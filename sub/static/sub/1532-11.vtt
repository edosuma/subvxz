00:02.480 --> 00:04.448
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.489
After five years in hell...

00:06.640 --> 00:08.483
...I've come home with only one goal:

00:08.640 --> 00:10.404
To save my city.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.289
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.761
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.163
To the rest of Starling City,
I'm someone else.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.449
I am something else.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.284
Previously on Arrow:

00:23.440 --> 00:27.286
If you wanna go out there, I can't stop
you. But I don't have to help you.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.562
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the justice you can't run from. Aah!

00:35.160 --> 00:36.969
Danny Brickwell. Street name's Brick.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.128
You are all part of my crew now.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.490
Together, we are gonna
take over the Glades.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.366
Oliver.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.966
I asked her to come here...

00:55.600 --> 00:57.602
...so she could bring you back to life.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.890
This is a duel, Oliver.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.481
With one of the most dangerous men alive.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.881
I wouldn't do it if I
didn't think I could win.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.691
I don't worry that you can beat him.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.202
I am terrified you won't kill him.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.766
That's not who you are anymore.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.402
And I'm afraid that Ra's is gonna use
your humanity against you.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.681
You're right.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.769
- I'll stay.
- Really?

01:30.160 --> 01:32.845
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure of one thing.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.164
I love you.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.369
Oliver.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.086
Drink this.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.128
- More herbs?
- Penicillin.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.681
For the infection.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.409
- You saved my life.
- The snow and cold helped.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.251
And your will to live. You should be dead.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.442
Did you know Maseo would bring me here?

02:53.400 --> 02:55.846
He was the one who told me
to meet you at this cabin.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.327
I didn't realize
that the two of you were still in contact.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.925
We are not.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.684
- Maseo.
- You're in no condition to stand.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.121
Help me.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.648
I'm glad you stayed.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.371
Then you'll be disappointed.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.929
When the storm passes,
I'll return to Nanda Parbat.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.411
Maseo.

03:36.040 --> 03:40.364
If Ra's finds out that you saved me,
betrayed him...

03:41.880 --> 03:43.609
...he's gonna kill you.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.207
Don't waste your breath or worries on me.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.524
Your concern should be for your home,
and what has become of it in your absence.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.086
Help.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.928
You picked the wrong alley.
You see, this one cuts off here at Carlyle.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.163
You pick the next one,
and you're free and clear to Reimer Avenue.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.725
Now, you wanna do this the hard way?

04:14.120 --> 04:15.406
Or the harder way?

04:16.240 --> 04:17.810
Hey.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.805
Run.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.011
Heard rumors about a mask
used to protect girls around here.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.690
Well, I guess you ain't her.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.764
This is Brick's town now.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.131
I think we should talk.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.169
This is gonna hurt a little.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.560
Just one more.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.083
Sorry. I warned you it was gonna hurt.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.810
You said a little.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.888
Yeah, well. Dig taught us how to suture.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.283
I guess Felicity got the hang of it
quicker than I did.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.442
- Where is Felicity?
- Let's talk about you.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.251
- What do you think you're doing out there?
- Same as you.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.722
I've had training from Oliver
and years on the streets.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.120
You have a law degree.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.209
Look. Heh.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.809
I get it. Heh. This?

05:23.960 --> 05:28.204
This isn't how you deal with grief, Laurel.
This is how you get yourself killed.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.691
Laurel, what the hell?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.844
- I'm fine.
- You are certifiable...

05:32.000 --> 05:35.322
...if you wear your sister's mask.
Yeah, you're right.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.681
But Oliver...

05:36.840 --> 05:37.887
...the Arrow.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.487
He's gone now.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.045
And like it or not,
the Canary sends the same message.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.408
- They fear her.
- No, Laurel.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.130
They fear your sister.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.560
Yeah.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.405
She's not here anymore.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.246
H9)'-

06:14.440 --> 06:17.489
What are you doing here?
Meeting's not for another three hours.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.564
I convinced Mayor Castle
it might be a good idea to move it up.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.882
What with a murderer
running amok in the city.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.489
- Isn't that what the police are for?
- Well, she wanted to speak to city leaders.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.449
And I'll help in whatever way I can.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.131
And by help,
you mean money and counsel...

06:33.280 --> 06:39.208
...not a suit powered by dwarf-star alloy
that fires lasers at people?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.727
Well, they aren't lasers.
That'd be ridiculous.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.526
They're compressed hard-light beams.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.445
And they don't actually fire
because I can't get anyone...

06:47.600 --> 06:51.161
...specifically you,
to help me fix the nanite chip.

06:51.320 --> 06:56.042
I already told you, Ray, I'm not interested
in helping you with your suicide mission.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.329
And there's nothing you can say or do
that is gonna change my mind.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.204
Are you ready to go?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.603
Hey, what are you doing here?

07:05.760 --> 07:07.842
With Brick running around the Glades...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.401
...I shouldn't leave my gear
anywhere he'd find it.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.721
What are you doing here?

07:11.880 --> 07:14.531
This neighborhood isn't a safe place
to hang out now.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.843
Uh, I'm not hanging out,
I'm just doing my job.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.280
Are we cool?

07:19.440 --> 07:22.842
It just seems like you've been avoiding me
ever since we had that moment.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.371
Moment?

07:24.520 --> 07:27.251
You have a very high opinion
on your kissing skills.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.563
Judging from your response,
you've got a high opinion of them too.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.651
- Unless you need a reminder.
- No, not right now.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.201
But, um, I'll see you later?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.530
What are you doing here?

07:47.680 --> 07:51.287
Went by your apartment see how packing
is going, only to discover that it's not.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.329
I can't leave.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.244
Not without knowing where Oliver is.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.483
I thought I made it clear
that leaving was not optional.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.120
No, actually,
you didn't make anything clear.

08:01.280 --> 08:05.251
You just ordered me to uproot my life
and didn't even give me a reason why.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.289
All you need to know is we're in danger.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.250
Every day we remain in Starling,
the danger grows greater.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.290
- Now get in the car, Thea.
- No.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.761
Not until you tell me the truth.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.248
You're not ready for the truth.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.609
Then I guess I'm not ready
to leave Starling City.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.400
- Yeah, I know. Yeah. Okay, I'm on it.
- Hi.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.686
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.764
You're not late. Castle's still hashing
things out with her people.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.009
Um, you heard from your sister?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.083
No. Why?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.481
Well, she's, uh, back in town.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.207
A girl came into the precinct
a few hours ago.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.443
Claimed a blond in a mask
and a black leather jacket saved her life.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.165
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.926
- Please take your seats.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.523
As you know, over the last week...

09:06.680 --> 09:09.286
...a criminal organization
headed by Danny Brickwell...

09:09.480 --> 09:12.370
...has been on a crime spree
unlike anything since Al Capone.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.887
Why don't you arrest him?

09:15.040 --> 09:19.329
We sent in an ESU team to do just that.
Most of those men are in the hospital now.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.925
Now we don't know where he is.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.046
Maybe if we had more men,
but that means more money.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.363
Uh, I've got a few bucks. Heh. Sorry.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.081
In fact, Palmer Technologies just made
a large donation to the S.C.P.D.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.164
But it'll take time for that equipment
to do any good.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.322
We need to consider calling in
the National Guard.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.763
I've always wanted to meet the mayor.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.127
Bring her and the aldermen.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.361
And kill the rest.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.400
Laurel.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.646
See? That's why I need a technosuit.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.484
Is Mayor Castle secure?

10:30.640 --> 10:31.766
Yeah.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.763
What about the aldermen?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.209
Brick's got them.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.525
Your penicillin tea taste like penicillin.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.168
We can't let him go back to the league.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.925
It's not our choice.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.162
Maybe we could have
changed Maseo's mind.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.402
But not his.

11:08.840 --> 11:09.966
Not Sarah's.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.124
"Sarab" is just a name
that Ra's al Ghul calls him.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.251
He's still your husband.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.081
Thank you.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.927
Maseo blames himself for what happened.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.811
It wasn't his fault.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.204
The line between grief and guilt
is a thin one.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.403
Sometimes, death is preferable
to the agony of life.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.880
Track is in there.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.326
Looks like a VIP area.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.723
Probably where they're holding Tatsu.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.488
- There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.
- This club is a Triad front.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.450
- It will be heavily guarded.
- Will you do anything to get her?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.090
Yes, I would.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.323
I told you it would be heavily guarded.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.926
You're late.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.162
- That's funny.
- I wasn't talking to you.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.210
- I was addressing your partner.
- What?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.441
Did you bring the item?

12:39.600 --> 12:40.965
What is she talking about?

12:41.120 --> 12:43.600
I wanna see my wife.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.090
I said, I want to see my wife.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.646
Once I know she's alive,
then you can have the Alpha.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.120
I'm sorry, Oliver.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.005
Maseo.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.845
What are you doing?

13:04.040 --> 13:05.530
H9)'-

13:06.320 --> 13:07.401
- How's your heart?
- Uh...

13:07.560 --> 13:10.166
Still beating. You okay?

13:10.320 --> 13:13.881
Couldn't help but notice nobody
in a green hood showed up to save the day.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.485
That's because he's gone.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.086
- What do you mean gone?
- It means we're on our own.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.489
That doesn't make any sense.
The Arrow's gone, but Sara's back.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.246
Wait.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.802
- What are you talking about?
- She's been taking out Brick's men solo.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.440
I've been getting reports.
Blond, masked, bo-staff.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.481
You didn't know?

13:32.640 --> 13:35.883
I've sort of been living
under a rock these days.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.683
Ask her to give me a call.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.166
Yeah.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.845
Will do.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.882
Jim Huffman, 34, eight arrests...

13:54.040 --> 13:55.769
...no convictions.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.402
Grand theft auto, B and E, drugs.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.847
You did pretty well flying solo.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.207
What made you decide
to start working for Brick?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.368
I'm not telling you anything.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.602
Sure about that?
I still have another heel.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.250
Kidding.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.362
You don't wanna talk about Brick?
That's fine.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.363
Then let's talk about something else.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.409
Why would you murder...

14:18.560 --> 14:20.005
...Julio Salazar?

14:20.440 --> 14:21.771
Salazar?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.325
Head of Los Halcones?

14:23.480 --> 14:25.642
I had nothing to do
with him getting popped.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.529
Well, that's not what your file says.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.080
See?

14:31.240 --> 14:33.720
What kind of game is this?
You just wrote that down.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.245
You making this stuff up.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.244
Actually, I can charge you
with whatever crime that I want.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.927
Of course, then they'd have to keep you
in custody until the trial.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.210
Good news, Bell Reve, it's a lot
more comfortable than Iron Heights.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.286
Bell Reve's where the Los Halcones
are locked up.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.649
They'd think I offed Salazar.
I won't last two seconds in there.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.326
Tell me where I can find Danny,
and you won't have to.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.562
He'll kill me.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.411
- Charges filed by Dinah Laurel Lance...
- Stop. Stop!

15:06.320 --> 15:08.971
I'll tell you where you can find Brick.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.410
If you're looking for Thea...

15:23.560 --> 15:24.641
...she's not here.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.881
I know.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.883
- I came to see you.
- Ha, ha.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.569
Following me, Mr. Harper?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.643
You need to stay away from her.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.282
I don't know why you want her to leave,
but I'm not letting her go with you.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.126
Well, thank you for that.
I was in need of some humor.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.805
I wasn't joking.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.641
You're a poison.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.201
You put her in Ra's al Ghul's gun sights?

15:47.360 --> 15:49.328
You had her kill Sara?

15:52.240 --> 15:54.686
Thea knows nothing about Sara...

15:54.840 --> 15:56.080
...and she never will.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.163
That's where you're wrong.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.330
I know her.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.251
She'll get to the truth,
no matter how well you're hiding it.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.206
And when she does find out you've
been lying, you're gonna lose her forever.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.529
Trust me, I know from experience.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.322
This is a family matter, Mr. Harper.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.761
And you are not family.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.807
- Sit.
- Okay.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.771
Are you okay?

16:27.960 --> 16:29.007
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.807
Armed gunman attacking you, that had
to have brought back a few bad memories.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.561
Yeah, when it started...

16:37.760 --> 16:40.809
...all I could think about
was the night Anna died.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.249
But when that gunman charged us,
all I could think about was...

16:45.000 --> 16:46.604
...saving you.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.845
You were right.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.328
I've been going about this all wrong.

16:59.240 --> 17:04.406
When I started the A.T.O.M. Project,
it was all about avenging Anna.

17:05.760 --> 17:10.402
But what it has become about
is protecting the people I care for.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.006
- You mean the city?
- No.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.763
I mean you.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.211
You sure you wanna use that?
We have other weapons here.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.647
- It was Sara's.
- Roy.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.404
I thought we're on the same page.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.166
That was before Brick
kidnapped three aldermen.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.125
Laurel knows where they are.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.722
We put their location in Felicity's
program, but Brick's moving them.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.884
We can take him out en route,
but the window's closing.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.048
Laurel, monitor us from here.
Talk me and Roy in.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.646
No. That's not how this is gonna work.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.962
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

17:50.120 --> 17:51.406
You're not your sister.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.642
You think I don't know that?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.330
You lost a brother.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.563
If there's anyone who I thought
would understand, it would be you.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.605
Stay close to her.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.050
We should have got the mayor.
That was a loss.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.808
You'll never get me, masked man.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.049
Come on, throw everything that you got!

18:49.640 --> 18:51.165
Let's go.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.089
Laurel. Laurel, watch your 6.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.206
Lucky for you, I don't like hitting women.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.121
Go, go, go!

19:17.200 --> 19:19.043
Bad choice.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.284
This one's on you.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.811
No. No.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.041
No.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.244
Danny Brickwell is still at large tonight
after abducting three aldermen...

19:46.400 --> 19:48.607
...from city hall earlier this evening.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.491
Though he's managed
to evade S. C. P.D. thus far...

19:51.640 --> 19:54.484
- Dad.
- Hey, you okay?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.120
- Yeah.
- Two vigilantes associated with the Arrow...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.362
...the Red Arrow and the woman in black...

19:59.520 --> 20:00.885
...in pursuit.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.930
Reports now trickling in
suggest a confrontation...

20:04.080 --> 20:05.650
Your sister did her best.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.641
Channel 52's running cell-phone footage
of her and the guy in the red hood.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.165
Did Sara talk to you?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.084
What? No.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.685
Uh, she hasn't, not yet.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.649
She must know we're seeing this.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.802
Mayor, there's a call for you on line one.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.440
- Take a message.
- It's Danny Brickwell.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.046
Mr. Brickwell?

20:32.200 --> 20:36.569
How is your evening going, Madam Mayor?
Mine's not going too well.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.042
Because your city's vigilante problem
became mine earlier tonight.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.326
And he's forced my hand.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.608
Look, you have demands,
just get on with it.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.529
No demands, just Shakespeare.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.926
Julius Caesar.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.889
Act five, scene two.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.202
They stand, and would have parley.

20:51.360 --> 20:54.807
The war stops and together they converse.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.724
I would have parley with you.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.450
That isn't what we're doing now?

20:58.600 --> 21:01.046
In person. Brockton Point, one hour.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.964
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.884
And certainly not in person.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.850
You are already going to one funeral,
Madam Mayor.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.731
If you wanna make it a hat trick,
that's your prerogative.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.247
Me? I'll be at Brockton Point.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.686
If you came to see
how packing is going, it's not.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.405
No.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.288
I came to apologize.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.569
I don't wanna lose you, Thea.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.048
But at the same time,
sharing the truth with you is sometimes...

21:32.200 --> 21:33.361
...difficult for me.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.804
Well, maybe you'll get
better with practice.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.844
- Who are we running from?
- His name is Ra's al Ghul.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.445
Why does he wanna kill you?

21:43.600 --> 21:47.047
Ra's has a particular code of honor
he feels I violated.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.369
And he's marked me
and my family for death.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.767
I fell in with Ra's because I was consumed
by the death of my wife.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.811
And I was marked for death because
of the undertaking that killed my son.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.763
You're all I have left, Thea.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.804
Keeping you safe is all that matters.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.291
Please let me.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.609
Alderman Richard Ford...

22:12.760 --> 22:14.410
...was in his second term at city hall.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.171
He leaves behind a wife and two children.

22:17.320 --> 22:21.689
The city asks the family's privacy
be respected during this trying time.

22:21.840 --> 22:26.084
- Though no official statement...
- Laurel? I'm sorry. I can come back.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.123
No, it's okay. it's...

22:28.680 --> 22:29.761
ls everything okay?

22:30.640 --> 22:33.086
I came to ask you the same thing.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.321
Canary.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.722
I guess you came
to talk some sense into me.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.807
Seems like you could use some.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.287
I'm not sure you're gonna have to bother.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.442
Brick, he...

22:46.600 --> 22:49.285
He killed someone tonight.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.285
In front of me.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.522
I thought that being...

22:54.720 --> 22:57.644
Being Sara would make it hurt less.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.651
But instead, it just...

23:01.200 --> 23:02.804
It caused more pain.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.404
Not just for me.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.842
So you don't have to worry.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.486
I'm not gonna be putting
on that mask again.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.362
I'm not strong enough to fight for Sara.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.924
Maybe you're not supposed to.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.204
Maybe it's not about Sara. Or Oliver.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.001
Or anyone else
that we care about who we lost.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.083
Maybe what we've been doing...

23:32.240 --> 23:35.244
...we've been doing it
because there are people we care about...

23:35.400 --> 23:38.290
...that are still alive.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.809
Maybe we're doing it for them.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.885
I thought you quit.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.205
He's confident.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.523
Meeting here in the open
where any police sniper could take him out.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.729
Because he's got men who could take
the hostages out. Checkmate.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.723
Madam Mayor.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.683
All this for me?

24:05.880 --> 24:07.882
I'm impressed.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.924
What are you doing here, Palmer?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.164
Wanna make yourself look important?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.481
Good luck with that.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.085
Star City.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.320
Seems more like Brick City to me.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.090
The night is young.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.766
Tough talk.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.400
Too bad all you got is money to back it up.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.847
But you can't fix this with money, Palmer.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.240
I don't know.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.481
I got a lot of money.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.611
Say what you came here to say.
We can all end this farce.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.527
Okay.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.883
I've still got two of your men.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.401
If you want them back, it's simple.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.130
Get out of the Glades.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.966
Your city servicemen,
especially the police, evacuate.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.567
- You're out of your mind.
- You've got until midnight tomorrow.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.685
And if I even see a hint of a blue,
your city yes-men?

24:58.840 --> 25:00.251
They will be buried.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.368
We won't abandon an entire district.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.322
They did in L.A. in '92, didn't they?

25:05.520 --> 25:08.603
Besides, you don't want every news station
in the country...

25:08.760 --> 25:11.604
...showing footage of the murders
of the aldermen, do you?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.001
You have 23 hours 59 minutes.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.481
I suggest you move your sweet ass.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.931
Captain Lance?

25:34.080 --> 25:37.687
Brick wants every cop out the
Glades, or he's gonna kill his hostages.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.161
We need help. We need it now.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.007
Look, I know you said the Arrow is gone.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.240
Are you sure about that?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.164
Yes, I am.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.207
But I think I know where
to find the Canary.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.806
- The storm has passed.
- Maseo...

26:00.440 --> 26:03.250
...you don't have to leave.
You can still have a life.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.925
Why do you assume I want one?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.691
Because I know you,
and this isn't who you are.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.366
I love you.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.727
No matter who you think you've become.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.650
Maseo?

26:32.880 --> 26:34.484
They found you.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.400
Sarab, what are you doing here?

26:48.360 --> 26:50.840
Ra's al Ghul wants Oliver Queen's remains.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.044
I found no body, only tracks.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.486
Which led here.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.443
Queen is still alive.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.371
But there is no one here.
I was just about to go.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.247
Brothers.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.890
We should go.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.851
Traitor.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.811
She's the mother of my son.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.241
- You do not get to judge me.
- Too late.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.843
This concludes our business.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.890
Only if the serum is genuine.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.166
It's genuine.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.569
Then you should have no problem
with me testing it.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.442
It's a fake. Kill them all.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.406
Go, go, go!

28:46.000 --> 28:48.765
That alderman died
because of the decision that I made.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.562
And there's no Mirakuru
to blame this time.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.121
Don't take that on yourself, man.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.610
That was Brick.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.325
What's that?

29:05.600 --> 29:09.161
Sometimes, me and Oliver
would come down here...

29:09.320 --> 29:11.846
...after, you know, tough nights.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.407
He would pour this.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.842
Look up and say:

29:20.320 --> 29:21.481
What does that mean?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.210
I have no earthly idea.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.001
To Oliver.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.681
To Oliver.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.963
We can't do this without Oliver, can we?

29:37.080 --> 29:38.445
Felicity was right.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.887
Actually, I was wrong.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.884
- And I'm not wrong a lot.
- I talked to my father.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.407
The mayor will cave
and seek control of the Glades.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.370
- They'll evacuate police force.
- It's up to us to stop Brick.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.602
Us? What, are you and Laurel a team now?

29:51.760 --> 29:54.411
I was wrong
when I said Oliver's mission was over.

29:54.600 --> 29:58.127
Because it's not just Oliver's
mission anymore. It is ours.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.725
It's our home under attack.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.966
For all we know, Oliver could be dead,
and Sara certainly is.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.521
But there are people that are still alive.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.011
People who need us.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.604
Okay.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.843
First, we have to find out
where those aldermen are.

30:15.040 --> 30:18.442
- It's a bad idea.
- So you've said, repeatedly.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.763
But it's my decision,
so do as I tell you, and give the order.

30:21.960 --> 30:25.885
You give it. You wanna pull my men
out the Glades, fine. That's your funeral.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.883
I don't want any part of it. Excuse me.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.521
Hello.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.007
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sara.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.561
Where you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.083
I'm sorry.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.651
I'm here.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.006
Are you okay?

30:41.160 --> 30:43.811
Well, yeah. I've been better.
I'm sure you have been to.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.450
Why didn't you call me sooner?

30:45.600 --> 30:47.443
It's complicated.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.840
How are you doing this?

30:49.000 --> 30:52.368
I fed recordings of Sara's voice
through a symbolic algorithm.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.285
Daddy, I'm sorry that I've been away...

30:55.440 --> 30:57.408
...but I don't want you to worry about me.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.047
I'm fine.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.042
- And I'm here to help.
- Okay. What do you need from me?

31:04.200 --> 31:06.441
Tell me everything about the hostages.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.448
No matter how seemingly insignificant.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.967
I don't know how
their favorite color will help.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.360
There has to be something.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.285
Intel that you couldn't use
because of the mayor's orders.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.762
I wish. The clock's running down
on these guys too.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.049
One has a heart condition.
If his pacemaker isn't recharged soon...

31:23.200 --> 31:24.486
...we'll lose him.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.404
Daddy, that actually helps.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.684
But I have to go now.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.571
Wait, just listen to me. Be careful, okay?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.405
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.050
I'll be careful.

31:37.200 --> 31:40.443
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you too, Daddy.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.165
One alderman has a pacemaker.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.369
If it's remote programmable...
It will have a GPS.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.761
It'll take me a few minutes to log onto it.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.604
Gear up.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.804
This one, breakthrough.
All we need's one...

32:03.280 --> 32:05.886
- Hi.
- Yeah, hey. Just one second.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.170
- Sorry.
- What's going on?

32:10.360 --> 32:12.044
I need the keys to your helicopter.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.321
How would you fly it?

32:13.480 --> 32:18.884
I got that covered, just give me the keys.
I promise I will not crash it.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.366
I got to be honest.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.091
I'd feel more confident
in your aeronautic abilities...

32:23.240 --> 32:27.370
...if you knew, for instance,
that helicopters don't actually have keys.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.600
They don't have keys?

32:29.800 --> 32:31.564
- No, they...
- Is it on the roof?

32:31.760 --> 32:34.843
- Yeah, it's on the roof.
- Thank you.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.243
I'll hold you to the no-crash promise.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.244
You realize it's been five years
since I've flown one of these?

32:43.400 --> 32:46.085
- Like riding a bicycle, I hope.
- We have Brick's location?

32:46.240 --> 32:48.527
According to the last signal
from the pacemaker...

32:48.680 --> 32:51.411
...Brick has the alderman
in a warehouse at 16th and Kent.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.891
Not for long, he isn't.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.642
We got a chopper outside. Take a look.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.041
Roger that. Checking it now.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.450
I guess we're even now.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.125
Follow the hallway 2O yards.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.650
Turn left.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.041
Aldermen.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.609
Come on. Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.926
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go, go.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.368
Dig, I'm gonna need you
to find me a way out of here.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.920
Copy that.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.447
I still don't like hitting women.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.123
But I could make an exception for you.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.206
So come and get me.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.522
You're getting warmer.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.763
Because I will keep this city safe.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.286
By killing anyone
that doesn't do what you say?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.929
Something like that.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.764
Warmer.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.763
Warmer.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.645
We're not going to let you...

35:23.720 --> 35:24.881
It's done.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.485
The bodies will not be found.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.481
Okay, Maseo, I get that you wanted
to go back before, but that was before.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.450
When Ra's finds out
that you've betrayed the league...

35:39.800 --> 35:41.484
Maseo?

35:43.200 --> 35:46.170
- Why the hell did you do that?
- I didn't. You did.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.444
In a successful attempt to escape.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.244
Or you could just come back
to Starling City with me.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.482
Ahem. Can I talk to you for a minute?

36:34.640 --> 36:37.086
If you're gonna bluff
with a fake virus sample...

36:37.240 --> 36:38.571
...let me in on it.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.290
I wasn't bluffing.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.488
What does that mean?

36:42.640 --> 36:44.881
That the Alpha we stole was a fake?

36:45.040 --> 36:47.805
That Amanda Waller knew
I would try something like this.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.128
She must've switched the vial
before I took it.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.647
Maseo, you were willing to risk...

36:53.800 --> 36:57.247
...letting hundreds,
maybe thousands of people die?

36:57.440 --> 36:58.521
For my wife.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.726
Yes.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.402
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for my family.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.411
Thank you.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.891
You saved my life.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.765
Dad.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.568
Both aldermen are back with their families.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.449
Nice job.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.887
- For all the good it did.
- What does that mean?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.963
Mayor Castle caved.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.010
- She's pulling S.C.P.D. out of the Glades.
- But why?

37:46.200 --> 37:48.521
Brick doesn't have the aldermen anymore.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.284
No, but he has the home address...

37:50.440 --> 37:53.808
...of every council member and their family
and the means to hurt them.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.764
Played that card 15 minutes ago.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.361
Hey, sweetheart... Hey.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.490
How about we cry
over each other's shoulders...

38:01.640 --> 38:03.961
...over dinner at the
Chinese place you love.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.770
I can't.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.160
I'm sorry.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.885
What's going on with you?
Why are you trying to avoid me?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.642
I'll explain everything.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.531
- Just not tonight.
- You okay?

38:19.440 --> 38:22.205
I'm fine, Daddy. I'm fine.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.725
- Are you ready to leave?
- No.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.289
I'm not leaving.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.770
Is this supposed to make up
for me missing your adolescence?

38:55.920 --> 38:58.924
This routine of listening
and disobeying me?

38:59.080 --> 39:00.491
Just hear me out.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.369
You told me that we were in danger.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.171
You even told me who was after us...

39:05.360 --> 39:10.048
...but what you didn't tell me is why?

39:10.240 --> 39:11.605
Yes, I did.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.489
Because Ra's al Ghul wants us dead.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.722
It's pretty much the case anywhere we go.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.210
So why run?

39:21.120 --> 39:22.804
Why not stay and fight?

39:24.280 --> 39:27.648
Seven months ago, I asked you to teach me.

39:27.840 --> 39:31.765
To teach me how to not be afraid
and how to not get hurt.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.364
So why are you asking me
to be afraid now?

39:36.560 --> 39:39.530
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.762
- You should be very afraid.
- Well, I'm not.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.161
Because my father taught me not to be.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.843
He taught me to stand my ground,
how to not give an inch in a battle.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.049
I'm not afraid of this man,
and you shouldn't be either.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.124
He should be afraid of us.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.882
Then we'll stay.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.163
Your helicopter...

40:11.320 --> 40:13.004
...is back on the roof.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.286
I didn't crash it.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.124
It turns out...

40:17.080 --> 40:19.208
...it actually had keys. And this.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.565
The reason you couldn't get
the nanite chip to function...

40:28.720 --> 40:31.007
...is because what you actually need...

40:33.600 --> 40:35.568
...is a quantum processor.

40:37.240 --> 40:41.609
- The design is elegant.
- Mm-hm.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.725
I thought you weren't gonna help me
on my suicide mission?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.329
Well, that's the thing.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.564
With my help, you might not end up dead.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.647
H9)'-

40:59.400 --> 41:03.007
Thought you knew about this neighborhood
turning into a scene from The Purge.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.241
We didn't open tonight.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.171
I forgot my music files here,
and I've got another gig.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.891
Are you cheating on me
with another club manager?

41:10.040 --> 41:12.042
Well, I heard a rumor
you were leaving town.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.320
Happy to say that those rumors are false.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.165
That's good news. For both of us.

41:18.320 --> 41:20.163
Don't get so ahead of yourself.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.931
My hard drive's up there.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.770
Take your time.
