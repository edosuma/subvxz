12:18.156 --> 12:23.427
Well, because I was
in tremendous,

12:23.494 --> 12:25.863
I guess, rage,

12:25.930 --> 12:29.067
and because...

12:29.133 --> 12:32.570
I could think only
of killing Ronald Martin.

12:32.636 --> 12:36.808
Did you expect
to change your mind?

12:36.875 --> 12:39.210
No. No, uh,
it's not what it was about.

12:39.277 --> 12:41.345
<i>[ Bobby ]</i>
<i>What was it about?</i>

12:41.412 --> 12:46.751
<i>I wanted to know if</i>
<i>I was evil for wanting</i>
<i>to kill Ronald Martin.</i>

12:46.818 --> 12:50.955
I-I wanted to know
if God would understand.

12:51.022 --> 12:53.625
And how did
Rabbi Warner respond?

12:53.692 --> 12:55.460
He said that God
would understand.

12:55.527 --> 12:58.297
<i>[ Bobby ]</i>
<i>Did he say anything else?</i>

12:58.363 --> 13:01.166
<i>[ Braun ]</i>
<i>He said that between</i>
<i>Ronald Martin going free...</i>

13:01.233 --> 13:03.702
and Ronald Martin being dead,

13:03.768 --> 13:09.141
it was more moral
for him to be dead.

13:13.612 --> 13:17.950
Mrs. White,
thanks for coming.
What's this all about?

13:18.017 --> 13:22.588
Uh, this is gonna sound
a little bit out there,
but just the same, we, uh--

13:25.591 --> 13:28.594
You know, David and Melanie,
maybe it would be best
for you two...

13:28.661 --> 13:30.796
to wait outside
at first.

13:30.863 --> 13:33.065
And I'll call you back in
later, okay?

13:33.132 --> 13:35.067
Okay.

13:45.111 --> 13:47.247
It's gonna hit the fan
in there now.
Yeah, I know.

13:47.313 --> 13:49.482
How are you feeling?
Oh, I'm good.

13:49.549 --> 13:52.718
Long as I sleep on my side
and he doesn't start
kicking at night--

13:52.785 --> 13:57.090
I hate the heartburn.
Some people say that means
he's gonna be born with hair.

13:57.157 --> 13:59.760
Oh.
<i>[ David ]</i>
<i>You hope it's just hair.</i>

13:59.826 --> 14:01.594
We should have done
that amnio thing.

14:02.996 --> 14:05.699
So do you have kids?

14:05.766 --> 14:07.834
No.

14:07.901 --> 14:11.004
<i>I got out of the car.</i>

14:11.071 --> 14:14.941
I started walking toward him
with the gun in my hand.

14:15.008 --> 14:17.678
- So you went there to kill him?
- Yeah.

14:17.744 --> 14:20.547
And I hoped I would.

14:20.614 --> 14:26.287
But, uh, I also knew
the reality of
going through with it.

14:26.353 --> 14:29.456
And, um,
as I approached him,

14:29.523 --> 14:32.526
I became less and less sure
that I would.

14:32.593 --> 14:34.795
Less sure?
How?

14:34.862 --> 14:38.065
I kept expecting
this impulse...

14:38.132 --> 14:42.436
to, um, suddenly, uh--

14:44.138 --> 14:47.609
to suddenly tell me that
I was about to do evil.

14:47.675 --> 14:51.946
<i>I-I-I half expected</i>
<i>something in my brain...</i>

14:52.013 --> 14:55.483
to say,
"Stop. This is wrong."

14:55.550 --> 14:57.519
Did that impulse come?

14:58.853 --> 15:00.988
No.

15:02.624 --> 15:05.260
And as I got to him,

15:05.327 --> 15:09.097
the sensation that I felt
was that, um,

15:09.164 --> 15:11.166
this was right.

15:11.233 --> 15:15.637
Ronald Martin
should be dead.

15:15.703 --> 15:20.675
And as I raised the gun
and-and-and pointed it,

15:20.742 --> 15:22.711
I knew it more.

15:22.778 --> 15:25.781
<i>My-My hand didn't shake.</i>

15:25.848 --> 15:28.651
It was steady.

15:28.717 --> 15:32.020
When I pulled the trigger,

15:32.087 --> 15:35.390
I saw the blood shoot out
from his neck.

15:37.393 --> 15:40.396
<i>I, um--</i>

15:40.463 --> 15:44.567
I aimed for his head,
but I shot him in the neck--

15:44.633 --> 15:46.635
in the throat.

15:46.702 --> 15:51.740
And, um,
I heard him choking,

15:51.807 --> 15:56.079
and, uh,
I remember thinking...

15:58.014 --> 16:00.049
this is godly,

16:01.150 --> 16:03.186
<i>because, um,</i>

16:03.252 --> 16:07.456
<i>this man had strangled</i>
<i>my daughter.</i>

16:07.523 --> 16:12.261
<i>How fitting that, um,</i>
<i>he should choke.</i>

16:13.697 --> 16:16.265
That seemed to be...

16:16.332 --> 16:19.469
the most godly thing
in all of this.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.840
And, um,

16:23.907 --> 16:26.175
then I pulled
the trigger again.

16:26.243 --> 16:31.881
I fired the gun,
and he was gone.

16:31.948 --> 16:35.219
Do you regret killing
Ronald Martin?

16:37.354 --> 16:39.289
I, um--

16:42.692 --> 16:46.263
I regret the pain
I brought his family.

16:46.330 --> 16:49.399
<i>I know their pain.</i>

16:49.466 --> 16:51.468
<i>But...</i>

16:51.535 --> 16:55.105
<i>I believe it is just</i>
<i>for him to be dead.</i>

16:55.172 --> 16:59.109
I-- I do.
I--

17:01.812 --> 17:07.151
I believe I owed it
to my daughter to kill him.

17:07.217 --> 17:13.157
And, um, I pray to God...

17:13.223 --> 17:15.560
that she knows.

17:24.234 --> 17:26.637
Did you actually expect me
to go along with this?

17:26.704 --> 17:31.176
Mrs. White, I don't know you,
and I have no
expectations whatsoever.

17:31.242 --> 17:33.578
I'm just saying that
they say they love each other.

17:33.645 --> 17:37.148
They say they plan
to be married one day.
I'm saying...

17:37.215 --> 17:40.686
he has a better chance
of staying out of jail
if they get married now.

17:40.752 --> 17:43.822
Do you even see
how despicable this is?

17:43.889 --> 17:47.058
This may be
in your daughter's
best interest.

17:47.125 --> 17:51.062
I've spoken to a social worker,
and all I ask is that
you meet with her--

17:51.129 --> 17:53.064
Oh!
so that we can--

17:53.131 --> 17:55.301
Mrs. White!

18:03.142 --> 18:07.613
I have a son
who's a few years younger
than your daughter.

18:07.679 --> 18:12.719
I know. Now,
meet with the social worker.

18:12.785 --> 18:15.755
If you're still against it,
I'll respect that
and back off.

18:15.822 --> 18:18.658
But your daughter wants
to keep her baby,

18:18.725 --> 18:23.530
and this is more complicated
than you know.

18:23.596 --> 18:26.766
I just ask you to meet
with the social worker.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.337
Please?

18:34.241 --> 18:38.145
You did great.
But now is where it gets tough.

18:38.211 --> 18:42.815
Let me tell you a few things
about Silverman. He stays still,
almost motionless sometimes.

18:42.882 --> 18:46.619
He'll slowly move towards you.
He won't shout
or thump his chest.

18:46.686 --> 18:50.323
He just moves in very slowly,
trying to intimidate you.

18:50.390 --> 18:54.027
They call him the picker-off,
'cause he stands still,
then he strikes.

18:54.094 --> 18:57.297
You just speak
from what's in there.

18:57.364 --> 18:59.566
Don't fall for word games.

18:59.633 --> 19:02.169
Don't try to make the jury
think you're smarter than him.

19:02.235 --> 19:04.371
You don't have
to be careful here.

19:04.437 --> 19:08.241
Everybody knows what you did,
and we're not hiding anything.

19:11.912 --> 19:13.314
[ Knocking ]
We're back.

19:13.381 --> 19:16.016
- All right.
- Thanks, Bobby.

19:16.083 --> 19:19.187
[ Danny ]
Let's go.

19:26.727 --> 19:28.897
I don't mean to be harsh
with you, Danny.
Understand.

19:28.963 --> 19:32.633
I got a defense here--
I understand you perfectly.

19:43.277 --> 19:45.547
She'll be here any second.
I just called
their office again.

19:45.614 --> 19:49.684
Okay.
Thank you.
Ooh!

19:51.986 --> 19:54.356
There he goes again.
Feel.

19:54.423 --> 19:57.158
He's a little rascal,
isn't he?

19:57.226 --> 19:59.761
Yeah.
[ Groans ]

19:59.828 --> 20:04.066
<i>That one kind of hurt.</i>
<i>Mama?</i>

20:04.133 --> 20:06.468
I really wanna keep my baby.

20:06.535 --> 20:09.104
I know that
I can take care of him.
I know I can.

20:09.171 --> 20:13.608
We've talked about this
before, Melanie.
You're 14 years old.

20:13.675 --> 20:16.946
<i>You have school</i>
<i>and you have your life</i>
<i>ahead of you.</i>

20:19.849 --> 20:23.986
Mommy, this is my baby.

20:26.255 --> 20:28.023
[ Knocking ]

20:28.090 --> 20:32.327
Hi. Uh, are you Melanie?

20:34.764 --> 20:36.699
[ Judge Vinocour ]
Mr. Silverman, you can begin.

20:51.481 --> 20:54.150
You were aware of
what you were doing
when you killed Ronald Martin?

20:54.217 --> 20:56.019
Acutely.

20:56.086 --> 20:59.489
And you felt God would
understand your doing this?

21:00.824 --> 21:04.227
I wasn't sure.
That's why I went
to my rabbi.

21:04.294 --> 21:09.800
<i>Is it your thinking</i>
<i>that one may commit</i>
<i>a premeditated murder...</i>

21:09.866 --> 21:11.902
so long as he gets
a note from his rabbi?

21:11.968 --> 21:15.472
<i>The jury heard my thinking,</i>
<i>Mr. Silverman.</i>

21:15.539 --> 21:19.376
Is it your belief,

21:19.443 --> 21:23.347
sitting here today
in this courtroom,

21:23.414 --> 21:26.016
that God would embrace
your bloodletting?

21:26.082 --> 21:27.918
It is.

21:27.984 --> 21:30.654
Would you care to offer
authority for this position?

21:30.721 --> 21:32.990
Exodus:

21:33.057 --> 21:35.792
"He who fatally
strikes a man
shall be put to death."

21:35.859 --> 21:39.196
<i>Genesis:</i>
<i>"Whoever sheds the blood</i>
<i>of a man,</i>

21:39.263 --> 21:42.199
<i>by man shall his blood</i>
<i>be shed."</i>

21:42.266 --> 21:47.204
Then according
to Exodus and Genesis,

21:47.271 --> 21:49.707
should you now be put to death?

21:49.774 --> 21:53.210
I didn't take
an innocent life.
According to the Torah,

21:53.277 --> 21:56.681
<i>Ronald Martin had forfeited</i>
<i>his right to live...</i>

21:56.748 --> 21:58.983
by murdering
an innocent person.

21:59.050 --> 22:02.987
- I had a Jewish right
to do what I did.
- Jewish right?

22:03.054 --> 22:04.756
A Jewish right.

22:04.822 --> 22:08.092
I'll assume you're aware
of the Talmud's view
on capital punishment?

22:08.160 --> 22:12.330
I'll assume you're aware that
when Eichmann directed the
murder of six million people,

22:12.397 --> 22:16.234
we kidnapped him,
brought him to Jerusalem
and hanged him.

22:16.301 --> 22:19.637
- And then we cheered.
- Eichmann was responsible
for mass murder.

22:19.704 --> 22:22.507
Are you comparing
Ronald Martin to Eichmann?

22:22.574 --> 22:27.813
I'm suggesting that sometimes,
vengeance is right.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.316
And I won't let you
stand up there as a rabbi--

22:31.383 --> 22:35.053
- Move to strike.
- This is my day in court,
Rabbi, not yours!

22:35.120 --> 22:37.890
<i>[ Gavel Banging ]</i>
<i>[ Judge Vinocour ]</i>
<i>All right! Silence!</i>

22:37.956 --> 22:41.860
Be quiet.
The witness may finish.

22:45.197 --> 22:50.303
<i>You come into this room</i>
<i>wearing your yarmulke...</i>

22:50.369 --> 22:55.441
to send a message to that jury
that you condemn me as a Jew.

22:55.508 --> 22:59.245
No, Dr. Braun.

22:59.312 --> 23:01.814
I condemn you as a murderer.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.284
But, Rabbi,
you're in here as a Jew.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.220
And you're testifying
as a Jew...

23:07.286 --> 23:11.524
that you had the right
to commit a religious murder?

23:11.590 --> 23:16.362
- Because to forgive a murderer
is not the Jewish way.
- You mean, it's not <i>your</i> way.

23:16.429 --> 23:20.366
When God confronted Cain
after the murder of Abel,
he didn't forgive him.

23:20.434 --> 23:25.639
He shouted out to him,
"Your brother's blood cries out
to me from the ground."

23:25.705 --> 23:29.243
- God shouted that!
- And God shouted out to you?

23:29.309 --> 23:32.612
No! My daughter did!

23:34.214 --> 23:38.085
Her blood cried out to me!

23:38.152 --> 23:40.154
Her blood!

23:41.555 --> 23:45.492
And that's the real truth,
isn't it, Dr. Braun?

23:45.559 --> 23:47.862
When you raised that gun,

23:47.928 --> 23:51.331
you didn't hear
Exodus or Genesis.

23:51.398 --> 23:55.002
You didn't hear
the Talmud or the Torah.
You didn't see God.

23:55.069 --> 23:59.206
You only saw
your daughter's blood.

24:02.409 --> 24:05.713
And that's the real truth.

24:10.050 --> 24:13.254
[ Woman ]
This isn't just changing diapers
or taking care of a baby.

24:13.321 --> 24:17.092
This is raising a child.
Do you think you really know
what that entails?

24:18.759 --> 24:21.396
Probably not,
but, um, we're ready to learn.

24:21.462 --> 24:26.467
Forget the
"takes a village" crap.
The village is out of order.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.769
The child needs parents.

24:28.837 --> 24:30.638
Look, we'll do
whatever we have to.

24:30.705 --> 24:33.508
How long have you two
been together?

24:33.574 --> 24:36.211
Will they arrest me again
if I tell?

24:36.277 --> 24:38.146
No.

24:38.213 --> 24:40.949
Almost two years.

24:41.016 --> 24:43.552
<i>[ Woman ] Do you have</i>
<i>a place of dwelling?</i>
Yes.

24:43.619 --> 24:47.723
I have a two-bedroom
in Brighton. We plan to turn
the extra room into a nursery.

24:47.789 --> 24:52.894
- [ Sighs ]
How much money do you make?
- 660 a week.

24:52.961 --> 24:55.564
<i>But I'm supposed</i>
<i>to be promoted to foreman</i>
<i>in October,</i>

24:55.631 --> 24:58.367
which takes me to 725.

24:58.434 --> 25:03.139
- Plus, I get insurance
for Melanie and the baby.
- And I'm not covered right now.

25:03.205 --> 25:06.575
Hmm.

25:06.642 --> 25:08.710
Uh, do you work, ma'am?

25:10.712 --> 25:12.681
I work for a courier service.

25:12.748 --> 25:15.885
<i>And how much do you make?</i>
490 a week.

25:28.498 --> 25:30.933
Danny.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.802
It's 10:30.

25:40.677 --> 25:43.313
Couldn't sleep.

25:48.785 --> 25:52.956
- Closing arguments?
- Yeah.

25:55.192 --> 25:57.861
Look, Bobby, I--

26:01.932 --> 26:04.935
You and I go back
to high school together.

26:07.037 --> 26:12.376
I understand Gerald
doing what he did.

26:12.443 --> 26:14.878
But you, I--

26:16.547 --> 26:18.882
Say what you have to say.

26:18.949 --> 26:23.421
You know Gerald Braun
like you know me.

26:23.487 --> 26:29.427
You had to know
he was considering to go out
and shoot Ronald Martin.

26:29.493 --> 26:34.265
You may not have thought
he was going to, but you knew
there was a possibility, Danny.

26:34.332 --> 26:36.835
You think I wanted him
to execute Ronald Martin?

26:36.901 --> 26:39.570
I think that
you could have stopped him,
and you didn't.

26:39.637 --> 26:42.974
<i>Guilty by</i>
<i>commission or omission,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

26:43.041 --> 26:46.377
But invoking God
to excuse you, Danny?

26:46.444 --> 26:50.248
It just-- It--
It makes me ill.

26:50.314 --> 26:53.418
This from a man
who routinely
defends murderers.

26:53.485 --> 26:56.187
We both chose our professions.
I'm a criminal defense attorney.

26:56.254 --> 26:59.924
They see me coming.
You're a rabbi.

27:04.128 --> 27:07.932
When Donna Braun was murdered,

27:07.999 --> 27:10.235
Jerry--

27:10.302 --> 27:13.905
Jerry, he-he became lost.

27:16.308 --> 27:18.310
And so did you.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.258
There's an ancient custom
in Jewish law.

27:33.325 --> 27:35.160
[ Speaks Hebrew ]

27:35.227 --> 27:37.730
Translated, it means
if a Jew is found murdered,

27:37.797 --> 27:41.000
let him be buried
in his bloody clothes.

27:41.066 --> 27:43.836
<i>We bury him</i>
<i>as we found him...</i>

27:43.903 --> 27:48.941
to provoke in people fury
and the desire to avenge.

27:50.376 --> 27:52.978
Donna Braun was buried...

27:53.046 --> 27:56.416
in the clothes
she was strangled in.

27:57.817 --> 28:00.921
Does this make
vengeance right?
Of course not.

28:00.987 --> 28:05.926
But it does help explain
the mind-set of Gerald Braun.

28:05.992 --> 28:10.797
<i>Filled with the rage</i>
<i>over his daughter's murder,</i>

28:10.864 --> 28:13.099
instilled with
the religious doctrine...

28:13.166 --> 28:16.102
that anyone who takes
an innocent life...

28:16.169 --> 28:19.072
must forfeit <i>his</i> life,

28:19.139 --> 28:21.908
<i>it becomes easy to see</i>
<i>why Gerald Braun...</i>

28:21.975 --> 28:27.748
<i>was so impassioned</i>
<i>to believe he was right.</i>

28:28.715 --> 28:30.851
He went to his own rabbi,

28:30.917 --> 28:32.919
<i>who compounded</i>
<i>this passion...</i>

28:32.986 --> 28:38.159
by saying it was more moral
for Ronald Martin
to be dead than free.

28:38.225 --> 28:41.195
In the mixture of this
religious influence...

28:41.262 --> 28:44.665
<i>and his own rage</i>
<i>and religious pain,</i>

28:44.731 --> 28:47.668
<i>he marched toward</i>
<i>Ronald Martin with</i>
<i>a loaded gun in his hand.</i>

28:47.735 --> 28:51.505
And with each step,
as he got closer
and closer to the man...

28:51.572 --> 28:54.141
who choked the life
out of his only daughter,

28:54.208 --> 28:57.779
he waited for the impulse
to tell him, "Stop!"

29:00.181 --> 29:02.216
Instead,

29:04.586 --> 29:09.224
he saw Donna's face.

29:11.826 --> 29:15.029
He heard the passages...

29:15.097 --> 29:18.166
from Exodus and Leviticus.

29:18.233 --> 29:22.170
"Eye for an eye."
"He who sheds the blood of man."

29:22.237 --> 29:25.007
"Vengeance is mine."
God said that.

29:25.073 --> 29:27.242
"Vengeance is mine!"

29:27.309 --> 29:31.446
And suddenly that night,
vengeance was Gerald Braun's.

29:31.513 --> 29:34.482
In the heat of moral
and religious passion,

29:34.549 --> 29:36.484
in the heat of horrible grief,

29:36.552 --> 29:40.589
vengeance became his.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.159
<i>Was he right?</i>

29:44.226 --> 29:46.562
No.

29:47.963 --> 29:52.335
Does this man
belong in prison?

29:52.401 --> 29:55.271
<i>Of course not.</i>

29:55.338 --> 29:57.906
For whatever reason,
Gerald Braun felt...

29:57.973 --> 30:02.545
he was in God's hands
that night.

30:04.313 --> 30:07.283
But there's no doubt,
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

30:09.252 --> 30:11.187

30:13.089 --> 30:15.591
he's now in yours.

30:34.344 --> 30:37.214
I ask not that you abandon
your compassion for this man.

30:37.281 --> 30:41.318
<i>I ask simply that</i>
<i>you not be blinded by it.</i>

30:41.385 --> 30:44.989
<i>We could pass a law</i>
<i>permitting parents...</i>

30:45.055 --> 30:47.724
to avenge the deaths
of their murdered children.

30:47.791 --> 30:51.095
We choose not to.

30:51.161 --> 30:53.964
We could pass a law
permitting religion...

30:54.031 --> 30:56.400
to be an excuse
for certain types
of homicides.

30:56.466 --> 30:58.268
We choose not to.

30:58.335 --> 31:00.537
We could live in a society...

31:00.605 --> 31:03.440
that considers revenge murder
to be moral.

31:03.508 --> 31:05.776
We choose not to.

31:05.843 --> 31:08.312
Now, this man
by his own admission...

31:08.379 --> 31:12.617
knowingly and reflectively
executed another human being.

31:12.683 --> 31:16.354
<i>You heard that defendant</i>
<i>accuse me...</i>

31:16.421 --> 31:21.992
of being here both as a rabbi
and a district attorney.

31:22.060 --> 31:24.929
In truth,
I am here threefold--

31:24.996 --> 31:29.901
a lawyer, a rabbi
and a man.

31:29.968 --> 31:33.004
And when he suggests
to this jury...

31:33.071 --> 31:36.174
<i>that you ignore</i>
<i>the clear intent of law,</i>

31:36.241 --> 31:40.846
<i>he offends my sensibilities</i>
<i>as a district attorney.</i>

31:40.912 --> 31:43.582
And when he champions...

31:43.649 --> 31:47.586
revenge murder as being
in keeping with Judaism,

31:47.653 --> 31:49.655
he offends me as a rabbi!

31:49.721 --> 31:51.990
<i>And when he claims that...</i>

31:52.057 --> 31:54.059
what he did was moral,

31:54.125 --> 31:57.763
he offends morality itself.

31:57.829 --> 32:01.667
And I take it personally
as a man!

32:05.204 --> 32:08.207
It will be a great insult
to human nature...

32:08.274 --> 32:10.442
not to understand
why he did this,

32:10.509 --> 32:15.247
but it is an even
greater outrage to mankind
to tolerate it.

32:17.216 --> 32:19.786
Any and every trial...

32:19.852 --> 32:22.521
ultimately...

32:22.588 --> 32:24.891
becomes about...

32:24.957 --> 32:27.727
the truth.

32:27.794 --> 32:29.629
And the truth...

32:29.696 --> 32:33.633
which each and
every one of you swore to...

32:37.270 --> 32:40.473
was to uphold the law.

33:01.661 --> 33:06.700
You are proposing instead
of Mr. Piper going to jail
for statutory rape,

33:06.767 --> 33:11.038
he should be allowed to go free
so he can marry the victim?

33:11.104 --> 33:14.374
Uh, Your Honor,
I would ask you
to consider the following--

33:14.442 --> 33:16.477
I won't consider anything
that escapes your mouth,
counselor.

33:16.544 --> 33:20.180
You're here representing him.
I'm more concerned about her.

33:20.247 --> 33:22.416
She's 14 years old,
for God's sake.

33:22.483 --> 33:24.585
Which is why
I've brought Cindy McGuire
from Child Welfare.

33:24.652 --> 33:28.289
[ Sighs ]
You're recommending this?

33:28.356 --> 33:30.591
The idea makes me nauseous,

33:30.658 --> 33:33.261
but my concern is for
the girl and for the baby.

33:33.327 --> 33:36.898
- And?
- This man seems able
to provide a home.

33:36.965 --> 33:40.601
If he goes to jail, we're
likely looking at a foster home
for the child. Plus--

33:40.668 --> 33:43.504
- What about the grandmother?
- Well, then we're
looking at welfare.

33:43.571 --> 33:46.140
She can't afford
to take care of a baby.

33:46.207 --> 33:48.877
With all due respect
to my bias, Your Honor,
this isn't unprecedented.

33:48.943 --> 33:52.246
These kinds of marriages
have been recommended
before with minors...

33:52.313 --> 33:55.484
when the sex is consensual,
both partners
are committed to marriage,

33:55.550 --> 33:59.053
and the father is the only
real means of financial support.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.955
That's what we've got here.

34:01.022 --> 34:04.259
That doesn't make it
any less putrid.

34:04.326 --> 34:07.128
What the hell kind of message
does this send?

34:07.196 --> 34:11.300
You can commit statutory rape
so long as you marry
the child after?

34:11.366 --> 34:14.636
<i>Okay, look.</i>
<i>There are a hundred reasons</i>
<i>to condemn the idea.</i>

34:14.703 --> 34:18.540
But the fact is,
I'm not here to send
a message to society.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.876
I've got a pregnant
14-year-old girl.

34:20.943 --> 34:23.645
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>
<i>what's best for her,</i>

34:23.712 --> 34:26.148
what's best for
this one particular baby.

34:26.215 --> 34:29.583
My recommendation is that
you give them a chance.

34:32.154 --> 34:35.257

34:35.324 --> 34:38.127
My daughter wants to, uh,
raise her child, Your Honor.

34:38.193 --> 34:40.362
She wants her baby
to have a father.

34:40.429 --> 34:44.333
<i>And they love each other.</i>

34:44.400 --> 34:47.036

I'm going to accept
Miss McGuire's recommendation...

Bailiff?

35:31.415 --> 35:33.650
The jury has come back
with a question.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.653
They want to know
if manslaughter is an option,

35:36.720 --> 35:40.624
which means that
they don't want to find him
guilty of murder.

35:40.691 --> 35:43.560
<i>But nor do they want</i>
<i>to see him walk free.</i>

35:43.627 --> 35:47.431
Now, which prospect
they dislike more,
that's anybody's guess.

35:51.836 --> 35:54.305
So who's gonna blink?

36:01.513 --> 36:05.717
I would be open to
a plea bargain for manslaughter.

36:08.152 --> 36:10.121
No.

36:10.187 --> 36:14.392
If they come back guilty,
you are going away

most of all of it suspended.
