WEBVTT

00:01.890 --> 00:04.190
- Yo what's up everybody, how you doing?

00:04.190 --> 00:07.300
This is Lucky in the house
representing "Chimera House."

00:07.300 --> 00:08.160
Yeah!

00:08.160 --> 00:09.327
Yo, check it out, I'm the number one

00:09.327 --> 00:11.750
"Boricua Talk Show" host in town,

00:11.750 --> 00:13.260
and we got some of my peeps back there

00:13.260 --> 00:14.480
and they want to talk to you all

00:14.480 --> 00:15.870
about what's really going on

00:15.870 --> 00:18.030
because frankly you don't
know what's going on.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.060
So check it out.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.740
Yeah, let's see you,
how's everybody feeling?

00:20.740 --> 00:22.263
- Feeling good, Lucky!

00:23.584 --> 00:24.740
Let's start off with my boy.

00:24.740 --> 00:26.630
He's howling like a dog in heat

00:26.630 --> 00:28.038
like he is, you know what I'm saying?

00:28.038 --> 00:28.871
- That's right man.

00:28.871 --> 00:30.127
Bones, my man Praxedias

00:31.221 --> 00:32.572
what's up, man

00:32.572 --> 00:34.330
- Puerto Rico!

00:34.330 --> 00:35.420
Yo, tell the world, man,

00:35.420 --> 00:36.580
the world don't know stuff about us.

00:36.580 --> 00:37.730
Tell them about
- The world, man

00:37.730 --> 00:38.563
- your world, man.

00:38.563 --> 00:40.740
- The world, there's two worlds,
talking about two worlds.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.470
My world, our world.

00:42.470 --> 00:44.175
And then there's the other world.

00:58.130 --> 00:59.140
How you doing girl?

00:59.140 --> 01:00.020
You know, you're so sexy, man.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.350
I think one day you and
me should get together.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.410
- Drop it, Lucky.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.650
I think we
should you know what I mean

01:04.650 --> 01:05.643
- Lucky, drop it now.

01:05.643 --> 01:06.609
All right!

01:06.609 --> 01:08.368
Ew, look at that guy!

01:08.368 --> 01:09.201
Ew!

01:12.347 --> 01:13.680
Oh, man!

01:14.638 --> 01:15.748
- Look at him!

01:52.105 --> 01:57.105
to be taken for a ride

02:18.501 --> 02:23.501
the mystery of Highway 40

02:32.299 --> 02:37.299
that drives the hearse

02:39.328 --> 02:43.705
is never in remission

02:43.705 --> 02:48.705
it's just another curse

02:55.473 --> 02:59.753
following a star

03:26.020 --> 03:27.680
- Good afternoon, everyone.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.850
Good afternoon, Dee.

03:29.850 --> 03:33.000
- I'd like to welcome our
new resident to the family.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.610
Roy, I'm looking forward
to working with you,

03:35.610 --> 03:38.540
and I hope we can make a
real difference in your life.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.979
Thank you family.

03:39.979 --> 03:41.896
Thank you, Dee.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.090
- All right, listen up.

03:45.210 --> 03:46.840
Now that we're on summer break,

03:46.840 --> 03:49.490
we have lots of work to do to
get the house back in shape.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.130
Remember, this is your home.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.430
So give it the love and
attention it deserves.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.423
Any questions about chores?

03:59.080 --> 04:00.310
Then let's get to it.

04:00.310 --> 04:03.361
Monica and Theresa can
adjourn, thank you family.

04:03.361 --> 04:05.014
- Thank you, Daryl.

04:33.710 --> 04:34.823
- Checking on chores.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.290
It's no good, do it over.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.740
- What are you talking about?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.920
- It's not good enough.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.300
Daryl likes things to sparkle.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.463
- Yeah, well things are sparkling.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.520
- That ain't acceptable, man.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.750
- Nobody can see under there.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.583
- I can.

04:58.650 --> 05:00.350
- So who are you?

05:00.350 --> 05:03.040
- I'm the DM, your discipline monitor.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.100
That means you obey my reasonable requests

05:05.100 --> 05:07.150
or I can give you consequences.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.417
- That's bullshit.

05:11.390 --> 05:12.540
- That's bullshit, huh?

05:13.690 --> 05:15.090
Disrespecting peer authority

05:15.950 --> 05:18.470
Failure to follow staff direction,

05:18.470 --> 05:21.509
provoking attitude, foul language.

05:21.509 --> 05:23.290
Get the idea?

05:23.290 --> 05:24.190
- That's fucked up

05:25.421 --> 05:26.588
- That's life.

05:27.475 --> 05:29.475
Get back to work.

06:25.550 --> 06:28.410
- Roy, what are you doing out here?

06:28.410 --> 06:30.480
- I just needed some space.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.983
- You didn't ask permission.

06:33.450 --> 06:35.580
- I need permission to
sit in the backyard?

06:35.580 --> 06:37.280
- Until you knew our system,

06:37.280 --> 06:40.030
you'd better ask
permission for everything.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.580
And never go outside without Dee

06:41.580 --> 06:43.440
or me knowing where you are.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.280
Otherwise it's an AWOL contract

06:45.280 --> 06:46.980
and threatens your placement.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.800
Do you understand?

06:48.800 --> 06:49.633
- Look, I just needed-

06:49.633 --> 06:51.330
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

06:55.010 --> 06:55.843
- Yeah.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.450
Fuck this place.

07:07.450 --> 07:08.290
- What happened?

07:08.290 --> 07:09.720
.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.520
He treats me like a two year old.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.590
- He's into power tripping, all right.

07:13.590 --> 07:14.423
But what do you expect

07:14.423 --> 07:16.600
when the guy was in 'Nam for 10 years?

07:16.600 --> 07:18.800
- Yeah, well not one
of his stupid soldiers.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.813
- You're gonna have to get used to it.

07:22.711 --> 07:24.970
I mean, he's not such a bad
guy once you get to know him

07:26.430 --> 07:27.310
- I don't want to get to know him.

07:27.310 --> 07:29.260
I just want to get the fuck outta here.

07:30.370 --> 07:31.673
- Don't think like that, man.

07:31.673 --> 07:34.340
It's gonna make time go much slower.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.430
- And what's his trip anyway?

07:36.430 --> 07:38.090
- Well, you see, I heard
that he was a real screw up

07:38.090 --> 07:39.380
until he joined the army,

07:39.380 --> 07:41.230
then he learned all
about rules, discipline,

07:41.230 --> 07:42.541
and shit like that.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.010
You know, got his act together.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.920
I guess he thinks it's
gonna work for us too.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.803
- So he wants to save our souls.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.010
- Hey, you know, it could be a lot worse.

07:52.010 --> 07:54.310
At least the guy's heart's
in the right place.

07:55.690 --> 07:58.173
- Failure to follow staff directions,

07:59.420 --> 08:03.353
throwing an object, and
having a negative attitude.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.340
What's up Keisha, what happened?

08:10.130 --> 08:13.138
- I got some bad news about my son.

08:13.138 --> 08:14.020
He all right?

08:14.020 --> 08:15.940
- Well, my sister gone moved to Texas

08:15.940 --> 08:17.650
and she taken Ricky with her.

08:17.650 --> 08:20.253
I'm not going to see my
baby for a long time.

08:21.140 --> 08:21.973
Sorry.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.720
Look, Keisha what's going
to be your retribution?

08:26.720 --> 08:27.553
- I don't care.

08:27.553 --> 08:30.500
Dishes, hallways, windows, whatever.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.888
Do we agree?

08:31.888 --> 08:33.080
Yeah, it's cool.

08:33.080 --> 08:33.913
- Roy.

08:34.870 --> 08:39.870
Noncompliance of structure,
failure to complete chores,

08:40.620 --> 08:42.850
disrespecting peer authority.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.800
You know how the system works?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.582
- I told him all about it.

08:46.582 --> 08:48.523
- You got to choose
your own punishment man.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.070
- Well, I didn't do anything wrong.

08:51.070 --> 08:53.550
- Ain't no fighting the bookings,
just choose your chores.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.200
- But I didn't do anything wrong.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.150
- Are you refusing to
abide by family rules?

08:58.150 --> 09:00.780
- I'm refusing to say
I'm guilty when I'm not.

09:00.780 --> 09:03.430
- You wouldn't be here
unless you were guilty.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.550
That's not what this is about.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.760
Either you're a member of
this family or you're not.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.211
- That's a joke.

09:14.740 --> 09:15.950
- Do you want to go back to the hall?

09:15.950 --> 09:17.420
- Oh, so that's my choice?

09:17.420 --> 09:19.710
Roll over and kiss your
ass, or go back to the hall?

09:19.710 --> 09:20.860
- Go to your room, Roy.

09:22.670 --> 09:24.310
Go.

09:24.310 --> 09:25.810
Take some time, cool down.

09:37.830 --> 09:38.880
Fool's crazy.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.353
- Can I talk to you?

09:51.130 --> 09:52.340
- Come in.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.410
- Close the door.

09:58.852 --> 10:01.410
- Oh I can't, it's against the rules.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.110
But I have permission to be here.

10:03.110 --> 10:05.560
I'm supposed to represent
you at your initiation.

10:06.570 --> 10:07.403
- What?

10:07.403 --> 10:08.670
- They're going to have an initiation

10:08.670 --> 10:10.890
to see if you're
appropriate for this house,

10:10.890 --> 10:12.890
and I've volunteered to be your support.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.200
See, what happens is
they have this big dinner

10:18.200 --> 10:21.090
and while everyone eats asks
you a bunch of questions.

10:21.090 --> 10:22.270
It's kind of like a trial, you know,

10:22.270 --> 10:23.840
to see if you'll fit into our family.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.820
And we call it the initiation.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.330
- Yeah and what if I don't want to do it?

10:27.330 --> 10:29.330
- Well, you don't have a choice.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.973
What happens?

10:30.973 --> 10:32.712
- Then you won't be able to stay.

10:40.956 --> 10:42.927
- Yeah, I'll show you guys
how to barbecue, all right?

10:42.927 --> 10:45.323
This is what separates
the men from the boys.

10:46.156 --> 10:47.054
- What're you talking about?

10:47.054 --> 10:49.000
- I've had all kind of
picnics at the house Daryl.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.860
I didn't flip major meat.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.435
He said major meat, you hear that?

10:53.268 --> 10:55.030
- I am not talking about a picnic here.

10:55.030 --> 10:55.870
I'm talking about a barbecue.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.333
- I'll tell you what I
let you listen to a man.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.670
I'll show you how to really barbecue.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.410
- Look Lucky, it is not the time yet.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.380
Step away, let a real man
show you how it's done,

11:02.380 --> 11:03.300
thank you very much.

11:04.310 --> 11:05.260
- We know you, man,

11:07.397 --> 11:09.660
- Oh, no I can't take that.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.620
- Oh, ash on a bun, yum, yum.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.813
- This Mesquite, right?

11:14.450 --> 11:16.000
- I'm not dealing with E. Coli.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.290
- There you go, see?

11:18.290 --> 11:20.320
- Hey Laura, come here Laura.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.433
Ladies first.

11:21.433 --> 11:22.335
- Thanks.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.250
- Good evening family.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.330
Before we get started, I'd like to say

11:30.330 --> 11:32.290
a few words about the initiation.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.520
I want you all to remember

11:33.520 --> 11:35.540
what it was like when you went through it.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.740
You were new, you didn't know anybody.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.210
And suddenly you were put in a situation

11:40.210 --> 11:41.043
where you had to answer

11:41.043 --> 11:43.090
a lot of tough questions about yourselves.

11:46.310 --> 11:47.830
It took a lot of courage.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.180
So let's keep that in mind.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.710
- I got a question for you.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.110
Okay, here's the situation.

11:55.110 --> 11:58.790
Family Day, happens once
a month around here.

11:58.790 --> 12:02.070
As usual, my grandmother's
the first to arrive.

12:02.070 --> 12:03.960
Like she does every other time,

12:03.960 --> 12:05.450
she checks to make sure I'm not around,

12:05.450 --> 12:08.320
then she grabs whoever's first to walk by.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.707
Let's say it's your break time.

12:09.707 --> 12:11.900
And you're rushing, trying
to get out of the kitchen

12:11.900 --> 12:13.410
away from other work.

12:13.410 --> 12:16.470
But when you see her,
she won't let you go.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.410
Here's the challenge, Roy.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.870
This is what I want to know.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.140
Would you give up your break time,

12:20.140 --> 12:21.609
help her do what she wants?

12:22.540 --> 12:24.680
Or would you leave first chance you got?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.893
- I don't get it, what
does she want me to do?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.870
- She's my grandmother, Roy.

12:30.870 --> 12:33.730
If she wants your help, isn't that enough?

12:33.730 --> 12:34.563
- I don't know.

12:34.563 --> 12:36.360
She sounds pretty weird to me.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.193
Damn!

12:40.138 --> 12:41.488
- It's called respect, Roy.

12:42.559 --> 12:43.830
You ever heard of that?

12:43.830 --> 12:46.610
What if it was your family
and now disrespected them?

12:46.610 --> 12:48.290
Would that make a difference?

12:48.290 --> 12:49.700
- Let's just leave them out of it okay?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.520
- No, it's an important question.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.330
I want you to answer it.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.760
- Well, I don't think my
family is any of your business.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.380
- I think they are.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.080
Isn't he supposed to ask our questions?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.123
- Talking about our families
is part of the program, Roy.

13:03.030 --> 13:05.620
It's not easy, but you need to do it.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.070
- Come on, just tell them
what they want to hear.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.923
- This is bullshit, I'm not
gonna, I don't want to play.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.230
Please, Roy?

13:15.230 --> 13:18.000
- Ever heard the term,
image breaking, Roy?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.600
Is what they do in military boot camps,

13:20.600 --> 13:23.000
breaking down the recruits'
old civilian image

13:23.000 --> 13:25.290
and replacing it with a soldier.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.880
We do things a little
differently around here,

13:26.880 --> 13:30.040
but it's basically the same idea.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.637
Suddenly you have to
face up to who you are

13:31.637 --> 13:33.587
before we can change what doesn't work.

13:37.810 --> 13:39.810
Are you ready for a real challenge, Roy?

13:41.560 --> 13:44.648
Can I get a couple of
volunteers to get the mirror?

13:44.648 --> 13:45.481
- Me!

13:45.481 --> 13:47.455
- Aw, he's going to get it.

13:47.455 --> 13:48.288
- Oh, man.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.280
- Please stand facing the mirror.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.440
Straight in front, Roy.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.273
All right.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.860
Look at that person in the mirror.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.460
Can you tell us who he is?

14:19.150 --> 14:20.520
- He's Roy.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.260
- I can't hear you.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.360
- He's Roy.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.410
- Describe Roy to us.

14:28.510 --> 14:33.510
- He's got Brown hair, blue
eyes, white skin, some pimples.

14:35.340 --> 14:36.173
- That is good.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.350
That's who he is on the outside.

14:38.350 --> 14:40.893
Now, tell us who he is on the inside.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.093
- I don't know what you mean.

14:43.093 --> 14:44.530
- Look at him, Roy.

14:44.530 --> 14:45.980
You described his outer features,

14:45.980 --> 14:48.160
now describe his inner ones.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.733
Look into his eyes and
tell us what you see.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.433
- Nervous.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.680
- I can't hear you.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.220
- Nervous.
- What else?

15:04.890 --> 15:06.190
- I don't know.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.350
- Need some help?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.410
Can anyone to help Roy?

15:16.410 --> 15:17.243
- He's scared.

15:20.742 --> 15:23.243
- Well, if you agree
with her, then tell him.

15:29.030 --> 15:30.400
- You're scared.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.840
- Anything else?

15:31.840 --> 15:32.673
- He's angry.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.570
- You're angry.
- I can't hear you.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.830
- He's angry.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.260
- He be looking suspicious to me.

15:39.260 --> 15:40.550
- He suspicious.

15:40.550 --> 15:42.023
- He's courageous.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.810
- He's courageous.

15:45.810 --> 15:48.193
- He's just a wild and crazy guy.

15:51.982 --> 15:54.070
- He's a wild and crazy guy.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.430
- All right, good.

15:56.430 --> 15:58.180
Now that's what we expect from you

15:58.180 --> 15:59.480
while you live in this house

15:59.480 --> 16:01.523
straight up honesty, even if it's hard.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.050
- You got a minute.

16:39.050 --> 16:39.883
- Yeah.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.787
- I wanted to tell you something.

16:51.787 --> 16:54.210
You know the real reason I'm staying.

16:54.210 --> 16:55.213
It's because of you.

17:01.365 --> 17:03.282
- They are going to AA.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.938
All over to the AA.

17:14.938 --> 17:16.938
All over to the AA, now!

17:19.220 --> 17:22.690
- Want to continue some other time.

17:22.690 --> 17:25.540
- The next thing I remember,
I'm lying in a pool of blood.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.140
Mine in the back of an ambulance.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.690
Blood is pouring in my eyes and my mouth.

17:30.690 --> 17:32.440
I remember spitting up so much blood

17:32.440 --> 17:34.800
they keep telling me to knock it off.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.420
When I was sewn up in semi-auto shock

17:37.420 --> 17:41.300
I started screaming the pain
from having your face bashed

17:41.300 --> 17:43.240
and kicked in is brutal.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.620
And the morphine didn't help.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.890
Like any drug that wears off.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.640
I got up, I went into the bathroom

17:49.640 --> 17:52.670
in the mirror with some
months it looked like it came

17:52.670 --> 17:54.590
from a bad slasher flick.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.780
And that was the last day I drank.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.840
The DTS, the shakes, the itching,

17:58.840 --> 18:01.150
all at other and other story.

18:01.150 --> 18:02.070
But I'm telling you,

18:02.070 --> 18:05.870
it's such a tough gamble
to drink and do drugs.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.403
You always lose.

18:08.311 --> 18:10.210
And that's all I have to say.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.560
So I want to hear from you.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.290
What's your drug of choice?

18:14.290 --> 18:16.350
- I use crack a couple of times.

18:16.350 --> 18:17.560
I liked it.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.620
- Ecstasy.

18:18.620 --> 18:19.453
- Spirit.

18:19.453 --> 18:20.657
.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.970
- Marijuana's cool.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.210
- Sometimes I drink.

18:25.210 --> 18:26.830
- LSD.

18:26.830 --> 18:27.890
- All of them, man.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.268
I like them all.

18:32.513 --> 18:33.346
- You.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.400
- I like the bud because
it makes you laugh.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.410
Makes you happy and relaxed
and it doesn't turn you

18:40.410 --> 18:43.713
into an addict or a bad side
effects like those other drugs.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.920
- Yo, Steve man, that's not true.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.763
It makes me feel stupid and tired.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.573
- You are stupid and tired.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.320
- Why do you use LSD?

18:55.320 --> 18:57.730
- Cause LSD is the only
drug, that's not an escape.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.660
Makes you see things in a
new way without all the BS

19:01.740 --> 19:03.650
that expands your mind.

19:03.650 --> 19:05.490
- Do you mean it makes you crazy.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.180
That's why people would
be jumping out of windows.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.190
Thinking they could
fly like Jordan, maybe.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.237
Hell are we here?

19:12.070 --> 19:16.180
- All right, let's talk about
why people stopped using.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.110
Why did you quit?

19:17.110 --> 19:19.220
- I quit for my baby.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.053
- You?

19:20.053 --> 19:21.060
- Because I'm in here.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.660
And if we get caught, Daryl
will send us to the Hall.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.140
- You still want to use
after all that's happened?

19:26.140 --> 19:27.880
Haven't you learned
anything from this program?

19:27.880 --> 19:29.770
- Yeah, I learned from my mistake

19:29.770 --> 19:31.349
next time I won't get caught.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.040
- Wake up people.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.523
Come on don't you care?

19:37.530 --> 19:39.380
Don't you care about being locked up.

19:40.528 --> 19:42.428
Don't you care about the consequences.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.100
- I'll tell you what I care about.

19:50.171 --> 19:52.960
I was stuck in here and
all the drugs is out there.

20:03.723 --> 20:06.400
Don't piss like that cause you know fuck.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.570
- Dude, I got something I wanna tell you.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.403
- What?

20:10.403 --> 20:12.013
- Lets go to my room.

20:13.350 --> 20:16.250
I got inspired listening
to everyone in AA.

20:16.250 --> 20:19.330
I think I know how to get
some acid into the house.

20:19.330 --> 20:20.623
- How?
- Right there.

20:23.079 --> 20:24.890
No, no I mean it it's a carrier

20:24.890 --> 20:26.940
and it's ready to fly to my house

20:26.940 --> 20:29.370
and I can have my brother tie
some blotter paper to its leg

20:29.370 --> 20:31.040
and then it'll fly back here.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.330
Daryl is not gonna search a pigeon.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.163
- Are you serious?

20:34.163 --> 20:35.750
- Oh yeah.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.510
- Steve, you're a genius.

20:37.510 --> 20:38.343
Let's do it.

20:38.343 --> 20:39.560
- It'll take a few days to set it up,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.689
I have to call my brother first.

20:50.745 --> 20:53.340
- Hey can I talk to you for a minute?

20:53.340 --> 20:54.690
- Yeah, what about?

20:54.690 --> 20:58.010
- I want to spend some
time with Laura alone

20:58.010 --> 21:00.527
and I wanted to know if
you could help me out.

21:06.409 --> 21:09.076
- Anything with keeping in that.

21:14.350 --> 21:16.100
Are you going to have sex with her?

21:18.503 --> 21:20.683
- I don't know, maybe.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.403
- That is breaking a Cardinal rule.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.380
You just have no idea, do you?

21:26.380 --> 21:29.223
Daryl catches you and you're
gone, no questions asked.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.000
- Well, that's why I was asking you.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.050
I was hoping you could advise me on

21:34.050 --> 21:35.450
when and where it's safest.

21:35.450 --> 21:37.060
That sort of thing.

21:37.060 --> 21:41.370
- If I help you with this, if you allow me

21:42.370 --> 21:44.690
because that's the way
we do things around here

21:44.690 --> 21:47.343
all favors must be
returned, simple as that.

21:48.881 --> 21:50.131
We have an understanding?

21:51.550 --> 21:52.383
Do we?

21:53.740 --> 21:54.573
- Absolutely.

21:58.434 --> 21:59.820
- Come on.

21:59.820 --> 22:00.653
Keep it going

22:00.653 --> 22:02.930
cause I know you having
a great time out there

22:02.930 --> 22:06.240
and push it, push it and kick those feet.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.600
Little sweat, little burn
feel those calories dirt

22:08.600 --> 22:10.100
leaving that body there you go

22:10.100 --> 22:11.510
yeah keep going.

22:11.510 --> 22:12.648
Keep going.

22:12.648 --> 22:14.402
Single, single, double, double.

22:14.402 --> 22:15.990
Single, single, double, double.

22:15.990 --> 22:18.700
Wonderful, doing a great job out there.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.760
- Oh, come on now.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.164
Get into it, my God!

22:22.164 --> 22:23.960
Monica you more than
look better that you eat.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.457
- Come on Daryl, this is stupid.

22:26.457 --> 22:28.570
- And I wanna see you sweat.

22:28.570 --> 22:29.410
- You're a pervert.

22:29.410 --> 22:31.193
- Come on Praxedias, come on, pick it up.

22:31.193 --> 22:32.543
Show some guts.

22:33.376 --> 22:35.415
To the left,
to the right, to the right.

22:35.415 --> 22:37.509
Now double, let's go.

22:56.823 --> 22:59.574
- What d'you got man, show me something,

22:59.574 --> 23:01.692
show me something baby.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.042
- Tell them my man

23:27.423 --> 23:29.150
show some guts baby.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.217
Show some boom.

23:30.217 --> 23:32.300
Boom, boom, boom.

23:51.213 --> 23:53.213
- You look so beautiful.

23:54.174 --> 23:56.081
Do you know how much I like you?

23:56.081 --> 23:57.248
- No, tell me.

24:05.846 --> 24:07.267
Ah.

24:07.267 --> 24:10.574
- Miss your shot baby, I told you.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.574
Whatever Lucky.

24:25.150 --> 24:25.983
Amateur.

24:39.324 --> 24:40.810
- I see what you got.
- Here we go.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.157
- I bet you will make it.

24:42.157 --> 24:42.990
I bet you'll make it.

24:42.990 --> 24:45.490
- Hey champ you've seen Roy or Laura?

24:45.490 --> 24:46.323
- Nope.

24:47.870 --> 24:49.550
- I think Roy is in the bathroom.

24:49.550 --> 24:50.600
I haven't seen Laura.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.040
- Come on we really got to go.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.120
- Hold on a minute.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.710
- We can get caught, if we don't go now.

25:09.580 --> 25:13.098
- Don't worry, Lucky will
warn us if there's a problem.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.853
- Daryl, just the man I wanted to see,

25:18.853 --> 25:20.420
I wanna talk with you
about something Daryl.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.990
I mean you look like
kind of stress out to me.

25:21.990 --> 25:22.950
You know what I mean?

25:22.950 --> 25:24.280
Just any trouble you
wanna talk about with me?

25:24.280 --> 25:25.806
You look a little messed up, man.

25:25.806 --> 25:26.639
You know what I'm saying?

25:26.639 --> 25:28.440
No, I mean, I mean you
look really sufficient

25:28.440 --> 25:30.360
and Daryl these clothes, huh?

25:31.875 --> 25:33.030
No wonder you feel blue?

25:33.030 --> 25:34.690
Take a look at bones over there, huh?

25:34.690 --> 25:36.002
Daryl look at them, huh?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.740
Daryl, please take a look at them.

25:37.740 --> 25:41.530
Now look, there's a man who
takes pride in his image.

25:41.530 --> 25:43.250
Bones, get over here.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.150
Bones move your ass and get over here.

25:46.760 --> 25:47.593
Look at him.

25:47.593 --> 25:48.480
Look how cool is when he starts over here

25:48.480 --> 25:50.390
knowing he's top dog, huh?

25:50.390 --> 25:51.490
There's no telling how far

25:51.490 --> 25:52.770
this one is going to make
it in the world though.

25:52.770 --> 25:55.151
But no, let me help you with
something here, okay, watch.

25:55.151 --> 25:57.290
express your love.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.123
How's that?

26:00.512 --> 26:02.657
That's the real him,
that's the real you, man.

26:02.657 --> 26:04.495
Now you go boy, huh?

26:18.625 --> 26:21.422
Daryl, I just remembered,

26:21.422 --> 26:25.807
Roy said that he wasn't
feeling well, to his room.

26:32.201 --> 26:34.758
- Hi, Daryl?

26:50.430 --> 26:52.280
- What's going on here Roy?

26:52.280 --> 26:56.713
- I was hot and I wanted
to change my clothes.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.370
I think I have a fever.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.833
I'm not feeling too well.

27:02.940 --> 27:04.840
- I'm not going to warn you again.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.700
You need permission to
leave group activities.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.470
And if you're feeling sick,
let Dee and myself know.

27:10.470 --> 27:12.340
We'll get you the meds.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.540
Either way you're on room restriction

27:13.540 --> 27:14.740
for the rest of the day.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.333
- Shit, man.

27:23.210 --> 27:25.261
What the hell are you thinking of, huh?

27:25.261 --> 27:26.822
You can't be taking so much time.

27:26.822 --> 27:27.822
- I'm sorry.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.840
- I saved your ass, remember that, okay?

27:30.840 --> 27:31.673
You owe me.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.816
You owe me, remember.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.070
We're out here waiting
on you Chimera House punks.

28:08.070 --> 28:12.720
Wake up, wake up, wake
up, hello time to be man.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.340
Wake up bitch,

28:16.650 --> 28:18.697
Well, let's

28:23.487 --> 28:25.023
- Edge wood punks.

28:26.220 --> 28:27.870
One of the damn group home.

28:27.870 --> 28:32.240

28:32.240 --> 28:34.037
I can't do nothing about it.

28:34.037 --> 28:37.787
Come out, what
are you so scared of.

28:38.781 --> 28:39.930
- I swear, man.

28:39.930 --> 28:40.780
I swear, man.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.130
I'm going to come back
and get the out these shit

28:42.130 --> 28:43.992
after I graduate, I swear to God.

28:43.992 --> 28:45.325
I'm gonna do it.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.970
- All right.

28:53.970 --> 28:55.463
Next order of business.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.680
I'm going to give Roy a chance

29:00.680 --> 29:02.823
to show his commitment to our program.

29:04.460 --> 29:08.563
I'm assigning him to be DM
while Kevin's away on pass.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.120
I want all of you, and
I do mean all of you

29:15.620 --> 29:18.253
to give him the support
he needs to do a good job.

29:25.381 --> 29:26.381
please come.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.513
All right.

29:32.670 --> 29:33.503
So let's do our chores

29:33.503 --> 29:35.820
so we can get out and enjoy the holiday.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.750
Happy 4th of July, family.

29:37.750 --> 29:40.960
Happy 4th of July, Daryl.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.570
- Thank you.

29:42.570 --> 29:43.470
They're all yours.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.270
- Teresa, scrub the sink.

29:51.270 --> 29:56.030
Monica windows, Praxedias bathrooms,

29:56.030 --> 29:57.800
Minh clean up the lounge.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.290
Lucky mop the kitchen floor.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.550
And Steve sweep the floors.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.610
- You sure you got that right, Roy?

30:03.610 --> 30:04.890
I don't do bathrooms.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.760
- Twist my ankle yesterday,
can't clean the lounge.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.700
- Monica and I always
worked together, Roy.

30:10.700 --> 30:13.640
- I don't do kitchens
hallways or floors either

30:13.640 --> 30:15.190
strictly now doorman, okay?

30:15.190 --> 30:16.920
- It's not fair you make me do windows.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.243
I'm too small.

30:20.490 --> 30:22.150
- All right, house meeting's over.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.253
Let's get to work.

30:27.030 --> 30:27.863
- Roy?

30:30.098 --> 30:32.290
You're taking job too serious, okay?

30:32.290 --> 30:34.183
You don't know how things work here yet.

31:06.570 --> 31:10.623
- Minh, what the hell are you doing?

31:11.920 --> 31:12.753
- What?

31:12.753 --> 31:14.400
- Why aren't you doing your chores?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.320
- I told you, man, I twisted my ankle.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.610
- Did you clear with Daryl?

31:17.610 --> 31:19.743
- Nah, man you're the DM, I'm telling you.

31:20.741 --> 31:22.230
- I'm giving you consequences.

31:22.230 --> 31:23.253
- I don't think so.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.950
I thought you'd be
missing your masterpiece.

31:29.750 --> 31:30.650
- Give that to me.

31:33.820 --> 31:34.710
Where'd you get that?

31:34.710 --> 31:36.390
- Fineness keeper.

31:36.390 --> 31:37.890
- You better give that to me, Minh.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.333
- I was thinking, Daryl
might like to see it.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.360
- What do you want for it?

31:42.360 --> 31:43.960
- Do my chores for a week.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.340
- Fine, now give it to me.

31:45.340 --> 31:48.900
- I'm going to keep it, but
I promise not to show Daryl.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.599
- If you do, I will beat
the shit out of you.

31:51.599 --> 31:53.099
- Get out of my room, asshole.

31:55.470 --> 31:56.970
Attention to everybody.

31:56.970 --> 31:59.610
The holiday excursion
leaves in a few minutes

31:59.610 --> 32:01.990
bring all your stuff and
meet me in the lounge.

32:01.990 --> 32:02.962
Thank you.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.913
- I'm so much fun.

32:09.913 --> 32:11.428
- You know what Monica?

32:44.519 --> 32:45.627
- Quiet!

33:08.530 --> 33:11.613
- See, this is my stepdad
and that's my uncle.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.420
And this is Lily, the little
girl I used to babysit for.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.726
Isn't she cute?

33:16.726 --> 33:18.020
- Yeah.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.990
- And this is Arnold, my neighbor's dog.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.240
Isn't that weird looking?

33:22.110 --> 33:23.570
- Yeah.

33:23.570 --> 33:25.270
- And this is where I live.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.620
It's really boring, I
have to drive everywhere.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.010
- What are they?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.736
- They're just messed up.

33:33.736 --> 33:34.686
- Come on, show me.

33:35.530 --> 33:37.413
- Not, just not now.

33:37.413 --> 33:38.246
- Okay, I thought we weren't

33:38.246 --> 33:39.210
going to keep secrets from each other.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.873
- They're not secret is
I'm just embarrassed.

33:43.175 --> 33:44.300
- How come?

33:44.300 --> 33:46.163
- Just cause they're just stupid.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.960
- Like why are you making
such a big deal out of this

33:48.960 --> 33:49.793
just show me.

33:49.793 --> 33:52.193
- No, do you want to see some others?

33:54.020 --> 33:55.742
- Everybody ready to go?

33:55.742 --> 33:56.825
Yeah.

33:59.293 --> 34:01.290
- Dee, can I bring a video camera please?

34:01.290 --> 34:02.916
- If you're responsible for it.

34:07.662 --> 34:08.580
- Oh, Tamara house what's up.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.650
We had a picnic here and we
got ducks in the place, oh.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.760
What's really going on, huh?

34:12.760 --> 34:16.022
Look at the scenery, check
this house, pretty bird, wow.

34:16.022 --> 34:17.610
This is where she'd be like all the time.

34:17.610 --> 34:18.687
You know, that's my boys and my aunts

34:18.687 --> 34:21.437
and so my girls they're
eating, having a good old time.

34:22.980 --> 34:25.130
Yo Prax it's a good sandwich, man.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.820
How about letting me have a bite?

34:26.820 --> 34:28.858
Give me a bite, I want to get.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.853
you're a slob, man.

34:30.853 --> 34:34.670
- This is the most festive
sandwich known to man.

34:34.670 --> 34:35.503
- Okay.

34:38.205 --> 34:39.310
What the hell is that?

34:39.310 --> 34:40.351
Oh no.

34:40.351 --> 34:41.204
It look like a crab.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.960
That's some
nasty shit, look at that.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.720
- How much are you going
to give me if eat this?

34:44.720 --> 34:46.145
Nothing.

34:46.145 --> 34:49.302
- Mm.

34:53.406 --> 34:55.280
Get away!

34:55.280 --> 34:58.620
- Guys slob is good,
Lucky you want it Steve!

34:59.650 --> 35:03.480
- I think the chips have
given me food poisoning

35:03.480 --> 35:06.110
but it's kind of a neat feeling.

35:06.110 --> 35:08.213
- I could really go for a sandwich.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
That'll do.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.053
- I can go for two Senyoritas too.

35:16.186 --> 35:18.743
Man, well what can I do now, huh?

35:21.060 --> 35:22.365
Dude!

35:22.365 --> 35:24.012
You didn't see me man, you didn't see me.

35:25.660 --> 35:27.483
Oh shot, what's this?

35:28.628 --> 35:29.800
A little secret
romance coming here.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.731
Roy, what do you think?

35:33.260 --> 35:34.764
Go Roy.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.740
- So when are you supposed to graduate?

35:38.740 --> 35:40.040
- In a few weeks, I think.

35:41.030 --> 35:42.420
- Really, that soon.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.323
- Yeah, I've been here for 10 months.

35:46.429 --> 35:47.960
- You're going to live at home.

35:47.960 --> 35:48.793
- I hope not.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.440
- How come, cause of your dad?

35:51.440 --> 35:53.175
- No, my stepdad.

35:54.010 --> 35:56.327
- You know, when I was
little my dad used to take me

35:56.327 --> 35:58.790
to this little cabin in the Sierras

36:00.210 --> 36:01.410
and we'd have to hike a few miles

36:01.410 --> 36:02.760
from the road to get to it.

36:03.910 --> 36:05.910
But there was never anybody else around.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.110
I mean, it was, it was incredible.

36:11.110 --> 36:16.110
I mean, there was a stream
and trees and lots of deer

36:20.400 --> 36:22.963
and we would just stay there for days.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.203
Fish or just hang out.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.190
Well sometimes when things get really bad

36:32.190 --> 36:33.790
I think about going there again.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.453
It makes me feel better
just thinking about it.

36:40.253 --> 36:41.903
- I wish I had a place like that.

36:47.230 --> 36:49.280
- You can share mine with me if you want.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.620
- So I guess I won't be seeing much of you

36:52.620 --> 36:53.683
for awhile, Lucky.

36:54.860 --> 36:56.080
- Why that baby?

36:56.080 --> 36:57.520
You got another man?

36:57.520 --> 36:59.216
- You never quit.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.560
You know, I am proud of you though

37:00.560 --> 37:03.020
for starting this new job tomorrow.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.730
I just hope you stick with it long enough

37:04.730 --> 37:06.100
to learn something.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.470
- Yeah.

37:07.470 --> 37:09.410
Yeah, I like working on cars.

37:09.410 --> 37:11.910
I got a lot of experience
from stealing them.

37:11.910 --> 37:14.770
- Lucky, this could be your big break.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.060
Don't go out there and blow it.

37:17.060 --> 37:17.893
- No, not me.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.540
I know a good thing when I see it.

37:20.540 --> 37:21.483
- I hope so.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.270
Lucky, would you run over there

37:27.270 --> 37:29.730
and tell Roy and Laura
to turn it to her hand.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.473
They've gone way too far.

37:37.530 --> 37:38.363
- Come on.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.220
It's beautiful, huh?

37:56.260 --> 37:57.093
- You fool?

37:59.219 --> 38:00.052
Hey you.

38:03.079 --> 38:03.912
- Hey!

38:05.019 --> 38:05.852
- Yo!

38:07.184 --> 38:08.403
- Hey, what's up.

38:08.403 --> 38:09.936
- Hey!

38:09.936 --> 38:10.769
- Hey!

38:11.647 --> 38:12.655
Hey you.

38:12.655 --> 38:13.655
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:14.632 --> 38:16.192
Hey.

38:16.192 --> 38:17.275
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:18.652 --> 38:19.547
Hey!

38:28.155 --> 38:29.507
Steve come on.

39:14.022 --> 39:16.501
- Take it, take it take my spray.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.265
- Get out, get out of here!

39:27.966 --> 39:30.509
- Get away from me, get away from me.

39:30.509 --> 39:32.360
away from
her, you piece of shit.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
- What's wrong with you?

39:33.360 --> 39:34.630
- Stay away from her.

39:34.630 --> 39:35.890
- Hit me asshole, hit me.

39:35.890 --> 39:36.723
- Yo!

39:37.746 --> 39:39.230
- Don't you ever touch her.

39:39.230 --> 39:40.593
- Come on, hit me asshole.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.838
- Stop it guys, stop it.

39:43.838 --> 39:45.686
- Come on, hit me coward, just hit me.

39:45.686 --> 39:47.460
Stop it guys, stop it.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.293
- Well, are you scared.

39:48.293 --> 39:49.126
Why are you scared?

39:49.126 --> 39:50.720
- All right.
- You're scared?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.930
Take some space, step back.

39:52.930 --> 39:56.090
- Hit me, coward.
- Get in the van, Roy.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.050
Did you hear what I said?

39:57.050 --> 39:57.883
Get in the van.

39:57.883 --> 39:59.160
Let's go.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.170
- Better go you asshole, better go.

40:20.130 --> 40:22.270
- You have some explaining to do, Roy.

40:22.270 --> 40:24.150
I need to know if you and
Laura having a relationship

40:24.150 --> 40:25.950
and I want you to tell me the truth.

40:25.950 --> 40:26.900
- What do you mean?

40:28.270 --> 40:32.190
We talk sometimes like nothing's going on.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.690
- And how do you explain this?

40:35.690 --> 40:38.080
- It's a drawing, it's just a fantasy.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.060
- You are really pushing my buttons.

40:40.060 --> 40:41.770
This isn't a game we're playing here, Boy.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.650
Either you work on our program
and follow all our rules

40:43.650 --> 40:46.000
or there's no point in you being here.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.280
And if I catch you anywhere
near Laura in the next few days,

40:48.280 --> 40:49.420
you'll be back on the hall so fast

40:49.420 --> 40:51.853
and make your head spin, try me.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.020
And I'm confiscating this.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.883
You're room restricted
until further notice.

41:36.370 --> 41:38.410
Laura, come to the staff office,

41:38.410 --> 41:40.737
Laura to the staff office.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.093
Come in.

41:48.728 --> 41:49.630
- You want to see me.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.220
- We have some good news for you, Laura.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.140
Daryl and I have picked a
date for your graduation.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.600
- When?

41:56.600 --> 41:57.880
- This coming Sunday.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.440
- In three days?

41:59.440 --> 42:00.590
- We've talked to your dad.

42:00.590 --> 42:02.040
He's all for it.

42:02.040 --> 42:04.060
Congratulations, Laura.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.480
- I don't think I'm ready.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.697
- You don't want to graduate?

42:06.697 --> 42:08.011
- No, I'm not ready yet.

42:08.011 --> 42:10.010
I just want to stay a few more months.

42:10.010 --> 42:12.320
- I know you're scared Laura

42:12.320 --> 42:15.830
but you've been at Chimera
House for 10 months now.

42:15.830 --> 42:18.220
It's time to move on with your life.

42:18.220 --> 42:19.730
- I'm not ready.

42:19.730 --> 42:21.230
- Laura, you're just anxious.

42:21.230 --> 42:22.320
Everyone gets nervous

42:22.320 --> 42:24.153
when there's big changes in their life.

42:27.770 --> 42:28.670
Have a seat Laura.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.970
Laura, I'm going to try
something to get you to relax.

42:37.970 --> 42:38.803
All right?

42:41.760 --> 42:46.300
Just watch the chain
and listen to my voice.

42:46.300 --> 42:47.600
- Daryl, stop.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.760
- You're thinking about
how nice it will be

42:50.760 --> 42:53.630
when you graduate, how
everything will be, okay.

42:53.630 --> 42:55.059
- What are you doing to me?

42:55.059 --> 42:55.892
Stop!

42:55.892 --> 42:57.073
- Laura, you will graduate.

42:58.421 --> 43:00.420
And everything will be just fine.

43:00.420 --> 43:01.920
- You can't make me go.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.483
I am not going back there,
I'm not going to go.

43:10.610 --> 43:12.710
- Hey man, don't even sweat it, all right.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.366
As soon as I go, Dee is
going to walk up in here

43:15.366 --> 43:16.440
and she's going to have a serious talk

43:16.440 --> 43:18.090
about you and your attitude.

43:18.090 --> 43:19.300
This is going to cut to some kind of deal.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.320
You're going to be off restriction man

43:20.320 --> 43:21.873
before I even get to work.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.910
But just don't forget Dee
is the shrink, all right?

43:24.910 --> 43:27.790
So, you know, talk to
her about your feelings

43:27.790 --> 43:29.280
and shit like that.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.780
You're going to get off light.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.460
I'm ready to leave.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.632
I got to go, so we'll
talk to later, right?

43:38.730 --> 43:40.480
The fall in the real world.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.350
- Lucky, welcome to DAN

43:43.350 --> 43:44.770
- I appreciate it, man, I really do.

43:44.770 --> 43:46.659
Hey guys, what's going on, huh?

43:46.659 --> 43:47.730
- Hey Lucky, how are you doing?

43:47.730 --> 43:49.390
- Hey man.
- We're good, man.

43:49.390 --> 43:50.310
- Hey lucky?

43:50.310 --> 43:51.143
Lucky?

43:52.110 --> 43:52.943
Tires.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.930
- You're off restriction?

44:09.930 --> 44:11.010
- Yeah.

44:11.010 --> 44:12.950
Well, everything is ready to go.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.290
- Talked to your brother?

44:14.290 --> 44:17.090
- That's affirmative, the
product is waiting for pickup.

44:18.620 --> 44:19.600
- Let's do it now.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.433
- All right.

44:23.260 --> 44:24.093
Take it easy.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.600
Turn them over so he
can get his leg there.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.417
- There we go.
- It's all right.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.040
Looks good.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.280
Yeah, there you go.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.550
- Let me get him, let me get him.

44:39.550 --> 44:40.383
Are you ready?

44:40.383 --> 44:41.997
All right, good luck, you know what to do.

44:41.997 --> 44:42.989
Good luck come on.

44:43.822 --> 44:45.710
Give it a kiss, for luck.

44:45.710 --> 44:46.543
- You want me to kiss the bird?

44:46.543 --> 44:47.643
- Yeah, come on.

44:49.570 --> 44:50.861
All right then.

44:57.270 --> 44:58.483
Go baby girl.

45:22.195 --> 45:23.656
- Welcome back.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.880
- You haven't done the toilets.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.560
- Well, I couldn't find the brush.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.610
- You still got to do them.

45:30.610 --> 45:32.780
I'll do it when I find the brush.

45:32.780 --> 45:34.060
- I'll have to write you up.

45:34.060 --> 45:36.070
- I'm not going to
clean shit with my hand.

45:36.070 --> 45:37.080
- Why not?

45:37.080 --> 45:38.423
Just so you get it done.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.560
- And what the hell is your problem?

45:41.560 --> 45:43.960
Just because I'm white,
I shouldn't live here.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.940
- Color ain't got anything to do with this

45:45.940 --> 45:48.080
it's who you are underneath.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.320
- And you don't know shit about me.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.240
- I know enough to hear how
you've been disrespecting me

45:52.240 --> 45:53.867
from the first day I saw you, man.

45:53.867 --> 45:55.860
I knew you wasn't gonna be a family, man.

45:55.860 --> 45:57.290
You don't care how we got

45:57.290 --> 45:59.070
to watch each other's backs in here.

45:59.070 --> 46:01.360
But that's the way it's got to be.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.193
If you want to make things right

46:02.193 --> 46:04.440
you need to apologize for what happened.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.588
- You're out of your mind.

46:05.588 --> 46:07.566
- I'm out of my mind.

46:07.566 --> 46:10.130
Now get into your boy shit, Roy boy.

46:10.130 --> 46:11.430
But I promise to make your life hell

46:11.430 --> 46:12.920
until you save yourself.

46:26.050 --> 46:26.883
Roy?

46:28.870 --> 46:30.840
Did you hear the bad news?

46:30.840 --> 46:31.673
- What?

46:31.673 --> 46:33.410
- They're graduating me in three days

46:33.410 --> 46:35.173
and I have to go home on Sunday.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.543
And I think they're
trying to get us apart.

46:46.700 --> 46:47.650
I don't want to go.

46:51.313 --> 46:53.293
- If you go, I'm not going to stay.

46:54.944 --> 46:55.944
- What should we do?

47:00.350 --> 47:02.799
outta here.

47:02.799 --> 47:03.800
- You mean run away?

47:03.800 --> 47:04.788
- Why not?

47:06.130 --> 47:07.870
- If we run now, we'll get caught.

47:07.870 --> 47:09.320
- Well then let's go tonight.

47:11.310 --> 47:12.640
- No, are you sure you want to do that?

47:12.640 --> 47:14.923
- Absolutely, I'm sick of this place.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.870
- Okay, tomorrow night, okay?

47:18.870 --> 47:21.100
I guess we'll have time to think about it.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.700
- Please don't change your mind.

47:46.450 --> 47:48.010
- So Daryl, how are you doing?
- How are doing?

47:48.010 --> 47:48.843
Good.

47:48.843 --> 47:51.200
Oh backward let's see hands.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.033
- Come on, Daryl.

47:52.033 --> 47:53.420
- Lets see them.

47:53.420 --> 47:54.253
Thank you.

47:54.253 --> 47:55.580
- Yeah, okay.

47:55.580 --> 47:56.460
- How was your day at work?

47:56.460 --> 47:58.137
- It was dirty, it was good, all right.

47:58.137 --> 47:59.530
You know what I'm saying, huh?

47:59.530 --> 48:01.033
- Okay, I'll be there with you, let's go.

48:32.915 --> 48:34.210
Time for you to go Lucky.

48:34.210 --> 48:35.547
- Have fun everybody.

48:39.720 --> 48:41.650
- All right family, here's the plan

48:41.650 --> 48:44.970
the front and backyards
both need extensive work.

48:44.970 --> 48:47.570
So that means everyone's
doing outside chores today.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.550
I know it's hot

48:49.550 --> 48:51.700
but we're supplying
sodas to ease the pain.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.360
All right now your
chores are on this list.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.757
Everyone gets a copy on the way out.

48:56.757 --> 48:57.773
Thank you family.

48:57.773 --> 48:59.410
Thank you, Daryl.

48:59.410 --> 49:00.600
- You're welcome.

49:03.195 --> 49:08.195
- Prax, you know you
gotta pick that back up.

49:09.510 --> 49:11.543
- Any sign of the pigeon?
- Nothing.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.456
- You think there's a problem?

49:13.456 --> 49:15.781
- No, we just have to wait.

49:30.456 --> 49:31.289
- Oh my God.

50:34.370 --> 50:35.203
- Laura?

50:40.890 --> 50:41.763
Over here.

50:42.650 --> 50:43.483
- Where are you?

50:44.490 --> 50:45.323
- Here?

50:47.740 --> 50:49.500
We still on for tonight?

50:49.500 --> 50:50.930
- Yeah.

50:50.930 --> 50:52.690
- 12 o'clock, okay?

50:52.690 --> 50:54.490
Midnight, I'll knock on your window.

50:58.550 --> 51:00.190
Laura.

51:00.190 --> 51:01.640
- Yeah.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.633
- Will you tell me why you're really here?

51:04.540 --> 51:05.490
- What do you mean?

51:10.150 --> 51:12.630
- I think you're hiding something.

51:12.630 --> 51:13.770
You know the pictures

51:13.770 --> 51:16.650
and well Dee said there's a lot of stuff

51:16.650 --> 51:17.800
about you I don't know.

51:18.700 --> 51:19.683
- What'd she say?

51:22.290 --> 51:23.520
- I'd like you to tell me.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.940
- Roy, it doesn't matter anymore.

51:24.940 --> 51:26.503
It's in the past.

51:26.503 --> 51:28.143
- Why can't you just tell me?

51:29.013 --> 51:31.188
I mean, cause then I wonder

51:31.188 --> 51:34.020
and it just turns into a big deal.

51:34.020 --> 51:38.613
- If I tell you, will you promise
not to hold it against me?

51:39.680 --> 51:40.563
- Of course.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.123
- I used to cut myself.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.950
- What?

51:47.950 --> 51:49.593
- I used to cut myself.

51:50.770 --> 51:54.080
- What do you mean you like
tried to kill yourself?

51:54.080 --> 51:57.930
- No, it's it's like a disease.

51:57.930 --> 52:01.030
You cut yourself whenever
you feel bad about things.

52:01.030 --> 52:02.333
It's a compulsion.

52:03.680 --> 52:08.280
It's how I used to punish myself
for not being good enough.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.670
- And that's why you're here.

52:09.670 --> 52:12.530
- It's not like I was crazy or anything.

52:12.530 --> 52:15.073
It's just that I feel bad sometimes.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.173
So,

52:18.460 --> 52:23.460
I'd take a razor and
I'd cut between my toes

52:23.650 --> 52:27.050
or by my ears wherever
you can't see the scars,

52:27.050 --> 52:28.393
but where it bleeds a lot.

52:29.600 --> 52:32.600
And then everybody freak out.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.870
I got sent to a psych
hospital a couple of times

52:35.870 --> 52:39.903
but whenever I came home
again, I started cutting.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.003
So they sent me here.

52:44.190 --> 52:46.130
- And now you're okay?

52:46.130 --> 52:47.263
- Yep.

52:51.610 --> 52:52.443
Are you?

52:54.930 --> 52:55.763
- Of course

53:04.100 --> 53:05.620
- DAN service.

53:05.620 --> 53:06.453
This is DAN.

53:10.527 --> 53:11.360
He did?

53:12.919 --> 53:14.338
- Now you're stealing from me, huh?

53:14.338 --> 53:15.360
- Nobody is stealing.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.487
- Don't you lie to me.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.120
- All right, everyone to their room.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.010
get moving.

53:22.010 --> 53:23.740
Come on, let's go.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.060
Come on family.

53:25.060 --> 53:25.900
- What's up?

53:25.900 --> 53:28.110
- Room restriction Kevin, let's go.

53:28.110 --> 53:29.870
Out of my face Kevin, this moment.

53:29.870 --> 53:30.763
Leave that here.

53:33.908 --> 53:34.741
- Oh.

53:41.450 --> 53:42.533
Shit.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.310
I want your attention, family.

53:46.310 --> 53:48.790
Dee and I are preparing a
list of all the contraband

53:48.790 --> 53:50.630
we found in your rooms.

53:50.630 --> 53:52.820
Later, we'll meet with each to determine

53:52.820 --> 53:54.103
the bookings and LPs.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.190
In the meantime, we're
on THS total house safety

53:59.190 --> 54:00.650
where you have the remainder of the day

54:00.650 --> 54:03.700
to organize your rooms and
think about why we need rules

54:03.700 --> 54:06.720
to structure our lives and keep us safe.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.920
I suggest you also make use of this time

54:08.920 --> 54:11.900
by doing a Purdue inventory
on why you're here

54:11.900 --> 54:15.460
and whether or not you're
taking this program seriously.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.225
Because if you're not,

54:17.225 --> 54:21.125
we can certainly give you some chance.

54:45.502 --> 54:46.835
- What happened?

54:48.336 --> 54:49.336
- It's over.

54:50.750 --> 54:52.653
Daryl, found my screwdriver.

54:56.564 --> 54:57.397
I got fired.

55:00.410 --> 55:04.663
How do you even graduate
till I'm 18, five months.

55:05.860 --> 55:07.660
- And why the hell did you steal it?

55:13.401 --> 55:15.300
- Well, I gotta have a weapon, man.

55:15.300 --> 55:17.723
There's no peace without a weapon.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.890
- I'm running tonight with Laura.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.010
If you want to come.

55:29.010 --> 55:31.290
- Man, that's a stupid idea, man.

55:31.290 --> 55:32.135
They're going to catch you,

55:32.135 --> 55:33.682
you going to be sent
right back to the hall.

55:33.682 --> 55:34.660
- Hey look I'm tired of being treated

55:34.660 --> 55:36.340
like a piece of shit around here.

55:36.340 --> 55:39.350
No matter what the I do, I lose.

55:39.350 --> 55:41.770
Well, I'm not a loser and
I'm not going to wait around

55:41.770 --> 55:43.470
for them to turn me into one.

55:43.470 --> 55:44.440
- And you really think you gonna be able

55:44.440 --> 55:47.240
to hide out for two years, man, two years?

55:47.240 --> 55:48.860
- I don't have a choice.

55:48.860 --> 55:51.533
It's either run or curl up and die.

55:58.030 --> 55:59.103
- I don't know, man.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.063
This is probably the
best home I've ever had.

56:05.420 --> 56:07.500
I mean, I know Daryl was a pain
in the ass most of the time

56:07.500 --> 56:10.483
but it could be a lot worse.

56:12.100 --> 56:14.890
- If that's the way you feel
then why do you want out?

56:14.890 --> 56:15.723
- You know why?

56:15.723 --> 56:19.210
Because I've tried and I've
tried to adjust to this place.

56:19.210 --> 56:22.793
I can't, I'm a warrior.

56:24.210 --> 56:25.323
I know that now.

56:26.687 --> 56:27.523
That's who I am.

56:31.410 --> 56:33.830
Well, do you even
know where you're going?

56:33.830 --> 56:34.720
- Roy does.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.460
There's a cabin in the
mountains he knows about.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.930
So we'll stay there for awhile.

56:37.930 --> 56:39.540
- You mean in the wilderness.

56:39.540 --> 56:41.190
- You know, I used to think I'd be scared

56:41.190 --> 56:42.700
leaving this place.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.580
Now I'm just excited, you know?

56:44.580 --> 56:46.740
Like I'm waking up from a bad dream

56:46.740 --> 56:48.890
and I get a second chance.

56:48.890 --> 56:50.800
Can't wait to get out
and start living again.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.270
- You gotta be careful Laura,

56:52.270 --> 56:54.930
girl it ain't so easy being on the run.

56:54.930 --> 56:56.150
- We'll be okay.

56:56.150 --> 56:57.183
And we like each other enough.

56:57.183 --> 56:58.940
I know, things will work out.

56:58.940 --> 57:01.410
- I wish it was that simple.

57:01.410 --> 57:03.420
- Stop being so negative Kiwi, okay?

57:03.420 --> 57:04.870
I've really good feelings about this.

57:04.870 --> 57:07.114
I don't want you to bring me down.

57:13.147 --> 57:16.940
- Are you sure you don't
want to change your mind.

57:16.940 --> 57:19.440
- You're the one that
should be changing his mind.

57:21.682 --> 57:22.780
Have you even thought
about what's gonna happen

57:22.780 --> 57:24.860
to Laura if she gets caught?

57:24.860 --> 57:26.240
- What do you mean?

57:26.240 --> 57:29.010
- It's going to do her
time all over again.

57:29.010 --> 57:30.420
You've only been here a few days, man.

57:30.420 --> 57:31.960
You don't have much to lose.

57:31.960 --> 57:33.210
She's got 10 months.

57:33.210 --> 57:37.773
Wake up, wake up Chimera House.

57:37.773 --> 57:39.730
We're out here waiting for you.

57:39.730 --> 57:41.040
Hello you there.

57:41.040 --> 57:41.873
- Oh shit!

57:44.966 --> 57:46.163
- What the hell are you doing?

57:47.355 --> 57:49.880
- I know this shit, always coming in here.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.697
Today he won't get away with this.

57:51.697 --> 57:53.460
- Are you crazy?

57:53.460 --> 57:55.176
Lucky, don't do this.

57:55.176 --> 57:57.050
- I got to do this okay?

57:57.050 --> 57:57.963
Myself.

58:00.570 --> 58:01.970
Daryl never needs to know.

58:13.640 --> 58:14.473
- Hello?

58:17.270 --> 58:18.220
Yeah this is Daryl.

58:22.170 --> 58:24.320
Are you sure it's one mine?

58:27.184 --> 58:28.640
- What are you doing?

58:28.640 --> 58:29.563
Turn it off.

58:33.725 --> 58:35.483
Damn I want to sleep.

58:51.490 --> 58:52.360
- God damn it Lucky.

58:52.360 --> 58:55.000
How the hell am I supposed
to leave with Daryl on alert?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.800
You really fucked things up for me.

58:56.800 --> 58:57.950
- It was worth it, man.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.920
I got one of them real good.

59:03.860 --> 59:05.110
- What the hell happened?

59:07.650 --> 59:08.630
- Check this out.

59:08.630 --> 59:10.000
When I got outside, right?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.710
I heard that one voice yelling
by the vacant lot, right?

59:12.710 --> 59:14.500
So I kept him on the
side of the house, right

59:14.500 --> 59:15.610
to like I said there was three of them

59:15.610 --> 59:16.827
hanging over by the fence.

59:20.660 --> 59:23.050
When I got real close, I
heard them talking about,

59:23.050 --> 59:25.060
came back to their group
home and stuff like that.

59:25.060 --> 59:27.090
We're staff on the but we are punks

59:27.950 --> 59:30.096
Edge wait, you
know what I'm saying?

59:30.096 --> 59:32.530
- That's when one of them
started spray painting our fence.

59:32.530 --> 59:35.222
Right then I knew it was
time for these

59:35.222 --> 59:36.722
to feel some pain.

59:43.300 --> 59:45.310
I've been only fucked to
one of them up though, man.

59:45.310 --> 59:46.290
Cause he led to running off so fast.

59:49.330 --> 59:51.039
but it was beautiful, man.

59:51.039 --> 59:52.823
Beautiful.

59:53.690 --> 59:56.083
Best thing I've done in this place.

59:58.430 --> 1:00:00.430
- It's probably cause Daryl on the alert.

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:01.760
You can't expect Roy to come,

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:03.560
if he thinks he can get busted.

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:07.220
- It's not that I know it's not
that, he's changed his mind.

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:10.480
- Laura, you can't know that
you can run tomorrow night.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.220
It's just not safe tonight.

1:00:12.220 --> 1:00:15.220
- So stupid, I never should
have told him about the cutting.

1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:19.820
He won't go now, he thinks
I'm too weird and crazy.

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:21.250
- Just stop it, Laura.

1:00:21.250 --> 1:00:23.350
- It's true, in two days, I'll be back

1:00:23.350 --> 1:00:27.790
with my fucked up stepdad
and nothing will have change.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:29.213
Nothing ever changes.

1:01:09.555 --> 1:01:12.305
- I want to see you in my office.

1:01:14.014 --> 1:01:14.847
- Me?

1:01:14.847 --> 1:01:15.907
- Now!

1:01:21.027 --> 1:01:21.860
- Hey.

1:01:25.009 --> 1:01:25.842
You okay?

1:01:30.350 --> 1:01:31.537
Hey Daryl was on the prowl last night.

1:01:31.537 --> 1:01:32.723
Can we make a new plan?

1:01:36.330 --> 1:01:37.340
Laura?

1:01:37.340 --> 1:01:40.330
- Look, you would have come
last night if you really wanted.

1:01:40.330 --> 1:01:41.257
- What?

1:01:41.257 --> 1:01:43.590
- I don't think you want
to go with me anymore.

1:01:43.590 --> 1:01:45.170
- That's not true.

1:01:45.170 --> 1:01:46.920
- I'm not dumb, Roy.

1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.590
I mean, if I were you I'd
have second thoughts too.

1:01:49.590 --> 1:01:51.240
- I'm not having second thoughts, I just.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:54.030
- Come on Roy, I told
you the truth about me.

1:01:54.030 --> 1:01:55.610
Just tell me the truth about you.

1:01:55.610 --> 1:01:57.060
- I am telling you the truth.

1:02:09.184 --> 1:02:11.650
- I need your help, man.

1:02:11.650 --> 1:02:12.990
One of those Edge wood punks recognize me

1:02:12.990 --> 1:02:15.110
and got word back to Daryl.

1:02:15.110 --> 1:02:16.890
I'm gonna need an alibi.

1:02:16.890 --> 1:02:18.240
- Like what?

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:20.340
- You tell him that I never left our room.

1:02:23.100 --> 1:02:25.150
- Look, man, they don't
have anything on you.

1:02:25.150 --> 1:02:26.950
It's your word against theirs?

1:02:26.950 --> 1:02:28.580
- What are you talking about?

1:02:28.580 --> 1:02:29.413
Man, there was three of them out there.

1:02:29.413 --> 1:02:31.220
You know that three of them

1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:34.170
they are trying to charge
me with assault on this.

1:02:34.170 --> 1:02:35.090
You got to do this for me, man.

1:02:35.090 --> 1:02:35.923
I need you.

1:02:37.395 --> 1:02:39.195
- I'm not gonna make any difference.

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:44.400
- Well, you know what
is payback time, man?

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:47.173
You remember, man, you owe me this much.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:57.060
- I just came by to say that
lucky couldn't have done

1:02:57.060 --> 1:02:58.530
what they said he did.

1:02:58.530 --> 1:03:00.380
We were talking till almost midnight.

1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:04.390
- This isn't about lucky
Roy, it's about you.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:07.963
We have all the evidence
we need to get Lucky.

1:03:10.203 --> 1:03:11.690
I know he's your roommate.

1:03:11.690 --> 1:03:13.853
You want to help out it's commendable.

1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:17.170
I admire that, but it's too late

1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:20.330
but you can help yourself though.

1:03:20.330 --> 1:03:23.570
Tell the truth and we'll make
sure your PO hears about it.

1:03:23.570 --> 1:03:26.020
Continue lying and I'll consider
you, Lucky as accomplished.

1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:29.368
And you'll be having dinner
in the hall, your choice.

1:04:20.730 --> 1:04:22.130
- I brought you some dinner.

1:04:23.430 --> 1:04:26.213
Forget it Lucky Daryl's
sitting right outside.

1:04:26.213 --> 1:04:29.123
- Fuck, I'm so fucked Laura.

1:04:29.123 --> 1:04:30.853
Look I'm so screwed.

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:33.240
Can you help me out?

1:04:36.410 --> 1:04:38.359
I'm such a piece of shit.

1:04:38.359 --> 1:04:39.609
I'm such a piece of shit.

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:43.470
Listen to me, you got to tell Roy please.

1:04:43.470 --> 1:04:45.930
No matter what Daryl
says, he's only bluffing.

1:04:45.930 --> 1:04:47.373
Daryl got nothing on me.

1:04:48.670 --> 1:04:49.930
You gotta tell him he's
got to stick to our story

1:04:49.930 --> 1:04:51.273
no matter what, okay?

1:04:51.273 --> 1:04:52.106
Laura will you do this for me.

1:04:52.106 --> 1:04:55.020
You got to do this one, please, please.

1:04:55.020 --> 1:04:56.760
He can't get into their bluff.

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:57.593
- I'll tell him.

1:04:58.760 --> 1:04:59.980
- Because if he doesn't I'm fucked,

1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:02.103
I'm so, I'm doomed.

1:05:08.363 --> 1:05:09.463
Will you pray with me?

1:05:20.330 --> 1:05:25.330
Lord, if you can hear me,
please, please forgive me.

1:05:25.670 --> 1:05:29.120
I know I've pushed a lot of
buttons and I'm truly sorry

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:32.100
but I would like just
one more chance please.

1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:34.840
So if you can somehow
see it in your heart,

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:37.863
Lord get me out of here please,
Lord get us all out of here.

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:41.670
Lord, please give Roy
this strength he needs

1:05:41.670 --> 1:05:45.100
to stand up Daryl and Dee
don't let him back down

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.633
or fall for their tricks.

1:05:48.919 --> 1:05:52.243
I'm just asking for one chance
Lord, just one chance please.

1:05:53.551 --> 1:05:55.592
I promise, I promise.

1:05:55.592 --> 1:05:57.242
- It's time for you to go, Laura.

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:04.590
- Good luck, Lucky.

1:06:13.450 --> 1:06:15.669
Don't sweat
out in this house please,

1:06:15.669 --> 1:06:16.768
what are you drinking?

1:06:16.768 --> 1:06:18.800
You're always drinking.
- Oh shut up!

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.637
- Stop.
- Shut up right now!

1:06:21.907 --> 1:06:23.740
I'm sick of bullshit.

1:06:24.919 --> 1:06:26.617
- Don't touch me.
- Damn ass.

1:06:26.617 --> 1:06:28.999
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck damn it, shut up.

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:52.171
- Hey, anyone going there
outside, will be arrested

1:06:52.171 --> 1:06:53.240
and thrown to the hall.

1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:54.398
No, I said.

1:06:54.398 --> 1:06:56.647
- This is war Daryl, we have
the right to defend our home.

1:06:56.647 --> 1:06:58.939
- Did you hear what I
said put down the stick

1:06:58.939 --> 1:07:01.733
and go to your room, now!

1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:07.013
Oh there.

1:07:11.490 --> 1:07:12.940
- This is an emergency.

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:14.193
We need the police.

1:07:15.091 --> 1:07:17.015
- Laura get away from there,

1:07:17.015 --> 1:07:18.974
get away from that window.

1:07:18.974 --> 1:07:20.160
- Come on run, Roy let's go.

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:21.100
- Where are we going?

1:07:21.100 --> 1:07:22.630
- Lets run while they're distracted.

1:07:22.630 --> 1:07:23.930
- Wait a minute.

1:07:23.930 --> 1:07:25.170
- What do you mean?

1:07:25.170 --> 1:07:26.083
You said you wanted to go?

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.430
- I do, but listen,

1:07:27.430 --> 1:07:29.100
okay tomorrow you're graduating.

1:07:29.100 --> 1:07:29.933
You'll be legal.

1:07:29.933 --> 1:07:30.860
Let's wait a couple of days.

1:07:30.860 --> 1:07:33.080
I'll meet you at your dad's
place and we'll go from there.

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:33.913
- That's stupid.

1:07:33.913 --> 1:07:36.030
If you really want to do it, let's go now.

1:07:36.030 --> 1:07:37.780
- It's better for you with me, wait.

1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:38.910
- No that's not the point, Roy

1:07:38.910 --> 1:07:40.510
we're not going to get another chance.

1:07:40.510 --> 1:07:41.343
- Yes we will Laura,

1:07:41.343 --> 1:07:42.600
if we don't get caught
up in all of this shit.

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:44.633
- Come on it's now or never.

1:07:44.633 --> 1:07:46.510
- Laura, Roy?

1:07:46.510 --> 1:07:49.225
- Okay Laura, I promise
in a couple of days.

1:07:58.945 --> 1:08:01.718
- Hey come on Prax, open the door, man.

1:08:01.718 --> 1:08:04.801
- Hey come on, we're getting you out.

1:08:09.346 --> 1:08:11.945
- I'll take care of it,
please can you hear me?

1:08:11.945 --> 1:08:13.238
I'll take care of it.

1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:30.440
- Roy, where's Laura at?

1:08:32.777 --> 1:08:34.613
- I don't know what the
fuck's going on with her.

1:09:07.381 --> 1:09:09.048
- Don't do this, man

1:09:12.510 --> 1:09:14.900
Laura open up the door girl.

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:16.590
- Go away leave me alone.

1:09:16.590 --> 1:09:19.643
Open it up girl,
it's Kiwi, just let me in.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:21.353
Laura?

1:09:21.353 --> 1:09:25.610
- And you shit you destroy
everything, I hate you.

1:09:27.164 --> 1:09:28.081
I hate you.

1:09:31.930 --> 1:09:35.103
- Laura, don't do anything stupid.

1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:38.463
Please, Laura.

1:09:40.290 --> 1:09:44.170
There is a lot of crazy
shit going on out there

1:09:44.170 --> 1:09:47.003
and it's making us all feel real bad,

1:09:48.370 --> 1:09:50.784
but girl it ain't about us.

1:09:50.784 --> 1:09:51.617
- Don't!

1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:56.820
- We promised to help
each other out, remember

1:09:56.820 --> 1:09:58.760
if the ghosts ever came back

1:10:00.420 --> 1:10:02.913
we said that we would
be there for each other.

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:07.410
Can we just talk about
this for a minute girl?

1:10:07.410 --> 1:10:08.810
- It won't make any difference.

1:10:08.810 --> 1:10:10.030
- Yeah, it will.

1:10:10.030 --> 1:10:13.090
It'll make a big difference
if we don't give it up.

1:10:13.090 --> 1:10:15.420
- No, not for me, it won't.

1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:17.187
- Laura girl, I care about you.

1:10:17.187 --> 1:10:19.450
- You're the only one.

1:10:19.450 --> 1:10:21.690
- That's not true I just seen Roy outside

1:10:21.690 --> 1:10:24.809
and he's real worried about you.

1:10:24.809 --> 1:10:25.973
- I don't believe you.

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:30.180
- You're putting an awful
lot of pressure on yourself.

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.600
Give it some time.

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:35.850
- Is it any time?

1:10:35.850 --> 1:10:39.050
- Can I tell you what I
do when I feel hopeless?

1:10:39.050 --> 1:10:41.610
I tell myself that for one
day I'm going to pretend

1:10:41.610 --> 1:10:44.420
to feel positive and
hopeful and I for one day,

1:10:44.420 --> 1:10:46.120
I'll pretend to be somebody

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.143
who really expects
something good to happen.

1:10:52.420 --> 1:10:53.563
- What happens?

1:10:55.090 --> 1:10:56.393
- Things get better.

1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:00.890
It's true, at least give it a try Laura.

1:11:00.890 --> 1:11:02.923
Cause girl, if you cut yourself,

1:11:03.873 --> 1:11:05.520
they're going to send you away

1:11:06.410 --> 1:11:07.980
and then you never going home.

1:11:23.255 --> 1:11:26.100
run?

1:11:26.100 --> 1:11:27.803
that you are on.

1:11:27.803 --> 1:11:30.070
- All right, it's over.

1:11:30.070 --> 1:11:32.077
Everybody's to their rooms now.

1:11:32.077 --> 1:11:34.000
I should've helped you out.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.923
- Yo Daryl, we're going to the hall?

1:11:38.762 --> 1:11:40.735
Monica let's go.

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:41.902
Kevin come on.

1:11:44.139 --> 1:11:44.974
- Kevin?

1:11:44.974 --> 1:11:47.035
- Oh man, lets go, its Five O, man,

1:11:47.035 --> 1:11:47.955
let's go come on.

1:11:47.955 --> 1:11:49.249
- Prax you can go, man.

1:11:49.249 --> 1:11:50.082
- I'm not leaving you.

1:11:50.082 --> 1:11:51.196
I'm not leaving you.

1:11:51.196 --> 1:11:52.029
Let's go, get up.

1:11:52.029 --> 1:11:53.313
- You go, fuck.

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:02.326
- They were completely having fun.

1:12:02.326 --> 1:12:04.177
- Oh you're ready, you're ready?

1:12:04.177 --> 1:12:06.039
One two three.

1:12:18.750 --> 1:12:20.160
- You're doing okay.

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:20.993
- I'm good.

1:12:22.550 --> 1:12:23.950
Did you tell Daryl anything?

1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:26.733
- No.

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.730
- You weren't going to back down.

1:12:34.870 --> 1:12:36.160
- Okay, it doesn't matter anymore, okay?

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:38.369
So let's just not talk about it.

1:12:38.369 --> 1:12:40.380
- I need to know man.

1:12:40.380 --> 1:12:41.880
It's important.

1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:44.200
- Look, I don't know what
I was going to do, okay?

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.740
But I wasn't willing to
go to the hall for you.

1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:47.870
That's too much to ask.

1:12:47.870 --> 1:12:50.863
- He's only bluffing,
he had nothing on me.

1:12:52.100 --> 1:12:54.520
- It doesn't matter anymore, Lucky.

1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:55.353
- Believe it.

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.043
You were going to fall for his shit.

1:12:59.293 --> 1:13:00.763
And I risked my neck for you.

1:13:04.810 --> 1:13:06.130
- Get yourself together.

1:13:06.130 --> 1:13:06.963
Let's go.

1:13:09.780 --> 1:13:11.790
- What about him?

1:13:11.790 --> 1:13:12.930
He's all right.

1:13:12.930 --> 1:13:15.070
You're under
arrest for assault.

1:13:15.070 --> 1:13:16.870
You have the right to remain silent.

1:13:22.310 --> 1:13:24.213
- Seem kinda lonely around here, huh?

1:13:37.210 --> 1:13:38.240
- Morning?

1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:39.073
- Hi.

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:43.363
- Anyone wants some juice?

1:13:46.430 --> 1:13:50.563
- Well, here we are survivors
from the night of hell.

1:13:51.590 --> 1:13:53.260
- Is lucky okay?

1:13:53.260 --> 1:13:55.227
- He's pretty messed up.

1:13:55.227 --> 1:13:57.127
I didn't show that to the cops though.

1:14:00.750 --> 1:14:02.280
So how are you?

1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:05.453
- Okay I guess, I'm
supposed to graduate today.

1:14:07.050 --> 1:14:07.883
- What time?

1:14:07.883 --> 1:14:10.460
- I don't know all I
know is my stepdad feels

1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:12.200
like picking me up.

1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:15.200
- Well, can I get your
address and phone number?

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.620
Because in a couple of days
I'll be giving you a call.

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:19.360
- You still want to run?

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:21.390
- That's the plan, you still want to go?

1:14:21.390 --> 1:14:25.293
- I don't know, things got
pretty screwed up, didn't they?.

1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:33.760
- Listen Laura, I don't think
I'm ever going to graduate

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:34.913
from this place.

1:14:36.030 --> 1:14:38.936
I mean, look, what
happened to all of them.

1:14:44.301 --> 1:14:46.264
Come one give it another chance.

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:52.090
- Anybody wants some strawberry Kiwi.

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:08.783
- We have some important news for you.

1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.400
There's going to be an investigation

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:14.600
and we're closing the
house until it's over.

1:15:16.550 --> 1:15:17.650
- What does that mean?

1:15:18.970 --> 1:15:21.420
- Well, it means that Laura
would graduate as scheduled

1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:25.830
and Keisha will be moved
to a group home in Texas.

1:15:25.830 --> 1:15:26.843
- What about me.

1:15:28.910 --> 1:15:30.680
- It means you're going back to the hall.

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:31.670
- That's not fair.

1:15:31.670 --> 1:15:33.530
- You can't do that, I
haven't broken any rules.

1:15:33.530 --> 1:15:36.530
- Things don't always work out
the way we want them to, Roy.

1:15:38.107 --> 1:15:39.467
Oh, I'm sorry, son.

1:15:44.504 --> 1:15:46.816
Don't make it difficult.

1:16:28.724 --> 1:16:29.557
- Shit!

1:18:23.584 --> 1:18:28.584
flask can be fed up

1:18:54.508 --> 1:18:59.508
them to be laughter

1:19:01.510 --> 1:19:06.510
my mother told me that

1:19:08.713 --> 1:19:13.713
could celebrate America

1:19:33.828 --> 1:19:38.828
people specialists effects

1:19:47.397 --> 1:19:52.397
conversation just give me hope

1:19:54.416 --> 1:19:59.416
the end of your road

1:20:01.729 --> 1:20:06.729
on me and walk away

1:20:08.629 --> 1:20:13.629
I can do to make you stay
