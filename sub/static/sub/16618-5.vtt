05:02.102 --> 05:04.002
Speaking of once-in-a-lifetime
experiences, Kent,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.171
I understand you have
a fascinating story

05:06.173 --> 05:07.639
about your time in Basra.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.842
Well, Jimmy, I was embedded
with the 98th Airborne.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.111
My lullaby was
the thwap-thwap-thwap

05:13.113 --> 05:14.579
of the blades of a Chinook.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.348
I was in the
98th Airborne.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.116
I don't remember him.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.751
I don't even remember
what I said

05:19.753 --> 05:21.453
at the start
of this sentence!

05:21.455 --> 05:23.088
Out there, everyone was equal.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.123
I was "Brock,"
the pilot was "Bama."

05:25.125 --> 05:26.425
Was he from Alabama?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.160
He was from America, Jimmy.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.195
To me, it was just another day
at the office.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.964
Only this day, the office
was a burning piece of metal

05:32.966 --> 05:35.267
where an RPG
just took out the pilot.

05:35.269 --> 05:38.003
So I grabbed the joystick
and guided that wounded bird

05:38.005 --> 05:40.939
down onto a container ship--
which was sinking.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.442
I bailed it with my helmet
and guided her home.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.243
(audience cheering)

05:47.014 --> 05:48.780
That didn't happen, man!

05:48.782 --> 05:51.516
Oh, you Iraq War vets
are always complaining.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.151
(mocking):
"That didn't happen."

05:53.153 --> 05:56.488
"The temperature was 125."

05:56.490 --> 05:59.057
"The U.S.O. show
was Rob Schneider."

05:59.059 --> 06:03.328
"American objectives have been,
and remain, incomprehensible."

06:03.330 --> 06:05.864
Wah-wah-wah.

humble apology.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.913
(dramatic kettle drum plays)

06:21.915 --> 06:23.415
You know,
we in the news business

06:23.417 --> 06:26.017
like to report the story;
we don't like to<i> be</i> the story.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.320
That's what I said to Nelson
Mandela atop the Berlin Wall,

06:28.322 --> 06:30.922
but... No, I didn't.
That's the problem!

06:30.924 --> 06:32.224
Now you're not eating.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.860
I can't eat when
I'm watching the spectacle

06:34.862 --> 06:36.228
of an imploding celebrity.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.029
We have lip-quiver, people.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.532
I'm sorry to report to you
that over the years,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.234
every interesting thing
I've done is,

06:42.236 --> 06:43.535
in fact, a complete lie.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.203
I did not land
a Chinook helicopter.

06:45.205 --> 06:48.507
I did not see bin Laden die,
or even see the movie about it.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.909
Now that I've apologized,
my station has assured me

06:50.911 --> 06:52.411
that it has full confidence...

06:52.413 --> 06:55.414
These were the last words of
disgraced anchor Kent Brockman

06:55.416 --> 06:57.516
before he was escorted out
by security

06:57.518 --> 06:59.418
and replaced by me, Arnie Pye.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.186
This reporter promises

07:01.188 --> 07:04.022
to restore our news department's
credibility.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.726
In our top story,
corporate taxes are too high.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.195
Geez, I'm really gonna
miss Anderson Cooper.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.130
That wasn't
Anderson Cooper.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.598
Oh, thank God.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.034
I'm not licked yet--
not as long as I've got

07:16.036 --> 07:18.503
a cell phone and a place to sit.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.206
Company car.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.641
(tires screech)

07:24.311 --> 07:27.379
Marge, I think I may
have to get new clothes.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.914
(whispers):
At last!

07:28.916 --> 07:31.216
It's time for me to
project the image

07:31.218 --> 07:33.885
of a powerful,
self-reliant man.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.121
Will you take me
shopping after school?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.657
Sure. And after that,
maybe you could...

07:38.659 --> 07:41.059
oh, I don't know,
lose a little weight?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.995
Marge, no, don't get greedy,
don't get greedy.

07:43.997 --> 07:48.400
Sweetheart, I'm<i> always</i> happy
to temporarily lose weight.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.816

08:04.818 --> 08:07.118
Hmm. I call these num-nums

my fingers numb.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.456
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.692
Why are the only
ingredients here

08:13.694 --> 08:16.761
"water, fun
and hydrogenated chuckles"?

08:16.763 --> 08:18.964
Hey, Krusty makes
quality products.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.099

08:21.101 --> 08:23.668
Mm, let me try
one of those candies.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.175
I shared a meal with Lisa.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.011
It's halfway to a kiss.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.212
Now<i> I</i> kissed Lisa.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.014
No one kissed Lisa!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.682
Hmm?
Hmm?

08:37.684 --> 08:40.185
Hmm, I don't think candy
should give me a tingling

08:40.187 --> 08:41.686
in my left arm.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.388
I'm gonna prove
to you that Krusty

08:43.390 --> 08:45.724

nonlethal candy.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.393
Hey, Otto-man, can you take us

08:48.395 --> 08:49.528
No way, Bartman.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.996
Hey, Otto,
I just remembered,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.365

10:34.768 --> 10:36.635
(chuckles):
for this rudderless anchor?

10:36.637 --> 10:39.070
Forget it. We only like
newspeople we can trust.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.772
So no newspeople!

10:40.774 --> 10:42.674
Oh, well, I have
bigger problems.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.176

10:49.016 --> 10:51.249
Don't worry,
Krusty's favorite number

is how many jokes he's written.

about Krusty.

is reeking with chemicals!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.440
Just once
I'd like to be wrong.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.276
Well, from what I read in your
diary, you're rarely right.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.711
(groans)

11:19.713 --> 11:21.713
We've got to get
these samples analyzed.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.049
Bart, do you think
we'll get out of here safely?

11:24.051 --> 11:26.117

we will drop you.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.660
That's a promise.

12:08.662 --> 12:11.563
Well, could you, uh,
get me on Fox News?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.732
Would you be willing
to call yourself a liberal

12:13.734 --> 12:15.100
and lose every discussion?

12:15.102 --> 12:16.835
Every single one?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.570
Okay, you've already asked
too many questions.

"Here is a leader of men--

You know,
I've always wondered that.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.207

<i>Oh, what have we here?</i>

12:56.209 --> 12:58.076
Uh, Lisa, these vials

Formaldehyde!
Do you understand?

13:02.315 --> 13:03.948
Do not imbibe!

13:03.950 --> 13:05.984
Check. No imbibing.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.954
Bart! Imbibing is eating,
and formaldehyde is poison.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.791
Oh, you take all the fun
out of eating poison.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.059
You're just an
apologist for Krusty.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.162
I am<i> not</i> a paid apologist

13:32.245 --> 13:34.312
Sorry, kid, not

13:34.314 --> 13:35.947
Krusty's our

I'm gonna have to go
off the grid.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.001
All right, Kent Brockman.
Welcome to BizzFad.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.636
We are so crunched.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.105
(chuckles): Well,
the crunching is mutual.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.641
"The crunching is mutual"?
What the hell does that mean?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.677
Well, I know that
the media has changed,

14:05.679 --> 14:08.947
but this old newshound
can still find his way home.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.115
Okay...

14:11.117 --> 14:14.018
I thought I might do a piece on
all the crazy ice cream flavors

14:14.020 --> 14:15.053
they have these days.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.187
Bacon? Really?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.522
(chuckles)

14:17.524 --> 14:20.058
Kent, I like it. I do.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.160
But we just went bankrupt.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.162
Uh, people, people,
you're all fired.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.464
But, seriously,
it's been a great four days.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.899
Thank you.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.970
Uh, gentlemen, I suggest
we ramp up production.

14:31.972 --> 14:37.041
I have a few suggestions
right here in my pocket.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.344
Do it, Homer! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:39.346 --> 14:41.346

Are you Lust?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.147
No. Lupus.

Hey, fatso,

14:48.588 --> 14:51.189
I'd close that tent flap
before the mosquitoes get in.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.190
(chuckles)

14:52.192 --> 14:53.258
What the...?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.093
I thought you would like it.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.829
Actually, I think
you should take this tarp

14:57.831 --> 15:00.198
back to the baseball stadium
you got it from.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.000
In case there's a rain delay.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.702
(chuckles) I did not
see that coming, sir.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.104
Off you go, Simpson.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.906
Never seek
to better yourself again.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.375
I'm just going to shove my foot
on your back for emphasis.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.510
Yes, sir. I understand.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.380
But could you try not
to get my new jacket dirty?

15:15.382 --> 15:16.981
Sorry, but no.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.250
Well done, sir.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.052
Now your turn, Smithers.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.154
I never thought
you'd ask.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.259
So, why do you want to give
the story to Brockman?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.895
Because the best thing you
can do is offer a lifeline

15:30.897 --> 15:32.697
to a person with no hope.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.032
Here I am!

15:34.034 --> 15:35.066
Sorry, not you.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.768
Thank God!

15:36.770 --> 15:38.770
Well, how do you know
where Brockman will be?

15:38.772 --> 15:39.971
To find a fallen man,

15:39.973 --> 15:42.607
you must visit the scene
of his highest peak.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.310
When he reported
on the flood of '09.

15:46.813 --> 15:50.148
My career and these flood waters
crested at the same time.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.116
This is Kent Brockman
blowing a sad song

15:52.118 --> 15:53.618
on his beer bottle.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.220
(playing sad tune)

15:57.891 --> 16:00.892
Mr. Brockman, we've
uncovered a huge story!

16:00.894 --> 16:04.729
And we need a real newsman
to break it wide open.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.133
(sighs)

16:09.135 --> 16:10.568
A real newsman, eh?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.170
Then you've come
to the wrong corner.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.237
What do you mean?

16:13.239 --> 16:14.472
Oh, I'm through.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.240
Now, please,
let me just go out

16:16.242 --> 16:19.010
with my remaining dignity
intact.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.013
This is Kent Brockman thinking
dark and suicidal thoughts.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.281
It's quiet here in the gutter.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.282
Very quiet.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.583
Well, it<i> was.</i>

16:31.624 --> 16:34.025
Okay, who would like
to start today?

16:34.027 --> 16:37.662
Anyone? Anyone?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.731
Oh, come on.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.635
In three, two...

16:44.637 --> 16:46.137

at the support group...

16:46.139 --> 16:47.305

16:47.307 --> 16:49.440
This just in: I'm sad.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.442

I'll be tooling around,

16:51.444 --> 16:56.147

into my elocution exercises.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.520
Oh, I've been there.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.122
Too true.
Courage.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.891
Kent, you're looking
unusually thoughtful

17:06.893 --> 17:08.393
and silent
for an anchor.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.994

I'd come to terms

17:09.996 --> 17:12.964

Mmm.

Kent, why are you
doing this?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.550
Why did you get
into this business?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.186

17:44.097 --> 17:45.596
Jump on it, hoss,

This is Kent Brockman, saying...

19:16.122 --> 19:17.688
No! I'm gonna sing
Beatles songs

Well, it's funny, actually.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.105
I was trapped
in a burning building...

all the credit for this?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.109

I could trust

Charles Kuralt.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.683
It was a burning building
called my career.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.185
Thank God I had help.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.054
Lisa Simpson, you deserve to be
on this couch with me.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.056
But because I don't lie anymore,

19:52.058 --> 19:54.559
I have to say I didn't fight
too hard when they said no.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.360
Hmm. Is that enough?

19:56.362 --> 19:57.995
Are you kidding?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.498
You got Hollywood's
highest honor:

20:00.500 --> 20:03.134
shared credit, no money.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.241
I've been informed
that this is my last newscast

20:10.243 --> 20:12.009
as anchor of the Channel 6 News.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.812
Before I go, I'd like to get
a few things off my chest.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.648
I've made out
with Kent's daughter.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.050
The grown-up one!

20:19.052 --> 20:20.251
Are you almost through?

20:20.253 --> 20:22.053
In a hurry
to fail again, Kent?!

20:22.055 --> 20:24.522
No, it's just I've been
off the air for six weeks,

20:24.524 --> 20:25.723
and it was torture.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.158
Sometimes I'd watch
Bill O'Reilly

20:27.160 --> 20:29.527
and pretend it was an older,
stupider version of me.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.229
Go ahead. Take your chair.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.598
Do what you do best.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.903
Tonight's lotto numbers:
six, 17, 42,

20:38.905 --> 20:41.005
45 and 83!

20:41.007 --> 20:42.974
I'm back!

20:50.583 --> 20:53.651
