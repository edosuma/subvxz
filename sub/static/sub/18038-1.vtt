00:48.749 --> 00:50.944
I told ya.

00:50.945 --> 00:55.467
A quick tunnel job, then up the
stairs, as pretty as you please.

01:07.910 --> 01:10.404
That's worth over ten
thousand pounds.

01:10.405 --> 01:14.326
- We're gonna be rich!
- Not this time, gentlemen.

01:15.096 --> 01:17.053
Sherlock Holmes!

01:20.384 --> 01:22.069
Watson?

01:23.610 --> 01:25.933
Right you are, Holmes.

01:27.636 --> 01:30.762
Run, Archie, or we'll swing for it!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.945
Don't let those ruffians escape!

01:44.768 --> 01:48.519
I am Inspector Lestrade.
You are under...

01:54.116 --> 01:56.437
There's no escape, my friend.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.811
This will be a pleasure.

02:19.499 --> 02:22.356
- Well done, Watson.
- Are you all right, Holmes?

02:22.357 --> 02:23.787
Quite.

02:23.788 --> 02:26.815
Which is more than I
can say for John Clay,

02:26.816 --> 02:30.305
one of London's least
notorious thieves.

02:30.674 --> 02:34.458
Inspector! I have your man.

02:36.563 --> 02:39.247
Come on.

02:40.521 --> 02:42.241
Well, Mr. Holmes...

02:42.617 --> 02:45.610
I don't know how,
but you've done it again.

02:45.611 --> 02:47.705
Thank you. That's
high praise indeed,

02:47.706 --> 02:51.525
coming from such a workmanlike
detective as yourself.

02:54.227 --> 02:57.651
And now, if you have
nothing further to add,

02:57.652 --> 03:01.112
I hereby declare this case...

03:01.113 --> 03:03.037
closed.

03:04.839 --> 03:07.100
Good! We got kippers for breakfast.

03:07.101 --> 03:09.558
Just a minute.

03:20.507 --> 03:22.269
You idiot!

03:22.270 --> 03:23.700
What?

03:23.701 --> 03:25.228
Confound you!

03:25.229 --> 03:27.824
What... what did I say?

03:27.825 --> 03:30.153
What did I say wrong?

03:30.154 --> 03:34.279
I did everything you said,
exactly as you said it.

04:59.172 --> 05:03.093
All right, what did I do?

05:03.796 --> 05:06.321
You're not going to
tell me, are you?

05:06.790 --> 05:09.716
All right. You want
to know what's wrong?

05:09.717 --> 05:12.944
- I said I did, didn't I?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.870
Don't declare a case is closed...

05:15.871 --> 05:17.900
Just a minute. My public awaits.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.694
until I say it's closed!

05:20.695 --> 05:23.388
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Holmes!

05:23.389 --> 05:25.918
- May we have a word?
- Certainly.

05:25.919 --> 05:29.609
How did you know somebody was
tunneling into the Royal Gallery?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.539
That was very interesting.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.465
There was fresh dirt in
the building next door.

05:34.466 --> 05:36.328
Fresh dirt...

05:36.329 --> 05:39.048
Would you like to
elaborate on that?

05:39.822 --> 05:43.414
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand.

05:43.415 --> 05:47.173
But didn't Scotland Yard
see the very same clues?

05:47.174 --> 05:50.467
I see and observe.

05:50.468 --> 05:53.253
Isn't that rather redundant?

05:58.650 --> 06:01.278
Describe the front
of this building.

06:02.610 --> 06:06.002
Without looking, describe
the front of this house.

06:06.003 --> 06:09.129
Well, it's brick...

06:09.130 --> 06:12.222
it's got black railings, I think,

06:12.223 --> 06:14.817
and windows.

06:15.583 --> 06:19.039
- How many windows?
- How many?

06:21.173 --> 06:22.668
I don't know.

06:22.669 --> 06:26.428
Quite so. He sees, but
he does not observe.

06:26.429 --> 06:29.254
Whereas I see and observe,

06:29.255 --> 06:32.281
and thus bring many notorious
blackguards to justice.

06:32.282 --> 06:34.739
Hear, hear!

06:39.168 --> 06:41.961
Did I put that
reporter in his place?

06:41.962 --> 06:44.250
Just for the record...

06:44.657 --> 06:47.916
how many windows are there
in the front of this building?

06:47.917 --> 06:50.669
I haven't the foggiest idea.

06:53.107 --> 06:56.233
There are fifteen
windows, you fool!

06:56.234 --> 06:58.055
Fifteen!

07:01.057 --> 07:02.913
Not only that...

07:03.851 --> 07:08.308
Not only that, but the reporter
you just embarrassed...

07:08.309 --> 07:11.535
he knows how to type, is
somewhat nearsighted,

07:11.536 --> 07:14.493
and recently returned
from a holiday.

07:15.993 --> 07:18.322
"And how do you know that, Watson?"

07:18.323 --> 07:20.650
Elementary. From the
creases on his wrist

07:20.651 --> 07:23.006
where a typist presses
against the table.

07:24.243 --> 07:27.131
Do you think this is a
good likeness of me?

07:28.935 --> 07:31.095
Wonderful story, by the way,

07:31.096 --> 07:34.255
but on page two, you have
me admitting a mistake.

07:34.256 --> 07:36.617
A writer must write
of which he knows.

07:36.618 --> 07:39.477
Do you think that's
really necessary?

07:39.478 --> 07:42.904
I mean, tarnishing the
image and all that?

07:42.905 --> 07:45.124
Hello.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.029
What have we here?

07:47.030 --> 07:49.282
Something's afoot.

08:02.632 --> 08:06.688
How many times have I told you to
stay away from my experiments?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.409
Something wrong?

08:12.046 --> 08:15.704
I seem to spend an increasing
amount of my precious time

08:15.705 --> 08:19.930
correcting your blunders,
both private and public!

08:19.931 --> 08:22.590
I see. It's the Clay case.

08:22.591 --> 08:25.384
You still in a snit over that?

08:25.385 --> 08:27.547
Well, if you want my opinion...

08:28.413 --> 08:30.708
I beg your pardon?
Opinion, did you say?

08:30.709 --> 08:34.332
Oh, my God. Not that speech again.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.894
May I remind you, for
your information, sir,

08:36.895 --> 08:39.355
that your opinions are my opinions.

08:39.356 --> 08:41.184
Oh, piffle.

08:41.186 --> 08:44.212
I created the character
of Sherlock Holmes,

08:44.214 --> 08:46.906
and hired you merely
to play the part...

08:46.907 --> 08:48.670
snatching you from the gutter.

08:48.671 --> 08:51.597
Hardly the gutter, old boy.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.890
After all, I was once
an actor of note.

08:54.891 --> 08:59.346
Whose last play ran a total of
one-half of one performance.

08:59.548 --> 09:02.209
I'll have you know Shadow of Death

09:02.210 --> 09:04.372
with Reginald Kincaid

09:04.373 --> 09:08.229
was a towering work,
decades ahead of its time.

09:08.230 --> 09:11.358
Lesson number two. Advanced Bowing.

09:11.359 --> 09:16.380
My only regret was that it ended
before the climactic third-act duel.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.175
Too bad you didn't have
a chance to see it.

09:19.176 --> 09:22.169
I've no use for
theatrical swordplay.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.462
All I ask is that you
obey a few simple rules,

09:25.463 --> 09:26.992
not the least of which is,

09:26.993 --> 09:29.720
a case is not closed
until I say it's closed.

09:29.721 --> 09:33.878
I think you underestimate my own
native deductive abilities.

09:33.879 --> 09:36.539
Do you hear those footsteps?

09:36.540 --> 09:38.967
I'd say this was a woman
about five-feet-five,

09:38.968 --> 09:41.229
weight about
twelve-and-a-half stone,

09:41.230 --> 09:43.721
age fifty-four. VoilÃ .

09:49.779 --> 09:51.043
Blown yourself up again?

09:51.044 --> 09:54.768
It's for you... your
Baker Street Irregulars.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.465
Hello, boys.

09:56.466 --> 09:59.626
Wiggins, give it back.

09:59.959 --> 10:02.586
Just tryin' to earn a living.

10:02.587 --> 10:06.042
We heard you was looking
for us, Doctor.

10:09.839 --> 10:12.832
Yes, there's been some trouble

10:12.833 --> 10:15.294
concerning the break-in
at the Royal Gallery.

10:15.295 --> 10:16.791
What?

10:16.792 --> 10:20.484
We heard that Mr. Holmes
declared the case closed.

10:20.485 --> 10:23.278
That will prove, after
some creative writing,

10:23.279 --> 10:25.906
to be merely a ruse
on Mr. Holmes's part.

10:25.907 --> 10:29.964
Something's not right... John Clay
does not deal in works of art.

10:29.965 --> 10:33.258
I need you boys to have a look
around... eyes sharp, ears quick.

10:33.259 --> 10:36.484
A copper apiece for your trouble,
and a shilling for what you learn.

10:36.485 --> 10:39.111
We'll do our best, won't we, lads?

10:39.112 --> 10:42.005
Don't let us keep you, boys.
Come on... out.

10:42.006 --> 10:43.668
Don't worry about a thing.

10:43.669 --> 10:47.057
We know how much you could
use some real assistance.

10:47.562 --> 10:51.380
You're making a laughingstock
of me. How can I be...

10:53.916 --> 10:56.377
How can I be expected
to maintain a character

10:56.378 --> 10:58.805
when you belittle me in
front of those hooligans?

10:58.806 --> 11:01.433
Are we talking of the same
man who once declared

11:01.434 --> 11:03.263
that the late Colonel Howard

11:03.264 --> 11:06.689
had been bludgeoned to death
by a blunt "excrement"?

11:06.690 --> 11:09.584
Is it my fault you have
such poor handwriting?

11:09.585 --> 11:12.045
Anyway, it was just
a little mistake.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.605
He's been at it again.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.030
- I never liked that woman.
- Come in, Mrs. Hudson.

11:19.099 --> 11:22.192
I found it under a loose
board in the stairwell.

11:22.193 --> 11:23.913
Thank you.

11:25.285 --> 11:29.575
An occasional libation enables
me to stiffen my resolve.

11:29.576 --> 11:32.270
Your resolve should
be pickled by now.

11:32.271 --> 11:35.231
I don't believe that either of you
realize what pressure I'm under!

11:35.232 --> 11:38.159
Do you know what it's
like to commit to memory

11:38.160 --> 11:40.619
a never-ending list of
clues and deductions

11:40.620 --> 11:43.646
to be parroted back to
Lestrade and reporters?

11:43.647 --> 11:46.375
Blood stains on a
toothpick? Cigar ash?

11:46.376 --> 11:48.371
New soil in the garden next door?

11:48.372 --> 11:50.199
Endless twaddle!

11:50.200 --> 11:51.963
Twaddle!

11:51.964 --> 11:55.423
Are you referring to the
systematic gathering of evidence

11:55.424 --> 11:58.018
and the logical
deductions based thereon?

11:58.019 --> 12:00.272
I am referring to twaddle!

12:00.713 --> 12:02.775
You would be well served

12:02.776 --> 12:06.268
to include fewer of these dreary
details in future chronicles,

12:06.269 --> 12:08.630
and place greater emphasis on me.

12:08.631 --> 12:12.687
I am, after all, the one the
public really cares about.

12:15.017 --> 12:19.437
Would you be so kind as to
excuse us for a moment?

12:20.572 --> 12:25.220
Careful, Watson! Remember
your blood pressure!

12:25.697 --> 12:29.481
And good riddance to
bad rubbish, I must say.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.744
Am I to understand that
you are giving me notice?

12:34.745 --> 12:37.837
Let's just say that the
curtain has come down

12:37.838 --> 12:41.291
on yet another
miserable performance.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.214
Right.

12:45.088 --> 12:50.268
I was once a figment
of your imagination.

12:52.141 --> 12:58.127
But now, Sherlock Holmes
belongs to the whole world.

13:03.585 --> 13:07.576
At last we're free of
that ungrateful baggage!

13:07.577 --> 13:11.860
From now on, things are gonna be
much more pleasant around here.

13:14.131 --> 13:16.849
An actor?!

13:17.390 --> 13:20.416
Nothing the matter, nothing at all.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.711
Back to work.

13:22.712 --> 13:25.636
Hold my calls.

13:30.131 --> 13:33.019
We'll start at the beginning...

13:33.724 --> 13:35.254
shall we?

13:35.255 --> 13:37.449
It was about nine years ago.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.376
One of my patients was a
Scotland Yard inspector

13:40.377 --> 13:42.904
investigating the
Paxton murder case.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.032
I gave him the name
of the murderer,

13:45.033 --> 13:48.488
but gave credit to a
nonexistent detective.

13:49.492 --> 13:51.919
At the time, I was hoping
for an appointment

13:51.920 --> 13:55.478
to the staff of a rather
conservative medical college.

13:55.479 --> 13:57.874
I knew that they'd
frown on my little...

13:57.875 --> 14:00.301
- Hobby?
- Exactly.

14:00.302 --> 14:02.697
Well, I didn't get the appointment.

14:02.698 --> 14:05.890
Instead, what I got was a quite
unanticipated public demand

14:05.891 --> 14:07.488
to meet this Sherlock Holmes.

14:07.489 --> 14:12.277
So you hired this Reginald Kincaid.

14:12.278 --> 14:13.742
He was an actor.

14:13.743 --> 14:16.967
Unfortunately, he was also
a gambler, a womanizer,

14:16.968 --> 14:18.697
and a drunkard.

14:18.698 --> 14:22.158
John, you have jeopardized the
integrity of English literature.

14:22.159 --> 14:25.018
Still, I should have known.

14:25.019 --> 14:28.478
He was always borrowing
large sums of money off me

14:28.479 --> 14:30.939
and never paying me back.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.569
The cad.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.730
Don't worry. We deducted
it from your royalties.

14:35.864 --> 14:39.818
- Who else knows of this?
- No one.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.281
Except Mrs. Hudson
and the Irregulars.

14:43.282 --> 14:46.075
But it's time now for the
public to learn the truth.

14:46.076 --> 14:48.295
The truth?

14:48.537 --> 14:50.223
Certainly.

14:50.966 --> 14:53.028
No one will want to read
of that twit again.

14:53.029 --> 14:54.691
His popularity will plummet.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.053
They'll be desperate
for my new creation.

14:57.054 --> 14:58.849
What new creation?

14:58.850 --> 15:01.172
John Watson, the Crime Doctor!

15:02.242 --> 15:05.166
I could have it ready for
your very next issue.

15:06.103 --> 15:07.992
Sit down, John.

15:14.019 --> 15:16.248
People buy the Strand magazine

15:16.249 --> 15:19.076
expecting to read a story
in which Sherlock Holmes

15:19.077 --> 15:23.532
solves the case, not
the Crime Surgeon.

15:23.533 --> 15:24.796
Crime Doctor.

15:24.797 --> 15:27.724
Crime Doctor, Crime
Surgeon, Crime Dentist...

15:27.725 --> 15:29.687
who cares, really?

15:29.688 --> 15:31.117
Let's face it, John,

15:31.118 --> 15:33.712
Sherlock Holmes is worth a
fortune to the magazine.

15:33.713 --> 15:36.000
You're stuck with him.

15:36.773 --> 15:40.464
Norman, I'll write what I want.
There's nothing you can do.

15:40.465 --> 15:42.719
The devil there isn't.

15:45.522 --> 15:47.615
You can't go in there!

15:47.616 --> 15:48.681
What is this?

15:48.682 --> 15:52.506
Sorry, Doctor, but we found
something. Down by the docks.

15:52.507 --> 15:54.170
- Excellent!
- Hello, ducks.

15:54.171 --> 15:56.332
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.729
Do you work here?

15:57.730 --> 15:59.958
Watson, I'm warning you...

15:59.959 --> 16:03.185
it's Sherlock Holmes, or we'll sue
you for everything you're worth!

16:03.186 --> 16:06.868
And I mean everything!

16:09.106 --> 16:12.030
Anyone seen my watch?

16:15.595 --> 16:17.956
- There it is.
- Camden Paper Mill.

16:17.957 --> 16:20.750
Burned about four this morning.

16:20.751 --> 16:23.844
- Same time as the Clay robbery.
- On the button.

16:23.845 --> 16:26.337
Good lad! Now we're
getting somewhere.

16:26.338 --> 16:28.034
Let's take a look around.

16:28.035 --> 16:30.163
Went up like a torch, they say.

16:30.164 --> 16:35.116
Well, it's full of wood
pulp and paper, you see?

16:35.753 --> 16:39.012
I'm sorry, sir. No one's
allowed in this area.

16:39.013 --> 16:41.907
Quite all right, I assure you.
I'm Dr. John Watson.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.870
Nobody's sick here.

16:43.871 --> 16:46.826
You don't understand.

16:48.293 --> 16:51.453
- John Watson.
- The Crime Doctor.

16:51.454 --> 16:55.011
That's right. John Watson,
the Crime Doctor.

16:55.012 --> 16:58.571
Crime Doctor? Never heard of him.

16:58.572 --> 17:02.595
Though your name
sounds a bit familiar.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.693
All right.

17:04.694 --> 17:07.421
I am Dr. John Watson...

17:07.422 --> 17:11.046
author of the Sherlock
Holmes mysteries.

17:16.005 --> 17:18.098
The Sherlock Holmes?

17:20.960 --> 17:24.986
Me and the wife has read
every one of his stories.

17:24.987 --> 17:27.480
All right. Now, if
you'll excuse me...

17:27.481 --> 17:32.170
I'm sorry, I still can't let you in.
Strict orders about that, I'm afraid.

17:32.171 --> 17:37.261
But Mr. Holmes...
did he send you here?

17:37.560 --> 17:39.882
He certainly did not!

17:41.387 --> 17:45.311
Well, perhaps the next time you
should check with him first.

17:45.312 --> 17:48.098
Save yourself a trip.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.030
You try and fight
crime in this city,

17:52.031 --> 17:54.857
and all you hear about
is Sherlock Holmes!

17:54.858 --> 17:57.851
"What's he like? When
will you see him next?"

17:57.852 --> 18:00.345
Never, that's when! Never!

18:00.346 --> 18:02.873
Doctor, dear, keep your voice down.

18:02.874 --> 18:06.634
- Why should I?
- Because you have visitors.

18:06.635 --> 18:10.293
Inspector Lestrade and
a Lord Smithwick.

18:18.245 --> 18:20.996
Of the Treasury?

18:29.621 --> 18:31.949
Gentlemen, won't you come up?

18:31.950 --> 18:35.841
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
Mr. Holmes is in, is he?

18:35.842 --> 18:38.602
Dr. Watson will see you,

18:38.603 --> 18:43.159
although he is quite busy
with his scholarly pursuits.

18:48.017 --> 18:49.907
Gentlemen.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.597
Good afternoon, Inspector.

18:56.598 --> 18:58.127
This is Lord Smithwick,

18:58.128 --> 19:00.955
Her Majesty's Chancellor
of the Exchequer.

19:00.956 --> 19:02.219
My pleasure, sir.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.747
His Lordship wishes
to see Mr. Holmes.

19:04.748 --> 19:07.510
I'm sorry to say he's
not here at the moment.

19:07.511 --> 19:10.337
Oh, how disappointing!

19:10.338 --> 19:12.898
As I said before,
I really don't think

19:12.899 --> 19:15.926
Mr. Holmes's involvement
in this case is necessary.

19:15.927 --> 19:18.553
- I quite agree.
- You do?

19:18.554 --> 19:21.680
However, the Crime Doctor
is at your disposal.

19:21.681 --> 19:23.844
Who the deuce is the Crime Doctor?

19:23.845 --> 19:26.038
What?

19:26.039 --> 19:30.163
Most amusing, but this is a
matter of the gravest urgency.

19:30.164 --> 19:32.392
When do you expect Mr. Holmes?

19:32.393 --> 19:35.951
Not for a while. He's out of town.

19:35.952 --> 19:38.380
Good afternoon.

19:38.381 --> 19:40.441
Well...

19:41.076 --> 19:42.705
too bad.

19:42.706 --> 19:46.230
I'm sure we'll be able to get along
quite well without Mr. Holmes.

19:46.231 --> 19:47.628
Wait!

19:47.629 --> 19:50.222
Today's Friday, isn't it?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.319
Of course it is. Silly me.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.945
Holmes is supposed
to be back tonight.

19:54.946 --> 19:57.142
How fortunate.

19:57.143 --> 20:00.633
Very well. We shall
return at seven tonight.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.529
Come along, Inspector.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.359
Till then, gentlemen.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.950
- We've made this trip for nothing.
- I must ask you once again...

20:12.244 --> 20:14.274
Where did you get that hat?

20:14.275 --> 20:16.967
Where did you get that tile?

20:16.968 --> 20:21.292
Isn't it a knobby one?
It's just the proper style

20:21.293 --> 20:25.750
I would like to have one
just the same as that

20:25.751 --> 20:27.945
Where'er I go, they shout Hello!

20:27.946 --> 20:30.307
And where'd you get that hat?

20:30.308 --> 20:34.366
Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.763
Good evening.

20:35.764 --> 20:38.657
Have you seen Peter Bright?
He's disappeared.

20:38.658 --> 20:41.183
Hello, Connie.

20:44.147 --> 20:46.637
All right...

20:47.540 --> 20:49.701
Who did it?

20:50.202 --> 20:53.626
Come on... which one
of ya pinched me?

20:53.627 --> 20:56.055
- Pinched, you say?
- That's right.

20:56.056 --> 21:00.271
May I be of... some assistance?

21:00.946 --> 21:04.866
The name is Holmes...
Sherlock Holmes.

21:06.500 --> 21:10.125
Constance Peyton, sir.
Pleased to meet ya.

21:10.126 --> 21:11.524
Charmed.

21:11.525 --> 21:14.252
Now, let's see...

21:14.253 --> 21:18.309
By careful observation of the
patrons of these premises,

21:18.310 --> 21:21.702
I have been able to
deduce the identity

21:21.703 --> 21:25.091
of the fiend who pinched you.

21:25.695 --> 21:28.448
Me. Did it again!

21:31.716 --> 21:34.470
- Thank you, my good man.
- Thank you, sir.

21:39.934 --> 21:42.096
I'll make this brief.

21:42.428 --> 21:45.055
I'll make this brief.

21:47.485 --> 21:50.944
I'll need to see some money.
It's been five days now.

21:50.945 --> 21:54.136
- Now, see here, my good man...
- Go ahead, sir, it's on me.

21:54.137 --> 21:56.425
Thank you, sir.

22:00.990 --> 22:03.483
- How are things?
- Couldn't be better.

22:03.484 --> 22:04.548
Good health.

22:04.549 --> 22:06.743
I'll meke this braif.

22:06.744 --> 22:09.671
I'll make this brief...
I want you to come back.

22:09.672 --> 22:12.400
Like I predicted... you need me.

22:12.401 --> 22:13.995
I do not need you.

22:13.996 --> 22:16.226
Then what are you here for?
I didn't call for you.

22:16.227 --> 22:18.719
All right, I need you...
for this one blasted time.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.179
One time, and that's all? You're
gonna have to do better than that.

22:22.180 --> 22:25.040
Don't push me. You've
already run out of money.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.435
This is because you lack
the necessary skills

22:27.436 --> 22:29.530
to gain decent employment.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.091
Wrong, Watson.

22:33.092 --> 22:36.484
I have been honing my ability
of elementary deduction

22:36.485 --> 22:38.513
to a razor's edge... observe.

22:38.514 --> 22:40.343
Excuse me, sir.

22:40.344 --> 22:42.604
How are things on the subcontinent?

22:42.605 --> 22:44.169
I beg your pardon?

22:44.170 --> 22:47.421
You are a reporter just back
from India, are you not?

22:47.696 --> 22:50.622
I'm a barrister, and I've never
been to India in my life.

22:50.623 --> 22:53.616
- But you do read the Times.
- Of course.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.612
There you have it.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.242
My card.

23:01.401 --> 23:04.792
I'll ask you just once more.
Are you coming with me or not?

23:04.793 --> 23:08.120
I would rather waltz naked
through the fires of hell.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.314
I can see coming
here was a mistake.

23:10.315 --> 23:14.837
Excellent deduction.
Keep up the good work.

23:18.899 --> 23:22.156
Gentlemen. And what
can I do for you?

23:22.157 --> 23:24.719
A mystery to be solved?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.315
You might say that.

23:26.316 --> 23:29.142
There's a little matter
of a gambling debt.

23:29.143 --> 23:32.503
The mystery is why
you ain't paid it.

23:32.504 --> 23:36.728
Gentlemen, you are dealing
with Sherlock Holmes,

23:36.729 --> 23:39.622
a man of honor and
character beyond reproach.

23:39.623 --> 23:41.085
There he is!

23:41.086 --> 23:44.246
That's the bloke who
pinched me bum!

23:47.341 --> 23:50.025
Pardon me! Pardon me!

23:50.434 --> 23:52.858
Excuse me, luv.

24:00.914 --> 24:04.869
- Didn't I say seven o'clock?
- Forgive me for being late.

24:04.870 --> 24:08.325
Is Mr. Holmes with you?

24:09.693 --> 24:12.487
Well, actually, Lord Smithwick,

24:12.488 --> 24:15.414
a short time ago I received
a wire from Holmes

24:15.415 --> 24:17.810
instructing me to
take down the details

24:17.811 --> 24:22.268
and begin the investigation...
without him, as it were.

24:22.269 --> 24:24.630
- What?
- Believe it or not,

24:24.631 --> 24:27.847
I am every bit Holmes's
equal as a detective.

24:29.554 --> 24:33.079
I happen to know that you recently
recovered from an illness,

24:33.080 --> 24:36.905
that you smoke a pipe...
probably rosewood...

24:36.906 --> 24:39.067
and you spent time in China.

24:39.068 --> 24:41.695
This is no time for parlor games.

24:41.696 --> 24:45.084
This is a matter for professionals.

24:45.389 --> 24:47.615
You gotta help me!
There's two big men...

24:47.616 --> 24:50.244
You're back! So good to see you!

24:50.245 --> 24:54.236
Isn't this a clever disguise?
A drunken lout... very realistic.

24:54.237 --> 24:58.196
This woman said I
pinched her bottom...

24:58.197 --> 25:01.186
Pinched her bum! Ha ha!

25:10.337 --> 25:14.463
Gentlemen... Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

25:21.315 --> 25:25.202
It's good to see the department is
letting you out at night again.

25:27.935 --> 25:30.030
Trouble at the Exchequer?

25:30.031 --> 25:31.760
Well, to be honest...

25:31.761 --> 25:35.046
Wait... how did you know?

25:35.586 --> 25:37.981
The same way that I can tell
you've recently recovered

25:37.982 --> 25:41.707
from an illness, smoke a pipe...
probably rosewood...

25:41.708 --> 25:44.102
- and have spent some time in...
- China.

25:44.103 --> 25:46.797
Amazing!

25:46.798 --> 25:49.084
Thank you.

25:50.854 --> 25:54.208
Before we start, perhaps
a little sherry?

25:54.582 --> 25:56.344
I wish we could,

25:56.345 --> 25:58.372
but the matter which brings me here

25:58.373 --> 26:02.098
involves the fate of
the entire Empire.

26:02.099 --> 26:05.192
I see. Perhaps a whiskey, then?

26:05.592 --> 26:06.922
Perhaps later.

26:06.923 --> 26:09.316
Tell me the details,
and omit nothing.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.676
- Watson, pay close attention.
- Do you know what these are?

26:12.677 --> 26:14.472
- I do.
- So do I.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.268
Plates for the Bank of
England's five pound note.

26:17.269 --> 26:19.630
- Undoubtedly.
- Or very good imitations.

26:19.631 --> 26:21.325
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

26:21.326 --> 26:22.391
Indeed.

26:22.392 --> 26:25.676
That's cleared that up.
How about that whiskey?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.805
- May I?
- I suppose so.

26:32.503 --> 26:35.264
Just two nights ago,
these clever forgeries

26:35.265 --> 26:38.058
were exchanged for
the genuine plates.

26:38.059 --> 26:41.219
If the real plates are in the
hands of some foreign power...

26:41.220 --> 26:43.315
Or someone even more treacherous,

26:43.316 --> 26:46.342
the kingdom could find itself
awash in counterfeit notes.

26:46.343 --> 26:50.831
And I don't have to tell
you what that would mean.

26:52.830 --> 26:55.015
Yes, you do.

26:55.391 --> 26:59.283
It would mean, quite simply,
economic ruin for England.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.476
Nobody would know which
five pound notes were real

27:02.477 --> 27:04.469
and which weren't.

27:06.235 --> 27:11.085
Gentlemen, I accept this case.

27:11.224 --> 27:14.483
My fee will be five
hundred pounds...

27:14.484 --> 27:16.975
payable in ten pound notes.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.735
Good evening.

27:23.899 --> 27:26.958
We can all rest a little
easier now, Inspector.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.654
Drive on, my good man.

27:28.655 --> 27:30.983
I don't suppose it would
make any difference

27:30.984 --> 27:34.909
if I said I have grave
doubts about Mr. Holmes.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.473
I must confess,

27:36.474 --> 27:41.154
I feel a bit prouder knowing
Sherlock Holmes is British.

27:45.421 --> 27:48.480
Do you suppose he took
the case, Professor?

27:51.343 --> 27:53.371
Watson?

27:55.933 --> 27:58.694
My dear boy, how could he resist?

27:58.695 --> 28:01.587
This is working out so very well.

28:01.588 --> 28:03.649
Driver.

28:24.110 --> 28:26.969
Gentlemen... I am here.

28:26.970 --> 28:30.323
Mr. Holmes, at last!

28:31.062 --> 28:34.421
Welcome to Her
Majesty's Royal Mint.

28:34.422 --> 28:38.347
This is one of my long-time
employees, Mister...

28:38.348 --> 28:40.443
- Hadlers, sir.
- Hadlers, yes.

28:40.444 --> 28:43.602
Inspector Lestrade was
inquiring about the vaults.

28:43.603 --> 28:47.989
It's my guess that it's an inside
job by someone with a key.

28:48.293 --> 28:52.349
You have a key, don't you, Hadlers?

28:52.951 --> 28:54.479
Me? No!

28:54.480 --> 28:57.608
Inspector, please. Mr.
Holmes will take over now.

28:57.609 --> 28:59.536
It's quite all right.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.200
As a matter of fact, Lestrade,

29:01.201 --> 29:03.461
- you can be of some help.
- Of course.

29:03.462 --> 29:07.349
Hold my coat. It's hot in here.

29:11.146 --> 29:14.670
So this is where the
printing plates are kept.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.121
Very interesting...

29:25.352 --> 29:27.412
No harm done.

29:27.413 --> 29:32.170
Tell me, how many people
have access to this vault?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.031
Three persons only...

29:34.032 --> 29:36.961
myself, the Commissioner
for Seals and Engravings,

29:36.962 --> 29:39.854
and the printing
supervisor, Peter Giles.

29:39.855 --> 29:42.516
I should like to speak to
this, uh, third person.

29:42.517 --> 29:45.733
He didn't turn up for
work this morning.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.102
We've already done some
checking on this Giles.

29:49.103 --> 29:52.596
He is a widower, with
one child named Leslie.

29:52.597 --> 29:55.024
I've seen her once
or twice, myself.

29:55.025 --> 30:00.014
A very pretty girl, in
an unusual sort of way.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.108
- Pretty?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite.

30:03.109 --> 30:06.234
Watson, make a note of that.

30:06.235 --> 30:09.794
Though Mr. Giles himself
seemed slightly uncomfortable

30:09.795 --> 30:13.510
when I complimented him
on her appearance.

30:14.885 --> 30:18.940
Surely you can't believe that
Peter Giles was involved!

30:18.941 --> 30:21.869
The man's worked here
for over thirty years,

30:21.870 --> 30:25.128
and he was very religious, too.
Wouldn't you say so, uh...

30:25.129 --> 30:26.392
Hadlers, sir.

30:26.393 --> 30:28.987
Oh, yes. He was always
quoting from the Psalms.

30:28.988 --> 30:32.347
The Psalms... one of
my favorite books.

30:32.348 --> 30:35.439
The... Bible, wasn't it?

30:37.238 --> 30:40.730
I suppose you'll want to
speak to this Peter Giles.

30:40.731 --> 30:44.447
I've never been one for
religious talk, myself.

30:44.757 --> 30:47.916
On the other hand, no
leads must be overlooked.

30:47.917 --> 30:49.546
You can rest assured,
your Lordship,

30:49.547 --> 30:53.762
we shall be investigating
the daughter, as well.

30:54.172 --> 30:55.865
I must be going.

30:55.866 --> 31:00.091
Come here! You ninny, what
are you doing over there?

31:00.092 --> 31:02.620
Amazing fellow, really.

31:02.621 --> 31:05.645
All right, now go! Go!

31:10.005 --> 31:11.725
Open this door!

31:12.533 --> 31:15.318
Giles, open the door.
It's Sherlock Holmes.

31:15.926 --> 31:18.485
Stand back, I'll break it down.

31:25.805 --> 31:28.467
Half a tick, Mr. Holmes.

31:33.989 --> 31:36.849
You can't go walking into
someone's residence,

31:36.850 --> 31:39.509
pokin' about their
personal possessions,

31:39.510 --> 31:42.297
disturbin' their privacy.

31:44.435 --> 31:47.255
That's for Scotland Yard.

31:49.060 --> 31:51.720
Anybody home?

31:54.215 --> 31:55.810
Nobody home.

31:55.811 --> 31:59.165
- You're treading on the mat.
- Sorry.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.196
Nice, tidy little place.

32:03.197 --> 32:05.392
- A French postcard.
- Really?

32:05.393 --> 32:07.288
I knew a chap who
collected these once.

32:07.289 --> 32:10.143
He had this wonderful
one of two women...

32:10.415 --> 32:14.207
- Oh. It's just the Eiffel Tower.
- Quite a bit of correspondence there.

32:14.208 --> 32:17.526
I'd say Giles hadn't been
home for several days.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.526
Anything of interest in that card?

32:20.527 --> 32:23.686
It says, "Having a gay time
here, but need a holiday.

32:23.687 --> 32:26.048
Will see you on Monday. L."

32:26.049 --> 32:29.908
I wonder who that can be?

32:29.909 --> 32:32.667
"L"... is that an old friend?
A secret lover?

32:32.668 --> 32:35.064
It's my guess it's
his daughter Leslie.

32:35.065 --> 32:37.885
I'll wager you're right.

32:40.221 --> 32:42.647
That's right... let him
deduce everything.

32:42.648 --> 32:46.242
When Lestrade returns, go
about your sleuthing routine.

32:46.243 --> 32:47.637
The full treatment?

32:47.638 --> 32:51.098
Whatever it takes to keep him
occupied while I look around.

32:51.099 --> 32:54.790
It would appear as if Mr.
Giles has taken a holiday.

32:54.791 --> 32:57.849
I expected no less.

33:00.713 --> 33:03.102
If you'll allow me.

33:12.389 --> 33:15.981
- Very interesting up here.
- Excuse me.

33:32.647 --> 33:35.400
My word.

33:37.937 --> 33:39.658
Don't touch that!

33:42.793 --> 33:45.022
There may be fingerprints.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.977
The book of Psalms...

33:49.679 --> 33:53.204
As I anticipated... the Bible.

33:53.205 --> 33:57.761
All starting to fit together
rather neatly, I'd say.

34:07.743 --> 34:10.630
Stay with me, Lestrade.

34:11.235 --> 34:15.193
Investigating crime calls for
the searching out of patterns.

34:15.194 --> 34:18.387
Now, take the patterns
in this carpet.

34:18.388 --> 34:21.911
Rosettes and what
appears to be cherubs.

34:21.913 --> 34:24.576
Is that a cherub?

34:29.033 --> 34:30.960
What have you there?

34:30.962 --> 34:32.824
Oh, this.

34:32.824 --> 34:35.052
I just found this in the fireplace.

34:35.053 --> 34:37.714
Careful. Might be evidence.

34:37.715 --> 34:39.899
Really?

34:40.243 --> 34:43.870
"E-R-M-E-R-E."

34:44.168 --> 34:46.694
What do you make of it?

34:48.592 --> 34:52.518
Are you blind, Lestrade?
Tell him, Watson.

34:52.518 --> 34:54.614
Correct me if I'm wrong,

34:54.614 --> 34:57.933
but this piece of paper
is part of a map.

34:58.673 --> 35:00.767
A location.

35:02.165 --> 35:04.194
Emere...

35:04.195 --> 35:07.185
Cashmere...

35:11.480 --> 35:14.406
Windermere! Lake Windermere!

35:14.407 --> 35:15.903
Brilliant!

35:15.904 --> 35:18.996
The lake district is a
perfect place to hide.

35:18.997 --> 35:21.359
Nobody goes there
this time of year.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.221
We'll wire Windermere

35:23.222 --> 35:25.916
and see if Giles has
made his appearance yet.

35:25.917 --> 35:28.676
And don't you worry, Mr. Holmes...

35:28.677 --> 35:32.857
we'll have this case
wrapped up in no time.

35:36.229 --> 35:37.426
Unique, actually.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.520
- So much for the great detective!
- Very creative, Watson.

35:40.521 --> 35:43.979
Something that would never have
occurred to the likes of me.

35:43.980 --> 35:47.271
Imagine... a Sherlock
Holmes adventure

35:47.272 --> 35:51.489
in which Lestrade
solves the bloody case!

35:51.930 --> 35:53.660
Calm yourself.

35:53.661 --> 35:57.218
There's a healthy chunk of
mystery yet to be solved.

35:57.219 --> 35:59.314
It's to Windermere for us,

35:59.315 --> 36:01.193
where, I assure you,
the game is still afoot.

36:01.194 --> 36:03.699
Where, I assure you,
the game is still afoot.

36:16.846 --> 36:19.939
"As was his habit, Sherlock Holmes

36:19.940 --> 36:23.757
sat in the railway carriage,
lost in thought."

36:25.295 --> 36:27.752
You must be a millionaire...

36:36.407 --> 36:38.634
Are you Sherlock Holmes?

36:38.635 --> 36:42.159
I am indeed, madam.
Would you like my autograph?

36:43.957 --> 36:47.117
You put me old man
in jail, you did!

36:47.118 --> 36:50.842
"From these moments of
quiet, intense reflection

36:50.843 --> 36:53.074
"would inevitably spring

36:53.075 --> 36:56.532
some new insight."

36:56.533 --> 36:59.526
Stop it, you silly girl!

36:59.527 --> 37:01.949
Go on back!

37:07.543 --> 37:10.102
Sorry about that.

37:16.226 --> 37:19.351
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

37:19.818 --> 37:21.215
Right.

37:21.216 --> 37:24.502
I'm gonna think, too.

37:30.130 --> 37:32.983
What shall we think about?

38:08.053 --> 38:10.215
Allow me to introduce myself.

38:10.216 --> 38:14.372
I am the Right Honorable
Gerald Fitzwalter Johnson,

38:14.373 --> 38:16.626
Lord Mayor.

38:18.765 --> 38:21.425
This is my daughter Christabel.

38:22.324 --> 38:24.053
Hello, Mr. Holmes.

38:24.054 --> 38:27.312
We're enthusiastic readers of
your articles in the Strand.

38:27.313 --> 38:31.959
My daughter, in particular,
reads each one several times.

38:32.236 --> 38:35.097
Don't even think about it.

38:35.098 --> 38:37.557
I believe we have
something for you.

38:37.558 --> 38:42.706
A man matching Mr. Giles's
description arrived two nights ago.

38:43.580 --> 38:47.205
This is Andrews, a dock
worker here on the lake.

38:47.206 --> 38:49.301
He remembers the man quite well.

38:49.302 --> 38:52.594
Andrews, this is Mr. Holmes,
come to our fair community

38:52.595 --> 38:55.390
to investigate a matter
of great importance.

38:55.391 --> 38:58.142
You may begin, Mr. Holmes.

39:01.045 --> 39:07.756
What makes you remember this
man so clearly, Mr. Andrews?

39:09.961 --> 39:12.781
- I remember this man...
- Your hat.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.914
I remember this man so clearly

39:15.915 --> 39:19.274
because he was carrying
a brown leather suitcase.

39:19.275 --> 39:24.065
The suitcase was fastened to his
wrist with a pair of silver handcuffs.

39:24.066 --> 39:25.994
It was very heavy,

39:25.995 --> 39:29.449
and he commented on the
weight several times.

39:29.818 --> 39:33.278
- He asked Donald Ayers...
- A local boatman.

39:33.279 --> 39:37.169
a local boatman, to transport
him across the lake

39:37.170 --> 39:40.762
to a cottage he had rented.

39:49.213 --> 39:51.398
Make a note of that.

40:03.551 --> 40:06.710
I'm sure Holmes would like
to speak to this boatman,

40:06.711 --> 40:08.308
Donald Ayers.

40:08.309 --> 40:09.838
Yes, indeed.

40:09.839 --> 40:13.064
The thing of it is, no
one has seen the fellow

40:13.065 --> 40:16.158
or the man with the
suitcase since that night.

40:16.159 --> 40:18.520
You mean they've gone missing?

40:18.521 --> 40:22.313
My theory, if you'll
permit me, is this...

40:22.314 --> 40:24.907
the storm may have
done both of them in.

40:24.908 --> 40:28.533
- They went out in a storm?
- Watson, please.

40:29.697 --> 40:32.052
They went out in a storm?

40:32.824 --> 40:36.313
The lake can get very rough
at this time of the year.

40:37.382 --> 40:43.162
Here we are, our finest hotel...
the Shakespeare Arms.

40:47.628 --> 40:50.920
We're all so proud
to have you here.

40:50.921 --> 40:53.947
The duke's absolutely
beside himself.

40:53.948 --> 40:57.302
- The duke?
- Uh, the d-o-g.

40:59.071 --> 41:03.423
- Sherlock Holmes and Doctor...?
- John Watson.

41:04.827 --> 41:07.054
Now, if you'll just follow me,

41:07.055 --> 41:10.014
I'll have your luggage
taken upstairs.

41:10.015 --> 41:13.233
Stay down, now! Sit, boy, sit!

41:14.041 --> 41:16.900
Now, then, Dukie,
you stay down here

41:16.901 --> 41:19.859
while I take the
gentlemen upstairs.

41:20.428 --> 41:23.620
He's taken quite a fancy to you.

41:23.621 --> 41:26.680
He doesn't like
everybody, you know.

41:30.275 --> 41:32.029
Fetch!

41:32.504 --> 41:35.561
What he likes is the summer,

41:35.562 --> 41:38.520
with all them ramblers!

41:40.552 --> 41:46.265
The King Lear Room...
the finest we've got.

41:50.034 --> 41:52.494
Yours is upstairs, Doctor.

41:52.495 --> 41:55.688
Be careful of the carpet...
the mice have been at it.

41:55.689 --> 41:58.716
We call this the Hamlet Room,

41:58.717 --> 42:03.602
and it does have a
lovely view of the lake.

42:03.806 --> 42:06.733
Now, if you'll excuse me, Doctor...

42:06.734 --> 42:08.296
Watson.

42:08.297 --> 42:13.782
I'll just go and see if
Mr. Holmes is all right.

42:45.786 --> 42:48.846
Would you mind swapping
rooms with me?

42:48.847 --> 42:51.308
I once played King Lear,
and, quite frankly,

42:51.309 --> 42:55.033
that room would revive
memories of rotten fruit.

42:55.034 --> 42:57.296
One room's the same
as another to me.

42:57.297 --> 42:59.253
Thank you.

43:04.549 --> 43:06.743
What a dreary place this is.

43:06.744 --> 43:10.303
Excuse me, but you are
Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?

43:10.304 --> 43:11.634
That depends.

43:11.635 --> 43:14.760
Do you have a relative who
was recently sent to prison?

43:14.761 --> 43:16.890
Me? Why, no.

43:16.891 --> 43:19.750
Yes, then. I am Sherlock Holmes.

43:19.751 --> 43:23.310
We could all consider it an honor
if you'd have a drink with us.

43:23.311 --> 43:25.563
A drink.

43:25.839 --> 43:28.433
I was just saying to my
good friend Dr. Watson here

43:28.434 --> 43:31.889
what a lovely village this is.

43:42.239 --> 43:44.267
I'll have a double whiskey.

43:44.268 --> 43:46.762
Just to ward off the
chill of the evening.

43:46.763 --> 43:49.756
A double whiskey for
Mr. Holmes, please.

43:49.757 --> 43:53.814
A toast... to the greatest
detective in all the world.

43:53.815 --> 43:56.110
Thank you, gentlemen. I am touched.

43:56.111 --> 43:58.072
I can vouch for that.

43:58.073 --> 44:00.468
You remind me of someone
I once encountered

44:00.469 --> 44:03.893
during the curious affair
of the Manchurian Mambo.

44:03.894 --> 44:06.384
Could I have a word?

44:08.651 --> 44:11.910
I believe that was the
Manchurian Mamba.

44:11.911 --> 44:14.106
Mamba, mambo...
what's the difference?

44:14.107 --> 44:16.768
Very little, other than one
is a deadly poisonous snake,

44:16.769 --> 44:20.722
and the other is a rather
festive Caribbean dance.

44:21.060 --> 44:25.817
It was a night just like any other,
when someone knocked at the door.

44:25.818 --> 44:28.811
I opened it, and there
were these Manchurians

44:28.812 --> 44:31.771
doing this rather festive
Caribbean dance.

44:31.772 --> 44:35.196
Manchurian Mambo...

44:35.197 --> 44:37.791
Steady, Watson.

44:38.790 --> 44:41.051
Just get through it one more time,

44:41.052 --> 44:43.346
then you're rid of the fellow.

44:43.347 --> 44:46.235
What a pleasant thought.

44:47.339 --> 44:49.700
I feel much better.

44:49.701 --> 44:51.264
Quite euphoric!

44:51.265 --> 44:53.692
as the snake struck at me,

44:53.693 --> 44:55.787
I danced out of the way.

44:55.788 --> 44:59.513
And if it hadn't been for
my flawless footwork,

44:59.514 --> 45:03.401
I'd be standing here
a dead man today.

45:04.803 --> 45:07.530
What about another drink?

45:07.531 --> 45:13.381
I have to be up early tomorrow,
and I need all my wits about me.

45:14.318 --> 45:16.640
Perhaps just one more.

45:24.631 --> 45:28.347
Holmes, sweet Holmes.

45:38.801 --> 45:42.687
You're not the Hound of the
Baskervilles, you know.

45:59.658 --> 46:03.215
Fresh air... that's what I need.

46:13.730 --> 46:15.983
That's better.

46:29.898 --> 46:31.584
Help!

46:37.416 --> 46:39.703
Help me!

46:40.044 --> 46:42.706
Watson, wake up!

46:47.926 --> 46:51.881
Help!

46:52.284 --> 46:54.139
My God!

46:57.574 --> 47:00.293
Hang on, I'm coming!

47:01.299 --> 47:03.028
Hang on, here I am!

47:03.029 --> 47:04.792
Quickly!

47:04.793 --> 47:06.887
Give me your hand.

47:06.888 --> 47:09.516
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.

47:10.115 --> 47:11.578
Well done.

47:11.579 --> 47:15.362
Pull, quickly! Pull harder!

47:17.301 --> 47:19.463
Don't let go!

47:20.993 --> 47:22.748
Well done.

47:23.389 --> 47:24.584
Jolly good.

47:24.585 --> 47:26.305
Oh, shit!

47:28.944 --> 47:32.669
Fascinating... this railing appears
to have been cut by someone.

47:32.670 --> 47:34.458
Get him off!

47:49.134 --> 47:51.230
Good morning, gentlemen.

47:52.961 --> 47:56.187
This is the cottage Giles leased
from a company in London.

47:56.188 --> 47:58.115
Allow me to show you the way.

47:58.116 --> 48:01.109
Mr. Mayor, don't move!

48:01.110 --> 48:03.572
Not until Mr. Holmes
has had a chance

48:03.573 --> 48:05.934
to inspect the area for clues.

48:05.935 --> 48:08.428
By God, I've trained
you well, Watson.

48:08.429 --> 48:12.180
Now follow me closely.

48:18.076 --> 48:21.498
- What am I looking for?
- Footprints.

48:22.934 --> 48:24.330
Right.

48:24.331 --> 48:27.590
- Have I found any yet?
- No, not yet.

48:27.591 --> 48:30.774
Let me know when I do.

48:40.465 --> 48:44.023
Hello? Anyone at home?

48:54.368 --> 48:58.128
If Giles was headed here...

48:58.129 --> 49:01.220
it's obvious he never arrived.

49:03.317 --> 49:07.135
They've found Donald Ayers.

49:07.443 --> 49:09.628
Who?

49:13.630 --> 49:16.024
Dreadful!

49:16.025 --> 49:19.016
Stand back, lads. Leave it to me.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.811
Constable, please.

49:22.812 --> 49:25.006
Not until Mr. Holmes
has had a chance

49:25.007 --> 49:28.167
to investigate the body for clues.

49:47.927 --> 49:50.321
Yes...

49:50.322 --> 49:53.448
it is my opinion that he is dead.

49:53.449 --> 49:56.109
He's a genius!

50:01.799 --> 50:03.161
Thank you.

50:03.162 --> 50:06.650
Here you are. Two first-class
tickets to London.

50:13.907 --> 50:16.833
Well, Mr. Holmes, any theories?

50:16.834 --> 50:19.928
Indeed. Obviously Giles and
Ayers were caught in a storm

50:19.929 --> 50:22.090
too far from the shore
to swim for it.

50:22.091 --> 50:25.116
And with that heavy suitcase
attached to his wrist,

50:25.117 --> 50:26.747
and the lake being so deep...

50:26.748 --> 50:29.738
Quite. Pulled the poor
wretch to the bottom.

50:30.008 --> 50:32.070
Struggling futilely,

50:32.071 --> 50:34.332
flailing desperately

50:34.333 --> 50:39.887
as the cold, black water
sealed his fate forever.

50:40.587 --> 50:42.748
Well, it's certainly been a laugh.

50:42.749 --> 50:44.345
Thank you very much.

50:44.346 --> 50:47.438
We must be off. Pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

50:47.439 --> 50:49.466
The same, Doctor.

50:58.351 --> 51:00.578
Now... now...

51:00.579 --> 51:04.037
We know for a fact that
Giles was on the boat.

51:04.038 --> 51:06.399
No, we don't.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.496
Oh.

51:08.497 --> 51:11.855
Well, we do know for a fact that
Giles arrived at Windermere.

51:11.856 --> 51:13.784
No, he didn't.

51:13.785 --> 51:18.204
He didn't? I thought he did.

51:20.737 --> 51:23.166
Well, we really know that Giles

51:23.167 --> 51:26.691
was behind the theft of
the printing plates.

51:27.192 --> 51:29.854
No, he wasn't.

51:31.117 --> 51:33.404
Fine.

51:33.579 --> 51:36.569
Just trying to get things straight.

51:38.003 --> 51:39.299
Tell me something...

51:39.300 --> 51:42.094
is there anything we
do know for a fact?

51:42.095 --> 51:43.759
Yes.

51:44.023 --> 51:45.652
What?

51:45.653 --> 51:48.215
That without a doubt

51:48.216 --> 51:52.838
there is an evil mastermind
behind all of this.

51:54.702 --> 51:58.060
Professor Moriarty?!

51:58.061 --> 52:00.390
Oh, for God's sake.

52:00.391 --> 52:03.850
You didn't tell me that homicidal
maniac was involved in this!

52:03.851 --> 52:06.510
Because I knew you'd
behave this way.

52:06.511 --> 52:09.739
Bravo! Another triumph
for deductive reasoning!

52:09.740 --> 52:12.099
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

52:12.100 --> 52:13.329
Pardon me.

52:13.330 --> 52:16.191
Wasn't I the one he tried
to kill last night?

52:16.192 --> 52:17.986
Merely a technicality.

52:17.987 --> 52:20.614
- Maybe for you, mate.
- Think, man...

52:20.615 --> 52:24.298
Who was supposed to
sleep in that room?

52:25.273 --> 52:27.268
That's true... you were!

52:27.269 --> 52:31.526
Moriarty knows I'm the only
match for his evil genius.

52:31.527 --> 52:33.988
Are you sure he's not
trying to kill me?

52:33.989 --> 52:37.649
Of course not.
He knows you're an idiot.

52:39.909 --> 52:42.038
Thank God.

52:56.342 --> 52:59.298
Whoa, there. Steady.

52:59.502 --> 53:01.687
Stand. Here you are, miss.

53:08.950 --> 53:10.414
Thank you.

53:10.415 --> 53:13.438
It's all very nice, miss.

53:14.506 --> 53:16.169
Miss Leslie Giles?

53:17.533 --> 53:18.664
Yes?

53:18.665 --> 53:21.191
Dr. John Watson, at your service.

53:21.192 --> 53:24.080
And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

53:29.741 --> 53:31.371
But what do you want with me?

53:31.372 --> 53:34.165
The government suspects
that your father has stolen

53:34.166 --> 53:36.594
the printing plates for
the five pound note.

53:36.595 --> 53:38.025
What?

53:38.026 --> 53:41.084
They also believe he is at the
bottom of Lake Windermere,

53:41.085 --> 53:44.008
drowned like a rat.

53:50.467 --> 53:51.663
Father...

53:51.664 --> 53:55.755
- Get some water, please.
- Of course.

53:57.917 --> 53:59.603
Father...

54:04.004 --> 54:06.365
Sorry for the fright, Miss Giles.

54:06.366 --> 54:09.426
Unfortunately, you fainted
before Holmes could add

54:09.427 --> 54:12.819
that he personally believes your
father not only innocent, but alive.

54:12.820 --> 54:14.416
Really?

54:14.417 --> 54:17.776
Holmes believes your
father has been abducted.

54:17.777 --> 54:21.236
Abducted! By whom?

54:21.237 --> 54:23.728
Abductors.

54:24.729 --> 54:27.557
You see, Miss Giles,

54:27.558 --> 54:30.616
your father was described to
us as fanatically neat...

54:30.617 --> 54:34.443
a fact confirmed by the
immaculateness of this very place.

54:34.444 --> 54:37.104
I took the opportunity
to have a look around,

54:37.105 --> 54:40.062
and it is extremely tidy.

54:41.761 --> 54:44.190
One must ask, therefore,

54:44.191 --> 54:48.781
why such a compulsively neat
man would leave an unmade bed,

54:48.782 --> 54:52.173
unless he was snatched
from that very bed.

54:52.174 --> 54:53.370
Oh, dear God.

54:53.371 --> 54:57.163
Then a man posing as your
father was sent to Windermere

54:57.164 --> 54:59.291
where a mock drowning was staged,

54:59.292 --> 55:02.318
unfortunately costing the life of
an innocent boatman named Ayers,

55:02.319 --> 55:03.881
forcibly drowned.

55:03.882 --> 55:06.702
- Murdered.
- Why?

55:08.906 --> 55:11.862
Why, you ask.

55:12.898 --> 55:15.026
Because...

55:15.027 --> 55:16.823
Fill in the details.

55:16.824 --> 55:20.449
Because someone
wanted us to believe

55:20.450 --> 55:23.675
that your father and
the printing plates

55:23.676 --> 55:25.671
were lost at the
bottom of the lake.

55:25.672 --> 55:29.431
Thus Scotland Yard and that
poor, misguided fool Lestrade

55:29.432 --> 55:32.258
would foolishly believe
that the case was closed,

55:32.259 --> 55:34.354
leaving the true villain free

55:34.355 --> 55:38.309
to wreak havoc with the
economy of the Empire.

55:40.475 --> 55:44.101
All quite... elementary.

55:50.355 --> 55:52.915
Let me go!

55:59.336 --> 56:01.464
Have courage!

56:02.530 --> 56:05.486
You're not getting away that easy!

56:05.790 --> 56:08.084
Put me down!

56:08.085 --> 56:10.313
You don't know who
you're dealing with!

56:10.314 --> 56:12.873
My name is Sherlock Holmes!

56:27.645 --> 56:29.774
Look out!

56:34.233 --> 56:36.951
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.

56:37.759 --> 56:40.421
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.

56:41.051 --> 56:44.211
- Hurry!
- My bleeding shoe!

56:45.343 --> 56:48.004
- They're gone.
- I know. I chased them away.

56:48.005 --> 56:50.466
You brave, brave man.

56:50.467 --> 56:54.625
Danger is my trade...
but not yours.

56:54.626 --> 56:57.318
It's unsafe for you to
sleep alone tonight...

56:57.319 --> 56:58.883
unattended.

56:58.884 --> 57:01.244
Yes, we insist you stay with us.

57:01.245 --> 57:04.802
- But surely I'd be an imposition.
- Think nothing of it, my dear.

57:04.803 --> 57:08.195
Indeed, Holmes will be
working all night anyway,

57:08.196 --> 57:10.824
so you can have his room.

57:16.247 --> 57:19.372
Interesting... of
Italian manufacture.

57:19.373 --> 57:20.936
What?

57:20.937 --> 57:23.565
This shoe... brand-new.

57:23.566 --> 57:26.453
Yes, very interesting.

57:27.092 --> 57:30.484
Do you think... do you think
she's ready for bed yet?

57:30.485 --> 57:32.046
And if I'm not mistaken,

57:32.047 --> 57:35.406
caked with mud mainly found in
the vicinity of the Thames.

57:35.407 --> 57:38.600
The Thames, yes. Poor girl.

57:38.601 --> 57:41.818
Poor, beautiful girl.

57:42.194 --> 57:44.423
Some sleep would do her good.

57:44.424 --> 57:50.012
I can picture her lying there, her
eyes closed, gently breathing.

57:52.074 --> 57:54.759
Her breasts heaving...

57:55.068 --> 57:59.852
as her supple, nubile young body...

58:00.523 --> 58:03.549
caresses the cool, limpid sheets...

58:03.550 --> 58:06.733
Yes, the Thames it is.

58:06.943 --> 58:09.903
Near Southwark...
interesting, isn't it?

58:09.904 --> 58:11.766
To say the least.

58:11.767 --> 58:16.024
Why would common ruffians
be wearing imported shoes?

58:16.025 --> 58:19.151
Not secondhand, mind
you, but brand-new.

58:24.109 --> 58:27.167
- What was that?
- What?

58:27.235 --> 58:30.260
If it's not one thing...

58:30.828 --> 58:33.156
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:33.157 --> 58:35.916
I suppose I must be
still rather nervous.

58:35.917 --> 58:39.311
You may rest easy. No one
will disturb you tonight.

58:39.312 --> 58:42.767
- Isn't that so?
- Quite.

58:43.702 --> 58:46.659
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:27.545 --> 59:30.339
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were still asleep.

59:30.340 --> 59:34.623
Sleep? Who can sleep when
there's work to be done?

59:35.629 --> 59:38.490
- Dr. Watson seems to have gone out.
- Really?

59:38.491 --> 59:40.982
I wonder where.

59:41.851 --> 59:43.678
Who knows?

59:43.679 --> 59:48.099
He has very little patience
with detective work.

59:48.438 --> 59:51.099
Often becomes quite bored.

59:53.127 --> 59:55.921
Your job must be very difficult.

59:55.922 --> 59:59.114
One does get rather... tense.

59:59.115 --> 01:00:01.436
I can imagine.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.004
The hardest thing...

01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:08.686
is to find ways to
relieve that tension.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:15.338
So, you play the violin.

01:00:17.212 --> 01:00:20.372
Only if worst comes to worst.

01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:23.764
Well, I really don't want
to add to that tension,

01:00:23.765 --> 01:00:26.623
so I think I'd better go and
finish getting dressed.

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:29.445
No, please, I assure you...

01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:34.476
An occasional break
is quite refreshing.

01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:37.636
My mind thrives on diversity.

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.065
What? What?

01:00:40.066 --> 01:00:42.427
How many times have I
got to tell you to knock?

01:00:42.428 --> 01:00:45.146
Have you no respect
for people's privacy?

01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:49.246
Right! You've gone
quite far enough,

01:00:49.247 --> 01:00:52.106
overstepping the
bounds of propriety.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:55.035
Come along, my dear. You'll
be much safer with me.

01:00:55.036 --> 01:00:58.094
- We'll have tea downstairs.
- Now, there's a good idea.

01:00:58.095 --> 01:00:59.890
You have visitors.

01:00:59.891 --> 01:01:03.183
Such carryings-on, and in
the middle of the day.

01:01:03.184 --> 01:01:07.209
This is a respectable
Presbyterian house, I assure you!

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.470
Take no notice.
The woman drinks a bit.

01:01:09.471 --> 01:01:11.361
Come in, welcome.

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:12.963
Good morning.

01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:15.857
I've informed Lord Smithwick
of the findings in Windermere.

01:01:15.858 --> 01:01:18.186
Though the case did not
turn out as we hoped,

01:01:18.187 --> 01:01:22.178
Her Majesty did insist on
rewarding you for your efforts.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:26.531
Who am I to go against
the wishes of the Queen?

01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:31.293
Stunning, isn't it?

01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:33.689
I'm overwhelmed.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.516
Pity you had to go all
the way to Windermere

01:01:36.517 --> 01:01:38.477
merely to confirm my theories.

01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:42.004
Think nothing of it. If I
hadn't gone to Windermere,

01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.798
I could not have
confirmed my theories...

01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:48.890
namely, that your theories
are completely wrong.

01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:51.187
- What's that?
- This is utter nonsense.

01:01:51.188 --> 01:01:54.711
He refuses to accept that I
solved this case before he did.

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:59.537
Giles is dead, the plates
lost, case closed.

01:01:59.538 --> 01:02:04.059
Neither Giles nor the plates were
ever in Windermere... case open.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.382
- Really?
- What?

01:02:09.383 --> 01:02:14.063
Well, gentlemen, I see Holmes has
taken you into his confidence.

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.367
Did he also tell you

01:02:16.368 --> 01:02:20.051
that we expect to conclude
this case within three days?

01:02:20.494 --> 01:02:25.118
I'll let you fill in
the details, Holmes.

01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:30.240
Let me assure you, Lord Smithwick,

01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:34.430
that come... Friday, you
shall have your plates.

01:02:34.431 --> 01:02:37.292
You must succeed

01:02:37.293 --> 01:02:40.852
before news of the theft leaks out

01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:45.110
and causes widespread panic
throughout the Empire!

01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:46.774
Steady, sir.

01:02:48.538 --> 01:02:51.829
That is exactly why the
Empire now more than ever

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.523
needs all of us to remain
calm and composed.

01:02:55.524 --> 01:02:59.646
You're right, of course.
We must remain composed.

01:02:59.647 --> 01:03:02.706
- Composed.
- And calm.

01:03:05.702 --> 01:03:07.697
Friday? Are you out of your mind?

01:03:07.698 --> 01:03:11.888
Steady on. You've made some
excellent discoveries this morning.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:14.811
Get your coat on.
We have a cab waiting.

01:03:17.045 --> 01:03:19.073
- What discoveries?
- For one thing,

01:03:19.074 --> 01:03:22.599
the Royal Mint purchased its paper
from the Camden paper mill.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.990
You make these things
up, don't you?

01:03:29.121 --> 01:03:31.914
Those men were here about
my father, weren't they?

01:03:31.915 --> 01:03:34.574
Oh, good morning.

01:03:34.575 --> 01:03:37.235
Is there any news, anything at all?

01:03:37.236 --> 01:03:39.297
Sadly, no.

01:03:41.263 --> 01:03:44.455
But take heart. Last night
something occurred to Holmes,

01:03:44.456 --> 01:03:47.083
and he suddenly realized
how stupid he'd been.

01:03:47.084 --> 01:03:48.514
Really?

01:03:48.515 --> 01:03:51.441
- I didn't exactly say "stupid."
- Yes, you did.

01:03:51.442 --> 01:03:54.102
And now he's off to
continue the investigation.

01:03:54.103 --> 01:03:57.262
- Perhaps I could come, too.
- Ah. Now...

01:03:57.263 --> 01:04:00.589
The moment he knows
anything, he'll tell you.

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:03.548
- Thank you.
- Cabbie.

01:04:17.289 --> 01:04:18.685
What's that?

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:22.436
A reply to a telegram
I sent late last night.

01:04:24.441 --> 01:04:26.668
You might let me in
on the joke, old boy.

01:04:26.669 --> 01:04:28.798
In due time.

01:04:33.122 --> 01:04:36.046
Cabbie, stop.

01:04:36.183 --> 01:04:38.178
You was dead right, Doctor!

01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:40.941
All of 'em, just sittin'
there waitin' for customs.

01:04:40.942 --> 01:04:43.700
Wonderful! Just as I thought!

01:04:43.701 --> 01:04:45.523
Hop in, lad!

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:50.281
Driver, Southwark docks!

01:05:07.554 --> 01:05:08.717
Thanks, guv'nor.

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:10.937
Wiggins.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.605
Here they are.

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:33.599
- We found 'em here this morning.
- Wonderful.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.918
All these crates full
of imported shoes.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.918
And the ship?

01:05:40.919 --> 01:05:43.813
Got in this morning from Germany.
Two days late, she was.

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:47.563
Excellent. You've
done well, my boy.

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:50.328
We'll take it from here.

01:05:59.314 --> 01:06:01.110
Picture it...

01:06:01.111 --> 01:06:05.301
two, three, maybe four
of Moriarty's henchmen

01:06:05.302 --> 01:06:08.994
waiting here under cover
of darkness for that ship.

01:06:08.995 --> 01:06:10.358
But it's delayed.

01:06:10.359 --> 01:06:13.352
They wait. They become bored.

01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:16.579
Being men of no moral
fiber whatsoever,

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.899
they can't resist helping
themselves to a new pair of shoes.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.060
Do you think they
have these in brown?

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.816
I hate Italian shoes.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:03.949
Moriarty.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.770
- Moriarty?
- Without doubt.

01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:14.019
- This one.
- All right.

01:07:32.124 --> 01:07:34.321
What's "tinte"?

01:07:34.322 --> 01:07:36.682
German for "ink."

01:07:36.683 --> 01:07:40.408
He smuggled it in to avoid the
attention of Scotland Yard.

01:07:40.409 --> 01:07:41.838
Marvelous.

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:44.099
He already has the paper he needs.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.229
He got it from The
Camden Paper Mill...

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.957
burning the place to the
ground to cover the theft.

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:53.414
The John Clay case was staged
simply to throw me off the scent.

01:07:53.415 --> 01:07:56.632
What's the German for "pen"?

01:08:00.734 --> 01:08:03.123
What's all this?

01:08:03.229 --> 01:08:04.914
Blast!

01:08:06.988 --> 01:08:09.048
You can't be movin' things about.

01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:12.232
It has to be cleared
through customs.

01:08:13.142 --> 01:08:16.901
Sorry, Professor. We thought
the dock was deserted.

01:08:16.902 --> 01:08:19.960
Sorry, indeed.

01:08:21.526 --> 01:08:25.241
I went to all this trouble...

01:08:26.115 --> 01:08:28.743
for the sake of discretion.

01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:32.362
Then you allow this to happen.

01:08:34.596 --> 01:08:36.658
Well?

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:55.085
Do you have your revolver with you?

01:08:55.122 --> 01:08:57.183
Yeah, somewhere.

01:09:03.938 --> 01:09:05.301
Come on.

01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:08.229
Let's not be all day about it.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:09.792
Here it is.

01:09:09.794 --> 01:09:13.680
Now, I'm gonna let you
have some bullets for it.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.013
Try not to shoot yourself...

01:09:16.014 --> 01:09:19.402
at least, not until
I give the signal.

01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:35.337
Moriarty.

01:09:38.169 --> 01:09:39.854
Damn.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:49.377
What am I doing here?

01:09:49.379 --> 01:09:52.732
Nobody told me Moriarty was...

01:10:10.004 --> 01:10:12.189
- Holmes!
- What?

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.594
Come on!

01:10:29.197 --> 01:10:31.519
Die, Moriarty.

01:10:35.519 --> 01:10:37.374
Idiot!

01:10:41.006 --> 01:10:42.070
Come on!

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:45.197
They can't follow
us down the canal.

01:10:47.095 --> 01:10:50.913
How demeaning to be
set upon by nitwits.

01:11:15.303 --> 01:11:17.694
What are you doing?

01:11:20.062 --> 01:11:21.849
Damn!

01:11:27.379 --> 01:11:29.406
Look out!

01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:13.351
No luck, Sergeant.

01:12:19.241 --> 01:12:21.959
- Anything?
- No, sir.

01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:26.493
The tide may have carried
the body miles downriver.

01:13:04.282 --> 01:13:07.069
Is it true?

01:13:08.274 --> 01:13:11.161
I'm afraid it's true.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:18.219
I am so sorry.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.181
He was such a good man.

01:13:21.182 --> 01:13:24.107
I can't believe he's gone.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.602
I know it's difficult
at such a time,

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:31.228
but if it's any consolation,
we still have Mr. Holmes.

01:13:34.386 --> 01:13:37.172
Did I say something wrong?

01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:56.475
I seem to have overestimated
the amount of rope required.

01:13:56.476 --> 01:13:58.704
One more thing I've botched.

01:13:58.705 --> 01:14:02.196
What would Dr. Watson say?

01:14:02.197 --> 01:14:04.991
He'd have volunteered to kick
the chair out from under me!

01:14:04.992 --> 01:14:06.488
He would not!

01:14:06.489 --> 01:14:09.875
He said this was gonna be
our last case together.

01:14:13.808 --> 01:14:16.035
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:17.732
You can still avenge
the doctor's death

01:14:17.733 --> 01:14:21.556
by capturing this Moriarty
and rescuing my father.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.254
Oh, what a good idea.

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:26.546
While I'm at it, I'll bring
in the Loch Ness Monster.

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:29.675
I don't understand!

01:14:29.676 --> 01:14:32.935
I am not a detective.
I never solved anything.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:34.630
Dr. Watson did.

01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:36.159
You're just upset.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.954
I couldn't detect horse
manure if I stepped in it.

01:14:38.955 --> 01:14:41.412
Please, Mr. Holmes!

01:14:41.717 --> 01:14:43.777
Sorry.

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:02.771
- Another one?
- Yes, please.

01:15:03.972 --> 01:15:05.567
Stop.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.095
Perhaps not.

01:15:08.096 --> 01:15:13.684
I'm afraid my grief... has
exceeded my resources.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:20.902
- It's on the house.
- Thank you, Henry.

01:15:27.292 --> 01:15:29.485
Thank goodness!

01:15:29.486 --> 01:15:33.373
Mrs. Hudson said we
might find you here.

01:15:34.576 --> 01:15:38.333
We want to offer you
our condolences.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:41.688
Pity about Dr. Watson.

01:15:42.526 --> 01:15:44.387
I trust, however,

01:15:44.388 --> 01:15:48.308
it will have no bearing on
the outcome of the case.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.609
What?

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:55.657
You vowed to solve
the case by Friday.

01:15:57.429 --> 01:15:59.290
Well, you see,

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:03.016
the fact of the matter is,
you see, Lord Smithwick,

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.076
is... Dr. Watson...

01:16:06.077 --> 01:16:09.537
I believe what Mr. Holmes
is trying to say

01:16:09.538 --> 01:16:14.390
is that it was Dr. Watson who
first made that pledge, and...

01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:16.457
with all due respect,

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:20.282
I'm sure he did not fully understand
the complexities of the case.

01:16:20.283 --> 01:16:22.610
As I have tried to point
out to Your Lordship,

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.773
Her Majesty should
rely on the counsel

01:16:24.774 --> 01:16:27.467
of trained criminologists
such as myself.

01:16:27.468 --> 01:16:31.558
Though well-meaning,
the good doctor was...

01:16:31.892 --> 01:16:33.783
no detective.

01:16:35.452 --> 01:16:38.046
As I was about to
say, Lord Smithwick,

01:16:38.047 --> 01:16:40.374
Dr. Watson was decidedly precise

01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:43.767
in his estimate of the
closure of this case.

01:16:43.768 --> 01:16:45.928
Have no fear...

01:16:45.929 --> 01:16:51.315
you shall have the plates
in your hands come Friday.

01:16:59.635 --> 01:17:01.398
What?

01:17:01.399 --> 01:17:04.422
The game's afoot!

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.650
Dr. Watson always said,

01:17:08.651 --> 01:17:11.777
start by listing
everything you know.

01:17:11.778 --> 01:17:13.540
So, let us begin.

01:17:13.541 --> 01:17:16.995
Number one.

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:18.963
Moriarty.

01:17:18.964 --> 01:17:22.180
Isn't he wonderful?

01:17:23.787 --> 01:17:27.544
He is behind all this,
that's one thing we know.

01:17:27.545 --> 01:17:31.137
Very good. Progressing nicely.

01:17:31.138 --> 01:17:35.729
Now, the next thing
we know... number two.

01:17:40.186 --> 01:17:44.640
This might take a while.
I'll get some tea.

01:17:46.905 --> 01:17:48.569
What?

01:18:00.478 --> 01:18:02.800
All right...

01:18:03.173 --> 01:18:05.731
let's go back to number one.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.327
Perhaps the clue is
in Moriarty's name.

01:18:09.328 --> 01:18:11.920
Clever people often do that.

01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:14.440
Amity...

01:18:15.182 --> 01:18:17.844
rarity...

01:18:18.642 --> 01:18:20.305
I've got it!

01:18:20.703 --> 01:18:23.491
His real name is Arty Morty!

01:18:25.327 --> 01:18:28.181
What the hell am I talking about?

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:31.015
I found a five pound note
floating in the river.

01:18:31.016 --> 01:18:32.412
Lucky you.

01:18:32.413 --> 01:18:34.442
But it's only half printed!

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.660
I suppose it's only worth
two pounds-ten, then.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.046
Everyone knows the
normal five pound note

01:18:48.047 --> 01:18:51.772
carries a serial number
which contains five digits.

01:18:51.773 --> 01:18:53.569
- Six digits.
- Six digits.

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.265
This one contains only three.

01:18:55.266 --> 01:18:59.424
- Two-three-four.
- What's that mean?

01:18:59.425 --> 01:19:02.617
Her father's a printer, ain't he?

01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:05.540
Maybe he's trying to
tell us where he is.

01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:10.600
What can these numbers mean?

01:19:10.601 --> 01:19:13.030
Could be a measurement...
an address!

01:19:13.031 --> 01:19:15.358
- An amount!
- A page number!

01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:18.020
Did your father have
a favorite book?

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.084
He did!

01:19:19.085 --> 01:19:21.246
- The Bible.
- Yes.

01:19:21.247 --> 01:19:24.907
I have a Bible. It's at my bedside.

01:19:25.339 --> 01:19:27.700
Is there something on page 234?

01:19:27.701 --> 01:19:30.095
Page numbers vary
from Bible to Bible,

01:19:30.096 --> 01:19:33.123
but chapter and verse is
the same in every Bible.

01:19:33.124 --> 01:19:36.443
Did your father have a
favorite book of the Bible?

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:38.135
Yes, he did.

01:19:39.543 --> 01:19:41.140
The book of Psalms.

01:19:41.141 --> 01:19:44.332
Psalms 23rd, verse four.

01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:48.257
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley of...

01:19:48.258 --> 01:19:50.552
the shadow of death."

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.807
Does that mean something?

01:19:53.215 --> 01:19:57.006
That means... the Orpheum Theater.

01:19:57.007 --> 01:19:59.235
What are you talking about?

01:19:59.236 --> 01:20:02.725
I'm sorry, but I just
don't understand.

01:20:03.728 --> 01:20:05.456
The Shadow of Death.

01:20:05.457 --> 01:20:09.182
The gripping drama was the last
play presented at the Orpheum.

01:20:09.183 --> 01:20:13.140
It closed after only one night, but
not without garnering some praise.

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:17.631
Harris, in the Daily Telegram. Said,
"In an otherwise dismal evening,

01:20:17.632 --> 01:20:20.693
Reginald Kincaid provided
some welcome laughs."

01:20:20.694 --> 01:20:23.852
Laughs? You said it
was a gripping drama.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:26.979
It's unimportant now, isn't it?

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.639
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.034
- Cab!
- Oh, dear.

01:20:33.035 --> 01:20:35.495
The Fleet River runs
under that part of town.

01:20:35.496 --> 01:20:38.024
The Orpheum Theater stands
right on top of it.

01:20:38.025 --> 01:20:39.654
You could be on to something.

01:20:39.655 --> 01:20:42.747
There's tunnels and caverns
running all under there.

01:20:43.314 --> 01:20:46.904
- Just a moment!
- We haven't got a moment!

01:20:46.905 --> 01:20:49.466
Wiggins, fetch Scotland Yard.

01:20:49.467 --> 01:20:51.230
Let me, Mr. Holmes.

01:20:51.231 --> 01:20:54.190
I'm sure they'll be much more
inclined to listen to me.

01:20:54.191 --> 01:20:55.753
Good idea. Wiggins, on the back.

01:20:55.754 --> 01:20:59.879
The Orpheum Theater.
We haven't a moment to lose!

01:21:12.353 --> 01:21:16.672
I kind of liked you better
when you was a coward.

01:21:19.439 --> 01:21:21.535
The stage door's round
back. Go ahead.

01:21:21.536 --> 01:21:24.719
- You go ahead.
- Wiggins, go ahead.

01:21:36.638 --> 01:21:39.731
Here ya go, gents.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:47.580
Here you go, my good man.
You may keep the change.

01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:50.476
A fiver? God bless ya, guv'nor!

01:21:50.477 --> 01:21:52.538
Think nothing of it.
I print my own.

01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:55.994
"Print me own"...
that's a good one.

01:21:56.531 --> 01:22:00.155
Still, we can't
afford to waste them.

01:22:39.843 --> 01:22:43.135
We shall move the barge
out at high tide.

01:22:43.136 --> 01:22:47.817
I shall miss this
place... somewhat.

01:22:48.657 --> 01:22:49.754
Go around front.

01:22:49.755 --> 01:22:52.482
When the police get here,
tell them what happened.

01:22:52.483 --> 01:22:53.912
Right you are.

01:22:53.913 --> 01:22:55.808
And...

01:22:55.809 --> 01:22:59.101
the best of British luck to you
both. You're gonna need it.

01:22:59.102 --> 01:23:01.696
And don't move until they get here!

01:23:04.159 --> 01:23:06.287
Up we go.

01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:22.285
- Hold on to that.
- Slowly.

01:23:29.807 --> 01:23:32.026
Where are we?

01:23:33.699 --> 01:23:36.426
Don't kick the...

01:23:36.427 --> 01:23:38.850
- bucket.

01:24:41.595 --> 01:24:43.281
Let go.

01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:49.212
Are you quite serious?

01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:12.758
Do you do this kind
of thing on purpose?

01:25:13.196 --> 01:25:14.882
Listen.

01:25:18.386 --> 01:25:21.013
It's nothing, Professor.
Probably rats.

01:25:21.014 --> 01:25:24.696
Ah, yes... rats.

01:25:30.129 --> 01:25:31.918
I think...

01:25:32.292 --> 01:25:36.145
I think it's louder over here.

01:25:37.248 --> 01:25:39.205
It might...

01:25:48.125 --> 01:25:50.953
I am so dreadfully sorry.

01:25:50.954 --> 01:25:52.782
On the contrary,

01:25:52.783 --> 01:25:55.841
I think we're making
very good progress.

01:26:30.039 --> 01:26:33.326
There's a hole in the wall.

01:26:44.178 --> 01:26:46.863
I'm not stayin' around here.

01:26:56.752 --> 01:26:59.346
Blimey.

01:27:00.777 --> 01:27:03.302
Well, well.

01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:09.425
The ink's not dry yet.

01:27:09.426 --> 01:27:13.018
There's more paper line over here.

01:27:13.784 --> 01:27:16.207
Hand over.

01:27:24.295 --> 01:27:26.981
You've done a splendid
job, Mr. Giles.

01:27:31.516 --> 01:27:34.409
The Queen herself could
hardly tell the difference.

01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:36.570
However...

01:27:36.571 --> 01:27:40.695
this one seems to have
been only half printed.

01:27:40.863 --> 01:27:43.751
It was found on the
bank of the river.

01:27:44.024 --> 01:27:47.182
I've got a pussycat

01:27:47.183 --> 01:27:49.876
And I'm very fond of that

01:27:49.877 --> 01:27:51.740
A reject.

01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:54.130
Must have slipped away.

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:56.197
And the tide carried it out.

01:27:56.198 --> 01:27:57.626
The tide, that's all.

01:27:57.627 --> 01:28:00.620
Suppose we have a
look at this reject.

01:28:00.621 --> 01:28:01.851
Shall we?

01:28:01.852 --> 01:28:04.276
Two-three-four...

01:28:06.677 --> 01:28:10.063
Oh, yes. Clever.

01:28:10.901 --> 01:28:14.193
How many of these rejects
accidentally slipped away?

01:28:14.194 --> 01:28:15.957
Well, I...

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.720
No matter.

01:28:17.721 --> 01:28:20.747
Shame that the only person
capable of deducing your clue

01:28:20.748 --> 01:28:24.168
is currently lying at the
bottom of the Thames.

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.159
What are you doing here?

01:28:29.398 --> 01:28:31.991
I told you to keep an
eye on that imbecile!

01:28:31.992 --> 01:28:35.416
- He may yet stumble onto something.
- He has.

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:37.845
They know all about this place.

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:40.939
Luckily for you, they sent
me to fetch Scotland Yard.

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:44.864
- All right, no Scotland Yard. Fine.
- What now, Professor?

01:28:44.865 --> 01:28:47.527
No need to panic.

01:28:48.425 --> 01:28:50.321
I need a good plan.

01:28:50.322 --> 01:28:51.917
Attack!

01:28:51.918 --> 01:28:54.478
Attack with what?

01:29:01.897 --> 01:29:04.558
That's no good.

01:29:06.654 --> 01:29:09.009
Start packing!

01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:12.707
In spite of this latest
piece of foolishness,

01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:14.903
you've done your job well.

01:29:14.904 --> 01:29:19.822
Your reward will be a quick and
relatively painless departure.

01:29:19.894 --> 01:29:22.781
Not so fast, Moriarty.

01:29:27.944 --> 01:29:32.465
I've been waiting hours
for your arrival.

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:37.491
- Thank God you're here!
- Please, my dear.

01:29:37.492 --> 01:29:41.083
Ingenious, planting
a spy in our midst.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:44.577
That staged attack at
Giles' was quite realistic.

01:29:44.578 --> 01:29:47.936
However, a cable to France
revealed a rather unique fact

01:29:47.937 --> 01:29:51.393
about the real Miss Giles...

01:29:52.395 --> 01:29:56.848
something of an embarrassment
to the Giles family, I should think.

01:30:12.586 --> 01:30:17.209
Perhaps you would like to
meet the real Lesley Giles.

01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:19.237
Lesley!

01:30:20.072 --> 01:30:23.264
All right, back to
the first plan...

01:30:23.265 --> 01:30:24.994
attack.

01:30:24.995 --> 01:30:28.088
Pity you won't be able to
share my greatest triumph...

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.912
the forcing of an
empire to its knees.

01:30:31.913 --> 01:30:36.004
But you will be allowed
to see these two die...

01:30:36.005 --> 01:30:38.395
before you.

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:48.669
Right!

01:30:49.712 --> 01:30:51.108
Don't anybody move.

01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:54.435
Otherwise, there'll be
an impromptu roasting.

01:30:54.436 --> 01:30:57.096
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Holmes,

01:30:57.097 --> 01:30:59.657
that if you set fire to that money,

01:30:59.658 --> 01:31:00.919
you will burn to death yourself?

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.809
You will burn to death yourself?

01:31:05.545 --> 01:31:07.503
Of course it has.

01:31:09.204 --> 01:31:11.661
Put out those flames!

01:31:13.495 --> 01:31:15.986
Don't just stand there!

01:31:20.181 --> 01:31:22.242
Look out!

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:37.714
- I thought you were dead.
- You may yet be right.

01:31:41.771 --> 01:31:44.728
I'm not done with you yet!

01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:05.952
- Put sand on it!
- Bring more buckets!

01:32:06.321 --> 01:32:09.880
- Get some water in here!
- Clear those boxes!

01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:12.338
Leave this to me.

01:32:17.697 --> 01:32:19.656
There, there, my dear.

01:32:20.027 --> 01:32:22.212
We're in a tinderbox!

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.609
What was that?

01:32:31.303 --> 01:32:33.032
You cowards!

01:32:33.033 --> 01:32:35.628
- Professor, the gas mains!
- What?

01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:37.723
They could blow in the heat!

01:32:37.724 --> 01:32:40.647
Keep them pinned down.
I'll get the plates.

01:32:43.246 --> 01:32:46.339
It's all over now, my pretty one.

01:32:51.363 --> 01:32:53.752
You're disappointed, aren't you?

01:33:03.406 --> 01:33:05.398
Hell!

01:33:14.981 --> 01:33:16.044
Brilliant.

01:33:16.045 --> 01:33:19.433
Why didn't you kill him
when you had the chance?

01:33:22.599 --> 01:33:26.258
Rock of ages

01:33:26.259 --> 01:33:28.852
Cleft for me

01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:32.047
Let me hide

01:33:32.048 --> 01:33:35.872
Myself in thee

01:33:35.873 --> 01:33:38.067
Rock of age...

01:33:38.068 --> 01:33:40.894
Go on, hurry up!

01:33:40.895 --> 01:33:44.713
- Get movin'!
- Come on, George!

01:33:48.181 --> 01:33:51.535
- Let's get out of here!
- The back door!

01:34:14.293 --> 01:34:16.183
It's safe, Professor.

01:34:25.306 --> 01:34:26.800
Come on.

01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:29.994
This is an escape, not a cakewalk.

01:34:29.995 --> 01:34:33.281
Oh, please... don't
wait for me, will you?

01:34:38.312 --> 01:34:40.007
Mercy me!

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.369
Oh, my dear...

01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:45.361
that must have been so painful!

01:34:46.096 --> 01:34:47.193
Hello?

01:34:47.194 --> 01:34:49.356
All right...

01:34:49.988 --> 01:34:52.150
There he is!

01:34:52.317 --> 01:34:55.841
- You hold them off.
- Just like I told ya.

01:34:58.605 --> 01:35:00.134
Oh, my head.

01:35:00.135 --> 01:35:02.955
It's all right, dear.
It's still there.

01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:09.116
- Sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
- Watson, there's a fire down here.

01:35:09.117 --> 01:35:11.577
It became necessary for
me to stage my death

01:35:11.578 --> 01:35:14.205
so I might work unobserved
for a few days.

01:35:14.206 --> 01:35:17.887
And I must say, you've
caused quite a bit of grief.

01:35:20.258 --> 01:35:23.251
You needn't bother with her...
she's an imposter.

01:35:23.252 --> 01:35:26.547
She's not Leslie Giles?
Then who is?

01:35:26.548 --> 01:35:28.676
I am.

01:35:30.238 --> 01:35:32.401
There you have it.

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:37.922
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:35:39.088 --> 01:35:41.943
you seem to be blocking my exit.

01:35:46.872 --> 01:35:50.000
Kindly step aside.

01:35:59.813 --> 01:36:04.301
Remove these people from the stage.

01:36:07.497 --> 01:36:09.218
They're locked.

01:36:12.986 --> 01:36:16.544
Ordinarily I do not bother
with half-wits and buffoons.

01:36:16.545 --> 01:36:18.934
Buffoon, is it?

01:36:22.367 --> 01:36:23.996
Buffoons, is it?

01:36:23.997 --> 01:36:26.957
- He'll be killed!
- I quite doubt it.

01:36:26.958 --> 01:36:29.948
He's in his element now.

01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:36.095
I warn you... I've killed as
many as six men in a week.

01:36:37.169 --> 01:36:39.525
Eight, if you count matinees.

01:36:49.678 --> 01:36:53.666
"The brilliant swordsmanship
of Reginald Kincaid...

01:36:56.530 --> 01:36:59.324
...was almost worth the
price of admission,"

01:36:59.325 --> 01:37:01.646
raved the critic of the...

01:37:03.049 --> 01:37:05.346
Cotswold Press.

01:37:05.347 --> 01:37:09.238
All right, put your
shoulders to it, men.

01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:12.524
Let's have it down. The rest
of you, round the back.

01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:39.832
He really is quite good.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.640
- Follow me.
- Follow him, lads!

01:38:05.857 --> 01:38:08.075
Trying to be funny, eh?

01:38:11.113 --> 01:38:13.939
Hold on! Don't anybody move!

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.432
The authorities are here!

01:38:16.433 --> 01:38:18.627
Stay where you are, everyone.

01:38:18.628 --> 01:38:21.086
Get down!

01:38:22.755 --> 01:38:24.451
Right.

01:38:24.452 --> 01:38:26.479
I have killed before,

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.473
and I can assure you I have
absolutely no compunction

01:38:29.474 --> 01:38:30.869
about doing so again.

01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:34.053
You are not dealing with
an amateur, you know.

01:38:34.862 --> 01:38:36.923
Well played.

01:38:43.545 --> 01:38:46.865
Once more unto the
breach, dear friends.

01:38:48.702 --> 01:38:50.431
You're alive!

01:38:50.432 --> 01:38:55.021
Astounding observation,
Inspector... we must discuss it.

01:38:55.854 --> 01:38:57.981
Well done!

01:39:16.844 --> 01:39:18.306
Stand back!

01:39:18.307 --> 01:39:21.701
I'm about to bring the world's
greatest criminal to justice,

01:39:21.702 --> 01:39:23.597
and nothing's going to stop me!

01:39:23.598 --> 01:39:26.621
Have you forgotten the gas mains?

01:39:50.442 --> 01:39:53.835
More pressure! Come on, boys!

01:39:53.836 --> 01:39:56.996
More water! Come on!

01:39:57.861 --> 01:40:00.921
Congratulations!

01:40:00.922 --> 01:40:04.846
Her Majesty wishes to offer
you her sincerest appreciation

01:40:04.847 --> 01:40:06.709
for a job well done.

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:09.203
And you too, Dr. Watson.

01:40:09.204 --> 01:40:14.758
Mr. Giles tells me that you
both deciphered the clue.

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:17.985
I doubted if anyone
would understand it.

01:40:17.986 --> 01:40:19.882
Child's play.

01:40:19.883 --> 01:40:22.144
- 23rd Psalm.
- Shadow of death.

01:40:22.145 --> 01:40:24.068
Elementary.

01:40:24.507 --> 01:40:30.718
No, no, no... I was referring
to the serial number... 234.

01:40:32.756 --> 01:40:37.007
The address of the theater...
234 Beacon Street.

01:40:39.476 --> 01:40:42.262
Amazing!

01:40:44.732 --> 01:40:47.915
Don't worry, I'll fix
it in the story.

01:40:48.225 --> 01:40:50.719
The arrests were made, and the
rest of the story you know.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.641
Don't mean to toot my own
horn, you understand.

01:40:56.275 --> 01:40:59.601
Nice bit of work, this. But
as I was telling Miss Giles,

01:40:59.602 --> 01:41:02.660
had it not been for the timely
arrival of Scotland Yard,

01:41:02.661 --> 01:41:05.549
I doubt things would
have turned out so well.

01:41:05.956 --> 01:41:09.638
Of course, I realize you would
never admit such a thing.

01:41:12.342 --> 01:41:14.004
On the contrary.

01:41:14.005 --> 01:41:17.331
Indeed, Holmes was telling me
how indispensable you were.

01:41:17.332 --> 01:41:19.395
- He was?
- As a matter of fact,

01:41:19.396 --> 01:41:22.253
it is to Lestrade,
and Lestrade alone,

01:41:22.254 --> 01:41:25.513
that you owe your
deepest gratitude.

01:41:25.514 --> 01:41:27.111
Really?

01:41:27.112 --> 01:41:31.635
Miss Giles is on the
stage, you know, in Paris.

01:41:31.636 --> 01:41:35.296
A revue called Les Femmmes Faux.

01:41:37.757 --> 01:41:40.949
An actress... what a surprise.

01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:44.972
There's more surprises yet to come.

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:09.093
Good morning!

01:42:09.094 --> 01:42:12.453
Excuse me, sir. Is it true
that Moriarty is dead?

01:42:12.454 --> 01:42:15.547
Never assume, gentlemen,
never assume.

01:42:17.544 --> 01:42:20.637
How did you know where
Moriarty was hiding out?

01:42:20.638 --> 01:42:25.026
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand.

01:42:25.027 --> 01:42:27.387
But how is it that
Scotland Yard did not...

01:42:27.388 --> 01:42:29.550
Perhaps...

01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:34.739
Perhaps Scotland Yard did not
have the invaluable assistance,

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:37.467
the keen insight

01:42:37.468 --> 01:42:40.289
and the extraordinary patience...

01:42:41.061 --> 01:42:43.518
of Dr. John Watson.

01:42:49.844 --> 01:42:52.301
My friend.

01:43:00.787 --> 01:43:03.110
Hear, hear!

01:43:04.214 --> 01:43:05.878
Now, gentlemen and ladies,

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:09.203
I have an announcement
of some consequence.

01:43:09.204 --> 01:43:12.662
With the safe return of the
plates to the Royal Mint,

01:43:12.663 --> 01:43:15.390
I must inform you

01:43:15.391 --> 01:43:18.053
that this is my last case.

01:43:18.952 --> 01:43:22.045
Sherlock Holmes is retired.

01:43:22.046 --> 01:43:25.837
Surely not, sir. That cannot be!

01:43:25.838 --> 01:43:27.066
Is it possible?

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:30.461
Of course it's not possible.
Mr. Holmes is merely pulling your leg.

01:43:30.462 --> 01:43:31.857
Aren't you?

01:43:31.858 --> 01:43:35.749
Sherlock Holmes retire, when there
is murder and mayhem at every turn?

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:37.977
Already several adventures
have begun to take shape

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:41.570
which can be solved by
no one else. Right?

01:43:44.066 --> 01:43:46.354
Right you are.

01:43:48.923 --> 01:43:51.948
And so, without further ado,

01:43:51.949 --> 01:43:55.132
I hereby declare this case...

01:43:56.342 --> 01:43:58.197
closed.
