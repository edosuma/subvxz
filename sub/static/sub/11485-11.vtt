WEBVTT

00:05.221 --> 00:08.156
Okay, after I get the tickets,
you line up for the popcorn,

00:08.224 --> 00:10.021
while I go nail down some good seats.

00:10.126 --> 00:13.960
I want butter in the middle.
Don't just let them squirt it on the top.

00:14.831 --> 00:16.297
And a large cherry slurpy.

00:16.366 --> 00:18.960
Then you hold the seats
while I go to the men's room,

00:19.035 --> 00:20.627
and then I'll do the same for you.

00:20.704 --> 00:23.798
That way we can enjoy our drinks
during the movie without fear.

00:23.873 --> 00:24.999
Got you.

00:27.544 --> 00:30.377
- You're not gonna do any of that, are you?
- Nope.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.744
So you want to go in there
with no coordination,

00:32.849 --> 00:36.649
- no strategy, just winging it?
- That's what I'm thinking.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.188
I have no faith in this at all.

00:48.565 --> 00:51.557
Now for her,
I'd stand in line for a butter squirt.

00:53.236 --> 00:54.897
Yeah, she is a hottie.

00:57.841 --> 01:01.675
Hey, that's no hottie. That's your ex-wife.

01:04.414 --> 01:06.678
- Judith?
- Alan.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.718
Sorry about the squirt thing.

01:10.253 --> 01:13.120
Wow, look at you. New hair, clothes.

01:13.389 --> 01:15.687
You look... Wow.

01:16.126 --> 01:18.560
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:20.263 --> 01:21.753
It's a public service

01:21.865 --> 01:24.629
when a gay chick goes lipstick
instead of lumberjack.

01:26.603 --> 01:29.572
So, how was the movie? Where's Jake?

01:29.939 --> 01:33.397
Home with the babysitter.
Alan, I'm kind of on a date.

01:34.811 --> 01:37.211
Okay, is that her?

01:37.580 --> 01:41.072
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm the ex.

01:42.719 --> 01:44.448
Alan, that's not my date.

01:45.955 --> 01:49.618
- Hey, Alan.
- Phil? What a coincidence.

01:49.726 --> 01:53.093
Phil is Jake's soccer coach.
Phil, you remember Judith.

01:53.163 --> 01:54.960
Well, yeah...

01:55.131 --> 01:56.996
One-Mississippi...

01:57.600 --> 01:59.329
- Alan?
- What?

01:59.435 --> 02:00.993
...two-Mississippi.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.165
Oh, God.

02:06.109 --> 02:07.804
Okay, we're all caught up.

02:08.478 --> 02:11.936
Wait, you're dating Phil?
How can you be dating Phil?

02:12.015 --> 02:13.642
Alan, he asked me out.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.151
What about the whole gay thing?
Did you even give that a chance?

02:17.287 --> 02:18.481
Phil, we'd better go.

02:18.588 --> 02:21.421
Hey, look, Alan,
I hope this doesn't affect our friendship.

02:21.491 --> 02:25.427
- No. Call me, we'll hang out.
- Great. Hey, how's Tuesday?

02:25.495 --> 02:28.157
Tuesday's good.
Judith, how's Tuesday for you?

02:28.264 --> 02:29.822
Just walk away.

02:30.433 --> 02:33.960
I know you built your sundeck
without a permit and I am calling it in.

02:34.704 --> 02:35.864
Alan, chill.

02:35.972 --> 02:39.373
That two-faced, wife-poaching,
soccer-coaching, rat-bastard!

02:40.977 --> 02:42.444
Come on, let it go.

02:42.612 --> 02:45.809
- I'll treat you to a cherry slurpy.
- I don't want a cherry slurpy.

02:45.882 --> 02:49.443
Are you sure?
'Cause I think Phil's gonna get one.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.329 --> 03:00.728
What does she think she's doing?

03:00.830 --> 03:03.162
She's straight, she's gay,
she's straight again.

03:03.233 --> 03:06.066
Place your bets.
Where she lands, nobody knows.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.830
Alan, it's no big deal.

03:07.904 --> 03:10.668
Women get to experiment
with their sexuality.

03:10.740 --> 03:14.039
It's only guys who have to make a choice
and stick to it.

03:14.410 --> 03:17.072
- Where do you get this stuff?
- I make it up.

03:18.882 --> 03:21.077
Anyway, it doesn't matter what Judith is.

03:21.184 --> 03:23.812
- It only matters what she's not.
- And what is she not?

03:23.887 --> 03:26.082
She is not coming back to you, pal.

03:27.390 --> 03:28.857
Thank you for your sensitivity.

03:28.925 --> 03:32.019
All I'm saying is,
is that Judith has moved on with her life,

03:32.095 --> 03:34.029
and maybe it's time for you
to do the same.

03:34.097 --> 03:36.031
I know. It's just... I can't.

03:36.099 --> 03:38.329
- Sure you can. I'll help you.
- How?

03:38.401 --> 03:42.201
I don't know, by saying things like,
"Sure you can. I'll help you. "

03:42.272 --> 03:43.671
Great, thanks.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.708
Look, this isn't just about you, you know?

03:45.775 --> 03:49.211
All this wallowing in the past
is causing other people to suffer.

03:49.279 --> 03:51.406
- You mean Jake.
- I mean me.

03:52.548 --> 03:54.948
You are really starting to piss me off.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.549
Okay, that's enough help for now.

03:57.921 --> 04:00.913
I'm saying maybe it's time
to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

04:01.024 --> 04:04.255
- You're right, I know you're right.
- Forget Judith.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.955
There's a whole world out there
that you haven't pissed off yet.

04:08.798 --> 04:11.232
There is no reason I couldn't
find happiness with someone else.

04:11.301 --> 04:12.393
There you go.

04:12.468 --> 04:14.800
This could be the beginning
of the rest of my life.

04:14.904 --> 04:17.031
A bit of a bumper sticker,
but sure, why not?

04:17.106 --> 04:21.303
In fact, for the first time since college,
I can go after any woman I want.

04:21.411 --> 04:23.709
Heck, I could take a page from your book

04:23.780 --> 04:28.444
- and date them two, three at a time.
- Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, right.

04:30.086 --> 04:32.919
You know what?
I'm gonna start right now.

04:49.939 --> 04:51.497
I am gonna die alone.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.637
No.

04:54.744 --> 04:58.305
You just don't know how to sell yourself.
Give me a minute.

05:09.692 --> 05:13.685
- So?
- Lf it was up to them, you'd die alone.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.263
- Great.
- Okay, here's the thing.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.632
If you want to play in this league,
you have to make a few changes.

05:20.703 --> 05:23.103
- Like what?
- Hang on.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.953
- Pretty much everything.
- Everything?

05:38.021 --> 05:41.821
Yep. The hair, the clothes,
the fuddy-duddy personality.

05:41.891 --> 05:43.722
What do they know about my personality?

05:43.826 --> 05:45.691
Okay, that part's mine.

05:46.496 --> 05:49.397
Face it, Alan,
you've been an old fart since you were 14.

05:49.499 --> 05:50.693
What is that supposed to mean?

05:50.800 --> 05:54.702
It means, how many eighth-graders
carry a briefcase and a pocket watch?

05:54.804 --> 05:56.965
That was the Esperanto Club look.

05:57.807 --> 06:00.799
Unless you know where
all the hot Esperanto chicks hang out,

06:00.877 --> 06:02.970
you're gonna need
to shake things up a little.

06:03.046 --> 06:06.311
Really? And how to do I go about
"shaking things up"?

06:06.382 --> 06:07.576
Hang on.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.392
This may take a while. Don't wait up.

06:23.332 --> 06:24.424
Hey, guess what?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.526
Coach Phil made me first-string
on the soccer team.

06:30.039 --> 06:33.406
- Is that so?
- Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I suck.

06:34.577 --> 06:37.239
Maybe Coach Phil sees some potential.

06:41.617 --> 06:45.053
- So, what else is new?
- Mom's got new clothes and new hair.

06:45.121 --> 06:47.351
It's like she's a different person
or something.

06:47.423 --> 06:50.358
- But she's still the same person, Jake.
- No, not really.

06:50.426 --> 06:53.259
She walks around the house
singing all the time.

06:54.197 --> 06:56.893
- She just sings for no reason?
- I guess.

06:57.266 --> 07:00.565
I wonder if it's the same reason
I sing for no reason.

07:02.572 --> 07:05.200
Does Coach Phil sing for no reason?

07:05.274 --> 07:07.265
For God's sake, Charlie!

07:08.411 --> 07:10.572
How come
you haven't changed anything yet, Dad?

07:10.646 --> 07:13.638
- Why should I change?
- So you'd look cool like Mom.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.082
- You don't think I look cool now?
- No.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.188
You know what,
it doesn't matter if I look cool,

07:20.256 --> 07:23.020
we judge a person by what's inside them,
not by what they wear.

07:23.092 --> 07:24.457
Lucky for you.

07:27.897 --> 07:29.159
Yeah, lucky.

07:29.265 --> 07:32.063
- I'm done. Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

07:35.004 --> 07:37.768
Help me, Charlie.
I want to sing for no reason.

07:41.644 --> 07:43.111
Get your jacket. It's time to go.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.238
I don't want to go. I hate clothes shopping.

07:45.314 --> 07:47.179
- You can't stay here alone.
- Why not?

07:47.283 --> 07:48.409
You know why not.

07:48.484 --> 07:51.817
But you don't have a turtle
to put in the microwave anymore.

07:53.189 --> 07:55.020
- Get your jacket.
- Fine.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.991
I'll put on my stupid jacket,
we'll get in the stupid car,

07:58.094 --> 07:59.755
and we'll go stupid clothes shopping.

07:59.829 --> 08:02.662
Hey, don't talk
to your stupid father like that.

08:04.634 --> 08:09.765
- So, you ready for your big makeover?
- You know what? Actually, I am.

08:09.839 --> 08:12.774
- I was up all night thinking about it.
- All night?

08:14.477 --> 08:17.105
Maybe your money's better spent
on a hooker.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.306
No, listen,

08:18.381 --> 08:21.111
I was in the bathroom,
looking at myself in the mirror,

08:21.184 --> 08:24.620
when I noticed, and I think I can be
completely objective about this,

08:24.687 --> 08:27.952
that I have a very nice ass
for a guy my age.

08:28.858 --> 08:33.659
And I think I should start dressing
in such a way as to play that card.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.558
You know, for the ladies.

08:39.835 --> 08:41.530
Go ahead, check it out.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.334
Am I lying?

08:47.343 --> 08:50.073
- Hi, Mom.
- Good, you remember me.

08:50.646 --> 08:53.513
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hey, Mom, right?

08:54.917 --> 08:57.909
Very cute. I was in the neighborhood,
I thought I'd stop by.

08:58.020 --> 09:00.853
I'm sorry, Mom. We were just leaving.

09:01.591 --> 09:03.183
It never fails, does it?

09:03.259 --> 09:06.660
Whenever I would like to spend
some quality time with my grandson

09:06.729 --> 09:09.027
there's always something
more important going on.

09:09.098 --> 09:10.224
It's not fair, you know.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.200
I'm not getting clothes,
so why do I have to go and be bored?

09:13.269 --> 09:15.100
You don't,
you can stay here with Grandma.

09:15.204 --> 09:16.364
- What?
- What?

09:17.006 --> 09:19.497
- Have fun.
- Wait, no, I'll be good, I swear.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.338
Payback's a bitch, buddy.

09:33.022 --> 09:36.253
- This department looks nice.
- You're sure?

09:36.359 --> 09:40.921
Because this is the top floor.
There's no more clothes above this floor.

09:41.130 --> 09:44.691
- No, I have a good feeling about this floor.
- Great.

09:45.968 --> 09:49.597
- How about this shirt?
- No, I don't think so.

09:52.408 --> 09:53.602
Okay.

09:54.377 --> 09:55.935
- How about this?
- No.

09:57.146 --> 09:58.443
Good.

09:59.548 --> 10:02.278
- This one?
- No.

10:04.053 --> 10:06.317
- This?
- No.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.482
Tell you what,
why don't you pick something?

10:09.592 --> 10:12.720
- I thought you were gonna help me?
- Pick something.

10:13.629 --> 10:16.792
Okay, flying solo.

10:46.262 --> 10:48.924
This is something
I could see myself wearing.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.156
- You like this?
- Yeah.

10:51.534 --> 10:52.933
Let me see that.

11:03.346 --> 11:07.874
Please, if she has one more facelift,
she'll be wearing her ass as a hat.

11:09.485 --> 11:11.646
Jake, honey,

11:12.054 --> 11:14.955
turn the TV down,
Grandmommy's on the telephone.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.683
I'm sorry, what?

11:19.228 --> 11:23.324
No, I'm just spending
a little quality time with my grandson.

11:24.700 --> 11:28.500
He's an amazing boy.
We're very close, two peas in a pod.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.903
What? Hold on.

11:36.178 --> 11:38.772
Jake, how old are you?

11:39.849 --> 11:42.113
- Ten.
- Seven.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.385
I said, "Ten. "

11:45.287 --> 11:47.687
If I'm 55, you're seven.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.283
He's an adorable boy,
and he just loves me so much.

11:52.561 --> 11:56.292
Jake, tell my friend, Cheryl,
how much you love Grandmommy.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.064
Go on, darling.

11:59.568 --> 12:00.865
I'm 10.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.401
How's it going in there?

12:06.475 --> 12:10.741
Whatever happened to zippers?
I miss zippers.

12:11.614 --> 12:15.141
I don't know, Alan.
Maybe there were too many injuries.

12:16.419 --> 12:21.152
Nobody ever got their balls
caught in a buttonhole.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.425
- Come on out, let's see.
- I'm just not sure about this.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.758
We're never gonna find the right
look for you unless we experiment.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.388
Now, let's see.

12:37.973 --> 12:40.168
I'm not happy with visible nipples.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.402
Yeah, that's what is wrong with it.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.598
That's it. We need a gay guy.

13:46.575 --> 13:50.011
His name is Sponge Bob Square Pants,
and his friend's name is Patrick.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.843
He's a starfish, and he lives
on the same street Sponge Bob,

13:52.915 --> 13:55.748
and he's unbelievably dumb.
Squidward lives there, too.

13:55.851 --> 13:58.115
Of course, he's a squid
and he hates Sponge Bob,

13:58.220 --> 13:59.448
and he plays the clarinet.

13:59.555 --> 14:03.252
Both Squidward and Sponge Bob
work at the Crusty Krab for Mr. Krab,

14:03.359 --> 14:05.623
who's really cheap,
but Sponge Bob doesn't care

14:05.728 --> 14:08.561
because he just likes being
a fry cook and making Krabby...

14:08.631 --> 14:10.531
So, bottom line,

14:11.734 --> 14:13.224
he's a sponge?

14:15.704 --> 14:16.762
Yeah.

14:16.872 --> 14:21.104
His pants are square 'cause he's square
and so is his underwear.

14:21.176 --> 14:23.610
They're tighty-whities, but they're square.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.606
- Oh, dear God.
- He has a pet snail named Gary, that...

14:28.484 --> 14:33.285
Okay, relax the shoulders, good.
The style suits you,

14:33.355 --> 14:35.915
the pants hang beautifully. Oh, dear.

14:36.759 --> 14:37.851
What?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.451
You're not gonna
be wearing those shoes, are you?

14:40.529 --> 14:42.121
- Say no.
- No.

14:42.598 --> 14:45.089
Could you show us some shoes
that will go with this?

14:45.167 --> 14:48.625
I'm sorry, I don't actually work here.
I came in for a belt.

14:51.173 --> 14:54.438
Okay, we got an outfit.
Let's go find some shoes.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.944
No, Charlie,
I'm done. I can't do this anymore.

14:57.012 --> 15:00.311
Don't worry. I'm sure there'll
be a gay guy in the shoe department.

15:00.382 --> 15:02.873
No, I've changed my mind.
I don't want new clothes.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.886
What? You look great.
That guy said you looked stunning.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.650
He said "fabulous,"
but that's not the point.

15:08.724 --> 15:11.215
- This is not who I am.
- Yeah.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.889
But who you are couldn't get laid
underwater with a tank full of oxygen.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.531
- Forget it, let's just go home.
- Wait a second.

15:18.634 --> 15:21.569
I spend all day schlepping
from store to store with you,

15:21.670 --> 15:24.298
listening to you whine,
and now that we finally found

15:24.373 --> 15:28.309
- something that works, you want to bail?
- I don't feel comfortable in this stuff.

15:28.377 --> 15:31.403
- I knew it. I knew you'd chicken out.
- Chicken out?

15:31.513 --> 15:34.573
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.584
At least your wife
had the guts to try something new.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.983
Don't go there, Charlie.

15:39.054 --> 15:41.648
I mean, the soccer coach
was kind of a sideways move,

15:41.724 --> 15:43.783
- but you gotta admire the effort.
- Fine.

15:43.892 --> 15:46.360
I will buy the stupid clothes,
but I'm never ever

15:46.428 --> 15:49.591
- going to do this with you again.
- Promise?

15:50.132 --> 15:52.862
I just hope he's worth all the drama.

15:57.773 --> 16:01.641
Hello. Mom, Jake?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.806
In here.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.210
Hello.

16:09.284 --> 16:10.979
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Alan.

16:11.487 --> 16:14.786
- Rose, what are you doing here?
- Babysitting.

16:15.157 --> 16:17.591
- Where's my mother?
- She left.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.594
- Why?
- I don't know.

16:19.662 --> 16:21.596
We were watching
Sponge Bob Square Pants,

16:21.664 --> 16:24.497
and she stood up and said,
"Life was too short. "

16:26.769 --> 16:29.567
Luckily, I happened to be out on the deck,

16:30.272 --> 16:33.298
not doing anything, just passing by,

16:33.909 --> 16:35.570
and she asked me to baby-sit.

16:37.513 --> 16:41.279
- Dad, you look cool.
- Really? You think?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.513
Yeah, very sexy.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.019
So where is Charlie?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.756
He dropped me off.
We had a little disagreement.

16:50.826 --> 16:52.851
Was it about those dorky shoes?

17:10.979 --> 17:13.038
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:14.016 --> 17:16.540
- Mind if I join you?
- Might as well.

17:17.685 --> 17:20.382
You're gonna have to drive me home.

17:21.690 --> 17:24.887
I just wanted to say that
I know you were just trying to help,

17:24.992 --> 17:26.722
and I appreciate it.

17:26.929 --> 17:28.021
Thanks.

17:28.097 --> 17:32.227
I just got a little panicky.
Change is not easy for me, Charlie.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.392
Really? I hadn't noticed.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.070
And I'm not just talking about the clothes.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.265
The clothes are only the tip of the iceberg.

17:39.374 --> 17:41.069
Only the tip of the iceberg.

17:41.276 --> 17:43.267
Leanne, I'm gonna need another shot.

17:44.747 --> 17:46.942
- Continue.
- Yeah, it's like,

17:47.049 --> 17:49.711
I was married a long time, Charlie.

17:49.785 --> 17:52.253
It's who I was, it was my identity,

17:52.354 --> 17:55.846
"Married Guy," "Husband Man,"
"Captain Dependable,"

17:56.558 --> 17:58.389
and I had a uniform.

17:58.594 --> 18:02.621
And, I don't know,
I guess, I just didn't want to take it off.

18:02.731 --> 18:05.894
'Cause you'd lose your powers
of dependability?

18:07.903 --> 18:12.636
- So, Charlie, who's your friend?
- My brother, Alan.

18:13.142 --> 18:16.043
Hi, Alan. I'm Leanne. It's nice to meet you.

18:16.111 --> 18:18.909
I've actually met you a bunch of times.

18:20.249 --> 18:22.240
No, I'd remember you.

18:22.317 --> 18:26.447
I come in here with Charlie all the time,
I always order a rum and Diet Coke?

18:29.024 --> 18:30.457
Right.

18:30.826 --> 18:33.420
So, Alan, the usual?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.930
No, today let's try something different.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.464
- Charlie, what are you having?
- Tequila shooters with a beer back.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.471
Great. I will have a rum and Diet Coke.

18:45.107 --> 18:46.768
You've got it, hon.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.175
Was she flirting with me?
I think she was flirting with me.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.714
I think there was definitely a connection.

18:53.816 --> 18:56.376
Alan, you do understand
she works for tips?

18:56.952 --> 18:59.443
- Rum and Diet Coke, please?
- Here.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.555
- Did you see that?
- What do you expect?

19:03.659 --> 19:06.651
You bought a sport jacket,
not a magic lamp.

19:30.886 --> 19:32.217
Hello.

19:34.156 --> 19:36.021
I didn't see you back there.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.862
Oh, yeah.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.108
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

20:22.371 --> 20:23.565
