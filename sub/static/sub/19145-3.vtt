WEBVTT

00:01.055 --> 00:02.614
Previously on Cardinal...

00:02.641 --> 00:03.939
Some of this was frenzy violence

00:04.139 --> 00:05.438
but some of it was purposeful.

00:05.461 --> 00:07.079
He was experimenting.

00:07.891 --> 00:09.102
Audio tape.

00:09.563 --> 00:11.114
If you were taking off for good,

00:11.180 --> 00:12.527
you'd bring your laptop.

00:12.727 --> 00:14.705
I'm telling you this
kid didn't run away.

00:14.905 --> 00:16.221
He went to do something.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.871
Or meet someone.

00:17.963 --> 00:20.354
My wife has bipolar disorder.

00:20.656 --> 00:22.688
I'm sorry. I had no idea that...

00:23.804 --> 00:26.015
Yeah, why did my mom
bring us a teddy bear?

00:26.249 --> 00:27.877
I might have let it slip, we're trying.

00:28.077 --> 00:31.357
This isn't your thing, Josh. You
don't make the decisions on your own.

00:31.713 --> 00:35.199
Find the link between
Cardinal and Corbett.

00:35.532 --> 00:36.564
What happened to your truck?

00:36.595 --> 00:37.774
I hit a squirrel.

00:38.228 --> 00:39.750
Why so much this time?

00:40.103 --> 00:42.861
He buys black market
chips, cashes them in.

00:42.915 --> 00:45.580
It shows how Cardinal
launders his rat money.

00:45.986 --> 00:48.522
He won't stop, not until we stop him.

00:49.408 --> 00:51.048
Nothing else matters.

00:51.361 --> 00:52.929
Could you walk me home?

00:53.173 --> 00:54.874
We can still drive away.

00:56.301 --> 00:58.095
We're doing this.

01:05.244 --> 01:08.780
<i> Took a walk to the
summit at night, </i>

01:08.814 --> 01:11.382
<i> you and I </i>

01:11.417 --> 01:15.954
<i> To burn a hole in the
old grip of the familiar, </i>

01:15.988 --> 01:19.057
<i> you and I </i>

01:19.091 --> 01:22.627
<i> And the dark was opening wide, </i>

01:22.661 --> 01:25.863
<i> do or die </i>

01:52.448 --> 01:54.749
This journey has taught me
more than I could imagine

01:54.783 --> 01:58.853
but why must we travel so
far to find what's within.

01:58.887 --> 02:00.321
It's not that bad.

02:00.355 --> 02:01.589
It's terrible.

02:01.623 --> 02:03.039
It's fake.

02:04.927 --> 02:06.027
Bend your knees.

02:06.061 --> 02:08.271
- Keep loose.
- I am.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.930
You're still looking at the
bottles. Just look at the sight.

02:14.955 --> 02:16.414
Focus on the sight.

02:18.907 --> 02:20.341
He's thinking,

02:20.375 --> 02:24.345
"I'm a guy in love so I
better act like a guy in love."

02:24.379 --> 02:25.713
And guys in love

02:25.747 --> 02:28.262
ask questions about what's within".

02:32.754 --> 02:34.055
It's just all a big show.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.923
What does she say back?

02:35.958 --> 02:37.266
A picture of a heart.

02:39.228 --> 02:40.501
He's making an effort.

02:41.396 --> 02:42.669
I think it's sweet.

02:47.911 --> 02:49.380
Are you sending that to her?

02:50.239 --> 02:51.205
Huh?

02:51.240 --> 02:52.767
Eric, why would you do that?

02:52.792 --> 02:55.831
I don't know, sometimes
I surprise myself.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.254
All right. Time to go.

03:28.838 --> 03:30.945
One moment of peace

03:30.979 --> 03:31.946
you have with her.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.993
She said, "I was never
in peace. I hated".

03:36.018 --> 03:37.285
She said, "I was driven by hate".

03:37.319 --> 03:38.366
Gran?

03:38.391 --> 03:39.287
Not towards you

03:39.321 --> 03:41.047
but towards other people.

03:41.323 --> 03:42.323
Gran?

03:42.750 --> 03:44.967
Yeh... That's why she silenced you.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.160
That's why she-she was like-

03:46.578 --> 03:48.462
If you're sleeping let's turn this off.

03:48.497 --> 03:50.698
She too had been through abuse.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.060
Did you go to Pozzies?

03:55.137 --> 03:57.038
Eric and I had something to do.

03:57.072 --> 03:58.072
Uh, is he here?

03:59.141 --> 04:00.606
Hello, you old yam.

04:01.043 --> 04:03.644
Oh, he should pay rent,

04:03.679 --> 04:04.679
he's here so much.

04:06.381 --> 04:07.968
God, you smell disgusting.

04:09.851 --> 04:11.319
I made a list.

04:12.387 --> 04:14.722
Sooner rather than later, Edie, huh?

04:55.564 --> 04:56.564
Keith?

04:58.433 --> 04:59.433
Wake up, Keith.

05:03.639 --> 05:04.639
He's still out.

05:10.212 --> 05:11.879
What time did you get home?

05:13.282 --> 05:14.282
Maybe midnight.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.117
I didn't want to wake you.

05:16.385 --> 05:17.385
Hm.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.690
Everybody was asking about you.

05:22.724 --> 05:24.358
I thought you were gonna join us.

05:24.393 --> 05:25.393
I was beat.

05:28.463 --> 05:30.264
Hey, are you smoking again?

05:30.299 --> 05:31.299
No, why?

05:32.734 --> 05:35.898
Uh, I just thought I
smelled it in the car.

05:39.408 --> 05:42.171
I shouldn't have told your mom
that we're trying to have a baby.

05:44.746 --> 05:45.746
I'm sorry.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.015
It's okay.

06:40.736 --> 06:42.803
The techs have uncovered

06:42.838 --> 06:45.973
an encrypted e-mail exchange
on Todd Curry's computer,

06:46.007 --> 06:47.174
something either Curry

06:47.209 --> 06:48.943
or the person Curry
was communicating with

06:48.977 --> 06:50.544
didn't want seen.

06:50.579 --> 06:51.545
They're working to crack it.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.949
So, did Curry meet the killer online?

06:54.983 --> 06:57.017
Let's be open to that idea.

06:57.052 --> 06:59.153
We do know he photographed Katie Pine.

06:59.187 --> 07:00.955
We can hear it on the audiotape.

07:00.989 --> 07:03.340
So, does he share
them? Does he post them?

07:03.425 --> 07:05.726
CES is scouring the internet but,

07:06.155 --> 07:08.936
if you hear of any snuff
photos, bondage, underage stuff,

07:09.006 --> 07:10.006
run it down.

07:10.248 --> 07:11.334
Cell phone trace?

07:11.359 --> 07:12.419
Sarge?

07:12.444 --> 07:15.256
A couple of days after
Curry arrived here

07:15.281 --> 07:17.738
he travelled due south
about eighty Kilometres

07:17.773 --> 07:22.042
and spent several hours
just outside of Dorset.

07:22.077 --> 07:24.345
McLeod, I want you down
there to have a look around.

07:24.379 --> 07:28.716
Hannam, the seeing impaired
traffic signals are mapped.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.084
You'll run that canvass.

07:30.118 --> 07:32.186
Take ah, Fox and Leddy with ya,

07:32.220 --> 07:33.187
knock on every door.

07:33.221 --> 07:34.355
Any questions?

07:34.704 --> 07:35.915
Good. Go.

07:37.893 --> 07:39.415
So am I with you today?

07:39.462 --> 07:41.228
Oh, one last thing.

07:41.263 --> 07:44.031
Ah, tips are coming in from
the public by the truckload.

07:44.065 --> 07:45.242
Anything comes your way,

07:45.267 --> 07:47.168
pass it along to Detective Delorme.

07:47.579 --> 07:49.392
I want a written tip sheet on every one.

07:54.910 --> 07:55.910
Yes sir.

07:59.381 --> 08:00.631
Does he know?

08:02.951 --> 08:04.637
Yesterday he was your biggest fan,

08:04.662 --> 08:06.587
today he's burying you in sups.

08:06.621 --> 08:08.122
Is that so you don't have enough time

08:08.156 --> 08:10.105
to follow your own investigation?

08:12.093 --> 08:14.295
Can I run something by you?

08:14.329 --> 08:15.563
I was going over the dates and...

08:15.597 --> 08:17.842
Yep. Hello? Hello?

08:20.101 --> 08:21.584
Uh, the dates.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.270
Yeah.

08:23.839 --> 08:26.407
Billy LaBelle to Katie
Pine was five months.

08:26.441 --> 08:28.642
Katie Pine to Todd Curry, three months.

08:28.677 --> 08:30.166
Todd Curry to now...

08:30.191 --> 08:31.378
The answer is yes.

08:31.413 --> 08:33.246
He might have already struck again.

08:44.078 --> 08:45.821
Maybe I gave him too much.

08:58.974 --> 09:00.407
I know how we can wake him.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
Should I?

09:14.422 --> 09:16.257
The thing about the pinky

09:16.291 --> 09:17.779
is that there's a nerve

09:17.804 --> 09:19.093
that runs all the way up the arm.

09:19.127 --> 09:20.327
It's called the ulnar nerve.

09:22.097 --> 09:24.932
If I cut it, he'll jolt
up like he's on fire.

09:28.470 --> 09:29.470
What do you say?

09:35.343 --> 09:36.343
Edie,

09:37.045 --> 09:38.045
talk.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.147
I have to go to work.

09:48.490 --> 09:49.690
I thought we were waiting.

09:51.359 --> 09:52.927
I thought that's what you wanted.

09:52.961 --> 09:55.596
So you just stand there
like a dumb animal?

09:55.630 --> 09:57.368
I thought we were waiting.

10:03.305 --> 10:04.305
Go to work.

10:07.642 --> 10:08.900
Eric.

10:08.925 --> 10:10.144
It's not enough,

10:10.178 --> 10:11.645
you know,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.314
to get a little thrill out of this?

10:14.816 --> 10:15.948
A little

10:16.718 --> 10:18.355
tingle in your loins.

10:21.156 --> 10:22.122
'Cause guess what?

10:22.157 --> 10:23.390
Anybody does.

10:23.425 --> 10:24.892
You put this in front of anybody

10:24.926 --> 10:25.926
and they'll watch.

10:27.495 --> 10:29.279
So don't think that makes you special.

10:33.835 --> 10:36.682
- Why are you being like this?
- Because.

10:37.049 --> 10:39.039
Ha... Because...

10:39.941 --> 10:40.941
it's not enough

10:42.110 --> 10:43.641
to be a spectator.

10:44.679 --> 10:45.679
It's boring.

10:47.616 --> 10:49.316
I thought you were more.

10:49.351 --> 10:50.351
I am.

10:52.253 --> 10:53.253
Go to work.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.217
Know where you're going?

11:11.444 --> 11:12.406
Okay so just get 'em talking,

11:12.440 --> 11:15.109
see how they feel about
having a cop at their door.

11:15.143 --> 11:17.277
Anyone seem especially
nervous, make a note.

11:17.312 --> 11:18.545
Too confident, make a note.

11:21.282 --> 11:23.517
- Questions?
- No.

11:23.551 --> 11:24.518
Report back to me.

11:24.552 --> 11:25.552
Move out.

11:28.323 --> 11:29.590
Cardinal.

11:29.624 --> 11:30.591
Hey, John,

11:31.063 --> 11:32.954
that location where
Todd Curry travelled,

11:33.662 --> 11:35.195
there's nothing here.

11:35.230 --> 11:36.196
What do you mean nothing?

11:36.231 --> 11:37.197
Describe it to me.

11:37.232 --> 11:38.198
I'm telling ya,

11:38.233 --> 11:39.867
road, lake,

11:39.901 --> 11:41.635
trees, pipe,

11:41.670 --> 11:43.871
railroad tracks and
power lines to the west.

11:43.905 --> 11:45.205
He spent five hours there.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.874
There has to be something. A shed?

11:46.908 --> 11:47.875
Something.

11:47.909 --> 11:48.976
Maybe he was hitchhiking.

11:49.010 --> 11:50.744
Got this far, ran out of luck

11:50.779 --> 11:51.912
so he headed back to town.

11:51.946 --> 11:54.553
All right. Uh, you went all that way,

11:54.578 --> 11:56.884
just do me a favour and
dig around a bit, will ya?

11:56.918 --> 11:57.918
Will do.

12:01.356 --> 12:02.356
And I'm done.

12:22.811 --> 12:23.946
You recognize this.

12:25.547 --> 12:26.547
It was Katie's.

12:28.316 --> 12:29.817
Where did you find it?

12:29.851 --> 12:31.151
On Windigo Island,

12:31.186 --> 12:32.453
near the mineshaft.

12:32.487 --> 12:33.487
Is that helpful?

12:34.622 --> 12:37.091
Sometimes a predator will use gifts

12:37.125 --> 12:38.125
to lure a victim.

12:38.860 --> 12:39.960
If that were the case,

12:39.994 --> 12:42.529
then this might point
us in his direction.

12:42.564 --> 12:43.530
No.

12:43.565 --> 12:44.995
It was Katie's.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.900
She bought it over a year ago.

12:48.636 --> 12:49.870
That boy they found,

12:49.904 --> 12:52.606
was he killed by the same man?

12:52.640 --> 12:54.475
We have reason to believe so, yes.

12:55.009 --> 12:56.276
Katie have a...

12:56.311 --> 12:57.511
an online friend?

12:57.545 --> 12:59.146
Someone she might have

12:59.180 --> 13:00.180
met on the Internet?

13:01.483 --> 13:03.020
You checked her computer.

13:03.418 --> 13:05.114
Maybe she used one at school?

13:06.566 --> 13:07.799
Like a secret friend?

13:09.891 --> 13:10.958
I knew her friends.

13:10.992 --> 13:11.992
She would have told me.

13:14.662 --> 13:15.662
So,

13:16.397 --> 13:18.341
the killer maybe used a bracelet.

13:19.701 --> 13:21.038
Or maybe a computer.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.437
Or maybe none of those things?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.125
We are making progress, Dorothy.

13:31.012 --> 13:32.012
So is he.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.142
My goodness.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.417
It lives.

14:02.267 --> 14:03.267
Hey.

14:04.603 --> 14:06.571
I'm so sorry about last night.

14:06.605 --> 14:07.605
That's on me.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.073
I'm sorry.

14:09.108 --> 14:10.108
I get a little...

14:10.943 --> 14:12.226
chippy when I drink.

14:13.278 --> 14:14.586
No hard feelings?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.317
Where am I?

14:19.351 --> 14:21.887
You're at Edie's house.

14:21.926 --> 14:23.864
You remember Edie, with the face?

14:27.192 --> 14:28.526
You must have had a few too many

14:28.560 --> 14:30.762
because you got pretty sick.

14:30.796 --> 14:32.130
They were gonna bounce you to the curb,

14:32.164 --> 14:33.542
so we brought you here.

14:36.469 --> 14:38.282
What time is it?

14:38.537 --> 14:40.813
It's, um, eczema by the way.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.476
Uh, you were too polite to ask, but I'm

14:45.511 --> 14:47.138
pretty sure that you were wondering.

14:48.289 --> 14:50.014
Where are my clothes?

14:50.049 --> 14:51.949
Uh, you puked all over them so

14:51.984 --> 14:53.184
I put them in the wash.

14:54.653 --> 14:55.687
I should probably make a call.

14:55.721 --> 14:56.988
Do you know where my phone is?

14:57.022 --> 14:58.556
Uh, no sorry, I didn't find a phone,

14:58.590 --> 15:00.863
but you can use the one
upstairs if you want.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
Ugh.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.328
Ah. Yeah.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.332
You're probably pretty dehydrated.

15:06.732 --> 15:09.019
You puked up a lot of fluids.

15:10.269 --> 15:11.269
Here.

15:15.741 --> 15:16.741
Take your time.

15:17.843 --> 15:19.360
There you go.

15:20.412 --> 15:22.696
I'd bring you the phone but
it's mounted to the wall.

15:23.582 --> 15:24.582
It's old school.

15:26.852 --> 15:27.852
Is it, uh,

15:29.054 --> 15:31.189
Claire you wanted to speak to?

15:31.223 --> 15:32.223
Girlfriend?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.384
Did I tell you about her?

15:36.228 --> 15:37.762
You told me a lot of things.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.033
Oh. Oh.

15:42.134 --> 15:45.036
Looks like we're gonna lose you again.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.504
Wait, before you go,

15:46.538 --> 15:47.939
I do want to show you something.

15:54.913 --> 15:55.913
Hey.

15:56.548 --> 15:58.082
A little preparation in this area

15:58.117 --> 15:59.646
saves everyone a lot of trouble.

16:00.552 --> 16:01.753
I learnt that the hard way.

16:03.122 --> 16:04.831
Do you know what this is?

16:06.992 --> 16:07.992
It's for you, Keith.

16:09.795 --> 16:10.995
So you don't make a mess.

17:05.784 --> 17:06.818
It's twenty past, Margo.

17:06.852 --> 17:08.685
I know. I'm sorry. My ride fell through.

17:09.555 --> 17:11.095
Happens way too much.

17:11.390 --> 17:12.390
Last time.

17:12.491 --> 17:13.391
Promise.

17:15.794 --> 17:17.617
Thanks a lot for punching me in.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.997
You didn't ask.

17:20.031 --> 17:21.031
I asked last week.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.468
Consider it a standing request, Edie.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.703
I'll do the same for you.

17:26.371 --> 17:27.538
I'm never late.

17:27.573 --> 17:30.975
Well, that is part of
a larger conversation.

17:30.997 --> 17:32.330
Do you have any gum?

17:35.256 --> 17:37.894
You work a s**t job,

17:37.980 --> 17:39.128
All you ever do is,

17:39.218 --> 17:40.518
do what you're told.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.597
Time to reassess, son.

17:49.995 --> 17:50.995
Do you want one?

17:51.663 --> 17:52.663
No thanks.

17:56.835 --> 17:58.035
It looks really red today.

17:59.438 --> 18:00.438
Does it hurt?

18:05.210 --> 18:06.605
It's just the cold.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.081
Yes, but let me just
back up, Mrs. Talbot.

18:10.115 --> 18:11.916
So you're a hundred percent sure

18:11.950 --> 18:14.642
that what your neighbour
was carrying was a machete.

18:15.687 --> 18:17.552
Yes, but you could
tell from that distance?

18:19.358 --> 18:20.324
Yes. Okay.

18:20.359 --> 18:21.359
Well, I have your number so

18:21.393 --> 18:23.694
I'll call you if we need to follow up.

18:23.729 --> 18:24.729
Thank you.

18:26.598 --> 18:27.832
So?

18:27.866 --> 18:29.867
What do the good people of
Algonquin Bay have to say?

18:31.203 --> 18:33.271
Not all tips are useless.

18:33.305 --> 18:35.448
Some are useless and racist.

18:37.042 --> 18:38.442
I thought you were number two on this.

18:40.045 --> 18:41.311
I'm paying my dues.

18:42.047 --> 18:44.348
Well, don't take it personally.

18:44.383 --> 18:46.183
We're lucky to have
a Toronto UC big shot

18:46.218 --> 18:47.373
showing us how it's done.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.121
Cardinal worked UC?

18:51.823 --> 18:54.358
I didn't see that in his history.

18:54.393 --> 18:55.663
Uh, deep cover.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.295
I mean, the kind of stuff

18:57.329 --> 18:58.562
that doesn't end up on your CV.

19:04.859 --> 19:06.437
Hey, Paul, it's Lise, how are you?

19:06.471 --> 19:07.438
Good.

19:07.472 --> 19:08.606
Uh, listen,

19:08.707 --> 19:11.275
my new Sergeant's got me
organizing a roast for this uh,

19:11.310 --> 19:14.278
detective who's coming
up on twenty years.

19:14.313 --> 19:15.813
I want to track down his old partners

19:15.847 --> 19:18.282
but his case history seems to be buried.

19:18.317 --> 19:20.329
You think you could get that for me?

19:21.086 --> 19:22.086
Great.

19:22.754 --> 19:24.664
Yeah, his name is John Cardinal.

19:40.439 --> 19:41.439
Hello beautiful.

19:49.815 --> 19:50.815
I saw Kelly.

19:54.386 --> 19:55.386
She sends her love.

19:57.122 --> 19:58.122
Oh.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.936
Hey, listen,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.031
what do you need these days to

20:07.065 --> 20:08.666
process 35 mil film?

20:10.502 --> 20:11.502
To do it all yourself?

20:12.471 --> 20:14.960
Yeah. Say you're taking
pictures that are private.

20:16.508 --> 20:19.443
Well, you need some space, for starters.

20:19.478 --> 20:22.113
For a darkroom.

20:22.147 --> 20:23.981
I haven't done it in years.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.350
Chemicals, papers, trays.

20:26.385 --> 20:27.451
Huh.

20:27.486 --> 20:28.853
Who carries that stuff?

20:28.887 --> 20:30.936
Are you working right now?

20:33.325 --> 20:34.325
It could help me.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.364
I'm tired.

21:11.196 --> 21:12.163
Keith.

21:12.197 --> 21:13.197
Keith.

21:14.866 --> 21:15.866
It's a long exposure,

21:15.901 --> 21:18.102
if you move it's gonna be blurry.

21:21.273 --> 21:22.840
Oh, Jesus.

21:24.810 --> 21:26.510
Not that I want you to be still,

21:26.545 --> 21:28.412
I just want you to do what's natural.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.752
Okay. Look.

21:37.989 --> 21:39.356
What did you say your name was?

21:39.391 --> 21:40.581
I didn't say.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.029
Okay.

21:45.063 --> 21:47.264
Okay, I don't know if you
got the wrong impression,

21:47.299 --> 21:48.933
but this is not my sort of thing.

21:49.668 --> 21:50.634
Oh no?

21:53.071 --> 21:55.731
I don't know if I did
something to piss you off.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.575
Like what?

21:59.578 --> 22:01.112
I don't know if I said something.

22:01.146 --> 22:02.213
If we got into it.

22:02.247 --> 22:03.926
Does this feel like a spat to you?

22:04.516 --> 22:06.817
Is this how spats are
settled in your house?

22:06.852 --> 22:09.320
I just don't know what you want from me.

22:12.257 --> 22:13.487
Hey, hey.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.727
You might.

22:16.761 --> 22:17.962
Look at me. Look at me.

22:19.431 --> 22:20.631
Hey, hey, shh, shh.

22:21.482 --> 22:22.600
You might know.

22:23.335 --> 22:25.448
If you're honest with yourself,

22:25.770 --> 22:27.666
you might actually know.

22:29.174 --> 22:30.174
Ah!

22:37.282 --> 22:39.116
Hello! Anybody home?

22:54.299 --> 22:55.266
Hi, ma'am.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.433
I'm Constable Fox.

22:56.468 --> 22:57.668
How are ya this afternoon?

22:58.537 --> 22:59.703
What's this about?

22:59.738 --> 23:01.305
Well, we're just out
canvassing the area,

23:01.339 --> 23:02.940
making sure everybody's feeling safe

23:02.974 --> 23:05.809
with everything going on
in the news these days.

23:05.844 --> 23:07.060
Down here!

23:07.201 --> 23:08.312
Down here!

23:08.346 --> 23:09.395
Your husband uh...

23:09.420 --> 23:10.545
My husband?

23:10.873 --> 23:11.782
What?

23:11.816 --> 23:13.708
Is your husband here?

23:13.752 --> 23:15.466
My husband is dead.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.226
I will slice you wide open.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.128
Just you then, in the house?

23:24.162 --> 23:25.296
Oh, with my granddaughter.

23:25.330 --> 23:26.336
Oh, okay.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.465
Oh, she's not in trouble?

23:29.573 --> 23:30.720
Shh.

23:31.903 --> 23:32.903
What is it you want?

23:37.609 --> 23:39.043
Ah, thanks for your time, ma'am.

23:42.847 --> 23:43.847
Sorry to bother you.

23:56.361 --> 23:57.728
Please. Please.

23:57.762 --> 23:59.697
Hey, you're wasting your energy.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.943
It's out of my hands.

24:13.378 --> 24:14.876
This is Edie's show now.

24:18.316 --> 24:19.550
I know she doesn't look like much,

24:20.752 --> 24:21.752
but she's ready.

24:23.255 --> 24:24.255
You'll see.

24:34.232 --> 24:35.432
She just needs a little nudge.

25:07.421 --> 25:08.421
See that?

25:08.956 --> 25:10.790
Do you see the impact?

25:10.825 --> 25:12.959
The whole side there is caved in.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.160
Direct hit.

25:14.195 --> 25:15.662
That's a sturdy animal.

25:15.696 --> 25:17.843
Would have blown their airbags for sure.

25:18.366 --> 25:20.725
Then off they went. Didn't call it in.

25:20.935 --> 25:22.874
Just let her die in the cold.

25:24.438 --> 25:25.695
I'll look into it.

26:04.011 --> 26:05.876
What the hell are you doing here?

26:05.901 --> 26:07.845
A raid on Corbett's operation.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.128
An officer died.

26:09.153 --> 26:10.848
You and Cardinal worked it.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.684
Look, what am I missing here?

26:15.252 --> 26:17.453
I can't do my job if
you keep me in the dark.

26:28.132 --> 26:29.999
The raid went bad

26:30.033 --> 26:31.905
because of Cardinal.

26:33.137 --> 26:34.137
How?

26:35.439 --> 26:38.441
Corbett was setting up a
new supply line in Toronto.

26:38.475 --> 26:39.942
My team covered this side.

26:39.977 --> 26:41.077
Cardinal was part of a

26:41.111 --> 26:42.986
crew down there, undercover.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.347
We worked it for months.

26:44.381 --> 26:45.348
Set up a

26:45.382 --> 26:47.083
sting based on what
Cardinal was feeding us.

26:47.117 --> 26:48.584
We were gonna get Corbett,

26:48.619 --> 26:49.986
his new supplier,

26:50.020 --> 26:52.183
a big shipment, all in one go.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.093
Cardinal's intel was bad?

26:57.127 --> 26:58.542
Yeah. I guess you could say that.

26:59.696 --> 27:01.097
When we arrived,

27:01.131 --> 27:02.331
no Corbett,

27:02.366 --> 27:03.332
no drugs,

27:03.367 --> 27:04.500
nothing,

27:04.535 --> 27:07.736
except a half pound of
C-4 rigged to a wire.

27:10.307 --> 27:12.341
Officer's name was Julian Burwell,

27:12.376 --> 27:13.476
27 years old.

27:13.510 --> 27:14.678
He died instantly.

27:15.345 --> 27:16.312
So Cardinal got burned.

27:16.346 --> 27:17.313
- No.
- It happens.

27:17.347 --> 27:20.021
No. He warned them we were coming.

27:21.518 --> 27:23.686
Cardinal was using disposable phones.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.022
We couldn't get the wires
up fast enough so he was

27:26.056 --> 27:27.323
taping them with a portable.

27:27.357 --> 27:29.125
You know him now, you
know how thorough he is,

27:29.159 --> 27:33.729
he had a file for
every call, except one.

27:33.764 --> 27:35.698
Day before the raid he
talks to his inside guy

27:35.732 --> 27:37.182
for six minutes.

27:37.434 --> 27:38.434
Phone records show it.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.618
There's no tape of the call.

27:44.241 --> 27:46.175
He tipped them off, Delorme,

27:46.210 --> 27:48.273
and he erased the evidence.

27:51.448 --> 27:53.149
And what did SIU say?

27:53.183 --> 27:54.517
Oh, Cardinal said the

27:54.551 --> 27:55.551
recorder malfunctioned.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.303
They couldn't prove
otherwise so they dropped it.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.535
He was living a double life, Delorme.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.564
Sick wife at home,
kid at a fancy school,

28:08.599 --> 28:09.872
bills piling up, okay?

28:09.897 --> 28:10.897
He lost his way.

28:13.203 --> 28:14.503
He took a payoff.

28:27.217 --> 28:29.051
You're not authorized to go after him.

28:31.221 --> 28:34.023
I have broad discretion.

28:34.057 --> 28:35.458
Yeah, to get Corbett.

28:35.492 --> 28:36.859
- Cardinal was cleared.
- He did it.

28:36.893 --> 28:38.745
- No, he was cleared.
- He did it.

28:40.497 --> 28:41.731
You can't just re-open it.

28:42.666 --> 28:44.437
Not without cause.

28:46.069 --> 28:47.406
Then find me some.

28:49.006 --> 28:51.285
That's why there is no paper on this.

28:52.242 --> 28:53.832
It's not even supposed to be happening.

28:55.145 --> 28:57.035
Well I was told you had good instincts.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.028
It's why I brought you on.

29:02.686 --> 29:04.287
If you think

29:04.321 --> 29:06.289
Cardinal is clean then you should just

29:06.323 --> 29:07.651
walk away.

29:08.492 --> 29:10.339
Go back to financial.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.296
No hard feelings, I promise.

29:14.831 --> 29:16.232
But I am telling you,

29:16.266 --> 29:18.801
he is in the middle of all this

29:18.835 --> 29:20.836
and I think you know it.

29:55.893 --> 29:57.167
Francis Kestejoo?

30:00.166 --> 30:01.277
Aw, come on, man.

30:01.311 --> 30:02.445
Where you gonna run to?

30:05.082 --> 30:06.082
Idiot.

30:16.993 --> 30:17.993
Ugh.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.552
What's the story here, Francis?

30:21.932 --> 30:23.209
None of your business.

30:24.334 --> 30:25.904
I'm unconvinced.

30:29.906 --> 30:31.574
An SLR and a guitar.

30:31.608 --> 30:32.575
You're like,

30:32.609 --> 30:34.717
the coolest guy from 1993.

30:35.345 --> 30:37.580
I think the '90s are a really

30:37.614 --> 30:38.614
underrated decade.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.950
The last analogue era.

30:43.186 --> 30:44.587
So do you play that thing or

30:44.621 --> 30:45.692
is it just a prop?

30:46.857 --> 30:47.890
That's a mean question.

30:47.924 --> 30:49.258
Oh, so you don't play.

30:50.412 --> 30:51.494
I didn't say that.

30:51.528 --> 30:52.495
I'm all right but uh,

30:52.529 --> 30:54.473
this is my instrument.

30:55.203 --> 30:56.203
I play people.

30:57.367 --> 30:58.934
You really didn't just say that.

30:58.969 --> 30:59.969
I did.

31:00.704 --> 31:02.816
I capture people at their most honest.

31:05.242 --> 31:06.242
That's rare today.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.777
Don't you think?

31:08.779 --> 31:11.013
People living in the moment,

31:11.047 --> 31:12.214
being raw,

31:12.249 --> 31:13.249
not performing.

31:14.284 --> 31:15.473
I capture that.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.159
So is this the part

31:18.184 --> 31:20.319
when you ask to take pictures of me?

31:22.993 --> 31:23.993
Would you like that?

31:29.232 --> 31:30.433
You work at the music store, right?

31:31.268 --> 31:34.203
You should come by sometime
and bring your pictures.

31:34.237 --> 31:35.237
I'll take a look.

31:39.679 --> 31:41.043
Never mind.

31:41.077 --> 31:42.077
You wouldn't like them.

31:50.287 --> 31:52.121
I wasn't freezing you
out today, Delorme.

31:53.356 --> 31:54.990
If this case breaks,

31:55.025 --> 31:56.325
it'll be something out of left field,

31:56.359 --> 31:59.929
some fragment that tumbles off the pile.

31:59.963 --> 32:01.752
That first wave of tips is key.

32:03.033 --> 32:04.600
Yeah, well, nothing came of it.

32:04.634 --> 32:05.768
Maybe not.

32:05.802 --> 32:08.337
But because it's you, I
didn't have to double-check.

32:08.371 --> 32:09.405
Detectives, uh,

32:09.439 --> 32:11.574
I just got a call from
Major Crimes in Toronto.

32:11.608 --> 32:13.242
Melissa and Douglas London.

32:13.276 --> 32:14.610
Their son, Keith,

32:14.644 --> 32:16.111
was supposed to arrive home last night,

32:16.146 --> 32:17.446
never turned up.

32:17.481 --> 32:18.447
Coming from here?

32:18.482 --> 32:20.115
No. Uh, well, yeah,

32:20.150 --> 32:21.283
he passed through but,

32:21.318 --> 32:22.284
he's not here now.

32:22.319 --> 32:23.285
He passed through?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.320
Coming from out west.

32:24.354 --> 32:25.521
Ah, they ran his cell.

32:25.555 --> 32:27.156
He got here last night,

32:27.190 --> 32:28.657
left this morning and he went east

32:28.692 --> 32:30.159
to a spot outside Deux Rivieres,

32:30.193 --> 32:33.195
then his signal died and nothing since.

32:34.231 --> 32:35.798
Who did you talk to in Toronto?

32:35.832 --> 32:36.832
Get them back on the line.

32:36.867 --> 32:37.867
McLeod,

32:38.401 --> 32:39.935
that place Curry went,

32:39.970 --> 32:41.036
there were train tracks, right?

32:41.071 --> 32:42.938
Yeah, there's a little
spur line there off the 11.

32:42.973 --> 32:43.939
Lise. Lise.

32:43.974 --> 32:44.974
Yeah?

32:47.043 --> 32:48.043
Curry's phone

32:50.146 --> 32:51.747
went out in the middle of nowhere

32:54.584 --> 32:55.551
and there it sat

32:55.585 --> 32:57.286
for five hours until it died.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.787
Keith London's phone

32:58.822 --> 33:00.623
went east also

33:00.657 --> 33:01.657
along the rail line

33:02.526 --> 33:03.526
until it died.

33:04.494 --> 33:06.927
But then Curry turns up back here.

33:07.898 --> 33:08.864
No, he never left.

33:08.899 --> 33:09.899
His phone did.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.867
The killer puts phones

33:11.902 --> 33:13.569
on trains to throw us off.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.719
He has his next victim.

34:19.161 --> 34:20.065
Be quiet.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.893
Be quiet!

34:47.103 --> 34:48.210
Thank you.

34:56.152 --> 34:57.453
It's Edie, right?

35:04.661 --> 35:05.661
Why am I here?

35:08.050 --> 35:09.365
Bad luck.

35:12.034 --> 35:13.448
The cops were here before,

35:13.487 --> 35:14.804
at the door.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.038
Your friend heard them too.

35:18.295 --> 35:19.742
- How?
- I don't know.

35:19.777 --> 35:20.777
But they were here.

35:22.179 --> 35:24.013
That means they're
watching. They'll be back.

35:28.118 --> 35:31.536
Look, you can let me go, okay?

35:31.561 --> 35:34.157
We can put all of this behind us.

35:34.191 --> 35:35.770
You think I'm stupid?

35:37.294 --> 35:38.294
No.

35:39.784 --> 35:40.861
But sometimes

35:40.886 --> 35:43.065
people get into things and
they don't know how to get out.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.936
Is he making you do this?

35:49.278 --> 35:50.773
'Cause if he is, it's not your fault.

35:51.802 --> 35:52.875
You'll be forgiven.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.849
All you had to do

36:16.982 --> 36:18.267
was walk me home.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.221
None of this would be happening.

36:35.302 --> 36:36.619
Please.

36:38.816 --> 36:40.160
Please.

36:40.185 --> 36:41.956
Please, Edie, please.

36:41.981 --> 36:43.092
I can't help you.

36:57.143 --> 36:58.960
I'm gonna make you some food.

36:58.985 --> 36:59.985
You have to eat.

37:01.054 --> 37:02.054
House rules.

37:15.735 --> 37:16.702
John?

37:16.736 --> 37:17.703
Todd Curry's e-mail.

37:17.737 --> 37:18.737
We got it.

37:19.038 --> 37:20.305
IP says west side.

37:20.340 --> 37:22.132
Warrant's in process for the address.

37:23.443 --> 37:24.688
She's 19.

37:24.817 --> 37:26.367
First correspondence,

37:26.880 --> 37:30.182
was this summer and last correspondence

37:30.216 --> 37:32.281
was January 6th.

37:32.421 --> 37:34.624
Hm. Three days before he was killed.

37:36.122 --> 37:37.122
Too many I's.

37:39.025 --> 37:39.992
Too many me's.

37:40.026 --> 37:41.026
What?

37:41.294 --> 37:42.361
In Financial,

37:42.395 --> 37:45.257
we see honey trap fraud
like this all the time.

37:46.266 --> 37:48.398
Guys pretending to be girls.

37:49.869 --> 37:51.670
Should I run a gender analysis?

37:51.704 --> 37:54.106
So the program is
looking for certain words,

37:54.140 --> 37:55.574
punctuation styles.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.252
And, how long does this take?

37:57.977 --> 38:00.618
Sometimes upwards of five seconds.

38:02.594 --> 38:03.625
It's a guy.

38:03.650 --> 38:05.876
Todd Curry was corresponding with a guy.

38:06.102 --> 38:09.156
Sarge? Got the address.
42 Copeland Drive.

38:09.556 --> 38:10.946
Okay. Go.

38:28.996 --> 38:30.715
He's smart. The guy is smart.

38:30.777 --> 38:33.885
He knew if he kept hunting
locally we'd spot his pattern.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.710
So he starts picking
guys from out of town.

38:35.745 --> 38:37.045
First Todd Curry,

38:37.079 --> 38:38.079
now Keith London.

39:52.455 --> 39:53.455
Yes?

39:55.424 --> 39:56.424
Ugh!

39:57.159 --> 39:58.159
Idiot!

40:17.761 --> 40:18.827
He's not our guy.

40:18.861 --> 40:20.395
You're absolutely sure?

40:20.430 --> 40:22.297
Yeah, he pretends to be a woman online,

40:22.332 --> 40:24.599
strikes up relationships with young men.

40:24.634 --> 40:26.001
And this one blew up on him

40:26.035 --> 40:28.070
when Curry came to meet in person.

40:28.104 --> 40:30.672
And he went. What was he expecting?

40:30.707 --> 40:32.107
They had been chatting for months.

40:32.141 --> 40:35.277
He'd convinced himself that
Curry knew that they were

40:35.311 --> 40:37.372
role-playing together.

40:37.613 --> 40:39.514
Yeah, imagine Curry's reaction.

40:39.549 --> 40:41.783
Expects a 19-year-old girl.

40:41.818 --> 40:44.119
Finds that guy instead.

40:44.153 --> 40:45.687
Well maybe he went after Curry

40:45.722 --> 40:46.822
out of shame or

40:46.856 --> 40:48.857
fear that he might be exposed.

40:48.891 --> 40:50.792
No. He and his wife
left for Bangor, Maine,

40:50.827 --> 40:51.827
the next day.

40:52.395 --> 40:54.696
He wasn't here when Curry died.

40:54.731 --> 40:56.665
So this is the guy
who lured him to town,

40:56.699 --> 40:58.200
but not the one who killed him.

40:58.234 --> 40:59.554
Looks like it.

41:53.055 --> 41:54.256
You know not to come here.

41:54.424 --> 41:55.624
I have to talk to you.

41:57.393 --> 41:58.794
We shouldn't be seen together.

42:00.229 --> 42:01.714
Are you embarrassed by me?

42:02.031 --> 42:03.031
No.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.100
Edie.

42:06.202 --> 42:07.202
No.

42:09.305 --> 42:11.265
We just have to be cautious, okay?

42:12.575 --> 42:13.775
Now, come on, let's go.

42:33.229 --> 42:34.229
I made him bleed.

42:35.498 --> 42:36.498
For you.
