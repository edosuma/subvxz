WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.344
<i>in front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.449 --> 00:05.579
Me first, Mama. Now,
after years of trying

00:05.673 --> 00:06.947
and failing and trying again,

00:06.995 --> 00:08.805
I finally found you
the perfect birthday gift.

00:08.853 --> 00:10.540
Okay, Bobby, don't put too much on it.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.454
Ooh. Luther Vandross's

00:12.533 --> 00:14.649
entire box set.

00:14.805 --> 00:17.602
Vanilla scented candles,
some bubble bath.

00:17.712 --> 00:21.611
Ooh, and some chocolate covered
strawberries.

00:21.699 --> 00:23.462
Oh, Bobby, these are great gifts

00:23.540 --> 00:26.337
if you're trying to seduce our mother.

00:26.649 --> 00:29.524
Look, Jerrod, diminishing sex life
in elderly couples

00:29.626 --> 00:31.032
is the number one cause of divorce.

00:31.102 --> 00:34.026
Is that what you want?
Sexless divorced parents?

00:34.133 --> 00:36.194
See, that's why Bobby,
you my favorite.

00:36.242 --> 00:39.173
You're not only my son,
but you my wingman.

00:40.149 --> 00:42.165
- Body oil.
- Ooh.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.516
I can't wait for your birthday

00:43.587 --> 00:44.859
to turn into your birth-night.

00:44.907 --> 00:46.337
- (laughs)
- Come here, girl.

00:46.385 --> 00:47.595
(smooches)

00:47.751 --> 00:48.753
Boys,

00:48.801 --> 00:50.408
we might just give you a little brother

00:50.456 --> 00:51.509
on this couch.

00:51.557 --> 00:53.255
(laughs)

00:53.702 --> 00:54.902
Sorry.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.044
All right,

00:56.062 --> 00:57.646
happy birthday, Cynthia.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.293
We wanted to be sure to get you
something really special.

01:00.341 --> 01:01.725
Oh, look at this fancy bag.

01:01.773 --> 01:04.296
It's all shiny and metallic.

01:04.403 --> 01:06.538
I like it so far.

01:09.724 --> 01:10.935
What is this?

01:11.021 --> 01:14.927
This is a limited
first edition hardcover

01:14.975 --> 01:16.401
of Jacqueline Kennedy's biography.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.834
MAXINE: Yeah, you know,
'cause you're always talking about

01:17.881 --> 01:20.287
how pretty she was and
how much you admire her.

01:23.013 --> 01:24.622
I don't understand.

01:24.911 --> 01:27.646
Have I wronged you in some way?

01:28.497 --> 01:29.857
(laughs): What? No.

01:29.916 --> 01:32.825
You know what would be a better
gift than that? A Kindle.

01:32.958 --> 01:35.677
See, while you're pretending
to read, you can enjoy the apps,

01:35.755 --> 01:37.769
the games, the e-mails, and more.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.224
- Oh.
- Yes, a Kindle can do it all.

01:40.306 --> 01:42.529
And I heard that you
can even watch movies

01:42.583 --> 01:43.872
on those things now.

01:43.989 --> 01:47.029
Oh, can you imagine me with a Kindle?

01:47.138 --> 01:49.481
Oh, some day.

01:51.865 --> 01:55.607
Sure, Kindles are fine, but
what's wrong with a book?

01:55.787 --> 01:58.556
Jerrod, don't make me
say that out loud.

01:58.708 --> 02:00.135
Say what out loud?

02:00.380 --> 02:02.494
You really gonna make
her say it out loud?

02:03.005 --> 02:04.435
On her birthday?

02:04.591 --> 02:06.873
Say what out loud?
What are you guys talking about?

02:06.982 --> 02:10.044
Look, Jerrod, your gift is stupid...

02:11.437 --> 02:14.052
because black people
don't read like that.

02:14.349 --> 02:16.165
Why do you make him say
these kind of things?

02:16.213 --> 02:16.996
Mm-hmm.

02:17.044 --> 02:18.685
Okay, you're joking, right?
'Cause that's the most

02:18.732 --> 02:20.076
racist thing I've ever heard.

02:20.124 --> 02:21.880
(squeals): Oh, Joe!

02:22.013 --> 02:24.489
You got me a Kindle movie watcher.

02:24.537 --> 02:26.724
(laughs)

02:26.772 --> 02:29.560
- Oh, I could just cry.
- (laughs)

02:29.771 --> 02:32.615
See, that's why I set the
Kindle up before, you know?

02:32.724 --> 02:35.716
I set my pins up and I knock 'em down!

You guys have the audacity to say

02:54.076 --> 02:56.320
"black people don't read like that"?

02:56.368 --> 02:57.865
W-What does that even mean?

02:57.977 --> 02:59.447
Well, we read some things.

02:59.511 --> 03:02.638
Like if I'm at the dentist's
office and my phone dies,

03:02.770 --> 03:05.613
I may scan through a copy of <i>Essence</i>

03:05.685 --> 03:08.872
or read a pamphlet
on tooth decay.

03:09.201 --> 03:10.654
Yeah, look, let's me honest, man.

03:10.748 --> 03:12.732
Black people didn't start
going to the library

03:12.818 --> 03:14.474
until the library got Internet.

03:14.547 --> 03:16.193
- Facts.
- Those are not facts.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.732
Okay, this is incredibly insulting.

03:18.846 --> 03:22.341
Well, that's why black people
like <i>The Cosby Show</i> so much.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.779
It was just mystical seeing
all those people reading

03:25.888 --> 03:27.802
and being doctors.

03:28.302 --> 03:30.771
It took me to a fantastical place

03:30.857 --> 03:33.341
I'd never been before.

03:33.786 --> 03:37.388
<i>The Cosby Show was my Star Wars.</i>

03:37.721 --> 03:40.404
Uh, <i>The Cosby Show was supposed to be</i>

03:40.506 --> 03:42.958
a realistic portrayal
of a black family.

03:43.095 --> 03:45.130
No...

03:45.848 --> 03:47.916
Is that what they were going for?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.138
You think we proud of this?

03:50.349 --> 03:53.271
No, this is an embarrassment
that black people would rather

03:53.305 --> 03:56.693
sweep under the rug, like Stacey Dash.

03:56.807 --> 04:00.310
Okay. This is all just a
offensive generalization.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.771
Black people read all the time.

04:01.819 --> 04:03.552
Jerrod reads, I read.

04:03.675 --> 04:06.154
Well, that's one
and a half black people.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.044
I mean, those are not
record-breaking numbers, Maxine.

04:10.092 --> 04:12.208
And to be totally honest, Maxine,

04:12.257 --> 04:15.005
I wasn't gonna even
read my birthday cards.

04:16.091 --> 04:17.771
Happy birthday, Cynthia.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.932
- Oh, thank you, Nekeisha.
- JERROD: Nekeisha, Nekeisha, please,

04:19.978 --> 04:21.411
answer this question for us, okay?

04:21.567 --> 04:23.794
How many black people
do you know that read?

04:23.886 --> 04:25.020
Uh, you mean, like,

04:25.084 --> 04:26.451
- when they don't have to?
- Yes.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.396
- Like, reading just for fun?
- Yes.

04:28.463 --> 04:29.928
You mean, like, reading just to read?

04:29.975 --> 04:32.849
Yes, Nekeisha, reading
for the sake of reading.

04:32.947 --> 04:34.089
Mm, that's a tough one.

04:34.137 --> 04:36.439
Does <i>Essence Magazine</i> count?

04:36.487 --> 04:37.568
Told you.

04:37.616 --> 04:39.122
Th-that's nothing to be proud of.

04:39.249 --> 04:40.935
For all your bragging about reading,

04:40.985 --> 04:43.810
your knowledge of black people
is on a fifth grade level.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.852
Yeah, Jerrod, why you
acting like this is news?

04:46.900 --> 04:50.570
Listen, there are some things
black people just don't do.

04:50.618 --> 04:51.818
No. No, no, Dad.

04:51.866 --> 04:54.982
We do not have a set of
rules we need to abide by.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.200
Sure we do.

04:56.248 --> 04:57.982
- We don't ski.
- Mm-mm.

04:58.029 --> 04:59.154
We don't let dogs lick

04:59.216 --> 05:00.935
- all up on our faces.
- Oh, no.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.076
And under no circumstances

05:03.163 --> 05:06.083
do we ever, ever drive a Subaru.

05:07.513 --> 05:10.574
You know, they say dogs' mouths
are cleaner than humans,

05:10.622 --> 05:12.530
but I think white
people just saying that

05:12.578 --> 05:15.161
to justify their actions.

05:16.715 --> 05:19.076
See, there's all sorts
of rules, Jerrod.

05:19.138 --> 05:21.773
Like, you got to say
all black movies are good,

05:21.821 --> 05:22.826
even if they bad.

05:22.874 --> 05:24.958
Yeah, yeah. You got to
assume all cops are bad,

05:25.006 --> 05:26.271
even when they good.

05:26.342 --> 05:27.552
We don't like halibut.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.685
Well, we don't eat halibut.

05:28.733 --> 05:32.802
Okay, no one eats halibut.
It's a very dry fish.

05:33.091 --> 05:35.131
Okay, sorry. I was just
getting a little frustrated.

05:35.411 --> 05:36.478
JERROD: So, wait.

05:36.529 --> 05:38.403
You guys really want to live in a world

05:38.404 --> 05:40.231
where black people only do things

05:40.279 --> 05:41.520
other black people approve of?

05:41.568 --> 05:43.052
- Oh, I love black approval.
- JOE: Yeah.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.778
Mm-hmm. Nothing wrong with that.

05:44.826 --> 05:47.247
See, Jerrod, these rules,
they have purpose.

05:47.349 --> 05:49.583
They bind us as a community.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.981
They unite us against
the threat of a white culture

05:53.029 --> 05:55.021
that brought us here as slaves.

05:55.638 --> 05:57.668
Dad, that's the most
eloquent explanation

05:57.716 --> 06:00.372
I've ever heard for not reading.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.724
You know, it would be nice if
we could just say what we think

06:04.786 --> 06:06.864
without black people getting
mad. Like this one time,

06:06.911 --> 06:08.146
when I went to the hair salon,

06:08.194 --> 06:10.022
and I said Michelle
Obama should smile more,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.179
and the bitch cut me with scissors.

06:11.226 --> 06:12.779
Mmm.

06:14.638 --> 06:15.832
JOE: Well, now,

06:15.880 --> 06:17.958
if you gonna talk smack about Michelle,

06:18.006 --> 06:19.139
prepare to get cut.

06:19.223 --> 06:20.341
JERROD: No, Pop.

06:20.389 --> 06:22.156
Nekeisha should be
able to think and say

06:22.210 --> 06:23.669
whatever she wants without judgment.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.091
We all should. I mean, Ma,

06:25.139 --> 06:26.459
I know you got a thought in there

06:26.506 --> 06:28.311
that black people wouldn't approve of.

06:28.552 --> 06:31.294
I do, but I don't want
to say it out loud.

06:31.342 --> 06:32.966
Ooh, I wouldn't mind hearing this.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.568
"Unpopular black thoughts."

06:34.616 --> 06:36.116
It sound like a fun podcast.

06:36.197 --> 06:38.833
(scoffs) Cynthia,
you're in a safe place.

06:38.936 --> 06:40.136
No one here's gonna judge you.

06:40.194 --> 06:42.095
Yeah, Ma, go ahead. Free yourself.

06:42.232 --> 06:43.841
Fine.

06:44.134 --> 06:46.208
(clears throat)

06:47.161 --> 06:51.168
I don't think Denzel Washington
is that talented an actor.

06:52.484 --> 06:56.153
He just plays Denzel in every movie.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.786
I'm just asking for a little range.

07:00.591 --> 07:03.318
Look, Mom, wow, you've
been holding onto that.

07:03.630 --> 07:05.849
Yeah. I've got that off my chest.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.060
I feel a lot lighter, less stressed.

07:08.122 --> 07:09.177
(laughs)

07:09.225 --> 07:11.201
I bet you all this suppression is what

07:11.272 --> 07:13.439
causes high blood pressure
in the black community.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.107
Who else has an unpopular
black thought?

07:15.194 --> 07:16.928
Bobby, I know you got something.

07:17.139 --> 07:18.154
Are we doing this?

07:19.474 --> 07:20.559
Now, look, one day,

07:20.607 --> 07:23.177
there was a bunch of young black
dudes standing near my car.

07:23.255 --> 07:24.522
And you know what I did?

07:25.435 --> 07:26.927
I went back in their Starbucks,

07:27.048 --> 07:28.865
got me a Peppermint Hot Chocolate,

07:28.913 --> 07:31.349
and I waited that thing out.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.335
Well, Bobby, that one was
definitely a little racist,

07:35.383 --> 07:37.351
but you got every right to say it.

07:37.755 --> 07:39.849
You didn't see them boys, Jerrod.

07:42.091 --> 07:43.453
Look, this is good.

07:43.454 --> 07:45.576
I feel like we're making
so much progress, right?

07:45.740 --> 07:48.025
You know what? Instead
of going to Niecy's,

07:48.026 --> 07:49.779
like we always do
for your birthday, Ma,

07:49.834 --> 07:51.224
let's go somewhere else.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.247
Every year, we go to Niecy's
for my birthday,

07:54.317 --> 07:56.252
ever since Coretta Scott King

07:56.318 --> 07:59.474
ate there for her birthday, 1972.

07:59.841 --> 08:02.763
Niecy's is a staple
in the black community.

08:02.927 --> 08:05.177
But let's break the rules.
Niecy's will be there.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.411
We can go anywhere.

08:06.459 --> 08:08.402
We can even go to
Florentine's if you want.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.271
Florentine's?

08:11.683 --> 08:13.411
No...

08:13.943 --> 08:16.177
We can't eat at Florentine's.

08:16.354 --> 08:17.688
Could we?

08:17.826 --> 08:19.060
Why can't we?

08:19.144 --> 08:21.745
Because black people
don't eat there, that's why.

08:21.926 --> 08:24.365
We barely even drive
through the neighborhood.

08:24.614 --> 08:26.583
Come on, Dad.
We got to stop thinking like that.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.208
Florentine's is a great restaurant.

08:28.271 --> 08:30.294
And you would like it
and it's Mom's birthday.

08:30.454 --> 08:32.147
You think we can even get reservations?

08:32.195 --> 08:33.256
It's so last minute.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.397
Yeah. My buddy, Drew, from high school,

08:35.445 --> 08:36.389
his family owns the place.

08:36.437 --> 08:37.429
All I got to do is text him.

08:37.477 --> 08:38.398
I'm sure he can get us in.

08:38.446 --> 08:41.171
Oh, my God, are we doing this?

08:41.570 --> 08:44.507
We are crossing racial barriers

08:44.649 --> 08:47.337
that this family has
never crossed before.

08:47.532 --> 08:49.750
Oh, I know how Sidney Poitier felt

08:49.798 --> 08:51.251
when he got that Oscar.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.391
Ooh!

08:53.506 --> 08:56.602
Now, that's an actor with range.

08:58.704 --> 09:03.501
(sighs) I'm gonna go upstairs
and put on an even nicer outfit!

09:04.512 --> 09:06.613
I cannot believe my little brother

09:06.692 --> 09:08.587
is getting us into Florentine's.

09:08.806 --> 09:10.494
I knew you going to
the integrated high school

09:10.541 --> 09:13.032
would pay off some day.

09:13.179 --> 09:16.114
Yeah, I'm taking my
wife to Florentine's.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.181
You paying for this, right?

09:22.453 --> 09:24.521
Oh, this place is nice!

09:24.522 --> 09:28.245
They keep their Christmas
lights up the whole year round.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.972
Man, Niecy's don't even have a doorman.

09:30.246 --> 09:32.814
Mm, last time I was at Niecy's,
they didn't have a door.

09:32.964 --> 09:37.363
Any place where the employees
look happy makes me suspicious.

09:37.545 --> 09:38.878
Well, I want to see the bathroom.

09:38.932 --> 09:40.432
I bet they have granite countertops

09:40.511 --> 09:44.269
and those paper towels
that are more towels than paper.

09:44.519 --> 09:46.067
Baby, grab some of those
for the house, please.

09:46.114 --> 09:47.730
Okay, baby. I will.

09:48.042 --> 09:49.106
DREW: Yo!

09:49.159 --> 09:50.580
- Look at this guy.
- What up, man?

09:50.628 --> 09:52.800
Hey, thanks so much for
getting us in here, my man.

09:52.848 --> 09:54.281
Hey, anything for you, my nigga.

09:54.485 --> 09:55.772
You know that.

09:55.936 --> 09:57.450
All right, I got to run.

09:57.505 --> 09:58.737
We're gonna take great care of you.

09:58.784 --> 10:00.051
Yeah.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.802
BOBBY: Jerrod,

10:06.926 --> 10:08.457
what the hell was that?

10:08.526 --> 10:10.593
There it is. I'm out.

10:11.669 --> 10:14.004
Remember when I told you
black people don't eat here

10:14.052 --> 10:15.552
and you asked me why?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.729
(pops)

10:18.862 --> 10:21.589
Your server will be over to take
your drink orders shortly.

10:21.765 --> 10:23.866
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

10:27.315 --> 10:29.097
Why do you guys
keep staring at me like that?

10:29.273 --> 10:30.978
Come on. Just sit down.
Everything's fine.

10:31.026 --> 10:32.542
Don't ruin Mom's birthday.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.577
(sighs)

10:38.585 --> 10:41.335
So you gonna just let white
people call you "nigga," huh?

10:42.905 --> 10:45.588
I knew you shouldn't have went
to that integrated high school.

10:46.389 --> 10:47.999
I guess we better get out of here.

10:48.077 --> 10:49.492
No, Dad, Dad, Dad.

10:49.655 --> 10:52.328
All right, you're overreacting.
We don't have to leave.

10:52.632 --> 10:53.930
Okay, Drew is my friend.

10:53.931 --> 10:55.991
That's just how we talk.
I'm completely cool with it.

10:56.038 --> 10:59.007
Jerrod, when a white man
uses the "N" word,

10:59.085 --> 11:00.990
that is a fire alarm
in a burning building

11:01.038 --> 11:03.600
that you need to get out of.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.195
Maxine, will you please tell
them they're overreacting?

11:06.243 --> 11:07.910
No, your dad is absolutely right.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.858
I'm-I'm not comfortable
eating at a place

11:09.936 --> 11:12.046
where one of the owners
casually says that word.

11:12.163 --> 11:13.444
You know, we don't have to be outraged

11:13.491 --> 11:14.718
every time we hear the word, all right?

11:14.765 --> 11:15.939
That's just another black rule

11:15.986 --> 11:17.663
that hurts us more than it helps us.

11:17.754 --> 11:20.608
Ooh, this place, it's incredible!

11:20.756 --> 11:23.499
There was a container of
mints in the bathroom.

11:23.553 --> 11:25.436
I almost took one.

11:25.499 --> 11:27.389
Can you imagine how nice a place is

11:27.444 --> 11:30.333
if you want to eat in the bathroom?

11:31.569 --> 11:34.522
What? Where's Nekeisha?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.733
Why you all so silent?

11:38.561 --> 11:40.366
(clicks tongue) I'm sorry, Cynthia,

11:40.538 --> 11:41.881
but we have to leave.

11:42.022 --> 11:43.407
Ow!

11:45.194 --> 11:47.154
Why would you want to take me away

11:47.202 --> 11:48.421
from a nice place like this?

11:48.485 --> 11:50.702
Tell me. Why, Maxine? Why?!

11:50.888 --> 11:52.100
JERROD: Maxine,

11:52.194 --> 11:53.960
don't upset Mom on her birthday.

11:54.044 --> 11:57.038
That's right.
Do not upset Mom on her birthday.

11:57.178 --> 11:59.389
And don't tell me no bad news.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.197
I don't care
if it's a terrorist attack,

12:01.245 --> 12:02.445
I don't want to hear about it.

12:02.553 --> 12:05.822
We'll pray for the victims
and the family after we eat.

12:06.202 --> 12:09.671
Well, unfortunately, it's much
worse than a terrorist attack.

12:09.913 --> 12:12.499
Jerrod was racially slurred
when you were in the bathroom.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.844
Lord, no! On my birthday?

12:14.928 --> 12:15.965
I'm afraid so.

12:16.013 --> 12:18.647
Dad, stop. I wasn't slurred, okay?

12:18.733 --> 12:20.591
Yes, my friend Drew called me "nigga,"

12:20.639 --> 12:23.586
but he said it in a sweet
and loving type of way.

12:23.756 --> 12:25.821
Jerrod, you know
I don't like that word at all,

12:25.905 --> 12:28.824
but we cannot stop your
generation from saying it.

12:28.936 --> 12:30.678
Yeah, Mom, but it's a twist to it.

12:31.023 --> 12:32.357
Drew is white.

12:32.405 --> 12:35.531
(gasps) Sweet shepherd of Jesus!

12:37.678 --> 12:39.256
On my birthday?

12:40.045 --> 12:42.725
Jerrod, how can you be so
nonchalant about that word?

12:42.773 --> 12:45.741
It has such an intense
history of hate.

12:45.835 --> 12:48.131
It's the last word that
so many black people heard

12:48.186 --> 12:49.645
as they were being hung from trees.

12:49.717 --> 12:51.014
Okay, I don't think the problem

12:51.083 --> 12:53.208
in that scenario is the word,
Maxine.

12:53.304 --> 12:54.553
I think it's the hanging.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.131
All right? If you ask me,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.716
the black community gets
way too caught up on that word.

12:58.764 --> 13:00.105
It's just a distraction.

13:00.207 --> 13:02.077
We should focus on things
that actually matter,

13:02.124 --> 13:04.000
like, I don't know, voter suppression,

13:04.048 --> 13:06.583
instead of Hulk Hogan,
or Dog the Bounty Hunter,

13:06.662 --> 13:08.417
or Justin Timberlake
saying the "N" word.

13:08.568 --> 13:11.771
Oh, no! JT said it, too?

13:12.350 --> 13:14.303
Well, he hasn't said it...

13:14.561 --> 13:16.982
yet, but come on.

13:17.857 --> 13:19.701
Look, look, look the point is,

13:19.834 --> 13:21.959
you guys saying black
people don't read like that

13:21.982 --> 13:24.959
is way more offensive than
someone saying the "N" word.

13:25.061 --> 13:26.692
I've known Drew for a really long time.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.270
He's had nothing but black friends.

13:28.318 --> 13:29.803
He's dated nothing but black girls.

13:29.857 --> 13:31.709
I mean, the man has on
a fresh pair of Jordan 11's

13:31.756 --> 13:32.764
with a suit right now.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.572
He's embraced black
culture more than anyone.

13:34.659 --> 13:36.582
Well, just because you
appropriate our culture

13:36.662 --> 13:38.725
doesn't mean that
you can use our words.

13:38.842 --> 13:40.128
He is not black.

13:40.207 --> 13:42.331
And if you haven't experienced
the pain of that word,

13:42.388 --> 13:44.068
then you do not have
the right to say it.

13:44.187 --> 13:46.154
CYNTHIA: She is right, Jerrod.

13:46.335 --> 13:49.157
They called me that word
when I was the only black girl

13:49.287 --> 13:50.811
in my fifth grade class.

13:50.912 --> 13:53.780
I went to school every day
knowing that I was not welcome,

13:53.828 --> 13:55.229
and that's what that word is.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.608
It's a sign that you are not welcome.

13:58.318 --> 14:01.053
Well, I'm sorry you had to
go through that, Cynthia.

14:01.748 --> 14:03.795
You know what, I'm just
gonna go and get our coats,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.357
and I will meet you all out front.

14:05.584 --> 14:07.467
We just can't stay, Jerrod.

14:07.939 --> 14:10.178
Why is it every time Maxine is right,

14:10.226 --> 14:11.748
we all have to suffer?

14:13.711 --> 14:16.240
Yeah, we should have
just gone to Niecy's.

14:16.345 --> 14:18.311
Ooh, but it's gonna
be hard to eat there

14:18.359 --> 14:19.818
after I have experienced

14:19.866 --> 14:21.811
all this elegance today.

14:21.881 --> 14:23.990
You guys sound like you don't
actually want to leave.

14:24.038 --> 14:25.216
Do you really want to

14:25.264 --> 14:27.537
or do you just feel obligated
to as black people?

14:27.642 --> 14:29.376
Well, I feel obligated.

14:29.604 --> 14:32.897
You see how mad Maxine is
and she only half black.

14:33.683 --> 14:36.342
Does that mean I got
to be double angry?

14:36.695 --> 14:38.115
Well, yeah, those are the rules.

14:38.357 --> 14:40.858
Your anger has to match your melanin.

14:41.008 --> 14:42.123
Jerrod, look at your skin.

14:42.171 --> 14:44.272
You should be furious right now.

14:48.397 --> 14:49.982
Enjoy.

14:54.606 --> 14:58.592
Damn, that bread looks warm.
You think they made it in-house?

14:58.687 --> 15:00.855
Of course they made it in-house.

15:01.132 --> 15:03.670
Look at the cartoonish amount of steam

15:03.718 --> 15:06.220
rising off the backs of them rolls.

15:06.415 --> 15:08.092
God, I'm hungry.

15:08.159 --> 15:09.659
You know, Dad, if you want a roll,

15:09.707 --> 15:11.139
you could just take a roll.

15:11.230 --> 15:13.982
Oh, what a dilemma.

15:14.457 --> 15:15.791
This must be what it felt like

15:15.839 --> 15:19.130
to sit at that Woolworth's
counter in the '60s.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.670
- I'm just gonna...
- Joe.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.638
have a bite, 'cause,
you know, my blood sugar's low.

15:26.285 --> 15:29.271
Mmm. This is for you, Greensboro Four.

15:29.565 --> 15:32.667
This is for all the lunches
you were never served.

15:34.781 --> 15:36.818
Good God.

15:37.263 --> 15:39.564
- They're pretzel rolls, baby.
- Oh!

15:39.917 --> 15:41.271
A pretzel roll? Mmm.

15:41.364 --> 15:43.107
Very ambitious.

15:43.326 --> 15:45.105
This restaurant is taking some swings.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.153
CYNTHIA: Mm-hmm.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.910
Oh, nailed it.

15:49.753 --> 15:53.675
This makes the oppression
go down a whole lot easier.

15:54.159 --> 15:55.190
Mmm.

15:55.238 --> 15:57.108
Uh, why are you guys still sitting?

15:57.156 --> 15:58.585
I was waiting out front.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.528
Now, look, Maxine, I know what we said

16:00.576 --> 16:03.420
about oppression
and us having the integrity

16:03.468 --> 16:05.420
to stand up for ourselves
as black people.

16:05.478 --> 16:08.346
But that's before
I tried this pretzel roll.

16:09.979 --> 16:12.717
This is honey butter, Maxine.

16:14.236 --> 16:17.835
I'm sure you should be able to
relate to this dilemma, right?

16:17.913 --> 16:18.913
What?

16:18.960 --> 16:21.061
Would you like
sparkling water or still?

16:21.109 --> 16:22.756
Oh, why would you even ask?

16:22.846 --> 16:25.944
Of course we'd like the sparkling.

16:29.273 --> 16:30.514
Mmm!

16:30.706 --> 16:33.545
It tastes like healthy Sprite.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.667
Would you care to hear
about our specials today?

16:38.714 --> 16:40.483
Um, can you just please
give us a second?

16:40.531 --> 16:42.199
Of course. Take your time.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.758
Maxine, don't you see

16:43.806 --> 16:46.131
that by making a big
deal about this word,

16:46.179 --> 16:47.772
you're just giving it power?

16:47.930 --> 16:50.311
You're basically giving someone
a weapon to hurt you with.

16:50.359 --> 16:52.593
I mean, we can't control
who says the word,

16:52.641 --> 16:54.803
but we can control our reaction to it.

16:55.024 --> 16:56.678
You know what I think?
I think everyone

16:56.726 --> 16:58.139
should just use the word constantly.

16:58.186 --> 17:00.545
So much until it dilutes its power,

17:00.663 --> 17:02.428
makes it meaningless.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.631
I'll know we've come a
long way as a nation

17:04.741 --> 17:07.069
the day I turn on <i>Ellen and she says,</i>

17:07.186 --> 17:11.116
"Ladies and gentlemen,
my nigga, Bruno Mars."

17:11.491 --> 17:13.952
And all the soccer moms
in the audience cheer.

17:14.563 --> 17:16.413
Well, Jerrod makes a good point.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.256
Look, in ninth grade,

17:18.435 --> 17:21.366
my friend, Kevin, was called
that word by a white guy,

17:21.498 --> 17:24.092
and he beat his face
until it was unrecognizable.

17:24.256 --> 17:28.280
Just the way I taught you boys.
I am so proud of Kevin.

17:28.929 --> 17:30.630
Yeah, but Kevin got expelled.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.132
And you know what he's doing now?

17:32.272 --> 17:33.303
Selling drugs?

17:33.944 --> 17:36.452
Maxine, that is racist.

17:37.874 --> 17:39.626
But that's exactly what he's doing.

17:40.616 --> 17:43.710
Look, you see, Maxine?
This is exactly what I mean.

17:43.827 --> 17:46.146
Obsessing over the word
just ruins people's lives.

17:46.194 --> 17:48.702
Now, the only people
you'll be punishing

17:48.795 --> 17:51.013
by making us take a stance
against this restaurant

17:51.061 --> 17:52.652
is my family, who won't be able

17:52.700 --> 17:54.654
to eat a nice meal
on my mom's birthday.

17:54.795 --> 17:58.741
No, the people who are punished
are the victims of that word.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.241
(sighs)

18:01.499 --> 18:05.031
You know, I don't know if
I told you this, but...

18:05.308 --> 18:07.557
when I was 16, my swim
team made it all the way

18:07.605 --> 18:09.222
to the state championship.

18:09.449 --> 18:11.144
And just before the final meet,

18:11.464 --> 18:13.464
a white kid from the other team yelled,

18:13.636 --> 18:14.974
"Hey, what are you doing here?

18:15.022 --> 18:16.596
'N' words can't swim."

18:16.909 --> 18:18.683
Except he actually said the word.

18:19.449 --> 18:20.909
And it zapped all my confidence.

18:20.995 --> 18:23.917
That day, I swam the worst
time of my entire life.

18:24.074 --> 18:27.287
I was so upset that I...

18:27.288 --> 18:30.256
eventually quit swim team.

18:31.969 --> 18:34.661
Wait. <i>That</i> was your story?

18:38.149 --> 18:41.201
That wasn't inspiring at all.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.766
Yeah, I thought it was gonna be
a story of triumph, Maxine.

18:43.867 --> 18:45.813
Yeah, why are you telling us

18:45.867 --> 18:49.227
your story of not rising
to the occasion?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.765
This is a story of how damaging

18:51.813 --> 18:53.780
that word can be to someone's spirit.

18:53.781 --> 18:55.382
It is used to humiliate us,

18:55.383 --> 18:57.384
and we can't just ignore that fact

18:57.385 --> 18:59.831
- because we like a dinner roll!
- DREW: Hey, Jerrod.

18:59.909 --> 19:01.611
I'm just checking in.
Now, be sure to let me know

19:01.658 --> 19:02.488
- if you need any...
- Hey!

19:02.529 --> 19:03.790
We are not niggers!

19:10.901 --> 19:12.393
Maxine is right.

19:12.566 --> 19:14.734
We should probably leave.

19:19.917 --> 19:23.058
I can't believe we are
back up in Niecy's again.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.831
They still got a sandwich
named after O.J. Simpson.

19:27.464 --> 19:29.086
What the hell are we doing in here?

19:29.206 --> 19:30.611
Well, we're definitely not allowed back

19:30.658 --> 19:32.089
at Florentine's any time soon.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.706
Yeah. I've been sitting here 30 minutes

19:34.792 --> 19:37.698
and nobody's come over
for my drink order.

19:37.753 --> 19:39.276
(sighs)

19:39.620 --> 19:41.948
Look, I'm sorry that
I got us kicked out.

19:42.003 --> 19:43.347
But, you know, they didn't deserve

19:43.394 --> 19:44.480
- our business anyway.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:44.527 --> 19:48.409
We already heard about your
failed swimming career, Maxine.

19:49.698 --> 19:50.972
Look, I don't know

19:51.079 --> 19:52.995
if white people should
be saying the "N" word,

19:53.089 --> 19:55.323
but I definitely know
Maxine shouldn't say it.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.394
The way you said it, it hurt my soul.

19:58.644 --> 19:59.878
JOE: Hear! Hear!

20:00.019 --> 20:01.667
I'd like to toast to that,

20:01.776 --> 20:04.054
but we haven't gotten our drinks yet.

20:04.206 --> 20:07.159
Maxine, why did you have to
put the "E-R" on the end?

20:07.225 --> 20:08.269
Yeah.

20:08.317 --> 20:09.979
Drew didn't say it like that.

20:10.027 --> 20:12.117
There was actual hate in
your voice when you said it.

20:12.313 --> 20:13.781
Yours is like the curb-stomping scene

20:13.828 --> 20:16.159
from <i>American History X.</i>

20:16.979 --> 20:18.667
It wasn't hate towards black people.

20:18.862 --> 20:20.420
It was hate towards your friend.

20:20.550 --> 20:24.237
Well, Maxine, hate is hate,
and it's hurtful on all of us.

20:24.398 --> 20:25.917
Excuse me.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.662
Would you happen to have
some sparkling water?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.166
WAITER: Come on.

20:30.214 --> 20:33.729
You know we ain't got
no sparkling water.

20:35.135 --> 20:36.894
Yeah, I-I know.

20:37.190 --> 20:38.792
Well, could I have a Sprite?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.526
We got Pepsi.

20:41.636 --> 20:45.753
Oh, Lord, I miss Florentine's.

20:46.558 --> 20:48.002
Got me on my birthday,

20:48.050 --> 20:51.097
up here eating with all these niggas.
