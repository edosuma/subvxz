00:54.429 --> 00:59.015
Abigail was getting stronger,
just like she promised,

00:59.017 --> 01:01.935
fighting for more and more control.

01:07.275 --> 01:12.362
A battle of wills was brewing
between Maria and her demon

01:12.364 --> 01:16.950
to decide just whose body this really is.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.399
Give me that.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.821
Ahh! Mmm.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.242
Oh, finally.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.661
That's what I've been waiting for.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.496

02:22.817 --> 02:25.852
Do I look like anybody's baby girl?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.355
Who the hell are you?

02:31.359 --> 02:36.195
It depends. Buy me a drink, sailor?

02:36.197 --> 02:39.365
I can think of about a
dozen things to do to you.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.034
And buying you a drink ain't one of 'em.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.702
Mmm.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.898
Oh!

03:11.900 --> 03:13.900
Ah!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.368
Whoa.

03:15.370 --> 03:17.487
We do it my way.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.988
Ah, whatever you want.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.907
I've had 3,000 years of practice.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.158
I know exactly what I want.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.087
Ah! Oh, that burns.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.757
We're just getting started.

03:49.571 --> 03:53.606
Abigail.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.609
Where am I?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.535
I'm sorry.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.204
The Devil will try to
seduce you at every turn

04:08.206 --> 04:10.540
to charm and deceive
you into doing his work.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.958
Amen.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.594
You must all take a hard look at yourselves

04:14.596 --> 04:19.048
and push back against the evil
that is swallowing up our city.

04:22.270 --> 04:26.773
Amen! Amen, preach on, brother man.

04:26.775 --> 04:29.942
You know, the good reverend
speaks the truth, folks.

04:29.944 --> 04:34.731
Yes, yes, there is evil in this city,

04:34.733 --> 04:37.650
but what he won't tell you

04:37.652 --> 04:41.320
is that it's closer than you think.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.289
Do I know you?

04:43.291 --> 04:48.628
No. No, but I know you.

04:48.630 --> 04:51.664
Tell me, does it hurt
to be in the house of God

04:51.666 --> 04:53.466
when you're the Devil?

People tell themselves

06:02.897 --> 06:06.032
we're not always
responsible for our actions,

06:06.034 --> 06:08.818
but just because there's
a devil on your shoulder

06:08.820 --> 06:10.620
whispering in your ear

06:10.622 --> 06:13.156
doesn't mean you have to listen,

06:13.158 --> 06:16.959
no matter how sweet the words.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.050
I think he liked us.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.838
Tell me you used protection.

06:28.840 --> 06:32.508
You should be happy. We got laid.

06:32.510 --> 06:33.926
You got laid.

06:33.928 --> 06:36.145
I'm the one who has to
do the walk of shame.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.348
I'm sick of you messing with my life.

06:40.735 --> 06:43.903
Who's going to stop me, you?

06:43.905 --> 06:45.188
Please.

06:45.190 --> 06:47.073
No matter what that preacher tells you,

06:47.075 --> 06:49.325
I'm still the one in control here.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.911
We'll see about that.

07:21.776 --> 07:24.977
We got a problem.

07:35.373 --> 07:36.656
Got a permit to be playing out here?

07:36.658 --> 07:38.624
Officer Parsing.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.626
Just trying to make a couple extra bucks.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.961
Oh, kid.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.830
I know people in the music business.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.298
Maybe I can help get you a paying gig,

07:45.300 --> 07:46.916
make some real paper instead of coins.

07:46.918 --> 07:48.801
And what's in it for you?

07:48.803 --> 07:51.804
Cynicism is a prison mentality, my friend.

07:51.806 --> 07:54.557
Gotta learn to trust your fellow man.

07:54.559 --> 07:56.893
Buy you lunch.

08:00.265 --> 08:02.682
Why did you bring me back to my old home?

08:02.684 --> 08:05.184
Enos sent his people into my church...

08:05.186 --> 08:08.437
my house, where my daughter lives...

08:08.439 --> 08:11.607
So now we're going into his.

08:11.609 --> 08:14.694
Maybe we'll find something,
maybe it'll trigger a memory,

08:14.696 --> 08:16.412
something we can use against him.

08:16.414 --> 08:18.915
I'm telling you, there's nothing here.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.618
It's been abandoned for a reason.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.621
No one wants to live in the Devil's home.

08:25.623 --> 08:29.008
When was the last time you were here?

08:29.010 --> 08:32.211
I was ten years old
when we moved to Sangolo.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.631
I don't know if I can do this.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.467
You do want to get rid of Abigail, right?

08:39.470 --> 08:42.104
More than ever.

08:42.106 --> 08:45.358
Then I told you, this is the only way.

09:01.242 --> 09:03.042
You know, I looked up your sheet.

09:03.044 --> 09:06.879
You're an Abascal, which means
we're practically related.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.881
Yeah, your dad was in the Society of Sons

09:08.883 --> 09:12.084
around the same time
my dad was for a while.

09:12.086 --> 09:16.305
We're brothers.

09:16.307 --> 09:18.641
We're not brothers.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.393
My father was never part of anything

09:20.395 --> 09:22.929
that wasn't sick and cruel, so if that's

09:22.931 --> 09:24.730
what you're a part of,
I want nothing to do...

09:24.732 --> 09:27.984
Which is exactly why the
Sons parted ways with Enos

09:27.986 --> 09:31.354
a long time ago, divergent points of view.

09:31.356 --> 09:33.105
So what are you guys,

09:33.107 --> 09:36.659
some kind of Knights of Columbus?

09:36.661 --> 09:41.614
We're just good people,
doing good, praising God.

09:41.616 --> 09:46.035
I got a lot of other things to worry about.

09:46.037 --> 09:51.040
Yeah, let me take a guess. Money?

09:51.042 --> 09:53.459
And drugs?

09:53.461 --> 09:55.628
Am I right?

09:55.630 --> 09:57.630
I'm trying to go clean, but my dealer's

09:57.632 --> 10:00.683
hurting me on a heavy vig.

10:03.137 --> 10:06.973
Played Carnegie Hall and I still
couldn't get out from under him.

10:10.478 --> 10:13.529
Where does he live?

10:16.818 --> 10:18.651
It's my problem.

10:18.653 --> 10:22.288
Sons take care of their own.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.526
You want what's up in there?

11:00.528 --> 11:03.913
You will always be my
little girl, no matter what.

11:07.952 --> 11:11.037
What the hell are you doing?

11:11.039 --> 11:13.289
Sorry.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.374
Somebody's paying the electric bill.

13:27.225 --> 13:33.179
It's okay, sweetheart. Mommy's okay.

13:33.181 --> 13:38.651
Mommy's okay. Mommy's okay.

13:38.653 --> 13:41.937
Mommy's okay.

13:41.939 --> 13:44.440
Mommy's...

13:44.442 --> 13:45.991
Mommy's okay.

13:47.495 --> 13:48.861
Get out of this house!

13:57.788 --> 14:00.873
Take it, Maria.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.233
You okay?

14:27.235 --> 14:30.703
I'm never coming back here.

14:38.071 --> 14:40.155
I brought you something
for your collection,

14:40.157 --> 14:41.740
another tooth.

14:41.742 --> 14:44.409
One of your highly
educated crackers slip up?

14:44.411 --> 14:47.913
And Sweetmouth exacted
some necessary punishment.

14:47.915 --> 14:52.250
Oh, baby. Mmm, I love that.

14:52.252 --> 14:54.920
And look, this tooth's got gold in it.

14:54.922 --> 14:58.390
Well, look who it is.
Yo, your sister was here

14:58.392 --> 15:01.176
last night looking like some prime cut.

15:01.178 --> 15:04.429
Make a deal... break off a piece
of that ass for me and my girl

15:04.431 --> 15:06.598
and I'll scrap some change off your debt.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.400
Oh, I'm not here to make deals.

15:12.606 --> 15:15.524
Huh, looks like I'm getting another tooth.

15:15.526 --> 15:19.411
Who the hell are you
supposed to be, his sponsor?

15:19.413 --> 15:21.279
Him.

15:23.951 --> 15:26.585
David, you ever seen the body of a snitch?

15:26.587 --> 15:28.119
You more than dead.

15:28.121 --> 15:30.205
Now it looks like a
whole mouthful of teeth.

15:30.207 --> 15:32.007
I swear, I didn't.

15:34.878 --> 15:39.264
You and I need to talk, privately.

15:45.272 --> 15:46.721
Well, do you think that I could get

15:46.723 --> 15:48.974
your sister's phone number?

16:00.487 --> 16:03.121
Okay.

16:03.123 --> 16:07.409
Everything's all straight.

16:07.411 --> 16:08.994
We good.

16:08.996 --> 16:13.298
That's what I like to hear.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.500
You good?

16:15.502 --> 16:17.969
Let's go.

16:31.652 --> 16:35.320
David?

16:35.322 --> 16:38.356
You home?

16:51.672 --> 16:53.538
What do you think you're do...

17:02.382 --> 17:03.848
Get off of me!

17:03.850 --> 17:05.300
What's going on?

17:05.301 --> 17:06.885
I caught him looking through your window.

17:06.887 --> 17:09.387
Tell this guy to get
his hands off me, Maria.

17:09.388 --> 17:11.890
How do you know my name?

17:11.892 --> 17:17.145
It's me, Trevor... from Cadillac Blacks.

17:17.146 --> 17:18.396
You know him?

17:18.397 --> 17:20.315
Yeah, I've seen him around.

17:20.317 --> 17:24.202
What are you talking about?
We see each other all the time.

17:24.204 --> 17:26.738
We made out last night at the Cadillac.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.790
Just let me talk to her.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.494
- Look, Trevin...
- Trevor.

17:32.496 --> 17:34.829
Trevor, I'm sure you're a nice guy,

17:34.831 --> 17:39.417
but I really wasn't myself last night.

17:39.419 --> 17:42.754
I get it. It's typical.

17:42.756 --> 17:44.089
Hey, take it easy.

17:44.091 --> 17:46.591
Screw you, and screw you too.

17:46.593 --> 17:49.644
Hey, you watch how you talk to the lady.

18:01.608 --> 18:06.444
It's okay. No need to explain.

18:06.446 --> 18:08.947
Dusty, wait!

18:08.949 --> 18:11.533
Damn it.

18:17.290 --> 18:20.759
David, I want you to meet my favorite gal.

18:20.761 --> 18:23.428
This is my mother, Lanie Parsing.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.263
You know, David's folks
were in the Sons too.

18:25.265 --> 18:27.215
Isn't that something?

18:27.217 --> 18:29.467
That's not really true.

18:29.469 --> 18:32.554
It's a small, small world.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.310
I think I should get going.

to the new reverend who's come to town.

19:14.347 --> 19:15.680
Bledsoe?

19:15.682 --> 19:17.315
You're a friend of his, aren't ya?

19:17.317 --> 19:19.851
I wouldn't say we're friends.

19:22.856 --> 19:26.691
You hear that, Mother?

19:26.693 --> 19:29.661
He want to hear how we
know the good Reverend.

19:29.663 --> 19:32.363
Well, tell him, Dean.

19:34.334 --> 19:38.169
Son of a bitch killed my father.

19:38.171 --> 19:40.455
That's how.

19:40.457 --> 19:43.708
That's how, David.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.044
I found this by your father's incinerator.

19:46.046 --> 19:48.546
I didn't want to tell you
until I was certain what it was,

19:48.548 --> 19:51.633
but I remember seeing this
crest somewhere before.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.891
Society of Sons.

19:59.893 --> 20:02.477
What's their connection
to Order of Everlasting?

20:07.067 --> 20:08.566
It's the same symbol.

20:08.568 --> 20:11.486
Enos just added the Evil Eye.

20:11.488 --> 20:15.707
Society of Sons was founded
just after the Civil War,

20:15.709 --> 20:18.376
a fraternal order of
theologians and scholars

20:18.378 --> 20:20.161
devoted to harnessing the occult,

20:20.163 --> 20:21.746
but over the generations

20:21.748 --> 20:23.548
their curiosity hardened into fear

20:23.550 --> 20:25.550
and their bloodlines became inbred,

20:25.552 --> 20:29.420
degraded into violence and bigotry.

20:29.422 --> 20:33.091
Enos was a lot of things,
but he was no racist.

20:33.093 --> 20:35.426
He had all kinds of people
up there at Everlasting.

20:35.428 --> 20:37.228
Then that's why Enos splintered off

20:37.230 --> 20:38.680
to form his own sect.

20:38.682 --> 20:39.931
And how is it you're so familiar

20:39.933 --> 20:41.266
with these good ol' boys?

20:44.104 --> 20:45.937
If you're going to drag
me around Charleston

20:45.939 --> 20:49.741
digging up my past, then
I need the same from you.

20:49.743 --> 20:51.192
It's not that simple.

20:51.194 --> 20:53.912
Usually isn't, but you've been hiding

20:53.914 --> 20:55.029
a lot more than you've been sharing

20:55.031 --> 20:56.781
ever since you showed up.

20:56.783 --> 20:58.616
If we're going to pretend
we're on the same team,

20:58.618 --> 21:00.285
then I need you to start playing the part.

21:00.287 --> 21:01.452
What aren't you telling me?

21:01.454 --> 21:02.787
It doesn't matter now.

21:04.791 --> 21:07.876
Then call me when it does.

21:31.150 --> 21:35.319
Ooh, looks like your new
boyfriend Trevor left us a gift.

21:35.321 --> 21:36.654
Yeah, well, you're dancin' on tables,

21:36.656 --> 21:37.822
and now I'm the town whore.

21:37.824 --> 21:40.124
Oh, always the Devil's fault.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.459
Look in the mirror, honey.

21:41.461 --> 21:43.577
You people are just as bad as demons.

21:43.579 --> 21:45.996
Blame human nature, not me.

21:45.998 --> 21:47.665
But I'll take care of it.
Next time he gets close,

21:47.667 --> 21:49.416
I'll rip his heart out.

21:49.418 --> 21:52.253
No, we're not doing
that. He's not possessed.

21:52.255 --> 21:53.971
Trevor's a creep, but I'm not letting you

21:53.973 --> 21:55.339
put me through another Memphis.

21:55.341 --> 21:56.640
Stay out of it.

21:56.642 --> 21:58.509
I wasn't asking for your permission.

21:58.511 --> 22:00.311
I see that prick again, he's a corpse,

22:00.313 --> 22:04.014
and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

22:04.016 --> 22:05.816
I know, Lord, I know,

22:05.818 --> 22:08.769
but this is the only way to do your work.

22:08.771 --> 22:10.988
The bigger picture,
that's all that matters.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.607
It's not the lies we tell others.

22:13.609 --> 22:17.745
It's the lies we tell
ourselves that consume us.

22:19.031 --> 22:20.998
Oh! Oh!

22:44.974 --> 22:47.858
The Society of Sons was nothing more

22:47.860 --> 22:50.227
than a demented group
of backwoods clansmen...

22:51.647 --> 22:53.230
But as I made my way back home,

22:53.232 --> 22:55.816
Dean's words kept echoing in my head.

22:55.818 --> 22:57.234
What did we really know

22:57.236 --> 22:59.036
about this new man in our lives?

22:59.038 --> 23:00.037
Where's Maria?

23:00.039 --> 23:01.038
She's out.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.740
Who was Bledsoe?

23:02.742 --> 23:06.577
There's trouble at the church.

23:08.331 --> 23:10.164
Need Gracie to stay here for a bit.

23:10.166 --> 23:14.552
Sure. Of course.

23:14.554 --> 23:16.420
Maria told me she can depend on you.

23:16.422 --> 23:18.923
Make sure I don't regret it.

23:22.895 --> 23:25.930
Be sure to text me, okay?

23:28.184 --> 23:31.685
Don't worry. I'll keep her safe.

23:33.105 --> 23:36.156
Thank you.

23:48.788 --> 23:51.705
It's not much, but...

23:51.707 --> 23:54.091
beats sleeping in a truck.

23:54.093 --> 23:57.211
I like it.

23:57.213 --> 24:02.049
It's been a long time since
I saw you at the Everlasting.

24:02.051 --> 24:04.301
I remember.

24:04.303 --> 24:06.303
You used to sit outside with me at night,

24:06.305 --> 24:07.888
taught me the constellations.

24:09.775 --> 24:12.142
Yeah, I made that all up.

24:12.144 --> 24:16.113
There's no such thing as Bubba Minor.

24:16.115 --> 24:18.315
I know.

24:19.986 --> 24:24.455
Uh, you ran away from your dad, didn't you?

24:24.457 --> 24:26.907
That's how you ended up at
the Order of the Everlasting.

24:26.909 --> 24:28.626
How come?

24:28.628 --> 24:32.663
He drank a lot and we fought.
Wasn't a very nice time.

24:32.665 --> 24:34.081
Is that all?

24:34.083 --> 24:35.582
What do you mean?

24:35.584 --> 24:39.920
Nothing, but after you
escaped from the fire...

24:39.922 --> 24:42.423
I couldn't believe people
would do that to each other.

24:45.311 --> 24:48.145
I needed to find some peace.

24:48.147 --> 24:50.097
You mean the convent.

24:50.099 --> 24:51.849
It was the sisters who found me.

24:51.851 --> 24:54.768
They said God told them.

24:58.524 --> 24:59.857
Are you hungry?

24:59.859 --> 25:02.609
That's okay.

25:02.611 --> 25:06.163
Sit.

25:06.165 --> 25:09.199
I'll make something for you.

25:29.388 --> 25:32.773
Well, if it isn't Sister Abascal.

25:35.311 --> 25:37.644
What he do this time?

25:37.646 --> 25:41.148
This isn't about David. I have a problem.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.983
Usually we take confessions inside.

25:42.985 --> 25:46.070
It's not me. I'm being stalked.

25:46.072 --> 25:47.571
Oh, is that so?

25:47.573 --> 25:49.573
Well, kind of people you hang around

25:49.575 --> 25:51.709
aren't exactly what I'd call pious.

25:51.711 --> 25:53.911
I need you to arrest him.

25:53.913 --> 25:56.213
At least put a restraining order on him

25:56.215 --> 25:57.748
before somebody gets hurt.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.550
So did this man threaten you?

25:59.552 --> 26:01.668
That's not what I'm worried about exactly.

26:01.670 --> 26:03.420
All right, let's go back for a second.

26:03.422 --> 26:04.755
Who is he?

26:04.757 --> 26:06.757
This guy that works at Cadillac Blacks.

26:06.759 --> 26:08.509
His name's Trevor.

26:08.511 --> 26:10.394
And you have a relationship
with this gentleman?

26:10.396 --> 26:14.098
No, I don't.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.684
I may have kissed him
once when I wasn't myself.

26:17.686 --> 26:21.355
You made out with him.
You put it out there.

26:21.357 --> 26:24.108
What does that have to do with anything?

26:24.110 --> 26:26.610
I didn't ask for this!

26:26.612 --> 26:27.778
What am I supposed to do,

26:27.780 --> 26:29.613
just wait until somebody gets killed?

26:29.615 --> 26:33.700
I don't write the laws, I just enforce 'em.

26:33.702 --> 26:37.788
Give me something I can
work with, I'll help you out.

26:44.797 --> 26:46.930
The Pacekos called.

26:46.932 --> 26:49.716
They're moving back to First Baptist.

26:49.718 --> 26:52.770
They're the third family to leave.

26:52.772 --> 26:54.721
People are scared.

26:54.723 --> 26:56.607
There's a lot of hate in the world.

26:56.609 --> 26:59.059
This is more than that, this is personal.

26:59.061 --> 27:01.278
It doesn't matter, it's in the past.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.313
I'm a different man now.

27:03.315 --> 27:06.483
Trust me, the past doesn't
care who you think you are now.

27:06.485 --> 27:08.452
Think about Grace.

27:08.454 --> 27:10.871
What about Grace?

27:15.127 --> 27:16.960
You have to take her away from here.

27:16.962 --> 27:18.662
- No.
- Damn it, just listen

27:18.664 --> 27:20.164
to what I'm telling you.

27:20.166 --> 27:22.466
I had a daughter too
once, and when I lost her,

27:22.468 --> 27:25.169
I swore I'd do anything to stop the pain.

27:25.171 --> 27:27.504
Please, Reverend.

27:27.506 --> 27:31.258
You don't ever want to have
to do the things I swore.

27:31.260 --> 27:33.760
She's rare and she needs to be protected.

27:33.762 --> 27:36.597
I know how to protect
her from these animals.

27:36.599 --> 27:38.015
I'm not just talking about the Sons,

27:38.017 --> 27:41.602
I'm talking about him.

27:41.604 --> 27:45.105
I was one of his first
followers back on Sangolo,

27:45.107 --> 27:48.025
and for the last 20
years, I've tried to atone,

27:48.027 --> 27:49.526
but I can never wash myself clean

27:49.528 --> 27:52.279
of the the evil things I did there.

27:52.281 --> 27:56.200
Maybe you can't, but I
have faith in the Lord.

27:59.205 --> 28:03.457
Which one, Elijah?

28:03.459 --> 28:05.876
Which one?

28:17.309 --> 28:19.643
I need you to get a message to Trevor.

28:22.448 --> 28:24.481
Your brother thinks he can come in here

28:24.483 --> 28:28.652
and threaten my man, take
the food out of my mouth?

28:28.654 --> 28:30.070
What are you talkin' about?

28:30.072 --> 28:32.789
Sweetmouth got muscled
out of his own territory

28:32.791 --> 28:36.159
by your traitorous brother and the Sons.

28:36.161 --> 28:37.961
Society of Sons?

28:37.963 --> 28:39.629
Why the hell do you
think I'm working the bar?

28:39.631 --> 28:43.500
Had to cut costs, fired
that four-eyed candy-ass.

28:48.474 --> 28:51.174
Stay the hell outta here!

28:55.814 --> 28:59.015
The past has ways of catching up with us.

28:59.017 --> 29:03.353
Sometimes it brings pain, sometimes anger,

29:03.355 --> 29:05.605
but every once in a while,

29:05.607 --> 29:08.658
sometimes the past brings us beauty.

29:08.660 --> 29:10.193
It's a swamp.

29:10.195 --> 29:12.195
It's really nice.

29:12.197 --> 29:15.198
Hey, pretty lady.

29:16.702 --> 29:20.370
Isn't Tetra expecting you at Frogmores?

29:20.372 --> 29:23.457
Go.

29:24.843 --> 29:26.710
That is a nice piece o' ass.

29:26.712 --> 29:28.712
Not like that.

29:28.714 --> 29:31.348
You like her.

29:31.350 --> 29:33.467
You know that's the Rev's daughter.

29:33.469 --> 29:35.519
Just tragic if something happened to her.

29:35.521 --> 29:39.055
What do you want?

29:39.057 --> 29:42.976
I'm calling in the marker.

29:42.978 --> 29:45.061
I took care of you,

29:45.063 --> 29:48.565
now you're gonna take
care of the black preacher.

29:48.567 --> 29:52.068
Are you crazy? I'm not a killer.

29:52.070 --> 29:53.403
Not yet.

29:53.405 --> 29:54.571
Go to hell.

29:54.573 --> 29:56.873
Come on out, Clive.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.910
Feelin' all right, Davey?
You look a little shaken.

29:59.912 --> 30:02.579
I'm sure it's nothing a
little mother's milk won't fix.

30:13.091 --> 30:15.759
Society of Sons.

30:15.761 --> 30:19.262
We'll do for you when you do for us.

30:19.264 --> 30:21.231
What did you just give me?

30:21.233 --> 30:23.233
You like what we pumped in your veins?

30:23.235 --> 30:25.068
There's plenty more where that came from.

30:25.070 --> 30:28.238
It's our Mother Lanie's
very own special blend.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.906
Didn't your girlfriend Charlotte tell you

30:29.908 --> 30:32.108
there's a new candy man in
town? And we run the show now.

30:32.110 --> 30:33.443
Charlotte set me up?

30:33.445 --> 30:35.195
It's not Charlotte's fault.

30:35.197 --> 30:37.280
See, mother's milk is
more than just a high.

30:37.282 --> 30:40.200
It's a whole new way of seeing
things, the way they really are.

30:40.202 --> 30:44.254
A curtain of darkness fell over my world.

30:44.256 --> 30:48.091
I could hear all my fears
whispering inside my head,

30:48.093 --> 30:52.429
turning me against myself,
corrupting my thoughts.

30:52.431 --> 30:56.967
Now, you gotta consider
the greater evil here.

30:56.969 --> 31:01.972
So good, Bledsoe is not a man of God.

31:01.974 --> 31:05.442
He's a killer, a murderer, and he's got

31:05.444 --> 31:07.727
his dirty little claws
in you and your sister.

31:07.729 --> 31:09.813
He's playing you two like a six-string.

31:09.815 --> 31:12.065
Maria.

31:12.067 --> 31:15.819
Now, Mother... Mother and me, we pray,

31:15.821 --> 31:19.623
and we pray for a way to
make him pay for what he did,

31:19.625 --> 31:23.827
and you... you are the
answer to our prayers.

31:23.829 --> 31:26.129
This was different than any drug,

31:26.131 --> 31:28.331
different than any possession.

31:28.333 --> 31:31.301
I was being infected by madness.

31:31.303 --> 31:35.589
Bledsoe is Enos.

31:37.342 --> 31:39.426
Now I think he's finally
starting to see the truth.

31:52.324 --> 31:54.608
Hey, Rome.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.610
The hell do you want?

31:56.612 --> 31:58.445
I need you to get back in your car

31:58.447 --> 32:00.030
and drive it straight out of town.

32:00.032 --> 32:04.034
But you and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

32:04.036 --> 32:06.369
You have no idea who I am.

32:08.874 --> 32:10.540
Okay.

32:10.542 --> 32:11.875
Come on, get up. You'll be all right.

32:11.877 --> 32:14.711
Get off me.

32:14.713 --> 32:17.797
It's time for you to go.

32:28.727 --> 32:30.360
Tetra, are you her?

32:30.362 --> 32:32.162
I'm here, Gracie.

32:32.164 --> 32:33.663
What is all this?

32:33.665 --> 32:35.365
Drink the tea and be calm.

32:35.367 --> 32:38.501
Trust me, this will all make sense soon.

32:38.503 --> 32:40.153
I tried to warn him, Grace.

32:40.155 --> 32:42.372
I told your father to
take you away from here

32:42.374 --> 32:43.940
before it was too late.

32:46.945 --> 32:49.346
Those are his words. Enos.

32:49.348 --> 32:52.282
Yes, but sometimes, in the right hands,

32:52.284 --> 32:55.952
even evil can be used for good.

33:12.270 --> 33:16.856
My soul may already be damned,
but by all that is unholy,

33:16.858 --> 33:21.661
I swear I will do everything
I can to protect you guys.

33:33.625 --> 33:36.676
Dusty?

33:59.651 --> 34:02.152
What the hell are you doing?

34:02.154 --> 34:05.488
Please, sit.

34:05.490 --> 34:08.742
I... I want to tell you something.

34:13.646 --> 34:15.813
Trevor, just put the gun down

34:15.815 --> 34:18.884
and we can talk about
whatever you want, okay?

34:21.789 --> 34:25.072
Look at you.

34:25.074 --> 34:27.826
I see you differently than everyone else.

34:27.828 --> 34:33.498
I see the way you are, the way you move.

34:33.501 --> 34:35.250
I know you now.

34:35.252 --> 34:38.587
I've taken your invitation seriously.

34:38.589 --> 34:40.839
What invitation?

34:40.841 --> 34:43.342
Wh... the kiss, th...

34:43.344 --> 34:47.596
The way you show yourself to me.

34:47.598 --> 34:51.016
You like the flowers?

34:51.018 --> 34:53.185
They're very nice.

34:53.187 --> 34:54.820
I've seen you at the market.

34:54.822 --> 34:57.022
I know how you stare at 'em, wantin' 'em,

34:57.024 --> 34:58.524
and you never buy 'em for yourself,

34:58.526 --> 35:00.993
but I can buy 'em for you.

35:00.995 --> 35:04.446
I know what foods you like.

35:04.448 --> 35:09.117
I know what panties you wear.

35:09.119 --> 35:12.037
I know how your face changes
when you touch yourself.

35:12.039 --> 35:15.841
After you left, I went into your bedroom

35:15.843 --> 35:19.127
and I smelled you...

35:19.129 --> 35:22.214
and then my face changed too.

35:22.216 --> 35:25.634
You need to get outta here,
Trevor, before it's too late.

35:28.856 --> 35:31.974
We need to get rid of the
men in your life, Maria.

35:31.976 --> 35:34.059
There's too many.

35:34.061 --> 35:35.894
You only need me.

35:35.896 --> 35:40.566
I mean, th... there's
your brother and Reverend

35:40.568 --> 35:43.368
and Dusty, but he won't bother you anymore.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.070
What did you do to him?

35:45.072 --> 35:46.538
I did what you needed me to do.

35:50.744 --> 35:52.411
Don't answer it.

35:56.250 --> 35:59.334
Ah!

36:00.421 --> 36:02.054
Maria?

36:03.591 --> 36:04.590
What the hell?

36:11.398 --> 36:12.764
What are you?

36:15.236 --> 36:17.769
Abigail, no! You can't kill him!

36:17.771 --> 36:20.188
Yes!

36:21.358 --> 36:22.407
I said no!

36:23.744 --> 36:25.244
Ah!

36:34.288 --> 36:35.420
You crazy bi...

36:54.441 --> 36:57.476
Maria? I'm in trouble.

36:57.478 --> 37:00.312
It's about Bledsoe.
You've got to call me back.

37:14.995 --> 37:18.130
He could've killed us both.

37:18.132 --> 37:19.247
We should call the police.

37:19.249 --> 37:22.334
No. Can't.

37:24.838 --> 37:27.639
I did a little time and
I'm still on probation.

37:27.641 --> 37:30.842
For what?

37:30.844 --> 37:34.096
After Afghanistan...

37:34.098 --> 37:36.598
Doesn't matter.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.767
It's on me, all right? I'll
take the hit, don't worry.

37:38.769 --> 37:41.269
No, no, it's my fault
you got caught up in this.

37:41.271 --> 37:42.521
Forget it!

37:42.523 --> 37:44.489
Listen to me. Nothing about this

37:44.491 --> 37:48.276
was your fault, okay? That's it.

37:53.951 --> 37:56.451
Look...

37:56.453 --> 37:58.203
I already spoke to Sheriff Dickey.

37:58.205 --> 38:00.005
Son of a bitch has been
gunning for me and my brother

38:00.007 --> 38:02.507
since we moved back
here. He won't believe us.

38:02.509 --> 38:05.627
I told you, it's on me.

38:05.629 --> 38:07.379
We have to get rid of the body.

38:07.381 --> 38:10.882
I know where there's a furnace.

38:31.238 --> 38:33.989
I don't ever want to talk about this again.

38:33.991 --> 38:37.793
Trust me, it's in the past.

38:47.554 --> 38:49.087
Bledsoe, he's got

38:49.089 --> 38:50.922
his dirty little claws
in you and your sister.

38:50.924 --> 38:52.591
- He's a killer.
- Playing you two.

38:52.593 --> 38:57.596
Bledsoe is Enos.

38:57.598 --> 38:59.431
Who are you really?

38:59.433 --> 39:02.601
- David?
- Get down!

39:02.603 --> 39:05.604
Just get down!

39:05.606 --> 39:07.272
Don't do this, David.

39:07.274 --> 39:09.608
Where is Grace? If you hurt her...

39:09.610 --> 39:14.196
I would never hurt her,
but maybe you would.

39:14.198 --> 39:18.250
Is it true that you killed a man?

39:18.252 --> 39:20.368
I had no choice.

39:20.370 --> 39:24.122
You're saying it was self defense?

39:24.124 --> 39:26.792
I'm saying it was complicated.

39:26.794 --> 39:30.929
Who are you really?

39:30.931 --> 39:33.465
You just came here out of nowhere

39:33.467 --> 39:37.552
and all this trouble came with you!

39:37.554 --> 39:43.642
My sister told me Enos can be anyone.

39:43.644 --> 39:45.310
Maybe you're him.

39:45.312 --> 39:47.395
No.

39:47.397 --> 39:51.650
David, Enos is the one trying to trick you

39:51.652 --> 39:56.154
into pulling that trigger
to damn your own soul.

39:56.156 --> 39:59.658
If someone wants me dead so badly,

39:59.660 --> 40:02.828
why doesn't he do it himself?

40:02.830 --> 40:04.496
Give me the gun.

40:09.636 --> 40:11.920
David. David, don't do it.

40:11.922 --> 40:15.474
Why not! There's something bad inside me.

40:15.476 --> 40:17.092
David, please.

40:17.094 --> 40:19.311
I don't think I can control it much longer,

40:19.313 --> 40:22.647
and I don't have any other way to stop it!

40:22.649 --> 40:25.350
You have me.

40:26.687 --> 40:28.770
You always have me.

40:28.772 --> 40:31.106
I know how hard it is sometimes.

40:31.108 --> 40:34.109
David.

40:40.284 --> 40:43.368
It's okay.

40:56.850 --> 41:01.720
From now on, no more lies,
or I'll take you out myself.

41:04.641 --> 41:08.393
It's easy to let emotions blind us,

41:08.395 --> 41:12.480
to let fear lead us into darkness.

41:14.818 --> 41:18.870
Sometimes we need someone
to open our eyes again

41:18.872 --> 41:21.239
and help us see the light.
