WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:03.262
Previously on Elementary...
Andrew, are you okay?

00:03.300 --> 00:04.767
(choking)
(gasps)

00:04.800 --> 00:07.098
Oh, my God.
Somebody call an ambulance!

00:07.140 --> 00:09.062
(under breath):
One, two, three...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.668
I feel clear
about something.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.634
It's ridiculous for me to think
that I can have a normal life.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.739
I'm a detective.
I'm ready to embrace that.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.271
I want to come back
to the brownstone.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.781
(man speaking French)

00:32.200 --> 00:34.191
(speaking French)

00:34.230 --> 00:35.458
Ah, Watson.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.468
May I present Luc?
Luc, Watson.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.764
What are
you doing here?

00:39.800 --> 00:42.030
Luc has agreed
to handle your move.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.504
I helped his relatives emigrate

00:44.540 --> 00:45.768
from Guadeloupe many years ago,

00:45.810 --> 00:47.129
and in return, he assists me

00:47.180 --> 00:49.148
with matters which require
physical labor.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.374
Well, it's bad enough
you broke in here,

00:50.410 --> 00:51.638
but breaking in and
taking my things

00:51.680 --> 00:52.669
could be construed
as burglary.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.142
I did not break in.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.545
I have chastised
you repeatedly

00:55.580 --> 00:56.842
about that lock's
inadequacy.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.313
Not changing it was the
same as giving me a key.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.385
I appreciate that, but I've
already hired real movers

01:01.420 --> 01:03.559
to come and take my
things in the morning.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.729
No offense,
Luc.
Luc speaks not one
word of English.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.398
In fact,
he barely speaks at all.

01:07.430 --> 01:08.829
It is but one
of his many virtues.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.299
And a real moving company

01:11.330 --> 01:12.558
will set foot in the brownstone

01:12.600 --> 01:13.862
over my moldering corpse.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.538
It is our sanctum
and our stronghold,

01:15.570 --> 01:18.300
and I trust no one but Luc
within its confines.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.103
(speaking French)

01:20.140 --> 01:22.745
Uh, those are things that are
not going to the brownstone.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.578
Where else would they be going?
Well, I'm moving into
a furnished place,

01:25.610 --> 01:26.816
so I'm just gonna take
what I need from my room

01:26.850 --> 01:27.874
and the rest can be donated.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.478
Are you sure you wouldn't rather

01:29.520 --> 01:30.782
just keep them in storage?

01:30.820 --> 01:32.788
We have plenty of room
in our basement.

01:32.820 --> 01:34.788
You are the one that said

01:34.820 --> 01:36.583
that all of this_
was me attempting

01:36.630 --> 01:38.222
to have a life
that wasn't me.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.796
You were right,
so I am done here.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.424
And I'm done with
all of these things.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.860
It's a beautiful piece.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.299
They all are.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.898
Thanks.

01:50.940 --> 01:54.239
I take it you are
the original owner of all this?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.406
Iam.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.408
Do you have the receipts?

01:57.450 --> 02:00.613
Well, they were gifts

02:00.650 --> 02:03.517
from my husband, so... no.

02:05.850 --> 02:06.885
I'm sorry.

02:08.890 --> 02:11.723
I'll, uh, I'll add it up
and write you a check.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.457
Actually, it-it has to be cash.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.406
WOMAN:
Henry...

02:28.880 --> 02:31.849
Remember me?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.814
I've brought you some
clothes a few times.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.739
Roast beef sandwich,

02:36.790 --> 02:37.848
chicken soup...

02:58.940 --> 03:00.931
(muffled gunshot)

04:01.070 --> 04:03.607
Victim's name
is Henry Wilseck.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.039
Had a Pennsylvania
driver's license on him

04:05.070 --> 04:06.970
that expired
seven years ago.

04:07.010 --> 04:09.899
He also had some
psychological problems,

04:09.950 --> 04:10.974
at least according to

04:11.010 --> 04:12.671
the canvassing
we did.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.972
He'd been sleeping
in the park for months.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.419
WATSON :
Any family?

04:16.450 --> 04:19.010
Still following the info
on the license,

04:19.050 --> 04:23.419
but looks like he fell through
the cracks a long time ago.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.397
Did anyone remove
anything from the body?

04:27.430 --> 04:28.829
Because the bloodstain
on the Inner lining

04:28.860 --> 04:30.396
cuts off right here.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.694
Yeah, M.L.I. found this
tucked inside his coat.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.368
It's filled
with cash.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.006
$3,814.62
exactly.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.372
Uh, there was
this, too.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.075
"Rich people are worth
more than poor people.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.839
Life's not fair.
Grow up."

04:46.880 --> 04:49.019
Captain,
with your permission,

04:49.050 --> 04:50.915
I'll send this
to Harlan Emple.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.611
See if he can
identify the maths.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.788
BELL:
Well, it gets weirder.

04:55.820 --> 04:58.050
Position our guys
found the envelope in,

04:58.090 --> 05:00.456
bullet would've went
right through it.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.956
So somebody placed
it on the body

05:02.000 --> 05:03.319
after he was shot.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.769
WATSON: So someone
kills a homeless man

05:04.800 --> 05:06.631
in the middle of the
financial district,

05:06.670 --> 05:09.366
leaves about $4,000
and a note saying

05:09.410 --> 05:11.332
how little poor
people are worth.

05:11.370 --> 05:13.031
If this is some sort of
political statement,

05:13.080 --> 05:14.104
I don't get it.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.472
HOLMES:
The socioeconomic outrage

05:16.510 --> 05:19.377
does bear the whiff
of theater, does it not?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.877
If you're genuinely angry
about wealth inequality,

05:21.920 --> 05:24.514
you don't tend to go around
shooting homeless people.

05:24.550 --> 05:26.381
(phone chimes)

05:26.420 --> 05:28.786
Harlan recognizes the formula.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.526
He says it's used in civil law

05:30.560 --> 05:33.120
_ _ to calculate _
Victim compensation.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.957
Both it and the quote

05:35.000 --> 05:36.490
are the brainchildren
of the same man,

05:36.530 --> 05:37.997
an attorney
by the name of

05:38.030 --> 05:40.396
Arlen Schrader.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.135
He said this?
In public?

05:42.170 --> 05:43.808
In print.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.034
Well, if he's the shooter,

05:45.070 --> 05:46.628
he basically signed his work.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.908
This formula has made
Mr. Schrader

05:47.940 --> 05:49.805
a wealthy man many times over,

05:49.850 --> 05:51.374
so I doubt he'd want to draw
this kind of attention to it.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.638
GREGSON:
Well, whoever did it

05:52.680 --> 05:54.147
wants us to connect this body

05:54.180 --> 05:55.647
to that lawyer.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.080
Go talk to him and find out why.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.121
Specializing
in dispute resolution

06:06.160 --> 06:07.957
and wrongful
death compensation.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.820
Only the latest
in a long line

06:09.870 --> 06:12.088
of euphemisms
for "blood money."

06:12.130 --> 06:13.893
You know about this stuff?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.168
Whenever a corporation
cuts corners

06:15.200 --> 06:16.462
on a child's car seat

06:16.510 --> 06:18.501
or allows poison
to penetrate our food

06:18.540 --> 06:20.576
or rolls the dice
on an Oil rIg safety valve,

06:20.610 --> 06:21.975
someone like Mr. Schrader

06:22.010 --> 06:23.841
calculates the minimum
amount of money

06:23.880 --> 06:26.075
they can pay the victims' loved
ones to keep them from suing.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.475
Or, heaven forbid,

06:27.520 --> 06:29.078
from clamoring for
criminal prosecution.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.111
Maybe that's what the money
in the envelope is about.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.959
That's what Schrader's formula

06:32.990 --> 06:34.514
would have determined
each victim was worth?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.983
So the killer set a price
and then paid it.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.452
Bought the guy's life.

06:38.490 --> 06:39.627
Just to make Schrader look bad?

06:39.660 --> 06:41.457
HOLMES:
An understandable,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.127
if misapplied,
instinct.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.922
Schrader makes his
living by reducing

06:44.970 --> 06:46.790
the value of a person
to a dollar amount.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.831
As if a widow
can find solace

06:48.870 --> 06:50.633
in a husband-shaped
pile of money,

06:50.670 --> 06:52.979
or a check can raise
an orphaned Child.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.478
It's repugnant.
You wouldn't be the first

06:55.510 --> 06:56.704
to call me that.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.399
Arlen Schrader.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.514
You have some questions for me?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.781
SCHRADER:
That comment

07:04.820 --> 07:06.856
is constantly taken
out of context.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.723
We'd be eager to hear an example
of the right context.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.887
I didn't invent tort law, okay?

07:11.930 --> 07:14.854
We base compensation,
in part,

07:14.900 --> 07:16.720
on the lost future
earnings of the decedent.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.726
Then this murder might be
the right context.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.237
Our killer used your principles

07:20.270 --> 07:22.090
to determine
Henry Wilseck's worth

07:22.140 --> 07:24.608
and then left that amount
in exchange for his life.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.528
Fair swap, in your eyes?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.207
Anything wrong with that?
SCHRADER:
Of course there is.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.140
The person you're talking about
fired a gun,

07:30.180 --> 07:31.647
knowing it would
cause a man's death.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.568
It's murder;
they should be punished.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.508
By that measure,
many of your clients

07:35.550 --> 07:37.188
should be behind bars,
should they not?

07:37.220 --> 07:39.757
Perhaps if our killer
had incorporated first...

07:39.790 --> 07:41.087
WATSON:
Whoever shot Henry Wilseck

07:41.120 --> 07:42.257
wanted to make it about you.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.723
We want to know if you know

07:43.760 --> 07:45.079
anyone who would do that,
and why.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.757
You're asking
if anyone hates me?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.893
The line forms behind this guy.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.989
Well, anyone
in particular

07:51.030 --> 07:52.224
have reason
to cause you trouble?

07:52.270 --> 07:53.897
Aside from
our colleague?

07:53.940 --> 07:56.090
I was in a relationship.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.098
With another attorney.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.529
Her name is Erin Chatworth.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.268
It was short,
but it was serious.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.517
I broke it off and...

08:06.550 --> 08:07.869
she was very angry.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.047
I'll give you all
of her information.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.185
Ms. Chatworth,
it's obvious to me

08:14.220 --> 08:15.517
that you've recently stopped
wearing a wedding band.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.982
Was your marriage
a casualty

08:17.030 --> 08:18.827
of your affair
with Arlen Schrader?

08:18.860 --> 08:20.293
And if so,

08:20.330 --> 08:22.150
how angry were you

08:22.200 --> 08:24.862
when he recused himself
from your pants?

08:24.900 --> 08:26.561
You still haven't told me
what this is all about.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.739
Did somebody hurt Arlen?
BELL:
No.

08:28.770 --> 08:29.998
No, but it does
lookae

08:30.040 --> 08:31.302
someone might have
a grudge against him.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.898
Can you tell us
where you were last night,

08:32.940 --> 08:34.532
between 1:00
and 4:00 am?

08:34.580 --> 08:35.672
Home, sleeping.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.575
Where were you?

08:37.610 --> 08:39.100
Mr. Schrader said
that he broke things off

08:39.150 --> 08:40.572
because of a conflict
of interest,

08:40.620 --> 08:41.609
but he did not elaborate.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.584
N0, I-I...

08:43.620 --> 08:44.848
I bet he wouldn't.

08:44.890 --> 08:45.948
Would you?

08:47.790 --> 08:50.782
Do you remember
Aceway Flight 1059?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.058
Uh, yeah.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.591
A commuter flight

08:53.630 --> 08:55.222
from LaGuardia
to Burlington, Vermont

08:55.260 --> 08:57.569
that crashed last year.
80 people were killed.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.589
81, actually.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.131
NTSB blamed the airline,

09:00.170 --> 09:01.728
said it was due
to faulty maintenance.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.203
HOLMES:
And that was the

09:03.240 --> 09:05.333
client that he_chose
over your relationship?

09:05.370 --> 09:06.871
CHATWORTH:
Potential client.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.332
Arlen is one of the top

09:08.380 --> 09:09.870
victims' comp attorneys
in the country,

09:09.910 --> 09:12.003
so Aceway went to him first.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.574
They haven't signed
anything yet,

09:13.620 --> 09:14.644
but the billables
on that account

09:14.680 --> 09:15.908
would be in the millions.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.808
_ I do business _
With a competing airline.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.282
And that made you a liability.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.129
Arlen dumped me

09:23.160 --> 09:25.822
so he could profit
off 81 people's deaths.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.999
Do you really think
I'm losing much sleep

09:28.030 --> 09:29.622
because he's out of my life?

09:37.340 --> 09:38.898
BELL:
Schrader did bust up
her marriage

09:38.940 --> 09:40.601
and her alibi
IS weak,

09:40.640 --> 09:42.608
but we don't think
she's involved.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.901
What about the husband?

09:43.950 --> 09:45.247
She said he was
seeing someone, too.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.304
And there was a prenup in place

09:46.350 --> 09:47.749
that paid out to him,

09:47.780 --> 09:49.042
so he's actually pretty happy

09:49.080 --> 09:50.286
about the way things turned out.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.857
I'm gonna run him down
all the same.

09:52.890 --> 09:55.051
Well, whoever left that cash
on the victim,

09:55.090 --> 09:56.751
you were right
about it being a smear job.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.883
All the tabloids
got copies of this

09:58.930 --> 10:00.329
in the mail
this morning.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.328
"By now, I have killed
Henry Wilseck.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.169
"But I have paid the price.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.394
"Ask the police.
Ask Arlen Schrader.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.761
How much is any of us worth?"

10:06.800 --> 10:08.893
Postmarks were from
two days ago.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.168
We're checking
for prints, but...

10:10.210 --> 10:11.859
considering
the note

10:11.910 --> 10:13.639
that he left on
Wilseck was clean,

10:13.680 --> 10:14.829
I'm not holding
my breath.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.336
This'll get some headlines.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.938
Well, talk radio
is already on it.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.346
Schrader's taking as much heat
as the killer.

10:20.380 --> 10:23.110
If he doesn't take back
some of the stuff he said,

10:23.150 --> 10:26.119
his body might be
the next one we find.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.812
(crickets chirping)

10:45.340 --> 10:47.331
(groans)

10:50.780 --> 10:52.771
(loud banging)

10:59.090 --> 11:01.058
What's all this?

11:01.090 --> 11:02.978
You never come down here.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.952
I was just...

11:04.990 --> 11:06.821
uh, ruminating on the case.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.054
The noise wake you?

11:08.100 --> 11:09.965
No, actually it was

11:10.000 --> 11:11.422
too quiet.
I couldn't sleep.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.869
Is that why you're down here?

11:12.900 --> 11:15.198
You were worried
about the n0ise?

11:15.240 --> 11:17.367
Well, it did not
not cross my mind.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.072
Well, you know you don't have
to tiptoe around for me, right?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.372
I mean, I knew
what I was signing up for

11:21.410 --> 11:22.741
when I said I wanted
to come back.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.702
At my request,

11:24.750 --> 11:27.469
Arlen Schrader sent over every
piece of hate mail he's received

11:27.520 --> 11:29.476
from the last two years.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.148
and received a
smaller settlement

11:32.190 --> 11:33.179
from an offending company

11:33.220 --> 11:34.380
than they felt they deserved.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.253
Or who were denied
compensation altogether.

11:37.290 --> 11:38.928
I've been reviewing
them in the hope

11:38.960 --> 11:40.450
that a viable suspect
would emerge.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.197
But so far none has done me
the courtesy of leaping out.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.460
Maybe it's someone who hates
Schrader for another reason.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.036
I mean, considering the way

11:48.070 --> 11:49.435
he broke things off
with Erin Chatworth,

11:49.470 --> 11:50.459
I'm sure there are plenty.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.159
Or perhaps

11:54.810 --> 11:56.869
Ms. Chatworth mentioned
that the Aceway account

11:56.910 --> 11:59.378
would be worth millions
in attorney's fees.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.014
And that's just one client.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.348
So, perhaps, as I'm sure
Mr. Schrader would put it,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.346
it's just business.

12:05.390 --> 12:09.156
So, you think it's
one of his competitors.

12:09.190 --> 12:12.023
Another victims' comp attorney?

12:12.060 --> 12:13.459
It would be an effective way
of stealing the company

12:13.500 --> 12:15.456
away from Mr. Schrader--
don't you think?

12:17.470 --> 12:19.358
It's one possibility.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.369
There will be others.
You should sleep, Watson.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.335
Unlike me, you're
more effective with
it than without.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.305
We'll review everything
in the morning.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.171
I have to go to my apartment
tomorrow afternoon.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.802
I have to do
a final walk-through

12:31.850 --> 12:33.477
to get my security deposit back.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.818
Will that be going
to charity as well?

12:35.850 --> 12:37.215
Actually, I was thinking
it could go

12:37.250 --> 12:38.945
towards restocking the kitchen.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.480
All right.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.511
I'll see you in the morning.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.048
Matt was the entrepreneur
in the family.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.829
Made his first million at 25.

12:48.860 --> 12:52.227
It was, uh, phone apps
or something.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.488
He was always on my ass to do

12:54.540 --> 12:58.067
something with my crappy life.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.374
Yeah, I used to get
just so ticked at him.

13:00.410 --> 13:03.504
Just... said
he should support me

13:03.550 --> 13:06.303
no matter what I was doing,
you know?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.875
More than once,
I-I yelled at him

13:08.920 --> 13:11.980
to just... shut up, you know?

13:12.020 --> 13:15.251
But he just kept
coming to my gigs

13:15.290 --> 13:17.281
no matter what.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.991
(moaning)

13:37.580 --> 13:39.502
Whoa.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.074
I wasn't that good, was I?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.439
(laughs)

13:42.480 --> 13:44.914
I have some business
to take care of today.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.885
It's a cash transaction.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.525
Rich people.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.323
Hey, you haven't told anyone

13:53.360 --> 13:56.898
about this thing
we have, have you?

13:56.930 --> 13:58.420
No.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.291
Nobody knows you're slumming it.

14:02.470 --> 14:03.937
Since when do you smoke?

14:03.970 --> 14:05.938
Since I was ten.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.074
You know, I quit for a while
when Matt died.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.874
But guess it didn't stick.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.515
Is that a problem?

14:13.550 --> 14:14.869
No, of course not.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.911
It just changes the math.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.212
What math?

14:43.110 --> 14:44.099
BELL:
Frederic Duncan.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.549
His friends called him Freddy.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.138
He's 44 years old.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.148
He's a drummer in a band
no one's ever heard of.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.613
His girlfriend found him.

14:50.650 --> 14:54.086
Her coworkers alibied her
for the time of the murder.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.681
So, you said there
was another note?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.322
"Dear Michael Cardenas:

14:59.360 --> 15:00.691
"Just saved you more money.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.322
You're welcome."

15:02.360 --> 15:04.692
Cardenas is the CEO
of Aceway Airlines.

15:04.730 --> 15:08.234
The company responsible for
the downed flight to Vermont.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.135
The killer sent copies
of this to the press, too.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.501
So, just like
with the first victim,

15:11.540 --> 15:12.666
they know everything.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.974
So, is Mr. Duncan also

15:15.010 --> 15:16.170
bought and paid for?

15:16.210 --> 15:17.472
GREGSON:
Perp left

15:17.510 --> 15:19.375
just under 80 grand
at the scene.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.241
BELL:
That's a hell of
a lot more than last time.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.679
But considering Duncan
was only in his 405,

15:22.720 --> 15:24.347
I'd say the killer didn't think

15:24.390 --> 15:26.119
his music career
was about to take off.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.157
So, our culprit might
be a homicidal maniac,

15:30.190 --> 15:31.521
but you can't say
they're not putting

15:31.560 --> 15:32.959
their money where
their mouth is.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.729
Any idea what they meant

15:34.760 --> 15:36.591
when they said they're
saving the airline money?

15:36.630 --> 15:38.518
Turns out this vic
and the first both had

15:38.570 --> 15:40.697
family on Flight 1059.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.264
BELL:
Henry Wilseck lost an uncle.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.734
Freddy Duncan lost a brother.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.260
So, the killer's
targeting beneficiaries

15:46.310 --> 15:48.278
of those lost on the plane?

15:48.310 --> 15:50.278
Thanks to him, there's two
less people to pay out now.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.039
So, we're trying to locate
all the beneficiaries.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.672
But it's gonna take time.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.110
Meanwhile, 79 more people
could be in his sights.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.520
Place looks spotless.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.994
I don't even think
we'll have to repaint.

16:07.030 --> 16:10.124
Well, I guess I wasn't here
long enough to do any damage.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.728
Well, we're sorry to lose you.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.989
Always better to hang onto
a good tenant when we find one.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.462
Thanks, but it's a great
apartment. I don't think

16:16.500 --> 16:18.104
you're gonna have trouble
finding a new tenant.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.438
Well, actually
we already have one.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.777
Wow, that's fast, right?

16:21.810 --> 16:23.675
I mean, even by
New York standards.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.200
Apparently the guy wanted
the place sight unseen.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.706
Don't know
how he heard about it.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.513
We hadn't even
listed the place yet.

16:28.550 --> 16:29.710
Only thing he asked for

16:29.750 --> 16:31.149
was an upgrade
on the front lock.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.010
He sent over his own deadbolt.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.357
It's made by some
high-end company.

16:34.390 --> 16:37.382
Supposed to be unpickable.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.284
Fenstermacher?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.025
Yeah. How'd you know?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.764
Michael Cardenas,
this is Detective Marcus Bell.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.633
Our consultant Sherlock Holmes.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.729
This is Gayle Wilkins.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.499
Aceway Airlines'

16:54.540 --> 16:55.700
house counsel.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.571
Really appreciate
you coming down.

16:57.610 --> 16:58.747
Frankly, we preferred it

16:58.780 --> 17:00.372
to you coming to us.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.479
Media's been camped on
our doorstep all day.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.738
We'd rather not give them a
shot of the police stopping by.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.781
Some _|unatic's out there
gunning people down,

17:06.820 --> 17:08.708
and they're making us
the bad guys.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.126
You know they're calling him
the Aceway Killer?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.787
HOLMES:
I can't even imagine
how infuriating

17:12.830 --> 17:14.127
that must be
when you worked so hard

17:14.160 --> 17:16.151
to earn that moniker
all by yourself.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.758
Excuse me?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.665
81 people are dead.
According to

17:19.700 --> 17:21.065
an official investigation,
it's because

17:21.100 --> 17:22.829
you chose to pinch pennies
on maintenance.

17:22.870 --> 17:25.668
We are still contesting the
results of that investigation.

17:25.710 --> 17:28.076
No criminal charges
have been filed.

17:28.110 --> 17:31.079
I hope that's not what you
asked us here to talk about.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.179
If you've been
following the news,

17:32.210 --> 17:33.768
you know that the killer claims

17:33.820 --> 17:35.469
that he's helping you.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.111
Crazy people say crazy things.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.128
Arlen Schrader had much
the same reaction

17:43.160 --> 17:45.128
when the killer made
reference to him.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.787
BELL:
You're familiar
with Mr. Schrader, correct?

17:46.830 --> 17:48.252
You talked to him
about administrating

17:48.300 --> 17:49.824
your victims' comp?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.498
You think that's
why we were targeted?

17:51.530 --> 17:53.168
Because the killer has
a problem with him?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.428
It's one possibility.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.267
Another possibility
is that the killer

17:56.300 --> 17:58.803
is not motivated by crazy,
but by greed.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.206
BELL:
We thought it was interesting
he went out of his way

18:01.240 --> 18:02.673
to ding Aceway
when you and Schrader

18:02.710 --> 18:04.507
weren't even in business yet.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.177
Mr. Holmes here
wondered if the killer

18:06.210 --> 18:07.416
was an attorney
in the same field.

18:07.450 --> 18:08.678
Someone who stood to benefit

18:08.720 --> 18:10.608
if Schrader dropped
out of the race.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.208
Wait, you think all this

18:12.250 --> 18:14.252
is about forcing our hand?

18:14.290 --> 18:16.758
Who else did you talk to
about your problem?

18:16.790 --> 18:18.451
Well, locally there
are two other firms

18:18.490 --> 18:20.128
that do what Schrader does.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.627
We talked to both of them.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.423
But it wouldn't make
any sense for them

18:23.470 --> 18:24.767
to do something like this.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.597
This rampage makes them

18:26.630 --> 18:29.690
as radioactive as him.
What do you mean?

18:29.740 --> 18:31.264
WILKINS: He's not the
only one with a formula

18:31.310 --> 18:33.130
to calculate a decedent's worth.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.704
We still need

18:34.740 --> 18:36.537
to discuss it with the
board, but we believe

18:36.580 --> 18:38.138
we may need someone
with a less...

18:38.180 --> 18:40.216
stratified approach.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.219
You want a firm that will settle
the claims with a fixed sum.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.649
Rather than pay the victims

18:44.690 --> 18:45.918
according to their wealth,

18:45.950 --> 18:48.418
all parties would get
the same amount.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.916
Why not do that all along?

18:49.960 --> 18:52.451
It would cost them more money.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.651
What are the numbers?
The payouts that you would make

18:54.700 --> 18:57.419
using Schrader's formula
or at least your sense of them?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.222
Well, setting aside crew,

18:59.270 --> 19:00.931
there were eight first class
passengers on the flight.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.665
Each was well off.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.531
We figure their families
would receive

19:04.570 --> 19:05.730
somewhere in the range

19:05.770 --> 19:07.408
of $10 million
to $15 million.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.204
There were 67
passengers in coach.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.901
Assuming average incomes
and life expectancies,

19:12.950 --> 19:15.214
their survivors
would only receive

19:15.250 --> 19:16.877
a few hundred thousand.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.945
And if you switched
to the fixed sum?

19:18.990 --> 19:21.652
Everyone gets about $5 million.

19:21.690 --> 19:24.818
Captain and Detective, a word?

19:24.860 --> 19:26.350
(door opens)

19:27.960 --> 19:30.155
GREGSON:
Would you excuse us a moment?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.397
(door closes)
So...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.192
we can agree that Mr. Cardenas
and his attorney

19:36.240 --> 19:38.231
have just helped identify
a new suspect pool?

19:38.270 --> 19:40.238
Beneficiaries of the
lower-income Victims

19:40.280 --> 19:41.838
of Flight 1059.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.404
Schrader's formula
would've factored in

19:43.450 --> 19:44.974
those victims_'
earning potential.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.342
Their families would've
gotten less money.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.245
So, if you smear Schrader,
smear Aceway,

19:49.280 --> 19:50.884
and the airline's hands
are tied.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.785
Fixed sum is the only way to go.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.912
You said you were
preparing a list

19:53.960 --> 19:55.712
of the beneficiaries.
Can I see it?

19:58.290 --> 20:00.258
MALE NEWS ANCHOR:
The murders have sparked

20:00.300 --> 20:02.689
a growing controversy over
the way companies like Aceway

20:02.730 --> 20:04.891
calculate victims' compensation.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.693
According to a statement
from the airlines,

20:06.730 --> 20:07.890
they've made no decision

20:07.940 --> 20:09.965
yet about Flight 1059,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.935
and are currently exploring
all their options.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.905
In the meantime,
the airline expressed sympathy

20:15.940 --> 20:17.646
for the two shooting victims,
and its hope

20:17.680 --> 20:19.568
that whoever is responsible
(doorbell rings)

20:19.610 --> 20:20.918
will be quickly found.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.918
Penny?

20:22.950 --> 20:24.281
You forgot I was coming?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.639
No, I've just been busy.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.782
I can see.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.811
Can I come in?

20:31.990 --> 20:33.491
You're redecorating?

20:33.530 --> 20:35.259
It's been a few years.
I wanted a change.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.892
Dana. . ._
You're my Sister,

20:36.930 --> 20:39.797
not my mother.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.434
Today I'm neither.

20:41.470 --> 20:42.596
I'm your accountant.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.267
And it's time to face facts.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.629
You can't afford
to live this way.

20:45.670 --> 20:48.434
Not anymore.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.542
I'm trying to help you.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.474
Have you been watching the news?

20:56.520 --> 20:57.942
It's tax season.
I've been underwater. Why?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.788
I think things are
gonna get better

21:00.820 --> 21:02.356
for me.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.483
I'm going to be able
to pay what I owe.

21:04.530 --> 21:05.883
What are you talking about?

21:05.930 --> 21:07.693
I'm working on something,
a project.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.652
If you've invested with another
of those hedge fund guys,

21:09.700 --> 21:10.667
I swear to God...

21:10.700 --> 21:12.463
I'm not stupid, Penny.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.496
I'm sorry.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.668
Is this "project" going
to pay out in the next 90 days?

21:18.710 --> 21:19.836
The money is tied up.

21:19.870 --> 21:20.973
It's complicated.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.006
This came
from the bank today.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.369
They're gonna take
the house.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.948
If you want to get any
money out of it at all,

21:31.990 --> 21:34.311
you have to sell now.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.316
I can do it.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.021
Get the money sooner.

21:38.060 --> 21:39.789
How?
Well, I've already
made a fuss about it.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.799
I just have to make
a bigger fuss.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.529
What, did you run out
of room in the basement?

21:54.580 --> 21:57.799
I have risen,
as per your instructions.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.806
Well, I thought you
were at the station,

21:59.850 --> 22:01.818
so I went there after
my walk-through.

22:01.850 --> 22:05.445
Marcus brought
me up to speed.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.709
So I take it the amounts are
how much Schrader would say

22:08.760 --> 22:11.354
each person on the crashed
plane was worth?

22:11.390 --> 22:15.349
Mm-hmm, my approximation
with the help of the airline.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.367
Here in the proverbial cheap
seats is where we find

22:20.400 --> 22:22.391
the victims whose survivors
would benefit most

22:22.440 --> 22:23.805
from uniform
settlements.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.808
Pveidenﬁﬁed
three such beneficiaries

22:25.840 --> 22:29.401
who live locally and had
a history of violent crime.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.670
Seems reasonable to look
at them first, eh?

22:31.710 --> 22:33.974
Oh, that reminds me-- Marcus
gave me a ballistics report.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.817
It confirms that the
same gun was used

22:35.850 --> 22:38.148
to kill Wilseck
and Duncan.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.146
It was _traced back
to a private trader

22:40.190 --> 22:41.748
at a gun show
in Virginia.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.678
A state which requires
no paperwork

22:43.730 --> 22:45.083
for such
a transaction.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.086
No, but the seller
remembered the buyer.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.597
Sort of.

22:48.630 --> 22:50.427
White male, 405,
walked with a limp.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.062
Would you get the appropriate
photographs to him,

22:52.100 --> 22:54.398
see if he recognizes any of
the crash victims' loved ones?

22:54.440 --> 22:55.338
Marcus is_
already on it.

22:55.370 --> 22:57.099
But unfortunately
there is no guarantee

22:57.140 --> 22:59.108
that the gun is still in
the buyer's possession.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.698
He could have sold
it to someone,

23:00.740 --> 23:02.173
who sold it so someone,
who sold it to someone.

23:02.210 --> 23:04.098
And God bless America.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.947
Are we completely
off the idea

23:05.980 --> 23:08.574
that the killer is a
rival of Schrader's?

23:08.620 --> 23:10.110
We've put that to one side.

23:10.150 --> 23:12.983
This new suspect pool is more
viable and better defined.

23:18.190 --> 23:20.181
Why did you rent
my apartment?

23:20.230 --> 23:22.926
That was you, right?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.599
I mean, Fenstermacher
is your lock of choice.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.666
And we both know how much
you hated my old one.

23:27.700 --> 23:31.101
I was assured that work
would not be done today.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.107
Yesterday, it was obvious

23:32.140 --> 23:34.472
that you did not want me
to get rid of my things.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.670
And then you worked in
the basement, you said

23:35.710 --> 23:37.029
that you did not
want to bother me.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.469
But maybe you didn't
want me bothering you.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.478
Now, if you did not want me to
move back into the brownstone,

23:41.520 --> 23:42.509
you could have just said so.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.916
(cell phone rings)

23:49.660 --> 23:51.878
Captain.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.127
The Aceway Killer struck again.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.128
Or at least he tried to strike.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.539
Took a shot through a window
out here in Nassau County.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.458
Got spooked and ran off.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.936
The woman he was after was
only shaken up, luckily.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.631
She's gonna be all right.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.569
I take it she also had family
on Flight 1059?

24:10.610 --> 24:11.770
Mm.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.778
Her husband.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.448
The local PD is taking
her statement now.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.888
She didn't get a good
look at the shooter,

24:19.920 --> 24:22.480
so she may not be able
to help us much anyway.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.124
But who knows?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.458
Maybe she'll surprise us.

24:34.070 --> 24:35.628
I was walking into the kitchen,

24:35.670 --> 24:38.662
and I saw the man
standing about there.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.678
He was wearing a ski mask.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.234
He looked right at me,

24:42.280 --> 24:45.249
and he pulled out
a gun and fired.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.249
So I ran, I-I made it
to the alarm panel.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.885
And I hit
the panic button.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.286
_ Mrs. Powell's service
includes an on-SIte alarm

24:53.320 --> 24:54.753
and notification
of 911.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.587
We figure he ran
when he heard it go off.

24:56.620 --> 25:00.590
Nassau police found a set
of men's shoe prints.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.621
Looks like he fired
from here,

25:02.660 --> 25:04.719
then ran to the back fence
and scaled it.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.298
Did you notice that
the shooter had a limp?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.160
I'm sorry, what?

25:10.200 --> 25:12.236
Well, the, uh,
the left shoe

25:12.270 --> 25:14.238
that, you know,
made this footprint

25:14.280 --> 25:16.737
is worn away
on its inside edge, so...

25:16.780 --> 25:20.170
It was dark-- I-I hid as soon
as I got to the alarm.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.075
I don't think
I saw him walk at all.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.884
WATSON: The gun dealer
you spoke to described a man

25:24.920 --> 25:26.319
who had trouble
walking.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.716
That could explain
the uneven wear.
Mmm.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.978
Gun dealer?
Yeah, we thought
we had a lead

25:31.030 --> 25:32.725
on where the
weapon came from,

25:32.760 --> 25:34.728
but I sent the dealer the
pictures we talked about.

25:34.760 --> 25:35.749
No luck.

25:43.070 --> 25:46.198
So, does anyone else
live here with you?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.264
No, why?

25:47.310 --> 25:48.902
Well, I just,
I noticed

25:48.940 --> 25:50.908
that your bedroom's
on the ground floor.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.043
That's just unusual
in a house this size.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.039
Well, after Nick,
uh, my husband, died,

25:57.080 --> 26:00.789
the house just felt too big,
so I moved downstairs.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.952
Our condolences
on your loss.

26:04.990 --> 26:07.151
(door opens)

26:07.190 --> 26:08.657
Police canvassed
the neighborhood and asked

26:08.700 --> 26:11.123
if anyone saw the shooter
coming or going,

26:11.170 --> 26:12.762
but most people
were asleep.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.995
In the meantime, the dealer
who sold the gun is sitting

26:15.040 --> 26:16.268
with_a sketch artist
in Virginia.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.666
We should have
something soon.

26:18.710 --> 26:23.306
A shame he didn't identify any
of our white male beneficiaries.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.308
I still believe that
the killer is connected

26:25.350 --> 26:27.341
to a victim of
Flight 1059.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.318
Why did you ask
about Dana Powell's bedroom

26:32.350 --> 26:34.181
being downstairs?

26:34.220 --> 26:35.949
It was nothing.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.958
My brain's struggling to bring
a hazy scene into focus.

26:37.990 --> 26:39.787
I thought there might
have been another witness

26:39.830 --> 26:41.798
with whom we
could speak.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.991
In any event, that is
no longer the feature

26:44.030 --> 26:46.396
of Mrs. Powell's property
which interests me the most.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.763
That distinction
presently falls...

26:49.800 --> 26:51.734
to this fence.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.978
The shooter entered
and exited the property

26:55.010 --> 26:56.978
by climbing over it here.

26:57.010 --> 26:59.979
The evidence suggests
he has a physical disability.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.979
There are easier points
of egress and ingress,

27:03.020 --> 27:04.783
so why choose this one?

27:04.820 --> 27:06.742
So he wouldn't be seen?

27:06.790 --> 27:09.759
Mm, that in turn raises
other questions.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.155
In both of the previous murders,

27:11.190 --> 27:13.750
the killer was_ in _close
prOXImity to his Victims

27:13.800 --> 27:14.949
when he pulled the trigger.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.797
Right in their personal space.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.718
He shot Mr. Duncan
in his own kitchen.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.830
Maybe Duncan knew him,
trusted him.

27:21.870 --> 27:24.839
Here, in contrast,
we have a ham-fisted attempt

27:24.870 --> 27:27.805
to sneak up on Mrs. Powell
through her backyard.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.807
It's out of character.

27:28.840 --> 27:29.829
Something's different.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.644
You two need
to see this.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.788
REPORTER: The police are sure
it was the Aceway Killer?

27:39.820 --> 27:41.913
Well, I don't see how
there could be any doubt.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.326
My husband was
on Flight 1059.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.851
REPORTER: Are you afraid
he might come after you again?

27:49.360 --> 27:52.818
The man who's doing this
seems to have a problem

27:52.870 --> 27:54.963
with the way certain
families may be compensated

27:55.000 --> 27:56.695
by the airline.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.868
He seems to think that everyone
should be treated the same.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.707
But you know what?

28:01.740 --> 28:04.345
My husband was a
commodities broker.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.348
He made something of himself.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.372
He worked hard,
he earned millions.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.389
What exactly
are you saying, Mrs. Powell?

28:12.420 --> 28:14.388
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm
supposed to stand here

28:14.420 --> 28:18.379
and say that my husband wasn't
worth more than a teacher?

28:18.430 --> 28:19.385
Or a waitress?

28:19.430 --> 28:20.897
Or a garbage man?

28:20.930 --> 28:23.296
Nick made something of himself.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.924
So did some of the other
people on that plane.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.938
Why shouldn't they
be recognized?

28:27.970 --> 28:30.234
Why shouldn't their
families receive more?

28:30.270 --> 28:34.070
The term "tone-deaf"
comes to mind.

28:34.110 --> 28:37.034
How did she think that was gonna
play to the guy on the street?

28:37.080 --> 28:39.048
WATSON: Not to mention
the Aceway boardroom.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.844
If they're still on the fence
about settling claims

28:41.880 --> 28:43.472
with ﬁxed sums,
they won't be for long.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.943
She probably just gave the
killer exactly what he wants.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.826
DANA:
Nick made something of himself.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.852
So did some of the other people
on that plane.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.856
Why shouldn't
they be recognized?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.993
Why shouldn't their families
receive more?

28:58.030 --> 28:59.793
Marcus called-- the sketch
from the gun dealer

28:59.830 --> 29:00.967
should be here soon.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.399
He'll e-mail us
once he gets it.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.466
Aceway Airlines released
a statement an hour ago.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.172
As expected, they're
settling everyone's claims

29:08.210 --> 29:09.768
via a fixed sum.

29:09.810 --> 29:10.845
Well, after
that interview,

29:10.880 --> 29:12.142
I don't think
they had much choice.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.408
Interesting woman, no?

29:13.450 --> 29:15.418
We saw none of this outrage
this morning.

29:15.450 --> 29:17.247
Yet, the moment there's
a camera in front of her...

29:17.280 --> 29:19.089
She lost
her husband,

29:19.120 --> 29:21.486
and someone tried
to kill her last night.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.829
You think those details
explain her outburst?

29:23.860 --> 29:25.987
What, you think
almost dying is a detail?

29:26.030 --> 29:28.999
Captain Gregson's
been keeping me apprised

29:29.030 --> 29:32.329
as the police continue to locate
and question the beneficiaries.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.338
One of them, a woman
who lost her son,

29:34.370 --> 29:36.099
has been attending a
grief counseling group

29:36.140 --> 29:37.937
for the last
ten months.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.939
Freddy Duncan, the Aceway
Killer's second victim,

29:40.980 --> 29:43.574
was also a member.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.771
As was Dana Powell.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.578
Wait, what are you saying?

29:49.620 --> 29:52.111
You think she's the killer?

29:52.150 --> 29:53.959
I think she may be the killer.

29:53.990 --> 29:55.582
Or at least one of them.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.827
We've still yet to identify
the man with the limp.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.852
Mrs. Powell and Mr.
Duncan were known to chat

30:00.900 --> 30:02.856
before and
after meetings,

30:02.900 --> 30:04.868
so perhaps she was gathering
information, gaining his trust.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.868
She might have done the
same with Henry Wilseck,

30:06.900 --> 30:09.039
although we'll never be
able to confirm that.

30:09.070 --> 30:11.038
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.867
I mean, her husband was
a commodities broker.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.901
He was in the prime
of life.

30:14.940 --> 30:18.546
She stood to make two, maybe
three, times what she will now.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.548
Why would she go
to all this trouble

30:20.580 --> 30:22.309
just to have the airline
pay her less?

30:22.350 --> 30:26.138
That's precisely the question
I've been asking myself.

30:30.260 --> 30:34.856
Yesterday, you asked me
why I held on to your apartment.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.993
You worry that I'm
having second thoughts

30:37.030 --> 30:38.588
about your return here.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.962
I merely question your haste.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.104
The timing of it all.

30:47.140 --> 30:50.132
So I took steps to keep
your options open.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.977
For your benefit.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.238
Do you want me
living here or not?

30:53.280 --> 30:56.044
I do-- I have never
wavered on that.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.638
Even having you here
the last few days

30:57.680 --> 31:00.080
has had a measurable benefit
to our process.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.656
Then what is it?

31:01.690 --> 31:03.658
For a long time,
I have argued

31:03.690 --> 31:07.148
that you should fully embrace
the life of a detective.

31:07.190 --> 31:10.591
You've always had
a valid rebuttal.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.569
I might not share your need
for a more balanced existence,

31:15.600 --> 31:18.205
but I accept it.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.937
Now, abruptly, my words hold
more truth for you.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.446
In your rush to shed the skin
of your former self,

31:26.480 --> 31:28.448
you're abandoning
your belongings

31:28.480 --> 31:30.573
as if leaving the site
of a contamination.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.248
You think this is
all about Andrew?

31:33.290 --> 31:35.087
How could it not be?

31:52.010 --> 31:53.534
I know that
you and Andrew

31:53.570 --> 31:55.401
were only together
for a short while.

31:58.310 --> 32:00.301
But I worry that,
in the aftermath of a trauma,

32:00.350 --> 32:02.545
you might be...

32:02.580 --> 32:05.447
overadjusting.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.446
That moving back
might not be

32:07.490 --> 32:10.186
the progression that
you believe it to be,

32:10.220 --> 32:13.383
but might be
a regression,

32:13.430 --> 32:16.422
a retreat into
the safety of the known.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.634
I suppose I just
want to ensure

32:21.670 --> 32:24.036
that_I haven't been
too qUIck to encourage.

32:24.070 --> 32:25.537
That I haven't
unWIttingly cast myself

32:25.570 --> 32:27.106
in the role of enabler.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.334
Maybe I don't know
how much of this

32:28.380 --> 32:29.574
is a reaction to what happened.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.146
Maybe I do need
a safe place right now.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.045
Is that so bad?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.048
Is there something wrong with me
feeling like this is home?

32:36.350 --> 32:38.944
(phone chimes)

32:43.060 --> 32:44.550
It's the sketch
of the man

32:44.590 --> 32:46.023
who bought the gun
in Virginia,

32:46.060 --> 32:47.288
the man with
the limp.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.096
What if I told you

32:51.130 --> 32:53.121
that he died
over a year ago?

32:53.170 --> 32:55.058
In a plane crash?

32:55.100 --> 32:56.590
With 80 other people?

33:00.070 --> 33:01.776
WATSON:
Nick Powell.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.038
Dana's husband?

33:03.080 --> 33:06.106
It's not an exact match.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.141
Sketches rarely are.

33:09.050 --> 33:11.189
But look at the widow's peak.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.188
Bridge of the nose.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.584
If you're right,
if her husband was

33:16.620 --> 33:18.178
the one who bought
the murder weapon...

33:18.230 --> 33:19.686
Then I dare say I'm right,

33:19.730 --> 33:22.028
she's involved in the killings.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.174
The question remains:

33:35.210 --> 33:36.370
why go to such lengths

33:36.410 --> 33:38.071
to make the airline
pay out less money?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.678
Actually, I don't think
she would get less.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.153
I think she'd get more.

33:48.190 --> 33:49.384
Her husband's
life

33:49.420 --> 33:51.581
may not have been worth much
after all.

34:00.130 --> 34:03.361
RADIO REPORTER:
According to an official press
release from Aceway Airlines,

34:03.400 --> 34:06.107
the decision to expedite
the claims process

34:06.140 --> 34:07.767
was made in the hopes it will

34:07.810 --> 34:10.176
allow the families
affected by Flight 1059

34:10.210 --> 34:14.613
to find whatever closure they
can as quickly as possible.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.572
Aceway was quick to add,
however,

34:16.620 --> 34:19.680
that this is not _
an admi55ion of wrongd0ing.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.711
(door opens, shuts)

34:24.190 --> 34:26.488
Penny?

34:26.530 --> 34:28.225
You didn't call me
yesterday.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.852
Someone tried
to kill you

34:29.900 --> 34:31.424
and you didn't...

34:32.900 --> 34:35.164
Why are you crying?

34:35.200 --> 34:36.565
A few friends called me

34:36.600 --> 34:38.409
after they saw you
on the news yesterday.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.658
They were... surprised

34:40.710 --> 34:42.109
by what you said.

34:42.140 --> 34:44.142
You don't think I deserve more?

34:45.480 --> 34:48.870
You remember when
I graduated college?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.774
You couldn't understand
why Mom and Dad

34:50.820 --> 34:52.344
would pay for
grad school for me,

34:52.390 --> 34:54.255
but not buy
you a car.

34:54.290 --> 34:56.884
Right after that, you left home.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.559
And I've done fine for myself.

34:59.590 --> 35:00.852
Of course you have.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.721
You always do.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.628
Aceway's settling.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.604
I heard.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.130
You must be happy.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.602
No, I'm...
relieved.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.177
Now I don't have
to sell the house.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.746
Not this year.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.513
You know that I love you, right?

35:29.560 --> 35:31.357
That you can tell me anything.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.188
What would I have
to tell you?

35:34.230 --> 35:35.891
You've always had a...

35:35.930 --> 35:38.364
fixation when it comes to money.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.164
When it comes to
what you... deserve.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.158
The person who killed
those two men

35:45.210 --> 35:47.166
seems to have one, too.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.916
I just want to help you.

35:54.950 --> 35:58.249
I thought it was interesting,

35:58.290 --> 36:01.259
the way he left
that money behind.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.258
The killer?

36:07.430 --> 36:09.625
Yesterday,
he could've afforded me;

36:09.660 --> 36:11.321
today he can't.

36:13.230 --> 36:16.336
The world is funny that way.

36:20.670 --> 36:24.208
How much do you think
you're worth, Penny?

36:30.550 --> 36:32.313
(knocking at door)

36:32.350 --> 36:33.908
OFFICER:
Dana Powell! Police!

36:33.950 --> 36:36.180
Open the door!
We have a warrant!

36:38.330 --> 36:39.354
I didn't call them.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.698
_ We found these
in your bedroom closet.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.937
They match the impressions

36:49.970 --> 36:51.767
we found in your backyard.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.278
That's because you used these
to make them.

36:54.310 --> 36:55.868
You faked the attempt
on your life, didn't you?

36:55.910 --> 36:58.299
You don't have
to answer that question.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.306
These were your
husband's shoes.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.476
Nick?

37:01.520 --> 37:02.873
Who was killed
on Flight 1059?

37:02.920 --> 37:04.683
So?
Mrs. Powell...

37:04.720 --> 37:06.938
This is really all about
your husband, is it not?

37:06.990 --> 37:08.981
Or, rather, the life
that you had with him,

37:09.020 --> 37:11.329
that you still believe
you're entitled to.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.021
The life you had
before tragedy struck.

37:13.060 --> 37:15.551
I'm not talking
about the plane crash.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.454
I'm talking about
the first tragedy.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.024
WATSON:
The gun dealer in Virginia

37:19.070 --> 37:20.423
identified your husband

37:20.470 --> 37:22.688
as the man he sold the gun to.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.901
Nick lost partial use
of one of his legs.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.737
That's why you moved your
bedroom to the ground floor.

37:26.770 --> 37:29.034
He could no longer
make it up the stairs.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.378
He also developed
dysconjugate gaze,

37:31.410 --> 37:34.311
a misalignment of the eyes
due to weakened muscle control.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.272
Both are symptoms
of glioblastoma,

37:36.320 --> 37:38.584
a highly aggressive brain tumor.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.588
Now, a man develops
a brain tumor,

37:40.620 --> 37:42.451
his symptoms come on fast,

37:42.490 --> 37:44.321
and then he buys a gun.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.329
Now, maybe he was thinking
about taking his own life.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.396
Maybe he just wanted you
to feel safe

37:49.430 --> 37:50.988
after he was gone.

37:51.030 --> 37:52.622
Either way, it wasn't long

37:52.670 --> 37:54.638
before he started taking
regular flights to Vermont.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.764
Well, we were thinking about
buying a second home in Stowe.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.802
It's not a crime to like to ski.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.001
Neither is
physician-assisted suicide.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.942
At least, not in Vermont.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.845
Your husband was planning

38:06.880 --> 38:08.541
to establish residency,
was he not?

38:08.580 --> 38:11.413
Looking to avail himself
of the state's laws.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.589
Even if Nick
had not died in a plane crash,

38:13.620 --> 38:15.679
I'm guessing he only had
a few months to live.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.914
HOLMES:
You realized that

38:16.960 --> 38:18.382
if the airline hired
Arlen Schrader,

38:18.430 --> 38:19.658
his investigation would uncover

38:19.690 --> 38:20.918
your husband's illness.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.052
He would factor in

38:22.100 --> 38:23.556
Nick's tragically short
life expectancy

38:23.600 --> 38:26.068
and you would receive
a small amount.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.898
If the airline, however,
paid a fixed sum,

38:28.940 --> 38:31.363
you'd get millions.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.366
_ LAWYER:
This is some _tale
you're spinning.

38:33.410 --> 38:34.832
But so far,
I don't hear a thing

38:34.880 --> 38:36.438
that connects
Mrs. Powell to any murders.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.936
Her husband
bought the gun

38:37.980 --> 38:40.369
that was used to kill Henry
Wilseck and Freddy Duncan.

38:40.410 --> 38:42.412
_That's not
in question.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.680
Now, neither is the
fact that it was used

38:44.720 --> 38:46.745
to fire a bullet through
her window the other night.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.587
Now, the gun
hasn't turned up.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.917
Doesn't mean
it won't.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.123
Even without it,
I like our chances.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.720
The captain believes there
might be a deal to be struck.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.421
That you will
spend the bulk

38:57.460 --> 38:58.893
of your remaining days
in prison is...

38:58.930 --> 39:01.797
well, it's a virtual certainty.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.502
What kind of prison,
on the other hand...

39:06.710 --> 39:08.132
You can find yourself
in a hole in the ground...

39:08.170 --> 39:09.808
Or a room with a view.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.979
Somewhere with a yard,
exercise equipment.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.808
More white-collar criminals
than blue.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.147
I mean...

39:16.180 --> 39:20.116
it really just comes
down to this, Mrs. Powell:

39:20.150 --> 39:23.415
what do you think you deserve?

39:28.830 --> 39:30.718
Hey. I've got
something to show you.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.399
It's in the
basement.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.600
(door creaks)

39:46.750 --> 39:48.638
(nail gun firing)

39:48.680 --> 39:50.671
Is that a nail gun?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.187
(nail gun continues firing)

39:52.220 --> 39:53.517
WATSON:
Be right down!

39:53.550 --> 39:55.859
I'm gonna use
the other door.

40:19.210 --> 40:22.111
(footsteps approaching)

40:23.220 --> 40:24.744
So, what do you think?

40:24.790 --> 40:27.179
I think you've taken me up

40:27.220 --> 40:29.188
on my offer
to store some of your things.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.189
Well, I am not storing them,

40:32.230 --> 40:34.084
I am arranging them.

40:34.130 --> 40:35.927
You were right.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.019
It took me a while _
to get my balance again

40:38.060 --> 40:40.460
and I don't want to lose that,
I don't want to give it up.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.934
So I decided to claim
a little space of my own.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.528
In the basement.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.561
Well, it's not perfect,
but it'll be mine.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.963
And for either of us
to get down here,

40:48.010 --> 40:49.807
we'll have to physically
leave the brownstone.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.505
I mean, maybe it
sounds a little weird...

40:53.550 --> 40:54.812
No, not at all.

40:54.850 --> 40:56.818
(stammering):
You know, I once walled myself

40:56.850 --> 40:59.489
into a section of 2213.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.613
I did not leave
access to a door,

41:01.660 --> 41:04.481
nor did I require one for
several weeks. But, um...

41:04.530 --> 41:06.987
Well, I'll keep
my bedroom upstairs

41:07.030 --> 41:08.588
and I'll work down here.

41:08.630 --> 41:10.257
And I can have meetings
with my own clients.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.928
This way, you'll feel a little
less like you're enabling me.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.633
Um, I'm going to need
a couple of days

41:17.670 --> 41:19.604
to clear some things out.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.528
Some, uh, experiments.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.172
Prolonged exposure
could present a...

41:23.210 --> 41:24.575
health risk.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.942
All right,
I'm not going to stop you.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.247
Well, then, I suppose
I should see someone

41:30.280 --> 41:32.043
about backing out of a lease.
