00:10.500 --> 00:13.280
<i>A man died while fighting the monsters.</i>

00:13.790 --> 00:17.490
<i>And just like in the game, 
he revived at the Cathedral.</i>

00:18.330 --> 00:19.320
I'm alive...

00:19.320 --> 00:21.110
I came back to life?

00:21.110 --> 00:22.420
Seriously?

00:22.420 --> 00:23.480
But doesn't that mean...

00:23.820 --> 00:25.160
I'm alive again.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.980
<i>The MMORPG </i>Elder Tale<i>...</i>

00:30.860 --> 00:34.770
<i>Without warning, an estimated thirty 
thousand Japanese alone,</i>

00:35.450 --> 00:37.510
<i>and several hundred thousand worldwide,</i>

00:38.200 --> 00:40.200
<i>were trapped in a world just like the game.</i>

00:41.010 --> 00:45.270
<i>And in this world, death is not the end.</i>

02:20.520 --> 02:21.570
<i>Astral Bind!</i>

02:26.540 --> 02:27.000
<b>Slice</b>

02:28.590 --> 02:30.080
And we're done.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.290
Let's call it quits for today.

02:33.430 --> 02:34.500
Understood.

02:35.870 --> 02:40.550
<i>Our bodies seem to know the 
basic combat movements.</i>

02:41.960 --> 02:43.330
<i>Even if we don't use commands,</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:47.050
<i>as long as we intend to fight, 
and can see the enemy in front of us,</i>

02:47.050 --> 02:50.150
<i>we can use skills and magic in a 
manner similar to voice input.</i>

02:51.450 --> 02:56.240
<i>But there's a difference between 
"using" and "mastering."</i>

02:57.480 --> 02:59.470
<i>We'll need some practice.</i>

03:00.970 --> 03:06.110
<i>Though, I don't know if practicing the way 
martial artists do in our world will be enough...</i>

03:07.610 --> 03:08.610
My lord Shiro...

03:09.130 --> 03:12.280
Akatsuki, would you stop calling me that?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.170
Just call me Shiroe.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.670
Then I hope you'll treat me 
with the same familiarity.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.800
You two sure are enjoying the height of youth!

03:20.800 --> 03:22.680
What're you talking about?

03:22.800 --> 03:28.680
<b>The Battle of Loka</b>

03:25.320 --> 03:26.840
The Battle of Loka.

03:29.420 --> 03:30.190
My lord.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.290
I'll go ahead, to reconnoiter on our way home.

03:35.290 --> 03:36.560
Why?

03:36.970 --> 03:37.860
Practice.

03:38.470 --> 03:41.040
One of the assassin's skills is Dark Vision.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.010
And I also have Sneak and Silent Move.

03:44.330 --> 03:47.520
This forest is the perfect place to practice.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.120
I see.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.150
Okay, we'll meet by the south gate.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.040
We'll stay illuminated using Magic Light as we go.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.640
You can use that to find us.

03:56.990 --> 03:57.870
Understood.

03:59.470 --> 04:02.640
Then Akatsuki's subclass is tracker?

04:02.640 --> 04:05.090
I couldn't even hear the leaves rustle.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.390
She's good.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.140
<i>Magic Light.</i>

04:09.570 --> 04:11.750
<i>The skills Akatsuki mentioned,</i>

04:11.750 --> 04:16.060
<i>Sneak and Silent Move, are tracker skills.</i>

04:17.080 --> 04:19.900
<i>Tracker is a subclass.</i>

04:20.630 --> 04:23.100
<i>Players in </i>Elder Tale<i> can select</i>

04:23.100 --> 04:26.110
<i>from twelve main combat classes,</i>

04:26.110 --> 04:29.200
<i>and then choose among any number of subclasses.</i>

04:30.150 --> 04:32.280
An assassin and a tracker, huh?

04:32.280 --> 04:34.030
No wonder she calls herself a ninja.

04:34.030 --> 04:36.250
She's a hardcore role-player.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.920
Come to think of it, how many 
days have we been here?

04:41.140 --> 04:44.800
Security in town is getting really bad.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.080
Yes.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.790
The rush to buy guild halls has calmed,

04:48.790 --> 04:51.310
and I suppose the balance of power in the city

04:51.310 --> 04:53.350
has been more or less established.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.060
Adventurers in the larger guilds 
wield their influence freely,

04:57.060 --> 05:00.670
and somehow, the smaller guilds 
have become even smaller.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.570
They act like anyone not in their 
own guild is an enemy.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.440
But there's no fighting in towns, right?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.670
<i>Fighting wasn't allowed in the majority of towns</i>

05:11.670 --> 05:13.830
<i>when </i>Elder Tale<i> was a game.</i>

05:14.380 --> 05:16.580
<i>So if you fight in town,</i>

05:17.880 --> 05:20.510
<i>powerful enforcers called the Royal Guard appear.</i>

05:21.520 --> 05:22.610
<i>And just like in the game,</i>

05:22.610 --> 05:25.190
<i>if you resist, they'll kill you without mercy.</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:28.920
I'm told there's a lot of low-level 
fighting and harassment

05:28.920 --> 05:30.560
that doesn't quite count as combat.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.890
In the past few days, PKs have rapidly increased.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.140
PKs?

05:36.600 --> 05:37.820
Player killings.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.650
Or player killers.

05:39.930 --> 05:45.240
They attack players, rather than monsters, 
and then steal items and money.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.780
It's the worst thing you could do.

05:47.750 --> 05:51.130
Outside of town, you can't use your mini-map,

05:51.130 --> 05:53.160
and you can't contact the Game Masters.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.770
And surprise attacks are far more effective.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.090
It's much less risky now.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.540
The pros and cons have reversed positions.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.920
That must be why it's more common now.

06:03.570 --> 06:04.960
How cowardly.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.750
If Akihabara keeps getting worse...

06:10.190 --> 06:11.360
Is something wrong?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.230
What?

06:12.230 --> 06:13.810
Ah, it's nothing.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.270
What a problem!

06:16.270 --> 06:17.480
Don't you agree, Naotsugu?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.970
Hey! Get off me!

06:20.970 --> 06:26.600
I was just so taken by Akatsuki's 
cuteness, I forgot to breathe!

06:26.600 --> 06:29.070
Right, Akatsuki?

06:30.910 --> 06:32.210
What's wrong, Shiro?

06:32.210 --> 06:33.400
Nothing.

06:35.430 --> 06:39.000
I don't think you need to feel 
so bound by duty all the time.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.590
I mean, there's no need to hold back!

06:42.990 --> 06:45.090
What do you mean?

06:45.320 --> 06:46.950
Hey, shrimp!

06:46.950 --> 06:48.340
Don't call me a shrimp!

06:48.700 --> 06:50.640
See any gobs?

06:50.640 --> 06:53.350
I like the one with the skull on his head.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.150
It's weird and cute.

06:55.150 --> 06:56.320
Seriously?

07:08.160 --> 07:09.360
Is it human?

07:09.860 --> 07:11.010
Which means...

07:16.090 --> 07:17.310
Thanks!

07:17.310 --> 07:19.890
You're always so quick with support.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.020
Well, what do we do, Strategist?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.300
Naotsugu, straight line formation.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.270
Our enemies are PKs.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.800
I have visual contact on four.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.740
I'll determine their location.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.180
There!

07:32.780 --> 07:34.050
<i>Mind Bolt!</i>

07:35.660 --> 07:36.350
I see them.

07:36.350 --> 07:37.740
Enemy sighted.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.820
They have guts, turning to PKing.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.400
They miss their mommies so much, 
they turned into animals?

07:44.950 --> 07:46.390
<i>One dressed like a fighter,</i>

07:46.390 --> 07:47.780

they've read too much manga.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.850
<i>More importantly, they're human.</i>

08:00.270 --> 08:00.990
What do we do?

08:01.580 --> 08:03.020
Crush them!

08:03.020 --> 08:05.880
These guys attack people for fun!

08:06.230 --> 08:11.350
Obviously, if someone else kills 
them, they can't complain!

08:11.810 --> 08:15.260
I'm willing to give them the money.

08:16.970 --> 08:19.680
That is, if they can beat us.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.850
Well said, Shiro!

08:21.850 --> 08:22.920
You little...

08:23.310 --> 08:25.590
First target, the one in front, on the right.

08:25.590 --> 08:26.840
Draw the others' attention, too!

08:39.640 --> 08:42.560
<i>Astral Bind is only a basic root spell.</i>

<i>It just keeps the target from 
covering long distances,</i>

08:45.180 --> 08:46.570
<i>and it doesn't last long.</i>

08:47.930 --> 08:49.300
I'll take the mage.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.710
You get the warrior!

08:50.960 --> 08:52.290
Got it.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.860
<i>Good call.</i>

08:54.430 --> 08:55.180
<i>However,</i>

08:55.950 --> 08:58.600
<i>Naotsugu is a guardian.</i>

08:58.870 --> 09:01.600
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

09:01.870 --> 09:02.690
What?

09:04.320 --> 09:05.110
You...

09:07.200 --> 09:09.930
<i>A guardian belongs to a group called tanks,</i>

09:10.730 --> 09:14.040
<i>whose role is to protect their 
allies by intercepting attacks.</i>

09:15.090 --> 09:16.190
Anchor Howl...

09:16.700 --> 09:20.200
<i>Anyone affected by this skill 
becomes unable to ignore the user.</i>

09:20.730 --> 09:24.220
<i>The second they try, they're hit

Fine...

09:26.300 --> 09:28.290
We'll take him first!

09:28.630 --> 09:31.210
You won't break through my armor!

<i>But Naotsugu's HP won't last 
another thirty seconds...</i>

09:39.040 --> 09:40.310
<i>Electrical Fuzz!</i>

09:44.600 --> 09:45.740
He's an enchanter?

09:45.740 --> 09:47.080
What's that spell?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.560
It didn't hurt at all!

09:49.240 --> 09:51.440
<i>The enchanter...</i>

09:51.960 --> 09:54.010
<i>A magical attack class type.</i>

09:54.010 --> 09:55.570
<i>But its attack power is</i>

09:56.960 --> 09:58.070
<i>weak...</i>

10:00.210 --> 10:04.200
What were you trying to 
accomplish with that spell?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.210
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage!</i>

10:08.880 --> 10:10.240
What is this?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.130
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage...</i>

10:18.740 --> 10:21.850
<i>It wraps a caster's enemies in shining thorns.</i>

10:21.850 --> 10:24.180
<i>And for every hit an ally lands,</i>

10:24.880 --> 10:27.850
<i>the thorns explode, dealing 1,000 damage.</i>

10:28.470 --> 10:30.480
<i>Enchanters aren't offensively powerful.</i>

10:30.900 --> 10:33.490
<i>But they can weaken an enemy's attack,</i>

10:33.490 --> 10:35.490
<i>or strengthen their allies.</i>

10:36.070 --> 10:40.490
When all five thorns explode, 
you'll lose half your HP.

10:40.490 --> 10:41.500
Calm down.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.520
We need to heal...

10:42.520 --> 10:43.410
Healer!

10:43.990 --> 10:45.440
<i>On its own, the class is helpless,</i>

10:45.950 --> 10:48.570
<i>and can't do much without a party.</i>

10:48.990 --> 10:51.060
<i>But I like it.</i>

10:51.910 --> 10:53.800
Your back's totally exposed!

10:54.900 --> 10:57.300
We'll win because we have 
a healer and you don't!

10:57.300 --> 11:01.090
Have fun crying in the Cathedral—

11:03.720 --> 11:04.230
Wha—

11:04.890 --> 11:06.500
What are you doing, healer?

11:07.430 --> 11:08.230
Hey!

11:08.900 --> 11:11.530
I've put your healer to sleep.

11:11.980 --> 11:15.230
Of course, they've been asleep the entire time.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.520
<i>Astral Hypnos...</i>

11:17.520 --> 11:20.740
<i>A spell that puts the target to sleep.</i>

11:20.740 --> 11:22.230
I'll take you out first, after all!

11:22.230 --> 11:23.740
Wait, not yet!

11:24.360 --> 11:26.510
Anchor Howl hasn't worn off yet!

11:26.510 --> 11:27.120
Cra—

11:29.740 --> 11:30.650
Fine!

11:30.650 --> 11:32.310
Sorcerer! Summoner!

11:32.310 --> 11:33.630
We'll use everything we have!

11:34.030 --> 11:36.350
Blast them to ash!

11:40.960 --> 11:43.140
<i>Assassin...</i>

11:43.800 --> 11:47.930
<i>This class specializes in quick 
elimination of the enemy.</i>

11:49.120 --> 11:52.560
<i>Naotsugu was targeted by a bind-type 
movement-restriction spell.</i>

11:53.060 --> 11:55.770
<i>But I didn't notice any mages.</i>

11:56.860 --> 12:00.790
<i>When I said I had visual contact on four,</i>

12:01.490 --> 12:03.720
<i>Akatsuki understood what I meant,</i>

12:03.720 --> 12:07.430
<i>and acted quickly to remove the 
ambushers hiding in the forest.</i>

12:08.590 --> 12:11.790
Insulting my lord's magic isn't wise.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.710
You laughed at those small electric bursts,

12:15.710 --> 12:20.090
but those bright lights kept you 
from seeing in the dark forest.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.760
You never realized your healer was asleep.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.080
Your teamwork is full of openings.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.580
You were too focused on the battle 
to even watch your own HP,

12:30.580 --> 12:33.980
or keep an eye on the rest of the party's status.

12:34.330 --> 12:35.740
Taking out your ambushers was easy.

12:35.740 --> 12:38.910
Shut up! Defeating us won't do any good!

12:38.910 --> 12:40.520
We'll just revive in the Cathedral...

12:40.520 --> 12:41.460
Want to try it?

12:43.810 --> 12:45.160
I'm sorry!

12:45.160 --> 12:47.620
I won't do it again! Please forgive me!

12:47.940 --> 12:49.560
Please!

12:50.310 --> 12:53.710
You actually thought I'd say that, you—

13:08.330 --> 13:11.290
Security really is getting bad.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.910
It's not like PKing is good for much profit.

13:14.910 --> 13:17.990
I can understand people being freaked out.

13:17.990 --> 13:21.480
But there are other things they 
could do with their time.

13:21.660 --> 13:22.540
Like what?

13:22.890 --> 13:23.990
Boobs—

13:24.950 --> 13:28.490
My lord, may I knee this pervert in the face?

13:28.490 --> 13:31.470
Ask before you do it! And while you're 
at it, let me finish my sentence!

13:31.470 --> 13:33.760
You were going to say something else perverted.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.000
I was, but...

13:36.020 --> 13:37.360
Other things to do?

13:38.330 --> 13:39.720
You're probably right...

13:40.310 --> 13:41.750
There's nothing to do.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.260
No goal to live for.

13:45.430 --> 13:47.760
Taste aside, we have food.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.300
By defeating low-level monsters, 
you can make money.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.440
With that money, you can stay at an inn.

13:54.270 --> 13:58.480
Fighting isn't allowed in towns, so you 
don't have to fear for your life there.

13:59.620 --> 14:02.110
And even if you do die, you'll come back to life.

14:02.770 --> 14:07.020
So you can survive in this world 
without doing anything?

14:07.020 --> 14:09.780
But can you really call that living?

14:10.370 --> 14:11.870
Or is just not being dead?

14:12.500 --> 14:16.370
So they've resorted to PKing 
because there's nothing else to do?

14:16.710 --> 14:20.560
They need something beyond staying 
alive to occupy their minds.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.640
And they're getting it by hurting others?

14:24.640 --> 14:25.470
Unbelievable.

14:25.860 --> 14:28.300
Yeah, it's pretty pathetic.

14:29.030 --> 14:29.810
But...

14:30.890 --> 14:33.010
<i>I'm not doing anything, either.</i>

14:34.440 --> 14:35.220
My lord?

14:36.880 --> 14:40.680
Oh, but I don't really think 
things are getting worse.

14:41.570 --> 14:42.970
It just seems that way

14:42.970 --> 14:47.960
because everyone still thinks of this as 
the same <i>Elder Tale</i> world they knew.

14:48.950 --> 14:53.180
If it isn't that world, then security 
was an illusion from the start.

14:55.620 --> 14:56.600
My lord...

14:58.460 --> 14:59.220
Yes?

15:02.410 --> 15:04.120
You're going to Susukino?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.860
On the day of the Apocalypse,

15:05.860 --> 15:08.790
one of our members was going to Susukino.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.090
A girl called Serara...

15:11.090 --> 15:12.300
You're going to find her?

15:12.630 --> 15:15.560
The transport gates still aren't working, right?

15:16.070 --> 15:19.310
Using fairy rings would be 
the only other way there.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.520
Yes, but...

15:20.520 --> 15:21.790
Indeed.

15:21.790 --> 15:25.160
Since we can't look up any online 
timetables in a walkthrough,

15:25.160 --> 15:28.610
using them is dangerous because we 
can't be sure where we'll end up.

15:29.270 --> 15:32.620
There's also the return spell, Call of Home, right?

15:32.970 --> 15:36.350
You can return to the last of the five 
Great Cities you visited... Wait.

15:37.460 --> 15:40.250
The last one she visited was Susukino.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.250
Yeah.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.970
The only methods left are walking or by horse.

15:45.580 --> 15:49.170
In the real world, there are 850 km 
between Tokyo and Sapporo.

15:49.840 --> 15:54.070
The <i>Elder Tale</i> world uses the Half Gaia Project,

15:54.070 --> 15:55.800
so it would be 425 km.

15:56.700 --> 16:00.270
And during that time, you'd have 
to fight monsters, of course.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.930
Why send help now?

16:05.380 --> 16:06.180
Well...

16:06.180 --> 16:08.940
W-We've been planning to send 
a rescue team for a while...

16:09.310 --> 16:10.490
Marie...

16:11.210 --> 16:13.190
D-Don't look at me that way.

16:13.190 --> 16:15.600
You look really mean...

16:15.600 --> 16:17.290
If you do that, girls won't like you!

16:22.040 --> 16:26.600
Things in Susukino are worse 
than they are here.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.420
Marie?

16:27.770 --> 16:32.200
Some nasty players attacked Serara.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.260
She was lucky to be saved by a nice player.

16:38.350 --> 16:41.140
Now they're protecting her.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.900
And so, we were going to take our 
highest-level players to Susukino.

16:46.510 --> 16:51.530
And I wanted to ask if you'd take care of 
the rest of the guild while we're away.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.900
Please.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.270
Please... I beg you.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.260
<i>Twenty-one days is probably the fastest 
you can make it to Susukino.</i>

17:01.890 --> 17:03.300
<i>Over a month, round trip.</i>

17:04.060 --> 17:05.840
<i>The Crescent Moon Alliance's 
highest-level members?</i>

17:06.730 --> 17:09.280
<i>In </i>Elder Tale<i>, the maximum party size is six.</i>

17:10.370 --> 17:12.280
<i>If they had a good healer...</i>

17:13.090 --> 17:17.490
<i>No, their journey is going to fail.</i>

17:18.160 --> 17:20.190
<i>What's the best option, then?</i>

17:23.310 --> 17:26.450
<i>We... We should go.</i>

17:28.280 --> 17:31.600
<i>But I have no right to involve myself</i>

17:32.240 --> 17:33.830
<i>in someone else's guild.</i>

17:34.510 --> 17:37.770
<i>And they wouldn't want that, anyway.</i>

17:39.800 --> 17:41.870
<i>But... Even so...</i>

17:42.750 --> 17:44.790
<i>Even so, I...</i>

17:47.900 --> 17:49.180
Say it, Shiro.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.130
Your turn to speak, my lord.

17:57.970 --> 17:59.280
We will go.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.810
The best option is for us to go.

18:07.540 --> 18:12.720
<b>Ueno Thieves' Realm

18:09.440 --> 18:12.730
Shiroe, Naotsugu, Akatsuki...

18:13.070 --> 18:15.170
Please save Serara.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.740
Leave it to us, and to my lord.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.240
A ninja does not know the word "failure."

18:23.700 --> 18:25.250
<i>Just like in the game,</i>

18:25.720 --> 18:28.370
<i>we were able to use items to summon horses.</i>

18:34.680 --> 18:37.390
Where do you suppose these 
horses come from, anyway?

18:39.390 --> 18:42.140
<i>Our bodies knew how to ride them, too.</i>

18:45.290 --> 18:48.080
It's nice that the movement is automatic,

18:48.080 --> 18:50.130
but it still hurts my butt...

18:50.130 --> 18:51.170
Does it?

18:52.620 --> 18:54.550
That's a really nice map.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.110
My subclass is scribe.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.300
I made a copy of the maps at the archives.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.470
I see... Nice job, my lord.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.410
Well? Where are we?

19:05.410 --> 19:06.620
Most likely...

19:06.860 --> 19:09.420
Seriously? I can't tell at all.

19:09.420 --> 19:12.000
Oh, well... We'll make better 
time in the afternoon.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.520
Roger.

19:16.540 --> 19:19.740
I just wish they could do 
something about the food...

19:21.140 --> 19:22.300
We'll go.

19:24.570 --> 19:26.550
If someone you know is crying, you help.

19:27.410 --> 19:28.950
There's nothing unusual about that.

19:28.950 --> 19:29.820
Yes.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.610
Even if we have nothing to do,

19:31.610 --> 19:34.150
that's no reason for us to be pathetic, too.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.780
You're right.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.280
<i>This is my... It's our answer.</i>

19:40.890 --> 19:42.160
<i>What we can do.</i>

19:42.420 --> 19:44.900
Or is that too cool for us?

19:44.900 --> 19:47.080
No, but...

19:48.640 --> 19:50.540
<i>But that's how cool it was...</i>

19:51.890 --> 19:55.120
<i>Our old place, the Debauchery Tea Party.</i>

19:56.420 --> 19:57.960
Now, then...

19:59.160 --> 20:00.060
Wait.

20:01.340 --> 20:03.240
What is that, my lord?

20:19.830 --> 20:21.450
Those are griffons.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.480
Well, yeah.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.740
You didn't think we were going to 
get to the far north on horses, did you?

20:31.060 --> 20:33.790
But these monsters...

20:31.730 --> 20:33.230
Hand.

20:34.370 --> 20:36.820
Wait... W-We're riding them?

20:34.980 --> 20:35.960
Good!

20:36.820 --> 20:38.130
We are, Miss Akatsuki.

20:37.290 --> 20:39.160
Hey! Stop that!

20:39.160 --> 20:40.630
It's Akatsuki.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.070
A-Akatsuki... You'll ride behind me.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.120
Okay?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.440
All right.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.140
However...

20:49.560 --> 20:53.140
I've heard of summon flutes like those.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.410
That they're only given to players

20:56.410 --> 21:00.650
who've won the Hades Breath 
raid on the Fields of Death.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.830
Yeah, a long time ago...

21:02.830 --> 21:05.160
It's a great trick to surprise people with!

21:07.580 --> 21:09.000
Hop on, Akatsuki.

21:25.210 --> 21:26.470
All set?

21:26.470 --> 21:28.680
Yes, my lord, no problem...

21:29.230 --> 21:31.040
Okay, hang on tight.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.180
Wait, don't grab my stomach...

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
I'll go first!

21:40.670 --> 21:42.260
Yahoo!

21:42.840 --> 21:43.670
Jeez.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.480
Ready, Akatsuki?

21:45.480 --> 21:47.200
Then, we'll get going, too.

21:54.390 --> 21:55.770
It's a great view.

22:06.110 --> 22:07.000
Are you okay?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.760
Yeah.

22:11.300 --> 22:14.180
My lord... This is amazing!

22:14.860 --> 22:18.250
It's like we're floating in the sky!

22:19.150 --> 22:20.890
Isn't this great?

22:20.890 --> 22:23.940
It's amazing... This is amazing!

22:24.570 --> 22:28.020
The sky is so blue and clear!

24:05.450 --> 24:08.800
Shiroe's party heads toward Susukino, 
through the underground labyrinth.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.610
Awaiting them are phantoms of the past

24:11.610 --> 24:14.000
and a horde of rat-men.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.030
When Shiroe was a solo player, 
he once had friends he held very dear.

24:18.030 --> 24:21.940
They were called the Debauchery Tea Party.

24:22.270 --> 24:29.990
<b>The Depths of Palm</b>

24:22.590 --> 24:24.820
Next time: The Depths of Palm.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.180
This is our reality.
