00:39.040 --> 00:44.558
# Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky #

00:45.520 --> 00:47.636
# Nice work if you can get it #

00:47.720 --> 00:50.598
# And you can get it
if you try #

00:51.640 --> 00:57.192
# Strollin' with that one girl,
sighin' sigh after sigh #

00:57.280 --> 00:59.999
# Nice work if you can get it #

01:00.080 --> 01:03.755
# And you can get it
if you try #

01:03.840 --> 01:09.756
# Just imagine someone
waitin' at the cottage door #

01:09.840 --> 01:11.751
# Where two hearts become one #

01:11.840 --> 01:15.037
- # Who could ask
for anything more? #
- Mmm!

01:15.120 --> 01:16.269
That looks good enough to eat.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.918
Oh, thank you.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.797
I wasn't talking about the cake.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.440
Oh, Gordon. You're my cousin.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.317
Never stopped
the Royal Family.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.515
You're a very sick man.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.875
Mm. Hi.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.439
- Hi.
- You're yummy.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.557
Oh, Mum, would you take Grandma
over to the church, please?

01:33.640 --> 01:35.198
Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.599
So, do you wanna go and
tell Dennis that we're ready?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.272
Sure thing.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.315
How's he doing?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.038
Oh, great. Thrilled.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.470
I'm telling you, he's thrilled.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.236
Dennis, it's Gordon.
Are you ready?

01:57.520 --> 02:00.717
Wow! You look great!

02:03.080 --> 02:04.354
So, are you ready?

02:04.440 --> 02:05.509
Um...

02:07.160 --> 02:08.513
- Just...
- OK.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.830
I'm gonna give you a minute
to, uh...

02:10.919 --> 02:11.955
give you a minute.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.668
No, no. I don't want to.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.671
Done want to, ah...

02:26.880 --> 02:27.915
Dennis!

02:28.000 --> 02:30.468
It's time.
Dennis, we have to go.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.389
Dennis!

02:33.440 --> 02:34.475
Dennis!

02:37.680 --> 02:40.319
# Where to promise
to love one... #

02:41.480 --> 02:43.755
Dennis, we're gonna have a baby.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.595
Dennis.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.275
Dennis?

02:50.840 --> 02:54.992
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

03:02.400 --> 03:03.833
Aw, shit.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.274
Dennis!

03:13.840 --> 03:15.239
Dennis!

03:16.480 --> 03:18.789
# I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
if you're gettin' me wrong #

03:18.880 --> 03:21.440
# But you're half a world away
with only one sock on #

03:21.520 --> 03:24.318
# Now you're gettin' too much,
I don't want to play along #

03:24.400 --> 03:27.073
# 'Cause all I really wanted
was a radio song #

03:27.160 --> 03:28.673
# What is there to say #

03:28.760 --> 03:29.749
# What is there to say?

03:29.840 --> 03:31.068
# In a world so grey? #

03:31.160 --> 03:32.149
# In a world so grey #

03:32.240 --> 03:36.597
# Why, oh, why, oh, why
are we singing it anyway? #

03:37.840 --> 03:38.795
- Come on!
- # 'Cause you think I had #

03:38.880 --> 03:40.552
- # A wind-up heart #
- Stop!

03:40.640 --> 03:43.200
- # Then you must
have had plastic head #
- Come back!

03:43.280 --> 03:45.271
- # Did you think
I had to play the part? #
- Give me a break!

03:45.360 --> 03:48.113
# When you copied everything
I said? #

03:48.200 --> 03:50.668
- # When the tide of love is out
and the rust begins to show #
- Whoo!

03:50.760 --> 03:51.988
# You're cryin'
in your sleep #

03:52.080 --> 03:53.069
# Scared of your shadow #

03:53.160 --> 03:54.309
- # If you thought
this was forever #
- Ooh!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.356
- Oh!
- # Dear,
I'm keeping you in mind #

03:56.440 --> 03:57.475
Gotcha. Where is it?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.515
Where's what?

03:58.600 --> 03:59.555
You know what I'm talkin' about!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.755
Ooh! Hey! Hey!

04:00.840 --> 04:01.795
Ooh!

04:01.880 --> 04:02.835
All right!

04:02.920 --> 04:03.875
What do you
think this is, huh?

04:03.960 --> 04:05.154
I've never seen those
before in my life.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.071
Yeah, and you're
a fit, running type.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.149
You bastard.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.195
Don't.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.269
Little shit!

04:10.360 --> 04:11.475
There's nothing to see here,
people.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.595
Ow!

04:20.640 --> 04:21.595
Where's the bra?

04:21.680 --> 04:22.715
What bra?

04:24.600 --> 04:25.669
Whoo!

04:25.760 --> 04:27.591
Come on, fat boy, run!

04:27.680 --> 04:28.829
I'm not fat!

04:28.920 --> 04:30.512
I'm just... I'm unfit.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.915
Go on, then.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.315
Ow!

05:11.240 --> 05:12.468
Yes?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.437
Could you let me in, please,
Mr G?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.115
Who the hell are you?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.156
You... Why are we...

05:20.240 --> 05:22.276
It's Dennis Doyle
from downstairs.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.191
Dennis Doyle from downstairs
is dead...

05:24.280 --> 05:25.349
killed by his landlord.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.634
- Do you know why?
- No.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.678
Failure to pay the rent
in a timely fashion.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.829
Dennis!

05:30.920 --> 05:32.399
Hey, Maya.
Listen, can you tell your dad...

05:32.480 --> 05:33.435
I'm in a bit of a hurry?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.431
- Have you got any money?
- Maya, go inside!

05:37.840 --> 05:39.239
And put something on.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.068
Hello. Hello.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.912
Yes?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.035
Do you know what happened
to that landlord...

05:45.120 --> 05:47.111
after he killed Dennis Doyle
from downstairs?

05:47.200 --> 05:49.236
- No.
- They gave him a medal...

05:49.320 --> 05:52.073
and a nice foot massage.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.551
Hey, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.870
Mr Ghoshdashtidar, wait...

06:10.640 --> 06:12.756
Well, how is the old rascal?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.832
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.035
You know Bilbo.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.519
He's got
the whole place in an uproar.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.192
Mm. Ah, well,
that should please him.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.115
Jake, your dad's gonna be here
in a minute.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.315
You ready?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.879
Ready!

06:26.960 --> 06:29.235
All right,
then keep your secrets.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.958
Hey.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.758
- # You give me tone #
- Hey.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.831
# I'll like that #

06:36.920 --> 06:38.592
Hey, how is it goin'?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.511
- Oh, yeah.
- # All the chrome #

06:40.600 --> 06:42.556
# Well, I'll like that #

06:42.640 --> 06:44.949
Dennis. Yeah, Dennis.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.155
# Do you run away? #

06:46.240 --> 06:48.629
You like, uh, to have some sort
of drink with me?

06:48.720 --> 06:50.039
Oh, what the hell. Let's...

06:53.360 --> 06:54.395
Ow, shit!

06:54.480 --> 06:55.674
Oh!

06:55.760 --> 06:57.079
- Hah!
- Aah!

06:57.160 --> 06:58.752
No. Oh, you got me!

06:59.760 --> 07:00.909
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.194
- We're playing
hobbits and orcs.
- Mm-hmm.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.429
Guess who's an orc?

07:04.960 --> 07:06.439
Honey, would you mind, uh...

07:06.520 --> 07:08.511
This kind of smarts. Can you?

07:08.600 --> 07:09.635
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.869
I'm not finished
with you, Whit!

07:10.960 --> 07:12.359
Yeah, one sec.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.714
Uh, I thought his dad
was picking him up.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.791
- What happened?
- Oh, what happened?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.949
Dennis happened.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.951
Mmm. Well, on the bright side...

07:19.040 --> 07:21.315
- Hmm?
- You look astonishingly
beautiful today.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.435
- Whit!
- Really.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.555
Where have you been?

07:29.640 --> 07:30.993
Hey.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.115
- I was...
- Daddy!

07:32.200 --> 07:33.872
Hey, snot-face!

07:33.960 --> 07:35.234
Oh, please, don't call him that.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.673
Why?
He is a snot-face, isn't he?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.478
You are a snot-face,
aren't you? Huh?

07:38.560 --> 07:39.709
Oh.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.755
Aw!

07:40.840 --> 07:42.353
Jake, that's disgusting.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.793
Jake, that's disgusting.
Go on.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.479
- Toilet first.
- Mom!

07:46.560 --> 07:48.869
Go on. Grab your jacket.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.676
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago, Dennis.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.193
Yeah, there was a bit
of a mix-up with the...

07:54.280 --> 07:55.838
with the tickets, so...

07:55.920 --> 07:57.035
Hey, you look really nice.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.189
Did I get you that necklace?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.350
No. It was a...

08:00.440 --> 08:02.635
just a present
from someone... else.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.836
- Who?
- Uh, me, actually.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.875
Oh, yeah.

08:05.960 --> 08:06.915
Huh?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.558
It belonged to my grandmother.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.675
Yeah.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.475
Huh?

08:12.480 --> 08:14.994
Dennis, this is
my good friend, Whit.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.072
Whit, this is my...
Jake's dad, Dennis.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.434
How you doin'?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.719
Good, yeah.
You have soft hands.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.949
Do you moisturize?

08:23.880 --> 08:24.915
I do, actually.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.715
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.631
It's nice to finally put a face
to the name.

08:29.720 --> 08:30.675
I'd have probably thought
you'd have...

08:30.760 --> 08:32.193
you would have seen
one of our photos.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.195
Oh, there aren't any.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.875
- Hmm.
- Ready?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.837
Yes. Let's go.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.114
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.033
Dennis, you do have
the tickets, right?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.759
Libby, credit me
with some intelligence.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.229
Tickets!

08:51.320 --> 08:53.311
Does anybody have any tickets?

08:53.400 --> 08:54.674
Mate, my daughter's
not very well.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.988
I've got a couple of
spare tickets if you want 'em.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.513
Yes. Thank you so much.
How much?

08:57.600 --> 08:58.635
Oh, whatever.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.119
Uh, this is
all the money I have.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.515
Yeah?

09:02.600 --> 09:03.828
My son is gonna love me.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.797
You want your son to love you?
Don't break the law.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.711
Hey, that's entrapment!

09:07.800 --> 09:09.358
Oh, God!

09:09.440 --> 09:11.078
And that's brutality!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.876
Libby, it's...
It was only a caution.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.032
No. Uh, Libby, I'll...

09:19.120 --> 09:20.155
- Bye, Dad.
- Libby.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.239
So, do you work with Libby
at the bakery?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.595
No.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.588
We met at the bakery, though.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.113
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.195
What?

09:42.280 --> 09:44.555
No, I just was
a nervous wreck that day.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.834
It took me
four chocolate eclairs...

09:45.920 --> 09:48.559
and a macaroon just to get up
the courage to talk to her.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.679
Uh, no, I work in
the financial district actually.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.835
I'm a hedge fund manager
for Waterman Hughes.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.148
Oh.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.435
I do high-level security
analysis and operation...

10:00.520 --> 10:01.839
for an upscale retail outlet.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.273
Really?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.078
Libby said
you were a security guard...

10:05.160 --> 10:06.309
at a women's clothing store.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.992
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.479
Right.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.630
Uh, well, l...
I should probably get a cab.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.312
I got a big run in the morning.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.833
A big what?

10:15.920 --> 10:18.673
A run... I'm training for
the Nike River Run next month.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.715
The what-y what what?

10:19.800 --> 10:20.994
The Nike River Run.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.674
It's a... It's a marathon race
along the, uh, Thames River.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.039
Why would you do that?

10:26.120 --> 10:27.872
Uh, well, it's
a charity thing, you know?

10:27.960 --> 10:28.915
Plus, I love to run.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.594
I actually ran the London
Marathon a little while ago.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.635
Oh, that's a coincidence.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.675
Oh, yeah? How's that?

10:33.760 --> 10:35.159
I watched it on the television.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.275
- Ah.
- Well, the last hour.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.952
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

10:39.160 --> 10:40.388
Right.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.710
Um, well, look, you know...

10:42.800 --> 10:44.791
I know these things can be
pretty awkward, you know?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.359
I mean, you know,
you're Jake's dad...

10:46.440 --> 10:49.671
and, uh, well,
I just want you to know...

10:49.760 --> 10:55.357
that I like Libby and Jake
very, very much...

10:55.440 --> 10:59.353
and, um, well, I just appreciate
your being so grown up...

10:59.440 --> 11:00.589
about this, you know?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.189
Hey! Yo!

11:02.280 --> 11:03.474
You wanna take this one?

11:03.560 --> 11:04.675
- No, you have it.
- You sure?

11:04.760 --> 11:05.954
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.439
All right.
Very nice to meet you.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.033
- Yeah.
- I'm sure I'll see you around.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.872
Yup. Hope so.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.679
Hello, good sir.
West India Quay, please.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.035
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.553
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.315
Dennis!

11:49.320 --> 11:50.355
Dennis!

11:53.360 --> 11:54.395
Dennis?

11:56.240 --> 11:57.195
- Close your eyes.
- Huh?

11:57.280 --> 11:58.713
- Close your eyes.
- Oh.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.716
OK. Open them.
Happy Valentine's.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.198
That's great.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.675
Dennis!

12:38.280 --> 12:39.349
Dennis!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.075
Hi.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.235
Hey, Vincent.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.993
- Dennis.
- How's business?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.069
Whatcha mean, "business"?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.229
Sorry.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.675
- Got it.
- Shh.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.749
Hush now, man.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.068
All right.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.309
Three thousand.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.754
This is all I've got.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.351
Just throw whatever you have
in the pot.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.396
OK.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.595
Flush, king high.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.669
Ace high.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.873
What happened?

14:23.840 --> 14:24.795
Bad luck, mate.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.154
Oh.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.792
Oh, hey, I got you
those tickets.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.233
They were for yesterday.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.275
What?
So now you don't want 'em?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.759
Why would I want them?

14:34.720 --> 14:35.675
Put them on eBay.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.909
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

14:37.000 --> 14:38.274
for something
that happened yesterday?

14:38.360 --> 14:39.873
- Time travellers.
- Where were you?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.076
My whole night
was just screwed, man...

14:42.160 --> 14:45.072
and I looked like a prick in
front of Libby's new boyfriend.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.878
Oh, she didn't tell me
she has a new boyfriend.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.075
What's he like?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.678
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.672
He's like Peter Perfect
out of Wacky Races...

14:53.760 --> 14:54.988
and he runs marathons.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.799
- Why?
- Exactly.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.672
Well, look, my only
serious relationship ended...

15:04.760 --> 15:07.035
in a broken collarbone
and a dead meerkat...

15:07.120 --> 15:08.997
so I may not be the best person
in the world to give advice...

15:09.080 --> 15:11.514
but you have been trying
to get through to Libby...

15:11.600 --> 15:13.318
for five years now...

15:13.400 --> 15:15.914
so maybe you should let her go.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.558
Yeah,
but what is her problem?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.199
Dennis, you left her
at the altar...

15:20.280 --> 15:21.429
when she was pregnant.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.839
But that was ages ago.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.753
Well, women remember that stuff.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.233
Look, if there's anything else
I can do to help...

15:29.320 --> 15:30.992
just let me know.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.071
Well, actually, I am
a little bit behind in my rent.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.639
I was wondering if you had
a couple of hundred quid...

15:34.720 --> 15:36.153
I could maybe borrow.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.915
Oh, I love you. I really do.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.797
I needed that actually.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.996
That's great. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.075
How about this one?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.075
I bet you can't do it.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.992
- I can do a big one.
- Go on.

16:08.920 --> 16:09.955
Look, look, look, look, look.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.154
That was a good one.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.275
Yeah.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.994
Listen.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.230
I'm really sorry about
gettin' you arrested yesterday.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.275
That's all right.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.588
Most universities
don't even look...

16:22.680 --> 16:23.999
at things
like that these days.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.234
Hey, another one.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.958
As far as I'm concerned,
what else do you have?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.598
- Oh, she was great.
- Yeah, well, she is...

16:29.680 --> 16:30.954
Ooh!

16:31.880 --> 16:33.108
- Shh.
- Sorry.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.155
Um, but, yeah, so I think...

16:34.240 --> 16:35.753
Do you want to hear a secret?

16:35.840 --> 16:36.795
Absolutely.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.598
There's a girl in my class
called Emily.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.398
Well, I'm sure
that's not a secret.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.959
The teachers probably know
about her.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.234
She looks like a tree frog.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.275
She what?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.839
She looks like a tree frog.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.751
That's not
a very nice thing to say.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.114
I like tree frogs.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.269
Oh, yeah?

16:50.360 --> 16:51.395
More than hobbits?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.914
I see.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.150
I really feel
we can make a life together.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.468
"You really think we could..."

16:58.560 --> 17:00.391
Wait, that sounds like something
Whit would say.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.754
He did say it.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.876
- What? To Mom?
- Yes.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.108
What a shithead.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.155
Dad!

17:06.240 --> 17:07.275
Sorry.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.032
Listen, I'm really glad
you were such a big boy...

17:11.119 --> 17:12.439
about not gettin'
into the whole...

17:12.520 --> 17:13.669
Lord of the Rings thing,
you know?

17:13.760 --> 17:14.714
That's OK.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.199
Whit's got us front row seats
for tomorrow...

17:16.280 --> 17:17.348
so it's even better.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.873
What a shithead.

17:18.960 --> 17:19.994
Dad!

17:20.359 --> 17:21.395
Well.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.315
# Ah, yeah #

17:31.280 --> 17:32.315
# Oh, yeah #

17:34.640 --> 17:36.153
# I'm up
on the eleventh floor #

17:36.240 --> 17:38.674
# And I'm watchin'
the cruisers below #

17:41.320 --> 17:42.639
# He's down on the street #

17:42.720 --> 17:45.359
# And he's tryin' hard
to pull sister Flo #

17:47.760 --> 17:49.637
# Oh, my heart's
in the basement #

17:49.720 --> 17:52.314
# My weekend's
at an all-time low #

17:54.480 --> 17:56.072
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

17:56.160 --> 17:58.549
# So I can't see her
letting him go #

18:00.320 --> 18:01.912
# You betcha #

18:02.000 --> 18:03.319
# Oh, yeah #

18:04.400 --> 18:05.435
# Uh-huh #

18:11.800 --> 18:12.789
Deliveries are downstairs.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.552
- No, I'm...
- Waterman Hughes.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.513
- Yes?
- Bonjour.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.309
Whit!

18:28.280 --> 18:29.315
Thanks for your help.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.918
So, what brings you
down here, man?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.070
A little, uh, high-level
security analysis...

18:34.160 --> 18:35.388
in retail operation?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.549
Huh?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.471
What can I do for you?
I'm just on my way to the gym.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.835
- I got a spin class.
- Huh?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.036
Spinning?
You know, spinning, bicycles?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.075
Oh, OK.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.151
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a pint.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.958
A pint? Oh, a pint.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.837
Uh, wow.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.638
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

18:51.720 --> 18:53.119
but, uh, I really gotta hit
this class.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.633
I'm in training, you know?

18:54.720 --> 18:55.948
You wanna come along?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.632
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.676
L... I'd love to, but I don't
have any gear, so...

18:59.760 --> 19:00.829
Well, I'll lend you some.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.915
Great.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.831
Three, two, one!

19:04.920 --> 19:06.399
We're climbing!
Rhythm is up!

19:06.480 --> 19:10.359
Push! Push! Push! Push!

19:10.440 --> 19:11.873
Keep it up!

19:11.960 --> 19:13.632
No cheating! Let's go!

19:13.720 --> 19:15.039
How you doin' there?
You all right?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.075
What'd you say?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.151
Out of the saddle!
We're climbing!

19:20.080 --> 19:21.832
OK,
let's make it really hard!

19:23.760 --> 19:25.352
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about, man?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.268
Ow!

19:30.600 --> 19:32.670
Jake said you had some tickets
to the, uh...

19:32.760 --> 19:34.273
to the hobbit musical.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.078
Yeah, a friend of mine's
an investor in the show.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.071
He totally hooked me up.
Can you believe that?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.799
Hmm... um...

19:40.880 --> 19:42.871
I was just thinking, um...

19:42.960 --> 19:43.915
you know,
you don't really wanna sit...

19:44.000 --> 19:46.992
through a whole sort of
three-hour kind of show, do you?

19:47.080 --> 19:50.152
- So...
- Well, the thing is...

19:50.880 --> 19:51.915
Oh.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.995
Jake's really kind of got
his heart set on this, you know?

19:55.080 --> 19:56.115
Yeah.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.279
- Powder?
- I'm fine.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.509
You sure? Refreshing.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.192
I would imagine it is.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.238
I was just... I'm thinkin' maybe,
you know, if you like...

20:04.320 --> 20:06.880
then I could maybe take Jake
and Libby for you, you know...

20:06.960 --> 20:08.996
if... if you want.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.958
Look, I know you must be
kind of angry at yourself...

20:12.040 --> 20:13.871
for messing up with the tickets
the other night...

20:13.960 --> 20:15.359
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.192
I really would, but, um...

20:18.560 --> 20:19.595
Well, the thing is...

20:19.680 --> 20:22.148
I hope to be more and more
a part of Jake's life, you know?

20:22.240 --> 20:25.596
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind
of looking forward to this show.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.035
Give Jake and I, a chance to get
to know each other better.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.429
I mean, uh, you can see
my point, can't you?

20:31.400 --> 20:32.469
Yes, I can.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.033
So, can I ask you a question?

20:36.120 --> 20:37.189
Sure.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.396
You had her once,
why did you ever let her go?

20:39.840 --> 20:40.795
To be honest, Whit...

20:40.880 --> 20:42.757
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just
be careful on the stairs here.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.193
Your legs
might be a little rubbery.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.075
I'm fine.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.918
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.194
I'm fine. I'm...

20:52.280 --> 20:54.271
Yeah, the first step
is often the, uh...

20:54.360 --> 20:55.395
the difficult one.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.798
This is Libby.
Leave me a message.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.916
Hey, Lib, it's me.
Can you give me a ring?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.755
Fuck!

21:18.560 --> 21:19.675
Who the hell are you?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.318
Just open the bloody door.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.549
OK.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.396
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.311
- Forty-eight.
- Yes.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.435
Hello.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.953
Dennis, I'm really busy.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.075
Can we talk?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.196
No, just buy something or go.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.829
OK. I, can I have one of your
signature cupcakes, please?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.393
Actually,
can I have this big one?

22:22.480 --> 22:23.435
- Dennis.
- That one's fine...

22:23.520 --> 22:25.238
and, uh, I like that one, too.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.312
- Anything else?
- Um, yeah.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.879
What do you see in Whit?

22:29.960 --> 22:32.520
- Uh, forty-nine.
- Yes, I'm forty-nine.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.352
- What can I get for you?
- No, I'm not done yet.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.555
Yes, you are.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.756
Sorry, I think you've used up
your allotted time.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.434
You don't... You don't have
allotted time, OK?

22:40.520 --> 22:42.078
Now you're using up
my allotted time.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.752
You don't get
allotted time, OK?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.034
It's not like a game show,
you know?

22:45.120 --> 22:47.509
You got, like, fifteen seconds
to win a bun.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.272
Goodbye, Dennis.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.315
Yes?

22:50.400 --> 22:52.311
Yes. Hello, yes.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.676
Um, do you have any of those
little gingerbread rabbits?

22:55.760 --> 22:57.034
Oh, no.
We just have those at Easter.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.189
I'm so sorry.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.315
Oh.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.628
Hmm...

23:05.920 --> 23:08.832
Do you have anything else
shaped like an animal?

23:08.920 --> 23:09.875
- Excuse me.
- What?

23:09.960 --> 23:11.871
I haven't paid for my order.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.429
I'm sorry.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.475
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.959
Excuse me.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.994
- Ow!
- Sorry.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.919
Seriously,
what do you see in him?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.718
OK, he's well-off, all right?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.313
He's kind of... He's quite
good-looking, you know?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.355
But I mean, so what?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.919
Is that what you think
this is about?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.911
I just want
some gorgeous sugar daddy.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.194
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.474
Well,
that's not why I'm with him.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.675
Well, why are you with him?

23:33.760 --> 23:34.829
You know,
give me one good reason.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.797
One? I could give you fifty.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.030
- I'm fifty!
- Hang on a minute!

23:39.120 --> 23:42.351
He's mature, responsible,
considerate...

23:42.440 --> 23:43.668
he's great with Jake.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.637
- That's only four.
- Hello?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.188
You know what?
He's a good man, Dennis.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.748
You know, he runs marathons
for charity, for Pete's sake.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.273
Oh, big deal!

23:52.360 --> 23:54.112
So you could run a marathon?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.316
Could I have
a chocolate brownie, please?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.719
- Hang on!
- Oh!

23:57.800 --> 23:59.472
Look, Libby, I can change.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.949
Yeah? Well, great.
Let's get married.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.439
- Really?
- No!

24:03.520 --> 24:05.431
We tried that once, remember?

24:05.520 --> 24:07.829
You left me at the altar,
pregnant.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.319
You cock!

24:10.080 --> 24:11.513
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.477
I have changed. I can prove it.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.913
How?

24:16.720 --> 24:19.632
I'll tell you.
I will run the marathon.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.753
What?

24:22.840 --> 24:23.795
The one that Whit's doin'...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.711
I'll run that,
and I'll finish it.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.835
Come on,
you've never finished...

24:26.920 --> 24:28.956
anything in your entire life,
Dennis.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.031
Oh, now, you... That's not...

24:31.120 --> 24:32.678
- You know...
- Look, You can't
even finish a sentence.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.715
Don't... don't...

24:33.800 --> 24:35.392
You're just bein',
you know, what's the word?

24:35.480 --> 24:36.435
Cock?

24:36.520 --> 24:38.556
I would settle for something
shaped like a fish.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.595
Well, go to the fishmonger!

24:39.680 --> 24:41.398
I'm a vegetarian.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.516
OK. OK.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.079
Dennis, just please leave.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.355
OK. OK, I'll go.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.793
But I'm gonna
prove this to you, Libby.

24:48.880 --> 24:52.031
I can be mature, considerate,
and responsible.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.029
- Oh!
- Dennis?

24:55.120 --> 24:56.235
Yes, Libby?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.073
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.639
Oh, yeah, right.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.553
Hey, if Dennis thinks
he can run the race...

25:03.640 --> 25:04.629
he can run the race.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.039
- Thank you.
- There's no way

25:06.120 --> 25:07.633
you can run a marathon.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.188
- Why not?
- 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.191
Hey, I'll have you know
I go to spin classes.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.838
You went to one.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.592
Yeah, and now
you walk like John Wayne.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.199
Hey, this is important to me.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.628
I mean it!

25:20.720 --> 25:24.633
Look, I'm sick of
being a nearly man, all right?

25:24.720 --> 25:25.675
I'm sick of being scared.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.034
I'm sick of the regret
I feel every day...

25:27.120 --> 25:29.270
'cause I didn't have the guts
to marry the woman I love!

25:30.920 --> 25:32.831
All that ends
tomorrow at 6 A.M.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.591
# Ow! #

26:32.080 --> 26:33.115
Not bad.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.355
Hi.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.475
Feel better?

26:53.560 --> 26:54.959
Much.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.076
Oh, how was spin class?

26:58.800 --> 27:01.234
Uh, it was...
It was an amazing workout.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.679
Is that right?

27:03.760 --> 27:05.193
Yeah. And I also thought
it would be...

27:05.280 --> 27:07.077
a good chance for me
to get to know Whit...

27:07.160 --> 27:08.752
a little bit better, so...

27:08.840 --> 27:10.876
Well, maybe we should all go out
for dinner then.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.075
- You think?
- Yeah.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.798
And then we could go dancing.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.711
- You're jokin'.
- No, not at all.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.155
And then, afterwards,
we could come back here...

27:18.240 --> 27:19.434
and have a threesome.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.308
Oh. You are joking.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.594
Of course, I am.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.795
Look, Dennis, I don't know
what's going on...

27:24.880 --> 27:26.154
in that head of yours,
but whatever it is...

27:26.240 --> 27:27.798
- I don't like it.
- I've... There's nothing...

27:27.880 --> 27:29.552
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.629
- You ready for school?
- Yeah.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.711
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.988
Can I walk with you guys?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.115
OK.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.593
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.555
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.429
All right, you ready?

27:44.520 --> 27:45.555
Yeah.

27:52.440 --> 27:55.910
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round
at Libby's pretty early, eh?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.513
Whit stayed over last night.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.794
- Oh?
- Yes.

27:58.880 --> 27:59.995
They were jumping on the bed.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.275
Wow.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.312
Hey, Jakey, guess what?
Uh, I spoke to my friend...

28:07.400 --> 28:09.356
and he does have an extra ticket
for the show tonight.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.908
What do you say
we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.399
Yeah!

28:13.480 --> 28:15.311
- Yay.
- What, he told you about Emily?

28:15.400 --> 28:16.435
Oh, yeah.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.635
Oh, and, uh...

28:18.720 --> 28:21.553
Libby tells me that you
decided to run the marathon?

28:21.640 --> 28:22.629
Yeah.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.870
That's great, man. Seriously.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.154
Really, that's awesome.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.309
Thank you.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.355
How did you manage to get in?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.395
What do you mean?

28:29.480 --> 28:30.959
Well, you can't
just show up and run.

28:31.040 --> 28:31.995
Well, why not?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.354
You have to apply in advance.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.315
Well, how far in advance?

28:35.400 --> 28:36.799
Uh, three months.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.835
And when is it again?

28:37.920 --> 28:39.273
Three weeks.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.315
Right.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.628
They'll make exceptions
sometimes...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.950
if you're running for a charity,
but, uh, you know...

28:44.040 --> 28:46.679
each charity is only allowed
a certain amount of runners.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.159
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.355
I'll get in.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.714
All right.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.836
You ever, uh,
run a marathon before?

28:52.920 --> 28:54.114
No. Why?

28:55.120 --> 28:56.269
It's pretty gruelling.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.635
Well, yeah, that's why
they call it a marathon.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.071
Yeah, actually, technically,
it's called a marathon...

29:02.160 --> 29:04.515
because of the events
of 490 B.C.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.033
There was a Greek soldier...

29:06.120 --> 29:07.075
- named Phei...
- Say, can I just...

29:07.160 --> 29:08.673
- stop you there?
- Yeah.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.511
I've got have nothing to say.
I just wanted to stop you there.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.193
All right, all right.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.470
Hello. Is that
the Cats Protection League?

29:22.360 --> 29:23.315
Hello. I was just...

29:23.400 --> 29:24.628
I'm... I'm running a marathon
next month...

29:24.720 --> 29:26.517
and I was wondering if I could
possibly run on your behalf?

29:28.320 --> 29:29.719
Great. Yeah, yeah.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.916
OK. I see.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.719
How big is the costume?

29:35.920 --> 29:37.797
OK. I'll call you back.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.913
Ooh.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.035
Hi.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.268
- Dennis.
- Oh, yes?

29:44.360 --> 29:46.157
Would you mind not doing that
in front of the customers?

29:46.240 --> 29:48.276
Sorry. I went for a run
this morning in my trunks...

29:48.360 --> 29:49.952
and I think
I've got a bit of a rash...

29:50.040 --> 29:51.678
you know,
down there in the, uh...

29:51.760 --> 29:53.398
- I understand.
- Scrotal zone.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.436
- I understand, Dennis.
- OK.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.080
Please, keep your hands
out of the scrotal zone...

29:58.160 --> 29:59.275
whilst you're at work.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.429
Will do.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.075
Shh.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.355
Dennis!

30:42.800 --> 30:43.835
Sorry. I was, um...

30:45.480 --> 30:46.515
I was in the zone.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.637
So, um, I'd actually
be dressed as a brain.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.870
Um, can I call you back?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.070
# Just 'cause you think it #

31:06.160 --> 31:08.355
# It don't make it so #

31:08.440 --> 31:11.000
# Drive you to drink #

31:11.080 --> 31:13.514
# Won't let you go #

31:13.600 --> 31:17.673
# Plenty of girls
and boys in love #

31:17.760 --> 31:18.715
Come on!

31:18.800 --> 31:20.631
# Plenty of girls #

31:22.200 --> 31:23.997
# And boys in love #

31:27.360 --> 31:29.271
Would you like a cup of tea,
Dennis?

31:33.760 --> 31:35.716
So that's it.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.074
Running this marathon
could be my last chance...

31:37.160 --> 31:38.752
to show Libby that I can change.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.275
Mmm.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.469
You know what I would do
if I were you?

31:47.560 --> 31:48.515
What?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.909
I would get some cream
for that rash.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.631
Let me ask you something,
Dennis.

31:54.720 --> 31:58.554
Why did you leave your lady at
the altar when she was pregnant?

31:58.640 --> 31:59.914
I don't know.
Just wasn't ready.

32:02.120 --> 32:06.511
The toothpaste was already
out of the tube, my friend.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.395
Being ready
had nothing to do with it.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.039
I was scared.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.155
Mmm.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.713
So, you are a coward.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.472
I thought we were just
gonna have a cup of tea.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.396
You did not think
you were good enough.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.833
Am I right?

32:25.920 --> 32:27.956
You thought of your lady,
and you were terrified...

32:28.040 --> 32:29.519
you could not give her
what she needed...

32:29.600 --> 32:30.919
what she deserved.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.392
I thought the same things...

32:34.480 --> 32:37.438
on the day I married
Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.155
May she rest.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.233
Did you?

32:43.320 --> 32:45.072
Yes. But guess what?

32:45.160 --> 32:48.118
It turned out
I was good enough.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.872
I made myself good enough.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.192
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.838
But she loved you once, and you
must have earned that somehow.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.399
Yeah.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.593
Did you have a good marriage,
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.954
Ah.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.514
I remember the feeling
of being complete...

33:13.240 --> 33:17.597
of spending every day
with my best friend...

33:17.680 --> 33:19.033
but most of all...

33:21.440 --> 33:24.796
I remember all the fucking.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.753
Mmm...

33:32.560 --> 33:34.073
Mmm...

33:37.360 --> 33:39.476
Oh, three degrees starboard,
skipper.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.039
Hey, I'm the captain.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.873
Mutiny! Mutiny!

33:45.680 --> 33:47.033
Whoa!

33:47.120 --> 33:49.634
Ahoy there, me lad.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.918
- Oh!
- Hey, Jakey.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.955
Sorry, we're late, love.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.553
Soon as Whit found out
we we're meeting here...

33:55.640 --> 33:57.039
he had to go get his vessel.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.079
Jakey, here.
Flip that switch.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.230
No, not that one. That one.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.718
Whoa! Can I steer it?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.597
No.
But you can watch me steer it.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.594
Mutiny.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.713
Hey. You wanna?

34:14.679 --> 34:16.476
- Was he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.870
We had a really nice time
until Captain Bligh turned up.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.951
Whit just likes to take things
very seriously.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.507
Prepare to be boarded,
or feel the hot wrath...

34:24.600 --> 34:27.114
of Her Majesty's
royal fusillade!

34:28.719 --> 34:29.947
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.639
Why won't you
let me steer it?

34:32.719 --> 34:34.438
Uh, because it's mine.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.839
So, you're still gonna run
in this marathon?

34:35.920 --> 34:36.989
Yes, absolutely.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.559
It's gonna be great.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.437
You're gonna see
a whole new Dennis.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.793
Right, well,
I've been thinking about it...

34:41.880 --> 34:44.074
and the thing is, I don't care.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.353
What do you mean?

34:45.440 --> 34:47.476
Dennis, what do you think
you're going to achieve?

34:47.560 --> 34:49.676
Do you honestly think
that running 26 miles...

34:49.760 --> 34:51.239
is just gonna wipe
the slate clean?

34:51.320 --> 34:52.435
Well, you might change your mind
when you see me...

34:52.520 --> 34:53.554
in jogging shorts.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.800
Look, Whit's having
a birthday party...

34:59.880 --> 35:00.835
for me in a couple of weeks...

35:00.920 --> 35:03.559
and it would mean a lot to Jake
if you came.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.675
To Jake?

35:06.440 --> 35:07.475
Hey!

35:09.400 --> 35:10.435
Hey!

35:11.760 --> 35:13.079
Hey!

35:13.160 --> 35:14.115
Hey, OK.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.189
Whose boat is this?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.669
Whose boat... is this?!

35:17.760 --> 35:20.638
Excuse me!
Is... Is this your boat?!

35:22.080 --> 35:23.877
- No way!
- He's toast.

35:23.960 --> 35:24.995
He won't last.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.869
Would you like some pizza,
Dennis?

35:31.960 --> 35:33.837
Oh. Yes, I would actually.
Thank you very much.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.875
- Ow!
- Come here.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.076
What are you doing that...
Stop it.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.035
Are you still gonna do this?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.235
Are you still gonna
run the marathon?

35:40.320 --> 35:41.355
I want to, yes.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.475
Thank God.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.475
Why?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.755
Because I just bet them
every penny I have.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.353
What? You bet on me?

35:50.120 --> 35:51.394
Dennis, you're my best friend.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.232
I'm not gonna bet against you.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.233
Well, thank you.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.673
Not with these odds.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.389
Well, what if I don't finish?

35:58.480 --> 36:00.198
Vincent'll kill you.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.395
Oh, you'll finish.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.799
How can you be so sure?

36:06.640 --> 36:11.031
Get up, get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

36:13.400 --> 36:15.197
So, you're gonna be my coach.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.633
That's right.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.675
Why are you here?

36:17.760 --> 36:19.990
I'm the assistant coach.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.069
Why do you get
to be assistant coach?

36:21.160 --> 36:22.718
Because I have this spatula.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.835
Ow!

36:25.440 --> 36:26.395
Go on. Get running.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.630
Wait. Isn't there some sort
of special technique?

36:29.760 --> 36:31.318
Yeah, you put one leg
in front of the other...

36:31.400 --> 36:33.391
over and over again really fast.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.709
Why are you here again?

36:35.800 --> 36:37.279
- Ow!
- Motivation.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.952
# I said, yeah #

36:39.040 --> 36:40.359
# I said, yeah #

36:40.440 --> 36:42.908
- # What they said #
- # What they said #

36:43.000 --> 36:44.399
- # Oh, I said, yeah #
- Lift your knees higher!

36:44.480 --> 36:45.435
- You're not gonna get...
- # Yeah, yeah #

36:45.520 --> 36:47.112
- anywhere like that!
- # It's what they said #

36:47.200 --> 36:48.997
- You've gotta slide more.
- # What they said #

36:49.600 --> 36:51.556
- # Do you believe I would
take something with me #
- Come on, Dennis!

36:51.640 --> 36:53.517
- You want to feel my spatula?!
- # And give it #

36:53.600 --> 36:54.953
- No, I do not!
- # To the police man? #

36:55.040 --> 36:57.634
- Then run! Run like the wind!
- # I wouldn't do that #

36:58.240 --> 36:59.309
- # And if I do that #
- This is harder...

36:59.400 --> 37:01.118
- # I would say, "Sir" #
- for me, you know?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.599
# "Come on
and put the charge on me" #

37:02.680 --> 37:04.159
Ow!

37:04.240 --> 37:05.912
# I wouldn't do that #

37:06.000 --> 37:09.151
- # No, I wouldn't do that #
- Come on, Dennis! Come on!

37:09.240 --> 37:11.800
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good!
- # I'm not a fool
to hurt myself #

37:11.880 --> 37:13.359
- Come on, Dennis.
Keep up the pace.
- # I was innocent #

37:13.440 --> 37:15.556
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- # Of what they done to me #

37:15.640 --> 37:17.517
# They was wrong #

37:17.600 --> 37:18.555
I think I got a blister.

37:18.640 --> 37:19.629
- # They were wrong #
- OK.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.948
Yeah, gently.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.075
All right.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.793
OK! Oh! All right.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.552
- Is it bad?
- No, it's not that bad.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.153
No. No. It's not.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.470
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.393
Look at that thing.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.959
It's like a womb.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.669
Don't.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.715
Hey, maybe there's a little man
in there...

37:41.800 --> 37:43.597
who looks just like you,
but he's really good at running.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.113
What are you talking about?!

37:45.200 --> 37:46.349
It's just a thought.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.589
You're gonna have to pop it.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.953
No. No way.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.519
Never pop
another man's pustule.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.113
Well, I'll do it then.
Give me the needle.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.474
That's the closest I could get.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.235
It's fine. I sterilized it.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.355
In what?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.519
It's sterilized.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.478
OK, OK. Here we go.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.669
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.359
Stick it in.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.589
- Pop it!
- I can't!

38:14.680 --> 38:16.113
- Why not?
- It's scary!

38:16.200 --> 38:17.428
Give it to me.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.475
Just do it slow!

38:18.560 --> 38:19.595
- Do it... Do it gently, OK?
- Yeah.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.159
- Trust me.
- After three, OK?

38:21.240 --> 38:22.355
- OK.
- One.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.835
It's in it!

38:28.400 --> 38:30.072
Get it out!

38:30.160 --> 38:31.639
Bloody take it out!

38:31.720 --> 38:33.073
- Hold still! Hold still!
- Get it!

38:40.840 --> 38:41.875
I'm so sorry.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.033
That's never happened before.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.473
Oh! Oh!

38:48.640 --> 38:49.755
I'm Catholic.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.753
That was the second
most disgusting fluid...

38:52.840 --> 38:54.068
I've ever had in my eye.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.629
Who's that?

38:56.720 --> 38:57.709
That's Mr G.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.472
Get something nice on,
something respectable.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.595
Where we goin'?

39:20.280 --> 39:22.316
Every year,
literally hundreds of people...

39:22.400 --> 39:25.710
are affected by acute
neurocortical emphasitis...

39:25.800 --> 39:27.597
or Hapsburg Syndrome.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.635
I see.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.029
And how does the condition
manifest itself?

39:31.880 --> 39:32.869
The syndrome
is characterized...

39:32.960 --> 39:34.678
by a loss
of lower body function...

39:36.480 --> 39:39.074
sporadic and often violent
outbursts of profanity.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.151
And often chronic flatulence.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.198
It's our aim to raise awareness
of the condition...

39:53.280 --> 39:54.599
and, hopefully,
some funds to give...

39:54.680 --> 39:56.272
some much-needed support...

39:56.360 --> 39:58.316
to people such
as Mr Ghoshdashtidar here.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.628
Mmm...

40:02.840 --> 40:05.593
- Well, we think
that Mr Goshdashti...
- Ghosh!

40:05.680 --> 40:07.557
- Ghoshtashtidar...
- Ghosh! Ghosh!

40:07.640 --> 40:11.110
Ghoshtashtidar's condition
is very, uh, serious...

40:11.200 --> 40:14.715
and warrants support,
and we'd be delighted...

40:14.800 --> 40:19.351
for Mr Doyle to run
on behalf of acute neuro...

40:19.440 --> 40:20.634
Acute neurocortical emphasitis.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.153
- Or, uh...
- Hapsburg Syn...

40:22.240 --> 40:24.674
Syndrome awareness. Yes.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.075
OK.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.793
We'll just need the charity's
registration number.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.515
The what?

40:33.600 --> 40:34.874
The registration number.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.319
Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.038
Mmm.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.269
- Look out!
- Oh!

40:46.360 --> 40:47.588
Ohh!

40:47.680 --> 40:49.193
Aw, hit by a wheelchair.

40:50.920 --> 40:51.955
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:52.040 --> 40:52.995
- It stings.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.035
- It stings.
- No, no, no, no!

40:54.120 --> 40:55.439
Dennis, don't touch him.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.475
- Can you stand?
- Oh, no!

40:56.560 --> 40:58.710
- Are you OK?
- No. My leg's broken.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.869
We are so sorry.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.154
You... Call an ambulance!

41:02.960 --> 41:03.915
Oh, this can't be happening.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.797
I was supposed to be running
the marathon in three weeks.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.949
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.439
There were so many people
dependin' on me.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.829
Charity people?

41:10.920 --> 41:12.478
- Hmm?
- Yeah. God!

41:12.560 --> 41:14.516
What charity people?

41:14.600 --> 41:15.828
What do you think?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.835
Nice.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.115
Nicotine patch?

41:24.200 --> 41:25.155
Applied.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.390
- You been to the toilet?
- One and two.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.309
You ready?

41:30.760 --> 41:31.795
Ready.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.115
One.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.595
Ow.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.635
- Two.
- Get up there.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.756
# This is a jailbreak #

42:00.840 --> 42:02.876
# This is a Thursday afternoon #

42:02.960 --> 42:05.110
# But I didn't mean it #

42:05.200 --> 42:07.555
- # I didn't mean it #
- Ow!

42:07.640 --> 42:09.676
# I'd never get that far #

42:09.760 --> 42:11.876
# My baby,
short breath wouldn't do #

42:11.960 --> 42:13.916
# But you took it serious #

42:14.000 --> 42:15.797
- # Took it so serious #
- Raise.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.313
- No!
- No!

42:18.960 --> 42:21.076
One, two...

42:30.080 --> 42:31.832
One more! One more!

42:33.920 --> 42:38.471
# Well, you accused me
of wearing movies in my eyes #

42:38.560 --> 42:40.596
# But I still love you #

42:40.680 --> 42:42.875
# Of course, I love you #

42:42.960 --> 42:44.791
# And so I countered #

42:44.880 --> 42:47.314
# You do the same, my Annie I #

42:47.400 --> 42:49.755
# You closed them so fast #

42:49.840 --> 42:54.311
# And you closed them so tight #

43:31.320 --> 43:32.878
- Hi, Dennis.
- Wha...

43:32.960 --> 43:35.599
I saw your friend Gordon
this morning.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.398
I will replace
anything he stole.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.232
He told me
about his little bet.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.275
Oh, yeah.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.078
- Yeah. Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

43:42.160 --> 43:43.991
So I made a crazy little bet
of my own.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.832
Ooh. Who with?

43:45.920 --> 43:47.273
With you, silly.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.952
- We haven't made a bet.
- We're about to.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.639
Here it is.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.675
You finish the race...

43:52.760 --> 43:55.035
I'll forgive
all the back rent you owe.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.872
- And if I don't?
- If you don't finish...

43:56.960 --> 43:58.279
you pack your bags
and you leave.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.238
You go, and I finally get
some tidy tenants...

44:01.320 --> 44:02.878
who pay their rent on time.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.076
- Deal?
- No deal.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.037
Hey, what are you...
Hey, give me that.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.155
- Deal?
- Deal.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.437
- Maya, if you think making...
- Maya?

44:15.520 --> 44:16.919
Hey. Hello, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.433
How are you?

44:18.520 --> 44:20.636
I've got something for you.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.631
Ooh. It's not the spatula,
is it?

44:22.720 --> 44:24.039
No.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.635
Wow.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.077
To help you be a good man.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.635
I don't...

44:42.680 --> 44:43.715
Thank you.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.515
Wow.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.716
Peter Perfect, a perfect palace.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.836
Try saying that
when you're smashed.

44:54.920 --> 44:57.753
- I will.
- # Lately #

44:57.840 --> 45:01.958
# I been high-steppin' #

45:04.880 --> 45:05.949
# I've got a lover #

45:06.040 --> 45:09.191
- # Who just gets it for real #
- Hey. Hey, Dennis.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.918
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.069
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.957
Wow, Libby.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.439
You look, um... wow.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.475
Thank you.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.073
I know, right?
Never mind all this.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.037
I'll take the view
I have right here.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.269
Oh.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.876
I'm Gordon, Libby's cousin.
Hello.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.678
Gordon. Of course.
I've heard a lot about you.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.159
Very nice to meet you.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.753
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.558
Oh. I thought you said
he was an asshole.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.435
- Dennis!
- Gordon.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.033
- What?
- It's OK, Lib.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.559
Libby, I got you
a birthday present.

45:39.640 --> 45:40.914
Oh.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.319
It's a CD.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.992
I hope you don't have it,
'cause I don't have a receipt...

45:44.080 --> 45:45.957
and I didn't exactly
get it in a shop.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.712
Well, thank you, I think.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.839
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

45:52.360 --> 45:55.591
I'll show you, and, uh,
you can entertain Dennis.

45:55.680 --> 45:56.635
OK.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.029
That is if he doesn't mind
hangin' out with an asshole.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.237
He was joking. I never
said you were an asshole.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.276
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.355
Whit seems nice.

46:07.440 --> 46:08.429
Yeah, he is.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.988
Good-looking, friendly,
well-off, steady job...

46:11.080 --> 46:12.035
good with Jake...

46:12.120 --> 46:13.633
just like you got him
out of a catalogue.

46:13.720 --> 46:14.835
And what's your point?

46:14.920 --> 46:17.275
I ordered a pair of shoes
once from a catalogue.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.351
Gorgeous soft leather
Italian loafers.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.589
They looked amazing,
but then they arrived...

46:20.680 --> 46:22.716
and I put them on,
and they hurt like fuck.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.028
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.279
Wow.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.271
Hey, do you think it would
be weird if I took a bath?

46:31.360 --> 46:33.078
Yeah, that would be weird.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.678
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.193
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.508
Cheers.

46:38.600 --> 46:39.635
Cheers.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.233
What do you think?

46:43.320 --> 46:45.311
I think I see a guy
peeing on your car.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.435
- What?
- Got you.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.511
Oh, very good.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.511
Actually, you see that?

46:51.600 --> 46:52.555
What?

46:52.640 --> 46:54.278
There. I'm talking
about St. Paul's Cathedral.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.634
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.278
Currently my favourite spot
in London.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.475
You know why?

46:58.560 --> 47:00.596
Uh, is it because that's
where you first realized...

47:00.680 --> 47:01.829
how amazing you are?

47:03.760 --> 47:05.113
It's the finish line
for the marathon.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.229
Only two more days,
and I get to cross it.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.275
Can't wait.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.839
Me, too.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.956
Greatest feeling in the world,
finishing a distance race.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.190
I think you're really
gonna get a kick out of it.

47:14.280 --> 47:15.474
You don't think
I'm gonna finish, do you?

47:15.560 --> 47:16.549
No, I don't.

47:16.640 --> 47:17.595
Why not?

47:17.680 --> 47:19.398
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.754
Actually requires
a couple of things...

47:20.840 --> 47:23.638
that, uh, forgive me,
but you don't seem to possess.

47:23.720 --> 47:24.948
I happen to have
a very nice pair...

47:25.040 --> 47:26.598
of running shoes now,
thank you very much.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.753
I'm talking about discipline
and perseverance.

47:30.840 --> 47:32.956
And all cute
little comments aside...

47:33.680 --> 47:34.954
there comes a point
in every race...

47:35.040 --> 47:36.758
it could be the fifth mile,
it could be the 25th...

47:36.840 --> 47:38.273
but, eventually,
you're gonna hit...

47:38.360 --> 47:40.157
what runners like to call
"the wall."

47:40.240 --> 47:41.514
And when you do...

47:41.600 --> 47:44.194
you won't be able to breathe
or think or even move.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.316
All you're gonna wanna do
is give up.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.833
And I have
a very strong feeling...

47:47.920 --> 47:50.036
that that's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.675
See, that's the difference...

47:51.760 --> 47:54.035
between getting a girl
like Libby...

47:54.120 --> 47:55.519
and keeping a girl like Libby.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.155
You good?
You need anything else?

48:02.240 --> 48:04.231
- No, I'm good.
- OK.

48:11.200 --> 48:15.273
# Love is sweet, they say #

48:17.120 --> 48:21.910
# Promises of tomorrow #

48:23.040 --> 48:29.718
# But the tighter you grip,
the faster you slip #

48:29.800 --> 48:33.395
# This much I know #

48:34.800 --> 48:37.758
# Lately, I want everything #

48:37.840 --> 48:40.513
# Every star tied to a string #

48:40.600 --> 48:43.433
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

48:43.520 --> 48:46.353
# The sweetest smile
I've ever seen #

48:46.440 --> 48:49.830
# A different song
in every room... #

48:49.920 --> 48:52.036
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
- That's OK.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.872
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
- Oh, man. It's just...

48:53.960 --> 48:55.473
It's just soda water, honestly.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.754
Should I not rub
your boob, then?

48:57.760 --> 48:59.239
- Yeah.
- OK. Sorry.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.355
I can do the other one,
you know?

49:00.440 --> 49:02.396
'Cause I'm here, I might as well
just even it out.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.515
Sorry.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.633
So, you havin' a...
havin' a good time?

49:08.440 --> 49:10.829
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.395
You've lost weight.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.708
Yeah, just a little bit.

49:16.800 --> 49:17.755
Yeah.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.239
You know, get on.

49:19.320 --> 49:22.278
Where's Jake?
I thought he was gonna be here.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.588
Uh, no.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.159
Whit thought that we'd have
a better time...

49:25.240 --> 49:27.071
if we got a sitter.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.435
Oh. What did you think?

49:33.760 --> 49:35.239
I should get back.

49:35.320 --> 49:38.073
Libby, um,
I never actually thanked you.

49:39.720 --> 49:40.675
For what?

49:40.760 --> 49:44.196
Well, for just sort of
lettin' me back into your life.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.872
Jake's life.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.279
Yeah, well, you know.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.789
I mean, I-I wouldn't have
been surprised...

49:49.880 --> 49:51.677
if you just cut me off
completely, you know?

49:51.760 --> 49:53.079
Ugh, now you tell me.

49:54.440 --> 49:55.839
Well, no, I mean...

49:55.920 --> 49:57.114
No, he needs his dad.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.435
Yeah.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.074
You were right, you know,
about me enterin' the marathon.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.230
It... You know,
it was because I was...

50:07.320 --> 50:09.151
sort of trying to win you back
kind of thing.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.595
And I'd always kinda hoped
that maybe, we'd, you know...

50:11.680 --> 50:12.795
get back together and that...

50:12.880 --> 50:15.474
but, you know,
when I saw you with Whit...

50:16.320 --> 50:17.639
- Dennis.
- I know... I know... I know...

50:17.720 --> 50:20.678
I know it's the height
of hypocrisy, and I know...

50:20.760 --> 50:22.159
I know doin' this
isn't gonna change anything...

50:22.240 --> 50:24.549
or... or make anything better,
but, um...

50:27.000 --> 50:28.911
I'd just...
I'd settle for your respect.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.509
You know,
I'd settle for you smiling...

50:32.600 --> 50:34.955
when you thought about the time
that we had together...

50:35.040 --> 50:37.076
and not thinkin'
it was a waste of time.

50:39.240 --> 50:40.229
You know, I mean, I know...

50:40.320 --> 50:43.437
I didn't do you any favours
on that day, OK?

50:43.520 --> 50:46.239
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.198
But it was
only because I thought...

50:49.280 --> 50:51.874
spoiling your day was better
than ruining your life.

50:53.880 --> 50:55.598
Does that make any sense?

50:59.280 --> 51:00.554
You're such an idiot.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.074
Hey, I got you something.

51:07.160 --> 51:08.752
Oh, what is it?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.876
It's something
I think you don't have.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.598
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

51:14.200 --> 51:16.350
No, it's...
Well, it's only, you know...

51:16.440 --> 51:17.509
- Open it later on.
- OK.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.158
Happy birthday.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.593
- Thank you.
- No.

51:23.960 --> 51:24.995
Oh.

51:43.360 --> 51:45.476
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

51:45.560 --> 51:49.269
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.430
Everyone, hi.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.475
Thank you for coming.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.039
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.429
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

51:56.520 --> 52:00.115
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.276
Happy birthday.

52:04.360 --> 52:07.750
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.994
In fact,
in a couple of days...

52:10.080 --> 52:12.469
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

52:15.480 --> 52:18.517
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

52:18.600 --> 52:21.114
of the same things
as success in love...

52:21.200 --> 52:23.589
passion, determination...

52:23.680 --> 52:26.319
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.313
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

52:31.400 --> 52:32.674
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

52:32.760 --> 52:36.275
is that both love and running
require heart...

52:36.360 --> 52:38.396
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

52:38.480 --> 52:40.311
than any other person
I've ever known.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.960
So happy birthday, sweetie.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.114
Thank you all.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.712
Oh, trainers!

52:53.520 --> 52:56.114
I'm sorry. Can I, uh,
just see this for a second?

52:56.200 --> 52:58.760
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

52:58.840 --> 53:01.832
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

53:03.400 --> 53:05.709
I was wondering
if you would consider...

53:05.800 --> 53:07.074
becoming my partner?

53:13.160 --> 53:14.195
Oh, my.

53:15.560 --> 53:18.358
Libby, will you marry me?

53:30.880 --> 53:32.472
No, no, no, no.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.028
OK. Yes.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.633
- Yes?
- Yeah.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.594
So beautiful.

53:53.600 --> 53:54.999
Just beautiful.

53:55.760 --> 53:56.795
Thank you.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.275
Thank you, everybody.

54:01.800 --> 54:02.835
Crazy.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.875
What'd I miss?

54:08.320 --> 54:09.355
So...

54:11.200 --> 54:13.555
You bloody... poison.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.231
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

54:18.320 --> 54:20.914
you big American prick.

54:21.920 --> 54:24.070
# Our love has changed #

54:26.960 --> 54:29.633
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

54:32.160 --> 54:34.833
# And the only way to say it #

54:36.720 --> 54:38.472
# Is say it #

54:39.960 --> 54:41.439
# It's better #

54:44.680 --> 54:46.477
# I can't concede #

54:50.440 --> 54:52.874
# This way I feel #

54:55.200 --> 54:57.794
# For all the time
we spend together #

54:59.960 --> 55:04.351
# Forever just gets better #

55:06.960 --> 55:09.997
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

55:11.520 --> 55:15.877
# You make things better #

55:18.320 --> 55:21.995
# And no matter
what the day is #

55:23.080 --> 55:27.631
# With you here, it's better #

55:31.080 --> 55:33.150
# I'll stand by you #

55:36.960 --> 55:39.554
# If you stand by me #

55:41.560 --> 55:44.916
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

55:46.080 --> 55:48.116
# 'Cause I believe it #

55:49.400 --> 55:51.516
# It's better #

55:53.640 --> 55:56.916
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

55:58.160 --> 56:02.790
# You make things better #

56:13.160 --> 56:14.388
Dennis!

56:16.880 --> 56:18.632
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

56:19.960 --> 56:22.918
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.232
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

56:32.160 --> 56:33.388
You know, just...
If he heard it from you...

56:33.480 --> 56:36.040
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

56:36.120 --> 56:37.838
I take it the diet's off.

56:40.320 --> 56:42.117
Dennis, are you even listening?

56:42.200 --> 56:43.189
Dennis!

56:43.280 --> 56:44.793
What? You want...
You want me to tell Jake...

56:44.880 --> 56:47.030
what a... what a...
what a perfect guy Whit is...

56:47.120 --> 56:48.394
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

56:48.480 --> 56:49.959
in his new perfect life?

56:50.040 --> 56:52.315
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.789
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.950
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.837
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

56:58.920 --> 57:00.956
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.156
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

57:03.240 --> 57:05.151
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

57:05.240 --> 57:06.719
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

57:06.800 --> 57:08.756
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

57:08.840 --> 57:10.512
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

57:10.600 --> 57:12.352
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

57:14.400 --> 57:15.674
I'm not gonna run.

57:15.760 --> 57:16.715
What?!

57:16.800 --> 57:18.233
I said I'm not running.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.679
What do you mean,
you're not running?

57:24.760 --> 57:26.830
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.079
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.115
What did you think?

57:30.200 --> 57:31.599
She... She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

57:31.680 --> 57:32.715
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

57:32.800 --> 57:34.313
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

57:34.400 --> 57:35.879
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

57:35.960 --> 57:37.951
I don't care any more!

57:38.640 --> 57:40.198
- What about me?
- What about you?

57:40.280 --> 57:41.998
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

57:42.080 --> 57:43.638
That is not my problem!

57:44.800 --> 57:45.835
Quit it!

57:45.920 --> 57:47.069
I'm not the quitter.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.033
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

57:55.120 --> 57:56.394
- Let go!
- Ow!

58:06.680 --> 58:07.715
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

58:07.800 --> 58:11.190
Oh, enough!
Just... Just stop for a minute!

58:20.880 --> 58:22.677
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

58:23.920 --> 58:26.354
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

58:26.440 --> 58:28.715
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

58:29.160 --> 58:31.151
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

58:31.240 --> 58:32.832
# Unless, unless #

58:32.920 --> 58:34.114
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

58:34.200 --> 58:35.155
# In my bones #
- No!

58:35.240 --> 58:36.434
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

58:36.520 --> 58:37.669
# Of staying in control #

58:37.760 --> 58:40.911
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

58:41.000 --> 58:43.514
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

58:43.600 --> 58:45.113
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

58:45.200 --> 58:46.519
# I'm sorry I digressed #

58:46.600 --> 58:49.239
# Impressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

58:49.320 --> 58:51.197
# Oh-oh #

58:51.280 --> 58:53.794
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

58:53.880 --> 58:56.917
# Oh-oh #

58:57.000 --> 58:59.673
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

58:59.760 --> 59:01.273
That's what you always do!

59:02.240 --> 59:03.639
Run away!

59:05.400 --> 59:07.197
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

59:11.360 --> 59:12.873
Hey, what the...

59:13.680 --> 59:15.318
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

59:15.400 --> 59:16.355
Gordon called.

59:16.440 --> 59:18.396
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.879
- Yeah, but...
- But, what?

59:19.960 --> 59:21.234
Are you running or not?

59:21.320 --> 59:22.275
- No, but...
- So there you go.

59:22.360 --> 59:23.509
- Wait...
- Sorry, Dennis.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.158
A bet's a bet. You're out.

59:25.800 --> 59:28.189
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

59:28.280 --> 59:29.599
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

59:29.680 --> 59:32.069
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

59:32.160 --> 59:35.311
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.356
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

59:37.440 --> 59:38.873
- Look...
- Always running away...

59:38.960 --> 59:40.393
never running
in the right direction.

59:40.480 --> 59:41.435
Yeah, but, oh...

59:41.520 --> 59:44.034
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

59:44.120 --> 59:46.554
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.392
- Yes, but...
- "But, but, but!"

59:48.480 --> 59:51.472
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

59:51.560 --> 59:54.233
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

59:54.320 --> 59:57.756
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.351
It's all your fault!

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.308
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.472
You... You havin' a yard sale?

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.316
No. Where's Libby?

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.833
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.356
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.113
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.755
Best man won.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.598
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.715
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.755
No, why? L...

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.068
Well, is he here, Whit?

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.309
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.355
- Libby?
- Jake!

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.509
Libby, what is...

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.953
- What did you say to him?!
- L... What are you...

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.189
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.429
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.555
He just ran out.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.790
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.233
Jake ran away!

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.835
Jake!

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.355
Jake!

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.755
Gordon!

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.395
Gordon!

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.238
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.151
- What?
- He's run away!

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.195
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.032
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.269
Where would he go?

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.113
Hiya, snot-face.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.154
Yeah, he's fine.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.355
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.634
OK.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.188
Is she mad at me?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.998
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.358
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.238
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.435
Why not?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.670
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.318
and he's got a ponytail...

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.391
and she likes him now.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.311
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.958
Uh-huh.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.274
Jake 'n Bake...

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.588
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.875
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.190
Things much worse than this.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.475
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.391
Why not?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.710
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.789
You know,
when you start running...

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.835
the problem's still there.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.434
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.432
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.397
Is that what you do, Dad?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.194
Dad?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.835
Dennis!

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.114
Dennis!

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.235
Gordon!

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.995
Gordon!

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.672
- Found him?
- Yes.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.512
Good. You can't stay here.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.235
Gordon!

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.275
What?!

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.112
I'm running.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.879
Well, come on up then.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.076
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.559
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.709
See, the trick is...

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.075
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.115
I read it in Cosmo.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.189
How are the legs? Not too tight?

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.713
No. No, they're fine.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.915
Have you got everything
you need?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.309
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.152
- Yes.
- Oh.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.159
I'm not really in the mood.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.719
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.189
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.599
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.908
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.955
is nipple chafing.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.234
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.514
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.477
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.118
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.275
Anything else?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.429
Have you got a pillow?

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.670
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.071
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.118
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.792
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.711
I never need to be anywhere.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.399
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.438
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.714
OK.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.955
Night.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.075
Love you.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.675
A very good morning to you.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.557
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.551
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.835
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.558
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.039
We certainly have.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.270
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.396
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.311
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.914
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.228
And as we can see,
race officials...

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.197
are already busy
at the starting line...

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.748
with the start
less than an hour away.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.512
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.919
Taxi!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.753
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.795
Wait!

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.835
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.114
# I'm gonna be the one #

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.872
# To make you understand #

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.188
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.555
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.039
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.519
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.397
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.357
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.592
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.148
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.708
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.155
Watch it!

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.632
- Idiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.355
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.873
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.712
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.869
are the men from Kenya.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.316
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.153
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:29.995
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.433
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.954
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.109
Have you got any money?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.918
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.831
That is a shame.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.035
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.031
Look, look. This is a 19...

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.430
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.475
That's not too shabby.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.515
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him...

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.715
Hey, it's an investment.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.234
Gordon, thank you.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.435
I'll see you later then.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.073
# Keep on runnin' #

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.388
Hey, good luck!

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.232
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.390
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.754
They had a balanced breakfast...

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.071
precise physical
and mental preparation.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.232
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.231
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.639
or a complete idiot.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.029
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.793
Over here. To me, to me.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.269
That's it. Be careful.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.429
That's an antique.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.191
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.429
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.794
What do we love
about these days...

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.030
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.712
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.952
from the elite over there
to the... how should we put it...

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.519
not so elite.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.874
That's Dennis!

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.592
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.269
Double or nothing?

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.315
Yeah, right.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.915
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.231
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.275
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.315
Yeah.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.913
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.560
You, too. How are your nipples?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.035
Great.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.875
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.154
to go now,
and the officials are...

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.196
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:28.113
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.792
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.109
- It's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.236
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:47.594
Why am I always the tortoise?

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.635
A bet's a bet.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.675
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.113
- Pardon me.
- All right.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.473
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.912
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.794
I mean, uh...

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.029
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.109
now, do you?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.077
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.194
No, Dennis.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:07.435
This is now.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.475
All right.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.158
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.752
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.636
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.073
And they're off, Chris.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.752
Yet another great marathon...

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.558
getting under way
here in London.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.991
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.274
of crowded London streets...

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.032
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.075
Thanks.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.718
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.755
Oh, I'm glad.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.828
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.591
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.113
- What?
- Have a good race.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.635
Isn't it enough?

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.675
What?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.149
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.514
I just think it's high time
you realize...

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.113
that it's over, sir.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.599
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.875
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.393
You better
slow down there, chief.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.708
You got a long way to go.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.156
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.355
Yes, I like it.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.271
Run, fat boy, run!

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.113
I can lose weight...

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.031
but you'll always be
an asshole.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.995
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.274
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.749
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.068
What a beautiful view of the...

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.238
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.914
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.989
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.672
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.795
coming up from the back.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.875
Mom!

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.518
It looks like these two boys...

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.431
are running a race
of their own here today.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.669
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.829
among the serious runners.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.512
Not something
you'd really expect...

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.919
at this stage in the race.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.149
Oh. Sorry, sir.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.875
There's a man down.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.715
Sorry.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.440
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.272
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.635
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.155
But he looks good, doesn't he?

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.389
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.596
...setting a new world record.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.395
What are you trying to prove?

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.993
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.229
I'm not doing this for Libby.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.309
Yeah, right.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.389
You're ridiculous, dude.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.789
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.755
Oh!

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.555
Daddy!

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.437
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.234
It does look very serious.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.355
We're getting
some more information...

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.311
Stay down! Stay down!

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.079
Where do you think you're going?

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.754
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.831
Because I am
the assistant coach.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.515
Yes!

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.875
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.035
And that looks really painful.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.439
Looks like
this runner's race day...

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.431
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.794
Yeah, absolutely tragic...

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.359
Mom, do something!

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.873
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.279
To the leaders
in the female race.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.315
Shit.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.718
Huh?

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.920
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.355
when I say, "Give me my money."

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.158
Five grand, please.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.471
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.595
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.552
Uh... I don't have it.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.148
Would you excuse us a moment?

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.196
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.599
Are you family?

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.193
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.713
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.429
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.033
registered by that name.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.680
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.079
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.037
Well, he's just arrived.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.678
- Libby?
- Whit?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.954
How'd you know I was here?

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.359
What are you doing here?

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.510
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.034
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.633
Guys, can we... Can we just...

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.950
Fellas, can we...
Look, I'm a patient, please.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.553
Just one... Find me!

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.119
Easy, easy! Ow!

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.077
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.115
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.191
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.312
No, wait. Look... Vincent.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.913
Wait... Wait... What?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.194
Wait. Wait a tick.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.510
Not so bloody fast, mate.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.828
Who the hell are you?

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.478
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.232
Your friend is a man of honour.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.275
What, Vincent?

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.035
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.075
I don't understand.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.958
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.393
One second.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.833
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.114
I could sue him
for everything he has...

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.111
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.272
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.952
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.598
Well, you weren't there, OK?

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.636
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.870
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.713
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.917
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.831
No, but you can watch me
control it.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.753
Libby? Where are you?

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.068
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.115
No, he's not here.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.189
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.633
I mean, he's not here.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.713
Well,
where the hell is he then?

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.360
All right.
It's still... It's on.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.555
The race is still on.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.960
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.155
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.071
- Right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.912
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.389
- Vincent?
- Showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.711
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.711
and he's also causing
some major traffic...

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.668
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.796
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.835
What!

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.071
Wait! What are you doing?!

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.674
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.475
All right!

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.675
Hello, there...

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.557
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.868
Who the hell are you?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.593
You beauty, come on!

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.552
And as the sun
sets over London...

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.198
we're still looking
into the identity...

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.953
of that mysterious runner.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.429
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.238
The only concrete thing
we do know...

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.756
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.431
Good news, Mr Bloom.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.715
No rupture, no ligament damage.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.358
Oh, that's great.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.429
Jake, please?

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.193
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.069
Are you sure, doctor?

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.639
Jake, please.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.790
It's, uh, like, uh...

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.835
What is it you runners say?

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.353
You hit the wall.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.798
No, no, that...
That's not possi...

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.828
God damn it, will you stop...

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.911
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.509
God.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.955
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.758
Top story, the Nike River Run.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.637
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.075
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.718
about our mystery runner.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.438
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.555
has just caught up with him.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.595
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.829
Will you slow down, please?

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.278
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.112
Stop! Stop!

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.428
Everyone out. Get out.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.675
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.875
Hey!

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.109
Just go away!

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.109
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.428
Knock him over.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.272
No, invalid. Off-side.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.832
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.592
I want my money now!

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.193
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.269
You are a winner!

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.395
I want my money now!

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.835
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.875
Clear off!

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.155
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.391
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.118
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.272
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.432
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.953
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.359
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.714
What an inspiration.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.394
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.311
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.436
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.192
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. L...

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.872
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.632
- By the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.199
- Honey, can we just...
- but particularly by

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.235
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.275
Would you mind just giving us...

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.793
a little peace with the TV,
please?

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.235
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.275
The whole of London...

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.555
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.358
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.559
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.595
Oh.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.398
I'm the assistant coach.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.038
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.192
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh...

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.235
- Ghosh...
- Gah...

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.912
OK, just call me John.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.958
It was me who discovered
his potential.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.679
I can't breathe.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.634
My head's gonna explode.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.278
He's not gonna make it.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.918
L... I have to stop.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.319
- I have to stop this.
- No.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.469
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.709
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.199
What? How much further?

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.511
Lt... It's a little, tiny...
Nine miles.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.198
OK. OK.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.274
Oh, no.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.395
What?

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.954
He's hit it.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.358
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.035
Jakey.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.111
...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.633
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.314
It looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.311
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.197
on basically one leg...

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.716
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.791
Unbelievable!

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.993
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.270
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.634
I'm not the quitter!

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.676
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.830
Go on, run away!
Run away!

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.433
That's what you always do!

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.515
Dennis!

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.835
Dennis!

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.553
Dennis?

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.759
Oh, I don't believe this.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.159
Yeah, boy, yes!

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.719
He's still going!

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.837
Go on, you beautiful man!

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.797
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.440
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.839
in the drama of it all.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.752
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.875
And here it is.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.313
It appears
that the runner there...

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.551
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.189
In fact, if we look at it again
here... yes!

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.350
He deliberately trips him!

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.953
Bastard!

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.268
Apologies again, uh...

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.237
That didn't...
That's not what happened.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.753
That is...
That... That didn't happen.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.398
I can't believe this.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.435
I don't believe it, either.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.475
I don't understand that.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.515
What is that?

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.953
Honey. Honey...

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.999
That angle makes it look, but...
He tripped me.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.837
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.514
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.668
Go, Dennis!

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.474
I can't believe this.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.754
Come on, honey.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.159
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.028
What are you...
Are you kidding me?

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.235
Honey.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.869
All right, look,
I'm just... I'm not...

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.393
I'm not myself, OK?

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.158
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.673
Work has not been...

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.277
It's, uh...

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.315
It's just this city, you know?

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.311
It's just...
It's really hard here for me.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.913
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.956
and it's like the food and the...
and the... and the ca...

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.359
I just don't... I don't
know what happened to me.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.078
I don't know what...
It's just this place.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.229
It's this place, you know?

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.153
And if we... I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.753
- Move?
- To Chicago.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.034
What?

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.269
Too soon?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.315
Oh!

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.879
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh...

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.154
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.031
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.314
You can't be serious.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.198
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.274
Nobody's perfect.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.355
Libby.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.032
Libby! L...

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.109
What a shithead.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.235
Jake.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.078
Hey. I know you feel bad.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.149
I know you're
in incredible pain...

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.549
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.435
Come on.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.628
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.792
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.953
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.634
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.358
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.795
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.632
for myself and my cameraman.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.473
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.515
but for Dennis Doyle...

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.068
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.395
Come on, Dennis!

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.395
Good work, Dennis!

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.959
Hey! Move along!

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.995
That's it. You're there.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.718
You're sixty feet.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.074
Fifty... Fifty-eight feet.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.229
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.275
and you're there. Come on.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.352
That's my man! My man!

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.789
Come on, come on!

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.395
Dennis, come on.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.550
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.755
Don't get up.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.835
Dennis!

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.829
Dennis, come on, get up.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.399
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.032
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.155
Get up.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:06.675
Hello, Dennis?

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.757
- Dennis!
- Dad!

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.270
Dennis!

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.395
Dad!

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.512
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.710
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.555
Yeah!

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.995
Dad!

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.108
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.952
Don't go to Chicago.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.553
Dad, you won!

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.114
He's done it!

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.838
He's actually done it!

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.989
This morning...

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.436
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.988
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.798
Oh, yay.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.074
And look at that!

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.275
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.191
collapses into the arms of...

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.635
I think it's backwards here...
the woman he loves!

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.109
And, look! He's got a son!

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.156
I didn't know he had a son!

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.753
Did you know he had a son?

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.278
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.759
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.478
Jake, your dad's here!

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.039
How's it goin'?

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.348
- Pretty good.
- Good.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.714
- You?
- Yeah.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.199
Yeah, not bad.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.349
You still running?

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.317
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.478
Yeah. So...

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.668
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.395
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.115
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.394
I'll, um...

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.674
I'll sp... I'll ca...
I'll speak to you later.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.273
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.429
Bye, Mom.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.475
Bye. I'll see you later.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.675
Bye.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.517
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.431
and have some dinner
with me next week?

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.275
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.509
Yeah.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.874
Uh... huh?

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.439
I mean, wow.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.589
It'd be nice.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.477
Yeah. Well, it would be.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.318
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.389
OK.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.913
Don't know why I did that.
It's just...

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.714
OK. Ready?

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.835
Yeah.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.952
Hello!

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.519
Hello, Dennis!

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.274
Mr G.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.677
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.318
I was just doing my spin class.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.355
It's great fun, isn't it?

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.795
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.438
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.669
Come on! Jake!

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.318
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.709
He has the ball! He's clear!

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.119
Dad! Pass it!

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.435
Dad is clear!

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.192
Give it!

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.032
I'll give you one, too.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.111
OK, let's go. Good game.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.792
Jake to Mr G.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.999
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.149
Take over, Mr G.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.509
There you go, Mr G.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.079
All right, I'm gonna...
Completely illegal move there.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.912
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.319
Runs with him all the way.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.879
Dad, that's illegal!

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.555
But that's not all.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.151
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.151
let alone run,
but he keeps going...

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.959
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.029
And you know how he did that?

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.269
You know what he said
was the one thing...

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.395
that kept him going?

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.748
His trainer
never gave up on him.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.592
He stayed with him
the whole way.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.635
And that was you?

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.755
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.398
It's a pretty amazing story,
actually.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.833
I've got a bottle of champagne
opened here...

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.955
if you wanna hear it.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.635
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.235
Well, come on up then.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.915
