00:05.905 --> 00:08.499
Man, who'd have thought?
Hyde getting busted for possession.

00:08.575 --> 00:13.808
I mean, I always thought it'd be, like,
armed robbery or... pimping.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.782
You know, something cool.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.081
Yeah, Hyde in jail.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.281
Hey, guys, do you think
he's anyone's girlfriend yet?

00:25.692 --> 00:28.559
Kelso, he's been in jail
for three hours.

00:28.628 --> 00:31.620
Of course he's someone's girlfriend.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.825
He has very pretty eyes.

00:36.136 --> 00:40.505
Well, if he was someone's girlfriend,
I think it might look something like this.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.710
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:44.778 --> 00:48.509
Hey there, curlicue, would you like to
perform an unspeakable act on me...

00:48.581 --> 00:51.015
or would you prefer
that I perform one on you?

00:51.084 --> 00:54.417
Well, they both sound good. Dealer's choice.

00:57.824 --> 01:01.055
You have done a horrible thing
with a children's toy.

01:06.132 --> 01:10.694
Huh. Bet you didn't want me
to see this, did ya?

01:10.770 --> 01:14.103
Hey! Welcome back, man!

01:14.174 --> 01:18.440
We were worried about...
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so sorry.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.380
Yeah, uh...

01:21.448 --> 01:26.613
You know, curlicue... is...
can be... is a term of endearment.

01:29.556 --> 01:33.253
So, when do we meet
your new fella?

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.500 --> 02:16.367
- Red, we really need to talk about...
- No. No. No!

02:16.436 --> 02:19.496
- <i>Steven!</i>
- No! I don't want to talk about Steven!

02:19.572 --> 02:21.506
Subject closed.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.508
Red...

02:23.576 --> 02:27.945
For God's sakes, Kitty.

02:28.014 --> 02:31.450
We took him into our home.
We treated him like our own son.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.646
Treat him better than
your own son.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.720
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not bailing him out.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.760
He can rot in that jail, for all I care.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.058
Actually, uh, they already
let him out. Gave him probation.

02:44.130 --> 02:50.000
Probation? Well, isn't that just ducky?

02:50.069 --> 02:53.470
You know how they treat
their criminals in Russia?

02:53.540 --> 02:57.237
First offense, five years in Siberia.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.778
Second offense, 10 years.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.441
Believe you me,
there is no third offense.

03:04.884 --> 03:10.379
Unless the criminal
likes to make snow angels.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.958
Hey. Steven brought that stuff
into my house.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.695
<i>And I'm puttin'a stop to it</i>
<i>before things get out of control.</i>

03:22.769 --> 03:24.760
Oh, out of control how?

03:24.837 --> 03:27.738
Well, I'll tell you how.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.604
Say, chum, where ya headed?

03:34.681 --> 03:37.377
Just to see my best girl
Donna, that's where.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.851
We're gonna split a soda pop.
It'll be keen.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.913
Soda pop, eh? I have something
that's even keener than soda pop.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.925
It's called marijuana.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.188
"Mari-what-a"?

03:49.262 --> 03:52.129
Come. I'll show you.

04:06.045 --> 04:10.482
Hyde, you were right.
Marijuana's the bee's knees.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.919
Yep. All it takes is one puff
to make you hopelessly addicted.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.185
I am... hopelessly addicted.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.126
Here's a new shipment, fresh from
whatever-the-hell country I am from.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.741
Gee whillikers, Eric. Where have you been?
You missed choir practice.

04:37.810 --> 04:42.747
Sorry, dollface. But now,
thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.

04:46.986 --> 04:50.353
Well, I'm not gonna let
a swell kid like you ruin your life.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.792
Not so fast, sister.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.318
I need that for the schoolchildren.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.025
No!

05:03.403 --> 05:08.932
Alas, marijuana has ended
my young, promising life.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.335
This is what's happening
all over America.

05:14.414 --> 05:20.375
And it could happen in your home,
or yours, or yours!

05:29.996 --> 05:33.329
I just don't think
that's gonna happen, Red.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.669
Has Hyde ever pressured you
to use this stuff?

05:36.736 --> 05:39.603
No. Absolutely not.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.039
In fact... Yeah, I can honestly say
I have never felt any pressure.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.718
Guess who?

05:53.786 --> 05:57.244
It's either Jackie or
the cold, clammy hands of death.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.156
It's Jackie!

06:00.226 --> 06:03.787
Damn it.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.230
Oh, Steven, my hero.

06:07.300 --> 06:11.703
When that cop found my bag, and you said it
was yours, and they sent you to the big house...

06:11.771 --> 06:14.604
it was, like,
the most romantic thing ever.

06:14.674 --> 06:17.973
Yeah, maybe for you.
I was deloused.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.715
Hey, man, you missed
your shift at the Fotohut.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.849
You better have
a damn good excuse.

06:32.925 --> 06:36.588
- I got busted.
- Damn. That's a good excuse.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.996
- So what'd they get you for?
- For loving me.

06:41.067 --> 06:45.629
'Cause she's, like, 14?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.869
I got busted for possession.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.308
Oh, man. Join the club.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.346
Yeah, thanks.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.247
No. I mean, join the club, man.

06:57.316 --> 07:00.251
We meet every Thursday.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.220
We're tryin' to raise money
for a field trip to Amsterdam.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.793
Hey there, Red. Takin' out the trash, I see.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.233
Yeah, well,
better late than never.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.463
Is that supposed to
mean something, Bob?

07:20.540 --> 07:25.136
No. Just happened to notice that
that low-life Hyde you've been harboring...

07:25.211 --> 07:27.179
has been busted for possession.

07:27.246 --> 07:31.876
My gosh! That stuff was right
here in our own neighborhood?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.985
To think of all the times
we had to drive across town...

07:36.055 --> 07:38.421
- to get it!
- Ix-nay, Midge!

07:44.831 --> 07:46.856
Well...

07:46.933 --> 07:50.835
as you all know, we had
a little incident yesterday.

07:50.903 --> 07:56.864
<i>And I think that as a family,</i>
<i>we should discuss</i> rational <i>solutions...</i>

07:56.943 --> 07:59.969
to make sure that
this never happens again.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.207
Can I start?

08:04.183 --> 08:08.119
Um, I'm not comfortable
living with a criminal.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.222
I think we should
kick Hyde out.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.656
All in favor?

08:13.726 --> 08:16.354
Laurie, stop it.
Red, what do you think?

08:16.429 --> 08:18.693
Kick him out! Kick him out!
Kick him out! Kick him out!

08:18.764 --> 08:21.756
Laurie, there is no way
we're kicking Steven out.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.667
Steven, we're kicking you out.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.307
- Yea, Daddy!
- Red!

08:29.375 --> 08:32.503
- What? Dad, that's not fair.
- Not fair?

08:32.578 --> 08:34.808
I took him in.
I gave him a shot.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.076
<i>He blew it. It's his fault.</i>

08:37.149 --> 08:39.708
Look, I don't want it
in my house.

08:39.784 --> 08:43.914
I don't want it around you two.
I just don't want it!

08:43.990 --> 08:48.552
Red, putting him out on the street
is not the solution.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.062
This young man needs our guidance
now more than ever.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.394
No, Mrs. Forman. It's cool.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.401
If, uh, Red thinks that I'm not
good enough to live in this house...

08:56.469 --> 08:58.403
then I guess I'm not.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.002
You know what?
You're... You're bull...

09:08.080 --> 09:12.380
I... I'm... You're very... I'm...
I'm very mad at you!

09:25.997 --> 09:30.024
God, this sucks!
I can't believe Red's kicking you out.

09:30.101 --> 09:32.626
I mean, I'm sorry,
where are you supposed to go?

09:32.704 --> 09:36.970
I'm gonna go to the Fotohut. I'll sleep
on the floor. They got a hose out back.

09:37.042 --> 09:39.602
Mrs. Forman made me a sandwich.

09:44.616 --> 09:47.312
Man, this is so wrong!

09:47.385 --> 09:50.081
I'm not gonna let you get kicked out
for something we all do.

09:50.155 --> 09:53.352
Hey, hey, don't go
draggin' me into this.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.792
You know what?
I'm gonna tell Red that I do it too.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.351
No!

09:58.430 --> 10:01.627
Have you suddenly become
the stupidest man ever?

10:02.801 --> 10:06.635
I mean, is Kelso
no longer the reigning king?

10:09.474 --> 10:11.965
Oh, I'm the king.

10:12.043 --> 10:15.137
This can work. If I tell Red, then he's gonna
be a hypocrite for kicking you out...

10:15.213 --> 10:17.147
and not making me
go with him.

10:17.215 --> 10:20.878
Because, I mean, he can't kick <i>me</i> out.
Because, deep down, he loves me.

10:27.058 --> 10:31.154
Look, Forman. I appreciate
what you're trying to do, you know?

10:31.229 --> 10:35.427
But you getting into trouble is not going to
help me get out of trouble, okay?

10:36.434 --> 10:38.368
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:38.436 --> 10:42.634
Okay. Everybody just stop worrying,
all right? I'll be fine.

10:42.707 --> 10:45.437
Yes. It will be good for you
in the Fotohut.

10:46.978 --> 10:49.742
Maybe you will develop some character.

10:52.851 --> 10:55.183
Get it? Develop?

10:56.721 --> 10:59.383
Oh, fine. I guess I'm not funny.

11:01.159 --> 11:03.389
Kiss my brown ass.

11:09.901 --> 11:11.926
Here's your tea, Leo.

11:12.003 --> 11:14.801
Oh, wow. Tea, man.

11:14.873 --> 11:17.899
That's, like, exotic.

11:17.976 --> 11:21.070
Hey, look at me. I'm the king of England!

11:22.180 --> 11:24.614
Off with her head.

11:24.682 --> 11:27.651
- Tea.
- Well, um...

11:27.719 --> 11:31.280
I... I think it's great that Steven
has a boss who cares enough to...

11:31.356 --> 11:35.224
to come over
and talk to us on his behalf.

11:35.293 --> 11:40.390
So, um, I'm just gonna let you fellas
get to know each other.

11:40.465 --> 11:42.763
Sit up straight, Leo.

11:45.036 --> 11:48.096
Hey, man, I don't think you should
kick Hyde out, because he's a good kid.

11:48.173 --> 11:52.337
- He's a doper.
- Well, you say that like it's a bad thing, man.

11:54.212 --> 11:56.976
Hey, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

11:58.183 --> 12:01.016
I've indulged once or twice myself.

12:02.086 --> 12:05.920
Really? I'm shocked.

12:05.990 --> 12:10.689
Yeah, I know. Upstanding businessman.
Last guy you'd expect.

12:10.762 --> 12:12.696
But it's true, man.

12:13.998 --> 12:17.490
Well, Mr.... Hippie.

12:19.604 --> 12:22.596
If you say so,
that's good enough for me.

12:22.674 --> 12:25.643
Oh, that's great, man.

12:29.113 --> 12:32.241
Now, please,
get out of my house.

12:36.287 --> 12:39.882
Okay, what are you writing?

12:39.958 --> 12:41.892
Jackie and Steven Hyde.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.327
Mrs. Jackie Hyde.

12:45.396 --> 12:50.356
Dr. And Mrs. Steven Hyde?
All right, what's going on?

12:50.435 --> 12:55.372
Okay. Donna,
Steven and I are in love!

12:55.440 --> 12:59.740
Um, you do know that he once
compared you to a tick, right?

12:59.811 --> 13:03.872
Oh, really?
Well, if he thinks I'm such a tick...

13:03.948 --> 13:07.509
why'd he tell the cops the bag was his
when it was actually mine?

13:07.585 --> 13:09.644
Are you telling me
that bag was yours?

13:09.721 --> 13:13.487
Yeah! And he went to jail for it!
Isn't that fabulous?

13:13.558 --> 13:17.392
Oh, my God. You... tick.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.726
You're the reason
this whole mess happened.

13:19.797 --> 13:23.233
Oh, Donna, stop.
My head is... Whoo!

13:25.036 --> 13:27.561
Jackie, you have to tell
the Formans what happened.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.573
Do you know that Red
is kicking Hyde out?

13:29.641 --> 13:32.075
Oh, God. No, no, Donna.
That's perfect!

13:32.143 --> 13:35.670
When Hyde is on the streets,
he'll have to turn to me.

13:35.747 --> 13:40.878
And as I care for him and buy him stuff,
his love for me will grow.

13:40.952 --> 13:43.477
Oh, my God.
Fine. I'm telling them.

13:43.555 --> 13:49.084
No! No, no, no.
You cannot ruin this for me, moose!

13:49.160 --> 13:51.628
Don't tell me
what to do, midget.

13:51.696 --> 13:54.995
No!

13:58.069 --> 14:01.630
Well, well. Turns out you were
all wrong about Steven.

14:01.706 --> 14:03.640
And you wanted to
kick him out.

14:03.708 --> 14:08.372
Yes, well... Thanks for telling us
the truth, Donna.

14:08.446 --> 14:10.380
And we know it wasn't
easy for you...

14:10.448 --> 14:14.214
especially with Jackie
choking you the whole time.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.558
Um, Steven, wait.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.560
You can stay.

14:25.129 --> 14:27.825
Cool.

14:27.899 --> 14:29.833
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.769
That's it?

14:32.837 --> 14:36.364
Isn't there anything else you would like
to say to this brave and noble young man?

14:36.441 --> 14:39.569
You're right, Kitty.

14:40.979 --> 14:43.880
Dumb-ass!

14:43.948 --> 14:47.384
Do you realize that you put
your entire future at risk?

14:47.452 --> 14:51.388
<i>What kind of a moron would go</i>
<i>and take the fall for some little...</i>

14:51.456 --> 14:54.050
Crying and crying and crying.

14:54.125 --> 14:57.094
- When she's upset, I'm upset.
- <i>And the next thing you know...</i>

14:57.161 --> 15:01.564
I had to have tea
with that greasy old hippie.

15:03.134 --> 15:06.365
And now I have hippie stink
on my couch.

15:06.437 --> 15:11.340
<i>Let me tell you something else.</i>
<i>If you ever do anything like that again...</i>

15:11.409 --> 15:15.311
I will kick your ass so hard
your nose will bleed!

15:19.584 --> 15:21.984
And we love you.

15:24.989 --> 15:27.924
So, uh, just so I'm clear...

15:27.992 --> 15:30.392
everything's back to normal, right?

15:30.461 --> 15:32.258
Yeah, yeah, everything's back...

15:32.330 --> 15:34.855
All right, Dad!
I've got something to say!

15:34.932 --> 15:37.366
Eric, for the love of God, don't.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.700
Dad, I do it too.

15:43.341 --> 15:47.141
That's right.
So you can't kick Hyde out.

15:48.646 --> 15:53.345
Honey, we already decided
not to kick Hyde out.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.720
Oh.

15:59.223 --> 16:02.522
Then...

16:02.593 --> 16:04.720
yea.

16:10.501 --> 16:14.403
So, you do it too, huh?

16:15.640 --> 16:17.608
Since when?

16:17.675 --> 16:20.940
Since when?

16:21.012 --> 16:22.946
Uh.

16:35.626 --> 16:38.959
I am so baked.

16:39.964 --> 16:42.432
I think. No, yeah, I am.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.434
I think.

16:44.502 --> 16:48.734
You know, guys,
I've been living my life all wrong.

16:48.806 --> 16:52.765
All I ever thought about was school...
studying, reading, homework.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.779
Well, that's over.
Thanks, Hyde.

16:56.948 --> 16:59.416
Hey, man, don't thank me.
Thank my mom.

16:59.484 --> 17:02.544
If she hadn't have passed out,
I couldn't have raided her stash.

17:03.821 --> 17:06.654
You have the best mom ever.

17:06.723 --> 17:10.751
Hey, guys, you know what?
Yesterday, I was wrestling with Donna.

17:10.828 --> 17:13.797
And I felt her boob.

17:13.865 --> 17:16.959
It was beautiful... and squishy.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.835
Squishy.

17:20.905 --> 17:25.035
Hey, guys, I had this dream
that I was kissing my English teacher.

17:25.108 --> 17:28.704
And when I woke up, I was stuck to my bed.

17:30.648 --> 17:34.641
Kelso, man, that's not normal.
You could die.

17:34.719 --> 17:36.812
Hey, isn't your
English teacher a guy?

17:36.888 --> 17:38.947
Yeah.

17:39.023 --> 17:42.322
No! I meant my Spanish teacher.
She's a girl.

17:42.393 --> 17:44.987
Man! What's in this stuff?

17:45.062 --> 17:49.931
Hey, guys, I'm having
the best time ever.

17:50.001 --> 17:53.061
I think. No, yeah, I am.

17:53.137 --> 17:55.435
<i>Eric?</i>

18:02.947 --> 18:05.040
<i>Eric!</i>

18:05.116 --> 18:07.744
Are you on it right now?

18:09.520 --> 18:11.647
I asked you a question.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.656
Since when have you
been using this?

18:13.724 --> 18:18.252
Uh, 'bout a week ago tomorrow.

18:19.597 --> 18:23.192
Um, what? Yeah! Coming, Mom!

18:25.970 --> 18:28.837
Okay. Okay, now.

18:28.906 --> 18:34.503
You're both smart boys.
What were you thinking?

18:34.579 --> 18:39.778
- Well, I... I'm not...
- Oh, oh, um...

18:39.851 --> 18:44.311
- The problem was that we weren't thinking.
- We weren't thinking.

18:44.388 --> 18:47.516
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>with the times... we're living in.</i>

18:47.592 --> 18:50.117
Yeah, the times are, like...

18:50.194 --> 18:52.355
- And, um...
- Peer pressure.

18:52.430 --> 18:55.194
And the peer pressure.
Thank you, Mom.

18:55.266 --> 18:59.862
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and I found that today, the need to experiment...

18:59.937 --> 19:05.034
Oh! Don't try this
blaming society crap with me.

19:06.611 --> 19:10.138
You know whose fault this is?
Do you? Do you?

19:10.214 --> 19:13.342
Well, I have a pretty good idea.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.215
It's mine.

19:16.287 --> 19:18.812
- Oh. All right.
- Okay.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.892
The problem is...

19:22.960 --> 19:25.224
I've been too lenient.

19:25.296 --> 19:30.996
So, from now on, no more easygoin',
devil-may-care, everybody's-best-friend dad.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.303
I'm just...
I'm so very nervous.

19:40.344 --> 19:42.437
I'm cracking down.

19:42.513 --> 19:44.572
And I'm cracking down hard.

19:44.649 --> 19:49.348
Starting right now...
fun time is over!

19:54.825 --> 19:56.759
So where was I for fun time?

20:02.133 --> 20:04.294
- Take it back!
- No, Kelso.

20:04.368 --> 20:07.064
I'm sorry. Confessing to Red
makes Eric the king.

20:09.507 --> 20:13.500
Hey, I shot my toe
with a B.B. Gun once.

20:13.577 --> 20:15.408
You're right, Kelso.
You're the king.

20:15.479 --> 20:17.606
Thank you!

20:20.117 --> 20:22.517
I mean, when I say,
"For the love of God, don't."

20:22.586 --> 20:24.645
Then, for the love of God, don't.

20:26.857 --> 20:28.916
Donna, that could have
meant anything.

20:28.993 --> 20:31.393
Okay. I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake.

20:31.462 --> 20:36.195
All right, excuse me. But I think we've all
lost sight of what's really important here.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.201
We're in love.

20:39.870 --> 20:43.772
All right, all right. You know what?
Enough of your girly fantasy crap.

20:43.841 --> 20:46.139
None of this would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

20:46.210 --> 20:49.373
So get this through your
little Easy-Bake Oven head...

20:49.447 --> 20:51.881
I don't love you.
I don't like you.

20:51.949 --> 20:54.281
I can barely stand
to look at you. Okay?

20:55.319 --> 20:58.447
Oh, Steven, you're such a bad liar!

21:05.196 --> 21:08.825
All right. Well, don't mind me.

21:08.899 --> 21:11.800
I'm just here to install this...
smoke detector.

21:13.371 --> 21:17.865
Smoke detector?
Does that detect <i>any</i> kind of smoke?

21:19.810 --> 21:22.643
Long live the king.

21:28.652 --> 21:31.314
Hey, guys, look what I found
in my sister Laurie's drawer.

21:31.389 --> 21:33.653
Mints. A whole month's worth.

21:37.661 --> 21:40.596
They're not minty.

21:40.664 --> 21:46.102
They're not mints. They're birth control
pills, you headgear-wearing moron.

21:46.170 --> 21:49.628
Hey, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be handsome.

21:50.674 --> 21:52.608
Really? Did your
Mommy tell you that?

21:54.678 --> 21:56.612
Yeah.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.614
Kelso, you're the king.
