<i>Get outta here! Come on!</i>

00:24.923 --> 00:26.750
<i>Get up! Come on, up.</i>

00:41.226 --> 00:43.824
<i>You should have told me.</i>

00:45.981 --> 00:49.145
You and Anastasia...

00:49.179 --> 00:52.477
I could have come to terms with it.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.105
But you turned her against me.

00:56.383 --> 00:58.669
- I think he knows.
- He doesn't know.

01:00.122 --> 01:02.240
<i>I treated you like family,</i>

01:02.275 --> 01:04.626
and you turned my daughter against me?

01:04.661 --> 01:06.645
No.

01:06.679 --> 01:08.763
You did that yourself.

01:10.015 --> 01:12.432
<i>You won't tell me where she is?</i>

01:15.458 --> 01:17.607
I don't know where she is.

01:19.524 --> 01:25.029
You gave up your freedom for her.
And now you will die for her.

01:25.070 --> 01:29.534
- Yes.
- No.

01:29.568 --> 01:32.156
You will not die.

01:32.191 --> 01:35.312
You will suffer.

01:35.347 --> 01:41.489
You will know fear...
and pain and despair...

01:41.523 --> 01:45.717
every single day you are in here.

01:47.197 --> 01:49.577
<i>This much I promise you.</i>

01:55.211 --> 01:57.261
<i>You're not begging.</i>

01:57.295 --> 02:00.142
You have always been so proud...

02:02.894 --> 02:04.739
so much like me.

02:05.947 --> 02:13.359
- I will never be like you.
- We'll see.

03:24.555 --> 03:28.996
I know just how deep to
go without killing you.

03:42.299 --> 03:45.080
Every single day.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.198
<i>Now you can go to sleep.</i>

05:38.488 --> 05:40.691
<i>15-minute rest stop, folks.</i>

05:40.725 --> 05:42.959
<i>We'll be in Pittsburgh before noon.</i>

05:54.905 --> 05:57.007
Hey, ladies.

05:57.042 --> 05:59.676
<i>I'm a sinner. Will you pray for me?</i>

05:59.711 --> 06:02.578
Guess a blow job would
be pushing it, huh?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.681
<i>Huh, fucking bitches.</i>

06:23.600 --> 06:26.134
<i>- I gotta go.
- All right, I'll see you later.</i>

06:28.004 --> 06:31.006
I don't fuckin' believe it.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.781
No fuckin' way.

06:51.762 --> 06:53.128
My father wants a word with him.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.365
<i>Alex tells me you're still mad at me.</i>

06:56.399 --> 06:57.701
Yes, I am.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.570
I cleared the way for the
hotel with the zoning board.

07:00.604 --> 07:02.639
I got all the permits fast-tracked.

07:02.673 --> 07:06.876
I made sure the environmental
impact report wasn't an issue.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.713
Burton, get the man a chair.

07:17.087 --> 07:19.888
It was a murder charge.

07:20.958 --> 07:24.459
It's a political vendetta.
It won't amount to anything.

07:24.494 --> 07:29.865
I apologize if I offended you, friend.

07:29.933 --> 07:35.271
Apology accepted.
How've you been feeling?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.343
Cut the bullshit, paleface.

07:39.411 --> 07:42.746
We all know the spirit
horse is coming for me.

07:42.781 --> 07:45.984
I already heard its hoofbeats.

07:49.154 --> 07:54.125
And... you have concerns.

07:55.327 --> 07:58.230
Your word is the only bond I need.

08:03.803 --> 08:06.506
But your son...

08:06.540 --> 08:10.311
with all due respect, Benjamin,
he doesn't share our past.

08:10.346 --> 08:14.716
My son will fulfill my promises.

08:16.452 --> 08:19.854
Then I'll treat Alex with the
same respect I've treated you.

08:19.888 --> 08:23.224
I'll consider your promise his to keep.

08:24.860 --> 08:30.232
But if he breaks it,
it won't be a good day for the tribe.

08:30.266 --> 08:35.138
I will talk with Alex.

08:35.172 --> 08:39.174
Now, the landowners at the site...

08:39.210 --> 08:43.511
I understand there's one
that doesn't want to sell out.

08:43.546 --> 08:45.582
Yeah, it's the Reverend.

08:45.616 --> 08:50.354
<i>He's a decent man, stubborn.</i>

08:50.388 --> 08:53.256
<i>He'll sell.</i>

08:53.290 --> 08:56.693
<i>He just doesn't know it yet.</i>

09:03.000 --> 09:05.101
Hello, Deborah.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.207
What do you want?

09:10.241 --> 09:14.378
- Is your husband home?
- Arthur's around back.

09:14.412 --> 09:16.413
Thank you.

09:22.386 --> 09:24.053
<i>Morning, Reverend Ramsey.</i>

09:24.088 --> 09:26.756
<i>Thought I would've heard
back from you by now.</i>

09:36.066 --> 09:38.067
I want you to taste something.

09:38.102 --> 09:41.437
The pipes in my house, they
draw the water from the aquifer,

09:41.471 --> 09:45.375
but I prefer to drink
it straight from here.

09:45.409 --> 09:48.411
Same well my
great-grandfather drank from.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.047
Same bucket, even.

09:50.082 --> 09:53.751
When my son was born,
the entire congregation

09:53.785 --> 09:55.921
of First Methodist came out here.

09:55.955 --> 09:59.557
We baptized him with the water
from that very well.

09:59.591 --> 10:02.361
I understand your
attachment, Mr. Ramsey.

10:02.429 --> 10:04.530
I even admire it.

10:04.564 --> 10:07.366
But you're not a 19th
century homesteader.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.704
You have a Prius,
a Facebook page, and a 401k.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.676
We'll double the payout.

10:15.743 --> 10:18.845
We'll secure you equal
acreage within the district.

10:18.913 --> 10:21.749
You can dig a new well.

10:21.783 --> 10:25.218
I'd be worried that any
land you secure for me

10:25.253 --> 10:27.922
would involve
forcing someone else out.

10:27.956 --> 10:32.827
Now listen to me, Reverend.
You're gonna leave.

10:32.861 --> 10:36.297
You can do it with grace
and some cash in your pocket,

10:36.331 --> 10:38.367
or you can do it broke.

10:38.434 --> 10:42.204
- But it's gonna happen.
- I'm gonna have to pray on it.

10:42.238 --> 10:44.773
If God was looking out for you,

10:44.808 --> 10:47.543
I wouldn't be at your door now, would I?

10:47.577 --> 10:50.680
Huh?

11:06.296 --> 11:07.765
Hood.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.600
<i>Hey, I've been trying
to get you on the radio.</i>

11:09.634 --> 11:13.638
- Where the hell are you?
<i>- Serving the people.</i>

11:13.672 --> 11:16.007
<i>Well, look, I got a guy here
in the cage for shoplifting.</i>

11:16.041 --> 11:18.976
He's got a... got a long sheet.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.013
- A really long sheet.
- <i>Well, I'm sure you can handle it.</i>

11:22.048 --> 11:24.482
Leonard Vanderwick... does
that mean anything to you?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.419
- Nope. Why?
<i>- Well, the guy says he knows you</i>

11:27.453 --> 11:29.454
<i>and he won't talk to anyone else.</i>

11:30.789 --> 11:33.258
What do you mean knows me?

11:33.292 --> 11:36.227
I don't know. He just...
get down!

11:37.330 --> 11:38.897
He won't tell me anything else.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.665
<i>I was gonna take him over
to the court for processing,</i>

11:40.699 --> 11:44.502
<i>but he insisted that he use his right
to one phone call to contact you.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:48.139
<i>- Leonard Vanderwick?</i>
- Yep. What do you want me to do?

11:48.173 --> 11:50.141
You want me to get him processed?

11:50.176 --> 11:53.645
Yeah, no. I'll be right over.

12:00.319 --> 12:05.123
- I gotta go.
- Sounds that way.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.393
Is it okay if I just
stay here and maybe nap?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.696
<i>It's quiet.</i>

12:11.730 --> 12:14.699
The Moody boys becoming
a problem for you?

12:14.734 --> 12:18.368
What, are we going steady now?

12:18.403 --> 12:21.639
I can handle Cole's idiot brothers.

12:35.086 --> 12:37.688
<i>This is Deputy Lotus in Banshee.</i>

12:37.723 --> 12:40.891
<i>I'm just wondering how
soon we'll get the... yeah.</i>

12:40.925 --> 12:46.096
<i>The file number... it's 00170455.</i>

12:53.672 --> 12:55.407
Do I know you?

13:00.146 --> 13:03.649
I don't know, "Sheriff".

13:03.683 --> 13:06.317
<i>Do you?</i>

13:33.215 --> 13:35.683
How you doing there, champ?

13:38.254 --> 13:42.090
You're not up to solid foods yet, hmm?

13:42.125 --> 13:43.993
Come on, let me get you to sit up.

13:52.235 --> 13:55.772
- Leave it.
- All right, all right.

13:55.806 --> 13:57.607
I just didn't want it to go to waste.

13:57.641 --> 13:59.408
Here you go.

14:08.752 --> 14:11.754
<i>Here. Looks like you're having
some trouble there, brother.</i>

14:15.259 --> 14:19.830
Just hold that right there.
I'm Wicks.

14:27.471 --> 14:29.438
You want some water?

14:36.681 --> 14:38.649
<i>Whoa, easy, easy.</i>

14:38.683 --> 14:41.851
<i>Easy there.</i>

14:41.886 --> 14:45.422
You won't wanna heal too fast.

14:45.456 --> 14:48.892
The Albino, man... this and solitary,

14:48.927 --> 14:51.728
<i>the only two places he can't get to you.</i>

14:54.365 --> 14:56.199
The Albino.

15:01.738 --> 15:04.273
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:04.307 --> 15:08.878
<i>He already put the word out...
you're his property.</i>

15:08.912 --> 15:10.512
I don't know what you did, man,

15:10.547 --> 15:14.784
but your chances of survival
just took a nosedive.

15:19.089 --> 15:21.624
What do I do?

15:21.658 --> 15:24.594
I suggest you get really
good at sucking cock.

15:24.629 --> 15:27.564
<i>I'm serious.</i>

15:27.598 --> 15:31.368
The Albino's a crazy motherfucker,
but he's also full-on queer.

15:31.403 --> 15:33.170
You're young, good-looking.

15:33.204 --> 15:36.907
You show him some love, maybe
you don't end up in a wheelchair.

15:36.942 --> 15:39.076
It's not gonna happen.

15:40.778 --> 15:43.648
You need to accept that
it will happen, man.

15:43.682 --> 15:48.119
<i>Every single day you are in here.</i>

15:48.153 --> 15:51.388
You got no place to hide.

15:51.423 --> 15:56.027
But how it happens, you might
be able to put a spin on that.

15:57.396 --> 16:01.366
You give it to him before he takes
it and curry some fuckin' favor.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.234
That's your best shot.

16:08.207 --> 16:13.078
Listen, are you gonna eat that sandwich?

16:25.158 --> 16:27.793
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome, Sheriff.</i>

16:30.063 --> 16:34.433
So, uh, how long you been out?

16:36.303 --> 16:39.372
A little while.

16:39.406 --> 16:44.310
- You?
- Been out about two years.

16:44.345 --> 16:46.813
Did some work for my sister's
husband down in Florida.

16:46.847 --> 16:51.651
It's nice there.
You could work outdoors all year round.

16:51.685 --> 16:55.589
But her husband, he didn't
like me being around the kids.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.124
He thought I was poisoning
their minds or some shit.

16:58.159 --> 17:00.561
He said he was letting me
go on account of the economy,

17:00.595 --> 17:03.263
but the fucker just wanted me gone.

17:11.006 --> 17:13.007
<i>Hey, enough about me, man.</i>

17:14.777 --> 17:17.712
How the fuck did you pull
off this little miracle here?

17:17.746 --> 17:20.615
It's complicated.

17:20.648 --> 17:23.852
- No shit, it's complicated.
- And temporary.

17:23.886 --> 17:27.855
<i>- What are you gonna have?</i>
- Don't know yet.

17:28.990 --> 17:32.193
- You're setting up a job.
- No.

17:32.261 --> 17:34.262
Now, listen, man.
You know you can trust me.

17:34.296 --> 17:37.232
And right now, I'm what
you'd call highly available.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.201
No, Wicks, it's not like that.

17:43.639 --> 17:45.807
Come on, man.
You owe me!

17:45.841 --> 17:47.441
Keep your fucking voice down.

17:47.475 --> 17:50.344
Listen, man, I'm not
gonna fuck this up for you.

17:50.379 --> 17:53.213
But I'm tapped out.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.549
You have no idea.
I'm not living right.

17:56.584 --> 17:58.151
I know what I look like.

17:58.185 --> 18:00.887
I've been sleeping on
the fuckin' streets, man.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.289
<i>I just need a break.</i>

18:04.925 --> 18:07.261
Or I'm gonna be back
in the cage in a month.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.862
At least I get fed there.

18:08.896 --> 18:13.266
Look, order whatever you want.
I'll be back.

18:19.006 --> 18:22.408
- I see you made a new friend.
- Yeah, I'm a friendly guy.

18:22.443 --> 18:25.312
<i>- Give me an apple pie.
- Coming right up.</i>

18:25.346 --> 18:28.326
He's wall-to-wall prison tats.
I think you're the last guy

18:28.626 --> 18:30.517
who'd want to be seen
keeping that kind of company.

18:30.551 --> 18:33.319
- Mrs. Hopewell, I didn't know you cared.
- Be smart.

18:33.354 --> 18:35.121
What, are you worried about me?

18:35.155 --> 18:39.492
- I'm worried about me.
- No. No, that's not it.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.902
You're worried about me.

18:51.073 --> 18:52.940
Just be smart.

19:09.159 --> 19:10.827
Nice.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.761
Here you go.

19:27.796 --> 19:30.693
A clean bed.
You can take a hot shower.

19:30.728 --> 19:32.626
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.

19:32.661 --> 19:35.361
I'll come by tomorrow with
some clean clothes for you.

19:39.994 --> 19:41.662
Then what?

19:43.229 --> 19:47.263
Uh...
we'll talk.

19:48.163 --> 19:49.929
All right.

19:51.029 --> 19:55.363
Hey.
Thank you.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.163
Sure.

20:47.105 --> 20:48.971
None of them will come near you.

20:52.305 --> 20:55.906
- But you will?
- Well, now...

20:55.939 --> 20:58.873
see, me, I make myself indispensable.

20:58.907 --> 21:03.205
I'm a purveyor of certain
goods, mostly pharmaceutical.

21:03.240 --> 21:06.507
And the Albino, he likes his narcotics.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.240
Where is he?

21:11.275 --> 21:14.541
He don't come out in the yard.
You seen his eyes?

21:14.575 --> 21:17.508
Stays out of the sun
like a fuckin' vampire.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.808
- How do I get to see him?
- You don't.

21:22.976 --> 21:25.075
What are you, some kind of masochist?

21:25.110 --> 21:28.510
- He'll find you soon enough.
- Come on.

21:31.444 --> 21:34.142
You see blondie over
there with the football?

21:34.177 --> 21:36.143
- Yeah.
- That's Billy B.

21:36.177 --> 21:38.844
<i>That's the Albino's main squeeze.</i>

21:38.878 --> 21:41.211
<i>If you want in, that's your access.</i>

21:41.245 --> 21:46.377
But I'm telling you...
I wouldn't do that.

21:56.848 --> 21:58.880
You know how to throw a ball.

21:58.914 --> 22:01.714
Yeah, I won two state championships.

22:02.948 --> 22:07.681
Oh, it's you.
Almost healed up, huh?

22:09.249 --> 22:12.015
What the fuck you want?

22:27.585 --> 22:29.618
I'm sorry, man.

22:29.653 --> 22:35.152
I told him he didn't have
an appointment. He insisted.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.285
I can always make
time for an old friend.

22:44.553 --> 22:48.786
You see?
Prison can be very liberating.

22:48.820 --> 22:54.186
Billy B here, he was as straight
as they come on the outside.

22:54.220 --> 23:00.919
Son of a minister, star quarterback,
fucked the prom queen... all of that.

23:00.954 --> 23:03.819
Then one day, he went
and got drunk and ran over

23:04.120 --> 23:06.986
some old lady and her
grandson and ended up in here.

23:11.189 --> 23:15.054
And now he's in love.

23:15.088 --> 23:19.556
Well, the heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

23:22.091 --> 23:24.868
They did a good job with you, huh?

23:24.902 --> 23:28.975
I mean, fuck, you were a mess...
what was it... a month ago?

23:29.010 --> 23:30.577
About that.

23:30.611 --> 23:33.512
So you found me before I could find you.

23:33.546 --> 23:38.083
I appreciate that.
It shows gumption.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.718
I wanna make a deal.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.722
- What kind of deal?
- The kind that keeps me healthy.

23:42.756 --> 23:46.392
I really can't do that.

23:46.427 --> 23:49.729
See, my deal with Mr. Rabbit
makes that a conflict of interest.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.700
- You understand.
- Rabbit doesn't need to know.

23:56.004 --> 23:58.340
And now you're insulting me.

24:01.610 --> 24:05.046
But I know a way you
can make up for that.

24:17.692 --> 24:20.561
Gotta be honest, uh...

24:20.595 --> 24:23.631
I just don't feel that close to you yet.

24:24.866 --> 24:27.835
It's gonna happen.

24:27.869 --> 24:31.405
I could make it happen
right now, but I'm not gonna.

24:33.442 --> 24:35.977
Because when you do it,

24:36.012 --> 24:41.684
you're gonna do it willingly,
gratefully.

24:43.886 --> 24:47.423
And while you're
greedily sucking me off,

24:47.457 --> 24:52.228
like a babe suckling
on its mother's tit,

24:52.262 --> 25:00.002
that's when you'll understand
that I own your ass.

25:03.006 --> 25:05.308
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

25:10.748 --> 25:14.618
<i>And the next time we meet's
gonna be something special.</i>

25:14.652 --> 25:17.154
Mr. Rabbit has requested
a small piece of you,

25:17.188 --> 25:23.294
<i>something to prove to him</i>
that I'm holding up my end.

25:28.433 --> 25:32.703
- So how long are you in for?
- 20.

25:32.737 --> 25:36.040
That's a long time to be anyone's bitch.

25:36.075 --> 25:40.445
You know, whatever you're thinking,
you can just forget it.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.715
- You belong to him now.
- We can take him down.

25:45.586 --> 25:50.122
- Together.
- Fuck you.

25:55.194 --> 25:58.764
You're his bitch now, just like me.

26:08.475 --> 26:11.210
<i>Stay down! Stay down!</i>

26:11.245 --> 26:13.112
Oh, fuck.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.619
<i>Fighting in the yard</i>

26:19.653 --> 26:21.188
<i>buys you 30 days in the hole.</i>

26:21.222 --> 26:22.923
The shiv gets you another 90.

26:22.957 --> 26:27.594
Keep it up... you'll be an old man
<i>by the time you see a real bed again.</i>

26:29.097 --> 26:30.831
<i>Yeah, lookin' sharp!</i>

26:33.402 --> 26:35.536
<i>I feel like a new man.</i>

26:35.570 --> 26:37.271
Fuck, yes.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.775
Mr. Vanderwick is walking
tall, motherfucker.

26:43.245 --> 26:45.881
- You look great.
- I know.

26:48.685 --> 26:51.154
<i>He says he'll take you to Pittsburgh.</i>

26:51.189 --> 26:53.957
Then you can make your
own way from there.

26:53.991 --> 26:58.261
Here.
That's 2,500 bucks.

26:58.296 --> 27:00.863
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

27:00.897 --> 27:04.667
And, uh, thanks for my new wardrobe.

27:04.702 --> 27:07.936
Yeah.
All right.

27:08.972 --> 27:10.907
- All right.
- Been great, man.

27:10.941 --> 27:15.912
- Thanks.
- Hey, Wicks.

27:17.315 --> 27:19.415
Don't come back.

27:39.774 --> 27:41.275
Morning, Reverend.

27:41.309 --> 27:44.244
No, no, no, no.
Look, you can just turn right around.

27:44.278 --> 27:47.447
<i>I'm not signing.
I've spoken to my lawyer.</i>

27:47.482 --> 27:49.716
He said what you're doing
is considered extortion.

27:49.750 --> 27:53.153
I assure you that was not the case.

27:54.355 --> 27:58.324
- What's this?
- This? This is extortion.

28:00.728 --> 28:04.498
This is... this is not my wife.

28:04.532 --> 28:08.100
<i>Oh? Oh, no, it's her.
It's her, all right.</i>

28:08.135 --> 28:11.038
<i>I should know. See?</i>

28:11.072 --> 28:12.873
I never forget a great piece of ass.

28:12.907 --> 28:14.541
<i>Where did you get these?</i>

28:14.575 --> 28:17.512
Oh, I didn't get them. I took them.

28:17.546 --> 28:20.381
Yeah, I took that one, too.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.083
You fucked my wife?!

28:22.117 --> 28:25.186
Of course not.
She wasn't your wife then.

28:25.220 --> 28:29.257
She danced in my clubs for years
before she found you... and God.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.859
Or was it God, then you?
I don't know.

28:31.894 --> 28:34.229
Either way, I found her first.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.064
<i>- Arthur...
- Shut up.</i>

28:36.098 --> 28:39.567
- Let me... listen to me...
- I said shut up!

28:39.602 --> 28:44.572
But my offer still stands.
I'll double the payout.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.941
As far as I'm concerned,
you've earned it.

28:48.009 --> 28:50.343
At least one of you did.

28:51.613 --> 28:54.315
<i>- I'm so sorry.</i>
- Just sign the papers.

28:54.349 --> 29:00.889
We'll relocate you and
these pictures disappear.

29:02.090 --> 29:05.010
Now, if you don't sign, tomorrow
morning they'll be in the in-boxes

29:05.310 --> 29:08.229
of every member of your church
along with the link to the video.

29:08.297 --> 29:10.232
Video?

29:10.266 --> 29:13.234
Oh, come on, Ramsey.
There's always a video.

29:14.737 --> 29:18.240
- Shut up.
- Dude, you know you like her.

29:18.274 --> 29:20.208
You don't know what
you're talking about.

29:20.276 --> 29:24.046
- Dude, she kisses her dog.
- She does not.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.547
Like, tongue kisses.

29:29.786 --> 29:30.718
Max.

29:33.687 --> 29:34.953
Max!

29:36.656 --> 29:38.691
<i>Max.</i>

29:40.026 --> 29:42.226
Mrs. Hopewell!

29:42.294 --> 29:45.631
<i>Mrs. Hopewell!
Max. Max.</i>

29:45.665 --> 29:48.633
<i>Come on, baby boy.</i>

29:48.668 --> 29:50.803
<i>It's fine. Mommy's right here.</i>

29:52.138 --> 29:55.074
<i>Mommy loves you.</i>

29:55.108 --> 29:57.244
- Hey, how is he?
- Where were you?

29:57.278 --> 29:59.546
- I called you over an hour ago.
- I was in court.

29:59.580 --> 30:03.150
They had to come and
get me. I'm... I'm sorry.

30:03.184 --> 30:05.752
<i>What did the Doctor say?</i>

30:05.786 --> 30:07.787
They haven't said anything yet.

30:10.024 --> 30:15.262
Gordon, Carrie.
He's stable now.

30:15.296 --> 30:18.164
Can we speak privately for a minute?

30:18.198 --> 30:22.135
- I'm not a child.
- Right here's fine, Doctor.

30:23.504 --> 30:27.307
<i>We'd been hoping that the
therapies we had Max on</i>

30:27.341 --> 30:29.342
<i>would keep his lungs
going for a few more years</i>

30:29.377 --> 30:31.244
<i>until he reached puberty,</i>

30:31.278 --> 30:34.948
at which point surgery would
be a more viable option.

30:34.982 --> 30:39.920
But his asthma is being
complicated by that scarred lung

30:39.954 --> 30:43.023
and I don't think we can
take that approach anymore.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.173
<i> Give me that fuckin' money! </i>

32:08.147 --> 32:10.048
You're the lucky man.

32:13.820 --> 32:15.253
Oh.

32:15.287 --> 32:17.955
500, yo.

32:20.293 --> 32:23.094
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

32:23.128 --> 32:25.463
- Whoo!
- I need another fuckin' drink!

32:25.498 --> 32:28.266
- Oh.
- Whoo!

32:31.336 --> 32:34.472
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, lucky nine.

32:34.506 --> 32:35.573
Motherfucker!

32:35.607 --> 32:38.243
<i>Yeah, sonn' bitch! Pay me!</i>

32:45.052 --> 32:48.921
<i>Bet is midnight.
Bet is boxcars.</i>

32:48.955 --> 32:51.758
<i>All right, hands off the layout, please.</i>

32:53.226 --> 32:55.595
<i>The dice are out. Seven.</i>

32:55.629 --> 32:57.097
<i>Craps.</i>

32:57.131 --> 33:00.800
Shit, shit, shit.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.135
- Shit, shit.
- Come on, baby.

33:02.169 --> 33:04.437
- You should really stop.
- No, no, no. I got this.

33:04.472 --> 33:06.239
- You're gonna lose it all.
- Fuck off!

33:06.273 --> 33:09.075
- Hey, man.
- Yeah? Fuck you, too.

33:09.110 --> 33:10.510
Where the fuck are you going?

33:10.545 --> 33:12.145
- Come here.
- You're being an asshole.

33:12.180 --> 33:15.149
Take your hands off the lady now.

33:15.183 --> 33:17.250
Yeah, dickwad, take
your hands off the lady.

33:17.285 --> 33:18.618
- All right, all right.
- Thank you.

33:18.653 --> 33:22.456
Everybody calm down.
It's good, it's good.

33:28.130 --> 33:29.764
<i>Get up, ass-wipe.</i>

33:32.771 --> 33:34.705
Hey, free money!

33:42.047 --> 33:45.016
Who's the ass-wipe now, motherfucker?

33:46.985 --> 33:49.654
Who's the ass-wipe now?
Oh, shit.

34:04.602 --> 34:07.170
<i>Not a fuckin' word.</i>

34:19.483 --> 34:21.817
So this is the guy
who tore up my casino?

34:21.851 --> 34:25.021
It was all a misunderstanding, Chief.

34:25.054 --> 34:27.255
Did you really just call me "Chief"?

34:27.291 --> 34:31.194
- Are you really that fucking dumb?
- I... I didn't mean anything by it.

34:31.228 --> 34:34.630
Shut up and listen so there's
no further misunderstandings.

34:34.665 --> 34:37.467
If you ever walk
through my doors again,

34:37.502 --> 34:40.870
we won't bother the Banshee Sheriff's
Department with our troubles.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.040
This is Kinaho land you're standing on,

34:43.074 --> 34:45.708
and we'd be well within our
rights to handle it internally.

34:45.743 --> 34:48.311
Nod if you understand.

34:51.581 --> 34:56.587
- He's all yours.
- Thanks.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.894
- Here, babe.
- Shit.

35:04.928 --> 35:08.197
- Jesus Christ, Carrie.
- I'm sorry.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.366
- No, no. Leave it, leave it.
- Let me get it.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.736
I got it...
I got it, honey. I got it.

35:24.814 --> 35:29.551
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.829
Max will be okay.
They'll figure this thing out.

35:40.863 --> 35:46.435
They have it figured out.
We just don't want to believe them.

35:47.570 --> 35:52.842
You know, the asthma's one thing,
but he's gonna need a new lung.

35:55.479 --> 35:58.514
He had a bad attack.
I know that, but...

36:08.492 --> 36:14.130
You know, so long as we're here
for the night, why don't we just...

36:14.164 --> 36:17.333
why don't we just get
everything out on the table?

36:19.203 --> 36:22.438
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know,

36:22.473 --> 36:24.140
but I know it's something.

36:24.208 --> 36:28.511
- Max is getting worse.
- I'm not talking about Max.

36:28.546 --> 36:31.915
Honey, I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about you.

36:31.950 --> 36:33.483
When I catch you sitting in the kitchen,

36:33.518 --> 36:35.885
staring out the window,
and the look in your eye,

36:35.919 --> 36:40.056
it's like this look of total despair.

36:40.090 --> 36:43.427
- And the kids are picking up on it, too.
- The ki... what do you mean, the kids?

36:43.461 --> 36:47.230
Deva has asked me more than once
why you seem so distant.

36:51.703 --> 36:56.940
Did you tell her that
seeing the man who...

36:56.974 --> 37:00.645
tried to rape me shot
and killed on top of me

37:00.679 --> 37:02.746
might be a reason for me
to feel a little bit thrown?

37:02.781 --> 37:03.947
I did. I said exac...

37:03.981 --> 37:06.350
- You just...
- Yeah, I said exactly that.

37:07.285 --> 37:09.152
Okay, good.

37:15.593 --> 37:17.894
Tell me about the Sheriff.

37:38.818 --> 37:43.021
<i>He got Deva out of that
rave and I'm very grateful.</i>

37:45.124 --> 37:47.225
<i>And that is it.</i>

37:55.336 --> 37:58.071
<i>I need you to let me in, Carrie.</i>

37:58.105 --> 38:00.408
We can beat this thing with Max.

38:00.442 --> 38:03.476
I know we can, but we have to
be operating at full strength.

38:03.511 --> 38:08.214
- And... and right now...
- You're right. You're right.

38:08.249 --> 38:09.816
Have I done something to upset you?

38:09.850 --> 38:13.987
- Because if I have, I don't know...
- No, honey, no.

38:14.055 --> 38:19.760
It's all me.
I'm just having...

38:19.794 --> 38:22.762
I've been having a hard time
finding my balance right now.

38:22.796 --> 38:25.165
What can I do for you?

38:25.199 --> 38:28.267
Don't give up on me.

38:36.544 --> 38:40.145
Ah.
Thank you, brother.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.016
That is some choice sirloin.
You know your cuts.

38:43.050 --> 38:47.855
- Thank you.
- Mm-mm, thank you.

38:47.889 --> 38:50.123
You got yourself a sweet setup here.

38:50.157 --> 38:54.127
Most cons I know can't get minimum wage.

38:54.162 --> 38:59.232
Look at you... sole proprietor.

38:59.266 --> 39:03.270
What is it about this town?
It's like heaven for cons.

39:06.241 --> 39:09.176
Hey, man! Where you been?

39:09.211 --> 39:12.647
Well, I had to make sure your
mess was cleaned up properly. Thanks.

39:12.681 --> 39:16.417
Yeah, look, I'm real sorry about that, man.

39:16.452 --> 39:17.953
That was my bad.

39:17.988 --> 39:21.123
But in my defense, that
hooker gave me some bad coke.

39:26.262 --> 39:28.830
I told you not to come back.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.401
Yeah, well, you know what?

39:33.436 --> 39:37.172
I believe the power dynamic
here's all fucked up.

39:37.206 --> 39:44.111
- Come again?
- I mean, knowledge is power, right?

39:44.146 --> 39:47.349
I have some knowledge about you
that nobody else in this town has.

39:47.383 --> 39:50.885
<i>So, the way I see it, I'm not the
one who should be taking orders.</i>

39:50.919 --> 39:54.389
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

39:54.424 --> 39:56.991
And we're renegotiating.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.664
- Wicks...
- Listen.

40:02.698 --> 40:05.533
You got a great situation here.

40:05.567 --> 40:10.604
I'm not looking to fuck it up,
but you better believe I want a piece.

40:12.006 --> 40:14.674
Been on the road for two years.

40:14.708 --> 40:20.346
And nothing... I mean
nothing has panned out.

40:20.380 --> 40:23.048
You give me some fuckin'
hush money, send me on my way.

40:23.082 --> 40:25.017
We both know I'm gonna
end up back inside.

40:25.052 --> 40:30.023
And you know what?
I'm not going back.

40:30.057 --> 40:33.993
This is my only play, and I'm making it.

40:36.164 --> 40:39.099
<i>I'm not asking for a handout.</i>

40:40.101 --> 40:44.438
<i>You're gonna give me a chance
and I'm gonna earn my keep.</i>

40:44.472 --> 40:49.143
And that's how it's gonna be, Sheriff.

40:50.311 --> 40:53.114
<i>Man, this is some fucking grade-A beef.</i>

41:03.825 --> 41:06.761
<i>Well, well, well, look who's back.</i>

41:08.997 --> 41:11.433
Got a special delivery for you.

41:20.276 --> 41:22.911
He's coming for you
tomorrow in the yard.

41:24.980 --> 41:29.117
<i>Watch the yard guards.
When they disappear, it's time.</i>

41:30.986 --> 41:32.753
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

41:32.788 --> 41:37.758
I consider it an investment.
It's a long stretch in here.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.502
<i>You only get one chance.</i>

42:15.900 --> 42:19.538
The sky is always bluer than I remember.

42:21.741 --> 42:23.909
I've been waiting for you, my friend.

42:25.311 --> 42:29.982
What you did to Billy B,
that was uncalled for.

42:30.016 --> 42:32.317
That was a hate crime, man.

42:32.385 --> 42:34.486
<i>Bring him.</i>

42:38.224 --> 42:39.591
Come on, tough guy.

42:44.897 --> 42:47.032
Nice try, smart-ass.

42:57.309 --> 42:58.744
<i>Get on your fucking knees.</i>

42:58.778 --> 43:02.047
Get on your fucking knees, bitch!

43:18.566 --> 43:20.566
Ask for it.

43:21.902 --> 43:23.803
What?

43:27.073 --> 43:28.908
Ask for it.

43:35.316 --> 43:37.484
Whoa.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.956
Okay, so...

43:42.991 --> 43:46.827
I do this...
and we're good?

43:48.330 --> 43:53.501
Fuck, no.
I'll probably still kill you.

43:56.337 --> 44:02.910
But if you show some serious skills,
you may have a future.

44:17.295 --> 44:22.834
I'd better come quick and hard,
or you won't stand up again.

44:24.903 --> 44:27.137
Now ask for it.

44:28.005 --> 44:29.740
Okay.

44:31.176 --> 44:33.510
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
- What?

44:35.180 --> 44:37.314
Give it to me.

45:21.357 --> 45:23.459
Motherfucker!

47:46.740 --> 47:48.806
Are we good?

47:51.511 --> 47:54.045
Yeah, we're good.

47:56.681 --> 47:59.617
<i>I knew guys like Wicks in prison,</i>

47:59.651 --> 48:03.554
guys that never stop
digging graves for themselves

48:03.588 --> 48:07.657
and then trading everything and
everyone to keep from getting buried.

48:07.691 --> 48:10.160
Eh, Hood, I never saw the paperwork

48:10.194 --> 48:15.266
on that Leonard Vanderwick guy.
<i>That get filed or...?</i>

48:15.300 --> 48:18.502
It wasn't worth the effort.
I sent him packing.

48:18.536 --> 48:21.272
Guys like that don't go down

48:21.306 --> 48:24.809
without taking everyone
close down with him.

48:24.843 --> 48:26.877
That's their game.

48:26.913 --> 48:29.147
<i>How did he know you anyway?</i>

48:29.181 --> 48:30.848
He didn't.

48:32.184 --> 48:35.219
Not really.

48:35.287 --> 48:40.558
- Knew of me, I guess.
- And you just... just let him go?

48:40.593 --> 48:42.527
<i>Yeah.</i>

48:42.561 --> 48:46.197
I didn't want to waste any more time on
a vagrant who tried to steal some dinner.

48:46.231 --> 48:49.032
So now you decide which
laws are worth enforcing?

48:50.368 --> 48:53.036
That's why they gave me the badge.

48:53.070 --> 48:59.676
- Yeah, but the rules are different out here.
- No. Same rules.

48:59.710 --> 49:03.013
Same rules they had since the
first man picked up the first stick

49:03.048 --> 49:05.782
and beat the second man's ass with it.

49:10.789 --> 49:12.757
You have an interesting
way of looking at the world.

49:14.459 --> 49:17.495
<i>Yeah, I've lived an interesting life.</i>

49:34.026 --> 49:37.749
<i>- Yes?
- Tell him it's me.</i>

49:37.784 --> 49:39.686
It's her.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.195
<i>Anastasia.</i>

49:50.731 --> 49:52.832
I'm ready...

49:54.401 --> 49:56.269
to bring him to you.

49:57.972 --> 50:01.842
- When?
- By the end of this week.

50:03.979 --> 50:05.612
<i>Where?</i>

50:11.119 --> 50:13.286
I'll let you know.

50:21.463 --> 50:23.630
She will bring him.

50:43.752 --> 50:46.421
<i>And just when things finally</i>

50:46.455 --> 50:50.659
seem to be nice and
boring, you came along.

50:50.693 --> 50:52.694
You're welcome.

50:56.466 --> 50:58.900
I guess I'm just not cut out for...

51:01.737 --> 51:04.339
boring.

51:42.632 --> 51:45.350

<i>I got your message.</i>

52:51.587 --> 52:53.387
<i>I know we haven't talked in a long time,</i>

52:53.421 --> 52:55.824
<i>but I've got some real trouble here.</i>

52:55.858 --> 52:58.492
<i>I called a few times and I
haven't heard back from you.</i>

52:58.527 --> 53:01.561
<i>I just wish I knew
where the hell you were.</i>

53:01.596 --> 53:04.565
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

53:04.599 --> 53:07.869
<i>Anyway, please call me. Bye.</i>
