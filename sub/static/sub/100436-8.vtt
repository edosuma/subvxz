WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.832
- Peralta, you need
to come with me right now.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.356
- Can I eat my bagel?

00:08.399 --> 00:10.793
- Trust me, you're not gonna
wanna eat before you see this.

00:10.836 --> 00:13.404
That's Shane Reed.
Suspect in a string of B&Es.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.538
Got pulled over this morning.
This was in his trunk.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.844
- Son of a bitch!

00:18.888 --> 00:21.021
- Peralta...Peralta, calm down.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.414
- Why am I here?
I didn't do anything.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.155
- You broke into
15 houses, Shane,

00:25.199 --> 00:26.678
but that's not what
I care about right now.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.550
All I care about is what
we found in your car.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.204
- I don't understand.
- He doesn't understand, Diaz.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.727
Why don't you fill him in?

00:31.770 --> 00:33.337
- "You are invited
to celebrate the wedding

00:33.381 --> 00:35.383
of Katherine Joyner
and Douglas Judy."

00:35.426 --> 00:37.863
Douglas Judy, AKA Doug Judy,

00:37.907 --> 00:39.865
AKA, the Pontiac Bandit.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.389
- Maybe.
- That's a yes.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.086
Now tell me, Shane,
when did you get the invite?

00:43.130 --> 00:44.566
- What?

00:44.609 --> 00:45.915
- When did you receive
the invite in the mail

00:45.958 --> 00:47.308
and how come I didn't get one?

00:47.351 --> 00:49.179
- Why would you get an invite?
Do you know Doug?

00:49.223 --> 00:50.702
- Hey, I'm the one
asking the questions here!

00:50.746 --> 00:53.227
- Calm down, Jake.
Maybe it's a small wedding.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.968
- Okay, good point.
How big is the venue, Shane?

00:56.012 --> 00:57.231
I said how big is the venue?

00:57.274 --> 00:58.710
- I--I--I don't know!

00:58.754 --> 01:00.495
- I--I--I--I don't know!
But I bet you do know

01:00.538 --> 01:01.887
the password to the wedding
website, don't you?

01:01.931 --> 01:03.367
- Yeah, I guess.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.934
- Well, then I guess you
better tell it to me, Shane.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.109
You wash my back,
I'll wash yours.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.719
- Wash?
- I meant scratch.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.286
You know I meant scratch.
Now tell me the password.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.375
- I think it's
"dougandkateforever."

01:11.419 --> 01:13.812
- There, was that
so hard, Shane?

01:13.856 --> 01:15.249
You did the right thing.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.729
Now get this piece
of trash out of my sight.

01:18.817 --> 01:22.691
Oh, is forever spelled out,
or is it the number four?

01:22.734 --> 01:24.345
- Oh, it's spelled out.
- Okay, thank you so much.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.390
Now get this piece
of trash out of my sight!

01:46.454 --> 01:48.456
- I'm so glad you called.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.588
Thanks for meeting me at
my favorite establishment.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.373
- A place where
you paint pottery?

01:52.416 --> 01:53.722
- I find a hand-painted mug

01:53.765 --> 01:55.506
makes a thoughtful
gift for any occasion.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.161
- So, what's going on?
Anything exciting in your life

01:58.205 --> 01:59.641
that you maybe want
to tell me about?

01:59.684 --> 02:01.904
- I got a new job.
I sit behind white CEOs

02:01.947 --> 02:03.384
when they have
to testify before Congress,

02:03.427 --> 02:04.907
so they don't look so racist.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.431
Every 15 minutes I just
whisper some nonsense at 'em.

02:07.475 --> 02:11.087
The texture
of quiche is unsettling.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.177
I got paid $75,000
for that nonsense.

02:14.221 --> 02:17.180
- That's cool, congratulations.
But there's nothing else,

02:17.224 --> 02:18.442
you know,
maybe even more interesting

02:18.486 --> 02:19.748
that you want to fill me in on?

02:19.791 --> 02:21.619
- It seemed like
a pretty cool fact to me.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.273
- All right, look Judy,
I know you're getting married.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.275
- Damn it, I didn't think
you'd find out about that.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.582
Who told you, Ronnie?
Bobby?

02:27.625 --> 02:28.974
Ricky?
Mike?

02:29.018 --> 02:30.454
- Don't try and change
the subject by tricking me

02:30.498 --> 02:31.760
into singing
New Edition with you.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.240
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.980
Ronnie, Bobby,
Ricky and Mike...

02:35.024 --> 02:37.026
both: ♪ If I like the girl
who cares who you like ♪

02:37.069 --> 02:38.680
- Whoo!
- So all is forgiven?

02:38.723 --> 02:40.421
- No!
Why didn't you invite me?

02:40.464 --> 02:42.814
- I wanted to, but a lot
of people in my life are crooks

02:42.858 --> 02:44.903
and they think it's weird
that I'm friends with a cop.

02:44.947 --> 02:48.211
They just don't understand.
Kind of like...parents?

02:48.255 --> 02:49.691
- No, no more songs.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.823
- Look, I'm having my
Bachelor party tomorrow night

02:51.867 --> 02:54.086
and I want you to be there.
We'll make up a criminal alias

02:54.130 --> 02:55.392
for you so you
can meet the boys.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.698
- Obviously that's
a super cool plan,

02:56.741 --> 02:58.439
but no, I don't want your pity.

02:58.482 --> 03:03.052
- Suit yourself, but it's
gonna be one sexy-ass weekend.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.967
- Like...

03:05.707 --> 03:07.535
How sexy-ass
are we talking here?

03:07.578 --> 03:10.407
- Private jet to Miami, baby!
- And there's a red carpet!

03:10.451 --> 03:12.235
- Forget the red carpet.
Private jet!

03:12.279 --> 03:14.019
- Yes, and a jet!
The jet is better.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.543
Miami, here we come!

03:15.586 --> 03:16.892
- Whoo!

03:16.935 --> 03:18.285
- Today is Holt's first day

03:18.328 --> 03:20.330
back in his office
and I wanna make sure

03:20.374 --> 03:21.940
everything is just
how he left it.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.378
Now, I can't remember,
was this little figurine

03:24.421 --> 03:28.208
of Cheddar at a 45
or 50 degree angle?

03:28.251 --> 03:30.079
- Terry,
it's a five degree difference.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.081
You better figure it out.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.431
- Ah, I missed this place.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.216
Huh, little Cheddar's askew.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.044
You really made yourself
at home, didn't you Jeffords?

03:39.088 --> 03:40.872
But, uh...no matter.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.526
Just glad to be here.

03:42.570 --> 03:46.487
I am a captain again.
Back where I belong.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.577
Everything is perfect.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.056
Wow...

03:51.100 --> 03:53.885
there's absolutely nothing
that could puncture my...

03:53.929 --> 03:56.279
where's the business card?
- What?

03:56.323 --> 03:57.889
- The business card
that was right here.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.240
It had a piece of gum on it.
It's very important to me.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.545
You didn't throw it away,
did you?

04:01.589 --> 04:03.112
No, Terry would never

04:03.155 --> 04:05.288
throw away something
that looked exactly like trash.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.768
- Good.
I'll be back in half an hour.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.204
Make sure it's
on my desk by then.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.293
- Will do, sir.
I got it.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.512
I'm on it.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.731
I definitely threw it away.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.516
- I want you to meet the guys.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.387
This is Nathan,
Josh, and Chuck.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.475
This is my buddy,
Sean, from prison.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.868
- How's it going, fellas?

04:19.911 --> 04:21.478
- I've never heard
you mention Sean before.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.219
- Yeah, well like he said,
I just got out of jail.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.438
Five years.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.743
- Tough sentence.
What'd you do?

04:25.787 --> 04:28.311
- Elder abuse.
Got my grandpa good, so...

04:28.355 --> 04:29.921
- Damn, that's very upsetting.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.096
- Damn straight it is.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.359
- Elder abuse?

04:32.402 --> 04:33.621
- I was trying to think
of something that

04:33.664 --> 04:35.318
wouldn't inspire any
follow-up questions.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.928
- Doug Judy!

04:36.972 --> 04:39.191
- Cubes!
My man.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.932
Sean, I'd like you to meet

04:40.976 --> 04:43.413
the man whose private jet
we are flying on today.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.675
- Yeah, you're Mark Cuban.

04:44.719 --> 04:45.763
How do you guys
know each other?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.287
- Doug came on "Shark Tank"

04:47.330 --> 04:48.984
to pitch his idea
for the Smush Shush.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.421
- It's a noise-cancelling
blanket for secret sex.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.902
The product demonstration
did not go well.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.947
- Robert fainted.
Anyway, enjoy the jet.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.601
Just bring it back
in one piece, okay?

04:57.645 --> 04:58.689
- No promises, Mark Cuban.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.082
- I mean, we do wanna make sure

05:00.125 --> 05:01.910
the airplane stays
in one piece though, right?

05:01.953 --> 05:03.477
- Nah, I saw, "Flight."
If anything goes wrong,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.087
fly the plane upside down.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.654
- Oh, right, I forgot about
"Flight," the movie, "Flight."

05:06.697 --> 05:08.525
All right, let's rip it up!

05:08.569 --> 05:11.354
- What's going on here?
- Oh, measuring the space.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.660
We finally got a work order

05:12.703 --> 05:14.488
approved to fix
the outlet, so...

05:14.531 --> 05:16.272
we can get
a third vending machine.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.404
- What?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.014
- A third vending machine.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.668
- Why are you whispering about
getting a new vending machine?

05:20.711 --> 05:22.104
- New vending machine!
- What model number?

05:22.147 --> 05:23.366
- Oh, that's why.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.498
- We asked you
what model number.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.151
- I don't know, a normal one

05:26.195 --> 05:27.457
with glass in the front.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.067
- Seriously?
Did you even look into

05:29.111 --> 05:30.634
the DiGiSnax 600E?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.593
- I'd be into
a fancy machine, too.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.595
I was just reading
about a Japanese one

05:34.638 --> 05:36.379
that serves shellfish.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.859
- We're not getting
a shellfish machine.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.730
- Yeah, Boyle,
we're getting a smart machine

05:39.774 --> 05:41.993
that suggests soda pairings
based on your chip choice.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.648
- Or one with a make-it-wet
gravy feature!

05:44.692 --> 05:46.650
- Okay, look.
Why don't you get a few options

05:46.694 --> 05:48.652
together and then
I'll decide, okay?

05:48.696 --> 05:50.045
At least Terry's not here

05:50.088 --> 05:51.351
to try to make me
get a yogurt machine.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.178
- What was that about yogurt?

05:53.222 --> 05:54.832
- This jet is insane.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.921
There's a private chef that'll
make anything you ask for,

05:56.965 --> 05:58.270
no matter how expensive.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.924
I just ordered
lobster enchanté.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.578
- Oh, damn, what's that?
- I don't know.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.927
I just said the fanciest
words I could think of.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.103
- Oh, I'm gonna get
the Veal Prime Minister.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.409
- Mm, that sounds good.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.106
- Hey, you wanna
try out the Smush Shush?

06:08.150 --> 06:09.804
- What?
You have one with you?

06:09.847 --> 06:12.328
- I take it everywhere, baby.
- Yeah, there it is.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.069
- Yeah.
- So it's noise canceling?

06:15.505 --> 06:17.681
It's so heavy.
It's crushing my bones.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.900
- Yeah, that was the Shark's
problem with it, too.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.205
- I can't breathe.
Get it off me.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.729
Get it off me.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.513
- Yeah, you sound exactly
like Barbara right now.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.428
- Disappointed in you, Jake.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.864
- Pilot says we're
starting our descent.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.562
- Then let's get changed, boys!
- Changed?

06:28.605 --> 06:29.867
But these are
my coolest clothes.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.391
I got them from
a targeted Instagram ad

06:31.434 --> 06:32.827
after looking
at photos of Cam Newton.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.437
- The outfit's beautiful,
but it doesn't really

06:34.481 --> 06:36.047
say, "Miami."

06:36.091 --> 06:38.049
- What does say, "Miami?"

06:38.093 --> 06:40.356
- ♪ Come on, shake your body
baby do the conga ♪

06:40.400 --> 06:42.358
♪ I know you can't control
yourself any longer ♪

06:42.402 --> 06:44.491
♪ Feel the rhythm of
the music getting stronger ♪

06:44.534 --> 06:47.232
♪ Don't you fight it 'til you
tried it, do that conga beat ♪

06:47.276 --> 06:49.409
- Are you sure this
is culturally okay for me?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.498
- We're gonna find out.
- All right.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.717
- ♪ Come on, shake your body
baby do that conga ♪

06:53.761 --> 06:55.632
- Damn, Judy,
this place is nice.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.721
- Yeah, some Russian oligarch
got the penthouse,

06:57.765 --> 06:59.723
but this is
the second nicest room.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.247
- Surprise!
- Trudy Judy!

07:02.291 --> 07:03.988
What you doing here?
I thought you were in prison!

07:04.032 --> 07:06.077
- Nope, I was a real
sweet pea, so they let me out

07:06.121 --> 07:07.818
for good behavior.
What the hell?

07:07.862 --> 07:10.560
What's this NARC doing here?

07:18.612 --> 07:21.092
- What the hell was that?
You almost blew my cover.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.616
- Yeah, they're
all suspicious now.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.269
You have to help us convince
them that Jake's not a cop.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.445
- Why? I don't understand
why you invited him.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.707
This was supposed to be a crazy

07:26.750 --> 07:28.012
weekend of boobs and butts.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.100
- Trudy Judy,
you're not gonna see

07:29.144 --> 07:30.493
boobs or butts this weekend.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.234
- I'll see butts
if I wanna see butts.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.627
- And Jake is here
because he's my friend

07:33.670 --> 07:35.106
and he really wanted to come.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.891
- No, he's up to something.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.370
He's probably here
to arrest Chuck.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.155
- I would never arrest Chuck--
but, I mean,

07:40.198 --> 07:41.330
why'd you say that?
What did Chuck do?

07:41.373 --> 07:43.941
- Wow...cops always be copping.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.508
- That's not true.
I do bad things.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.554
One time I illegally
downloaded an O-Town album!

07:47.597 --> 07:49.251
- Dang, that's one
of the hardest boy bands.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.514
- Exactly, they're scary.
Look, I can be cool.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.647
As long as nobody commits any
major crimes in front of me.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.953
- It's not a problem.
We don't have to break the law

07:55.997 --> 07:57.520
to have fun.
We gonna have some drinks,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.435
smoke some Cubans,
eat a steak, either crazy big

07:59.479 --> 08:01.698
or crazy small,
whichever's more expensive.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.221
- I'd rather see butts.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.310
- Fine, if I let you see butts,

08:05.354 --> 08:07.225
will you convince the guys
that Jake's not a cop?

08:07.269 --> 08:08.270
- How many butts
are we talking?

08:08.313 --> 08:09.271
- Six.
- Ten.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.533
- Seven.
- Nine.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.274
- Fine, eight,
I'll meet you in the middle.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.536
- Nah, you waited too long.
Now it's up to 14.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.277
- 14 butts!
- She's a grown woman.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.757
Just let her see butts, man.
- Thank you, Jake.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.585
Thank you for coming
to my aid on the butt thing.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.891
One step closer to trust.
Now I'ma go out there and help

08:20.935 --> 08:22.763
your fedora-wearing
Jason Mraz-looking ass, okay?

08:22.806 --> 08:24.591
- I think I look like
Andy Garcia in this hat.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.114
- You look like Seth Green.
- Seth Green?

08:26.157 --> 08:27.724
- No, Tom Green.
- Tom Green.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.596
- You're thinking of Tom Green.
- Tom Green?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.467
No, go back to Jason Mraz.

08:31.511 --> 08:35.819
- Okay, so Holt's gum-covered
business card is long gone.

08:35.863 --> 08:36.994
But I have a plan.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.605
- Great, what's the scheme?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.650
- Well, when I first moved in,
I took a couple selfies

08:40.694 --> 08:43.131
to commemorate
getting my own office.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.220
- A couple?
- Oh, please.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.700
Like you don't
have any selfies.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.006
Let me see your camera roll.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.835
Zero photos?
That's so much weirder!

08:51.879 --> 08:53.576
- Thank you.
- Anyway, look.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.579
If you zoom in enough,
you can see the business card.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.799
We can recreate it
and print a new one!

08:58.842 --> 09:00.540
- Wait, does that
say "Zeff Wilcox"?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.585
- Zeff?
No, it's probably Jeff.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
You know,
like a normal human name.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.719
- Names are all made up.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.634
There's no such
thing as a normal name.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.983
"Terry."

09:09.026 --> 09:10.724
- I am not putting
"Zeff" on that card.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.986
- It's your funeral.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.248
- Have you found
my business card?

09:13.291 --> 09:15.076
- Uh...you know what,

09:15.119 --> 09:17.295
I actually brought
it home by accident.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.385
I got confused because
I know someone with that name.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.301
- You know another Zeff?

09:23.345 --> 09:26.609
- Yeah, he's married
to Sharon's friend, Zudy.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.829
We have dinner with
Zeff and Zudy once a month.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.482
You know, I'm gonna
go home and get it.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.615
Excuse me.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.531
- I think they swing.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.229
- So in the end, it's more
than a vending machine.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.405
It's a vending experience.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.539
- A vending experience that
serves fried octopus balls?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.021
- It also serves eel balls
and clam balls and...

09:47.064 --> 09:49.110
it's really just
the three kinds of balls.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.460
- Oh, okay.
On that horrifying note,

09:51.503 --> 09:53.505
Scully and Hitchcock,
it's your turn.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.160
- Allow me to introduce
you to the Q3400.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.032
She's got it all.
Chips, candy, soda,

09:58.075 --> 09:59.555
and a whole lot of class.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.079
- That sounds great
for snacking, but what if

10:02.123 --> 10:03.690
I'm stuck working late
at the office?

10:03.733 --> 10:06.040
- How about a personal-sized
frozen pizza?

10:06.083 --> 10:07.694
- And then what?
I have to carry it

10:07.737 --> 10:10.305
all the way over to
the microwave on my own?

10:10.348 --> 10:11.915
Who has the time?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.351
- Well, you're
in luck, because...

10:13.395 --> 10:15.353
- I get it!
It cooks the pizza for you.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.834
- It cooks the pizza for you.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.227
both:
♪ And you know

10:19.270 --> 10:20.358
- ♪ It ain't fiction

10:20.402 --> 10:22.230
- ♪ Just a natural fact

10:22.273 --> 10:24.406
- ♪ Ooh
We come together ♪

10:24.449 --> 10:30.281
both:
♪ 'Cause opposites attract

10:32.066 --> 10:33.502
- No applause?
Wow.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.025
- I'm still just
a little confused.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.287
Who is Sean, really?

10:36.331 --> 10:37.462
Why'd your sister
say he was a NARC?

10:37.506 --> 10:38.725
Is he a cop?
- He's not a cop.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.204
He caught me
cheating on my boyfriend

10:40.248 --> 10:42.337
and he snitched.
It was a real dick move,

10:42.380 --> 10:43.643
but I have since forgiven him.

10:43.686 --> 10:44.905
- It's just weird
that none of us have

10:44.948 --> 10:46.254
ever heard of him before.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.734
- And we're paranoid
because Doug still has

10:47.777 --> 10:49.126
that copy friend in the NYPD.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.345
- That dude is not my friend.
- Yeah.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.912
- He dumb as hell.
- Yeah.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.609
- I'm always tricking him.
- Well, not every time.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.306
- Plus, he's short.
- Everyone's short to you.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.612
You're a giant.
- Probably never even had sex.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.135
- Seems unlikely.
He's an adult.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.702
But the point is, I'm Sean.
Tall Sean.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.051
- Okay, well I'm glad
to hear you're not a NARC,

11:01.095 --> 11:02.357
'cause it'd have
been real awkward

11:02.400 --> 11:03.663
considering what
we did earlier.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.099
- Huh?

11:05.142 --> 11:06.666
- While you were checking in,
we stole $10 million

11:06.709 --> 11:07.971
worth of diamonds
from that rich Russian dude

11:08.015 --> 11:09.277
in the penthouse!

11:09.320 --> 11:10.495
- Bling, bling, baby!

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
- You idiots.
He's NYPD.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.456
That's Doug's cop friend.

11:14.499 --> 11:19.069
- Wow...way to ruin
Doug's bachelor party, Trudy.

11:19.113 --> 11:22.464
What a buzz kill, right, guys?

11:28.165 --> 11:30.080
- I knew it was
a mistake to invite a cop.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.647
That's why you
should only interact

11:31.691 --> 11:32.735
with people who
are exactly the same as you.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.867
- That's a terrible lesson.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.172
- Sometimes
things aren't lessons.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.913
Sometimes things are
just messed up facts.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.046
- Guys, relax, Jake
wasn't gonna arrest anybody.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.787
- No, I definitely was.
- With what evidence?

11:40.830 --> 11:42.092
The diamonds aren't even here.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.398
- They confessed
right in front of me.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.747
- Why would you pull a heist

11:44.791 --> 11:46.053
in the middle
of my bachelor party?

11:46.096 --> 11:47.663
- You pulled a heist
during my wedding.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.751
- Shh--he's a cop, man.
Come on, chill.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.926
- Judy.
- Come on, guys.

11:49.970 --> 11:50.927
What are we gonna do?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.755
- I say we tie this NARC up,

11:52.799 --> 11:54.017
leave him to starve, and
disappear with the diamonds.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.497
- Chuck.
- We're not doing that.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.933
- Thank you.
- It'll ruin my bachelor party.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.195
- That's your issue with it?

11:58.239 --> 11:59.762
- I put a lot
of work into this weekend.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.068
I got us all shirts
that say, "Doug's Dudes."

12:01.111 --> 12:02.025
- Ooh.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.374
- Sorry,
but what's done is done.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.724
It's not like we can
put the diamonds back.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.377
- Hold up, that's a great idea.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.814
We pull a reverse heist.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.032
Does the Russian know
his diamonds are missing?

12:09.076 --> 12:10.512
- No, we swapped
them for fakes.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.122
- Perfect, that means
he hasn't reported it.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.776
No harm, no foul.
- Okay, wait.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.647
I mean, obviously I love
the premise and I think

12:15.691 --> 12:17.911
a reverse heist would make
for a great movie and I already

12:17.954 --> 12:19.651
have the tag line, "This summer
there are takebacks."

12:19.695 --> 12:21.044
- Love that.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.611
- The poster would be you
and me back-to-back with

12:22.654 --> 12:24.221
our arms crossed, but no,
I'm not onboard with this.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.657
I'm a cop.

12:25.701 --> 12:26.920
- And a cop's job
is to prevent crime

12:26.963 --> 12:28.138
and that's what you'd be doing.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.837
Please, Jake.
For me?

12:31.881 --> 12:34.057
- Okay, fine.
'Cause it's your bachelor party

12:34.101 --> 12:36.103
and only if I see them
put back with my own eyes.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.801
- Yes! Deal.
Reverse heist, baby.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.455
- The Takeback.
Coming this fall to HBO.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.804
- It's a TV show now?

12:41.848 --> 12:44.198
- Well that's where
all the best content is.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.897
- So what do you think?
Which gum looks

12:47.941 --> 12:49.464
the most like the one
from the picture?

12:49.507 --> 12:52.510
- Two pink, too wet, too small,
too chewed, too smooth,

12:52.554 --> 12:53.860
too wet, all wrong, too pink,

12:53.903 --> 12:55.078
too fresh,
too dirty, too clean.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.514
None of these work.
You struck out.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.516
- We don't have any time.
What do we do?

12:58.560 --> 12:59.648
- I don't know.
Pick one and pray.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.477
- Uh...I'm gonna go with...you.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.696
- Not that one.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.437
This one.

13:06.481 --> 13:09.484
- Hmm...it's a little
less pink than I recall.

13:09.527 --> 13:12.835
But I suppose we exaggerate
the beauty of those we love.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.968
It's good to have
you back, old friend.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.839
- Can I ask why that
card is so important?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.885
- Because of Zeff Wilcox.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.017
He was a victim
in the first case I worked.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.063
I always want to remember him.
- That's nice.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.760
- And the words
he wrote on the back.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.501
- The back--say what, now?

13:26.544 --> 13:28.155
- Why is this blank?

13:28.198 --> 13:31.375
- I threw it away.
I thought it was trash.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.334
I didn't know you kept it
to remember someone you helped.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.727
- I didn't help Zeff,
I failed Zeff.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.077
His case was never solved.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.905
The words written
on the back were:

13:38.948 --> 13:40.558
"Thanks for nothing."

13:40.602 --> 13:41.951
- Oh, man, that's rough.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.084
- I have held onto
that card for 30 years

13:44.127 --> 13:45.912
because I always wanted
to remember what it felt like

13:45.955 --> 13:48.088
to let someone down,
so I'd never do it again.

13:48.131 --> 13:51.787
That card made me
the cop I am today.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.270
Without it...I'm lost.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.229
- Since this seems important
now, I want to be clear.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.057
This is Terry's thing, I've
just been along for the ride.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.798
- Rosa!
- Noted.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.104
- So tell us how you stole

14:04.147 --> 14:05.583
the diamonds, so we can
just reverse it.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.020
- Won't work.
We took them from the luggage

14:07.063 --> 14:08.499
downstairs, posing as bellhops.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.892
It was a one-time opportunity.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.111
- And now the fakes
are locked in the safe

14:11.154 --> 14:12.852
in a bodyguard-protected suite.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.898
- Well lucky for you, I have
a long past in heist planning.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.900
It's how I proposed to my wife.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.033
- That's a great story.
Makes me cry every time.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.425
- Oh, thank you.
Well, I guess I'll tell it.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.167
You see, once a year,
at Halloween...

14:24.211 --> 14:25.473
I can tell that
I'm losing the room.

14:25.516 --> 14:26.996
I'll just move on.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.173
So here's how
our thing is gonna go.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.914
Every hotel safe
has an override code,

14:31.958 --> 14:33.611
in case guests
leave them locked.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.049
That code is kept on
the concierge's computer.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.051
Do you know who this is?

14:38.094 --> 14:40.444
This is Matt Daniel,
the most popular

14:40.488 --> 14:42.446
male ASMR performer on Twitch.

14:42.490 --> 14:45.754
- ASMR performer?
- Someone who speaks real soft.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.103
- I also crinkle paper.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.365
- We're trying
to stream and the noise

14:48.409 --> 14:50.237
on the eighth floor
is unacceptable.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.326
- My fans can't
hear my mouth sounds.

14:52.369 --> 14:53.936
- I'm so sorry,
I can't hear you.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.285
- That's the point, Georgina.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.808
- He says that's the point,
Georgina.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.114
This is taking too long.
Make a video.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.073
Tell your
25 million subscribers

15:00.116 --> 15:02.814
to never stay
at this crap hotel.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.120
- No, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.035
Let me talk
to my general manager.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.342
- You better run.
- Matt, don't yell.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.213
You'll strain
your beautiful voice.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.736
- Once we hack
into the computer

15:11.780 --> 15:13.303
and get the override code,

15:13.347 --> 15:15.001
Trudy will put on a
housekeeper's uniform

15:15.044 --> 15:17.525
and I will gracefully
hide in her cart.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.006
I got it myself.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.399
Then, after the Russian
goes out for the night,

15:22.443 --> 15:24.314
Trudy will show up
for turn-down service

15:24.358 --> 15:26.490
and I sneak out when
the guards are distracted by

15:26.534 --> 15:28.710
Trudy's signature
sexy housekeeping.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.627
- Trudy will then exit,
leaving me behind in the suite

15:32.670 --> 15:35.151
so I can unlock the balcony
door for Chuck and Doug,

15:35.195 --> 15:37.414
who are waiting outside
on the window washer's rig.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.286
Chuck will bring the stolen
diamonds and I'll use

15:39.329 --> 15:41.331
the override code to put
them back where they belong.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.726
Then, we head down to the room
where we party like hell.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.252
- Trudy Judy...

15:49.296 --> 15:52.081
- It's exactly 14,
just like you promised.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.954
- You did promise her butts.
- I know.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.695
- Mmm...the smell
of fresh cooked pizza.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.349
- Where are we?
Rome, Italy?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.525
- Guys, you got
the vending machine you wanted.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.397
You can stop with
the play acting.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.876
- I don't think
that's scripted.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.704
That's just them
talking about pizza.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.184
- Yum, yum, yum.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.231
- I shouldn't have pushed
for the fish ball machine.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.015
I should've just played it safe

16:13.059 --> 16:14.538
and gone for
the fish cake machine.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.714
- So you don't think
the fish part was the problem?

16:16.758 --> 16:19.326
- I don't.
- Well, at least they're happy.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.414
Look at 'em.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.722
- My pizza!

16:24.766 --> 16:25.985
- You did it, Peralta.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.464
You pulled off
the reverse heist.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.553
This whole time
I thought you were a bitch...

16:29.597 --> 16:32.295
but truth is,
you're actually that bitch!

16:32.339 --> 16:35.037
- He is, isn't he?
He's that bitch.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.430
- I don't know if I want
that nickname to stick.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.867
- Ooh, I hope
my butts are back.

16:38.910 --> 16:39.999
- I do not like how butts

16:40.042 --> 16:41.391
have become your thing, Trudy.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.263
You used to love horses.
- Horses have butts.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.960
- Guys, it's not butts.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.353
I'm so sorry, Doug.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.484
- Miami PD!

16:47.528 --> 16:48.790
- It's just those
three back there.

16:48.833 --> 16:49.791
- Hand on the table.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.140
- Jake, what the hell?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.360
- Cops always be copping.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.756
- Hey!
Hey there, friends.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.193
I tried to flag down
your taxi as you were leaving

17:00.236 --> 17:01.672
the police station.
It was actually funny,

17:01.716 --> 17:02.673
'cause we made a lot
of eye contact,

17:02.717 --> 17:03.935
but you just drove off.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.546
Anyways, I'm here now.
We can go.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.721
- You want us to take
you back to New York

17:06.764 --> 17:07.983
after you got my
friends arrested?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.376
- Nuh-uh,
you flying commercial, son.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.725
- I hope you get a middle seat.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.074
- I hope they charge
you for your carry-ons.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.771
- I hope you sit next
to someone chatty.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.208
- Someone going through
something real hard.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.992
- I hope the pilot makes
an announcement during

17:17.036 --> 17:18.602
the emotional climax
of the movie you're watching.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.561
- Ooh, you nasty!
- Damn, Doug and Trudy Judy.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.693
Look, I'm sorry,
but it was grand larceny.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.086
I couldn't just let them
get away with it.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.566
- Well if you were
gonna arrest them anyway,

17:25.609 --> 17:26.610
why bother with
the reverse heist?

17:26.654 --> 17:28.177
- It's like Trudy said.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.744
We didn't have the diamonds.
It wasn't enough evidence.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.050
- But we put them back.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.834
- Yeah,
only because I was there.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.227
Not to mention the fact
that I was fully complicit.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.402
I could've gone to jail.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.968
- Wait,
we destroyed your phone.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.796
How did you call for backup?
- That was actually easy.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.711
When Doug was distracted,
yelling at the concierge...

17:40.755 --> 17:42.278
- Let me talk
to my general manager.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.846
- I swapped out my
waterlogged phone for his.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.413
- Damn, I would have noticed
that if I wasn't trying

17:46.456 --> 17:48.458
to live in the moment and
not look at my phone so much.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.808
- And then when I was hidden
in the cart, I called the cops.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.375
- Mm, impossible.
I would've heard you.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.029
- Not with the Smush Shush!

17:54.073 --> 17:56.727
- This is Jake Peralta.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.642
Foot cramp, foot cramp.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.340
- First of all, how dare you!

18:00.383 --> 18:02.603
Second of all,
would you call Barbara Corcoran

18:02.646 --> 18:04.779
and tell her this
product is not useless?

18:04.822 --> 18:07.129
- I don't know her.
I'm sorry that I betrayed you,

18:07.173 --> 18:08.957
Doug, but I'm a cop.
I didn't have a choice.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.351
We can still be friends, right?
- I don't know.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.310
Did you even illegally
download that O-Town album?

18:14.354 --> 18:16.182
- No.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.576
- I bought it at their concert.
Came bundled with a sweatshirt.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.448
- You make me sick.
- Disgusting.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.145
- Doug!

18:23.189 --> 18:24.538
Trudy!

18:24.581 --> 18:26.540
Judy's!

18:26.583 --> 18:28.324
- Hey, sir.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.543
I'm sure you're
still mad at us.

18:29.586 --> 18:30.979
- Just you, not Diaz.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.677
- Okay, well,
I can't get that card back,

18:33.721 --> 18:35.592
but I did bring you these.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.900
They're business cards
of people you've helped.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.772
One mistake did not make
you the cop you are today.

18:41.816 --> 18:44.558
30 years of service
to the community did.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.994
That should be your motivation.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.648
I know you can't
remember their names, but...

18:47.691 --> 18:50.172
- Alex Chen.
I do remember him.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.914
36-year-old male,
carjacked at the corner

18:52.957 --> 18:54.568
of 7th Avenue and 11th Street.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.484
Had three siblings,
Alice, Arlene, and Anna.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.442
- Okay, so you
remember Alex Chen.

18:59.486 --> 19:02.967
- Yes, and I really helped him.
Perhaps he'll be my new Zeff.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.491
- Welcome back, Captain Holt.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.014
I'm really glad
we could help you with this.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.798
- Oh, no, you're not gonna
just jump back in here

19:07.842 --> 19:09.322
now that it all worked out!

19:09.365 --> 19:10.671
- Thank you, Diaz.
- No!

19:10.714 --> 19:12.847
No, thank Terry.
I did this!

19:12.890 --> 19:14.892
Oh, I'm done.
You know what,

19:14.936 --> 19:16.677
I did all of this.
This was all me!

19:16.720 --> 19:18.157
This is ridiculous!

19:19.897 --> 19:22.204
- We barely got to know her.
- And now we never will.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.685
- I feel so bad for them,
but what do you say to someone

19:24.728 --> 19:26.687
that's suffered
this kind of loss?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.950
- I mean, it's kind of
on them for not checking

19:28.993 --> 19:31.779
the voltage on a machine
that has a built in air-fryer.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.476
- Don't blame the victim, Amy.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.348
- Okay, guys, look.
I know this is sad,

19:35.391 --> 19:37.045
but maybe everything
happens for a reason.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.351
- What reason
could there possibly be

19:38.394 --> 19:39.743
for the pain I'm feeling?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.441
- Look, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this

19:41.484 --> 19:43.138
because I know you'll abuse it,

19:43.182 --> 19:45.009
but when there's
no third machine,

19:45.053 --> 19:49.188
you can come
back here and do this.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.018
- Everything
happens for a reason.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.107
- Peralta!
You have to see this.

19:59.546 --> 20:00.895
Guy got brought
in this morning.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.375
Look what we found on him.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.898
- Yeah, I get it, Rosa.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.378
Every perp in the city
is invited and I'm not.

20:05.421 --> 20:09.686
But I--wait a minute,
why is my name on this?

20:09.730 --> 20:12.254
- 'Cause you're coming
to the wedding, baby!

20:12.298 --> 20:14.038
- What's going on?
You're not mad at me anymore?

20:14.082 --> 20:15.692
I arrested your best man.

20:15.736 --> 20:16.998
- Just like I wanted you to.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.956
I was putting on a show
in front of Trudy.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.219
- What?

20:20.262 --> 20:21.916
- Katherine, my fiancée,
doesn't want any of my

20:21.959 --> 20:23.222
crook friends
coming to the wedding.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.136
She's a federal judge,
how would that look?

20:25.180 --> 20:26.790
- Okay, but couldn't you just
tell them they're not invited?

20:26.834 --> 20:29.010
- Eh...that's an uncomfortable
conversation to have.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.446
It was much easier this way.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.406
- Oh, my God.
This whole thing was a set up?

20:34.798 --> 20:36.104
- You wanted me
to find that invitation.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.366
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.933
- You knew I would
never go on a trip with

20:38.976 --> 20:40.239
a bunch of crooks
unless I felt unwanted.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.631
- Classic negging.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.372
- I bet you planned
to have your bachelor party

20:43.416 --> 20:44.504
at that hotel because you knew

20:44.547 --> 20:45.940
the oligarch was staying there.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.507
- Hell, yeah, otherwise
I would've got an Airbnb.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.117
- And as soon as your
friends committed a crime,

20:49.160 --> 20:50.597
you banked on me
needing to arrest them.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.338
- Damn right.
You're the most consistent

20:52.381 --> 20:53.513
person in my life, Peralta.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.818
I can always count on you.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.168
But, there is one
detail you missed.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.649
You never saw what
I was painting on the inside

20:59.693 --> 21:01.956
of my mug at
the pottery place.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.350
- "Will you be my best man"?

21:04.393 --> 21:05.829
Judy, is this for real?

21:05.873 --> 21:06.961
- It ain't fiction....

21:07.004 --> 21:09.050
♪ Just a natural fact

21:09.093 --> 21:10.530
- What!

21:10.573 --> 21:13.533
both: ♪ We come together
'cause opposites attract ♪

21:13.576 --> 21:15.448
- I'll do it!

21:15.491 --> 21:18.320
both: ♪ Awww...I'm MC Kat
on the rap, so mic it ♪

21:18.364 --> 21:20.496
♪ Here's a little story
and you're sure to like it ♪

21:20.540 --> 21:22.324
- The worst rap!

21:24.370 --> 21:26.328
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
