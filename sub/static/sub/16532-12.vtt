07:48.056 --> 07:50.890
I didn't know that real humans
could have these dimensions.

07:50.915 --> 07:52.835
- Thanks.
- [Laughs] Thank you.

07:57.617 --> 07:58.883
Oops.

07:58.943 --> 08:01.225
I seem to have dropped
my spare hotel key.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.749
- Phil...
- Shh.

08:02.826 --> 08:04.259
No need to call whoever this Phil is.

08:04.328 --> 08:05.560
You're in no danger.

08:05.629 --> 08:09.288
This key is to room 422 at
the Ramada down the street.

08:09.313 --> 08:10.746
Slip out when you can.

08:10.815 --> 08:12.448
I'll pre-disable the smoke detectors

08:12.516 --> 08:14.082
so you don't set it
off when you shimmy out

08:14.185 --> 08:16.153
of those sensible wide-leg trousers.

08:16.193 --> 08:17.459
For the past several Valentine's,

08:17.528 --> 08:19.371
we've adopted sexy alter egos...

08:19.396 --> 08:21.897
Juliana, wild and spontaneous,

08:21.922 --> 08:24.610
and Clive, passionate
collector of beautiful women

08:24.635 --> 08:26.335
and antique sailing maps.

08:26.591 --> 08:29.159
- Clive, I love this id...
- Shh.

08:29.227 --> 08:30.326
Save that energy, my dear.

08:30.395 --> 08:32.028
This hotel has a very short memory

08:32.097 --> 08:34.429
and a very long outdoor staircase.

08:34.466 --> 08:36.496
Claire, you have to finish
signing these contracts.

08:36.522 --> 08:37.631
Hey, Phil.

08:37.657 --> 08:39.357
[Chuckles] Phil? No.

08:39.458 --> 08:40.991
Name's Clive, friend.

08:41.094 --> 08:43.059
Say, maybe you could
take over here for a bit.

08:43.129 --> 08:44.795
[Clears throat] I'll make
sure the boss lady's back

08:44.820 --> 08:46.522
in one piece no later than...

08:46.547 --> 08:47.980
Oh, come on.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.549
- Hi, Phil.
- It's Clive, actually.

08:50.574 --> 08:52.907
Apparently they have a thing
like how you and your sister

08:53.020 --> 08:55.196
go to those conventions
dressed like stuffed animals.

08:55.221 --> 08:58.673
Oh. Uh, Claire, your 2:00 is
here and you can't be late.

08:58.698 --> 09:01.064
Phil, look, I really
appreciate this. I do.

09:01.089 --> 09:02.434
- It's just that...
- So, I spoke to the florist.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.936
Turns out my admirer sent
these from Pritchett's Closets.

09:04.971 --> 09:07.038
I may have a sad love life,
but I don't need my mommy

09:07.107 --> 09:08.593
trying to boost my self-esteem.

09:08.618 --> 09:10.217
And if you really want to
give me some confidence,

09:10.242 --> 09:11.395
how about a picture of me on your desk,

09:11.420 --> 09:12.603
and not just Haley and Luke.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.929
First of all, I didn't
give you those flowers.

09:14.997 --> 09:17.254
Second of all, there
is a picture of you.

09:17.279 --> 09:18.489
- Where is it?
- Mm-hmm.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.573
[knocking]

09:19.598 --> 09:20.996
Salutations.

09:21.021 --> 09:22.347
Yes, hello.

09:22.372 --> 09:23.505
I've got a meeting.

09:23.573 --> 09:25.340
Ben, you're gonna finish
the contract stuff.

09:25.442 --> 09:26.980
Margaret, you're gonna take Alex.

09:27.005 --> 09:30.173
You're gonna find out who's using
our account for flowers, okay?

09:30.242 --> 09:31.839
Phil, honey,

09:31.864 --> 09:33.230
we'll do Valentine's Day later, okay?

09:33.332 --> 09:34.769
Do I know that guy in the cloak?

09:34.794 --> 09:36.949
Ah, hinge specialist. You
might've seen him around.

09:36.974 --> 09:40.997
He's <i> the</i> guy for offbeat
swivels and rare-beveled hook joints.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.411
I find everything you
just said very titila...

09:43.436 --> 09:44.735
- Shh.
- [Gasps]

09:44.803 --> 09:47.303
We'll make up for this
later over dinner, I promise.

09:47.405 --> 09:49.842
I've got it all planned.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.996
This whole Clive thing
wasn't even necessary.

09:52.022 --> 09:54.289
Claire was taking me
out to dinner all along.

09:54.382 --> 09:56.349
Romance strong as ever.

09:56.417 --> 09:57.450
[Intercom beeps]

09:57.519 --> 10:00.152
Claire: <i>Margaret, get a reservation
for me and Phil tonight, anywhere.</i>

10:00.221 --> 10:02.646
<i>I've got too much going
on to even think about it.</i>

10:05.918 --> 10:07.084
[Chocolate thuds]

10:08.444 --> 10:10.278
Sal: Werner is great.

10:10.346 --> 10:13.927
You know, he's a rich musician,
tours a lot, no strings.

10:13.952 --> 10:15.107
Well, um...

10:15.132 --> 10:16.264
[Both yawn]

10:16.303 --> 10:18.410
this has been fun, but we should, uh...

10:18.435 --> 10:20.268
You're not going
anywhere, Carrot Bottom.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.636
Oh, my God. Is that Rainer?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.419
Why is he with another woman?

10:23.444 --> 10:25.210
That sounds cheat-y.

10:25.279 --> 10:27.279
That's Haley's weatherman boyfriend.

10:27.348 --> 10:29.078
- Sorry, Hale.
- We need to leave.

10:29.103 --> 10:30.671
- No, you got to go confront him.
- Mm.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.945
I'm upset. I've had a couple drinks. No.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.202
Okay.

10:34.227 --> 10:35.404
So, what's it like touring the world

10:35.429 --> 10:37.629
- with other Canadian acrobats?
- What?

10:37.741 --> 10:39.775
We just assumed you were a
member of Cirque du Soleil.

10:39.810 --> 10:40.909
Yup, because you're
bending over backwards

10:40.978 --> 10:42.210
to avoid standing up for yourself.

10:42.279 --> 10:43.579
And setting a good example

10:43.681 --> 10:44.907
- for other women.
- For other women.

10:44.932 --> 10:45.965
You both were thinking that?

10:46.067 --> 10:47.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.934
- Fine.
- Finally.

10:49.003 --> 10:50.136
I was beginning to think she was weaker

10:50.204 --> 10:51.563
than Mitchell's jawline.

10:51.588 --> 10:53.455
Everyone knows why you grew that thing.

10:53.523 --> 10:55.713
Okay, this coming from the
woman who... who won't admit

10:55.738 --> 10:57.592
that she's upset that her
boyfriend abandoned her

10:57.617 --> 10:58.683
on Valentine's Day.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.361
Oh, and didn't you just
get back from learning

11:00.397 --> 11:01.940
how to plant corn with the Indians?

11:01.965 --> 11:02.768
Because you look, to us,

11:02.793 --> 11:04.189
- like an early settler.
- Settler.

11:04.721 --> 11:05.754
Both: We're saying that you settle.

11:05.823 --> 11:07.392
You practice this at home, don't you?

11:07.417 --> 11:08.616
Both: We do not.

11:08.684 --> 11:10.451
Now, I knew it couldn't
be angels bowling, so...

11:10.553 --> 11:11.919
I thought you were working today.

11:11.954 --> 11:13.866
And didn't we agree that you
never wear that sweater again?

11:13.891 --> 11:15.090
- My...
- Excuse me.

11:15.158 --> 11:16.190
We're kind of on a date right now.

11:16.293 --> 11:17.342
Uh, Haley.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.984
Oh, save it, you lying,

11:19.062 --> 11:21.029
cheating, middle-aged pointer.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.397
That's what you do,
you know... you point.

11:22.465 --> 11:24.095
You point for your money! We are done!

11:24.120 --> 11:25.786
Happy Valentine's Day.

11:25.888 --> 11:27.221
Oh.

11:27.256 --> 11:28.524
My hair.

11:28.549 --> 11:30.282
- [Gasps]
- Oh, that was crazy

11:30.344 --> 11:31.883
and great and awful and
I don't know what to do.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.180
- I'm just gonna go home.
- What?! No! I like you now.

11:34.205 --> 11:36.674
Werner has a yacht with
a full bar. Let's go.

11:36.699 --> 11:38.207
I'm not letting you
go home in this mood.

11:38.309 --> 11:39.401
- Yes.
- Okay, well, you know,

11:39.426 --> 11:42.102
that sounds kind of
like a girl thing, so...

11:42.127 --> 11:43.133
[Cellphone ringing]

11:43.158 --> 11:44.518
Oh, okay, if that's Rainer calling

11:44.543 --> 11:45.876
to make excuses, don't answer.

11:45.945 --> 11:47.711
It's just pathetic Dylan
trying to hook up again.

11:47.813 --> 11:48.963
Let me handle this.

11:48.988 --> 11:50.280
Hey, Boo Boo.

11:50.305 --> 11:53.606
Well, another woman empowered.

11:53.675 --> 11:55.408
- It's what we do.
- Yes, it is.

11:55.510 --> 11:56.809
- Okay, back to the list.
- [Cellphone rings]

11:56.911 --> 11:58.625
Oh, wait one second. It's Lily.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.665
Hey, honey. Is everything okay?

12:00.885 --> 12:03.619
- Jagger was very hurt by our speech.
- Well...

12:03.644 --> 12:04.890
She didn't answer his texts

12:04.915 --> 12:06.522
- 'cause we told her not to.
- Good.

12:06.591 --> 12:08.124
- He ran away.
- He did?

12:08.193 --> 12:09.592
People are forming a human chain

12:09.694 --> 12:11.027
to search for him in the woods.

12:11.095 --> 12:13.362
Okay, honey, well, we'll
be home soon, all right?

12:13.431 --> 12:14.970
Do you think we have some responsibility

12:14.995 --> 12:16.348
in this Jagger situation?

12:16.373 --> 12:18.049
Ah... no. No.

12:18.074 --> 12:19.974
They... they chose to
build near the woods.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.406
- Good advice is good advice, okay?
- That's right.

12:21.431 --> 12:22.797
You guys, where's Haley?

12:22.866 --> 12:25.867
Um, she is on a boat in the marina,

12:25.935 --> 12:28.202
putting you in her rearview mirror.

12:28.419 --> 12:29.852
- Boats have those, don't they?
- I think so.

12:29.877 --> 12:31.811
You guys, I was only letting that woman

12:31.871 --> 12:33.433
think we were on a date

12:33.466 --> 12:34.932
because she runs a celebrity site

12:35.001 --> 12:36.877
that buys photos from paparazzi, okay?

12:36.902 --> 12:38.168
I was trying to get one of me back

12:38.237 --> 12:40.204
because Haley is in it
and this is the photo.

12:40.272 --> 12:41.882
- No. God, no.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:41.907 --> 12:44.241
Bedhead, sneeze face, and UGG slippers?

12:44.310 --> 12:46.010
And now Haley's not answering my calls

12:46.078 --> 12:48.794
and somehow I'm supposed to
smile through a weather report

12:48.819 --> 12:50.189
in 15 minutes?

12:51.673 --> 12:53.540
Pull yourself together, Rainer.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.490
You're a weatherman.

12:56.908 --> 12:58.026
Do you think our advice...

12:58.128 --> 12:59.528
Sucked? Yes. Yes.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.118
We need to get to that boat
before Haley hooks up with Dylan.

13:02.143 --> 13:03.709
She wouldn't do something that stupid.

13:03.786 --> 13:04.885
Did you see the UGGs?

13:04.953 --> 13:06.337
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:06.362 --> 13:08.429
Mom, I'm home.

13:08.635 --> 13:10.368
We got valentines.

13:10.437 --> 13:12.167
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kewley.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.562
Is the party over?

13:13.640 --> 13:14.706
We had an incident.

13:14.775 --> 13:16.541
Your son gave my Bailey

13:16.610 --> 13:19.175
a very strange Valentine's gift.

13:19.345 --> 13:21.472
I am so sorry.

13:22.464 --> 13:26.066
Didn't your father talk
to you about this already?

13:26.135 --> 13:29.069
Yeah, and he said it's okay
to give it to a girlfriend.

13:29.138 --> 13:31.964
We're going. And Bailey is
certainly not his girlfriend.

13:31.989 --> 13:33.656
She would be lucky!

13:34.910 --> 13:36.043
Is that Bailey?

13:36.112 --> 13:37.978
'Cause I think Joe has
a little thing for her.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.115
Yeah, he did have a
little <i> thing</i> for her.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.975
It's here. He did it again.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.772
I knew I shouldn't have
trusted you talking to him,

13:46.797 --> 13:48.764
because you will let
him get away with murder

13:48.833 --> 13:52.069
because he's a mini you and you like it.

13:52.094 --> 13:53.226
And you know what's worse?

13:53.251 --> 13:54.851
That you're so mean to Manny

13:54.884 --> 13:56.554
because he's different than you.

13:56.562 --> 13:58.729
First off, Joe is not a mini me.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.195
Crap.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.451
Crapola. Crapinski.

14:02.476 --> 14:05.373
Well, maybe a little, and
maybe I kind of like it.

14:05.398 --> 14:07.832
But why would you want to
knock the Jay out of Joe?

14:07.901 --> 14:10.101
Instead of one trophy, you get two.

14:10.203 --> 14:11.336
Ugh.

14:11.404 --> 14:13.638
- Mitchell: Okay, thank God.
- Cameron: Oh, gosh.

14:13.707 --> 14:14.872
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.074
What are you guys doing here?

14:16.168 --> 14:17.567
Need a sailor to cross off number four

14:17.610 --> 14:19.534
on that Valentine's Day list of yours?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.658
Was that mean? I've been
around Sal, I've lost my filter.

14:21.683 --> 14:22.982
You know what? We all make mistakes.

14:23.078 --> 14:24.511
Which is a-a funny thing to remember

14:24.580 --> 14:27.281
when we tell you about a
very funny misunderstanding.

14:27.349 --> 14:30.484
Cameron, Mitchell, what
a pleasant surprise.

14:30.509 --> 14:32.509
Sal, you okay? You seem not yourself.

14:32.611 --> 14:34.343
Yeah, I feel like you used to blink.

14:34.368 --> 14:37.102
I took your advice. Called Werner.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.029
Told him I wasn't going to settle.

14:39.054 --> 14:40.053
- How did that...
- [Shatters]

14:40.122 --> 14:41.454
How... how did that go?

14:41.523 --> 14:44.057
He was thinking that we
might be something special,

14:44.159 --> 14:46.059
and then I gave him the ultimatum,

14:46.128 --> 14:49.005
and he said, "Maybe we're
not actually meant to be."

14:49.030 --> 14:50.444
I don't know what's happening.

14:50.469 --> 14:52.222
S-Sal, w-what are you doing?

14:52.276 --> 14:53.442
Straightening up.

14:53.511 --> 14:55.122
You know, a place for everything...

14:55.147 --> 14:56.747
- No.
- ... everything in its place.

14:56.849 --> 14:58.282
Hey, what about this?

14:58.384 --> 15:01.420
This was actually salvaged
from the <i> Bismarck.</i>

15:01.445 --> 15:02.444
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

15:02.546 --> 15:04.179
- That's...
- Ah! [Laughs]

15:04.248 --> 15:05.414
Why are you helping?

15:05.516 --> 15:06.715
Feels good. Men suck.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.383
No, no, n-not all men, okay?

15:08.444 --> 15:10.690
We... we just talked to Rainer, and, um,

15:10.723 --> 15:11.911
that wasn't a date.

15:11.989 --> 15:13.155
- What?!
- [Shatters]

15:13.257 --> 15:14.156
Okay, why did you break that?

15:14.225 --> 15:15.624
'Cause now I'm mad at you!

15:15.726 --> 15:17.493
You made me break up with him!

15:17.561 --> 15:20.926
Oh, my God. Now I have to
call Rainer... and Dylan.

15:21.309 --> 15:22.990
- Um... Sal,
- Oh, Sal, sweetie...

15:23.023 --> 15:24.472
- you gotta...
- ... you're spilling there.

15:24.497 --> 15:26.273
- lift it, lift it.
- Oh, clumsy, clumsy.

15:26.298 --> 15:28.732
I'll just make it all go away.

15:28.757 --> 15:31.045
- No! We are still on board.
- No, Sal.

15:31.070 --> 15:34.037
[Blows] We are sorry
we made you call Werner.

15:34.139 --> 15:36.673
We didn't [blows] know
that that was gonna happen.

15:36.775 --> 15:38.775
So you have to understand
that you... [blows]

15:38.800 --> 15:40.990
Mitchell [blows] you want to
step in here? I'm getting dizzy.

15:41.015 --> 15:41.989
- I am...
- [Blows]

15:42.014 --> 15:43.169
- Stop it!
- Okay, no more. No more matches.

15:43.194 --> 15:44.158
No more matches.

15:44.183 --> 15:45.315
Okay, what... I don't know what to do.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.516
Okay, well, maybe we should just...

15:46.619 --> 15:48.218
Werner's precious Tony Award.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.787
He keeps in at sea as
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

15:50.890 --> 15:52.192
- For women?
- [Sighs]

15:52.224 --> 15:55.165
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i>
Award for Best Orchestration.

15:55.261 --> 15:57.332
- Oh, my God. No. Sal, Sal. No.
- Haley, help.

15:57.403 --> 15:59.761
I will not tell your gay son

15:59.786 --> 16:02.090
that you threw a Tony into the ocean.

16:02.115 --> 16:03.239
- [Straining] Give it to me!
- No!

16:03.264 --> 16:04.764
- Aah!
- [Water splashes]

16:04.809 --> 16:06.681
Oh, my God. Did she fall in?

16:06.706 --> 16:09.666
No. I've got her right here.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.394
Sal, we are so sorry.

16:15.419 --> 16:16.938
If it wasn't for our stupid advice,

16:16.963 --> 16:19.157
you would've left things alone
and things might've been okay.

16:19.182 --> 16:21.182
- Shut up!
- Okay, okay.

16:21.251 --> 16:24.260
That cold water woke me
up to the hard truth...

16:24.432 --> 16:27.132
I'm smart, I'm beautiful,

16:27.193 --> 16:29.735
- I'm legendary in bed,
- Okay.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.260
yet I do settle.

16:31.305 --> 16:33.603
I mean, Werner is not
good enough for me.

16:33.628 --> 16:35.704
I mean, I get why you
two idiots settled.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.395
This is the best you're
gonna do, right here.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.630
You're perfectly matched.

16:38.732 --> 16:39.864
Both: Aww.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.666
Well, it's kind of sweet
when you look at it that way.

16:41.691 --> 16:42.736
Yeah.

16:42.761 --> 16:44.112
We are very lucky.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.203
Happy Valentine's Day.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.771
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.815
Shut up. Read a room, poofs.

16:50.479 --> 16:52.284
Hey. Margaret said you
keep the phone records.

16:52.309 --> 16:53.642
Why? What do you need them for?

16:53.667 --> 16:55.282
I'm still trying to find out
who sent me those flowers.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.973
- You keep them in here?
- No, don't.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.737
Don't. [Clears throat]

16:59.354 --> 17:01.916
Ben, why do you have this
photo of me in your desk drawer?

17:01.987 --> 17:04.421
I think someone's pranking me, probably.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.490
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

17:06.515 --> 17:09.915
Wait, look. I sent the flowers, okay?

17:10.061 --> 17:11.981
When you temped here last summer,

17:12.006 --> 17:15.141
I became tempted
[chuckles] by your charms.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.290
Well, thank you, but aren't you like 40?

17:18.315 --> 17:19.646
What? I'm 26.

17:19.715 --> 17:22.849
I... I had a SweeTART
addiction when I was a kid

17:22.953 --> 17:25.560
and I permanently damaged my collagen.

17:25.585 --> 17:27.952
Wow. I've been in a series of bizarre,

17:28.054 --> 17:29.854
shame-filled relationships.

17:30.046 --> 17:32.480
You work for my mother.
You still live at home.

17:32.540 --> 17:33.721
Look at all those medications.

17:33.746 --> 17:35.080
- Kiss me.
- What?

17:35.959 --> 17:37.041
Whoa. [Chuckles]

17:37.066 --> 17:38.515
Okay, that was very cool,

17:38.540 --> 17:41.140
but you should know that I have
dedicated my life to closets,

17:41.209 --> 17:42.775
I am obsessed with your grandfather,

17:42.844 --> 17:45.437
and I sleep with a body pillow
that I put a nightgown on.

17:45.462 --> 17:47.161
Stop, you're making it better.

17:50.409 --> 17:52.075
- Here you go.
- Busy night, sir.

17:52.177 --> 17:53.510
I assume you have a reservation?

17:53.612 --> 17:54.889
Yes. My wife made it.

17:54.914 --> 17:56.213
She kind of dropped the ball on my gift,

17:56.282 --> 17:59.517
but she came through with a
table at the legendary Enrico's.

17:59.585 --> 18:01.283
I'm sorry, sir

18:01.308 --> 18:03.744
Enrico's is a couple doors down.

18:07.494 --> 18:08.734
So, just yourself?

18:08.759 --> 18:11.235
Uh, no, I'll be meeting my wife tonight.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.494
[Laughs]

18:12.519 --> 18:14.285
That's the spirit.

18:16.132 --> 18:18.699
[Golf plays on TV, door opens, closes]

18:18.801 --> 18:20.000
What'd I miss?

18:20.102 --> 18:23.423
This overpaid bum missed a putt.

18:23.873 --> 18:25.916
I'm supposed to not like this.

18:26.283 --> 18:28.575
[Sighs] Well, call me an idiot, Jay.

18:28.644 --> 18:31.789
Sure enough, Alexa and I did
end up in a hot tub together.

18:31.814 --> 18:32.979
But around her third beer,

18:33.048 --> 18:35.641
I suggested she have some
water to stay hydrated.

18:35.666 --> 18:37.165
She tried to shut me up by kissing me,

18:37.268 --> 18:40.057
which I liked, but she
kept calling me Travis.

18:40.229 --> 18:42.829
Oh, my God! Is it still talking?!

18:45.070 --> 18:46.199
Joe,

18:46.685 --> 18:48.995
you don't ever disrespect
your brother like that.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.521
And no more giving underwear
to little girls, or anyone else,

18:51.590 --> 18:53.542
'cause it's creepy and European.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.666
Now go to your room.

18:56.027 --> 18:58.288
Jay: It's fun when your
kids get your best qualities,

18:58.313 --> 18:59.946
but it's a kick in the gut

18:59.971 --> 19:02.236
when they pick up stuff
you hate about yourself.

19:02.261 --> 19:04.939
I saw that ugly, impatient part of me

19:04.964 --> 19:07.065
coming out of my adorable son.

19:07.090 --> 19:10.595
In fairness, that adorable
part also came from me.

19:10.915 --> 19:14.181
We both got my mom's crab-apple
cheeks and pillow lips.

19:14.819 --> 19:16.207
Hi, honey.

19:16.232 --> 19:17.825
I'm sorry I'm late.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.650
We had a whole incident... mwah...

19:19.718 --> 19:22.971
at the warehouse, a paint mixer blew up.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.896
Luckily I had these overalls
in my office I could...

19:25.984 --> 19:27.350
Oh, you're mad, aren't you?

19:27.452 --> 19:29.118
Mad? [Chuckles]

19:29.370 --> 19:31.370
I mean, was this the
best Valentine's Day

19:31.472 --> 19:33.005
we've ever had? No.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.997
Was it the worst? Yes.

19:35.143 --> 19:36.375
I gave you a great gift.

19:36.477 --> 19:38.277
I tried to surprise you at the office.

19:38.379 --> 19:40.112
You repaid the effort
by making a reservation

19:40.181 --> 19:43.104
at a truck stop and
dressing up like Tom Sawyer.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.218
But hey, maybe this
happens to everyone, Claire.

19:46.605 --> 19:49.103
Romance fizzles. Magic dies.

19:49.128 --> 19:51.828
At least we can mark the
exact time it happened to us,

19:51.931 --> 19:53.130
thanks to my new watch,

19:53.199 --> 19:55.299
which only a switchboard
operator from the 1950s

19:55.401 --> 19:56.961
could keep wound.

19:57.550 --> 20:00.258
You mean this watch?

20:02.208 --> 20:04.124
The Houdini handcuffs.

20:04.164 --> 20:07.436
I've been taking magic lessons
as a Valentine's surprise.

20:07.461 --> 20:10.353
Wait a minute. The supposed
hinge salesman at your office.

20:10.455 --> 20:12.021
The Great Majesto.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.656
Of course. I didn't recognize him

20:13.758 --> 20:17.033
without his floor-length robe
covered in question marks.

20:17.058 --> 20:20.049
And we also really do have a reservation

20:20.074 --> 20:21.674
at that really nice
place down the street.

20:21.699 --> 20:24.166
So, we should probably get your check.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.878
Excuse me. Can we get the check?

20:26.903 --> 20:30.566
But are you really dressed for...

20:33.177 --> 20:35.069
So wonderful.

20:35.102 --> 20:37.179
- I can't...
- [Laughs]

20:37.281 --> 20:38.481
Mwah.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.648
Come on, honey. We should get going.

20:39.751 --> 20:41.751
Wait, uh, do you have the key?

20:41.853 --> 20:44.357
No. But you do.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.672
I don't deserve you.

20:54.184 --> 20:57.136
Honey, you gave me a V.D.
I will carry with me always.

20:57.232 --> 20:58.865
Let's say "Valentine's Day."

20:58.967 --> 21:02.002
You know, I never thought
you'd beat my gift, but you did.

21:02.104 --> 21:03.170
Oh, honey.

21:03.272 --> 21:04.304
I'm beginning to think that mine

21:04.406 --> 21:05.939
was a swing and a miss.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.741
Hardly. Yours was fantastic.

21:07.843 --> 21:10.644
But how about a swing with a miss?

21:10.669 --> 21:13.703
- You are killing it today!
- I know!

21:13.882 --> 21:15.334
Did you cover that again?

21:15.359 --> 21:17.226
I didn't. That's weird.

21:17.820 --> 21:19.000
[Gasps]

21:19.025 --> 21:20.511
What the hell?

21:20.589 --> 21:23.671
I transported it to the porch.

21:24.526 --> 21:25.859
You're welcome.

21:27.804 --> 21:29.529
I didn't ask him to do that...

21:29.695 --> 21:31.039
or tell him where we live.
