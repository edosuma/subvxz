<i>Hey! What the hell?!</i>

01:16.067 --> 01:18.701
<i>No! What are you ...
Leave me alone!</i>

01:29.414 --> 01:31.344
Whoa.

01:31.464 --> 01:33.637
Looks like uncle Silvio's
third wedding in here.

01:33.757 --> 01:37.408
You're just in time.
Dinner is due any second.

01:37.528 --> 01:39.590
Guess where from.

01:39.626 --> 01:42.108
I'm guessing it's not the pizza
and beer I was hoping for.

01:42.022 --> 01:44.128
<i>Le petit maison.</i>

01:44.163 --> 01:46.362
They have
the best escargot in Boston.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.435
Snails?
Escar-gross.

01:49.555 --> 01:53.459
Think of it as a garlic
and butter delivery system.

01:53.579 --> 01:55.608
Since when did you start liking
fancy French food?

01:55.728 --> 01:57.988
I don't know
if I like it or not.

01:58.108 --> 02:01.908
I just, uh, wanted to thank
Maura for all her generosity

02:01.909 --> 02:04.459
over these last couple of years.

02:04.485 --> 02:05.917
So this is your fault.

02:05.953 --> 02:08.753
If you mean introducing
a refined cuisine

02:08.788 --> 02:11.304
to a curious palate, then yes,
I'm guilty as charged.

02:11.424 --> 02:14.735
I think it's wonderful that
Angela's expanding her horizons.

02:14.855 --> 02:18.842
Yeah. I'm free, I'm single,
I got a new job,

02:18.843 --> 02:21.308
and it's time I started
to live it up a little.

02:21.428 --> 02:23.603
Don't worry, Jane.

02:23.604 --> 02:25.972
I'm making more money now
than I ever did.

02:26.007 --> 02:28.107
And I got three new credit cards
this week.

02:31.813 --> 02:33.894
Yes, but, Mom, you do realize
that you have to

02:34.014 --> 02:36.422
pay those off with real money, right?

02:36.542 --> 02:37.644
<i>Here you go.</i>

02:38.676 --> 02:41.830
Hmm. What is it?
It's... Blackberry,

02:41.950 --> 02:44.971
with a hint of...
coffee bean.

02:45.622 --> 02:47.591
That was not the backup
I was looking for.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.927
I have a weakness
for a good Bordeaux.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.810
- Rizzoli.
- Dr. Isles.

02:55.930 --> 02:58.738
- Aw, come on!
- We'll be right there.

02:58.858 --> 03:01.914
We ... I-I'm sorry.
Ma, we can take it to go.

03:01.915 --> 03:02.699
No, no, no, no, no.

03:02.819 --> 03:04.983
Escargot does not travel,
but it does reheat.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.551
Thank you, Angela.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.553
Thanks, Ma.

03:13.794 --> 03:18.062
Angela, party for one,
your table is ready.

03:43.759 --> 03:46.659
Ma's been spending like crazy,
ever since she got that job.

03:46.695 --> 03:48.628
If she doesn't knock it off,
she's gonna end up bankrupt

03:48.663 --> 03:51.264
or living on the street.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.166
Or even worse, with me.

03:53.201 --> 03:55.101
All Angela needs
is a good financial system

03:55.137 --> 03:58.805
- to manage her new income.
- Well, can you talk to her about that?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.828
The only financial system I use
is to carry cash...

04:00.948 --> 04:02.008
and a gun.

04:02.128 --> 04:04.115
I can give her some pointers
if you think it will help.

04:04.235 --> 04:06.934
Yes, please.
Hey, what do we got?

04:06.935 --> 04:08.626
Uh, the victim is Dylan Blyer.

04:08.631 --> 04:10.564
He and his wife own
Mamaki Clothing.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.868
They design and sell
socially conscious clothes,

04:13.903 --> 04:16.935
- whatever that means.
- It's an emphasis on global responsibility.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.706
You know, paying a living wage
to workers

04:18.741 --> 04:20.685
and utilizing
sustainable materials.

04:20.805 --> 04:22.276
Could be that they are
importing their cotton

04:22.311 --> 04:24.602
from villages in Africa,
which helps the locals

04:24.722 --> 04:27.327
support themselves,
stopping the cycle of poverty.

04:27.447 --> 04:30.381
Well, his employees couldn't say
enough good things about him.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.514
Got along with everyone,
no conflicts, no personal issues.

04:33.634 --> 04:35.314
Plus, he was
a real visionary.

04:35.434 --> 04:37.602
Committed to the business
and to helping people.

04:37.722 --> 04:40.425
Well, how did such a nice guy
end up like this?

04:40.460 --> 04:43.221
Well, the sales guy said that
he heard an argument upstairs,

04:43.341 --> 04:45.649
and then
Dylan fell off the ledge.

04:45.769 --> 04:49.970
There's blood-stained foam
from the nose and the lips.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.992
The skin has a bluish-gray tint.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.094
That wasn't caused by the fall.

04:59.134 --> 05:01.201
Looks like somebody
searched through the desk.

05:01.236 --> 05:02.535
Well, the store was locked

05:02.571 --> 05:04.204
and there was no sign
of forced entry.

05:04.239 --> 05:06.773
But a neighbor did notice
a panel van speeding away

05:06.808 --> 05:08.108
around the time of death.

05:08.143 --> 05:10.722
- They get a plate?
- Only a partial.

05:10.729 --> 05:11.862
I put out a B.O.L.O.

05:11.897 --> 05:13.497
Have C.S.R.U. check
the computer,

05:13.532 --> 05:16.299
see if any files
were downloaded.

05:16.335 --> 05:18.168
All right, so what do we think
we're looking at here?

05:18.203 --> 05:20.137
The ... the owner comes back
unexpectedly,

05:20.172 --> 05:21.943
finds somebody
searching his office?

05:22.063 --> 05:23.180
Burglary gone bad?

05:23.300 --> 05:24.708
Yeah, but the burglar wasn't
looking for cash.

05:24.743 --> 05:27.081
He took some files,
possibly searched the computer.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.040
Corporate espionage.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.196
Let's find out everything we can
about the company ...

05:31.316 --> 05:33.131
who works here,
how much money they make.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.191
See if anybody has
any secrets worth stealing.

05:40.771 --> 05:42.570
I haven't been able
to contact Zoe Blyer.

05:42.606 --> 05:43.938
The victim's wife?

05:43.974 --> 05:45.774
Yeah. I left messages on her
cell numbers and home numbers.

05:45.809 --> 05:49.094
Had uniforms stop by
their apartment. Nothing.

05:49.214 --> 05:51.179
So one owner of
the company is dead,

05:51.214 --> 05:53.566
and the other owner is missing.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.717
I'll have Frankie go to the office,

05:55.752 --> 05:58.402
ask around, see if anybody knows
where we might find her.

05:58.522 --> 06:00.806
I'm not supposed to say anything, but...

06:00.926 --> 06:04.057
I heard he failed his
firearms qualifications test.

06:04.177 --> 06:06.001
My Frankie?
That's impossible.

06:06.002 --> 06:07.165
Evidently not.

06:07.285 --> 06:09.355
No, he's ... he's a great shot.
I taught him myself.

06:09.390 --> 06:10.689
Maybe he needs a refresher.

06:10.725 --> 06:13.548
He's only got two more chances
to pass or he'll get suspended.

06:15.483 --> 06:20.720
Additional subendocardial
hemorrhages in the left ventricle.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.488
I thought you'd want to know
right away.

06:22.524 --> 06:25.475
- The fall didn't kill Dylan Blyer.
- Okay.

06:25.595 --> 06:27.260
Actual cause of death
was poisoning.

06:27.295 --> 06:29.518
No needle marks,
so it's likely he ingested it.

06:29.638 --> 06:30.925
Any idea what it was?

06:31.045 --> 06:32.632
It's from
the phenethylamine family.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.699
But I've never seen
this exact combination.

06:34.819 --> 06:37.696
- We'll know soon, though.
- Yes, we will!

06:38.314 --> 06:41.549
Is the phen-ethel merman fairy
gonna tell you?

06:41.669 --> 06:44.381
I'm afraid not,
but it is the perfect test run

06:44.416 --> 06:47.036
for our Bio-orbitron MS-8000
mass spectrometer.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.396
It's being delivered today.

06:48.516 --> 06:51.416
It is the most advanced
chemical analyzer in the world.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.611
Ultrahigh resolution.

06:52.731 --> 06:55.604
- Recombinant glycoprotein characterizations.
- Oh, my gosh.

06:55.609 --> 06:57.141
Remember when you girls got
that new D.N.A. splicer

06:57.177 --> 06:59.310
and you talked
about it for weeks?

06:59.346 --> 07:01.602
This is even more boring than that!

07:01.722 --> 07:04.282
Hey, Jane. We just got a hit off
the B.O.L.O. for that van.

07:04.317 --> 07:05.950
Okay.

07:05.986 --> 07:08.318
Have fun with your new toy.

07:14.795 --> 07:17.651
Looks like the right van.
But a plumbing company?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.998
I don't know about that.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.336
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.487
Yeah, it's coming from inside.

07:26.607 --> 07:29.059
Zoe Blyer's still missing.

07:32.343 --> 07:34.095
Hey!
Get the hell outta there!

07:34.215 --> 07:35.714
Put your hands in the air.
Boston P.D.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.549
Don't shoot.

07:40.589 --> 07:43.423
- What's in the bags?
- Garbage.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.146
You can't arrest me
for picking up garbage.

07:45.266 --> 07:47.560
If it's outside, I can take it.
It's totally legal.

07:47.596 --> 07:48.895
Yeah, I'm sure there's something
in those bags

07:48.930 --> 07:50.330
we can arrest you for.

07:50.365 --> 07:53.600
This van was seen fleeing
a crime scene last night.

07:53.635 --> 07:55.486
- Yeah.
- I.D.?

07:55.606 --> 07:58.071
Yeah, I'm going for my I.D.
Don't shoot.

07:58.106 --> 08:00.173
What were you doing there?

08:03.612 --> 08:06.279
Making our lives harder.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.913
Oh, good. He's a P.I.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.408
We found the contents of
Dylan Blyer's desk in your van.

08:23.444 --> 08:26.311
Right.
It's part of my investigation.

08:26.347 --> 08:28.044
Well, ours, too,

08:28.164 --> 08:30.749
since it seems like
you were there when he died.

08:30.869 --> 08:33.318
Fine. I was there, but I had
nothing to do with it.

08:33.354 --> 08:35.690
He came in acting all crazy,

08:35.809 --> 08:38.261
like he was tripping on something.
Then he started screaming at me.

08:38.381 --> 08:39.825
He stumbled backwards,
went over the rail.

08:39.860 --> 08:42.128
And ... and I tried to grab him,
but he just went over.

08:42.248 --> 08:44.429
Mm-hmm. No, no, that's ...
that's a nice story.

08:44.549 --> 08:46.131
What about this?

08:46.166 --> 08:47.599
Blyer surprised you in his office.

08:47.635 --> 08:48.934
He threatened to call the cops,

08:48.969 --> 08:51.236
and you pushed him over rail
to shut him up.

08:51.271 --> 08:54.573
I like my story better
'cause it's what happened.

08:54.608 --> 08:58.426
Look, I swear.
I didn't touch the guy.

09:00.682 --> 09:03.316
You've been following him
for the past two weeks.

09:03.351 --> 09:05.151
Who hired you?

09:05.186 --> 09:08.654
I don't give up my clients.
Confidentiality issues.

09:08.690 --> 09:10.456
You know that privilege
doesn't extend to P.I.s,

09:10.491 --> 09:12.262
so if you'd like to add
obstruction to your ...

09:12.382 --> 09:14.777
- Blyer's wife.
- Why'd she hire you?

09:14.897 --> 09:17.038
She thought he
was having an affair.

09:17.158 --> 09:19.000
- Was he?
- It seemed like it.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.499
I mean, he was acting
all kinds of shady ...

09:20.535 --> 09:23.476
sneaking around, lying about
where he was going.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.239
Did you ever see him
with another woman?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.273
I wish.

09:27.309 --> 09:30.243
Do you know the bonus I get
for a money shot like that?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.326
Divorce attorneys love me.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.948
And the more naked,
the better.

09:37.053 --> 09:38.719
No.

09:38.755 --> 09:41.489
I didn't. That's why I was
in his office.

09:41.524 --> 09:43.824
I was having
no luck trailing him.

09:43.860 --> 09:46.527
I mean, he eats at the same
vegan restaurant for lunch,

09:46.562 --> 09:49.296
and he goes to the same
yoga place every afternoon.

09:49.332 --> 09:50.462
And I had to find something.

09:50.582 --> 09:53.567
You know, e-mail, a love letter.

09:53.603 --> 09:56.252
Which is why I visited his office.

09:56.372 --> 09:58.695
Which is why you
broke into his office.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.590
Well, the client
gave me the key, so...

10:01.710 --> 10:03.909
technically, it's a gray area.

10:04.029 --> 10:06.195
When's the last time
you spoke to Zoe?

10:06.315 --> 10:07.700
Last night.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.738
I called her to tell her
Dylan was dead.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.243
She seem surprised?

10:11.363 --> 10:15.843
Now that you mention it,
not so much.

10:19.097 --> 10:21.030
C.S.R.U. finished processing
the van.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.832
They brought everything
that P.I. gathered

10:22.867 --> 10:24.200
into the conference room.

10:24.235 --> 10:25.968
Well, not the garbage, just
everything that was relevant.

10:26.004 --> 10:29.339
All right, well, Jerry
Jankowski's client was Zoe Blyer.

10:29.374 --> 10:31.140
She thought Dylan was
having an affair.

10:31.176 --> 10:32.542
Well, he might not have been
as squeaky-lean

10:32.577 --> 10:34.911
- as his employees thought.
- Yeah, neither was she.

10:34.946 --> 10:37.146
She had two drug convictions
when she was younger.

10:37.182 --> 10:39.041
Well, maybe it's not about
the business after all.

10:39.161 --> 10:41.270
Jealousy's a powerful motive.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.365
And she hasn't been seen
or heard from since he died.

10:43.485 --> 10:44.904
Nothing on her A.T.M.
or credit cards?

10:45.024 --> 10:46.675
No, and she hasn't used
her cell phone.

10:46.795 --> 10:48.789
All right,
I'll put out an A.P.B.,

10:48.909 --> 10:50.599
and I'll have Frankie go through
the P.I.'s stuff

10:50.719 --> 10:52.427
to see if we can place
Zoe and Dylan together

10:52.547 --> 10:54.294
- on the day of the murder.
- Yeah, I'll do it.

10:54.414 --> 10:55.520
Frankie's down at
the firing range practicing,

10:55.640 --> 10:58.334
and from what I hear, he needs it.

11:06.022 --> 11:09.469
- Did Jane put you up to this?
- She only wants to help.

11:09.589 --> 11:12.650
I can handle my own money...
Just fine.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.374
Of course. Of course. But with
income from the new job,

11:15.494 --> 11:18.791
it might help to just establish
some rules for yourself.

11:18.911 --> 11:22.582
- Rules?
- Like... practicing restraint.

11:22.702 --> 11:25.134
Not splurging on expensive items.

11:25.254 --> 11:28.033
And I have a few strategies
of my own I can share with you.

11:28.069 --> 11:30.235
Do any of these "strategies"

11:30.271 --> 11:34.540
Have to do with what's in
your "study closet"?

11:34.938 --> 11:38.944
Study closet?
I'm not sure I understand.

11:38.980 --> 11:42.086
Oh, you understand
perfectly well.

11:42.206 --> 11:45.117
Maybe there's a chapter in here
that deals with splurging.

11:45.152 --> 11:48.190
Or not splurging,
as the case may be.

11:49.691 --> 11:52.125
I know talking about
money is difficult,

11:52.160 --> 11:54.360
but it is also important.

11:54.396 --> 11:59.208
- I have customers.
- So do I. Well, bodies.

11:59.968 --> 12:01.868
I'll see you at home.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.608
And we can
talk about this then.

12:03.728 --> 12:05.905
Or not.
We can see how we feel.

12:12.381 --> 12:13.714
Hey, that was better.

12:13.750 --> 12:14.882
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.117
How's my grip?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.252
Look, try to just use
the two middle fingers.

12:18.287 --> 12:19.520
Okay? Like that.

12:19.555 --> 12:21.922
All right, now slowly...

12:21.958 --> 12:23.124
squeeze.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.659
Good.

12:25.695 --> 12:27.328
Keep practicing.
Will do!

12:29.166 --> 12:30.966
You failed your
shooting test on purpose?!

12:31.001 --> 12:33.068
What? No way.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.303
Well, either that
or you're going blind,

12:35.339 --> 12:37.169
which, from the way
you were staring at her ass,

12:37.289 --> 12:38.707
I can see is not the case!

12:39.910 --> 12:41.142
It's no big deal. Okay?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.878
I just needed a reason
to have a couple of lessons

12:42.913 --> 12:45.593
with the new firearms instructor.
Alexandra.

12:46.149 --> 12:47.449
I mean, did you see her?

12:47.484 --> 12:49.885
This is sad on so many levels!

12:49.920 --> 12:50.850
What?

12:50.970 --> 12:53.662
I'm gonna ace the next test.
Don't worry.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.428
Hey, I am just saying
you're new to Boston,

12:59.463 --> 13:00.662
and I could show you places

13:00.698 --> 13:02.383
that you will not find
in the guidebook.

13:02.503 --> 13:06.101
- Stop talking.
- Oh, have you ever had razor clams?

13:06.137 --> 13:08.364
You charge people
for this nonsense?

13:08.484 --> 13:11.001
"10:00 P.M. ...
Dirty abused hobbits"?

13:11.009 --> 13:12.208
It's a code.

13:12.243 --> 13:14.644
"Dirty Abused Hobbits."
D.A.H.

13:14.679 --> 13:17.133
- "Dylan Arrives Home."
- You messing with me?

13:17.253 --> 13:20.037
No. See, that way, they can't
force me to testify.

13:20.157 --> 13:22.872
- Pretty smart, right?
- You told detective Rizzoli

13:22.992 --> 13:24.682
you called Zoe Blyer
right after the murder.

13:24.802 --> 13:26.777
I checked her cell records.
No call from you.

13:26.897 --> 13:28.596
I don't call my
clients' cell phones.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.570
I give 'em burner cells
because they can't be traced.

13:31.597 --> 13:33.906
- Of course they can.
- They can?

13:34.722 --> 13:37.524
- What's the number?
- Um, okay.

13:37.644 --> 13:41.004
Uh, first time I met her,
golden Szechuan Palace.

13:46.269 --> 13:47.912
I got it.

13:47.948 --> 13:50.615
You and me,
our minds are like one.

13:50.650 --> 13:52.016
Not even a little bit.

13:52.052 --> 13:54.752
I'll run the number,
let you know when we find her.

13:56.523 --> 13:58.423
Wow.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.925
Am I right?

14:00.961 --> 14:02.493
Wow.

14:02.529 --> 14:04.493
Wow.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.434
I'm at the address now.

14:08.469 --> 14:10.069
<i>The cell pinged
from that location</i>

14:10.104 --> 14:12.438
<i>less than a half-hour ago.
Backup's on the way now.</i>

14:16.344 --> 14:18.711
Tell them she's on the move.

14:23.217 --> 14:24.617
Zoe Blyer?

14:26.153 --> 14:29.021
Hey. Boston police!
I just wanna talk to you!

14:29.056 --> 14:30.147
No!

14:30.267 --> 14:32.825
No! Stay ...

14:32.860 --> 14:34.860
<i>- Stay away!
- Drop your weapon!</i>

14:34.896 --> 14:37.663
Hold on! Hold your fire!

14:37.833 --> 14:41.973
Zoe, now we just wanna
talk to you about Dylan.

14:42.093 --> 14:44.237
- He's dead.
- I know.

14:45.908 --> 14:48.575
Put the gun down.
We don't wanna hurt you.

14:48.610 --> 14:50.855
No, no, they killed him.

14:50.975 --> 14:54.362
Zoe, I wanna help you,

14:55.465 --> 14:57.884
but you have to drop the gun.

15:05.294 --> 15:07.628
Please.

15:07.663 --> 15:09.230
Help me...

15:09.265 --> 15:11.365
or they're gonna kill me, too.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.050
All right.

15:13.170 --> 15:14.241
Okay.

15:14.749 --> 15:15.807
Easy.

15:15.927 --> 15:18.102
Easy. Easy.

15:25.229 --> 15:27.897
Who are you running from?

15:27.932 --> 15:30.866
I don't know. Dylan warned me
we were in danger.

15:30.902 --> 15:32.701
- From who?
- He wouldn't say.

15:32.737 --> 15:34.937
Come on, Zoe.
We know that you hired a P.I.

15:34.972 --> 15:37.773
because you thought
that Dylan was having an affair.

15:37.809 --> 15:39.675
Must've made you angry.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.597
Sometimes we do crazy things
when we're angry.

15:41.717 --> 15:44.358
- I was hurt, not angry.
- Were you using again?

15:44.478 --> 15:45.880
What? No.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.542
I've been clean for seven years,
thanks to Dylan.

15:49.662 --> 15:52.236
I wouldn't have made it without him.

15:52.356 --> 15:53.955
You think I killed him?

15:54.075 --> 15:56.822
- You tell us.
- I would never hurt Dylan.

15:56.942 --> 15:59.580
I was just confused.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.908
He always talked to me
about everything.

16:01.943 --> 16:03.776
Then one day, he started
shutting me out.

16:03.812 --> 16:05.979
When was the last time
you spoke with him?

16:06.014 --> 16:07.811
The day he died.

16:07.931 --> 16:10.678
He told me he was
out of town on business.

16:10.798 --> 16:13.857
The investigator e-mailed me
pictures of him

16:13.893 --> 16:16.892
at some cheap motel
here in Boston.

16:17.012 --> 16:19.826
I called him and I accused him
of horrible things.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.699
Who did you think he was
having an affair with?

16:22.735 --> 16:25.068
Our account Renee.

16:25.104 --> 16:26.462
He'd been meeting with her a lot.

16:26.465 --> 16:29.467
And he denied it?
He swore he wasn't cheating.

16:29.587 --> 16:33.107
He told me he got mixed up
with some dangerous people,

16:33.227 --> 16:35.070
and the less I knew, the better.

16:35.190 --> 16:37.171
But he had
some kind of evidence

16:37.207 --> 16:39.092
that would make everything right again.

16:39.212 --> 16:42.701
- Did he say what that was?
- No.

16:44.372 --> 16:47.539
Jerry called and told me
Dylan was dead.

16:48.876 --> 16:51.377
And I realized...

16:51.412 --> 16:54.513
He'd been telling me the truth,
and we really were in danger.

16:54.548 --> 16:56.248
So you went into hiding.

16:56.284 --> 16:59.118
I should've trusted him.

16:59.621 --> 17:02.822
I should've believed in him
like he always believed in me.

17:16.672 --> 17:19.106
You look like someone just
drowned your puppy.

17:19.141 --> 17:21.708
I just...
I failed my shooting test.

17:21.743 --> 17:24.243
- Again.
- You know what?

17:24.280 --> 17:26.313
You keep screwing around,
you're gonna regret it.

17:26.348 --> 17:28.147
That's the thing.
I really tried this time.

17:28.183 --> 17:29.278
It's Alexandra.

17:29.398 --> 17:30.951
She was standing so close to me,
I couldn't focus.

17:30.986 --> 17:32.286
All I could think about was
coming up with the perfect line

17:32.321 --> 17:34.521
- to ask her out.
- How about,

17:34.557 --> 17:37.124
"the only thing I love more
than a woman in uniform"

17:37.159 --> 17:39.384
"is a woman out of uniform"?
That's always a winner.

17:39.504 --> 17:41.978
I'm serious. Tomorrow could be
my last chance.

17:42.098 --> 17:44.348
You have to come and ...
and keep her away from me.

17:44.468 --> 17:46.443
- What?! No!
- Yes.

17:46.563 --> 17:47.458
Fine.

17:47.578 --> 17:51.055
This is what you get
for thinking with your... gun.

17:55.296 --> 17:57.129
I understand you were
the only account for Mamaki

17:57.165 --> 17:58.564
since it started?

17:58.599 --> 18:02.334
That's right. I handle most of
their financial affairs.

18:02.370 --> 18:05.504
Dylan and Zoe are more
visionaries than business people.

18:05.540 --> 18:06.672
Were there any issues?

18:06.707 --> 18:08.007
Cash flow problems?
Anything like that?

18:08.042 --> 18:09.542
Not for a long time.

18:09.577 --> 18:11.277
The first couple years
were difficult,

18:11.312 --> 18:14.413
but it's been going well for a while.

18:14.449 --> 18:17.950
- What turned things around?
- Dylan's passion.

18:17.985 --> 18:19.985
He believed in
his company's mission,

18:20.021 --> 18:22.487
and he made his investors
believe in it, too.

18:22.607 --> 18:25.591
Dylan visited your office
several times last week.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.024
How did you know that?

18:28.144 --> 18:30.580
We have a source.
About all I can say now.

18:30.933 --> 18:34.258
A source.
I see.

18:34.378 --> 18:37.098
Well, I came down here
because I wanted to help,

18:37.218 --> 18:40.953
but now I'm wondering if I
should have an attorney present.

18:42.785 --> 18:45.686
Our source is
a private investigator.

18:45.721 --> 18:47.254
Zoe Blyer hired him
to follow Dylan

18:47.289 --> 18:49.790
because she thought he might
be having an affair.

18:49.825 --> 18:50.991
With you, actually.

18:51.026 --> 18:52.408
No. No.

18:52.528 --> 18:54.522
Dylan would never
cheat on Zoe.

18:54.642 --> 18:56.296
He loved her.

18:56.332 --> 18:58.441
And he's the most honest person I know.

18:58.561 --> 19:01.668
If there weren't any problems,
why so many visits?

19:01.704 --> 19:05.572
He was considering
an expansion into New York,

19:05.607 --> 19:08.775
and I thought he might
be moving too fast.

19:08.895 --> 19:11.324
I still can't believe he's gone.

19:11.325 --> 19:13.675
Well, we are doing
everything we can

19:13.680 --> 19:15.280
to figure out what happened.

19:15.315 --> 19:16.448
If you could provide
the company's books,

19:16.483 --> 19:17.849
that might be helpful.

19:17.885 --> 19:19.204
Of course.

19:19.887 --> 19:21.626
Dylan was amazing.

19:21.746 --> 19:24.022
He didn't deserve this.

19:29.024 --> 19:31.667
Hello,
tall, shiny, and handsome.

19:31.787 --> 19:33.802
And he doesn't leave
the toilet seat up.

19:33.922 --> 19:38.135
Jane Rizzoli, I would like you
to meet Bio-Orbitron MS-8000.

19:38.255 --> 19:40.998
This things costs more than
I make in a year, doesn't it?

19:41.118 --> 19:43.034
It costs more than
everyone makes in a year.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.378
Speaking of, how'd the
conversation go with my mom?

19:45.413 --> 19:47.782
Not as well as I'd hoped.

19:47.902 --> 19:50.950
Angela's by resistant
to advice on financial matters.

19:50.985 --> 19:53.049
She's resistant to everything.
I'll talk to her.

19:53.169 --> 19:53.930
No.

19:54.050 --> 19:57.034
I mean, um, you know,
who knows what she'll say?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.072
She hasn't said anything to you,
has she?

19:59.192 --> 20:00.645
About what?

20:00.765 --> 20:03.517
Well, about...I don't know.
Um, investments or...

20:03.637 --> 20:05.741
- Closets.
- Closets?

20:06.478 --> 20:08.185
- Never mind.
- Okay.

20:08.305 --> 20:12.203
So I did a comprehensive
analysis on the poison.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.316
The reason wasn't able
to identify it

20:14.436 --> 20:17.927
is because it's from an entirely
new synthetic hallucinogenic.

20:18.047 --> 20:19.777
A drug? What, like L.S.D.?

20:19.897 --> 20:21.618
It's more like similar
to the newer designer drugs,

20:21.738 --> 20:24.392
like M.D.M.A. and 2C-I,
that are on the rave scene now.

20:24.512 --> 20:26.742
- So our victim O.D.ed?
- Technically, yes.

20:26.746 --> 20:28.563
He had a massive amount
in his system ...

20:28.683 --> 20:31.152
six times the normal dosage level.

20:31.157 --> 20:33.324
Well, that can't be accidental.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.627
Well, how hard is it for
somebody to give him that much?

20:35.662 --> 20:38.569
Well, it's odorless, tasteless,
undetectable in food and drink.

20:38.689 --> 20:42.100
I will be able to pinpoint
the time he ingested it shortly.

20:42.135 --> 20:43.934
I also remembered something.

20:44.054 --> 20:46.598
There was a similar death
in amherst a few months ago.

20:46.718 --> 20:49.769
A student O.D.ed on an
unidentified hallucinogenic drug.

20:49.889 --> 20:52.614
So I ran the chemical analysis
through the database

20:52.734 --> 20:54.045
and found three other cases ...

20:54.165 --> 20:56.313
one in Providence
and two in Georgetown.

20:56.433 --> 20:58.625
Wait a second. Can you pull up
those crime scene photos?

20:58.745 --> 21:00.218
Of course.

21:01.730 --> 21:04.297
There. That one.

21:05.934 --> 21:07.734
Zoom in on that.

21:09.504 --> 21:12.272
Amherst, Providence,
and Georgetown.

21:12.307 --> 21:13.540
Mamaki sells their clothes

21:13.575 --> 21:15.842
in every city
where you found that drug.

21:16.979 --> 21:18.912
You think the company
is being used as a cover

21:18.947 --> 21:20.338
for a distribution ring?

21:20.458 --> 21:22.449
If it is, then the people
Dylan was involved with

21:22.484 --> 21:24.312
are drug dealers,
and whatever evidence

21:24.432 --> 21:26.419
he collected
may be what got him killed.

21:32.310 --> 21:33.442
I talked to narcotics.

21:33.478 --> 21:35.244
There's a new designer
drug called viper

21:35.280 --> 21:37.146
that's hit the college scene.

21:37.181 --> 21:39.048
<i>That may be the same drug
that killed Dylan Blyer.</i>

21:39.083 --> 21:41.517
- Have any idea who's behind it?
- No, but landry's gonna

21:41.552 --> 21:42.966
check with his C.I.S
and see what they know.

21:43.086 --> 21:43.986
What'd you find at the motel?

21:44.022 --> 21:46.255
Blyer requested the same room
every time he stayed here.

21:46.291 --> 21:48.491
<i>- Was he meeting drug connections there?
- Manager said that</i>

21:48.526 --> 21:49.725
he stayed alone
and never had any visitors.

21:49.761 --> 21:51.554
<i>You know what?
It ... it doesn't feel right,</i>

21:51.674 --> 21:52.995
Him dealing in drugs.
He hated drugs.

21:53.031 --> 21:54.931
He kept his wife clean
for years.

21:54.966 --> 21:56.156
Look at this.

21:56.276 --> 21:58.160
This is the worst room in the place,

21:58.280 --> 22:00.296
but it's got the best view of that.

22:00.416 --> 22:03.796
<i>- Hey, Jane, are you with Nina?
- Uh, yeah. Hang on a second.</i>

22:03.916 --> 22:05.184
Go ahead.

22:05.304 --> 22:07.407
Hey, do you have any information
On a Mamaki distribution warehouse?

22:07.527 --> 22:09.398
We have a name ...
Ward Logistics.

22:09.518 --> 22:11.402
No address, though.
Just a P.O. Box.

22:11.522 --> 22:12.657
Why? Did you find something?

22:12.777 --> 22:15.922
I don't know.
Let me get back to you.

22:16.806 --> 22:19.606
Ugh. If I had to look at
that many numbers every day,

22:19.642 --> 22:20.774
I would just lay down and cry.

22:20.810 --> 22:22.409
Do you see anything interesting?

22:22.445 --> 22:23.677
Their accountant was right.

22:23.713 --> 22:25.632
Mamaki had
some committed investors.

22:25.752 --> 22:27.393
Several substantial
cash contributions

22:27.513 --> 22:29.661
over the last few years,
which is strange.

22:29.781 --> 22:30.696
Strange is good.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.294
Strange is our friend
in a murder investigation.

22:32.414 --> 22:34.239
The company wasn't
profitable yet,

22:34.359 --> 22:35.793
but they kept expanding
anyway.

22:35.913 --> 22:37.774
Which made me wonder
if maybe those investors

22:37.894 --> 22:40.284
were interested
in something else, like drugs.

22:40.404 --> 22:42.464
So I pulled the filing papers

22:42.584 --> 22:44.930
on the investors, and found out
they all lead back

22:45.050 --> 22:46.165
to one anonymous shell corp.

22:46.236 --> 22:48.864
"Anonymous" is not our friend.
We need a name.

22:48.984 --> 22:49.943
On it.

22:59.284 --> 23:00.417
Can I help you?

23:00.452 --> 23:02.786
Boston P.D. We need to speak
to the owner.

23:11.396 --> 23:14.264
I'm Stanton Ward.
Can I help you, detectives?

23:14.299 --> 23:15.465
Stanton Ward of Ward Logistics?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.334
- Yes.
- Did you work with Dylan Blyer?

23:18.370 --> 23:21.671
Oh, that's right. You must be
looking into Dylan's death.

23:21.706 --> 23:24.974
It's very upsetting.
Not just personally.

23:25.010 --> 23:26.543
I mean, he was
an exceptional young man,

23:26.578 --> 23:29.279
but professionally, too.
Mamaki is my biggest client.

23:29.314 --> 23:31.247
What did you do
for them exactly?

23:31.283 --> 23:33.511
We're basically a clearinghouse
for everything that comes into

23:33.515 --> 23:35.880
or goes out of Mamaki.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.579
They import their cotton
from Africa.

23:37.699 --> 23:39.851
When it arrives here, we deliver
it to the manufacturer

23:39.858 --> 23:40.906
who make the clothes.

23:41.026 --> 23:42.998
The finished items come back
here to be sorted and packaged,

23:43.118 --> 23:44.371
and then distributed
down to the stores.

23:44.374 --> 23:46.374
Mr. Ward, when's the last time
you saw Dylan?

23:46.409 --> 23:47.575
A week or so ago.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.577
He usually stops by
a couple times a month.

23:49.612 --> 23:52.113
So he wasn't in any time
over the last few days?

23:52.148 --> 23:53.801
Uh, it's been at least a week.

23:53.921 --> 23:55.416
Did he seem concerned about anything?

23:55.451 --> 23:58.403
Why? You got some reason
to think that he wasn't happy?

23:58.523 --> 24:00.627
- Do you?
- No.

24:01.241 --> 24:03.708
Mind if we take a look around?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.798
I run a top-notch operation.

24:05.918 --> 24:08.164
We've passed every government
inspection with flying colors,

24:08.284 --> 24:10.068
and we've never been cited
with a violation.

24:10.188 --> 24:11.543
You can look anywhere you like,
detectives.

24:11.663 --> 24:13.899
- We got nothing to hide.
- Thank you.

24:16.297 --> 24:18.898
You think Blyer was spying on
his own distributor?

24:18.933 --> 24:21.434
If he's as honest
as everybody says he was,

24:21.469 --> 24:23.235
it's possible he didn't know
about the drugs.

24:23.271 --> 24:26.508
Then somehow he finds out
or he gets suspicious...

24:26.628 --> 24:29.742
- So he starts his own investigation...
- Which leads him here.

24:29.777 --> 24:33.485
He told Zoe he had evidence
that would make everything right.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.681
We need to find what he found.

24:35.717 --> 24:38.851
Let's get a warrant, bring
some drug dogs down here.

24:38.886 --> 24:40.252
I love dogs.

24:44.126 --> 24:45.259
Rizzoli.

24:45.294 --> 24:47.294
<i>Jane, I finished
testing the drug.</i>

24:47.329 --> 24:49.663
Based on the dosage
and the victim's B.M.I.,

24:49.698 --> 24:51.431
I'd estimate
the time of poisoning

24:51.467 --> 24:54.535
to be about two hours
prior to the time of death.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.303
Of course, that's an approximation.

24:56.338 --> 24:57.838
It's impossible to be exact

24:57.873 --> 24:59.540
<i>with a substance
we know so little about.</i>

24:59.575 --> 25:01.008
Well, that's good enough.
Thanks, Maura.

25:01.043 --> 25:03.076
<i>- Detective Rizzoli!
- You don't realize</i>

25:03.112 --> 25:05.615
I am a vital part
of an ongoing investigation!

25:05.735 --> 25:07.673
What is going on here?
Why aren't you in your room?

25:07.793 --> 25:10.425
- That's what I told him.
- I was looking for you.

25:10.545 --> 25:12.719
Go to your room.

25:12.755 --> 25:16.502
- What am I, 6?
- Go to your room this instant!

25:19.463 --> 25:23.131
Well, I created a time line,
if anybody cares.

25:28.472 --> 25:31.340
It's fine. It's fine.
I've got it.

25:34.645 --> 25:36.512
You did this?

25:36.547 --> 25:39.014
Why so shocked?
I am a professional just like you.

25:39.050 --> 25:41.033
Please. You and I have
nothing in common.

25:41.153 --> 25:43.085
What is your problem with me?

25:43.120 --> 25:46.789
- I'm obviously really good at my job.
- I'm sure you are.

25:46.824 --> 25:48.857
It's the way you go about it
I have a problem with.

25:48.893 --> 25:51.293
I do what needs to be done.
Don't you do the same thing?

25:51.329 --> 25:53.038
Because you seem pretty driven to me.

25:53.158 --> 25:55.922
Yeah, but I don't make up
the rules as I go along.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.766
Okay? I believe in ...

25:57.802 --> 25:59.568
in right and wrong,
in black and white,

25:59.603 --> 26:01.906
not this gray area
that you're so found of, no.

26:02.026 --> 26:04.108
I get that. You deal in murder.
Good guys and bad guys.

26:04.416 --> 26:08.744
I deal in broken marriages
and cheapskate insurance companies.

26:08.779 --> 26:10.554
Everybody thinks
they are the good guy.

26:10.519 --> 26:12.619
It's all one big gray area.

26:12.654 --> 26:17.208
And sometimes,
I really don't like it myself.

26:17.328 --> 26:19.459
You know, I was gonna be a cop
when I was younger,

26:19.495 --> 26:21.361
but sadly, that didn't work out.

26:21.396 --> 26:23.581
Am I gonna regret asking why?

26:23.701 --> 26:26.468
Well, I was obviously
too good for them.

26:29.869 --> 26:32.017
Look at that. You created
an alibi for yourself.

26:32.137 --> 26:34.461
Yeah.
What? I did?

26:35.874 --> 26:39.683
This time-stamped receipt
with your signature on it.

26:39.803 --> 26:41.680
We know now
that Dylan was poisoned

26:41.715 --> 26:44.999
two hours before he died.
Your time line indicates

26:45.119 --> 26:46.718
that he was at
his regular yoga class.

26:46.754 --> 26:49.287
This receipt states that
you were clear across town.

26:49.323 --> 26:51.223
So...

26:51.258 --> 26:55.418
- you're free to go.
- Oh.

26:56.167 --> 26:59.331
Yeah. Good.
Right.

26:59.451 --> 27:03.500
Uh... but if you need me to stay
here, I can help you with this.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.904
I think we can take it from here.

27:05.939 --> 27:09.416
- Well, can I get my stuff back?
- No...

27:09.536 --> 27:12.301
That's cool.
That works for me.

27:12.421 --> 27:13.600
Wait a second.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.339
These pictures that you took
of Dylan at the motel ...

27:15.459 --> 27:16.374
are you sure they're
in the right order?

27:16.494 --> 27:18.344
Definitely.
I checked them twice.

27:18.464 --> 27:20.061
This picture of him leaving the
motel at night ...

27:20.181 --> 27:21.955
- where'd he go?
- I think he went for a walk.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.584
I didn't leave the motel
because I was hoping

27:23.704 --> 27:24.927
the mystery lady
was gonna show up,

27:25.047 --> 27:26.865
and I did not wanna miss
the money shot.

27:26.985 --> 27:27.890
Well...

27:28.010 --> 27:31.865
Here he leaves the motel
with a travel mug.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.353
but here, when he comes back
45 minutes later,

27:34.356 --> 27:37.050
- he doesn't have it.
- Maybe he lost it?

27:37.170 --> 27:39.099
No, no, no.
I don't think so. Look...

27:39.135 --> 27:42.513
5:15 the next morning, he leaves
the motel empty-handed.

27:42.633 --> 27:45.420
When he comes back,
he's got the travel mug again.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.008
So maybe he found it.

27:48.679 --> 27:50.846
He didn't find it.
He retrieved it.

28:11.935 --> 28:15.066
The mug's a video camera.
He was filming something.

28:15.186 --> 28:17.246
Oh, we need to look at that
right now.

28:17.366 --> 28:20.575
I need to look at it right now.
You need to go home.

28:26.518 --> 28:29.586
Jerry.
Nice job.

28:39.111 --> 28:41.078
So you think Dylan Blyer
snuck in at night

28:41.113 --> 28:42.446
- and placed a camera?
- Mm-hmm.

28:42.482 --> 28:43.681
And then picked it up
the next morning

28:43.716 --> 28:45.216
so he could see
what Ward had been up to.

28:45.251 --> 28:48.182
- Here we go.
- Okay, fast-forward.

28:48.302 --> 28:50.855
Can you zoom in?

28:55.182 --> 28:56.481
There.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.440
Looks like they're importing
more than just cotton

28:58.560 --> 29:01.061
- from Africa.
- That's Ward.

29:01.181 --> 29:03.284
I'll give him this ...
he's a good liar.

29:03.404 --> 29:05.775
Well, you can't really make out
what's in the packages.

29:05.895 --> 29:07.435
No way to prove it's drugs.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.740
We still got a
unit sitting on him?

29:08.776 --> 29:10.309
- Yep.
- Good.

29:10.344 --> 29:11.543
I wanna make sure
we can find him

29:11.578 --> 29:13.679
when the dogs are finished
with the warehouse.

29:15.183 --> 29:17.083
<i>We should just
talk to my mom together.</i>

29:17.118 --> 29:20.186
You know, like a...
financial intervention.

29:20.221 --> 29:22.355
Look, why don't I just
handle it? Because you and

29:22.356 --> 29:24.490
your mother just argue
when you talk about money.

29:24.525 --> 29:27.059
My mom and I argue
when we talk about the weather.

29:29.497 --> 29:31.964
You wanted to
talk about spending?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.532
Let's talk.

29:34.036 --> 29:36.036
Well, there's nothing really
to discuss.

29:36.071 --> 29:38.238
Really?

29:38.273 --> 29:40.474
And, uh...

29:40.509 --> 29:44.444
when exactly were you planning
on wearing this?

29:44.480 --> 29:47.681
I don't know.
Eventually.

29:47.716 --> 29:50.265
Jackie o never goes out of style.

29:51.286 --> 29:54.354
Where did all
of this come from?

29:54.389 --> 29:57.090
The study closet.

29:57.210 --> 29:58.959
Must be some closet.

29:58.994 --> 30:02.729
Yeah, the real question is,
why is it stuffed in there?

30:02.735 --> 30:06.451
- Sometimes...I shop.
- This isn't shopping, Maura.

30:06.571 --> 30:09.837
This is building inventory
for your own store.

30:09.957 --> 30:11.599
Or Zoo.

30:11.719 --> 30:14.483
Wally was more of a companion
before Angela moved in.

30:14.603 --> 30:18.675
- Okay, you're dodging the question.
- And scaring us.

30:18.678 --> 30:21.512
When I'm stressed out,
I like to shop.

30:21.548 --> 30:22.980
It makes me feel better.

30:23.016 --> 30:25.220
I like that everything is new, not dead.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.675
But why are you hiding it?

30:26.677 --> 30:29.044
Because I know I don't need
a pillbox hat

30:29.079 --> 30:32.554
or a giant giraffe.
I just... need some self-control.

30:32.674 --> 30:36.253
It's okay to do something
extravagant once in a while.

30:36.373 --> 30:38.284
Ma, you know, maybe it's okay
for Maura. She's loaded.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.941
You, on the other hand,
you gotta be careful.

30:41.061 --> 30:43.341
Why do you have
such little faith in me?

30:43.461 --> 30:45.824
Ma, I just worry, that's all.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.053
You think I'm too dumb
to manage my money?

30:48.173 --> 30:49.921
Come on. No.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.607
I...
All right, fine.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.941
When I first joined the force, I...

30:55.061 --> 30:57.973
I went a little crazy and I
racked up thousands of dollars

30:57.974 --> 31:00.886
in credit card bills, and it
took me years to pay them off.

31:01.006 --> 31:03.049
Well, why didn't you tell me?
I would've helped you.

31:03.084 --> 31:04.350
Oh, yeah, sure,

31:04.386 --> 31:06.452
and let you know how badly
I screwed? Not a chance.

31:06.488 --> 31:08.052
There's no place to sit down.

31:08.172 --> 31:10.757
I guess we all have
a few financial skeletons

31:10.792 --> 31:13.293
- in our closets.
- I'll admit.

31:13.328 --> 31:16.586
I did find this one a bit surprising.

31:17.951 --> 31:21.346
Maura, it's a weapon. It doesn't
have to match your purse.

31:21.466 --> 31:24.970
Jane, accessories always
have to match.

31:26.124 --> 31:27.512
Let me see it.

31:27.632 --> 31:29.141
- Nope.
- Okay.

31:32.146 --> 31:34.146
You find anything
on Stanton Ward?

31:34.181 --> 31:36.648
Not much.
On paper, he's clean.

31:36.684 --> 31:38.850
Owns several businesses, all legit.

31:38.886 --> 31:40.152
No arrest record,

31:40.187 --> 31:42.354
no connections to any known
criminal organizations.

31:42.389 --> 31:44.690
Search of his warehouse with
drug dogs came up empty, too.

31:44.725 --> 31:46.158
I did find one thing.

31:46.193 --> 31:48.360
I was running comparisons
on Ward's holdings

31:48.395 --> 31:50.796
and the shell corp that invested
in Mamaki.

31:50.831 --> 31:53.098
- Did you get a name?
- Not for who's behind the shell corp,

31:53.133 --> 31:54.733
but a tax return for
one of Ward's companies

31:54.768 --> 31:57.469
was filed by his C.P.A. ...
Renee Levinson.

31:57.504 --> 31:59.604
Did she tell you she worked
for both Dylan Blyer

31:59.724 --> 32:02.190
- and Stanton Ward?
- She most certainly did not.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.250
There.

32:10.285 --> 32:12.852
See? Look at you go
with your girly gun.

32:12.888 --> 32:15.989
Elegant, stylish,
and extremely effective.

32:16.024 --> 32:18.525
You're right. This does help
to relieve stress.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.361
Right? So much better
than shopping, huh?

32:21.396 --> 32:22.729
It's... louder.

32:22.764 --> 32:24.431
You know if you ever get
stressed out about something,

32:24.466 --> 32:25.598
you can just come talk to me.

32:25.634 --> 32:28.384
I know. I...
uh, sometimes I forget that

32:28.504 --> 32:30.442
I don't have to solve
all of my problems on my own.

32:30.562 --> 32:32.906
Well, what's the fun of
having friends if you can't

32:32.941 --> 32:34.908
bitch and complain to them
whenever you want to?

32:34.943 --> 32:36.376
Oh, I thought the point was
that we were supposed to

32:36.411 --> 32:38.412
support each other through
positive reinforcement.

32:38.532 --> 32:42.662
Y-yeah, that. But the bitching
and complaining is so much fun.

32:46.716 --> 32:49.127
Okay, we gotta go save Frankie
from his hormones.

32:49.247 --> 32:50.931
- What?
- That's why we're here.

32:50.887 --> 32:53.021
I have to run interference.

32:53.056 --> 32:55.256
Frankie's got the hots for
the new firearms instructor.

32:55.292 --> 32:56.524
He wants to ask her out.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.893
- Really? Alexandra?
- Mm-hmm.

33:01.732 --> 33:03.432
Hey.

33:03.467 --> 33:04.666
- Hey!
- Hi!

33:04.701 --> 33:06.435
- So nice to see you again, Alexandra.
- You, too.

33:06.470 --> 33:08.303
How are the wife and kids?

33:08.338 --> 33:10.715
Oh, we're great, thanks.
Julie's loving the new house.

33:10.835 --> 33:12.407
Lots more room for the boys to play.

33:12.443 --> 33:16.411
- Oh. Well...
- Seriously?

33:22.621 --> 33:26.523
That was excellent.
I knew you could do it.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.833
Good job, bud!

33:34.032 --> 33:37.200
Hmm. Oh, I-I'm sure
I mentioned it.

33:37.236 --> 33:40.203
- You didn't.
- Well, yes...

33:40.239 --> 33:44.274
I've occasionally done a little
work for Mr. Ward over the years.

33:44.309 --> 33:46.877
What else didn't
you tell us about?

33:46.912 --> 33:48.145
I mean, what about
these investors?

33:48.180 --> 33:49.246
You had to know
those were bogus.

33:49.281 --> 33:51.190
All that cash being invested
into Mamaki.

33:51.310 --> 33:53.216
Stanton Ward was behind that,
wasn't he?

33:53.252 --> 33:55.118
I really wish that I could help,
but I'm just an accountant.

33:55.154 --> 33:58.688
I do the books and ...
and I offer advice occasionally,

33:58.724 --> 33:59.735
but that's all.

33:59.855 --> 34:02.333
You told me you handled most of
Mamaki's business affairs.

34:02.453 --> 34:04.461
Which is it, Renee?

34:04.965 --> 34:08.933
I may have overstated
my involvement before.

34:08.969 --> 34:10.835
No, I don't think so.
I think you were involved

34:10.837 --> 34:12.637
up to your eyeballs
and now you're scared.

34:12.672 --> 34:13.938
Yeah?

34:13.974 --> 34:16.774
<i>I think you need to take this.</i>

34:22.809 --> 34:24.306
Rizzoli.

34:24.426 --> 34:26.751
<i>Did you forget
how to answer your phone?</i>

34:26.786 --> 34:29.254
- Jerry?
<i>- Look, I'm being followed.</i>

34:29.289 --> 34:31.498
Look, I know that you wanna
be a part of this, but ...

34:31.619 --> 34:33.766
<i>Just turn on facetime!
Hurry up!</i>

34:36.898 --> 34:40.800
<i>See?
I told you I wasn't making it up!</i>

34:40.835 --> 34:42.301
Where are you?

34:42.337 --> 34:44.696
<i>Hey, hey, come on.
You want some of this?!</i>

34:45.572 --> 34:47.440
Try and get a location.
Right?

34:47.475 --> 34:50.159
<i>Uhh! Uhh! Hey, guys, come on.
Jane, help!</i>

34:50.159 --> 34:51.944
- Jerry!
<i>- Help!</i>

34:57.310 --> 34:58.710
I really wish I could help.

34:58.745 --> 35:00.011
Your buddy Ward just kidnapped
a private investigator

35:00.046 --> 35:01.412
that Zoe Blyer hired.

35:01.448 --> 35:03.815
- What?
- You told Ward about him, didn't you?

35:03.850 --> 35:06.017
I... I promise you,

35:06.052 --> 35:07.752
if anything happens to this guy,

35:07.788 --> 35:10.622
and I find out that you didn't
tell us everything you know,

35:10.657 --> 35:12.123
you will go down for this.

35:12.159 --> 35:13.792
We still have uniform with him, right?

35:13.827 --> 35:15.293
I already called.
He gave him the slip.

35:15.328 --> 35:16.728
Where would Ward take him?

35:16.763 --> 35:17.896
I don't know where he is.

35:17.931 --> 35:19.564
Look, Renee, I don't think
you're a bad person,

35:19.599 --> 35:22.576
but you're in a very bad situation
and you need to make it right.

35:22.696 --> 35:24.335
I never knew about the drugs,
I swear.

35:24.371 --> 35:26.385
And ... and I begged Dylan
not to confront Stanton.

35:26.505 --> 35:29.941
Renee, think.
You know Ward's other businesses.

35:29.976 --> 35:33.444
Is there anywhere else, anywhere
where Ward would take him?

35:33.564 --> 35:37.011
He owns a body shop.
Um, the Fenway Collision Center.

35:37.131 --> 35:39.884
It's not registered in his name.

35:47.829 --> 35:49.929
I want those recordings.

35:49.965 --> 35:51.331
Why do you think I have 'em?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.766
Beause my guys looked everywhere else.

35:53.802 --> 35:55.034
And I know you're the last one

35:55.070 --> 35:56.936
to see that bleeding heart Blyer alive.

35:56.972 --> 35:58.972
I give it to you, you'll just kill me.

35:59.007 --> 36:01.674
I'll kill you if you don't.

36:01.710 --> 36:03.576
I hid 'em.

36:03.696 --> 36:07.147
And if something happens to me,
it goes right to the cops.

36:07.948 --> 36:10.350
I don't think you're that smart.

36:21.864 --> 36:23.959
Not a sound.

36:43.954 --> 36:48.390
Last chance before I start
shooting holes in you.

36:48.425 --> 36:49.591
Well, that seems a bit extreme.

36:49.627 --> 36:51.093
Whatever happened to
breaking fingers?

36:51.128 --> 36:52.261
Let ... let's go old school.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.463
God, I'm tired of your mouth.

36:57.701 --> 37:01.470
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

37:01.505 --> 37:04.226
You know what your first mistake was?

37:04.346 --> 37:07.509
You should've got the recording
before you poisoned Blyer.

37:07.545 --> 37:09.311
I mean, if I gotta
be honest with you,

37:09.346 --> 37:11.219
it's really an amateur
move on your part.

37:11.339 --> 37:14.213
<i>I'm not an amateur.
We followed Blyer.</i>

37:14.333 --> 37:17.384
We knew he took that
same yoga class every day.

37:17.504 --> 37:20.004
We put enough viper
in his water bottle to kill a horse.

37:20.124 --> 37:22.779
<i>And I would've had all night
to find those recordings</i>

37:22.899 --> 37:24.170
<i>if you hadn't taken them.</i>

37:24.393 --> 37:28.261
Guess I really screwed things up
for you, huh?

37:29.698 --> 37:32.299
Well, do I have to have him
sign the confession, too?

37:32.334 --> 37:34.270
Boston homicide.
Put your hands in the air.

37:34.390 --> 37:36.503
<i>Both of you! Now!</i>

37:40.275 --> 37:43.043
Who's the smart one now?

37:55.859 --> 37:57.359
You all right?

37:57.394 --> 38:00.962
Uh, I am a little banged up,
but it's not the first time.

38:00.998 --> 38:03.699
Thanks for getting him to confess.

38:03.734 --> 38:05.634
Yeah.
I think we're a great team.

38:05.669 --> 38:07.921
You know, Rizzoli & Jankowski.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.331
No.

38:10.541 --> 38:14.409
Hey.
Thank you for finding me.

38:14.445 --> 38:16.643
Any time.

38:16.763 --> 38:19.065
Stay out of trouble, okay?

38:19.185 --> 38:22.984
Uh, hey. I don't suppose there's
a reward for this, right?

38:23.711 --> 38:26.133
All right, forget about it.

38:26.253 --> 38:29.825
Look, I'm just happy
helping Boston's finest.

38:32.931 --> 38:36.366
I don't know about P.I.s.
Never feel like I can trust them.

38:36.401 --> 38:40.270
I don't know.
It's kind of a gray area.

38:47.246 --> 38:49.180
Okay, this is the "return" pile,

38:49.215 --> 38:51.148
and that is the "donation" pile.

38:51.184 --> 38:53.951
- Mm-hmm
- And this is an "Angela" pile.

38:55.455 --> 38:57.188
Okay, I thought
we weren't gonna go crazy

38:57.223 --> 38:59.623
with the foo-foo dinners anymore.

38:59.659 --> 39:02.827
Yes, uh, but Angela had a point,
that every now and then,

39:02.862 --> 39:05.367
we deserve to treat ourselves
to something fancy.

39:05.487 --> 39:08.252
- You're taking her side now?
- Stop worrying.

39:08.372 --> 39:10.134
I cut up two of the credit cards,

39:10.169 --> 39:12.879
and the one I kept,
I'm gonna pay off every month.

39:12.999 --> 39:16.952
You could stand a little crazy
once in a while yourself.

39:17.072 --> 39:20.437
Between my job and my family,
I got enough crazy for anybody.

39:20.447 --> 39:23.715
- Right, Wally?
- Oh, no, Jane, you're taking it too far.

39:23.751 --> 39:25.717
Do not make him take sides.

39:25.753 --> 39:28.120
Okay, but, ma, you gotta
promise that you won't ...

39:28.155 --> 39:31.456
- Whoa! Is that risotto?
- From Turturro's.

39:31.492 --> 39:32.691
But don't feel like you have to eat it.

39:32.726 --> 39:35.027
I mean, if it's too expensive
for you...

39:35.062 --> 39:37.329
Caprese! And...

39:37.449 --> 39:39.298
- Pesto gnocchi!
- Yes.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.767
Oh, I love pesto!
Well, it's ... it's like

39:41.802 --> 39:45.070
I always say ... What's ...
What's the point in making money

39:45.105 --> 39:46.371
if you're not gonna
treat yourself, right?

39:46.491 --> 39:48.573
I think you would get in a program.

39:48.693 --> 39:50.938
Oh, no, no. Don't ...
You can't eat it out of the plastic.

39:51.058 --> 39:52.567
- Why not?
- Put it on a plate.

39:52.687 --> 39:54.680
- Why? It's right here.
- Tell her. Stop her.

39:54.681 --> 39:56.964
- No! I can't...
- I don't.
