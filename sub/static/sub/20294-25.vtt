07:02.967 --> 07:04.833
MY SISTER IS A POLICE

13:02.500 --> 13:04.900

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED.

13:35.233 --> 13:36.633
I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE,

POCKET KNIFE, RIGHT FRONT.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.467

14:28.567 --> 14:30.500
-JUST WOUND UP
AFTER CHASING ONE.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.200
-YOU WERE CHASING

15:08.867 --> 15:12.133
I'VE DONE A LOT OF ELECTRICAL

FIBER OPTICS LOOK LIKE.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.900
I SHOULD HAVE PAID
CLOSER ATTENTION TO IT.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.967
-OKAY.

15:36.433 --> 15:38.700
-YOU WERE JUST CHASING SOMEBODY
WITHOUT SHOES ON?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.567
-YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
-ALL THE WAY A MILE FROM HERE?

15:40.667 --> 15:43.233
WHY DID YOU STRAP ON
WITH YOUR GUN
TO GO AFTER THIS...

15:43.333 --> 15:44.767
-I NEEDED TO CARRY MY FIREARM.

15:44.867 --> 15:48.200
-THIS MYSTERY PERSON
YOU'RE CHASING WITH A GUN.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.167
-I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN PULLED IT.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.400
I JUST WANTED TO GET
SOME PLATE NUMBERS AND STUFF.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.267
AND THEY WERE ALL, LIKE, HIGH.

15:54.367 --> 15:58.567
-OKAY, SO YOU WERE GONNA GET
PLATE NUMBERS WITH A FIREARM
ON YOUR SIDE--

15:58.667 --> 16:00.067
-I CARRY IT ALL THE TIME.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.633
-WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU USED ALCOHOL,

16:02.733 --> 16:04.467
OR MARIJUANA,

16:04.567 --> 16:06.100
OR METH,

16:06.200 --> 16:07.400
OR BATH SALTS?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.800
-SALTS. THE OTHER DAY.
-SALTS?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.333
YOU HAD SOME SALTS?
-YES, SIR.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.333
-OKAY.
-AND WHAT SUCKS

16:12.433 --> 16:13.667
IS MY SON'S FRIEND
GOT ME ON 'EM.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.100
I'VE ONLY BEEN ON 'EM
FOR TWO WEEKS.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.767
I WOULD NEVER DO 'EM AGAIN.

16:16.867 --> 16:22.067
-IN YOUR-- IN YOUR RIGHT MIND,
THE BEST YOU CAN COME UP WITH
RIGHT NOW,

16:22.133 --> 16:25.067
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS
HAPPENING, OR DO YOU THINK THIS
IS AN EFFECT FROM THE SALTS?

16:25.167 --> 16:28.633
-UH, I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH SALTS
TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF AN EFFECT.

16:28.733 --> 16:31.533
-LET ME TELL YOU WHAT,
THIS STUFF IS AFFECTING YOU.

16:31.633 --> 16:33.433
AND I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU--

16:33.533 --> 16:35.867
-I WILL STOP. I GIVE YOU MY WORD
AS A MARINE, AS A MAN.
-I WILL--

16:35.967 --> 16:37.667
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

16:37.767 --> 16:39.600
THE STUFF THAT YOU THINK
IS GOING ON

16:39.700 --> 16:41.500
IS ALL FABRICATED UP HERE.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.100
THAT'S WHAT SALTS DO.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.700
THIS IS THE REALITY OF IT.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.933
-I'M NOT GONNA DISAGREE
WITH YOU, SIR,

16:49.067 --> 16:50.500
BUT IF IT'S HAPPENING,

16:50.600 --> 16:52.267
I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE THEY WERE
DRILLING THEM IN BACK
BY THE POOL.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.467
-WE JUST HAD A CALL
FROM ANOTHER CITIZEN

16:54.567 --> 16:56.600
THAT SAID YOU WERE FRANTICALLY
RUNNING DOWN THE ROAD,

16:56.700 --> 16:59.133
THROWING YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR
AND YOU HAD YOUR FIREARM
ON YOU,

16:59.233 --> 17:00.867
AND THEY WERE CONCERNED
FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.900
-I WAS LETTING THEM KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
-LETTING WHO KNOW?

17:03.067 --> 17:03.967
-HUH?
-LETTING WHO KNOW?

17:04.067 --> 17:05.067
-THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.467
-ABOUT WHAT?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.133
-THE DRILLING
IN THE BATH SALTS.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.367
OR, NOT THE BATH SALTS, SORRY,

17:09.467 --> 17:11.933
OF THE FIBER OPTICS.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.800
-OKAY, THAT THEY'RE PUTTING
FIBER OPTIC LINES
INTO THIS HOUSE?

17:14.900 --> 17:17.067
-YEAH. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.300
-YOU CAN SEE ONE RIGHT NOW?

17:18.400 --> 17:19.433
-YES, SIR.

17:19.533 --> 17:21.367
WELL, I MIGHT HAVE
TO LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.867
BUT YES, SIR, I CAN PROBABLY
FIND ONE RIGHT HERE
IN THIS DRIVEWAY.

17:23.967 --> 17:25.567
UH, MAILBOXES,

17:25.667 --> 17:27.367
I CAN FIND 'EM
ON MY TRUCK.

17:27.467 --> 17:31.067
-POINT ONE OUT TO ME,
'CAUSE I'M NOT SEEING
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.200
-SEE HOW THEY'RE CRUSHED IN.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.133
I KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM
LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT...

17:35.233 --> 17:36.967
-SO, POINT WITH YOUR FINGER.
-OKAY.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.267
-SO, THAT'S IT?

17:38.367 --> 17:40.067
-IT COULD BE. OR A STEM.

17:40.167 --> 17:43.067
THAT COULD BE A FIBER OPTIC
OR A SEED.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.367
-A FIBER OPTIC SEED?

17:44.467 --> 17:46.500
-NO, FIBER OPTIC LINE.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.733
AND I'VE EVEN GOT--
-YEAH.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.467
I'M AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE.

17:49.567 --> 17:51.233
-YES, SIR, SO AM I.
-VERY AWARE.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.467
BUT HOW-- HOW DOES THIS--

17:55.767 --> 17:59.633
HOW DOES THAT EVEN
RESEMBLE A FIBER OPTIC LINE?

17:59.733 --> 18:01.733
-WELL, I'D HAVE
TO TOUCH IT. I--
-HEY, WAYNE?

18:01.833 --> 18:03.767
-I MEAN, SOME OF THEM
ARE BIODEGRADABLE TOO.
-(unintelligible)

18:03.867 --> 18:05.900
THEY'RE MADE
WITH BIODEGRADABLE STUFF.
-HEY,

18:06.067 --> 18:08.233
HE'S ADMITTED HE'S ON
SALTS, IT'S A TRIP.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.100
-YEAH? OH, OKAY.
-I GIVE YOU MY WORD
AS A MARINE.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.567
-WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL YOUR
FORMER MARINE BUDDIES
WOULD THINK RIGHT NOW...

18:12.667 --> 18:14.367
-OH, MY GOD.
-...IF THEY SAW YOU
IN THIS CONDITION?

18:14.467 --> 18:16.733
-I'D FEEL EMBARRASSED.
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.233
-OKAY, THEN, WITH THAT
IN ITSELF,

18:19.333 --> 18:21.167
ISN'T THAT TIME TO GET CLEAN?
-YES, SIR.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.333
AND I CAN DO IT TOMORROW,
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.067
-HAVE YOU USED UP
ALL THE SALTS YOU HAD?

18:25.133 --> 18:26.933
-UH, NO, SIR.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.433
-YOU HAVEN'T USED THEM ALL UP?
-NO, SIR.

18:28.533 --> 18:31.200
-HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT?
-RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.833
BLACK LITTLE BAGGIE.
-OKAY.

18:34.567 --> 18:35.533
-LET ME ASK YOU THIS,

18:35.633 --> 18:37.267
WHEN DID YOU USE THESE SALTS?

18:37.367 --> 18:39.533
-UH, ALL DAY TODAY,
IN THE LAST--

18:39.633 --> 18:41.800
-HOW ARE YOU TAKING THEM?
YOU JUST SMOKING 'EM?
-SMOKING 'EM.

18:41.900 --> 18:42.933
-ON WHAT, FOIL? OR A PIPE?

18:43.067 --> 18:44.767
-ON FOIL, SIR.
-FOIL.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.067
SO, THAT'S THE FOIL IN THERE?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.300
-YES, SIR.
-WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM FROM?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.200
-MY SON.
-YOUR SON.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.567
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE BACK.

18:50.667 --> 18:51.967
SMALL OF YOUR BACK.
-YES, SIR.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.633
-SPREAD YOUR FEET WIDE FOR ME.

18:53.733 --> 18:57.100
-THE STUFF YOU POINTED OUT HERE
ON THE SIDEWALK ISN'T EVEN
FIBER OPTIC LINES.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.867
-THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

18:58.967 --> 19:02.067
THEY CAN MAKE THE FIBER OPTIC
INTO ANY SIZE, DIAMETER THEY
WANT, SOME SHAPES.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.100
-YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.733
YOU BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 14 DAYS STRAIGHT,

19:05.833 --> 19:08.600
AND I'M 100% CERTAIN THAT
YOU'RE NOT CHASING ANYBODY.

19:08.700 --> 19:09.933
YOU'RE CHASING GHOSTS.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.933
-WE JUST HAD ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
THAT JUST CAME UP TO ME.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.700
-FIGURED HE WAS THE ONE
THAT CALLED IN ON ME.
-YEAH, YOU SCARED HIM TO DEATH.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.067
-I WAS THERE TO ACTUALLY
PROTECT HIM AND HIS WIFE

19:17.133 --> 19:20.400
UNTIL I SEEN THE FIBER,
THE PIECES ON TOP OF HER CAR.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.767
-EVEN IF THEY WERE DRILLING
LINES INTO THE HOUSE,

19:22.867 --> 19:24.167
HOW DOES THAT ENDANGER YOU?

19:24.267 --> 19:25.767
-IT DOESN'T.

19:25.867 --> 19:28.267
THESE GUYS, I MEAN,
I CONSIDER THEM CRIMINALS.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.700
IT'S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.100
UM...

19:32.633 --> 19:34.867
ANY CRIME, AND THAT'S WHY
I SAID

19:34.967 --> 19:36.267
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE FIREARM OFF.

19:36.367 --> 19:37.633
-OKAY.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.167
-WELL, I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.700
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL
FOR POSSESSION OF
A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE

19:41.800 --> 19:43.333
AND POSSESSION
OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.767
-I KNOW, BUT I--
-I KNOW THIS MAY BE HARD
FOR YOU TO GRASP RIGHT NOW,

19:45.867 --> 19:49.100
BUT ALL THESE FIBER OPTICS,
IT'S ALL A RESULT OF THE SALTS
THAT YOU'RE SMOKING.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.600
IT'S A HALLUCINOGEN.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.633
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.300
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.067
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.100
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.167
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.667 --> 20:07.600
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.200
-(theme music playing)
