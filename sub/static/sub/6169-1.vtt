00:19.066 --> 00:20.532
<i>Miss Pettigrew,</i>

00:20.533 --> 00:23.059
<i>I was warned of your
stubbornness and impertinence,</i>

00:23.136 --> 00:26.026
<i>and I should have known
better when you were called the</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.300
<i>"governess of last resort."</i>

00:27.374 --> 00:30.207
<i>But I had no idea
of your utter unsuitability.</i>

00:30.277 --> 00:32.744
<i>You are dismissed.
- But, Mrs. Brummegan...</i>

00:32.813 --> 00:33.281
<i>Away!</i>

00:33.282 --> 00:34.804
Allow me one last chance...

00:34.881 --> 00:36.906
<i>Goodbye, Miss Pettigrew.</i>

00:44.424 --> 00:46.790
I'm owed
a week's wages.

01:31.605 --> 01:33.896
I say! I'm terribly sorry!
I do apologize.

01:33.897 --> 01:34.802
Oh, no! My things!

01:34.875 --> 01:35.265
My things!

01:35.266 --> 01:36.240
Let me help you with that.

01:36.309 --> 01:39.140
They'll have me back
in prison for this.

01:39.141 --> 01:39.278
Oh!

01:39.346 --> 01:41.439
Oh, nothing serious.
Well, when I say serious, I...

01:41.515 --> 01:42.539
No.

01:43.417 --> 01:44.884
Wait! Your...

01:45.652 --> 01:47.244
Your belongings!

01:47.320 --> 01:48.685
Sorry!

02:25.459 --> 02:26.483
Gerry?

02:26.560 --> 02:30.587
Edythe, if you can keep your hands
off him for just two seconds...

02:30.664 --> 02:32.598
We're getting our
own cab, thank you.

02:34.434 --> 02:36.368
That's naughty!

02:45.011 --> 02:47.275
Let's get out
of here, Gerry.

03:29.022 --> 03:31.354
Washburns.
Jane, aged five.

03:31.424 --> 03:33.756
Lovely girl.
- Lost in the park...

03:33.827 --> 03:36.014
Independence.
That's all that girl needs...

03:36.015 --> 03:36.660
For six hours?

03:36.730 --> 03:39.221
The Randle boys,
John and Robin.

03:39.299 --> 03:43.463
<i>" Wrestled retired Colonel Johnson to
the floor outside Fortnum and Mason's,</i>

03:43.537 --> 03:47.439
<i>" shouting, 'Nazi warmonger'
because..." And I quote,</i>

03:47.507 --> 03:50.340
<i>" Miss Pettigrew thought
he was a German spy."</i>

03:50.410 --> 03:51.741
A little joke.

03:51.811 --> 03:54.302
<i>" Ambulance called.
Police called."</i>

03:55.215 --> 03:57.115
Yes. And now
the Brummegans.

03:57.183 --> 04:00.812
Miss Pettigrew,
we live in uncertain times.

04:01.288 --> 04:03.813
My goodness, there
could be a war any day.

04:03.890 --> 04:05.881
Do you think that work
is easy to find?

04:05.959 --> 04:08.553
No, no.
Certainly not, Miss Holt.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.687
But Mrs. Brummegan was...

04:11.565 --> 04:14.261
Well, fond of a sherry,
if you take my meaning.

04:14.334 --> 04:16.392
As a vicar's daughter,
I found her rather difficult.

04:16.469 --> 04:19.267
No, she found you rather
difficult, Miss Pettigrew.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.500
And that is, I'm afraid,
a recurring theme.

04:21.575 --> 04:23.543
Miss Holt?
- Yes, Jilly?

04:23.610 --> 04:27.546
The Lafosse household rang
last night. Still looking.

04:27.614 --> 04:29.582
Thank you. Yes, I
won't be a moment.

04:29.649 --> 04:30.822
A person can change.

04:30.823 --> 04:32.641
I haven't seen any sign of that.

04:32.719 --> 04:34.687
She could stop drinking.

04:34.754 --> 04:37.552
Our clients don't adapt to
suit your needs, Miss Pettigrew,

04:37.624 --> 04:39.057
you adapt to them!

04:39.125 --> 04:40.956
I am trying,
Miss Holt. Really.

04:41.027 --> 04:43.325
Give me one last chance.
You won't regret it.

04:43.396 --> 04:46.092
My dear woman, I
already have. Thrice.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.691
I'm afraid we have nothing
suitable for you at the moment.

04:48.768 --> 04:50.998
Good day, Miss Pettigrew.
- Shall I come back tomorrow?

04:51.071 --> 04:52.595
The situation is most
unlikely to have changed.

04:52.672 --> 04:53.812
The day after?

04:53.813 --> 04:56.335
Only if you desire the exercise.

04:56.409 --> 04:59.207
Miss Holt.
Please, I implore you.

04:59.579 --> 05:01.012
Yes, Miss Holt?

05:01.081 --> 05:04.278
Miss Darlington is finishing with
Carole Lombard this week, isn't she?

05:04.784 --> 05:07.753
She would be perfect for the
Lafosse residence, don't you think?

05:07.821 --> 05:09.652
I think she would
be an excellent choice.

05:09.723 --> 05:11.281
Can you refer
to her file for me?

05:11.358 --> 05:12.347
Certainly.

05:18.965 --> 05:19.954
Thank you.

05:22.636 --> 05:24.866
I said good day,
Miss Pettigrew.

05:24.938 --> 05:26.235
Good day.

05:50.697 --> 05:52.164
Amazing.

06:31.905 --> 06:32.997
Hi.

06:33.773 --> 06:35.468
I have come
from Miss Holt's Agency.

06:36.576 --> 06:38.237
What time is it?

06:39.012 --> 06:40.707
It's five minutes
past 10:00.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.878
10:00?
- Five minutes past.

06:44.918 --> 06:47.182
In the morning?
- I believe so.

06:48.388 --> 06:49.753
Oh, God!

07:13.613 --> 07:15.843
Oh, my God,
look at the place.

07:15.915 --> 07:17.906
I was given to believe
you were expecting me.

07:17.984 --> 07:19.781
Miss Holt's
Employment Agency?

07:19.853 --> 07:21.980
Darn right, honey.
And not a moment too soon.

07:25.725 --> 07:27.056
Allow me.

07:30.897 --> 07:31.921
Neat!

07:31.998 --> 07:33.090
Time?

07:33.466 --> 07:34.831
Six minutes
past 10:00.

07:34.901 --> 07:36.562
Can I be of any
further assistance?

07:36.636 --> 07:39.298
Not unless you can get Phil out of
bed in the next two minutes, you can't.

07:39.372 --> 07:41.704
I've known my share of
naughty boys who oversleep.

07:41.775 --> 07:43.003
You too, huh?

07:43.643 --> 07:46.271
Phil! It's time
to wake up, darling!

07:46.346 --> 07:47.677
Damn it!
- Allow me.

07:47.747 --> 07:49.772
I can get your boy up
and dressed in no time.

07:49.849 --> 07:50.941
You could? Really?

07:51.017 --> 07:52.780
Certainly.
- Angel.

07:52.852 --> 07:54.877
One must not stand for
any nonsense, that's all.

07:54.954 --> 07:56.387
They just need to know
who's in charge.

07:56.456 --> 07:58.424
First door at the top
of the stairs.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.458
Philip?

08:07.901 --> 08:09.869
Rise and shine, Philip!

08:11.571 --> 08:15.166
As I said to your mother, I
won't stand for any nonsense.

08:16.309 --> 08:18.869
You naughty boy, get up!

08:22.882 --> 08:25.646
I kind of am up,
as you can see.

08:27.053 --> 08:28.486
Oh, golly!

08:35.528 --> 08:38.496
Excuse me, Mrs. Lafosse,
may I speak to you?

08:38.565 --> 08:39.589
Mrs. Lafosse...

08:40.767 --> 08:42.325
Oh, heavens!

08:42.402 --> 08:46.566
Answer that, will you? If it's
Nick, tell him... Tell him I'm dead.

08:55.215 --> 08:59.549
Good morning, this is Miss Holt
here, of Holt's Employment Agency.

08:59.619 --> 09:04.147
I've just rung to say that one of our
best women is on her way over to you now.

09:06.826 --> 09:07.166
Hello?

09:07.167 --> 09:10.227
No, no,
no! That won't be necessary.

09:11.998 --> 09:15.365
I'm afraid that
Mrs. Lafosse is dead.

09:16.536 --> 09:17.935
Goodbye.

09:32.318 --> 09:33.751
Don't really do kitchens.
Hmm.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.617
Any luck with Phil?

09:38.691 --> 09:40.989
I'm so sorry, Mrs.
Lafosse... Delysia.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.895
Delysia, I'm afraid I walked in
on your guest in a state of nature.

09:46.332 --> 09:49.733
I fear that I have outraged
his sense of propriety.

09:49.802 --> 09:52.396
Oh, no, Phil doesn't
have one of those.

09:52.472 --> 09:55.964
He's a much bigger boy
than I had expected.

09:56.042 --> 09:58.567
Oh, you noticed.
He is, isn't he?

09:58.645 --> 09:59.634
Uh...

10:08.488 --> 10:09.477
Hello?

10:10.256 --> 10:11.518
Darling!

10:26.039 --> 10:27.301
Really?

10:27.373 --> 10:28.431
Mmm-hmm.

10:29.242 --> 10:30.539
You, too.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.544
He's at the club.

10:41.621 --> 10:43.418
Be here in 10 minutes.
Oh, God.

10:43.489 --> 10:44.854
Who?
- Nick!

10:45.191 --> 10:46.624
Another man?

10:46.693 --> 10:48.752
Well, of course
another man!

10:48.828 --> 10:49.852
Jeepers.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.727
I'm afraid there has been
a misunderstanding.

10:52.799 --> 10:56.758
I can see the problem clearly
now and I really must be going.

10:56.836 --> 10:58.133
You do?

10:58.204 --> 11:00.570
Pardon?
See the problem. Really?

11:00.640 --> 11:03.200
Well, yes.
- I knew it.

11:03.776 --> 11:06.802
From the moment I set eyes on you, I just
knew I could trust you. I can, can't I?

11:06.879 --> 11:09.074
Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

11:09.882 --> 11:11.247
Thank you.
You've saved my life.

11:11.317 --> 11:12.579
Have I?
- Hmm.

11:13.353 --> 11:15.150
A two-pronged attack
should do it. Let's go.

11:17.056 --> 11:20.048
Though I don't think you
should mention about Nick.

11:22.128 --> 11:24.221
Or Michael.
- Michael?

11:24.297 --> 11:26.857
Is he your son?
- My son? Lord, no.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.662
Michael wants
to marry me.

11:28.768 --> 11:29.826
Another man?

11:31.070 --> 11:32.196
You don't have to wake
the neighbors about it.

11:32.271 --> 11:34.432
Besides, that's only three.

11:36.142 --> 11:38.269
Phil's rather free
about where he undresses.

11:38.344 --> 11:41.336
He's a theater producer.
Well, his father is.

11:41.414 --> 11:44.383
Phil's got his first show on at
the Ambassador. I've got the lead.

11:44.450 --> 11:45.678
Well...

11:45.952 --> 11:48.113
I'm pretty sure
I have now.

11:56.029 --> 11:57.394
Hello again.

11:57.463 --> 11:59.454
Awfully sorry about earlier. I
thought you were someone else.

11:59.532 --> 12:01.500
That is some relief,
I suppose.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.559
Jolly nice to meet you, dear
lady, but who the devil are you?

12:04.637 --> 12:06.662
Who is she, gorgeous?

12:06.739 --> 12:07.865
She's, um...

12:09.108 --> 12:12.168
You know, I'm not
altogether sure.

12:12.245 --> 12:14.975
Pettigrew.
Guinevere Pettigrew.

12:15.715 --> 12:17.114
Guinevere.

12:17.183 --> 12:18.616
Guinevere. Wow.

12:18.684 --> 12:20.618
Yes, but who is she?

12:21.187 --> 12:23.417
What in the world is she doing
in this particular bedroom

12:23.489 --> 12:25.252
when you are
so obviously starkers

12:25.324 --> 12:27.121
beneath that delightful
gown, don't you know?

12:27.193 --> 12:28.717
We have...

12:29.429 --> 12:30.453
An engagement.
- A meeting.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.088
Meeting. Important meeting.
- Indeed we do. In 20.

12:32.165 --> 12:33.189
Two...
- Twenty-two.

12:33.266 --> 12:36.064
Not 22, Guinevere,
dearest. Two minutes.

12:37.537 --> 12:38.936
What the dickens
can be as important

12:39.005 --> 12:41.735
as another hour in bed
with young Philip-me-lad?

12:41.808 --> 12:43.241
You don't mind,
do you, Guinevere?

12:43.309 --> 12:45.368
It's all a bit new to me,
and it's devilish good fun.

12:45.445 --> 12:47.936
Besides, I have
nothing till lunch.

12:48.014 --> 12:49.413
Come back to bed,
beautiful.

12:56.155 --> 12:58.180
Baby, baby, I'd
love to, but I can't.

12:58.257 --> 13:02.284
Come on, it's an awfully good
cure for a hangover, I'm told.

13:02.361 --> 13:04.022
Edythe's lingerie
show is at 11:00.

13:04.097 --> 13:06.156
Anyway, haven't you
got to get ready?

13:06.232 --> 13:08.860
Who are you lunching?
- Nobody, really.

13:08.935 --> 13:11.403
Charlotte Warren.
The Rabbit?

13:11.471 --> 13:13.962
Why? She run out of carrots?
- Sweetie-pops...

13:14.040 --> 13:16.099
But you said the lead was mine.
Phil, honey, you promised!

13:16.175 --> 13:18.643
It is. It is. I'm sure it
is. You're the one, baby.

13:18.711 --> 13:20.508
I just have to
clear it with Daddy,

13:20.580 --> 13:22.377
being the bounder with
the checkbook and all.

13:22.448 --> 13:26.407
You know, he wants me to meet
her. Amazing voice, apparently.

13:26.486 --> 13:27.817
If you like
air-raid sirens.

13:27.887 --> 13:30.515
It's just lunch, darling.
Come on, Delysia.

13:30.590 --> 13:34.720
Remind your producer why you're
right for such a passionate part.

13:38.364 --> 13:39.956
Charlotte Warren
the actress?

13:40.032 --> 13:41.056
Know her, what?

13:41.134 --> 13:43.796
I did happen to see her last
night on Shaftesbury Avenue.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.428
With who?
- Who with?

13:45.505 --> 13:47.530
A man.
- Producer?

13:47.607 --> 13:48.767
Mmm.
- Spivvy fellow?

13:48.841 --> 13:50.604
Mmm.
- Nasty side-parting?

13:50.710 --> 13:51.734
Mmm.

13:51.811 --> 13:53.073
I knew it!

13:53.146 --> 13:56.445
Danny ruddy Greenwood,
dash it all. On the poach.

13:57.116 --> 13:58.378
Well, we'll see
about that.

13:58.451 --> 14:03.115
Oh, Phil, you can't think that
Charlotte Warren is right for Hortensia?

14:03.189 --> 14:05.817
Not with that
damp little nose.

14:20.973 --> 14:22.964
Jacket?
- Behind you.

14:25.645 --> 14:28.045
A quick egg
and I'm off.

14:28.114 --> 14:30.173
I regret
we're out of eggs.

14:30.249 --> 14:31.910
You know this?
- I'm afraid I do.

14:31.984 --> 14:33.349
Bacon?
- So sorry, no.

14:33.419 --> 14:34.613
Sausage?
- If only.

14:34.687 --> 14:36.177
Smoked haddock fillets?
- Definitely not.

14:36.255 --> 14:37.313
Toast.

14:38.457 --> 14:41.187
I saw the baker's girl
deliver a loaf yesterday.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.659
Allow me.

14:49.068 --> 14:52.265
Guinevere, you've got to get him
out of here. We're on a deadline.

14:52.338 --> 14:54.636
Toast is only
two minutes.

14:54.707 --> 14:56.937
I realize it is not
my place, but

14:57.009 --> 15:00.536
isn't it possible simply not to
answer the door to this Nick fellow?

15:00.613 --> 15:02.547
Oh, I can't do that.
- Why?

15:02.615 --> 15:04.207
It's his flat.
- Oh.

15:05.351 --> 15:07.478
Jeepers, he's early!

15:29.609 --> 15:30.735
Toast!

15:30.810 --> 15:32.300
Marvelous.

15:32.878 --> 15:34.243
Tie?

15:34.313 --> 15:36.713
Any tea on the go,
perchance?

15:37.750 --> 15:38.842
Sweets,

15:38.918 --> 15:40.408
Danny Greenwood
is at this very second,

15:40.486 --> 15:42.511
sending flowers around to
Charlotte's little warren.

15:42.588 --> 15:44.351
You think so?

15:44.423 --> 15:47.187
That does seem to be the
producer's modus operandi.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.990
It does, doesn't it?
You know the business, what?

15:50.062 --> 15:52.121
Not that you're in the least bit
interested in Charlotte Warren.

15:52.198 --> 15:54.792
No. No. Darling, you're the
one for me. You know that.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.664
And I don't just
mean on the stage.

15:56.769 --> 15:57.758
I say.

15:59.138 --> 16:00.196
What?
- Delysia?

16:00.273 --> 16:01.535
Clean it up.
- Delysia.

16:13.686 --> 16:16.280
I can't go yet. I have
something important to say.

16:16.355 --> 16:18.346
Just... Right now?

16:18.424 --> 16:20.824
Delysia...
- Yes, my sweets?

16:21.861 --> 16:23.260
I love you.

16:28.501 --> 16:30.298
Fiddlesticks,
working relationships.

16:30.369 --> 16:32.166
You and me.
How about it, old girl?

16:44.050 --> 16:46.848
Don't let any rabbits
under your fence.

16:47.820 --> 16:48.946
Bye.

16:49.822 --> 16:51.084
Delysia?

17:01.434 --> 17:02.799
Lift up the spout?

17:02.868 --> 17:04.836
I rather think so, yes.

17:12.478 --> 17:14.343
Delysia? Is that you?

17:17.282 --> 17:19.376
He saw the gown,
damn it.

17:19.452 --> 17:21.579
I believe we
have made it.

17:21.654 --> 17:24.054
You're a bona fide
genius, Guinevere!

17:24.123 --> 17:25.750
Miss Lafosse,

17:25.825 --> 17:30.956
it has been a most exciting, one might
say exhilarating experience, meeting you,

17:31.430 --> 17:36.026
though I can't help feeling one
fraught with moral complexity.

17:36.469 --> 17:39.870
But now that the crisis has been
averted, I simply must take my leave.

17:39.939 --> 17:43.238
What? Oh, you can't go. Please
don't go. The crisis is ongoing.

17:43.309 --> 17:43.996
Goodness.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.210
Guinevere...
Miss Pettigrew...

17:46.746 --> 17:50.182
I don't know what I'd do
if you went. I beg you.

17:50.249 --> 17:51.273
It's Nick.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.715
I need saving.
- Saving?

17:52.785 --> 17:55.879
Mmm-hmm. Have you ever been
hypnotized by a snake, Guinevere?

17:55.955 --> 17:57.013
I don't believe so, no.

17:57.089 --> 17:59.523
Well, it's what they do
to small furry animals.

17:59.592 --> 18:03.084
The snake fixes the animal with
its eyes, so it has no will.

18:03.162 --> 18:04.959
It stays when it
should be running.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.555
It wants to stay,
even if it means death.

18:07.633 --> 18:10.568
And I am that
small furry animal.

18:10.636 --> 18:15.073
And Nick Calderelli, coming up the
stairs this very minute, is that snake.

18:15.141 --> 18:18.736
When he's here, I just... I can't
resist him. And he's bad for me.

18:18.811 --> 18:22.110
So bad. And when I waver,
and I will waver,

18:22.181 --> 18:23.705
I need you
to be strong for me.

18:29.755 --> 18:31.518
Please. Stay.

18:34.126 --> 18:37.459
I can see I have no choice.
You're clearly in danger.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.122
Oh, thank you!

18:44.403 --> 18:47.270
But I'm afraid it is you
who must be strong.

18:47.339 --> 18:49.136
You're right. I must.

18:49.775 --> 18:51.072
The time has come
to break it off.

18:51.143 --> 18:53.941
And with you beside me,
I feel strong,

18:54.013 --> 18:55.139
confident, firm.

18:55.981 --> 19:00.509
There is something so sensual about fur
next to the skin, don't you think? Mmm!

19:00.586 --> 19:03.214
Miss Lafosse,
you're slipping already.

19:03.823 --> 19:05.882
Strong, confident, firm.

19:06.392 --> 19:08.622
I know! But I can't help it.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.424
But I must.

19:12.665 --> 19:13.757
Nick!

19:13.833 --> 19:16.666
I feel like I've just climbed bloody
Everest. The lift's on the blink.

19:19.238 --> 19:20.603
Darling.

19:21.974 --> 19:23.236
It's you!

19:23.309 --> 19:25.004
That wasn't you, was it?
- Me?

19:25.077 --> 19:27.136
In the lift?
- The lift?

19:27.446 --> 19:31.177
Lift? Oh, you mean elevator.
- That's exactly what I...

19:33.252 --> 19:34.651
I didn't know
you had company.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.518
But, Nick, I get so
lonely when you're away.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.506
This is...

19:38.507 --> 19:41.253
Pettigrew.
Guinevere Pettigrew.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.989
A pleasure, Miss
Pettigrew, I'm sure.

19:44.497 --> 19:46.089
And you are,
what, a friend?

19:46.165 --> 19:48.656
I am Miss Lafosse's new
governess... Social secretary.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.361
Social secretary.

19:50.436 --> 19:51.801
Really?

19:52.605 --> 19:55.369
Isn't it a little early
for camouflage?

19:55.441 --> 19:57.341
I beg your pardon?

19:57.409 --> 19:58.706
I haven't had
the opportunity...

19:58.777 --> 20:00.176
It's nice to meet you,
Miss Pettigrew,

20:00.246 --> 20:02.305
but D and I haven't seen
each other for three weeks.

20:02.381 --> 20:04.474
Got a lot of
catching up to do.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.711
So if you
wouldn't mind.

20:07.486 --> 20:10.148
But of course.
Good day.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.489
But, Nick, darling!
- What?

20:17.563 --> 20:19.793
Well, I've got a fashion show
to get to. Haven't I, Guinevere?

20:19.865 --> 20:24.529
Fashion show be damned. Who
needs clothes, eh, gorgeous?

20:25.137 --> 20:28.504
Damned or not, I'm afraid Miss
Lafosse has accepted the invitation.

20:28.574 --> 20:30.235
Well, cancel.

20:30.309 --> 20:31.469
Come on, darling.

20:31.544 --> 20:32.568
Close the door
on your way out.

20:32.645 --> 20:34.613
I'm sure that we can schedule
something for later in the week.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.234
I beg your pardon?

20:35.235 --> 20:36.341
I think that Miss
Lafosse has an hour

20:36.415 --> 20:38.950
Wednesday at 9:30.
Shall I pencil it in?

20:38.951 --> 20:40.249
No. I'm penciling now.

20:40.319 --> 20:42.412
Nick, darling, I'm afraid
that Guinevere's right.

20:42.488 --> 20:44.922
I'm terribly busy
this morning.

20:46.825 --> 20:47.814
Oh.

21:03.709 --> 21:05.336
You haven't...

21:07.479 --> 21:09.413
You haven't had any
other guests, have you?

21:09.481 --> 21:12.314
No, darling.
Just us girls together.

21:12.785 --> 21:15.652
I thought I saw Phil
Goldman's car outside.

21:15.721 --> 21:17.052
Phil?
- Goldman.

21:17.122 --> 21:18.680
Do we know him?

21:19.124 --> 21:21.251
Andy Goldman's
idiot boy.

21:21.961 --> 21:26.022
Pouring Daddy's millions away at the
Ambassador on some stupid musical.

21:26.098 --> 21:28.328
<i>Pile on the Piffle.
- Pepper.</i>

21:29.301 --> 21:31.292
Pepper?
- I'm told.

21:41.213 --> 21:44.910
Since when did girls together
smoke cigars? Hmm? Answer me that.

22:03.569 --> 22:05.901
If I want to smoke cigars,
I'll damned well smoke cigars,

22:05.971 --> 22:08.166
thank you very much.
And to hell with your opinion.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.174
What, they're yours?

22:11.877 --> 22:13.572
You betcha, baby.

22:15.714 --> 22:16.806
Oh!

22:17.116 --> 22:18.481
And you thought
that I...

22:18.550 --> 22:20.245
What?
- Nick...

22:20.319 --> 22:23.152
You, of all people?
How could you?

22:23.222 --> 22:25.588
I'm wounded,
Nicholas, I am wounded.

22:26.191 --> 22:28.056
Darling, sweetheart.

22:28.494 --> 22:31.122
Please forgive me.
It's been a long night. I'm...

22:31.196 --> 22:32.857
No.
- I'm sorry.

22:33.832 --> 22:35.993
No. It's...
It's no good.

22:41.674 --> 22:42.971
All right,
I forgive you!

22:43.042 --> 22:44.441
Fashion show.

22:44.510 --> 22:45.568
Come again?

22:45.644 --> 22:47.168
Fashion show.

22:47.246 --> 22:49.612
Fashion...
Fashion show is right.

22:49.682 --> 22:52.708
And that will be your punishment, man
of little faith. You will have to wait.

22:52.785 --> 22:56.312
What? So I'm being thrown out
of my own flat, am I?

22:56.388 --> 22:58.117
I'm sorry, darling.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.789
Very well.

23:05.330 --> 23:07.560
Tonight then.
At the club.

23:09.034 --> 23:10.331
Miss Pettigrew.

23:10.402 --> 23:11.767
Good day.

23:12.337 --> 23:14.134
Tonight is booked.

23:27.152 --> 23:29.086
You were magnificent!

23:29.988 --> 23:31.285
Are you all right?

23:31.356 --> 23:34.689
I have never sworn
before in my life.

23:35.327 --> 23:37.625
Not even in my mind.

23:37.696 --> 23:40.130
Well, I didn't hear you swear.
- Yes, I did.

23:40.199 --> 23:42.827
I said damned and hell.
And I meant them.

23:42.901 --> 23:44.334
Oh, that's not swearing.

23:44.403 --> 23:47.065
They came out of the
sinful category an age ago.

23:47.139 --> 23:49.903
Desperation.
That's what it's come to.

23:49.975 --> 23:52.944
A little desperation and life can
make of us whatever it chooses.

23:53.011 --> 23:58.916
In my case, a smoking, swearing accomplice
to misdeeds in a den of iniquity.

23:58.984 --> 24:00.815
No! Really?

24:04.156 --> 24:05.623
Oh, you mean here.

24:06.892 --> 24:09.360
But I was the desperate one.
I'm always desperate.

24:09.428 --> 24:11.794
Think of what would have
happened if you hadn't been here.

24:11.864 --> 24:14.958
I shudder to think what
goes on when I'm not here.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.796
Morals are very important
to me, Miss Lafosse.

24:16.869 --> 24:19.429
I am the daughter
of a clergyman.

24:19.505 --> 24:20.802
Poor you.

24:20.873 --> 24:24.172
No. It was a perfectly
good upbringing, thank you.

24:24.243 --> 24:27.804
But I am beginning to think
perhaps a little sheltered.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.314
But it's not
always like this.

24:31.183 --> 24:33.583
Occasionally
it's not like this.

24:36.688 --> 24:38.679
All right, it's always like
this. Is that so very awful?

24:38.757 --> 24:39.849
Please don't go.
You just can't go.

24:39.925 --> 24:43.156
This is the most important
day in my whole life.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.189
I'll phone up that Holt lady right
now and I'll double your salary.

24:46.265 --> 24:48.358
Oh, no, no, no! Thank you.
That won't be necessary.

24:52.070 --> 24:55.335
I don't even know
what a social secretary does.

24:55.407 --> 24:57.398
I only got one because

24:57.776 --> 25:02.475
<i>Charlotte " Rabbit" Warren's got one,
so I figured I'd better get one, too.</i>

25:02.548 --> 25:04.778
Now that I see you in
action, you're just amazing.

25:04.850 --> 25:07.944
Am I? That's very
kind of you to say so.

25:08.020 --> 25:13.117
Phil, gone. Nick, gone. And that
cigar. But that was fast thinking.

25:13.192 --> 25:15.456
I'm only happy to have
been of assistance.

25:15.527 --> 25:17.358
Miss Pettigrew,

25:17.429 --> 25:18.919
I love you.

25:28.907 --> 25:30.568
Well, come on!

25:42.588 --> 25:44.715
Why don't you slip
something else on, Guinevere?

25:44.790 --> 25:47.384
I mean, nobody died,
did they?

25:48.060 --> 25:51.291
Or did Carole make you wear that
sackcloth and ashes for contrast?

25:51.363 --> 25:53.729
Make herself look
even more amazing.

25:53.799 --> 25:55.061
Carole?

25:55.734 --> 25:57.964
That's not a game I play,
Guinevere, I can assure you.

25:58.036 --> 26:00.368
So, let's lose the
blackout curtain, shall we?

26:00.439 --> 26:03.431
These clothes appear to be
the only ones I possess.

26:03.508 --> 26:05.032
You're kidding.

26:06.945 --> 26:08.276
Shoes?

26:08.981 --> 26:10.107
I'm afraid not.

26:10.182 --> 26:12.776
Oh. So, let's go buy some!

26:12.851 --> 26:14.876
I'm not in a position to.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.420
Out of cash?

26:17.489 --> 26:19.184
None at all?
- None at all.

26:19.258 --> 26:22.455
Wow. You social secretaries
sure can spend.

26:23.829 --> 26:26.354
Roulette, was it? Blackjack?
- Certainly not.

26:26.431 --> 26:28.422
Well. Whatever,
it's on me.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.968
No, no, no, I couldn't possibly...
- You sure could possibly.

26:31.036 --> 26:33.561
I, for one, am not running around
town with Oliver Twist's mom.

26:33.639 --> 26:36.472
After the lingerie show,
we go shopping.

27:06.004 --> 27:07.835
It's so frightening.

27:08.974 --> 27:13.206
Yeah. Cap sleeves.
It's a horror show.

27:14.513 --> 27:17.846
It's a nice color, though.
- Yes, very nice color.

27:20.419 --> 27:22.080
Are you cold?

27:22.154 --> 27:24.782
Well, perhaps a little.
- Here.

27:25.958 --> 27:28.586
Oh, no, I couldn't.
- No, you must.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.527
It's a little thank-you
for this morning.

27:33.999 --> 27:36.092
It's beautiful.

28:04.696 --> 28:07.563
Guinevere! Don't
dawdle, we're late!

28:12.004 --> 28:13.995
Today is the day that
Phil announces to the world

28:14.072 --> 28:16.063
<i>who's going to play the lead
in Pile on the Pepper.</i>

28:16.141 --> 28:17.972
And with the lingerie
that I'm about to pick up,

28:18.043 --> 28:19.237
it's no contest, honey.

28:19.311 --> 28:21.302
<i>" Delysia Lafosse
tops the bill!"</i>

28:21.380 --> 28:23.974
How exciting! Is it
to be a West End show?

28:24.049 --> 28:27.849
It is to be a West End smash, Guinevere,
and it's going to make me a star.

28:27.919 --> 28:29.386
I thought
you were a singer.

28:29.454 --> 28:32.480
Well, I've got a voice. But that's
not how you become famous. No.

28:32.557 --> 28:35.025
First stop, West End.
Next stop, Hollywood.

28:35.093 --> 28:36.560
Have you done much
of that sort of thing?

28:36.628 --> 28:38.095
<i>Didn't you catch
Every Day's a Holiday?</i>

28:38.163 --> 28:40.427
One of mine.
- Mae West!

28:41.266 --> 28:42.586
Oh, you did see it?

28:42.587 --> 28:44.531
Oh, yes! Which part were you?

28:45.270 --> 28:47.101
I was in the restaurant scene.

28:47.172 --> 28:49.265
In the back.
- Really?

28:49.341 --> 28:51.275
Behind the palm tree
drinking a margarita.

28:51.343 --> 28:51.509
I...

28:51.510 --> 28:53.334
I think they cut that
for the European print.

28:53.412 --> 28:55.573
<i>A little de trop for you
English, if you know what I mean?</i>

28:55.647 --> 28:57.137
<i>Of course. Of course
there's Four's a Crowd,</i>

28:57.215 --> 29:00.378
with Errol Flynn and...
- Olivia de Havilland!

29:00.452 --> 29:01.527
<i>Seen that as well?</i>

29:01.528 --> 29:03.421
Four's a Crowd is
a wonderful picture.

29:03.488 --> 29:04.682
Who were you?
- The crowd.

29:04.756 --> 29:06.815
Here we are.
Quick, quick.

29:35.353 --> 29:38.015
Guinevere. Come on.
Don't be shy.

29:44.963 --> 29:46.294
She's naked!

29:46.364 --> 29:50.926
Well, hardly. There's so much whalebone on
her, I'm looking for a tail and flippers.

29:51.002 --> 29:52.993
<i>This season's must-have
for the fuller figure,</i>

29:53.071 --> 29:57.337
<i>the Slimlastic corset and uplift
brassiere. A most effective reducer.</i>

29:57.409 --> 30:01.072
If you don't mind a collapsed lung.
- I recognize her.

30:01.146 --> 30:04.343
Edythe? She owns the
best salon in London.

30:04.416 --> 30:06.976
All the latest fashion.
All the latest gossip.

30:07.052 --> 30:09.520
<i>Another slenderizer from
Aphrodite, for the winter season,</i>

30:09.588 --> 30:12.455
<i>is this unique wrap-around
corset with side panels</i>

30:12.524 --> 30:14.754
<i>and front-to-back gussets,
in fleece-lined rubber,</i>

30:14.826 --> 30:17.021
<i>with rustproof steel
spirals throughout.</i>

30:17.095 --> 30:20.758
Rustproof steel. You guys
really are preparing for war.

30:23.535 --> 30:24.900
Guinevere?

30:25.937 --> 30:27.871
A man. In the room.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.636
Oh. Oh,
that's just Joe.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.507
He designs underwear.

30:33.578 --> 30:35.739
And not these walking
air-raid shelters.

30:35.814 --> 30:37.543
Beautiful things.

30:37.616 --> 30:41.950
There are very few men who really
appreciate the female figure like Joe.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.214
It doesn't matter
what you're wearing,

30:43.288 --> 30:46.416
he can see right through to
the real woman underneath.

30:46.491 --> 30:47.651
Oh.

30:48.593 --> 30:49.924
Oh, this is
his collection.

30:49.995 --> 30:53.829
<i>And new this season from Mimi,
designed by Joe Blomfield.</i>

30:58.303 --> 30:59.327
He's dating Edythe.

30:59.404 --> 31:02.237
Tempestuous is the word
that the magazines use.

31:02.908 --> 31:06.674
I mean, of course she's a
darling, but a little difficult.

31:06.745 --> 31:09.737
<i>As you can see, it's going to
be a chilly winter for Mimi fans.</i>

31:09.814 --> 31:12.214
<i>And in that ever-practical
100% silk,</i>

31:12.284 --> 31:15.185
<i>you're going to have to employ
another maid to do the washing, ladies.</i>

31:15.253 --> 31:16.948
<i>That's if you can afford one
after you've paid</i>

31:17.022 --> 31:19.718
<i>through the nose
for one of these frou-frou.</i>

31:19.791 --> 31:21.349
Oh, dear.

31:21.426 --> 31:22.859
I guess they had
another bust-up.

31:22.928 --> 31:24.259
<i>And you'd better
start your diet now</i>

31:24.329 --> 31:26.422
<i>because there's no hiding
your indulgences, ladies.</i>

31:26.498 --> 31:29.490
<i>Not a support in sight
to help human nature.</i>

31:39.778 --> 31:41.507
Excuse me a moment?

31:42.948 --> 31:44.643
<i>Thank you, ladies.</i>

31:49.955 --> 31:52.219
Joe.
- Margery!

31:52.290 --> 31:56.192
So, what can you do to prop
up this ancient monument?

31:57.395 --> 31:58.885
If you must talk
of ancient monuments,

31:58.964 --> 32:01.762
did you know that the Elgin
Marbles were once painted?

32:01.833 --> 32:04.996
No, I can't say that I did.
Bright, garish colors. Awful.

32:05.070 --> 32:08.062
Now aren't they
better just marble,

32:08.139 --> 32:12.041
worn a little into something
wise, as well as beautiful?

32:12.110 --> 32:15.307
Joe Blomfield, you are
the world's best flatterer.

32:15.380 --> 32:18.281
Or maybe I'm saying
you belong in a museum.

32:21.953 --> 32:25.047
You don't tamper with
a masterpiece, Margery.

32:25.624 --> 32:27.251
You allow it to be.

32:27.325 --> 32:29.293
That's my advice to you.

32:38.136 --> 32:41.799
That scarf, if I may say,
looks perfect on you.

32:42.674 --> 32:45.165
Well, thank you.
It was a present.

32:46.511 --> 32:50.777
You know, I think it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever worn.

32:50.849 --> 32:53.511
Now the flatterer
has been out-flattered.

32:53.585 --> 32:55.576
Sorry?
- It's one of mine.

32:55.954 --> 32:58.855
The design.
Last year for Mimi Couture.

32:59.524 --> 33:00.923
My goodness.

33:02.794 --> 33:04.694
You really didn't know.

33:05.263 --> 33:09.324
Well, that is a compliment
indeed, madam. Thank you.

33:10.035 --> 33:11.434
Joe Blomfield.

33:11.503 --> 33:13.937
Guinevere Pettigrew.
- A pleasure.

33:18.543 --> 33:20.010
Not to worry.

33:44.703 --> 33:46.136
Well, I didn't
answer the telephone

33:46.204 --> 33:47.728
because I couldn't
answer the telephone.

33:47.806 --> 33:49.740
Why not?
- I was in the bathroom.

33:49.808 --> 33:50.390
Having a bath?

33:50.391 --> 33:51.969
No, I just didn't
answer the telephone,

33:52.043 --> 33:53.476
and now Joe says
the engagement's off.

33:53.545 --> 33:56.878
Just because of one stupid
little misunderstanding.

33:58.917 --> 34:02.148
Edythe, Miss Pettigrew.
Edythe Dubarry.

34:02.220 --> 34:05.145
Miss Pettigrew is my
new social secretary.

34:05.146 --> 34:05.553
Really?

34:06.057 --> 34:07.615
How intriguing.

34:07.692 --> 34:10.183
I know. Lost her shirt
playing poker or something.

34:10.261 --> 34:13.458
But she is the best in London.
Miss Holt told me so herself.

34:13.531 --> 34:16.364
<i>Just freed up after Carole Lombard
finished Vigil in the Night.</i>

34:16.434 --> 34:17.492
Isn't that right,
Guinevere?

34:17.569 --> 34:20.402
I heard it's
a very fine picture.

34:20.472 --> 34:21.962
Haven't we met before?

34:22.540 --> 34:23.666
I don't believe so.

34:24.242 --> 34:26.574
Recently.
I never forget a face.

34:27.344 --> 34:28.835
You really shouldn't wear
those muddy browns, you know.

34:28.913 --> 34:30.904
They're not your color.
- Oh.

34:31.349 --> 34:34.318
The funeral parlor thing?
It's in hand.

34:34.386 --> 34:37.549
We're on our way to your little store to
correct the situation this very minute.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.453
My shop and salon are at
your disposal, my dear.

34:39.524 --> 34:40.616
Oh!

34:40.692 --> 34:41.716
Come with us!

34:41.793 --> 34:43.693
We can do Guinevere, and
you can tell me all about Joe

34:43.762 --> 34:46.754
and I can tell you about
my amazing morning.

34:48.967 --> 34:51.958
Hang it all, the bone structure's
there. Why the devil not?

34:52.036 --> 34:55.904
Beatrice, cancel my appointments.
I'm suddenly inconvenienced.

34:55.974 --> 34:58.442
Perfect!
Come on, now!

34:58.910 --> 35:02.368
What is she going to do?
- We're going to do a fixie!

35:05.016 --> 35:06.361
Turned Nick
out of his own flat?

35:06.362 --> 35:07.280
She didn't like him.

35:07.352 --> 35:10.515
Good heavens! He let her?
- He was no match for her.

35:10.588 --> 35:12.783
My dear, the woman can
do anything. Anything.

35:12.857 --> 35:16.725
No. Definitely not. It's too pink,
it's too passé. Not that one, either.

35:16.795 --> 35:19.127
And she's coming to the party?
- Well, of course.

35:19.197 --> 35:21.722
<i>She's going to clinch the lead
in Pile on the Pepper for me.</i>

35:21.800 --> 35:24.234
Oh, no, not the red. Not
with her hair, I think.

35:24.302 --> 35:26.736
But I thought you'd secured
that deal last night.

35:26.805 --> 35:28.170
Well, I thought so, too.

35:28.239 --> 35:31.675
And I played it magnificently,
if I do say so myself.

35:33.178 --> 35:35.646
But then Phil announced that he was
going to have lunch with the Rabbit.

35:35.713 --> 35:36.839
Charlotte Warren?
- Mmm.

35:36.915 --> 35:38.405
Oh, my dear.
- Exactly.

35:38.483 --> 35:41.247
So you can see why I
need Guinevere's powers.

35:41.319 --> 35:42.718
I do indeed.

35:43.822 --> 35:45.187
I wonder...

35:46.024 --> 35:47.082
Yes?

35:48.693 --> 35:50.092
Oh, nothing.

35:51.796 --> 35:52.785
That one!
- That one!

35:58.470 --> 35:59.960
Miss Lafosse? Oh!

36:02.240 --> 36:03.400
Oh!

36:05.376 --> 36:06.968
Thank you. Very nice.

36:23.495 --> 36:26.020
Guinevere,
I think we're ready.

36:33.705 --> 36:35.570
And you're sure that's all
it was, Edythe, my dear?

36:35.640 --> 36:37.938
Just a late train?
No Gerry involved?

36:38.009 --> 36:39.499
You're as bad as Joe.

36:39.577 --> 36:42.705
Gerry and I are finished.
Absolutely finished.

36:46.050 --> 36:49.383
So Tabitha and I bumped into him
at Hat Day at the races. What of it?

36:49.454 --> 36:52.321
We got the last train in to Victoria
and that was absolutely that.

36:52.390 --> 36:55.382
My fruit fedora was much
admired, thank you for asking.

36:55.460 --> 36:58.190
Joe can check with the station
if he's so damnably suspicious.

36:58.263 --> 37:01.596
Arrived at 11:30 and took
a taxi straight home. Alone.

37:01.666 --> 37:02.758
The whole thing
is ridiculous.

37:02.834 --> 37:05.564
One late train and the
whole marriage is off.

37:05.637 --> 37:08.538
Men are so untrusting.
I can't think why.

37:11.543 --> 37:13.135
Are you all right?

37:15.513 --> 37:18.380
Sorry, I was just
remembering something.

37:21.586 --> 37:23.281
Everything all right,
Guinevere?

37:23.354 --> 37:25.788
Oh, yes. Just a moment.

37:35.867 --> 37:37.232
This is me?

37:37.802 --> 37:39.292
All you.

37:39.370 --> 37:41.099
As nature intended.

37:43.908 --> 37:46.240
Guinevere, control
yourself, for heaven's sake!

37:46.311 --> 37:47.301
The mascara!

37:47.302 --> 37:49.280
No, of course.
Of course.

37:49.614 --> 37:50.945
That was close.

37:51.015 --> 37:53.483
Well, I'm just gonna put this, and a
few other things, on Nick's account.

37:53.551 --> 37:55.348
I'll be right back.

37:59.557 --> 38:03.152
Well, what
a transformation.

38:03.995 --> 38:07.260
I suppose I've never felt
I really deserved it.

38:08.466 --> 38:10.991
A social secretary
such as yourself?

38:11.069 --> 38:14.163
Carole Lombard's social
secretary, no less.

38:15.273 --> 38:16.535
Eyeliner.

38:26.751 --> 38:29.413
As you're such
a wow with the men,

38:29.487 --> 38:32.581
I was wondering whether you
could have a word with Joe for me.

38:32.657 --> 38:35.524
Smooth this little
misunderstanding over.

38:36.427 --> 38:39.555
We're getting married,
you know. Were.

38:39.631 --> 38:41.724
It would mean
such a lot to me.

38:41.799 --> 38:44.029
I'm afraid
I couldn't do that.

38:45.069 --> 38:46.263
Really?

38:48.006 --> 38:52.534
You and I, Guinevere, we don't have
what the Delysias of this world have.

38:53.945 --> 38:55.776
We have to work at it,
improvise a touch,

38:55.847 --> 38:57.280
act a little to get
what we want.

38:57.348 --> 38:59.714
You know what I mean,
don't you?

39:00.385 --> 39:01.511
There.

39:01.586 --> 39:03.019
I'm sure Delysia
wouldn't mind.

39:03.087 --> 39:05.988
Well, that should put a
few more gray hairs on Nick's head.

39:06.057 --> 39:08.582
My, you do look ravishing.
- Wonderful news!

39:08.660 --> 39:12.221
Guinevere has very kindly offered
to sort things out with Joe for me.

39:12.296 --> 39:15.823
But that's a marvelous idea. If anybody
can make Joe see sense, Guinevere can.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.595
Isn't that right?

39:17.669 --> 39:19.364
Okay. Come on.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.614
Listen.

39:37.889 --> 39:38.981
Nick?

39:40.224 --> 39:42.021
Fingers like bananas.

39:42.427 --> 39:43.519
Philip?

39:44.629 --> 39:46.893
Oh, yes.
Charlotte Warren.

39:46.964 --> 39:48.295
Permit me.

39:56.774 --> 39:58.605
Thief. Burglar.

39:59.110 --> 40:01.806
I've had some reactions to my
playing, but never quite that.

40:01.879 --> 40:04.109
I saw you at the jail.
I saw you.

40:05.049 --> 40:06.880
Oh, it's you!

40:07.218 --> 40:09.482
I say, I'm awfully
sorry about that.

40:09.554 --> 40:10.851
Michael!

40:12.490 --> 40:16.153
It's so good to see you.
However did you get in?

40:16.227 --> 40:17.956
One picks up a few tricks
in prison, you know?

40:18.029 --> 40:21.089
Breaking and entering
being one of them.

40:21.165 --> 40:22.189
So.

40:23.167 --> 40:25.567
What have you got
to say for yourself?

40:25.636 --> 40:26.660
Oh, well...

40:26.738 --> 40:29.434
I think I must have gotten the
days mixed up. Or was it the place?

40:29.507 --> 40:31.441
I'm awfully sorry, Michael.

40:31.509 --> 40:33.534
Can you ever forgive me?

40:37.014 --> 40:38.504
Now what do you say?

40:38.583 --> 40:42.781
Part of me says if you do that again,
I'll heave you through the goddamn window.

40:42.854 --> 40:45.379
And another part
of me says that

40:46.057 --> 40:49.322
I deserve it. Every bit.

40:49.393 --> 40:53.124
Oh, no. Don't play that game
with me. Not this time, Delysia.

40:53.197 --> 40:54.824
What do you mean?

40:54.899 --> 40:57.732
You've made a fool out
of me for the last time.

40:57.835 --> 41:00.099
Oh, don't say that, Michael.

41:00.171 --> 41:02.162
You can do anything
you like to me. Anything.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.438
Shake me again... No, better not
stand too close to the window.

41:06.511 --> 41:08.035
Or maybe,

41:09.547 --> 41:11.208
maybe kiss me?

41:19.991 --> 41:21.481
Not a chance.

41:22.059 --> 41:23.924
Why, you...
- I'm crazy about you.

41:23.995 --> 41:26.725
You know that. But even I've
got my limit and I've reached it.

41:26.798 --> 41:29.096
No more games,
no more lies.

41:29.167 --> 41:33.160
No more Phil, no more Nick.
It's me, just me, or that's it.

41:33.971 --> 41:35.063
I'll never
see you again.

41:35.139 --> 41:36.766
You wouldn't.

41:36.841 --> 41:38.968
<i>See this? The Queen Mary.</i>

41:39.043 --> 41:41.238
Two tickets. Sails for
New York tomorrow morning.

41:41.312 --> 41:45.874
I'm playing the Upper Deck Cocktail
Bar, with an as-yet-unannounced singer.

41:46.517 --> 41:48.485
Now tell me I wouldn't.

41:49.854 --> 41:50.912
But what about
the cabaret?

41:50.988 --> 41:54.082
You and me together,
we're the best in London.

41:54.959 --> 41:56.824
So we'll be the best
in New York.

42:04.502 --> 42:05.696
Or not.

42:10.074 --> 42:12.042
Isn't there a decent drink
in this hellhole?

42:12.109 --> 42:14.100
Yes. What would you like?

42:15.046 --> 42:16.604
It's me who should
be offering you a drink.

42:16.681 --> 42:20.811
After our unfortunate meeting
yesterday, I am definitely in your debt.

42:20.885 --> 42:22.785
How do you take
your whiskey?

42:22.854 --> 42:25.220
He does seem to be a little
agitated about something.

42:25.289 --> 42:26.483
Yes.

42:27.225 --> 42:29.716
Well, I'm afraid that might be my fault.
- Indeed?

42:29.794 --> 42:32.024
Ice pick?
- It's in the drawer.

42:32.129 --> 42:34.563
Somewhere.
Ice in the Fridgidaire?

42:34.632 --> 42:36.259
I want the pick
for murder, not ice.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.335
See? He's such
a hothead.

42:39.403 --> 42:40.836
He takes love
so seriously.

42:40.905 --> 42:42.270
Is that a problem?

42:42.340 --> 42:44.331
Of course
it's a problem!

42:44.408 --> 42:46.000
Michael Pardew.

42:47.211 --> 42:49.771
Pettigrew.
Guinevere Pettigrew.

42:49.847 --> 42:52.077
About time we had
a formal introduction.

42:52.149 --> 42:53.173
It's certainly a problem

42:53.251 --> 42:55.742
when the girl doesn't
pitch up for the proposal.

42:55.820 --> 42:56.551
Oh, Michael.

42:56.552 --> 42:58.380
Not a word from you.
Thank you.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.549
What do think of this?
Private boat on the Thames,

43:00.625 --> 43:02.149
last of the
season's strawberries,

43:02.226 --> 43:04.319
Dom Pérignon champagne.
Everything.

43:04.395 --> 43:07.262
Strawberries.
And you didn't appear?

43:07.331 --> 43:08.958
I was scared.

43:09.033 --> 43:10.500
You were scared?

43:10.568 --> 43:12.900
How do you think a pianist without
two shillings to rub together

43:12.970 --> 43:16.736
feels proposing to the most
beautiful woman in the world?

43:16.807 --> 43:18.206
Dare I ask
what happened?

43:18.276 --> 43:20.574
Well, after an hour and a half
bobbing around on my own,

43:20.645 --> 43:22.636
I opened the champagne.

43:22.713 --> 43:25.978
One glass didn't seem enough.
One thing led to another.

43:26.050 --> 43:27.813
Then I had a bit
of a brainwave,

43:27.885 --> 43:29.764
as we floated pastthe
Tower of London.

43:29.765 --> 43:30.149
Oh, dear.

43:30.221 --> 43:33.122
Decided the ring I had
wasn't good enough for her.

43:33.190 --> 43:34.714
Well, when a fellow
needs a diamond,

43:34.792 --> 43:38.284
what better place to get one
than the Tower of London?

43:38.729 --> 43:41.163
The rest is all
a bit hazy, but

43:41.232 --> 43:43.996
there appears to have been an
altercation with the yeoman of the guard.

43:44.068 --> 43:45.797
You didn't.

43:46.804 --> 43:48.965
Thirty days
bread and water.

43:51.809 --> 43:53.572
But you know what?

43:53.644 --> 43:56.078
Prison certainly
clears the head.

43:56.480 --> 43:59.210
Pure and simple,
I want you to marry me.

44:00.551 --> 44:03.486
And it's a one-word
conversation, Delysia.

44:08.392 --> 44:12.852
Don't you think that on
such a momentous occasion

44:12.930 --> 44:14.420
a little time
should be allowed?

44:14.498 --> 44:16.261
Oh, stalling tactic.

44:17.468 --> 44:19.285
Is it because I'm not
rich enough for her?

44:19.286 --> 44:19.834
Certainly not.

44:19.904 --> 44:23.135
Well, it's true. I'm wearing
most of my worldly possessions.

44:23.207 --> 44:26.134
I could never offer
this kind of blackmail.

44:26.135 --> 44:26.267
Oh.

44:26.344 --> 44:28.505
And who pays you
for playing the piano, huh?

44:28.579 --> 44:30.706
You telling me you give Nick
his money back after every show?

44:30.781 --> 44:34.114
No! And every damned shilling
I take hurts me to the bone.

44:34.185 --> 44:37.211
Which is why it's got
to change, Delysia.

44:37.288 --> 44:40.780
Money or love? That's the
question I'm asking, D.

44:41.625 --> 44:46.187
With you singing and me playing,
we could knock the world flat.

44:49.333 --> 44:51.062
Yes or no, Delysia?

44:52.903 --> 44:56.771
You are a most uncommonly
persuasive man, Mr. Pardew.

44:59.577 --> 45:01.340
But surely a lady
should have a moment or two

45:01.412 --> 45:03.937
to consider the most
important decision of her life?

45:04.015 --> 45:05.642
A moment?
She's had a whole year.

45:05.716 --> 45:06.944
You did say you
were in my debt.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.545
Damn it, I did, too.
Fair enough.

45:13.724 --> 45:15.589
Okay, here's the deal.

45:15.926 --> 45:18.588
I'll play for you today,
Delysia,

45:18.662 --> 45:21.859
and for the rest of your
life, if you'll marry me.

45:22.733 --> 45:24.724
Never again
if you don't.

45:29.407 --> 45:31.898
See you later, Miss Pettigrew.
- Later?

45:31.976 --> 45:34.342
In my professional
capacity.

45:38.282 --> 45:39.749
As for you,

45:40.284 --> 45:41.808
it's now or never.

45:41.886 --> 45:44.218
The ship sails
tomorrow morning.

45:47.024 --> 45:48.321
He is...

45:49.293 --> 45:51.318
Impossible.
- Magnificent.

45:53.998 --> 45:55.761
So you marry him.

46:06.110 --> 46:07.509
Guinevere?
- Mmm-hmm?

46:08.279 --> 46:11.806
Tell me the honest truth.
It's a darned fix, isn't it?

46:12.950 --> 46:16.579
Nothing that can't be unfixed
with some good common sense.

46:17.188 --> 46:19.053
But take a look
at the headlines.

46:19.123 --> 46:22.991
With Nick, I get this magnificent
flat and my job at the Peacock.

46:23.594 --> 46:24.856
And with Phil,

46:24.929 --> 46:28.660
I get the best part on the West End
stage and my chance to be a star.

46:28.732 --> 46:30.427
And with Michael?

46:31.669 --> 46:33.296
With Michael...

46:34.405 --> 46:36.566
I get the best friend
I ever had.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.574
Is that all Michael is?

46:38.909 --> 46:40.206
Well,

46:43.414 --> 46:45.541
he's rather passionate, too.

46:52.823 --> 46:54.984
I know what
you're thinking.

46:55.693 --> 46:57.524
Michael's the one.

47:02.633 --> 47:04.396
But what about
everything else?

47:04.468 --> 47:06.265
And who says I'm looking
for a darned husband

47:06.337 --> 47:07.770
this very minute, anyway?

47:09.106 --> 47:12.371
Not everything comes along
just when we want it.

47:14.578 --> 47:17.308
There are times when
choices just have to be made,

47:17.381 --> 47:19.747
or you certainly
will miss out.

47:20.084 --> 47:21.346
No.

47:21.752 --> 47:24.243
No, I won't accept that.
I won't.

47:24.321 --> 47:28.451
<i>This " all of you or none of
you" stuff that Michael's pulling.</i>

47:29.560 --> 47:31.187
It's too much.

47:31.262 --> 47:33.321
But he is in love
with you, Delysia.

47:33.397 --> 47:35.888
Can you say that
about anyone else?

47:37.768 --> 47:39.201
Guinevere,

47:40.538 --> 47:43.803
haven't you ever been torn between
more than one person at the same time?

47:43.874 --> 47:48.004
No, I can't say I've had
that particular problem.

47:51.248 --> 47:53.011
You are beautiful, Delysia.

47:54.818 --> 47:58.413
Well, it's not a bad figure,
if I do say so myself.

48:02.193 --> 48:05.128
Have you ever been
in love at all, Guinevere?

48:06.530 --> 48:08.464
Once.
- And was it this

48:08.933 --> 48:10.992
<i>" all of you
or none of you" stuff?</i>

48:11.068 --> 48:12.296
Oh, yes.

48:12.369 --> 48:14.269
From him or from you?

48:15.072 --> 48:16.096
Both.

48:16.173 --> 48:18.403
Really? Do tell.

48:19.877 --> 48:21.037
No.

48:21.579 --> 48:23.513
All a long time ago.

48:23.581 --> 48:26.414
You'll catch your death.
Put this on.

48:33.257 --> 48:34.690
Allow me.

48:39.396 --> 48:41.057
Excuse me, madam.

48:43.467 --> 48:44.991
Excuse me.

48:47.771 --> 48:49.136
Excuse me?

48:49.940 --> 48:52.135
Take that through
to the kitchen, please.

48:52.209 --> 48:55.303
And you do the same as well.
And tell John to pull the rug up.

48:55.379 --> 48:57.609
Party about to start
soon, so chop-chop.

48:57.681 --> 48:59.774
Party? There's a party?

49:01.151 --> 49:02.743
Miss Lafosse?
- Hmm?

49:02.820 --> 49:05.812
There's a troop of people downstairs who
appear to be under the misapprehension

49:05.889 --> 49:07.550
there is to be
a party here.

49:07.625 --> 49:08.853
Yes.

49:08.926 --> 49:10.086
Today?

49:10.761 --> 49:12.820
Yes. Didn't I say?
- No.

49:12.930 --> 49:13.919
Oh.

49:14.398 --> 49:15.729
Silly me.

49:16.734 --> 49:18.827
Will there be many people?

49:18.902 --> 49:20.836
I should say so,
Guinevere.

49:20.904 --> 49:21.996
It's the big one.

49:22.072 --> 49:23.903
<i>The big one?
- Pile on the Pepper.</i>

49:23.974 --> 49:26.238
Phil's going to make
the announcement.

49:26.310 --> 49:27.470
What do you think?

49:27.544 --> 49:29.603
Do I get the part? Hmm?

49:30.214 --> 49:31.476
Oh, yes.

49:51.669 --> 49:55.036
My dear, you look as if you've never
been to a cocktail party in your life.

49:55.105 --> 49:56.766
Why, thank you,
but I don't drink.

49:56.840 --> 49:59.536
Oh, it's not a drink,
really. It's a cocktail.

49:59.610 --> 50:01.373
Good luck, darlings.

50:01.879 --> 50:04.177
Joe's the old one
over there.

50:07.718 --> 50:09.413
Work your magic.

50:23.767 --> 50:25.701
Of all the nerve.

50:25.769 --> 50:28.863
Well. Time to make
the Rabbit run.

50:28.939 --> 50:30.497
Are you sure
that's wise?

50:30.574 --> 50:31.666
Mmm.

50:32.810 --> 50:34.209
Phil, darling.

50:34.278 --> 50:37.475
Delysia, sweetheart.
Lovely to see you.

50:37.548 --> 50:40.016
This is Charlotte Warren.

50:41.552 --> 50:43.520
Do you know
each other?

50:43.587 --> 50:44.918
A pleasure.

50:44.988 --> 50:46.785
How nice
to see you again.

50:46.857 --> 50:50.293
Phil and I had such a lovely lunch
together today, didn't we, darling?

50:50.361 --> 50:53.125
Well, I thought he'd have a
big appetite, after last night.

50:53.197 --> 50:55.222
May I suggest retiring
to a safe distance?

50:55.299 --> 50:57.130
I think you're
absolutely right.

50:57.201 --> 50:58.668
Tin hat on.

51:02.639 --> 51:04.129
I'm sorry,
it's Phil Goldman.

51:04.208 --> 51:05.766
How do you do?
- We've met before, actually.

51:05.843 --> 51:08.038
You were entirely
naked at the time.

51:08.679 --> 51:10.112
Guinevere?

51:10.180 --> 51:12.205
Is that you?
My goodness!

51:12.516 --> 51:13.608
You look marvelous.

51:13.684 --> 51:17.017
Charlotte, I just wanted to let
you know there are no hard feelings.

51:17.087 --> 51:19.282
That is so
gracious of you.

51:19.757 --> 51:22.988
To the victor the spoils, to the
vanquished two comps for Press Night.

51:23.060 --> 51:24.527
And so wise.

51:24.595 --> 51:27.063
I hope I can be
like that one day.

51:27.831 --> 51:30.561
Wisdom requires more than
the passing of years, I fear.

51:30.634 --> 51:34.195
Though a little bird tells me that the
part of the crippled mother is still open.

51:34.271 --> 51:36.705
You'd look ravishing
with a stick.

51:39.877 --> 51:44.780
And I won't forget about those
tickets. Is it two, three, four...

51:44.848 --> 51:48.443
Silly me, I've forgotten how
many boyfriends you've got.

51:51.922 --> 51:53.082
Now, Philip,

51:53.157 --> 51:55.921
<i>how are your deliberations over
Pile on the Pepper proceeding?</i>

51:55.993 --> 51:58.018
Well, between
you and me,

51:58.395 --> 52:00.488
Charlotte has the most
alluring singing voice.

52:00.564 --> 52:04.432
And I have to say, Daddy's quite
keen. In fact, more than keen.

52:04.501 --> 52:07.231
So you're going to give
Miss Warren the part?

52:07.337 --> 52:11.296
Delysia's going to be a bit
off-color about it all, I'm afraid.

52:14.311 --> 52:16.609
Hey ho.
- Just one question.

52:17.414 --> 52:20.975
Does Charlotte have quite the
same attachment to you as Delysia?

52:21.051 --> 52:23.849
No. No, no,
she certainly doesn't.

52:25.322 --> 52:27.552
Do you think that was more
than a passing attraction?

52:27.624 --> 52:30.218
I mean, we both
know actresses, Guinevere.

52:30.294 --> 52:33.195
It did occur to me
that it might be, you know,

52:33.263 --> 52:35.288
purely to secure the part?

52:35.632 --> 52:39.591
I have no doubt that Miss Lafosse
believes that you are one of the most...

52:41.705 --> 52:44.936
Unquestionably, the most
important man in that room.

52:45.008 --> 52:47.408
My dear woman,
do you really think so?

52:47.478 --> 52:48.604
I do.

52:49.213 --> 52:51.875
The scales have fallen
from my doubting eyes.

52:51.949 --> 52:53.814
So pleased to have helped.
- Helped?

52:53.884 --> 52:57.115
You've just made me
the happiest man in the world.

52:58.255 --> 53:00.189
You seem to have made
quite an impression on him.

53:00.257 --> 53:03.192
Oh. Yes.
I do, don't I?

53:04.862 --> 53:06.159
Joe Blomfield.

53:07.664 --> 53:09.325
A great pleasure.

53:09.399 --> 53:12.960
Have we met before? I feel sure
I recognize you from somewhere.

53:13.036 --> 53:14.663
I don't think so,

53:14.738 --> 53:17.673
but I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance.

53:23.914 --> 53:26.474
I have met your fiancée,
I believe.

53:27.217 --> 53:28.445
Edythe? Um...

53:29.720 --> 53:31.483
No longer my fiancée,
I'm afraid.

53:31.555 --> 53:34.922
Really? I'm so sorry.
Not a permanent rift, I hope?

53:35.692 --> 53:38.525
It would be ungentlemanly
of me to go into the details.

53:38.595 --> 53:39.994
Of course.

53:43.734 --> 53:45.827
You know, these things
are amazing, aren't they?

53:45.903 --> 53:47.063
May I?

53:47.404 --> 53:49.463
Why not?
- Excuse me.

53:55.379 --> 53:56.676
Progress?

53:57.014 --> 53:58.572
I'm afraid not.

53:58.916 --> 54:00.144
Nor is there likely to be.

54:00.217 --> 54:02.913
Transformations work
both ways, Guinevere.

54:02.986 --> 54:07.320
It would take me 30 seconds to put
you back in the soup kitchen queue.

54:08.425 --> 54:11.189
I told you,
I never forget a face.

54:11.261 --> 54:12.888
Victoria Station.

54:13.363 --> 54:17.094
Nor have I forgotten with whom
you shared a taxi last night.

54:18.769 --> 54:20.236
Oh, you have.

54:20.304 --> 54:23.330
If you want to continue
working for Delysia, you have.

54:23.407 --> 54:26.865
Now we all of us need things in
our life. I need Joe for his...

54:26.944 --> 54:30.402
Well, he's a man of
connections. And you need...

54:31.815 --> 54:34.978
You need to stay off of
the streets, I imagine.

54:43.860 --> 54:46.852
I see Edythe
has told you all.

54:48.432 --> 54:53.028
If it weren't to commit another
indiscretion, I might disclose Edythe is...

54:55.372 --> 54:58.273
As Miss Lafosse would say,
crazy about you.

54:59.109 --> 55:00.940
To be indiscreet back,

55:01.011 --> 55:05.846
she's rather more crazy about my position
in the fashion world than she is about me.

55:05.916 --> 55:08.680
A woman scorned
is a dangerous thing.

55:08.752 --> 55:11.812
And a bruised heart will often
speak harshly, Mr. Blomfield.

55:11.888 --> 55:15.824
Oh, I sometimes wonder where
Edythe's heart has got to.

55:16.627 --> 55:20.222
A woman with an absent heart
would not shed such tears, I think.

55:20.297 --> 55:21.491
Edythe?

55:22.666 --> 55:24.156
Shed tears?

55:25.702 --> 55:27.226
You people!

55:27.971 --> 55:32.670
With your green drinks and your
parties and your subterfuges.

55:33.377 --> 55:35.675
You're all playing at love.

55:35.746 --> 55:38.579
One minute her, the next minute
someone else. Flit, flit, flit.

55:38.649 --> 55:40.583
Well, I'm not playing.

55:42.019 --> 55:43.748
Love is not a game.

56:04.241 --> 56:05.765
You've worked
your magic again.

56:05.842 --> 56:07.867
I can't do it.
- You've already done it.

56:07.944 --> 56:09.241
Joe just came up
and asked me

56:09.312 --> 56:11.405
if he was being a cad
breaking off the engagement.

56:11.481 --> 56:15.042
I've no idea what you said,
but I believe we've got him.

56:16.186 --> 56:18.051
It must be extraordinary
being you.

56:18.121 --> 56:21.090
Extraordinary? No.
Very, very ordinary.

56:21.158 --> 56:24.252
Delysia, darling, is it
true what Guinevere said?

56:24.327 --> 56:26.454
Well, if Miss P said it,
you can bet your shirt on it.

56:26.530 --> 56:28.930
So I can tell the whole
world about you and me?

56:28.999 --> 56:31.024
Officially an item, what?
Till death us do part?

56:31.101 --> 56:32.363
What?

56:33.937 --> 56:38.499
At the very same time that you
announce your casting decision, sweets.

56:38.575 --> 56:39.564
Oh!

56:39.943 --> 56:42.537
And what better time
than right now?

56:42.612 --> 56:45.206
You're absolutely right,
damn it. This very minute.

56:45.282 --> 56:48.513
Come on, gorgeous, no
time to waste. To horse.

56:53.557 --> 56:56.822
Well, I suppose
that was necessary.

56:58.095 --> 57:01.428
You wanted the part. He'd
already chosen the Rabbit.

57:04.301 --> 57:07.702
No, Delysia,
you mustn't do this.

57:10.507 --> 57:11.906
But I must.

57:20.550 --> 57:22.518
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:25.756 --> 57:27.155
as you might know,

57:27.224 --> 57:30.990
<i>I'm putting on Pile on the Pepper
at the Ambassador, don't you know?</i>

57:31.061 --> 57:32.323
Have I mentioned this?

57:33.930 --> 57:37.889
Anyway, it is my pleasure to
announce that I have, today,

57:37.968 --> 57:40.198
cast the lead
actress, what?

57:42.305 --> 57:45.672
<i>She is not only Hortensia
in Pile on the Pepper,</i>

57:45.742 --> 57:50.338
she is also my Hortensia,
if you know what I mean.

57:51.481 --> 57:53.415
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:53.483 --> 57:56.008
your Hortensia
and my Hortensia,

57:57.220 --> 57:59.051
Delysia Lafosse!

58:18.742 --> 58:19.936
So

58:20.477 --> 58:21.910
let's dance!

58:40.931 --> 58:42.159
Michael?

58:53.476 --> 58:55.376
May I?
- Please.

59:39.256 --> 59:42.020
They don't remember
the last one.

59:44.060 --> 59:45.652
No. They don't.

59:49.799 --> 59:53.291
Delysia's name in lights at the
Ambassador. What do you think of that?

59:54.404 --> 59:56.565
Well, it's certainly what
Delysia's always wanted.

59:59.342 --> 01:00:01.037
Joe, my dear,

01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:04.672
I don't think I could ever forgive
myself if last night's misunderstanding

01:00:04.748 --> 01:00:08.343
got in the way of something
so, so important to us both.

01:00:10.387 --> 01:00:14.118
I was wondering, could you
walk me home and let me explain?

01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:19.925
Of course, my dear.
Of course.

01:00:21.998 --> 01:00:23.522
Nice to have met you.

01:00:25.402 --> 01:00:27.870
Did you see the planes?
Weren't they magnificent?

01:00:43.753 --> 01:00:45.015
Madam?

01:00:45.588 --> 01:00:47.385
Not now, thank you.

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:39.568
Well, what do you know?

01:01:39.642 --> 01:01:42.202
It's my last night
singing at the club.

01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:44.178
I'm going to be a star.

01:01:45.815 --> 01:01:48.648
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me?

01:01:48.718 --> 01:01:50.948
I have done you
a disservice.

01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:54.656
You have done what I asked.
That's your job.

01:01:55.458 --> 01:02:00.225
It may well be my job, but what I have
done is untrue to you and untrue to me.

01:02:00.296 --> 01:02:02.196
You have lost a man who
loves you for who you are,

01:02:02.265 --> 01:02:04.995
not for who
you pretend to be.

01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:09.598
And you, who are you to tell
me what's best for my life?

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.968
I'm nobody. But apparently
an expert on love.

01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:18.939
No.

01:02:20.216 --> 01:02:21.706
I have no one.

01:02:21.785 --> 01:02:23.377
I am not
an expert on love.

01:02:23.453 --> 01:02:25.921
I am an expert on the
lack of love, Delysia.

01:02:25.989 --> 01:02:30.119
And that is a fate from which I
wish most fervently to save you.

01:02:33.163 --> 01:02:34.562
Guinevere.

01:02:35.165 --> 01:02:38.259
No pity, please. I endure
quite well, thank you.

01:02:53.983 --> 01:02:55.219
Where to, ma'am?

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.918
Scarlet Peacock, please.

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:21.510
Do you know what
my name is, Guinevere?

01:03:21.578 --> 01:03:24.911
I was under the impression
it was Delysia Lafosse.

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:27.973
Sarah Grubb.

01:03:29.452 --> 01:03:31.943
One of the Pittsburgh Grubbs.

01:03:32.021 --> 01:03:34.148
My father
is a steelworker.

01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:39.153
No one else in the world
knows that, apart from Michael.

01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:40.787
He doesn't judge me.

01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:42.491
No. He wouldn't.

01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:44.726
But you do.
- Me?

01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:46.360
I certainly do not.

01:03:46.436 --> 01:03:48.996
Oh, you think you don't,
but you do.

01:03:52.442 --> 01:03:55.036
This is all I own,
Guinevere.

01:03:57.147 --> 01:03:59.741
And two dozen pair
of shoes.

01:04:03.019 --> 01:04:05.419
For all the fancy apartments
and fashion shows,

01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:08.457
do you know how close I am
to having nothing?

01:04:10.026 --> 01:04:13.018
Every day I wake up
and I think,

01:04:13.096 --> 01:04:15.428
if I make the wrong move,
I could be out on that street,

01:04:15.498 --> 01:04:18.023
with no clothes,
no food, no job

01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:21.060
and no friends.

01:04:23.006 --> 01:04:25.474
Just plain old
Sarah Grubb again.

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:28.901
Do you know what that's like?

01:04:28.978 --> 01:04:30.343
Yes, I do.

01:04:35.118 --> 01:04:36.346
You do?

01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:39.218
In that at least,
we are alike.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.917
And now my mascara's gonna run.

01:04:44.918 --> 01:04:46.322
That will never do.

01:04:51.868 --> 01:04:53.631
Here we are, ma'am.

01:05:09.352 --> 01:05:10.785
How are you?

01:05:11.354 --> 01:05:12.446
Hey.

01:05:16.025 --> 01:05:17.424
Having fun?

01:05:26.936 --> 01:05:29.302
Sweetheart.
- Nick. Hi.

01:05:29.372 --> 01:05:33.308
Now, I've heard the news, darling.
Congratulations. It's the big time, huh?

01:05:33.743 --> 01:05:34.869
Oh.

01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.673
I thought you'd
be furious.

01:05:36.746 --> 01:05:38.236
Furious, me? Why?

01:05:38.314 --> 01:05:40.839
No. You and me,
we're the same.

01:05:40.917 --> 01:05:45.183
We both get what we want
by bending a bit, don't we?

01:05:46.055 --> 01:05:48.615
I get it, D.
It's business.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.784
No, Nick, I...

01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:54.159
I'll see you back
at mine later.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:06:00.734
How can he just... He treats
me like I'm a common...

01:06:02.005 --> 01:06:03.620
You don't think of
me like that, do you?

01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:04.132
Of course not.

01:06:06.943 --> 01:06:08.433
Delysia!

01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:09.773
Darling!

01:06:13.716 --> 01:06:16.549
Darling, you look perfect, what?
Doesn't she?

01:06:19.822 --> 01:06:21.847
Guinevere, how lovely.

01:06:21.924 --> 01:06:24.791
To you, I owe a special
debt of gratitude.

01:06:25.128 --> 01:06:28.723
Champagne! The only thing as
delightful as my dear Delysia.

01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:32.097
Darling, come on, finish
your glass. There's plenty.

01:06:33.569 --> 01:06:35.161
It's all back on.

01:06:35.238 --> 01:06:37.399
Darling,
that's marvelous.

01:06:37.473 --> 01:06:38.462
Did you hear
the news?

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:40.873
These two lovebirds are
finally tying the knot.

01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:43.275
Congrats, dear fellow.
When's the happy day, what?

01:06:43.346 --> 01:06:46.611
We were going to keep it to ourselves
for the present, but you know the ladies.

01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:47.672
Oh, do I ever.

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.775
Sorry, darling.
Couldn't keep it in.

01:06:49.852 --> 01:06:51.911
It's nice to see
you again, madam.

01:06:51.988 --> 01:06:54.115
May I add my
congratulations?

01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.686
Let's dance!

01:06:54.687 --> 01:06:56.215
If you don't mind,
Edythe, I have a...

01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:57.657
Oh, you drone on, Joey.

01:06:57.727 --> 01:06:59.888
Leonard will take me for
a spin, won't you, Lenny?

01:06:59.962 --> 01:07:01.054
Be delighted, Edy.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.620
Delysia, Phil, come on.

01:07:02.699 --> 01:07:04.030
Of course!

01:07:48.277 --> 01:07:50.268
Well, as we have
no conversation,

01:07:50.346 --> 01:07:53.179
I have no option but to
ask you for the next dance.

01:07:53.249 --> 01:07:56.685
Alas, I can dance
nothing but the waltz.

01:08:19.008 --> 01:08:20.872
Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:08:20.943 --> 01:08:22.774
Well, to take
another woman's escort...

01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:26.337
You didn't take me,
I took you.

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:36.417
I'm sure Edythe can cope.

01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:44.091
What happened to that
particularly beautiful scarf

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:45.930
you were wearing
at the fashion show?

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:47.526
What are you
talking about?

01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:54.133
Despite your most elegant transformation,
the body is still the same.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.837
Mr. Blomfield.

01:08:56.212 --> 01:08:59.010
As are the eyes. Most
fetching, if I may say.

01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:01.379
I'm not really sure
you should say.

01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:04.249
I'm sorry. Professional
habit. A bad one.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:08.886
I have to remember you're
not like these people.

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:11.118
Am I terribly
old-fashioned?

01:09:11.928 --> 01:09:13.486
Indeed you are.

01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:15.889
And all the better for it.

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:20.194
Am I making you
feel uncomfortable?

01:09:21.037 --> 01:09:24.234
This is the most comfortable
I've felt all day.

01:10:01.644 --> 01:10:03.703
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:07.146
welcome to Nick Calderelli's
Scarlet Peacock.

01:10:12.655 --> 01:10:17.388
I'm delighted to introduce you tonight
to a very talented lady friend of mine.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.360
And she can sing, too.

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:23.430
It's my pleasure
to bring you

01:10:23.799 --> 01:10:25.528
Delysia Lafosse!

01:10:37.179 --> 01:10:39.147
<i>You're too kind, really.</i>

01:10:41.317 --> 01:10:43.683
Hello, Michael.
How was prison?

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.847
And to get us
in the mood,

01:10:46.923 --> 01:10:49.357
<i>we'll start with
Hot Shoe Shimmy.</i>

01:10:51.861 --> 01:10:53.556
Change of program.

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:56.559
<i>If I Didn't Care.</i>

01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:09.807
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:11:12.515 --> 01:11:17.452
<i>More than words can say</i>

01:11:19.889 --> 01:11:24.451
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:30.898
<i>Would I feel this way?</i>

01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:36.868
<i>If this isn't love</i>

01:11:39.342 --> 01:11:44.905
<i>Then why do I thrill?</i>

01:11:45.948 --> 01:11:52.114
<i>And what makes my head go
'round and 'round</i>

01:11:52.722 --> 01:11:58.183
<i>While my heart stands still?</i>

01:11:58.794 --> 01:12:02.753
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:09.029
<i>Would it be the same?</i>

01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:18.146
<i>Would my every prayer
begin and end</i>

01:12:18.881 --> 01:12:23.580
<i>With just your name?</i>

01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:31.753
<i>And would I be sure
that this is love</i>

01:12:31.827 --> 01:12:35.456
<i>Beyond compare?</i>

01:12:38.534 --> 01:12:41.332
<i>Would all this be true</i>

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:44.564
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:12:45.274 --> 01:12:46.935
<i>For</i>

01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:49.375
<i>you?</i>

01:12:52.515 --> 01:12:55.416
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:13:00.022 --> 01:13:02.547
<i>Would it be the same?</i>

01:13:07.296 --> 01:13:13.098
<i>Would my every prayer
begin and end</i>

01:13:14.136 --> 01:13:17.799
<i>With just your name?</i>

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:27.706
<i>And would I be sure
that this is love</i>

01:13:27.783 --> 01:13:31.344
<i>Beyond compare?</i>

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:38.422
<i>Would all this be true</i>

01:13:39.161 --> 01:13:41.789
<i>If I didn't care</i>

01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:45.792
<i>For</i>

01:13:48.237 --> 01:13:50.330
<i>you?</i>

01:14:20.369 --> 01:14:22.837
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

01:14:23.973 --> 01:14:25.167
<i>Really.</i>

01:14:26.909 --> 01:14:30.640
<i>Well, let's try something a
little more upbeat, shall we?</i>

01:14:39.355 --> 01:14:41.949
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an air raid shelter!

01:14:42.024 --> 01:14:43.958
Sir, stay...
- I'm going home.

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:45.391
You don't want to put
your wife in danger.

01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:46.758
My wife?
She doesn't know I'm here.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.638
I'm here, Delysia.
- Guinevere, I'm scared.

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:58.673
It's just a drill.
I'm sure it's just a drill.

01:14:58.774 --> 01:15:00.036
But it won't always be,
will it?

01:15:01.477 --> 01:15:02.501
We're going to war,
aren't we?

01:15:02.578 --> 01:15:04.341
Yes, we are.

01:15:04.413 --> 01:15:08.543
And that is why you must not waste
a second of this precious life.

01:15:08.617 --> 01:15:10.084
Listen to me.

01:15:10.152 --> 01:15:11.881
Once, I too
had ambitions.

01:15:11.954 --> 01:15:14.752
Not your grand ones.
Simple ambitions.

01:15:14.824 --> 01:15:17.588
Marriage, children
and a house of our own.

01:15:18.427 --> 01:15:20.918
He died.
In the mud in France.

01:15:21.597 --> 01:15:23.497
A good, solid man.

01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:27.227
You would call him
dull, no doubt,

01:15:27.303 --> 01:15:31.740
but he smiled whenever he saw me,
and we could've built a life on that.

01:15:33.275 --> 01:15:35.903
Your heart knows
the truth, Delysia.

01:15:35.978 --> 01:15:38.879
Trust it,
for life is short.

01:15:44.987 --> 01:15:46.318
Michael?

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:48.319
Michael?

01:15:49.024 --> 01:15:50.491
Michael?

01:15:54.496 --> 01:15:55.520
Oh!

01:15:55.598 --> 01:15:57.589
Delysia!
My God. I...

01:15:58.267 --> 01:16:01.532
Nothing for 19 years and
then two in one day, what.

01:16:02.037 --> 01:16:03.698
I'm so sorry.

01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:06.297
The part's still yours,
darling.

01:16:09.044 --> 01:16:11.171
Well, that's all right, Phil.

01:16:11.247 --> 01:16:14.580
You enjoy your Hortensia.
In every way.

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:17.710
<i>It's just a drill, ladies and
gentlemen, it's just a drill.</i>

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.481
<i>This is the safest
place in London.</i>

01:16:19.555 --> 01:16:21.489
<i>Come on, let's have
some drinks on the house.</i>

01:16:21.557 --> 01:16:23.548
<i>And some music, please!</i>

01:16:30.566 --> 01:16:31.931
Michael?

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.272
Michael?

01:16:51.287 --> 01:16:53.187
Michael, please wait!

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:58.990
Delysia, you've made your
decision. I hope you'll be happy.

01:16:59.728 --> 01:17:02.720
Michael. Please. You have...

01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:05.596
Where do you think you're sneaking
off to? The night is young.

01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:07.465
You have the rest
of a set to sing.

01:17:07.536 --> 01:17:09.595
No, Nick,
I don't think so.

01:17:09.672 --> 01:17:11.765
Nobody walks
off my stage.

01:17:12.374 --> 01:17:14.103
She said no.

01:17:14.176 --> 01:17:15.234
What, and she does
what you say?

01:17:15.311 --> 01:17:17.142
Never once, as a matter of
fact, but that's not the point.

01:17:17.212 --> 01:17:19.407
The point is she doesn't
want to sing. End of story.

01:17:19.481 --> 01:17:21.176
Let's go, Delysia.

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:22.675
No.

01:17:23.786 --> 01:17:26.016
I'm warning you,
Calderelli.

01:17:26.655 --> 01:17:27.747
You, warning me?

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:31.822
After you, Delysia.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.229
Sock him in the jaw!

01:17:40.302 --> 01:17:41.428
What?

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:47.507
I'm a pianist, damn it.
It could ruin me.

01:17:47.576 --> 01:17:49.669
Why, you pathetic...

01:17:51.947 --> 01:17:53.209
Darling.

01:17:53.315 --> 01:17:54.646
This is your fault.

01:17:54.717 --> 01:17:56.116
Is the offer still open?

01:17:56.185 --> 01:17:57.379
Get up!

01:18:00.689 --> 01:18:03.419
Well? Is it a yes
or is it a no?

01:18:03.726 --> 01:18:04.750
What?

01:18:04.827 --> 01:18:08.126
Will you doggone marry me
or will you doggone not?

01:18:24.179 --> 01:18:26.875
Yes. God help me. Yes.

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:44.625
I don't think
I can bear it again.

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:48.629
Did you lose many?

01:19:48.697 --> 01:19:50.597
Just one. You?

01:19:52.267 --> 01:19:54.792
Almost every
school friend I had.

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.139
One tries to forget.

01:20:02.611 --> 01:20:04.511
If only one could.

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.713
You know, I distracted
myself with ridiculous things,

01:20:11.787 --> 01:20:13.880
youth, parties,
lingerie.

01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:17.721
I mean, I trained in
socks, for goodness sake.

01:20:17.793 --> 01:20:19.158
Socks?

01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:25.263
There's a great deal of engineering in
a gentleman's sock, I'll have you know.

01:20:25.334 --> 01:20:27.393
Stitching of the heel...

01:20:27.469 --> 01:20:30.495
By comparison, designing a
brassiere is a piece of cake.

01:20:30.572 --> 01:20:34.702
Not that there
aren't compensations.

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:37.142
None of them
over 20, I imagine.

01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:41.679
And all very easy
on the eye.

01:20:42.985 --> 01:20:44.748
But you know what?

01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:47.711
I'm done with it.

01:20:47.789 --> 01:20:50.485
I'm going back
to gentlemen's hosiery.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:53.392
You know who you are
with an honest pair of socks.

01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:56.060
You certainly do.

01:21:03.872 --> 01:21:06.170
Told you about Gerry,
has she?

01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:09.335
Didn't take you long
to move on, hmm?

01:21:09.411 --> 01:21:10.503
Joe?

01:21:11.446 --> 01:21:13.141
Hello, Edythe.

01:21:13.215 --> 01:21:17.049
Did she also tell you that she hangs
around the soup kitchen at the station?

01:21:17.119 --> 01:21:21.681
A tramp masquerading as some
sort of social secretary, my God.

01:21:27.396 --> 01:21:29.330
Goodbye,
Mr. Blomfield.

01:21:40.976 --> 01:21:43.171
No, actually,
she didn't.

01:21:43.946 --> 01:21:47.746
Neither about that,
nor about you and Gerry.

01:21:48.817 --> 01:21:51.911
But I'm grateful for
the truth, for a change.

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:30.819
Hello?

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.157
Delysia?

01:22:42.638 --> 01:22:44.128
Miss Lafosse?

01:22:50.312 --> 01:22:52.507
Come on, come on,
the taxi's waiting.

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:55.248
Michael,
don't rush me!

01:22:55.984 --> 01:22:59.078
Guinevere! Are you all
right? We've been so worried.

01:22:59.154 --> 01:23:00.815
Perfectly well,
thank you.

01:23:00.889 --> 01:23:02.426
We've been scouring London for you.

01:23:02.427 --> 01:23:03.084
Miss Lafosse...

01:23:03.158 --> 01:23:05.149
You have not been at the roulette
wheel all night, have you?

01:23:05.227 --> 01:23:08.162
Please, Delysia,
I'm trying to apologize.

01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:11.825
I expect you've heard that I am
not a social secretary at all.

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.596
I'm afraid I found
myself pretending.

01:23:15.437 --> 01:23:19.806
Miss Pettigrew, if that's you
pretending, then you're jolly good at it.

01:23:20.942 --> 01:23:22.068
Guinevere,

01:23:22.144 --> 01:23:25.705
Sarah Grubb is not going to
judge anybody for pretending.

01:23:25.781 --> 01:23:29.512
Come on, Grubb! This is
us, I'm afraid, Miss Pettigrew.

01:23:29.584 --> 01:23:31.518
Boat won't wait.

01:23:31.586 --> 01:23:33.486
Are you really going?
- Mmm-hmm!

01:23:34.356 --> 01:23:36.324
To New York?
- Yep.

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:38.382
How wonderful.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.224
But, Guinevere,
what will you do?

01:23:41.963 --> 01:23:43.931
Don't you worry
about me, petal.

01:23:43.999 --> 01:23:48.163
Why, Miss Holt is holding a job
for me this very morning, I expect.

01:23:57.479 --> 01:24:00.607
I will never forget the day
we spent together.

01:24:01.516 --> 01:24:02.915
Not ever.

01:24:04.553 --> 01:24:05.952
Nor I.

01:24:11.893 --> 01:24:14.191
Oh, goodbye, Guinevere.
I love you.

01:24:14.262 --> 01:24:16.025
Off with you. Away.

01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:22.434
Oh, come and visit!
New York's bopping!

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:34.774
Forgive the intrusion.

01:25:37.813 --> 01:25:39.337
I'm glad to see
you're safe.

01:25:39.414 --> 01:25:41.075
Oh, yes. Quite safe.

01:25:47.255 --> 01:25:51.282
Am I right in thinking you're no
longer employed, Miss Pettigrew?

01:25:51.359 --> 01:25:52.883
Quite correct.

01:25:52.961 --> 01:25:55.259
So you're free?
- Quite free.

01:25:56.097 --> 01:25:59.157
Might you be looking
for a social secretary?

01:25:59.234 --> 01:26:00.758
No. Absolutely not.

01:26:00.969 --> 01:26:01.958
Oh.

01:26:04.773 --> 01:26:06.570
I'm looking for you.

01:26:08.143 --> 01:26:09.201
Me?

01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:14.171
I've been looking for you
all night, and, I believe

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:16.980
all of my life.

01:26:18.854 --> 01:26:20.651
If you'll have me.

01:26:26.027 --> 01:26:28.860
A nod of the head
will do me fine.

01:26:34.836 --> 01:26:38.203
And I am, at a stroke,
the happiest man in London.

01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:57.488
What a night.
- What a morning.

01:26:58.627 --> 01:27:00.975
Have you eaten,
my dear Guinevere?

01:27:00.976 --> 01:27:01.528
Oh, Joe,

01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:05.032
I have not eaten for
a very, very long time.

01:27:34.329 --> 01:27:36.007
<i>Some music, please!</i>
