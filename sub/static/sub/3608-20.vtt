00:02.001 --> 00:03.670
Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:05.129
Jason.

00:09.218 --> 00:13.262
These people are smart.
And they're animals.

00:14.056 --> 00:17.767
And if you think that one gun
and one bullet is gonna stop them,

00:19.895 --> 00:21.396
think again.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.358
I'm going after my son
and nobody is going to stop me, OK?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.361
- I'll come with you.
- No. I have to do it alone.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.364
I'm going out to the line
that we're not supposed to cross,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.366
and telling them that we've got you.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.244
They'll never give you Walt.

00:44.211 --> 00:48.798
Michael!

00:52.970 --> 00:54.303
What's wrong with him?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.438
Jack! Where are you going?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.313
Maybe they just let him go.

01:06.567 --> 01:11.028
Let him go? He's alone! They didn't just
push him out into the jungle, Jack.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.447
He's alone!

01:16.994 --> 01:18.411
OK.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.705
Let's go.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.086
Whoa.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.037
See ya, Ana Lucia.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.085
You look tired.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.753
Yeah, thanks.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.257
What?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.635
Where were you last night?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.553
- Home.
- All night?

02:18.096 --> 02:21.516
Yeah. I cooked myself some dinner,
watched some TV.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.309
What'd you watch?

02:27.523 --> 02:29.524
Let's go for a drive.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.781
Remember Jason McCormack?

02:39.243 --> 02:42.203
Found him in a parking lot
just after three in the morning.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.622
He was dead an hour
before anyone saw him.

02:45.082 --> 02:49.001
Crime Scene pulled a gun from the
dumpster. Registration was filed off.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.088
No prints. No witnesses.
He was executed.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.591
Any idea who did it?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.636
Yeah, Ana. You did.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.391
This man confesses to shooting you
in cold blood and you refuse to ID him.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.768
So we had to cut him loose.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.271
A week later,
he shows up with five bullets in him

03:08.355 --> 03:10.356
because someone shot him in cold blood.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.485
Guess I should get a lawyer.

03:14.570 --> 03:18.948
Look, we both know that this is gonna be
a dead-end investigation.

03:19.616 --> 03:24.453
But, Ana, if you did this,
you have to let me help you.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.040
Yeah. Thanks, Mom,
but I don't need your help.

03:28.125 --> 03:32.128
You don't want my help, you're gonna
have to get it from somewhere else.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.299
You're a police officer, Ana.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.846
If you don't respect me,
at least respect that.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.272
Then I quit.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.580
Hey, Henry, what do you say?

04:10.834 --> 04:14.086
How long you gonna keep up
this hunger strike, Henry?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.346
I ever tell you I was a cop?

04:26.516 --> 04:29.352
I've been around
a lot of killers in my life.

04:30.354 --> 04:33.147
You know what surprises me
the most about them?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.777
How much they love to talk.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.532
But you're different, Henry.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.537
Quiet.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.379
What was that?

05:01.009 --> 05:04.136
If you're gonna say something,
you're gonna have to speak...

05:12.270 --> 05:15.898
You killed two of us.
Good people who were leaving you alone.

05:21.238 --> 05:25.032
You're the killer, Ana Lucia.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.637
I guess he decided to start talking,
huh?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.371
...with you at all times.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.709
Unattended articles will be promptly
removed by law enforcement personnel.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.379
Please report any unattended articles
or suspicious behavior

06:20.464 --> 06:22.214
to police or security...

06:26.553 --> 06:28.679
Hey, Mike. Tequila-tonic.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.140
Long day, huh?

06:34.478 --> 06:36.312
Good to see you again.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.733
You "wanded" me at security.

06:44.446 --> 06:48.199
Another one, please.
So how does one get into "wanding?"

06:50.619 --> 06:52.578
One stops being a cop.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.706
What a coincidence.
I just stopped being a doctor.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.419
- Why'd you quit?
- I didn't.

07:00.504 --> 07:05.883
My son ratted me out
for drinking on the job. Thank you.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.928
Lost my license.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.265
Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.519
No, no, it's just that,

07:17.104 --> 07:20.606
I don't believe that parents
and their kids should work together.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.108
Too many issues.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.360
I'll drink to that.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.201
- So, where you headed?
- Sydney. Sydney, Australia.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.330
You wanna come?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.000
I'm serious.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.295
Why would I go to Sydney with you?

07:43.380 --> 07:46.090
Maybe fate has just thrown
the two of us together.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.260
You know,
like two drinks in an airport bar.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.055
Why would fate do that?

07:53.974 --> 07:57.518
Same reason fate does anything,
so that we can help each other out.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.105
You do need help, right?

08:03.525 --> 08:05.151
Unless you don't.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.160
What I'm doing down there
could be dangerous.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.579
I need someone to protect me,
a bodyguard.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.833
It's perfect for someone who
"stopped being a cop."

08:26.756 --> 08:28.591
I don't even know your name.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.510
Let's not use real names.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.513
I'll tell you what, why don't you
pick a name for me,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.599
and then I'll pick one for you.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.857
- You look like a "Tom."
- Tom. What an excellent name.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.027
And you should be a...

08:48.111 --> 08:49.361
"Sarah."

08:55.118 --> 08:56.911
Australia.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.557
What happened?

09:19.601 --> 09:21.810
I cut myself shaving.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.485
The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.908
You OK?

09:38.161 --> 09:41.247
I'm fine. But he won't be.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.542
- Hey, Ana?
- What?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.463
Don't do anything stupid.

10:23.373 --> 10:28.085
If you've come to apologize, I forgive
you for hitting me with your crutch.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.716
I'm so glad my head didn't break it.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.927
Why?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.640
Now that's a broad question.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.395
Why did you try to hurt Ana Lucia
but not me?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.233
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at, John.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.153
I was trapped under that blast door.

10:55.238 --> 10:59.366
Helpless. You could've crushed my skull.
But you didn't do a thing.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.661
Why didn't you?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.372
Because you're one of the good ones,
John.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.209
What? Good what?

11:11.421 --> 11:13.839
None of this matters. I'm dead anyway.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
The doctor's gone to make a trade,

11:17.677 --> 11:20.721
and we both know he'll come back
empty-handed, and then...

11:22.015 --> 11:23.432
I've lost my value.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.686
So either Jack comes back here
and kills me

11:27.771 --> 11:31.690
or my people find out where
I'm being held and they do it.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.109
Why would your own people
want to kill you?

11:35.737 --> 11:38.030
Because the man in charge...

11:39.616 --> 11:42.951
He's a great man, John, a brilliant man.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.082
But he is not a forgiving man.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.003
He'll kill me because I failed, John.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.465
I failed my mission.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.219
What mission?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.640
When that woman caught me in her trap,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.477
I was on my way here, John.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.439
I was coming for you.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.652
Locke!

12:18.655 --> 12:20.531
Locke, get out here!

12:26.621 --> 12:27.913
John!

12:53.189 --> 12:56.525
Hey, I've been knocking those things
down for 20 minutes.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.485
Get your hands off my damn mangoes.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.029
Didn't figure you
for the fruit-picking type.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.031
What do you want?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.242
I need a gun.

13:06.619 --> 13:11.373
Well, here's an idea: why not go to
your buddy Jack? He's got himself a gun.

13:12.208 --> 13:16.086
That's right; he's still traipsing
around the jungle with Kate.

13:16.171 --> 13:19.965
If you've got a problem because
he's making time with your girlfriend,

13:20.049 --> 13:22.092
don't take it out on me, man.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.304
How about you just give me a gun?

13:26.681 --> 13:29.433
Here's another idea: scram.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.770
You heard me. Now, git!

14:05.762 --> 14:06.970
Sarah!

14:10.517 --> 14:12.726
Sarah, open the damn door!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.523
Good, you're up.

14:17.607 --> 14:21.193
It's time. Protection duty.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.446
Come on, let's go.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.282
After four days of drinking
and doing nothing,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.868
now, in the middle of the night,
you're ready to go?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.870
That's exactly right.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.916
It's time, come on.
Fate's calling, Sarah.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.807
This is it. Pull over, right here.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.647
This is what you needed protection for?
The suburbs?

14:59.357 --> 15:01.316
Just stay in the car.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.443
Should I keep the meter running?

15:40.523 --> 15:44.735
Look, she's my daughter
and I have every right to see her!

15:44.819 --> 15:47.863
- No, you don't have a right. Get out!
- I'm coming in here!

15:47.947 --> 15:51.241
- You can't stop me!
- Get out! Get out of my house!

15:51.326 --> 15:53.994
I pay the mortgage on this house!
And you won't...

15:54.787 --> 15:57.956
- I wanna see my daughter!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

15:58.041 --> 16:00.792
Don't you ever come back here!

16:00.877 --> 16:03.211
I was just having a conversation
with the lady.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.047
You need help!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.984
- Dude, nice hole.
- What is it, Hurley?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.780
Hey, man,
you remember that radio we made?

16:30.531 --> 16:34.951
I was thinking maybe I could get it
to play some music. You know, for Libby.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.914
Well, it worked only once,
and then just for a minute.

16:39.582 --> 16:43.335
I've tried several times since
and only gotten static.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.088
Here's the thing:
even that would be good.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.841
Because Libby would be like,
"It's the thought that counts."

16:49.926 --> 16:51.510
And I'll score major points.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.221
Especially when she sees me
holding it over my head.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.641
And why would you hold a
static-generating radio over your head?

16:58.893 --> 17:01.937
They didn't have Say Anything
in Baghdad? It's awesome.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.397
This dude gets his boom box,

17:03.481 --> 17:06.108
holds it over his head
outside this chick's window,

17:06.192 --> 17:09.861
and plays some Peter Gabriel song
for her, and, bam, the girl's his.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.531
After her dad goes to jail.
But then he gets her.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.367
- I think I get the idea.
- You should check it out sometime.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.287
I mean, if we ever, you know,
get off this island.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.376
If you want to do something nice
for Libby,

17:24.460 --> 17:28.003
there's a beautiful beach
three kilometers from here.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.298
You could take her there.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.969
You think she'd like that?

17:37.348 --> 17:39.141
I took Shannon there once.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.314
Michael.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.821
So it worked?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.741
What are you talking about, John?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.826
Your deal. The trade.

17:59.162 --> 18:02.164
- If they gave us Michael...
- They didn't give us anything.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.209
So it was just a coincidence
that he came wandering out?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.462
I was shouting. He heard my voice.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.467
What? They just let Michael go,

18:13.551 --> 18:15.927
hoping we would keep up
our end of the bargain?

18:16.012 --> 18:18.513
You think they're on the honor system?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.687
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.669
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.258
I know you're there.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.096
Don't make me come in after you.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.565
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

19:12.068 --> 19:16.530
Little Red Riding Hood following the
Big Bad Wolf back to his stash o' guns?

19:17.615 --> 19:19.783
Why don't you gimme
that one right there?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.202
I ain't gonna "gimme" you nothing.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.789
We've been through this, Lucy.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.472
What you gonna do now, muchacha?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.597
We need some damn music in here.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.143
- Who was she?
- Who was who?

20:28.227 --> 20:32.439
- That woman.
- She is a very long story, Sarah.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.026
It's Ana Lucia.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.695
Well, I'm still Tom.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.491
- You're pathetic, that's what you are.
- You bet your sweet ass I am.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.375
Why are you here?

20:54.295 --> 20:57.797
I'm here because I can't apologize
to my son.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.052
He tried to help me,
so I thanked him by cutting him off.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.220
I thanked him by hating him.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.561
You came here for the same reason
I did, kiddo.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.521
You ran away.

21:22.657 --> 21:27.035
My, my. Look what fate
has delivered up this time.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.122
Come on.

21:31.207 --> 21:35.377
Let's go have a drink or ten and be
pathetic together. What do you say?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.387
No.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.564
It's your call.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.986
Hey, I'm walking here!

22:05.908 --> 22:07.325
Wait!

22:07.910 --> 22:09.494
Don't.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.832
Let's just get the hell out of Sydney.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.252
Let's just go. Let's go back.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.090
I can't ever go back.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.096
See ya, kiddo.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.450
What?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.953
Don't you want my phone number?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.584
You tell anyone about this,

22:59.211 --> 23:01.212
and I'll kill you.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.259
Guess that takes cuddling off the table.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.609
Hey, there.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.195
How's it going?

23:25.696 --> 23:29.657
- This isn't what it looks like.
- And what does it look like?

23:31.660 --> 23:34.829
It looks like something...

23:35.498 --> 23:38.124
...that it's not.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.589
Aw, man, I'm so busted.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.259
Hurley, I'm not here to tell you
how to act around food.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.847
No, I'm not busted for that.
I'm busted for...

23:55.017 --> 23:57.018
...something else.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.855
I was packing a picnic,

24:00.940 --> 24:04.442
because I was kind of hoping
that you'd wanna go with me.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.237
You know, as an "us" thing.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.574
But it was a surprise.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.912
Really?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.459
That's very sweet.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.383
So, do you wanna go?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.886
- Where to?
- Can that part still be a surprise?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.014
Yeah.

24:48.737 --> 24:52.198
- Hey. You're back.
- Hey.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.162
So, the Others, they didn't show up?

24:57.246 --> 25:00.165
No. Michael's back, though.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.546
- What happened here?
- My fault.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.840
I left the tap on in the bathroom sink,

25:08.924 --> 25:13.178
and Ana wiped out and hit her head
on the counter. And I'm sorry, again.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.433
Yeah, don't worry about it.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.898
I think he's waking up.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.776
Michael! Hey, Michael?

25:30.321 --> 25:33.156
- Jack?
- Hey, man.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.826
Man, where...
How did I get...

25:36.911 --> 25:40.246
Wait, try to take it easy, OK?
You're back in the hatch.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.832
We found you out in the jungle
last night.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.335
Oh, my head.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.796
Welcome back.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.300
Hey, John.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.474
I found them.

26:04.563 --> 26:09.984
After I left, I hiked north.
Back to where we were.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.948
Hiked to the beach,
followed the shoreline.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.493
A day later, I saw one.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.830
- What did he look like?
- He was dirty.

26:23.624 --> 26:26.668
Worn clothing. No shoes. Simple.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.504
Just like the rest of them.

26:30.339 --> 26:35.551
- Like the rest of them?
- Yeah. His people. The Others.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.680
I followed him back to his camp.

26:39.682 --> 26:44.269
They live in tents.
Canvas tents and teepees.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.355
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

26:48.649 --> 26:52.277
- How many of them were there?
- I counted 22.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.279
- And the boat...
- I didn't see it.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.532
Did you see Walt?

27:00.202 --> 27:01.452
No.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.747
But I know he's there.

27:04.832 --> 27:09.544
What about everyone else they took?
Cindy? Did you see any other kids?

27:11.714 --> 27:13.965
No. No, no kids.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.802
But I think they're in the same place
as my boy.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.597
- They have a hatch.
- How do you know that they...

27:21.682 --> 27:25.226
There's a set of metal doors leading
underground. What else could it be?

27:25.311 --> 27:27.645
You think that's where
they keep the kids?

27:27.730 --> 27:31.399
They keep it guarded 24/7.
Two guards, two guns.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.736
And two guns is all I saw.
They're barely armed.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.613
Most of them are old.
And half of them are women.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.493
I wanted to...

27:48.751 --> 27:50.793
I couldn't save him.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.172
So I came back to tell you.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.676
To tell you that we can take them.

28:01.096 --> 28:05.308
As soon as I get my strength back,
I will take us back there.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.644
And we are gonna get my boy back.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.752
You were right.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.549
- Right about what?
- About Henry.

28:41.095 --> 28:46.641
What you and Sayid did to him when
you first found him, you were right.

28:48.018 --> 28:52.647
I don't like how you did it,
but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.

28:55.025 --> 28:59.821
Well, you did what you thought was right
at the time you thought it, Jack.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.701
I just hope the next time you decide
to do something, you include me.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.581
And something tells me
that's gonna be soon.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.879
You heard Michael. We can take them.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.299
Our friend with the beard
told us not to cross the line.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.427
These people are liars, John.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.596
Why the hell should we take their word
on anything?

29:26.515 --> 29:28.349
I couldn't agree more.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.935
So,

29:32.604 --> 29:34.063
now what?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.943
Where are you going?

29:39.027 --> 29:41.279
To get our guns back from Sawyer.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.531
We're gonna need you
to help convince him.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.952
- Who's gonna take care of Michael?
- I'll stay. You guys go ahead.

29:48.662 --> 29:51.038
- You sure?
- Give Sawyer my best.

29:51.874 --> 29:54.375
All right. We'll be back soon.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.637
Watch your head. Almost there.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.806
You ever watch The Flintstones?

30:08.891 --> 30:12.226
Sure, I used to watch it all the time
when I was in the hospital.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.396
When I broke my hip.

30:16.231 --> 30:20.818
Did you ever notice how Fred would run
by the same thing over and over again?

30:20.903 --> 30:22.904
Third time past this tree.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.117
That's a different tree.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.954
Hurley, it's OK if you're lost.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.832
Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me?

30:34.917 --> 30:39.837
We're right about to walk onto the most
excellent secret beach on the island,

30:39.922 --> 30:42.590
and... surprise!

30:46.970 --> 30:49.597
Hurley, this is our beach.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.517
There's Jin.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.692
Hey, I tell you what,
why not have the picnic here?

31:01.777 --> 31:05.655
- Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?

31:07.616 --> 31:09.659
You don't have any blankets?

31:11.119 --> 31:13.287
How about drinks?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.793
OK, I tell you what,
I will handle the blankets,

31:18.877 --> 31:23.047
you just track down Rose and Bernard. I
saw them pull wine from the pallet. OK?

31:25.467 --> 31:27.176
Wine.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.555
Groovy.

31:31.223 --> 31:34.725
Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough
I'll remember where I know you from.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.980
Yeah. OK.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.498
Sawyer.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.295
- Put the book down.
- It's not a book, it's a manuscript.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.548
I'm about to be the first and only guy
to find out "whodunit".

32:06.842 --> 32:09.385
I think I got it figured out,
so cool your damn jets

32:09.469 --> 32:12.763
and walk around the coconut trees.
I got ten pages left.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.348
Hey!

32:15.142 --> 32:17.143
Want to figure it out?

32:20.522 --> 32:21.647
Jeez!

32:22.941 --> 32:24.942
What the hell is your problem, Doc?

32:25.027 --> 32:27.111
It's time to give us the guns back.

32:27.988 --> 32:31.032
- You burn the ending of my book...
- Where are they, James?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.618
- You too, Brutus?
- Just take us there. All right?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.620
Quit playing around.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.955
You bring her along for a sympathy vote?

32:38.040 --> 32:41.917
She ain't in my head, Doc, so why don't
you two just go play in the jungle?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.962
Take us to the guns. Now.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.554
That bitch.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.558
She stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.937
- Why would she need a gun?
- Son of a bitch!

33:04.816 --> 33:06.359
Jack.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.156
I need to tell you something.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.584
Pick it up.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.759
Cut yourself loose.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.011
What?

33:34.096 --> 33:36.097
Just do it.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.975
Why?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.229
You know why.

34:06.420 --> 34:09.380
He kept saying you were misunderstood.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.590
What are you talking about?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.135
Goodwin.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.222
Yes. He told us all about you, Ana.

34:19.349 --> 34:22.810
How he thought you were worthy,
that he could change you.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.317
But he was wrong.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.411
And it cost him his life.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.250
He was gonna kill me.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.969
Was he?

35:02.392 --> 35:04.059
Are you done?

35:06.021 --> 35:08.147
Yes, Ana. I'm done.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.033
So, this is it, huh?

35:21.244 --> 35:24.246
Yes, Henry. This is it.

35:32.047 --> 35:36.050
I want you to listen to me, OK?
Because I am asking you a favor.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.720
Chrissy, I'm standing
in front of you in the same suit

35:39.805 --> 35:43.224
that I'm wearing to my father's funeral
and I'm asking you a favor.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.935
In 16 hours I need to land at LAX.

35:47.062 --> 35:50.731
I need that coffin to clear Customs
because there will be a hearse waiting.

35:51.525 --> 35:56.237
And I need that hearse to take me and
that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy?

35:56.321 --> 35:59.865
Why can't I just bring him to a funeral
home and make all the arrangements?

35:59.950 --> 36:02.576
Why can't I really take my time with it?
Because...

36:03.411 --> 36:05.371
Because I need it to be done.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.624
I need it to be over.

36:11.378 --> 36:15.047
I just... I need to bury my father.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.477
That was an airplane.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.647
No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.192
That's right. Australia.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.742
I don't know, I...

36:50.584 --> 36:52.793
I made a mistake, Mom.

36:55.797 --> 36:59.300
You knew, so I got as far away
from you as I could.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.474
But now...

37:09.686 --> 37:11.854
I wanna come home, Mommy.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.694
So come home.

37:24.618 --> 37:26.911
I'm on Oceanic Flight 815.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.500
I'll be there when you land, mija.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.397
Where is everybody?

37:56.358 --> 37:58.651
What you said got them worked up.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.445
They went to get all the guns back
from Sawyer.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.530
Sawyer?

38:05.825 --> 38:07.993
Sawyer has all the guns?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.872
Long story.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.127
At least he didn't get that one.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.381
Yeah.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.509
Too bad I can't use it.

38:25.428 --> 38:29.223
- Use it on what?
- We caught one of them.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.141
The Others.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.603
He's locked up in there.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.400
- How long has he...
- Over a week.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.195
And you're, what, taking care of him?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.740
He tried to kill me today.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.997
So I wanted him dead.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.760
I couldn't do it.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.973
I couldn't even kill him.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.939
I looked at him, and he...

39:25.864 --> 39:28.365
I can't do this anymore.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.547
Then let me do it.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.846
They're animals.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.267
I've seen these people
and they are animals.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.439
They took my son. Right out of my hands.
They took my son, and...

40:04.861 --> 40:07.321
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.244
'Cause that's what they'd do.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.212
What's the combination?

40:29.219 --> 40:31.011
Eighteen right.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.848
One left.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.893
Thirty-one right.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.538
I'm sorry.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.499
For what?

41:26.860 --> 41:27.860
Michael?
