WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.770
There you go.

00:02.803 --> 00:03.804
Oh.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.373
[snickering]

00:08.442 --> 00:09.643
Nice dress, Ryan.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.480
It's not a dress.
It's a kurta.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.581
[laughing]
Okay.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.249
Tonight,
one of our most

00:15.283 --> 00:17.351
ethnic coworkers,
Kelly,

00:17.385 --> 00:20.054
has invited us all
to a Diwali celebration

00:20.088 --> 00:22.090
put on by her community.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.757
What is Diwali,
you may ask?

00:23.791 --> 00:27.395
Well, to have Kelly
explain it,

00:27.428 --> 00:28.629
[high voice]
"It's..."

00:28.662 --> 00:30.664
[gibberish]

00:30.698 --> 00:32.233
"It's so super, fun.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.168
And it's gonna be great."

00:34.202 --> 00:36.337
A lot of gods
with unpronounceable names.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.139
20 minutes later,
you find out

00:38.172 --> 00:40.741
that it's essentially
a Hindu Halloween.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.176
You look so handsome.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.211
You really do.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.213
I love the material.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.314
I know.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.515
How come you didn't
get me one?

00:48.782 --> 00:49.783
I...

00:49.817 --> 00:52.786
[piano rock]

00:52.820 --> 01:00.828
*

01:21.815 --> 01:24.318
Okay, so between
Meredith's minivan,

01:24.352 --> 01:25.753
and if I borrow Bob's Yukon,

01:25.786 --> 01:28.189
that should fit
about 12 people.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.823
I actually might not go.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.559
I'm feeling kind of tired.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.560
Do you wanna make Appletinis

01:32.593 --> 01:33.494
and watch Sex and the City
at my place?

01:33.527 --> 01:37.898
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.167
I don't get
why you won't go.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.134
Did I do something wrong?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.835
I mean, I thought we
were really close friends.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.837
I just feel kind of tired,
you know.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.139
Maybe you've got mono.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.174
Maybe.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.475
I just...

01:47.508 --> 01:48.776
I don't really have
anyone to go with.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.511
Well, go with Dwight.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.146
He's single too right?

01:52.180 --> 01:53.314
Yeah, totally single.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.616
100% available.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.786
Are you guys going to this
Indian thing tonight?

01:58.819 --> 02:02.556
I don't know.
Who's, uh, who's going?

02:02.590 --> 02:05.859
Ohh...you mean, like,
is Pam going?

02:05.893 --> 02:08.229
Don't go.
They eat monkey brains.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.164
(Michael)
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.232
That is offensive.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.934
Indians do not
eat monkey brains.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.736
And if they do...

02:15.769 --> 02:17.671
sign me up.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.607
Because I am sure
that they are very tasty.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.410
And nutritional.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.747
It's important
that this company

02:26.780 --> 02:29.750
celebrates its diversity.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.819
And you know what, Stanley?

02:31.852 --> 02:34.455
Come Kwanzaa time,
I have got you covered, baby.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.257
I don't celebrate
Kwanzaa.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.825
Wha--really?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.793
You should.
It's fun.

02:39.827 --> 02:43.397
I love the people here.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.935
And if there was one thing
I don't really care for,

02:47.968 --> 02:51.839
is that they can be
terribly, terribly ignorant

02:51.872 --> 02:53.707
about other cultures.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.976
And I don't want them
embarrassing me

02:56.009 --> 02:58.612
in front
of my girlfriend Carol.

02:58.646 --> 03:02.350
Diwali is a very
important holiday

03:02.383 --> 03:03.517
for the Hindus.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.253
But, frankly,
I'm a little appalled

03:05.286 --> 03:09.357
that none of you know very much
about Indian culture.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.859
So with out further adieu,
Kelly!

03:11.892 --> 03:14.962
You are on.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.431
Um, Diwali is awesome.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.732
And there's food,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.568
and there's gonna be dancing.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.703
And, oh,
I got the raddest outfit.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.705
It has sparkles--
Kelly...

03:24.738 --> 03:26.974
Um, why don't you tell us
a little bit about

03:27.007 --> 03:29.577
the origins of the holiday?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.913
Oh, um, I don't know.
It's really old, I think.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.948
How many gods
do you have?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.984
Like hundreds, I think.
Maybe more than that.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.019
And that blue, busty gal--
what's her story?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
(Kevin)
She looks like Pam

03:40.588 --> 03:41.922
from the neck down.

03:41.955 --> 03:42.923
(Dwight)
Pam wishes.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.858
[laughter]

03:44.892 --> 03:46.660
Kelly, I'll take this one.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.930
Diwali is a celebration
of the coronation god king Rama

03:49.963 --> 03:52.400
after his epic battle
with Ravena,

03:52.433 --> 03:53.634
the demon king of Lanka.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.669
It symbolizes the battle
between good and evil.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.438
All right, all right.
This isn't Lord of the Rings.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.239
Hey, Polly.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.843
Oops, sorry.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.445
Sorry.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.047
I started biking to work.
Josh does it.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.750
And he lives a lot
farther away than I do.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.819
And also, it saves gas money.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.922
It keeps me in shape.
Helps the environment.

04:14.955 --> 04:19.993
And now I know it makes me
really sweaty for work.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.863
Nice basket.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.998
Thank you.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.969
Now, a lot of people say

04:29.002 --> 04:31.472
that Kelly
is one in a million.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.806
And that's true,
but it's also not true.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.642
Because, frankly,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.510
there are literally
billions of people

04:36.544 --> 04:38.379
just like Kelly
in the world.

04:38.412 --> 04:41.615
Here are some
famous Indians.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.721
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.058
He is a Nobel-Prize-winning
physicist.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.626
Impressive.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.027
Apu, from The Simpsons.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.664
Hilarious Indian.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.898
M. Night Shyamalan.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.100
The Village, Unbreakable,
Sixth Sense.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.969
I see dead people.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.071
Okay!
Spoiler alert.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.773
He was dead
the whole time.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.441
Just stop it!

05:07.475 --> 05:09.009
What's--
Oh, wha--

05:09.042 --> 05:10.110
[laughs]

05:10.143 --> 05:11.612
Where did that come from?

05:15.449 --> 05:16.850
Karen, my chips got stuck

05:16.884 --> 05:18.386
in the vending machine
again.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.921
I need your...
skinny little arms.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.356
Oh.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.391
Did you shake it?

05:23.424 --> 05:26.326
Yeah, I shook it,
I shook it.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.466
We have such
a roller coaster thing,

05:32.500 --> 05:33.534
Karen and I.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.369
Excuse me?

05:35.403 --> 05:36.837
Roller-coastery friendship.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.373
Hot and cold.
On again, off again.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.743
Sexual-tension-filled
type of deal.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.945
It's very Sam and Diane.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.947
Wow.
From Cheers.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.115
Yep.
Yeah.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.451
And another thing about
the Indian people,

05:50.484 --> 05:52.386
they love sex positions.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.923
I present to you
The Kama Sutra.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.692
I mean, look at that.
Who has seen that before?

05:58.726 --> 06:01.495
I have, that's
the union of the monkey.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.831
Oh, that's
what they call it.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.833
This is the best meeting
we have ever had.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.667
(Michael)
Thank you, Kevin.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.802
I find this
incredibly offensive.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.538
Well, I find it beautiful.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.474
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do
in her own house is fine.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.175
But we shouldn't
all be subjected to it.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.110
Actually, she's right.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.513
This isn't appropriate.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.748
Why don't I take these?

06:20.781 --> 06:21.949
(Michael)
You're not gonna collect them.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.117
No, this is delightful,
charming culture.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.887
My Indian cultural seminar
was going great

06:26.920 --> 06:29.957
until Toby decided
that he was too immature

06:29.990 --> 06:32.626
to deal with
culturally explicit images.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.162
It's just sex, people.
Everybody does it.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.965
I'm doing it with Carol.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.968
Probably tonight.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.571
All right.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.972
I think you guys
should be all set.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.907
Oh, here's the corporate card
for dinner.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.542
Thanks.
Now, Karen...

06:48.576 --> 06:50.210
Let's keep it
to $20 a person this time.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.880
Got it.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
Once a quarter,
the sales staff at this branch

06:55.148 --> 06:58.486
has to stay late to do
order form consolidation.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.954
Which...amazingly,

07:00.988 --> 07:03.223
is even less interesting
than it sounds.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.759
You guys ready to party?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.094
What's that?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.463
I said, are you ready

07:09.497 --> 07:11.599
to part-ay!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.868
[Indian music]

07:14.902 --> 07:19.940
*

07:19.973 --> 07:22.510
Isn't this fun,
not wearing shoes?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.177
I wish some of us still
had our shoes on.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.714
Stop it.
It's a disease.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.448
I've...told you.

07:30.017 --> 07:33.220
I thought you said
this was a costume party.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.090
What does that
look like to you?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.192
An Indian woman
in a sari.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.861
No one's even gonna
notice it.

07:40.894 --> 07:41.995
Nice outfit.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.731
Hey, Kevin,
it's a costume.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.933
You just cool it, okay?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.234
Carol? Carol.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.938
I'll have one of those
as well.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.105
Thank you very much.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
Now, these are limes,
lemons, onions.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.143
I'm a vegetarian.
What can I eat?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.512
It's all vegetarian.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.913
I'll just have some bread.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.818
You used your hands.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.722
Oh, yuck.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.723
Oh.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.924
[gagging]

08:10.958 --> 08:13.060
What, a little too spicy?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.528
Yeah.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.729
These s'mores
are disgusting.

08:15.763 --> 08:19.132
They're not s'mores.
They're samosas.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.736
Do you think
they have any s'mores?

08:22.770 --> 08:25.606
All they are is chocolate,
graham cracker, and marshmallow.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.274
How difficult would
that have been?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.213
So...you're Kelly's
sisters, huh?

Rupa, Neefa, Tiffany,

08:40.788 --> 08:42.155
stop acting like such
little losers,

08:42.189 --> 08:43.156
and just be cool.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.058
Come on, Ryan.
Come on.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.895
Leave him alone.
I hate you guys.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.663
They said something
about Zach Braff.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.998
Don't even listen to them.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.633
No, you know...

08:54.101 --> 08:56.103
That's very official.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.204
I decided to come.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.608
Uh, I feel a little
underdressed.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.342
But at least
I'm not dressed

09:02.375 --> 09:04.712
like a slutty cheerleader,
right?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.246
Is that mean?

wanna hear it, okay?

Stop it right now.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.718
Ryan is a temporary worker,
