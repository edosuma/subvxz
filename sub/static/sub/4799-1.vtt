01:08.640 --> 01:10.679
<i>And we're
back at the final stretch</i>

01:10.680 --> 01:12.489
<i>of the Indianapolis 500.</i>

01:12.800 --> 01:14.564
<i>Guy Gagné is
gaining on the pack.</i>

01:14.760 --> 01:17.331
<i>The young French Canadian
is making quite an impression</i>

01:17.480 --> 01:19.687
<i>in his debut
here at the Motor Speedway.</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:21.999
<i>In all my years of racing,</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:24.844
<i>I've never seen a driver
with this much raw talent.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:26.079
But what's this?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.686
Out of nowhere, a dark horse
is challenging Gagné.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.080
He's gaining on the pack.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.799
<i>And down the front stretch.</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:34.804
Moving into fourth position...
third... Now, second!

01:34.960 --> 01:36.769
<i>Going to the outside
as they cross the bricks!</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:39.764
And it looks like
the winner is Turbo!

01:39.920 --> 01:43.163
Amazing! Unbelievable!

01:43.320 --> 01:46.608
Instant replay.
Again, in super slo-mo.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.966
Whoo! Whoa!

01:54.360 --> 01:55.441
<i>Welcome back, race fans.</i>

01:55.600 --> 01:57.967
<i>We're here with Indy's
brightest new star, Guy Gagné.</i>

01:58.120 --> 02:01.044
<i>Tell us, Guy, what inspired
you to become a race driver?</i>

02:01.200 --> 02:06.240
You know, Dan, everybody's got that
one thing that makes them happy.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.607
And for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.959
<i>Guy!</i>

02:13.120 --> 02:14.884
- One at a time, please.
- Theo!

02:15.040 --> 02:16.963
Yes, the handsome
fellow in the back.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.890
What are you doing?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.771
What I've always done. Stay
focused, try to run my race.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.127
That's all any driver can do.
Next question.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.681
Can you please go to sleep?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.285
We've got work tomorrow.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.487
Sleep? Are you kidding me?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.642
It takes hours to come down
after a big race like this.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.529
Yeah, I bet. Okay.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.569
<i>They are the fuel
that keeps me running!</i>

02:37.760 --> 02:40.161
<i>Guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the Indy Lights,</i>

02:40.320 --> 02:42.687
<i>did you ever dream that you'd
be standing here today?</i>

02:42.840 --> 02:46.083
<i>Well, as my dear father
always told me,</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:50.290
<i>"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer</i>

02:50.480 --> 02:51.481
<i>too small. "</i>
Too small.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.799
Sleep!

03:03.000 --> 03:05.367
Head in the game. Head in the game.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.690
Yes! Seventeen minutes!
That's a new record!

03:28.080 --> 03:29.445
Whoo-hoo! Theo!

03:38.040 --> 03:39.121
Good morning.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.650
Let's go, people!
Pick it up!

03:53.200 --> 03:55.806
Turbo, ready to make his move.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.999
Did you see that?
She cut me off!

03:58.000 --> 04:01.004
Ah! The joys of racing.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.845
How could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.526
drive around in circles
for hours on end?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.688
Left turn!
Left turn! Left turn!

04:08.840 --> 04:10.683
Your ignorance
saddens me to no end.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.359
Left turn!
"What do I do here?"

04:12.360 --> 04:14.203
"Oh, no, wait a minute.
Left turn!"

04:14.680 --> 04:15.681
'Morning, Chet!

04:15.840 --> 04:16.841
How's it going, Sally?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.639
'Morning, Chet.
'Morning, Phil.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.564
Well, that's a shame.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.807
And so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.727
All right, people, we got a lot
of tomatoes to harvest today.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.163
We got to pick them, we got to
sort them, we got to eat them.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.164
But most importantly,
we got to be...

04:45.320 --> 04:46.321
Safe.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.051
Yes! Music to my ears.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.164
Look at her.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.599
Nice curves.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.208
Oh! You are one giant,
juicy temptress.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.041
Mmm. Big Red.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.489
Any day now.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.570
Any day now.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.686
Overripe!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.251
Overripe!

05:12.600 --> 05:13.806
Overripe!

05:17.960 --> 05:19.359
Oh, no.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.246
Here we go.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.246
Bring it on.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.962
Whoa! Not this time.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.399
And the cars are
at the starting line.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.970
Gagné's in
the top pole position,

05:48.160 --> 05:50.561
driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.087
Next to him is that feisty
young upstart, Turbo.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.403
Gentlemen, start your engines.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.445
Gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn

05:58.600 --> 06:01.001
with Turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.083
Hey, there he goes again.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.239
And down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!

06:06.240 --> 06:07.359
Go, Turbo!

06:07.360 --> 06:10.443
They're neck and neck!
Gagné, Turbo! Turbo, Gagné!

06:10.640 --> 06:14.042
- And it looks like the winner is...
- Turbo!

06:14.640 --> 06:15.919
Oh! So close!

06:15.920 --> 06:17.281
It's a photo finish!

06:21.960 --> 06:23.639
Overripe!

06:25.840 --> 06:28.207
All right, all right,
knock it off.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.890
Talk to your brother, Chet.
Or I will.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.166
I'm on it, Carl.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.924
This will not happen again.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.929
Uh-huh.
Heard that before.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.519
Okay.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.565
That's lunch!

06:58.800 --> 07:01.167
You do this to yourself,
you know.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.730
I mean, look at you.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.402
How could they
not make fun of you?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.722
It's like you're
almost forcing them.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.763
If you'd just quit
it with the speed stuff...

07:13.920 --> 07:15.126
I can't help it.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.721
It's in me.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.291
Mmm, no.
It is not "in" you.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.519
Says who?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.399
Nature. Mother Nature.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.447
Maybe you've heard of her?

07:23.600 --> 07:26.729
We all have
our limitations, Theo.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.359
And the sooner
you accept the dull,

07:29.360 --> 07:31.931
miserable reality
of your existence,

07:32.120 --> 07:34.282
the happier you'll be.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.441
Wow. Aren't you just a
little ray of sunshine?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.564
Heads up! Shell
crusher, two o' clock!

07:49.440 --> 07:51.442
All right, people,
you know the drill.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.090
Tuck and roll!

07:55.960 --> 07:58.531
Can't tuck.
I can't tuck!

08:02.760 --> 08:04.569
Theo, tuck and roll!

08:04.760 --> 08:06.519
We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.000
You have a shell
for a reason. Use it.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.491
You use it.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.563
I mean, come on, he's not
even looking this way.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.001
Hey, Juice Box, nice tricycle!

08:15.160 --> 08:16.241
You see what I'm saying?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.171
All right, good hustle.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.288
Good hustle, everybody!

08:25.480 --> 08:27.528
Almost everybody.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.607
Quitting time!

08:29.760 --> 08:30.761
Good night, Jim!
Night, Sally!

08:30.920 --> 08:32.399
Night, Steve!
I don't know your name.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.049
I'm out of here! Bye!

08:34.720 --> 08:36.245
<i>You're watching Fast!</i>

08:36.440 --> 08:39.205
<i>Sponsored by Adrenalode!</i>

08:39.360 --> 08:40.885
Adrenalode, not legal
in Utah and South Dakota.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.198
Do not exceed more than two cans
of Adrenalode in a 24-hour period.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.559
Do not expose Adrenalode to
flame, or to water, or to sand.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.686
Yes!

08:48.120 --> 08:50.441
Oh!
That tastes awesome.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.481
<i>Welcome back to</i>
The Road to Indianapolis.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.122
<i>I'm here with five-time Indy
champ, the legendary Guy Gagné!</i>

08:57.280 --> 08:58.399
I love you, Guy!

08:58.400 --> 09:00.639
<i>Tell us, Guy, do you have any advice
for the future racers out there</i>

09:00.640 --> 09:01.919
<i>who might be watching
at home right now?</i>

09:01.920 --> 09:03.410
Oh, my gosh.
That's me, that's me.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.001
<i>Well, there comes a time
in every race</i>

09:06.160 --> 09:10.722
<i>when a driver is forced to make that
one, key, split-second decision.</i>

09:10.880 --> 09:13.159
<i>Fall behind, or push ahead.</i>

09:13.160 --> 09:14.321
Push ahead!

09:14.480 --> 09:17.239
<i>To take a chance
and risk it all,</i>

09:17.240 --> 09:19.846
<i>or play it safe
and suffer defeat.</i>

09:20.000 --> 09:21.206
Risk it all, Guy!

09:21.360 --> 09:23.886
<i>But what really separates the
racers from the champions...</i>

09:24.000 --> 09:25.047
Yes!

09:25.240 --> 09:27.999
<i>...that one thing
that separates</i>

09:28.000 --> 09:29.923
<i>the ordinary from
the extraordinary...</i>

09:30.080 --> 09:31.286
What is it?

09:31.720 --> 09:34.371
<i>That one thing is...</i>

09:40.320 --> 09:41.367
No!

09:42.200 --> 09:43.247
No, you didn't!

09:43.520 --> 09:45.488
No! No! No! No! No!

09:45.640 --> 09:48.959
Come back to me, TV!

10:05.560 --> 10:07.164
Whoa.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.007
Only you have your finger on the...
It's working!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.399
'Morning, Bob.
'Morning, Sally.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.481
'Morning, Steve.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.721
'Morning...

10:21.440 --> 10:23.249
You know, this is good.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.481
Yes, this is good.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.001
I daresay we've had
a breakthrough, here.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.767
With that TV gone, you can
finally get out of that garage

10:30.920 --> 10:34.402
and put all that racing
nonsense behind you.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.721
And do what?

10:35.880 --> 10:37.484
Start living your life.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.879
I have a life?

10:41.320 --> 10:42.321
Big Red?

10:43.520 --> 10:44.726
Big Red!

10:45.640 --> 10:48.530
I can't tuck.
I can't tuck!

10:52.600 --> 10:53.931
Yes!
Finally!

10:54.240 --> 10:56.079
All right, let's chow down!

10:56.080 --> 10:58.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hit the brakes, people.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.444
It's Gardener Day.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.202
You're quitting?
Just like that?

11:10.360 --> 11:13.364
Hey, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.801
That's a bad thing.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.079
"There comes a time
in every race

11:25.080 --> 11:26.159

11:26.160 --> 11:28.811
that one, key,
split-second decision."

11:29.160 --> 11:30.286
What did he just say?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.599
"Take a chance and risk it all,

11:32.600 --> 11:35.080
or play it safe

11:35.240 --> 11:38.881
Okay, enough
with the crazy talk, Theo.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.964
Just step away from the
grass and get back to work.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.201
Theo!

11:43.480 --> 11:45.323
And the cars are
at the starting line.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.961
Gentlemen, start your engines.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.201
And once again,
it's Turbo out front.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.687
No dream is too big.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.728
In the high lane!
At the stripe!

12:24.880 --> 12:26.882
And it looks like
the winner is...

12:28.280 --> 12:30.851
Tuck and roll, Theo!
Tuck and roll!

12:36.480 --> 12:37.527
No!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.039
Aw.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.125
Are you insane?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.004
You could've
gotten yourself killed!

13:04.160 --> 13:05.924
Theo, what were you thinking?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.723
I thought I could get there.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.643
When are you gonna wake up?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.605
I wish...

14:46.560 --> 14:48.639
I wish I was...

15:24.960 --> 15:26.839
That was close.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.247
Oh, no.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.724
Yeah!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.441
No, no, no!
Come on! Faster!

16:37.080 --> 16:38.730
No, no, no!

17:18.200 --> 17:20.406
What happened?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.169
Hey, hey, hey!
Get out of here!

17:24.319 --> 17:26.971
Not dead! Not dead!

17:37.840 --> 17:39.808
Ugh! It reeks in here.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.521
It's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.330
Home.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.081
Aah! Aah!

18:05.400 --> 18:06.845
All right.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.600
I'm okay.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.839
Oh.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.410
That's peculiar.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.439
Okay, what's happening to me?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.284
Oh! What? That's me!

18:30.440 --> 18:32.719
Oh, come on! Stop it!

18:32.720 --> 18:35.405
Shh! Shh! Quiet, quiet!

18:35.560 --> 18:39.087
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

18:45.040 --> 18:47.719
Welcome, everyone, to this
monthly safety meeting.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.011
Well, there goes Jerry.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.762
I'm going to hand things
over to Chet, now,

18:54.920 --> 18:58.129
who has some important
new policies to go over.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.802
Thank you very much, Carl.
Good afternoon, everyone.

19:01.960 --> 19:06.879
I'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.848
Okay. I would like to begin
with some very exciting news.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.411
The latest figures are in.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.803
Accidental smushes
were down 15 percent.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.159
Well done, team.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.399
<i>It's tricky to rock a rhyme</i>

19:25.400 --> 19:27.399
<i>To rock a rhyme
That's right, on time</i>

19:27.400 --> 19:31.079
<i>It's tricky
T-t-tricky, tricky</i>

19:31.080 --> 19:33.319
<i>Yo, yo!
You're listening to 98.6</i>

19:33.320 --> 19:36.130
<i>where hip-hop... beats.</i>

19:42.280 --> 19:45.076
<i>What's new pussycat?</i>

19:45.077 --> 19:46.239
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

19:59.880 --> 20:01.365
<i>Drop it like it's hot</i>

20:01.366 --> 20:02.954
<i>Drop it like it's hot</i>

20:03.280 --> 20:05.726
Finally.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.639
Huh?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.609
What in the...

20:28.520 --> 20:29.521
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:33.640 --> 20:34.641
Oh!

21:09.600 --> 21:11.364
Whoa!

21:17.080 --> 21:18.889
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

21:20.080 --> 21:21.286
Help!

21:21.840 --> 21:24.161
Stop! Stop, stop!

21:24.880 --> 21:26.609
Mom!

21:27.960 --> 21:29.724
Yeah! Whoa!

21:32.680 --> 21:33.879
Oh, no!

21:33.880 --> 21:36.119
And so, in preparation
for Crow Awareness Week,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.249
I'd just like to say...

21:40.600 --> 21:42.559
Tuck and roll!

21:42.560 --> 21:45.679
No, I'm not kidding!
Tuck and roll!

21:47.320 --> 21:48.321
Look out!

21:56.040 --> 21:57.246
Granted, yes,

21:57.400 --> 22:03.043
I admit that there's been a wee
bit of damage to inventory, here,

22:03.200 --> 22:04.611
but if you'd just
let me explain...

22:04.800 --> 22:05.926
You're fired!

22:06.080 --> 22:09.323
Whoa, okay, Carl, if you just
give him one more chance,

22:09.480 --> 22:11.767
I promise that this
will never, ever...

22:11.920 --> 22:14.730
You don't understand.
You're fired.

22:14.880 --> 22:19.761
"You," plural. Youse.
Y'all. Both of you!

22:27.440 --> 22:30.683
Chet. I'm so sorry.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.444
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean for this to...

22:33.600 --> 22:35.887
All my life.

22:37.520 --> 22:41.286
All my life, I've defended
you, covered for you,

22:41.440 --> 22:44.279
stood up for you,
apologized for you,

22:44.280 --> 22:46.442
and this is what
I get in return.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.604
Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.407
A nice, comfy deck chair
on the <i>S.S. Theo!</i>

22:53.600 --> 22:55.279
Ave-aye, Captain!

22:55.280 --> 22:56.359
I'm really sorry.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.124
What is wrong with you?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.487
I don't know. All I
know is, the other night,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.881
I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...

23:03.040 --> 23:04.999
It was a rhetorical question!

23:06.120 --> 23:07.167
Chet!

23:07.280 --> 23:09.965
Help! The world is moving!

23:26.600 --> 23:27.647
Coming through!

23:32.440 --> 23:34.761
Okay, I'm gonna
wake up any minute now.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.160
Wake up! Wake up!

23:47.840 --> 23:49.365
Chet?

24:06.520 --> 24:09.444
Easy now, fellas. You
really don't wanna do this.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.166
Chet!

24:41.160 --> 24:45.927
Am I dead?
Is this heaven?

24:46.080 --> 24:48.242
I pictured it cleaner.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.731
Come on, get up.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.925
Theo. Whoa.
The crows got you, too.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.319
What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was...

24:58.880 --> 25:00.405
Look at this place.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.365
Broken glass, rusty nails.
Breathe.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.801
Discarded salt packets!
A few, yeah.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.167
It's like a minefield out here.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.325
Oh! Oh, no. I've got tetanus.
I've got tetanus.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.051
My jaw is locking up.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.440
Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.439
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

25:24.600 --> 25:29.003
Well, well, well. <i>Buenas noches,</i>
little <i>amigos.</i>

25:29.600 --> 25:31.807
This must be my lucky day.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.286
<i>Hola.</i> It's Tito.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.159
Hey, tell everyone
I'm bringing it.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.170
What is this place?

26:23.560 --> 26:24.607
Well, well, well.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.239
Somebody better call the cops,

26:26.240 --> 26:28.447
because I'm about to
make a killing.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.801
Killing?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.361
What'd he drag in this time?

26:33.160 --> 26:36.130
Ha! Whiplash is
going to eat them up.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.601
It's gonna be a slaughter.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.679
Mm-hmm, dead meat.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.530
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.123
Oh! Oh!

26:50.680 --> 26:51.920
Come on, come on.
Now, hurry up.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.367
A little far from home
aren't you, garden snail?

27:01.480 --> 27:05.166
Hey, I
think we got a crier here.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.285
Let's do this!

27:07.440 --> 27:09.759
I got this one!
Oh, I got this one!

27:09.760 --> 27:10.841
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

27:10.960 --> 27:11.961
Come on! This is me!

27:12.120 --> 27:13.849
Time to go, Theo.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.721
Ready...

27:17.360 --> 27:18.439
Set...

27:23.560 --> 27:24.639
Go!

27:35.920 --> 27:38.685
Look. He dead.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.564
Taco Man found dead snail.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.367
What?

28:16.200 --> 28:17.486
Run!

28:22.720 --> 28:24.324
Santa Maria!

28:24.680 --> 28:26.444
What did you say
your name was again?

28:26.680 --> 28:29.331
My name is Turbo.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.599
Aw! I wish I could
rename myself.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.759
Where did you find him?

28:32.760 --> 28:33.799
How did he do that?

28:33.800 --> 28:34.879
Where did you come from?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.689
Hey, how'd you do that?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.251
Theo. A word, please.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.524
Okay, that was...
Um...

28:40.680 --> 28:41.761
Amazing, right?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.919
If you think that's something,
check this out. Ooh!

28:43.920 --> 28:45.039
Ahhh! Turn it off!

28:45.040 --> 28:47.361
Sorry. High beams. Sorry.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.159
Ooh, that's a new one.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.323
It's okay, it's okay, Theo.
Just hang in there.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.847
As soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.168
What? I don't need to be fixed.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.367
There's nothing
wrong with me, Chet.

28:58.520 --> 29:02.127
Nothing wrong with you?
Well, you're...

29:02.280 --> 29:03.611
You're a freak of nature.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.564
I know, I know!
Isn't it great?

29:05.680 --> 29:06.719
Theo!

29:06.720 --> 29:08.688
You know what?
I prefer "Turbo."

29:10.120 --> 29:12.771
I don't know what crazy
lab you escaped from

29:12.920 --> 29:16.561
but you're amazing,
Little Amigo. Amazing!

29:16.720 --> 29:17.839
Tito!

29:17.840 --> 29:19.080
Mmm?

29:19.200 --> 29:20.964
Um, one second, please.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.090
Do you see that sign?
What does it say?

29:24.520 --> 29:25.559
Angelo...

29:25.560 --> 29:27.961
it says,
"Dos Bros Tacos."

29:28.160 --> 29:30.845
<i>"Dos"</i> Bros, Tito.
Not <i>"Uno"</i> Bro.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.651
You're supposed to be out
there, selling tacos,

29:33.800 --> 29:35.086
not racing snails.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.686
I know, but this little
guy is something special.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.086
I'm telling you, Angelo,

29:39.240 --> 29:42.130
the customers are gonna be
lining up around the block.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.884
I can see it already.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.967
"Come for the snail racing, stay
for the chimichangas." Huh?

29:49.680 --> 29:52.359
Get your head out
of the clouds, Tito.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.931
It's enough with
your crazy schemes.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.526
No! You're a taco
genius, Angelo.

29:57.680 --> 30:02.242
And it is my mission in life to
share your gift with the world.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.042
Great. Then first
thing in the morning,

30:05.240 --> 30:09.529
get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.404
Tito.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.246
You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?

30:22.400 --> 30:25.563
Here, I made up your bed.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.563
Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.171
So, I warmed up your blanket.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.326
There you go.
All comfy and cozy.

30:37.280 --> 30:41.285
Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.571
Did he really just
kiss you goodnight?

30:45.720 --> 30:47.643
He did. Jealous?

30:51.960 --> 30:54.122
Question. What gives
with the super-speed?

30:54.280 --> 30:55.645
Hey, hey, you a robot?

30:55.800 --> 30:57.006
Are you radioactive, homie?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.319
Is it contagious?

30:58.320 --> 31:00.448
Give the kid some space.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.082
I'm Whiplash. And
this here is my crew.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.811
I'm Skidmark!

31:09.240 --> 31:11.083
Ah. yeah!

31:11.240 --> 31:14.722
And I'm Burn.
Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.850
The name is Smoove Move. I set
the tone around here, you dig?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.411
Now check this.
Right about now,

31:19.600 --> 31:23.759
I'm moving so fast, the whole
world's going in slow motion, baby.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.125
Whoa...

31:25.640 --> 31:28.041
Here one second, gone the next.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.288
They call me the White Shadow!

31:30.440 --> 31:34.240
Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.161
I don't get it.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.007
I'm fast, like a shadow!

31:39.600 --> 31:42.604
Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.481
White Shadow...

31:45.640 --> 31:46.687
I can still see you.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.639
Listen, garden snail,
you clearly

31:48.640 --> 31:50.529
got the skills
to pay the bills.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.281
If snails had to
pay bills, that is.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.965
You would be able to pay them.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.610
Yeah, bills.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.171
Paid in full, son.

31:58.320 --> 32:02.039
So, I'm here to invite
you to join our crew.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.686
Join your crew?

32:05.400 --> 32:07.607
Did I say something humorous?

32:07.760 --> 32:10.650
I'm sorry. It's just that
you guys are, you know,

32:10.800 --> 32:13.239
kind of slow-ish.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.163
Oh! Really? To our faces?

32:15.320 --> 32:17.163
Theo, what are you doing?

32:17.320 --> 32:21.882
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.401
Heard what?
I didn't hear anything.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.289
Nothing out of order,
did you, Theo?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.519
Oh, I meant what I said.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.919
Then you better put your
money where your mouth is.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.285
Snails don't have money.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.284
Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?

32:34.440 --> 32:36.602
Your trash talk is
needlessly complicated.

32:36.760 --> 32:41.288
Is it? Or is it that your
unpaid bills are overdue?

32:41.480 --> 32:45.485
Enough talk.
It's time for action.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.490
It's simple. First one to the
top of that shooting star

32:51.080 --> 32:52.730
wins.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.043
You guys? Way up there, huh?
Awesome.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.239
Let me get my calendar
so I can time you.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.049
Oh, you got jokes, rookie?

33:00.200 --> 33:02.407
Laugh it up, garden snail.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.039
On your mark...

33:05.240 --> 33:07.004
Get yourself set...

33:07.160 --> 33:10.369
Prepare to be White Shadowed!

33:13.040 --> 33:14.087
Whoa!

33:15.920 --> 33:16.921
Yeah!

33:17.920 --> 33:19.079
Whoo!

33:19.080 --> 33:20.605
Yeah! Bam!

33:21.920 --> 33:23.079
Coming through!

33:23.080 --> 33:24.764
Oh! Those guys
are crazy!

33:24.920 --> 33:26.684
Those guys are awesome.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.006
Hey, player!
The party up here!

33:31.160 --> 33:32.321
Whoo!

33:37.680 --> 33:38.761
How do I get up there?

33:54.600 --> 33:55.886
Later!

33:56.800 --> 33:57.801
Oh!

34:10.760 --> 34:11.920
Coming through!

34:12.840 --> 34:13.920
Yeah!

34:15.360 --> 34:18.967
Who's "slow-ish" now, garden snail?

34:23.440 --> 34:26.284
Today, everything changes!

34:28.639 --> 34:30.960
Tito, what are you doing?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.009
Planning a "taco-volution"!

34:33.159 --> 34:36.846
It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words...

34:37.000 --> 34:39.764
"Taco" and "revolution."
I get it.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.491
But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?

34:42.679 --> 34:47.079
Patience, bro. Taco-volutions
don't happen in a day.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.199
<i>Tacos, I say</i>

34:48.199 --> 34:50.918
<i>Talking about a taco-volution</i>

34:50.920 --> 34:52.888
<i>Sauce and chips
Mmm.</i> ..

34:55.320 --> 34:57.759
<i>And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River.</i>

34:57.760 --> 34:58.959
Oh, Oh, Oh!

34:58.960 --> 35:00.610
<i>Famous for its appearance...</i>

35:03.960 --> 35:05.928
Get! Get out!

35:13.760 --> 35:17.845
Sorry, Paz. Can
you throw that up here?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.487
Coming to getcha!
I'm coming to getcha!

35:20.680 --> 35:21.681
Bye.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.719
Hey!

35:23.720 --> 35:26.371
Valley Hobby, this is
Bobby, how can I help you?

35:27.280 --> 35:30.727
No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.362
That's what I'm talking about!

35:34.560 --> 35:37.882
You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.884
Sure, knock yourself out.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.321
Can't get no better.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.040
Mmm!

36:27.840 --> 36:30.923
Okay. So,
what's your plan, huh?

36:31.120 --> 36:34.249
Stay here in this
rundown strip mall?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.762
With a bunch of lunatic snails,

36:36.960 --> 36:41.602
and a nutso taco man who is
using you to sell Mexican food?

36:41.800 --> 36:46.283
Because if that's your plan, then
whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!

36:46.440 --> 36:50.889
My ears are burning. I hope
you're not talking about me.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.450
You two seem to have a special
connection, Little Amigo,

36:54.600 --> 36:58.491
and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.839
Is this your mother?

36:59.840 --> 37:02.127
Your sister?

37:02.800 --> 37:06.964
Oh! Say no more.
It's your girlfriend.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.128
Ah, she's a cutie.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.561
Ow!

37:14.480 --> 37:15.481
Hmm.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.319
Women.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.170
I have to admit,

37:23.320 --> 37:26.767
I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.125
It doesn't make sense.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.760
With my brains and your speed,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.924
we should be destined
for greatness, right?

37:40.960 --> 37:42.962
We need to think big,
Little Amigo.

37:43.120 --> 37:47.205
I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.364
Flea markets. No, farmers' markets.
No, supermarkets.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.443
We'll cover all the markets.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.844
<i>Quinceañeras,</i>
confirmations, graduations.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.367
The Indy 500.

38:00.880 --> 38:04.407
Ooh, I got it. We can have
our very own <i>telenovela!</i>

38:04.560 --> 38:06.164
What? No.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.165
Oh...

38:20.520 --> 38:21.999
Whoo!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.924
This is it, Chet. I knew we
ended up here for a reason.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.969
Will you just
slow down for a second?

38:27.440 --> 38:31.240
Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!

38:31.400 --> 38:33.004
Theo, stop. Oh!

38:34.640 --> 38:36.529
What are you trying to say?

38:36.680 --> 38:39.081
I wanna enter him
in the Indy 500.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.891
The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?

38:42.040 --> 38:43.280
What is he talking about?

38:43.440 --> 38:46.046
Now, look, I know it may
sound a little crazy...

38:46.200 --> 38:48.771
No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.521
Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.324
What? People love sushi.

38:54.480 --> 38:59.281
Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.847
The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.561
Taco Man and his sidekick,
the Churro.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.959
Oh, that was
off-the-hook crazy!

39:07.960 --> 39:09.530
Crazy awesome.

39:09.680 --> 39:14.607
But this, Tito? This is in
a category all by itself.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.921
Angelo, please.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.122
Come on, Chet.
Just hear me out.

39:18.280 --> 39:22.080
Theo, a snail cannot race in a
competition meant for cars.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.685
There are rules.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.644
Actually, I've been doing
a lot of research,

39:25.840 --> 39:27.439
and there's
nothing in the rules

39:27.440 --> 39:28.960
that says a snail
can't enter the race.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.731
There's nothing that says this
sponge can't enter the race either,

39:31.880 --> 39:34.201
but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.567
Millions of people watch that race.
Uh-huh.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.370
This could put us
on the map, bro.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.959
Trying to work, here.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.291
Oh, come on, Angelo.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.959
All we have to do is raise the
$20,000 registration fee.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.079
What?

39:45.080 --> 39:47.048
I figured, once we sell the truck...
Sell the...

39:47.200 --> 39:49.521
Are you even listening
to yourself, Tito?

39:49.680 --> 39:54.846
You want to invest our entire
life savings in a snail!

39:55.000 --> 39:58.482
I'm telling you, this snail crawled
into our lives for a reason.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.210
I think he could be
our little shooting star.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.522
Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.682
That guy is as
crazy as you are.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.450
They'll never let
you into that race.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.126
And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.691
Yeah, but...
Angelo, listen...

40:12.840 --> 40:13.841
Tito!
Theo!

40:14.080 --> 40:16.606
Not every dream is
meant to come true.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.604
Yeah, what he said.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.089
A snail in the Indy 500.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.446
What will you think of next?

40:35.840 --> 40:39.439
Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow.

40:43.840 --> 40:44.841
Hmm.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.279
Now, I know some people may say

40:49.280 --> 40:51.408
$20,000 sounds
like a lot of money.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.721
It is a lot of money.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.089
And I know some people
may say I'm crazy.

40:56.240 --> 41:00.643
But I say, when a snail crawls into
your life at 200 miles an hour,

41:00.800 --> 41:03.406
then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,

41:03.600 --> 41:05.523
and take a ride of a lifetime.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.928
Now, in case you're
still not convinced...

41:09.080 --> 41:12.129
Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.

41:13.880 --> 41:18.010
<i>...are the
champions, my friends...</i>

41:20.440 --> 41:22.204
What's your point, Tito?

41:23.400 --> 41:26.961
My point is, we got a chance to
change our lives for the better.

41:27.120 --> 41:31.205
To make Starlight Plaza the great
place we all know it could be.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.407
Now, come on.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.009
Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?

41:41.200 --> 41:44.170
Sorry, Tito, but
I've got work to do.

41:44.880 --> 41:48.123
No, you don't.
None of you do.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.847
I don't get it.
That poster was awesome.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.080
Oh, well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.370
Oh, we're going
to Indianapolis, Chet.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.444
Don't you worry your chubby
little face about that.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.606
All right, team.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.009
Snail up!

42:12.480 --> 42:15.051
<i>And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River.</i>

42:15.200 --> 42:17.999
Famous for its appearance
in such movies as...

42:18.000 --> 42:19.959
You've just been
White Shadowed!

42:19.960 --> 42:21.644
Oh!
Whoo!

42:22.240 --> 42:24.279
Next stop is
the Starlight Plaza.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.641
Yes!

42:32.200 --> 42:34.282
Burn. Let's get
this party started.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.771
You know it.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.047
Snailed it.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.924
Skidmark. You bringing
the beverages?

42:42.240 --> 42:45.687
Oh, I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.644
Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby.

43:03.160 --> 43:06.050
Hey, Angelo!
We got customers.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.326
Whoa!

43:14.080 --> 43:15.730
Okay, you ready?

43:16.960 --> 43:18.159
Go!

43:21.960 --> 43:22.961
Huh?

43:26.200 --> 43:29.124
All right.
You're good to go.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.521
Okay, everybody.
Back on the bus.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.643
Oh, Mama, you look good!

43:33.840 --> 43:36.810
Bye. Come again. I do
weddings, bar mitzvahs.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.405
Thank you.
Come back soon.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.722
Tomorrow, later on today.
I'll be here.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.530
Good luck with
that snail of yours.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.165
Thank you, my friend.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.845
I gotta hand it to you, Tito.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.731
For once, one of your
crazy schemes worked.

43:48.840 --> 43:49.959
I know!

43:49.960 --> 43:52.327
And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,

43:52.520 --> 43:54.966
just imagine what
the Indy 500 could do.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.327
Hey, don't go crazy on me.

43:57.480 --> 44:00.927
We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.321
It's good enough.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.206
You better not mess this up, Tito.
Mmm-hmm.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.681
Oh, no.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.923
Oh, yes. We're going to
Indianapolis, Chet!

44:30.080 --> 44:34.639
"I" to the "N" to the "Dizzy"
to the "Wizzah." You dig?

44:34.640 --> 44:36.085
Yes, sir.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.924
One breakfast burrito, please.

44:44.760 --> 44:48.481
That's it. I'm sorry, honey.
Today is the day.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.124
Tito!

45:00.000 --> 45:01.001
Are you ready, big man?

45:01.160 --> 45:03.766
On three. One, two...

45:04.960 --> 45:07.645
Indy, baby!

45:27.480 --> 45:28.559
Oh, oh!

45:28.560 --> 45:30.767
I got it! "Fasty"!

45:30.920 --> 45:32.331
Are you kidding me?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.001
Huh?

45:37.480 --> 45:38.527
Oh!

45:38.760 --> 45:40.171
"Turbo"!

45:41.680 --> 45:45.446
All right, as the kids say,
"Time to plump your ride."

45:45.840 --> 45:47.683
Oh, heck, no!

45:49.800 --> 45:51.484
Let's do this.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.921
Now, that's more like it.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.879
No twitching. <i>Voilà!</i>

46:07.880 --> 46:09.319
Ooh-wee!

46:09.320 --> 46:12.244
Suited and booted, gooted and
looted, dipped and whipped!

46:12.400 --> 46:14.607
We've got a contender, baby!

46:22.680 --> 46:24.887
Oh, look at him go!

46:38.760 --> 46:39.879
Ah.

46:39.880 --> 46:40.881
Fresh air, baby.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.439
We ain't in Van Nuys no more.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.566
Uh-uh.

46:54.720 --> 46:55.767
Hi, Chet.

46:56.360 --> 46:57.805
You're gonna be my boyfriend!

46:58.360 --> 46:59.646
I'm gonna
call you "boo."

46:59.800 --> 47:02.371
"Boo"? What does
that even mean?

47:05.800 --> 47:08.599
Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?

47:10.920 --> 47:13.207
I can't believe
you're doing this.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.886
"We." We are doing this.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.566
You. I'm just a hostage.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.639
Theo, what happens
if you wake up tomorrow,

47:23.640 --> 47:26.325
and your powers are gone, hmm?

47:27.080 --> 47:29.367
What then?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.571
Then I better make
the most of today.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.571
This is even bigger
than Hobby-Con.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.726
Wow. Now,
that's a car.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.526
Whoa. Shiny.

48:56.840 --> 48:57.841
Gagné.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.531
Whoa!

49:21.040 --> 49:23.122
And Guy Gagné wins the pole,

49:23.280 --> 49:27.410
with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.762
That's Gagné's best time yet.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.003
Turbo has never gone that fast.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.491
I mean, yet.

49:33.640 --> 49:37.247
So, you got a plan, Taco Man?

49:37.400 --> 49:39.368
Of course I do.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.843
Please tell me those phony
glasses are not your plan.

49:44.080 --> 49:47.527
Uh, no.
That would be ridiculous.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.087
Come on, phony
glasses, do your thing.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.964
Oh, this great. I'm gonna
go have heart attack.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.210
<i>Qué pasa,</i> my friend?

50:07.880 --> 50:11.043
I have a driver that I'd
like to enter into the race.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.123
What team does
your driver race for?

50:13.320 --> 50:15.926
Dos Bros Tacos and Company.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.769
Has he passed the rookie test?

50:21.600 --> 50:24.490
Hey, come here. Let's
cut to the chase, okay?

50:24.640 --> 50:27.371
You have glasses,
I have glasses.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.602
What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?

50:29.760 --> 50:32.366
Hey, let go.
Come on, man, let go!

50:32.520 --> 50:36.320
This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.479
Yeah, yeah.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.439
Guy, how do you do it,

50:44.440 --> 50:46.959
shattering your own
records year after year?

50:46.960 --> 50:50.681
Well, when a cheetah
chases after a gazelle,

50:50.840 --> 50:54.208
does he ever stop to think, "Maybe
I've caught enough gazelles.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.324
"Maybe I should just settle
down, try the vegan thing."

50:57.480 --> 51:00.723
No! He keeps running as long
as his legs will carry him.

51:00.880 --> 51:04.407
I am like the cheetah.
I never give up.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.559
Next question.

51:08.200 --> 51:12.000
All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.926
Whoa!
What gives?

51:19.480 --> 51:20.720
No, no, no!

51:23.960 --> 51:25.883
Can I help you, monsieur?

51:26.560 --> 51:28.244
One second, please.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.641
What are you doing? Are you
trying to get me arrested?

51:35.400 --> 51:36.479
Oh.

51:36.480 --> 51:39.768
Sorry! So sorry. We'll
have this under control...

51:39.920 --> 51:41.604
Ladies and gentlemen!

51:41.760 --> 51:46.402
I give you the next
Indy 500 champion!

51:46.840 --> 51:48.330
Huh? Huh?

51:48.800 --> 51:51.770
Is that a snail?

51:52.000 --> 51:55.447
Your driver is a snail?

52:02.440 --> 52:04.283
What kind of welcome is that?

52:04.440 --> 52:07.649
I'd say an appropriate
welcome, given the situation.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.245
All right.
Game over, nut job.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.599
Let's go.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.568
Have a nice flight, Chet.
Huh?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.290
Hit it!
White Shadow!

52:15.680 --> 52:17.011
<i>Bonzai!</i>

52:17.840 --> 52:18.919
Get off!

52:18.920 --> 52:20.160
Pedal to the metal, Turbo.

52:21.880 --> 52:22.961
Go!

52:25.400 --> 52:26.606
Whoa!

52:40.560 --> 52:41.641
Yeah!

52:42.240 --> 52:44.766
Whoa! That snail is fast!

53:07.000 --> 53:08.439
Whoo!

53:08.440 --> 53:10.169
What did I miss?
What did I miss?

53:14.920 --> 53:18.766
226! Ha-ha! That's fast
enough to qualify!

53:23.320 --> 53:25.687
That's what I'm talking about!

53:28.960 --> 53:32.319
<i>Whoa!
That snail is fast!</i>

53:32.320 --> 53:35.290
Oh, man, wait until
people see this!

53:38.960 --> 53:43.488
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!
What? Are you seeing this?</i>

53:45.600 --> 53:47.568
- Hello?
<i>- Have you heard?</i>

53:47.720 --> 53:49.165
Yes, I've heard.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.890
<i>That snail is fast.</i>

53:51.080 --> 53:53.731
Forget about it. This
will blow over by noon.

53:53.880 --> 53:56.359
<i>Whoa!
That snail is fast!</i>

53:57.920 --> 53:59.126
- Hello?
<i>- Have you seen it?</i>

53:59.280 --> 54:01.169
Yes, I've seen it!

54:04.760 --> 54:07.127
<i>Whoa!
That snail is fast!</i>

54:07.280 --> 54:08.361
<i>What?</i>

54:09.160 --> 54:11.162
<i>Snail is fast!</i>

54:11.320 --> 54:12.799
<i>You see the snail moving fast</i>

54:12.800 --> 54:14.165
<i>You slow, you gonna get passed</i>

54:14.320 --> 54:16.004
<i>You see him
gaining position for first</i>

54:16.160 --> 54:17.161
<i>He won't be last</i>

54:17.320 --> 54:18.845
<i>He's ready to make a dash</i>

54:19.000 --> 54:20.604
<i>Snail quicker
than a lightning flash</i>

54:20.760 --> 54:22.199
<i>His engine's roaring,
he's flooring</i>

54:22.200 --> 54:23.599
<i>He won't run out of gas</i>

54:24.680 --> 54:26.330
<i>Whoa!
That snail is fast!</i>

54:26.480 --> 54:29.370
<i>That snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

54:30.480 --> 54:32.687
Whoa! Are you
seeing this?

54:32.840 --> 54:33.959
Whoa!

54:33.960 --> 54:36.281
<i>You cannot have
a snail in the Indy 500.</i>

54:36.440 --> 54:38.329
<i>Whoa!
It's a miracle of nature!</i>

54:38.480 --> 54:40.801
<i>Will the snail
be crushed by the giant race cars?</i>

54:41.000 --> 54:42.279
Whoa!

54:42.280 --> 54:44.069
<i>That snail is fast,</i>

54:44.070 --> 54:45.832
<i>Fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

54:49.720 --> 54:52.530
Whoa. That snail is fast.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.079
We've just received
word that the CEO

54:57.080 --> 54:59.003
of IndyCar is about
to make a statement.

55:07.120 --> 55:10.010
And so, after careful
consideration and...

55:10.240 --> 55:11.750
<i>That snail is fast</i>

55:11.751 --> 55:13.235
<i>That snail is fast</i>

55:13.360 --> 55:15.044
Sorry. My bad.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.605
I've decided...

55:18.760 --> 55:20.091
Please, say yes.
Please, say yes.

55:20.240 --> 55:21.651
Please, say no.
Please, say no.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.689
White Shadow.

55:25.120 --> 55:29.489
I've decided that I simply cannot
permit a snail to enter...

55:29.680 --> 55:32.079
Please, sir,
give my snail a shot,

55:32.080 --> 55:34.321
and I swear,
you won't regret it.

55:34.960 --> 55:39.568
Mr. Lopez, while I appreciate your
enthusiasm, my decision is...

55:39.720 --> 55:41.085
Let him race!

55:41.240 --> 55:42.605
Let him race!

55:42.760 --> 55:44.000
Let him race!

55:44.160 --> 55:47.289
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

55:49.440 --> 55:51.966
Now, now. Order.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.571
Sir, if I may.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.927
You might want to
get a two-shot here.

55:56.120 --> 56:01.729
I, like this passionate gentleman
here, came from humble beginnings.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.730
In the words of my dear father,

56:04.920 --> 56:10.370
"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small."

56:11.000 --> 56:12.889
And that is why I, for one,

56:13.040 --> 56:17.364
believe that if the Indy 500 isn't
going to put a limit on speed,

56:17.560 --> 56:21.121
then it shouldn't
put a limit on spirit!

56:22.280 --> 56:24.248
Give the people what they want.

56:24.440 --> 56:26.010
Let him race!

56:26.160 --> 56:30.768
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

56:30.920 --> 56:32.251
Just me.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.051
Whole frame, my face.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.766
All right!

56:40.920 --> 56:42.763
"All right," what?

56:43.400 --> 56:47.291
Your snail can compete
in the Indianapolis 500.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.481
Yeah!

56:50.800 --> 56:54.043
Has the world lost its mind?

57:03.840 --> 57:04.999
To Turbo!

57:05.000 --> 57:07.082
Starlight Plaza! Hey!

57:07.240 --> 57:08.605
He ain't slow no more.

57:08.760 --> 57:09.839
That's for sure.

57:09.840 --> 57:10.959
Shut the door.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.724
Get on the floor.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.723
Barbeque sauce!

57:16.040 --> 57:17.804
<i>And we're back
with more from Indianapolis.</i>

57:17.960 --> 57:19.689
Check it out.
We're on TV.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.519
<i>Mr. Lopez,
how do you feel about</i>

57:21.520 --> 57:23.090
<i>getting to compete
in the Indy 500?</i>

57:23.240 --> 57:25.322
<i>I'm just so happy.</i>

57:25.480 --> 57:27.399
<i>And we'd all be
happy to see you</i>

57:27.400 --> 57:29.243
<i>come on down to
the Starlight Plaza.</i>

57:29.400 --> 57:32.449
<i>Just north of the 101
in Van Nuys, California.</i>

57:32.600 --> 57:36.366
<i>Kim Ly Nail Salon. Where we
put the "nail" in "snail. "</i>

57:37.360 --> 57:40.603
Taco Man cried in front of
millions of people. Ow!

58:02.600 --> 58:04.648
Here you go, Paz.
Nice and warm.

58:04.800 --> 58:05.847
Goodnight, Tito.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.644
You comfy enough, Bobby?
Uh... No.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.325
Okay, let me know
if you need anything.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.403
Hey! No touching!

58:14.080 --> 58:16.003
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

58:16.920 --> 58:21.323
Sleep tight, Little Amigo.
We got a big day tomorrow.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.290
Yep.

58:25.080 --> 58:27.242
Big day, indeed.

58:27.360 --> 58:30.443
Hmm, I'm detecting a refreshing
note of disapproval.

58:30.600 --> 58:33.649
I'm worried.
And you should be, too.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.079
I'll be fine.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.439
You are delusional,
you know that?

58:38.440 --> 58:41.125
It's Big Red all over again.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.967
Only this time, instead
of one lawn mower,

58:44.160 --> 58:48.609
it'll be 32 giant,
fire-breathing cars!

58:49.600 --> 58:51.489
And I won't be
able to save you.

58:51.640 --> 58:55.008
You won't have to, because
this time, I have speed.

58:55.160 --> 58:58.289
You're not a car.
You're a snail.

58:58.880 --> 59:03.010
I got a shot here, Chet.
I can do this. You'll see.

59:03.160 --> 59:04.571
No, I won't.

59:04.960 --> 59:08.885
I will not stand by and watch
the only brother I've got

59:09.040 --> 59:13.364
risk his life chasing
some impossible dream.

59:13.960 --> 59:15.689
I'm sorry, Theo.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.800
All of these people,
they believe in me.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.603
Guy Gagne believes in me.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.248
Why won't you?

59:28.400 --> 59:32.166
And by the way,
my name is Turbo.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.407
All right.
<i>Tout suite</i>, let's go.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.681
Whoa.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.484
2.2-liter turbo V6.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.611
24-valve
quad-overhead cam.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.399
Fastest open-wheel, single-seat
machine on the planet.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.210
I think I'm in love.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.724
No way.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.410
You're not trying to steal
my trophy from me, are you?

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.610
Because if you want one for
yourself, you may have a long wait.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.841
Espresso?

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.044
So, you are my
little competition, eh?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.567
The underdog
versus the champion.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.803
The world loves the
underdogs, you know.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.850
The dreamers out there,
they need them.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.399
Need to believe
that one day, maybe

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.687
they could achieve
the impossible, too.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.008
Well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.925
And dreamers?

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.129
Let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.331
I've never talked to a snail before.
So small, so amusing.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.801
No wonder they want
to see you race, eh?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.526
Vroom! Vroom!

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.523
Look at him go.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.489
Thank you, plucky snail.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.487
Because of you, the whole world
will be watching this race.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.891
And when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.761
Crawl home, garden snail,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.802
while you still can.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.043
<i>Good afternoon, race fans,</i>

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.484

<i>Where were you the day they let
a snail race in the Indy 500?</i>

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.968
Okay, time to go.
You ready?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.681
All right, team meeting.
Bring it in.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.164
This is it, Little Amigo.
This is our moment. Our time.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.846
Today is the day
we make our mark.

Everybody in!
It's go time!

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.644
Oh, Theo.
Be careful out there.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.722
Hey, little snail.
Are you lost?

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.959
No.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.279
Are you a boy, or a girl?

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.682
Why is this confusing?
I'm not a girl!

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.926

the biggest names in motorsport.

got the best seat in the house.

Oh, no. Nope.
This isn't happening.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.685
I gotta get out of here.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.009
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.439
Help! Let me out.
Let me out!

Easy to the peasy, baby.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.250
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
We can do this, right?

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.721
Oh, I wish I was tiny,
so I can give you a hug.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.881
Get off the track!

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.641
Okay, okay, I'm going!
Good luck out there, Turbo!

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.009
Did anybody bring earplugs?

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.207
What?

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.528
Oh, I can't watch this.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.411
The pace car is off and the
parade laps are underway.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.399
<i>Only moments until
the green flag drops,</i>

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.768
<i>and history is made
here at Indianapolis.</i>

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.325
Let's do this.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.409
<i>And the race is on!</i>

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.604
You go, Turbo!

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.889
<i>Turbo, struggling out there.</i>

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.089
Looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.725
He's getting killed out there.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.167
What have we done?

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.928
Whoa.
That snail is history.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.487
Oh! I think
I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.250
Come on, garden snail.
Get your head in the game!

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.969
Go, go, go!

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.406
All right, go, go, go!

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.359
Come on! We're supposed
to be a team, here!

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.479
We're trying.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.563
It's a snail. There's
not that much to do.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.526
That's it. This pit crew is
officially under new management.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.081
Now, this is how it's done.
Air jack.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.844
Jack-tivate.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.359
Lube.
Applied liberally.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.407
Detailing.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.045
Wax on, wax off.
Ow!

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.599
Fuel!
Down the hatch.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.759
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.879
Foot massage.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.599
You know it.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.090
Relaxing vibes.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.442
Own it, brother.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.001
Now, de-lax those vibes!

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.366
Ahhh! Are you crazy?

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.846
Ow! Yeah, I'm crazy! What
made you think I was sane?

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.679
I don't
know how to... Ow!

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.045
Are you a car?
No.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.759
Are you a car?

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.841
No!

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.281
Then stop driving like one!

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.801
Now get out there.
Snail up, baby!

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.999
Go, T-boogie, go!

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.889
Gagné with
a commanding lead now.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.647
Followed by Claudio Cruz,
Shelby Stone and Takao Noguchi.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.127
Go!
Come on.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.450
Snail up.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.005
Snail up!

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.521
Yes!

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.399
I don't believe it!
Turbo just went under a car!

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.368
Whoa!
Did you see that?

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.127
<i>Despite a rocky start, it
looks like Turbo is gaining some ground.</i>

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.482
Yeah! Now we're talking!

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.085
Where is he?
Where is he?

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.569
Oh! He passed another one!

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.966
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.604
That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.402
Go, go, go!
Left turn! Left turn!

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.847
Yeah! Left turn!

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.087
<i>Turbo maneuvers past
Shelby Stone and into second place!</i>

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.208
He is hot on Gagné's heels!

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.249
The snail's not
going away, Guy.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.971
All right, I know, I know!

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.080
<i>These racers better
watch it coming into turn four.</i>

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.244
This late in the race, that
outside edge is full of marbles.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.801
And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.719
That rubber
peeling off the tires

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.688
can be a minefield
for these drivers.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.005
Here we go.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.881
Whoa!

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.927
Turbo!

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.006
Oh, no.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.525
Oh, man.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.644
What are we gonna do? If he takes
another hit like that last one...

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.724
You gotta pull him, Tito.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.885
I'm sorry, Little Amigo.
It's over.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.007
Hey.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.126
We got this far.
It's good enough.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.844
No, it's not.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.319
<i>With the green
flag about to be waved,</i>

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.322
<i>it looks like a mere
formality at this point.</i>

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.768
<i>Gagné, just five laps
away from victory.</i>

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.322
Wait a minute! Turbo is
still in this thing!

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.761
Huh?

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.479
What?

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.399
Whoa!
What happened there?

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.319
Come on, come on!

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.321
Whoa!

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.207
No!

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.322
Theo!

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.170
No!

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.126
- Not this time.
- Come on!

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.045
Come on, Turbo.
Come on, Turbo.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.489
Come on, just hold in
there a little longer.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.287
No!

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.999
No!

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.890
Farewell, little snail.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.479
<i>Unbelievable!
Turbo takes the lead.</i>

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.244
Snail-style, baby!

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.479
Bad idea. Bad idea.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.449
And the white flag is in the air as
we enter the 200th and final lap.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.801
<i>Turbo weaving between
lapped cars like a snail possessed.</i>

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.606
<i>He is determined to
hold onto his lead.</i>

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.767
No!

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.966
I will not lose to a snail!

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.124
Gagné is in the marbles!

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.605
Guy, what are you doing?

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.121
Oh!

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.641
Ah...

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.327
Theo!

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.806
Turbo!

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.489
<i>The track is backed up
all the way down the front straight.</i>

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.689
<i>It's complete
gridlock down there.</i>

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.047
I can't see him.
I can't see him.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.850
Guy, are you okay?

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.045
Where am I?

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.959
There he is.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.999
Theo.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.684
Let's finish this.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.611
Oh, no.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.884
Oh...
Turbo.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.409
No, no, no. Theo, what are you doing?
Don't give up.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.886
Oh!

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.799
Oh!

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.087
Hey! Where are you going?

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.359
No, no!

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.283
Get back here! No, wait!

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.764
No! Little snail!

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.160
Theo!

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.091
Is that Chet?

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.007
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.441
Ugh!

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.487
Salt!

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.447
Crows?
Are you kidding me?

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.841
Long time no see, Chet!

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.890
Hey!
Don't test me, crow.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.601
White Shadow!

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.479
Nice moves back there, boo.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.442
Is this really necessary?

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.119
No, man.
But it's fun.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.360
Whoo!

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.727
Theo!

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.206
Theo!

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.319
Chet?

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.685
Finish this!

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.286
I can't.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.647
Oh, yes, you can.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.365
You're right, you know.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:09.411
It is in you.
It's always been in you.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.402
Now, I did not just face every
fear known to snail-kind

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.127
to come down here and watch
you hide in your shell.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.279
I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.608
Don't even think about it.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.689
And my little brother
never gives up.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.924
That's the best
thing about you.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.162
So, you get out there
and you win this...

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.360
Turbo.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.525
He's still going.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.168
Son of a gun.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.605
Come on, come on!

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.769
Unbelievable!
The race is back on!

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.483
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.080
Little Amigo!

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.729
Hey, snail! He's gradually
gaining on you!

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.051
Come on! Come on!

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.600
Turbo! Tuck and roll!

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.480
And Turbo wins it by a shell!

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.005
That's what I'm talking about!

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.563
Chet! Chet!

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.087
Turbo!

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.361
Chet!

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.768
We won, right?
We just won?

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.724
We won.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:26.370
Hey, everybody! My brother
won the Indy 5,000!

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.967
Wow. That's so romantic.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.571
<i>Hey, Angelo. We did it!</i>

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.003
We did it. We did it!

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.369
Free tacos for everybody!

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.364
Snail power, baby!

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.119
Um...

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.121
Mom.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.245
Hey, Gagné! Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.209
You big bad boy!
Security!

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.243
I step on you!
Do you like that?

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.600
Sleeper hold!
All right.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.411
Let go of me!
I'm just an old lady!

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.245
Kim Ly Nail Salon!

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.242
That's our snail!

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.087
It's like I always said,
Little Amigo, you are amazing!

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.526
Okay, wait.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.722
Just keep your eyes closed
until I say so, okay?

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.087
Tito, this is stupid.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.321
Ta-da!

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.162
<i>Hello, Angelo.
Let's get cooking.</i>

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.519
Boom!

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.001
The stove talks, bro.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.284
Uh-uh. Mmm-mmm. No, honey, soonest
available three months from now, 6:00 AM.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.205
Brenda, that daisy really
brings out your foot!

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.761
Hey, I'm not paying you guys
to sit around and look pretty.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.284
Now, that's more like it.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.759
Check it out.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.959
