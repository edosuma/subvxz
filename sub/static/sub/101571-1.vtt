00:47.965 --> 00:49.133
My darling.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.594
No. Don't come near me.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.471
I'm asking you nicely.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.347
Come with me!

00:55.431 --> 00:56.974
Stop fighting me!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.422
Hello.

01:28.506 --> 01:31.008
<i>Hello?</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:32.927
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:35.304
It's 7:00 in the morning, Ma.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.847
Fine.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.432
I'll call you later.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.642
No, it's okay.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.644
What's up?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.355
Shobha Aunty just called.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.733
Abhishek got engaged.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.943
Mm-hmm.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.486
Did you hear what I said?

01:50.569 --> 01:52.488
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.241
Your youngest cousin
just got engaged.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.534
You're the only one left.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.911
Oh, what a shame.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.871
I should never
have left America.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.873
<i>I should have only
come back to India</i>

02:02.957 --> 02:04.875
<i>after finding you a husband.</i>

02:04.959 --> 02:07.211
- Uh-huh.
- What "uh-huh"?

02:09.964 --> 02:12.591
Just let me be, Ma.
I'm okay.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.802
I'm not cursed.
I keep telling you.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.262
How can you say that?

02:16.345 --> 02:17.888
You're turning 29 soon.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.474
Yeah, last year of my 20s.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.351
No. You know
what your horoscope says.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.270
If you're not married by 29,

02:24.353 --> 02:26.730
then you won't be married
at all.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.650
Won't get married at all...
What a tragedy.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.361
Tell Pallavi what you think.

02:33.946 --> 02:38.158
Astrology is
unscientific nonsense.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.120
Love you.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.830
You're both gonna
torture me to death.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.916
A good marriage
doesn't happen just like that.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.128
You have to take this seriously,
okay, Pallu?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.213
If you're not careful...

02:53.215 --> 02:54.800
...bad things could happen.

02:54.884 --> 02:58.095
Ma, why do you
always assume the worst?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.349
Ma? Hello?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.232
I'm your mother, no?
That's my job.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.568
Are you wearing your bracelet?

03:12.651 --> 03:14.278
Yes, I am wearing it.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.988
Good. It will protect you

03:16.071 --> 03:17.907
from the evil eye, darling.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.325
Good. I love it.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.993
Can I go back to sleep now?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.328
Yes, yes.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.705
Sorry. Take rest.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.915
Okay, sure.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.875
- Talk to you soon.
- Bye.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.203
<i>I can't believe
you're gonna be a mom.</i>

05:28.287 --> 05:30.039
<i>I feel like one already.</i>

05:30.122 --> 05:31.915
I'm so in love
with this little goblin.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.167
I'd do anything for her.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.128
Can I help with anything, Malik?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.337
- Nah, I got it.
- Good,

05:37.421 --> 05:39.181
- 'cause I don't know how to make chai.
- Oh.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.874
It's like she heard me
articulate my failings as

05:43.886 --> 05:46.366
- an Indian woman.
- You want me to teach you how to make chai?

05:47.222 --> 05:49.308
- Hi, Ma.
- Hello, darling.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.893
What's that music?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.478
Oh, you wouldn't know it.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.271
I like it.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.273
Look who I'm with.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.357
Hello, Kelly.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.734
You look so beautiful.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.611
Aw, thanks, Mrs. Khatri.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.904
Where's Malik?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.655
Oh, he's in the kitchen
making chai.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.991
- Hi, Mrs. Khatri.
- Sweet boy.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.993
Even Pallavi doesn't know
how to make tea.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.497
What's up, Ma?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.707
So, Pallu, okay, I wanted to...

06:13.791 --> 06:14.917
No.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.585
I'm not meeting another boy.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.504
That is not why I called.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.506
Uh-huh. Sure.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.717
Well, since I've got you
on the phone...

06:23.801 --> 06:26.512
Look, darling.
He looks handsome, no?

06:28.597 --> 06:29.932
Oh, yeah,
he's very professional.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.600
See? Kelly also likes him.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.852
He lives in Houston,
but he's going to New Orleans

06:33.936 --> 06:36.230
this weekend,
and he said he could meet you.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.673
Wait, you've already
arranged this?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.066
We have to move fast.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.442
He doesn't even live here.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.736
There are no Indians
in New Orleans.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.580
- What am I supposed to do?
- Ma.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.866
Okay, we talked about this.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.284
I can't do these setups anymore.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.954
I'm not saying marry him.
I'm just saying go for coffee.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.455
What are we saying?

06:53.539 --> 06:54.694
I'm trying to talk
to your daughter.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.958
What is she saying?

06:56.041 --> 06:58.502
Oh, trying to find Pallavi
a man who can make chai.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.129
Amma, these things
never work out.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.797
But what if it does this time

07:01.880 --> 07:04.758
and then you say no
without even trying?

07:04.842 --> 07:07.594
How's the chai?
It's not too hot, is it?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.227
Fine.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.896
The things I do for you.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.275
So, what'd your mom say
about this one?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.901
Engineer...

07:22.985 --> 07:24.505
- Mm-hmm.
- ...hikes on the weekends...

07:24.570 --> 07:27.531
- Mm.
- ...likes music.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.491
- Likes music?
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.160
Oh.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.996
Okay.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.497
- Is he in there?
- Oh, yeah.

07:35.581 --> 07:38.208
How bad is it?

07:38.292 --> 07:40.335
- Oh, shit.
- Great.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.921
He's hot.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.756
What?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.221
- That's not him.
- Mm. It should be.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.265
It could be.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.934
Hey, just... go with it.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.477
Honest mistake.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.217
All brown dudes look alike.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.856
Right?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.568
Oh, come on.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.596
Hey.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.847
Have we met?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.726
Wow. Use that line a lot?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.145
Uh, sorry.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.688
Uh...

08:42.773 --> 08:45.359
you are waiting on a setup,
aren't you?

08:45.442 --> 08:46.735
What?

08:46.818 --> 08:48.138
You've been
looking out the window

08:48.153 --> 08:50.822
for a while now,
waiting for someone.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.700
But if it was a regular date,
you might have bailed by now.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.702
So I'm guessing
you probably have to report

08:55.786 --> 08:58.372
back to your parents,
so you're sticking around.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.207
Is that right?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.918
God, setups are
the absolute worst, aren't they?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.169
Yeah.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.462
Yeah.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
Anyway, I didn't mean to...

09:07.965 --> 09:09.841
- No. Yeah.
- Sorry. Yeah.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.177
Take care.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.303
Well, I mean...

09:15.055 --> 09:17.224
...he's not here yet.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.559
No, he's not.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.232
I'm Sandeep.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.942
Pallavi.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.860
Beautiful name.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.946
Thank you.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.787
Hey, sorry.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.747
Was there an Indian girl
waiting here?

09:40.831 --> 09:41.999
Oh, yeah.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.084
Uh, she left a few minutes ago.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.086
<i>He was over an hour late, Ma.</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:47.629
Of course I left.

09:47.713 --> 09:48.880
Just like that?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.215
Where are you now?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.011
- With Sonia.
- You can see Sonia anytime.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.762
How can you do this, Pallu?

09:55.846 --> 09:57.973
He's a decent boy
from a good family.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.183
I didn't even want to meet him
in the first place.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.601
It doesn't matter.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.020
How does it not matter?

10:03.103 --> 10:06.148
'Cause we are doing this for
your happiness, for your future.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.066
When your commander says
drop to the ground,

10:08.150 --> 10:09.484
you drop to the ground.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.516
Ma, this is not the army.
You are not my commander.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.989
I don't have to
blindly obey you.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.285
I'm asking you to trust me.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.078
Why can't you just...

10:20.162 --> 10:21.872
Why can't I meet someone
on my own?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.165
Ma?

10:28.587 --> 10:29.587
Hello?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.009
- Hello?
- Yes.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.510
Yes.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.432
Of course you can
meet someone yourself.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.476
I just don't want you to...

10:42.559 --> 10:44.186
fall in love with the wrong man.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.645
You want me to trust you,

10:45.729 --> 10:47.606
but you don't trust me at all,
do you?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.566
- Pallavi...
- I'll talk to you later, okay?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.659
You okay?

10:59.743 --> 11:01.161
Yeah.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.247
My mom... she's a bit much.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.044
Sorry.

11:09.127 --> 11:13.298
This was us at a wedding
a few years back in Edison.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.509
Before my parents
moved back to Delhi.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.011
My dad got this
great university gig,

11:18.095 --> 11:21.723
and it just made sense
for them to go back home.

11:21.807 --> 11:25.060
Must be hard, being so far away.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.145
I don't see my parents much,
either.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.529
Listen, um, this was
really fun, but I got to...

11:35.612 --> 11:37.447
Have another setup to get to?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.865
Yeah, who knows?

11:38.949 --> 11:41.284
Maybe that guy's still waiting
for me at the coffee shop.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.413
Can I see you again?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.833
Maybe.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.552
You go ahead.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.518
Almost one month now, you've
been having these migraines.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.479
So... so, please,
let me stay and help you.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.731
No. If I'm alone,

12:11.815 --> 12:13.150
It passes.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.234
Are you sure?

12:14.317 --> 12:15.652
It's okay.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.155
Go. Go, go. I'll be fine.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.411
I'm getting worried.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.121
What am I supposed to say
to everyone?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.873
I'll bring some sweets.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.224
Can you believe it?
They met over Skype a month ago,

12:46.308 --> 12:48.226
and the wedding got decided
then and there.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.352
Ugh. I don't understand.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.758
You know,
these youngsters so modern.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.689
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.970
<i>Arre,</i> woman,
today's my cheat day.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.108
Hey, where's Usha? Huh?

12:55.192 --> 12:56.512
I've been looking for her
all day.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.445
She fell ill
just before we were coming,

12:58.528 --> 13:00.614
and so she'll visit
the family another time.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.824
Oh. Is she still obsessed
with the evil eye?

13:02.908 --> 13:04.951
- Yeah.
- Pallavi's not cursed. That's silly.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.412
Oh, take her
to see a doctor, nah?

13:07.496 --> 13:10.081
Take her to see my doctor.
He prescribes everything.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.791
- She'll be fine.
- Mm.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.128
Oh. I say don't take anything,
you take a whole plate.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.572
- I will die tomorrow.
- Excuse me.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.952
- Let me eat today.
- Is it opposite day?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.364
Let me eat today.
I'll die tomorrow.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.593
- Oh, today? Today?
- I'll die tomorrow. Come on.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.079
Hello?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.872
<i>Hi, Ma.</i>

13:50.956 --> 13:52.791
- You okay?
- Yes.

13:52.874 --> 13:53.917
Yes, of course.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.795
- Wait, did I just wake you up?
- No, no.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.463
I was just lying down.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.383
Ma, isn't it Abhishek's
engagement tonight?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.885
Are you that upset that
you skipped the engagement?

14:03.969 --> 14:05.720
Anyway,

14:05.804 --> 14:08.974
um... I've met someone.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.350
You met someone?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.394
What does that mean?
Do you have a boyfriend?

14:12.477 --> 14:13.895
Well, we've been
seeing each other

14:13.979 --> 14:16.565
for three or four weeks now.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.275
Do you like him?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.486
I wouldn't tell you about him
if I didn't like him.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.113
What's his name?

14:23.196 --> 14:26.616
Okay, don't get too excited.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.618
His name is Sandeep Patel.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.329
What, Indian? A Gujarati?

14:31.413 --> 14:33.873
Those Patel types are very rich.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.947
- Please don't say things like that.
- How old is he?

14:35.959 --> 14:38.253
- What does he do?
- He's my age.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.629
He works in tech.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.381
He's very successful.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.884
Pallu, this is such good news.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.553
- Really?
- Yes.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.472
I've been praying
for a good man for you.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.850
He's a good man, yes?

14:51.933 --> 14:53.476
- Yeah, I mean, sure.
- Sure?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.270
You have to be positive.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.801
You have to know
what kind of person he is.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.148
Send me his parents' info.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.649
- I'll talk to them.
- Jesus, Ma.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.859
Slow down. He's great.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.360
He's been nothing
but good to me.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.030
Anybody can be nice
at the beginning.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.406
Ma...

15:06.489 --> 15:08.241
Well, it's-it's good.
We're good.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.124
Why can't you just trust me?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.461
I'm sorry, Pallu, okay?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.630
But send me a photo of him, no?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.965
Okay, check your messages.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.049
- Yes.
- Love you.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.010
I love you.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.606
Feeling better?

15:39.689 --> 15:42.400
Pallu has a boyfriend.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.319
Huh.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.945
That's it?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.697
Now you can stop
worrying about her.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.491
Brought laddus.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.714
<i>How many?</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:06.800
Mm...

16:10.470 --> 16:11.554
Okay.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.392
- Eight.
- Eight.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.935
Respectable.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.145
I want to be respected.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.689
And you?

16:20.772 --> 16:23.316
- Tell me.
- Ooh... hmm.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.194
- Oh, God.
- Uh, mm...

16:26.277 --> 16:28.321
Oh, come on.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.407
I showed you mine.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.702
Two?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.663
Really?

16:36.746 --> 16:39.040
I'm a long-term relationship
kind of guy.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.918
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.422
Well, it's just that...

16:45.505 --> 16:48.675
I've, um, I've googled you.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.803
You do that a lot?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.304
Google people?

16:53.388 --> 16:54.806
The people that
I'm sleeping with?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.057
Uh, yeah.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.642
I'm a woman in the 21st century.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.602
Mm.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.814
I'm just saying,
it-it looks like you, um,

17:02.897 --> 17:06.651
ran with a hard-partying crew
in New York.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.986
And that's a crime now?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.115
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.577
- Oh. Yeah.
- It's just, um...

17:18.204 --> 17:20.957
Was one of them Miss India?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.959
First runner-up.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.586
- Okay.
- She wanted to get married.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.838
That's crazy.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.091
You were almost engaged
to almost Miss India.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.760
What happened?

17:34.012 --> 17:35.388
It's complicated.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.434
Like, how?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.770
It wasn't a good relationship.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.605
Oh.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.482
She cheated on you.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.360
No, it just didn't work out.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.363
Did she just want you
for your money or...

17:52.447 --> 17:53.990
No.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.659
- There were issues.
- Like what? What's that mean?

17:56.743 --> 17:59.120
Like she tried to kill herself
when I broke up with her.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.878
Shit.

18:06.961 --> 18:10.131
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It's okay.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.594
She wasn't
who I thought she was.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.808
Guess it's hard
to really know someone, right?

18:25.772 --> 18:29.400
If you want to know anything
about me, just ask.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.987
I'll tell you everything.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.952
I like you.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.038
I'll never lie to you or BS you.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.082
I promise.

18:44.165 --> 18:47.085
Promise you'll do the same?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.503
Yeah.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.509
Whoa. Yeah.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.522
Yeah.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.609
He's rich, he's cute,
and he's good with babies?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.611
No wonder we've hardly seen you
this last month.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.574
Is your mom happy?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.951
- I thought she was at first.
- Mm.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.704
But she's been asking me
these weird questions,

19:22.787 --> 19:24.706
like she's worried.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.250
Like he's too good to be true.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.296
Well, I'll take him
if you don't want him.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.589
Oh.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.756
That's so sweet.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.550
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind,
thank you.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.969
Well, we're happy for you.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.097
I didn't even think you believed
in love, and now look at you.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.726
Oh, I don't know about love.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.814
Please.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.441
You are smitten.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.154
- Bye, guys.
- Hey, we had so much fun.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.739
Thanks for coming.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.198
- Bye.
- Bye. Take care.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.867
Talk to you later.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.827
Happy month-iversary.

20:04.621 --> 20:05.872
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.081
We should celebrate, huh?

20:07.165 --> 20:08.207
Yeah.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.085
I got you something.

20:11.169 --> 20:15.131
Oh. No, I didn't mean that...

20:18.301 --> 20:20.178
They're sapphire.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.263
I saw them and thought of you.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.226
Um, this is too much.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.355
Come on, this is nothing.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.565
- Just try them on.
- Oh, no.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.192
I can't. I can't.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.401
They're really nice.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.362
I j... I can't accept these.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.072
Thank you.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.953
Okay.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.207
Hey.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.210
I just, I just wanted
to do something nice.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.004
Yeah, you did.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.007
You came to this party with me.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.009
You met my friends.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.678
That means a lot to me.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.063
Is this about your ex?

21:15.233 --> 21:17.110
She would...

21:17.193 --> 21:21.948
get upset if I didn't
show her appreciation.

21:22.031 --> 21:25.159
I sometimes wonder
if that's why she...

21:25.243 --> 21:27.036
No.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.621
No, I am not...

21:28.705 --> 21:30.248
I'm not like that.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.792
The earrings are beautiful.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.795
It's just... but...

21:35.878 --> 21:38.214
Save them for our engagement.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.720
- I'm...
- Uh...

21:43.803 --> 21:45.138
- I'm joking.
- Okay.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.221
Yeah.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.265
I'll save 'em.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.142
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.270
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

22:06.451 --> 22:08.369
Uh, Usha!

22:09.746 --> 22:12.248
Uh, this, th-this thing
is, uh...

22:13.291 --> 22:15.752
The-the...

22:15.835 --> 22:18.504
Usha!

22:18.588 --> 22:21.966
Usha, I'm having a bit of
a problem with the...

22:22.050 --> 22:23.676
I'm having some trouble
with the dal.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.011
Can you come look?

22:27.096 --> 22:30.099
You don't want
to eat tonight or what?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.518
That's it! I'm ordering pizza!

22:37.148 --> 22:38.691
Hello, Pallu?

22:38.775 --> 22:40.848
Sandeep wants you and
Papa to Skype with his parents.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.487
Wait, Pallu, what did you say?

22:42.570 --> 22:45.239
Sandeep wants you and Papa
to Skype with his parents.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.866
Already?

22:46.949 --> 22:49.577
He tried to give me jewelry.
Can you believe that?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.079
Jewelry?

22:51.162 --> 22:54.290
It was sweet,
but I gave it back, of course.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.583
Are you okay?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.585
You sound... weird.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.378
Yes. Uh, yes, of course.

22:59.462 --> 23:02.423
So, he wants to proceed
so quickly?

23:02.507 --> 23:04.300
He's more Indian
than I realized.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.177
Almost like
you found him for me.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.930
That's all very...
That's very good.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.765
Darling, can I just say,

23:10.848 --> 23:12.767
don't move in with him
until you are married.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.103
- Okay?
- Ma, come on.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.230
I'm just asking this one thing.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.649
It's like, I'm old-fashioned.
Please.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.027
I'll think about it.
I have to set up for class.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.905
Thank you.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.865
I love you very much.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.159
I love you, too.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.851
She's spending
all her time with him.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.437
He got her jewelry.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.772
It's too much. It's too soon.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.983
You only are too much.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.569
What?

24:04.652 --> 24:06.445
Now that there's
nothing to worry about,

24:06.529 --> 24:10.658
you have to invent
something new to worry about.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.410
Am I right?

24:15.413 --> 24:17.290
What time is it?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.709
It's 1:00.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.712
Go to sleep.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.005
Hmm.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.856
Hey, did you know
your hot water is out?

24:41.939 --> 24:43.357
Yeah, it comes in and out.

24:43.441 --> 24:46.110
- What?
- It's not that big of a deal.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.529
I just shower at the gym
when I have to.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.448
Dinner's ready.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.449
Sit.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.867
I apologize in advance.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.286
You'll have to eat around
the burnt bits.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.539
Or we could just go out.

24:59.874 --> 25:03.377
After I slaved all day
over this stove for my man?

25:03.461 --> 25:04.712
No.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.923
You have to try it.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.132
Give it a taste.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.012
"When your commander says

25:13.095 --> 25:14.639
"drop to the ground...

25:14.722 --> 25:16.224
...you drop to the ground."

25:18.100 --> 25:21.771
Wait, do you know
that expression?

25:21.854 --> 25:26.150
Uh, it's from the story of that
Indian army commander, right?

25:26.234 --> 25:28.027
That's my grandfather.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.528
Wow. Really?

25:29.612 --> 25:30.738
My <i>nanaji.</i>

25:30.821 --> 25:33.783
Uh, he used to say that

25:33.866 --> 25:36.285
to my mom,
to get her to listen to him.

25:36.369 --> 25:39.372
Supposedly, he saved a lot of
people that day. That's amazing.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.082
No one's ever said it
back to me before.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.670
Move in with me.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.296
What?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.882
You deserve better
than this place.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.261
I can't.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.304
I can't. My parents.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.141
Okay, then...

25:59.225 --> 26:01.185
then let me help you
with an apartment.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.063
Sandeep, no, you are not
helping me with an apartment.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.525
Pallavi, I...
Don't worry about the money.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.277
If I got you an apartment,

26:09.360 --> 26:12.071
what would that do
for your life?

26:12.154 --> 26:14.156
And no lies. You promised.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.371
I would write.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.956
Let me help you.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.041
Please.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.961
- Well, I have a job and...
- So? Quit.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.754
- It can wait.
- No.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.089
That's your friends talking.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.341
I can afford it.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.101
Ah, here we go.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.647
- Aw.
- Ah.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.441
Beautiful.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.524
And...

26:51.193 --> 26:52.695
Make a wish.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.990
Ah!

26:56.073 --> 26:58.576
But your biggest wish
has already come true,

26:58.659 --> 27:00.494
hasn't it, Usha?

27:00.578 --> 27:02.788
- Pallavi's found a boy.
<i>- Arre,</i> Usha.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.291
Why didn't you tell us?

27:05.374 --> 27:07.126
Ow!

27:10.504 --> 27:11.547
Did you burn yourself?

27:11.630 --> 27:12.965
- Are-are you okay?
- No, no, no.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.997
- Did you burn yourself? Usha... Put it in cold water.
- No, no.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.415
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll get this. I'll get this.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.887
- You all right?
- Yeah.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.014
I'm gonna go inside.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.754
Let's-let's stay out
a little bit more, no?

27:21.766 --> 27:23.267
It's such a nice evening.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.644
You enjoy the nice evening,
and... I just need to go.

27:25.728 --> 27:26.812
Usha, try, please.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.439
- It's okay.
- Please.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.985
I can't get her to stay outside.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.987
Let us talk to her.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.156
Come.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.741
All right, who wants cake?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.826
- Come on.
- Big, uh, big slice.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.411
Today's my cheat day.

27:42.495 --> 27:46.415
No, y-you have been saying no
to so many things lately.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.627
Come on, we've barely seen you
in the last, what, two months.

27:49.710 --> 27:54.215
Usha, are you sure his parents
are Nidhi and Rajdeep Patel?

27:54.298 --> 27:56.300
That's what Pallavi said.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.721
<i>Arre,</i> those Patels?

28:00.805 --> 28:04.141
My dear, these people own
half the motels in America.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.976
They're filthy rich.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.062
And this boy
has gone for Pallavi?

28:08.145 --> 28:10.105
Oh, Pallavi should marry him
fast before they send

28:10.147 --> 28:11.845
a private detective to come in
and look after her.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.180
- What detective? Don't be silly.
- Good idea.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.111
No. I'm not being silly.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.654
Hello.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.656
I'm not being silly, nah?

28:18.739 --> 28:20.366
I'm telling you,
it's all the rage

28:20.449 --> 28:22.326
with these richie-rich
South Delhi families.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.661
Happy birthday, Ma.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.329
Hi, Pallu.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.789
How's the party?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.958
It's good, but I wish
you were here, too.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.626
So do I.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.920
Um, I have exciting news.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.630
- Oh.
- I moved.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.466
- What?
- To a much nicer apartment.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.885
But you always said
you couldn't afford to move.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.221
Sandeep is helping out
with the rent.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.764
Actually with the move, too.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.891
We hired actual movers
like actual adults.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.017
Pallavi...

28:47.101 --> 28:48.978
I know. This thousand a month

28:49.061 --> 28:50.646
is like a drop
in the bucket to him.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.064
One thousand?

28:52.148 --> 28:53.774
He's being supportive.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.359
Ma, isn't that
what you want for me?

28:55.443 --> 28:57.445
Darling, can you give me

28:57.528 --> 29:00.197
his date of birth
and his time and place of birth?

29:00.281 --> 29:01.574
- No.
- What?

29:01.657 --> 29:03.063
- Why?
- You're not checking our horoscopes

29:03.075 --> 29:04.285
to see if we're compatible.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.649
You know I don't believe
in that stuff.

29:05.661 --> 29:06.941
You don't have to believe in it.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.205
I'll believe in it for you.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.291
He'll know exactly
why I'm asking.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.625
It's embarrassing, Ma.

29:11.709 --> 29:12.739
He's understanding, no?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.670
He seems very understanding.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.921
This is just for me.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.161
I'm not going to tell you
what I learn.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.215
Come, darling, please.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.819
Fine, I'll send it.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.093
Usha, darling?

29:21.177 --> 29:23.012
Everything all right?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.516
Ma?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.351
- Hello?
- Is that your mom?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.561
- Yeah.
- Can I...?

29:30.644 --> 29:31.562
Oh.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.272
Hey, Ma, um, Sandeep wants to...

29:33.355 --> 29:35.191
I have to go.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.276
Hello? Ma?

29:37.359 --> 29:38.527
Huh.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.779
Usha, everything okay?

29:40.863 --> 29:43.240
I'm fine. I'll be right out.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.665
<i>Thank you for coming
so quickly, Guruji.</i>

29:51.749 --> 29:53.501
<i>Oh, well,
for you, madam, of course.</i>

29:53.584 --> 29:56.170
How many boys have we seen
for Pallavi so far?

29:56.253 --> 29:58.088
- 100? 200?
- Not that much.

30:00.174 --> 30:03.928
But this one, madam,
this one is, uh...

30:04.011 --> 30:06.597
- I'm glad you called me.
- Oh, God.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.099
I knew it. I-I knew it.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.061
I have never seen such perfect
compatibility between two souls.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.270
What?

30:13.354 --> 30:15.356
This is a ten-out-of-ten match
for Pallavi.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.900
Wonderful. Wonderful.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.320
Tell me, tell me about the boy.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.906
Sandeep.
Tell me what's in this chart.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.575
Everything seems to be proper.

30:26.659 --> 30:29.286
He was born under
the Bharani star.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.746
Very auspicious.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.916
- Bharani star.
- Mm-hmm.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.167
He's a powerful man.

30:35.251 --> 30:38.170
Yes, very powerful, very rich.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.381
I would have the wedding
as soon as possible.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.841
Tell me about his character.

30:42.925 --> 30:43.842
Character?

30:43.926 --> 30:46.428
Uh, for that, we have to look at

30:46.512 --> 30:49.515
his yoga, madam... uh, his house.

30:49.598 --> 30:52.142
This young man is born
under the Gajakesari yoga.

30:52.226 --> 30:56.146
But not to worry...
His character is very strong.

30:56.230 --> 30:57.273
Very strong.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.108
He will get whatever he desires.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.532
Madam?

31:06.615 --> 31:08.075
Madam?

31:08.158 --> 31:10.077
- Madam, are you okay?
- Is she safe?

31:10.160 --> 31:12.121
- Pallavi?
- Safe?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.622
O-Okay.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.251
So, I keep sending her... no?
The necklaces, the bracelets.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.134
- She keeps forgetting to wear them.
- Mm-hmm.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.588
She's not protecting herself.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.339
The evil eye.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.717
Yes. She should
listen to you, madam.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.177
Uh, the horoscope says
everything is good.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.558
Uh, but if you want,
we can do another puja for you,

31:32.641 --> 31:35.144
just to set your mind
at ease, huh?

31:35.227 --> 31:38.188
Uh, only 5,000 rupees.

32:05.049 --> 32:07.051
Part of the writing process?

32:07.134 --> 32:09.678
Yeah. What if it is?

32:28.906 --> 32:30.032
Hello?

32:30.115 --> 32:31.659
What are you doing online, Ma?

32:31.742 --> 32:33.661
Isn't it, like,
3:00 a.m. in Delhi?

32:33.744 --> 32:35.579
I'll go to sleep soon.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.206
Are you at work?

32:38.916 --> 32:40.834
No, I'm home.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.586
Trying to work on my novel.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.464
I'm so glad you're
writing again, Pallavi.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.007
I know.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.635
About time I use
that writing degree for writing

32:49.718 --> 32:52.346
instead of
babysitting undergrads.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.391
So, you're not
going to work today?

32:55.474 --> 32:56.684
Or later?

32:56.767 --> 33:00.145
Well, actually, Ma, I quit.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.231
What?

33:02.314 --> 33:05.651
Yeah, it was sucking up
all my time and energy.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.987
And, um, now I have time
to actually write.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.365
Whose idea was this? Sandeep?

33:11.448 --> 33:14.743
Amma, I wish you would just
start with being happy for me.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.162
- How are you going to live?
- That's the thing.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.915
I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.838
You are not married yet.
This is irresponsible.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.211
Would it make a difference
if it were you and Papa

33:24.294 --> 33:26.547
who were supporting me
as I wrote my novel?

33:26.630 --> 33:29.174
Even if we could,
we would expect you to work.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.219
You can't just give up
your independence like that.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.346
Pallavi?

33:34.430 --> 33:36.348
Now you care about
my independence?

33:36.432 --> 33:37.975
What? I...

33:38.058 --> 33:40.352
Because you never
seemed to care before.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.896
Never seemed to care that I was
independent this whole time.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.565
What are you talking about?

33:44.648 --> 33:48.444
All I'm saying is that
this is moving too fast, no?

33:48.527 --> 33:51.405
Too fast? Too fast?

33:51.488 --> 33:53.824
Why do you think
this is happening so fast?

33:53.907 --> 33:55.951
What do you think
our relationship has been?

33:56.034 --> 33:57.119
You and me.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.998
- Pallavi...
- Wait, Ma.

34:01.081 --> 34:04.501
This whole time,
all these years,

34:04.585 --> 34:07.880
even when I was taking care
of myself and paying my bills,

34:07.963 --> 34:10.257
you made me feel like
I wasn't a good daughter.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.926
All because I was single.

34:13.010 --> 34:18.264
And now I'm with someone
that I am finally serious about,

34:18.348 --> 34:20.350
and you're still not happy.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.686
I'm still not doing it right.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.688
Do you know how big of a failure

34:24.772 --> 34:26.732
you make me feel like
every single day?

34:33.906 --> 34:35.908
Do you love him?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.829
Everything all right?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.625
That's all I'm saying.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.251
If you don't...

34:46.335 --> 34:48.920
And now you care about love, Ma?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.922
- You're such a hypocrite.
- Don't be hurtful.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.967
No. I don't know why
I cared so much about

34:54.051 --> 34:55.761
what you thought
all these years.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.768
Hey.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.395
- She drives me crazy.
- Oh, come here.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.356
Come here.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.157
Ignore it.

35:17.241 --> 35:19.243
You can call her tomorrow.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.423
<i>Not only that,
he spent his childhood</i>

35:33.507 --> 35:34.633
in boarding school.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.426
When he was 13,
his parents sent him away

35:36.510 --> 35:39.429
because, the same year,
there was a sealed court case,

35:39.513 --> 35:41.014
which we can't get access to,

35:41.098 --> 35:42.891
but clearly,
something terrible happened.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.103
Then he gets older
and drops out of college.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.689
Most importantly,
his ex-girlfriends...

35:48.772 --> 35:50.482
They don't want
to talk about him.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.484
Something's wrong.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.486
How did you find all this out?

35:54.570 --> 35:55.946
I hired a private detective.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.614
What?

35:57.698 --> 35:59.533
Yeah, I found him
on the Internet.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.452
How-how much did it cost?

36:02.536 --> 36:03.936
I'm trying to protect
your daughter.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.747
How much? Does it matter
how much it costs?!

36:05.831 --> 36:08.041
What you have done...

36:10.043 --> 36:11.587
...is disgraceful.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.257
This is a huge violation
of privacy.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.135
What if someone
investigated us, huh?

36:18.218 --> 36:19.970
Asked questions about our lives?

36:20.053 --> 36:23.724
How-how we fled to America
after Pallavi was born.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.933
My God.

36:25.017 --> 36:28.729
If his parents ever find out...

36:28.812 --> 36:31.356
His parents...
They know exactly who he is.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.442
A-And who is he?

36:33.525 --> 36:35.402
Have you not listened
to a word I said?

36:35.485 --> 36:37.613
Think about it.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.657
Who else do you know
who went to boarding school?

36:40.741 --> 36:43.076
Who else had too much wealth,
too much power?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.480
Who else destroyed
his girlfriends

36:44.536 --> 36:46.204
and they can't even
talk about him?

36:46.288 --> 36:47.831
Does that remind you of someone?

36:47.915 --> 36:52.169
These are all
superficial similarities.

36:52.252 --> 36:55.297
- Mm.
- It does not mean Sandeep is anything like that man.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.800
I have spoken to him
on the phone already.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.761
- He's a nice boy.
- I know.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.721
They all said he was nice.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.306
My friends were like, "So nice."

37:04.389 --> 37:06.058
My parents, "So nice."

37:06.141 --> 37:08.769
Usha, please listen.

37:08.852 --> 37:12.481
What happened to you
will not happen to our daughter.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.151
She won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.736
She's not like that.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.906
You've taught her
not to be like that.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.742
You're right.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.452
She's not like me.

37:25.535 --> 37:26.453
So just drop it.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.330
Please, please drop it.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.040
I just have to warn her.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.417
Usha, don't you dare.

37:32.501 --> 37:33.627
She listens to you.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.030
Your opinion is
everything to her.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.546
She doesn't care about
what I think.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.548
Doesn't care?

37:38.632 --> 37:41.343
Yes, that's-that's why
she talks to you every day, no?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.303
Because she doesn't care?

37:44.596 --> 37:46.431
Can-can you hear yourself?

37:46.515 --> 37:47.933
She's cursed.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.520
That man on the bridge cast an
evil eye when she was inside me,

37:51.603 --> 37:54.106
and she's suffering for it,
and I have to save her.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.899
This is madness.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.693
Can we...

37:57.776 --> 38:01.321
Can we please go to a doctor?

38:01.405 --> 38:02.864
This is paranoia, Usha.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.533
This is...

38:04.616 --> 38:06.618
It's delusional.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.472
Pa, what's up?

38:27.556 --> 38:29.725
Hello, Pallu.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.436
Did I, did I, did I...
did I wake you, darling?

38:32.519 --> 38:33.854
No.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.355
No, I'm awake.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.774
Not a problem.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.068
- What's up?
- I'm calling about your mother.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.404
I know what you're gonna say,

38:42.487 --> 38:44.614
but, honestly, she started it.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.992
No, no, no.
She's not well, Pallu.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.368
Not well?

38:48.452 --> 38:50.746
She-She's been having migraines.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.457
Bad ones. She's... been...

38:53.540 --> 38:55.083
very anxious, you know?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.793
She's not leaving the house.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.754
She's not...

38:58.837 --> 39:01.173
So, if-if she says
something to you, Pallu,

39:01.256 --> 39:03.759
just remember,
don't take it to heart, okay?

39:03.842 --> 39:06.970
She's-she's... she's just going
through something, you know?

39:07.054 --> 39:08.221
Papa?

39:08.305 --> 39:09.431
What's going on?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.516
You have me worried.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.855
Okay. Pallu, uh...

39:18.982 --> 39:21.777
...b-before your mother and I
got married, you know,

39:21.860 --> 39:23.570
a few years before that,

39:23.653 --> 39:26.698
you know, she had been
in a relationship,

39:26.782 --> 39:30.952
this one boy that she had met
in her college, and, um...

39:32.954 --> 39:34.039
And?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.417
It was, it was a very...

39:37.501 --> 39:39.544
bad relationship, darling.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.172
How bad?

39:42.255 --> 39:45.801
He-he was
sort-sort of dangerous.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.888
D-Didn't like to be rejected,
you know, and he...

39:49.971 --> 39:51.473
So your-your mother, you know,

39:51.556 --> 39:53.892
she had to escape
from him, sort of.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.269
Shit.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.646
Shit, Papa.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.940
Why didn't you ever
tell me about it?

40:00.023 --> 40:02.484
Uh, why tell you
about all this, you know?

40:02.567 --> 40:07.114
It's just... you know,
it's just some boy that she...

40:07.197 --> 40:09.533
Um, you know, I'm just...
It's n-no big deal.

40:09.616 --> 40:13.870
I'm just telling you now
so that you can understand.

40:13.954 --> 40:15.580
Understand what?

40:17.374 --> 40:20.502
What? Is-is he coming back
to bother her?

40:20.585 --> 40:22.963
No, no, no, darling. He's dead.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.590
He died after
Amma and I got married,

40:25.674 --> 40:27.759
just-just before you were born.

40:29.594 --> 40:33.181
Papa, what did he do to her?

40:35.225 --> 40:37.811
No, it... I-I don't know
all the details, darling.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.313
But, um...

40:40.397 --> 40:43.900
You know, she-she never really
recovered after that.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.443
Mentally.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.529
Emotionally.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.033
Oh, God.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.329
I'm so sorry.

40:56.413 --> 40:57.330
Poor Amma.

40:57.414 --> 41:00.917
I mean, no wonder.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.335
Yeah, so...

41:02.419 --> 41:03.628
God.

41:03.712 --> 41:06.214
It makes so much more sense now.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.633
But, Papa...

41:08.717 --> 41:10.677
why-why is she worried
about Sandeep?

41:10.760 --> 41:13.513
She doesn't think all men
are like that, does she?

41:13.597 --> 41:15.307
You want some coffee?

41:15.390 --> 41:17.934
I-Is that Sandeep?

41:18.018 --> 41:19.018
Yeah.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.770
He just came by, just now.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.064
Oh, he just,
he just came by, huh?

41:23.148 --> 41:25.233
He just happened to pop in?

41:25.317 --> 41:26.931
Darling,
what do you take me for?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.143
You're young, you're American.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.795
We didn't raise a nun, you know.
Come on.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.615
Okay, stop talk...

41:31.698 --> 41:33.450
Can we stop talking about it?

41:33.533 --> 41:35.702
Hey, can I,
can I speak with him?

41:36.786 --> 41:38.455
Oh, sure.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.457
Yeah. Um, one second.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.335
It's my dad.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.629
- I'll make us coffee.
- Okay.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.840
Hello, Uncle.

41:48.924 --> 41:50.592
Hello, my boy.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.469
How are you?

41:52.552 --> 41:54.179
I'm just great, Uncle.

41:54.262 --> 41:58.141
Actually, I'm glad you called.

41:58.225 --> 42:00.018
My parents are on board as well.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.811
I'm gonna propose to her.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.021
Wonderful.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.440
V-Very happy for you both.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.317
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Um, a-actually,

42:07.400 --> 42:09.432
uh, you know, Usha has been
very keen to speak with you.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.363
Now is a good time?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.364
Of course.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.199
Sandeep is on the phone.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.701
No, no, he asked for you.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.954
- No, he asked for you.
- I'm in a towel.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.248
Usha, he will mistake us
if you don't talk to him.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.499
He can't see you.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.960
Just take the phone, darling.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.466
Hello?

42:31.549 --> 42:32.968
Sandeep?

42:37.138 --> 42:38.932
Sandeep? Hello?

42:39.015 --> 42:42.143
Yes. Hello, Aunty.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.395
How are you?

42:44.604 --> 42:45.605
I'm fine.

42:45.689 --> 42:46.815
How are you?

42:46.898 --> 42:49.901
I'm doing well.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.695
It's good to hear your voice.

42:51.778 --> 42:52.988
Oh?

42:53.071 --> 42:54.614
Pallavi talks about you
all the time.

42:54.698 --> 42:56.616
Oh. Yes.

42:56.700 --> 43:00.495
Well, she talks about
you, too, obviously.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.248
I-I'm just a little busy
right now, so...

43:03.331 --> 43:05.750
Yes, of course. I'll let you go.

43:05.834 --> 43:08.837
I'm glad we connected.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.674
Feels like it was
meant to be, doesn't it?

43:15.176 --> 43:16.636
Wh-What does?

43:16.720 --> 43:19.097
Our relationship.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.057
Me and Pallavi, of course.

43:23.059 --> 43:27.397
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,
but I believe in fate.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.567
I think we have that in common,
don't we, you and I?

43:30.650 --> 43:32.068
Yes.

43:34.988 --> 43:39.034
I-I want to thank you
for Pallavi's apartment.

43:39.117 --> 43:42.037
Her writing, you know...
It's always been her dream,

43:42.120 --> 43:44.539
and it's just
too generous of you.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.292
Think nothing of it, Aunty.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.961
Everything I do
is only for her own good.

43:55.425 --> 43:56.468
Hello?

43:58.219 --> 43:59.721
Aunty? Hello?

43:59.804 --> 44:02.307
All right, goodbye, Sandeep.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.017
I have to go. Bye-bye.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.944
What?

44:15.028 --> 44:17.614
What-what are you doing?

44:18.782 --> 44:19.949
Usha?

44:20.033 --> 44:22.369
Usha, what...

44:22.452 --> 44:24.412
what's going on, darling?

44:28.708 --> 44:29.751
Usha?

45:06.579 --> 45:08.289
Usha?

45:11.751 --> 45:12.919
Where is this wom...

45:13.002 --> 45:15.088
Usha?

45:15.171 --> 45:17.048
Usha, are you here, darling?

45:23.388 --> 45:25.098
Usha?!

45:50.248 --> 45:52.333
Hello, Krishnan. What is wrong?

45:52.417 --> 45:54.115
Oh, Radhika, s-so sorry
to wake you, darling.

45:54.127 --> 45:55.670
Did-did Usha call you?

45:55.753 --> 45:59.924
Sh-She's, she's not here, and,
uh, she left her phone behind.

46:00.008 --> 46:02.343
Oh, she hasn't left
the house in two months.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.970
Why would she leave now?

46:04.053 --> 46:06.055
Where would she go?

46:41.925 --> 46:43.510
Usha?

46:43.593 --> 46:45.178
What's going on?

46:45.261 --> 46:47.805
I just needed to ask him
some questions.

46:47.889 --> 46:49.557
Ask who?

46:54.687 --> 46:56.105
He's dead.

46:56.189 --> 46:58.483
He's been dead and gone
for 30 years.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.985
I'm not so sure.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.613
So that big public inquest,

47:03.696 --> 47:07.075
that-that funeral that
dominated the papers, that...

47:07.158 --> 47:09.160
All-all of that didn't happen?

47:09.244 --> 47:10.703
No, I think he died.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.997
I just don't think
he ever went away.

47:13.081 --> 47:16.668
Okay, now, let's, uh...
let-let's go home.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.878
- Okay? Come on.
- You were right.

47:18.962 --> 47:20.255
About what?

47:20.338 --> 47:22.715
Pallavi. She's not like me.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.050
She's so smart.

47:24.133 --> 47:25.718
She's so independent.

47:25.802 --> 47:29.264
So, why is this pattern
repeating itself?

47:29.347 --> 47:32.600
There is only one answer.

47:32.684 --> 47:36.187
He has come back as Sandeep.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.481
He is Sandeep. Sandeep is him.

47:38.565 --> 47:40.692
- What are you saying?
- Sandeep told me on the phone

47:40.775 --> 47:45.321
that everything he does
is for Pallavi's own good.

47:45.405 --> 47:47.657
That's what he would say to me
every time.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.576
"It's all for your own good."

47:49.659 --> 47:51.494
It means nothing.

47:51.578 --> 47:52.996
Last night, you know what I did?

47:53.079 --> 47:56.541
I looked at Sandeep's birthday
on the star charts.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.209
It was right there.

47:58.293 --> 48:03.006
Sandeep was born nine months
after Pallavi was born.

48:03.089 --> 48:08.428
Nine months after that man
fell from this bridge.

48:12.223 --> 48:13.766
Come on.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.560
It's okay.

48:15.643 --> 48:18.938
It's okay. We're... we're going
to get you some help, darling.

48:19.022 --> 48:23.026
Let's... let's just
go home now, okay?

48:23.109 --> 48:24.611
Come on.

48:41.169 --> 48:43.421
You think I'm crazy.

48:43.504 --> 48:46.341
No, I-I think
that this is my fault.

48:46.424 --> 48:47.508
How is this your fault?

48:47.592 --> 48:50.428
We should never have
come back to Delhi.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.305
My career is not worth this.

48:52.388 --> 48:53.668
We can leave tomorrow
if we must.

48:53.723 --> 48:54.849
Oh, yeah, let's...

48:54.932 --> 48:56.601
No, no, I'm serious.

48:56.684 --> 48:59.812
Get away from this city,
all of these bad memories.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.731
It's-it's not good for you.

49:01.814 --> 49:03.733
It's not the bad memories.

49:03.816 --> 49:05.485
It's karma.

49:05.568 --> 49:07.153
We cannot escape our karma.

49:07.236 --> 49:11.240
If we ran to the ends
of the earth, he'd follow us.

49:12.325 --> 49:14.327
To finish what he started.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.082
Come.

49:53.950 --> 49:55.535
Hi, Mom.

49:55.618 --> 49:56.869
Hello.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.121
Are you asleep?

49:58.204 --> 50:00.665
No, I'm awake. I'm at Sandeep's.

50:00.748 --> 50:03.835
I'm sorry we haven't
talked in a few days.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.294
That's okay.

50:05.378 --> 50:06.671
How are you?

50:07.755 --> 50:09.298
I'm fine.

50:09.382 --> 50:10.508
How are you?

50:10.591 --> 50:11.759
Are you sure?

50:11.843 --> 50:14.637
You know you can
tell me anything.

50:16.848 --> 50:18.266
Yes.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.769
You know that goes
for you, too, right?

50:21.853 --> 50:23.396
What?

50:25.398 --> 50:28.484
Papa told me about the boyfriend
you had before you were married.

50:28.568 --> 50:31.654
What did Papa say?

50:31.738 --> 50:34.532
You were in
an abusive relationship.

50:34.615 --> 50:35.742
Weren't you, Ma?

50:35.825 --> 50:38.244
Your boyfriend hurt you?

50:39.829 --> 50:41.372
Yes.

50:41.456 --> 50:42.623
Oh, Ma.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.377
Oh.

50:46.461 --> 50:48.504
You don't know how much
that breaks my heart.

50:48.588 --> 50:51.090
This is why we never told you.
Why burden you with all this?

50:51.174 --> 50:53.259
Burden me? It's not a burden.

50:53.342 --> 50:56.262
I want to know
everything about you.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.514
You still know me.

50:59.891 --> 51:02.935
Pallu, nothing has changed, no?

51:03.019 --> 51:04.645
This changes everything.

51:04.729 --> 51:07.273
What? How?

51:07.356 --> 51:09.817
Your...

51:09.901 --> 51:12.612
Your obsession with me
finding the perfect husband...

51:12.695 --> 51:15.740
It's because you don't want me
to go through what you did.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.784
Well, yes. Of course.

51:17.867 --> 51:19.243
It's so clear.

51:19.327 --> 51:22.622
I found Sandeep on my own
without you.

51:22.705 --> 51:26.209
You're terrified
but for no reason.

51:26.292 --> 51:28.836
Sandeep has been
nothing but good to me.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.423
Good. Yes.

51:32.507 --> 51:36.093
Everything he does is only
for your own good, he said.

51:36.177 --> 51:38.179
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

51:41.349 --> 51:42.349
Please.

51:42.391 --> 51:43.684
I don't want to lose you.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.520
- Lose me?
- Yes.

51:45.603 --> 51:49.232
So, if I don't
approve of Sandeep,

51:49.315 --> 51:50.900
you'll choose him over me?

51:50.983 --> 51:52.777
Ma...

51:52.860 --> 51:55.029
we're engaged.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.323
He proposed last night.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.118
Why are you making this
so fucking painful

52:01.202 --> 52:03.037
for no fucking reason?

52:04.163 --> 52:06.082
I want you to leave him.

52:07.875 --> 52:10.753
- What?
- In fact, I insist.

52:10.837 --> 52:13.881
I order you, as your mother, if
you have any love for me at all.

52:13.965 --> 52:16.175
Amma... Amma, stop this.

52:16.259 --> 52:17.581
I know you're
going through something,

52:17.593 --> 52:20.054
but you cannot take it out on me
when I have done nothing.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.889
When Sandeep has done nothing.

52:21.973 --> 52:23.766
I hired a private investigator.

52:25.351 --> 52:27.270
- What?
- You know that there was

52:27.353 --> 52:29.522
a sealed cold case
from when he was 13?

52:29.605 --> 52:30.982
You cannot do things like this.

52:31.065 --> 52:32.191
Like, what is he hiding?

52:32.275 --> 52:35.111
Oh, my God.
He's not hiding anything.

52:35.194 --> 52:36.737
He broke some guy's car window

52:36.821 --> 52:38.644
when they were fighting about
a girl or something.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.199
He was young and stupid.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.273
His parents sealed the case.
He told me everything.

52:42.285 --> 52:43.786
Are you happy?

52:43.870 --> 52:45.246
So, he has a temper?

52:46.289 --> 52:47.999
You're exaggerating.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.042
Why was he forced out
of his first college?

52:50.126 --> 52:52.503
He wasn't forced out.
He dropped out.

52:52.587 --> 52:54.171
He wanted to start
a new business.

52:54.255 --> 52:55.715
And then this
string of girlfriends.

52:55.798 --> 52:58.278
Like, the private investigator
talked to at least five of them.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.469
None of them had
anything good to say about him.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.722
In fact, they don't want
to talk about him at all.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.348
You sound like a crazy person.

53:04.432 --> 53:05.641
Crazy?

53:06.726 --> 53:07.894
Fuck, Ma, I'm sorry.

53:07.977 --> 53:09.645
I didn't, I didn't
mean it like that.

53:11.230 --> 53:13.733
What do your friends
think about him, hmm?

53:13.816 --> 53:16.986
Like, what does Sonia and Kelly
think about him?

53:17.069 --> 53:18.279
They love him.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.573
And what do they think about
him paying your rent

53:20.656 --> 53:22.325
and about you quitting your job?

53:25.036 --> 53:27.163
You never told them.

53:27.246 --> 53:29.999
What does it matter?
We're getting married.

53:30.082 --> 53:33.628
It matters because you just keep
making excuses for him, for you!

53:33.711 --> 53:38.341
I'm asking you
to obey me, trust me.

53:38.424 --> 53:41.093
I'm telling you
to drop to the ground.

53:41.177 --> 53:43.137
Ma, you need help.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.514
I'm trying to save
your life, Pallu!

53:45.598 --> 53:46.807
What?

53:48.517 --> 53:50.937
Amma. Amma.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.523
You can't say that
and stop talking.

53:56.776 --> 53:58.903
I'm...

54:00.613 --> 54:02.448
<i>Mom? Hello?</i>

54:03.616 --> 54:04.867
Are you there?

54:04.951 --> 54:07.370
Ma, are you there?

54:07.453 --> 54:09.664
Hello?

54:09.747 --> 54:11.082
Ma, are you there?

54:14.043 --> 54:16.963
Do you know the scar
on my forehead?

54:17.046 --> 54:18.089
Yes.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.341
He gave it to me.

54:20.424 --> 54:23.260
That man, my boyfriend.

54:23.344 --> 54:26.180
You said that you got that in a
car accident before I was born.

54:26.263 --> 54:29.600
No. He slammed my head
onto a concrete barrier.

54:32.895 --> 54:35.523
<i>I was working as
a teacher in Delhi.</i>

54:36.899 --> 54:38.192
<i>I was happy,</i>

54:38.275 --> 54:40.069
<i>and for the first time
in a long time,</i>

54:40.152 --> 54:42.571
<i>I was hopeful for the future.</i>

54:45.658 --> 54:48.202
<i>I thought I was rid of him.</i>

54:48.285 --> 54:51.288
<i>Your papa and I had been
married for two years.</i>

54:53.124 --> 54:57.128
<i>When that man found out
that I had moved on,</i>

54:57.211 --> 55:00.548
<i>he started calling,
following me.</i>

55:00.631 --> 55:05.678
<i>He made sure
I knew he was there.</i>

55:05.761 --> 55:08.806
<i>I would spot his car everywhere.</i>

55:10.224 --> 55:15.021
<i>Whenever I left work,
he'd be waiting for me.</i>

55:15.104 --> 55:18.691
<i>I kept hoping he would move on.</i>

55:18.774 --> 55:22.278
<i>I didn't tell your father
how bad it was.</i>

55:22.361 --> 55:25.281
<i>I started taking shortcuts,</i>

55:25.364 --> 55:27.700
<i>detours, deviations...</i>

55:27.783 --> 55:31.287
<i>Anything I could do
just to throw him off...</i>

55:31.370 --> 55:35.291
<i>But he... he refused to give up.</i>

55:35.374 --> 55:40.296
<i>When it happened, I was
eight months pregnant with you.</i>

55:40.379 --> 55:44.175
<i>His car followed me
to the Yamuna Bridge.</i>

55:51.265 --> 55:52.433
My darling.

55:52.516 --> 55:54.852
No. Don't come near me.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.812
I'm asking you nicely.

55:57.563 --> 55:58.898
Come with me!

55:58.981 --> 56:00.900
Stop fighting me!

56:10.743 --> 56:11.869
<i>At that moment,</i>

56:11.952 --> 56:14.872
<i>I knew he was going to kill me.</i>

56:14.955 --> 56:17.708
More than that, I knew
he was going to kill you.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.338
<i>I don't know how I did it.</i>

56:22.421 --> 56:25.591
<i>I overpowered him
and pushed him off that bridge.</i>

56:32.765 --> 56:36.102
<i>The water was filthy,
and he didn't know how to swim.</i>

56:48.405 --> 56:50.574
<i>After that, I ran.</i>

56:50.658 --> 56:53.202
<i>Thankfully,
a rickshaw wallah stopped</i>

56:53.285 --> 56:55.204
<i>and he drove me
to the nearest hospital.</i>

56:55.287 --> 56:57.832
<i>I didn't even know
I was going into labor.</i>

57:00.751 --> 57:02.962
You were a miracle baby.

57:03.045 --> 57:05.047
You were born early but healthy.

57:07.258 --> 57:10.261
The police never charged
anyone for his death.

57:13.264 --> 57:15.015
Amma...

57:15.099 --> 57:16.225
are you...

57:16.308 --> 57:18.144
are you serious?

57:19.478 --> 57:21.522
You're not making this up?

57:21.605 --> 57:24.316
Why would I make it up?

57:24.400 --> 57:27.319
Y-You killed someone?

57:27.403 --> 57:28.821
Yes.

57:30.364 --> 57:32.366
Police never found out?

57:32.449 --> 57:34.618
They never even thought of me.

57:34.702 --> 57:36.203
He had so many enemies.

57:36.287 --> 57:37.621
He was in debt.

57:37.705 --> 57:39.915
That night when he died,

57:39.999 --> 57:43.294
I was in hospital
giving birth to you.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.004
And Papa...

57:45.087 --> 57:48.174
Papa knows everything.

57:48.257 --> 57:51.594
You-you never once told me...

57:51.677 --> 57:53.721
How could have I told you?

57:53.804 --> 57:55.055
I...

57:55.139 --> 57:56.724
I didn't even want
to talk about it.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.393
I didn't want
to think about it ever.

57:59.476 --> 58:02.813
The only reason I'm telling you
now is because I have to,

58:02.897 --> 58:05.274
because you wouldn't
listen otherwise.

58:05.357 --> 58:07.610
What? What do you mean?

58:09.361 --> 58:12.114
Have you ever noticed
that Sandeep's birthday

58:12.198 --> 58:14.658
- is nine months after yours?
- Usha.

58:14.742 --> 58:17.411
I don't under... what do...
I don't understand.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.079
What does that have to do
with anything?

58:19.163 --> 58:20.206
He's back, Pallu.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.293
He's been reborn as Sandeep.

58:27.379 --> 58:28.505
Give...

58:29.798 --> 58:30.925
Usha, please.

58:33.928 --> 58:35.888
- Usha, please.
- You're laughing?

58:35.971 --> 58:38.015
Don't do this.

58:38.098 --> 58:41.560
Because, um, um, my-my...

58:41.644 --> 58:43.938
my brain is breaking.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.649
No, this, this is...

58:46.732 --> 58:48.359
this is terrible.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.946
Do you understand
everything I just said?

58:52.029 --> 58:56.075
Sandeep told me that everything
he does is for your own good.

58:56.158 --> 58:59.495
That is exactly what that man
told me after hurting me.

58:59.578 --> 59:02.331
He told me that
while hurting me, Pallu.

59:03.999 --> 59:05.960
Ma, I-I-I...

59:06.043 --> 59:07.962
I don't know what to say.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.257
Have you seen a doctor?

59:11.340 --> 59:12.716
There's nothing wrong with me.

59:12.800 --> 59:16.095
You sound like
you believe what you're saying.

59:16.178 --> 59:17.721
Please, Ma, see a doctor.

59:17.805 --> 59:19.223
Okay?

59:19.306 --> 59:21.600
I-I don't, I don't
want to lose you.

59:21.684 --> 59:23.644
I will do
whatever the hell you want

59:23.727 --> 59:26.188
as long as you leave Sandeep
before it's too late.

59:26.272 --> 59:28.190
No, Ma. No.

59:28.274 --> 59:30.025
No? You don't want to lose me,

59:30.109 --> 59:32.736
but what will I do
if I lose you?

59:32.820 --> 59:34.488
You're my life.

59:36.156 --> 59:39.201
I-I want you to, I want you
to take a deep breath, okay?

59:39.285 --> 59:40.869
It's gonna be okay.

59:40.953 --> 59:42.496
I know you've
been through things

59:42.579 --> 59:46.417
that I can't even imagine,
but just... just listen.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.043
Just listen to me.

59:48.127 --> 59:50.713
Sandeep is
everything that I want.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.382
You asked me if I love him.

59:55.009 --> 59:57.469
I do.

59:57.553 --> 59:59.346
We love each other.

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.849
He makes me happy.

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:07.062
Can you hear me, Ma?

01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:09.898
I'm-I'm with him right now.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.775
Will you talk to him?

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:13.819
Pallu.

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.321
Will you just talk to him?

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.905
Okay?

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.116
She's not
taking the engagement well.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.747
Hello, Aunty.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:29.043
I know that Pallavi and I
are taking a big step,

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.880
and I know
how close you guys are.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:36.467
The last thing I want to do
is mess that up.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.178
So...

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:43.932
I haven't talked about this
to Pallavi yet, but...

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:47.978
I don't feel comfortable
getting married until

01:00:48.062 --> 01:00:52.858
and unless you give us
your blessing.

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.486
Does that...

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.529
Does that help?

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.249
Yes.

01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:14.630
I would really love
to meet you in person.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.256
I have a guest room that is

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.300
yours to claim
any time you like.

01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:19.551
You and Uncle.

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:25.265
I love your daughter,
and I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.936
Okay.

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:34.400
Goodbye, Sandeep.

01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:42.991
You okay?

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.786
- I'm so sorry.
- No. No.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.288
I'm sorry. I just...

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.376
Thank you.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:01.468
I have thought, over
and over again, all these years,

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.554
that I should have
been there for you

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.556
when he was following you.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:09.768
I never should have let things
get to where they did.

01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:12.187
That-that was my failing.

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:14.273
So I understand...

01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:19.445
...that whatever I say, you...

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.280
you have no reason
to believe me.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.198
I accept that.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.244
Darling...

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.204
that's not what I think.

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:33.041
But has Pallavi ever given you
a reason not to accept her,

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:34.710
to-to trust her?

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.837
No.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.257
You have raised
a wonderful daughter.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:45.387
And, my God, finally,
she has found a wonderful boy.

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:48.724
You saved her.

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:51.518
Saved yourself, saved us.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:58.692
And, oh, because of that,

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.777
you are safe.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.072
Huh?

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:06.158
Now, always.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.873
But I don't want to feel
like this anymore.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.708
- I...
- I know, darling.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:19.588
You don't have to look
over your shoulder anymore.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:34.269
It's going to be
Pallu's birthday

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:37.356
- in a few hours.
- Ah, right.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:39.149
Hey, we'll, uh...

01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:42.236
we'll call her this evening
when she wakes up.

01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:45.864
So, I'll collect you
at 4:00 sharp.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:51.078
Dr. Mehta is
supposed to be the best.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.829
- I'll be ready.
- All right.

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.831
Can you throw this out for me?

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.668
What?

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.463
Uh, are you sure?

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:04.091
It's like you said.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.884
I'm safe now.

01:04:05.968 --> 01:04:08.303
I need to move on.

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:10.389
You are safe.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:14.142
All right.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.169
- Love you!
- Love you!

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.425
<i>He tried to give me jewelry.</i>

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:35.057
Pallu, thank God. Listen.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.142
Did you like
the earrings I got her?

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.938
I saw you liked that photo
online.

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:44.524
So you must've liked
those earrings.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.818
But of course you do.

01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:49.112
They're just to your taste,
aren't they?

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.867
I remember
you never took yours off.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:58.830
You used to wear your hair up
just so everyone could see them.

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:02.584
So you could show me
how much you loved them,

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:06.129
how much you appreciated
my gift.

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.589
What do you want?

01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:10.092
I told you.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:13.095
I really want to see you.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.097
In person.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.182
We could be a family.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.144
It's amazing.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.439
Pallavi has your same...
essence,

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:27.734
that same spirit.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:31.238
That's what made me talk to her
in that coffee shop.

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:36.118
I saw her face...

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:38.662
and I couldn't resist.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.039
Even though I didn't know why.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.086
But of course it wasn't until
I heard your voice

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.506
that everything
clicked into place.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.299
That's when I remembered.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.512
Everything.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.848
Don't hurt her.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.934
No, no, no, I-I promise.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.854
I'm going to take care
of Pallavi.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:06.189
Till death do us part.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.192
As the saying goes.

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:11.486
Give the phone to her.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.905
I will.

01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:16.032
Eventually.

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:18.201
The fun is just beginning, Usha.

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.143
Usha? Are you ready?

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:49.691
Usha, she has
a full schedule, darl...

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.210
Pick up the phone, Pallu.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:10.504
Pick up the bloody phone.
Come on, Pallavi.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.993
Hey, it's Pallavi.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.405
You know the drill.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.747
Pallavi, I don't know
when you're going to get this,

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.719
darling, but please call me.
It's urgent.

01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:24.309
It's Usha.

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:26.770
Please leave a message.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:29.022
<i>Usha, if you,
if you can hear this,</i>

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.983
<i>please call me back.</i>

01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:35.319
Um, uh, can you go faster,
please?

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:44.328
<i>It's Usha.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.706
<i>Usha, please listen.</i>

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.707
<i>Think about what you are doing.</i>

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.877
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:54.089
<i>Please, just text me, anything.</i>

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.509
<i>No matter what, darling,
I love you.</i>

01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:06.768
Pallu?

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:15.443
Pallavi?

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:19.781
Are you there? Pallavi?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.202
My darling.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.084
Where is she?

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.837
You're here.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.341
You've changed.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.803
We both have.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.265
Rakesh...

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.225
this is between you and me.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:49.895
Leave Pallavi alone.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:52.898
That's not how this works.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:55.191
You don't get to decide
how it ends.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:57.569
Not this time.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:03.658
What is it that you want?

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:07.621
The only thing
I've always wanted, Usha.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.500
You.

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:13.752
Forever.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.421
Um...

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:26.056
Why can't you just let it go?

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.975
Because you're mine.

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.435
Don't you see that?

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.315
Where is Pallavi?

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:43.740
Behave, and I will
bring you to her.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.159
We'll have dinner,
and you will show Pallavi

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.746
that I am the husband
you've always wanted for her.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.290
O-Okay.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.377
Dinner.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.337
Great.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.048
See how easy that was?

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.842
You know that everything I do
is for your own good.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.104
Say it.

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:22.153
Everything you have done
is for my own good.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.992
And now Pallavi
will finally be happy,

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.452
knowing that she's the daughter
you've always wanted.

01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:31.788
She is the daughter
I've always wanted. I...

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.999
No, not until she's married.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.917
Right, Usha?

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.213
You'll give her your blessing?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.049
Yes.

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:45.468
I will.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:47.387
You will?

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.598
I know you, Usha.

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:52.100
Remember?

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:54.602
You're lying. Don't lie to me.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:58.064
Don't you want your daughter
to stay alive?

01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:10.827
Who are you gonna call?

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.955
Everyone thinks you're crazy.

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:17.542
Krishnan will believe me.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.544
That pathetic husband?

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.212
You know he doesn't believe you,

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:23.882
because you don't love him
and he knows it.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.550
You're wrong.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.011
You taught Pallavi how to settle
when you married him.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.473
You wanted her to marry
a good man regardless of love.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.475
All this would have been
so much harder

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.518
if she had been
holding out for true love.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.312
Even I can't fake that.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.861
I really don't want
to kill Pallavi.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:57.332
I will come with you.

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.084
And I will tell her

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:03.296
that she has my blessing
to marry you.

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:15.558
Good.

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:32.742
Keep it.

01:13:32.826 --> 01:13:34.828
If you think it'll help.

01:13:46.548 --> 01:13:48.675
You know...

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:52.011
I never believed in
that superstitious nonsense.

01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:56.474
Joke's on me, right?

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.570
After you.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.775
If I suspect
you are trying to sway her,

01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:52.822
if I suspect even the slightest
hint of disobedience,

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:54.657
I will kill her immediately.

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.576
Do you understand?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.955
Shall we?

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.253
Hi.

01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.926
Amma.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.053
Pallu.

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:18.681
You're here.

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:21.017
You're here.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:24.062
What are you doing here?

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.066
You knew?

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:29.567
Happy birthday.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.404
Thank you.

01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:34.822
Oh.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.412
Oh, my... I...

01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:43.539
Actually, Sandeep
bought the ticket himself.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:45.959
Wow. Okay.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.961
It's so good to see you.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.088
Let me take your things.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.674
Come in.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:53.788
Sandeep is
making dinner tonight.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.468
- Oh.
- Your favorite.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.594
Mirch ki sabzi.

01:15:56.678 --> 01:15:57.887
Mmm.

01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.348
You planned it all, didn't you?

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.641
Of course he did.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:04.435
He wanted to make me
feel welcome.

01:16:04.519 --> 01:16:06.854
See? I knew if you just
met him in person,

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.357
everything would be fine.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:17.615
<i>And I look,</i>

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:19.117
and Danny is just
standing there,

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.704
- covered in lentils and idli.
- Yeah.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.414
Oh, my God.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.291
And he turns and looks at me.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:28.960
Half of his eyebrows
were burnt clean off.

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.547
It was a disaster.
We were cleaning sambar

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.257
off the ceiling the whole night.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.384
Never trust a white guy
with a pressure cooker.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.635
Yeah.

01:16:37.719 --> 01:16:40.054
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:16:40.138 --> 01:16:42.098
Sit, Aunty, please.
You're our guest, after all.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.767
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you relax, Ma.

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:47.729
You had such a long flight.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.231
Oh, you know,
I was telling your mom

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.608
she is welcome to stay with us
as long as she wants.

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:53.818
What do you think?

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.737
Oh. Sure, of course.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.155
You want to talk to her?

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:59.240
Talk to her. I'm right here.

01:17:07.749 --> 01:17:11.169
Um, Amma, so...

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.339
Well, I-I didn't get
a chance to tell you...

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:17.050
- It's all right.
- Um...

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.052
I'm moving in with Sandeep.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.970
And I know it's before
we're married...

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:23.097
I'm happy for you.

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:25.141
You're happy for me?

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.101
Of course I am, darling.

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:32.273
But I... You-you were...

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.400
No, I was wrong before.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.612
Who are you,

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.364
and what have you done
with my mother?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.659
You should do
whatever you want to do.

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.078
Is everybody done?

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.538
- Do you want any more before I take this away?
- No.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:51.042
Oh, yeah, it was so good.
Dinner was so good, Sandeep.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.168
Thank you.

01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:57.340
It was your recipe, Ma.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.759
Extra spicy. Could you tell?

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.887
We literally had to buy more
chili powder because we ran out.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.472
Yeah, I could tell.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.641
It was just like I used to
make it, right, Sandeep?

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:09.769
Yes. I-I mean,
I'm sure yours is much better.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.943
Wait, Ma,
why did you come alone?

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.529
Did Sandeep not tell you?

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.239
Tell me what?

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.325
I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.576
Oh, yes. It's all right.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.955
So, Papa had to work,
and he said, "No, you go alone."

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.164
Really?

01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:31.958
Mom, you hate flying alone.

01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:34.293
Whoa.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:36.379
You okay?

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:37.547
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.173
Just being a klutz.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.051
It's so sweet, though.

01:18:42.135 --> 01:18:44.929
Sandeep... he bought
a ticket for Papa.

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:46.431
That was so nice of you.

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.641
Yes. Of course.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.977
It's too bad
he couldn't make it.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.603
Such a nice man.

01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:54.897
Didn't want to accept charity.

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:03.865
We may not be rich, but
Papa can afford a plane ticket.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:05.700
I mean, that can't be
the reason.

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.660
It is, Pallu. You know him.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.036
I-It's all right.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.247
And I'm not going to be
staying that long.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:13.708
- What? Why?
- You're gonna be busy, no?

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:17.295
You're moving in together.
I don't want to be in the way.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:19.380
Shit.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.799
Amma, you're mad at me,
aren't you?

01:19:21.883 --> 01:19:23.050
Of course you are.

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.385
No.

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:25.678
Pallu, no.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.097
Why-why do you keep saying that?

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:31.893
Because I just thought...

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:34.061
I guess I was expecting a fight.

01:19:34.145 --> 01:19:36.147
Pallu, no.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.982
I'm so sorry,

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:41.777
because I kept pressuring you
about getting married, and...

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:45.156
and I made you feel
like a failure.

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.074
You could never be
a failure to me.

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.410
I trust you, Pallu.

01:19:49.494 --> 01:19:51.412
Please, trust yourself.

01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:53.873
You must be exhausted, Aunty.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:55.958
No? Let's get you to bed.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.669
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.505
Yeah, we can talk more tomorrow.

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:02.757
You should take some rest.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.300
Yeah.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.469
Okay.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:12.725
Um, where is the guest room?

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.352
- Oh, I'll show you.
- Oh, of course.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:16.020
It's up the stairs,
to the right.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.510
Yeah, I'll just show her
where it is.

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:19.524
No, no, no. Come on.
We'll do the dishes.

01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:21.263
- We'll give you a minute, Aunty, okay?
- Okay.

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:22.995
We'll do the dishes first,
and then we'll...

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:24.391
- Yeah. No, she...
- No, let me just show you.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.935
No, right... We...
Okay, you want to go up?

01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:27.827
- Let's go up. No, no.
- No, why would we go up?

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.116
No, that's fine. Let's go up.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.648
- You want to go up? Okay, let's go.
- No.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.815
- We'll all go up.
- No, no. Yeah.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:32.954
I'll bring your suitcase up.

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:34.247
What the hell is going on?

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.166
Why are you acting so weird?

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:40.366
Okay, it's nothing.
Let's just go up.

01:20:40.378 --> 01:20:41.898
Let's go up.
I'll take the suitcase up.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.756
Let's go up.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.397
Amma, where did you get those?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.857
Someone gave them to me
in college.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.360
Uh, okay.

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.392
- I think I know what's going on.
- They're the same.

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:07.655
They're the same.

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:09.657
All right, Usha, listen to me.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.866
I see what's happening here.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:12.952
You know.

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:18.165
- You know exactly why.
- You need help, Usha.

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:19.375
Pallavi has told me.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.002
Let us help you, okay?

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.296
For your own good. Hmm?

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:24.899
Always for my own good,
right, darling?

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:26.591
Shut your mouth!

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.095
What?

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.644
Do you know my mother?

01:21:41.439 --> 01:21:44.358
Do you know my mother, Sandeep?

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:50.031
Drop to the ground.

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:06.631
Amma!

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:10.717
You're hurt.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.102
Fine.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.772
No!

01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:28.194
Let her go.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.403
Let her go!

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.406
Let go!

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:34.408
You did this.

01:22:34.492 --> 01:22:35.576
I warned you.

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.244
Please.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:42.500
Darling...

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.711
...look towards me.

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:52.593
I'm here with you.

01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:54.762
Look at me.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.433
Just me...

01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:01.560
...my darling.

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:08.693
My eyes!

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:10.653
Darling.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.142
Okay, okay. It's okay.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.197
Fucking bitch!

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.668
You can't run.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.878
I will always find you.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.972
I will not run anymore.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:44.936
My darling.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:52.570
Amma.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:55.197
Amma. Amma.

01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:56.323
Amma, stay with me.

01:23:56.407 --> 01:23:57.407
Amma.

01:23:59.618 --> 01:24:01.620
Amma. Amma.

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:04.874
Amma.

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.167
- Amma, I'm here.
- Pallu.

01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:11.630
Amma.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:13.132
Amma.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.761
Amma?

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.973
Stay with me, Amma.

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.656
<i>Meri jaan.</i>

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:43.329
<i>You're mine. Don't you see that?</i>

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:44.830
<i>Meri jaan.</i>

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:45.790
<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>

01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:46.791
<i>You're mine. Forever.</i>

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.250
<i>Please just listen.</i>

01:24:49.919 --> 01:24:51.837
Oh, I'm sorry to wake you.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:55.466
No, it's fine.

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:57.009
Uh, your husband called.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.886
He's at the airport.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.221
He'll be here soon.

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.848
Thank you.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:04.975
Pallavi's gonna be
so happy to see him.

01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:08.979
Pallavi.

01:25:09.063 --> 01:25:11.190
The first verse of a song?

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.608
That's very good.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.068
You speak Hindi?

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:16.153
A little.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.073
Hello.

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:23.828
I'll let you two rest.

01:25:23.911 --> 01:25:25.704
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:27.373
Pallu.

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:29.041
Hi.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.126
You okay?

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.634
- This is all my fault.
- No.

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:40.803
No.

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.012
Yeah.

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:44.223
I just didn't...

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:47.059
I didn't listen to you,
and I should've.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.894
And I didn't believe you,
and I should've.

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:51.814
Pallu, it is not your fault.

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.275
It's over.

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.318
But it's not over, right?

01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:59.113
Like, what if he wakes up and...

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:02.408
and comes after you again,
or me or...?

01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:05.202
What if he dies and...

01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:06.912
- Or what if...
- So?

01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:08.706
What if he does?

01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:10.624
What if he comes back?

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.335
Come here.

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.758
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:28.017
- It's okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:32.730
So... say he keeps coming back.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.901
What would you say
to your daughter?

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:41.030
I don't know.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.782
Men like this
will always be there.

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.743
So you'll teach your daughter

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.162
and your daughter
will teach her daughter

01:26:48.245 --> 01:26:51.290
that none of this
is their fault.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:54.668
And y-you will face him
together.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.216
Like we did.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:18.192
Do you know he speaks Hindi?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.283
How do you even know that?

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:29.161
I'm your mother.

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:33.082
- It hurts when I laugh.
- Oh, no.

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:34.708
I love you.

01:27:34.792 --> 01:27:36.794
I love you, too, Ma.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.642
<i>Code blue, room 305.</i>
