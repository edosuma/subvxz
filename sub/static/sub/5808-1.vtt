Casey?

02:31.416 --> 02:34.318
- Something wrong, Mr. Bast?
- No, not at all.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.555
I was curious if you'd started
weighing your college options.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.524
Options? Uh...

02:39.526 --> 02:42.226
Heard of the Helen Stoller
Physics Scholarship?

02:42.228 --> 02:44.795
- No.
- It's given to a student
in this part of the state

02:44.797 --> 02:47.398
who shows the most promise
in the sciences.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.668
Wouldn't that be
Ann or... Wyatt?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.470
No, it's you.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.906
You have a calling, Casey.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.408
I do?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.477
- What is it?
- Physics.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.711
Toast?

03:00.713 --> 03:03.814
- Uh... sure.
- You're very lucky.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.817
Most people search their
whole lives for their calling.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.653
How do you know
if you have a calling?

03:08.655 --> 03:10.555
Your brilliant teacher
tells you so.

03:10.557 --> 03:14.358
And of course your 11 straight
A-pluses on exams is a hint.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.361
You'll need a letter from me
for the scholarship

03:17.363 --> 03:20.698
and think about a special
physics project over the summer.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.501
Something unusual but personal.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.937
Let them know you a little.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.839
- He says it's my calling.
- QED.

03:28.841 --> 03:33.377
How is this "quite easily
demonstrated"? You're as good
in physics as I am.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.948
Not even close.
I grind, you glide.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.849
Event horizon.

03:41.353 --> 03:44.589
One day that guy
is gonna wake up and
realize he needs a math tutor.

03:44.591 --> 03:47.491
And that tutor will be me.

03:47.493 --> 03:52.230
Figure out how to get us
invited to even one party
and you win the Nobel.

04:11.283 --> 04:13.484
Hey, you're Casey, right?

04:13.486 --> 04:15.686
Uh-huh.

04:15.688 --> 04:19.357
Here's an invite
to my boyfriend's party.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.292
Wow.

04:21.294 --> 04:23.561
You're in chem lab
with Julian Wilson, right?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.630
- Mm-hm.
- Can you give that to him?

04:25.632 --> 04:27.665
Thanks.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.737
That was way inconsiderate.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.872
I love Mr. Bast.

04:34.874 --> 04:38.676
If he uncovered a scholarship
I didn't know about,
he's a genius.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.279
And to think they pay him
almost nothing.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.683
The devaluation of teachers
in our society, it just...

04:45.685 --> 04:47.518
- It blows my mind.
- Mom.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.354
I'm back. Sorry.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.558
I have to figure out
what he wants from me.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.361
I mean, what is
a personal science project?

04:57.363 --> 05:02.566
Isn't the nature of science
supposed to be completely
unbiased and factual?

05:02.568 --> 05:04.702
Now he wants the inner me, too?

05:04.704 --> 05:06.937
The whole secret
of the study of nature

05:06.939 --> 05:09.674
lies in learning
how to use one's eyes.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.677
- You know who said that?
- I'm guessing it was a woman.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.412
That was written by George Sand,

05:14.414 --> 05:16.647
a woman forced
to use a man's name

05:16.649 --> 05:18.649
because she
couldn't get published.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.751
- Mom.
- Okay.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.354
Anyway,
I always tell my students,

05:23.356 --> 05:27.058
"You'll know your topic when
you learn how to use your eyes."

05:27.060 --> 05:30.561
<i>[TV: classical music]</i>

05:33.799 --> 05:36.000
Oh! Oh, no...

05:36.002 --> 05:38.336
She had it locked up.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.573
I need to eat ice cream
and all your mother
has is leftover tofu.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.576
- Can we go?
- Sh! Sh!

05:45.578 --> 05:47.845
Look at that recovery! Amazing.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.114
She'll still place.

05:52.017 --> 05:56.387
She's so precise.
I mean, down to the last...

05:59.858 --> 06:02.059
You know...

06:02.061 --> 06:06.630
I bet there is an exact
aerodynamic formula.

08:03.249 --> 08:06.250

08:34.247 --> 08:36.247
She's a science geek.

08:42.921 --> 08:46.524
Look, I'm sorry,
but when the CIA
wants to learn new dirty tricks,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.659
they observe figure skaters
and their moms.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.861
- Tina, can I have a word?
- Frank, not now.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.264
I want to digitize
some images into my computer

08:53.266 --> 08:56.767
to see if any kind of
unified theory emerges.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.136
Okay, if Gen knows you
and you wanna

08:59.138 --> 09:02.873
press your nose up against
the glass and take a few notes,

09:02.875 --> 09:04.808
I don't really care.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.311
But you're gonna have
a hard sell with the parents.

09:09.614 --> 09:11.615
Absolutely not.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.151
But no one outside of
the scholarship committee

09:14.153 --> 09:16.687
will ever see this program.

09:16.689 --> 09:21.759
Here's the letter
from my teacher
explaining the assignment.

09:21.761 --> 09:25.262
And my driver's license.

09:25.264 --> 09:30.034
Um... I've also got
some letters of references
from people I babysat for.

09:30.036 --> 09:34.104
[Tina] Let's keep
it moving, girls.

09:34.106 --> 09:38.943
It's possible.
We'll have the Team Nikki
legal team check this out.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.316
- [woman] Beautiful, sweetie.
- [girl] Thanks, Mom!

09:45.318 --> 09:48.152
No talking to my daughter.
She's training.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.355
No distraction.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.824
Not a word. No.

09:57.195 --> 09:59.697
Look, I don't care
if you're here.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.633
If you post me on the school
website falling on my butt,

10:02.635 --> 10:05.836
you'd better transfer
to another school.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.005
[Coach] Okay, Nikki.
Let's try that again.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.240
[Tina] Keep it moving.

10:10.242 --> 10:14.378
[Tina] A little wider,
that's it.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.216
Hey! No street shoes
on the ice!

10:22.887 --> 10:26.223
I'm sorry... Sorry.

10:38.336 --> 10:39.837
[boy] Gen!

10:45.777 --> 10:47.344
Hello, hon.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.279
Gen!

10:49.281 --> 10:53.283
Gen! Brian, she's training.
You know the rules.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.086
- I brought a burger, Mrs. H.
- Gen can't eat that.

10:56.088 --> 10:59.890
- Come on, Mom,
I'm burning tons of calories.
- Not enough.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.026
- A half-hour break?
- Not if you wanna win.

11:02.028 --> 11:05.963
You should coach
our basketball team.
We could use a kick in the butt.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.366
If you don't leave this instant,
that's exactly what you'll get.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.840
[Gen] Bye.

11:23.014 --> 11:25.683
I do not want him coming here
during practice.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.186
But I never get to see him.
Every other girl I know...

11:29.188 --> 11:31.155
You're not like the other girls.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.691
Winners make sacrifices.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.392
Maybe they just cheat.

11:38.263 --> 11:40.364
- Turn that off!
- Sorry.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.434
Take it from the layback.

12:06.157 --> 12:08.158
The conclusion's too simplistic.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.027
The kinetic energy in a jump

12:10.029 --> 12:13.263
equals half the skater's mass
times velocity squared, minus...

12:13.265 --> 12:16.033
No, I could barely
understand it.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.434
But...?

12:17.436 --> 12:19.269
I don't know if they'll care

12:19.271 --> 12:22.106
but it's just a little bit...

12:22.108 --> 12:23.841
dry.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.110
Mr. Bast said
I have to make it personal.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.446
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.482
Put more you in it.

12:34.786 --> 12:37.254
Oh, excuse me, Tina.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.491
Is there any way that I could
take a few lessons?

12:40.493 --> 12:44.194
I think I might
be able to write better
about the physics principles

12:44.196 --> 12:46.263
if I'm the one
actually applying them.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.799
- If there's any way I could...
- Fine.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.168
We're starting a novice class
for the summer.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.036
Three afternoons a week.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.972
$800.

12:55.807 --> 12:57.474
$800?

12:57.476 --> 13:00.911
- Popcorn! I want popcorn!
- Where are my Gummi Bears?

13:00.913 --> 13:03.847
- I gave them to you.
- [boy] Four hot dogs!

13:03.849 --> 13:07.117
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- You touched that
with your fingers.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.386
Oh, fine. You don't want
any more? I'll eat it.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.855
Oh, you breathed on it!

13:13.892 --> 13:15.859
You shouldn't work here.

13:18.196 --> 13:20.130
You're here again?

13:20.132 --> 13:24.334
Um... I'm working.
It's for my science project.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.237
Aren't you going a little
overboard with this project?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.206
No, I'm totally committed to it,

13:29.208 --> 13:31.041
like you're committed
to skating.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.876
Whatever. I'm starving.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.012
BLT here.
Hold the B, heavy on the L.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.580
Um... sure.

13:36.582 --> 13:40.951
Beef patty. Squish it
till it's dry. No bun.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.086
- Salad for me.
- Coming up.

13:43.088 --> 13:47.858
Just iceberg lettuce,
half a cup of garbanzos
and a lemon wedge.

13:47.860 --> 13:52.296
Oh, and a quarter cup of cheese.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.164
Ooh, cheese!

13:54.166 --> 13:57.434
It's Saturday.
I can pig out if I want to.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.937
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm popping my Lutz.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.139
It's all that cheese.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.508
Would you shut up?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.343
[Tiffany] I've gotta focus.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.846
I heard Zoey Bloch's
been sticking a quad.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.949
That is a rumor. Which she
probably started herself.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.284
Early in the season
for stupid head games.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.086
[Gen] Not for Zoey.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.554
Food's ready!

14:23.461 --> 14:26.463
That is way more
than a quarter cup.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.266
Um... It's $1.65,

14:29.268 --> 14:31.201
$2.35 and $3.35.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.937
That's $7.30 total. Or if you
split it the other way,

14:33.939 --> 14:36.306
it's $1.75 and $5.55.

14:36.308 --> 14:40.510
Whoa. You can keep it all
if you just stop doing that.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.379
[laughter]

14:43.948 --> 14:45.249
You're welcome.

14:49.487 --> 14:51.121
All right, everybody.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.423
Welcome to our
Snowplow Sam class.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.559
Let's line up.

15:02.934 --> 15:04.601
Lookin' good.

15:07.272 --> 15:12.142
Class, can you tell our
teacher's assistant the most
important rule for this class?

15:12.144 --> 15:14.111
- Mom...
- [all] Never be late.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.547
Right. We have a lot to do

15:17.549 --> 15:21.485
if we are going to be ready
for our recital in August.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.621
We are going to
work on our toe loop.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.993
Our Lutz.

15:34.198 --> 15:35.565
[children gasp]

15:35.567 --> 15:38.669
But first, all of you
have to get comfortable

15:38.671 --> 15:42.239
with throwing
your bodies into the air.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.374
Casey, you're the physics whiz.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.543
What's that rule
about what goes up?

15:46.545 --> 15:49.646
Well, technically, it's that
every particle attracts...

15:49.648 --> 15:51.348
Casey.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.384
Must come down.

15:59.524 --> 16:03.226
This... is your new best friend.

16:17.575 --> 16:20.110
Oh! Oh...

16:20.112 --> 16:22.546
Look, could you try
not to, like, squish me?

16:22.548 --> 16:24.214
I'm sorry.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.083
Casey.
Pull your arms in tighter.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.617
They're throwing you
off balance.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.586
- Arms in.
- Okay.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.055
Now try that
about 5,000 more times.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.625
- Right.
- [Tina] Push over
on your right leg.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.563
[Tina] Don't look at your feet.
Look straight ahead.

16:41.566 --> 16:44.401
Jeremy! That toe pick
is there for a reason!

16:44.403 --> 16:49.106
You dig it in.
Or no friends over for a week.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.408
This is a lot of pressure
for a recital.

16:51.410 --> 16:56.380
It's not only a recital.
It's a U.S.F.S.A.J.S.T.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.115
Earth speak, please?

16:58.117 --> 17:02.586
It's the first step in
qualifying for the regionals.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.489
- I mean for us kids.
- Oh.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.358
- You don't have to do it.
- That's good.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.527
Because it's not
humanly possible.

I'm fine. I'm fine.

what was in your head?

19:01.540 --> 19:04.808
I've never skated on
such a smooth surface before.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.811
I wanted to see
what it was like.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.314
- Lake skater?
- Pond. Near my house.

You must really want that A.

19:32.870 --> 19:36.206
Wow, that's a lot of Styrofoam.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.575
It's not for an A.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.744
It's for a physics scholarship.

19:42.513 --> 19:47.784
What, like, uh... inertia and
drag and velocity and all that?

19:47.786 --> 19:50.287
- How do you know about that?
- I'm into cars.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.390
Get this baby out on the road,
I can open her up to...

19:53.392 --> 19:54.891
seven miles an hour.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.895

street-sweeper in town.

20:06.737 --> 20:09.706
Um... I should get home.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.741
Yeah, you should.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.946
Can't do the ice
until you're off.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.381
Right.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.716
Sure.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.918
Well...

20:36.367 --> 20:38.535
How's it coming?

20:38.537 --> 20:40.437
It's coming.

20:42.273 --> 20:44.407
It takes incredible
training and effort

20:44.409 --> 20:46.710
and there's artistry involved
but I'm sorry,

20:46.712 --> 20:50.280
I just can't get past
the twinky little outfits.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.817
Mom, they're actually
very aerodynamically sound.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.753
It sets us back 50 years.

20:56.755 --> 21:01.324
If I ever saw you squeezed
into one of those things,
I'd probably start crying.

Hello.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.303
This is my video presentation.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.639
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.440
Cut a second.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.542
I sound like
a driver's ed movie.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.279
[Ann] Relax. Do it just
like you're talking to me.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.748
Hey, there. I'm Casey.

21:25.983 --> 21:28.585
Oh, my God.
I forgot my last name.

21:28.587 --> 21:29.819
Can I start over?

21:29.821 --> 21:32.589
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.

21:32.591 --> 21:36.693
I decided to see
if I could make myself prove
my own hypothesis

21:36.695 --> 21:42.432
on the application of physics
to the required elements
of competitive figure skating.

21:44.302 --> 21:47.037
Now, I'm going to increase
the centripetal force

21:47.039 --> 21:49.339
by tucking in my arms.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.875
This will increase
my moment of inertia,

21:51.877 --> 21:54.377
so I will spin...

21:54.379 --> 21:55.779
faster.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.647
I'll increase
the height of my jump

21:57.649 --> 22:00.684
by applying more force
to my toe pick.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.591
- You know, you look kinda hot.
- Shut up.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.627
I'm gonna start off
with a bad one.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.629
For the before shot.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.935
- Yeah, that pretty much blew.
- Okay.

22:18.937 --> 22:22.339
- Now you're making me mad.
- [Ann] Good.

22:46.964 --> 22:48.932
When you sign with Nike,

22:48.934 --> 22:52.068
remember I wear
size six and a half.

22:54.538 --> 22:57.073
I want to do the recital.

22:57.075 --> 22:58.908
For science.

23:00.444 --> 23:03.046
Be here tonight, 5:30.

23:03.981 --> 23:05.648
Okay.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.985
Mm! Tina...

23:08.987 --> 23:11.621
I have this Harvard
alumni tea thing at three.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.556
Then, what are we talking about?

23:13.558 --> 23:16.459
No, it's okay. I'll make it.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.929
Um...

23:19.931 --> 23:22.632
You have nothing to wear.

23:22.634 --> 23:26.436
Come by my house at noon.
Maybe one of my old things
will work for you.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.038
Wow. Okay.

23:33.577 --> 23:34.778
What?

23:36.480 --> 23:37.881
[Casey] Thanks!

23:55.433 --> 23:56.533

23:56.535 --> 23:59.135
- [Mom] Sweetie?
- Just a second!

24:04.975 --> 24:06.042
[knock on door]

24:06.044 --> 24:07.644
Hold on!

24:08.579 --> 24:11.080
- Almost ready?
- Uh-huh.

24:11.082 --> 24:14.984
I have a surprise for you.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.693
That does it.

24:23.695 --> 24:25.061
Perfect.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.831
I think the whole effect
is very grown up,

24:27.833 --> 24:30.767
with a nod to femininity.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.937
We've evolved past flaunting it,
but we don't have to deny it.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.905
I mean, you are
going to be mingling

24:35.907 --> 24:40.176
with your future prospective
classmates and professors,

24:40.178 --> 24:42.612
and I really wanted
the look to say,

24:42.614 --> 24:44.581
"We are serious."

24:44.583 --> 24:47.717
Well, it definitely succeeds.

24:47.719 --> 24:51.754
Mom, we don't have to stay
at this thing for more
than an hour, right?

24:51.756 --> 24:55.258
Um, because... there's
something I have to tell you.

24:55.260 --> 24:59.128
Oh... Oh, honey.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.263
What was that?

25:00.265 --> 25:01.998
I've been so worried.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.867
You've been living at that rink,

25:03.869 --> 25:06.569
but you're here, now.

25:06.571 --> 25:11.241
And you're excited,
because you understand
what's really important.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.610
Look, I've got goose bumps.

25:16.580 --> 25:20.650
I'm sorry, that was so
type A of me. Mom disease.

25:20.652 --> 25:23.553
Just relax.
Just be yourself.

25:23.555 --> 25:26.656
Your normal, poised,
charming, articulate...

25:26.658 --> 25:27.857
Mom...

25:27.859 --> 25:30.660
Do you wanna go over it
one more time?

25:32.096 --> 25:34.931
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle,

25:34.933 --> 25:38.701
and I'm attracted to
the physics program because...

25:38.703 --> 25:40.603
Physics rocks.

25:40.605 --> 25:43.973
In sophomore year, you can join
the Quantum Club and that rocks

25:43.975 --> 25:47.744
because we compete against
Cal Tech, MIT and Stanford.

25:47.746 --> 25:51.147
Last year, our ion particle
accelerator took first place.

25:51.149 --> 25:52.749
It rocked.

25:52.751 --> 25:56.152
Sounds really, um... rockin'.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.054
It is, it really is.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.023
Do you know
what I think is great?

26:00.025 --> 26:02.825
If everything works out
with Casey's scholarship,

26:02.827 --> 26:08.631
I'm sensing that you two will be
spending scads of time together.

26:10.134 --> 26:12.702
Hors d'oeuvre?

26:12.704 --> 26:15.805
Oh, how wonderful, bruschetta.

26:16.807 --> 26:18.942
If you have some time right now,

26:18.944 --> 26:23.046
I'll take you through the entire
physical sciences syllabus.

26:23.048 --> 26:27.884
We have got nothing but time!
Don't we, Case?

26:27.886 --> 26:29.252
Great!

26:31.755 --> 26:34.257
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.226
That's the first rule.

26:40.598 --> 26:44.033
[Tina] All right,
let's get ready. Come on.

26:44.035 --> 26:46.703
- That's what she said...
- I have to do two turns...

26:46.705 --> 26:48.671
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:48.673 --> 26:52.308
We're supposed to go round
the side, remember?

26:52.310 --> 26:56.613
- Oh...
- It's right there.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.082
- Right there, is that better?
- Yeah...

27:08.058 --> 27:10.126
Deep breath.

27:14.031 --> 27:16.165
And then you let it out.

27:16.167 --> 27:19.002
- It didn't work.
- Come on.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.405
Okay, everybody.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.874
[Tina] I'll take that.

- How do they feel?
- I really can't accept these.

59:29.866 --> 59:32.233
Just show me you deserve them.

59:32.235 --> 59:35.002
And we'll need a pair of blades.

59:35.004 --> 59:37.672
I'll have them
sharpened for you right away.

59:37.674 --> 59:40.608
Tina, I can't believe
that you would help...

59:40.610 --> 59:41.976
No fawning.

59:41.978 --> 59:43.611
No.

59:43.613 --> 59:45.212
Just...

59:45.214 --> 59:46.981
Thank you.

59:50.152 --> 59:53.688
[PA]<i> And the next performer</i>
<i>in the Junior Ladies Free Skate</i>

59:53.690 --> 59:56.757
<i>is Casey Carlyle</i>
<i>from Millbrook, Connecticut.</i>

59:56.759 --> 59:59.360
[applause]

1:00:08.770 --> 1:00:12.373
[pop music]

1:00:40.035 --> 1:00:41.636
[crowd] Oh!

1:01:15.837 --> 1:01:18.372
[nervous chatter]

1:01:20.909 --> 1:01:23.177
Who is it?

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:25.179
And that's how it's done, dwarf.

1:01:25.181 --> 1:01:27.748
Shut up, pincushion.

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:29.283
[Nikki's mom] Come on, sweetie.

1:01:29.285 --> 1:01:31.719
Excuse me.

1:01:35.057 --> 1:01:37.892
I'm going to sectionals!

1:01:37.894 --> 1:01:39.260
Good girl!

1:01:39.262 --> 1:01:41.862
Congratulations!

1:01:55.944 --> 1:01:58.112
Are those new?

1:01:59.081 --> 1:02:00.448
- Yeah.
- Are you crazy?

1:02:00.450 --> 1:02:02.917
You can't compete on new skates.

1:02:02.919 --> 1:02:05.953
They take, like, a minimum
of ten days to break in.

1:02:05.955 --> 1:02:08.989
- Everybody knows that.
- But Tina didn't tell me.

1:02:08.991 --> 1:02:11.125
You mean Tina,
whose robot daughter

1:02:11.127 --> 1:02:14.061
almost didn't make sectionals
because of you?

1:02:14.063 --> 1:02:15.996
Typical Tina Harwood.

1:02:15.998 --> 1:02:18.099
Just like Sarajevo.

1:02:19.234 --> 1:02:22.303
You don't know anything, do you?

1:02:22.305 --> 1:02:25.339
They kicked her out.

1:02:25.341 --> 1:02:29.777
You might wanna reconsider
that no-coach thing.

1:02:31.813 --> 1:02:34.014
Bye, new girl.

1:02:34.016 --> 1:02:36.317
[Tina] See you at the van
in 40 minutes.

1:02:36.319 --> 1:02:38.185
[woman] Okay, sure thing.

1:02:41.456 --> 1:02:43.023
There she is.

1:02:43.025 --> 1:02:45.092
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1:02:45.094 --> 1:02:48.796
- You were awesome.
- I am so happy that it's over.

1:02:50.132 --> 1:02:53.501
- Are you happy about my feet?
- What?

1:02:53.503 --> 1:02:57.505
I'm sorry, Casey,
but your old skates were a mess.

1:02:57.507 --> 1:03:00.207
You bought her new skates?

1:03:00.209 --> 1:03:03.210
Please, like you didn't know.

1:03:03.212 --> 1:03:04.945
Casey, I didn't!

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:06.914
How can you lie to my face?

1:03:06.916 --> 1:03:09.316
You're just as bad as she is.

1:03:09.318 --> 1:03:11.218
Hey, ease up, Casey.

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:13.187
Oh, just defend her!

1:03:13.189 --> 1:03:14.822
Like you weren't part of it.

1:03:14.824 --> 1:03:19.193
- How could you think that?
- Because it's true.

1:03:19.195 --> 1:03:23.998
You set me up. All of you.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.467
What kind of people are you?

1:03:35.310 --> 1:03:37.444
Come on, let's go.

1:03:37.446 --> 1:03:39.580
Mom?

1:03:41.149 --> 1:03:43.450
Can you come and get me?

1:03:47.189 --> 1:03:51.225
I'm at the skating rink
at Westerly.

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.962
I want to come home.

1:04:06.942 --> 1:04:10.244
Honey, get in the car.
Just get in the car, honey.

1:04:10.246 --> 1:04:14.048
- How dare you?
- Just hang on, kids.

1:04:14.050 --> 1:04:17.551
You think you can just waltz
away after injuring my daughter?

1:04:17.553 --> 1:04:22.590
- It's Joan, right?
- Pulling her away from
her studies behind my back?

1:04:22.592 --> 1:04:28.596
Filling her head with some
fantasy that she can skate and
sabotaging any chance she had?

1:04:28.598 --> 1:04:34.869
I did you a favor. You didn't
want this for Casey and you're
right. She's not cut our for it.

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:37.471
Is she gifted?
I'll give her that.

1:04:37.473 --> 1:04:41.208
But Casey will never fight
for it. She's too polite
to do what you have to do.

1:04:41.210 --> 1:04:45.346
To push past everyone and
everything and just take it.

1:04:45.348 --> 1:04:50.618
So that's the example
you set for your daughter.

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:54.555
To lie and to sneak around
and to cheat.

1:04:58.493 --> 1:05:04.231
I made my daughter strong,
and you made Casey at home
in a lecture hall.

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:08.202
And she'll do very well there.
So you see, we agree.

1:05:08.204 --> 1:05:13.140
My daughter's brilliant and will
succeed at whatever she does.

1:05:13.142 --> 1:05:20.080
But she will do it the right way
despite people like you trying
to convince her otherwise.

1:06:03.058 --> 1:06:05.960
Casey!

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:09.096
- I'm in good shape.
I can keep up with you.
- Go away.

1:06:09.098 --> 1:06:12.232
- Casey, I didn't know!
- Right!

1:06:15.503 --> 1:06:21.141
Where have you been?
You are aware you had practice
half an hour ago?

1:06:21.143 --> 1:06:24.511
- Yes, I'm aware.
- And?

1:06:24.513 --> 1:06:27.014
And I'm done.

1:06:30.251 --> 1:06:32.586
Done?

1:06:39.627 --> 1:06:45.099
- I'm quitting.
- You've got to be kidding.
That's ridiculous.

1:06:45.101 --> 1:06:49.436
No, I was ridiculous for putting
myself through this for so long.

1:06:49.438 --> 1:06:51.572
We both know
I don't have the talent.

1:06:51.574 --> 1:06:55.642
Perseverance is nine tenths
of mastering any sport.

1:06:55.644 --> 1:07:00.381
Do you know what I want?
No, you don't know what I want.

1:07:00.383 --> 1:07:03.417
Because you never cared.

1:07:06.521 --> 1:07:10.457
If you have any sense of self
preservation, you'll scatter.

1:07:13.495 --> 1:07:15.596
[muttering]

1:07:19.134 --> 1:07:24.538
- I'm listening.
- I wanna stop missing school.
I like school.

1:07:24.540 --> 1:07:28.575
You know, it's stupid and the
band will probably be horrible,

1:07:28.577 --> 1:07:32.679
but I wanna go to
the homecoming dance.

1:07:32.681 --> 1:07:35.682
And I wanna go with Brian.

1:07:35.684 --> 1:07:42.523
I want to stop feeling an idiot
for flunking math because
I don't have time to learn it.

1:07:44.125 --> 1:07:47.628
- And I want...
- All right. All right.

1:07:47.630 --> 1:07:52.132
- I can see that
maybe we've overdone it.
- Overdone it?

1:07:53.535 --> 1:07:55.836
Just a little.

1:07:55.838 --> 1:07:58.338
Casey's skates, Mom.

1:08:00.442 --> 1:08:02.443
[bell]

1:08:05.647 --> 1:08:08.082
We'll continue this discussion
at home.

1:08:29.704 --> 1:08:33.674
- You heard the whole thing?
- Yeah.

1:08:37.812 --> 1:08:39.646
Are you okay?

1:08:42.350 --> 1:08:48.322
It's your slot, Casey.
If I drop out, you're next.

1:08:48.324 --> 1:08:50.624
You'll go to sectionals.

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:53.460
No.

1:08:53.462 --> 1:08:57.865
Thanks.
Tomorrow's my Harvard interview.

1:08:57.867 --> 1:09:02.402
That's my slot.
That's what I should be doing.

1:09:02.404 --> 1:09:04.705
You sure about that?

1:09:14.415 --> 1:09:17.818
It's a nice little experiment.

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:22.923
In what way do you think
a triple loop jump entitles you
to a physics scholarship?

1:09:22.925 --> 1:09:30.531
Dr. Healey, the proof of the
experiment isn't in the mumbo
jumbo of the calculations.

1:09:30.533 --> 1:09:35.369
It's in the improvement
in the skating
of three junior champions.

1:09:35.371 --> 1:09:41.275
I also applied the findings
to my own skating and...

1:09:43.778 --> 1:09:48.715
and actually managed to
implement the experiment

1:09:48.717 --> 1:09:54.254
in a very rewarding
and entirely personal way.

1:09:54.256 --> 1:09:59.426
Well, good, because
passion is a key component
of what we look for in students.

1:09:59.428 --> 1:10:02.663
Passion makes people go on
to do exceptional things.

1:10:02.665 --> 1:10:08.735
So, Casey, why are you
passionate about Harvard?

1:10:22.817 --> 1:10:29.690
Dr. Healey, my mom and I
have been imagining Harvard
practically my whole life.

1:10:32.227 --> 1:10:37.698
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but what I need to be doing,

1:10:40.368 --> 1:10:42.002
I can't do here.

1:10:42.004 --> 1:10:45.305
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

1:10:47.508 --> 1:10:49.610
I'm so sorry.

1:10:54.415 --> 1:10:59.353
Miss Carlyle,
we won't reschedule.

1:11:00.555 --> 1:11:02.656
I know.

1:11:14.836 --> 1:11:20.407
You can't do this, Case.
You're giving up your dream.

1:11:20.409 --> 1:11:24.645
No, Mom,
I'm giving up your dream.

1:11:27.015 --> 1:11:29.449
I'm going after mine.

1:12:04.519 --> 1:12:06.687
[shrieks]

1:12:44.926 --> 1:12:48.729
- How did you know?
- Didn't think you'd give up.

1:12:48.731 --> 1:12:52.099
Which meant you'd be out here
bumping it out.

1:12:52.101 --> 1:12:57.037
Teddy, I've been trying to find
some way to apologize.

1:12:57.039 --> 1:13:00.107
I've got some ideas about that.

1:13:00.109 --> 1:13:02.809
Medium smooth or glassy?

1:13:46.821 --> 1:13:54.027
I can't have a conversation
with anybody I haven't known
since kindergarten,

1:13:54.029 --> 1:13:57.164
so how come I can do that
in front of you?

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.668
Because you let people see you
when you skate.

1:14:04.472 --> 1:14:08.742
But, Casey,
you can't win going it alone.

1:14:08.744 --> 1:14:11.011
You're gonna need some help.

1:14:24.992 --> 1:14:27.461
[doorbell]

1:14:37.638 --> 1:14:39.506
What do you want?

1:14:39.508 --> 1:14:41.575
Five minutes.

1:14:42.543 --> 1:14:45.078
You owe me that much.

1:14:51.052 --> 1:14:54.654
If you're here for an apology,
you won't get one.

1:14:54.656 --> 1:14:57.023
I'm not here for an apology.

1:14:57.025 --> 1:15:00.827
Tell me what happened
in Sarajevo.

1:15:00.829 --> 1:15:02.929
Why didn't you win?

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:08.969
I had an unfortunate warm-up
before my short program.

1:15:08.971 --> 1:15:12.873
I collided with another skater
and she got hurt.

1:15:12.875 --> 1:15:15.675
Are you sorry?

1:15:17.578 --> 1:15:22.949
Look, I paid my dues.
I was suspended.

1:15:22.951 --> 1:15:28.021
By the time
they considered reinstating me,
I was 26 and it was too late.

1:15:28.023 --> 1:15:35.729
But there isn't a day goes by
that I don't wish
I could relive that moment

1:15:35.731 --> 1:15:37.697
and do it differently.

1:15:43.037 --> 1:15:45.305
I want you to coach me
for sectionals.

1:15:48.809 --> 1:15:51.745
Why on earth would I do that?

1:15:51.747 --> 1:15:55.649
Because you don't have a skater
and I don't have a coach.

1:15:55.651 --> 1:15:59.152
- We're a perfect match.
- I don't think
you have what it takes.

1:16:01.589 --> 1:16:04.958
Tina, I have to do this.

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:07.661
I want this more than
I've ever wanted anything.

1:16:09.630 --> 1:16:11.765
I said no to Harvard.

1:16:13.301 --> 1:16:16.603
I will work harder than any
skater you have ever trained.

1:16:16.605 --> 1:16:19.105
And if I fail, I fail,

1:16:19.107 --> 1:16:23.143
but because I wasn't good
enough, not because
I didn't have the guts.

1:16:23.145 --> 1:16:29.082
I want to know
what I can do in this sport,
and I'm going to find out.

1:16:41.996 --> 1:16:47.200
The rink. Tomorrow, 5:30 am,
and get a good night's sleep.

1:16:47.202 --> 1:16:49.736
You're gonna need it.

1:16:56.277 --> 1:17:01.748
That you'd even consider letting
that woman back into your head!

1:17:01.750 --> 1:17:03.984
I don't have to like her
or trust her.

1:17:03.986 --> 1:17:06.987
No, you just wanna spend
all your time with her.

1:17:06.989 --> 1:17:10.690
- I'm not gonna turn into her.
- She's already rubbed off
on you.

1:17:10.692 --> 1:17:15.161
- That's not true.
- Where did this hair come from?
And the make-up? And that shirt?

1:17:15.163 --> 1:17:17.797
I did not buy you that shirt.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.766
That has nothing to do with it.

1:17:19.768 --> 1:17:21.768
I think you wanna be
exactly like her,

1:17:21.770 --> 1:17:24.070
and if you happen to
lie now and again,

1:17:24.072 --> 1:17:27.040
well, hey,
at least you'll be glamorous.

1:17:27.042 --> 1:17:29.976
You think this is about glamour?

1:17:29.978 --> 1:17:34.214
It is a sport, Mom. It is a
thrilling and beautiful sport.

1:17:34.216 --> 1:17:38.018
Are you sure it doesn't
just make you feel beautiful?

1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:39.919
So what if it does?

1:17:39.921 --> 1:17:42.022
What is so horrible about that?

1:17:42.024 --> 1:17:47.260
About feeling strong and
graceful and beautiful
for once in my life?

1:17:52.433 --> 1:17:55.068
Why are you jealous of her?

1:17:56.971 --> 1:18:00.140
Well, I guess
no matter how old we get,

1:18:00.142 --> 1:18:02.876
the rest of us will still
always hate the prom queen.

1:18:09.984 --> 1:18:14.387
You know it'll always be
the Casey and Mom show.

1:18:16.457 --> 1:18:18.458
Do I?

1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:22.929
But if you could just
come to the rink and see me.

1:18:22.931 --> 1:18:25.899
Don't ask me! I can't!

1:18:25.901 --> 1:18:28.868
Come with me right now. Mom.

1:18:28.870 --> 1:18:34.040
Just come watch me skate, and
then tell me that I should stop.

1:18:34.042 --> 1:18:36.976
You know what,
I have a class, all right?

1:18:49.490 --> 1:18:54.961
[commentator] Welcome to ESPN
at the Eastern Sectional
Junior Ladies' Short Program.

1:18:54.963 --> 1:19:00.467
I have to say, from the
practice sessions I've seen,
these ladies are fired up.

1:19:00.469 --> 1:19:04.738
That's right, Brian,
every skater has worked
unbelievably hard to get here.

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:08.074
And every one of them
is ready to compete.

1:19:15.316 --> 1:19:17.350
[cheering]

1:19:23.124 --> 1:19:26.259
So, are you a science geek too?

1:19:26.261 --> 1:19:28.328
Math geek.

1:19:28.330 --> 1:19:34.334

[Michelle] Tiffany is probably
the most graceful, artistic
skater in this competition,

and she's definitely on today.

1:20:29.424 --> 1:20:33.927

Chantal was showing
signs of nerves earlier.

Not any more. She's in total
command out there.

1:20:39.967 --> 1:20:43.236
[Brian] Fans call her
the Jumping Shrimp
but remember that name

1:20:43.238 --> 1:20:47.173

has been landing massive jumps.

No "good job" or "way to go"?

- At least I landed the jumps.
- You're in the game, no more.

1:21:24.613 --> 1:21:27.914
I'm not seeing much fluidity
coming out of your jumps

1:21:27.916 --> 1:21:30.250
