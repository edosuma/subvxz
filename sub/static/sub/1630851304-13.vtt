00:27.660 --> 00:31.264
>> Announcer: AND MOST OF HIS
TEAM WANTED TO TARGET WHITNEY

00:31.331 --> 00:32.165
AND HANNAH.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.600
>> WHITNEY IS GOING UP FOR SURE.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.902
>> OKAY, SO THE QUESTION IS WHO
GOES NEXT TO HER.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.537
>> IT HAS GOT TO BE HANNAH.

00:37.604 --> 00:41.741

X-ZAVIER IN A TOUGH SMOT BECAUSE

00:41.808 --> 00:43.643
HE WAS IN THE COOKOUT ALLIANCE.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.511
>> HANNA IS MY BABY SISTER IN
THE GAME, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE

00:44.577 --> 00:45.345
COOKOUT.

00:45.412 --> 00:49.682
IT PUTS ME IN A VERY TRICKY
SITUATION.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.785
>> Announcer: WHEN SARAH BETH
PUSHES TO MAKE HANNAH THE

00:51.851 --> 00:56.890
TARGET, THE COOKOUT CAME TO HER
DEFENSE.

00:56.956 --> 00:58.124
>> HANNAH IS.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.593
>> THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE MORE
OF A THREAT TO BOTH OF OUR TEAMS

01:00.660 --> 01:03.229
AND THAT IS BRITINI.

01:03.296 --> 01:07.400
>> Announcer: SETTING OFF
ALARM BELLS WITH SARAH BETH.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.769
>> I'M SO FRUSTRATED THAT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN MY ALLIANCE

01:09.836 --> 01:12.872
DON'T SEE HANNAH AS THE TARGET
SHE IS.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.073
HUGE RED FLAG.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.309
I GET THAT YOU ARE THINKING
ABOUT JURY AND THINK BEING VOTES

01:16.376 --> 01:18.478
BUT I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT
MAKING IT THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

01:18.545 --> 01:22.215
>> Announcer: WHICH PUT HER
ON TIFFANY'S RADAR.

01:22.282 --> 01:27.887
>> SHE NEEDS TO BE OUT OF THE
HOUSE.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.390
Z AFTER CHRISTIAN PUT TWO ACES
ON THE BLOCK.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.293
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU, WHITNEY
AND YOU HANNAH.

01:33.359 --> 01:38.465
>> Announcer: THE POWER OF
VETO WAS UP FOR GRABS.

01:38.531 --> 01:43.670

VETO.

02:00.086 --> 02:03.156
>> Announcer: TONIGHT WILL
THE COOKOUT SUCCEED IN

02:03.223 --> 02:05.925
PROTECTING HANNAH AND SENDING
WHITNEY HOME?

02:05.992 --> 02:09.229
PLUS THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING IN
TEAMS SINCE NIGHT ONE.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.898
BUT ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

02:11.965 --> 02:16.035
AND AN EPIC BATTLE OF ENDURANCE
BEGINS.

02:16.102 --> 02:23.910
ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG BROTHER"!

02:23.977 --> 02:32.118
>> OH NO, OH NO.

02:35.955 --> 02:47.967
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M

03:05.985 --> 03:11.024
JULY YEEN-- JULIE QUHEN MOONVES,
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER" LAST

03:11.090 --> 03:15.862
WEEK A PLOT TO TAKE DOWN THE
DOMINANT KINGS TEAM WAS FOILED

03:15.929 --> 03:19.265
WHEN KISSIAN ROSE TO POWER
MAKING THE KINGS THE ONLY TEAM

03:19.332 --> 03:21.968
TO SURVIVE WITH ALL FOUR MEMBERS
STILL IN TACT.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.938
BUT WITH THE TEAM TWIST ENDING
TONIGHT STRATEGIES WILL BE

03:25.004 --> 03:29.208
FORCED TO SHIFT AND ALLIANCES
WILL BE TESTED WHEN THE

03:29.275 --> 03:32.078
HOUSEGUESTS LEARN THAT THEY ARE
COMPLETELY ON THEIR OWN.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.515
WE'LL GIVE THEM THE BIG NEWS
LATER TONIGHT.

03:35.582 --> 03:41.287
BUT FIRST 30 DAYS IN AND THE
CHESS GAME THAT IS "BIG BROTHER"

03:41.354 --> 03:43.389
KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR.

03:43.456 --> 03:51.798
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

03:51.864 --> 03:55.468
>> NOW THERE IS NO POSSIBLE
CHANCE FOR ANY OF MY NOMINEES TO

03:55.535 --> 03:56.636
COME OFF THE BLOCK.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.271
WHITNEY COULD DO ONE-ON-ONES
TODAY OR TOMORROW OR WHENEVER

03:58.338 --> 03:59.372
SHE WANTS TO DO.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.140
IT IS REALLY NOT GOING TO CHANGE
MY MIND.

04:01.207 --> 04:05.912
I HOPE THE HOUSE SEES THAT
WHITNEY IS THE TARGET SO IT IS A

04:05.979 --> 04:07.380
UNANIMOUS VOTE.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.081
>> I'M SORRY.

04:08.147 --> 04:08.881
>> I GET IT.

04:08.948 --> 04:13.586
>> I KNOW I HAVE THE COOKOUT'S
VOTES.

04:13.653 --> 04:19.292
I ALSO KNOW HAVE I DEREK X'S
VOTE SO I HAVE THE NUMBERS BUT

04:19.359 --> 04:26.899
MI WORRIED THAT PEOPLE ARE
STARTING TO CATCH GLIMPSES OF

04:26.966 --> 04:30.069
HOW I PROCESS INFORMATION AND
HOW ANALYTICAL I CAN BE, THIS

04:30.136 --> 04:33.539
EARLY IN THE GAME YOU DON'T WANT
ALL EYES TO BE ON YOU.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.441
>> I DON'T TALK TO HANNAH VERY
MUCH.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.444
WHICH CAN WHY I WANTED FOR HER
TO GO THIS WEEK.

04:38.511 --> 04:42.315
BUT I HAVE SAID MY PEACE ABOUT
THIS, BEING THE KING, AND I

04:42.382 --> 04:44.083
DON'T WANT TO PAINT A BIG TARGET
ON PIE BACK.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.920
SO I'M JUST GOING TO SIT BACK
AND LET WHATEVER HAPPENS THIS

04:47.987 --> 04:49.656
WEEK HAPPEN.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.025
>> I FEEL LIKE THE BIGGER THREAT
IS HANNAH.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.894
HANNAH HAS FRIENDSHIPS WITH
ALMOST EVERYBODY.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.363
IS INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT AND
SHE'S REALLY GOOD AT

04:57.430 --> 04:59.499
MANIPULATING AND GETTING IN
PEOPLE'S HEADS.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.468
SO I'M REALLY HOPING THAT I WILL
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO

05:02.535 --> 05:05.905
PEOPLE AND LET THEM KNOW THAT I
DO THINK IT'S SMARTER TO KEEP

05:05.972 --> 05:06.506
ME.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.074
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

05:08.141 --> 05:21.320
>> GOOD LUCK YOU GUYS.

05:21.387 --> 05:25.291
>> OUT OF EVERYONE IN THE
COOKOUT I FEEL THE CLOSEST TO

05:25.358 --> 05:26.559
HANNAH.

05:26.626 --> 05:32.065
WE THINK ALIKE IN THIS GAME AND
WE EVEN KIND OF MADE A FINAL TWO

05:32.131 --> 05:33.533
TOGETHER.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.836
>> LET'S PLAY A GAME.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.873
I KEEP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO
I COULD GO CLOSEST TO.

05:40.940 --> 05:47.013
WHO I CONNECT WITH, WHO CAN I
TALK TO.

05:47.080 --> 06:00.893
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.932
>> JUST AN AMAZING YOUNG WOMAN,
I WANT US TO REALLY GO FOR IN

06:05.998 --> 06:11.070
THIS GAME.

06:11.137 --> 06:16.075
>> I COULD JUST BE CREATING MY
OBSERVE PROBLEM.

06:16.142 --> 06:29.922
-- .

06:29.989 --> 06:31.357
>> HANNAH SHOULD DEFINITELY BE
SAFE THIS WEEK.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.627
SHE IS SUPPORTED BY THE COOKOUT
AND WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

06:34.694 --> 06:48.841
BUT SARAH BETH IS ACTIVELY
COMING FOR HER.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.276
>> CAN I JOIN YOU.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.844
>> YES.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.679
>> OF COURSE.

06:53.746 --> 06:58.384
>> SHE'S OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO SPY
ON US.

06:58.451 --> 07:08.427
>> SARAH BETH, OH SARAH BETH.

07:08.494 --> 07:17.470
>> SARAH BETH, OH SARAH BETH.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.005
>> MORE SCARED THAN YOU NEED TO
BE.

07:19.071 --> 07:25.678
>> THE ONLY THING I ASK IS THAT
WHOEVER STAYS, CAN HELP ME NOT

07:25.745 --> 07:28.080
GET ATTACKED BY THEM.

07:28.147 --> 07:29.949
>> DON'T THROW ME UNDER THE BUS.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.083
>> ABSOLUTELY.

07:31.150 --> 07:35.922
>> AND IF YOU HEAR PEOPLE
THROWING ME UNDER THE BUS, LET

07:35.988 --> 07:40.960
ME KNOW.

07:41.027 --> 07:45.097
>> KYLAND IS THE ONLY PERSON I'M
LOYAL TO IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

07:45.164 --> 07:53.039
I CONNECTED WITH KYLAND RIGHT
AWAY SO ON DAY TWO I FORMED THE

07:53.105 --> 07:56.075
TOO SWEET ALLIANCE WITH HIM.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.312
>> COMING IN THIS GAME I WANT TO
FIND ONE OTHER PERSON THAT I

07:59.378 --> 08:01.013
REALLY TRUST, YOU KNOW.

08:01.080 --> 08:01.981
>> UH-HUH.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.517
>> AND IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.386
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT WITH
YOU.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.688
DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

08:08.754 --> 08:14.861
>> NO, I WOULD LOVE THAT, I
REALLY WOULD.

08:14.927 --> 08:16.128
>> OKAY.

08:16.195 --> 08:20.066
>> NOT ONLY DO I FEEL LIKE HE'S
A GREAT ALLY FOR MY GAME, HE IS

08:20.132 --> 08:25.938
ALSO JUST A FRIEND.

08:26.005 --> 08:32.078
I DON'T CARE IF SHE GOES TO JURY
BUT-- .

08:32.144 --> 08:37.683
>> YOU WILL HAVE TO SAY,NESS
WITH YOU WILL REGRET THAT I KNOW

08:37.750 --> 08:38.417
WHAT MI DOING.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.052
>> I WILL JUST BE LIKE.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.288
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SARAH
BETH IS AWESOME.

08:42.355 --> 08:48.394
I LOVE HANGING OUT WITH HER AND
WE GET ALONG PHENOMENALLY WELL,

08:48.461 --> 08:51.898
THAT BEING SAID IF THERE WAS
EVER A CHOICE BETWEEN A COOKOUT

08:51.964 --> 08:54.634
AND SARAH BETH, I WOULD HAVE
CHOOSE THE COOKOUT.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.270
>> ARE YOU ONE OF THE PEOPLE
THAT DOES OTHER THINGS SO YOU

08:57.336 --> 08:59.472
DON'T GET ASKED TO DO IT AGAIN.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.007
>> THAT IS SO RUDE, NEVER.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.341
>> YES, OFTEN.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.510
>> I HAVE NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY
MIND.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.379
>> GOT IT.

09:06.445 --> 09:19.725
OH MY GOSH.

09:19.792 --> 09:26.933
>> THE COOKOUT IS IN AGREEMENT
MADE BETWEEN KYLAND, MYSELF,

09:26.999 --> 09:30.636
X-ZAVIER, HANNAH, AZAH AND-- TO
ENSURE WE ARE NOT TARGET EACH

09:30.703 --> 09:33.039
OTHER HOWEVER AT THE END OF THE
DAY WE ARE ONLY SIX.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.042
AND WE NEED A FEW MORE NUMBERS
TO HELP US GET THROUGH TO THE

09:36.108 --> 09:40.246
END OF THIS GAME.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.948
>> HOW MANY IS THERE.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.988
>> WHAT DOES ELEVEN MAKE.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.189
>>.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.491
>> I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO GET
THE SIX OF US TO JURY, I WOULD

09:52.558 --> 09:57.296
ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE TWO MEMBERS
OF THE COOKOUT IN THE FINAL.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.266
>> IF US SECRETARIES STRAIGHT
DOWN THE MIDDLE EACH PLAYING.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.103
>> WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH
SOMEONE ELSE OUTSIDE OF THE SIX

10:04.170 --> 10:07.306
SO THAT WE DON'T BRING ATTENTION
TO OURSELVES.

10:07.373 --> 10:13.112
AND WE WILL ALSO APPEAR AS
A-- TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

10:13.179 --> 10:14.280
HOUSE.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.548
THAT NOT ONLY HELPS US GET
FURTHER IN THE GAME, BUT IF ONE

10:15.614 --> 10:19.018
OF THE DUOS ENDS UP IN THE BLOCK
TOGETHER, THE COOK OWRT HAS THE

10:19.085 --> 10:25.358
NUMBERS TO HELP US STAY SAFE.

10:25.424 --> 10:29.895
>> YOU HAVE CHRISTIAN,YOU HAVE
DEREK X.

10:29.962 --> 10:42.141
I HAVE-- .

10:42.208 --> 10:45.478
>> SARAH BETH IS THE ONLY PERSON
THAT I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IN

10:45.544 --> 10:47.947
THIS PLAN BECAUSE SHE'S COMING
AFTER HANNAH.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.816
BUT BECAUSE OF HER AND KY'S
RELATIONSHIP, WE MATE AS WELL

10:50.883 --> 10:56.055
INCLUDE HER IN THE PLAN FOR NOW.

10:56.122 --> 11:06.098
>> AFTER JURY-- WE COULD DO IT
LIKE THIS.

11:06.165 --> 11:11.470
>> AFTER JURY-- WE COULD DO IT
LIKE THIS.

11:11.537 --> 11:12.271
I LOVE THAT.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.941
I LOVE THAT, ANYBODY GETS A
CHANCE.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.943
>> EVERYBODY GETS A PERSON.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.845
>> TIFFANY HAS AN INCREDIBLY
WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.948
THE BEST THING ABOUT THE COOKOUT
IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE

11:23.015 --> 11:29.955
DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN ALL OF US,
WE ALL STILL PLAY OUR INDIVIDUAL

11:30.022 --> 11:32.024
GAME.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.795
>> WE ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.397
>> SIX AND FIVE TO JURY, RIGHT.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.465
>> UH-HUH.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.601
>> THE ONLY WAY TO GET JURY
IS.

11:42.668 --> 11:47.673
>> STAY IN GOOD COMMUNE KAITION
AND KEEP THEM IN OUR BACK

11:47.740 --> 11:48.674
POCKET.

11:48.741 --> 11:49.909
>> I'M GLAD EVERYONE IS ON BOARD
WITH THIS PLAN.

11:49.975 --> 11:54.313
NOW THAT HAND HANNAH IS ON THE
BLOCK THE COOKOUT NEEDS TO SAVE

11:54.380 --> 11:56.348
HER AND WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO
DO THAT THAT IS JUST ONE MORE

11:56.415 --> 11:58.117
STEP FROM OUR PLAN BEING IN
MOTION.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.954
>> WE NEED TO MAKE UP OUR JURY
AND THEN WE DETERMINE THE ORDER

12:02.021 --> 12:03.055
IN WHICH THEY LEAVE.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.759
>> THEN AFTER THAT WE DIAL IT
UP.

12:06.826 --> 12:11.330
>> WE DIAL IT UP.

12:11.397 --> 12:17.236
>> Julie: UP NEXT THINGS
AMONGST THE COOKOUT GET HEATED.

12:17.303 --> 12:20.072
THEN HANNAH OR WHITNEY, TIME TO
SEND ANOTHER HOUSEGUEST HOME,

12:20.139 --> 12:23.676
PLUS IT'S TIME TO CROWN A NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AS THE

12:23.742 --> 12:27.046
SUMMER'S FIRST BATTLE OF
ENDURANCE BEGINS.

12:27.113 --> 12:27.980
STAY WITH US.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.163
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER," AS TIFFANY LOOKS AHEAD

12:44.230 --> 12:50.769
IN THE GAME, WHITNEY GOES
LOOKING FOR VOTES.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.139
>> DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE-- WALK
DO YOU.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.140
>> VIDEO GAME WALK.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.841
>> EVERYONE IS OUT HERE TRYING
TO LEARN THE WALK.

12:55.908 --> 13:02.815
>> IT IS JUST A SIMPLE WELCOME
TO, BOO BOO, THE HIPS, LEFT TO

13:02.882 --> 13:03.382
RIGHT.

13:03.449 --> 13:08.420

13:08.487 --> 13:17.229
PUTS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE, HE
WALKS UP AND GOES-- HIP ACTION.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.365
AND I WANT TO LEARN IT.

13:19.431 --> 13:22.701
>> YOU MOVE YOUR HANDS DON'T
MOVE YOUR SHOULDERS.

13:22.768 --> 13:23.969
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.804
>> MOVING YOUR ELBOWS, ELBOWS
ARE LOOSE.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.173
>> THIS MAN IS STRAIGHT.

13:27.239 --> 13:35.214
>> THERE YOU GO.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.115
>> OH.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.550
>> OH MY GOD.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.852
CHRISTIAN IS REALLY TRYING TO DO
MY WALK RIGHT NOW.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.188
AND IT'S A HOT ASS MESS.

13:42.254 --> 13:43.856
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.424
HE LOOKS LIKE A ZOMBIE.

13:45.491 --> 13:49.628
HE HAS TOO LEFT FEE AND NO
RHYTHM.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.163
>> OH MY GOD.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.733
>> WHY IS YOUR NECK STUCK
OUTLINING THAT.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.768
>> CHRISTIAN, DO THE WALK.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.771
>> OH, OH, I HEARD YOU KILLING
THE WALK.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.673
>> WELCOME TO.

14:00.739 --> 14:01.740
>> IT'S SO ROBOTIC.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.842
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE NO FLOW IN
YOUR HIPS.

14:03.909 --> 14:04.777
>> I KNOW.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.979
>> WHY ARE YOUR HIPS SO.

14:07.046 --> 14:11.584
>> YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE A ROBOT,
GLITCHING AS IT IS LEARNING TO

14:11.650 --> 14:13.619
WALK FOR THE FIRST TIME.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.655
YOU HAVE A LITTLE SWAG
LIKE-- BUT HIS WALK IS CORNY AS

14:16.722 --> 14:18.290
HELL.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.725
>> FLOW IT, FLOW IT.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.759
>> PRETTY GOOD, MAN.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.796
>> THERE YOU GO.

14:23.862 --> 14:24.730
>> WORK.

14:24.797 --> 14:30.436
>> YES, GET IT IT IT'S NO
UNNATURAL.

14:30.502 --> 14:36.542
>> WHY IS IT SO UNNATURAL.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.177
>> I THINK I HAD.

14:38.244 --> 14:43.382
>> I WAS LIKE MATTHEW
MCCONAUGHEY.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.717
>> NOW I'M DOUBTING, I DON'T
KNOW.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.486
>> SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.621
>> GOOD MORNING.

14:48.687 --> 14:52.725
>> YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME OTHER
MOVIES.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.726
>> GOOD MORNING.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.461
>> THAT'S MY LAST TIME SAYING
GOOD MORNING.

14:55.527 --> 15:00.833
I SAID GOOD MORNING TO ALL THREE
OF Y'ALL AND AIN'T NOBODY SAID

15:00.899 --> 15:01.233
NOTHING.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.101
Y'ALL SO RUDE.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.369
>> WHAT?

15:03.435 --> 15:06.672
>> I AM COMING INTO THE HALLWAY,
I SEE THREE PEOPLE, I SPEAK, NO

15:06.739 --> 15:07.473
ONE SAYS ANYTHING.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.175
I SPEAK AGAIN, NO ONE SAYS
ANYTHING.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.413
AND I'M LIKE OKAY, IT'S COOL BUT
I REALLY JUST SAID GOOD MORNING.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.815
>> SORRY THAT I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.316
>> GOOD MORNING.

15:17.383 --> 15:17.716
>> GOOD MORNING.

15:17.783 --> 15:18.317
>> THANK YOU.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.853
>> YOU FINALLY SAID IT IT.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.422
>> I WAS GOING SAY IT THEN YOU
STARTED YELLING AT ME WHEN I

15:23.489 --> 15:24.690
TRIED TO YELL.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.959
>> MY VOICE HAS BEEN THE SAME.

15:27.026 --> 15:31.864
>> I'M SORRY.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.032
>> CLEARLY I'M INTENTIONAL.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.970
>> IT IS JUST, YOU KNOW T IS
VERY OFF-PUTTING IF YOU ENTER

15:38.037 --> 15:41.407
AND YOU SPEAK AN NO ONE SAYS
ANYTHING.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.609
IT BECOMES A LITTLE ANNOYING.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.978
I WASN'T RAISED LIKE THAT, I
TELL YOU THAT.

15:46.045 --> 15:50.215
>> AS FAR AS I, I LOOK FOR HEY,
IT IS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.618
I DON'T WANT TO BLAME ANYBODY, I
WANT TO SOLVE IT.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.220
>> THEY'RE JUST GOOF BALLS.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.558
>> IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO
FEEL-- I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

15:59.625 --> 16:00.659
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

16:00.726 --> 16:01.794
>> SO IT IS NOT FULLY YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY AND IT IS NOT

16:01.860 --> 16:03.095
SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
RESOLVE IT.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.497
>> I FEEL LIKE KYLAND SHOULD LET
THE SITUATION GO.

16:05.564 --> 16:10.436
BUT HE WANTED TO DEFEND OTHER
PEOPLE IN C THEY DIDN'T ADDRESS

16:10.502 --> 16:11.904
THE GOOD MORNING.

16:11.970 --> 16:19.578
AND I ASSUMED IT WAS ONLY
BECAUSE IT IT WAS SARAH BETH.

16:19.645 --> 16:26.685
THE FACT THAT KYLAND IS COMING
TO SARAH BETH'S DEFENSE LEADS ME

16:26.752 --> 16:31.290
TO WHY THEIR CONNECTION COULD
BECOME PROBLEMATIC IN THE

16:31.357 --> 16:32.491
FUTURE.

16:32.558 --> 16:38.330
>> WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT, IT
MAKES ME QUESTION IF THAT IS

16:38.397 --> 16:39.865
TRUE.

16:39.932 --> 16:44.370
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND
KYLAND AND CLAIRE.

16:44.436 --> 16:54.780
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WE MAKE
AN AGREEMENT, WITH JOKERS F ONE

16:54.847 --> 17:02.321
OF US LEFT WE VAN AGREEMENT TO
PUT ONE PAWN, AND PUT UP ONE

17:02.388 --> 17:08.861
KING, IF A KING WINS VETO AND
GOES DOWN PUT UP ANOTHER KING IN

17:08.927 --> 17:15.501
ITS PLACE, SO A KING IS
GUARANTEED TO GO HOME.

17:15.567 --> 17:20.139
>> I THINK THAT'S REALLY.

17:20.205 --> 17:24.243
>> I MEAN AT THIS POINT THE ACES
GOING TO LOSE THEY WILL COME

17:24.309 --> 17:28.414
AFTER US AND A REASON TO COME
AFTER KINGS SO I DON'T REALLY

17:28.480 --> 17:31.183
FEEL SAFE.

17:31.250 --> 17:36.955
>> YOU REALIZE-- IS PART OF THE
KINGS, RIGHT.

17:37.022 --> 17:39.658
>> I DON'T TRUST HER.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.895
>> SHE WILL COME AFTER US.

17:42.961 --> 17:46.331
>> IN SEEMS TO BE, YOU KNOW, A
TRUST LEVEL THAT TIFFANY HAS

17:46.398 --> 17:49.635
WITH HANNAH BUT I HONESTLY CAN'T
SAY I TRUST HANNAH BECAUSE WE

17:49.701 --> 17:50.903
DON'T TALK GAME TO EACH OTHER.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.305
NOW I KNOW I CAN'T TELL TIFFANY
EVERYTHING.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.408
>> I DEFINITELY WANT HER AND I
HAVE HER BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE.

17:56.475 --> 18:04.116
BUT I DON'T TRUST.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.452
>> I THOUGHT I WAS THE FIVE PLUS
HANNAH.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.988
>> I'M CLOSE TO HANNAH BECAUSE
WE HAVE THE SAME IDEAS IN THIS

18:10.055 --> 18:11.190
GAME.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.926
AND WE ALSO HAVE A MASTER PLAN
MOVING FORWARD THAT ALIGN WITH

18:13.992 --> 18:15.761
EACH OTHER.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.565
SO WHEN AZ A-- AZAH HAS HER
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT HANNAH,

18:19.631 --> 18:24.369
IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE BUT
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING.

18:24.436 --> 18:33.479
>> OKAY.

18:33.545 --> 18:37.015
>> BEFORE YOU FALL ASLEEP DO YOU
WANT TO HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.116
>> OKAY.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.052
>> ALYSSA AND CHRISTIAN ARE
JOINED AT THE HIP AND SHE

18:40.118 --> 18:41.253
CLEARLY HAS HIS EAR.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.256
THERE IS NO WAY HE WILL MAKE A
DECISION WITHOUT HER OPINION.

18:44.323 --> 18:48.760
SO IF I CAN SWAY ALYSSA SHE WILL
BE ABLE TO GET TO CHRISTIAN FOR

18:48.827 --> 18:54.800
ME AND HE CAN GET THE REST OF
THE TEAM.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.568
>> OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE H.O.H.

18:56.635 --> 19:00.506
WANTS IS WHAT YOUR TEAM WILL
RESPECT AND-- RESPECT AND

19:00.572 --> 19:01.773
FOLLOW.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.342
I WILL SAY TOR MY PERSONAL GAME
YOU GOING HOME ISN'T SOMETHING I

19:03.408 --> 19:03.775
WAS WANTING.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.043
I WILL SAY THAT.

19:05.110 --> 19:11.416
>> I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
SAFE IF SHE WERE H.O.H.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.584
>> OKAY.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.853
>> BECAUSE I DO THINK YOU COULD
POTENTIALLY BE ONE OF THE

19:14.920 --> 19:18.590
TARGETS BECAUSE IN HER MIND SHE
CAN MANIPULATE CHRISTIAN'S

19:18.657 --> 19:19.424
THOUGHTS A LITTLE.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.894
LIKE THEY WOULD TALK AT NIGHT, I
GUESS.

19:21.960 --> 19:31.937
AND SHE WOULD GIVE HIM GAME
TIPS.

19:32.004 --> 19:37.843
AND SHE WOULD GIVE HIM GAME
TIPS.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.412
>> SO SHE TOLD YOU SHE WAS
TRYING TO DO THAT.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.613
>> RIGHT.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.718
>> THAT WAS THE REASON WHY SHE
THOUGHT CHRISTIAN SHOULD STAY.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.287
>> SO SHE COULD SPEAK WITH HIM.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.023
>> I ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE WORRY
ABOUT HANNAH BECAUSE SHE IS

19:51.089 --> 19:52.691
SUPER SMART, SHE KNOWS THIS GAME
REALLY WELL.

19:52.758 --> 19:57.162
SO NOW THAT WHITNEY IS JUST KIND
OF CONFIRMING MY GUT INSTINCTS,

19:57.229 --> 20:00.399
I WANT TO LET CHRISTIAN KNOW
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WHITNEY IS

20:00.465 --> 20:08.006
THE TARGET, MAYBE HANNAH DOES
NEED TO GO HOME THIS WEEK.

20:08.073 --> 20:14.313
>> CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HANNAH
SAID?

20:14.379 --> 20:24.056
>> NO.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.659
>> SHE IS TALKING GAME AND TIPS.

20:27.726 --> 20:32.297
>> I AM THINKING HANNAH DOESN'T
RESPECT MY GAME.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.299
>> HEARING THIS FROM ALICE A
KIND OF MAKES ME THINK THAT

20:34.366 --> 20:38.236
HANNAH NEEDS TO GO HOME SOONER,
SHE DOESN'T RESPECT MY GAME AND

20:38.303 --> 20:41.740
WHY WOULD I WANT ANYONE LIKE
THAT IN THE HOUSE.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.776
HANNAH THINKS I'M PERSUADABLE.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.846
WELL, I WONDER WHAT SHE WOULD
THINK IF I WERE TO PERSUADE THE

20:47.913 --> 20:51.750
REST OF MY TEAM TO VOTE HER OUT
THIS WEEK.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.153
>> Julie: UP NEXT, IT'S THE
LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.489
HANNAH OR WHITNEY.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.458
WHO WILL BE HEADED OUT THE FRONT
DOOR.

20:59.524 --> 21:00.826
STAY WITH US.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.075
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER, HANNAH AND WHITNEY, TWO

21:17.142 --> 21:20.612
MEMBERS OF TEAM ACES BOTH ON THE
BLOCK.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.447
BUT ONLY ONE WILL SURVIVE THE
NIGHT.

21:22.514 --> 21:26.151
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM AN
TALK TO THE TWO NOMINEES.

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT I

STAY WITH US.

30:09.073 --> 30:11.509
>> WELCOME BACK TO BIG BROTHER,
I'M SITTING HERE WITH WHITNEY

30:11.576 --> 30:15.180
WHO WAS JUST EVICTED BY A VOTE
OF 10-0.

30:15.246 --> 30:18.082
WHITNEY, YOU SEE THE WRITING ON
THE WALL THIS WEEK.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.317
>> ABSOLUTELY.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.886
>> Julie: BUT WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR HOUSE MATES CHOSE TOW VICT

30:21.953 --> 30:24.155
YOU AND NOT HANNAH.

30:24.222 --> 30:30.762
>> A BIG PART OF IT IS I AM A
HUGE ADVOCATE FOR FEMALE

30:30.828 --> 30:34.098
EMPOWERMENT AND I HAVEN'T MADE
IT A SECRET, I SHOUT IT OUT, I

30:34.165 --> 30:37.068
LOVE WOMEN, I WANT WOMEN TO
BECOME A BETTER VERSION OF

30:37.135 --> 30:40.271
THEMSELVES, I'M VERY LOUD ABOUT
IT I KNOW THE TBIES WERE SCARED

30:40.338 --> 30:42.340
OF ME IN THAT WAY.

30:42.407 --> 30:45.510
AND I ALSO MADE IT VERY APPARENT
THAT I'M NOT AFRAID TO MAKE BIG

30:45.577 --> 30:46.744
MOVES.

30:46.811 --> 30:49.380
SO IF I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING
THAT HAS TO BE DONE, EVEN IF IT

30:49.447 --> 30:51.950
T IT MIGHT HURT OTHER PEOPLE,
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO THAT.

30:52.016 --> 30:55.019
HANNAH IS A LITTLE MORE QUIET
ABOUT HER THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.422
>> Julie: YOU THINK THEY SAW
YOU AS A BIGGER THREAT.

30:57.488 --> 31:00.959
>> I THINK YEAH, BECAUSE I'M NOT
AFRAID TO MAKE RISKIER MOVES,

31:01.025 --> 31:03.428
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WOULD BE ANY
BETTER AT COMPETITIONS THAN

31:03.494 --> 31:04.462
HANNAH, BUT YEAH.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.832
>> Julie: LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, AFTER THE VETO

31:07.899 --> 31:11.669
COMPETITION, YOU AND DEREK X HAD
A LITTLE BIT OF A RUN-IN WHEN HE

31:11.736 --> 31:13.771
IMPLIED THAT YOU WOULD BE THE
ONE GOING THIS WEEK.

31:13.838 --> 31:14.939
>> OH YEAH.

31:15.006 --> 31:18.376
>> Julie: YOU THEN WENT TO
DLISSIAN WHO WAS THE VETO HOLDER

31:18.443 --> 31:23.281
AND SAID HEY, SAVE ME, PUT DEREK
X UP.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.482
>> ABSOLUTELY.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.317
>> Julie: HE DIDN'T FIGHT, WHY
DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T GO FOR

31:26.384 --> 31:27.585
IT?

31:27.652 --> 31:29.487
>> THERE HAVE BEEN THREE MEN OUT
IN A ROW AND I KNOW THE MEN ARE

31:29.554 --> 31:31.990
REALLY SCARED OF WOMEN HAVING
THE CONTROL IN THE HOUSE.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.460
SO HE TOLD ME THAT WAS ONE OF
THE REASON HE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT

31:35.526 --> 31:38.696
DEREK UP IN STED OF ME, HE WAS
SCARED OF TOO MANY GIRLS.

31:38.763 --> 31:42.033
>> Julie: WHAT WOULD YOU SA
SAY IF I TOLD YOU DEREK X WHO

31:42.100 --> 31:47.972
WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR TEAM, THE
ACES, WAS PART OF AN ALLIANCE

31:48.039 --> 31:50.341
CALLED THE ROYAL FLUSH.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.476
>> OH, I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.

31:51.542 --> 31:52.877
>> Julie: WHY?

31:52.944 --> 31:57.048
WHO DO YOU THINK IS IN THIS, HOW
BIG DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

31:57.115 --> 31:58.149
>> I HONESTLY AM NOT SURE.

31:58.216 --> 32:02.787
I KNOW KYLAND AND DEREK X ARE
WORK ABSOLUTELY WORKING

32:02.854 --> 32:05.690
TOGETHER, I KNOW THAT X AND
ALYSSA AND CHRISTIAN HAVE TO BE

32:05.757 --> 32:06.858
WORKING TOGETHER.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.693
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO ELSE
WOULD BE INVOLVED BUT YOU CAN

32:08.760 --> 32:10.194
KIND OF SEE THEM WORKING AROUND.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.430
>> Julie: MAY I REVEAL THEM TO
YOU.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.097
>> YES, PLEASE.

32:13.164 --> 32:17.001
>> Julie: IT'S EIGHT MEMBERS.

32:17.068 --> 32:17.769
>> WHAT?

32:17.835 --> 32:20.171
>> Julie: DEREK F IS THE ONLY
ACE.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.372
>> THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.

32:21.439 --> 32:25.910
>> Julie: ALL FOUR KINGS ARE
IN T AND THREE REMAINING QUEENS,

32:25.977 --> 32:27.512
IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE WHY.

32:27.578 --> 32:30.948
>> MY TARGETS WERE DEREK X AND
KYLAND SO THAT MAKES SO MUCH

32:31.015 --> 32:34.652
SENSE WHY THEY WOULDN'T WANT ME
TO WIN H.O.H.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.821
>> Julie: ARE YOU MAD, ARE
YOU.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.524
>> I'M NOT BAD, IT'S BIG
BROTHER, IT'S A PART OF THE

32:39.590 --> 32:40.725
GAME.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.727
I WEERCHLT A PART, THAT SAY
BUMMER, I'M NOT MAD, EVERYTHING

32:42.794 --> 32:43.428
MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE NOW.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.762
>> Julie: ARE YOU IMPRESSED.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.431
>> I AM IMPRESSED.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.498
THEY KEPT THAT A SECRET.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.001
I WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG THEY
WERE IN AN ALLIANCE FOR.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.337
>> Julie: YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
OUT EVERYTHING.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.471
>> WOW.

32:53.538 --> 32:54.906
>> Julie: WHITNEY, IN THE
EVENT YOU ARE THE ONE EVICTED

32:54.972 --> 32:58.643

THEM.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.612
>> YES, PLEASE.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.748
>> WHITNEY, CHRISTIAN PUT YOU UP
ON THE BLOCK AND YOU WERE HIS

33:03.815 --> 33:05.016
MAIN TARGET.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.852
HAVE I A STRONG SENSE OF LOYALTY
TO MY TEAM W THAT IN MIND, I HAD

33:07.919 --> 33:09.287

YOU ARE AN AMAZING WOMAN AND I'M
SURE WE WILL BE FRIENDS LONG

FUTURE. AND I WISH YOU THE
ABSOLUTE BEST OF LUCK.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.476
>> WHITNEY, IT IS SAD TO SEE YOU
GO.

33:31.542 --> 33:36.180
I MUST BE HONEST, I DID HAVE
SOME NEGATIVE OPINIONS ABOUT YOU

33:36.247 --> 33:39.384
DUE TO YOUR COUPLE TIME WITH X
BECAUSE I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

33:39.450 --> 33:40.618
OF A CRUSH ON HIM.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.221
DO I HOPE THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A
GREAT FRIENDSHIP OUTSIDE THIS

33:43.287 --> 33:46.624
HOUSE AND I WISH YOU THE BEST OF
LUCK IN ALL OF YOUR ENDEAVORS.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.226

GAME ARE YOU NOT SOMEONE I

33:50.762 --> 33:51.729
WANTED TO GO HOME.

TOGETHER IN THIS GAME.

33:53.664 --> 33:56.601
