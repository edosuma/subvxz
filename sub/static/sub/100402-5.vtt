WEBVTT

02:00.537 --> 02:01.538
Where am I?

02:04.082 --> 02:04.916
Sabrina?

02:05.416 --> 02:08.628
Nick, do you have any idea
what you've done?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.590
You got high, freed the Dark Lord,
and then passed out.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.178
Nicholas, you had enough drugs
in your system to down a small army.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.848
Laudanum, morphine, opium,

02:19.931 --> 02:22.225
dragon's tears, and red mercury.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.685
Nick, you almost died.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.937
You need help. You need to get clean.

02:26.896 --> 02:31.568
Fortunately, there is an ancient,
albeit brutal, cleansing ritual

02:31.651 --> 02:33.528
I came across back in my Oxford days.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.072
The ritual normally requires
30 days to complete.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.282
Except we don't have 30 days

02:37.365 --> 02:40.201
because the pagans threatened
to exterminate the coven in three.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.788
This egg that I acquired in Loch Ness

02:43.872 --> 02:48.168
harbors properties that warp
and affect time.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.963
Thirty days of detoxing will, in reality,

02:52.046 --> 02:56.301
be compressed into one long,
unrelenting day.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.429
I hate you.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.058
I hate you, Sabrina!

03:06.060 --> 03:07.395
Do you hear me?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.355
I hate you.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.607
I hate you! I hate you!

03:17.363 --> 03:19.741
Are you sure this is the only way,
Ambrose?

03:21.993 --> 03:24.037
I'm afraid so, cousin.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.164
I just love him so much...

03:27.290 --> 03:28.666
and this isn't him.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.670
Ambrose, he's sick, and he needs me,

03:34.255 --> 03:36.382
-and the coven needs him.
-You're quite right.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.384
We're weak and under attack.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.386
We cannot afford to be down
another warlock,

03:40.470 --> 03:42.305
let alone one of our finest.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.767
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must, um... join Prudence.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.977
See what can be done
for Dorcas and Agatha.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.564
One sister turned to stone,
and the other one rendered insane.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.484
We'll check on Nicholas in a few hours.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.486
Which gives me enough time
to check on Roz,

03:56.569 --> 03:57.987
see how she and Harvey are doing.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.324
Please, please be careful.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.205
The Dark Lord is on the loose,
and the pagans are circling.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.707
These are dangerous times.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.959
Do you understand?

04:29.852 --> 04:30.937
Oh, no.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.897
Poor Roz.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.024
Please, Sabrina, tell me she's not dead.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.109
I don't think she's is.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.195
The same thing happened to Dorcas,
one of the Weird Sisters.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.990
Ambrose is doing his research thing
to figure out what he can do

04:42.073 --> 04:43.658
to reverse the transformation.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.287
I should never have left her side
at the carnival. They're freaks.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.290
They're pagans, the carnival people.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.249
Wait.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.835
-Does that mean they're witches?
-Not quite.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.004
They're like witches
but from a different time.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.338
Do they have powers?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.716
Some, yes, others, no.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.759
But they're all dangerous.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.138
So I really need you guys
to stay here and sit tight, okay?

05:05.221 --> 05:07.265
And then I'll be back,
and we can figure this out,

05:07.348 --> 05:09.058
and we'll get Roz cured.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.311
I promise, Harvey.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.659
Your Majesty?

05:27.368 --> 05:30.371
-You're needed in Hell.
- Lilith, now is not a good time.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.582
I have to get back to the Academy
and check on Nick.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.834
The business of Hell
doesn't stop for anyone.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.461
Not even for a queen.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.048
It's time for the second challenge
of the Unholy Regalia.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.925
The horde awaits you in the Grand Hall.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.678
You brought them all here?

05:47.555 --> 05:50.141
Now everyone knows that you, Sabrina,

05:51.684 --> 05:53.019
are Queen of Hell.

05:57.482 --> 06:01.444
By Infernal Law, we hereby declare

06:01.527 --> 06:06.240
that the next contest
of the Unholy Regalia shall commence.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.661
The Morningstar
and her challenger, Caliban,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.956
must seek and retrieve

06:14.040 --> 06:17.960
the second of our most unholy artifacts...

06:18.795 --> 06:21.756
Pontius Pilate's bowl.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.841
What do you say, princess?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.468
Ready for round two?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.096
Sorry, but I can't.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.847
- What?
-Not right now.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.561
Sabrina, by not accepting the challenge,

06:35.645 --> 06:38.022
you threaten the very existence
of your coven.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.899
Your friends and family.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.484
And do you know why?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.945
The balance of the cosmos has tipped.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.864
The arrival of the pagans.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.783
Your coven's loss of power.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.078
It's all a direct result

06:52.161 --> 06:55.706
of your refusal to claim,
absolutely, the throne.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.626
Don't you see, Sabrina?

06:59.669 --> 07:00.670
All of this...

07:02.547 --> 07:03.589
suffering,

07:06.801 --> 07:08.052
it's your fault.

07:16.727 --> 07:17.562
Well, that...

07:18.688 --> 07:19.856
that's not true.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.942
It is...

07:24.527 --> 07:28.948
but if you can recover
the Unholy Regalia, you...

07:30.199 --> 07:34.245
stand a chance of replenishing
your weakened coven's energies.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.329
But Nick?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.247
Sabrina,

07:37.665 --> 07:40.084
the coven is your alpha and omega
right now.

07:40.668 --> 07:45.631
So as loathe as I am to agree with Lilith,
you must do your duty and win.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.093
Not for yourself, but for all of us.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.846
Go and come back before the pagans arrive.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.145
Challenge accepted!

08:04.275 --> 08:06.277
<i>And where exactly is this bowl?</i>

08:06.694 --> 08:10.823
Pontius Pilate's bowl is located on a hill
just outside of Jerusalem.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.492
Golgotha?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.369
Otherwise known as the Place of Skulls.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.581
The place where the Nazarene himself
was crucified.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.833
And could you teleport me?

08:20.917 --> 08:25.087
I'm not sure my energies
are sufficient right now.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.130
Well...

08:26.839 --> 08:28.966
getting you to Golgotha is not a problem.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.803
Finding the bowl,
that's another matter entirely.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.058
You see, it's been locked
in an eternal time loop.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.435
Almost impossible to reach unless,
of course,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.729
you've mastered time magick,
which I sincerely doubt--

08:41.812 --> 08:43.648
Well, I have access to time magicks.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.945
I have water exposed to a mystical egg
that can warp time properties.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.488
Oh!

08:51.113 --> 08:52.740
Well, look at you.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.952
There's a painting at Dorian's.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.995
A portal to Golgotha.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.667
Gather your water,
and I'll... I'll meet you there.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.626
Okay.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.773
I won't be long.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.316
I promise.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.790
Aunt Hilda?

09:44.667 --> 09:45.626
Yes, love?

09:46.711 --> 09:47.712
Are you okay?

09:47.795 --> 09:50.464
I was gonna ask if you'd be able
to check on Nick while--

09:50.881 --> 09:52.758
There's a fly, Sabrina.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.885
Okay.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.598
A big fat juicy fly.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.600
Are you sure you're all right?

10:01.183 --> 10:02.351
Not really, no.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.773
You need something?

10:10.026 --> 10:10.901
No.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.112
Nothing.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.281
Never mind.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.731
Maybe we should do something
while we wait for Sabrina to get here.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.860
-Hey, guys.
-Robin, how did you--

10:52.943 --> 10:58.240
I went over to your place,
and your dad said you were over here.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.495
Hey, dude, what the hell is that?

11:02.578 --> 11:06.332
Could you wait outside
for, like, just a second?

11:06.415 --> 11:08.042
Uh, yeah.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.504
Yeah, totally. Cool.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.299
-What the hell is he doing here?

11:15.383 --> 11:18.094
Harvey, calm down, it's Robin. It's cool.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.512
It's not cool, Theo.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.597
Think about what's going on here.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.349
Robin can't know about any of it,

11:23.432 --> 11:25.184
or things will get so much worse.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.021
I know you like him,
but can you please get him out of here?

11:29.647 --> 11:30.648
Yeah.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.864
<i>Are you sure you're up for this?</i>

11:38.948 --> 11:40.866
Establishing a psychic connection
with Agatha

11:40.950 --> 11:44.412
-while she's in the middle of a mania?
<i>-</i>My will is stronger than hers.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.914
And how else will we know what happened?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.311
Her mind.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.563
It's like...

12:10.646 --> 12:12.148
It's like a raging storm.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.608
I... I cannot focus her thoughts.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.361
It's too difficult.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.946
Her brainwaves...

12:20.364 --> 12:21.615
like a tsunami.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.453
Don't try and re-order them.
Just slow them down if you can.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.466
What is it? What do you see?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.637
<i>-The great...</i>
-The great...

12:43.721 --> 12:45.014
<i>-...god...</i>
-...god...

12:45.848 --> 12:47.558
<i>-...Pan.</i>
-...Pan.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.938
Agatha was driven insane by his very gaze.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.442
The great god Pan.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.695
Moonlighting as that carnival barker,
Carcosa.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.616
In that case, things are rather more dire
than we've been imagining.

13:03.699 --> 13:07.328
The great god Pan is amongst
the oldest of the pagan monsters.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.872
He is madness personified.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.292
His very gaze engenders insanity
in witches and mortals alike.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.004
We... we have to inform Auntie Zee,

13:17.087 --> 13:20.591
and then we can ascertain
what secrets your sister Dorcas

13:20.674 --> 13:22.426
might be hiding in her stone form.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.773
Deliver us from the void
of this stricken realm unto Golgotha.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.610
The stony knoll of skull to take the helm.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.413
Is this...

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
The Place of Skulls?

13:54.834 --> 13:55.960
Yes.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.673
It's beautiful, isn't it?

14:04.802 --> 14:08.305
I'll be waiting right here for you,
Sabrina. And remember,

14:08.430 --> 14:11.183
make your way to the Temple of Jerusalem
as quick as you can.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.853
Retrieve Pontius Pilate's bowl
and get out of there.

14:13.936 --> 14:18.315
The slightest misstep could have you
trapped in the time loop forever.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.025
Understood.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.361
Douse away.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.084
Bestow your gaze
upon this land of prophecy.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.795
Back to the time of Anno Domini.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.174
Wait, how will I know it worked?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.606
That must be the temple.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.799
- Hyah! Whoo!

15:41.690 --> 15:42.775
Pontius Pilate.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.194
We've been awaiting you.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.572
Centurions, seize her!

15:57.706 --> 16:00.209
Why don't we just give the pagans Sabrina?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.169
What do you mean?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.463
This is all her fault.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.800
If it wasn't for Sabrina,
we'd still have our powers.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.094
We'd still have the Dark Lord
to protect us.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.597
The pagans don't want moon pies.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.724
The only thing they want is blood.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.434
Blood sacrifices.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.106
Oh, thy wanton and wayward witches.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.650
The Dark Lord.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.404
We thought you were--

16:28.487 --> 16:30.239
Escaped and gone?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.368
I would never abandon my flock.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.162
I'm always here to lead you...

16:38.664 --> 16:40.207
even when you've strayed.

16:40.916 --> 16:44.837
And unto where shall you lead us,
Dark Lord?

16:50.801 --> 16:54.096
To remain at the Academy
means certain death.

16:55.514 --> 16:59.893
But there is new life and old power
with the pagans.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.980
Join them, my children.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.205
You dared abandon me.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.087
-What are you doing? What is that?
-It is a tuning fork, Prudence.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.840
Capable of detecting
even the faintest of energies.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.095
Okay, what does it mean?

17:35.763 --> 17:37.556
It means there's hope.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.642
That deep within Dorcas,
there is life yet.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.146
Life yet, life within the stones.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.148
Life within the stone.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.902
No life within the stones--
Within the stones, in the stones.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.236
Ambrose, is my sister alive?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.823
She could be, and she has given me a tip.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.450
Now...

17:57.117 --> 17:59.995
our energies are depleted
to almost nothing, are they not?

18:00.079 --> 18:00.996
Yes.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.582
Then we must find a way
to amplify what we already have,

18:03.665 --> 18:06.043
and there may be a way in our backyard.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.419
Stonehenge.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
A circle of ancient stones

18:09.546 --> 18:12.007
that have been used to collect
and amplify energy for millennia.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
Wait, so are you suggesting
we go to England?

18:14.176 --> 18:16.345
No, we don't have to.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.934
There's a circle of stones in our woods
around the altar

18:22.017 --> 18:25.062
we used to perform our rituals
where my cousin was almost baptized.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.105
Why've we never seen it?

18:26.188 --> 18:29.024
Because the circle of stones
is underground.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.152
But if we use the last of our energies
to bring them up...

18:36.156 --> 18:38.992
Never has a High Priestess,
or a High Priest for that matter,

18:39.076 --> 18:40.744
faced such an impossible dilemma.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.956
If we surrender to the pagans,

18:44.623 --> 18:46.792
it spells certain doom for the coven.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.841
But with our powers waning
and the Academy's defenses all but eroded,

18:53.924 --> 18:57.845
we stand little chance of defending
ourselves against the pagans' might.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.433
What would our brother Edward do?

19:04.560 --> 19:05.519
Oh!

19:07.146 --> 19:08.188
He would, um...

19:14.736 --> 19:19.074
Well, don't just stand there, sister,
masticating, spit it out!

19:20.367 --> 19:23.328
What would Edward do in such a case?

19:23.829 --> 19:24.913
Um, uh...

19:24.997 --> 19:27.416
He would ask for help.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.502
-Oh.
-I mean, like, call on other witches.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.920
You know, Dezmelda.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.047
Reinforcements, anyway.

19:34.131 --> 19:39.011
Send out a distress signal, SOS,
you know, to other wayward witches.

19:39.094 --> 19:43.056
A summoning spell to assemble
the disenfranchised hedge witches.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.310
I doubt we have the power
to enact such a ritual.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.437
Actually, auntie, there might be a way.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.733
The stones buried beneath our clearing,
we could use them to amplify our energies,

19:53.609 --> 19:54.943
enhance a distress signal.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.737
To reinforce our numbers.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.324
Fortify our covens that we might
stand a chance against the pagans.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.617
It is a long shot.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.869
But it could be our very last hope,
Ambrose.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.079
But we need to be quick about it.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.339
<i>How could you possibly know</i>
<i>what a spider feels?</i>

20:16.757 --> 20:19.176
<i>O Metamorfóste, sto ónoma tis Aráchnis.</i>

20:39.071 --> 20:40.948
What took you so long, princess?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.617
Caliban?<i> </i>How did you get here so fast?

20:43.700 --> 20:46.328
The time stone.<i> </i>Did you not see it?

20:46.411 --> 20:48.330
I think so.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.581
Time stone.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.458
<i>That's what that was.</i>

20:51.541 --> 20:53.210
All you have to do is touch it.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.586
Good to know for my return trip,

20:54.670 --> 20:57.172
since they confiscated my canteen
of time water.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.759
There is no escaping this forsaken place

21:01.677 --> 21:03.679
or Pilate's perverse passion play.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.558
Every hundred years or so,
someone like you comes along,

21:08.642 --> 21:10.435
hoping to steal Pilate's bowl.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.606
A few even catch sight of it
as they breathe their last.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.360
But they all die here.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.863
Lucky bastards!

21:22.990 --> 21:25.701
I, Barabbas, never die.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.786
It's my curse.
I'm doomed, just like Pilate,

21:27.869 --> 21:34.084
to repeat this day of infamy
over and over and over again.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.172
Centurion, too...

21:41.633 --> 21:46.680
doomed, like us to perform
to a crowd long since vanished.

21:49.975 --> 21:54.521
Pilate could end it,
break the cycle, but he won't.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.148
Barabbas, what do you mean,

21:56.231 --> 21:59.651
"catch sight of the bowl
as they breathe their last"?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.570
How? When?

22:02.529 --> 22:05.407
After Pontius Pilate pardons me,
as he always does,

22:05.490 --> 22:08.952
and condemns you both to die,
as he always does...

22:09.703 --> 22:11.455
he'll wash his hands in the bowl.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.957
Wash his hands of your fate,

22:15.167 --> 22:16.376
and you'll be crucified.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.090
He scrubs his hands bloody,
but the stains,

22:23.133 --> 22:24.468
they never go away.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.179
That's it, then.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.182
When he's washing his hands,
that's my chance to get the bowl.

22:30.265 --> 22:33.685
-Not if I get there first.
-You suck, Caliban!

22:35.020 --> 22:38.565
You aspire to be king,
but you cheated last time.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.151
Even a king of Hell
must have some dignity.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.237
Some honor.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.091
Oh, hey, Carl, look. It's the new kid.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.133
Hey, new kid.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.593
Oh!

23:07.010 --> 23:08.762
Give me back my cap, dude.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.472
Oh!

23:11.014 --> 23:13.058
For real, I'm warning you.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.518
Oh, shit, Carl.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.728
New kid's talking like
he's actually gonna do something.

23:18.730 --> 23:22.651
All thieves shall pay in blood
in wormy beds of putrid mud.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.113
What the hell, Billy?

23:26.738 --> 23:29.324
Hey, Theo. Is the new kid with you?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.242
Yeah.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.577
So give him his cap and back off!

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
Sorry, new kid. We didn't know.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.251
Bye, guys.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.087
-Anyways...
-Yeah.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.173
Wow.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.135
Tough guy, huh?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.514
<i>So, uh...</i>

23:54.015 --> 23:55.559
those guys are cool with you?

23:55.642 --> 23:56.685
Yeah, they're...

23:57.936 --> 23:59.104
they're getting better.

24:00.272 --> 24:05.318
They were definitely a lot less cool
when I started transitioning.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.946
But your dad's cool with it, right?

24:08.613 --> 24:10.115
He was hesitant...

24:10.949 --> 24:11.950
at first.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.745
My friends were amazing
from the very beginning.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.330
Yeah.

24:18.748 --> 24:19.749
Yeah, they, uh...

24:21.293 --> 24:22.502
they seem really great.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.923
What about your family?

24:27.757 --> 24:28.592
Um...

24:29.509 --> 24:30.552
They, uh...

24:32.554 --> 24:34.347
they are who they are.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.558
Are you gonna drink that?

24:48.278 --> 24:49.112
Prisoners!

24:52.240 --> 24:57.245
The punishment for trespassing in Golgotha
is 100 lashes.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.749
You may choose who receives them.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.584
I'll take the lashes.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.127
What?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.922
-Why?
-You're the Queen of Hell.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.174
I will not have you debased in such a way.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.635
You see, I do have honor.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.887
Also, I'm made of clay, remember?

25:14.304 --> 25:15.847
What? So the lashes won't hurt you?

25:16.890 --> 25:19.434
No, they'll hurt,
they just won't draw blood.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.604
-Besides, you're too cute for scars.

25:28.443 --> 25:32.197
Your lover's sacrifice is noble
but pointless.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.366
He's not my lover.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.534
It's always the same.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.161
First, the imprisonment,
then the lashings.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.455
I am pardoned whilst you are condemned.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.168
Would that it could be
the other way around.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.629
Barabbas...

25:49.005 --> 25:50.799
what happens when you're pardoned?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.388
Tell me exactly.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.353
We humble ourselves before you.

26:04.938 --> 26:09.401
We forsake our former coven to join you,
oh, powerful pagans.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.366
Welcome, children.

26:19.995 --> 26:24.791
As his time approaches,
the Green Man, the oldest of the gods,

26:26.293 --> 26:28.545
will need ever more nourishment.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.924
And what better sustenance

26:33.008 --> 26:34.968
-than witches' blood!

26:44.519 --> 26:45.812
Elspeth!

26:51.860 --> 26:53.695
Should I hunt him down and kill him?

26:53.778 --> 26:54.696
No!

26:54.779 --> 26:57.866
Let him go and tell his coven
what happened here today.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.582
Traitorous children.

27:06.666 --> 27:10.629
All the Sons and Daughters of Night
deserve death for how they treated me,

27:11.963 --> 27:13.214
abandoned me.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.388
And the mortals too.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.821
Citizens of Judea.

27:38.490 --> 27:42.702
It is in my power
to pardon one of these three criminals.

27:44.996 --> 27:45.914
Who will it be?

27:46.706 --> 27:48.708
Barabbas!

27:49.542 --> 27:51.044
The thief, Barabbas?

27:52.128 --> 27:53.713
Or one of the foreigners?

28:01.388 --> 28:05.100
Barabbas!

28:05.183 --> 28:06.267
So be it.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.978
Barabbas is pardoned!

28:18.321 --> 28:20.073
As for the foreigners,

28:22.534 --> 28:24.119
let them be executed!

28:25.704 --> 28:28.790
As I wash my hands of their blood.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.173
Barabbas, stop! Barabbas!

28:39.384 --> 28:42.053
It is time, prefect of Judea.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.640
Let this cycle be broken.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.016
Trickery!

28:52.772 --> 28:55.024
Stop her! Kill her!

28:55.108 --> 28:56.609
She must not escape!

29:15.712 --> 29:17.422
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

29:22.719 --> 29:25.138
Sabrina!<i> </i>Excellent work.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.973
No trouble, I take it.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.267
Tons of trouble.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.979
Caliban was there.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.606
I left him behind.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.608
Oh, well, it can't be helped,

29:37.025 --> 29:39.527
but hopefully,
he'll be stuck in the time loop forever.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.154
I... I don't want that.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.822
It's the past.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.283
Whatever has happened
has already happened.

29:45.742 --> 29:49.329
Dust to dust, clay to clay.
Now step lively.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.873
It's time for you to claim your victory.

29:51.956 --> 29:52.874
No.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.419
Nick and the coven first.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.130
Then Hell.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.062
Dorcas, with her energies,
should complete the circle.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.774
Will this really work, Ambrose?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.192
It had better.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.365
We're ready for the summoning, Auntie Zee.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.367
Then I shall gather the coven.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.196
Hilda?

31:06.239 --> 31:07.991
Why are you hiding in here?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.910
And what's the matter with your cheek?

31:11.077 --> 31:13.621
-It's, uh... it's a toothache.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.790
You and your sweet tooth.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.878
Never mind about that now.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.880
It's time to gather for the summoning.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.609
Look at you.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.700
Look at you.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.499
Look at you. Look at me.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.293
Look at me.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.461
Look at me.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.674
-Who's there?
- Doing nothing!

32:07.175 --> 32:08.009
Pathetic!

32:11.471 --> 32:13.348
Why don't you do something?

32:16.643 --> 32:19.187
Like... like what?

32:19.270 --> 32:22.815
Like go to the carnival
and show those heathens what's what.

32:24.192 --> 32:29.155
A few boys with baseball bats
can send a potent message. Hmm?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.617
And if nothing else,

32:33.618 --> 32:35.453
you won't feel quite so...

32:36.621 --> 32:37.830
pathetic.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.127
You know,

32:45.254 --> 32:46.547
that's a good idea.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.904
You okay?

33:10.863 --> 33:12.907
I mean, we can slow down if you want to.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.119
I'm okay. I'm... great, actually.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.036
I just...

33:19.664 --> 33:20.498
I...

33:21.833 --> 33:23.751
I don't know anything about you,

33:24.627 --> 33:26.087
and I want to.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.714
Where did you grow up?

33:29.340 --> 33:30.341
Uh...

33:32.510 --> 33:33.469
We...

33:34.053 --> 33:35.263
My family...

33:37.098 --> 33:38.850
we moved around a lot,

33:40.476 --> 33:42.520
and any time I'd make friends
in a new town,

33:42.603 --> 33:44.856
we'd just have to leave again.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.275
What do your parents do?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.027
Military.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.031
But I'm not like them.

33:55.241 --> 33:56.743
-Okay.
-I mean...

34:01.330 --> 34:02.498
I was adopted,

34:05.668 --> 34:07.920
and I don't believe
all the things they do.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.090
The older I get,

34:11.632 --> 34:14.677
the less their beliefs make sense to me.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.683
Wait, you've never had to move?

34:21.601 --> 34:23.186
No.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.732
My family's been in Greendale
for, like, generations.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.484
It's like we're planted here.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.156
I've never had roots like that.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.953
You know, sometimes I wonder...

34:43.956 --> 34:45.875
what would it be like if I just...

34:47.794 --> 34:49.420
stayed behind for once?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.344
I mean, would it be the end of the world?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.309
<i>Theo. Theo!</i>

35:03.392 --> 35:04.435
Hey, Harvey.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.730
You're gonna do what?

35:08.397 --> 35:10.775
Harvey, slow down.<i> </i>Sabrina said--

35:12.610 --> 35:13.945
Can't it wait until--

35:14.570 --> 35:16.155
Harvey?<i> </i>Harvey!

35:20.326 --> 35:22.036
Is everything okay?

35:22.787 --> 35:25.832
Harvey and some meathead dudes
are gonna trash the carnival.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.251
No.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.255
We have to stop them.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.466
Yeah.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.141
Ambrose, what the heaven is going on?

35:43.224 --> 35:45.977
I did a spot of redecorating, cousin.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.355
So we may summon
hedge witches near and far

35:49.438 --> 35:51.399
to assist us against the pagans.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.860
You are just in time.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.111
I have to check on Nick.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.696
I already did, he's fine.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.365
I've applied leeches
to suck out the toxicity from his body.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.492
Okay.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.829
For the moment, we need your presence
and your energies here.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.623
Of course.<i> </i>Count me in.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.787
How terribly they've treated you, Agatha.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.624
One of their own.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.259
It's right and just...

37:01.469 --> 37:03.262
that you seek your revenge.

37:11.562 --> 37:12.563
Coven...

37:13.606 --> 37:15.191
our powers are depleted,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.110
and our pagan enemies are closing in.

37:18.194 --> 37:21.572
So today, we shall use
the very last of our natural magicks

37:21.656 --> 37:24.116
to call upon the wayward witches
to join us

37:24.867 --> 37:27.370
as we stand
within a circle of ancient stones.

37:27.453 --> 37:31.749
Together they have the power
to amplify energy

37:31.832 --> 37:33.751
to broadcast our message.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.671
But it is up to us
and our psychic intention

37:36.754 --> 37:38.256
to set them in harmony.

37:45.888 --> 37:49.267
Stones of old, hear our incantation,

37:49.350 --> 37:51.727
deliver thus our invitation.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.193
We call forth
the covenless witches of the forests,

38:00.194 --> 38:03.030
the banished, the exiled,

38:03.114 --> 38:05.783
the disenfranchised witches
who dwell in caves.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.078
All are called upon.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.288
All are summoned.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.581
Hear us and answer our call.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.877
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:19.672
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:19.755 --> 38:21.507
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:21.590 --> 38:23.801
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:23.884 --> 38:26.095
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:26.178 --> 38:27.972
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:28.055 --> 38:29.181
Ambrose, it's working.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.349
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:30.433 --> 38:31.475
The stones are harmonizing.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.102
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:33.185 --> 38:35.229
<i>Lungere nobis covina.</i>

38:35.313 --> 38:36.439
<i>Lungere nobis--</i>

38:52.997 --> 38:54.498
No!

38:54.582 --> 38:56.834
Agatha. Agatha, stop!

38:56.917 --> 38:58.085
Stop this!

38:59.253 --> 39:00.838
How did you free yourself?

39:00.921 --> 39:03.174
He did. The Dark Lord did.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.717
The Dark Lord is here?

39:05.968 --> 39:08.763
He was. Now he's gone.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.806
Ambrose, did it work?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.141
Did the message get out?

39:12.224 --> 39:16.354
The transmission was cut short.
The frequencies never fully harmonized.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.396
She hath perished.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.065
Oh, Melvin, what now?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.151
The pagans did slay Elspeth.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.989
They were never gonna absorb us
into their ranks.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.200
They plan to kill us all for our blood.

39:31.243 --> 39:32.453
It's just as I feared.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.997
Surrender was never an option.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.170
What the hell was that?

40:28.217 --> 40:29.760
Come out and face us!

40:30.302 --> 40:31.637
What the hell's going on?

40:47.945 --> 40:51.615
Why, you're not even men.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.285
You're boys.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.579
We're not leaving until you tell me

40:56.662 --> 40:58.914
what you and your friends did
to my girlfriend.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.459
But of course.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.794
Take me to her.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.255
I will go freely.

41:09.341 --> 41:10.468
Let's get her, boys.

41:16.056 --> 41:16.891
Wait.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.310
Let's go.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.313
Something's not right.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.129
First, my summoning is a bust.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.674
And now Nick seems worse.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.384
Didn't the leeches work?

41:53.260 --> 41:54.553
Come and have a look.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.348
What?

41:57.431 --> 41:59.183
The leeches are all dead.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.936
Killed by whatever they absorbed
from Nicolas, and...

42:02.728 --> 42:04.104
if I cut one open...

42:06.524 --> 42:07.483
Ugh.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.908
What the heaven is that?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.085
Harvey, what happened?

42:26.627 --> 42:28.087
They turned to pigs.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.506
-The guys.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.091
What?

42:32.174 --> 42:33.175
How?

42:34.009 --> 42:35.052
She did it.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.554
Some woman.

42:36.637 --> 42:39.056
We need to get them someplace safe.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.311
My dad has a barn.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.277
It is <i>radicum outum diaboli,</i>
Satan's residue.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.655
Wait, what do you mean?

42:55.322 --> 42:58.284
A little gift your father left behind
in poor Nicolas.

42:59.159 --> 43:01.370
Part of him. Like tar in a smoker's lungs,

43:01.453 --> 43:05.207
except this tar is alive,
infernal, and corrupting.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.835
Nick said he could still feel
the Dark Lord inside him.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.087
I didn't think he was talking literally.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.882
We need to get what's left of Lucifer
out of dear Nicholas.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.801
Not another exorcism, Ambrose.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.761
The last one nearly killed me.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.346
Well, there might be another way.

43:19.430 --> 43:24.435
What if instead of forcing the residue
out of Nicholas, we...

43:25.519 --> 43:29.398
lure it out.
Enticed it with a stronger host.

43:29.898 --> 43:31.775
A host with blood identical to it.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.113
You mean me.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.037
This holy water
will neutralize the residue.

43:46.165 --> 43:49.209
If this works, if your blood coaxes

43:49.293 --> 43:51.128
the Dark Lord's essence
out of Nicholas's body,

43:51.211 --> 43:53.088
you'll need
to keep your fists closed tightly..

43:54.256 --> 43:57.134
...lest the residue
enter your bloodstream.

43:58.677 --> 43:59.803
Ready.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.569
Step two! Quickly!

45:13.168 --> 45:14.211
Did it work?

45:15.796 --> 45:17.715
We'll know once Nicholas wakes up.

45:19.341 --> 45:21.677
Now I know you must take
Pilate's bowl to Hell,

45:21.760 --> 45:24.972
but I might have a use
for the Dark Lord's residue.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.474
One more trick up my sleeve.

45:28.767 --> 45:30.227
<i>We've nearly run out of time.</i>

45:30.811 --> 45:35.649
The pagans' intention is to kill us
as our ancestors did to theirs,

45:35.733 --> 45:36.984
after the Unholy Wars.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.026
Zelda?

45:39.236 --> 45:43.615
Zelda, I think... I think that the pagans
might have done something to me.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.743
Not just you, Hilda!<i> </i>All of us!

45:46.368 --> 45:49.246
But if we stay here,
we'll be lambs to the slaughter.

45:50.247 --> 45:53.000
I feel like I'm changing.

45:53.083 --> 45:56.128
We could flee perhaps,
to the Mountains of Madness,

45:56.211 --> 45:59.006
but to run and hide like cowards...

45:59.631 --> 46:01.759
-We are Spellmans, after all.
<i>-</i>Zelda!

46:02.301 --> 46:04.470
-I'm scared.
-We're all scared, Hilda.

46:04.928 --> 46:06.138
Even I'm scared.

46:07.181 --> 46:12.436
Aunties, I have an unorthodox idea
that just might buy us some time.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.981
This jar contains traces
of the Dark Lord's essence

46:16.064 --> 46:17.816
that we removed from Nicholas's body.

46:18.734 --> 46:22.488
Perhaps Lucifer isn't quite finished
protecting us yet.

46:33.749 --> 46:34.625
Nick?

46:36.460 --> 46:37.336
Hey.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.964
How are you feeling?

46:42.090 --> 46:43.091
Good.

46:44.718 --> 46:45.677
Better.

46:51.016 --> 46:52.226
Ashamed.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.478
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.730
Nick, you were sick.

46:57.981 --> 47:00.943
You had some part of the Dark Lord
still in you,

47:02.361 --> 47:03.487
but it's all over now.

47:04.988 --> 47:07.032
The ritual worked. You're good.

47:07.825 --> 47:11.578
And we can go back to how things were.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.130
That's the thing, Sabrina.
I don't think I can.

47:27.553 --> 47:28.887
I don't think we can.

47:31.265 --> 47:32.266
Why not?

47:33.725 --> 47:36.103
Because right now, I don't really know
if it was the Dark Lord

47:36.186 --> 47:37.479
that made me act the way I did...

47:38.564 --> 47:41.692
say those... cruel things to you.

47:44.236 --> 47:46.405
Or if he activated...

47:48.574 --> 47:50.701
exploited something
that was already there.

47:50.784 --> 47:52.661
Some... need,

47:52.744 --> 47:54.121
some weakness.

47:54.204 --> 47:57.374
Nick, what he did was awful
and traumatic, but...

47:57.457 --> 47:59.585
No, you're not listening to me, Sabrina.

48:00.002 --> 48:03.422
What if the Dark Lord was able
to drag me down so low

48:03.505 --> 48:04.423
because...

48:06.884 --> 48:08.760
because there's something wrong with me?

48:08.844 --> 48:12.055
There is nothing wrong with you.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.558
Nick, you have to believe me.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.935
Look, whatever the truth is, Sabrina, I...

48:21.273 --> 48:23.317
I need time to work it out for myself.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.695
I need space,

48:27.613 --> 48:28.614
a break,

48:32.075 --> 48:33.577
and I think you do too.

48:35.662 --> 48:37.664
What are you saying, Nick?

48:39.708 --> 48:42.044
I'm saying you're the Queen of Hell!

48:44.087 --> 48:47.299
You have a coven to save
and a realm to fight for,

48:47.382 --> 48:49.968
and I'm... I'm just a distraction.

48:50.052 --> 48:51.303
Then I'll give it all up.

48:53.013 --> 48:55.557
I'll give it all up for you, Nick.

48:55.641 --> 48:58.560
The only reason I said I was Queen
was to get you back.

48:59.311 --> 49:00.395
That may be...

49:02.230 --> 49:03.732
but you won't give it up.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.401
There's too much at risk.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.946
Also, you don't want to.

49:10.155 --> 49:12.491
You're chasing something right now.

49:13.492 --> 49:16.244
Power... being Queen...

49:16.954 --> 49:19.915
and I... I'll only slow you down.

49:19.998 --> 49:20.958
Don't...

49:22.334 --> 49:26.004
say you're doing this for me,
to protect me.

49:27.589 --> 49:28.840
Please don't.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.971
I love you, but I can't do this anymore.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.143
I'm so sorry.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.898
Nick. Nick.

49:46.692 --> 49:47.693
Kiss me.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.195
Please.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.908
If I kiss you at this moment,

49:58.161 --> 50:00.122
I'll never be able to walk away.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.430
I love you, Nick.

50:21.226 --> 50:22.978
Didn't anyone tell you?

50:28.066 --> 50:30.986
Queens aren't allowed to cry.

50:33.572 --> 50:34.781
Now come on.

50:36.366 --> 50:38.952
You and Pilate's bowl are needed in Hell.

50:46.626 --> 50:49.296
I am never eating bacon again.

50:58.430 --> 51:02.476
Robin, there's a few things
you need to know about Greendale.

51:03.518 --> 51:05.228
Theo, wait.

51:06.813 --> 51:08.065
Let me go first.

51:10.067 --> 51:13.570
There's some things I need to tell you...

51:17.407 --> 51:18.450
both of you.

51:29.044 --> 51:31.088
Oh, sorry, we're closed for the night.

51:44.476 --> 51:45.727
Doctor Cee?

51:45.811 --> 51:46.895
Hilda?

51:47.938 --> 51:48.897
Hilda!

51:49.397 --> 51:51.942
My love, what are you doing here?

51:52.943 --> 51:55.862
I just, uh... Well, I missed you.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.158
Can I get a cuddle?

52:12.170 --> 52:14.881
Let it be known to the hordes of Hell

52:14.965 --> 52:19.219
that Sabrina Morningstar
was victorious in Golgotha.

52:19.302 --> 52:20.303
She has returned

52:20.387 --> 52:23.807
with one of the most pernicious
of arcane artifacts.

52:23.890 --> 52:26.351
I give you the bowl of Pontius Pilate.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.568
And where is Prince Caliban?

52:38.071 --> 52:43.368
Sabrina's victory over Caliban
is absolute.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.875
I'm not sure he survived.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.920
You don't really wish that were true,
do you, princess?

52:55.380 --> 52:56.548
Caliban?

52:56.631 --> 52:58.675
-But how?
-I'm made of clay.

52:59.926 --> 53:00.927
I waited.

53:01.595 --> 53:07.142
Under the dust of the ages for 2,000 years
after you cheated,

53:07.225 --> 53:09.144
stole Pilate's bowl, and...

53:09.895 --> 53:11.730
left me for dead.

53:13.356 --> 53:16.610
Is that the dignity
that you spoke of? Hmm?

53:17.110 --> 53:18.111
The honor?

53:19.821 --> 53:23.617
I won't lose our next and final contest.

53:23.992 --> 53:25.911
Hell will be mine.

53:26.453 --> 53:29.664
You've each won a challenge,
which can only mean one thing.

53:30.415 --> 53:31.499
Sudden death.

53:33.210 --> 53:36.004
The winner of the next trial

53:36.087 --> 53:40.425
shall reign in Hell for all eternity.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.804
Go on. Yeah!

53:44.888 --> 53:49.267
And I shall reign by your side, Sabrina,
forever and a glorious day.

53:50.727 --> 53:53.521
It's hell-sent
your father's still indisposed.

53:54.356 --> 54:00.070
He would lose his horned head
at the sight of this most Unholy Regalia.

54:00.153 --> 54:03.073
Actually,
Lucifer escaped from the Academy.

54:04.950 --> 54:06.326
Nobody knows where he is.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.119
What?

54:09.621 --> 54:14.042
The Dark Lord is free,
and you... you didn't say anything to me?

54:14.125 --> 54:17.545
Well, I had other things on my mind.

54:17.629 --> 54:21.925
Sabrina, your father will kill me
for betraying him.

54:23.301 --> 54:24.970
It's only a matter of time.

54:30.642 --> 54:33.520
I simply mixed the Dark Lord's residue
with a bit of salt,

54:33.603 --> 54:36.022
thieves vinegar and Hoyt's Cologne
to create an--

54:36.106 --> 54:37.399
A warding resin.

54:37.983 --> 54:38.858
Precisely.

54:38.942 --> 54:42.445
Painted over every door jamb and crevice,
this concoction may provide

54:42.529 --> 54:44.281
enough protection
to keep the pagans at bay,

54:44.364 --> 54:46.366
at least for a short while.

54:50.370 --> 54:51.830
Need an extra pair of hands?

54:59.796 --> 55:01.548
Why did you bring us here?

55:04.718 --> 55:05.635
Gryla.

55:06.052 --> 55:07.554
I heard your call.

55:13.059 --> 55:14.102
Pesta!

55:14.728 --> 55:15.895
Sycorax!

55:18.273 --> 55:19.566
Mambo Marie.

55:19.649 --> 55:23.069
You summoned us here against our will.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.362
Wait. No.

55:24.446 --> 55:28.742
For that, all in this house will die.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.437
