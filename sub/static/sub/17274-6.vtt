00:01.601 --> 00:03.535
- Where's Borz?
- Scumbag's in the next room.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.237
- You got your hour with him?
- I did.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.405
Where you off to?

00:06.407 --> 00:07.573
You know I'm not
at liberty to say.

00:07.624 --> 00:10.576
Is there anything
you don't do well?

00:10.578 --> 00:13.412
Go, go, go.
Let's go!

00:13.463 --> 00:16.665
Last night was not pretend.
I know you felt something too.

00:16.716 --> 00:20.002
Sydney, listen to me.
That's not even my real name.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.504
[Grunts]
What? What is going on?

00:22.555 --> 00:24.256
You know
my key's been stolen.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.808
Whose account paid
for Chicago?

00:25.842 --> 00:28.394
Ivan Kravec.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.428
You need to catch up.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.933
Why the change of heart?

00:33.935 --> 00:36.068
Maybe I wanted
a happy ending.

00:36.102 --> 00:38.938
- Incoming call--Hayley.
- Work again?

00:38.940 --> 00:42.408
I always choose you
over the mission.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.692
But you?

00:43.743 --> 00:45.527
Well, you choose the mission.

00:48.148 --> 00:51.150
Apology accepted.
That was fast.

00:51.184 --> 00:52.685
I thought you were gonna
put up a fight.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.003
Oh, I would've.

00:54.037 --> 00:57.122
But I already know what you did
to make it up to me.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.757
Natasha told you?

00:58.792 --> 01:01.460
When?

01:01.462 --> 01:04.846
When she showed up
at my place.

01:04.881 --> 01:08.851
Natasha's at your apartment?

01:08.885 --> 01:10.636
Okay.
She's wanted by the FBI.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.305
Your apology was sounding
a lot better a few seconds ago.

01:13.356 --> 01:15.024
She's a fugitive.

01:15.058 --> 01:17.276
What are you gonna do
if she gets discovered?

01:17.310 --> 01:19.478
She won't.
I'll make sure of it.

01:19.529 --> 01:23.007
- How?
- I'll figure it out.

01:23.031 --> 01:24.193
What about Hayley?

01:25.416 --> 01:26.749
I'll figure that out too.

01:29.229 --> 01:31.726
You don't miss having this kind
of drama in your life, do ya?

01:33.983 --> 01:36.618
My life is dramatic enough.

01:36.652 --> 01:39.787
[Cell phone chimes]

01:42.658 --> 01:44.876
Sounds like it's about
to get even more dramatic.

01:44.910 --> 01:46.211
Check, please.

01:46.245 --> 01:48.329
I'm not sure
about Rue De Lyon.

01:48.380 --> 01:50.465
Go look it up.

01:50.499 --> 01:51.799
Joan?

01:51.834 --> 01:54.168
We just received
some time-sensitive intel

01:54.170 --> 01:56.137
about Ivan Kravec.

01:56.171 --> 01:58.673
N.S.A. provided us with data
from their MYSTIC program,

01:58.675 --> 02:01.809
analyzing every cell phone call
made out of Paris last week.

02:01.844 --> 02:05.563
Looks like Kravec is gearing up
for some sort of big meeting,

02:05.598 --> 02:07.899
possibly as early as tonight.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.984
Then I should go back in.
I got close with Kravec.

02:10.019 --> 02:11.519
He likes me.
He liked you.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.021
That was before you drugged him
and vanished.

02:13.072 --> 02:15.073
We don't know
how he feels about you now.

02:15.107 --> 02:16.357
I covered my tracks with him.

02:16.359 --> 02:18.109
Let me get back in
and see if he still trusts me,

02:18.160 --> 02:20.612
and we can go from there.

02:20.663 --> 02:22.914
Annie's right.

02:22.948 --> 02:24.749
Right now Kravec is
at the top of the food chain.

02:24.783 --> 02:26.251
We need to figure out
if he's the one

02:26.285 --> 02:28.536
behind the Chicago attack
or he was just taking orders.

02:28.587 --> 02:30.622
- So is that a yes?
- Yes.

02:30.673 --> 02:32.206
You're on the next flight
to Paris.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.208
Auggie, you can handle Annie
from here.

02:34.210 --> 02:36.294
I'll loop Calder in.

02:41.133 --> 02:42.383
I'm so sorry.
[Mack crying]

02:42.385 --> 02:44.552
Traffic was horrific.

02:44.554 --> 02:46.220
Oh, don't worry about it,
but I do have to go.

02:46.272 --> 02:48.640
We're--we're wining and dining
some members

02:48.691 --> 02:50.308
of the house appropriations
committee.

02:50.359 --> 02:52.727
McQuaid doesn't have enough of
the intelligence budget already?

02:52.729 --> 02:54.612
Just doing my job.

02:54.647 --> 02:57.565
[Groans playfully]
Ooh.

02:57.616 --> 02:59.534
What's wrong
with your shoulder?

02:59.568 --> 03:01.235
I must have tweaked it.

03:01.237 --> 03:04.906
- Doing what?
- I don't even know.

03:04.957 --> 03:08.576
I got to go.
Okay, see you.

03:08.578 --> 03:11.496
See you, smiley.

03:13.582 --> 03:14.916
I brought wine.

03:14.967 --> 03:18.136
- Ah! [Laughs]
- Hey.

03:18.170 --> 03:20.451
You're never gonna get tired
of doing that to me, are you?

03:20.472 --> 03:22.807
I like how you look
when you're surprised.

03:22.841 --> 03:23.925
Yeah.

03:29.598 --> 03:32.734
Mm, I'm gonna need a new
laptop with a faster processor,

03:32.768 --> 03:35.520
by the way.
Wait. What? Why?

03:35.571 --> 03:37.772
I'm trying to crack the local
traffic-camera server.

03:37.774 --> 03:39.107
- No, no, no.
- I need something

03:39.109 --> 03:40.658
that can handle
a bigger data load.

03:40.693 --> 03:42.110
Tash, if you do
stuff like that,

03:42.112 --> 03:44.612
you're gonna alert people
that you're here.

03:44.663 --> 03:46.781
Auggie, I wouldn't have
lasted long on the run

03:46.832 --> 03:49.784
if I got caught doing
something as basic as that.

03:49.835 --> 03:52.286
Besides, how will I know
if the FBI's coming for me

03:52.288 --> 03:53.955
if I don't hack
the traffic cameras?

03:53.957 --> 03:55.790
The FBI won't come for you

03:55.792 --> 03:57.625
if you don't attract
their attention.

03:57.676 --> 04:00.762
I'm not a housecat, Auggie.
I need to get out.

04:00.796 --> 04:03.431
How did you make it four years
on the run acting like that?

04:03.465 --> 04:04.966
You need to play it safe.

04:05.017 --> 04:06.434
I didn't come to the U.S.
to be with you

04:06.468 --> 04:08.803
because I like
playing it safe.

04:08.854 --> 04:11.889
[Drawer slams]

04:11.940 --> 04:14.392
I know this is hard,

04:14.443 --> 04:17.644
but we'll make it work.

04:17.696 --> 04:19.480
You brought wine.

04:19.482 --> 04:21.232
Yeah.

04:21.283 --> 04:23.234
And now you have that look
you always get.

04:23.285 --> 04:24.902
What are you not telling me?

04:30.376 --> 04:32.994
Before you showed up here...

04:33.045 --> 04:34.829
I was seeing someone,

04:34.831 --> 04:37.582
and I haven't broken it off yet
because...

04:37.633 --> 04:40.084
Well...

04:40.135 --> 04:43.054
Because I didn't know
how real any of this was.

04:43.088 --> 04:45.807
I never thought I'd see
you again after Paris.

04:45.841 --> 04:49.510
Who is it?

04:49.561 --> 04:51.512
That Hayley girl
that keeps calling?

04:51.563 --> 04:53.765
Yeah.

04:57.519 --> 04:59.520
We haven't seen each other
in years.

04:59.522 --> 05:01.272
I didn't expect you
to be celibate.

05:01.323 --> 05:03.775
[Chuckles]

05:06.779 --> 05:08.696
I'm gonna break it off
with her.

05:08.747 --> 05:10.998
I'm just waiting
for the right moment to do it.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.583
Good.

05:12.618 --> 05:15.036
And when you do,
tell that bitch

05:15.087 --> 05:18.256
to stay the hell away
from my man.

05:32.688 --> 05:36.524
After you vanished, I didn't
expect to hear from you again.

05:36.558 --> 05:38.726
Well, I don't like
to wear out my welcome.

05:38.777 --> 05:41.729
You are an unusual woman.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.898
No, I'm just not the kind
of woman you're used to.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.235
Besides, I had an early plane,
and I left a note.

05:47.286 --> 05:49.904
What can I do for you,
miss Miller?

05:49.955 --> 05:52.406
You can start
by not calling me Miss Miller.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.825
Ah, but in Paris,

05:53.876 --> 05:56.711
this is treating you
like a lady.

05:56.745 --> 06:00.131
I just flew into De Gaulle
an hour ago.

06:00.165 --> 06:03.417
We could discuss this
in person.

06:07.422 --> 06:11.392
But maybe you're busy, and I can
try you next time I'm in town.

06:11.426 --> 06:13.895
Are you tied up
this afternoon?

06:16.398 --> 06:19.150
I have a meeting,
but I could move it.

06:21.103 --> 06:23.321
So after we're done here,
are you going to vanish again?

06:23.355 --> 06:27.325
- [Chuckles]
- Hmm?

06:27.359 --> 06:30.328
I might stick around.
We'll see.

06:30.362 --> 06:32.780
You like being mysterious.

06:32.782 --> 06:34.949
Let's drink to that.

06:45.761 --> 06:49.297
[Cell phone ringing]
Mm.

06:49.348 --> 06:51.132
It's work.
Hmm.

06:51.183 --> 06:54.435
It's Martine.

06:54.469 --> 06:57.638
Uh, wait.
Hold on a second. Just--

06:57.640 --> 07:00.942
sure. Yeah, I can be
right there.

07:00.976 --> 07:03.945
Okay, I-I'll see you soon.

07:03.979 --> 07:05.313
My buyer's getting cold feet,

07:05.315 --> 07:07.448
and I'm counting on him
for 60 grand.

07:07.482 --> 07:09.450
What if you forget
about your buyer

07:09.484 --> 07:11.702
and spend tonight
with me instead?

07:11.737 --> 07:16.374
I will buy enough guns from you
to make up the difference.

07:16.408 --> 07:19.660
- I can't ask you to do that.
- Please, it's nothing.

07:19.662 --> 07:21.245
It would be my pleasure.

07:23.498 --> 07:25.499
I kind of got the impression
you were busy tonight.

07:25.501 --> 07:27.919
We have a cocktail party
right after this,

07:27.970 --> 07:30.254
but you can be my guest.

07:34.343 --> 07:36.177
All right.

07:36.228 --> 07:38.679
Where's the party?
Russian embassy.

07:41.433 --> 07:45.019
Let me, um, call my buyer
and tell him I can't make it.

Mm.

08:03.589 --> 08:06.207
Ivan just invited me to
a party at the Russian embassy.

08:06.258 --> 08:07.842
We'll be there
in about 30 minutes.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.845
I'm blown in Russia.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.631

through facial recognition,

08:13.682 --> 08:17.218

08:45.777 --> 08:47.361
It's barely enough time
for a patch job.

08:47.412 --> 08:49.330
That's why we're not
gonna crack it.

08:49.364 --> 08:51.365
We're gonna crash it.

11:25.070 --> 11:27.071
That Paris is nicer
than Siberia,

he would be stationed

11:28.907 --> 11:31.859

- Where are you guys going?
- We're eating in.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.596
We have to get our ducks
in a row

11:52.630 --> 11:53.881
for the upcoming deposition.

11:53.932 --> 11:55.132
Hope this doesn't mean
more trouble

11:55.183 --> 11:56.433
coming down from the DNI.

11:56.468 --> 11:58.218
Oh, Hayley Price is digging
into everything,

11:58.269 --> 12:01.472
even stuff that doesn't have
to do with Chicago.

12:01.523 --> 12:03.223
Well, you'll let me know
if I should be worried.

12:03.225 --> 12:04.725
- Will do.
- And you'll let me know

12:04.727 --> 12:06.360
if the situation on the ground
in Paris changes.

12:06.394 --> 12:07.561
I will.

12:13.785 --> 12:15.486
Who are all these people?

12:15.537 --> 12:19.907
All friends of the ambassador,
people important to Russia.

12:19.909 --> 12:21.458
Why am I here?

12:21.493 --> 12:24.411
Well,
you are important to me.

12:26.414 --> 12:28.382
[Speaking Russian]

12:28.416 --> 12:30.083
Whatever you said.

12:37.258 --> 12:39.476
Do you know the woman
standing behind you?

12:39.511 --> 12:42.095
She's staring at us.

12:42.147 --> 12:45.149
Ah, this is my friend,
Yana Starkov.

12:45.183 --> 12:48.235
She's FSB.

12:48.269 --> 12:50.154
She's going to want
to talk to you.

12:50.188 --> 12:51.188
Why?

12:51.239 --> 12:52.990
Because she is jealous
Russian woman,

12:53.024 --> 12:54.658
and she is my ex-girlfriend.

12:54.692 --> 12:57.327
Then maybe both of us
should stay away from her.

12:57.362 --> 12:59.530
Yes.

13:15.088 --> 13:17.088
I'm terrible.
Remind me of you name again.

13:17.113 --> 13:19.665
Martine Miller,
Browning Firearms.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.500
We met at the White House
correspondents' dinner.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.615
Right, of course.
I'm sorry.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.203
I'm just so bad
with names sometimes.

13:24.205 --> 13:26.672
I'm in sales, Mr. McQuaid.
I can't afford to be.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.006
This is Ryan McQuaid.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.209
I tried to sell his company
some weapons last year.

13:30.260 --> 13:33.045
Oh, some?
Try 5,000 P-35s.

13:33.047 --> 13:36.048
- Oh, so you do remember me.
- Ivan Kravec, Kredit Krepost.

13:36.099 --> 13:37.850
I've heard so much about you,
Mr. McQuaid.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.384
You should let me know
if your bank

13:39.386 --> 13:40.769
ever needs a security consult.

13:40.803 --> 13:43.555
I mean, you can never be
to careful these days.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.057
I'm starving. I'm gonna
get something to eat.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.775
Can I get you anything?

13:46.809 --> 13:49.561
No, thank you, darling.

13:49.612 --> 13:52.231
- Nice to see you, Martine.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.568
Ivan.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.802
[Camera shutter clicking]

14:18.091 --> 14:19.758
What are you doing here?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.426
I could ask
the same thing of you.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.728
The last time
we ran into each other,

14:22.762 --> 14:24.179
we were both
after the same thing,

14:24.230 --> 14:26.098
and we stepped on
each others' toes a lot.

14:26.149 --> 14:27.599
As I remember it,
I helped you get

14:27.601 --> 14:29.101
what you wanted in Venezuela.

14:29.152 --> 14:30.435
You got
what you wanted too,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.571
and don't think I forgot
about your hour with Borz.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.606
- [Scoffs]
- What are you doing here?

14:34.608 --> 14:35.691
I am here trying to procure

14:35.742 --> 14:37.776
a half dozen Russian
combat helicopters

14:37.778 --> 14:40.579
for the D.I.A. from a Russian
weapons contact of mine.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.415
Why?

14:43.449 --> 14:45.450
Because there are some places
in the world

14:45.501 --> 14:47.286
where American helicopters
are a Red Flag.

14:47.337 --> 14:49.288
That's where I come in.

14:49.290 --> 14:51.373
Now, how about you, Martine?

14:55.261 --> 14:57.629
What brings you here with...
I can't discuss that.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.798
Oh, I got it.
It's none of my business.

14:59.849 --> 15:03.852
Well, I am glad to see
that the trust works both ways.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.440
[Sighs]

15:11.894 --> 15:13.061
- Joan?
- Yes?

15:13.112 --> 15:14.146
You wanted to see me?

15:14.148 --> 15:16.148
- Yes. Any update on Annie?
- Yeah.

15:16.150 --> 15:19.484
She's been sending back
some encrypted pictures.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.320
I ran them
through facial recognition--

15:21.371 --> 15:23.038
mostly bureaucrats
and oligarchs,

15:23.072 --> 15:24.239
a few hits on the FSB.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.991
But nothing
on the terrorist front yet.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.994
And, uh, Ryan McQuaid is there,
apparently.

15:29.045 --> 15:31.296
McQuaid is at the embassy?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.215
Annie said he's buying
Russian attack helicopters

15:33.249 --> 15:34.249
for the D.I.A.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.751
I made a few calls.
It checks out.

15:35.802 --> 15:36.802
Huh.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.805
Is that all you need?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.557
Um, actually, I was hoping
to get your help

15:42.592 --> 15:45.260
on a personal matter.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.563
Of course.
What is it?

15:48.598 --> 15:51.433
Arthur had to go
out of the country last week

15:51.484 --> 15:53.852
for work,
somewhere in the Middle East.

15:53.903 --> 15:55.570
- Mm-hmm.
- Couldn't tell me where.

15:55.605 --> 15:56.938
It's a non-disclosure
agreement.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.440
It's nothing you're not used to.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.524
He hurt his shoulder,

15:59.575 --> 16:02.995
and he wouldn't tell me
how he did it.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.030
It probably
doesn't mean anything.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.366
Probably not, so help me
stop worrying about it.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.201
Will you reach out to some
of your military friends,

16:09.252 --> 16:10.952
see what you can find?
Sure.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.254
Give me some time.
Okay.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.292
What's next?

16:17.343 --> 16:18.710
Uh...

16:18.761 --> 16:21.680
Take a look
at the NCTC's deposition list.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.049
There were a couple of names
I wasn't familiar with.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.189
Michael Oates...

16:31.224 --> 16:32.891
He used to work
at Justice, I think.

16:32.942 --> 16:34.893
Okay.

16:34.944 --> 16:36.528
Uh...

16:36.562 --> 16:39.898
Damon Lee--he's a journalist.
I don't know him very well.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.710
Stephanie Banks...

16:51.744 --> 16:54.713
She's a civilian.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.548
Know her
from the D.C. party circuit.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.383
Okay.

17:00.837 --> 17:03.889
- These all seem kind of random.
- Yeah, I agree.

17:03.923 --> 17:07.925
Just wanted to make sure there
are no surprises in there.

17:17.653 --> 17:19.738
[Speaking Russian]

17:19.771 --> 17:22.991
Have you secured the connections
they discussed?

17:23.025 --> 17:25.444
- Yeah.
- Good.

17:25.494 --> 17:27.329
I enjoy working
with the Kazakhstanis.

17:27.363 --> 17:28.914
They have
a good sense of humor.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.939
[Camera shutter clicks]

17:53.973 --> 17:57.359
Roast duck is on the menu, too,
with the red cabbage.

17:57.393 --> 17:58.860
[Camera shutter clicks]

17:58.895 --> 18:01.363
[Speaking Russian]

18:01.397 --> 18:03.982
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry.
I don't speak Russian.

18:03.984 --> 18:07.319
I asked,
"what are you doing here?"

18:07.321 --> 18:09.621
You're the one who came
with Ivan, no?

18:09.655 --> 18:12.407
Yes.
I was just looking for him.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.993
Uh, Martine Miller.
And you are?

18:15.044 --> 18:17.162
Tatiana Starkov.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.749
You're American, no?
Have we met before?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.968
- I don't think so.
- You look familiar.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.970
Where are you from?

18:25.004 --> 18:28.340
St. Louis, but lately I feel
like I live out of my suitcase.

18:28.342 --> 18:31.009
[Laughs]

18:35.982 --> 18:37.983
Hey, no fair.
Speak English.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.986
Sorry.
I was about to leave, anyway.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.072
I hate Russian food.
[Chuckles]

18:44.106 --> 18:48.026
Nice meeting you, Martine.
Mmhmm.

18:48.077 --> 18:49.861
- I like her.
- No, you don't.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.697
She's a bitch.
I'm glad you found me.

18:52.748 --> 18:56.952
I've been thinking of nothing
but you the whole night.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.287
Let's go somewhere else.
This isn't very private.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.705
I know the people
on this floor.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.707
There's no one here.
Hmm?

19:02.758 --> 19:04.676
Hmm? Come.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.379
I want to show you something.

19:09.098 --> 19:11.216
Okay.
Thank you.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.968
Auggie.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.387
So, I, uh--
I made some calls.

19:15.389 --> 19:17.389
And it looks like
McQuaid's Security group

19:17.391 --> 19:19.724
was in a conflict
outside Ramadi last week.

19:19.775 --> 19:21.393
It wasn't
in our weekly briefings

19:21.395 --> 19:23.361
'cause they're
a private contractor, but...

19:23.396 --> 19:25.564
It looks like
it might have been Arthur.

19:25.615 --> 19:28.233
Do you know what happened?

19:28.284 --> 19:30.902
They hit an I.E.D.
Took fire from some insurgents.

19:30.953 --> 19:33.738
Ultimately,
no one was killed.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.491
[Sighs]

19:36.542 --> 19:38.710
I may be able to find
more details, if you want.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.746
No, that's all right.
Thank you for looking into it.

19:41.797 --> 19:44.082
Yeah, of course.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.917
Uh...

19:45.919 --> 19:48.920
Joan, this is none
of my business, I know...

19:48.922 --> 19:50.388
But these things
always sound worse

19:50.423 --> 19:52.424
when you hear them secondhand.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.264
[Both giggling]

20:03.603 --> 20:04.936
Come.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.329
You want to see a trick?

20:14.363 --> 20:17.115
Hmm? Yes?

20:17.166 --> 20:19.451
[Laughs]

20:19.502 --> 20:22.537
Are there glasses?

20:22.588 --> 20:23.788
[Laughs]

20:23.790 --> 20:25.590
Yes.
[Laughs]

20:25.625 --> 20:29.294
It's my friend Arkady's office.
I did him a favor, so...

20:29.345 --> 20:32.097
He lets me use it sometimes.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.266
Shouldn't we go back? They're
gonna wonder where we are.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.217
Let them wonder.
Mm?

20:36.269 --> 20:37.552
[Glasses clink]

20:37.603 --> 20:39.888
To you.
Mm?

20:41.891 --> 20:44.859
[Both exhale sharply, laugh]

20:47.363 --> 20:49.447
You are--oh.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.534
[Both laugh]

20:52.568 --> 20:53.818
[Gasps]

20:53.869 --> 20:57.322
Not who you say you are,
Martine Miller.

20:57.373 --> 21:01.326
Huh? [Laughing]
[Choking]

21:01.377 --> 21:04.996
Last time we were together,
you drugged me.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.134
- [Gasping]
- Yes, yes.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.887
[Struggling]

21:12.922 --> 21:16.758
GHB, yes?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.176
This is fun drug.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.844
Ivan, this is crazy.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.563
Now it's your turn, huh?

21:21.597 --> 21:23.848
Yes. Open mouth.
[Struggling]

21:23.850 --> 21:27.185
Open your mouth.
Yes, yes, yes.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.240
Yes. There we are.
[Laughs]

21:35.910 --> 21:37.867
[Gasping]
Okay.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.558
I'll tell you
everything you want--

21:40.609 --> 21:42.476
my name,
I'll tell you who I work for.

21:42.478 --> 21:44.145
Darling, no,
it's too late for that.

21:44.196 --> 21:45.813
I'm sorry.

22:00.462 --> 22:01.712
Oh.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.886
Hey.
What's going on?

22:08.920 --> 22:11.138
[Softly]
Help me.

22:14.977 --> 22:17.678
[Men speaking Russian
in the distance]

22:17.729 --> 22:19.730
Hey.

22:28.023 --> 22:30.358
What is it?

22:34.746 --> 22:36.580
I did something
I shouldn't one.

22:39.701 --> 22:42.503
I know about Ramadi.

22:44.506 --> 22:47.458
You were in a firefight.

22:47.509 --> 22:51.012
You could have died.
I'm sorry.

22:51.046 --> 22:54.548
You know I would have told you
if I could have.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.767
This isn't about secrets.
It's about Mack.

22:56.802 --> 22:59.687
It's--this just wasn't
the kind of thing

22:59.721 --> 23:01.722
I thought you'd be signing up
for right now.

23:01.773 --> 23:04.442
Oh, no. I didn't intend to go
into anything dangerous.

23:04.476 --> 23:06.360
But this one just...

23:06.395 --> 23:08.229
It ended up
beyond my control.

23:08.231 --> 23:11.232
Do you remember what you used
to say about PMCs like McQuaid?

23:11.283 --> 23:14.235
- [Sighs]
- That they put profit

23:14.286 --> 23:16.704
before patriotism?

23:16.738 --> 23:19.323
I don't want you dying...

23:19.374 --> 23:20.791
Because of profit.

23:20.826 --> 23:22.827
McQuaid doesn't work
like that.

23:22.878 --> 23:23.961
Well, I wouldn't know that

23:23.995 --> 23:26.080
because we can't talk
about McQuaid.

23:26.131 --> 23:28.382
I thought you said
this wasn't about the secrets.

23:28.417 --> 23:31.669
It's not.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.423
When you were DCS, we had plenty
of secrets between us.

23:35.474 --> 23:39.093
But it felt different,
because we were

23:39.095 --> 23:41.762
under the same roof,
working for the same people.

23:44.266 --> 23:46.267
I understand.

23:46.269 --> 23:50.237
Look, it's hard for me, too,
being outside the CIA.

23:50.272 --> 23:53.023
That place was my home
for 20 years.

23:58.163 --> 24:02.199
Okay, neither one of us
is getting enough sleep.

24:03.368 --> 24:05.169
We've got jobs
that are pulling us

24:05.203 --> 24:07.171
in two different directions.

24:07.205 --> 24:08.622
And at the end of the day,

24:08.624 --> 24:10.758
we can't even sit down
and talk about it,

24:10.792 --> 24:12.960
because I'm inside the agency--

24:13.011 --> 24:15.296
And I'm not.

24:17.632 --> 24:19.467
I've seen a lot of couples
face this sort of thing

24:19.469 --> 24:21.302
and lose.

24:28.610 --> 24:30.861
We're not just any couple.

24:33.865 --> 24:37.868
[Mack crying]

24:43.875 --> 24:46.827
[Knocking on door]

24:48.663 --> 24:50.714
Calder,
what are you doing here?

24:50.749 --> 24:53.083
We need to talk...

24:53.135 --> 24:56.170
Stephanie.

24:56.172 --> 24:58.005
Please come in.

25:00.175 --> 25:03.727
So you know my real name.

25:03.762 --> 25:06.430
Why don't you tell me
what you want?

25:06.481 --> 25:09.733
You're going to be deposed
in an upcoming investigation,

25:09.768 --> 25:12.520
and I need our relationship
to stay out of it.

25:12.571 --> 25:14.355
Investigation?

25:14.406 --> 25:17.408
By who?

25:17.442 --> 25:20.611
The office of the Director
of National Intelligence.

25:22.247 --> 25:25.699
Well, now I get how
you know my real name.

25:25.701 --> 25:27.418
You must have
an important job.

25:27.452 --> 25:29.453
[Chuckles]

25:29.504 --> 25:32.623
I'm not at liberty
to discuss where I work.

25:32.674 --> 25:34.041
I didn't ask.

25:37.879 --> 25:39.346
Can I trust you?

25:43.635 --> 25:45.719
You already know
I'm discreet.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.354
Yeah.

25:48.940 --> 25:53.277
But this is way bigger
than being just discreet.

25:54.563 --> 25:56.981
If you work in the world
I think you do,

25:57.032 --> 25:59.733
then you probably already
looked into my records.

25:59.735 --> 26:03.237
You know I can cover my tracks.

26:03.239 --> 26:06.657
You chose me for a reason.

26:06.708 --> 26:09.460
Trust your judgment.

26:10.912 --> 26:13.914
Okay.

26:13.916 --> 26:18.719
Now, why do I get the sense
there's more going on with you?

26:18.753 --> 26:22.423
What is it?

26:22.474 --> 26:25.759
What did you hope would happen
when you came here?

26:25.810 --> 26:26.894
Mm!

26:30.932 --> 26:34.101
[Door closes,
footsteps approaching]

26:36.104 --> 26:39.106
[Groaning softly]

26:49.951 --> 26:52.786
[Gasps]

26:54.789 --> 26:56.790
You are CIA, yes?

27:04.261 --> 27:05.665
<i>You're always fussin' with that.</i>

27:05.690 --> 27:07.090
The man stands in the doorway,

27:07.091 --> 27:08.524
loading and checking
his revolver.

27:08.559 --> 27:09.776
- She's the killer.
- [Laughs]

27:09.810 --> 27:11.144
I'm 100% certain.

27:11.195 --> 27:13.062
Do you want me
spoil it for you?

27:13.113 --> 27:15.565
Incoming call--Hayley.

27:15.616 --> 27:16.950
Why is she calling?

27:16.984 --> 27:18.651
Didn't you break up with her?
Incoming call-Hayley.

27:18.702 --> 27:20.203
[Sighs]

27:20.237 --> 27:22.205
I haven't had a chance
to talk with her yet.

27:22.239 --> 27:24.457
...and puts on his jacket
to leave.

27:24.491 --> 27:26.626
Good-bye, sweetheart.

27:26.660 --> 27:29.128
- Talk to her now, then.
- Are you serious?

27:29.163 --> 27:31.914
You're avoiding it.
So get it out of the way.

27:34.501 --> 27:35.551
Okay.

27:35.586 --> 27:37.387
[Cell phone beeps]
Hayley.

27:37.421 --> 27:39.756
Hey.
Is, uh--is this a bad time?

27:39.758 --> 27:41.758
No.
No, it's fine.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.894
Because I'm actually
right outside your apartment.

27:44.928 --> 27:47.096
Sorry. I know it's--
it's a bit stalker-y

27:47.098 --> 27:48.648
to just show up like this,

27:48.682 --> 27:50.099
but I-I need to talk to you
about something.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.517
Can I come up?

27:51.568 --> 27:53.069
You know what? I'm just
walking out the door right now,

27:53.103 --> 27:54.437
but I've got time for a beer.

27:54.488 --> 27:57.106
Okay. If it's--if it's,
uh, not a big deal.

27:57.157 --> 27:59.692
That's great.
I'll be right down.

27:59.743 --> 28:01.744
So you're going
for a beer with her?

28:01.779 --> 28:03.613
There's beer here.

28:03.664 --> 28:05.281
Yeah.

28:05.332 --> 28:08.918
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.

28:08.952 --> 28:10.370
Let me go handle this.

28:10.421 --> 28:12.872
Sure, by all means.

28:19.797 --> 28:22.799
Oh.
Thank you.

28:22.850 --> 28:24.801
Cheers.

28:24.803 --> 28:27.720
So...

28:27.771 --> 28:30.056
What was so important
that you had to come down

28:30.107 --> 28:31.974
and talk to me in person
tonight?

28:31.976 --> 28:34.227
Well, as part of my
investigation into Chicago,

28:34.278 --> 28:36.312
I've been looking
at your friend Annie.

28:36.363 --> 28:38.314
I know you guys are close,
but there's some stuff

28:38.365 --> 28:40.950
from her recent past
that seems pretty suspicious.

28:40.984 --> 28:44.153
Well, whatever it is,
I'm sure she has a good reason.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.122
I've been learning
about a few of those things.

28:46.156 --> 28:47.874
Did you know that after
her time off,

28:47.908 --> 28:50.493
she ditched her CIA minder,
went off-book?

28:50.544 --> 28:52.211
Okay.

28:52.246 --> 28:54.330
Well, that's not exactly
criminal behavior.

28:54.381 --> 28:56.666
Maybe, but I've done enough
of these investigations

28:56.717 --> 28:59.886
to know that if somebody
is keeping secrets from the CIA,

28:59.920 --> 29:02.255
it is never a good sign.

29:04.174 --> 29:06.392
Thank you for telling me.

29:06.427 --> 29:09.512
But you didn't need to come
all the way down here to do it.

29:11.315 --> 29:14.934
Maybe I just wanted
to see you.

29:14.985 --> 29:17.854
I think we have something,
Auggie.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.439
I don't want to mess it up.

29:19.490 --> 29:20.573
But I have to do my job,

29:20.607 --> 29:22.358
so I wanted to tell you
in person

29:22.360 --> 29:24.827
so that you didn't hear it
from the rumor mill.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.696
I appreciate that.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.247
This might sound
kind of harsh,

29:28.282 --> 29:31.033
but I think you need to distance
yourself from Annie.

29:31.085 --> 29:32.285
Just because she might go down

29:32.336 --> 29:34.537
doesn't mean you have
to go down with her.

29:40.544 --> 29:44.347
No, this is a huge mistake.
I'm not in the CIA.

29:44.381 --> 29:46.015
Stop, huh?

29:46.049 --> 29:47.517
I knew you were
foreign intelligence

29:47.551 --> 29:49.435
after you drugged me.

29:49.470 --> 29:50.553
I took you to the embassy.

29:50.604 --> 29:55.057
My friend Yana
is FSB counter-espionage.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.976
She knows Americans.

29:57.027 --> 30:00.613
[Speaking Russian]

30:00.647 --> 30:02.532
- Where are we going?
- You're going to Moscow--

30:02.566 --> 30:06.369
Lefortovo Prison, where the FSB
keep their top interrogators.

30:06.403 --> 30:08.738
But you already knew that.

30:08.740 --> 30:12.458
- I'm just a gun salesman.
- Oh, I will miss your spirit.

30:12.493 --> 30:14.494
I regret that I won't be
the one to break you,

30:14.545 --> 30:15.912
but I assure you

30:15.914 --> 30:19.632
it will be done
by the best, hmm?

30:19.666 --> 30:22.919
Here's Yana.
Too bad.

30:28.559 --> 30:31.477
Aah!

30:31.512 --> 30:34.263
Ivan, let her go!

30:34.265 --> 30:37.600
If you follow us,
she will die!

30:37.651 --> 30:39.152
[Gunshots]

30:45.275 --> 30:46.909
As long as everything's
out in the open,

30:46.944 --> 30:48.327
do you want to tell me
about Chicago?

30:48.362 --> 30:49.882
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:49.913 --> 30:51.164
Ah, I think you do.

30:51.198 --> 30:53.833
A bank account under your name
in the bank that you run

30:53.867 --> 30:57.453
helped fund a terror attack
on U.S. soil.

30:57.504 --> 30:59.789
Or didn't you know what
your money was being used for?

30:59.791 --> 31:00.957
You're annoying me.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.458
You think
I'm the last CIA operative

31:02.460 --> 31:03.626
that's gonna come for you?

31:03.628 --> 31:05.428
You get rid of me,
and more will come.

31:05.462 --> 31:07.463
You'll be a fugitive.

31:28.202 --> 31:30.987
[Gun clicks]
Aah!

32:04.354 --> 32:07.573
[Gunshot]

32:07.608 --> 32:09.191
[Spits]

32:12.279 --> 32:15.531
[Breathing heavily]

32:22.300 --> 32:25.302
[Rustling]

32:36.097 --> 32:37.648
What's the news on Ivan?

32:37.682 --> 32:39.600
Sweep team said
he's gonna live.

32:39.602 --> 32:42.236
Good.

32:42.270 --> 32:44.938
It'd be a waste of all this
if he died.

32:46.941 --> 32:49.193
I don't have a towel,
but, uh, it's--it's okay.

32:49.244 --> 32:51.995
It's clean. It...

32:52.030 --> 32:54.832
[Laughs]

32:54.866 --> 32:57.784
Forget about it. The wet look
kind of works for you, anyway.

33:07.128 --> 33:08.629
You okay to walk from here?

33:08.680 --> 33:10.297
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:10.348 --> 33:11.965
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:14.135 --> 33:15.435
Whoa.

33:15.470 --> 33:16.470
This way.

33:16.471 --> 33:18.805
Oh.
[Chuckles]

33:25.146 --> 33:26.613
You're lucky I'm a good shot,

33:26.648 --> 33:28.615
or the sweep team would have
been picking up a body,

33:28.650 --> 33:30.651
instead of a potential source
of information.

33:30.702 --> 33:33.320
- What the hell happened to you?
- Happened?

33:33.371 --> 33:35.455
I saved you.
You're welcome.

33:35.490 --> 33:37.658
But I remember seeing you
before I collapsed.

33:37.709 --> 33:38.709
Where did you go?

33:38.743 --> 33:40.210
Ivan started to wake up.

33:40.245 --> 33:43.163
I couldn't exactly just carry
you out without getting noticed.

33:43.214 --> 33:44.414
Oh, so you let him take me.

33:44.465 --> 33:45.716
The FSB sends

33:45.750 --> 33:47.790
all its high-value interrogation
suspects to Moscow,

33:47.802 --> 33:49.219
so I knew I had some time
to intercept you

33:49.254 --> 33:51.088
before they dragged you
out of the country.

33:51.139 --> 33:52.839
It was taking kind of
a big risk with my life.

33:52.841 --> 33:54.975
Okay, look...

33:55.009 --> 33:56.677
I'm sorry
I didn't have more time

33:56.728 --> 34:00.180
to think of a better plan.

34:00.231 --> 34:02.099
But I did save you.

34:04.235 --> 34:06.436
Thanks.

34:08.022 --> 34:10.690
Kravec is en route
to a stateside holding facility.

34:10.742 --> 34:12.359
I'm heading up
the interrogation team.

34:12.409 --> 34:14.027
If he's part of a larger
terrorist network,

34:14.078 --> 34:15.329
I'll find out.

34:15.362 --> 34:17.864
Do you honestly think the FSB
could be behind Chicago?

34:17.916 --> 34:19.366
I'm not ruling anything out.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.284
We should muster
all our available resources

34:21.335 --> 34:22.753
on Russia too.

34:22.786 --> 34:25.107
We need someone who knows all
of the players on the ground.

34:25.123 --> 34:28.091
I might have a lead on that.

34:28.126 --> 34:31.929
An opportunity has come up,
and I thought of you.

34:31.963 --> 34:34.764
It could get complicated,

34:34.799 --> 34:36.132
but I sincerely think

34:36.184 --> 34:39.268
you're the best person
for the job.

34:39.304 --> 34:40.554
There's no one I trust more.

34:40.556 --> 34:41.688
Hey, Calder.

34:41.723 --> 34:43.940
You were right
about those depositions--

34:43.975 --> 34:45.225
random.

34:45.275 --> 34:46.726
- What do you mean?
- They pulled in half

34:46.777 --> 34:48.728
the guests
from the I.M.P. Awards dinner--

34:48.731 --> 34:50.731
no connection
to the investigation.

34:50.782 --> 34:53.367
I mean, they must be
really grasping at straws.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.985
It's nice to hear
some good news.

34:55.036 --> 34:56.402
Listen,
I'm swamped through Sunday.

34:56.405 --> 34:59.573
But dinner next week, I hope?
You know, about that...

34:59.575 --> 35:03.243
I'm flattered...

35:03.245 --> 35:06.079
But I'm not so sure
it's a good idea--

35:06.130 --> 35:08.415
us dating while
we're working together.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.584
Okay, got it.

35:10.635 --> 35:12.753
No, you...

35:12.755 --> 35:15.422
I-I think you're amazing.
It's me.

35:15.424 --> 35:17.591
I'm just trying to keep my life
from getting too complicated.

35:17.642 --> 35:19.059
Oh.

35:19.093 --> 35:21.762
I should have known better than
to ask a guy out in an elevator.

35:21.764 --> 35:23.897
Oh, no, come on.

35:23.931 --> 35:25.932
[Elevator bell dings]

35:25.934 --> 35:28.602
Take care
of yourself, Calder.

35:32.106 --> 35:33.657
Does this technically count
as nepotism--

35:33.691 --> 35:36.910
you hiring McQuaid to provide
information on the FSB?

35:36.944 --> 35:39.329
I prefer to look at it
as serendipity.

35:39.364 --> 35:42.616
The fact that you're
my husband--that's just a bonus.

35:42.618 --> 35:45.118
For you and me both.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.621
It's nice working
inside the CIA again.

35:47.672 --> 35:49.790
Well, don't think this means
I'm not gonna be tough on you.

35:49.841 --> 35:51.375
I know you too well
to think that.

35:51.426 --> 35:53.844
Is that Arthur I hear?

35:53.878 --> 35:55.345
Nice to have you
back on board.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.014
It's good
to be back, Auggie.

35:57.048 --> 36:00.100
Joan, I need to talk to you
about something.

36:00.134 --> 36:01.852
So let me get this straight.

36:01.886 --> 36:04.388
You didn't break up
with Hayley?

36:04.439 --> 36:06.773
Can't break up with Hayley.
She's investigating Annie.

36:06.808 --> 36:07.891
And you don't want to lose her

36:07.942 --> 36:09.476
as a potential
source of information.

36:09.478 --> 36:11.561
If the DNI came after Annie
and I could help--

36:11.612 --> 36:14.448
But you're dating
someone else?

36:14.482 --> 36:16.566
A civilian.

36:16.617 --> 36:18.902
Mm-hmm.

36:18.953 --> 36:21.488
Well, I think you know
what my advice is gonna be,

36:21.539 --> 36:23.790
which is probably why
you asked me in the first place.

36:23.825 --> 36:25.909
Keep Hayley close.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.328
If she's taking aim
at one of us,

36:28.330 --> 36:31.331
it's better
that we know first.

36:31.382 --> 36:32.466
Yeah.

36:38.473 --> 36:40.674
I should go.

36:40.725 --> 36:41.758
You're welcome to stay.

36:41.809 --> 36:43.009
I mean, the place is enormous.

36:43.011 --> 36:46.012
It's honestly a waste
for just one person.

36:46.014 --> 36:48.265
Ryan, I don't need
looking after.

36:48.316 --> 36:51.601
- You can look after me.
- [Laughs]

36:51.652 --> 36:53.687
You definitely
don't need looking after.

36:53.738 --> 36:56.690
Everyone needs looking after.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.525
There's no talking to you
sometimes.

36:58.527 --> 36:59.693
Look, the way I see it,

36:59.744 --> 37:01.778
you and I
make a pretty good team.

37:01.829 --> 37:03.113
I don't need a team.

37:03.164 --> 37:05.949
[Scoffs]

37:06.000 --> 37:07.367
Has it ever occurred to you

37:07.418 --> 37:11.171
that being close to someone
could be a good thing?

37:11.205 --> 37:12.255
If I didn't like you so much,

37:12.290 --> 37:14.341
you might not be alive
right now.

37:17.545 --> 37:20.597
[Sighs]

37:20.631 --> 37:21.882
When I first joined the Navy,

37:21.933 --> 37:24.217
I was sent on a combat mission
in Somalia

37:24.268 --> 37:27.220
with a bunch of guys
I didn't know, so...

37:27.271 --> 37:29.139
I didn't trust them.

37:29.190 --> 37:31.641
And we'd sleep in shifts,

37:31.692 --> 37:35.779
always someone standing guard,
but I was too nervous to sleep,

37:35.813 --> 37:38.565
so I took every shift.

37:38.616 --> 37:40.400
After a while,
I was just too tired.

37:40.451 --> 37:42.369
I conked out.

37:42.403 --> 37:44.204
When I woke up,
the guy who was on watch--

37:44.238 --> 37:47.707
he said to me, "you have
to trust people eventually."

37:49.710 --> 37:51.244
Then why don't you trust me
enough to tell me

37:51.295 --> 37:52.746
about your hour with Borz?

37:57.919 --> 38:01.421
There's a mole
in my organization.

38:01.423 --> 38:05.342
Somebody's using my resources
to pass classified secrets.

38:06.677 --> 38:09.763
And I thought that Borz
might know about it, but...

38:09.765 --> 38:11.515
He was close to some people
when he worked for me

38:11.566 --> 38:12.933
that were involved.

38:12.935 --> 38:14.484
That's what
you couldn't tell me?

38:14.519 --> 38:16.987
I run a company that has
several hundred million dollars

38:17.021 --> 38:18.905
in federal contracts,

38:18.940 --> 38:23.443
based in part on the fact
that I can keep secrets.

38:23.445 --> 38:26.580
Anyone finds out
that I have a mole, I'm ruined.

38:26.614 --> 38:28.949
Those contracts are gone,
and the thousands of people

38:29.000 --> 38:31.418
who depend on me
lose their jobs.

38:33.704 --> 38:35.589
If I have a mole,
I need to find him myself

38:35.623 --> 38:37.090
before anyone else does.

38:42.847 --> 38:45.882
Did you find him yet?

38:45.933 --> 38:47.934
Not yet, but I will.

38:57.645 --> 39:00.814
[Chuckles]

39:05.870 --> 39:08.872
[Cell phone ringing]

39:10.324 --> 39:12.492
Hey, what happened
with your emergency at work?

39:12.543 --> 39:14.628
I'm kind of still
in the middle of it.

39:14.662 --> 39:18.131
- So you won't be home?
- No.

39:18.165 --> 39:19.966
And we need to talk.

39:20.001 --> 39:22.886
It's about Hayley.
She's not just gonna go away.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.171
I don't understand. You still
didn't break up with her?

39:25.223 --> 39:27.724
She is investigating me,
my friends,

39:27.758 --> 39:30.093
people that I care about,
and if she finds out about you,

39:30.144 --> 39:32.012
you're gonna go to prison
for a long time.

39:32.063 --> 39:34.014
So I can't break up
with her right now.

39:34.065 --> 39:35.682
I got to play this out.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.183
"Play this out"?

39:37.235 --> 39:39.486
What kind of sick spy bullshit
is this?

39:39.520 --> 39:43.073
I know how it sounds, but I'm
telling you the truth, Tash.

39:43.107 --> 39:45.325
I am with you, not her.

39:45.359 --> 39:47.861
If I want to protect you,
I've got to keep her close.

39:47.912 --> 39:49.029
Do you understand?

39:52.500 --> 39:55.001
Tash, say something.

39:55.036 --> 39:56.503
What do you want me to say?

39:56.537 --> 39:59.122
I want to say
that you hear me.

39:59.173 --> 40:01.091
I hear you.

40:01.125 --> 40:03.627
I have to go.

40:05.129 --> 40:06.713
Auggie.

40:06.715 --> 40:07.931
- Hey.
- You ready?

40:07.965 --> 40:09.549
Yeah, I'm ready.

40:09.551 --> 40:12.769
I'm really glad you called.

40:12.803 --> 40:16.523
Is everything okay?
Couldn't be better.

40:21.445 --> 40:25.448
[Moaning]

40:36.377 --> 40:38.712
Both: Mm.

40:38.746 --> 40:42.799
That was fun.
[Laughs]

40:42.833 --> 40:45.835
I'm so glad we're back on.

40:47.838 --> 40:51.808
You proved
I could trust you.

40:51.842 --> 40:54.010
For now.
