00:01.800 --> 00:03.495
Previously, on The Good Wife:

00:03.530 --> 00:04.565
_ This is_ Derrigk's
In-house Investigator,

00:04.600 --> 00:07.489
Blake, from, uh, DC.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.098
BLAKE:
You a friend of Leela's?

00:09.140 --> 00:10.232
I'm a who?

00:10.270 --> 00:12.101
Um, sorry. Kalinda's.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.300
Whatever games you're
playing, you play with her.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.739
I'm too busy, okay?

00:14.780 --> 00:16.805
You know there was something
weird about that case,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.670
that something
got buried. Pitted.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.372
Evidence. Or testimony.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.749
to convict someone

00:25.790 --> 00:26.586
for the Northbrook
killings, weren't you?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.656
It's my job to
prosecute criminals,

00:33.560 --> 00:36.529
ALICIA:
Mr. Childs, you were
under intense pressure

00:36.570 --> 00:38.094
to convict someone

00:38.130 --> 00:39.666
for the Northbrook
killings, weren't you?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.167
GLENN: It's my job to
prosecute criminals.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.633
There's always pressure.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.501
ALICIA:
Did you give an interview
on June 11th,

00:44.540 --> 00:49.148
promising "swift accountability
and justice" for the sniper?

00:49.180 --> 00:50.442
GLENN:
I don't recall.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.846
ALICIA:
Chicago Tribune, op-ed:
"Chicagoans need not fear,

00:52.880 --> 00:55.519
this case will be solved by
the end of the month"?

00:55.550 --> 00:56.346
GLENN:
And it was.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.846
ALICIA:
Even if corners were cut?

00:57.890 --> 00:59.517
GLENN:
They were not.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.585
ALICIA:
You may not have
been aware they were.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.088
GLENN:
This is my department. I have
to be aware of everything.

01:04.130 --> 01:06.155
And I am.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.169
ALICIA:
You had Wyatt Stevens arrested?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.326
GLENN:
Wyatt Stevens was arrested

01:10.370 --> 01:12.190
because Wyatt Stevens
was guilty.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.128
ALICIA (on tape):
You stand by the prosecution
of Wyatt Stevens.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.592
GLENN (on tape):
I stand by every prosecution

01:15.640 --> 01:17.267
this office has
taken on In my tenure.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.778
Unlike earlier holders of
my office, I do not prosecute

01:19.810 --> 01:22.142
without a good faith belief
that the defendant is guilty.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.199
PETER:
I think you're right.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.218
Go with "unfair prejudice."

01:27.250 --> 01:28.808
My co-counsel wants to go with

01:28.850 --> 01:31.284
prejudice and
cumulative evidence.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.311
No, no, no, no,
not with Judge Hale.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.851
She hates a fire hose defense.

01:35.890 --> 01:38.120
But this is good.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.718
"Prejudice as policy."

01:39.760 --> 01:42.297
That's a very nice
turn of phrase.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.422
Thank you.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.139
It's a good
403 separation.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.535
(phone rings)
Okay. I'll look into it.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.630
What's up, Eli?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.635
Alicia, don't leave yet.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.170
I'm late for work.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.199
Just wait a second, Eli.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.309
Um, the settlement
in the, in the sniper case,

01:58.350 --> 02:00.238
the Northbrook sniper?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.817
Did... did you depose Childs?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.713
Um... Peter, I can't.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.250
I'm under a gag order.

02:08.290 --> 02:11.157
I can't say anything.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.154
Is it bad?

02:23.210 --> 02:24.438
So am I
supposed to worry

02:24.470 --> 02:25.767
they're still
asking for $8 million?

02:25.810 --> 02:27.402
Yep.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.839
Javier, you
wouldn't be happy

02:28.880 --> 02:31.269
unless you had
something to worry about.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.278
Look, we've got
a good judge,

02:33.320 --> 02:34.673
a good motion,

02:34.720 --> 02:36.449
and_we succeeded in
combining our defenses,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.446
so we can't be used
against each other.

02:38.490 --> 02:39.514
Okay.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.915
I just... this is getting to me.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.848
Once more into
the breach, eh?
Yep.

02:43.890 --> 02:47.189
I'd like to argue the unfair
prejudice motion, Andre.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.390
Certainly.
And I'll take cumulative.

02:48.430 --> 02:52.969
Actually, I was thinking we'd
be stronger with just one.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.433
Judge Hale doesn't like
a fire hose defense.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.859
Really. And how
do we know that?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.263
BAILIFF:
All rise.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.675
Good morning.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.598
Judge Hale has been called away
for a family emergency,

03:03.650 --> 03:05.902
so I will be presiding.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.611
We'll be hearing pretrial
motions today?

03:07.650 --> 03:08.776
DEERFIELD:
That's right, Your Honor.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.448
And if I may say so,
welcome aboard.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.355
QUINN:
Well, thank you, Mr. Deerfield.

03:13.390 --> 03:14.948
We got you out of the
lecture room, I see.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.254
Only to argue a case
I believe in.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.326
And yet I seem to see
you're outnumbered today.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.227
Yes, yes.
I do feel a bit like David.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.694
I think that's a bit of
a stretch, Mr. Deerfield.

03:25.730 --> 03:26.799
(chortles)

03:28.740 --> 03:30.435
I found something
to worry about.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.431
(techno music playing)

03:41.320 --> 03:43.311
BERLIN (on video):
Chicago!

03:43.350 --> 03:44.988
Move it, Chicago!

03:48.660 --> 03:50.287
What happened
to Hale?

03:50.330 --> 03:52.389
Some family emergency. Do you
know anything about Quinn?

03:52.430 --> 03:53.590
I'll see what I can get.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.996
(screaming on video)

03:57.930 --> 04:00.262
(panicked screams)

04:00.300 --> 04:03.030
BERLIN (on video):
Can we get some medical
attention down here?

04:03.070 --> 04:05.334
(screaming continues)

04:10.010 --> 04:13.446
(clamoring, crying)

04:15.080 --> 04:17.344
Your Honor, that
is cell phone video

04:17.390 --> 04:19.039
of the death of five
young concertgoers.

04:19.090 --> 04:19.886
It is essential evidence--

04:19.920 --> 04:21.319
ALICIA:
It is prejudicial evidence.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.328
Well, how is it prejudicial?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.850
The families are
sumg two people.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.927
Jay Hawke, AKA
D.J. Javier Berlin,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.518
for overselling
his concert,

04:29.570 --> 04:32.596
and Mr. Brownback's
security firm

04:32.640 --> 04:34.039
for allowing too many people in.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.300
At the very minimum,

04:36.340 --> 04:37.705
this video shows
an oversold concert.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.059
ALICIA:
No, at the very minimum,

04:39.110 --> 04:42.307
it shows a selectively edited,
highly prejudicial video

04:42.350 --> 04:43.703
intended to inflame the jury.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.706
Counselor... _
what are you wearing?

04:48.820 --> 04:50.310
Your Honor?
What are
you wearing?

04:50.350 --> 04:52.045
What... what are those clothes?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.320
I think they're Ralph Lauren.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.327
QUINN:
Yes, thank you.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.363
No, I mean... your pants.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.527
You're... you're wearing pants.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.561
Yes... It's a pantsuit.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.567
I see that.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.498
In my courtroom,

05:08.540 --> 05:11.600
I require the male
lawyers to wear ties,

05:11.640 --> 05:14.006
and the female lavwers, skirts.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.645
Am I making myself clear?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.545
I can't believe it.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.979
Does he do this in every court?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.647
He can't do this
to every female lawyer.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.647
My guess is you're right.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.510
So why me?
What did I do?

05:24.550 --> 05:25.983
You're being taxed.

05:27.020 --> 05:27.987
Why?

05:28.020 --> 05:29.521
The Childs deposition.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.619
What's going on?
Peter mentioned that, too.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.355
It was in McGowan's
column this morning.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.356
The deposition? How?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.129
It was leaked.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.364
And they think
I leaked it.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.628
To hurt Childs
and help Peter.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.558
That's the spin
in the column.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.703
Look, you're his wife,

05:42.740 --> 05:44.958
one of the only few
people in the room...

05:45.010 --> 05:46.807
ALICIA:
We didn't win a single motion.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.138
I'm meeting with
our co-counsel now

05:49.180 --> 05:50.579
to rethink strategy.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.009
So what's
our endgame?

05:52.050 --> 05:53.517
We want to keep our
client's exposure

05:53.550 --> 05:56.018
to the insurance limit:
half a million.

05:56.050 --> 05:59.019
I don't imagine the plaintiff
will accept a half million?

05:59.050 --> 06:00.688
Not after today.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.426
Okay. Do the best you can;

06:02.460 --> 06:04.758
anything to get
the settlement down.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.428
Uh, do you need Blake on this?

06:06.460 --> 06:08.599
No, no...
Kalinda's good.

06:08.630 --> 06:10.598
Oh, Alicia,
one more thing.

06:10.630 --> 06:14.589
Regarding this, uh,
leaked deposition.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.666
I had nothing
to do with it.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.166
All three of
us were there.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.735
It's just that...

06:21.780 --> 06:23.998
the firm is in a _
precarious p05ition on this,

06:24.050 --> 06:26.575
so it would be helpful

06:26.620 --> 06:28.417
if your husband
didn't exploit it.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.889
Okay.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.451
If you have
any sway there.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.458
Mm-hmm.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.599
She didn't do it?

06:40.630 --> 06:41.619
It's unlike her.

06:44.230 --> 06:47.097
Uh, you phoned: my co-counsel,
Mr. Baylon, is here?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.767
NAN_CY:
Hi.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.939
Hello. I didn't know
it was you.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.131
Miss Crozier.
Yes.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.477
Remember, from last year.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.546
We were on opposite sides.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.877
I do.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.049
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.638
I've forgotten your name.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.545
Alicia.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.455
Alicia, right.
Mm-hmm.

07:06.490 --> 07:10.187
That's so funny; we'll be
on the same side this time.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.185
I don't understand.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.322
I've been asked to

07:12.360 --> 07:15.750
replace Mr.Baylon as the
counsel for the security firm?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.097
He's having some surgery.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.859
He's... _
no, I-I just saw him.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.697
I know. It was all
very last-minute.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.935
It's-- I-- we're all
kind of shocked.

07:22.970 --> 07:26.474
But I'm here...
and raring to go.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.705
ALICIA:
Courtney...

07:28.740 --> 07:30.879
get Mr. Baylon
on the phone.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.878
Deviated septum.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.718
He gets elective surgery
one day before the trial

07:35.750 --> 07:38.139
because he doesn't
like the judge.

07:38.190 --> 07:40.215
Oh, Alicia, he said
you were expecting him,

07:40.260 --> 07:42.524
so I put him
in your office.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.554
Hello.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.228
You seem to spend
more time here

07:47.260 --> 07:49.990
than you did when you
actually worked here.

07:50.030 --> 07:50.997
You still sharing Courtney?

07:51.030 --> 07:51.997
Everything's the same.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.065
Okay.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.239
Well, I don't want
to delay the drama.

07:55.270 --> 07:56.498
You've been served.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.098
I've... For what?

07:58.140 --> 08:00.131
State's attorney has asked
me to head up an inquiry

08:00.180 --> 08:02.068
to look into the leak of
Mr. Childs' deposition.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.146
Now, I'm going to try
and expedite this, Alicia,

08:04.180 --> 08:06.614
so that you don't have a
cloud hanging over your head.

08:06.650 --> 08:07.275
Thank you so much.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.983
You're welcome.

08:11.020 --> 08:14.251
Personally, I know that you
would never break the law

08:14.290 --> 08:17.259
in this manner, so I'm sure
it's just a formality.

08:17.290 --> 08:21.249
And if it's not, then we'll be
pursuing a disbarment hearing.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.495
See you soon.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.169
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

08:48.320 --> 08:50.880
You're not getting
anything from me, Eli.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.227
I'm not burning my source.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.625
Source?

08:53.660 --> 08:55.924
Or sources.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.736
You know why
I love politics?

09:00.770 --> 09:02.192
People make sense.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.332
They do things
that make sense.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.703
That's why this leak bothers me.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.129
It doesn't make
any strategic sense.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.205
It hurts Childs, because it
makes his office look bad.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.344
It hurts Peter, because it
places his wife under suspicion,

09:14.380 --> 09:18.714
and then I realized:
that's the point.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.183
Someone wants to hurt them both.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.654
And that got me thinking.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.681
Childs and Florrick
have their hands

09:24.730 --> 09:25.879
around each other's throats.

09:25.930 --> 09:29.798
What a perfect time for a
third person to enter the race.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.067
So who is it?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.067
Give me a quote.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.761
I'll see if they
want to respond.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.199
They?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.059
Give me a quote.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.238
I'll see if he, she,
it wants to respond.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.372
"These kind of dirty tricks--

09:42.410 --> 09:46.369
even if perpetrated by an
unannounced third candidate--

09:46.410 --> 09:48.617
are despicable."

09:49.650 --> 09:50.639
Got it.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.754
She had my hand.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.382
I told her,

09:57.430 --> 10:01.696
"Whatever you do, don't let go."

10:01.730 --> 10:03.994
And that's her?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.892
My fiance. Yes.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.760
PAUL:
Juliette.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.631
The crowd was just so--

10:10.670 --> 10:13.605
It was like fighting the ocean.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.299
PAUL:
I couldn't hold her.

10:16.340 --> 10:19.741
She went down.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.840
Parents wanted an
open casket, but...

10:24.190 --> 10:26.181
the way she was trampled...

10:28.820 --> 10:30.981
I didn't know a person
could look like that.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.248
I'm sorry, Mr. Dylan,
but I need you to be strong

10:33.300 --> 10:34.289
for a little while longer,

10:34.330 --> 10:36.764
because the defense has to
ask you a few questions.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.767
ALICIA:
Objection!

10:37.800 --> 10:40.268
Sure. If you want.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.838
QUINN:
Sustained. Your witness.

10:43.870 --> 10:47.101
Mr. Dylan, I'm very
sorry for your loss.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.402
_ DEERFIELD:
Wish your clients were.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.704
I think they are.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.705
Speaking of my clients,

10:51.750 --> 10:53.672
they weren't the first
ones you sued, were they?

10:53.720 --> 10:54.675
Objection! Your Honor!

10:54.720 --> 10:57.188
Approach the bench.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.856
Your Honor, the
plaintiff first tried

11:00.890 --> 11:02.778
to sue the real
culprit: the venue.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.888
Oh, come on.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.251
The venue staff opened
the exit doors.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.450
That's what
sparked the stampede

11:07.500 --> 11:09.388
and the only reason
we're being sued

11:09.430 --> 11:11.466
is because the venue _went
bankrupt after the inCIdent.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.933
These are
honorable people.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.369
I'm not going
to stand by silently

11:14.400 --> 11:15.867
and let her
disparage them.

11:15.900 --> 11:16.901
I-I'm sorry.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.009
Is that an argument?
Your Honor,

11:18.040 --> 11:21.737
who my client sued or failed
to sue is immaterial here.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.907
They are suing
the codefendants now.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.178
That's all that matters.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.246
The objection
is sustained.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.339
Further questions of any

11:29.380 --> 11:31.883
previous suit
is off-limits.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.911
Now, step back.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.726
I said, step back.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.229
So, is my skirt short enough?

11:44.770 --> 11:49.434
Next time, ask that in front
of the court reporter, ma'am.

11:49.470 --> 11:52.268
And we will discuss
an appropriate fine.

11:52.310 --> 11:55.279
Now, step back.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.816
Put me in, coach.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.871
*

12:47.600 --> 12:49.158
Our strategy was
to blame the venue

12:49.200 --> 12:51.168
on the panic.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.998
We can't blame security because
they're our co-defendant.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.065
There's someone else
you can blame.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.067
VVho?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.099
The victims.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.506
Do you have
a problem with that?

13:02.610 --> 13:05.579
It's a rave.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.408
I'm sure the victims must
have contributed to the panic.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.145
The jury may not love it,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.885
but they'll believe it.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.957
I'll get on it.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.857
He didn't get
a seat at the gala.
He didn't?
No!

13:17.890 --> 13:18.720
Courtney?

13:18.760 --> 13:20.352
Can you get Kalinda
for me, please?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.594
Sure.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.860
And Mr. Gold phoned.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.299
Oh, I'll call
him back later.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.036
What's going on?

13:27.070 --> 13:29.197
Oh, nothing.
It's the gala.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.207
The bar fund-raiser.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.605
The partners bought
five tables.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.176
Everyone wants
to see who's invited.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.905
And Ziegler wasn't.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.498
Ziegler from
tax litigation?

13:36.540 --> 13:37.871
Why not?

13:37.910 --> 13:38.945
Well... you know,

13:38.980 --> 13:40.971
probably means
he's being laid off.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.442
Ah.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.447
Um...

13:43.490 --> 13:44.946
Oh, don't worry,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.480
none of the second-year
associates were invited.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.987
Oh, good.
I hate that stuff.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.009
Oh, you're here.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.186
Hey.
Good.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.549
Problems?

13:51.590 --> 13:54.354
Yes, he wants me to
carry a parasol now.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.389
Anything new?

13:55.430 --> 13:59.025
Yeah.
This just went up.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.928
What do you think of him?

14:02.970 --> 14:05.029
Blake?

14:05.070 --> 14:06.367
I don't know.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.638
Why?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.978
Just asking.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.238
(techno music plays)

14:11.280 --> 14:12.941
It's the same
cell phone camera.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.119
How do you know?

14:15.150 --> 14:16.549
Oh, same voice.
Mm-hmm.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.047
Best evidence rule.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.409
Judge should admit
the whole video.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.111
This is part
of the video.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.252
There's stuff in there

14:22.290 --> 14:23.484
that might help you
blame the victims.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.485
Thanks.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.055
Oh, um, Kalinda...

14:27.100 --> 14:29.056
look, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.124
All right.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.666
Blake keeps calling
you Leela.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.931
He seems to want to make
some kind of point with it.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.540
Okay.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.345
She's splitting the male vote,
that's what she's doing.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.516
She could win.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.586
She's the only
female candidate.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.349
Damn right she could.
We could've buried that bitch.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.926
You think you could say that
a little louder?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.518
I don't think
those kids heard you.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.629
We got to scare her off.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.993
Up until the moment she
announces, it's revocable.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.533
Okay.

15:07.570 --> 15:08.969
Do it.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.400
The gloves come off?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.101
Are you saying that she
leaked Alicia's deposition?

15:13.140 --> 15:14.437
Yes.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.072
The transcripts went
through her office.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.247
Take the gloves off.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.044
Thank you, sir.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.585
(people screaming, clamoring)

15:29.720 --> 15:32.223
Your Honor, I don't know
what the defense counsel

15:32.260 --> 15:34.228
expects this to prove,
but there is no evidence

15:34.260 --> 15:36.967
that this video is part of the
already submitted exhibit.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.060
The evidence is _that the same
person is recording the Video.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.034
I don't think that's
concluswe, counselor.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.367
But it is persuasive,
Your Honor.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.105
_ It has_the same
images in common,

15:45.140 --> 15:46.038
it has the same voice.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.379
(gasps)
"After the Fall?"

15:48.410 --> 15:49.399
Hmm?

15:50.410 --> 15:52.298
Yeah. Yes, it is.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.443
I played Maggie in high school.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.072
QUINN:
No...

15:56.120 --> 15:58.008
My goodness,
that was a tough part.

15:58.050 --> 15:59.210
Um, Nancy.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.717
QUINN:
That's my daughter.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.079
Yale Drama.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.985
Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.457
"I been killed
by a lot of people,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.127
"some couldn't
hardly spell,

16:09.160 --> 16:12.061
but it is the same, mister."

16:12.100 --> 16:13.067
(chuckling)

16:13.100 --> 16:14.089
At my high school,
we had

16:14.140 --> 16:15.129
to take out
all the dirty words.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.104
(both chuckling)

16:17.140 --> 16:18.630
Your Honor...

16:18.670 --> 16:21.776
could I have a ruling?

16:21.810 --> 16:23.141
You know, it's funny.

16:23.180 --> 16:27.071
My daughter wanted
to play Maggie,

16:27.120 --> 16:30.089
but I think she was
a much better Holga.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.782
So, is it an act?

16:36.820 --> 16:39.027
Is what an act?

16:39.060 --> 16:40.698
Why don't you take
the next witness?

16:40.730 --> 16:42.129
Sure.

16:42.160 --> 16:42.797
You've worked as a medic

16:42.830 --> 16:44.320
at the arena for how long?

16:44.370 --> 16:45.496
Four years.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.169
I've been at
two dozen raves,

16:48.200 --> 16:50.339
but I've never seen one

16:50.370 --> 16:51.439
as crowded as that.

16:51.470 --> 16:52.801
That was bad, wasn't it?

16:52.840 --> 16:54.171
It's our turn now.

16:54.210 --> 16:55.575
No further questions,
Your Honor.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.272
I don't know much
about this rave business.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.813
It's like a concert, right?

17:00.850 --> 17:02.078
Yes.
Except with
loud music?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.087
It's kind of like

17:03.120 --> 17:04.815
trance-like
mu5ic?

17:04.850 --> 17:06.181
Yes.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.154
It sounds kind
of repetitive to me.

17:08.190 --> 17:11.819
But what do I know?
I like the Beatles.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.521
Objection.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.596
Sustained.

17:15.630 --> 17:19.191
Sorry. I will withdraw
my musical opinions.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.630
So I'm wondering if you can
help me out with something.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.664
What is that...

17:25.710 --> 17:28.099
there, on that
woman's necklace?

17:28.140 --> 17:31.143
Oh. It's a pacifier.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.115
Like a baby's pacifier?

17:34.150 --> 17:36.141
(laughs)

17:36.180 --> 17:38.444
Why would someone wear
a pacifier to a concert?

17:38.490 --> 17:39.616
Ecstasy tends

17:39.650 --> 17:42.289
to make people
grind their teeth,

17:42.320 --> 17:44.629
and the pacifier is
intended to stop that.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.218
You're kidding.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.727
I'm always amazed

17:47.760 --> 17:49.455
by the things
I don't know in the world.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.524
DEERFIELD:
Objection.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.162
Overruled.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.737
Now, that's one of
the victims there,

17:54.770 --> 17:57.159
wearing a pacifier?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.006
It is.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.803
So one could conclude
that that person

17:59.840 --> 18:02.638
had taken
the drug ecstasy?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.602
Yes, but ecstasy
tends to calm people.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.606
It doesn't make
them stampede.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.617
It calms them?

18:07.650 --> 18:09.641
Like this?

18:09.680 --> 18:12.649
(partiers shouting on tape)

18:14.490 --> 18:17.880
I have no way to
diagnose that.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.228
Now, in your first aid kit,

18:20.260 --> 18:24.299
at the arena, you have over 50
packs of something called--

18:26.430 --> 18:27.738
Ben...

18:27.770 --> 18:28.794
Benzodiazepines?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.398
Yeah... (laughs)

18:30.440 --> 18:32.567
Um, why so much of that?

18:32.610 --> 18:34.737
It's helpful in
treating PCP.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.169
PCP. That's another drug.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.145
Is that one also calming?

18:40.180 --> 18:41.579
No.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.918
NANCY: No, in fact,
it's the opposite.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.510
It makes kids violent.

18:46.550 --> 18:48.154
Is that right?

18:48.190 --> 18:49.748
Yes.

18:49.790 --> 18:53.191
Now, sometimes,
these ecstasy pills

18:53.230 --> 18:55.289
are laced with PCP.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.922
Yes.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.758
Oh, my goodness.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.837
I can see how
this could happen.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.861
(partiers screaming)

19:08.880 --> 19:11.201
No further questions.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.187
Good job.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.858
Why, thank you.

19:20.890 --> 19:22.881
(car alarm honks)

19:24.890 --> 19:27.620
FEMALE DEEJAY:
...a|so expect a delay
of 30 to 40 minutes

19:27.660 --> 19:29.696
on the Eisenhower Expressway.

19:29.730 --> 19:32.722
So let's sit back and enjoy
Jane Jensen's "Luv Song."

19:33.970 --> 19:36.598
(Jensen laughs over song intro)

19:36.640 --> 19:43.375
* Hey, here's a love song

19:43.410 --> 19:46.777
* For your boyfriend

19:48.550 --> 19:52.281
(car alarm honking)
* A love song

19:52.320 --> 19:55.551
* For your new boyfriend

19:58.830 --> 20:01.993
* He's gotta be cool
like James Dean *

20:02.030 --> 20:04.464
* And burn like fire

20:04.500 --> 20:06.923
* He's sweet like sugar

20:06.970 --> 20:10.758
* Or like custard and desire

20:10.810 --> 20:13.938
* Never backs away
from a good fight *

20:13.980 --> 20:16.801
* Oh, yeah, never gets sleepy

20:16.840 --> 20:19.547
* He goes down all night

20:19.580 --> 20:23.949
* Love song

20:23.990 --> 20:25.810
* For your boyfriend

20:29.990 --> 20:32.550
* Whoo

20:32.590 --> 20:36.799
* Ah... ah...

20:36.830 --> 20:38.320
What are you waiting for?

20:38.370 --> 20:40.668
Go report it.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.932
* Ah, here's a love song

20:46.010 --> 20:47.329
* For your boyfriend

20:47.380 --> 20:48.972
* What did you say?

20:50.850 --> 20:55.275
* A love song

20:55.320 --> 20:56.844
* For your new boyfriend

20:56.880 --> 20:59.713
* That's right

20:59.750 --> 21:04.289
* A love song

21:04.330 --> 21:06.628
* For your new boyfriend

21:06.660 --> 21:08.196
* That's right.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.697
It's just petty
harassment.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.798
You two and
Alicia will say

21:14.840 --> 21:15.590
you didn't leak
Childs' deposition,

21:15.640 --> 21:18.666
What can they do,
hold their breath?

21:18.710 --> 21:19.699
It's costing us time.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.674
But it's not costing us clients.

21:21.710 --> 21:22.870
They like when we

21:22.910 --> 21:24.673
get in the face of
the State's Attorney.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.075
Um, are you plus one?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.372
Am I...?

21:27.420 --> 21:28.409
For the gala.

21:28.450 --> 21:29.678
Are you bringing a date?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.540
I'm arranging
the partners' table.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.854
Oh, yeah.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.585
What is it again?

21:35.620 --> 21:39.989
The Cook County Bar Association
Fund-raiser Gala.

21:40.030 --> 21:43.363
Right-- CCBAFG.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.924
How could I miss it?

21:44.970 --> 21:45.994
Plus one.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.019
Good.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.833
Someone over 25 this time?

21:48.870 --> 21:50.633
Sure, if she doesn't
have homework.

21:50.670 --> 21:51.762
Derrick? How 'bout you?

21:51.810 --> 21:54.301
Plus one?

21:55.740 --> 21:58.743
No, just myself.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.338
Oh.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.383
Well, that leaves...
two seats at our table.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.342
Which one of the equity partners
do you want to drag up?

22:06.390 --> 22:07.755
How about the Florricks?

22:11.790 --> 22:13.724
Did I say something?

22:13.760 --> 22:15.819
No, it's just,
Alicia's a second year.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.464
_I don't think _
we're inVIting assoaates.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.923
Yes, but it would
look good to clients

22:19.970 --> 22:21.562
to have her husband
at our table.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.103
Yeah. How about it, Will?

22:24.140 --> 22:27.064
There's room right here,
next to your plus one.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.675
DERRICK:
Look, if I'm stepping
on any toes, just...

22:30.710 --> 22:31.870
No toes. Sure, great.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.639
The Florricks. Go for it.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.587
This is funny,
isn't it?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.689
All these
connections.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.049
My old workplace,

22:47.090 --> 22:49.650
my old boss, my old coworker...

22:49.700 --> 22:53.659
and my new boss competing
with your husband.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.895
And then there's you two and...

22:55.940 --> 22:57.669
your thing.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.665
Chicago.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.734
Shall we start?

22:59.770 --> 23:00.771
Yeah.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.699
So, Mrs. Florrick...

23:06.750 --> 23:09.412
did you leak the deposition
you conducted with Mr. Childs?

23:09.450 --> 23:10.417
No.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.587
Good.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.110
So we're done here.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.856
(Cary and Will chuckle)

23:15.920 --> 23:17.683
Did you tell your husband

23:17.730 --> 23:18.822
about Mr. Childs'
deposition?

23:18.860 --> 23:19.827
No.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.896
And is it fair to say

23:21.930 --> 23:23.659
that you never leaked

23:23.700 --> 23:25.190
confidential information
to your husband?

23:25.230 --> 23:26.299
It is.

23:26.330 --> 23:29.834
Good, because that would be
a disbarrable offense.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.977
And is it also fair
to say that you never

23:34.010 --> 23:37.070
discuss conﬁdential trial
information with your husband?

23:37.110 --> 23:38.475
It is.

23:41.950 --> 23:44.487
Good.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.059
(Will snoring)

23:57.670 --> 24:00.025
There it is.

24:00.070 --> 24:03.836
So, last year, September 2009,
when you first started here

24:03.870 --> 24:06.168
at Lockhart, Gardner,
was your first case

24:06.210 --> 24:09.532
a pro bono murder trial
involving a supposed carjacking?

24:09.580 --> 24:10.877
Yes.

24:10.910 --> 24:12.548
And in this trial,
you presented

24:12.580 --> 24:14.844
evidence that
the Chicago PD pitted--

24:14.880 --> 24:16.871
or buried-- evidence,
is that right?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.239
Yes.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.815
Where'd you get
this information?

24:25.630 --> 24:27.086
Objection, Cary.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.098
What does this have to do
with the leaked deposition?

24:29.130 --> 24:30.768
Well... (slurps)

24:30.800 --> 24:33.564
Mrs. Florrick has claimed
that she and her husband

24:33.600 --> 24:35.659
never discuss con_fidential
trial information.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.565
That wasn't
a confidential trial.
Perfect.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.759
Then she shouldn't mind
answering.

24:41.140 --> 24:44.075
I'm going to request
a recess on this.

24:44.110 --> 24:46.044
I want to review the law
on this situation.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.775
Yeah, sure.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.617
The law-- that's what
you want to reVIew.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.784
WILL:
Okay.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.151
Talk to me.

25:00.260 --> 25:01.921
I...

25:03.930 --> 25:05.727
We have attorney-client
Privilege, Alicia.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.567
Talk to me.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.933
Peter told me
there was pitted evidence.

25:13.110 --> 25:16.671
ButI pursued it myself; I found
the pitted evidence myself.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.803
But you only pursued it
because Peter pointed you there.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.942
Okay.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.719
Did you solicit
this information?

25:28.760 --> 25:29.715
No.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.886
Then it's a passive breach.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.227
He broke confidentiality;
you didn't.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.818
Yes, but he was only
trying to help me.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.157
I see that,
but that doesn't matter.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.952
He broke confidentiality.

25:37.000 --> 25:37.659
Will...

25:37.700 --> 25:39.895
This is a fishing expedition.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.591
Of course it is.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.961
But at least you know
you're not the target; Peter is.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.706
I can't hurt him.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.800
He was trying
to help me.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.206
Alicia, listen to me.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.649
You're a lavwer.

25:53.680 --> 25:57.047
Under oath, you have
to tell the truth.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.880
This isn't just about you.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.956
This is about the firm, too.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.929
Okay, what?

26:18.970 --> 26:21.200
There's gonna be
a third candidate.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.299
VVho?

26:25.310 --> 26:28.017
First off, lay off Alicia.

26:28.050 --> 26:31.816
Okay, Peter, you know
your mistake--

26:31.850 --> 26:33.818
never show your opponent
your weak flank.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.954
Well, we both have weak flanks;

26:36.990 --> 26:39.356
and the person
that leaked your depo

26:39.390 --> 26:40.994
was trying
to weaken us both.

26:41.030 --> 26:42.657
Your mysterious third candidate?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.190
Presiding Judge Adler.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.369
That might prove
a bit difficult.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.836
Not after she retires.

26:51.870 --> 26:54.134
Now, when I was in office,

26:54.180 --> 26:57.001
I investigated her
for judicial bribes.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.940
So use it, Peter.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.277
Why do you need me?

27:00.310 --> 27:02.972
Well, my guess is
that you have more.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.951
Thanks for answering
a few more questions, Mr. Dylan.

27:10.990 --> 27:13.857
I'm sorry to have
to ask you this,

27:13.900 --> 27:16.824
but did you drop ecstasy
the night of the stampede?

27:17.870 --> 27:19.326
Yes.

27:19.370 --> 27:22.999
And your fiance Juliette,
did she?

27:24.270 --> 27:26.033
I'm sorry,

27:26.070 --> 27:27.970
but I have to ask.
No...

27:28.010 --> 27:29.102
you don't.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.870
You don't have to ask anything.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.070
You're trying to blame me.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.077
No, I'm trying...

27:34.120 --> 27:35.940
I saw her die.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.414
I saw...

27:38.450 --> 27:41.089
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me,

27:41.120 --> 27:44.681
and I saw
her crushed.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.869
Any more questions?

27:56.740 --> 27:58.731
Thank you.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.349
Just one from me,
Your Honor.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.041
Oh, go on.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.775
I'm sorry, Paul...

28:08.820 --> 28:10.071
if my co-counsel's efforts

28:10.120 --> 28:14.989
to protect Mr. Berlin
have hurt you in any way.

28:17.020 --> 28:18.123
Don't ever do that.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.923
Oh, you were
turning off the jury.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.757
You don't undercut
your co-counsel!

28:21.800 --> 28:22.755
You didn't see them.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.199
You know what this is.

28:24.230 --> 28:26.198
You know we're going to lose,
and you want my client

28:26.230 --> 28:27.731
to take the brunt
of the award.

28:27.770 --> 28:28.737
That's silly.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.362
Do not pick a battle
with me, lady;

28:30.400 --> 28:32.061
not in the mood I'm in.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.131
Well, let's
see who wins.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.149
You have _
my credit card receipt?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.158
I need it to, uh,
return the rental car.

28:59.130 --> 29:03.089
So... how do I escalate this?

29:03.140 --> 29:05.062
Any way you want, scout.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.338
I'm game.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.305
I looked into your background,
uh, Kalinda.

29:09.340 --> 29:12.138
The, uh, Menlo Park childhood,
the nice suburban home,

29:12.180 --> 29:13.147
the migr parents.

29:13.180 --> 29:15.819
It doesn't exist.

29:18.350 --> 29:21.217
And you seem to have a past
history with Will Gardner.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.029
We've both been busy.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.482
.357,huh?

29:26.530 --> 29:29.055
It's... it's kind of
a big and sloppy gun.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.261
You-You butchering deer or...

29:31.300 --> 29:33.120
compensating for something?

29:36.200 --> 29:37.804
You want to find out?

29:40.310 --> 29:42.471
What, is that too close?

29:44.550 --> 29:46.404
How about this?

29:46.450 --> 29:49.248
Or this?

29:52.550 --> 29:55.053
It's a little ham-fisted,
don't you think?

29:55.090 --> 29:56.114
Using sex?

29:56.160 --> 29:59.049
I don't know.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.079
Let me feel.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.067
Yeah, you're right.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.137
Feels very ham-fisted.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.301
Take care.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.859
Yeah, it was
horrible.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.266
Next day, the walls were
crushed, had to be re-drwNalled.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.097
Which doorway was it?

30:41.140 --> 30:42.289
The one that opened?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.967
Over there.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.035
But this wasn't like
this, though, right?

30:46.070 --> 30:47.401
The stage? No.
The stage slides.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.273
They wanted more room,
so they slid it over.

30:50.310 --> 30:53.279
That's where it happened.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.413
Weird, huh?

30:54.450 --> 30:56.111
Five kids died right here.

30:56.150 --> 30:57.515
KALIN DA:
What's that?

30:57.550 --> 31:00.883
The skids.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.021
Holds the stage in place.

31:04.060 --> 31:06.483
This looks new.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.327
Was it recently
replaced?

31:08.360 --> 31:11.966
Yeah. It didn't have
a cover that night.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.966
This could be the reason
why people tripped.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.171
Who moved the stage?

31:21.210 --> 31:22.234
Oh, I don't know.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.100
I didn't work that night.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.447
I'd talk to Rich, but
he doesn't work here anymore.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.448
They did a sweep
about a month ago.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.515
Sweep?

31:28.550 --> 31:29.517
Immigration?

31:29.550 --> 31:30.915
Yeah.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.278
Do you have his number?

31:40.290 --> 31:43.919
So I imagine you had
a chance to review the law.

31:43.970 --> 31:44.925
WILL:
I did.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.028
Good.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.397
So shall we just pick up
right where we left off?

31:49.440 --> 31:51.067
It's your rodeo.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.635
All right.

31:53.670 --> 31:57.629
We, uh, were discussing your
first case here, Mrs. Florrick.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.545
A murder case.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.604
And I asked you--

32:00.650 --> 32:02.379
let's see-- quote:

32:02.420 --> 32:06.982
"You presented evidence that
the Chicago PD had pitted--

32:07.020 --> 32:08.317
"or buried-- evidence,

32:08.360 --> 32:09.509
is that right?"

32:09.560 --> 32:10.515
And you said,

32:10.560 --> 32:12.380
"Yes. ll

32:16.500 --> 32:21.062
And I asked, "Where did you
get this information?"

32:21.100 --> 32:24.308
So... can you answer that?

32:24.340 --> 32:25.329
I can.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.008
Please do so now.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.304
I got the information
from the original discovery.

32:29.340 --> 32:35.176
I found a page missing
in the defense's Xerox.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.472
You do know you're under oath?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.340
I do.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.641
Before you discovered

32:40.690 --> 32:43.352
the missing page
in the discovery,

32:43.390 --> 32:47.053
did anyone else tell you
about the pitted evidence?

32:52.100 --> 32:53.260
No.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.291
I think I'll object to that.
Object to what?

32:55.340 --> 32:56.398
This line of questioning.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.762
This line of questioning is
on point, Mr. Gardner.

32:59.810 --> 33:02.301
It goes to
confirm or rebut

33:02.340 --> 33:04.308
Mrs. Florrick's assertion
that she and her husband

33:04.350 --> 33:05.772
never discussed confidential
trial information.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.641
No. But nice try.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.568
Then let's
call the judge.
Good. Let's call him.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.611
Well, he'll side with me.
He probably will.
He'll also allow me

33:11.650 --> 33:13.186
to haul Mr. Childs
in for questioning.

33:13.220 --> 33:17.589
Mr. _C_hilds welcomes a full
airing on this matter.
My guess is he won't welcome

33:17.620 --> 33:20.282
a full airing on a matter I
have first-hand knowledge of,

33:20.330 --> 33:22.491
and intend to question him
about, under oath.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.231
(camera beeps off)

33:34.380 --> 33:36.200
And what matter is that?

33:36.240 --> 33:37.776
Something that'll hurt him

33:37.810 --> 33:40.142
a hell of a lot more than
this'll hurt Peter.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.741
I wish when people threatened,
they actually used words.

33:45.390 --> 33:48.314
I'll guarantee you this, Cary:

33:48.360 --> 33:50.715
When you go back to your boss

33:50.760 --> 33:54.150
and report
what we just discussed,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.555
he'll be relieved
we didn't use words.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.799
(Cary sighs)

34:21.490 --> 34:23.151
Thank you.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.384
Hey...

34:24.430 --> 34:26.125
Will, I...

34:26.160 --> 34:30.119
I just hated how he was
doing that... that's all.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.498
We're invited _
to the gala tomorrow night.

34:36.540 --> 34:39.259
Would you like me
not to go?

34:39.310 --> 34:43.269
No. It'll be fun. Go.

34:43.310 --> 34:45.403
(door closes)

34:45.450 --> 34:48.772
(Eli and Diane conversing
indistinctly)

34:53.620 --> 34:56.282
I need you to talk
to someone for me.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.685
VVho?

34:57.720 --> 34:59.119
Victoria Adler.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.196
The presiding judge?

35:01.230 --> 35:03.357
I was made to understand
you were friends.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.493
Well... we were.

35:05.530 --> 35:08.135
Oh. Not anymore?

35:08.170 --> 35:10.661
She asked me to run
for a judgeship.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.702
Then she asked me not to.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.435
We believe that
she's gomg to use

35:17.480 --> 35:19.869
her keynote speech tomorrow
night to announce her candidacy.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.878
For what?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.876
State's Attorney.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.459
So excuse the irony, but we
need you to ask her not to run.

35:30.590 --> 35:33.229
(laughs)

35:33.260 --> 35:36.297
Thank you,
Cook County Bar Association

35:36.330 --> 35:37.695
for this acknowledgment.

35:37.730 --> 35:40.722
And thank you for that
overwhelming introduction.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.533
Vicky.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.265
Do you have a minute?

35:45.440 --> 35:46.634
What's that?

35:46.670 --> 35:48.877
The reasons not to run.

35:48.910 --> 35:52.175
Who put you up to this?

35:52.210 --> 35:54.576
Does it matter?
It does to me.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.542
You and I want a women
candidate, Viclq.

35:56.580 --> 35:57.717
But you're not it.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.617
Let's find someone
in four years.

36:00.650 --> 36:03.380
So this is dirt? On me?

36:03.420 --> 36:05.479
You run,
you'll set us back ten years.

36:05.530 --> 36:09.421
They'll say it's because it's
a woman, and not because...

36:09.460 --> 36:10.688
I'm corrupt?

36:12.900 --> 36:14.834
(wry laugh)

36:14.870 --> 36:17.338
So, how does this work?

36:17.370 --> 36:20.237
I promise not to run
and this stuff goes away?
Probably something like that.

36:20.270 --> 36:21.669
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

36:23.010 --> 36:25.649
We've had our
difficulties, but...

36:25.680 --> 36:27.477
I am not enjoying this.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.910
(chuckles)

36:29.950 --> 36:32.487
Okay...

36:32.520 --> 36:35.216
I promise not to run.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.291
What's up?
I found him.

36:42.330 --> 36:46.528
I know that's supposed to
mean something to me...

36:46.570 --> 36:47.889
Sorry. Rich Salazar.

36:47.930 --> 36:50.364
He was with the arena.
Maintenance.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.903
He helped move the stage
to the center of the arena,

36:52.940 --> 36:54.669
exposing these.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.598
Security was supposed to have
covered them with plywood,

36:56.640 --> 36:58.847
but they thought nobody would
come through that door.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.575
And that's what
tripped people?

37:00.610 --> 37:03.613
Yeah. Afterwards,
client security covered them,

37:03.650 --> 37:06.016
before the cops got there.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.779
Security covered them?

37:09.520 --> 37:10.680
He will.
(sighs)

37:10.720 --> 37:13.450
Oh...
What?

37:13.490 --> 37:15.549
The joint defense agreement.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.624
I've got to get
Crozier to approve

37:16.660 --> 37:18.924
before putting
him on the stand.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.495
And she won't approve,
because it'll make her
client look gUIlty.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.839
Wait a minute-- you don't
need Crozier's approval;

37:24.870 --> 37:26.861
you need your
co-counsel's approval.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.300
Yeah, but...

37:30.340 --> 37:34.049
Mr. Baylon,
how are you doing?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.310
(grunts)

37:36.350 --> 37:39.342
This is Kalinda Sharma;
she's here to witness

37:39.390 --> 37:41.756
your approval of my
adding a new witness.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.958
Rich Salazar.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.697
He was a custodian at the arena.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.698
Do you approve, sir?

37:50.730 --> 37:54.359
(muttering)

37:55.840 --> 37:57.569
Thank you.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.363
Thank you, Mr. Baylon.

37:59.410 --> 38:02.675
And have a...
a good recovery.

38:02.710 --> 38:05.770
ALICIA:
Mr. Rich Salazar.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.573
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

38:07.610 --> 38:08.872
I was not informed
of this witness.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.615
Who is he?

38:10.650 --> 38:12.311
He was with arena
maintenance

38:12.350 --> 38:14.079
and will testify to certain
acts by the security team.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.417
What's going on?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.052
(whispers):
New strategy.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.819
I'm sorry, Your Honor; we have
a joint defense agreement.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.749
We both need to approve
of this witness.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.597
And I didn't.

38:23.630 --> 38:25.598
I... I don't.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.428
No, my joint defense
agreement is with Mr. Baylon.

38:28.470 --> 38:29.789
And he consented
in your stead.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.559
Here's the affidavit.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.768
_ This all looks _
in order, Miss Cr02ier.

38:39.810 --> 38:40.777
Anything else?

38:40.810 --> 38:42.675
No, not at the moment.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.018
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.799
Praise the struggling worker.

38:54.830 --> 38:57.628
The sounds of their trucks.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.720
Woosh... woosh... woosh.

39:00.770 --> 39:04.638
Ahoogha. The horn.

39:04.670 --> 39:07.366
God bless the horn.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.935
Sizzzzzz.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.868
Praise the sound of the foundry.

39:11.910 --> 39:14.003
Kah-choom, kah-choom.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.779
Why're you so nervous?

39:15.820 --> 39:17.412
I'm not nervous.

39:17.450 --> 39:20.112
Want me to discuss De_rrek Lee's
free agency again?

39:20.150 --> 39:22.550
You know how that turns me on.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.683
(Poetess continues indistinctly)

39:24.730 --> 39:26.686
TAM MY:
Who's that?

39:26.730 --> 39:29.392
WILL: One of those two guys
is going to be

39:29.430 --> 39:30.727
the next state's attorney.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.024
Really? They seem like friends.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.038
Yep. Politics.

39:35.070 --> 39:36.867
I hate politics.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.960
I love that about you.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.877
I... hate... politics.

39:42.910 --> 39:43.877
(chuckling)

39:43.910 --> 39:47.141
Politics. Hate.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.774
(Poetess continues
indistinctly)

39:54.460 --> 39:57.111
POETESS: Praise the child
digging in the sand,

39:57.160 --> 39:59.082
singing her song:

39:59.130 --> 40:03.692
"I am a little teapot
short and stout,

40:03.730 --> 40:06.767
here is my handle
and here is my spout."

40:06.800 --> 40:09.769
In her words,
she sings the song...

40:09.800 --> 40:12.735
Well, we're really up front,
aren't we?

40:12.770 --> 40:14.169
WILL:
Table three.

40:14.210 --> 40:15.939
You look good.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.507
You, too. Grownup clothes.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.542
Oop, sorry.
This is Tamara.

40:22.580 --> 40:23.808
Ta... Tammy.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.181
Hi. Alicia.

40:26.890 --> 40:29.017
I need some wine.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.459
Did you get the verdict?

40:30.490 --> 40:32.685
We did.
And?

40:32.730 --> 40:34.083
Three million dollars.

40:34.130 --> 40:35.757
Ouch.
We pay two,

40:35.800 --> 40:37.620
the co-defendant pays the rest.

40:37.660 --> 40:38.820
Two million?
No.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.189
Two dollars.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.561
You're kidding.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.862
The price of the filing.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.767
(giggles)

40:45.810 --> 40:47.664
Lawyers. I don't get lavwers.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.769
They seem to always
want to trick people.

40:49.810 --> 40:52.472
Tamara's a reporter.
The Sporting News.

40:52.510 --> 40:55.877
We sit and wait for a bus.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.741
Hush-hush. Here it comes.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.554
Here it comes.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.649
(applause)

41:07.630 --> 41:09.257
Thank you, Nana.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.768
And welcome.
What a year it's been.
There you are.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.189
I was wondering what
happened to you.
Late verdict.

41:14.230 --> 41:15.629
Good verdict?
Yes.

41:15.670 --> 41:17.934
Let's celebrate.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.234
DIANE: ...women's causes
for decades.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.976
She is without a doubt
my mentor.

41:22.010 --> 41:24.069
Victoria.

41:24.110 --> 41:26.840
(applause)

41:26.880 --> 41:29.041
You're happy.
Yep.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.981
Kept a third candidate
out of the race.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.214
Thank you,
Cook County Bar Association

41:33.250 --> 41:34.956
for this acknowledgement,

41:34.990 --> 41:39.950
and thank you, Diane, for that
overwhelming introduction.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.821
I know you share this sentiment:

41:41.860 --> 41:44.863
that women have
far too long found themselves

41:44.900 --> 41:48.688
the afterthought
in Chicago jurisprudence.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.061
Always we hear
the same thing: four more years,

41:51.100 --> 41:52.909
four more years.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.238
But it is not the four more
years of re-election;

41:55.280 --> 41:57.771
it is the four more years of
"Just wait..."

41:57.810 --> 41:58.879
Oh, no...

41:58.910 --> 42:02.038
"Then it will be your turn."

42:02.080 --> 42:04.981
And so, tonight,
I am pleased to announce

42:05.020 --> 42:08.808
a new candidate in the race
for state's attorney.

42:08.860 --> 42:12.853
I mean no disrespect to the two
other current candidates--

42:12.890 --> 42:14.994
both here and both capable--

42:15.030 --> 42:20.889
but every now and then, you need
a woman to clean house.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.906
And that woman is...
Wendy Scott-Carr.

42:25.940 --> 42:29.899
(applause)

42:29.940 --> 42:32.738
Time to clean house.

42:38.050 --> 42:41.110
She was in the deposition.
Sheleakedit

42:43.690 --> 42:45.351
WENDY:
Thank you so much.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.881
My mother and my grandmother
were housecleaners,

42:47.930 --> 42:49.898
so I guess I can continue
the tradition.

42:49.930 --> 42:52.069
Who's Wendy Scott-Carr?
