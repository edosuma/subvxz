Girls, as you know,

01:51.278 --> 01:55.657
in my youth, I was a honeybee.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.619
Now, I'm not the kind of person

01:55.699 --> 01:58.619
who likes to brag

01:58.660 --> 02:02.706
but my hive voted me queen bee

01:58.660 --> 02:02.706
and retired my antennas.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.209
Sounds like bragging to me.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.796
Okay, all you honeybees

02:08.837 --> 02:10.714
it's time right now

02:08.837 --> 02:10.714
to welcome into the hive

02:10.756 --> 02:11.924
a new honey of a bee.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.592
Let's hear it for

02:11.966 --> 02:13.592
Michelle Tanner.

Please save all your

02:18.722 --> 02:21.100
Okay, it is time

02:18.722 --> 02:21.100
right now

02:21.141 --> 02:23.184
for me to present

02:21.141 --> 02:23.184
to you, Michelle.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.354
The official honeybee sash.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.856
You know, honey,

02:26.396 --> 02:27.856
I-I can't believe

02:27.898 --> 02:30.233
you're my last little baby bee.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.986
You know, I've put

02:30.275 --> 02:31.986
three bees through the hive.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.570
I don't mean to drone on

02:33.612 --> 02:35.530
but who better to drone with

02:33.612 --> 02:35.530
than a bunch of bees, huh?

02:40.661 --> 02:43.413
Daddy, my sash.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.582
Oh, right, sorry.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.167
Excuse your antennae.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.167
There you go.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.714
How come I don't have

02:50.004 --> 02:52.714
any badges?

02:52.756 --> 02:55.300
Because you have to earn

02:52.756 --> 02:55.300
them by doing projects.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.013
You know, I had so many badges,

02:55.342 --> 02:59.013
I had to wear two sashes.

02:59.054 --> 03:02.390
In fact, I earned a badge

02:59.054 --> 03:02.390
for earning the most badges.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.368
Oh, huh, I get it.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.495
You want your name first.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.495
You're such a baby.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.122
- Ranger Joe.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.122
- Uh, Jess, Jess.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.289
Forget about the music.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.084
- You're still fired.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.084
- What?

03:29.126 --> 03:31.586
There's been some big budget

03:29.126 --> 03:31.586
cuts down at the station

03:31.628 --> 03:32.963
and they decided you're out.

03:33.005 --> 03:36.424
I almost said to 'em,

03:33.005 --> 03:36.424
"Hey, if he goes, I go."

03:36.466 --> 03:38.177
But I really like it there.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.889
You're really firing me?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.889
I'm fired?

03:41.930 --> 03:44.307
Why? Fire him.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.307
Get rid of the woodchuck.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.434
Look, I'll do the dumb jokes,

03:44.349 --> 03:46.434
I'll wear the stupid outfit.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.229
I'll do anything

03:46.476 --> 03:49.229
but sit on your hand.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.898
Jess, look, I don't know

03:49.270 --> 03:50.898
how to break it to you

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
but, uh, we don't pay

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
him a salary.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.651
He's a puppet.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.196
What am I doing?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.656
I'm begging to be

03:57.237 --> 03:59.656
on a kiddie show.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.575
I'm jealous of

03:59.698 --> 04:01.575
a buck tooth beaver.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.162
Nah, this-this wasn't my dream,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.162
to be on a kiddie show. I..

04:05.204 --> 04:06.830
You know what?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.830
This is a sign.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.707
I'm gonna put all my energy

04:06.872 --> 04:08.707
right back into my music.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.044
You know what? I just heard of

04:08.749 --> 04:12.044
this new label, Fat Fish Music.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.253
I'm gonna put a great

04:12.086 --> 04:13.253
demo together

04:13.294 --> 04:14.337
and get it to them right away.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.422
You know what, Joseph? Thanks.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.548
You actually did me a favor.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.674
Yeah, my pleasure.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.926
If I'd known

04:17.716 --> 04:18.926
you'd be so happy

04:18.967 --> 04:20.594
I would have fired

04:18.967 --> 04:20.594
you weeks ago.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.769
Oh, Comet.<i> Perro Muy bien.</i>

04:28.810 --> 04:32.313
Boy, Deej, you sure are going

04:28.810 --> 04:32.313
to a lot of<i> mucho</i> trouble.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.650
Well, I have to get my dad

04:33.899 --> 04:35.650
in the mood.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.986
I can't just say,

04:35.692 --> 04:37.986
dad, I'm going to Spain.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.573
He worries when I say,

04:38.028 --> 04:41.573
dad, I'm going to the mailbox.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.576
My parents were really excited

04:41.615 --> 04:44.576
when I told them about Spain.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.494
They already bought me

04:44.618 --> 04:46.494
a one-way ticket.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.793
Okay, everybody,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.793
you can come down now.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.380
<i>Hola, me familia.</i>

04:57.422 --> 04:59.591
She said, "hello, my family."

05:00.842 --> 05:02.636
Whoa-ho,<i> que pasa.</i>

05:02.677 --> 05:06.140
He said, "Whoa-ho,

05:02.677 --> 05:06.140
what's happenin'?"

05:06.181 --> 05:08.267
[speaking in Spanish]

05:11.728 --> 05:13.147
She either said,

05:11.728 --> 05:13.147
"dinner's ready"

05:13.188 --> 05:15.065
or "it's time to

05:13.188 --> 05:15.065
clip your nose hairs."

05:18.110 --> 05:20.862
Okay, Deej, what do you want,

05:18.110 --> 05:20.862
how much is it gonna cost me

05:20.904 --> 05:22.447
and why is the dog

05:20.904 --> 05:22.447
wearing a hat?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.368
Well, there's this summer-study

05:25.575 --> 05:27.368
program in Barcelona.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.745
No.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.871
I'll get to live with

05:28.787 --> 05:29.871
a Spanish family.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.498
No.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.374
I'll get to study the language

05:31.539 --> 05:33.374
and expand my horizons.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.210
- No.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.210
- Doesn't that sound exciting?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.087
No.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.338
So you're not saying that I'm

05:37.129 --> 05:39.338
not allowed to not go, right?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.135
What did you just say?

05:43.177 --> 05:46.305
I don't know, I just wanted

05:43.177 --> 05:46.305
to get you off that no thing.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.307
Uh, Danny, come on.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.307
At least think about it.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.851
I mean this is D.J.'s chance

05:48.347 --> 05:50.851
to learn about a new culture.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.936
Yeah, come on, Danny,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.936
remember that one summer

05:52.978 --> 05:55.438
when we took that

05:52.978 --> 05:55.438
trip together?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.941
Joey, we rode our

05:55.480 --> 05:57.941
bikes to Oakland.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.570
Dad, when D.J.'s in Spain,

05:59.609 --> 06:02.570
can I have her room?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.281
Oh, that's very caring.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.532
Deej, this is a big decision.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.242
I need some time to think

06:05.573 --> 06:07.242
about it, honey.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.829
Dad, please, this is a once

06:07.284 --> 06:10.829
in a lifetime opportunity.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.332
Don't worry, Mr. T,

06:10.871 --> 06:13.332
I'll be with her every minute

06:13.372 --> 06:17.169
as we sample the art,

06:13.372 --> 06:17.169
the music, the tango.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.963
[tango music]

06:22.465 --> 06:24.968
Come on, Mr. T,

06:22.465 --> 06:24.968
we wanna see the world.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.721
Alright, Kimmy, let's start

06:25.010 --> 06:27.721
with the back door.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.848
<i>Adios.</i>

06:30.891 --> 06:32.059
<i>Ole.</i>

06:33.894 --> 06:35.520
Look, why don't we just

06:33.894 --> 06:35.520
sit down for dinner.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.022
I'm serving paella.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.316
<i>- Oh, muy bueno.</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.316
<i>- 'Oh, muy bueno. Gracias.'</i>

06:39.358 --> 06:41.860
Who's ready for dessert?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.320
Michelle's trying to

06:41.902 --> 06:43.320
earn her first

06:43.362 --> 06:44.779
honeybee badge for cooking.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.741
You gotta taste it.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.369
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt

06:47.782 --> 06:50.369
to have dessert as an appetizer.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.830
I call it Michelle's

06:50.409 --> 06:53.830
pudding surprise.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.749
Oh, sounds delicious.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.251
What's the surprise?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.505
I think it's cheese.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.841
Surprise.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.595
Michelle, you put

07:06.093 --> 07:08.595
cheese in the pudding?

07:08.636 --> 07:11.431
Velveeta and that's not all.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.017
Hmm, olives.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.022
Don't you like it?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.690
No, it's-it's very

07:19.064 --> 07:20.690
different, honey.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.983
- Good.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.983
- Mm-hmm.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.485
Then how come

07:22.025 --> 07:24.485
nobody's swallowing?

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
- Hey, everybody.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
- Hey.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.913
- Hi, honey.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.913
- Oh, fiesta. Cool.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.581
How did it go with

07:34.955 --> 07:36.581
the record company?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.417
Yeah, so far, so good, I mean

07:36.623 --> 07:38.417
at least they heard of me.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
They're gonna listen

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
to my tape and get back to me.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.378
Let me tell you guys something.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.546
I have a feeling something

07:41.420 --> 07:43.546
good's gonna happen.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.714
Whoa.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.592
But that's not it.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.387
That was awful.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.805
Michelle cooked it.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.766
I was trying to get

07:51.846 --> 07:54.766
my honeybee badge.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.685
Oh, I didn't say awful.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.104
No, no, no, I said awfully good.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.897
Boy, that's awf..

07:59.146 --> 08:00.897
You know what?

08:00.939 --> 08:02.065
In fact, I'm gonna

08:00.939 --> 08:02.065
have some more.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.068
Here we go, see there?

08:02.107 --> 08:05.068
Hmm-mm.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.280
Velveeta?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.908
And, uh, olives, is it?

08:13.410 --> 08:14.786
You could stop eating.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.039
I know you don't like it.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.249
Ah, you know, Michelle,

08:18.081 --> 08:19.249
you know what?

08:19.291 --> 08:20.959
We'll give it to, uh..

08:21.001 --> 08:22.210
We'll give it to Comet.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.254
Hey, Comet will like it,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.254
he likes anything.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.588
Here you go, Comet.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.724
I guess it needed more olives.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.438
Are you laughing?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.648
- Look at that. What's that?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.648
- Feel that.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.650
- See that bunny's tail?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.650
- See that?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.735
What's that?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.735
Oh, can you feel that?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.446
It's soft, huh?

08:49.488 --> 08:52.532
It's soft like your big jelly

08:49.488 --> 08:52.532
belly. Give me that thing.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.787
Uh-uh. The hair, the hair.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.787
Let go of the hair.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.998
I know you're jealous.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.626
Hey, give me that,

09:00.040 --> 09:03.626
give me, give me, give me that.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.254
Becky, what color

09:03.668 --> 09:06.254
is that hair?

09:06.296 --> 09:07.839
It's, uh, gray.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.218
What?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.970
Well, it's a l-light shade

09:11.259 --> 09:13.970
of black

09:14.012 --> 09:15.972
resembling the color gray.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.933
I have gray hair?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.601
Well, just a couple of 'em.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.229
What?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.981
Here, here, here you go.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.981
Stay right there.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.107
How can I have gray hair?

09:26.149 --> 09:29.403
I'm only 29,

09:26.149 --> 09:29.403
I can't have gray hair..

09:29.444 --> 09:31.530
Yank 'em. Yank 'em.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.530
Yank 'em.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.448
Okay, but they say for every

09:31.571 --> 09:33.448
gray hair you pluck

09:33.490 --> 09:34.574
two more grow in its place.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.867
Drop that hair.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.619
Jess, would you relax?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.580
So you have a couple

09:38.661 --> 09:40.580
of gray hairs.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.541
At least you still

09:40.621 --> 09:42.541
have your hair.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.918
Yeah, but for how long?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.918
I feel it receding. I'm..

09:44.959 --> 09:46.753
You know what,

09:44.959 --> 09:46.753
I'm feeling it in my sleep.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.714
I-I know how to check for this.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.714
I know how to check.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.266
Oh, my God. It's moved

09:56.471 --> 09:59.266
four millimeters north.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
Beck, I'm gonna have one

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
of those foreheads

10:02.185 --> 10:03.853
that starts at my eyebrows

10:02.185 --> 10:03.853
and go all the way

10:03.895 --> 10:05.063
to the back of my neck.

10:05.813 --> 10:06.856
[telephone rings]

10:06.898 --> 10:08.483
There, see? The word's out.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.984
It's probably

10:08.525 --> 10:09.984
the hair club for men.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.365
Talk to me.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.365
Oh, sure I'll hold.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.243
It's David Janolari

10:15.407 --> 10:18.243
from Fat Fish Music.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.620
Yes, Mr. Janolari, hello.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.330
Oh. Aha.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.041
Oh.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.210
Thanks for crushing

10:25.083 --> 10:27.210
my dreams so fast.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.088
Alright. That's okay, bye.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.136
He said they like my music

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
they like the sound,

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
they like the look.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.848
They just don't hear

10:38.721 --> 10:40.848
a hit single.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.601
Jess, look, I know

10:40.890 --> 10:42.601
it's disappointing

10:42.642 --> 10:44.227
but you can't let it

10:42.642 --> 10:44.227
get you down.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.187
You know what?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.187
I have an idea.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.356
How about tomorrow, you and me,

10:46.229 --> 10:48.356
the boys spend the day together?

10:48.398 --> 10:49.690
Come to the studio, okay?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.109
The Beach Boys are

10:49.732 --> 10:51.109
gonna be on the show.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.319
Come on. They're your friends.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.362
Like I wanna be around

10:52.360 --> 10:54.362
The Beach Boys.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.072
They had hit records

10:54.404 --> 10:56.072
when they were 18.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.325
I'm almost 30,

10:56.114 --> 10:58.325
I got nothing.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.118
Jess, life is not a contest.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.370
Honey, things happen

11:00.160 --> 11:02.370
when they're supposed to.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.372
I don't know.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.372
Well, time's runnin' out.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.665
So is my hair.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.377
This is so frustrating.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.087
I mean, what happens if

11:09.419 --> 11:11.087
I never make it

11:11.129 --> 11:12.380
in the music business?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.264
Dad, come on.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.264
The suspense is killing me.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.475
Can I go to Spain

11:21.306 --> 11:23.475
with Kimmy or not?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.018
I know when you're

11:23.517 --> 11:25.018
tryin' to make a decision

11:25.059 --> 11:26.936
that could change

11:25.059 --> 11:26.936
the entire course of my life

11:26.978 --> 11:28.647
the last thing

11:26.978 --> 11:28.647
you wanna be is pushed.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.857
So you won't catch me

11:28.687 --> 11:30.857
pushing you.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.900
No, siree.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.900
No pushin' here.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.570
- Deej.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.570
- I know, I'm pushing.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.113
I'm backing off.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.697
Sweetheart, I told you,

11:37.155 --> 11:38.697
I just, I gotta think

11:38.739 --> 11:40.158
about this a little more, okay?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.621
Deej, have you seen

11:42.536 --> 11:44.621
your Uncle Jesse?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.414
- He's upstairs.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.414
- Oh, great.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.791
Jess, come on down!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.502
(Jesse)

11:48.833 --> 11:50.502
'I'm kinda busy.'

11:50.544 --> 11:51.710
Jess, this is really important.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.630
Come on down now.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.383
Deej, your uncle Jesse

11:53.672 --> 11:56.383
is gonna flip.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.176
Mike and Bruce from

11:56.424 --> 11:58.176
The Beach Boys are here.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.844
[screams]

11:59.886 --> 12:01.929
I promised them some good

11:59.886 --> 12:01.929
old-fashioned home cooking.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.722
Quick, call chicken on wheels.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.519
Come on in, you guys.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.563
- Hi.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.563
- Oh, hi.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.737
Hey, when do we eat?

12:18.779 --> 12:21.199
Thirty minutes or less.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.034
Ha, she's a kidder.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.952
Jess!

12:24.994 --> 12:27.205
What Becky?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.205
What's so important?

12:31.042 --> 12:33.169
Whoa-a, The Beach Boys.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.339
Whoa-a, Miss Clairol.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.383
- Hi. Dr. Love, how you doing?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.383
- How you doing?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.634
- Bruce.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.634
- How you doing, man?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.721
It's the beach boys

12:39.676 --> 12:42.721
and I got my..

12:42.761 --> 12:44.639
Well, thanks for the warning.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.725
Well, how did I know you'd

12:44.681 --> 12:46.725
be dyeing your hair.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.560
Why are you dyeing your hair?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.396
'Cause I'm worth it.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.899
Well, honey,

12:53.607 --> 12:54.899
Mike and Bruce came over

12:54.941 --> 12:56.025
because they heard you had

12:54.941 --> 12:56.025
a new studio

12:56.067 --> 12:57.318
and-and they'd like to jam.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.405
- Cool.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.405
- And eat Becky's<i> home</i> cooking.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.906
Becky can cook?

13:01.948 --> 13:04.701
I mean, boy, hey,

13:01.948 --> 13:04.701
when she cooks, look out.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.121
Hey, that's cool you guys

13:06.578 --> 13:08.121
wanna play, that's great.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.623
I'll call the guys,

13:08.162 --> 13:09.623
they'll be over in ten minutes.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.998
You know, it'd be good too

13:09.664 --> 13:10.998
because It'll give me time

13:11.040 --> 13:13.752
to comb out

13:11.040 --> 13:13.752
and rinse, otherwise..

a little tip, now, alright.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.971
You like pudding,

18:15.428 --> 18:16.971
you like cheese

18:17.013 --> 18:18.681
so you put them together.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.018
You like ice cream and tuna,

18:18.723 --> 18:22.018
again, you put them together.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.519
Stop putting things together.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.021
You gotta lose the combo deal.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.398
Just try one thing.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.053
Okay, look, I've been

18:54.050 --> 18:57.053
thinking about Spain.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.055
You gotta understand,

18:57.095 --> 18:59.055
this is a big decision.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.140
It's a decision that I've been

18:59.097 --> 19:01.140
wrestling with all day.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.976
And if you know anything about

19:01.181 --> 19:02.976
wrestling, which I do

19:03.017 --> 19:05.979
because I was dorm champ

19:03.017 --> 19:05.979
in the 145-pound class

19:06.020 --> 19:07.855
You know, I was really

19:06.020 --> 19:07.855
wiry back then too.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.565

19:14.904 --> 19:17.406
How would you know?

19:14.904 --> 19:17.406
He never gets to the news.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.533
Kimmy, don't be rude.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.533
He might change his mind.

We don't know what

19:19.575 --> 19:20.952
he's gonna say.

Maybe we want him to

19:20.994 --> 19:22.495
change his mind.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.871
Maybe he hasn't

19:22.536 --> 19:23.871
made up his mind.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.624
Maybe you want me

19:23.913 --> 19:26.624

20:55.629 --> 20:56.964

21:04.055 --> 21:05.932
