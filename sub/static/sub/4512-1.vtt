Sixteen-fifty for you, 16.50 for me.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.836
Loretta, I'm leaving.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.337
What do you mean?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.504
Soon as I get my check, I'm gone.

00:45.812 --> 00:46.904
I'll be back.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.447
-Dwight, I need my check.
-Payday's at the end of the month.

00:50.617 --> 00:54.246
Haven't paid us for last month.
I need money, Loretta's got a kid--

00:54.421 --> 00:57.618
Problem with management?
Put a note in the suggestion box.

00:58.024 --> 01:01.482
-I'm serious. I'm quitting.
-I'll be back for the dinner shift.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.461
I sure as hell won't be.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.260
What are you doing?

01:10.437 --> 01:12.871
I'm taking what he owes me,
not a penny more.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.530
You take that money,
he's gonna come after you.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.469
-Gotta find me first.
-What you gonna do?

01:19.446 --> 01:22.279
This ought to cover that bike
for little Keith.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.212
You're late to pick him up.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.610
Go. I got everything covered here.

01:26.786 --> 01:27.980
You're really going?

01:28.154 --> 01:29.712
I'm really going.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.125
That bike can wait till Christmas.

01:34.294 --> 01:37.559
You keep what he owes you.
I'll deal with Dwight, okay?

01:40.333 --> 01:41.732
See you later.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.428
How much to Los Angeles?

03:18.598 --> 03:21.123
-One-way or round-trip?
-You're kidding, right?

06:07.633 --> 06:11.000
Hey, Coco. Coco Puff, you're on.
Come on. You're on, you're on.

06:53.446 --> 06:54.811
We may not have windows...

06:55.248 --> 06:58.615
...but we do have the best view
on Sunset Strip.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.677
Twenty bucks.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.952
What is this place, a strip club?

07:04.123 --> 07:05.147
"Strip club"?

07:05.792 --> 07:08.386
I should wash your mouth out
with Jägermeister.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.992
The only Pole you'll find in there
is Natasha, the shot girl.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.068
Babycakes, I got a club to fill here.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.567
Right, sorry.

07:32.852 --> 07:33.876
Enjoy.

Everything you dream of

08:04.183 --> 08:05.946
But never can possess

08:07.553 --> 08:10.021
Nothing's what it seems

08:10.957 --> 08:13.517
Welcome to Burlesque

08:16.095 --> 08:18.928
Everyone is buying

08:19.098 --> 08:21.999
Put your money in my hand

08:23.469 --> 08:25.960
If you got a little extra

08:26.138 --> 08:28.265
Well, give it to the band

08:35.780 --> 08:37.772
You may not be guilty

08:39.385 --> 08:41.318
But you're ready to confess

08:42.855 --> 08:45.085
Tell me what you need

08:46.392 --> 08:49.589
Welcome to Burlesque

08:50.062 --> 08:52.656
You can dream of Coco

08:53.432 --> 08:55.832
Do it at your risk

08:56.802 --> 08:58.929
The triplets grant you mercy

09:00.306 --> 09:02.467
But not your every wish

09:03.976 --> 09:06.945
Jesse keeps you guessing

09:07.513 --> 09:10.277
So cool and statuesque

09:10.950 --> 09:13.851
"Behave yourself, " says Georgia

If you want a little extra

09:33.472 --> 09:35.497
Well, you know where I am

09:35.841 --> 09:38.105
Something very dark

09:39.278 --> 09:41.940
Is playing with your mind

09:43.149 --> 09:45.049
It's not the end of days

Welcome to Burlesque

10:25.558 --> 10:28.026
-Can I get you a drink?
-Only if you're buying.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.856
-Welcome to L.A.
-Thank you.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.554
-Where you from?
-lowa.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.628
-Kentucky. We're practically related.
-Thought you looked familiar.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.409
Hey, sweetheart?
You wanna do your job? Let's go.

10:52.785 --> 10:56.619
Who does a girl have to flirt with
to get from here to up there?

10:56.789 --> 10:58.347
Is this you flirting?

10:58.758 --> 11:02.250
With someone wearing more eyeliner
than me? Yeah.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.089
Through that door over there.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.753
Ask for Tess.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.263
-She's your guy. Flirt away.
-Thanks.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.765
-lowa.
-Yeah?

11:09.935 --> 11:11.129
Use my name.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.533
Thanks, Jack.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.569
Hold it! Hold it. That's good.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.304
We're on in five minutes,
Five minutes, ladies,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.472
-Get over there.
-All right, I'm coming.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.311
Ladies! Let's move it, ladies!

11:26.485 --> 11:28.453
Does anyone know where Nikki is?

11:29.221 --> 11:31.815
Both spotlights are
supposed to pull in.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.389
Georgia, your boyfriend is so cute.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.461
So tonight, takeout and a movie?

11:37.630 --> 11:38.654
Both.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.560
-Casablanca and Oreos.
-Yes.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.564
Tess! I lost a contact on the stage.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.830
Okay, if you fall off the stage,
leg extended, boobs up.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.906
Remember, you're a goddess.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.804
-Thank you, Sean.
-You're welcome.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.671
"Thank you, Sean."

11:52.845 --> 11:54.210
Come here, give me.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.904
-Wait.
-What? The foot?

11:56.082 --> 11:58.312
Yeah, the foot, the back, the neck.

11:58.484 --> 12:01.248
The hips, the breasts, the face....

12:01.987 --> 12:04.649
Vince, the sink's busted
upstairs again.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.951
I'm not calling a plumber, Coco.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.827
Tess, have you read this letter
from the bank?

12:10.996 --> 12:14.454
How many times have I told you?
No business during business hours.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.625
-Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight.
-So what?

12:17.803 --> 12:19.532
This isn't going away.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.765
You won't talk to me before the show,
after the show.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.500
It's like you're avoiding me.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.202
I didn't divorce you
to spend more time with you.

12:27.379 --> 12:31.110
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore,
but I still own half this place.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.784
"Mr. Tess."

12:33.319 --> 12:34.616
That is so hot.

12:34.787 --> 12:37.585
Nice, but it won't pay the bills.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.681
Wait. Wait. Zip me up.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.457
Excuse me, I'm looking for Tess.

12:46.532 --> 12:47.863
Hi, are you Tess?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.631
And you are in my mirror because?

12:51.170 --> 12:54.333
Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack,
and I'm looking for a job.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.373
And where have you danced?

12:56.542 --> 12:59.033
At home, mostly. But I can move.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.771
Okay, give your name
and number to Sean.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.245
Let you know
when we're having our audition.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.050
When will that be, exactly?

13:06.485 --> 13:07.577
Sean?

13:07.753 --> 13:11.052
-Where the hell is Nikki?
-I don't know. She's late again.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.088
Oh, I'm never late. Ever.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.283
That's great.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.691
We're trying to put on a show here.
Come back another time.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.831
I've never seen anything like this.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.594
-I need a job. I wanna work here.
-Great enthusiasm, terrible timing.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.432
So leave your name and your number
with Jack, your friend downstairs.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.835
And we'll call you. Okay? Promise.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.568
Hey, can you fix this for me?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.373
Let's move it, ladies!

13:37.183 --> 13:39.708
-Hello.
-Oh, my God. Nikki.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.947
You're probably not
gonna believe this...

13:43.122 --> 13:45.556
...but Sean and I were talking,
and he said....

13:45.724 --> 13:50.184
I said, "It's so sad that Nikki couldn't
join us for the opening number...

13:50.362 --> 13:53.729
...but it would be so great
if she joined us for the next one."

13:54.166 --> 13:57.431
Paws and claws.
Took longer than I thought.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.764
So is finding a new job
when I fire you.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.065
Yeah, right.

14:01.473 --> 14:02.599
-Get ready.
-Yeah.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.910
Hey. Bring me a martini.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.068
Extra dry, straight up, three olives.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.612
-And hurry back.
-She doesn't work here.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.044
Then she's not busy.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.780
Twenty minutes and we're back.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.424
Your mama tell you
it's not polite to stare?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.090
You're just so damn beautiful, l--

14:22.494 --> 14:25.930
Well, in that case, screw your mama
and stare away.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.998
No one would ever know.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.258
Know what?

14:29.435 --> 14:30.493
That you're a dude.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.262
-God.
-Can I use this?

14:35.074 --> 14:37.770
Goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!

14:38.577 --> 14:39.976
Hey, waitress!

14:40.412 --> 14:42.039
Sweetheart? Hey, over here.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.238
One second.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.716
Yo!

14:54.159 --> 14:55.854
-Ladies?
-I'll have a vodka.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.852
What can I get you?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.295
One shot of Patrón...

15:03.469 --> 15:07.132
...and tough guy with the hat
over there, he wants a Cosmo.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.534
-What are you doing?
-One night.

15:09.708 --> 15:13.166
If I'm not better than boobs-for-brains,
you don't have to pay me.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.143
Isn't that the girl
that was backstage?

15:47.112 --> 15:48.136
I think so.

15:48.314 --> 15:51.181
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?

15:51.850 --> 15:53.317
She really wanted a job.

15:53.485 --> 15:56.613
And so she is our new waitress.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.519
And when did I make you
head of personnel?

15:59.725 --> 16:02.387
She just picked up a tray,
started working.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.026
-Really?
-Well, her name is Ali.

16:05.597 --> 16:06.723
Ali.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.532
Hey, Ali.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.867
Look, this is cute, but come on.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.871
Push up those boobs.
Got them, show them. Work them.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.968
And don't ever
go behind my back again.

16:20.946 --> 16:24.347
-Yes, ma'am.
-And don't ever call me ma'am again.

16:24.516 --> 16:27.451
-Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess.
-Get on the floor.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.117
"Ma'am"?

16:32.291 --> 16:33.781
What am l, my mother?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.119
Yes, ma'am.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.522
Up yours.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.773
Excuse me.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.147
Dewar's rocks and a bottle
of your best champagne.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.686
Oh, and will you tell Nikki
that I'm here?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.016
And you are...?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.384
A member since '91.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.991
Marcus Gerber. And you are?

17:10.162 --> 17:12.528
-Ali.
-Ali.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.961
I'm here.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.163
You're late, you're late
for a very important date.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.634
Georgia went on for you.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.743
What is that waitress doing here?
I want that bitch out now.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.437
What did she ever do to you?

17:30.616 --> 17:34.052
-She told me I look like a drag queen.
-Can't be the first time.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.247
Get my spot.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.949
Nikki, what are you doing?

19:00.572 --> 19:01.630
Hey!

19:04.042 --> 19:06.169
Ali. Ali.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.410
Ali. Ali. What do you need?

19:09.581 --> 19:11.242
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom--

19:11.416 --> 19:12.644
And keep it coming.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.843
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?

19:15.053 --> 19:17.351
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.319
Dating Nikki. This week at least.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.290
I wanna be up there.
I wanna do that.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.094
Question is...

19:30.269 --> 19:32.032
-...do you have the talent?
-I do.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.501
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.764
-Positive?
-Yeah.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.635
Good, because you're on.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.740
I got a dentist

20:11.743 --> 20:15.736
Who's over seven feet tall

20:19.117 --> 20:21.915
Ooh, I've got a dentist, baby

20:24.556 --> 20:28.253
The man is over seven feet tall

20:30.662 --> 20:35.156
His name is Dr, Long John

20:38.170 --> 20:40.365
And he answers

20:41.673 --> 20:43.402
Every call

20:54.086 --> 20:55.246
It's simple.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.615
I assume all
your financial obligations...

20:57.956 --> 20:59.253
...buy you out...

20:59.424 --> 21:01.722
...pay you a million
right off the top.

21:01.893 --> 21:02.985
Five hundred each.

21:04.062 --> 21:08.556
Where is the partnership that--? You
said there was gonna be a partnership.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.263
How about a partnership?

21:10.936 --> 21:14.030
Partnerships don't really
work so well with me.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.970
-And that deal is--
-Very generous.

21:17.142 --> 21:20.134
Good. Because I lead
with my final offer.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.180
Not that I give a shit, but why is it
that you want my club so badly?

21:24.349 --> 21:26.010
I like it.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.548
I see something I like,
I have to have it. Since I was a kid.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.588
That must have made you
very popular in the sandbox.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.253
I did okay.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.328
You know what you could
do with that?

21:38.497 --> 21:40.761
You know what you could
do with that money?

21:40.932 --> 21:42.490
-Not now.
-Don't "not now" me.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.225
The way I see it...

21:45.103 --> 21:48.072
...you're in a fix
and I'm in a position to help.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.676
We play this thing right,
and we all come out winners.

21:51.843 --> 21:52.867
Yeah.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.809
You got that balloon payment
due on the first.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.472
Did you also tell him
I have a tattoo on my ass?

21:58.850 --> 22:01.011
No. It's business.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.020
I don't think you're gonna get
another opportunity like this.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.590
So take it.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.468
-No.
-She means not now.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.872
No, no.
"Not now" means not now, Vince.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.444
No means no.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.780
Marcus, I don't care
what you're offering.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.815
My club is not for sale.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.184
Well, offer's on the table.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.314
Thanks.

22:45.263 --> 22:46.992
See you in the sandbox.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.092
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?

23:25.504 --> 23:26.528
Drinks, ladies.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.869
All right, white wine.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.202
Tom Collins.

23:32.844 --> 23:34.277
Which one is Nikki's?

23:34.446 --> 23:36.209
-Both.
-Shit.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.577
That was my shot.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.553
Here's mud in your eye, Nik.

23:48.693 --> 23:52.959
All right. Now I got a buzz,
and you gotta change. You're on.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.261
What are you, my mother?

23:57.202 --> 24:00.194
In case you haven't noticed,
Vince was talking to Marcus.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.239
Well, that's because Marcus
is trying to buy my club.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.003
Mother of God.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.071
Tess? Probably not a good time.

24:07.245 --> 24:10.214
I know you're busy
and I don't mean to interrupt.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.442
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about
the new vocals?

24:13.618 --> 24:15.677
That's what I've been
thinking about.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.419
-All the girls lip-synch--
-Except for Tess.

24:18.590 --> 24:19.818
Except for Tess.

24:19.991 --> 24:24.087
But wouldn't it be great if we
actually heard the girls sing?

24:24.262 --> 24:25.820
No. It wouldn't be great.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.021
Honey.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.599
People come here
to watch the dancers dance...

24:29.768 --> 24:33.761
...and to watch them lip-synch
to the great singers.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.099
I hear you. I get it.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.673
I'm just thinking
of ways to make it better.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.867
I don't understand why we can't try--

24:40.045 --> 24:42.912
You don't understand
because it's above your pay grade.

24:43.715 --> 24:47.082
I don't get what that means.
Hear me out. This is a good idea--

24:47.252 --> 24:49.516
Ali, Ali, no-- No. No. No.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.519
Stop. Take her and remove her.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.282
Okay, let's go. Come on.

24:53.458 --> 24:56.188
They need you on the floor,
but thanks for visiting.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.793
All right. Oh, this is not for anybody.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.632
You look so beautiful right now.
I can't even tell you.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.601
And you are so full of shit.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.286
Goddamn it!

25:43.108 --> 25:44.132
Ali?

25:49.681 --> 25:51.808
You can just have a seat.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.916
I'm gonna grab us
both a drink, yeah?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.916
Oh, and here.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.580
Call whoever you want.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.656
Long distance, whatever.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.490
-I can't.
-What do you mean?

26:06.898 --> 26:07.990
I don't have anyone.

26:09.167 --> 26:13.831
No parents or siblings,
aunts, uncles, anyone?

26:14.005 --> 26:15.029
No one.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.009
So you're not here to use my phone.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.208
No, no, stop.
It's gonna be all right.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.376
You can crash here.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.284
Just please, please, stop crying.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.918
Okay. Okay.

26:36.995 --> 26:38.622
I'll take that.

26:45.370 --> 26:46.394
Better?

26:46.571 --> 26:47.936
Good.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.037
Just one night.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.075
Till it's light out and I can
figure out my next move.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.236
Deal.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.454
That's beautiful.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.387
Who wrote that?

27:13.164 --> 27:14.290
I did.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.728
You wrote that?

27:15.900 --> 27:18.994
Jack, that's.... That's really good.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.070
Thank you.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.766
-You have more?
-Yeah.

27:25.944 --> 27:28.344
Nothing that's ready to be heard.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.778
Hey, Jack...

27:31.116 --> 27:32.708
...why did you leave Kentucky?

27:34.619 --> 27:35.813
Why did you leave lowa?

27:39.457 --> 27:42.255
Because I looked around
and realized...

27:43.294 --> 27:46.855
...there wasn't one person
whose life I wanted.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.056
Exactly.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.359
Hey, Jack.

27:53.905 --> 27:56.430
I'm really glad I don't have to
be alone tonight.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.134
Get some sleep.

28:11.489 --> 28:12.649
Morning.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.815
-Coffee?
-Black.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.952
Like my soul.

28:18.129 --> 28:20.689
I took the liberty
of making breakfast.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.698
I hope you don't mind.
It's the least I could do.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.096
Smells great.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.270
She's pretty. Your sister?

28:27.439 --> 28:29.373
-Fiancée.
-You're straight?

28:30.108 --> 28:31.973
-You thought I was gay?
-Yeah.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.907
-Wait, why?
-I don't know. The day bed, eyeliner.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.740
It's a very straight look.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.349
You know, it works at the club,
Tess loves it--

28:39.517 --> 28:40.779
Okay.

28:41.152 --> 28:42.585
I should put on some pants.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.016
Probably.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.180
So where is she, this fiancée?

28:46.357 --> 28:48.154
She's in New York doing a play.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.954
Now that you're straight
and engaged...

28:51.129 --> 28:54.030
...I feel really weird I came here
in the first place.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.129
I'm all right.

28:58.303 --> 29:01.636
-I'll be out of your hair in no time.
-You don't have to leave.

29:01.806 --> 29:04.331
-Don't worry about me.
-It's pouring outside.

29:04.642 --> 29:08.476
I got a plan.
If you could just get the door for me.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.373
Thank you.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.916
-You're welcome.
-See you at the club.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.344
Ali! What are you doing?

29:47.552 --> 29:48.917
Come back inside!

29:49.087 --> 29:50.748
No, Jack, I'm fine.

29:50.922 --> 29:52.150
It's pouring.

29:52.323 --> 29:54.655
It's just water, for chrissake.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.217
Damn it.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.562
Get your ass back in my house.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.698
You've done enough. I'm fine.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.966
All right, all right, fine. Here we go.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.104
Put me down. What are you doing?

30:07.272 --> 30:09.763
You have nowhere to go
and I have a couch.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.409
Like it or not, you're gonna stay.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.643
Hey, Natalie.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.544
Really? That's great.

30:38.803 --> 30:39.827
Georgia?

30:40.839 --> 30:41.965
Yeah.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.245
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.372
Oh, God.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.617
Please have the flu.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.816
Why do they call it
morning sickness...

31:00.992 --> 31:03.893
...if it hits you at every fricking
moment of the day?

31:04.062 --> 31:05.324
Have you told Damon yet?

31:05.797 --> 31:07.264
No, not yet.

31:07.832 --> 31:11.700
Well, sweetheart, you know,
at some point he's going to notice.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.030
He's a guy.

31:13.204 --> 31:16.662
He's not gonna notice
until my belly's blocking the TV.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.102
Well, what are you gonna do?

31:19.577 --> 31:22.410
I don't know, Tess.
I'm really scared.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.810
Oh, honey, don't be scared.

31:24.983 --> 31:29.044
Whatever you decide,
we will take care of you. Okay?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.915
But you've got to tell Damon.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.080
I figured as long
as he doesn't know...

31:33.458 --> 31:36.256
...I can still pretend he's gonna be
excited about it.

31:36.427 --> 31:39.954
He's gonna be thrilled.
Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.

31:56.114 --> 31:58.241
Excellent. That was great.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.543
Thank you very much, ladies.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.447
What happened to
all the great dancers in L.A.?

32:07.625 --> 32:09.422
They're dancing with the stars.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.824
Call Andre and ask.
He might have somebody.

32:11.996 --> 32:13.020
Okay.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.298
Don't like her, I don't like her.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.866
I don't love any of them.
She's the best one.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.401
What is that?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.770
What is she doing?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.469
I think she's auditioning.

32:31.582 --> 32:32.879
Hey, Dave, cut it!

32:36.054 --> 32:37.919
Hold on a second, I can do this.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.683
And I think it's sweet
that you think you can.

32:40.858 --> 32:44.555
-Tell me what you're looking for.
-Someone who can do the routine.

32:45.863 --> 32:48.798
Excuse me? I'm talking to you!

32:50.501 --> 32:51.525
Oh, shit.

32:52.003 --> 32:53.527
Just tell me what you want.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.303
I can't tell you.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.065
Nobody can tell you.

32:57.275 --> 33:00.142
You gotta make me believe
that you belong up there.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.803
That you own that stage and that
nobody's gonna take it from you.

33:04.349 --> 33:05.611
That's the way it works.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.581
You wanna show me something,
show me that.

33:09.587 --> 33:10.611
All right.

33:10.788 --> 33:13.382
Which number do you wanna see?
I know every one.

33:13.558 --> 33:16.118
-Every number?
-Which one do you wanna see?

33:18.129 --> 33:20.290
"Wagon Wheel Watusi."

33:34.612 --> 33:35.806
What's going on?

34:38.476 --> 34:40.909
Well, I couldn't keep
my eyes off her.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.944
Try harder.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.806
You were off the whole last half.

34:45.983 --> 34:50.351
Come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice
till I bleed. I know I can do this.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.489
You know, we have better dancers.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.955
Then say thank you very much
and goodbye.

34:55.126 --> 34:58.391
If you just give me a chance.
I swear I won't disappoint you.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.463
Didn't anybody ever
give you a shot?

35:00.631 --> 35:02.223
Please, I want this so bad.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.801
-lf you just give me a chance, l'd--
-All right. God!

35:06.003 --> 35:07.163
You got the job.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.772
What are you so excited about?
She's your replacement.

35:14.579 --> 35:17.070
Thank you, Tess.
You won't regret it.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.676
I am so gonna regret this.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.580
What is Ali short for?

35:26.757 --> 35:28.748
-Alice.
-Alice?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.553
Well, welcome to Wonderland.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.930
Meet me upstairs in five.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.762
Well, sorry for the short notice...

35:43.674 --> 35:44.732
...but I quit.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.104
It's okay.

35:47.278 --> 35:50.509
And with my new raise,
I will be off your couch in no time.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.117
Here we go.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.020
Black corset, first number.

36:02.193 --> 36:04.991
Second number, "Wagon Wheel,"
that's that.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.631
Swarovski bustier,
that's for the third number.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.699
And this is for "Miss Otis Regrets."

36:10.868 --> 36:13.268
And remember, with that, don't...

36:15.039 --> 36:16.631
...pull the trigger.

37:04.322 --> 37:07.553
You like her. I know it kills you,
but you have to admit it.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.694
No. You know, she pulls focus,
she doesn't blend in.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.590
A girl that doesn't blend in?

37:12.763 --> 37:14.025
Oh, my.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.132
That is so beneath you.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.828
Here we go, here we go.
Don't lose those again.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.198
How you doing?

37:21.372 --> 37:24.864
My boobs are pushed up to my ears,
my thong's a mile up my butt...

37:25.042 --> 37:28.534
...and my eyelashes are so thick
they could kick up a stiff wind.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.949
Fun being a girl, isn't it?
Come on, let's go, let's go.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.717
-You guys wanna go grab pizza?
-Yes, please.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.553
-Yeah.
-I'm starving.

37:40.725 --> 37:41.783
Good, let's go.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.426
My day was so long.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.923
Ice cream sounds so good.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.060
That's so bad.

37:50.468 --> 37:53.232
-I'm gonna get so full tonight.
-What?

38:23.668 --> 38:25.135
Where is everybody?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.498
They went out for pizza.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.833
I wasn't hungry.

38:35.212 --> 38:37.203
That brush isn't working.
It's too old.

38:37.381 --> 38:39.281
Well, it's the only brush I have.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.518
I'll let you use mine.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.052
-Here.
-Thanks.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.520
All right, here. Let me help you.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.331
Wet it if you're gonna get
a clean line.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.004
Close your eyes.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.039
When you are putting on
your makeup...

39:05.009 --> 39:06.738
...it's like you're an artist.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.277
But instead of painting
on a canvas...

39:10.047 --> 39:11.878
...you're painting your face.

39:14.819 --> 39:17.379
My mom was a model
and she was beautiful.

39:17.555 --> 39:18.954
Tall, blond.

39:19.557 --> 39:20.717
Not like me.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.761
Body that could stop a truck.

39:24.929 --> 39:29.764
And she had these girlfriends,
beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley...

39:29.934 --> 39:32.698
...and they would come over
in the morning...

39:32.870 --> 39:36.772
...and put their makeup on together
before they went on jobs. Up.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.933
We had a window in the back
of our house with a ledge...

39:40.111 --> 39:44.912
...and they would put their mirrors
side by side and put out their makeup.

39:45.082 --> 39:48.916
They had lipsticks and blushes,
and it was fabulous.

39:49.086 --> 39:53.853
I kept thinking, "God, I cannot wait
till I get old enough to play with this."

39:58.195 --> 40:01.187
Didn't you ever watch your mom
put on her makeup?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.232
My mom died when I was 7...

40:08.205 --> 40:10.002
...and it's my first lesson.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.982
You know,
you won't be the new girl forever.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.504
Beautiful.

40:51.081 --> 40:52.446
Shit.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.913
Ali.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.686
Ali. Did you use my towel again?

40:57.855 --> 40:59.823
I found it soaking wet on the floor.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.584
-I don't know. Maybe.
-How's that apartment hunt?

41:04.595 --> 41:07.758
I've been looking.
Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.

41:07.932 --> 41:10.924
How can you put a price
on privacy like that? Freedom?

41:11.101 --> 41:13.001
Your own bathroom? Clean towels?

41:13.170 --> 41:14.228
Okay, I get it.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.807
It's Natalie.

41:21.579 --> 41:22.603
Hey, babe.

41:26.517 --> 41:30.419
Oh, hey.
What about Beachwood Canyon?

41:30.988 --> 41:32.148
Great.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.619
If you have a car.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.992
I mean, truth is...

41:39.163 --> 41:41.654
...you really should get a car first.

41:42.032 --> 41:45.763
I mean, this is L.A. after all.
You know?

41:47.972 --> 41:49.234
I'll tell you what.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.674
I'm gonna suck it up...

41:51.842 --> 41:53.969
...and let you stay a little bit longer.

41:54.378 --> 41:56.437
Throw in something for rent,
we're good.

41:56.614 --> 41:59.947
-A second ago you wanted me out.
-I don't like my towel wet.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.745
I don't like the lack of privacy...

42:03.287 --> 42:04.481
...but you're in a jam.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.020
And I'm the kind of guy...

42:06.190 --> 42:09.091
...when a friend is in trouble, I help.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.420
It's just who I am.

42:10.961 --> 42:12.826
What did Natalie have to say?

42:12.997 --> 42:16.797
Nothing. No, she....
What did she say?

42:17.167 --> 42:18.429
"Hi." That was it.

42:18.602 --> 42:21.070
-And?
-And....

42:21.238 --> 42:23.172
Her play got extended
three months.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.604
She has to pay
everything there in rent...

42:25.776 --> 42:27.744
...so I have to cover
everything here.

42:27.912 --> 42:30.710
So if you wanna stick around
and chip in, it would--

42:30.881 --> 42:32.314
-Save your ass?
-Help.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.450
Well, will you look at that?

42:36.987 --> 42:39.114
The shoe on the other foot.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.121
One minute I'm a freeloader...

42:41.292 --> 42:42.884
...and the next...

42:43.060 --> 42:46.655
...I'm the only thing standing
between you and eviction.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.525
Just yes or no?

42:49.366 --> 42:51.630
What's the proposal exactly?

42:52.536 --> 42:55.471
Wonderful apartment.
Bathroom included.

42:55.639 --> 42:56.663
I'm listening.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.535
-Use of the kitchen.
-Keep going.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.677
-Six hundred a month.
-Closet?

43:00.844 --> 43:02.334
-Half.
-Oh, look.

43:03.347 --> 43:07.044
"Fabulous apartment
with a great view."

43:07.217 --> 43:08.616
Fine, fine.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.143
The whole closet.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.050
-I want the bedroom.
-No way.

43:12.222 --> 43:14.213
Oh, look. "Hot tub, Beverly Hills."

43:14.391 --> 43:16.450
All right. You can have my bedroom.

43:16.794 --> 43:17.954
Are you in?

43:18.228 --> 43:19.286
Oh, Jack.

43:19.463 --> 43:22.057
See, I'm the kind of girl...

43:22.232 --> 43:25.099
...if a friend's in trouble, I help.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.567
That's just who I am.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.974
Oh, boy.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.179
Your dream is killing me!

43:42.353 --> 43:44.048
It's killing me!

43:56.700 --> 43:58.361
What was that?

44:06.343 --> 44:07.469
And what's this?

44:07.711 --> 44:10.475
It's something about
the two mortgages.

44:12.149 --> 44:15.414
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't got a goddamn clue.

44:15.986 --> 44:18.216
But if I can't raise
the amount of money...

44:18.389 --> 44:21.517
...on that paper by the end
of this month, I lose the club.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.827
It's just money.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.189
It's just a number.

44:26.897 --> 44:28.296
I know...

44:29.199 --> 44:31.030
...but do you think I could do it?

44:33.704 --> 44:35.296
Okay, tell me a lie.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.497
I need your expert sewing skills.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.143
Tell me a new lie.

44:43.147 --> 44:44.842
I don't love you.

44:53.657 --> 44:56.182
Come here. Come here.

45:00.064 --> 45:01.395
It's okay.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.341
Stage right.

45:20.150 --> 45:22.380
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.
What's in that?

45:22.553 --> 45:23.577
Iced tea.

45:24.588 --> 45:26.453
Iced tea, my ass. Go home.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.625
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.

45:28.792 --> 45:30.555
You're not gonna go on. Go home.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.561
Relax. It is one drink.
What is the big deal?

45:33.731 --> 45:36.131
Ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.791
-She can't dance my part.
-She can and she will.

45:38.969 --> 45:41.870
No, no. My God, I can't do that.
It is Nikki's number.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.007
You said you can do
any number, right?

45:44.174 --> 45:46.506
-I don't wanna step on any toes.
-Then don't.

45:46.677 --> 45:48.076
I don't ca-- Listen to me.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.971
You're gonna go on,
and you're gonna go home.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.744
Here, put this on.

45:58.889 --> 46:00.254
Dave.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.619
Tess wants to see you.
Says it's urgent.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.283
I can't leave. I'm working.

46:04.461 --> 46:06.258
Don't say I didn't warn you.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.658
Shit.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.458
Everybody wants Dave
to do something.

46:10.634 --> 46:14.001
Y'all gonna have me singing
by the time I'm done here. Jesus.

46:48.272 --> 46:49.330
Tess, what's up?

46:49.506 --> 46:51.030
What are you doing back here?

46:51.241 --> 46:54.472
-Nikki said you were looking for me.
-Nikki? What is going on?

46:54.645 --> 46:56.112
Lower the curtain. Let's go.

47:00.951 --> 47:02.816
Bye. Thanks for coming.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.021
Hold it.

47:31.281 --> 47:32.646
Raise the curtain.

49:44.681 --> 49:46.114
Oh, my God.

49:49.186 --> 49:52.019
Am I the only one that has no idea
what just happened?

49:52.189 --> 49:53.451
Whatever it was--

49:53.623 --> 49:55.887
The music stopped,
I didn't know what to do.

49:56.059 --> 49:57.526
I had to sing, I'm sorry.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.853
Never told me
you could sing like that.

50:00.030 --> 50:01.258
I tried to tell you.

50:01.431 --> 50:02.728
Okay, okay, all right.

50:02.899 --> 50:05.766
This is what we're gonna do.
You know the songs, right?

50:05.936 --> 50:06.960
Oh, yeah.

50:07.137 --> 50:10.368
So tomorrow we're gonna rehearse,
then you're gonna sing.

50:10.707 --> 50:13.198
We're gonna go
straight through the show live.

50:13.377 --> 50:15.038
-So any questions?
-No.

50:15.212 --> 50:17.271
Okay, good. Good.
You go with the guys.

50:17.447 --> 50:20.177
Find out what keys
you're comfortable singing in...

50:20.350 --> 50:24.719
...and I'm going to go up to my office
and plan an entirely new show.

50:27.057 --> 50:28.922
-Okay?
-Oh, my God.

50:29.659 --> 50:30.751
Thanks, Tess.

50:30.961 --> 50:33.122
I'm gonna build a show around her.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.322
"They don't come to hear us sing"?

50:37.234 --> 50:39.498
They'll come to hear her sing.

50:45.609 --> 50:48.100
So how do you feel?

50:49.413 --> 50:52.405
-Amazing.
-I've never seen anything like that.

50:53.016 --> 50:56.144
Thanks. Are you sure Tess
really liked it? She wasn't...?

50:57.020 --> 50:58.715
I was bringing down the curtain.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.357
She stopped me.
She's the one who let you sing.

51:01.825 --> 51:04.726
-Really?
-She wants to build a show around you.

51:06.163 --> 51:08.063
You're crying with happiness, right?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.255
Good. Okay.

51:09.433 --> 51:10.957
Brava.

51:16.506 --> 51:19.907
Clearly one of us
has underestimated the other.

51:28.685 --> 51:31.586
I can't believe Tess has you
buried in the kick line.

51:31.755 --> 51:32.949
She didn't know I sang.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.920
Well, you certainly can.

51:35.292 --> 51:37.783
And you are way too good
to be doing it here.

51:38.261 --> 51:39.489
How about a drink?

51:39.663 --> 51:41.221
The bar's right over there.

51:41.398 --> 51:42.558
Tell Jack I sent you.

51:49.005 --> 51:50.802
Where the hell did that come from?

51:51.308 --> 51:53.799
-Who knew that you could do that?
-Thanks, Jack.

51:53.977 --> 51:56.377
Who knew any white chick
could sing like that?

51:56.546 --> 51:57.979
How do you do that?

51:58.148 --> 52:01.515
I don't know. It just happens.
I just do it.

52:01.685 --> 52:04.848
I know how that feels.
I gotta pee again, so....

52:05.755 --> 52:06.779
Stop.

52:07.257 --> 52:08.986
We're gonna get something to eat.

52:09.459 --> 52:10.483
You wanna come?

52:15.165 --> 52:16.325
Yeah, I would.

52:17.567 --> 52:18.829
Let's go.

52:19.402 --> 52:20.960
Look at you.

52:22.272 --> 52:23.432
What? What?

52:23.607 --> 52:26.667
Well, no, just the way
you're gazing after her.

52:26.843 --> 52:28.743
I have a fiancée, remember?

52:28.945 --> 52:31.743
Yes. No, I do. I know.
Three thousand miles away.

52:31.915 --> 52:32.939
We talk every day.

52:33.116 --> 52:34.708
You do? About what?

52:34.885 --> 52:36.477
Let me guess, don't tell me.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.416
About her.

52:40.123 --> 52:41.147
Her.

52:41.525 --> 52:43.288
And, I don't know....

52:43.660 --> 52:44.854
Her.

52:45.028 --> 52:47.519
All I'm saying is that
that one there...

52:47.697 --> 52:50.359
...is beautiful
on the inside as well...

52:50.534 --> 52:52.968
...and she's not going to be
available forever.

52:53.303 --> 52:56.272
Relationship advice from
Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.

52:56.439 --> 52:57.463
That is....

52:57.641 --> 52:58.665
Forgot my purse.

53:02.679 --> 53:04.010
-What?
-Oh, no.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.810
I was just telling Jack here
how every opportunity has a shelf life.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.444
Come here.

53:12.822 --> 53:14.050
Look there.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.585
Awfully pretty, but too much.

53:17.761 --> 53:20.855
See, I like that.

53:21.831 --> 53:24.231
No, I'm not cutting my hair.

53:24.401 --> 53:28.201
Who said anything about you
cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.

53:28.371 --> 53:30.236
I'm wearing one right now.

53:35.345 --> 53:37.370
Where have I been all my life?

53:38.181 --> 53:39.739
The dress is Chanel

53:39.916 --> 53:41.713
The shoes YSL

53:41.885 --> 53:43.614
The bag is Dior

53:43.787 --> 53:45.345
Agent Provocateur

53:45.689 --> 53:47.247
My address today

53:47.557 --> 53:49.354
L,A,, by the way

53:49.526 --> 53:51.016
Above Sunset Strip

53:51.361 --> 53:53.192
The Hills all the way

53:53.363 --> 53:54.921
My rings are by Webster

53:55.098 --> 53:56.690
It makes their heads twirl

53:57.167 --> 54:00.762
They all say, "Darling, what did you
Do for those pearls?"

54:00.937 --> 54:02.234
What?

54:03.873 --> 54:07.001
I am a good girl

56:02.559 --> 56:03.958
So good.

56:05.195 --> 56:07.026
Hey there, big boy.

56:08.932 --> 56:11.400
So, what do you think?

56:11.935 --> 56:13.368
I think you look....

56:13.536 --> 56:15.231
I mean, it looks....

56:15.939 --> 56:18.737
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.038
It's not like we're brother and sister.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.942
No, we certainly are not.

56:28.118 --> 56:30.678
I don't get why everyone's
having a conniption.

56:30.854 --> 56:33.880
She's just a tacky farm girl
from lowa.

56:35.558 --> 56:37.423
And we know a cow
when we see one.

56:40.630 --> 56:43.224
Don't underestimate us farm girls.

56:45.902 --> 56:47.164
Vince.

56:47.337 --> 56:48.770
This round's on me.

56:52.709 --> 56:54.267
I don't normally do this...

56:54.444 --> 56:57.277
...but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.

56:58.014 --> 56:59.982
It's either you or the auction house.

57:00.150 --> 57:01.981
No, I am not selling.

57:02.152 --> 57:04.484
Know what happens
when you default on a loan?

57:04.654 --> 57:05.712
No, hum a few bars.

57:05.889 --> 57:08.756
I'm not screwing around.
Where's the money coming from?

57:08.925 --> 57:11.655
Ali's a hit.
We can charge 50 bucks a head now.

57:11.828 --> 57:14.228
Raising the admission?
That's not good enough.

57:14.397 --> 57:17.264
You have been saying
that the sky is falling forever.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.334
Everything always works out fine.

57:19.502 --> 57:21.663
Tell that to the people
losing everything.

57:21.838 --> 57:23.601
I don't wanna be one of them.

57:23.773 --> 57:25.798
-I love this place too.
-No, you don't.

57:25.975 --> 57:27.169
-I do.
-No, you don't!

57:27.343 --> 57:29.243
-Yes, I do!
-Oh, no, you don't.

57:29.679 --> 57:33.080
Look, you have many
fine qualities, Vincent.

57:33.249 --> 57:35.308
And then you've got
some iffy qualities.

57:35.485 --> 57:37.112
But you've never been a phony.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.881
Just tell Marcus no.

57:55.705 --> 57:56.865
Jack?

57:59.576 --> 58:01.100
Yep. Just got in.

58:01.845 --> 58:03.745
I'm in here.
Can you come zip me up?

58:07.250 --> 58:08.740
Hey, where you been?

58:09.486 --> 58:10.612
Writing music.

58:10.954 --> 58:12.512
Can I hear?

58:14.023 --> 58:16.321
-It's not ready.
-It's not ready.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.017
Who's that?

58:18.728 --> 58:20.423
Me and my mom
on my 7th birthday.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.764
She died a few weeks later.

58:23.233 --> 58:24.632
You must miss her.

58:25.668 --> 58:29.934
Every single day something happens
that I wish I could tell her about.

58:31.274 --> 58:33.208
And what happened today?

58:38.014 --> 58:39.140
Nothing yet.

58:46.289 --> 58:48.917
You should get that.
It's probably Natalie.

58:49.092 --> 58:50.320
Probably.

58:54.264 --> 58:55.398
Hey, babe.

58:55.999 --> 58:57.193
Yes, I know.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.031
Check it out, girls!

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.769
I'm starved. You ready?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.647
I can't. I'm so sorry.
I have to do inventory tonight.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:28.977
Want me to call a cab?

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.848
No, that's okay.
I'll get a ride with Coco.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.511
Sorry.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.452
Watch your back. Coming through.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.650
You ready?

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:40.820
-For what?
-I'll drop you off.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.430
Coco left five minutes ago.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.828
I was coming to talk to you.
I caught your conversation.

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:51.268
-Talk to me about...?
-Dinner. With me. Give me that.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:55.709
If you ever expect to see
this bag alive again...

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.311
...you'll follow me.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.949
Hold on a second.
Where you going? Hey!

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.825
Where are you taking me?
This is not the way to my place.

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.220
I told you. Dinner.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.486
Dinner?

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:15.961
I'm not going to dinner with you.
You're seeing Nikki.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.091
We're just friends.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.998
Where I come from,
friends don't chew on earlobes.

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.695
Aren't you glad you left?

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.999
-Oh, damn it.
-What?

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.502
I gotta make a quick appearance
at a party.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.113
You just remembered.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.682
It's on the way. We'll be quick.
Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.046
And if I do?

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.653
Then you've been kidnapped.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.497
Hey, Marcus.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.132
Nice house.

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:01.638
What are you doing?
You can't just take that.

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:06.374
Put that back.
You're gonna get us kicked out.

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.777
Not if we sneak out.
