do that to me?

57:40.089 --> 57:41.990
Besides I haven't seen an
explosion like that...

57:42.058 --> 57:44.721
since I smuggled
antiquities out of Egypt.

57:44.794 --> 57:46.956
Yeah. Love you, Mom.

57:47.030 --> 57:50.523
Well, saves me some money
on a hair cut, at least.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.035
No hard feelings, Joe.
Hope your luck changes.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.970

57:56.039 --> 57:58.634
Not right now, just drive.

Hey, hey, Michelle, wait up!

it if you just left.

Oh, man, this is gonna be great.

58:13.556 --> 58:14.683
Michelle.

58:14.757 --> 58:17.556
Joe, I'm working right now and
do not have the temperament.

58:17.627 --> 58:19.220
Please, let me explain.

58:19.295 --> 58:20.923
Explain what?

58:20.997 --> 58:25.492
That you ruined my parents' house with
some outlandish yoga-infused craziness?

58:25.568 --> 58:26.627
No, I...

58:26.703 --> 58:29.673
Look, I have seen klutzy before and
I thought that was adorable...

58:29.739 --> 58:32.231
but today's events,
that was too far.

58:32.308 --> 58:33.936
What is wrong with you?

58:34.010 --> 58:37.742
If I tell you, you promise
not to think I'm crazy?

58:37.814 --> 58:39.612
Go ahead, I'm listening.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.275
Pixies. Pixies?

58:46.756 --> 58:47.756
You think that's funny?

58:47.824 --> 58:48.985
What? Hah!

58:49.058 --> 58:52.756
You think you can win me over by
blaming Pixies for your problems?

58:52.829 --> 58:54.957
No, it's the truth,
absolute truth!

58:55.031 --> 58:56.727
Joe, just go home...

58:56.799 --> 58:58.893

I won't forgive you for.

Stop! I don't have the
patience for this any more.

59:06.776 --> 59:09.075

What are our options?

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:29.144
We could send half of our Pixies
to join another colony.

in allied villages.

let this place go...

We're gonna need
to get you in the shower.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:05.913
Why, so you can trip me again?
Set my room on fire?

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.109
Continue to ruin my life?

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.811
No, no, I never...

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.945
Look, I didn't want to do it.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.320
This was all because of my brother,
and he would have hated this.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:17.827
He always used to tell me to treat
people how you want to be treated.

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:21.955
Do onto others. Huh?

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:26.469
We humans have a saying, "Do onto
others as you want done onto you."

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.528
That sounds like my brother.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:31.540
My mom used to say it.
It's why I gave up.

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:34.133
I deserved your punishment.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:37.510
I think we deserved the same, after
ruining your life for so long.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.241
So now what?

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.341
Now we're gonna stop this
horrible cycle...

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:44.546

something good... together.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.987

First, you're gonna
have a shower...

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.286
and next, I'm gonna
burn that chair.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.555
Good call.

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:00.160
It does feel good
to build something.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:02.603
Pixies are not great builders.

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.000
Magnificent tricksters,
fantastic ruiners...

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:09.512
great smashers, but after we break something,
we never have to put it back together.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:12.048
We really suck
at building things.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.016
Really? Birds build nests out of
sticks in like a day.

Hey, believe me, most things
in life, I don't over think.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:41.477

put some thought into this.

I could take it all back.

each other.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:09:02.403
Joe, um, we forgive you,
and we are also sorry.

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:05.635

would have wanted.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:07.267

still not quite healed yet.

William, I'm so sorry!

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.814
It was never my intention...

Well, Joe, I've been wrong
all along.

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:34.170
It seems we can co-exist...
and peacefully.

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.932

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.265
Dad, William, with everything
Joe's done for us...

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.435
maybe there's something
we can do for him.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.481
Mrs. Mayor, you look
absolutely stunning.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.848
Just stunning!

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.546
Deanna, you must give me
a call sometime next week.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.351
We need to talk TV interviews
for Michelle.

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:58.451
You have my card? Get it off
the desk inside! Ciao!

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:02.221
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:07.859
How's my brilliant artist doing,
on her big night?

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.269
Terrible.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:12.308
Michelle, honey, I know
you've had setbacks...

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.809
but we couldn't push this
opening off any longer.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.711
Use the ones you've repaired
and let's hit it!

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.874
Barbara, they look terrible.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.282
I can't represent myself
like this.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:28.450
Michelle, my dear, you're established,
respected, published and never rejected.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:32.552
In the art world, that means
your mistakes are art.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.460
And everyone will love you
for it.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:36.294
Just say it's part
of the exhibit.

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.960
You can say it represents
the broken world we live in.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.532
Are you sure?
I... oh, I don't know.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.904
I've been doing this
for a long time, honey.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:48.342
Now you've got 300 people who
don't give a rat about the truth.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.743
They just want to see some art.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:55.382
[BARBARA] Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please! Oh...

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.682
Now, without any further
adieu...

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:02.851
let me introduce the lady of the
evening, Miss Michelle Myers.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.894
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Oh, thank you.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.952
Oh... oh my, thank you.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:09.624
That is just so nice,
thank you so much.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:13.658
Well, firstly, I wanted to start
by thanking all of you...

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.432
as my manager Barbara
just did...

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:20.374
for your understanding in regards
to this ever-changing opening day.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.604
This project has been
a long time coming...

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:26.672
and just as I thought I'd reached
the end of this long journey...

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:32.017
fate or circumstance caused some havoc in my
personal life that effected my work here.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:38.316
Um, I am missing some of the
little people for...

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.862
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me.

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:42.796
Uh, hi, hello,
sorry to interrupt.

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.494
Excuse me. Joe...

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:49.561
Special delivery for a Michelle.
Where should I put it?

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.539
Joe, if you so much as...

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:52.870
Trust me.

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:57.777
Um, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that
I do have another guest for my carnival.

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:00.543
Looks like he arrived on-time,
after all.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.682
Trust me, please.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.089
Okay, you're all set.

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:17.333
<i>(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.815
This is unbelievable!
This is going to go viral!

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:39.787
No, better, this is going
to go antibiotic!

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.949
I feel healthier
just watching it.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.356
Wow.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.985
And the delivery guy
was a great touch.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.895
So avent garde,
what showmanship!

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:51.024
Oh, thank you.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.569
They look so real!

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.934
You must have spent a fortune
on these little robots!

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:09.811
This is...

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.547
I can't believe it.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.488
I'm not looking for an apology, I
wouldn't have believed me, either.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.583
I just didn't want you to think
I was making fun of you.

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:18.957
I'll never do that.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.019
And I couldn't show you they're
real, because...

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:23.088
Because we don't exist.

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:26.465
This is a one-time favor
we owed Joe, okay?

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.163
Wh... yeah, I understand.

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.636
It's a really long story.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.107
Are you still mad at me?

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.078
Look at that.
He got the girl, after all.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.514
She is pretty cute...

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.414
for a creature without wings.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.646
I don't see you with a girl.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.552
I don't see you with one,
either.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:50.684
Yeah, well, I've got you
to keep me company, right?

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.421
Always.
