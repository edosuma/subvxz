00:38.223 --> 00:39.848
<i>High school.</i>

00:39.892 --> 00:42.846
<i>It happens to everyone.</i>

00:42.895 --> 00:46.099
<i>And for four years,</i>
<i>it has a way of dividing us.</i>

00:47.442 --> 00:53.232
<i>Athletes, overachievers,</i>
<i>drama queens, misfits, jokers...</i>

00:53.282 --> 00:55.820
<i>But then, just before it ends,</i>

00:55.868 --> 00:57.410
<i>when we're almost out the door...</i>

00:59.163 --> 01:01.619
<i>... one night has a way</i>
<i>of bringing us together.</i>

01:03.251 --> 01:05.492
<i>Prom.</i>

01:13.763 --> 01:15.341
<i>It's the one night</i>
<i>when nobody cares</i>

01:15.390 --> 01:18.474
<i>who wore the varsity jacket</i>
<i>and who got cut from the team.</i>

01:18.518 --> 01:20.226
<i>It's the night when</i>
<i>you might find yourself</i>

01:20.270 --> 01:24.185
<i>singing at the top of your lungs with</i>
<i>people you've never even spoken to.</i>

01:25.734 --> 01:27.193
<i>The night when that cute guy</i>

01:27.236 --> 01:30.024
<i>from your math class</i>
<i>might finally make his move.</i>

01:31.282 --> 01:32.825
<i>Prom's our night,</i>

01:33.869 --> 01:36.739
<i>and each of us wants it</i>
<i>to be unforgettable.</i>

01:37.664 --> 01:41.034
<i>That's why I've been working</i>
<i>all semester to make it perfect.</i>

01:41.877 --> 01:45.081
<i>For me, and for all the seniors</i>
<i>at Brookside High.</i>

01:52.556 --> 01:53.635
Hey, Nova.

01:54.934 --> 01:58.137
<i>We were three weeks away</i>
<i>and everything was going as planned.</i>

02:00.565 --> 02:02.973
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

02:04.444 --> 02:05.607
Has he asked you yet?

02:05.654 --> 02:07.314
It's 8.00 a.m.

02:07.364 --> 02:10.401
He will!
You guys are perfect together.

02:10.910 --> 02:13.697
You're in all the same
AP classes, swim team co-captains,

02:13.746 --> 02:17.246
you've both been, like, class
everything since kindergarten.

02:17.292 --> 02:19.499
Trust me, it's going to happen.

02:19.544 --> 02:20.790
Has he asked you yet?

02:23.048 --> 02:24.922
Well, he will.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.343
He's never once made a move.

02:26.385 --> 02:28.425
Well, he's Brandon. He's shy.

02:29.013 --> 02:31.172
Or, maybe he's just not interested.

02:31.224 --> 02:32.884
Don't you want him to ask you?

02:34.436 --> 02:36.595
Yes, I want him to ask me. It's prom!

02:37.147 --> 02:38.690
Here he comes.

02:38.733 --> 02:40.275
Hey, Nova!

02:41.402 --> 02:43.644
- It's happening.
- Bye.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.109
Wow. Beautiful.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.987
Brandon! Thanks.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.489
Posters look great. Nice job.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.572
Yeah.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.247
I'm gonna do the cafeteria.

02:58.338 --> 02:59.501
Oh.

03:09.725 --> 03:14.269
You know, Rachel, I found that prom
dress you were talking about.

03:16.024 --> 03:19.524
Thanks, Nova. We'll be there.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.359
You know, you could go.

03:26.411 --> 03:27.905
No, thank you.

03:27.954 --> 03:30.909
Prom's like
the Olympics of high school.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.994
You wait four years,
three people have a good time,

03:34.044 --> 03:36.749
and everybody else gets to live
on with shattered dreams.

03:36.797 --> 03:39.799
My stepbrother, folks.
Can you believe he's single?

03:39.842 --> 03:43.378
Come on, Lloyd. Your fear of girls
has gone from cute to clinical.

03:43.430 --> 03:44.710
It's just prom.

03:44.765 --> 03:48.383
Ask somebody. And be creative.

03:48.435 --> 03:52.101
This is your last chance to make anyone
remember you even went here.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.783
Wow. Nova, that looks awesome.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.996
Thanks. Make sure you and Tyler
aren't too late.

04:08.041 --> 04:11.908
We crown prom king and queen
at 9.35. Just saying.

04:15.132 --> 04:17.089
Hey! My queen!

04:18.010 --> 04:19.125
Hey, Tyler.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.005
- Hi, Tyler.
- What's up, man?

04:22.098 --> 04:23.723
So, I saw the posters,

04:23.766 --> 04:25.344
and I thought about you.

04:25.393 --> 04:27.053
And about a party bus.

04:27.104 --> 04:28.432
Oh, yeah!

04:28.480 --> 04:31.268
Hey, Tyler, can we talk?

04:31.317 --> 04:34.437
OK, so you can only listen
to one artist for the rest of your life,

04:34.487 --> 04:37.060
- and Stick Hippo does not exist. Go.
- Oh, man.

04:37.115 --> 04:39.357
No Stick Hippo, the
greatest band of all time?

04:40.994 --> 04:43.781
Jack White. You get three
epic bands, and counting.

04:43.831 --> 04:46.618
Lucas, you blow my mind every day.

04:46.667 --> 04:51.413
OK, next one. Grunge rock supergroup,
1990-96, no Dave Grohl. Go.

04:51.464 --> 04:54.134
Good one. OK, how 'bout...

04:57.304 --> 04:58.335
Look at them.

04:58.388 --> 04:59.966
I want to go to prom.

05:00.015 --> 05:02.720
Well, Megan Brooks went
when she was a sophomore.

05:02.768 --> 05:03.931
So it can totally happen.

05:03.978 --> 05:06.765
It's like they're in a trance.

05:06.814 --> 05:07.846
Yeah.

05:07.899 --> 05:09.441
- See you later.
- Bye.

05:09.484 --> 05:12.770
- Lucas, you gotta ask her out.
- Dude, you're crazy.

05:12.821 --> 05:15.609
She doesn't want to go out with me.
I've got nothing to offer.

05:15.658 --> 05:18.493
No car, no cool parties, no prom.

05:31.676 --> 05:32.707
Check it out.

05:33.386 --> 05:36.802
Prom this year
is gonna be so much fun.

05:36.848 --> 05:42.638
Oh, my gosh. I really want to go
with Dakota. That'd be amazing.

06:11.845 --> 06:16.508
Hey, Rhoda,
I turned 18 last week.

06:16.559 --> 06:18.018
You know what that means, right?

06:18.061 --> 06:20.634
They can try you as an adult?

06:20.689 --> 06:23.180
Rhoda! You break my heart.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.774
It means we can
finally run away together.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.608
You, me, the open road.

06:35.664 --> 06:37.538
So, what are you in for?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.537
Let me guess.
Trouble at the model UN?

06:41.587 --> 06:43.829
Prom poster crisis?

06:43.881 --> 06:46.918
Wait, I know.

06:46.968 --> 06:49.673
You're receiving an award
for most awards.

06:49.721 --> 06:52.212
Actually, I'm in trouble this time.

06:52.265 --> 06:53.261
Really?

06:53.308 --> 06:55.385
They caught me riding around
school on my little moped

06:55.436 --> 06:57.594
- because I think I'm such a rebel.
- It's not a moped.

06:57.647 --> 06:59.936
It's a 1972 Norton Commando.

06:59.982 --> 07:01.441
It's adorable.

07:01.484 --> 07:05.565
Jesse Richter? My office, now.

07:08.158 --> 07:10.780
Nova, I'll have those papers
for you by lunch.

07:16.459 --> 07:19.413
Richter, Richter, Richter.

07:20.130 --> 07:21.838
Let's see.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.589
"Jesse has cut last period

07:25.636 --> 07:28.341
every Monday for four weeks."

07:28.389 --> 07:31.094
- You know what this means?
- I'm consistent?

07:31.142 --> 07:33.515
You do realise you're only
cheating yourself, right?

07:33.562 --> 07:36.563
You know, I had a talk
with myself about that.

07:36.607 --> 07:39.394
Turns out I'm OK with it.

07:39.443 --> 07:41.353
I don't have time for this.

07:43.614 --> 07:46.188
Today it's cutting class. Last month
it's fighting in the cafeteria?

07:46.242 --> 07:49.493
You don't care about anything.
And you and I both know...

07:50.747 --> 07:52.574
...you're going nowhere.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.246
The good news is,
the really good news,

07:55.294 --> 07:57.453
in a month and a half,
that's not gonna be my problem

07:57.505 --> 08:01.634
'cause I'm going on vacation,
and you are gonna disappear forever.

08:01.676 --> 08:04.084
You wanna do that with
a diploma, that's up to you.

08:04.137 --> 08:08.301
Six weeks, Richter. Six weeks.
Do you think you can handle that?

08:08.350 --> 08:11.934
Yeah. I'll leave this place
in one piece for ya.

08:11.979 --> 08:17.401
Because in September,
you're gonna be right back here.

08:19.863 --> 08:21.274
Get to class.

08:26.162 --> 08:27.656
What is this?

08:29.290 --> 08:30.749
An earring?

08:30.792 --> 08:33.710
Very good.
Why was it in your car?

08:33.754 --> 08:38.749
Wait, I know. I drove half the girls'
soccer team to Papa Gino's last week.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.631
You did?

08:40.678 --> 08:44.011
Yes, OK? Now stop acting crazy.
You know you're my girl.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.224
And you're gonna be the prom queen,
up there looking beautiful.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.016
What is it?

08:52.316 --> 08:53.514
You need to ask me.

08:53.568 --> 08:56.937
I know, OK? Don't worry.
I've got plans.

08:59.699 --> 09:02.369
Here. For the soccer team.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.114
I got it! I got it!

09:09.335 --> 09:10.249
Pick it up.

09:13.131 --> 09:14.294
Come on, you guys.

09:17.094 --> 09:18.636
I got it. I got...

09:21.098 --> 09:22.343
- OK.
- You guys got it?

09:22.391 --> 09:24.431
- Yep. You guys all right?
- Yeah.

09:24.477 --> 09:26.719
- Feel like I'm carrying all the weight.
- Me too.

09:26.771 --> 09:28.230
I feel like you're
carrying all the weight.

09:28.273 --> 09:29.304
Lower it.

09:29.357 --> 09:31.066
- Careful of the stars.
- Let it down.

09:31.109 --> 09:32.901
Hey, man, relax.

09:35.614 --> 09:39.114
- OK.
- Are we... done?

09:39.160 --> 09:41.865
- What?
- Well...

09:41.913 --> 09:44.618
...that was the last
of our prom decorations.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.246
But we still
have to figure out a floor plan,

09:48.295 --> 09:50.003
come up with a schedule
of who's selling tickets,

09:50.047 --> 09:52.455
get the voting system down
for prom king and queen, and...

09:54.177 --> 09:58.175
But you know what?
I can totally do that stuff later.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.141
So, you guys are... done.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.347
Yay!

10:03.562 --> 10:07.607
In three weeks, "Starry Night"
will be Brookside's best prom ever.

10:08.443 --> 10:10.352
Our theme is "Starry Night"?

10:13.657 --> 10:14.688
Yeah.

10:15.617 --> 10:16.649
Cool.

10:17.495 --> 10:20.745
I can't thank you guys enough
for all your hard work,

10:20.790 --> 10:24.622
but when those couples walk through
the door and see how perfect it is,

10:24.669 --> 10:26.958
it's gonna be so worth it.

10:27.005 --> 10:31.632
Plus, you each get two
free tickets to prom. Ali.

10:31.677 --> 10:33.052
Awesome. Thank you.

10:33.095 --> 10:34.720
- Mei.
- Thank you.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.804
- Rolo.
- Sweet!

10:36.849 --> 10:39.341
- Brandon.
- Thank you.

10:43.857 --> 10:47.440
So, Rolo, who are you
gonna take to prom?

10:47.486 --> 10:49.894
My girlfriend. Athena.

10:49.947 --> 10:52.071
- Athena?
- She's Greek.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.285
And where does she live?

10:54.327 --> 10:58.539
- Canada.
- So, she's Greek-Canadian?

10:58.582 --> 11:01.252
There's a very vibrant
Greek culture in Canada.

11:02.211 --> 11:04.003
Vibrant.

11:04.046 --> 11:06.834
So, how did Justin take it when
you told him about New York?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.801
I haven't exactly told him yet.

11:09.845 --> 11:12.929
Mei, you have to tell him.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.346
He thinks you're staying here
and going to Michigan with him.

11:15.392 --> 11:18.560
You got into Parsons.
It's a huge deal.

11:18.604 --> 11:20.977
I know, but I haven't
decided if I'm going.

11:21.024 --> 11:23.811
It'll be like breaking up
with him. How can I do that?

11:23.860 --> 11:26.565
Hey, hey, hey!
Prom's looking good.

11:26.613 --> 11:28.737
Guess I better find
a hot girl to go with.

11:28.782 --> 11:30.028
Right.

11:31.577 --> 11:33.985
- What are you doing here?
- Come with me.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.498
Bye, guys.

11:40.379 --> 11:41.244
Right here.

11:42.756 --> 11:45.461
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

11:58.607 --> 12:01.692
"P." It's for
the paralysing crush I had

12:01.736 --> 12:05.236
on the new girl in my math
class in the eighth grade.

12:05.281 --> 12:09.861
Her name was Mei,
and she was awesome.

12:09.912 --> 12:10.825
"R."

12:10.871 --> 12:13.742
It's for the really long time it took me
to get up the nerve to ask her out.

12:15.626 --> 12:18.912
"O" is for the only girl
I've ever called my girlfriend,

12:18.963 --> 12:21.419
and the only one I ever want to.

12:21.466 --> 12:25.167
And "M"...is for
University of Michigan, of course.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.712
Because that's our
next chapter together.

12:27.765 --> 12:32.724
But I'm getting ahead of myself,
because before graduation and college

12:32.770 --> 12:36.056
and the rest of our lives together,
there's something that I need to ask.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.819
Yes! Yes!

12:56.338 --> 13:00.633
Hey! Hey! Prom?

13:00.677 --> 13:02.301
Yes! Yes!

13:09.645 --> 13:10.760
Yes!

13:25.371 --> 13:28.040
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.464
Darrell. Come on.
Get him. Let's go.

13:44.517 --> 13:47.721
Come on. Don't...

13:47.771 --> 13:49.645
Darrell.
Darrell!

13:55.571 --> 13:56.816
Looks like it's just us.

13:56.864 --> 13:58.988
Yeah.

13:59.033 --> 14:02.284
Do you have a minute? I was...
I was hoping to talk to you alone.

14:03.789 --> 14:06.790
Yeah. Sure. What do you
want to talk about?

14:08.043 --> 14:09.206
It's about prom.

14:09.253 --> 14:11.163
Oh.

14:11.214 --> 14:14.298
We've been working on the prom
committee now for several months,

14:14.342 --> 14:16.631
and, since we're on the committee,

14:16.678 --> 14:19.514
I think it's a good idea for us
to arrive a little early on prom night.

14:19.556 --> 14:22.344
You know, make sure
everything's copacetic.

14:23.853 --> 14:26.724
I suppose that makes sense.

14:26.773 --> 14:31.067
So, driving-wise, we should go together.

14:33.447 --> 14:36.021
You want to...

14:36.075 --> 14:37.534
Carpool.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.163
Right.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.918
Well, you know, people
get so carried away

14:46.962 --> 14:49.418
with the whole prom date thing.

14:49.465 --> 14:51.458
I say why not be practical
about it, you know?

14:54.303 --> 14:56.012
Brandon, I...

14:56.055 --> 14:59.555
Is that a yes?

15:00.811 --> 15:02.186
I'd love to.

15:03.272 --> 15:04.303
OK, then.

15:06.776 --> 15:08.567
Here you go.

15:10.989 --> 15:12.816
Or do you want me to hold on to it?

15:16.203 --> 15:17.745
So it's a date.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.416
And Ethan got to be line leader
because it was his birthday.

15:23.461 --> 15:26.462
But my birthday's in July,
which is totally unfair.

15:26.506 --> 15:27.502
Totally.

15:27.549 --> 15:31.298
Every summer birthday gets celebrated on
one day at the end of the school year.

15:31.345 --> 15:34.761
And there are like six of us.
And two of them are girls.

15:34.807 --> 15:36.515
And they made Mike S. line leader first

15:36.559 --> 15:38.682
and his birthday
isn't even until August,

15:38.728 --> 15:40.472
so I said... Mom!

15:40.522 --> 15:42.894
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?

15:42.941 --> 15:46.310
Well, the place was dead,
so Lou gave me the afternoon off.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.067
- I actually get to see my kids.
- Cool!

15:50.241 --> 15:51.984
You see what came in the mail?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.032
Wanna try it on?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.745
Nah. Since you're here,
I think I'll call work

15:58.792 --> 16:00.536
and see if I can pick up
some extra hours.

16:00.586 --> 16:01.997
Come on, sweetie.
Let's all take tonight off.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.457
Who keeps opening this door?

16:04.715 --> 16:07.088
There's nothing
but garbage down there.

16:09.220 --> 16:12.257
Dad, if Mom got the hang
of this, then you can, too.

16:13.225 --> 16:14.221
Here. Watch.

16:14.268 --> 16:17.269
Just click this, and... There we are.

16:17.313 --> 16:18.427
Wow.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.023
- Hold on.
- What?

16:23.778 --> 16:26.151
You just have a little grease.

16:26.198 --> 16:27.443
See?

16:27.491 --> 16:29.614
It's paying off already.

16:30.411 --> 16:32.202
Boy. I don't know about this.

16:32.246 --> 16:33.871
It's super easy.

16:33.915 --> 16:37.118
Make sure I'm online. And then
choose me from the contacts menu.

16:37.168 --> 16:40.039
And next fall, we can talk
whenever you want.

16:40.088 --> 16:43.458
OK. How 'bout midnight?
Every night of the week.

16:45.135 --> 16:46.962
I don't know about that, Dad.

16:50.141 --> 16:53.345
Georgetown on a scholarship, boy.

16:53.395 --> 16:56.100
It's just like we always
talked about, huh?

16:57.149 --> 16:59.854
You heading off
to achieve great things.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.777
It's the heading off part I'm just...

17:05.450 --> 17:07.692
...having a little trouble with.
That's all.

17:09.704 --> 17:10.867
Dad.

17:17.046 --> 17:21.874
You deserve an awesome prom,
so... why wait?

17:28.183 --> 17:29.298
Wow.

17:30.561 --> 17:33.432
Tyler, this is beautiful.

17:33.481 --> 17:37.775
Told you I had plans. And what is prom
without a romantic dinner?

17:38.987 --> 17:40.398
You got Taco King.

17:40.447 --> 17:42.689
Vegetarian burrito, extra guac.

17:44.785 --> 17:46.529
So...

17:49.374 --> 17:52.660
...will you go with me?
To prom?

17:52.711 --> 17:54.585
Yes.

18:02.013 --> 18:03.424
Come on.

19:11.007 --> 19:12.631
Thanks, Tyler.

20:17.497 --> 20:19.075
Whoa.

20:20.501 --> 20:22.707
It's like Apocalypse Prom.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.793
Hey, there.

20:24.839 --> 20:26.879
How you doing, Nova?

20:26.925 --> 20:28.585
Nova, what do we do now?

20:28.635 --> 20:30.462
Yeah. Is prom, like, cancelled?

20:30.512 --> 20:32.552
We could always postpone
till after graduation.

20:34.141 --> 20:35.172
No.

20:35.226 --> 20:37.384
I don't wanna tell
the entire senior class

20:37.436 --> 20:39.844
to return their dresses,
cancel their dates.

20:39.897 --> 20:42.899
- If we do that, then...
- The terrorists have won?

20:44.027 --> 20:45.901
People are counting on us.

20:45.946 --> 20:47.855
Prom's three weeks away.

20:47.906 --> 20:50.445
So we work before school.
After school.

20:50.493 --> 20:54.325
I would, but I can't.
I'm starting my internship.

20:54.372 --> 20:56.579
And I'm...
I'm in the spring musical.

20:56.624 --> 20:59.460
Yeah, man. I mean, this was already
my hardest class this semester.

20:59.503 --> 21:03.287
I'm tapped out. I got nothing left.

21:05.384 --> 21:06.214
Brandon?

21:06.260 --> 21:10.555
Nova. AP tests are coming.
I'm already behind.

21:10.598 --> 21:12.840
We need to get these kids
back into class, OK?

21:12.893 --> 21:15.265
There has to be
something we can do.

21:15.729 --> 21:16.760
Nova?

21:18.065 --> 21:21.351
Mr Dunnan, the prom decorations
are completely destroyed.

21:21.402 --> 21:23.359
Nova, I know.

21:23.404 --> 21:26.406
The prom committee
worked very, very hard.

21:26.449 --> 21:30.744
Everything was in that shed.
There's no one left to help me.

21:30.788 --> 21:34.786
Mr Dunnan, what are we
gonna do? What are you...

21:34.834 --> 21:36.245
- Bill.
- Sir.

21:36.294 --> 21:39.877
- Principal Dunnan? Mr Dunnan?
- Richter!

21:41.132 --> 21:42.793
Get that pile of junk
off of school grounds.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.800
- You can't ride that back here.
- Right. Sorry.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.882
Wouldn't want any school
property to get damaged.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.055
You think it's funny
when people's hard work gets destroyed?

21:50.101 --> 21:52.307
It's just a bunch
of dumb prom decorations.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.180
Wait. No. Prom's ruined.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.770
The boys and girls of Brookside
have been robbed of their right

21:57.818 --> 22:00.356
to stand around in a gym
and drink punch.

22:01.739 --> 22:04.111
Put the flags at half mast.

22:04.158 --> 22:07.076
I got a better idea.
You're gonna help her rebuild.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.029
- What?
- What?!

22:09.080 --> 22:11.287
Nova, you need help.
Richter, you clearly need

22:11.333 --> 22:13.373
a way to stay out of trouble
for the next couple of weeks.

22:13.418 --> 22:16.539
Him? Mr Dunnan,
I really don't think he...

22:16.589 --> 22:18.747
Little Miss Sunshine's right.
You should listen to her.

22:18.799 --> 22:21.172
No. You're gonna do it.

22:21.219 --> 22:22.927
Who knows?
You might even learn something

22:22.971 --> 22:24.595
about hard work and dedication.

22:24.639 --> 22:29.717
And if this prom isn't rebuilt to her
specifications, you won't graduate.

22:29.770 --> 22:32.059
You can't do that! You can't
keep me from graduating.

22:32.106 --> 22:34.514
You know what? I had a talk
with myself about that...

22:35.485 --> 22:37.193
...turns out I'm OK with it.

22:50.877 --> 22:52.668
Hey, guys.

22:52.712 --> 22:53.578
Hi, you.

22:55.048 --> 22:58.418
- What's with the helmets?
- Varsity made us wear them.

22:58.469 --> 23:01.007
- It's... humiliating.
- I think it's cute.

23:01.055 --> 23:04.756
Yeah? We could get you one.
Maybe it'll catch on.

23:04.809 --> 23:08.807
Well, you could get
me pink. It'd match my outfit.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.726
That'd be pretty. And safe.

23:11.775 --> 23:14.148
Well, I need a serious cram session
for the elements test.

23:14.195 --> 23:17.149
Yeah. Any time.
Just think of me as your lab partner.

23:17.198 --> 23:19.072
You are my lab partner.

23:20.076 --> 23:22.283
- Good point.
- I'll see you guys later.

23:24.456 --> 23:25.950
Are you OK?

23:25.999 --> 23:27.743
Yeah. Fine. Helmet.

23:29.295 --> 23:32.331
Your sister's right.
There are tons of girls out there

23:32.382 --> 23:34.125
who'd be thrilled to go
to prom with you.

23:34.175 --> 23:36.251
All you have to do is ask one of them.

23:36.303 --> 23:39.589
Thank you, Oprah,
for that nugget of wisdom.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.641
You can do it.
Just be... Lloyd.

23:42.685 --> 23:46.386
That hasn't exactly worked out
for me, like, ever.

23:46.439 --> 23:49.226
She's right. It's not that hard.

23:49.275 --> 23:52.775
This coming from the guy who hasn't
asked anyone out since middle school.

23:52.821 --> 23:54.861
You guys have been together forever.

23:54.907 --> 23:57.480
Your whole lives are planned out.
Next year...

23:57.535 --> 24:00.986
Dude, I just don't understand how your
sister convinced you to ask someone.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.874
You've been ignoring my advice
for years. Right, Mei?

24:03.917 --> 24:07.452
Lloyd, she's out there.
Now go find her.

24:21.061 --> 24:22.721
So do you think
you're gonna go to prom?

24:22.771 --> 24:24.016
I don't know yet. It depends.

24:26.192 --> 24:30.521
Do you know what? I really wanna go.
Only if he asks me, like...

24:30.571 --> 24:34.486
Alice, you know he's gonna
ask you. So, it'll be OK.

24:35.452 --> 24:37.741
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.868
Who did this?

24:40.916 --> 24:44.083
- I don't know.
- I mean,

24:44.128 --> 24:47.580
what kind of sick twist would put creepy
serial killer letters

24:47.632 --> 24:49.175
on a person's locker?

24:50.302 --> 24:52.876
- It's OK.
- Oh, God!

24:52.930 --> 24:55.088
What did I do wrong?

24:56.767 --> 24:59.093
- So?
- I was never here. You never saw me.

24:59.938 --> 25:01.100
Lloyd?

25:03.608 --> 25:05.435
Come on, guys. Work it.

25:07.404 --> 25:08.733
Well, now you
have to ask her out.

25:08.781 --> 25:11.699
- I don't know, dude.
- You're killing me here, man.

25:13.703 --> 25:14.699
There you go, fellas.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.703
We totally had that.

25:16.748 --> 25:19.453
Hey, Lucas.
You're looking good out there, bro.

25:19.501 --> 25:20.912
- Really?
- He is?

25:20.961 --> 25:22.337
You've got real varsity potential.

25:22.379 --> 25:24.705
He does?

25:26.634 --> 25:27.963
I gotta go.

25:28.011 --> 25:30.003
Wow. Thanks, Tyler.

25:30.055 --> 25:33.091
Hey, I'm having a team barbecue
on Thursday. You should swing by.

25:33.141 --> 25:34.684
- Really?
- Yeah. Totally casual.

25:34.726 --> 25:35.675
Bring a friend if you want.

25:35.728 --> 25:36.973
Corey?

25:38.898 --> 25:41.056
I was thinking more
like a girl, Lucas.

25:41.109 --> 25:42.484
Oh. Right.

25:42.527 --> 25:43.986
You know some of those,
don't you?

25:44.028 --> 25:46.401
Yeah. Of course. Tons.

25:46.448 --> 25:48.773
All right. See you there, bro.

25:51.787 --> 25:53.246
Here you go.

26:14.855 --> 26:19.184
Just some dumb prom decorations and
you're going to help her rebuild them.

26:19.234 --> 26:23.529
Yeah. Sure he is. If he
ever bothered to show up.

26:30.038 --> 26:31.532
Glad you could make it.

26:32.708 --> 26:34.701
No place I'd rather be.

26:37.755 --> 26:40.959
Great. You know what?

26:41.009 --> 26:44.295
Why don't you move
that stuff from there...

26:45.347 --> 26:47.969
...to over there.

26:49.518 --> 26:51.392
Do you think
you can handle that?

27:21.012 --> 27:22.672
Ow.

27:22.722 --> 27:24.513
Problem?

27:26.268 --> 27:30.017
No. I was just taking
inventory of this...

27:32.274 --> 27:36.107
...bucket.
- That would be one.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.784
You want some help with that?

27:44.246 --> 27:46.073
Yeah. Sure.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.286
Why don't you give it a long,

27:47.333 --> 27:50.369
brooding stare until it carries
itself across the room.

28:00.598 --> 28:03.718
Wait. Nova, hold on a second.

28:05.853 --> 28:07.763
I just wanna say one thing.

28:10.692 --> 28:12.270
Lift from the legs.

28:14.029 --> 28:16.984
He's a menace.
A rude, arrogant menace

28:17.033 --> 28:18.906
who'd rather look down
on everyone else

28:18.951 --> 28:21.988
than make any effort
of his own. And he was late.

28:22.038 --> 28:24.364
I don't know if Dunnan is doing
this to punish him or me.

28:24.416 --> 28:25.447
What's his name again?

28:25.500 --> 28:27.540
- Is that Jesse Richter?
- Yeah.

28:27.586 --> 28:30.338
That that punk that stocks
shelves down at the market?

28:30.381 --> 28:31.579
I think he works there.

28:31.632 --> 28:34.005
Well. Well, I used to
run with his dad, OK?

28:34.052 --> 28:35.676
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.843
Is there any chance Jesse
might actually help you?

28:37.889 --> 28:40.345
Kitty, he's a punk, all right?

28:40.392 --> 28:43.014
He's not gonna all of a sudden
turn into an upright citizen.

28:43.062 --> 28:44.093
I didn't say that.

28:44.146 --> 28:46.056
I'm just saying it seems like you could
use some help, Nova.

28:46.107 --> 28:48.230
Three weeks isn't a lot of time.

28:48.276 --> 28:50.482
Yeah, help, sure. But he's a...

28:50.528 --> 28:53.446
- He's a walking misdemeanour.
- Thank you, Dad.

28:54.324 --> 28:55.949
"I'm a tough guy.

28:55.993 --> 28:59.492
I have long hair
and drive a motorcycle.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.994
I can lift heavy things."

29:02.041 --> 29:03.322
Whoop-iddy-doo.

29:04.085 --> 29:05.793
Be right back.

29:07.464 --> 29:08.875
You should see this guy, Dad.

29:08.924 --> 29:11.332
It's like he enjoys watching me suffer.

29:11.385 --> 29:14.339
This kid gives you any more trouble,
you just come to me, OK?

29:14.388 --> 29:16.962
- Nova, it's Brandon.
- Hey, Mrs Prescott.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.852
Brandon. Hey, invite him in.
I'II... I'll set another place.

29:19.894 --> 29:21.139
Yeah.

29:26.110 --> 29:29.027
- Brandon, what are you doing...
- I got into Princeton!

29:29.071 --> 29:32.073
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Yeah!

29:32.116 --> 29:34.275
Thank you. That's not all.

29:34.327 --> 29:36.201
I'm a finalist
for the dean's scholarship.

29:36.246 --> 29:38.239
That's amazing.

29:38.290 --> 29:41.042
The interview for the scholarship,

29:41.085 --> 29:45.035
it's the same weekend as prom.

29:49.719 --> 29:52.804
- Oh.
- I hate to leave you hanging.

29:52.848 --> 29:58.554
No. I, I...
I totally get it.

29:58.604 --> 30:02.982
There's still some time for you
to find another date, right?

30:03.026 --> 30:06.146
Yeah. Totally. I'll be fine.

30:06.196 --> 30:09.067
- Fine.
- All right. Cool.

30:10.451 --> 30:11.482
Cool.

30:12.703 --> 30:14.530
I just can't believe
he would do this to you.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.154
- I mean, two weeks before.
- Yeah. He's a jerk.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.619
- A loser.
- I hate him.

30:18.668 --> 30:20.661
- I've always hated him.
- He's an idiot.

30:20.712 --> 30:23.204
Guys, it's not that
big of a deal. Honest.

30:23.257 --> 30:27.385
Besides, prom's not even close to being
ready. I still have a ton to do.

30:27.428 --> 30:29.421
But who are you gonna go with?

30:32.392 --> 30:35.014
Well, lots of people
go to prom without dates.

30:35.062 --> 30:37.185
No. You don't have
to do all this, Nova.

30:37.231 --> 30:39.603
- Yeah.
- Just because Brandon bailed on me

30:39.650 --> 30:41.773
doesn't mean I'm gonna bail
on the senior class.

30:42.862 --> 30:44.689
I'm fine. Now go.

30:45.949 --> 30:47.408
Go.

31:08.724 --> 31:09.755
Hey.

31:24.158 --> 31:25.189
Wait.

31:42.345 --> 31:44.552
It's a varsity party
and Tyler invited me.

31:44.597 --> 31:45.629
- No way.
- No, really.

31:45.682 --> 31:47.260
And he told me to bring a girl.

31:47.309 --> 31:49.136
Wow. Tyler Barso's barbecue.

31:49.186 --> 31:52.187
That's almost a "triumphant
Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock" moment.

31:52.231 --> 31:54.805
- Really?
- Well...

31:54.859 --> 31:58.109
No. That could be your
Hendrix moment.

31:58.154 --> 31:59.814
- Hi.
- Hey, Simone.

32:00.991 --> 32:02.865
But first, fly check.

32:02.910 --> 32:06.493
Pit check. OK.
Now breathe on me.

32:06.539 --> 32:08.413
- Wait, why?
- You wanna ask her out with butt mouth?

32:08.457 --> 32:10.367
I don't think so. Come on. Hit me.

32:11.544 --> 32:14.711
I didn't get anything. Hit me again.

32:14.756 --> 32:16.298
- Dude.
- I just had a cough drop, all right?

32:16.341 --> 32:18.833
My olfactory nerves are compromised.
Come on.

32:21.055 --> 32:23.546
What are you guys doing?

32:24.642 --> 32:26.137
- Extra credit!
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:26.186 --> 32:30.266
- I gotta go.
- He's... weird.

32:30.315 --> 32:31.691
Yeah.

32:33.027 --> 32:36.692
So, I'm glad
you're here today.

32:36.739 --> 32:39.776
I mean, I knew you'd be here.
This is our class.

32:39.826 --> 32:42.115
Not that you never miss class
or anything.

32:42.162 --> 32:44.618
I mean, you don't miss a lot of class.

32:44.665 --> 32:47.535
You have excellent attendance
as far as I can tell.

32:49.003 --> 32:50.082
I try.

32:51.631 --> 32:53.789
There's a lacrosse team barbecue
on Thursday

32:53.841 --> 32:55.170
and I was wondering
if you wanted to go with me.

32:55.218 --> 32:59.168
I mean, unless you have a lacrosse
issue, which some people do, sometimes.

32:59.222 --> 33:00.966
- That sounds like fun.
- Really?

33:01.016 --> 33:02.641
Yeah. I love barbecues.

33:04.937 --> 33:06.597
She loves barbecues.

33:07.690 --> 33:10.608
Cool.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.867
We start every day at three.

33:25.919 --> 33:28.244
Dude, relax. It's 3.15.

33:29.006 --> 33:32.707
I'm not a dude,
and I know what time it is. You're late.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.503
All right, dude.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.091
What's this supposed to be?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.766
It's a celestial fountain.

33:40.769 --> 33:44.387
Well, it's gonna leak
all over the "celestial" floor

33:44.440 --> 33:46.479
unless you purge the line
and unclog the intake.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.610
I know that.

34:07.716 --> 34:10.254
- Hey, Rolo.
- Hey.

34:10.302 --> 34:13.552
Can I see Athena's profile?

34:13.597 --> 34:15.424
No. She doesn't have one.

34:15.474 --> 34:18.012
Really? No profile?

34:18.060 --> 34:22.141
Actually, she had to take her page down
'cause she got grounded.

34:25.652 --> 34:27.230
What's she in for?

34:27.279 --> 34:29.355
She was out clubbin' till late.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.911
So Athena likes to get
up in the club, huh?

34:34.954 --> 34:39.118
Yeah. Big time.

34:43.672 --> 34:45.831
Sweet!

35:03.152 --> 35:05.026
Come on. Come on.

35:11.245 --> 35:13.617
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Stop, sir!

35:13.664 --> 35:15.123
Stop, truck!

35:15.166 --> 35:19.709
No, no! Jen.

35:21.506 --> 35:23.914
Jen, you missed it!
There was a sign!

35:26.011 --> 35:29.463
No! No!

35:33.102 --> 35:35.261
OK. Come on, baby.

35:37.899 --> 35:39.809
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

35:39.860 --> 35:42.612
And... it's leaking.

35:43.656 --> 35:46.147
Yes, it is. Happy?

35:46.200 --> 35:47.659
Amused.

35:48.411 --> 35:51.531
You act all tough,
but I know you.

35:51.581 --> 35:55.532
You're the guy who cried when the class
hamster died in third grade.

35:55.586 --> 35:58.753
Yeah, well, Heady didn't
make me build a cosmic canopy.

36:00.049 --> 36:01.793
You remember her name?

36:01.843 --> 36:04.417
You just need a hamster
to love, don't you?

36:09.393 --> 36:11.101
This is a disaster.

36:11.145 --> 36:14.929
A hurricane's a disaster.
Smallpox. Locusts.

36:14.983 --> 36:18.518
Those are disasters.
This is just a fountain.

36:18.570 --> 36:20.029
And it's just prom.

36:20.072 --> 36:21.352
Just prom?

36:21.406 --> 36:24.858
Yeah. Lame DJ, balloons,
poofy dresses.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.108
Not something to get
so worked up about.

36:26.162 --> 36:28.119
I forgot. School functions

36:28.164 --> 36:31.533
conflict with your "thinking that I'm
better than everyone" time.

36:31.584 --> 36:34.705
Well, for the rest of us,
prom happens to be fun.

36:34.755 --> 36:38.456
Not for the guys. You gotta buy dinner.
You gotta get the little flower thing.

36:38.509 --> 36:40.383
Don't pretend
you don't know what it's called.

36:40.428 --> 36:42.753
And then there's the tuxedo,
the ultimate symbol of conformity

36:42.805 --> 36:44.430
that a bunch of other guys
have already sweated in.

36:44.474 --> 36:47.475
Whereas you opt
for the long hair and black jacket.

36:47.519 --> 36:51.434
The whole "motorcycle" thing.
The ultimate symbol of nonconformity.

36:51.482 --> 36:54.055
At least I don't wear it posing
in front of some stupid backdrop.

36:54.110 --> 36:56.945
- People keep those pictures forever.
- In a box in their attic.

36:56.988 --> 36:59.906
A lot of people worked
really hard on prom.

36:59.949 --> 37:01.444
And it all burned down.

37:13.214 --> 37:16.132
Look, I'm sorry.

37:16.176 --> 37:18.845
Prom is obviously really
important to you.

37:18.887 --> 37:21.723
I just don't get it.

37:21.765 --> 37:23.557
All this for one night.

37:25.561 --> 37:27.850
Yeah, you're right.

37:29.107 --> 37:33.853
But... it's the last night,

37:34.738 --> 37:37.360
and it's the last dance.

37:37.408 --> 37:41.453
And for that one night, who we were
for four years of high school...

37:41.496 --> 37:43.405
...it doesn't matter.

37:43.456 --> 37:48.285
It's just all of us together
in this one perfect moment.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.964
And I wanna be a part of that.

38:06.023 --> 38:08.693
- It should be this next block.
- Thanks for driving, Corey.

38:08.734 --> 38:12.780
Yeah, sure thing.
I'm a driver. I can drive.

38:12.822 --> 38:15.444
As long as it's during daylight hours
and with adult supervision.

38:15.492 --> 38:16.358
Now, slow down.

38:16.410 --> 38:19.079
What is that sound? I could swear
it's my mom nagging me, but no,

38:19.121 --> 38:22.490
that's impossible since she promised
to be quiet during this car ride.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.665
- Use your signal.
- Mom.

38:30.717 --> 38:32.509
- Aren't you coming, Corey?
- Right.

38:32.553 --> 38:34.380
- Only Lucas was invited.
- Silence.

38:34.430 --> 38:36.470
But it's a team barbecue.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.719
Yeah, it is, but it's... varsity.

38:39.769 --> 38:41.679
Everybody's in the back. Go ahead.

38:41.730 --> 38:43.936
- Hey, Tyler, what's up, man?
- My man, what's up

38:43.982 --> 38:47.648
Oh. That explains it.

38:47.695 --> 38:50.150
You kids have fun... without me.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.941
If you guys need a ride before sundown,

38:51.991 --> 38:54.661
you know,
just give me a call. I'll be here.

38:54.702 --> 38:58.914
Hello, hello. What's up?
Lucas, you made it.

38:58.957 --> 39:01.579
What's up, man? This is Simone.

39:02.837 --> 39:03.832
We've met.

39:05.298 --> 39:07.125
Really?

39:08.593 --> 39:10.337
Doesn't everyone know Tyler Barso?

39:10.387 --> 39:11.964
Hey, you know what?

39:12.013 --> 39:13.342
Come inside.
Let me show you guys around.

39:16.644 --> 39:18.138
Come on.

39:18.187 --> 39:20.346
- Hey, my man.
- Hey, what's up?

39:20.398 --> 39:24.526
- Hey, Tyler, what's up?
- Sean!

39:24.569 --> 39:27.405
- Tyler!
- What's up, buddy?

39:27.447 --> 39:30.235
I'll be right back, OK?

39:30.284 --> 39:35.659
Hey, ladies. This is, this
is Lucas, and he's on the team.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.201
Oh, yeah? What position are you?

39:37.250 --> 39:38.910
Seated, usually.

39:41.672 --> 39:42.834
You're funny.

39:48.638 --> 39:51.010
- Hey.
- Don't talk to me.

39:51.057 --> 39:53.050
Come on.
Don't play it like that.

39:53.101 --> 39:54.560
I'm glad you're here. I miss you.

39:54.603 --> 39:56.227
I had no idea this was your party.

39:56.271 --> 39:57.386
Are you sure about that?

39:57.439 --> 39:59.479
There wasn't
a teeny, tiny part of you

39:59.525 --> 40:00.984
that wanted to see me, too?

40:10.704 --> 40:12.993
How many more twinkly
lights do we really need?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.203
A lot.

40:21.925 --> 40:23.419
You collect these things?

40:26.597 --> 40:27.628
Kind of.

40:27.681 --> 40:29.341
Whenever I have an event:

40:29.391 --> 40:32.975
college tour, scholarship
dinner, awards banquet,

40:33.020 --> 40:35.227
I always just stick 'em there.

40:37.192 --> 40:39.648
I know, it's kinda dorky.

40:41.155 --> 40:43.860
No. It's impressive.

40:57.548 --> 41:02.839
- No. Not this song.
- You hate this song, too?

41:02.887 --> 41:05.461
There's like eight words in it
and two of them are "party."

41:06.892 --> 41:07.888
If this were my world,

41:07.934 --> 41:11.102
Corey and I would have veto power for
all music released into the airwaves.

41:12.231 --> 41:14.188
Really? Just you guys?

41:14.233 --> 41:16.273
Well, you too, if you wanted.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.028
Yeah, thanks.

41:20.949 --> 41:26.027
So, do you just talk the talk
or can you walk the walk?

41:27.540 --> 41:28.405
Do I play?

41:30.293 --> 41:32.036
No. I don't.

41:32.086 --> 41:33.664
You wanna learn?

41:36.049 --> 41:37.081
Here.

41:41.764 --> 41:43.472
Put your hand like this.

41:49.105 --> 41:51.478
No. OK.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.228
That's a "C."

41:56.280 --> 41:57.691
C.

41:59.075 --> 42:00.700
Yes, but you have to strum.

42:04.372 --> 42:06.164
OK, wait, wait.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.336
OK, try now.

42:14.133 --> 42:17.384
There you go. You'll be
a rock god in no time.

42:17.429 --> 42:18.757
Do you have a boyfriend?

42:20.849 --> 42:21.881
I'm sorry.

42:21.934 --> 42:23.761
I mean, it's none of my business.

42:23.811 --> 42:26.183
C, C, C, C.

42:26.230 --> 42:29.516
No, it's OK.

42:31.027 --> 42:33.067
There was one guy.

42:34.323 --> 42:36.861
But it turns out
he's not exactly available.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.110
Sorry.

42:42.415 --> 42:45.250
It's fine. I'm over it.

42:46.628 --> 42:49.036
It's perfect! She doesn't
have a boyfriend, she told me.

42:49.089 --> 42:50.749
- And she plays guitar.
- Lucas.

42:50.799 --> 42:52.258
I mean, it's just
like you said, right?

42:52.301 --> 42:54.543
- You never listen to what I say.
- She's into me.

42:54.595 --> 42:56.255
Which is why I'm gonna ask her
to study as soon as I see...

42:56.305 --> 42:57.301
Hey.

42:57.348 --> 43:00.100
- Did you forget what day it is?
- Friday?

43:00.143 --> 43:04.011
Yes, which we've established and
designated as "Stick Hippo T-shirt day."

43:04.690 --> 43:05.686
Where's yours?

43:05.733 --> 43:07.642
I guess I forgot.

43:09.320 --> 43:13.069
All right. Well, I have an extra,
you know, for emergencies...

43:13.616 --> 43:15.526
Tyler! Great party, bro!

43:15.577 --> 43:16.857
Hey, you the man, Luke!

43:18.956 --> 43:21.079
"Luke"?

43:30.677 --> 43:35.636
Mei? You have a very important
decision to make.

43:35.683 --> 43:37.640
What?

43:37.685 --> 43:42.478
And I want you to know that
whatever you decide, I support.

43:42.524 --> 43:44.351
What are you talking about?

43:44.401 --> 43:47.651
The limo. Both Mark
and Izzy want white,

43:47.696 --> 43:52.109
but I said I thought you and I were more
the classic black types.

43:53.828 --> 43:56.284
- Aren't we?
- I guess...

43:56.331 --> 43:58.288
What's wrong?

44:02.087 --> 44:05.539
It's just...
Do I get any say in this?

44:05.591 --> 44:06.587
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.

44:06.634 --> 44:08.425
How many other things
have you figured out?

44:08.469 --> 44:10.676
I mean, who says
I even wanted a limo?

44:12.974 --> 44:16.640
All right. Look, we don't have
to decide this right now.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.980
Forget I said anything.

44:28.533 --> 44:30.526
Go for it!

44:30.577 --> 44:33.033
OK, what do I say?

44:33.080 --> 44:35.832
Just pretend you're a normal person.

44:37.877 --> 44:38.908
OK.

44:44.635 --> 44:47.422
Hi, Kristen! It's Lloyd.

44:47.471 --> 44:49.049
I'm in your Civics class.

44:49.098 --> 44:52.218
- Really?
- You lent me a pencil.

44:52.268 --> 44:54.095
I was like,
"Do you have a pencil?"

44:54.145 --> 44:56.767
And you were like, "Yes."
So, I brought it back...

44:56.815 --> 45:00.683
Here... it is. But wait,
that's not the point.

45:00.736 --> 45:04.188
This might seem out of the
blue, this is out of the blue,

45:04.240 --> 45:09.661
actually, but, prom is coming up, as you
know, and I am looking for a date,

45:09.704 --> 45:12.575
and I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go with me.

45:14.042 --> 45:15.205
Are you serious?

45:15.252 --> 45:16.628
Well, I know it's
a little last minute,

45:16.670 --> 45:18.497
but I'm really fun, I swear.

45:18.547 --> 45:20.955
- You know, I have references...
- No, it's not that.

45:21.009 --> 45:24.093
I have a boyfriend.
Didn't you know that?

45:24.137 --> 45:27.008
Oh. No, I guess not.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.216
I thought everyone
knew about us.

45:29.268 --> 45:33.811
I'm Kristen, he's Anton.
We're Kranton.

45:36.693 --> 45:38.401
I mean, how could you
not know about us?

45:38.445 --> 45:41.280
- You'd have to live in a cave.
- I don't.

45:41.323 --> 45:45.570
Yeah, I mean, we're always together
and the five minutes I'm talking to you

45:45.619 --> 45:47.493
have been the longest
we've been apart in months.

45:47.538 --> 45:50.539
- Huh.
- Yeah. You're back.

45:50.583 --> 45:51.781
God, I missed you.

45:53.795 --> 45:55.289
Anton.

45:55.338 --> 45:59.835
OK, I'll just... slip it in.

45:59.885 --> 46:01.629
Just slip it in there.

46:01.679 --> 46:04.514
Just... Right in front of me. OK.

46:04.557 --> 46:07.262
Well, talk to ya later then,
"Kranton."

46:11.482 --> 46:12.857
...and she called him.

46:12.900 --> 46:15.854
- Hey, Simone.
- Hey.

46:15.903 --> 46:18.394
Listen, if you wanna study
for the elements test after school...

46:18.448 --> 46:20.405
I'd love to. I really need it.

46:20.450 --> 46:22.075
Cool. How about
we meet in the library?

46:22.118 --> 46:24.526
Perfect. I'll be there.

46:24.579 --> 46:27.783
Hey, I thought
we were gonna study.

46:27.833 --> 46:30.751
Dude, I'm sealing the deal.

46:30.795 --> 46:34.959
OK, yeah. I'll just study by myself.
That's much more efficient.

46:35.008 --> 46:36.336
Cool.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.833
You must've worked all night.

47:10.422 --> 47:12.462
It's...

47:15.428 --> 47:17.171
...inspired.

47:20.350 --> 47:24.218
I have a kid brother. He's seven.

47:25.940 --> 47:30.401
And because of my mom's work schedule,
I have to pick him up from school.

47:30.445 --> 47:32.651
Why are you telling me this?

47:32.697 --> 47:36.363
It's why I cut class
and I'm late getting here.

47:38.287 --> 47:42.451
I just want you to know, I'm not blowing
it off 'cause I'm a slacker.

47:50.634 --> 47:51.665
From now on...

47:53.053 --> 47:54.845
...we start at 3.15.

48:12.158 --> 48:15.408
Hi, Simone.
Welcome to the library.

48:17.497 --> 48:19.537
Hey, Simone, you ready to study?

48:21.877 --> 48:23.537
Hey, Simone, didn't see you there.

48:23.587 --> 48:25.829
What am I saying?
Of course I saw her.

48:32.097 --> 48:33.508
Hey.

48:33.557 --> 48:35.135
What do you want?

48:35.184 --> 48:36.678
Can I give you a ride home?

48:36.727 --> 48:38.435
I have plans.

48:39.438 --> 48:41.727
Listen, I really
need to talk, Simone.

48:41.774 --> 48:44.859
All right, there aren't a lot
of people I can do that with.

48:44.903 --> 48:46.730
Just a few minutes?

49:04.925 --> 49:08.626
- Why won't you answer my texts?
- You know why.

49:08.679 --> 49:10.802
I mean, you said it was over
between you and Jordan.

49:10.848 --> 49:12.426
I never would've gone out with you.

49:12.475 --> 49:15.311
Please don't ice me out
like this, Simone.

49:15.353 --> 49:19.054
I know it's messed up about Jordan,
but we've been together for a long time.

49:19.108 --> 49:21.646
OK, she's been talking
about prom for years.

49:21.694 --> 49:24.814
- But, Tyler, this isn't...
- You're such a special girl.

49:26.282 --> 49:29.367
If you weren't, I would
never expect you to understand.

49:29.411 --> 49:32.116
Just give me until after prom.

49:36.252 --> 49:37.497
You're missing my...

50:33.732 --> 50:35.772
Unbelievable.

50:38.905 --> 50:39.936
What?

50:39.989 --> 50:43.275
Archfield's prom is this weekend,
and Ali just found out that their theme

50:43.327 --> 50:48.238
- is "Starry, Starry Night."
- They have an extra "Starry."

50:48.290 --> 50:51.457
- So?
- It's gonna sound really stupid.

50:53.338 --> 50:57.632
I just thought that we were
creating this one-of-a-kind night,

50:57.676 --> 51:01.295
and turns out there's another
one a couple miles away.

51:01.347 --> 51:05.096
Just makes it feel so... ordinary.

51:07.478 --> 51:10.433
Well, maybe we should check out
how starry their night really is.

51:19.450 --> 51:21.277
You can do it, Nova.

51:21.327 --> 51:22.952
Do what?

51:22.996 --> 51:24.989
Trust me.

52:04.292 --> 52:05.703
Great.

52:07.587 --> 52:10.079
So, how are you
gonna get us in there?

52:12.134 --> 52:15.503
I'm gonna fire my grappling
hook gun, climb onto the roof,

52:15.554 --> 52:17.843
and crash in through the skylight.

52:17.890 --> 52:19.848
Really?

52:21.102 --> 52:23.179
No.

52:27.318 --> 52:28.349
Good thinking.

52:41.166 --> 52:44.452
Oh, man. This is pathetic.

52:44.503 --> 52:47.458
These totally come in a kit.

52:48.508 --> 52:51.462
That's lame.
And a balloon wall, really?

52:52.846 --> 52:55.468
These lights don't even twinkle.

52:55.516 --> 52:57.924
And where's the cosmic canopy?

52:57.977 --> 53:00.550
Complete amateurs.

53:04.526 --> 53:06.732
Why are you doing this?

53:06.778 --> 53:09.566
Well, I hadn't broken in
anywhere in a while, and I thought...

53:09.615 --> 53:11.442
I'm serious.

53:13.327 --> 53:18.619
You don't care about prom.
So... why help me?

53:21.670 --> 53:25.086
It's nice to be around someone
who believes in something so much.

53:37.229 --> 53:38.260
What are you doing?

53:38.313 --> 53:39.309
What do you mean?

53:39.356 --> 53:40.601
You were gonna kiss me.

53:40.649 --> 53:42.523
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, why not?

53:42.568 --> 53:43.813
What?

53:45.572 --> 53:50.234
Nova. If I'm about to kiss you,
you'll know it.

53:52.788 --> 53:53.986
What was that?

53:54.039 --> 53:55.582
Hey! Who's there?

53:55.624 --> 53:57.498
We gotta go.

54:19.568 --> 54:21.027
Nova, this way.

54:28.161 --> 54:31.162
- Black and white?
- Come on!

54:35.544 --> 54:36.825
We did it!

54:46.932 --> 54:48.925
I have a record now.

54:48.976 --> 54:51.811
A rap sheet. I have "priors".

54:51.854 --> 54:53.930
You don't have "priors".

54:53.981 --> 54:56.021
A stern warning
and a call to your parents

54:56.067 --> 54:57.645
isn't exactly your "first strike".

54:57.694 --> 54:59.687
What if they tell Georgetown?

54:59.738 --> 55:01.612
Nova, it's fine. They're not...

55:01.656 --> 55:03.530
- You! Hey, you!
- Dad...

55:03.575 --> 55:05.485
- What'd you do to her?
- It's OK.

55:05.536 --> 55:07.944
- OK? What are you, out of your mind?
- He was doing all this for me.

55:07.997 --> 55:09.657
What? Breaking into a school?
Getting stopped by the cops?

55:09.707 --> 55:11.949
Please listen to me.
I deserve the blame, OK?

55:12.001 --> 55:13.246
Really? Whose idea was it?

55:13.294 --> 55:16.415
- Dad, Archfield had the same exact...
- You're right. It was my idea.

55:20.845 --> 55:23.762
This isn't you, Nova. Let's go.

55:26.643 --> 55:28.517
Kid's a loser.

55:48.709 --> 55:49.824
Hi.

55:50.753 --> 55:52.164
Hey.

55:54.924 --> 55:57.629
- Tyler.
- Hey, babe.

55:57.677 --> 56:01.722
It's over.
I know about your sophomore.

56:01.765 --> 56:04.969
I'm really sorry I didn't
make it to the library.

56:05.478 --> 56:07.850
The library! I totally forgot.

56:07.897 --> 56:09.973
Really?

56:10.024 --> 56:14.604
- I gave a girl a ride home.
- This isn't about her. It's about you.

56:14.655 --> 56:18.569
I was out with the team. Tyler wanted to
show me some moves. Varsity stuff.

56:18.617 --> 56:20.906
I'm looking good
for next year, so...

56:20.953 --> 56:22.863
Tyler showed you.

56:22.914 --> 56:26.497
Yeah. We must've lost track of time
and forgot about our plans.

56:28.629 --> 56:32.627
- What are you so upset about?
- I'm not upset. I'm done.

56:33.843 --> 56:36.299
Well, I'm still really sorry.

56:36.345 --> 56:38.919
I would've hated waiting all afternoon
for someone to show up.

56:38.973 --> 56:42.639
Yeah. That would've sucked.

56:44.563 --> 56:48.015
Prom's right around the corner.
What are you gonna do, not go?

56:48.067 --> 56:50.274
Don't worry about me, Tyler.

56:50.319 --> 56:54.020
You just keep worrying about you,
since that's what you're best at.

57:07.964 --> 57:11.333
Out of the whole collection,
these two are my favourites.

57:13.679 --> 57:16.217
This Harvey Kuenn's worth,
like, 40 bucks,

57:16.265 --> 57:19.681
and this Al Kaline
would go for 80 at least.

57:19.727 --> 57:21.850
You must have some allowance, kid.

57:21.896 --> 57:24.185
My dad left them behind.

57:25.984 --> 57:29.270
Charlie. Why are you
carrying those around?

57:30.823 --> 57:32.104
They stay in the basement.

57:35.787 --> 57:37.067
What are you doing here?

57:37.122 --> 57:42.496
The way my dad talked to you,
you didn't deserve that.

57:42.544 --> 57:45.036
And the way Dunnan treats you...

57:45.089 --> 57:48.423
A lot of people are wrong about you.

57:49.969 --> 57:52.543
And... I was one of 'em.

57:54.725 --> 57:56.634
You came all the way here
to tell me that?

57:58.687 --> 58:01.558
I even ditched last period.

58:04.027 --> 58:05.936
For her, that's a big deal.

58:07.447 --> 58:10.199
What are you,
his peer counsellor or something?

58:10.242 --> 58:14.287
Hey! Talking about? Peer counsellor!

58:17.250 --> 58:18.530
Can I at least
just see it on you?

58:18.585 --> 58:20.827
No! I look like a manatee.

58:20.879 --> 58:22.421
No one will ever
see this dress on me.

58:22.464 --> 58:25.086
Cut is wrong, the colour is
wrong, the fabric is wrong.

58:25.134 --> 58:26.379
Everything is wrong!

58:26.427 --> 58:28.799
No, don't! Mei...
Now what are you gonna wear?

58:28.846 --> 58:31.598
I don't know! Nothing.

58:35.312 --> 58:36.426
What is this about?

58:37.689 --> 58:40.607
I know you.
It's not about a dress.

58:41.986 --> 58:44.275
Look, if you don't want to go to
prom, just let me know.

58:45.448 --> 58:47.026
What are you talking about?

58:47.075 --> 58:48.984
Well, first it was the limo.
Now the dress.

58:49.035 --> 58:52.535
You're obviously looking
for excuses not to go.

58:52.581 --> 58:54.372
- I never said that.
- You don't have to.

58:54.416 --> 58:56.658
I know when I'm being blown off.

58:56.710 --> 59:00.625
You don't wanna go? Fine.

59:00.673 --> 59:03.509
Prom's off. Problem solved.

59:15.982 --> 59:18.058
Good bye, Tyler.

59:46.224 --> 59:48.347
Hey, Jordan,
I was thinking. Are you?

59:50.103 --> 59:51.302
Whoa.

59:54.191 --> 59:56.184
I like it better that way.

59:58.696 --> 01:00:00.239
Me, too.

01:00:04.036 --> 01:00:06.788
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.666
So, you say you two have been
working together at school?

01:00:11.419 --> 01:00:13.542
Something like that.

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.625
Can I get a refill
before I barf, please?

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:25.390
My favourite kind of customers.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.928
Waitress! Cleanup on aisle five.

01:00:29.981 --> 01:00:31.641
You gonna clean that up?

01:00:34.445 --> 01:00:36.105
- I think we should go.
- Are you gonna clean that up?

01:00:36.155 --> 01:00:38.776
- Do you hear something?
- Nah, I don't see anything either.

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:42.530
I want you to come with me.

01:00:45.123 --> 01:00:48.706
Jesse... You can do it.

01:00:48.752 --> 01:00:52.501
- Do what?
- Trust me.

01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:06.220
Those idiots aren't worth it. Come on.

01:01:06.272 --> 01:01:08.561
They'll get what's coming
to 'em. Stuff balances out.

01:01:08.608 --> 01:01:11.692
- Wake up, Nova.
- What does that mean?

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:13.017
It means it's easy
to believe in that stuff

01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:14.530
when everything
always goes your way.

01:01:14.573 --> 01:01:17.693
You think that
everything goes my way?

01:01:17.743 --> 01:01:21.658
That I have no problems
in my life because my dad didn't leave?

01:01:21.706 --> 01:01:24.458
You think sometimes I don't
wanna just forget everything,

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.410
get on my motorcycle all angry

01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:28.952
and misunderstood
and go beat some people up?

01:01:29.005 --> 01:01:33.502
I have to work my butt off
just to try to get things to go my way.

01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:37.134
Everybody does.

01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:44.017
What?

01:01:44.064 --> 01:01:46.472
I bet you could
beat some people up.

01:01:47.443 --> 01:01:49.020
Yeah, I could.

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:53.649
OK. Let's go dress shopping.

01:01:55.452 --> 01:01:56.566
What?

01:03:11.453 --> 01:03:15.119
So, how come you don't
have a date?

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.491
He bailed on me.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.378
Well, there must be somebody
else you could go with.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:24.749
Like the class president
or something?

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.341
I am the class president.

01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:32.718
Come on. There must be some honour
student out there who you could go...

01:03:46.033 --> 01:03:47.991
Really?

01:03:50.038 --> 01:03:53.407
That looks fantastic with
our garnet pendant necklace.

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:56.210
Necklace?
With the price of this dress,

01:03:56.253 --> 01:03:59.705
the only necklace I'll be able to
afford'll be made out of candy.

01:04:07.224 --> 01:04:09.929
That guy who ditched you
made a big mistake.

01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:31.582
This is awful. You've been dissed,
trampled, humiliated, stomped on.

01:04:31.626 --> 01:04:33.749
Your heart's just been, like,
torn out and ground up in...

01:04:33.795 --> 01:04:35.337
I get it! OK?

01:04:36.965 --> 01:04:38.673
What's that?

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:44.889
Hey, Simone. You didn't happen to see
anybody put this in my locker, did you?

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:47.305
Why? What is it?

01:04:48.561 --> 01:04:51.646
Tickets.
To see Mechanical Sandwich?

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.517
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They had an interesting single,

01:04:53.567 --> 01:04:55.524
but then they changed bass
players on the second album

01:04:55.569 --> 01:04:57.064
and totally ended up sucking.

01:04:57.113 --> 01:04:59.105
Yeah. Their second album
was pretty lame.

01:04:59.157 --> 01:05:00.984
I don't even know why
Stick Hippo's opening for them.

01:05:01.034 --> 01:05:02.113
- What?!
- What?!

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.738
Hold on. How do you
know about this? I mean,

01:05:03.787 --> 01:05:06.990
I'm a certified Stick Hippo webmaster,
and even I didn't know about this.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.535
Well, it's kind of a secret gig.

01:05:08.584 --> 01:05:11.918
I got the last two tickets.
Oh, I like your site, by the way.

01:05:11.963 --> 01:05:16.921
You're the one hit.
Dude, she's the one hit!

01:05:16.968 --> 01:05:20.836
Wait. That means
my mom's been lying to me.

01:05:22.808 --> 01:05:26.308
- I bet they're great live.
- Are you kidding? They're the best!

01:05:26.354 --> 01:05:29.023
Where are our seats?

01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:38.031
This is like
a "you guys" thing. OK.

01:05:38.075 --> 01:05:39.783
Just get me a T-shirt
or something.

01:05:39.827 --> 01:05:41.452
Definitely.

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:49.457
Do all assigned books have
to be so torturously boring?

01:05:51.465 --> 01:05:54.003
Oh, yeah. This is rough.
<i>Ethan Frome?</i>

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:57.337
The worst! The guy falls in love
with his wife's cousin,

01:05:57.388 --> 01:06:00.758
goes sledding with her,
she winds up paralysed. Snore.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:04.016
That is an incredibly
accurate plot summary.

01:06:09.193 --> 01:06:13.737
Hey, listen. You don't happen
to have a date to prom, do you?

01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:15.192
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:17.530
I mean, I know it's
a crazy thing to just ask...

01:06:17.577 --> 01:06:22.121
No. It's sweet. I don't think we've ever
talked before, have we?

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:24.455
Maybe not. I'm Lloyd.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:26.910
- Betsy.
- Short for Elizabeth?

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:29.668
- That's right.
- Pretty.

01:06:29.716 --> 01:06:31.625
Thanks.

01:06:33.303 --> 01:06:35.925
So, what do you say, Bets? Prom?

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:39.677
Well, it could be fun. You seem nice.

01:06:39.727 --> 01:06:42.645
But I have a date already.

01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:47.684
I mean, we're just friends, we're going
as friends, but, prom's Saturday.

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:49.444
I can't cancel now.

01:06:49.488 --> 01:06:52.489
Yeah, no, I underst... Yeah.

01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:56.531
It's too bad. If only we'd
met sooner, you know?

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:00.030
Yeah.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:03.084
Isn't it funny how you can go to school
with somebody for so long

01:07:03.128 --> 01:07:05.833
and not even meet them till now?

01:07:05.881 --> 01:07:08.966
Yeah. Funny.

01:07:15.475 --> 01:07:18.145
Like sledding
and getting paralysed.

01:08:02.528 --> 01:08:03.726
What are you doing?

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:06.734
Can't a guy ask a girl to prom?

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:08.989
I thought you
were taking Jordan.

01:08:09.035 --> 01:08:10.613
It's over.

01:08:12.205 --> 01:08:14.245
I ended it for real.

01:08:16.085 --> 01:08:17.081
Tyler...

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.326
I mean, if you want to think
about it,

01:08:18.379 --> 01:08:20.917
you can just bring
your answer to school tomorrow.

01:08:23.926 --> 01:08:24.957
And...

01:08:28.557 --> 01:08:30.301
I got this for you, too.

01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:37.104
I'd love to hear
you play sometime.

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:01.301
Rolo. Wow.

01:09:01.343 --> 01:09:03.252
That's a good look for you.

01:09:03.304 --> 01:09:05.841
How do I know which one to pick?

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:08.381
Well, do you know
what Athena's wearing?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.428
Yeah. This.

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:14.732
Nice try.

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:16.270
What do you mean?

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.354
You'd have to be a Victoria's Secret
model to pull this off.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.482
Well, that's what she's wearing.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.572
What magazine did you
rip this out of?

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.947
Oh, no, no, no.
She sent it to me.

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:26.537
In the mail, of course.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.497
Because her e-mail privileges,
they were revoked when

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:31.581
- she stayed out clubbing.
- Clubbing.

01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:35.045
Exactly.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:39.752
All right, Rolo.
I guess I'll see you guys at prom.

01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:41.131
Cool.

01:09:44.308 --> 01:09:45.719
Wonder if they'll be too high?

01:09:45.768 --> 01:09:50.265
- I don't want to be taller than him.
- Taller than who?

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:52.557
You got a prom date, and this is the
first we're hearing about it?

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:55.729
He hasn't asked me yet, but...

01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:59.908
...tomorrow's our last day working
together, and I think he's going to.

01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:02.868
Is she talking about Jesse Richter?
Are you talking about Jesse Richter?

01:10:04.164 --> 01:10:06.785
Wow! Nova likes bad boys.

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:09.206
- Who knew?
- You rebel!

01:10:09.253 --> 01:10:12.420
It's more than that.
I've never felt like this before.

01:10:14.342 --> 01:10:16.880
You and Jesse Richter.
I don't believe it.

01:10:16.928 --> 01:10:19.597
- Yeah, no one will.
- Why not?

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.969
Because you're you, and he's...

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:24.093
And he's not exactly Brandon.

01:10:24.144 --> 01:10:25.639
He's kind of on the other side
of the planet from Brandon.

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:26.387
Yeah.

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:30.602
Well, maybe that stuff isn't
as important as I thought it was.

01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:34.981
Maybe there's more to a person than
being valedictorian or class president.

01:10:40.246 --> 01:10:41.823
So sweet!

01:10:53.177 --> 01:10:54.968
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:03.438 --> 01:11:04.387
Hey, Jesse.

01:11:08.402 --> 01:11:10.893
- Hey.
- I'm here about Nova.

01:11:10.946 --> 01:11:13.189
Is she all right?

01:11:13.241 --> 01:11:14.355
Yeah, she's fine.

01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:18.074
In fact, she's,
she's better than fine.

01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:21.870
Top of her class,
full scholarship next year.

01:11:23.085 --> 01:11:24.460
Big plans.

01:11:25.588 --> 01:11:26.667
I know.

01:11:26.714 --> 01:11:29.834
OK. You know.

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:34.013
But maybe you don't know how much work
she's done to get where she is.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:36.179
She's in the home stretch now.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:39.143
And that's where you came in.

01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:41.725
Right at the end.

01:11:41.773 --> 01:11:43.600
You don't even know me.

01:11:45.318 --> 01:11:47.774
No, I... I do know you.

01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:50.573
Come on. I was just like you.

01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:53.107
Struggling to get by,
angry at the world.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.612
You know, no plans for the future.

01:11:56.664 --> 01:11:58.990
And you might even figure it out.

01:12:00.752 --> 01:12:04.453
But it's not fair to drag
Nova down while you do.

01:12:07.468 --> 01:12:11.680
So, if you care about her
as much as I think you do...

01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:16.102
...you won't be the thing
that holds her back.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.076
OK, so the President of
the United States comes to you,

01:12:39.128 --> 01:12:42.829
says that we need a new national anthem,
any band, any era, right?

01:12:42.882 --> 01:12:45.670
There's, there's Simone.
I'll catch you later.

01:12:47.805 --> 01:12:49.844
- Hey, Simone.
- All right.

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.049
Hey, Lucas.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.936
So, on Saturday, what do
you think? Pick you up at six?

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:58.099
Actually, I've been looking for you.

01:12:59.526 --> 01:13:01.733
Because Saturday's prom,

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:04.614
and do you remember
that guy I told you about

01:13:04.657 --> 01:13:08.240
who wasn't available?
Well, he asked me.

01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:10.492
And we're going.

01:13:14.084 --> 01:13:16.326
I didn't mean to mess up your
plans. It all happened so fast.

01:13:16.378 --> 01:13:19.913
No. I'm happy for you.

01:13:23.886 --> 01:13:25.844
I'm really sorry, Lucas.

01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:29.931
- Let's go. I'm starving. Huh?
- Go.

01:13:29.977 --> 01:13:31.637
You guys are going for pizza?

01:13:31.687 --> 01:13:34.309
You're the man, Luke!

01:13:59.259 --> 01:14:00.504
Hey.

01:14:00.552 --> 01:14:02.296
Hey.

01:14:02.346 --> 01:14:05.347
So, I was thinking we should check
the speed of the disco ball,

01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:07.764
make sure it's not too fast or...

01:14:08.895 --> 01:14:10.852
OK. Great.

01:14:18.906 --> 01:14:21.444
That looks good. Right?

01:14:21.492 --> 01:14:24.280
Or is that too slow?
Is it too slow?

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:25.574
Nova, just tell me how you want it.

01:14:25.622 --> 01:14:27.247
Well, don't you have an opinion?

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:29.864
My opinion is I wanna set this
thing and be done with it.

01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:34.248
That's fine, then.

01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:38.212
I can't wait until
you turn on that fountain

01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:40.171
under these lights tomorrow night.

01:14:40.222 --> 01:14:43.176
- Me?
- Well, who else?

01:14:43.225 --> 01:14:44.767
I won't be here.

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:48.648
You didn't think I was actually gonna go
to this thing, did you?

01:14:52.902 --> 01:14:54.017
Yeah.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:57.440
I've wasted enough of my time on prom.

01:14:57.491 --> 01:15:02.367
I don't think it was
a waste of time... for us.

01:15:02.413 --> 01:15:04.157
What "us"?

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:08.959
You expect me to believe that this
hasn't meant anything to you?

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:11.460
That you don't feel any different?

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.176
How I feel or how you feel
doesn't mean anything.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.716
What?

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:20.136
Your world may be all disco
balls and celestial fountains,

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:21.725
but that's not where I live.

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:24.639
Where I live, I'm a bad guy
who's going nowhere,

01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:26.063
and that's the only reason I'm here.

01:15:27.232 --> 01:15:29.356
None of that stuff matters.

01:15:29.402 --> 01:15:32.272
As long as you feel
the same way about me as...

01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:35.823
...I feel about you.

01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:40.949
I don't.

01:16:15.703 --> 01:16:19.120
OK. So, just to be clear,
that is a "no."

01:16:19.165 --> 01:16:20.874
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:16:22.169 --> 01:16:23.829
I know the feeling.

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:28.083
What's her name?

01:16:29.469 --> 01:16:31.343
Simone.

01:16:34.099 --> 01:16:35.474
Simone.

01:16:37.394 --> 01:16:42.057
I didn't ask her. What happened?

01:16:43.442 --> 01:16:46.278
She's going to prom.

01:16:46.321 --> 01:16:49.275
Shoulda known. Prom.

01:16:49.324 --> 01:16:51.400
That soul-crushing mistress.

01:16:52.786 --> 01:16:57.283
Yeah, well, she's going and now
she'll never know how I feel.

01:17:00.795 --> 01:17:02.254
You gotta tell her.

01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:07.796
- You don't even know me.
- Don't I?

01:17:07.845 --> 01:17:12.591
Shy, nice guy, always waiting for the
right time to make his move,

01:17:12.642 --> 01:17:14.884
and the right time never comes?

01:17:14.936 --> 01:17:16.514
Before you know it, you're a senior,

01:17:16.563 --> 01:17:20.893
couple weeks from graduating,
and... you saw.

01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:24.852
You can't keep waiting
for the right moment to happen.

01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:28.773
Make it happen.
What do you have to lose?

01:17:48.056 --> 01:17:50.844
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:50.893 --> 01:17:53.218
I have to tell you something.

01:18:08.537 --> 01:18:10.744
I got accepted to Parsons.

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:13.992
For design.

01:18:14.878 --> 01:18:15.957
In New York.

01:18:19.883 --> 01:18:21.378
New York.

01:18:24.138 --> 01:18:26.214
I didn't even know you applied.

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:29.018
I didn't think I'd get in.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.264
And I was wait-listed
and I thought "no way."

01:18:33.148 --> 01:18:34.808
And then I got in.

01:18:39.697 --> 01:18:43.565
Justin... I'm gonna go.

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.916
Say something.

01:18:53.713 --> 01:18:56.287
How could you think
I wouldn't be proud of you?

01:19:01.346 --> 01:19:05.131
This is why you've been acting
so crazy about prom.

01:19:08.771 --> 01:19:12.472
Prom is supposed to
be this "forever" night.

01:19:12.526 --> 01:19:17.983
And we're supposed to be
this..."forever" couple.

01:19:21.285 --> 01:19:22.945
Yeah.

01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:33.339
You know,
nobody knows the future.

01:19:36.761 --> 01:19:39.299
But I do know
how I feel about you.

01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:46.268
And what if
that's not enough?

01:19:46.313 --> 01:19:50.810
Mei, look at me. It's enough.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.868
- Do you think...
- What?

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:09.002
Anyone would notice if I wore
my homecoming dress?

01:20:11.383 --> 01:20:13.043
Who cares?

01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:45.666
Dude, get off me! Shut up. Idiot.

01:20:45.713 --> 01:20:47.753
Hey. See me now?

01:20:53.346 --> 01:20:56.965
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get outta here! Stop it!

01:20:57.017 --> 01:20:59.259
- Break it up!
- Get off of him!

01:20:59.687 --> 01:21:00.600
Move it!

01:21:01.522 --> 01:21:05.770
Let me see you. You OK?
Are you all right?

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:07.646
God, look at you.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.735
Look at you.

01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:12.948
Come on. Come get inside.

01:23:02.908 --> 01:23:05.909
OK, ready? OK.

01:23:05.953 --> 01:23:08.907
Do we really have to do the whole
picture-by-the-fireplace thing?

01:23:08.956 --> 01:23:10.119
Come on.
It's gonna be great.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:12.123
Why?

01:23:12.168 --> 01:23:17.245
Because the balloons are right
and the tablecloths match the napkins?

01:23:17.299 --> 01:23:20.715
Lots of people go to prom
without dates.

01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.006
This is about someone
in particular, isn't it?

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:32.603
I know it didn't make sense.
It just...

01:23:35.194 --> 01:23:37.815
...it just felt right.

01:23:38.656 --> 01:23:40.530
Why can't I have that?

01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:42.993
What did I do wrong?

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.951
I had a talk with him.

01:23:51.837 --> 01:23:54.079
You did what?

01:23:55.925 --> 01:23:58.761
I was protecting what we always
talked about for you.

01:24:00.096 --> 01:24:02.552
You've worked so hard.
I didn't want him to...

01:24:02.599 --> 01:24:05.719
...ruin all the great things
you had ahead of you.

01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:12.354
I know you think you were doing
what's best for me...

01:24:13.778 --> 01:24:16.863
...but tonight could've been
one of those great things.

01:24:20.035 --> 01:24:22.990
And he's not the one who ruined it.

01:24:50.528 --> 01:24:51.856
Sorry.

01:24:51.904 --> 01:24:53.696
What are you doing?

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.531
I meant to hit the window.

01:24:55.575 --> 01:24:57.651
Why are you in the tree?

01:24:57.702 --> 01:24:59.909
I have to tell you something.

01:24:59.955 --> 01:25:02.992
- Lucas, my date's gonna be...
- Don't go to prom.

01:25:04.668 --> 01:25:06.542
You're not seriously
asking me that.

01:25:07.505 --> 01:25:09.213
I love you...

01:25:10.133 --> 01:25:12.126
...as more than a friend.

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:15.546
Love implies more than a friend.

01:25:15.597 --> 01:25:19.761
Yes. It does, and I've missed every
chance to tell you until now

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:22.266
because I was stupid and scared.

01:25:23.356 --> 01:25:25.432
But now I'm in this tree,

01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:27.523
and you're so beautiful.

01:25:29.696 --> 01:25:32.698
And if you walk out that door,
I might as well stay up here forever.

01:25:34.201 --> 01:25:35.993
Don't go.

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:53.304
Tyler? You're going to prom with Tyler?

01:25:54.557 --> 01:25:56.385
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:26:00.356 --> 01:26:05.148
I'm sorry, Lucas. I have to go.

01:26:51.287 --> 01:26:54.573
Yo, Tyler! How's it goin', man?

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:56.368
What's up, baby?

01:26:56.418 --> 01:27:00.203
Chillin'. Chillin'.
Lookin' fresh, lookin' fresh.

01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:04.254
Hey, let's get together. Let's do this
picture thing real quick. Come on.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:05.547
Cheese!

01:27:26.994 --> 01:27:30.114
Nova! Hi.

01:27:30.164 --> 01:27:34.114
Brandon!
What are you doing here?

01:27:34.169 --> 01:27:37.752
Well, I made it back early.
You did it, Nova Prescott.

01:27:37.798 --> 01:27:42.010
Starry Night. I mean, it's all
that you said it would be.

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:45.468
Yeah.

01:27:45.515 --> 01:27:47.804
Everything's OK, right?

01:27:49.436 --> 01:27:52.472
No. It's not.

01:28:00.823 --> 01:28:02.199
She came by herself.

01:28:05.203 --> 01:28:06.698
Jordan?

01:28:08.373 --> 01:28:10.034
Wow. I can't believe it.

01:28:29.564 --> 01:28:31.770
You know, the first time I met
him, he'd just been in a fight.

01:28:31.816 --> 01:28:34.058
Yeah, like father like son.

01:28:34.111 --> 01:28:36.816
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, Mom.

01:28:36.864 --> 01:28:41.193
You married a fighter and look where it
got us. Look where it's got me.

01:28:43.955 --> 01:28:45.200
I did not marry a fighter.

01:28:45.248 --> 01:28:48.783
I married an idiot that got into fights.
There's a difference.

01:28:48.835 --> 01:28:52.536
You are a fighter.
You've been through a lot

01:28:52.589 --> 01:28:54.962
and you're still here
taking care of this family.

01:28:55.968 --> 01:28:58.638
I'd bet on you every time.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.554
Not everybody feels that way.

01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:04.180
She does.

01:29:09.191 --> 01:29:11.979
You know, your dad never knew
what the hell was important.

01:29:12.028 --> 01:29:14.234
What was worth fighting for.

01:29:15.365 --> 01:29:17.524
If he did, he'd be here...

01:29:17.576 --> 01:29:20.245
...to see how great you turned out.

01:29:29.172 --> 01:29:32.672
Even if it fits,
you're still the bigger man.

01:29:45.315 --> 01:29:46.644
Hey.

01:29:47.776 --> 01:29:49.057
Hey.

01:29:52.281 --> 01:29:55.366
I was a jerk, Corey.

01:29:59.956 --> 01:30:01.866
And I'm sorry.

01:30:05.254 --> 01:30:08.540
The band... is back together.

01:30:08.591 --> 01:30:12.636
Hold on. Mom! Let's go!

01:30:12.679 --> 01:30:15.466
- Hippos forever!
- Oh, yeah!

01:30:15.515 --> 01:30:18.636
All right. Top five tragic
band breakups of all time. Go.

01:30:18.686 --> 01:30:20.144
Oasis. The Kinks.

01:30:49.887 --> 01:30:52.758
This is awesome!

01:30:56.728 --> 01:30:58.851
Go. Have fun.

01:30:58.897 --> 01:31:01.186
Really? You sure?

01:31:01.233 --> 01:31:05.148
Yes. Go. Enjoy your youth.

01:31:13.747 --> 01:31:14.778
Come on!

01:31:39.067 --> 01:31:41.689
I can't believe
she dumped Tyler and came alone.

01:31:41.737 --> 01:31:44.228
I know. It's awesome.

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:52.158
Hey. Where you been?

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:53.915
They're about to announce
king and queen.

01:31:53.959 --> 01:31:57.375
You didn't break up with Jordan
to be with me.

01:31:59.048 --> 01:32:00.625
She dumped you.

01:32:00.674 --> 01:32:03.213
Well, yeah. Technically. But...

01:32:03.261 --> 01:32:05.834
You know, Tyler, all you had
to do was tell the truth.

01:32:08.058 --> 01:32:10.549
Was that really so difficult...

01:32:10.602 --> 01:32:13.140
...to tell the truth
about how you felt?

01:32:14.982 --> 01:32:16.524
I mean...

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:30.405
Attention, attention!
We're about to crown the king and queen.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:33.293
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have tallied the votes

01:32:33.336 --> 01:32:36.752
and are proud to announce
Brookside's new prom king is...

01:32:40.177 --> 01:32:41.802
Tyler Barso!

01:32:45.308 --> 01:32:46.932
Yeah!

01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:53.270
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:32:53.316 --> 01:32:56.520
And what's a king without a queen?

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.646
In a landslide win...

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:02.823
Jordan Lundley!

01:33:19.137 --> 01:33:23.218
Please make room for the king
and queen's official dance.

01:33:23.267 --> 01:33:25.141
No. I'm not
gonna dance with him.

01:33:25.185 --> 01:33:28.436
One second. Are you sure?

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.894
OK.

01:33:31.943 --> 01:33:35.229
At the request of the queen,
she will be sitting this dance out.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.239
So, it'll just be the king's
dance. By order of the queen.

01:33:51.298 --> 01:33:53.006
OK.

01:34:01.935 --> 01:34:03.559
Shall we?

01:34:04.938 --> 01:34:08.888
Actually, Tyler, there... there's
somewhere else I have to be.

01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:30.120
Oh... my... God.

01:34:39.143 --> 01:34:40.222
Hey.

01:34:42.814 --> 01:34:44.522
Nice dress.

01:34:58.122 --> 01:35:00.792
You brought your sister to prom?

01:35:00.834 --> 01:35:05.046
Yeah, it's... I can explain.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.167
I think that rocks.

01:35:18.604 --> 01:35:20.312
Where have you been?

01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:28.322
Amazing. I mean,
that version of "War Craving"?

01:35:28.364 --> 01:35:30.073
The best!

01:35:41.379 --> 01:35:45.923
Hendrix. Woodstock.

01:35:58.273 --> 01:36:00.847
Come on. Let's dance.

01:36:01.818 --> 01:36:03.776
I think I'm prom'd out.

01:36:17.836 --> 01:36:19.081
Nova!

01:36:20.923 --> 01:36:24.008
The fountain stopped working.

01:36:24.052 --> 01:36:27.587
You guys can figure it out
or just leave it off.

01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:12.726
You're here.

01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:17.101
Will you go to prom with me?

01:37:19.238 --> 01:37:20.483
Yes.

01:37:38.677 --> 01:37:40.504
What?

01:37:40.554 --> 01:37:45.512
I thought you'd never wear
that sweaty symbol of conformity.

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.766
I thought about that,

01:37:47.812 --> 01:37:49.436
but then I realised...

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:52.941
...I kinda rock it.

01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:18.217
It's so romantic.

01:38:21.891 --> 01:38:26.388
<i>Prom, a night when nice</i>
<i>guys might not finish last.</i>

01:38:27.982 --> 01:38:30.473
<i>When friends might</i>
<i>completely surprise you.</i>

01:38:32.153 --> 01:38:34.442
<i>When the person you were</i>
<i>throughout high school</i>

01:38:34.489 --> 01:38:36.612
<i>could change in an instant.</i>

01:38:38.744 --> 01:38:40.820
<i>Maybe you find</i>
<i>what you're looking for.</i>

01:38:44.208 --> 01:38:47.577
<i>Or maybe you just</i>
<i>find yourself.</i>

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:52.967
<i>It's true, one night can</i>
<i>bring us all together.</i>

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.801
<i>But it's more than that,</i>

01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:58.216
<i>'cause when it ends...</i>

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:01.719
<i>... it's really just the beginning.</i>

01:39:05.065 --> 01:39:07.852
You're about to kiss me.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:40:07.200
