00:01.929 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:05.689
- Show the cleavage.
- Got it.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.360
I've been put in charge.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.580
What do we do, Wesley?

00:10.330 --> 00:11.939
Last night I lost one of my crew.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.550
- Should've been there.
- How soon can we go?

00:15.130 --> 00:17.160
Cordy's been sucked into Pylea.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.809
We're going in after her.

00:22.129 --> 00:25.039
The metaphysical laws
don't seem to apply here.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.410
- Cordelia?
- They made me ruler.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.379
- Your Majesty.
- The Groosalugg.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.369
- Krevlornswath?
- My mother.

00:34.130 --> 00:36.270
Strike quickly and true.
Then we can eat.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.939
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.920
Put their heads on sticks and display
them outside the princess' window.

00:44.929 --> 00:47.490
You will do what we say.

00:51.929 --> 00:53.119
Oh, no.

00:57.929 --> 01:01.439
Oh, God, please forgive me.
This is all my fault.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.849
Because I pardoned you,
and they wanted to teach me a lesson.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.099
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:12.730 --> 01:14.590
You didn't do anything.

01:16.930 --> 01:20.620
I don't like it here anymore.
I just want to go home.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.189
Oh, honey, I'm right there with you.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.129 --> 02:22.889
I know this is a bit of a shock,
but I can explain. Take it easy.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.789
Get it out of your system.
That's good.

02:26.330 --> 02:28.930
You'll have to breathe sometime.
Shut up!

02:29.330 --> 02:31.500
I don't have hands to cover my ears.

02:32.330 --> 02:34.580
- You're....
- So just please listen.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.830
My people, the fun-loving
Deathwok Clan...

02:37.729 --> 02:40.710
...cut off our heads, we go on
until you mutilate our bodies.

02:41.330 --> 02:45.050
They haven't gotten that far.
Backlog in the mutilation chamber.

02:45.530 --> 02:48.199
So if we move quickly and quietly....

02:49.729 --> 02:52.469
Princess, are you troubled?
We heard shrieking.

02:52.729 --> 02:54.479
Oh, the shrieking.

02:55.129 --> 02:57.729
It's the meditation
I do to help me focus...

02:58.129 --> 03:01.039
...on the great affairs of state
that I must manage.

03:06.530 --> 03:09.090
Remove the head from
our lady's presence.

03:10.129 --> 03:11.250
No, no, no, no!.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.870
I like the filthy head.

03:13.129 --> 03:16.500
That is....
I want to defile it more.

03:19.129 --> 03:22.780
I'll keep it to spit upon,
and when I grow tired of that...

03:23.330 --> 03:26.310
...I will make it a planter.

03:26.930 --> 03:30.189
A traitor planter, for all to see.

03:31.729 --> 03:33.060
Or maybe a candy dish.

03:35.330 --> 03:38.069
- You may leave.
- As you wish, noble mistress.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.860
I'm sorry about the spittle.
I just had to think fast.

03:46.129 --> 03:47.919
This is unsettling for me.

03:48.530 --> 03:52.530
I'm sure it must be.
And after all, I only lost my head!

03:53.330 --> 03:54.490
Technically, my body.

03:55.129 --> 03:57.379
I know this is a trying experience...

03:57.530 --> 04:01.389
...but I don't see how yelling at me
can help matters.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.289
Take me to the mutilation chamber.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.419
I have no idea where
the mutilation chamber might be.

04:08.930 --> 04:12.370
I'll sit here and die, then.
Find someone who knows!

04:13.129 --> 04:14.669
In what temper did you find her?

04:14.930 --> 04:17.319
- She appeared distressed, master.
- Good.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.279
We'll add more heads,
so she'll remember...

04:20.930 --> 04:23.139
...who's the master
and who's the servant.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.579
Her two friends who escaped,
send a hunting party after them.

04:28.129 --> 04:31.540
- Yes, lord.
- The one they call Angel, what is he?

04:32.329 --> 04:34.290
He took apart two of my soldiers.

04:34.730 --> 04:36.899
He is a Van-tal. A drinker of blood.

04:37.129 --> 04:40.959
He can only be killed by fire,
decapitation or wood through the heart.

04:41.930 --> 04:44.769
Perhaps all three, just to be sure.
Hunt him down.

04:45.529 --> 04:48.649
It shall be done.
I will bury my spear in his rump.

04:49.730 --> 04:53.240
Captain, his heart is
where a cow's is. Here.

04:54.529 --> 04:56.040
Disgusting.

04:57.529 --> 05:00.829
This Angel beast has saved a slave
her rightful beheading.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.589
He ignores our laws
and profanes our culture.

05:04.129 --> 05:08.029
He does worse. He brings hope to
the cows, for if one can be free...

05:08.930 --> 05:11.420
...hope arises that all can be free.

05:11.930 --> 05:14.000
Isn't that right, Markallo?

05:14.930 --> 05:18.649
My lord, as it was ordained,
our lives belong to you.

05:19.129 --> 05:22.709
They do. Yet we live in a time
where runaways become rebels.

05:23.329 --> 05:26.560
Where portals open to worlds where
the clergy have not decreed them.

05:27.529 --> 05:29.740
Even slaves supposedly loyal to me...

05:30.529 --> 05:32.779
...give the enemy drawings
to our sacred devices.

05:33.529 --> 05:36.579
- It is not true, master.
- Don't be alarmed, Markallo.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.779
You did me a favor. The cows need
to know what we can do to them...

05:41.930 --> 05:43.959
...any time we choose.

05:48.529 --> 05:50.040
Please clean that up.

05:54.529 --> 05:59.100
"And if one of thy slaves offend thee,
thou shalt smite him down.

06:01.730 --> 06:05.730
And if all of thy slaves offend thee,
thou shalt smite them down...

06:06.529 --> 06:08.319
...even unto the very last one."

06:10.490 --> 06:13.970
For the crime of collaboration
you are sentenced to death.

06:14.689 --> 06:17.639
We're not collaborators.
We're not even from around here.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.410
On my count of three.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.300
- I should've been quiet.
- I got a plan.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.100
- Thank God. What is it?
- One.

06:24.889 --> 06:29.279
We die painfully, you go to hell
and I spend eternity with Jesus.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.410
Two.

06:35.089 --> 06:36.000
Three.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.759
Imperial Guards!

06:48.290 --> 06:50.250
This is our chance to escape!

06:50.689 --> 06:53.290
There they are!
Kill the otherworlders!

06:53.970 --> 06:56.250
I've had about enough of this world.

07:23.689 --> 07:27.240
I found kalla berries.
They sweeten the oatmeal.

07:27.889 --> 07:32.000
Well, I call it oatmeal. It's actually
Crug grains and thistles...

07:32.689 --> 07:35.149
...but with enough Kalla berries....

07:36.290 --> 07:38.250
I hope the skins are comfortable.

07:38.689 --> 07:42.240
I seem to remember beds.
You could sleep for hours at a time.

07:42.889 --> 07:46.189
I slept. It was fine.

07:49.490 --> 07:50.610
What?

07:53.089 --> 07:54.279
Did I snore?

07:56.689 --> 07:58.649
I don't remember any snoring.

07:59.689 --> 08:00.949
Good.

08:01.490 --> 08:04.370
I remember caterwauling.

08:05.689 --> 08:06.560
Sorry.

08:06.889 --> 08:10.439
I don't mind. Sometimes it
just burbles up inside you...

08:11.089 --> 08:13.120
...and you have to bellow a little.

08:13.490 --> 08:17.810
Do it all the time.
No one's around to hear.

08:21.889 --> 08:24.870
You'll get better
with a little rest and care.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.709
- I don't think so.
- Why wouldn't you?

08:30.290 --> 08:32.149
You saw what I turned into.

08:35.090 --> 08:38.500
Back in L.A. it's bad,
but here it's....

08:41.090 --> 08:42.909
We all got our demons.

08:48.889 --> 08:51.659
Okay, so maybe you got a beast in you.

08:51.889 --> 08:56.600
I know what it's like to be squirrelly
and a freak, with no one to--

08:59.090 --> 09:03.299
Does it taste like oatmeal? I forget
how things are supposed to taste.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.419
- Tastes good.
- Tacos!

09:06.889 --> 09:09.769
Sorry. I didn't mean to holler at you.
I love tacos.

09:10.490 --> 09:14.769
- Do they still have them back....
- Home? They didn't outlaw tacos.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.320
No, of course not.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.570
I'm trying to make
an enchilada out of treebark.

09:21.289 --> 09:22.899
Bark enchiladas.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.830
How's that going?

09:26.690 --> 09:28.480
There's work to be done.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.250
Come in!

09:32.450 --> 09:34.340
What may thy lowly servant
do for thee?

09:34.850 --> 09:37.549
You're not lowly. Get up.
You're just like me.

09:38.450 --> 09:40.700
Like you?
The Light That Shines Upon the Land?

09:40.850 --> 09:42.080
Sure.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.950
Is that what they really call me?

09:46.250 --> 09:49.269
Anyway, you have served me
long and loyally...

09:49.850 --> 09:53.429
...these last two-and-a-half days.

09:54.649 --> 09:56.649
- I'm very fond of you, Lamara.
- Marelda.

09:57.049 --> 09:59.509
- I knew that.
- Of course. You know all.

10:00.049 --> 10:01.129
You must cut my tongue.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.659
No cutting. What is it
with you people and mutilation?

10:05.450 --> 10:09.419
- We don't have a lot of entertainment.
- Can you keep a secret, Geraldo?

10:11.450 --> 10:13.840
Take me to the mutilation chamber.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.700
- This cannot be done.
- Why not?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.919
You would bring shame to the kingdom.

10:19.850 --> 10:23.009
You cannot defile your holy self
by entering such a place.

10:30.049 --> 10:32.820
Okay. Take off your clothes.

10:38.649 --> 10:40.159
Can't do this in L.A.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.669
- Why not?
- I'll burst into flames.

10:46.450 --> 10:48.240
Part of the beast thing.

10:48.850 --> 10:51.309
So it's better for you here.

10:53.649 --> 10:56.039
Well, there's the sun.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.309
Also the thing inside that
wants to rip my friends apart.

11:12.850 --> 11:16.679
Krv Drpglr.

11:17.049 --> 11:20.070
I know these words.
They open up the portals.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.570
They're consonant representations...

11:23.649 --> 11:26.909
...of a mathematical
transfiguration formula.

11:27.850 --> 11:28.720
Obviously.

11:29.049 --> 11:33.720
I thought if you said them out loud
in order the quaking would....

11:34.450 --> 11:36.029
You mean opening a portal.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.990
It's how we got here
and how we'll get back.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.870
No. I tried for years and years...

11:43.450 --> 11:45.980
...until my tongue was swollen.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.590
- It doesn't work on this side.
- It does.

11:49.450 --> 11:52.960
A Drokken and a green warrior got
to L.A. from this end.

11:53.649 --> 11:58.000
Someone opened up the portals. Maybe
you did, you just don't know where.

11:58.450 --> 12:02.870
Me? I don't think so.
The priests have all the power here.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.139
I can't change. I won't change.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.289
Missed the heart, did I?

12:41.330 --> 12:44.700
Don't die! Please don't die!
Please don't die!

12:59.929 --> 13:04.350
- They came for you. Why?
- They know we'll rescue the princess.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.539
- From what?
- Mating with the Groosalugg.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.210
It will fulfill their prophecies
and consolidate their power.

13:11.929 --> 13:14.700
We don't want that to happen
any more than you do.

13:14.929 --> 13:17.879
You're right, we're on the same side.
Release them.

13:20.330 --> 13:24.830
Though their hands were tied and their
necks were bared, they fought with us.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.629
I'm ashamed.
We nearly cut your heads off.

13:31.129 --> 13:33.940
You were just doing your job.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.450
You are free to go.

13:40.730 --> 13:42.690
Five cheers for the otherworlders!

13:43.129 --> 13:46.149
Brave warriors! Brave warriors!
Brave warriors!

13:46.730 --> 13:50.139
- In this world you get five.
- First we find Angel.

13:50.929 --> 13:55.460
Last time he had a "Rip out your guts
now, ask questions later" look.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.049
What do you suggest?

13:58.730 --> 14:02.590
These guys got a cause worth
fighting for. Isn't that what we do?

14:04.129 --> 14:05.000
And Cordelia?

14:05.330 --> 14:08.590
To get her out of that castle,
we'll need a lot of muscle.

14:08.929 --> 14:12.019
Muscle could be handy
if we have to incapacitate Angel.

14:12.529 --> 14:15.970
Also, look at them.
They're no match for the Covenant.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.980
I don't want to leave them
to be killed.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.500
I do that enough.

14:28.730 --> 14:31.080
There you are. Good.

14:31.730 --> 14:32.600
Hi.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.919
- You heal fast.
- One of the pluses of being a beast.

14:38.929 --> 14:42.759
But you're not. When you were fighting
this time, you didn't change.

14:43.129 --> 14:45.940
- I was afraid.
- Of what?

14:47.330 --> 14:49.960
That if I did, I'd never get back.

14:52.129 --> 14:53.779
You're not a beast.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.629
We'll write that on your bones
once he tears you to pieces.

15:01.129 --> 15:04.179
I'll roll him into the Drokken gully
like the others.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.289
Wait. I need to talk him.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.029
Tell me about the princess.

15:15.529 --> 15:17.700
The cow-bitch who brought you
into our world?

15:18.529 --> 15:23.059
Call her that again,
I'll remove your face. Slowly.

15:25.730 --> 15:28.779
Once the Groosalugg mates with her,
she'll be put to death.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.440
Like we already did
with that traitor, Krevlornswath.

15:34.129 --> 15:35.039
You killed Lorne?

15:35.330 --> 15:37.470
We cut his head off
and mutilated his body.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.309
I have to go.

15:42.529 --> 15:45.159
- They'll kill you.
- One of my friends is already dead.

15:46.129 --> 15:48.340
But it's safe here.
Out there, it's....

15:49.730 --> 15:51.450
It's safe here with me.

15:54.529 --> 15:55.789
I'm sorry.

15:59.330 --> 16:03.299
They'll kill you, and you'll turn into
that beast. Maybe not in that order.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.919
- They're in trouble.
- But the beast.

16:05.929 --> 16:07.929
You don't want them
to see you that way.

16:08.330 --> 16:11.000
I'm not afraid of it
like everyone else.

16:18.169 --> 16:20.519
It's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.820
It's pretty dark in here.

16:30.210 --> 16:32.139
Let me just get used to it.

16:36.809 --> 16:38.980
- Oh, yuck!
- Ow! Hey!

16:39.809 --> 16:41.210
I'm sorry. Sorry.

16:41.610 --> 16:44.769
These people are crazy!
Anything look familiar?

16:45.210 --> 16:46.820
Get me closer.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.330
- Oh, God. Oh, no!
- What?

16:53.610 --> 16:56.309
- That looks like your suit.
- It is my suit.

16:56.610 --> 16:59.240
You think they have French viscose
in this hellhole?

17:00.210 --> 17:03.539
Why am I still alive?
Once they chop me up, it's over.

17:03.809 --> 17:07.108
I'm looking at pieces of myself.
Oh, it's over!

17:08.009 --> 17:10.400
Wait. Since when do I have five toes?

17:11.009 --> 17:12.589
Somebody's coming.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.848
- Do you mind if I hit him with you?
- Yes!

17:23.009 --> 17:25.259
- Your Highness?
- Groo, it's you.

17:25.410 --> 17:28.180
I've done something terrible.
I betrayed my vows.

17:29.009 --> 17:30.869
He was your friend.
I can't see you suffer.

17:31.410 --> 17:32.279
What?

17:33.210 --> 17:35.950
I stole his body
and put his garment on these parts.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.420
- To fool them.
- You did all this for me?

17:40.410 --> 17:42.900
That's not terrible,
that's wonderful!

17:44.609 --> 17:46.960
Feels like somebody works out.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.420
Hi. And thank you from the bottom
of my neck on down.

17:51.210 --> 17:54.470
- Where's my body?
- I smuggled it to your mother's farm.

17:55.410 --> 17:59.059
Your cousin Landok will meet us at
the watchtower and take you home.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.839
This is great!
The man's an honest-to-God hero.

18:04.410 --> 18:05.740
Watch the head!

18:06.490 --> 18:08.700
- Still want to storm the castle gates?
- Yes.

18:09.490 --> 18:12.400
We can't defeat them.
They have power and wealth.

18:12.490 --> 18:15.259
- Storm the gates.
- If you do, they'll cut you down.

18:16.089 --> 18:19.420
You can't wage a frontal attack
against a stronger opponent.

18:20.289 --> 18:23.380
This battle can only be won
through guerilla warfare.

18:25.690 --> 18:29.900
You create a diversion, then you
strike at several points at once.

18:30.490 --> 18:33.119
- Then you come from behind.
- And kill their leader.

18:34.089 --> 18:36.190
Silas, the head priest.
It's a good plan.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.930
I agree.

18:38.890 --> 18:42.259
- You shall lead us.
- Me? No. I was just suggesting--

18:43.089 --> 18:45.549
You fought well.
The Covenant hates you.

18:46.089 --> 18:48.619
And you have a plan.
Besides, our leader's dead.

18:49.089 --> 18:51.259
- Hail to our new leader!
- Hail!

18:52.089 --> 18:54.160
Why do people keep
putting me in charge?

18:54.490 --> 18:56.140
- I have no idea.
- Hail!

18:58.089 --> 18:59.559
How's it feel?

19:00.490 --> 19:02.140
All right.

19:02.890 --> 19:05.839
It's best if you don't
move it for a while.

19:07.089 --> 19:08.319
Well, I better....

19:08.890 --> 19:11.910
Help your friends. I know.

19:14.289 --> 19:15.660
You're a good man.

19:43.690 --> 19:45.789
- I don't know how to get there.
- Oh.

19:46.690 --> 19:48.160
I can show you.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.269
I disobeyed the Covenant.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.180
I shall spend eternity burning
in Tarkna for my sin.

19:56.650 --> 19:59.069
Who believes in literal
Tarkna nowadays?

19:59.650 --> 20:02.349
It was worth it for one moment
of your intimate touch.

20:02.650 --> 20:05.880
That was an accident.
It was kind of dark and....

20:06.849 --> 20:08.250
Oh, you mean the hug.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.430
When I hugged you.

20:13.450 --> 20:15.099
That was nice.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.549
Where were we?

20:17.049 --> 20:21.650
Oh, yeah. The nutcake clergy guys
need someone to disobey them.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.150
They're evil
and they run an evil regime.

20:26.049 --> 20:28.049
It's not my duty
to question authority.

20:28.450 --> 20:31.329
You're Groosalugg, the brave,
undefeated champion.

20:32.049 --> 20:34.440
If it's not your duty,
then I don't know what is.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.869
I fight who I am told.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.789
I am not a real champion.

20:41.650 --> 20:45.089
Then it's time you stopped working
for monk-boy and became one.

20:45.849 --> 20:50.309
What you did for me and my friend,
that was pure champ, all the way.

20:52.450 --> 20:54.380
I'm unworthy of lifting your burden.

20:54.849 --> 20:57.240
Nonsense. You're way worthy.

20:57.849 --> 21:01.009
- What burden is that again?
- When you receive me.

21:02.049 --> 21:05.240
- On the night we are wed.
- Receive? Oh.

21:06.250 --> 21:10.220
Receive. When I and you,
on the wedding night....

21:11.049 --> 21:13.720
I think there'll be
burden-lifting on both sides.

21:14.049 --> 21:16.079
Not that I have a lot of experience.

21:16.450 --> 21:19.890
It's in the prophecies.
One who's cursed with visions...

21:21.250 --> 21:25.150
...will mate with the Groosalugg,
whose demon blood shall absorb them.

21:26.049 --> 21:27.450
Absorb them?

21:27.849 --> 21:29.849
Your visions shall pass to me.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.500
I knew there was a catch!

21:38.049 --> 21:40.009
You can't take my visions.

21:40.450 --> 21:44.839
I need them. I use them to help
my friends fight evil back home.

21:45.849 --> 21:49.609
And I'll use them here to fight evil,
just as you have done.

21:50.049 --> 21:53.670
Groo, I can't give up my visions.

21:54.849 --> 21:56.009
I like them.

21:56.650 --> 22:01.150
Okay, I don't like the pain and agony
that's steadily getting worse--

22:02.049 --> 22:03.630
You are pure human.

22:03.849 --> 22:06.269
You are not meant to carry
such a burden.

22:08.049 --> 22:09.380
Maybe not.

22:09.849 --> 22:12.410
But I'm not ready
to give them up, either.

22:14.049 --> 22:16.609
They're a part of who I am now.
They're an honor.

22:17.049 --> 22:21.720
And you know, the visions,
they only last for like a--

22:32.849 --> 22:35.240
No, no.

22:42.170 --> 22:46.279
Groosalugg is the most formidable.
We have to get him out of the castle.

22:46.970 --> 22:48.269
If challenged, he must accept?

22:48.769 --> 22:53.019
As champion of the realm, he cannot
refuse. But no man can defeat him.

22:53.569 --> 22:55.920
We'll worry about that later.
First we get him out.

22:56.569 --> 22:59.099
Then we create diversions here,
here and here.

22:59.569 --> 23:02.380
We'll scale the wall here,
where their defenses are weak.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.730
I wouldn't split my crew up that much.

23:06.170 --> 23:09.150
I'm leading this charge.
Tell me about the killing device.

23:09.769 --> 23:12.400
It sends a signal
to the collar on every slave.

23:12.769 --> 23:15.400
- What kind of a signal?
- Blows their heads off.

23:16.970 --> 23:20.230
Silas will use it.
We have to get to him before he does.

23:21.170 --> 23:23.730
- The castle is well-guarded.
- Unlike this place.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.099
It's all right. It's all right.

23:27.170 --> 23:28.289
He's a friend.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.829
Glad we were keeping watch.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.470
He's Angel. He does that.
How's she do that?

23:33.769 --> 23:35.700
She's Fred. She does that too.

23:36.170 --> 23:38.170
Winifred?
The girl from Cordy's vision?

23:38.569 --> 23:40.009
Check the perimeter.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.069
These are my friends. Wesley, Gunn.

23:43.369 --> 23:44.380
Hi.

23:45.170 --> 23:48.680
These-- Those were the rebels.
We've joined forces.

23:49.369 --> 23:50.880
They made Wes their general.

23:51.170 --> 23:55.029
But you're here now.
If you want to, I mean....

23:55.970 --> 23:59.160
- You're much better at--
- No, Wes, I can't.

24:01.369 --> 24:03.190
You know what happens to me.

24:06.170 --> 24:07.819
I'm sorry.

24:09.769 --> 24:12.119
I'm ashamed for what I did to you.

24:13.369 --> 24:17.759
It's a crazy place here.
The sooner we all get out, the better.

24:18.769 --> 24:21.470
Fred can help us.
She knows a lot about the portals.

24:22.369 --> 24:23.380
Not a lot.

24:23.569 --> 24:27.990
The trionic speechcraft formulation
has to alter the reality sphere.

24:28.970 --> 24:33.109
Lutzbalm predicted it at Zurich in '89.
Laughed him off the stage.

24:33.769 --> 24:36.859
Although the slavery and degradation's
no laughing matter.

24:37.369 --> 24:40.849
It's no Crug-grain-and-Kalla-berry
breakfast all right.

24:43.369 --> 24:45.119
She's been here a while.

24:45.769 --> 24:48.750
Guys, I have some bad news
about the Host.

24:49.369 --> 24:52.039
We've captured this warrior
of the Deathwok Clan!

24:53.569 --> 24:55.319
- Landok.
- Angel the Drokken killer.

24:55.970 --> 24:58.220
I won't battle you for saving
this slave girl's neck.

24:58.369 --> 24:59.240
Good.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.410
It is forbidden to fight
while performing a sacred duty.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.859
I was transporting my kinsman home
when these fools stopped me.

25:07.369 --> 25:09.440
- They cut off the Host's head.
- What?

25:09.769 --> 25:12.230
- No.
- Yes, I have it right here.

25:21.769 --> 25:24.440
- He was....
- Yeah.

25:25.970 --> 25:29.059
That's it? Where's the praising
and extolling of my virtues?

25:29.569 --> 25:31.079
Where's the love?

25:44.089 --> 25:45.599
I'll only say this once.

25:45.890 --> 25:49.220
The guys you send to create
those diversions will die.

25:50.690 --> 25:52.230
Yes, they are.

25:56.089 --> 25:59.740
You try not to get anybody killed,
you wind up getting everybody killed.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.289
Get ready to move out.

26:07.490 --> 26:08.569
What should I do?

26:08.690 --> 26:12.869
Go to the village, call out
the Groosalugg and kill him.

26:14.089 --> 26:16.089
Kill their undefeated champion?

26:18.289 --> 26:20.819
- I can't, I'll turn into the beast.
- I know.

26:25.490 --> 26:27.950
When I fired you guys,
the reason I....

26:29.690 --> 26:33.480
The darkness was coming out of me.
I didn't want you near it.

26:33.890 --> 26:37.190
The thing that comes out here
is 10 times worse.

26:40.490 --> 26:43.650
I do this, you know
I won't come back from it.

26:44.089 --> 26:47.529
Yes, you will. I know you.

26:48.289 --> 26:49.160
We know you.

26:50.089 --> 26:53.710
We know you're a man with a demon
inside, not the other way around.

26:54.289 --> 26:58.470
You have the strength to do what's
needed, and you'll come back to us.

27:02.690 --> 27:06.410
I could go with you. I know
how to prepare the Challenge Torch.

27:08.089 --> 27:09.670
You'll come back.

27:20.089 --> 27:22.089
You really think he'll come back?

27:22.490 --> 27:24.839
I need him to think it.

27:31.890 --> 27:33.359
What can I get you?

27:34.890 --> 27:36.220
Nothing.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.309
Just don't leave.

27:40.890 --> 27:45.460
Whatever you do, don't fight a big,
ugly, pointy demon with green skin.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.609
I saw what he'll do to you.

27:49.890 --> 27:54.210
Good. I see we're progressing
towards mating. Let's get on with it.

27:54.690 --> 27:57.809
- What about the wedding?
- I tire of waiting. Do it.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.940
With you guys just standing around?
I don't think so.

28:02.490 --> 28:03.960
Then I'll encourage you.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.839
My lord, there's something in
the village you'll want to see.

28:27.690 --> 28:29.900
I challenge the Groosalugg
to mortal combat.

28:33.690 --> 28:36.779
Come out and face me,
you spineless coward!

28:37.289 --> 28:40.619
Why'd you add "coward"?
That's really gonna piss him off.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.730
What is it? Who's yelling?

28:45.089 --> 28:47.160
You've been challenged.
You must fight.

28:47.490 --> 28:51.390
What? No! No fighting.
I had a vision. He can't fight.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.829
Our honor is at stake.

28:54.690 --> 28:56.230
- Listen to me!
- Silence!

28:56.490 --> 29:00.880
No, don't do it! Please!
Don't do it, Groo! No!

29:01.289 --> 29:03.539
No! No!

29:05.490 --> 29:07.099
Who calls me out?

29:08.490 --> 29:11.329
- Do you love her?
- More than I thought possible.

29:11.490 --> 29:14.400
If this filth should win...

29:15.690 --> 29:19.019
...he will ravage
and he will defile her.

29:20.490 --> 29:23.789
He will use her
for his pleasure again...

29:25.289 --> 29:26.730
...and again.

29:28.890 --> 29:32.539
And when she has
no more screaming in her...

29:36.089 --> 29:38.299
...he will kill her.

29:39.089 --> 29:42.529
He will not. He will die!

29:45.690 --> 29:47.440
The Groosalugg has been challenged!

29:48.089 --> 29:51.390
He will fight the challenger
in the village square!

30:15.690 --> 30:19.829
Rebels at the south gate!
And at the north wall!

30:32.490 --> 30:35.650
Death to the state!
Death to the state!

30:36.089 --> 30:38.339
Death to the state!

31:10.890 --> 31:12.640
This guy doesn't feel pain?

31:13.289 --> 31:17.400
He feels it, but he's the Groosalugg.
He overcomes all things.

31:18.089 --> 31:19.349
Good luck.

31:20.490 --> 31:22.099
You will die, barbarian.

32:07.730 --> 32:09.980
You can't hold back. You'll die!

32:10.130 --> 32:12.410
Not holding back, holding on.

32:19.130 --> 32:22.750
- Rebels have reached the castle.
- It's Silas. Stop him!

32:23.329 --> 32:24.839
There they are!

32:49.130 --> 32:51.130
There you are.
Please, I had a vision.

32:51.529 --> 32:54.230
The beast is gonna kill him.
You have to stop it.

32:55.730 --> 32:57.660
This is all your fault.

32:58.730 --> 33:02.799
You think you can destroy
our way of life? Think again.

33:03.529 --> 33:06.160
I will kill every cow in the world...

33:06.529 --> 33:08.849
...before I'll allow that to happen.

33:10.130 --> 33:11.809
Every one of you.

33:30.529 --> 33:33.650
You would defile her! You animal!

34:05.930 --> 34:07.579
You're a little late.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.329
Stand down.

34:11.929 --> 34:16.349
- You don't have to do this.
- I don't have to, but I'm going to.

34:17.329 --> 34:20.380
And you and your filthy
cow princess can go to--

34:25.730 --> 34:29.768
Your cow princess is tired
of hearing you yak, padre,

34:30.530 --> 34:33.018
- Nice.
- These guys stay dead without a head?

34:33.530 --> 34:34.730
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

34:34.730 --> 34:38.349
We gotta get to the village.
The Groosalugg is facing a beast.

34:39.530 --> 34:42.440
Actually, the beast
he's facing is Angel.

35:06.610 --> 35:09.840
We're not gonna do this.
We're gonna find another way.

35:15.090 --> 35:16.670
I'm not an animal.

35:17.489 --> 35:20.679
- Stop! Stop the fight! Stop!
- All right...

35:21.090 --> 35:23.860
...what part of me being noble
didn't get through?

35:24.530 --> 35:27.300
Stop the fight. Don't hurt him. Stop.

35:28.130 --> 35:31.460
- I love him. I love him.
- You love me?

35:32.329 --> 35:35.349
Not you, dumb-ass.
Him. I love him.

35:40.130 --> 35:42.019
Lay down your weapons!

35:42.530 --> 35:45.550
Silas is dead.
All priests have been defeated.

35:46.130 --> 35:50.590
Any guard who harms a human from this
day forth shall have to answer to me!

35:51.530 --> 35:55.320
- But you love me too, right?
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

35:56.329 --> 35:59.210
- As a friend and coworker.
- We need medical attention!

35:59.929 --> 36:02.179
Maybe love is too strong a term.

36:08.769 --> 36:12.210
Good as new. Although I seem
to have put on about 158 pounds.

36:12.969 --> 36:15.429
You look great. Love the trousers.

36:15.969 --> 36:18.739
It's been a thrill, Mom.
See you in a millennium.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.309
Isn't there something you want
to say to your mother?

36:23.170 --> 36:26.360
- "May you burn in Tarkna"?
- Come on. She's not that bad.

36:26.769 --> 36:30.769
She didn't put your body on the maggot
pile like you thought she would.

36:32.170 --> 36:33.110
Go.

36:33.969 --> 36:34.840
Bye, Mom.

36:35.170 --> 36:39.030
Thanks for storing my body on the lice
pile instead of the maggot heap.

36:39.969 --> 36:42.570
I thought you were lost to us forever.

36:43.570 --> 36:46.059
But you came back.

36:47.170 --> 36:48.360
You came back.

36:48.369 --> 36:52.130
The runt of my loins came back
after raining misery on our lives...

36:53.170 --> 36:55.420
...and managed to shame us
even further!

36:56.170 --> 36:57.710
All right then, we'll be....

36:57.969 --> 37:01.380
Who will do our labor now that
your cow friend has freed the slaves?

37:02.170 --> 37:05.789
Do you know what they call me
at the Hall of Drink and Chance?

37:06.969 --> 37:08.480
Mother of the Vile Excrement!

37:08.769 --> 37:10.489
- Keep in touch.
- Go on, misfit!

37:11.170 --> 37:13.699
Back to your world
where no one knows his place!

37:14.170 --> 37:15.989
May you rot in Tarkna!

37:17.769 --> 37:21.699
- Every family's got its problems.
- Numfar, do the dance of shame.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.429
Yours more than most.

37:26.769 --> 37:29.820
My friend told me I had to come back.
I didn't believe her.

37:30.369 --> 37:32.690
I realized I did have
to come back, because...

37:33.369 --> 37:36.070
...I always thought I had
to come back deep down.

37:36.969 --> 37:40.590
I had to find out I didn't have
to come back. I don't belong here.

37:41.170 --> 37:42.889
I hate it here.
You know where I belong?

37:43.570 --> 37:45.710
L.A. You know why?

37:45.969 --> 37:49.829
Nobody belongs there. It's
the perfect place for guys like us.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.880
- Kind of beautiful.
- Ain't it?

37:53.170 --> 37:55.199
- I'm moved, if I say so myself.
- Please do.

37:55.570 --> 37:58.239
- I feel a song coming on.
- I thought you might.

37:59.170 --> 38:03.309
Somewhere over the rainbow

38:03.969 --> 38:05.900
Way up high

38:06.969 --> 38:08.440
I have a vision.

38:08.769 --> 38:12.670
Actually, two visions. In one
of them, you get to keep your head.

38:14.170 --> 38:17.190
- At your service, your majesty.
- Take a memo.

38:20.170 --> 38:24.210
As it is now written,
all citizens are created equal.

38:24.969 --> 38:28.480
Slavery and religious persecution
are outlawed.

38:36.369 --> 38:37.699
I think we did it.

38:38.170 --> 38:39.820
I opened portals,
but I couldn't tell where.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.809
You need the priests' formulas
to figure that out.

38:43.570 --> 38:47.079
- So we can go home?
- We take these and she says the words.

38:47.769 --> 38:49.769
Those are sacred books.

38:50.769 --> 38:54.099
Which you should have
as a small memento.

38:56.170 --> 38:59.010
You're in charge now,
and you've got a long road ahead.

38:59.769 --> 39:04.230
Slavery has ended,
but reconstruction has just begun.

39:05.769 --> 39:09.530
- What is this "reconstruction"?
- Gunn, you want to field this?

39:10.570 --> 39:13.659
It means saying people are free
don't make them free.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.800
You got races that hate each other.

39:17.170 --> 39:20.610
Some getting work they don't want,
others losing the little they had.

39:21.969 --> 39:26.219
You're looking at social confusion,
economic depression and maybe riots.

39:28.570 --> 39:29.579
Good luck.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.199
You'll do fine.

39:33.969 --> 39:37.940
It worries me, but not as much as....

39:42.369 --> 39:44.230
Do you have to go, majesty?

39:44.769 --> 39:46.449
I don't want to.

39:47.769 --> 39:52.300
I'm really gonna miss your eyes.
And the majesty thing.

39:54.969 --> 39:57.739
But I have a job to do back home.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.659
It was really fun being your princess.

40:29.769 --> 40:31.380
Godspeed, princess.

40:32.769 --> 40:34.030
Bye, Groo.

40:36.369 --> 40:37.449
Your majesty.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.150
Your majesty.

40:44.170 --> 40:48.309
- Should people bow in a free society?
- These things take time.

41:10.809 --> 41:14.599
I've been thinking about remodeling
the bar. Who wants a nightcap?

41:21.050 --> 41:22.099
Are you sure?

41:22.250 --> 41:26.110
Trust me. Tacos everywhere.
And soap.

41:27.050 --> 41:30.309
That portal-jumping is fun.
We can sell it to a theme park.

41:31.250 --> 41:34.269
- Can I say it? I want to say it.
- Say what?

41:36.409 --> 41:38.510
There's no place like--

41:44.809 --> 41:45.679
Willow?

41:46.610 --> 41:47.550
What's--?

41:53.809 --> 41:55.179
It's Buffy.

41:56.305 --> 42:02.244
