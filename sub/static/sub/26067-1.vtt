01:11.927 --> 01:14.959
Sorry, I didn't even
notice you there!

01:14.961 --> 01:15.919
No, no, no, no,
don't apologize!

01:15.921 --> 01:17.224
Don't apologize!

01:17.226 --> 01:18.223
Continue!

01:18.225 --> 01:19.183
Keep dancing.

01:20.183 --> 01:22.140
I must look crazy.

01:22.142 --> 01:23.138
It's just great
to see somebody

01:23.140 --> 01:24.752
loving the rain
so much.

01:24.754 --> 01:26.095
Well, don't you
just love it?

01:26.097 --> 01:26.940
No.

01:26.942 --> 01:27.900
What?

01:27.902 --> 01:29.244
No!

01:29.246 --> 01:30.703
You hate the rain?

01:30.705 --> 01:32.009
Yes!

01:32.971 --> 01:34.505
How could anyone
hate the rain?

01:34.507 --> 01:36.002
Well, I'm afraid
I might shrink.

01:37.387 --> 01:40.879
No, you have to
become one with it.

01:40.881 --> 01:42.761
Just melt into it.

01:42.763 --> 01:43.798
Don't resist.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.026
Oh!

01:45.028 --> 01:46.063
Ah!

01:46.065 --> 01:47.330
Ah, it's cold!

01:48.907 --> 01:50.556
Phew!

01:50.558 --> 01:52.478
Ah...

01:57.355 --> 01:59.004
Can I have one?

01:59.006 --> 02:01.733
Uh... yeah.

02:06.263 --> 02:07.606
Got a lighter too?

02:07.608 --> 02:09.526
Yeah, I do.

02:11.409 --> 02:12.406
Oh, be careful.

02:12.408 --> 02:14.709
Don't burn yourself.

02:14.711 --> 02:16.631
Got it lit?

02:19.819 --> 02:21.084
So you're that writer,
aren't you?

02:21.086 --> 02:23.006
Yes.

02:25.502 --> 02:26.229
From New York, right?

02:26.231 --> 02:28.073
Yes.

02:28.075 --> 02:29.340
Can I ask you
a question?

02:29.342 --> 02:30.531
Yes.

02:30.533 --> 02:33.564
Why would you leave New York
to come to this hole?

02:33.566 --> 02:34.639
I needed a change
of scenery.

02:34.641 --> 02:37.097
But New York...

02:37.099 --> 02:39.516
I mean, I would do anything
to visit New York!

02:39.518 --> 02:41.705
To... soak in
the architecture,

02:41.707 --> 02:43.165
the people...

02:43.167 --> 02:45.200
see the shows
on Broadway.

02:45.202 --> 02:47.004
Ha-have...
Do we...

02:47.006 --> 02:48.924
do we know
each other?

02:48.926 --> 02:50.153
No.

02:50.155 --> 02:52.034
No, but everyone knows
who you are.

02:52.036 --> 02:54.223
You're the famous author
living in Goose Cove.

02:54.225 --> 02:56.145
Yeah.

02:57.797 --> 03:00.444
I gotta go.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.364
Don't tell anyone
I smoke, okay?

03:02.366 --> 03:04.821
Okay.

03:04.823 --> 03:06.895
Goodbye, Mr. Author.

03:06.897 --> 03:08.432
I hope I'll see you
again sometime.

03:08.434 --> 03:10.354
Me too.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.348
What's your name?

03:12.350 --> 03:14.308
Nola.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.025
<i>Sommerdale Police,
how can I help you?</i>

04:10.027 --> 04:12.598
It's Deborah Cooper
in Side Creek Lane.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.519
Uh... I...

04:13.521 --> 04:15.823
Come quick! Right now!

04:15.825 --> 04:17.283
<i>You heard prowlers
again, Mrs. Cooper?</i>

04:17.285 --> 04:18.512
No, no, it's a girl!

04:18.514 --> 04:21.545
She's being chased
in the woods by a man!

04:21.547 --> 04:22.774
I-I was making an apple pie,

04:22.776 --> 04:25.884
heard a scream,
and looked out the screen door.

04:25.886 --> 04:27.343
She was wearing a red dress.

04:27.345 --> 04:28.649
She's...

04:28.651 --> 04:30.339
she's running
through the forest,

04:30.341 --> 04:31.644
and he's chasing her.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.681
<i>I'm sending
a patrol car over</i>

04:32.683 --> 04:34.102
<i>right away, Mrs. Cooper.</i>

04:34.104 --> 04:35.139
<i>Please stay where you are.</i>

04:55.339 --> 04:57.180
Hurry!

07:21.873 --> 07:24.022
<i>This is me, Marcus Goldman.</i>

07:24.024 --> 07:27.247
<i>At the age of 26,
I had written my first novel,</i>

07:27.249 --> 07:28.629
<i>which sold
over a million copies,</i>

07:28.631 --> 07:32.355
<i>propelling me onto
everyone's must-read list.</i>

07:32.357 --> 07:33.622
<i>I was suddenly a celebrity.</i>

07:33.624 --> 07:35.388
<i>My book, "G is for Goldstein,"</i>

07:35.390 --> 07:37.077
<i>was heralded far and wide</i>

07:37.079 --> 07:39.344
<i>as the work of an original
and rare talent,</i>

07:39.346 --> 07:41.686
<i>even by the toughest
of New York critics.</i>

07:41.688 --> 07:43.798
<i>Suddenly, everything I said</i>

07:43.800 --> 07:46.025
<i>was of interest and hilarious.</i>

07:46.027 --> 07:48.367
<i>No more dining on ramen.</i>

07:48.369 --> 07:50.594
<i>It's now Peking duck

08:00.389 --> 08:04.188

named Denise,</i>

08:04.190 --> 08:06.838
<i>who I think might have had
a little crush on me.</i>

08:06.840 --> 08:08.028
<i>For the first six months</i>

08:08.030 --> 08:09.987
<i>after the publication
of my book,</i>

08:09.989 --> 08:12.674
<i>life was a writer's wet dream.</i>

08:12.676 --> 08:14.287
<i>There were book signings</i>

08:14.289 --> 08:16.207
<i>and a contract
for my next two novels,</i>

08:16.209 --> 08:17.935
<i>with a little advance
thrown in there</i>

08:17.937 --> 08:19.241
<i>for good measure.</i>

08:19.243 --> 08:20.738
Wow. Thank you!

08:20.740 --> 08:22.850
<i>Success does have
its drawbacks,</i>

08:22.852 --> 08:25.347
<i>like what to say
when someone asks you...</i>

08:25.349 --> 08:26.921
So what's
your next book about?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.418
<i>It had been over a year</i>

08:28.420 --> 08:30.838
<i>since the publication
of my first book,</i>

08:30.840 --> 08:32.988
<i>and I still had not written
a single word</i>

08:32.990 --> 08:34.524
<i>of the next one.</i>

08:34.525 --> 08:35.751
<i>Not that I didn't try.</i>

08:35.754 --> 08:37.519
<i>Inspiration had abandoned me,</i>

08:37.520 --> 08:39.056
<i>and I was scared shitless,</i>

08:39.058 --> 08:42.434
<i>because where I come from,
failure is not an option.</i>

08:42.437 --> 08:44.085
<i>Even in high school,</i>

08:44.087 --> 08:46.505
<i>Marcus Goldman always found
some way to come out a winner.</i>

08:46.507 --> 08:47.695
<i>I figured out pretty early</i>

08:47.697 --> 08:50.268
<i>the best way
to stand out in a crowd</i>

08:50.270 --> 08:53.918
<i>was to pick the right crowd
to stand out in.</i>

08:56.260 --> 08:57.833
<i>My strategy was so successful,</i>

08:57.835 --> 09:01.634
<i>I soon became known as
"Marcus the Magnificent."</i>

09:01.636 --> 09:03.900
<i>See, the trouble is,
the more you win,</i>

09:03.902 --> 09:06.166
<i>the more terrifying it is
to lose,</i>

09:06.168 --> 09:08.930
<i>and I was on the verge
of losing everything.</i>

09:08.932 --> 09:10.659
<i>I tried everything
to get unblocked.</i>

09:10.661 --> 09:13.539
<i>I escaped to the desert
for solitude,</i>

09:13.541 --> 09:17.570
<i>to reconnect
with my inner voice.</i>

09:17.572 --> 09:19.145
<i>I even returned
to my old room in New Jersey</i>

09:19.147 --> 09:20.220
<i>hoping for inspiration...</i>

09:20.222 --> 09:22.601
Shh!
He's writing!

09:22.603 --> 09:24.482
<i>The trouble with
being hailed as a genius</i>

09:24.484 --> 09:26.249
<i>is that now
everything you write</i>

09:26.251 --> 09:28.169
<i>is expected to be
a literary gem,</i>

09:28.171 --> 09:32.355
<i>some timeless insight
into the human condition.</i>

09:32.357 --> 09:34.159
<i>The pressure
to live up to the hype</i>

09:34.161 --> 09:35.311
<i>froze me.</i>

09:35.313 --> 09:37.269
<i>There was only one person
I knew</i>

09:37.271 --> 09:38.921
<i>who could help me
cut through the bullshit</i>

09:38.923 --> 09:40.726
<i>and bring me back to reality,</i>

09:40.728 --> 09:42.915
<i>Harry Quebert,</i>

09:42.917 --> 09:45.602
<i>best-selling author,
my former college professor,</i>

09:45.604 --> 09:49.022
<i>and one of the greatest writers
of the 20th century.</i>

10:05.726 --> 10:07.759
Oh, Marcus!

10:07.761 --> 10:09.295
Is this really you?

10:09.297 --> 10:10.524
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

10:10.526 --> 10:11.944
- It is?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

10:11.946 --> 10:13.519
- Incredible.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

10:13.521 --> 10:14.786
I know, I'm, uh...

10:14.788 --> 10:16.323
sorry, Harry.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.050
I've been completely
off the grid.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.548
<i>I haven't heard from you</i>

10:19.550 --> 10:21.429
<i>since you became a star.</i>

10:21.431 --> 10:23.234
I tried to call you
about a month ago.

10:23.236 --> 10:24.233
Your assistant said

10:24.235 --> 10:26.153
you weren't taking calls
from anybody.

10:26.155 --> 10:28.226
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

10:28.228 --> 10:30.300
<i>totally blocked, Harry.</i>

10:30.302 --> 10:32.604
<i>It's been over a year,
and I got nothing...</i>

10:32.606 --> 10:34.601
except a deadline
I'm not gonna meet.

10:34.603 --> 10:36.636
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:36.638 --> 10:38.326
<i>That second one
is always the toughest.</i>

10:38.328 --> 10:39.478
Yeah.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.282
<i>A lot of expectation
out there...</i>

10:41.284 --> 10:43.164
and creativity
just does not thrive

10:43.166 --> 10:45.122
when there is a deadline.

10:45.124 --> 10:46.274
It's like sex,

10:46.276 --> 10:48.233
but there's no
little blue pill for a writer.

10:48.235 --> 10:49.999
You know, why don't you
come to me?

10:50.001 --> 10:51.650
<i>Just get out of New York.</i>

10:51.652 --> 10:53.148
<i>Have a change
of scenery, you know?</i>

10:53.150 --> 10:54.108
Really?

10:54.110 --> 10:55.183
<i>Go for a run on the beach,</i>

10:55.185 --> 10:57.142
<i>get your creative juices
going.</i>

10:57.144 --> 10:59.446
You know?

10:59.448 --> 11:00.943
Let inspiration come to you.

11:00.945 --> 11:02.441
Okay.

11:02.443 --> 11:03.670
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:03.672 --> 11:07.049
It's a deal. I'll, uh...
I'll see you this weekend.

11:07.051 --> 11:08.971
<i>All right.</i>

11:16.996 --> 11:18.607
<i>I loved driving to Maine.</i>

11:18.609 --> 11:20.604
<i>I knew Sommerdale well,</i>

11:20.606 --> 11:24.368
<i>having visited Harry there
several times as a student.</i>

11:24.370 --> 11:27.247
<i>I loved this little town
forgotten by time,</i>

11:27.249 --> 11:28.707
<i>its churches,</i>

11:28.709 --> 11:31.855
<i>peaceful neighborhoods
of painted wooden houses,</i>

11:31.857 --> 11:33.314
<i>the shops,</i>

11:33.316 --> 11:36.770
<i>and Clark's,
the town's historic diner</i>

11:36.772 --> 11:38.115
<i>where Harry and I would eat</i>

11:38.117 --> 11:40.457
<i>and spend hours
talking about life,</i>

11:40.459 --> 11:42.799
<i>and books, and...</i>

11:42.801 --> 11:45.336
<i>and what it meant
to be a writer.</i>

11:48.830 --> 11:50.671
<i>Harry was living
a few miles away,</i>

11:50.673 --> 11:53.167
<i>isolated amongst
the tranquil wilderness</i>

11:53.169 --> 11:54.819
<i>of the coastal forest</i>

11:54.821 --> 11:57.736
<i>in a beautiful stone
and solid pine house</i>

11:57.738 --> 11:59.350
<i>with an ocean view</i>

11:59.352 --> 12:03.077
<i>and a deck overlooking
an endless beach.</i>

12:24.197 --> 12:26.153
Marcus the Magnificent!

12:26.155 --> 12:27.689
Hey, Harry.

12:27.691 --> 12:28.764
You made it!

12:28.766 --> 12:30.184
- How are you, man?
- It's good to see you!

12:30.186 --> 12:31.759
It's good
to see you too!

12:31.761 --> 12:33.180
Welcome back.

12:33.182 --> 12:34.985
It's good
to see you, man.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.405
This is new.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.596
This is new,
it looks good.

12:37.598 --> 12:39.518
I painted it.

12:40.209 --> 12:41.090
Welcome.

12:41.092 --> 12:42.511
Please.
Thanks, man.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.278
Oh, God,
it's good to be back.

12:56.606 --> 12:59.062
First, get good
at being patient.

12:59.064 --> 13:01.327
The more patient you are,
the more likely it is

13:01.329 --> 13:03.631
your muse will
pay you a visit.

13:03.633 --> 13:05.359
But you know me, Harry.

13:05.361 --> 13:07.855
Patience has never
been my strong suit.

13:07.857 --> 13:09.545
Especially now.

13:09.547 --> 13:12.387
And stop trying to write
the Great American Novel.

13:12.389 --> 13:14.191
That will only paralyze you.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.497
You can't write from fear.

13:15.499 --> 13:16.802
Then what do I
write from?

13:16.804 --> 13:20.181
'Cause right now, fear's
the only thing I got.

13:20.183 --> 13:22.716
That and terror.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.020
You have to write
what matters to you.

13:25.022 --> 13:27.286
Screw all the voices
in your head,

13:27.288 --> 13:28.553
the ones judging you,

13:28.555 --> 13:31.625
telling you what you should
or should not write about.

13:31.627 --> 13:35.004
Go with your gut,
the idea that excites you.

13:35.006 --> 13:35.695
And what if
I change my mind

13:35.697 --> 13:37.999
halfway through?

13:38.001 --> 13:40.073
You can always
change your mind,

13:40.075 --> 13:41.609
go in a different direction.

13:41.611 --> 13:42.953
The point is to write,

13:42.955 --> 13:44.143
pen to paper.

13:44.145 --> 13:48.137
The words are immaterial,
it's all about the idea.

13:48.139 --> 13:50.095
Is that helping?

13:50.097 --> 13:51.286
It's pretty
simple, yeah...

13:51.288 --> 13:52.553
No, it's not helping.

13:52.555 --> 13:53.398
He needs
some inspiration.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.281
What can you
say to him?

13:54.283 --> 13:55.356
Oh, well,

13:55.358 --> 13:57.506
it helps if you sit
where he's sitting.

13:57.508 --> 13:59.429
Just for good luck.

14:00.234 --> 14:01.192
Thanks, Jenny.

14:01.194 --> 14:03.419
Thank you, Jenny.

14:03.421 --> 14:05.342
Ah, yes...

14:16.138 --> 14:17.481
Okay, I'm off.

14:17.483 --> 14:19.746
My last class
is around 5:00,

14:19.748 --> 14:21.897
so let's have cocktails
on the deck

14:21.899 --> 14:23.202
at 6:00 sharp, okay?

14:23.204 --> 14:24.124
Okay, great.

14:24.126 --> 14:25.122
Yeah, listen, if I'm not here,

14:25.124 --> 14:26.389
my body will probably
wash up on shore

14:26.391 --> 14:27.503
in a few days' time.

14:27.505 --> 14:28.848
Not going well?

14:28.850 --> 14:29.923
No.

14:29.925 --> 14:31.151
No, are you kidding?
It's extraordinary.

14:31.153 --> 14:33.378
It's, uh, yeah,
completely unpredictable.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.416
Can't wait to find out
what happens next.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.713
You haven't written
anything at all.

14:40.715 --> 14:43.247
Not... not
entirely true.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.359
I, uh... texted Sofia.

14:45.361 --> 14:47.394
- Well, sexted her.
- Hmm.

14:47.396 --> 14:49.891
That's probably the appropriate
nomenclature, but, uh...

14:49.893 --> 14:50.966
it's actually the best writing

14:50.968 --> 14:52.425
I've done all year.

14:52.427 --> 14:55.113
All right.

14:55.115 --> 14:58.569
Just tell me
how you did it, man.

14:58.571 --> 15:00.259
Oh, you sat in a diner
day after day?

15:00.261 --> 15:02.524
You wrote a masterpiece
in one summer?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.215
Okay.

15:03.217 --> 15:06.095
Write what interests you.

15:06.097 --> 15:07.938
Or yet, better yet, you know,
just don't write at all.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.089
Live.

15:10.091 --> 15:11.164
Don't make...

15:11.166 --> 15:13.660
life about your work.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.812
Or you'll end up
like me.

15:17.847 --> 15:18.882
6:00, drinks.

15:18.884 --> 15:20.804
Yeah.

15:31.940 --> 15:32.860
So, what's the next

15:32.862 --> 15:34.857
Marcus Goldman
masterpiece about?

15:35.741 --> 15:36.776
Give us a little hint.

15:36.778 --> 15:37.698
Well, you know,
the writing process

15:37.700 --> 15:39.350
is a very fragile thing,

15:39.352 --> 15:41.577
you know, much,
much like an unborn child.

15:41.579 --> 15:44.610
It needs to incubate
until it's fully formed,

15:44.612 --> 15:47.375
and then,
much like childbirth itself,

15:47.377 --> 15:48.489
it can be a painful process
to see through...

15:49.873 --> 15:51.793
You're so full of shit.

16:08.459 --> 16:10.417
<i>How the hell did he do it?</i>

17:36.318 --> 17:37.391
Hey.

17:37.393 --> 17:40.847
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:40.849 --> 17:42.769
Oh, um...

17:44.843 --> 17:46.763
Just...

17:53.367 --> 17:55.439
What, are you
spying on me, Marcus?

17:55.441 --> 17:57.743
No, no, no,
Harry, I just, um...

17:57.745 --> 17:59.163
Um...

17:59.165 --> 18:01.199
You go through
my personal things?

18:01.201 --> 18:03.121
I'm s... I'm sorry.

18:10.685 --> 18:12.605
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have opened it.

18:21.860 --> 18:25.201
She was someone I once knew.

18:26.469 --> 18:28.388
It's complicated.

18:31.768 --> 18:33.916
This needs to stay...

18:33.918 --> 18:35.838
between us.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.137
Do you understand me?

18:40.139 --> 18:42.018
Yeah.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.630
Yeah, you have
my word.

19:04.638 --> 19:05.903
Don't be a stranger.

19:05.905 --> 19:06.786
Yeah.

19:06.788 --> 19:08.708
Yeah, you too.

19:11.819 --> 19:12.623
Thanks again, Harry.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.545
Mm-hmm.

19:44.075 --> 19:44.840
<i>You listening?</i>

19:44.842 --> 19:46.377
Mm-hmm.

19:46.379 --> 19:48.604
Well, how are
things looking?

19:48.606 --> 19:50.217
<i>So, we got Joe Fryman,
the top litigator in the city,</i>

19:50.219 --> 19:51.983
<i>to review your contract
with Schmid and Hanson.</i>

19:51.985 --> 19:53.135
And?

19:53.137 --> 19:54.594
<i>You're totally screwed.</i>

19:54.596 --> 19:55.861
<i>Either you deliver up
a new draft</i>

19:55.863 --> 19:57.320
<i>by the agreed-upon date,</i>

19:57.322 --> 19:59.547
<i>or they take
everything you own.</i>

19:59.549 --> 20:02.159
Okay, what if I sign everything
over to my parents?

20:02.161 --> 20:04.118
Like, including the condo.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.576
<i>The repo men
will just go after them.</i>

20:05.578 --> 20:07.535
<i>Probably lock them up
for collusion.</i>

20:07.537 --> 20:08.457
For how long?

20:08.459 --> 20:09.378
<i>What?</i>

20:09.380 --> 20:10.223
Uh, nothing.

20:10.225 --> 20:11.222
Nothing, never mind.

20:11.224 --> 20:13.026
Hey, listen...

20:13.028 --> 20:14.601
I got another call
coming in, okay?

20:14.603 --> 20:16.444
Just talk to me when
you've got some good news.

20:16.446 --> 20:18.056
Prick.

20:18.058 --> 20:19.979
Hello?

20:22.551 --> 20:24.815
<i>She's...</i>

20:24.817 --> 20:27.541
<i>she's dead.</i>

20:27.543 --> 20:29.308
<i>She's dead, Marcus.</i>

20:29.310 --> 20:31.230
Uh... who?
Uh, who's dead?

20:32.228 --> 20:34.645
<i>Nola.</i>

20:34.647 --> 20:36.681
<i>Nola's dead.</i>

20:36.683 --> 20:39.868
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

20:39.870 --> 20:42.518
<i>What did I do?</i>

20:42.520 --> 20:44.630
<i>What did I do, for God's sake?</i>

20:44.632 --> 20:46.511
H-Harry? Harry, what
are you talking about?

20:46.513 --> 20:47.663
I don't...

20:47.665 --> 20:49.237
Harry!

20:49.239 --> 20:50.889
God dammit.

20:50.891 --> 20:52.156
Uh...

20:53.885 --> 20:55.382
<i>This is Harry.
Leave a message.</i>

20:55.384 --> 20:56.994
Shit.

20:56.996 --> 20:59.222
Okay, um...

20:59.224 --> 21:00.566
I have to get my shit together.

21:03.678 --> 21:04.905
Hey, what do you mean,
it's all your fault?

21:04.907 --> 21:06.095
I don't...

21:06.097 --> 21:07.247
<i>Hey, are you watching this?</i>

21:07.249 --> 21:08.745
Doug? Doug!
Uh, sorry, man.

21:08.747 --> 21:09.782
I thought you were, um...

21:09.784 --> 21:10.895
<i>Turn on the TV.</i>

21:10.897 --> 21:12.086
What channel?

21:12.088 --> 21:13.429
<i>Take your pick.</i>

21:13.431 --> 21:14.811
<i>...Sommerdale, Maine,</i>

21:14.813 --> 21:17.922
<i>that author Harry Quebert
was arrested today</i>

21:17.924 --> 21:21.340
<i>after police discovered
human remains on his property.</i>

21:21.342 --> 21:23.644
<i>The discovery was made
early this morning,</i>

21:23.646 --> 21:24.527
<i>when a landscaping crew</i>

21:24.529 --> 21:25.909
<i>hired by Mr. Quebert</i>

21:25.911 --> 21:28.060
<i>to plant a flower bed
of hydrangeas</i>

21:28.062 --> 21:29.596
<i>uncovered the remains</i>

21:29.598 --> 21:31.785
<i>buried less than 100 feet
from his house...</i>

21:31.787 --> 21:32.937
It's insane.

21:32.939 --> 21:34.434
<i>According to police,</i>

21:34.436 --> 21:39.119
<i>this may be the body of
15-year-old Nola Kellergan,</i>

21:39.121 --> 21:41.538
<i>a local girl who disappeared
from her house</i>

21:41.540 --> 21:42.690
<i>in August of 1975.</i>

21:42.692 --> 21:44.342
<i>You still there?</i>

21:44.344 --> 21:45.570
<i>...the evidence
found with the body</i>

21:45.572 --> 21:47.989
<i>seems to implicate
Mr. Quebert,</i>

21:47.991 --> 21:50.255
<i>one of the most respected
American writers,</i>

21:50.257 --> 21:51.368
<i>whose book,
"The Origin of Evil,"</i>

21:51.370 --> 21:53.327
<i>fascinated millions,</i>

21:53.329 --> 21:55.362
<i>in the murder
of the young girl,</i>

21:55.364 --> 21:57.436
<i>as well as in the death
of Deborah Cooper,</i>

21:57.438 --> 21:59.624
<i>a witness who was shot
and killed in her residence</i>

21:59.626 --> 22:00.661
<i>at the edge of the forest...</i>

22:00.663 --> 22:01.736
<i>Marcus, you okay?</i>

22:01.738 --> 22:03.426
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this doesn't...

22:03.428 --> 22:04.770
This doesn't make...

22:04.772 --> 22:06.920
Why? What, he's gonna
bring someone in

22:06.922 --> 22:09.339
to dig up a place where
he supposedly buried a body?

22:09.341 --> 22:10.299
This makes no sense.

22:10.301 --> 22:11.529
This is...
this is a mistake, man.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.604
<i>Look, there was a corpse</i>

22:12.606 --> 22:13.486
<i>buried in his yard,</i>

22:13.488 --> 22:14.793
<i>however you look at it.</i>

22:14.795 --> 22:15.560
<i>Hi, Mom?</i>

22:15.562 --> 22:16.905
Oh, sweetie,

22:16.907 --> 22:18.632
please tell me
you're not on your way

22:18.634 --> 22:20.629
to visit that horrible,
terrible man.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.935
<i>No, Mom,
I'm not stupid enough</i>

22:21.937 --> 22:23.548
<i>to get myself
in the middle of all that.</i>

22:23.550 --> 22:25.353
<i>I always had this
"Uh-oh!" feeling about him.</i>

22:25.355 --> 22:26.773
Yeah, well,

22:26.775 --> 22:29.154
you shouldn't believe everything
you hear on the news, okay?

22:29.156 --> 22:30.422
<i>He's a classic borderline.</i>

22:30.424 --> 22:31.689
The man is an animal.

22:31.691 --> 22:33.224
With boundary issues.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.336
He's not an animal, Ma,
he's my friend.

22:35.338 --> 22:37.563
How... close
a friend, sweetie?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.868
Look, Mom, I gotta go, okay?

22:39.870 --> 22:41.980
I'm, uh, I'm meeting
someone for coffee.

22:41.982 --> 22:43.631
<i>A girl? Or a boy?</i>

22:43.633 --> 22:45.553
Uh-huh,
I love you too, Mom. Bye.

22:51.697 --> 22:53.423
<i>We are here at Goose Cove</i>

22:53.425 --> 22:54.805
<i>at the gate</i>

22:54.807 --> 22:56.764
<i>of author Harry Quebert's
seafront property,</i>

22:56.766 --> 22:58.223
<i>where the famous writer
was arrested yesterday.</i>

22:58.225 --> 22:59.451
Shit...

22:59.453 --> 23:01.180
<i>...The rumor spreading
among journal...</i>

23:01.182 --> 23:02.523
Here he comes!
Here!

23:02.525 --> 23:03.407
Marcus!

23:03.409 --> 23:04.867
Hey, it's Marcus Goldman!

23:04.869 --> 23:07.017
Did you ever
suspect that...

23:07.901 --> 23:09.821
Why are you at
Mr. Quebert's house?

23:10.551 --> 23:11.701
Hey, Roth,
get in!

23:12.510 --> 23:14.005
Thank you.

23:14.007 --> 23:15.618
Keep... keep driving.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.154
Step on it. You're late!

23:17.156 --> 23:18.805
I told you to meet me here
half an hour ago.

23:18.807 --> 23:19.804
Time is money.

23:19.806 --> 23:20.687
Mr. Goldman!

23:20.689 --> 23:21.724
How's Harry?

23:21.726 --> 23:22.684
He, uh...

23:22.686 --> 23:23.683
He wanted me to, uh...

23:23.685 --> 23:24.680
Come on, get outta here!

23:24.682 --> 23:26.140
He wants you to go home

23:26.142 --> 23:29.135
and focus
on your goddamn book.

23:29.137 --> 23:31.324
Oh, and he wanted me to tell you
that he's innocent.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.284
Okay, how's it looking for him?

23:32.286 --> 23:33.513
Not good.

23:33.515 --> 23:36.930
They found a manuscript
of his "Origin of Evil"

23:36.932 --> 23:38.197
buried with the dead girl.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.040
That's insane, man!

23:40.042 --> 23:42.037
And that cannot get out,
under any circumstances.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.036
Well, can you get him
released on bail?

23:43.038 --> 23:44.264
Are you fuckin' nuts?

23:44.266 --> 23:45.993
We're talking about
double homicide!

23:45.995 --> 23:47.915
That's 25 to Life
on each count.

23:49.604 --> 23:51.138
Where are you staying?

23:51.140 --> 23:54.709
'Cause, you know, Harry said
that if you refuse to leave,

23:54.711 --> 23:55.708
which he predicted
you would, because you're...

23:55.710 --> 23:57.513
...a stubborn
son of a bitch, yeah.

23:57.515 --> 23:58.856
...that you could stay here.

23:58.858 --> 24:01.622
But like I told him, I mean,
this is a crime scene now.

24:01.624 --> 24:04.117
Aw, look, they've spawned!

24:05.348 --> 24:07.381
Oh, great,
more jackals!

24:07.383 --> 24:08.456
Holy shit!

24:09.572 --> 24:10.415
Come on!

24:12.605 --> 24:14.370
Come on, come on, come on.

24:14.372 --> 24:16.060
Hey, you know this is
private property, right?

24:16.062 --> 24:17.749
Private property!
Do you hear that?

24:17.751 --> 24:18.939
No comment.

24:18.941 --> 24:20.629
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

24:20.631 --> 24:22.818
The local boys
really fucked up

24:22.820 --> 24:24.470
by not sealing off
the house,

24:24.472 --> 24:25.698
because now, if they
find anything inside,

24:25.700 --> 24:27.426
we can claim
that they planted it.

24:27.428 --> 24:28.962
Okay, so technically,
I can stay in the house, yes?

24:28.964 --> 24:30.536
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.226
Back off.

24:32.228 --> 24:33.993
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:33.995 --> 24:37.909
I'm, uh, supposed to remind you
to feed the seagulls.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.676
Bunch of flying water rats,
if you ask me.

24:39.678 --> 24:40.943
Mr. Roth, can we get
a statement?

24:40.945 --> 24:42.364
Just go home, guys.
Go home.

24:42.366 --> 24:43.669
No comment.
Thank you.

25:54.027 --> 25:57.520
I know we're all very excited

25:57.522 --> 26:00.361
about what's been going on
in Washington at the moment.

26:00.363 --> 26:01.859
In the entire history

26:01.861 --> 26:03.626
of the United States
of America,

26:03.628 --> 26:04.816
there has been two reasons

26:04.818 --> 26:08.463
for terminating
a presidential term of office:

26:08.465 --> 26:10.345
criminal wrongdoing,

26:10.347 --> 26:12.342
à la Richard Nixon,

26:12.344 --> 26:13.647
and dying,

26:13.649 --> 26:18.256
but now, a third one
may be added to the list.

26:18.258 --> 26:23.209
Mr. Clinton revived
a failing economy,

26:23.211 --> 26:24.284
governed expertly

26:24.286 --> 26:27.356
with a Republican majority
in the senate,

26:27.358 --> 26:31.465
made Rabin and Arafat
shake hands,

26:31.467 --> 26:34.384
and all anyone will remember

26:34.386 --> 26:36.572
is the Lewinsky affair,

26:36.574 --> 26:39.337
because America,
ladies and gentlemen,

26:39.339 --> 26:42.947
is obsessed with sex
and morality.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.368
Scandal sells.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.326
We pretend to be shocked,
but we love it!

26:46.328 --> 26:47.632
We love it

26:47.634 --> 26:49.590
when someone gets caught
doing something bad, don't we?

26:49.592 --> 26:50.435
Excuse me.

26:50.437 --> 26:51.510
Uh, sorry,

26:51.512 --> 26:53.853
why... why are
blowjobs bad?

26:54.776 --> 26:55.850
I just, I'm just
personally,

26:55.852 --> 26:56.617
I'm a big fan.
I don't know.

26:57.733 --> 26:59.881
Really, is that so?

26:59.883 --> 27:01.916
Well, my brave young man,
please stand up.

27:01.918 --> 27:03.721
Identify yourself.

27:03.723 --> 27:04.835
Okay.

27:04.837 --> 27:07.139
Afternoon, um...

27:07.141 --> 27:08.598
My name is Marcus Goldman,

27:08.600 --> 27:10.557
and I stand with the president.

27:10.559 --> 27:11.939
Um... that said,

27:11.941 --> 27:13.859
I do believe
in gender equality,

27:13.861 --> 27:15.510
so I think it's important
to give as well as receive.

27:15.512 --> 27:16.470
I'd like that on the record.

27:17.317 --> 27:18.390
Now, you see?

27:18.392 --> 27:20.924
This poor boy will never
be seen the same way

27:20.926 --> 27:21.999
ever again.

27:22.001 --> 27:24.457
Now every time
we look at this man,

27:24.459 --> 27:27.145
we will see
and think of him

27:27.147 --> 27:28.528
as Mr. Blowjob.

27:29.528 --> 27:31.907
Or would you prefer
Mr. Fellatio?

27:32.792 --> 27:33.597
It's a little
more refined...

27:33.599 --> 27:34.479
Oh, thank you.

27:34.481 --> 27:35.593
Yeah, no, thank you.

27:35.595 --> 27:37.936
Would you like to just
express to the group

27:37.938 --> 27:41.545
why you decided to...
state this?

27:41.547 --> 27:44.349
Uh, because, Professor Quebert,

27:44.351 --> 27:46.230
now that I have
everyone's attention,

27:46.232 --> 27:48.726
I have the pleasure
of informing you all

27:48.728 --> 27:51.183
that I write
very good short stories

27:51.185 --> 27:52.374
that appear
in the literary magazine,

27:52.376 --> 27:54.447
issues of which will be
on sale for only $5.00

27:54.449 --> 27:56.369
after class.

28:04.127 --> 28:06.124
Sorry, we're sold out.

28:07.237 --> 28:08.349
How'd it go?

28:08.351 --> 28:09.846
We almost sold out.

28:09.848 --> 28:11.074
Congratulations.

28:11.076 --> 28:12.534
Thank you.
As they say,

28:12.536 --> 28:15.068
any publicity is
good publicity, right?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.105
And, like, 10 girls

28:16.107 --> 28:17.027
gave me their
phone numbers.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.486
It pays to advertise.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.212
Here, I saved the
last copy for you.

28:21.214 --> 28:23.056
Well, I look forward
to reading it.

28:23.058 --> 28:24.093
Thanks.

28:24.095 --> 28:25.859
I really hope you like
my short story.

28:25.861 --> 28:27.241
You're, um...

28:27.243 --> 28:29.622
Yeah, you're the reason
I'm here, Professor.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.502
You're what
I aspire to be, sir.

28:32.504 --> 28:33.846
Okay.

28:33.848 --> 28:35.421
Uh, it's
gonna be $5.00.

28:35.423 --> 28:36.342
I'm sorry?

28:36.344 --> 28:37.571
For the magazine.

28:37.573 --> 28:40.028
A-ha!

28:40.030 --> 28:42.102
Oh, Mr. Goldman,

28:42.104 --> 28:43.292
I have no doubt

28:43.294 --> 28:45.560
that you're going to be
a huge success.

28:47.557 --> 28:49.477
Why, thank you.

29:15.090 --> 29:16.125
Whatever
happened to

29:16.127 --> 29:19.465
innocent until
proven guilty?

29:19.467 --> 29:21.386
I can't just
leave it there.

29:21.388 --> 29:23.843
The whole thing
makes me wanna puke.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.571
Oh, shit.

29:25.573 --> 29:27.798
Go back
to New York, Marcus.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.064
Stay far away
from all this.

29:30.066 --> 29:31.177
Does that mean
you won't serve me

29:31.179 --> 29:33.904
your famous
pancakes and sausage?

29:33.906 --> 29:34.863
You better leave
one hell of a tip.

29:34.865 --> 29:36.785
Yeah.

29:42.161 --> 29:44.694
I, uh... saw you
on TV last night.

29:44.696 --> 29:45.616
Oh yeah?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.228
Are you, uh...

29:47.230 --> 29:48.803
you moving here?

29:48.805 --> 29:49.686
Yeah.

29:49.688 --> 29:50.607
Yeah, maybe.

29:50.609 --> 29:52.529
How come?

29:54.449 --> 29:56.253
I can't believe he did that.

29:56.255 --> 29:58.175
It's unthinkable.

29:58.673 --> 30:01.592
Well, you don't think
he actually killed her, do you?

30:02.936 --> 30:04.777
She was...

30:04.779 --> 30:05.929
She...

30:05.931 --> 30:07.851
She used to come
into the library after school.

30:09.118 --> 30:10.306
Such a sweet girl.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.765
I can't believe how many times
I sat on the deck

30:12.767 --> 30:14.070
having a scotch with Harry,

30:14.072 --> 30:16.758
and all the time,
the body of that poor girl...

30:16.760 --> 30:17.756
Marcus!

30:17.758 --> 30:18.563
Good to see you.

30:18.565 --> 30:19.408
Hi, Travis.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.253
Uh, may I?

30:20.255 --> 30:21.289
Please, yeah.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.365
Here you go.

30:22.367 --> 30:23.938
I'm, uh...

30:23.940 --> 30:24.899
I'm sorry, son.

30:24.901 --> 30:26.780
I know you're
very close to Harry.

30:26.782 --> 30:28.931
This can't be easy for you.

30:28.933 --> 30:30.506
How come I never heard
of Nola Kellergan before,

30:30.508 --> 30:32.694
all the time
I've been coming here?

30:32.696 --> 30:33.885
Until we found
her corpse,

30:33.887 --> 30:35.690
it was all
ancient history,

30:35.692 --> 30:37.724
the kind that people
don't like to remember.

30:37.726 --> 30:39.107
Well, you were
on the force then, right?

30:39.109 --> 30:40.566
Yeah...

30:40.568 --> 30:44.444
and, uh, Mrs. Cooper
used to call us a lot back then

30:44.446 --> 30:47.210
about something or other
prowling around her place.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.822
She'd get spooked

30:48.824 --> 30:50.744
living in such an
isolated part of town.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.699
<i>Now, I'd only been on the job
for less than a year</i>

30:53.701 --> 30:54.774
<i>the night she called.</i>

30:54.776 --> 30:56.463
<i>You know, a real rookie.</i>

30:56.465 --> 30:58.422
<i>I was the only officer
on patrol in Sommerdale</i>

30:58.424 --> 30:59.612
<i>at the time,</i>

30:59.614 --> 31:01.455
<i>so I went to her house
immediately.</i>

31:01.457 --> 31:03.184
I'm glad
you're here.

31:03.186 --> 31:04.681
What's going on?

31:04.683 --> 31:06.486
<i>Now, she said
that she'd seen a young girl</i>

31:06.488 --> 31:08.445
<i>wearing a red dress</i>

31:08.447 --> 31:10.288
<i>being chased by a man
into the forest,</i>

31:10.290 --> 31:12.784
<i>so, you know,</i>

31:12.786 --> 31:15.664
<i>I searched the area
where she'd seen the girl,</i>

31:15.666 --> 31:19.428
<i>and I found a torn scrap
of red fabric.</i>

31:21.502 --> 31:23.075
<i>So I called Chief Pratt,</i>

31:23.077 --> 31:25.149
<i>who was Sommerdale's
Chief of Police at the time.</i>

31:25.151 --> 31:29.835
<i>He'd just gone off duty,
but he came right away.</i>

31:31.218 --> 31:32.943
Come with me.

31:32.945 --> 31:35.862
I saw blood,
blonde hair...

31:35.864 --> 31:36.937
<i>It was getting dark.</i>

31:36.939 --> 31:39.664
<i>We found strands
of blonde hair,</i>

31:39.666 --> 31:42.198
<i>another piece of the red dress,</i>

31:42.200 --> 31:44.465
<i>and traces of blood.</i>

31:55.179 --> 31:56.943
<i>Then, suddenly,
we hear a gunshot</i>

31:56.945 --> 31:58.866
<i>coming from
Mrs. Cooper's house.</i>

32:11.077 --> 32:12.802
Afterwards, we found out

32:12.804 --> 32:15.146
that Mrs. Cooper had
called the station again

32:15.148 --> 32:16.413
while we were in the forest

32:16.415 --> 32:18.601
to say that the girl
she'd seen earlier

32:18.603 --> 32:20.828
had come to her house
to take refuge.

32:20.830 --> 32:24.399
She was covered in blood
and needed help,

32:24.401 --> 32:26.434
so all available units
from the area were called in

32:26.436 --> 32:27.664
to assist in the search.

32:27.666 --> 32:29.891
<i>We'd have dug up
the whole countryside</i>

32:29.893 --> 32:31.734
<i>if we could've,
but, you know,</i>

32:31.736 --> 32:34.115
<i>we hit one dead end
after another.</i>

32:34.117 --> 32:36.150
<i>After a while, the bigwigs
in the state police said</i>

32:36.152 --> 32:38.531
<i>it was all costing too much,</i>

32:38.533 --> 32:41.373
<i>and felt that continuing
the search was pointless, so...</i>

32:41.375 --> 32:42.255
This is insane.

32:42.257 --> 32:44.175
But you guys,
you guys know Harry.

32:44.177 --> 32:46.597
He couldn't have done
something like this.

32:47.826 --> 32:51.049
If I've learned
one thing as a cop,

32:51.051 --> 32:55.275
it's that you never know
what people are capable of.

32:55.942 --> 32:58.474
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't
answer that at this time.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.279
Let's see how
the investigation unfolds.

33:00.281 --> 33:01.584
Why would I tell you
my strategy?

33:01.586 --> 33:02.583
Quebert's manuscript was
found with the body...

33:02.585 --> 33:05.310
The manuscript
doesn't prove a thing!

33:05.312 --> 33:08.074
Writing isn't killing!
Write that down.

33:08.076 --> 33:08.880
Even your writing.

33:08.882 --> 33:10.877
Excuse me, guys.
Sorry.

33:13.221 --> 33:14.909
- I... I...
- No comment! No comment!

33:14.911 --> 33:17.789
He's got no comment!

33:17.791 --> 33:19.402
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen!

33:19.404 --> 33:20.861
Thank you!

33:20.863 --> 33:22.436
Now, listen to me!

33:22.438 --> 33:25.393
I got two words for you:
"Shut the fuck up!"

33:25.395 --> 33:26.890
The slightest thing
you say can...

33:26.892 --> 33:28.272
can be used against us

33:28.274 --> 33:29.270
and ruin my defense.

33:29.272 --> 33:30.384
What is
your defense?

33:30.386 --> 33:32.227
Deny, deny, deny!

33:32.229 --> 33:33.341
The relationship,

33:33.343 --> 33:34.724
the kidnappings, the murder.

33:34.726 --> 33:36.490
It's all circumstantial.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.563
We're gonna plead not guilty,

33:38.565 --> 33:39.908
Harry's gonna get acquitted,

33:39.910 --> 33:42.365
and I'm gonna counter-sue
for millions of dollars.

33:42.367 --> 33:44.287
Yup?

33:44.940 --> 33:45.859
Thanks, man.

33:45.861 --> 33:48.125
Talk to the nice
townsfolk.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.968
Those hicks are
potential witnesses.

33:49.970 --> 33:51.658
Find out who's got
a drinking problem,

33:51.660 --> 33:53.655
who beats his wife,
who owes money,

33:53.657 --> 33:55.729
because a witness
who drinks

33:55.731 --> 33:56.765
or beats his wife

33:56.767 --> 33:58.301
is not
a credible witness.

33:58.303 --> 33:59.683
Find all the dirt
you can.

34:01.298 --> 34:02.103
A bit of a despicable
approach,

34:02.105 --> 34:03.216
don't you think?

34:03.218 --> 34:05.098
You want your best friend
to go free?

34:06.252 --> 34:07.095
Roth. Go.

34:07.097 --> 34:09.016
<i>CNN called.</i>

34:10.360 --> 34:12.281
Holy shit...

34:12.588 --> 34:14.735
Oh, my God.

34:14.737 --> 34:16.349
Hey, we're gonna
get you out of here.

34:16.351 --> 34:17.847
Okay?

34:17.849 --> 34:19.768
Yeah, it's just...

34:21.496 --> 34:23.223
Don't show it to Roth.

34:23.225 --> 34:24.335
Yeah.

34:24.338 --> 34:26.255
It's going to be
okay, Harry, okay?

34:26.257 --> 34:27.178
Well, I've been
watching the news.

34:27.179 --> 34:28.675
I know what they're saying.

34:28.677 --> 34:30.556
My career is over,
my life is over.

34:30.559 --> 34:32.746
It's the big fall.
I am falling.

34:32.748 --> 34:35.088
Yeah, well, you know,
a wise man once told me

34:35.090 --> 34:36.777
that you should never
be afraid of falling.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.007
Yeah, not so wise
after all,

34:38.009 --> 34:39.158
but thank you for coming.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.119
Yeah, of course,
of course.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.539
I'm staying
at Goose Cove.

34:41.541 --> 34:44.304
Right?
I fed the seagulls.

34:44.306 --> 34:46.033
You should go back to New York.

34:46.034 --> 34:47.645
Look, Roth is gonna
get you off, okay?

34:47.647 --> 34:48.835
But until he does,

34:48.837 --> 34:50.487
I'm gonna stay and do
whatever I can to help.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.677
What about your novel?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.329
Don't worry
about the novel.

34:53.331 --> 34:56.822
Listen, what you said
on the phone when you called me?

34:56.824 --> 34:58.474
You asked
what you had done to Nola.

34:58.476 --> 35:00.548
You said it was
your fault.

35:00.550 --> 35:03.697
Yeah, well, it was just
the emotion, and...

35:03.699 --> 35:07.229
and you were the only one
who knew about Nola, so I...

35:07.231 --> 35:09.801
All right, look, a lot of...
a lot of rage,

35:09.803 --> 35:11.530
and innuendo,

35:11.532 --> 35:14.103
but... no hard evidence

35:14.105 --> 35:16.752
that directly implicates you
in the girl's murder.

35:16.754 --> 35:18.674
Yet.

35:19.596 --> 35:21.821
I don't like
surprises.

35:21.823 --> 35:24.548
Is there anything
that you haven't told me

35:24.550 --> 35:25.700
about you and Nola?

35:25.702 --> 35:28.004
Because I need
to know everything

35:28.006 --> 35:29.616
if I'm gonna
represent you properly.

35:29.618 --> 35:31.344
Mm-hmm.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.341
The police asked me
what I was doing

35:33.343 --> 35:37.143
the evening of... August 30th.

35:37.145 --> 35:38.487
I told them
I was out of town,

35:38.489 --> 35:40.524
I was in Boston.

35:41.638 --> 35:42.711
I wasn't.

35:42.713 --> 35:46.090
I was in a motel
off of Shore Road,

35:46.092 --> 35:48.012
<i>the By the Sea Motel.</i>

35:51.276 --> 35:54.077
By 9:00,
she hadn't arrived.

35:54.079 --> 35:54.999
That was unlike her,

35:55.001 --> 35:56.920
because she was
always on time.

35:58.725 --> 36:00.950
<i>"Room 8 at 8:00.</i>

36:00.952 --> 36:02.679
<i>Then away forever.</i>

36:02.681 --> 36:04.601
<i>Love, N."</i>

36:08.018 --> 36:09.744
I don't know what time
I fell asleep waiting for her,

36:09.746 --> 36:13.123
but I woke up to the radio,

36:13.125 --> 36:15.120
and that's when I...

36:15.122 --> 36:18.499
I found out she was missing.

36:18.501 --> 36:21.610
She was wearing her red dress.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.108
She wore that for me.

36:23.110 --> 36:25.142
It was her favorite dress.

36:25.144 --> 36:26.755
<i>Good morning! It's 6:30,</i>

36:26.757 --> 36:29.751
<i>and the forecast is sunny
for this Sunday, August 31st.</i>

36:29.753 --> 36:32.016
<i>And now, an urgent report.</i>

36:32.018 --> 36:33.668
<i>Police issued a general alert</i>

36:33.670 --> 36:35.203
<i>in the Sommerdale region</i>

36:35.205 --> 36:38.199
<i>after the disappearance
of 15-year-old Nola Kellergan</i>

36:38.201 --> 36:40.848
<i>yesterday evening
around 7:00 p.m.</i>

36:40.850 --> 36:42.231
<i>Police would like to hear
from anyone</i>

36:42.233 --> 36:44.228
<i>with information about
the girl's whereabouts.</i>

36:44.230 --> 36:45.687
<i>At the time she disappeared,</i>

36:45.689 --> 36:47.685
<i>Nola Kellergan
was wearing a red dress.</i>

36:49.836 --> 36:52.099
So, you were meeting.

36:52.101 --> 36:54.021
You were meeting to...

36:54.943 --> 36:56.785
We were gonna leave town.

36:56.787 --> 36:59.088
Okay...

36:59.090 --> 37:00.279
and that's why

37:00.281 --> 37:02.508
you said it was
your fault?

37:03.851 --> 37:05.309
Mm-hmm.

37:05.311 --> 37:07.690
I know
how it looks,

37:07.692 --> 37:09.763
but I didn't
kill Nola.

37:09.765 --> 37:10.685
I loved her,

37:10.687 --> 37:11.837
and if I hadn't
have asked her

37:11.839 --> 37:13.027
to meet me
at that motel,

37:13.029 --> 37:14.949
she might still
be alive today.

37:21.170 --> 37:23.090
I don't think
you get it.

37:24.434 --> 37:26.276
It's a fucking disaster.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.696
If the prosecution
gets hold of this,

37:27.698 --> 37:29.657
Harry is screwed.

37:32.537 --> 37:34.457
Ah, shit...

37:42.290 --> 37:44.400
<i>"On my desk,
there's a porcelain pot.</i>

37:44.402 --> 37:46.627
<i>Inside is a key to my locker
at the gym in Montburry,</i>

37:46.629 --> 37:48.087
<i>203.</i>

37:48.089 --> 37:49.392
<i>Everything is in there.</i>

37:49.394 --> 37:50.621
<i>Burn it all.</i>

37:50.623 --> 37:52.543
<i>I'm in danger."</i>

38:47.416 --> 38:50.871
It's "The Origin of Evil."

38:50.873 --> 38:53.637
It's Harry's
original manuscript.

38:55.097 --> 38:57.094
Holy cow...

39:08.076 --> 39:10.800
<i>I knew
what I was doing was illegal,</i>

39:10.802 --> 39:14.141
<i>that by burning all this
incriminating evidence,</i>

39:14.143 --> 39:17.750
<i>I was suddenly an accomplice.</i>

39:17.752 --> 39:21.322
<i>But I also knew Harry,</i>

39:21.324 --> 39:24.854
<i>and he was my teacher,
my mentor.</i>

39:24.856 --> 39:27.273
<i>He was my friend,</i>

39:27.275 --> 39:29.196
<i>and I had to help him.</i>

39:30.156 --> 39:31.728
<i>There was no way
he could have done</i>

39:31.730 --> 39:34.956
<i>what he was accused of doing.</i>

39:46.130 --> 39:47.549
<i>Then,</i>

39:47.551 --> 39:51.082
<i>as I watched the flames
turn paper to ash,</i>

39:51.084 --> 39:54.115
<i>a chilling thought
crept over me...</i>

39:54.117 --> 39:58.149
<i>What if I was wrong?</i>

40:09.439 --> 40:11.973
<i>Was I in danger myself?</i>
