WEBVTT

00:07.602 --> 00:09.290
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:10.203 --> 00:11.203
Dad?

00:11.230 --> 00:12.340
I didn't say it enough.

00:12.364 --> 00:13.731
I love you, son.

00:14.127 --> 00:16.438
Dad? Dad! No, no, no!

00:16.844 --> 00:18.562
I woke up thinking about Dad.

00:18.587 --> 00:20.622
I mean, it's coming up on
ten years since he died.

00:21.173 --> 00:23.188
Maybe I'm just feeling
a little lost right now.

00:23.213 --> 00:24.780
I'm worried about him.

00:25.211 --> 00:28.196
I know you idolize the guy,
but he's hurting right now.

00:28.490 --> 00:29.688
So I don't understand.

00:29.713 --> 00:32.671
You think you're-you're
capable of being done?

00:32.934 --> 00:35.125
Look, all I know is that ten years ago,

00:35.150 --> 00:36.852
I hit the ground running hard

00:36.953 --> 00:38.687
and I've been running ever since.

00:38.712 --> 00:40.547
And I feel like maybe I need a...

00:40.572 --> 00:42.506
a little time away to
get some perspective.

00:42.531 --> 00:45.235
Tell the policeman you have
a message for Steve McGarrett.

00:45.368 --> 00:46.935
Tell him my name is Daiyu Mei.

00:47.196 --> 00:48.413
He might not know me,

00:48.438 --> 00:51.006
but he'll be familiar
with my late husband

00:51.074 --> 00:52.407
Wo Fat.

00:52.432 --> 00:55.787
Got a visit from that lawyer
from England this morning.

00:55.812 --> 00:58.113
Why would your
mother send you a cipher?

01:01.227 --> 01:02.160
Yo, yo, you all right?

01:02.185 --> 01:03.285
- Yeah.
- What the hell

01:03.310 --> 01:04.410
just happened in here?

01:04.435 --> 01:05.797
Someone stole the cipher.

01:05.822 --> 01:07.589
I mean, they're gonna be disappointed.

01:08.358 --> 01:10.225
I never put it back in the envelope.

01:13.015 --> 01:15.821
_

01:18.141 --> 01:20.782
_

01:43.266 --> 01:44.869
We can expect
the military transport

01:44.894 --> 01:47.461
to pass through this
valley at some point.

01:48.898 --> 01:51.719
The trace will enable us to
pinpoint an exact location.

01:53.782 --> 01:54.782
Here.

01:55.758 --> 01:58.317
The helicopter will be able to
use the mountainside as cover

01:58.341 --> 02:00.576
until our extraction team moves in.

02:01.732 --> 02:03.799
We take out the lead vehicle first.

02:05.201 --> 02:06.792
The transport carrying your brother

02:06.816 --> 02:08.056
should be middle of the convoy.

02:11.396 --> 02:13.197
This only works if
Commander McGarrett agrees

02:13.222 --> 02:14.566
to let Anton go.

02:15.107 --> 02:17.459
Trust me. He'll agree.

02:17.484 --> 02:19.168
Who are these people, Steve?

02:19.193 --> 02:21.063
I'm not so sure.

02:21.088 --> 02:23.657
I've had people on John
McGarrett, looking into him.

02:23.682 --> 02:27.021
He hasn't spoken to
his son in a long time.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.891
Blood is blood.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.716
I swear to God, I will hunt
you down and I will kill you.

02:36.943 --> 02:38.123
_

02:39.349 --> 02:41.818
_

02:51.748 --> 02:54.255
_

03:02.934 --> 03:04.289
Follow them.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.686
No, no, I understand.
Thank you. Thanks, Duke.

03:42.077 --> 03:44.745
Appreciate it. All right.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.051
Bad news?

03:51.464 --> 03:53.164
Crime lab dusted my house.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.289
Whoever broke in,

03:54.314 --> 03:56.348
they left no prints, no DNA, nothing.

03:56.997 --> 03:59.280
So no way of knowing who
tried to steal the cipher,

03:59.305 --> 04:01.606
but what we do know is,
whatever that code means,

04:01.631 --> 04:04.399
it's worth a hell of a lot to someone.

04:04.424 --> 04:05.868
You know something,
man, I really appreciate

04:05.893 --> 04:08.613
you helping me out like this. I do.

04:08.638 --> 04:09.915
It's nothing a couple of dedicated,

04:09.940 --> 04:11.474
over-the-hill
soldiers can't handle.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.688
Well, here's hoping my guy can deliver.

04:16.713 --> 04:18.914
He's ex-NSA, supercomputer for a brain.

04:18.939 --> 04:21.141
You definitely want him
on your team at a pub quiz.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.593
- All right.
- Honestly,

04:22.618 --> 04:24.263
Marshall Nang is pretty
much the only person

04:24.287 --> 04:26.809
outside of Langley with a
shot at decoding that cipher.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.702
Actually, scratch that.
There is someone else.

04:31.051 --> 04:34.496
A Naval Intelligence officer
I met a couple years back.

04:34.521 --> 04:37.289
Super smart. She'd be
up for the job, too.

04:37.314 --> 04:40.673
- But I-I lost track of her.
- Mm-hmm.

04:41.223 --> 04:42.980
Her name wouldn't be Catherine Rollins,

04:43.005 --> 04:45.173
- would it?
- You know her?

04:48.511 --> 04:49.778
Yeah, I know her, man.

04:49.803 --> 04:51.103
She was my girl.

04:51.128 --> 04:54.184
We were together for a bunch
of years, but, uh, well,

04:54.209 --> 04:55.518
these intelligence
types, they got a habit

04:55.543 --> 04:57.744
of, uh, disappearing on you, you know?

04:57.769 --> 04:59.703
Mm. Sounds like it was serious.

04:59.898 --> 05:02.800
Well, she was the one that got away.

05:02.825 --> 05:04.726
- What are you gonna do?
- Hmm.

05:21.161 --> 05:23.187
I hope your guy's the punctual type.

05:23.212 --> 05:24.700
Oh, he'll be on time.

05:28.231 --> 05:29.488
You okay?

05:30.499 --> 05:31.598
What do you mean?

05:32.075 --> 05:34.476
I mean, I hope I didn't ruin
your day by bringing her up.

05:34.724 --> 05:36.534
- Who, Catherine?
- Yeah.

05:36.559 --> 05:38.629
No, man, I'm good.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.288
Thank you.

05:40.945 --> 05:42.112
Oh, here he is.

05:45.457 --> 05:47.800
One sec. Yeah, Danny, what's up?

05:47.825 --> 05:49.738
Hey, Steve, I got a crazy tail on me

05:49.763 --> 05:52.028
and they are not being discreet at all.

05:53.543 --> 05:55.677
- Where are you? Send me your location.
- I'm traveling east

05:55.702 --> 05:57.803
on Kapiolani, just passed University.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.958
All right, hang tight. We're on the way.

06:06.647 --> 06:08.333
All right, do me a favor and hurry up.

06:08.357 --> 06:09.902
They're all over me, Steve.
They're up my ass, all right?

06:09.926 --> 06:10.859
I just went under the H-1.

06:10.927 --> 06:12.460
Okay, cop-copy that.

06:12.485 --> 06:14.539
Listen to me, we are
headed to you now, okay?

06:14.564 --> 06:16.069
We're on the way, Danny.

06:19.092 --> 06:22.504
Was that gunshots? Hey,
yo, what's going on, Danny?

06:22.529 --> 06:24.897
Danny, talk to me, man!

06:25.219 --> 06:27.387
Danny!

06:31.103 --> 06:32.703
Danny!

06:37.795 --> 06:39.095
Danny!

06:47.852 --> 06:49.252
Danny?!

06:49.277 --> 06:50.859
- Extinguisher, back of my truck.
- Copy.

06:50.884 --> 06:53.156
Danny! Danny!

06:54.832 --> 06:56.800
Danny!

07:00.211 --> 07:01.478
He's not in here.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.648
Hey, boss, what's up?

07:09.687 --> 07:11.639
Hey, Tani, listen to
me. I'm looking at two cameras

07:11.664 --> 07:14.320
here at the intersection
of Kaohu and Mookaula.

07:14.345 --> 07:16.169
I need the last 20 minutes
of footage from them

07:16.194 --> 07:17.767
and any other camera in this area

07:17.792 --> 07:19.132
that can see this intersection, okay?

07:19.157 --> 07:20.984
Yeah, on it. Boss, you seem upset.

07:21.009 --> 07:22.743
- Is everything...
- Danny's been taken.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.289
Wait, what? I got to go,

07:25.314 --> 07:26.429
I'm gonna call you
back. I'll call you back.

07:26.454 --> 07:27.988
All right?

07:28.274 --> 07:29.808
We got to lock this perimeter down.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.467
I want CSU down here dusting this thing

07:31.492 --> 07:32.854
for prints, for DNA,

07:32.879 --> 07:33.879
anything they can find.

07:33.904 --> 07:35.599
Then I want a block by block search

07:35.624 --> 07:37.692
done with every available
officer in this area.

07:37.717 --> 07:39.394
All right? We're looking
for Detective Danny Williams.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.286
You know who he is.
My partner, all right?

07:41.311 --> 07:43.970
We're looking for him. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

07:47.622 --> 07:50.304
Hey, we're pulling up the traffic
cam footage that Steve requested.

07:50.329 --> 07:52.699
It looks like there's at least
two cameras with decent coverage

07:52.724 --> 07:54.299
on the spot that Danny was taken.

07:54.324 --> 07:55.576
All right, go back to 30 minutes ago

07:55.601 --> 07:57.052
and scrub forward from there.

07:58.568 --> 07:59.947
Why would someone

07:59.972 --> 08:01.416
- grab Danny like this?
- Could be blowback

08:01.440 --> 08:03.241
from a case he worked,
either with Five-O

08:03.266 --> 08:05.240
or from when he was with HPD.

08:05.265 --> 08:06.876
Whatever the case may
be, whoever took Danny

08:06.901 --> 08:08.528
wanted to keep him alive.

08:08.553 --> 08:11.321
So until we find hard
evidence to the contrary,

08:11.431 --> 08:13.849
we're gonna treat
this like a kidnapping.

08:13.874 --> 08:15.141
Nothing more.

08:16.484 --> 08:18.302
- Hey, guys, any news?
- Yeah.

08:18.327 --> 08:20.755
Cops are searching the
area. So far, nothing.

08:20.780 --> 08:23.349
Where are we at with the footage?

08:23.374 --> 08:24.638
There.

08:29.422 --> 08:30.522
Oh, my God.

08:36.674 --> 08:38.174
Tani, run those plates.

08:40.845 --> 08:42.559
Both plates are coming
back to stolen vehicles.

08:42.859 --> 08:44.102
Let's get up on the phones, all right?

08:44.128 --> 08:45.228
Everybody here

08:45.512 --> 08:46.546
and HPD.

08:46.858 --> 08:48.058
If we get that ransom call,

08:48.083 --> 08:50.083
we got to get that trace
up and running right away.

09:02.152 --> 09:03.763
You. It figures.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.400
You know, after what
you guys did to my car,

09:06.425 --> 09:09.060
I feel like we should probably
exchange insurance information.

09:12.783 --> 09:14.718
A man with two children

09:15.161 --> 09:17.349
should not be making jokes.

09:19.108 --> 09:22.043
You touch my kids and I'll
kill you, you understand?

09:22.068 --> 09:24.502
I'll find you and I'll kill you.

09:27.669 --> 09:28.774
Hey.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.567
We knitted together the traffic footage.

09:30.592 --> 09:32.263
We were able to track the two SUVs

09:32.288 --> 09:33.532
from the spot that Danny was grabbed.

09:33.557 --> 09:34.634
It looks like they're heading east.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.048
Unfortunately, after about a mile,

09:36.073 --> 09:37.274
we ran out of camera coverage.

09:37.299 --> 09:40.271
Tell HPD I want birds in the air.
I want every available officer,

09:40.296 --> 09:42.664
and I mean every single
person who has a badge

09:42.689 --> 09:44.624
on this island looking
for Danny Williams.

09:45.349 --> 09:46.750
Hello?

09:46.775 --> 09:49.341
It's good to finally
hear your voice, Commander.

09:51.722 --> 09:54.240
- Who is this?
- My name is Daiyu Mei.

09:55.076 --> 09:58.154
I believe you knew my husband, Wo Fat.

10:02.207 --> 10:04.008
Do you have Danny?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.133
Correct.

10:05.502 --> 10:06.979
In fact, it seems we each have something

10:07.004 --> 10:08.872
that the other person wants.

10:08.897 --> 10:10.365
I have the person that you care about

10:10.390 --> 10:11.628
most in the world,

10:11.653 --> 10:13.921
and you have something
that is rightfully mine.

10:14.263 --> 10:16.302
What do I-what do I have?
What do I have that's yours?

10:16.327 --> 10:17.428
The cipher.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.536
Deliver it to me and
Detective Williams lives.

10:19.561 --> 10:21.591
And... don't insult me

10:21.616 --> 10:23.884
by pretending you don't
know what I'm talking about.

10:23.966 --> 10:27.161
- Assume I know everything.
- How do I know he's okay?

10:28.856 --> 10:30.633
Say hello to your friends,
Detective Williams.

10:30.658 --> 10:31.936
They're concerned for your safety.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.328
Whatever she wants you
to do, Steve, don't do it,

10:34.353 --> 10:35.615
- okay?
- Oh, God.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.927
Don't give her anything.

10:38.299 --> 10:40.029
So, do we have a deal?

10:40.591 --> 10:42.603
Don't make the same mistake

10:42.670 --> 10:45.305
you made with your father,
Commander McGarrett.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.118
Don't allow a loved one to die
because of your stubbornness.

10:53.227 --> 10:55.242
Tell me where you
want the trade to go down.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.835
I'll text you the information.

10:57.813 --> 10:59.470
Come alone, Commander.

10:59.781 --> 11:01.563
Do exactly as I ask...

11:02.074 --> 11:04.108
or your friend dies.

11:10.477 --> 11:13.156
You're not just gonna give
her what she wants, are you?

11:13.181 --> 11:14.692
Listen, I made the mistake of hesitating

11:14.717 --> 11:16.118
when Hector demanded Lincoln.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.588
Almost cost us two
lives. You remember that?

11:17.613 --> 11:18.933
I'm not making that mistake again.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.469
Look, you seem to be
forgetting, that situation

11:20.494 --> 11:23.000
worked out just fine... we
got the woman and her son back.

11:23.025 --> 11:25.468
Yeah, we got the woman and her
son back because of Lincoln.

11:25.493 --> 11:27.037
Not me. Now, giving Daiyu
Mei what she wants...

11:27.062 --> 11:29.593
Trading this cipher for Danny's life...

11:29.618 --> 11:30.885
That's it, that's all I got.

11:30.910 --> 11:32.143
- That's the play.
- Okay.

11:32.168 --> 11:34.398
What she told you back
there about your father?

11:34.712 --> 11:36.657
There's no way you could
have saved him, okay?

11:36.682 --> 11:38.293
The odds were stacked
against you that day.

11:38.318 --> 11:39.718
But right now...

11:39.743 --> 11:41.644
Right now you've got
Five-O in your corner.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.626
And it wasn't long ago you
told me that very thing.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.212
Let us help you find another way.

11:47.669 --> 11:48.692
All right?

11:48.717 --> 11:51.706
There is no guarantee that even
if you give her that cipher,

11:51.731 --> 11:53.766
she'll spare Danny's life.

11:56.656 --> 11:58.332
I'm going to the trade alone.

12:01.457 --> 12:03.155
I'll call you.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.223
Good luck, brother.

12:17.232 --> 12:18.818
My brother's dead.

12:19.309 --> 12:20.577
Isn't he?

12:20.602 --> 12:23.449
- Victor, listen...
- Isn't he?

12:27.628 --> 12:29.109
And so's your father.

12:30.836 --> 12:32.613
No!

13:04.646 --> 13:05.820
Where is he?

13:06.128 --> 13:07.898
2342 Kapule Avenue.

13:07.923 --> 13:09.718
- You'll find him there.
- No.

13:09.743 --> 13:11.544
Doesn't work for me.

13:11.753 --> 13:13.298
You're gonna livestream
him from my phone.

13:13.322 --> 13:15.366
I want the geostat data to
prove he's where you say he is,

13:15.390 --> 13:18.023
and he's alive. Otherwise
there's no deal, all right?

13:28.984 --> 13:30.093
Danny.

13:30.118 --> 13:31.339
Danny! You okay? Hey!

13:31.364 --> 13:33.750
I'm fine, Steve. Don't trust her, okay?

13:34.637 --> 13:35.704
Hey!

13:37.402 --> 13:39.003
Now give me the cipher.

13:45.168 --> 13:46.632
Good decision.

13:51.336 --> 13:54.236
You know, I wouldn't put
that phone away if I was you.

13:54.269 --> 13:56.336
I'd actually probably call your family.

13:57.434 --> 13:59.268
Tell 'em you love 'em.

13:59.293 --> 14:02.028
You really have no idea
what you stirred up.

14:11.148 --> 14:12.823
Tani, yeah, it's me.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.482
Listen, I need an all-units alert.

14:14.530 --> 14:17.933
Send HPD SWAT to 2342 Kapule Avenue.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.369
Tell them that's where
they're holding Danny.

14:19.394 --> 14:21.306
I-I'm five minutes out, right?
You tell them that, okay?

14:21.331 --> 14:23.165
You got it.

14:25.861 --> 14:27.194
McGarrett's on his way.

14:27.543 --> 14:29.644
Make sure he finds a dead man.

15:04.701 --> 15:06.268
Oh!

16:02.022 --> 16:03.710
Danny.

16:03.735 --> 16:05.702
Danny. Hey.

16:05.727 --> 16:07.761
Hey. Hey, there you go.
Okay, all right, buddy.

16:07.872 --> 16:09.940
All right. All right.

16:09.965 --> 16:12.166
Okay. Okay, you keep
groaning, all right?

16:12.191 --> 16:13.751
Come here, put your hand behind my head.

16:13.776 --> 16:15.177
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

16:15.202 --> 16:17.842
One, two, three, come on, come on!

16:20.800 --> 16:22.268
Here we go.

16:22.293 --> 16:23.493
I'm right here.

16:23.783 --> 16:24.950
Door, get the door.

16:30.475 --> 16:31.608
I'll drive!

16:32.168 --> 16:33.162
Okay, climb in.

16:33.187 --> 16:34.701
I need you to climb in, all right?

16:35.056 --> 16:36.490
I'm right behind you, buddy.

16:36.515 --> 16:38.115
Get in. All right.

16:38.226 --> 16:40.071
I got you, I got you.
Pressure pack's inside here.

16:40.095 --> 16:41.028
All right, all right.

16:41.053 --> 16:42.987
All right, go!

16:43.097 --> 16:46.231
This is Commander Steve
McGarrett of the Five-O Task Force.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.388
I got a patient coming
in. GSW to the chest.

16:48.413 --> 16:50.648
All right? I need surgeons
prepped and ready for him

16:50.673 --> 16:52.332
when I get there. I'm
bringing him in myself.

16:52.357 --> 16:55.026
All right? Yes, good. Go, go, go.

16:56.525 --> 16:58.393
You're good, buddy.

17:00.902 --> 17:02.535
Uh, GSW to the chest.

17:03.027 --> 17:05.386
In and out of consciousness.
His pulse is thready.

17:05.411 --> 17:07.430
Let's get two IV lines,
run them wide open.

17:07.454 --> 17:09.890
Infuse two units O negative.
All right? Let's go.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.167
Hey, I'm with you, bud. It's okay.

17:13.886 --> 17:16.050
I'm sorry, Commander,
you need to wait here.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.454
You want to take somebody...

18:03.824 --> 18:05.207
take me.

18:05.973 --> 18:07.770
Not him, you take me.

18:24.287 --> 18:27.813
No news. He's still in surgery.

18:31.858 --> 18:34.353
Look, Steve, I know you know this.

18:34.601 --> 18:37.002
But we need to get that cipher decoded.

18:37.968 --> 18:39.201
We have a photo of it.

18:39.226 --> 18:41.131
With any luck, my guy can crack it.

18:44.381 --> 18:46.032
What difference does it make?

18:46.264 --> 18:48.514
Well, I'll tell you
what difference it makes.

18:49.037 --> 18:52.071
We crack that cipher, we figure
out why Daiyu Mei wanted it.

18:52.459 --> 18:54.383
Maybe we learn what
she's got planned next.

18:54.408 --> 18:56.459
It's our best chance at catching her.

18:57.865 --> 18:59.745
Look, all I'm asking
is for your permission

18:59.770 --> 19:02.758
to take that cipher to Nang.
You stay put right here.

19:02.783 --> 19:04.116
I got this.

19:11.368 --> 19:12.667
Take Quinn with you.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.228
She's gonna give you a hard time,

19:15.253 --> 19:16.939
tell you she wants to
stay here and support me,

19:16.964 --> 19:18.128
but you tell her...

19:19.448 --> 19:21.567
the best way to do that
is for her to help you.

19:21.592 --> 19:22.859
All right?

19:23.610 --> 19:25.128
Copy that.

19:27.703 --> 19:28.703
Hey.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.024
Nang.

19:47.112 --> 19:48.861
Thought you said this
guy was expecting you.

19:49.312 --> 19:50.712
I'll check around back.

19:52.388 --> 19:54.190
That was very McGarrett of you.

19:58.851 --> 20:00.830
- Clear.
- Kitchen.

20:06.486 --> 20:08.432
- Got blood.
- And drag marks.

20:09.361 --> 20:10.682
This way.

20:13.869 --> 20:15.211
Car's gone.

20:15.236 --> 20:17.256
Blood trail stops
here on the passenger side.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.259
Someone put him in his own
car and drove off with him.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.934
Good news is it's an electric vehicle.

20:23.252 --> 20:25.498
Car like this is
definitely gonna have GPS.

20:25.523 --> 20:27.658
With any luck, we can track it.

20:35.471 --> 20:37.753
Why is this taking so long?

20:37.778 --> 20:40.166
They haven't given us any
news yet or is it a good sign?

20:42.195 --> 20:44.196
I know this is hard.

20:45.197 --> 20:47.119
But it's all in God's hands now.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.455
The only thing we can
do is be here for Danny

20:49.480 --> 20:50.650
and pray for him.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.807
Come on, chin up, kiddo.
It's gonna be all right.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.540
Hey.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.750
How's, uh... What's going on?

21:00.197 --> 21:02.868
He just got out of surgery
and he's stable for now.

21:03.631 --> 21:04.765
Okay.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.673
We're not entirely out of the woods yet,

21:07.698 --> 21:09.198
but we just cleared a big hurdle.

21:09.545 --> 21:11.953
All right, can I-can
I, uh, can I see him?

21:11.978 --> 21:14.347
- Yeah. Come.
- Okay.

22:14.915 --> 22:19.608
_

22:24.309 --> 22:26.522
- Nang's car's pinging here?
- Yeah.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.218
It's okay, buddy.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.772
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You see that, Quinn?

22:39.797 --> 22:42.110
He's got blood on him.
It's okay, buddy, come here.

22:42.135 --> 22:44.737
Here, boy, come on, come on. Come here.

22:44.762 --> 22:46.396
Yeah, it's okay.

22:46.685 --> 22:50.555
It's all good. This guy isn't
injured. So that's not his blood?

22:52.023 --> 22:53.624
No, but it's fresh.

23:08.102 --> 23:09.608
Over here.

23:13.712 --> 23:15.288
Looks like he worked here.

23:16.339 --> 23:17.606
Moving.

23:29.255 --> 23:31.023
I think we found Nang.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.694
Hey, Quinn, what's up?

23:33.719 --> 23:35.931
- Heard Danny's out of surgery.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.356
It's early, you know,

23:37.381 --> 23:38.615
but all signs are positive.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.160
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
that's where the good news ends.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.505
The contact McGarrett and I
were set to meet this morning,

23:43.530 --> 23:44.864
Marshall Nang... he's dead.

23:44.931 --> 23:46.131
What?

23:46.242 --> 23:47.929
Someone grabbed him from his house.

23:47.954 --> 23:50.233
We tracked his car to a junkyard
where it had been crushed.

23:50.258 --> 23:51.279
His body was inside.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.738
And Nang was the only person

23:52.763 --> 23:54.968
on the island with the know-how
to crack that cipher.

23:54.993 --> 23:57.176
Now, if Daiyu Mei figured
that out somehow...

23:57.201 --> 23:59.054
She forced him to crack the
cipher and then killed him

23:59.079 --> 24:01.327
- for his trouble.
- Well, if that's true,

24:01.352 --> 24:02.692
she ain't gonna be here much longer.

24:03.530 --> 24:04.884
I got an idea.

24:04.994 --> 24:06.962
Whatever it is... I
don't care what it is...

24:06.987 --> 24:09.452
Just do it, okay? We're
almost out of time.

24:13.921 --> 24:15.335
Hi.

24:16.508 --> 24:19.510
- Hey.
- Why'd you stop holding my hand?

24:23.101 --> 24:24.737
We're fighting?

24:25.890 --> 24:27.358
Buddy...

24:28.108 --> 24:29.522
I, uh...

24:30.486 --> 24:33.479
- I thought I lost you there, man.
- Nah.

24:33.504 --> 24:36.288
No, you can't get rid of
me that easy. All right?

24:38.527 --> 24:40.061
You know, when a patient wakes up,

24:40.086 --> 24:41.854
you're supposed to be relieved.

24:41.984 --> 24:44.390
At least act happy, a little bit.

24:45.538 --> 24:46.859
I'm happy.

24:46.927 --> 24:47.960
Yeah?

24:49.148 --> 24:50.815
Yeah, me too.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.912
She used you

24:56.937 --> 24:58.257
to get at me.

24:58.702 --> 25:00.315
She almost killed you.

25:00.663 --> 25:02.749
Eh, she didn't. I'm
right here, I'm chillin'.

25:03.079 --> 25:05.080
Yeah. It's just...

25:07.085 --> 25:08.747
It feels an awful lot like

25:08.772 --> 25:10.383
what I went through with
my father, that's all.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.355
Stop, please. You're
annoying me already.

25:14.205 --> 25:16.741
If I had a dollar for every
time you saved my life...

25:17.465 --> 25:18.668
I'd have, like, 20 bucks
or something like...

25:18.701 --> 25:20.666
You-You'd have a lot
more than that, actually.

25:20.694 --> 25:22.461
- 25 bucks.
- Yeah.

25:25.575 --> 25:26.708
Hey, I'm sorry, it's Cole.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.202
Want me to take it outside?

25:28.227 --> 25:29.705
Go ahead, answer it. Put it on speaker,

25:29.730 --> 25:30.997
would you? I'm bored.

25:32.913 --> 25:34.406
Yeah, Cole, go ahead.

25:34.474 --> 25:35.674
Steve, we cracked it.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.929
It's called a ADFGVX cipher.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.555
The Germans were the first
to use it during World War I.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.348
The code your mother
sent were coordinates

25:42.373 --> 25:44.125
for a cemetery on the island.

25:44.150 --> 25:45.618
We're sending you the location now.

25:46.596 --> 25:47.829
Okay.

25:48.244 --> 25:49.411
Oh, my God.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.666
What is it?

25:51.691 --> 25:53.525
I know this place. I know this place.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.027
My-my dad used to take me here.

25:55.052 --> 25:56.983
It's where we thought my mom was buried.

25:58.358 --> 25:59.708
Go. Go, go, go.

25:59.733 --> 26:01.200
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:01.267 --> 26:02.301
Go on.

26:06.916 --> 26:08.350
Hey.

26:08.812 --> 26:11.847
This way. Family mausoleum's down here.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.694
This was my mother's crypt.

26:17.984 --> 26:19.632
Someone took your mom's body?

26:20.194 --> 26:23.088
No. No, I mean, this
crypt was assigned to her

26:23.113 --> 26:24.913
after she faked her death.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.160
Anyway,
I always thought it was empty, uh,

26:28.185 --> 26:29.772
I guess I was wrong.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.741
Your mother must have hidden
something inside of it.

26:32.679 --> 26:34.458
That's why she sent you the cipher.

26:34.483 --> 26:36.349
She wanted you to
find it after she died.

26:36.374 --> 26:38.530
- Right.
- Well, whatever it was,

26:38.563 --> 26:40.616
it looks like Daiyu Mei's got it now.

26:51.156 --> 26:54.523
According to the time code, this
happened less than an hour ago.

26:54.548 --> 26:56.282
Can you push in on that?

27:01.585 --> 27:04.171
- That's a lot of cash.
- Yeah. My, uh,

27:04.196 --> 27:06.731
my mother felt like she had
a lot to make up for. It's...

27:07.123 --> 27:08.757
it's a long story.

27:10.451 --> 27:13.515
Hold on. May be able to
run facial rec on this guy.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.022
Roland Wu. He's got a bunch of priors.

27:20.047 --> 27:21.448
Did two separate bids at Halawa.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.192
Okay, let's run a trace on his phone.

27:23.217 --> 27:25.000
We need to figure out
where they're headed.

27:29.561 --> 27:32.069
_

27:37.493 --> 27:39.293
Okay, on me.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.061
She's moving.

28:21.314 --> 28:23.218
I'm following, cover me.

29:38.734 --> 29:40.812
Hands up! It's over!

29:44.557 --> 29:45.891
Aah!

30:02.672 --> 30:03.672
Don't move.

30:03.697 --> 30:06.499
Don't move. Put that
gun down. Right now.

30:08.414 --> 30:09.414
Put it down!

30:17.691 --> 30:18.921
All this.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.919
All this, for what, for what... money?

30:21.104 --> 30:23.039
- For killing my husband.
- Your husband

30:23.064 --> 30:24.859
didn't give me any choice.

30:24.961 --> 30:27.062
Wo Fat had every right
to that inheritance.

30:27.843 --> 30:29.842
After all, he was Doris' son, too.

30:29.867 --> 30:30.809
No, he wasn't.

30:31.132 --> 30:33.102
He wasn't. He was her charity case.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.571
If he was her son, if he was her blood,

30:36.295 --> 30:39.297
he would never have ordered
the execution of my father.

30:43.084 --> 30:44.451
Go on.

30:45.205 --> 30:46.705
Pull the trigger.

30:53.359 --> 30:55.391
You have your father's will.

30:56.710 --> 30:57.802
My husband said he'd never met

30:57.827 --> 30:59.795
a more principled man.

31:00.011 --> 31:01.952
Wo Fat never met my father.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.601
Not in person.

31:12.642 --> 31:15.921
Your son... has something I want.

31:16.726 --> 31:18.468
If he gives it to me, you go free.

31:18.827 --> 31:21.829
But if he doesn't, you die.

31:24.937 --> 31:26.431
I have the father.

31:26.933 --> 31:28.167
Let me talk to him.

31:29.906 --> 31:32.374
My apologies, Mr. McGarrett,

31:32.399 --> 31:33.963
for the rude introduction.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.210
I hope it's the worst thing
that happens to you today.

31:37.835 --> 31:39.401
But that depends on your son

31:39.867 --> 31:41.401
cooperating with us.

31:41.426 --> 31:42.526
Who is this?

31:43.388 --> 31:45.923
I am the son of Doris McGarrett.

31:48.335 --> 31:49.958
You don't seem surprised.

31:50.925 --> 31:53.105
You suspected that her death was staged,

31:53.130 --> 31:54.147
didn't you?

31:54.435 --> 31:56.091
I was looking into it.

31:56.425 --> 31:59.373
Then I hope our conversation
has brought you some peace.

32:01.591 --> 32:03.380
Whatever happens next...

32:04.805 --> 32:06.139
don't tell my son.

32:07.894 --> 32:09.895
It would be too hard on him.

32:10.809 --> 32:13.377
You're a good man, John McGarrett.

32:14.091 --> 32:16.099
Let's hope your son feels
the same protectiveness

32:16.124 --> 32:17.229
towards you.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.876
You are your father.

32:33.379 --> 32:34.512
You good?

32:39.517 --> 32:40.963
Yeah.

32:44.006 --> 32:45.307
Book her, Cole.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.482
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:15.933 --> 33:16.974
How you feeling?

33:18.730 --> 33:19.797
Depressed.

33:20.033 --> 33:21.834
Depressed? Why you depressed?

33:22.028 --> 33:24.170
You know that lady, the
nice nurse at the hospital?

33:24.195 --> 33:25.295
She was bringing me those

33:25.911 --> 33:28.899
red Jell-Os with the
whipped cream on top?

33:28.924 --> 33:30.925
- Yeah.
- I miss her. She was very nice to me.

33:32.273 --> 33:34.255
Yeah, can I give you a word of advice?

33:35.506 --> 33:37.483
Don't mistake a caregiver
for someone who cares.

33:37.508 --> 33:38.677
She was getting paid to be nice to you.

33:38.702 --> 33:39.869
Oh, really?

33:39.894 --> 33:42.169
You know, jealousy is
not, uh, pretty on you.

33:46.527 --> 33:47.841
You all packed?

33:52.723 --> 33:54.000
I'm gonna just...

33:54.025 --> 33:55.794
say this one more time.

33:55.819 --> 33:57.804
This is Hawaii.

33:57.829 --> 34:00.653
There's beautiful beaches
all over the place.

34:00.678 --> 34:02.624
Plenty of sand. You can
clear your head here.

34:02.649 --> 34:04.107
It's a beautiful place.

34:04.824 --> 34:07.059
- You know what I mean?
- Who are you, man?

34:07.112 --> 34:09.341
- Hmm?
- Ten years ago,

34:09.366 --> 34:10.926
you came out here, you hated this place.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.353
I don't know, man. I blame you.

34:15.379 --> 34:17.310
I blame you for a lot of things.

34:17.335 --> 34:19.902
By the way, I don't
know why you didn't keep

34:19.951 --> 34:21.395
some of that money
that Doris left for you.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.353
You could fly first
class like a gentleman.

34:23.463 --> 34:25.560
First cl... I don't
need to fly first class.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.888
I just need, you know, I
just got to... get on a plane.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.579
What exactly is it
that you're looking for?

34:45.821 --> 34:47.020
Peace.

34:50.415 --> 34:51.770
I mean, look at...

34:52.746 --> 34:54.685
It was my father

34:55.411 --> 34:57.120
that brought me back here...

34:57.188 --> 34:58.455
and that kept me here.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.746
I mean,

34:59.771 --> 35:01.372
he's the reason I stayed here.

35:01.397 --> 35:03.527
I-I just had to figure out

35:03.552 --> 35:05.755
what it was that he was investigating

35:05.780 --> 35:06.942
and then I...

35:08.958 --> 35:10.009
then I learned

35:10.034 --> 35:13.364
that he actually knew my
mother was still alive,

35:13.490 --> 35:15.239
and, uh...

35:16.440 --> 35:17.607
So now what?

35:17.632 --> 35:19.366
You're gonna-you're
gonna walk the earth

35:19.391 --> 35:21.592
like the dude from Kung
Fu, searching for answers?

35:21.617 --> 35:22.717
What-what are you gonna do?

35:23.054 --> 35:24.325
Something like that.

35:29.163 --> 35:31.098
It's gonna be okay, man.
You know that, right?

35:34.461 --> 35:36.141
You know, it doesn't feel
like it's gonna be okay.

35:36.166 --> 35:37.266
It feels like...

35:37.825 --> 35:39.797
my main dude is leaving me.

35:41.032 --> 35:42.727
That's what's happening, you know.

35:43.148 --> 35:44.648
It's not goodbye forever.

35:45.078 --> 35:47.213
Better not be a forever goodbye.

35:47.238 --> 35:48.705
Why would you say that?

35:53.516 --> 35:55.281
You got a phone, right?

35:57.154 --> 35:58.221
Come on. Come here.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.266
- Gonna make me get up?
- Yeah, get up.

36:04.680 --> 36:05.875
Come on.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.289
All right.

36:21.308 --> 36:22.781
Hey.

36:23.975 --> 36:25.242
I love you, man.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.515
Love you too.

36:35.557 --> 36:37.491
Don't make me come looking for you.

37:05.805 --> 37:07.515
I got a couple things to tell you.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.780
The first one is I love you
and I'm gonna miss you, okay?

37:11.105 --> 37:12.705
Second one is...

37:13.976 --> 37:15.376
look after Danno.

37:15.874 --> 37:17.110
He's gonna need you.

37:24.495 --> 37:25.562
Yo.

37:27.066 --> 37:28.441
Really?

37:29.113 --> 37:30.607
You thought we was gonna just

37:30.632 --> 37:31.875
let you leave without saying goodbye?

37:35.712 --> 37:37.316
Remember that time you saved my life?

37:38.207 --> 37:39.449
Yeah.

37:39.751 --> 37:41.752
No, you don't. You know why?

37:44.361 --> 37:46.241
You saved my life when you met me.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.639
I love you, man.

37:57.421 --> 37:58.788
Love you, man.

38:04.502 --> 38:05.502
Hey.

38:08.923 --> 38:10.880
Thank you for always
seeing the good in me.

38:11.607 --> 38:13.326
You gave me a second
chance at this life.

38:13.393 --> 38:14.527
I'll never forget that.

38:14.841 --> 38:16.411
I'll miss you, brother.

38:19.042 --> 38:20.809
I'll miss you, too.

38:27.288 --> 38:29.466
Oh, my God.

38:29.491 --> 38:31.559
Thank you for everything.

38:31.584 --> 38:33.632
I'm gonna miss you so much.

38:33.657 --> 38:34.819
I'm proud of you, kid.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.509
I can't believe you're going.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.420
Be good.

38:41.703 --> 38:43.137
No.

38:50.184 --> 38:52.898
Thank you so much.

38:52.923 --> 38:54.758
I'm proud of you.

38:55.325 --> 38:57.090
Thank you for believing in me.

39:12.762 --> 39:14.978
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

39:15.372 --> 39:16.355
You're worth it.

39:16.731 --> 39:18.801
And for giving me a family.

39:21.167 --> 39:23.294
I hope you find what you're looking for.

39:44.829 --> 39:46.229
Hoo-yah.

39:46.355 --> 39:47.789
Hoo-yah.

40:08.777 --> 40:10.215
Thank you, man.

40:12.902 --> 40:14.301
Do me a favor.

40:14.942 --> 40:16.372
Hold down the fort for me.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.942
You got it.

40:18.963 --> 40:20.325
All y'all...

40:26.672 --> 40:27.672
Hey.

40:30.457 --> 40:31.950
Aloha.

40:33.755 --> 40:35.201
A Hui hou.

40:35.226 --> 40:36.259
Oh, man.

41:21.607 --> 41:25.465
_

41:34.591 --> 41:36.592
This seat taken?

41:41.509 --> 41:42.843
Catherine...

41:42.868 --> 41:44.551
Hey, sailor.

41:49.171 --> 41:50.458
It was you?

41:51.505 --> 41:52.997
You cracked that cipher.

41:54.755 --> 41:56.072
Mm-hmm.

41:56.182 --> 41:57.816
Lincoln, uh, got ahold of me.

41:57.841 --> 41:59.997
Said you guys needed some help.

42:00.212 --> 42:01.746
So, yeah.

42:03.893 --> 42:04.927
He's a good man.

42:05.359 --> 42:06.492
Well, he must be.

42:06.517 --> 42:08.536
I mean, you gave him
the keys to Danno's car.

42:08.561 --> 42:10.996
Well, I mean, we can't
have Danny Williams

42:11.021 --> 42:12.145
drive his own car.

42:12.170 --> 42:13.614
Like he ever did.

42:16.878 --> 42:17.978
You gonna sit down?

42:40.141 --> 42:41.641
You ready?

42:45.982 --> 42:47.090
Yeah.
