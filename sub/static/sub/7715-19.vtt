Hey, Oscar.
Big <i>Will and Grace</i> fan?

00:08.723 --> 00:11.053
Everybody assumes I am.
I {\*always }get them as gifts.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.434
Dunder Mifflin is having
our first ever garage sale.

00:16.773 --> 00:18.179
Like many Americans,

00:18.476 --> 00:21.092
we realized we had lots of things
we didn't really need.

00:21.217 --> 00:22.606
10 cents of every dollar

00:22.772 --> 00:25.985
is going into the party fund,
so we can throw parties for ourselves.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.154
People, look alive!

00:28.320 --> 00:29.769
It's showtime!

00:29.894 --> 00:32.408
Doors open in three...

00:32.860 --> 00:33.909
two...

00:34.312 --> 00:35.313
one!

00:41.040 --> 00:42.041
Yikes.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.502
It's cold!

00:43.668 --> 00:45.337
Just shut the door.{\*Let people come in the front.}

00:45.503 --> 00:46.839
It's good that it's cold.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.507
It'll drive business inside.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.301
The signs will drive business inside.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.428
The warmth will lure people inside.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.929
{\*Close it. }This is how business...

00:54.095 --> 00:55.431
I'm not closing the door.{\* Close it.}

00:55.597 --> 00:56.849
- Close it.
- Stop it.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.225
Kevin, shut the door.

01:09.381 --> 01:11.989
{\*Looks like s}Someone's sign's a little crooked.

01:12.774 --> 01:14.024
It looks awful.

01:14.815 --> 01:16.118
- {\*You n}Need a thumbtack?
- Sure.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.369
Not so fast.

{\pos(192,230)}Schrutes are farmers by hobby,
and traders by trade.

01:22.231 --> 01:23.964
{\pos(192,230)}Through the art of the swap,

01:24.450 --> 01:26.474
I will walk out of this garage sale

01:26.739 --> 01:28.375
with the finest item here.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.133
{\pos(192,230)}I will trade you for the used candle.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.301
Forget you.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.860
Come on, it's trash.

01:33.985 --> 01:36.347
Like your sign, unless you have this.

01:38.317 --> 01:39.391
Fine.
Give it.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.265
That's how it's done.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.397
I love her.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.607
How much for that?

01:48.293 --> 01:50.024
{\pos(192,230)}I {\*actually }don't know why I brought that,

01:50.149 --> 01:51.798
{\pos(192,230)}because it's kind of priceless.

01:51.923 --> 01:52.946
Ten dollars.

01:54.191 --> 01:55.908
I paid 500 dollars for that.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.403
- 200.
- 500.

01:57.528 --> 01:58.661
- 20.
- 45.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.454
- Get lost.
- Damn it.

That is how you do it.

02:04.754 --> 02:07.211

{\pos(110,268)}{\*No, you know, i}It's really more for a bachelor pad.
I just want to get a fair price.

02:11.861 --> 02:13.884
We could put it in storage in case.

02:15.043 --> 02:16.779
{\pos(120,268)}In case?
In case of what?

02:17.241 --> 02:18.722
{\pos(120,268)}You know, in case...

02:18.888 --> 02:20.516
{\pos(120,268)}Maybe something changes.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.686
{\pos(120,268)}I don't have an "in case".
Do you have an "in case"?

02:28.277 --> 02:30.151
How much for the slip n' slide?

02:31.299 --> 02:32.300

{\pos(110,268)}Hello, Mr. Flax.
{\*This is }Michael Scott, your daughter's boss.

02:36.379 --> 02:37.479
{\pos(120,268)}I am calling

02:37.829 --> 02:41.116
{\pos(105,268)}because I am going to have
to fire your daughter Holly.

02:41.241 --> 02:43.559
{\pos(120,268)}{\*because s}She's such a terrible employee.

02:43.684 --> 02:45.034
{\pos(120,268)}I'm just kidding.

02:45.508 --> 02:46.530
{\pos(120,268)}I'm kidding.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.362
{\pos(120,268)}I'm actually calling...

02:49.768 --> 02:51.321
{\pos(120,268)}'cause I'm in love with her.

02:51.446 --> 02:54.069
{\pos(120,268)}I love your daughter,
and I have for some time.

02:54.194 --> 02:58.220
{\pos(120,268)}And I would like to discuss
my intentions with you,

02:58.962 --> 03:00.943
{\pos(120,268)}which are to ask her
to marry me.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.137
{\pos(120,268)}I was hoping{\* that}
you'd give me your approval.

03:04.954 --> 03:06.056
{\pos(120,268)}This isn't a joke.

03:06.181 --> 03:08.381
{\pos(120,268)}So call me back
when you get this,

03:08.507 --> 03:10.389
and I look forward to speaking.

03:16.794 --> 03:18.908
Are you serious?
A half-used candle?

03:19.236 --> 03:21.660
{\pos(100,268)}{\*Get out of here.}You're blocking my table
with your giant body.

03:22.293 --> 03:25.706
{\pos(115,268)}Cause there's a huge line of people
who want your spinster tchotchkes.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.000
{\pos(120,268)}Screw you, man.
People like my stuff.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.293
People like Ryan?

03:30.598 --> 03:32.166
{\pos(120,268)}{\*Let me }I'll tell you about men like him.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.842
{\pos(120,268)}He comes over, and you're:
"Hey,{\* baby,} let me light a candle."

03:34.967 --> 03:37.812
{\pos(120,268)}And you pull out this one.
Half-used.

03:37.937 --> 03:40.298
{\pos(120,268)}He's like:
"Who else is she seeing?

03:40.423 --> 03:42.723
"I better lock her down fast."

03:44.818 --> 03:47.937
- {\*You can t}Take my Helen Fielding collection.
- And the Jennifer Weiner collection.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.234
Oh, my gosh.
You have the <i>Dallas</i> board game?

03:54.438 --> 03:56.278
When I was a kid, I was on <i>Dallas</i>.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.613
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.617
{\pos(120,268)}We missed our connecting flight,
and we spent the entire day on <i>Dallas</i>.

04:02.050 --> 04:05.412
{\pos(120,268)}Then we spent a week on <i>Hawaii</i>.
I was on heaven.

04:06.629 --> 04:07.930
We should play it.

04:08.356 --> 04:10.277
Well, there's no instructions.

04:10.402 --> 04:12.628
It's <i>Dallas, the game</i>.
We can figure it out.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.300
I'm pretty good at board games.

04:16.588 --> 04:18.716
- Shall we make it {\*a little }interesting?
- Sure.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.692
What is this?

04:28.011 --> 04:29.812
How did those get out?
I'm sorry.

04:32.290 --> 04:35.234
"Professor Copperfield's
miracle legumes"?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.404
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost.

04:38.798 --> 04:40.448
It was getting dark this{\* one} night,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.364
and{\* out of nowhere,} this guy comes with a cart,

04:42.489 --> 04:43.576
{\*and he's }selling these.

04:44.253 --> 04:47.496
He told me things about me
there's no way he could've known.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.373
That's a common swindler's trick.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.540
Probably.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.002
So I buy some.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.171
I turn the corner.
I feel like an idiot.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.714
So I go get my money back.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.433
He was gone.

04:59.984 --> 05:03.601
So you want to sell me magic beans?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.105
Correction, I do not...

05:07.230 --> 05:10.019
wanna sell you Professor Copperfield's
miracle legumes.

05:10.775 --> 05:12.391
Nice try.
No, correction.

05:12.516 --> 05:13.666
Terrible try.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.934
Michael called dad?

05:20.461 --> 05:22.323
<i>Your friend Michael, yes.
What's going on?</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:27.154
I think I know,
but I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong.

05:27.279 --> 05:28.355
Is dad there?

05:28.745 --> 05:29.976
- <i>Hollis?</i>
- Hi, dad.

05:30.101 --> 05:32.625
<i>There was a program on TV
about India.</i>

05:34.460 --> 05:37.213
- Did you connect with Michael?
- <i>You wanna watch it?</i>

05:38.856 --> 05:40.500
I'm not there, dad.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.795
I'm in Pennsylvania.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.135
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

05:44.306 --> 05:45.370
I live here.

05:46.425 --> 05:48.182
Can I talk to you about Michael?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.686
- <i>I'll put your mother on.</i>
- No, dad.

05:51.964 --> 05:54.716
Mom, dad can't seem
to focus on the subject.

05:54.841 --> 05:56.781
<i>Don't worry about him.
He's got me.</i>

05:56.906 --> 05:59.902
- Well, who do you have?
- <i>I have your father.</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:01.788
<i>He's right here.
I'll put him on.</i>

06:04.550 --> 06:05.845
Which one's decaf?

06:24.531 --> 06:26.846
I'm coming{\* out} to see what you're doing
and maybe stop you.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.641
{\*Oh, you know what? }Do you have a siphon?
I think I'm gonna run out of gas.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.713
- Why do you need more gas?
- Well, I'm...

06:34.870 --> 06:35.896
Writing a message.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.731
Is it a good{\* *message} or a bad message?

06:38.614 --> 06:40.734
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.778
Are you proposing?

06:43.078 --> 06:43.988
Maybe.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.864
{\*You know what?}I've got gas on my hands
and my shoes.

06:48.989 --> 06:50.786
Would you light it?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.913
- Do the honors, please?
- No problem.

06:58.832 --> 07:00.281
Could you light this{\*, please}?

07:01.509 --> 07:03.681
You've had two ideas today.

07:03.806 --> 07:05.406
One of them was great,

07:05.908 --> 07:07.762
and the other one was terrible.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.847
I'm not in the mood for riddles.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.683
- This is terrible.
- No, this is romantic.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.499
{\*You know what?}I'm gonna get a hose,
and then we'll talk about it.

07:15.624 --> 07:16.771
We'll figure it out.

07:17.117 --> 07:19.303
I'll be right back.
Just stay there.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.759
{\pub}Free sample?

07:24.884 --> 07:27.914
My mom makes the best pesto
in the world.

07:28.039 --> 07:29.141
I always tell her:

07:29.266 --> 07:31.251
"You should sell this.
You'd make a fortune."

07:31.376 --> 07:33.382
She always says:
"No, it's just for family."

07:33.507 --> 07:35.986
Well, finally, I was like:
"fuck it, I'll sell it."

07:36.111 --> 07:38.810
So I'm like:
"I need you to make a ton of pesto

07:38.935 --> 07:41.078
"for a pesto party
for all my friends."

07:41.203 --> 07:42.653
She's like: "Okay."

07:43.213 --> 07:44.504
Pesto party?
Really?

07:44.629 --> 07:46.878
Anyway, she makes 100 bottles worth.

07:47.003 --> 07:48.256
It's so good.

07:49.173 --> 07:52.926
And Phyllis
just had that "mom" look I wanted.

07:55.530 --> 07:56.894
You got this kosher certified?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.311
No, I meant like:

07:58.436 --> 08:00.523
"It's cool. It's kosher.
It's all good."

08:01.820 --> 08:03.990
Ryan, you have such
an interesting mind.

08:04.115 --> 08:05.215
So creative.

08:05.484 --> 08:08.906
All these new business ideas
and artistic projects.

08:11.421 --> 08:12.535
What you got there?

08:12.701 --> 08:15.164
It's just Stanley's old photo album.

08:15.289 --> 08:17.556
I was thinking about
throwing it in the garbage.

08:17.681 --> 08:20.037
Why'd I want random black man's
old photo album

08:20.162 --> 08:21.454
sitting on my bookshelf?

08:21.579 --> 08:22.962
I'm not James Franco.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.771
Things are going very well.

08:26.896 --> 08:29.176
I traded a thumbtack
for Meredith's junk,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.429
for Kelly's crap,
for Phyllis's garbage,

08:31.595 --> 08:33.639
for Oscar's trash,
for Stanley's crap,

08:33.804 --> 08:36.100
for Ryan's junk, for Creed's garbage,

08:36.265 --> 08:39.552
for a very cute squid
that Erin happened to have.

08:42.659 --> 08:43.857
Put those away.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.695
{\*`*I'm really s}Sorry.
Pam must have put those out.

08:48.302 --> 08:51.240
{\*All right, j}Just out of curiosity,
what were the claims for those beans?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.979
They're legumes, Dwight.

08:53.104 --> 08:55.119
You're gonna make fun of me,
so why would I?

08:57.704 --> 08:58.858
You know what?

08:58.983 --> 09:00.103
This ends now.

09:11.628 --> 09:13.262
Everyone's in the conference room.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.221
Why?

09:14.767 --> 09:16.015
You called the meeting.

09:16.664 --> 09:17.558
I did?

09:18.735 --> 09:20.332
Thank you all for coming.

09:20.457 --> 09:23.063
I would like to talk
to you today about...

09:23.559 --> 09:24.560
Recycling.

09:25.241 --> 09:27.162
- We are a family.
- I couldn't agree{\* with you} more.

09:27.287 --> 09:29.557
I've always believed
we should all be{\* very} involved

09:29.682 --> 09:31.810
in one another's personal lives
in a{\* very} major way.

09:32.644 --> 09:33.997
So about this proposal{\* thing}.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.160
No, my mind's made up.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.622
I am not going to change my mind.
You can't talk me out of it.

09:41.259 --> 09:42.473
She's perfect for you.

09:42.598 --> 09:44.236
- She's the one.
- She's amazing.

09:44.361 --> 09:45.962
This is very exciting.

09:46.771 --> 09:47.946
So we just...

09:48.071 --> 09:50.013
We want to help you plan the proposal

09:50.138 --> 09:51.401
so that it's safe

09:51.710 --> 09:52.781
and responsible

09:52.906 --> 09:54.470
and realistic and doable.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.755
I had a great idea
until you ruined it.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.129
You want to know how to do it?
Here's how you do it.

09:59.254 --> 10:01.440
Take her out to dinner,
go down on one knee.

10:01.756 --> 10:04.480
If you are in costume,
you did something wrong.

10:04.983 --> 10:08.036
If at any point you find yourself
tying the ring to a dog's collar,

10:08.496 --> 10:10.296
stop and look at yourself.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.282
I'm gon' play me
a little old blackmail card...

10:15.448 --> 10:16.449
Nice.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.212
And call a proxy meeting

10:18.337 --> 10:21.831
and take control of Ewing oil
once and for all.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.451
No, you can't do that.

10:23.576 --> 10:26.020
You can't play a blackmail card

10:26.145 --> 10:28.878
and call a proxy meeting
in the same turn.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.338
Why not?

10:30.668 --> 10:32.995
Seems to me
we're just making up rules

10:33.120 --> 10:35.578
'cause somebody forgot
to staple the rule book

10:35.703 --> 10:38.493
to the inside of the game
like a normal human being.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.683
And I'm gonna play this here
"share the wealth" card.

10:43.141 --> 10:47.009
Which entitles me
to half of both of you all's money.

10:47.134 --> 10:49.108
So if you don't mind...

10:49.274 --> 10:51.514
No, this card is from the wrong game.

10:51.931 --> 10:53.696
This is from the game of life.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.120
- It was in the box.
- Well played.

10:56.489 --> 11:00.161
We must honorably adhere to the rules
that we are making up on the spot.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.745
No, but that's not fair.

11:02.238 --> 11:03.738
Well, that's <i>Dallas</i>.

11:04.903 --> 11:06.825
<i>Dallas</i>, indeed.

11:12.051 --> 11:13.457
Where did you get this{\* picture}?

11:15.380 --> 11:18.179
My mom also makes the best salsa.

11:20.577 --> 11:23.251
- This is your mom's old stuff?
- Yeah, mostly.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.436
How's she doing?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.884
It didn't go down easy,
but she's made some friends,

11:28.009 --> 11:29.732
and it's already better than it was.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.026
How do you know when it's time?

11:32.331 --> 11:33.986
I don't know if you ever know.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.470
And if you wait for the day
when your parent comes to you and says:

11:37.595 --> 11:39.540
"I can't take care of myself",

11:39.665 --> 11:41.365
it's never gonna happen.

11:43.252 --> 11:46.081
I have a box of bras under the table
if you're interested.

11:46.781 --> 11:47.831
Let me see.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.968
I think animals in proposals are out.
Right, Ryan?

11:52.093 --> 11:54.306
Didn't you read in {\*one of }your blogs
that animals are out?

11:54.431 --> 11:56.926
Blogs are out, but people
are texting{\* each other}: "no more animals".

11:57.092 --> 11:58.097
How about this?

11:58.368 --> 12:01.388
I throw a corpse dressed like me
off of the roof.

12:01.706 --> 12:04.366
It hits the ground,
the head pops off.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.924
This leads to me saying the line,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.188
"I lost my head
when I fell in love with you."

12:09.354 --> 12:11.713
- That's a guarantee.
- Easy enough to get a corpse.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.609
{\*You just }Go to a med school.
I {\*already }have the ring.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.544
- Don't think you need the corpse then.
- There's the ring.

12:18.022 --> 12:19.684
Holy shit!
Is that real?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.464
They say, "three years' salary".

12:23.326 --> 12:26.038
- Is she not gonna like that?
- No, she's gonna love it.

12:26.403 --> 12:28.916
So I think
you can keep the proposal simple.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.990
You know, like when Jim proposed,

12:31.115 --> 12:34.459
he got down on one knee,
and he told me that he loved me

12:34.584 --> 12:37.007
and he asked me to marry him,
and it was perfect.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.423
Where was that?

12:38.901 --> 12:40.319
At a gas station.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.763
A gas station?

12:43.115 --> 12:45.933
{\*It was }When she was working in New York,
{\*so }it was halfway between both of us.

12:46.294 --> 12:47.991
That must have been a surprise,

12:48.310 --> 12:51.427
when, at the gas station,
you proposed.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.198
No, it was really...
It was really sweet.

12:54.646 --> 12:55.860
It was raining{\* and}...

12:57.023 --> 13:00.531
You didn't say that the weather was bad.
That sounds perfect.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.206
I want this to be an event

13:04.581 --> 13:08.080
that everyone talks about
always and forever.

13:08.533 --> 13:09.665
Totally reasonable.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.459
I'm just... It's terrifying.

13:12.102 --> 13:13.377
She's not gonna say no.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.796
I know, but I'm still scared.
I don't know why.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.407
'Cause it's a big deal.

13:17.847 --> 13:21.051
I mean, I knew Pam was gonna say yes,
but I was still scared.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.984
- You were scared?
- Yeah, it's scary.

13:27.193 --> 13:28.058
Get this.

13:28.561 --> 13:31.953
Kevin thought
I was gonna sell my Bowflex for $200,

13:32.078 --> 13:35.023
and I told him,
"dude, this was a prop in my movie".

13:35.815 --> 13:37.193
I need to talk to you.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.356
It's because
we haven't sold anything.

13:39.481 --> 13:41.014
{\*You know what?}We {\*just }wait till the end of the day.

13:41.139 --> 13:43.282
People get desperate,
{\*and }they're gonna pay anything.

13:43.672 --> 13:45.534
{\*I think }I need to go home to Colorado.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.593
My dad isn't doing so well.

13:51.295 --> 13:52.958
Okay. For how long?

13:53.442 --> 13:54.592
I don't know.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.046
Is he all right?
You okay?

13:57.795 --> 14:00.349
I {\*just }don't want to go home
when he's on his deathbed{\*, you know?}.

14:00.474 --> 14:02.426
I want to be there
when he's still my dad.

14:03.587 --> 14:05.262
You definitely need to do that.

14:05.635 --> 14:07.389
And I want you to come with me.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.310
I know that's a lot to ask
of a boyfriend.

14:14.817 --> 14:16.560
And I was thinking,{\* you know,}

14:16.685 --> 14:20.363
maybe,
since given our last conversation,

14:21.526 --> 14:23.239
and that we're both ready...

14:24.989 --> 14:26.736
Michael Scott, will you...

14:28.043 --> 14:29.662
Shut it.

14:36.447 --> 14:37.461
What?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.876
No, I am not going to be proposed to
in the break room.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.213
That is not going to be our story.

14:45.662 --> 14:48.147
Should have burned this place down
when I had the chance.

14:50.933 --> 14:51.892
{\pub}{\*Guys. }It's my turn.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.311
You can't go, you're dead.
I shot you five moves ago.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.064
I told you you can't shoot people.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.352
I told you we're way past rules.
We have been for some time now.

15:00.477 --> 15:03.404
Start having rules now,
everything we've built collapses.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.169
This is stupid,
and I want my money back.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.701
Where's the money?

15:10.152 --> 15:11.552
Yeah, where is it?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.974
You know what?
I am never ever playing games

15:16.099 --> 15:17.706
with you two again.

15:23.027 --> 15:25.421
And that is Dallas.

15:29.578 --> 15:31.599
- Not bad, right?
- I can't really tell.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.743
- Nice.
- I know, right?

15:35.684 --> 15:36.896
What the...

15:40.539 --> 15:42.412
- That's impossible.
- It is, right?

15:42.779 --> 15:43.986
I mean, {\*it's }impossible.

15:47.449 --> 15:48.866
{\*All right, }I'll take them.

15:49.675 --> 15:51.383
- They're probably worthless.
- Probably.

15:51.675 --> 15:53.202
Leave the telescope.

15:57.161 --> 15:58.626
<i>I started with a thumbtack</i>

15:59.100 --> 16:01.388
and traded my way to a telescope.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.725
But{\* in a way,} the most valuable thing here
wasn't the telescope at all.

16:07.219 --> 16:08.557
It was this...

16:08.682 --> 16:11.136
packet of beans,
so I traded the telescope for it.

16:12.444 --> 16:14.736
And I can just
go buy another telescope.

16:21.032 --> 16:22.858
- How'd we do?
- $13.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.382
{\*That's }Great.
And we still have most of our stuff.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.404
Listen{\*, about earlier}...

16:27.570 --> 16:29.281
No.
Let's not talk about that.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.737
I was wrong to put you
in that position.

16:32.353 --> 16:34.253
Michael, you're my life now.

16:34.482 --> 16:35.746
I{\*'m not going} won't go to Colorado.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.658
You know what?

16:39.421 --> 16:41.752
Let's go for a walk.
I want to show you some stuff.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.718
So this is one
of my favorite places in the world.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.602
- Why?
- This is where Toby announced

16:51.727 --> 16:53.414
that he was going to Costa Rica.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.258
It was the happiest day of my life...

16:56.383 --> 16:58.394
Until the day you came
to replace him.

17:01.304 --> 17:02.654
Let's go in here.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.540
And this is where we first kissed.

17:08.665 --> 17:09.714
I remember.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.369
And this is where we first made love.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.281
- Remember what I tried there?
- Michael!

17:18.531 --> 17:19.949
Through these blinds,

17:20.433 --> 17:22.251
is where I first saw you.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.814
You had all these boxes,

17:23.939 --> 17:26.172
and I thought you were
the prettiest mover I had ever seen.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.342
And I was sitting at this desk...

17:31.338 --> 17:34.214
When I called you
to tell you that I had herpes,

17:34.339 --> 17:35.806
and that I {\*was }still {\*in love with }loved you.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.018
And you said that it was over
and that you didn't love me.

17:40.478 --> 17:43.481
And thank goodness {\*none of }that wasn't true,
including the herpes.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.017
It was an ingrown hair.

17:45.142 --> 17:46.342
Right in here.

17:48.032 --> 17:50.175
This is where we co-ran
our first meeting.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.573
Remember?
Obesity awareness?

17:53.710 --> 17:56.452
Saved a lot of lives that day.
{\*That's where }You first met Michael Klump.

17:56.931 --> 17:58.537
I say, I say I sit on you.

17:59.974 --> 18:02.271
And right {\*over }there,
{\*that's where }you realized that Meredith

18:02.396 --> 18:04.293
was prostituting herself
for outback steak.

18:04.738 --> 18:06.814
And I will never forget
{\*that }you had the cutest look

18:06.939 --> 18:08.969
on your face
because you couldn't believe it.

18:09.094 --> 18:10.994
You thought it was so wrong.

18:11.788 --> 18:14.136
- And over here...
- What happened here?

18:14.302 --> 18:16.833
Well, nothing.
Nothing really.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.658
I would just find
an excuse to come here...

18:19.916 --> 18:21.852
So I could stare at you
through that window.

18:23.138 --> 18:24.647
This is what I'd do.

18:27.234 --> 18:28.234
Nice.

18:29.427 --> 18:31.320
- Let's go in here.
- Here?

18:37.035 --> 18:38.035
Hi, guys.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.285
This is where our love
faces its toughest test.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.136
After this, just smooth sailing
for the rest of our lives.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.653
- Holly, will you marry me?
- No.

18:51.559 --> 18:54.394
- Marry me, holly.
- No.

18:54.722 --> 18:56.916
That guy's got more than
he can handle as it is.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.989
- Will you marry me?
- No.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.776
- That marriage would be a sham.
- Will you marry me?

19:01.901 --> 19:03.492
- No.
- Easy no.

19:03.617 --> 19:05.013
- Will you marry me?
- No.

19:05.138 --> 19:06.649
{\*That would be hot.}I would pay to see that.

19:06.774 --> 19:09.114
- Will you marry me, Holly?
- No.

19:09.239 --> 19:11.527
Only one that I was
kind of worried about.

19:35.031 --> 19:37.052
This is where
I fell in love with you...

19:38.803 --> 19:41.182
And this is where
I ask you to marry me.

19:53.374 --> 19:54.723
It started with...

20:08.911 --> 20:10.061
Holly Flax...

20:11.260 --> 20:13.380
Marrying me will you be?

20:15.054 --> 20:18.177
Your wife becoming...
Be will I.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.322
- That is so awesome.
- Congratulations!

20:38.488 --> 20:39.642
Thank you!

20:39.767 --> 20:41.366
So, guys...

20:42.116 --> 20:43.661
We're moving to Colorado.

20:44.132 --> 20:45.079
All of us?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.123
Wait. What?

20:47.394 --> 20:51.460
Holly has to go back to Colorado.
I'm going with her, I'm leaving.
