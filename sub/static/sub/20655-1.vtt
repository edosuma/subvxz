02:00.560 --> 02:03.121
Hello, doctor. I hope it
isn't an imposition, Judge.

02:03.616 --> 02:06.613
Not at all. I've often wondered what
was at the back of these grim doors.

02:06.914 --> 02:08.414
It's exactly what you would expect.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.913
Excellent taste. Inherited wealth.

02:12.491 --> 02:13.792
The face of our forefathers.

02:14.015 --> 02:15.860
It's not always what meets
the eye, gentlemen.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.820
When you see my aunt Matilda ..

02:17.920 --> 02:20.770
You will understand why I sometimes
think I live in a booby-hatch.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.261
Well, that's too bad.

02:22.615 --> 02:26.360
I used to walk by here with father on my
way to the cathedral when I was a kid.

02:27.376 --> 02:30.363
I remember how the carriage
with green lamps stood outside.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.290
A span of chestnuts in park harness.

02:33.539 --> 02:36.134
Footman holding the bridle.
A lackey at the carriage door.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.783
A coachman up on the box.

02:39.108 --> 02:42.692
Waiting to take the old Wall Street
pirate and his two daughters to church.

02:43.606 --> 02:46.307
Now you can see why I would give
anything to avoid a court action.

02:46.914 --> 02:49.668
She is such a lovely old heirloom
despite her eccentricities.

02:50.491 --> 02:51.595
[ Gong sound ]

02:59.609 --> 03:03.017
I always ring that gong gentlemen to
warn people to stop talking about me.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.128
Behind me back.

03:06.525 --> 03:08.344
Aunt Matilda, this is Judge Alston.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.768
And Dr Doremus.

03:14.833 --> 03:15.962
I expected the judge.

03:17.048 --> 03:19.113
But why the doctor?
Do you wish to take my pulse?

03:19.721 --> 03:21.561
No, Miss Reed. I'm a psychiatrist.

03:23.483 --> 03:24.612
You live by your wits.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.426
And that isn't an insult.

03:27.410 --> 03:29.243
I love men who live by their wits.

03:30.541 --> 03:31.444
Tea is served.

03:32.944 --> 03:33.824
Oh no. No.

03:34.326 --> 03:35.227
Just a minute.

03:36.504 --> 03:37.376
My bluebirds.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.131
Williams. Robert.

04:05.465 --> 04:06.696
Now .. ready?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.494
And now gentlemen,
shall we have our tea?

04:32.781 --> 04:34.025
Doctor, over there please.

04:37.436 --> 04:38.890
Judge Alston. Phillip.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.709
I understand Judge Alston ..

04:50.809 --> 04:53.713
That Phillip wishes to spare me
the ordeal of a court hearing.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.602
This is purely an informal
visit, Miss Reed.

04:56.912 --> 04:58.511
Nothing official, I assure you.

04:59.022 --> 05:00.724
Well, I won't let you
drag me into court.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.004
I have no intention of
ordering you into court.

05:06.456 --> 05:08.616
You think Judge Alston is
afraid if I go to this court ..

05:08.982 --> 05:10.972
I'll find out how crazy
everybody else is?

05:12.459 --> 05:14.309
The Judge makes sense sometimes.

05:15.237 --> 05:15.966
Alright.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.168
I'll make sense.

05:17.907 --> 05:18.836
Lemon or cream?

05:19.056 --> 05:19.986
Lemon, please.

05:25.975 --> 05:26.933
Make mine cream.

05:37.151 --> 05:39.505
Do you mind if I just have
a drink, aunt Matilda?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.546
We have no license to transport whiskey.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.045
You see, this railroad
system was founded ..

05:46.761 --> 05:47.985
When my boys were little.

05:49.067 --> 05:49.966
Your boys?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.776
Didn't Phillip tell you
I have three sons?

05:53.422 --> 05:55.954
No. He told me you once
adopted three wards.

05:58.402 --> 05:59.015
No.

05:59.798 --> 06:00.727
They were sons.

06:02.641 --> 06:03.485
Michael.

06:03.865 --> 06:04.586
Mario.

06:05.412 --> 06:06.284
And Jonathan.

06:10.352 --> 06:12.635
I suppose you are wondering
about these little trains.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.905
They belong to my sons.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.158
In the old days, up in the
playroom when teatime came ..

06:18.492 --> 06:21.697
We always played railroads,
to bring their food to them.

06:23.771 --> 06:24.654
But lately ..

06:25.127 --> 06:28.897
It's been too much effort for me to play
with them down on my hands and knees.

06:29.174 --> 06:30.023
So I ..

06:31.668 --> 06:33.021
It is fun pretending ..

06:33.742 --> 06:35.780
My boys are here with
me at the big table.

06:37.257 --> 06:38.530
Would you say that's crazy?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.235
No-one minds if you
play trains, aunt Matilda.

06:41.695 --> 06:43.025
But it is these other things.

06:43.264 --> 06:47.432
A little item of $1,675,000
in the past nine months.

06:48.236 --> 06:50.471
She bought half a million
dollars' worth of dead rats.

06:53.364 --> 06:56.339
I gave a great many poor
children a dollar apiece.

06:56.656 --> 06:58.106
For catching those rats.

06:59.239 --> 07:00.565
And they gave me this medal.

07:02.348 --> 07:03.992
It's worth half a million dollars to me.

07:06.629 --> 07:09.565
And that camp for the unhappily married,
three quarters of a million dollars.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.892
And she only prevented one divorce.

07:12.163 --> 07:13.582
A blacksmith and his wife.

07:16.952 --> 07:18.268
I got this ring for that.

07:18.957 --> 07:21.211
Of course, it is only made
out of a horseshoe nail.

07:22.097 --> 07:24.342
But it was made by a
very happy blacksmith.

07:25.930 --> 07:26.845
It is worth.

07:27.169 --> 07:29.133
750 thousand dollars.

07:30.661 --> 07:31.333
To me.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.362
If you want to know where
the rest of the money went ..

07:35.881 --> 07:38.041
There is a diploma out
there in the front hall.

07:38.554 --> 07:41.471
And when I think how hard I worked
to build up those income properties.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.246
That Rayon plant in Canada.

07:43.801 --> 07:46.288
And the rubber plantation
up the Amazon. Yes.

07:47.586 --> 07:49.429
Phillip has managed very well.

07:50.725 --> 07:53.617
Then why Miss Matilda can't
you settle all this amicably ..

07:53.717 --> 07:55.854
Without a lot of dull court procedure?

07:56.350 --> 07:59.617
It will be so simple to make Phillip
the administrator of the entire estate.

08:00.315 --> 08:01.069
Oh, no.

08:01.494 --> 08:02.080
No.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.519
Phillip has done well,
but the bulk of my estate?

08:05.692 --> 08:06.751
Oh no. No.

08:07.847 --> 08:09.122
Then who would you trust?

08:11.046 --> 08:12.753
Any one of my three sons.

08:13.617 --> 08:16.020
I'd like very much to meet them.
- Indeed, you must.

08:17.041 --> 08:17.970
Where are they?

08:18.493 --> 08:19.079
Oh.

08:19.490 --> 08:20.892
I haven't the faintest idea.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.394
You probably wouldn't
even recognise them now.

08:23.664 --> 08:25.394
That is what is so
pathetic, Judge Alston.

08:25.901 --> 08:27.343
Aunt Matilda adopted three boys.

08:27.531 --> 08:30.120
Gave them every advantage that she
gave me and then when they grew up ..

08:30.632 --> 08:31.790
They walked out on her.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.618
And you haven't heard from them since?

08:35.038 --> 08:36.741
They refused to sponge on me.

08:40.851 --> 08:43.482
They decided to go out in the
world and make their own way.

08:44.530 --> 08:45.946
Didn't you try and stop them?

08:46.771 --> 08:47.883
I loved them for it.

08:49.812 --> 08:52.156
We'll be alright, they said.
So don't try to find us.

08:53.827 --> 08:55.167
But if you ever need us.

08:55.947 --> 08:56.876
We'll be there.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.404
That's the kind of men my sons are.

09:02.272 --> 09:03.691
And I respected their wishes.

09:05.458 --> 09:09.183
Now, if you are suggesting that I turn
my affairs over to one of my boys ..

09:09.949 --> 09:13.220
You would trust a fortune of millions
to boys you once befriended?

09:13.631 --> 09:15.615
From whom you haven't heard in years?

09:16.282 --> 09:18.188
Yes. And you would too,
if you could meet them.

09:19.921 --> 09:21.177
But how can I meet them?

09:27.254 --> 09:30.138
Drop in for a cup of
punch on Christmas Eve.

09:32.308 --> 09:33.380
I'll have them here.

09:34.493 --> 09:35.508
Right by the tree.

09:37.379 --> 09:39.100
Then you can judge for yourself.

09:40.023 --> 09:41.300
On Christmas Eve?

09:42.373 --> 09:44.570
That's the time when
families are together.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.385
And now gentlemen,
if you will excuse em.

09:53.648 --> 09:54.953
All this talk of money.

09:56.877 --> 09:58.064
Makes me a little tired.

10:01.486 --> 10:04.419
It was awfully nice of you
Miss Matilda to let us drop in.

10:04.926 --> 10:06.146
Don't forget to be here.

10:07.494 --> 10:08.707
Good evening, Miss Reed.

10:25.623 --> 10:28.351
From the United and Benevolent
Order of Scrub Women.

10:28.709 --> 10:30.818
Four hundred and forty thousand dollars.

10:31.916 --> 10:34.382
I've seen enough.
- She's a very interesting old lady.

10:34.894 --> 10:36.860
Admittedly Judge,
I'm no financial wizard.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.385
But proposing to bring
back one of those three ..

10:39.588 --> 10:41.322
Yeah. On Christmas Eve.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.230
I wouldn't even recognise them. Ha!

10:50.813 --> 10:53.733
That fast train, madam.
That would be Mr Michael's wouldn't it?

10:54.103 --> 10:54.739
Yes.

10:55.342 --> 10:58.516
If Michael knew what they were trying
to do .. he'd come speeding back to me.

10:59.183 --> 10:59.826
Fast.

11:01.601 --> 11:04.175
Michael always did like
the fast things in life.

11:27.330 --> 11:28.059
Come in.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.305
Put it over there.

11:34.497 --> 11:35.235
No, no.

11:36.459 --> 11:37.932
Put it over here by the love seat.

11:47.119 --> 11:48.969
First, you must come
over here to get it.

11:49.069 --> 11:50.048
Thank you, sir.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.245
[ Door knocks ]

11:57.845 --> 11:59.032
It's me.
- Oh.

11:59.325 --> 12:00.675
Come in and get it over with.

12:06.189 --> 12:08.151
It must be a lot easier
with snow on the ground.

12:09.587 --> 12:10.283
Well.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.171
You're going to make
that maid lose her job.

12:13.271 --> 12:14.715
Well, I told her I was your wife.

12:16.365 --> 12:18.333
You are expecting somebody?
- Natch.

12:19.066 --> 12:19.881
Who is she?

12:21.267 --> 12:22.025
Now look.

12:22.806 --> 12:25.003
If you want a glass of wine
go on down to the bar ..

12:25.391 --> 12:26.901
Order a quart and sign my name.

12:27.606 --> 12:29.308
I think you'd better
order another glass.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.306
And another quart.

12:34.745 --> 12:35.760
Let's drink to us.

12:37.670 --> 12:38.988
You are getting out of here.

12:39.088 --> 12:40.271
For good.
- Not me.

12:40.496 --> 12:42.688
Now, I told you yesterday
we were through. Finished.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.807
Uhuh. I love you.
- Gee, I know.

12:44.987 --> 12:45.859
You told me.

12:56.304 --> 12:59.075
What's the matter, dreamboat? Didn't
you have your vitamins this morning?

13:06.547 --> 13:08.077
What has she got that I haven't got?

13:08.409 --> 13:09.624
I'll do anything for you.

13:10.535 --> 13:12.040
I'll learn to use those snow shoes.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.953
I'd jump off the highest mountain.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.295
I don't want you to jump.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.912
Just ride downstairs in
the elevator by yourself.

13:18.165 --> 13:18.951
But quick.

13:33.174 --> 13:34.435
You'll break your arm.

13:34.535 --> 13:37.221
Are you going to put those things back
or shall I throw you out the window?

13:38.648 --> 13:39.812
[ Door knocks ]

13:40.315 --> 13:41.416
Get in there.

13:43.169 --> 13:44.184
I'll get it, dear.

13:47.558 --> 13:49.889
A package for Mr Michael Brooks
from the jeweller in the lobby.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.165
"<i>Darling, this is how much I love you</i>."

13:53.668 --> 13:55.370
"<i>Think about me while
I'm on the way up</i>."

13:55.688 --> 13:57.189
Don't stand there. Slip him a buck.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.648
What do you suppose was in it?

14:13.298 --> 14:14.005
Here.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.389
But Michael, the room.

14:24.843 --> 14:26.433
I thought you would be packed by now.

14:26.788 --> 14:29.658
Well, she just came by to help me pack.

Oh how nice. I'm Harriet.
I'm Michael's fiancée.

Fiancée?

14:37.990 --> 14:38.854
Of course.

14:39.892 --> 14:42.231
Didn't you tell her we were going
to be married this afternoon?

14:42.331 --> 14:45.478
Yes, that's why I asked her round. To
her that we were going to get married.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.796
Well, we haven't much time, Michael.

14:48.072 --> 14:50.207
We wouldn't want to keep
the minister waiting, would we.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.565
No. I'll say we wouldn't.

14:51.830 --> 14:52.887
Go ahead and pack.

14:53.358 --> 14:55.489
You pack him this time and
I'll take him from hereon in.

Don't forget his long flannels.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.735
Why don't you thank her
for her lovely present?

14:59.962 --> 15:02.077
Oh darling, it was just what I wanted.

15:02.495 --> 15:04.377
That little gold locket
with my picture in it?

15:04.477 --> 15:05.345
I loved it.

15:12.269 --> 15:14.057
Look, you don't have
to hide your relatives.

15:14.657 --> 15:17.368
I've got a few myself that we
don't let out until after dark.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.475
Don't mind me. I'm the orphan
that aunt Matilda <i>didn't</i> adopt.

But you are wonderful.

Sapphires are my weakness.

15:38.835 --> 15:41.263
And this beautiful sable coat.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.985
Just a few little wedding presents.

15:46.064 --> 15:47.966
I am awfully sorry that
she had to drop in here.

and go on our honeymoon with us.

True. How true.

me just one moment?

16:05.956 --> 16:06.634
Yes.

16:12.519 --> 16:14.392
What's the idea of bringing
my clothes in here?

16:26.588 --> 16:27.677
[ Door knocks ]

16:35.000 --> 16:36.988
Aren't you the lady that
sent me up here with this?

16:37.465 --> 16:39.971
It came sailing out the window and
hit the doorman right on the head.

16:40.896 --> 16:41.682
Thank you.

16:55.044 --> 16:56.059
Now, is that nice?

16:56.330 --> 16:58.327
I'm supposed to be in here
talking to my sister ..

16:58.427 --> 17:01.033
And I have to go back in there
with cherry pie all over my face.

17:02.026 --> 17:03.527
I'm not going to let you marry her.

17:03.994 --> 17:05.238
What's the matter with me?

17:05.631 --> 17:06.795
Haven't we had fun?

17:07.288 --> 17:08.339
Don't you love me?

17:08.439 --> 17:10.210
Look sweetheart. Of course I love you.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.971
But my marriage to Harriet?
That is destiny.

17:13.519 --> 17:14.637
Two wealthy families.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.648
So. Here I go.
- You're not going anywhere.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.288
I'm going out there to talk with ..
- Ann! Come here.

17:21.483 --> 17:22.337
Come here!

17:24.247 --> 17:26.320
Did you arrange things
with your little sister?

17:26.508 --> 17:27.662
Everything is all set.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.811
What say we have a loving
cup with Ann before we go?

17:29.911 --> 17:30.635
Not I.

17:31.030 --> 17:33.274
I wouldn't be your sister if I
didn't tell this lady that ..

17:33.470 --> 17:34.817
She is making a big mistake.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.766
You are not the marrying type.

17:37.052 --> 17:38.432
I wouldn't say that, Ann.

17:39.335 --> 17:42.020
It's been my experience with husbands
that he's the perfect marrying type.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.820
It may interest you to know ..
- It may.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.369
Ladies, please.
- Alright.

17:46.075 --> 17:48.684
It may interest <i>me</i> to know
that Ann is not your sister.

17:48.911 --> 17:50.527
Look Harriet, I can explain everything.

17:51.201 --> 17:52.960
I'm terribly sorry about
all this, Michael.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.631
The moment I laid eyes on
you I said: "that's the guy".

17:56.735 --> 17:58.986
But I am selfish enough
to want you just for me.

18:00.138 --> 18:01.897
Thank you for all these
beautiful presents.

18:03.810 --> 18:06.056
Take good care of your "little sister".

18:11.141 --> 18:12.346
I knew she was yellow.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.801
I'm going to break
every bone in your body.

18:20.901 --> 18:23.304
Michael, if you were just a few
jumps ahead of the Sheriff ..

18:23.404 --> 18:25.790
I wouldn't have let that moneybags
get out of here. Honest.

18:26.090 --> 18:27.391
I would have taken a powder.

18:27.952 --> 18:29.550
If that is another rich widow, I'll ..

18:30.635 --> 18:31.307
Hello?

18:31.423 --> 18:33.356
"<i>Phillip Hastings is
calling on Mr Brooks</i>."

18:33.946 --> 18:34.818
Give it here.

18:35.729 --> 18:37.100
Tell him I can't be disturbed.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.586
"<i>He's already on his way up</i>."

18:38.686 --> 18:41.465
Well, stop the elevator.
Pull him out. I won't see him.

18:42.381 --> 18:43.853
Send up the dinner menu please.

18:45.096 --> 18:46.111
Aren't you hungry?

18:47.296 --> 18:48.969
Maybe I had better ..
- Oh no you don't.

18:49.132 --> 18:51.986
You're so good at getting rid of people.
Just try your hand on this bird.

18:59.704 --> 19:01.892
Where you been all these years, Michael?
- I've been fine.

19:03.249 --> 19:05.052
I didn't ask you <i>how</i> you'd been.

19:05.487 --> 19:06.903
And I didn't say <i>where</i> I'd been.

19:07.674 --> 19:09.216
I wouldn't have known you were here.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.399
But I ran into Dickinson at
the club the other night.

19:11.575 --> 19:13.519
He's President of the Madison
Bank now, you know.

19:13.619 --> 19:14.678
Well then, Phillip.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.567
We must get together one of these days
and hear about the boys but right now ..

19:18.293 --> 19:19.737
Aren't you going to introduce me?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.011
Oh.

19:21.649 --> 19:23.374
This is Mr Phillip Hastings.

19:23.614 --> 19:24.585
Miss Ann Nelson.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.429
Phillip is aunt Matilda's nephew.

19:27.046 --> 19:28.948
That sort-of makes you
first cousin, doesn't it?

19:29.156 --> 19:31.366
Well, isn't this cosy.
Won't you stay for dinner?

19:31.613 --> 19:33.566
The menu is coming right up.
- Now, Ann.

19:33.956 --> 19:35.801
Phillip is one of the
busiest men in New York.

19:35.901 --> 19:38.485
He manages aunt Matilda's estate.
- Only part of it.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.998
No, I really can't stay for
dinner Miss Nelson, but I ..

19:41.427 --> 19:44.880
I never pass up the chance of a
glass of wine with a pretty girl.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.678
Still the best of
everything, eh Michael?

19:53.393 --> 19:54.952
Michael does have the best, you know.

19:55.399 --> 19:57.221
Phillip, an occasional bottle of wine.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.665
If it were only an
<i>occasional </i> bottle of wine.

19:59.961 --> 20:01.313
That's why I'm here, Michael.

20:01.413 --> 20:04.758
Just a chance remark that Dickinson made
at the club about your bank account.

20:06.369 --> 20:08.705
Perhaps I had best go.
- No. Please stay where you are.

20:09.993 --> 20:12.236
You see, Michael.
Aunt Matilda is getting along.

20:12.591 --> 20:14.466
We just cannot put her
through another shock.

20:15.054 --> 20:17.610
If that sainted old lady knew that
Michael was back here in town ..

20:17.942 --> 20:20.888
And had cashed $75,000 in bad checks.

20:21.433 --> 20:22.953
Michael has been bouncing rubber?

20:24.630 --> 20:26.357
Phillip, I did have a deal.

20:26.883 --> 20:29.400
I was about to wrap it
up this afternoon but ..

20:29.641 --> 20:30.691
Something happened.

20:31.414 --> 20:32.572
I know, Michael I know.

20:32.923 --> 20:35.287
You always have a rainbow.
Just around the corner.

20:36.107 --> 20:37.837
He just can't go on
doing things this way.

20:38.284 --> 20:40.525
He can't pay $32,000 for a sable coat.

20:40.905 --> 20:42.669
He can't buy sapphire wristwatches.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.495
Those things get around.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.542
Yes .. usually they get
around the wrong people.

20:49.028 --> 20:51.724
Now, Phillip. You know that you
have to send money after money.

20:51.824 --> 20:53.783
And at the time they seemed
like good investments.

20:54.304 --> 20:55.896
Can I help it if a pal ratted on me ..

20:55.996 --> 20:58.381
At the psychological moment that
I was about to close the deal?

21:00.792 --> 21:02.061
Mr Hastings.

21:02.774 --> 21:05.045
If I had known about
this terrible expense.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.380
Of course, my dear.
I am not criticising you.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.542
But I know you can get
an elegant cloth coat ..

21:10.801 --> 21:13.497
Smart .. for around $135.

21:14.143 --> 21:16.614
And a wristwatch to charm
any girl for around for $49.50

21:19.685 --> 21:20.699
Alright. Alright.

21:20.954 --> 21:23.917
I've got $75,000 worth of
rubber smoking up the town.

21:24.443 --> 21:25.887
What are we going to do about it?

21:27.732 --> 21:29.334
I hope you won't go to aunt Matilda.

21:29.650 --> 21:30.236
No.

21:31.429 --> 21:33.280
About that deal I had this afternoon.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.428
I still think there is a chance ..

21:35.650 --> 21:37.182
Not a chance, Michael. Not a chance.

21:37.482 --> 21:39.285
Who asked your opinion?
- Please, please.

21:40.121 --> 21:42.992
I didn't come out here to start a
squabble between a pair of lovebirds.

21:43.689 --> 21:45.372
You know, I almost envy Michael.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.881
Sapphires, sable, vintage champagne.

21:48.826 --> 21:50.813
I sometimes wish I had
spent a little more money.

21:53.685 --> 21:55.600
I got those checks from Dickinson.

21:56.058 --> 21:57.617
$75,000 out of my own pocket.

21:58.213 --> 21:59.085
Phillip, you?

21:59.512 --> 22:01.657
You picked up those checks
out of your own pocket?

22:02.178 --> 22:04.623
I would rather take the loss
myself than involve aunt Matilda.

22:05.119 --> 22:06.420
She is an old lady, Michael.

22:06.604 --> 22:08.682
It would kill her to read that
you'd been put in jail.

22:08.879 --> 22:11.810
Phillip, I'll walk into your office
next week and buy those checks back.

22:12.072 --> 22:13.230
I hope you do, Michael.

22:13.445 --> 22:14.746
I'll just hold them for you.

22:15.574 --> 22:16.657
I enjoyed the wine.

22:22.262 --> 22:24.121
$75,000 without a whimper.

22:29.022 --> 22:31.185
Hasn't it all turned out wonderful?
- Oh, you are crazy.

22:31.285 --> 22:32.162
Oh, Michael.

22:32.387 --> 22:35.179
I thought I'd lose you as you're a rich
man, and now you haven't got a quarter.

22:35.279 --> 22:36.396
Isn't it wonderful!

22:47.488 --> 22:49.848
Thank you all for being
kind enough to come here.

22:50.653 --> 22:52.837
And humor the vagaries of an old woman.

22:54.578 --> 22:57.270
I am sure that through
this worldwide publicity.

22:57.908 --> 23:00.340
We shall find .. my three sons.

23:02.039 --> 23:06.047
And I hope the ghost of my sainted
father will forgive me for ..

23:06.666 --> 23:08.812
Having newspaper people in his house.

23:10.948 --> 23:14.760
Would you say Mr Hastings, your nephew
was back at the surrogate's visit?

23:16.060 --> 23:18.537
Oh, the surrogate made
it quite clear that ..

23:19.280 --> 23:21.368
His call was merely as a family friend.

23:22.184 --> 23:24.956
In other words, Phillip Hastings
tried to put the pressure on you.

23:29.397 --> 23:30.596
Refreshments, madam.

23:31.012 --> 23:32.439
In the dining room.

23:39.736 --> 23:41.858
Tell me more about this nephew, Phillip.

23:42.473 --> 23:44.837
And what was the
surrogate's real attitude?

23:46.276 --> 23:47.576
He thinks I'm crazy.

24:17.183 --> 24:18.600
Morning, Mr Brooks.
- Morning.

24:26.812 --> 24:29.492
Imagine that?
They say the old lady is crazy.

24:30.042 --> 24:31.625
The whole world is crazy.

24:32.469 --> 24:33.178
Natch.

24:40.094 --> 24:41.716
Read all about in the papers, mister.

24:45.997 --> 24:48.966
Well .. did you know they were
trying to put the old lady away?

24:50.475 --> 24:52.837
Imagine living in a gloomy
mansion like that. I'd go nuts.

24:54.419 --> 24:55.910
Seeing that guy Phillip every day.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.946
He is probably the one
that is driving her crazy.

25:00.251 --> 25:01.301
You know, Michael.

25:01.631 --> 25:04.309
Too bad the old lady can't have
a fling now and again with you.

25:05.162 --> 25:06.263
It would do her good.

25:06.795 --> 25:08.125
Waltzing around dance floors.

25:08.389 --> 25:10.774
"<i>Phillip paid off those checks
out of his own pocket</i>."

25:11.923 --> 25:15.272
"<i>He said he did it because he wanted
to spare aunt Matilda the shock</i>."

25:15.785 --> 25:16.910
"<i>At this time</i>."

25:17.467 --> 25:20.328
How you can sit there not caring if
they lock her up in a padded cell.

25:21.054 --> 25:22.154
Just my luck.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.203
Carrying a torch for a
man who's mean enough ..

25:24.303 --> 25:26.758
To see an old lady go to the
booby-hatch without raising a finger.

25:27.311 --> 25:30.767
Phillip is managing her estate.
That guy who was so sweet.

25:31.217 --> 25:33.354
"<i>So Phillip shells out 75 G's</i> .."

25:33.664 --> 25:36.903
"<i>Because he knows they will try and
put aunt Matilda in the booby-hatch</i>."

25:38.419 --> 25:40.793
"<i>Who is trying to put aunt
Matilda in the booby hatch?</i>"

25:41.438 --> 25:42.310
"<i>I'm asking</i>."

25:42.443 --> 25:44.717
Don't sit there. Rob a bank.
I'll help you.

25:45.429 --> 25:47.793
Get those checks back from
that heel of a nephew.

25:48.356 --> 25:51.530
Don't let them think that lady was crazy
enough to raise a big grafter like you.

25:51.630 --> 25:52.779
Phillip is a snake.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.784
A baby-faced chiseller who
buys cheap wristwatches.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.706
Suppose you do go to jail
for a little while. Imagine.

26:00.073 --> 26:02.843
"<i>Phillip paid all that dough
to get a stranglehold on me</i>."

26:03.519 --> 26:05.532
"<i>If I could only get those checks back</i>."

26:06.505 --> 26:07.914
"<i>A smart boy, that Phillip</i>."

26:08.014 --> 26:09.973
I don't care if we live
under the Brooklyn bridge.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.814
I don't expect people to be on
the level about little things ..

26:13.040 --> 26:13.943
But this ..

26:14.533 --> 26:16.592
Well, don't sit there like that.
Do something!

26:20.949 --> 26:22.894
Come on. We are going
to call on cousin Phillip.

26:23.516 --> 26:25.056
Waiter .. waiter!

26:26.934 --> 26:28.460
Hello, Mr Brooks.
- Good morning.

26:29.156 --> 26:29.844
Sit.

26:35.757 --> 26:38.432
You just sit here baby, and learn
all about the Navaho Indians.

26:38.949 --> 26:41.051
They'll be lucky to get out of
here with their wigwams.

26:48.562 --> 26:49.291
Phillip.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.506
After reading the morning papers I've
figured your angle on those bum checks.

26:53.774 --> 26:55.086
Well, the papers are wrong.

26:55.186 --> 26:58.212
I don't want any more responsibility
about Matilda's estate than I've got.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.203
But Phillip.

26:59.303 --> 27:02.807
Don't come here accusing me of trying to
take over more of Matilda's fortune ..

27:02.907 --> 27:04.779
Than she has already
heaped upon my shoulders.

27:05.371 --> 27:08.800
It turned my hair gray making this
Rayon factory in Canada pay off.

27:11.702 --> 27:13.232
And that rubber plant up the Amazon.

27:13.805 --> 27:14.877
I got malaria there.

27:17.603 --> 27:21.001
I picked up your checks only to
save aunt Matilda further shock.

27:21.922 --> 27:25.830
Then I guess you were right in dropping
me that $75,000 hint to get out of town.

27:27.121 --> 27:30.160
I don't suppose I would make much of
a showing at aunt Matilda's hearings.

27:30.623 --> 27:32.582
Especially if the surrogate
got his hooks into me.

27:32.970 --> 27:35.101
Now you are getting at the
heart of the thing, Michael.

27:37.938 --> 27:39.079
I dare say the ..

27:39.624 --> 27:40.811
The further away I am ..

27:41.652 --> 27:43.370
The better it will be for aunt Matilda.

27:46.704 --> 27:48.989
But I do want to work
out that debt I owe you.

27:51.502 --> 27:52.088
Oh?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.366
What shall it be?

27:55.000 --> 27:55.843
Canada or ..

27:56.784 --> 27:57.676
The Amazon?

27:58.230 --> 28:00.332
For heaven's sakes stay away
from hose dreadful places.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.925
But Phillip, I haven't got a button.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.082
Well, make the girl hock the sable
coat and the sapphire watch.

28:06.563 --> 28:08.250
Oh, the girl that got those ..

28:09.014 --> 28:10.630
She is just water over the dam.

28:41.672 --> 28:43.032
What did you do with the body?

28:43.672 --> 28:44.721
Will you marry me?

28:46.151 --> 28:47.808
Would you go in there and tap him again?

28:48.023 --> 28:50.861
And after we're married, ten thousand
dollars' worth of Palm Springs.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.136
I thought you would
punch him on the nose.

28:53.236 --> 28:56.059
Horseback riding in the moonlight.
Winter fruit. Desert sun.

28:56.561 --> 28:57.672
Bingo in the lounge.

28:58.693 --> 28:59.336
Well.

29:00.618 --> 29:02.005
You finally taught me a lesson.

29:02.510 --> 29:03.979
Always glad to help a girl out.

29:05.543 --> 29:06.930
Been nice knowing you, Michael.

29:14.964 --> 29:18.114
I've had a thousand calls since you
brought in the newspaper people.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.639
I make a friendly visit ..

29:20.739 --> 29:24.297
And suddenly find myself accused of
trying to railroad you into an asylum.

29:25.255 --> 29:26.972
But I had to take a long chance.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.662
How else can my sons
know that I am in trouble?

29:30.372 --> 29:34.435
You wouldn't be in trouble if you
would only stop these eccentricities.

29:35.114 --> 29:36.290
You don't understand.

29:36.710 --> 29:39.887
Dear Miss Reed. It is <i>you</i>
who don't understand.

29:40.729 --> 29:41.959
If you make it appear ..

29:42.059 --> 29:45.847
That I'm trying to deprive you of your
freedom in some sort of unethical way ..

29:46.232 --> 29:48.594
I told you Judge,
that you can't stop her.

29:49.607 --> 29:52.548
You see? Now the judge has
got to take this into court.

29:52.848 --> 29:54.516
Don't put words into my mouth, Phillip.

29:55.749 --> 29:57.770
If you persist in this hue and cry.

29:58.022 --> 30:01.284
You will force me to do what I
came here off the record to avoid.

30:01.487 --> 30:03.379
Then I assure you that I won't do it.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.137
And I am very sorry if I have
caused you any embarrassment.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.545
But don't forget.

30:08.847 --> 30:11.064
That you promised to
drop by on Christmas Eve.

30:11.466 --> 30:12.567
Yes, yes. I promised.

30:12.865 --> 30:14.546
Providing you do nothing further ..

30:14.646 --> 30:15.993
No, no. Of course not.

30:16.349 --> 30:17.536
So don't worry about me.

30:17.756 --> 30:20.028
I will have my sons
here on Christmas Eve.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.804
I heard it all, dear lady.

30:50.904 --> 30:53.442
That's my trade. A private peeper
with an ear through every keyhole.

30:54.681 --> 30:55.826
Yes. Well ..

30:56.714 --> 30:58.616
Pour yourself a drink and
then make your report.

30:58.883 --> 30:59.665
Thanks.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.920
I've got some news for you, dear lady.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.097
Good, say it.

31:05.317 --> 31:06.475
I located your playboy.

31:06.932 --> 31:07.890
Michael is here?

31:08.171 --> 31:09.324
He is in New York.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.159
Then he'll be here Christmas Eve.
I know it.

31:13.688 --> 31:14.875
Not a chance, dear lady.

31:15.171 --> 31:17.747
Some checks bounced right back in
his face and he had to blow town.

31:18.339 --> 31:19.585
Checks? Bounced?

31:19.982 --> 31:21.289
Yeah. Bad checks.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.285
Just when he had a deal all set
to marry a lady by the name of ..

31:24.968 --> 31:25.954
By the name of ..

31:26.752 --> 31:27.690
Harriet Rhodes.

31:28.189 --> 31:29.560
Harriet Rhodes?

31:31.024 --> 31:34.508
All the money in the world wouldn't
make Michael marry that .. moneybags.

31:35.970 --> 31:38.572
Well, he could have done with some
of her money before he disappeared.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.673
Michael was never a bad boy.

31:43.185 --> 31:44.400
He should have come here.

31:45.845 --> 31:47.628
What about the others? What about Mario?

31:48.118 --> 31:49.762
I'm getting through to some pals of his.

31:50.039 --> 31:52.602
And they know where he is?
- Maybe they know. But they dummy up.

31:53.090 --> 31:53.719
Huh?

31:55.541 --> 31:56.728
They ain't talking, see.

31:57.381 --> 31:58.510
But I'm working on it.

32:07.814 --> 32:09.207
Maybe he is so far away ..

32:10.068 --> 32:11.283
He hasn't heard about me.

32:42.169 --> 32:42.898
Darling.

32:44.707 --> 32:45.665
It's about time.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.178
I'll never go away again.

32:56.122 --> 32:57.186
Señor Mario.

32:58.754 --> 33:00.653
[ Spanish language ]

33:06.307 --> 33:07.881
It wasn't any fun without you there.

33:08.814 --> 33:10.287
I thought you loved the mountains.

33:10.551 --> 33:11.680
I thought so too.

33:12.353 --> 33:14.061
But in the mountains I loved only you.

33:19.318 --> 33:21.801
Oh, we are not dining at
your club tonight, darling.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.453
I thought it would be
nicer at my little house.

33:24.846 --> 33:25.788
The two of us.

33:26.449 --> 33:27.950
I've got to stop by my place first.

33:28.946 --> 33:30.027
Then I go with you.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.009
You see, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight.

33:55.755 --> 33:57.050
Can I talk to you a minute?

33:57.708 --> 33:58.389
Sure.

34:00.168 --> 34:00.954
Excuse me.

34:04.299 --> 34:05.804
There's an FBI guy in your office.

34:05.904 --> 34:08.373
I figured you didn't want anyone
like that waiting around outside.

34:09.184 --> 34:10.428
Tell him I'll be right in.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.391
Give me two minutes, please.

34:15.188 --> 34:17.186
Alright. But not one second more.

34:19.273 --> 34:20.204
Sit down.

34:21.742 --> 34:22.414
Hurry.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.713
Sorry he didn't offer you a drink.

34:30.944 --> 34:31.873
Thanks. He did.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.938
But I never drink when I'm working.

34:34.710 --> 34:35.839
Thanks for warning me.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.532
I'd be glad to give you a record
of anything I say to an FBI man.

34:49.757 --> 34:51.417
Look, fellah. You are not my pigeon.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.380
I didn't fly down here to nail you.

34:55.646 --> 34:57.176
You wouldn't like to be in New York?

34:57.513 --> 34:58.757
Walk in to the Stork Club?

34:59.012 --> 34:59.959
See everybody?

35:00.702 --> 35:01.929
I've just seen everybody.

35:02.552 --> 35:03.996
She came in on the evening train.

35:04.749 --> 35:06.165
So if you will make it snappy ..

35:06.930 --> 35:09.004
I suppose you can guess the
business I'm on down here.

35:09.521 --> 35:11.324
In my business we don't
play guessing games.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.625
Especially in front of the FBI.

35:14.629 --> 35:15.735
And besides, I ..

35:16.672 --> 35:17.642
Go on. Go on.

35:18.005 --> 35:19.049
Say the rest of it.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.975
I've no authority down
here to make you guess.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.739
It saves me the trouble
of asking you that.

35:26.214 --> 35:28.354
It still is a pretty good
deal living in the States.

35:29.887 --> 35:31.801
Uncle Sam might appreciate your help.

35:32.238 --> 35:33.028
What help?

35:33.995 --> 35:34.638
Well.

35:35.512 --> 35:37.878
We need a little assistance ..
- I'm no stooge for the cops.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.252
Here or anywhere else.

35:47.554 --> 35:48.741
This is a swell country.

35:49.641 --> 35:52.059
I'll be glad to introduce you
to the Minister of Police.

36:04.094 --> 36:05.590
I forgot to ask you one question.

36:06.302 --> 36:07.861
Did you ever hear of Gustav Reichman?

36:18.617 --> 36:19.661
That's his picture.

36:20.044 --> 36:21.478
I never saw the guy before.

36:24.702 --> 36:27.169
Back in Nuremberg there is a
piece of rope waiting for that lug.

36:29.110 --> 36:31.127
He salted away plenty
down here before the war.

36:31.663 --> 36:33.277
But we're not interested in his dough.

36:34.284 --> 36:37.579
We just want to loop those 13 knots
around this tricky devil's neck.

36:37.911 --> 36:39.327
And let him jump off into space.

36:41.516 --> 36:42.617
Everybody wanted him.

36:43.532 --> 36:45.405
But he slipped through
the back door of Europe.

36:46.716 --> 36:48.360
It could be he's headed for these parts.

36:52.503 --> 36:54.128
I wonder whom he will try to contact.

36:58.623 --> 37:00.029
Would you like to make a guess?

37:01.657 --> 37:03.331
There you go with your guesses again.

37:07.093 --> 37:09.932
It seems to me you'd feel awfully good
if you squared yourself back home.

37:10.383 --> 37:12.952
I'm satisfied here.
Why would I want to go back?

37:14.625 --> 37:16.604
Well, that little old
lady back in New York.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.436
Aren't you going to
answer her call for help?

37:22.829 --> 37:24.016
What are you getting at?

37:24.992 --> 37:26.980
They're trying to get her
fortune out of her hands.

37:27.733 --> 37:29.292
They are trying to say she is insane.

37:30.527 --> 37:31.428
You are lying.

37:32.359 --> 37:34.007
Why don't you read the New York papers.

37:40.353 --> 37:41.368
Show this man out.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.395
If you don't mind.

37:45.084 --> 37:46.042
This way please.

37:46.466 --> 37:47.322
Not at all.

38:30.545 --> 38:32.076
If you're thinking about going back.

38:32.254 --> 38:33.853
They'll pick you up on that old rap ..

38:33.953 --> 38:36.496
And you'll spend the next 20 years
in the jug sewing mailbags.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.797
It won't be much help to the old lady.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.981
Have you been gabbing with that guy?

38:41.674 --> 38:42.389
Not me.

38:42.785 --> 38:44.955
I just happened to overhear
what you were talking about.

38:45.804 --> 38:46.619
Look, boss.

38:47.268 --> 38:49.116
Down here you are an important guy.

38:49.339 --> 38:50.612
Look at the set-up you got.

38:50.969 --> 38:53.341
A big-paying business.
It's a swell life. And ..

38:54.385 --> 38:55.371
A wonderful girl.

38:55.970 --> 38:59.287
Even if the old lady is crazy, you'd be
screwier than she is if you went back.

39:06.225 --> 39:08.603
Make a reservation for me on the
8 o'clock plane in the morning.

39:09.183 --> 39:10.827
I'm going to the States.
- But, boss ..

39:11.001 --> 39:13.075
And get in touch with the
manager of the Casa Almeida.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.633
Find out if Claire spent the
weekend in the mountains.

39:16.142 --> 39:18.065
I'm going home to change. Call me there.

39:18.528 --> 39:19.234
Okay.

39:47.013 --> 39:51.378
Have you any idea of how many toy trains
are wrecked by fathers on Christmas Day?

39:52.581 --> 39:54.927
How difficult it is to
work a railroad system.

39:55.125 --> 39:57.145
This one is over ten years old.
- Yeah.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.696
You see, one has to stay young.

40:03.529 --> 40:05.145
I guess I'm getting too old, Miss Reed.

40:05.579 --> 40:06.536
Yes, well.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.884
Pour yourself a drink
and make your report.

40:09.391 --> 40:11.236
I'll take it a little later
if you don't mind.

40:13.175 --> 40:14.791
I got the dope here on your boy, Mario.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.904
Where is he now?
- S.A. dear lady.

40:39.888 --> 40:41.012
Ah, South America.

40:41.841 --> 40:44.467
He's a lamster. He's got a 20-year rap
if he comes back to God's country.

40:46.346 --> 40:47.504
Can't you talk English?

40:48.306 --> 40:49.974
Well, our friend Mario.

40:50.249 --> 40:52.645
He stepped into a deal that
was strictly from Limburger.

40:54.214 --> 40:55.315
You understand, he ..

40:55.615 --> 40:57.431
He was in trouble about
a certain deal and ..

40:57.950 --> 40:59.202
Well, he got hot-tempered.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.465
Mario was always hot-tempered.

41:04.106 --> 41:05.350
Take my advice, dear lady.

41:05.901 --> 41:08.314
You would be better off if Michael
or Mario never come back.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.564
And who asked you for your advice, pray?

41:11.616 --> 41:13.856
I pay you to get information.
Not to interpret it.

41:17.123 --> 41:18.873
Now don't tell me you
can't find Jonathan.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.561
A man like Jonathan doesn't
just vanish into thin air.

41:23.292 --> 41:26.730
Hire a thousand detectives if you
need them to help you. But find him.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.755
You are a mother alright.

41:30.182 --> 41:31.718
If even one comes back, you'd be ..

41:31.818 --> 41:34.101
I don't care if Michael is
ashamed to come back.

41:35.064 --> 41:36.772
Or what Mario's past has been.

41:37.767 --> 41:40.042
And wherever Jonathan is,
you must find him.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.444
They've got to be here on Christmas Eve.

41:49.517 --> 41:50.503
They are my boys.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.620
And they need me.

41:56.666 --> 41:57.724
They need me.

42:09.574 --> 42:10.603
Mario.

42:24.598 --> 42:25.270
Hello?

42:25.551 --> 42:26.544
"<i>Hello, Mario?</i>"

42:27.121 --> 42:27.849
Yes.

42:29.283 --> 42:30.694
Ah .. say ..

42:31.077 --> 42:33.837
I had a kind of tough time getting hold
of the manager of that mountain place.

42:34.449 --> 42:35.094
I ..

42:36.319 --> 42:37.277
Well, he says ..

42:39.375 --> 42:41.019
Claire wasn't up there over the weekend.

42:41.453 --> 42:42.296
You're sure?

42:43.090 --> 42:44.935
"<i>That's what the guy said.
That's all I know</i>."

42:45.102 --> 42:45.800
Okay.

43:36.453 --> 43:38.729
Your obstinacy has become quite trying.

43:39.778 --> 43:42.736
I dislike using persuasive methods.

43:43.713 --> 43:44.499
But you ..

43:45.184 --> 43:46.829
You force me to do so.

43:50.257 --> 43:52.763
You know nothing about
the beautiful Fräulein.

43:53.715 --> 43:54.436
Really?

43:55.592 --> 43:58.176
I am tired of hearing you say that.

44:01.352 --> 44:02.681
Such a lovely girl.

44:04.123 --> 44:04.966
So wealthy.

44:06.311 --> 44:09.110
Together you must have
had such wonderful times.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.514
Spending her money.

44:12.228 --> 44:13.834
You don't know what I'm talking about.

44:15.549 --> 44:17.719
You don't know where
the money came from ..

44:17.959 --> 44:20.294
That built your magnificent nightclub.

44:21.831 --> 44:24.947
You shut your eyes and
thought it .. just grew.

44:27.936 --> 44:30.872
Now you are going to the States
taking the rest of it with you.

44:31.746 --> 44:33.661
And she will meet you
there later perhaps.

44:35.263 --> 44:36.943
I don't know what you are talking about.

44:37.043 --> 44:38.012
What a pity.

44:41.338 --> 44:43.256
Let me refresh your memory.

44:44.837 --> 44:48.538
I sent her here with ten million
dollars in cash and jewels.

44:50.332 --> 44:51.061
One day.

44:51.363 --> 44:53.105
I told her .. I will come for it.

44:53.886 --> 44:55.829
To enjoy our fortune together.

44:57.423 --> 44:58.266
I have come.

45:00.382 --> 45:01.343
But the money?

45:02.417 --> 45:03.562
Where has it gone?

45:06.450 --> 45:07.490
Has it two legs?

45:08.207 --> 45:09.809
Has it wings? Has it?

45:10.647 --> 45:11.548
How do I know?

45:25.294 --> 45:25.984
Now.

45:26.571 --> 45:27.643
Let's start afresh.

45:28.253 --> 45:29.268
Think carefully.

45:30.243 --> 45:32.188
What has she told you about our affair?

45:32.888 --> 45:33.624
Nothing.

45:34.818 --> 45:35.750
Look, Reichman.

45:36.305 --> 45:37.891
You can work me over. You can kill me.

45:38.854 --> 45:40.699
But how can I tell you
something I don't know?

45:42.459 --> 45:43.437
Bring her in.

45:53.793 --> 45:56.075
It was very nice of
you to come, Fräulein.

45:56.684 --> 45:58.009
May I introduce you to ..

45:59.090 --> 45:59.762
Mario!

46:00.262 --> 46:01.361
Oh, but of course.

46:01.711 --> 46:04.077
I had almost forgotten
that you knew each other.

46:04.662 --> 46:05.534
What is this?

46:06.062 --> 46:08.517
I'm on my way to your house to
find out why you left the office ..

46:08.617 --> 46:10.253
And then strong-arm men pick me up.

46:11.057 --> 46:12.080
What is the score?

46:14.325 --> 46:15.330
You animal.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.227
Come now, Fräulein.

46:17.966 --> 46:19.499
If you had been more informative ..

46:19.941 --> 46:21.242
This wouldn't have happened.

46:22.306 --> 46:24.232
I can be very persuasive.

46:24.788 --> 46:27.319
Stop it, Gustav. He knows nothing
about you. Nothing about your money.

46:27.837 --> 46:29.153
With two people.

46:29.782 --> 46:30.968
As close as ..

46:32.846 --> 46:34.945
Well, that is very difficult to believe.

46:36.473 --> 46:37.459
Is all this true?

46:40.616 --> 46:41.245
Yes.

46:44.076 --> 46:47.182
A guy in a fancy uniform and
a smooth line and you fell for it.

46:49.119 --> 46:50.008
What a hero.

46:51.176 --> 46:53.048
Well, if that's what you
want you can have it.

46:54.247 --> 46:56.407
Leave him alone, Gustav.
I will tell you about the money.

46:57.235 --> 46:57.831
So.

46:59.468 --> 47:01.420
Now we are beginning to get somewhere.

47:04.259 --> 47:05.516
Darling, I was a fool.

47:06.177 --> 47:07.882
I didn't realize how rotten they were.

47:08.287 --> 47:09.428
And how rotten he was.

47:10.810 --> 47:12.254
When I came to my senses ..

47:12.481 --> 47:14.326
I swore the money would
never get back to him.

47:14.666 --> 47:15.819
I told him so tonight.

47:16.108 --> 47:18.883
I am not interested in your
sentiments, Fräulein.

47:20.035 --> 47:21.336
Gustav, I'll make a bargain.

47:22.392 --> 47:24.787
If you will let him go, I will
tell you where the money is.

47:25.786 --> 47:27.873
Now you are sensible, my liebchen.

47:28.661 --> 47:29.590
Do you promise?

47:29.788 --> 47:30.665
Why not?

47:31.563 --> 47:32.940
He is no longer important.

47:34.351 --> 47:34.994
Well?

47:35.408 --> 47:36.879
It's in a bank in St Julian.

47:37.793 --> 47:39.113
St Julian?
- Yes.

47:39.793 --> 47:41.037
Now, please cut him loose.

47:43.323 --> 47:44.647
You are too impulsive.

47:45.594 --> 47:47.110
A charming trait but ..

47:47.556 --> 47:48.399
Impractical.

47:49.547 --> 47:52.163
First, I must have
proof of what you say.

47:55.815 --> 47:58.297
This is the key to the strongbox.

47:58.707 --> 48:00.151
It's in the wardrobe at my house.

48:00.381 --> 48:01.896
You'll find the bank receipt there.

48:02.097 --> 48:03.341
Now cut him loose, please.

48:03.919 --> 48:05.523
First, I must see the receipt.

48:06.421 --> 48:08.009
You heard the lady. Hurry.

48:09.191 --> 48:11.602
You mean .. you mean Mario
must wait until that man returns?

48:12.036 --> 48:13.093
Mario must wait.

48:14.759 --> 48:15.888
Don't let him kid you.

48:16.538 --> 48:17.966
He isn't going to turn me loose.

48:18.416 --> 48:20.636
To let you go ashore and
notify the authorities?

48:22.013 --> 48:25.209
Of course, I could put you ashore
somewhere along the coast.

48:26.017 --> 48:27.004
But you won't.

48:27.463 --> 48:28.306
But I won't.

48:28.686 --> 48:30.760
Gustav, you can't do this.
You promised to let him go.

48:31.472 --> 48:34.834
Promises my dear lady are
the counterfeit currency ..

48:35.426 --> 48:38.163
That inferior people
exact from each other.

48:38.802 --> 48:41.020
When unsure of their own strength.

48:48.165 --> 48:49.867
Tell the engineer to
warm up the engines.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.206
You mean you are sailing?

48:52.306 --> 48:54.691
As soon as my man returns
with your bank receipt.

48:55.536 --> 48:56.894
You sure walked into that one.

48:57.522 --> 48:58.194
Did I?

48:58.630 --> 49:00.103
Well, we'll settle this right now.

49:01.165 --> 49:03.267
You never had any intention
of letting him go, did you?

49:04.118 --> 49:05.724
The sea is a quiet place.

49:06.475 --> 49:07.576
And it has no tongue.

49:08.597 --> 49:09.412
As for you?

49:09.893 --> 49:12.057
After you have returned
my money back to me.

49:12.493 --> 49:13.222
Perhaps.

49:13.616 --> 49:15.226
Well, you won't find it that easy.

49:16.235 --> 49:18.447
Because I promised to tell
you only where your money is.

49:19.062 --> 49:20.373
Not who is going to get it.

49:20.780 --> 49:21.909
Who is to get it then?

49:22.395 --> 49:24.458
The American Occupation
Authorities in Berlin.

49:27.503 --> 49:29.081
That's where I went over the weekend.

49:29.487 --> 49:30.366
To St Julian.

49:31.393 --> 49:33.530
To make final arrangements
for sending the money back.

49:34.952 --> 49:37.854
I knew when he found out about it
my life would be worthless but I ..

49:38.315 --> 49:39.421
I tried to save you.

49:40.371 --> 49:41.729
That's why I left your office.

49:42.286 --> 49:43.759
To make you think the worst of me.

49:44.044 --> 49:45.259
And keep you out of this.

49:46.091 --> 49:49.239
All I wanted to do, all I could think
of was to .. to get right with myself.

49:49.614 --> 49:50.658
To settle my score.

49:51.229 --> 49:52.072
Lock him up.

49:59.696 --> 50:00.579
Oh yes.

50:01.283 --> 50:04.664
You are worrying about the
charming Fräulein Claire.

50:06.006 --> 50:08.060
What will happen to
her is something that ..

50:08.440 --> 50:11.222
I am sure a clever man like
you can well figure out.

50:15.201 --> 50:16.009
Sit down.

51:10.876 --> 51:11.998
[ Gunshots! ]

51:17.073 --> 51:18.324
The engines are stopping.

51:19.533 --> 51:20.307
Yes.

51:35.973 --> 51:37.692
Your friend is fast, Fräulein.

51:38.627 --> 51:40.130
But when he tries to come in here.

51:40.927 --> 51:41.999
First you, then him.

53:36.331 --> 53:37.868
If the Germans have a fault.

53:38.658 --> 53:40.736
It is that sometimes perhaps they ..

53:41.080 --> 53:42.873
Underestimate their enemies.

53:44.662 --> 53:46.613
It will not happen again.

53:57.460 --> 53:58.324
[ Gunshot! ]

54:12.622 --> 54:13.429
Claire.

54:17.845 --> 54:18.701
Darling.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.817
Have I made myself right with you?

54:23.189 --> 54:23.893
Have I?

54:24.551 --> 54:25.537
You bet you have.

54:26.485 --> 54:27.685
Oh. I am so glad.

54:30.128 --> 54:31.680
Mario, hold me closer.

54:35.730 --> 54:36.589
Mario.

54:38.331 --> 54:39.174
Have you ..?

54:42.143 --> 54:42.916
Claire.

55:14.710 --> 55:16.402
Seen anybody that looks like him yet?

55:16.852 --> 55:17.438
No.

55:18.176 --> 55:19.839
Not even remotely like Jonathan.

55:20.352 --> 55:21.738
There is more film, Miss Reed.

55:21.862 --> 55:23.735
Maybe one of them will
be your little Buckaroo.

55:35.489 --> 55:36.247
Jonathan!

55:37.022 --> 55:38.935
That is Jonathan.
Look Williams, there he is.

55:39.210 --> 55:40.730
Yes Madam, I see him. I see him.

55:41.952 --> 55:43.989
My now, doesn't he look fine.

55:44.355 --> 55:45.656
Wonderful, madam. Wonderful.

55:46.468 --> 55:47.254
Jonathan.

55:48.384 --> 55:49.428
Let us out of here.

55:54.291 --> 55:55.699
Go on, Jonathan.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.727
Ride him, cowboy. Ride him.

55:58.047 --> 55:59.732
Jonathan, that's the boy.

56:08.910 --> 56:10.885
Get up off that ground
Jonathan and ride it.

56:14.255 --> 56:15.957
Shall I rewind it Madam
and run it again?

56:16.584 --> 56:18.594
We are going to run that fifty times.
- Yes, madam.

56:18.978 --> 56:20.365
What are you sitting there for?

56:20.612 --> 56:22.171
You've found him. Now go and get him.

56:27.835 --> 56:29.168
Hurry up, Williams. Hurry up.

56:29.451 --> 56:31.676
I am rewinding it as
fast as I can, madam.

56:52.854 --> 56:53.962
Perfect, Williams.

56:54.892 --> 56:57.443
It is a perfect Christmas punch.
- Thank you, madam.

56:58.108 --> 57:01.078
Oh, are there any further orders
for Robert before we leave?

57:01.329 --> 57:02.305
Huh? Robert?

57:02.840 --> 57:03.575
Robert.

57:06.687 --> 57:07.673
Remember, Robert.

57:07.953 --> 57:10.164
When Williams brings
Mr Jonathan to the car.

57:10.676 --> 57:13.604
You must conduct yourself as
though he had never gone away.

57:13.941 --> 57:14.756
Yes, ma'am.

57:14.870 --> 57:18.224
I even have the packet of aniseed
to give to him before he kisses you.

57:19.130 --> 57:22.002
Well, he may not be
ashamed of drinking now.

57:28.046 --> 57:29.125
What are you up to?

57:29.225 --> 57:31.910
We are meeting Mr Jonathan, sir.
At Grand Central station.

57:33.905 --> 57:36.511
Judge Alston, a very
Merry Christmas to you.

57:37.262 --> 57:40.080
Bless my soul, what a Christmas Eve.

57:41.562 --> 57:44.403
My chauffeur has gone to the
station to meet my son Jonathan.

57:44.919 --> 57:47.492
They had better lead him
blindfold past the saloons.

57:47.952 --> 57:49.675
And what about the others?

57:50.806 --> 57:52.379
Oh, they will be here.

57:53.069 --> 57:53.957
I'm sure.

57:55.867 --> 57:57.082
Shall we drink a toast ..

57:57.454 --> 57:58.694
To their safe arrival.

58:43.597 --> 58:45.504
Why, it's old Bill himself.

58:46.058 --> 58:47.756
Jonathan.
- How is ma?

58:47.964 --> 58:51.183
Miss Matilda will be even better when
she realises how strong you are, sir.

58:51.410 --> 58:53.216
The car is here.
- Is Robert still driving?

58:53.494 --> 58:55.864
He insisted upon coming this
afternoon sir, in your honor.

58:56.062 --> 58:58.750
Oh. Then let's get him and
have a little snort in his honor.

58:58.935 --> 59:00.581
Robert has to stay with the car, sir.

59:00.822 --> 59:03.069
Then we'll take him his
share in a paper cup.

59:22.012 --> 59:23.056
Sit down, Williams.

59:24.153 --> 59:25.254
Any labelled whiskey?

59:26.482 --> 59:29.433
Give us two glasses full with an
extra in a big paper cup to take out.

59:30.547 --> 59:32.888
It's against the law to take
liquor off the premises, sir.

59:43.015 --> 59:45.142
Hold on there, stranger. Keep pouring.

01:00:02.312 --> 01:00:04.528
That ain't for Robert.
Go on and drink it, Williams.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.514
Need a little help?

01:00:35.743 --> 01:00:37.836
Shall we go now, sir?
- Where do we go?

01:00:38.062 --> 01:00:40.194
The liquor is good. Pretty scenery.

01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:45.713
Miss Matilda will be alarmed, sir.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.971
Oh, I forgot. Hey, partner.

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.671
Keep the change. Come on.

01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.042
Thanks.

01:00:52.511 --> 01:00:54.916
Who will give me two dollars
for this priceless bassinet?

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:58.108
When for we know some great American
might have been rocked to sleep in it.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:00.343
Perhaps even George Washington.

01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:02.840
Two dollars.
- Two dollars and four bits.

01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:04.560
I'm bid two dollars and four bits.

01:01:04.808 --> 01:01:05.709
Five dollars.

01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:10.028
Four bits isn't four dollars. All you
had to bid was two dollars and six bits.

01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:11.817
Going once for five dollars.

01:01:12.018 --> 01:01:14.329
Going twice for five dollars.
- Five dollars and two bits.

01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:16.900
Five dollars and four bits.
- Five dollars and six bits.

01:01:17.752 --> 01:01:18.585
It's yours.

01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:21.351
Going for five, six bits.
Going twice for five, six bits.

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:24.337
Sold to the gentlemen for
five dollars and 75 cents.

01:01:27.628 --> 01:01:28.708
Here is six bucks.

01:01:28.887 --> 01:01:30.274
Keep the two bits for yourself.

01:01:30.398 --> 01:01:32.453
Here is your priceless treasure, sir.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.735
What's your hurry, ma'am?

01:01:40.727 --> 01:01:42.846
I want to give you this,
this rock-a-bye thing.

01:01:43.779 --> 01:01:44.565
Why, sure.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.096
I only bid like that to stop someone
else rustling it away at a higher price.

01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:51.519
Besides, I wanted to meet you.

01:01:52.836 --> 01:01:54.695
Maybe you will do after all.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.429
Yes! I'll take a chance on you.

01:01:57.739 --> 01:01:59.044
A chance on what?
- Ah!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.626
What is the matter, ma'am?

01:02:00.894 --> 01:02:03.331
At 6 o'clock I am going
to become a mother.

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:04.347
A mother?

01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:05.904
And it's your fault.

01:02:06.401 --> 01:02:07.616
My fault?
- If I'm late.

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.612
You won't be late, ma'am. I'll take you.
- Really, sir. Aunt Matilda is waiting.

01:02:11.884 --> 01:02:14.174
Williams, I can't leave the lady.
She's about to have a baby.

01:02:14.274 --> 01:02:15.896
Well, let's not be excited, sir.

01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:17.563
I've had three myself.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.312
Would you like us to call
a policeman, madam?

01:02:20.412 --> 01:02:21.280
A policeman?

01:02:21.668 --> 01:02:23.740
Are you afraid to take me
there without a policeman?

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.666
Why ma'am, I'll be glad
to take you anywhere.

01:02:25.802 --> 01:02:27.622
But really, sir. Your aunt. I mean ..

01:02:28.497 --> 01:02:30.320
We could never explain this delay.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:32.273
We haven't time to explain, Williams.

01:02:32.602 --> 01:02:33.731
I've got to get going.

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:35.302
Yes, we've got to get going.

01:02:35.409 --> 01:02:36.624
Quick, Williams. The car.

01:02:39.758 --> 01:02:40.945
Where do you wish to go?

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:43.007
128 West Meredith Street.

01:02:43.251 --> 01:02:45.096
128 West Meredith Street.
- Tell him to hurry.

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:48.714
I've always heard it ain't best to
drive fast under these conditions.

01:02:49.064 --> 01:02:50.337
It's all set for 6 o'clock.

01:02:50.697 --> 01:02:52.513
Where I come from they
don't go by the clock.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.023
They just sort of, well ..

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.268
Take you by surprise, natural like.

01:02:56.665 --> 01:02:57.516
I know.

01:02:57.866 --> 01:03:00.332
But stick with me, cowboy.
This is something special.

01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:02.176
Oh sure. You know ..

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.386
You kind-of had me
wondering at first, but ..

01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:07.234
I guess I know now why you were
so anxious to get that cradle.

01:03:08.502 --> 01:03:10.869
Won't you please take it from
me as a gift to the little fellow?

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.425
Look. Can't you make them hurry?

01:03:15.964 --> 01:03:18.143
I simply must be
there on time or I'll ..

01:03:18.584 --> 01:03:19.690
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:21.344 --> 01:03:22.822
Put the spurs to them, Robert.

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:35.717
If ..

01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:38.310
If you and your husband don't
mind me saying, ma'am.

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:40.467
You are an awfully pretty little mare.
- My husband?

01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:43.433
Oh. Oh yes, My husband.

01:03:45.226 --> 01:03:46.212
Thanks, stranger.

01:03:46.766 --> 01:03:48.326
You are kind of pretty yourself.

01:03:50.574 --> 01:03:52.734
Maybe the fresh air will
give you a little extra time.

01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.330
Mr Jonathan.

01:04:08.522 --> 01:04:11.400
Be careful, she'll pin more things
on you than she will on the baby.

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:14.957
Now look, lady. I ..

01:04:15.057 --> 01:04:16.815
Please, not right here on the sidewalk.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.851
Give it a real ring.
- No. No.

01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:28.752
Everything must be very discreet.

01:04:29.545 --> 01:04:31.925
It is quite an illegal proposition.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:35.249
Maybe I've gone as far as I should go.

01:04:35.702 --> 01:04:38.530
Are you going to abandon me now
after things have gone this far?

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:43.694
Yes?

01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:46.629
Can I have a baby now,
and take it away with me?

01:04:47.598 --> 01:04:49.478
I've heard of Indian
squaws doing that but ..

01:04:49.578 --> 01:04:50.450
Who sent you?

01:04:50.565 --> 01:04:51.866
Does it make any difference?

01:04:52.114 --> 01:04:54.978
Please forgive him.
A prospective father. Highly nervous.

01:04:55.598 --> 01:04:57.246
Hadn't we better get inside?

01:05:07.605 --> 01:05:09.135
The doctor will be here in a moment.

01:05:13.072 --> 01:05:14.932
I think you'd better
relax on this couch.

01:05:19.034 --> 01:05:19.620
Oh.

01:05:21.575 --> 01:05:23.373
Isn't this going to be wonderful.

01:05:24.449 --> 01:05:25.107
Papa.

01:05:27.482 --> 01:05:29.016
What's this all about, Mama?

01:05:29.322 --> 01:05:30.595
We've come to adopt a baby.

01:05:31.087 --> 01:05:34.533
You must pretend to be my husband.
- Pretend? Well, that ain't hard.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:38.756
We must be a childless, loving couple
or they will never let us adopt one.

01:05:39.162 --> 01:05:41.428
Then that game you played
at the station, that was just ..?

01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:42.157
Yes.

01:05:43.499 --> 01:05:45.664
Oh please, play it my way.
Just for five minutes.

01:05:47.522 --> 01:05:48.886
Trust me?
- Sure I do.

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.533
Just as long as you don't try
to pin down my gun hand.

01:05:52.935 --> 01:05:54.973
Yes. Please, let's be a loving couple.

01:05:55.855 --> 01:05:56.813
My name is Jean.

01:05:58.974 --> 01:06:00.195
And mine is Jonathan.

01:06:03.124 --> 01:06:04.768
There are hopeless babies in this house.

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:06.675
Lying in their cribs defenceless.

01:06:07.408 --> 01:06:10.682
Each day it's one baby's turn to be sold
over the counter to the highest bidder.

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.100
It's a shame a girl like
you has to buy one.

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.034
Did you pick me out because I looked ..

01:06:15.134 --> 01:06:18.680
I picked you out because you looked
the part of a big, tender-hearted hero.

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:22.136
Ain't you putting too
much jam on the bread?

01:06:22.807 --> 01:06:23.818
No. No.

01:06:24.619 --> 01:06:25.577
It's all in fun.

01:06:25.826 --> 01:06:27.122
I'm not complaining.

01:06:28.014 --> 01:06:29.999
I'm only doing this in
case somebody is spying.

01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:33.186
I don't mind it under any circumstances.

01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:36.603
Care to make it a lifetime job?

01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:39.795
Now, don't let being a prospective
father go to your head, stranger.

01:06:42.673 --> 01:06:43.831
Good evening.
- Howdy.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:45.990
Now don't be bashful, Jonathan.

01:06:46.743 --> 01:06:48.612
We'd like to look at
some of your yearlings.

01:06:48.712 --> 01:06:49.756
Who sent you here?

01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:51.953
We were told to say "Max"
and ask to see Dr Bunyan.

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:53.190
I'm Dr Bunyan.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:54.627
You see how it is, doc.

01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:57.660
We've been married now 5 or 6 months
and we don't have a single baby.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.037
Oh, he means 5 or 6 <i>years</i>.

01:07:01.624 --> 01:07:03.372
I'm afraid I don't like
your looks, madam.

01:07:03.605 --> 01:07:06.216
She doesn't like your looks either,
but we didn't come to adopt you.

01:07:06.478 --> 01:07:09.305
You threaten me in my own house?
- He is so quick tempered, doctor.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.375
It's because he's never
had any children.

01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:12.871
I bid you good evening.

01:07:14.023 --> 01:07:15.582
Raise the hands to the perpendicular.

01:07:16.173 --> 01:07:18.991
I came here to buy my little wife a baby
and by golly, I'm going to buy her one.

01:07:19.455 --> 01:07:21.773
Come on honey, let's go to the
corral and look at his stock.

01:07:21.873 --> 01:07:24.127
Jonathan, this is no way to
go about adopting a baby.

01:07:24.552 --> 01:07:25.967
What makes you so trigger happy?

01:07:26.374 --> 01:07:29.421
Put back that cannon before I take it
from you and spank your little hand.

01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:34.200
I'm sorry, Doc. But you know
how it is with expectant fathers.

01:07:34.744 --> 01:07:36.702
I admit it is a little irregular but ..

01:07:38.857 --> 01:07:41.334
We are prepared to make
it worth your while.

01:07:42.946 --> 01:07:45.239
A hundred white-faced heifers
for one little pink-face calf.

01:07:46.092 --> 01:07:48.926
Well, right now we have only
three baby girls up for adoption.

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:52.984
You understand everything must be legal
before we can entrust you with a child.

01:07:53.306 --> 01:07:55.147
Why, you talk like a horse thief.
- Jonathan.

01:07:56.367 --> 01:07:57.296
Please, doctor.

01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:01.945
Well, if you'll follow me.
I'll let you <i>look</i> at our babies.

01:08:07.902 --> 01:08:09.273
Oh, Jonathan.

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:11.089
Why, hello blue-eyes.

01:08:11.403 --> 01:08:12.802
What happened to your hair?

01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:19.469
It's time you were weaned and
given the run of the range.

01:08:20.307 --> 01:08:23.345
Oh, they are all adorable.
- Don't touch the children, please.

01:08:23.977 --> 01:08:26.669
Ah, that's what they need. Someone
like her to love them and kiss them.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.749
That's no way to hold a baby.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.001
What the cattle-men out my way
wouldn't give to have you around.

01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:48.990
Any reduction if I take the whole herd?

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:52.051
You can't even take one without
the proper adoption papers.

01:08:52.282 --> 01:08:53.821
I haven't seen any brand on them.

01:08:54.019 --> 01:08:55.270
Where's your bill of sale?

01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:58.075
I told you not to mind him, doctor.
He is frustrated.

01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:00.403
If we pay the adoption costs ..

01:09:00.823 --> 01:09:04.256
And leave money to cover expenses for
the necessary steps you have to take ..

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:05.576
Don't get me wrong, sir.

01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:09.788
I feel sure this lady is an investigator
for a busybody humane society.

01:09:10.267 --> 01:09:11.883
That she brought you along as a stooge.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.671
Out of respect for this man's sincerity
and his obvious wholesomeness ..

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:18.290
You are both free to go,
before I call the police.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.933
Is what he says true?

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.768
Are you working for the police?

01:09:27.234 --> 01:09:28.971
Well, in a way I am.

01:09:31.582 --> 01:09:32.569
Can you prove it?

01:09:33.948 --> 01:09:36.987
Here is a fire pass, a police card
and the rest of my credentials.

01:09:43.974 --> 01:09:45.481
Now let's see your doctor's papers.

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:48.149
Well, if you'll come with me I will
be glad to show you my credentials.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:54.569
This way, sir.

01:10:06.811 --> 01:10:08.942
They have a car waiting outside.
- I'll take care of it.

01:10:34.121 --> 01:10:35.796
Operator, get me the police.

01:10:38.414 --> 01:10:39.869
You lousy little rat, you.

01:10:40.082 --> 01:10:42.515
What are you trying to do, murder her?
- Come on, get her up here.

01:11:19.653 --> 01:11:21.495
Well, what's the matter, kids?

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:25.693
Now brown-eyes, take it easy.
Everything is going to be fine.

01:11:27.141 --> 01:11:27.784
Fine.

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.192
Jean.

01:12:02.972 --> 01:12:03.615
Jean!

01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:20.544
Look, girls. I can't leave you here.

01:12:21.033 --> 01:12:23.592
I know of three other kids that
were fished out of a joint like this.

01:12:27.487 --> 01:12:28.586
[ Buzzer ]

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.557
What do you say we all stick together?

01:12:37.838 --> 01:12:38.857
That's the girl.

01:12:43.645 --> 01:12:44.753
Alright boys.

01:12:57.594 --> 01:12:58.495
Why, Williams.

01:12:58.731 --> 01:13:02.306
That preposterous doctor sir,
tried to sell us a load of clams.

01:13:03.627 --> 01:13:05.043
So we had to leave, Mr Jonathan.

01:13:05.852 --> 01:13:09.516
Then we took the liberty of assuming
you would be leaving by the back way.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:10.908
Good point.

01:13:11.133 --> 01:13:12.622
What have you in the basket, sir?

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.409
Babies, Williams. Babies.
- In the plural?

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:17.738
I have suddenly become
the father of three children.

01:13:22.109 --> 01:13:23.780
Take a look upstairs, Paul.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:31.951 --> 01:13:33.219
Find the light switch.

01:13:36.016 --> 01:13:38.829
Quick, Williams. Let's get out of here.
- Certainly, sir. We can take a powder.

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:04.174
What happened to you, Miss?

01:14:04.788 --> 01:14:06.549
I came here to investigate
a baby racket.

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:07.685
All on your own?

01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.598
Has someone looked after the babies?

01:14:09.891 --> 01:14:11.427
You're the only baby around here.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.537
We found these two runners
down the street, Sergeant.

01:14:16.793 --> 01:14:18.523
We thought you might
want to talk to them.

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:20.994
That heel.

01:14:21.807 --> 01:14:23.792
That cheap heel stole my babies.

01:14:53.033 --> 01:14:55.489
Miss Matilda, it's been
an hour and a half.

01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:59.481
My grandchildren will never forgive
me if I don't help them trim the tree.

01:14:59.847 --> 01:15:02.401
You can't go until my three boys arrive.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.890
I am sure of that.
- Phillip.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.228
You must take good care of your aunt
Matilda in this terrible disappointment.

01:15:10.174 --> 01:15:12.024
Sometime after the holidays.

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:13.556
We will ..

01:15:14.573 --> 01:15:15.588
Jonathan.

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.422
I got here, Mom.

01:15:26.384 --> 01:15:27.757
Jonathan.

01:15:31.553 --> 01:15:34.582
Oh that's nothing, Mom.
I just cut myself while shaving.

01:15:37.004 --> 01:15:40.134
There is just no knowing what my
boy has been through to get here.

01:15:40.596 --> 01:15:43.673
Mom, let's not stand here on the
sidewalk. Let's go into the saloon.

01:15:47.395 --> 01:15:49.211
A real Merry Christmas to you.

01:15:50.419 --> 01:15:51.520
Same to you, Phillip.

01:15:51.928 --> 01:15:54.232
I have a charming
interest in this youngster.

01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:56.651
Will someone tell me what
I am to do with it next.

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:57.928
Let me have it.

01:15:59.083 --> 01:16:01.331
What do you think of
the family? All girls.

01:16:01.919 --> 01:16:04.331
Wonderful, Jonathan. Wonderful.

01:16:06.463 --> 01:16:08.116
Edith.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:16:10.989 --> 01:16:11.940
Darling.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:16.834
Robert.

01:16:17.097 --> 01:16:21.471
You must go to the drugstore to get some
formula and nursing bottles right away.

01:16:22.722 --> 01:16:24.430
Oh, sweetheart.

01:16:25.797 --> 01:16:28.092
And Edith, you sterilise
those bottles thoroughly.

01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:32.191
We'll put them right to bed
upstairs in the old nursery.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.010
It will be like old times.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:38.920
Except there will be three
little fillies in the old corral.

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:43.828
Sorry I'm late, Mom. But I had to swing
my rope round those three little strays.

01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:46.426
Jonathan, this is Judge Alston.

01:16:47.563 --> 01:16:50.379
It's not the first time I've been
face to face with a judge.

01:16:50.747 --> 01:16:53.349
Now tell us all about your
three lovely little girls.

01:16:53.856 --> 01:16:56.003
Well, Mom. It was this way.

01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:59.067
The only woman I ever loved
was a girl named Tricky.

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:02.795
She got killed bulldogging a
steer at the Pendleton Round-Up.

01:17:04.523 --> 01:17:05.824
And when I went to bury her.

01:17:06.138 --> 01:17:07.545
My shovel hit a goldmine.

01:17:07.988 --> 01:17:09.780
A vein of pure ore.

01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:12.129
Three feet thick.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:18.883
Now that I've struck it rich and
got me a big 30-room house I ..

01:17:19.414 --> 01:17:21.978
Well, I don't want to get lonesome
so I arranged to pick up ..

01:17:22.391 --> 01:17:23.807
Ten or fifteen head of children.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.165
Orphan children.
- Orphan children.

01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:29.386
Have you the proper adoption
papers for these children?

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.191
Can't they grow up without them?

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:35.410
I am very happy one
of your sons got here.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.804
But madam, now I must be going.

01:17:38.761 --> 01:17:39.710
There he is!

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:43.960
Still wearing those
phony cowboy clothes.

01:17:44.348 --> 01:17:45.420
Where's my babies?

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.915
Aren't you interested in me
with my skull broken open?

01:17:48.103 --> 01:17:48.698
No.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.575
Aren't you Isaiah
Bradford's granddaughter?

01:17:50.853 --> 01:17:54.202
Miss Matilda, I'm sorry to intrude ..
- Jean, are you mixed up in this?

01:17:54.451 --> 01:17:56.382
I'm glad you're on their
trail too, Judge Alston.

01:17:56.528 --> 01:17:58.115
There is the meanest man in the world.

01:17:58.338 --> 01:18:00.470
A baby thief.
- Now look here, Jean.

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:02.542
The Judge knows all
about my coming here ..

01:18:02.642 --> 01:18:05.177
To adopt a small herd of children
to take to my place out west.

01:18:06.078 --> 01:18:08.123
Why, you are not going to
believe that, Judge Alston?

01:18:08.862 --> 01:18:11.318
You weren't even thinking of
babies when I picked you up.

01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:14.689
Why honey, you didn't pick me up.
I just took you along for the ride.

01:18:15.199 --> 01:18:18.163
Going up there to pick up a few little
mavericks and put my brand on them.

01:18:18.648 --> 01:18:22.135
Just out of gratitude for the way aunt
Matilda raised her three little strays.

01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:24.914
Tell this madman, Judge,
they are <i>my</i> babies.

01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:27.677
I need them for evidence.
- Evidence? What evidence?

01:18:28.338 --> 01:18:30.753
I was on an assignment for
the Welfare Association.

01:18:31.031 --> 01:18:32.477
Adopt a child, pay for it.

01:18:33.046 --> 01:18:35.237
And crack open that phony
baby adoption racket.

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:37.116
But I needed a husband.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.738
And he looked so big and strong and ..

01:18:41.277 --> 01:18:42.366
Where are my babies?

01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:45.014
They are safe in bed
upstairs in the nursery.

01:18:48.854 --> 01:18:50.307
Thank you for bringing them here.

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:55.089
Sorry if I was a little
rough on you but ..

01:18:55.544 --> 01:18:58.313
You see, it just so happens
that I am interested in babies.

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:02.637
Ma'am, if you are that much interested
in babies it is time we got acquainted.

01:19:04.818 --> 01:19:06.033
You see how it is, Judge?

01:19:06.185 --> 01:19:07.678
And he is the best of the three.

01:19:13.176 --> 01:19:15.135
Now look, Miss. You have
got to make up your mind.

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:17.120
I have.

01:19:17.344 --> 01:19:18.817
The babies. What about the babies?

01:19:19.099 --> 01:19:21.259
The whole thing is in Judge
Alston's hands now, Sergeant.

01:19:24.117 --> 01:19:25.745
They're nuts. Just plain nuts.

01:19:25.952 --> 01:19:27.039
I beg your pardon?

01:19:38.282 --> 01:19:40.783
Why don't you go in where it's warm
with the rest of the screwballs?

01:19:40.883 --> 01:19:42.041
Because I like it here.

01:19:49.245 --> 01:19:50.736
I waited to see if you'd show up.

01:19:50.925 --> 01:19:51.977
You bingo player.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:54.760
Now, Ann. Not in front
of aunt Matilda's house.

01:19:54.932 --> 01:19:55.910
Aunt Matilda?

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:57.400
Haven't you done enough damage?

01:19:57.587 --> 01:19:59.511
If you go in there you
will ruin that old lady.

01:19:59.611 --> 01:20:01.302
Besides, they'll throw the book at you.

01:20:01.402 --> 01:20:03.141
Book or no book, it's Christmas Eve.

01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:06.594
If you go in, I'll tear you to pieces.
- Alright, tear me to pieces.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.358
But in here, where it is warm.

01:20:09.196 --> 01:20:10.292
Mr Michael.

01:20:12.323 --> 01:20:15.807
Miss Reed, I am very sorry
but I can't wait any longer.

01:20:18.503 --> 01:20:22.089
But you've only seen one of my boys and
you promised to meet all three of them.

01:20:22.343 --> 01:20:23.478
But, madam.

01:20:26.946 --> 01:20:27.675
Michael.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.432
It's Michael.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:35.272
I hope you don't mind my muscling in.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:38.734
Michael.

01:20:40.265 --> 01:20:41.272
Judge Alston.

01:20:41.607 --> 01:20:43.291
This is Michael, my second son.

01:20:43.516 --> 01:20:44.678
Sorry I am late, sir.

01:20:46.677 --> 01:20:47.892
Merry Christmas, Phillip.

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.664
I didn't think you would have the nerve.

01:20:50.081 --> 01:20:52.018
And you, my dear?
- I'm Ann Nelson.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:53.476
I came here because ..

01:20:54.164 --> 01:20:55.628
Because Ann is my fiancée.

01:20:56.466 --> 01:20:57.242
Fiancée?

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.413
Yes. I asked her to marry
me in Phillip's office.

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:02.341
And very good stock too.

01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:04.983
We need new blood in the family.

01:21:05.763 --> 01:21:07.300
In fact .. Phillip.

01:21:08.256 --> 01:21:09.910
You didn't tell me you had seen Michael.

01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:12.146
I didn't want to break
your heart, aunt Matilda.

01:21:12.679 --> 01:21:14.617
He bilked me out of $10,000 cash.

01:21:14.797 --> 01:21:17.410
Besides quoting $75,000 worth of rubber.

01:21:17.621 --> 01:21:19.406
Yeah, and speaking of rubber.

01:21:19.843 --> 01:21:22.537
Have you still got that factory
3,000 miles up the Amazon ..

01:21:22.637 --> 01:21:24.099
And that Rayon plant in Canada?

01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:26.708
You know, I spent $10,000
trying to find those.

01:21:27.662 --> 01:21:31.000
Phillip, you should be ashamed of
stealing money from aunt Matilda.

01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:32.253
Dreamboat.

01:21:32.928 --> 01:21:33.657
Michael.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:35.686
I want you to stop it.

01:21:40.282 --> 01:21:41.946
There is no Rayon factory in Canada.

01:21:42.543 --> 01:21:44.016
And there is no rubber plantation.

01:21:44.998 --> 01:21:47.165
I've known what Phillip
was doing all the time.

01:21:47.962 --> 01:21:49.378
But it is none of your business.

01:21:51.396 --> 01:21:52.669
That's right, aunt Matilda.

01:21:52.902 --> 01:21:54.336
Make Michael stop picking on me.

01:21:55.635 --> 01:21:56.518
Judge Alston.

01:21:57.157 --> 01:21:59.315
If Phillip had the ability
to go out in the world ..

01:21:59.805 --> 01:22:01.117
And make his own way.

01:22:01.773 --> 01:22:03.438
As my three boys have done.

01:22:04.788 --> 01:22:07.782
I wouldn't kick up all this fuss about
turning everything over to him.

01:22:15.062 --> 01:22:15.705
Mike.

01:22:16.075 --> 01:22:16.829
Johnny.

01:22:17.052 --> 01:22:18.321
Gee, I'm glad you made it.

01:22:18.835 --> 01:22:20.344
Look what I collected on the way.

01:22:20.444 --> 01:22:21.602
This is my son Michael.

01:22:21.876 --> 01:22:23.067
Oh. How do you do.

01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:25.883
Miss Nelson - Miss Bradford.
- Why, you are just a baby.

01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:28.078
We have three children upstairs.

01:22:34.423 --> 01:22:35.226
Listen.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.249
Do you hear that music?

01:22:47.769 --> 01:22:48.731
What music?

01:22:52.898 --> 01:22:54.272
How Mario loves that song.

01:22:55.789 --> 01:22:58.506
Aunt Matilda sometimes has
bells ringing in her head.

01:23:02.469 --> 01:23:03.822
Mario is here.

01:23:04.649 --> 01:23:06.585
[ Church bells ringing ]

01:23:08.606 --> 01:23:10.365
I suppose I don't hear
church bells either?

01:23:10.676 --> 01:23:11.787
Yes. Now you do.

01:23:14.168 --> 01:23:15.526
I'll go and meet Mario myself.

01:23:17.727 --> 01:23:20.459
I'm beginning to think
you all need guardians.

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:29.468
[ Church bells ringing ]

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.052
Mr Mario.

01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:39.475
Merry Christmas, Williams.

01:23:39.808 --> 01:23:40.793
Thank you, sir.

01:23:43.398 --> 01:23:45.157
I figured you would
head straight for here.

01:23:46.109 --> 01:23:47.555
You took an awful chance, Mario.

01:23:50.699 --> 01:23:51.457
Let's go.

01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:00.393
A little later.

01:24:01.445 --> 01:24:02.553
It's Christmas Eve.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.377
Thanks.

01:24:05.162 --> 01:24:06.950
Come on in. I want you
to meet a great lady.

01:24:13.855 --> 01:24:15.013
How are you, beautiful?

01:24:16.619 --> 01:24:17.645
You came here.

01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:21.676
You came to me in
spite of all the obstacles.

01:24:24.026 --> 01:24:25.417
Let me look at you.

01:24:26.407 --> 01:24:28.677
How are you, darling Mario?

01:24:29.035 --> 01:24:30.136
I couldn't be better.

01:24:30.605 --> 01:24:31.963
How are you? That's the thing.

01:24:32.193 --> 01:24:32.837
Fine.

01:24:33.627 --> 01:24:34.594
Just fine.

01:24:37.585 --> 01:24:38.829
I am Joe Bland, Miss Reed.

01:24:39.313 --> 01:24:40.903
My partner wanted me to meet you.

01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:43.729
But we have to leave
for Washington tonight.

01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:48.506
It was very good of you
to come, Mr Bland.

01:24:50.603 --> 01:24:52.500
Won't you please join us?
- Thank you.

01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:59.292
I didn't think he would dare.

01:25:08.018 --> 01:25:08.947
Hello, Phillip.

01:25:09.252 --> 01:25:11.079
Judge Alston, this is my son Mario.

01:25:11.342 --> 01:25:12.977
How do you do.
- How do you do, sir.

01:25:13.077 --> 01:25:14.936
And look who is here.
- Jonathan.

01:25:16.108 --> 01:25:17.785
Glad to see you.
- Glad so see <i>you</i>.

01:25:18.075 --> 01:25:19.513
Mario, I want you to meet Jean.

01:25:19.795 --> 01:25:20.696
How do you do.

01:25:20.868 --> 01:25:22.627
Well Johnny, you still
got an eye for them.

01:25:22.768 --> 01:25:24.527
He's just wearing blinders tomorrow.

01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:26.531
Michael.

01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:27.898
Good to see you, Mario.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:29.099
How are you?
- Fine.

01:25:29.219 --> 01:25:31.472
This is Ann, the future Mrs Brooks.
- It's a pleasure.

01:25:31.765 --> 01:25:33.500
Shall we all have some Christmas cheer?

01:25:35.355 --> 01:25:37.049
Children, this is Mr Bland.

01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:38.389
How do you do.

01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:42.767
Mario, Williams made this punch from
the fine New Orleans recipe you sent me.

01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:46.123
Yes, Mario. This is one of your
memories of New Orleans.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.176
A pleasant one for a change.

01:25:49.399 --> 01:25:51.101
But I have evidence here.

01:25:52.145 --> 01:25:54.124
Of some unpleasant memories.

01:25:56.087 --> 01:25:56.866
Oh yes.

01:25:57.184 --> 01:25:58.886
Phillip has always
kept close tabs on me.

01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:02.240
Come, come, children. Please.
This is Christmas Eve.

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.571
And my dream has come true.

01:26:05.201 --> 01:26:07.852
All three of my boys are here, and ..

01:26:08.347 --> 01:26:09.879
And here is the Christmas punch.

01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:15.031
I'd like to talk to you, Phillip. Now.

01:26:15.401 --> 01:26:16.187
Privately.

01:26:19.621 --> 01:26:23.040
Judge Alston, you know that diploma
I got from the Scrub Women was ..

01:26:23.239 --> 01:26:25.767
For giving them six little club houses.
- Is that so?

01:26:26.303 --> 01:26:28.239
Well. I am going to give them six more.

01:26:29.063 --> 01:26:31.093
Merry Christmas everybody.
- Merry Christmas.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.975
Mario.
- Shut up.

01:26:34.922 --> 01:26:38.030
Phillip, ten years ago I took a rap for
you for that deal in New Orleans.

01:26:38.479 --> 01:26:40.161
But Mario ..
- You ran out on me.

01:26:40.536 --> 01:26:43.575
You left me holding the dirty end of a
deal that I didn't even know you made.

01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:46.084
You had aunt Matilda
right in the middle of it.

01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:48.742
But Mario, aunt Matilda ..
- Yes, aunt Matilda.

01:26:49.206 --> 01:26:51.850
But I made it my business go get
back here in time to stop you.

01:26:52.601 --> 01:26:54.288
But you are not going to turn me in now?

01:26:54.388 --> 01:26:57.298
I wouldn't let you hurt her 10 years ago
and I'm not letting you hurt her now.

01:26:58.323 --> 01:26:58.917
No.

01:26:59.456 --> 01:27:00.786
I'm not going to turn you in.

01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:03.670
Thank you, Mario. I knew you wouldn't.

01:27:04.076 --> 01:27:05.825
Phillip, we are both
leaving town tonight.

01:27:06.715 --> 01:27:08.069
You are going first.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.482
Where is your hat and coat?

01:27:12.474 --> 01:27:15.083
And I still don't see how my
partner ever got out of it alive.

01:27:15.477 --> 01:27:16.692
It was really the most ..

01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:25.808
Sorry mother, but Phillip was
called away unexpectedly.

01:27:26.385 --> 01:27:26.978
Oh.

01:27:27.692 --> 01:27:28.850
Well, I must run along.

01:27:29.073 --> 01:27:30.431
Goodnight and Merry Christmas.

01:27:30.553 --> 01:27:32.026
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr Bland.

01:27:32.603 --> 01:27:33.748
And thank you.

01:27:35.439 --> 01:27:37.428
I'll pick you later, fellah.
- I'll be here.

01:27:38.198 --> 01:27:40.100
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:42.819
Mr Bland has told us all about Mario.

01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:45.169
And Jonathan lives in a goldmine.

01:27:45.713 --> 01:27:47.698
And Michael has found
himself a fine wife.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:52.229
And now I want to wish a
very wonderful old lady ..

01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:54.206
A Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:27:54.434 --> 01:27:56.514
Thank you so much and the
same to you, Judge Alston.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.450
Goodnight, all.
- Goodnight.

01:27:59.645 --> 01:28:02.061
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

01:28:05.006 --> 01:28:06.507
A broken-down rodeo rider.

01:28:07.409 --> 01:28:09.712
Who had to sell his saddle
to buy a Christmas dinner.

01:28:13.475 --> 01:28:14.684
And a Beau Brummell.

01:28:15.106 --> 01:28:16.862
Who will probably wind up in a garret.

01:28:17.712 --> 01:28:19.364
Just as the original playboy did.

01:28:26.627 --> 01:28:29.000
And a very important
man from South America.

01:28:30.292 --> 01:28:31.507
On his way to Washington.

01:28:33.085 --> 01:28:35.371
To close the biggest deal of his life.

01:28:38.668 --> 01:28:40.497
I told my partner he'd
meet a great lady.

01:28:44.705 --> 01:28:45.691
Dinner is served.

01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:49.067
Thank you, Williams.

01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:54.605
Well, run along children. Run along.
You heard what Williams said.

01:29:07.228 --> 01:29:08.446
I know now, Mario.

01:29:09.650 --> 01:29:11.813
That you covered up for
Phillip in New 0rleans.

01:29:13.457 --> 01:29:16.296
But I am sure everything
is going to turn out right.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.506
Mario, dear.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.343
And children, a toast.

01:29:32.665 --> 01:29:34.391
Merry Christmas to my sons.

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:36.186
To my daughters.

01:29:36.824 --> 01:29:38.241
To my grandchildren.

01:29:38.732 --> 01:29:40.602
A Merry Christmas to all.

01:30:10.185 --> 01:30:10.977
((-t-g-))
