WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:06.465
(groans)

00:08.091 --> 00:09.635
What? Can't sleep?

00:09.677 --> 00:13.973
No, I have this terrible feeling

00:09.677 --> 00:13.973
we've forgotten something.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.809
Trash, locks, lights...

00:19.269 --> 00:21.438
Oh, well, whatever it is,

00:21.480 --> 00:24.942
I'm sure it can wait

00:21.480 --> 00:24.942
till morning.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
Oh, boy.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.241
(snoring)

00:33.283 --> 00:34.785
All right, son.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.162
Son, I think you've

00:34.827 --> 00:37.162
learned your lesson.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.915
Okay.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.625
Thanks, Dad.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.087
We've got to stop

00:43.752 --> 00:46.087
doing this.

Craig's dropping off

01:21.248 --> 01:22.583
my paycheck,

01:22.624 --> 01:24.125
so I asked him

01:22.624 --> 01:24.125
to bring in the mail.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.294
I didn't think I needed

01:24.167 --> 01:26.294
to cancel the Sunday paper.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.838
Somebody's just going

01:26.336 --> 01:27.838
to steal it anyway.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.715
Sounds like we've got

01:27.880 --> 01:29.715
nothing to worry about

01:29.757 --> 01:32.217
for the next two days

01:29.757 --> 01:32.217
but having fun.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.427
Mom, Dewey's

01:32.259 --> 01:33.427
going to puke.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.512
Geez, he's thrown up four times.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.598
You'd think

01:35.554 --> 01:37.598
he'd be empty by now.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.849
We're almost there, honey.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.141
Just keep your head

01:38.891 --> 01:40.141
in the bucket.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.309
Just ten

01:40.183 --> 01:41.309
more minutes,

01:41.351 --> 01:43.144
and we'll get to spend a weekend

01:43.186 --> 01:44.354
on a real Indian reservation.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.856
Why do they

01:44.396 --> 01:45.856
have casinos?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.148
I don't know, son.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.650
Let's just thank God they do.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.986
Hey, the pool at this place

01:48.692 --> 01:50.986
looks pretty good.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.154
You guys are going

01:51.028 --> 01:53.154
to have a nice time.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.656
It's too bad Francis

01:53.196 --> 01:54.656
couldn't be here.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.324
Oh, don't you feel

01:54.698 --> 01:56.324
bad for Francis.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.160
He's the one who got himself

01:56.366 --> 01:59.160
on academic probation.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
Francis isn't going

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
anywhere this weekend.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.082
Richie, it's me.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.249
I ditched school,

02:04.291 --> 02:06.167
my family's away

02:04.291 --> 02:06.167
for the whole weekend,

02:06.209 --> 02:07.878
so I got the house to myself.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.798
Call Circus and Justin,

02:07.920 --> 02:10.798
'cause we're going to party!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.967
Sorry, dude. They're in jail.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.175
You're kidding. Why?

02:14.217 --> 02:15.552
They got caught trying to steal

02:15.594 --> 02:17.888
the giant inflatable panda

02:15.594 --> 02:17.888
from the car lot.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.180
Oh, man!

02:19.222 --> 02:21.182
That would've been great

02:19.222 --> 02:21.182
to have.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.184
Well, you can come over, right?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.352
I'm not sure.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.105
This weekend's my intervention.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.775
How long you think

02:26.187 --> 02:29.775
this is going to take, Mom?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.694
(crying)

02:32.736 --> 02:35.196
You'd better put me down

02:32.736 --> 02:35.196
as a "maybe."

02:35.238 --> 02:37.950
(sighs)

02:39.534 --> 02:43.038
Oh, man, did I overbuy

02:39.534 --> 02:43.038
on pork rinds.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.498
Oop!

02:44.539 --> 02:47.208
Oh, hey, here we go.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.208
This is nice.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.376
MALCOLM:

02:47.250 --> 02:48.376
I get the rollaway.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
DEWEY:

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
I want to sleep with Malcolm.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.922
Cool. I get the big bed

02:50.253 --> 02:51.922
for myself.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.133
Not fair. If you get

02:51.964 --> 02:54.133
the big bed, you get Dewey.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.801
That's not the way you

02:54.173 --> 02:55.801
called it, butt-head.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.511
Now, boys, I'm sure

02:55.843 --> 02:57.511
we can find a fair way

02:57.552 --> 02:59.013
to figure this out.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.306
Reese, Malcolm, Dewey.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.891
I'm taking a bath.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.144
Anybody's got to go,

03:02.933 --> 03:05.144
it's now or never.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.104
Can we go

03:05.184 --> 03:07.104
swimming, Mom?

03:05.184 --> 03:07.104
Yeah, can we?

03:07.146 --> 03:09.230
I think I might take

03:07.146 --> 03:09.230
a quick look at the casino.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.899
Hal, you got two days

03:09.272 --> 03:10.899
to gamble.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.234
Why don't you take the boys

03:10.941 --> 03:13.234
to the pool bef...?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.862
Hal?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.240
They don't do anything.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.408
They're just there.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.953
Hold it there, boys.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.953
No one under 16

03:22.995 --> 03:24.496
allowed in the pool

03:22.995 --> 03:24.496
without an adult.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
It's okay.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
They're with me.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.542
Sorry.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.542
No parent, no pool.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.960
But that's ridiculous!

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
We all know how to swim.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.338
Okay, fine.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.882
We'll just go get my dad

03:33.380 --> 03:34.882
in the casino.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.551
Sorry. No kids allowed

03:34.923 --> 03:37.551
in the casino either.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.761
I'm not going to gamble.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.761
I just want to get my dad.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.471
Look, I don't make the rules.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.348
You're just doing this

03:41.513 --> 03:43.348
because you hate kids.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.267
I'm really not.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.267
It's just a happy coincidence.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.146
Mom, they won't let us

03:46.309 --> 03:49.146
in the pool without an adult.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.313
What are we

03:49.188 --> 03:50.313
supposed to do?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.566
LOIS: I don't know.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.566
Use your imaginations.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.359
What? We're on vacation.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.277
LOIS: Hey, there's dirt

03:54.401 --> 03:56.277
out there, isn't there?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.197
And rocks and lizards.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.365
And I think I saw

03:58.238 --> 04:00.365
an old tire in the parking lot.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.783
There are kids in the world

04:01.825 --> 04:04.203
with a lot less

04:01.825 --> 04:04.203
than an old tire to play with,

04:04.244 --> 04:07.288
so I don't want to hear

04:04.244 --> 04:07.288
another word about it!

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
Yeah, it's great being home.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.585
So catch me up. What's going on?

04:11.626 --> 04:14.171
Well, we had Salisbury steak

04:11.626 --> 04:14.171
for dinner.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.797
Yeah? With creamed spinach?

04:15.839 --> 04:16.590
Uh-huh.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.217
That's a great side dish.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.384
Now, I know they use celery salt

04:19.426 --> 04:20.928
and vinegar with that,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.346
but is that oregano I taste,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.346
or is that tarragon?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.306
Francis, I... I got to go.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.391
All right, fine. Put Finley on.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.976
You already talked to him twice.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.937
Come on, we're playing pool

04:28.018 --> 04:29.937
and I'm up.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
Okay, okay,

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
play your stupid game.

04:31.855 --> 04:35.025
I got some serious partying

04:31.855 --> 04:35.025
to do here anyway.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.659
Whoo!

04:48.622 --> 04:49.998
Yes! I win again!

04:50.040 --> 04:52.960
No fair. My goalie

04:50.040 --> 04:52.960
doesn't have any legs.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.335
Hey, boys.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.629
Hey, Dad.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.629
How'd you do?

04:55.670 --> 04:58.339
Well, you know,

04:55.670 --> 04:58.339
blackjack's a complicated game.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.008
You have your ups

04:58.381 --> 05:00.008
and your downs.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.803
So, who wants

05:00.050 --> 05:02.803
to buy me a Coke?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.345
It's too bad

05:02.844 --> 05:04.345
you had to quit, Dad.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.346
That shoe is full of tens.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.347
Huh?

05:06.389 --> 05:08.100
Tens. Face cards.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.018
Okay, there's six decks.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.853
They already

05:10.060 --> 05:11.853
played out 18 nines,

05:11.895 --> 05:14.355
14 eights, 12 sevens,

05:11.895 --> 05:14.355
but only two tens--

05:14.397 --> 05:15.941
a king of spades

05:14.397 --> 05:15.941
and a queen of diamonds.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.194
Which leaves...

05:15.983 --> 05:19.194
well, you can do the math.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.656
No, but you can,

05:19.236 --> 05:22.656
and that's all that matters!

05:22.697 --> 05:25.366
Oh, my little genius!

05:25.408 --> 05:27.786
♪ ♪

05:58.650 --> 05:59.860
Of course we're terribly sorry

05:58.650 --> 05:59.860
about this.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.402
You have to believe

05:59.901 --> 06:01.402
that this is

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
a momentary

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
lack of judgment

06:03.446 --> 06:04.489
on my part.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.242
See, I-I realize now

06:04.531 --> 06:07.242
that using my son...

06:07.284 --> 06:10.329
Your underage son.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.413
Yeah, my-my underage son, uh...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.708
to count cards was wrong.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.044
I guess I was just trying

06:14.749 --> 06:17.044
to look for an activity

06:17.085 --> 06:19.254
that the two of us

06:17.085 --> 06:19.254
can enjoy doing together.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.714
You know, it's a tough age.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.218
Yeah, a-and this was really

06:20.755 --> 06:24.218
helping my self-esteem.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.636
You see, I'm not

06:24.259 --> 06:26.636
really good at sports,

06:26.678 --> 06:29.514
and this made me

06:26.678 --> 06:29.514
feel... special.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.309
My son and I cook.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.810
Huh. That's a good thought.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.436
We'll have to try that.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.480
In the meantime,

06:37.522 --> 06:39.440
you're banned from the casino.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.942
Banned?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.444
Oh, no, no, no,

06:40.984 --> 06:43.444
you don't want to do that.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.905
You see, that...

06:43.486 --> 06:44.905
that's just not

06:44.946 --> 06:46.740
going to go over

06:44.946 --> 06:46.740
so well with my wife.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.034
And believe me, you don't

06:46.781 --> 06:49.034
want to see her angry.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.953
I'm not banning her.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.953
Just you.

06:51.995 --> 06:57.376
Okay, uh, look,

06:51.995 --> 06:57.376
let's just, uh...

06:57.416 --> 07:01.380
forget about the three grand

06:57.416 --> 07:01.380
that I... I won, hmm?

07:01.420 --> 07:05.300
Just pretend

07:01.420 --> 07:05.300
it never happened?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.634
Capisce?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.221
That's very generous of you.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.392
You're still banned.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.476
What?!

07:15.518 --> 07:16.895
Oh, all right, then.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.106
Just give me

07:16.937 --> 07:19.106
my money back.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.357
I'm sorry.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.482
What money?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.027
Hey, look, pal...

07:28.949 --> 07:32.077
Who said anything

07:28.949 --> 07:32.077
about money?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.828
Thank you.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.294
I tell you, I am not that

07:38.458 --> 07:40.294
impressed with this place.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.544
You call that

07:40.335 --> 07:41.544
a breakfast buffet?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.754
Not a tangelo to be found.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.423
What are you

07:42.796 --> 07:44.423
talking about?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.507
Didn't you see that teepee

07:44.464 --> 07:46.507
made entirely of sausage?

07:46.549 --> 07:47.592
It was incredible!

07:47.634 --> 07:49.594
I am going to die.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.596
Why didn't anyone stop me?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.098
In our family,

07:51.638 --> 07:53.098
we take the phrase

07:53.140 --> 07:55.016
"all you can eat"

07:53.140 --> 07:55.016
as a personal challenge.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.601
I know what'll

07:55.058 --> 07:56.601
cheer you up.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.561
Why don't we go gamble a little?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.314
Ooh, uh, now?

08:00.355 --> 08:02.399
Where does it say

08:00.355 --> 08:02.399
that just because

08:02.441 --> 08:04.401
you're at a casino

08:02.441 --> 08:04.401
you have to gamble?

08:04.443 --> 08:07.528
I mean, I-I'd rather spend some

08:04.443 --> 08:07.528
more time with my boys, huh?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.114
(laughing)

08:09.156 --> 08:11.450
Whoa, stop it, Dad.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.450
Please stop.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.534
Hal, you made me sit

08:11.491 --> 08:13.534
for eight hours in that car,

08:13.576 --> 08:15.703
listening to your foolproof

08:13.576 --> 08:15.703
system for winning at keno.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.622
Now you're telling me

08:15.745 --> 08:17.622
you don't want to gamble?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.041
We are surrounded

08:17.664 --> 08:20.041
by the great outdoors, Lois.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.543
I was thinking we might

08:20.083 --> 08:22.543
all go for a hike.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.380
(wind whistling)

08:27.507 --> 08:29.426
Okay, what have you done?

08:29.468 --> 08:31.052
What do you mean?

08:31.094 --> 08:32.595
Why are you avoiding

08:31.094 --> 08:32.595
the casino?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
Well, sweetheart,

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
we could sit here

08:34.264 --> 08:35.932
and I could tell you

08:34.264 --> 08:35.932
all about it

08:35.974 --> 08:38.059
and you might find

08:35.974 --> 08:38.059
it all very amusing,

08:38.101 --> 08:39.769
or you could think

08:38.101 --> 08:39.769
about the fact

08:39.811 --> 08:42.605
that I'm offering

08:39.811 --> 08:42.605
to take the boys off your hands

08:42.647 --> 08:44.524
for the whole day.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.029
Don't forget the sunblock.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.573
(sighs)

08:52.615 --> 08:54.575
All right, crew.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.661
I just happened to find

08:54.617 --> 08:56.661
a brochure in the lobby

08:56.703 --> 08:59.873
for the old

08:56.703 --> 08:59.873
El Diablo Ghost Town

08:59.914 --> 09:01.666
just a five-mile hike

08:59.914 --> 09:01.666
from here.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.876
What's a ghost town?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.211
What do you think it is?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.837
It's a town full

09:04.252 --> 09:05.837
of dead people.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.588
Why can't we just go swimming?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.799
Ah, we can swim at home.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.799
Where?

09:09.841 --> 09:11.592
Come on, it'll be fun.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.347
Look, they have a real working

09:11.634 --> 09:15.347
old-timey ice cream parlor.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.725
We're going!

09:39.538 --> 09:41.748
♪ ♪

10:08.775 --> 10:10.860
(sniffing)

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
(both scream)

10:33.716 --> 10:34.968
BOTH:

10:33.716 --> 10:34.968
What are you doing here?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.677
Shouldn't you be

10:35.009 --> 10:36.677
in military school?

10:36.719 --> 10:38.888
Shouldn't you not be

10:36.719 --> 10:38.888
in my father's robe?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.682
That is neither here nor there.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.561
You are in big trouble,

10:41.724 --> 10:44.561
my friend.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.686
I'm  in trouble?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.356
Yes, big trouble.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.359
I'm telling your mother.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.905
No...  I'm  telling

10:51.401 --> 10:55.905
my mother!

11:04.789 --> 11:07.000
That's my toast.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.419
We'll split it.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.422
HAL:

11:10.753 --> 11:12.422
Huh. I don't get it.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.716
The map says the ghost towns

11:12.464 --> 11:15.716
are only a half-inch away.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.218
Dad, we're lost.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.886
What sounds more idiotic:

11:18.928 --> 11:22.807
"Let's go to the desert, kids"

11:18.928 --> 11:22.807
or "Good idea, Dad"?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.725
Hi, Mom!

11:24.767 --> 11:26.144
Dewey, what are you

11:24.767 --> 11:26.144
doing here?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.104
I thought you went for a hike

11:26.186 --> 11:28.104
with your father.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.772
I couldn't.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.772
I don't like ghosts.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.898
They eat little boys.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.983
That's ridiculous.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.734
There's no such thing as ghosts.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.112
Except for that one that'll get

11:33.776 --> 11:36.112
you if you go up on the roof.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.365
Come on, you're too young

11:36.154 --> 11:38.365
to be in a casino.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.992
MAN: Come on, folks,

11:38.406 --> 11:40.992
take a spin at the wheel.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.371
Oh, may as well

11:41.034 --> 11:44.371
try my free spin.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.747
That's right, lady.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.747
Nobody goes home a loser.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.042
MAN:

11:46.789 --> 11:49.042
Oh, God, I'm ruined!

11:49.083 --> 11:52.170
Okay, let's give

11:49.083 --> 11:52.170
it a whirl.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.760
(gasps)

11:59.802 --> 12:01.262
Well, look at that.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.057
You have won our Champagne

12:01.304 --> 12:04.057
Dreams Package for two.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.975
An entire day of his

12:04.098 --> 12:05.975
and her spa treatments

12:06.017 --> 12:08.186
followed by an evening

12:06.017 --> 12:08.186
of dinner and dancing.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.063
Well, that's just perfect.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.856
My husband's out on a hike,

12:10.104 --> 12:11.856
and we're leaving tomorrow.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.858
Relax, lady. It's

12:11.898 --> 12:13.858
good for six months.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.818
Six months?!

12:15.860 --> 12:17.778
I had to work

12:15.860 --> 12:17.778
six months of overtime

12:17.820 --> 12:20.073
in a crummy drugstore

12:17.820 --> 12:20.073
just to pay for this trip.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.659
Have you ever had to recommend

12:20.114 --> 12:22.659
hemorrhoid cream

12:22.701 --> 12:23.784
to a complete stranger?

12:23.826 --> 12:26.287
Do you want the

12:23.826 --> 12:26.287
prize, or not?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.963
You carry a lot of tension

12:33.211 --> 12:35.963
in your shoulders.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.049
Tell me about it.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.593
All right, now, listen.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.593
Come on.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.720
Let's just all get

12:39.634 --> 12:41.720
our bearings here, shall we?

12:41.760 --> 12:42.803
All right, here's the sun.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.804
What's it telling us?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.014
That it's hot.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.808
Hey, is that a

12:45.056 --> 12:47.808
fence over there?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.102
By God, you're right!

12:49.143 --> 12:50.811
See, I told you we weren't lost.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.439
Then where are we?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.814
By the fence.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
It's a sure sign

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
of civilization.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.693
I say we go in.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.487
Come on, come on.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.823
Wait a minute.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.534
What if we're already in,

13:04.576 --> 13:07.078
and instead of going in,

13:04.576 --> 13:07.078
we're actually going out?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.081
Son, sometimes the genius thing

13:07.120 --> 13:10.081
gets a little annoying.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.376
Come on. Let's just keep

13:10.123 --> 13:13.376
thinking positive thoughts.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.130
(plane flying overhead)

13:17.171 --> 13:18.923
Listen to that.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.634
That's a plane.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.636
There. Help! Help!

13:22.677 --> 13:24.763
Here, we need help!

13:24.803 --> 13:25.930
Oh, we're lost!

13:25.972 --> 13:30.184
Oh, for the love of God,

13:25.972 --> 13:30.184
help us!

13:33.896 --> 13:36.608
Well, shall we?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.160
FRANCIS:

13:45.366 --> 13:47.160
I can't believe this.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.911
I buy my own

13:47.201 --> 13:48.911
bus ticket home,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.955
I have to spend the

13:48.953 --> 13:50.955
whole weekend with you.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.457
I hear you.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.334
It's a shame you had to spend

13:52.499 --> 13:54.334
your own money.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.127
I've discovered a way

13:54.375 --> 13:56.127
you can travel for free

13:56.169 --> 13:57.712
through the Internet.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.256
What, you hack into

13:57.754 --> 14:00.256
an airline's reservation system?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.591
No, that's illegal.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.884
I go into a chat room

14:01.633 --> 14:03.884
and pretend to be

14:03.926 --> 14:05.804
a really hot

14:03.926 --> 14:05.804
18-year-old girl.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.388
I'm Debbie.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.517
I'm blond, naive,

14:07.430 --> 14:10.517
and I love to wear sundresses.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.102
Right now, I'm having

14:10.558 --> 14:13.102
a lot of problems at home.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.522
Dad's so mean.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.816
I'm going through

14:15.563 --> 14:17.816
all these changes,

14:17.856 --> 14:20.067
all these strange new feelings,

14:17.856 --> 14:20.067
he just doesn't understand...

14:20.109 --> 14:21.611
Wait, Craig.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.779
The free travel?

14:22.821 --> 14:23.904
Right.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.406
Debbie goes into

14:23.946 --> 14:25.406
some chat room,

14:25.448 --> 14:27.408
gets real friendly

14:25.448 --> 14:27.408
with some lonely guy,

14:27.450 --> 14:30.370
and before long

14:27.450 --> 14:30.370
he's willing to pay for a visit.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.622
Right now, I'm sitting on

14:30.411 --> 14:32.622
a ticket to Tampa.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.082
Oh, and I make sure he buys

14:32.664 --> 14:35.082
Debbie full fare coach,

14:35.124 --> 14:36.710
no restrictions.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.462
She may look good in a thong,

14:36.751 --> 14:39.462
but she's no dummy.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.424
Sweet.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.843
I'm thirsty.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.427
Yeah, well, we'd have

14:44.884 --> 14:46.427
water if some idiot

14:46.469 --> 14:48.763
hadn't used it to write

14:46.469 --> 14:48.763
an S.O.S. in the sand.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.015
Oh, I see. You people let me

14:48.805 --> 14:51.015
carry the water,

14:51.057 --> 14:52.933
and all of a sudden

14:51.057 --> 14:52.933
I'm the idiot?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.143
Malcolm, Reese, relax.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.936
We have nothing

14:54.185 --> 14:55.936
to worry about.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.647
Everything's

14:55.978 --> 14:57.647
going to be fine.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.983
Now, I want you to know that

14:57.689 --> 15:00.983
I love you boys very much.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.653
He keeps saying that.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.112
Oh, great.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.947
Now I'm hallucinating.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.947
I see a cougar.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.949
Don't be stupid.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.702
That's a puma.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.702
(gasps)

15:12.036 --> 15:13.872
(all screaming)

15:17.792 --> 15:19.711
(all screaming)

15:27.719 --> 15:28.762
(all yelling)

15:28.803 --> 15:29.970
Okay, everybody okay?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.848
Yeah, I guess so.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.266
Oh, my God.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.266
Where's Dewey?

15:33.307 --> 15:35.894
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.061
He's back at the hotel.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.479
Okay, then.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.440
Nobody's hurt,

15:38.521 --> 15:40.440
everything's fine.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.400
Dad, a cougar just blew up.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.984
I meant besides that.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.278
That's not good.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.488
Cougars don't just blow up.

15:47.530 --> 15:51.826
As near as I can figure,

15:47.530 --> 15:51.826
I did it with my mind.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.703
Reese, that's insane!

15:53.745 --> 15:56.080
I wouldn't talk to me

15:53.745 --> 15:56.080
like that if I were you.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.291
Okay, there must be

15:56.122 --> 15:58.291
some explanation.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.459
Okay, it could have been caused

15:59.500 --> 16:01.294
by a blasting cap

15:59.500 --> 16:01.294
left by a miner,

16:01.335 --> 16:03.296
although the explosion

16:01.335 --> 16:03.296
was much too big.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.840
Perhaps the cougar

16:03.337 --> 16:05.840
ate some dynamite.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.008
That's ridiculous.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
Maybe it's just a mirage.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.178
Could have been a mirage,

16:09.719 --> 16:11.178
although a mirage

16:11.220 --> 16:13.473
usually doesn't end up

16:11.220 --> 16:13.473
all over your shoes,

16:13.514 --> 16:15.391
which leads me back

16:13.514 --> 16:15.391
to the Reese thing.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.436
I accept your apology.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.939
Oh, this feels so good.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.107
I mean, you read about

16:20.980 --> 16:23.107
celebrities going to spas

16:23.149 --> 16:24.692
and having these

16:23.149 --> 16:24.692
kinds of treatments,

16:24.734 --> 16:27.695
but you marry young, you

16:24.734 --> 16:27.695
start spitting out kids,

16:27.737 --> 16:31.115
you can kiss this kind

16:27.737 --> 16:31.115
of thing good-bye.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.033
Don't eat the cucumber

16:31.157 --> 16:33.033
slices, honey.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.035
Okay.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.122
M-Z-R-Y-C.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.124
Nice try.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.124
What's that supposed to mean?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.126
"Mzryc"-- it's another

16:40.166 --> 16:42.126
military term.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.337
You know, the helmets

16:42.168 --> 16:44.337
that horses wear.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.130
Oh, right, right, right.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.465
This is nice.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.550
Hanging out on a Saturday,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.550
playing Scrabble.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.135
Couple of guys, relaxing.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.887
So, your folks

16:51.177 --> 16:52.887
getting along okay?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.054
What?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.054
Nothing.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.055
Here we go.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.766
Read it and weep.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.100
C-A-T.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.520
Hey, that's two "cats"

16:58.142 --> 17:00.520
for you, that's great.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.772
Just playing the tiles

17:00.561 --> 17:02.772
I'm dealt.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.774
So, uh, you pick up

17:02.814 --> 17:04.774
any bad vibes

17:04.816 --> 17:07.944
here on the home front,

17:04.816 --> 17:07.944
you let me know, right?

17:07.986 --> 17:08.903
Why?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.279
Hey! Take it easy, cowboy.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.990
Just making small talk.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.073
Okay.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.492
I guess they're doing fine.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.577
She's a strong little lady,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.577
that mother of yours.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.245
Sure, we have

17:16.619 --> 17:18.245
our moments at work,

17:18.287 --> 17:20.456
but you can't stay mad

17:18.287 --> 17:20.456
at that woman for long.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.124
You don't have

17:20.498 --> 17:22.124
to live with her.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.084
Maybe you just

17:22.166 --> 17:24.084
don't understand her.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.085
What's to understand?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.087
She's a total control freak.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.090
Maybe she doesn't get the

17:27.129 --> 17:30.090
support she needs here at home.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.594
Well, I wouldn't know, since

17:30.132 --> 17:33.594
she sent me to military school.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.096
Because you're a spoiled brat!

17:36.138 --> 17:39.392
And I'm pretty sure

17:36.138 --> 17:39.392
"Mzyrc" ends in a "K"!

17:39.433 --> 17:42.144
Look, it's a house!

17:42.186 --> 17:44.731
Yes!

17:42.186 --> 17:44.731
All right!

17:44.772 --> 17:45.899
(laughs)

17:45.940 --> 17:47.400
Come on.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.111
Hello! Hello!

17:51.153 --> 17:52.613
They're sitting

17:51.153 --> 17:52.613
at the table.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.323
They're just ignoring us.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.035
They probably think we're trying

17:54.365 --> 17:57.035
to sell them something.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.118
Hey, we're lost!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.328
A cougar exploded!

17:59.370 --> 18:01.039
Can we use your phone?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.707
Sorry, we hate to barge in,

18:02.749 --> 18:05.793
but this is

18:02.749 --> 18:05.793
kind of an emergency...

18:08.629 --> 18:11.090
Well, this is a little weird.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.803
Okay, I just figured this out.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.137
Run!

18:17.179 --> 18:19.265
(all screaming)

18:22.685 --> 18:26.064
We're on

18:22.685 --> 18:26.064
an artillery range!

18:26.105 --> 18:28.024
That's why

18:26.105 --> 18:28.024
the cougar blew up!

18:28.066 --> 18:29.233
It was hit by a shell!

18:29.275 --> 18:31.110
Are you sure?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.661
Pretty sure.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.712
Wait!

18:50.212 --> 18:51.297
(screams)

19:00.056 --> 19:02.141
(all screaming)

19:08.815 --> 19:09.899
(screams)

19:24.163 --> 19:25.873
No! Oh!

19:25.915 --> 19:28.501
Out, out, out, out,

19:25.915 --> 19:28.501
out, out, out, out!

19:40.262 --> 19:42.222
(screaming)

19:42.264 --> 19:43.307
Go, go, go, go!

19:43.349 --> 19:45.518
Of course, we're

19:43.349 --> 19:45.518
terribly sorry about this,

19:45.559 --> 19:48.146
and we realize that fences

19:45.559 --> 19:48.146
are there for a reason.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.272
However, in fairness,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.272
when we climbed the fence,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.316
we weren't sure

19:50.314 --> 19:52.316
if we were going in or out.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.110
You want to explain

19:52.358 --> 19:54.110
the theory, son?

19:54.152 --> 19:55.235
Not really.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.237
This is a highly

19:55.277 --> 19:57.237
classified testing ground,

19:57.279 --> 20:00.491
and I could very easily detain

19:57.279 --> 20:00.491
the three of you, indefinitely,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.242
for national security reasons.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.828
Know what nobody's

20:02.284 --> 20:03.828
mentioned?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.455
Is that this is supposed to be

20:03.870 --> 20:06.455
the greatest army in the world,

20:06.497 --> 20:08.624
and you couldn't even kill

20:06.497 --> 20:08.624
the three of us.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.752
I've got to tell you,

20:08.666 --> 20:11.752
I'm not impressed.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.255
Well, the great thing

20:12.712 --> 20:15.255
about this trip is

20:15.297 --> 20:18.258
the next time I hear we can't

20:15.297 --> 20:18.258
afford to go on vacation,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.553
I think I'll be

20:18.300 --> 20:20.553
okay with it.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.971
I trust everything went well

20:22.013 --> 20:24.264
for you and your handsome

20:22.013 --> 20:24.264
gentleman friend?

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
He is handsome,

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
isn't he?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.268
Can I have some ice cream?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.478
You can have

20:28.310 --> 20:29.478
anything you want.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.981
Tonight is our

20:29.520 --> 20:31.981
special night.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.150
(phone ringing)

20:36.318 --> 20:37.444
Hello?

20:37.486 --> 20:38.529
HAL:

20:37.486 --> 20:38.529
Dewey?

20:38.571 --> 20:39.989
Oh, thank God.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.532
Look, I only get

20:40.031 --> 20:41.532
to make one call,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.160
so put your mother on

20:41.574 --> 20:44.160
so she can come get us.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
Who was that?

20:49.331 --> 20:50.875
Wrong number.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.376
WOMAN (over P.A.):

20:50.917 --> 20:52.376
Announcing the arrival of

20:52.418 --> 20:56.255
Air Alabama Flight 63

20:52.418 --> 20:56.255
at Gate 11.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.635
Thank you.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.390
My foot is killing me.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.768
Ah, let's be

21:06.432 --> 21:08.768
brave soldiers, boys.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.354
Might get there after dark,

21:08.809 --> 21:12.354
but we've got plenty of water,

21:12.396 --> 21:14.356
and we'll be okay.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.234
Tell us the story again,

21:14.398 --> 21:16.234
Dad, please?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.735
Yeah, yeah.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.029
All right, one last time.

21:20.071 --> 21:24.242
Dewey is tied to a post

21:20.071 --> 21:24.242
in the burning sun.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.535
He's covered entirely in honey.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.954
Even his eyes?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.538
Even his eyes.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.999
Uh-oh, what's that behind him?

21:32.041 --> 21:36.587
A million fire ants,

21:32.041 --> 21:36.587
hungry fire ants

21:36.629 --> 21:39.673
with sharp little mandibles

21:36.629 --> 21:39.673
and itchy feet.
