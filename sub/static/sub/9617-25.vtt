♪♪

00:13.881 --> 00:15.180
How long we avoidin' this?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.215
Not avoidin' nothin'.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.783
Just life moving on
beyond that thing

00:17.785 --> 00:19.385
That happened
between me and lucas.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.986
Hm.
(smacks lips)

00:20.988 --> 00:22.287
I know what it was.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.455
You don't have to
fish-face at me.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.391
-(smacks lips)
-there wasn't a kiss!

00:25.393 --> 00:26.625
There wasn't?

00:26.627 --> 00:29.128
-No.
-What was there?

00:29.130 --> 00:31.363
He just grabbed my head

00:31.365 --> 00:33.232
And stared
at my face real close.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.304
Y-- yeah.
Just like that. Yeah.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.841
-That's a good move.
-I didn't hate it.

00:42.843 --> 00:43.876
Let's discuss!

00:43.878 --> 00:45.344
Let's not.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.212
Other things are happening.
Life has gotten over this.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.814
If you pour ketchup
on that mac and cheese,

00:48.816 --> 00:51.150
(shudders)
I will never forgive you.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.254
-Life isn't over it, maya.
-(dry heaves)

00:55.256 --> 00:57.556
He held your face,
you went on dates,

00:57.558 --> 01:00.025
You poured a smoothie
over his head...

01:00.027 --> 01:01.226
That's a good move.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.661
I didn't hate it.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.996
But now,
what are you guys?

01:03.998 --> 01:06.165
Life wants to know, maya.
Life wants to know right now.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.599
-No, it doesn't.
-It does.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.735
Look around.
Nothing's happening.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.241
Maya...

01:16.243 --> 01:19.244
Until we talk about...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.580
Nothing is ever happening again.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.587
Jane austen's
<i>sense and sensibility</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:31.423
Focused on the multiple loves
of two young women.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.691
Well, would you look at that?

01:33.627 --> 01:36.395
Miss austen felt there were
two approaches to love.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.930
"sense," meaning what?

01:37.932 --> 01:39.064
Good, intelligent judgment.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.532
And "sensibility"?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.468
When feeling is getting
in the way of that.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.403
So, what you think
you should feel

01:44.405 --> 01:46.438
Versus what you feel.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.408
You-- you know
what's a good book?

01:49.410 --> 01:51.477
<i>Hop on pop.</i>

01:51.479 --> 01:53.212
Come on, maya.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.946
What's not to love
about figuring out love?

01:54.949 --> 01:55.981
Help me.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.883
Mm-mm. No.
I'm out of this.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.284
I'm just gonna sit back

01:59.286 --> 02:01.353
And enjoy whatever
happens for once.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.389
-Charlie gardner.
-Unbelievable.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.460
I saw the movie of this.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.162
Class:
Why?

02:11.499 --> 02:12.898
'cause I'm sensitive.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.333
Class:
Why?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.335
'cause I got a mother
and a bunch of sisters

02:16.337 --> 02:17.769
Who took over the tv
and sat on me

02:17.771 --> 02:19.304
Like a beanbag chair.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.907
Did you learn anything
from the movie, mr. Gardner?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.343
No...

02:26.347 --> 02:28.447
But I might've noticed
that in order for

02:28.449 --> 02:31.483
A relationship to work,
you need sense and sensibility.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.218
(yells)
why?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.487
Where was everybody?

02:37.158 --> 02:40.359
Oh, you noticed that, did ya?

02:40.361 --> 02:43.795
Miss austen teaches us that
romance comes with conflict.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.863
Two young women

02:44.865 --> 02:47.533
With different ideas
about what love is.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.302
One hid her true feelings
to protect others.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.004
She thought this made "sense".

02:52.006 --> 02:54.873
The other had more feelings
than she knew what to do with.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.442
She was overwhelmed
by "sensibility".

03:01.148 --> 03:03.148
What about the character
who knows all the secrets

03:03.150 --> 03:04.883
Of the character who's
hiding her true feelings?

03:04.885 --> 03:08.153
He's driven to madness
and dies alone and scared.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.223
-Thank you.
-Hm. Good.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.524
-Sneh.
-Fneh.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.861
What happens to
the two girls, harper?

03:15.863 --> 03:18.330
Oh, yeah, the two girls.

03:18.332 --> 03:21.366
Everything's always okay
between the two girls, right?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.968
No, maya.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.471
Love is never easy
and often comes at great cost.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.511
And the relationships
that seem the strongest

03:32.513 --> 03:35.113
Are the most
tragically torn apart.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.517
Y-- you know what's a book

03:38.519 --> 03:41.220
Where no one gets
tragically torn apart?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.561
You know how the girls
decide who they love?

Cinderelli!

(giggles)

05:00.134 --> 05:02.501
Apparently, these
sorts of things

05:02.503 --> 05:03.769
Get decided at the ball.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.904
You know what we need?
A ball.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.006
All I know is
I've been reading

05:08.008 --> 05:09.908
As long as you,
and I'm on page seven.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.513
(whispers) I don't think
this is in america.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.652
What is essential
to the situation,

05:20.654 --> 05:24.589
My dear maya,
is to host a ball.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.258
A grand ball.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.327
A new year's eve ball.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.596
We shall invite all
of the eligible gentlemen

05:31.598 --> 05:33.198
Of good breeding--

05:33.200 --> 05:35.567
-I hear you're having a party.
-How?

05:36.704 --> 05:37.936
Come on, charlie gardner.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.538
We'll get things
sorted out at the dance!

05:39.540 --> 05:41.440
-Ball!
-America!

05:41.442 --> 05:43.108
Oh. Well, am I included

05:43.110 --> 05:44.710
In the things who need
to be sorted out?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.512
Well, mr. Gardner...

05:47.514 --> 05:49.715
You are in excellent standing

05:49.717 --> 05:52.517
And... Well regarded
in the village.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.731
He never makes it easy,
does he?

06:07.401 --> 06:10.102
Speaking of tough decision...

06:12.339 --> 06:14.740
-Hi.
-Hey, huckleberry.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.575
So, uh, charlie gardner
just asked me

06:16.577 --> 06:18.610
If I was invited
to your party.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.248
I-- I told him that
I didn't know about any party,

06:23.250 --> 06:25.484
And he smiled
like a charlie gardner,

06:25.486 --> 06:30.722
Gave me this weird bow,
and walked away.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.057
I still like him.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.026
Well, of course
you're invited, lucas.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.763
Oh, thanks, but I don't want
to be some last-second invite.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.664
Well, I do.
I'm coming, right?

06:39.666 --> 06:41.199
Uh, everybody's coming.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.535
-I thought of the party,
like, two seconds ago.
-(door opens, closes)

06:43.537 --> 06:45.237
I don't know
how charlie does it.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.805
Heard you just
talkin' about me.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.610
What'll be interesting is...

06:51.612 --> 06:53.378
Who's with who at midnight.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.280
For why?

06:55.282 --> 06:57.682
For why would
that be interesting?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.951
Yeah, why would that
be interesting, riley?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.953
Hey, remember when
you did this?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.027
We had a deal.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.629
I gave you some time
to tell everybody the truth

07:10.631 --> 07:13.865
About how you really feel,
and you haven't done
anything about it yet.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.534
Guess how much time
you have left?

07:16.770 --> 07:19.204
Oh. This has something to do
with new year's, doesn't it?

07:20.707 --> 07:22.307
Tell them you still
like lucas, riley.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.742
Just tell them the truth.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.277
Don't start a new year
with a lie.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.881
Farkle, maya stepped back
for me when she saw
that I liked him.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.884
If-- if she has feelings
for him, how could I not
do the same for her?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.453
You don't know that.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.721
You don't know how she feels.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.824
I don't think she knows
how she feels.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.225
You know why?

07:40.227 --> 07:43.061
Because she can only read
seven pages in three hours.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.631
Because all these things
we're feeling are new.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.999
We don't know
what they are yet.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.169
Harper said this all
comes at a cost.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.737
What's your cost, riley?

07:52.739 --> 07:53.672
Your own happiness?

07:54.775 --> 07:57.776
Farkle, you said that
you wouldn't tell anybody.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.344
How could you do this to me?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.012
I'm doing it for you, riley.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.914
I care so much about you,
I want you to know that

08:02.916 --> 08:04.282
The truth is always
the best thing.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.750
How is it the best thing

08:05.752 --> 08:07.486
If it turns
everything into a mess?

08:07.488 --> 08:09.921
You don't think
this is a mess already?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.123
I want you to tell them.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.658
I know you would
have me do the same thing.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.661
You ever heard of
the horn of gabriel?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.863
No.

08:17.865 --> 08:18.663
He's an angel.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.265
They say when
he blows his horn,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.833
It's the end of time.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.270
If you don't tell everybody
how you really feel...

08:25.272 --> 08:26.872
His horn blows at midnight.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.441
(imitates horn)

08:30.811 --> 08:32.878
Just because I don't do much
doesn't mean I can't.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.992
Okay, everybody.
Riley's house.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.560
We're ringing in the new year.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.861
I'll be with smackle
at midnight.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.729
Who will you all be with?

09:03.343 --> 09:06.077
We form friendship
before even we know
what friendship means.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.114
We just know,
"hey, I like this person."

09:11.385 --> 09:13.752
It's nice we're all looking
at each other.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.256
We grow before we even know
what growth means.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.592
We just know,
"I see things differently now."

09:21.528 --> 09:23.762
And finally, we feel.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.830
And you know
what we know from feelings?

09:25.832 --> 09:27.198
Nothin'.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.867
We just feel.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.670
It's how we know we're alive.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.573
But you have to be
careful with feelings.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.442
They can tear apart
friendship and growth.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.377
Friends come first,

09:39.379 --> 09:42.414
And growth is knowing
that your friends' happiness
comes before your own.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.916
-That's nuts.
-You tell her, ham bone!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.186
But dad, you've always
lived that way.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.055
Not always, riley.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.256
I didn't used to.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.025
But I learned...

09:54.027 --> 09:55.660
The way you're learning now.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.730
Every event in history

09:58.732 --> 10:00.765
Comes from
people feeling something

10:00.767 --> 10:03.468
And then acting
on those feelings,

10:03.470 --> 10:06.972
Or sometimes being
smart enough not to.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.808
That's how you grow.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.476
Is that on the test, sir?

10:11.478 --> 10:12.777
It is.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.446
When is the test, sir?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.815
Every day.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.617
Happy new year, everyone.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.719
(school bell rings)

10:22.789 --> 10:24.889
Do you give in
to your feelings

10:24.891 --> 10:26.925
Or let your mind rule
over your heart?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.426
I follow my heart.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.928
It gets me into trouble.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.429
What about you, riley?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.465
My mind tells me
to do what's right.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.668
Can anyone answer which is
more valuable to follow?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.236
It depends on the situation.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.738
No, it doesn't.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.806
Just taking a shot!

10:42.909 --> 10:44.809
-Very passionate.
-Thank you!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.511
And that's where
we run into trouble.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.879
You set me up!

10:49.816 --> 10:52.817
The untamed heart
can be reckless

10:52.819 --> 10:55.620
And sometimes harmful
to yourself and to others.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.355
But pure intellect,

10:57.357 --> 11:00.959
Never following your heart,
is a life unlived.

11:00.961 --> 11:04.029
<i>Sense and sensibility.</i>

11:04.031 --> 11:06.164
What's the most important
word in the title?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.166
-"sense".
-"sensibility".

11:08.168 --> 11:09.534
Farkle?

11:09.536 --> 11:10.769
"and".

11:10.771 --> 11:12.437
Head "and" heart.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.105
You need to use both.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.109
Very good.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.012
You have until new year's eve.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.781
This horn blows at midnight.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.594
I ain't doin' it.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.164
Yeah, okay.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.066
Oh, riley.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.567
Take a look around.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.235
These are the people
of your life

11:44.237 --> 11:47.972
Last year, this year,
and for at least the next
four years of high school.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.307
Treat them right.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.077
Here's to the right decisions
for the right reasons.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.745
Happy new year, my daughter.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.880
Oh, I got it.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.949
-(doorbell)
-I got it.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.960
Hello, riley.
Happiest of new year's.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.797
-Oh.
-Tell me when
the pressure is sufficient.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.034
All you have to do
is mean it, smackle.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.069
One thing at a time!

12:18.071 --> 12:20.171
-Tick, tick, tick--
-okay! Yeah, yeah.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.907
Farkle, welcome to my party.
Have a great time.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.843
You know, riley,
as a spinster...

12:26.012 --> 12:29.047
You may not be aware,
but romance is very much
in play on new year's eve.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.548
-Is that right, dearest?
-Yes.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.517
I'm told who you're with
when the clock strikes 12:00

12:32.519 --> 12:34.119
Is how you'll spend
the coming year.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.121
I will certainly be with you.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.291
Unless my third wheel
tries to intervene.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.861
I'm not your
third wheel, smackle.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.362
I just arrived
at the same time.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.564
Desperation doesn't look good
on you, lucas,

12:46.566 --> 12:48.099
Even though
everything else does.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.137
-Smackle!
-Which part was I not
supposed to say out loud?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.205
You can say whatever you want.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.240
She's mine.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.775
Tell her that!

13:04.151 --> 13:05.250
Hi.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.551
Hi.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.724
Hi.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.494
Heard this is gonna be awkward.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.907
Mr. And mrs. Matthews.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.074
Charlie.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.843
Topanga, this is
charlie gardner.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.045
-Oh! Hi, charlie.
-Hi. I'm a good person.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.181
Okay.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.850
Uh, what are these? Games?

13:38.852 --> 13:39.918
Yeah, these are games.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.352
We got the family game,
the friends game,

13:41.354 --> 13:42.587
The couples game,
and twister.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.721
No twister.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.790
The couples game, please.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.492
I wouldn't.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.760
The couples game, please.

13:48.762 --> 13:49.994
I done what I can.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.167
Does it have to be
next year already?

13:56.169 --> 13:59.003
Actually, we've still got
an hour until it's next year.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.506
Let's recap
what we have thus far.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.675
You and me,
riley and auggie,

14:03.677 --> 14:05.877
All of these
friends and family,

14:05.879 --> 14:08.613
You and me,
no matter what happens.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.115
Next year,
bring it on.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.618
Happy new year, topanga.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.587
Happy new year, cory matthews.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.056
(chuckles)

14:21.661 --> 14:23.027
What do you got there, charlie?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.696
It's the couples game.
Wanna play?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.030
What is it?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.667
Shows if you'd be
a good couple or not.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.169
-Wanna play?
-Riley and lucas: No!

14:31.171 --> 14:32.470
What's wrong, lucas? Scared?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.205
No, I'm not scared
of anything. Let's go.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.207
Riley, think you might
find this interesting.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.142
-Would you like
to be my partner?
-Sure.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.645
-You and me?
-Sure.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.681
I like it better when
we're on the same team,

14:43.683 --> 14:44.749
My former nemesis.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.118
And now,
I go like this.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.725
Okay, first question is for us.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.294
"what is your partner's
favorite movie snack?"

14:57.530 --> 15:00.231
I know this.
It's popcorn and licorice.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.533
When something funny happens

15:02.535 --> 15:03.968
And she thinks
she's laughed too hard,

15:03.970 --> 15:06.104
She looks around the theater
to see if anybody heard her.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.239
And if she thinks something
scary is gonna happen,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.674
She reaches out
and grabs your arm.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.175
And she doesn't even
know she did.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.678
It's not your turn, friar!

15:13.680 --> 15:15.413
And that wasn't
the question, gardner!

15:15.415 --> 15:17.181
-What's her favorite snack?
-Gummies.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.183
-Yeah, but what--
-red.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.185
-Yeah, but what does she--
-she bites their heads off first
so they feel less pain.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.621
He's like a creepy
creep-creep!

15:24.758 --> 15:26.891
-Why are you interested?
-I'm not.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.693
Okay. You wanna pick
a card for us?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.628
Yeah.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.463
"how would you describe
your personality:

15:32.465 --> 15:34.265
Library or campfire?"

15:35.702 --> 15:37.368
Oh. Well, you know...

15:39.306 --> 15:42.240
Huckleberry,
it's just a game.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.976
"is it possible to love
two people at the same time?"

15:48.481 --> 15:50.448
Um. Yum!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.150
Our turn.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.321
"what is your partner's most
ticklish place on their body?"

15:56.323 --> 15:58.056
Uh, farkle and smackle...

15:58.058 --> 16:00.391
-How would they possibly...
-Know anything like that?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.293
(laughs oddly)

16:08.401 --> 16:10.668
Huh.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.071
Okay. Um...

16:13.073 --> 16:14.639
We'll do one more.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.744
"have you ever kept a secret
from somebody you love?"

16:19.746 --> 16:22.013
-Game over.
-Why? Because you know
secrets are dangerous?

16:22.015 --> 16:24.182
No, farkle.
Because it's almost midnight.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.351
-And you know
what happens at midnight.
-Okay, it's time to go up

16:26.353 --> 16:27.719
To the roof.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.425
I just happen to be
standing next to you.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.195
Who's the creepy
creep-creep now?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.478
Farkle!

16:53.480 --> 16:56.014
You dragged me all the way
up the stairs. I liked it.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.050
-I just need
a little more time.
-No more time!

16:59.052 --> 17:01.819
We made a deal, riley.
We're not starting off the new
year with lies between friends.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.855
I'm lying for my friend, farkle.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.024
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.159
I don't think she knows
what she's doing.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.293
Do you know?

17:11.197 --> 17:13.564
I'm sorry, riley.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.067
This is all new for me too.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.703
All I know is
that we should always
tell each other the truth.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.372
Farkle...

17:23.309 --> 17:25.343
If you really care about me...

17:25.345 --> 17:27.512
I know that you
will do the right thing.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.347
I do.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.415
And I will.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.350
(footsteps)

17:32.352 --> 17:34.419
Hi, farkle.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.320
Hi, girl who's not going to be
with farkle at midnight

17:36.322 --> 17:37.555
Because I am
because he's mine.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.830
Not much of a mess
at all really.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.498
Yeah. Good bunch of kids,

17:47.500 --> 17:50.601
Although they left behind
a whole human being.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.270
I'm a mess.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.838
Who's gonna clean me up?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.440
"what'samatter," honey?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.108
I'm a little confused.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.212
-You're right again,
aren't you, matthews?
-Yes, I am.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.447
About what?

18:02.449 --> 18:05.116
How easy it is
to get torn apart

18:05.118 --> 18:06.951
By feelings
you don't understand.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.352
It's gonna be
a tough year, isn't it?

18:08.354 --> 18:11.889
Oh, it doesn't get any easier.
That's why you have to

18:11.891 --> 18:14.025
Stick close to
the people you trust

18:14.027 --> 18:16.260
So they can put you
back together again.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.829
Yeah.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.364
They're all right here,
aren't they?

18:20.366 --> 18:22.266
Yeah.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.568
They all are.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.637
So, why don't you
go join them?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.477
Happy new year, maya.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.879
Happy new year.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.126
-(door closes)
-you and me.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.327
Next year...

18:49.329 --> 18:51.295
Bring it on.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.037
Riley...

19:01.274 --> 19:02.907
I think I've proven
that I care about you

19:02.909 --> 19:05.510
And that I've learned
a lot about you.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.479
I'd really like it if you were
standing with me at midnight.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.119
Everything you say
makes sense, charlie.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.188
Is that enough?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.890
No.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.460
It's not.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.362
You said it.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.030
You know it.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.535
A good relationship needs more.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.038
And you deserve more.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.109
I'm sorry.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.410
Don't be.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.680
See what the new year brings.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.875
This spot taken?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.010
I was saving it.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.579
For who?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.882
I don't know anymore.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.153
Hey, lucas?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.221
Yeah?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.457
Have I ever said
anything nice to you?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.126
No.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.097
Well...

20:34.334 --> 20:35.833
It's one minute to midnight,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.568
And I'm glad
you're standing here.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.173
Wow. That kind of makes up
for everything.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.581
Everybody's with someone, huh?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.083
Yeah.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.419
You know what?

20:55.421 --> 20:56.921
What?

20:56.923 --> 21:00.458
This is the first new years
I ever made it to midnight.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.860
-Congratulations.
-Celebrators: Ten...

21:02.862 --> 21:04.195
Nine...

21:04.197 --> 21:05.396
-Ready to count it down?
-Eight...

21:05.398 --> 21:06.564
-Yeah.
-Seven...

21:06.566 --> 21:07.865
-Six...
-Okay, in...

21:07.867 --> 21:08.933
Both:
Five...

21:08.935 --> 21:12.637
All:
Four... Three... Two...

21:12.639 --> 21:14.305
One!

21:14.307 --> 21:15.406
(cheering and whistling)

21:15.408 --> 21:16.540
Riley still loves lucas.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.643
(fireworks whistling)

21:18.645 --> 21:20.978
(fireworks exploding)

21:20.980 --> 21:23.547
(fireworks whistling, exploding)

21:32.659 --> 21:34.425
Happy new year.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.227
(party horn squeaks)

21:44.270 --> 21:46.170
Thank you for
a wonderful evening.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.548
I'm sorry, guys.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.519
I did the right thing.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.855
I hope you can forgive me.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.526
Happy new year.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.455
It's midnight.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.693
Here we are.
