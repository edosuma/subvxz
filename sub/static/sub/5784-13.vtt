00:02.035 --> 00:05.404
(theme music)

00:45.645 --> 00:47.579
(music and conversations)

00:52.085 --> 00:54.319
Thomas. Those
are for the guests.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.889
So what am I?
Well, it's my new business,

00:56.891 --> 00:59.191
so you are the help.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.993
They should be finished.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.365
Oh don't worry about it,
Margaret, everything

01:06.367 --> 01:09.268
will be fine, I'm sure.
Just lend a hand

01:09.270 --> 01:12.471
where it's needed. And keep
an eye on those milling about.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.374
I don't want
anything stolen.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.210
(old style car horn)
(gasping): Here they are!

01:20.113 --> 01:22.948
Hurry along Thomas. Hello!

01:22.950 --> 01:25.284
(to himself): Bloody woman.

01:25.286 --> 01:28.554
Hello Mrs. Cummersworth!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.689
Hello!
Hello!

01:30.691 --> 01:33.158
Everything is in order,
I assure you.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.761
Thank you.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.529
Just this way. We don't want
the groom to see you.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.265
Thank you.
Thomas Brackenreid.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.168
Samuel Birkett.
The bride's side I take it?

01:43.170 --> 01:46.138
Most definitely the bride.
Most definitely?

01:46.140 --> 01:49.274
The groom's a pompous windbag.
Always rapping that cane

01:49.276 --> 01:52.177
as if he were a sergeant.
Says he was injured in the war.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.613
I wager he's never
seen a battlefield.

01:54.615 --> 02:00.018
I was in Afghanistan.
Were you now?

02:00.020 --> 02:03.188
"Writing class to be
taught by renowned novelist.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.258
"Signed book by author to be
included in price of class.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.128
Bring writing sample."
What do you think, Henry?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.630
I suppose it would
depend on the teacher.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.999
I'm the teacher.
You think writing

02:14.001 --> 02:15.801
one book qualifies you
as a writing teacher?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.870
I do! Now, I've
signed 20 copies

02:17.872 --> 02:20.439
of <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs,</i>
<i>hopefully that will be enough.</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:22.307
I'd imagine so.
(baby cooing)

02:22.309 --> 02:24.309
Sir.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.311
Shouldn't he be
walking by now?

02:26.313 --> 02:29.481
(more cooing)

02:29.483 --> 02:31.750
I have no idea, sir.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.986
Perhaps he's slow.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.957
I mean I... wouldn't
worry about it, sir.

02:38.959 --> 02:42.628
My mother said I didn't walk
'til I was almost three.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.568
Will you love him, comfort
him, honour and keep him,

02:49.570 --> 02:52.638
in sickness and in health;
and, forsaking all others,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.807
be faithful unto him
as long as you both shall live?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.776
I will.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.745
Elizabeth Cummersworth
and Oliver Pym,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.681
having witnessed your vows
of love to one another,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.683
it is my joy
to present you

03:04.685 --> 03:08.787
to all gathered here
as man and wife.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.390
You may kiss the bride.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.963
(applause and sweet laughter)

03:20.300 --> 03:22.935
Ladies and Gentlemen--

03:22.937 --> 03:24.970
(electric charge,
cries and gasps)

03:28.274 --> 03:30.642
Please sir, stand aside.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.482
May be an idea to start
planning the funeral.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.794
His skin is pale,
and his eyes are cloudy

03:48.796 --> 03:51.730
with dilated pupils.
There are contusions

03:51.732 --> 03:54.633
on the palm of his hand.
And his hair is

03:54.635 --> 03:56.969
slightly singed.
I already told you, doctor,

03:56.971 --> 03:59.271
I was there. The poor
sod was electrocuted.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.774
The question is was it
accidental or deliberate?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.843
William. Where's Roland?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.879
Oh, I've left him
in excellent care.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.282
(mouth noise
and gentle laughter)

04:12.218 --> 04:14.219
Where are you
going, George?

04:14.221 --> 04:16.355
I'm off to meet my students.
Well...

04:16.357 --> 04:18.357
You're not gonna
leave me with...

04:18.359 --> 04:20.058
(baby cooing)
Try not to let him

04:20.060 --> 04:22.127
outsmart you, Higgins.

04:26.633 --> 04:30.035
(voices, conversations)

04:39.045 --> 04:41.113
My condolences.

04:41.115 --> 04:44.483
Why are you still here?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.451
I'm trying to determine
the exact cause

04:46.453 --> 04:49.888
of your husband's death.
That hardly matters
now, does it?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.090
Wouldn't you
want to know

04:52.092 --> 04:55.961
the reason why?
I know what I need to know.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.463
Are we almost
done here?

04:58.465 --> 05:00.198
I'm gonna need to have
everything cleared away

05:00.200 --> 05:02.100
as soon as possible.
(knocking)

05:02.102 --> 05:04.569
Mrs. Cummersworth--
It's Pym now.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.039
Oliver died after
the vows were taken.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.941
Mrs. Pym. May we
have a word?

05:09.943 --> 05:12.044
What would you like to know?
Is there anyone you can

05:12.046 --> 05:14.179
think of who might
want your husband dead?

05:14.181 --> 05:17.649
Not a soul.
Is everything all right?

05:17.651 --> 05:21.019
Quite.
And you are?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.855
Judith Baxter, a friend.
I was the lady-of-honour

05:23.857 --> 05:27.492
in the wedding party. They've
laid out some tea for us.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.594
Was there
anything else?

05:29.596 --> 05:31.997
We do have
more questions.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.965
Can they not wait?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.934
This woman is newly bereaved.

05:35.936 --> 05:40.072
Of course.
Then you'll excuse us.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.808
We'll need to return
the wedding gifts immediately.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.244
And of course we'll need
to make funeral arrangements.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.047
The grieving bride.
She doesn't seem terribly

05:49.049 --> 05:51.650
affected by her husband's death.
No, she does not.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.587
The groom

05:55.589 --> 05:58.623
then kisses the bride...
Figuratively!

05:58.625 --> 06:01.393
They both turn
and head down the steps.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.996
No, they didn't. The groom
called everyone to attention.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.935
These lights are powered
by this electrical wire

06:09.937 --> 06:12.738
which seems to
enter the alter

06:12.740 --> 06:15.340
up along this pillar.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.777
Now, there is a
significant puddle here.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.012
This planter appears
to be responsible,

06:21.014 --> 06:23.682
it's been over watered.
This one isn't.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.851
So the deceased was stood
in a puddle when he went

06:25.853 --> 06:28.754
to make his speech.
And the bride wasn't.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.356
But sir, have
a look at this.

06:31.358 --> 06:34.593
The wire has been stripped bare,
allowing it to make contact

06:34.595 --> 06:37.496
with the assembly
and electrifying it.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.998
So the groom
raised his cane,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.067
made contact with it,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.469
and his body
closed the circuit.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.505
If the bride or daughter
had anything to do with this,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.273
they likely would
have needed help.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.876
Why is that? You don't
think women are devious enough

06:50.878 --> 06:53.779
to murder?

06:56.416 --> 06:59.384
(voices)

07:01.454 --> 07:03.789
Ah!

07:05.725 --> 07:08.126
Are we going to get started?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.896
Yeah... Right. Um...

07:16.836 --> 07:19.004
We already
know your name!

07:19.006 --> 07:21.706
And we paid for a two
full hours of instruction.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.708
It's already
five past seven.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.577
So you will be going
to five past nine.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.413
Very well, um... Right.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.482
Why don't we begin
with you telling me

07:30.484 --> 07:33.185
a bit about-let's
start with each of you

07:33.187 --> 07:35.420
telling me a little bit
about yourselves and what

07:35.422 --> 07:39.090
you hope to achieve
from the class. You must be

07:39.092 --> 07:42.260
Eunice?
No flies on him.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.530
Thank you. I would
like to write my memoirs.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.667
My life has been full
of mystery and romance.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.305
Excellent!

07:53.307 --> 07:55.974
Excellent, Eunice.
That's very intriguing.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.977
Uh... You, sir... Howard?
Yes.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.279
I plan on writing

08:01.281 --> 08:04.182
cowboy stories and
selling them to the weeklies.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.918
I hope to make a living at it.
Excellent!

08:06.920 --> 08:09.654
Write what you know. I take it
you've spent time on a ranch?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.289
No.
Did you spend some time

08:11.291 --> 08:13.925
in Ancient Egypt?
No.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.594
Then why did you say:
"Write what you know"?

08:15.596 --> 08:18.196
Alright, that piece of
advice comes from none other

08:18.198 --> 08:21.099
than Mark Twain. A man
I have met personally.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.435
Well, bully for you!
Perhaps you could get HIM

08:23.437 --> 08:25.437
to teach the class.
(big exasperated sigh)

08:25.439 --> 08:28.573
(knocking)
I'm so,

08:28.575 --> 08:31.843
so very sorry
I'm late. I apologize.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.412
It's just it's been
tremendously exciting

08:34.414 --> 08:37.849
to be in Toronto for the
first time. The clothing stores,

08:37.851 --> 08:40.619
my word! I went out for one
little thing and 2 hours later,

08:40.621 --> 08:44.289
well, you can see the trouble
I've gotten myself into.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.558
No need to apologize,

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Miss. Where are you
coming from?

08:48.562 --> 08:50.896
I hail from Cavendish,
the most beautiful town

08:50.898 --> 08:54.432
in all of Prince Edward Island.
You've come a long way, then.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.835
I trust your purpose
wasn't solely

08:56.837 --> 08:59.371
to attend my writing class?
Indeed, it was not,

08:59.373 --> 09:01.873
but I thought this class might
do me some good while I'm here.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.310
I've had some success with
short stories and poetry,

09:05.312 --> 09:08.013
but I'm very keen
to crack the novel form.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.550
Very good, what's your name?

09:11.552 --> 09:13.351
Lucy Montgomery.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.154
But friends and family
call me Maud.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.292
(voices)

09:22.228 --> 09:24.529
Whose idea was it to run
the electrical lights

09:24.531 --> 09:27.032
around the altar?
The wedding planner's.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.367
The woman
wanted a spectacle.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.236
I guess she got it.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.272
Had you any previous
experience with such lights?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.608
A light is a light.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.210
And a wire is a wire.

09:39.212 --> 09:43.348
Unless that wire has
deliberately been stripped bare.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.450
"If" the wire
was damaged,

09:45.452 --> 09:49.087
it was the fools who built
and decorated that altar.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.424
We were exceedingly
careful. We always are.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.492
That's why we're
the best in the business.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.194
The electrician believes
you may have damaged

09:56.196 --> 09:58.296
the electrical wiring.
Well, he doesn't know

09:58.298 --> 10:00.332
what he's talking about.
We completed our work

10:00.334 --> 10:03.535
before the wiring was done.
I would not overwater

10:03.537 --> 10:06.471
the plants. That arrangement
was extremely sensitive.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.640
You couldn't
have made a mistake?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.942
Are you questioning
my professionalism?

10:10.944 --> 10:14.145
You took a keen interest in
Mr. Pym's metal cane.
I didn't know

10:14.147 --> 10:16.481
you were a copper.
I never offered.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.384
Did you know that
metal conducts electricity?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.353
No.
Are you sure about that?

10:21.355 --> 10:24.222
I don't know anything about
electricity. And if I was
going to kill him, I would

10:24.224 --> 10:27.158
have done it face to face.
Why?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
Because...

10:29.162 --> 10:32.330
Elizabeth deserves better.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.666
We might want
to consider something.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.736
What's that, sir?
Well, that it was
just an accident.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.639
None of that lot seem to have
the spark to electrocute a man.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.442
Perhaps.
Did you get that: "Spark"?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.746
Yes. Very good sir.
Gentlemen.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.281
How were your suspects?
Clean as a whistle.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.684
Take a look at this.
Can I hold him?

10:52.686 --> 10:54.619
Of course!
I was speaking to a woman

10:54.621 --> 10:57.322
at the Suffrage Association
about Elizabeth's wedding

10:57.324 --> 11:00.191
and her husband's demise.
And her response?

11:00.193 --> 11:03.028
"Oh, no, not again!"

11:16.308 --> 11:19.644
Five husbands?
Elizabeth, née Drabble.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.213
Married the first
time in 1884

11:22.215 --> 11:25.050
to Paul Durrell,
22 years of age.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.419
He died in a fall
off of a bridge.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.922
Number two: Lucas
Gibson in 1887.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.059
Died in a hunting accident.
Seven years later

11:34.061 --> 11:37.095
to one Thomas McEwan.
His charred remains

11:37.097 --> 11:39.764
were found in a fishing
lodge that burned down.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.434
Her most recent last name
came from Bernard Cummersworth

11:42.436 --> 11:44.436
in 1898. He died

11:44.438 --> 11:47.939
after a piano that was being
moved fell on top of him.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.008
And now, number
five, Oliver Pym,

11:50.010 --> 11:52.010
by electrocution.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.279
Elizabeth Pym
is either

11:54.281 --> 11:57.248
the unluckiest
woman in the world or
one very competent murderess.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.351
I'd wager the latter.
William, with your permission,

12:00.353 --> 12:03.254
I'd like to observe.
Of course!

12:03.256 --> 12:06.891
(baby cooing)
Sir, if you wouldn't mind...

12:06.893 --> 12:09.427
Thank you.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.430
(more cooing)

12:12.432 --> 12:14.866
Promise me you won't
grow up to be like those two.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.469
How about a thimble
full of scotch? Heh heh!

12:19.538 --> 12:23.108
I understand this isn't the
first husband you've lost.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.110
No, I've lost

12:25.112 --> 12:27.746
all four of my husbands
prior to Oliver.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.714
You have

12:29.716 --> 12:31.716
to admit that's
rather suspicious?

12:31.718 --> 12:34.686
On the face of it.

12:34.688 --> 12:37.555
The only common element
in all these deaths

12:37.557 --> 12:40.492
is you.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.861
I was nowhere near
any of my husbands

12:42.863 --> 12:45.029
when they died. Excepting,
of course, Oliver, whom,

12:45.031 --> 12:47.465
as you may know,
I was standing next to.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.934
In fact, had he reached out
to touch me at that moment,

12:49.936 --> 12:54.806
I'd likely be dead as well.
Nevertheless, Mrs. Pym,

12:54.808 --> 12:57.742
these deaths are
connected, and I believe

12:57.744 --> 13:01.112
you are involved in all of them.
Indeed, I am.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.849
They all made the
mistake of marrying me.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.886
And leaving you
their money.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.688
If you want to try to prove
that I had something to do

13:10.690 --> 13:14.726
with the deaths of
my husbands, be my guest.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.427
Now,

13:16.429 --> 13:19.531
I have many things
to take care of.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.467
Mrs. Pym, I'll be
needing your fingermarks

13:22.469 --> 13:25.103
before you leave
the station house.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.807
Do you have any objections?
Not a one.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.021
What in the blazes
do you think you're doing?!

13:43.023 --> 13:45.456
How dare you treat
a lady like this?!

13:45.458 --> 13:47.859
It's all right, Samuel.
I agreed to this.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.728
Please wait for me
outside, in the car.

13:55.534 --> 13:58.069
That should do, Mrs. Pym.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.438
Thank you for your cooperation.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.417
The woman is
absolutely fascinating!

14:12.419 --> 14:15.153
She makes no effort whatsoever

14:15.155 --> 14:18.223
to hide her lack of feeling
about five dead husbands.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.725
She puts me in mind
of that insect species

14:20.727 --> 14:22.927
where the female
consumes the male

14:22.929 --> 14:25.363
right when they're
in the middle--

14:25.365 --> 14:28.600
Procreating.
Yes! The female praying mantis

14:28.602 --> 14:30.869
is known to devour her
mate during the sex act,

14:30.871 --> 14:33.872
as is the widow spider.
That's the perfect name

14:33.874 --> 14:37.208
for her: the black
"preying" mantis.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.378
Only change the 'a'
in praying to an 'e'

14:40.380 --> 14:42.647
because she preys upon--
Thank you, George.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.449
I think we should focus

14:44.451 --> 14:47.118
on the husbands.
I'll look into the fire

14:47.120 --> 14:49.454
at the fishing lodge.
Sir, I'm quite intrigued

14:49.456 --> 14:52.390
by this falling piano.
First thing tomorrow, then.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.026
And perhaps the Inspector
will be able to find someone

14:55.028 --> 14:58.062
connected to the Hunt Club
where Mr. Gibson was killed.

14:58.064 --> 15:02.100
Julia, could you look at
the previous coroner's reports?

15:02.102 --> 15:04.869
Perhaps something
was overlooked.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.672
Of course!

15:10.943 --> 15:13.678
Anything else, George?
Sir, I was hoping

15:13.680 --> 15:15.513
you might be able to
advise me on a little problem

15:15.515 --> 15:17.415
I've encountered.
Of course.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.784
As you know, I've undertaken
to teach a writing class.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.287
Oh. Very good.
Well, the samples

15:22.289 --> 15:24.689
of the writing
I've received, sir, are...

15:24.691 --> 15:27.292
to put it
kindly... Uneven.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.727
And I'm not sure
how to give criticism

15:29.729 --> 15:31.763
without unduly hurting
somebody's feelings.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.765
Well, the best
advice I can give

15:33.767 --> 15:36.567
is to look for
their positive qualities

15:36.569 --> 15:39.037
and give those equal
weight to your criticisms.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.172
Sir,

15:41.174 --> 15:43.241
what if there are
no positive qualities?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.077
Suggest another occupation.
Sir?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.346
Why would one
waste valuable effort

15:48.348 --> 15:51.716
on a vocation for which
they have no facility?

15:51.718 --> 15:54.285
It was 1855 when
my husband died.

15:54.287 --> 15:58.222
I was not so sad. I did not
like him. I was pretty

15:58.224 --> 16:01.326
and I always liked a handsome
boy. He was not handsome.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.094
But my mother said
he was a good catch.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.830
So I married him.
But I never did like him...

16:07.833 --> 16:09.968
...very much.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.006
Uh...

16:15.008 --> 16:17.709
the honesty of it is...

16:17.711 --> 16:21.212
remarkable, admirable,
poetic even.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.582
I think perhaps the sentences
are a bit repetitive.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.085
Perhaps it's just your voice.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.721
But also, I think

16:29.723 --> 16:31.756
the content could be
more colourfully described.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.726
You don't like it!
I didn't say that.

16:34.728 --> 16:37.428
It's my life story.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.397
Well, perhaps
we need to consider

16:39.399 --> 16:41.065
that not every life story

16:41.067 --> 16:43.768
is worth telling.
(The lady gasps.)

16:46.372 --> 16:48.639
Well...
I didn't mean to suggest--

16:48.641 --> 16:50.942
...I never!
Oh, please--

16:50.944 --> 16:53.077
I never!!!
(George sighs.)

16:53.079 --> 16:56.314
Right, then, who's
going to read next?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.449
(A door slams nearby.)

16:58.451 --> 17:00.651
Where's Mr. Raymond?

17:00.653 --> 17:03.321
He withdrew.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.623
Then I suppose
I shall go next.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.828
Ahem!

17:10.830 --> 17:13.297
It was just
after sundown

17:13.299 --> 17:15.266
in the wild,
wild west.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.702
The man with
the black cowboy hat

17:17.704 --> 17:20.738
and the sharp silver spurs
got off his high horse.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.342
Doing evil was on his mind.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.211
He spat on the dusty ground.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.815
He went into the saloon
and ordered a whiskey.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.583
He pulled out his gun.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.720
"Is there anyone here
brave enough to fight me?"

17:35.722 --> 17:38.689
he asked the crowd of cowboys--
Oh, sweet mother of mercy,

17:38.691 --> 17:41.292
please, Mr. Howard,
stop! Just stop!

17:41.294 --> 17:44.362
Why are you wasting your time?
Nobody would publish that!

17:44.364 --> 17:47.065
How dare you, you little sod.
I'm sorry,

17:47.067 --> 17:50.234
but it's nothing more than
a... collection of clichés.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.970
There is not a single
original thought in there!

17:52.972 --> 17:55.039
I don't want to encourage
you to waste your time

17:55.041 --> 17:57.041
in a vocation for which
you have no facility.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.377
My writing's
as good as yours!

17:59.379 --> 18:01.546
I couldn't even get
through the first chapter

18:01.548 --> 18:04.482
of that daft thing
you call a novel!

18:04.484 --> 18:07.218
You're no teacher,

18:07.220 --> 18:09.587
you're a fraud!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.689
(George sighs.)

18:11.691 --> 18:15.426
Looks like it's
just the two of us.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.898
And what did you think of...
MY writing, Mr. Crabtree?

18:20.900 --> 18:25.036
Please, George.
George?

18:25.038 --> 18:27.038
I did think you had

18:27.040 --> 18:29.607
significantly more aptitude
than any of the others.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.176
But there were a few
things I would like to discuss.

18:32.178 --> 18:35.546
I didn't come here to be
coddled, but for honest opinion.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.448
That is what I'd like
to hear from you.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.418
Are you sure about that?
I am.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.554
Alright then. Well, seeing
as it's just the two of us,

18:43.556 --> 18:47.125
perhaps we could
find a more comfortable
venue for our discussion.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.761
I'd like that.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.264
(conversations, dishes)

18:53.266 --> 18:56.134
So... "George"?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.803
what did you
really think?

19:00.606 --> 19:02.440
There's no question
in my mind, Maud:

19:02.442 --> 19:05.076
you have a real gift.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.044
How kind of you.
Uh, I've read

19:07.046 --> 19:09.280
the first several chapters of
this novel you intend to write,

19:09.282 --> 19:12.316
this "Anne of Green Gables"...
Yes?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.352
...and I think
your style is very good.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.754
Excellent even.
I just wonder

19:16.756 --> 19:18.856
if Anne should be...

19:18.858 --> 19:21.192
born into a more
interesting family.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.861
I mean, they're all
rather dull, don't you think?

19:23.863 --> 19:26.430
You might be
right about that.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.933
I'll give it
some further thought.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.436
And you do tend go a bit
overboard with the nature stuff.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.006
I mean, nature
is terrific,

19:35.008 --> 19:38.743
but after a while,
how many trees and streams

19:38.745 --> 19:41.979
can a reader take?

19:41.981 --> 19:45.283
And it takes so long before
anything actually happens.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.685
And... when
it finally does,

19:47.687 --> 19:51.689
I find this Anne character's
misadventures are, uh...

19:51.691 --> 19:54.125
what's the word?
Um... uh...

19:54.127 --> 19:56.194
Trivial, uninteresting.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.629
And the red hair and
the freckles, that's all

19:58.631 --> 20:01.265
a bit overstated,
isn't it. Anne tends

20:01.267 --> 20:03.834
to go on and on and on,
about every little thing.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.604
I think you should
consider making Anne

20:06.606 --> 20:10.241
a boy. I mean, then she'd be
able to have real adventures.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.112
Can we go back
to the parts you liked?

20:17.316 --> 20:19.250
As I mentioned before,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.319
I think your use of
the English language is...

20:21.321 --> 20:23.955
exemplary.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.958
Since my language
skills... are exemplary,

20:26.960 --> 20:29.393
I'll make this
short and sweet.

20:29.395 --> 20:33.297
Goodbye, Mr. Crabtree.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.069
(chimes from the door)

20:46.645 --> 20:48.946
Lucas Gibson was with
the Crothers Woods Hunt Club.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.649
His shooting was
assumed to be an accident.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.451
Were they able to determine
which of the hunters' guns

20:53.453 --> 20:55.486
the bullet came from?
No.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.788
But the guide that took them out
that day was the only one

20:57.790 --> 20:59.857
unaccounted for when
the victim was shot.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.960
He vanished shortly afterwards.
George?

21:02.962 --> 21:05.296
Sir, I spoke to somebody
at the moving company.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.798
He said when the piano
fell and killed Cummersworth,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.834
one of the movers
that day was a new chap

21:09.836 --> 21:11.936
and right after
the incident, he disappeared.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.305
How did it fall on him?
Improperly strapped,

21:14.307 --> 21:16.340
apparently. It fell
a full five stories.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.909
Must've caused quite a mess.
Oh sir, the splatter reached

21:18.911 --> 21:21.445
a call box across the street--
Gentlemen...

21:21.447 --> 21:24.015
(baby cooing)
...please.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.450
Aah... Right Murdoch,

21:26.452 --> 21:28.786
what did you uncover?
Another missing man.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.322
When the lodge burned
down to the ground,

21:31.324 --> 21:33.958
an unknown man
alerted the Sheriff.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.160
He was also never seen again.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.429
So there was a
suspicious male present

21:38.431 --> 21:41.098
when each of these
supposed 'accidents' occurred.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.268
And all three times he
disappeared straight afterwards.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.405
What about the first husband?
Was there a missing man there?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.707
Dr. Ogden wasn't able
to find much detail

21:49.709 --> 21:52.376
in the coroner's report,
except that Mr. Paul Durrell

21:52.378 --> 21:54.578
died from a head
injury sustained

21:54.580 --> 21:57.114
from a fall off a bridge.
Any mention of a witness?

21:57.116 --> 21:59.817
Unfortunately no.
But it does seem likely

21:59.819 --> 22:02.353
that this disappearing man
could all be one and the same.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.289
And our killer.
This picture shows

22:05.291 --> 22:08.059
the six-man hunting party.

22:08.061 --> 22:10.494
There's the guide
that disappeared.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.264
Hard to tell what he looks like
now; it was fifteen years ago.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.812
We have met
this man before.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.880
The florist,
from the wedding.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.386
And the grieving
widow's accomplice.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.361
How do you account for the
fact that each of your husbands

22:43.363 --> 22:45.129
died after
they married you?

22:45.131 --> 22:47.898
How many is it
now? Five?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.468
It's my bad luck I suppose.
YOUR bad luck?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.636
They're the ones
who keep on dying.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.472
You're the one who
keeps on getting richer.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.842
Inspector, there's no need
for that kind of tone.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.777
And if you think you've got
such bad luck, why is it

22:59.779 --> 23:02.413
you keep on getting married?
That's my prerogative

23:02.415 --> 23:04.682
and really,
none of your business.

23:04.684 --> 23:08.085
What can you tell us
about Fergus Dexter?

23:08.087 --> 23:11.122
Who's he?
The florist at your wedding,

23:11.124 --> 23:13.290
the most recent one, that is.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.126
She's already told you
she doesn't know him.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.728
I neither hired
nor dealt directly

23:17.730 --> 23:21.098
with any of the workmen.
Talk to that idiotic
wedding planner.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.033
(Clears his throat.)

23:23.035 --> 23:25.302
Maybe you hired him
for a less savoury job.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.538
If you'll excuse me,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.807
I have a funeral
to get ready for.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.143
We're not finished
here, Mrs. Pym.

23:32.145 --> 23:35.646
I am, so charge me
or let me go.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.755
Well if she won't talk,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.124
perhaps the "florist" will.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.393
If he is still in town.

23:49.395 --> 23:53.130
Best talk to the
idiotic wedding planner.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.167
Miss Montgomery!

23:56.169 --> 23:59.904
Mr. Crabtree, could...
I have word?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.839
I was hoping
I would see you again.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.508
I really want to apologize.
As do I.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.444
No, no, no. I never should
have been so aggressive

24:06.446 --> 24:09.079
in my critique.
And I should not have asked

24:09.081 --> 24:11.582
for a critique if
unprepared to hear it.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.818
Once I'd calmed myself,
I realized how greatly

24:13.820 --> 24:16.620
I could benefit from
your comments on my novel.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.423
I wonder if we
could speak further.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.692
Yes, of course.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.295
Henry. Tell the Detective
I'm taking my lunch.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.597
Will you cover for me?
What's in it for me?

24:26.599 --> 24:29.533
A chance to prove
your mettle as a police officer

24:29.535 --> 24:32.470
if the Detective calls on you.
After delivering that insult

24:32.472 --> 24:34.438
about his child, I would think
you would want to make amends.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.914
Thomas, why are you
badgering me?

24:43.916 --> 24:46.350
Where did you find
Fergus Dexter?

24:46.352 --> 24:48.719
I didn't find him,
he found me.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.289
He approached me at the mansion.
I have his address in here,

24:52.291 --> 24:55.192
I'm sure, let me see. No,

24:55.194 --> 24:58.429
no, no. Ah, so many papers!

24:58.431 --> 25:01.198
Ah! Ha! Here it is.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.934
(sighing with relief):
Excellent work, Margaret.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.438
Come on, Murdoch.
Thank you!

25:07.440 --> 25:09.874
Hm!
(after sighing): Oh!

25:09.876 --> 25:13.244
Remind him he needs to send me
his invoice. Thomas!

25:16.147 --> 25:18.649
It appears Margaret
may have saved a few bob.

25:23.989 --> 25:26.390
Sir, the bullet appears
to have entered the back

25:26.392 --> 25:29.193
of Mr. Dexter's head,
and not the side.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.662
A clumsy attempt to make a
murder look like a suicide.

25:31.664 --> 25:34.298
Interesting that it
happened so soon after we told

25:34.300 --> 25:37.334
Elizabeth Pym that
Mr. Dexter was under suspicion.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.370
Makes it pretty
difficult for him

25:39.372 --> 25:41.705
to answer questions
about his connection to her.

25:44.643 --> 25:47.511
At least we have this.

25:50.148 --> 25:53.183
Done?
Done!

25:53.185 --> 25:56.287
Thank you.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.789
Father is off
to find a murderer.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.761
(Julia laughs softly.)

26:03.763 --> 26:05.930
There. And now,

26:05.932 --> 26:07.831
for Elizabeth
Pym's fingermarks

26:07.833 --> 26:11.135
in the exact
same spot.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.178
A little lower on the left.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.747
There.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.321
Alright.
Sir,

26:30.323 --> 26:32.356
what's this contraption here?

26:32.358 --> 26:34.725
It's called
a macro lens attachment.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.995
It magnifies the image so that
I can get a higher resolution

26:37.997 --> 26:40.798
photograph of just what
I need. In this case,

26:40.800 --> 26:43.300
the right index fingermark.
A higher resolution;

26:43.302 --> 26:45.769
that means you can
see more clearly?

26:45.771 --> 26:48.439
That's right.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.874
Oh, that'll
be all Henry.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.449
Sir, I didn't mean
to speak ill

26:58.451 --> 27:01.585
of your son earlier.
No offense taken.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.822
I would be proud if he would
grow up to be a stalwart

27:04.824 --> 27:07.291
young man such
as yourself, Henry.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.827
Thank you, sir.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.366
It bears repeating
that I think your novel

27:15.368 --> 27:17.935
has true greatness in it.
I just think you ought to...

27:17.937 --> 27:20.237
do away with some of
the dull bits and flesh out

27:20.239 --> 27:24.108
the parts that are more rousing.
That is sound advice.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.410
And have you
reconsidered making it

27:26.412 --> 27:28.512
"Dan of Green Gables"?
Absolutely not.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.948
Why should I?

27:30.950 --> 27:33.384
Half the world is
made up of women. I suspect

27:33.386 --> 27:35.085
there should be a large
readership for a novel

27:35.087 --> 27:38.689
with a female protagonist.
You make a good case.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.758
By the way, you need to grab
your readers right off the top,

27:40.760 --> 27:42.760
make it exciting.
I think that's

27:42.762 --> 27:44.762
the technique that made
my novel successful.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.664
How do you suggest
I accomplish that?

27:46.666 --> 27:48.465
Well, you have
the haunted wood scenes.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.235
They're just buried a long
way in. Try moving those up

27:51.237 --> 27:53.637
at the beginning.
And give us some ghosts.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.939
We need to
actually see them.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.275
And a dead body. Maud,

27:58.277 --> 28:00.344
a dead body would go a long way,
people wouldn't be able to put

28:00.346 --> 28:02.646
the book down if it had
all that at the start.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.648
I don't know about
an actual corpse, George.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.685
It's not meant to
be that kind of novel.
Fair enough, no corpse.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.754
But definitely ghosts.
And they need to DO something.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.857
You may be right.
I'm certain I am.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.993
What about
a white lady

28:15.995 --> 28:18.062
who walks along
the brook at night,

28:18.064 --> 28:21.065
who wrings her hands
and utters wailing cries,

28:21.067 --> 28:23.467
appearing when there's
a death in the family?

28:23.469 --> 28:26.236
That's perfect.
Maud, that's perfect.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.605
And then, maybe the
ghost of a murdered child

28:28.607 --> 28:30.674
who haunts the woods

28:30.676 --> 28:33.210
and creeps up behind
you, and he puts a...

28:33.212 --> 28:35.412
a cold hand
on your shoulder.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.550
And a headless man...

28:39.552 --> 28:42.619
who stalks up
and down the path

28:42.621 --> 28:44.621
and skeletons

28:44.623 --> 28:47.324
that glower from
between the boughs.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.060
Headless man? Have you
ever seen a headless man?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.730
No. Have you?

28:52.732 --> 28:53.731
I have.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.700
It's quite something.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.777
I think it would be
a good idea if your pen name

29:39.779 --> 29:41.678
was to include
all three of your names,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.814
like some of the greats:
Robert Louis Stephenson,

29:43.816 --> 29:46.416
Arthur Conan Doyle,
H.G. Wells--

29:46.418 --> 29:48.452
Louisa May Alcott.
Exactly.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.454
What a wonderful
thought, George.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.422
I do like
the sound of it.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.392
"Lucy Maud Montgomery".

29:55.394 --> 29:57.561
(glasses clinking)

29:57.563 --> 29:59.429
You know, it's one of the
great tragedies of my life

29:59.431 --> 30:01.899
that I have only one given name.
I was a foundling, you see,

30:01.901 --> 30:04.968
so my naming was rather
a utilitarian affair.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.604
You were an orphan?
Mm...

30:07.606 --> 30:11.608
I was found on the church steps
in an extremely old carpetbag,

30:11.610 --> 30:14.278
which held me and all
my worldly possessions, so...

30:14.280 --> 30:16.713
I think it's safe to say
it wasn't very heavy.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.349
(soft snicker)

30:19.351 --> 30:21.451
Did you ever come to know
the mother and father

30:21.453 --> 30:23.453
who brought you
into the world?

30:23.455 --> 30:25.989
Yeah, I did meet
my mother eventually.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.692
I remember as a child,
I used to pretend that...

30:28.694 --> 30:30.961
I was really the son
of some great earl

30:30.963 --> 30:33.664
and I'd been stolen
away by a cruel

30:33.666 --> 30:36.800
and wicked nurse who ended up
dying before she had a chance

30:36.802 --> 30:38.969
to confess.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.171
What a positively
romantic story.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.707
Were you terribly
sad and lonely?

30:43.709 --> 30:46.510
No, everything worked
out exceedingly well

30:46.512 --> 30:48.946
for me actually.
Adversity can be

30:48.948 --> 30:51.782
the making of a man.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.251
George.
Yes?

30:54.253 --> 30:56.386
Please come closer.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.636
This is a photograph
of the fingermarks

31:12.638 --> 31:14.638
that were taken from
the pistol that was found

31:14.640 --> 31:16.807
in Mr. Dexter's hand.

31:16.809 --> 31:19.443
As you can see,
they're undistinguishable.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.545
But...

31:21.547 --> 31:23.714
if I overlay

31:23.716 --> 31:26.383
these two fingermarks...

31:26.385 --> 31:28.785
like so...

31:28.787 --> 31:30.454
Now what do you see?

31:30.456 --> 31:32.823
It's the same image.

31:32.825 --> 31:35.592
Precisely. When
oriented correctly,

31:35.594 --> 31:38.061
these two fingermarks
form the one

31:38.063 --> 31:39.830
that was taken
from the pistol.

31:39.832 --> 31:41.632
And who do they belong to?

31:41.634 --> 31:44.635
Fergus Dexter
and Elizabeth Pym.

31:44.637 --> 31:47.471
Seems like her luck's
finally turned.

31:53.278 --> 31:56.413
We now have proof that
you killed Fergus Dexter.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.816
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't even know the man.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.886
I believe you do.

32:02.888 --> 32:06.189
Do you recognize this?

32:06.191 --> 32:08.959
That's similar to the gun
that's kept in my car.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.028
I assume it's a common weapon.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.463
Well, this one

32:13.465 --> 32:15.699
was found at the
scene of the murder.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.568
And it has your
fingermarks on it.

32:18.570 --> 32:22.139
As I've said, I don't
know any Fergus Dexter.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.675
And if that is my
gun, I have no idea

32:24.677 --> 32:27.411
how it was used
in the murder of this man.

32:27.413 --> 32:30.480
Now, are we done here?
Far from it, Mrs. Pym.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.183
You knew that we were
on to Fergus Dexter.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.752
So you killed him before
he could implicate you

32:35.754 --> 32:38.155
and made it appear
as though it were a suicide.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.924
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

32:40.926 --> 32:44.061
We can't arrest you for
the murders of your husbands.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.330
But we can prove that
you killed Fergus Dexter

32:46.332 --> 32:50.400
and that is enough.
I don't understand.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.637
He murdered your husbands
and you paid him well for it.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.906
I did not.
We can prove

32:55.908 --> 32:59.109
that Fergus Dexter was present
at all of your husband's deaths.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.777
Lucas Gibson,

33:00.779 --> 33:03.914
Thomas McEwan and
Bernard Cummersworth.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.750
But why?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.822
You mean... you think someone

33:11.824 --> 33:14.491
was responsible for all
of my husbands' deaths?

33:14.493 --> 33:18.061
Yes. And that person is you.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.530
Someone I don't even know

33:20.532 --> 33:24.034
killed all four of them?

33:24.036 --> 33:27.437
(She sighs.)
Excuse me.

33:33.378 --> 33:35.545
Something doesn't
make sense here.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.281
She very clearly referred
to four murdered husbands

33:38.283 --> 33:40.684
rather than five.
I wonder why?

33:40.686 --> 33:43.320
Which one
is she omitting?

33:43.322 --> 33:46.757
Could it be the first husband,
the one who fell from a bridge?

33:46.759 --> 33:49.993
The only one that
Dexter wasn't present for.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.763
Did she
kill him herself?

33:52.765 --> 33:55.332
Could I talk
to her, William?

34:05.510 --> 34:08.345
Elizabeth?

34:08.347 --> 34:10.914
tell me about your first
husband, Paul Durrell.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.850
Were you responsible
for his death?

34:13.852 --> 34:16.887
I was.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.556
He died after
falling from a bridge.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.259
Did you push him?
No.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.861
Were you present
when he died?

34:24.863 --> 34:27.631
No.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.633
Then how are
you responsible?

34:31.636 --> 34:34.337
I told him I no longer
loved him. That I wanted

34:34.339 --> 34:36.573
our marriage annulled.

34:36.575 --> 34:40.644
I drove him to it.
In his note

34:40.646 --> 34:43.647
Paul told me exactly

34:43.649 --> 34:46.383
why he was going to do it.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.985
It was all my fault

34:48.987 --> 34:51.621
I killed him.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.291
Paul Durrell
committed suicide?

34:54.293 --> 34:57.461
I knew he was unstable...

34:57.463 --> 34:59.996
he threatened suicide...

35:01.933 --> 35:04.167
...but I left him nonetheless.

35:04.169 --> 35:07.170
But there was no suicide note
in the coroner's file.

35:07.172 --> 35:10.407
It was nobody else's business.

35:12.477 --> 35:15.712
I didn't want to shame
his memory any further.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.982
I didn't kill the other four.

35:18.984 --> 35:21.952
I swear.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.254
Elizabeth,

35:24.256 --> 35:26.523
do you still have
the note that he left you?

35:26.525 --> 35:28.658
Yes, I do.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.194
I carry it with me
to this day.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.999
You started this writing class
as a means of meeting

35:36.001 --> 35:38.668
young ladies, didn't you?
Don't be ridiculous, Henry!

35:38.670 --> 35:41.505
However--
(Takes a bite from an apple.)

35:41.507 --> 35:43.673
...Maud is really
quite something.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.710
I mean, I feel she not only has
genuine potential as a writer

35:46.712 --> 35:49.813
but that she's also
my intellectual equal.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.715
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.517
You know, I'm having
dinner with her tonight.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.853
I think she could be the one.
Whoa... The one?

35:56.855 --> 35:59.322
Yes.
Which one?

35:59.324 --> 36:02.826
"Which one..."

36:05.029 --> 36:07.564
And you're certain
about the first husband?

36:07.566 --> 36:09.933
She's provided
the suicide note.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.302
Elizabeth Pym was overcome
with profound grief

36:12.304 --> 36:14.871
after Mr. Durrell's death.
Then she experienced trauma

36:14.873 --> 36:18.074
after trauma as each of her
subsequent husbands died.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.210
And you don't
think she's lying?

36:20.212 --> 36:23.013
I don't. The string
of traumas could explain

36:23.015 --> 36:25.415
her detached manner
prior to this.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.851
I suppose it's possible...
At the very least,

36:27.853 --> 36:30.420
it gives some validity to
her claim of having no part

36:30.422 --> 36:33.323
in the other husbands' murders.
If she didn't hire

36:33.325 --> 36:36.026
Fergus Dexter...

36:36.028 --> 36:38.428
then what motivated him
to kill them all?

36:38.430 --> 36:40.463
And who killed Dexter?

36:40.465 --> 36:43.300
Elizabeth claims the murder
weapon was in her automobile.

36:43.302 --> 36:47.103
Might be time to have
a word with the driver.

36:47.105 --> 36:50.006
I saw the way
you looked at her.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.742
I won't deny
I'm sweet on her.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.645
Always have been.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.481
But I'm not responsible
for any murder.

36:58.483 --> 37:01.418
Where were you between the
hours of one and 3 PM yesterday?

37:01.420 --> 37:04.020
I drove Elizabeth
to her lawyer's office

37:04.022 --> 37:06.223
for the reading of the will.
I was in the waiting room

37:06.225 --> 37:08.625
all the while.
Who else besides Elizabeth

37:08.627 --> 37:10.493
might have had access
to the car and gun?

37:12.730 --> 37:15.131
Well?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.570
This is Dr. Julia Ogden.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.241
She often consults
with me on police matters.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.943
I should disclose to you
that she is also my wife.

37:26.945 --> 37:30.513
How lovely. You work
with your wife.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.750
And what sort of Doctor are you?
A psychiatrist.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.386
Ah, a charlatan.

37:36.388 --> 37:39.689
You've had experience
with psychiatrists?

37:41.392 --> 37:43.793
You also
lost your husband.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.562
Yes. What bearing
does that have?

37:45.564 --> 37:49.032
His name was
Edgar Durrell,

37:49.034 --> 37:52.235
is that right?
What of it?

37:52.237 --> 37:54.771
Elizabeth Pym's first husband

37:54.773 --> 37:57.240
was a Paul Durrel.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.175
We were acquainted

37:59.177 --> 38:02.178
shortly after her first
husband's death.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.415
His suicide.

38:05.417 --> 38:09.419
Elizabeth's first husband
was your son, wasn't he?

38:09.421 --> 38:12.188
We know that he was.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.891
The question is, does
Elizabeth know who you are?

38:24.201 --> 38:26.202
That witch killed him.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.938
That must have hurt.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.940
How did you find out
how he died?

38:30.942 --> 38:33.009
Paul sent me a letter.

38:35.012 --> 38:37.814
She'd told him
she was leaving him.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.983
He was very distraught.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.686
I booked passage to Toronto,

38:42.688 --> 38:45.355
but by the time I arrived,

38:45.357 --> 38:48.458
my boy was gone.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.627
She is responsible
for that.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.764
And who was
Fergus Dexter?

38:54.766 --> 38:56.800
A dalliance,

38:56.802 --> 38:58.802
a friend... a lover.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.504
And your own
personal assassin.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.239
A fact that he would
have disclosed to me

39:03.241 --> 39:05.208
had I been able to speak to him.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.711
She killed my son.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.879
She deserved everything

39:09.881 --> 39:11.848
that came her way.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.251
You then
killed Mr. Dexter

39:15.253 --> 39:17.554
to cover your tracks...
(She sighs impatiently.)

39:17.556 --> 39:20.290
...and tried to frame
Elizabeth Pym for the murder.

39:20.292 --> 39:23.093
Yes. So?

39:23.095 --> 39:25.929
All these years.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.998
(with a bit of a snicker):
If you sought revenge,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.901
why not take just
Elizabeth's life?

39:31.903 --> 39:35.905
Why kill all those men
who did you no harm?

39:40.111 --> 39:44.247
Because of her,
I lost my only child.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.282
I wanted

39:46.284 --> 39:50.387
her pain to be
as enduring as mine.

39:50.389 --> 39:54.190
I wanted to cause her
so much guilt

39:54.192 --> 39:59.429
and sorrow that one day,
she could bear it no longer

39:59.431 --> 40:02.198
and she would
take her own life.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.971
I live for that day.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.374
Well, now
you won't see it.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.281
(sigh)

40:18.283 --> 40:21.084
(knocking at the door)

40:21.086 --> 40:24.621
Coming.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.927
(sigh)

40:30.929 --> 40:32.929
I waited for you.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.998
I'm sorry.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.066
May I come in?

40:44.875 --> 40:47.177
George, I must
speak with you.

40:47.179 --> 40:50.146
You are such
a robust personality,

40:50.148 --> 40:52.115
I can't help but find you
extremely appealing

40:52.117 --> 40:55.518
on every level.
That's a good thing.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.622
And that's why I didn't
come to dinner. George,

40:59.624 --> 41:02.792
there's no room in my life
for another person right now.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.994
I must return to
Prince Edward Island

41:04.996 --> 41:08.131
to care for my grandmother.
My hands will be almost full

41:08.133 --> 41:10.300
with that alone and
it will be all I can do

41:10.302 --> 41:12.202
to find ample
time to write.

41:12.204 --> 41:15.138
We've only just met.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.242
I know. And that's why
I must end this now.

41:21.178 --> 41:24.047
Romance with you
is extremely tempting.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.949
It's a detour

41:25.951 --> 41:29.452
I'm not prepared to take
at this time in my life.

41:29.454 --> 41:32.722
I must devote
myself to writing.

41:32.724 --> 41:35.758
Don't despair, George.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.162
Someone of your calibre
will not be on his own for long.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.598
Hm...

41:41.600 --> 41:45.468
I've rewritten the
first several chapters.

41:45.470 --> 41:48.671
I'd love to hear your opinions.

41:48.673 --> 41:53.243
But... if you'd
rather not, I'd understand.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.046
It would be my pleasure...

41:57.048 --> 41:59.449
Lucy Maud Montgomery.

41:59.451 --> 42:02.852
Thank you.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.189
My postal address
is on the front page.

42:06.191 --> 42:09.759
And George...
Yes?

42:09.761 --> 42:13.596
...I don't leave
until the morning.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.147
I will be asked
to speak in her defense.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.983
Of course you will.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.185
She's not of right mind.

42:36.187 --> 42:39.289
That is for the Crown
to decide, Julia, not I.

42:43.661 --> 42:47.330
Oh, Julia. How long before
children are supposed to walk?

42:49.166 --> 42:51.167
I have no idea.

42:51.169 --> 42:53.036
We should find out.

42:54.772 --> 42:57.273
Henry, listen to this:

42:57.275 --> 43:00.710
"It has all my worldly goods
in it, but it isn't very heavy.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.712
It's an extremely
old carpetbag."

43:02.714 --> 43:05.181
Isn't that how you were
found, in an old carpetbag?

43:05.183 --> 43:07.984
Yes, exactly! I'm
thrilled that she used

43:07.986 --> 43:10.186
some of the ideas that
we came up with together:

43:10.188 --> 43:12.522
the ghost of the murdered
child, the lady in white,

43:12.524 --> 43:15.625
the headless man and whatnot.
But there's something else here.

43:15.627 --> 43:18.628
What's that?
Well, she's turned

43:18.630 --> 43:21.064
the character into a spunky
orphan, found in a carpetbag,

43:21.066 --> 43:23.866
who's prone to
flights of fancy! Henry;

43:23.868 --> 43:26.502
Anne of Green Gables is me!

43:29.540 --> 43:33.943
(theme music)
