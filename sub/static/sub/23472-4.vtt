I didn'’t never think I was
gonna be 50 on stage doing this.

17:22.655 --> 17:26.620
-[laughing]
-[cheers and applause]

17:26.655 --> 17:28.551
-LL: Ain'’t nothing
wrong with it!
-Ain'’t nothing wrong it!

17:28.586 --> 17:30.517
I'’m just having fun,
man, you taking me back!

17:30.551 --> 17:33.413
-Listen, dreams don'’t have
deadlines, baby.
-Hey, none!

17:33.448 --> 17:35.206
So, Zo...

17:35.241 --> 17:38.689
Zo, how-- how many times
did your pops do this
at the barbecue?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.275
Just like this
with this outfit.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.931
I'’m not gonna lie.
I ain'’t never seen that before.

17:41.965 --> 17:43.655
LaVar:
He ain'’t never seen it!

17:43.689 --> 17:46.758
'’Cause I always keeps
a good spinnin'’ line!

17:46.793 --> 17:48.965
-Oh, we, oh, we, oh.
-[cheers and applause]

17:50.482 --> 17:52.517
LaVar, head on over
to the VIP, bro.

17:52.551 --> 17:55.034
That was amazing.

17:55.068 --> 17:57.206
And a ball was had by all,

17:57.241 --> 17:58.827
but the belt can only
go to one of them.

17:58.862 --> 18:01.103
So who takes home
this beautiful belt, huh?

18:01.137 --> 18:03.172
It'’s leather bound
and diamond encrusted.

18:03.206 --> 18:06.000
It will instantly make you
the envy of all your friends.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.034
Chrissy Teigen
not included.

18:08.068 --> 18:09.482

19:45.620 --> 19:47.965
-That'’s what makes it--
-Hey, man, he back
to being my son,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.379
