NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:02.962 --> 00:04.122
No!

00:04.213 --> 00:05.453
|Wi|| find you!

00:05.548 --> 00:08.665
QUEEN: Iwonder if you will be
quite so incorruptible

00:08.759 --> 00:10.590
after your precious Snow is gone.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.429
I do hope you like apples.

00:12.597 --> 00:13.632
HENRY: It's poison.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.008
You may not believe in the curse,

00:15.099 --> 00:17.010
but I believe in you.

00:17.101 --> 00:18.841
-(THUD)
-Henry?

00:22.106 --> 00:24.142
(GRUNTING)

00:30.489 --> 00:32.616
(PANTING)

00:35.745 --> 00:37.326
I will find you, Snow.

00:38.915 --> 00:40.621
I will always find you.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.283
GUARD 1: It'll be hard
to do that without your head.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.837
Get up, the Queen is looking
fonNard to your execution.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.802
GUARD 2: Get up. On your feet!

01:03.439 --> 01:05.179
(CHOKING)

01:19.830 --> 01:21.411
Shoot him!

01:26.504 --> 01:27.664
(GASPS)

01:28.422 --> 01:29.832
Who the hell are you?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.340
A friend.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.256
I don't know you.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.799
But I know Snow White.

01:37.890 --> 01:38.925
Is she okay?

01:39.642 --> 01:42.304
The Queen was traveling to meet her.

01:42.395 --> 01:44.431
Her fate is in a precarious place.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.932
We must hurry.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.014
Follow me. I can get you out.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.849
I'll try and stall the Queen.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.605
The rest is up to you.

01:51.696 --> 01:53.778
Your weapon and some provisions.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.115
Good luck.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.276
You're not coming with me?

01:57.368 --> 01:58.949
lcannot

01:59.036 --> 02:02.449
I gave up my heart so that
the Queen would spare Snow's.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.706
Don't let my sacrifice be in vain.
Find her.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.927
Henry, can you hear me?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.267
Come on, Henry, wake up, please!
Come on, Henry, come on.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.385
-You can do it.
-Ma'am, let me take...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.731
No, I'm not going anywhere.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.804
WHALE: Henry.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.979
There's no pupil response.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.568
What happened? Did he fall?
Hit his head?

02:32.069 --> 02:34.185
He ate this. I think it's poisoned.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.651
His ain/vay's clear. Did he vomit?

02:37.742 --> 02:38.857
Any convulsing or disorientation?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.657
He took a bite of this
and then he just collapsed!

02:40.745 --> 02:42.326
80 run the tests for arsenic
or bleach or Drano

02:42.413 --> 02:43.823
or whatever could've done this to him.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.826
The boy is showing no symptoms
that would suggest neurotoxin.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.408
So whatever's going on,
this is not the culprit.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.334
But what else could it be?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.171
I don't know.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.207
He's gonna be okay, though, right?

02:56.302 --> 02:58.088
WHALE: Right now,
we just need to stabilize him

02:58.179 --> 02:59.919
'cause he's slipping away.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.754
Is there anything else
that you can remember?

03:01.849 --> 03:02.884
Any little detail?

03:02.975 --> 03:05.352
I already told you everything.
Do something!

03:05.436 --> 03:08.178
Look, I understand you're frustrated,
Ms. Swan, I do,

03:08.272 --> 03:10.684
but I need something to treat.
And right now,

03:10.775 --> 03:13.312
there is no explanation, it's like...

03:19.283 --> 03:20.648
Like magic.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.237
H EN RY: Every story in this book
actually happened.

03:26.332 --> 03:27.367
Goodbye, Emma.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.950
You should know more than anyone.
Because you’re in this book.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.208
Find us.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.551
REGINA: Where's my son?

03:42.807 --> 03:44.263
You did this.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.813
EMMA: You did this!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.762
What the hell are you doing?

03:52.358 --> 03:53.598
Stop this! My son...

03:53.692 --> 03:54.943
ls sick because of you!

03:55.027 --> 03:57.188
That apple turnover you gave me,
he ate it!

03:57.488 --> 03:58.523
What?

03:58.614 --> 03:59.945
It was meant for you.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.272
It's true, isn't it?

04:01.367 --> 04:02.573
What are you talking about?

04:02.660 --> 04:04.446
It's true, isn't it?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.285
All of it.

04:10.543 --> 04:11.783
Yes.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.162
l was leaving town.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.664
Why couldn't you just
leave things alone?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.043
Because as long as you're alive,
Henry will never be mine.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.624
He'll never be anyone's
unless you fix this.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.753
You wake him up.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.085
I can't!

04:23.889 --> 04:25.174
Don't you have magic?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.058
That was the last of it.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.355
It was supposed to put you to sleep.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.983
What's it gonna do to him?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.531
I don't know.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.734
Magic here is unpredictable.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.409
So, he could...

04:51.500 --> 04:52.956
Yes.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.659
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:57.756 --> 04:59.417
So what do we do?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.589
We need help.

05:07.475 --> 05:11.138
There's one other person in this town
who knows about this,

05:12.730 --> 05:14.391
who knows about magic.

05:15.441 --> 05:16.726
Mr. Gold.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.897
Actually, he goes by Rumplestiltskin.

05:31.624 --> 05:33.080
Where is he?

05:33.751 --> 05:34.831
The prisoner!

05:34.919 --> 05:35.999
Escaped.

05:37.296 --> 05:41.164
A palace full of guards,
and you let him escape?

05:41.300 --> 05:42.289
I did my best.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.373
You failed!

05:43.469 --> 05:46.836
And do you know what happens
to people who fail me, Huntsman?

05:46.931 --> 05:48.341
I'll find him.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.423
You needn't worry. Leave him to me.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.891
(MIRROR TINKLING)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.103
That won't be necessary.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.811
He's mine.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.778
(GROANING)

06:29.807 --> 06:30.967
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Lost, are we?

06:33.394 --> 06:34.474
(PANTING) What are you doing here?

06:34.603 --> 06:35.638
I'm just here to help.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.227
Well, no need. I'll be fine.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.349
No, I don't think so.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.147
This is the Infinite Forest.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.402
Well, except my way.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.362
I want nothing from you.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.617
My mother's ring. It was just...

06:52.997 --> 06:53.986
How did you get it?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.868
The same way I get everything I want.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.495
Magic.

06:58.586 --> 07:03.171
The same magic that allows me
to do this.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.915
This ring is now enchanted.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.502
The closer you get to Snow White,
the brighter it will glow.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.803
Interested?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.015
-Give it to me.
-Ahl

07:12.224 --> 07:13.930
It's not something for nothing, dearie.

07:14.018 --> 07:15.428
Time to make a deal.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.975
No! No more deals.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.679
(GIGGLES)

07:20.858 --> 07:22.314
(SHOUTS)

07:22.943 --> 07:24.444
Over here.

(GRUNTS)

07:29.408 --> 07:30.397
Persistent.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.336
-Had enough?
-Never.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.969
Hmm.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.189
Looking for this?

08:09.365 --> 08:10.650
So brave.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.690
So gallant.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.613
So pointless.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.319
Bravery won't get you out
of this forest, dearie.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.494
Magic will.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.949
Trust me, this is a deal
you'll want to make.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.081
Because we both want the same thing.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.412
What's that?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.799
Why, you and your true love
to be together, of course!

08:39.436 --> 08:40.596
DAVID: Hey.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.678
David.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.941
l was wrong.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.316
About you. About me.

08:48.404 --> 08:49.985
About everything.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.438
I didn't believe in you.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.650
And Iwish I had a good reason why.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.826
But it's like I keep making
these wrong decisions,

09:01.917 --> 09:04.784
and I don't understand
why they keep happening.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.954
You know, ever since
I woke up from that coma,

09:08.048 --> 09:11.165
my life hasn't made a lick of sense.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.463
Except for you.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.003
And what I'm feeling...

09:19.810 --> 09:22.677
It's love, Mary Margaret.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.179
David, why are you here?

09:26.150 --> 09:30.143
Because Kathryn put a down payment
on an apartment in Boston.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.476
She's not gonna use it.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.990
But I am.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.950
Unless you give me a reason to stay.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.618
David.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.498
I can't.

10:04.688 --> 10:05.803
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Behold,

10:05.898 --> 10:08.389
the most powerful magic of all.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.516
True love.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.771
Ah!

10:11.862 --> 10:15.025
Careful, this is all I have left of it.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.110
What do you know of true love?

10:17.201 --> 10:21.535
Well, not so much as you, perhaps,
but not so little as you might think.

10:21.747 --> 10:24.409
You? You loved someone?

10:24.500 --> 10:28.869
It was a brief flicker of light
amidst an ocean of darkness.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.582
What happened?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.542
She died.

10:34.343 --> 10:38.006
That's the thing about true love, dearie,
it can slip through your fingers.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.473
It's the most powerful magic
in the world.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.095
The only magic powerful enough
to break any curse.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.053
It must be protected at all costs.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.478
I don't understand.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.681
What exactly is it you want me to do?

10:50.943 --> 10:52.649
I want you to help me protect it.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.398
By putting it in a safe place for me.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.363
And where's that?

10:58.826 --> 11:02.193
Inside the belly of a beast,
of course. (LAUGHS)

11:03.580 --> 11:04.865
Why hide it?

11:05.249 --> 11:06.284
Let's just say

11:06.375 --> 11:09.458
I'm saving it for a rainy day.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.369
(GIGGLES)

11:13.507 --> 11:14.622
(STORE BELL CHIMES)

11:16.802 --> 11:19.714
Do my eyes deceive me,
or is that the look of a believer?

11:19.805 --> 11:21.215
We need your help.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.682
Indeed you do.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.849
It seems quite the tragic ailment
has befallen our young friend.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.177
I told you magic comes with a price.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.478
Henry shouldn't have to pay it.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.307
No, you should.
But alas, we are where we are.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.436
Can you help us?

11:34.528 --> 11:35.938
Of course.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.524
True love, Ms. Swan.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.697
The only magic powerful enough
to transcend realms

11:40.784 --> 11:42.740
and break any curse.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.535
Luckily for you,
I happen to have bottled some.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.737
You did?

11:46.832 --> 11:48.197
Oh, yes.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.908
From strands of your parents' hair

11:51.003 --> 11:53.961
I made the most powerful potion
in all the realm.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.631
So powerful that when I created
the Dark Curse,

11:57.718 --> 12:00.926
I placed a single drop on the parchment.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.045
Just a little safety valve.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.217
That's why I'm the savior.
That's why I can break the curse.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.597
Now you're getting it.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.098
I don't care about breaking the curse,

12:11.189 --> 12:12.395
all I care about is saving Henry.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.188
Which is why it's your lucky day.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.982
I didn't use all the potion.

12:17.195 --> 12:20.187
I saved some for a rainy day.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.610
Well, it's storming like a bitch.
Where is it?

12:22.701 --> 12:25.864
Where it is, isn't the problem.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.286
Getting it is what should worry you.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.624
REGINA: Enough riddles.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.914
What do we do?

12:31.001 --> 12:32.787
You do nothing.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.993
It has to be Ms. Swan.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.418
He's my son, it should be me.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.494

12:36.590 --> 12:39.923
but it's her son, and it has to be her.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.092
She's the product of the magic.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.840
She must be the one to find it.

12:43.931 --> 12:44.966
I can do it.

Don't trust him.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.180
That's right, dearie.
What choice do you have?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.931
Where is this magic?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.684

gonna screw me over again?

34:56.011 --> 35:00.425
and tell you that Regina locked me up.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.183
Does that mean anything to you?

35:12.653 --> 35:14.018
GOLD: You're real.

35:16.198 --> 35:17.358
You're alive.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.449
She did this to you?

35:21.954 --> 35:24.195
l was told you'd protect me.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.031
Yes!

35:29.712 --> 35:31.794
Yes, I'll protect you.

35:32.381 --> 35:35.623
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

35:38.679 --> 35:42.046
No. But you will.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.471
No.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.558
(SOBBING)

35:50.649 --> 35:51.638
No.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.253
I love you, Henry.

36:26.769 --> 36:28.259
(GASPING)

36:32.524 --> 36:33.639
I love you, too.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.359
You saved me.

36:39.615 --> 36:40.946
You did it!

37:14.650 --> 37:17.187
Henry, what's going on?

37:17.277 --> 37:18.437
No.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.024
The curse,

37:21.949 --> 37:23.405
I think you broke it.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.487
That was true love's kiss.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.322
No, no!

37:29.832 --> 37:33.074
If I were you, Your Majesty,
I'd find a place to hide.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.245
no matter what you think,

37:38.340 --> 37:40.456
no matter what anyone tells you,

37:41.927 --> 37:44.168
I do love you.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.198
Snow!

38:12.040 --> 38:13.371
Charming.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.039
(EXCLAIMS IN DELIGHT)

38:24.553 --> 38:26.168
You found me.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.638
Did you ever doubt I would?

38:51.288 --> 38:52.744
(SOBBING)

38:57.836 --> 38:58.996
Wait.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.748
GOLD: No, no, we're very close.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.589
Rumplestiltskin, wait.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.049
I remember.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.606
I love you.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.940
Yes.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.569
Yes.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.234
And I love you, too.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.691
But, hey,

39:31.578 --> 39:33.284
there'll be time for that.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.658
There'll be time for everything.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.285
But first,

39:39.294 --> 39:41.455
there's something I must do.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.212
What is this?

39:52.641 --> 39:54.677
This is a very special place, Belle.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.842
The waters that run below

39:56.937 --> 40:00.350
are said to have the power
to return that which one has lost.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.310
Henry, what's going on here?

40:44.901 --> 40:47.813
If the curse is broken,
why didn't they go back?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.065
I don't know.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.525
(GLASS SHATTERING)

40:52.534 --> 40:53.774
Are you okay?

40:53.869 --> 40:56.281
(RUMBLING)

41:13.722 --> 41:15.178
What is that?

41:16.558 --> 41:18.059
Something bad.

41:20.062 --> 41:21.552
BELLE: I don't understand.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.272
And I'm bringing it.

41:26.902 --> 41:29.735
Magic is coming.

41:30.781 --> 41:31.861
But why?

41:32.074 --> 41:33.234
”Why?”

41:34.076 --> 41:35.566
Because magic

41:37.079 --> 41:38.569
is power.
