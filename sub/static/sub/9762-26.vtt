WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:10.416
Vegeta, as much pride as you have,
you let yourself be controlled by that guy

00:10.636 --> 00:12.968
just because you wanted to get stronger?

00:13.180 --> 00:17.014
|-| wanted...

00:17.226 --> 00:22.391
I wanted... to go back to who I was before!

00:22.606 --> 00:25.814
I wanted to go back to being
the savage, cold-blooded Saiyan l was,

00:26.026 --> 00:30.235
not caring about anything
except wanting to fight you all-out!

00:31.865 --> 00:36.029
The fierce battle between Goku and Vegeta,

00:36.245 --> 00:40.454
who had returned to being
an evil warrior, went on.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.829
And as for Majin Boo's ball...

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:02.646 --> 01:06.559
At long last, the seal had been released.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.782
Boo!!

03:06.228 --> 03:12.144
"Straightaway |nto Despair?!
The Terror of Majin Boo."

03:47.019 --> 03:48.259
Not bad, Vegeta!

03:48.478 --> 03:50.139
There's more to come!

04:23.972 --> 04:27.931
Babidi-sama, i-is that Majin Boo?

04:28.143 --> 04:29.508
|-| don't know.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.937
I've never seen him before.
The only one who has seen Majin Boo

04:34.149 --> 04:36.435
is Kaioshin over there.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.692
U-Um, is that Majin Boo?

04:42.908 --> 04:48.824
Y-Yes, it is. H would never
forget that terrifying face!

04:49.915 --> 04:53.828
Oh?! It sounds like that is Majin Boo after all!

04:54.044 --> 04:56.376
Th-That guy...?

04:59.967 --> 05:03.050
Hey! Majin Boo!

05:05.180 --> 05:08.263
When you said "Majin,"
l was expecting something bigger.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.887
|-|t is hopeless now. We cannot get away.

05:11.103 --> 05:16.564
Are you sure about that?
Sure, he may possess an off-the-scale Ki...

05:16.775 --> 05:19.482
...but it doesn't seem so bad
that there isn't anything we can do.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.937
D-Do you really mean that, Gohan-san?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.819
Yes. If I muster all the power l have...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.972
Boo!!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.979
M-Majin Boo!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.286
Majin Boo!

07:09.888 --> 07:10.798
Damn it!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.221
Wait, Vegeta! Wait!

07:14.351 --> 07:16.592
A huge Kijust appeared!

07:16.812 --> 07:20.179
Majin Boo has finally emerged!

07:43.046 --> 07:47.380
Majin Boo, huh? As much of
a badass as l was expecting,

07:47.592 --> 07:50.584
sure enough, that's the kind
of battle power rating he has.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.420
I knew this would happen.

07:53.640 --> 07:58.805
Listen here, Kakarrot.
We've become too strong for them!

07:59.020 --> 08:02.228
I'm talking too strong by half.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.773
One would normally expect Kaioshin
to be enormously powerful,

08:05.986 --> 08:09.274
but have you ever once
thought he was all that great?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.607
Instead, Kaioshin was the one
who got thrown for a loop.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.115
From Kaioshin's point of view,
that may be the terrible Majin Boo,

08:17.330 --> 08:21.744
but from where we stand,
he really isn't all that tough.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.201
N-No, you're wrong.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.207
There's something about
this Ki that ain't normal.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.879
Stop your prattling!

08:28.091 --> 08:30.582
If you're trying to get out
of our fight, it won't work!

08:30.802 --> 08:33.839
Vegeta! You have to be picking up on this, too!

08:43.732 --> 08:46.314
Hey, M-Majin Boo!

08:48.737 --> 08:52.855
I am Babidi, the child of your creator, Bibidi!

08:53.074 --> 08:56.407
I brought you back out of the ball
you were sealed inside

08:56.620 --> 08:58.531
for an awfully long time!

09:01.374 --> 09:05.993
Uh, th-that means that as of today,
I am your master!

09:15.513 --> 09:19.426
Hey! What's the matter?!
Say hello! Say hello to me!

09:19.643 --> 09:22.680
I am your master!

09:22.896 --> 09:24.887
Hey, Majin Boo!

09:28.818 --> 09:30.103
H-Hey...

09:30.320 --> 09:33.187
W-What's the matter, Majin Boo?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.508
Tch, he's just an idiot.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.136
W-What is that he's doing?

10:07.691 --> 10:09.556
Why, you...!

10:09.776 --> 10:11.391
For what reason I cannot say,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.648
but it appears that his
revival has been a failure.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.946
Here I finally thought he had arrived,

10:17.158 --> 10:20.650
but he is a powerless, mindless,
dopey-faced bag of garbage.

10:23.707 --> 10:28.201
Hmph. What? You got
something to say about that?

10:31.006 --> 10:32.746
That does it!

10:40.473 --> 10:44.933
What? You want to start something
with the great Dabra-sama?

10:46.980 --> 10:50.893
You don't know your place,
which is why I called you an idiot!

10:53.445 --> 10:56.983
It does appear that Majin Boo
is a flop, Kaioshin-sama.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.282
You call that a flop? That is Majin Boo!

11:21.473 --> 11:24.306
Hmph! Nothing but a load of worthless hot air.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.902
F-F-Fantastic...!

12:19.906 --> 12:22.192
That was amazing, Majin Boo!

12:22.409 --> 12:25.492
Imagine, defeating Dabra as easily as that!

12:25.703 --> 12:28.945
Absolutely fantastic!

12:30.083 --> 12:35.703
|-|t shot up! Majin Boo's Ki shot up with a bang!

12:35.922 --> 12:38.629
H-He's strong... He's beyond strong!

12:38.842 --> 12:41.003
His strength is unbelievable!

12:45.682 --> 12:47.764
That just turned into a phenomenal Ki.

12:47.976 --> 12:52.436
This Majin Boo guy ain't no
average customer, all right!

13:08.872 --> 13:13.161
J-Just now, for a second,
we sensed a tremendous Ki, right?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.832
U-Uh-huh.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.581
W-What's going on, for crying out loud?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.788
Hey, which way should we go?

13:20.008 --> 13:24.877
Huh, good question.
The Ki this way is kind of eerie, isn't it?

13:25.096 --> 13:26.802
That one must be the Majin!

13:27.015 --> 13:30.633
Yeah! That Majin seems like
he's more interesting, huh?

13:30.852 --> 13:34.515
--Uh-huh!
--All right, that settles it!

13:34.731 --> 13:36.847
--Woo-hoo!
--Whee!

13:44.699 --> 13:46.860
This ain't the time to be doing this!

13:47.076 --> 13:50.034
We're the ones who let that monster loose!

13:50.246 --> 13:53.704
What do I care?!
It's got nothing to do with our fight!

13:53.917 --> 13:58.377
Everyone's gonna get killed!
Everyone! Even Bulma and Trunks!

13:58.588 --> 14:00.670
Sh-Shut up!

14:00.882 --> 14:05.467
I sold my soul to Babidi
to get rid of my soft side!

14:05.678 --> 14:09.637
I don't care what happens to who now!

14:11.434 --> 14:12.423
That ain't true!

14:24.447 --> 14:27.905
It ain't like you sold
your soul over completely.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.665
All right.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.624
We'll put the fight on hold.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.426
Apparently, you're so
caught up over Majin Boo

14:49.639 --> 14:52.096
that you can't focus on us.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.343
Vegeta!

14:53.560 --> 14:55.926
Hand over one of those senzu whatsits.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.182
Both of us have used up
quite a bit of our strength.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.889
Yeah...

15:01.901 --> 15:05.234
If we all go at him together,
I'm sure we can beat Majin Boo.

15:25.758 --> 15:30.127
I guess not even you can help it
when you get taken by surprise.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.785
I'm the one who set Majin Boo free;

15:56.998 --> 15:58.784
I'm the one who'll take care of him.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.375
l'll settle the score with you after that.

16:04.839 --> 16:08.832
Hmph, if I'm still alive, that is.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.196
Amazing! Amazing!

16:32.408 --> 16:35.946
Now, Majin Boo, do as | tell you to!

16:36.162 --> 16:39.950
Got that? I am your new master.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.794
A-Are you sure you want to defy me?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.501
I've looked through my
papa's notes, and I know...

16:53.721 --> 16:57.805
...the incantation to seal you
back inside your ball.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.009
You don't want to go
back inside there, do you?

17:01.229 --> 17:03.220
Eh? Eh?

17:07.819 --> 17:12.108
All right! That's better! That's better!

17:12.323 --> 17:17.157
Kaioshin-sama, Majin Boo is still
something of a child, isn't he?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.531
If we can defeat Babidi over there,

17:19.747 --> 17:22.829
isn't there a chance that he
won't do anything too rash?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.000
N-No, without Babidi around,

17:26.212 --> 17:30.706
there will be no way to seal up
Majin Boo once again.

17:30.925 --> 17:35.168
Appearances aside, Majin Boo
really is a horrific monster.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.175
He is sure to grow out of
Babidi's control soon enough,

17:38.391 --> 17:42.304
and the time will definitely come
to seal him back inside that ball.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.853
Until that time comes, all we can do
is put up with what happens.

17:47.066 --> 17:53.357
|-| am so frustrated that even I,
as Kaioshin, cannot do anything!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.739
It was not supposed to be like this.

17:56.951 --> 18:01.445
l was confident that we could defeat Babidi
and prevent Majin Boo from being revived.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.655
l-lfl had known this--

18:03.875 --> 18:07.618
If I had known that there were
mortals such as yourselves around,

18:07.837 --> 18:11.796
whose power exceeded my own
to such an extent as this...

18:12.008 --> 18:14.044
...there was another way...

18:15.052 --> 18:16.588
What other way?

18:16.804 --> 18:22.390
No, it is too late now.
We can no longer escape from Majin Boo.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.059
The two of us are not likely
to get out of this alive.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.602
What are you talking about?!

18:26.814 --> 18:29.476
We can manage to get out of here,
one way or another!

18:29.692 --> 18:31.273
All right!

18:31.486 --> 18:37.197
Now, Majin Boo, your first order!
Kill the two of them!

18:39.035 --> 18:41.117
Boo!!

18:41.329 --> 18:42.865
Kaioshin-sama!

18:49.837 --> 18:54.297
W-What are you waiting for, Boo?!
They're getting away!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.429
H-He's gone...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.952
|-|t can't be!

19:34.173 --> 19:36.038
Die, you!!

19:48.771 --> 19:53.105
Way to go, way to go, Majin Boo!
Do it! Do it! Kill him!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.369
Gohan-san...

21:19.946 --> 21:21.777
N-No way!

21:21.989 --> 21:26.779
W-What's this? Majin Boo is a royal terror,

21:26.994 --> 21:30.236
with extraordinary speed and power!

21:30.456 --> 21:35.667
The terror of death lurks
behind that cold-blooded smile!

22:41.986 --> 22:43.567
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.779 --> 22:46.031
Get out of there, Gohan! This Majin Boo guy

22:46.240 --> 22:48.356
ain't someone that we can handle ourselves!

22:48.576 --> 22:52.945
Now it's our turn, Majin Boo!
Give it back to them, and then some!

22:53.164 --> 22:55.029
Gohan-san, look out!

22:55.249 --> 22:56.910
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.126 --> 23:01.119
"Turn Into Candy!
A Hungry Majin's Bizarre Power."

23:01.338 --> 23:05.251
Oh, no... Even Dabra was
powerless to stop him...!
