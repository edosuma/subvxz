00:33.840 --> 00:36.320
<i>You think you've
had a bad day at work?</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:38.406
<i>I think I got you beat.</i>

00:43.120 --> 00:44.167
<i>That's not me.</i>

00:46.920 --> 00:48.410
<i>Nope, that's my partner.</i>

00:58.400 --> 00:59.447
Suck it!

01:00.360 --> 01:01.679
<i>There I am.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:04.160
<i>Three or four days ago, I
didn't know this world existed.</i>

01:07.680 --> 01:09.519
<i>But three or four days ago,</i>

01:09.520 --> 01:11.648
<i>I wasn't in the Rest
In Peace Department.</i>

02:04.840 --> 02:06.490
Boo!

02:08.880 --> 02:10.723
I heard you coming a mile away.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.131
Look at this, French girl gets
the drop on Boston's finest.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.170
You got the drop on me, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.924
But I feel like
a genius right now.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.690
I couldn't have
planned this better.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.241
Well, genius, there is an
orange tree in the backyard.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.244
How did that get there?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.402
Oh, yeah, there is an orange
tree in the backyard.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.766
How weird.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.526
Hmm.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.931
I don't know how it got here.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.411
Me neither.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.244
You know it's a symbol of
prosperity, don't you?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.606
No, I've never heard that.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.079
His, yeah.
Ask anyone in Florida.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.399
No, you're crazy.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.448
This tree is never gonna
make it through the winter.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.399
We might not make
it through the winter

02:47.400 --> 02:49.799
in this freezing little house!

02:49.800 --> 02:52.451
I love our
freezing little house.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.799
You do, do you?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.928
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.284
But don't you want more?

02:58.680 --> 02:59.841
You're always
worried about money.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.604
Don't you want
a real house? A car?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.525
I don't worry
about money, you do.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.921
I have everything
I need right here.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.566
My husband, with me.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.964
Well, you'll always have that.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.281
I gotta go to work.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.124
I'll tell you when
you can go to work.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.328
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.928
Hey!

03:36.640 --> 03:39.041
Watch that ankle.
I love you, baby.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.401
Bye. Love you.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.159
Got my picture in
a trophy case, I see.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.049
Look at that.
Already immortalized.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.249
Right place, right time.
What can I say?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.084
Hey, Bobby.
Hey.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.406
Murph! Jesus, get a
robe or something.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.523
You're asking too
much of that towel.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.927
Morning, partner.
Morning.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.845
Hey, guys.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.603
Love to have you at the union
meeting Monday.
Oh!

04:21.760 --> 04:23.205
No, no!
Sweet Jesus, Murphy.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.328
I will shoot that thing.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.561
That's pretty devastating.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.166
It's gonna be a while before
I get that image out.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.167
Hey,
what did you do with yours?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.044
I buried it.
Really?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.239
I thought you were joking about that.
But it's not the worst idea.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.527
It's gold,
you bury it. Right?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.770
Listen, Bobby.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.521
I'm out.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.082
You're out?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.281
Look.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.880
Nothing has to change for you.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.801
You do whatever you want, but I'm
putting mine in evidence. It's done.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.719
Nicky, I said
I would move it for us.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.960
I'll take care of everything.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.399
That's not what I'm
talking about, Bobby.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.359
I'm talking about the way she
looked at me this morning,

05:05.360 --> 05:06.439
I knew.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.967
Look, we went in there to make
a drug bust, which we did.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.199
We didn't expect this gold
to fall into our laps.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.043
We weren't looking
for it, but it happened.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.799
The way I see it,
you do it for Julia.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.119
For your future together.
It's simple.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.361
No, she's happy.
I'm not gonna risk that.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.044
I'm sorry, buddy.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.727
You're right.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.208
I hate it when you're right.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.049
We gotta turn
the whole thing in.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.882
There goes the speedboat.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.166
Look.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.959
You don't have to worry, I'm
not wagging my finger at you.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.279
You do whatever you want to do.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.408
No, it's bothering me, too.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.879
So, let's grow old
and poor together.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.451
Listen up, we got Garza.
We got an address.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.199
Wait, you got Garza? You
got actual eyes on him?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.850
An informant gave up
his whole meth operation.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.291
He's there, we got him.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.039
Okay, we're
in business, partner.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.088
Get another picture
in the trophy case.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.079
You know how long we've been
waiting for Garza to slip up.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.039
This guy's a meth dealer, a cop killer.
He's got 30 guys with him.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.239
He's not gonna go easy.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.959
Now, stand by for inspiring,

06:19.960 --> 06:22.119
motivating words
from Detective Bobby Hayes.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.884
How about we don't
get shot today?

06:24.240 --> 06:26.439
That's great advice.
You're a good cop.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.959
Detective Hayes advises
we should avoid getting shot.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.519
And also, everybody should put
their charm bracelets on now.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.399
Hey, that's my grandmother's

06:33.400 --> 06:35.159
Saint Christopher
medal, jackass.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.319
It's adorable.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.606
I wear it for protection.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.119
It's for protection?
Well, this stops bullets.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.248
Yours stops you
from getting dates.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.561
Let's go!

07:04.440 --> 07:06.363
Move it! Move it!
Let's go!

07:18.040 --> 07:19.883
On my lead. Let's put
them on their heels.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.526
Hey. Be safe,
will you?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.201
Knock, knock.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.846
Police officer!

07:55.960 --> 07:57.679
Take the stuff out of here.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.603
Bag the stuff!
Bag the stuff!

08:08.960 --> 08:10.325
I see Garza.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.799
He's on the catwalk!

08:48.520 --> 08:51.285
Damn it! Garza's
out the south window.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.199
Jesus!

08:54.200 --> 08:55.999
Whoa. That was close.
What the hell are you doing?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.047
You almost got me.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.046
But,

08:59.760 --> 09:01.603
I can't let you
turn that gold in.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.566
What?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.923
<i>My husband, with me.</i>

11:31.200 --> 11:32.645
Tough day.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.523
It's normal to be a little
tongue-tied at first.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.968
I want you to know
that I'm here to help you.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.125
I've sat in that chair.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.328
So take your time.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.841
Ease into it.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.051
Ease into what?

11:50.480 --> 11:53.563
Come on, genius.
I know you can get there.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.121
This is a joke.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.128
Hilarious. Ha-ha-ha.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.121
I'm dead?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.159
Let's be honest,
being a dirty cop

12:07.160 --> 12:09.606
is one of the higher
shot-in-the-face-percentage jobs.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.879
That's not who I am.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.999
Really, pretty boy?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.479
How did it feel as you were
headed towards Judgment?

12:17.480 --> 12:18.527
Comfortable?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.519
Feel like you
were bound for glory?

12:20.520 --> 12:22.966
Or were you a little worried
that you were going down?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.486
I thought so.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.685
You're lucky, Nick.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.839
You have skills that we want.
So we're giving you a choice.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.889
You can take your
chances with Judgment,

12:36.720 --> 12:37.721
or,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.002
you can join the R.I.P.D.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.519
The R.I.P.D?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.329
Rest In Peace Department.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.962
I get it. It's cute.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.001
Simply put

12:53.360 --> 12:57.331
we find dead people that have
managed to escape Judgment.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.559
We ship them off back down
to where they belong.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.519
The tour is 100 years.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.519
If you say yes, we'll send you back
down to Boston, your home turf.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.851
I'll do it.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.200
That's not gonna work.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.879
What's not gonna work?
I said I'm in.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.519
I know what you're thinking. You got
rooked, you want your old life back.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.521
You want Julia.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.810
No. You asked me to help you,
and I'm here to help.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.926
You really don't think
I can read you?

13:28.240 --> 13:31.562
I know everything there is
to know about you.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.599
Don't squander
this opportunity, Nick.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.762
I know for a fact
you can use a good

13:36.920 --> 13:39.082
recommendation on
Judgment Day, okay?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.361
I think you're smelling
what I'm selling.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.321
Any more questions?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.571
What's with the Steely Dan?

13:51.880 --> 13:55.362
No idea.
It's always playing.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.006
It seems to relax people.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.805
Let's do this.
Yes, let's.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.051
This Will tickle a bit.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.647
What the...

14:28.080 --> 14:30.401
Clench 'em and get over here.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.730
Hey, are you my lawyer?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.040
Settle down!

14:53.920 --> 14:56.651
This is holding.
We call them "Deados."

14:58.720 --> 15:01.166
Until they pop, they
look like regular people,

15:01.320 --> 15:04.244
so no one except us knows
they're monsters inside.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.879
You see, if you
slip through the cracks

15:06.880 --> 15:08.239
and stay on Earth
after you die,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.639
your soul rots.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.559
If they rot, the world rots.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.326
Global warming, black plague,
bad cell reception, get it?

15:15.480 --> 15:16.759
Without the R.I.P.D.,

15:16.760 --> 15:18.159
the world would
have been overrun

15:18.160 --> 15:20.919
by these dead people
some time in 1954.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.968
How is staying an option?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.999
A hundred-and-fifty-thousand
people die every day.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.970
This system wasn't designed to
handle that kind of volume.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.762
Welcome to the big league.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.922
R.I.P.D. Boston.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.399
Before you are the greatest law
officers who ever lived and died.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.767
We're the third biggest
precinct in the force.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.839
What's the first?

15:51.840 --> 15:53.319
Boca.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.159
R.I.P.D. Scottsdale
does a lot of volume, too.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.686
Trust me, chest hair is
making a big comeback.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.729
I'm telling you, chicks dig it.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.167
It's a lot to take in
on your first day dead.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.648
But don't worry, your partner
will explain it all to you.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.166
No! Get your
hands off me!

16:15.960 --> 16:18.088
I said, get your hands

16:18.240 --> 16:19.685
off

16:20.400 --> 16:22.687
me!

16:33.920 --> 16:35.081
Come on, Roy.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.247
Oh, you come on.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.687
Just because I'm the only
one willing to lethal-up.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.887
Oh, Jesus.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.322
No, you Jesus!

16:43.240 --> 16:44.969
Roy!
What?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.604
He was going for the door.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.770
I'll plant a gun on him if it
makes you feel any better.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.764
Would you like to take this
up with Eternal Affairs?

16:55.600 --> 16:59.605
We both know what this is
about, don't we, honey pot?

16:59.800 --> 17:00.926
Not the time, Roy.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.767
Why not have it out now?
I'm comfortable.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.164
Roy, meet your new partner,
Nick Walker.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.807
We've been over this before.
I'm a one-man operation.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.121
Not a choice, Roy.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.481
No. You gotta earn that.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.248
Come on, rookie.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.642
Grab your <i>huevos.</i>

17:40.560 --> 17:43.484
<i>Please follow
all posted regulations.</i>

17:43.880 --> 17:47.362
<i>Department hygiene regulations
are for your benefit.</i>

17:50.760 --> 17:53.286
Tuck on in.
Don't be shy.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.805
Goin' for a ride.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.999
You ever think about hiding
this place a little better?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.083
When was the last time
you got a VCR repaired?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.847
Point taken.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.444
That's right, you're back.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.331
Don't wet your pants
over it. Come on.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.363
Don't wanna be late.
Proctor likes to

18:28.520 --> 18:30.443
start you off
with some closure.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.325
Get in!

18:59.200 --> 19:01.726
Disappointing turnout, huh?

19:03.240 --> 19:05.083
Expected more.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.683
We got a lot to talk about,

19:10.840 --> 19:13.366
but for now,
I'm just gonna step back,

19:13.520 --> 19:15.648
let you soak it in
for a minute.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.569
This moment is not about me.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.722
This is about you

19:25.360 --> 19:26.199
letting go.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.611
Thank you for
letting me soak it in.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.288
I'll wait for you.
All right.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.122
Do you know
what my funeral was?

19:48.600 --> 19:51.843
Watching a bunch of coyotes
pick my carcass clean

19:51.960 --> 19:54.281
and drag my bones
off into a cave.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.240
A freaking cave, hoss.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.961
Here it comes.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.329
Be careful, now!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.648
Julia? Julia!

20:25.680 --> 20:29.048
I'm here. I don't
know how, but I'm here.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.170
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.241
Can we just talk?
Can we just...

20:34.360 --> 20:35.486
Please don't touch me.
...go somewhere?

20:35.640 --> 20:36.926
Julia? Hey, Julia!

20:40.480 --> 20:42.608
What's your problem, huh?

20:43.600 --> 20:45.090
You piece of shit.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.725
Get out of here.
Just relax.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.368
Get back on the meds, buddy.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.041
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

20:55.840 --> 20:56.841
Let me go!

21:03.720 --> 21:05.324
That went well.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.719
I tried to do
something nice for you.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.131
What just happened?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.199
How could
she not know it was me?

21:11.200 --> 21:15.359
To them, you don't look like
you, you don't sound like you.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.799
If you try to tell 'em who you
are, it comes out all garbled up.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.609
The universe,
in its ultimate wisdom,

21:20.720 --> 21:22.563
will not let you
reveal yourself.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.364
It's smarter than us.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.211
That's sick.

21:26.760 --> 21:30.199
Consider it the universe's
witness protection program.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.319
So, what do I look like?

21:31.320 --> 21:32.321
Here.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.368
These are your IDs.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.121
Some federal. A lot of utilities.
Whatever gets us access.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.404
Really?
An old Chinese guy?

21:46.760 --> 21:47.921
What about you?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.760
Well, I guess you win, Roy.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.444
Let me bring you up to
speed with what's on my plate.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.842
When you ride with me,
you ride with the best.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.279
The pace is lightning,
expectations high.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.799
Things are gonna come at you
fast, they're gonna come hot,

22:41.800 --> 22:42.881
and they're gonna come wet.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.561
Wet?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.239
Learn to drive, bimbo!

22:49.240 --> 22:51.447
You've done this before?
Driving?

22:52.160 --> 22:56.324
You're gonna get your feet
wet with a standard pickup.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.999
Find the suspect
and then test him.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.002
See if he's a Deado.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.846
And then...

23:05.440 --> 23:08.639
Look at the ankles
on that girl.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.041
That's what you're into, ankles?
That's what does it for you?

23:11.160 --> 23:13.686
In my day, women, they
dressed very conservatively.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.244
Mmm. That makes you
way less creepy.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.039
When exactly was your day?

23:20.040 --> 23:22.279
1800s, buddy.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.760
I'm what we used
to call a "lawman."

23:25.280 --> 23:27.760
Marshal Roicephus Pulsipher.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.161
"Roicephus"?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.607
It was considered a very
sexy name at the time.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.410
It sounds like an STD.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.851
Would you care to drive?

23:41.480 --> 23:43.482
I didn't get a peek
at your wife's ankles.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.449
Not one more word about her.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.411
Listen, rook.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.164
You better work on getting a little
distance, because you two are over.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.199
You just worry
about yourself, partner.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.359
Whoa.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.408
You ain't my partner, rook.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.086
You're just the ass in the other
seat until I say contrary.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.089
I had a partner.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.408
Greatest man I ever knew.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.244
Right up until
he shot me in the back.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.159
That's what
"partner" will get you.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.961
Tell me about it.
How do you think I got here?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.487
You got shot with
a modern bullet.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.490
I would've loved a modern bullet.
Sanitary, at least.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.759
That's exactly how it felt as
it passed through my face.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.807
Sanitary.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.769
The term "partner"
died when I did.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.201
You got it, Roicephus.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.368
"Roicephus."
Roicephus.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.679
Just call me "Roy."

24:29.680 --> 24:31.170
I was gonna do that.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.328
Or "Cephus."

24:33.840 --> 24:35.330
Now, listen up.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.841
This is tactical, rook.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.599
Tactical?
A bag of Indian food?

24:41.600 --> 24:45.889
Yeah. I got a tip on a possible
Deado in this building.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.405
Now, listen and learn.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.566
Deados put off a bad dead mojo.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.368
Infect everything
with their soul stank.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.048
Infect everything
for the worse.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.929
People and things.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.722
There you go. Broken
shit is a dead giveaway.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.246
Ah.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.810
Soul killers.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.285
Hit a Deado in the head with one of
these, and it's got to be the head...

25:24.440 --> 25:26.761
Personally, I find
the face most gratifying.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.883
...he's erased
from the cosmos.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.999
Won't hurt live ones,
will hurt us.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.839
So, you be extra careful
where you point that thing.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.763
I'm pretty solid on gun safety.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.924
I saw that ankle piece
you're strapping.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.959
Live-world gun don't
do diddly-squat here.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.804
You can keep your eyes off
my ankles, thank you.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.482
Watch me sniff this out.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.689
Even more promising.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.922
It's always the quiet one.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.162
You ready? You pumped?

26:29.800 --> 26:32.371
I need you all here. Get
your snowman on, get frosty.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.849
Alert, icy-hot.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.287
Is this you trying
to sound like a cop?

26:37.440 --> 26:39.281
Because it throws up
a lot of red flags for me.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.206
You gotta learn the lingo,
<i>hombrito.</i>

26:43.200 --> 26:46.090
I'm frosty.
Don't worry about it.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.211
Senior officer
gets to knock, rook.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.964
I've got 15 years on the force.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.684
Knock off
the "rookie" bullshit.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.882
Oh, you've done this before?

26:55.040 --> 26:58.169
You know what's waiting
for you behind the door?

26:59.040 --> 27:02.328
You can take your 15 years, you
can flush it down the toilet,

27:02.480 --> 27:04.679
because this ain't that.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.047
I knock, you do the cards.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.050
Stanley Nawicki.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.290
We're with
the Department of Health.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.159
Is there a problem?

27:28.160 --> 27:29.571
Well, Mr. Nawicki,

27:29.720 --> 27:32.724
we suspect that
you might be dead.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.761
Is this really necessary?

27:35.880 --> 27:37.119
No offense, but you
sound kind of crazy.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.246
None taken.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.161
Just a routine test and
we'll be out of your hair.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.084
I am not dead.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.211
I mean, that's...
Check my pulse, go ahead!

27:46.360 --> 27:48.010
Rook, first question.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.084
"It's late
on Ash Wednesday."

27:53.240 --> 27:56.244
"An Asian teenager
in a slammed-out Acura"

27:56.400 --> 27:59.404
"offers you a plate
of chicken vindaloo."

28:00.280 --> 28:01.406
"Do you accept?"

28:04.040 --> 28:05.451
How am I supposed
to answer that?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.011
You tell me.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.524
Okay, the answer is no.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.159
What's the problem?
Is it the teenager?

28:16.160 --> 28:18.083
The ash?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.962
Is it the Japanese
performance sedan?

28:22.600 --> 28:23.681
Maybe it's the Indian food.

28:23.800 --> 28:24.881
What?

28:25.040 --> 28:27.008
Maybe you hate Injuns.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.090
No. That's...

28:29.280 --> 28:30.281
Card.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.719
"The teenager is Armenian.
The day is Rosh Hashanah."

28:34.720 --> 28:37.564
"The dish is saag paneer."

28:38.640 --> 28:40.119
Uh...

28:40.120 --> 28:41.121
I don't want it.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.321
Why not?

28:43.040 --> 28:45.646
Too spicy? Too mushy?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.479
You...

28:49.480 --> 28:52.086
- You can't eat during an interview.
- I don't want...

28:52.200 --> 28:53.690
You don't what?

28:53.840 --> 28:55.171
Card!

28:56.080 --> 28:58.719
"The car is a lime-green Scion.
The season is the solstice."

28:58.720 --> 29:01.166
"The dish is
chicken tikka masala."

29:01.680 --> 29:02.999
- No.
- Yes.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.239
No.
Yes, it is!

29:04.240 --> 29:07.005
The dish is chicken tikka!
The dish is chicken tikka!

29:10.920 --> 29:12.922
Oh, yeah, that's a Deado.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.805
Big old mouth coming in.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.685
Feller was a snitch in life.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.447
See, Nick?
Like that. Metaphorical.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.328
For some reason, Indian
food seems to do the trick.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.527
Maybe it's the cumin.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.839
You can bag this one.
My treat.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.479
No. I'm not
going near that.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.847
Where's that
15 years now, frosty?

29:36.000 --> 29:40.483
You gotta get comfortable with the
visuals and the smell profile.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.279
All right.
Go on!

29:43.280 --> 29:44.959
Spread 'em.
Come on, let's go.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.564
Hurry up, let's
get this over with.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.199
Once they pop,
they know it's over.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.279
Right, pal?

29:51.280 --> 29:53.362
Put all your hands
behind your back.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.285
Stupid space cuffs.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.687
Hey!

30:09.600 --> 30:10.601
No!

30:15.400 --> 30:16.401
You want it?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.199
Ah!

30:19.200 --> 30:20.804
You got it!

30:23.120 --> 30:24.884
Nick! Grab him!

30:25.120 --> 30:27.088
Get the rest of him!

30:27.360 --> 30:28.407
Contain!

30:38.080 --> 30:39.081
Holy shit.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.284
Giddyup, pony!

30:54.440 --> 30:55.487
Whoa! No, no!

31:00.480 --> 31:02.050
Relax your body!

31:02.200 --> 31:03.406
What?

31:03.640 --> 31:05.210
Relax body!

31:16.720 --> 31:18.768
Give me a reason.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.365
Doesn't have to be a good one.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.404
Actually, doesn't
even have to make sense.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.199
Fun, right?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.999
You might have noticed
we're pretty durable.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.525
It still hurts.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.603
That's why rook's the bottom.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.444
Bottom.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.527
Bottom!

31:42.720 --> 31:44.119
Okay.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.600
I guess that's
emotionally understandable.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.731
You're really gonna
rummage through that?

32:16.920 --> 32:19.446
Brief after-action report.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.282
Now, you were below
average in the room,

32:23.800 --> 32:28.679
but you did respond well to my
steering during the airborne portion.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.843
Your internal organs provided
me a very soft landing.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.924
You have a very
impressive crumple zone.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.969
With the exception
of letting yourself

32:37.080 --> 32:39.039
get attached
directly to the beastie...

32:39.040 --> 32:40.119
Stop talking.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.521
...you were solid.
C-plus.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.091
Stop talking.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.004
Just doing my job.
Stop it. Stop talking!

32:46.160 --> 32:47.320
You're the one who's talking.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.403
You ran your mouth
at my funeral.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.648
You ran your mouth when you
pushed me out of a building,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.211
and used my body as a cushion.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.601
You've run your mouth non-stop
since the minute we met!

32:55.760 --> 32:57.239
I think I know
what's going on here.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.642
No, no, no! Shut up! You
shut up and let me deal.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.001
All right, you deal.
Deal with the upchuck.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.286
Come to think of it,
with all this tantrumery,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.919
I'm beginning to think that I might
have been a little too generous

33:10.920 --> 33:12.684
with the "plus" on that C.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.042
I might just have
to lower your grade.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.641
Relax body.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.768
My hat!

33:26.760 --> 33:27.886
My hat!

33:28.560 --> 33:30.130
My hat!

33:36.000 --> 33:37.650
New grade. F!

33:38.640 --> 33:40.449
The bus, I can forgive.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.524
My hat? I can't even
talk about that now.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.081
Let's go, go, go!
Time is a factor. Let's go.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.481
What the hell is this?
A fire drill?

33:48.640 --> 33:49.959
I never seen it this busy.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.519
Seems like every Deado
moved to Boston last week.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.439
What did I say?
Get back out there.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.284
No breaks for anyone until
this surge is under control.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.279
If I didn't need you
back on the streets...

33:59.280 --> 34:01.119
What? You'd have my ass?

34:01.120 --> 34:02.279
Don't be a cliché.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.199
You let him get out the window.
Aren't you better than that?

34:04.200 --> 34:07.039
You're the one who put me
with training wheels, here.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.958
But go on, make a show.
Be the boss.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.599
You still have a hard time with
the "boss" part, don't you?

34:11.600 --> 34:13.489
You played the game,
got what you wanted.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.605
I don't play the game.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.607
And my ass is
mine and mine alone!

34:18.760 --> 34:20.639
Eagerly noted!

34:20.639 --> 34:22.608
Come on.
It's flat, anyway.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.639
Roy, Nawicki was trying awfully
hard to protect this gold.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.559
Don't you think we should try
to figure out what it is?

34:33.560 --> 34:34.686
Trust me, it's nothing.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.007
Ninety-nine percent of
these things are just

34:37.159 --> 34:39.478
fundraising items
for various religions.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.844
Just crap.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.366
What about the one percent?

34:43.840 --> 34:45.839
That's why we
lock them up in here.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.679
Bag it,
tag it and bury it deep.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.279
Is that all of it?
That's it.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.804
Sign here, please.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.439
Roy, listen.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.519
What?

35:19.520 --> 35:21.399
Nawicki cared an awful
lot about that gold.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.526
Yeah.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.159
He was trying to
hide it from us. Why?

35:25.160 --> 35:27.401
So, now
you're all gung-ho, huh?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.759
I'm thinking
we should follow up.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.240
Let me guess.
Genius has a plan.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.879
Genius wants to get out on
the street and work this.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.199
I think that you
can help me with that.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.124
You know why? Because every
great cop that I've ever known

35:40.240 --> 35:41.719
has their own informant.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.085
Big Roy...

35:43.880 --> 35:45.882
Big Roy, he's gotta have one.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.799
You want an informant?

35:52.800 --> 35:55.087
Big Roy's got
the best informant.

35:58.920 --> 36:03.562
<i>Now batting for the
Red Sox, number 34, David Ortiz.</i>

36:03.760 --> 36:06.604
Elliot.
He's a pain-in-the-ass Deado.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.719
All he cares about is the Sox.

36:09.720 --> 36:13.281
So, I let him stick around
in exchange for information.

36:14.680 --> 36:15.761
Here.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.088
You're in mourning.
You got a hole to fill.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.279
You know, I can't
taste anything.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.519
Of course not, you're dead.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.199
R.I.P.D. don't eat,
we don't sleep.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.839
You're here to kick Deado
ass, that's about it.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.519
Then why would you eat this?

36:34.520 --> 36:36.409
I enjoy the mouth feel.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.124
How's it going, Elliot?

36:45.840 --> 36:46.959
We're up.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.645
But they're hitting like
crap. We'll blow it.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.723
Knock yourself out.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.639
Hello, Elliot.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.961
One of your buddies was willing
to get erased for this.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.369
Why?

36:59.440 --> 37:00.646
Rook.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.479
That belongs in evidence.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.209
I thought you were
some kind of rebel, Roy.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.603
I fought for the North.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.487
Would you mind terribly if I
got back to my investigation?

37:14.640 --> 37:16.369
Go continue your investigation.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.206
Tell me what this is, Elliot.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.599
That looks like
a big hunk of gold.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.280
Uh-huh. That's not gonna
cut it. Try again.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.646
Hey! Hey! Get
your hands off me!

37:32.160 --> 37:33.999
You behave
yourself now, Elliot.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.163
Because of me, you're sitting there
all cozy and not lying in a pine box.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.488
Not walking the desert, trying to
get your femur back from a coyote.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.559
You cops are all the same.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.642
Always obsessing
about how you bit it.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.959
How was your funeral, newbie?

37:47.960 --> 37:53.126
Did you cry when they gave your wife
that nice folded-up flag?

37:55.720 --> 37:56.801
Hey.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.041
That's fun, right?

37:58.200 --> 38:00.319
I think we both know there's
no Red Sox on the other side,

38:00.320 --> 38:01.526
so why don't you cooperate?

38:02.880 --> 38:05.486
I apologize for
my poor attitude.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.879
May I take a closer look, sir?

38:08.880 --> 38:10.086
You may.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.489
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint,
but this is crap.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.599
Look, Deados,
they're sentimental.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.719
A lot of them believe
in this talismanic junk.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.406
If it was something else, there'd
be some chatter out there.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.399
I would know.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.209
All right, we're done here.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.083
These hats are crap.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.005
Keep your ears open for me.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.531
Yes, sir.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.359
You gave him the gold?

38:52.360 --> 38:55.239
Did you see him squirm?
We got him.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.119
"Got him"? What do you
mean, "we got him"?

38:57.120 --> 38:58.359
What did we get?

38:58.360 --> 39:00.328
Tell you what he got,
he got the gold!

39:00.440 --> 39:02.124
Which you gave him!

39:02.720 --> 39:04.160
What the hell is
the matter with you?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.763
I'm pissed about my hat.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.605
Well, then.
Looky, looky.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.919
I'm gonna treat you to a
little modern law enforcement.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.119
This is called
"giving the dog a bone."

39:19.120 --> 39:20.167
Bones?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.086
What's he doing?

39:34.800 --> 39:35.879
Okay, that's weird,

39:35.880 --> 39:38.319
because that looks
exactly like your ex-partner.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.810
The one who shot you dead.

39:45.960 --> 39:50.648
Okay, I'm interested.
Color me interested.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.282
This must be chafing you, huh?

39:58.800 --> 40:00.882
First, the guy smoked
you like a knockwurst,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.999
and now he's got guys
just handing him gold.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.319
Let me think,
just let me think.

40:04.320 --> 40:08.120
What's there to think about? The man's
just schooling you left and right.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.926
Your own partner.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.161
And the trifecta.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.285
Sleeping with your wife.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.081
Because this is
your house, isn't it?

40:33.080 --> 40:35.401
Total humiliation.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.530
It's just a pants-down
spanking in the supermarket.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.962
He's not sleeping with Julia.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.760
Want to bet?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.359
Yeah, let's.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.806
Winner shoots the loser in the
face as many times as he wants.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.209
I'm not 100 percent
confident with my read.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.371
Some cannolis from Mike's.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.565
I was thinking how Nick used to

41:00.720 --> 41:02.210
make us stop and
get them for you.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.804
Thank you.
Thank you, Bobby.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.564
Hey, Julia, did Nick
seem all right to you?

41:12.880 --> 41:15.929
I mean, was he
concerned about anything?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.640
No.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.121
Okay. Okay.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.479
Why?

41:24.480 --> 41:27.404
I'm sorry I got to do this now.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.924
Nick said he buried something.

41:32.160 --> 41:36.324
If he's not sleeping with her, it's
kind of funny he's here, isn't it?

41:37.400 --> 41:39.243
Unless you guys
have a pact where he

41:39.360 --> 41:41.239
scrubs the porn off
your laptop for you.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.287
I get that.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.569
Classy, actually.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.919
He gave this to me.
He knew I wanted it.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.759
What are you saying, that he just did
this to hide something under it?

41:56.760 --> 41:57.886
I don't know.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.242
But I've got to take a look.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.290
I was hoping I was wrong.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.810
Really? He stole this?

42:24.400 --> 42:25.526
Oh, God, I feel sick.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.885
You crooked son of a bitch. When
were you gonna tell me about this?

42:30.440 --> 42:32.249
Put the gun down.
Shut up.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.519
Just get it away from me.
I don't want to see it.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.648
Don't worry.
Don't worry about a thing.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.165
He was my best friend.

42:40.760 --> 42:42.967
I don't even know who he was.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.724
Get off of me or
I'll break your legs.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.126
Explanation, now!

42:55.840 --> 42:58.839
We took something
from a bunch of shit-rats

42:58.840 --> 43:01.119
who would have turned it into
guns or drugs or who knows what.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.319
It was a victimless crime.
End of story.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.879
Why would the Deados want it?

43:04.880 --> 43:08.039
You think Hayes and I
knew about this Deado shit?

43:08.040 --> 43:10.566
It was just money to me. I was
trying to make our life better.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.849
Well, you did a good job
of that, didn't you?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.599
Why don't you go try
the Chinaman thing again?

43:16.600 --> 43:18.090
Explain it to her.
That went well.

43:21.680 --> 43:22.920
Try it again if it makes you...

43:24.840 --> 43:26.365
Gold's getting away.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.519
Come on, tighten up.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.879
My wife sees me
as a piece of shit.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.009
Actually, she sees you
as an old Chinese guy.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.079
And by the way, Grandpa
Chen's a pretty solid look.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.491
Helps with stakeouts.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.759
The only thing that I ever cared
about is what she thought of me.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.888
That's all that matters.
The only thing.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.399
What she thinks,
that's who I am.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.926
And I blew that.
Destroyed it.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.599
Boo-hoo.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.759
Excuse me?

44:35.760 --> 44:37.364
You heard me. Boo-de-hoo.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.721
You might be the worst
person I've ever met.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.204
Sadly, you do not get to tell
her how you did it all for her.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.239
And where exactly do you
think your tragedy ranks

44:51.240 --> 44:53.439
on the scales of
cosmic injustice?

44:53.440 --> 44:55.329
Pakistan-earthquake level?

44:55.960 --> 44:57.879
Killing Fields level?
For me, it was pretty big.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.439
You think you're the only one
who was cut down in his prime?

45:01.440 --> 45:03.559
You don't think
I felt unresolved

45:03.560 --> 45:05.767
as my face was being
devoured by a buzzard?

45:06.040 --> 45:07.087
Oh, Christ.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.084
You are just gonna have to learn
to sit on your regret and pain

45:10.280 --> 45:12.965
until it turns into
a dull, persistent ache.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.885
The way I do it.
The way a man does it.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.770
I do music videos.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.888
Home phone number's
on the back.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.491
Excuse me?

45:33.480 --> 45:36.439
I'm not a piece of meat put on
this earth for your gratification.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.519
I'm a woman.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.161
Respect me, or I will castrate
you like a three-year-old steer.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.570
Look sharp.
We got something.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.049
Oh, yeah, that's a Deado.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.208
That has got
to be Hayes' fence.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.009
We stay on the gold.
I got this.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.199
Hold up.
Daddy's on point.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.359
No thanks,
I've seen you in action.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.839
You questioning my methods?

46:29.840 --> 46:31.365
You don't have a method.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.444
Excuse me, sir.
A quick word?

46:45.760 --> 46:47.046
Freezer.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.287
Allow me.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.411
My bad.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.441
Let me guess.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.404
R.I.P.D., huh?

47:04.920 --> 47:06.763
Great looks, man!

47:06.920 --> 47:09.241
You, with your Panda
Express over there.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.243
Easy with the racial.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.765
And you, with your...

47:12.920 --> 47:13.967
Watch it!

47:14.120 --> 47:16.043
...magnificent breasts.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.084
Hey, sideburns,
tell us about the gold.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.841
Look, we're all friends here.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.930
Let's help each other out.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.323
You don't want to get popped, and
I don't want to pop you.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.239
Oh, you don't?
No.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.519
So you're just gonna give us that
case, you're gonna start talking,

47:34.520 --> 47:36.090
and then you get to
keep roaming around

47:36.200 --> 47:37.770
with your bitchin'
ginger sideburns.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.411
You know what?

47:46.960 --> 47:48.644
I'm sick of hiding.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.282
Whoo!

47:56.800 --> 47:59.724
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.285
That's better!

48:07.640 --> 48:11.611
Hell, yeah. Let's do this!

48:15.920 --> 48:17.445
Contain!

48:19.200 --> 48:20.565
Contain!

48:23.160 --> 48:24.366
Didn't contain!

48:33.520 --> 48:34.885
Suck it.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.728
Oh!
Straight butt!

48:43.680 --> 48:45.011
Come on!

48:46.120 --> 48:47.565
It's rodeo time.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.370
Pappy's got some roping to do!

48:53.200 --> 48:55.202
How about a little help?

49:14.200 --> 49:15.361
Okay.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.519
Are you okay?
Somebody call 911!

49:17.520 --> 49:19.719
I'm okay. Nothing to see.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.165
Got to go!

49:21.400 --> 49:22.561
Hey!

49:36.560 --> 49:38.483
The head!
Aim for the head!

49:48.760 --> 49:50.603
Still here, you son of a bitch!

49:59.840 --> 50:00.841
Ow! My ass!

50:01.040 --> 50:02.883
What is that?

50:14.400 --> 50:15.559
Whoo-hoo!

50:15.560 --> 50:16.641
Coming through!

50:18.520 --> 50:20.124
Excuse me, pardon me.
Yeehaw!

50:47.520 --> 50:48.806
Here I come!

50:49.800 --> 50:50.926
Yeah.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.685
Relax body.

51:24.840 --> 51:26.524
Whoo-hoo!

51:42.440 --> 51:43.566
Rook!

51:45.440 --> 51:46.441
Over here!

51:47.040 --> 51:48.849
If it's not too much trouble.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.361
Thank you very much.

52:01.520 --> 52:04.039
I've never seen
one like that before.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.119
Never!

52:05.120 --> 52:06.919
Never before has this happened!

52:06.920 --> 52:09.879
Congratulations, guys, on
your unprecedented cock-up!

52:09.880 --> 52:10.919
All right!

52:10.920 --> 52:14.239
You let an exposed Deado loose on the
streets in the middle of the day.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.599
You were supposed to contain.
That is your most basic job.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.759
There was no containing that thing. And
you failed spectacularly to contain.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.719
He's right, sweetie pie.
It was different.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.879
We have evidence.

52:21.880 --> 52:25.319
You don't investigate, you don't get creative.
You do as you're told.

52:25.320 --> 52:26.879
When you don't, this happens.

52:26.880 --> 52:27.959
<i>It was terrifying.</i>

52:27.960 --> 52:31.646
<i>Whatever rampaged through the streets
of Boston today was not human.</i>

52:32.280 --> 52:35.399
Now look where we are.
You get to deal with them.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.719
Who in this endless stream
of freaks is "them"?

52:37.720 --> 52:39.961
Eternal Affairs.
The hammer's dropping.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.205
Well?

53:04.960 --> 53:07.008
They're pissed.
Justifiably.

53:07.120 --> 53:09.930
However, apparently, you stumbled
upon something important.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.561
Don't act
so surprised, honey pot.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.759
The gold that officers Pulsipher
and Walker brought in

53:16.760 --> 53:19.119
are part of an incredibly
dangerous artifact

53:19.120 --> 53:21.282
known as the Staff of Jericho.

53:25.680 --> 53:27.011
Oh, crap.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.403
Maybe feather it in for
the new guy a little bit?

53:33.520 --> 53:37.559
Remember the tunnel we pulled
you out of when you died?

53:37.560 --> 53:41.119
That's the only way to get to the afterlife.
It's a one-way street.

53:41.120 --> 53:44.639
This artifact, if built,
reverses the tunnel.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.324
The dead rain
down on the earth.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.044
That's it for the living world.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.639
Yeah, massive destruction.

53:49.640 --> 53:53.008
We broke it to pieces 3,000 years ago.
Now it's back.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.845
Until we get the rest of the
gold, we're on red alert.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.725
Also, apparently, you need
"the blood of thine enemy."

53:58.920 --> 54:00.239
There are more diagrams.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.321
Why?

54:01.840 --> 54:04.519
Why would someone
make something like that?

54:04.520 --> 54:05.851
Come on!

54:06.320 --> 54:10.079
Here I am, willing
the streets into order,

54:10.080 --> 54:13.239
making headway,
year after dominant year!

54:13.240 --> 54:15.319
And now, everything I've
done is being threatened

54:15.320 --> 54:18.159
because of some ancient
totem forged for kicks

54:18.160 --> 54:20.759
by some asshole
5,000 years ago?

54:20.760 --> 54:25.004
Why even try? I mean, how
am I supposed to do it?

54:26.360 --> 54:28.761
Look at you.
So proud of yourself.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.200
"I got an important tube."

54:37.080 --> 54:38.366
What?

54:39.680 --> 54:40.920
Well, what is it?

54:44.880 --> 54:46.450
Actually,

54:46.600 --> 54:48.762
it looks like
you two don't need to

54:48.880 --> 54:51.042
concern yourselves
with the red alert.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.043
It brings me no pleasure

54:53.560 --> 54:56.919
to inform you that because
of your recent epic failure,

54:56.920 --> 54:58.888
you've both been suspended,
you're off the case.

54:59.280 --> 55:00.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

55:00.720 --> 55:02.404
Hold on a sec, we are the case.

55:02.520 --> 55:04.170
We're the ones
who brought it in!

55:04.400 --> 55:06.039
The feeling is that
luck was involved.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.610
There'll be
a formal hearing tomorrow,

55:07.720 --> 55:09.370
after which you'll
most likely be erased.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.647
"Erased"?

55:12.880 --> 55:15.884
So in this moment of crisis,
they're gonna suspend

55:16.000 --> 55:18.651
and then erase
their best officer?

55:19.240 --> 55:20.765
And this other guy?

55:21.240 --> 55:22.765
Better officers
are taking over.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.371
No such thing. Name one.

55:24.560 --> 55:25.971
Jacobson, DuBow.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.239
Waterson.
Come on.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.279
Carson.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.770
Jackson.
He's pretty good.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.649
That guy who works
at the taco cart.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.279
Shall I go on?
Okay, okay!

55:33.280 --> 55:35.123
Tomorrow is my last day?

55:35.280 --> 55:37.089
Most likely.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.606
I'm sorry.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.445
Well, shit.

55:42.320 --> 55:43.599
Miss Proctor,
it's been a delight.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.679
Roy, thank you very much
for your mentorship.

55:45.680 --> 55:47.039
I'm sure it meant a lot to you.

55:47.040 --> 55:49.850
I got somewhere
more important to be.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.521
Who are you?

56:32.200 --> 56:33.884
Why are you following me?

56:36.520 --> 56:38.124
Stay away from me.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.442
I haven't left you.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.411
It's me.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.320
No.

57:12.600 --> 57:13.681
So.

57:15.840 --> 57:19.199
Congratulations.
You finally did it.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.247
You get what you wanted?

57:21.600 --> 57:24.046
I might get erased tomorrow.
What do you think I'm gonna do?

57:24.400 --> 57:27.370
You're freaking her out,
if you haven't noticed.

57:28.520 --> 57:31.171
I'm not from a time of
sensitivities and emotionalism.

57:31.440 --> 57:34.879
And yes, in my day, I
bought my love by the hour.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.531
But I do know that what
you're doing is not helping.

57:38.400 --> 57:41.882
It's called haunting, hoss.
You're causing her pain.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.039
Why do you think we're here?

57:45.040 --> 57:47.281
Why we do what we do?

57:47.400 --> 57:50.085
It's so that Julia can
have a world to live in.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.648
And, yeah,
that means without you.

57:53.400 --> 57:57.849
She needs to survive you. Meet
someone new, maybe have a family.

57:58.560 --> 58:01.086
Because you are
not coming back.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.160
Even

58:03.400 --> 58:05.119
The job is all you have now.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.726
Well, we don't
have the job anymore.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.324
Nick.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.639
Resolve your crap.
Do like me.

58:12.640 --> 58:13.559
Like you?

58:13.560 --> 58:15.439
Yes, emulate my peace.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.568
Your Zen-like calm?

58:17.680 --> 58:20.490
It's taken me a very long
time to achieve this state.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.919
You could get there, too,
but for your weakness.

58:22.920 --> 58:24.239
You know what?
I've had it.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.767
I can't listen to one more self-righteous
chestnut out of your mouth.

58:28.440 --> 58:31.599
I don't want to live
in your weird past with you.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.001
Speaking of which,
those coyotes...

58:34.280 --> 58:35.359
You be careful now.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.079
Those coyotes who ate your bones
and crapped out your face?

58:38.080 --> 58:41.439
In that story,
the coyotes are the heroes.

58:41.440 --> 58:42.559
Hey.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.799
You may think the Old West
was all shits and giggles,

58:44.800 --> 58:47.159
and sarsaparilla
and two-cent whores.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.399
It wasn't!

58:48.400 --> 58:50.759
It was smelly, it was violent.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.599
It was ridden with dysentery
and no-account Injuns.

58:53.600 --> 58:57.571
I've had a lot of anger
to get past, okay?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.286
And you...

58:59.800 --> 59:02.119
You, Nick, are
bringing a lot of shit out

59:02.120 --> 59:05.841
that I've been suppressing
for a very long time!

59:11.960 --> 59:13.769
One of them coyotes,

59:14.440 --> 59:16.090
he made love to my skull.

59:17.600 --> 59:20.285
Do you know what that
practice is commonly called?

59:21.320 --> 59:22.481
I do.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.080
And I certainly hope
he got both eyes, Roy.

59:33.160 --> 59:38.166
<i>Words,
like daggers stab our heart</i>

59:38.720 --> 59:40.609
<i>Boys</i>

59:41.480 --> 59:45.485
<i>Gotta be the better man</i>

59:45.880 --> 59:47.080
The song is called <i>Better Man.</i>

59:47.200 --> 59:48.725
Yeah, I got that.

59:48.880 --> 59:53.010
<i>People,
they can break your heart</i>

59:53.680 --> 59:55.489
<i>Boys</i>

59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.246
<i>Like no coyote ever can</i>

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.488
Maybe I took things
a little too far.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.205
"Maybe"?

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.525
I'm sorry.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.360
You ought to take up
an instrument, Nick.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.928
It might be
a tuneful way for you

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.122
to spend what may
be your last moments.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.841
You were right
about the job, Roy.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.525
We gotta get back out there.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.411
"Sus-pen-dato."

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.887
If they want me back,
they're gonna have to beg.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.168
I'm not gonna take
this lying down. You?

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.890
Are you gonna
sit there and mope?

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.089
Or do you want to help me
stop an apocalypse?

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.322
When you put it that way, hell,

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.568
you kind of
paint me into a corner.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.559
I know Hayes is sitting
on some of that gold.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.528
There's no way
he's just a bagman.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.888
Let me ask you something.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.122
Did he like Indian food?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.123
He was not a fan.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.641
But something's bugging me.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.367
I rode with this guy for five
years, I never noticed any kind of

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.250
"soul stank."

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.770
I heard talk of a rare kind of
artifact that could mask it.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.447
Like a spiritual deodorant.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.445
It would be something he
carried with him all the time.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.448
Like Grandma's
Saint Christopher medal.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.806
That'd do her.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.769
Let's go pop
the son of a bitch.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.811
Do you know what to do?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.645
Oh, yeah. I've been
waiting a long time for this.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.639
You've been
waiting a long time?

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.159
Do you know how many years Deados
have been trying to pull this off?

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.479
Three thousand.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.121
Not one of those jag-offs could
get all that gold together,

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.765
until me.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.801
R.I.P.D. is not
gonna know what hit them.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.682
Now, go find
yourself some trouble.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.530
My pleasure.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.079
<i>Hey, Julia.</i>

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.959
Hey. I need to talk to you.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.883
Something really
strange happened to me.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.159
What's going on?

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.759
<i>I was at the track last night,</i>

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.922
and do you remember
that guy at the funeral?

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.241
The little Chinese guy?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.999
<i>The one who was yelling?</i>

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.799
Slow down, slow down.
Take a deep breath.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.479
I don't know.
Somehow, I feel like

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.801
it's Nick who's
trying to talk to me.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.320
Okay.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.724
I know it sounds crazy.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.002
<i>I know you miss him.
I miss him, too.</i>

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.124
I don't think you
should be alone right now.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.439
<i>I'm gonna come pick you up, and
I'm gonna take you to lunch</i>

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.920
and we could talk
about everything.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.645
All right?

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.521
Okay.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.971
All right.
Thank you for this.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.760
Absolutely.
I'll see you later.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.519
Take the front.
I'll go around back.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.045
Works for me.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.721
Bobby Hayes?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.719
Yeah?

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.768
I need to ask you
a few questions

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.002
involving a tandoori clay oven.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.640
Sweetheart, you can ask
me anything you want.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.091
Make yourself comfortable.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.761
How about
a little drinky-poo?

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.966
Sure. I'll wet my beak.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.451
Coming right up.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.242
Are you looking for this?

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.450
Nice moves,

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.607
Nick.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.282
Hey, tough look to pull off.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.407
I'm getting used to it.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.040
You know, it was just business.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.519
Make a move, please.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.521
Easy, Nick.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.639
"It's late on Ash Wednesday."

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.563
We can skip that part, Roy.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.680
Take off the Saint
Christopher's medal.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.401
Now.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.481
Okay.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.531
Powerful stank.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.365
Where's the gold, dead man?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.681
Check the water heater.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.851
Freaking super cop, here.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.129
All right, saddle up.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.729
We're gonna ride you in.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.359
I know it's wrong,

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.126
but the whole cowboy-talk thing,
it's kind of working for me.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.444
What do you got to smile about?

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.199
Hey, how do you like
working with this guy?

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.801
He hangs on a little
tight to stuff, huh?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.559
What we got together is
none of your damn business.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.239
Where's the rest
of the gold, Hayes?

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.607
See what I mean?
He won't let it die.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.199
Hey, Nick,
remember when I got shot?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.560
I got that medal, and you couldn't
believe I pulled through?

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.279
Wild guess,
you didn't pull through?

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.159
Get killed by some
junkie and go to hell

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.079
because I took a little on the
side to pay for lap dances?

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.919
No. I don't think so.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.759
Who gets to make that call?
I don't accept it.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.919
Hey, let me ask you something.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.320
What do you think eternal
punishment is gonna be like, Hayes?

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.399
Hell can kiss my ass.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.731
I'm staying right here.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.729
"Lap dancing."

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.759
That's a nice look you got.
That's nice, with the face and the hair.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.171
All right, sit down.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.689
Hey. You might
want to book that gold

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.604
before your partner
gets his hands on it.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.801
What's this?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.279
That's personal.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.884
Then it gets booked,

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.568
along with this gold
that I brought in.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.962
That's right, doll face. Despite
my chicken-shit suspension.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.487
I'm available for
a tutorial-type thing,

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.959
if you or the guys
want a few tips.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.799
Maybe get yourselves
up near my level.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.559
Why did I have to love you?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.050
We had a beautiful
moment in time.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.719
Catastrophic mistake.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.485
Run it down, but you
felt what you felt.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.286
Take a seat.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.879
This is good,
it's gonna help me

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.450
get over the
shot-in-the-face thing.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.326
Whatever is waiting for you on
the other side is gonna be bad.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.925
Don't worry, it's only forever.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.679
Stash this gold
with the rest of it.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.966
And here.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.159
Hey, we just booked
something just like this.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.002
It's in the basket over there.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.839
You're gonna need to
fill out another form.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.606
I'd love to. I've got
nothing else better to do.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.807
There's one decent thing
about being a Deado, right?

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.158
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.640
We can't hear certain
frequencies so well.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.881
Roy!

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.087
Come on, Nicky.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.725
You thought I'd
let you bring me here

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.559
if I didn't want to
be here all along?

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.959
Isn't this thing sweet?

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.399
It freezes you guys up,
does nothing to us.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.482
They got one of these
artifacts for everything.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.319
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.720
Go, go, go!
Come on!

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.805
Get the gold.
Take everything!

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:25.559
It's all there?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.685
Uh-huh.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.118
Catch!

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.087
Fill up all these hands.
Come on!

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.363
Let's go! Let's go!

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.520
What's up?

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:50.611
Peace.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.126
Flush it.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.770
No! The gold!

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.131
Here, boss.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.487
I got it all.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.171
I'm on it.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.759
Daddy's got gold!

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.240
Let's build it, boys!

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.284
Yeah!

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.891
Oh. yeah!

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.283
Damn it!
It's jammed up.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.364
Just like Main Street,
Dodge City.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.564
Them dudes,

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.842
they picked the wrong venue
to make a stand.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.168
I invented this shit.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.121
Hot!

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.484
I fixed it! Yeah! Phew!

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.411
Go time!

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.323
Let's learn you a few things
about Old West fighting.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.686
First,

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.159
only a novice hides
in a church steeple.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.322
It's the first place
I'm gonna look.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.681
Second place,
hotel window, every time.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.281
Hmm.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.761
I guess there's only
one novice in their crew.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.967
Sometimes, the window
guy is on the roof.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.802
I haven't seen that before.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.930
Must be the massive destruction
Proctor was talking about.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.846
Saddle up!

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.961
Hey, Julia.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.049
Hayes sent us to
give you a lift.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.039
Guys, I can still drive.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.451
It's pretty hairy out there.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.723
He's just worried about you.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.999
Close it up.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.999
All right. Lock it up.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.599
Nobody gets through
to the Commonwealth building.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.090
Nobody!

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.087
Looks like the big one is right
over the Commonwealth building.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.359
That's where he'll be headed.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.725
Yeah. Good read.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.409
You're agreeing with me?
That's weird.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.683
Yeah. Feels strange.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.685
Kind of tingly.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.319
Deados on wheels.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.519
That's disappointing.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.284
I was hoping to get
a little break here.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.730
Make it go away, Nick!

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.400
I got it.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.685
Holy shit!

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.239
That actually scared
the shit out of me.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.439
Get the gold up top.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.920
I gotta wait for
the final piece.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.639
Hey. Are you okay?

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.719
What the hell is going on?

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.959
Lots going on. I'm glad
you're here with me.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.166
We need to get inside.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.319
Listen. There's something
I should tell you.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.879
It's something
I've been hiding.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.239
Bobby, I think it can wait.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.004
And it might
seem a little weird.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.799
But I think you should just
try to keep an open mind,

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.167
and not judge right away, okay?

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.761
Oh-ho!

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.441
Eh?

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.403
<i>Skycam 4 is on the
scene with continuing coverage.</i>

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.479
<i>We are looking
down on the Commonwealth building</i>

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.159
<i>which is swarming with, there's
really no other way to say this,</i>

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.279
<i>monsters.</i>

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.203
I urge everyone to stay inside
until this situation...

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.481
<i>Dave!</i>

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.521
Wicked.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.810
Looks like they
built a barricade.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.645
And there's Fat Elvis.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.885
Hit him in the jiggly.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.479
Whoa!

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.369
Hi! Whoa!

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.766
Not bad!

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.761
My door!

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.881
Can't shake me!

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.449
Still here, dicks!

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.481
Oh.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.486
Relax body.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.207
Death.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.047
I hope they have an elevator.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.246
Oh, shit.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.759
Reverse the tunnel,
the dead come pouring back.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.569
We stay here forever.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.643
Kind of
a high-five moment.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.486
All we gotta do is
fire up this bad boy.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.441
Yeah!

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.287
Okay.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.804
This is where it gets
a little uncomfortable.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.039
There's no great way to say
this, so I'll just say it.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.039
These ancient things, they
often involve an element of,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.759
I don't want to say
"human sacrifice,"

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.959
but human sacrifice.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.122
I'll jump before
you can even touch me.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.207
Julia, come on. Be cool.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.610
This is an honor. I'm trusting
you with the heavy shit.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.126
Julia!

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.369
Oh-ho! Just in time.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.891
Bobby! Don't!

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.001
No!

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.646
Move!

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.481
Nice shot.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.200
I'm gonna go get Julia.
You take care of the Staff.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.723
That golden pecker
is coming down.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.127
You frosty?

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.569
Icy hot, partner.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.201
What now, Nick?

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.639
You know, it didn't
have to be Julia,

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.479
but I just couldn't resist
bringing it full circle.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.801
Come on.
It's good, right?

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.041
Ow!

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.565
Get over here!

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.125
How's it coming, Roy?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.368
It's harder than it looks!

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.569
Killing you never
gets old, Nicky.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.047
Any time now!

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.725
I hear you!

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.369
Come on, Roy!

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.570
Do some cowboy stuff!

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.520
Please!

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.681
Roy!

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.446
There it is.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.561
No.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.251
Well, partner.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.609
I have a new partner.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.810
I missed you.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.167
I missed you so much.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.121
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.124
It's okay,
you're back with me now.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.084
That's all I wanted.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.050
But not like this.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.325
Julia,
you gotta live your life,

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.926
without me.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.642
I don't want to say goodbye.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.484
You can't stay here.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.443
It's okay.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.287
Go.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.410
I will always love you.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.641
Goodbye.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.919
She's gonna be okay.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.921
Thank you.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.724
You owe me for that.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.319
Let's settle up.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.519
Sure.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.879
I would like to be allowed
to design my own medal.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.881
Not so fast.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.850
The Eternals went ahead and had

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.530
your disciplinary
hearing without you.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.759
While we were saving the world?

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.079
Nick, as a new recruit, you've
been let off with a warning.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.366
Reasonable.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.403
Roy, as punishment...
"Punishment"?

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.879
Yes. Fifty-three more years
have been added to your term.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.006
Fifty-three years?

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.359
That's a lot.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.399
This is
honky-tonk bullshit.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.370
You just like having me
around, don't you, Mildred?

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.726
My hat.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.245
You went off and found it?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.924
I guess I could've bought
you flowers once or twice.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.925
I like violets.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.559
She "billy goat-ed" me.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.688
It's something we used to do.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.641
Why she covers up them ankles
with them damn white boots

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.599
I'll never understand.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.279
Fifty-three more years, huh?

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.568
Well, I still got
some things to work on.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.126
Hell, this is the third time
I've been extended.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.331
Oh, say, I got you something.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.801
What's this?

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.799
I knew you weren't happy
with Grandpa Chen,

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.646
so I pulled a few strings,
got you some new ID.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.609
Thank you. Thank you, Roy.
I mean that.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.326
This is great.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.450
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.843
I did what I could.
Inventory is what it is.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.407
You thought this was an improvement?
