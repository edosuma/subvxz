01:32.000 --> 01:36.995
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It’s beautiful!

01:37.172 --> 01:40.510
It reminds me
of a quote from Socrates:

01:40.676 --> 01:44.848
"If measure and symmetry are absent
from any composition. -

01:45.015 --> 01:49.270
- The ruin awaits both the
ingredients and the composition."

01:49.436 --> 01:54.568
"Measure and symmetry are beauty
and virtue the world over."

02:00.365 --> 02:05.664
- Do you think he’s straight?
- Yeah, he’s too boring to be gay.

02:06.497 --> 02:10.366
- Is it 5: 15?
- Yes, it is.

02:12.338 --> 02:15.257
Thank you...

02:15.424 --> 02:22.224
I'm releasing you a half hour early
today. I have... an appointment.

02:22.391 --> 02:27.438
I’m giving a lecture on my new book
tonight. You are all welcome.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.695
Thank you.

02:53.969 --> 02:59.558
Rose, get that mask off your face.
It’ll clog your pores.

02:59.725 --> 03:05.023
You’re going to be late.
It’s almost seven o’clock.

03:11.447 --> 03:16.202
You bum! Three million dollars
a year! For what?

03:16.369 --> 03:20.415
Come on.
Just one more out.

03:45.694 --> 03:49.532
- Barry Neufeld.
- Hi, it’s Rose.

03:49.699 --> 03:53.286
Hi... Not again.

03:53.453 --> 03:58.042
I think it’s an allergic reaction
to something I ate.

03:58.876 --> 04:03.506
- My throat’s starting to close up.
- It sounds like you’re dying.

04:03.673 --> 04:11.099
- Sure you’re not allergic to me?
- That’s a terrible thing to think!

04:11.265 --> 04:15.187
Every Manhattan restaurant hates me
for not keeping reservations.

04:15.353 --> 04:20.233
Why don’t you call me next week?
If you still want to.

04:20.399 --> 04:25.197
- Feel better.
- Thank you. Bye.

04:41.675 --> 04:47.765
- Should I start with a joke?
- No, there’s not enough time.

04:47.932 --> 04:51.978
- For what?
- To develop a sense of humor.

04:53.063 --> 04:58.569
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the author of "Absolute Truth". -

04:58.736 --> 05:02.574
- Columbia’s very own
Professor Gregory Larkin.

05:02.741 --> 05:05.870
You’re going to be fine.

05:10.833 --> 05:16.955
Thank you. I’m honored by this
warm and gracious welcome.

05:17.132 --> 05:22.805
Being here, at the end of a journey,
I’m reminded of Descartes" words:

05:22.972 --> 05:30.064
"Whether I am awake or asleep, two
and three will always make five."

05:30.230 --> 05:36.738
"It does not seem possible that
such a truth can be questioned."

05:36.904 --> 05:44.163
This book has taken me
over 14 years to write.

05:44.330 --> 05:50.535
It is with sadness I say goodbye
to it consuming my days and nights.

05:52.547 --> 05:55.593
And nights...

05:59.556 --> 06:03.425
And as I stand here...

06:05.145 --> 06:08.732
In coming up...
summing up...

06:11.610 --> 06:14.781
Excuse me,
I’m feeling a little dizzy.

06:17.951 --> 06:23.791
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I'd know more. I don’t.

06:23.958 --> 06:27.171
I don’t know anything, really.

06:28.296 --> 06:33.052
Thank you all for coming.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.646
What did I say?

06:41.812 --> 06:46.724
It was fine, though you shouldn’t
work for a suicide hotline.

06:46.901 --> 06:54.117
- You did fine until Candice came.
- Don’t start. I just forgot to eat.

06:54.284 --> 06:58.623
It’s natural. She left you what,
a year ago?

06:58.790 --> 07:05.245
Thank God Candy left when she did,
or I’d never have finished the book.

07:05.423 --> 07:10.334
You’re a guy who can’t have sex
and chew gum at the same time.

07:10.511 --> 07:16.477
When I’m with someone, I tend
to get a little sidetracked.

07:16.643 --> 07:22.317
- 14 years? Is that sidetracked?
- I bet she’s still out there.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.653
If I know Candice, she’s out there.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.733
She’s out there.
Face her like a grown-up.

07:31.911 --> 07:38.585
- Don’t let me go home with her.
- It would be odd not to invite...

07:38.752 --> 07:42.756
Just don’t let me go home with her.

07:44.884 --> 07:48.221
Are you all right?

07:48.388 --> 07:54.760
- It was the stupid wine. Hello.
- You look great.

07:54.937 --> 08:00.569
I hope you don’t mind me showing up
like this on your big night.

08:00.736 --> 08:05.731
It’s just that I've been
thinking so much about you lately.

08:06.868 --> 08:10.736
- Do you want to go get a drink?
- I’d better not.

08:10.914 --> 08:14.668
- A bite to eat?
- No, I’m not hungry.

08:14.835 --> 08:18.704
- Do you want me to take you home?
- Okay.

08:18.881 --> 08:23.428
- Good to see you, Henry.
- But Greg...

08:26.223 --> 08:32.188
- Don’t leave. Aren’t you staying?
- Well, we’re done.

08:32.355 --> 08:37.236
- I still have feelings for you.
- But I dumped you for another man.

08:37.402 --> 08:42.313
- And I'm still sort of with Paul.
- I thought that was over.

08:42.491 --> 08:47.080
He cheated. I wanted to feel better
about myself before I see him.

08:47.247 --> 08:52.211
- That’s why you’re here?
- Well, yeah.

08:52.378 --> 08:57.341
You were always a nice guy.
But let’s face it. -

08:57.508 --> 09:02.098
- We’ve nothing in common except
sex, and the fact you idolize me.

09:02.264 --> 09:06.686
I really do care for you.

09:06.853 --> 09:11.608
- I just can’t wind up with you.
- Can I call you sometime?

09:12.985 --> 09:17.156
What for?

09:22.328 --> 09:26.542
- Are you going?
- No, I cancelled.

09:26.708 --> 09:31.505
What do you want to do for dinner?
Make that pasta with artichokes.

09:31.672 --> 09:37.596
Later we can figure out what to do
with your hair for Claire’s wedding.

09:42.685 --> 09:45.939
What is this?

09:46.105 --> 09:49.193
Look at that.

09:50.194 --> 09:54.448
The mating ritual
is both speedy and violent.

09:54.615 --> 09:59.162
The lesser male often covers
the larger female.

09:59.329 --> 10:05.669
If unsuccessful in mounting, the
male is often eaten by the female.

10:06.796 --> 10:11.426
We're the girls of 1-400 Hot Talk.

10:11.593 --> 10:16.724
Briana, Tina, Marla
and me: Felicia.

10:16.891 --> 10:23.857
Anything you want to talk about,
call me...

10:26.568 --> 10:33.911
- I don’t know where to begin.
- Are you lonely tonight, darling?

10:34.786 --> 10:40.418
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.

10:40.585 --> 10:45.257
- Can I ask you a question?
- I'm just wearing a towel.

10:45.423 --> 10:50.555
I was drying myself off,
after a hot shower...

10:50.722 --> 10:53.516
Why do women leave?

10:53.683 --> 10:59.732
Why do they leave? Especially
pretty ones. I can’t do it any more.

10:59.898 --> 11:07.532
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.

11:07.699 --> 11:12.288
The mathematical world
is completely rational.

11:12.454 --> 11:17.210
You think too much. Don’t you want
to know how big my tits are?

11:17.376 --> 11:22.340
No! I just want to share my life
with someone.

11:22.508 --> 11:27.013
Someone
I'm not sexually attracted to.

11:27.180 --> 11:34.062
How can two people come together
in lasting respect and affection?

11:34.229 --> 11:39.986
- The world’s run by sex ads.
- Take out your own ad, I guess.

11:40.153 --> 11:43.281
An ad?

12:16.277 --> 12:20.824
Look at me. I'm a grown woman
wearing a prom dress.

12:20.991 --> 12:26.331
I look like an over-the-hill
Barbie doll. And it’s too tight.

12:26.497 --> 12:32.869
- I want something in my colour.
- Maids of honour don’t wear black.

12:33.047 --> 12:38.260
- Why aren’t you wearing make-up?
- I am wearing make-up.

12:38.427 --> 12:45.268
- You’d look good with a perm.
- Like Shirley Temple on crack.

12:45.436 --> 12:53.236
Where is she? She can’t stand that
I'm getting all the attention.

12:53.403 --> 13:00.286
- We should’ve had her committed.
- For excessive vanity?

13:00.453 --> 13:06.794
How wonderful! Two compassionate
daughters. No make-up today?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.536
I am wearing make-up.

13:11.007 --> 13:15.512
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It’s an imitation Scassi.

13:15.679 --> 13:20.058
- You’re my mother, not the singer.
- I'll go home and change.

13:20.225 --> 13:23.562
Stop it. We’re late.
The priest is sweating.

13:23.730 --> 13:27.817
All celibates sweat, dear.
If they didn’t, they’d explode.

13:27.984 --> 13:33.657
I bought a snack. If I sit through
this without eating, I'll pass out.

13:33.824 --> 13:37.120
It’ll only take 45 minutes.

13:37.286 --> 13:40.540
Marrying outside your faith,
and on the Sabbath...

13:40.707 --> 13:46.505
All I know about the Sabbath is that
Bergdorf’s isn’t too crowded.

13:46.672 --> 13:50.374
I want you to remember,
today is my day.

13:50.551 --> 13:55.599
Behave, or I'll blow up your birth
certificate into a Christmas card.

13:55.766 --> 14:00.313
I should have never
encouraged you to speak.

14:09.907 --> 14:13.911
Maybe she’ll look back
and turn into a pillar of salt.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.337
Alex looks nervous.

14:21.504 --> 14:27.844
- I hope I'm doing the right thing.
- I think you are.

14:29.470 --> 14:35.060
The party is about to get started.
The dance floor is all yours!

14:35.728 --> 14:41.193
Okay girls, lick your lips.

14:42.861 --> 14:45.614
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.

14:45.781 --> 14:49.567
Your husband’s a lucky guy.

14:50.954 --> 14:56.668
- Waiter! Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.

14:56.835 --> 15:02.926
- Two more drinks, when you can.
- This looks delicious.

15:07.848 --> 15:12.019
- I can’t believe he’s married.
- And that he chose Claire over you.

15:12.187 --> 15:18.193
- I told you not to introduce them.
- She was married, I didn’t think.

15:19.528 --> 15:25.368
- How are you handling all this?
- No more fantasies of handsome men.

15:25.535 --> 15:30.582
- There’s a guy out there somewhere.
- Who? Barry Neufeldt?

15:30.749 --> 15:37.966
What’s wrong with him, other than
that he looks like Gumpy?

15:38.133 --> 15:41.261
Gumby, not Gumpy.

15:43.722 --> 15:49.646
- I'm no great prize, either.
- You’re a great person and teacher.

15:49.812 --> 15:55.194
I think I've reached the point where
you know you’ll never get married.

15:55.361 --> 16:02.702
Married? What’s marriage? A ring,
a contract. Fighting, compromising.

16:02.869 --> 16:09.836
It can be more than that. You know
what I envy about people in love?

16:10.003 --> 16:15.550
I'd love it
if someone really knew me.

16:15.717 --> 16:21.838
What I like. What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.

16:22.559 --> 16:26.730
I think
that would really be wonderful.

16:26.897 --> 16:33.154
Hey, sister-in-law,
having a good time?

16:34.322 --> 16:39.912
- Have you seen Claire?
- No, I'll find her for you.

16:40.078 --> 16:44.990
You look beautiful tonight. I'm not
just saying that. You really do.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.576
I heard you.

16:47.753 --> 16:53.510
Why don’t you have some coffee?
I'll find Claire.

16:55.387 --> 17:01.645
- Alex is looking for you.
- Brother, it’s starting already?

17:01.811 --> 17:05.597
How could you do this?
I'll never forgive you.

17:57.958 --> 18:02.130
- Yes. .!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.

18:02.297 --> 18:08.012
I'm calling about the response to
my ad. Is this Professor Morgan?

18:08.179 --> 18:14.352
- I'm her sister. She knows nothing.
- Then maybe we shouldn’t talk.

18:14.519 --> 18:21.778
No! Rose would never answer herself.
Most of these guys are creeps.

18:21.945 --> 18:27.617
But when it said you taught
at Columbia, something just clicked.

18:27.784 --> 18:31.830
- You have seen her picture, right?
- Yes.

18:31.997 --> 18:35.835
- And. .?
- And what?

18:37.129 --> 18:39.340
Nothing. Great.

18:48.725 --> 18:51.812
Make way, please.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.035
This is the scene
at my sister’s wedding.

19:05.202 --> 19:10.917
She’s getting drunk, regretting that
she got married for the third time.

19:11.084 --> 19:16.841
My mom’s sprouting snakes from her
hair in jealousy. It was perfect...

19:17.008 --> 19:23.182
We’ve got three feminine archetypes:
The divine whore, Medusa -

19:23.348 --> 19:27.102
- And me. What archetype am I?

19:27.269 --> 19:32.734
- The Virgin Mary?
- Thanks a lot, Trevor.

19:32.900 --> 19:39.523
No, the faithful handmaiden. Always
the bridesmaid, never the bride.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.620
It proves what Jung said all along.

19:42.787 --> 19:48.032
Myths and archetypes are alive
and well and living in my apartment.

19:48.836 --> 19:55.009
As I stood beside the altar beside
my sister and her husband to be. -

19:55.176 --> 19:59.848
- It struck me that this ritual,
a wedding ceremony. -

20:00.015 --> 20:04.812
- Is the last scene of a fairy tale.
They never say what happens after.

20:04.979 --> 20:13.697
That Cinderella drove the prince mad
by obsessively cleaning the castle.

20:13.864 --> 20:18.495
They don’t say what happens after
because there is no after.

20:18.662 --> 20:23.333
The be-all and end-all
of romantic love was... Mike?

20:23.500 --> 20:28.662
- Sex?
- You have sex on the brain.

20:28.839 --> 20:32.844
- Marriage.
- But it wasn’t always like that.

20:33.011 --> 20:40.061
The 12th century had "courtly love",
which had nothing to do with sex.

20:40.228 --> 20:47.777
The relationship between a knight
and a married lady of the court...

20:47.944 --> 20:51.157
And so they could never
consummate their love.

20:51.323 --> 20:59.291
They rose above "going to the toilet
in front of each other" love. -

20:59.458 --> 21:05.298
- And went after
something more divine.

21:05.465 --> 21:11.889
They took sex out of the equation,
leaving them with a union of souls.

21:12.056 --> 21:17.217
Think of this. Sex was always
the fatal love potion.

21:17.395 --> 21:20.315
Look at the literature of the time.

21:20.482 --> 21:26.405
All consummation could lead to was
madness, despair or death.

21:26.572 --> 21:31.734
Experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther
are united in one belief:

21:31.911 --> 21:38.085
True love has spiritual dimensions,
while romantic love is a lie.

21:38.252 --> 21:45.176
A myth. A soulless manipulation.
And speaking of manipulation...

21:45.343 --> 21:50.224
It’s like going to the movies
and seeing the lovers kiss...

21:50.391 --> 21:54.145
The music swells,
and we buy it, right?

21:54.312 --> 22:00.402
So when my date kisses me, and I
don’t hear strings, I dump him.

22:02.279 --> 22:06.451
The question is,
why do we buy it?

22:06.617 --> 22:12.207
Because, myth or manipulation,
we all want to fall in love.

22:13.333 --> 22:18.162
That experience makes us feel
completely alive.

22:18.340 --> 22:25.806
Our everyday reality is shattered,
and we are flung into the heavens.

22:25.973 --> 22:31.563
It may only last a moment, an hour,
but that doesn’t diminish its value.

22:31.730 --> 22:35.776
We’re left with memories we
treasure for the rest of our lives.

22:35.943 --> 22:42.565
I read, "When we fall in love,
we hear Puccini in our heads."

22:42.742 --> 22:51.868
I love that. His music expresses our
need for passion and romantic love.

22:52.045 --> 22:57.207
We listen to La Boheme or Turandot,
or read Wuthering Heights. -

22:57.384 --> 23:02.682
- Or watch Casablanca, and a little
of that love lives in us too.

23:02.849 --> 23:08.480
So the final question is:
Why do people want to fall in love -

23:08.646 --> 23:13.319
- When it can have such a short run
and be so painful?

23:13.486 --> 23:19.691
- Propagation of the species?
- We need to connect with somebody.

23:19.868 --> 23:25.990
- Are we culturally preconditioned?
- Good, but too intellectual for me.

23:26.167 --> 23:31.079
I think it’s because,
as some of you may already know...

23:31.256 --> 23:36.679
While it does last,
it feels fucking great.

23:58.204 --> 24:02.042
I'm almost finished,
and you haven’t started yet.

24:02.208 --> 24:06.338
The perfect bite.

24:12.052 --> 24:15.348
You need a therapist.

24:18.476 --> 24:23.106
Do we have to have the TV on?
Can’t we have a conversation?

24:23.274 --> 24:27.446
I'm not intellectually stimulating,
like your university people...

24:27.612 --> 24:30.824
I'm sorry. How was your day, Mother?

24:30.991 --> 24:36.205
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry. Let’s talk.

24:37.581 --> 24:41.117
I've lived too long.
I should be dead.

24:41.294 --> 24:44.830
Give me that! Talk to me already!

24:46.801 --> 24:52.640
All right. You haven’t even noticed
I had my hair done differently.

24:54.059 --> 24:59.022
I thought you looked different.
It looks great.

25:00.233 --> 25:07.365
- What’s different about it?
- The...

25:07.532 --> 25:13.956
Nothing. You’re just like
your father. So easy to trip up.

25:18.211 --> 25:23.968
- So, how was work?
- Same as always.

25:24.135 --> 25:28.963
Though I had one customer in
for a make-over. She needed one.

25:29.141 --> 25:34.772
Dyed blonde hair. Blue eye shadow.
Ash-brown foundation. Hideous.

25:34.939 --> 25:40.237
- She was shocked over my age.
- How old were you?

25:44.408 --> 25:46.817
Sorry.

25:46.994 --> 25:52.417
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.

25:52.584 --> 25:57.413
He invited me to an Alzheimer’s
benefit. I said forget it.

25:57.590 --> 26:03.388
I can’t believe he still asks you.
Why don’t you go with him sometime?

26:03.555 --> 26:08.383
No... I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband. That’s my life.

26:08.561 --> 26:13.608
I don’t want to start another.
And he knows my situation with you.

26:16.695 --> 26:19.740
You won’t see him because of me?

26:19.906 --> 26:25.997
How would it look? The mother’s
dating and the daughter stays home?

26:26.164 --> 26:28.792
Who’s looking?

26:29.334 --> 26:33.172
Hello... Hi.

26:34.256 --> 26:38.636
Hello, this is...

26:38.803 --> 26:42.308
Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin.

26:43.141 --> 26:46.677
Professor Gregory Larkin.

26:53.445 --> 26:58.441
Answer the phone. I'm sleeping.

26:58.618 --> 27:02.831
Is Professor Larkin there?
I mean, is Professor Morgan there?

27:02.998 --> 27:08.379
- Barely. Who’s this?
- Gregory Larkin.

27:08.545 --> 27:14.803
I'm a professor
in the math department at Columbia.

27:14.969 --> 27:17.640
I was just calling to see...

27:19.224 --> 27:26.608
- How are you tonight?
- I'm fine. How are you?

27:28.068 --> 27:31.520
Fine.

27:38.663 --> 27:44.253
I hope it wasn't presumptuous
of me, but I went to your class -

27:44.420 --> 27:49.583
- And was very impressed. I hoped
we could eat dinner Saturday.

27:51.553 --> 27:54.765
- Louder!
- I sat in on your class.

27:54.932 --> 27:59.843
- Hold on. Don’t go away.
- I was impressed by your teaching.

28:00.021 --> 28:04.234
I was hoping
we could have dinner Saturday.

28:05.652 --> 28:08.823
I can do this!

28:08.990 --> 28:13.078
Can you hear me?

28:13.245 --> 28:20.670
- Okay... You want to eat dinner.
- I sat in on your class.

28:20.836 --> 28:26.760
- Who’s on the phone?
- Quiet! No, not you.

28:26.927 --> 28:31.348
Gregory Larkin.
Math department. Columbia.

29:13.647 --> 29:19.028
- I saw you pass by.
- I was just passing by...

29:19.195 --> 29:25.452
- I'm sorry about calling...
- I was so confused.

29:26.453 --> 29:30.958
- Are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.

29:31.125 --> 29:34.577
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Moi aussi.

29:43.097 --> 29:47.477
He must be good-looking,
for you to go to all this trouble.

29:47.644 --> 29:51.982
- I hate lipstick.
- Did you try the samples I brought?

29:52.149 --> 29:55.851
- I'm not going.
- Oh, what do you want for dinner?

29:56.029 --> 29:59.814
I don’t care. I'm upset.
Can’t you see that?

29:59.992 --> 30:05.039
- You always cancel your dates.
- This is not a date.

30:05.205 --> 30:08.658
Then why does it matter how you look
with this one?

30:08.835 --> 30:14.884
Stop calling him "this one".
And nothing’s going to happen.

30:15.050 --> 30:20.348
You need more colour.
Let me do it.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.894
- Don’t make me look like a clown.
- You won’t look like a clown.

30:24.060 --> 30:28.232
- Where’s the hairpiece?
- Shall I make you something to eat?

30:28.399 --> 30:32.612
Make him wait. He mustn’t think he’s
the only date you’ve had in years.

30:32.779 --> 30:35.156
Where’s the bow?

30:36.575 --> 30:42.665
Hey, your mother did you up again.
Looks great! Can I get you a cab?

30:54.804 --> 30:58.391
Sorry.

31:03.731 --> 31:09.278
Are you sure?
You’re going to take me?

31:09.445 --> 31:13.951
Here’s where I'm going, but don’t go
until I put up the window.

31:14.118 --> 31:17.987
- They’re broke, lady.
- My hair!

31:18.164 --> 31:23.378
Don’t complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.

31:35.809 --> 31:41.483
- I'm sorry.
- For what? You’re exactly on time.

31:41.650 --> 31:47.656
My hair. I must look like
I was attacked by wolves.

31:47.823 --> 31:52.651
I didn’t even notice.

31:53.996 --> 31:58.752
Could you excuse me while I go
to the ladies" room for a minute?

32:04.175 --> 32:07.262
Do you enjoy dancing?

32:07.429 --> 32:11.892
I used to love to dance
with my father. You?

32:12.059 --> 32:18.775
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.

32:20.193 --> 32:23.572
- Watching?
- Pairs...

32:23.738 --> 32:28.536
It’s interesting how coupling
appears in nature and mathematics.

32:28.703 --> 32:33.834
- You were talking about pairs...
- Oh, the twin-prime conjecture.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.882
It explores pairs of prime numbers.
Those only divisible by themselves.

32:40.049 --> 32:44.846
Three-five. Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...

32:45.013 --> 32:51.218
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That’s right.

32:51.395 --> 32:55.775
11-13 and 17-19 and so on.

32:55.943 --> 33:01.240
It was discovered that pairs
were often separated by...

33:01.407 --> 33:09.239
- One number in between.
- Exactly. Did you read my book?

33:09.416 --> 33:14.713
- No, I'm sorry.
- That’s okay. This is marvellous.

33:14.880 --> 33:20.178
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn’t mean to lecture.

33:20.345 --> 33:24.266
I'm sorry,
I didn’t mean to call it a date.

33:24.433 --> 33:29.647
It’s just rare that I meet a person
I can discuss these things with.

33:29.814 --> 33:34.487
- Some pepper?
- No, not for me.

33:34.653 --> 33:40.326
Could you bring me a side dish
of extra dressing?

33:40.493 --> 33:45.624
I don’t particularly like salad,
I just like the dressing.

33:45.791 --> 33:53.592
Interesting theory. Are there still
pairs like that past a million?

33:55.594 --> 34:04.719
I can’t believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.

34:04.896 --> 34:10.945
I have concert tickets next
Saturday. Can we do this again?

34:12.487 --> 34:16.534
- Sure.
- Great. Terrific.

34:18.119 --> 34:24.460
What was it you wanted to discuss
about my teaching?

34:25.837 --> 34:30.998
I have to confess. That was
just an excuse to meet you.

34:31.176 --> 34:34.472
I hope you don’t mind.

34:34.638 --> 34:40.353
I found it interesting. I have many
questions, the first of which is:

34:41.728 --> 34:44.400
How do you get them to stay?

34:49.072 --> 34:51.824
Well?

34:53.452 --> 34:59.208
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?

34:59.375 --> 35:02.378
Don’t ask.

35:02.545 --> 35:07.217
- You won’t be seeing him again?
- We’re going out next week.

35:07.384 --> 35:10.888
So, he must like you.

35:13.307 --> 35:16.561
Did he kiss you?

35:17.270 --> 35:19.596
No.

35:20.691 --> 35:24.028
That’s kind of sweet, actually.

35:40.922 --> 35:44.708
Hi.
This is Cindy.

35:52.352 --> 35:55.397
This is a spectrum analyzer.

35:55.564 --> 36:01.112
It makes graphic representations
of the music. Watch.

36:03.865 --> 36:08.829
- Who’s the girl?
- Rose Morgan.

36:08.996 --> 36:13.992
Henry Fine is a professor
in anthropology.

36:16.129 --> 36:20.926
Beautiful music, isn’t it?
Beautiful atmosphere.

36:39.239 --> 36:46.247
I enjoyed that.
Thank you so much for inviting me.

36:46.414 --> 36:53.171
Why don’t you come up? I'd like
to give you a copy of my book.

36:53.338 --> 37:00.096
I'd love that. Your book, I mean.
Not to come up to your apartment.

37:00.262 --> 37:04.100
But Rose, I'm inviting you.

37:04.267 --> 37:09.513
If you like this kind of music,
I have some wonderful CD's, but...

37:09.690 --> 37:13.393
...they’re also in my apartment.

37:13.570 --> 37:19.942
I have to be honest with you.
I'm a bit out of practice with this.

37:20.119 --> 37:24.457
I want you to feel comfortable.
That’s important to me.

37:24.624 --> 37:30.005
I want to tell you upfront.
I'm not interested in sex.

37:30.172 --> 37:34.886
- You’re not?
- And it has nothing to do with you.

37:35.053 --> 37:40.298
It has to do with what you were
talking about in your class.

37:40.475 --> 37:46.065
I, too, believe it’s illusions about
love and the emphasis on sex -

37:46.232 --> 37:52.739
- That separate people today.
As you said, romance is a myth.

37:52.906 --> 37:56.744
I was referring to academic opinions
that are purely subjective.

37:56.911 --> 38:05.212
You were right! Relationships based
on romantic love are worthless.

38:05.379 --> 38:08.007
Did you stay for my whole class?

38:08.173 --> 38:14.514
I left when you mentioned the music
we hear when lovers kiss in films.

38:14.681 --> 38:20.688
It is manipulative! In real life,
we don’t hear music when we kiss.

38:20.855 --> 38:24.984
And the person you’re with isn’t a
movie star. It’s a malicious...

38:25.151 --> 38:30.064
Fantasy? Is it all right
if I sit down for a minute?

38:30.241 --> 38:38.208
The addiction to beauty and
perfection created by advertising -

38:38.375 --> 38:44.715
- Feeds on people’s pathetic hopes.
They don’t have their own opinions.

38:44.883 --> 38:48.136
The media tells us what’s beautiful.

38:48.303 --> 38:53.382
TV shows tell us what a relationship
is supposed to be like. And sex!

38:53.559 --> 38:58.064
I don’t even want to tell you
how that’s ruined my life...

38:58.231 --> 39:01.276
Well, I go crazy.

39:01.443 --> 39:05.906
When I want someone sexually,
I go out of my mind.

39:06.074 --> 39:10.537
Do you remember that film
where the woman kills the bunny?

39:10.704 --> 39:15.042
- "Fatal Attraction"?
- Granted, it was a film.

39:15.209 --> 39:20.756
But I understand how she felt.
Not that I would kill an animal. -

39:20.924 --> 39:27.463
- But I know the feeling of wanting
someone so much that it hurts.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.020
This fiction, known as love,
drives people crazy, as you said.

39:33.187 --> 39:38.100
- Then you’re either mad, alone...
- Or dead. But that was fiction.

39:38.277 --> 39:41.113
Right! We’re dead!

39:41.280 --> 39:48.246
I do believe two people can
come together, even marry. -

39:48.413 --> 39:52.251
- For reasons
more concrete than sex.

39:52.417 --> 39:59.468
A love that grows out of respect,
love, trust, common interest.

39:59.635 --> 40:04.796
Have you noticed that friendships
last longer than marriages?

40:04.973 --> 40:10.897
The 12th century was on to
something. Would you like coffee?

40:12.733 --> 40:18.155
- Got any scotch?
- Yeah.

40:18.322 --> 40:23.537
Are you busy this week? I was hoping
you could help me with my teaching.

40:23.703 --> 40:26.916
You give yourself too little credit.

40:27.083 --> 40:30.867
Maybe you could sit in
on one of my classes.

40:31.045 --> 40:35.717
If X squared plus Y squared
equals 16. -

40:35.884 --> 40:39.972
- How do we find DYIDX
as an implicit function of X and Y?

40:40.139 --> 40:44.769
Well, Y is a function of X...

40:49.191 --> 40:56.940
You walk across the room like this,
and you’re into your own thing.

40:57.117 --> 41:03.916
Your body language is very detached,
very alienating.

41:04.083 --> 41:08.546
I think you have to relate more
to the kids.

41:08.713 --> 41:13.468
You’re up there with your back to
the room, solving your own problems.

41:13.635 --> 41:19.392
It’s like you’re having a math
party, and only invited yourself.

41:19.559 --> 41:26.358
- Relax. Loosen up. Have some fun.
- Relax. Have fun... What else?

41:26.526 --> 41:31.990
Loosen up. Put the pen down,
I'm not going to test you on this.

41:32.156 --> 41:35.775
Come on. Teach me something.

41:36.912 --> 41:44.170
If a ball is thrown up into the air,
and its height, H, equals 100 T...

41:44.337 --> 41:48.842
What are you doing?
Turn around. Talk to me.

41:51.345 --> 41:55.725
If T is time in seconds,
at what limit is the speed...

41:55.892 --> 42:01.315
You lost me.
You have to put it in context.

42:01.482 --> 42:05.737
- Jazz it up, put some humor in it.
- Humor in calculus?

42:06.988 --> 42:12.536
- Well, try telling a story.
- A story?

42:12.703 --> 42:16.999
Once upon a time...

42:18.960 --> 42:21.922
...there was a ball.

42:23.298 --> 42:26.917
It was thrown into the air.

42:30.974 --> 42:36.188
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.

42:36.354 --> 42:40.860
No one understands those, either.
Just kidding.

42:41.027 --> 42:47.743
- Don’t give up. Try it again.
- Tell you another story?

42:47.910 --> 42:52.457
Hi, Professor Larkin... Sorry.

42:52.623 --> 42:55.460
That’s all right.

42:55.626 --> 43:01.008
- Do we have an appointment?
- Actually, I wanted to make one.

43:05.263 --> 43:11.802
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?

43:15.400 --> 43:21.855
- My head is swimming. It’s hot.
- Put your head between your legs.

43:25.035 --> 43:28.487
Pretty girl.

43:28.665 --> 43:33.170
With all that make-up?
You don’t wear any, do you?

43:33.336 --> 43:36.382
I'd still look like me,
only in colour.

43:36.549 --> 43:41.971
You’re too smart for that. You’re
a confident, no-nonsense woman.

43:42.138 --> 43:46.894
- I sound like an airline.
- I'm probably saying it wrong.

43:47.061 --> 43:50.106
It’s just that
you don’t need any of that.

43:52.650 --> 43:56.519
Thanks.
How’s your head?

43:58.240 --> 44:05.039
- I think food will help you.
- Pizza, maybe?

44:07.334 --> 44:11.755
Where can we go? Dancing?
Why did I say that?

44:11.922 --> 44:16.720
There’s that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.

44:16.887 --> 44:21.684
My mother would kill me.
What is that, Danish?

44:21.850 --> 44:24.770
This is the one.

44:24.937 --> 44:30.402
Trees are fascinating. They don’t
have to touch to propagate.

44:30.569 --> 44:33.280
You would find that fascinating...

44:33.446 --> 44:37.660
- How many do I need?
- One, two, three, four...

44:37.826 --> 44:41.529
Why didn’t I see that?

44:41.706 --> 44:46.587
- Thank you. I owe you one.
- It’s right in front of your eyes.

44:51.843 --> 44:56.348
Six and a five.
I got you.

44:56.515 --> 45:02.605
The pretzel! You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.

45:02.772 --> 45:09.112
I'm going to take my theory of love
as a man-made cultural creation -

45:09.279 --> 45:15.078
- And expand it to include the
biological effect on the individual.

45:15.245 --> 45:18.582
You need a hobby.

45:22.837 --> 45:24.338
I can’t believe you’ve dated
for three months and haven’t kissed!

45:24.338 --> 45:27.957
I can’t believe you’ve dated
for three months and haven’t kissed!

45:28.134 --> 45:33.098
- How do you say hello?
- Well, we nod. It works.

45:33.266 --> 45:39.313
- You mean you haven’t even touched?
- I fell once, and he picked me up.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.932
We talk a lot. That’s what we do.

45:43.110 --> 45:47.281
And I don’t worry about what I say,
what I wear, what I eat...

45:47.448 --> 45:52.788
It’s a relief to eat with a man, and
not worry that he’ll be frightened.

45:52.955 --> 45:58.795
He’s fun to be with. Maybe "fun"
isn’t the word. He’s interesting.

45:58.962 --> 46:04.300
How many men can you say that about?
Is a tie too personal a gift?

46:04.467 --> 46:08.170
Are you using it
on something other than his neck?

46:08.347 --> 46:13.937
Does he look good in vests? Why do
you want him to meet your mother?

46:14.104 --> 46:19.443
I kept saying I was a great cook,
so I offered him a birthday dinner.

46:19.609 --> 46:25.981
Now I need something nice. After
meeting her, I won’t see him again.

46:27.118 --> 46:33.574
- I'm starving. Can we eat?
- I can’t, I have a date.

46:33.751 --> 46:39.873
- Find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
- Who? We should get you some blush.

46:40.383 --> 46:44.763
- I'm hungry, Claire.
- Fruit.

46:44.930 --> 46:47.339
Why are you so grumpy?

46:47.516 --> 46:52.762
If he wasn’t gorgeous, rich and
straight, I wouldn’t have bothered.

46:52.939 --> 46:57.570
I'm sick to death of the man
I am bound to for eternity.

46:57.736 --> 47:00.949
Why are you saying that?

47:01.116 --> 47:05.120
No matter where I go, what I do,
there he is.

47:05.287 --> 47:08.207
In the kitchen,
on the phone, on my finger.

47:08.373 --> 47:13.203
I was asleep the other night.
When I wake up, he’s staring at me.

47:13.380 --> 47:18.625
- I think that’s sweet.
- I think it’s strange.

47:18.802 --> 47:22.223
Do you know
how weird that makes me feel?

47:22.390 --> 47:27.437
A lesbian dream, and he’s staring
at me like I should include him.

47:27.604 --> 47:30.816
I can’t even fantasize in private.

47:36.072 --> 47:42.694
Mom said you’ve been seeing
someone steady. Is he cute?

47:44.707 --> 47:50.046
- What?
- What are you doing here?

47:50.213 --> 47:56.012
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?

47:57.596 --> 48:02.352
Excuse me. I'm going
to the ladies" room. Alone.

48:07.358 --> 48:13.563
Can you believe this weather? It's
almost April and it’s still cold.

48:14.574 --> 48:18.870
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?

48:19.037 --> 48:22.083
It’ll sound strange, but...

48:23.084 --> 48:29.205
Is Claire happy?
I mean, do you think she’s happy?

48:29.383 --> 48:35.014
Yes, I think she is.
Why?

48:35.181 --> 48:39.134
I'm being silly.
I'm a first-time husband.

48:39.311 --> 48:44.389
If she doesn’t wake up
and tell me she’s ecstatic, I worry.

48:47.779 --> 48:55.078
Imagine, I have you to thank
for the fact that we’re married.

48:55.245 --> 49:02.337
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.

49:02.504 --> 49:08.010
- Don’t do that.
- What? What am I doing?

49:10.513 --> 49:13.808
You don’t even know, do you?

49:15.727 --> 49:19.065
Rose...

49:19.232 --> 49:25.071
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
- Rose, I'm sorry.

49:29.242 --> 49:36.043
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this. It’s so stupid.

49:36.209 --> 49:39.129
I must sound so pathetic.

49:39.296 --> 49:44.051
He asked if Claire was happy,
and I lied.

49:44.218 --> 49:49.214
- Isn’t that awful?
- Nothing criminal.

49:49.391 --> 49:55.513
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Are you feeling better now?

49:55.690 --> 49:58.099
A little.

49:58.276 --> 50:03.354
- You know, Rose, it takes time.
- Yeah, I know.

50:03.532 --> 50:11.082
I want you to know our friendship
really means a lot to me.

50:11.249 --> 50:15.337
I feel the same way,
which is why tonight...

50:15.504 --> 50:20.176
I better go home, I have to get
dinner ready. I'll see you at eight.

50:20.342 --> 50:24.890
Shall I bring anything
for your mother?

50:25.057 --> 50:29.312
Yeah, a wooden stake
and a crucifix.

50:32.023 --> 50:38.280
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It’s one of her idiosyncrasies.

50:38.447 --> 50:46.248
I came home late and threw this on.
God knows how I look.

50:51.211 --> 50:56.040
- I hope you like it.
- My God, Rose, it’s art!

50:56.217 --> 50:58.929
It’s not art.

50:59.096 --> 51:04.643
An artist isn’t only one who paints.
It’s one who sets the table. -

51:04.810 --> 51:11.098
- Prepares a meal, or teaches
in a certain way. You’re an artist.

51:11.276 --> 51:15.197
Why didn’t you use the Limoges?

51:15.364 --> 51:19.035
May I serve you?

51:19.202 --> 51:22.789
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.

51:22.956 --> 51:27.294
We go to all this trouble,
and Rose and I don’t eat very much.

51:28.295 --> 51:33.176
I've always thought
she had a very healthy appetite.

51:33.343 --> 51:38.474
I can’t stand women who eat
two bites and say they’re full.

51:40.351 --> 51:46.400
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.

51:47.902 --> 51:54.409
- Can I have some? And potatoes.
- You don’t need them.

51:54.576 --> 51:59.737
Have you ever sat in
on one of your daughter’s lectures?

51:59.915 --> 52:04.671
- Rose!
- That’s the best part.

52:10.969 --> 52:15.224
Rose tells me
you’ve never been married.

52:15.391 --> 52:17.800
That’s all right, Rose.

52:17.977 --> 52:26.154
That’s true, Mrs. Morgan. I guess
I haven’t found the right girl.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.867
I've had relationships that haven’t
worked out, but that will change.

52:31.034 --> 52:33.662
Really? Why?

52:33.828 --> 52:41.410
As I told Rose,
I have a theory about love...

52:41.588 --> 52:45.801
- And sex.
- Does anybody want coffee?

52:45.968 --> 52:50.264
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?

52:50.431 --> 52:55.311
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.

52:55.478 --> 53:00.943
Would you like cappuccinos?
Greg, why don’t you help me.

53:01.110 --> 53:06.240
- Why don’t you put the coffee on?
- I made dinner. You put it on.

53:06.408 --> 53:12.612
I've raised two daughters, buried
a husband, I've made my coffee.

53:19.256 --> 53:23.260
Alone at last.

53:23.427 --> 53:28.891
- I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.

53:30.352 --> 53:33.647
You’ve been seeing a lot
of my daughter.

53:33.813 --> 53:39.862
I hope you don’t mind my asking...
What are your intentions?

53:41.739 --> 53:45.608
My intentions?

53:48.830 --> 53:53.378
What a lovely meal!
You’re a good cook.

53:53.545 --> 53:58.175
- I didn’t oversell myself?
- Not at all, but the trouble...

53:58.342 --> 54:02.722
Of course I had to go to
the trouble. It was your birthday.

54:02.888 --> 54:09.427
What are friends for, but to give
each other presents and stuff...

54:09.604 --> 54:13.474
Happy birthday.

54:13.651 --> 54:19.074
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.

54:21.368 --> 54:24.705
- Dice?
- They once were dice.

54:24.872 --> 54:30.712
- Now they’re cuff links with...
- Prime numbers!

54:30.879 --> 54:36.802
- They’re great! How’d you do that?
- I had them made just for you.

54:36.969 --> 54:42.215
- They were done very fast.
- Thank you.

54:46.689 --> 54:50.140
Well...

54:50.317 --> 54:57.701
I've wanted to ask you something,
and I can only say this once...

54:57.743 --> 54:59.829
Sit down.

55:01.289 --> 55:07.493
We have a lot in common. Some
variables will remain unknown. -

55:07.671 --> 55:11.623
- As is the case
with most complex equations...

55:11.800 --> 55:18.005
- Greg, talk to me.
- I'm not saying this right.

55:19.935 --> 55:27.152
This feeling you have for Alex...
It won’t be the same with me.

55:27.319 --> 55:34.368
You won’t have that ache in your
stomach, because we’re not in love.

55:35.286 --> 55:39.373
I think we share
a genuine affection for each other.

55:39.541 --> 55:43.921
We share a passion for knowledge
rather than a physical passion.

55:44.088 --> 55:50.376
Although, if sex is something
that interests you. -

55:50.553 --> 55:55.976
- I'm sure I could provide that on
occasion, given enough warning.

55:56.143 --> 56:02.066
- What are you saying?
- We were in love and miserable.

56:02.233 --> 56:07.145
It’s a waste,
because as people, we’re valuable.

56:07.323 --> 56:14.581
When I look at you, I see a woman
unlike any other I've known before.

56:14.747 --> 56:21.171
Your mind, your humor, your passion
for ideas. I'm very fond of you.

56:21.338 --> 56:25.968
When I'm with you, I feel as if...

56:27.262 --> 56:30.140
...as if I'm home.

56:32.017 --> 56:35.855
So I think we should get married.

56:36.022 --> 56:41.695
People marry for sex or beauty. Are
my reasons more insane than those?

56:44.406 --> 56:51.831
Are you in shock, or just appalled?
Blink if you can hear me.

56:51.999 --> 56:55.210
Why are you laughing?

56:55.377 --> 57:03.293
I'm sorry. This sounds silly,
but I was just thinking...

57:03.470 --> 57:09.352
How could I marry someone
that I've never even...

57:11.854 --> 57:15.984
You know...

57:24.953 --> 57:28.082
...kissed.

57:28.248 --> 57:35.673
There’s one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn’t.

57:35.840 --> 57:41.763
You love Claire, too?
You just slept with her?

57:41.930 --> 57:45.799
- You want to?
- I don’t even know her.

57:45.977 --> 57:50.690
It’s about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...

57:50.857 --> 57:54.361
I think that’s kind of great.

57:54.528 --> 57:58.616
- I thought you’d be upset.
- Why? You picked me.

57:58.783 --> 58:06.667
Actually, I found you through this
charming woman on TV...

58:20.099 --> 58:22.935
Well, well, well...

58:26.314 --> 58:29.276
So?

58:30.236 --> 58:33.822
Gregory just proposed to me.

58:34.449 --> 58:37.452
Do you need a valium?

58:37.619 --> 58:43.740
I know you don’t respect my opinion,
but I don’t trust him.

58:43.918 --> 58:50.508
- I mean, where’s the attraction?
- He’s not attracted to me.

58:50.675 --> 58:54.628
He doesn’t want sex.
He wants to be companions.

58:55.640 --> 59:01.312
What sane person would agree to that
kind of marriage? It’s not natural.

59:01.479 --> 59:08.654
Are Claire and Alex natural?
He wants me, Mother!

59:08.821 --> 59:12.326
He wants you to cook and clean!

59:12.492 --> 59:18.613
- He found you through an ad.
- I already know, Mom. Sorry.

59:21.878 --> 59:27.426
It’s not your average proposal,
but let’s face it. -

59:27.593 --> 59:33.558
- They’re not standing in line
for me. And we like each other!

59:33.725 --> 59:37.729
Then say yes!
I can live alone.

59:37.896 --> 59:42.318
If you think such a marriage
is normal, then go ahead.

59:44.696 --> 59:52.443
Why do you do that? Why do you
make it sound so pathetic?

59:52.621 --> 01:00:00.536
You had a life. A husband who adored
you. Can’t I have some of that?

01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:07.169
I'm getting older, too.
Why can’t you be happy for me?

01:00:07.346 --> 01:00:10.850
But you can’t, can you?

01:00:11.017 --> 01:00:17.222
You’re scared to death of
being alone. And you’re jealous.

01:00:17.399 --> 01:00:24.616
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man. How ridiculous!

01:00:24.783 --> 01:00:31.666
Well, you know something, Mom?
A man does.

01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:53.691
Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose
Morgan have exchanged rings -

01:00:53.857 --> 01:00:57.810
- And agreed to recognize each other
as equals.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:02.451
They shall seek a life of
kindness and understanding.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:08.906
The ceremony of marriage
is a means of establishing a home.

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:13.380
And as you have exchanged vows
before witnesses. -

01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:22.266
- By the authority vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:28.888
- Congratulations! She’s a great...
- Yes. I've heard so much about you.

01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:34.195
- Likewise, about you.
- We all ought to...

01:01:34.362 --> 01:01:39.160
Had I known you were this handsome,
I'd have answered the ad myself.

01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:47.335
Congratulations. She’s the best. If
I were a man, I'd be all over her.

01:01:47.502 --> 01:01:54.260
Congratulations. I'm sure you’ll
both be very fascinating to watch.

01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:07.567
Rose, isn’t it amazing how many
books you accumulate over the years?

01:02:07.734 --> 01:02:13.491
- I know what you mean.
- I can’t believe it. And the dust!

01:02:13.657 --> 01:02:18.819
- This place needs a good cleaning.
- We’ll take care of that.

01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:25.796
I made room for your books.
Need any help?

01:02:25.963 --> 01:02:30.719
Everything’s put in its place.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:39.770
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.

01:02:40.897 --> 01:02:47.488
To sleep... In order to sleep.
You go to the bed for sleeping.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:54.235
- Do you want to do something else?
- What?

01:02:54.412 --> 01:03:00.169
- I wasn’t going to say anything.
- Do you want the bathroom first?

01:03:00.336 --> 01:03:06.050
- No, I can wait.
- No, you go. Please.

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:40.162
Your turn.

01:04:13.294 --> 01:04:16.130
- Tired?
- Not really.

01:04:16.297 --> 01:04:20.970
Me neither.
These are nice.

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:29.438
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure. I have some old movies.

01:04:31.773 --> 01:04:37.780
"It Happened One Night", "Lawrence
of Arabia", "Now, Voyager"?

01:04:37.947 --> 01:04:42.911
How about "Lawrence of Arabia"?
it’s nice and long.

01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:49.616
Okay. "Lawrence of Arabia" it is.

01:04:49.794 --> 01:04:53.246
Just stick it in.

01:05:23.624 --> 01:05:29.214
- Is it over?
- Yeah. Go to sleep.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:48.736
Are you just looking or buying?

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:55.358
- I'm not sure yet.
- So, it it seems to be going well.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:59.238
- Have you. .?
- No, and it’s made no difference.

01:05:59.415 --> 01:06:05.255
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?

01:06:05.422 --> 01:06:10.417
I was just telling Henry
how sex isn’t an issue for us.

01:06:10.594 --> 01:06:17.049
It’s much less complicated this way,
not to mention sanitary.

01:06:56.981 --> 01:07:04.896
It feels so good to be writing
again. I have so many ideas!

01:07:05.073 --> 01:07:09.787
It’s coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.

01:07:09.954 --> 01:07:16.211
What a terrific idea to come here.
I've never written in the park.

01:07:16.378 --> 01:07:19.799
Another one of these...

01:07:19.965 --> 01:07:25.127
Is that Barry?
I think it is.

01:07:25.889 --> 01:07:29.507
Barry...

01:07:29.684 --> 01:07:36.140
- Hi. It’s Rose.
- How are you? This is Gloria.

01:07:36.317 --> 01:07:41.448
- This is my husband, Gregory.
- Hi. This is Gloria.

01:07:41.615 --> 01:07:47.622
- You got married. Congratulations.
- Thank you. You look good, Barry.

01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:52.377
- Being engaged agrees with me.
- Congratulations!

01:07:52.544 --> 01:07:59.166
- Finally, one who doesn’t cancel.
- Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

01:08:02.973 --> 01:08:10.982
- I'm really happy for you both.
- Thank you, Rose. And take care.

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:44.854
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything’s okay.

01:08:51.403 --> 01:08:53.697
What?

01:08:53.863 --> 01:09:00.153
Jeans and a T-shirt is a good look
for you. Wear it to class sometime.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.921
- I'd love to get the scores.
- I'll read the paper.

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:11.634
Oh, I didn’t tell you...

01:09:11.801 --> 01:09:16.599
A few European universities have
invited me to lecture on my book.

01:09:16.765 --> 01:09:22.188
I told them, of course, that I
wanted to check with you first.

01:09:22.354 --> 01:09:27.736
- Sounds great. For how long?
- Three months.

01:09:27.903 --> 01:09:30.781
Three months?

01:09:32.158 --> 01:09:38.529
- All right, guys, let’s get going.
- How can baseball fascinate people?

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:42.295
You wind up
at the same place you started.

01:09:42.461 --> 01:09:50.511
This should interest you, because
it’s about stats and averages.

01:09:50.679 --> 01:09:58.260
When a player comes up, they flash
a three-digit number, his average.

01:09:58.437 --> 01:10:03.902
How many times he hits the ball,
in ratio to the number of attempts.

01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:25.135
Anybody see the game yesterday?
Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?

01:10:28.013 --> 01:10:31.882
Let me try
putting this another way.

01:10:32.059 --> 01:10:37.566
If a batter hits a ball, how can we
determine how far it will go?

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:43.990
What variables add up to a home run,
assuming the bum could hit one?

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:51.373
- The velocity of the ball?
- I have a question.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.544
Does a rising fastball really rise?

01:10:58.339 --> 01:11:02.802
I don’t know.
I'll have to ask my wife.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:09.644
I could not believe it. Suddenly
the room was filled with energy.

01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:15.985
We were exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.

01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:21.199
They participated,
they questioned, they stayed!

01:11:22.075 --> 01:11:29.041
I cannot thank you enough. I was
a better teacher because of you.

01:11:31.836 --> 01:11:37.134
- Fresh pepper?
- Not for her, but I'll have some.

01:11:37.301 --> 01:11:45.602
Could you bring her a side dish of
dressing? She likes a little extra.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:54.279
I feel I should return the favour.
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:12:00.243 --> 01:12:03.914
I'll have to think about that.

01:12:04.081 --> 01:12:08.419
Just glop it on.

01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:12.382
Enjoy your dinner.

01:12:14.343 --> 01:12:19.171
- You’re not eating.
- No, I'm watching your ritual.

01:12:19.348 --> 01:12:22.936
I just about got your sequence now.

01:12:23.103 --> 01:12:28.818
You start by rotating the plate
counterclockwise...

01:12:28.985 --> 01:12:35.033
...cut on the diagonal...
remove unwanted elements...

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:41.322
And now comes my favourite part:
The loading of the fork.

01:12:41.499 --> 01:12:46.463
It’s fascinating, the percentages
you use of different vegetables. -

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:53.805
- To create that one
harmoniously-balanced, perfect bite.

01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:13.859
You have a little...

01:13:16.247 --> 01:13:18.791
Don’t smear it.

01:13:28.844 --> 01:13:33.839
That might stain. You might want to
put a little soap on that.

01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:37.969
I'll be right back.

01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:05.344
I want to ask you something.

01:14:05.511 --> 01:14:08.682
- Don’t stop.
- I'm not a machine.

01:14:08.849 --> 01:14:15.606
We both have overwhelming feelings
for each other, don't we?

01:14:15.773 --> 01:14:21.113
- You’re doing great. Keep it up.
- Okay. Ready?

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.537
- Doesn’t that music infuriate you?
- Yeah, I'm livid.

01:14:28.913 --> 01:14:35.630
I came by your office today
for lunch, but you weren’t there.

01:14:35.796 --> 01:14:42.846
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.

01:14:43.013 --> 01:14:47.393
Rose, he’s a friend of mine,
but you have to watch out for him.

01:14:47.559 --> 01:14:53.650
- Believe me, I'm not his type.
- He can’t always control himself.

01:14:53.816 --> 01:15:00.574
- Did you pull something?
- I think so. Right here.

01:15:00.741 --> 01:15:03.661
A little lower.

01:15:03.828 --> 01:15:10.252
Lower.
Closer to the spine. There.

01:15:12.255 --> 01:15:16.634
Lean back.

01:15:17.385 --> 01:15:23.590
I thought you might like to meet me
in Europe after your classes end.

01:15:23.767 --> 01:15:31.401
- We never had a honeymoon.
- That’s right. I'd love that.

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:35.437
Would you?

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:43.697
- Am I pressing too hard?
- No, but I'm all sweaty.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:47.325
And I have to floss.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:55.137
When you’ve got to floss,
you’ve got to floss.

01:16:04.188 --> 01:16:06.431
I don’t know how to ask for it.

01:16:06.608 --> 01:16:11.322
We’re so polite, I feel like we’re
room-mates in a charm school.

01:16:11.489 --> 01:16:16.995
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
- I'm so frustrated, Claire.

01:16:17.161 --> 01:16:23.252
- Give him an "I want sex" look.
- He’ll think something’s in my eye.

01:16:23.419 --> 01:16:30.218
- You have to generate heat.
- Sometimes, I swear he feels it.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:36.225
Men aren't that bright. It's easy.
Be subtle, mysterious, seductive.

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:43.066
Subtle, mysterious, seductive? Why
don’t men come with instructions?

01:16:47.446 --> 01:16:53.286
- More coffee?
- Thanks. My tickets just arrived.

01:16:53.453 --> 01:16:58.751
My first lecture is in Paris,
on the 24th. I leave Saturday.

01:16:58.918 --> 01:17:02.964
- Do you want an English muffin?
- No, thanks.

01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:09.305
- I'm off. I have an early class.
- All right. Have a nice day.

01:17:11.265 --> 01:17:18.023
Oh... would saying now that I want
sex tonight be enough of a warning?

01:17:21.151 --> 01:17:25.866
Or should we wait till you come back
from Europe? Yeah, that’s better.

01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:31.027
No, no...
That’s fine.

01:17:33.457 --> 01:17:38.337
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.

01:17:41.216 --> 01:17:43.375
Have a nice day.

01:17:49.434 --> 01:17:55.691
- Have you ever tried making love?
- It’s never been about sex.

01:17:55.858 --> 01:18:02.480
I don’t understand. Things were
going so well. Sex now will ruin it.

01:18:02.657 --> 01:18:05.702
You’re a very sick man.

01:18:36.613 --> 01:18:43.620
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh, great.

01:18:45.122 --> 01:18:49.951
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.

01:18:50.128 --> 01:18:56.250
- One glass.
- All right, one glass.

01:19:00.723 --> 01:19:04.342
Same score?

01:19:07.272 --> 01:19:14.364
This is good. Sweet.
I normally don’t like sweet.

01:19:14.531 --> 01:19:18.285
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...

01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:27.588
Would you mind terribly
if we muted the TV?

01:19:33.553 --> 01:19:39.642
- What are you doing?
- Nothing... much.

01:19:45.066 --> 01:19:50.614
Would it be all right if I sat down?

01:19:59.207 --> 01:20:05.172
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.

01:20:10.053 --> 01:20:16.102
- Good game?
- I can’t hear.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:30.284
That’s all right.

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:35.999
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn’t spill a drop.

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:41.411
- I guess...
- That’s funny? I guess it’s funny.

01:20:43.925 --> 01:20:49.055
Do you think
we could turn the TV off?

01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:56.105
That’s better.

01:20:56.272 --> 01:21:00.986
- We have to relax.
- I agree.

01:21:02.947 --> 01:21:10.121
- How are classes?
- Going well.

01:21:10.288 --> 01:21:15.795
- And your book?
- The outline is actually...

01:21:16.837 --> 01:21:24.336
It’s... It’s coming along.
It’s almost there.

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:31.145
It’s not at all what I expected.
It’s harder than I thought.

01:21:31.312 --> 01:21:34.649
But I'll...

01:21:35.775 --> 01:21:41.574
I'm sure that... I'll get there.

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:45.360
I want you to get there.

01:21:56.007 --> 01:21:59.177
What did you say?

01:21:59.344 --> 01:22:03.766
- Rose...
- Talk to me.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:30.213
Oh, yes... Oh, no...

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:34.968
Oh, God.
Oh, Rose.

01:22:35.135 --> 01:22:38.973
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:43.770
I don’t want to do this!
I'm sorry, Rose.

01:23:22.689 --> 01:23:30.073
I have to say, Rose, that I'm a
little confused. A bit disappointed.

01:23:33.284 --> 01:23:40.293
It was going so well.
At least, I thought so. Didn’t you?

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:47.551
Is that the truth, or some kind of
manipulation? Tell me the truth.

01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:53.349
You knew the agreement, how I felt.
Did you think it would change?

01:23:53.516 --> 01:23:56.936
Why?

01:23:57.103 --> 01:24:03.778
I hoped, though I made the offer,
you’d see there was no need for it.

01:24:03.945 --> 01:24:06.865
I'd hoped that we’d got beyond it.

01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:10.077
Did you think
this was the next step?

01:24:11.661 --> 01:24:18.587
What we have usually comes after
all this nonsense is over.

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:23.832
Most never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going. -

01:24:24.009 --> 01:24:31.184
- Or find another. Our relationship
works because it isn’t physical.

01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:36.774
I took every precaution to make sure
there was no physical attraction!

01:24:38.859 --> 01:24:43.906
Rose, I'm sorry.

01:24:47.828 --> 01:24:54.418
I've never had this with a woman.
I can share everything with you.

01:24:57.339 --> 01:25:02.053
Are you not satisfied with me?

01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:10.729
Maybe this is something we have to
struggle through together.

01:25:10.896 --> 01:25:18.478
Maybe this tour is coming at a good
time. Maybe we can use the distance.

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:24.328
Don’t you think?
I thought we were good friends.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:33.214
Talk to me, Rose. Let me in.
I'm sorry.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.513
Open the door.

01:25:46.395 --> 01:25:52.819
Open the door, please.
Come on, Rose.

01:27:07.196 --> 01:27:10.449
What are you doing here?

01:27:13.286 --> 01:27:17.791
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?

01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:21.963
What happened? Is it Gregory?

01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:26.926
I don’t want to say I told you so,
but...

01:27:27.093 --> 01:27:30.139
- Mom.
- What?

01:27:30.305 --> 01:27:35.853
When I was a baby,
did you think I was pretty?

01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:41.193
All babies are pretty.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.698
No, I mean me.

01:27:50.828 --> 01:27:56.210
You must have thought something
about how I looked.

01:27:56.377 --> 01:28:03.134
Oh, what’s pretty, anyway?
What good did it do your sister?

01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:14.898
Do you remember
when I was a little girl?

01:28:16.942 --> 01:28:23.992
You told me to push up my nose
with my index finger.

01:28:24.158 --> 01:28:29.372
- So it wouldn’t droop.
- I did not! Are you drunk?

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:36.256
That’s what you told me. It’s funny,
I never would have thought -

01:28:36.423 --> 01:28:43.180
- That I wasn’t pretty, if it
weren’t for those things you said.

01:28:43.347 --> 01:28:48.644
If you came to say more cruel things
to me, I'm going to bed.

01:28:48.812 --> 01:28:52.065
- Mom...
- What?

01:28:53.484 --> 01:28:57.154
- How did it feel?
- What?

01:28:57.322 --> 01:29:03.036
Being beautiful?
No, I mean it.

01:29:03.203 --> 01:29:10.461
How did it feel having people
look at you with such admiration?

01:29:11.754 --> 01:29:20.629
Looking at yourself in the mirror
with such appreciation?

01:29:22.851 --> 01:29:27.022
How did that feel?

01:29:34.238 --> 01:29:37.450
It was wonderful.

01:29:48.087 --> 01:29:51.258
I bet.

01:29:58.099 --> 01:30:05.148
- This is Gregory. Is Rose there?
- She's out. Can I take a message?

01:30:05.316 --> 01:30:10.113
No. I've been giving you messages,
and she hasn’t called back.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.232
- I want to say goodbye to my wife.
- I'll tell her.

01:30:27.174 --> 01:30:33.796
I wanted to say goodbye to you
myself, not through your mother.

01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:39.396
I don't like leaving this way,
but my plane is here.

01:30:39.563 --> 01:30:43.776
I hope your mother
doesn't erase this message.

01:30:45.695 --> 01:30:49.616
I don't know what else to say.

01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:56.958
I wanted to say goodbye to you
myself, not through your mother.

01:31:11.224 --> 01:31:16.053
- You’re up early.
- I haven’t been to bed.

01:31:18.316 --> 01:31:22.320
- You haven’t been to bed?
- No.

01:31:23.154 --> 01:31:27.951
Why not?

01:31:28.118 --> 01:31:32.499
I had a lot to think about,
after you left.

01:31:32.666 --> 01:31:37.379
It’s awful to leave a woman my age
alone with her thoughts.

01:31:44.178 --> 01:31:48.475
You really love him, don’t you?

01:31:50.686 --> 01:31:55.107
You do, it’s obvious.

01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:01.907
That feeling...

01:32:02.073 --> 01:32:06.788
...you have for Gregory...

01:32:08.414 --> 01:32:15.881
I don’t think I ever felt that.
Not even for your father.

01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:24.641
It’s not easy for me to say.
Especially to you.

01:32:27.352 --> 01:32:32.234
It’s awful
to look back on your life -

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:36.905
- And realise that you’ve settled.

01:32:37.072 --> 01:32:41.900
The problem was that I always felt
I had more time.

01:32:42.077 --> 01:32:48.835
I was...
Now, inside, I feel young.

01:32:49.002 --> 01:32:55.802
Like it’s the beginning.
Like I have everything ahead of me.

01:32:56.594 --> 01:32:59.890
But I don’t.

01:33:00.932 --> 01:33:06.272
So I guess I am jealous.

01:33:08.775 --> 01:33:16.658
Parents don’t have a plan
to hurt their children.

01:33:17.285 --> 01:33:25.378
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- I'm not that hurt.

01:33:26.795 --> 01:33:31.050
Do you know what I thought
when you were a baby?

01:33:31.217 --> 01:33:38.267
That you looked just like your dad,
and that Claire looked like me.

01:33:38.434 --> 01:33:41.937
What’s that?

01:33:44.691 --> 01:33:52.074
She was so pretty, even then.
Look at those eyes. Those lips.

01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:55.078
That’s not Claire, that’s you.

01:33:55.245 --> 01:33:59.197
Me?
I never saw this picture.

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:05.674
- I found it when I was cleaning up.
- This was me?

01:34:06.758 --> 01:34:09.511
I was pretty?

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:15.184
Your father adored you.
But you know that.

01:34:15.351 --> 01:34:20.481
He never felt that way about Claire.
Only you.

01:34:20.649 --> 01:34:25.613
I don’t think he ever held a baby
until you came.

01:34:25.779 --> 01:34:30.243
He never wanted to let you go.

01:34:34.039 --> 01:34:38.951
- I'm glad you found this.
- So am I.

01:34:41.255 --> 01:34:43.716
She was very pretty.

01:34:43.883 --> 01:34:50.057
You were very pretty.
Remember that.

01:35:50.752 --> 01:35:56.842
Thank you for your warm welcome.
It’s an honour for me to be here.

01:35:57.009 --> 01:36:03.099
Rose, I'd love to speak with you.
I never seem to catch you at home.

01:36:03.266 --> 01:36:09.388
We should discuss this, Rose. I have
no judgement over what happened.

01:36:09.565 --> 01:36:14.643
I'm leaving for Venice tomorrow
and wanted to say happy birthday.

01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.950
I have a present for you.
It’s a week at a baseball camp.

01:36:31.381 --> 01:36:34.833
Hello, Rose?

01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:39.891
Rose, are you there?

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.608
- Henry, have you heard from her?
- She cancelled her summer classes.

01:36:47.775 --> 01:36:52.030
- How do you know that?
- I called her mother.

01:36:52.197 --> 01:36:59.330
- Rose, try this one. It’s an eight.
- I like the black one, in a six.

01:36:59.496 --> 01:37:07.047
Rose, I can’t believe how childishly
you’re behaving. It’s unlike you.

01:37:07.214 --> 01:37:10.717
- How did she finally persuade you?
- It’s a long story.

01:37:10.885 --> 01:37:16.683
I'm changing my plans.
I'll be in New York on Monday.

01:37:16.849 --> 01:37:23.733
My number here is:
01-71-25773-55.

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.113
All prime numbers, by the way.

01:37:41.378 --> 01:37:44.548
Hello?

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:59.722
Rose?
Are you there?

01:38:05.447 --> 01:38:10.202
- Rose?
- I'll be right out.

01:38:33.687 --> 01:38:36.899
May I have a glass, too?

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:06.225
Good to see you, Greg.
How was your trip?

01:39:08.477 --> 01:39:11.053
Are you all right?

01:39:11.230 --> 01:39:17.154
- Traveling doesn’t agree with me.
- You need a glass of water?

01:39:17.321 --> 01:39:21.951
- What happened to you?
- I just made a few changes.

01:39:22.117 --> 01:39:26.289
- What did you do to your hair?
- I lightened it.

01:39:26.456 --> 01:39:35.800
- And you’re wearing make-up.
- Women do that from time to time.

01:39:35.967 --> 01:39:40.847
It’s not like I had surgery,
although my mother offered.

01:39:41.014 --> 01:39:44.519
- Are you hungry?
- You never wore make-up.

01:39:44.685 --> 01:39:50.651
I know. The no-frills girl.
Like I said, I made some changes.

01:39:50.817 --> 01:39:53.737
And you lost weight.

01:39:53.904 --> 01:39:59.327
These have no oil or butter.
You just have to get used to it.

01:39:59.494 --> 01:40:06.335
- What have you done?
- I put on make-up and lost weight.

01:40:06.502 --> 01:40:12.707
You don’t return my calls, you
completely cut me off, then this...

01:40:15.345 --> 01:40:18.599
I'm... speechless.

01:40:22.144 --> 01:40:27.442
- I guess you don’t like it.
- Don’t like it? I'm in shock.

01:40:27.609 --> 01:40:32.198
I come home to find a completely
different woman. Why did you do it?

01:40:32.364 --> 01:40:35.493
Why do I have to explain this?

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:41.124
I'm your husband. And I married
a woman who looked a certain way.

01:40:41.291 --> 01:40:47.090
- I feel sort of betrayed.
- Oh, please!

01:40:47.256 --> 01:40:51.428
You had no right.
Why did you do this to me?

01:40:51.595 --> 01:40:58.102
Do what to you? What does it matter
how I look? You never look at me.

01:40:58.269 --> 01:41:04.317
If appearance doesn’t matter,
what’s wrong with this appearance?

01:41:04.484 --> 01:41:07.447
Sorry if it upsets
your mathematical equation.

01:41:07.613 --> 01:41:12.608
"Handsome, frightened man marries
unattractive, desperate woman."

01:41:12.785 --> 01:41:20.878
I was simply expecting someone else.
I'll just have to get used to it.

01:41:21.045 --> 01:41:26.969
- You don’t have to get used to it.
- What do you mean?

01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:31.088
I don’t want to continue.

01:41:32.517 --> 01:41:36.302
I don’t understand.

01:41:36.479 --> 01:41:45.323
I apologize. I settled
for something that I didn’t want.

01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:52.331
I thought I could live with that.
But I lied, to myself and to you.

01:41:52.498 --> 01:41:58.046
To be honest, I think your theory
about relationships is bullshit.

01:41:58.213 --> 01:42:05.304
I believe in love, lust, sex and
romance, not in a perfect equation.

01:42:05.471 --> 01:42:10.299
I want mess and chaos. I want
someone to go crazy for me.

01:42:10.476 --> 01:42:16.316
I want passion and heat and sweat
and madness! Valentines and cupids!

01:42:16.483 --> 01:42:21.030
I want it all,
and I want to thank you. -

01:42:21.197 --> 01:42:26.026
- Because you forced me to look at
things I was too scared to look at.

01:42:26.203 --> 01:42:30.917
Imagine, all this time I kept up
this ridiculous fantasy -

01:42:31.083 --> 01:42:37.288
- That you, like Alex, would fall in
love with me. It was wrong of me.

01:42:37.466 --> 01:42:41.595
- But I think...
- I know. Just let me finish.

01:42:41.762 --> 01:42:46.757
- I feel...
- Strongly about your beliefs. Fine.

01:42:46.935 --> 01:42:53.943
I'm sorry I broke the agreement,
but I fell in love with you.

01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:59.105
But it’s all right now, because
I'm not in love with you any more.

01:43:01.576 --> 01:43:03.903
What?

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:10.128
Which now makes me perfect for this,
but now I don’t want this marriage.

01:43:15.426 --> 01:43:20.890
Suddenly dinner doesn’t seem like
such a good idea.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.563
I should go.

01:43:27.690 --> 01:43:33.529
- Are you going to your mother’s?
- Just until I find my own place.

01:43:35.657 --> 01:43:41.705
I hope at some point we can pick up
where we left off, as friends.

01:43:41.872 --> 01:43:48.411
Thanks. You’re the first man who
wanted to marry me, for any reason.

01:43:50.883 --> 01:43:54.637
Can I call you tomorrow?

01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:59.800
What for?

01:44:21.793 --> 01:44:28.081
You all have copies of the syllabus?
There will be four short papers.

01:44:28.259 --> 01:44:32.680
Be prepared to also discuss these
in class.

01:44:32.847 --> 01:44:41.638
Some of my students from last term
can tell you how important...

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:47.531
What?

01:44:47.697 --> 01:44:54.497
Yes, I have breasts. They cannot,
however, be the subject for a paper.

01:44:54.664 --> 01:44:57.584
A double play!

01:44:57.751 --> 01:45:03.383
I miss her, but I'm proud
that I stood up for what I believe.

01:45:03.549 --> 01:45:09.264
It could have worked. Not with her,
but it was an invaluable experience.

01:45:11.391 --> 01:45:17.931
You’re in bad shape, aren’t you?
May I make a suggestion?

01:45:18.108 --> 01:45:22.863
Put all your valuable possessions
in storage.

01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:28.025
- Why?
- So you won’t break anything.

01:45:28.202 --> 01:45:34.251
I just told you, I'm fine. I'm using
all of this in my next book.

01:45:34.417 --> 01:45:37.630
Especially glass.

01:45:37.797 --> 01:45:43.094
I miss him, Claire.
But I don’t think he’s ready for me.

01:45:44.179 --> 01:45:50.603
I still can’t get used to seeing you
like this. It’s sort of unnerving.

01:45:50.770 --> 01:45:53.179
You’re just like the rest of us now.

01:45:53.356 --> 01:46:00.615
Now you’ll spend an hour in front of
the mirror, every morning and night.

01:46:00.781 --> 01:46:07.070
Now you'll be scanning for who looks
better than you and who doesn’t.

01:46:07.247 --> 01:46:10.782
As the years go by,
the numbers change. -

01:46:10.959 --> 01:46:16.341
- Until you walk into a room and
you’re the last one any man notices.

01:46:17.801 --> 01:46:23.223
Rose?
My God! Rose!

01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:28.553
- Hi, Alex.
- I can’t believe it’s you.

01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:32.985
- Alex, get a fucking grip.
- You look incredible. Doesn’t she?

01:46:33.152 --> 01:46:36.771
Yes, we already covered that.

01:47:11.904 --> 01:47:14.657
I thought you hated salad.

01:47:14.824 --> 01:47:19.120
I can’t eat a cheeseburger
in the middle of the day any more.

01:47:19.288 --> 01:47:23.584
- Doesn’t it bloat you?
- No.

01:47:23.751 --> 01:47:29.674
I thought it went well with
the spareribs I had for breakfast.

01:47:33.845 --> 01:47:38.643
- What’s the matter?
- I'm sorry.

01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:44.649
I always thought we’d be in the
same boat. It made it easier.

01:47:51.073 --> 01:47:54.286
I'll tell you what.

01:47:54.452 --> 01:47:59.959
I'll give you half my salad if you
give me half your burger.

01:48:00.126 --> 01:48:04.131
- We’ll need some more dressing.
- Definitely. Waiter!

01:48:04.297 --> 01:48:08.302
We all want to be attractive.
But remember:

01:48:08.469 --> 01:48:17.343
One of the first things
people notice is your smile.

01:48:18.814 --> 01:48:22.599
Your appearance is probably
important to you.

01:48:22.776 --> 01:48:28.116
We spend so much time, energy and
money in an effort to look good.

01:48:28.283 --> 01:48:31.735
We all want to be attractive.

01:48:51.685 --> 01:48:54.604
Hello, it's Alex.

01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:59.850
- How are you?
- I'm trying to get on with my life.

01:49:00.028 --> 01:49:04.658
- What’s wrong with you?
- Claire's gone.

01:49:06.493 --> 01:49:12.667
I came home to surprise her at lunch
and found her with her masseur.

01:49:12.834 --> 01:49:17.089
It’s my own fault.
Claire hates surprises.

01:49:17.255 --> 01:49:24.013
- Alex, I'm really sorry.
- I don’t know why she wasn’t happy.

01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:29.937
- I couldn’t have loved her more.
- It wouldn’t have mattered.

01:49:30.103 --> 01:49:37.529
- Claire was jealous of you.
- Jealous of me?

01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:40.741
She got so mad
every time I'd talk about you.

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:44.161
She thought I had a crush on you.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.739
Maybe she was right.

01:49:52.086 --> 01:49:59.512
Do you want to have dinner with me?
I'm asking you to dinner.

01:49:59.679 --> 01:50:06.812
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.

01:50:08.939 --> 01:50:14.404
- D! You’re improving!
- I don’t understand twin primes.

01:50:14.571 --> 01:50:17.147
I'm explaining it!

01:50:17.324 --> 01:50:23.779
An infinite set minus an infinite
number leaves an infinite number.

01:50:23.956 --> 01:50:29.202
We spent time on this! My wife
understood it on our first date!

01:50:33.092 --> 01:50:35.668
Class dismissed!

01:50:36.846 --> 01:50:40.434
Get out of here! Go!

01:50:52.156 --> 01:50:55.367
Very enjoyable dinner.

01:50:55.534 --> 01:50:59.622
- Did you cook it yourself?
- Yes, I did.

01:50:59.789 --> 01:51:03.627
- What a liar.
- Yes, I am.

01:51:05.129 --> 01:51:07.965
What?

01:51:08.132 --> 01:51:13.513
I only smoke when I'm with you.
I wonder why?

01:51:21.438 --> 01:51:28.280
I can’t thank you enough
for the other day. For tonight.

01:51:29.281 --> 01:51:35.486
You’re such an inspiration.
The way you’ve changed...

01:51:35.663 --> 01:51:41.337
...evolved, I guess,
is a better word. -

01:51:41.504 --> 01:51:48.219
- Into this beautiful... smart...

01:51:49.178 --> 01:51:53.392
...very sexy...

01:52:01.026 --> 01:52:07.950
I must have loved you all along.
I just didn’t know it.

01:52:09.994 --> 01:52:13.373
What an idiot.

01:52:18.212 --> 01:52:26.013
Hannah, this is ridiculous.
She can’t not talk to me forever.

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:32.520
- What are you doing?
- I have to explain things.

01:52:32.687 --> 01:52:37.567
- It’s a little late for that.
- No, I don't think so.

01:52:37.734 --> 01:52:42.813
What Rose and I have goes far beyond
what normal people...

01:52:42.991 --> 01:52:47.902
What's all that noise? What are you
trying to say? What is going on?

01:52:48.079 --> 01:52:55.296
- Put her on the damn phone now!
- She's not here.

01:52:55.463 --> 01:53:00.510
I might as well tell you,
she's with Alex now.

01:53:00.677 --> 01:53:06.476
She’s with him now. You know
how much she’s always cared for him.

01:53:06.642 --> 01:53:10.981
So I see no point in you
pursuing this any further.

01:53:20.825 --> 01:53:27.364
I'm sorry to keep you waiting. So,
Mr. Jenkins, which do you like best?

01:53:27.541 --> 01:53:32.672
To be perfectly honest,
I think you’re more beautiful now.

01:53:34.299 --> 01:53:37.052
Good answer.

01:53:41.474 --> 01:53:50.233
What did you mean by, you must
have loved me but didn’t know it?

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:56.449
- I'd like an answer.
- You were different then.

01:53:56.616 --> 01:54:02.164
- How could you have loved me then?
- I loved you for who you were.

01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:08.421
So now you want who I am
because I'm not who I was any more?

01:54:09.547 --> 01:54:12.509
Rose, what?

01:54:12.676 --> 01:54:17.973
I have dreamt about this moment
from the first day we met.

01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:24.397
I've played out what you’d say and
what you’d think a million times.

01:54:24.564 --> 01:54:30.196
- But you were better in my head.
- Maybe I've had too much to drink.

01:54:30.363 --> 01:54:34.868
It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t
feel anything. Isn’t that great?

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:39.373
I never thought about my feelings,
only yours.

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:46.381
- I didn’t think I was good enough.
- Oh, but you are!

01:54:46.548 --> 01:54:52.639
I know. But Alex,
you’re not good enough for me.

01:54:58.186 --> 01:55:02.816
She’s with Alex now, Henry.

01:55:02.984 --> 01:55:07.364
I don’t know if it’s my head
or my stomach.

01:55:07.531 --> 01:55:14.789
I might have Chinese food poisoning.
Maybe my Szechwan chicken was a cat.

01:55:16.165 --> 01:55:19.127
I'm so dizzy.

01:55:19.294 --> 01:55:25.301
I was all alone,
and I didn’t know what to do.

01:55:25.467 --> 01:55:29.972
- I'm sorry, Henry.
- You’ll just stay here tonight.

01:55:30.139 --> 01:55:34.561
Henry, I love Rose.

01:55:34.728 --> 01:55:42.528
The old Rose. The one with no
make-up who loves the perfect bite.

01:55:42.695 --> 01:55:47.492
I love her. It’s real.
It’s not based on passion. -

01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:54.167
- Although I feel that. Or lust,
although I feel that.

01:55:55.168 --> 01:56:03.511
Or even physical attraction. She...
Though I thought she was beautiful.

01:56:03.678 --> 01:56:11.176
Her eyes, her mouth. The way she
held herself, made fun of herself.

01:56:12.062 --> 01:56:17.819
She eats carrots now.
Isn’t that tragic?

01:56:17.986 --> 01:56:20.280
What am I going to do?

01:56:20.447 --> 01:56:25.869
In the last two years
I've been with 11 different women.

01:56:26.037 --> 01:56:31.334
Most of them half my age. Not one
with a sense of humor I understood.

01:56:31.501 --> 01:56:37.300
I don’t do it because they’re smart.
I gave one "A Farewell to Arms". -

01:56:37.466 --> 01:56:41.888
- And she thought
it was a diet book.

01:57:02.579 --> 01:57:07.042
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I want to see Miss Morgan.

01:57:07.209 --> 01:57:13.883
It’s kind of late to visit. I don’t
think she’d want to be disturbed.

01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:20.807
I believe... I know her
a lot better than you do.

01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:26.022
Rose!

01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:29.640
Do you hear that?

01:57:29.818 --> 01:57:33.113
What the hell is going on?

01:57:35.199 --> 01:57:41.456
- It’s him, isn’t it?
- Gregory!

01:57:41.623 --> 01:57:47.004
Oh, God!
I can’t believe this.

01:57:47.171 --> 01:57:52.218
- What is he doing out there?
- I'm going to find out.

01:57:52.385 --> 01:57:56.723
- He’s insane.
- I know. Isn’t it wonderful?

01:58:01.312 --> 01:58:05.858
Get the hell out of here!
People are trying to sleep.

01:58:08.779 --> 01:58:11.355
You had enough?

01:58:11.532 --> 01:58:15.578
- Stop!
- I'll call the police.

01:58:15.745 --> 01:58:20.333
- No, this is my husband.
- He doesn’t have a key?

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.962
I said I knew her better than you.

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:28.843
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:32.014
Why did you come to see me?

01:58:32.181 --> 01:58:37.938
In light of our last conversation,
and after speaking with Henry...

01:58:38.104 --> 01:58:42.443
...although you might have serious
reservations about considering...

01:58:42.609 --> 01:58:47.573
Gregory, I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?

01:58:52.328 --> 01:58:55.999
God, you’re beautiful.

01:58:56.708 --> 01:59:01.046
Thank you.
Thank you, Gregory.

01:59:06.678 --> 01:59:09.766
What?

01:59:10.975 --> 01:59:17.982
I'm so sorry for the way I acted
and the things I said.

01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:23.229
I know that I hurt you.
That was the last thing I...

01:59:23.406 --> 01:59:29.038
- I accept your apology.
- Let me finish. This is important.

01:59:32.583 --> 01:59:37.662
That night...
That terrible night...

01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:44.889
I wanted you so much,
I couldn’t see straight.

01:59:47.975 --> 01:59:53.982
I have to make sure you know that.
It wasn’t you.

01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:56.944
You’re a very sexy girl.

01:59:59.197 --> 02:00:04.744
I know it’s unfair of me to say so,
now you’re with Alex.

02:00:04.911 --> 02:00:11.670
- Who said I was with Alex?
- Your mother.

02:00:11.836 --> 02:00:15.131
My mother? Oh, great.

02:00:17.759 --> 02:00:24.601
- I'm not with Alex.
- You’re not?

02:00:27.771 --> 02:00:34.028
- Well...
- Talk to me.

02:00:35.738 --> 02:00:39.409
Rose... I love you.

02:00:41.954 --> 02:00:45.124
And I want to be married to you.

02:00:46.376 --> 02:00:51.089
Gregory, you are married to me.

02:00:52.216 --> 02:00:56.971
That’s right. Yeah, right.

02:00:59.265 --> 02:01:06.315
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
- It’ll pass. Just hold on.

02:01:06.481 --> 02:01:12.113
- Rose, don’t ever leave me again.
- I'm not leaving you. I love you.

02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.367
I couldn’t stand
being away from you.

02:01:16.410 --> 02:01:20.623
I don’t care if you are pretty.
I love you anyway.

02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:26.036
Everything will drop as I get older,
and I'm gaining weight as we speak.

02:01:26.213 --> 02:01:28.789
That’s comforting.

02:05:33.537 --> 02:05:37.833
- Get in, lady.
- Oh no, not you again!

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.174
- Your windows are still broke?
- Complain to the cab company.
