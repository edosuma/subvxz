00:05.506 --> 00:10.421
Piccolo and Goku finally defeat Raditz.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.504
However, the peril to Earth was just beginning.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.589
Goku's sacrifice weighed heavily

00:16.684 --> 00:21.144
on Kuririn and the others he left behind.

00:21.230 --> 00:25.189

01:52.112 --> 01:59.826
"Run in the Next World, Son Goku!
The Million-Kilo-Long Serpentine Road. "

02:07.252 --> 02:08.502
I'll bet that right now,

02:08.586 --> 02:12.876
Goku-sa and the others are havin'
a fun time at the Kame House.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.458
I wonder if Gohan's fittin' in with them okay.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.544
Then again, he'll be fine.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.465
He's a well-behaved boy.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.302
| wish I would've gone.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.432
Gohan-chan!

02:33.320 --> 02:35.060
Pa!

02:37.074 --> 02:42.694
Chichi, where's Gohan-chan? Hey, Gohan-chan!

02:42.788 --> 02:45.996
I brought you a whole heap of presents!

02:47.626 --> 02:49.366
Pa!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.915
Goku!

02:53.006 --> 02:56.339
Gokull

02:56.426 --> 02:57.927
Goku!

02:58.011 --> 03:00.423
--Goku...
--Hey, Goku!

03:00.514 --> 03:04.473
Son-kun, don't die!

03:04.560 --> 03:08.599
Goku! Goku!

03:14.236 --> 03:16.943
He disappeared!

03:17.030 --> 03:21.865
| get it. This is Kami's doing.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.910
He's about the only one who
could do something like this.

03:24.997 --> 03:28.615
The bastard has another
one of his worthless ideas.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.245
I wonder what he intends to do.

03:30.335 --> 03:34.749
Hmm... T-Then again, if it's
Kami-sama, I suppose we can relax.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.754
Whatever the case, we have to
gather the other six Dragon Balls

03:42.848 --> 03:45.055
and bring Goku back to life right away.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.724
Man! At a critical time like this,

03:47.811 --> 03:50.928
where could Yamucha and
the others have gone off to?!

03:51.023 --> 03:53.856
You're the one who drove him off, aren't you?

03:53.942 --> 03:59.903
You know, I wonder how Son-kun's
brother knew where he was so easily.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.733
It's that strange device
he is wearing on his face.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.069
Apparently, it can tell an
opponent's strength and location.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.875
--Kuririn...
--R-Right!

04:13.962 --> 04:15.873
Right, right, right...

04:20.886 --> 04:23.628
That's it, there. Kuririn, grab it for me, okay?

04:23.722 --> 04:26.384
Eh? Uh, o-okay.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.717
He's not going to come back
to life or anything, right?

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.575 --> 04:47.159
Let's see, this goes like that...

04:49.581 --> 04:51.617
This gizmo is amazing.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.825
It's a little damaged, but I think
I can do something with it.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.753
You're incredible, Bulma-san.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.797
Once I take this back,
study it, and refurbish it,

05:00.884 --> 05:05.423
we might be able to locate
Yamucha, Tenshinhan and the others.

05:05.514 --> 05:09.223
Well, in any case, let's get
back to the Kame House.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.142
Right. There's nothing
more we can do here, huh?

05:12.229 --> 05:13.685
Okay then, afterward,

05:13.772 --> 05:16.559
I'll start looking for the
Dragon Balls, right away.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.687
Piccolo, what do you intend to do--

05:41.466 --> 05:44.128
Just like a lizard's tail...

05:44.219 --> 05:46.505
You guys look for the Dragon Balls.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.885
Kami doesn't have the power to
bring people back to life himself.

05:50.976 --> 05:55.891
But I will be taking charge
of Son Goku's son there.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.437
W-What are you going to do?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.311
That Gohan kid could become a powerful force,

06:00.402 --> 06:03.064
depending on how he is trained.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.862
If we're going to prevail
against the two Saiyans

06:05.949 --> 06:09.908
who will be coming in one year,
we're going to need his strength.

06:11.329 --> 06:15.038
In order for that to happen,
I'm going to have to train him.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.491
You can't be serious.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.544
I'm not sure that's going to go over well...

06:21.590 --> 06:24.957
Mm-hmm, we'll have to ask Goku,
and the boy's mother, Chichi, first.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.465
We can't afford the time!

06:28.555 --> 06:33.345
Don't give me any trouble,
or I'll kill you, and then take him!

06:45.697 --> 06:50.236
Once a year is up, I'll come to
your house, together with the kid.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.192
Once you bring Son Goku back to life,

06:52.287 --> 06:55.529
tell him he can look
forward to seeing him then.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.084
I don't know... I don't know about this...

07:05.175 --> 07:09.134
He's gonna die! If he's lucky,
he'll just turn out delinquent!

07:10.972 --> 07:13.679
With that in mind, he has arrived here

07:13.767 --> 07:17.009
in flesh-and-blood form,
wishing to be allowed to train.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.015
Please, Great King Yama,

07:19.106 --> 07:24.146
| humbly ask that you permit
this man to call upon Kaio-sama.

07:25.737 --> 07:30.572
Son Goku, huh? Indeed,
your marks are outstanding.

07:30.659 --> 07:34.072
You're saying that even
though he could go to Heaven,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.619
he wants to risk the danger of
traversing the Serpentine Road

07:36.706 --> 07:38.833
to see Kaio-sama, is that it?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.407
Yes, sir.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.869
Hey, does everyone come here once they die?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.920
--That's right.
--Even aliens?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.295
Mm-hmm. Everyone who is
dead comes here to be judged,

07:49.386 --> 07:52.048
to see if they go to Heaven or Hell.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.629
Hey, just a little before I got here,

07:53.723 --> 07:56.214
did a guy named Raditz pop in here?

07:56.309 --> 07:59.551
Watch it! You have to say "come through here."

07:59.646 --> 08:02.183
Yeah, he came through here, all right.

08:02.274 --> 08:07.940
He was your brother, right?
He was sent to Hell, naturally.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.644
He didn't make any trouble?

08:09.739 --> 08:15.450
Oh, he made trouble. He made
trouble, but I overpowered him.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.996
You're pretty strong, ain't you, taking
someone as awesome as he was?

08:21.710 --> 08:24.417
Maybe I should have pops here train me!

08:24.504 --> 08:26.460
Shh! You're being too loud!

08:26.548 --> 08:28.880
You shouldn't be using language
like that about Great King Yama!

08:28.967 --> 08:30.298
But...

08:30.385 --> 08:35.721
Keep quiet! Kaio-sama is even stronger!

08:35.807 --> 08:38.264
I heard that, Kami of Earth!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.340
Ulp!

08:39.436 --> 08:43.349
Once you die, maybe I
ought to send you to Hell.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.226
P-Please forgive me!

08:45.317 --> 08:46.898
I never imagined you
would be able to hear that!

08:46.985 --> 08:51.445
You've got the devil's
own ears, all right! Get it?

08:54.201 --> 08:57.568
You've no sense of humor, huh?

08:57.662 --> 08:59.198
No...

09:00.498 --> 09:06.289
Very well. If you want to go that
badly, you may go to Kaio-sama.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.711
T-Thank you very much!

09:08.798 --> 09:13.087
I'll call over a guide for you.
Go out that way and wait.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.714
'Kay!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.841
However...!

09:17.933 --> 09:21.972
Don't come crying to me if you
fall off of the Serpentine Road.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.271
Well, do your best.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.520
This whole year will be a challenge for you.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.318
Yeah. I'm not sure what you're getting at,

09:32.405 --> 09:35.522
but anyhow, I'm gonna go
and see this Kaio-sama guy.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.448
Mm-hmm.

09:37.535 --> 09:41.153
Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

09:46.753 --> 09:52.419
I have to say, Earth has attracted
the attention of some real bad eggs.

09:52.509 --> 09:57.253
This time around, things
could get really dangerous.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.214
Even if we wished for
Shen Long to eliminate them,

10:00.308 --> 10:04.096
I doubt he could prevail against
the Saiyans' tremendous power.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.554
Even with Son Goku receiving
training from Kaio-sama,

10:07.649 --> 10:10.265
just how far will he be able to come?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.942
Only Goku's son can save us.

10:13.029 --> 10:17.363
How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.702
And with only the limited
time we have, how exactly--

10:19.786 --> 10:21.287
Shut up!

10:21.371 --> 10:24.454
You're in the way! Would you leave, already?!

10:26.293 --> 10:31.208
S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
I'm very sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

10:34.009 --> 10:35.874
Thank you for waiting.

10:35.969 --> 10:41.339
Now then, I will show you
to the serpent's head.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.674
The Serpentine Road is quite harrowing.

10:43.768 --> 10:47.226
Are you in good physical health?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.474
No...

10:48.565 --> 10:52.274
I'm dead, so I suppose
I ain't in very good health.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.727
Say, what's this Kaio-sama guy like?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.609
Sir, Kaio-sama is the gentleman

10:58.700 --> 11:02.033
that reigns over all other
deities in the universe.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.489
Oh, yeah? I'm sure he
must be pretty strong, then.

11:27.270 --> 11:31.513
We can't very well not say
anything to Chichi about this.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.851
Kuririn, you go over there
and explain the situation to her.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.779
Eh?! M-Me?!

11:39.866 --> 11:43.779
It sounds like she's a domineering
mother, so you're dead for sure.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.578
Sir, we have arrived.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.177
This is the Serpentine Road?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.800
Yes.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.014
What do I do now?

12:10.105 --> 12:13.597
Please follow the serpent all the way down.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.774
It leads to where Kaio-sama is.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.318
It sure looks long.

12:19.406 --> 12:24.196
Yes, sir. According to legend,
it is about a million kilometers long.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.321
A million kilos?!

12:26.413 --> 12:28.870
Has anyone ever made it to the end?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.868
Over these last hundred million years,

12:30.959 --> 12:34.827
I believe that Great King Yama
is the only one who has.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.412
That older guy, huh?

12:37.507 --> 12:40.419
But then, if there is
someone who's made it there,

12:40.510 --> 12:42.796
maybe I'll be able to manage it, too.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.926
Ah, please be absolutely
sure not to fall into the clouds.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.223
Beneath the clouds is where Hell is, after all,

12:49.310 --> 12:51.175
and you will not be able to return.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.478
Oh, okay.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.057
Aw, rats. I should have
packed something for lunch.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.063
That's okay, sir.

12:59.154 --> 13:04.194
You are already deceased,
so I doubt you will die of hunger.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.615
Oh, yeah.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.533
Well...

13:07.620 --> 13:10.612
Oh, right! I have a favor to ask.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.696
Yes?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.453
Do you know Uranai Baba?

13:14.544 --> 13:17.411
Yes, sir. She visits here once in a while.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.918
Thank goodness! Next time she comes here,

13:21.009 --> 13:24.126
ask her to tell Old Man Turtle Hermit

13:24.220 --> 13:27.804
not to bring me back to life for one year, okay?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.722
Very good, sir.

13:29.809 --> 13:34.929
Let's see... for one year...
to Mr. Turtle Hermit, right?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.432
Okay, let's give this a go.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.860
So as long as I don't fall
off the snake, I'm fine, right?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.154
Yes. Do take care.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.698
Bukujutsu!!

13:56.878 --> 14:00.211
"Son Goku... has been killed.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.586
That might be a bit too much of a shock...

14:07.680 --> 14:10.092
"Er, I'm sorry to have to tell you

14:10.183 --> 14:15.723
that Goku has passed on to his eternal rest..."

14:15.813 --> 14:18.771
But then, he is coming back to life...

14:18.858 --> 14:21.600
That's it! I'll go with cheerful!

14:21.694 --> 14:24.561
"Uh, Goku is dead, but he'll be
coming back to life really soon,

14:24.656 --> 14:26.612
so there's nothing to worry about."

14:28.493 --> 14:30.484
Ah, Kuririn!

14:30.578 --> 14:33.285
H-H-Hello...

14:33.373 --> 14:36.115
What are you doin',
babblin' to yourself out here?

14:36.209 --> 14:41.624
Uh, well, er, y-you see...
a-allow me to offer...

14:41.714 --> 14:44.547
Hey there! Long time no see!

14:44.634 --> 14:48.752
Ah, hello! T-Thanks for saying so.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.508
I thought you were with
Goku-sa and the others.

14:51.599 --> 14:56.969
Ah, well, you see... t-the truth is, Goku d-d--

14:58.106 --> 15:01.519
d-d-d--

15:01.609 --> 15:03.145
What?

15:03.236 --> 15:08.401
"D-Don't worry about me," he says!

15:08.491 --> 15:12.234
Oh, so he's goin' to be late after all?

15:12.328 --> 15:16.822
Yeah! Yes. Actually,
Goku won't be coming back...

15:16.916 --> 15:18.201
You say he's not comin' back?

15:18.293 --> 15:20.955
No! He is coming back to us very soon...

15:21.045 --> 15:24.537
What are you sayin'?! I don't get it!

15:26.384 --> 15:29.000
Now, now, let's not stand out here talkin'.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.258
Come on in the house. Come on, come on.

15:43.026 --> 15:47.190
Would you wake up already, son of Son Goku?!

16:00.710 --> 16:03.417
We have to talk. Get out of the water.

16:07.008 --> 16:11.047
Who are you? Father?!

16:11.137 --> 16:13.753
Father! Where are you?!

16:13.848 --> 16:17.466
Father! Father!

16:18.603 --> 16:22.141
Father! I'm scared!

16:22.231 --> 16:24.222
Lousy brat!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.649
Don't give me any trouble!

16:34.327 --> 16:38.787
Stop blubbering! Be quiet,
or I will snap your neck!

16:40.083 --> 16:43.996
All right, listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

16:44.087 --> 16:48.126
First, your father is dead.

16:48.216 --> 16:53.085
You remember some of it, right?
He sacrificed himself

16:53.179 --> 16:55.465
in order to defeat that man.

16:59.519 --> 17:04.809
Piccolo! Hurry! Do that technique again!

17:11.196 --> 17:13.233
Do it!

17:13.324 --> 17:18.409
Take this! Makankosappo!!

17:32.969 --> 17:34.505
Father is...

17:34.595 --> 17:39.555
Whoa, don't cry! I really will snap your neck!

17:43.938 --> 17:47.351
You've heard about the Dragon
Balls from your father, right?

17:47.442 --> 17:51.685
Goku's friends are collecting
them now to bring him back to life.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.612
However, that's not what the matter is!

17:54.699 --> 17:58.112
We managed to get rid of
the guy that kidnapped you,

17:58.202 --> 17:59.942
but he said that in another year,
there are some friends of his,

18:00.037 --> 18:02.574
who are even stronger than he was,
who will be coming here.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.123
When they do, even with
Son Goku brought back to life,

18:06.210 --> 18:09.168
there isn't a chance of us
winning with just me and him.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.496
We need your strength, too.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.422
You're going to train to learn fighting tactics,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.010
and defend the Earth!

18:15.094 --> 18:20.680
Huh? Me? Nuh-uh. I can't fight at all.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.474
Apparently, you haven't realized it yourself,

18:27.064 --> 18:29.806
That's why you're going to
train to draw that power out,

18:29.901 --> 18:31.516
and become able to use it effectively.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.900
No way. I don't have that kind of power.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.697
You want to see some proof?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.650
What are you doing?!

18:40.745 --> 18:43.657
Wah! That hurts! That hurts! Stop it!

18:43.748 --> 18:46.865
That hurts! Stop it!

18:46.959 --> 18:51.248
That hurts! That hurts!

18:53.758 --> 18:56.875
Now, show me your inner power!

19:20.785 --> 19:22.867
W-What the...?

19:30.086 --> 19:34.375
A-Astonishing. It's greater than I imagined.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.054
I'm having mixed feelings.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.880
I'm about to raise someone

19:44.976 --> 19:48.935
who could become my
greatest enemy in the future.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.479
D-Did I do that?

19:52.567 --> 19:56.105
That's right. It looks like
you're starting to understand.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.483
Whenever your emotions
become substantially excited,

19:59.574 --> 20:01.940
you exhibit your intrinsic inner power.

20:02.034 --> 20:07.028
But it only happens for an instant.
We can't win that way.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.409
I'm going to beat the way to fight into you,

20:09.500 --> 20:12.412
and make you the ultimate warrior. Got it?

20:12.503 --> 20:16.872
But I don't want to become a martial artist.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.424
I want to be a great scholar.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.921
Go ahead, then.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.844
But do it after we defeat the two Saiyans

20:23.931 --> 20:26.513
that will be coming here in a year.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.889
They're planning to
exterminate everyone on Earth.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.220
If they do that, then there is no
future, or anything else, right?

20:32.315 --> 20:34.306
But I'm scared.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.689
Stop your whining! Do you
want to get killed right now?!

20:38.779 --> 20:41.816
We don't have time! We're starting right now!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.990
Take off your top!

20:46.412 --> 20:48.949
If my father is coming back to life,

20:49.040 --> 20:53.454
I want to be taught by him.

20:53.544 --> 20:57.128
Too bad. Sure, he may be strong,

20:57.214 --> 20:59.500
but he's not at all cut out to be a teacher.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.675
He has absolutely no sternness
when it comes to others.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.549
You can tell that just by
looking at how spoiled you are.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.380
Huh?

21:14.607 --> 21:19.727
Whoops. I used up too much of
my strength, and now I can't fly.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.812
Unaware of the cries of his son,

21:22.907 --> 21:29.779
Goku continues his long journey
in search of Kaio-sama's home.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.744
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.835 --> 21:39.329
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.423 --> 21:42.256
Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:42.343 --> 21:45.380
doko demo iku yo sokkou

21:45.471 --> 21:47.712
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.807 --> 21:51.140
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.227 --> 21:57.018
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.108 --> 22:03.195
kakegaenai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

22:04.573 --> 22:07.531
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:07.618 --> 22:10.781
Yabame no kono jidai

22:10.871 --> 22:16.491
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

22:16.585 --> 22:19.497
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:19.588 --> 22:22.716
Yaru n da furupawaa

22:22.800 --> 22:26.759
Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:26.846 --> 22:30.088
mirai shinjite

22:35.980 --> 22:38.096
I wonder how Gohan is doing right now.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.647
I'm lonely, Father!

22:40.735 --> 22:45.195
Huh? A full moon. I've never seen one before.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.193
Huh? Son Goku's son is growing larger!

22:48.284 --> 22:50.900
Is this the hidden strength of the Saiyans?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.656
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.747 --> 22:55.989
"Wilderness Survival!
A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan. "

22:56.083 --> 23:00.076
I wonder if! can really become a great scholar.
