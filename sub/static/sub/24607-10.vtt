WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.263
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.306 --> 00:03.786
RAVEN: ACCORDING TO SHAW,
THIS PLACE

00:03.829 --> 00:05.309
IS A CIVIL WAR
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.007
COME ON, MCCREARY.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.182
WE DIDN'T COME ALL
THE WAY BACK TO EARTH

00:08.225 --> 00:10.140
JUST TO KILL
EACH OTHER.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
TELL THEM THAT YOU
WERE PLANNING

00:11.881 --> 00:12.925
TO LET US DIE.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.623
OH!

00:14.666 --> 00:15.841
NO!

00:17.321 --> 00:19.149
OCTAVIA: THE HYDROFARM
IS BARELY FEEDING US NOW,

00:19.193 --> 00:21.934
SO IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

00:21.978 --> 00:23.675
THEN IT SHOULD BE OURS.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.677
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR
YOU TO SHARE THE VALLEY?

00:25.721 --> 00:27.810
DIYOZA, ON RADIO: SHORT OF
AN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,

00:27.853 --> 00:28.854
NOTHING.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.204
ARKADIA WILL
NEVER SURRENDER.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.901
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GONNA TAKE HER OUT.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.599
OMON GON OSON.

00:34.643 --> 00:35.861
BELLAMY...

00:37.167 --> 00:39.256
WE'LL BE IN THE VALLEY.
WE'LL HAVE PEACE.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.781
INDRA: THE CHILD WITH CLARKE
IS A REAL NATBLIDA.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.044
GIVE MADI THE FLAME.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.002
ASCENDE SUPERIUS.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.960
BELLAMY: MADI,
I HATE TO PUT THIS ON YOU.

00:48.004 --> 00:50.006
THIS IS HOW WE STOP THE WAR.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.225
AAH AAH!

00:51.268 --> 00:52.878
MILLER: STEP AWAY FROM
THE CHILD RIGHT NOW.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.880
ARREST THE TRAITORS.

00:54.924 --> 00:57.970
MADI: IF WE RUN, GAIA,
INDRA, AND BELLAMY WILL DIE.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.582
THEY MADE THEIR CHOICE.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.232
STOP! WERE YOU--

01:42.276 --> 01:44.539
-NO.
-MADI. MADI. MADI.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.715
GET AWAY FROM ME.
I'M GOING BACK.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.151
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.806
IT'S 50 MILES TO POLIS.
NOW GET DOWN FROM THERE.

01:50.849 --> 01:54.592
-AH!
-UH!

01:54.636 --> 01:55.854
LET GO OF ME.

01:55.898 --> 01:56.855
-MADI...
-UH!

01:56.899 --> 02:00.642
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OK?

02:00.685 --> 02:01.773
I SAID NO.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.427
THAT THING IS NOT
STAYING IN YOUR HEAD.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.863
YES, IT IS, AND IF
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT,

02:04.907 --> 02:06.082
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KILL ME.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.257
-MADI--

02:07.301 --> 02:08.737
YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET BELLAMY DIE

02:08.780 --> 02:09.999
AND INDRA AND GAIA.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.392
-GET IN THE ROVER.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.176
-NO! GET OFF!
-WE ARE NOT DOING THIS NOW.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.309
LET ME GO! STOP!

02:15.352 --> 02:19.182
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I NEED TO GO BACK.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.749
COMMANDERS
DON'T RUN AWAY.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.968
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT A COMMANDER.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.535
DAMN IT, MADI.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.972
I THOUGHT THE FLAME WAS
SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU WISE.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.322
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE THE CHILD

02:28.365 --> 02:29.845
WHO ATTACKED ME
IN THE WOODS.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.281
OCTAVIA WON'T
RUN AWAY,

02:31.325 --> 02:32.978
AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
SHE'LL GET HER WAR.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.242
WANT TO BET?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.636
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

02:38.680 --> 02:41.117
I'M GONNA TELL DIYOZA
THAT THE EYE IS DOWN.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.988
I'M GONNA TELL OCTAVIA
THAT SHE KNOWS.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.294
SHE CAN DECIDE
NOT TO MARCH

02:44.338 --> 02:46.078
OR MARCH
AND BE DESTROYED.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.993
EITHER WAY,
PROBLEM SOLVED.

02:48.037 --> 02:51.345
NOW GET IN.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.703
CLARKE, BE CAREFUL.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.579
THE WORMS.

03:11.713 --> 03:12.975
UH!

03:13.018 --> 03:14.281
TWO PROBLEMS SOLVED.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.673
NOW GET IN THE ROVER

03:15.717 --> 03:17.980
BEFORE I TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR ULTIMATUM.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.601
-NASH...
-YO.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.778
MCCREARY: CHECK EVERYTHING--
CRACKS IN THE FLOOR,

04:16.821 --> 04:18.475
THE MATTRESSES.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.173
JUNKIES CAN BE
VERY RESOURCEFUL.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.054
DIYOZA'S BOOK.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.935
YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, DOC.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.415
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.895
YOUR LUNGS, THEY'RE--

04:46.938 --> 04:49.941
I CAN HEAR THE FLUID
FILLING UP IN THEM.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.116
YEAH. YOU'RE DROWNING.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.509
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GETTING WET.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.990
WELL, FIX ME
AND GET YOUR FIX.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.298
HEH. NO.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.692
PLACE
IS CLEAN, BOSS.

05:01.736 --> 05:06.218
OH, I CAN SEE
THE CONVULSIONS COMING.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.177
HA!

05:08.220 --> 05:10.222
SHUT UP
AND GET OUT.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.138
GO FIND DIYOZA.

05:13.182 --> 05:16.228
YOU TWO,
GUARD THE DOOR.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.883
NO ONE GETS IN OR OUT.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.501
YOU KNEW
SHE'S PREGNANT.

05:30.155 --> 05:33.028
IT'S MINE.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.551
DID SHE
TELL YOU THAT?

05:34.595 --> 05:38.120
NO, BUT I CAN SEE WHY
SHE WOULDN'T BRAG ABOUT IT.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.644
DO IT.

05:40.688 --> 05:44.605
KILL ME LIKE YOU KILLED
THE OTHER DOCTOR.

05:44.648 --> 05:48.696
PUT US BOTH OUT
OF OUR MISERY.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.309
NO.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.182
I GOT
A BETTER IDEA,

05:57.226 --> 05:58.923
A CONTEST--

06:00.490 --> 06:04.276
YOUR DISEASE
VERSUS MINE.

06:05.713 --> 06:11.066
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'LL
BREAK BEFORE I DIE, DOC.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.647
MILLER: ALL THE RATIONS
HAVE BEEN PACKED.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.736
50% OF OUR PEOPLE WON'T MARCH.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.913
FEAR OF SANDSTORMS
HAS PUT A DENT IN MORALE.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.263
WE'RE LETTING IT BE KNOWN THAT
WE'RE TAKING THE LONG ROUTE

06:34.306 --> 06:35.395
TO AVOID THEM,
BUT--

06:35.438 --> 06:36.700
BRELL: DON'T BE
A COWARD, MILLER.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.310
IT'S NOT
THE SANDSTORMS.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.269
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.663
IT'S MADI.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.405
THE FACT THAT THERE'S
A SUPPOSED COMMANDER

06:45.448 --> 06:47.319
OUT THERE HAS
COMPLICATED THINGS.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.018
"COMPLICATED"?

06:50.061 --> 06:52.934
YOU JUST TOLD ME HALF OF OUR
PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO MARCH.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.762
I'D CALL THAT
MORE THAN COMPLICATED.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.459
MAYBE IF YOU HADN'T
TRIED TO KILL HER,

06:56.503 --> 06:58.722
-THE BELIEVERS WOULD--
-WE DON'T NEED THEM.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.073
EVEN AT HALF STRENGTH, WE
OUTNUMBER DIYOZA'S ARMY.

07:02.117 --> 07:05.686
STILL NOT ENOUGH,
NOT WITHOUT THE WORMS.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.427
MILLER: MAYBE,
MAYBE NOT,

07:07.470 --> 07:10.255
BUT WE STILL GOT
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.648
I SAY, WE GO
WIN THIS WAR,

07:11.692 --> 07:14.085
AND ONCE WE DO, THE REST
OF WONKRU, THEY'LL FOLLOW.

07:15.478 --> 07:19.003
IF YOU DISAGREE,
THEN SAY SO

07:19.047 --> 07:23.443
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ME.

07:23.486 --> 07:27.621
EITHER YOU'RE WONKRU,
OR AN ENEMY OF WONKRU.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.710
MY ADVICE--
YOU CAN EITHER UNITE US

07:29.753 --> 07:32.016
BEHIND THE REAL COMMANDER
OR REMIND THOSE

07:32.060 --> 07:34.758
WHO REFUSE TO MARCH WHAT
HAPPENS TO OUR ENEMIES.

07:34.802 --> 07:38.719
YOUR REAL COMMANDER'S A CHILD
WHO SHOWED UP YESTERDAY.

07:38.762 --> 07:42.113
BLODREINA'S KEPT US STRONG
THROUGH 6 YEARS OF HELL.

07:42.157 --> 07:45.421
NOW YOU'RE ADVISING HER
TO STAND DOWN

07:45.465 --> 07:46.466
OR KILL HALF OUR PEOPLE?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.163
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M ADVISING.

07:48.206 --> 07:51.296
IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
MADI'S GONE.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.647
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.779
CLARKE'S NOT
GONNA BRING HER BACK.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.348
SHE MEANS
THE FIGHTING PITS.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.915
YES.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.570
BRELL, THAT'S HER BROTHER
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:03.613 --> 08:07.965
AND INDRA AND GAIA.
I'M AWARE.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.880
I'M CONFUSED.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.013
YOU WANT ME TO KILL THE
PEOPLE WHO CONSPIRED

08:12.056 --> 08:14.581
TO BRING YOU BACK YOUR
PRECIOUS COMMANDER?

08:14.624 --> 08:17.322
NO. I WANT YOU TO
BEND THE KNEE TO HER,

08:17.366 --> 08:19.411
BUT I KNOW YOU WON'T.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.109
YOU WANT YOUR
ARMY TO MARCH?

08:21.152 --> 08:24.242
SHOW THEM WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THEY DON'T.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.393
OH, NOW,
THIS IS PERFECT.

08:44.436 --> 08:48.266
AND HERE, I THOUGHT THE TIME
OF THE COMMANDERS WAS OVER.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.662
IT WAS.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.146
NOW IT'S NOT.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.759
THE DAY YOU ASKED ME
TO BE YOUR SECOND

09:02.803 --> 09:05.762
WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

09:05.806 --> 09:09.592
DID I EVER
TELL YOU THAT?

09:09.636 --> 09:12.421
YOU ACCEPTED ME

09:12.464 --> 09:13.640
WHEN MY OWN
PEOPLE WOULDN'T.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.859
YOU GAVE ME THE STRENGTH
TO BE MORE

09:15.903 --> 09:17.600
THAN I EVER THOUGHT
I COULD BE.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.602
I GAVE YOU NOTHING.

09:19.646 --> 09:22.474
THAT STRENGTH
WAS ALREADY THERE.

09:22.518 --> 09:25.347
YOU BETRAYED ME,
INDRA.

09:25.390 --> 09:29.307
I BETRAYED
BLODREINA.

09:29.351 --> 09:32.049
WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

09:32.093 --> 09:35.705
OCTAVIA KOM SKAIKRU
WAS MY SECOND.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.360
I TAUGHT HER
WHEN TO ATTACK

09:38.403 --> 09:39.709
AND WHEN NOT TO.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.450
I ADVISED HER
TO DO WHAT'S BEST

09:41.493 --> 09:45.454
FOR HER PEOPLE,
NOT HERSELF.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.412
I AM WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY PEOPLE.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.589
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.291
THEY'RE REFUSING
TO MARCH, AREN'T THEY?

09:58.467 --> 10:00.121
YOU WOULDN'T
SURRENDER,

10:00.164 --> 10:01.905
AND YOU WON'T
GIVE UP THE THRONE

10:01.949 --> 10:03.777
TO THE RIGHTFUL
COMMANDER,

10:03.820 --> 10:05.735
SO NOW YOU'LL
USE FEAR

10:05.779 --> 10:08.869
TO BEND WONKRU
TO YOUR WILL.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.349
I SUPPOSE
IT WORKED BEFORE.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.961
WILL IT WORK NOW?

10:14.004 --> 10:21.621
IF I PUT YOU AND GAIA
AND BELLAMY IN THE ARENA...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.451
WILL THEY MARCH?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.628
PROBABLY,

10:28.671 --> 10:31.935
BUT YOU ALREADY
KNEW THAT.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.851
GIVE ME
ANOTHER OPTION...

10:36.636 --> 10:38.899
INDRA, PLEASE.

10:40.552 --> 10:43.207
THERE ISN'T ONE...

10:44.600 --> 10:46.776
BUT IF IT HELPS
TO CLARIFY THINGS,

10:46.820 --> 10:49.039
I PROMISE YOU,
IF YOU PUT US

10:49.083 --> 10:54.479
IN THE ARENA, I WON'T
BE LOSING A DAUGHTER.

10:54.523 --> 10:57.613
GAIA WILL WIN.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.095
I WILL HAVE HER
TAKE MY LIFE

11:01.138 --> 11:05.752
RIGHT AFTER I TAKE
YOUR BROTHER'S.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.584
VINSON...

11:55.627 --> 11:56.716
NO VISITORS.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.805
I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.198
WE NEED TO MONITOR MY PROGRESS
EVERY TWO HOURS

12:01.242 --> 12:04.898
TO MAKE SURE THE CURE
ACTUALLY WORKED.

12:04.941 --> 12:08.205
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK
YOU GENTLEMEN TO STEP ASIDE.

12:08.249 --> 12:12.079
ABBY: LET HIM IN
SO I CAN DO MY JOB.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.779
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT
ON THE TABLE.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.563
WE'LL HAVE TO THINK
OF A LESS SHOCKING WAY

12:18.607 --> 12:20.348
FOR YOU
TO CONTACT ME.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.394
I'M SORRY.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.832
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
DIYOZA, YOUR FRIEND KANE,

12:25.875 --> 12:27.964
AND MOST OF THE
DEFECTORS ARE SAFE.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.749
MCCREARY'S SENDING
PATROLS, BUT--

12:29.792 --> 12:32.577
OK. THAT'S NOT WHY
YOU'RE HERE, VINSON.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.189
OK.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.280
DEEP BREATH.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.587
MCCREARY TOOK MY PILLS.
I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.980
I CAN'T.

12:44.024 --> 12:47.027
I HATE TO SEE YOU
SUFFER, ABBY,

12:47.070 --> 12:48.463
BUT PERHAPS IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.073
NO, IT ISN'T.
MY BODY ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.381
I'M ALREADY
IN WITHDRAWAL.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.818
ANOTHER DEEP BREATH.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.777
IF MY BLOOD PRESSURE
GOES ANY HIGHER,

12:57.820 --> 13:00.910
I COULD HAVE
A SEIZURE.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.826
MY HEART COULD STOP.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.915
THEN TREAT MCCREARY.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.787
-ABSOLUTELY NOT.
-ABBY--

13:07.830 --> 13:09.701
NO. I SAID NO.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.268
EVERYTHING OK?

13:11.312 --> 13:12.574
ABBY: FINE.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.326
TELL ME
WHAT YOU NEED.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.551
I WROTE IT DOWN.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.991
ABBY: YOU'RE ALL SET.
YOUR LUNGS ARE CLEAR....

13:41.472 --> 13:44.388
AND I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN IN TWO HOURS.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.150
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WORKING ON A PLAN

14:07.194 --> 14:10.110
TO GET BELLAMY
OUT OF JAIL?

14:10.153 --> 14:11.981
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I HAD ONE?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.765
THEN I'D THROW YOU
IN THE PITS WITH HIM,

14:13.809 --> 14:17.682
AND INDRA WOULD
KILL YOU, TOO.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.772
I NEED YOU
TO GO SEE HIM.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.252
INDRA HAS
WEAKNESSES,

14:22.296 --> 14:23.863
AND IF BELLAMY
IS GONNA SURVIVE--

14:23.906 --> 14:25.777
YOU TELL HIM
YOURSELF

14:25.821 --> 14:28.084
OR, BETTER YET,
CALL IT OFF.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.913
YOU'RE A DICTATOR,
RIGHT?

14:30.957 --> 14:35.787
HE POISONED ME, MONTY,
WITH YOUR ALGAE,

14:35.831 --> 14:39.095
JUST ENOUGH SO
IT WOULDN'T KILL ME.

14:39.139 --> 14:42.577
I WONDER IF HE
HAD HELP WITH THAT.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.668
NOW, DO YOU WANT TO SAVE
HIS TREASONOUS ASS,

14:46.711 --> 14:48.713
OR DON'T YOU?

14:48.757 --> 14:51.107
BECAUSE,
FOR SOME REASON,

14:51.151 --> 14:52.848
I STILL DON'T WANT
MY BROTHER TO DIE.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.415
THEN DON'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.809
-YOU'RE THE DAMN--
-MONTY, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED YOU,

14:57.853 --> 14:59.811
BUT IF YOU CALL ME
A DICTATOR AGAIN--

14:59.855 --> 15:03.554
NOT THAT.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.253
THIS. LOOK.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.691
TWO DAYS AGO, THESE PLANTS
WERE ON LIFE SUPPORT.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.084
NOW LOOK AT THEM.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.608
IMAGINE WHAT THE ALGAE
CAN DO IN TWO WEEKS

15:13.651 --> 15:14.914
OR TWO MONTHS.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.090
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.961
COOPER'S FARM LOG SAYS,
THIS SECTION

15:19.005 --> 15:20.658
HASN'T BLOSSOMED
IN YEARS.

15:20.702 --> 15:24.401
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.230
A FLOWER.

15:27.274 --> 15:30.146
NOT JUST A FLOWER,
AN APPLE BLOSSOM,

15:30.190 --> 15:32.757
GHOST APPLE,
TO BE EXACT.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.150
FLOWERS BECOME FRUIT.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.978
THE PROTEIN CROPS
ARE REBOUNDING, TOO.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.588
OCTAVIA,
IF I'M RIGHT,

15:37.632 --> 15:39.982
I CAN DO THE SAME THING TO
THE TOPSOIL ON THE GROUND.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.941
IT'LL TAKE LONGER--
A FEW YEARS,

15:41.984 --> 15:43.333
MAYBE MORE--
BUT THE POINT IS,

15:43.377 --> 15:45.422
WE DON'T NEED
SHALLOW VALLEY.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.947
YOU DON'T NEED
TO MARCH TO WAR.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.471
BELLAMY DOESN'T
NEED TO DIE.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.085
HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

15:56.129 --> 15:57.782
IT'S A NICE STORY,
MONTY,

15:57.826 --> 15:59.697
BUT THE GHOSTS
CAN HAVE THIS PLACE.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.613
WE MARCH AS SOON AS
THE FIGHT IN THE PIT IS OVER.

16:02.657 --> 16:08.750
I WOULD LIKE MY BROTHER,
YOUR FRIEND, TO BE WITH US.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.230
LAST CHANCE.

16:10.273 --> 16:13.711
WILL YOU HELP ME
OR NOT?

16:16.584 --> 16:18.455
NO...

16:18.499 --> 16:22.503
NOT IF IT MEANS TAKING
MORE LIVES TO DO IT.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.643
OCTAVIA: MUST BE NICE,
PLAYING ADAM AND EVE

16:32.687 --> 16:34.819
IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN
WHILE THE REST OF US

16:34.863 --> 16:36.038
FIGHT TO SURVIVE.

16:36.082 --> 16:40.825
ACTUALLY, NO.
IT'S AWFUL.

16:40.869 --> 16:44.046
NOT AS AWFUL AS FIGHTING
A WAR YOU DON'T NEED TO FIGHT.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.093
YOU FIGHT TO LIVE,
OR YOU DIE.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.182
THAT IS HOW WE SURVIVED,

16:49.225 --> 16:52.272
EVEN WHEN THIS FARM
STOPPED FEEDING US.

16:52.315 --> 16:57.146
IF YOU WERE HERE,
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

16:57.190 --> 17:02.064
THE FARMERS WON'T
SAVE THE WORLD, MONTY.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.632
THE WARRIORS WILL.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.683
MADI: HUH! AH!
AAH! AAH!

17:12.727 --> 17:15.512
-NO! NO!

17:15.556 --> 17:18.385
-STOP! WAIT! NO, NO!
-HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.213
-NO. DON'T DO THIS!

17:20.256 --> 17:21.953
-I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
-TRY IT AGAIN, PLEASE.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.912
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.
I CAN SAVE YOU.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.524
-MADI.
-I CAN SAVE ALL OF YOU.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.004
-OH!
-NO!

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
-AAH!
-NO! NO!

17:31.093 --> 17:32.529
NO! STOP!

17:32.573 --> 17:33.965
BECCA: WITH MY SERUM,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE

17:34.009 --> 17:35.315
IN THE BUNKER ANYMORE!

17:35.358 --> 17:37.143
THE FLAME CAN
CHANGE EVERYTHING!

17:37.186 --> 17:38.883
-NO!
-HEY, WAKE UP.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.625
YOU THINK HE'S SAVING YOU,
BUT HE'S KILLING YOU.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.801
-AAH!
-AAH!

17:43.845 --> 17:45.716
-WAKE UP. PLEASE.
-NO!

17:45.760 --> 17:46.978
-AAH!
-AH!

17:49.938 --> 17:51.766
CLARKE.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.899
IT'S OK.
YOU'RE SAFE.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.076
THEY BURNED
HER ALIVE.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.166
BURNED WHO, HONEY?

18:00.209 --> 18:03.647
BECCA PRAMHEDA.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.998
I--I FELT HER.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.088
I WAS HER.

18:12.439 --> 18:16.095
THAT WASN'T A DREAM.
IT WAS A MEMORY.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.748
LISTEN TO ME.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.489
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS ANYMORE

18:19.533 --> 18:21.100
BECAUSE I CAN JUST
TAKE OUT THE FLAME.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.146
NO. I'D JUST
PUT IT BACK IN.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.802
YOU'D HAVE
TO DESTROY IT.

18:34.983 --> 18:38.508
IT'S OK.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.353
-HOLD ON.
-HA HA!

18:57.397 --> 18:59.399
UH! UH!

18:59.442 --> 19:01.401
-HA HA!
-AH...

19:01.444 --> 19:03.054
OH!

19:04.404 --> 19:06.014
HAA--

19:41.267 --> 19:43.094
REMEMBER LILY PADS?

19:45.009 --> 19:48.230
GOD, YOU USED TO
HATE THAT GAME...

19:49.666 --> 19:53.844
JUMPING FROM TABLE
TO CHAIR TO BED...

19:53.888 --> 19:57.718
FIRST ONE WHO TOUCHES
THE GROUND LOSES...

19:59.546 --> 20:01.504
BUT YOU NEVER ONCE
SAID NO,

20:01.548 --> 20:05.073
AND YOU ALWAYS
LET ME WIN.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.685
DO YOU REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME WE PLAYED?

20:08.729 --> 20:11.514
I CUT MY LIP.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.429
I BLED ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.822
I WAS SO WORRIED
THAT SOMEONE

20:14.865 --> 20:19.348
WOULD SEE IT ON
THE FLOOR AND FIND ME,

20:19.392 --> 20:22.221
BUT YOU TOOK CARE
OF THAT.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.529
YOU CUT YOUR
OWN ARM OPEN

20:26.573 --> 20:29.010
SO PEOPLE WOULD THINK
IT WAS YOUR BLOOD.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.538
LONG WAY FROM THAT
TO POISONING ME.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.802
NOT REALLY. NO.

20:38.846 --> 20:42.676
I DID THAT
TO SAVE YOU, TOO,

20:42.719 --> 20:45.896
FROM YOURSELF,

20:45.940 --> 20:48.551
FROM FIGHTING A WAR
THAT COULD DESTROY

20:48.595 --> 20:51.859
THE LAST SURVIVABLE
LAND ON EARTH.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.470
WELL, YOU'LL
BE HAPPY TO KNOW

20:54.514 --> 20:56.646
THAT THE WORMS
ARE GONE.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.432
CLARKE TOOK THEM
ALONG WITH THE USURPER

20:59.475 --> 21:02.217
YOU TRIED
TO REPLACE ME WITH.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.525
AND YOU'RE STILL
READY TO GO TO WAR,

21:05.568 --> 21:06.917
EVEN THOUGH INDRA
HAS TOLD YOU

21:06.961 --> 21:09.529
HOW MANY OF YOUR
PEOPLE WOULD DIE?

21:09.572 --> 21:10.834
WHAT KIND OF LEADER
DOES THAT?

21:10.878 --> 21:14.185
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.709
DON'T I?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.580
O., YOU TURNED THIS PLACE INTO
A STORY FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.148
I MEAN, THE RED QUEEN?

21:20.191 --> 21:23.499
IT'S A JOKE,
AND I CAN STILL TELL

21:23.543 --> 21:26.850
WHEN YOU'RE SCARED.

21:26.894 --> 21:30.463
I CAME HERE
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.640
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE
I SHOULD.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.556
WELL, THIS
SHOULD BE GOOD.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.948
INDRA HAS A WEAKNESS.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.602
HER SHOULDER NEVER
FULLY HEALED

21:39.646 --> 21:42.431
FROM THE BULLET
PIKE PUT IN HER

21:42.475 --> 21:45.347
THE LAST TIME YOU CHOSE
THE WRONG SIDE IN A WAR.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.785
SO YOU CAME HERE
TO HELP ME KILL THE WOMAN

21:48.829 --> 21:51.310
WHO MADE YOU
WHO YOU ARE.

21:51.353 --> 21:57.446
I LOVE INDRA--I DO--
BUT SHE'S NOT MY BLOOD.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.536
YOU ARE.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.233
NOW MAKE HER
TAKE THE HAMMER.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.061
IT'S TOO HEAVY TO WIELD
WITH ONE ARM.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.150
THAT MEANS YOU NEED
TO GET THE SWORD.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.501
OCTAVIA, WOULD YOU
LISTEN TO YOURSELF?

22:08.544 --> 22:09.850
GAIA WILL GO
FOR THE STAFF,

22:09.893 --> 22:11.068
AND YOU'LL WORRY
ABOUT HER

22:11.112 --> 22:12.635
AFTER YOU
TAKE OUT INDRA.

22:12.679 --> 22:16.552
TELL ME
YOU UNDERSTAND.

22:16.596 --> 22:19.642
I WISH I DID.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.818
I WISH I KNEW WHAT
MADE YOU THIS WAY,

22:21.862 --> 22:23.385
AND I WISH THAT
I COULD HAVE BEEN HERE

22:23.429 --> 22:27.824
TO TAKE THE BURDEN OFF YOU
THESE LAST 6 YEARS,

22:27.868 --> 22:30.827
BUT I'M HERE NOW,

22:30.871 --> 22:33.613
AND THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.223
YOU EITHER CALL
THIS THING OFF

22:35.266 --> 22:38.008
AND MAKE A DEAL
TO SHARE THE VALLEY,

22:38.052 --> 22:41.490
OR YOU WATCH ME DIE
IN THAT ARENA TODAY

22:41.534 --> 22:44.145
BECAUSE
I'M NOT FIGHTING.

22:46.626 --> 22:50.107
EVERYBODY FIGHTS.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.501
I WON'T.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.288
WE'LL SEE.

23:04.861 --> 23:08.256
THERE'S NO COMING BACK
FROM THIS, O.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.611
IF YOU DO THIS,

23:15.655 --> 23:18.353
THERE'S NO COMING BACK.

23:22.096 --> 23:25.316
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL
TRYING TO SAVE ME, BELL,

23:25.360 --> 23:29.973
BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE SOMEONE
WHO'S ALREADY DEAD.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.850
OH...

25:44.325 --> 25:45.195
MM!

25:45.239 --> 25:49.852
HEY, HEY, SHH.
WE'RE HOME.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.202
CLARKE.

25:55.728 --> 25:58.731
YOU DIDN'T
TAKE IT OUT.

25:58.774 --> 26:01.516
WHY?

26:03.300 --> 26:06.390
BECAUSE I CAN'T
DESTROY IT.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.352
YOU WERE CRYING
IN YOUR SLEEP.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.875
HAVE YOU SEEN
ENOUGH NOW TO KNOW

26:12.919 --> 26:15.008
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANYMORE?

26:15.051 --> 26:18.664
-YES...
-GOOD.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.884
BUT I HAVE TO.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.583
THE OTHER COMMANDERS
WANT ME TO SEE IT,

26:24.626 --> 26:25.975
TO FEEL IT.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.891
-THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
-LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

26:28.935 --> 26:31.024
YOU ARE MY CHILD,

26:31.067 --> 26:33.592
AND I WILL PROTECT YOU
WITH MY LIFE.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.246
FOR NOW, I'M LETTING YOU
KEEP THAT THING IN YOUR HEAD,

26:36.290 --> 26:39.423
BUT IF YOU SO MUCH AS THINK
ABOUT CHALLENGING OCTAVIA,

26:39.467 --> 26:41.730
I WILL TAKE IT OUT FASTER
THAN YOU CAN SAY, "ASCENDE--"

26:41.774 --> 26:43.819
-OK.
-GOOD.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.908
FINE, SO
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

26:45.952 --> 26:48.258
THE PLAN IS
TO STOP THE WAR.

26:48.302 --> 26:52.480
NOW LET'S GO
FIND DIYOZA.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.663
WHAT?

27:03.970 --> 27:06.581
DO YOU SEE HER, TOO?

27:06.625 --> 27:10.411
I KNOW IT'S WHY YOU'RE SCARED
OF ME HAVING THE FLAME.

27:14.284 --> 27:18.680
COMMANDERS DIE,
MADI, ALL OF THEM,

27:18.724 --> 27:20.551
BADLY.

27:22.902 --> 27:26.340
I WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN TO YOU.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.836
HEY, VINSON.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.580
NO LUCK, DOC.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.063
JUST KIDDING.

27:56.283 --> 27:59.852
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.421
MY PRESCRIPTION.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.032
ABBY: HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.555
HE NEEDS IT FOR
RESIDUAL SWELLING.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.862
YEAH, AND WHAT'S
IN THE OTHER HAND?

28:09.905 --> 28:11.515
SHOW US.

28:11.559 --> 28:15.171
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO NEED SOMETHING.

28:15.215 --> 28:18.958
UH! VINSON, WAIT!
AAGH!

28:19.001 --> 28:23.005
AAGH! PULL THE TRIGGER.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.051
-PULL THE TRIGGER.
-AHH...

28:25.094 --> 28:28.010
PULL IT. AAH!

28:28.054 --> 28:32.667
UH! OH! GET OFF ME! NO!

28:32.711 --> 28:33.668
GO AHEAD, DOC.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.801
I'LL CLEAN UP
WHEN I'M THROUGH.

28:35.844 --> 28:39.152
-ARGH!
-AAH! NO!

29:12.228 --> 29:13.664
WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.537
AFTER I TAKE BELLAMY'S LIFE,
I'M COMING FOR YOURS.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.758
WHEN YOU SEE MY GUARD
DIP, EXPOSING MY THROAT,

29:19.801 --> 29:21.455
YOU STRIKE.

29:21.498 --> 29:25.024
NO, MOTHER. THAT'S
NOT HOW THIS ENDS.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.113
GAIA, WE HAVE
TO GIVE THEM A SHOW.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.028
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH

29:29.071 --> 29:30.072
JUST TO BE THE LAST.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.944
I DON'T CARE
IF I'M THE LAST

29:31.987 --> 29:36.600
AS LONG AS MY
COMMANDER IS SAFE.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.951
NO.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.474
GAIA, LISTEN TO ME.

29:40.517 --> 29:44.043
YOU KILL OCTAVIA,
THE GUARDS KILL YOU.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.013
WHAT HAPPENS
IF WE DON'T FIGHT?

29:58.057 --> 29:59.754
IT'S BEEN TRIED.
YOU GET EXECUTED.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.845
GOOD, MEANS SHE'LL
HAVE TO DO IT HERSELF

30:03.889 --> 30:05.499
IF SHE CAN.

30:05.542 --> 30:08.067
AFTER ALL THIS,
YOU STILL THINK

30:08.110 --> 30:09.895
THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE HER BROTHER,

30:09.938 --> 30:11.766
SHE WON'T KILL YOU?

30:11.810 --> 30:12.854
I HAVE TO.

30:12.898 --> 30:16.510
LET'S HOPE WE DON'T
HAVE TO FIND OUT.

30:18.251 --> 30:19.905
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

30:19.948 --> 30:24.866
SHE MIGHT NOT
EXECUTE YOU OR ME, BUT GAIA?

30:25.954 --> 30:27.129
MAN: MOVE NOW.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.437
I'LL KILL YOU QUICKLY,
I PROMISE.

31:06.255 --> 31:09.476

31:09.519 --> 31:11.695
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.307
IF YOU CHOOSE SIDES
AGAINST US,

31:14.350 --> 31:17.876
IF YOU DIVIDE US,
IF YOU DEFY US,

31:17.919 --> 31:19.747
THEN YOU ARE NOT US.

31:19.790 --> 31:25.187
BEFORE WE GIVE THESE TRAITORS
A SECOND CHANCE

31:25.231 --> 31:29.409
TO BE CALLED...BROTHER...

31:30.323 --> 31:34.762
SISTER, OR SEDA,
WE PAY TRIBUTE

31:34.805 --> 31:38.897
TO THOSE WHO HAVE DIED
SO THAT WE MIGHT LIVE.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.814
CROWD: OMON GON OSON.

-AAH!

32:42.786 --> 32:45.702
NO!

33:11.598 --> 33:17.125
I SAID, BE THE LAST.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.524
MONTY: STOP!

33:24.567 --> 33:25.829
BELLAMY: MONTY,
GET OUT OF HERE.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.483
OCTAVIA: GUARDS,
TAKE HIM AWAY.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.094
MONTY: OCTAVIA TOLD YOU
WE HAVE TO MARCH,

33:29.137 --> 33:30.486
THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR THE ONE PLACE LEFT

33:30.530 --> 33:32.227
WHERE WE CAN SURVIVE,

33:32.271 --> 33:35.187
BUT SHE KNOWS
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:35.230 --> 33:37.798
MONTY, YOU DO NOT
BELONG IN HERE.

33:37.841 --> 33:42.933
THE HYDROFARM
IS WORKING AGAIN.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.587
SOON, IT'LL BE
PROCESSING ENOUGH FOOD

33:44.631 --> 33:47.547
TO FEED
ALL OF US HERE.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.462
USING THE SAME
TECHNIQUES,

33:49.505 --> 33:52.291
WE CAN GROW CROPS
IN THE WASTELAND.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.554
ASK OCTAVIA.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.164
SHE'S SEEN IT
WITH HER OWN EYES.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.340
MAN:
IS THAT TRUE?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.910
MONTY: GO TO WAR
IF YOU WANT TO,

34:02.953 --> 34:05.913
BUT AT LEAST TELL THEM
THAT THEY HAVE A CHOICE.

34:07.393 --> 34:10.222
IS THIS TRUE?

34:21.276 --> 34:25.063
CROWD: NOU BLODREINA NOWE!

-HA HA HA! HA HA!

35:46.666 --> 35:48.494
-WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.322
SHE DIDN'T SHOOT US, RIGHT?
THAT'S GOT TO MEAN SOMETHING.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.541
INDRA: IT MEANS SHE LOST
THE BATTLE, NOT THE WAR.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.282
WE SHOULD SPLIT UP,
BUT BE CAREFUL.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.631
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE
THAT WOULD

35:55.675 --> 35:57.198
GIVE THEIR LIVES
TO SAVE BLODREINA.

35:58.417 --> 36:01.333
-THE FIRE ALARM.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.597
THE HYDROFARM.

36:16.043 --> 36:18.915
MONTY: NO!

36:20.265 --> 36:24.094
-TOOK AWAY THE CHOICE.

36:24.138 --> 36:27.533
YOU STILL HAVE ONE--
STAY HERE AND DIE

36:27.576 --> 36:30.188
OR MARCH WITH ME
AND LIVE.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.810
MADI:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.682
WHY ARE WE GOING
THE LONG WAY?

36:46.726 --> 36:48.728
I'M GUESSING DIYOZA
SLEEPS IN HER SHIP.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.512
WE'RE GONNA COME UP
FROM BEHIND.

36:50.556 --> 36:51.948
SOON AS SHE SEE US,
SHE'LL KNOW

36:51.992 --> 36:54.037
HER EYE IN THE SKY
ISN'T WORKING.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.344
WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING
TO USE AS LEVERAGE

36:56.388 --> 36:58.216
SO SHE DOESN'T ATTACK.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.043
IT'S HOW BELLAMY
SAVED YOU THE MOMENT

37:00.087 --> 37:02.785
HE GOT BACK TO THE GROUND
AND GOT THE BUNKER OPEN.

37:02.829 --> 37:06.311
I MEAN, BY NOW,
HE'S PROBABLY DEAD.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.058
DO YOU REMEMBER NOW?

37:15.102 --> 37:18.758
COSSER: HOW CAN WE REMEMBER
WHAT WE NEVER KNEW?

37:18.801 --> 37:20.281
NASH: GUY'S GOT A POINT.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.719
-HOPE.
-I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.547
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.332
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE HIDING.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.855
PLEASE.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.684
UM, THEN YOU'RE
NO USE TO ME.

37:32.554 --> 37:33.990

37:34.034 --> 37:36.384

THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.742

37:58.450 --> 38:00.147

-I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIM.
-MADI, GET BEHIND ME.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.487
AND THE DOCTOR?
WHERE'S SHE?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.880
UH, GAS STATION.

38:37.924 --> 38:41.754
PLEASE, DON'T SHOOT ME.

39:18.878 --> 39:22.229
WAKE UP.

40:01.094 --> 40:05.751
WE GOT RATIONS HERE
FOR EVERYONE, 6 DAYS' WORTH.

40:05.794 --> 40:09.755
THAT'S ENOUGH

40:09.798 --> 40:11.713
MOVE OUT!

40:16.718 --> 40:19.634
