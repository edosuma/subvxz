It's 2:00 a.m.

like a firecracker.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.938
Her defenses were down.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.207
Some street punk with
a Glock 26 comes up
behind her.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.780
Three weeks she was laid up
in that hospital bed.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.782
She came through all right.

helpless in my life.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.069
Finding Mia Rochlan.

am I supposed to do then?

to the cabin,

the guys grab their rifles
and they head off
in the wilderness.

we hung around the cabin,
playing cards.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.386

was a crippled rabbit,

he picked up his rifle
and just... Bam.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.030
Shot her dead.

he shoots the baby too.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.084
I have what they call
an athletic gift
for investing.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.052
I'll turn you a sure-fire
profit before you've had time

38:41.086 --> 38:42.921
to take a sip
from your morning latte.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.155
Yeah, Jeff Price.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.025
You know, I bet your wife,
she likes
those commission checks.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.595
Is she home today?

38:49.628 --> 38:51.096
You know,
maybe we just go visit her.
What do you think?

38:52.364 --> 38:54.533
-California still got
that 50-50 on divorce?
-Yeah, I think so.

38:55.634 --> 38:59.538
WOMAN: (ON PHONE)
Line 2, Jerry. Line 2, Jerry!

38:59.571 --> 39:00.606
I'll call back.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.874
-Wait.
-Huh?

39:05.944 --> 39:08.079
My wife and I
have been together 25 years.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.716
I, um...

39:12.083 --> 39:14.386
I visit a massage parlor
from time to time.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.388
Let me make something
very clear to you, okay?

39:16.422 --> 39:19.725
I don't give a shit about your
extracurricular activities.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.694
All I wanna know is where
the car was parked.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.964
1901 Holloway Ave.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.534
Thank you.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.508
Someone a little paranoid?

39:37.142 --> 39:38.043
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:38.710 --> 39:41.112
Ethan Kelly bugged our phones
and our laptops.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.981
(LAUGHS) Right.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.753
Please tell me you're joking.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.021
-You're not joking.
-Mmm-mmm.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.023
Son of a bitch played me.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.459
Yeah, you and me both.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.863
He told me
that he was at the warehouse
when Oaks was killed.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.467
Whoever Oaks was working for,
they had him executed.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.101
Why not tell us this before?

40:03.134 --> 40:05.003
Because before
he didn't want my help.

40:05.671 --> 40:09.608
The only reason
they're keeping him alive
is so he can inform on us.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.042
So he wants to work together,

40:11.477 --> 40:12.778
tell them
what we want them to hear.

40:12.811 --> 40:13.879
And you believe him?

40:15.547 --> 40:16.748
I don't know.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.552
If he was spying on us,
why would he tell me?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.655
(SIGHS) When did he bug
the phones?

40:23.855 --> 40:24.956
Yesterday morning.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.792
Which means
they know about the chip.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.760
Which is why
they ransacked my house.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.597
Wait, you didn't
put it into evidence?

40:32.631 --> 40:34.466
I was having a friend at
Sun Valley Tech check it out.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.901
Oh, Jesus, Annou!

40:36.101 --> 40:37.636
Oaks was dirty.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.540
I had no idea
how deep this thing goes.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.874
And turns out I was right.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.143
Some fucking guy
from the FBI was here,

40:45.176 --> 40:48.113
asking if I found anything
when I went back
to Jameson's apartment.

40:48.580 --> 40:49.715
That's his job.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.017
I didn't tell anyone
I was going there.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.553
Shit.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.057
(SIGHS) You've broken
the chain of evidence.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.126
A One L could get
that chip excluded at trial.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.160
Look...

41:03.161 --> 41:05.030
If you want out of this,
I get it.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.634
(SIGHS)

41:16.041 --> 41:19.210
I have three brothers.
All older than me.

41:20.712 --> 41:24.115
Bobby teaches
medieval French literature
at King's College, Cambridge.

41:25.216 --> 41:28.687
Gordon's in the violin section
at the LA Philharmonic.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.791
Richard won two
National Book Awards
before he was 40.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.564
When I graduated
Harvard Law School, Dad said,

41:38.597 --> 41:41.066
"Well, three out of four
ain't bad."

41:42.968 --> 41:44.169
-That sucks.
-Hmm.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.574
You're not getting me off
this fucking thing.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.108
What's our next move?

41:51.242 --> 41:53.278
-Okay, I think we can find out
who made the chip.
-Okay.

42:02.588 --> 42:03.922
You'd think
Mr. Investment Genius

42:03.955 --> 42:05.657
would have picked
a classier joint.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.260
What?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.866
I'll follow you, shall I?

42:15.266 --> 42:16.267
Great.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.537
How's it going?

42:19.871 --> 42:21.172
How may I help you, gentlemen?

42:21.607 --> 42:23.709
Question for you.
The camera outside,
does it work?

42:23.742 --> 42:24.843
It does, my friend.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.612
Yeah? Any chance that we can
take a look at the footage?

42:27.112 --> 42:29.247
Of course. Everything in here
is for sale.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.049
PATRICK: Hmm.

42:31.683 --> 42:32.751
Pay him.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.153
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

42:37.889 --> 42:38.890
Detective Finnegan.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.226
We're working a case
involving the murder
of a federal officer.

42:41.259 --> 42:44.062
We would like access to
your security camera footage.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.131
Okay.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.999
Like I said,
everything's for sale.

42:48.199 --> 42:51.069
Did you hear what I just said?
This is police business.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.905
It's a federal
task force investigation.

42:54.105 --> 42:55.974
And that, my friend,
is a shield

42:56.007 --> 42:58.176
belonging to
the Chicago Police Department.

42:58.376 --> 43:01.279
You flashed it so briefly,
I know you were hoping
I wouldn't notice,

43:01.312 --> 43:04.015
but then you think
I'm a half-wit, don't you?

43:05.651 --> 43:07.285
So, gentlemen, like I said...

43:07.318 --> 43:09.320
Yeah, like you said,
everything is for sale.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.767
(SOFTLY) One more.

43:28.674 --> 43:29.675
(ETHAN CHUCKLES)

43:30.341 --> 43:31.677
One minute.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.085
(CLEARS THROAT)

43:46.224 --> 43:47.793
We never spoke, okay?

43:48.026 --> 43:49.294
I thought I was
the paranoid one.

43:53.364 --> 43:54.365
All right, what is it?

43:55.667 --> 43:58.203
As far as I can tell,
your chip measures
all kinds of biometrics.

43:58.236 --> 43:59.838
Chemical, physical...

44:00.071 --> 44:01.673
Much more than that,
I can't really say,

44:01.707 --> 44:03.341
but it could do a lot
more than just monitor.

44:03.374 --> 44:04.409
Like what?

44:06.377 --> 44:07.679
To be honest, I have no idea.

44:07.713 --> 44:10.081
I've read about
this kind of thing,
I've never seen it firsthand.

44:10.115 --> 44:12.083
Okay, you wanna make
an educated guess?

44:12.117 --> 44:13.819
Aside from measuring
brain function,

44:13.852 --> 44:16.755
some of the literature
predicts it could modify.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.123
Modify what?

44:19.090 --> 44:21.693
-What I... What I think?
-Think, feel...

44:23.428 --> 44:24.662
You're shitting me!

44:25.030 --> 44:26.064
Educated guess.

44:29.735 --> 44:30.769
Who made it?

44:30.802 --> 44:32.971
Parts of it are made by
several different companies.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.006
I could only pin down one,
the conductive gel.

44:35.306 --> 44:36.708
Kershan Chemical.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.209
Do you have a number?

44:38.243 --> 44:40.979
I already spoke
with them, Clea.
I didn't get anywhere.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.849
-I'm a cop, remember?
-Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna help.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.084
You know what they told me
when I called them up?

44:46.117 --> 44:47.452
They told me it's classified.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.321
As in
national security classified.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.224
Shit.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.399
-Stop right there.
-(CLICK)

45:06.972 --> 45:08.239
There's our guy.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.389
-Can you zoom in now?
-(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

45:35.300 --> 45:37.068
-There she is.
-Mmm.

45:38.203 --> 45:39.337
Who's the friend?

45:40.705 --> 45:42.373
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-You think that image
is gonna be good enough?

45:42.407 --> 45:43.441
It's a start.

45:47.545 --> 45:48.914
Hey.

45:48.947 --> 45:51.016
Tick-tock, Finnegan.
You got anything for me?

45:53.952 --> 45:55.821
No. You're right.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.289
-She's not here.
-Okay.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.291
Get your ass back here.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.175
Excuse me, can I help you?

46:18.076 --> 46:19.077
Um...

46:19.277 --> 46:21.112
Yeah, sorry to intrude,

46:21.379 --> 46:23.849
we're just a little hungry
and tired,

46:23.882 --> 46:24.983
and wondering if we could
get something to eat.

46:25.016 --> 46:27.185
-(STAMMERS) I think
I should call my son.
-Uh, ma'am,

46:27.218 --> 46:29.054
I would prefer if you stay
right where you are.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.222
We're really sorry about this.
No one's gonna hurt anybody.

46:31.256 --> 46:32.290
Is there anyone else
in the house?

46:32.323 --> 46:34.826
(STAMMERING) No one, uh,
just me.

46:36.527 --> 46:39.330
Please take whatever you want.
Just don't hurt me, please...

46:39.364 --> 46:41.499
How many times
do we have to tell you?
We are not here to rob you.

46:41.532 --> 46:42.934
Can you just shut up?

46:43.168 --> 46:45.236
Oh, I don't believe
this is happening.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.271
(GUNSHOT)

46:47.605 --> 46:48.907
(SCREAMING)

46:49.440 --> 46:50.575
Shut up.

46:50.608 --> 46:52.143
Shut up,
or so help me God, I'm...

46:52.177 --> 46:53.378
-That's enough!
-What are you doing?

46:53.411 --> 46:54.880
-We're leaving.
-She is a witness.

46:54.913 --> 46:56.114
-I don't care!
-Get out of my way, Sadie,

46:56.147 --> 46:57.482
or I swear to God,
I will shoot you, too.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.919
Go on, then.

47:00.952 --> 47:01.953
Sadie...

47:03.588 --> 47:05.056
Get out of the way!

47:05.290 --> 47:06.892
(GASPING)
