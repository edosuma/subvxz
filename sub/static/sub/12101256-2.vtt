00:01.175 --> 00:02.698
[Vanessa]
Previously onVan Helsing.

00:02.741 --> 00:05.570
The Dark One is through there,
find her, destroy the path.

00:06.397 --> 00:07.920
[both grunt]

00:07.964 --> 00:10.053
-[Jack] Where the hell are we?
-[Florian] Transylvania.

00:10.097 --> 00:13.361
The mysterious young woman
claims to be a vampire hunter.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.711
We must discover
who this woman is.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.801
[Dalibor]
Behold, Olivia Von Dracula.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.759
[Jack] Now I know
why my mother sent me here.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.413
The Dark One ends now!

00:22.457 --> 00:23.849

00:27.027 --> 00:28.854
[Sorina] No!

00:30.900 --> 00:33.772
[crowd shouting]

00:33.816 --> 00:35.948
-[man 1] Kill the witch!
-[man 2] Murderer!

00:35.992 --> 00:38.473
-[crowd clamoring]
-[man 2] Murderer!

00:38.516 --> 00:40.736
-[man 1] Kill the witch!
-[man 2] Kill her!

00:40.779 --> 00:42.738
[crowd shouting]

00:44.653 --> 00:46.698
[ominous music]

00:46.742 --> 00:47.786
Stay back!

00:48.570 --> 00:49.658
[Rasto] Go!

00:49.701 --> 00:51.703
See what you did?
Look at that!

00:51.747 --> 00:53.140
I should let them have you.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.750
[crowd clamoring]

00:54.793 --> 00:56.404
-Kill the witch!
-Burn her!

00:56.447 --> 00:58.536
[Jack] I saved them from an evil
they didn't see.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.192
Who is this assassin?
The other vampire hunter?

01:02.236 --> 01:05.326
The villager, Florian, believes
she emerged from the graveyard.

01:05.369 --> 01:08.807
Like a phantom
bathed in magic light.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.983
Florian! Florian,
you have to kill Michaela!

01:11.027 --> 01:13.899
-Florian,
you have to kill Michaela!
-[Rasto] Take her! Take her!

01:14.465 --> 01:15.684
Michaela?

01:17.381 --> 01:19.122
How could she know?

01:19.166 --> 01:22.212
-[man] Hang, you stupid witch!
-Florian, please!

01:22.256 --> 01:26.521
Florian! She's gonna try again!
She's gonna choose
somebody else!

01:26.564 --> 01:28.262
What does she mean, "try again"?

01:28.305 --> 01:31.003
-Try what?
-I do not know.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.876
This curious stranger will not
live for us to find out.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.052
Florian! She's a vampire!

01:36.096 --> 01:38.054
She's gonna choose
somebody else.

01:40.056 --> 01:43.320
You murdered their hope
and you broke my master's heart.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.017
-Florian! Please!
-You deserve this!

01:45.061 --> 01:47.803
-You deserve it!
-Florian! She's a vampire!

01:47.846 --> 01:49.413
[Jack] Florian, please!

01:49.457 --> 01:53.113
-Death to the witch! Kill her!
-Florian!

01:53.156 --> 01:54.636
[crowd clamoring]

01:54.679 --> 01:56.028
[suspenseful music]

01:56.072 --> 01:58.248
Yeah! Die, witch!

01:59.945 --> 02:01.164
[rope creaks]

02:01.208 --> 02:03.297
[crowd cheering]

02:04.515 --> 02:06.082
[shouts]

02:08.693 --> 02:11.870
[rope creaking]

02:12.915 --> 02:15.178
[theme music]

02:45.165 --> 02:48.080
[Michaela] We must act quickly.
The full moon approaches.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.604
Begin the preparations.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.650
But with
the vessel dead and gone,
how will we prevail?

02:52.694 --> 02:56.001
Life and death
are mere obstacles
on my path to greatness.

02:56.045 --> 03:02.094
But, Mother, we searched
centuries for a woman pure
of heart and soul,

03:02.138 --> 03:04.227
worthy of corruption
by the Dark One--

03:04.271 --> 03:08.623
[Michaela] There's still a way,
an ancient way seeped
in darkness.

03:08.666 --> 03:13.454
Sisters, gather fresh blood,
and in abundance.

03:13.497 --> 03:17.893
[Tattiana] But the villagers,
we were only taking them
one at a time.

03:17.936 --> 03:21.592
There is no time for discretion.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.727
Go.

03:29.818 --> 03:33.038
And you, find where they buried

03:33.082 --> 03:36.694
that piece of filth
that dared stand in my way.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.000
[Alexandra] I know where.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.785
[Michaela] You better be sure.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.180
She carried the mark
of bewitchment.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.662
Someone sent her here
to thwart me.

03:48.619 --> 03:49.707
Who?

03:50.926 --> 03:53.320
Why?

03:53.363 --> 03:56.236
Bring that wretched body to me
so that I might study the mark.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.063
Go!

04:01.502 --> 04:03.286
And, sisters,

04:03.330 --> 04:07.203
sever her head from her body
as soon as she is out
of her grave.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.249
We can take no more chances.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.035
[foreboding music]

04:16.995 --> 04:19.084
[Dalibor] I have avenged
your death, my love.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.436
That assassin...

04:24.394 --> 04:25.917
festers now

04:28.050 --> 04:31.183
in unsanctified ground,

04:31.227 --> 04:33.360
where she shall never find
any peace.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.233
[Michaela] It is time to prepare
the body.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
[foreboding music]

04:43.935 --> 04:45.807
[Dalibor] Prepare?

04:45.850 --> 04:48.288
[Michaela] For the funeral.

04:48.331 --> 04:51.291
Men do not know
of these practices
and should not.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.467
You must go.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.776
Who are you?

05:01.605 --> 05:02.737
Really?

05:03.520 --> 05:04.956
I saw you!

05:06.828 --> 05:07.916
Saw me?

05:09.483 --> 05:10.484
[exhales]

05:11.746 --> 05:13.225
The true me?

05:14.009 --> 05:15.053
Yes.

05:15.097 --> 05:20.015
Ah...
[laughing]

05:20.058 --> 05:23.671
But you must have had
some idea of my powers.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.543
What I called upon
to deliver you a son?

05:26.587 --> 05:28.415
You used tinctures.

05:28.458 --> 05:32.244
Yes, hand-crafted myself.

05:32.288 --> 05:38.163
So many innocent
lives sacrificed, their blood
boiled down to its essence

05:38.207 --> 05:41.079
and fed one drop at a time
to the Countess,

05:41.123 --> 05:43.168
to spark life in a dead womb.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.780
You killed
those missing villagers.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.608
At your command.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.436
-You wanted a son!
-No.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.438
You told me you did not care
at what cost.

05:51.481 --> 05:55.398
No, I-- I never knew.
I-- I did not know.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.139
-Did you not?
-No.

05:57.182 --> 06:01.622
Not even in the depths
of your soul?

06:07.497 --> 06:11.893
Ah, yes.
My accomplice after all.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.155
[sighs]

06:23.295 --> 06:26.473
[laughs]

06:26.516 --> 06:28.126
[rasping]

06:28.866 --> 06:30.302
-[thuds]
-[sighs]

06:30.346 --> 06:31.782
[thunder rumbling]

06:31.826 --> 06:32.957
[Tattiana] Grab her.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.571
[body thuds]

06:38.354 --> 06:40.835
[clinks]

06:40.878 --> 06:44.447
[Tattiana] Hm. This is what
the mother fears enough
to ask for her head.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.275
[thunder rumbling]

06:47.450 --> 06:48.451
[Tattiana] The axe.

06:52.673 --> 06:56.416
I would simply leave you to rot
if it were up to me.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.158
It's not.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.377
[Tattiana groans]

07:01.421 --> 07:03.858
Wait, Alexandra,
don't make me kill you.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.468
[hisses]

07:05.512 --> 07:06.774
-Aah!
-[body thuds]

07:06.817 --> 07:09.603
[Alexandra groaning]

07:09.646 --> 07:10.908
[Alexandra murmuring, hissing]

07:10.952 --> 07:11.996
[grunts]

07:14.085 --> 07:15.130
[Alexandra retches]

07:17.001 --> 07:19.700
[coughing]

07:20.527 --> 07:21.571
[exhales]

07:21.615 --> 07:22.616
But how?

07:25.314 --> 07:27.142
-Who are you?
-Go ask your brother.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.579
Go! Go!

07:30.711 --> 07:33.235
[hissing]

07:33.278 --> 07:35.193
Come closer and say that.

07:35.759 --> 07:36.891
[shouts]

07:40.677 --> 07:41.983
Bathory?

07:42.026 --> 07:44.681
You're alive
and you know my name.
How is this?

07:44.725 --> 07:47.075
You're not gonna live
long enough to find out.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.555
-[thuds]
-[Jack grunting]

07:48.598 --> 07:51.122
-Stop!
I do not wish to harm you.
-[clinks]

07:51.166 --> 07:52.254
Since when?

07:52.297 --> 07:54.952
-[squelches]
-[gasping]

07:54.996 --> 07:58.042
[foreboding music]

07:58.086 --> 08:02.351
Witch. Vampire.
Speak your truth.

08:02.394 --> 08:05.485
-What other reason have you
to try to take my life?
-You have no idea.

08:05.528 --> 08:09.053
How is it that you're alive
when I saw you hang
from the gallows?

08:09.097 --> 08:10.925
I'm pretty tough to keep down.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.277
[Bathory] And you heal.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.932
Damn right, I do.

08:17.975 --> 08:21.501
[both grunting]

08:23.503 --> 08:26.462
You need not kill me!
We wish for the same thing.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.247
You're not a vampire.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.336
I would burn myself alive
if I were.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.296
-I'm a vampire hunter.
-You hunt vampires?

08:34.339 --> 08:36.864
Like my mother before me
and her mother before her.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.039
It's what we do.

08:38.082 --> 08:41.564
-Wow. Seriously?
-You find this surprising?

08:42.522 --> 08:43.827
You could say that.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.656
You're not a vampire, either.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.963
There are more Sisterhood
searching these woods.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.051
It's not safe.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.444
We must go.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.013
Come! We have much to discuss.

09:02.890 --> 09:03.934
[sighs]

09:04.892 --> 09:07.459
I know you're in grief.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.636
Feeling betrayed, as do we all.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.680
[cup clinks]

09:13.161 --> 09:17.426
Thinking her a savior,
when she was a demon
in disguise.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.472
I should never have
believed her.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.649
I should have known
she was evil.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.737
Perhaps.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.393
But now, all our worries
are over.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.657
She's gone.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.094
And all the curse she
brought with her.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.923
-We can live in peace now.
-Yeah.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.535
[vampire screeches]

09:39.579 --> 09:42.799
-Come on! Everyone!
-[vampire hissing]

09:42.843 --> 09:44.801
Get your weapons to protect
the village!

09:48.283 --> 09:50.720
-Florian, come on!
-Yes, I'm coming! I'm coming!

09:51.591 --> 09:52.896
[vampire screeches]

10:01.862 --> 10:03.733
[banging on door]

10:03.777 --> 10:05.126
[villager] Get out of the way!

[body thuds]

10:20.010 --> 10:22.317
[panting]

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
Alexandra?

10:26.669 --> 10:29.672
How are you...
how are you human again?

10:29.716 --> 10:34.416
This strange woman,
she rose from her grave
and sent me back.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.984
-Jack?
-Yes.

10:37.027 --> 10:40.640
-She saved you.
-She saved me. My brother...

10:43.555 --> 10:45.993
Are you okay? Are you okay?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.910
[both chuckling]

10:51.738 --> 10:53.740
[insects chirping]

11:06.796 --> 11:08.798
[ominous music]

11:16.545 --> 11:19.853
No, do not touch that.
It's dangerous.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.079
Is that you in the painting?

11:30.298 --> 11:31.429
As a kid?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.694
And your mother?

11:34.737 --> 11:37.261
She taught me all I know.

11:37.305 --> 11:40.003
How to hunt vampires,
how to kill them.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.875
She was the greatest
of my people.

11:45.487 --> 11:48.316
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.667
I've lost much in this fight
against Michaela and her order.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.845
-She's a tough one to kill.
-How would you know?

11:57.238 --> 11:58.935
How are you a part
of all of this?

11:58.979 --> 12:02.852
You were never in the cards
and now you are everywhere.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.941
[tense music]

12:04.985 --> 12:05.986
Why?

12:07.770 --> 12:09.946
And what do you believe
Michaela is trying to do?

12:11.948 --> 12:13.036
Was trying.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.604
Past tense.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.259
Once Michaela is dead
too, it's over.

12:18.302 --> 12:23.568
The Dark One never rises.
Evil never reigns over anyone.

12:23.612 --> 12:26.267
These readings grow more ominous
with every turn.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.704
I do not think
we've conquered anything yet.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.055
So, I ask you, once again,

12:32.099 --> 12:35.972
who are you and what do you know
about this Dark One?

12:38.845 --> 12:41.369
[indistinct chatter]

12:44.851 --> 12:47.070
-[woman] Here, eat.
-Thank you.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.772
You can trust her.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.602
[scoffs]

13:01.476 --> 13:02.520
Yeah?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.696
Why's that?

13:04.740 --> 13:07.177
She wants nothing more
than to defeat the Sisterhood

13:07.221 --> 13:08.831
and avenge the death
of her mother.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.532
You know, I saw you
in the tavern.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.970
-You were spying on me.
-We see everything.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.236
Even you eyeing this.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.896
You know of it. What it means.

13:30.853 --> 13:31.941
Where'd you get it?

13:41.559 --> 13:43.170
Who are you really, Jack?

13:46.086 --> 13:50.394
I'm a vampire hunter,
like you... and her.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.268
So, where'd you get the amulet?

13:54.311 --> 13:56.009
Bathory.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.706
It belonged to her mother.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.143
Passed down through
the family for generations.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.581
You said you know what it means.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.713
What's it for?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.064
I'll leave Bathory to tell you.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.066
It's her legacy.

14:11.589 --> 14:15.463
You need your strength.
Eat. Then you must rest.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.775

[speaking Latin continues]

14:49.236 --> 14:52.761
No, no, no! No, please!
No, no, please!

14:54.632 --> 14:57.766
Michaela, please! Please!
Have pity.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.942
Sorina, how nice of you to come.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.903
Please, spare me. Please.

15:03.946 --> 15:08.559
But you would want to
help your mistress,
even in death, would you not?

15:08.603 --> 15:12.259
-Yes. Yes. Of course, but--
-Then help her.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.698
[Sorina gagging]

15:16.741 --> 15:18.787

[indistinct chanting]

15:39.764 --> 15:42.854
[speaks Latin]

15:44.726 --> 15:45.901
Kill them all!

-[people screaming]

[baby crying]

16:00.263 --> 16:01.395
Sorina?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.179
[baby crying]

16:09.533 --> 16:10.795
Sorina.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.065
-[crying continues]
-[woman shushing]

16:19.108 --> 16:20.327
Sorina.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.420
Sorina!

16:28.726 --> 16:31.555
Why won't the baby stop
crying, my love?

16:32.992 --> 16:36.473
I... I cannot calm him.

16:36.517 --> 16:40.303
There's... there's such a chill.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.829
Even... even here by the fire.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.136
Why does it not... not warm me?

16:47.180 --> 16:49.660
-[thunder rumbling]
-[baby crying]

16:53.925 --> 16:55.579
Hand Christoph to me.

16:58.147 --> 17:01.063
-This is a bad dream.
-[shushing]

17:02.543 --> 17:05.415
Remember, you... you are weary.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.592
Rest is what you need.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.858
Hand the child to me.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.296
Please hand the child
to me, please.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.341
[baby crying]

17:21.953 --> 17:27.133
When I wake, all will
be as it was, yes?

17:29.396 --> 17:30.875
I will be renewed.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.182
[baby crying]

17:51.766 --> 17:53.811
[tense music]

[approaching footsteps]

18:06.868 --> 18:08.913
[ominous music]

18:11.655 --> 18:14.049
You dare spy on your mother?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.051
[vampire] I came to tell you,

18:16.095 --> 18:20.751
Tattiana and Alexandra
never returned, and a grave
stands empty in the field.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.537
She still lives.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.627
-Find the woman they
hanged. Kill her!
-[gasps]

18:30.283 --> 18:31.327
[vampire gasps]

18:34.025 --> 18:35.070
[Dalibor] My wife.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.159
What have you done?

18:37.203 --> 18:39.944
She was dead and now she lives.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.992
You are a witch.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
A witch!

18:47.213 --> 18:50.216
Evil masquerading as a nun.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.000
I will burn you at the stake.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.741
You will do nothing.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.178
You brought your evil
to my village.

18:56.222 --> 18:59.921
To my castle, to my family!

18:59.964 --> 19:03.403
Do not act pure of heart.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.580
I know what you have done
in battle, dear Dalibor.

19:06.623 --> 19:11.280
In the name of peace
and harmony, you have spilled
just as much blood as I.

19:12.629 --> 19:15.371
It was you who invited
me into your home.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.765
It was me who gave you a family.

19:17.808 --> 19:22.073
A mistake that I will
rectify this day.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.729
I can only tolerate
this insolence so
long before I...

19:25.773 --> 19:26.991
Before what?

19:27.992 --> 19:29.733
Before my Sisterhood murders

19:29.777 --> 19:33.650
each and every one
of the peasants in your village.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.436
I know all too well
how much you care for them.

19:36.479 --> 19:39.656
Sickening how you dote
on such worthless sheep.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.180
You and your bride.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.273
I only wanted to make her happy.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.840
I wanted to give her
what she wanted most
in this world,

19:49.884 --> 19:52.452
but not-- not for this price!

19:52.495 --> 19:55.890
It's far too late for
that, Count Dalibor.

19:55.933 --> 19:59.981
This is the fate you have made,
willingly or not.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.768
Keep her safe from prying eyes.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.989
Your people already fear
what they do not understand.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.817
Were they to see Olivia now,

20:09.860 --> 20:13.212
it would be her
swinging from the gallows next.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.823

20:34.407 --> 20:36.626
-[woman in distance] No! Stop!
-Who is that?

20:36.670 --> 20:39.412

21:52.049 --> 21:54.008
Sorina!

21:54.051 --> 21:55.226

Ah...

21:57.751 --> 21:59.013
Michaela?

22:04.627 --> 22:05.802
Hello?

22:10.633 --> 22:11.765
Dalibor?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.363
[Olivia gasps]

22:46.452 --> 22:48.454
[tense music]

22:55.156 --> 22:56.200
[Olivia] No.

-[coffin creaks open]
-[groaning]

23:11.868 --> 23:13.348

23:24.533 --> 23:28.058

23:28.102 --> 23:30.278
-[Dalibor] Come with me.
-[gasps]

23:30.321 --> 23:32.759
Now.

23:32.802 --> 23:37.720
You must not be here.
No one can see you like this.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.853
[Olivia] What has become
of me, Dalibor?

23:41.071 --> 23:43.422
The light inside me is dying.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.252
How will I get it back?

23:53.649 --> 23:54.694
Dalibor...

23:56.304 --> 23:58.349
[suspenseful music]

24:05.661 --> 24:07.097
[music fades]

24:07.141 --> 24:09.230
-[dog barking]
-[bird screeches]

24:17.630 --> 24:18.631
[Bathory] Jack.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.417
-What is it?
-We must talk.

24:23.679 --> 24:24.680
Is something wrong?

24:28.858 --> 24:31.818
[Bathory] My people,
they are brave.

24:31.861 --> 24:34.429
They would march
into hell itself if
I asked them to.

24:35.648 --> 24:38.085
But I cannot ask
them to do this.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.783
It's vital that I
leave this place
before more lives are lost.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.177
You're running away?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.266
I thought you called yourself
a vampire hunter.

24:45.309 --> 24:48.922
I am also
the leader of my people.
I have them to think of as well.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.445
That's bullshit! You're scared!

24:50.489 --> 24:52.534
I'm terrified!

24:52.578 --> 24:55.015
-As you should be!
-I am scared, too.

24:55.058 --> 24:58.105
But there's
a big difference between being
scared and just running away.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.150
Look, sometimes
you have to stand up and fight.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.631
Sometimes you have
to face the truth.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.942
My mother, she gathered
knowledge of the darkness.

25:08.985 --> 25:12.902
Tapped into it. Into
its power and magic.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.904
She was trying to fight
darkness with darkness.

25:14.948 --> 25:18.081
-Yeah, and you lost
her in the battle.
-[Bathory] Worse.

25:18.125 --> 25:22.695
One day the darkness
entered her soul
and it could not be removed.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.827
She lost herself.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.047
She became vicious and violent.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.138
Her death was not
a peaceful one.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.705
My mother's in the battle, too.

25:33.488 --> 25:34.707
And you lost her.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.927
But I'll get her back.

25:37.971 --> 25:42.889
We can't all
return from the grave,
and I have read my fortune.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.631
There is nothing but darkness
here for me if we do this.

25:45.674 --> 25:49.156
The future can change, Bathory.
That's why I'm here.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.941
Together we can stop
the rise of the Dark One.

25:51.985 --> 25:55.728
There's no way
we can storm that castle
and get anywhere near Michaela.

25:57.947 --> 26:00.602
There's no future
in a death wish.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.126
I'm sorry, Jack.
I will not end as my mother did.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.177
[tense music]

26:16.575 --> 26:18.620
This is where you must stay.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.710
-You will be safe here.
-But what about the baby?

26:21.754 --> 26:24.713
-I must take care of him.
-No.

26:24.757 --> 26:28.674
No, I will care
and protect Christoph with
my life if it comes to that.

26:28.717 --> 26:29.718
But...

26:30.414 --> 26:31.459
But what of me?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.984
Will you still be my protector?

26:35.898 --> 26:37.160
My love?

26:42.513 --> 26:48.650
We said that we would be
in each other's hearts forever,

26:49.825 --> 26:51.174
until death.

26:53.002 --> 26:56.005
Is that not still so?

26:57.877 --> 26:59.356
Your heart no longer beats.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.185
I feel nothing.

27:02.229 --> 27:07.016
I am sorry for everything,
but you are not what you were.

27:07.060 --> 27:11.978
-You-- you know this to be true.
-My beloved Dalibor.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.414

27:35.262 --> 27:36.437
[Florian] Who is it?

27:40.223 --> 27:42.138
Speak up! Who is it?

27:42.182 --> 27:43.574
[Jack] It's me.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.795
-Jack.
-[door opens]

27:50.320 --> 27:52.279
Close the door before
somebody sees me.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.194
I'm not in the mood
to be hanged again.

27:58.502 --> 27:59.547
[sword clanks]

28:03.856 --> 28:05.161
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.294
I lied to you.

28:07.337 --> 28:10.166
-I get it.
-You killed Olivia.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.473
Even when you said
you would not.

28:12.516 --> 28:13.692
I had no choice.

28:15.389 --> 28:16.433
So you say.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.133
But still, I...

28:21.221 --> 28:23.702
I thank you for what you did.

28:24.441 --> 28:25.529
What I did?

28:27.967 --> 28:30.056
Hello, again.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.623
Your sister.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.713
Right.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.846
I'm sorry, it's just...

28:37.890 --> 28:39.282
there's been a lot going on.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.544
Where have you been?

28:42.546 --> 28:45.941
On a wild goose chase.
I thought I found us
an ally, but...

28:49.728 --> 28:51.207
-Wait.
-What is it?

28:54.036 --> 28:56.386
Why were you digging me up
in the first place?

28:57.605 --> 28:59.825
Michaela told us to.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.349
She wanted to see
that marking on your arm.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.437
She...

29:04.612 --> 29:06.483
she told us to take your head.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.096
-We've got to go.
-Now?

29:10.139 --> 29:13.055
The vampires attacked
us all last night!

29:13.099 --> 29:14.840
The Sisterhood's been attacking
the village?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.843
Yes. Yes, they are gathering
more blood.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.584
As much as we could find,
as fast as we could find it.

29:20.628 --> 29:24.284
-For what?
-The resurrection of Olivia.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.286
[foreboding music]

29:26.329 --> 29:28.288
[sighs]

29:28.331 --> 29:30.246
-When is the full moon?
-Tonight.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.641
Alexandra, I really need you

29:33.684 --> 29:35.686
-to come with me.
-No, no, no.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.558
We need to stay here
and defend the village!

29:37.601 --> 29:40.604
I know I betrayed
your trust, Florian,
but I really need her help.

29:40.648 --> 29:44.391
-For what?
-Florian, we have to try.

29:46.828 --> 29:47.916
Let's go.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.962
[suspenseful music]

29:57.273 --> 29:59.406
[Bathory] We must be
out of this forest by nightfall.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.583
I will do as you ask.
But are you certain
we can do no more?

30:02.626 --> 30:04.541
[Jack] Bathory!

30:04.585 --> 30:08.284
-Bathory! Hey, wait.
-I already gave you my answer.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.766
Michaela's gonna try
and raise the Dark One tonight.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.943
-How could you know this?
-Because of her.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.251
She was one of them.
Turned vampire and
in the Sisterhood.

30:18.294 --> 30:22.037
-But she's human.
-Yes, Jack turned me
back with a bite.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.561
It is true, I was one
of those monsters,

30:24.605 --> 30:26.433
but now I'm not.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.478
And you think
you can turn Michaela as well?

30:29.784 --> 30:31.786
-You're insane.
-Don't get me wrong,

30:31.830 --> 30:35.181
I'll kill her if I have
the chance, but either way,
the Dark One stays lost.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.661
Like I said, we can't get
anywhere near her
in that castle.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.228
How do you expect
to get close enough to bite her?

30:39.272 --> 30:40.360
With this.

30:40.403 --> 30:44.320
[foreboding music]

30:44.364 --> 30:47.019
[Jack] We have until
the full moon rises.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.369
Don't you think you owe it
to your mother to at least try?

30:54.635 --> 30:55.679
Mm-hmm.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.768
[suspenseful music]

31:02.512 --> 31:04.819
[Bathory] This place is as good
as any to lay in wait.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.606
You said the marking
on your arm will lure her.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.521
-How?
-Like this.

31:17.832 --> 31:18.877
[Jack groans]

31:31.019 --> 31:32.020
[groaning continues]

31:35.197 --> 31:36.851
Jack, what is this?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.287
[Jack panting]

31:44.554 --> 31:47.470
-I don't trust this evil.
-[Bathory] No.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.950
We let this unfold.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.300
Jack, come on. Jack!

31:52.388 --> 31:55.217
Big date? Let me guess with who.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.395
Ah...

32:01.310 --> 32:05.314
So, you know how to work
the marking on your arm.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.012
I'm a quick study.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.753
There's a lot I know
that you might find useful.

32:09.797 --> 32:13.235
-Essential, really.
-Like what?

32:13.279 --> 32:15.716
Like why you're gonna
fail tonight without my help.

32:15.759 --> 32:19.720
Your help?
Why would I possibly
need help from you?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.551
Still a couple hours left
'til the full moon.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.205
Let's have it out.

32:26.248 --> 32:30.426
Either I kill you,
or you get what you
need from me.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.776
I will squeeze the truth
from your wretched mouth

32:32.820 --> 32:35.170
before you have a chance
to raise your sword.

32:35.214 --> 32:36.955
[chuckles]

32:36.998 --> 32:39.827
Talk's cheap, Michaela.
Come find me and say that.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.186
[Jack gasping]

32:53.101 --> 32:54.363
Did you reach her?

32:55.538 --> 32:57.453
Yeah.

32:57.497 --> 33:00.021
-I'm pretty sure she's
gonna come.
-Go!

33:00.065 --> 33:01.414
[Bathory] Ready yourselves.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.638
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

33:09.465 --> 33:10.510
-Go.
-Okay.

33:10.553 --> 33:11.946
Wait for my signal.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.297
[suspenseful music]

33:23.479 --> 33:24.654
[Olivia] Dalibor!

33:26.395 --> 33:27.918
Dalibor!

33:27.962 --> 33:31.096
Dali, you cannot leave me
in here alone!

33:32.619 --> 33:34.186
Dali!

33:35.187 --> 33:36.188
[sighs]

33:42.194 --> 33:44.544
[breathing heavily]

34:02.779 --> 34:05.956
[baby crying in distance]

34:07.175 --> 34:08.394
Christoph.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.615
Christoph.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.532
No, please. I cannot...

34:16.576 --> 34:19.622
I cannot bear your crying.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.537
[baby crying in distance]

34:21.581 --> 34:23.017
[sobbing]
Please.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.150
[gasps]

34:25.193 --> 34:27.108
Please...

34:27.152 --> 34:29.023
Oh, there has...

34:29.067 --> 34:30.938
There has to be...

34:30.981 --> 34:33.506
there has to be a
way out of here.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.551
There has to be another way.

34:35.595 --> 34:36.639
[exhales]

34:41.905 --> 34:44.169
[foreboding music]

34:52.351 --> 34:53.352
[sighs]

34:57.573 --> 34:58.705
[mutters]

35:00.446 --> 35:06.321
You should not be here.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.931
[baby crying in distance]

35:12.022 --> 35:13.415
Christoph.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.767
-[screams]
-[shatters]

35:17.811 --> 35:19.073
Where are you?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.686
[ominous music]

35:26.515 --> 35:27.864
Bathory, now!

35:30.563 --> 35:32.608
Ah, Bathory.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.001
[Michaela chuckles]
Of course.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.526
So, you've linked forces
with that filth.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.616
And you thought you could
defeat me with her by your side?

35:40.660 --> 35:43.228
Bathory! Now!

35:43.271 --> 35:44.707
[Michaela] How foolish.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.710
You truly believed
that she would fight
by your side,

35:47.754 --> 35:50.800
for goodness and light,
for all of humanity?

35:50.844 --> 35:53.716
You obviously have not known
the woman long.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.804
[Jack screams]

35:56.502 --> 35:58.243
[Jack groans]

35:58.286 --> 36:00.027
[laughing]

36:03.422 --> 36:08.166
Now, tell me this vital secret
you thought I should know.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.863
Let me whisper it in your ear.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.649
[laughing]

36:14.476 --> 36:16.957
[grunting]

36:20.352 --> 36:21.875
Stop where you are.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.661
-Stop, I say!
-[Jack grunting]

36:29.752 --> 36:31.014
Get away from me!

36:31.058 --> 36:34.235
I'd love to, when I'm done!

36:34.279 --> 36:35.889
[both grunting]

36:37.673 --> 36:40.633
[coughing]

36:40.676 --> 36:41.764
[gasps]

36:43.375 --> 36:44.593
I did it.

36:45.681 --> 36:46.639
It's over.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.207
[laughing]

36:50.295 --> 36:52.732
[laughing continues]

36:54.124 --> 36:56.344
No. No. Why aren't you turning?

36:56.388 --> 36:58.433
[laughing]

36:58.477 --> 37:00.435
[Jack] What's happening?

37:00.479 --> 37:04.483
You thought you could beat me
with your useless bite.

37:04.526 --> 37:05.571
[gasps]

37:07.225 --> 37:08.835
[panting]

37:08.878 --> 37:10.228
What's happening?

37:10.271 --> 37:13.405
Now you can assist me
in raising the Dark One.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.582
No.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.367
-Always room for another sister.
-[Jack groaning]

37:19.411 --> 37:22.631
No, no, no!

37:22.675 --> 37:24.459
[gasping]

37:24.503 --> 37:26.722
-[Bathory] No, Jack.
-No.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.246
Jack, no.

37:29.551 --> 37:30.900
Get away.

37:30.944 --> 37:34.339
-Jack! Jack, come back!
-[Jack panting]

37:34.382 --> 37:37.472
Jack, what was that?
What just happened to you?

37:44.827 --> 37:46.133
I don't know, I...

37:46.742 --> 37:48.004
Oh, god.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.923
-Oh, no.
-What?

37:58.493 --> 38:00.756
-Why didn't you attack her?
-Attack who?

38:02.454 --> 38:06.240
-Shit! She wasn't here?
-Here?

38:06.284 --> 38:09.939
-This was all an illusion. Fuck!
-What was?

38:09.983 --> 38:12.812
I was trying to trick Michaela,
but she tricked me!

38:18.905 --> 38:20.863
[Jack] We have to get
to the castle.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.648
There's no time.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.519
Come on. There's no time!

38:24.563 --> 38:25.651
Come on!

38:29.307 --> 38:31.265
They thought they could stop me.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.702
A woman with a marking
and a damned Roma?

38:33.746 --> 38:35.748
They will never stop me!

38:37.271 --> 38:40.013
[Michaela] Go, prepare.
It's time.

38:40.056 --> 38:44.278
-Father is here.
-[Michaela] All will be mine!

38:44.322 --> 38:48.674
-[baby cooing]
-Shh.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.461
[approaching footsteps]

38:53.505 --> 38:54.506
[sighs]

38:57.117 --> 38:59.249
[door opens]

38:59.293 --> 39:01.295
My blood no longer flows.

39:02.252 --> 39:06.866
Oh, dearest. Look at you.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.738
And on the most important day
of your life.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.306
You no longer own
your own destiny.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.787
It is time.

39:14.830 --> 39:18.399
-Time to meet your fate.
-No.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.184
-[Olivia] Never.
-Yes. Yes, you will.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.797
Dalibor. Rasto.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.016
The Dark Spirit awaits you.

39:29.149 --> 39:32.239
No. No.

39:32.282 --> 39:37.636
You feel that emptiness
where your spirit has made way?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.595
Let me fill it for you.

Come, my dear. Your
fate awaits you.

[thunder rumbling]

40:06.491 --> 40:09.407
-Shh. All will be well soon.
-No, no, no.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.932
Dalibor. My child.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.021
All of that is behind you now.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.719
That life is dead and gone.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.939
[thunder rumbling]

40:19.982 --> 40:21.984
[foreboding music]

Summon the spirit!

40:24.683 --> 40:26.293
[swords rasping]

40:26.336 --> 40:27.860
[Olivia] Why are you doing this?

40:27.903 --> 40:29.035
[vampires snarling]

40:32.778 --> 40:34.432
[Olivia] Someone help me.

40:36.782 --> 40:37.826
