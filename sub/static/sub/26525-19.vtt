WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.177
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.220 --> 00:06.136
I'm so sorry
I couldn't be the keeper
of the Sacred Symbols, Father.

00:06.180 --> 00:10.053
H'ronmeer gave us
the Symbols in the heart of
the desert of T'ozz.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.750
I could return them there.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.145
This is more than PTSD.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.104
We have to talk to Lena.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.062
Our great nation
was attacked by Supergirl.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.282
I am hereby
enacting martial law.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.674
And, Supergirl,
if you are watching,

00:22.718 --> 00:25.068
you are now
public enemy number one.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.202
I am doing
more harm than good right now.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.464
What do they say?

00:29.507 --> 00:31.509
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.555
Maybe even mightier
than a cape.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.225
- Go home, alien!

00:51.268 --> 00:52.835
It's after dark.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.315
Open the door, alien!

00:56.012 --> 00:56.969
What was that?

00:57.013 --> 00:58.928
-Supergirl?

00:58.971 --> 01:00.147
Howdy, boys.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.801
-Who are you?
-I'm your worst nightmare.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.201
Sweet dreams.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.376
Get out of there, Dreamer.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.074
The DEO van is headed your way

01:14.117 --> 01:16.250
and this place
is about to be swarming
with Lockwood's men.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.525
We are only
days into martial law

01:30.568 --> 01:33.223
and already people are
catching wind of you.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.007
We must be strategic.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.750
-Brainy, are you
worried about me?
-Yes.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.405
The repeal of Alien Amnesty
has left us all vulnerable.

01:41.449 --> 01:45.975
Ben Lockwood is out there
rounding up aliens he believes
have anti-human leanings.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.586
And masked vigilantes
are target number one.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.502
Well, someone has to
protect innocent people.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.549
With Supergirl lying low,
we have to pick up the cape.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.509
You know, you could
always blue-green up

01:58.553 --> 01:59.815
and join me out there.

01:59.858 --> 02:02.470
Without Supergirl,
there's a 63.6% chance

02:02.513 --> 02:04.646
that you and I
will be apprehended.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.605
-If we are not smart
and careful that--

02:07.649 --> 02:10.086
If you'll excuse me...
Ah! Ah!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.653
Seriously?

02:11.696 --> 02:13.698
You were a hologram
the whole time?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.178
We'll have to
continue this spat later.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.701
-Wait!
-Ah! Ah!

02:21.837 --> 02:24.579
Heartrate is 186.
His ICP at 22 mil,

02:24.622 --> 02:27.234
and his BP is 160 over 30
and rising.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.323
EKG now erratic.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.933
Pardon me
for stating the obvious,

02:30.976 --> 02:33.675
but I do not believe
the extraction process
is working.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.764
You're pulling plasma,
not Harun-El,

02:35.807 --> 02:38.114
and you're exacerbating
his symptoms.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.507
It's okay.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.378
Keep going.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.347
Oh, God... Okay...
I'm fine.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.131
I'm sorry.
I thought this would work.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.220
I took this AmerTek technology
straight from Lex's cell

02:57.264 --> 03:00.223
and I followed
the instruction plans
from Eve's lab exactly.

03:00.267 --> 03:05.228
In the interest of science,
was that super hearing
you just experienced?

03:05.272 --> 03:06.838
Super-hearing now, too?

03:06.882 --> 03:09.798
It seems every panic attack
is bringing out a new ability.

03:09.841 --> 03:13.802
I will fix this. I just...
need to better understand this.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.633
That's gonna take time.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.939
-We need another strategy.
-Yeah.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.942
Well, luckily for James,
I am adept at strategies.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.511
Have you ever heard
of a mind palace?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.047
James...

03:42.091 --> 03:44.876
Here's the black budget
you asked for.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.793
As discussed, everything is in
order and above board. Eve.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.626
Shoot.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.742
Edna, if you get caught
changing alien
personnel records,

04:24.786 --> 04:27.441
AmerTek might do
more than just fire you.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.138
Just be careful.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.836
Were you just
talking to someone
that works at AmerTek?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275
My sister.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.841
Well, I'm working on an article

04:36.885 --> 04:39.017
to expose Lex Luthor
and I know
AmerTek was involved.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.324
Do you think your sister
would be willing to talk to me?

04:41.368 --> 04:42.891
I don't know. It's--

04:42.934 --> 04:45.241
Franklin, did you sleep here?

04:48.940 --> 04:52.248
Lockwood and his men
raided the building
across the street from mine.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.032
I am so sorry.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.470
Me too.

04:56.513 --> 05:00.517
But that is why
this is so important
for us to put a stop to.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.910
Have your sister call me?

05:02.476 --> 05:03.825
Thanks, Franklin.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.785
-Kara?
-Huh?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.875
Franklin is afraid to go home.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.530
Don't you think that maybe...

05:13.574 --> 05:15.097
it's time for you
to rejoin the Super friends?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.621
Nia, don't you think
I wish I could?

05:17.665 --> 05:19.971
But look what people
are saying.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.234
Exposing Lex is the only way
I can help right now,

05:22.278 --> 05:24.976
and when I do,
it will clear Supergirl's name

05:25.020 --> 05:27.544
and I can get back out there
with you and help people.

05:27.588 --> 05:31.069
Okay. No, you're right.
You stay on Lex.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.856
But I'm gonna
watch the streets.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.207
Someone needs to make Lockwood
go nighty-night-night.

05:38.250 --> 05:42.124
A mind palace
is a hyper-real interactive
space in James' mind.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.693
This device taps into
James' temporal lobe,

05:45.736 --> 05:47.738
allowing me
to map out his memories.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.872
Everything he experiences
will be real and true.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.788
If James is able
to identify and face
his core trauma,

05:53.831 --> 05:55.790
he may be able
to manage the attacks.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.140
Do we know why the Harun-El
is making the attacks worse?

05:58.183 --> 05:59.968
Lena's drug was designed
to attack illness.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.405
In this case,
it was focused on the PTSD,

06:02.449 --> 06:05.321
heightening what would
normally be
just a panic attack.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.150
And since the drug
also gives you superpowers,

06:08.193 --> 06:10.805
the attacks
were causing the powers
to be uncontrollable.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.111
So, you're saying
even if I'm able
to manage the symptoms,

06:13.155 --> 06:14.939
I'm still
gonna have superpowers?

06:14.983 --> 06:16.419
Yes.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.986
But you'll be able
to control them.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.076
Now, shall we jump in?

06:22.207 --> 06:23.165
Let's do this.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.386
-Let's go!
- He's not
a anti-human conspirator.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.910
-Let's go.
-He didn't do anything.
He's innocent.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.043
Open the door.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.220
Please. He's a good man.

06:35.264 --> 06:38.789
If he were a man,
we wouldn't be
in this situation now.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.922
Don't make a scene.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.141
Your children,
they just lost their father.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.362
I would hate to see them
lose their mother, too.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.154
Um... They look so human, I...

06:56.807 --> 06:57.982
Sometimes I forget.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.549
Yeah, it's a lot easier

06:59.593 --> 07:03.553
when there's a snake coming out
of the back of their head.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.989
We can't humanize them, son.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.645
So, remember,
don't ever mistake them

07:08.689 --> 07:12.867
for anything
but the roaches that they are.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.913
Hey, Marcus,
you come over here
for a second?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.786
Excellent work.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.963
So, would you...
I was thinking
maybe you could take George

07:22.006 --> 07:23.399
along for
the rest of your shift.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.663
He's still gaining a stomach
for what we're doing.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.057
Great. Let's go.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.763
Thank you. Have a good one.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.246
Oh, my purse!
Stop! Help!

07:46.422 --> 07:47.858
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:47.902 --> 07:51.035
I am such a klutz.
I feel so bad.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.082
I'm sorry.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.999
-Kara Danvers?
I'm Franklin's sister.
-Edna?

07:58.782 --> 08:01.176
Things at AmerTek are bad.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.091
Really bad.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.532
I even heard a rumor

08:09.576 --> 08:12.753
they're installing
alien detection devices
on the entrances next week.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.494
Has AmerTek done business

08:14.537 --> 08:17.627
with Lex Luthor
or any of his associates
in the past 18 months?

08:17.671 --> 08:18.846
I'm in HR.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.239
Can you get me access
to those records?

08:22.632 --> 08:26.244
Look, I want these guys
taken down.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.072
But they are
rounding up aliens.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.771
And my actions
could put my friends
and family in danger.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.077
Edna, I know
it's scary right now,

08:33.121 --> 08:36.254
but Franklin told me
how brave you've been.

08:36.298 --> 08:39.519
Taking the personnel files
of the aliens in your office.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.695
What's happening is wrong.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.348
But the only way we can stop it

08:43.392 --> 08:46.526
is by exposing
the people that are
committing these crimes.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.486
Can you help me?

08:56.884 --> 08:59.713
Hey, thank you for being here.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.366
It means a lot.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.238
Oh, there's no place
I would rather be.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.068
There is an 86.7% chance

09:07.111 --> 09:10.114
that your core trauma
has something to do
with Lex Luthor.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.377
So, we shall start
by exploring that region.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.554
Are we all ready to begin?

09:18.819 --> 09:19.863
Good.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.923
I'm at the Daily Planet?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.578
Welcome to level one.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.190
This is right after
I met Superman.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.409
The first time
Lex kidnapped me.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.205
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

09:57.248 --> 10:00.861
This is... Something wrong.
This is not
how it happened that day.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.124
The memories are folding in
on one another.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.216
Who are they?
Who are you?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.092
Brainy, what is
going on in there?

10:22.273 --> 10:23.274
That's me.

10:38.594 --> 10:39.639
What happened?

10:41.292 --> 10:42.598
I saw Dad.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.472
How much longer
is this gonna take?

10:47.516 --> 10:48.560
Not long.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.533
A military base
in Rubniu?

11:05.142 --> 11:07.449
Who's Sebastian Melmoth?

11:07.492 --> 11:11.322
I researched
all the AmerTek executives.
I never saw his name.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.934
You're in HR.
Could you get me
his employment records?

11:13.977 --> 11:16.719
Those servers require
my personal PIN number.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.155
They'd know it was me.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.418
Someone's coming.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.159
Is there
a light on in the records room?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.508
No one's
requested access today.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.250
-We have to hide.
- Hey, who's in there?

11:32.126 --> 11:34.998
The door's frozen shut.
Must be an HVAC problem.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.826
I'll get maintenance
to open the door.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.830
Hey... It's okay, it's okay.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
I'm sorry.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.051
But you don't know
what it's like

11:44.094 --> 11:45.792
to walk around
with a target on your back

11:45.835 --> 11:47.402
just because of what you are.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.798
I can't go on the record.
I can't do this.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.725
Begin Harun-El
extraction trial 7.5.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.031
Object is at 180 BPM,

12:08.075 --> 12:10.251
device is set to 350 megahertz.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.821
Mark five. Tumors emerging.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.214
Heart volume expanding to 30%.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.364
By George,
I think we've got it.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.670
We just stumbled upon
your core trauma, James.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.761
And surprisingly, it isn't
a Lex Luthor murder attempt.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.372
It's your father's death.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.765
Brainy, you said

12:45.808 --> 12:48.680
that whatever I saw
in your mind palace

12:48.724 --> 12:50.900
was gonna be
based on real memories.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.903
I wasn't
at our father's funeral.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.777
Yes. You were.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.169
Incontrovertibly.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.867
No, Brainy, he wasn't.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.260
I was alone.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.480
That is not something
you forget.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.222
Consider the possibility
that James was there,

13:08.265 --> 13:10.790
and you, Kelly,
did not see him.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.230
I was across the street.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.146
At a diner.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.800
I got locked in the bathroom
and nobody could hear me.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.628
By the time the manager
opened up the door,

13:23.672 --> 13:24.804
his funeral...

13:26.153 --> 13:28.720
His funeral was over.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.680
Perhaps that is merely
a picture of the truth

13:31.723 --> 13:33.595
that got framed
and hung in your mind.

13:33.638 --> 13:37.294
An excuse you invented
that over time,
even you came to believe.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.428
The mind will play tricks
to protect itself.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.996
Think of memories
like a watercolor.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.562
While you're painting,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.303
the colors
blend into each other
without clear borders

13:46.347 --> 13:47.304
until they grow opaque.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.871
Once the painting dries,

13:48.915 --> 13:51.700
-the picture is set.
-Yeah, I'm sorry,
I need a break.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.575
Was it my metaphor?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.061
Hey. Uh...

14:05.105 --> 14:08.238
Look, I know how hard it is
to see a sibling in pain.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.892
But you... You have to know

14:09.936 --> 14:13.069
that Brainy and I
are not gonna let
anything happen to James.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.245
It's... It's not that.

14:15.289 --> 14:19.032
The memories
are triggering for me.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.555
You mean
James at your dad's funeral?

14:20.598 --> 14:23.558
James wasn't
at the funeral, Alex.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.434
I was eight.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.743
And it was
the worst day of my life.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.225
My dad was dead.

14:38.268 --> 14:42.533
And my mom was so distraught
that my aunts
had to hold her up.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.234
I was scared
that she was gonna die, too.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.585
James swore to me
that he would be by my side.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.329
That everything
was gonna be okay

14:55.372 --> 14:57.766
because we were gonna
face it together.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.640
He disappeared
before the service.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.383
And I sat there,

15:08.298 --> 15:09.734
alone,

15:11.736 --> 15:13.869
tears streaming down my face,

15:13.913 --> 15:16.219
staring at the door,
waiting for my big brother

15:16.263 --> 15:18.656
to walk in
and make everything...

15:19.570 --> 15:21.616
Make everything okay.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.489
He never showed up.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.883
Where was he?

15:27.927 --> 15:28.884
I don't know.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.280
I don't know
where he really was.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.717
And, look, I get it.
He was a kid, too.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.416
But it is not a day
that I am aching to relive.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.507
I understand.

15:45.727 --> 15:50.340
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.342
We're really good
at taking care of other people

15:52.386 --> 15:54.997
but not so good
at taking care of ourselves.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.174
You don't have to do this.

15:58.218 --> 16:01.569
Yeah, I can stay
by James' side for you.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.355
I, um...

16:06.574 --> 16:09.011
I actually...
I think I can do it.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.884
Thank you.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.019
Sebastian Melmoth.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.023
Who are you?

16:21.067 --> 16:26.550
Why were you buying property
in the non-existent land
of Rubniu in October?

16:48.224 --> 16:49.051
Lena.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.013
- Hello?

16:55.057 --> 16:55.927
Kara?

16:57.059 --> 16:58.234
What a surprise.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.584
Yeah, your new assistant
let me in.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.413
She seems nice.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.676
Let's hope she doesn't
stab me in the back.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.853
Lena, I'm so sorry
about what Eve did to you.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.464
Thanks.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.380
It's actually why I'm here.
Uh...

17:13.423 --> 17:15.643
I'm writing
an article about Lex.

17:16.426 --> 17:17.993
I wanna expose him.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.041
I want to take him down
and put an end to all of this.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.216
An expose on Lex.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.870
That's quite an Everest.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.788
Uh, there was
actually something
I was hoping you could answer.

17:31.659 --> 17:35.097
Has L-Corp done business
with AmerTek?

17:35.141 --> 17:37.273
Maybe on a military project?

17:37.317 --> 17:39.058
No, of course not.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.237
Look, I'm sorry I can't
help you with this right now.
I'm...

17:45.455 --> 17:47.066
I'm trying to help James.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.679
You know, Alex is here.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.291
You haven't been around.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.945
Supergirl's been there for me.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.730
Person who judges me
on the very premise
of my last name

17:59.774 --> 18:01.689
but my best friend hasn't.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.170
Lena, I'm...

18:05.171 --> 18:06.911
I'm sorry. I was...

18:07.869 --> 18:10.480
I was trying to catch Lex.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.353
For you.
That's why I'm doing this.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.529
Of course
I care about how you feel.

18:15.572 --> 18:20.273
You just care about me
a little less than you do
as a source for your story.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.492
No, no, it's not like that.
I...

18:22.536 --> 18:25.191
I wish I could explain,
but...

18:29.717 --> 18:32.198
But maybe it's better
if I just go.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.294
In there,
before someone sees.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.785
Isn't it past your bedtime?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.707
What's going on here?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.927
Al's letting us use
the bar as an alien refuge.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.756
I don't know
how to make my bed.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.801
Can you help me, please?

19:15.197 --> 19:18.113
Alien Affairs.
You're all in violation
and under arrest.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.419
What do you mean,
"under arrest"?

19:19.462 --> 19:20.985
We haven't done nothing wrong.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.727
Under martial law,
aliens cannot gather
after curfew.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.164
Get them to the van.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.992
You're gonna have to
go through this reverie first.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.864
-Have it your way.

19:34.782 --> 19:35.739
Get out of here.

19:35.783 --> 19:36.827
Get 'em!

19:38.786 --> 19:39.961
I got the kid.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.578
-Charlie?
-George.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.232
Please don't take me in.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.756
You're an alien?
Why didn't you tell me?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.280
Why do you think?

20:21.611 --> 20:23.047
Fall back!

20:29.097 --> 20:30.925
-You're safe now.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.187
Safe?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.190
They didn't get us today,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.191
but they'll be back.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.149
We're aliens.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.455
Nowhere is safe.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.427
I know that
crease in your brow.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.907
Sweetie, tell me what's wrong.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.259
It... It's just...

21:03.305 --> 21:07.440
Do you ever wonder
about, um... Like...

21:07.483 --> 21:09.268
Dad's policies?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.967
You know, like,
maybe we're doing this wrong?

21:13.010 --> 21:15.143
Of course not, George.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.841
Your dad
is saving this country.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.888
And the raid at the bar
didn't go as planned,

21:20.931 --> 21:23.586
but you helped
smoke those roaches
out of their hole

21:23.630 --> 21:26.372
and your father
is so proud of you.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.206
Nia...

21:37.296 --> 21:38.384
What is it?

21:38.427 --> 21:39.907
Al's dive bar.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.868
He's been using it
as a shelter for aliens

21:44.912 --> 21:47.393
and Lockwood's goons
just crashed it.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.787
I stopped them.
But...

21:53.268 --> 21:55.923
The people there
still felt so hopeless.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.187
And I wanna
do more to help them.
I just

21:59.230 --> 22:02.843
don't know what else I can do.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.412
I know exactly how you feel.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.545
I've been so myopic
I think I've made things worse.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.289
I made Franklin's sister
more afraid.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.638
Not to mention

22:15.682 --> 22:18.032
I've been
a terrible friend to Lena.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.774
Uh-- How have you been
a terrible friend?

22:20.817 --> 22:23.646
You've been lockstep
ever since Lex escaped.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.169
That was Supergirl.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.215
Right.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.350
God, it just sucks out there.

22:32.525 --> 22:35.528
I wish we could do your
Aliens of National City story

22:35.571 --> 22:37.443
with every alien.

22:37.486 --> 22:41.098
Then the humans would know
that they don't
need to be afraid of them.

22:41.142 --> 22:45.189
Maybe they just need
to get to know one alien.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.409
How do you mean?

22:47.453 --> 22:50.107
Nia... Nia!

22:50.151 --> 22:53.328
You and I have been so focused
on fighting and reporting,

22:53.372 --> 22:56.897
that maybe... maybe we forgot
the most important part
of being a hero

22:56.940 --> 22:59.116
is inspiring hope.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
So, Supergirl's coming back?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.034
The world doesn't need to hear
from Supergirl right now.

23:04.078 --> 23:08.952
They need a hero
who can speak to the conflict
society is struggling with.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.955
Someone who is both
alien and human.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.654
Someone who can
bring them together.

23:14.697 --> 23:17.221
-How?
-I wanna interview you.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.745
An exclusive.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.095
I want to introduce the world

23:22.226 --> 23:23.402
to Dreamer.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.363
I know this is
challenging, James,

23:28.407 --> 23:30.670
but I'll be with you
every step of the way.

23:36.545 --> 23:40.331
-It's the day of the funeral.
-Looks like you're early.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.335
I remember wearing that suit.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.469
I love you, Dad.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.862
I promise

23:48.905 --> 23:50.429
I will spend my life

23:50.907 --> 23:52.561
making you proud.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.128
You can't be in here.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.086
The funeral hasn't started yet.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.090
There he is.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.049
We've been waiting for you,
daddy's boy.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.052
I remember them.
Billy New and Brandon Palmer.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.968
They taunted me,
took my lunch money.

24:08.011 --> 24:11.145
My dad was a soldier.
Have some respect.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.409
Let's say
we show him some respect.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.633
Let me go!

24:21.982 --> 24:23.244
Stop!

24:24.114 --> 24:25.464
Don't do it. Don't do this.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.644
His vitals are spiking.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.474
-Push through the memory.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.174
My connection's lost.
I can't reach him.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.306
Kelly,

24:42.350 --> 24:44.526
I fear James' mind
has merged with
his younger self.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.963
You were there.
You could tether him.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.574
Will you go in?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.880
No. No, no, no.
I can't.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.970
He needs guidance.
He will recognize you
as his young sister.

24:54.014 --> 24:57.713
No, Brainy,
it's too much to ask of her.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.498
There has to be another way.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.416
I'll do it.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.333
James, please,
can you let me in?

25:12.075 --> 25:15.818
- James?
- Kelly, I can hear you.

25:15.862 --> 25:19.343
You gotta get me out of here.
I can't see this.

25:19.866 --> 25:20.823
I'm here.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.260
James, I'm here with you.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.393
- Wait, that's you?

25:26.220 --> 25:28.048
You weren't at the diner?

25:30.050 --> 25:32.269
You were trapped down here?

25:34.837 --> 25:37.013
Those boys did this to you?

25:37.057 --> 25:38.232
James?

25:38.275 --> 25:41.148
James, where are you?

25:41.191 --> 25:43.063
Oh, my God, that's my voice.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.587
Down here, Kelly. Help!

25:45.631 --> 25:47.415
I was looking for you.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.853
Dead daddy
can't save you.
You think your baby sister can?

25:50.897 --> 25:53.464
-Pathetic loser.

25:53.508 --> 25:56.076
I must have
pushed the shame of this

25:56.990 --> 25:59.383
and the memory so far down,

26:01.734 --> 26:03.474
I forgot.

26:03.518 --> 26:07.435
I've told that diner story
so many times,
I believe it.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.269
I wanted to be there, Kelly.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.315
I wanted to be...

26:18.968 --> 26:21.275
I'm so sorry.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.495
I'm so sorry.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.194
It's okay.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.763
It's not your fault.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.767
You can change this narrative.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.640
Fight back.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.665
Come on.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.731
James, you did it.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.653
You're gonna be great.

27:35.871 --> 27:36.698
You ready?

27:37.351 --> 27:39.396
As I'll ever be.

27:40.789 --> 27:41.790
Okay.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.368
I haven't figured out
the extraction yet, Brainy.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.283
That's why I came up.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.502
Urgency is no longer required.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.418
James has successfully
completed his mind palace.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.898
With his trauma unblocked,

28:02.942 --> 28:04.508
the Harun-El seems to have
stopped attacking his PTSD

28:04.552 --> 28:06.772
and is regulated
throughout his body.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.905
His long-term prognosis
with your drug in his system

28:10.776 --> 28:11.820
is good.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.519
Good evening.

28:15.563 --> 28:18.087
This is Kara Danvers
with CatCo Media

28:18.131 --> 28:20.568
and this is
a worldwide exclusive.

28:20.611 --> 28:24.398
I'm here with the hero
who has been
fighting in the shadows.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.487
This is Dreamer.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.837
My first question...

28:29.795 --> 28:30.883
Who are you?

28:30.926 --> 28:32.754
I'm Dreamer

28:32.798 --> 28:36.410
and I am a descendant
of a daughter of Naltor.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.412
When did you
come here from Naltor?

28:38.455 --> 28:39.500
I didn't.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.415
I was born here in America.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.025
-I grew up...
-Shut this off.

28:43.069 --> 28:44.853
We can't.
Someone hacked the system.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.594
...humans and aliens
lived together in harmony.

28:46.637 --> 28:50.337
My mother was Naltorian,
but my father was a human.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.253
So you are
both human and alien.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.950
Yes.

28:54.994 --> 28:58.954
My parents believed
that humans and aliens
could co-exist.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.956
And I'm living proof of that.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.392
But growing up wasn't easy.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.786
I am also a trans woman.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.571
I'm different, Miss Danvers,
but so is everybody.

29:07.615 --> 29:11.532
And I don't know
when that became
such a bad thing.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.361
The greatest gift
we can give each other

29:14.404 --> 29:17.712
is our authentic selves
and sharing that.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.803
Sharing our truth
is what will make us strong.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.587
So, here I am.

29:23.631 --> 29:26.808
I am both human and alien.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.680
And I am a trans woman.

29:29.724 --> 29:32.292
S'mores are
my favorite dessert.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.686
But I will always choose
salty over sweet.

29:35.730 --> 29:40.256
I broke my nose when I was 15
during a game of kickball.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.128
My mother was my heart.

29:43.564 --> 29:46.393
And since I lost her,

29:46.436 --> 29:49.091
it's felt like
a piece of me is missing.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.138
But my father is my spine.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.836
I'm a Gryffindor.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.839
Uh, my patronus
is a Dapple Grey Stallion.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.188
I am an INFP.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.886
Uh, a Miranda.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.061
House Stark.

30:02.104 --> 30:06.892
I love Thursdays
and April.

30:06.935 --> 30:12.071
-And nerdy boys
who think too much.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.682
And I am proud
of all that I am.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.119
You should be.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.600
What does love feel like?

30:19.643 --> 30:22.777
Are you afraid
of how the world
will react to you

30:22.821 --> 30:24.692
now that
they know you're an alien?

30:25.345 --> 30:26.650
Of course.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.871
But, you know what else?
Fear sucks.

30:29.915 --> 30:34.833
It sucks.
And I am so sick
of feeling hopeless.

30:35.746 --> 30:38.967
Dawn doesn't come
unless we want it to.

30:40.360 --> 30:43.406
But we don't have to wait
for a new day.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.148
We are the new day.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.113
Your mother
would be so proud of you.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.075
Oh, my...

31:01.250 --> 31:02.164
You're leaking.

31:04.471 --> 31:07.866
I always considered
myself strong, brave. But...

31:10.477 --> 31:13.784
To share yourself
like that, I...

31:13.828 --> 31:15.830
If I am understanding
Dreamer's words correctly,

31:15.874 --> 31:18.789
none of us should be afraid
of who we are.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.922
Nor should we fear
sharing that.

31:22.445 --> 31:26.928
I feel so paralyzed right now
because I'm not able to. I'm...

31:27.668 --> 31:29.583
Not able to move forward.

31:29.626 --> 31:33.152
I can't find Lex.
I can't fix James.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.155
I understand

31:36.851 --> 31:39.854
that you have been betrayed

31:40.637 --> 31:42.683
by many people
in your life, Lena.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.903
I know that feeling, too.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.297
But if you want to be
trusted and accepted,

31:48.341 --> 31:50.952
then you must also trust.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.301
It will be risky.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.522
But I can tell you
that if you close all doors,

31:55.565 --> 31:59.178
you will have
a 99.9% chance of sorrow.

32:02.007 --> 32:05.097
I want this Dreamer detained.
Now.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.142
Let's go.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.107
I can't get a hold of Kara.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.326
Lockwood is heading to CatCo.
I gotta get her and Dreamer
out of there.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.808
Wait, you're gonna be
court-martialed if
you try to stop Lockwood.

32:20.851 --> 32:23.767
They cannot catch us
if they cannot see us.

32:24.681 --> 32:25.726
So, tell me later.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.686
-Okay...
-Great job, guys.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.340
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Franklin.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.516
Alien Affairs! On the ground!

32:33.560 --> 32:35.388
Don't you move!

32:35.431 --> 32:38.565
Dreamer, you are under arrest

32:38.608 --> 32:41.698
for using
an illegal seditious broadcast

32:41.742 --> 32:43.396
to incite violence.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.920
You're the only one
inciting violence.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.052
We're unarmed.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.315
This will be easy, then.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.056
Ready, Brainy.

32:58.585 --> 33:02.197
Where is she?
Find her and detain her.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.579
You're here.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.364
As a wise woman once said,

33:38.407 --> 33:39.713
"Fear sucks."

33:40.496 --> 33:42.368
So let's kick fear's ass.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.074
Franklin, you saved me!

33:53.118 --> 33:55.294
-I did?
-Yeah. Let's take cover.

33:55.337 --> 33:56.860
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah.

34:08.481 --> 34:11.832
We should get out of here.
Getting caught also sucks.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.792
Dreamer!

34:16.358 --> 34:17.577
You're coming with me.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.411
Get out of CatCo.

34:25.976 --> 34:26.890
Now.

34:27.978 --> 34:32.026
Not without the alien.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.246
What alien?

34:34.289 --> 34:37.684
All I see are journalists
exercising their right
to freedom of speech

34:37.727 --> 34:41.079
and doing their duty
to uphold freedom of press.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.429
So, unless you're gonna
rewrite the Constitution,

34:44.212 --> 34:46.997
get out now!

34:49.739 --> 34:51.959
I don't know
what happened to you

34:52.002 --> 34:53.439
or how you did this.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.181
But I'll find out.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.879
Come on!

35:01.664 --> 35:04.232
Oh, and I will find

35:05.494 --> 35:07.496
this Dreamer.

35:17.332 --> 35:18.855
Kara?

35:18.899 --> 35:22.337
-Edna?
-I saw the Dreamer broadcast
last night.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.124
It was inspiring.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.170
I realized you were right.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.520
The only way we can stop
any of this

35:31.564 --> 35:33.870
is by exposing these people.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.090
I have something for you.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.266
I thought
maybe these could help.

35:42.314 --> 35:45.621
These are
the acquisition papers
for that military base.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.580
But they'll know it was you.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.538
What about your job?

35:49.582 --> 35:51.410
I don't care.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.761
In fact, if you need
an AmerTek whistle-blower,

35:54.804 --> 35:56.850
I'm willing
to go on the record.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.548
This...

36:00.680 --> 36:02.508
is very brave of you.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.380
You ready, sis?

36:08.992 --> 36:10.472
Thank you, Edna.

36:11.647 --> 36:12.953
Truly.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.799
I'm sorry I was
so short with you.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.844
You were just trying
to do your job.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.238
Friendship is
the most important job

36:37.282 --> 36:39.675
and I was so focused
on my article,

36:39.719 --> 36:42.374
I forgot what really matters.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.636
No, Kara.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.160
The truth is,

36:46.204 --> 36:48.423
even if you'd been standing
right next to me
when Lex escaped

36:48.467 --> 36:51.774
I really wouldn't have
let you be there for me.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.472
What do you mean? Why?

36:55.909 --> 36:58.303
Because I'm the one
that's keeping secrets.

37:01.523 --> 37:05.527
Eve wasn't the only one
working with Lex. I...

37:09.270 --> 37:12.404
I was working with him, too.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.233
He contacted me
four months ago.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.714
He knew I had the Harun-El.

37:18.758 --> 37:22.631
He had cancer
and he was afraid to die.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.285
He's my brother.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.377
And in my heart,
I knew he was manipulating me

37:29.421 --> 37:32.206
but I believed him

37:33.860 --> 37:36.602
and I helped him
and he betrayed me.

37:38.343 --> 37:42.738
And I was weak
and I will never
forgive myself for that.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.570
I can only imagine
what you think of me, Kara.
I don't blame you.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.006
No, no.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.183
You are not weak.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.273
You are a brilliant,

37:56.012 --> 37:58.972
kind-hearted, beautiful soul.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.452
Your brother asked you for help

38:00.495 --> 38:03.803
and in life and death
situations, you help family.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.935
No one can judge you for that.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.418
I'm so sorry you felt like
you couldn't tell me.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.423
I am so sorry.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.259
Thank you.

38:27.261 --> 38:30.482
I really wanna help you
with your investigation
with Lex.

38:52.547 --> 38:59.162
So, Sebastian Melmoth
withdrew $5.8 billion
from L-Corp on October 10th.

38:59.206 --> 39:03.166
The same day
AmerTek paid $5.8 billion

39:03.210 --> 39:05.734
for a missile base in Rubniu.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.170
Coincidence?

39:07.214 --> 39:08.998
-No, I don't believe in them.
-Hmm.

39:09.042 --> 39:12.350
More likely, our mystery man
took the money he withdrew
from L-Corp

39:12.393 --> 39:16.354
and paid for the missile base
using AmerTek as a smokescreen.

39:17.616 --> 39:21.663
So, who is Sebastian Melmoth
and where the hell is Rubniu?

39:31.064 --> 39:34.415
That nostalgic bastard.

39:36.852 --> 39:40.378
When Lex was 13,
he read the entire works
of Oscar Wilde

39:40.421 --> 39:44.207
and for weeks,
he had us call him
by Oscar Wilde's pseudonym,

39:44.251 --> 39:46.471
Sebastian Melmoth.

39:46.514 --> 39:50.170
Are we saying that Lex Luthor
bought a missile base?

39:50.213 --> 39:51.693
No, but not in Rubniu.

39:51.737 --> 39:56.263
Lex loves codes,
so Sebastian loves codes.

39:58.483 --> 40:02.225
It's a double-breasted
interrupted key cipher.
It's Lex's favorite.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.417
Guess we're going to Kaznia.

40:32.604 --> 40:33.474
No.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.346
No. No.

40:38.697 --> 40:39.741
Lydia!

40:39.785 --> 40:42.831
No. No. No. Sweetheart...

40:44.311 --> 40:47.575
No. No.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.492
No!

41:42.108 --> 41:43.718
Father.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.200
You have done well, my son.

41:47.243 --> 41:48.201
Go home now.

41:48.244 --> 41:50.029
Join your family.
