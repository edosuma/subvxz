want it?

in here periodically,

10:11.111 --> 10:12.726

in a group setting.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.237

that we can talk to, then?

very well. Sorry.

even ifyou don't think
it's important.

enemies, uh, possibly
seeing each other?

there's anything else
that you can think of.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.745

I'm gonna take a look around,

11:21.932 --> 11:23.593
talk to a few
other people.
Sure.

11:26.812 --> 11:30.304

can be real losers,
bottom feeders.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.429
Not like programmers.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.267

the highest echelon.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.193

11:37.155 --> 11:38.816
Hmm, good call, Betty.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.487
Wow, it's like

Yeah, it responds
to your own cerebral
evoked potentials.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.332
You see, it feeds
an impulse beam
into your retinas,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.167
which then bounces off
the back of the amyg...

11:53.380 --> 11:55.462
Maybe we should just
get a demonstration.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.998
Yeah.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.796
Zack,uh,
run simulation 429.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.502
I still haven't
figured out that glitch.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.303
No,Wsﬁne
wrademo.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.341
Do it.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.976
Okay, now make sure
those visors are down,

12:13.901 --> 12:15.516
pull that trigger to fire,

12:16.904 --> 12:19.236
and playing will
teach you the rest.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.732
Mine actually feels
cold in my hands.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.508
Oh! Tangos! Game on.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.461
Kiera?

13:26.556 --> 13:27.716
Kiera?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.344
What's going on,
are you okay?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.049
I told you we shouldn't
have let them in here.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.884
This is not our fault.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.561
Are you all right, Agent?

13:38.402 --> 13:39.733
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.568
Ijust... Ijust... Air.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.151
Air. Ijust need air.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.404
Alec?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.504
Alec, can you hear me?
I've got nothing,

14:08.682 --> 14:11.674
all my systems
are down. Alec?

14:12.644 --> 14:13.929
Oh, God!

14:20.986 --> 14:22.851

14:25.782 --> 14:27.033

(PHONE RINGING)

14:41.214 --> 14:43.205
Alec, Itried
calling your cell.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.165
Kiera, what happened?
All my monitors are down.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.133
I can't get through
to you on your CMR.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.383
I know. Iwas
playing a virtual
reality simulation.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.214
What kind of simulation?
lmmersive.

14:52.309 --> 14:56.848
I had on a helmet, um...
There was a jolt of pain
in my head,

14:56.980 --> 14:58.811
and my vision blurred.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.934
Are you okay?

15:00.025 --> 15:01.060
Yeah, thanks.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.608
Um... Can you tell me
what happened?

15:03.695 --> 15:05.811
Uh... Something must've
shorted out your CMR,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.737
maybe there was
some interference with
the interactive circuits

15:07.824 --> 15:08.904
on the VR helmet.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.823
I may need to reboot you.

15:10.911 --> 15:11.991
How?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.695
I'm not sure, let me see
what I can do from this end.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.496
Thank you.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.995
(WHIRRING)

15:21.213 --> 15:23.329
Thanks. Okay,
I'll call you back.

15:24.549 --> 15:28.588
So, the ME said
both suicide killers had
amphetamines in their system.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.760
Okay, interesting.
How'd they get there?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.095
They were both gamers.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.175
I saw cans of Torsion
at Tendyne,

15:36.561 --> 15:40.099
it's popular with
the set who go online
and play games all night.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.101
There have been a lot
of media reports lately

15:42.192 --> 15:44.683
about 20 year olds
with severe heart issues,

15:44.903 --> 15:47.565
because it's worse
than crack and it's legal.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.402
So, consumed in
large enough quantities,
it can cause psychosis?

15:51.535 --> 15:54.151
If you believe the reports,
it can cause hallucinations,

15:54.246 --> 15:56.157
paranoia, delusions...

15:56.248 --> 15:58.455
So delusional they could
become psychotic?

15:58.542 --> 16:01.204
Amphetamines,
violent video games...

16:01.419 --> 16:03.205
It could be
a pretty potent mix.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.681
Okay, Kiera,
you wanted information
about the gang?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.724
You are about to get it.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.064
Ha! Good old Lucas.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.022
He always did have
a thing for pugilists.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.398
Here.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.282

16:56.683 --> 16:57.763
Oh, it's not like that.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.637
I come here all the time,
I didn't know you came here.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.758
I don't believe you.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.139
Seriously,
Ijust like this place.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.512
I guess I'm gonna have
to find another place.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.848
Kellog, come on, man.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.354
Now that you're here,
have a drink. My treat.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.102
What do you want?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.940
Jack and Coke.

17:15.202 --> 17:19.115
Excuse me?
Jack and Coke and
a scotch on the rocks.

(PHONE RINGING)

17:32.219 --> 17:33.880
(CLEARS THROAT)
So I got an update.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.671
I hacked into your CMR
and I found a system
restore mode.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.799
The good news is that
it gave me an idea about
how to activate your suit.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.054
What's the bad news?

17:42.145 --> 17:45.353
There's still a lot
of encrypted files and
firewalls up the yin yang.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.815
I should be able hack it
but I'm gonna need to meet you
and reboot you physically.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.188
Okay, uh, can we do it
at my apartment?

17:51.321 --> 17:53.232
Yeah, that'd be
a lot better than
you coming here

17:53.323 --> 17:55.530
and having to explain
to my mom and Roland
who you are.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.903
Actually,
that might be kinda fun.

17:59.162 --> 18:02.996
Oh, Alec,
just figure it out, please.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.498
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.541
You betcha.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.081
If I were me,
and wanted to
hide something,

18:13.176 --> 18:14.962
I'd have
a contingency route...

18:23.520 --> 18:25.852
Wow, that was
surprisingly easy.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.060
Okay, password.
Password, uh...

18:30.527 --> 18:32.358
I should know the password,
I designed the thing.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.482
Of course!

how much you drink.

are so serious.

get more exciting.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.393

working on something

a total game changer.

There's no connection
between either of them
or the victims.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.887
You got anything?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.893
Nothing aside from
intercompany emails

20:34.984 --> 20:37.976
that they were both CC'd on,
at least not in the last
four weeks, anyway.

20:41.116 --> 20:44.028

to have been destroyed

20:44.160 --> 20:45.195

from the shelves.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.412
Supposed to have been?

20:46.496 --> 20:49.659
Yeah, there's an underground
market for gamers who are
hooked on it.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.206
Stories of stockpiles
hoarded away,

20:52.335 --> 20:54.371

you could only purchase

20:54.504 --> 20:56.495
if you had
a contact...

20:56.631 --> 21:00.499
I called some friends
in the hacker world
who live on the stuff.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.092
Legend has it
the remaining inventory

21:03.179 --> 21:05.636
was secretly bought up
by someone.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.635
Gabrielle Cosgrove.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.802
Looks like we're
gonna have to talk
to Ms. Cosgrove again.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.813
Okay, Betty, I know
she's your hero, but...

21:16.317 --> 21:19.400
I know. I'll get
all the dirt on her
that I can.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.527

Thank you, Betty.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.271
Good work, Mr. Nettinger.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.277
Well I must admit,
I wasn't sure my program

21:25.368 --> 21:27.529
would yield such
powerful results.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.987
Butwhen both
Mark and Yvonne
responded so well...

21:30.081 --> 21:31.582
Yes, now the hard drive
ifyou”.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.040
And when she put
the helmet on,
Agent Cameron...

21:34.210 --> 21:36.462
The circuitry specs
you gave me
were magnificent.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.037
I was able to capture
the coordinates of her
internal chip...

21:39.924 --> 21:41.130
Hey!

21:41.217 --> 21:43.208
You've been
very instrumental
in helping us out,

21:43.344 --> 21:46.211
and now it's time
for your reward.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.591
Circuitry specs for
a liquid chip technology.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.561
Is this as good
as you say?

21:55.690 --> 22:00.559
Mr. Nettinger,
this is so beyond
what you've done.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.193
You can easily inject this
in someone's head,

22:03.281 --> 22:05.863
and combined with their code,
feed them instructions

22:05.950 --> 22:07.451
in real time.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.109
You become
the puppet master.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.287
Oh! (LAUGHING)

22:16.211 --> 22:18.247
No one else has
this information?
All yours.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.505
Gonna make you a fortune.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.251
What about
Special Agent Cameron,
won't she try to stop me?

22:22.425 --> 22:24.256
The information
that you've collected
on this hard drive

22:24.385 --> 22:26.592
holds the access code
to agent Cameron's chip.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.763
I can pull her strings now,
and let me assure you,

22:30.225 --> 22:32.762
she won't be around
much longer to stop anyone.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.773
You gave your employees
a banned substance with
harmful side effects.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.275
My client has done nothing
to break the law.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.353
So, you just scooped up
all the Torsion

22:44.447 --> 22:47.189
you could get your hands on
as a public service?

22:47.283 --> 22:50.195
My client found it
increased productivity
and reduced fatigue

22:50.286 --> 22:52.618
without compromising
the quality of work.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.450
Each employee
knew the risks,

22:54.582 --> 22:57.449
they partook of the
substance on their own
and signed a waiver

22:57.544 --> 22:58.784
which we can
produce in court.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.707
I'll be sure
to tell that to Greg Moritz
and Cole Bartley's families.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.255
Look, I may be guilty
of poorjudgment

23:05.468 --> 23:07.299
but that's all
I'm guilty of.

23:08.263 --> 23:09.378
Are we done yet?

23:09.472 --> 23:12.214
Unless you're
charging my client,
this interview's over.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.225
Go.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.979
So the coroner said
that there was
no abnormalities

23:20.108 --> 23:21.723
in the killers' brains
and that blood levels

23:21.818 --> 23:23.934
from modified ephedrine
were way below anything

23:24.070 --> 23:25.480
that could cause
psychotic behavior.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.733
So it wasn't the Torsion.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.234
Back to square one.

Yup.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.163

23:38.167 --> 23:40.499
I'm gonna go check
with my contacts
at Section 6,

23:40.587 --> 23:41.918
they might have
some answers.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.461
Want me to come along?

23:43.548 --> 23:44.913
Another time.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.839
Hey, you know
what else contributes
to team building?

23:46.968 --> 23:49.505
Telling your partner
what you're doing,
what you're thinking.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.675
Found the connection
between Gabrielle Cosgrove

23:53.766 --> 23:55.097
and both victims.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.934
Between the victims,
not the killers?
Yeah.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.307
Gabrielle knew
the first victim,
Greg Moritz.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.348
He was the CEO of
a rival gaming company.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.268
A few years ago
they were caught up
in a nasty lawsuit.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.273
Greg came out on top.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.611
Second victim, Cole Bartley,
used to work with Gabrielle

24:11.701 --> 24:13.942
at a dot-com start-up
in Silicon Valley.

24:14.037 --> 24:16.699
Seems Gabrielle was
fired for apparently
being difficult

24:16.831 --> 24:19.948
to work with
while Bartley went
on to get promoted

24:20.043 --> 24:22.204
several times and
make a small fortune.

24:22.712 --> 24:23.952
Nice work!

24:25.840 --> 24:28.206
Looks like I'm on
my way back to Tendyne.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.545
How long is this
gonna take?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.505
Ithake
as long as it takes.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.300
You're in a great mood.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.552
(WHISPERS)
That was sarcasm.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.020
Sorry, I'm just
a little distracted here.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.223
So you're working
on a case?

24:45.318 --> 24:48.401
Yeah, two beta testers
both decide to kill someone

24:48.488 --> 24:50.149
and then take
their own lives.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.445
What's your
working theory?

24:51.532 --> 24:52.817
Theory?

24:53.576 --> 24:56.067
I'm a little short
on theories these days.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.161
Although...

24:59.248 --> 25:00.988
What?
In the future,

25:01.668 --> 25:04.501
scientists will create
a program that produces

25:04.587 --> 25:07.579
a pattern of
light frequencies that
controls part of the brain.

25:08.591 --> 25:12.425
It makes the subject
suggestible, controllable.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.753
What, like hypnotism?

25:15.098 --> 25:16.679
Ithoughtyou
couldn't hypnotize
someone to do something

25:16.766 --> 25:18.757
they normally wouldn't do,
like commit suicide
or murder.

25:18.893 --> 25:20.133
Right, you can't.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.225
But this is
way beyond hypnotism,

25:22.313 --> 25:25.771
this is about
radically shifting
neuronal patterning.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.228
Hijacking the mind.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.735
Soundser
a brain/software interface.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.895
It's kinda like what
I'm trying to do here.

25:33.408 --> 25:36.491
Question is, could someone
in this time be doing that?

25:37.995 --> 25:39.610
Apparently I can.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.658
(PHONE RINGING)

25:42.458 --> 25:43.789
Cameron.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.951
Gabrielle Cosgrove
knew both victims,

25:46.087 --> 25:47.293
I'm going to Tendyne.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.663
I can meet you
in 45 minutes?

25:49.799 --> 25:52.131
VVeH,Iguess
I'll have to start
without you.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.969
Are we done?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.301
Yeah, as done
as we can be

25:59.434 --> 26:01.971
when we're operating
on the cutting edge
of pseudo-science.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.010
Sorry.

26:04.981 --> 26:05.970
Uh!

26:10.069 --> 26:11.980
My HUD isn't up.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.312
Yeah, it takes some time
for it to reboot.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.065
How much time?

26:17.160 --> 26:19.321
I don't know,
I've never done
this before but, uh,

26:19.412 --> 26:22.324
your mitotic circuitry
seems to cycle itself
once every hour

26:22.457 --> 26:23.822
so probably
no longer than that.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.999
Okay, so once
I'm back online,

26:28.171 --> 26:31.004
I need you to see
if you can find
any encrypted files

26:31.090 --> 26:33.422
in Tendyne's game code,
and lock the door
when you leave,

26:33.509 --> 26:35.625
and,oh,yeah,
no snooping, please.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.673
Wait, um,
I should tell you...

26:40.600 --> 26:41.760
What?

26:45.855 --> 26:48.187
Uh, nothing,
just be safe.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.794
Yeah?
Don't I know you?

27:16.219 --> 27:18.005
Me? Uh, no.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.843
No, I definitely know you.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.645
University kitchen,
gun to your head,

27:29.899 --> 27:30.979
happento
ring any bells?

27:31.067 --> 27:33.058
Right, yeah.
Uh, listen,
about that...

27:33.194 --> 27:34.309
Who are you?

27:34.403 --> 27:37.236
I'm, uh...
lwork with Kiera.

27:38.741 --> 27:39.856
You're Section 6?

27:39.951 --> 27:40.986
Section 6...

27:42.912 --> 27:44.698
She told you
about Section 6?

27:48.584 --> 27:51.246
No, no, she doesn't
tell me anything.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.920
Detective Carlos Fonnegra.

27:55.591 --> 27:59.709
I, uh, I'd tell you my name
but, you know, Section 6.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.219
Okay, I get it.

28:02.515 --> 28:03.595
What are you doing here?

28:03.724 --> 28:05.680
Kiera said
she needed to see me.

28:06.269 --> 28:07.850
She brought you in
on this case?

28:07.937 --> 28:10.178
Right, yeah.
Listen, is she inside?

28:10.898 --> 28:13.685
No, no, I'm meeting her
at Tendyne Systems.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.852
Of course,
Tendyne Systems.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.187
Hey, I'll see you there.

28:20.283 --> 28:21.443
ka .
O y Okay.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.401
Wow, uh...
Tendyne Systems.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.201
(PHONE RINGING)
Come on, Keira.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.622
Okay, I'm in.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.710
Can you control her?

28:39.802 --> 28:41.042
Not yet.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.549
Accessing her CMR code
must've shorted
her circuitry.

28:45.474 --> 28:49.638
Her system's rebooting,
but in less than an hour

28:49.770 --> 28:52.307
she'll be back online,
and then her mind is ours.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.896
You knew both victims,
Greg Moritz,

28:58.154 --> 28:59.314
Cole Bartley.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.312
My client has
nothing further to say.

29:01.616 --> 29:02.731
Of course I knew them.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.816
The software development
world is small.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.237
I know or have worked
with most of the players
in this field.

29:09.624 --> 29:12.457
Cole Bartley I hadn't
given a thought to in years,

29:12.585 --> 29:14.291
and as for Greg Moritz,

29:14.420 --> 29:16.911
I was in the process
of buying his company.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.331
We have documents
to back that up.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.258
Okay, and why didn't you
mention this to us the
first time we questioned you?

29:22.345 --> 29:24.256
The terms of the sale
were confidential.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.264
I had advised her
not to say anything about her
association with Greg Moritz

29:28.351 --> 29:30.467
until we knew
the fallout
from his death.

29:30.603 --> 29:34.266
So, now that he's dead
you can just pick over his
corpse at cut-rate prices.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.189
Now that he's dead
I'm sure the deal's off.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.435
We were finalizing
details of the sale,

29:40.529 --> 29:42.611
but now that he's dead,
everything's up in the air.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.189
Check with the CFO,
he'll confirm everything.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.150
Okay, I'll be
sure to do that.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.365
Still doesn't
prove anything.

29:52.375 --> 29:55.367
Tendyne had millions
to gain by this sale.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.709
Greg's death will
put an end to that.

29:58.881 --> 30:02.715
Believe me, losing this
deal is the last thing
I could've wanted.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.550
Okay,

30:04.887 --> 30:06.718
I'll check your story
and get back to you.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.383
Thanks for
your time, ladies.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.558
HeHo,Tendyne.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.597
For a high-tech enterprise,

30:18.693 --> 30:20.479
your security is
surprisingly lame.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.106
All right, let's take
a look at these codes.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.525
What? What are you?

30:32.748 --> 30:33.954
No way!

30:34.041 --> 30:36.157

with a brand new CP?

30:45.302 --> 30:47.884
All right,
let's try this baby out.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.189
Oh, you're back online.

31:43.027 --> 31:45.689
I was just looking
at Tendyne's game codes
and you won't believe...

31:45.780 --> 31:47.941
Alec, my head
really hurts again.

31:48.032 --> 31:50.239
Yeah, sorry, it should
settle down after the reboot.

31:50.326 --> 31:52.191
Hold on, stay with me.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.532

Hey, where are you?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.376
I thought you were
meeting me at Tendyne.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.756
Did you talk
to Cosgrove?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.929
Yeah, her and her lawyer.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.511
It's a dead end,
it looks like we need
to dig a little deeper.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.093
Okay, uh, /’/I meet you
back at the precinct.

32:20.231 --> 32:21.562
You still there?

32:22.316 --> 32:23.556
Is she talking to us?

32:24.068 --> 32:25.399
Yeah, I'm still here. Um...

32:25.486 --> 32:28.273
I was trying to tell you
that I was looking at the
beta testers' source codes

32:28.364 --> 32:30.104
for Tendyne's new game,

32:30.616 --> 32:32.447
there are some
pre-processor obfuscators,

32:32.535 --> 32:35.743
somebody's deliberately
concealing executables
within the application.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.030
Someone is hiding code
within the code.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.374
Who is she talking to?

32:42.837 --> 32:45.249
I don't know
but she's using
her bio-upgrade comps.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.289
Could another protector
have gotten through?

32:50.261 --> 32:52.047
Run a trace, find out.

32:52.847 --> 32:56.180
I was able to parse it
and then when I looked at it,
I completely blanked out.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.136
Next thing I know,
27 minutes went by.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.764
It's like you said,
my mind was
completely hijacked.

33:00.855 --> 33:04.097
So Gabrielle Cosgrove
did intend to kill
Bartley and Moritz?

33:04.441 --> 33:06.853
No, it's not Cosgrove.
My money is on whoever
wrote the code.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.525
Cosgrove is just
the businessperson.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.315
Let me guess
who wrote the code.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.609
Fred Nettinger.

We go back to Tendyne...

33:20.749 --> 33:22.785
I think it was Nettinger.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.663
They know
about Nettinger.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.502
He's become a liability.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.880
Did your contacts
at Section 6
tell you that?

33:29.967 --> 33:31.628
KIERA: I’ll explain
everything when / see you.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.050
Stop her.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.391
You said you had her
under your control.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.342
She's still spooling
through reboot.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.269
A few more minutes.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.934
I have a message
for Agent Cameron.

I'm sorry,
if you don't have any ID...

33:51.989 --> 33:53.525
Mr. Nettinger!
Excuse me...

33:53.991 --> 33:56.277
Yes.
Just the man
I wanted to see.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.360
Brad Anderson from
In Code magazine.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.407
We're thinking about doing
a feature article on you.

34:01.498 --> 34:04.456
I was wondering
if I could have
a few moments of your time.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.712
Okay, so what's the plan?

34:10.925 --> 34:13.462
They've figured out
how to brainwash people
that play their game.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.884
We need to find Nettinger
and the program files.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.050
And I'm in.

34:23.354 --> 34:25.060

KIERA: Yeah.

It's...
It's just a headache,

34:28.817 --> 34:30.682
Have her eliminate

38:39.985 --> 38:41.395
Are you okay?

38:41.487 --> 38:42.977
Are you done?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.359
Whatjust happened?

38:48.577 --> 38:49.908
Nice job.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.697
How do you
explain this?

38:51.788 --> 38:53.574
Whoever is accessing her
has advanced coding skills.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.998
It's like he was
anticipating my every
move before I did it.

38:57.211 --> 38:58.371
More advanced than you?

38:58.462 --> 39:00.748
Which is impossible,
especially in this time.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.914
There is one person...

39:04.051 --> 39:07.635
Well, yes, but he is just...
Just a kid.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.925
That is the only
logical explanation.

39:24.655 --> 39:27.271
So Nettinger confessed
to writing a code

39:27.366 --> 39:29.277
that creates
a visual wave pattern.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.275
It, uh, brainwashes a person

39:32.371 --> 39:35.659
so that they kill somebody
and then commit suicide.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.212
Must've been what
happened to you, right?

39:45.926 --> 39:46.961
Yeah.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.679
Okay.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.469
Well, my question is

39:52.224 --> 39:54.089
when were you exposed
to the pattern?

39:55.102 --> 39:57.889
Was it, uh,
when you were playing
that game with Betty?

39:58.814 --> 40:00.179
It must've been.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.603
Okay, I'm gonna have
Betty checked out also,

40:03.694 --> 40:05.059
just as a precaution.

40:05.946 --> 40:08.813
What about Cole Bartley,
Greg Moritz?

40:09.616 --> 40:11.481
Well, Nettinger believed
that killing them

40:11.577 --> 40:14.193
would throw the suspicion
for the murders on Cosgrove.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.990
Two birds with one stone.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.204
Gets to test out his software
and take out the woman

40:21.295 --> 40:23.752
standing in the way
of his advancement.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.754
Clever.

40:27.301 --> 40:31.840
Yeah, your, uh, friend
had the same assessment.

40:33.515 --> 40:34.630
My friend?

40:34.725 --> 40:36.932
Yeah, your buddy
from Section 6.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.270
He was there
at Tendyne.

40:42.024 --> 40:43.230
Right.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.983
And if it wasn't for him,
you would've put
a bullet in me.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.451
About that...

40:55.996 --> 40:58.829
Carlos, I don't
remember anything.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.372
Kiera, listen,
forget about it.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.660
Despite what you want
people to believe,

41:04.755 --> 41:06.416
I know you're only human.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.377
Besides, I know
you were brainwashed
like Mark and Yvonne.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.514
That reminds me, uh,

41:18.602 --> 41:20.718
Dillon wants you
to get checked out
by a specialist.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.933
I knowjust the person.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.140
Okay, good.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.402
And when you do
see your buddy...

41:32.407 --> 41:34.568
Tell him that
I owe him my life, huh?

41:35.744 --> 41:37.905
You might wanna
say thanks also.

41:40.082 --> 41:41.743
Go home,
get some sleep.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.580
(PHONE RINGING)

41:52.761 --> 41:55.298
Alec.
Hey, you all right?

41:56.807 --> 41:57.887
Yeah.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.265
I think I need
another reboot.

42:02.270 --> 42:03.806
Yeah, and then I'm gonna
beef up your firewall

42:03.939 --> 42:05.224
so nobody can
hack you again.

42:06.817 --> 42:08.148
Can we do it tomorrow?

42:08.610 --> 42:10.271
Yeah, sure,
you must be tired.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.106
That's an understatement.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.024
Hey, Kiera...

42:17.119 --> 42:18.279
Yeah?

42:19.121 --> 42:21.954
When I was going
through your diagnostics,
I found a hidden file.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.203
Did you open it?

42:25.961 --> 42:27.542
It was full of
old memory traces,

42:27.629 --> 42:30.462
stuff that you thought
you've deleted
but is still there.

42:32.718 --> 42:34.834
I'd be curious to
see what you find.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.628
Or it could just be
broken code.

42:38.348 --> 42:39.849
Yeah, I know.

42:41.643 --> 42:43.383
Fill me in tomorrow, okay?

42:43.520 --> 42:44.885
Yeah, sure.

42:46.982 --> 42:48.643
Good night, Alec.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.065
Good night.

42:51.153 --> 42:54.691
