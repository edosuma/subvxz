00:01.419 --> 00:03.671
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.213 --> 00:06.882
- Daisy.
- She's not gonna get away with this.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.218
That wasn't Daisy.
That was a Life Model Decoy.

00:09.427 --> 00:11.887
The good news is Talbot is alive.
He's in a coma.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.223
I'm not saying we're definitely
gonna get locked up, but if we are,

00:14.348 --> 00:15.975
wouldn't mind grabbing a bite
to eat first.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.311
Take them.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.733
- We left one sitting at the counter, sir.
- Not on the list.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.819
<i>We came through a gateway,
some sort of temporal shift.</i>

00:26.986 --> 00:28.070
Fitz didn't get taken.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.613
<i>He's no doubt working this problem,</i>

00:29.780 --> 00:31.949
<i>probably trying to get a message
to us right now.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:55.139
You're not eating.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.641
Yeah, no. Not really hungry.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.061
You know, I think this is the first time

01:00.227 --> 01:02.438
we've all been together
in a really long time.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.524
Anybody have room for some pie?

01:05.691 --> 01:10.488
Okay, so we have apple, strawberry,
rhubarb, and chocolate banana cream.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.203
Here we go.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.417
- Phillip J. Coulson.
- Yep, that's me.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.503
You got us. Nice work.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.838
And congrats
on the whole power-outage thing.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.882
- That was very ominous.
- This is my fault.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.594
I'm gonna take full responsibility.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.772
Jemma?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.901
Hands in the air! Don't move!

01:51.779 --> 01:52.947
Where are the other six?

01:53.531 --> 01:55.991
Where are they? Where'd they go?

01:56.534 --> 01:57.618
I don't... know.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.496
- Take him.
- Wait. No.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.457
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, let go.
Wait! Just wait!

02:03.874 --> 02:06.961
I didn't do anything!
Something happened here! It wasn't me!

02:07.211 --> 02:08.795
I need to find them!

02:14.343 --> 02:16.303
Footage from
the damaged security camera confirms

02:16.470 --> 02:19.306
you all walked in together at 8:54 p.m.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.892
But at 9:47, when we arrived,

02:22.143 --> 02:23.435
you were the only one there.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.565
How'd they get out?
Where'd they go?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.194
I don't know.

02:35.948 --> 02:40.161
Okay. So, you're saying
it wasn't on the security camera?

02:40.411 --> 02:43.664
They conveniently blacked out
just over two minutes before we arrived.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.041
What happened during those two minutes?

02:46.375 --> 02:49.628
I swear I'm telling you the truth.
I don't know.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.589
Do you like Bendeery English Ale?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.883
- What?
- Security cameras captured

02:54.008 --> 02:57.595
a Bendeery truck parked just in front
of the diner before we arrived.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.098
Then it just... disappeared...

03:02.391 --> 03:03.934
like your friends.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.354
We've...
we've read your dossier, Fitz.

03:07.563 --> 03:10.441
- It's impressive.
- The Big Bad Brain of S.H.I.E.L.D.

03:10.608 --> 03:11.650
Did you help them escape

03:11.817 --> 03:13.485
with some kind of new S.H.I.E.L.D.
technology?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.779
- How did you know we were coming?
- I didn't!

03:17.281 --> 03:20.576
There was no crystal ball or...
or "Beam me up, Scotty."

03:20.701 --> 03:24.079
I don't know how they got away.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.626
I have a theory.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.253
You did it.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.465
You drugged our food or, uh,
used some kind of gas,

03:34.632 --> 03:37.092
and now you have them in rooms
just like this one,

03:37.468 --> 03:39.553
and you're messing with their mind
like you're messing with mine.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.723
So why don't you tell me...

03:43.599 --> 03:46.018
where the hell are they?

03:47.519 --> 03:48.812
Oh, come on.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.651
Who the hell is in charge here?

03:56.987 --> 03:59.531
Well, it's not General Talbot,

03:59.949 --> 04:01.992
since Agent Johnson put a bullet
in his head.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.161
That wasn't her. That was...
that was an LMD.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.996
Oh, right.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.167
Alibis by Asimov, huh?
Blame it on the robot.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.877
No, that's true.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.296
If it is, it was built and programmed
by S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.757
It was built by an android called Aida...

04:18.801 --> 04:20.135
and it answered to her...

04:21.095 --> 04:22.179
it.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.348
Is that the one that killed
Dr Holden Radcliffe?

04:24.515 --> 04:27.268
- Yes.
- And Jeffrey Mace?

04:29.311 --> 04:31.021
No, I'm responsible for that death.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.066
Okay?

04:34.692 --> 04:36.527
I'm telling you the truth,
I'm responsible.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.447
Is that why they left you behind?
For you to take the blame, huh?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.199
No, they wouldn't leave me.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.076
They wouldn't...

04:47.121 --> 04:48.247
I'm done.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.458
You're done when I say you're done.

04:51.667 --> 04:56.505
And if you don't cooperate,
you're gonna be here for a very long time.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.048
Do you understand?

05:20.696 --> 05:22.906
Time to get up.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.867
On your feet! Get up.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.662
Where is Phil Coulson?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.414
I don't know.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.583
Where is Daisy Johnson?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.168
I don't know.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.337
Where is Jemma Simmons?

05:39.548 --> 05:40.674
I wish I knew.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.303
I wish I knew, 'cause as much
as you want to find them

05:44.428 --> 05:45.512
and bring them to justice,

05:45.637 --> 05:47.514
I want to find them so I know
that they're okay.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.101
I am more than happy to pay for my sins,

05:51.268 --> 05:54.605
but I honestly do not know
where they are...

05:55.647 --> 05:57.066
or what happened to them.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.405
I swear I will do anything I can
to help you find them.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.494
If you let me.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.959
- He's telling the truth.
- Or he beat the machine.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.587
I don't think so.
I want him to fry as much as anyone,

06:18.837 --> 06:20.589
but he's the smartest guy
we've ever had in here.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.800
Maybe we should let his brain work for us,

06:23.384 --> 06:25.844
- help us solve this thing.
- What does he need?

06:26.095 --> 06:28.639
- Papers, pens, books.
- And a TV.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.516
To watch soccer.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.313
Make sure that's all he watches.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.470
What are you doing?

07:15.144 --> 07:17.271
<i>So, what do you have
for us this morning?</i>

07:18.188 --> 07:20.190
I told you about my experience
in the Framework.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.234
Yes. It seems very traumatic.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.237
And I did suffer previous brain trauma,
which may have been exacerbated.

07:26.405 --> 07:29.783
I may have suffered
from Prodromal Schizophrenia.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.869
So, it's possible I did something
to them...

07:32.703 --> 07:34.997
or, uh, I helped them escape, or...

07:35.706 --> 07:37.291
something worse...

07:38.041 --> 07:39.918
and blocked the memory.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.712
We interviewed everyone there,
Fitz.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.047
They all had the same two-minute lapse
in memory.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.757
It wasn't you.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.177
Okay.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.222
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.392
Are you okay?

07:56.935 --> 07:57.936
Yeah.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.856
There was something else, actually.
There was, um...

08:02.065 --> 08:05.486
a high-pitched, uh...

08:06.737 --> 08:08.322
Books.
I'm gonna need more books.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.699
Books on, uh, sonic frequencies,
sound waves...

08:10.866 --> 08:12.743
Get us a list. We'll get them.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.786
And there's something else.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.041
Would you be able to post this?

08:20.751 --> 08:22.419
Worst keeper I've ever seen in my life.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.005
It's a letter
to a soccer fanzine.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.424
The least offensive part
is when he calls the goalkeeper

08:27.549 --> 08:29.218
a Cro-Magnon Twit.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.597
Redact his name.
Have it analysed by our code-breakers.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.806
It'll keep him happy.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.934
His intel on Radcliffe's base panned out,
so, he's helping us...

08:39.019 --> 08:41.020
and he's our only chance
at finding the others.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.267
What are you doing? What are you doing?

09:18.976 --> 09:22.229
That's a free kick!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.328
<i>In six months,
you haven't brought us</i>

10:19.536 --> 10:21.121
a single plausible theory.

10:21.955 --> 10:27.002
I know. I know.
And I've been racking my brains...

10:28.170 --> 10:29.254
but...

10:31.214 --> 10:33.592
- I think...
- No more thinking.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.511
You're out of time. We want an answer.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.222
Okay.
I have one. I know what happened.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.725
By all means. Enlighten us.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.561
They were abducted by aliens.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.689
All right, that's it.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.566
We're done with you.

10:50.484 --> 10:54.988
No more books, no more television.
You've wasted our time.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.201
You're gonna grow old
and die alone in that cell.

11:01.912 --> 11:02.954
What?

11:04.247 --> 11:05.290
Here? How?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.210
<i>Hey, you can't go in there
without authorisation.</i>

11:08.377 --> 11:09.544
Your attorney is here.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.008
Get those cuffs off my client
and get the hell out of here.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.683
They printed my letters
in the last six issues

11:22.849 --> 11:25.519
- of <i>Ballbuster Hooligans.</i>
- And how many copies do you think

11:25.727 --> 11:28.105
are available in Bangladesh? None.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.815
As in zero.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.734
Soon as I heard you were missing,
I got hold of some.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.320
Where do you get off on calling Liverpool
a bunch of wankers?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.030
Well, if you never win anything,
then how do...

11:37.155 --> 11:39.157
Well, at least we're not trying
to buy our way back to glory.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.576
Hey. Do not talk crap about Man U.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.620
Me talking crap?
Your letters were nothing but crap.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.997
All that stuff about the...
How many European Cups have you won?

11:46.164 --> 11:48.208
Well, got your attention, didn't it?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.461
Finally. After six months!

11:51.670 --> 11:54.214
Well, maybe I should've
just thrown them out and left you here.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.009
- I missed you.
- You, too, mate.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.013
- It's good to see you.
- Mm-hm.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.435
Okay. There... there'll be times
for more hugs later.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.811
Okay. Okay.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.690
Hey, uh...

12:12.899 --> 12:15.986
- where are we?
- You're in a secure military installation.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.321
One of those "doesn't exist" places.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.991
But the law's the law,
so, they had to let me in.

12:21.658 --> 12:22.951
Okay.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.913
Well, at least you gave me enough time
to come up with a good escape plan.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.832
So, it's a mechanism

12:28.999 --> 12:32.252
that, um, I can slowly assemble,
but I'm gonna need you

12:32.419 --> 12:34.546
to smuggle it in piece by piece, um...

12:35.213 --> 12:37.883
so, if... if you could visit
three times a week for a month,

12:38.216 --> 12:39.801
then, uh, then I should have
everything I need.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.511
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna need you to move

12:41.636 --> 12:42.929
two meters to your left.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.893
Mm-hmm. And come forward.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.021
There we go.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.362
What the bloody hell?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.364
Your coded message didn't have
an escape plan,

13:01.490 --> 13:03.408
so I had to come up with one of my own.
Come on. Let's go.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.039
There's our way out!

13:11.833 --> 13:13.585
- Who's flying it?
- Rusty.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.462
The best getaway pilot money can buy.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.765
Well... the best getaway pilot
my money could buy.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.434
Please tell me your escape plan involves
an actual escape.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.228
He was supposed to draw their attention,

13:31.394 --> 13:32.813
lead them on a wild goose chase
up in the air,

13:32.938 --> 13:34.231
while we were getting away on the ground.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.024
Well, he's definitely got their attention.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.192
Come on.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.073
Wait.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.158
That piece of junk is our ride?

13:45.283 --> 13:47.911
Yeah, it's Rusty's, God bless his cold,
black soul.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.246
And...

13:49.579 --> 13:51.915
...it's the last thing
they'll be looking for.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.628
The last thing they'll be thinking
is that two ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

13:56.753 --> 13:58.296
would be stupid enough to try and escape
in this whale.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.173
Apparently, we are.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.592
There you go.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.762
Your phone.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.265
You're welcome.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
Now, Rusty kitted this thing out
with all sorts of bells and whistles.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.143
Is one of those bells and engine?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.311
There we go.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.731
See? It's even got cloaking.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.281
How the hell did he contact an attorney

14:24.447 --> 14:26.199
without any outside communication?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.703
- He mailed some letters.
- We mailed them.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.997
Rants to a magazine.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.457
I had them analysed and cleared.
There was nothing there.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.918
Well, obviously, there was.
Analyse them again.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.338
If you crack the code,
you find out who he's talking to.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.258
We checked all the surveillance footage
within a two-mile radius.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.635
Everything checks out except this.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.805
Are they the idiots, or are we?

14:49.347 --> 14:50.599
They won't get far in that thing.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.476
Well, if you find them, don't engage.
They could lead us to the others.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.155
Just his head set on fire?
Nothing else?

15:05.822 --> 15:06.907
Um... No.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.825
That's the strangest thing
I've ever heard.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.996
Except for the sexy robot that you made
that became human

15:13.246 --> 15:15.248
and wanted you to stick the old floppy
into her love drive.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.125
Can we not talk about this, please?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.170
Copy that. Message received.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.132
Well, my life has been perfectly boring
by comparison.

15:24.799 --> 15:25.967
Mercenary work,

15:26.134 --> 15:28.803
working with unscrupulous dirt-bags
like Rusty.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.848
- How are things with Bobbi?
- Good. Yeah.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.059
We're 100 percent compatible...

15:35.310 --> 15:36.561
fifty percent of the time.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.647
Nearly got married again.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.565
Until the ninjas showed up.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.527
So, you are together?

15:44.736 --> 15:46.696
Together forever, just...

15:47.364 --> 15:48.448
doing our own thing.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.825
Distance is our saviour.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.244
How about you and Simmons?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.163
Did you find a way to work that out?

15:55.580 --> 15:56.957
Distance is our curse.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.043
So, how are we gonna find her?

16:01.419 --> 16:04.089
Okay. Um...
The only real clue we have

16:04.214 --> 16:06.132
is a Bendeery English Ale truck.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.052
Chasing a beer truck. I like this plan.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.929
Do we get to plunder it when we find it?

16:11.096 --> 16:13.181
No, it vanished. I need a way to find it.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.558
Then you, my friend, are in the right RV.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.603
Among Rusty's more useful traits,

16:18.895 --> 16:20.981
piloting being henceforth removed
from that list...

16:21.856 --> 16:24.901
is that he was paranoid as balls.
A die-hard conspiracy theorist

16:25.402 --> 16:29.155
who liked to spy on anyone he thought was
spying on him, which was everyone.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.615
So...

16:31.491 --> 16:32.492
he can tap into surveillance.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.577
- Yep.
- Where is it?

16:35.036 --> 16:36.454
At the back,
beyond the margarita machine

16:36.579 --> 16:37.747
and the ferret cages.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.353
Oh, that's plenty of bells and whistles.
Thank you, Rusty.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.277
There it is.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.530
So, the truck arrived at the diner
just before they vanished.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.656
Look. That's them.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.452
There's... ten of them.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.244
Who's that?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.587
All the surveillance cameras
within a two-mile radius

17:25.712 --> 17:27.380
went dark for those two minutes.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.257
How is that possible?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.887
Where are you going?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.432
There it is.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.267
No, that's a postal truck.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.522
There?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.399
No.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.526
Why can you never find a beer truck
when you need one?

17:52.655 --> 17:53.656
Unless...

18:04.250 --> 18:05.668
Ruddy bloody hell.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.213
Got you now.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.937
I've been expecting you.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.439
What? Wait.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.275
No. We're here to surprise you,
so, act surprised.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.152
There's no need for violence.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.946
You were at the diner.

18:34.030 --> 18:38.284
I saw you. You put them in your truck,
and you brought them here.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.373
- Where are they?
- Two zero nine one.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.377
Earth Year. Two zero nine one.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.186
Why do I get the feeling
there's a kill room in the basement?

19:11.609 --> 19:14.028
Where is this? What's happening?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.073
No.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.624
- Who the hell are you?
- I was sent here 30,000 years ago

19:27.125 --> 19:29.919
to observe and record the evolution
of your species.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.255
What you would call an anthropologist.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.800
My Earth name is Enoch.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.847
I am a sentient Chronicom
from a planet which revolves around a star

19:40.972 --> 19:42.932
in the constellation you know as Cygnus.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.226
Yeah. We'll just go with "Enoch."

19:45.935 --> 19:48.730
Why?
Why did you send them through that thing?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.607
To fulfil a prophesy.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.110
This speaks of the future.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.821
They were needed there.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.282
Look, there's only so much crazy talk
I can take

19:59.449 --> 20:01.034
before I start shooting holes in it.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.328
Why didn't you take me?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.624
You weren't part of the Seer's prophecy,
Mr Fitz.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.961
You don't seriously believe all this,
do you?

20:12.420 --> 20:15.465
A prophecy and a Monolith
that sends you through time?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.050
Send me through to them.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.969
The Stone can only be activated
from the other end.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.264
I only knew when it would open.
I have no knowledge of who opened it.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.474
Somebody does.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.809
The, uh... the Seer?

20:28.144 --> 20:31.648
- Let's start there. Take me.
- I don't think it's wise.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.566
You don't think...

20:38.947 --> 20:42.867
You are going to take me
to whoever or whatever this Seer is,

20:43.451 --> 20:45.995
or your future ends now.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.466
I am trying to help, Mr Fitz.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.177
You did not need to threaten me.

21:01.928 --> 21:02.971
Sorry.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.182
I'm just worried about my friends.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.851
So, who is it?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.482
There.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.197
Search every room. They were here.
I want to know why.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.366
<i>- Clear.</i>
- What the hell?

21:23.700 --> 21:26.369
Stay on the RV,
but keep your distance and do not engage.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.912
We want to know where they're going.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.706
What do you make of all this?

21:30.290 --> 21:31.374
I have no idea.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.544
Hi, Enoch.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.379
Hello, Polly.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.937
I know you. You're Polly Hinton.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.397
Do I know you?

21:54.939 --> 21:57.191
I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D. Can I...

22:15.835 --> 22:17.045
You must be Robin.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.089
I'm Fitz.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.717
I'm friends with Daisy.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.528
What are we dealing with here?

22:45.490 --> 22:48.284
- Is there a kid's room in this house?
- No.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.078
Single male, lives alone.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.719
That magic crystal ball
we were theorising about,

23:07.345 --> 23:09.722
it's real, but it's not S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.725
It's a child.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.568
So, she's the Seer?

23:25.947 --> 23:27.907
You are a very good artist.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.284
Can I have a look?

23:38.209 --> 23:39.544
This is prophecy?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.587
She's been very active lately.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.220
What is that?
What are these... what are these symbols?

23:49.679 --> 23:52.515
An ancient language
from another galaxy.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
Never known to anyone on Earth.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.394
Until her.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.312
The quiet type, eh?

23:59.564 --> 24:00.773
Wish you could teach Bobbi that.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.734
Get a drink in her,
and she's like a wind-up doll.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.361
- You can't...
- They're here for us.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.787
- Let's go. Come on.
- Put these in.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.880
You're coming with us.
The girl, too.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.549
So, don't even think about
trying to run away.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.640
We just lost a half an hour of time.

24:47.778 --> 24:48.905
I think we lost them.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.407
Not for long.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.743
We need to find a place to lay low
for a while.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.039
I'm taking you to the place
where I sent the others.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.041
You said that was impossible.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.922
I'm taking you where, not when.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.431
<i>Under a lighthouse, eh?</i>

25:16.807 --> 25:18.142
How far down does this go?

25:18.768 --> 25:19.810
Unknown.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.272
- What is it?
- Unknown.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.900
Who built it?

25:27.777 --> 25:28.778
Unknown.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.282
<i>They just disappeared.</i>

25:33.783 --> 25:36.786
It had to be the same blackout technology
they used at the diner.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.038
Do we have any idea who the girl is?

25:39.247 --> 25:41.999
We've got images from surveillance cameras
across the street.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.294
We're running facial-recognition scans
on her and her mother.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.964
Well, make it your highest priority.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.676
If she's able to predict and forewarn,

25:52.218 --> 25:53.970
she might be able to tell secrets.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.309
I want you to find her and control her.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.645
It's better she's on our side.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.064
We need every weapon in this fight.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.650
As of this moment,
you are the only four humans

26:08.067 --> 26:09.527
who know of this place's existence.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.321
How do you know about it?

26:17.118 --> 26:19.161
We'll stay until we can decide what to do
with her.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.496
She is no longer safe.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.332
Why don't you just ask her?
She seems to know everything else.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.959
She gives answers in her own time.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.044
It's better not to interfere.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.715
Hey.
You sent my friends into the future.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.675
I'd call that some serious interference.

26:32.842 --> 26:35.011
Our protocol allows for one exception...

26:35.761 --> 26:38.264
the prevention
of an extinction-level event.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.349
What?

26:41.934 --> 26:42.935
So, what happened?

26:43.811 --> 26:45.229
Unknown.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.715
Sad, isn't it?

27:13.716 --> 27:16.510
To know all she knows
and not be able to do a thing about it.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.264
Maybe she's trying.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.892
No. You can't save the world.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.019
I can barely save myself.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.149
What's her story?
How do you know her?

27:30.483 --> 27:32.234
Her father was an Inhuman.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.362
Every time he touched someone...

27:35.404 --> 27:38.491
he and that person would have a vision
of an impending death.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.577
And it must have been torturous.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.623
So, he couldn't have any human contact.
Not with his wife. Not with his...

27:47.124 --> 27:48.793
not his baby daughter.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.128
And they still call these "gifts"?

27:52.088 --> 27:53.255
He saved Daisy.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.968
And... she was convinced
that she could save him,

27:58.094 --> 27:59.428
change the future, but...

28:00.680 --> 28:01.931
What's written is written.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.016
Jemma and I were there.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.893
Holding hands.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.396
We had no idea.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.525
So...

28:13.734 --> 28:14.819
you and Simmons?

28:15.861 --> 28:16.904
Yeah.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.781
Yeah, we're together now.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.242
Everyone knows.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.371
- Even looked for a place together.
- Oh, congrats, mate.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.666
I remember when you couldn't even admit
that you liked her.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.001
Maybe it should have stayed that way.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.254
Everything that keeps happening to us

28:33.504 --> 28:35.798
does seem like the universe
doesn't want us to be together.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.134
The universe doesn't want
or care about anything.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.386
And even if it did,
why wouldn't it want you to be together?

28:40.970 --> 28:44.056
You two are so perfect for each other,
it makes everyone a little bit nauseous.

28:44.974 --> 28:46.308
Maybe it's trying to protect her.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.812
- From what?
- From me.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.231
From what I was in the Framework...

28:55.609 --> 28:57.278
'cause that came from inside me.
That's...

28:59.321 --> 29:00.614
wasn't programming.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.702
Was that the Fitz I saw
back at Enoch's place?

29:06.454 --> 29:07.455
Yeah.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.875
I have to admit,
I kind of liked seeing that side of you.

29:11.709 --> 29:12.793
And it worked for us.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.004
Got Enoch on the right page.

29:15.129 --> 29:16.964
Yeah, well, it also got people killed.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.384
Look, I don't know what you went through,

29:20.551 --> 29:22.428
but I know
you're not a cold-blooded killer.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.973
Every light needs a shadow.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.851
You just have to learn how to control it,
use it when you need it.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.520
I can't stand it being anywhere inside
of me.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.565
I think that's why they left me behind,
I think...

29:34.732 --> 29:36.817
'cause I'm too much of a risk to them,
too...

29:38.527 --> 29:39.904
too much of a risk to Jemma.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.906
Bollocks. You want to know
why you were left behind?

29:42.031 --> 29:43.991
Ask the one that kicked you off
the guest list.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.332
- Get it while it's hot.
- Thanks.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.460
It smells good.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.505
I'm sorry about your friends.

30:01.258 --> 30:04.220
Did Robin ever say
why I wasn't supposed to go with them?

30:04.970 --> 30:06.889
She doesn't say much at all.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.558
Not since Terrigenesis.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.312
I found her in a state
just like her father.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.105
She was way too young to go through that.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.025
Her mind has been scattered.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.947
Past, present, future,
it's all the same to her, all mixed up.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.616
Sometimes, she doesn't even know
I'm her mother.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.578
I'm sorry.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.917
Enoch has been very helpful.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.379
He's helped me to understand and...

30:39.338 --> 30:40.464
accept.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.132
And she lives...

30:43.008 --> 30:44.969
mostly inside her head now...

30:46.220 --> 30:47.304
but...

30:47.972 --> 30:49.014
we can try.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.939
Robin, sweetie.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.610
Mr Fitz has brought you some breakfast.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.737
And he has a question for you.

31:05.239 --> 31:09.034
He'd like to know
why he's not with his friends.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.120
Can you tell Fitz?

31:11.912 --> 31:13.998
He'd really like to know
why he's not with them.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.464
'Cause you have to save them.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.142
They're in trouble some 70 years
in the future,

31:33.309 --> 31:34.727
and there's nothing I can do?

31:36.604 --> 31:39.732
I'll be a skeleton
by the time they get here.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.526
- I may know another way.
- Oh, now there's a way?

31:42.776 --> 31:44.028
What happened to no interference?

31:44.987 --> 31:46.238
It's prophecy now.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.449
Right.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.577
How, Enoch?

31:52.453 --> 31:53.829
How do I get to them?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.749
I came to Earth in a small capsule.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.126
It was discovered decades ago,

31:59.376 --> 32:03.589
and is now secured in a warehouse.
It might be able to take you to them.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.342
Okay. Where is it?

32:07.009 --> 32:09.345
Have you heard of a place
called Blue Raven Ridge?

32:11.305 --> 32:12.348
You're joking.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.184
- You know it?
- Yeah, of course I know it.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.518
We just broke out of it.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.646
It's the military base
they were holding you in.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.358
Okay, well...

32:23.359 --> 32:26.278
hate to say it,
but we're gonna have to break back in.

32:32.910 --> 32:35.287
<i>We're breaking
a basic rule of espionage.</i>

32:35.537 --> 32:38.332
Never walk into the same place
as two different people.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.002
We don't have a choice.
You sure these IDs are gonna hold up?

32:42.169 --> 32:43.170
I hope so.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.756
- Cooter didn't have much time.
- Cooter?

32:45.923 --> 32:48.467
- An old friend of Rusty's. He's very...
- Let me guess,

32:48.676 --> 32:49.885
he's the best your money could afford.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.894
Afternoon.
We're here to fix a hole in the wall.

33:00.396 --> 33:01.522
IDs.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.905
Rusty Peltzer and Jimmy Futterman.

33:10.698 --> 33:14.576
That's us. You break it, we fix it
and charge you the military mark-up.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.375
Too much?

33:23.919 --> 33:26.296
If Cooter hasn't got us in the system,
then this is all over.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.591
No. Then we'll find another way.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.510
What? From our tiny little cells?

33:44.732 --> 33:46.525
All clear. You know where you're going?

33:46.734 --> 33:48.318
Know it like the back of our hands.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.918
Rusty always said
there was alien artefacts on this base.

34:05.919 --> 34:09.047
Maybe...
he wasn't so crazy after all.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.681
These are extremely volatile
and unpredictable.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.434
Screw up once, you could lose a limb.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.938
Once we do this...

34:26.273 --> 34:27.315
that's it.

34:28.150 --> 34:29.275
No turning back.

34:30.319 --> 34:31.320
Let's do it.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.868
Okay.

34:39.328 --> 34:40.496
Release the ferrets.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.670
What's that mean?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.215
Something's setting off
the perimeter alarms.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.263
- You seeing this?
<i>- We got a 10-98 here.</i>

34:58.597 --> 35:00.307
<i>Repeat, a 10-98.</i>

35:02.684 --> 35:04.728
They'll instinctively head
for the drains and vents.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.273
Motion sensors will interpret
that as an escape, right?

35:08.899 --> 35:10.692
And procedure will seal the perimeter,

35:11.485 --> 35:12.694
leaving us alone in here.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.864
Which is fine,
till we need to get out.

35:25.791 --> 35:26.959
This is it.

35:36.218 --> 35:37.761
You sure this is it?

35:42.266 --> 35:43.934
This is gonna get me there...

35:44.977 --> 35:46.353
...if I'm lucky.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.230
All right.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.107
Let's get this back on the truck.

35:51.275 --> 35:52.484
We're not gonna need a truck.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.796
Brings back memories.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.257
We had some good times back in the day.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.593
In between all the bad times
and getting shot at,

36:17.801 --> 36:20.262
and chased and attacked
by monsters.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.265
Yeah. This place...

36:25.517 --> 36:27.895
the base... always felt like home.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.856
- Like family.
- Ah, don't worry.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.274
You'll be together again soon.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.526
You're just saying that.

36:35.068 --> 36:36.111
Yeah, of course I am.

36:36.278 --> 36:39.239
They're stuck 70-odd years in the future,
and our world's about to end.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.867
The odds, my friend,
are not in your favour.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.368
Are they ever?

36:46.079 --> 36:47.539
Well, let's see what we've got here.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.792
Fitzy.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.544
We just hit the jackpot.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.963
They've brought everything
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.173
What the hell's going on here?

37:10.312 --> 37:13.315
Go upstairs, fire up the guidance system,
and activate auto-take-off.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.192
I'll hold them off here
and close the doors!

37:15.317 --> 37:16.318
Uh. Shouldn't you do the technical,

37:16.485 --> 37:17.945
and I'll...

37:18.070 --> 37:19.154
- Go!
- All right.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.429
I know you mean well.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.140
I'm sorry that it has to end this way,

37:47.683 --> 37:49.726
but you have continually let me down.

37:51.645 --> 37:53.105
I don't trust you anymore.

37:53.981 --> 37:55.857
- You're demoting us?
- No.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.081
I need a cleaning crew.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.142
These will be waiting for me
when I get there.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.734
Team S.H.I.E.L.D. will be fully armed.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.200
How does this get Fitz to the future?

38:48.744 --> 38:50.162
It's a Cryo-Freeze Chamber.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.706
What?

38:53.749 --> 38:55.625
Yeah.
I'm taking the long way there.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.755
Gonna sleep for 74 years.

39:00.505 --> 39:04.092
That is the most insane idea
in our history of insane ideas.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.927
- Yep.
- We can't hide you in a wall.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.220
You'll suffocate when you wake up.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.764
And if we leave you sitting around here,

39:08.930 --> 39:10.807
who knows what people or things are gonna
find their way in there.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.517
He's not going to be here.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.020
I summoned a Chronicom Vessel.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.647
We'll orbit a planet hidden safely away
from Earth

39:17.856 --> 39:20.275
- until he wakes up.
- Oh, great. That's brilliant.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.277
Are you ready?

39:33.955 --> 39:35.290
We'll look after those two.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.335
Bobbi could use a good cause.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.879
Thank you, Lance Hunter.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.507
Just make sure he gets back okay.

39:48.762 --> 39:49.805
Well...

39:50.222 --> 39:51.264
I guess this is it.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.975
I've had a hell of a time, as always.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.395
I guess I underestimated your odds.

40:02.943 --> 40:04.152
Don't die out there, mate.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.159
- All right.
- Yep.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.161
Okay. Yep.

40:34.141 --> 40:35.934
I love you.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.520
I know.

41:19.561 --> 41:20.729
Good morning, Fitz.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.522
Rise and shine.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.006
While you were asleep,
I had time to put a plan in motion.

41:51.551 --> 41:54.095
We have a few days
before we arrive at the Lighthouse.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.264
That should give me enough time
to prepare you.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.477
Prepare me for what?

42:01.561 --> 42:04.397
For facing off
against some of the most ruthless

42:04.564 --> 42:08.777
and brutal mobsters,
monsters, and mercenaries in the galaxy.

42:11.071 --> 42:12.447
I hope you have it in you.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.453
I have it in me.
