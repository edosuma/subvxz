00:02.570 --> 00:06.005
(dog barking in distance)

00:11.112 --> 00:13.312
(suspenseful violin music)
- [ed] hello?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.246
Oh my god.

00:15.383 --> 00:19.852
(suspenseful violin music)

00:19.954 --> 00:22.087
- [operator] 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:22.189 --> 00:23.022
- [ed] it's my wife.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.759
She's gone and everything's...

00:26.861 --> 00:27.726
Oh my god.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.061
- [operator] sir?

00:29.163 --> 00:31.163
Sir, can you explain
to me what's happening?

00:31.265 --> 00:34.333
- [ed] I don't know
what's happened.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.468
There's blood everywhere.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.204
And she's not here.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.442
- [operator] I'm sending
them out right away.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.910
- She's not here.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.313
My wife's not here.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.216
(mysterious music)

01:04.632 --> 01:08.534
okay well, can you

01:08.836 --> 01:10.369
give that one to mommy?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.137
- Thank you.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.138
- [kayla] you're welcome.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.239
- You wanna taste it?

01:14.341 --> 01:15.207
Just a little bit?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.008
- No.

01:16.110 --> 01:16.942
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.143
Cereal it is.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.579
- Come here.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.580
There we go.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.815
- You have surgery today?

01:22.917 --> 01:26.085
- Yeah, just one
with my new interns.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.020
Did you have any
luck with the sitter?

01:28.122 --> 01:29.154
- No.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.589
My sister said
that she'll do it,

01:30.691 --> 01:32.891
so I figured I'd bring her
back here after we go shopping.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.359
- [kayla] aunt leigh?

01:34.462 --> 01:35.928
- Yes, auntie leigh.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.262
And she can't wait to see you.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.331
- Kayla, I will see
you after school, okay?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.165
- Okay.

01:40.267 --> 01:40.999
- See you.

01:41.102 --> 01:41.800
- Have a good day.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.734
- You too.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.939
(sirens ring)

01:47.041 --> 01:47.973
- [ed] there it is.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.242
The privilege of every
heart surgeon,

01:50.344 --> 01:51.844
to be able to hold the
lives of our patients

01:51.946 --> 01:53.612
in our very hands,

01:53.714 --> 01:56.582
to have the opportunity
to be either a savior

01:56.684 --> 01:57.649
or a failure.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.920
That's why this opportunity
should not be taken lightly.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.355
And why mistakes

02:03.457 --> 02:05.924
are never an option.

02:06.026 --> 02:06.992
Understood?.

02:08.129 --> 02:08.994
Good.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.030
Let's save a life.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.267
(inspirational music)

02:19.173 --> 02:20.672
- [woman] maybe he has a 1
o'clock appointment

02:20.774 --> 02:21.573
available for me?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.475
- All right.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.812
- Good morning.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.247
- Hey.
- You're here early.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.215
- Did you get the
revised designs?

02:30.317 --> 02:34.219
- I actually was getting ready
to look at them right now.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.654
- Remember this?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.524
Client just called.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.125
Said it's been the
most successful

02:40.227 --> 02:42.828
product launch in their
company's history.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.899
Another reason why your award
tonight is so well-deserved.

02:47.001 --> 02:47.833
- Aw.

02:48.969 --> 02:49.801
I love it.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.271
We can pop it open
during lunch today

02:52.373 --> 02:53.505
and everyone could have a drink.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.340
- Oh no, that's yours.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.210
This is all your genius.

03:00.247 --> 03:03.215
But, I'll see you tonight then.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.750
Maybe we'll raise a glass then?

03:04.852 --> 03:05.851
- Of course.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.487
(light guitar music)

03:08.589 --> 03:10.389
- [ed] I feel better already.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.690
Thank you, doctor.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.858
- You're welcome.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.861
I'm gonna give you
your temperature.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.330
- What it say?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.164
- 100.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.098
- [ed] 100?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.600
Well, that's more like you.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.235
- Well, I have a
waitressing interview.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.503
Yes.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.772
And I have another one
at that hotel on fifth?

03:26.874 --> 03:27.906
As a front desk clerk.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.174
Don't make a big deal.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.342
- But see, that's
a good thing why we

03:30.444 --> 03:31.777
run out and got
you these clothes.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.945
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [ed] do I need more medicine?

03:33.047 --> 03:35.347
- Wait a minute, what
is going on in here?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.348
(man chuckles)
hi!

03:36.450 --> 03:37.783
- Aunt leigh!

03:37.885 --> 03:38.684
- Hi!

03:40.454 --> 03:41.353
Hi baby girl!

03:41.455 --> 03:42.321
- Hi!

03:42.423 --> 03:43.121
- Hey!

03:43.224 --> 03:43.956
- [ed] hey.

03:44.058 --> 03:44.890
- So what's going on?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.358
- We're giving daddy a check-up.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.693
- I got an idea.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.895
How 'bout you pack all
of this up for my place

03:49.997 --> 03:52.698
so these two can get ready
for mommy's big night?

03:52.800 --> 03:53.498
Yeah?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.299
(giggles)

03:54.401 --> 03:55.634
- [leigh] yeah, let's do it!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.603
Ed, you have to see
this dress she just got.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.004
It is smoking.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.606
Come on, come on, come on.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.040
She's so modest.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.843
Smoking, right?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.278
- Wow.
- [leigh] yeah.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.913
I thought it was you
doing the shopping.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.514
- See, that's
exactly what I said.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.984
- Well, you had to wear a
hand-me-down to your graduation.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.719
And look, I know you
dreamed of wearing a dress

04:13.821 --> 04:15.520
like this for your
valedictorian speech,

04:15.623 --> 04:17.623
so you owed it to your 18
year old self to buy it.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.258
Don't be so hard on yourself.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.027
But trust me, once you see
her in it, you will thank me.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.962
- Jade, I didn't know
you were valedictorian.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.097
- [leigh] of course she was.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.064
Come on, little one.

04:26.166 --> 04:26.865
- Wait.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.699
There we go.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.067
Goodbye doctor.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.936
- Have fun with your tt.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.004
- Thank you.

04:32.106 --> 04:32.971
- Love you.

04:33.073 --> 04:33.972
I'll see you later, ed.

04:34.074 --> 04:34.806
- See you.
- See you later, sis.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.541
- Wait, wait, wait!

04:38.812 --> 04:39.978
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.317
- Guess I'd better go get ready.

- Rob.

- Sorry.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.699
Never touched the stuff.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.768
- [rob] come on,
it's the after party.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.770
- [ed] gotta keep
the hand steady.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.205
- Well, not me.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.673
In fact, I'm gonna see
about getting another bottle

07:21.775 --> 07:23.442
so we can all toast.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.215
- What an ass.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.119
I don't know how you can
stand to work for him.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.389
You and I have a
special day coming up.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.625
- That's right.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.593
10 years.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.464
- Would you like to
celebrate it like last year,

07:45.566 --> 07:48.533
at chateau briond at alouette?

07:48.635 --> 07:52.103
- Well, it's your
favorite, so of course.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.540
- Before we crack this
one, jade, a few words?

07:55.642 --> 07:56.975
- No.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.743
I already gave my long-winded
speech at the ceremony.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.078
(guests protest)

08:00.180 --> 08:01.680
- we want more!

08:01.782 --> 08:02.781

08:02.883 --> 08:05.417
- Okay, all right,
all right, all right!

08:05.519 --> 08:09.421
Well first, my team has
to come up here with me.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.190
Wow.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.293
This award may
have my name on it,

08:15.395 --> 08:16.895
but everybody knows
that marketing

08:16.997 --> 08:18.964
is a collaborative effort,

08:19.066 --> 08:21.433
so if I could put
your names on it

08:21.535 --> 08:23.235
or if could split it into three,

08:23.337 --> 08:27.606
I would because I can't do
what I do without you guys.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.074
- Well said.
- To jade, yes?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.242
To jade!

08:30.344 --> 08:32.878
(guests cheer)

08:34.047 --> 08:35.881
- you're the best.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.616
- Thank you.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.050
Thank you.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.486
(cheers and applause)

08:41.588 --> 08:44.289
oh, exactly.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.191
Absolutely.
Thanks guys.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.859
- Okay, love you too.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.102
It looks like leigh
and kay had a good time.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.606
- Hey look, in the future,

09:01.708 --> 09:03.108
I want someone else
to look after kayla.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.976
- But ed, she's good.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.113
- Jade, don't be naive.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.214
Your sister's been
back in your life

09:09.316 --> 09:10.549
for a few months and bipolar's

09:10.651 --> 09:14.085
hard to manage, even
with meds, all right?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.759
- Yeah, okay.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.795
(mysterious music)

09:34.441 --> 09:36.575
- you seem to give that

09:37.377 --> 09:39.678
liam, quite a lot of
credit tonight.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.112
- Oh, he's just
part of the team.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.648
I gave them both credit.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.586
- Then why couldn't he wait
to get his hands on you?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.554
And you just let him.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.790
Jade, it was humiliating.

09:54.695 --> 09:58.129
- It's just work
colleague, you know?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.064
Liam, jen.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.168
(foreboding music)

10:03.270 --> 10:04.970
- you think he's better
than me, don't you?

10:05.072 --> 10:05.904
- No!

10:06.006 --> 10:08.073
- Just tell me the truth.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.007
You think I'm stupid?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.175
- No!

10:10.277 --> 10:11.109
- You thought I
don't know why you

10:11.211 --> 10:12.277
begged me to go back to work!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.379
- I just needed to work.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.848
It helps me.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.249
- Here we go.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.485
That's right, poor,
depressed jade.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.853
You don't seem to remember that

10:21.955 --> 10:23.922
I'm the one who was
there looking after you

10:24.024 --> 10:25.223
when you had nothing!

29:46.585 --> 29:48.318
one day, we were
at a friend's house

29:50.289 --> 29:51.488

him on something,

30:02.234 --> 30:03.801
And I rationalized it.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.068
You know, I rationalized it

30:05.171 --> 30:06.870
to his mother always
cutting him down

Jade, no, if that's the case,

30:46.312 --> 30:48.145
you have no choice but
to go to the police.

for you to get out of here.

history of depression?

39:48.086 --> 39:49.786
It started after
her parents died.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.956
I helped her get
it under control

39:53.058 --> 39:57.160

noticed her spiraling again.

39:57.262 --> 39:58.862

alcohol in the house.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.701

40:04.803 --> 40:05.869

40:05.971 --> 40:07.370

into the station.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.105

recently confided

40:09.207 --> 40:11.374

during your marriage.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.343
In fact, she said jade thought

40:13.445 --> 40:15.211
you were trying to
have her killed.

40:16.214 --> 40:19.149
(ominous music)

1:00:40.037 --> 1:00:43.538
(sirens wailing in background)

1:00:43.641 --> 1:00:44.506
jade.

1:00:45.709 --> 1:00:49.578
(sirens wailing in background)

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:53.815
jade?

1:00:54.918 --> 1:00:57.619
(dramatic music)

1:01:01.725 --> 1:01:04.259
(gasping)

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:09.431
- ed! Ed! Ed!

1:01:09.533 --> 1:01:12.200
(gasping)

1:01:14.338 --> 1:01:15.404
- diana.

1:01:15.506 --> 1:01:16.672
I didn't, I didn't
know it was you.

1:01:16.774 --> 1:01:18.306
I didn't.
- Look.

1:01:18.409 --> 1:01:19.474
I'm so sorry.

1:01:19.576 --> 1:01:20.575
I just wanted to
make you some dinner.

1:01:20.678 --> 1:01:23.078
- You look, you
look just like her.

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:24.513
- I should go.

1:01:24.615 --> 1:01:25.447
- [ed] hey! Hey!

1:01:25.549 --> 1:01:27.582
- Ed, please let go of me.

1:01:29.787 --> 1:01:33.555
(footsteps retreating)

1:01:33.657 --> 1:01:36.692
(ed sighing)

1:01:36.794 --> 1:01:39.428
(phone ringing)

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:46.668
- what is it?

1:01:46.770 --> 1:01:50.605
(police chatter in background)

1:01:55.679 --> 1:01:59.014
(soft suspenseful music)

1:02:07.057 --> 1:02:07.789
sean.

1:02:07.891 --> 1:02:08.757
- Hmm?

1:02:09.626 --> 1:02:10.425
- Hey.

1:02:11.361 --> 1:02:12.594
- Uh.

1:02:12.696 --> 1:02:14.463
All right, so listen.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.833
Have you been drinking?

1:02:17.935 --> 1:02:19.568
- I'm just, I'm
just tired, sean.

1:02:19.670 --> 1:02:21.069
- Okay.

1:02:21.171 --> 1:02:21.870
Um.

1:02:21.972 --> 1:02:22.771
- Dr. Thompson.

1:02:22.873 --> 1:02:24.973
Um, why don't we go upstairs?

1:02:25.909 --> 1:02:27.042
- Yeah, come on.

1:02:27.144 --> 1:02:28.076
- What is this?

1:02:31.315 --> 1:02:32.948
- Ed, someone sent
in some photos.

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:43.358
- Is that the tattoo you
told us your wife has

1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:45.026
when you gave us a description?

1:02:46.497 --> 1:02:48.396
- Who sent this?

1:02:48.499 --> 1:02:51.767
- The number couldn't be
traced, but we're workin' on it.

1:02:51.869 --> 1:02:54.202
- Ed, we need you to
confirm it with us.

1:02:54.304 --> 1:02:55.403
Is that jade's tattoo?

1:02:57.374 --> 1:03:00.742
(soft suspenseful music)

1:03:03.547 --> 1:03:04.346
- yeah.

1:03:11.989 --> 1:03:12.954
There are more?

1:03:15.993 --> 1:03:16.825
- A few.

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:19.161
- [ed] show me.

1:03:19.263 --> 1:03:20.295
- Oh, come on, ed,
that's not a good idea.

1:03:20.397 --> 1:03:23.865
- Show me!
(hand thumping)

1:03:23.967 --> 1:03:27.035
(soft dramatic music)

1:03:37.748 --> 1:03:40.415
- based on your identification
and these images,

1:03:40.517 --> 1:03:43.852
it's likely we won't
find her alive.

1:03:45.222 --> 1:03:47.522
Although without a body,
we can never be sure, but-

1:03:47.624 --> 1:03:49.124
- look at this!

1:03:49.226 --> 1:03:50.692
She has to be dead!

1:03:51.995 --> 1:03:53.228
How can you not be sure?

1:03:55.566 --> 1:03:56.364
- We, uh.

1:03:58.001 --> 1:04:02.771
Yeah, you should be prepared
that she's, uh, she's dead.

1:04:03.273 --> 1:04:05.740
(dramatic music)

1:04:10.681 --> 1:04:12.514
(door slamming)

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:16.117
- daddy?

1:04:19.256 --> 1:04:20.055
Daddy?

1:04:21.859 --> 1:04:23.558
Can I have some more juice?

1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:24.626
- Yeah, of course.

1:04:26.864 --> 1:04:28.230
- [kayla] daddy, you
spilled it, daddy.

1:04:28.332 --> 1:04:29.097
- I know.

1:04:31.902 --> 1:04:33.768
Look, kayla, daddy's
gotta go to work.

1:04:33.871 --> 1:04:35.003
- Okay.

1:04:35.105 --> 1:04:37.239
- So can you, um, go
and get your school bag?

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:41.810
And kelly is gonna come
take you to school.

1:04:41.912 --> 1:04:42.711
- But I don't want kelly-

1:04:42.813 --> 1:04:43.879
- just do it!

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:46.248
Look.

1:04:47.651 --> 1:04:50.051
Daddy's just tired and I need
you to listen to me, okay?

1:04:50.153 --> 1:04:51.086
Just go and get your bag.

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:51.853
- Okay.

1:04:51.955 --> 1:04:52.787
- Thank you.

1:05:00.631 --> 1:05:02.097
(knock on door)

1:05:02.199 --> 1:05:02.998
come in.

1:05:11.141 --> 1:05:11.873
- Hi.

1:05:11.975 --> 1:05:13.108
Is kayla ready?

1:05:13.210 --> 1:05:15.043
- She's just going
to get her bag.

1:05:15.145 --> 1:05:16.845
She'll be right down.

1:05:16.947 --> 1:05:18.413
- [kelly] I saw on the news.

1:05:18.515 --> 1:05:19.814
Are you and kayla okay?

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:23.318
- We're fine.

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:26.554
Thank you.

1:05:26.657 --> 1:05:28.023
I'll see you tonight, okay?

1:05:28.125 --> 1:05:28.823
- Okay.

1:05:28.926 --> 1:05:29.824
- Thank you, kelly.

1:08:36.379 --> 1:08:38.546
Just saw the news this morning.

1:08:38.648 --> 1:08:40.181
If I'd known, well...

1:08:45.755 --> 1:08:47.722
We got lucky your team
stepped up just now,

1:08:47.824 --> 1:08:49.324
but it can't happen again.

1:08:49.426 --> 1:08:50.692
Take a leave.

1:08:50.794 --> 1:08:52.093
You need it.

1:08:52.195 --> 1:08:53.394
- Peter, no.

1:08:53.497 --> 1:08:55.530
Look, it was just today.

1:08:55.632 --> 1:08:57.632
I mean, I'll be fine.

- No, you're not.

1:09:00.604 --> 1:09:01.736
I can see it.

And no one's blaming
you, but it's a problem.

you'd be losing your license

disappeared from her home

1:09:40.076 --> 1:09:41.943
under suspicious circumstances,

1:09:42.045 --> 1:09:45.680
and who police now believe has
fallen victim to foul play.

1:09:45.782 --> 1:09:48.783
Her sister, who is organizing
the vigil, had this to say.

1:09:48.885 --> 1:09:52.020

you know who you are,

1:09:54.391 --> 1:09:56.824
you killed a beautiful soul

I haven't seen him.

But, uh, but to
tell you the truth,

1:16:12.368 --> 1:16:14.702
he hasn't really been
himself lately, so.

1:16:14.804 --> 1:16:16.237

1:16:31.220 --> 1:16:32.086

I, um, have a few

1:16:48.104 --> 1:16:51.973
I have a few words
that I'd like to read

1:16:52.075 --> 1:16:53.240

1:16:57.947 --> 1:17:00.281
Jade used to think
she can do anything.

1:17:02.285 --> 1:17:03.150
And she could.

1:17:04.921 --> 1:17:06.754
She was unstoppable.

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:11.559
Then one day we
lost our parents,

1:17:14.330 --> 1:17:16.931
and there was nothing
she could do about that.

1:17:17.033 --> 1:17:18.432
It broke her.

1:17:18.534 --> 1:17:19.900
It broke both of us.

1:17:21.771 --> 1:17:23.070
And then she met ed,

1:17:24.374 --> 1:17:26.040
the savior of lives.

1:17:26.142 --> 1:17:27.441
Jade had it all again.

1:17:28.878 --> 1:17:30.678
A career where she could shine.

1:17:32.148 --> 1:17:33.914
A loving, beautiful daughter.

1:17:36.519 --> 1:17:38.019
And then she had ed,

1:17:39.522 --> 1:17:41.055
her steady hand.

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:45.960
(soft dramatic music)

1:17:46.062 --> 1:17:47.695

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:51.799
Hmm?

1:17:51.901 --> 1:17:54.635
Because even saviors like
you can be haunted by ghosts.

1:17:54.737 --> 1:17:56.137
And those ghosts?

1:17:56.239 --> 1:17:58.139
They will multiply
and they will grow

1:17:58.241 --> 1:18:00.274
and they will never
leave you alone.
