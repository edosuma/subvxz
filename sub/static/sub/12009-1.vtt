00:01.982 --> 00:04.461
Name?
Marcus. Marcus what?

00:04.462 --> 00:07.062
Marcus Phillipus Valerius Gallo.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.593
No. You're not on here.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.853
OK, try Stylax Rufus Eurisces.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.768
Don't think so.
Maybe as a plus-one.

00:14.876 --> 00:16.755
Whose plus-one?
Who have your got?

00:16.756 --> 00:19.355
Back off. You're not on the scroll,
so it's ten each.

00:19.356 --> 00:22.155
Ten denarii?
One of us is just a slave, so...

00:22.156 --> 00:24.675
So leave him outside.
Can we leave you outside?

00:24.676 --> 00:26.997
I'd rather not.
He'd rather not, is the thing.

00:27.018 --> 00:28.696
It's dead nippy.

00:28.697 --> 00:31.337
Evening, ladies.
You have yourselves a good night.

00:31.338 --> 00:33.896
OK, so we sort of need to get in.

00:33.897 --> 00:36.937
Look, gents, I'm not sure this is
the place for guys like you.

00:36.938 --> 00:38.616
What does that mean?

00:38.617 --> 00:41.257
Do I need to spell it out for you?

00:42.266 --> 00:57.349

01:02.977 --> 01:05.695
Salve, Marcus.
All right, landlord?

01:05.707 --> 01:07.766
I've just got some new tenants
fresh off the boat.

01:07.865 --> 01:10.704
Oh, yeah? What they like? Brilliant.
They're paying 60 a week.

01:10.780 --> 01:14.301
I meant as people. Well, idiots,
clearly. Make them feel welcome.

01:20.901 --> 01:22.741
Here, let me give you a hand
with that.

01:22.742 --> 01:25.500
Oh, thanks. I literally love you.

01:25.501 --> 01:28.141
Erm... I love you, too.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.540
I'm Marcus. I live upstairs.

01:31.541 --> 01:33.900
So do I, I think. Cynthia.

01:33.901 --> 01:37.460
This place is a dump.
This is my slave, Metella.

01:37.461 --> 01:39.979
Hello. And goodbye.
We're not staying here.

01:39.980 --> 01:42.699
Oh, no. Really?
What? No, you should stay.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.099
It's dirtier than home, Cynth.
Where's home?

01:45.100 --> 01:47.699
Britain.
Where we live in huts made of mud.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.221
What is dirtier than mud?
Dog shit on our doorstep.

01:50.222 --> 01:52.500
Oh, gross. That really is dirty.

01:52.501 --> 01:55.619
Yeah, but the dog that did that
is actually pretty cute, so...

01:55.620 --> 01:59.021
Still not great. Thanks so much for
your help. I'll tell you what.

01:59.022 --> 02:02.460
I'll get my slave to clean up
the dog business.

02:02.461 --> 02:04.901
When you've settled in
I'll give you a tour of the hood.

02:04.902 --> 02:07.540
Yeah?
We could use a tour guide.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.381
Well, then. Done deal.

02:10.541 --> 02:12.259
So, are you a native Roman, Marcus?

02:12.260 --> 02:14.539
Pretty much.
I've been here about six weeks.

02:14.540 --> 02:17.701
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Brilliant idea. You'll love it here.

02:23.021 --> 02:25.299
Anything from home?
No. Just junk.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.981
What took you? Just helping
some new neighbours move in.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.100
Couple of Britons.
Girls?

02:30.101 --> 02:32.060
No, boys. Big boys.

02:32.061 --> 02:33.819
In fact, Grumio, I need you

02:33.820 --> 02:37.061
to clean up some dog shit
form outside their door, OK? Not OK.

02:37.062 --> 02:41.140
Right. Why not? It's not our shit
or our dog or our door.

02:41.141 --> 02:43.979
That's not the attitude, mate.
We're not on the farm anymore.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.859
We're in Rome now. If we want to
impress people, we've got to -

02:46.860 --> 02:50.061
Pick up their dog shit?
Well, in this case, yes.

02:50.062 --> 02:52.221
Oh, my bloody wow!
What?

02:54.172 --> 02:55.891
An orgy?

02:55.892 --> 02:59.251
The Followers of Flesh,
a feast for the senses.

02:59.252 --> 03:01.891
No, thank you.
As simple as that?

03:01.892 --> 03:04.811
Not for me.
Orgies aren't for you?

03:04.812 --> 03:06.891
OK, what about her?

03:06.892 --> 03:08.930
Is she not for you?
That's a drawing.

03:08.931 --> 03:11.130
It's based on someone.
Someone who won't be there.

03:11.141 --> 03:13.540
You wanted to meet girls.
I wanted a girlfriend.

03:13.541 --> 03:16.300
You might meet her. I don't want
to meet my future wife

03:16.301 --> 03:18.462
while she's being humped
by centurions.

03:18.463 --> 03:20.822
So, wait till they've finished.

03:21.822 --> 03:23.421
How much is it?

03:23.422 --> 03:27.122
It's... It's reassuringly expensive,
but we can make cutbacks.

03:27.212 --> 03:28.570
Where?

03:28.571 --> 03:31.209
Groceries we can cut back, right?
Not really.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.769
We're prioritising orgies over food?
It says "feast".

03:33.770 --> 03:37.771
For the senses. That won't be an -
There is! There's a bloody buffet!

03:37.772 --> 03:39.690
That sounds hygienic.

03:39.691 --> 03:41.569
It it all you can eat?
I assume so.

03:41.570 --> 03:44.369
You're not going!
I'm not paying for my slave

03:44.370 --> 03:47.371
to bang his way through a buffet!
I want to be a Follower of Flesh.

03:48.411 --> 03:50.290
Oh, come on, mate.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.451
You can do this.
It's only following.

03:52.452 --> 03:54.291
Following flesh.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.411 --> 04:05.809
If that's the only way
you can get your rocks off,

04:05.810 --> 04:07.649
then, frankly, I feel sorry for you.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.729
Where do your get your rocks off,
Aurelius?

04:09.730 --> 04:12.369
Anywhere, mate.
Bars, galleries, the temple.

04:12.370 --> 04:15.131
The temple.
The temple is full of quality women.

04:15.132 --> 04:16.970
On their knees praying.

04:16.971 --> 04:19.850
On their knees, worshipping my rack.

04:19.851 --> 04:23.330
Rack means boobs.
No. Rack is muscles.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.529
You have boobs?
I do not have boobs!

04:25.530 --> 04:28.531
I'm glad to hear it.
Working hard, then, boys?

04:28.532 --> 04:32.010
Always, thank you, Flavia.
I come bearing gifts.

04:32.011 --> 04:35.049
As in more work? Copier,
I need 12 of these double sided

04:35.050 --> 04:37.491
for the business affairs meeting
on Friday.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.290
I have already done these.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.969
You poor thing.
I'd rather not do them again.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.371
And I'd rather not ask you.
They were a bit smudgy.

04:44.372 --> 04:47.410
Like someone had been weeping
on them.

04:47.411 --> 04:50.250
Were you weeping on them?
Er... no.

04:50.251 --> 04:52.529
Oh, sorry, I think I must have...
Cheers, mate.

04:52.530 --> 04:55.691
And here's the old ones for you,
shredder. Have it done by tomorrow.

04:55.692 --> 04:58.530
If poss.
Well, we'll try.

04:58.531 --> 05:01.169
And also succeed
because I will need it by then.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.729
So, let's maybe have no talking
in here.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.851
Straight back, water boy.
Water man.

05:05.852 --> 05:07.691
Straight back!

05:19.411 --> 05:21.210
Salve, Grumio.

05:21.211 --> 05:22.810
All right, landlord?

05:22.811 --> 05:25.809
Working hard, then?
I'm quite stressed, actually.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.169
Yeah, you look it.
Financial worries.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.729
I'm trying to balance my budget
for groceries

05:30.730 --> 05:32.769
with my budget for orgies and that.

05:32.770 --> 05:35.131
Cut back on the groceries.
No brainer.

05:35.132 --> 05:36.850
Cheers, yeah.

05:36.851 --> 05:39.611
Do you know anywhere
I can get food for cheap?

05:39.612 --> 05:42.891
Well, how cheap are we talking?
Like... free.

05:43.931 --> 05:45.691
Yeah, I might, as it happens.

05:46.691 --> 05:47.891
Whiz kid.

05:49.051 --> 05:53.130
Ugh. Well, this is bad food.
Where did you get this mulch?

05:53.131 --> 05:54.849
Landlord showed me a place.

05:54.850 --> 05:58.291
The trick is not to smell it or chew
it, just swallow like a duck.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.409
Am I guaranteed sex?
There must be a catch.

06:03.410 --> 06:06.051
Trust me, they'll be queuing up
for you, mate.

06:06.131 --> 06:08.569
Ah. Male attendees each have
to bring a towel.

06:08.570 --> 06:10.611
We have towels.
And a female guest.

06:14.051 --> 06:16.769
What about them Britons?
Grumio, don't -

06:16.770 --> 06:19.049
You said they were big boys.
Boys with breasts.

06:19.050 --> 06:21.291
I saw them first.
Fit Britons? Fit Britons?

06:21.292 --> 06:23.850
The Britons! Ask them to the orgy.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.290
Er, no. That's er... no.

06:26.291 --> 06:29.289
Well, one's a slave. Sorry.
And I kind of like the other one.

06:29.290 --> 06:32.609
That's perfect. Imperfect.
I'm just getting to know her.

06:32.610 --> 06:35.891
No, don't get to know her. That's
not how it's done in the city.

06:35.892 --> 06:40.410
Girls want guys who are balls out
and sexually liberated, not...

06:40.411 --> 06:43.170
chatty prudes.
I'm not a prude.

06:43.171 --> 06:45.409
I know when you've been fiddling
with yourself

06:45.456 --> 06:47.255
because you make Venus
face the wall.

06:47.256 --> 06:49.817
Well, she makes me self-conscious.
Well, not any more.

06:49.818 --> 06:51.496
Man up.

06:51.497 --> 06:53.536
Get this girl to the orgy.

06:53.537 --> 06:56.055
This is the ideal way to take it
to the next level, bro.

06:56.056 --> 06:57.815
You might be skipping a few levels.

06:57.816 --> 07:01.375
Exactly. Cut to the chase.
That's how Romans roll. Hey!

07:01.376 --> 07:05.017
If she doesn't lie it, she can
get the boat back to rainy Briton.

07:05.018 --> 07:07.296
Britain. It's Britain, you dick.

07:07.297 --> 07:09.656
Britain, Briton, whatever.

07:09.657 --> 07:11.897
If you don't ask her, I will.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.976
All right, fine, I'll ask her.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.976
Just leave her alone.
Good boy.

07:18.977 --> 07:21.535
So, what about you?
Who are you going to take?

07:21.536 --> 07:24.537
Don't worry about me. I've got girls
coming out of my arsehole.

07:28.737 --> 07:31.256
OK, go ahead.

07:31.257 --> 07:35.617
Female members of staff are invited
to an orgy this Friday night -

07:35.618 --> 07:38.176
Yeah, you can't put that in a memo.

07:38.177 --> 07:40.616
Why not?
It's inappropriate.

07:40.617 --> 07:42.376
Has Flavia said so?

07:42.377 --> 07:46.416
Not specifically,
but memos are more for office news.

07:46.417 --> 07:50.136
Fire drills and sponsored swims
and, well, not that.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.095
What if I did it through
the Entertainment Committee?

07:53.096 --> 07:55.615
There is no Entertainment Committee.
I've started one.

07:55.616 --> 07:58.657
Really? And I'd like to send some
memos if that's OK?

07:58.658 --> 08:01.376
Sure. Why not?
Memo No.1.

08:01.377 --> 08:07.296
This Friday there will be...
an office cake bake.

08:07.297 --> 08:08.976
I make a lemon drizzle.

08:08.977 --> 08:11.137
That sounds lovely.
Hang on, don't do that.

08:11.138 --> 08:12.976
Why?
Because of memo No.2.

08:12.977 --> 08:16.817
Due to unforeseen circumstances
the cake bake has been cancelled.

08:17.737 --> 08:19.696
Oh, that's a shame.

08:19.697 --> 08:22.737
I know. I'm gutted.
So thank God for memo No.3.

08:22.738 --> 08:27.416
The cake bake has been replaced
with an orgy.

08:27.417 --> 08:30.136
Great news.
Only girls need apply.

08:30.137 --> 08:32.616
Anything else?
Must bring own towel.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.897
And... send.

08:35.897 --> 08:38.297
Own towel.

08:43.177 --> 08:45.496
So, this is the forum.

08:45.497 --> 08:48.496
Oh, it's so romantic.

08:48.497 --> 08:50.376
I find it very romantic.

08:50.377 --> 08:52.336
A bit crowded.

08:52.337 --> 08:55.975
Britain's practically empty. We've
never really been in a crowd before.

08:55.976 --> 08:58.135
Well, three can be a crowd,
can't it?

08:58.136 --> 09:00.337
So, what's that building, then,
tour guide?

09:00.338 --> 09:03.056
What, with the red... legs?

09:03.057 --> 09:04.975
Columns?
You can also call them legs.

09:04.976 --> 09:08.055
That's a temple or a bank
or something. Which is it?

09:08.056 --> 09:10.095
They'll both take your money,
won't they?

09:10.096 --> 09:11.735
I'll just check in the city guide.

09:11.736 --> 09:14.895
The city guide's useless.
Throw it away. I'm giving you gold.

09:14.896 --> 09:17.615
Nugget's of gold you won't find
in a bloody guide.

09:17.616 --> 09:20.175
You don't know the names
of any buildings. Yeah, but...

09:20.176 --> 09:21.897
Rome for me is about the people.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.976
They're the real buildings...

09:23.977 --> 09:25.736
in a way.

09:25.737 --> 09:28.975
I completely agree. I'm actually
training to be an actress.

09:28.976 --> 09:31.975
Oh, wow. So I need to know
about the real people.

09:31.976 --> 09:33.695
Oh, we can't move for real people.

09:33.696 --> 09:35.697
That's a real homeless man there,
look.

09:35.698 --> 09:39.256
Hey, that's brilliant.
Well, not for him.

09:39.257 --> 09:44.816
Erm... what else? Oh, people urinate
against that wall at night.

09:44.817 --> 09:48.015
Great. Another nugget.
No, no, it's good. Carry on.

09:48.016 --> 09:52.135
Well, as it happens, I'm actually
going to this really Roman thing

09:52.136 --> 09:54.257
tomorrow night if you want to come.
Not you.

09:54.258 --> 09:56.336
What kind of thing?

09:56.337 --> 09:59.336
Er... it's sort of a party.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.456
Coolio.

10:00.457 --> 10:04.136
I should say... it's erm...
It's a what?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.097
It's an or...

10:06.977 --> 10:09.137
awesome party.

10:10.257 --> 10:12.256
OK, coolio.

10:12.257 --> 10:14.976
Coolio. On with the tour.

10:14.977 --> 10:16.976
Over there's a horse.

10:16.977 --> 10:19.137
It's a donkey.
Cool, really glad you came.

10:36.577 --> 10:38.377
All right?

10:39.377 --> 10:42.136
What you got there?
Erm... rubbish.

10:42.198 --> 10:44.717
What are you doing?
Just browsing.

10:44.718 --> 10:46.477
How old's that peach?

10:46.478 --> 10:49.077
It's pretty old.
Can I have it?

10:49.078 --> 10:51.938
Fruit's not one of those things that
improves with age, you realise.

10:52.007 --> 10:54.205
What's in that bag?

10:54.206 --> 10:56.204
Corn on the cob.
I'll take it.

10:56.205 --> 10:59.206
It's without the corn.
Cob's fine. I can use cob.

11:03.486 --> 11:07.525
I saw you earlier
with the hairy stick.

11:07.526 --> 11:10.605
Sweeping. I was sweeping.

11:10.606 --> 11:14.125
I'm Metella.
I'm the slave of Cynthia.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.405
Grumio, off of Marcus.

11:16.406 --> 11:18.684
Of course you are.
That's make perfect sense.

11:18.685 --> 11:22.404
Are you going to his thing on Friday
night, then? No, I'm not invited.

11:22.405 --> 11:24.324
Me neither. I'm not fussed, like.

11:24.325 --> 11:27.564
I want a nap after I've eaten,
and I figured at an orgy

11:27.565 --> 11:30.804
you'd keep getting woken
up by people trying to fuck you.

11:30.805 --> 11:33.806
What did you just say?
Sorry, make love to you.

11:33.807 --> 11:36.046
Are they going to an orgy?

11:38.486 --> 11:40.245
What's in that bag?

11:40.246 --> 11:42.485
Toiletries.

11:42.486 --> 11:44.446
Right, I'll leave that.
Thanks, then.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.666
Shredder, darling, quick word.
Am I in trouble?

11:51.730 --> 11:53.129
Yes.

11:54.889 --> 11:57.447
That's not what internal memos
are for, shredder.

11:57.448 --> 11:59.127
Yeah, I realise that now.

11:59.128 --> 12:02.167
We're not running some kind
of dating service.

12:02.168 --> 12:05.369
No. It's not really dating, though,
it's more kind of...

12:05.370 --> 12:07.268
anonymous humping, really.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.726
That's not much better, is it?
No.

12:10.926 --> 12:13.444
Out of interest,
has there been many replies? No.

12:13.445 --> 12:15.404
Good, I'm pleased about that.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.726
I wanted to test the moral fibre
of our workforce.

12:17.727 --> 12:19.725
Stop it.
Sorry.

12:19.726 --> 12:23.686
Are you going to fire me?
I haven't decided yet.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.886
What was that?
Nothing. Nothing. I panicked.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.605
Just get out. And, shredder?
Yes?

12:39.606 --> 12:42.646
Don't ask anyone else to accompany
you to an orgy? No.

12:42.647 --> 12:45.325
Because I'll be going with you.
Yes.

12:45.326 --> 12:48.886
I'll meet you there at nine.
I have my own... towel.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.806
That'll be all, shredder.

13:02.726 --> 13:05.445
Cob's the best bit.
Well, it isn't.

13:05.446 --> 13:07.924
What's this grey stuff.
That's just general grey.

13:07.925 --> 13:11.846
Where in Rome sells general grey?
The grey's actually pretty good.

13:11.847 --> 13:15.285
It's meaty, but it's also moussey.

13:15.286 --> 13:18.365
It's a meat mousse.
I think I'll leave it.

13:18.366 --> 13:20.165
I'll wait for the buffet.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.284
Are you good to go?
Have you conquered Briton?

13:22.285 --> 13:25.686
I'm telling her in stages.
Today I invited her to a party.

13:25.687 --> 13:28.645
Tomorrow I'll fill her in
on the theme.

13:28.646 --> 13:30.685
Oh, yeah, no need, actually.

13:30.686 --> 13:31.925
Why?

13:31.926 --> 13:34.964
I saw her slave at the bins.
She's probably filled in by now.

13:34.965 --> 13:37.924
Oh, you total dickhead.
I didn't know about the stages.

13:37.925 --> 13:41.766
Hang on, is this from the bins?
Which one are you more angry about?

13:43.086 --> 13:45.926
What's the point of you, Grumio?
I should bloody sell you.

13:45.927 --> 13:48.446
No-one would buy me.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.804
This is what you drive me to.
Do you understand?

13:53.805 --> 13:55.726
I'm not bothered. I completed it.

13:56.406 --> 13:59.326
She might not mind.
Of course she'll mind.

13:59.327 --> 14:01.926
What the hell am I going to tell her?

14:03.566 --> 14:06.966
Are you done with your grey? I think
I'm gonna press on, actually.

14:09.366 --> 14:11.485
You forgot it was an orgy?

14:11.486 --> 14:14.444
I forgot to mention it was an orgy.
When would you have remembered?

14:14.445 --> 14:18.364
When we got there? When we were
surrounded by thrusting dicks?

14:18.365 --> 14:20.766
Before that probably.
She'd have worked it out.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.165
Stay out of it, please, mate.

14:23.166 --> 14:27.525
Look, orgies are just a traditional
Roman pastime.

14:27.526 --> 14:30.524
So, why aren't they in the city
guide? That's just tourist stuff.

14:30.525 --> 14:33.604
This is what the locals do.
The local perverts?

14:33.605 --> 14:36.044
Local normal people.
I bought a new dress

14:36.045 --> 14:39.524
for a naked party. You can wear it
on the way over there.

14:39.525 --> 14:43.166
Look, I know it seems a bit edgy
and you're obviously sheltered.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.325
Pardon me, I'm not sheltered.

14:45.326 --> 14:47.084
You'd never been in a crowd before.

14:47.085 --> 14:49.084
This is modern city living, OK?

14:49.085 --> 14:51.566
If you can't handle it,
maybe you should get back

14:51.567 --> 14:53.926
in your mud hut in soggy Briton.

14:56.526 --> 14:59.005
It's pronounced Britain.

14:59.006 --> 15:02.005
Thought you might lend 'em
some milk.

15:02.006 --> 15:05.644
Not invite them to a bloody orgy.
You heard that, then?

15:05.645 --> 15:07.446
Who's orgy is it, out of interest?

15:07.447 --> 15:10.605
The Followers of Flesh.

15:10.606 --> 15:13.764
The Flesh Followers. Bloody hell!
Why? What's wrong with it?

15:13.765 --> 15:16.484
It's whatever you're into, mate.
I'm not into anything.

15:16.485 --> 15:19.606
It's not entry level.
That one's more for specialists.

15:19.607 --> 15:21.765
What are specialists?

15:21.766 --> 15:24.886
People who specialise.
Yeah, that makes sense.

15:27.006 --> 15:29.284
I shouldn't have told them
to go home.

15:29.285 --> 15:32.804
Those two are a much higher calibre
than my usual twats. No offence.

15:32.805 --> 15:36.244
None taken. Right,
see if I can't calm things down,

15:36.245 --> 15:38.764
smooth a few feathers.
That would be great.

15:38.765 --> 15:40.724
Part of my job description.
I know.

15:40.725 --> 15:44.566
So, another five on this week's
rent. Look after Junior, will you?

15:47.526 --> 15:49.486
'What does "not entry level" mean?'

15:49.487 --> 15:52.205
I don't know. I guess it's kinky.

15:52.206 --> 15:55.126
But kinky how?
Is it more stroking and massaging?

15:55.127 --> 15:57.806
You know, or punching and smearing.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.564
It sounds great.
I wish I could come.

16:00.565 --> 16:02.804
I'm not sure I could handle
the competition.

16:02.805 --> 16:05.446
Oh, trust me, mate, if I was there,
I would clean up.

16:05.447 --> 16:07.285
What, fluids?
No, women.

16:07.286 --> 16:10.166
With a little mop and bucket.
That's very considerate.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.565
I'm saying I could bang everyone.

16:12.566 --> 16:14.885
Good for you, water boy. Aim high.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.524
Thank you. Water man.
Good night, all.

16:17.525 --> 16:20.444
I've finished those copies.
Bravo. Pass them to shredder.

16:20.445 --> 16:23.004
Why? Because the meeting's been
moved to their place,

16:23.005 --> 16:25.046
so they're sorting the copies.
Nighty night.

16:26.726 --> 16:29.205
Oh, shredder, are you... shaved?

16:29.206 --> 16:31.285
Am I...?

16:31.286 --> 16:33.605
Oh, I can be.

16:33.606 --> 16:35.326
If you would.

16:40.326 --> 16:42.404
You're taking her to the orgy,
aren't you?

16:42.405 --> 16:44.484
In many ways she's taking me.
Oh, you idiot.

16:44.485 --> 16:47.044
What? You could literally
shag us out of a job.

16:47.045 --> 16:49.484
We'll get a bonus, if anything. Yow!

16:49.485 --> 16:52.924
Look at me. Answer me honestly.
Are you actually any good at sex?

16:52.925 --> 16:55.286
You talk a good game,
but are you any good at it?

16:55.287 --> 16:57.405
I think so.
You think?

16:57.406 --> 17:00.206
What's the feedback been like?
Never had any complaints.

17:00.207 --> 17:02.165
Well, how about compliments?

17:02.166 --> 17:05.726
Like people do that straight after.
No, further down the line.

17:05.727 --> 17:08.605
Well, once is enough... usually.

17:08.606 --> 17:11.246
That's bad, then.
People are voting with their feet.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.925
Or... they've had the best, so...

17:14.925 --> 17:17.605
So... what? They retire from sex

17:17.606 --> 17:20.685
because it can't get any better
than sex with Stylax, can it?

17:30.326 --> 17:32.245
Hi. I've come to say sorry.

17:32.246 --> 17:34.845
OK, thanks.
Not to you, though.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.245
I'll pass it on.
OK...

17:37.246 --> 17:40.644
Can you tell Cynthia
that I regret deceiving her,

17:40.645 --> 17:43.004
and being rude about her country,
also your country?

17:43.005 --> 17:45.484
If she can for give me,
I'd like to take her for a drink

17:45.485 --> 17:48.564
that won't end in group sex.
OK, I'll tell her.

17:48.565 --> 17:50.924
Don't mention the sex, actually.
Go up to the drink.

17:50.925 --> 17:52.686
In fact, can I just tell her?

17:52.687 --> 17:55.405
Nope.
Sorry, with respect,

17:55.406 --> 17:58.244
I'm not sure you're going to convey
the right emotions

17:58.245 --> 18:00.126
when you do it, so can I...?

18:00.127 --> 18:02.405
She's out.
When's she back?

18:02.406 --> 18:05.125
Dunno.
I think she's gone to an orgy.

18:05.126 --> 18:09.046
That's very funny. Some cretin told
her that she was too sheltered.

18:18.366 --> 18:20.844
Ah, go on, be a mate.
This is appalling.

18:20.845 --> 18:22.684
I've argued her into an orgy.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.484
I don't want to shave your balls.

18:24.485 --> 18:26.404
But I can't get the right angle
myself.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.526
OK, I'll do it if I don't have
to look at 'em.

18:29.527 --> 18:32.006
No, that's... No, I can't risk that.

18:33.086 --> 18:35.525
Maybe let's just forget it.

18:35.526 --> 18:37.324
Let's just have a lads' night in,
yeah?

18:37.325 --> 18:39.924
What? You can't pull out now.
This was you idea.

18:39.925 --> 18:43.724
I need to be there to stop Cynthia
sleeping with another man.

18:43.725 --> 18:46.924
And other men. Exactly, and other
men. These people are specialists.

18:46.925 --> 18:50.204
But we don't know what that means.
It means keep them off her.

18:50.205 --> 18:53.446
Like a human shield.
And how are you gonna do that?

18:53.447 --> 18:55.405
Slide in...

18:55.406 --> 18:57.526
No, I mean you need a female guest.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.606
Oh, fuck pigs!

19:01.566 --> 19:05.804
OK, I've got an idea. And I'll be
honest, Grumio, you won't like it.

19:05.805 --> 19:09.326
However, bear in mind, there will be
a free buffet in it for you.

19:11.486 --> 19:13.165
Don't think so.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.644
Why not?
Because that's clearly a man.

19:15.645 --> 19:19.884
Yeah, fair point. Thing is, we're
not even really here for the sex.

19:19.885 --> 19:22.084
What are you here for, then?
The buffet.

19:22.085 --> 19:26.446
Then, go to a buffet. We do like to
be around sex while we eat, though.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.325
There he is!

19:29.326 --> 19:31.806
All spick and span, I hope,
shredder.

19:31.807 --> 19:34.445
Like a baby's bottom.
And Marcus too!

19:34.446 --> 19:36.886
Hello. This is practically
an office night out.

19:36.887 --> 19:39.165
And is this your partner?

19:39.166 --> 19:41.366
No. That's erm...

19:42.446 --> 19:44.404
There's no explanation
for what that is.

19:44.405 --> 19:47.726
Shredder, this is my husband,
Cressus. Oh, it's your husband.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.325
I thought we were...

19:49.326 --> 19:51.845
Or are we...?

19:51.846 --> 19:54.126
Or even -
This is his goon, Lucinda.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.765
Goon? What's the...? Am I a goon?

19:56.766 --> 19:58.805
Am I your goon?

19:58.806 --> 20:00.924
A goon is chosen for the cage game.
The what?

20:00.925 --> 20:03.006
It's just a fun little game
in a cage.

20:03.007 --> 20:05.565
I like games. Less keen on cages.

20:05.566 --> 20:08.404
Would you stamp my loyalty card,
please, darling?

20:08.405 --> 20:10.404
She's got a fucking loyalty card.

20:10.405 --> 20:14.324
At least she's loyal. Loyal to
orgies. That's the opposite of loyal.

20:14.325 --> 20:16.444
Now he's putting a bag on his head.

20:16.445 --> 20:18.806
I'll try to find a girl
and meet you in there.

20:18.807 --> 20:21.166
Shredder, come along.

20:22.406 --> 20:24.246
These people are specialists.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.886
Orgy? Do you want
to go to an orgy with him?

20:32.887 --> 20:36.085
No? Orgy, anyone?
Stop it, Grumio.

20:36.086 --> 20:38.006
We'll just get arrested.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.804
Do you think Cynthia's
already in there?

20:42.805 --> 20:45.046
It's hard to tell from the outside.

20:46.046 --> 20:47.886
Maybe she's not actually going.

20:48.926 --> 20:50.724
Metella was probably winding me up.

20:50.725 --> 20:53.006
Who would she go with, anyway?
She only knows us.

20:53.007 --> 20:55.965
And the landlord.
Yeah, exactly.

20:55.966 --> 20:57.964
She's hardly going to go
with a landlord.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.326
OK, that's them.
That's clearly what she's done.

21:03.806 --> 21:06.046
Shit house!

21:08.046 --> 21:10.485
Are you all right?

21:10.486 --> 21:12.885
Well, we're broke.

21:12.886 --> 21:16.165
The girl I fancy is at an orgy
with a landlord.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.166
My best friend's being molested
in a cage.

21:20.406 --> 21:22.726
And my slave's pissing on my foot.

21:24.046 --> 21:26.326
At least we're in Rome, though.

21:42.206 --> 21:43.726
No, thank you.

21:48.846 --> 21:50.605
OK.

21:50.606 --> 21:53.806
I don't like the cage game!

21:53.931 --> 22:23.680
