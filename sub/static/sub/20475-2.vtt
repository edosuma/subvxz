"While endless depictions

07:29.658 --> 07:33.995

To be fair, <i>"Pastiche,</i> bad.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.418

07:40.502 --> 07:42.629

07:42.712 --> 07:43.546
This is what they are.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.383

08:06.861 --> 08:10.532
I really don't subscribe
to those kinds of labels.

-Cool. Cool.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.596
You're Troy's roommate, right?

Do you know if he's dating anyone?

09:58.056 --> 09:59.724
I mean, has he said anything?

09:59.808 --> 10:02.143
I really just keep to myself.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.729
So he doesn't talk about who he's dating.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.690
You be sure to let me know if he does.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.275
-Okay.
-Thanks, sweets.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.778
You're the best. Heart you forevs.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.750
[woman] Yeah. Mmm, right there.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.212
-[Troy] You gonna vote for Troy?
-[woman] Oh, yes.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.588
-[Troy] You gonna vote for Troy?
-[woman] Yeah.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.048
-[Troy] All right, baby.
-[woman] Yes.

10:32.132 --> 10:32.966
[Troy] I wasn't ready.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.510
-[Troy] Now I am. Oh, shit.
-[woman] Mmm, right there.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.096
Give it to me. Harder, yeah!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.347
-[Troy] Just like that!
-Harder.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.057
-[Troy] Uh-huh!
-Mmm, you like that?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.350
-[Troy] Oh! Shit!
-I know you like that.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.186
-[woman] You love that, baby, don't you?
-I'm ready.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.312
[woman] Give it to me there.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.148
-[Troy] Oh, baby. Oh, shit.
-Mmm, yeah.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.316
-[Troy] You gonna vote for Troy.
-I'll vote for you.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.360
[Troy] Does it feel good? Did you cum?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.653
-[Troy] 'Cause I'm about to cum.
-[grunting]

10:53.736 --> 10:55.155
[Troy] Did you cum? I'm about to cum.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.406
-[woman] No, not yet.
-Oh!

10:56.489 --> 10:59.534
[woman] Yeah, yeah, yes!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:59.617 --> 11:00.785

14:56.396 --> 14:57.688
Forgot something?

[sighs]

15:00.900 --> 15:02.235
[Lionel] Thanks.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.569
I'm Conner.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.196
This is Becca.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.614
Hey.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.117
You're all kinds of cute.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.078
Lionel. Nice to meet you.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.997
I'm gonna head back to the place.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.040
Cool.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.046
Girlfriend?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.256
More of a roommate...

15:23.923 --> 15:25.091
with benefits.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.261
I don't know, though.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.847
I love the ladies, but...

15:31.556 --> 15:35.101
I don't exactly subscribe
to heteronormative labels.

15:51.909 --> 15:52.952
[coughs]

15:55.163 --> 15:57.498
You into girls, guys?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.250
It's a theater party.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.293
Gotta ask.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.879
[exhales]

16:04.088 --> 16:05.381
Kind of like you.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.468
Don't really buy into labels.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.305
[sighs]

16:12.388 --> 16:14.724
You should come back to the place.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.267
Drink a few beers.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.894

16:26.861 --> 16:28.279
[Conner] Who are these fuckheads

16:28.362 --> 16:31.741
who don't know anything about the history
of minstrelsy in this country?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.743
-[Lionel] Exactly.
-What's this?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.913
[Conner] <i>Pastiche</i> threw a blackface party
over the weekend.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.540
[Becca] Like Zoe Saldana or Al Jolson?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.751
Like black paint on their faces.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.753
[Becca] That kind of thing
doesn't happen here.

16:43.836 --> 16:48.799
It did, Becca, and our dude Lionel here
helped bust it up.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.760
I'm so not that guy either.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.929
I mean, I just couldn't not do something.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.056
White people are the fucking worst.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.682
[Conner] Right?

16:56.766 --> 16:59.560
What's fucked up is,
on one hand, I get it.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.021
I mean, we're all just
fucking human beings.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.358
Our skin, our eyes,
our fucking genitalia...

17:05.441 --> 17:07.735
it's all a mask, you know?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.779
-[phone ringing]
-[scoffs]

17:09.862 --> 17:11.948
Don't tell me you gotta go.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.533
No, I'm good.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.535
Good.

17:19.664 --> 17:20.998
You don't mind, do you?

17:21.666 --> 17:23.376
I get super handsy when I smoke.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.377
[laughs]

17:24.460 --> 17:27.171
I, uh, just get cotton mouth

17:27.255 --> 17:28.464
and nightmares.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.092
[Conner] Hey, so...

17:31.175 --> 17:32.218
Lionel.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.972
Becca and I really dig you.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.640
Cool.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.518
Do you like us, Lionel?

17:42.270 --> 17:43.521
Yeah?

17:43.604 --> 17:45.398
[Conner] Are you...

17:45.481 --> 17:46.899
up for some fun?

17:47.817 --> 17:48.734
Fun?

17:49.777 --> 17:50.903
Fun.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.390
Anybody ever tell you
you look like Wiz Khalifa?

18:19.473 --> 18:20.558
No.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.022
[Becca] Do you want to fuck me, Lionel?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.773
Oh, yeah.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.233
He wants to fuck you.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.986
How bad do you want to fuck me, Lionel?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.030
Uh, bad.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.240
Oh, shit.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.867
He wants it bad.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.327
[Becca] Yeah?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.370
You want me, Lionel?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.166
Do you want to taste me?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.672
Yeah, he wants to taste you.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.674
Well, he's just gonna have to earn it,
isn't he?

18:53.758 --> 18:56.177
What's he gonna have to do, baby?

18:56.260 --> 18:59.639
I want to see the two of you together.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.975
[laughs] Oh, shit.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.062
Are you even down with that?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.482
[laughing]

19:09.565 --> 19:10.524
What?

19:10.608 --> 19:14.445
"Are you even down with that?"
[chuckling]

19:14.528 --> 19:18.032
Look, you don't need
the wingwoman, okay?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.701
You're obviously just into guys.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.912
And you...

19:22.995 --> 19:25.581
I'm not sure what you're getting out
of this.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.957
He's right.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.959
Becca. This was your idea.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.087
I said I thought it might be hot

19:31.170 --> 19:33.506
to see you make out with a guy once
at a party.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.926
Not multiple guys
over the course of two years.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.386
I'm a total fag hag.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.512
No labels, Becca.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.721
That was our rule.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.558
Yeah, without labels, people in Florida
would drink fucking Windex.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.060
Becca, come on.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.771
You totally ruined the mood!

19:49.313 --> 19:50.231
[sighs]

19:50.314 --> 19:51.524
She's off her meds.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.526
I'll work this out.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.694
I'm good.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.405
Dude, where were you?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.739
[Lionel] The speakeasy.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.491
Lost my phone. Took a while to find it.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.619
Shit, and you were all by yourself
with the theater freaks.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.622
How many white fingers
did that poor 'fro have to endure?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.748
Looks mussed.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.583
It's been an interesting night.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.544
So what's the fire?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.796
I knew there was more to the story
with the <i>Pastiche</i> party.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.172
Look at this.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.718
The dean's office is privately
interviewing students involved.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.970
These are the transcripts
from all the interviews.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.472
Okay, you hacked into the dean's office?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.765
That's a thing you can do?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.350
Well, not me.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.894
Some CS major ran
a redirected shell script

20:28.978 --> 20:30.563
to analyze the active network interface,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.773
routed all the HTTP traffic to a proxy

20:32.857 --> 20:33.858
and linked it to me.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.276
Makes sense.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.570
He also fancies himself
the next Edward Snowden.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.655
He's been trying
to get this Italian sausage

20:39.739 --> 20:41.073
since freshman year.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.284
I thought you were Mexican-Italian.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.828
Fine. Tamale. Whatever.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.080
The <i>Pastiche</i> boys
apparently canceled the event

20:48.164 --> 20:50.332
after the administration got wind of it.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.168
But then somebody broke
into their Facebook account

20:52.251 --> 20:53.711
and sent out an invite anyway.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.755
And we're sure it wasn't one of them?

20:55.838 --> 20:56.881
I'm not.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.176
But I'm hoping the truth is somewhere
in these transcripts.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.720
[sighs]

21:17.109 --> 21:19.612
Why would they want to interview Sam?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.870
[echoing click]

21:27.953 --> 21:29.330
[Dean Fairbanks] Miss White,

21:29.413 --> 21:32.875
do you have any idea what kind of unrest

21:32.958 --> 21:35.753
this party has caused on campus?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.963
Why am I even here?

21:39.131 --> 21:42.051
When I heard the words "race"
and "scandal,"

21:42.134 --> 21:44.303
somehow you popped into my head.

21:46.055 --> 21:49.934
Now, the <i>Pastiche</i> Facebook
account was easy to get into.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.852
Their password was "Pastiche."

21:51.936 --> 21:54.563
Apparently, before the invite
was sent out, however,

21:54.647 --> 21:56.148
the password changed.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.819
And nobody could figure out
the new password.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.948
So I thought I'd try something.

22:07.326 --> 22:12.164
Five, seven, eight, three, five, two, six,

22:12.248 --> 22:14.416
one, nine, four, six.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.459
I get it.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.877
[Dean Fairbanks] Eleven numbers.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.713
Just like our student ID numbers.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.676
Just like <i>your</i> student ID number.

22:24.426 --> 22:28.472
It wasn't speeches that turned the tide
for civil rights.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.266
It was the anarchists,

22:30.349 --> 22:33.978
willing to provoke the police,
get sprayed by hoses...

22:34.061 --> 22:36.814
anything to cause a scene and make press.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.066
That invite,

22:40.192 --> 22:41.735
whoever sent it,

22:42.778 --> 22:45.489
should have been met
with derision and outrage.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.618
Instead, 100 people showed up
and showed their asses,

22:49.702 --> 22:53.414
and in doing so, showed this
supposed post-racial institution

22:53.497 --> 22:55.583
exactly where it's at.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.795
-[echoing click]
-Fuck.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.630
Sam White did it.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.674
Why would she do that?

23:03.757 --> 23:04.884
No one would have found out

23:04.967 --> 23:06.844
about what they were planning
if she hadn't.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.470
This party wouldn't have happened at all

23:08.554 --> 23:09.847
if she hadn't thrown it.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.307
She didn't throw it.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.225
She exposed it.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.519
And if we print this,
people will completely dismiss

23:15.603 --> 23:17.229
what she's been trying to say.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.857
We can't control what people do
with the truth, Lionel.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.317
We can only report it.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.655
-They're gonna hate me.
-Get used to it.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.742
You think that stopped the guys
who broke the Panama Papers

23:29.825 --> 23:32.328
or reported the abuse
of the Catholic church

23:32.411 --> 23:33.954
or the first person to tell that story

23:34.038 --> 23:36.123
about Richard Gere and the gerbil?

23:36.206 --> 23:37.958
We're on the wrong side here.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.335
If you were at that party--

23:39.418 --> 23:43.339
This is a scoop no other paper on campus
would even think about letting you print.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.549
This could be a game changer
for <i>The Independent</i>

23:45.633 --> 23:47.551
and a career maker for you.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.054
I only want writers who have the guts
to tell the truth,

23:50.137 --> 23:52.848
like Will Smith in that football movie
everyone meant to see.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.517
That's why you write, isn't it?

23:58.187 --> 23:59.980
[Gabe] Don't worry.
I'm gonna delete the post.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.607
[Lionel] Sam?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.485
[Sam] Shit.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.781
My editor wants to run with the story
as soon as possible.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.574
But...

24:10.658 --> 24:12.868
if someone else breaks it

24:12.952 --> 24:14.411
before we do...

24:15.829 --> 24:16.997
you know?

24:17.081 --> 24:19.041
You'd ruin your own scoop?

24:19.124 --> 24:22.670
I guess I just don't like the idea
of telling someone else's truth.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.588
[sighs]

24:24.672 --> 24:27.216
Journalism's gonna be a big challenge
for you.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.093
[chuckles] Tell me about it.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.054
I like you, Lionel.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.305
A lot.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.658
[Troy] What's up? You need something?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.660
Yeah, just wanted

24:54.743 --> 24:56.620
to take you up on that haircut.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.038
[Troy] Oh-ho, shit.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.249
Bet, man, bet. Um, one sec.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.542
Meet me at the bathroom.

25:08.924 --> 25:09.842
Come on in.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.176
Hmm.

[Sam] <i>Dear white people, wow.</i>

25:16.515 --> 25:18.142
<i>Y'all really trying it.</i>

25:18.225 --> 25:22.062
[Lionel] Felt so rehearsed
yet very terribly performed.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.189
That sounds like our theater majors.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.151
Hey, man, what are you, a one, two?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.154
I have no idea what that means.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.781
What, you don't know your setting, man?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.032
How short do you want it?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.325
I don't know.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.453
Well, you gotta know your setting.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.871
Ah, two.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.372
Good place to start.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.458
So what did you do?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
Was the chick hot at least?

25:46.545 --> 25:47.713
[sighs]

25:48.547 --> 25:49.965
Troy...

25:50.966 --> 25:52.301
[sighs]

25:52.384 --> 25:53.969
I'm gay.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.308
I don't know why that's so hard
for me to say.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.768
I've always known.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.187
Yo, what you say, my man?

26:06.774 --> 26:08.484
Just...

26:08.567 --> 26:10.778
I'm-- I'm into guys.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.197
Oh.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.408
-Cool.
-Yeah.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.702
Vaginas are, like, art in a museum.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.705
Beautiful to look at, but don't touch.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.749
Yeah, well, agree to disagree.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.003
Now I gotta get these edges super crispy

26:28.086 --> 26:30.714
because you motherfuckers
are picky as shit.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.341
I'm not like that.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.134
Nah.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.719
You're an original, man.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.514
Anybody can see that.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.891
-Want to listen to some music?
-Sure.
