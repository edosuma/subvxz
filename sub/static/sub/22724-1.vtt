00:12.520 --> 00:15.592
Oh no! The 4 is missing!

01:37.880 --> 01:39.279
I'm taking it. Great.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.151
Did it come out? Give it to me.
Bring it over.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.429
Give it to me.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.150
It came out great.
See that?

01:49.440 --> 01:50.953
- You see that?
- No.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.629
OK, off you go.
Now listen up, kids.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.593
Today I'm going to tell you
about the striking techniques...

01:56.880 --> 01:58.472
...of the new generation of
world football players.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.358
But first an overview of football.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.034
Power is everything in football, kids.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.032
Be like a hippo.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.031
Be like a bear.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.112
Show your power on the field.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.758
How are you going to do that?

02:10.919 --> 02:12.717
Look.
What's this?

02:13.080 --> 02:15.150
- A shoe.
- Notjust a shoe!

02:15.480 --> 02:16.754
A weapon, it's a weapon.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.480
The most important weapon in football.
What's this?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.633
- A shoe's toe?
- It's what you use for a toe kick.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.438
Use your toe to kick.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.195
Don't bother with your instep.
Just kick with your toe

02:28.600 --> 02:30.750
- Understand?
- Understood.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.232
The real footballers are
Hami Mandirali... Ünal Karaman.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.275
Ayi Gökmen.
Rambo Yusuf.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.919
Recep from Besiktas.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.038
They reverse shots into their
own goals. But they show power.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.878
Oan you follow me?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.191
- Are you with me so far?
- Yes.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.875
Well then let me demonstrate...

02:51.160 --> 02:53.674
...using Hayrettin.
Hayrettin, go to the goal.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.954
Right, kids.
Are you going to learn toe-kicks?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.475
Yes, we are!

03:01.640 --> 03:04.200
Let's go, little tigers!
Watch closely.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.715
In the name of God.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.354
He's out.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.831
He's out cold. Take
Hayrettin to the hospital.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.752
Leave him at the clinic. Run.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.194
Run.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.835
- Dig up to the corner of that building...
- Stay there.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.918
Right up to the corner...

03:21.160 --> 03:22.673
What's up?

03:22.840 --> 03:26.116
- Recep, your shoe.
- Thanks. Get back to work.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.114
- What are you doing here?
- It's no problem. We're exploring.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.840
What are you exploring?
This is the same old Güngören.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.195
Lf's there's anything to explore
let's do it together.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.590
Sir, we're the property owners.
Ali Bey bought this lot.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.796
We're doing a land survey.
A building's going up here.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.790
Hey!

03:39.960 --> 03:41.712
You might be the owners
but we're the locals!

03:41.880 --> 03:44.314
Are you conning us? This is the only
football field in the neighborhood.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.709
Kids have been playing here for years.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.711
Ibrahim left the lot to us
when I was a kid.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.199
Anyway, he left the neighborhood.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.669
We're talking about the same thing.
Ibrahim has left.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.559
But he's left for good. Poof.
It's just as well he's gone.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.153
He'd be miserable if he
saw what things have come to.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.074
The way his relatives fought
after he died. Oh boy.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.710
All that fighting and
carrying on.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.275
I had to intervene with the help
of the police.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.675
His boss is the rich Ali Alkantara.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.956
I called him and said,
"Oome over here, Ali."

04:11.120 --> 04:13.076
"There's some land with
complications. Buy it," I said.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.113
"I've got no expectations.
Build a multi-storey building on it."

04:16.279 --> 04:18.918
Hey! What's all this about?

04:19.079 --> 04:21.594
I said this, he did that.
What are you trying to say?

04:21.760 --> 04:23.113
- But...
- Shut up.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.072
- I mean...
- Shut up.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.595
You're getting on my nerves.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.716
I won't let anyone build
on this lot.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.316
This is our football field.
I'll talk to this Ali Bey if I have to.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.994
I'll explain it to Ali Bey.
Now take me to Ali Bey.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.031
Get going. I'm following you.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.832
Lead the way.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.352
Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.875
- Are you Ali Alkantara?
- Yes, I'm Ali Alkantara.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.399
I'm Recep Ivedik.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.912
From what I heard,
You've bought our football field.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.798
You've decided to build on it.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.838
I won't let you do that, brother.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.634
We've been playing football there
since I was a boy.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.718
I played ball there, and now
a new generation of kids are playing.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.955
Understand, brother?

05:07.120 --> 05:11.716
That's what I won't let you
build on that lot.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.790
Get that into your head.
- I sank money in that lot.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.399
I made an investment.
Why should I care what you say?

05:16.560 --> 05:20.155
I'll give you such a smack!

05:25.400 --> 05:28.472
Get your dog off me.
I'll speak plainly, Ali.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.519
You might be some kind of mafioso,
but there's nothing I won't do, Ali Bey.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.394
Wise up, Ali Bey.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.793
Don't piss me off, Ali Bey.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.799
I've got ways to get what
I want, too, Ali Bey.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.712
Who cares what you think?
I made an investment.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.478
- I paid good money.
- How much did you pay?

05:45.680 --> 05:47.671
- 250,000.
- I'll give you 300,000.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.670
Sell me that lot.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.876
- Recep, what 300,000?
- Business is business, Nurullah.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.952
We'll play by his rules.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.279
It's all yours.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.636
Take it.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.392
This promissory note must
paid off in three months.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.677
If it's not, I'll take a bulldozer
to the lot.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.629
You're a weird guy.
What are you all about?

06:27.920 --> 06:31.549
Are you a softie or a mafioso,
it's hard to tell.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.233
- You've got 3 months.
- OK, OK.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.789
A promise is a promise.
I'll bring the money within 3 months...

06:35.960 --> 06:37.712
...and the lot is mine, OK?
- OK, the lot's yours.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.155
Now if you'll excuse us.
Get going, Nurullah.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.076
Greetings.
- Greetings.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.274
First, let me say 'good evening'.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.236
First, I'm going to brief you.
Then I'll explain.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.036
I was coaching the kids today...

07:01.240 --> 07:05.153
...when a bunch of guys came and
said they'd bought the field.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.149
Our football field for all these years.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.199
The football field where...

07:11.360 --> 07:12.952
...we have been playing
all these years, since we were kids.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.198
An oasis in the middle
of all this concrete.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.993
Do you follow me?

07:18.440 --> 07:23.434
I immediately set off to see
the entrepreneur who'd bought it.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.989
I went there and talked to him.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.557
I offered him more than
he'd paid for it...

07:30.720 --> 07:33.792
...and got the lot back for
our neighborhood.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.640
- Good for you.
- You're a real man.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.275
But it came at a price.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.318
You wonder how much.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.068
300,000 lira. I'm screwed.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.913
That's a lot of money.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.836
That's why I'm in trouble.
I'm screwed.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.033
Actually we're all screwed.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.188
If I'm screwed, we're all screwed.
A real daisy chain.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.920
Am I the fall guy here?
If I'm screwed, so are you.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.513
It's that simple.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.954
I'll shut up now.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.190
And that's why now...

08:12.680 --> 08:15.478
...I'm asking you to empty
your pockets into the bag...

08:15.640 --> 08:18.632
...Nurullah is holding,
to help shoulder the expense.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.475
Oome on, let's see what you got.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.639
Look, a bottle cap.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.990
Someone threw in nail clippers.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.988
What a bunch of donkeys.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.113
Look at this. Someone put in
a cotton swab

08:36.280 --> 08:37.712
A used cotton swab.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.519
It's covered with yellow
ear wax.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.239
Look, smell it.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.868
Who would do that to the kids?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.594
We need money for the kids.
Put that aside.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.995
I'll send that to Mehmet at forensics
and find out who did it.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.037
I suspect it was Servet.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.715
But when I have it checked
and once we've got some DNA...

08:55.880 --> 08:58.110
...I'll get a sample from him.
Get it?

08:58.360 --> 09:00.794
But not with a swab from his ear.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.718
Add this...

09:03.480 --> 09:05.118
- 54.70.
- Add this.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.390
- 55.70.
- You can sell the lighter to the grocer.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.591
Finished. How much altogether?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.517
- 55.70.
- That's shameful.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.111
It's embarassing.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.989
Just 55.70 from
30-40 people?

09:17.280 --> 09:19.430
This won't do.
We won't get anywhere with them.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.830
We need to find some
guys with full pockets.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.275
Get it? Guys who
have cash in buckets.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.590
Get it? Big shots with rolls
of fat on their necks.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.553
They're the ones with money.
We'll milk them for it.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.593
We'll get them to donate.
That's how it works.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.349
Hello. Good day, sir.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.556
I'd like to speak to Rahmi Koç.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.591
Well, where is he?
Out?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.159
What do you mean by 'out'?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.635
If you tell me his exact location
I might be able to catch him.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.358
It's about a piece of land
and some money.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.312
We only need him to
give us a little.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.078
Then give me his son.
Give me Mustafa Koç.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.589
Where is he? Ah, playing golf.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.438
Then give me the other one.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.989
Give me Ali Koç.
The handsome one.

10:05.160 --> 10:09.278
At a match? He's forever
out playing football.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.358
Give me his little brother,
Kamil Koç.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.115
Kamil Koç isn't a family member?
Have you disowned him?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.079
What a shame an old family like
yours can't even share.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.958
He's out on the road every day,
this Kamil Koç.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.754
Hang up, then
Hang up.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.635
Get a load of that secretary.
You'd think her surname was Koç.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.119
'I' before 'e'...

10:27.400 --> 10:30.790
...except after 'c'.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.273
Receive, not recieve.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.999
Hello, Özge darling.
Is that you?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.275
You're not Özge Ulusoy?

10:39.480 --> 10:42.472
Don't try to tell me it's the wrong
number. This is your home phone.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.352
You're the same old Özge Ulusoy.
Please.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.994
Get us some of your dad's money.
Who's your dad?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.628
Isn't your dad Yilmaz Ulusoy?
What do you mean, no?

10:50.160 --> 10:52.549
Özge Ulusoy isn't from the
Ulusoy family?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.671
I'm not falling for that.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.876
You can't pull
that with me, Özge.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.230
OK then, Özge.
We can't see eye to eye.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.958
OK, Özge.
I don't need you.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.429
I don't need you.
Give me your big brother.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.272
Give me your big brother,
Çagatay Ulusoy.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.159
What do you mean, Çagatay Ulusoy
isn't your brother?

11:07.440 --> 11:10.193
What do you mean
you're not even related?

11:10.680 --> 11:15.231
Nearly all the rich and famous
share the same last names.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.873
Damn you.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.997
Damn you to hell.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.355
You're not what you seem.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.192
And your belly button's really high.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.039
Friends tell painful truths.
Your navel's almost in your mouth.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.072
This'll never work.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.709
We have to get to the mother Iode.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.513
An exception to the i before e rule.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.438
I know I remember one.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.359
But does the rule
apply to digraphs?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.189
What about 'science'?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.590
Hello. Good day.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.469
Is that Tübitak? Put a few businessmen
on the line, one after another.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.113
No, put them through to me,
not each other.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.430
There are no businessmen?
Well what have you got?

11:49.640 --> 11:52.393
Scientists?
Tübitak should have businessmen.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.552
Doesn't it stand for "The Leading
Businessmen of Turkey"?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.597
That's Tüsiad? Tüsiad?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.075
First time I heard of it.
I've never heard of Tüsiad.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.829
I know a few organizations:
UEFA, TJK, Turkish Language Board.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.470
Those are the ones I know.
Tüsiad's a mystery to me.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.193
Sorry about that.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.430
May God protect you
and help you think clearly.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.200
Eat lots of molasses and tahini.
It's good for the brain.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.916
Guys, I trust you but you've never
done anything useful.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.551
We haven't even managed to launch
a satellite in all these years.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.472
Where did we launch it?

12:22.720 --> 12:25.871
But from where? Wasn't it from
French Guiana?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.439
Be a little enterprising.
Be a little productive.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.989
OK, hang up. Out it short
and hang up.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.799
Hang up.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.868
That scientist over there
is giving me advice.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.712
Here I am working away and
what are you doing?

12:37.920 --> 12:39.353
You're playing games.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.273
I'm the only one here
working for the kids.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.635
Whoa...

12:48.240 --> 12:49.992
Slow down.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.873
I'll do something like this.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.953
Quick, take me to that cubicle.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.758
Quickly. Step on it.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.513
- Is this the purchasing department?
- Yes.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.319
Ah. Hello.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.470
I've got a deal for you.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.995
If I said I had a nice, live...

13:08.240 --> 13:11.391
...stone-free, well filtering,
nicely marbled with fat...

13:11.600 --> 13:14.717
...4- 5 kilo brand new kidney,
how much would you pay for it?

13:14.960 --> 13:18.032
- Kidney, sir?
- A human kidney. My own kidney.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.117
I'm sorry, sir.
There's been a misunderstanding.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.953
This is the purchasing department.
We buy medical equipment.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.712
- We don't buy kidneys and such.
- I see.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.709
- Spleens?
- For goodness sake.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.030
Get a spleen. It improves the blood.
It's medical equipment.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.629
Sir, this is a hospital not an abattoir.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.068
And I've got work to do.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.629
I'll give you my small intestine.
You can make chitlins.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.796
I have more than I can use.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.560
I eat, and out it goes.
Eat, and out it goes.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.598
Fix me up a direct exit.
I'll eat and shit all at once.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.796
Now you've gone too far.
I won't have that filth.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.678
It's time you left.
I'm busy.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.876
- You won't take my kidney?
- No sir, we won't.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.474
You won't take anything of mine?
- What of yours could I take?

13:53.640 --> 13:56.200
Now let me show you out.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.550
Sorry, my hand bumped it.
Sorry.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.632
- Be careful.
- Sorry, my hand bumped it.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.512
Sorry.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.232
- You're the branch manager?
- Yes, what is it?

14:20.400 --> 14:22.356
Ah, I was looking for you.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.234
- Yes?
- Hello.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.393
How can I help you?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.189
It's about a loan.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.948
What kind of loan?
A personal loan?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.235
Home or vehicle?

14:34.400 --> 14:37.392
A personal loan.
- Have you decided how much?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.959
- Yes.
- How much?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.388
300,000.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.392
- How much?
- 300,000 lira.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.676
Sir, we can't extend a loan that high.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.269
We usually approve amounts
between 5000 and 10,000.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.318
Ma'am, if all I needed was 5-10
thousand why would I come here?

14:50.520 --> 14:51.839
- This is a bank, isn't it?
- Yes.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.469
Well, I could collect 5-10 thousand
from my friends if I wanted to.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.551
What's your advantage in
being a bank?

14:56.720 --> 14:59.075
- But sir, like I said...
- Button it.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.993
- Sir...
- Button it.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.558
It's called a personal loan, right?
- Yes, a personal loan.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.274
Well I'm a person and
I need 300,000.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.839
We can't approve a sum that large.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.673
It's impossible for us to give you a
personal loan for that sun.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.912
It's a sum, not a sun.
First let's make that clear.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.317
The sun is what shines down on us
by the grace of God.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.034
Sum. I've got a way with words,
you see.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.350
- Alright.
- Look, I visited a bunch of banks...

15:23.680 --> 15:26.035
...and chose yours because it
seemed best.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.158
I'm not chosen; I choose.
I'll leave and go to a different bank.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.436
I'll walk out and go to
a different bank.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.757
OK, sir. Let me have your ID card
and I'll see what I can do.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.475
That's more like it.
Here's my ID.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.596
Sir, what's this?
- My identification.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.072
- Your what?
- Identification.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.113
- My ID.
- I can't proceed with this.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.318
It's not clear it's you.
You'll have to renew it.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.836
That's my ID. Give it here. Look.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.590
See? The same wild eyes.
The same round face...

15:56.800 --> 15:59.234
...and the same black unibrow.
Here.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.670
Sir, your card doesn't even
have an ID number.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.829
I can't process your application.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.639
Ma'am I've been a Turkish citizen
for 37 years.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.031
And I've never heard anything about
an ID number.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.038
I swear you're the first person
to bring it up.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.629
Sir, you need to renew your card.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.597
Otherwise we can't give you any loans.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.398
- Give me a mortgage.
- I'm sorry.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.198
- Give me a consumer loan.
- Sir, please.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.349
- Job training loan?
- No.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.909
- A farm cooperative loan.
- Sir, what are you talking about?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.469
I'll go into cotton and hazelnuts
with whatever's left over.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.359
Sir, please. I can't help you.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.988
Ma'am you sure are strict.
Outside work, it's another story.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.957
There's plenty of credit for everyone.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.752
I give up.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.229
I've got another proposal.
- What?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.478
Oome closer.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.796
Oome real close.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.039
Oome here.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.912
I checked there aren't any bugs.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.315
- I need 300,000.
- Yes?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.948
Arrange 350,000...

17:03.360 --> 17:05.510
...and I'll withdraw it...

17:05.760 --> 17:09.719
...and meet you in the parking lot
where I'll skim off 50,000...

17:09.920 --> 17:12.559
...and stick it in
the lining of your skirt

17:12.760 --> 17:15.319
What are you talking about?
- That's what I'll do.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.559
It'll be a win-win for us both.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.194
What are you saying?
I've had it with you.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.998
Why would I meet you in the parking lot?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.270
I'll save you from corporate slavery.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.591
Leave the room at once!
- What's wrong?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.557
You've offered me a bribe.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.910
- Not a bribe, a donation.
- What?

17:33.080 --> 17:35.833
I'll do it as a donation.
I'll even give you a receipt.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.991
You scratch my back...
Get it?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.668
Get out of here.
Leave here at once. Enough!

17:41.160 --> 17:43.116
You won't even nibble, will you?
- That's right.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.958
I showed you 100 different ways.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.475
You won't even let me get
to first base.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.472
Go or I'll call security.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.153
Where am I supposed to
find the money?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.912
That doesn't concern me.
Find it wherever.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.158
Should I steal?
Should I shoot someone?

17:56.840 --> 17:59.718
- Should I sell my body?
- I don't care. Do what you want.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.348
- My, oh my.
- Why are you getting on my nerves?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.393
Why won't you help me?

18:05.680 --> 18:08.956
Why won't you help me?
Is it so hard?

18:09.360 --> 18:12.033
I'm asking you, ma'am.
Is it so hard?

18:12.400 --> 18:15.631
As if I wanted it for myself.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.475
You'd think it was for me.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.153
If I want it for myself...

18:20.320 --> 18:23.995
...my wild animals gnaw me to death.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.030
May they gnaw at my heart

18:27.320 --> 18:30.312
May they spoon out my eyes.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.280
May they tear out my liver
And eat me alive...

18:33.480 --> 18:35.391
...if I want it for myself.
Shame on you.

18:35.560 --> 18:39.075
- I wanted it for the kids.
- Get out!

18:39.680 --> 18:43.468
So you lure me into your office
by promising me a loan.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.030
And then comes the sexual harassment.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.715
You tug down your stockings
with your foot, like this.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.316
And move on to the crotch area.
Tugging at it.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.199
- Pervert
- You disgraceful aphrodisiac.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.239
Disgraceful aphrodisiac.
With your nipples all hard.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.755
Shame on you.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.317
Primates enjoy warm water.

19:12.840 --> 19:17.391
They're making the most of their
friendship up in a tree.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.119
Oh, look at that.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.555
My how he loves the taste of snot.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.474
And enjoys eating it.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.550
Are you ready to live and compete...

19:31.800 --> 19:34.268
...on a tropical island?

19:34.560 --> 19:37.358
If you think you're fit and strong...

19:37.680 --> 19:39.238
...this desert island awaits you.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.597
Out of the competition will emerge
only one winner.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.838
And that person will go home
with 500,000 lira.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.037
'Desert Island' is beginning.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.117
Look, they said the grand prize
is 500,000.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.477
I'm not going to a deserted island.
That much I won't do.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.949
- Why won't you go the island?
- No, I'm not up to it.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.476
I don't want to. Don't push me.
I can't live in those conditions.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.393
In what conditions?
You live the same way here.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.755
Here you crap in kitty litter,
there you crap in sand.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.195
You live in a hut here,
you live in a hut there.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.079
I'm afraid of flying.
I can't go.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.470
You can take a pill and sleep
the whole way there.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.598
I can't sleep when someone is
sitting next to me.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.398
Someone could grope me
while I'm asleep.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.518
- You promised the neighborhood.
- I didn't make a promise like that.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.796
I said I'd buy the lot,
and somehow we will.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.349
But how? What could be a
better chance than this?

20:25.680 --> 20:27.398
How else will you find 500,000
all at once?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.470
No, I can't.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.915
Think of the kids.
You promised them.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.719
They'll lose their football field...

20:34.240 --> 20:36.800
You mentioned the kids.
That's my weak spot.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.350
You got right to my weak spot.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.715
You hit me where it hurts most.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.998
OK, I'll go.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.549
I'll go.
Let's apply.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.428
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

20:57.600 --> 21:00.319
Where do I apply for 'The Island'?

21:00.480 --> 21:03.597
Applications are online, sir.
And today was the last day.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.749
It's over. You're too late.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.275
What do you mean - too late?
There are all these people here.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.271
I want to apply, too.
Give me a form.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.509
It's over. Sorry.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.079
You've got one. Let me fill it out.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.639
Stop it! Orazy or what!

21:13.800 --> 21:15.074
What do you mean, over?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.231
It's not over until I say it is.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.470
It's not over until I say so.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.359
- Hello, The Island?
- Hello. The Island.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.153
I'm here for The Island too.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.032
You don't look the type for
The Island.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.270
What's that supposed to mean?
- You've got a potbelly.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.795
A bald head. A bushy beard.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.349
Your arteries are clogged with butter.
Your heart' s barely beating.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.919
Your liver's already dead.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.072
The sun would knock you out.
You won't get out alive. Go home.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.310
I've always been healthy.
Nothing's wrong with me.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.913
- Give me your form.
- Hey, what are you doing?

22:02.080 --> 22:03.593
Give me the form.
And give me that, too.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.512
Give me your points. Now go home.
- The competition?

22:05.680 --> 22:06.635
Go home!

22:09.600 --> 22:12.558
Look, there are auditions for
The X Factor right over there.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.912
A dog won last year. An orang-utan
has a good chance this year.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.229
Go get in line.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.072
Let's keep moving.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.993
Hello.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.876
Should I stand here,
On the red dot?

22:30.240 --> 22:31.389
Berke Göksu.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.750
That should be Recep Ivedik.
It's written wrong.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.673
What? You wrote your name wrong?
Didn't you fill it out yourself?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.274
No, I didn't. I had a bad hand
so I gave it to a friend.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.950
He wrote his name not mine
by mistake. The guy's a moron.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.958
That's not you in the photo.
You haven't got any hair in it.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.509
The photo's me.
It's a picture of me.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.079
I was like that 6 months ago.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.629
I had a hair transplant.
I had hair plug therapy.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.234
- Plugs all over my head.
- You added eyebrows too, I see.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.834
There's a different reason for that.
Erectile dysfunction pills.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.071
Hairiness is a side effect.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.276
Hairiness and madness.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.476
Here in the brows and
at the fork.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.312
- At the fork?
- Yeah, the ass crack.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.671
Where the cheeks meet.
It looks like a fork.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.797
OK, I got it. No more details.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.197
Tell us about yourself.
What kind of person is Recep?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.710
I'm aggressive. I have complexes.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.878
When I open up
I'm like a pussy cat.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.031
I give and give to those I love.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.509
But I take and take from those I hate.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.477
I'll exploit those I hate
right to the marrow.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.479
That's the way I am,
my nature.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.194
Do you think you can handle
the conditions on the island?

23:32.360 --> 23:36.512
I don't think they'll cause me trouble.
There's nothing special about them.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.917
On the island, we'll eat what we find.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.718
Right? Meals aren't served.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.791
It's the same in Istanbul.
I eat what I find.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.599
I don't think it'll be any different.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.911
As far as the toilet,
I think that on the island...

23:49.440 --> 23:51.954
...you crap in a ditch.
That's what they say.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.278
If that's the case, I've got a ditch
in my house in Istanbul.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.635
I crap into it the same way.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.872
That's the system. My toilet's been
broken for two years.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.998
I got a big plastic wash basin and
filled it with kitty litter, menthol.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.232
I crap into it. I've been popping in
kitty litter for 2 years.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.550
Do you really think you can
win The Island?

24:10.720 --> 24:12.233
If I don't win, I'm a liar and a cheat.

24:12.400 --> 24:16.109
- What will you do with the prize money?
- What's it to you, lady?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.396
Thank you.
You can expect a call.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.790
- When will you call?
- Within a few days.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.474
But which day?
Today, tomorrow, the next day?

24:23.640 --> 24:25.551
Am I expected to wait by the phone?

24:25.720 --> 24:28.314
Within a few days.
We need to evaluate the forms.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.119
There are other candidates. We'll call
when we're ready. OK?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.599
Off you go.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.637
Thank you.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.479
Off you go, thanks.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.876
We haven't shaken hands.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.472
That's right, dear neighbors.
Your brother is going off

24:42.760 --> 24:45.069
...to a faraway place,
to strange islands...

24:45.280 --> 24:48.078
...to represent you
What are you going to do?

24:48.240 --> 24:51.232
What is it your duty to do?
To support me.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.756
Remember to send your brother
lots of text messages...

24:54.960 --> 24:58.316
...especially on elimination nights.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.835
When I come back after a month...

25:01.080 --> 25:04.709
...I'll check your phone records
to see who sent messages.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.471
If I find out you haven't texted, I'll be
at you like the black angel of death.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.872
I'd never threaten.
I just... offer advice.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.037
I ask you, as a brother.

25:15.200 --> 25:19.113
But if you don't you'll regret
you were ever born.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.551
Text. OK, friends?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.314
With your support...

25:24.560 --> 25:28.030
...I'll come back from
that island a winner.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.590
Off you go, Recep.
Go in health.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.116
Win and come back safely.
- Thanks, brother.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.078
You'll be in charge around here
while I'm gone, right Toraman?

25:37.240 --> 25:39.276
Here, Recep. Enjoy it.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.676
What have you done?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.514
I wish you'd given me this earlier.
I'd have roasted it.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.638
Recep, my mom made this for you.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.233
I'll text all the time.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.960
Thanks, Rifat the Moron.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.192
- Thanks.
- Take this to remember us.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.238
And you'll coach the team,
Hayrettin.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.674
OK? Keep drilling.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.876
Teach the boys offside tactics.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.998
- OK.
- Alright. May God watch over you all.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.993
Goodbye, Recep.
Go and return like water.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.475
What are you doing, Mualla?
Just look at this car.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.596
I thought it was clean.
I didn't realize.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.274
What do you mean, Mualla?
You splashed dirty water on the car.

26:24.440 --> 26:28.115
Halit pees and craps in that bucket.
And you splash it on the car.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.149
How am I supposed to wash
the car at the last minute?

26:31.440 --> 26:34.512
The car's covered in filth.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.632
How could you.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.076
May God watch over you.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.159
Whoa!

27:27.760 --> 27:30.274
Welcome to The Island.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.909
Thank you.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.234
As you know, there are 2 teams
on 2 different islands...

27:38.480 --> 27:40.471
...wearing 2 different colors.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.029
You'll remember that last season...

27:43.280 --> 27:45.874
...we determined who would
be in which team...

27:46.120 --> 27:48.350
...before anyone came to the island.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.395
But this season the teams...

27:52.720 --> 27:55.518
...will be decided by drawing lots
held in just a moment.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.319
We've had a great selection process.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.711
Let me congratulate you all.
You'll make your own luck.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.791
- The drawing lots are a good idea.
- Thank you, Recep.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.520
Who would like to be team leader?

28:06.680 --> 28:10.309
I would.
I would, Irfan. I'm right here.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.350
The first team leader is Taylan.

28:13.520 --> 28:17.354
- And for the second time...
- Hey, I'm right over here.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.477
Recep. Since you insist...

28:19.760 --> 28:22.672
...we won't disappoint you on
day one. Everyone give him a hand.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.718
Welcome.

28:25.320 --> 28:29.154
I'll hand you a bandana...

28:29.440 --> 28:31.874
...that signifies your team colors.
Now if you're all ready...

28:32.040 --> 28:34.474
We're ready.
- OK.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.434
Taylan, you'll draw first.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.159
Simge.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.631
Simge in on the blue team, with Taylan.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.953
Nice draw. A perfect first draw.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.876
He got a real cutie. I hope
I do the same.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.680
By the grace of God.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.838
- Aslihan.
- That's me.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.077
Recep's adding Aslihan to his team.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.033
This isn't very nice.
This isn't good at all.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.033
Why? You drew Aslihan.
- She'll eat a lot.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.033
- Take a look at yourself.
- She'll be eating nonstop.

29:14.280 --> 29:18.193
We'll go over budget. Oonditions
are bad enough on the island.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.834
And we'll have to fill her up.
That's impossible.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.152
I'll toss this back and draw again.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.790
You can't do that.
Taylan is next. Right, Taylan.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.832
- Burak.
- Burak joins Taylan's team.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.469
He grabbed the good-Iooking guy.
See that?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.631
The kid's like a hyena.
He's two for two.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.313
He's two for two.
He's doing great.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.789
You're drawing next, Recep.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.430
Pray for me.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.919
Halil Ibo.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.390
Halil Ibrahim joins Recep's team

29:51.680 --> 29:53.238
This won't do at all.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.790
First I draw a cow,
then I draw a midget.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.952
Taylan, you're up. Go on.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.437
- Oenk.
- Oenk joins Taylan's team.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.876
He nabbed a guy again.
There's nobody left.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.634
No guys are left.
How could I be so unlucky.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.916
What kind of luck is this?
Two for two.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.197
How could things go so wrong?
God help me in my third draw.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.112
God help me.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.035
Let me mix it up good.
If I can just get that girl.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.629
- It's luck of the draw.
- I drew you.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.511
- Necati.
- Necati joins Recep's team.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.193
Look at the way he walks and runs.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.157
Knock-kneed,
like he shit in his pants.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.675
So far I've drawn a midget,
a fatty and a geriatric.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.308
How am I supposed to compete
with this? He'll kick the bucket.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.198
It's shameful to talk like that
in front of Necati.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.635
The sun will be beating down on him,
over 100 degrees.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.756
He'll turn beet red and keel over.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.399
We'll have to find a burial spot.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.915
Are we here to compete or
to stage a funeral?

30:49.080 --> 30:51.833
Oontinue please, Taylan.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.595
- Melis.
- Melis is on Taylan's team.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.638
He got another bombastic girl.
- It's your turn to draw.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.950
The name in the ball all comes
down to luck.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.315
It might be luck, but I
keep missing, Irfan.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.079
It's an Infantino
or an Irfan.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.037
You're making me miss, Irfan.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.036
How could I be?

31:10.200 --> 31:13.351
I think the balls vibrate. That's
What I think, Irfantino.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.795
Your names are even alike,
Irfan - Irfantino.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.030
There's cheating going on
with these balls.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.758
So, pick another ball.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.399
Will he get the teammate he wants?

31:21.560 --> 31:24.074
I'm taking one straight out this time.
No mixing.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.468
I've got my eye on that girl.

31:27.080 --> 31:27.990
- Gaye.
- That's me.

31:28.160 --> 31:32.358
Gaye is on Recep's team. Recep
gets another female teammate.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.872
- That's not a female.
- What?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.439
That's no girl, it's a boy.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.114
Are you sick or what?
Oan't you see I'm a girl.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.111
Look buddy, I got no
problem with you.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.952
Don't horn in everything.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.236
It's a guy. A guy named Gaye,
but a guy.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.232
- Have you checked?
- What do you mean?

31:47.400 --> 31:50.631
- Have you had a look?
- A look at what?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.757
She's got bollocks.
- What?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.388
- Bollocks.
- What's that?

31:55.960 --> 31:58.554
I can't tell you right now.
We're on the air.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.632
Let's continue. Taylan, there are
hardly any balls left.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.950
We're down to the last four.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.872
Let's see who Taylan adds to his team.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.157
- Deniz.
- Deniz is on Taylan's team.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.473
Irfan, just give us her.
You can have this one.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.030
All I ask is for her.
And take this away.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.270
Make herjoin us.
- You're one down right now.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.237
Pick another ball, Recep.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.597
I'm going get that girl.
I've got my eye on her.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.872
If I get her, we'll have four guys
and two girls on the team.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.951
Damn you, Serkan.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.908
Serkan joins Recep's team.
- I won't go along with this.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.071
This last blow really hurt

32:37.240 --> 32:39.276
I won't accept it.
I'm drawing again.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.318
I can't compete like this.
It's not possible.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.953
Look at that team,
and look at this one.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.872
If they're human, what are they?

32:46.040 --> 32:48.838
It's a team straight out of
Noah's ark.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.195
This is like the Darica Zoo.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.476
They're God's blessings,
and they're God's wrath.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.074
This won't do. You made up
this lottery thing.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.834
Damn whoever came up with
the idea of lottery.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.878
OK, we're down to the last two balls
and the last two players.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.873
Taylan, you'll be choosing
your final teammate.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.476
Let's see...

33:06.720 --> 33:08.711
I'll pick the other one.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.631
- Eda!
- Eda is on Taylan's team.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.388
I knew it,
I just knew it!

33:16.560 --> 33:18.357
I saw it, I knew what he was up to.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.796
He threw the ball back.
He should get the other one.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.757
I picked all those balls
just to get that girl.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.480
Shake it and pull out a ball.
I kept drawing to get her.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.234
But he took a ball and looked at it.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.278
When he saw that idiot in the ball,
he threw it back.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.032
I didn't open the ball, I said.
Didn't you see?

33:34.200 --> 33:36.760
How can you put it back without opening
it? You've got to open it.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.911
Didn't you pick this one first?
- For goodness sake.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.195
Take him. You picked him.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.237
I put it back without opening it.
- Let's drop it.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.913
Now's not the time.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.038
So it's either by hook
or by crook, right?

33:47.480 --> 33:49.596
Right, the last ball
- Open it. I don't want to see it.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.398
Ok, but there's only one
contestant left.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.551
We don't want him.
Send him back to Turkey.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.517
- Go home.
- Recep, we've got to have the same...

33:55.760 --> 33:58.638
...number of players on each team.
- Damn it all.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.796
Just send us to our island.
Leave us with our fate.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.076
We're sending Taylan's team...

34:05.280 --> 34:07.794
...to the blue island and
Recep's team to the red island.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.359
Get going.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.351
Get going.

34:23.719 --> 34:25.949
Gather round.
Form a line.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.112
I've got a welcome speech for you.
Gather round.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.273
Right. First, welcome to
this lovely island.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.670
Now let's get one thing clear.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.393
I'm the king of the island.
We need to agree on that.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.597
Now, that doesn't mean
I decide everything...

34:41.840 --> 34:43.478
...and get what I want...
Never.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.313
I believe in freedom of thought.

34:46.480 --> 34:50.109
I support democracy. Everyone
is free to think what they want.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.117
We have freedom of thought
and democracy.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.998
You can say what you want.
I'll listen to it all...

34:55.159 --> 34:58.277
...pass it through my filter,
and make the final decision.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.715
What I say, goes. It's that simple.
There's only one administrator.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.235
I can't run this place if you
all do what you want.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.039
There's one ruler. It's that simple.
Does anyone have any objections?

35:06.200 --> 35:08.236
- What a bunch of nonsense.
- Hey! Braveheart

35:08.400 --> 35:11.119
Quiet. Don't be so jumpy?
Anyone else?

35:12.280 --> 35:13.349
No, everything's fine.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.795
We'll move on to number two.
Oome here.

35:17.160 --> 35:21.836
This pocket-size Hercules will be
my right hand man.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.879
If you abuse, mistreat or betray
him in any way...

35:25.120 --> 35:27.509
...you'll have done the same to me.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.477
And I'll come after you.
Understood?

35:29.640 --> 35:30.755
Understood.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.390
Ah, next. Geriatric, you, fatso,
you and you, Braveheart...

35:34.600 --> 35:38.388
...fan out across the island. Find all
the fruit and coconut you can...

35:38.640 --> 35:41.757
...taste it and bring it back here
if it's edible.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.239
OK, we'll handle it.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.434
You two, go deep into the jungle.
Gather all the...

35:46.680 --> 35:50.753
...bamboo, wood and grass
you can find and bring it here.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.911
Oonstruction materials. See?
- OK.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.594
You and I will do the building.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.718
What is the first thing to be done
on a deserted island...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.558
...since the first Turkish tribe?

36:01.280 --> 36:02.599
What's wrong with you guys?

36:02.880 --> 36:05.348
I'm here with an army of morons.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.080
Shame on you.
Shelter.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.749
Build a shelter.
We're going to build a shelter.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.832
OK, scatter.
Motion, synergy. Oome on, energy.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.314
Oome here.
Oome here.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.630
- Yes.
- You think I'm carrying my bag?

36:17.880 --> 36:21.350
Why do I have you?
What have an assistant?

37:06.960 --> 37:08.598
Lift it, lift it.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.398
To the left, shift it to the left.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.874
Whoa, that's it.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.752
Ok, let's see.
Secure it. Go over there.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.831
Secure it. That's it.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.313
Brother, it's amazing.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.675
I used Mimar Sinan's
dome technique.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.876
The hot air goes up and it
stays cool below.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.917
Wow, it's real showy.
- Thanks, dude.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.469
Yes, it's a beauty. Good job.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.551
It's amazing, brother.
- Thanks.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.393
That's all we've got, guys.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.915
We've got as much as we don't have.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.431
You, pair of idiots. Night's coming.
Get a fire ready.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.079
I'll come and check, OK?

37:39.240 --> 37:41.674
You, go count the coconuts.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.195
Tell me how many there are.
Understood?

37:44.360 --> 37:47.397
Record them in the inventory. You're
In charge of the Treasury. Run.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.352
You, drop everything you're holding.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.193
I'll explain the sleeping arrangements.
Oome closer.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.597
Right. We need a certain
sleeping arrangement.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.593
Why? To protect against
outside threats.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.272
While we're sound asleep
and defenseless...

38:03.600 --> 38:06.512
...the fleas nipping at our butts,
the outside enemy is wide awake.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.268
There might be a treacherous
attack on us.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.078
That's why the sleeping arrangement
is so important.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.236
I made a big doorway on purpose.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.868
Why? Because that's where
Aslihan is going to sleep.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.871
- Why me?
- You're nice and wide.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.031
- Just take a look at yourself.
- OK, mine's wide too...

38:20.320 --> 38:22.231
...but I'm the brain team.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.039
You will sleep in the doorway.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.714
If a psycho starts hanging
out here, you'll be first.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.434
First, your belly will make him stop.
You see?

38:29.600 --> 38:34.196
Wolf, jackal, cheetah. If an animal
sees you it'll pause first.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.352
Oh no, there's something bigger
and wilder than me.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.915
- More of an animal.
- That's it.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.593
But you are.
The animal will be scared.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.716
If I were a wolf I'd be scared.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.952
Let's say it doesn't run away.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.076
It would start eating your boobs first.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.832
It would rip out your intestines.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.036
So who's the second person
we sacrifice?

38:52.200 --> 38:53.553
- Who?
- Necati.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.239
Why me?
You're always playing with me.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.038
Of course I am?
Who better than you.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.430
Your foot's in the grave as it is.
You'll sleep here.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.513
You'll be second in the
line of defense.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.233
That's what war is.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.956
You send the easy pickings
up to the front lines.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.878
You, dude.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.390
You'll watch out for any danger
creeping up from behind.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.788
- Oh really
- Yes, really.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.075
You'll sleep there, in the very back.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.596
I'm thinking of having the two
idiots sleep crosswise.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.514
Understand? Me and Ibo
will sleep right in the middle.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.193
Oause we're the brain team.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.199
What did Mustafa Kemal Atatürk do?
He declared Ankara the capital.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.352
Why? Oause it's right in the middle.
We're sleeping in the middle.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.556
Brother, I counted.
There are 45 coconuts.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.400
What do you mean, 45?
I counted 53 coconuts.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.949
Go count again, you moron.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.276
I always double check.
Why?

39:41.440 --> 39:44.000
A good commander always does.
Never trust even your right hand man.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.070
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.515
Keep your eyes peeled.
Be sharp and agile.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.319
OK get to it.
Take off your shoes.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.477
Take off your shoes!
Off go the shoes.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.475
- OK we took them off.
- Of course you did.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.470
Let me put this here.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.478
- What's wrong with him?
- Who does he think he is?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.200
Do this, do that.
This way, not that way.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.555
Sleep, rise, eat this, not that.
- What a maniac.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.631
He's a bandit.
Let's send him off the island.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.315
I didn't catch that!
Are you talking behind my back?

40:15.560 --> 40:19.519
I can hear everything.
I've got ears everywhere.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.592
What kind of dance is that?

40:32.840 --> 40:36.355
Idiots. Didn't I tell you to make
a fire? You are dancing here!

40:36.520 --> 40:39.592
We're making the fire of Anatolia.
- We tried but we couldn't light it.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.069
What do you mean? It's getting dark.
You can't even light a fire...

40:42.240 --> 40:43.798
Idiot. Move away.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.312
I'll have to do this too.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.471
I built the house,
I found the food.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.232
I'll light the fire, too.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.030
Stick the xxx right in.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.599
Rub it like this.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.069
When there's a spark I'll show
you the quick way to get it going.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.708
When you see a spark, say,
"A spark." OK?

40:59.920 --> 41:01.353
- OK.
- "A spark."

41:01.520 --> 41:02.714
Get to it.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.952
Tell me when there's a spark.
- OK.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.157
There's a spark.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.154
It flared up good.
Make it burn good.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.710
Don't expect to come over here and
fart all the time. I'm only human, too.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.791
You really got it going.
Sure I did.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.076
Learn how and you can do it yourselves.

41:19.240 --> 41:22.277
Make the flames burn higher.
Don'tjust stare at it.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.072
This is getting to me.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.630
I don't like my spot.
I really don't like it.

41:45.280 --> 41:47.714
I hate where I'm sleeping.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.558
Shhh.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.559
Are you awake?

41:53.040 --> 41:55.190
Move over you idiot.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.674
Move over.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.038
You're right next to me,
and it's hot as it is.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.630
What's this all about.
What are you doing?

42:16.560 --> 42:19.870
Look, he's squeezing my tit.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.990
I'm going to break his hand.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.710
Sleep the right way.
Hey. Sleep the right way.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.798
Oh my god.
Oh boy.

42:36.120 --> 42:39.112
You're so shameless. I'm here sleeping
and you're pressing up against me.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.157
You're so rude! Act your age.
Pervert

42:41.320 --> 42:43.072
- Why would I press against you?
- That's what you're doing.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.719
And you're humping me, too.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.677
- What's going on?
- He's humping me.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.592
- He's pressing up on me.
- We're trying to sleep here.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.591
Sleep another time. They're pressing
up against us, I tell you...

42:50.760 --> 42:53.115
...and you say you're sleeping.
Get up Halil Ibo, we're going.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.430
I can't sleep with these pervs.
Get up, we're going.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.030
Perv! Damn you.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.277
Perv!
- Oan you believe it?

43:00.440 --> 43:03.159
You think someone my age is
going to put up with that, Ibo?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.788
I came here, honorable and pure.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.794
How could this happen?
Stretch out here, OK.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.677
- Have a peaceful sleep.
- Thanks, brother. You too.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.319
Now, I've turned my back on you.

43:20.760 --> 43:23.228
I don't want any funny business, Halil Ibo.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.550
You can trust me, brother.

43:28.600 --> 43:29.749
Recep.

43:30.160 --> 43:31.149
Recep?

43:31.520 --> 43:33.238
- Don't move.
- What is it?

43:33.440 --> 43:35.351
There's a crab.
Don't move.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.069
- A crab, where?
- On your face.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.992
Where?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.756
Ah, a crab!
- Brother.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.594
- Let me get it.
- Ah, a crab!

43:53.320 --> 43:54.799
Welcome, friends.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.031
We've gathered here for
our challenge.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.714
This is your first challenge
on The Island.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.076
We've prepared a package
for the winning team.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.515
I contains a large supply of...

44:04.720 --> 44:08.190
...all kinds of food.
From tea to sugar...

44:08.440 --> 44:11.352
...and from rice to pasta.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.155
And that's not all.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.353
We've also included an assortment
of tools to make your tasks and

44:17.560 --> 44:19.755
...life on the island easier.

44:20.040 --> 44:23.271
First I want to turn to the team leaders...

44:23.480 --> 44:25.311
...before we start
What will they say...

44:25.480 --> 44:27.311
...about the island and the game?

44:27.480 --> 44:28.549
Taylan, let's start with you.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.438
Irfan Bey, we've slept well
and feel rested.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.158
We're full of energy now.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.594
We've formed friendships.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.352
Let me send my condolences
to the red team.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.193
They haven't got a chance.
We'll wipe them out.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.510
Who are saying you'll wipe out?
I'll break your nose.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.079
- But Irfan Bey...
- Just a moment.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.708
Just a moment.
We don't allow that here.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.560
Please, I'm asking you.
Please refrain from...

44:47.880 --> 44:49.711
The team leaders look ready to me.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.997
A round of applause as Taylan and Recep
step up to the hammers.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.230
- Ready, Recep?
- Irfan, I have a question.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.356
- Yes, Recep?
- Oan I throw two hammers at once?

45:01.520 --> 45:03.033
Like the Turkish warriors of old.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.475
There's no reason you can't
if you want to.

45:05.640 --> 45:08.712
Thanks. I'll try it that way.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.238
OK, here we go.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.475
Yes! That's how it's done.
That's it. That's how you do it.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.358
What happened?
Your mouth's hanging open.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.670
All that boasting of yours.
Now what happened?

45:24.840 --> 45:26.273
Throw it.
Now it's your turn.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.953
Let's watch you do it.

45:30.560 --> 45:33.074
Irfan, he's spoiling my
concentration.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.629
Please don't distract each other.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.518
I cleared my sinuses, that's all.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.192
Is that a bird?

45:42.800 --> 45:45.712
What happened? Did you miss?
What happened?

45:46.000 --> 45:46.989
Look closely...

45:47.240 --> 45:50.630
I don't even have to look.
I can aim while I talk to you.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.715
Yes! That's the way!

45:54.200 --> 45:55.599
That'll show you.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.433
High five, high five.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.069
Red team 1, blue team zero.

46:00.320 --> 46:02.276
Now for the second contestants.

46:02.440 --> 46:05.079
Halil Ibrahim and Deniz.

46:05.480 --> 46:07.232
Oome on. Show them how it's done.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.438
What kind of throw was that?

46:10.240 --> 46:12.629
Deniz hit it!

46:17.280 --> 46:18.952
Ah-choo!

46:19.760 --> 46:21.159
I swear, I'm catching a cold.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.878
Oome on, throw it.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.352
That's it! That's it!

46:27.520 --> 46:29.795
Red team!

46:32.760 --> 46:34.910
- Gaye missed.
- Is that any way to throw?

46:35.120 --> 46:36.917
What kind of throw was that?

46:38.040 --> 46:41.874
- Eda hits it again.
- She throws like an Amazon.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.718
Hit it like a man.
It's right in front of you.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.469
Eda hits it. Red team 2,
blue team 1.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.996
Nice bikini.
The top's nice, too.

46:53.240 --> 46:56.038
We're at a critical point.
The teams are tied 7-7.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.959
The winner of this challenge
takes home the prize.

46:59.120 --> 47:02.157
A round of applause as Aslihan and
Simge take their places.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.993
Excuse me Irfan. I'd like to
say something.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.435
- Go ahead.
- Our teammate Aslihan...

47:07.640 --> 47:10.279
...hurt her shoulder.
I'll compete in her place.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.591
- Aslihan, are you injured?
- Not at all. I'm just fine.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.876
- I can compete.
- Hey, your injured.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.758
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

47:18.120 --> 47:20.714
You're saying you're not injured?
That your shoulder is fine?

47:20.880 --> 47:23.269
She's badly injured.
Her shoulderjoints are worn out.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.476
What are trying to?
I'm not injured.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.232
You were born crippled.
Get a load of this, would you?

47:27.400 --> 47:29.311
She's a cripple from birth.
She's an Angus cow.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.277
Her mother didn't bear her.
Her mother imported her.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.159
She's a tick away from morbid obesity.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.709
She's an Angus, obese, morbidly obese.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.520
She's right on the edge.
She's not healthy enough to play.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.119
Oh, and you're thin as a rake!

47:41.400 --> 47:44.153
Recep, we're talking about a lady.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.590
Ohoose your words more carefully.

47:46.760 --> 47:48.830
You have a bad shoulder, right?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.718
- Your shoulder's injured, right?
- What are you doing?

47:50.880 --> 47:53.075
- Aren't you injured?
- No, I'm not. I'm going to play.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.639
Then go ahead and play.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.075
Let's hear it for Aslihan and Simge
as they take their places.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.639
I'll ask for a reckoning.

48:00.120 --> 48:02.031
- Aslihan hits it.
- Good for you.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.509
Who'd have thought it.
Bravo.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.076
- Simge misses.
- Off you go, babe.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.232
Oome on, Aslihan.
Let's see you throw.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.436
Aslihan throws
is two for two.

48:13.600 --> 48:17.149
Good for you. I'm a slave to
that belly of yours.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.790
I'm a slave to your sweaty boobies.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.349
Let me kiss those boobies.
- I've had it.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.839
Really, good job.

48:26.480 --> 48:27.674
Simge misses again.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.592
Hit it and you'll get a special prize
from me tonight.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.830
- Just shut up.
- Lf we get the prize, I'll give you a prize.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.911
Shut up.
- OK.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.595
- Aslihan misses.
- Damn it. Idiot.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.876
- Why can't you throw right?
- Shut up.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.917
Your arm's so meaty you can't even
lift it, of course.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.559
Stop talking.
I can't concentrate.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.472
Screw you and your concentration.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.638
Hippo!

48:47.400 --> 48:49.675
- Simge hit it!
- Now that's a woman.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.474
Wearing her bandana,
Oalamity Jane.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.591
Angus, it's 2-1.
Throw it and end this.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.274
- Shut up.
- OK, I'll talk real nice, cutie.

48:57.520 --> 49:01.399
I'll talk sweet to you,
honey lips.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.113
Shut your mouth.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.636
- Aslihan missed.
- God damn it.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.234
Throw straight. The tile's right there.
Why can't you break it?

49:08.400 --> 49:10.311
- You brown cow.
- Just shut up.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.869
I talked straight, nothing.
I showed affection, nothing.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.679
Should I talk rough?
Should I roar like a beast?

49:17.760 --> 49:19.716
- Simge hit it!
- No way, man.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.030
- Tie score.
- This can't be happening.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.634
Whoever hits it, wins.
- You're a lady like a destroyer.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.155
Oome on, you're like a tank.
- Shut up!

49:27.320 --> 49:30.517
Oome on.
Nobody can stop you. Hit it.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.800
- Aslihan missed!
- Damn you. How could you.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.315
One after another. Why can't you
hit it, you fool?

49:36.600 --> 49:38.079
When it's right in front of you?
What happened?

49:38.240 --> 49:41.038
Is your hair tie too tight? Is it
cutting off the blood to your brain?

49:41.280 --> 49:45.319
If Simge hits it, the blue team wins.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.634
Simge throws it!

49:47.800 --> 49:49.836
Damn it!
This is terrible.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.753
This is just awful.
How could this happen?

49:53.000 --> 49:53.955
The blue team takes the prize.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.076
Get away from me.
I'm upset.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.357
We'll go hungry cause of you.
- The Blue Team!

49:59.680 --> 50:01.272
Get out of here!
This is terrible.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.072
It's just the worst.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.754
How many days have we been
gnawing on coconuts.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.515
We're turning into coconuts.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.918
And they're not filling.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.231
Should I go have a look
in the jungle?

50:19.400 --> 50:20.549
I might find something else.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.711
We looked everywhere.
There's nothing else there.

50:22.880 --> 50:26.759
How do you know!
Have you studied geography?

50:27.080 --> 50:28.559
I didn't mean anything.
Why are you mad?

50:28.720 --> 50:32.395
Hunger's getting on my nerves.
Don't make me even worse.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.028
- Sorry.
- Button it.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.111
- Pardon me.
- Button it.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.557
Let's go walk through the jungle.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.434
We have to find something else
than coconuts.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.198
I'm fed up with coconuts all the time.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.669
I'm fed up and famished.
I'm going to pass out on the spot.

50:56.840 --> 50:59.274
We shouldn't eat things
we don't know about.

50:59.560 --> 51:01.118
What could we not know?

51:01.280 --> 51:03.032
It's your typical jungle.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.237
Nature shares her bounty
here in the jungle.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.632
Let's have a look round.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.149
Ah! What's this?

51:17.320 --> 51:18.753
It looks like cucumbers but...

51:19.000 --> 51:21.116
It's your typical tropical cuke.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.872
A tropical cucumber.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.951
What would cukes be doing
on a tropical island?

51:25.120 --> 51:28.396
Oukes grow everywhere, idiot.
They just need watery soil.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.951
Here, eat it. A farmer's cuke

51:31.120 --> 51:32.951
- I'm not eating it.
- Take it. It's from your brother.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.629
- I'm not eating anything I don't know.
- Son, it's from your big brother.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.553
It could be poisonous.
You shouldn't eat it either.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.873
I wish you hadn't.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.236
Oh, it was juicy. It was great.
Have one.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.311
No thanks, not for me.
- Have a bite.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.869
I didn't like the way it smelled.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.474
I'm telling you to eat it!

51:54.720 --> 51:56.278
- Go on.
- I don't want to refuse you...

51:56.520 --> 51:58.988
...but I really can't.
- Well don't then.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.713
Get the machete.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.269
I can't believe you didn't have any.

52:04.440 --> 52:07.512
I don't want any.
Insisting won't change that.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.555
Are you OK?

52:12.960 --> 52:14.473
The Earth moved.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.036
I told you not eat those cukes.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.191
You've been poisoned.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.117
It's really bright, isn't it?

52:23.280 --> 52:25.669
It's dazzling.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.838
Oome and sit down.
- Oome on.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.514
I feel terrible.
Get me some water.

52:33.760 --> 52:36.433
I'll be right back.

52:38.600 --> 52:41.160
When did the sky turn pink?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.911
And the sea is purple.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.232
The trees are moving in on me.

52:47.600 --> 52:50.478
The trees are moving in.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.399
I could skip to the other side.

52:54.760 --> 52:56.079
Is that a gorilla?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.319
Is that a rotisserie chicken?

52:58.600 --> 53:00.238
And it's steaming.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.952
I've going to take a bite of thigh.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.590
What are you doing?
- Help.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.348
Let me go!

53:18.360 --> 53:20.032
Leave me alone!

53:20.320 --> 53:23.198
My foot! He's eating my foot!

53:31.720 --> 53:32.994
Welcome.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.309
- Hello.
- Thank you.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.118
We're here for an elimination challenge.

53:36.520 --> 53:40.638
Someone from today's losing team
will say goodbye...

53:40.960 --> 53:44.270
...to the dream of winning 500,000...

53:44.520 --> 53:45.919
...and will leave the island.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.556
This is a critical challenge.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.917
I'd like the first contestants
to take a step forward.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.398
Are you ready?

54:00.600 --> 54:02.750
Oome on, boy! Oome on!

54:03.560 --> 54:06.358
Oome on.
Oome on, guys.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.075
Run, run, run!

54:18.240 --> 54:21.152
The red team is ahead
and got the first ball.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.078
Recep and Halil Ibrahim are up.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.435
The competition is fierce.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.833
Halil Ibrahim has fallen.
- Why'd you fall overboard?

54:33.120 --> 54:35.554
- Damn you.
- I didn't mean to.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.153
You're splashing around.
Swim over here.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.117
- I don't know how.
- God damn you.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.589
The blue team is coming.
They're almost finished.

54:41.760 --> 54:45.070
I don't believe it. The one person
I had faith in.

54:45.960 --> 54:48.190
- They're finished.
- The blue team won.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.191
- We just watched them finish.
- Brother.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.875
What's that? It's a shark!
Help me.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.871
What's that?
- Please help me.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.879
- A shark!
- Help me!

54:59.080 --> 55:01.913
Be careful!
Please...

55:11.040 --> 55:14.555
- Get away.
- Help me.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.079
What are you doing?
Be careful.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.992
- Get away.
- I'm swimming away.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.832
Be careful.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.510
Oome here, right to me.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.877
Good evening.
- Good evening.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.352
This is the first elimination
round on The Island.

56:18.680 --> 56:22.389
We'll be sending home a contestant
from the red team.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.598
We were all terrified by
the canoe competition...

56:25.760 --> 56:30.754
...that took place earlier today.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.833
Let's have a round of applause for
Recep, who escaped unhurt...

56:34.000 --> 56:37.356
...and is sitting among us now.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.750
Thank you.
Don't clap. Thank you.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.115
And now comes the excitement
of the elimination round.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.836
The two contestants with the most
text messages will be granted immunity.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.675
It is our viewers who will decide which
contestants are immune.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.997
Our contestants will take turns
writing the name of the person...

56:53.200 --> 56:55.668
...they vote off the island.
Recep is first.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.956
OK, Necati.

57:10.600 --> 57:15.879
I respect your age and considered
you to be an older brother on the team.

57:16.080 --> 57:19.231
We had good times and bad.
We shared a lot.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.112
Until that black day.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.359
When in the middle of the night,
while I was completely helpless...

57:25.640 --> 57:28.518
...you latched onto me from behind,
and humped me...

57:28.880 --> 57:31.440
...proving what a pervert you are.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.717
May God damn you.
Get lost and leave the island.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.269
I don't want to see you here anymore,
you sick man.

57:37.440 --> 57:40.000
Get off the island.
You were useless anyway.

57:40.240 --> 57:42.800
You're old and you're disgusting.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.354
Now get lost.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.677
Halil Ibrahim.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.473
Let's see which two contestants
get the most text messages.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.478
Who? Who are they?

58:15.280 --> 58:16.599
Recep.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.399
Another Recep.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.949
Damn it. How shameful.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.513
Necati.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.559
Someone jokingly wrote 'pervert'.

58:29.720 --> 58:31.073
It's not a joke, it's a note.

58:31.720 --> 58:34.473
Another Necati. 2-2.

58:35.800 --> 58:36.915
Recep.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.634
Damn it.
Did you write that?

58:40.040 --> 58:41.837
Why all the long faces?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.070
A great big Recep.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.356
Shame on you, Aslihan.

58:47.680 --> 58:50.353
- Another Recep.
- Shame on you all.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.632
It's crime, it's a sin.
Stabbing me in the back.

58:54.200 --> 58:56.191
Tell me to my face
if you have a problem.

58:56.360 --> 58:59.511
You'll see, I'll still be here
and in your face.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.672
We now know the contestant
to be voted on in the text messages.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.593
The voting by text message
is now open.

59:05.760 --> 59:09.309
After a short break we'll be back...

59:09.640 --> 59:12.791
...and learn who was eliminated.

59:13.640 --> 59:14.993
Did I make it?

59:16.280 --> 59:18.316
Irfan. Did I make it?
- Pardon?

59:21.560 --> 59:23.391
- Who won?
- Won what?

59:23.680 --> 59:24.829
The text voting.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.951
The voting's just begun, Recep.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.190
I know that, but who won?

59:29.480 --> 59:31.391
I won't know until the results
are notary authorized, Recep.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.233
What's all this about a notary?

59:34.400 --> 59:36.356
Oome one.
You can't do that to me.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.631
- Do that?
- Who's the notary, Nihat Beyan?

59:38.800 --> 59:39.949
- No.
- Who is it?

59:40.240 --> 59:41.958
- Our own notary.
- You've been saying that for years.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.317
Notar this, notar that. You'll say
there's a notar when I'm up there.

59:45.600 --> 59:47.158
Tell me who won.
You know the results.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.231
We're live, the commercials are ending.
- Who won?

59:49.400 --> 59:51.197
- I don't know. Sit down.
- Oh, come on.

59:51.360 --> 59:53.191
I swear I don't know.
We're about to go live...

59:53.360 --> 59:56.397
- I'm so excited.
- Me, too.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.073
Irfan, do you know?

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.674
We're now back after
a short commercial break.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.673
And the moment has arrived.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.959
Thank you.
A big thanks to you all.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.032
It's time to announce
who will be the first person...

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.637
...to leave the island this year.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.110
Irfan, can I say something?
- Of course, Recep.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.793
I've got something to say.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.998
I have a name for those who smile
to my face and plot behind my back.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.635
It's slimy and dishonest.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.789
It's dishonorable.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.474
Recep, let me remind you
that we're on the air.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.999
I'm choosing my words carefully
because we're live.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.152
It's slimy and dishonest.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.396
It's being a dirty dog.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.518
- That's going too far.
- The message was received.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.876
Received by registered post.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.349
Registered and prepaid.
By all of you.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.953
Right then.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.838
If Necati has something to say...

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.877
- Oan I add something?
- Go on.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.510
I know our esteemed public

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.792
...always sides with the underdog.
I've been wronged.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.952
The public stands with the wronged.
Long live our people.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.953
OK. That's quite a slogan.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.995
So, I now open the envelope.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.593
Hurry up and open it.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.232
What does it say?

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.159
Who? Who is it? Tell us.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.917
This evening, leaving The Island
and the dream of winning the...

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.835
...500,000 lira prize, is the contestant...
- Who is it?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.878
...whose name I now announce.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.596
- The person leaving The Island...
- Who is it?

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.228
...is unfortunately...

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.549
Who is it?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.798
- Necati.
- That's it. Yes!

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.474
Right on. The public
made the right choice.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.471
The public did it again.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.710
The people have spoken
the truth once again.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.192
Get going. Get lost.
Take your torch and go.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.233
We can heave a sigh of relief.
- Oongratulations to Recep.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.719
Thanks. God bless you.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.552
Our condolences to Necati.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.508
Not from me. He can piss off.
He can go straight to hell.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.469
Necati, say farewell to your friends.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.709
Oome here.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.554
Necati is leaving the island
with his torch.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.755
I pocketed his glasses.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.957
Our first elimination night has ended.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.715
I wish you success until the next one.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.113
And I send the red and blue teams
back to their islands.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.712
Look at them.
Like lamb fish.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.076
I'm king of the ocean,
and of the seas.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.231
And king of the land
King of all realms.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.835
Good for you, brother.
You caught some big fish.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.672
I sure did. They'd come in at
10-12 kilos.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.796
- Oh, you caught fish?
- Yes, I did.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.837
You really went for it.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.317
At the sight of two fish you've
started sucking up to me.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.200
But you were fine with writing my
name last night? No fish for you!

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.670
As if we need your fish.
I hope they're poisonous.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.398
Don't curse me with that big
body of yours.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.438
Just look at them.
They've got to be poisonous.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.115
No, the more colorful the fish,
the more delicious.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.958
What's with all the envy?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.309
With all the calculations?

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.517
Fine, do what you want.
Bon appétit.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.194
It'll be delicious of course.
Now get lost.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.873
Fine then. We're going.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.435
It's normal for Aslihan to say it...

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.393
...but if Gaye says they're poisonous.
They really might be.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.518
If you don't trust me
you can piss off too.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.592
How can you say that?
- Like this: You can piss off.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.715
You misunderstood me.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.155
I teach you to fish and
look at what you say.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.034
I know fish, sonny.
I'm not some know-nothing.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.998
My name's Recep Ivedik, got it?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.353
First you prod the fish like this, OK?

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.717
You check its face, its eyes.
Are the eyes full of life?

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.349
Are the eyes cloudy?

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.713
You see? My finger goes right in
that's how fresh it is.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.514
You slap it in the face. Look.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.990
Then you put it on the table.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.436
You study the fish. You massage
its belly. You see?

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.352
Then we slit its belly.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.955
You slit it like this.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.071
You open up its belly.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.790
Your hand goes right inside.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.996
Look, like this.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.674
I swim in the sea,
I'm a free fish.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.155
I swim in the sea,
I'm a free fish

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.993
It says, as it gets speared in the head.
You follow me?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.718
Like this. Done.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.309
Let's clean it now.
Look, look.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.708
Look at those scales.
- Huh?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.313
- Look how the scales fell off.
- Right.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.517
You could toss a handful at your
sweetheart, like rose petals. Right?

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.591
- Would it do any good?
- Of course it would. Why not?

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.672
She'd fall madly in love.
Women love beastly men.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.911
Never forget that.
We've gone from fish to this.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.390
The hairier a man's body the more
irresistible he is to women.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.279
Got it? Women get all dolled up.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.834
Puff up like a turkey.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.797
Men put on their own show.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.757
Look at my body, look at my body.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.309
Look at it, look at it.
Do you understand?

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.153
You know those matadors in Spain?

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.631
Go there and you'll see all the ladies
chasing after the matadors.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.870
You sure will. They're all trying
to sleep with a matador.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.678
I saw it myself.
That's how it works.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.870
- Brother?
- What?

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:04.916
Your hand.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.994
Ah! My God!
What happened to my hand?

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.277
It suddenly turned into a paw.
It's an animal's hand.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.352
My hand's in bad shape.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.232
What are we going to do?

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.197
Back home we'd put some
ammonia on it.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.237
Where can we find ammonia
on this island?

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.630
They say pee contains it.
- Pee?

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.677
- Urine.
- Pee on my hand.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.354
Pee on it, Halil Ibo.
Pee on it quick.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.238
Pee.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.315
Where are you pissing?
Do it on my hand.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.676
Man you've got a lot of pee.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.035
You pissed on my hand 10 times
and we washed it with seawater.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.395
- It's still not normal.
- But the swelling's gone down?

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.677
It has, but it sure smells bad.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.431
Hold this.
Give me that.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.674
This is why I took his glasses.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.229
I'm going to reverse the lens.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.397
I rigged up a telescope to
spy on the other island.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.591
I saw his glasses dangling
from his pocket...

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.674
...and gave him a hug
to lighten his load.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.955
Let me see.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.229
Ah! They're having fun over there.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.358
Wow, wow.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.238
There are the three horsemen.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.231
They're cavoring like dolphins.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.436
Like colts, like mares.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.797
It's bombastic and fantastic.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.352
What kind of compassion is that.
A fruit basket full of all things.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.268
- Oan I see?
- Just a second, sonny.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.237
Ah, the mysteries of this world.
What wonders thou hath wrought.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.033
Oh my, she's doing suppersaults.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.077
Well, well, well,
she's doing suppersaults.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.912
- Oan I have a look?
- Hang on a second.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.039
I'm looking at something.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.076
Oh, the sweet life.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.715
The picture of contentment.
A corner of paradise.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.069
Want a look?

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.196
- Oan I?
- Go on.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.190
I tested you, and you failed.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.830
Who are you to look when I'm here?
- I'm sorry.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:20.957
Why the long face?

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.872
- I miss Tugçe.
- Who's Tugçe?

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.270
- My fiancée.
- You've got a fiancée?

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:26.316
Uh-huh.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.794
Look at you. When's the wedding?

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.111
If fate allows, when I win
the competition.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.430
So you won't have a wedding.
- Why not?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.511
Because I'm going to win.
- So be it.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.272
May the lovers be united.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.957
OK, if I win I'll
throw you a modest...

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.112
...not at all expensive, wedding.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.714
- Really?
- I promise I will.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.313
Thanks, what can I say?

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:52.073
I'll do it. I consider it a duty.
I'm like a big brother to you.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:56.278
I have known love, too.
I have experienced fickle love.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.595
Who did you love?

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.319
A woman named Sibel.
- What happened?

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.750
- I couldn't tell her.
- Why?

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:07.198
I was all ready to tell her,
after handing her the marbles.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.310
When she said she was engaged
I bottled it up inside.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.394
You've been through a lot.
- Of course I have.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.996
I'm an animal on the outside
but a baby on the inside.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:21.272
- That's you, alright.
- A real baby.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.309
- Shall I sing a folk song?
- Go on.

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:28.636
Don't lean against the pear tree.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.630
Don't trust tongues of sugar.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.518
Enough! We're sleeping over here!

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.194
OK then! Go back to sleep!

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.991
You'll be sleeping all winter,
for three months.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.550
So what if you miss one night?
Bear. Angus.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.755
She knows not the language of love.
She knows nothing of the heartstrings.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.113
They've spoiled the night.
Their hearts are coated with butter.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.113
Hello, everyone.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.190
Hello.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.750
Today we will say goodbye to a
contestant from the losing team...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.434
...after we play another
elimination challenge.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.113
This is the foam challenge.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.271
It looks funny but is difficult.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.238
First, everyone competes alone...

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.277
...and then with a partner.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.112
Do you have any questions?

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.233
Good. The first contestants
can go to the staring line.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.469
The blue team won.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.949
A girl passed you
How can a dude live that down?

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.590
We're at a critical juncture.
The blue team is up 2-1.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.032
If the blue team wins this round
they win the challenge.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.599
See what happened to us?

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.478
If we lose again they win.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.349
But if the red team wins
it will be a 2-2 tie...

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.591
...and couples will compete.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.832
The team leaders can go
to the staring line.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.274
Oome on, Recep.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.431
Taylan, you'll win.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.434
The team leaders are ready.
The competition is fierce.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.517
Oome on, Recep.
Recep!

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.989
Good job. Way to go, Recep.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.474
Oome on.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.155
2-2.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.671
That's it!
- Good job.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.232
I'm here to bury fake Hercules.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.512
I'm here to bury fake
Oonan the Barbarians.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.389
My name is Recep Ivedik.
And that's that.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.393
Oongratulations to the red team.
Taylan and Eda from the blue team...

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.632
...and Recep and Gaye from the red team
will now compete.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.949
Take your places.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.679
- Irfan?
- Yes?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.513
I hurt my leg in the last contest.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.989
I don't want to strain it worse.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.754
I'd like to withdraw if possible.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.594
What's that? No,
that's impossible.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.479
- You'll finish it out. Right, Irfan?
- What happened to your leg?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.596
- It hurts.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.751
- Please.
- That leg is just fine.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.035
It's perfectly healthy.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.397
Recep, you'll have to compete
with a female...

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.070
...so we'll pair you with Aslihan
since Gaye is injured.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.390
No way. That's impossible.
No, Irfan.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.148
Don't say that
It's out of the question.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.550
I can't compete with her
as my partner.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.113
That would be great, Irfan.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.838
It'll be nice and fun.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.475
It's impossible, Irfan.
Don't we have to slide?

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.392
Won't we be tied together?
- Yes.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.391
What will we be tied with?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.676
We'd need a towing cable.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.239
There's no rope strong enough.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.355
I can't do it. Not with her.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.397
Irfan, I'll compete if I have to.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.994
She's so eager to slide in cream.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.799
Why doesn't production give her
a few boxes of cream...

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.798
...and let her lather up and
slide all she wants?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.109
This is a contest. It's impossible.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.352
Will the couples please proceed
to the staring line?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.076
Just look at this.
It's all your fault.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.719
Are you ready?

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.996
Look, we need some acceleration...

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.879
...and you'll go like a truck
whose brakes have failed.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.952
- Momentum?
- You don't even know the word?

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.591
Velocity. Speed. Rate of change.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.559
Don'tjump the median
into our lane.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.395
What if I jumped straight onto
you without the median?

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.591
I warned you earlier.
No fighting.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.958
Let's concentrate on the game.
Are you ready?

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.914
Pull me!

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.310
Pull me?
You should have jumped there.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.516
We were anchored.
What did I tell you?

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.432
This will never work...

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.320
Speed, I said. Acceleration.
Just look at us.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.952
That's not an ass it's cushion.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.719
Pull me instead of talking.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.156
It's always a struggle with you.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.956
Damn you.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.398
The blue team won.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.433
We couldn't even make it
to the end.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.351
Irfan, will you untie me?

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.159
Will you untie me?

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.629
I'm going to cry.
Will you untie me?

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.711
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.190
We're sharing the excitement
of another elimination.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.909
As you know, a member of
the red team...

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.190
...will be leaving us tonight.
But before we proceed...

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.476
...I'd like to turn to the
team captain, Recep.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.438
Recep, you had a troubled, unhappy
performance today.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.477
Would you like to tell
us what happened?

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.870
Irfan, I feel terrible.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.757
I don't want to talk.
I'm so bummed out.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.197
As you see, the nerves of
the red team are frayed.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.919
So let's keep this short

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.149
What are you looking at?
- Look straight ahead.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.197
I'll bust yourjaw.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.119
What are you doing?

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.113
Irfan, I feel bad as it is
and he's making faces at me.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.590
Let's not make provoke
each other, Taylan.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.829
Thank you.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.839
Then it's time to begin the
elimination process.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.990
Recep? We're beginning the
elimination vote.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.752
You'll each write down a name,
staring with Recep.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.197
Look dumbo, I don't have a
personal problem with you.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.040
I like you as a person, and think
you have a good heart

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.474
But I've had it with you.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.712
With your bugs and dirt,
your lice and mud.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.031
With even that peculiar
way your skin smells.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.033
With the minutes of sleep
you steal at night.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.795
I've had it up to here with your
non-stop snoring and grumbling.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.076
I wake up to your snores
and I am ambushed by your farts.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.559
You unleash them all night long.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.837
I'm sick of living with you.
I'm sick and tired.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.877
It's time for you to go.
Leave this place.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.315
Get lost and go. We don't want
you on this island anymore.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.674
Scram. Get out of here.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.553
Go to the devil for all I care.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.038
You're a disgrace to the team.
You're no good at the games...

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.233
...or at anything else.
I've had it up to here.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.593
Halil Ibrahim.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.155
Enough. I don't want you on
this island for another second.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.356
We have no peace, day or night.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.074
We lose the games because
you keep talking.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.958
I think you should leave.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.474
I'll keep writing your name
as long as I'm on this island.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.115
I'm tired of being called
'dude' and 'hadji'.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.634
Enough.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.711
Who'd you write? Who?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.958
Recep.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.872
Huh!
- Serkan.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.073
Arif.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.317
Aslihan.
- That's it.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.078
Recep.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.471
The last one.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.190
The person written here
will compete with...

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.914
...Recep in the text voting.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.113
I assume this is Aslihan
But it's written as 'Asilhan'.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.510
I wrote Asilhan on purpose.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.360
- But you meant Aslihan.
- No, I meant Serkan.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.279
Irfan, of course I meant Aslihan.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.798
OK. The two contestants are clear.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.071
It's Recep against Aslihan.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.591
Our viewers can begin voting
by text message.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.796
- Irfan.
- Yes?

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.156
- Oan I say something?
- Of course, Recep.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.709
I have a request to make...

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.152
...of my beloved public
who are wise in all things...

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.118
...Irfan.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.511
Remove this virus, this tumor,
from the island.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.035
It's a crying shame.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.399
She's made life a living hell.
I'm suffering here.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.437
May the public save me.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.797
Recep, let's not manipulate the
public just before the vote.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.117
It's not manipulation. It's raw emotion.
I'll finish up now.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.714
My people, I'm calling on you.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.675
Save me. This girl will gnaw
me away to nothing.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.635
At night, I worry she'll bite my ears
or gnaw away at my guts.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.111
May the public remove this tumor,
this virus, from the island.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.949
Out off the cancerous finger.
Enough already, enough.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.110
Right.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.556
I'm sure the message
reached its target.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.359
If it did there's no problem.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.153
As I told you a moment ago...

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.437
...voting by text has begun.
As the viewers text we will have...

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.269
...a short commercial break and then
find out who's been eliminated.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.312
If I lose this I'll jump right
into the fire.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.080
If that cow beats me I'll make
a roast lamb of myself.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.832
Watch your mouth.
What kind of talk is that?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.718
Shut your trap.
Button it.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.479
We're going live.
Get ready.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.950
I'm even more excited now
I'm beside myself.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.112
OK, friends.
We're together again.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.471
We continue The Island live,
from where we left off.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.437
The excitement of elimination night.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.319
Text message voting is now closed.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.673
We're preparing the envelope
containing the name of...

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.831
...the person leaving The Island.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.795
If the notary is finished,
hand me the envelope.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.918
- Thank you.
- I've never seen this notary.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.594
- What's that, Recep?
- What?

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.159
- You said something?
- Yeah, I did.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.834
- What?
- I've never seen this notary.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.753
- You're fixated on the notary.
- Yes, I am.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.680
Papers come and go but I've
never seen this notary.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.910
This is a deserted island.
Where could he be?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.116
Does he wander the jungle at night?

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.715
- The notary's in Istanbul.
- How do you get cerification?

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.479
We have a live feed.
He tells us.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.279
A crew member writes down the
results and puts them in an envelope.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.950
If my aunt had a mustache
she'd be my uncle.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.154
If granny had a beard
she'd be grandpa.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.799
What are you looking at?
- Turn and look straight ahead.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.949
- What are you looking at?
- Turn round.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.838
I'll bust yourjaw.
- Just try it.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.151
I'll get you thrown off the island.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.914
Friends.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.358
Disgusting guy.
- Recep, what are you doing?

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.988
- I hocked a loogie.
- We're on the air.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.118
Oh, I didn't realize, Irfan.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.918
I thought commercials were on.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.593
OK, Recep.
I'm opening the envelope.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.990
Open it. Why do you explain
everything you do?

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.593
You're some kind of life-shortener.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.990
I'm taking the papers,
I'm opening the envelope.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.834
I'm beginning to read.
Just read it already.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.677
Who was voted off?

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.798
We're presented with
an interesting situation.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.955
The two contestants have nearly
the same votes.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.391
- Oh no...
- The person leaving the island...

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.116
...has lost by a hair.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.759
If it's a hair, I won.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.519
Friends.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.592
As the result of text voting...

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.834
...the person leaving the island
the dream of...

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.916
...the 500,000 lira prize...

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.918
Are you reading a receipt or what?
Read it faster.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.675
Friends, that person is...

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.514
...Aslihan.
- That's it. That's it.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.958
The public got it right again.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.997
Thank you, Turkey.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.236
Thank you, Turkey.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.715
With our public we will
continue to advance.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.109
We'll make great progress.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.829
They identified the microbe.
Thank you.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.315
- Yes.
- I'd like to address the public.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.232
- Go right ahead.
- I must deplore our people.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.152
- Why?
- Lf that Angus and me...

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.830
...had almost the same votes,
shame on the public.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.235
Send a few more text messages.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.351
How could I be at her level?

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.353
Shame on you,
I deplore the public.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.509
You can now bid farewell
to your friends.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.438
We are sending you off The Island.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.910
I was sick of all of it.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.680
- What?
- I was sick of it.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.709
OK, I wish you all good luck.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.634
I am sending the red and blue teams
back to their islands.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.993
The team leaders are ready.
At the sound of the whistle...

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.589
...you'll add the first 20 kilos.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.228
OK, Recep. You won.
You can drop it now.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.193
He won but he's still holding it.
And he dropped it.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.439
Burak.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.197
Recep won.
Recep takes the prize.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.110
Deniz, you can say farewell.

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.030
We now have one less person
on The Island.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.434
Another interesting celebration
from Recep.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.072
The blue team has 4 people left,
the red team 3.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.791
Recep won.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.109
The blue team has 3 people left,
the red team 2.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.238
That means that from this
moment forward...

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.117
...the rules stipulate that with
2 people left on each team...

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.831
...we merge the teams and you
compete as individuals.

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.870
Tomorrow we'll have a party to celebrate
the merging of the teams.

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.908
I'll have some of that chicken, too.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.237
I'm going to have a lot of it.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.757
And a little spaghetti.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.593
And a little Greek salad.

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.638
This is what I dreamt of.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.028
I bit that girl for this.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.395
You've ruined the whole meal.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.035
You took it all for yourself.
We're going to eat, too.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.156
You put your hand in the pasta.
You did such gross things.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.389
Sort yourself out.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.790
You've been eating with your hands
for a month and half.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.473
And now you play the gentleman?

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.437
He keeps looking at my plate.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.431
You do whatever Recep does.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.272
You eat what Recep eats.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.112
Try to be a little original.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.872
- Take it easy.
- Here, eat it all.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.235
Have some chicken from there.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.630
Gnaw on that.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.514
Do you want some, too?
You'll be hankering for some.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.829
And a little spaghetti.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.794
A little salad and garniture.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.270
You need a balanced meal.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.357
Something from the 3 food groups.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.751
A protein, a carbohydrate, a vegetable.
Salad.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.992
Eat a balanced meal and you'll stay
fit and healthy.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.753
- What's your name?
- Eda.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.956
Eda, nice. I'm Recep Ivedik.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.475
- This is Halil Ibo. Say hi to big sis.
- Hi, big sister.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.279
Big sister? You're both older than me.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.919
What's your birth year?

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.389
- I'm '7 too.
- Really? You're '87 too?

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.033
I'm '87 too.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.431
We record our births a little
late in the village.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.955
They don't register it straight away.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.829
That's because 2/3 of us
are born morons.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.833
So the family waits,
overwhelmed by grief.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.070
Some are born three-headed.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.510
We had one with eight arms,
Necmi the Octopus.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.752
It keeps happening.
Some are half-man, half-goat.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.151
We record those births at the
Ministry of Rural Affairs.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.391
We call him 'Goatboy'.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.595
But as the poet said, 'You're
only as old as you feel inside.'

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.796
What the poet means to say is
that you might look old but how...

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.598
...you feel is what's important.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.079
How old do you feel?

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.072
- 85-90.
- Why?

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.677
Life wore me out.
Life has trampled me.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.555
Poor thing. I feel for you.
- I feel for you.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.918
Eda, I see you're deep in conversation.
You must have a lot in common.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.513
Did you hear a buzzing sound?

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.911
I heard something like a
fly or a mosquito.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.471
OK, friends! Welcome.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.757
It's game time at the
team merger party.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.713
I've got a great game for you.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.077
And the name of the game is:
Limbo!

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.237
It's a simple dance game
We have two verical bars.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.960
And a horizontal pole. All you do
is go under the pole.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.793
We lower the pole a notch
each time you do. It's simple.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.633
Let me demonstrate.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.553
Music!

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.830
Explain it so it makes sense!
You're wobbling all over the place.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.195
Ok. It's easy.
You pass under the pole.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.112
Easy, you say. I haven't beaten anyone
up for one and half months.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:53.078
But I'm about to explode.
Get out of here. Get lost.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.515
It's simple, Taylan.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.557
If it's so simple, Recep,
let me make you cry uncle.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.678
- You... make me cry uncle?
- That's what I'm going to do.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.915
Oome on, let's do it.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.832
- Are you ready, Taylan?
- I'm ready.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.997
Start the music.

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.150
Bravo, Taylan made it.
It's Recep's turn. Oome on, Recep.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.993
It's easy at this level.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.111
I'm staring the music.
- Play it.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.112
Music!

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.792
Bravo, Recep! Great!

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.190
Now we lower the pole a notch.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.271
Hang on. Lower it two notches.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.599
- Two notches?
- Two, two.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.036
We're lowering it two notches.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.635
Just a minute.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.428
Oan he lower it like that?

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.789
If he wants to.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.791
OK, then I want to lower it
two more notches.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.473
- Two more?
- Two more notches.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.437
Recep is lowering it two more notches.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.670
Be careful you don't hurt yourself.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.314
Lower it another one. We've got a
wisecracker. Down another notch.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.391
- Another notch?
- Lower it one more.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.033
We're lowering it another notch.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.719
Recep, you'll wind up in the hospital.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.598
- Lower it another one.
- Are you sure?

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.035
He's egging me on.
Take it down another notch.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.510
OK, we're lowering it another notch.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.309
Now one more notch.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.914
- Oan you pass under that?
- Let's say I do.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.753
- How will you do that?
- That's none of your business.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.190
I can't get under that. I can't
lay down under that pole.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.998
You go first,
then I'll go.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.957
- OK, I'm doing it.
- OK, pass under it.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:20.596
The contest is heating up.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.069
Oan Taylan pass under it
at this height?

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.439
Music!

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.319
Taylan fell! Taylan fell!

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.870
Taylan fell!

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.838
It's not possible.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.436
No human could pass under that.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.716
Look at the shape I'm in,
and I couldn't.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.309
How can he do it with that
big belly and fat ass of his?

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.869
I'll make it.
I'm telling you I will.

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.310
If he makes it
I'll bray like a donkey.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.075
That's quite a dare.
Things have heated up even more.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.589
You'll bray like a donkey if I pass
under that pole?

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.399
- I'll bray like a donkey.
- Right here, in front of everyone?

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.278
In front of everyone.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.559
Well then, I'll lower it another...

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.518
...notch from where he lowered it.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.434
Unbelievable. What a challenge.
It could be a world record.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:17.956
So Recep, you're saying:
That's not how it's done...

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.878
...this is!
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.429
I'm throwing down the glove.
I'll show you, I'm saying.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.238
- Recep, are you ready?
- Play the music.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.919
Music!

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.192
- You're incredible.
- Amazing!

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.271
It's a limbo world record.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:44.193
You're amazing, Recep.
Bravo. Oongratulations.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.271
You get the Mr. Limbo trophy!

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.313
- Today I'm Mr. Limbo.
- Bring the trophy.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.394
Hear it one and all.
I'm Mr. Limbo.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.511
It's a nice trophy.
Thank you.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.671
I'll keep it forever.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.673
What happened? You said
I wouldn't make it.

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.030
You said my ass was too fat?

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.998
You promised to bray like a donkey.
Go on then, bray.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.673
Recep, that's just a
figure of speech.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.592
No it's not, buddy.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.274
Bray like you promised.
Here, in front of everyone.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.634
There are girls here, Recep.
You're going too far.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.155
There are female donkeys, too.
Let me hear you bray.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.833
OK, I'm braying.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.759
What was that. Are you a donkey or
an ambulance?

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.433
A donkey brays like this.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.593
Put some soul in it.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.032
Good for you. Everyone needs a
donkey like you. What's your name.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.635
- Taylan.
- Taylan the pylon. Screw you.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.637
That was a great contest.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.360
Mr. Limbo.
- Shut up. That's enough.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.035
Halil.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.635
Halil.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.956
Halil Ibo. Halil Ibo.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.479
Halil, my boy.
Halil Ibo.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.270
- What happened?
- Get up. We've got a mission.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.795
Mission? What time is it?
- A secret mission.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.510
Get me pots and pans, and rope.
No questions. Run.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.359
Oome here.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.075
What are we doing at the toilet
in the middle of the night?

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.437
Our mission has two phases.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.714
- What mission?
- Soldiers don't ask questions.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.837
You're a private.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.357
I'm a general.
Don't make me shout.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.033
I'm sorry.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.753
Open that. Pull up the seat.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.593
Take the pot.
Open it wide.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.469
I'm going to throw up.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.633
Boy they shit a lot.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.352
Lay down right here.
Lay down.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.350
I'm going to lower you down. OK?

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:54.314
I want you to fill the pot with
whatever's down there.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.357
- I'll throw up.
- No, you won't.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.313
Let's go.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.031
- Dive in.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.872
- Are you filling it?
- I'm elbow deep.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.838
Fill it up good.
Plaster that pot good.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.194
Pull me up.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.829
Get up, quick.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.718
Nice.

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.878
Oome with me. Run.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.909
What do you see over there?

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.230
- A game.
- What kind of game.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.949
- What game is that?
- Tomorrow's grand challenge.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.315
See those boxes up there...

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.152
They're full of sawdust.

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.995
We'll stand under them and hold
them shut for as long as possible.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.599
Well, what's this for then?

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.832
I want you to fill the first
box with it.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.277
We'll make sure Taylan gets that box.
And the fun begins.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.512
How can you get Taylan there?
- I'll arrange it.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.071
Go to the one on the far left
by the bushes. OK?

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.470
Fill the one on the far left.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.477
- The first one.
- Right, the first one.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.995
I'm here, OK?
I'll be the look-out.

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.590
If I hear anything, I'll run off.
I'll run away without a word.

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.797
Kudo. Oome here.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.392
You put that in front of me.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:30.632
Put it on the other end so
it doesn't block my view.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.750
OK.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.879
Quick, take these 5 things over there.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.158
Take these, quick.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.312
- Right, that's good.
- Great. Set them down.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.351
OK, go and get ready and tell me...

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.556
...when the contestants arrive.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.755
What's wrong, brother?

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.194
You filled the no. 1 box, right?
You're sure of that.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.713
Right, the first one.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.757
The one closest to the bushes?
We agree on that?

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.876
Yes, the one on the far left.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.555
OK, go to your place.
You're my little tiger.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.152
Hello, friends.
- Hello.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.551
We've got a thrilling
competition today.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.759
We've got the excitement of
both an elimination...

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.837
...and a challenge today.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.319
The person who loses the first
challenge will be leaving The Island.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.955
Then what will the remaining
contestants do?

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.477
They will be competing
for the grand prize...

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.155
...and the winner will go
home with the prize, my friends.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.596
Irfan, can I say something?
- Yes, Recep? Go on.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.797
Irfantino, I want to thank you.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.719
As the number one contestant...

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.359
...I'll be competing at the no. 1 spot.
- Yes?

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.150
To show goodwill and friendship...

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.513
...I'd like Taylan to take the
no. 1 spot and I'll compete as no. 2.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.239
Why do that?
You take it.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.994
Why should I?
You take no. 1, you idiot.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.355
Has something hit you on the head?

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.957
Look, I'm saying this for your
own good, if you want to.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.435
Well, I really have to say
that staying here...

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.039
...on the island together
has done you good.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.918
You've surprised me.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.509
Arrange things as you like.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.672
- Go on then.
- Thanks.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.916
They say something will fall
on our heads...

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.549
You'll soon get a better
idea of what they're saying.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.597
- What do you mean?
- I have no idea.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.909
If you're ready and holding
the shutters tight, let's begin.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.994
Everyone's using two hands.
I'm the only one using one.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.798
- Why?
- What's it to you?

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.635
Think you can tell me qhat to do?
I'll do what I want, Irfan.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.033
5 contestants are holding their
shutter closed.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.271
Nobody's showing signs of strain.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.197
But as the minutes pass it will
get more difficult.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.557
That kid on the end is about
to let go.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.119
- Oenk?
- Yes, Oenk.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.436
Oenk! Are going to tank?

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.280
I got a cramp in my leg.
- Oramps are terrible.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.590
You might have a stroke.
Just let go.

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.192
Oenk let go!

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.675
Oenk is out.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.672
- Halil?
- Yes?

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.434
- What are you doing?
- Don't make me talk.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.399
- Halil?
- Yes?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.352
Never mind. I won't say it.
Forget it.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.795
Brother.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.349
- Oh no.
- Halil Ibrahim let go.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:35.558
Three contestants remain.
For the prize.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.551
- Eda.
- Yes?

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.596
Do you shave your armpits with a
razor or a machine? They're so smooth.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.075
Irfan. Recep's spoiling
my concentration.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.596
Please, don't get personal during
the competition.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.195
Personal? I said armpit.
Did I say crotch?

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:53.318
What's personal about her pits.
Everyone can see them.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.239
She's on her way out. Your beauty
is enough for you. Let go.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.039
Leave gracefully.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.279
Eda let go.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.829
- There are 2 contestants left.
- Yes.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.112
Taylan, it's just you and me.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.316
I'm fine. I could stay here for
another two hours.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.675
Let's see who's made of what.
- I'm fine and dandy.

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.876
Let me know when we stop in Afyon.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.272
Hours have passed.

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.554
Look, Irfan. I've developed
five of my appendages.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.479
- What are they?
- Two arms, two legs. And my...

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.796
- Hey, quiet.
- Head, my head.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.349
Your mind is always below
the belt. My head.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.759
A chocolate fountain awaits you.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.071
Are you finding it tough?

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:42.552
I can't take. I can't believe
this guy can beat me.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.831
Let go, let go.

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.310
- Oh no!
- And Taylan let go!

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.556
Oh no! Sawdust came out.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.797
Halil, you said you filled that?
- I swear it, I did.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.315
Damn you, Halil.
You messed up bad.

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.789
- I swear I filled that one.
- I asked you.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.473
Did you say the first one,
or the second.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.916
- OK, Recep, you can let go.
- Irfan, I won, didn't I?

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.071
- Yes.
- OK, you can all go.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.878
You already won, let go.

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.474
I'm not letting go. Don't wait for me.
Go off. I'm going for the record.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.119
You already broke the record.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.635
Don't make me talk.
I'm running out of strength.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.870
- Just let go.
- Irfan Bey, he better not.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.474
- Let's intervene.
- I can't take it, Irfan. I'm shaking.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.074
- Just let go.
- God! I can't hold it anymore.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.310
- Just let go.
- God help me.

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.993
What's this?

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.117
Damn it!

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.115
I'm covered with the island's shit.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.229
What kind of champion is this?

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.834
Thanks a lot.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:46.430
I showered in shit cause of you.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.075
I took a shit shower.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.558
Rich people's shit is different.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.358
You can get the stain out
but not the smell.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.397
I swear I put it in the right place.

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:58.472
Like shit you did. If you had,
it would have spilled out on Taylan.

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.915
- And not on my head.
- I swear on my mom and dad.

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.992
Don't mix them up in this.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.035
What are you doing here?
- Washing laundry. Oan't you see?

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.476
Recep, I've got some dirty socks and
underwear. Oould you give them a scrub?

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.988
Very funny. Take her and scram.
Get out of here.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.276
I'll pierce you right in the heel.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.357
- Maniac!
- Beat it!

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.953
Set this up.
Set this up.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.589
Even water rests,
but never the enemy.

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.512
Set it up further along.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.636
Set that up there.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.398
Welcome to the grand finale
of The Island.

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.632
Thank you.

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.877
The moment we're all been waiting for
...

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.718
...has finally arrived.

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.633
One of the four contestants you
see here today will be...

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.879
...The Island champion this year
and walk away with 500,000.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.557
As you see, all the contestants
eliminated so far are here...

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.557
...to cheer you on.

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:11.837
I'd like to thank you all.
Thank you, friends.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.272
Let's begin the first challenge
of the final day.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:18.552
We begin with Recep and Taylan.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.519
- What are you looking at?
- What is it?

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.079
- Mind your business.
- Shut up.

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.951
Now you see it, now you don't.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.589
Nobody gets past me.

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.716
Bang bang! 2-0.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.159
And Recep wins 3 out of 3.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.512
I give from the right,
and from the left.

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.030
And one right up the middle.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.199
It's 1-1.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.669
And Halil Ibrahim won.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.992
And 3-2. Recep went from 2-0
to 3-2 to win.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.076
It'll be a pleasure to watch
the ladies compete.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.708
- Shut up.
- Get lost. Button it.

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.116
The women are competing.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.795
And 3-0. Taylan gets another
point with no losses.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.554
Taylan caught it.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.592
Winning 3-0, Taylan gets
another point.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.792
Eda caught it! Eda's up 2-0.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.594
Not like this, Irfan.
I can't concentrate.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.069
I can't put forward my best game.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.276
- Why?
- Because of those boobies.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.557
When the baton pops up
they're right in front of my eyes.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.109
- Put on a T-shirt
- Keep your eyes to yourself.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.076
I'd have come topless, Irfan.
I'd have come naked if I'd known.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.078
If I do this I won't see them.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.029
- Doesn't he have to lower his hand?
- You turned out to be a bad egg, Eda.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.437
And Recep caught it!

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.149
Eda says farewell to The Island.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.948
We're clapping for Eda, friends.

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.590
We move on to the second of the 2
games for The Island final.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.034
The excitement mounts.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.273
Oh! Oh! Oh boy.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.232
Sorry.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.593
And Recep wins!

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.394
And that's it.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.958
Recep, what are you doing?

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.958
And Taylan wins!

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.038
Halil Ibrahim says goodbye to
us this round.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.993
I'm still in the game.
Don't let it bother you.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.878
- Good luck.
- Lf I win...

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:58.230
...it'll be like you've won.
Understand?

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.913
Like Turkey in WWI.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.878
When Germany was defeated we were
considered defeated, too.

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.669
We applaud Halil Ibrahim as we
send him off the island.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.309
Olap for the boy.
Give the boy a hand.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.152
- Don't gesture like that.
- He was your rival.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.833
- Why should I clap for him!
- Shameful prick.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.118
We've all been waiting breathlessly
for this moment.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.313
This is the final and last game.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.989
Two contestants who have been...

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:29.232
...Iocked in a fierce battle
since they arrived on the island...

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.317
...now face off in the final.

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.233
That's right. The 500,000 prize...

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.592
...is just 3 penalty shots away
in The Island championship game.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.835
- Irfan?
- Yes.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.991
I want to say something. It's the
end of the competition...

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.116
...and I'd like to make a speech.
- Oertainly. Go right ahead.

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.273
I'm happy to see all our friends
who were eliminated here.

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.273
I release them from all moral
obligations they might have to me.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:54.034
And I ask them to do the same.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.350
Good for you, Recep.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.596
- Bravo, Recep.
- Thank you.

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.035
And I want to say something
about Taylan.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:05.432
His making it to the final
is a great achievement.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.876
There can only be one champion.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.555
He'll be the champion of hearts,
which is an achievement.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.758
Taylan, would you like to respond?

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.837
I'd like to say something to Recep.
- Please do.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.639
You're in trouble. I played pro
football for seven years.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.234
I won't hurt you too bad, don't worry.
- Look at him.

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.914
I played for seven years.
Do you know what that means?

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.799
I'm talking about humanity.
He's still talking about the game.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.396
He's a slimeball. Pure and simple.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.875
I take back what I said earlier...

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.072
...and will speak the only language
he understands.

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.436
If he played for seven years,
I played a lifetime...

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.148
...for Dinamo Güngören.
- It looks to me like...

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.676
...the rivalry between these two
had reached an all-time high.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.035
And the final game will reflect that.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.990
Taylan will take the first penalty kick.
Recep will be goalkeeper.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.229
Are you ready, Recep?
- I'm always ready, Irfan.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.749
- Taylan, are you ready?
- I'm always ready, too.

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.071
May the best man win
The Island championship.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:14.237
Taylan scores. He's up
1-0 with his first kick.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.159
Taylan goes to the goal.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.274
Recep scores.
- That's how it's done!

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.630
It's tied at 1-1.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.709
- Are you ready?
- Oome on.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.950
Only a coward would fear you.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:44.353
Taylan misses.
- That's how it's done.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.671
You're going to taste my paw.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.118
The score is still tied
but the advantage is Recep's.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.558
And Recep misses!

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.751
Damn it.

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.515
Recep misses! It's still a tie,
1-1.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.558
Stop showing off and go
to the school.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.836
Shut your face.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:20.319
- Taylan misses again.
- That's they way.

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.520
Recep saves and it's still a tie.
Recep gets the last kick.

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.519
This is a critical moment.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.360
If Recep makes it,
he'll be this season's...

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.757
...The Island Ohampion.
But if Taylan saves...

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.753
...we'll continue with extra
kime penalty kicks.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.156
I'll do it for you, kids.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.799
I'll do it for you.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.438
- Irfan.
- Yes.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:57.959
Oan we wear shoes?

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.716
Sure, but where will you
find shoes now?

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:03.075
I'd like to use his.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.037
Will it fit you?

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.994
Oould you give me those shoes?
Your shoes.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.515
I'll wear them for one round.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.752
Just the shoes I wanted, Irfan.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.152
I can do a toe-kick.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:55.109
That's it!
That's it.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.869
I'm the champ! Yes! Yes!

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.356
They battled for days, weeks, months.

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.432
Someone would emerge champion.

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:06.558
The winner of the 500,000 prize

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.116
...and The Island championship
is Recep Ivedik.

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:46.549
- What's this?
- I brought your money.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.394
- Oh my.
- Yeah.

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.759
See. See.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.516
Here's your nice shiny money.

01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.557
You can count until morning.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.314
Let that be a lesson to you.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.193
I hereby turn over the field to
our kids...

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.031
...using the gold scissors provided...

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.953
...to officially open this football field.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.317
Here we go, in the name of God.
May it be auspicious.

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.116
OK, you can all get in.
- Yes, we're all in.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.317
OK, did you take it?

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:34.109
Yes, it looks great.
Enjoy it.
