Ooh!

09:02.075 --> 09:04.044
* So sit back, relax,
and just watch me *

09:04.044 --> 09:06.580
* Climbing up onto his ass crack
and back fat *

09:06.580 --> 09:09.082
* Ending up on his dome
for some payback *

09:09.082 --> 09:10.918
Shit!

09:12.252 --> 09:14.121
And, oh!
Right in the fontanel.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.590
That was a puny attempt
to stop me.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.226
The proportions
between these gladiators

09:19.226 --> 09:20.460
is skewed to be sure.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.262
But, oh, no!
There he is.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.263
He's done it.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.632
Gene,
what do you think?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.734
You can't get a guy
this big in a --

09:26.734 --> 09:28.736
Oh, and he did!
Apparently you can!

09:28.736 --> 09:30.738
What are you doing?

09:30.738 --> 09:33.440
[ Screams ]

09:33.440 --> 09:34.441
[ Splash ]

09:34.441 --> 09:35.909
Hey, skipper.
Thanks, mate.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.278
We were in real trouble
back there.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.480
Yeah, yeah,
amazing stuff.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.415
So who are you, exactly?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.784
I'm Apollo Gauntlet.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.620
I'm on a quest
to undo the Oracles of Doom.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.656
No, wait.
That's wrong.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.523
I'm Paul Cassidy from Earth.

09:50.523 --> 09:54.427
Well, whatever your name is,
we're on a quest to find beer.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.929
Why don't you join us?

09:55.929 --> 09:59.099
First day on the job, though,
that wasn't so bad.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.133
Yeah, no.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.202
I-I think we're
a good team, actually.

10:02.202 --> 10:06.539
Great, well, we'll see
what happens, I guess.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.977
Hey -- Hey, guys,
uh, wait up.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.146
**

10:17.818 --> 10:21.989
* Fights evil
even when it's not there *

10:21.989 --> 10:25.993
* Here comes Apollo Gauntlet

10:25.993 --> 10:30.130
* Fighting for goodness
in everyone *

10:30.130 --> 10:34.067
* Put on your magic gauntlets

10:34.067 --> 10:37.871
* Wait for the proper time

10:37.871 --> 10:43.410
* You fight the evil
even though it's everywhere *

10:43.410 --> 10:45.713
* It's everywhere

10:45.713 --> 10:49.850
* Here comes Apollo Gauntlet

10:52.085 --> 10:55.255
