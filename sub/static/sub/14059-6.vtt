In the woods,

I wanna give it to Pete.

‐ You can't bribe Pete.
‐ I have to try.

00:08.809 --> 00:12.045
What did you do with Pete?
You‐‐ You killed him.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.414
I hit him, and then‐‐
But he fought back.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.149
What if someone
comes looking for him?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.652
‐ You said yourself
he didn't have any friends.
‐ What happened with Pete?

00:18.719 --> 00:21.588
‐ Did he take the money?
‐ Pete went home.

to locate Pete Mincey.

There you go.
So this is what

00:38.672 --> 00:40.774
I wanted to see you.

He and Jim are friends.
I guess you could say
we've come to an understanding.

00:53.486 --> 00:56.957
I just want a chance,
you know?

00:57.023 --> 00:59.359
To change my life.

00:59.425 --> 01:02.128
And I want to stop lyin'.

01:02.195 --> 01:05.699
‐ Why are you living in a tent?
‐ He thinks the house
is stealing our souls.

01:05.766 --> 01:09.503
Rather be piss‐poor with my dad
than $13 million richer
with whoever you are.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.272
Where you headed, Cael?
Just hittin' the road.

No, no.
I'm looking for Pete Mincey.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.442
You're looking for Pete?

01:50.911 --> 01:53.313
Would you like to sit down
or somethin' to drink?

01:53.379 --> 01:56.316
Uh, I'm fine.
This good?

01:56.382 --> 01:58.318
Sure.
Thank you.

01:58.384 --> 02:01.421
So, Pete is missing?

02:01.487 --> 02:04.825
Well, he's disappeared.
His mother hired me to find him.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.829
You haven't seen him recently,
have you, Mrs. Rich?
Well, sure.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.264
He came to visit me
and my husband about a week ago,

02:11.331 --> 02:14.134
and, uh, he was in town
a couple nights.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.671
Mr. Landry‐‐
Please, please,
call me Chet.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.341
Chet. Why do you think
he's missing?

02:21.407 --> 02:25.278
Well, his mama's birthday
came and went, and she didn't
get a call from her boy.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.581
<i>She became worried.</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:31.585
She had her... neighbor
contact me.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.087
I'm an old friend.
Of Pete's mother's?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.089
Of the neighbors.
Oh.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.093
So, you don't actually
know Pete?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.328
‐ No.
‐ Hmm.

02:45.231 --> 02:48.669
And, uh, I hope she
also called the police.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.772
‐ Oh, I convinced her not to.
‐ Really?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.641
Oh, I find police work
in these matters sloppy
and incompetent.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.376
Really?
Yeah.

02:56.442 --> 03:00.313
Mrs. Rich, I have to ask
you somethin' that's not gonna
be easy for you to talk about.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.717
<i>His mother mentioned</i>
<i>that you and Pete...</i>

03:03.784 --> 03:06.687
might have had
a special relationship.

03:06.753 --> 03:11.257
‐ What?
‐ That he loved you, Mrs. Rich.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.426
Oh, I see.

03:13.493 --> 03:17.698
Now, I've spoken
to Leif Sohlberg,
his therapist,

03:17.764 --> 03:20.166
and apparently,
Pete called him
while he was here...

03:20.233 --> 03:22.368
and said he was
in a kind of a crisis.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.572
Now, that crisis
didn't involve you, did it?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.575
Did your husband find out
about the relationship?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.811
Did Pete and Doug
perhaps have an argument?

03:30.877 --> 03:33.947
No. Look, I gotta
be honest with you.

03:34.014 --> 03:38.484
He may have had feelings for me,
but he never ever acted on 'em.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.554
You know what I mean?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.823
I mean, he was goin'
through so much.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.792
I had no idea.
I mean, if I had,
maybe I could have helped him.

03:45.859 --> 03:49.930
So if you had any information,
I would hope that
you would come forward.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.565
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.768
Well‐‐
Oh, my God. He‐‐

03:54.835 --> 03:59.305
He came over for dinner, and he
was telling us all about losing
his job and his divorce and all,

03:59.372 --> 04:02.776
and then he said
at one point,

04:02.843 --> 04:06.647
"I wish I could just walk away,
just start all over again."

04:06.713 --> 04:09.449
I mean, I knew
he was unhappy, but‐‐

04:11.885 --> 04:15.589
I guess I‐‐ I didn't
know to what extent.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.694
You don't write much down,
do you, Mr. Landry?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.696
I do not.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.466
I keep most of it
up here.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.603
Well, this‐‐ this notebook's
just a crutch.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.006
Sort of like
a security blanket, huh?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.277
I think I've taken up
enough of your time.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.480
Sorry I'm the bearer
of bad news.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.849
Oh, it's all right.

04:42.916 --> 04:46.119
Look, I just assumed
your husband would have
told you all about it.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.622
You talked to my husband?

04:48.689 --> 04:53.527
Of course. The best friend
missing and all‐‐ I'm surprised
he didn't mention it.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.496
Well, you have
a nice day now, Mrs. Rich.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.789
Chet Landry? What the hell!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.925
I was gonna tell you
about him.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.962
I didn't know that you talked to
him until he was leaving, Wayne!

05:29.029 --> 05:32.699
How could you be
so goddamn careless? Huh?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.801
We could have got
our stories mixed up.
<i>You're right.</i>

05:34.868 --> 05:37.638
I have been just so worried
about this Bayou Hills thing‐‐

05:37.704 --> 05:39.305
You understand
we're a P. I.'s wet dream?

05:39.372 --> 05:42.208
He could have seen a picture
of Doug and Cherien
on the Internet.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.679
No. We've been careful, baby.
Cael went through every photo
and he switched 'em out.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.682
What if he had a picture of Doug
and Cherien on him? Huh?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.951
Maybe that happened. Shit!

05:51.017 --> 05:55.155
He's not looking for the Riches.
He's looking for Pete.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.591
So now we stick to the plan.

05:57.658 --> 06:02.563
To do the con, we close the deal
in one month, we get our money
and we are gone.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.736
No one's heard from Pete
since he left our place.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.482
One minute.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.858

That's a great deal.

Have you ever bought a car?
No.

I guarantee Dave Wilkinson
will deliver the first 50 homes

Now, if you shift
your attention to page four,

10:52.418 --> 10:55.522
this graph will show you
the cost and profit ratio.

Good. Remember those
little hors d'oeuvre forks...

where your black friend
outed Jim?

Oh, that'd be cute.
Yeah, I think they're
in my kitchen somewhere.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.897

11:46.439 --> 11:49.976
You can let your staff
take a look at that later.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.112
The point here is,
sure, I can do the work.

Every guy who comes in here
can do the work, right?

11:54.447 --> 11:57.217
I mean, we wouldn't be up here

11:57.283 --> 12:01.454
Here's what makes me different.
Two things‐‐ numbers.
