[THEME SONG PLAYING]

00:36.603 --> 00:39.271
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
Hell no! Hell no!

00:39.273 --> 00:40.639
-Dad, what's wrong?
-What is it, Michael?

00:40.641 --> 00:42.441
We got termites again.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.744
They said they got rid of 'em,
but they obviously
did not get rid of 'em.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.913
Dad, I don't even
think it's moving.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.115
Are you sure it's a termite?

00:50.117 --> 00:51.717
Marquess, go float
up there and see.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.319
Oh, I don't know
if I can go that high.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.488
Well, you won't know
if you won't try, Marquess.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.358
My goodness gracious!
This is our home!

00:59.360 --> 01:02.127
You just gonna sit here
while that bug eats it all up?

01:02.129 --> 01:03.762
Fine!

01:03.764 --> 01:05.931
(GRUNTING)

01:05.933 --> 01:07.199
(SIGHS)

01:09.569 --> 01:12.004
Come on, Marquess,
you can do it.

01:12.006 --> 01:15.107
PIGEON: Is one of you
shitting in the kitchen again?

01:15.109 --> 01:17.109
(SIGHS) I can't do it.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.111
I don't know how to go up.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.146
Yeah, you just, you just...

01:21.148 --> 01:24.716
You just know how to go
down, right? (LAUGHS)

01:26.553 --> 01:28.120
What are you
even talking about?

01:28.122 --> 01:29.988
Like, get down on your knees.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.657
(BLEEP) man, I'm...

01:33.893 --> 01:35.527
What is wrong with you?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.863
Pigeon, we think
we got termites again.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.132
Fly up there and see
if that's a termite.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.302
I can't (BLEEP) fly.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.037
Then how do you eat?

01:45.039 --> 01:46.738
How do you catch a prey?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.842
Don't you swoop down
and eat worms and mices,

01:49.844 --> 01:52.444
and little (BLEEP) critters?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.680
I eat the same
(BLEEP) you eat.

01:54.682 --> 01:59.852
I'm a human being.
I came in here for
a (BLEEP) bowl of cereal.

01:59.854 --> 02:03.288
Now, one of you
insensitive assholes is gonna
put this in a bowl for me?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.224
Has anyone noticed,
I don't have (BLEEP) hands?

02:05.226 --> 02:07.025
(BLEEP), you guys are rude.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.195
What? You just told me
I (BLEEP) men off
and I'm rude. Okay.

02:10.197 --> 02:14.633
Yeah,
it's a defense mechanism,
you (BLEEPING) eater

02:15.635 --> 02:18.470
I'm the victim here.
I'm (BLEEP) handicapped!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
If I was in
a (BLEEP) wheelchair,

02:20.407 --> 02:23.375
you assholes would be
falling all over yourselves
to pour me cereal.

02:23.377 --> 02:27.880
Is that what I need to do?
Get a little wheelchair to
remind you that I'm disabled?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.952
I don't know
about a wheelchair,

02:33.954 --> 02:36.355
but I think Pigeon would
look cute in a little car,
you know,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.757
like a little
remote control sports car.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.027
I bet if we can each
put in five bucks,
we can get him one.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.729
You know, that would be fun

02:43.731 --> 02:45.998
to, you know, to watch
that Pigeon ride
around in a little car.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.935
Like, when you know,
um, when they show on
the news like, something like

02:49.937 --> 02:52.337
a squirrel, you know,
riding around
on a skate board.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.972
Now, that shit is cute.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.011
Well, the good news is
that's not a termite.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.612
Yeah, I didn't think so.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.414
It looks like spaghetti sauce.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.616
Maybe a little
cooking splatter.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.319
But the bad news is, I did
see termites in the attic.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.787
We got an attic? Ooh.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.455
Well, team, say good-bye
to the house.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.657
We got to burn it down.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.425
What? No, we can tent it.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.260
Uh-huh. I'm listening.

03:15.262 --> 03:18.230
Specialized tarps are placed
over the entire structure.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.400
They're weighted at the bottom
to create a seal
and hold in the fumigant,

03:21.402 --> 03:25.204
penetrating all
wood timbers, trim,
finished wood and furniture,

03:25.206 --> 03:27.206
as well as
hard-to-treat wall studs.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.474
You can safely
return home in 2-3 days.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.177
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.812
Could you please repeat that?

03:33.814 --> 03:36.448
Well, specialized tarps
are placed over
the entire structure.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.485
They're weighted at the bottom
to create a seal
and hold in the fumigant,

03:40.487 --> 03:43.288

03:43.290 --> 03:45.524
as well as
hard-to-treat wall studs.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.493
You can safely
return home in 2-3 days.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.029
Okay, that time
I was listening.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.232
But I stopped listening
sometime in the middle.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.133
Maybe one more time?

03:55.135 --> 03:56.868
Third time's a charm?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.904
EXTERMINATOR: (SIGHS)
Specialized tarps are...

03:58.906 --> 04:01.773
Can you believe
how many times I got
that (BLEEP) to say that?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.908
(LAUGHS)

04:02.910 --> 04:04.543
YUNG: Wait.
What are we doing here?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.745
I thought we were
going to a hotel.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.982
MIKE: We're not going anywhere
till we change out of these
termite-infested clothes.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.117
YUNG: What?
MARQUESS: Termites
don't eat clothing.

04:12.119 --> 04:15.687
Oh, I'm sorry, Marquess,
are you an expert in termites?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.090
Did you go to college
and major in termites?

04:18.092 --> 04:21.426
No, you went to
Cambridge University in 1864,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.329
and left two years later,
without a degree.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.098
I read it on the Internet.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.599
Oh, you read it, Michael?

04:27.601 --> 04:30.302
I also read on there
something very upsetting about

04:30.304 --> 04:32.971
you and this great poet
Oscar Wilde.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.708
But that is a conversation
for another day.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.944
I got some old stuff
in here we can wear.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.812
Can't we just go to the mall
and buy new stuff?

04:40.814 --> 04:43.081
Yung, I'm already
spending $3,000

04:43.083 --> 04:45.317
to have a fumigant
dispensed into our house,

04:45.319 --> 04:49.621
so it can penetrate
all of our wood timbers
and hard-to-treat wall studs.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.556
No, we wear my old shit.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.158
Everyone take your
clothes off now!

04:53.160 --> 04:55.260
-What?
-PIGEON: Don't talk back
to your father!

04:55.262 --> 04:58.363
I'm not getting naked.
Especially not
in front of him.

04:58.365 --> 05:03.035
I mean, this is ridiculous.
Marquess, you agree
with me, right?

05:03.037 --> 05:06.772
Holy lord! Why is your body
so perfect? What's that for?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.740
Wow! Do you just stare
at yourself in the mirror?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.376
I mean, that is
a great-looking body.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.312
-Thank you.
-(CHUCKLING) Yeah. Whoa!

05:13.314 --> 05:16.048
To think this whole time,
I've been jacking off
to the wrong person.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.649
-No offense, Yung.
-(YUNG SIGHS)

05:17.651 --> 05:20.452
Found it! Here's my old trunk.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.654
A couple of old
Team Tyson t-shirts.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.690
Man, some track pants.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.392
Ooh! My old boom box.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.695
Does anybody have
nine D batteries on 'em?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.396
I bet Marquess does.

05:31.398 --> 05:34.333
Marquess,
what kind of batteries
does your dildo take?

05:34.335 --> 05:37.803
Uh, dildos don't
take batteries,
those are vibrators, so...

05:37.805 --> 05:39.271
(CHUCKLES) Joke's on you.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.772
Ha!

05:40.774 --> 05:43.408
What? Wait, this is where
we're staying? A casino?

05:43.410 --> 05:46.511
MIKE: By the way,
you're welcome for
giving you guys the t-shirts.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.213
Damn, it's freezing in here!

05:48.215 --> 05:52.017
Hot as (BLEEP) outside,
then all the places have
the AC cranked up?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.019
Got to get the blood flowing,
gotta get warm.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.954
WOMAN: Oh, damn!
That's Mike Tyson.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.490
MARQUESS: Why is everyone
staring at us?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.991
I don't know.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.194
How come we're not playing
that boom box, Marquess?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.496
We stopped and got
all those damn batteries.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.232
Otherwise, that was
a wasted trip.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.468

$2,000 for champagne?

06:17.344 --> 06:19.010
What?

06:19.012 --> 06:21.880
(SIGHS) Oh, man!
I left my phone at the house.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.382
Hope they haven't
tented it yet.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.984
Dad, I'm going back
to the house to get my phone.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.119
Okay, honey.

06:27.121 --> 06:30.188
Hey! You guys wanna
go down to the pool?

06:30.190 --> 06:33.024
I'm good, thanks. I think
I'm gonna just hit the slots.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.663
I'd rather not be there
when he gets kicked out
of the pool for masturbating.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.099
$28 for a chocolate bar?

06:42.034 --> 06:44.503
Ugh, great!
It's already tented.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.837
What the (BLEEP)?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.908

-Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.370
-One second, honey.
<i>-Dad!</i>

07:18.372 --> 07:21.273
Would you like for me
to leave it here
or set it up for you?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.474
Okay, set it up please.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.842
<i>Dad, this is an emergency.</i>

07:23.844 --> 07:25.076
Would you like it
by the window,

07:25.078 --> 07:26.678
or would you like it
by the sofa?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.247
Oh, wow. I haven't thought
about either of those options.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.584
Why don't you try
both places and we'll see
which one feels best?

-Just one second, baby.
<i>-Dad!</i>

07:34.721 --> 07:36.755

07:36.757 --> 07:38.790
Okay, here's option one.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.726
Yeah, feels good,
but I worry about the glare.

07:41.728 --> 07:42.994
Um, let's try the sofa.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.296

07:44.298 --> 07:46.164
Be with you

Oh, my God.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.733
<i>They're doing</i>
<i>some crazy ritual.</i>

07:48.735 --> 07:50.202
-Okay, here's option two.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.237
-This seems right...
<i>-Dad, listen.</i>

07:52.239 --> 07:54.973
...but it just doesn't feel
special enough.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.808
Can we try option one again?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.410

Are you serious?
Okay, don't worry,
I'm on my way.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.886

08:07.888 --> 08:10.021
Oh, I'm gonna beat the (BLEEP)

-Oh, oh, of course.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.594
Oh, oops!

08:15.596 --> 08:18.763
I added a gratuity,
I didn't see there was
already a service charge.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.700
Is it okay
if I just cross that out?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.502
Seems a little
excessive, right?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.872

Why am I making such
a big deal out of this?

you shouldn't get two tips?

If you don't want somebody
to masturbate by the pool,

08:43.190 --> 08:46.791
then you put a (BLEEP) sign up
that says "Don't masturbate
by the (BLEEP) pool!"

I mean, I could sleep
with anyone I want.
I just haven't wanted to,

09:03.110 --> 09:06.378
so that's the only reason
I'm a virgin, you know.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.347
And I'm sure
it's gonna happen soon,
so, you know, if...

09:09.349 --> 09:11.650
If this whole thing
is dependent on me
being a virgin,

09:11.652 --> 09:16.254
then you guys lucked out,
because, like, tomorrow,
if I wanted to,
