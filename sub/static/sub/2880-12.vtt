00:14.891 --> 00:18.076
This is nice,
that we all get to eat together.

00:18.078 --> 00:18.893
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:18.895 --> 00:20.078
Absolutely.

00:22.998 --> 00:24.199
Hmm.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.919
Can we maybe
put the phones down

00:27.921 --> 00:29.888
and have an actual
human conversation?

00:29.890 --> 00:31.089
We can,

00:31.091 --> 00:32.707
but thanks
to Steve Jobs,

00:32.709 --> 00:34.926
we don't have to.

00:35.928 --> 00:36.994
Guys, guys,

00:36.996 --> 00:38.046
you're never gonna believe this.

00:38.048 --> 00:40.381
What happened?
I just got a part on a TV show!

00:40.383 --> 00:41.883
What? That's great!
Congratulations!

00:41.885 --> 00:42.801
Guys!

00:42.803 --> 00:44.269
Oh, yeah!

00:44.271 --> 00:45.220
Yay, Penny!

00:46.188 --> 00:47.806
What's the show?

00:47.808 --> 00:50.191
Um, NC...II...

00:50.193 --> 00:52.944
or, you know, NCSTD...
I don't know,

00:52.946 --> 00:55.280
it's-it's the one

00:55.282 --> 00:56.898
with the letters and
I'm gonna be on it!

00:56.900 --> 00:58.900
That's amazing.
Yeah.

00:58.902 --> 00:59.834
What's your part?

00:59.836 --> 01:01.519
Um, I play a customer
in a diner

01:01.521 --> 01:03.288
and I flirt
with Mark Harmon.

01:03.290 --> 01:04.706
Ooh, Mark Harmon,

01:04.708 --> 01:06.658
he's a dreamboat.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.377
So i-it's just flirting?

01:09.379 --> 01:10.528
Well, yeah. Why?

01:10.530 --> 01:11.546
Uh, no reason.

01:11.548 --> 01:12.547
I just think it's sexier

01:12.549 --> 01:14.110
when things are left
to the imagination.

01:16.719 --> 01:19.137

01:48.401 --> 01:51.353
So I-I read a study that
says a man with a dog

01:51.355 --> 01:53.905
is three times more likely
to get a woman's phone number.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.007
Is it true even when
the man lets his dog

01:56.009 --> 01:58.543
lick peanut butter
off his tongue?

01:58.545 --> 02:00.946
I don't see why not.

02:02.281 --> 02:03.682
If you're really
desperate to meet women

02:03.684 --> 02:05.784
and like having food
eaten out of your mouth,

02:05.786 --> 02:07.986
I could set you up
with my mom.

02:09.322 --> 02:11.322
Why is that funny?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.576
That's just unhygienic.

02:15.595 --> 02:16.545
It's a joke.

02:16.547 --> 02:18.380
I don't think so.

02:19.248 --> 02:20.766
I believe that a joke

02:20.768 --> 02:22.350
is a brief oral narrative

02:22.352 --> 02:24.553
with a climactic
humorous twist.

02:24.555 --> 02:27.556
For example, uh,
Wolowitz's mother is so fat

02:27.558 --> 02:29.775
that she decided
to go on a diet...

02:29.777 --> 02:33.011
or exercise, or both.

02:35.181 --> 02:36.648
See?

02:36.650 --> 02:39.985
The twist is that people
don't usually change.

02:43.239 --> 02:46.208
Well, they don't.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.659
Hey, guys, don't forget,

02:47.661 --> 02:49.461
my episode's on TV
tomorrow night.

02:49.463 --> 02:50.796
We'll be there.
Can we bring anything?

02:50.798 --> 02:51.830
Oh, that's so sweet of you,

02:51.832 --> 02:53.381
but I was gonna steal food
from here.

02:53.383 --> 02:56.551
You know... my treat.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.503
Wait, if Howard's
mother is coming,

02:58.505 --> 03:00.538
then you should
also steal marbles.

03:05.011 --> 03:06.428
Because she's obese,

03:06.430 --> 03:07.813
and hippos are obese,

03:07.815 --> 03:09.848
and in the popular board game
"Hungry Hungry Hippos,"

03:09.850 --> 03:11.683
they eat marbles.

03:16.489 --> 03:19.074
Maybe I need to dumb
these down for you.

03:21.611 --> 03:23.728
Leonard, do you
think I'm funny?

03:23.730 --> 03:24.913
No.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.951
Do you?

03:29.953 --> 03:32.170
I think I'm hysterical.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.789
I take it back.

03:34.791 --> 03:37.876
That was funny.

03:37.878 --> 03:39.928
The philosopher
Henri Bergson

03:39.930 --> 03:41.246
says it's funny

03:41.248 --> 03:44.266
when a human being
behaves like an object.

03:44.268 --> 03:46.918
I bet that bit killed
at The Chuckle Hut.

03:49.055 --> 03:50.939
Oh, he didn't perform
stand-up comedy,

03:50.941 --> 03:53.141
he was a philosopher.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.811
You know, I think
we're zeroing in on your problem.

03:58.397 --> 04:00.615
Perhaps I'll
spend some time

04:00.617 --> 04:02.984
developing a unified
theory of comedy,

04:02.986 --> 04:05.403
which will allow me
to elicit laughter

04:05.405 --> 04:06.821
from anyone
at any time.

04:06.823 --> 04:08.406
Unless they're German,

04:08.408 --> 04:11.243
'cause that's a tough crowd.

04:11.245 --> 04:14.829
Are you set on people
laughing <i>with</i> you?

04:14.831 --> 04:17.132
'Cause if you're
cool with <i>at</i> you...

04:23.723 --> 04:26.007
I don't get it.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.010
Raj, when you said you
were gonna bring a date

04:29.012 --> 04:30.145
to watch Penny's
thing tonight,

04:30.147 --> 04:31.680
I didn't think
you meant Stuart.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.100
Really?

04:35.102 --> 04:36.467
I never for a second

04:36.469 --> 04:38.970
thought it'd be
anything else.

04:38.972 --> 04:41.690
I almost met someone
last night, but I blew it.

04:41.692 --> 04:43.491
I was walking Cinnamon

04:43.493 --> 04:45.076
and this girl
introduced herself,

04:45.078 --> 04:47.195
but she was so cute I panicked

04:47.197 --> 04:48.947
and said,
"Wouldn't it be easier

04:48.949 --> 04:51.783
if instead of talking we could
just sniff each other's butts?"

04:52.919 --> 04:55.754
Well, Stuart's cute
in his own way.

04:55.756 --> 04:56.922
When I was a baby,

04:56.924 --> 04:59.124
my mother called me
her little possum.

04:59.126 --> 05:00.959
Are possums cute?

05:00.961 --> 05:02.994
Not at all.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.380
If you're so intimidated

05:05.382 --> 05:07.165
by talking to
attractive girls,

05:07.167 --> 05:08.550
maybe you should practice

05:08.552 --> 05:09.935
by talking to
regular people.

05:09.937 --> 05:12.971
You mean like fatties and uggos?

05:14.006 --> 05:16.441
Or maybe just stop talking.

05:16.443 --> 05:18.026
I'm serious.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.145
Go to the mall,
talk to anybody,

05:20.147 --> 05:21.229
practice-- that way,

05:21.231 --> 05:22.897
when you eventually do
talk to a cute girl,

05:22.899 --> 05:24.032
it won't be so scary.

05:24.034 --> 05:26.568
Or just keep dating the possum.

05:29.405 --> 05:32.958
Parsa doesn't have
those kind of resources.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.860
No, and that's why he had
Erin Pace rewire it...

05:35.862 --> 05:37.078
I'm so proud of you.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.438
We haven't even
gotten to my scene yet.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.205
I know,
but you're going to be a TV star

05:40.206 --> 05:42.559
and you haven't left me yet.
That takes guts.

05:44.804 --> 05:46.021
I don't know about you,

05:46.023 --> 05:47.672
but I'm very
uncomfortable with all this.

05:47.674 --> 05:50.942
Why?
I've never seen this show before

05:50.944 --> 05:53.711
and now I'm starting
with episode 246?

05:55.514 --> 05:57.732
It's unnatural.

05:57.734 --> 06:01.386
Just think of the first 245
as the prequel.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.155
All right.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.225
Okay, shh.
Guys, guys, this is it.

06:07.227 --> 06:09.611
I guess it's you and me, kid.

06:09.613 --> 06:11.279
What are you doing?

06:11.281 --> 06:12.897
I'm trying to make peace.

06:12.899 --> 06:13.999
We're good.
Good.

06:14.001 --> 06:15.834
Really? Because...
Are you kidding me?

06:15.836 --> 06:17.068
What's wrong?

06:17.070 --> 06:18.920
Well... the diner scene.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.538
Where's my diner scene?

06:20.540 --> 06:21.589
Well, don't ask me.

06:21.591 --> 06:24.242
Until I see the prequel,
I'm lost.

06:24.244 --> 06:25.794
No, there was supposed
to be a big scene

06:25.796 --> 06:26.761
with me and Mark Harmon,

06:26.763 --> 06:28.713
but i-it's... gone.

06:28.715 --> 06:29.848
What happened?

06:29.850 --> 06:32.050
They must've cut it.

06:32.052 --> 06:34.219
Oh, Penny...

06:35.054 --> 06:36.721
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:36.723 --> 06:38.390
That stinks.
I'm sure you were great.

06:38.392 --> 06:39.858
This doesn't make any sense.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.026
I mean, I...

06:41.028 --> 06:43.478
I thought I did a...
a really good job, I...

06:45.731 --> 06:47.916
Excuse me.

06:52.405 --> 06:55.490
I've been studying how
to make people laugh.

06:58.911 --> 07:00.295
They say that comedy

07:00.297 --> 07:02.497
is tragedy plus time.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.834
Let's tickle some ribs.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.456
No, Dad,

07:11.458 --> 07:13.591
I don't think they
cut me out of the show

07:13.593 --> 07:15.593
because I was too pretty.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.013
No, I don't need
you to come out

07:19.015 --> 07:21.783
and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.686
Daddy, I gotta go.

07:24.688 --> 07:26.287
I love you. Bye.

07:26.289 --> 07:28.106
How you doing?

07:28.108 --> 07:30.641
Ugh, this is
such a disaster.

07:30.643 --> 07:33.144
My parents had all
my relatives over.

07:33.146 --> 07:35.330
They got one of those
six-foot sandwiches,

07:35.332 --> 07:39.200
and got my brother
a day pass out of rehab and...

07:40.419 --> 07:41.669
...now he's missing

07:41.671 --> 07:44.255
and the sandwich
is missing, and...

07:44.257 --> 07:45.840
They're probably
in Mexico by now.

07:45.842 --> 07:48.426
So humiliating.

07:48.428 --> 07:50.178
You still got the part.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.180
That's a huge
accomplishment.

07:52.182 --> 07:53.664
Yeah, but this was
supposed to be my break, okay?

07:53.666 --> 07:54.849
People were gonna
see me in this show

07:54.851 --> 07:56.000
and it was gonna
lead to bigger things.

07:56.002 --> 07:57.385
More auditions,
more parts...

07:57.387 --> 07:59.504
Now none of that's
gonna happen.

07:59.506 --> 08:00.638
Honey, you only had,
like, three lines.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.006
That wasn't gonna
happen anyway.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.563
Unbelievable.
Oh...

08:08.565 --> 08:10.732
Come on... no,
that's not what I meant.

08:10.734 --> 08:11.983
Then what did you mean?
I don't...

08:11.985 --> 08:13.151
Look, you know, words don't

08:13.153 --> 08:15.370
always have to mean things.

08:15.372 --> 08:17.038
I think you meant

08:17.040 --> 08:18.406
that you don't believe in me.
Nope.

08:18.408 --> 08:21.459
Uh-uh... I might not
know what I-I meant,

08:21.461 --> 08:23.378
but I know that
I didn't mean that.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.663
Not this guy.
Oh, no way.

08:25.665 --> 08:27.315
I want you, right now,

08:27.317 --> 08:29.584
to give me your 100% honest opinion.
Right.

08:29.586 --> 08:31.636
Do you think I have
what it takes

08:31.638 --> 08:33.371
to really make it
as an actress?

08:33.373 --> 08:35.256
Yes.
So you think I'll be on TV

08:35.258 --> 08:36.890
and in movies
and win awards.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.809
Honestly?
Yes, honestly.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.912
I don't.

08:40.914 --> 08:43.681
How could you say that?

08:43.683 --> 08:44.849
I don't know...

08:44.851 --> 08:46.851
I got all confused when
you said "honestly".

08:46.853 --> 08:49.020
Oh!

08:50.406 --> 08:52.640
Look, do I think
that you are talented

08:52.642 --> 08:53.825
and that you are beautiful?

08:53.827 --> 08:55.243
Of course I do.

08:55.245 --> 08:57.662
But isn't Los Angeles
full of actresses

08:57.664 --> 08:58.997
who are just as talented,

08:58.999 --> 09:01.199
just as beautiful?

09:01.201 --> 09:03.701
All right, look...
we'll come back to that.

09:03.703 --> 09:05.236
No, please.
Don't stop, go on.

09:05.238 --> 09:06.588
Tell me how I'm
gonna be a waitress

09:06.590 --> 09:07.872
for the rest of my life.

09:07.874 --> 09:09.257
That is not what I said.

09:09.259 --> 09:11.676
Look, I think
you're really good.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.511
I truly do.

09:13.513 --> 09:14.913
But this is an
incredibly hard thing

09:14.914 --> 09:16.247
that you're shooting for.

09:16.249 --> 09:17.582
I mean, the odds

09:17.584 --> 09:19.634
of anyone becoming
a successful actor

09:19.636 --> 09:21.386
are like a million to one.

09:21.388 --> 09:23.588
Wow, thank you.

09:31.096 --> 09:34.449
Should've let Sheldon come.

09:40.901 --> 09:43.085
This is interesting.

09:43.087 --> 09:45.220
Apparently,
a key component

09:45.222 --> 09:46.739
in some forms of humor

09:46.741 --> 09:48.991
is the element of surprise.

09:48.993 --> 09:50.576
Well, that makes sense.

09:50.578 --> 09:52.061
The prefrontal cortex

09:52.063 --> 09:54.830
is responsible for
planning and anticipation,

09:54.832 --> 09:56.499
and patients with
brain lesions on their...

09:56.501 --> 09:59.118
Brain lesions!

10:03.874 --> 10:05.424
Sheldon, you scared me.

10:05.426 --> 10:06.626
That wasn't funny.

10:06.628 --> 10:08.410
Or maybe you have a stick

10:08.412 --> 10:09.929
up your prefrontal cortex.

10:11.965 --> 10:13.182
Okay, the notion that

10:13.184 --> 10:15.184
you can read a few
books and come up with

10:15.186 --> 10:17.853
a definitive theory
of comedy is absurd.

10:17.855 --> 10:19.272
I mean, humor is

10:19.274 --> 10:21.390
a complex neurological...

10:26.013 --> 10:27.780
Okay, that's pretty good.

10:27.782 --> 10:28.981
Excellent.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.491
How about her?

10:38.493 --> 10:39.792
No!

10:39.794 --> 10:41.443
No pretty girls!

10:41.445 --> 10:43.212
The point is to talk
to regular people

10:43.214 --> 10:44.830
and work our way up
to pretty girls.

10:44.832 --> 10:46.281
Fine.

10:46.283 --> 10:49.168
How about that old lady
with the walker?

10:50.470 --> 10:51.971
That depends.

10:51.973 --> 10:55.975
On any level,
do you think she's hot?

10:55.977 --> 10:58.177
We'll find somebody else.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.865
Kumquat?

11:04.801 --> 11:07.570
I guess.

11:08.805 --> 11:11.057
Ointment?

11:12.442 --> 11:14.777
Sure.

11:14.779 --> 11:17.413
Now, would you say
ointment

11:17.415 --> 11:22.301
is more, equal to,
or less funny than kumquat?

11:24.454 --> 11:27.957
I don't think I want
to go out with you anymore.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.875
Will you please
stop joking around?

11:29.877 --> 11:31.627
I'm trying to figure this out.

11:31.629 --> 11:34.597
Sheldon, how many words
are you gonna go through?

11:34.599 --> 11:36.732
All of them.

11:37.884 --> 11:40.603
You didn't get your part cut.

11:41.906 --> 11:43.439
All right, baby,
here's the deal.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.175
And you didn't get
your part cut.

11:47.378 --> 11:50.246
Yep, bunch of old guys
rocking out in a band,

11:50.248 --> 11:51.380
all with erectile dysfunction,

11:51.382 --> 11:52.915
you didn't get
your part cut!

11:56.920 --> 11:57.887
Hey.

11:57.889 --> 11:59.521
Can we talk?

11:59.523 --> 12:03.843
We can, but the part
of Penny might get cut.

12:04.961 --> 12:08.581
That was really
crappy of me.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.866
What you're trying
to do <i>is</i> hard,

12:10.868 --> 12:12.551
but people do make it,

12:12.553 --> 12:15.538
and I really do believe
you could be one of them.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.040
Thank you.

12:18.042 --> 12:19.091
And...

12:19.093 --> 12:22.311
to show you how much
I believe in you,

12:22.313 --> 12:25.097
I kind of got you an audition.

12:25.099 --> 12:26.816
Are you serious? For what?

12:26.818 --> 12:29.101
The new <i>Star Wars</i> movie.
What?!

12:29.103 --> 12:31.887
How did you manage that?!

12:31.889 --> 12:33.722
There's this thing online,
you put yourself on tape

12:33.724 --> 12:35.908
and just send it in--
anyone can do it.

12:37.411 --> 12:40.162
Come on Leonard,
this is just a PR stunt.

12:40.164 --> 12:43.449
So? Even if it is,
you have a huge advantage

12:43.451 --> 12:44.900
because you're
an actual actress.

12:44.902 --> 12:48.070
Most of the people doing this
are just weirdoes and nerds.

12:49.089 --> 12:52.508
Wolowitz sent his in
two days ago.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.743
Really, let it go.

12:54.745 --> 12:57.412
Look, maybe it
is a long shot,

12:57.414 --> 12:58.964
but sometimes
long shots happen.

12:58.966 --> 13:01.133
Luke Skywalker was
only given one chance

13:01.135 --> 13:02.468
to destroy the Death Star.

13:02.470 --> 13:05.254
He had to get a torpedo
into an exhaust port

13:05.256 --> 13:06.588
that was only
two meters wide,

13:06.590 --> 13:08.891
but with the help
of The Force, he...

13:08.893 --> 13:12.111
Wow, I can feel you
hating me right now.

13:14.047 --> 13:18.067
How about that lady
in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

13:18.069 --> 13:20.736
Yeah, she seems friendly
and easy to...

13:20.738 --> 13:22.604
Never mind, she's gone.

13:24.124 --> 13:28.277
Yeah, maybe talking
to people is too hard.

13:28.279 --> 13:30.629
We could go over to
that department store,

13:30.631 --> 13:32.948
practice on
the mannequins.

13:32.950 --> 13:33.983
I don't know.

13:33.985 --> 13:35.501
They're dressed
very stylishly.

13:35.503 --> 13:37.002
They're probably stuck-up.

13:39.289 --> 13:40.589
This is ridiculous.

13:40.591 --> 13:42.291
The next person
that walks by,

13:42.293 --> 13:45.261
no matter who it is,
they're the one.

13:48.582 --> 13:50.983
We're gonna die here.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.187
Hello.
Hey.

13:55.189 --> 13:56.471
Where's Sheldon?

13:56.473 --> 13:58.140
He's home trying to use science

13:58.142 --> 14:00.526
to determine the basis of humor.

14:00.528 --> 14:02.644
That's interesting.
It's exhausting.

14:02.646 --> 14:04.479
Do you have
any idea how hard it is

14:04.481 --> 14:06.615
to laugh at a knock-knock
joke that starts with,

14:06.617 --> 14:07.816
"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,

14:07.818 --> 14:10.336
knock-knock-knock, Amy,
knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

14:11.321 --> 14:13.038
If you want him to stop,

14:13.040 --> 14:15.424
sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.

14:15.426 --> 14:18.761
Fake a laugh?

14:18.763 --> 14:20.763
Do you ever do that with me?

14:20.765 --> 14:24.383
No, of course not.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.886
Well, I'd be able
to tell anyway.

14:26.888 --> 14:29.188
I don't think you would.

14:29.190 --> 14:31.840
Please, I've made
plenty of girls laugh,

14:31.842 --> 14:34.026
sometimes just by
asking them out.

15:06.309 --> 15:08.727
Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.

15:10.897 --> 15:14.984
Yes, how much for a hundred
long-stemmed red roses?

15:16.353 --> 15:18.587
Really?

15:18.589 --> 15:20.656
How much for three?

15:22.859 --> 15:23.826
Hey.

15:23.828 --> 15:25.661
Yeah, I'll call you back.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.065
Look, I know you were
just trying to help

15:30.067 --> 15:31.533
with your <i>Star Wars</i> thing.

15:31.535 --> 15:33.235
I didn't mean
to call it idiotic.

15:33.237 --> 15:35.671
Well, I don't think
you called it idiotic.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.672
Oh.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.607
Sorry, I meant to.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.380
Anyway, um, I was just upset
with myself.

15:44.382 --> 15:46.265
I wasn't mad at you.

15:47.384 --> 15:49.351
I just feel like everything
is falling apart.

15:49.353 --> 15:51.186
Come on. It's okay.

15:51.188 --> 15:53.222
No, it's not okay!
Look at me, okay?!

15:53.224 --> 15:55.724
I took a temp job
as a waitress forever ago,

15:55.726 --> 15:56.859
and I'm still doing it.

15:56.861 --> 15:58.527
I can't quit,
because guess what?

15:58.529 --> 16:00.595
I can't do anything else.

16:00.597 --> 16:03.399
And I finally get my big break,
and it goes away!

16:03.401 --> 16:04.533
I'm such a mess.

16:04.535 --> 16:06.268
No, you're not.
Really?!

16:06.270 --> 16:07.486
'Cause this morning
at Starbucks,

16:07.488 --> 16:10.789
a pair of old underwear
fell out of my pant leg!

16:12.909 --> 16:15.628
And it wasn't the only
one in there.

16:17.163 --> 16:20.966
Okay, listen to me,
this is just a minor setback.

16:20.968 --> 16:22.635
No, it's not, okay?!
I've been out here

16:22.637 --> 16:25.304
for, like, ten years!
I've nothing to show for it!

16:25.306 --> 16:27.389
Well, you have me.

16:28.224 --> 16:30.309
You're right.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.761
I do have you.

16:34.015 --> 16:35.597
Mm...

16:36.766 --> 16:38.517
Let's get married.

16:40.186 --> 16:41.520
What?

16:44.908 --> 16:47.026
Ooh!

16:47.028 --> 16:50.312
Leonard Hofstadter...

16:50.314 --> 16:51.697
will you marry me?

16:51.699 --> 16:54.783
Um...

16:55.818 --> 16:59.288
Did you seriously
just say, "Um"?!

17:00.540 --> 17:03.842
Look, you know I love you,

17:03.844 --> 17:07.496
but-but you're-you're drunk
and sad and feeling lost...

17:07.498 --> 17:10.432
Okay, so-so you don't
want to marry me?!

17:10.434 --> 17:11.800
That is not what I said.

17:11.801 --> 17:13.835
No, forget it! I take it back!
Offer's off the table!

17:13.837 --> 17:16.438
Who's in the mood to laugh?!

17:17.973 --> 17:20.008
Really not a good time.

17:20.010 --> 17:22.644
But I used science
to construct the perfect joke.

17:22.646 --> 17:24.346
I'm gonna go.
Penny, don't.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.898
No, no, I just need
to be alone.

17:29.903 --> 17:35.023
So, a sandwich, a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar.

17:35.025 --> 17:37.126
Where are you going?

17:37.128 --> 17:38.860
To my room.
Should I follow you?

17:38.862 --> 17:40.195
No.

17:40.197 --> 17:41.530
Leonard, wait.

17:41.532 --> 17:42.715
What?

17:42.717 --> 17:46.051
I forgot to tell you
the sandwich is promiscuous.

17:56.712 --> 17:59.148
How about those guys
on that bench over there?

17:59.150 --> 18:00.082
They look pathetic.

18:00.084 --> 18:02.618
I bet we could
talk to them.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.253
That's a mirror.

18:05.288 --> 18:07.689
Oh, yeah.

18:09.909 --> 18:11.910
Hey, fellas,
mall's closing.

18:11.912 --> 18:13.912
Sorry.
Yeah. Good night.

18:15.281 --> 18:16.615
Uh, excuse me.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.699
Yeah?

18:18.618 --> 18:22.571
Uh, do-do you like being
a mall security guard?

18:22.573 --> 18:25.007
It's all right.

18:25.009 --> 18:27.626
Okay, nice talking to you.

18:31.798 --> 18:35.300
Smooth...!

18:43.693 --> 18:45.260
Can't sleep?

18:45.262 --> 18:47.529
No.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.604
Would you like
to talk about it?

18:55.606 --> 18:59.224
Penny proposed,
and I didn't say yes.

19:00.794 --> 19:02.144
Why not?

19:04.214 --> 19:07.082
That's a good question.

19:08.384 --> 19:10.803
Does that mean the
relationship is over?

19:10.805 --> 19:13.839
I don't know.

19:13.841 --> 19:16.475
Why don't you ask her?

19:18.144 --> 19:22.481
Because I'm afraid
to know the answer.

19:26.803 --> 19:29.471
Well...

19:29.473 --> 19:30.689
I'm sorry.

19:32.559 --> 19:34.643
That's it?

19:34.645 --> 19:37.362
You're not gonna make
some dumb joke

19:37.364 --> 19:39.114
or some inappropriate comment?

19:39.116 --> 19:42.117
No.

19:42.119 --> 19:45.037
You're my friend, and...

19:45.039 --> 19:46.255
I'm sorry.

19:51.711 --> 19:55.497
Did you just put a "kick me"
sign on my back?

19:59.385 --> 20:02.004
No.

20:02.006 --> 20:04.806
That wouldn't be
funny at all.

20:20.473 --> 20:24.342
Star Wars audition, take one...

20:24.344 --> 20:28.863
starring Howard Joel Wolowitz,
real-life astronaut.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.219
Vader is here...

20:38.221 --> 20:41.038
now... on this moon.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.757
I felt his presence.

20:42.759 --> 20:44.592
He's come for me.

20:44.594 --> 20:46.227
He can feel when I'm near...

20:46.229 --> 20:47.272
How many times
do I have to tell you

20:47.273 --> 20:49.440
to replace the toilet paper
when it's empty?!

20:51.110 --> 20:53.544
I'm in the middle of something!
So am I!
