* We're going to Manehattan!
We're going to Manehattan! *

00:06.674 --> 00:08.742
We're going to Manehattan!

00:08.776 --> 00:10.644
Yes, yes. Manehattan.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.481
The height of sophistication,
elegance, culture.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.751
Since my boutique in Canterlot
has been doing so nicely,

00:17.785 --> 00:20.654
it only makes sense for me
to open one there as well.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.156
Eee! We're almost there!

00:22.190 --> 00:24.792
Why doesn't your face
look like this? Eee!

00:24.825 --> 00:28.229
Oh, Pinkie, dear. This is
just a business trip for me.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.464
I need to scour the city for
the most perfect location

00:30.498 --> 00:32.400
for my new shop.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.668
And while it's lovely
how excited you are,

00:34.702 --> 00:39.473
there's absolutely no chance
of me getting swept into the

00:39.507 --> 00:42.710
...energy, the
beauty, the majesty

00:42.743 --> 00:45.179
of the greatest city
in all of Equestria!

00:45.213 --> 00:47.315
* [majestic theme]

00:47.348 --> 00:50.818
This city is simply amazing!

00:50.851 --> 00:53.721
It's just... everything. Ever.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.557
And it's about to get
everything ever-er

00:56.590 --> 00:58.092
because guess who I see!

01:00.194 --> 01:04.132
M-A-U-D! You know
what that spells?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.733
It spells Maud.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.268
[poof!]

01:07.301 --> 01:09.837
MAUD-MAUD-MAUD! Yay!

01:14.908 --> 01:18.779
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:18.812 --> 01:20.748
* Aaaahhh

01:20.781 --> 01:22.816
* My little Pony

01:22.850 --> 01:25.419
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:25.453 --> 01:27.288
* My Little Pony

01:27.321 --> 01:29.690
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:29.723 --> 01:31.759
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:31.792 --> 01:34.162
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:34.162 --> 01:36.264
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:36.297 --> 01:38.266
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:38.299 --> 01:40.401
* To have my little pony

01:40.434 --> 01:44.705
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:50.744 --> 01:52.713
**

01:52.746 --> 01:54.748
Rarity: Oh, you Pie
sisters have just about

01:54.782 --> 01:57.185
the sweetest family
traditions.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.320
Every year you set
aside a special day

01:59.353 --> 02:01.289
to spend with each
of your sisters?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.491
Yep. I do separate
trips with each one.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.692
And we make it super-fun

02:04.725 --> 02:06.727
by picking a different
location every year.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.264
We see the sights all day and
then swap gifts at sunset.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.433
And since Maud's getting
her Rocktorate nearby,

02:12.466 --> 02:15.636
we figured this would be
the perfect spot for psssd.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.705
OK. What's the secret?

02:17.738 --> 02:18.772
Huh?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.541
You just said pssst!

02:20.574 --> 02:23.644
No, silly. Not pssst, psssd.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.679
P.S.S.S.D.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.581
Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day!

02:28.616 --> 02:30.251
[snort]

02:30.284 --> 02:32.220
[giggle]

02:32.220 --> 02:33.287
Maud?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.890
Boulder promised his
cousin a postcard.

02:39.260 --> 02:43.531
Well, I'll just leave
you two to your PSSSD.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.666
And now I am off to
scout possible locations

02:45.699 --> 02:47.268
for my new boutique.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.337
Before you go, can I ask
you a quick question?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.771
Oh, of course.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.940
Will you please help me?

02:54.842 --> 02:58.579
Only if you let go of
my leg and stand up.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.882
Every year Maud's PSSSD gift
always blows mine away.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.817
But this year is
going to be different.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.953
For the first time, I'm
finally getting her a gift

03:05.986 --> 03:08.656
that's as good as the
ones she always gets me.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.458
There's a specialty
store here in Manehattan

03:10.491 --> 03:12.560
that sells nothing
but rock pouches.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.595
A rock pouch would be
perfect for Boulder

03:14.628 --> 03:16.697
and I know Maude
will love it!

03:16.730 --> 03:19.900
Why, Pinkie. That really is
the perfect gift for Maud!

03:19.933 --> 03:21.535
I know, right?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.737
The problem is, I
still need to buy one

03:23.771 --> 03:25.839
and the store's downtown.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.776
Hmm and you want to
get a pouch for Maud,

03:28.809 --> 03:31.712
without ruining the surprise.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.748
Well, luckily for you, I know
exactly what you should do.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.484
Why not sight-see
in a path that leads

03:36.517 --> 03:37.885
right to the pouch store?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.920
That way, Maud won't
get suspicious.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.790
I'll come with you and
distract Maud so --

03:42.823 --> 03:45.526
I can sneak away to
pick out a rock pouch.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.860
And if you're
coming with us,

03:46.894 --> 03:49.363
you can look at boutique
locations along the way!

03:49.397 --> 03:53.334
It's the perfect plan! [echo:
Perfect plan! Perfect plan!]

03:54.868 --> 03:57.505
Yes, yes, yes. Let's
not get too excited

03:57.538 --> 03:59.740
until you actually
get a pouch for Maud.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.843
Of course. Got it.
Absolutely.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.446
Nothing moved him.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.648
Maud, I'm giving you
the greatest PSSSD gift

04:07.681 --> 04:08.916
in the history of ever!

04:10.551 --> 04:12.553
[poof!]

04:12.586 --> 04:17.024
**

04:17.057 --> 04:19.727
Rarity: What a spectacular view!

04:19.760 --> 04:22.330
You really can see
everything from here.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.065
Especially the glaciation
of the sloping strata.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.767
It's breathtaking.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.371
But not half as breathtaking
as the gift I'm giving you.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.439
[poof!]

04:32.506 --> 04:36.510
**

04:36.544 --> 04:40.481
It certainly is... "cozy",
but this simply won't do.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.016
Working in a space this small
would make me lose my mind.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.952
Just like Maud's
going to lose her mind

04:44.985 --> 04:46.587
when she sees the
gift I'm giving her!

04:48.456 --> 04:49.957
[poof]

04:49.990 --> 04:56.997
**

04:57.631 --> 04:59.733
Whatever you were about to
say isn't nearly as good

04:59.767 --> 05:01.369
as the gift I'm giving Maud!

05:01.369 --> 05:03.371
[poof]

05:03.371 --> 05:05.573
You'll be pleased
with yours, too.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.783
Pinkie, put down that crayon.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.085
The Cantering Cook isn't
that kind of restaurant!

05:19.753 --> 05:23.891
Oh, a pony could get used to
eating at places like this.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.527
I know. It's the only
restaurant in the city

05:26.560 --> 05:29.697
with nepheline syenite
in their bathroom tiles.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.901
[nervous laugh] Well,
isn't that something.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.069
You know what, Pinkie Pie?

05:36.103 --> 05:40.508
Uh, maybe you could help me
figure out what to order.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.875
We're so close to
the pouch store!

05:41.909 --> 05:43.477
It's just a block away!

05:43.511 --> 05:45.546
I could practically
smell it from here...

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
if I knew what a pouch
store smelled like!

05:48.916 --> 05:50.751
OK, remember the plan:

05:50.784 --> 05:53.454
I will stay here and distract
Maud while you go get a pouch.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.888
Gotcha!

05:54.922 --> 05:58.826
Oh, why thank you for the
kind assistance, Pinkie Pie.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.595
And now I know
exactly what to order.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.897
You are very welcome, Rarity.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.934
Now pardon me whilst
I go wash my hooves.

06:06.967 --> 06:07.968
[crash]

06:08.001 --> 06:09.069
Sorry!

06:10.704 --> 06:12.440
So, Maud.

06:12.473 --> 06:17.945
That Boulder of yours is such
an interesting... character.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.615
You must tell me. How did
the two of you first meet?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.751
It was a dark and stormy night.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.754
Little did I know that my life
was about to change forever...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.762
Look at that hand-stitched
ten thousand-thread-count-

06:34.795 --> 06:38.466
velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud
will love it! I NEED it!

06:40.768 --> 06:42.035
Huh. Must be stuck.

06:43.671 --> 06:47.074
"Took a sudden vacation to
Canterlot with my grand-niece.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.543
Back in a few moons."

06:49.577 --> 06:53.146
Oh, no. Oh no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

06:53.180 --> 06:56.684
Well, maybe, just maybe, he's
already back from vacation

06:56.717 --> 06:59.520
and just forgot to
take the sign down.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.189
Hello, Mr. Pouch Store Owner!

07:02.222 --> 07:04.191
I'd love to hear all
about your sudden vacation

07:04.224 --> 07:05.726
to Canterlot with
your grand-niece

07:05.759 --> 07:07.728
while buying a pouch
for my sister, please!

07:07.761 --> 07:09.129
[smashing]

07:09.162 --> 07:11.665
Miss? The store's
clearly closed.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.867
But it can't be!
It just can't be!

07:13.901 --> 07:15.569
If I can't get that pouch,

07:15.603 --> 07:17.971
then not only am I not getting
my sister the greatest present

07:18.005 --> 07:20.007
in the history of PSSSD,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.943
but now I have no PSSSD
present for my sister at all!

07:28.181 --> 07:31.218
And Boulder's been by
my side ever since.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.621
Wow. What a surprisingly
suspenseful

07:33.654 --> 07:35.122
and compelling story.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.058
I completely get what
you see in him now.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.128
Pinkie Pie! You're back!

07:41.161 --> 07:44.565
Oh, your hooves must
be sparkling clean.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.233
Huh? Oh, right.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.568
[groan]

07:49.102 --> 07:51.204
GarÃ§on, one Super-Deluxe
Two Mile High

07:51.238 --> 07:52.840
Hot Fudge Sundae, STAT!

07:55.042 --> 07:56.777
[crash]

07:56.810 --> 07:58.679
What happened? Did you
get a pouch for Maud?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.213
Tell me everything!

08:00.247 --> 08:02.750
The door to the rock
pouch store was locked

08:02.783 --> 08:04.952
because the owner's on a
sudden vacation to Canterlot

08:04.985 --> 08:06.887
with his grand-niece
for a few moons

08:06.920 --> 08:09.790
and so there's no way I
can get the perfect present

08:09.823 --> 08:13.126
for Maud and now I don't have
any present for her at all

08:13.160 --> 08:15.896
so it'll be the worst Pie
Sister Surprise Swap Day ever!

08:15.929 --> 08:19.199
[blubbering]

08:19.232 --> 08:21.268
Oh not to worry, dear.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.071
I'll just have to help you
find a new present for Maud.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.940
We have plenty of time before
your gift exchange at sunset

08:26.974 --> 08:29.042
and all of Manehattan
to explore.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.944
We're bound to find
something Maud would like.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.746
Maybe even more
than a rock pouch!

08:34.047 --> 08:36.249
You're right! Thanks, Rarity!

08:36.283 --> 08:43.156
* [piano notes]

08:43.190 --> 08:45.759
Maud, I can't help
but notice you're staring

08:45.793 --> 08:47.695
at that marvelous giraffe.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.062
I was just wondering,

08:49.096 --> 08:52.265
any chance you could
see yourself with it?

08:52.299 --> 08:53.867
Only if I had a mirror.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.740
Now Maud, I know you're
a big fan of rocks,

08:59.773 --> 09:01.341
so get your camera ready

09:01.374 --> 09:03.844
because these are the
most spectacular rocks

09:03.877 --> 09:05.746
in all of Manehattan.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.848
Surely there must be something
here that catches your eye.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.620
Boulder says they're
all too "stuck up".

09:17.691 --> 09:19.159
[whistle]

09:19.192 --> 09:22.095
All right. You and me, Maud.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.664
You and me.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.636
What do you think about this?

09:28.636 --> 09:32.706
Or this? Or this? Or this?
O this? Or this? Or this?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.074
This? This? This?

09:34.107 --> 09:39.112
This-this-this-this-this
-this-th is-this-

09:39.146 --> 09:41.882
I like that.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.751
What is it? You have to tell me!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.653
Was it this bike? This
lamp? This grappling hook?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.087
What do you like?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.723
I like that fissure
in the sidewalk.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.725
It's an elegant example
of thermal expansion

09:51.759 --> 09:52.993
and soil settlement.

09:56.864 --> 10:01.869
[mumbling] WHAT!?

10:01.902 --> 10:05.372
But I... all of this...
and she likes a crack?!

10:07.074 --> 10:09.042
Did she like anything?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.945
That sister of yours is simply
impossible to shop for.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.147
There's nothing
she needs or wants.

10:14.181 --> 10:21.054
Boulder? Boulder?
Where'd you run off to?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.056
There you are.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.659
Sure wish I had something
to carry you around in.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.297
A rock pouch was a
perfect gift for Maud!

10:30.330 --> 10:32.900
And I know she would
have loved the one I saw

10:32.933 --> 10:36.704
in the window! It had double
stitching, a red drawstring--

10:36.737 --> 10:38.706
--and ochre-flecked
velvet lining

10:38.739 --> 10:41.174
with reinforced triple
crosshatched seams?

10:41.208 --> 10:45.178
Yep. That's the pouch.
Wait. How'd you know?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.980
Because I'm looking
at one just like it.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.419
Maybe if you catch up
with him, you could ask-

10:54.487 --> 10:56.056
Excuse me, Sir.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.826
I couldn't help but notice
your nifty rock pouch.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.161
Is there any chance you'd
be willing to part with it?

11:01.194 --> 11:05.265
I really need it. Like,
really, really, REALLY!

11:05.298 --> 11:07.735
So lemme get this straight.

11:07.768 --> 11:11.404
You really, really
need this pouch, huh?

11:11.438 --> 11:15.008
I believe I said,
really, really, REALLY!

11:15.042 --> 11:17.911
Well, you know
pouches like this

11:17.945 --> 11:21.014
are really hard to
come by these days.

11:21.048 --> 11:25.118
But I might be able to part
with it for the right price.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.486
So you'll sell it to me?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.756
And I'll finally be
able to give my sister

11:28.756 --> 11:30.824
the perfect Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day present?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.993
Ooh, thank you, thank
you, thank you!

11:33.026 --> 11:36.096
[poof!]

11:36.129 --> 11:42.235
Hmmmmm. That's one sweet
party cannon you got there.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.772
Tell you what. I'd be more
than happy to give you

11:44.772 --> 11:48.108
the pouch for the low, low
price of... that cannon.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.046
My, my party cannon?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.515
Well, if you really want to
give that sister of yours

11:55.548 --> 11:57.417
the perfect present,

11:57.450 --> 12:00.487
then you'll have to give
up your party cannon.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.958
So what do you say? The
pouch for the cannon.

12:11.531 --> 12:15.035
Do you see the exposed
chalcedony in the fissure?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.303
Probably?

12:16.336 --> 12:17.871
Whatcha guys looking at?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.506
Oh, you're back.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.075
Darling, I want to get
one more picture of you

12:22.109 --> 12:24.477
and that astounding
fissure in the sidewalk.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.246
And the inspiration
just struck me

12:26.279 --> 12:28.048
for the perfect shot!

12:28.081 --> 12:30.450
Be a dear and go
stand behind it.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.488
OK, now just back
up a little bit.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.826
Little more.

12:40.861 --> 12:45.265
And now just a little...
twenty yards more.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.868
Perfect! Hold that pose!

12:47.901 --> 12:51.238
I think we found your
new holiday card!

12:51.271 --> 12:54.007
So, how did it go? Tell
me, tell me, tell me!

12:54.041 --> 12:57.277
Well, I got the
rock pouch for Maud.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.379
That's really the only
thing that matters.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.982
Oh, I am so glad
to hear that!

13:02.015 --> 13:04.284
She's going to
absolutely LOVE it.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.452
Yep.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.421
Yep? That's it?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.024
You got your sister the
greatest PSSSD present

13:11.058 --> 13:12.259
in the history of ever

13:12.292 --> 13:14.895
and all you have
to say is 'yep'?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.463
Yep.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.099
But you're Pinkie Pie.
You're supposed to be all--

13:19.132 --> 13:21.001
I'm so excited I
got the rock pouch!

13:21.034 --> 13:22.903
And I know I say
'excited' a lot

13:22.936 --> 13:25.072
when I'm actually just kind
of excited, but this time

13:25.105 --> 13:27.174
I'm really excited about how
excited I am about being

13:27.207 --> 13:28.575
this excited over
the rock pouch!

13:28.608 --> 13:30.577
And then you fire off
your party cannon.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.180
Say, where is your cannon?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.082
[gasp] Did you lose it?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.617
Is your party cannon lost
somewhere in the big city?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.320
Well, I wouldn't say it's lost.

13:40.353 --> 13:44.324
I mean, I know where it
is, it's just... [sigh]

13:44.357 --> 13:46.559
I can clearly see that
something's bothering you

13:46.593 --> 13:48.996
and I want to help.
But I can't help you

13:49.029 --> 13:51.431
unless you tell me
what the problem is.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.901
Oh there's no problem.
It just turns out

13:53.934 --> 13:56.003
that the going rate for a
rock pouch in Manehattan

13:56.036 --> 13:59.239
is one party cannon. Who knew?

13:59.272 --> 14:01.608
YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR CANNON?

14:01.641 --> 14:04.444
B-but that party cannon
is your everything!

14:04.477 --> 14:06.079
You absolutely
love that cannon.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.514
How could you possibly
part with something

14:07.547 --> 14:09.316
that means so much to you?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.351
Well, I finally got Maud a gift

14:11.384 --> 14:14.154
that's just as good as the
ones she always gets me.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.124
And that's all that
really matters.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.127
Well, I guess I
understand. Maybe?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.095
Maud's going to be so excited.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.231
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

14:24.264 --> 14:26.934
when she sees the pouch!

14:26.934 --> 14:29.970
I know. The camera
loves Boulder.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.941
After the day we've had,

14:33.974 --> 14:35.976
I'm probably looking
forward to the "swap" part

14:36.009 --> 14:37.444
of the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day

14:37.477 --> 14:39.446
even more than the
two of you!

14:39.479 --> 14:42.049
And I'm not even
a Pie sister!

14:42.082 --> 14:44.084
I can't wait one
more second to see

14:44.117 --> 14:46.153
the wonderful gifts
you've gotten each other.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.522
Well, you're going have to.
We don't just swap, silly.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.093
We always sing the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day Song first.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.294
Ready, Maud?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.329
As I'll ever be.

14:56.363 --> 15:00.133
* It's the Pie Sister
Swap Day Song! *

15:00.167 --> 15:02.169
Hey.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.636
OK. Time to swap presents!

15:06.006 --> 15:07.274
Hmmmmm.

15:07.307 --> 15:14.314
* [music intensifying]

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
Just open them already!

15:24.591 --> 15:25.993
Thanks.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.227
I knew you'd love it!

15:27.260 --> 15:31.564
It was all worth it!
Look how happy she is!

15:31.598 --> 15:33.466
And I couldn't have
done it without you.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.335
Thank you, Rarity.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.038
OK, time to open
your present to me!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.675
Uh! You did it again!

15:42.709 --> 15:46.413
You got me the best present
in the history of PSSSD!

15:46.446 --> 15:49.349
This is perfect. This is
amazing. This is incredible!

15:49.382 --> 15:52.185
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

15:52.219 --> 15:54.187
What is it?

15:54.221 --> 15:56.689
It's little pieces of
cupcake-scented paper.

15:56.723 --> 16:01.228
You know. Confetti.
For your cannon.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.696
Maud, you know me so well.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.498
You really are the most
thoughtful gift-giver

16:05.532 --> 16:07.100
in the world.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.636
I'm going to love it five-ever.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.604
That's even longer than forever.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.145
You're right.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.580
That is impressive, but it's
no fissure in the sidewalk.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.351
Play nice.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.087
Oh, I'm so relieved to see that
you like the pouch. Especially

16:27.120 --> 16:29.156
considering what Pinkie
Pie had to give up for it.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.157
[gasp]

16:30.190 --> 16:31.458
What?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.193
I mean, forget I said that.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.163
I'm-I'm glad to
see you like pouch.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.366
You can remember that part.
Just forget the second part.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.501
You know, the second part
where I said Pinkie Pie

16:41.534 --> 16:43.603
had to give something
up for it. [gasp]

16:43.636 --> 16:46.073
I should just stop
talking now. Nothing!

16:46.106 --> 16:47.607
Hee-hee! Yay!

16:47.640 --> 16:51.211
I love my sister
and my new confetti!

16:51.244 --> 16:53.613
Why isn't she using
her party cannon?

16:53.646 --> 16:54.781
Uh.

16:58.351 --> 17:02.222
Ooh wow, look how
filthy my hooves are.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.790
I really should go
wash them.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.560
Where's her cannon?

17:07.594 --> 17:12.832
No, no stop giving me that
look! I can't take it.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.568
Pinkie Pie feels badly that
the gifts she always gives you

17:15.602 --> 17:17.637
are never as good as
the ones you give her.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.206
What?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.773
That's why she was
willing to give up

17:20.807 --> 17:23.210
her party cannon
for the pouch.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.811
She gave up her party cannon?

17:28.348 --> 17:33.653
Pinkie Pie? You might want to
come over here for a second.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.256
I think I know
what this is about.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.358
You guys want to
ride the swans.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.193
Well, they're swan boats,

17:40.227 --> 17:42.762
but there are real
swans here we can ride.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.531
You gave away your
party cannon?

17:46.833 --> 17:49.869
She broke me.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.706
It's just... it's just...

17:53.740 --> 17:56.143
You always give
better gifts than me!

17:56.176 --> 17:58.545
That's why I had to get
you the perfect gift.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.352
Are your hooves
dirty? Where ya going?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.420
To get your cannon back.

18:07.454 --> 18:14.461
**

18:15.495 --> 18:17.430
There.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.600
Yep. That sure is the
pony I got the pouch from.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.503
That's amazing! How did
you know where he'd be?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.505
Maud sense.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.174
Runs in the family.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.844
I'd like to
return this pouch

18:31.878 --> 18:34.314
for my sister's
party cannon, please.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.184
Sorry, missy. All
sales are final.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.751
I'd like to
return this pouch

18:38.785 --> 18:42.689
for my sister's
party cannon, please.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.524
I've never seen
her like this.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.726
Look at the fire
in her eyes.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.561
You better do
what she says.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.697
Fire in her eyes?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.432
Oh, did she just
clench her jaw?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.900
I think she
clenched her jaw.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.503
I didn't see.

18:56.536 --> 19:01.574
Oh, no. When she clenches her
jaw, you know what that means?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.476
What? What's it mean?

19:03.510 --> 19:06.946
Trust me; you do
not want to know.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.948
I'd like to return
this pouch.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.850
[frightened whimpers]

19:10.883 --> 19:13.353
Here! Take it!
Take it! Please!

19:13.386 --> 19:15.222
Just relax that
jaw of yours!

19:15.255 --> 19:17.357
And turn down that
fire in your eyes!

19:17.390 --> 19:19.326
[whimpers]

19:23.696 --> 19:26.533
Maud, I'm so happy you got
me my party cannon back! Yay!

19:26.566 --> 19:27.867
[poof]

19:27.900 --> 19:30.737
Uh-oh. I just
realized something.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.772
Because you gave back
the pouch for my cannon,

19:32.805 --> 19:35.475
this is now the second gift
you've gotten me today!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.245
And it's something I
really, really wanted!

19:38.245 --> 19:41.414
You did it again! Your gifts
are always better than mine!

19:41.448 --> 19:43.950
Next year, I'm going to have
to really step it up and-

19:43.983 --> 19:47.487
Pinkie, gift-giving
isn't a competition.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.921
It's an expression
of love.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.823
And you always make
sure to give your gifts

19:50.857 --> 19:52.725
with lots of love.

19:52.759 --> 19:56.863
That's why I'll always love
them and you, five-ever.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.332
That's even longer
than forever.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.538
There you are. You've sure
been washing your hooves

20:05.572 --> 20:08.775
for a long time. We've
got a train to catch here.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.311
I know, but there
is one more sight

20:11.344 --> 20:13.513
you two simply must
see before we leave.

20:13.546 --> 20:19.719
**

20:19.752 --> 20:24.824
Voila! Welcome to the future
home of "Rarity For You."

20:24.857 --> 20:26.593
What do you think
of the place?

20:26.626 --> 20:29.028
Is this the right location?
Did I pick a good spot?

20:29.061 --> 20:33.933
No. You picked the perfect spot.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.837
You know, I think this might
be my favorite PSSSD ever!

20:37.870 --> 20:41.574
But I can't wait until
next year's PSSSDWR.

20:41.608 --> 20:45.445
Wait. PSSSDWR? What's that?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.747
P.S.S.S.D.W.R.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.283
It's a new tradition that
Maud and I came up with

20:50.317 --> 20:52.719
Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day-

20:52.752 --> 20:54.287
-With Rarity.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.490
Ooh! Why, that's the sweetest...

20:57.524 --> 20:59.959
Oh, no. No, no, no!

20:59.992 --> 21:02.795
I know how good you two
are at giving gifts.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.997
I'm going to have to get
you both something amazing.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.767
And I only have a
year to do it!

21:07.800 --> 21:10.437
Oh Rarity, it doesn't
matter what you get us.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.673
As long as you give your gift
with love, it'll be perfect.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.413
Ah. Why thank you, Pinkie.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.516
But, now that you mention it,

21:23.550 --> 21:25.852
I could use more confetti
for my party cannon.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.687
You wouldn't believe
how much of that stuff

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
I go through in a day.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.357
Poof!
