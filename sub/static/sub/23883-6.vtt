WEBVTT

00:38.580 --> 00:40.749
I remember when we first came to Tokyo,

00:40.832 --> 00:42.500
you took me to Lawson's
and we bought a bunch of foods.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.669
-It's one of my favorite things to eat.
It's amazing.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.090
-Wareheim.
-Oh!

00:49.174 --> 00:50.258
-Hey!

00:50.341 --> 00:52.385
-Just browsing.
Fair enough.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.928
Well, you wanna grab
some tasty bites with us?

00:54.012 --> 00:54.846
Oh, I'd love to.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.185
It's like a milky, soda-y beverage.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.853
-I always liked the name.
-I'll try some Calpis.

01:01.936 --> 01:02.937
CALPIS
REFRESH &amp; HAPPY

01:03.021 --> 01:05.648
Calpis. Japanese number one citrus milk.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.444
The thing that I love the most
about a convenient mart like this

01:09.527 --> 01:10.570
-is this.
Wow!

01:10.653 --> 01:12.572
<i>Wow!</i>

01:12.655 --> 01:15.992
Wow! Do you get dippies
for any of these nuggies?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.118
Yeah, we need some dippies.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.290
Wow!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.337
It has a curry flavor.
Mmm-hmm.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.379
<i>Gee!</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:33.051
Really?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.428
It's a personal purchase for me.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.514
They put your magazine in its own bag.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.807
Separate bag.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.391
Thank you. I needed this.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.334

03:10.398 --> 03:12.191

03:12.275 --> 03:14.527
<i>Of all the animals that you could consume,</i>

03:14.611 --> 03:18.948
a chicken seems like it was, like,
brought into the world to be eaten.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.160
I've never put chicken in my mouth,
and said to myself,

03:22.243 --> 03:24.621
"This was a leap." You know? No.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.999
This was the bird that you were supposed
to have in the front yard and eat.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.835
You sound like you're paraphrasing
Ben Franklin.

03:30.919 --> 03:34.631
Chicken is proof that God loves us
and wants us to be happy.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.341
This restaurant we're in, Dooky Chase's,

03:36.424 --> 03:41.012
<i>has been the custodian of food</i>
<i>for New Orleans for how many years?</i>

03:41.095 --> 03:42.639
<i>Probably 70. </i>

03:42.722 --> 03:46.434
<i>This was the one place that black folks </i>
<i>could go for a kinda fancy meal.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:49.103
So this is where my father came
to celebrate getting out of law school.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.105
Fried chicken for you all.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.815
Oh, wow.
Speak of the devil.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.986
So we can agree it's delicious roasted,
it's delicious poached.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.657
Literally, every way you could
cook a chicken, it's delicious.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.950
-Right.
-But For me,

04:02.033 --> 04:03.910
fried chicken is something that is...

04:03.993 --> 04:07.830
I can't...
It's something I have to eat, you know?

04:07.914 --> 04:11.042
I think it's something that is universal,
it's approachable,

04:11.125 --> 04:13.336
it's quick, it's easy, it's inexpensive.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.504
Let's do it.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.882
I mean, you got fried chicken all over
the world. Korean fried chicken.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.551
Chinese literally have, like,
thousands of types.

04:20.635 --> 04:25.265
And even in American South,
there are all varieties.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.142
The other thing that's funny

04:28.226 --> 04:32.188
is seeing how relatively new traditions
become "traditions."

04:32.272 --> 04:34.482
Like Nashville hot chicken.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.402
It wasn't like people were doing that
50, 60 years ago.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.196
Like, a 20, 25-year-old tradition at best,
you know?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.407
The story behind that
is also very interesting,

04:42.490 --> 04:44.826
because it was the girlfriend
that was being spiteful

04:44.909 --> 04:47.203
-to the boyfriend at the time--

04:47.287 --> 04:49.080
-Yes.
Oh, you don't know the story?

04:49.163 --> 04:49.998
No.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.000
Brother comes home a little later
than he should've.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.211
His wife, his girlfriend decides
she gonna fix him.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.715
She's gonna make some fried chicken,
just put a whole lot of hot sauce on it.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.926
And it backfires, 'cause he likes it.
This becomes a tradition.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.313
<i>Fried chicken is such </i>
<i>an important thing in the South.</i>

05:14.439 --> 05:16.774
<i>It tells a story,</i>
<i>just like a lot of our food.</i>

05:16.858 --> 05:22.030
<i>What's neat about hot chicken is</i>
<i>there's so many different ways to do it. </i>

05:22.113 --> 05:24.449
<i>You can travel all over</i>
<i>and eat fried chicken</i>

05:24.532 --> 05:26.826
and get lots of different perspectives.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.494
And so this one is a collection

05:28.578 --> 05:31.831
of all my favorite fried chickens
I've ever had.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.294
This took about five years to develop
before we served it,

05:36.377 --> 05:38.671
'cause, you know,
we're a Southern restaurant.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.508
If we serve fried chicken that sucks,
you know how embarrassing that is? Like,

05:42.592 --> 05:43.676
you can't do that.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.138
-So, this has been in there overnight.
It's hydrated it.

05:47.221 --> 05:51.225
Yes, yes, yes.
So it's part of the chicken now.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.604
This chicken you could kick across
the damn parking lot

05:54.687 --> 05:57.607
-and the batter wouldn't come off.
-Again. Again.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.942
This is the dark arts.
This is sand baggery.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.071
You're not trying to crack it all
in there, right?

06:03.154 --> 06:04.989
Yeah. See those cracks and crevices?

06:05.073 --> 06:09.702
Those are your crunchies. See that?
That is gonna be insane.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.543
See, I literally just learned something.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.670
'Cause I've never seen fried chicken
with a cover on.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.089
That's old-school.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.383
You get those big cast iron chicken fryers
they call them. They come with a lid.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.386
Once I hear it going crazy
and I see the bubbles going crazy,

06:27.470 --> 06:30.807
I'm gonna take the lid off.
Because you don't want it to get soggy.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.393
Now we want all that water
to cook out and get crispy.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.064
I got inspired by all this hot chicken
here and, like,

06:38.147 --> 06:40.024
what an important part
of the culture.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.820
The thing that makes hot chicken
hot chicken is

06:43.903 --> 06:47.824
that they take the fat out of the pan
and mix it with cayenne,

06:47.907 --> 06:51.327
and roll the chicken in it.
So you're like frying in fat.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.622
That's not enough,
so we're gonna roll it in fat again,

06:54.705 --> 06:58.543
with spicy fat, and then hit it
with more spices, so that it...

06:58.626 --> 07:02.630
The spices stick. So I thought,
"Dude, that's awesome."

07:02.713 --> 07:07.760
So, we took a very similar... Oh!
Very similar approach.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.804
You would think that he would not
get so excited.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.265
Every time we've cooked,
this is what you do.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.892
How can you not
get pumped up about that?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.060
It never gets tired for you, man.

07:16.978 --> 07:23.901
This is chicken fat, bacon fat,
country ham, very aged country ham fat,

07:23.985 --> 07:26.737
butter and lard. So that's...

07:26.821 --> 07:28.656
This just looks Chinese to me now.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.618
Man, that is straight up. Look at that.
That's chili oil.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.831
Glaze it like that.

07:36.914 --> 07:41.794
This is like a secret mixture of vinegar,
hot sauce and a couple other...

07:41.878 --> 07:44.839
Things. Don't worry about it.
-Yeah, look at this.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.930
It has enough acidity
to balance out the fat.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.140
Mmm-hmm.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.518
-That's vinegar powder.
-That is really good.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.105
That is outrageous.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.815
Thanks.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.115
<i>Probably the number one variety </i>
<i>of fried chicken </i>

08:11.199 --> 08:13.451
<i>is fried chicken based from the South. </i>

08:13.534 --> 08:18.915
<i>Nashville hot chicken is a subset </i>
<i>of Southern fried chicken unto itself</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:21.584
<i>and that has, like, </i>
<i>spawned off all sorts of stuff. </i>

08:21.667 --> 08:24.045
<i>There's been a massive boom.</i>

08:24.128 --> 08:26.172
I mean, everybody got...

08:26.255 --> 08:29.091
If it's a burger place,
they're gonna have a hot chicken.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.469
It's crazy. Every restaurant in town

08:31.552 --> 08:33.971
has to have some sort of
hot chicken something.

08:34.055 --> 08:38.059
Whether it's a hot chicken pizza,
or a hot chicken taco,

08:38.142 --> 08:40.311
or a hot chicken pork bun.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.439
But we sort of are the ones
that put it on the map.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.610
I will take credit as Bolton's,
but we like the dry rub.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.738
-And that's what makes ours different.

08:50.821 --> 08:54.951
<i>The dry rub consists of love,</i>
<i>peace, joy and happiness.</i>

08:55.034 --> 08:57.662
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about what's gonna happen.</i>

08:57.745 --> 09:02.416
Truthfully, I've only had
the crazy-crazy hot here.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.378
-The hottest hottest can go.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.921
Didn't go so well?

09:07.004 --> 09:11.092
It was one of the worst, maybe the most
painful experience I've ever had.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.846
He says, "What is this hot chicken
I've been... I gotta check this out."

09:16.889 --> 09:19.433
<i>I come here. Knock on the door. </i>

09:20.226 --> 09:23.062
<i>I was like, "Give me the hottest.</i>
<i>I can handle anything."</i>

09:23.145 --> 09:24.272
<i>Oh!</i>

09:24.355 --> 09:28.401
<i>I have, like, one piece in front </i>
<i>of me and I eat it as fast as possible.</i>

09:28.484 --> 09:30.069
<i>Really?</i>

09:30.152 --> 09:32.613
<i>We get in this truck. </i>
<i>Something's happening.</i>

09:32.697 --> 09:35.199
<i>This is like, you know,</i>
<i>ayahuasca or something.</i>

09:35.283 --> 09:37.410
<i>I literally had an out-of-body experience.</i>

09:38.411 --> 09:41.831
<i>I open the door</i>
<i>and run out of the moving car.</i>

09:41.914 --> 09:46.127
<i>And I run into the gas station,</i>
<i>and I open up a bottle of chocolate milk </i>

09:46.210 --> 09:48.671
<i>and I start chugging it. </i>
<i>It's getting everywhere.</i>

09:48.754 --> 09:51.382
<i>And I'm like, </i>
<i>"I think I'm gonna literally explode."</i>

09:51.465 --> 09:52.675
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

09:52.758 --> 09:55.136
<i>I've never</i>
<i>felt this before in my life!</i>

09:56.596 --> 10:00.141
<i>All I know next is I'm rolling around</i>
<i>in the grass. </i>

10:00.933 --> 10:02.226
<i>I vomit.</i>

10:02.310 --> 10:03.811
<i>One of the ladies that was inside, </i>

10:03.894 --> 10:05.646
<i>she was just shaking her head at me </i>
<i>the entire time.</i>

10:05.730 --> 10:07.440
<i>Tried to tell him!</i>

10:07.523 --> 10:12.194
<i>Next thing I know, </i>
<i>I'm in his flatbed, biting on my belt.</i>

10:12.278 --> 10:15.656
<i>And I burst every blood vessel in my face.</i>

10:16.782 --> 10:20.494
<i>I don't recover </i>
<i>for another, like, eight, ten hours.</i>

10:22.580 --> 10:26.542
Oh, my God. Bless your heart.
-So, that's what happened.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.420
That's hilarious and awful
at the same time.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.672
-I want to try it again.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.301
But I want to eat your food
without eating like a lunatic.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.011
You want me to get you a knife and a fork

10:37.094 --> 10:39.597
and just let you slice off
a little bit at a time?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.932
Or you gonna go for it the way we eat it?

10:42.016 --> 10:44.226
-I want you to teach me how to eat it.
-Okay.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.232
One smoking hot. One medium.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.695
-Here it comes.
-Oh, beautiful.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.447
This is the way
we eat hot chicken.

10:56.530 --> 11:00.785
Pinch it. That way
you don't get pepper on your fingers.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.244
That is brilliant.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.413
So delicious!

11:04.497 --> 11:07.625
-It is delicious, but it hurts.
But we do it anyway.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.045
You're okay over there?

11:11.128 --> 11:14.340
You know what I've learned, too, with this
bread? It takes some of the heat away.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.466
I'm gonna help you out.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.553
Right when you register it's delicious,
you're like, "Oh."

11:19.637 --> 11:20.971
You're in a battle for your life.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.808
It gives you that rush.
It makes you want more.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.476
And I'm loving life right now.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.852
That's right.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.522
Bolton Matthews cooked it
and he spiced it.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.608
And I told him,
"Don't overdo it, have mercy today."

11:37.780 --> 11:40.908
Hey, there! When you hear KFC,
what pops into your mind?

11:46.247 --> 11:49.792
<i>Even though </i>
<i>the idea of cooking chicken in grease </i>

11:49.875 --> 11:52.002
<i>certainly cannot be </i>
<i>just one country's invention, </i>

11:52.086 --> 11:54.964
Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and even Chicken Licken,

11:55.047 --> 11:58.926
a chain I think is dead in the US,
but very much alive in South Africa.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.388
These places has helped inform
culinary tastes

12:02.471 --> 12:03.389
in other parts of the world.

12:05.307 --> 12:09.645
<i>I also like that this is something</i>
<i>we have in common and can enjoy.</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:19.738
<i>One of the best chefs in Tokyo,</i>
<i>one of the best chefs in the world</i>

12:19.822 --> 12:23.742
<i>has a dish that is inspired </i>
<i>by Kentucky Fried Chicken.</i>

12:23.826 --> 12:26.495
<i>Good things can happen </i>
<i>out of lowbrow things.</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:30.124
<i>I find Japanese</i>
<i>are excellent at frying. </i>

12:30.207 --> 12:31.834
<i>They're excellent at everything. </i>

12:31.917 --> 12:34.753
<i>I mean, for any skill you can imagine, </i>

12:34.837 --> 12:36.922
<i>it's just a matter of time </i>
<i>before some Japanese person</i>

12:37.006 --> 12:38.757
<i>gets obsessed with it and wants to do it</i>

12:38.841 --> 12:40.593
<i>and then they're gonna be </i>
<i>really good at it.</i>

12:40.676 --> 12:43.220
-Right.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.558
You were telling me, though,
that, like, you don't eat fried chicken.

12:47.641 --> 12:53.022
I do, but I'm pretty critical of it,
because of being from South Carolina.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.940
Is it that much better in South Carolina?

12:55.024 --> 12:58.360
There's a huge variance among something
that seems pretty simple.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.654
Tell me about growing up eating
in South Carolina.

13:00.738 --> 13:05.701
Probably had one of the most unique diets
of any person ever,

13:05.784 --> 13:09.622
because I would have
either Indian food or Southern food

13:09.705 --> 13:12.041
cooked by this one woman
that kind of took care of us

13:12.124 --> 13:14.668
most of the time we were growing up.
Her name was Miss Beulah.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.881
Black woman from South Carolina,
amazing cook.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.218
I grew up eating that
and then also my mom's Indian food.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.095
What about you?
Did you mainly just eat Korean food?

13:25.179 --> 13:27.723
Or was there American food
that you ate at home?

13:27.806 --> 13:30.518
My dad had a business
in Richmond, Virginia,

13:30.601 --> 13:32.311
so I'd go with him a lot.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.896
Plus I played in
lots of golf tournaments there. And I would eat all these, like...

13:35.564 --> 13:37.149
'Cause, like, once you get down
to Richmond,

13:37.233 --> 13:40.236
it's, like, the proper South, I think.
Beginning of.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.990
So I'd eat all these weird... At the time,
very weird Southern meals.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.701
Everything you grew up eating
was very foreign to me.

13:48.285 --> 13:53.082
And I was probably, like, eight or nine,
ten years old when this was happening,

13:53.165 --> 13:55.626
so that, like,
left a huge impression on me, so...

13:57.253 --> 13:58.295
What?

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
What?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.507
Do you know Kentucky Fried Chicken?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.591
<i>-Hai!</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:04.176
For you. Very special.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.848
This is pretty amazing.

14:11.517 --> 14:15.187
Take one of me holding mine.
That's such a funny idea.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.442
Wait. Why does it look like this

14:21.610 --> 14:22.903
Mmm!

14:22.987 --> 14:24.154
It's so good.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.533
-It's really taking me back to that...

14:27.616 --> 14:30.160
Miss Beulah's fried chicken
with, like, rice and gravy.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.704
You love KFC?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.331
When I eat it, I think it's good.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.504
Rice and Japanese plum is put in here.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.173
Japanese plum I put with rice a lot.

14:44.049 --> 14:48.095
It's sticky rice
seasoned with shiso and black sesame.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.432
And you stitch it up with the toothpick. Weirdly seems like something
Kentucky Fried Chicken would do.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.769
"We put the rice in the chicken."

14:56.896 --> 14:59.773
Chef, what is it about
America and fried chicken

14:59.857 --> 15:01.650
that you gravitate towards?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.652
Japanese people love KFC.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.821
All Japanese people eat KFC at Christmas.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.824
When they think of KFC,
they think of Christmas.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.200
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>That's the association.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:13.954
Do your customers get upset when...
That you mess with tradition?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.748
At the beginning,
there was a bit of that, yeah.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.917
But now, everyone loves it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.461
I mean, I love tradition.

15:20.544 --> 15:24.006
But, if you just keep doing it that way,
they won't really like Japanese cuisine,

15:24.089 --> 15:26.759
so it's about making that
a little more fun, and making it good.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.350
<i>KFC's amazing in Asia.</i>

15:34.433 --> 15:35.726
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

15:35.809 --> 15:37.227
<i>And it's a little bit Asian,</i>

15:37.311 --> 15:39.939
<i>but for the most part, they're eating</i>
<i>Colonel's original recipe.</i>

15:40.689 --> 15:43.025
The reason why KFC
crushes it in China

15:43.108 --> 15:45.694
is that they need to have
a hamburger explained to them.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.447
When they see a bucket of fried chicken...

15:49.448 --> 15:51.241
-That's Chinese food. It's communal.
Right.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.451
You're back to my point

15:52.534 --> 15:54.495
about seeing the bird in the yard
and going, "That's food."

15:54.578 --> 15:55.412
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:55.496 --> 15:59.708
From the moment we started
walking upright, the chicken was doomed.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.170
<i>Check. Check. </i>
<i>One, two. One, two. Check.</i>

16:03.253 --> 16:04.880
<i>I've known Dave for a few years now.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:07.549
Uh, this is rare,
but I'm gonna compliment him right now.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.760
Like, to me, he's actually an artist.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.892
I mean, the guy is fucking... He thinks
he's fucking right about everything.

16:16.976 --> 16:21.397
<i>I don't know how you guys deal with him.</i>
<i>I mean, he's just arguing with everyone.</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:23.857
<i>He's a table thumper.</i>

16:25.192 --> 16:28.487
He has so many, like,
strong opinions about everything.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.406
Sometimes he's right.
Most of the time, he's not.

16:30.489 --> 16:34.451
I don't know, we got into a crazy
fried chicken argument last night

16:34.535 --> 16:38.622
and now we're gonna test to see whose
fast-food fried chicken place is better.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.708
<i>We're going to this Chinese place </i>
<i>called Dico's.</i>

16:40.791 --> 16:43.085
<i>It's actually right across from KFC.</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:45.796
It's seafood and pork.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.215
Seafood?
Seafood and pork.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.968
Let me get three of those.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.469
Yeah. But can you put it in the bucket?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.347
You don't even fuckin' know
what's about to happen.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.766
You want some chicken?

16:58.392 --> 17:00.185
You want chicken?
Dicos?

17:02.771 --> 17:05.649
Do you like this chicken

17:09.862 --> 17:11.905
I'm not as friendly as Choe.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.867
You want chicken

17:16.368 --> 17:17.745
<i>They have so much stuff </i>
<i>on the menu</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:19.246
<i>that they don't have in America.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:20.664
What the fuck is that?

17:20.748 --> 17:23.459
Seafood fried in, like, hot Cheeto dust.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.670
I'm definitely not gonna eat that.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.755
It's no good.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.716
Look at that.
Whole wheat bun with oatmeal on it.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.886
I mean, we don't really need to do this.
I could already tell that KFC's better.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.055
<i>We don't support this.</i>
<i>I just think it's interesting.</i>

17:36.138 --> 17:39.475
I just know that people in China love KFC.
They're everywhere.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.644
<i>I want you to try this.</i>
<i>This is a revelation.</i>

17:43.395 --> 17:44.730
-Whoa!

17:45.731 --> 17:48.233
Maybe the best
commercially-made fried chicken.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.527
-That's so fucking good, man.
-It's Szechuan.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.779
It's, like, making your tongue numb.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.197
-Amazing. Amazing.

17:55.491 --> 17:59.369
Is it true that Chinese people
love chicken and watermelon?

17:59.453 --> 18:02.247
-Yeah.
That's what I heard.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.044
<i>I was in Mississippi.</i>

18:07.669 --> 18:09.379
I was in Mississippi doing a show

18:09.463 --> 18:12.341
and I go to a restaurant
to order some food,

18:12.424 --> 18:16.345
and I say to the guy,
I say, "I would like to have..."

18:16.428 --> 18:19.807
And before I even finish my sentence,
he says, "The chicken."

18:19.890 --> 18:21.767
"

18:23.227 --> 18:26.647
Remember Chappelle's angst
when he shut down his show?

18:26.730 --> 18:31.401
You know, if you're doing that work of
addressing these culturally iconic things,

18:31.485 --> 18:34.988
things that can either veer into authentic
and stereotype in a moment's notice,

18:35.072 --> 18:38.158
and go from one to the other
without you noticing it?

18:38.242 --> 18:43.288
There's that moment
where he's using humor to critique racism.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.833
Do you know what you'd like
for your in

18:45.916 --> 18:47.334
What are you serving?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.670
Oh, we have fish or chicken.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.509
I just heard the magic word. Chicken.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.679
Order you a big bucket, nigga,
and take a bite.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.139
You black motherfucker.

19:01.849 --> 19:05.602
He's doing a character
that is overtly stereotypic,

19:05.686 --> 19:09.398
trying to make a point.
And he sees what may or may not be,

19:09.481 --> 19:11.400
'cause there's no way to know
what's in the guy's head,

19:11.483 --> 19:13.443
a white guy laughing a little too hard.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.155
And at that moment,
he's like, "What am I doing?"

19:16.238 --> 19:20.159
And it's that precise moment
of vulnerability,

19:20.242 --> 19:23.412
it's like, if you want to walk
to that fence and deal with it,

19:23.495 --> 19:24.830
then you gotta be on the fence.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.957
Mmm-hmm.
-Fried chicken is kind of on that fence.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.333
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.253
In terms of
its socio

19:31.336 --> 19:34.882
Can you take the cultural history
of fried chicken out of it?

19:34.965 --> 19:36.717
'Cause most of the world
doesn't even know it.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.886
-Doesn't know, yeah.
That's true.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.680
When I first moved to the States,
I made a dish.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.724
I did fried chicken and watermelon,

19:43.807 --> 19:46.226
and my husband is like,
"You cannot do that."

19:46.310 --> 19:48.187
He was like, "That is the most
racist thing you can do."

19:48.270 --> 19:50.522
And for me,
I didn't think it was offensive.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.857
It's one of those foods

19:51.940 --> 19:54.526
that has sort of stereotypically
been associated with us.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.779
Black people during slavery
were allowed to keep chickens

19:57.863 --> 19:59.740
when you couldn't keep cows and pigs.

19:59.823 --> 20:00.782
Yardbirds.
-Yeah, exactly.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.700
Right.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.369
So you're keeping chickens.
You're also able to sell them,

20:04.453 --> 20:07.581
sell chicken dinners et cetera
to raise money for your freedom,

20:07.664 --> 20:10.292
or if you're free already, it's a way
that you could earn a living.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.879
So that kind of association
between black folks and fried chicken

20:13.962 --> 20:15.881
<i>goes back because of that.</i>

20:20.636 --> 20:25.224
<i>One thing is for certain. People</i>
<i>love fried chicken, but it's like...</i>

20:27.184 --> 20:29.394
I didn't know about this stuff
with fried chicken.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.148
You're not supposed to link

20:33.232 --> 20:36.568
fried chicken,
watermelon and black people,

20:36.652 --> 20:38.612
or African American culture or history.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.239
You just don't talk about it.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.284
What should we get?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.577
Some of my favorites.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.704
I highly recommend
the Southern pan-fried chicken.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.290
It's delicious.
Dinners come with two sides.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.833
White. Okay.
I'll get all dark. Yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.419
Okay. Fried chicken white?
Fried chicken dark?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.420
Right.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.423
I knew it would be weird if I ordered
fried chicken, but I wasn't...

20:58.507 --> 21:00.217
If I ordered something else
when we're dining, I didn't--

21:00.300 --> 21:01.260
Right, right.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.845
-Maybe that looks more weird. Yeah.
Yeah.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.223
Everything is so powerful. Right.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.518
And it's these invisible
assumptions we walk around with,

21:09.601 --> 21:13.063
or things we know, but don't really
know why they're a problem.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.650
Fried chicken dark
with black, cornbread dressing.

21:16.733 --> 21:17.734
-Fried chicken white.
-Thanks.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.362
Beautiful. That looks great.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:21.655 --> 21:26.243
So you don't feel like... Fried chicken
explosion around the world.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.287
People are eating a lot of it
right now.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.747
-I sell a lot of it.
-Cool.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.665
And, um--

21:31.748 --> 21:34.167
-It's delicious.

21:34.251 --> 21:38.005
It's dawned on me
that I've actually never known

21:38.088 --> 21:42.592
why black people don't want to be
associated with fried chicken.

21:42.676 --> 21:43.885
During enslavement,

21:43.969 --> 21:47.973
African Americans weren't frying up
buckets of chicken for ourselves, right?

21:48.056 --> 21:51.268
Platters of chicken. We were cooking that
for those who enslaved us.

21:51.351 --> 21:55.230
So, black people
started being associated with chicken

21:55.314 --> 21:58.442
and chicken products
in popular culture, right?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.986
Big lips, bulging eyes.

22:01.069 --> 22:05.407
The ways that those images
are described as cute, as fun,

22:05.490 --> 22:06.950
that's what makes them insidious.

22:07.034 --> 22:12.539
<i>That's what makes them evil.</i>
<i>And this is the only perception</i>

22:12.622 --> 22:15.042
that you have of black people and chicken.

22:15.125 --> 22:19.004
What's present-day examples of something
like this, which is horrifically sad?

22:19.087 --> 22:20.172
Well... Popeyes.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.132
Are you ready for a cooking lesson, honey?

22:22.215 --> 22:24.676
<i>She's a happy,</i>
<i>African American woman</i>

22:24.760 --> 22:28.555
<i>talking in a very Southern dialect,</i>

22:28.638 --> 22:32.559
<i>and the goal is to make everyone happy</i>
<i>with the fried chicken.</i>

22:32.642 --> 22:35.228
This is a meal
that will make your mama shout.

22:35.312 --> 22:40.108
So that's the modern day version,
really, of this kind of thing.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.527
I love Popeyes' chicken.
Yeah.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.904
But should I never eat this stuff?

22:43.987 --> 22:47.324
I mean, you could also see it
as the modern picture of this.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.367
Of black women selling chicken.

22:49.451 --> 22:53.246
<i>You can't tell me that these women,</i>
<i>though they were some of the first</i>

22:53.330 --> 22:56.833
African American female entrepreneurs
in Orange County, Virginia,

22:56.917 --> 23:00.212
probably didn't also smile
and play the role

23:00.295 --> 23:02.589
in order to get their food sold, right?

23:02.672 --> 23:07.886
So some of it is playing to the strength,
playing to the stereotype.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.641
I was doing
a fried chicken special on TV.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.684
Before we went on, my friend is like,

23:14.768 --> 23:17.604
"You're never gonna catch me
eating fried chicken on national TV."

23:17.687 --> 23:19.606
-And I didn't get it.
-Yeah.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.859
I didn't understand it and I don't think
I was really aware until I was...

23:22.943 --> 23:24.945
-Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

23:25.028 --> 23:28.865
Like, eating fried chicken
or, like, being told by...

23:28.949 --> 23:31.993
You know? "Don't eat fried chicken,
I will never eat fried chicken in public."

23:32.077 --> 23:36.873
A single black person carries the weight
of the black community on their back.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.501
<i>Because part of being black in America</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:44.256
<i>is you get often reduced to the stereotype</i>
<i>of angry, lazy, shiftless,</i>

23:44.339 --> 23:46.424
chicken-eating black person,

23:46.508 --> 23:49.636
and nobody wants to put themselves
out there in that way.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.609
<i>Busy Bee is in a historically</i>
<i>black area of Atlanta,</i>

24:04.693 --> 24:06.236
<i>doing traditional soul food</i>

24:06.319 --> 24:09.447
<i>as you could imagine it being served,</i>
<i>say, 30 years ago.</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:11.783
<i>But the feel of that place is modern.</i>

24:12.826 --> 24:17.122
<i>Busy Bee exemplifies the ideal</i>
<i>of the new South.</i>

24:17.205 --> 24:19.249
Of not abandoning who we were

24:19.332 --> 24:22.377
in order to become
what someone else thinks we should be.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.798
Fried chicken over here.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.133
Hello.
Hi.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.679
I love... Pressure fryers
are the coolest thing to me.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.098
It's been brined 12 hours,

24:35.182 --> 24:39.060
and we don't dip it in milk batter
or egg batter or anything.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.563
Giving away your secrets.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.315
Not all of them!

24:45.442 --> 24:46.610
You don't close the lid?

24:46.693 --> 24:49.821
Not yet. I let it sit for a little bit
because usually when I close it,

24:49.905 --> 24:52.490
right when I put the chicken in there,
everything sticks together.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.909
Too much moisture, right?

24:53.992 --> 24:56.369
Yeah, I let it get a little dry
a little bit, then I close it.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.704
-That's just experience there.
-Yeah.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.920
What's appropriate for me to say,
black food or soul food?

25:05.003 --> 25:07.631
-Um, I would say soul food.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.090
If I invite you over and I say,

25:09.174 --> 25:11.843
"Hey, Lolis, come over to my apartment.
I'm gonna cook some soul food."

25:11.927 --> 25:16.973
You're gonna give me a strange look.
You'd be like, "The fuck you saying?"

25:17.057 --> 25:19.476
-Well, it depends on how you spell "soul."

25:21.728 --> 25:25.815
So do all big cities in the South
have, like, a version of a Busy Bee?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.943
All these cities had these places.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.861
The question is,
how many of these places have survived?

25:30.946 --> 25:34.241
The way I first heard about this place,
when a friend of mine

25:34.324 --> 25:38.578
<i>did research</i>
<i>on the </i>Black Travelers' Green Book.

25:38.662 --> 25:42.249
<i>This was the book that would tell you</i>
<i>where, as a black traveler in the South,</i>

25:42.332 --> 25:45.418
<i>where you could find lodging,</i>
<i>where you could find food, </i>

25:45.502 --> 25:47.379
<i>where you could find a hairdresser.</i>

25:47.462 --> 25:50.924
<i>Because you couldn't just stop anywhere.</i>
<i>It could literally be fatal</i>

25:51.007 --> 25:53.885
if you went to the wrong place
asking to go to the bathroom.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.432
That's just a tremendously good
fried chicken.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.934
Mmm-hmm.

26:01.017 --> 26:05.897
This is a black community restaurant
that maintains quality and freshness.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.148
Go to these places, they say,

26:07.232 --> 26:09.734
"We make the food
just like our grandmother made it."

26:09.818 --> 26:12.821
Well, their grandmother came up
in the era of cans and frozen stuff

26:12.904 --> 26:16.950
and sometimes the food tastes like the way
their grandmother made it in a bad sense.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.620
So my hope is that we're moving
back into this direction,

26:20.704 --> 26:25.333
and that some of these young black chefs
will appreciate these traditions

26:25.417 --> 26:29.129
and expand on them in the way that
we see people of other traditions

26:29.212 --> 26:31.464
expanding on their own
indigenous ingredients.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.519
<i>I knew that I wanted</i>
<i>to open a restaurant.</i>

26:44.602 --> 26:46.521
<i>Yeah, that was the goal. </i>

26:47.355 --> 26:52.110
<i>For me, it's been a hard road</i>
<i>in figuring out my identity as a chef,</i>

26:52.193 --> 26:56.323
because I was raised in the South,
but what if I wasn't from the South?

26:56.406 --> 26:59.868
What if I was from the Midwest? A black
guy from the Midwest cooking. Like...

26:59.951 --> 27:02.120
-Mmm-hmm.

27:02.203 --> 27:07.334
No. I'm doing what represents what I feel
as a chef should be on my menu,

27:07.417 --> 27:10.795
and I wanted people
to experience that first and foremost.

27:11.338 --> 27:16.509
My French training, my Italian training
and my love for Southern cuisine.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.345
You know, if you're a Southern chef,
they figure all you can make

27:18.428 --> 27:20.305
-is ham hock and fried chicken.
And fried chicken. And--

27:20.388 --> 27:21.556
If you're a black chef--

27:21.639 --> 27:23.725
-Right.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.103
<i>This dish is kind of like</i>
<i>my take on fried chicken</i>

27:27.187 --> 27:28.980
<i>without being fried chicken.</i>

27:29.064 --> 27:32.984
I actually didn't want
to put fried chicken on my menu.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.862
It's the leg of duck.
We confit it, then we deep fry it.

27:35.945 --> 27:42.077
<i>We're serving it with quinoa,</i>
<i>a little bit of duck liver mousse...</i>

27:43.995 --> 27:46.206
huckleberry gastrique.

27:47.665 --> 27:51.211
Gonna finish it with pickled rhubarb,
some shaved rhubarb,

27:51.294 --> 27:53.755
and then flowers and herbs
from the garden.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.926
<i>You spent a lot of time</i>
<i>at the Thomas Keller Group,</i>

27:58.009 --> 28:01.930
<i>one of the premier</i>
<i>dining groups in the world.</i>

28:02.013 --> 28:06.142
The people of Seattle have embraced you.
You were named best new chef.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.144
<i>One of the best new chefs in the country.</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:15.110
So it seems that your path has been,
if not easy, then untainted by racism,

28:15.193 --> 28:18.071
or the implications of racism
and racial prejudice.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.532
Yes, no, maybe so.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.952
You know, I wanted people
to respect me as a chef,

28:24.035 --> 28:27.080
and not see me as a chef of color,

28:27.163 --> 28:29.707
in the sense, yeah,
it's obvious I'm a chef of color,

28:29.791 --> 28:34.087
but respect me that I can be
one of the best chefs,

28:34.170 --> 28:38.341
uh, and point blank, not the best chef
of color, but one of the best chefs.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.770
<i>I grew up playing</i>
<i>competitive golf.</i>

28:50.854 --> 28:55.859
In 1997, Fuzzy Zoeller made this comment
about Tiger Woods to reporters.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.361
<i>It was at Augusta National.</i>

28:58.445 --> 29:00.321
<i>One of the greatest,</i>
<i>if not greatest course in the world.</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:04.409
<i>In Georgia, by a white guy,</i>
<i>talking about fried chicken.</i>

29:04.492 --> 29:06.828
Uh, little boy's driving it well,
and he's putting well.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.872
He's doing everything it takes to win.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.582
So, you know what you guys do
when he gets in here?

29:10.665 --> 29:12.709
Pat him on the back.
Say congratulations, enjoy it,

29:12.792 --> 29:14.878
and tell him not to serve
fried chicken next year.

29:14.961 --> 29:19.382
Got it. All right. Or collard greens,
or whatever the hell they serve.

29:19.466 --> 29:24.637
But check this out, Fuzzy Zoeller did not
use any word that applied to race.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.098
<i>He didn't say "black."</i>
<i>He didn't say "African American."</i> <i>He didn't say that</i>
<i>and he didn't have to.</i>

29:29.642 --> 29:31.144
You talk about fried chicken,

29:31.227 --> 29:33.396
you talk about chitlins,
you talk about watermelon.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.356
You're talking about black people.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.400
And then that way,
you don't necessarily have to say it

29:37.484 --> 29:38.735
and you can code your racism.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.488
And by saying
they should serve him fried chicken,

29:41.571 --> 29:42.530
he's basically saying,

29:42.614 --> 29:45.950
"Well, he might be a great golfer,
but he's still a nigger."

29:46.701 --> 29:48.912
Even if you're the best golfer
in the world.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.498
Even if we play golf better than you,

29:51.581 --> 29:54.042
even if we're the main ones
frying the chicken,

29:54.125 --> 29:56.920
somehow we're still
three-fifths of a person.

30:10.517 --> 30:15.480
<i>I was in Atlanta</i>
<i>and my wife was a youth pastor</i>

30:15.563 --> 30:17.106
<i>and we came here as missionaries.</i>

30:17.190 --> 30:21.110
So you decide to open up,
I'm gonna say it, "Soul Food?"

30:21.194 --> 30:22.654
Actual soul food. Yeah.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.950
Actual soul food
in The Land of the Rising Sun.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.078
-You got fried chicken everywhere.
Oh, yeah.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.996
But, like, it seems to me

30:32.080 --> 30:38.628
that the thing that is still misunderstood
is Southern fried chicken.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.296
Mmm...

30:40.922 --> 30:43.341
Especially with the loaded meaning
of it all.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.760
That's a part of why I love
living in Japan,

30:45.844 --> 30:51.724
because that stereotype is taken so far
away from what it used to be.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.936
Yes, it was demeaning in the US,

30:55.019 --> 30:59.357
because that's what idiot people
thought that black people ate.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.484
And then you come to Japan and it's like,

31:01.568 --> 31:03.194
"Welcome to Japan.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.737
Would you like some fried chicken
and watermelon?"

31:04.821 --> 31:07.073
Oh, my God.
-But I do like it.

31:10.702 --> 31:15.373
Should people be eating fried chicken
without knowing the history behind it?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.835
Whether the meaning is known or not,

31:18.918 --> 31:20.879
it's knowing that when people walk
through these doors,

31:20.962 --> 31:23.339
what's most important is that they
can taste the love

31:23.423 --> 31:25.842
every single time
they taste. That's soul food.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.177
Why am I talking to you, man?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.888
-I don't know.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.849
Tennessee-style hot chicken.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.895
It's delicious.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.229
Thank you very much.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.565
Having lived here myself,
and being Korean...

31:41.316 --> 31:44.193
And Koreans, I've always felt,
historically in Japan,

31:44.277 --> 31:47.697
have been seen as second-class citizens,
for the most part.

31:47.780 --> 31:51.492
How does it feel to be
a black American in Japan?

31:51.576 --> 31:54.746
I found out that a lot of Japanese people
love black people.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.080
-Hmm.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.916
But as for the black community,

31:57.999 --> 32:03.796
it was always more, uh, Jamaican,
African and African American together.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.507
Half the people,
even Africans think I'm African.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.929
Do you wanna be, "No, I'm American."
Does that matter here?

32:14.974 --> 32:17.060
Probably a good thing.
I'm Canadian.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.523
This is the picture of America
that we enjoy seeing.

32:22.607 --> 32:26.527
Because so many different races
come here and they eat

32:26.611 --> 32:29.280
and, you know, we all just
enjoy each other's time.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.741
And that's it.
And that's the way it should be.

32:33.910 --> 32:38.081
<i>Introducing Chicken McNuggets.</i>

32:38.665 --> 32:41.376
<i>Ooh. McNuggets.</i>
<i>McDonald's...</i>

32:41.459 --> 32:42.877
Okay, so, the reason that I feel like

32:42.961 --> 32:46.089
you need to taste nuggets is that you
have a history of nugget-eating public...

32:46.172 --> 32:47.340
Of secret nugget eating.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.969
Uh, I do eat a lot of, like, trash food.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.553
Do you know
the origins of the nugget?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.806
There were a lot of studies
that were released in the '80s

32:54.889 --> 32:57.725
<i>about how beef is really bad for you</i>
<i>and people stopped going to McDonald's,</i>

32:57.809 --> 33:00.436
<i>and McDonald's wanted</i>
<i>to retain these customers,</i>

33:00.520 --> 33:03.898
<i>and so they had an idea that they would </i>
<i>use chicken to bring them back in,</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:06.901
<i>which was, like, you know, </i>
<i>a healthier, white meat.</i>

33:06.985 --> 33:10.154
<i>So McDonald's commissioned Tyson</i>
<i>to build a nugget for them.</i>

33:10.238 --> 33:12.198
<i>So Tyson makes</i>
<i>the McDonald's nugget?</i>

33:12.281 --> 33:14.951
<i>Yeah. It's, like, an incredibly</i>
<i>automated process.</i>

33:15.034 --> 33:17.578
<i>And when it comes out,</i>
<i>the chicken is cut out into the shapes,</i>

33:17.662 --> 33:18.663
<i>and they get frozen and shipped.</i>

33:18.746 --> 33:21.416
McDonald's claims that they have
four different shapes.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.376
The bell and the boot.

33:23.459 --> 33:27.422
Then it's the ball and the bow, but I mean
like, these all look like boots.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.425
<i>We have two batches</i>
<i>of nuggets ready.</i>

33:30.508 --> 33:31.509
<i>We have so many chicken nuggets</i>

33:31.592 --> 33:33.052
<i>and you guys are gonna cut this down</i>
<i>into, like,</i>

33:33.136 --> 33:34.262
a 30-second thing where I'm just going...

33:36.472 --> 33:37.765
<i>Do I need to do this with you, or--</i>

33:37.849 --> 33:38.975
<i>Yeah. You need to feed me.</i>

33:39.058 --> 33:42.061
-That's the gluten-free chicken nugget.

33:42.145 --> 33:46.190
It's very dry. Is there...
I should grab water, right?

33:46.274 --> 33:48.776
These nuggets
are shaped like dinosaurs.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.195
It's like spray foam
that's been flavored with chicken.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.489
Why are you throwing away
these perfectly good nuggets?

33:53.573 --> 33:57.035
This is the crucible
of your sadness here.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.578
These are the ones
you eat the most frequently?

33:58.661 --> 34:00.955
Some would call it sad, but, uh...
You know.

34:01.581 --> 34:05.376
They're so unoffensive that you could
scarf down 30.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.254
Cordon Bleu Chicken Poppers.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.840
-I just don't want to touch it.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.051
There's no resistance from any chicken.  Let's move on.
-To hell with that nugget.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.849
<i>I feel like nuggets </i>
<i>are a factory of regret.</i>

34:19.932 --> 34:22.477
How could they call
this chicken fry? Look.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.145
It's more like a finger.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.730
Wake up, people.

34:25.813 --> 34:26.981
These aren't chicken fries.
They're chicken fingers.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.152
<i>In summary...</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
-no one should eat chicken nuggets.

34:34.155 --> 34:38.034
Eat something else.
Just prepare a different thing.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.118
Thank you for doing this.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.454
-Sorry.
-No problem. Let's hug it out.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.924
<i>I just never expected</i>
<i>that you would live in Koreatown.</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:54.133
Uh-huh.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.303
And I feel like a real idiot for assuming

34:57.386 --> 35:00.306
that someone like you
would never live here.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.433
-That's okay.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.186
To assume is to make an ass
out of you and me.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.230
-So I guess you shouldn't assume anything.
-Yes.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.233
Yeah, I love living in Koreatown.

35:10.316 --> 35:14.946
<i>The food in Koreatown</i>
<i>is so goddamn good.</i>

35:15.029 --> 35:17.240
This is just the whole fried chicken,
it comes plain with no sauce.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.742
Would you say that
is a spatchcocked chicken?

35:19.826 --> 35:22.912
-It is a spatchcocked fried chicken.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.497
Without the bone in the center.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.166
I just wanted you to know
that I knew what spatchcock is.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.126
-It's a great name.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.212
This is delicious.
Mmm-hmm.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.966
Before the invention of
the modern-day Korean fried chicken,

35:35.049 --> 35:38.136
-this was Korean fried chicken.
Yeah. Exactly.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.638
-Oh, wow.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.265
Um, it's only just coated in flour.
It is.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.684
Flour, salt, pepper, that's it.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.102
And this restaurant
has been around how long?

35:46.185 --> 35:48.563
Um, since, like, the mid-'90s.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.939
Well before
the Korean fried chicken craze.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.191
-Exactly. So it's kinda one of the OGs.
Mmm.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.361
Hot wings. It's got, like, a sweet
and spicy sauce coated around it.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.613
People come in
mostly for this one now, right?

35:57.697 --> 36:00.116
Yeah.
-All right, I'm gonna eat the wing.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.370
Yeah, that's really good.

36:04.453 --> 36:07.999
Well, I like them both.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.251
It's hard to invent something new,

36:10.334 --> 36:13.963
and somehow the Koreans
invented a new kind of fried chicken.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.841
How would you describe... What's
the difference

36:16.924 --> 36:20.136
-It's a double-fried type of thing.
Uh-huh.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.264
<i>Very thin crust that shatters</i>
<i>when you bite into it,</i>

36:23.347 --> 36:27.101
<i>with a sweet soy glaze</i>
<i>or something that's really spicy.</i>

36:27.185 --> 36:30.813
The weird thing is, I have
a version of this in sandwich form.

36:30.897 --> 36:35.234
It's basically a spicy fried chicken
sandwich with Korean dressing on it.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.861
But I don't have a Korean name with it.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.779
So maybe I'm part of the problem
right now.

36:38.863 --> 36:39.947
Do you miss that?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.533
Like, is that a weird thing
about becoming a successful chef,

36:42.617 --> 36:44.535
-Very hot.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.037
I do miss it.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.914
-You're only worried about your station.
-Yeah.

36:47.997 --> 36:51.167
You know everything you need to do.
You can control it.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.627
When you're really good at your job,

36:52.710 --> 36:54.712
you can almost
intentionally get in the weeds.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.172
-Yeah.
-'Cause that's fun.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.256
Yeah, it's an interesting thing.

36:57.340 --> 37:01.636
Like, I don't get scared on set
to act anymore in the way that I used to.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.222
It's sort of like where you're
talking about mastering your station,

37:04.305 --> 37:07.183
where, when you first start,
it's completely overwhelming.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.602
You're fucking up all the time,
you're getting yelled at,

37:09.685 --> 37:12.063
and then at a certain point,
maybe you could go on autopilot?

37:12.146 --> 37:13.564
I don't know what's it like to be a cook.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.025
You can.
And that's where you get in trouble.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.736
If you're not nervous
or nauseous every day,

37:18.819 --> 37:21.614
-then you're gonna regress.
-Yeah.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.241
So there are a lot of similarities
in cooking and acting.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.450
I think there are.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.496
Because, like, this innovation happens
because someone does it every day.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.165
It's like, "Well, I can make this a little
bit better or a little bit different."

37:31.249 --> 37:32.583
And then it just keeps on going.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.418
Where do you think it's gonna go?

37:34.502 --> 37:38.089
If kimchi can become popular
in my lifetime,

37:38.172 --> 37:41.133
then anything can happen with Korean food.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.929
But I think it's inevitable that you're
gonna see Korean fried chicken

37:45.012 --> 37:49.267
-on menus at Ruby Tuesdays or TGI Fridays.
-Mmm-hmm.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.811
Um, I don't know how I feel about that.

37:53.729 --> 37:57.358
I think it's... One hand, it's fantastic,
and another hand, it makes me sad.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.235
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.279
I guess that's the whole thing, right?

38:01.362 --> 38:05.408
-Yeah, progress.

38:09.495 --> 38:15.710
If I grew up in Nashville, and I ate
Bolton's fried chicken as a kid,

38:15.793 --> 38:18.504
and then I got into cooking,
and I left fine dining,

38:18.587 --> 38:20.172
and I wanted to open up a restaurant,

38:20.256 --> 38:24.760
my initial reaction, first thing,
'cause comedians or actors or writers,

38:24.844 --> 38:27.013
you always go
to your first things in your life.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.724
I'd probably be like, "Oh, I want to make
a fried chicken shop.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.143
And I want to do it
as a homage to Bolton's.

38:32.226 --> 38:36.314
I love it so much
and I respect it so much,

38:36.397 --> 38:39.233
I want to make
the best damn version possible."

38:42.403 --> 38:44.905
So, can you tell me a little
about the history of it?

38:44.989 --> 38:48.617
My father opened a meat and three
in Franklin, Cool Springs,

38:48.701 --> 38:53.039
kind of a south suburb of Nashville.
I started working with him out there.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.459
And so he'd go to Bolton's or Prince's
or Pepperfire, and he'd bring it back,

38:56.542 --> 38:59.086
and we just put together our own blend,
and then people started ordering it.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.297
<i>I think that's kind of when he realized </i>
<i>we had something.</i>

39:01.380 --> 39:04.258
And so it was kind of this sort of
falling back in love with something that,

39:04.342 --> 39:08.387
uh, you grew up eating and always knew
was very much a Nashville thing.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.348
<i>People are queued up outside.</i>

39:10.431 --> 39:11.474
<i>They love your restaurant,</i>

39:11.557 --> 39:14.810
<i>and from what I've tasted so far,</i>
<i>I want to crush this.</i>

39:15.686 --> 39:19.899
Another point is, are you aware
of what critics say about you guys?

39:19.982 --> 39:21.275
Yeah, yeah, yes.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.652
You guys are white guys
selling something

39:23.736 --> 39:26.864
that was based on something
that was not of your culture.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.910
Well, we're gonna do it right,
and we're gonna be respectful of it.

39:30.993 --> 39:34.246
And I don't think the way
that people may have

39:34.330 --> 39:36.874
20 years ago, 100 years ago,
200 years ago, so...

39:36.957 --> 39:42.880
Yeah, I have to live for today
and to try to be a good person.

39:42.963 --> 39:46.759
As someone that is crushing your food,
and loves your food...

39:46.842 --> 39:48.344
This is really good, man,
by the way.

39:48.427 --> 39:51.389
-Mmm-hmm.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.849
-But you do, and you do.
-Yeah.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.185
How do you be respectful?

39:57.061 --> 40:00.731
I can't tackle all
of the bigger stuff by myself,

40:00.815 --> 40:04.860
I just know that as long as
we're good sort of tenants of it, um,

40:04.944 --> 40:06.278
that's the best we can do.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.073
I'll always pay an homage to the Prince's

40:09.156 --> 40:10.991
and being able to tell
that story of Bolton's,

40:11.075 --> 40:15.871
and kinda the people that paved the way
before we ever were even thought of.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.374
You're adding value,
you're adding to the community,

40:18.457 --> 40:21.627
but what if you start killing
the very thing that inspired this?

40:21.710 --> 40:25.673
-You kill Prince's, you kill Bolton's.
Yeah, that's the scary part.

40:25.756 --> 40:29.427
When we take it on
as our obsession and passion,

40:29.510 --> 40:32.221
there's a lot of stuff that comes along
with that. You know?

40:32.304 --> 40:33.973
There's a lot of stuff
that comes along with that.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.185
And that's a lot more complex
than just cooking food.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.896
Stuff that on the front end,
you would have never thought about,

40:40.980 --> 40:43.023
'cause you just wanted
to make good food, right?

40:43.607 --> 40:47.278
Progress is change and change
is progress. You hope for the best.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.195
Right.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.699
Now, do you eat hot chicken
anywhere else outside of Bolton's?

40:51.782 --> 40:52.700
No.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.493
How do you feel about other establishments
selling hot chicken?

40:54.577 --> 40:56.829
I think everybody has something to offer.

40:56.912 --> 41:00.124
<i>Some people came in on a commercial end,</i>
<i>and benefited off of it.</i>

41:00.207 --> 41:03.252
But they don't have an idea
of what authentic hot chicken is,

41:03.335 --> 41:05.921
but they go for it, and to each his own.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.383
It cuts a little bit but, you know,
you just shake it off and go on.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.052
'Cause we know what we got,
we know what we do.

41:12.136 --> 41:16.390
Would you ever open up in a more
traditionally more affluent community?

41:16.474 --> 41:21.395
Yes, but everybody can't afford
that $4,000, $5,000 rent.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.939
I like Hattie B's. It's delicious.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.901
I think though, that one of the things is,

41:26.984 --> 41:31.780
you've never marketed for, intentionally,
a whiter, more affluent audience.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.240
That's what they come for though.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.202
They wanted a place
where they could feel comfortable

41:36.285 --> 41:38.829
and have beer and enjoy hot chicken.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.081
<i>And they jumped on the opportunity.</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:44.001
Do you begrudge them for that?
-No.

41:44.084 --> 41:48.422
I'm amazed that you're able to keep it
as calm and cool and loving as you are.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.884
Well, that comes from
just having love in your heart,

41:51.967 --> 41:54.178
and knowing when you do what's right,

41:54.261 --> 41:58.015
and do the best that you can do,
in what you do,

41:58.098 --> 42:01.185
you're gonna always
be maintained and sustained.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.437
So we just go with the flow.

42:03.521 --> 42:07.149
Whoever comes through that door
gets the same respect.

42:09.568 --> 42:15.241
I guess with fried chicken, then, or just
soul food in general, too, how to...

42:15.324 --> 42:17.660
If I was, for instance... I see a lot of white guys
making Korean food,

42:20.162 --> 42:22.122
and I'll be honest,
it pisses the shit out of me. 'Cause it's everywhere now.
Kimchi this, kimchi that.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.711
I'm like, "You weren't ostracized
in elementary school,

42:27.795 --> 42:30.881
'cause everyone thought, when they visited
your house, it smelled like garbage."

42:30.965 --> 42:34.677
Right? Like, they didn't have
to endure emotional hardship.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.555
And now it's cool, and...

42:37.638 --> 42:41.267
But when you close your eyes and taste it,
does it always taste like it lacks that?

42:41.350 --> 42:44.395
I can't like it.
It's impossible for me to like.

42:44.478 --> 42:48.482
-I am sorry. I can't like it.
-See, but that...

42:48.566 --> 42:52.444
I will pick that fight with you,
'cause I actually think

42:52.528 --> 42:57.032
that the American experience is actually
an experience of cultural appropriation.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.492
It's what we do best.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.538
We are the greatest mutts
that history ever put together.

43:02.621 --> 43:06.041
And we drag everything
through the collective,

43:06.125 --> 43:10.212
and it comes out different.
We wouldn't have anything without it.

43:18.804 --> 43:21.515
<i>So, we're at the Buford Highway</i>
<i>Farmers Market.</i>

43:21.599 --> 43:24.977
<i>For me and my fellow chefs in Atlanta,</i>
<i>it's like a dream market.</i>

43:26.228 --> 43:29.648
The global world is literally
at your fingertips here.

43:31.817 --> 43:34.737
<i>I never thought that I would have access</i>
<i>to the ingredients</i>

43:34.820 --> 43:36.614
<i>that I have access to today.</i>

43:36.697 --> 43:41.201
It's really a thing of beauty for a chef
who is an immigrant chef like me.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.581
<i>I showcase very regional Indian cuisine.</i>

43:45.664 --> 43:49.293
It's the region that I come from,
which is the southern tip of India.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.632
<i>I was raised Roman Catholic.</i>
<i>I grew up eating beef and pork.</i>

43:54.715 --> 43:57.468
So it's very different
than the natural assumption

43:57.551 --> 43:59.470
that Americans have of Indian cuisine.

44:00.512 --> 44:05.559
So an important part of my fried chicken
recipe is the coconut oil.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.938
<i>I have a lot of herbs</i>
<i>that goes into my brine.</i>

44:10.022 --> 44:14.860
<i>I do a buttermilk brine</i>
<i>with mint, cilantro, green chili.</i>

44:14.943 --> 44:15.944
Ah! Yes.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.534
<i>Every time I make this fried chicken,</i>

44:22.618 --> 44:25.537
people tend to think
it's my Southern American influence,

44:25.621 --> 44:30.334
and I have to let them know
that every culture figured out

44:30.417 --> 44:33.837
if you drenched a bird in flour
and deep fried it,

44:33.921 --> 44:36.632
it was probably gonna be good.

44:36.715 --> 44:41.261
I think everybody has a fried bird,
and this is my mama's fried bird.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.888
Is it always boneless?

44:42.971 --> 44:46.058
I only do boneless,
skinless chicken thigh.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.059
Why?

44:47.142 --> 44:50.229
You tell me if I need
to leave the skin on for next time.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.355
No, I'm excited to try it.

44:53.065 --> 44:54.983
Can I taste the marinade?

44:55.067 --> 44:56.944
Um, it's raw chicken.
-I'm okay.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.320
Okay.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.783
People are probably freaking out
right now, but...

45:02.866 --> 45:04.618
I'm scared of raw chicken.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.581
-That almost tastes like kimchi to me.
Really?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.500
Because of the ginger
and the garlic and the salt.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.336
And it's heavy on the garlic.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.631
That coconut oil is awesome.

45:17.714 --> 45:20.759
It does everything
to this chicken, I'm telling you.

45:20.843 --> 45:25.389
And then this is a mixture
of garam masala, chili and salt.

45:25.472 --> 45:26.932
But if I'm not familiar
with garam masala,

45:27.015 --> 45:29.893
most people will probably think it tastes
like some kind of curry powder, right?

45:29.977 --> 45:32.729
-Exactly, and it's not.
-But it's not.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.524
We don't have anything
called curry powder in India.

45:35.607 --> 45:38.277
I'm so excited.

45:42.114 --> 45:43.073
-Mmm.
-Oh, yeah!

45:43.157 --> 45:44.908
That's so good.

45:44.992 --> 45:50.581
Man, boy, slow down.
The chicken dead, it ain't going nowhere.

45:50.664 --> 45:55.377
This is really unique.
Have you ever tasted anything like this?

45:55.461 --> 45:58.630
-I have not.
-All Kerala, all the way here.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.757
I did not expect this.
It's very good.

46:00.841 --> 46:04.094
I'm gonna try really hard
not to steal any ideas.

46:05.471 --> 46:07.764
<i>I always say, </i>
<i>what I put on a plate</i>

46:07.848 --> 46:09.766
<i>is the sum total </i>
<i>of my life experience, right?</i>

46:09.850 --> 46:13.228
You know, don't call my food "fusion."
I hate that word.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.771
It's the other F word.

46:14.855 --> 46:18.984
Let me ask you this though, 'cause you're
doing all this cooking in Atlanta.

46:19.067 --> 46:21.945
Which calls itself
something "the New South,"

46:22.029 --> 46:24.031
the sort of international South.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.699
Do you see that? Do you see the sense of

46:25.782 --> 46:29.536
other countries and cultures
coming to land and prosper here?

46:30.537 --> 46:34.583
Absolutely. Yeah, I see it among
my fellow American chefs

46:34.666 --> 46:37.377
in the way their cooking
has been influenced.

46:37.461 --> 46:41.757
This is where it is good
to have some authenticity, right?

46:41.840 --> 46:45.010
'Cause I'm always, like, trying
to push any boundary,

46:45.093 --> 46:49.389
but at some point
there's too much mixture, right?

46:49.473 --> 46:52.184
-We are there.
-I think it's about telling a story.

46:52.267 --> 46:54.144
It's great if it's supporting it,

46:54.228 --> 46:57.856
but if people can't own the story,
then I think it loses its power.

47:04.863 --> 47:06.823
<i>Salare is its own identity now.</i>

47:06.907 --> 47:10.285
<i>It is me, but how do I top Salare?</i>

47:10.369 --> 47:13.372
<i>And how do I present myself</i>
<i>to the fullest?</i>

47:13.455 --> 47:14.831
<i>My Southern roots </i>
<i>just kept calling, saying,</i>

47:14.915 --> 47:16.458
<i>"All right, let's do </i>
<i>a Southern restaurant. </i>

47:16.542 --> 47:18.168
<i>Let's do a Southern Restaurant."</i>

47:18.252 --> 47:21.380
Ended up finding this space that
became available right down the street.

47:21.463 --> 47:24.132
What I did is I named it, actually,
after my father.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.969
It's called Junebaby.
And so this is my new baby here.

47:29.137 --> 47:31.848
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that's been striking to me</i>

47:31.932 --> 47:36.186
is that so many of the emblematic
Southern chefs now are white.

47:36.270 --> 47:38.397
That was honestly
one of the driving forces

47:38.480 --> 47:41.483
which made me want to open up Junebaby.

47:41.567 --> 47:44.486
<i>I noticed that a lot of people of color </i>
<i>who did all the cooking </i>

47:44.570 --> 47:45.946
<i>were forgotten about.</i>

47:46.029 --> 47:47.990
And now Southern food became popular

47:48.073 --> 47:51.493
<i>because white chefs</i>
<i>were cooking Southern food.</i>

47:51.577 --> 47:55.747
I'm like, "What happened
to the Willie Mae's and the Chase?"

47:58.792 --> 48:00.502
<i>Why aren't they getting</i>
<i>that same highlight</i>

48:00.586 --> 48:03.046
as these new up and coming
hipster stars

48:03.130 --> 48:06.008
cooking the food
we've been cooking for years?

48:06.091 --> 48:08.510
It's important to know our history.

48:08.594 --> 48:10.262
Let's talk about it, let's celebrate it.

48:11.179 --> 48:14.975
<i>To understand, like, this food</i>
<i>is built on the struggle.</i>

48:16.893 --> 48:19.813
So these have been soaking overnight,
12 to 16 hours.

48:19.896 --> 48:21.898
A little bit of buttermilk and salt.

48:21.982 --> 48:26.153
<i>You told me that y'all only do</i>
<i>fried chicken on Sunday night.</i>

48:26.236 --> 48:30.073
But the roots of it starts with
West African slaves coming over,

48:30.157 --> 48:33.327
<i>cooking it in palm oil over an open fire.</i>

48:33.410 --> 48:35.162
<i>It didn't happen every day.</i>

48:35.245 --> 48:37.080
<i>And these franchised restaurants</i>
<i>make us assume</i>

48:37.164 --> 48:39.333
<i>that fried chicken</i>
<i>can be enjoyed every day.</i>

48:39.416 --> 48:44.004
And it shouldn't be, but it's delicious
and you want to be enjoying it.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.466
<i>Seems like </i>
<i>you got two missions here.</i>

48:47.549 --> 48:48.800
<i>You're trying to serve people</i>
<i>food they like,</i>

48:48.884 --> 48:51.595
<i>but it also looks like</i>
<i>you're trying to educate people.</i>

48:51.678 --> 48:54.348
I'm not trying to be like a teacher
or a political activist

48:54.431 --> 48:56.016
for Southern food right now.

48:56.099 --> 48:59.436
If it happens, it happens,
but I want to be able to cook good food.

48:59.519 --> 49:01.229
I want to be able to tell the story on it,

49:01.313 --> 49:03.940
so that people can understand
the significance of it.

49:04.024 --> 49:07.736
I'm tripping on seeing tweezers
in the kitchen these days as well.

49:07.819 --> 49:10.364
It's just to toss and turn,
but we don't do tweezer work.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.949
That was that fine dining
that I started out with.

49:13.033 --> 49:16.995
<i>As I found myself, I knew I actually</i>
<i>didn't want to be a tweezer restaurant.</i>

49:17.079 --> 49:20.916
<i>There's no plucking.</i>
<i>We cooking food for flavor here.</i>

49:25.629 --> 49:27.464
<i>I guess I am living up to tradition,</i>

49:27.547 --> 49:29.424
<i>cooking fried chicken,</i>
<i>Southern restaurant.</i>

49:29.508 --> 49:30.967
I'm gonna live up
to tradition eating it.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.177
You're damn right you should.

49:32.260 --> 49:36.139
All right, all right.
I'm going for the wings.

49:36.223 --> 49:37.557
I'm going for the thigh.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.646
Whoo! That's juicy. Did you see that?
It's all over me.

49:42.729 --> 49:46.983
Oh, man. I was too busy listening
to the music of the crust.

49:49.444 --> 49:50.445
Mmm-hmm.

49:51.905 --> 49:53.073
-Oh, yeah.
-Mmm-hmm.

49:54.032 --> 49:55.242
I'm happy with that.

49:55.325 --> 49:56.660
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.751
<i>We've come full circle.</i>

50:05.502 --> 50:07.713
Things African American
are being appreciated

50:07.796 --> 50:09.673
in ways that they haven't been before.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.260
<i>The hope is that we can realize</i>

50:13.343 --> 50:15.762
<i>that we can embrace</i>
<i>each other across our differences,</i>

50:15.846 --> 50:17.973
<i>and not necessarily use these things</i>

50:18.056 --> 50:21.143
<i>as cudgels to beat each other</i>
<i>over the head.</i>

50:21.226 --> 50:23.311
<i>What would you like to see happen</i>

50:23.395 --> 50:27.649
with these powerful subjects in food
with black culture?

50:27.733 --> 50:29.192
Do you want them to...

50:29.276 --> 50:32.404
Is the goal eventually
they'll just go away?

50:32.487 --> 50:35.115
What I really want is for people,
African American people in particular,

50:35.198 --> 50:37.159
to not be ashamed of their histories.

50:37.242 --> 50:39.161
<i>We tend to want to bury it.</i>

50:39.244 --> 50:44.040
<i>And yet, it's the root of everything</i>
<i>that we experience in today's society.</i>

50:46.460 --> 50:49.546
<i>It's this harmless little bird</i>

50:51.173 --> 50:54.968
<i>that is packed with some horrific stuff.</i>

51:00.348 --> 51:03.143
The three of us understand
some things about this country

51:03.226 --> 51:05.812
most white Americans
cannot teach themselves.

51:05.896 --> 51:09.941
The idea of the immigrants
defining and redefining America

51:10.025 --> 51:12.486
<i>has been going on</i>
<i>since at least the 1600s,</i>

51:12.569 --> 51:15.489
when the British first came here
without no goddamn papers,

51:15.572 --> 51:17.407
and nobody arrested their ass.

51:17.491 --> 51:18.366
Preach.

51:19.201 --> 51:20.368
Go on and get that spicy piece.

51:20.452 --> 51:22.412
I know you want
that last spicy piece. Go ahead.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.081
It's like...

51:25.749 --> 51:29.628
<i>My passion for Southern food</i>
<i>is very intense.</i>

51:29.711 --> 51:34.758
<i>And food is the gateway, is the link,</i>
<i>is the connecting piece</i>

51:35.467 --> 51:39.137
<i>that allows people</i>
<i>to share their realities and perspectives.</i>

51:39.221 --> 51:41.807
<i>So, hopefully, the racism...</i>

51:42.849 --> 51:46.186
<i>Hopefully, that behavior changes</i>
<i>when there's more knowledge there,</i>

51:46.269 --> 51:49.981
<i>there's more compassion there,</i>
<i>there's more empathy there.</i>

51:50.941 --> 51:54.152
Everything done here
is done by the heart.

51:54.236 --> 51:58.281
People of all nationalities,
creed, color, origin

51:58.365 --> 52:01.034
break bread together
and be happy together.

52:01.117 --> 52:03.912
<i>Full of love, peace, joy and happiness.</i>

52:05.622 --> 52:09.876
And the best you can do, maybe,
is by using it as inspiration, an homage,

52:09.960 --> 52:11.878
and giving credit where credit is due,

52:11.962 --> 52:16.591
<i>and doing your best to execute the best</i>
<i>goddamn thing you can possibly do.</i>
