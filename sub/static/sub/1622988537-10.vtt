WEBVTT

00:09.760 --> 00:11.553
I can't believe it's really you.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.891
Tommy, why don't you show her your room?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.564
It's okay.

00:55.222 --> 00:59.059
How long have you been living here?
Has it just been you and your dad?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.645
My mom died when I was little.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.063
Oh.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.317
I'm sorry.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.656
Hey. Don't worry,
our dads are just old friends.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.408
You wanna show me some of your toys?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.712
These were my grandpa's.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.237
Do you wanna show me how they fly?

01:52.905 --> 01:54.823
I just don't really know what to say.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.035
I can't believe it's really you.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.079
Why'd you come looking for me?

02:01.163 --> 02:03.582
We had no idea you were here.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.543
How could we?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.547
I'm sorry. I'm just--

02:10.631 --> 02:11.632
I'm...

02:12.633 --> 02:14.718
I'm a little stunned. I mean...

02:15.511 --> 02:17.554
we're looking for Arthur Conway.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.974
Yeah, my daughter,
she's a reporter like me.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.643
And we just wanna ask him some questions.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.894
About what?

02:25.312 --> 02:30.108
Well, about his time at-- at Strata.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.737
Yeah, we-- we know he's a whistleblower.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.794
Where have you been?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.590
And what are you doing here?

02:55.509 --> 02:58.595
I'm sorry. It's just too--
How do you know Arthur Conway?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.763
How do you know him?

03:00.472 --> 03:02.432
He was the one who brought me here.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.022
Wait, he kidnapped you?

03:09.523 --> 03:12.192
I don't understand.
Why would he kidnap you?

03:12.693 --> 03:16.280
He didn't kidnap me, Matt. He rescued me.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.985
Well, Arthur rescued you?
Well, from what?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.449
I'm the reason he had to blow the whistle.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.206
When my mom got sick,

04:07.789 --> 04:11.126
she started taking me down to the airfield
to watch the planes take off.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.254
That's where I met Arthur.

04:14.338 --> 04:18.425
I didn't know it then,
but Arthur was my biological father.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.447
Did anyone else know?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.325
I don't think so.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.787
My mom, she warned me not to tell anyone
about going to the airfield.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.873
I think
she didn't want anyone to find out.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.917
Things were hard enough at home.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.585
I have an idea.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.631
How about no present?
What do you think about that?

05:02.469 --> 05:03.595
Yeah. Well, I...

05:04.596 --> 05:06.014
I get that.

05:06.849 --> 05:10.060
My mom knew she wasn't gonna be around
forever to take care of me, and...

05:11.520 --> 05:14.523
...hanging out at Strata,
that's where I was happy.

05:17.109 --> 05:20.821
One day, I overheard something
I wasn't supposed to hear.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.578
Arthur let me check out a new plane
as it was being built.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.627
These executives were talking
about a chemical called cadmium,

05:35.711 --> 05:37.337
about how toxic it was.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.091
They didn't want anyone to know
that the company had been using it.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.844
They were planning to dump it
outside of town somewhere.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.971
I warned Hank and Arthur,

05:46.054 --> 05:50.559
and they thought by coming forward,
they could force Strata to tell the truth.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.188
But instead...

05:56.398 --> 05:57.858
they came after us.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.694
He had to figure out
how to get me out of there

06:00.777 --> 06:03.030
so that Strata would never find me,

06:03.113 --> 06:05.449
but he put his trust in the wrong guy.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.410
It wasn't his fault
that it all went wrong.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.703
Richie!

06:11.288 --> 06:13.332
When we didn't show up
at the meeting point,

06:14.124 --> 06:19.129
Dad came looking for me,
and we've been in Canada ever since.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.761
I knew it.
Strata was the reason you had to leave.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.431
You knew they were using that chemical
that was making people sick.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.102
Please. Come back.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.398
You're the eyewitness we need.
Dad, we can finally take them down.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.526
Take down who? What is she talking about?

06:40.609 --> 06:45.072
Strata. They're denying everything,
and they're the reason my Pop-Pop died.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.366
Your dad?

06:50.953 --> 06:52.412
What happened to him?

06:53.163 --> 06:54.665
It was cadmium.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.002
Yeah, they're saying they didn't know
it was dangerous back then, but...

06:59.837 --> 07:02.339
They're lying. They knew.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.134
And Arthur had proof, a smoking gun.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.681
He caught one of the executives on tape
admitting it.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.101
He was gonna bring the tape to the police
once he had Strata's dump site.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.228
But then...

07:16.311 --> 07:18.188
They sabotaged Hank's plane.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.731
They killed him.

07:21.692 --> 07:26.613
Yeah. Arthur left town that night
and made a plan to get me out of there.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.616
Where's the tape now?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.578
I don't know.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.581
Dad would never tell me where it was.
He...

07:37.749 --> 07:40.043
He didn't want me going into town
looking for it. It was...

07:41.295 --> 07:43.547
too dangerous for me in Erie Harbor.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.802
Let me go!

07:48.886 --> 07:51.597
Don't worry.
We're taking you someplace safe!

07:53.682 --> 07:55.142
I killed a man, Matt.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.479
I can never go back.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.191
Wait, Richie, I--

08:02.274 --> 08:06.320
Okay, don't-- don't call me that.
That's not who I am anymore.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.781
My... My son,
he doesn't even know who that person is.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.408
I'm not gonna lose him over this.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.580
I'm sorry. You have to go.
I can't help you. I--

08:19.041 --> 08:20.125
You gotta go.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.543
But we can fight this.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.879
Together.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.797
Right, Dad?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.470
No. We should go.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.390
Yeah. We gotta leave.
We should go. Come on, sweetie.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.746
There were always people
who cared about you in Erie Harbor.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.835
We never gave up on you.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.969
Yeah, a few people have come forward.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.764
What years did you say
that your father worked at Strata?

09:15.848 --> 09:18.600
Small-cell carcinoma, plant four.

09:19.309 --> 09:23.105
Okay. Yeah. Thank you. I will be in touch.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.775
So many people in this town
have family members with symptoms.

09:26.859 --> 09:30.404
Lung and kidney problems, memory loss.

09:30.487 --> 09:34.408
That means we have a case though, right?
Shared symptoms means there's a link.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.121
Yeah, well, not if people are too scared
to come forward.

09:39.705 --> 09:43.333
Look, what we need more than anything
is plaintiffs, a lot more.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.879
Class actions only work when hundreds
of people accuse a company of wrongdoing.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.382
What, so hundreds of people have to
get hurt before anyone believes them?

09:50.465 --> 09:51.675
That's so messed up.

09:52.885 --> 09:53.886
I know.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.517
What if we could, like, show people
that they're not alone?

10:01.393 --> 10:06.315
I don't know. Bring them together and,
like, have a meeting. Like in person.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.484
Town hall. That's a great idea.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.863
I mean,
I barely spoke to anyone at my school,

10:12.946 --> 10:16.992
but, you know, at the walkout,
suddenly everyone was listening.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.249
Hey. How'd it go?

10:28.837 --> 10:30.130
What's going on?

10:35.093 --> 10:36.470
We found him.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.555
Arthur was there?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.725
-What did he say?
-No, Bridge.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.521
We found Richie.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.981
What?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.569
He's alive.

10:58.242 --> 11:01.286
Wait, so, Richie knew the entire time
that Sam was in prison,

11:01.370 --> 11:03.497
and didn't tell anyone
they had the wrong guy?

11:03.580 --> 11:05.082
Look, you don't know that.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.877
You know, he was in a different country,
and it was a local story.

11:08.961 --> 11:09.962
Yeah.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.048
Things were different before the Internet.
News was harder to spread.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.050
Yeah, he probably didn't even wanna know.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.095
But he could be here now,
helping all these people.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.055
And he won't do it?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.015
You know, it's complicated, Hilde.

11:22.766 --> 11:27.020
He was scared for his life, right?
He accidentally killed a man. Right?

11:27.104 --> 11:30.023
When he was not much older than you.
Like, imagine that.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.526
Mom, what does all this mean legally?

11:33.485 --> 11:37.322
Legally,
coming back could mean risking jail time.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.284
-But he was defending himself.
-I know, honey.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.078
And he probably--
He won't go to jail for it.

11:43.161 --> 11:47.541
But honestly,
now that we know that he's alive,

11:47.624 --> 11:49.877
I think we're obligated
to tell the police.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.421
Otherwise, we're covering it up.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.300
But Sam deserves to know the truth,
and Richie should be the one to tell him.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.221
All right, look. I gotta go handle this.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.936
Okay. You did the right thing.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.315
And obviously
there are extenuating circumstances,

12:11.398 --> 12:15.110
but the state needs to know
that Richie is alive.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.490
What'll happen to him?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.951
Well, he'll be extradited
back to Erie Harbor.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.872
-Probably have to face his day in court.
-Oh, Jesus.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.708
Given the facts,
the DA might not prosecute.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.128
Look, guys,
there is a protocol that I have to follow.

12:33.212 --> 12:34.463
Right.

12:37.508 --> 12:41.345
You really saw him yourself?
It was really him?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.642
Yeah. Yeah, I saw him.

12:47.976 --> 12:48.977
He...

12:50.854 --> 12:52.731
He seems scared, Frank.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.903
-He had a son?
-Yeah.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.866
Yeah. He did, yeah. A little boy, Tommy.

13:02.950 --> 13:07.120
That's where our Richie was, man.
It was right in his boy's face.

13:07.788 --> 13:11.333
Really. It was good to see.
It was good to see it for a moment.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.714
Let me go.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.093
And I can talk Richie down, I can...

13:22.928 --> 13:25.722
explain everything beforehand.
I can protect him.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.896
Can you wait to call it in until tomorrow?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.775
I can't if you ask me to.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.069
Then I'm not asking.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.625
I overheard some company executives
say that it was the cadmium.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.712
-That they tested it, and it was toxic.
-Hey. What's going on?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.339
Richie said there's a smoking gun.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.593
Arthur had a confession tape
that could take Strata down,

14:02.676 --> 14:05.888
but he left it behind in Erie Harbor.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.892
I was showing my friend's kid
the new planes.

14:09.975 --> 14:14.062
That kid was Richie. Richie's the one
who overheard the executives.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.648
That must have been
when he became Strata's target.

14:16.732 --> 14:20.569
But the confession tape could be anywhere.
How are you gonna track it down?

14:20.652 --> 14:24.281
Well, let's think.
Yeah, what do we know?

14:24.865 --> 14:28.076
We know Arthur was holding on to the tape
until the day Hank's plane crashed

14:28.160 --> 14:30.287
'cause he was planning on
taking that to the police.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.374
And Richie said that Arthur left town
that night because he was so scared.

14:40.464 --> 14:46.345
Dad, look. Hank Gillis crashed
the afternoon of October 24th, 1987.

14:46.428 --> 14:49.097
We just have to find out
what Arthur did that day.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.766
Oh, yeah, sure. Just that.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.981
Dad, is there anything you can remember
about the day Hank Gillis crashed?

14:59.775 --> 15:02.277
Guys, guys, hold up.
Hold up. I wanna take a picture.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.487
All right.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.281
Get together. You guys.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.467
Yeah, that's right.

15:27.678 --> 15:31.181
We were supposed to go
on a fishing trip that day. Yeah.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.226
Yeah, let's see.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.398
Yeah, look.
There it is. Look. Look at that date.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.610
And you know what?
I remember Arthur being there.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.154
He was the one who told us
about Hank Gillis's plane crash.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.239
It was him.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.457
Do you think the tape
could be on Pop-Pop's boat?

15:58.041 --> 16:00.419
I mean, it's not a bad lead.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.338
Get as many people as you can
to come to the town hall.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.591
We can convince them.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.647
All hands on deck, right?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.903
All right, let's-- let's do this. Come on.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.655
-Ladies first.
-Thanks.

16:28.739 --> 16:32.868
We're hosting a town hall for anyone
who may have been hurt by Strata.

16:32.951 --> 16:36.830
Feel free to give the other one to anybody
that you think may wanna show up, okay?

16:36.914 --> 16:39.458
Thank you guys so much.
Have a good night, okay?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.251
Yeah. And I mean, it's all pro bono.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.295
We wanna help people
get their medical bills paid.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.963
Just come hear what they have to say.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.549
Your brother, Jimmy,
you tell him he ought to come out too.

16:47.633 --> 16:50.511
And if they've done anything
to your family, you or your family,

16:50.594 --> 16:51.637
you know anybody, please.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.765
I'll give you another flyer.
Feel free to spread the word. Hi.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.944
Is there any place we haven't checked?

17:07.027 --> 17:11.073
I don't know. I feel like
we've turned over this whole boat.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.411
Oh, no.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.413
What?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.960
Don't just say, "Oh, no,"
then go all quiet.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.755
Strata knows about your mom's lawsuit.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.092
My dad said they sent this
to the entire company.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.761
Wait, what? Here, let me see that.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.181
Wait.

17:36.265 --> 17:42.271
"Such false and defamatory claims threaten
our ongoing operations in Erie Harbor."

17:42.980 --> 17:44.857
So they're saying we're lying.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.943
No, they're threatening people's jobs.
That's what they're saying.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.321
I should go check on my dad.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.783
He forgets to eat when he's worried,
and he's hypoglycemic.

17:55.450 --> 17:59.788
I should go too.
I wanna hang these up at school.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.623
Fight fire with fire.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.001
-Well, thanks for helping out, guys.
-Of course.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.044
Try not to get arrested.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.510
-Add that one to the list.
-This checked out.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.513
-We're running out of flyers.
-Great. I mean, we'll get you more.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.766
Here you go.
I think we are gonna have a packed house.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.685
People are finally listening.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.731
Maybe not everybody.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.864
-I'll take these.
-Of course.

18:33.947 --> 18:34.990
Great.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.417
-Here. I'll go make some more copies.
-Thanks, sweetie.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.408
Hey, you know, it was 30 years ago, honey.

19:19.409 --> 19:23.038
You know, I doubt the tape
even survived half that time.

19:23.121 --> 19:26.500
You know, honestly, I don't think
we should've even gotten our hopes up.

19:40.097 --> 19:44.518
Arthur hid that tape knowing it was
the one thing that could protect Richie.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.730
Wherever he hid it,
it must've been somewhere safe.

19:48.814 --> 19:52.109
Yeah, that's true.
But I mean, I got no idea where.

19:53.694 --> 19:58.657
You know, apart from these old coins
that Pop-Pop hid in his tackle box,

19:59.575 --> 20:02.286
I mean,
well, there's just nothing else here.

20:03.829 --> 20:08.584
Dad, what if the tape was on the boat,
but he hid it somewhere else?

20:08.667 --> 20:09.960
Somewhere safer.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.923
Remember when Pop-Pop started
hiding things around the house?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.467
Yeah, like the safe in the attic.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.345
Right. Those were all things
he wanted to protect.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.848
That can't be there.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.267
Dad, what are you doing?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.603
Let me do it. Stop. Come on. Stop it.

20:31.982 --> 20:32.983
Hello.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.110
Can't sleep?

20:36.028 --> 20:37.905
I think I might know where the tape is.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.963
Just this notebook.

20:57.174 --> 20:58.550
Wait, what is this?

21:05.599 --> 21:09.061
Tape's not here. I was wrong. Again.

21:13.482 --> 21:16.026
Wait, I don't believe it. Look.

21:16.818 --> 21:20.906
Hey, look at this. He...
He knew something was wrong.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.619
Yeah. He knew the whole time
something was wrong.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.287
Look. He was onto 'em.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.334
Yeah, he must've seen all of his--

21:32.417 --> 21:34.545
all of his old friends from work
passing away,

21:34.628 --> 21:37.172
and he's trying
to piece it all together, look.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.803
He must've ran
out of time before he solved it.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.139
He got too sick.

21:51.228 --> 21:55.524
You know, I...
I could've helped him with this.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.695
Yeah, I could. I could. You know,
if I'd have been here, I would--

21:59.778 --> 22:02.155
I could've totally helped him
with all of this stuff.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.784
I just never knew.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.085
He didn't have the tape.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.341
Yeah.

22:23.427 --> 22:24.428
Yeah.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.294
Richie?

23:02.007 --> 23:03.008
Richie?

23:13.018 --> 23:14.019
Richie?

23:33.789 --> 23:36.291
Well, did Izzy say who vandalized it?

23:36.875 --> 23:37.876
No.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.712
I can't believe some townsperson
spray-painted our car.

23:40.796 --> 23:41.964
Or maybe it's Strata.

23:42.589 --> 23:46.301
Matt, it's a small town.
Everyone knows who we are, where we live.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.304
Yeah, well,
I think we should report it. We should.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.099
Maybe the town hall
isn't such a good idea.

23:52.182 --> 23:56.144
Mom, no. There's time to fix this.
We can still find the tape.

24:00.691 --> 24:03.735
All right. It's okay.
I'll go check it out.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.367
All right, it's good. We're good.

24:12.369 --> 24:15.664
Hey, guys. What's going on?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.126
What is it?

24:21.920 --> 24:22.921
Richie's gone.

24:23.005 --> 24:27.176
I held off calling it in for as long
as I could, but it didn't matter.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.845
It looks like he left
right after you guys were there.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.221
What?

25:39.331 --> 25:41.583
All right, kiddo.
It's just a couple more hours.

25:42.376 --> 25:45.754
Dad, why do they think that your name
is Richie Fife?

25:45.838 --> 25:47.548
-And who's Sam Gillis?
-What?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.351
Oh, my God.

26:06.358 --> 26:10.153
Hilde, let's go.
The town hall starts in 20 minutes.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.406
-Here, take this.
-All right, we all good?

26:12.489 --> 26:15.075
Dad. Dad, I can't find my notebook,

26:15.158 --> 26:18.662
and I was gonna hold it during my speech
or else my hands are gonna shake.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.999
Okay. All right. Now don't worry.
We'll-- All right, let's see.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.335
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you take this?

26:28.088 --> 26:30.174
Yeah, you can finish what he started.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.557
Hey, come on.

26:45.272 --> 26:46.773
All right, here we go.

26:54.406 --> 26:55.908
There's no one here.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.247
What's he doing here?

27:03.832 --> 27:04.917
Look.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.587
If you don't wanna do this,
you don't have to.

27:09.505 --> 27:14.176
No, I want him to hear this.
Even if it doesn't make a difference.

27:15.344 --> 27:18.805
The truth matters
because it matters to me.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.893
All right. You go get 'em.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.898
All right, come on. You got this.

27:39.034 --> 27:42.496
Whenever the community has concerns,
we're always happy to listen.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.082
It doesn't seem like
you have much support,

27:45.165 --> 27:48.836
so why don't you just go ahead and
say your piece, and we can all go home.

28:24.955 --> 28:25.956
Hi.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.586
I'm Hilde Lisko.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.421
And...

28:34.840 --> 28:36.925
as some of you may know...

28:40.262 --> 28:43.765
we lost my Pop-Pop
right before his 70th birthday.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.898
It was too fast.

28:56.153 --> 28:57.154
And...

29:02.159 --> 29:04.119
before he bought the bike shop,

29:04.203 --> 29:08.624
he worked at Strata Tech Industries,
spraying planes.

29:11.251 --> 29:14.796
How many of you worked there
or know someone who did?

29:39.446 --> 29:41.990
There are so many stories...

29:43.617 --> 29:46.078
like Pop-Pop's in this town.

29:49.039 --> 29:52.292
These are all photos
of former Strata employees

29:52.376 --> 29:55.128
who got sick and died too young.

29:56.296 --> 29:59.925
They're not just names or numbers,
they were people,

30:00.008 --> 30:01.552
people who were loved.

30:03.512 --> 30:05.597
She was somebody's mother.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.934
And he was somebody's son.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.690
Everybody wishes they had more time,

30:14.773 --> 30:17.234
but these people should've had it.

30:24.032 --> 30:28.161
We're all aware your mother's leading
a baseless lawsuit against our company,

30:28.245 --> 30:30.956
trying to benefit
off the misfortune of others.

30:31.039 --> 30:34.751
-Yeah? She's doing it for free.
-Yeah, you know, this family,

30:34.835 --> 30:36.837
they care about the truth
and helping people.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.338
I think we've heard enough.

30:40.966 --> 30:43.093
Your dad poisoned this town.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.430
Be careful, young lady.
My lawyer's with me.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.974
Hey, you know what?
Don't talk to her like that.

30:49.057 --> 30:52.352
Whatever you're accusing my father of,
I had nothing to do with it.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.439
While this is very sweet,
it's proof of nothing.

30:55.522 --> 30:57.649
You have no support. You have no case.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.411
I think you've got a case.

31:13.081 --> 31:15.417
Because now you have an eyewitness.

31:25.302 --> 31:26.553
Who are you?

31:29.515 --> 31:30.933
I'm Richie Fife.

31:52.204 --> 31:53.872
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

32:05.884 --> 32:06.885
Hi.

32:07.636 --> 32:11.515
When I read your articles,
I knew I had to come back.

32:16.854 --> 32:18.897
I feel like I've been running
my whole life...

32:20.023 --> 32:21.942
even when I was standing still.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.490
I didn't want my son to see me like that,

32:30.075 --> 32:31.326
running away.

32:36.331 --> 32:38.375
Your company needs to pay
for what it did...

32:39.835 --> 32:44.298
to my dad, to Richie, to me.

32:44.882 --> 32:46.008
And to the town.

33:06.403 --> 33:08.238
We couldn't find the tape.

33:09.072 --> 33:10.657
That's because I had it.

33:13.869 --> 33:18.123
I panicked. I was trying
to get rid of you, and... I'm sorry.

33:20.334 --> 33:21.627
I'm ashamed of that.

33:24.171 --> 33:25.506
Well, you're here now.

33:32.513 --> 33:36.767
Mr. Williams did not appreciate you
harassing him with these accusations.

33:37.309 --> 33:39.394
He needs to tell his workers,

33:39.937 --> 33:42.731
or we'll be forced to take public action.

33:49.029 --> 33:50.781
That was the deposition.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.699
We already have this.

33:52.783 --> 33:54.243
Sorry, but...

33:56.662 --> 33:58.205
it didn't change anything.

33:59.706 --> 34:00.832
Just wait.

34:07.881 --> 34:08.882
Arthur.

34:08.966 --> 34:10.717
Mr. Williams, sir.

34:10.801 --> 34:12.594
That's Grant's dad.

34:12.678 --> 34:16.098
So there's some
health and safety concerns.

34:16.181 --> 34:19.393
These people should be grateful
they've got a job at all.

34:19.476 --> 34:22.437
That Fife kid doesn't deserve
to get caught up in all this.

34:22.521 --> 34:25.190
Which executive did he overhear?

34:28.485 --> 34:30.195
I want a name.

34:30.779 --> 34:33.031
It wasn't an executive.

34:33.866 --> 34:36.534
It was Grant, your son.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.706
You knew.

34:41.790 --> 34:45.710
That kid never thinks
before he opens his mouth. Damn it.

34:47.795 --> 34:52.176
This is Arthur Conway.
It's September 20th, 1987.

34:58.515 --> 34:59.933
That doesn't change anything.

35:00.017 --> 35:02.436
I'll bury you in paperwork
for the next 20 years.

35:02.519 --> 35:04.021
That tape will never see the light of day.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.355
Too late.

35:31.965 --> 35:34.343
Grant Williams, you are under arrest.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.512
You have the right to remain silent.

35:36.595 --> 35:38.597
Anything you say...

35:45.145 --> 35:47.523
Hey, Hilde, Hilde. What did I tell you?

35:48.106 --> 35:50.275
You did it. You did it. Come here.

36:01.286 --> 36:04.790
I can't possibly make up
for all the time that you lost.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.461
That's on Sheriff Briggs, not you.

36:10.254 --> 36:13.632
You gotta believe me, Sam.
If I had ever known...

36:15.717 --> 36:17.427
You were just a kid, Richie.

36:18.428 --> 36:19.638
So were you.

37:13.692 --> 37:17.196
To all our loyal
Magic Hour Chronicle subscribers...

37:21.575 --> 37:22.659
we're back.

37:23.243 --> 37:24.953
We got a code 245.

37:25.621 --> 37:27.497
"Assault by deadly weapon."

37:28.957 --> 37:32.169
And for once we have some good news.

37:34.671 --> 37:37.174
In light of Grant Williams's
criminal behavior,

37:37.257 --> 37:40.677
Junior was able to
void the contract they signed.

37:40.761 --> 37:44.473
Trip and her dad got their farm back,
fully cleaned and restored.

37:45.265 --> 37:47.726
Izzy and my mom
got enough people to join their lawsuit,

37:47.809 --> 37:50.854
and she thinks Strata will have to
settle by the end of the year.

37:51.605 --> 37:54.441
Millions of dollars will go
to every family that they hurt.

37:55.692 --> 37:58.529
There are a lot of people
to thank for this,

37:58.612 --> 38:03.492
including, of course, Richie Fife,
where this story first began.

38:28.350 --> 38:31.144
You're really here.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.313
We thought about you so much.

38:34.815 --> 38:36.400
Yeah, no, I can see that.

38:37.651 --> 38:38.652
And you're okay?

38:40.112 --> 38:43.657
Yeah. I'm actually really good.

38:44.741 --> 38:46.535
I've had a good life.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.371
I always knew you were out there.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.251
Want a cookie?

38:54.334 --> 38:55.377
Oh, yeah.

38:58.547 --> 38:59.840
Perfect.

39:01.884 --> 39:04.303
I won't be publishing
any more stories about Richie.

39:04.386 --> 39:07.723
But I want to say for the record,

39:08.473 --> 39:11.185
I wouldn't be the reporter I am today
without him.

39:11.768 --> 39:14.396
And I know my dad feels the same way.

39:25.282 --> 39:27.242
What have you got there, apples?

39:27.326 --> 39:29.161
-That's it?
-I got some apples over here.

39:29.244 --> 39:32.497
-That's all you brought was apples?
-Yeah, something healthy. Hey.

39:32.581 --> 39:34.583
Hey, now we're talking.

39:36.668 --> 39:38.462
We're pretty unstoppable.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.767
Hey. My name's Kim.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.143
Nice to meet you.

39:54.728 --> 39:58.398
You know, your dad, he used to be
my best friend when I was your age.

39:59.441 --> 40:00.609
It's true.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.361
Hey, you.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.948
-Hey, man.
-What's up?

40:06.031 --> 40:08.492
-How's it going? You okay?
-Oh, yeah.

40:08.575 --> 40:09.576
Race you there.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.622
You know what I can't get over...

40:16.416 --> 40:19.336
-is how old we all are.
-Oh, God.

40:31.974 --> 40:35.269
I just can't believe we're all here.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.275
All because of a girl who never gave up...

40:43.193 --> 40:44.862
on a kid she never knew.

41:09.595 --> 41:12.973
So thank you to all of you.

41:13.056 --> 41:16.476
My friends and I will grow up
in a safer, cleaner world

41:16.560 --> 41:18.979
all because you were brave enough
to fight back.

41:27.779 --> 41:30.866
And I hope you have
some really good scoops for me.

41:30.949 --> 41:35.454
Because I am never ever
going to stop searching for the truth.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.047
You guys!

41:47.049 --> 41:49.968
Calling all units. 187.
Possible homicide.

42:21.542 --> 42:23.377
Hey, you kids can't be here.

42:24.586 --> 42:26.588
This is a crime scene.

42:26.672 --> 42:28.966
Come on. Let's go.
Donny, Spoon, on your bikes.

42:29.049 --> 42:31.051
-Hilde, let's go. Everybody out.
-Hey.

42:31.134 --> 42:33.345
-Come on, Frank.
-You can't be here, guys.

42:33.428 --> 42:34.847
Is that my notebook?
