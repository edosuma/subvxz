13:38.083 --> 13:38.084
-That's a weird name for a
fraternity.
-It's not a fraternity.
It started off as overflow
student housing.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.209
It started off as overflow
student housing.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.126
Now, it's just kind of there.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.250
Here's our stop.

Well, thank you for the tour,
Tyler.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.959
-Yeah, thank you.
-Sydney, you know what,

14:00.959 --> 14:03.126
-I'm just... I'm gonna meet you
inside.

You? Really?

14:12.583 --> 14:14.917
Yeah. Is it the shoes?

14:15.417 --> 14:17.625
(LAUGHS)
No. I love the shoes.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.084
The Kappas are just
a little... intense.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.792
Oh, well, it was
actually my mother's house.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.583
Ah. Legacy.
Is she all over you about
rushing?

14:27.417 --> 14:29.709
No. She died nine years ago.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.417
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.001
Kappas could use a girl like
you.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.834
I should know.
They're our sister sorority.

14:41.126 --> 14:43.333
Oh! So we'll be like
brother and sister!

14:45.208 --> 14:48.291
Not in, you know,
the related, familial way,

14:48.291 --> 14:51.250
but, you know, more in the
fraternal,
sororal...

14:51.250 --> 14:53.959
Sororital?
Is that a word? Sorry.

14:54.041 --> 14:56.209
I kind of tend to overtalk
when I'm nervous.

14:56.209 --> 14:59.500
It's a disease, one without a
cure.
So stop me any time, please.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.375
You're nervous?

15:01.167 --> 15:05.001
Oh, no. (CHUCKLES)
No, it's not you. Tyler, was it?

15:05.001 --> 15:07.167
No, it's because
of the whole rush, you know?

15:07.167 --> 15:10.166
The very term "rush" is an
amper-upper.
It amps up the old nerves.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.917
(CHUCKLES) I have to go.

Sydney, so pleased to meet you.

18:03.209 --> 18:06.583
I'm so excited.
My mom had a great experience
here.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.959
Katy, have you offered our guest
a drink from the refreshment
table?

18:09.959 --> 18:12.583
-I'm actually not that thirsty.
-No, no. Katy.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.458
The refreshment table?

18:20.375 --> 18:23.917
We have a situation.
That girl is not Kappa material.

18:23.917 --> 18:26.500
CHRISTY: Really?
I didn't see anything wrong with
her.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.291
Christy, you know
you're not as perceptive as I
am.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.126
That girl wouldn't know
her Gucci from her Pucci.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.583
Not to mention,
I saw her throwing herself

18:34.583 --> 18:36.625
all over Tyler before
she came in the house.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.167
It was embarrassing.
Trust me,

18:38.167 --> 18:40.167
we do not want a Kappa
who behaves that way.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.709
(SCOFFS) See what I mean?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.709
CHRISTY: But we have to give her
a bid.
She's a legacy.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.917
Her mom gets her the bid,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.250
but she has to survive pledging
all on her own.

19:11.792 --> 19:14.041

the hottest guy on campus.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.333

Oh, you know, I know that guy.
He was really nice.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.000
He showed me around Greek Row.

He's Rachel's boyfriend.

-Yeah, they're off right now,

19:29.291 --> 19:30.792

minute.

It's all part of Rachel's
20-year plan.

He'll be a top litigator,
she'll be a senator.

It's so romantic.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.625
Yeah, it does sound romantic.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.458
Because there is nothing more
romantic
than a 20-year plan.

we got in some trouble.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:07:00.001
Let's just say a few campus
ordinances
were violated.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:01.333
A few?

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.375
And you're working
your hours off here?

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:05.750
Nice to see you recruiting my
best
students, Tyler.

01:07:07.167 --> 01:07:10.167
-Sydney, happy to have you here.
-Happy to be here.

01:07:13.542 --> 01:07:18.250
So, do my hours tonight count
towards
working off Tyler's dirty deeds?

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:21.001
Actually, he fulfilled
his requirement last year.

01:07:21.001 --> 01:07:22.458
We just can't seem to get rid of
him.

Wow.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:44.208
This is beautiful.

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:54.417
If you look over there,
you can almost see Greek Row.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.667
Which is probably
the last thing you want to see.

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:02.375
Yeah. It's just...
Growing up without my mom,

01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:06.041
I was hoping that becoming a
Kappa
would help me connect with her.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.001
Sydney, you don't need Kappa.

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:14.750
I know. I feel close to her
just being at the school.

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:19.166
You know, I found her name
carved into my study carrel.

01:08:19.792 --> 01:08:21.001
No way.

01:08:26.126 --> 01:08:29.709

all your first non-dates?

no bathroom attendant.

were doing out with her?

I like Sydney. Deal with it.

I don't care if you like her or
not.

01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:43.333
All I care about is
our Greek Life Centre,

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:46.208
and Sydney and her band of
goobers
are screwing with our plans.

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.458
They don't have a shot
at winning the election, and you
know it.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.417
Maybe we should
just leave them alone.

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:54.083
That dump is obviously
really important to them.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.042
I don't know why anyone
would want to live there.

01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.209

condemned.

to blow the whole deal?

Terrence Lubinecki is not
a student at Southern Atlantic.

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:45.500
He graduated six years ago.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:50.667
I had to stay. There was just
so much more learning to do.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:54.458
(WHISPERING) Terrence,
maybe you should put on some
clothes.

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:56.125

-SIDNEY: Okay.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.042
Rachel, why don't you get
the hell out of here?

01:19:58.083 --> 01:20:00.250
Ooh, I love it when you get
rough.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:03.209
And, Ty, thanks for playing
your part so well.

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:05.166
That's the other good news.

01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:08.375
The Witchburn-Prince
Greek Life Centre is now a
reality.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.542
-Witchburn-Prince? What the
hell?
-Oh, you didn't tell her?

01:20:11.792 --> 01:20:15.583
I thought you guys were so
close.
It's a little joint project of
ours.

01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:18.209
And the only thing standing in
our way
was the Vortex.

01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:20.208
So, like you suggested, Tyler,

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:22.500
I went ahead
and had it condemned.

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.417
Now you can eat
with the homeless every night.

01:20:27.542 --> 01:20:29.083
You had something to do with
this?

01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:33.667
No. I mean,
I said the place was a dump,

01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:35.417
-but I didn't--
-Witchburn-Prince, huh?

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:38.167
So you wanted to tear down the
Vortex.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:42.250
-Yeah, I did, but--
-I don't want to hear it.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.542

-No.

about this, you guys.

alone.

along

01:21:12.166 --> 01:21:14.291
It's so important for us
to stand up to the Greeks

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:17.750
and show them
that they can't trample all over
us.

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:22.167

to have a place to live.

I could tell something wasn't

I could hear it in your voice.

and I drove all through the

you weren't at the Kappa house,

so many times, but...

and... I felt like I'd failed
her.

of person she was.

Hey.

Your mom was much more
than just a Kappa.

01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:37.625
She was a woman
who always fought
