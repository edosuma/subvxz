00:55.522 --> 00:57.823
<i>Every living person
on this planet</i>

00:57.825 --> 01:02.061
<i>has their own unique
pair of eyes,</i>

01:02.063 --> 01:03.829
<i>each their own universe.</i>

01:17.544 --> 01:19.711
<i>My name is Dr. Ian Gray.</i>

01:21.082 --> 01:22.614
<i>I'm a father,</i>

01:22.616 --> 01:24.750
<i>a husband</i>

01:24.752 --> 01:27.152
<i>and I'm a scientist.</i>

01:33.827 --> 01:37.196
<i>When I was a child,
I realized that the camera</i>

01:37.198 --> 01:40.866
<i>was designed exactly like
the human eye,</i>

01:40.868 --> 01:42.234
<i>taking in light
through a lens,</i>

01:42.236 --> 01:45.471
<i>forming it into images.</i>

01:45.473 --> 01:47.739
<i>I began taking
as many pictures of eyes</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:49.541
<i>as I possibly could.</i>

02:09.863 --> 02:11.864
<i>I'd like to tell you the story</i>

02:11.866 --> 02:14.500
<i>of the eyes
that changed my world.</i>

02:14.502 --> 02:16.602
<i>Remember these eyes.</i>

02:16.604 --> 02:19.638
<i>Remember all the details
in these eyes.</i>

02:22.675 --> 02:24.409
<i>Okay.</i>

02:32.452 --> 02:35.854
<i>It started when I was
a 26-year-old PhD student</i>

02:35.856 --> 02:37.422
<i>living in New York.</i>

02:37.424 --> 02:40.626
<i>It was Halloween,
eight years ago.</i>

03:17.730 --> 03:19.698
You okay?

03:23.369 --> 03:25.304
I'm watching the moon.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.915
Can I take a picture
of your eyes?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.951
Why?

03:41.588 --> 03:43.555
It's just something I do.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.761
Okay.
Yeah?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.730
I've perfected this.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.658
Hi.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.940
Hi.

04:22.328 --> 04:25.530
Do you know the story
of the Phasianidae?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.266
The... No.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.567
What's that?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.402
It's a bird...

04:30.404 --> 04:33.905
that experiences all of time
in one instant.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.442
And she sings the song
of love and anger

04:37.444 --> 04:39.611
and fear and joy
and sadness

04:39.613 --> 04:41.947
all at once...

04:41.949 --> 04:45.717
all combined
into one magnificent sound.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.452
Where are you from?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.555
Another planet.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.593
What does the bird
sound like?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.528
It sounds like this.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.563
Lean closer.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.502
Geez...

05:03.504 --> 05:05.037
It's more like noise.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.005
Yeah.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.545
And this bird...

05:13.547 --> 05:16.915
when she meets the
love of her life,

05:16.917 --> 05:20.585
is both happy and sad.

05:20.587 --> 05:24.990
Happy because she sees that,
for him, it is the beginning,

05:24.992 --> 05:29.361
and sad because she knows
it is already over.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.076
Hey, hey, do you want
to get a drink?

05:44.078 --> 05:45.744
I don't drink.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.982
Like, anything?

06:36.562 --> 06:39.698
You're not gonna regret this
in the morning, right?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.961
Your identity confirmed.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.705
I finished that
transcription factor program.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.810
Last night?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.645
No.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.147
This morning.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.650
'Cause, bitch, I don't play.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.052
Got the input genes,
and then you put

08:07.054 --> 08:08.220
your transcription factor...
Wait a minute.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.889
You... stink of vodka.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.624
I mean, like, bad.
Like, it smells...

08:12.626 --> 08:14.793
Yeah, I know, I know
I reek off vodka.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.228
Stop talking so loud.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.096
Okay, I consolidated
all your data

08:18.098 --> 08:19.798
into one database.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.199
You are welcome.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.068
You're amazing.
I hate you.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.237
Well, I love you...
that's why I do it.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.505
Oh, hey.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.174
You got a new rotating student.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.642
It's a first-year.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.644
Oh, sh...
Yeah.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.879
Yeah. Yeah.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.947
Have fun
babysitting, buddy.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.515
You need gum.

08:37.518 --> 08:41.119
You need...
to have fun babysitting.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.121
Karen.
Hi. Ian.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.824
Can I...?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.234
Follow me.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.105
<i>You're attempting to make</i>

09:00.107 --> 09:02.674
- color-blind mice see color?
- That's the idea.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.676
But after failed experiment

09:04.678 --> 09:06.945
352...

09:06.947 --> 09:08.146
we'll see.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.314
Why?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.949
Why what?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.285
Do so many experiments fail?

09:13.287 --> 09:17.055
Why are you interested in making
color-blind mice see color?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.757
Oh...

09:18.759 --> 09:20.325
Why not?

09:20.327 --> 09:23.295
How are you testing
that they see color?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.798
As the new rotating
lab assistant,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.968
your job will be
to do very boring,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.037
very repetitive
experiments,

09:32.039 --> 09:34.706
be a glorified note taker,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
and not ask me "why"
every five minutes.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.976
Okay?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.177
Cool.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.046
Commencing experiment...

09:41.048 --> 09:43.715
3-5-3,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.651
response to photo pigment
protein in <i> Mus musculus.</i>

09:46.653 --> 09:49.220
The control subjects
B Beta,

09:49.222 --> 09:51.256
G Gamma,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.725
E Euphoria,

09:53.727 --> 09:55.026
P...

09:55.028 --> 09:56.861
Psychopannychia.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.630
I don't know what that means.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.632
Look it up.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.799
"G" as in
goodness gracious,

10:00.801 --> 10:03.301
"H" as in help me, please,

10:03.303 --> 10:05.003
"Z" as in Zoolander,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.938
are the mice muted

10:06.940 --> 10:10.675
with the photo
pigment protein.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.177
When we animate
the lines...

10:12.179 --> 10:14.112
color-blind mice

10:14.114 --> 10:17.315
stare straight.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.317
Whereas...

10:19.319 --> 10:22.253
fingers crossed...

10:22.255 --> 10:24.823
the muted mice... shh...

10:26.859 --> 10:30.028
...track the lines
with their eyes.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.963
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.832
Is this on the background

10:33.834 --> 10:36.134
of PAX6 overexpression?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.738
You're a first-year?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.707
I know... it's surprising
I can put together a sentence.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.877
Sorry, I... I asked
my last three lab assistants

10:45.879 --> 10:48.313
not to come in
and I'd sign their credits.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.683
Anyway,
this is just one step

10:51.685 --> 10:55.320
in a very, very long... process.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.156
This is a rough estimation,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.191
but let's just say
that the human eye

11:00.193 --> 11:02.260
has 12 working parts, right?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.095
Simplest eye having one.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.231
So if we can
fill in the gaps...

11:06.233 --> 11:07.332
the evolutionary gaps...

11:07.334 --> 11:10.835
using single mutations,

11:10.837 --> 11:14.039
we can map out
the most logical progression

11:14.041 --> 11:16.274
of the most basic eye...

11:16.276 --> 11:20.278
to the most complex,
fully formed human eye.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.914
I don't understand...
why take the time?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.916
We know that it evolved.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.686
It's an assumption;
it's not a fact.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.322
When you're no longer
a first-year, you'll see

11:31.324 --> 11:33.091
how important facts are.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.793
Right.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.331
Each of these animals has an eye

11:40.333 --> 11:43.001
that's best selected
for its environment.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.071
It would be...

11:46.073 --> 11:48.006
cleaner... less variables...

11:48.008 --> 11:50.408
if you... had an origin.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.178
Go on.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.246
You start with one...

11:55.248 --> 11:56.748
to get to 12.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.017
But what if you had zero...

11:59.019 --> 12:01.252
a non-seeing organism...

12:01.254 --> 12:04.322
and built, genetically,
an eye from scratch,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.157
a zero to 12?

12:06.159 --> 12:09.127
It'd be a perfect proof,
unassailable.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.997
Non-seeing organisms
don't have the PAX6 gene.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.167
How do you know? Has anyone
ever checked all of them?

12:16.169 --> 12:19.738
I don't think anyone
has ever checked...

12:19.740 --> 12:21.272
all of them.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.843
You've thought of this before?

12:26.212 --> 12:27.378
Why did you look surprised?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.781
Because so have you.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.453
Okay.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.294
Who were those girls?

12:45.065 --> 12:47.365
Which girls?
The ones at the
Halloween party

12:47.367 --> 12:49.400
in the S&M outfits.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.236
S&M outfits...?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.538
I-I met one of them;
I don't know her name.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.508
I don't know her face, but
she had these most amazing eyes.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.910
So specific.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.178
Central heterochromia.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.514
Oh, reminds me.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.382
Guess what I did.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.850
What?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.919
I... figured out an improved

13:07.921 --> 13:09.220
implementation technique

13:09.222 --> 13:12.357
for Daugman's
biometrics algo.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.459
You ever feel like
when you met someone,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.060
they fill this hole
inside of you,

13:16.062 --> 13:17.362
and then when they're gone...

13:17.364 --> 13:21.299
you feel that space
painfully vacant?

13:22.334 --> 13:24.269
Are you okay, man?

13:26.372 --> 13:28.173
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.407
Are you okay?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.576
What did you just say?
Did you just...

13:31.578 --> 13:33.578
The way you talked was,
like, poetic.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.880
It was weird.
Shut the fuck up.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.016
So weird, dude,
I can't believe...

13:38.018 --> 13:39.851
Oh, shit.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.389
This guy is painfully vacant.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.391
Ian, look at him...
he's so painfully va...

13:46.393 --> 13:49.994
He's so painfully vacant.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.197
Fuck off.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.072
Can I get a-a pack of Verdict

14:01.074 --> 14:03.241
and a Powerball?

14:05.277 --> 14:08.112
How much is that?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.983
$11.11.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.184
Eleven...

14:20.026 --> 14:22.360
Lucky elevens.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.299
Thanks.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.195
Karen.
Mm-hmm?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.198
What are you doing?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.666
Five percent of all animals
don't have vision,

17:16.669 --> 17:19.037
and there are
8.7 million species.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.772
So I blasted PAX6
at the database,

17:21.775 --> 17:23.508
but nothing came up.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.143
So I started sequencing
by myself.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.244
How many did you sequence?

17:28.414 --> 17:31.816
12.
You've done 12.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.219
So how many do
you have left?

17:35.221 --> 17:39.323
Like, approximately
426,000.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.628
Are you going to write
426,000 names

17:43.630 --> 17:45.396
on the window?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.835
I'm going to find it before
I get to the end of the window.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.203
Okay.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.172
What are you doing?

17:55.441 --> 17:57.542
I'm... I'm not doing anything.

18:46.825 --> 18:50.695
You know we could be looking
forever and find nothing.

18:50.697 --> 18:55.399
Turning over rocks
and finding nothing is progress.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.059
<i>So, are you gonna tell me
where you're from?</i>

21:37.329 --> 21:38.996
So many places, I don't know.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.500
Which places?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.802
Mm...

21:44.804 --> 21:48.673
To make it short,
I was born in Argentina,

21:48.675 --> 21:52.510
and when I was 11, I moved
to France with my grandmother.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.383
And your-your parents?

22:00.452 --> 22:02.420
Next.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.026
So, what do you do?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.461
Next.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.337
Why did you sleep
with me that night?

22:20.405 --> 22:22.873
Poor judgment.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.713
I was lonely
for a long time, and...

22:31.950 --> 22:33.684
...when I saw you that night,

22:33.686 --> 22:37.555
I... I had the feeling
that I had known you.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.958
Actually, I felt like
you knew me.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.428
What do you mean?

22:45.697 --> 22:48.599
Like we are connected
from past lives.

22:49.634 --> 22:52.069
I don't believe in that.

22:54.139 --> 22:56.774
What do you believe in?

22:56.776 --> 22:59.443
I'm a scientist;
I believe in data.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.878
A scientist?
Mm-hmm.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.480
What kind of scientist?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.781
Molecular biology.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.517
I'm most fascinated
with the eye.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.985
The eye... the-the eyes?

23:07.987 --> 23:09.120
The eyes.
Why the eye?

23:09.122 --> 23:10.788
The eye is

23:10.790 --> 23:12.790
the one sticking point
that religious people use

23:12.792 --> 23:15.059
to discredit evolution.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.129
They use it as proof of a...
intelligent designer.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.964
Intelligent designer...?

23:19.966 --> 23:21.732
God.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.436
I'm looking to end the debate
once and for all with...

23:27.773 --> 23:30.474
...clear, clean facts.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.610
Data points of every stage
of eye evolution.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.614
Why are you working so hard
to disprove God?

23:36.616 --> 23:39.784
Disprove? Who proved that God
was there in the first place?

23:41.787 --> 23:45.489
Anyway,
let's get some real

23:45.491 --> 23:47.124
data points on you, okay?

23:47.126 --> 23:48.559
Be my guest.

23:48.561 --> 23:51.195
I prefer talking
about myself anyways.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.097
Okay.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.966
<i>Um, what's your favorite,
um...</i>

23:55.968 --> 23:58.436
<i>Candy?</i>

23:58.438 --> 23:59.637
<i>Strawberry Mentos.</i>

23:59.639 --> 24:01.739
<i>Food?</i>

24:01.741 --> 24:03.707
<i>Veggie burritos.</i>

24:03.709 --> 24:05.075
<i>I'm vegetarian,
you should know that.</i>

24:05.077 --> 24:09.046
<i>What's your favorite flower?</i>

24:09.048 --> 24:11.115
<i>Dandelions.</i>

24:11.117 --> 24:13.050
<i>Okay. Why?</i>

24:13.052 --> 24:16.220
<i>'Cause, they're free, wild,</i>

24:16.222 --> 24:18.656
<i>and you can't buy them.</i>

24:18.658 --> 24:21.192
<i>What's your favorite
field of study?</i>

24:21.194 --> 24:22.760
<i>The stars.</i>

24:22.762 --> 24:24.628
<i>What's your favorite animal?</i>

24:24.630 --> 24:25.996
<i>The white peacock.</i>

24:25.998 --> 24:27.965
<i>You ever see one?</i>

24:27.967 --> 24:29.467
<i>No.</i>

24:29.469 --> 24:30.801
<i>There's one in New York.</i>

24:30.803 --> 24:33.237
<i>I'll take you to see it.</i>

24:33.239 --> 24:36.540
<i>So, you're gonna see me again?</i>

24:36.542 --> 24:38.008
<i>Maybe.</i>

24:47.652 --> 24:51.789
<i>You know,
in Indian mythology,</i>

24:51.791 --> 24:53.724
<i>the white peacock symbolizes</i>

24:53.726 --> 24:56.760
<i>souls being dispersed
throughout the world.</i>

24:56.762 --> 24:59.196
<i>Did you ever think
it just symbolizes</i>

24:59.198 --> 25:02.132
<i>a lack of melanin or pigment
in the cells?</i>

25:04.769 --> 25:06.704
<i>The control subjects "T..."</i>

25:06.706 --> 25:09.106
<i>"T" as in tsunami.</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:10.574
<i>"G" as in...</i>

25:10.576 --> 25:11.576
<i>Gnome.</i>

25:11.577 --> 25:13.077
<i>"P" as in...</i>

25:13.079 --> 25:14.912
<i>Pneumonia.</i>

25:14.914 --> 25:16.080
<i>"M" as in...</i>

25:16.082 --> 25:17.281
<i>Mnemonic.</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:45.209
I start to see these elevens,
like, everywhere.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.911
Too many elevens.

25:46.913 --> 25:50.281
The amount was
so staggering, so unlikely,

25:50.283 --> 25:53.150
that I followed them.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.619
And when I followed them,
I found your eyes,

25:55.621 --> 25:58.055
which then led me to you.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.291
Because I found you
through your eyes.

26:00.293 --> 26:03.060
Also unlikely...

26:03.062 --> 26:05.162
like life itself.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.799
I know.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.801
I sent them to you.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.770
Bullshit.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.842
You know you have it.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.084
Have what?
But you're scared of it.

26:23.281 --> 26:25.249
I have what?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.358
Okay.

26:39.030 --> 26:41.031
You live in this room, right?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.199
Mm-hmm.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.134
Reality.

26:44.136 --> 26:47.805
You have a bed, you have books,

26:47.807 --> 26:51.675
um, a desk, a chair, lamps.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.144
Logic.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.980
But in this room,

26:55.982 --> 26:58.716
you have a door...

26:58.718 --> 27:00.050
to the other side.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.988
See?

27:03.990 --> 27:07.358
Light comes through.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.259
It's open

27:09.261 --> 27:14.231
just a tiny bit,
but it is open.

27:14.233 --> 27:18.202
You keep trying to close
that door because you're scared.

27:20.105 --> 27:23.140
But you won't always
be scared.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.345
What's behind the door?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.214
Besides my dirty laundry.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.776
You have to go
in to find out.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.953
You know
what I'm talking about.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.292
I have no idea.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.795
You will.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.764
You will.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.867
Oh...

27:49.869 --> 27:52.136
You want to move to my place?

27:52.138 --> 27:53.671
You have a place?

27:53.673 --> 27:56.006
Mm-hmm. Of course.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.676
Can I move in tomorrow?

28:33.211 --> 28:35.145
Is this your family?

28:35.147 --> 28:37.114
Yes, it's my grandmother.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.151
Such an eccentric beauty.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.221
And...

28:46.725 --> 28:49.893
...my parents and me
when I was a baby.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.997
Um, the white peacock.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.867
But you have
met him before.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.969
Mm!

28:58.971 --> 29:02.306
This is a proof
of the spirit world.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.341
"El Ángel de la Resurreccion."

29:04.343 --> 29:06.009
What?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.345
It's the name of the statue,
of the statue

29:08.347 --> 29:10.080
in St. Anne's Cemetery.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.315
It's in
St. Anne's Cemetery?

29:11.317 --> 29:12.850
Mm-hmm.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.152
But look at the eyes.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.821
They're alive.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.423
Yeah.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.825
It's amazing what you can do
on Photoshop these days.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.061
There's no Photoshop!

29:24.063 --> 29:29.066
The eyes appeared
just when she took the picture.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.334
Just...

29:30.336 --> 29:32.770
You're so beautiful.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.204
Let's get more boxes.

29:41.412 --> 29:44.114
19 days gestation period.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.850
She is ready.

29:46.852 --> 29:50.120
Fame, science grants,

29:50.122 --> 29:53.791
fortune await you.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.493
If you find that PAX6 gene,

29:56.495 --> 29:58.896
we'll be well on our way
to all of that.

29:58.898 --> 30:02.533
Recognition makes me
extremely nauseous.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.971
Well, it is important
that people know about the work.

30:07.973 --> 30:12.810
To me, the best thing about
living like a lab rat...

30:12.812 --> 30:15.946
is that sometimes...

30:15.948 --> 30:18.182
really rare times,

30:18.184 --> 30:21.585
you actually
discover something.

30:23.855 --> 30:27.224
On the night of a discovery,
when you're lying in bed,

30:27.226 --> 30:31.028
you are the only person in
the world that knows it's true.

30:42.941 --> 30:46.910
Can you promise
me something?

30:46.912 --> 30:48.545
Promise you something?
Mm-hmm.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.180
What?

30:50.182 --> 30:51.882
Promise.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.550
I can't promise
if you don't tell me what...

30:53.552 --> 30:55.052
Promise first.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.955
Before you tell me
what it is?
Mm-hmm.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.390
I keep my promises.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.860
Whatever, I won't tell.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.628
Promise.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.233
Okay, I promise.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.101
I want you to burn me.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.436
Burn you?

31:12.438 --> 31:14.504
I don't want to rot
in a box when I die.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.874
Oh, you mean like
cremate you.

31:16.876 --> 31:17.975
Mm, yeah.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.276
Oh, no, no.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.878
I don't want to be cremated.

31:23.481 --> 31:27.184
This is a big disagreement
I didn't know we had.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.953
Cremation
is like obliteration.

31:29.955 --> 31:32.422
I mean, what if in the future,
the scientists...

31:32.424 --> 31:36.660
what if they can reconstitute
ourselves through our DNA?

31:36.662 --> 31:39.429
I want to be clear with you.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.198
Hmm?
I don't want that.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.033
You don't want what?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.968
I don't want to be cloning.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.103
"Cl-Cloneed." Cl...

31:46.105 --> 31:47.437
"I don't want to be cloning."

31:47.439 --> 31:50.374
"Cloneed."

31:50.376 --> 31:53.343
No, but I'd reconstitute
myself first,

31:53.345 --> 31:55.545
and then I'd reconstitute you,
and then I'd ask you,

31:55.547 --> 31:57.648
"Do you want to be alive?"

31:57.650 --> 32:00.550
And then if you didn't,
I'd kill you.

32:06.090 --> 32:09.226
No, but then we could be
together forever, like, like,

32:09.228 --> 32:11.495
for real, scientifically.
You can't do...

32:11.497 --> 32:13.597
Reanimated, reconstituted.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.068
You have a hard time
letting go.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.704
Don't worry.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.307
We'll find each other again.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.219
I love your smell.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.955
What is it?

32:37.957 --> 32:39.323
I won't tell.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.457
Come on, tell me.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.627
Mm-mm. Mm.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.098
Will you marry me?

32:58.276 --> 33:00.544
Next?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.045
Can I help you?

33:02.047 --> 33:03.347
We'd like to get married.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.548
Do you have
your I.D.'s?

33:04.550 --> 33:06.550
Yeah.
Yes.

33:10.254 --> 33:13.123
Okay, first you have
to get your marriage license,

33:13.125 --> 33:14.291
so you have to
fill these out.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.459
Okay.
Okay.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.995
You're gonna have
to wait 24 hours

33:17.997 --> 33:19.529
before you can
actually get married.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.697
24 hours?!

33:20.699 --> 33:22.065
Yeah.
Why?

33:22.067 --> 33:23.533
Well, this way,
you have 24 hours

33:23.535 --> 33:25.502
to decide whether you want
to marry this young man.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.270
But I want
to marry him!

33:27.272 --> 33:29.706
In 24 hours.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.275
So...
Okay. All right. Yeah.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.479
So we can't get married today.

33:37.282 --> 33:38.782
Okay...

33:40.518 --> 33:43.153
This system really...

33:43.155 --> 33:46.390
kills the spontaneity
factor, huh?

33:46.392 --> 33:48.692
We're already married
in the spirit world.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.195
Shit.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.430
Hello?

33:53.432 --> 33:54.564
Hi.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.566
Hi.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.267
Hi.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.536
Hi. What's up?
You called, like, five times.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.771
I did.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.806
Why-why would I do that?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.808
Why might I call five times?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.443
I don't know.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.311
I was running the
electrophoretic drill...

34:08.313 --> 34:10.313
you know,
just another Tuesday...

34:10.315 --> 34:12.349
and I started
sequencing the genes

34:12.351 --> 34:16.152
of this strange worm
called <i> Eisenia fetida.</i>

34:16.155 --> 34:17.554
Go on.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.456
And, uh...

34:19.458 --> 34:22.292
I-I found the PAX6
master switch.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.228
No.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.397
Yeah.
Are you serious right now?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.632
You fucking with me?
Do you know what this means?

34:29.635 --> 34:31.301
We found an origin species,

34:31.303 --> 34:33.469
and we can build
an eye from scratch.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.306
Holy sh...!

34:38.177 --> 34:40.476
Um, uh, does it...
does it have

34:40.478 --> 34:42.344
the same amino acid sequence
as humans?

34:42.347 --> 34:43.513
I-I can't even...

34:43.514 --> 34:44.815
I can't even talk right now.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.616
I feel like
I'm gonna piss myself.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.085
Can you just come in here?

34:48.087 --> 34:49.219
Okay, I'm coming in right now.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.221
You're amazing.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.855
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.391
Who was that?

34:55.393 --> 34:56.860
That was Karen, uh...

34:56.862 --> 34:58.261
my rotating...

34:58.263 --> 35:00.464
well... my lab partner.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.501
I have to go into
the lab, right now.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.504
Do you want to come with me?
On our wedding day?

35:08.773 --> 35:10.407
It's... well, it's not...

35:10.409 --> 35:12.609
technically,
it's not our wedding day today.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.845
And we've been
married... forever

35:14.847 --> 35:17.114
in the spiritual world, right?

35:17.116 --> 35:19.249
Sofi, please,
come in with me.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.450
It's really important.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.685
Sure.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.553
Yeah?

35:23.555 --> 35:25.622
Mm. It's fine.
Let's go.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.291
Well, d... don't
be upset about it.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.160
Let's put our rings on.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.728
I don't want to;
it's bad luck.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.730
I don't believe in luck.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.200
I do believe we've
known each other

35:37.202 --> 35:40.170
since forever, though.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.438
Really?

35:41.440 --> 35:43.807
Yeah.
You know how?

35:45.176 --> 35:47.410
When the big bang
happened,

35:47.412 --> 35:49.913
all the atoms in the universe,
they were all smashed together

35:49.915 --> 35:52.883
into one little dot
that exploded outward.

35:52.885 --> 35:56.219
So my atoms and your atoms
were certainly together then,

35:56.221 --> 35:57.721
and, who knows, probably...

35:57.723 --> 36:01.424
smashed together several
times in the last 13.7

36:01.426 --> 36:03.727
billion years.

36:03.729 --> 36:07.297
So my atoms have
known your atoms...

36:07.299 --> 36:10.400
and they've always
known your atoms.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.637
My atoms have...
always loved your atoms.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.446
Let's go.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.322
Karen.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.428
Hey.
Hi.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.864
Hi. This is...
Sofi, this is Karen.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.532
Karen, this is Sofi.
Hi.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.568
She's my wife.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.804
Welcome. Um...

36:49.407 --> 36:50.640
What do you want to see?

36:50.642 --> 36:51.808
I want to see
everything.

36:51.810 --> 36:52.876
Uh...

36:52.878 --> 36:55.245
So, I have this gel.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.348
And it aligns?

36:58.350 --> 37:01.551
The alignment crossed
PAX6 proteins...

37:01.553 --> 37:04.221
98% identity.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.456
Are these the worms?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.461
They-they can't see anything.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.264
Not for long.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.252
You know, um...

37:35.254 --> 37:37.787
I should... I'm gonna
go take a shower.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.923
You've seen it.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.425
I should... take a shower,
Shower?

37:42.427 --> 37:44.728
brush my teeth...
Wait a minute,
you're gonna go

37:44.730 --> 37:46.630
right now?
Um... yeah.

37:46.632 --> 37:50.600
Yeah, I'm sure you want to show
your wife around the lab and...

37:50.602 --> 37:52.669
Okay. Are you sure?

37:54.739 --> 37:56.539
Okay. Well, uh...

37:56.541 --> 37:58.541
this is amazing.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.043
The beginning
of something...

38:00.045 --> 38:01.745
amazing.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.417
It was nice
to meet you.

38:07.419 --> 38:10.020
Amazing stuff, Karen.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.588
Bye.
Bye.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.956
Bye.

38:30.841 --> 38:33.476
What's wrong?

38:34.979 --> 38:38.048
I know something's
wrong, so...

38:38.050 --> 38:41.651
You leave me every day
to torture little worms?

38:45.756 --> 38:49.359
We're not torturing
worms... Sofi.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.061
If you're interested,

38:51.063 --> 38:53.430
we're modifying organisms.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.333
In this case,
they happen to be worms,

38:56.335 --> 38:57.867
that are blind,

38:57.869 --> 38:59.602
and we're modifying them
to have vision.

38:59.604 --> 39:03.373
You can make blind worms see?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.974
Kind of.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.043
I mean, we can now, maybe.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.547
You think that's a good idea?

39:10.549 --> 39:13.550
Do you think it's a bad idea?

39:13.552 --> 39:15.485
I think...

39:15.487 --> 39:18.054
it's dangerous to play God.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.124
Sofi, I believe
in proof.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.027
There is no proof

39:24.029 --> 39:27.530
that there is
some magical spirit...

39:27.532 --> 39:30.367
uh, that's invisible,
living above us,

39:30.369 --> 39:31.768
right on top of us...

39:31.770 --> 39:34.537
How many senses do worms have?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.439
They have two:

39:36.441 --> 39:37.941
smell...

39:37.943 --> 39:39.476
and touch.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.643
Why?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.579
So...

39:42.581 --> 39:45.048
they live without
any ability to see

39:45.050 --> 39:48.385
or even know about light, right?

39:48.387 --> 39:51.388
The notion of light
to them is...

39:51.390 --> 39:52.756
unimaginable.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.792
Yeah.

39:55.794 --> 39:56.993
But...

39:56.995 --> 39:59.062
we humans...

39:59.064 --> 40:01.598
we know...

40:01.600 --> 40:04.634
that light exists...

40:04.636 --> 40:06.770
all around them,

40:06.772 --> 40:09.806
right on top of them.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.975
They cannot
sense it, but...

40:11.977 --> 40:14.677
with a little mutation, they do.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.045
Right?

40:16.047 --> 40:17.881
Correct.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.018
So...

40:22.020 --> 40:24.788
Dr. Eye...

40:24.790 --> 40:26.790
perhaps some humans...

40:26.792 --> 40:28.491
rare humans...

40:28.493 --> 40:31.995
have mutated to have
another sense...

40:31.997 --> 40:34.964
a spirit sense...

40:34.966 --> 40:37.033
and can perceive a world

40:37.035 --> 40:39.502
that is right
on top of us...

40:39.504 --> 40:41.971
everywhere...

40:41.973 --> 40:45.942
just... like the light
on these worms.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.150
So you're a mutant.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.119
Mm-hmm.

40:57.188 --> 41:00.156
And I'm not the only one.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.740
Aah! Oh, sh...

41:17.742 --> 41:19.609
Jesus!
Are you okay?
Here, let me see.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.011
I got formaldehyde in my eye.
Get the splash kit.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.746
What is it?
Aah! Fuck!

41:23.748 --> 41:26.249
What is it? Tell me!
It's-it's... yellow!

41:26.251 --> 41:27.884
It's right over there.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.687
It's yellow. Call Karen.
Fucking call Karen now.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.889
Where's the number!
The number's
by the door.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.824
By the door.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.727
Got it.

41:46.203 --> 41:49.038
We should do this
every Friday.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.210
How many fingers
am I holding up?

41:55.913 --> 41:58.081
12.
He's not blind.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.616
So that's good.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.050
I think you're gonna be fine.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.285
Are you okay?

42:03.554 --> 42:04.834
Yeah.

42:06.824 --> 42:08.091
Okay.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.527
Thank you.
Yeah.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.529
You're gonna feel fine in...

42:12.531 --> 42:14.197
12 hours or something.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.199
I'll call tomorrow
and check in on him.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.635
Thank you.
Yeah, of course.

42:36.086 --> 42:38.087
This is funny.

42:38.089 --> 42:41.758
Yeah. It's, um...

42:42.826 --> 42:44.327
...strange.

42:45.829 --> 42:47.897
Find me.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.234
Whoa.

42:52.603 --> 42:54.604
Whoa what?

42:58.643 --> 43:00.910
We are in the middle
of two floors.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.645
We stopped.

43:04.049 --> 43:05.315
Hmm.

43:05.317 --> 43:06.950
Hmm.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.918
We should call the super.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.086
The super what?

43:10.088 --> 43:12.155
The super.
The superintendent. Um,

43:12.157 --> 43:13.890
the guy that fixes
the building.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.592
Can you call him?

43:15.594 --> 43:18.795
I don't know this guy.
I don't have his number.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.797
Of course you don't.

43:20.799 --> 43:21.931
Here.

43:24.134 --> 43:26.736
It's under "super."

43:26.738 --> 43:28.838
What?

43:28.840 --> 43:30.873
Your phone is dead.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.343
It's dead?
Yeah.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.878
Now, come on, relax.

43:35.880 --> 43:38.314
You're so irresponsible.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.917
Okay...

43:48.026 --> 43:50.259
Want me to call Karen?

43:54.832 --> 43:56.666
Don't be a child.

43:57.868 --> 44:00.937
You live in this
fairy, magical...

44:00.939 --> 44:03.973
fantasy land.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.209
It's a fucking lie,
and you know it's a lie.

44:06.211 --> 44:07.944
That's...

44:07.946 --> 44:10.947
it's a lie that you want
to believe, like a child.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.229
Like a child.

44:31.735 --> 44:33.870
Okay. Okay.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.438
Come on.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.907
What's gonna happen?
I got... I'll boost you up.

44:37.909 --> 44:39.842
No, no, no, you go first,
Come on.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.277
and you pull me up.
Sofi, come on...

44:41.279 --> 44:43.112
I'm not going first.
You go first.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.674
Look at you.
You're so scared. Come on.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.086
Be careful.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.821
Look how easy that was.

44:51.823 --> 44:53.089
Come on.

44:53.091 --> 44:55.091
Come on, let's go.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.094
Sofia, come on!

45:01.433 --> 45:03.733
Give me your hand.

45:04.768 --> 45:07.770
Give me your hand.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.105
Oh...

45:09.107 --> 45:10.387
Okay, come on.

45:43.774 --> 45:45.742
Sofi?

45:51.949 --> 45:54.150
Sofi? Sofi?

45:55.219 --> 45:58.054
Sofi? Sofi?

45:58.056 --> 45:59.489
Sofi?

46:03.128 --> 46:05.161
Sofi!

48:31.241 --> 48:32.408
Hello?

48:32.410 --> 48:34.610
Can I come over?

48:34.612 --> 48:36.312
No.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.082
Maybe.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.918
What if I bring you something

48:41.920 --> 48:44.020
that I know will
take your breath away.

48:48.458 --> 48:50.593
It has an eye.

48:50.595 --> 48:53.195
I mean, just
light-sensitive cells, but...

48:53.197 --> 48:54.397
we did it.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.632
Mutations are holding.

48:57.668 --> 48:59.936
You did it.

49:03.173 --> 49:06.509
That's the first step in
a really long process.

49:06.511 --> 49:08.511
It's gonna end
as a worm in a box

49:08.513 --> 49:10.947
if you don't get your ass
back in the lab.

49:15.385 --> 49:18.354
Why don't you
eat something.

51:06.596 --> 51:08.731
<i>He claims to have
put to rest the notion</i>

51:08.733 --> 51:12.501
<i>that the eye was made
by an intelligent designer.</i>

51:12.503 --> 51:14.737
Dr. Gray, you made some mutants
in a laboratory,

51:14.739 --> 51:16.839
and now you expect
all religious people

51:16.841 --> 51:19.408
to what, just
throw away their beliefs?

51:19.410 --> 51:21.410
Well, I... I expect
them to fight me

51:21.412 --> 51:23.112
every step of the way.

51:23.114 --> 51:24.613
But I do implore them to look

51:24.615 --> 51:27.383
at the evidence and data
that we've collected here.

51:27.385 --> 51:29.785
These specimens are
practical examples

51:29.787 --> 51:32.488
of every stage of
eye development.

51:32.490 --> 51:33.856
Dr. Ian Gray, uh,
thanks for being here.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.257
Thanks for having me.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.860
Uh, the book is
<i>The Complete Eye.</i>

51:37.862 --> 51:39.562
All right.

51:43.834 --> 51:45.401
How'd I do?

51:45.403 --> 51:47.136
Why do you do
that thing with your face?

51:47.138 --> 51:48.437
What-what do you...?

51:48.439 --> 51:50.206
That thing where you're,
like...

51:50.208 --> 51:53.275
You did nothing with your face.
It was good,
it was good.

51:53.277 --> 51:54.643
Man, you should have joined

51:54.645 --> 51:56.812
the private sector, Professor.

51:56.814 --> 51:59.548
It's-it's crazy.
Iris biometrics is...

51:59.550 --> 52:02.151
exploding
all over the world.

52:02.153 --> 52:04.520
I'll take love over
money any day.

52:04.522 --> 52:06.755
Wow, that's...
that's mature of you.

52:06.757 --> 52:09.525
You think I could
really get a job there?

52:11.129 --> 52:12.862
Thank you.

52:17.267 --> 52:18.868
You all right?

52:18.870 --> 52:20.703
Any more drinks?

52:20.705 --> 52:22.805
Uh, yeah, I just...

52:22.807 --> 52:24.840
there's a smell,
I can't place it.

52:24.842 --> 52:27.543
Maybe it's your perfume.

52:27.545 --> 52:29.478
Any more drinks?

52:29.480 --> 52:32.314
Uh, no, actually,
we'd like to know

52:32.316 --> 52:34.316
what your perfume is?
You don't
have to answer that.

52:34.318 --> 52:36.252
I'm, I'm ju...
It's Trésor.

52:36.254 --> 52:37.586
Trésor?

52:37.588 --> 52:40.456
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

52:40.458 --> 52:42.892
I'm okay with... drink.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.493
It's Trésor.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.594
It's French.

52:45.596 --> 52:46.929
Are you hitting
on the...

52:46.931 --> 52:50.332
waitress in front
of your pregnant wife?

52:50.334 --> 52:51.901
I don't know if you know this
about me, Kenny,

52:51.903 --> 52:54.370
but the gene for jealousy...
recessive.

52:54.372 --> 52:56.205
That's... that's
good, for him.

52:56.207 --> 52:59.742
I'm going to the dance floor
with my pregnant, lovely wife.

52:59.744 --> 53:01.777
I'm gonna get
her number for you.

53:01.779 --> 53:03.946
Please. Thank you.

53:06.383 --> 53:08.784
I'm so looking forward

53:08.786 --> 53:11.654
to brainwashing
this child with you.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.658
You know what
I was thinking?

53:15.660 --> 53:16.892
What?

53:20.897 --> 53:24.233
What if we turn
the garage into a lab?

53:25.635 --> 53:28.604
And the baby could be
our first test subject.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.310
That's a great idea.

53:34.312 --> 53:36.812
Is there something
ethically wrong with that?

53:40.483 --> 53:42.284
No.

53:49.693 --> 53:52.394
You know what
I want to do?

53:53.697 --> 53:55.864
I think we should leave.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.855
I'm, uh, picking up
a prescription

54:19.857 --> 54:22.391
for my wife, Karen Gray.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.777
How about if I sing to you?

54:44.414 --> 54:47.516
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶

54:48.585 --> 54:52.321
¶ Wake unto me... ¶

55:03.333 --> 55:07.336
¶ Sounds of the rude world ¶

55:07.338 --> 55:09.438
¶ Heard in the day ¶

55:10.740 --> 55:12.875
¶ Lull'd by the moonlight ¶

55:12.877 --> 55:14.977
¶ Have all pass'd away... ¶

55:16.546 --> 55:18.514
<i>Shh...</i>

55:20.684 --> 55:25.421
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶

55:25.423 --> 55:27.589
¶ Wake unto me ¶

55:29.025 --> 55:32.728
¶ Starlight and dewdrops ¶

55:32.730 --> 55:34.963
¶ Are waiting for thee... ¶

55:45.375 --> 55:49.345
¶ Say hello to the camera. ¶

55:50.980 --> 55:53.682
Sofi, come on.

55:54.751 --> 55:56.051
Be nice.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.420
Be nice.
Come on, act like a lady.

55:59.956 --> 56:02.624
Hello.
Hello.

56:02.626 --> 56:05.594
Hello.
I want you.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.830
I want you more.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.014
Don't stop.

56:28.885 --> 56:31.854
I want to know
what's turning you on.

56:50.807 --> 56:53.367
I-I...
I never do this.

57:10.860 --> 57:15.431
I sometimes think about
the cause and effect of it,

57:15.433 --> 57:19.034
and I think about how... and
I don't feel guilty for this...

57:20.069 --> 57:21.937
...but I think about how

57:21.939 --> 57:25.841
if I hadn't called you
into the lab that day...

57:27.510 --> 57:29.778
...she would...
maybe still be here,

57:29.780 --> 57:32.681
and you would be with her.

57:34.784 --> 57:38.987
Can I tell you something that
makes me feel like a monster?

57:40.723 --> 57:44.493
That day in
the elevator,

57:44.495 --> 57:47.496
Am I going to be stuck

57:47.498 --> 57:50.899
with this child
the rest of my life?

57:50.901 --> 57:54.236
And then the next moment,
she was dead.

57:55.772 --> 57:59.875
We were never gonna be...
together, Karen.

58:00.910 --> 58:02.911
I just never got...

58:02.913 --> 58:04.646
closure.

58:04.648 --> 58:07.082
I never got to say...

58:07.084 --> 58:09.051
good-bye.

58:14.090 --> 58:16.725
Kiss me.

58:45.221 --> 58:49.224
Iris scanning is a new
identification measure taken up

58:49.226 --> 58:51.226
by the more sophisticated
hospitals.

58:51.228 --> 58:53.061
We-we know
what iris scanning is.

58:53.063 --> 58:55.731
We've had it in our lab
for a... for a decade.

58:55.733 --> 58:58.567
Well, it's still new
to the general public.

58:58.569 --> 59:01.270
Now, we are not yet
legally required

59:01.272 --> 59:04.907
to scan eyes, but we
adopted the technology

59:04.909 --> 59:08.277
and use it with the
parents' consent.

59:08.279 --> 59:10.712
I-I'm fine with it.
Do you, uh...?

59:10.714 --> 59:13.949
- Scan, yeah. Do the scan.
- I dim the lights.

59:15.752 --> 59:18.220
The system is non-obtrusive,

59:18.222 --> 59:20.055
and in all actuality

59:20.057 --> 59:23.992
is just taking
photo of the eyes.

59:23.994 --> 59:25.961
There you go.
Come here, Tobias.

59:25.963 --> 59:27.729
Oh, thank you.
You got it?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.766
Y... Yes, I got it.
Thank you.

59:32.269 --> 59:34.937
What happens then is,
the computer finds

59:34.939 --> 59:37.606
a bunch of points in the
crevices of the eye...

59:37.608 --> 59:39.568
Yeah, we-we understand
how it works.

59:49.018 --> 59:50.752
Oh, forgive me.

59:50.754 --> 59:54.122
These systems are sort of new.
Can you tell?

59:55.158 --> 59:57.025
Paul Edgar Dairy?

59:57.027 --> 59:59.661
Sounds like a pirate.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:02.764
If this happens,
I'm supposed to punch in a key

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.866
and reboot.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.872
Wait.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.916
There we go.

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:22.918
So I'll just
put in his info.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.054
What is his name?

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:28.790
I like Paul Edgar Dairy.
It's fine.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.093
Tobias... George Gray.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:33.161
After his grandfather.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.671
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Ian Gray?

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:45.073
It is.
My name is Dr. Simmons.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:48.076
I work in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich hospital

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:51.013
where you and your wife
gave birth in July.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:53.849
Y-Yeah, yeah.
Is every... everything okay?

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:56.752
Yes, everything's okay.
Please don't be alarmed.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.754
We would, however,
like to run

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.390
a few simple tests
on Tobias.

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:05.293
His test results may suggest,
although highly unlikely,

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.230
the... the possibility
of early autism.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:11.233
You know I'm a doctor.
What test results?

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.735
The... We've pinpointed...
Uh...

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.304
Can you hold on
a moment, please?

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.274
Karen, listen to this.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.109
Yeah.

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.311
We've pinpointed
an array of molecular compounds

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:25.013
that appear in the urine

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.149
of children with autism...

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:29.184
and Tobias showcased

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.753
a few of them.
I promise it's unlikely,

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:35.757
but worth checking out,
and we have very simple,

01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:38.794
non-obtrusive tests,
and we'll be done in an hour.

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.996
What was your name
and affiliation?

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.464
Dr. Janet Simmons.

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:45.000
I run a research lab
on child autism

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:47.803
in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich hospital.

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:50.272
Simmons, you said?
Janet Simmons.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:53.375
Our clinic is in Stamford,
not too far from there.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.445
It's important
to check this soon.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:57.979
There's...

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.283
no alarming rush, but...
we could see him today.

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:03.285
Okay. Thank you.
You'll hear from us.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.898
Tobias.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.401
Look here. Look here.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:38.019
I'm not sure I understand

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:39.788
how this is testing for autism.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.891
The blood and urine tests will
check for molecular compounds.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.026
This test is
purely perceptual,

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.195
tracking the child's
eye movements

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:50.031
and attractions.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.425
Okay, that's enough. I'm...
Yeah. The test is over.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:35.604
If you are calling regarding

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:37.172
an existing child,

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.608
please enter your seven-digit
session number.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.379
This Dr. Simmons
is up to something.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.581
Child autism, my ass.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.350
I keep running through
her studies.

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:51.386
What was she doing?
Two images side by side.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.622
Two images,
similar but different.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:55.323
Tobias would look
at one or the other.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.592
Do you remember anything
specific about the images?

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.028
Something connected
to something?

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.297
Something we could look up?

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:05.133
There was a...
farmhouse.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:09.938
There was, um...

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.140
Dan's Diner in Boise, Idaho.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:13.642
Whatever that means.

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.579
Well, that's a real place.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.305
Hello.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:44.940
What can I get you?

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:47.409
Um, just a cup of coffee.

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:49.377
Sure thing.

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.385
I'm not from around here.

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:59.554
I was wondering, uh,
is there anything interesting

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:01.256
in town to see?

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.557
Not much around
these parts.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.492
Unless you, uh,
fancy visiting some cows

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.094
down at the dairy farm.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.296
There's a dairy farm?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.698
Mm-hmm.
That'll be a dollar.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.066
Oh.

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.335
Of course.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.170
Where is the dairy
farm located?

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:17.238
Uh, take a left,
about two miles down the road.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.707
Can't miss it.

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:33.254
We'll have 'em through
in a moment.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:34.689
O-Okay.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:35.691
Come on!

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:42.063
Is this the dairy farm?

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:43.999
Indeed it is.

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.302
These are milking cows?

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:48.770
These are meat cows,
not milking cows.

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.338
I'm Julie Dairy.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.539
This is my family's farm.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.242
Julie Dairy?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.244
Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.545
Are you related to him?

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.682
Yes, he's my father.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.553
Is he here?

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:08.423
You're clearly not
with the biography association.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.524
The, um, I'm sorry.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.192
I don't follow.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.762
Some documentary crew came
through here a few months ago,

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.231
wanting to do a story
on the great Paul Edgar Dairy,

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:18.533
the only black farmer in Boise.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.502
They took some pictures.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:23.338
I liked the story, and
they said they'd follow up.

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:27.042
You okay?

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.347
How you doing there?

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.184
I'm okay.

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:38.086
I'm just, uh, having a moment

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:39.621
of déjà vu.

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:41.456
Can we fetch you some water?

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.391
Or a cup of tea?

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.828
I'd really love to meet Paul,
if that was possible.

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:52.634
What if we just start at
the beginning and break it down?

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:55.437
In the hospital,
Tobias's eyes come up as a match

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:57.372
with Paul Edgar Dairy,
which is not correct,

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.307
because Tobias has blue eyes

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:00.775
and Paul Edgar Dairy
has brown eyes.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:04.145
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:05.780
It's based on
the unique crypts,

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.749
furrows and shapes
in the texture.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.252
So maybe Tobias and Paul
have the same iris pattern.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.720
Statistically impossible.

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.090
Second data point.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:17.425
Tobias and Paul have
some kind of connection.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.627
It's not our test,
so we don't know.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.729
And the third data point
is that

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:25.600
Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.569
Was conceived.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:31.206
Was conceived,
because Tobias is born

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.374
in July,
and Paul Edgar Dairy dies

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:35.477
in September 2012; that's...

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.544
...that's ten months.
Okay, what-what are you guys

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:37.879
talking about right now?

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.481
This... you guys sound
like crazy people.

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:41.649
Okay? What is this
connection referencing?

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.252
Doctor...
Ja... Dr. Simmons.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.420
From Yale.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.154
She did this test on Tobias.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:48.490
Dr. Simmons?

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:49.890
From Yale?

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:52.460
She's one-one of five people
who have access

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.362
to the eye database.
What?

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.599
My company owns a patent
on iris biometrics

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.435
and consolidate all their
data into one database.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:03.171
And Simmons is one of five
people that have access.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.173
But you have access
to it, too.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.640
Sort of.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.609
I can find the
iris code, okay?

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:10.678
Run it and see
if it's in the system,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.580
and then check the IP address

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.349
and check-check when
and where it was registered.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.517
I can do that.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.152
How do you do that?

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:18.419
Look into that.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.888
Okay, other eye.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.158
All right.
Okay.

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:27.761
So I can't get your name
or biographicals,

01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:29.863
but I can see that
you are in the system.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:32.300
Amazing.
Right?

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.903
And that...

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.304
you were registered

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.705
at the lab in 2005,

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.267
and the same should be
for Karen and myself.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.511
What are you thinking, Karen?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.846
Well, check this out.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:48.483
So Paul and Tobias

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.618
have the same iris patterns,
let's just say,

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.252
and there's some sort
of connection.

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.822
So the next logical step
in our scientific inquiry

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:58.293
is to find someone

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:01.229
that we do know
who's a duplicate in the system.

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:02.897
Like a family member
who has died.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:04.632
That's it.
We need another match.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:07.268
Guys, this is
statistically impossible.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.336
You're not gonna find anything.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.504
Can you get a scan

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:10.772
from a photo?

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:12.640
It has to be high-res
and in focus.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:13.942
Technically,
I can do it, but...

01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:17.345
I have hundreds
of high-res photos

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:18.746
of people's eyes.
All right.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:19.914
You can scan these.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.483
Give me the hard drive.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:24.919
This is ridiculous.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:26.487
Who do you want me to run?

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.489
Hmm, run my father.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.924
Tobias George Gray.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.893
All right.
He died two years ago.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.465
He's in the system, and...

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:39.467
and he's registered

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:41.469
- at Heathrow 2006.
- Okay.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.770
That makes sense.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:45.306
He-he was traveling there
frequently.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:47.609
Try, um, my Uncle Basil.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.437
He died seven years
ago of cancer.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.015
All right.

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.450
Not found.

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:56.851
Try your grandparents.
My grandparents.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.353
Yeah.
Bev and Barry.

01:10:58.355 --> 01:11:00.321
Bev...

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.658
She's in the system.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.860
Registered...

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:08.696
at Schiphol Airport,
Amsterdam, in 1998.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.598
How many people are
in the database?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.500
There's, like,
hundreds of millions.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.269
There's a billion soon.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:15.470
Try my grandparents.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:17.338
Okay.
Right there.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.840
Judy is in the system.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:22.043
She was registered
in a nursing home in New Haven

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:23.845
in 2009.
And Malcolm?

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.713
Malcolm...

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:26.814
Not found.
Not registered.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.285
All right, so anybody else?

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.555
Sofi.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:40.361
Okay, try-try Sofi.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:41.596
Okay.

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:43.865
Sofi.

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.777
She's in the system.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.011
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:58.913
She was probably scanned

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.515
when she came through Customs.

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:03.084
No. It says that...

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:05.920
the IP address coordinates
say that she was scanned

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:08.056
in a community center
in Delhi, India.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:10.792
She must have traveled there.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:12.593
Three months ago?

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.964
That doesn't make any sense.

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.066
That's not right.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.339
It's an error.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:28.042
It's only the seventh one
we tried.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.611
I need to get some air.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:33.748
What the fuck
is happening?

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.697
Did you put him to bed?

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.665
Yeah.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.108
You should go to India.

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.182
I can't go to India.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.954
Can't or won't?

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:50.091
India is not
Boise, Idaho, Karen.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.827
There is someone there
with Sofi's exact iris pattern.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.565
The eyes and the brain
are connected.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.001
If-if the cellular structure
in the eye

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.936
is reoccurring
from person to person,

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.005
then maybe something
in the brain

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:05.540
carries over as well,

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:08.142
like a neurological link...

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:11.746
Maybe the eye really is
some kind of...

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:14.515
window to the soul.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:16.184
Soul, Karen? Soul?

01:14:16.186 --> 01:14:19.620
Is my wife really using
the word "soul"?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.023
Like you hold
any validity in that?

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.758
Call it whatever you want
to call it.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.626
Dr. Simmons was testing
a memory connection

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:29.163
between our son
and Paul Edgar Dairy.

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:32.133
And it wasn't our test,
but you can go to India,

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.502
and you can find this person
with Sofi's eyes,

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:35.703
and you can do the same.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:37.038
I can't go there.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.739
It's just India.
Why can't you make...

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:40.141
Not India. I can't go there!

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.609
I can't go back there!

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:43.478
I can't go back
to that part of my life!

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.712
I can't do it!

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:00.761
I gotta just let it go.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:19.080
The man I married...

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:21.749
I don't think he would let
his own grief,

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.085
even if it was overwhelming,

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:26.187
get in the way
of what could potentially be

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.222
the greatest
scientific discovery

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.057
the world has ever seen.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.962
This is bigger than you.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.931
It's bigger than me.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.934
It's bigger than Sofi.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.169
Then-then maybe you should go.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.272
I would...

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:48.175
but I-I didn't know Sofi.

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:49.977
It's a false positive,
you understand?

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:51.846
It's an error;
it has to be an error.

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:54.749
It's st... it's a statistically
impossible data point.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:00.254
If I drop this phone
a thousand times,

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:02.123
a million times,

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:04.559
and one time it doesn't fall,

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.861
just once,

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.963
it hovers...

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:10.798
in the air...

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:15.303
...that is an error
that's worth looking at.

01:16:15.305 --> 01:16:18.272
You're so fucking stubborn.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.229
Technology has barely touched

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:44.031
Mira Devi's daily life.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:45.299
In her hut, muscle,

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:47.868
not machines,
gets the chores done.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.870
That is about to change for Mira

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:52.139
and perhaps millions like her.

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:53.207
At this center,

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.242
<i>her irises are scanned</i>

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:56.377
<i>with biometric devices.</i>

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:58.713
<i>They're uploaded and then sent</i>

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.381
<i>to a massive server.</i>

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.817
<i>Once this information
is processed,</i>

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.687
<i>out comes a 12-digit number
for her and her only.</i>

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.723
<i>India's unique
identification program</i>

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.725
<i>started just a year ago.</i>

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:12.326
<i>If it succeeds,</i>

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.830
<i>India will become the
first country in the world</i>

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:17.798
<i>using biometric data
for identity purposes</i>

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.767
<i>on a national scale.</i>

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.422
Whoa.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.831
First time to India?

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.035
It is, actually.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:55.703
Yeah.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.171
Darryl Mackenzie.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.073
Uh, Dr. Ian Gray.

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:00.808
Oh, "Doctor."

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.110
Well.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:06.047
Two men, both doing good work.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:08.115
What do you do?

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.818
Well, I'm in sales,
but, uh...

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.722
...also do The Man's work.

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.260
The Lord's work.

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.695
Oh.

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:22.730
Uh, of course.

01:18:25.435 --> 01:18:27.702
Good night, Dr. Gray.

01:18:27.704 --> 01:18:28.984
Uh, have a good night.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.106
Hope our paths
cross again.

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:15.950
Hello.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:18.219
Uh, can I help you?

01:19:18.221 --> 01:19:20.087
You seem like the boss
of this place.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.156
Boss? No, circus manager,
more like it.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.457
I'm Priya Varma.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.859
How can I help you?

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:26.026
I'm Dr. Ian Gray.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:27.795
I'm visiting from America.

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:31.232
I have a very strange request.

01:19:31.234 --> 01:19:32.967
Yes?

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:35.069
I'm looking for someone

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:37.037
who was scanned here
a while back.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:39.473
The thing is,
I-I don't have their name.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:42.243
All I have is a picture
of their eyes.

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.516
This is what their
eyes look like.

01:19:48.518 --> 01:19:50.851
They may not be
this exact color.

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:52.453
Uh...

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.489
Why are you looking for her?

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.057
Is she in some kind of trouble?

01:19:57.059 --> 01:19:58.859
Her?

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:00.494
Uh, no, of course not.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:01.929
She's not in trouble.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.998
She's-she's incredibly special.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.267
So you do recognize them?

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.569
I do, if it is
who I think it is,

01:20:08.571 --> 01:20:10.504
but why are you looking for her?

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.473
Here's another photo.

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:16.443
Okay, um,
this doesn't make sense.

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:17.845
These are her eyes,

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:20.147
but this isn't her face
around them.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.890
That's exactly why
I'm looking for her.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.255
Salomina.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:29.423
Salomina?
Yeah.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.860
Sweet girl, uh,
very smart girl.

01:20:32.862 --> 01:20:35.996
But, uh,
I haven't seen her recently.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.532
When was the last time
you saw her?

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:41.101
Uh, a few months ago.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.206
Could you help me find her?

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.907
Um...

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:49.543
I could make a donation
to the community center.

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:52.112
I mean, I'm-I'm going
to make a donation

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:53.948
to the community center.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:56.517
I don't want to sound crass,
like I'm bribing you,

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.385
but I am kind of bribing you.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:00.087
No, no, no, of course.

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:02.890
I mean, of course, any donation
would help the center.

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:05.092
Uh...

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:06.927
It's very important.

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:08.896
Please.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.532
Okay.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.635
You meet me tomorrow at 12:00

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:17.938
at the Okhla market, okay?

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:46.567
All right, I-I'll take a...

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.535
You want me to take
a photo of you?

01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:52.306
You want to see?

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.944
You see? Okay.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:58.045
Hello.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.519
I almost didn't come.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:07.354
Yeah, I was worried.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:09.423
What changed your mind?

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.958
I, um...

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.593
I did some research on you.

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.662
Uh-oh.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.331
Come.

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:25.439
Hello.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.107
Do all these children...

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:29.643
do they eventually end up
at the community center or...

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:31.979
Some do,

01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:34.081
but there are over
one million people

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:37.084
living in this
30-block radius alone.

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.986
According to the registrar,

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:41.288
Salomina and her parents
live here.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.958
Somebody's here... I'm gonna
ask this lady here.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.726
Okay.

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:51.846
...Salomina.
Ah, Salomina...

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.152
What's wrong?

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.554
What'd she say?

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:22.396
<i>She could be living
like a stray dog.</i>

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:24.064
She's totally alone.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.433
Her mother's dead;
her father's dead.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:29.570
She knows the address
of the community center,

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.740
but Priya said she hasn't
been there in weeks.

01:23:32.742 --> 01:23:35.642
There's a million people living
in a ten-block radius.

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.312
It's gonna be impossible
to find her.

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.550
Well, you shouldn't give up.

01:23:43.552 --> 01:23:45.185
You flew halfway
around the world.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.453
You should keep looking.

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:49.723
At least give it a few days.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:51.759
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.728
Good night.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.497
Bye.

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:05.706
What am I doing here?

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:36.470
You're mad.

01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:38.705
It's a smoke signal.

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:41.708
Someone she knows will see it.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:45.079
I'm glad you didn't
put my number up there.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.520
Hello?

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:54.655
Hello?

01:24:54.657 --> 01:24:56.723
Hi, yes?

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:59.159
Yeah, my niece has eyes like
the picture board, cash reward.

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:01.128
Are they just like the ones
in the picture?

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.130
Yes, I think so.

01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:04.298
Like, exactly?

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.399
Uh, very much so.

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:06.633
How old is your niece?

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:07.801
Eighteen.

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:09.770
My other niece is 15.

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:12.873
Oh, no, um, sorry.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.274
Thank you, no.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.642
Sorry, wrong person.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.111
Bye.

01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:25.619
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.491
Do you speak English?

01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:31.792
Yes, I do.

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:34.495
I'm sorry,
what-what were you saying?

01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:37.431
I have the eyes you took up
the advertisement for.

01:25:37.433 --> 01:25:38.732
How old are you?

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.234
Twenty-four.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:41.835
No, sorry.

01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:43.871
The person I'm looking for
is much younger.

01:25:43.873 --> 01:25:45.372
No, thank you for calling.

01:25:45.374 --> 01:25:46.507
Sorry.

01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:01.722
Very good!

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:03.590
I'm the best!
I'm the very best?

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.225
I'm the very best.

01:26:05.227 --> 01:26:06.727
Very good.

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:20.440
Dr. Gray, are you...
are you religious?

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.878
Am I religious?

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.947
I thought you researched me.

01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:28.649
I'm not religious.

01:26:28.651 --> 01:26:30.584
Why not?

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:35.756
Religion is based
on scripture written by men

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:37.457
thousands of years ago.

01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:40.727
Those beliefs can't be
changed or challenged.

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:41.929
They're fixed.

01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:43.363
In science,

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.732
great thinkers
have written things

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:47.401
very long ago,

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:50.771
but every generation
improves upon them.

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:52.806
The words are not holy.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:55.742
Einstein is a brilliant man,
but he's not our god.

01:26:57.478 --> 01:27:01.281
He's one step in the evolution
of knowledge,

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.584
but we always continue
to step forward.

01:27:03.586 --> 01:27:04.818
You know...

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.487
a scientist once asked
the Dalai Lama,

01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:10.524
"What would you do
if something scientific

01:27:10.526 --> 01:27:13.427
disproved your
religious beliefs?"

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:15.629
And he said,
after much thought,

01:27:15.631 --> 01:27:17.698
"I would look
at all the papers.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.533
"I'd take a look
at all the research

01:27:19.535 --> 01:27:22.803
"and really try to
understand things.

01:27:22.805 --> 01:27:24.638
"And in the end, if it was clear

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.675
"that the scientific evidence
disproved my spiritual beliefs,

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:32.446
I would change my beliefs."

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:34.414
That's a good answer.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.786
Ian...

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:44.625
...what would you do
if something spiritual

01:27:44.627 --> 01:27:47.928
disproved
your scientific beliefs?

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:18.025
Hello, love.

01:28:18.027 --> 01:28:20.327
The bank called today.

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:22.296
They said that $2,000 a day

01:28:22.298 --> 01:28:23.997
is going to some sketchy
Planet India company.

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:25.465
It's, like, 20k already.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.534
What's going on?

01:28:27.536 --> 01:28:28.969
I put up a billboard.

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.704
I-I know it sounds
a bit extreme,

01:28:30.706 --> 01:28:32.039
but it's all I could think of.

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.941
Ian, it's been weeks.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:37.477
I think you should come back.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.682
Karen, what-what happened

01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:44.484
to turning over rocks
and finding nothing is progress?

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.620
I'm down with
the big picture of all this.

01:28:46.622 --> 01:28:48.955
I'm the one
who wanted you to go.

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:51.892
But failed experiments
are not unknown to us, right?

01:28:51.894 --> 01:28:53.360
We regroup.

01:28:53.362 --> 01:28:54.828
We look for more matches.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.364
We try again.

01:28:57.366 --> 01:28:59.499
Please come home.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.596
Do you speak English?

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:38.465
A little.

01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:39.666
A little?

01:30:39.668 --> 01:30:42.469
Yes.

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.471
What's your name?

01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:45.705
Salomina.

01:30:45.707 --> 01:30:47.040
Salomina?

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:49.509
Yes.

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:51.044
Salomina,

01:30:51.046 --> 01:30:52.946
I-I'm Ian.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.449
My name is Ian.

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:58.118
Are you hungry?

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.519
Yes.

01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:01.488
- You are?
- Yes.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:05.091
Come on.

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:06.993
Let's get you some food.

01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:08.962
Come on.

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.599
Priya, I found her.

01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:14.501
Where are you?
I'm going to the hotel.

01:31:14.503 --> 01:31:16.036
Um, hey!

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:17.537
Can you meet me there?

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.506
Listen, I'll be
right there, okay?

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.660
What's your favorite food?

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:43.096
Strawberry.

01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:45.665
Strawberry?
Just strawberry?

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.875
What's your favorite color?

01:31:54.877 --> 01:31:59.513
Pink, purple, blue and green.

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:01.715
Pink, purple... blue and green?
Blue and green.

01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:02.916
That's so many.

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:05.185
See my finger?
Can you follow it?

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:08.188
Very good.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:11.024
Very good. Very good.

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:12.158
Very good.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.663
You okay?
You comfortable?

01:32:49.665 --> 01:32:51.665
You okay?
Yes.

01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:00.740
Are you there?
Yeah.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:10.016
I want to show you something
that will take your breath away.

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:24.130
Karen, this is Salomina.

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:26.700
Salomina, this is Karen.

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.906
I need my lab partner.

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:36.743
Okay. Yeah.

01:33:36.745 --> 01:33:39.179
I'm ready.

01:33:39.181 --> 01:33:44.618
Okay, so, Salomina,
it's a very easy game.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.987
I'm going to show you
three things, and you pick

01:33:46.989 --> 01:33:48.288
the one that's
your favorite.

01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:49.823
Okay.
You understand?

01:33:49.825 --> 01:33:51.091
Yes.
Okay.

01:33:51.093 --> 01:33:53.627
Commencing experiment one.

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:55.895
Memory connection
between subjects

01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.263
with identical iris patterns.

01:33:57.265 --> 01:33:58.398
Got it.

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:02.035
Salomina.

01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:04.371
"S" as in...
Shut the front door.

01:34:05.707 --> 01:34:07.807
"A" as in...
Amazing.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:10.010

"N" as in...

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:23.790
No way this is true.

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:25.959

Delta,

01:35:32.127 --> 01:35:34.961
incorrect, but it...
it's not a good one.

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:43.403
Echo, incorrect.

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:44.838
Sort of.

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:47.440
Okay.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.250

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.295
What's the tally?

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:52.932
44 percent.

01:37:52.934 --> 01:37:56.236
Which is, um,
a touch above random

01:37:56.238 --> 01:38:00.640
by an unfortunately
standard margin.

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:09.949
How do you feel?

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:15.989
I think numbers don't lie.

01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:19.425
I didn't ask what you think;
I asked what you feel.

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:24.297
I feel...

01:38:24.299 --> 01:38:26.399
kind of foolish.

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:34.574
I'll see you soon.

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:36.276
Okay.

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:46.019
I make bad test?

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:48.588
What?

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:51.257
I make bad test?

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:52.525
No.

01:38:52.527 --> 01:38:54.160
No, you did fine.

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:55.662
You did perfect.

01:38:55.664 --> 01:38:59.699
It's just a stupid test.
