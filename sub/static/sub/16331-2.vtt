Hiding in the dark.

00:15.566 --> 00:16.966
(phone ringing)

00:16.968 --> 00:17.967
Hello.

00:17.969 --> 00:19.168
I thought I was dreaming.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.038
(static)

00:26.311 --> 00:28.044
Do you see her?

00:31.382 --> 00:33.049
I didn't think
it could get any worse.

00:33.051 --> 00:35.117
(calling):
Hey!

00:45.797 --> 00:47.029
(screaming)

00:48.299 --> 00:51.000
(screaming continues)

00:55.273 --> 00:57.606
I am the queen of every hive.

00:57.608 --> 01:01.610
I am the fire on every hill.

01:01.612 --> 01:03.479
I am the shield over every head.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.649
I am the spear of battle.

01:06.651 --> 01:07.917
Who but I am both the tree

01:07.919 --> 01:09.251
and the lightning
that strikes it.

01:09.253 --> 01:10.987
(screaming)

01:10.989 --> 01:13.055

01:50.661 --> 01:53.129

01:53.131 --> 01:56.966
Or what it'd take
for me just to survive.

01:56.968 --> 01:59.668
THE BUTCHER: This deserter was
found at the edge of the wood

01:59.670 --> 02:03.005
with our provisions stolen
from the storehouse.

02:03.007 --> 02:06.475
Justice demands penance
for his betrayal.

02:06.477 --> 02:08.878
For he is but a cloven beast,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.514
rotting in the mire and muck,

02:11.516 --> 02:15.718
as unclean
as his festering soul.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.852
(muffled screams)

02:16.854 --> 02:18.888
Speak, pig, speak!

02:18.890 --> 02:20.956
(screaming)

02:23.895 --> 02:26.896
Let him be purified.

02:26.898 --> 02:27.930

02:55.426 --> 02:57.126
(car engine idling)

02:59.363 --> 03:00.930
(gasps)

03:01.933 --> 03:04.733
Lee brought her to the hospital.

03:04.735 --> 03:06.936
And when she woke up,
Shelby told the police

03:06.938 --> 03:11.107
a lot of wild stories...

03:11.109 --> 03:15.077
about when she got
to the human sacrifice.

03:15.079 --> 03:17.079
They sent an officer out
to investigate,

03:17.081 --> 03:20.116
but they couldn't find anything.

03:20.118 --> 03:22.718
They also told the nurses
to take some blood

03:22.720 --> 03:25.988
to check and see
if Shelby was on drugs.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.757
Hallucinogens.

03:28.759 --> 03:30.392
She was clean.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.569
(quietly):
Bam.
(laughs)

03:44.976 --> 03:47.009
I like my teddy bear.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.079
I should have been
there to protect you

03:50.081 --> 03:51.747
from whatever this was.

03:51.749 --> 03:53.315
I'm sorry.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.084
But I'm here now,

03:55.086 --> 03:57.186
and we will find
somewhere else to stay.

03:57.188 --> 03:58.821
I promise you that.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.222
No.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.027
I think it was
one of the mountain men.

04:05.029 --> 04:07.296
The whole thing was
an elaborate hoax.

04:07.298 --> 04:09.965
They are desperate
to scare us away, Matt.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.267
Look at me.

04:11.269 --> 04:12.301
(sighs)

04:12.303 --> 04:15.638
We can't let them.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.840
We can't leave.

04:17.842 --> 04:21.043
Not when every cent we have
is tied up in that house.

04:21.045 --> 04:23.312
<i> If it was a fight they wanted,</i>

04:23.314 --> 04:25.948
it was a fight
they were gonna get.

04:35.626 --> 04:37.193
Looking back,
I understand why the court

04:37.195 --> 04:40.062
gave Mason full custody.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.864
(sighs)

04:41.866 --> 04:44.166
What kind of mother
does the things I did

04:44.168 --> 04:45.968
during those times?

04:47.905 --> 04:51.073
It's my great shame;
I hate myself for it.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.010
<i> I didn't want to bring her</i>
<i> to the house.</i>

04:55.012 --> 04:58.247
<i> Not with everything</i>
<i> that was going on.</i>

05:01.185 --> 05:03.819
(SUV door closes)

05:03.821 --> 05:05.854
Mama says this was a farmhouse.

05:05.856 --> 05:08.891
Where's the chickens
and the pigs and stuff?

05:08.893 --> 05:11.727
Come on, baby.

05:11.729 --> 05:16.165
LEE:<i> But I was really trying</i>
<i> to reconnect with Flora,</i>

05:16.167 --> 05:17.933

05:17.935 --> 05:20.836
<i> that special</i>
<i> mother-daughter bond.</i>

05:22.907 --> 05:24.373
Bye, Daddy.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.242
LEE:
<i>I figured if I kept her inside,</i>

05:26.244 --> 05:30.246
<i> and kept a close eye on her,</i>
<i> it would be all right.</i>

05:30.248 --> 05:32.081
(lock clicks)

05:34.952 --> 05:37.052
Ah! Good one.

05:37.054 --> 05:38.254
(laughs)

05:38.256 --> 05:40.256
Hey, you hungry?

05:40.258 --> 05:41.924
Okay.

05:41.926 --> 05:43.959
I'll be right back.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.803
You can put
my little girl anywhere,

05:54.805 --> 05:56.739
and she will make herself
at home.

05:56.741 --> 05:59.875
She will make any place
her place.

06:05.983 --> 06:07.916
(Lee chuckles)

06:07.918 --> 06:10.986
FLORA (quietly):
She's gonna hurt us?

06:13.057 --> 06:14.990
(Flora continues
talking quietly in distance)

06:14.992 --> 06:16.792
LEE:
Baby?

06:16.794 --> 06:19.862
FLORA: If I give you my doll,
will she stay away?

06:21.832 --> 06:23.599
(sighs)

06:23.601 --> 06:25.634
(Flora continues
talking quietly)

06:29.407 --> 06:31.473
(Flora talking quietly)

06:35.680 --> 06:38.280
(chuckles)
Hey, baby.

06:38.282 --> 06:40.649
Who are you talking to?

06:40.651 --> 06:41.984
Priscilla.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.652
She's my friend.

06:45.923 --> 06:47.022
(chuckles)

06:49.260 --> 06:53.162
I heard this happens a lot
with children of divorce.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.030
They start making things up.

06:55.032 --> 06:58.000
Acting out.

06:58.002 --> 07:01.036
It broke my heart to think
I had done this to her.

07:01.038 --> 07:04.273
So what were you
and Priscilla talking about?

07:04.275 --> 07:05.841
Or is that a secret?

07:05.843 --> 07:07.843
She's gonna make
a bonnet for me

07:07.845 --> 07:09.545
just like hers
if we help her.

07:09.547 --> 07:12.047
Oh. A bonnet.

07:12.049 --> 07:14.950
Help her do what?

07:14.952 --> 07:16.919
Make it stop.

07:18.456 --> 07:20.155
Make what stop?

07:20.157 --> 07:22.925
She said she's tired
of all the blood.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.966
(glass shatters)

07:33.003 --> 07:35.304
(exhales)
Stay right here.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.117
(wind whooshing softly)

07:54.024 --> 07:55.991
¶ ¶

08:13.711 --> 08:15.711
What's your sister thinking?

08:15.713 --> 08:18.080
Uh, she wants to see her kid.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.349
You know how Mason is.

08:20.351 --> 08:23.051
She don't want to give him
a reason to keep her away.

08:23.053 --> 08:26.755
She thinks
I'm full of shit.

08:26.757 --> 08:30.592
She knows you're under
a lot of pressure.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.195
She knows
I'm not lying.

08:33.197 --> 08:35.397
She was in the basement
with me when those inbreds

08:35.399 --> 08:37.232
came into our home
and hung those things.

08:37.234 --> 08:39.935
I know.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.970
I agree. We're not gonna
lose our life savings

08:41.972 --> 08:43.739
on account of
these assholes.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.808
We fight.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.580
At least until
we can sell.

08:51.582 --> 08:54.283
Hey.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.485
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

08:57.621 --> 09:00.055
We might not
have a choice.

09:00.057 --> 09:01.123
Good night.

09:13.003 --> 09:16.171
It was easier to believe that.

09:16.173 --> 09:20.976
I mean...
the alternative was scary.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.912
Someone didn't want us
in that house,

09:23.914 --> 09:25.948
and they were gonna make
damn sure that we left

09:25.950 --> 09:27.616

Shelby, what are you doing?

09:37.928 --> 09:39.161
Someone's outside.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.096
What?
Yeah, I'm going out there.

09:41.098 --> 09:43.165
Are you crazy?
No. I'm not crazy,
I'm pissed off.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.902
I'm not gonna sit here cowering

I wanted them to know

11:03.681 --> 11:07.082
You hear about people getting

11:32.409 --> 11:35.177
Hey. You okay?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.660
SHELBY:

11:51.662 --> 11:55.163

(Matt grunting)

12:10.681 --> 12:12.748
You okay?

12:14.785 --> 12:18.086
There was something demonic
about it.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.622
Matt called the police, and
we directed them to the spot.

12:20.624 --> 12:23.258
<i> This time,</i>
<i> the cops had to believe us.</i>

12:23.260 --> 12:24.826

What if the fire had spread?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.628
What if our house
had burned down?

12:26.630 --> 12:27.829
Would you have
even bothered?

12:27.831 --> 12:29.364
Hey, we're sending
units around

12:29.366 --> 12:31.933
to track down Ishmael
Polk and his sons.

12:31.935 --> 12:34.870
Once we find them, we'll
bring them in for questioning.

12:34.872 --> 12:36.371
Questioning?

12:36.373 --> 12:38.273
Is that the best
you can do?

12:38.275 --> 12:40.776
Once they're out, they're just
gonna come back again.

12:40.778 --> 12:42.477
Who knows
what they'll do next time?

12:42.479 --> 12:45.347
There is nothing protecting us
from retaliation.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.617
If you let these people come
after us again, we will have

12:48.619 --> 12:50.152
no choice but to go public.

12:50.154 --> 12:52.354
Oh, I'm putting a squad
car in your driveway.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.022
You'll have 24-hour protection

12:54.024 --> 12:56.391
until we know
what we're dealing with.

12:56.393 --> 12:58.293
MATT:
<i> Shelby was fierce.</i>

12:58.295 --> 12:59.528
<i> I almost felt</i>

12:59.530 --> 13:01.296
sorry for the cop.

13:01.298 --> 13:04.066
But the police protection
was long overdue.

13:04.068 --> 13:07.869
We felt like we could finally
relax and get some sleep.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.472

Mm. No.

Please stop.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.524

You'll take it and like it.

What the hell is this?!

14:07.931 --> 14:09.931
What's the trouble?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.967
Margaret refuses
to take her medicine.

14:11.969 --> 14:13.935
Who are you people?!

14:13.937 --> 14:14.970
Is that true, Margaret?

14:14.972 --> 14:16.938
It makes me ill.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.406
Was that back talk?

14:18.408 --> 14:19.241
(whimpers)

14:19.243 --> 14:20.809
It was.

14:20.811 --> 14:22.144
(whimpering)

14:25.415 --> 14:27.048
(whimpering)

14:27.050 --> 14:28.617
You've been warned.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.188
(women laughing)

14:34.925 --> 14:37.826
I thought I was dreaming.

14:41.165 --> 14:43.999
I had to be dreaming.

14:44.001 --> 14:46.568
(giggling)

14:46.570 --> 14:49.571
(women laughing)

14:49.573 --> 14:51.106
"M" is for Margaret!

14:51.108 --> 14:53.775
(laughter)
(lights buzzing)

14:53.777 --> 14:55.477
(gasps)

15:07.991 --> 15:10.625
(Matt yelling)
LEE:<i> It was after</i>

15:10.627 --> 15:14.296
3:00 in the morning
when the noise outside woke me.

15:14.298 --> 15:16.865
MATT:
Hey! Hey! Hey, wake up!
(knocking)

15:16.867 --> 15:20.101
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
There's someone in our house!

15:20.103 --> 15:22.604
She shot her! She shot her!
She's dead.
What?

15:22.606 --> 15:23.839
I couldn't understand how anyone

15:23.841 --> 15:25.841
could have gotten
into the house.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.376
Not with a cop sitting
right outside the door.

15:28.378 --> 15:30.512
¶ ¶

15:30.514 --> 15:33.081
(floorboards creaking)

16:01.712 --> 16:03.311
Sir?

16:07.684 --> 16:10.552
I don't understand.

16:10.554 --> 16:11.920
They were just here.

16:11.922 --> 16:13.321
You must have
been dreaming.

16:13.323 --> 16:14.923
MATT:
<i> Started to think</i>

16:14.925 --> 16:17.192
that maybe I had suffered
some sort of neurological damage

16:17.194 --> 16:18.860
from the attack
back in Los Angeles.

16:18.862 --> 16:22.597
I... secretly hoped that I had.

16:22.599 --> 16:25.200
At least that would have
made sense.

16:25.202 --> 16:27.769
LEE:
<i> My brother and sister-in-law</i>

16:27.771 --> 16:30.939
<i> were fast getting</i>
<i> the reputation of being kooks.</i>

16:30.941 --> 16:33.241
<i> Kooks who liked to cry wolf.</i>

16:33.243 --> 16:35.010
<i> I knew the next time the cops</i>

16:35.012 --> 16:37.712
might not be
so quick to respond.

16:37.714 --> 16:40.515
So many weird things
were happening. It...

16:40.517 --> 16:44.953
It's amazing how long a person
can rationalize the irrational.

16:44.955 --> 16:46.154
(loud knocking)

16:47.124 --> 16:48.890
(sighs)

16:48.892 --> 16:51.359
Is she ready?

16:51.361 --> 16:54.296
Yeah. Her things are.

16:54.298 --> 16:56.631
Come.

16:57.801 --> 17:00.035
(door creaks)

17:00.037 --> 17:02.604
(sighs)

17:02.606 --> 17:08.143
Seems to be playing a surprise
game of hide-and-seek.

17:08.145 --> 17:09.978
Flora invented
her own special version

17:09.980 --> 17:12.814
of hide-and-seek
when she was three.

17:12.816 --> 17:15.250
Flora? It's time to go, baby.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.953
LEE:<i> She wouldn't tell us</i>
<i> that we were playing.</i>

17:17.955 --> 17:19.054
Where are you hiding?

17:19.056 --> 17:20.588
LEE:
<i> Part of the fun for her...</i>

17:20.590 --> 17:22.958
Sweetheart? Baby girl?
Got to go.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.327
LEE:<i> ...was seeing how long</i>
<i> it would take us to realize</i>

17:25.329 --> 17:27.062
<i> she was hiding.</i>

17:27.064 --> 17:28.964
<i> For a second,</i>
<i> it made me feel nostalgic.</i>

17:28.966 --> 17:30.665
Flora?
LEE:<i> Both of us, I think.</i>

17:35.639 --> 17:37.672
(sighs)

17:44.448 --> 17:46.514
(Flora whispering)

17:53.991 --> 17:56.057
(Flora talking quietly)

18:00.130 --> 18:01.129
Take her.

18:01.131 --> 18:02.764
I got you!
(laughs)

18:03.934 --> 18:05.100
Where'd she go?

18:05.102 --> 18:07.469
Where did who go?

18:07.471 --> 18:09.671
Priscilla.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.674
The little girl
with the funny clothes.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.843
I was offering her Mandy.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.111
Oh, your doll?

18:16.113 --> 18:17.946
Why would you do that?

18:17.948 --> 18:20.515
As a trade.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.283
So she wouldn't kill us.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.591
They're going to kill us all.

18:32.729 --> 18:35.096
And save me for last.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.138
Mason! Mason, please!

18:43.140 --> 18:44.873
Just let me kiss her good-bye!

18:44.875 --> 18:46.341
Come on!
Put your seatbelt on.

18:46.343 --> 18:47.876
LEE: It's okay.
No!

18:47.878 --> 18:49.077
She's not coming back here.

18:49.079 --> 18:50.512
How does an eight-year-old
even know

18:50.514 --> 18:52.480
how to say that? "Kill me last"?

18:52.482 --> 18:54.015
I don't know what's
going on in this house,

18:54.017 --> 18:55.350
but she's never
coming back here!
(Flora crying)

18:55.352 --> 18:56.851
It's okay.
Don't worry. It's o...

18:56.853 --> 18:58.319
It's okay. It's okay.
Calm down.

18:58.321 --> 19:00.822
Please! Please! Please!

19:00.824 --> 19:03.091
I'm calling the judge.
FLORA: I don't want to leave.
Daddy, please.

19:03.093 --> 19:05.160
Stop!

19:07.097 --> 19:09.631
LEE:<i> That's the day</i>
<i> I fell off the wagon.</i>

19:11.568 --> 19:14.102
(glass shatters)

19:14.104 --> 19:16.738
Someone's downstairs.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.606
(groans):
Oh.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.777
(sighs)

19:22.779 --> 19:25.080
(slurring):
I'm sorry, Shel...

19:25.082 --> 19:28.083
Shelby.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.051
I broke your bowl.

19:30.053 --> 19:31.920
Oh, shit.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.289
I didn't mean to.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.791
Lee, have you even been
to sleep yet?

19:38.028 --> 19:40.295
What the hell, Lee?!

19:43.366 --> 19:45.600
Shit.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.602
I didn't do that.
Okay.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.871
Uh-uh.
All right, come on, come on.

19:49.873 --> 19:52.107
MATT:<i> Neither one of us</i>
<i> believed her, but people do</i>

19:52.109 --> 19:54.542
<i> strange things when they are</i>
<i> under the influence.</i>

19:54.544 --> 19:56.544
<i> Hell, I've done plenty myself.</i>

19:56.546 --> 20:00.048
But it opened my eyes,
seeing her like that.

20:00.050 --> 20:01.916
MATT:<i> I mean, Lee was always</i>
<i> the strong one.</i>

20:01.918 --> 20:03.551
<i>She always took care of things.</i>

20:03.553 --> 20:06.287
I mean, my sister was the rock
of our family.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.423
You got to get
your shit together, girl.

20:08.425 --> 20:09.991
(groans)
Come on.

20:09.993 --> 20:12.594
You don't think
I know that?

20:12.596 --> 20:15.763
I'm trying,
but I'm weak.

20:15.765 --> 20:17.765
(sighs)

20:17.767 --> 20:20.835
You can't... you can't
let him find out.
Okay.

20:20.837 --> 20:23.404
Now, now, come on.
Or I'll never see
my daughter again.

20:23.406 --> 20:25.006
Calm down. Stop. Stop.

20:25.008 --> 20:27.008
Don't think about it.
No.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.077
We'll figure it out, okay?
(groans)

20:29.079 --> 20:31.513
Just let me take of you
for once, all right?

20:31.515 --> 20:34.015
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
SHELBY (in distance): Matt?

20:34.017 --> 20:36.351
Shh, shh.
SHELBY:
Could you come here, please?

20:36.353 --> 20:38.253
(whispers):
Just rest. Rest, girl. Rest.

20:38.255 --> 20:39.821
(groans)

20:39.823 --> 20:42.190
(sighs)

20:57.874 --> 21:00.508
Do you see her?

21:04.181 --> 21:06.381
I see her.

21:13.890 --> 21:16.691
Matt?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.259
There's something there.

21:27.671 --> 21:29.737
(creaking)

21:45.188 --> 21:47.121
(groans)

21:48.191 --> 21:50.525
(gasping)

21:50.527 --> 21:54.062
LEE:
<i>I was three sheets to the wind,</i>

21:54.064 --> 21:56.197
but I knew
Matt had left the room.

21:56.199 --> 21:57.865
<i> I felt...</i>

21:57.867 --> 22:00.368
<i> I sensed something--</i>

22:00.370 --> 22:04.005
someone-- watching over me.

22:06.776 --> 22:08.843
(quiet squishing)

22:21.691 --> 22:23.324
(gasps)

22:28.565 --> 22:31.032
(gasping)

22:31.034 --> 22:34.269
(panting)

22:38.375 --> 22:40.074
(sighs)

22:40.076 --> 22:41.743
(squealing)

22:41.745 --> 22:43.144
(screams)

22:44.281 --> 22:46.347
(panting)

22:58.962 --> 23:00.561
MATT:<i> We didn't know</i>
<i> who that little girl was.</i>

23:00.563 --> 23:01.562
<i> The way she was dressed,</i>
<i> we figured</i>

23:01.564 --> 23:02.597
she had to be a member

23:02.599 --> 23:04.232
of that hillbilly Polk family.

23:04.234 --> 23:07.068
<i> We were worried that maybe</i>
<i> they put her out there</i>

23:07.070 --> 23:09.337
<i> to lure us into a trap</i>
<i> or something.</i>

23:12.008 --> 23:15.977
<i> But we both felt, whatever</i>
<i> was going on in that cellar,</i>

23:15.979 --> 23:18.346
<i> we were going to find out.</i>

23:18.348 --> 23:20.348
<i> Together.</i>

23:22.952 --> 23:25.887
SHELBY:<i> It was like someone</i>
<i> had been living down there.</i>

23:28.024 --> 23:30.091
Who knows how long ago or...

23:30.093 --> 23:32.560
for how long?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.534
It made my skin crawl.

23:39.536 --> 23:42.370
<i> The girl didn't lead us there</i>
<i> as a trap.</i>

23:42.372 --> 23:44.872
<i> Mm-mm. She wanted us</i>
<i> to find that camera.</i>

23:44.874 --> 23:47.275
<i> What we didn't know was why.</i>

23:47.277 --> 23:49.944
<i> What was on that tape</i>
<i> that she wanted us to see?</i>

23:50.980 --> 23:53.648
I am not what I am.

23:53.650 --> 23:56.017
This...

23:56.019 --> 23:59.520
is not what I envisioned
when I first came here.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.323
But there are forces
that will not let me sleep.

24:02.325 --> 24:05.126
They keep coming to me,
showing me horrible things,

24:05.128 --> 24:06.794
escalating every night,

24:06.796 --> 24:09.063
until it got physical.
Look, look.

24:09.065 --> 24:11.065
Here's what they did to me.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.500
(panting)

24:12.502 --> 24:14.869
I'm too afraid
to go back into that house now.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.871
I fear that whatever
malevolent force is there

24:16.873 --> 24:18.840
intends to kill me.

24:18.842 --> 24:22.410
So... I'm living here
in the cellar.

24:22.412 --> 24:24.645
It's-it's cold. It's smelly.

24:24.647 --> 24:27.048
And-and despite appearances,
I am not crazy!

24:27.050 --> 24:29.884
I am an academic.
I am an author.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.320
Is this the same guy you saw
in the video in the woods?

24:32.322 --> 24:33.921
Yeah, that's him.

24:33.923 --> 24:37.692
What he said on that tape

24:37.694 --> 24:40.695
sounded insane.

24:40.697 --> 24:42.864
But...

24:42.866 --> 24:47.001
looking into his eyes
as he told the story...

24:47.003 --> 24:48.936
we were immediately pulled in.

24:48.938 --> 24:50.271
MAN:
<i> Okay, from the beginning.</i>

24:50.273 --> 24:54.575
Today is October 11, 1997.

24:54.577 --> 24:58.413
This recording will be
my last testament. Maybe.

24:58.415 --> 25:03.618
Um, I want to tell the truth,
as much as I know of it.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.754
Fact: my name is
Dr. Elias Cunningham.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.624
I am a professor
at Bradley University.

25:09.626 --> 25:11.626
Fact: I came here two months ago

25:11.628 --> 25:13.628
to begin research
on my new book, a, uh...

25:13.630 --> 25:16.063
a true crime novel
in the vein of<i> Helter Skelter.</i>

25:16.065 --> 25:19.066
Uh, my initial subjects
were two nurses,

25:19.068 --> 25:21.235
Miranda and Bridget Jane.

25:21.237 --> 25:23.037
They were sisters who spent
every waking moment together.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.373
They couldn't bear to be apart.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.608
They worked in an assisted
living facility in Rochester

25:27.610 --> 25:30.945
<i> in 1988.</i>

25:30.947 --> 25:32.914
<i> It was suspected but never</i>
<i> proven that they were behind</i>

25:32.916 --> 25:35.416
<i> the mysterious deaths</i>
<i> of two elderly patients.</i>

25:35.418 --> 25:37.919
<i> They quit their jobs before</i>
<i> any charges could be filed,</i>

25:37.921 --> 25:40.922
<i> and they wound up here,</i>
<i> in, uh... in North Carolina,</i>

25:40.924 --> 25:45.927
<i> where they opened a assisted</i>
<i> living facility of their own.</i>

25:45.929 --> 25:47.295
The house they purchased

25:47.297 --> 25:49.130
had previously been unoccupied
for 15 years.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.834
The family before-- a father,
a mother, two daughters--

25:52.836 --> 25:54.502
had lived in the house
only for a brief time

25:54.504 --> 25:55.970
before they suddenly vacated.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.505
They left
all their possessions behind.

25:57.507 --> 25:59.507
They left no forwarding address.

25:59.509 --> 26:02.410
But this ominous history
didn't deter my subjects.

26:02.412 --> 26:04.645
It may have even drawn them
to the house.

26:04.647 --> 26:08.749
Fact: the living facility
they opened was cheap,

26:08.751 --> 26:10.952
which ensured a bounty
of applicants, but they had

26:10.954 --> 26:13.087
their own unique criterion
for accepting applicants.

26:13.089 --> 26:15.256
<i> They wanted families</i>
<i> who were tired of</i>

26:15.258 --> 26:17.692
<i>taking care of their relatives,</i>
<i> families who just wanted</i>

26:17.694 --> 26:19.627
<i> a place to store them</i>
<i> until they died.</i>

26:19.629 --> 26:22.830
<i> But the most bizarre criteria</i>
<i> for accepting a patient</i>

26:22.832 --> 26:25.700
<i> had to do with the letter</i>
<i> of their first name.</i>

26:36.112 --> 26:37.912
(grunting)

26:41.384 --> 26:44.619
<i> They chose people</i>
<i> and murdered them</i>

26:44.621 --> 26:47.388
<i> because they were using</i>
<i> the letters of their names</i>

26:47.390 --> 26:50.892
<i> to spell out</i>
<i> their favorite word.</i>

26:52.829 --> 26:55.263
"R" is for Roger.

26:56.232 --> 26:58.533
(humming)

26:58.535 --> 27:00.768
(coughing)

27:03.172 --> 27:06.040
"E" is for Eunice. (chuckles)

27:06.543 --> 27:07.875
(laughing)

27:07.877 --> 27:09.710
BRIDGET:
<i> "M"</i>

27:09.712 --> 27:10.978
is for Margaret!

27:10.980 --> 27:12.179
(both laughing)

27:12.181 --> 27:14.682
I found Miranda's diary.

27:14.684 --> 27:16.050
What started
as a sick sisterly game

27:16.052 --> 27:17.885
soon became an act of defiance--

27:17.887 --> 27:21.155
against people, against society,
against life itself.

27:21.157 --> 27:23.524
Miranda became convinced
that each soul they took

27:23.526 --> 27:25.560
would add a lifetime
to their passion

27:25.562 --> 27:27.862
and ensure
that their love would...

27:27.864 --> 27:29.864
would eclipse eternity.

27:29.866 --> 27:32.066
<i> Fact: October 29, 1989,</i>

27:32.068 --> 27:34.168
<i> police were called</i>
<i> to investigate the facility.</i>

27:34.170 --> 27:35.770
<i> Apparently some relatives</i>

27:35.772 --> 27:37.171
<i> became concerned</i>
<i> when no one answered</i>

27:37.173 --> 27:39.040
<i> the telephone there</i>
<i> for three weeks.</i>

27:39.042 --> 27:42.944
<i> Bridget and Miranda were gone.</i>

27:42.946 --> 27:46.380
<i> They found not a single</i>
<i> personal item in the house.</i>

27:46.382 --> 27:49.584
<i> They alerted the FBI,</i>
<i> even the Mexican police,</i>

27:49.586 --> 27:52.987
<i>but the nurses had disappeared.</i>

27:56.259 --> 28:00.027
<i>The only thing they left behind</i>
<i> was a word, unfinished,</i>

28:00.029 --> 28:02.263
<i> on the wall.</i>

28:02.265 --> 28:04.832
"Murder."

28:08.204 --> 28:10.972
The house was put up for sale.

28:10.974 --> 28:12.073
They tried to make it
presentable.

28:12.075 --> 28:14.041
They put in new carpeting,
repainted all the walls.

28:14.043 --> 28:15.576
But each time

28:15.578 --> 28:17.445
<i> they covered the letters,</i>
<i> even if they looked away</i>

28:17.447 --> 28:21.515
<i> for a minute,</i>
<i> the word would reappear again.</i>

28:31.761 --> 28:32.827
What, Matt?

28:32.829 --> 28:35.162
(whispers):
"M" is for Margaret.
What?

28:35.164 --> 28:36.998
"M." "M."
"M" is for "Margaret."

28:37.000 --> 28:38.065
Matt.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.870
What are you doing?

28:45.008 --> 28:46.774
It's here.

28:46.776 --> 28:48.843
It's here.
She said it.

28:48.845 --> 28:50.344
I saw it.

28:50.346 --> 28:52.680
Matt, what are
you talking about?

29:05.695 --> 29:07.995
(panting)

29:08.931 --> 29:11.298
SHELBY:
<i> It seemed...</i>

29:11.300 --> 29:13.968
<i> totally crazy.</i>

29:13.970 --> 29:17.038
<i> But everything he said</i>
<i> on that tape was true.</i>

29:17.040 --> 29:19.874
The letters on the wall
proved it.

29:19.876 --> 29:21.942
And he wasn't finished.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.713
There is an official story,

29:25.715 --> 29:27.782
and that story is about
two homicidal nurses

29:27.784 --> 29:30.851
who killed five elderly patients
and fled the country.

29:30.853 --> 29:31.852
They got away with murder,

29:31.854 --> 29:33.287
but I know the truth now
and I am convinced

29:33.289 --> 29:34.789
that is not what happened.

29:34.791 --> 29:37.058
They didn't leave,
they were stopped.

29:37.060 --> 29:39.493
Something got to them

29:39.495 --> 29:41.996
before they were able to take
their final victim

29:41.998 --> 29:43.698
and finish spelling "murder."

29:43.700 --> 29:45.900
Not by the police, by something

29:45.902 --> 29:47.868
even more evil than they were.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.170
Something here.

29:49.172 --> 29:50.538
Everywhere.

29:50.540 --> 29:51.839
In the air.

29:51.841 --> 29:54.141
In the woods.

29:54.143 --> 29:56.510
(voice quivering):
In that house.

29:56.512 --> 30:02.483
I haven't set foot
in that house... in days.

30:02.485 --> 30:05.886
But I'm going back in there.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.855
I don't know if I will survive,

30:07.857 --> 30:11.492
but I have to see
exactly what it is.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.133
(panting)

30:27.777 --> 30:29.777
I know you're in here.

30:32.048 --> 30:33.347
Show yourself.

30:39.856 --> 30:41.822
(gasps)
Okay. All right, okay.

30:45.862 --> 30:48.429
(sobbing)

30:48.431 --> 30:50.931
Show yourself!

30:50.933 --> 30:52.933
(metal scraping on glass)

31:02.779 --> 31:05.045
Oh, my... Turn it off.

31:05.047 --> 31:06.413
Wait, wait, wait.

31:06.415 --> 31:08.482
(panting)

31:13.422 --> 31:14.989
(screams, whimpers)

31:14.991 --> 31:17.558
(distant thump)
What was that?

31:39.315 --> 31:42.850
We wanted out.
We wanted our money back.

31:42.852 --> 31:44.752
We wanted our lives back.

31:44.754 --> 31:46.253
The bank sold it to us,

31:46.255 --> 31:49.089
and the bank was just gonna
have to take it back.

31:49.091 --> 31:50.157
I just called their rep and said

31:50.159 --> 31:52.426
we needed to discuss
our options.

31:52.428 --> 31:53.661
No choice?

31:53.663 --> 31:55.029
Well, of course
we have a choice.

31:55.031 --> 31:56.330
We could sue you for fraud.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.032
Some nurses ran
a facility here

31:58.034 --> 32:00.835
and they killed their patients,
under this roof.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.837
Why are we finding
all this out now?

32:02.839 --> 32:04.171
Let me explain
this once more.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.940
When you bid
on this house,

32:05.942 --> 32:08.375
you committed to buy
the property as is.

32:08.377 --> 32:10.010
Any due diligence
needed to be

32:10.012 --> 32:11.812
complete by the time
you raised your hand.

32:11.814 --> 32:13.848
It wouldn't have made
a difference though, would it?

32:13.850 --> 32:16.317
We found out about the nurses,
Googled their story,

32:16.319 --> 32:18.853
but it doesn't correspond
with our house.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.488
Why? Because you changed
the street address.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.290
What else are you
trying to hide?

32:23.292 --> 32:25.125
You entered a contract
with this bank, ma'am.

32:25.127 --> 32:26.827
I'm not a realtor.

32:26.829 --> 32:29.396
I've met my
obligations here.

32:29.398 --> 32:31.232
(briefcase clicks)

32:31.234 --> 32:33.300
If you decide to sell,
we can offer your buyer

32:33.302 --> 32:34.902
very competitive rates.

32:34.904 --> 32:36.537
(sighs)

32:36.539 --> 32:38.372
SHELBY:
<i> We were railroaded.</i>

32:38.374 --> 32:41.408
There was no going backwards.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.577
We were trapped.

32:43.579 --> 32:47.848
We'll never get back
what we paid for this.

32:47.850 --> 32:49.850
Those swamp people
would buy it tomorrow

32:49.852 --> 32:51.585
if we gave 'em a holler.

32:51.587 --> 32:53.187
(scoffs) No way.

32:53.189 --> 32:55.923
Oh, I feel sick to my stomach.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.861
I didn't think
it could get any worse.

33:00.863 --> 33:03.197
<i> Then it did.</i>

33:03.199 --> 33:05.666
Is that Lee?

33:09.939 --> 33:11.739
LEE:
All right, here we are.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.707
MATT:
<i> When I saw Lee with Flora...</i>

33:13.709 --> 33:15.576
(car door opens)

33:15.578 --> 33:17.111
(Lee sighs)

33:18.714 --> 33:20.080
All right, come on, baby.

33:20.082 --> 33:23.017
I was looking at my sister
committing a felony.

33:23.019 --> 33:25.019
I just wanted to see her.

33:35.965 --> 33:38.365
(sighs)

33:38.367 --> 33:40.367
But then there she was.

33:40.369 --> 33:41.936
(laughter)
<i> Next thing I knew,</i>

33:41.938 --> 33:43.938
<i> we were driving back</i>
<i> to the house.</i>

33:43.940 --> 33:45.406
I'll get you something to drink.

33:45.408 --> 33:47.341
Okay.

33:50.579 --> 33:52.613
Lee...
Oh...

33:52.615 --> 33:55.549
There's nothing that
we need to talk about.

33:55.551 --> 33:58.319
(Matt sighs)

33:58.321 --> 33:59.720
Does Mason know?

33:59.722 --> 34:02.256
Mason does not
control my life.

34:02.258 --> 34:04.959
Hey, Flora, why don't
we do your homework

34:04.961 --> 34:07.161
in the other room and you
can have a snack in a minute.

34:07.163 --> 34:10.130
Okay.
Okay.

34:10.132 --> 34:13.000
Come on.

34:13.002 --> 34:14.501
Hey.

34:18.841 --> 34:20.741
(softly):
Okay.

34:24.347 --> 34:25.980
Are you drunk?

34:27.817 --> 34:29.850
I would never endanger my child

34:29.852 --> 34:33.020
by driving with
a drop of alcohol in my system.

34:33.022 --> 34:36.623
Then you must have
lost your mind.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.993
He's going to the judge.

34:38.995 --> 34:41.462
He's gonna make sure
I never see her again.

34:41.464 --> 34:43.664
Not after this stunt.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.199
Lee...

34:45.201 --> 34:47.001
Lee, you're a
police officer.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.670
And technically
this is kidnapping.

34:49.672 --> 34:53.173
He's gonna go to the cops,
if he hasn't already.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.976
This is bad, Lee.
This is really bad.

34:55.978 --> 34:58.512
There could be an AMBER Alert
out on you right now.

35:01.550 --> 35:03.317
She's my daughter!

35:03.319 --> 35:05.486
I have a right to see her!

35:05.488 --> 35:07.021
You have a custody agreement.

35:07.023 --> 35:09.223
Which he is trying to break.

35:09.225 --> 35:11.959
SHELBY:
Yes, yes, Mason, she's here.

35:11.961 --> 35:14.561
She's safe.

35:14.563 --> 35:17.498
No, Flora's doing
her homework right now.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.333
Yes, I know
that you are angry.

35:19.335 --> 35:21.969
You have every right
to be furious.

35:21.971 --> 35:22.970
(whispers):
Lee...

35:22.972 --> 35:25.039
No, no, no,
no, no, Mason.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.007
Please don't involve them.

35:27.009 --> 35:29.043
You don't want Flora
to have to see

35:29.045 --> 35:31.645
her mother dealing
with the police.

35:31.647 --> 35:33.080
It wasn't malicious.

35:33.082 --> 35:36.050
She just wanted to
see her daughter.

35:36.052 --> 35:37.918
Yes, of course, yes.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.420
We'll be here.

35:39.422 --> 35:41.055
Okay.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.589
Bye.

35:44.527 --> 35:46.160
It's gonna be okay.

35:46.162 --> 35:48.662
He's really pissed,

35:48.664 --> 35:51.698
but I think I talked him
off the ledge.

35:51.700 --> 35:55.169
Well, thank you for that.

35:55.171 --> 35:57.805
I'm so sorry.

36:06.882 --> 36:08.015
Hey.

36:09.385 --> 36:11.185
I understand.

36:12.922 --> 36:14.788
Really I do.

36:14.790 --> 36:17.091
LEE:
<i> I know what I did was insane.</i>

36:17.093 --> 36:19.793
<i> Did I really want to be on</i>
<i>the run with an eight-year-old?</i>

36:19.795 --> 36:22.930
To turn her life upside down,
even more than it was?

36:22.932 --> 36:25.632
To hide her away
from her father forever?

36:27.636 --> 36:29.603
<i> Flora deserved better.</i>

36:29.605 --> 36:32.005
(girl giggling in distance)

36:47.089 --> 36:48.789
Let me say good-bye to Flora.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.991
Before he comes for her.

36:50.993 --> 36:54.094
It's the right thing, Lee.

36:54.096 --> 36:56.797
She's in the living room.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.741
(door creaking)

37:07.743 --> 37:11.078
LEE:<i> We looked everywhere</i>
<i> in that house.</i>

37:11.080 --> 37:13.013
My baby was gone.

37:13.015 --> 37:14.414
Where are you?!

37:14.416 --> 37:15.816
Flora!

37:19.088 --> 37:20.754
Flora!

37:22.691 --> 37:24.758
Flora?

37:25.928 --> 37:27.261
Flora?

37:27.263 --> 37:29.530
(twigs snapping,
leaves rustling)

37:33.302 --> 37:34.868
(Lee screams, Shelby gasps)

37:34.870 --> 37:35.969
Did you hear that?

37:35.971 --> 37:39.373
(Lee screaming)

37:39.375 --> 37:41.008
(whimpering)

37:41.010 --> 37:42.910
Oh, my...
