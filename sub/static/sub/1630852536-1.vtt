WEBVTT

00:18.453 --> 00:20.672
- They can't start construction
at 7 A.M.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.891
You have a book to write.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.327
- I know, but what can I do?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.373
Neighbors on both sides
are redoing their kitchens!

00:25.416 --> 00:27.418
It's impossible to concentrate.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.203
On the upside,
I did write a poem

00:29.246 --> 00:31.248
called Ode to a Jackhammer.

00:34.512 --> 00:37.124
Oh hey, they're, uh...
They're taking down my display.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.213
- Oh no. At least your book
was in the window

00:39.256 --> 00:41.432
for what, almost ten months?

00:41.476 --> 00:43.478
- Ten months, two weeks,
and four days!

00:43.521 --> 00:45.132
But... who's counting?

00:45.175 --> 00:46.655
- Well, I love that book

00:46.698 --> 00:48.309
and I can't wait
for the next one.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.400
I better head to work.
I don't want to keep
my boss waiting.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.705
- Yeah, my publisher
wants me to call.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.098
But can we meet
for coffee later?

00:55.142 --> 00:56.491
I'll be there trying to write.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.275
I want to hear all about
your new job!

00:58.319 --> 00:59.624
- You bet.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.326
- They're not gonna just
toss me away.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.461
Hey, Allen. How are you?

01:10.505 --> 01:13.073
- Better once I hear
good new about book two.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.162
How's it going?

01:15.945 --> 01:18.208
- That is such
an interesting question.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.557
- Here we go...

01:19.601 --> 01:21.820
- Because I've been outlining,

01:21.864 --> 01:23.605
and working out
some story points.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.869
- Emily, your first book
did great business.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.045
But you can't rest
on your laurels.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.917
- Believe me, I'm not resting
on anything.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.573
I-It's just, uh...

01:35.617 --> 01:37.880
a little trickier
with this new book.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.447
- You're a great writer, Emily,

01:39.490 --> 01:41.101
when you actually write.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.494
But word from upstairs
is that if we don't see

01:43.538 --> 01:45.192
the first three chapters
at least

01:45.235 --> 01:46.410
by the end of the month...

01:46.454 --> 01:47.933
- Then they'll cancel your book.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.066
- And I'll be in breach
of contract.

01:50.632 --> 01:53.330
I mean, yes, I was supposed
to finish a few months ago,

01:53.374 --> 01:55.158
so they've already spent
the ad budget promoting

01:55.202 --> 01:57.117
a book that doesn't exist,
and now

01:57.160 --> 01:59.075
they want to cut their losses.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.469
- Have you finished
any chapters?

02:01.512 --> 02:03.123
- You know, it's...

02:03.166 --> 02:04.907
It is tricky trying to write
a romance

02:04.950 --> 02:06.430
fresh from a breakup, so...

02:06.474 --> 02:09.129
- Fresh? It's been
almost a year.

02:11.174 --> 02:14.699
- I mean, it's...
It's just hard to write,

02:14.743 --> 02:16.353
and I don't know why.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.443
It doesn't help that half
the places in Boulder

02:19.487 --> 02:20.792
remind me of Michael.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.275
Ugh, enough of my complaining.
Okay...

02:25.319 --> 02:26.755
How's your new job?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.409
- Only been there a week,

02:28.452 --> 02:30.193
but I never knew
that property management

02:30.237 --> 02:31.325
could be so complicated.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.502
- You are gonna do great,
I know it.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.851
- Wait...

02:35.894 --> 02:38.245
I have an idea
that could help the both of us!

02:38.288 --> 02:41.465
- Uh, I might be beyond help,
but shoot.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.467
- My boss got a call
this morning.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.861
One of the caretakers
at the property they manage

02:45.904 --> 02:47.863
had to leave 'cause his dad
slipped and fell.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.778
- Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.

02:49.821 --> 02:53.477
But they need a winter caretaker
to fill in ASAP.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.087
- Uh, a caretaker,
what do you mean?

02:55.131 --> 02:56.785
- It's this empty chalet
up in the mountains.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.830
It belongs to some wealthy
family in Europe

02:58.874 --> 03:00.528
but they haven't been there
in years.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.138
- What does this have
to do with me?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.836
- You need somewhere quiet
to write, some solitude

03:04.880 --> 03:06.186
so you can focus.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.536
And didn't you say
it's hard to think romance

03:08.579 --> 03:10.581
in Boulder right now?
- Well, yes.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.757
- And I'd look pretty good
first week on the job

03:12.801 --> 03:14.368
if I helped out in a pinch!

03:14.411 --> 03:16.196
My boss is desperate.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.502
- Look, a winter chalet
sounds magical,

03:18.546 --> 03:20.765
but I've never been
a caretaker before.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.114
What would I need to do?

03:22.158 --> 03:24.682
- Just knock some icicles
off the roof,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.510
and run the water
so the pipes don't freeze.

03:26.554 --> 03:27.729
That's it.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.513
With the owners never there,

03:29.557 --> 03:32.473
the place runs itself.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.388
- Wow.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.606
It's gorgeous.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.914
A change of scenery
couldn't hurt.

03:39.610 --> 03:42.091
Okay, let's say
I was interested. What's next?

03:42.134 --> 03:44.093
- Meet my boss
and look over the contract.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.268
That's it.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.488
- Hmm.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.230
A winter writing retreat.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.145
Okay! Where do I sign?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.650
"Emily, the key opens the door,

04:19.694 --> 04:22.262
the pen is so you do
some great writing,

04:22.305 --> 04:23.872
good luck. Becca."

04:43.587 --> 04:45.328
I could get used to this.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.331
- So, what do you think
of the place?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.724
- It's gorgeous!

04:49.767 --> 04:51.856
It's so inviting and warm,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.902
and some interesting decor.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.818
Becca, this place is perfect.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.342
- Well, my boss couldn't be
happier with me,

04:59.386 --> 05:02.432
so if you get some writing done,
it's a classic win-win.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.868
Is it romantic?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.566
You are writing a romance,
after all.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.438
- Yep! All by my lonesome.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.676
Yes!

05:28.719 --> 05:29.981
No...

06:13.198 --> 06:15.549
A fresh start in the morning
couldn't hurt.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.031
First day, and I'm already
talking to myself.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.434
Who goes there?!

07:14.477 --> 07:16.958
- Uh, what? Hello?

07:17.001 --> 07:18.263
Hi.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.222
- Uh, if it's a package,

07:20.265 --> 07:21.919
just leave it at the door.
Thank you.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.879
- No, I'm not a delivery man.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.924
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to open the door.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.449
- Uh, sorry,
that's not gonna happen.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.928
- Why not, may I ask?

07:31.973 --> 07:34.105
- Clayton, it's okay!
Go back to sleep!

07:34.149 --> 07:35.803
My four brothers are sleeping

07:35.846 --> 07:38.414
and army rangers on leave
get so tired.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.285
- Look, I can prove
that I've been here before.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.766
There should be a desk by
the window with a quill pen,

07:42.810 --> 07:45.465
and a coat of arms
above the fire place.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.337
- Yes, but I would need to
contact the property company--

07:48.380 --> 07:50.078
- I even have a key,

07:50.121 --> 07:52.210
I just can't seem
to work it in the lock.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.603
- Where did you get that key?

07:53.647 --> 07:55.736
- My family owns this chalet,

07:55.779 --> 07:57.302
I'm... I'm Henry.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.391
- The family who owns
the chalet lives somewhere...

07:59.435 --> 08:00.784
- In Europe! Yes.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.439
Concordia, to be exact.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.400
- Uh...

08:09.489 --> 08:10.968
Uh, sorry about that.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
- Oh no, it's quite alright.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.885
It's just a bit freezing
out there.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.542
- So, a-are you staying?
- Who are you?

08:19.586 --> 08:20.891
- Emily.
- What are you doing here?

08:20.935 --> 08:22.153
- My job.
- What's your job?

08:22.197 --> 08:23.372
- Making sure pipes don't burst.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.592
- Ah...
- And keeping burglars away.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.245
- Do I look like a burglar?
- Maybe.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.508
A well-dressed one.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.031
Look, I'm gonna make a call.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.990
- Really, I am very tired
and there is so much to do.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.862
So perhaps you can
start us some tea?

08:36.037 --> 08:36.994
- Uh...

08:37.865 --> 08:39.867
Oh, there's more people.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.044
- Really, Henry, there's no
excuse for driving like that!

08:43.087 --> 08:44.785
- Sorry, Tilson,
those mountain curves

08:44.828 --> 08:46.264
were way too tempting,
and anyway,

08:46.308 --> 08:48.136
you should've kept up.
- Well, if you insist

08:48.179 --> 08:50.007
on driving yourself,
at least let Fritz

08:50.051 --> 08:51.095
drive with you.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.097
What's this?
- I don't know.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.882
Some sort of Emily person.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.318
- What's going on here?

08:56.361 --> 08:57.667
- Apparently, I'm a burglar.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.583
- Actually, I said "maybe,"
if you recall.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.368
- Well, your diligence
is commendable but misplaced.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.196
I've been in touch
with your employer,

09:05.240 --> 09:06.763
the property management company.

09:06.807 --> 09:09.070
You are Ms. Miller, I presume.
- Yes.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.332
- We flew in from Concordia
this morning.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.594
I would've telephoned,

09:11.638 --> 09:13.770
but apparently,
your phone is turned off?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
- I did forget to charge it
last night.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.165
- Tilson, send a call
to my father.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.428
Fritz, old chap, have a look
at that alleged

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
sports utility vehicle.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.431
The suspension feels
a bit dodgy.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.650
- Sir.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.695
- Oh, I'm sorry.
We wouldn't want to wake

09:25.739 --> 09:28.002
Clayton and the rest
of the army rangers, would we?

09:28.045 --> 09:29.917
- I made that up.
- Did you?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.223
- Just as a precaution.
- You're so clever.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.573
- Your Highness,
we're behind schedule.

09:33.616 --> 09:34.878
- Of course. Emily...

09:34.922 --> 09:37.664
That tea when you get
a second, please.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.405
- Um...

09:40.449 --> 09:41.668
Wait, "Your Highness"?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.365
- Yes, that is the proper
form of address

09:43.408 --> 09:45.280
for the crowned prince
of Concordia.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.935
- Yeah, right!

09:47.978 --> 09:49.110
A prince!

09:49.153 --> 09:51.808
- You may do a web search
if you must.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.549
- If I had a signal, I would.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.899
- We brought our own hotspot.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.859
Password is OffWithTheirHeads!
All one word.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.991
Prince Henry does enjoy
the odd joke.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.385
- Could've fooled me.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.693
A prince?

10:18.356 --> 10:19.793
- Sorry...

10:24.885 --> 10:27.235
- Uh...

10:27.278 --> 10:29.193
Your Highness, I'm...

10:29.237 --> 10:31.326
Do I curtsey, or bow, or--
- Oh, no.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.893
A simple "good morning" will do.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.764
- Good morning.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.637
You know, I...

10:37.680 --> 10:39.421
I should probably change.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.379
- You might need your socks.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.470
- Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!

10:45.514 --> 10:48.386
I found a hole in my boots
last night, and I was just...

10:48.430 --> 10:49.518
I was just drying them off.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.999
- On the Concordian
coat of arms?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.827
- Oh, is that what that is?

10:53.870 --> 10:54.958
It's nice.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.265
- What is your role around here?

10:57.918 --> 10:59.397
- I'm the caretaker.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.138
- The caretaker, really?

11:01.182 --> 11:02.357
- Is that so hard to believe?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.968
- I just don't see
much care being taken.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.318
- Ha, right.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.673
- Interesting slippers.

11:17.067 --> 11:20.070
- I'm just gonna go
change my clothes and take
these slippers off.

11:22.377 --> 11:26.120
- So, flight was smooth
as can be.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.253
No, Father, I'll be home
in a week,

11:29.297 --> 11:32.039
after my task is complete,
I told you.

11:34.128 --> 11:37.218
Look, can't Edwina handle
the cabinet meeting

11:37.261 --> 11:38.436
just this once? I mean,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.612
that's what royal siblings
are for.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.094
Right. Tilson,
my schedule, please.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.444
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Um...

11:46.488 --> 11:49.447
Yes, perhaps I can
try to fit it in!

11:52.929 --> 11:55.279
- So he's really a prince, huh?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.064
- For a short time, anyway.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.630
Next week, he'll be king.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.025
Now, introductions. Fritz...

12:02.069 --> 12:05.246
- I'm Fritz, his Highness'
body guard and personal valet.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.291
- Ah, nice to meet you, Fritz.

12:07.335 --> 12:10.294
- And I'm Ms. Tilson,
the prince's chief of staff.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.297
It's my job to make sure
that the prince's royal duties

12:13.341 --> 12:15.952
are met with utmost precision.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.476
- Gotcha. That's great. Uh...

12:18.520 --> 12:20.696
Look, you guys seem
really busy, um...

12:20.740 --> 12:23.438
I just came down to let you know
I'm gonna gather my stuff,

12:23.481 --> 12:26.963
pack it up, and leave you
to your royal business.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.749
- And why would you do that?

12:30.445 --> 12:32.577
- Well, I mean,
you're all here now.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.231
I assume you don't want
me in your way.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.234
- Want and need
are two separate things.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.715
You are the caretaker,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.195
are you not?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.241
- Uh, yeah, sure.
I mean, for like 24 hours now.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.940
- Well, due to short notice,
only Fritz and myself

12:46.983 --> 12:48.811
are here to see
to the prince's needs.

12:48.855 --> 12:53.250
Your services are still required
for the week that we are here.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.818
- Um, my job was to knock
icicles loose

12:55.862 --> 12:57.385
and keeps the pipes
from freezing out.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.127
- And you shall, while doing
other tasks as well.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.433
It usually takes at least
a dozen staff

13:02.477 --> 13:04.784
to meet the basic needs
of the prince.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.437
- Look...

13:06.481 --> 13:08.004
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.746
- No, I think it is you
who fails to understand.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.923
May I remind you of the contract
that you signed?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.620
If you have any issues,

13:15.664 --> 13:18.449
may I suggest you take it up
with the management company.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.974
- Um... No, no, no.
See, I-I-I...

13:21.017 --> 13:22.976
I came here for peace and quiet.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.716
Okay, I'm a writer, and--

13:24.760 --> 13:26.327
- And that will be all.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.372
Staff, back to work.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.857
- And I was standing there
in my pink bathrobe

13:34.901 --> 13:37.773
and bunny slippers!
It was humiliating!

13:37.817 --> 13:39.340
- They swooped in unexpectedly.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.647
I had no idea. My boss said
they haven't visited in years.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.171
- Becca, it's not your fault.

13:44.214 --> 13:47.957
But... they can't be right
about that contract I signed.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.873
- I'm so sorry, but I just
read the fine print.

13:50.917 --> 13:54.703
"The caretaker shall assist
with all reasonable requests

13:54.746 --> 13:57.227
made by the property owner
or their representative."

13:57.271 --> 14:00.100
- Huh. As a writer, you'd think
I'd pay more attention

14:00.143 --> 14:01.623
to the words.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.494
Guess I should've read
the whole contract.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.018
- Em, this is all my fault.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.021
Just come home, I'll deal
with this as best I can.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.805
- Thank you.
- You're up there to write,

14:09.849 --> 14:11.938
not to get wrapped up
in my drama.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.461
- Drama?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.810
Oh, wait a minute.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.638
Becca, if I quit
and break my contract,

14:16.681 --> 14:18.379
then you're in bad
with your new boss.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.163
- It'll be fine,
I'll figure something out.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.470
- No, no, no, no. Becca, I...

14:22.513 --> 14:23.906
You know what? I got this.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.866
I will write in the evenings
and in other spare time.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.780
- But the deadline
for your book.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.608
Emily, are you sure about this?

14:30.652 --> 14:31.522
- Positive!

14:31.566 --> 14:32.872
Besides, as a writer,

14:32.915 --> 14:35.178
I need to open myself up
to new experiences

14:35.222 --> 14:37.528
and interesting characters.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.009
You never know. Maybe this
will give me some new material

14:40.053 --> 14:41.054
for my book.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.012
- Okay, if you're sure.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.890
In fact, I think
I already have some.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.546
- Ms. Miller, please.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.940
- Yes, Ms. Tilson,
I'm clearing out my things,

14:57.984 --> 14:59.463
like you asked.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.379
- And all the other rooms
you tried writing in, please.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.295
- Well, what is all this for?

15:05.339 --> 15:07.341
- The prince has wall-to-wall
interviews

15:07.384 --> 15:09.299
and video calls scheduled.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.868
Oh. What's this?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.958
- Oh, my idea book.
Can't forget that.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.308
- Oh, Tilson!

15:18.352 --> 15:21.094
I need your thoughts
on the last line of my speech.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.617
Now, the new ending
sounds like this.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.011
So, "Ladies and gentlemen
and gathered dignitaries,

15:25.054 --> 15:26.882
this treaty will benefit
both of our nations,

15:26.926 --> 15:29.711
with 20 percent more
high-tech trade,

15:29.754 --> 15:31.800
and 18 percent...

15:31.843 --> 15:33.933
expanded agricultural exports."

15:35.760 --> 15:36.805
How's that sound?

15:36.848 --> 15:38.546
- A little stuffy, actually.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.330
- I beg your pardon?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.854
- Oh. Sorry, Your Highness.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.988
I just meant it sounded
a little formal.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.685
- Yes, of course
it sounds formal.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.992
This address was crafted
by several members

15:50.036 --> 15:51.646
of the Concordian
foreign service

15:51.689 --> 15:54.344
to thaw trade with one of our
formerly quarrelsome neighbors,

15:54.388 --> 15:56.390
the nation of Ancadia.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.566
Did you have
a better suggestion, or...?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.786
- Then it's a happy
occasion, right?

16:02.744 --> 16:03.875
- Sure.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.008
- Yeah, how about
something like, um...

16:06.052 --> 16:09.055
"So, formal rivals
and now future friends,

16:09.098 --> 16:12.014
this happy day is long overdue.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.191
A chance to turn
swords into silicon chips,

16:15.235 --> 16:17.628
and arguments into apples."
Something like that.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.630
And then, "To benefit
both our great nations

16:19.674 --> 16:21.067
moving forward."

16:21.763 --> 16:24.244
- Hmm. I like the ring of that.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.636
- Yeah?

16:27.856 --> 16:29.945
- That might work.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.120
- You're welcome.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.862
- Oh, sorry.
Where are my manners?

16:33.905 --> 16:35.864
Thank you.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.954
- Oh, that's my pen.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.087
- Ms. Miller...

16:41.130 --> 16:42.653
A word?

16:42.697 --> 16:44.003
- Yes.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.530
Wow! All this stuff!

16:49.573 --> 16:51.227
Y-You guys planning an invasion?

16:51.271 --> 16:52.837
- The prince insists

16:52.881 --> 16:54.404
on a regimented daily schedule,

16:54.448 --> 16:57.190
so as not to waste
even a minute of his time.

16:57.233 --> 17:00.236
- Man. If I were that organized,
I'd crank out a book a week.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.455
- Yes, about that...

17:01.498 --> 17:03.674
While you may be a writer,

17:03.718 --> 17:05.937
you're also a member
of the royal household

17:05.981 --> 17:06.764
this week.

17:06.808 --> 17:07.939
- Of course, Ms. Tilson,

17:07.983 --> 17:09.506
but I do plan on writing
in my spare time.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.031
- How you spend your free time
is none of my concern.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.815
But as a member of the staff,

17:13.858 --> 17:16.165
I need to make you aware
of what is expected.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.732
- Right.
- Firstly...

17:17.775 --> 17:22.215
You do not offer your opinion
willy-nilly to the prince!

17:22.258 --> 17:24.956
He is very busy.
- But don't you think it helped?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.742
- That's irrelevant.
You speak when spoken to.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.265
And that is all.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.484
- Got it, okay.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.834
What else?
- As to your duties,

17:32.877 --> 17:34.923
you will start your day
by procuring

17:34.966 --> 17:36.925
the prince's morning newspaper.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.970
- Uh, can't he just
read the news online?

17:39.014 --> 17:42.148
- The prince enjoys an actual
newspaper with his breakfast,

17:42.191 --> 17:44.237
which commences at 7:05
every morning.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.108
- Okay. Newspaper, check.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.979
- The prince reads
the London Concord

17:48.023 --> 17:49.764
to stay up on world affairs.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.374
- Uh...

17:51.418 --> 17:53.333
The closest this town
has to a news stand

17:53.376 --> 17:55.552
is some magazines
at the gas station mini mart.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.859
- You'll figure it out.
Now, moving on,

17:57.902 --> 17:59.861
the prince prefers
his eggs soft-boiled.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.429
- Oh, Ms. Tilson.
I have to stop you right there.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.039
I am not much of a cook.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.998
- The prince's personal chef
learned his wife was in labor

18:07.042 --> 18:10.480
as we left for the airport,
so as the chef is not available,

18:10.524 --> 18:13.266
you will step in.
Now, there should always be

18:13.309 --> 18:15.572
a crackling fire going
and tea at the ready.

18:15.616 --> 18:19.620
Tea should be served between
76 and 85 degrees Celsius

18:19.663 --> 18:22.362
unless the prince requests
oolong, which should be served

18:22.405 --> 18:24.842
between 82 and 87 degrees.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.975
Any questions?
- Just one.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.151
Can you take that again
from the top?

18:38.378 --> 18:39.857
- Fritz, we're frozen again.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.729
- Uh, we're back, sir.
- Right.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.253
Okay, so, yes...
As I was saying,

18:44.297 --> 18:46.951
addressing the manufacturer's
association by web cam

18:46.995 --> 18:49.302
is more than sufficient,
I assure you.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.521
- It's just not how
things are done, Henry.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.481
- Shirking your royal duties,
big brother?

18:54.524 --> 18:56.396
- Quite the opposite.
I am on the phone

18:56.439 --> 18:58.615
with both of you right now,
and if I were back home,

18:58.659 --> 19:00.400
look, I wouldn't be able
to attend

19:00.443 --> 19:01.488
to important matters here.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.229
- Don't worry, Henry.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.926
I'll cover for you
while you're gone.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.189
Anyway, I played
the queen before,

19:07.233 --> 19:09.713
when I was six and wore
Mother's tiara.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.586
- Yes. You do wear so many hats.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.154
Thank you, Edwina,
you're a life saver.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.201
- You know, your uncle's
old home is hardly a matter

19:19.245 --> 19:20.550
that requires your attention

19:20.594 --> 19:22.509
a week before your coronation.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.337
- This place means
a great deal to me.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.295
Anyways, you know the law,
Father.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.603
A king cannot own or inherit
land outside of the kingdom,

19:29.646 --> 19:30.865
so this place must be sold

19:30.908 --> 19:33.128
next week
before I take the crown.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
Now, please, let's not quibble
about this any more.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.046
- At least we agree on that.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.091
Knock, knock!
- Come in.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.529
- 7:05 A.M.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.053
- What is that?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.360
- It's my breakfast, I think?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.449
- Sorry, Your Highness,
the toaster is tricky,

19:49.492 --> 19:52.321
and I had a little trouble
making soft-boiled eggs,

19:52.365 --> 19:53.496
so I scrambled them.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.063
- But how did they get so grey?

19:55.106 --> 19:56.847
- You know, honestly,
I'm not sure.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.545
But the tea is the right color.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.199
- Thank goodness.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.897
- Henry... Who might this be?

20:02.940 --> 20:04.377
- Yes, um...

20:04.420 --> 20:06.727
Emily, this is my f...

20:06.770 --> 20:08.207
Father, this is Emily.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.817
She's the caretaker
at the chalet.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.514
Emily, this is my father,
King William.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.863
- Nice to meet you,
Your Majesty.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.301
I'd curtsey, but I might
spill the tray.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.260
- Not to worry.
Your hands are full.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.349
Especially with my stubborn son.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.961
- Is that my morning newspaper?

20:24.005 --> 20:26.442
- Yes! The London Concord.

20:26.486 --> 20:29.402
I... I had to print it
in sections

20:29.445 --> 20:31.404
and tape it together.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.536
Will there be anything else?

20:35.582 --> 20:37.453
- No, I think you've done
quite enough.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.281
- Okie-dokie. Alright.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.152
Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.982
That was my pen.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.288
- Now, Father,

20:46.332 --> 20:48.203
as far as the meeting
of the Lords on Friday,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.726
I was thinking
that would be a good time

20:49.770 --> 20:51.250
to discuss the treaty.

20:51.293 --> 20:54.601
- About that, I spoke
with the ambassador last night,

20:54.644 --> 20:56.603
and I have some very
crucial information.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.866
Apparently--

20:58.909 --> 21:02.304
- Yes? About that, what?
Fritz, we lost him again!

21:02.348 --> 21:04.045
- Got it!

21:04.088 --> 21:06.221
- Someone seems to have knocked
the power cord loose, sir.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.180
- Well, who the devil did that?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.400
- Oops.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.359
- Oops?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.752
We were just discussing
important matters of the state.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.711
- Give me two minutes, you'll be
back online with him, sir.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.843
- Okay.
- Sorry, Your Highness.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.889
- It's...

21:21.932 --> 21:23.412
- I just...

21:23.456 --> 21:25.022
I just don't get why...

21:25.066 --> 21:26.285
you'd fly all the way here

21:26.328 --> 21:27.764
just to have all these
meetings back home.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.333
- What if I told you
I'm on holiday?

21:31.377 --> 21:34.031
- If this is you on holiday,
I'd hate to see you working.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.295
- If you must know,

21:36.338 --> 21:38.035
I'm here to sell the chalet.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.646
The sooner, the better.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.302
Or don't you understand
deadlines?

21:44.128 --> 21:46.174
- Well, that's one thing
I do understand.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.481
Excuse me, Your Highness.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.267
- Ooh, there you are, sir.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.877
I'll have you back online
in a jiff.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.158
Ha!

22:18.424 --> 22:20.382
- What in the world?!

22:22.993 --> 22:24.560
Ha!

22:34.440 --> 22:35.397
Excuse me?

22:36.529 --> 22:37.747
- Ha!

22:38.400 --> 22:40.271
- Excuse me, hello!

22:40.315 --> 22:42.839
Break!
- Good one, sir.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.365
- Yes, what is it?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.975
- Sorry to bother you. Um...

22:48.018 --> 22:49.716
- And now that you have?

22:49.759 --> 22:52.632
- Well... You guys
are doing amazing...

22:52.675 --> 22:53.850
...by the way.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.243
I'm just wondering
if there's a way

22:55.286 --> 22:56.462
this can work for all of us.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.115
Like, how much long
will it be?

22:58.159 --> 22:59.682
Or can you do it more quietly?

23:02.032 --> 23:04.383
- I have precisely, uh...

23:04.426 --> 23:05.819
- Thirteen minutes.
- Thirteen minutes

23:05.862 --> 23:07.298
for my workout, and you want us

23:07.342 --> 23:08.865
to fence more quietly?

23:08.909 --> 23:10.258
- Thirteen minutes?
That's great.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.781
No, never mind then. I-I just...

23:11.825 --> 23:13.957
Trying to get some writing done,
and it sounds like pirates

23:14.001 --> 23:15.089
have taken over the house.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.743
- Pirates.

23:16.786 --> 23:20.007
I'll have you know that fencing
is one of the oldest

23:20.050 --> 23:22.488
and most difficult sports
in the entire world.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.967
- As difficult
as trying to write

23:24.011 --> 23:25.665
while pirates are playing
outside your door?

23:25.708 --> 23:28.929
- Fencing is like chess
in motion.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.888
It is... It is sparring
with steel.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.108
- And writing is sparring
with words.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.807
And I think I just
got the last word in.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.287
Hmm.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.425
- Double time, even louder.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.475
- Evening, miss.
- Hey, Fritz.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.650
How was your day?

23:54.694 --> 23:56.173
- Oh, fine.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.785
His Highness is very busy.
Diplomatic calls,

23:58.828 --> 24:02.310
heads of state, tutoring
sessions on royal affairs.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.660
Is there something you need?
You look a bit out of sorts.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.184
- Oh, yeah, I'm just looking
for something.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.144
My idea book!

24:11.362 --> 24:13.539
- Oh, oh no! I'm so sorry!

24:13.582 --> 24:15.889
Oh, Henry was cold!
I thought it was scrap!

24:15.932 --> 24:17.238
Oh, I really am sorry!

24:17.281 --> 24:18.761
- What is all the ruckus?!

24:18.805 --> 24:20.894
- My notebook is in the fire!

24:20.937 --> 24:23.200
- Fritz! Be a good fellow.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.507
Go get some clean rags.
- Yes, sir.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.554
Oh! Uh...

24:33.341 --> 24:34.777
- Sorry about that.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.213
What was this anyway?

24:36.257 --> 24:39.869
- It's where I jot down my ideas
and it's ruined!

24:39.913 --> 24:42.481
- Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.047
Well, uh...

24:45.048 --> 24:46.528
Um...

24:46.572 --> 24:49.705
Surely, you can come up
with some new ideas.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.707
- Ideas aren't like crumpets!

24:51.751 --> 24:53.274
You can't just
send out for more!

24:57.191 --> 24:59.585
Oh, this is funny to you, huh?

24:59.628 --> 25:02.109
- No, I...

25:02.152 --> 25:03.850
I'm so sorry.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.504
A thousand pardons.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.030
- Um, you know what?
You look...

25:10.073 --> 25:11.553
Uh...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.295
You look lovely tonight,
Your Highness.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.731
Good night.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.038
- Uh...

25:19.692 --> 25:21.302
- She certainly speaks her mind.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.651
- Yes, she does.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.479
Should Ms. Tilson
speak to her, sir?

25:25.045 --> 25:26.873
- Actually...

25:26.916 --> 25:28.570
no.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.573
- You have a...
- What?

25:32.879 --> 25:34.228
- Never mind.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.143
- Ah.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.938
- Hey, Fritz.
- There you are. Wasn't sure.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.246
- Here and getting nowhere
with my writing.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.161
- Well, I hate to distract,

25:54.204 --> 25:55.945
but Ms. Tilson has asked
to see you.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.773
- Summoned, am I?

25:58.557 --> 25:59.819
I'll be right there.

25:59.862 --> 26:00.950
- Thank you.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.438
- Ms. Tilson, you rang?

26:10.481 --> 26:14.529
- Yes. The prince went into town
on some errands,

26:14.573 --> 26:17.184
but it's Tuesday,
and on Tuesday,

26:17.227 --> 26:19.926
the prince enjoys fresh
croissant and jam

26:19.969 --> 26:21.362
with is afternoon tea.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.625
- Where would I possibly
find fresh croissants?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.279
- Surely you can get them
in town.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.977
- It's a very small town.
- You are the caretaker.

26:28.021 --> 26:30.458
So please, take care of it.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.550
- Croissants? Sorry.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.596
We don't get much call
for them around here.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.600
But I do make pretzels too,
if you like treats with a twist.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.603
- No thank you. I'm in a bit
of a croissant emergency.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.039
It's a long story.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.910
- You look familiar.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.346
Have we met before?

26:49.390 --> 26:51.610
- I don't think so.
I just got here this week.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.220
- In town to do some skiing?

26:53.263 --> 26:54.656
- I wish.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.137
I'm the temporary caretaker
up at that big chalet

26:57.180 --> 26:58.747
on Skyview.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.097
I'm trying to get
some writing done.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.490
I'm an author.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.493
- You don't say!
Anything I may have heard of?

27:05.536 --> 27:08.496
- Just one novel so far.
Romance in the Rockies?

27:08.539 --> 27:11.804
- Stay right there!

27:15.590 --> 27:17.940
- What?!
- I love Romance in
the Rockies!

27:17.984 --> 27:19.725
It's the best book
I've read this year!

27:19.768 --> 27:21.857
- Amazing! I'm so glad
you like it!

27:22.379 --> 27:26.166
- About that, Emily Miller
right here in my donut shop!

27:27.384 --> 27:29.386
- So when's your next book
coming out?

27:29.430 --> 27:32.172
- As soon as I can get past
my writer's block, I'm afraid.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.392
- How do you come up with
the stories you write anyway?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.091
- That's a good question.

27:38.134 --> 27:41.137
Sometimes, inspiration comes
easily, and...

27:41.181 --> 27:42.661
sometimes it doesn't.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.534
But every now and then,
a spark just kind of pops up

27:46.577 --> 27:47.535
out of nowhere.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.713
Speaking of which...

27:51.757 --> 27:54.368
Are you making fresh
donuts any time soon?

27:54.411 --> 27:56.979
- I was just about to make
a batch when you came in here.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.416
- Think you could twist
a few into a croissant shape?

28:00.722 --> 28:02.768
- Oh, I see where
you're going with this.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.248
Well, because I liked
your book so much,

28:05.292 --> 28:07.686
I'll give it a try.
- Yes!

28:07.729 --> 28:09.992
- Got it.
- Thank you!

28:14.518 --> 28:17.783
- Ah, Wilson.
Thank you for meeting me here.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.741
Dreadfully sorry to keep
you waiting.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.178
Um, as I was saying
over the phone,

28:22.222 --> 28:24.050
I need work to start right away.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.574
Extremely fast, in fact.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.272
The house is starting
to be shown on Friday,

28:29.316 --> 28:32.145
which means the work must be
done by then at the chalet.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.061
- Okay, well, you sign
the check, and I'll get at it.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.020
Uh, here's the estimate
for the materials.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.457
As you can see,
we've got drywall,

28:40.501 --> 28:41.850
paint, et cetera.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.026
- Ah...

28:44.070 --> 28:47.726
Well, this seems a bit high.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.816
Especially here, this
five-figure start work fee?

28:50.859 --> 28:53.688
- Well, you wanted a rush job,
and I got more work

28:53.732 --> 28:54.907
than I can handle.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.604
Plus, I gotta charge you
a little bit extra

28:56.647 --> 28:58.084
to put you to the front
of the line,

28:58.127 --> 28:59.999
and materials are expensive.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.783
If you look at...
- Oh.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.223
- What are you doing here?

29:07.267 --> 29:09.182
- Uh, I was just picking up
some things.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.533
- Oh, um... Mr. Wilson,
this is Emily Miller.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.622
Emily's helping us out
at the chalet.

29:14.665 --> 29:15.797
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.190
I couldn't help but hear.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.713
That's great that you're so
in demand,

29:18.757 --> 29:19.758
Mr. Wilson.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.629
- Yeah, my crew and I,

29:21.672 --> 29:23.674
we just put up a roof
down the road.

29:23.718 --> 29:26.155
And we're working on a driveway
this morning.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.417
So we're pretty busy.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.636
- Really?

29:28.679 --> 29:30.290
That's... That's amazing,

29:30.333 --> 29:33.119
'cause usually, putting in
a new roof causes some calluses,

29:33.162 --> 29:35.948
and your hands look great!

29:35.991 --> 29:37.340
That's a good job.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.168
- Oh, uh...

29:39.212 --> 29:41.823
I wear really good gloves.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.651
- Oh. Okay.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.392
Same brand as your boots?

29:46.654 --> 29:48.917
It's just, for most people,

29:48.961 --> 29:51.224
putting in a new driveway
would cause their boots

29:51.267 --> 29:54.227
to get covered in tar,
and yours look really clean.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.664
That's really something.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.710
But anyway, if you can't waive
the big start fee,

29:59.754 --> 30:01.843
no hard feelings. We'll just go
with the guy yesterday.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.366
The estimate
was lower, right? Yeah.

30:03.410 --> 30:06.239
And you're so busy anyway,
so, it's nice to meet you.

30:06.282 --> 30:09.546
- Well, I'm sure
there's a little bit

30:09.590 --> 30:11.026
of wiggle room in there.

30:11.070 --> 30:14.508
Um, I can, you know, uh...

30:14.551 --> 30:16.771
Uh, no, I'm waiving the fee.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.339
- Wow.
- I'll waive the fee. Yeah.

30:19.382 --> 30:22.429
- Okay, good. Good. Good.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.389
But these look like retail
prices for paint and lumber.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.087
Oh, but with your
contractor's discount,

30:28.130 --> 30:30.263
we'll get like, what,
20 percent off?

30:35.224 --> 30:37.009
Sorry to meddle, Your Highness.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.402
I just couldn't stand there
and watch him take advantage

30:39.446 --> 30:40.882
of a naiïve...

30:40.926 --> 30:43.189
of, uh, a newcomer.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.845
- What makes you assume
that I'm some naiïve newcomer?

30:48.934 --> 30:49.978
- Well, for starters,

30:50.022 --> 30:52.024
if a contractor sees
you've got money,

30:52.067 --> 30:53.852
he may try to take it.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.375
So before you negotiate
next time,

30:55.418 --> 30:57.681
you might want to park
your fancy sports utility wagon

30:57.725 --> 30:58.900
down the street.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.902
- Yes, though,

31:00.946 --> 31:02.164
I see your point.

31:03.078 --> 31:06.299
And how come you know
so much about all that, um...

31:06.342 --> 31:07.778
work business?

31:07.822 --> 31:09.998
- Before I was an author,
I was actually an accountant

31:10.042 --> 31:12.087
for a big construction firm
in Denver.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.916
- Ah. Well, you were
very impressive.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.223
Oh, before I forget.

31:18.528 --> 31:21.096
This is for you.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.056
To replace the one
that went up in smoke.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.101
It may not have any
ideas in it yet,

31:26.145 --> 31:28.016
but given how quickly
you think on your feet,

31:28.060 --> 31:29.888
I'm sure it'll be filled up
in no time.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.194
- Thank you so much.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.197
- Oh no. Shh!
- What?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.677
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.113
- Um, it's...

31:38.157 --> 31:39.680
Nigel Bolan.

31:39.723 --> 31:40.986
He's a photo-taking gadfly

31:41.029 --> 31:42.857
for the Concordian
gossip pages.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.903
What's he doing here?
Oh, God.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.817
- Oh, maybe he's on vacation?

31:46.861 --> 31:49.255
- Ah, well, it's a little far
to go for skiing,

31:49.298 --> 31:51.126
but not for a photo.
He's coming this way, hurry.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.954
- Okay.
- Um... How about some brunch?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.738
- Um, sure.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.088
- This way.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.180
- You didn't have to do
all this, Your Highness.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.572
- It's the last I can do.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.313
And you don't have to call me
"Your Highness".

32:04.357 --> 32:07.447
- Oh. Is it your lordship then,
Your Highness?

32:07.490 --> 32:08.970
- Actually, just...

32:09.014 --> 32:10.667
plain "Henry" will do.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.583
- There's nothing plain
about you, but...

32:13.627 --> 32:15.934
I'll give it a try...

32:15.977 --> 32:17.109
Henry.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.502
- That's better.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.462
- So, why such lengths
to avoid Nigel?

32:22.505 --> 32:25.378
- He twists the simplest things
into scandals.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.293
Like my coming here,
he would spin it

32:27.336 --> 32:29.208
into some sort of
frivolous trip.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.775
- But why did you come here
yourself to sell the chalet?

32:31.819 --> 32:34.561
I mean, a guy like you could
just wave your royal scepter

32:34.604 --> 32:35.997
and say, "Get it done!"

32:36.041 --> 32:38.130
- Well, I think you're
confusing a scepter

32:38.173 --> 32:39.609
with a magic wand.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.002
And anyway,

32:41.046 --> 32:42.961
it's... it's complicated.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.487
- Well, I like a good story.
Try me.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.709
- My Uncle Chauncey built
this chalet years ago

32:52.753 --> 32:55.669
to escape the pressures
of the palace back home.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.628
And if the Winter Palace
must be sold,

32:58.672 --> 33:01.718
I need to ensure that it's sold
to the right buyer.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.677
- The Winter Palace?

33:03.720 --> 33:06.158
- Yes, it's my uncle's nickname
for the chalet.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.682
- Sounds like a place where
kings and queens hold court.

33:08.725 --> 33:10.379
- No, no, quite the contrary.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.729
Chauncey's door was open to all.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.819
No matter who you were,
royal or local,

33:15.863 --> 33:17.691
as soon as you walked
through that door,

33:17.734 --> 33:20.128
he made you feel like a king.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.349
For instance, if a local couple
couldn't afford to get married,

33:23.392 --> 33:26.308
Chauncey would grant them
the use of his little chapel.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.398
- So, what became
of Uncle Chauncey?

33:29.442 --> 33:30.965
- He passed away.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.402
Uh, five years ago.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.100
That was the last time
I was here.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.927
- I'm sorry.

33:37.928 --> 33:40.801
- He was in line for the crown,
but he stepped aside.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.543
My father became king,

33:43.586 --> 33:45.066
and now,
with my father retiring,

33:45.110 --> 33:47.242
I'm to be made king.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.940
So, all I can do is...

33:49.984 --> 33:53.161
ensure that this place
is sold to the right buyer.

33:53.205 --> 33:56.077
Someone who appreciates it
as much as I do.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.775
And all by the end of the week.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.302
And I suppose I...

34:04.694 --> 34:06.957
I needed to see it
one last time.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.180
- You are not at all
what I expected

34:12.224 --> 34:14.313
a prince to be like.
- Oh, yes?

34:14.356 --> 34:17.533
And what did you expect
a prince to be like?

34:17.577 --> 34:19.448
- I guess I thought
you would just be doing

34:19.492 --> 34:21.711
more prince stuff.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.278
You know?

34:23.322 --> 34:25.411
Shouldn't you be out,
you know,

34:25.454 --> 34:27.500
playing polo and dancing
at masquerade balls

34:27.543 --> 34:30.503
instead of working 24/7?

34:30.546 --> 34:32.026
- As prince,

34:32.070 --> 34:33.680
I head up the foreign ministry.

34:33.723 --> 34:37.292
I negotiate treaties,
I propose budgets,

34:37.336 --> 34:39.816
I... And as king,
I'll do even more.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.297
- I can see why you're
so obsessed with schedules.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.125
- You know...

34:46.171 --> 34:48.825
I think we may be able
to help each other.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.654
I need to get this place
ready to be sold

34:51.698 --> 34:53.047
by the end of the week,

34:53.091 --> 34:55.615
and I am disastrously
short-staffed.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.965
And you've clearly proven
yourself resourceful.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.967
- Thank you, but I really
should be writing

35:00.010 --> 35:01.229
whenever I can.

35:01.273 --> 35:03.057
- Well then, let me
propose a treaty to you.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.147
If you help me in the mornings,

35:06.191 --> 35:08.497
you can have the entire
afternoon free to write.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.196
- Okay.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.762
But on one condition.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.026
No more making fun
of my bunny slippers.

35:17.332 --> 35:18.594
- Hmm...

35:18.638 --> 35:20.509
- Deal?
- Deal.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.562
Alright, Mr. Wilson and his crew

35:29.605 --> 35:31.390
will be here soon to start work
in the living room.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.566
But in the meantime,
I'd like everything

35:33.609 --> 35:35.829
in this room to be catalogued

35:35.872 --> 35:38.962
to either be thrown away,
or donated.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.660
- There's a lot to go through.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.184
- Yes, there is. And...

35:43.228 --> 35:45.795
we're going to start
showing the house on Friday,

35:45.839 --> 35:48.450
so I want this room
empty by then.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.192
- But look at these treasures.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.847
Some of this has to be
personal to you.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.545
- There's no time
for sentimentality, I'm afraid.

35:57.198 --> 36:00.027
- Stiff upper lip, huh?
- Something like that.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.203
- Are you sure you want
to part with all this stuff?

36:02.247 --> 36:04.684
I mean, look at these carvings!

36:04.727 --> 36:07.426
These are amazing!
Who did these?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.299
- The name of the artist
escapes me.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.562
You don't honestly
like them, do you?

36:13.606 --> 36:16.174
- I do, they're beautiful!

36:16.217 --> 36:17.740
I've always loved sculptures.

36:17.784 --> 36:19.829
What is that quote
from Michelangelo?

36:19.873 --> 36:22.267
Something about how
the sculpture's already inside

36:22.310 --> 36:24.094
the block of stone,
and it's just waiting

36:24.138 --> 36:25.139
to be let out!

36:25.183 --> 36:27.141
- Be that as it may,
they can go.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.534
- Okay.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.362
- These can go.

36:30.405 --> 36:33.234
Oh, these chairs, they can go.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.628
- Oh my goodness.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.673
Look at this telescope!

36:37.717 --> 36:40.023
- Oh. Well, I forgot about that.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.982
Yeah.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.114
Chauncey and I used to, uh...

36:49.250 --> 36:50.599
But give it to charity.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.427
And the sooner, the better.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.477
- Hockey! Okay, I...

36:58.520 --> 37:00.914
I love hockey.
I used to play with my dad.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.350
I'm pretty good.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.831
- Yeah, Chauncey and I
used to play in the backyard

37:04.874 --> 37:06.441
using the whole of it as a rink,

37:06.485 --> 37:09.052
even in the summer,
when we'd use pinecones

37:09.096 --> 37:10.924
for pucks.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.971
Uh, but everything can go,
please.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.499
- You know, if you're gonna be
giving away all this stuff

37:20.542 --> 37:22.109
to charity,
shouldn't we first make sure

37:22.152 --> 37:23.632
it's in good working condition?

37:23.676 --> 37:25.591
- That's hardly a good use
of our time.

37:25.634 --> 37:28.289
- Could reflect poorly
on Concordia.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.075
A matter of national pride,
after all.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.475
Ah, this should do nicely.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.564
- I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.479
- Don't tell me you're afraid
of a little competition.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.046
- What? Oh, please!

37:46.089 --> 37:47.569
Don't make me laugh!

37:47.613 --> 37:49.354
No, no, it's just that, um...

37:49.397 --> 37:53.314
I-I have a call with
the lords at noon, so...

37:53.358 --> 37:56.099
- Does Concordia have
a national bird?

37:56.143 --> 37:58.145
- No, why?

37:58.188 --> 38:00.713
- 'Cause it sounds like
someone is chickening out.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.628
- Ha.

38:02.671 --> 38:03.933
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.329
- Uh... Your Highness?

38:08.373 --> 38:09.591
What are you doing?

38:09.635 --> 38:12.725
- I am defending Concordian
national honor!

38:12.768 --> 38:14.640
Or so I'm told.

38:14.683 --> 38:17.164
- But this...
Your schedule is full, sir!

38:17.207 --> 38:19.297
And there's so much work
to be done to prepare

38:19.340 --> 38:20.602
the chalet for sale!

38:21.777 --> 38:23.562
Do something!
- Like what?

38:23.605 --> 38:24.998
- I don't know, anything!

38:25.041 --> 38:27.870
- Sir, shall I hold your hat?
- Uh, no. Thank you.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.046
Oh God!
Good!

38:30.090 --> 38:31.613
- Ha!
- Ahh!

38:33.398 --> 38:35.922
Are you alright?
- Yeah. Help.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.227
- Yes, of course.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.490
Oh!
- Ahh!

38:38.533 --> 38:39.752
- Oh, sire!

38:43.233 --> 38:45.453
- How are you not
shivering right now?

38:45.497 --> 38:47.107
- Well...

38:47.150 --> 38:49.501
I have a stiff upper lip,
remember?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.111
- Mmm, right, yes.
- Because right now,

38:51.154 --> 38:53.809
it's frozen solid.

38:56.638 --> 38:58.118
- Thank you.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.251
- Sire, if you are quite done,

39:01.295 --> 39:03.776
there's quite a lot of work
to get done today.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.952
Isn't that right, Ms. Miller?

39:05.995 --> 39:07.345
- Yes, right.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.824
Of course.
- Right.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.089
- Thank you.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.878
- Just a different sort
of exercise today,

39:18.921 --> 39:20.401
Ms. Tilson. Surely you approve.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.272
- I'm not sure that I do.

39:22.316 --> 39:25.580
- But... Ms. Miller
is a breath of fresh air.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.190
Wouldn't you say?

39:27.234 --> 39:29.236
- We shall see.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.369
Clean this up, would you?
- Yes, ma'am.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.029
- Ah, Emily.
- Yes.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.335
- Hi.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.513
I trust you've recovered
from today's match.

39:45.557 --> 39:48.037
- I can just feel
my fingers again, yes.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.865
What are you doing up?

39:51.127 --> 39:52.694
- Going over a draft
of the treaty.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.522
When my father steps down
next week,

39:54.566 --> 39:55.958
I have to be ready.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.482
- I thought someone
only becomes king

39:57.525 --> 39:59.309
when an older king passes away.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.747
- Concordians are practical
people.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.313
Our charter states that a king

40:03.357 --> 40:06.316
may abdicate to make room
for the next one,

40:06.360 --> 40:10.495
to always ensure a ruler
at the peak of their abilities.

40:10.538 --> 40:11.757
- Hmm.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.673
- I've been...
preparing for years.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.025
- You never stop, do you?

40:19.068 --> 40:20.418
- I can't.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.422
My whole life has been
planned down to the letter.

40:24.465 --> 40:28.426
- And down to a suitable
princess as well, I understand.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.341
A certain Beatrix
from the kingdom next door?

40:31.385 --> 40:32.908
She's very beautiful.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.303
- I see you've been
reading online.

40:36.346 --> 40:37.913
- Yes.
- Well...

40:37.957 --> 40:40.394
Uh, Beatrix is no longer
in the picture.

40:41.482 --> 40:42.962
- Oh?

40:43.005 --> 40:44.311
What happened?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.487
- It's complicated.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.316
We're perfect, on paper.

40:49.359 --> 40:52.667
Just not in real life,
if that makes sense.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.191
- Believe me, it does.

40:55.757 --> 40:59.108
Yeah, I was dating a guy
in my writing program.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.328
We had everything in common.

41:01.371 --> 41:04.636
But after my first book sold,

41:04.679 --> 41:07.900
Michael didn't handle it well.

41:07.943 --> 41:11.425
He was jealous, and he broke up
with me last year.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.471
- Michael doesn't sound
like a gentleman.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.952
I'm sorry.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.998
- I think I'm better
with fiction than real life.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.390
- What's that?

41:20.434 --> 41:23.219
- Oh, this is my first chapter.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.656
- Mmm!
- Well, most of it.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.527
I'm stuck on a section.
It helps me to print it

41:26.571 --> 41:27.615
and read it on paper.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.574
- I imagine that's rather
difficult,

41:29.617 --> 41:32.925
making the transition
from accountant to writer.

41:32.968 --> 41:35.493
- Yes. I gave up a very
steady paycheck

41:35.536 --> 41:38.191
for something much less certain.

41:38.234 --> 41:41.324
But... I do love it.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.283
- Still, it must take
a lot of courage.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.546
- Right.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.679
- You know, if you'd ever
like a second opinion

41:47.722 --> 41:50.072
on those pages of yours,
I'd be happy to read them.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.597
- Really, I'm fine.
I already have a dozen

41:52.640 --> 41:54.512
competing opinions
in my own head.

41:54.555 --> 41:57.036
- Well surely, another pair
of eyes would help.

41:58.994 --> 42:02.041
- That's so sweet, but you don't
want to read my book.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.912
- I so rarely get
to read for fun,

42:03.956 --> 42:05.958
and I would gladly read
your pages.

42:06.001 --> 42:07.525
If you want.

42:08.700 --> 42:09.918
- Okay.

42:09.962 --> 42:12.312
Okay! Fine.

42:12.355 --> 42:14.444
Take it quick before
I change my mind.

42:22.365 --> 42:25.151
Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.763
- What a surprise.
You made your own tea!

42:28.807 --> 42:31.549
Impressive.
- Oh, yes.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.943
Speaking of surprises...

42:36.597 --> 42:38.207
I read your chapter.

42:38.860 --> 42:39.818
- And?

42:39.861 --> 42:41.341
- And, uh...

42:43.561 --> 42:45.127
I loved it.

42:45.171 --> 42:47.434
- Really?
- Yes, really.

42:47.477 --> 42:49.697
But there was a problem.
- What?

42:49.741 --> 42:51.656
- It ended halfway through.

42:53.005 --> 42:55.660
- Well, like I told you,
I'm stuck.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.749
- Oh, really.

42:58.706 --> 43:00.142
I have an idea.

43:00.186 --> 43:02.623
Just indulge me.

43:02.667 --> 43:05.017
- Does anyone ever do otherwise?

43:05.060 --> 43:06.105
- Oh, no.

43:06.888 --> 43:08.194
So...

43:08.237 --> 43:10.762
My Uncle Chauncey and I
used to have this game

43:10.805 --> 43:12.024
to invent stories.

43:12.067 --> 43:14.156
We'd take a snowball,
and we'd pack it

43:14.200 --> 43:17.769
in our bare hands,
and we'd pass it back and forth,

43:17.812 --> 43:19.901
until we thought
of the next phrase,

43:19.945 --> 43:23.383
but you have to do it
without your gloves.

43:23.426 --> 43:26.299
- But that would be freezing!
- Exactly.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.999
Ready?
- Sure.

43:31.043 --> 43:33.436
- Alright. Once upon a time...

43:34.220 --> 43:35.569
Now, you think
of the next phrase,

43:35.613 --> 43:37.397
and pass it back to me.
- There was a prince.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.529
- Uh... a wise prince.

43:40.487 --> 43:42.315
- Who liked giving orders.

43:42.358 --> 43:43.795
- Um...

43:43.838 --> 43:46.711
Uh, until he met
a most disagreeable visitor.

43:46.754 --> 43:50.192
- Who made him apologize
for his atrocious manners.

43:50.236 --> 43:53.935
- Uh, until she realized
that he was deeply insightful,

43:53.979 --> 43:56.198
and the problem, in fact,
lay with her.

43:56.242 --> 43:58.940
- Oh, you!
- Hey!

44:00.507 --> 44:02.596
That's not part of the game!

44:04.076 --> 44:06.252
- Wait...

44:06.295 --> 44:08.210
I just got a great idea
for my chapter.

44:08.994 --> 44:11.126
Uh, I just have to flesh it out.

44:11.170 --> 44:13.651
- You see, I told you this game
would knock something loose.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.741
Alright, so go! Write!
Be gone with you!

44:16.784 --> 44:18.177
- Aren't the painters
coming soon?

44:18.220 --> 44:19.308
- Don't worry about
the painters.

44:19.352 --> 44:20.875
- Really?
- Yes.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.964
- Thank you. Thank you!

45:30.205 --> 45:32.164
- What are you doing out here?

45:32.860 --> 45:34.949
- Well, what are you doing
out here?

45:34.993 --> 45:38.213
- Oh, I'm just finishing up
a sculpture

45:38.257 --> 45:40.433
I started years ago, and...

45:41.303 --> 45:43.610
Ah. I suppose I've lost
track of time.

45:43.653 --> 45:46.265
- What is this? Explain, please.

45:46.308 --> 45:47.875
- Well, um...

45:47.919 --> 45:50.312
I thought when this place

45:50.356 --> 45:52.358
has new buyers, that perhaps

45:52.401 --> 45:54.316
the owners would like
this little fellow

45:54.360 --> 45:56.275
living on their deck.
- No, no, I meant

45:56.318 --> 45:58.843
explain how you made this,
it's beautiful!

45:58.886 --> 46:00.758
- Ah, it's nothing, really.

46:01.236 --> 46:05.197
- Nothing? Oh, this
is something, alright.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.938
Wait a minute.

46:09.288 --> 46:11.464
Those were your carvings
in the storage room,

46:11.507 --> 46:12.378
weren't they?

46:13.858 --> 46:15.773
- It's just a hobby

46:15.816 --> 46:17.339
from a lifetime ago.

46:17.383 --> 46:20.212
You know, when I would
visit my uncle,

46:20.255 --> 46:21.909
and dream of being a sculptor

46:21.953 --> 46:23.868
and living an artist's life.

46:24.607 --> 46:26.609
- Well...

46:28.220 --> 46:29.830
Why can't you?

46:29.874 --> 46:32.485
- Kings don't have much time
for woodworking, I'm afraid,

46:32.528 --> 46:33.616
for one.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.314
And...

46:35.357 --> 46:37.316
after my coronation next week,

46:37.359 --> 46:41.799
it's time to put away
childish things.

46:42.538 --> 46:44.236
- But you have a sister.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.282
Couldn't she take
the throne instead?

46:47.326 --> 46:49.371
- Edwina's my younger sister,

46:49.415 --> 46:53.027
and... even though she's always
been a diplomat of sorts...

46:54.594 --> 46:56.901
Look...

46:56.944 --> 47:01.166
My country is expecting
me to rule.

47:01.209 --> 47:03.081
And I can't let them down.

47:03.124 --> 47:05.910
- So you'd sacrifice
your happiness

47:05.953 --> 47:07.476
and become king?

47:08.173 --> 47:10.001
- It's my royal destiny.

47:11.045 --> 47:13.352
And what's my happiness
compared to the happiness

47:13.395 --> 47:15.267
of a half a million people?

47:16.355 --> 47:18.748
- I may have misjudged you
a bit.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.537
Look, if this is your
last chance to enjoy

47:24.580 --> 47:26.191
the Winter Palace,

47:26.234 --> 47:28.236
maybe you should try
to have some fun.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.759
Same goes for your staff.

47:29.803 --> 47:31.283
- How do you mean?

47:31.326 --> 47:33.198
- You guys all work so hard,

47:33.241 --> 47:36.810
and if this is your last
time here,

47:36.854 --> 47:38.638
why not try to enjoy it?

47:41.336 --> 47:44.470
Isn't that what your uncle
would've wanted?

47:45.993 --> 47:47.734
- Yes.

47:49.170 --> 47:50.519
Yes, he would.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.176
You know, you're a bit of a...

47:55.220 --> 47:56.917
- Nuisance?
- No.

47:56.961 --> 47:59.224
I was going to say inspiration.

48:00.051 --> 48:02.880
And I will give
your words some thought.

48:03.793 --> 48:05.056
Thank you.

48:06.057 --> 48:07.710
- 'Til tomorrow then.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.480
- What is this?

48:38.524 --> 48:41.135
- Better take a look,
Ms. Tilson.

48:41.179 --> 48:45.183
- 10:45, spin class
and a spa day?

48:45.226 --> 48:46.358
What is this?!

48:46.401 --> 48:47.968
- I had one just like it
waiting for me.

48:48.012 --> 48:50.884
Though mine said skiing
instead of spa day,

48:50.928 --> 48:53.974
and a class in origami,
whatever that is.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.976
- This is someone's
idea of a joke?

48:56.020 --> 48:57.238
- Quite the contrary.

48:57.282 --> 49:00.024
- Ms. Tilson, you've made
schedules every day

49:00.067 --> 49:01.460
for me since I was five.

49:01.503 --> 49:04.202
- Well yes, that is my job,
to keep you on task,

49:04.245 --> 49:05.725
and you have meetings today.

49:05.768 --> 49:07.422
- Oh, I cancelled them.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.076
- No, you haven't.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.035
- I have the rest of my life
for meetings.

49:11.078 --> 49:14.473
This week, I am on vacation.

49:14.516 --> 49:16.605
And some things will just
have to wait.

49:16.649 --> 49:18.912
- What I think he's trying
to say is that both of you

49:18.956 --> 49:20.653
deserve a little fun!

49:20.696 --> 49:21.784
So, Fritz...

49:21.828 --> 49:24.265
lift ticket and origami class.

49:24.309 --> 49:26.006
And Ms. Tilson, the spin class
starts soon,

49:26.050 --> 49:27.660
don't be late.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.618
And the spa is expecting you
after that.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.274
- But the diplomatic pouch
just arrived,

49:33.318 --> 49:35.102
and the workers need
to be supervised.

49:35.146 --> 49:38.062
- Ms. Tilson. Are you disobeying
a royal order?

49:38.105 --> 49:39.672
- No, of course not.
- Good.

49:39.715 --> 49:41.848
Then Ms. Tilson, Fritz,

49:41.891 --> 49:43.284
enjoy your day off.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.332
- Ah...

49:48.289 --> 49:50.030
- Hmm. That went well.

49:50.074 --> 49:51.640
- Remains to be seen.

49:51.684 --> 49:53.294
- And what about you?

49:53.338 --> 49:56.036
What will the prince
do for fun?

49:56.906 --> 50:00.040
- I figured I'd help out
Wilson, here.

50:00.084 --> 50:02.695
That is, if you'll have me,
good man.

50:02.738 --> 50:05.828
- Lucky me.
- Yes, indeed.

50:05.872 --> 50:08.048
- If you really want to help me,
there's a few supplies

50:08.092 --> 50:10.181
you can get in town.
- Oh, fantastic.

50:11.617 --> 50:14.620
Emily, since you're not
writing 'til later,

50:14.663 --> 50:16.056
perhaps you care
to accompany me.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.232
- I would love to.

50:25.544 --> 50:28.286
- So, how's your book coming?
- It's going great.

50:28.329 --> 50:30.027
- Well, clearly your
writer's block came

50:30.070 --> 50:32.116
from you working too hard,
and you just needed

50:32.159 --> 50:33.508
to have some more fun.

50:33.552 --> 50:34.727
- Wait a minute.

50:34.770 --> 50:36.990
Suddenly you're the expert
in fun?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.296
Mr. Works-all-the-time?

50:38.339 --> 50:41.386
- Listen, I am the most fun.

50:41.429 --> 50:42.822
For instance, I can do this.

50:45.651 --> 50:47.392
- Well, maybe you shouldn't.
- Why not?

50:47.435 --> 50:48.828
Are you fun-shaming me?

50:48.871 --> 50:51.396
You're shaming my fun!

50:51.439 --> 50:53.398
How dare you?

50:54.399 --> 50:56.140
- You should let your fun side
out more often.

50:56.183 --> 50:58.403
- Oh yeah? Why should I do that?
Just to get shamed more?

50:58.446 --> 51:00.057
- You'd probably have
more friends.

51:00.100 --> 51:01.449
- I have plenty of friends.

51:01.493 --> 51:03.277
The problem is, they all
want something from me.

51:03.321 --> 51:05.932
Fame, favor, funding.

51:05.975 --> 51:07.368
The Three Fs.

51:08.413 --> 51:10.676
But you're very different.

51:11.416 --> 51:13.287
- I am?
- Yeah.

51:13.331 --> 51:16.160
You don't seem to want
anything from me at all.

51:18.075 --> 51:21.078
- Well that's...
that's not actually true.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.819
I want the rest of that pretzel.

51:23.863 --> 51:25.691
- Oh, no, you can't have it.
- I...

51:25.734 --> 51:27.084
- Shoot, shoot.
- Oh.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.956
Is it that reporter guy?
- Yes, yes, yes.

51:29.999 --> 51:32.872
It's Nigel.
Probably up to no good.

51:33.786 --> 51:35.353
I can just see the headline now.

51:35.396 --> 51:38.617
Pretzel prince prances
in streets with pretty peasant.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.185
- Excuse me?!
- Sorry. Uh, we should...

51:41.228 --> 51:43.143
- Yeah, let's just hurry up
and get out of here.

51:43.187 --> 51:44.666
- It's icy.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.712
Take my hand.

51:53.458 --> 51:54.981
- I don't think he followed us.

51:55.024 --> 51:56.156
Ah!

52:11.780 --> 52:13.304
- Ms. Tilson.

52:13.347 --> 52:15.175
- I could be wrong, sire,

52:15.219 --> 52:16.742
but I think we have a problem.

52:16.785 --> 52:18.091
- Clearly.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.484
The prince has been
missing meetings

52:19.527 --> 52:21.964
and not returning calls.

52:22.008 --> 52:23.923
This has gone on long enough,
Ms. Tilson.

52:23.966 --> 52:25.577
- Yes, but what can we do?

52:25.620 --> 52:27.970
- Well, the sooner
that chalet sells,

52:28.014 --> 52:30.364
the sooner Henry comes home.

52:30.408 --> 52:32.018
That's all there is to it.

52:32.061 --> 52:33.628
- Yes, sire.

52:33.672 --> 52:35.717
Leave it to me.

52:39.199 --> 52:41.332
- So, you replace the screen...
- Uh-huh.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.595
- And then you put the spline

52:43.638 --> 52:46.337
in the slot, and...

52:46.380 --> 52:48.469
Uh...

52:48.513 --> 52:50.210
- It's done!
- Well done.

52:50.254 --> 52:51.907
- Most ingenious.

52:51.951 --> 52:54.214
- So now you're doing
home repairs?

52:54.258 --> 52:55.955
- Well, at the palace,
they won't let me

52:55.998 --> 52:57.217
touch a thing.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.697
So now, the next time
something breaks,

52:58.740 --> 53:00.220
I won't have to call
the repairman.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.701
No offense.

53:03.571 --> 53:05.094
- Ms. Tilson!

53:05.138 --> 53:07.227
How was your spa day?

53:07.271 --> 53:08.794
- Perplexing.

53:08.837 --> 53:12.798
I had some sort of treatment
involving guacamole.

53:12.841 --> 53:14.365
Or was it guava?

53:14.408 --> 53:17.063
- Well, whatever it was,
you look wonderful.

53:19.935 --> 53:21.328
Who could that be?

53:21.372 --> 53:24.157
- Oh dear, I had a message
from the real estate agent

53:24.201 --> 53:25.898
while I was at the spa.

53:25.941 --> 53:27.987
They've sent a potential buyer!

53:28.030 --> 53:29.597
Apparently,
he's very interested.

53:29.641 --> 53:31.512
- But it's two days early,
we're not ready.

53:31.556 --> 53:33.558
- Well, I may have indicated
to the agent

53:33.601 --> 53:36.213
our intense timeline, sir.

53:36.256 --> 53:38.780
But don't worry,
I will take care of it.

53:38.824 --> 53:40.565
As you'll do to speak
to the prime minister

53:40.608 --> 53:42.393
in ten minutes.
- Reschedule that, please.

53:42.436 --> 53:44.743
I need to get a sense of who
might be buying this place.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.878
I'll handle it myself.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.583
So, as you can see,
there's quite a bit

53:58.626 --> 53:59.975
more work to do.

54:00.019 --> 54:01.977
We weren't quite expecting
you so soon.

54:02.021 --> 54:04.066
- I don't mind a little
paint and sawdust.

54:04.110 --> 54:06.025
Great place you've got here.

54:06.068 --> 54:08.462
- Thank you. My uncle
helped build it himself.

54:08.506 --> 54:10.159
It was a bit of
a passion project.

54:10.203 --> 54:13.511
In fact, he had these windows
installed at night

54:13.554 --> 54:14.729
for stargazing.

54:14.773 --> 54:16.470
- And during the day,
as you can see,

54:16.514 --> 54:18.298
the light in here is amazing.

54:18.342 --> 54:20.561
It's perfect for reading,
or just taking in

54:20.605 --> 54:22.041
this beautiful view.

54:22.084 --> 54:23.782
- Nice.

54:23.825 --> 54:26.132
Of course, I'd have
to make some changes.

54:26.175 --> 54:28.047
- Changes?
- Sure.

54:28.090 --> 54:29.570
Knock out some walls,

54:29.614 --> 54:31.006
put in a bar.

54:31.050 --> 54:34.314
And this room would be perfect
for a home theater.

54:34.358 --> 54:36.273
Just have to block out
those windows.

54:36.316 --> 54:39.319
- But then you'd miss
this gorgeous view.

54:39.363 --> 54:41.713
- It's a shame.

54:41.756 --> 54:43.497
But you can't make an omelette
if you don't break

54:43.541 --> 54:45.194
a couple eggs.

54:45.238 --> 54:47.196
- Um...

54:47.240 --> 54:50.330
Well, uh, before we proceed
too much further,

54:50.374 --> 54:52.332
you should be aware
of the risks.

54:52.376 --> 54:54.987
- Risks?
- Yeah, you know, the hazards.

54:55.030 --> 54:56.728
- What hazards?
- Uh...

54:56.771 --> 54:59.513
Well, there's the bears,
for one.

54:59.557 --> 55:02.124
- Bears?
- Oh, they love it here.

55:02.168 --> 55:04.475
- Why would bears love it here
more than any place else?

55:04.518 --> 55:06.041
- Oh-ho!

55:06.955 --> 55:09.306
- It could be because of
all the beehives in the eaves.

55:09.349 --> 55:11.830
- Mm, yes.

55:11.873 --> 55:14.136
Full disclosure,
I'm not sure my uncle

55:14.180 --> 55:16.400
got all the permits he needed
to build this place.

55:16.443 --> 55:17.966
- I'm sure that can be fixed.

55:18.010 --> 55:19.968
- And of course,
there is the fireplace

55:20.012 --> 55:21.230
in the main living room.

55:21.274 --> 55:23.363
Sometimes the chimney
just blows the smoke

55:23.407 --> 55:25.234
right back in there.
- Mm-hmm.

55:25.278 --> 55:27.324
- It's like London
in the 50s in there.

55:27.367 --> 55:31.502
Oh, and then, of course,
there is the roof. It leaks.

55:31.545 --> 55:32.938
Bad.

55:32.981 --> 55:35.201
- Are you trying to talk
me into this place

55:35.244 --> 55:36.985
or out of it? I'm not sure.

55:37.029 --> 55:39.031
- Look, I'm terribly sorry.

55:39.074 --> 55:42.817
I... I just don't think
this place is for you.

55:44.428 --> 55:46.604
- I understand.

55:46.647 --> 55:48.083
I appreciate your time.

55:48.127 --> 55:49.955
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

55:49.998 --> 55:51.304
- Of course.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.306
- Have a good day.
- You as well.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.612
That's the door.

55:54.655 --> 55:57.136
Thank you for all those
fascinating stories!

56:01.662 --> 56:04.448
- You forgot to mention
the potential for meteor impact.

56:04.491 --> 56:07.451
- Ha. Well, I'll remember that
for when he comes back.

56:07.494 --> 56:08.800
Thank you for the assist.

56:08.843 --> 56:11.498
Uh, just simply
not the right buyer.

56:11.542 --> 56:13.370
- B-But to sell this place soon,

56:13.413 --> 56:15.023
isn't any buyer the right one?

56:15.067 --> 56:16.895
- I just need to find someone

56:16.938 --> 56:19.158
who loves this place
as much as I do.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.553
- I mean, I get it.
Nobody wants to see

56:22.596 --> 56:24.468
their memories bulldozed.

56:24.511 --> 56:27.296
And your uncle did help
build this place.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.602
- Yeah.

56:28.646 --> 56:30.038
Speaking of...

56:30.082 --> 56:32.867
There is something
that I have been dying to do!

56:38.438 --> 56:39.874
- Your Highness,

56:39.918 --> 56:41.485
you've been at this
for a while.

56:41.528 --> 56:43.574
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

56:43.617 --> 56:45.532
- Look, if my Uncle Chauncey
could help build

56:45.576 --> 56:47.752
this entire chalet
with his own two hands,

56:47.795 --> 56:50.624
then truly, I can change
a light switch or two.

56:50.668 --> 56:52.452
- But Henry, we don't want
you to get shocked.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.193
- Ms. Tilson does have a point.

56:54.236 --> 56:56.238
- Be careful, sir.
- Alright, look.

56:56.282 --> 56:58.676
I watched Wilson do
one of these earlier,

56:58.719 --> 57:00.982
it is perfectly fine. Alright?

57:01.026 --> 57:03.507
- So you know what you're doing?
- Obviously.

57:04.333 --> 57:06.858
I'm almost done. And...

57:07.424 --> 57:08.903
Ahh!

57:09.600 --> 57:10.862
Woops.

57:12.254 --> 57:14.909
- Hey! Who's up for
a candlelight dinner tonight?

57:18.913 --> 57:22.090
- So, long story short...

57:22.134 --> 57:23.831
I must've crossed the wires.

57:23.875 --> 57:26.225
- Well, I think it all
worked out perfectly.

57:26.268 --> 57:28.140
This is lovely.

57:28.183 --> 57:31.273
- I agree. It's a bit romantic,
isn't it?

57:31.317 --> 57:33.319
Speaking of romantic,

57:33.362 --> 57:35.843
better clear these dishes.
I have a date later.

57:35.887 --> 57:38.280
- A what? With who?

57:38.324 --> 57:40.674
- The ski instructor who gave me
my lessons this morning.

57:40.718 --> 57:43.764
By the way, sire. I set up
the telescope like you asked.

57:43.808 --> 57:46.027
- The telescope from storage?

57:46.724 --> 57:49.117
- Oh, uh, yes. I...

57:49.161 --> 57:51.598
The mountain air is perfect
for stargazing.

57:51.642 --> 57:53.470
And it's a clear night, so...

57:54.471 --> 57:55.950
Would you care to join me?

57:55.994 --> 57:57.778
- Yeah.

57:57.822 --> 57:59.824
Yeah, I mean, you know,

57:59.867 --> 58:01.347
maybe I'll get more inspiration.

58:01.390 --> 58:04.481
- But sire, it's chilly out,
and late.

58:04.524 --> 58:07.048
And none of us
want to catch a cold

58:07.092 --> 58:08.223
before the coronation.

58:08.267 --> 58:09.747
- So you can stay warm

58:09.790 --> 58:11.096
by the fire with a book.

58:12.445 --> 58:14.273
That's a royal order.

58:19.844 --> 58:21.889
After you.
- Thank you.

58:27.199 --> 58:30.681
- Henry certainly seems
to have lost his focus.

58:30.724 --> 58:34.989
- Perhaps. But he hasn't smiled
this much in ages.

58:38.863 --> 58:41.822
- Ms. Tilson means well,
but she and my father

58:41.866 --> 58:45.826
conspire to protect me
from all this.

58:47.045 --> 58:48.437
- It's amazing.

58:48.481 --> 58:50.091
It's like you could see forever.

58:50.135 --> 58:51.310
- Indeed.

58:51.353 --> 58:52.659
- Oh, yes.

58:52.703 --> 58:54.269
Wow.

58:56.837 --> 58:58.578
- Do you see that star there?

58:58.622 --> 59:00.014
Right in the heart of Leo?

59:00.058 --> 59:01.320
- Yes.

59:02.147 --> 59:04.671
- So that is Regulus.

59:05.367 --> 59:08.588
My Uncle Chauncey used to say
that that was my star.

59:08.632 --> 59:11.852
Because Regulus in Latin
means "little prince".

59:13.724 --> 59:16.378
- In Latin, wouldn't regulus
mean "little king"?

59:17.336 --> 59:20.034
- Well yes, if you want
to get technical about things.

59:20.078 --> 59:21.645
I suppose it would
mean little king.

59:21.688 --> 59:23.647
- Oh, the book
The Little Prince.

59:23.690 --> 59:25.300
The Latin translation
was called...

59:25.344 --> 59:26.432
Regulus.

59:29.391 --> 59:31.785
- I think I would've
liked your uncle.

59:32.438 --> 59:33.918
- You would've.

59:34.832 --> 59:37.138
His house here was...

59:37.182 --> 59:38.923
just magic.

59:38.966 --> 59:41.142
People would come here
and no matter

59:41.186 --> 59:44.102
what sort of mood they were in,
they would leave happy.

59:44.145 --> 59:46.321
- Maybe it's working
its magic on me.

59:47.453 --> 59:50.499
My book seems to be
writing itself.

59:50.543 --> 59:52.240
- Does that mean
you'll make your deadline?

59:52.284 --> 59:55.243
- Yes, yes, I think so,
if I keep up this pace.

59:55.287 --> 59:57.463
I just haven't quite
figured out the end.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.160
- What about,

59:59.204 --> 1:00:02.816
"Journeys end
in lovers meeting"?

1:00:04.252 --> 1:00:06.080
- Your Highness.

1:00:06.864 --> 1:00:10.215
Quoting Shakespeare?
- Oh, it's my favorite.

1:00:10.258 --> 1:00:14.654
It's as true now
as it was 400 years ago.

1:00:15.742 --> 1:00:17.526
And that's what people want.

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:19.964
For a couple to end up together.

1:00:21.139 --> 1:00:23.271
- Sometimes it's easier
said than done.

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:30.627
So...

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:33.107
Three days. You're leaving
in three days, huh?

1:00:33.151 --> 1:00:34.587
- It would seem so.

1:00:35.457 --> 1:00:37.677
This coronation business
can't be stopped.

1:00:39.113 --> 1:00:40.985
- Your royal destiny?

1:00:42.943 --> 1:00:45.859
But your future
isn't set in stone.

1:00:47.078 --> 1:00:48.993
Why can't you...

1:00:49.036 --> 1:00:51.082
write your own story?

1:00:52.736 --> 1:00:55.564
- I wish I had your courage.

1:00:57.218 --> 1:00:59.830
- Tonight let's just...

1:00:59.873 --> 1:01:02.093
enjoy the stars.

1:01:06.227 --> 1:01:09.056
- I'm afraid I've been
unsuccessful, Your Majesty.

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.668
- I understand.
Henry can be very stubborn.

1:01:12.277 --> 1:01:15.367
You'll have to take
stronger measures.

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:22.069
- Father...

1:01:22.113 --> 1:01:24.202
The mayors are gathering
for the morning tea downstairs

1:01:24.245 --> 1:01:26.639
in the library.
Weren't you to meet them?

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:28.380
- Yes, Edwina,
I'll be there shortly.

1:01:29.076 --> 1:01:30.643
- Well, it's been quite a week.

1:01:32.123 --> 1:01:33.428
Is something wrong, Father?

1:01:34.255 --> 1:01:36.997
- No. No, I just need to make
some arrangements

1:01:37.041 --> 1:01:39.260
to take care of a...

1:01:39.304 --> 1:01:41.132
a pressing matter.

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:53.710
- Your Highness?

1:01:55.886 --> 1:01:57.931
Is everything alright?

1:02:00.107 --> 1:02:03.676
- I was just thinking
what Chauncey must have felt

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.852
when he first stumbled
upon this place.

1:02:06.897 --> 1:02:09.726
All the possibilities
open to him.

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:13.686
- All is well, sir?

1:02:14.382 --> 1:02:16.428
- Better than well.

1:02:16.471 --> 1:02:18.169
That's the problem.

1:02:19.344 --> 1:02:21.738
For the first time in my life,

1:02:21.781 --> 1:02:25.350
I have a choice
that I never expected.

1:02:26.394 --> 1:02:28.919
A choice like my Uncle Chauncey
had to face.

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:34.011
- If you don't mind my saying,
sir...

1:02:35.839 --> 1:02:37.884
your uncle was a wise man.

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:56.773
- You sure you want to do this?

1:02:56.816 --> 1:02:58.035
- Yes.

1:02:58.078 --> 1:03:00.559
I am determined to make dinner
for everyone,

1:03:00.602 --> 1:03:01.952
just like Chauncey.

1:03:01.995 --> 1:03:04.998
- Yeah, but you really
want to attempt, uh...

1:03:05.042 --> 1:03:07.566
- Beef Wellington. No?

1:03:07.609 --> 1:03:10.612
- I-It just seems like that
would be really challenging.

1:03:10.656 --> 1:03:12.658
- The Duke of Wellington
was a distant relation.

1:03:12.701 --> 1:03:14.791
I'm just hoping
it might come naturally.

1:03:14.834 --> 1:03:16.270
- You know what?

1:03:16.314 --> 1:03:18.969
I could teach you how to make
my world-famous fajitas.

1:03:19.012 --> 1:03:20.448
- That's easier?
- I think so.

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:22.407
And it's the one thing
I know how to make.

1:03:22.450 --> 1:03:23.800
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:03:26.367 --> 1:03:27.586
Oh.

1:03:27.629 --> 1:03:28.805
- What?

1:03:28.848 --> 1:03:30.154
- Hungry?
- Yeah!

1:03:30.197 --> 1:03:32.896
These are Concordian apples.
Try one!

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:48.128
- Um...

1:03:48.172 --> 1:03:51.697
- So... that was Emily's recipe.

1:03:51.740 --> 1:03:54.743
- But prepared entirely
by Henry.

1:03:55.483 --> 1:03:56.876
- Yes. Haha.

1:03:57.964 --> 1:04:01.446
And I, uh, want to know

1:04:01.489 --> 1:04:03.535
exactly what you think.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.668
Really.
- Really?

1:04:06.712 --> 1:04:08.453
- No holds barred.

1:04:08.496 --> 1:04:10.063
- No holds barred?

1:04:10.107 --> 1:04:13.284
- Absolutely. I'm tired
of being "yessed" all the time.

1:04:15.155 --> 1:04:17.114
- Well, sire,

1:04:17.157 --> 1:04:20.508
I think since you asked us
to speak freely,

1:04:20.552 --> 1:04:23.729
I would, well...

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:27.211
- You did quite a job
cooking the meat, sir.

1:04:27.254 --> 1:04:29.256
- Yes.
- The texture reminded me

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:30.692
of...

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:36.481
...a wallet I once owned.

1:04:53.106 --> 1:04:55.108
- Oh. It...

1:04:55.152 --> 1:04:56.414
It was tough.

1:04:58.459 --> 1:04:59.896
- Come on, it was your first
time cooking.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:02.246
- Yeah. So says Ms. Grey Eggs
over here.

1:05:06.206 --> 1:05:08.295
- True, true. Yeah, we should
open a restaurant.

1:05:08.339 --> 1:05:10.907
- Oh yes, we'd be quite
the pair.

1:05:11.777 --> 1:05:14.345
Lines around the block,
I'm sure.

1:05:15.824 --> 1:05:18.392
- It's been quite a week.
- Yes, it has.

1:05:18.436 --> 1:05:21.308
I should thank you for, um...

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:25.138
just reminding me.

1:05:25.182 --> 1:05:26.313
- Of what?

1:05:26.357 --> 1:05:28.098
- Of what apparently
I'd been missing.

1:05:28.141 --> 1:05:32.102
This laughter, music, life.

1:05:32.145 --> 1:05:34.626
I've had an amazing visit.

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:37.585
- Me too. I, uh...

1:05:37.629 --> 1:05:41.198
I actually wrote something

1:05:41.241 --> 1:05:44.897
for you... just to read
after you've gone home.

1:05:49.467 --> 1:05:51.382
- But maybe I...

1:05:51.425 --> 1:05:55.647
don't want to go home.

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:58.824
- Yeah, I get it.

1:05:58.867 --> 1:06:00.782
It's like when you
read a great book,

1:06:00.826 --> 1:06:02.262
and you don't want it to end.

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:05.396
- That's precisely my point.

1:06:07.746 --> 1:06:09.878
Maybe it doesn't have to end.

1:06:11.663 --> 1:06:13.317
- What do you mean?

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:16.581
- Perhaps with some imagination,

1:06:16.624 --> 1:06:18.800
a way can be found.

1:06:18.844 --> 1:06:20.933
- But I leave tomorrow,

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:22.326
a-and you...

1:06:22.369 --> 1:06:24.371
- Perhaps I could delay
my trip a bit.

1:06:25.285 --> 1:06:26.808
- But your coronation.

1:06:26.852 --> 1:06:29.855
- Honestly, I'm not thinking
about any of that right now.

1:06:30.334 --> 1:06:31.988
- Henry!

1:06:33.380 --> 1:06:35.992
Apparently, I've arrived
just in time.

1:06:37.167 --> 1:06:40.648
Henry and I have an urgent
matter to discuss.

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:46.089
- Father, I can't believe
you actually came all this way.

1:06:46.872 --> 1:06:49.005
- What can I say, Henry?

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:51.398
It seems you needed my help.

1:06:52.747 --> 1:06:55.141
- I'm not sure that's true.

1:06:55.185 --> 1:06:59.363
- Well, you came here
to sell the Winter Palace.

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:01.669
Has it been sold?

1:07:03.106 --> 1:07:06.674
- Well no, not yet,
but I just need more time.

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:08.981
Besides, the coronation
isn't until next week.

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:11.505
- Yes, well,
that's the problem, Henry.

1:07:11.549 --> 1:07:13.681
There is no more time.

1:07:13.725 --> 1:07:15.074
- Ah.

1:07:17.816 --> 1:07:20.036
Look, Father...

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.346
I've been thinking.

1:07:26.390 --> 1:07:30.611
Edwina has done
astonishing work in my absence.

1:07:30.655 --> 1:07:32.526
So I've been told.

1:07:32.570 --> 1:07:35.486
And if you'll remember,
the treaty was her idea.

1:07:35.529 --> 1:07:39.794
She speaks multiple languages,
she spearheads charities,

1:07:39.838 --> 1:07:41.666
I think she actually wants--

1:07:41.709 --> 1:07:44.886
- Henry, that is not
for you to decide.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:54.766
It's an honor to serve.

1:07:54.809 --> 1:07:56.637
- Yes.

1:07:56.681 --> 1:07:58.857
- And I won't hear anything more
to the contrary.

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:01.120
- Father, you wanted
an ordinary life, didn't you?

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:02.295
Before you became king.

1:08:02.339 --> 1:08:04.123
- Yes, but when Chauncey
stepped down,

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:05.690
there was no other
choice for me.

1:08:05.733 --> 1:08:08.127
- But don't you ever regret
not taking that life?

1:08:08.171 --> 1:08:11.261
- Your mother and I did
what we had to for the nation.

1:08:11.304 --> 1:08:13.132
As must you too.

1:08:13.176 --> 1:08:15.352
Concordia must have
its new ruler,

1:08:15.395 --> 1:08:16.744
as soon as possible.

1:08:16.788 --> 1:08:18.790
- And what, you're worried
that I might run away?

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:22.054
- Yes, well...
Once was enough with Chauncey.

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:26.928
- The chancellor
and Lord Chamberlain

1:08:26.972 --> 1:08:28.234
will be arriving here tomorrow.

1:08:28.278 --> 1:08:29.670
- What? Why would they
come here?

1:08:29.714 --> 1:08:31.542
- Because the coronation
will take place here.

1:08:31.585 --> 1:08:32.804
The day after tomorrow.

1:08:32.847 --> 1:08:34.153
In the chapel.

1:08:34.197 --> 1:08:36.677
- What?! Why?

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:39.724
- Rumors back home, Henry.

1:08:39.767 --> 1:08:43.293
Rumors that you're getting
cold feet.

1:08:43.336 --> 1:08:46.470
Concordia must have its monarch.

1:08:46.513 --> 1:08:48.428
The prime minister wants
the coronation done now,

1:08:48.472 --> 1:08:50.604
and honestly, Henry,

1:08:50.648 --> 1:08:52.171
I agree.

1:08:52.215 --> 1:08:54.391
- But it can't happen here.

1:08:56.132 --> 1:08:58.438
The coronation must happen
on Concordian soil.

1:08:58.482 --> 1:09:00.962
- Well, since embassies
are considered the territory

1:09:01.006 --> 1:09:02.660
of the nation they represent,

1:09:02.703 --> 1:09:06.229
you are going to temporarily
transfer the chalet's deed

1:09:06.272 --> 1:09:09.188
to our embassy here.

1:09:09.232 --> 1:09:12.235
And then, after the coronation,

1:09:12.278 --> 1:09:15.238
they will sell this place
at long last.

1:09:23.463 --> 1:09:25.161
- You two kissed?
- I mean, no.

1:09:25.204 --> 1:09:27.554
Not, like, technically no.
But almost!

1:09:27.598 --> 1:09:29.687
And Becca, I don't know
what to do.

1:09:29.730 --> 1:09:31.036
I mean, my week's almost up,

1:09:31.079 --> 1:09:32.646
and my book needs
all of my attention.

1:09:32.690 --> 1:09:35.823
And Henry's about to become
the king of a country in Europe

1:09:35.867 --> 1:09:37.738
in a few days!
I mean, this is ridiculous!

1:09:37.782 --> 1:09:40.132
It should never
have gotten this far.

1:09:41.612 --> 1:09:43.353
But...

1:09:43.396 --> 1:09:46.094
I am falling for him, Becca.

1:09:46.921 --> 1:09:49.010
I think I'm in love.
- Emily...

1:09:49.054 --> 1:09:52.623
Slow down. There's something
you should know.

1:09:52.666 --> 1:09:55.408
I saw a story online
from some tabloid.

1:09:55.452 --> 1:09:57.758
It's got a photo
of you in it together.

1:09:57.802 --> 1:10:00.239
- Oh. What does it say?

1:10:00.283 --> 1:10:03.286
- "Snow prince melts hearts,
while back home,

1:10:03.329 --> 1:10:06.158
Princess Beatrix is stewing
amid rumors

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:09.117
of engagement announcement
soon going out."

1:10:09.161 --> 1:10:11.207
- Engagement? No, no...

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:12.947
Henry said that relationship
was over.

1:10:12.991 --> 1:10:14.340
- Are you sure?

1:10:14.384 --> 1:10:16.951
It says here that they're
on again, off again,

1:10:16.995 --> 1:10:18.257
but they're back on,
and the announcement

1:10:18.301 --> 1:10:19.476
is soon coming out.

1:10:19.519 --> 1:10:20.738
- What?

1:10:20.781 --> 1:10:22.827
- Yeah. And there
are more headlines.

1:10:23.567 --> 1:10:26.222
"Is Prince Henry on a date
in the U.S.?"

1:10:26.265 --> 1:10:29.137
"What will fiancée
Princess Beatrix think?"

1:10:29.181 --> 1:10:33.316
"Can Concordia afford a royal
scandal at this critical time?"

1:10:33.359 --> 1:10:35.056
Do you want to hear more?

1:10:35.622 --> 1:10:37.276
- No, it's okay.

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:39.104
I've heard enough.

1:10:44.414 --> 1:10:46.285
- Emily!

1:10:48.374 --> 1:10:49.941
- Uh...
- You're leaving?

1:10:49.984 --> 1:10:52.465
- Yeah, I was just about
to find you to say goodbye.

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:53.727
- What's the rush?

1:10:53.771 --> 1:10:55.468
- You know, Henry,
I have a book to finish

1:10:55.512 --> 1:10:57.035
and a life in Boulder.

1:10:57.078 --> 1:11:00.343
And you have a life...

1:11:00.386 --> 1:11:01.996
waiting for you.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.738
You have an entire
nation waiting for you.

1:11:04.782 --> 1:11:08.481
And, uh... obligations
that I'm just

1:11:08.525 --> 1:11:10.788
distracting you from.

1:11:10.831 --> 1:11:12.398
Goodbye, Henry.

1:11:15.619 --> 1:11:19.449
- Surely goodbye
doesn't have to be farewell.

1:11:20.493 --> 1:11:21.668
- Please don't make this
any harder

1:11:21.712 --> 1:11:23.191
than it already is.

1:11:36.422 --> 1:11:37.554
- Ms. Miller.

1:11:39.338 --> 1:11:41.558
- Oh, Your Majesty.

1:11:42.210 --> 1:11:46.737
- I just wanted to commend you
for doing the right thing.

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.132
You know, I was kept informed
of the, uh...

1:11:51.176 --> 1:11:52.786
well, the shenanigans.

1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:56.137
And so, I must confess,
I imagined you to be

1:11:56.181 --> 1:11:57.878
a bit frivolous.

1:11:59.184 --> 1:12:02.318
But you're not at all
as I assumed.

1:12:04.885 --> 1:12:08.106
I guess one mustn't
judge a book by its cover.

1:12:09.934 --> 1:12:11.501
- Thank you.

1:12:13.459 --> 1:12:16.680
I want to apologize
for last night.

1:12:17.942 --> 1:12:21.685
I now know that Henry's going
to be engaged to Beatrix, so...

1:12:22.729 --> 1:12:25.297
Anyway, I should probably go.
I'm sure you have lots of things

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:27.386
to attend to before
you head home to Concordia.

1:12:27.430 --> 1:12:29.257
- Ms. Miller.

1:12:29.301 --> 1:12:31.172
You may think me harsh,

1:12:31.216 --> 1:12:33.523
but you must understand

1:12:33.566 --> 1:12:36.439
Concordia must have its king.

1:12:38.005 --> 1:12:40.356
- I just hope
it gets a happy one.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.452
- Couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

1:12:49.495 --> 1:12:52.237
Made this for you.
- Thank you, Fritz!

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:53.456
Origami.
- It's beautiful!

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:55.196
- Just my little way
of saying thank you.

1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:56.937
- Thank me? For what?

1:12:56.981 --> 1:12:59.157
- For starters, introducing me
to my new girlfriend.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:01.855
That ski instructor I met
on our fun day,

1:13:01.899 --> 1:13:04.075
will come visit me
in Concordia this summer.

1:13:04.118 --> 1:13:06.207
- Fritz, I'm so happy for you!

1:13:06.251 --> 1:13:08.993
I wish you nothing but the best.

1:13:11.735 --> 1:13:13.954
Ms. Tilson.
- Ms. Miller.

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:16.435
Well, I don't know what to say.

1:13:16.479 --> 1:13:17.871
It's a bit awkward.

1:13:17.915 --> 1:13:20.874
Maybe I'm succumbing
to the altitude.

1:13:20.918 --> 1:13:22.485
- Come here.

1:13:28.316 --> 1:13:30.841
- You really are
a breath of fresh air.

1:13:32.451 --> 1:13:34.061
- Thank you.

1:13:35.889 --> 1:13:37.543
Safe travels home.

1:13:38.152 --> 1:13:39.458
- Goodbye.

1:13:59.130 --> 1:14:01.524
- Welcome home, stranger.
- Thanks.

1:14:02.699 --> 1:14:04.962
- Back one day, and already
looking busy.

1:14:05.005 --> 1:14:08.008
- I was busy,
up until just a moment ago.

1:14:10.228 --> 1:14:12.273
And... send.

1:14:12.317 --> 1:14:14.406
- Did you just do
what I think you did?

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:15.407
- Yes!

1:14:16.364 --> 1:14:19.019
I just sent my entire
manuscript to the publisher.

1:14:19.063 --> 1:14:22.283
I-I can't believe it, I'm done!
I'm done!

1:14:22.327 --> 1:14:24.808
- I knew you could do it.
- Oh!

1:14:25.678 --> 1:14:27.941
- So, what's next?

1:14:29.943 --> 1:14:31.771
- Good question.

1:14:32.337 --> 1:14:35.688
- Emily, I'm sorry
that I roped you into all this.

1:14:35.732 --> 1:14:37.342
- No, I...

1:14:37.385 --> 1:14:40.519
No, I should thank you,
actually.

1:14:40.563 --> 1:14:41.825
- Really?

1:14:42.695 --> 1:14:47.134
- It was the most beautiful,
inspiring adventure.

1:14:48.658 --> 1:14:50.573
And I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

1:14:56.927 --> 1:14:58.450
- Thank you.

1:14:59.059 --> 1:15:00.539
- Come now, sire.

1:15:00.583 --> 1:15:02.280
Why so glum?

1:15:02.323 --> 1:15:04.891
This is a great day
of celebration for our country.

1:15:04.935 --> 1:15:06.719
- Of course, it will be.

1:15:06.763 --> 1:15:08.852
- These, sire?
- No, the black, please.

1:15:08.895 --> 1:15:10.462
With the patent leathers.
- Yes, sire.

1:15:12.377 --> 1:15:14.553
- Oh, you're looking
every bit a king, Henry.

1:15:14.597 --> 1:15:16.642
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Now, if only we could

1:15:16.686 --> 1:15:18.470
get him to smile.

1:15:22.039 --> 1:15:23.344
- So?

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.478
Are you ready?

1:15:26.522 --> 1:15:28.698
- Yes, as I'll ever be.

1:15:32.092 --> 1:15:34.573
- I, uh, thought after
the coronation,

1:15:34.617 --> 1:15:37.707
it might be wise
to announce the new treaty.

1:15:37.750 --> 1:15:40.318
A bright start to your reign.

1:15:40.361 --> 1:15:42.581
- Hmm? Oh...

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:44.627
Oh yes, the treaty.

1:15:44.670 --> 1:15:46.933
That's a good idea.
Let's do that.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:50.415
- Your mind seems elsewhere,
Henry.

1:15:51.372 --> 1:15:53.200
Is something the matter?

1:15:53.244 --> 1:15:56.116
- No. Everything's well, Father.

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:59.293
- Henry, for what it's worth,

1:15:59.337 --> 1:16:01.165
I liked her too.

1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:05.822
I chatted with Ms. Miller
before she left.

1:16:05.865 --> 1:16:09.782
She's very smart.
A delightful young woman.

1:16:10.522 --> 1:16:12.176
- Yes.

1:16:13.873 --> 1:16:15.701
But, uh...

1:16:17.137 --> 1:16:19.575
In the end...

1:16:21.272 --> 1:16:22.839
...what I thought we had
was a fiction.

1:16:23.970 --> 1:16:25.581
- I see.

1:16:27.365 --> 1:16:29.889
- I should really keep
working on my speech.

1:16:30.498 --> 1:16:32.762
- Yes. Of course.

1:16:35.939 --> 1:16:37.549
What's that?

1:16:39.551 --> 1:16:41.335
- It's something Emily gave me.

1:16:42.075 --> 1:16:44.643
- Listen, Henry.

1:16:45.426 --> 1:16:47.777
I failed to clear up
a misunderstanding

1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:51.737
that Ms. Miller had
regarding your...

1:16:51.781 --> 1:16:53.521
engagement with Beatrix.

1:16:55.959 --> 1:16:58.701
I wasn't sure what to say.

1:16:58.744 --> 1:17:01.486
And so, I didn't say anything.

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.664
- Oh. Well...

1:17:09.668 --> 1:17:11.409
It's alright.

1:17:13.237 --> 1:17:16.719
- Well, I should...
I should go.

1:17:16.762 --> 1:17:18.677
And...

1:17:19.547 --> 1:17:20.766
leave you to it.

1:17:26.685 --> 1:17:29.166
- "A note for a king."

1:17:37.783 --> 1:17:41.308
"Every block of stone
has a statue in it.

1:17:41.352 --> 1:17:44.747
And it is the task of
the sculptor to discover it.

1:17:46.139 --> 1:17:48.489
Never doubt your courage.

1:17:50.056 --> 1:17:52.232
P.S.

1:17:52.276 --> 1:17:54.713
That's a royal order."

1:17:55.845 --> 1:17:58.891
- Brother. The coronation
begins in four hours.

1:18:00.371 --> 1:18:02.112
Are you quite alright?

1:18:11.077 --> 1:18:13.427
- You know what? Now that
I've got this book on the way,

1:18:13.471 --> 1:18:15.168
I think I want to just
jump into the next one.

1:18:15.212 --> 1:18:18.084
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You know, I'm on a roll.

1:18:18.128 --> 1:18:19.738
- Any idea what that might be?

1:18:19.782 --> 1:18:21.609
- Uh...

1:18:22.523 --> 1:18:24.656
I actually started
outlining a few stories.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:25.918
But I...

1:18:26.832 --> 1:18:29.748
I left my new idea book
up at the chalet.

1:18:29.792 --> 1:18:31.750
- Well, you need to go get it.

1:18:31.794 --> 1:18:33.665
- I know. I know, I just...

1:18:33.709 --> 1:18:35.841
I-I don't want to go up there
if Henry's still there,

1:18:35.885 --> 1:18:37.887
and I don't know exactly
when they're leaving.

1:18:37.930 --> 1:18:39.889
Do you know?
- They must've left,

1:18:39.932 --> 1:18:42.108
because I saw a news alert today
that said

1:18:42.152 --> 1:18:43.806
the coronation's happening
today.

1:18:44.502 --> 1:18:46.417
So, if they're in Concordia,

1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:47.897
the chalet must be empty
right now.

1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:49.333
- Okay.

1:18:49.376 --> 1:18:51.204
- Are you gonna go?

1:18:51.683 --> 1:18:53.250
Do you want me to go with you?

1:18:53.293 --> 1:18:55.643
- You know, you have to get
back to work in a few minutes,

1:18:55.687 --> 1:18:57.210
and I think I just
want to go now,

1:18:57.254 --> 1:18:58.646
and just get on with it.

1:18:58.690 --> 1:19:01.824
Besides, it'll be night
before I get there.

1:19:42.865 --> 1:19:46.564
As I step down,
I turn to you,

1:19:47.478 --> 1:19:50.002
my eldest child, Prince Henry,

1:19:50.046 --> 1:19:52.570
to ask if you will
assume the throne

1:19:52.613 --> 1:19:55.181
as defender of the realm,

1:19:55.225 --> 1:19:57.270
King of Concordia.

1:19:58.054 --> 1:20:00.317
Carrying out your duties

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:02.319
with all your heart.

1:20:04.277 --> 1:20:05.496
Please.

1:20:05.539 --> 1:20:07.628
Make your proclamation.

1:20:13.896 --> 1:20:16.855
Our most
hallowed tradition

1:20:16.899 --> 1:20:19.640
is the passing
of the Concordian crown

1:20:19.684 --> 1:20:21.686
from one monarch to the next.

1:20:23.557 --> 1:20:26.996
And while it is tempting
for us to grieve

1:20:27.039 --> 1:20:29.259
as one chapter ends...

1:20:31.087 --> 1:20:34.046
we must also celebrate
as another begins.

1:20:36.222 --> 1:20:40.226
To rule Concordia requires
a full and honest heart.

1:20:42.533 --> 1:20:45.101
The truth is...

1:20:46.885 --> 1:20:50.193
The truth is, my heart
belongs somewhere else.

1:20:50.236 --> 1:20:53.283
And because I cannot give
Concordia my full heart,

1:20:53.326 --> 1:20:56.677
I cannot be your king.

1:20:58.766 --> 1:21:00.899
Someone who is very dear to me

1:21:00.943 --> 1:21:04.860
reminded me of something
that I had learned long ago.

1:21:05.817 --> 1:21:10.126
Every stone has a statue in it.

1:21:10.169 --> 1:21:13.825
Just... waiting to be
discovered.

1:21:15.261 --> 1:21:17.263
Life is this way.

1:21:18.743 --> 1:21:20.614
We cannot see our futures

1:21:20.658 --> 1:21:24.923
any more than we can see
a statue trapped in stone.

1:21:24.967 --> 1:21:27.665
And yet, chip by chip,

1:21:27.708 --> 1:21:30.102
our lives begin
to reveal themselves

1:21:30.146 --> 1:21:33.584
until they are released
from their blocks.

1:21:33.627 --> 1:21:35.673
Thus...

1:21:35.716 --> 1:21:37.588
we are faced with a choice

1:21:38.676 --> 1:21:40.939
to carve out a life worth living

1:21:40.983 --> 1:21:43.811
or to be carved out
by life itself.

1:21:44.508 --> 1:21:48.338
Now, the choice before me today
is to continue down a path

1:21:48.381 --> 1:21:50.862
that I know in my heart
is wrong.

1:21:53.734 --> 1:21:57.347
The Princess Edwina
is far more capable

1:21:57.390 --> 1:21:59.349
and more passionate,

1:21:59.392 --> 1:22:01.438
and better suited
to rule Concordia

1:22:01.481 --> 1:22:03.831
than I could ever hope to be.

1:22:05.398 --> 1:22:07.183
That is, if she's interested.

1:22:09.533 --> 1:22:11.709
- I thought you'd never ask.

1:22:16.714 --> 1:22:19.238
- My son is quite right.

1:22:20.022 --> 1:22:23.112
Concordia must have its monarch.

1:22:24.374 --> 1:22:26.463
And so it shall.

1:22:26.506 --> 1:22:28.813
Not a king,

1:22:28.856 --> 1:22:31.294
but a queen.

1:22:35.907 --> 1:22:38.954
Long live the queen!

1:22:39.519 --> 1:22:41.782
Long live the queen!

1:22:43.567 --> 1:22:45.221
Sorry to put you
on the spot, Eddie,

1:22:45.264 --> 1:22:46.526
but I knew you could handle it.

1:22:46.570 --> 1:22:47.875
- Are you joking?

1:22:47.919 --> 1:22:49.921
This is the most fun
I've had all year!

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:52.402
- Perhaps not a typical
coronation,

1:22:52.445 --> 1:22:54.491
but...

1:22:54.534 --> 1:22:56.580
I believe the right one.

1:23:02.978 --> 1:23:04.501
- Emily.

1:23:08.070 --> 1:23:11.377
Go to her.
That is a royal order!

1:23:14.598 --> 1:23:16.556
- I know why you left.

1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:19.472
But Beatrix and I broke up,
but the palace kept the breakup

1:23:19.516 --> 1:23:21.213
quiet because we felt that
a public breakup

1:23:21.257 --> 1:23:22.649
might erode support
for the treaty between

1:23:22.693 --> 1:23:24.782
our two nations, but anyway,
none of that matters,

1:23:24.825 --> 1:23:26.392
because I'm not
going to be king,

1:23:26.436 --> 1:23:28.351
and Edwina's going to sign
the treaty tomo--

1:23:28.394 --> 1:23:29.787
Why are you hiding
behind a flag?

1:23:29.830 --> 1:23:33.051
- Oh, um... I-I...

1:23:33.095 --> 1:23:36.141
I came back to get
the book you gave me.

1:23:36.185 --> 1:23:37.360
Uh...

1:23:37.403 --> 1:23:39.144
The coronation?

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:40.711
- Yeah.
- W-What...

1:23:40.754 --> 1:23:42.626
What does it mean?

1:23:42.669 --> 1:23:44.454
Are you staying?

1:23:44.497 --> 1:23:46.325
- Only if you stay.

1:23:47.718 --> 1:23:50.460
You and this place
are all I've ever wanted.

1:23:50.503 --> 1:23:53.811
- What about your royal destiny?

1:23:57.119 --> 1:23:59.251
- I wanted to write
my own story.

1:24:00.470 --> 1:24:02.863
One where the couple
ended up together.

1:24:05.301 --> 1:24:07.042
- I guess Shakespeare was right.

1:24:08.391 --> 1:24:10.958
Journeys do end
in lovers meeting.

1:24:27.149 --> 1:24:28.759
difuze
