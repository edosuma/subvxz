what the doctor wants.

00:22.628 --> 00:24.794

Take your time.

00:50.906 --> 00:52.322
All right, dear.

00:52.324 --> 00:54.974
Is the, uh,
is the manager in?

00:54.976 --> 00:56.643
I was just hoping to get
a job application.

00:56.645 --> 01:00.914
Honey, that's the third time
you've been in this week.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.982
I'm sorry, he's not hiring.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.156
Uh, try down at the Nugget.
I think they're looking for someone.

01:10.158 --> 01:11.541
They're not.

01:13.628 --> 01:14.928
Ooh! Sorry.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.996
Excuse me.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.551
What are you gonna do?

01:21.553 --> 01:23.169
Times are tough
for everyone.

01:23.171 --> 01:24.471
Tell me about it.

01:24.473 --> 01:26.389
I'm barely getting
one booking a month.

01:26.391 --> 01:28.725
Well, if Frida doesn't
show up soon,

01:28.727 --> 01:31.194

and hire the kid.

01:31.196 --> 01:32.946

It doesn't, really.

what you pay.

02:33.575 --> 02:36.509

gonna pay for that,

why do you
want to help me?

02:46.755 --> 02:50.223
You remind me of someone.

02:50.225 --> 02:53.259
Ah, gotcha. I remind you of you
when you were young

02:53.261 --> 02:56.279
and just starting out
or some crap like that, right?

02:56.281 --> 02:59.098
Word of advice, Finn.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.785
If someone offers
to help you...

Oh, my God.

03:28.012 --> 03:30.263
The bodies of two
unidentified women

03:30.265 --> 03:32.182
were found in the desert

03:32.184 --> 03:34.317
just outside of the good doctor's
hometown, Las Vegas.

03:34.319 --> 03:36.069
They were stripped
of their I.D.

03:36.071 --> 03:37.737
One looks like
she was killed yesterday,

03:37.739 --> 03:39.239
the other a couple
of weeks ago.

03:39.241 --> 03:40.740
According
to the M.E. report,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.609
both women were
in their 30s, and--

03:42.611 --> 03:44.611
is this cause
of death right?

03:44.613 --> 03:46.479
Yes, and I have
confirmed it.

03:46.481 --> 03:48.815
Both women drowned.

03:48.817 --> 03:50.784
How far is the nearest
body of water?

03:50.786 --> 03:52.502
The Hoover Dam, Lake Mead,
like 60 miles.

03:52.504 --> 03:55.255
So we're looking at
a disposal site.

03:55.257 --> 03:57.457
Were they sexually
assaulted?

03:57.459 --> 03:59.426
No, but they did both
suffer blunt force trauma

03:59.428 --> 04:01.594
and severe antemortem abrasions
to the wrists and ankles.

04:01.596 --> 04:04.631
That means they were most likely
held somewhere before they were killed.

04:04.633 --> 04:07.350
Or maybe they were bound
so they could be tortured

04:07.352 --> 04:08.468
With water.
Rossi: She's right.

04:08.470 --> 04:10.854
We can't rule out
waterboarding

04:10.856 --> 04:12.355
or being held underwater
in a pool or a bathtub,

04:12.357 --> 04:14.524
it's possible
this unsub's a sadist.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.175
The woman killed yesterday
was wearing a uniform.

04:16.177 --> 04:17.844
She could have been
a waitress or a maid.

04:17.846 --> 04:19.728
There are 93 hotels
in Las Vegas,

04:19.731 --> 04:21.680
260 motels and inns,

04:21.683 --> 04:24.350
1,510 bars, and 2,996
restaurants.

04:24.352 --> 04:27.186
Not to mention nearby Summerlin,
which is growing in popularity.

04:27.188 --> 04:29.739
Well, local P.D. has ruled out the
major establishments.

04:29.741 --> 04:31.357
They're combing through
the smaller ones now

04:31.359 --> 04:32.709
to see if they can find
a match.

04:32.711 --> 04:35.528
The other Jane Doe
was pretty decomposed.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.714
Clothing looks ordinary.

04:37.716 --> 04:39.582
Is that a fanny pack
she's wearing?

04:39.584 --> 04:41.167
Yes, and it was empty.

04:41.169 --> 04:42.869
It means she was probably
a tourist, though.

04:42.871 --> 04:47.891
Last year Las Vegas documented
39,727,022 visitors.

04:47.893 --> 04:50.376

06:36.325 --> 06:37.624
There's something strange
about the disposal site.

06:37.626 --> 06:40.827
It would seem like he took
the bodies into the desert

06:40.829 --> 06:42.295
to hide them,
but he chose a spot

06:42.297 --> 06:45.048
next to an old construction site
that's for sale.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.300
He had to imagine that someone
would show up eventually.

06:47.302 --> 06:49.753
So was he hiding the bodies
or displaying them?

06:49.755 --> 06:50.837
It could be both.

06:50.839 --> 06:52.723
He might be hiding them
from law enforcement

but displaying them
to another group.

on the most recently
deceased victim,

06:57.813 --> 07:00.180
Frida Bancroft, 34.
She was working as a waitress

07:00.182 --> 07:01.848
at Della Rose's grill
downtown.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.517
Manager said she'd been
there for two months,

07:03.519 --> 07:05.635
and I just sent you
a picture.

07:05.637 --> 07:07.938
Did she exhibit unusual
behavior recently,

07:07.940 --> 07:09.990
or was she involved
with anyone suspicious?

07:09.992 --> 07:11.525
Well, the manager said
he took a chance

07:11.527 --> 07:13.527
by hiring her because
she's a former drug addict

07:13.529 --> 07:14.861
with a spotty work history,

07:14.863 --> 07:17.164
and when she didn't show up
to work for the last 3 days,

07:17.166 --> 07:18.648
he figured she had
started using again.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.483
But we know she didn't,
because the M.E. report

07:20.485 --> 07:21.835
says the tox screen
was negative.

about the waitress,

and Blake and I will go
to the Vegas P.D.

Were there any recent
changes in Frida's life?

07:40.472 --> 07:45.508
No. Other than signing
a new apartment lease a week ago.

07:45.510 --> 07:48.344
She'd been saving up
all the money she made here

07:48.346 --> 07:50.864
for the last couple of months
to pay for the security deposit.

07:50.866 --> 07:53.867
It takes a lot of discipline
to do that so quickly.

07:53.869 --> 07:55.235
What about friends and family?

07:55.237 --> 07:56.820
Was she in a relationship?

07:56.822 --> 07:59.973
She never talked about
her past or her personal life.

07:59.975 --> 08:04.027
It's almost like she wanted
the slate clean.

08:04.029 --> 08:05.879
Ok, thanks.

08:05.881 --> 08:07.080
Thank you.

08:08.249 --> 08:09.466
Frida seemed determined

08:09.468 --> 08:11.301
to start a new life
for herself,

08:11.303 --> 08:12.836
and we know
she wasn't using.

08:12.838 --> 08:14.004
She had to be hiding

08:14.006 --> 08:15.338
or running away
from something.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.306
I agree.

08:16.308 --> 08:17.808
Maybe she owed
her dealer money

08:17.810 --> 08:21.311
and was pulled back
into the drug world.

08:21.713 --> 08:23.880
The owners don't like it,

08:23.882 --> 08:26.616

they can do about it.

08:26.618 --> 08:28.585

and drink here.

08:28.587 --> 08:32.222
Vagrants come out to collect empty
beer bottles and cans.

08:32.224 --> 08:34.756
So this location actually
gets a lot of visitors.

08:34.759 --> 08:36.676
More than you'd expect
in the middle of the desert.

08:36.678 --> 08:38.595
It's probably
because this is here.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.230
People like to have
a landmark to go to.

08:40.232 --> 08:41.681
Where exactly
were the bodies found?

08:41.683 --> 08:44.601
The waitress was about
5 yards from the main sign.

08:44.603 --> 08:48.104
The tourist was
200 yards that way.

08:53.327 --> 08:54.994
This isn't completely dry.

08:54.996 --> 08:56.613
There are drops of paint
on the ground.

08:56.615 --> 08:58.081
This was done recently.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.616
Whoever it was
must have seen the body.

08:59.618 --> 09:01.084
It'd be hard to miss here.

09:01.086 --> 09:03.703
It was probably some kid
too scared to report it.

09:03.705 --> 09:05.371
2/10 could be a tagger name
or a gang sign.

09:05.373 --> 09:06.706

familiar to you?

09:06.708 --> 09:08.007
No.

09:08.009 --> 09:09.876
2 out of 10.

09:09.878 --> 09:11.844
It's possible
the unsub wrote this.

09:11.846 --> 09:13.513
There were two
victims here.

09:13.515 --> 09:15.348
Which means
there could be 8 more.

09:15.350 --> 09:18.301
He might be operating
off a hit list.

09:18.303 --> 09:21.104

can't abide lies?

10:07.902 --> 10:09.218
That's worth a lot.

10:09.220 --> 10:12.054
And you got grift sense.
It just needs to be honed.

10:12.056 --> 10:15.224
I'm helping you
because you can help me.

10:15.226 --> 10:19.061
Those are the terms.

10:22.082 --> 10:24.083
Hey, we've been walking
forever.

10:24.085 --> 10:25.952
Where is your place,
anyway?

10:25.954 --> 10:27.870
Right here.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.877
Toss me your bag.

10:44.438 --> 10:46.105
You live down here?

10:46.107 --> 10:48.474
For now, until my plan
works out.

10:48.476 --> 10:50.476
How long you been here?

10:50.478 --> 10:51.761
A couple years.

10:51.763 --> 10:53.780
Most of these folks
have been living here longer.

10:53.782 --> 10:55.314
This is Mary.
Terrific steer.

10:55.316 --> 10:56.649
She chooses the targets.

10:56.651 --> 10:59.101
Gladys is the stall.

10:59.103 --> 11:02.288
And Olsen
is a damn good wire.

11:02.290 --> 11:06.442
The guy who actually
lifts the goods.

11:06.444 --> 11:08.444
So you all steal together.

11:08.446 --> 11:09.796
Sometimes.

11:09.798 --> 11:12.298
Home sweet home.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.052
You can stay next door.

11:16.054 --> 11:17.754
This was Frida's place.

11:17.756 --> 11:19.856
She moved out.
Hey!

11:20.924 --> 11:23.142
The doctor wanted this
cleaned up.

11:23.144 --> 11:25.628
Actually, I was hoping
my friend

11:25.630 --> 11:29.515
could use it, Cesar.
This is Finn.

11:29.517 --> 11:32.185
I'm vouching for him.

11:33.303 --> 11:35.137
Ok, then.

11:35.139 --> 11:36.606
Welcome to Paradise.

11:38.108 --> 11:40.326
These tunnels
used to be dangerous.

11:40.328 --> 11:41.944
About a year ago,

11:41.946 --> 11:44.480
Cesar cleaned up
this whole section.

11:44.482 --> 11:45.615
How?

11:45.617 --> 11:50.203
By establishing
some much needed order.

11:50.205 --> 11:51.487
Why'd you have to
vouch for me?

11:51.489 --> 11:53.989
Every good system
needs its rules.

11:53.991 --> 11:56.709
The first rule is,
you don't join us

11:56.711 --> 11:59.328
unless someone
vouches for you.

11:59.330 --> 12:03.332
He said the doctor
wanted this cleaned up.

12:03.334 --> 12:04.884
Who's that?

12:07.771 --> 12:08.888
The Doctor

12:08.890 --> 12:10.556
is someone
Cesar works for.

12:10.558 --> 12:12.842
No one's ever met him,
though.

12:12.844 --> 12:15.344
Cesar's a little off,
but we let him go

12:15.346 --> 12:17.613
considering all the good
he's done.

12:17.615 --> 12:20.083
Just don't cross him.

12:24.621 --> 12:26.989
This is from 16 days ago.

12:26.991 --> 12:29.191
You can see she's wearing
the same clothing as the first victim.

12:29.193 --> 12:31.043
Yeah,
it's definitely her.

12:31.045 --> 12:33.529
Casino I.D.'D her
as Renee Sheffield of Omaha.

12:33.531 --> 12:35.548
She applied for
a job 3 years ago as a hostess

12:35.550 --> 12:38.334
but didn't make the cut.
There's no known address for her.

12:38.336 --> 12:41.003
Any I.D. on the boyfriend
or husband who's with her?

12:41.005 --> 12:43.389
There's no hits
on the facial recognition system.

12:43.391 --> 12:47.042
Does anyone at the casino remember
seeing or talking to them in person?

12:47.044 --> 12:50.379
Good luck with that.
They get thousands of guests a week.

12:50.381 --> 12:53.766
Hold on. Can you rewind that
about 5 seconds?

12:53.768 --> 12:55.234
Take a look at Renee.

12:56.653 --> 12:57.987
She's stealing.

12:57.989 --> 13:00.556
She's a strip-miner.

13:00.558 --> 13:02.942
I can't believe
I missed that.

13:02.944 --> 13:05.611
Strip-miners take money
or chips left behind

13:05.613 --> 13:07.563
or unwatched
by careless tourists.

13:07.565 --> 13:09.064
They dress to look like
tourists themselves

13:09.066 --> 13:11.066
so that they're not spotted
by casino security.

13:11.068 --> 13:13.402
So the fanny pack
is a prop.

13:13.404 --> 13:15.588
How many strip-miners
are there?

13:15.590 --> 13:17.573
Hard to say.
Hundreds at least.

13:17.575 --> 13:19.675
There's no shortage
of desperate people here.

13:19.677 --> 13:21.243
A lot of grifters
work in teams.

13:21.245 --> 13:23.913
It's possible the man
with her is just a partner.

13:23.915 --> 13:26.549
Maybe the partnership
went bad and he killed her.

13:26.551 --> 13:28.584
The dead waitress
could be part of the team as well

13:28.586 --> 13:29.969
if they all stole
together.

13:29.971 --> 13:31.771
We need to get an I.D.
on the man.

13:31.773 --> 13:34.040
Please tell your team
that's our top priority.

13:50.942 --> 13:52.992
I'm gonna teach you
a few things.

13:52.994 --> 13:54.777
The first is called
a pattern interrupt.

13:54.779 --> 13:56.779
The brain has learned
certain actions

13:56.781 --> 13:58.631
like shaking hands
or tying a shoe

13:58.633 --> 14:01.117
as one single motion.

14:01.119 --> 14:02.284
If you interrupt it
in the middle,

14:02.286 --> 14:04.503
the brain can't pick up
where it left off.

14:04.505 --> 14:08.624
It's a moment where
suggestion can enter.

Good evening,

you're gonna open your eyes

14:40.792 --> 14:43.759

they were homeless.

20:46.561 --> 20:48.561
They may have known each other
from the street or from a shelter.

20:48.563 --> 20:51.731
The disposal site of the first
two victims served a dual purpose.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.532
It was meant to hide
the bodies from law enforcement

20:53.534 --> 20:55.117
but at the same time
put them on display

20:55.119 --> 20:57.737
for the people that
the message was intended for.

20:57.739 --> 21:00.873
All of this suggests
a group or organization at work,

21:00.875 --> 21:03.409
but it doesn't have
the hallmarks of organized crime.

21:03.411 --> 21:06.045
The victims seen
on surveillance video

21:06.047 --> 21:08.197
weren't stealing
large sums of money,

21:08.199 --> 21:10.916
so we're dealing with
a much smaller community.

21:10.918 --> 21:13.052
But this group operates
by a strict code,

21:13.054 --> 21:15.254
and any violation
of that code can result in death.

21:15.256 --> 21:17.056
JJ: You should be
on the lookout for groups

21:17.058 --> 21:18.874
that operate
robberies and cons together.

21:18.876 --> 21:22.211
Blake: The group has a strong leader
who does not tolerate dissent.

21:22.213 --> 21:25.214
This leader appears normal
and comfortable in social situations.

21:25.216 --> 21:28.217
He may even be extroverted
and charismatic like a cult leader.

21:28.219 --> 21:31.070
He'll have grandiose delusions
and believe that he is special.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.772
He may even believe that
he can communicate with God

21:32.774 --> 21:34.406
or some other
higher powers.

21:34.408 --> 21:36.659
He will attempt
to surround himself with people

21:36.661 --> 21:39.394
who are subservient,
either sycophantic followers or people

21:39.396 --> 21:40.913
who are trapped
by financial constraints.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.498
How's he recruiting
these people?

21:42.500 --> 21:45.668
It's likely he attracts followers
by offering some assistance.

21:45.670 --> 21:49.004
But as his power grows,
so will his narcissism.

21:49.006 --> 21:51.340
He'll begin to make
increasingly extreme demands.

21:51.342 --> 21:54.293
He'll want more attention,
which could be why his latest victim

21:54.295 --> 21:55.911
was found in a very
public place.

21:55.913 --> 21:58.047
With the choice of this
latest disposal site,

21:58.049 --> 22:00.766
it indicates that he's growing bolder
and more careless.

22:00.768 --> 22:03.085
He has lost 3 followers.
He's gonna need new recruits.

22:03.087 --> 22:06.272
So we should step up patrols in areas
where the homeless population gathers.

22:06.274 --> 22:07.439
Thank you.

22:09.559 --> 22:13.612
I used to have 10, well,
maybe 15 cats at one point.

22:13.614 --> 22:15.931
Now all I got is noodle.
His mom was nipsey.

22:15.933 --> 22:17.900
Uh, have you seen Marvin?

22:17.902 --> 22:21.237
Marvin?
No, not since last night.

22:21.239 --> 22:22.454
[Bell clanging]

22:22.456 --> 22:24.273
What's going on?

22:24.275 --> 22:26.492
It's tax day.
I gotta go.

22:42.392 --> 22:44.960
Hmm. 45.

22:44.962 --> 22:46.595
Very good, Gladys.

22:46.597 --> 22:49.648
I'll be sure
and tell the doctor.

22:55.689 --> 22:57.973
12 dollars.

22:57.975 --> 22:59.308
Is that it?

22:59.310 --> 23:00.492
Yeah, that's all,
Cesar.

23:00.494 --> 23:02.077
You sure about that?

23:02.079 --> 23:04.163
Cesar, I swear.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.315
Because someone with
the initials Mary Carter

23:06.317 --> 23:08.417
told me you cleaned up
at the Luxor Friday night.

23:08.419 --> 23:09.835
Oh, no, that's not true.

23:09.837 --> 23:13.038
You know, I'd really hate
to tell the doctor about any of this.

23:14.007 --> 23:16.342
You know how he gets.

23:16.344 --> 23:18.994
You remember what happened
to Frida,

23:18.996 --> 23:20.379
Renee, and Elijah?

23:20.381 --> 23:21.797
That's because
they tried to leave.

23:21.799 --> 23:24.633
Without paying their taxes.
That makes them thieves.

23:25.685 --> 23:28.270
But I sure do miss them.

23:30.307 --> 23:33.692
Here, take it all.
Go ahead.

23:36.646 --> 23:38.647
Doctor only wants
his fair share.

23:42.402 --> 23:43.685
Who are you?

23:43.687 --> 23:46.538
Uh, my name is Sarah.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.324
Someone invite you?

23:48.326 --> 23:49.408
No. I'm new.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.377
I just need a place
to stay for a while

23:51.379 --> 23:55.581
until I can buy a bus ticket
back home to Minnesota.

23:55.583 --> 23:58.200
Can anyone vouch for you?

23:58.202 --> 24:00.336
Look, if no one
can vouch for you--

24:00.338 --> 24:02.471
I can.

24:02.473 --> 24:04.423
I know her.

24:08.478 --> 24:11.146
All right.

24:11.148 --> 24:13.899
Tax day's over.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.905
Well, other than gender, one other
thing's different about this victim.

24:19.907 --> 24:22.241
These fresh abrasion
marks on the neck.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.742
Strangulation?

24:23.744 --> 24:25.527
That's your cause of death.
No sign of drowning here.

24:25.529 --> 24:27.388
Drowning his victims was
a unique signature.

24:27.413 --> 24:28.531
Why change it now?

24:28.532 --> 24:30.399
Maybe he didn't have
the time or means to drown him,

24:30.401 --> 24:31.900
or the unsub
could be devolving.

24:31.902 --> 24:33.369
The diatom results
are back

24:33.371 --> 24:35.754
on the water in the lungs of the
first two victims.

24:35.756 --> 24:36.922
This is interesting.

24:36.924 --> 24:39.708
1,900 milligrams of lead,
320 milligrams of--

24:39.710 --> 24:41.353
Do you mind if I just
take a peek at this?

24:41.378 --> 24:43.046
It'll be quicker.

24:43.047 --> 24:44.170
This isn't drinking water.

24:44.195 --> 24:45.799
It's contaminated with
ground pollutants.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.416
It's like storm-water
runoff.

24:47.418 --> 24:49.885
So the unsub killed him
in a gutter?

24:49.887 --> 24:51.850
My guess would be
the floodwater control

24:51.875 --> 24:53.732
tunnels beneath the city.

24:54.442 --> 24:56.091
Thanks for saying
you know me.

24:56.093 --> 24:58.978
Yeah, no problem.
I'm, uh, I'm new here, too.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.595
So, who vouched for you?

25:00.597 --> 25:02.448
This guy Marvin.
He actually lives right there.

25:02.450 --> 25:06.235
He's really cool.
He's been, uh, helping me out.

25:06.237 --> 25:08.153
So, what's up with Cesar?

25:08.155 --> 25:10.205
Is he some kind of enforcer?

25:10.207 --> 25:12.074
Uh, I guess so.

25:12.076 --> 25:15.294
He apparently is
a little psycho, but I--

25:15.296 --> 25:17.246
Oh, hey, Marvin.
Here you are.

25:17.248 --> 25:18.797
I was wondering
where you were.

25:18.799 --> 25:20.249
Who's your friend?

25:20.251 --> 25:22.468
Oh, uh, this is Sarah.
She's new down here.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.286
I'm just here until
I can get

25:24.288 --> 25:26.672
a bus ticket back home
to Minnesota.

25:26.674 --> 25:28.640
You're rather put together

25:28.642 --> 25:32.344
for a girl who needs a bus ticket
back home to Minnesota.

25:32.346 --> 25:34.730
I was staying
at a friend's apartment,

25:34.732 --> 25:36.732
but then I got kicked out.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.734
Well, that is unfortunate.

25:38.736 --> 25:40.302
Here, this is for you.

25:40.304 --> 25:42.488
I found it
in a used bookstore.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.990
Wow. This is fantastic.
Thanks, man.

25:44.992 --> 25:47.326
Marvin, he's a magician.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.111
Show her something.

25:49.113 --> 25:52.998
Well, let me think.
Um...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.084
If I may.

25:55.086 --> 25:58.120
I could hypnotize her,

25:58.122 --> 26:02.324
but part of successful hypnosis
is knowing who's susceptible.

26:02.326 --> 26:05.160
People who can shut out reality.

26:05.162 --> 26:08.663
Who get sidetracked
by a sunset.

26:08.665 --> 26:12.351
Who lose track of time,
are good candidates.

26:12.353 --> 26:16.055
Those who aren't
tend to be judgmental,

26:16.057 --> 26:18.006
fastidious, and...

26:18.008 --> 26:20.559
Less trusting of others.

26:20.561 --> 26:22.945
Which I think describes Sarah.

26:22.947 --> 26:25.564
So perhaps I'll just

26:25.566 --> 26:28.367
lift her watch instead.

26:33.957 --> 26:35.335
There are at least
1,500 people

26:35.360 --> 26:37.193
 who live in
the flood control tunnels.

26:37.194 --> 26:38.727
It's a crossroads
of the destitute--

26:38.729 --> 26:40.863
ex-cons, drug addicts,
hard-core gamblers.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.798
Plus there's always the threat
that the tunnels will flood

26:42.800 --> 26:45.000
like they did last week when there
was a flash thunderstorm in the desert.

26:45.002 --> 26:46.835
We try to warn the
residents to evacuate,

26:46.837 --> 26:48.053
but there isn't
always time.

26:48.055 --> 26:49.421
Some of the tunnels
will flood

26:49.423 --> 26:51.557
when there's just a 15-minute storm
up in the mountains.

26:51.559 --> 26:54.009
So if the unsub knew
about a coming storm,

26:54.011 --> 26:55.394
he could have just
tied up the victims

26:55.396 --> 26:57.045
and left them in the tunnel
to drown.

26:57.047 --> 27:00.215
Then afterwards he just took
the bodies to the desert to dump them.

27:00.217 --> 27:03.318
With the third victim,
it hadn't rained in the last 24 hours,

27:03.320 --> 27:04.987
so he had to
just strangle them.

27:04.989 --> 27:07.106
Frida Bancroft
was a former drug addict.

27:07.108 --> 27:09.191
Renee and Elijah
were both strip-miners.

27:09.193 --> 27:11.860
It's more than likely
they were all residents underground.

27:11.862 --> 27:13.728
So we need to start
searching these tunnels.

27:13.730 --> 27:17.866
That's the tricky part.
There are 413 miles of them.

27:17.868 --> 27:20.702
It's unbelievable.
It's gonna make a great story.

27:20.704 --> 27:23.672
Ok. I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

27:23.674 --> 27:24.957
You going somewhere?

27:24.959 --> 27:27.543
Oh! You scared
the bejesus out of me.

27:27.545 --> 27:30.596
I was just heading out
to go get some things

27:30.598 --> 27:32.914
I left at the bus station
in a locker.

27:32.916 --> 27:34.850
Anything I can do to help?

27:34.852 --> 27:36.418
No, I'm good. Thanks.

27:36.420 --> 27:39.221
You've all been
very nice.

27:39.223 --> 27:40.422
All right, then.

27:40.424 --> 27:41.923
Have a good night.

27:41.925 --> 27:45.093
You, too.

27:57.018 --> 27:59.050
Based on where the victims
were last seen alive,

27:59.051 --> 28:00.885
plus the most accessible
locations in the tunnels,

28:00.887 --> 28:02.553
I've narrowed down the two
most likely sections

28:02.555 --> 28:03.971
they stayed in.
They're 22 miles apart.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.873
Ramirez: Just got a call
about a missing person.

28:05.875 --> 28:09.510
A journalist for the "Las Vegas Chronicle"
by the name of Sarah Renfield.

28:09.512 --> 28:11.178
Do you think this is
connected to our case?

28:11.180 --> 28:13.213
She's been working on a story about
the homeless people in the tunnels.

28:13.215 --> 28:15.182
Has anyone tried tracking
her cell phone?

28:15.184 --> 28:17.485
It was found in a dumpster on
Beakman Street on the south side of town.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.654
That's right here.
Nearest tunnel access point is C-16.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.072
That's 30 miles
from our other locations.

28:22.074 --> 28:23.390
All right,
we should split up.

28:23.392 --> 28:24.525
[Cell phone rings]

28:24.527 --> 28:26.410
Rossi: What'd you find,
Garcia?

28:26.412 --> 28:28.245
Could someone let the Pope
know about me,

28:28.247 --> 28:30.898
because what I do
is kind of a miracle.

28:30.900 --> 28:34.585
I recovered a text from
Renee Sheffield's cell phone

28:34.587 --> 28:37.755
sent 6 months ago before
her service was cut off.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.441
It reads, "Met E in tunnel.
Great guy.

28:40.443 --> 28:41.959
Planning to leave
together soon."

28:41.961 --> 28:44.678
Any chance "E" stands
for Elijah Hall?

28:44.680 --> 28:46.130
In my limited research
about the tunnels,

28:46.132 --> 28:48.749
it appears that people
meet and fall in love there.

28:48.751 --> 28:50.634
I've heard about entire
families that live down there.

28:50.636 --> 28:52.803
So in addition of being
accused of stealing,

28:52.805 --> 28:55.556
it seems all 3 victims wanted
to move out of the tunnels.

28:55.558 --> 28:57.608
Well, Frida the waitress
had just left.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.310
If Renee and Elijah were
about to do the same,

28:59.312 --> 29:02.313
that could have tr
the unsub's rage.

29:02.315 --> 29:03.948
You can't have a cult
if everyone tries to leave.

29:03.950 --> 29:07.001
Who knew living in the tunnels
came at such a high price?

29:11.239 --> 29:13.440
Hey, uh,
have you seen Sarah,

29:13.442 --> 29:16.310
the, uh, the new girl?

29:17.796 --> 29:19.964
Ok, thanks.

29:29.457 --> 29:32.125
Sarah!

29:32.127 --> 29:33.928
Sarah?

29:33.930 --> 29:35.095
Sarah!

29:37.465 --> 29:41.318
Hey. Um, I was looking
for Sarah, and I--

29:42.237 --> 29:43.771
Oh, my God!

29:43.773 --> 29:44.855
Oh, my God!

29:44.857 --> 29:47.241
What happened to her?

29:47.243 --> 29:49.643
She's a reporter.
She was gonna write about us,

29:49.645 --> 29:52.112
which would not be
a good thing.

29:52.114 --> 29:53.330
So you killed her?!

29:53.332 --> 29:54.448
She's not dead.

29:54.450 --> 29:55.799
Yet.

29:58.837 --> 30:00.287
Back away!

30:00.289 --> 30:02.039
Hey, what's going on?

30:02.041 --> 30:03.173
He's crazy, man.
She's a reporter.

30:03.175 --> 30:04.658
He hurt Sarah.
The water's over the bridge!

30:04.660 --> 30:06.794
What does that even mean?!
The Doctor knows!

30:06.796 --> 30:08.495
Can we all just calm down?

30:08.497 --> 30:10.514
Everyone wants
to do what's best.

30:10.516 --> 30:12.666
Since Finn vouched for her,

30:12.668 --> 30:17.037
perhaps he should be the one
to handle this.

30:20.225 --> 30:22.009
Hotch, over radio:
We're at a locked entrance.

30:22.011 --> 30:23.694
No one's been here
in a long time.

30:23.696 --> 30:26.179
Rossi: Copy that.

30:26.181 --> 30:29.016
Ohh. Remind me
to call my shoemaker.

30:29.018 --> 30:30.684
I'm gonna need
a new pair of boots.

30:30.686 --> 30:32.686
You have a shoemaker?

30:32.688 --> 30:34.855
Well, one thing
I've learned in life--

30:34.857 --> 30:38.375
a good pair of shoes
can last longer than a marriage.

30:38.377 --> 30:41.145
You only have to pay
for them once.

30:58.713 --> 31:02.182
Sir, we're with the FBI.

31:04.235 --> 31:06.320
We're looking for information
on these people.

31:06.322 --> 31:09.740
Do you recognize
any of them?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.358
No, I don't.

31:14.395 --> 31:16.697
Are you afraid of something?

31:17.666 --> 31:19.867
Whoever it is,
we'll protect you.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.743
Cesar's a very bad man.

31:29.745 --> 31:31.845
Where can we find him?

31:41.606 --> 31:45.059
JJ: FBI! We just want to talk.

31:45.061 --> 31:47.444
[Gunshots]

31:47.446 --> 31:50.263
Go! Go, go, go!

31:52.567 --> 31:55.102
JJ, go left.

32:17.809 --> 32:19.760
Drop it!

32:19.762 --> 32:21.478
Keep your hands
where I can see them

32:21.480 --> 32:23.981
and get down
on your knees.

32:39.255 --> 32:43.124
Where is Sarah?

32:43.126 --> 32:45.894
The police are still looking,
but there's no sign of her.

32:45.896 --> 32:49.064
Cesar, we have a witness

32:49.066 --> 32:51.933
who says you killed
these people.

32:51.935 --> 32:54.569
Did you murder Sarah, too?

32:54.571 --> 32:58.440
The water's over the bridge.

32:58.442 --> 33:00.475
What does that mean?

33:00.477 --> 33:02.494
The Doctor knows.

33:02.496 --> 33:04.913
Is that someone who lives
in the tunnels, too?

33:04.915 --> 33:08.833
He's more than someone.
Dr. Aja Mesbi is a magic man.

33:08.835 --> 33:11.036
Magic man?

33:11.038 --> 33:14.022
Yeah, he's like a sorcerer.

33:15.824 --> 33:18.659
He's got powers.

33:18.661 --> 33:21.662
What sort of powers?

33:21.664 --> 33:23.331
He controls words,

33:23.333 --> 33:25.934
thoughts.

33:25.936 --> 33:27.852
He can do whatever--

33:30.523 --> 33:34.693
he can do whatever he wants
in you just by thinking it.

33:34.695 --> 33:38.530
If he's not delusional
and this is an act, he's quite good.

33:38.532 --> 33:41.466
The water is over the bridge.

33:41.468 --> 33:45.153
It could be the opposite
of water under the bridge.

33:45.155 --> 33:46.571
It would mean something's
not forgiven,

33:46.573 --> 33:49.324
which is consistent
with revenge as a motive.

33:49.326 --> 33:51.159
[Cell phone rings] The drowning of
the first two victims

33:51.161 --> 33:53.361
could be symbolic of that.
Go ahead, Garcia.

33:53.363 --> 33:55.580
Coming at you with the skinny
on Cesar Jones.

33:55.582 --> 33:59.050
He's an ex-con who served time
8 years ago for armed robbery.

33:59.052 --> 34:00.719
According to prison
incident reports,

34:00.721 --> 34:03.638
he is known for his volatile
temper and extreme brutality.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.090
Any history
of mental illness?

34:05.092 --> 34:07.509
Any psychotic
or delusional disorders?

34:07.511 --> 34:10.061
I am not finding it.
I think he's just an angry person.

34:10.063 --> 34:11.596
Ok. Thanks.

34:11.598 --> 34:14.315
I don't think Cesar could have
pulled off all these murders

34:14.317 --> 34:15.934
or the kidnapping
of the reporter.

34:15.936 --> 34:19.020
It would take patience,
planning, and organization.

34:19.022 --> 34:21.356
He doesn't have
the concentration skill set.

34:21.358 --> 34:25.159
"Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain."

34:25.161 --> 34:26.828
"The Wizard of Oz"?

34:26.830 --> 34:29.414
The Doctor could be real.

34:29.416 --> 34:32.534
Cesar would be
the kind of person

34:32.536 --> 34:34.735
vulnerable to manipulation.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.205
And Dr. Aja Mesbi--

34:37.206 --> 34:38.739
[mouthing silently]
That's an odd name.

34:38.741 --> 34:42.260
It sounds vaguely
African or Indian.

34:42.262 --> 34:43.261
Or made up.

34:43.263 --> 34:45.213
It's an anagram,

34:45.215 --> 34:46.681
for James Braid.

34:46.683 --> 34:49.016
He was a Scottish
surgeon in the 1800s,

34:49.018 --> 34:51.436
considered to be
the father of hypnosis.

34:51.438 --> 34:53.036
Let me try something.

34:53.039 --> 34:54.522
Cesar's a lunatic.

34:54.524 --> 34:56.474
I'm pretty sure
he killed Frida

34:56.476 --> 34:59.110
and some other people,
too.

34:59.112 --> 35:00.195
Where are we?

35:00.197 --> 35:02.096
Above ground,
like you wanted.

35:02.098 --> 35:04.432
Yeah, but we're in the
middle of the desert.

35:04.434 --> 35:06.267
We were supposed to
bring her to the hospital.

35:06.269 --> 35:09.437
It's easy to get lost
in the tunnels.

35:09.439 --> 35:10.789
Cesar, hi.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.624
My name is Dr. Spencer Reid,

35:12.626 --> 35:15.627
and I'm an FBI agent.

35:15.629 --> 35:19.780
But, really, I work
for Dr. Mesbi.

35:19.782 --> 35:21.666
He sent me here
to help you.

35:21.668 --> 35:24.619
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

35:24.621 --> 35:28.089
I'll turn the camera off.

35:30.125 --> 35:32.594
I think you know
the Doctor's very powerful,

35:32.596 --> 35:35.897
and you can imagine he has many people
in many places to help him.

35:35.899 --> 35:38.133
Do you believe that?

35:38.967 --> 35:41.853
Finn, I know you care
about this girl.

35:41.855 --> 35:44.522
You're smart and you're
able to think ahead,

35:44.524 --> 35:46.941
so you can imagine
what will happen

35:46.943 --> 35:50.028
when she wakes up,
tied up, with us here.

35:50.030 --> 35:51.479
She'll think we did it.

35:51.481 --> 35:52.831
No, no, we'll explain to her
how we rescued her--

35:52.833 --> 35:54.649
And she won't believe it.

35:54.651 --> 35:55.650
No one would.

35:55.652 --> 35:57.452
Play it out.

35:57.454 --> 35:58.653
I don't know, man.

35:58.655 --> 36:00.121
If she goes
to the police,

36:00.123 --> 36:02.590
all of us in the tunnels
will be arrested, including you.

36:02.592 --> 36:04.959
She will ruin
a very good thing

36:04.961 --> 36:06.327
for a lot of people.

36:06.329 --> 36:08.429
What am I supposed to do?

36:08.431 --> 36:10.348
You already know
the answer, Finn.

36:10.350 --> 36:12.684
She cannot live.

36:12.686 --> 36:15.436
You have to kill her.

36:18.340 --> 36:20.358
The Doctor values you,
Cesar.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.777
He trusts you,
and you know that.

36:22.779 --> 36:25.864
You're very important and we need
to get you out of here,

36:25.866 --> 36:28.015
but in order for me
to help you,

36:28.017 --> 36:30.851
I need to know about the last
conversation you had with the Doctor.

36:34.657 --> 36:36.374
I can't remember it.

36:36.376 --> 36:39.026
I'm going to help you
try to remember, ok?

36:39.028 --> 36:42.196
Do me a favor
and close your eyes.

36:44.300 --> 36:47.168
Imagine you're back
in the tunnels.

36:47.170 --> 36:51.339
It's chilly.
The air smells damp.

36:51.341 --> 36:53.591
Do you see anything?

36:53.593 --> 36:54.926
Don't do this.

36:54.928 --> 36:56.377
I see Elijah.

36:56.379 --> 36:58.930
He's begging for his life.

36:58.932 --> 37:02.734
I hear the Doctor
and I go to him.

37:02.736 --> 37:04.602
Doctor.

37:04.604 --> 37:06.654
Reid: What happens next?
He's--

37:06.656 --> 37:08.055
I'll kill him now.

37:16.081 --> 37:17.749
The reporter's still alive.

37:17.751 --> 37:19.751
The Doctor's real name
is Marvin Caul.

37:19.753 --> 37:21.336
He and someone named
Finn Bailey

37:21.338 --> 37:23.204
took her into one of the tunnels
heading into the desert.

37:23.206 --> 37:24.756
How'd you get him
to talk?

37:24.758 --> 37:26.591
Neuro-linguistic programming.
I used sensory predicates

37:26.593 --> 37:28.242
and key words to tap into
his unconscious mind.

37:28.244 --> 37:30.295
Marvin Caul must have done
the exact same thing.

37:30.297 --> 37:31.763
You've lost me.

37:31.765 --> 37:34.215
NLP is a way of thinking
and communicating

37:34.217 --> 37:35.750
based on linguistic
modeling.

37:35.752 --> 37:37.468
For example, key words
like know and imagine

37:37.470 --> 37:38.919
open someone up
to suggestion.

37:38.921 --> 37:41.439
It's behind a lot of
persuasion and sales techniques.

37:41.441 --> 37:43.424
There are two different
exits into the desert.

37:43.426 --> 37:45.109
One on the north end
and the other's on the west.

37:45.111 --> 37:46.894
All right, let's go.

37:46.896 --> 37:48.279
What have you got,
Garcia?

37:48.281 --> 37:50.949
Marvin Caul, known as
the master of deception.

37:50.951 --> 37:54.068
He's a low-level entertainer
who performs at private parties.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.321
He hasn't filed a tax return
in 5 years.

37:56.323 --> 37:57.789
The IRS is after him.

37:57.791 --> 38:00.274
No known address.
He does have a P.O. Box.

38:00.276 --> 38:01.743
No tax returns?

38:01.745 --> 38:03.828
He's either not doing so well

38:03.830 --> 38:05.163
or doing really well.

38:05.165 --> 38:06.447
I'd guess the former.

38:06.449 --> 38:08.082
Someone who feels trivial
in the regular world

38:08.084 --> 38:09.751
would look for power
elsewhere.

38:09.753 --> 38:11.386
Well, the homeless would be
an easy population

38:11.388 --> 38:13.921
for him to exploit and give him
a sense of importance.

38:13.923 --> 38:16.123
What did you find out
about Finn Bailey?

38:16.125 --> 38:18.426
Finn Bailey, 26.
He was picked up in Reno

38:18.428 --> 38:19.978
two months ago
for shoplifting.

38:19.980 --> 38:22.981
According to the police reports,
he was on his way to Vegas

38:22.983 --> 38:24.666
to look for his sister Carrie.

38:24.668 --> 38:26.601
She was about to start a job
with a magician named Romeo,

38:26.603 --> 38:28.236
but the day before
she was supposed to start,

38:28.238 --> 38:32.156
she called her brother, sounding scared
and babbling about some doctor.

38:32.158 --> 38:33.524
That was the last
he heard from her.

38:33.526 --> 38:35.743
Did the Reno police
follow up?

38:35.745 --> 38:38.479
No, because there was no proof
that Carrie was actually missing.

38:38.481 --> 38:39.864
Well, we know Marvin's enraged
by people trying to leave.

38:39.866 --> 38:41.949
What if Carrie
was the original trigger?

38:41.951 --> 38:43.918
That means
she's probably dead.

38:46.655 --> 38:49.841
You know what
has to be done, Finn.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.836
Where did you get that?

39:01.838 --> 39:05.356
I stole it from the cab
of a semi last month.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.312
Before I do this,
I want to know something.

39:11.314 --> 39:13.564
The whole time
I was in the tunnel,

39:13.566 --> 39:18.453
you're the only one
that didn't seem scared of Cesar.

39:18.455 --> 39:20.738
And you were gone
on tax day.

39:23.859 --> 39:25.660
What's this about, Finn?

39:25.662 --> 39:27.745
My sister told me
all about you.

39:27.747 --> 39:29.831
How you liked to eat
at Della Rosa's grill,

39:29.833 --> 39:32.967
how you met her there and
brought her down to the tunnels.

39:32.969 --> 39:34.802
[Sirens]
You killed her, didn't you?!

39:34.804 --> 39:37.088
She said if anything
ever happened to her,

39:37.090 --> 39:38.373
the Doctor was responsible.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.174
You're the doctor, aren't you?

39:40.176 --> 39:41.726
FBI! Drop your weapon!

39:41.728 --> 39:43.845
Not until he tells me
what he did to my sister.

39:43.847 --> 39:45.980
You're mistaken, Finn.
I never met her.

39:45.982 --> 39:47.381
Liar!
Put the gun down!

39:47.383 --> 39:48.983
He told me to kill Sarah, too.

39:48.985 --> 39:50.217
The boy's quite mad.

39:50.219 --> 39:52.386
Finn, let us go to Sarah.

39:52.388 --> 39:55.356
She needs our help.
Will you let us do that?

40:05.584 --> 40:07.251
Copy that.

40:07.253 --> 40:10.955
The police just confirmed
your sister's dead, Finn. I'm sorry.

40:12.624 --> 40:14.459
Because you killed her.

40:14.461 --> 40:17.011
She was found in a crack den.
She died of an overdose.

40:17.013 --> 40:18.463
No, no, no.

40:18.465 --> 40:20.915
He convinced her to do it.
He's very persuasive.

40:20.917 --> 40:23.434
It was in Phoenix, Finn.
Is man had nothing to do with it.

40:23.436 --> 40:24.602
You have the wrong guy.

40:24.604 --> 40:25.853
Put the gun down.

40:25.855 --> 40:27.421
There's no point to this.

40:42.654 --> 40:45.773
[Sirens]

40:47.126 --> 40:48.776
Thank God you showed up.

40:48.778 --> 40:52.246
Marvin Caul, can I just
that say I'm a huge fan.

40:52.248 --> 40:54.966
I saw you perform
at the Lotus Inn back in 1977

40:54.968 --> 40:57.718
when I was a little kid and I always
wondered what happened to you.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.886
Time.

40:58.888 --> 41:00.955
Time has not been kind.

41:00.957 --> 41:02.974
Here, let me give you
a ride back to the station.

41:02.976 --> 41:04.475
Oh.

41:04.477 --> 41:06.627
I can't imagine
how hard it must have been

41:06.629 --> 41:09.430
for someone of your talent
to stay hidden for so long.

41:09.432 --> 41:11.399
I mean, weren't you dying
to get back out there?

41:11.401 --> 41:13.734
Of course.
And I have a plan.

41:13.736 --> 41:17.071
I am going to book a stage
at the Rio.

41:17.073 --> 41:19.023
So, that's what
the money was for.

41:19.025 --> 41:21.275
You know, I have to say,
it's absolutely brilliant.

41:21.277 --> 41:23.578
You found the perfect
population to steal from

41:23.580 --> 41:25.997
and someone else
to do your dirty work.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.982
I tip my hat to you.

41:27.984 --> 41:30.751
I have no idea
what you're saying.

41:30.753 --> 41:32.453
What I'm saying is that you're
going to be charged with murder,

41:32.455 --> 41:33.988
and the first one
will be Carrie's.

41:33.990 --> 41:36.156
I'm assuming you killed her
because your ego got in the way

41:36.158 --> 41:39.660
when she left you to work
for another magician. Am I right?

41:39.662 --> 41:41.095
Look, Marvin,
there's no place to go.

41:41.097 --> 41:44.765
You're a very clever man and you
know how to read a situation.

41:44.767 --> 41:47.018
Tell me where Carrie's body is
and at least you'll get recognition

41:47.020 --> 41:49.169
for what you accomplished
in the tunnels.

41:54.309 --> 41:58.846
She's buried at the abandoned
construction site.

42:00.181 --> 42:03.651
Did you really see me
at the Lotus Inn?

42:03.653 --> 42:04.635
The truth?

42:04.637 --> 42:06.954
I can't abide lies.

42:06.956 --> 42:08.990
I wasn't even born yet.

42:11.693 --> 42:15.746
Rossi: "Illusion is needed to disguise
the emptiness within."

42:15.748 --> 42:17.476
Arthur Erickson.

42:17.477 --> 42:19.260
I'm sorry you didn't
get to see your mom.

42:19.262 --> 42:20.430
It's ok. I guess now I know

42:20.455 --> 42:22.375
what a parent feels like
when their kid grows up.

42:22.648 --> 42:24.648
Someone who's depended
on you for so long

42:24.650 --> 42:26.317
and then suddenly they're off
living their own life

42:26.319 --> 42:28.051
and they don't really
need you anymore.

42:28.053 --> 42:31.405
Except she's the parent,
and that's how it should be.

42:31.407 --> 42:32.857
Oh, hi. Welcome back.

42:32.859 --> 42:34.191
This came for you.

42:34.193 --> 42:35.559
No return address?

42:35.561 --> 42:37.194
Yeah, and it's really heavy.
So what's inside it?

42:37.196 --> 42:39.029
Yes, that's me being nosy.

42:42.734 --> 42:44.335
That looks like
a pile of--

42:44.337 --> 42:46.403
shale, limestone,
and sandstone.

42:46.405 --> 42:48.071
It's a sculpture of the Grand Canyon
from my mom.

42:48.073 --> 42:50.191
See? She didn't forget you.

42:52.461 --> 42:54.678
She said she was gonna
mail the postcards,

42:54.680 --> 42:57.515
but then she decided to send
the Grand Canyon instead.

42:57.517 --> 42:58.682
Here, listen to this.

42:58.684 --> 43:00.818
"You many have to commit me
twice, Spencer,

43:00.820 --> 43:04.455
"because not only
did I ride a mule on a tiny trail

43:04.457 --> 43:06.190
"with a 1,000-foot
vertical drop,

43:06.192 --> 43:07.808
"I paid for the privilege.

43:07.810 --> 43:09.443
Now, that's crazy."

43:09.445 --> 43:10.811
Can you imagine my mom
on a mule?

43:10.813 --> 43:11.779
No.

43:11.781 --> 43:13.314
It's like Hotch
at the beach.

43:13.316 --> 43:15.749
"The mules must do this
all the time, because the seem very..."
