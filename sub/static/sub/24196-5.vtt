WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.292
Here it comes, Mr. Des Voeux.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.307
Hold for the calculation.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.229
1,014 feet per second, sir.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.567
Mark atmospheric pressure
at 30.191 inches.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.907
Temperature, minus 52.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.990
Is that the last one, sir?
My foot's gone horny now.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.876
Stamp it out.
We've got two more.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.826
The Terrors are aboard, sir.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.460
Good morning, Captain.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.427
Are we to have
a command meeting

01:36.513 --> 01:38.345
without our commander again?

01:40.183 --> 01:42.425
Captain Crozier
sends his regrets.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.475
We were able to bring
all the Terror stores you requested.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.603
Mr. Hornby's overseeing
the transfer below.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.026
Is there something
you're not telling me, Edward?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.274
Much to do on <i>Te r r o r</i> is all, sir.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.738
Well, then I will keep
this short. Um...

02:04.708 --> 02:07.746
Dundy can brief you on how
the combined men are faring,

02:07.836 --> 02:11.250
and I will get Mr. Reid
to brief you directly

02:11.340 --> 02:12.922
concerning the ice.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.587
The girl.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.506
You will take her back with you
today when you go.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.136
Sir, have you considered that
on <i>Te r r o r</i> are the very men...

02:26.229 --> 02:27.720
That is Francis's problem now.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.727
I no longer accept to host
that girl aboard my ship.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.975
The men here
are becoming upset by her.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.979
Upset, sir?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.443
You'll see.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.342
A-and finally, uh, foot.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.839
Feet.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.230
Yes. Yes.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.983
Bravo.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.781
Fitzjames orders them removed
every morning.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.954
Promises punishment
for leaving them.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.116
Well, I've orders
to pack her up.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.578
She's <i>Terror</i>'s problem now.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.458
Did I... did I hear correctly, Lieutenant?

03:38.969 --> 03:41.052
Y-You're taking her?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.754
May I come also?

03:42.848 --> 03:45.465
I-I'm working out
a dictionary of Inuktitut

03:45.559 --> 03:48.051
and she's talking, finally,

03:48.145 --> 03:49.261
and at speed.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.437
Has she spoken any more
of the creature?

03:52.649 --> 03:55.562
Not as yet,
that I can discern, but...

03:58.697 --> 04:00.438
I feel we're close.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.319
You understand
<i>Terror</i>'s situation?

04:02.826 --> 04:03.987
I do.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.285
Get leave, then. And pack well.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.785
If the weather deteriorates further,
you may be with us a while.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.345
<i>Te r r o r?</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:03.301
Captain Fitzjames says he's
happy to be relieved of a man,

05:03.386 --> 05:04.968
given our numbers now.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.217
May as well write
a Newfie dictionary.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.468
Or Capuchin.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.140
- Dr.
- Hold it.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.345
Why are you asking me, Mr. Goodsir?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.556
You've already spoken
to the Captain.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.270
And packed, I see.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.190
Doctor, I'm to tell you
we're going up the ladder now.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.409
Captain's leaving
the decision to you,

05:29.496 --> 05:30.987
in case I'd be too missed.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.494
I really wouldn't
worry yourself there.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.669
Fine. Go with the girl.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.507
And don't forget to invite us
all to the wedding.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.588
Has anyone ever invited you
to a wedding, Dr. Stanley?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.763
Is he always that cheeky?

05:58.275 --> 05:59.766
No.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.520
That's something new.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.114
...are to be used, Mr. Crossham.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.947
Attend to that reading
every week, without fail.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.917
Name?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.711
William Wentzell, sir.
From <i>Te rr o r.</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:23.164
Your nails are a terror,
Mr. Wentzell.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.920
You are far from
excused for this.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.627
Mark down three days duty owing...
one for that collar.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.712
Men!

06:31.349 --> 06:33.557
I would wager you've never had
more time than this

06:33.643 --> 06:35.259
to keep yourselves neat!

06:35.645 --> 06:38.228
I also understand,
given our numbers,

06:38.315 --> 06:40.773
you have likely never had
less time at the basin.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.975
Even so,

06:42.068 --> 06:44.481
nine of you earned duty
in the log today.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.737
That must improve.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.946
Next week, that number will be zero.
Is that understood?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.277
Aye, sir!

06:53.622 --> 06:56.114
- Good.
- Carry on, men!

06:56.207 --> 06:57.869
- Mr. Collins?
- Sir.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.451
- It's about the <i>Te r ro r</i> party.
- Why? What's happened?

07:00.545 --> 07:03.629
You told me to report anything
like this if it happened,

07:03.715 --> 07:05.752
and it has.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.296
Lieutenant Little came today

07:08.386 --> 07:11.254
with a requisition
signed by Captain Crozier.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.089
For the spirit room.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.970
And what did he take?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.642
Sixteen bottles, sir.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.389
- Thank you, Mr. Collins.
- Sir.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.896
Mr. Hornby!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.607
Mr. Hornby?

08:15.912 --> 08:18.325
Fetch that up
before it hardens, Mr. Hickey!

08:19.249 --> 08:21.491
As you can see,
I'm shooting into the brown tonight.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.453
Climb down.
We'll lower him behind you.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.842
Mr. Hornby collapsed on the ice.
He's gone.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.385
We've got Lady Silence with us.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.839
Take her down
to the slop storage.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.720
Will she be safe?
Will someone be with her?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.893
She will be fine
with Lieutenant Hodgson.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.066
Bring him down. Easy.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.418
- What happened to Mr. Hornby?
- We don't know.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.672
You shouldn't carry heavy things
until your wounds mend, Mr. Hickey.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.675
You'll be fighting down
worse than pain.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.597
I'm sure Dr. MacDonald's
told you this.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.299
Yes.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.056
Mr. Darlington and I
were just discussing that.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.854
Excuse me.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.826
With the weight in the ship
having shifted from the central axis...

09:48.588 --> 09:49.999
Ah, Edward.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.048
How fares
the Raft of the Medusa?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.760
Mr. Hornby collapsed on the ice
on the trek back.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.090
Dr. MacDonald thinks
his heart stopped.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.096
Hornby's dead?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.303
He is.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.935
They're preparing him now
to take him down to the hold

10:09.025 --> 10:11.108
with the others.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.571
He was a good mate. Steady.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.489
Light on his feet.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.452
I'm sorry to mix things, sir,

10:21.538 --> 10:24.622
but we've also brought back
the Lady Silence with us.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.450
I tried to remind
Captain Fitzjames who's aboard,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.410
but he insisted.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.000
Mr. Goodsir came along as well.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.546
Apparently he's making some
progress with what you asked.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.631
Very good.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.134
Once she's settled
and has eaten,

10:41.224 --> 10:43.136
collect her and Mr. Goodsir.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.013
I'll have them in for tea.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.686
We have a round
of catch-up to do.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.013
Thomas, would you mind?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.985
Check the crossbeams and let me
know if you find any weeping.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.028
- Ready the...
- Francis, in this bloody cold,

10:57.115 --> 10:59.653
no-one should be out there
for more than half an hour.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.324
You're right.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.403
We'll hold a service for him
tomorrow.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.822
Ready the spare masts
to be taken up.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.373
We'll see
what the ice wants next,

11:08.459 --> 11:10.576
then finalize a buttress plan
in the morning.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.706
Aye.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.846
No whiskey in <i>Er e b u s</i> 's
spirit room, sir.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.800
Only gin. Rum and gin.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.223
Damn it!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.058
Jopson!

11:32.734 --> 11:34.350
My father drank gin.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.107
I'm not sure Mr. Collins is going to be
as discreet as we'd hoped.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.858
Right, here's what you do.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.910
You go back, and this time
you tell Mr. Collins

11:44.996 --> 11:46.828
to get it from James's
personal store.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.706
He's had enough of mine
over the years.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.294
Put a bullet in my head
before I drink gin.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.668
Ah, Jopson.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.629
Mr. Hornby's dead.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.880
Um...

12:00.970 --> 12:04.304
As Mr. Helpman is on <i>Er e b u s,</i>
would you be so kind

12:04.390 --> 12:06.382
as to collect
Mr. Hornby's personal things

12:06.476 --> 12:08.684
and put them in store
for his family?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.845
Find out who his best mate was

12:10.939 --> 12:13.602
and give that man
Mr. Hornby's tobacco.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.603
- Consider it done, sir.
- Thank you.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.727
Um...

12:18.821 --> 12:22.030
Would you recall how much whiskey
is left in my stores?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.984
Two bottles, sir.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.950
- Bring them up.
- Yes, sir.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.458
That's your clock.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.833
See it doesn't run out.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.006
Yes, sir.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.173
You should be about through
with the salt now.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.599
You're mending nicely.

12:48.685 --> 12:52.224
Your kindness is unstoppable,
Mr. Goodsir.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.558
I mean that.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.021
There's no more generous man
on these ships.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.937
Was Lady Silence
brought on board

13:02.031 --> 13:04.023
to be questioned
by the Captain?

13:06.703 --> 13:09.116
Does that really work
with anyone, Mr. Hickey?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.003
Thank you for your help today.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.960
You have a busier sick bay
than I'd imagined,

13:25.054 --> 13:27.216
- with so few men aboard.
- It's the weather.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.639
I'm going to suggest
to the Captain

13:29.726 --> 13:32.013
that he cancels all trips
to and from <i>E r e b u s</i>

13:32.103 --> 13:33.389
until it breaks.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.186
I don't want to see
another of these boys

13:35.273 --> 13:37.640
lose a piece or a part.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.145
Hm.

13:39.235 --> 13:43.149
I've heard teeth can explode in...
in air this cold. Imagine.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.229
I don't have to.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.361
In '39, Captain Penny,

13:46.451 --> 13:48.909
our lead whaler's tooth
did just that.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.578
The root stays warm,
but the surface freezes like a...

13:52.749 --> 13:54.832
like a little bomb.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.749
While I'm here...

13:56.836 --> 14:00.750
have you any men aboard
suffering a line?

14:01.424 --> 14:02.756
On the gums.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.504
Like a line of ash,
in the tissue.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.587
No. Are there
any other symptoms?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.724
Headaches,
numbness, joint pain.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.892
Possibly dystrophy
of the memory.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.137
Something other than scurvy?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.812
I know you've started
to see cases.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.357
No, this is...
This is quite different.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.565
What comes first to your mind?

14:25.323 --> 14:27.440
I thought immediately
of bismuth.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.526
I trained on cadavers,

14:30.620 --> 14:32.407
some of whom were syphilitic.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.659
They had been treated
with bismuth for months.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.285
It had built up in their gums.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.993
The color's not the same,
but it's the same presentation.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.625
Is he indulgent with drink?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.377
He has not much access to it
beyond his evening grog. Why?

14:44.467 --> 14:49.132
I just remembered, years ago,
reading about a case in Devon

14:49.222 --> 14:52.806
where the cider presses were
causing a similar vexation.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.135
- The presses?
- Yes. They were made of lead.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.103
Our water tanks are lead.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.228
It doesn't affect
neutral liquids, fortunately.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.443
Handling the stuff
can be harmful.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.646
The French have proved it,

15:06.739 --> 15:09.823
and Charles Thackrah
has written about gout in plumbers.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.992
What's...
What's his job, your man?

15:12.537 --> 15:15.655
He's one of the mates.
He hasn't handled anything

15:15.748 --> 15:18.866
without gloves on deck for years,
I'd imagine.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.373
Well, I'll start making inquiries,
Mr. Goodsir.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.294
I've not seen this myself.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.916
I wish you'd call me Harry.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.798
Well, I... I might call you "Doctor."

15:32.181 --> 15:34.423
You're sounding
very like one to me just now.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.150
Cornelius.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.281
- Just a word, Billy.
- Hm?

15:56.205 --> 15:58.288
What?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.867
What do you want?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.628
To know what's preoccupying

16:05.715 --> 16:08.173
the officers' thoughts
these days.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.468
Who's unhappy? Why?

16:11.554 --> 16:14.046
How am I supposed to know
that any better than you?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.558
That magic line is how.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.475
See, I can't get my ears
over that line

16:22.565 --> 16:24.852
unless I'm caulking a privy.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.733
You serve every meal
of every day behind that line.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.814
You practically live
behind that line.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.491
What do I get in return?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.365
News of the marines?

16:37.455 --> 16:39.742
To the hold, Mr. Hickey.
You've got duty. Two minutes.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.198
Right away, sir.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.500
You can help put Mr. Hornby
in the Dead Room.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.669
Close your eyes.
Hold your hand out.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.291
- No.
- Relax.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.247
I'm not going to have
congress with it.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.416
Then will you let me alone?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.672
Close your eyes.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.567
Where did you get it?

17:13.324 --> 17:16.192
Someone
who didn't need it any more.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.873
Your ears, Billy.
Unbutton them.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.895
Magnus?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.910
What is it, Manson?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.571
I-I, um...

18:02.665 --> 18:05.282
- I-I can't go down, sir.
- Well, you fit, don't you?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.745
I mean, um...

18:09.839 --> 18:12.081
I don't like
to go down there now, sir.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.587
Well, down there
is the hold of the ship

18:14.677 --> 18:16.339
the Navy pays you to work in.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.513
Just... with Strong and Evans
already down there, I...

18:23.185 --> 18:25.177
It's just that I've heard them, sir.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.929
You've heard them?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.815
Are you a blasphemer?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.893
No. A lot of the men have, sir.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.149
Manson, just lower him down.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.650
I can get him on my shoulder.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.982
You look at me, Manson.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.783
What's left of Strong and Evans
is frozen solid,

18:43.873 --> 18:47.037
sewn into hammocks like this with
three layers of canvas wrapped around it.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.913
It's not them
trying to get out your hearing,

18:49.003 --> 18:51.495
- but rats trying to get in.
- Sir... Sir, please.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.174
I... I'm going to order you
down that ladder now.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.967
If you refuse,

18:58.054 --> 19:00.091
I will not recommend you
to be lashed again.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.306
I will recommend you be made to sit
in the Dead Room with your friends,

19:03.392 --> 19:05.179
with the door locked,
until you learn

19:05.269 --> 19:07.306
that God grants us
many things in this world,

19:07.396 --> 19:08.978
but he does not
grant us ghosts.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.141
- Sir, you wouldn't.
- Would you like to see?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.648
What you need is more light,
Mr. Manson.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.658
You go and fetch a lantern.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.658
And then you can keep
Mr. Hartnell and me safe

19:25.748 --> 19:27.455
on these rungs, yeah?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.459
Come on.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.259
Step.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.676
Just stack him on top.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.260
It's all right, Manson. He's stowed.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.103
They see the cannon flash
from the position camp,

20:32.189 --> 20:35.478
and then they mark how long
after it the sound arrives.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.686
The light will travel faster,
but less so the colder it is.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.522
Or something to that tune.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.781
It's a reason to shoot off
a six-pounder, anyway.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.330
You must hear it down here.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.877
Do you remember the old lad
on the Prince Regent

20:55.963 --> 20:58.171
the doxies used to call
"Six Pounder"?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.755
Where's he right now,
do you think?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.218
I'm ready to go up, Private.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.325
Quick as you can, boys.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.160
The men on the ice
have half a mile to march

21:37.254 --> 21:38.461
back to <i>Er e b u s</i> after.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.335
We'll not get temperatures much
lower this year, I'd wager.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.291
What about the creature, sir?

21:43.385 --> 21:45.377
If you can hear
the cannon fire so far...

21:46.430 --> 21:48.797
haven't we been calling it
right to us all day?

21:48.891 --> 21:50.757
Or scaring it off.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.467
I'm more afeared of the cold, boys.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.974
I play the clavier back home.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.896
And for that
you need every finger.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.521
Ah, Dr. Goodsir.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.526
Come in, please.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.776
Lieutenant Little has gone
to fetch our Lady now.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.664
Thank you for being our proxy
while she's been on <i>Er e b u s.</i>

22:15.125 --> 22:16.832
You're getting
quite expert, I hear.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.002
I didn't understand

22:19.088 --> 22:22.672
how to record her dialect
phonetically at first, but...

22:25.511 --> 22:28.424
but I've created
a system of notation

22:28.514 --> 22:29.880
for a dictionary I've begun...

22:29.974 --> 22:32.057
And the creature?

22:32.977 --> 22:34.184
I've tried,

22:34.270 --> 22:37.559
but on that subject
she doesn't offer to converse.

22:37.648 --> 22:42.188
I-I sense these matters are
quite private in her culture.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.070
She's berthed with you
a month now.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.198
About what have you conversed?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.488
Mm.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.286
The land, the ice.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.871
Her tools, her clothing.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.699
Our tools, our clothing.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.710
But I feel that we're close.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.254
I think we have to do this in her time.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.922
We shall try together.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.258
Please.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.484
Tea?

23:38.876 --> 23:40.708
Uh...

23:47.343 --> 23:49.756
Let's get to it, then.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.096
Tuunbaq.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.190
- Tu...
- Tuunbaq.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.188
Tuun... Tuunbaq.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.984
- Tuunbaq.
- Tuunbaq.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.068
Do you know the word,
Mr. Blanky?

24:15.955 --> 24:19.574
It's similar to a Yupik word
I know from Russian America.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.875
Tuunbaq. A spirit.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.546
- Spirit?
- That may not be her meaning.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.715
A spirit that dresses as an animal.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.001
That doesn't leave this room.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.465
Tuunbaq...

25:28.485 --> 25:30.397
- No, no, no.
- Maybe... maybe...

25:30.487 --> 25:32.069
maybe if I try.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.736
It's killed five men
on this expedition.

25:35.826 --> 25:36.907
- I understand.
- Ripped them apart.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.737
But she has been responding
to a lighter touch.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.911
How do we kill it?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.293
Go on.

26:00.350 --> 26:04.219
I hope you live to sell
your dictionary, Mr. Goodsir.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.056
I hope I live to buy it.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.083
Tuunbaq.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.045
Help us.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.304
Do we all agree
she's not co-operating?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.757
Sir, in the month
that she's been here,

26:42.851 --> 26:45.093
she hasn't once
mentioned leaving

26:45.187 --> 26:47.679
or made any attempt at escape.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.931
Ever ask yourself why?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.443
She's frightened of it, also.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.114
Maybe it's gone off somehow.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.487
Lieutenant Little, Lady Silence
is to be denied protection

27:00.577 --> 27:01.693
on either ship.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.994
- Sir...
- Surely...

27:03.080 --> 27:05.163
Thomas, escort her off <i>Te rr o r.</i>

27:05.249 --> 27:08.037
Let her back aboard only
if she's screaming for help.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.039
No, I will not, Francis.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.624
Help us stop it or you leave!

27:47.916 --> 27:50.078
She asked you,
"Why do you want to die?"

27:53.255 --> 27:55.998
Oh, God. Get off my ship.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.424
What in God's name
is happening here?

28:02.097 --> 28:04.714
- Francis...
- Don't ever call me Francis again.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.845
You'll call me
what I'm due to be called.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.723
You stole 16 bottles of spirits
from my ship.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.725
- I did no such thing!
- I don't know what you're due.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.307
I do know there hasn't been
a single meal we've shared,

28:14.401 --> 28:16.108
a single conversation,
when you weren't morbing on

28:16.195 --> 28:18.061
about what you're due.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.691
Your luck has changed, Francis.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.522
No-one has you
in harness any longer.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.109
You are commanding
this expedition entire.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.862
So damn your eyes.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.622
What else do you require?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.949
Respect?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.785
Well, earn it.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.212
Or are you determined to be
the worst kind of first as well?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.296
Francis!

28:42.012 --> 28:45.050
- Get off me!
- Sit down!

28:45.140 --> 28:47.427
You be careful now!
Or what happened

28:47.517 --> 28:50.601
to John Ross at Fury Beach
will happen to you.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.428
Everyone out.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.936
- Francis...
- Oh, go smoke a pipe, Thomas.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.393
Or better yet,
go stare at the ice.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.730
I want a full report
in an hour.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.280
That's an order.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.949
Thomas.

29:07.704 --> 29:08.990
Captain.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.835
We both know
what is happening with you.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.137
Mr. Blanky... what's happening?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.760
He's ill with it now.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.512
Fetch your coat and come up.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.783
Mr. Blanky! Mr. Blanky!

29:55.752 --> 29:58.290
Coming through!
It took Darlington!

29:58.380 --> 30:00.212
He's dead!

30:09.391 --> 30:11.599
Jammed!

30:11.685 --> 30:13.677
- The forward hatch...
- It's been sealed, sir.

30:13.770 --> 30:14.977
Just today.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.941
Over the gunwale!

30:23.739 --> 30:26.277
Lend a hand here!

30:28.827 --> 30:30.409
We can't see it!

30:34.082 --> 30:35.744
It's at the stern!

30:37.252 --> 30:38.993
- Thomas!
- We can't get down!

30:39.087 --> 30:40.669
It's at the stern.
It's coming up.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.505
It's at the stern!

31:10.243 --> 31:11.575
We've got no arms!

31:11.661 --> 31:14.404
Go to the bow and over
the side, onto the ice. Hide.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.989
Go. Go! Go on!

32:38.248 --> 32:40.991
Man the cannon!
The bloody cannon!

32:42.085 --> 32:43.792
He's calling for the cannon.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.041
We can carry it to the fife rail
and turn it forward.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.338
I need your help, lads.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.165
Alright. Come on.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.973
Put a bloody ball through it!

33:36.765 --> 33:39.849
- Hodgson!
- I'm readying the cannon!

33:54.115 --> 33:56.778
The creature's run Mr. Blanky
up the foremast!

33:56.868 --> 33:59.076
We've lost him up there!

34:04.042 --> 34:05.704
Hang on!

34:09.965 --> 34:11.376
Argh!

34:13.301 --> 34:14.792
I can't see a bloody thing!

34:27.190 --> 34:28.772
There!

34:30.150 --> 34:32.609
Tilt up! Tilt it up!

34:34.155 --> 34:35.396
Two inches!

34:35.489 --> 34:37.106
One more!

34:37.199 --> 34:38.782
First shot's a winner, lads.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.279
Fire!

34:44.916 --> 34:46.077
Yes!

34:48.168 --> 34:50.126
Leave it with us!

35:02.183 --> 35:03.674
It's run off, sir!

35:08.648 --> 35:10.480
Thank God.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.689
He's up there!

35:45.143 --> 35:47.055
He's frozen through.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.979
Gently!

35:51.941 --> 35:54.479
Can we have some light, please?

35:56.738 --> 35:58.400
Lieutenant Hodgson,
are you fine?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.651
I'm all right, yes.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.983
Find the key and get more rum.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.114
I'll give Mr. Blanky
some coca to soothe him,

36:04.204 --> 36:06.571
but we're going to have
to get him good and plastered as well.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.205
I'll go. I'll go.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.124
She run off after it.
Laid me right out.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.043
Whiskey.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.043
Here. Go on, drink up.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.629
No, Francis.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.551
Everyone gets a shot.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.302
I think I made a connection
tonight, me and it.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.230
I feel like we got engaged
and I want to celebrate.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.524
Ow!

37:22.657 --> 37:24.944
To us! Me and it.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.239
Excuse me.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.118
Ah, Mr. Jopson, if you would?

37:32.208 --> 37:33.824
Go on, knock it back.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.625
Go on, go on.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.920
Are you ready, Mr. Blanky?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.796
Arghh!

38:09.913 --> 38:12.872
Jopson,
I'd like you to join us.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.323
Sit down.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.830
Here, at the table.

38:24.552 --> 38:29.468
I'm afraid... I need to ask
the four of you for a favor

38:29.557 --> 38:32.846
that will likely be
a great imposition.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.184
And...

38:38.691 --> 38:41.559
There couldn't be worse timing,
I understand.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.396
But there also couldn't be
a greater need.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.493
I'm going to be unwell,
gentlemen.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.326
Quite unwell, I expect.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.661
And I don't know for how long.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.086
A week? No.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.384
Two.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.972
Perhaps... Perhaps more.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.514
And not only must you draw
the tightest possible curtain

39:19.607 --> 39:20.848
around what is happening,

39:20.942 --> 39:22.899
but you must also
care for me...

39:24.153 --> 39:25.564
...as well.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.398
As I will not be able
to care for myself.

39:30.410 --> 39:33.198
You needn't worry
for a thing, sir.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.910
I will be in no position
to command.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.548
That will be
for Captain Fitzjames...

39:45.633 --> 39:46.965
for all things.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.094
And you must be
my proxy here, Edward.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.048
- Francis...
- No.

39:54.517 --> 39:58.807
I'm sorry, but we mustn't stop
until it is finished.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.389
I mustn't stop,

40:02.483 --> 40:04.850
and you mustn't let me.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.279
I may... I may beg you.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.962
Take this out to the spot
where the thing's blood is

40:30.053 --> 40:31.794
and pour it out there.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.555
Here.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.138
Take this.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.768
Take it.

40:49.906 --> 40:53.320
Don't give it back to me
until you see me on deck again...

40:54.744 --> 40:56.861
in full uniform.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.297
I need your help, Jacko.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.898
It's not your little painted bowl,
I know, but...

42:08.943 --> 42:11.230
we can make do
until I find it.
