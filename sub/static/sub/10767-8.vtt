00:05.493 --> 00:07.324
Excuse me.

00:08.253 --> 00:11.165
Girl, I hope these Greek clowns
clean up after themselves.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.324
A bunch of messy,
inconsiderate children.

00:13.493 --> 00:15.165
So which house are you joining?

00:15.333 --> 00:17.324
Girl, you know I ain't
into that frat stuff.

00:17.493 --> 00:21.930
It's for a bunch of pocket-protector-
wearing, no-social-life-having losers.

00:22.733 --> 00:25.372
Let the pledging begin.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.563
The defense rests, Your Honor.

00:29.173 --> 00:31.323
Will thinks fraternities
are a waste of time.

00:31.493 --> 00:32.561
Maybe for him.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.884
But the more activities I'm involved in,
the better I look to Princeton.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.044
Besides, these guys
know how to have fun.

00:38.213 --> 00:41.649
<i>We're Delta Kappa Tau
We'd like to take a bow</i>

00:41.813 --> 00:44.327
<i>We got the highest grades
And we will tell you how</i>

00:44.493 --> 00:46.927
<i>We study, study, study
For professional careers</i>

00:47.093 --> 00:49.766
<i>We drink a lot of Ovaltine
But never any beers</i>

00:52.773 --> 00:55.241
<i>Revenge of the Nerds: Part Six.</i>

00:55.413 --> 01:00.965
<i>We're Lambda Kappa Nu
Our blood is very blue</i>

01:01.133 --> 01:03.886
<i>Our money's old
Our cards are gold</i>

01:04.053 --> 01:07.045
<i>And who the heck are you?</i>

01:07.733 --> 01:11.442
Where's, like, a big gong
when you need one, you know?

01:14.133 --> 01:17.364
Make way for the brothers
of Phi Beta Gamma.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.171
<i>Phi Beta Gamma step</i>

01:20.133 --> 01:21.327

01:21.493 --> 01:22.846

01:41.773 --> 01:46.244
Man! Hey, I guess
that's a tough choice, huh, Carlton?

01:46.413 --> 01:47.846
I'll say.

01:48.053 --> 01:50.487
Can I hear yours again?

02:59.653 --> 03:04.602
Well, my gold card has a hologram
of Lee lacocca on it.

03:05.613 --> 03:09.367
Excuse us, guys,
it's time for a Negro moment.

03:11.693 --> 03:13.923
Carlton, wouldn't you rather
join a fraternity...

03:14.093 --> 03:15.890
...where the guys look more like you?

03:16.053 --> 03:17.327
I was.

03:17.493 --> 03:20.644
Didn't you notice
we all had alligator shirts on?

03:22.093 --> 03:24.891
- What up, Philly boy.
- What's up, man?

03:25.053 --> 03:28.045
I haven't seen you at the courts lately.
I miss our one-on-one.

03:28.213 --> 03:30.568
Now, Top Dog,
you know when it's me against you...

03:30.733 --> 03:32.325
...it's one-on-none.

03:32.493 --> 03:35.212
I can't play on them tired courts
y'all be playing on, man.

03:35.373 --> 03:36.965
You haven't been there in a while.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.044
Me and my frat brothers,
we raised money...

03:39.213 --> 03:40.965
...and we hooked them
rims up proper.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.931
Are you in a fraternity?
And here I thought you had a life.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.049
Hey, man, I run the fraternity.

03:46.213 --> 03:47.851
Hey, why don't you check us out.

03:48.013 --> 03:50.481
Oh, no, man,
fraternities ain't my flavor.

03:51.653 --> 03:54.008
See you at the frat tonight.

03:56.853 --> 03:59.890
But, I will have
a double scoop of that, though.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.322
Hey, hey, hey.

04:01.493 --> 04:03.802
We also do a lot of work
for the community, brother.

04:03.973 --> 04:05.691
Like visit down at the senior center.

04:05.853 --> 04:08.083
And we also tutor kids
down at the juvenile hall.

04:08.253 --> 04:09.527
Oh, terrific.

04:09.693 --> 04:12.969
The Princeton people love to see
community service on applications.

04:13.133 --> 04:15.647
I wouldn't really have to go
to juvenile hall, would I?

04:15.813 --> 04:18.043
I hear those kids
are real troublemakers.

04:20.012 --> 04:22.322
We need a little humor
down at the frat house.

04:22.493 --> 04:25.565
Well, it don't get no littler
than cousin Carlton.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.088
What's up, Carlton? Top Dog.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.771
Think about it, Philly boy.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.207
You too, cousin.

04:35.373 --> 04:37.364
Us brothers need to stick together.

04:37.533 --> 04:38.682
Yes, sir.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.962
<i>Twenty-six years of marriage
and I find you in bed with a cheerleader.</i>

04:47.133 --> 04:49.772
<i>Lazlo, how could you?</i>

04:52.173 --> 04:56.610
<i>Tune in tomorrow
for another episode of All My Fault.</i>

04:58.213 --> 04:59.487
What a sleaze.

04:59.653 --> 05:02.167
I hope Mary dumps Lazlo's sorry butt.

05:02.333 --> 05:06.690
Me too. You think she would've learned
after he lied about neutering the cat.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.006
She really hasn't been the same
since she had that sex change.

05:10.173 --> 05:13.245
- Yeah, I guess you're right about that.
- Listen to yourselves.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.052
You're caught up in the lives
of make-believe characters.

05:16.213 --> 05:18.329
I'll tell you what, Mom,
I'll watch the baby...

05:18.493 --> 05:21.405
...go to a museum
and take Hilary with you.

05:21.813 --> 05:24.725
Ashley, the only reason
we get involved in this kind of stuff...

05:24.893 --> 05:28.010
...is that real life sometimes
is kind of boring.

05:33.173 --> 05:36.643
- What's that?
- Harley-Davidson '58 panhead.

05:39.693 --> 05:41.809
I used to date a biker.

05:45.173 --> 05:48.529
- Was that a ride or was that a ride?
- Great.

05:48.693 --> 05:51.730
Maybe next time
we can actually hit second gear.

05:53.533 --> 05:56.684
- Philip, what's going on?
- What's it look like, Vivian?

05:56.853 --> 06:00.163
Looks like a bunch of middle-aged men
with too much time on their hands.

06:00.333 --> 06:03.291
Hey, we're bikers.

06:03.453 --> 06:06.013
Dan, you're an accountant.

06:07.373 --> 06:10.365
Got a moment, Fonzie?

06:17.213 --> 06:18.282
Are you crazy?

06:18.453 --> 06:21.092
I told you I was gonna
buy a bike someday, Vivian.

06:21.253 --> 06:24.051
Well, you also told me
you were gonna lose 50 pounds.

06:24.733 --> 06:26.610
A motorbike is so dangerous.

06:26.773 --> 06:28.206
Well, just look at it this way.

06:28.373 --> 06:31.445
If I take a fall,
I have a 50-pound cushion.

06:34.053 --> 06:39.127
Honey, you've also got an infant son
who needs you in one piece.

06:39.293 --> 06:41.966
I don't see Dan's wife
giving him any heat over this.

06:42.613 --> 06:43.887
From what Helen tells me...

06:44.053 --> 06:47.090
...she ain't giving him any heat
anywhere else either.

06:47.293 --> 06:50.524
Oh, you women discuss that?

06:51.373 --> 06:53.682
You'd be surprised what we talk about.

06:53.853 --> 06:55.684
Honey, be reasonable.

06:55.853 --> 06:58.811
Get off the midlife-crisis highway
and come home.

06:58.973 --> 07:02.249
Oh, yeah, I can't wait
to see your first hot flash.

07:05.813 --> 07:09.692
- Uncle Phil, what's up with the bike?
- Look, I bought me a motorcycle.

07:09.853 --> 07:13.129
It was my decision, and
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.048
Must be that midlife crisis thing
Aunt Viv warned us about.

07:18.253 --> 07:21.689
- So how are things at school?
- Great.

07:21.853 --> 07:24.367
Dad, I'm thinking of pledging
Phi Beta Gamma.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.684
- Judge Morton is a Gamma.
- He's also an alcoholic.

07:28.733 --> 07:31.088
No, that's Judge Martin.

07:32.293 --> 07:35.808
So that's great, son.
You're a real college man now, huh?

07:35.973 --> 07:39.682
Thanks, Dad.
Well, I think I'm gonna go take my nap.

07:43.733 --> 07:46.805
So I take it you're not pledging?

07:46.973 --> 07:50.932
Oh, no. You know, Uncle Phil,
I got a reputation more as a free spirit.

07:51.093 --> 07:55.211
Will, I wouldn't sell fraternity life short.
You might get something out of it.

07:55.373 --> 07:58.012
True. They do a lot of work
in the community and stuff.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.606
The Gammas are a good group.

07:59.773 --> 08:01.570
Why don't you give it a shot.

08:01.733 --> 08:04.327
The frat leader does need
a little help with his jumping.

08:04.493 --> 08:06.643
Maybe I'll join as, like, a mercy thing.

08:06.813 --> 08:07.848
That's good.

08:08.013 --> 08:11.005
- So hop on, I'll take you for a ride.
- Oh, that's cool.

08:12.813 --> 08:16.931
Oh, but you better not try
none of that run-out-of-gas stuff, mister.

08:22.493 --> 08:23.926
Pledges...

08:24.533 --> 08:28.526
...on behalf of the brothers
of Phi Beta Gamma, I welcome you.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.811
The journey begins.

08:30.973 --> 08:33.611
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just relax, Magellan.

08:33.773 --> 08:37.208
All right, at this time, I'd like to turn it
over to big Brother Top Dog.

08:37.373 --> 08:39.602
- Your pledge leader.
- Attention!

08:39.773 --> 08:41.206
Busters.

08:42.453 --> 08:45.923
I hope you like your new uniforms.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.244
You will be wearing them for a week.

08:49.413 --> 08:51.324
Excuse me, Mr. Top Dog, sir.

08:51.493 --> 08:55.281
Pledge Banks, you only speak
when you are spoken to.

08:55.453 --> 08:58.013
Well, are you speaking to me now,
or are you?

09:00.293 --> 09:02.568
I'm sorry, but I think
everyone here will agree...

09:02.733 --> 09:07.443
...that wearing the same thing for a
week is not good hygiene. Right, fellas?

09:10.253 --> 09:12.721
So Pledge Banks likes
to wash clothes.

09:13.413 --> 09:16.450
Actually, my butler handles
the laundry.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.728
- Your butler?
- Yes, Geoffrey.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.851
He's a whiz with my fine washables.

09:25.813 --> 09:28.281
Pledge Banks, where are you from?

09:28.453 --> 09:29.727
Bel-Air.

09:29.893 --> 09:32.168
South central Bel-Air.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.882
I live right across the street
from the Aaron Spelling mansion.

09:38.413 --> 09:42.247
<i>You know,
the producer of Beverly Hills, 90210?</i>

09:42.413 --> 09:44.973
- I don't watch it.
- You don't know what you're missing.

09:45.133 --> 09:47.806
Dylan's on the verge
of getting back with Brenda.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.569
You are on the verge
of making a fool out of yourself.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.042
They really
getting back together, though?

10:01.053 --> 10:04.090
It looks like to me
our floor needs a little scrub.

10:04.253 --> 10:07.450
And a wax and a polish too,
I might add.

10:07.613 --> 10:09.365
It's a good idea, Pledge Banks.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.330
Pledges, get busy.

10:11.493 --> 10:14.485
And you can thank Pledge Banks
for doubling your workload.

10:15.133 --> 10:18.045
No need to thank him all at once,
fellas.

10:20.693 --> 10:23.207
- What's up with that fool?
- Who?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.250
Who? Will's cousin.

10:25.413 --> 10:27.483
Brother from another planet.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.644
Come on now, Dog,
you hardly know the guy.

10:30.813 --> 10:32.485
I know all I need to know.

10:32.653 --> 10:35.121
I'm gonna teach him
the true meaning of "hell week."

10:46.733 --> 10:49.201
Hello, you poor excuses for pledges.

10:49.573 --> 10:52.883
Greetings, big Brother Top Dog
of Phi Beta Gamma.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.362
Today, we're splitting up into groups.

10:55.533 --> 10:59.606
I'm taking Philly boy
and money bags to block.

10:59.773 --> 11:02.685
<i>Hey, we're gonna play
Hollywood Squares.</i>

12:15.933 --> 12:18.083
Hey, Carlton.

12:18.253 --> 12:21.484
Do you realize that they're working you
harder than everybody else?

12:21.653 --> 12:22.927
Nonsense.

12:23.093 --> 12:26.449
Everyone had to help
re-tar the parking lot.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.969
Yeah, but the rest of us
got to wear shoes.

12:30.413 --> 12:34.042
Yeah, well, it'll all be worth it
when I hear them call me "brother."

12:42.733 --> 12:46.408
I gotta tell you, Top Dog, I don't like
what you're doing with Brother Banks.

12:46.573 --> 12:48.450
I didn't ask you.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.646
<i>Lazlo, how could you?</i>

12:55.813 --> 12:58.202
<i>Mary, I couldn 't help myself.</i>

12:58.733 --> 13:01.850
Well, Ashley, the museum closed?

13:02.533 --> 13:06.048
I had no idea
how much Mary was suffering.

13:07.573 --> 13:09.404
Damn that Lazlo.

13:11.093 --> 13:13.402
Ashley, he doesn't know
how much his actions...

13:13.573 --> 13:15.370
...are hurting the people
who love him.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.603
That's because he's selfish
and self-centered.

13:17.773 --> 13:20.685
I see your mother's been
poisoning your minds.

13:23.373 --> 13:24.965
Vivian.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.203
Look, I've come to my senses.

13:28.373 --> 13:30.011
The bike is gone.

13:30.173 --> 13:32.368
- It is?
- Yes, sweetheart.

13:32.533 --> 13:35.684
Motorcycles and black leather
will never make me feel as young...

13:35.853 --> 13:37.286
...as the love of a good woman.

13:39.173 --> 13:43.644
With you by my side,
I will never grow old.

13:43.813 --> 13:45.485
I love you.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.762
Oh, sir, the body shop called.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.572
They said your motorcycle
is completely totaled.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.007
Thank you, Geoffrey.

13:58.173 --> 14:00.607
Oh, and the insurance company said...

14:00.773 --> 14:04.766
...you're covered for the damages
to the ice-cream truck...

14:04.933 --> 14:07.891
...but have to pay
for that box of Eskimo Pies you ate.

14:10.013 --> 14:12.163
I said, thank you, Geoffrey.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.607
My pleasure, sir.

14:13.773 --> 14:16.685
Will there be anything else?
My favorite soap is about to start.

14:16.853 --> 14:19.651
<i>What would that be,
One Life To Ruin?</i>

14:20.853 --> 14:22.844
Sir.

14:27.013 --> 14:30.369
Well, if I told you the truth,
you would have said, "I told you so."

14:30.533 --> 14:31.932
Try me.

14:32.093 --> 14:35.563
Okay, well, I accidentally left
the bike in gear...

14:35.733 --> 14:39.123
...and it ran into a Mr. Icy Pop truck.

14:39.293 --> 14:41.887
- I knew that bike was dangerous.
- That's an "I told you so."

14:42.053 --> 14:43.327
- It is not.
- Is too.

14:43.493 --> 14:45.051
Philip, what do you want from me?

14:45.213 --> 14:47.010
I don't know.

14:47.173 --> 14:49.004
A kiss.

14:50.493 --> 14:53.291
I broke my bike.

15:05.333 --> 15:09.451
Here I go.
Ladies, let the games begin.

15:09.613 --> 15:11.649
Don't you think it's cruel
to have a party...

15:11.813 --> 15:13.929
...before they tell us
whether we're in or not?

15:14.093 --> 15:17.165
Well, of course, it's cruel, Carlton,
but look on the bright side...

15:17.333 --> 15:19.608
...next year we get to do it
to somebody else.

15:19.773 --> 15:21.286
Do you really think we made it?

15:21.453 --> 15:25.492
Hey, look, man, whether we did or not,
you hung in there, and I'm proud of you.

15:26.413 --> 15:27.812
You're proud of me?

15:27.973 --> 15:30.771
You've never said that to me before
in my life.

15:30.933 --> 15:33.811
<i>- Give me a hug.
- Don 't.</i>

15:33.973 --> 15:37.329
You see, man, that is exactly
why I'll never tell you nothing.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.089
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

15:53.573 --> 15:56.451
Girl, if God made anything
prettier than you...

15:56.613 --> 15:59.207
...I hope he kept it for himself.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.691
Okay.

16:04.373 --> 16:06.329
Yo, Dog, did you see baby?

16:06.493 --> 16:07.812
Yo, she was fine.

16:07.973 --> 16:10.771
Yeah, that's just the tip
of the iceberg, my brother.

16:10.933 --> 16:13.606
Well then, mush, you huskies.

16:14.453 --> 16:17.047
Hey, Top Dog, do you think
the DJ has any Rod Stewart...

16:17.213 --> 16:19.010
...or Neil Diamond?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.249
Gee, Carlton, I don't know.

16:22.413 --> 16:25.962
The last time we played them,
the party just kind of got out of hand.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.168
I know what you mean.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.052
You should see what happens
at their concerts.

16:31.213 --> 16:33.602
Yo, homey, I'm not supposed
to say anything...

16:33.773 --> 16:36.003
...but you have nothing
to worry about.

16:36.173 --> 16:37.606
You're in.

16:37.773 --> 16:41.812
- Your word, me and Carlton got in?
- Well, not exactly.

16:41.973 --> 16:44.168
I mean, you're cool and all,
but Carlton...

16:44.333 --> 16:46.403
...well, he's not exactly our type.

16:53.893 --> 16:57.124
Say, what do you mean, "not our type"?

16:57.293 --> 16:59.727
Well, Carlton is not like you and me.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.804
You know what I'm saying?

17:01.973 --> 17:03.611
No, I don't know what you're saying.

17:03.773 --> 17:10.087
Will, Carlton doesn't exactly exemplify
what I think a Phi Beta Gamma is.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.729
Oh, and what is that?

17:12.893 --> 17:14.611
Well, it's not Ralph Lauren shirts...

17:14.772 --> 17:16.763
...wingtip shoes
and corporate America.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.492
We don't need a brother like him
in this fraternity.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.810
Man, he is exactly what you need
in this fraternity.

17:23.973 --> 17:26.851
I mean, Carlton has been
a straight-A student since preschool.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.447
He gives you 150 percent every time.

17:29.613 --> 17:33.606
Look, Will, I realize he's your cousin
and you have to defend him...

17:33.773 --> 17:36.446
...but this discussion is closed.

17:39.253 --> 17:40.845
All right.

17:42.293 --> 17:43.806
Carlton.

17:50.693 --> 17:53.127
Carlton, Carlton.

17:53.293 --> 17:54.931
Come on, let's go, I didn't get in.

17:55.093 --> 17:56.367
What? Why?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.808
Look, I don't know, man.
Come on, just let's go.

18:00.693 --> 18:02.251
How dare you not take Will.

18:02.413 --> 18:03.766
He's full of potential.

18:03.933 --> 18:07.164
That's why we want him.
It's you we don't want.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.051
Me?

18:11.493 --> 18:13.006
But I did everything.

18:13.173 --> 18:15.926
I cooked, I cleaned,
I hand-washed your toilets.

18:16.093 --> 18:17.890
Everything your butler does for you.

18:18.053 --> 18:22.729
I'm not accepting no prep school,
Bel-Air bred sellout into my fraternity.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.884
- Homey, you can stop all that...
- Wait, Will.

18:25.053 --> 18:27.009
I got this one.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.242
You think I'm a sellout, why?

18:32.813 --> 18:36.010
Because I live in a big house
or I dress a certain way?

18:36.173 --> 18:38.448
Or maybe it's because
I like Barry Manilow.

18:38.613 --> 18:40.968
He mean Barry White, y'all.

18:43.053 --> 18:46.762
Being black isn't what I'm trying to be,
it's what I am.

18:46.933 --> 18:49.925
I'm running the same race
and jumping the same hurdles you are...

18:50.093 --> 18:51.970
...so why are you tripping me up?

18:52.573 --> 18:54.291
You said we need to stick together...

18:54.453 --> 18:56.728
...but you don't even know
what that means.

18:56.893 --> 18:59.088
If you ask me, you're the real sellout.

19:06.453 --> 19:08.887
Yeah, that's right, boy.

19:09.053 --> 19:11.362
And in the words
of my illustrious cousin:

19:11.533 --> 19:14.252
"We will make like a tree and leave."

19:19.773 --> 19:23.402
Hey, look, you don't speak
for the rest of us, Dog.

19:23.573 --> 19:26.007
I'm gonna have you
kicked out of here.

19:28.213 --> 19:30.090
"Make like a tree and leave"?

19:30.253 --> 19:31.527
I never say that.

19:31.693 --> 19:34.082
It's "make like a banana and split."

19:36.253 --> 19:38.562
I'll keep that in mind, all right?

19:45.253 --> 19:47.972
<i>Lazlo, how could you?</i>

19:48.133 --> 19:52.285
<i>Oh, get over it, Mary.
I'm leaving you for your brother.</i>

19:57.853 --> 20:00.890
Oh, you... You've got to tape this
for me tomorrow.

20:02.533 --> 20:04.967
Damn that Lazlo.

20:08.573 --> 20:11.292
Hey, are we looking
at the newest Phi Beta Gammas?

20:11.453 --> 20:15.002
No. Apparently, I'm not enough
of a brother to be a brother.

20:15.453 --> 20:16.772
What?

20:17.853 --> 20:20.970
Pledge leader said
he didn't like sellouts.

20:21.773 --> 20:23.047
Well, who does?

20:23.213 --> 20:24.532
I mean, you wait and wait...

20:24.693 --> 20:28.891
...and when you finally get to the front
of the line, everything's gone.

20:30.373 --> 20:32.329
You know, this...

20:32.973 --> 20:35.168
This really irritates me.

20:35.773 --> 20:38.810
I have worked very hard
to give my family a good life...

20:38.973 --> 20:42.682
...and suddenly somebody tells me
there's a penalty for success.

20:44.413 --> 20:46.881
I'm sorry
you had to go through this, son.

20:51.293 --> 20:54.808
When are we gonna stop doing this
to each other?

21:03.133 --> 21:06.125
Well, I wouldn't have to go down
to juvenile hall, would I?

21:06.293 --> 21:08.409
I mean, I hear those kids really are...

21:08.573 --> 21:10.564
...you know, bad and messed up.

21:10.733 --> 21:13.486
- Excuse me.
- And I'm gonna go... Yeah. Wow.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.448
Ja... Well, the Kamma...

21:15.613 --> 21:17.524
- The Jamma Gammas are...
- The Ja... The who?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.285
- The Jamma Gammas.
- The... The...

21:19.453 --> 21:22.604
- The bad mama jamma.
- The bad mama jammas, yeah.

21:23.093 --> 21:27.052
I hope Mary dumps that so... See?

21:27.973 --> 21:32.683
- The... The... The bad mama jamma.
- The bad mama jammas, yeah.
