WEBVTT

03:02.390 --> 03:03.432
Whisky.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.353
We ain't got no whisky.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.941
Cold beer.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.986
We ain't got no cold beer.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.031
What are they drinking?

03:19.949 --> 03:21.241
Warm beer.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.161
Give me a warm beer.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.887
How far is it to Tombstone?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.182
Hey, cowboy.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.309
How far to Tombstone?

03:49.771 --> 03:50.979
Who wants to know?

03:59.447 --> 04:00.781
This gentleman here.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.867
He wants to know
how far to Tombstone.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.494
Depends.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.580
Whether he can ride or not.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.960
Maybe a day.
Maybe three days.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.630
For a dude, maybe a month.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.600
You a gambler...

04:29.811 --> 04:30.811
...cowboy?

04:30.979 --> 04:31.979
Yeah.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.190
I gamble, dude.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.236
Play you for the lady.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.532
I ain't gonna play you for the lady.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.741
Why not?

04:45.868 --> 04:47.786
'Cause me and her's in love!

04:49.163 --> 04:50.872
I'm gonna take her out to the ranch.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.125
Have a big weddin'.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.919
Raise cattle.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.005
Live happy ever after.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.048
You're talkin' cowshit, Ike Clanton.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.968
Let's play one hand.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.761
Five card stud.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.515
My horse against your...

05:09.976 --> 05:10.934
...lady.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.647
You don't own me, Ike.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.527
Then let's say I done rented ya.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.159
Why don't you play the gentleman...

05:27.243 --> 05:28.243
...for the rent?

05:31.831 --> 05:32.873
Sit down, dude.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.335
Jorge, bring us some cards!

05:36.627 --> 05:38.086
We ain't got no cards.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.546
I got some cards.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.342
You don't think I'd play
with your cards do you?

05:48.514 --> 05:49.598
Look 'em over.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.949
I guess they look okay.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.660
Let's let the lady cut for deal.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.662
She'll cut for you first, then for me.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.296
Pair of tens.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.992
You can reach for it
if you want to, cowboy.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.745
But if you do, you're gonna
end up with two assholes

08:16.829 --> 08:18.914
and one of them's gonna be
right between your eyes.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.126
Now get the hell out of here.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.320
I'll see you in Tombstone, dude.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.364
Could be.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.301
Got a room?

09:13.886 --> 09:14.886
In there.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.313
Let's go.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.569
The name's John Holliday.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.279
Doc,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.114
some people call me.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.157
Kate Elder.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.285
I'm gonna need a tub of hot water.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.411
We ain't got no hot water.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.830
Goddam it, build a fire
and heat some water.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.876
I gotta wash this bitch.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.450
Where are you going, dude?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.077
Tombstone.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.245
I gotta see somebody there.

11:05.289 --> 11:05.997
Woman?

11:06.999 --> 11:07.540
No.

11:08.167 --> 11:08.958
A friend.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.586
I'm ready.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.265
This is the ass end of the West, Doc.
It ain't even got a name.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.269
I had a ride to Tombstone with
Ike Clanton. At least that far.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.021
You busted that up. You won me.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.106
Look lady

11:31.232 --> 11:32.524
where I go, I go alone.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.401
I don't travel with anybody.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.154
Okay.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.342
Let's go.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.015
That's $3.50 you owe me for the food

12:06.225 --> 12:07.308
and the room.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.769
$3.50?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.440
Here's $4.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.233
Keep the change.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.321
Gringo cabrones.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.783
Pendejos.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.168
Doc, when are we
gonna get some water?

12:33.669 --> 12:35.462
Not till we see the mountains.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.422
We got a long ride yet.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.659
Now we can have some water.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.453
Thank Jesus!

13:18.422 --> 13:19.798
Son-of-a-bitch!

13:20.257 --> 13:22.091
- It's vinegar.
- Mexican greaser.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.927
Vinegar.

13:24.845 --> 13:25.512
Oh, Doc!

13:25.638 --> 13:28.890
Come on now, we've got to save our energy.
We got a long ride to those mountains.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.309
(Kate) Bastard!

13:31.393 --> 13:33.478
Still fighting the Mexican war.

14:02.299 --> 14:47.677
Doc...

14:51.932 --> 14:52.932
It's you!

14:58.272 --> 14:59.272
Where are we?

14:59.982 --> 15:00.982
Mountains.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.320
We should be in Tombstone tomorrow
afternoon, if we are where I think we are.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.988
We got something to eat?

15:07.406 --> 15:10.158
Well, there's some salt beef
and beans right there next to the fire.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.047
Beans make you fart.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.508
Just stay away from me!

15:29.136 --> 15:30.136
Bastard!

15:31.805 --> 15:32.680
Whore.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.391
Killer.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.518
What do you mean, "killer"?

15:38.145 --> 15:41.230
Figured you for a gunfighter the minute
you walked into that pigsty back there.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.943
The way you walked
with your right hand hanging loose.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.528
The way you looked around the room
like there was...

15:47.988 --> 15:50.365
...a rattler hiding in the pickle barrel.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.284
A little baby gun you keep in your vest.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.204
I been on the line four years, Doc.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.164
Gotta learn something.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.542
I ain't killed a man in a long time.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.171
I ain't screwed a man since I was twelve.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.304
You cleaned me up.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.682
You got real doctor's hands.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.891
Dentist's.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.768
Dentist's?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.812
Yeah, I was a dentist once.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.985
What do you think of that?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.571
Any good?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.241
Well, it's not bad.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.492
Good.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.413
Doc?

16:42.751 --> 16:45.336
I ain't never done it
in the mountains before.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.254
Now look,

16:46.547 --> 16:48.548
we got to start early in the morning.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.008
Good night.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.094
You're a mean,

16:54.471 --> 16:55.471
rat livered,

16:56.306 --> 16:57.306
heartless,

16:57.725 --> 16:59.183
lonesome creature.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.608
Listen, Katie Elder.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.736
What?

17:09.819 --> 17:12.320
If you gotta break wind,
would you turn the other way?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.615
'Cause you're aimed right at the fire,
and you might blow us both up

17:14.700 --> 17:15.992
and I've got to get to Tombstone!

17:16.117 --> 17:17.160
Suck grass.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.579
(Whispers) "Lonesome."

17:45.147 --> 17:46.564
Straighten up, woman.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.609
You gonna get your picture took, Doc?

17:49.818 --> 17:50.818
Could be.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.802
Is that your friend?
The one you're looking for?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.887
That's probably the Major.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.182
Some of your friends?

18:22.976 --> 18:25.394
Oh, just a few workin' girls, Doc.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.313
Servants

18:27.397 --> 18:28.773
for the likes of you.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.776
She looks like she does
most of her serving with her mouth.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.611
Ola.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.172
End of the line, Kate.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.639
Much obliged.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.737
See you around, dude.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.998
- Hey, curly.
- Howdy, pretty lady

19:27.082 --> 19:28.875
- You prospectin'?
- That's right.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.627
Why, you stick with me,
I'll bring you luck.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.629
(Man in crowd) A new girl in town!

19:36.091 --> 19:37.133
My name's Kate.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.345
- Hey, you stayin' for a while?
- Well, if this town's got any action...

19:41.847 --> 19:43.848
...I'm stayin' right across the square.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.349
Come round, the name's Kate.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.901
Open up, sisters!

19:56.570 --> 19:58.321
Back to work.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.824
I'll need a bottle of whisky, a bath
and place to put my horse.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.534
I'll have the boy take care of that.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.287
Do you know Wyatt Earp?

20:06.580 --> 20:07.705
The Marshal?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.041
Tell him Doc's in town.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.430
Son-of-a--

22:38.982 --> 22:39.815
Hello, Wyatt.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.275
Hello, John.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.871
Let's go get a drink.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.707
Five whiskies, here.

22:58.001 --> 23:02.380
Tonight's the night when we teach the kid
how to drink some rye whisky.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.715
Oh, leave the kid alone, Ike.
He don't drink whisky.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.050
He don't even like beer.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.928
- Johnny Ring
- Oh, Concha!

23:13.141 --> 23:16.519
Or maybe what the kid really needs

23:16.937 --> 23:19.021
is to get his pole greased.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.316
Me oh my! Fresh meat!

23:22.943 --> 23:25.945
That's something Concha knows
How to treat good, huh?

23:26.029 --> 23:28.656
Come on, let me see it.
I wanna see it, huh?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.658
No, Concha's not gonna hurt you, baby.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.410
Ooooh, Concha's gonna...

23:40.168 --> 23:41.627
Well, well, well.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.587
Look who's here.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.214
Hello, cowboy.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.174
Hello, dude.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.343
Play some cards?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.724
Excuse me, gentlemen.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.905
Son-of-a-bitch!

24:10.949 --> 24:12.950
Forget it, Ike.
He's packing and you ain't.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.901
I see you've met Ike.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.736
I ran in to him.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.285
What's that all about?

24:57.787 --> 24:59.205
Ike, his brother, Billy.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.875
Frank McLowery, his kid brother.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.252
Little guy's Johnny Ringo.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.879
Trouble makers.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.380
Tryin' to make trouble for you?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.882
For anybody.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.718
They're bad people, John.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.389
Well, if there weren't bad people,
what would you do for a living, Marshal?

25:18.975 --> 25:20.267
Tell me about Tombstone.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.186
I mean, more than
what you said in the letter.

25:22.854 --> 25:23.896
It's wide open.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.107
The Sheriff here, John Behan,

25:27.901 --> 25:29.860
doesn't know how to organise a town.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.738
So I'm gonna run
against him in the election.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.324
The Sheriff's got all the power here.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.410
The Marshal's got a badge,
he's got some territory.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.538
He's got no jurisdiction in town.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.624
Gambling's heavy.
There's a lot of money around.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.961
It's wide open.
So you organise the gambling.

25:47.045 --> 25:47.920
Start right here.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.755
I run the law.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.216
You run the gambling.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.511
We'll both end up rich.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.807
Very rich!

26:01.309 --> 26:03.602
We sound like bad people, Wyatt.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.522
We are, John.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.111
A little game, compaňero?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.405
Como no?

26:32.215 --> 26:35.259
(Man in crowd)
Hey, Mr. Bartlett, whisky!

26:37.721 --> 26:39.930
And ten more.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.192
(Wolf whistles)

26:59.576 --> 27:02.202
Puta! Puta!

27:02.621 --> 27:04.663
My little Fort Griffith puta!

27:04.789 --> 27:06.790
- Hello, Ike.
- Come back to see ol' Ike, did ya?

27:06.875 --> 27:07.916
Well, not quite.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.918
Lemme see those cheaters, lovebird.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.589
You better get a note
from your Ma first, burrobrain!

27:13.715 --> 27:14.715
Come here, bitch!

27:28.104 --> 27:29.521
You stay outta this!

27:30.482 --> 27:31.482
Outside.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.734
You take off them guns.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.569
Get rid of that badge,
and I'll see if you're man enough

27:35.654 --> 27:36.820
to take me outside, Earp!

27:37.030 --> 27:37.863
Another time, Ike.

27:38.448 --> 27:38.906
Move!

28:03.264 --> 28:05.516
- Come on!
- I'm gonna stay a while, Ringo.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.353
Okay, but you watch your ass 'cause
that Wyatt Earp ain't right in his head.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.581
Your five

28:31.543 --> 28:32.376
and twenty more.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.053
Very impressive.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.390
He plays a nice game.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.229
- Nice to see you, Miss Kate.
- Hello, kid. How are you?

29:08.747 --> 29:09.747
Mr. Earp.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.249
Mr. Holliday.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.007
I'll be right back.

31:07.115 --> 31:07.948
Get him, Virgil!

31:08.074 --> 31:11.743
Come on! Get in there!
You got him, boy. Come on!

31:11.870 --> 31:13.996
Come on, we've got
people coming in an hour.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.914
Push it, push it. You got him.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.040
Come on, let's straighten up.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.209
- Just a little bit more.
- James.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.253
Virgil.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.504
Morgan.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.256
Howdy, brother.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.133
We've got people coming in an hour.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.310
Y'know, maybe we shoulda put
the pigs somewhere else for the day.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.854
You mean Virgil and Morgan?

31:50.700 --> 31:51.783
Let's go get a drink.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.458
Hi, Mark, how you doin'?

31:59.542 --> 32:00.626
Hi, how are you?

32:01.294 --> 32:02.210
Nice to see you.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.546
I'm gonna try. Thank you.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.049
It's not an easy thing to ask
a man who's carried a gun all his life

32:07.133 --> 32:07.925
to give it up.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.969
This is pretty much it.
Pretty much the way we'll conduct it.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.263
Just getting everybody around
and talkin' to them.

32:13.514 --> 32:14.514
Excuse my hand.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.433
Thank you very much.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.646
He's the fastest. He's the deadliest.
I'd say he's about the best

32:25.652 --> 32:28.820
(Young boy) All dressed in black, Pa.
All in black.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.864
That's really Doc Holliday?

32:31.324 --> 32:34.826
(Boy's father) That's him, son.
Take a good look and remember.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.081
James

32:39.874 --> 32:41.083
say hello to John.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.293
- Hello, James.
- Bless you, Doc!

32:43.419 --> 32:45.504
(Man's voice) I see Earp has
brought in the artillery.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.297
He sure must want
them Clantons bad.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.509
- What do you mean?
- I encountered him in Dodge.

32:51.052 --> 32:54.513
Him and Wyatt killed a lot of people.
He's Wyatt's heavy-guns.

32:54.597 --> 32:56.473
If Holliday's as good as I hear,

32:56.557 --> 32:58.934
the Clantons better start
thinking about moving on.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.186
Mattie?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.105
Hello, Mattie.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.690
Doc Holliday!

33:13.992 --> 33:15.117
(Second man)
How old a man is he?

33:15.201 --> 33:16.451
(First man) Hard telling.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.579
Talk says he's got the
consumption. Had it for years.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.623
Talk says he's already dying.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.418
He's fears no-one in a fight 'cause
he's got nothing to lose.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.713
- You believe the talk?
- Till I see otherwise.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.554
My friend, John Holliday.
Sheriff Johnny Behan.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.180
- Doc.
- Sheriff.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.725
When you leavin' town?

33:41.644 --> 33:44.604
Here's the man who supplied the whisky.
Owner of the Alhambra.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.815
Mr. Bartlett, John Holliday.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.358
Nice to meet you, Doc.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.446
Just a small campaign
contribution, Wyatt.

33:52.822 --> 33:53.780
(Mattie) Wyatt!

33:53.906 --> 33:55.782
Well, I'll leave you in his
hands forjust a second.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.701
Mattie's calling me,
I'll be right back.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.205
Doc, say hello to Mr. Clum.
The editor of the local newspaper,

34:02.331 --> 34:03.707
the Tombstone Epitaph.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.876
How long you planning
to stay in town?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.128
Well, that depends.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.547
On what?

34:15.344 --> 34:16.344
Excuse me.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.110
James!

34:33.196 --> 34:34.196
Son-of-a-bitch!

35:19.659 --> 35:20.992
Is there a Chinaman in town?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.828
Yeah, the end of Allen Street.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.788
Thanks.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.670
Good night, sir.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.592
Good night, Wong.

35:38.719 --> 35:41.138
Go with God, as Mexicans say.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.684
I will.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.569
- Mr Holliday?
- Hey!

35:56.279 --> 35:59.281
- It's me Mr. Holliday.
- Jesus Chirst, kid!

36:02.118 --> 36:04.119
You almost got your head blown off.

36:04.412 --> 36:07.122
Listen, if you're gonna call
a man from the dark like that

36:07.206 --> 36:08.874
you better plan on killin' him.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.334
Sorry, Mr. Holliday.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.838
My uncles would go crazy if
they saw me talkin' to you.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.632
Who?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.009
Ike and Billy Clanton.

36:19.135 --> 36:22.095
They think Wyatt Earp brought you
into town to kill them.

36:22.305 --> 36:27.809
Listen kid, you go tell your uncles
that Doc Holliday is a gambler.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.271
I don't kill people for other people.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.275
There's gonna be trouble,
Mr. Holliday.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.777
Not with me there isn't.

36:38.112 --> 36:39.196
Lots of trouble.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.324
Wyatt don't like Ike Clanton.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.617
Or us.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.703
I ain't sure why,
but there's gonna be bad trouble

36:46.913 --> 36:49.331
And that's why I came
to see you, Mr. Holliday.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.085
I want you to teach me how to shoot.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.008
Why?

37:01.844 --> 37:05.180
So you and your uncles
can kill Wyatt better?

37:06.724 --> 37:07.724
Or me?

37:08.267 --> 37:11.311
Oh no, Mr. Holliday.
I'd never kill you.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.024
Forget about guns.

37:19.445 --> 37:24.032
Ike promised my mother before she died
that he'd never let me be a gunfighter.

37:25.534 --> 37:29.412
So drinking's all right,
and punching cattle's all right

37:30.122 --> 37:31.373
but shootin' aint'.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.210
I gotta learn, Mr. Holliday.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.633
Why'd you come after me,
not somebody else?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.511
'Cause they say
you're the best there is.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.598
'Cause I read all about you
in them darn novels, Mr. Holliday.

37:48.766 --> 37:49.766
'Cause...

37:50.726 --> 37:52.227
'cause you're a legend.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.229
All right, kid.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.982
Now wait... hold it now!

37:57.525 --> 37:58.525
Kid...

37:59.402 --> 38:00.860
you'd be dead by now.

38:00.945 --> 38:04.239
I mean fanning's all right.
It's very fast. But it's not very accurate.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.700
And accuracy is much
more important than speed.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.415
You see, the important thing
is to get you arm all the way out

38:13.541 --> 38:15.458
so you have the target
right in your sights.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.587
That's important. The other important
thing is to relax so you can concentrate.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.011
Okay.

38:26.971 --> 38:27.637
Take your time.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.140
That's good.
That's real good!

38:32.768 --> 38:33.518
Nice shot!

38:35.604 --> 38:36.604
Let's go home.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.610
You know, sometimes I feel
like a goddam school teacher.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.821
Who taught you, Mr. Holliday?

38:45.197 --> 38:46.197
My Daddy.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.034
- Is he still alive?
- No, no.

38:50.077 --> 38:51.995
He went off to fight in the war.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.539
When they lost,
that just about killed him.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.376
By the time he got home, everything
he knew was gone, including me.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.045
Where did you go?

39:00.379 --> 39:02.547
Oh, I went up to Richmond first.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.716
Then to Baltimore.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.136
My Mother sent me up there
to get an education.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.932
You, er...?

39:13.476 --> 39:14.476
Sure!

39:18.522 --> 39:20.857
Yeah, I studied dentistry up there.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.401
And then...

39:24.320 --> 39:27.697
they told me that I had to come
to the West. The doctors.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.407
For my health.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.874
And after that I ended up at Fort Griffith.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.001
Then went to Dodge.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.046
I've been all over.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.176
Do you ever go home?

39:48.844 --> 39:49.844
Every night.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.044
Pistol-whip anybody today, Marshal?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.097
Don't try me, Ike.

40:49.363 --> 40:50.738
One of these days...

40:52.783 --> 40:55.285
I'm gonna have to try Mr. Earp.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.500
Well, hello, dude.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.377
You wanna dance?

41:04.837 --> 41:05.837
Let's go!

41:11.802 --> 41:12.802
God!

42:33.217 --> 42:35.426
What time have you got, Bartlett?

42:39.848 --> 42:40.848
Just after two.

42:49.775 --> 42:50.733
Kate!

42:51.610 --> 42:52.735
Whare the hell's Kate?

42:52.820 --> 42:53.820
She's working.

42:54.071 --> 42:54.571
Kate!

42:54.655 --> 42:56.489
Quite! You'll wake the dead.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.740
Kate!

42:59.285 --> 43:00.285
Excuse me, sir.

43:00.744 --> 43:01.786
Come on, bitch.
Get off your back.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.455
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're coming with me!

43:04.540 --> 43:06.958
You crazy son-of-a-bitch!
You put me down!

43:07.376 --> 43:09.419
Take it easy. Take it easy now!

43:10.254 --> 43:11.963
You crazy son-of-a-bitch!

43:12.089 --> 43:14.299
That's right. Come on old girl.

43:14.550 --> 43:18.469
Doc, I ain't got no clothes. I can't come
onto the street with no clothes on.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.513
Concha!

43:20.973 --> 43:24.183
Concha, get the law after this
crazy son-of-a-bitch.

43:24.518 --> 43:25.518
Put me down!

43:28.105 --> 43:29.856
Concha, I love you.

43:30.316 --> 43:31.399
Come on darlin'!

43:43.245 --> 43:44.746
What the hell is this?

43:45.831 --> 43:47.540
You're off the line, Kate.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.083
I just retired you.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.173
I'll see you in the morning.

44:04.141 --> 44:05.141
Mornin'.

44:08.771 --> 44:09.520
Good morning.

44:15.694 --> 44:16.736
This is for you.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.352
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?

44:52.606 --> 44:53.606
It's beautiful.

44:59.655 --> 45:00.655
It's beautiful!

45:05.869 --> 45:07.203
You like it? Really like it?

45:09.623 --> 45:10.623
I love it.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.216
Come on, put it on.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.343
Okay.

45:22.886 --> 45:23.886
Um....

45:24.346 --> 45:26.347
I'd better take a bath first.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.184
Well, hurry out though, 'cause...

45:32.938 --> 45:34.439
we got places to go.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.278
What do you think?

45:41.947 --> 45:42.947
I like it.

45:44.241 --> 45:46.075
Okay. Take it over and print it.

45:59.173 --> 45:59.964
Mornin'.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.048
Mornin', Wyatt.

46:02.468 --> 46:03.092
Katie.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.177
Mornin', Wyatt.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.346
Come on.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.512
Well...

46:51.934 --> 46:52.934
here it is.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.395
Territorial prison in Yuma
wouldn't suit us better.

46:57.815 --> 47:01.359
Now listen,
a man's home is his castle.

47:02.402 --> 47:03.402
Shit!

47:03.487 --> 47:05.238
Come on. Let's go inside.

47:08.659 --> 47:09.659
Wait a minute.

47:10.118 --> 47:10.743
Er...

47:10.828 --> 47:11.828
Uh, no, no.

47:11.995 --> 47:13.579
- Katie, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- We gotta do this right.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.040
- Somebody's going to see us, Kate.
- That's for backing out!

47:17.084 --> 47:19.210
What if somebody were to see us?

47:21.672 --> 47:22.672
Nice.

47:25.342 --> 47:26.801
That son-of-a-bitch.

47:27.636 --> 47:28.636
What?

47:30.848 --> 47:32.098
What's the matter, Doc?

47:34.101 --> 47:35.476
The man who rented this place to me

47:35.561 --> 47:37.812
promised he'd have it cleaned
before we moved in.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.146
Well, cleaned...

47:39.356 --> 47:40.439
That's the least of--

47:40.524 --> 47:42.692
We can have
this place clean in an hour, Doc.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.360
That's not a problem.
How's the bed?

47:44.611 --> 47:45.236
Hmm?

47:45.737 --> 47:46.696
It's a good bed.

47:46.780 --> 47:47.363
Yeah.

47:47.447 --> 47:48.447
Sturdy, yeah.

47:49.408 --> 47:51.158
It's big enough for a midget.

47:52.035 --> 47:54.245
Well, you're pretty skinny, dude.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.164
Look at this place, it's a mess.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.333
Put some curtains up here,
get this window fixed.

47:59.835 --> 48:00.835
It's all right.

48:01.628 --> 48:02.753
And we got a table.

48:04.798 --> 48:05.882
I'm sorry, Kate.

48:06.425 --> 48:09.385
I should have looked at the place
before I signed the deal.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.054
Doc...

48:14.683 --> 48:16.642
it's gonna be fine.

48:46.381 --> 48:47.632
(Knock at the door)

48:48.508 --> 48:49.675
John?

48:51.136 --> 48:52.136
(Whispers) He's asleep.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.138
Will you wake him up, please.
It's important.

49:01.688 --> 49:03.189
(Gently) Doc Holliday?

49:10.322 --> 49:12.448
Your friend Wyatt's at the door.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.200
I know.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.164
Just a second, Wyatt,
I'll be right there.

49:25.253 --> 49:25.878
Wyatt.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.589
Someone held up the stage.
Got the gold shipment.

49:28.966 --> 49:29.966
$80,000.

49:31.009 --> 49:31.884
80?

49:31.969 --> 49:33.260
Wanna go after 'em?

49:34.638 --> 49:35.888
I'll be right with you.

49:38.767 --> 49:39.392
Darlin'.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.184
Yeah?

49:42.187 --> 49:43.646
Will you give me a hand?

49:44.523 --> 49:45.398
Sure.

49:46.441 --> 49:47.900
I've gotta go.

49:53.407 --> 49:54.699
You don't mind, do you?

49:57.244 --> 49:58.160
No.

50:19.808 --> 50:21.100
Tracks southwest.

50:22.060 --> 50:23.853
Toward the Clanton spread.

50:24.646 --> 50:25.646
Ike Clanton?

50:26.273 --> 50:28.065
It wouldn't be Ike Clanton.

50:28.275 --> 50:29.942
More likely Johny Ringo.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.002
What the hell's happening, kid?

50:48.086 --> 50:49.086
Trouble...

50:49.546 --> 50:50.546
Ike!

51:00.140 --> 51:02.099
Goddam it, Ike,
what'd you do that for?

51:02.225 --> 51:03.350
Ringo!

51:05.353 --> 51:07.271
Where is that half-breed
son-of-a-bitch?

51:07.355 --> 51:08.481
Ain't seen him in a couple of days.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.524
Might be down the valley
with the herd, why?

51:10.650 --> 51:12.943
Because somebody held up
the gold shipment, that's why.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.362
For $80,000, that's why.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.491
And sure as shit the law's
gonna be coming looking for us!

51:18.909 --> 51:19.909
That's why!

51:20.911 --> 51:23.037
Get off your asses. Find him!

51:25.040 --> 51:26.040
Hey, Ike,

51:26.792 --> 51:30.294
we got a couple of visitors.
Way down in the draw.

51:39.721 --> 51:41.222
Well, get out of sight.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.599
Get guns. Get hid.
Give me your gun.

51:55.278 --> 51:56.320
I don't like it.

52:42.450 --> 52:44.910
I'm gonna give you
fair warning, Marshal.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.376
Get off my ranch.

52:53.420 --> 52:55.754
Looking for some Wells Fargo gold.

52:57.215 --> 52:58.340
And the man who stole it.

52:58.508 --> 53:01.510
Nobody here had anything
to do with that gold.

53:02.971 --> 53:04.638
And we don't steal money.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.144
Where's Johnny Ringo?

53:11.938 --> 53:13.063
I ain't seen him.

53:15.942 --> 53:17.484
You're a liar, Ike.

53:38.256 --> 53:39.840
A little different, ain't it?

53:57.567 --> 53:58.651
Marshal...

54:01.279 --> 54:02.446
I'm gonna try ya.

54:56.751 --> 54:57.793
You ain't...

54:58.586 --> 55:00.879
so much without them guns,
are you, Earp?

55:05.135 --> 55:07.219
You ain't shit!

55:10.849 --> 55:11.974
That's enough, Ike!

55:12.100 --> 55:13.142
I ain't finished!

55:16.688 --> 55:17.563
He is.

55:22.902 --> 55:24.486
Get him the hell outta here.

56:07.947 --> 56:08.822
I'm gonna kill him.

56:11.951 --> 56:12.951
Let it go, Wyatt.

56:16.873 --> 56:18.248
I'm gonna have to kill him.

56:18.375 --> 56:19.708
Forget it, Wyatt!

56:20.794 --> 56:21.502
It's over.

56:25.173 --> 56:26.840
I'm gonna kill him, John.

56:27.884 --> 56:30.803
Where in the hell you been, brother?
We thought you was bushwacked.

56:32.305 --> 56:33.806
(Morgan)
Glad you're back, Wyatt.

56:34.015 --> 56:38.143
Wells Fargo offered a $20,000 reward
for the hold-up men.

56:39.437 --> 56:40.437
Is that right?

56:40.688 --> 56:42.106
$20,000.

56:47.570 --> 56:49.822
Go in and get us something to eat.

56:50.657 --> 56:51.657
I'm hungry.

57:03.711 --> 57:04.920
Want something to eat?

57:05.255 --> 57:06.296
I better go home.

57:07.298 --> 57:08.090
Kate.

57:20.687 --> 57:21.687
James.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.110
Virgil?

57:28.945 --> 57:29.945
Yeah.

57:31.156 --> 57:32.698
Is Ike Clanton in town?

57:33.575 --> 57:35.617
He's down the Alhambrah
right this minute.

57:36.035 --> 57:37.744
Tell him I want to see him.

57:38.955 --> 57:40.873
Tell him I wanna
make a deal with him.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.375
What kind of deal?

57:46.379 --> 57:48.213
Ike didn't hold up the stage.

57:49.257 --> 57:50.591
It was Johnny Ringo.

57:52.427 --> 57:53.427
I want him.

57:55.555 --> 57:58.891
You tell Ike if he can
lead us to where Ringo is...

57:59.559 --> 58:01.310
he can have the reward.

58:02.770 --> 58:04.062
What the hell for?

58:06.483 --> 58:08.066
Ike gets the money.

58:09.110 --> 58:10.319
We get the credit.

58:11.654 --> 58:12.988
We get the election.

58:14.407 --> 58:16.408
Then we clean up Tombstone.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.536
You mean clean out Tombstone.

58:32.008 --> 58:33.008
Go see Clanton.

58:37.472 --> 58:38.305
(Softly) Hello.

58:39.724 --> 58:40.182
Hello.

58:59.452 --> 59:00.118
My God!

59:02.455 --> 59:03.914
You like it, flat-ass?

59:06.668 --> 59:07.668
Yes.

59:08.461 --> 59:09.461
I like it.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.386
I got you a present.

59:23.518 --> 59:24.226
For me?

59:25.019 --> 59:26.228
It's a night shirt.

59:28.106 --> 59:29.106
What's it...?

59:32.193 --> 59:33.986
Um... special occasions.

59:35.071 --> 59:36.154
You sweet bitch!

59:56.509 --> 59:57.676
Come on, break it up.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.344
Who the hell are you?

59:59.512 --> 01:00:00.637
I'm the Marshal.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.598
And you boys are going to jail.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:03.807
Hell we are!

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.187
Pick up your friend, let's go.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.447
Wyatt.

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:21.158
Starting to take the easy ones?

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:26.246
(Kate) How did you
get to be a gambler, Doc?

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:33.962
(Doc) Just something
I picked up along the way.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.214
Like everything else.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:41.136
How'd you end up on the line?

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.181
I was born to it, John.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.268
You mean working girls
are born, not made?

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.603
No.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:51.188
Nothin' fancy.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:54.024
My Ma was a whore is all.

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.945
Did you ever meet your Father?

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.033
I don't think so.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.743
You don't think so?

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:08.914
No, my Ma said before she died,
that he was a cowboy.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.583
I rolled around with a lot of cowboys.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.056
Afternoon, Doc.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:28.767
Afternoon, Mr. Clum.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:37.526
Going to the big debate tonight?

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:39.945
I haven't really thought about it.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:42.864
Tell me, er...

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.993
why do you think Wyatt wants
to be Sheriff of Tombstone?

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.288
He's already Deputy Marshal
of the whole territory.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:52.958
You tell me.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.085
Money.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.716
How come Johnny Behan
isn't a rich man?

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.385
He's dumb.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.303
He's honest.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.556
You don't think Wyatt is honest?

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.392
No.

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:11.810
(Gunshots)

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:21.862
Oh, no!

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.615
- What are you doing?
- He was pushing me around!

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.327
Give me that gun, boy.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.288
Tim McCoy, Marshal.
They drew on the kid.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.459
We'll let the jury decide that.
Now move. Go on, move!

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.043
Easy Wyatt!

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.847
All right, Marshal.
I'll take care of it.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.225
I'll take his gun.

01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:09.534
Miss Elder?

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:12.078
Hello, Alley.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:13.955
Um, come on in.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:15.081
No, thank you.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.542
What can I do for you, then?

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:23.381
Have you ever thought
of going to church?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.303
Well, not lately. Why?

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:33.725
Well, we would like to see you go
to church at least once, Miss Elder.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:35.769
To get married.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:37.813
Alley...

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:43.985
when I want preaching
I'll go to church.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:49.199
But, for the moment,
when I'm on my knees...

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:52.202
it ain't in prayer.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.541
We've all got stakes in Tombstone.

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:02.045
We'll be here when all the others
have gone on through.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:06.800
So it's up to us to work
together for a better town.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:08.885
And a better future.

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:11.638
Thank you.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.481
Good evenin', Bartlett.

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:23.066
Hi, Doc.

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:27.362
All this politicking's
gonna ruin my business.

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:30.156
Now, I guess I've gotta
make something very clear.

01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:34.494
And that is that I'm
in Tombstone to stay.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.163
I think all of us here
want to stay.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.375
And I think we all want the town
to have a future.

01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:43.086
But it can't have a future
unless it prospers.

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.590
It can't prosper
with gunplay in the streets.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.176
Now, there's only one way
to get rid of the gun.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.971
And that's to use the gun.

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:55.849
Law's gotta be enforced.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.022
Well, I hope you'll let me
get the job done for us.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.066
For all our families.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.029
That's all.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:13.074
I hope you all get home safe.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.702
Thank you.

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:29.424
What did you think
of the speaking, Mr. Clum?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:30.926
Not bad...

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:33.553
...for patent medicine.

01:05:34.221 --> 01:05:35.180
You know, Mr. Clum,

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.765
I'm not a politician.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.685
I'm a peace officer.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:45.565
I think I know what, er,
Doc's after, Marshal.

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:48.693
What do you want?

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.864
I want to win, Mr. Clum.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:57.243
Good night, Marshal.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:58.995
Mr. Clum?

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:00.747
Yes?

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:03.291
What do you think it is?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.127
That Doc's after?

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:10.340
I'd say, er...

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.344
Some, er...

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.682
wild and permanent gesture of, er...

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:25.063
You're taking too long, Ike.
I need Ringo before the election.

01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:27.023
Suppose I change my mind?

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.525
You made a deal, Ike.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:29.776
That's right.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.986
I get $20,000.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:33.655
You get Ringo. You get to be Sheriff.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.659
And I get to be dead?

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.373
You want my ass out of the way, Earp.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:46.001
And I don't figure it's worth
$20,000 for me to help you.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.628
You've gotta deliver, Ike.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.130
I ain't gotta do shit.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.298
I've got the kid in jail.

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:55.301
He killed a man this afternoon.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:56.511
You're a liar!

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:01.808
Frank.

01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:05.645
Where's the kid?

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:07.689
Huh?

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:11.526
I dunno.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.280
You miserable son-of-a-bitch.

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:18.366
You deliver Ringo, Ike.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.452
Before the election.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:24.039
You'll get him.

01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.803
It sure makes you sleep good at night

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:43.391
knowing Wyatt Earp's
upholding the law. Don't it?

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.020
Gotta put at least a thousand
on him, Doc.

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:50.940
I think I can cover that.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.567
What do you wanna bail
him out for?

01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:54.652
Oh,

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:57.197
it's just a sense of
civic responsibility.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.077
I want him back in
three weeks for the trial.

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.371
Now, level with me, kid.

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:06.873
Why did you kill him?

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:08.541
He drew on me.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:12.087
He had a wife and two kids.
Did you know that?

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:13.546
No.

01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:18.259
How old are you?

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:19.844
I'm eighteen.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.890
What are you gonna do
with your life?

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:27.977
Don't you have any ambition?

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:29.312
Yes, Mr. Holliday.

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:30.688
What is it?

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:33.858
I wanna be like you.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.410
Get the hell outta here, kid.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.542
Hello, bones.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.377
Hello, bitch.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:08.225
Did you have a good day?

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.062
I had a visitor.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:12.772
Who?

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:13.939
Mrs. Alley Earp.

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.906
We had a talk about, erm...

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.492
the respectable people of Tombstone.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.746
About how you and me
are livin' in a state of sin.

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:31.332
You should have been here.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.798
You know...

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.428
I sat around here after she left,

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:44.888
thinkin',

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.473
'bout what we're doin' together.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:48.975
Where we're goin'.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.187
See, Doc...

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.024
I never was ashamed
of what I was before.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.317
My life then.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.028
I liked it, Doc.

01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:03.573
Well, I liked the money, first.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:06.284
But I liked the life, most.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:12.957
I didn't want to be some Minister's wife
stuck out on the goddam prairy.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:16.085
Him comin' in at night
smelling of sheep.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:17.879
Readin' the Bible....

01:10:19.089 --> 01:10:20.673
What are you drivin' at, Kate?

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.301
I wanted the towns, Doc.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.554
I wanted lights and music.

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:28.806
Dancin'.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.478
On the line I got 'em.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.858
Now, I got a lot of other things.
A lot of them was bad.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.528
But what was good...

01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:47.033
After I met you.

01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:52.288
I didn't want that life.

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:54.082
What do you want now?

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:58.461
I wanna go away.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.463
With you.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:04.676
Away...

01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:06.970
from this place.

01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:12.558
For how ever many years...

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:14.519
you got left.

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:22.944
I wanna have a child.

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:33.496
Nothin'...

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:35.832
Nothin' fancy, Doc.

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:46.175
What...

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:49.887
What do you want?

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:53.391
I don't know.

01:11:58.522 --> 01:12:00.732
Part of me wants the same things.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.818
And part of me wants...

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:07.905
something else.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:12.243
What?

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.541
What's "something else"?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.420
Why?

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:25.381
Doc.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:30.428
I don't care. For how ever
many years you've got left.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:33.222
Take now!

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.016
Take me!

01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.601
Take me...

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.981
For as long as you've got.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.069
Doc, wait a minute!
Please don't go.

01:12:46.278 --> 01:12:47.862
Doc, please.

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:49.113
Doc!

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:52.700
What is it, Virgil?

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.536
Doc Holliday
bailed out the kid, Wyatt.

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.705
Put up a thousand, cash money.

01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:14.138
When?

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.223
Last night.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:26.818
Well...

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:31.114
that ruins the deal, Virgil.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.407
I know.

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:36.119
What we gonna do, Wyatt?

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.207
Kill the Clantons.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.588
Katie, where's John?

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.673
He ain't home.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.259
Tell him I want to see him.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:52.760
Why should I, Wyatt?

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.597
Look, we better get
something straight, Katie.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.058
You don't own John Holliday.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:03.187
You got no rights whatever when it comes
to him. But I'll tell you something...

01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:05.940
Ever since you hooked on to him

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.234
he ain't been himself.

01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:10.611
Maybe he grew up.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.113
Yeah, maybe.

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:16.659
Or maybe the tricks you learned
on the line got him so tired

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:18.703
that he can't think straight.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:55.865
All night?

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.206
Buenas dias, Seňor Muerte.

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:48.876
Bailed out the kid?

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:50.711
Yeah.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.423
Caused some trouble.

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.593
Trouble with the Clantons.

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:00.763
Trouble with the Clantons?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.890
Your trouble,

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:05.309
not mine.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.563
You know, you've changed, Wyatt.

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:13.109
I don't understand you anymore.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.279
You don't understand me?

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.490
I've changed?

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:22.577
Well, I don't understand you.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.624
You know, there was a time

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:33.087
when my trouble
was your trouble.

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.256
And yours was mine.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.968
Times have changed.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.929
It's different.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.309
It's different, Wyatt.
I'll tell you why...

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.561
Because I got to learn something.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:51.981
I got to learn that
I'm not gonna live forever.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.233
And I got to learn that I...

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:56.944
I'm sick and tired of killing.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:58.946
I'm sick of it!

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:05.536
I'm sick of seeing young kids
gun down old men for bullshit reasons.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.790
I don't want that anymore, Wyatt.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.417
I don't understand it.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.210
I wanna...

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:18.132
I wanna leave something behind,
Wyatt.

01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:27.266
I wanna live.

01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:31.270
"Live"!

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:41.906
You sure Billy Clanton's
in the Oriental?

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:43.949
Positive.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:53.751
All right.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.089
I'd like you to go down,
talk to Billy.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.216
Real calm like.

01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:03.886
Tell him that the deal with Ike is off.

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.140
Tell him that I know that Ike's
been talking about the deal.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:11.936
So I'm gonna have
to teach him a lesson.

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:15.606
And I'm gonna bring charges
against Ike

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:17.149
and the kid

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:20.403
for the stagecoach hold-up.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.614
And I'm gonna charge Ike

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.494
for trying to bribe
a territorial officer.

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.122
Ike'll blow his stack, brother.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.540
I mean,

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:34.083
when Billy tells him.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.668
Ike'll be comin' after us.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:40.673
That's right.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.654
Where is Doc?

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:05.364
I looked everywhere.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.534
I tried every saloon in town.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.703
I can't find him!

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.333
- You better have a drink.
- I don't want a drink!

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:18.878
I wanna find Doc.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.173
Now, please, have you seen him?

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.549
You must have seen him.

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.134
Some time today.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:29.388
Haven't seen him
since this morning, Kate.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.224
(Pours a drink)

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:50.284
Why'd he leave?

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.038
We had some words.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.123
Well, everybody has words.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.503
This was about places we've been.

01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:06.217
And places we're goin'.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:10.763
He never took anybody
any place before.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.935
Maybe he never loved...

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:19.980
anyone before.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.026
You should try the Chinaman.

01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:29.490
The Chinaman?

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:34.203
(Chinaman whispers)
The Palace of Mirrors in Shanghai.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:37.206
I'd like you to see that.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:39.792
Manila...

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.127
(Doc, laughing)
Manila!

01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:43.963
(Chinaman) Siam.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.673
Siam.

01:20:46.132 --> 01:20:47.424
Across the seas.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.637
Where spices grow.

01:20:54.599 --> 01:20:57.476
(Doc) Across the seas
where spices grow...

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.646
You son-of-a-bitch!

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.441
Jesus Christ! Get up
goddam it! Get up.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.069
- Wait, wait!
- Look at yourself...

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.321
Wait, now just wait a min--

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.866
Wong and I are going
to the Palace of Mirrors.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:14.827
Well go! Goddam it, go!

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.620
Go on, burn!

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:18.831
(Screaming and shouting)

01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:21.542
(Man) Everybody out!

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.211
(Katie) Get out!

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:28.215
- You crazy bitch!
- Don't you dare touch me!

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.407
Maybe we can go away?

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:54.742
California?

01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:57.536
When?

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:58.621
Soon!

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.335
"Soon" ain't soon enough!

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:11.634
(He laughs)

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:30.110
Kid, go on in there.
See what's going on.

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:32.154
We'll see you at the Corral.

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.238
Be careful,

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.407
Earp sees ya, he'll kill ya.

01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:37.576
I swear to uphold the law

01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:40.037
for the territory of Arizona

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.790
and of the United States.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.585
So help me, God.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:53.676
Mr. Holliday.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.638
Hello, kid.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:00.891
Sit down.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:10.901
Would you like a drink?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.569
No, thanks, Mr. Holliday

01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:19.702
They're coming into town,
Mr. Holliday.

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.663
Who's coming into town?

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.958
The Clantons and the McLowerys.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.376
Why?

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.128
The Marshal made a deal with Ike.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:32.089
Ike was supposed to turn in Ringo
for the stage job.

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:34.466
Wyatt would give
Ike the reward money.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:36.719
Keep the glory for himself.

01:23:37.887 --> 01:23:39.972
And now, the Marshal says
the deal's off,

01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:43.392
and he's gonna hold Ike and me
for the stage job.

01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:45.936
How many are coming here?

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.190
Seven.

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:52.901
Counting me.

01:24:02.787 --> 01:24:04.163
Why are tellin' me this?

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.625
'Cause I don't want you to die,
Mr. Holliday.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:31.190
Into the camera.

01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:26.221
They're here.

01:26:28.224 --> 01:26:29.224
How many?

01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:31.059
Seven.

01:27:58.314 --> 01:27:59.189
How many?

01:27:59.315 --> 01:28:00.399
Three of Earp's.

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:01.817
And maybe Doc Holliday.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:04.528
Ike!

01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:07.322
Now, damn it, Ike, I don't want
no shootin' in the town limits.

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:08.657
Now, ya'll gimme your guns.

01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:10.701
You're gonna have to take them
away from us, Johnny.

01:28:10.827 --> 01:28:11.910
Ike, I don't want no trouble.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:14.037
You better tell that
to the goddam Marshal!

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:32.472
You can't do it, Wyatt.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.516
The town's myjurisdiction.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:37.477
Settle it in court, Johnny.

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:44.151
You're not gonna
solve anything with a gun.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.822
Oh, you'd be surprised the things
you can solve with a gun.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:28.945
Shotguns.

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:30.781
They got shotguns.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:36.870
Spread out.

01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:43.627
Spread out!

01:30:58.202 --> 01:30:59.286
(Ike) Holliday,

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.954
this ain't none of your affair.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.039
We're here to talk to Earp.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:04.124
To talk!

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:48.752
(Virgil) Morgan's dead.

01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:51.296
They killed Morgan.

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:41.721
(Wyatt) They killed my brother.

01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:44.683
They came into this town.

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.395
They came in here looking for trouble.

01:32:49.188 --> 01:32:51.189
They came in here to destroy

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:54.067
everything that we've
been trying to build together.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.658
But I'm telling you

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.286
I swear to you

01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:05.870
that my brother's death

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:08.415
is not gonna be in vain.

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:13.003
'Cause from this

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:16.673
we're gonna build a better town.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.469
We're gonna build
a better Tombstone.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.723
I swear that to you.

01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:32.397
(Applause)

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:46.536
That's all.

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:47.954
So long, Doc.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:06.806
Why the kid?

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:12.562
I guess he reminded me
of too many things.
