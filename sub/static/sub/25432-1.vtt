07:53.674 --> 07:55.709
Where does he go?

17:44.431 --> 17:48.335
I agree with your prayer,
mostly.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.370
Stay out of my head.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.739
Something in there you're
trying to hide?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.374
A secret?

17:54.441 --> 17:57.677
I wondered how long before
you would join me.

26:26.485 --> 26:31.924
Yes, you were lost, little one,
weren't you?

26:31.991 --> 26:34.861
Where is your shepherd? Hm?

26:34.927 --> 26:40.166
Where do you want to go? Hm?

28:05.718 --> 28:07.686
Think so?

28:07.754 --> 28:09.055
[ Groans ]

28:09.121 --> 28:12.091
What do you say, Moses?
[ Lamb bleats ]

28:12.158 --> 28:14.393
Will we find something
for you to drink?

28:19.231 --> 28:21.934
Come along.

32:16.368 --> 32:20.973
[ Sobs ] Is the bread
not suitable?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.579
[ Sniffs ] No bread is suitable.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.514
[ Sobs ]

32:36.955 --> 32:44.263
I live, I do not feel!

32:44.330 --> 32:47.166
I do not understand.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.699
Moses?

37:57.943 --> 38:00.512
I held you highest
in my kingdom,

38:00.579 --> 38:04.049
but you let your pride
steal your humility,

38:04.115 --> 38:07.553
like a breath that steals the
flame of a candle.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.857
You and your servants
were cast off.

49:25.563 --> 49:27.865
You would have been placed
in this situation

49:27.932 --> 49:33.204
by the lies and forked tongues
of those precious creations.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.490
Not true.

49:52.557 --> 49:55.026
Oh, yes.

49:55.093 --> 49:57.062
Soon the vultures will
pick at your body,

49:57.128 --> 50:01.199
but that is not all
you will suffer.

50:01.266 --> 50:03.268
I will bear the suffering.

50:03.334 --> 50:07.138
Your compassion will only
imprison you, Jesus.

54:06.744 --> 54:10.915
I miss him. His counsel was
always very helpful.

54:10.981 --> 54:12.750
And mine is not?

54:12.817 --> 54:18.055
You know that's not what I
meant. I cherish your
counsel greatly.

54:18.122 --> 54:20.791
Hm. Flattery.

54:22.827 --> 54:23.728
Truth.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.094
I will not interfere
with God's will.

56:37.161 --> 56:41.466
God's will. God's will. God's
will. God's will.

56:47.037 --> 56:49.173
Do not die.

57:38.122 --> 57:42.126
wandered to the wilderness,
never to be seen again.

57:42.192 --> 57:43.227
[ Breathes heavily ]

57:43.293 --> 57:46.497
Another wasted prophet.

57:47.464 --> 57:50.668
On to the next chapter of life!

57:50.735 --> 57:55.906
I am the way to life,
everlasting life.

57:55.973 --> 58:00.745
You set a poor example. You look
downtrodden and broken.

58:00.811 --> 58:04.114
If you really wanted to
experience life here,

58:04.181 --> 58:09.053
you shouldn't have put so many
restrictions on yourself.

58:09.119 --> 58:10.855
Taste life!

59:12.382 --> 59:16.053
[ Coughs ]

59:21.726 --> 59:24.795
Enough games.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:20.711
How it ends is God's doing.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:27.651
Look to the vast
kingdoms of man:

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:57.367
They worship me because I give
them what they truly want.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:04:00.604
Yours for a season.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:37.301
No, no, no!

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:44.008
You will die in the wilderness
and be forgotten by God!

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:55.119
So with that, Jesus of Nazareth,
I will leave you to die.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.323
[ Groaning ]

01:05:59.389 --> 01:05:59.990
No!

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.294
No!

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.542
[ Groans ]

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:25.301
Your faith in God is proven.
Your fast is over.

01:13:25.368 --> 01:13:30.840
Regain your strength and return.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.685
Glorious!

01:13:43.319 --> 01:13:44.954
Rest, my Lord.

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:33.162
That soon will change.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:43.640
I'm at peace with what must
happen. I am no longer afraid.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.223
Welcome back.

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.860
[ Groans ]

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:07.897
You look well.

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:12.501
And I have you to
thank for that.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.225
If ordered to do so.

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:52.962
That is not sacrifice,
that is duty.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:19:00.904
Perhaps if I were born a man, I
would think differently.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:06.242
I don't know if I could obey,
being born finite...

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:10.546
being exposed to fear.

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:17.553
Finding the courage to follow
God in spite of the fear,

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.258
that is the path to salvation.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:27.496
Believe in the Father and I, and
you will never walk alone.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:31.901
I will see you again when you
are seated at the right
hand of the Father,

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:38.207
and I will not sound the shofar
until you return in
all your glory.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.916
[ Trumpet sounds ]

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.493
[ Lamb bleats ]

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:02.932
Moses! Come here!
