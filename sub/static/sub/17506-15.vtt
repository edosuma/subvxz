00:01.891 --> 00:03.210
Welcome everyone.

00:03.335 --> 00:04.922
An happy Valentine today.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.967
You know, on a day like today,
it is so important to remember

00:08.132 --> 00:11.178
that you must love yourself
in order to truly love another.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.881
And it is also important

00:13.006 --> 00:17.685
to get a sexy eyeful of besos,
the kissing bandito!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.770
[Cheesy techno music]
He is a Latin Lothario,

00:19.936 --> 00:23.274
here to make your Valentine's
dreams come true.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.581
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> besos.

00:25.706 --> 00:29.822
Ladies, look out!
His kiss cam may find you.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.962
He's bilingual, bisensual, and.

00:32.087 --> 00:34.160
Bye-bye shirt!

00:34.326 --> 00:36.245
Pick me! Pick me!

00:36.411 --> 00:38.831
Ooh, it's getting hot in here.

00:38.997 --> 00:39.832
Very sweet.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.710
Get in here.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.797
Ah, what the heck?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.966
[Laughing]
Oh, besos.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.427
Besos!

00:51.593 --> 00:54.138
Oh, no, thank you.
No, thank you, no, thank you.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.774
No, thank you.
No, thank you!

00:55.899 --> 00:56.765
No, thank you!
No, thank you!

00:56.931 --> 00:58.100
Oh, no...

00:58.266 --> 00:59.351
Well, it looks like
the kissing bandito

00:59.517 --> 01:02.563
has found my producer,
Reagan Brinkley.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.105
And he's still going.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.817
No <i>manos,</i> besos, no <i>manos!</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:09.091
<i>Manos,</i> besos!
No <i>manos!</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:30.938
Valentine's show was white-hot.

01:31.063 --> 01:33.093
I love bringing the sexy
to mid-morning television.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.912
Oh, my God, what was that guy doing?

01:35.037 --> 01:36.882
Ugh, God, I feel like
I spent the night

01:37.007 --> 01:38.265
in the wrong Barcelona disco.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.088
Besos comes to groove.

01:40.213 --> 01:42.853
He took one look at your
buttoned-up school-marm demeanor

01:43.019 --> 01:44.271
and he knew you needed
to be grooved on.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.729
You know what?
Chris is gonna lose it.

01:45.854 --> 01:48.901
I mean, he cannot handle me
being kissed by another man.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.402
Kissed?
That was a hardcore grooving.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.530
God, I hate Valentine's day.
It's so stupid.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.782
You can't force romance on people.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.784
"Oh, it's the middle
of February, I love you!"

01:56.950 --> 01:59.152
I agree.
My girlfriends and I?

01:59.277 --> 02:01.205
We make it about us.
We go out and dance.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.890
We call ourselves "the goddesses."

02:03.015 --> 02:04.693
We make the whole night
about female empowerment

02:04.818 --> 02:06.919
and who can do the most guys.
The record's one.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.963
Believe it or not, I am really
into Valentine's this year.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.340
I'm planning a special
romantic dinner for Kevin.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.259
Look at you.
Where are you ordering from?

02:13.425 --> 02:14.593
- Ava's kitchen.
- I haven't heard of that place.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.443
It's me.
My kitchen.

02:16.568 --> 02:17.845
- I'm cooking it.
- You don't cook.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.306
- You've never cooked.
- Not true.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.475
On my mom's hangover days,
I used to make her pancakes.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.726
I'm taking this very seriously.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.979
- <i>Six</i> courses.
- Yeah.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.149
This is fun!

02:29.315 --> 02:31.277
I got the immersion blender
you asked for.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.599
Oh, and the butcher said

02:32.724 --> 02:34.488
there's no such thing
as duck-fed beef.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.869
Change of plans, Missy.

02:35.994 --> 02:38.773
I am making a little
Mexican dish called <i>chili.</i>

02:38.898 --> 02:40.578
It's got beans in it.
And jah-lop-anos.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.829
[Timer beeps]

02:41.995 --> 02:43.622
Fire!
Missy, call 911!

02:43.788 --> 02:46.217
No, Ava, it's just the oven.
I'll get it.

02:46.342 --> 02:48.720
You touch my Crescent rolls,

02:48.845 --> 02:50.629
and I will literally
punch you in the throat.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.226
I am making this meal on my own.

02:53.351 --> 02:55.896
You can shop for me,
handle all of the raw meat,

02:56.021 --> 02:57.798
clean up everything before and after,

02:57.923 --> 02:59.263
but the rest is my thing.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.807
I am in love, and I want to show it

03:01.973 --> 03:03.809
with this spicy Mexican masterpiece.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.019
Is there anything else you need?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.855
Yes, please.
Can you get me a "bowl"?

03:08.021 --> 03:11.282
Green. Blue.

03:11.407 --> 03:13.193
So how you coming
with Amy's Valentine's

03:13.359 --> 03:15.254
for her little friends
and stuff? Good?

03:15.379 --> 03:16.405
Can I see what you're writing?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.925
Be right back, baby.

03:19.050 --> 03:20.060
Ah...

03:20.185 --> 03:22.930
"Dear Cooper, happy Valentine's day

03:23.055 --> 03:24.911
to a super-fun little guy."

03:25.036 --> 03:26.832
- Aww.
- Yeah, it's just tough

03:27.261 --> 03:29.006
'cause I want to keep it platonic,

03:29.131 --> 03:31.045
but I don't want Amy
to seem like a bore, you know?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.377
Yeah...

03:32.502 --> 03:34.145
Listen, honey.
I, um...

03:34.270 --> 03:36.467
Something sort of happened
on the show today

03:36.633 --> 03:38.010
that I think you need to see.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.845
Please, just promise me
you're not going to be upset.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.353
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:42.478 --> 03:44.350
- [TV clicks on]
- No, thank you, no thank you.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.588
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no!

03:45.713 --> 03:46.769
My producer, Reagan Brinkley.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.312
I-I'm telling you,

03:48.478 --> 03:49.857
I did not enjoy that,
not one little bit.

03:49.982 --> 03:52.058
I was so incredibly embarrassed.

03:52.183 --> 03:53.942
I hope you brushed your teeth.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.061
Excuse me?

03:55.186 --> 03:56.395
I mean, this dude's running around

03:56.520 --> 03:58.197
kissing every dry,
desperate lip in the place.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.264
Poor guy.

03:59.389 --> 04:00.766
Yeah, his...
His name's besos.

04:00.891 --> 04:01.867
[Laughing]
Oh? That's funny!

04:02.191 --> 04:04.912
He kind of made a beeline
for my mouth there...

04:05.078 --> 04:05.903
- Yeah.
- And stayed there

04:06.028 --> 04:07.331
quite a while, thank you. I...

04:07.995 --> 04:09.792
You know, I think
you should it watch it again,

04:09.958 --> 04:12.920
'cause it really... it does.
It goes on and on...

04:13.086 --> 04:14.675
And on and on.
No, thank you, no, thank you!

04:14.800 --> 04:17.077
- No, thank... no...
- Ah, he's making a buck.

04:17.202 --> 04:19.176
He's like a poor man's
Chippendale, this dude, huh?

04:19.341 --> 04:22.388
The guy's tongue hit my tooth, okay?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.553
You used to be so jealous.

04:25.678 --> 04:27.054
Well, babe, I don't know.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.123
I kinda feel like I sealed the deal.

04:29.248 --> 04:31.980
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Run off with besos?

04:32.146 --> 04:34.695
All right, well...
M glad you're not upset.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.387
Honestly, I couldn't care less, babe.

04:39.391 --> 04:40.700
That's great.

04:40.825 --> 04:42.366
Happy Valentine's day.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.744
Happy Valentine's day, Ava.
This looks, uh, really good.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.329
Thank you.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.665
- Mmm.
- So do you like it?

04:49.831 --> 04:52.879
Not that I care.
I just whipped it up.

04:53.004 --> 04:54.749
Whatevs.
Bought a bowl.

04:54.874 --> 04:56.296
Oh, it's, uh, really tasty.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.381
Yay!

04:57.547 --> 04:59.174
Here... cheese.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.552
Funny story, actually.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.888
I was slicing jah-lop-anos
and I rubbed my eye.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.390
It was a mess.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.143
Missy had to help me
douche my entire face.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.602
- Oh, crazy.
- [Giggles]

05:13.590 --> 05:16.033
Kevin, are you enjoying
the meal I prepared for you,

05:16.158 --> 05:17.985
or should I just
go and [Bleep] Myself?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.904
Sorry, Ava, I just had
the worst day at work.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.171
We lost a big contract and
I had to let my assistant go,

05:23.296 --> 05:25.373
and I couldn't even
get a damn cup of coffee

05:25.498 --> 05:26.744
'cause we didn't have
any coffee filters.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.843
Well, can't you just forget about it

05:27.968 --> 05:29.621
and simply enjoy my beautiful meal?

05:29.787 --> 05:32.374
- My God, Ava, I'm trying!
- Well, try a little harder!

05:32.540 --> 05:34.648
I bought a spatula today!

05:34.773 --> 05:38.018
I pranced around that kitchen
like Doris day in my apron

05:38.143 --> 05:40.220
in one of those movies where
the husband is clearly gay

05:40.345 --> 05:42.050
and I have to pretend not to notice,

05:42.216 --> 05:44.636
- and this is all I get?
- I had an awful day!

05:44.802 --> 05:46.559
And what, am I supposed to be
moonwalking in your kitchen

05:46.684 --> 05:47.890
'cause you heated up some chili?

05:48.056 --> 05:50.517
- Look, I appreciate it, but...
- Well, not enough!

05:50.683 --> 05:52.269
Well, you don't care
about my problems enough!

05:52.435 --> 05:53.937
I made you flan!

05:54.103 --> 05:55.314
I hate flan!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.483
Everybody hates flan!

06:00.629 --> 06:02.004
You know what?
This is so much better

06:02.129 --> 06:03.671
than some crowded restaurant, right?

06:03.796 --> 06:05.324
- Yeah.
- And I love this place.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.637
I mean, you always
know what you're getting.

06:06.762 --> 06:08.970
It's never too spicy...

06:09.095 --> 06:10.538
[Mouth full]
None of the dishes...

06:10.663 --> 06:12.339
None of the dishes are great,
but they're all pretty good.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.666
Yeah, and this is
what it's all about, honey.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.003
No b.S. Dinners.
No stupid flowers.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.546
For us, every day
is Valentine's day, right?

06:20.671 --> 06:22.415
Aww.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.483
[Both laugh]

06:24.608 --> 06:25.517
[Knock at door]

06:25.642 --> 06:27.452
What's up, Kev?

06:27.577 --> 06:29.087
Ava's crazy.
She's completely nuts.

06:29.212 --> 06:31.517
- Is that, uh...
- Yeah, chili!

06:31.683 --> 06:32.768
And this is flan!

06:32.934 --> 06:34.019
Ooh, no one likes flan.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.226
We just had the biggest fight.

06:36.351 --> 06:37.561
Yelling, screaming.

06:37.686 --> 06:38.912
You know when you
care about somebody so much

06:39.037 --> 06:40.984
it's like every cell
in your body's on fire?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.131
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, that's us.

06:42.256 --> 06:44.613
We are just inside, like, smoking.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.601
I'm sorry, guys.
You're probably

06:45.726 --> 06:47.699
in the middle of
a special Valentine's...

06:48.295 --> 06:49.243
Thing.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.577
Yeah...

06:50.743 --> 06:52.074
Reagan, I need you!
I am enraged!

06:52.199 --> 06:53.705
What is he doing here?

06:53.871 --> 06:54.748
The two of you need to talk.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.208
Not until I get an apology!

06:56.374 --> 06:58.502
For what?
Me being a frickin' human being?

06:58.668 --> 06:59.415
You know what?
Shhplck!

06:59.540 --> 07:00.462
We have a baby who's sleeping.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.547
Well, guess who else
is a human being.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.841
<i>Mo</i> and human beings
need love and attention

07:04.007 --> 07:04.925
just like everybody else!

07:05.091 --> 07:06.821
I once saw a documentary on monkeys

07:06.946 --> 07:08.456
who didn't get nurtured,
and all they did

07:08.581 --> 07:09.888
was just lay there after a while!

07:10.054 --> 07:11.158
I can't help it if you need the love

07:11.283 --> 07:12.683
and attention of, like, 48 monkeys!

07:12.849 --> 07:14.017
I feel like this
is getting really private.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.477
Guys, still...
Baby is sleeping.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.104
- You make me so crazy!
- You make me crazy!

07:17.723 --> 07:20.367
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Remember what we talked about!

07:20.492 --> 07:22.150
Remember, you can only
throw food in your own home!

07:22.316 --> 07:26.136
We've talked about this.

07:26.261 --> 07:28.304
I am done with this!

07:28.429 --> 07:30.284
Lose my 212 cell phone number!

07:30.450 --> 07:32.369
Lose my AOL address!

07:32.535 --> 07:33.709
See you later.
[Door slams]

07:33.834 --> 07:35.477
Wow, I'm actually shocked
they didn't wake Amy.

07:35.602 --> 07:36.611
Yeah.

07:36.736 --> 07:38.446
[Screaming]
I bought a measuring cup!

07:38.571 --> 07:39.547
[Amy crying]

07:39.672 --> 07:41.315
Yep, there it is.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.817
I am so glad that we
are past all that drama.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.465
I mean, who wants to be
in a relationship like that?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.655
It's like everything
is, like, life or death.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.157
You know, everything
is, like, a thing.

07:49.282 --> 07:51.359
I know.

07:51.484 --> 07:53.193
You know, the great thing
about us is we still

07:53.318 --> 07:54.828
- have all the passion...
- Totally.

07:54.953 --> 07:56.226
Without all the craziness.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.186
Honey, do you want me
to get you some shorts?

07:58.352 --> 08:00.099
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

08:00.224 --> 08:02.367
- Yeah, sure.
- No, it's okay.

08:02.492 --> 08:04.236
Although...

08:04.361 --> 08:06.738
Before I pack it all back in...

08:06.863 --> 08:08.030
It is Valentine's day.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.940
[Sighs]
Yeah, you know what?

08:10.065 --> 08:11.775
Why don't you just pack it up for now

08:11.900 --> 08:13.493
and then maybe
we'll pull it out later?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.411
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.812
- Ready to go.
- Yeah.

08:16.937 --> 08:18.332
Whenever.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.666
[Sighs]

08:19.832 --> 08:21.716
We did have some craziness
back in the day, though,

08:21.841 --> 08:23.712
- didn't we?
- Oh, yeah.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.619
Remember when you punched
that girl at the bar

08:25.744 --> 08:27.049
'cause she gave me her number?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.088
[Both laugh]

08:28.213 --> 08:29.389
Yeah, she didn't think I'd do it.

08:29.514 --> 08:31.223
No.

08:31.348 --> 08:34.181
Aww, do you remember
that time that you spray-painted

08:34.347 --> 08:35.660
"Chris hearts Reagan"
on that overpass

08:35.785 --> 08:37.225
so that I would see it
on my way work?

08:37.390 --> 08:39.429
God, I almost broke my neck.
That was so stupid.

08:39.554 --> 08:40.996
- Aww, now...
- It's like I needed every guy

08:41.121 --> 08:43.690
on Sepulveda Boulevard
to know that you were mine.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.334
Yeah, and now I can
just kiss some weird guy on TV

08:46.459 --> 08:48.528
and you're, like, "high-five, besos!"

08:48.694 --> 08:51.171
You know, it's funny
that now our relationship

08:51.296 --> 08:53.200
is kinda like
our Chinese food, you know?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.375
It's tasty,
it's just not too much spice.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.544
No, really barely any spice.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.082
If you're not paying any attention,

09:00.248 --> 09:01.833
you'd think
there were no spice at all.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.947
[Both laugh]

09:04.072 --> 09:05.015
[Both sigh]

09:09.042 --> 09:11.519
- So should we, um...
- Yeah.

09:11.644 --> 09:13.345
- Yeah.
- Sure, why not?

09:13.980 --> 09:15.305
I can leave my shirt on, right?

09:15.471 --> 09:18.271
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
Let me just pop on there.

09:19.419 --> 09:20.495
That was nice, honey.

09:20.620 --> 09:21.975
What? Yeah.

09:22.141 --> 09:23.438
[Both sigh]

09:31.821 --> 09:33.991
{pub}So, about Kevin last night.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.784
Barging into your house like that?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.736
- Yeah...
- Now I'm a wreck.

09:37.861 --> 09:39.371
I didn't sleep at all
and I look a mess.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.840
- You look great.
- I know!

09:40.965 --> 09:44.501
But I can't believe I let myself
get so worked up over a guy.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.244
A guy!

09:46.369 --> 09:47.921
I mean, I am an independent woman

09:48.087 --> 09:49.448
with my own daytime talk show!

09:49.573 --> 09:50.590
I know.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.751
That man just makes my blood boil.

09:52.876 --> 09:53.927
Chris and I, I think, might have

09:54.093 --> 09:55.921
the exact opposite problem
of you two.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.957
I mean, I don't remember
the last time

09:58.082 --> 09:59.474
that he made me crazy like that.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.526
- Christopher?
- Yeah.

10:00.651 --> 10:02.310
He oozes romance.

10:02.476 --> 10:03.395
That man would
walk through fire for you.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.396
Last night, we had Pandora playing

10:05.521 --> 10:07.897
during our lovemaking
and he stopped twice

10:08.022 --> 10:10.098
- to thumbs-down Dylan songs.
- Ooh.

10:10.223 --> 10:11.862
- Ava, my darling!
- Julian?

10:12.028 --> 10:12.821
Oh, Julian.

10:13.059 --> 10:14.502
I heard about
your relationship problems.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.324
I wanted to come make sure
everything was okay.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.744
That was literally eight hours ago.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.208
- I have eyes everywhere.
- That doesn't freak me out.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.519
Ava!

10:22.644 --> 10:24.711
Let me take you to lunch
at my new supper club.

10:24.836 --> 10:26.712
It's called "bed." It is a metaphor,

10:26.837 --> 10:29.337
but don't worry,
there are actual beds.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.616
- Oh, boy.
- Stand by, Julian.

10:31.741 --> 10:33.133
Maybe this is what I need.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.686
A shallow, superficial relationship

10:34.811 --> 10:36.595
that leaves you
with no emotion whatsoever?

10:36.761 --> 10:37.929
Superficial?

10:38.095 --> 10:41.349
I love Ava for her beauty,
her clothes, and her fame!

10:41.515 --> 10:43.070
- That's tee things!
- Okay.

10:43.195 --> 10:44.019
And look at this!
[Both gasp]

10:44.185 --> 10:45.060
Oh, d, come on now!

10:45.185 --> 10:46.895
Julian, I don't think
she wants... ooh!

10:47.020 --> 10:48.315
It's literally skin deep.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.932
The Chinese symbol
for the letter "a".

10:51.057 --> 10:53.070
- "A".
- So an "a"?

10:53.236 --> 10:54.935
Yes.
Could stand for "amazing,"

10:55.060 --> 10:58.366
"Armenia," but most of all,
possibly, "Ava."

10:58.532 --> 10:59.372
"Ava."

10:59.497 --> 11:01.039
Scarring your body for your lover

11:01.164 --> 11:02.537
is the ultimate symbol of passion.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.278
[Laughing]
Julian...

11:05.403 --> 11:06.713
That's stupid.

11:06.838 --> 11:10.015
No, Julian is stupid,
but you know what?

11:10.140 --> 11:11.750
Getting a tattoo for someone...

11:11.875 --> 11:13.317
I mean, that's kind of a...

11:13.442 --> 11:15.008
A cool, romantic gesture, right?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.927
I mean, if you want to
try to spice stuff up?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.762
It's painful,
but it's not unbearable.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.790
I got a dolphin
when I was in high school.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.257
We serve dolphin in bed.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.683
- Shh.
- But you know what?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.477
I'm gonna get a tattoo for Chris.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.437
- Thank you, Julian.
- Now we kiss?

11:27.603 --> 11:28.980
- No.
- It's okay.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.664
- Julian.
- Mmm?

11:30.789 --> 11:31.733
- You are fun.
- Mmm.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.194
I will go to bed with you.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.654
Hey, dude.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.336
Thought I'd bring this back to you.

11:37.461 --> 11:40.906
Found it in the, uh,
bushes outside our house.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.073
I'm embarrassed.

11:42.198 --> 11:43.508
I mean, in the moment,
I guess I thought

11:43.633 --> 11:45.997
throwing my shoe up on the roof
would make my point.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.166
It never does.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.513
She's got me so crazy, you know?

11:49.638 --> 11:52.683
I-I can't eat, I can't sleep.

11:52.808 --> 11:53.755
Oh, God.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.132
What is it?

11:55.298 --> 11:57.555
I forgot to allow for
the lattice variation... damn it!

11:57.680 --> 11:59.845
Oh, man, that's such
a rookie, right...

12:00.011 --> 12:00.892
Mistake...?

12:01.017 --> 12:02.293
Can you hand me the hog-ring pliers?

12:02.418 --> 12:05.664
Yeah, sure!
The, uh, hoggers.

12:05.789 --> 12:08.999
Hey, you know, um, dude,
I know that, you know,

12:09.124 --> 12:10.701
this sort of
early relationship craziness

12:10.826 --> 12:12.566
that you're going through
right now is kind of awful,

12:12.732 --> 12:13.567
but it's... it's also
kind of awesome, you know.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.818
To be honest, I...

12:14.984 --> 12:17.195
- Really kind of miss it.
- I said hog ring.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.156
"Hog ring".
Yeah.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.111
I-I love Ava.

12:21.236 --> 12:22.712
It's just that...

12:22.837 --> 12:24.180
I-I don't know if I can
do this, you know?

12:24.305 --> 12:26.449
Everything's what she wants,
what she needs.

12:26.574 --> 12:29.583
S-she's incapable of meeting me
halfway, you know?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.252
Thanks, man.
You know, I just...

12:32.418 --> 12:35.338
Feel like I...
I don't know, I'd rather have

12:35.504 --> 12:36.623
what you and Reagan have, you know?

12:36.748 --> 12:38.858
Something solid and comfortable.

12:38.983 --> 12:42.928
Yeah, although I gotta say,
I wish sometimes that I would

12:43.053 --> 12:45.223
do something crazy
like throw a shoe or...

12:49.143 --> 12:51.062
Can I borrow this spray paint?

12:52.691 --> 12:55.942
Yeah, this is it.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.107
I bet you noticed
the spray paint, huh?

13:02.232 --> 13:03.950
Probably wondering,
"what's this mystery guy up to?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.877
"Something illegal?
Is he a tagger?

13:07.002 --> 13:09.546
"Is he anonymous
street artist Banksy?

13:09.671 --> 13:10.747
"Is willing to go to jail

13:10.872 --> 13:12.751
just to express
his love through graffitus..."

13:12.917 --> 13:15.253
Graffito...
Graffiti... whatever.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.787
I'll just take $2 back, please.

13:17.912 --> 13:19.549
Or a dollar's... fine.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.176
Thank you.

13:29.353 --> 13:30.863
So does the hep c
come with the tattoo

13:30.988 --> 13:32.437
or do you have to pay extra for that?

13:32.603 --> 13:33.897
[Laughs]

13:34.063 --> 13:35.167
Because...

13:35.292 --> 13:37.525
You can get hep c from a tattoo.

13:38.995 --> 13:41.972
I'm just...
I'm getting my husband's name

13:42.097 --> 13:44.157
inked on my bootay.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.110
Yeah, here we are,
just four edgy ladies

13:49.235 --> 13:50.705
getting our tattoo on.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.040
Okay, who's next?

13:52.206 --> 13:54.047
That's me.

13:54.172 --> 13:55.815
Fresh ink.

13:55.940 --> 13:57.963
Dead man walking.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.298
Look at me, getting inked!

14:00.464 --> 14:01.586
I don't want to
blow your mind or anything,

14:01.711 --> 14:05.091
but, uh, I am over 30.

14:05.216 --> 14:06.526
Yeah, I know.

14:06.651 --> 14:09.182
I know!
I know.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.533
It's just, like, genetic, I'm sure.

14:12.658 --> 14:14.235
Another thing that you
might want to hold on

14:14.360 --> 14:18.004
to your ear hoops
over there, but, uh...

14:18.129 --> 14:19.609
I have a baby.
I do.

14:19.997 --> 14:22.998
Yeah, you heard me.
I do.

14:26.202 --> 14:28.446
You ever have one of
those moments when you, like,

14:28.571 --> 14:31.682
leave your body for a second
and looking down on yourself

14:31.807 --> 14:35.834
And, what you see there is super-tragic?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.587
[Tattoo gun buzzes]
[Gasps]

14:37.712 --> 14:39.088
[Sighs]
Yeah, you know what?

14:39.213 --> 14:43.459
I'm not gonna do this tattoo today.

14:43.584 --> 14:45.260
Maybe tomorrow?
I just, uh...

14:45.426 --> 14:47.430
I forget I, um,
am late for a pap smear,

14:47.555 --> 14:49.131
so thank you very much.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.182
Take care.
Keep the deposit.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.250
Yeah, this is totally gonna work.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.997
[Shouts]
Ah, [Bleep]!

15:14.163 --> 15:16.145
[Bleep]

15:21.128 --> 15:22.683
'sup?

15:25.622 --> 15:27.737
{pub}This is an interesting place.

15:27.862 --> 15:29.463
I can't tell if it's great or awful.

15:29.588 --> 15:31.274
Thank you.
I wanted to create

15:31.399 --> 15:34.645
an eating experience that was
based totally on comfort.

15:34.770 --> 15:36.853
- Please.
- Oh.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.616
Oh!... kay.

15:38.741 --> 15:40.417
Whoops.
Waterbed.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.317
[Shouts]
Come.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.402
- Sorry.
- No problem.

15:48.416 --> 15:49.992
- It's for VIPs.
- Sure.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.077
And it's filled with vodka, hmm?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.661
- Is that I smell?
- Yes.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.872
But enough about other topics.
Let's talk more about you.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.583
Your TV show,
your boobies, your mind.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.701
[Plates clattering]

15:59.826 --> 16:01.544
- Oh, what's this?
- Italian Sushi.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.589
It's like Japanese Sushi instead
with Italian ingredients.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.675
- Oh.
- Mmm.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.510
- Ah?
- Mmm... uhh.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.513
To be the food
going down your food tube.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.445
What?

16:12.570 --> 16:13.579
You have such an instinct

16:13.704 --> 16:14.766
for the finer things in life.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.781
The way you dress, the car you drive,

16:16.906 --> 16:18.395
even your classic French timepiece.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.484
- It's a Piaget.
- Ah, yes.

16:20.609 --> 16:24.721
Julian, I'm sorry, we've been
talking about me for an hour.

16:24.846 --> 16:26.403
I'm bored. Can we
talk about something else?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.655
Understood.
I'm not a man to be told twice.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.198
Thank you.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.367
You have the most beautiful
freckle right there.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.195
- [Sighs]
- And here.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.371
- And here, and here.
- Okay.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.829
You're a freckle face.

16:37.954 --> 16:39.457
Okay, Julian.
You know what?

16:39.623 --> 16:41.563
You've actually cleared
something up for me.

16:41.688 --> 16:43.044
- Okay.
- I gotta go.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.170
- Gotta go?
- Yeah.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.299
- But...
- I just...

16:45.424 --> 16:46.423
Why you gonna go?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.466
- I can't get...
- Okay, wait, I do this.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.801
- Hold on.
- I'm dynamite!

16:49.967 --> 16:51.672
- [Plates clattering]
- All right, there we go.

16:51.797 --> 16:53.373
- Yep.
- Thank you.
