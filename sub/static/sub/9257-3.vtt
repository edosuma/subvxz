00:02.784 --> 00:04.311
Vic! Come on, dude!

00:04.769 --> 00:08.267
–Tell me you're leaving!
–That which doesn't kill me…

00:16.388 --> 00:18.778
Come on! Come on! Let go!

00:45.133 --> 00:47.108
Vic!

01:46.655 --> 01:48.380
Hi.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.348
David Aceveda.
Vote for me. Appreciate it.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.665
Hi. David Aceveda.
Vote for me.

02:28.131 --> 02:29.921
That's an arm.

02:44.968 --> 02:48.097
Went to Armadillo's place
to talk to him about Tio's murder.

02:48.137 --> 02:49.763
–What'd he say?
–He wasn't there.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.092
Signs of a struggle though.
Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.844
–Pretty ugly stuff.
–That sounds like Armadillo's MO.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.316
Checked Tio's phone records.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.830
You were the last call he made
last night on his cell before he died.

03:01.870 --> 03:04.114
Yeah. He sounded kind of agitated.

03:04.303 --> 03:06.019
–We got cut off.
–Too bad.

03:08.016 --> 03:09.739
What are you asking me?

03:09.936 --> 03:13.632
Look, I don't like these questions
any more than you do.

03:15.154 --> 03:18.411
I was with my guys all last night
while Tio was being killed.

03:18.451 --> 03:20.786
Feel free to ask 'em.

03:20.947 --> 03:22.671
Okay, then.

03:24.340 --> 03:26.122
Single blow, a heavy blade.

03:26.165 --> 03:29.515
–An ax, maybe a machete.
–How long ago?

03:29.814 --> 03:32.400
Based on core temp,
I'd say recently.

03:32.599 --> 03:37.107
–Three to four hours.
–So she's been dead since around 6:00.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.601
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting…

03:39.641 --> 03:42.413
indicate she was alive
when this happened.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.601
–Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
–Okay.

03:47.771 --> 03:50.548
If someone were trying to keep her
alive, how long could she survive?

03:50.588 --> 03:52.854
With a tourniquet and basic
medical knowledge, indefinitely.

03:52.894 --> 03:56.886
Until he tired of his domination and
control Dr Mengele experiments…

03:56.926 --> 04:00.407
and decided to squeeze the last breath
out of her so he could watch.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.711
See, this is why you and me can't date.

04:02.751 --> 04:06.014
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D now.

04:08.801 --> 04:12.195
I spoke to Shane.

04:12.228 --> 04:16.055
He said you weren't with him
for about an hour last night.

04:17.188 --> 04:18.755
Yeah. That's right.

04:18.790 --> 04:22.024
I was with a private eye
named, uh, Gordie Liman.

04:22.182 --> 04:24.446
–What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
–Nothing.

04:24.486 --> 04:26.399
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.

04:26.439 --> 04:28.799
I'm happy to help you
if you're helping me.

04:28.839 --> 04:31.230
–Are you?
–I have been.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.223
But I'm just about through.

04:33.417 --> 04:36.519
I guess I'll have to
figure this out on my own.

04:39.691 --> 04:41.869
What the hell was that all about?

04:41.996 --> 04:43.719
Nothing.

04:50.061 --> 04:52.711
Why didn't you just
leave it here and call 911?

04:52.751 --> 04:55.015
–This dog was sniffing around it.
–So?

04:55.055 --> 04:58.224
It's a bone.

04:58.257 --> 05:01.065
The arm probably fell out of the
Dumpster when the truck picked it up.

05:01.105 --> 05:04.074
Call city services. Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.

05:04.114 --> 05:06.955
The rest of her might still be
in that truck. Alive, even.

05:06.995 --> 05:08.940
Lowe, did we I.D
the fingerprints yet?

05:08.980 --> 05:11.756
–There's a backlog.
–Backlog? I cant find her if I can't I.D her.

05:11.796 --> 05:14.925
Give me that. Have your guys
do door knocks. Talk to every neighbor.

05:14.965 --> 05:17.454
Tell everyone if they find anything,
give me a call.

05:17.494 --> 05:19.414
This is Detective Wagenbach.

05:19.448 --> 05:22.615
I told you I needed
a rush on those prints.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.936
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.

05:25.976 --> 05:30.068
And if she is, I'd hate to see
your backlog cost her her life.

05:30.266 --> 05:33.427
–You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
–You were gone for an hour.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.180
Jesus! She's all over my ass
about this Tio connection.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.357
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.

05:38.397 --> 05:40.278
–Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
–You are lying to her.

05:40.318 --> 05:43.446
–What, are you trying to be a wiseass?
–No, I'm just…

05:43.486 --> 05:45.853
Just shut the hell up!

05:46.015 --> 05:47.863
–Christ!
–Where are we headed?

05:47.903 --> 05:50.456
I got things to do. I gave you guys
to Aceveda for the day.

05:50.496 --> 05:53.496
–What?
–Apparently, a group of male hustlers…

05:53.632 --> 05:57.177
is hangin' out on the same block
as Aceveda's campaign headquarters.

05:57.217 --> 05:59.771
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.

05:59.811 --> 06:03.771
–You can't be serious.
–Your shirt's gay enough for the job.

06:04.484 --> 06:07.648
–What do you mean
you gave us to Aceveda? What…

06:07.846 --> 06:11.938
Great. I've got your assignments.
Briefing room, five minutes.

06:14.631 --> 06:16.611
Is everything okay with Kayla?

06:16.617 --> 06:18.944
When was the last time
you saw your roommate?

06:18.984 --> 06:22.114
–Last night around 6:00.
–She didn't come home all night?

06:22.154 --> 06:24.513
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.

06:24.553 --> 06:26.924
Any idea where she might have gone?

06:26.957 --> 06:30.634
There's two million single men in L.A.
Take your pick.

06:31.213 --> 06:33.605
We found her car in the garage, but not her
purse or keys. Is there someone close?

06:33.645 --> 06:35.980
Somewhere she
might have walked to?

06:36.142 --> 06:39.274
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?

06:41.808 --> 06:44.521
We have every reason to believe
that she's still alive.

06:44.561 --> 06:47.147
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch…

06:47.344 --> 06:49.258
but our rent's due next week.

06:52.466 --> 06:55.250
–Vic. I got great news.
–What?

06:55.347 --> 06:59.052
Just be glad you hired me and not
the brain-dead idiot your wife did.

06:59.092 --> 07:01.515
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?

07:01.590 --> 07:05.166
Corrine's P.I., they're making
nonsecure calls from his cell phone.

07:05.206 --> 07:09.036
I caught one.
Found where she's at.

07:09.272 --> 07:12.175
–Beauty. You got the address?
–Yeah, sure.

07:14.617 --> 07:16.754
–Oh, geez.
–Corrine… Don't run away.

07:16.794 --> 07:18.834
Just hear me out
for two seconds.

07:18.874 --> 07:21.051
Look, this running has to stop.

07:21.085 --> 07:23.593
How much time
could you possibly need?

07:23.739 --> 07:26.068
This isn't about me, Vic. It's about
our kids, about them being safe.

07:26.108 --> 07:28.629
Do you honestly think
I'd put my children in danger?

07:28.669 --> 07:31.574
Not intentionally,
but the things going on in your life…

07:31.614 --> 07:33.339
Something told me to run.

07:33.535 --> 07:37.846
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.045
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.

07:42.081 --> 07:44.313
This isn't gonna
change things between us.

07:44.353 --> 07:46.558
Don't punish them
because of me.

07:47.619 --> 07:51.051
I'll move out if I have to,
if that's what it takes.

07:51.108 --> 07:55.266
But I need to know that they're
at home where they can be safe.

07:57.765 --> 08:00.999
I don't… I don't know, okay?
I'll think about it.

08:07.784 --> 08:10.497
Hey, how'd your meeting
with I.A.D go last night?

08:10.537 --> 08:12.360
Good. Good.

08:12.555 --> 08:14.469
You ran out of here so quick.

08:14.475 --> 08:17.313
They told me not
to discuss it with anyone.

08:17.452 --> 08:19.754
But it went fine.

08:24.813 --> 08:26.603
Anything yet?

08:35.825 --> 08:39.655
–Hi. I'm Detective Wagenbach.
–All right. Just a second.

08:41.682 --> 08:45.066
–Bob, the police are here.
–Police? Open it.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.670
I saw you all coming in.
What's going on?

08:50.710 --> 08:53.102
I'm investigating
your neighbor's disappearance.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.439
You hear or see anything
suspicious last night?

08:55.479 --> 08:57.934
–Which neighbor?
–Kayla LeSeur.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.913
Oh, man. We heard her arguing
last night out on the balcony.

09:00.953 --> 09:04.340
Yeah, around midnight. I saw her
through the window with a guy.

09:04.380 --> 09:08.142
–You recognize him?
–Yeah. Marcy had me come take a look.

09:08.474 --> 09:10.355
I've seen him around a few times.

09:10.395 --> 09:12.535
Come down, give a description?

09:12.668 --> 09:15.833
Uh, sure. Let me
just grab my jacket.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.785
Great.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.752
–Alvarez?
–All right. Let's take Union.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.737
Hey, how's my favorite hillbilly?

09:31.777 --> 09:33.882
Joe, what in the hell
you doin' here?

09:33.922 --> 09:36.059
I'm here to meet
the big guy for lunch.

09:36.099 --> 09:39.804
–Hey, you still crackin' skulls?
–Yeah, man. How's retirement?

09:39.844 --> 09:42.205
–I'm shavin' a few strokes off my golf game.
–You look good.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.349
–You I don't know.
–Ronnie Gardocki.

09:44.389 --> 09:47.198
Joe Clarke. Taught your boss
everything he knows.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.887
Yeah, but you didn't teach me
everything you know, right?

09:49.927 --> 09:52.383
That's right.
I'm saving some.

09:52.552 --> 09:55.852
–We're gonna grab a bite. Wanna go?
–They're busy.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.475
When I miss tee time at Riviera
for this, you better be buying.

10:01.515 --> 10:05.673
Riviera? Since when do they let
hacks like you play at Riviera?

10:08.044 --> 10:11.022
You guys still here?
Come on!

10:11.056 --> 10:13.892
Hey, who was that with Vic?

10:14.030 --> 10:17.671
–Joe Clarke, his old partner.
–They kicked him off the force.

10:17.711 --> 10:20.456
–Why is that?
–Some punk took a swing at his last partner.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.761
Joe knocked out like half
of his teeth in front of this crowd.

10:22.801 --> 10:25.769
Total railroad job.

10:25.906 --> 10:29.668
Don't worry. It's nothing like
what you're going through.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.846
So it's been a year
since you called me up.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.724
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?

10:40.278 --> 10:42.417
Can't I buy you lunch?

10:42.552 --> 10:45.552
Vic, come on.

10:46.968 --> 10:49.357
It's, uh…

10:49.529 --> 10:53.491
been a pretty rough ride lately…

10:53.530 --> 10:56.698
Enough I'm thinking about
gettin' off the train.

11:01.468 --> 11:03.382
You wanna give up your badge?

11:03.389 --> 11:07.546
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?

11:08.959 --> 11:10.741
You don't wanna give it up.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.689
–Retirement's been pretty good to you.
–A forced retirement.

11:13.729 --> 11:15.769
Believe me. I still miss it.

11:15.905 --> 11:18.545
We can hit the links
together every day.

11:20.226 --> 11:21.949
What's bothering you now?

11:28.868 --> 11:31.771
When, uh…

11:31.909 --> 11:33.819
When we were ridin'…

11:36.135 --> 11:38.112
you ever feel like
you went too far?

11:38.152 --> 11:40.520
Yeah. Couple times, maybe.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.845
Probably.

11:47.018 --> 11:48.742
Definitely.

11:48.939 --> 11:51.525
Hell, you can't always
land just right.

11:51.723 --> 11:55.076
Goin' too far will get you fired. Not
goin' far enough will get you killed.

11:55.116 --> 11:58.414
I never lost any sleep
over it though.

11:58.447 --> 12:02.474
Anyway, we always did
more good than bad, right?

12:05.296 --> 12:07.020
Right.

12:08.592 --> 12:10.316
That's the key.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.717
–Yeah. That's him, all right.
–Yeah.

12:20.757 --> 12:24.238
–Good.
–Anything else we can do?
She was such a nice girl.

12:24.278 --> 12:26.001
She still is.

12:27.318 --> 12:30.031
Roommate I.D'd the photo
as a Jordan Arnold.

12:30.071 --> 12:32.272
Run the DMV.
Get me an address now.

12:32.312 --> 12:34.035
We're running out of time.

12:35.192 --> 12:38.426
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.

12:38.459 --> 12:41.109
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.

12:41.466 --> 12:46.487
–Still, that bust was when I knew.
–Knew?

12:46.620 --> 12:50.316
That maybe you wouldn't be
a complete screwup after all.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.879
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
–No, I can't.

12:53.919 --> 12:56.279
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.

12:56.319 --> 12:59.480
Bullshit. This is your
training officer, all right?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.680
Take the afternoon off. Humor an old man.
Take a right. Come on.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.022
All right.

13:05.186 --> 13:07.936
Yes?

13:08.130 --> 13:10.638
I've got a problem
on this Tio murder.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.024
What's that?

13:13.220 --> 13:16.605
The more I look into it,
the more Vic Mackey's name pops up.

13:16.645 --> 13:20.924
Well, Tio was Vic's C.I.

13:21.094 --> 13:22.917
He was also a drug dealer.

13:23.111 --> 13:24.992
Vic's name is all over
his phone records.

13:25.032 --> 13:28.546
But Vic told me he hadn't
talked to him in months.

13:28.744 --> 13:32.574
–He lied.
–Well, what do you wanna do about it?

13:34.538 --> 13:36.132
I went through Tio's place.

13:36.172 --> 13:40.777
I found his business ledger detailing
payments made to a landlord.

13:43.052 --> 13:47.626
I wanna check them against Vic's
cash deposits in his bank accounts.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.547
I need your authorization.

13:50.735 --> 13:53.156
Claudette, Vic's one of us.

14:00.114 --> 14:02.514
I got a dead drug dealer.

14:02.548 --> 14:05.744
I got a suspect who's
probably skipped town…

14:05.875 --> 14:08.300
and the only person who
can shed some light on it…

14:08.340 --> 14:11.058
is an uncooperative cop
with a bad rep.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.684
You want me to let this case
just slip away, son?

14:18.519 --> 14:22.098
I.A.D on Danny's shooting.

14:22.297 --> 14:26.127
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.

14:27.898 --> 14:30.472
Everything looking good
for my officer?

14:35.388 --> 14:38.521
–Getting all the cooperation you need?
–Pardon?

14:38.749 --> 14:43.388
'Cause if anybody's giving you
any interference, I can help.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.045
Ah. Thanks.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.282
Claudette, witness brought in
a freshly amputated arm.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.713
I'm thinking sadomasochist,
probably keeping her alive.

14:50.753 --> 14:53.690
–I've got a suspect named Jordan Arnold.
–Let me help you with that.

14:53.730 --> 14:56.632
Thanks. I can use a sounding board.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.771
Know who lives there?

15:07.909 --> 15:10.779
Cocksucker who cost me my job.

15:10.919 --> 15:12.861
–Fleetwood.
–Yeah.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.309
City paid off the lawsuit: 1.2 mil.

15:15.368 --> 15:18.435
He moved back
just a couple months ago.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.773
–Son of a bitch.
–Hey.

15:20.938 --> 15:23.715
How'd you like to help me do some good,
serve up a little karmic justice?

15:23.755 --> 15:27.908
–Joe…
–Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him
on a felony before nightfall.

15:27.948 --> 15:30.212
These assholes could win a lottery
and still not keep their noses clean.

15:30.252 --> 15:33.445
See that little prick?
He got one over on me, man.

15:33.485 --> 15:35.878
–You know that ain't right.
–Yes, I know it's not right.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.505
–Then here we go.
–Lookee here!

15:38.703 --> 15:40.616
–Jesus Christ.
–Bitch that made me rich!

15:40.656 --> 15:43.752
You thought it'd be fun to beat on me
like a punk nigga now, huh?

15:43.792 --> 15:46.444
–Who's the nigga now?
–Hey! Step back!

15:46.641 --> 15:50.505
Yeah. Here. Go get yourself
some new gear on me.

15:50.643 --> 15:53.131
Go back to your party, burn out
whatever brain cells you got left.

15:53.171 --> 15:56.333
Come on, bitch. Hit me!
I could use another couple million.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.871
–Put the camera down.
–Come on. Show's just startin'.

16:00.566 --> 16:02.672
Hey, let go of him!
Let go!

16:02.806 --> 16:05.679
–Back off!
–That's all right. I'll just buy me a new one.

16:05.719 --> 16:08.110
Hey, what's this?

16:08.280 --> 16:11.347
That's a Palm. Keep it.
Got ten more on order.

16:11.481 --> 16:15.857
Why don't you
crawl on back to your crib?

16:18.075 --> 16:21.720
Hey, you need a beer,
keg's always on tap.

16:24.605 --> 16:27.834
Yeah. This ain't right.

16:41.410 --> 16:42.690
What's the verdict?

16:42.724 --> 16:46.024
Well, other than a few hiccups,
it's looking good.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.131
What hiccups?

16:48.165 --> 16:51.357
According to Julien's statement,
he didn't see the shooting.

16:51.397 --> 16:53.311
What do you mean?
He was right there!

16:53.351 --> 16:55.325
He says he was
in the woman's apartment.

16:55.365 --> 16:58.749
But I wouldn't
worry about it though.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.700
It's gonna be a good shoot.

17:12.779 --> 17:15.108
–Dutch.
–Jordan's alibi checked out.

17:15.148 --> 17:17.957
I ran a records check on
everyone in Kayla's building.

17:17.997 --> 17:21.672
–Any hits?
–Two: a woman passing bad checks
and a Bob Lindhoff.

17:21.712 --> 17:24.286
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.

17:24.301 --> 17:28.394
Nine years ago, an attempted
kidnapping charge, later dropped.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.856
She's coming to again. Get in the car.

17:58.425 --> 18:03.642
Hey! Hey, I tried to call,
but there was no answer.

18:04.027 --> 18:05.874
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?

18:05.914 --> 18:08.212
I've got a suspect down at the station
I was hoping you could I.D.

18:08.252 --> 18:09.975
You mind coming back?

18:11.068 --> 18:14.484
–Uh, is it really necessary?
–Yeah, do you mind?

18:14.973 --> 18:17.527
–No, not at all.
–Great. Follow me.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.465
Hey. Fleetwood's been checkin' in
with his parole officer…

18:25.505 --> 18:27.801
doin' community service
and scrubbin' graffiti.

18:27.841 --> 18:31.138
Sumbitch is totally clean. You?

18:31.298 --> 18:34.532
I ran some of the names
he had in his Palm Pilot.

18:34.627 --> 18:37.052
He had four two-strikers
in his address book.

18:37.092 --> 18:39.165
You need a new C.I.?

18:39.301 --> 18:41.215
–Doesn't everyone?
–I'm gonna hit the head.

18:41.255 --> 18:43.961
Then we can go do
some arm twistin', huh?

18:50.248 --> 18:52.550
–Vic, we need to talk.
–What's up?

18:52.713 --> 18:54.627
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.122
He was supposed to burn that.

18:57.354 --> 19:00.588
Well, apparently,
Armadillo burned him first.

19:00.621 --> 19:02.852
Claudette wants to run
your financials against Tio's records.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.649
Fine. Let her.

19:04.813 --> 19:08.245
–You sure?
–Trust me. She's not gonna find anything.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.321
–What's Joe Clarke doing here?
–You know Joe?

19:13.361 --> 19:17.190
I remember his picture
in the papers. He can't be here.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.201
Hey, he's a friend of mine.

19:20.433 --> 19:22.857
And he's also an embarrassment
to this department.

19:22.897 --> 19:24.778
So unless he's here
to report a crime…

19:24.818 --> 19:27.240
I can't allow him
in this building.

19:29.556 --> 19:32.208
I don't know.
Makes you think.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.765
Vic says the guy was
a real crackerjack cop.

19:34.805 --> 19:37.070
Somebody like him can get booted,
man, none of us are safe.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.439
Come on. The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.424
–Nothing's gonna happen to us.
–How are you so sure?

19:41.464 --> 19:45.807
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.181
Stupid, huh?

19:48.313 --> 19:51.090
–Vic, I…
–What's stupid is Joe's
twice the cop you'll ever be.

19:51.130 --> 19:53.401
You're too sloppy
to even know it.

19:53.564 --> 19:56.215
–Here we go again.
–I guess so.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.932
You know, I'm gettin'
a little tired of this bullshit.

19:58.972 --> 20:01.846
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having
to clean up after your bullshit!

20:01.886 --> 20:04.183
Every time something goes to shit in
your life, I become your whipping boy.

20:04.223 --> 20:06.038
Why don't you find someone else?

20:06.078 --> 20:08.535
–Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
–You want my transfer request?

20:08.575 --> 20:12.312
Say the word, Vic! It'll be on Aceveda's
desk first thing in the morning!

20:12.352 --> 20:14.109
–Fine. Write it up.
–Fine!

20:14.305 --> 20:16.509
Asshole.

20:16.641 --> 20:20.385
–What'd you call me?
–Hey, hey! Everything all right?

20:20.579 --> 20:22.876
Yeah. Just a little spring cleaning.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.705
Let's ride.

20:45.290 --> 20:48.524
I thought this was about
I.D'ing somebody.

20:48.557 --> 20:51.043
Actually, we're more interested
in the kidnapping charge…

20:51.083 --> 20:53.393
that was filed
against you in 1993.

20:55.309 --> 20:57.798
That was a misunderstanding.

20:57.999 --> 21:00.771
–You were 35 at the time, right?
–Correct.

21:00.783 --> 21:04.330
–And your girlfriend was in high school?
–She was 18.

21:04.527 --> 21:07.721
And you took her away on vacation for
two weeks and never told her parents.

21:07.761 --> 21:12.945
I know. In hindsight,
it was just a bad judgment call.

21:13.107 --> 21:14.896
But Amanda was an adult.

21:15.091 --> 21:18.026
You're 17 years older
than Marcy too.

21:18.165 --> 21:20.074
You like 'em young, Bob?

21:20.212 --> 21:23.562
Yeah. They just…
feel right.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.457
Did Kayla feel right?

21:25.654 --> 21:28.819
I wouldn't know.

21:28.951 --> 21:31.504
–I know how you feel.
–Excuse me?

21:32.888 --> 21:34.612
What'd your partner do?

21:34.809 --> 21:37.383
He's not backing me up
on the shooting.

21:37.466 --> 21:42.705
–If that guy costs me a promotion…
–He's not backing you up?

21:42.876 --> 21:46.196
–After all I've covered for him.
–You covered for him?

21:46.236 --> 21:49.586
–What did he do?
–Nothin'.

21:49.758 --> 21:53.370
Hey, it's cool.
You can tell me.

21:53.599 --> 21:56.983
No. It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.

22:03.586 --> 22:06.811
Seeing the way you stiffed your partner,
I figure you're just one big hard-on today.

22:06.851 --> 22:10.943
–Excuse me?
–You know what
an officer-involved shooting means?

22:11.140 --> 22:13.245
It means that we're all involved.

22:13.285 --> 22:17.792
–I told the truth.
–When it comes to your partner's career…

22:17.990 --> 22:19.813
the truth is like grits.

22:19.879 --> 22:23.007
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.

22:23.047 --> 22:25.732
You goddamn rookies.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.513
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.

22:28.553 --> 22:31.458
That's real… That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.

22:31.498 --> 22:34.050
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with…

22:34.090 --> 22:36.965
Drop the clothes, ladies.
Although, you have got to have that one.

22:37.005 --> 22:39.333
–She's keeping that one for free.
–Wait… Whoa!

22:39.373 --> 22:41.766
–I got receipts for all this, man!
–Oh, yeah? That's funny.

22:41.806 --> 22:44.229
I got a police report for it
from Dress For Less.

22:44.269 --> 22:46.086
Dealin' stolen merchandise,
Taylor.

22:46.126 --> 22:49.063
That's your third strike…
before you're 25 years old.

22:49.103 --> 22:51.498
That makes you the goddamn
rookie of the year.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.313
I got a little baby at home.
She need milk and books, man.

22:54.353 --> 22:56.135
Only thing you got at home…

22:56.306 --> 22:59.276
is a wide-screen TV
you haven't paid for yet!

23:00.819 --> 23:04.016
–Ow!
–Here's your statement. Sign it.

23:08.021 --> 23:10.383
Whoa, man. What the hell is this, man?
This is all filled out.

23:10.423 --> 23:14.223
You don't wanna sign? I'll throw you in
County right now on that third strike.

23:14.263 --> 23:17.784
And if I sign this
bullshit confession?

23:17.817 --> 23:19.921
Play ball with us,
we'll let you play extra innings.

23:19.961 --> 23:22.194
We know you've been selling
stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.522
Give us a hand, we'll lose this
statement. We'll forget we ever saw you.

23:25.562 --> 23:27.897
Man!

23:34.236 --> 23:36.277
Oh, my God.

23:36.413 --> 23:38.902
Why would someone
do this to her?

23:39.102 --> 23:44.538
Most likely trying to fill
a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.

23:46.304 --> 23:50.042
Why would someone fantasize
about cutting a woman's arm off?

23:50.082 --> 23:51.771
Some people derive
sexual pleasure…

23:51.811 --> 23:55.969
through inflicting
physical, emotional abuse.

23:56.356 --> 23:58.079
That's horrible.

24:00.197 --> 24:02.751
Yes, it is.

24:02.949 --> 24:04.830
How old were you
when you met Bob?

24:04.870 --> 24:09.727
–Is he your first boyfriend?
–How did you know?

24:09.863 --> 24:13.028
He made you
feel powerful, right?

24:15.785 --> 24:20.066
Did he tell you about the attempted
kidnapping charges filed against him?

24:20.106 --> 24:22.889
Yes. Why?

24:23.083 --> 24:25.476
Bob went to medical school
for two years.

24:25.516 --> 24:27.818
So?

24:27.980 --> 24:29.997
So…

24:30.031 --> 24:34.342
So if a woman had her arm cut off,
he'd know how to keep her alive.

24:34.382 --> 24:36.936
Oh, God, no.

24:37.007 --> 24:41.351
No. I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.794
What'd we get back on the river basins
and the state parks check?

24:46.834 --> 24:48.715
Nothing. We're still waiting
for regional and county.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.381
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.

24:50.421 --> 24:53.933
Bob's cold, manipulative. Always been
with women he could control.

24:53.973 --> 24:56.333
Marcy accepts this
'cause she knows no better.

24:56.373 --> 24:59.406
She's been force-fed his opinions to the
point she's incapable of having her own.

24:59.446 --> 25:01.711
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.792
Believe me, if you'd grown up
in my family for 20 years…

25:03.832 --> 25:05.712
you'd recognize it
right away too.

25:05.752 --> 25:10.096
I'm gonna, uh,
go it on my own on this.

25:10.265 --> 25:12.497
Marcy only knows how to
take orders from men like Bob.

25:12.537 --> 25:14.994
I-I can handle this.

25:18.396 --> 25:21.527
Bob is innocent.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.029
I understand.
You're afraid of him.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.294
–I'm not afraid of him.
–It's okay.

25:26.334 --> 25:28.855
I can protect you, but only
if you tell me what he's doing.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.640
–He's not doing anything.
–Don't lie to me, Marcy!

25:31.680 --> 25:34.015
–I'm not lying!
–Yes, you are!

25:34.176 --> 25:38.433
Bob tells you how to think,
how to feel, how to act.

25:38.594 --> 25:40.954
–Without him, you're worthless. Nothing.
–It's not like that!

25:40.994 --> 25:44.508
And you won't leave him because you're
afraid no one else will ever love you…

25:44.548 --> 25:46.653
that you'll learn Bob
was right about you all along.

25:46.693 --> 25:48.930
–No!
–Oh, damn it, Marcy!

25:49.093 --> 25:50.942
–Don't lie to me!
–Why are you doing this?

25:50.982 --> 25:53.983
Because there's a girl out there
who may still be alive…

25:54.023 --> 25:56.357
and I won't let you kill her!

25:56.552 --> 26:01.375
Now, goddamn it!
Tell me right now! Where is she?

26:01.512 --> 26:03.902
I don't know!

26:04.073 --> 26:07.336
Really! I don't!

26:12.812 --> 26:15.683
I played the daddy.
I broke her.

26:15.916 --> 26:18.661
If she knew Bob was involved,
she would've confessed…

26:18.701 --> 26:21.036
or at least given me
a nondenial.

26:21.199 --> 26:23.534
–You think?
–I don't know.

26:23.599 --> 26:26.767
Maybe Bob's not
a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.881
Maybe he's just an asshole.

26:28.915 --> 26:32.177
Problem is, he's the only
asshole we've got.

26:45.974 --> 26:48.815
–Well, what do you got for me?
–What you got for me?

26:48.855 --> 26:51.311
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.

26:53.016 --> 26:55.288
Fleetwood is fencin' again.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.071
He's so goddamn predictable.

26:58.650 --> 27:02.227
–What's he movin'?
–Just, you know, warehouse electronics, man.

27:02.267 --> 27:05.267
CDs, TVs, DVDs.
Same stuff as before.

27:05.403 --> 27:07.612
Where's he keeping his stash?

27:07.646 --> 27:11.477
Are you gonna hold this third strike
over me for the rest of my life?

27:11.517 --> 27:16.055
I could lie to you, but I have far too
much respect for you as a person.

27:16.095 --> 27:17.819
Yes, I am.

27:22.049 --> 27:26.106
Here is your authorization to check
Mackey's financial records.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.667
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.

27:28.866 --> 27:31.453
I just hope
you find the truth.

27:42.631 --> 27:44.541
Hey, Joe. It's Vic.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.010
Can you believe
I walked out on them?

27:59.147 --> 28:01.853
When they left,
I thought it'd be easier.

28:01.964 --> 28:07.112
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd
miss them. Guess I'm the shithead, huh?

28:08.398 --> 28:12.972
–Stacy still on the swim team?
–Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.361
Yeah, she, uh…
Damn it!

28:16.497 --> 28:18.378
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

28:18.418 --> 28:21.801
–Broke, with nothing.
–What about your pension?

28:21.970 --> 28:24.043
Damn lawyers for
the civil suit ate it up.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.917
–What about the stuff
you took on the side?
–I guess I didn't take enough.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.797
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.

28:30.837 --> 28:33.645
–Joe, you can't live like this.
–Oh, sure I can.

28:33.685 --> 28:35.951
The truth is, the people we save
from the worst day of their lives…

28:35.991 --> 28:38.289
never gotta see us
when we have to face ours.

28:38.329 --> 28:41.940
Hell, and why should they?
We took the job, not them.

28:42.361 --> 28:44.562
–No, that's not right.
–What you gonna do, man?

28:44.602 --> 28:46.482
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

28:46.522 --> 28:50.266
–Fleetwood's got a warehouse
full of stolen merch.
–No.

28:50.363 --> 28:53.910
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.

28:54.204 --> 28:57.812
–We get you some new digs.
–I can't let you do that, all right?

28:57.852 --> 29:01.018
Hey, I'm just… I'm just
trying to do some good.

29:01.150 --> 29:04.446
You know, and deliver
some karmic justice.

29:04.607 --> 29:06.713
Now are you in,
or are you out?

29:23.973 --> 29:26.462
Easy. Don't suck
on his tailpipe.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.142
One second.

29:35.337 --> 29:37.410
–Yeah.
–It's me.

29:37.545 --> 29:39.913
–Where are you?
–Home.

29:39.947 --> 29:42.658
–What, our home?
–Yeah. The keys still work.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.212
–Are the kids with you?
–Yeah. We're all here.

29:46.475 --> 29:48.134
Oh, thank you.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.692
–This doesn't change things.
–I know.

29:50.732 --> 29:54.149
–When can I see them?
–Now?

29:54.317 --> 29:58.013
I got to finish up somethin' first.
I'll be right there.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.804
–Okay.
–Okay.

30:05.297 --> 30:07.475
Looks like he's making a deposit.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.994
Yeah, you gotta love good intel.

30:10.195 --> 30:12.399
Stay here.
Watch my back.

30:25.464 --> 30:29.076
This is for my boy down the street.

30:29.336 --> 30:31.761
Fully automatic. You know
what I get for those on the street?

30:31.801 --> 30:35.348
Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!
Fingers interlaced!

30:35.546 --> 30:38.808
Palms on the back
of your head. Now, asshole!

30:42.524 --> 30:44.966
Come on, man! Let's move! Let's move!

30:52.191 --> 30:54.199
–Vic!
–Stay back!

31:13.093 --> 31:17.469
–Vic! You been hit?
–I'm all right. Get out of here.

31:17.639 --> 31:19.711
–I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
–Just get out of here.

31:19.751 --> 31:21.759
–No, no, I'm not ditching you, man.
–You're not ditching me.

31:21.799 --> 31:23.713
I can't explain
you being here to Aceveda.

31:23.753 --> 31:27.748
Now, go! Just call an ambulance
and call my family!

31:27.882 --> 31:30.151
I'm gonna kill
that sumbitch!

31:32.267 --> 31:34.471
No. No. Don't.

31:47.663 --> 31:49.965
Goddamn it!

31:57.426 --> 32:00.810
Christ. I hate playing this with you.

32:00.980 --> 32:03.599
This game's sucking.

32:03.796 --> 32:06.481
–You could stop.
–Shut up.

32:06.677 --> 32:10.256
It's Vic.

32:10.455 --> 32:12.179
Hey, what's up, boss?

32:15.448 --> 32:17.554
Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?

32:17.688 --> 32:20.559
–What?
–Vic got shot.

32:20.698 --> 32:22.356
–What?
–Vic got shot.

32:25.274 --> 32:28.571
–Can we leave?
–Shouldn't be much longer.

32:28.732 --> 32:30.456
Oh, please.

32:30.653 --> 32:32.825
Don't walk out on me again.

32:35.133 --> 32:37.851
Just please don't leave me alone.

32:41.632 --> 32:44.797
Look, um…

32:44.961 --> 32:46.685
I believe you.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.817
Maybe Bob did this
without you knowing.

32:52.195 --> 32:54.684
I was with him all night.

32:54.851 --> 32:58.781
If I thought he did this,
I would tell you. I would.

33:01.861 --> 33:04.131
I know you would.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.499
–Who did this to you?
–Fleetwood.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.794
That prick that got Joe
kicked off the force?

33:13.834 --> 33:16.194
Yeah. Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.

33:16.234 --> 33:18.339
Okay.

33:18.475 --> 33:20.264
You gotta stop him.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.724
–Come on, guys. We're losing blood.
–Just hang in there.

33:22.764 --> 33:24.810
–Gotta go.
–Just hang in there.

33:28.749 --> 33:30.375
Detective Wyms,
Carlson just called.

33:30.415 --> 33:32.871
There's a homeless guy with a bloody
machete saying he killed somebody.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.498
–Where?
–Just south of Bell on Vine.

33:35.696 --> 33:38.697
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?

33:38.737 --> 33:41.449
I don't know. Maybe he's checking
in on Vic. Have you heard anything?

33:41.489 --> 33:44.654
Not yet. Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.

33:47.987 --> 33:50.561
Excuse me. Excuse me.
They got the guy?

33:50.612 --> 33:53.549
–Sir, put the knife down, please.
–I'll kill again!

33:53.589 --> 33:55.821
–Drop your weapon!
–I killed them all!

33:55.861 --> 33:58.994
J.F.K, R.F.K, M.L.K.

33:59.126 --> 34:01.935
–Carlson, got bean bags?
–Locked and loaded.

34:01.975 --> 34:03.220
Run DMC.!

34:03.416 --> 34:05.198
That's the guy?
He's a nut.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.018
–I was told he had a bloody machete.
–I called in a kitchen knife.

34:08.058 --> 34:10.353
–Oh, for Christ's sakes.
–I was told to call if I found anything.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.078
End this!
Come on.

34:13.147 --> 34:16.726
–Oh, my God!
–Just a bean bag, ma'am.

34:17.052 --> 34:20.373
–Let's get back to Bob and Marcy.
–I released them.

34:20.413 --> 34:23.730
–You what?
–I thought we had the guy here.

34:23.774 --> 34:27.867
Bob didn't do it.
Marcy would've told me.

34:28.063 --> 34:31.098
Stay still for me, sir. That's it.

34:31.264 --> 34:34.202
–I'm his boss. How is he?
–He's gonna live, but we need him in surgery.

34:34.242 --> 34:37.018
–Not until I see my kids.
–Vic, don't be stupid.

34:37.058 --> 34:39.963
They're on their way here.
They're gonna be here any second.

34:40.003 --> 34:41.306
–Vic.
–Where are they?

34:41.347 --> 34:43.610
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.

34:43.650 --> 34:46.422
–I won't let you. Not like this.
–Corrine…

34:46.532 --> 34:50.527
–I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.

34:51.942 --> 34:52.706
Vic.

34:54.407 --> 34:56.382
Daddy!

34:56.520 --> 34:59.204
–Hi.
–Daddy.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.112
I missed you so much.

35:03.306 --> 35:05.030
Kiss.

35:05.227 --> 35:06.951
Hey, Matty.

35:07.147 --> 35:10.465
Give Daddy a kiss.

35:10.636 --> 35:13.387
Hey, Vic, I really
need you in here now.

35:13.581 --> 35:17.029
–Dad, don't go again.
–Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I have to.

35:17.069 --> 35:19.175
Listen, someone was
hurt really bad…

35:19.215 --> 35:21.031
and I have to stay here
until he feels better.

35:21.071 --> 35:25.768
But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come
and see you again, okay? I promise.

35:25.808 --> 35:27.631
I love you.

35:58.522 --> 36:01.109
–Where is he?
–Who?

36:01.307 --> 36:05.429
Fleetwood. You're packing his goddamn
suitcase. Now, where is he?

36:05.469 --> 36:07.977
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?

36:07.998 --> 36:10.038
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.

36:10.078 --> 36:12.855
–Hey, where is he? Where is he?
–What are you gonna do, hit me?

36:12.895 --> 36:16.248
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah? Let my bruises do the talking.

36:16.288 --> 36:19.129
Don't make me do something
that we both don't want me to do.

36:19.169 --> 36:22.486
–Yeah? Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!

36:22.978 --> 36:26.146
Please. Just tell me where he is.

36:26.179 --> 36:30.236
Go ahead and whack me, you cracker
prick. I'll make my own million.

36:30.276 --> 36:31.708
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.

36:31.748 --> 36:34.946
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.

36:35.078 --> 36:38.510
–All right, let's go. Let's go.
–What? What are you…

36:41.383 --> 36:45.607
–Come here!
–No! Let go of me!

36:45.768 --> 36:47.493
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!

36:47.530 --> 36:51.844
You and me, we're about to get real
acquainted if you don't start remembering.

36:51.884 --> 36:54.950
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?

36:55.085 --> 36:57.354
–Open up!
–Let go of me!

36:57.518 --> 36:59.885
You don't wanna tell me?

37:00.046 --> 37:03.014
–Damn it! Open the door!
–Just let go of me!

37:03.150 --> 37:08.073
Well, maybe I should just let my dick
do the talking. How about that, huh?

37:08.209 --> 37:10.123
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!

37:10.161 --> 37:12.331
–Shane, come on!
–Where is he? Where is he?

37:12.371 --> 37:15.339
He told me to meet him
at the stash house.

37:15.475 --> 37:18.477
–Where?
–Open up! Come on!

37:18.613 --> 37:20.555
Near the bridge.

37:25.391 --> 37:28.264
You have no idea
what you just missed, darlin'.

37:28.304 --> 37:30.761
–Come on!
–Asshole!

37:43.796 --> 37:47.888
Couldn't split town before you
picked up the merchandise, huh?

37:48.118 --> 37:50.479
You were always
such an idiot, Fleetwood.

37:50.519 --> 37:52.493
Weren't you?

37:52.630 --> 37:57.040
–You can't arrest me.
–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole.

38:14.109 --> 38:17.014
–Drop it! Put that on the ground!
–You heard him, asshole!

38:17.054 --> 38:20.471
Now! Turn around!
Turn around!

38:23.712 --> 38:25.592
Your girlfriend gave you up, man.

38:25.632 --> 38:28.154
She couldn't resist my charms.

38:29.217 --> 38:32.480
–You found something?
–Yeah. Over here.

38:32.675 --> 38:36.239
While I was checking
the bathroom, this tile fell off.

38:37.701 --> 38:40.833
It looks directly into
Kayla's bathroom.

38:44.486 --> 38:48.830
Oh, God. Oh, God. We got
to get an A.P.B out on their car.

38:51.389 --> 38:54.870
Jesus.

38:55.069 --> 38:59.162
–You okay?
–Better than you.

39:06.657 --> 39:09.561
Looks like I taught you
my last lesson, huh?

39:11.203 --> 39:13.374
Don't end up like me.

39:20.485 --> 39:24.545
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

39:24.647 --> 39:28.292
Going after that guy
was the right thing to do.

39:30.888 --> 39:35.106
–Hell, I got you shot.
–I always knew there was
a bullet with my name on it.

39:35.146 --> 39:39.850
And guess what?
I'm still here.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.583
So are you.

39:49.421 --> 39:53.099
Hey, you really ought
to get in there and see him.

39:53.263 --> 39:56.580
Yeah. Me and Vic aren't
really talkin' right now.

39:57.072 --> 39:58.795
He'd want to see you.

39:58.993 --> 40:02.288
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.165
Hey, what the hell
is going on?

40:13.205 --> 40:15.093
We found the peephole, Bob.

40:15.127 --> 40:19.087
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!

40:20.631 --> 40:24.561
–It's clean.
–Pop it.

40:43.678 --> 40:46.297
She's dead.

40:46.495 --> 40:49.725
She didn't like the way
I looked at Kayla.

40:49.888 --> 40:53.205
And the arm was her idea.

40:53.377 --> 40:56.312
She was in the trunk…
the whole time?

40:57.986 --> 41:01.697
Marcy, why didn't you tell me?

41:01.891 --> 41:03.614
Marcy.

41:05.221 --> 41:06.945
Sorry, Daddy.

41:26.955 --> 41:28.679
Oh, Shane.

41:28.876 --> 41:32.259
–Hey.
–When we retire…

41:32.428 --> 41:36.390
we're gonna play golf
together every day.

41:36.526 --> 41:39.079
I never played golf.

41:41.870 --> 41:43.595
I'll teach you.

41:45.104 --> 41:47.341
I'd really like that.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
