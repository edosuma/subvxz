WEBVTT

00:01.922 --> 00:03.355
Mommy's not taking us again today.

00:03.639 --> 00:04.760
Look around. Do you see Mommy?

00:04.995 --> 00:06.656
I don't mind working as a human lie detector,

00:07.667 --> 00:09.842
but it's been four nights in a row now,

00:10.001 --> 00:11.968
and frankly, my family is starting to lose it.

00:12.343 --> 00:13.099
We just got a call.

00:13.706 --> 00:14.668
Apparently, he struck again.

00:15.879 --> 00:16.731
He takes their hearts.

00:17.869 --> 00:19.413
Carves it right out of their chest.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.391
Doesn't have anything to do with sex.

00:23.872 --> 00:24.721
It's biblical.

00:25.950 --> 00:29.254
They called an ambulance for Mr. Push sometime after 3:00 this morning.

00:29.883 --> 00:31.759
You came to visit me in my bedroom.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.344
It was around 3:30 in the morning.

00:33.478 --> 00:34.479
I thought that I was dreaming.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.846
Alison, they're related.

00:37.367 --> 00:38.957
You must have died for a minute or two.

00:40.481 --> 00:40.985
What's related?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.131
The murders, the victims,

00:42.357 --> 00:43.104
the ones he chooses.

00:44.022 --> 00:44.549
It's not random.

00:45.153 --> 00:48.812
According to their DNA markers, both women have the same father.

00:49.149 --> 00:49.905
Look what Daddy brought.

00:53.890 --> 00:55.061
I'm uncorking that at 9:15.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.017
Shall we synchronize our watches?

00:57.731 --> 00:58.246
Just go.

01:02.494 --> 01:04.116
I want you to forget about all this.

01:05.703 --> 01:08.028
I want you to concentrate on getting better.

01:12.204 --> 01:12.829
Sorry I'm late.

01:15.294 --> 01:16.763
So, how did it go with the kids?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074

01:34.212 --> 01:34.669
Hello?

01:35.466 --> 01:38.041
Alison? Ken Push.

01:38.931 --> 01:39.632
Let's get some rest.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.604
And I'll see you soon, okay?

01:43.688 --> 01:45.778
Not if I don't see you first...

01:47.377 --> 01:47.890
okay?

01:49.644 --> 01:50.068
Okay.

01:51.037 --> 01:51.261
Bye.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.979
"Prepare slaughter for his children

02:13.995 --> 02:15.809
"for the iniquity of their fathers,

02:16.904 --> 02:19.880
"that they do not rise, nor possess the land,

02:20.601 --> 02:22.901
nor fill the face of the world with cities."

02:23.645 --> 02:25.446
Isaiah, Book 23,

02:26.511 --> 02:29.199
Chapter 14, Verse 21.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.556
He's baaaaack.

02:36.105 --> 02:36.834
He's broke.

02:39.411 --> 02:39.978
Do I have to?

02:40.224 --> 02:41.675
Don't you have ten of these on file already?

02:42.932 --> 02:43.542
Well, just sign it.

02:43.728 --> 02:44.791
I'll fill out the rest.

02:46.943 --> 02:48.104
You want a dirty magazine?

02:49.132 --> 02:50.894
Uh, actually...

02:53.013 --> 02:53.709
I want you.

02:56.955 --> 02:58.218
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm going to lose my job.

02:58.694 --> 02:59.182
No, you won't.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.393
You're helping to make some poor, childless couple happy.

03:03.348 --> 03:04.499
No one could fire you for that.

03:17.699 --> 03:20.384
Well, if you're just going to sit there,
you better hand me one of those magazines.

03:24.382 --> 03:24.775
Okay.

03:33.569 --> 03:34.177
But no touching.

04:42.368 --> 04:43.415
- Hi.|- Hey.

04:45.092 --> 04:45.608
Any dreams?

04:47.527 --> 04:48.409
Hmm-mm.

04:49.377 --> 04:50.659
So, you ready for what's next?

04:54.670 --> 04:55.439
That's the spirit.

04:56.037 --> 04:56.768
But I don't understand.

04:56.961 --> 04:58.539
You didn't go to France to make it,

04:59.015 --> 05:00.722
so why do they call it French toast?

05:01.224 --> 05:03.209
They didn't go to France to get French fries, either.

05:03.909 --> 05:04.221
Idiot.

05:04.860 --> 05:05.423
- Hi.|- Hey.

05:07.399 --> 05:08.732
Uh-uh. What kind of talk is that on the first day of school?

05:09.354 --> 05:10.526
Sixth graders do not call people idiots.

05:11.822 --> 05:14.719
French toast, French fries, French vanilla ice cream--

05:14.959 --> 05:16.000
they were all invented in France.

05:16.230 --> 05:18.101
The original recipes came from France.

05:21.590 --> 05:22.778
What about French kissing?

05:23.507 --> 05:25.572
Oh, that-- uh, that was invented here.

05:26.110 --> 05:26.464
By me.

05:39.496 --> 05:40.167
All right, so I'm out of here.

05:40.433 --> 05:41.629
- You got school covered?
- Yes, I do.

05:41.885 --> 05:42.968
Dropping off, picking up--

05:43.163 --> 05:44.163
covered, covered, covered.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.724
And we're going shopping for school supplies.

05:48.835 --> 05:50.066
Okay, you know I got that thing at 5:00, right?

05:50.219 --> 05:51.427
Thing at 5:00. School supplies.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.735
7:00, dinner.

05:54.237 --> 05:54.979
Done.

05:58.631 --> 05:59.299
It's  not personal, you know.

05:59.962 --> 06:00.539
I know.

06:01.124 --> 06:03.588
Believe me, no one wants to put you back to work more than I do.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.328
In fact, I'd gladly go out and kill someone myself

06:06.521 --> 06:07.601
if I thought I could get away with it.

06:08.218 --> 06:11.819
But right now, thankfully, Phoenix is quiet.

06:12.692 --> 06:13.824
You want to go through the cold case files?

06:14.312 --> 06:15.899
That's probably good for a day's pay.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.219
I did that last week.

06:18.206 --> 06:19.511
So, anything new on the Phantom?

06:20.276 --> 06:22.849
Allison, what "new" are you expecting?

06:25.817 --> 06:26.318
Look...

06:27.810 --> 06:28.988
I'm as frustrated as you are.

06:30.482 --> 06:31.959
Once we figured out that the victims were related

06:32.317 --> 06:34.469
because their father was the same anonymous sperm donor,

06:34.696 --> 06:36.360
I thought we were 70% of the way there.

06:37.219 --> 06:40.035
Unfortunately, all the sperm donations were made in the '80s,

06:40.439 --> 06:42.176
and both facilities both here and in Texas,

06:42.513 --> 06:43.440
are long since out of business.

06:44.295 --> 06:45.902
But there have to be records for health reasons.

06:46.311 --> 06:46.688
Oh, there are.

06:47.645 --> 06:48.097
We think.

06:48.794 --> 06:49.198
We hope.

06:50.669 --> 06:53.538
The FBI assures me that there are agents poring through bankruptcy court

06:53.657 --> 06:57.615
filings in both states trying to unearth the location of any relevant medical archives.

06:58.372 --> 07:00.007
The good news is whoever he is,

07:00.381 --> 07:01.414
whatever he wanted, it...

07:02.121 --> 07:02.986
seems to be over.

07:03.633 --> 07:04.476
It seems to have stopped.

07:05.206 --> 07:06.258
It happened just like he said it would.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.017
What did Captain Push call it--

07:08.708 --> 07:09.330
a storm?

07:10.719 --> 07:14.173
Three  kids dead, eight days, then...

07:15.970 --> 07:16.594
it was gone.

07:18.362 --> 07:19.233
Any more dreams?

07:20.752 --> 07:21.712
Not since May.

07:24.004 --> 07:25.135
Nothing since May.

07:28.446 --> 07:29.276
How's he doing?

07:30.453 --> 07:31.396
He's the same.

07:34.313 --> 07:35.313
Say hi for me, will you?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.573
Well, the Houston Astros won again,

08:07.918 --> 08:09.135
6-4 against the Cardinals.

08:14.871 --> 08:17.102
There's still rain in the Panhandle.

08:18.751 --> 08:21.716
Oh, uh, the governor called you yesterday.

08:23.254 --> 08:25.678
He wanted you to know his thoughts were with you.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.390
You're a damn ignoramus, you know that, Kenneth Push?

08:40.013 --> 08:41.698
Cutting those wires so, what?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.625
Huh? So you could tell me he was a sperm donor?!

08:44.775 --> 08:45.796
That was the big news?!

08:46.712 --> 08:48.064
That that's how they were all related?!

08:49.010 --> 08:50.495
That was worth trying to kill yourself for?!

08:52.580 --> 08:53.611
Well, we got that!

08:54.322 --> 08:56.225
Two days later, the victims' mothers told us that.

08:57.127 --> 08:59.114
And now, look at you: here you are-- nowhere.

08:59.681 --> 09:00.332
In a coma.

09:00.702 --> 09:01.911
You're no use to anybody.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.074
Whose idea was it for you to seek therapy?

09:10.033 --> 09:13.099
I told you. My wife and I 
went through a difficult period a couple of months ago.

09:13.307 --> 09:16.543
Once things cooled down and we talked about what had happened,

09:16.835 --> 09:18.526
it was one of the promises that I made.

09:19.070 --> 09:19.778
We each...

09:20.171 --> 09:21.140
made promises.

09:21.611 --> 09:22.641
And what did she promise?

09:23.824 --> 09:24.431
I don't know. Uh...

09:25.029 --> 09:26.119
be more considerate, mostly.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.144
Of who? Of what?

09:29.117 --> 09:32.461
Of me, I guess... mostly.

09:33.538 --> 09:34.863
And how long ago was this?

09:35.349 --> 09:37.765
Uh, three months or so; just before the summer.

09:38.562 --> 09:40.132
What took you so long to get in here?

09:40.850 --> 09:42.533
I don't know.
It was summer.

09:42.675 --> 09:45.355
The weeks got away from me, and when I finally did call, you were on vacation.

09:47.831 --> 09:48.787
So, what does that make me, Doc--

09:49.402 --> 09:51.521
bipolar, codependent, manic-depressive?

09:53.907 --> 09:54.786
Homosexual.

09:59.368 --> 10:02.664
Is your wife typically inconsiderate of you?

10:04.831 --> 10:06.706
Typically, my wife is anything but inconsiderate.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.173
If anything, she suffers from an overabundance of empathy.

10:11.450 --> 10:12.779
It's a kind of disease with her.

10:12.981 --> 10:14.858
She experiences it with almost everyone she encounters:

10:15.215 --> 10:17.193
friends and neighbors, strangers.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.018
Dead people.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.730
And how do you account for this lapse?

10:25.052 --> 10:25.518
Lapse?

10:26.158 --> 10:28.156
Well, you said you made some sort of bargain.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.831
She'd be more considerate; you'd go into therapy.

10:31.975 --> 10:34.760
I'm guessing her excessive empathy was not in evidence

10:35.043 --> 10:37.769
when whatever it was that happened to precipitate the bargain...

10:39.064 --> 10:39.552
happened.

10:40.428 --> 10:41.839
You know what?
It was nothing. It was stupid.

10:41.977 --> 10:44.497
I acted like an ass, to be perfectly honest with you.

10:45.597 --> 10:46.056
Tell me.

10:47.061 --> 10:48.590
There's nothing to tell.

10:49.108 --> 10:49.543
It was...

10:53.754 --> 10:54.620
Her work got intense.

10:56.407 --> 10:57.209
She was home less and less.

10:57.609 --> 10:59.448
One night, we made a plan; she didn't make it.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.684
She didn't call, and I got angry.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.093
But in the scheme of things, it really, it was no big deal.

11:07.255 --> 11:09.100
She didn't even call?

11:10.520 --> 11:11.155
No.

11:12.137 --> 11:15.931
Oh, you know, it sounds profoundly inconsiderate to me.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.037
What is your wife?

11:18.902 --> 11:20.193
Is she a brain surgeon?

11:21.121 --> 11:22.806
Was she in surgery or something?

11:25.287 --> 11:28.887
No, she, uh, she works as a legal consultant.

11:29.886 --> 11:30.979
I don't know.

11:31.973 --> 11:35.104
That  sounds profoundly inconsiderate to me.

11:35.349 --> 11:36.451
No, you're misunderstanding...

11:37.810 --> 11:39.535
Well, that's our session for today.

11:40.552 --> 11:41.944
Terrific meeting you, Mr. Bourgeois.

11:44.987 --> 11:45.955
"Mr. Bourgeois"?

11:46.723 --> 11:49.227
Inspires a lot of confidence, don't you think?

11:51.321 --> 11:52.472
So what else did he say?

11:53.510 --> 11:55.012
I don't remember. Nothing important.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.228
Did  you tell him about me?

11:57.624 --> 11:58.737
Why, you think you're important?

12:00.688 --> 12:02.669
Obviously you were a big part of the conversation.

12:03.897 --> 12:04.869
But you didn't tell him...?

12:05.815 --> 12:06.574
About your secret?

12:07.506 --> 12:12.465
How you came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.

12:13.224 --> 12:13.849
Shut up.

12:15.213 --> 12:17.198
If you don't want to go anymore, you don't have to go anymore.

12:18.365 --> 12:20.220
I mean, it seems kind of silly now.

12:21.389 --> 12:22.110
We're still here.

12:24.324 --> 12:25.106
Everything's good.

12:27.326 --> 12:28.338
Least I think it is.

12:29.249 --> 12:29.629
Is it?

12:31.625 --> 12:32.876
I mean, it is for me.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.904
I just, I can't help but wonder about you.

12:36.605 --> 12:38.100
You mean because of the dreams?

12:38.361 --> 12:39.270
I mean all of it.

12:39.402 --> 12:41.085
You're not working.
You're not dreaming.

12:41.525 --> 12:44.126
But I'm fine. I'm really fine.

12:46.076 --> 12:46.456
Okay.

12:48.519 --> 12:48.866
I don't know.

12:49.197 --> 12:50.455
Maybe I'll cancel next week.

12:51.333 --> 12:51.706
I don't know.

12:53.988 --> 12:55.563
Are you sure he didn't say anything about me?

12:58.739 --> 12:59.406
Actually, he did.

13:01.212 --> 13:05.293
He said you sounded like you were profoundly beautiful.

13:07.196 --> 13:08.813
"Profoundly beautiful."

13:12.389 --> 13:13.096
I like that.

13:17.044 --> 13:17.561
Who pees first?

13:18.337 --> 13:18.726
Oh, my God.

13:19.647 --> 13:20.521
It's my birthday.

13:21.486 --> 13:23.908
And it's my apartment, so, obviously, I pee first.

13:24.313 --> 13:26.556
But I'm older, and I actually drank more than you,

13:26.877 --> 13:30.261
and besides, it's past midnight, so it's not your birthday anymore.

13:30.759 --> 13:34.315
So, keep your cool, cross your legs, and before you know it, it will be your turn.

13:43.342 --> 13:45.759
Hurry up!
I'm don't want to fall asleep and wet the bed!

13:47.821 --> 13:50.657
I don't want to alarm you, but I actually peed a couple of swizzle sticks.

13:51.382 --> 13:53.218
Don't worry.
They flushed fine.

13:53.393 --> 13:55.058
Didn't stop up your commode, or anything.

13:55.413 --> 13:57.415
Hey, you don't mind if I take a moment and wash my hands, do you?

13:57.685 --> 13:58.936
You have nothing but time, right?

13:59.593 --> 14:00.232
Ya-da-dee,

14:00.949 --> 14:02.325
ya-da-di...

14:03.895 --> 14:05.954
Hey, your teeth floating yet?

14:06.727 --> 14:07.924
All right, it's your 18th birthday.

14:08.070 --> 14:10.604
I guess I can let you void your pretty little self.

14:12.660 --> 14:12.983
Hey.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.905
Chris, the, uh, the door is stuck.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.129
Chris, not funny.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.104
Open the door!

14:21.656 --> 14:22.174
Chris?

14:24.176 --> 14:25.042
Chris!

14:27.436 --> 14:28.071
At the top of our news,

14:28.377 --> 14:29.880
the apparent abduction of Christina...

14:30.225 --> 14:31.621
I'm hearing it for the first time right now.

14:32.107 --> 14:33.923
...returned home from an 18th birthday celebration.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.572
Lovel, who, according to her boyfriend, was snatched sometime after 1:00 in the morning

14:38.800 --> 14:41.241
after  her abductor locked him in the bathroom...

14:41.807 --> 14:44.380
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on there?!

14:45.171 --> 14:47.154
It's not my fault.
She didn't say when.

14:47.288 --> 14:49.278
No, I would love to meet you at the crime scene.

14:49.392 --> 14:52.132
It's just that school just started again, and I'm not dressed. I...

14:53.156 --> 14:53.887
It's Devalos.

14:54.222 --> 14:56.337
He and Scanlon are meeting at the crime scene in half an hour,

14:56.473 --> 14:57.773
and he was wondering if I could get down there.

14:58.177 --> 14:59.389
I've got a project briefing at 8:45.

15:00.105 --> 15:01.561
No way I can get there before 10:00.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.216
He's got to be in court at 10:00.

15:05.473 --> 15:07.153
Mommy didn't finish covering my books last night, and she promised.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.364
That's not fair.

15:09.472 --> 15:10.707
No, that's not going to fly.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.464
You don't know my husband.

15:13.790 --> 15:16.801
Okay, Detective Scanlon said that if you can drop the kids off at school,

15:17.048 --> 15:18.673
he'll send a police car to pick me up in 20 minutes.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.422
And he says if you won't pick up the kids,

15:23.872 --> 15:27.412
he will send three police cars with their sirens blaring to pick me up in 20 minutes.

15:29.445 --> 15:29.875
What?

15:31.295 --> 15:32.939
Go ahead. Throw on some clothes.
I'll make some calls.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.195
I'll make it work somehow.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.355
- Are you sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

15:36.489 --> 15:37.568
What choice do I have?

15:37.822 --> 15:39.105
You're obviously profoundly...

15:43.646 --> 15:44.142
happy.

15:45.066 --> 15:48.023
With all due respect, my dear, you, me, the police department, and yes,

15:48.192 --> 15:51.217
even His Honor the Mayor, are now at the mercy of the FBI and the federal

15:51.341 --> 15:56.776
bankruptcy courts, so if you would kindly take a second and get your pointy shoes out of my ass,

15:57.032 --> 16:01.038
perhaps we could strategize as to what we're going to do to get those two august bodies

16:01.308 --> 16:02.148
to speed this thing along.

16:10.021 --> 16:10.745
What you looking at?

16:13.595 --> 16:15.227
Why don't you come over here and see for yourself?

16:19.383 --> 16:20.183
Nice to see you.

16:20.802 --> 16:21.881
What's it been, a couple months?

16:22.057 --> 16:23.169
Thought maybe you quit the business.

16:23.561 --> 16:25.279
Nope. Business quit me.

16:25.987 --> 16:28.589
You know how it is: you can't find a good violent crime when you need one.

16:30.897 --> 16:33.861
So, what makes everybody so sure this has anything to do with The Phant...

16:37.165 --> 16:37.863
Isaiah.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.117
There he be.

16:40.627 --> 16:43.437
Didn't even notice till ten minutes ago when I switched on the light.

16:47.688 --> 16:48.618
You know what stinks?

16:49.797 --> 16:50.587
People are dying?

16:51.929 --> 16:52.884
That goes without saying,

16:53.094 --> 16:55.635
but what really stinks is the way this guy keeps making asses out of us.

16:56.493 --> 16:56.973
We can't figure out

16:57.113 --> 16:57.654
who he is.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.862
We can't find his records, but he's found them.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.825
Somewhere along the way, he found them, and was able

17:02.946 --> 17:04.914
to get the name and address of every child he fathered.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.174
Tell me you had a dream.

17:14.202 --> 17:15.537
Tell me you can unwind this thing.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.507
Actually, I haven't had a dream in months.

17:19.542 --> 17:22.042
It's like it's all stopped up in there or something.

17:22.148 --> 17:23.046
I don't know.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.229
Is there a bathroom I can use without destroying any evidence?

17:30.166 --> 17:30.828
You all right?

17:31.262 --> 17:32.031
Yeah, I'm just...

17:32.217 --> 17:34.346
The crime scene boys took over a vacant apartment at the end of the hall.

17:35.719 --> 17:36.750
Suddenly, I just...

17:55.661 --> 17:56.988
Ms. Dubois, can you hear me?

17:59.414 --> 18:00.260
Ms. Dubois?

18:06.215 --> 18:08.954
Can one of your cars take me over to St. Christopher's Hospital right away?

18:09.528 --> 18:09.837
You all right?

18:10.359 --> 18:11.924
No, it's not me. It's Captain Push.

18:13.256 --> 18:14.418
I think he might be dead.

18:15.896 --> 18:16.688
My name's Allison Dubois.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.847
I'm with the District Attorney's office.

18:18.962 --> 18:22.044
I've been calling for the last hour on the condition of Captain Kenneth Push.

18:22.493 --> 18:23.209
Who are you, family?

18:23.841 --> 18:24.625
Please, just tell me.

18:25.181 --> 18:27.055
I'm sorry, miss, unless you're family...

18:28.046 --> 18:28.890
I... wait!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.064
He's not in there.

18:44.413 --> 18:44.859
Mrs. Dubois?

18:47.221 --> 18:48.021
Mrs. Dubois?

18:50.255 --> 18:50.677
Don't cry.

18:52.285 --> 18:53.045
There's  no reason to cry.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.321
How can you say that?

18:56.444 --> 18:59.834
Because I'm dead, and everything that matters--

19:00.701 --> 19:01.965
matters to me, anyway--

19:02.261 --> 19:02.954
I can see.

19:04.568 --> 19:05.855
I know how it works out.

19:06.992 --> 19:08.505
I know how it all works out.

19:09.128 --> 19:10.067
You do, huh?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.954
Oh, you see everything, you know everything?

19:14.045 --> 19:16.168
Well... do you know this?

19:17.772 --> 19:20.747
Do you know that I hate what you've done to yourself?

19:21.068 --> 19:23.338
Do you know that I hate what you've done to me?

19:38.392 --> 19:39.966
One, two, three.

19:42.387 --> 19:42.765
Sorry.

19:44.945 --> 19:45.978
Here you go, Captain.

19:48.127 --> 19:48.550
That's nice.

19:50.765 --> 19:51.730
Nice and clean.

19:52.353 --> 19:53.953
Teeth brushed, face shaved.

20:05.585 --> 20:07.150
I don't understand. You're not dead?

20:08.801 --> 20:11.545
Well, he's not... but I am.

20:12.234 --> 20:14.004
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

20:15.103 --> 20:19.851
Well, I smoked too much, drank too much, lived too hard, but my son...

20:20.611 --> 20:22.543
Your s... your son?

20:25.577 --> 20:27.002
You're Captain Push's father?

20:27.483 --> 20:28.252
Yes, ma'am.

20:29.030 --> 20:30.091
Oh, wow.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.340
I thought you knew that this morning in the bathroom.

20:33.992 --> 20:34.735
That was you?

20:36.883 --> 20:40.799
So... he's not dead?

20:42.510 --> 20:43.143
No, ma'am.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.377
You know...

20:48.301 --> 20:51.945
...when you die, ain't much else to do but watch your own.

20:53.216 --> 20:54.250
So, when he cut them wires...

20:56.261 --> 20:57.397
I was waiting for him.

20:58.937 --> 21:02.106
I was there when he saw what he saw and tried to tell you about it.

21:04.236 --> 21:05.598
When he tried to send you his dream.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.064
Yeah, I got that.
I got his dream.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.110
It was worthless.

21:10.798 --> 21:12.021
The whole thing has been worthless,

21:12.309 --> 21:14.355
a waste of a really great life.

21:14.859 --> 21:15.582
That's not true.

21:16.987 --> 21:18.271
And that's what I'm here to tell you about.

21:19.258 --> 21:20.841
The waste was yours.

21:22.127 --> 21:23.249
You didn't dream the whole dream.

21:23.389 --> 21:25.147
You cut it off. You put yourself in it.

21:25.831 --> 21:28.220
You were too preoccupied with what was going on in your own life

21:28.718 --> 21:30.085
to see what he was trying to show you.

21:30.337 --> 21:32.900
You'd have seen you're chasing the wrong man.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.377
What, what are you talking about-- "the wrong man"?

21:36.993 --> 21:37.804
Do you know who he is?

21:38.899 --> 21:39.400
No.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.673
They brought him back to life before he had a chance to tell me, but...

21:45.184 --> 21:47.710
even if I knew, it's not for me to say.

21:48.376 --> 21:49.708
He's the one trying to talk to you.

21:51.133 --> 21:52.337
You got to dream the dream.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.054
I can't. I haven't dreamt in months.

21:58.535 --> 22:00.434
And you won't ever again...

22:02.038 --> 22:02.896
unless you finish it.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.101
You got to finish it.

22:09.648 --> 22:10.346
You got to dream it.

22:26.572 --> 22:27.243
The wrong man?

22:27.828 --> 22:28.906
I know it's not what you want to hear.

22:29.972 --> 22:31.470
DiNovi, Lynn DiNovi.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.881
And I've been on hold for 20 minutes.

22:33.609 --> 22:35.950
I understand that the Director of the Bureau is a very busy man,

22:36.488 --> 22:38.983
but I've got the District Attorney of Phoenix standing here,

22:39.180 --> 22:40.692
and he's about to be summoned to court.

22:41.922 --> 22:42.763
A message you can slip him?

22:43.501 --> 22:46.798
Sure. Tell him we've got a guy running around here cutting out people's hearts,

22:46.947 --> 22:49.307
and we were wondering if he has a suggestion as to

22:49.499 --> 22:51.468
what we could use to get the bloodstains out of the sidewalk.

22:52.036 --> 22:54.748
You wouldn't happen to know who the right man is, would you?

22:55.059 --> 22:56.265
Not specifically, no.

22:56.769 --> 22:58.948
Allison, the mayor, the governor, the chief of police--

22:59.595 --> 23:01.949
every branch of government is putting pressure on the FBI

23:02.132 --> 23:03.573
to find those records and get us a name--

23:04.124 --> 23:05.737
the name of the man who fathered those children.

23:06.608 --> 23:07.664
I'm aware of all that.

23:08.531 --> 23:11.255
"Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers":

23:11.551 --> 23:14.475
that's the message the killer leaves at the scene of every murder.

23:14.714 --> 23:16.618
I know. I've been at the scene of almost every murder.

23:16.745 --> 23:18.168
Then think about what you're saying.

23:18.457 --> 23:19.788
The only thing these victims have in common

23:20.031 --> 23:22.234
in that they were fathered by the same man; that's it.

23:22.523 --> 23:24.268
Now, you tell me: who else could it be?

23:24.496 --> 23:25.265
I don't know.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.808
Allison, people are hysterical; the media's gone crazy;

23:29.017 --> 23:29.980
the city's in a panic;

23:30.075 --> 23:32.034
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to call the powers

23:32.132 --> 23:34.097
that be and tell them to disregard the one lead--

23:34.470 --> 23:36.164
the only lead-- that we have.

23:37.229 --> 23:39.477
And I like Mr. Grusten, but I don't like Mrs. Laker.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.861
And I like Ms. Villa, but I'm not sure about Ms. Fritz.

23:43.302 --> 23:44.967
Boy, you sure have a lot of teachers.

23:45.430 --> 23:48.424
It's the sixth grade. Everyone has a lot of teachers in sixth grade.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.083
Well, you can't argue with that.

23:51.385 --> 23:52.507
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.222
- Daddy?|- Yes?

23:56.735 --> 23:57.549
I don't understand.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.933
I'm in the sixth grade.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.018
Why am I going to bed the same time as a first grader?

24:02.006 --> 24:04.941
Hey, it's not my fault I'm in first grade. I got born late.

24:06.448 --> 24:07.435
Uh, Mom?

24:08.665 --> 24:11.007
Well, that is an excellent question.

24:11.595 --> 24:11.961
I know.

24:12.521 --> 24:14.090
But I think Dad and I need to sleep on it.

24:14.926 --> 24:16.181
It's only 8:00.

24:16.461 --> 24:18.319
I don't think letting her stay up till 8:30...

24:18.979 --> 24:19.814
Well, see, look.

24:20.212 --> 24:21.769
Looks like you already have Dad in your corner.

24:22.527 --> 24:23.150
Yeah.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.555
- Night.|- Night.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.660
Do you want to tell me what just happened in there?

24:32.416 --> 24:33.166
Nothing happened in there.

24:33.449 --> 24:35.763
An 11-year-old girl just asked her parents for a later bedtime,

24:36.115 --> 24:37.578
and her mother said she'd like to sleep on it.

24:38.317 --> 24:39.830
And what is it you're doing right now?

24:40.576 --> 24:42.047
I am getting ready to sleep on it.

24:43.444 --> 24:45.502
Uh, this, this, like, this rush to bed--

24:45.682 --> 24:49.294
this... wouldn't have anything to do with me, would it?

24:50.061 --> 24:52.208
Oh, yes, oh, my, yes.

24:53.132 --> 24:53.754
Mm-hmm.

24:59.652 --> 25:00.761
Aren't you forgetting something?

25:01.891 --> 25:02.769
No. I brushed.

25:03.524 --> 25:05.004
No. I meant, uh...

25:07.686 --> 25:08.229
me.

25:19.302 --> 25:21.895
Captain Push's late father came to visit me today.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.636
He told me that I completely misread the dream

25:25.837 --> 25:28.226
that his son risked his life trying to send me;

25:30.323 --> 25:31.225
that I didn't finish it;

25:32.126 --> 25:34.637
that if I ever hoped to find out who the Phoenix Phantom was,

25:35.687 --> 25:37.158
if I ever hoped to dream again...

25:39.468 --> 25:41.434
then I needed to re-dream Captain Push's dream.

25:42.777 --> 25:43.899
I needed to finish it.

25:44.956 --> 25:45.944
And you want that?

25:46.726 --> 25:48.592
They're looking for the wrong man, Joe.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.222
As long as they're looking for the wrong man,

25:50.412 --> 25:51.627
there's a possibility somebody else might die.

25:52.132 --> 25:53.914
Okay, that wasn't what I asked you.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.104
When that phone rang this morning,

25:59.701 --> 26:01.031
and you heard that they wanted you at the crime scene,

26:02.458 --> 26:06.074
you were positively giddy. You know that?

26:08.157 --> 26:09.427
Why do you look so disappointed?

26:13.310 --> 26:14.201
I saw the shrink.

26:18.988 --> 26:22.495
He kept trying to tell me you were profoundly selfish.

26:33.021 --> 26:34.536
Not profoundly beautiful.

26:35.771 --> 26:36.624
But I don't know.

26:36.901 --> 26:37.692
I think it's me.

26:39.132 --> 26:40.693
I like it better when you're all mine.

26:42.807 --> 26:46.829
When the girls and I don't have to share you with your dreams,

26:49.149 --> 26:51.625
with the cops... with...

26:58.361 --> 27:00.208
You think that makes me  profoundly selfish?

27:06.096 --> 27:06.968
Come here.

27:10.106 --> 27:10.898
Hold me.

27:14.406 --> 27:15.583
Help me dream.

27:44.098 --> 27:45.362
He's baaaaack.

27:47.338 --> 27:48.695
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm going to lose my job.

27:49.442 --> 27:50.010
No, you won't.

27:51.112 --> 27:53.120
You're helping to make some poor, childless couple happy.

27:54.134 --> 27:55.406
No one could fire you for that.

28:12.115 --> 28:14.355
If you're going to just sit there,
you better hand me one of those magazines.

28:18.044 --> 28:18.712
Okay...

28:29.786 --> 28:30.486
but no touching.

28:34.257 --> 28:35.101
You're crazy, you know that?

28:36.627 --> 28:37.886
That church is making you crazy.

28:38.228 --> 28:39.652
I mean... you're my wife.

28:40.543 --> 28:41.401
It's not about that.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.955
I know what it's about.

28:43.603 --> 28:45.567
It's safe. It's perfectly safe.

28:45.812 --> 28:46.442
I read about it.

28:46.575 --> 28:48.080
We can do... whatever.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.554
We can do anything.

28:50.350 --> 28:51.051
I can't help it.

28:52.519 --> 28:55.051
I love this baby. I don't want anything to happen to this baby.

28:55.729 --> 28:56.640
Nothing's going to happen.

28:57.028 --> 28:59.095
How do you think the baby got here in the first place?

29:00.512 --> 29:01.318
Forget that.

29:02.359 --> 29:03.216
Let's just do this.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.512
Just finish what you're doing.

29:06.011 --> 29:06.771
Come on. We need the money.

29:08.477 --> 29:09.415
Don't you hear that?

29:14.650 --> 29:15.371
It's for you.

29:15.790 --> 29:16.273
Mmm.

29:18.967 --> 29:19.597
Hello?

29:20.008 --> 29:21.519
Allison, hi, it's Manuel Devalos.

29:21.758 --> 29:23.453
I'm very sorry to wake you in middle of the night.

29:23.973 --> 29:26.215
We found the body of Christina Lovel.

29:27.006 --> 29:28.294
He hung it from a freeway overpass.

29:29.186 --> 29:32.298
Painted the word "Isaiah" with her blood all along the trestle.

29:33.108 --> 29:34.277
Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:35.003 --> 29:35.639
That's not all.

29:36.144 --> 29:37.181
The FBI finally called.

29:38.571 --> 29:40.818
Oh, my God, that's great.
That's really, really great.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.063
Did you find him? Did you get him?

29:43.446 --> 29:44.739
Uh, we... found him.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.447
Soon as we had a name, we found him.

29:48.223 --> 29:51.590
The only thing is... he's been dead since 1997.

30:18.482 --> 30:19.379
I met your dad.

30:21.224 --> 30:22.164
Seemed like a nice man.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.209
You want some light?

30:38.238 --> 30:39.046
There you go.

30:42.161 --> 30:42.878
I'll sit down.

30:57.275 --> 30:58.093
But no touching.

31:01.761 --> 31:02.491
You're crazy, you know that?

31:04.032 --> 31:05.393
That church is making you crazy.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.328
I mean... you're my wife.

31:07.899 --> 31:08.852
It's not about that.

31:09.338 --> 31:10.232
I know what it's about.

31:11.101 --> 31:13.089
It's safe. It's perfectly safe.

31:13.285 --> 31:13.893
I read about it.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.511
We can do... whatever.

31:15.730 --> 31:16.984
We can do anything.

31:17.798 --> 31:18.636
I can't help it.

31:20.023 --> 31:22.665
I love this baby. I don't want anything to happen to this baby.

31:23.154 --> 31:24.327
Nothing's going to happen.

31:24.477 --> 31:26.515
How do you think the baby got here in the first place?

31:27.989 --> 31:28.582
Forget that.

31:29.842 --> 31:30.420
Let's just do this.

31:30.962 --> 31:31.753
Just finish what you're doing.

31:33.372 --> 31:34.265
Come on. We need the money.

31:40.895 --> 31:41.851
What are you doing?

31:43.500 --> 31:44.391
I'm getting out of here.

31:44.754 --> 31:45.839
What do you mean you're getting out of here?

31:45.973 --> 31:46.851
How are we going to pay the rent?

31:47.422 --> 31:48.441
Don't know. Don't care.

31:50.381 --> 31:51.845
I'm going back home to Texas.

31:53.378 --> 31:54.398
I want a divorce.

31:55.467 --> 31:56.637
Uh... a divorce?

31:57.727 --> 31:59.404
You can't get a divorce. We're having a baby.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.345
It's 1983, darling. Anyone can get a divorce.

32:03.488 --> 32:06.647
Oh, my God. You are the man my daddy said you were.

32:08.605 --> 32:09.376
You would do that?

32:10.367 --> 32:11.860
You would leave me? You would leave us?

32:13.937 --> 32:14.589
No, no-no, no,

32:14.884 --> 32:15.750
no, no, no.

32:16.897 --> 32:18.743
You walk out that door, and you will live to regret it.

32:19.669 --> 32:21.092
I will bring up this child to hate you.

32:22.311 --> 32:23.884
Anything you accomplish, he will undo.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.751
Anything you build up, he will tear down.

32:26.972 --> 32:29.774
Anything you bring into this world, he will take out.

32:53.736 --> 32:54.716
Oh, my God.

32:59.339 --> 32:59.867
Sun.

33:01.840 --> 33:02.560
Sun.

33:03.120 --> 33:03.875
Oh, my God.

33:04.142 --> 33:05.951
He's talking! He's moving!

33:06.135 --> 33:06.508
Sun.

33:08.020 --> 33:08.672
Natural sun.

33:12.568 --> 33:14.040
The sun! The sun woke him!

33:14.277 --> 33:14.975
It was bothering him.

33:15.432 --> 33:17.393
No. Not the light.

33:20.782 --> 33:21.563
Uh, the son.

33:23.199 --> 33:23.896
His child.

33:24.125 --> 33:24.554
His son.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.567
His natural son.

33:28.264 --> 33:31.523
Michael Rooker of Abilene, Texas is listed as the birth father to a boy

33:31.737 --> 33:36.202
born to Catherine Rooker, originally Catherine Naylor, in 1983.

33:37.127 --> 33:39.155
Turns out Isaiah Rooker was born right here in Phoenix.

33:39.925 --> 33:40.818
>From everything we can tell,

33:40.956 --> 33:43.305
he never attended a public school,
never obtained a driver's license,

33:43.545 --> 33:44.817
never registered for the draft,

33:45.061 --> 33:48.079
never received a Social Security card, a library card, a credit card,

33:48.329 --> 33:49.187
or any other kind of card.

33:49.715 --> 33:50.741
For all intents and purposes,

33:50.912 --> 33:53.664
the natural son-- the only son--

33:53.992 --> 33:56.432
the only child to carry Michael Rooker's name

33:57.404 --> 33:59.017
might just as well not exist.

33:59.445 --> 34:00.837
Wait a second. How is that possible?

34:01.334 --> 34:02.593
It's possible... 

34:06.365 --> 34:08.456
if you were brought up to do one thing--

34:09.261 --> 34:10.828
destroy every trace of your father--

34:11.157 --> 34:12.981
slaughter every child he might have helped create.

34:13.899 --> 34:15.038
Which brings us to our next problem.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.404
This is the list from the FBI of every child

34:18.601 --> 34:20.480
they believe was born from the issue of Michael Rooker.

34:20.984 --> 34:22.922
There's one name left. Her name's Bella Kayne.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.414
She turned 18 two days ago.

34:25.925 --> 34:28.527
Right now, she's in protective custody, but we can't keep her there forever.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.697
Since we have no idea what this guy looks like,

34:30.926 --> 34:32.395
where he lives, where he works...

34:34.416 --> 34:35.583
it's not like we can just go pick him up.

34:35.837 --> 34:36.916
If I knew how to identify him,

34:37.085 --> 34:38.518
or at least someone who could identify him,

34:38.681 --> 34:40.920
I'd ask this young woman to come out of hiding

34:41.119 --> 34:44.010
just long enough to lure him out into the open, but...

34:45.650 --> 34:47.510
since there's absolutely nobody who knows who he is

34:47.674 --> 34:49.087
or even what he looks like, it's...

34:51.835 --> 34:52.984
Mr. District Attorney,

34:53.369 --> 34:54.777
I'm not so sure that's true.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.250
Once you explained it was his natural son,

34:57.586 --> 34:58.808
everything just fell into place.

34:59.941 --> 35:02.818
That was today? That was this morning?

35:04.545 --> 35:05.725
I was still coming out of the fog.

35:06.186 --> 35:09.032
I had no recollection of that. It's like, uh...

35:10.632 --> 35:12.708
like I laid down for a nap in May...

35:15.658 --> 35:17.046
and woke up three hours ago.

35:18.476 --> 35:19.507
You don't remember anything?

35:24.004 --> 35:25.131
You know he's still out there.

35:27.352 --> 35:28.577
And you're the only one who's seen him.

35:29.997 --> 35:30.697
What do you mean?

35:30.932 --> 35:32.668
You're the only one who knows what he looks like.

35:33.294 --> 35:34.113
But I don't.

35:34.403 --> 35:35.273
Yeah, you do.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.522
In that moment when you were dead,

35:37.801 --> 35:40.040
in that moment when you could see everything...

35:41.607 --> 35:42.892
I'm betting that you saw this boy.

35:44.235 --> 35:46.263
I'm betting that he's locked up in there somewhere.

35:47.182 --> 35:48.807
He's not locked anywhere.

35:50.580 --> 35:55.071
I was in a coma. I was gone.

35:57.351 --> 35:59.732
Now I'm getting back.

36:02.819 --> 36:05.461
I'm just praying I didn't lose any luggage on the trip.

36:08.807 --> 36:10.290
Can I help you find this killer...

36:11.547 --> 36:12.918
Mrs. Dubois?

36:16.207 --> 36:17.114
When I'm finished here,

36:20.587 --> 36:22.675
I'm just hoping I can find my way home.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.050
Bella Kayne works at the Sun Desert Arena.

36:28.209 --> 36:29.473
She has since she was 16.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.874
After graduating high school last June,

36:32.381 --> 36:35.196
she became assistant manager in charge of arena concessions.

36:35.862 --> 36:38.727
She's responsible for the operations on the "F" corridor.

36:40.144 --> 36:41.147
During a game like today's,

36:41.356 --> 36:44.502
over 1,300 individuals cross through this corridor at one time or another.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.229
Fully 17% of those fit the profile of our guy.

36:49.034 --> 36:51.877
What Miss Kayne has very bravely agreed to do is to return to work today

36:52.084 --> 36:53.901
in order to help us draw Isaiah out.

36:56.121 --> 36:58.211
We'll have armed, plain-clothed officers from all your jurisdictions--

36:58.888 --> 36:59.906
city, state, and federal--

37:00.060 --> 37:02.634
posing as concession workers in these eight positions.

37:03.621 --> 37:06.177
Additionally, we're adding extra surveillance cameras to capture images

37:06.457 --> 37:09.122
for later study should our guy show up but decide not to act.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.196
But how can we be certain he'll even show?

37:12.843 --> 37:13.359
We can't.

37:14.284 --> 37:15.014
Can't be certain he'll show.

37:15.134 --> 37:16.854
Can't be certain if he shows, we'll know who he is.

37:17.789 --> 37:18.548
Can't be certain of much.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.918
You can say that again.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.837
Everybody understand what we're looking for tonight?

37:33.599 --> 37:34.834
White male, 22 years old.

37:37.149 --> 37:38.694
Well, now that you narrowed it down for us...

37:40.728 --> 37:42.540
I'm sorry. This doesn't sit right.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.456
What do you mean?

37:44.721 --> 37:45.314
He's a grabber.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.151
He snatches them, and he takes them away and cuts their hearts out.

37:51.439 --> 37:53.587
How the hell is he gonna do that here in front of hundreds of people?

37:54.403 --> 37:56.065
Is that chick from the mayor's office with you right now?

37:58.095 --> 37:58.855
Chick here.

38:01.128 --> 38:04.196
Sorry. Just wondering if you were able to run that little errand we discussed?

38:04.582 --> 38:05.897
Leaking the girl's home address to the press?

38:06.441 --> 38:07.502
Yeah, about 45 minutes ago.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.002
Good. Keep them out of our hair,

38:09.953 --> 38:11.765
just in case our killer was still hoping to grab her at home.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.680
Maybe it'll encourage him to come visit her at work instead.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.422
Hey.
Do you actually know all those guys out there?

38:21.079 --> 38:22.472
I see a lot of unfamiliar faces out there.

38:23.828 --> 38:26.763
Makes me a little nervous being surrounded by so many strangers with guns.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.993
I know.
I don't know half of them.

38:29.213 --> 38:30.815
We got some state guys, couple of feds.

38:32.332 --> 38:33.352
How's Captain Push doing?

38:34.482 --> 38:36.722
Thirsty. Skeptical.

38:41.501 --> 38:42.092
Eyes up, people.

38:43.595 --> 38:44.271
Lee, what's going on in there?:

38:44.783 --> 38:45.700
We may have a live one.

38:47.364 --> 38:49.718
Allison, does anyone over there have any feelings about what we're looking at?

38:50.502 --> 38:51.200
Does he look familiar?

38:55.862 --> 38:57.439
Hmm. Reminds me of my Uncle Ned.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.103
Everybody, relax. It's nothing.

39:11.407 --> 39:12.046
That's the game!

39:27.346 --> 39:27.770
Great game.

39:28.172 --> 39:28.641
Yeah, who played?

39:30.392 --> 39:30.849
What do we do now?

39:31.959 --> 39:34.520
Well, I guess we need to get this young lady back into protective custody.

39:36.737 --> 39:38.688
Miss Kayne, I'm sorry tonight was all for naught,

39:39.189 --> 39:42.299
but that doesn't change the fact that what you did here was very, very brave.

39:43.369 --> 39:44.321
Will you bring the car around for Miss Kayne

39:44.925 --> 39:46.136
and get an escort up to the F Level.

39:46.397 --> 39:49.690
So... what does this mean-- "back to protective custody"?

39:50.073 --> 39:50.854
Back to the hotel?

39:51.273 --> 39:51.834
I'm afraid so.

39:52.897 --> 39:54.247
When is it that you're scheduled to work next?

39:55.511 --> 39:57.657
Um, there's a game two nights from now.

39:58.516 --> 39:58.909
Cool.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.490
$5.15 an hour, all the pop I can drink--

40:01.818 --> 40:03.710
- I'll be here. 
- You can count me in, too.

40:05.376 --> 40:06.319
Excuse me.

40:07.419 --> 40:09.328
We've got a car waiting for Miss Kayne down below.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.465
We'll talk tomorrow...

40:13.287 --> 40:14.189
Pleasure to meet you.

40:22.126 --> 40:22.551
Officer.

40:25.777 --> 40:27.637
Hey! Officer!

40:29.171 --> 40:29.759
Captain Push?

40:30.339 --> 40:31.146
Hey! Isaiah!

40:43.631 --> 40:44.460
We got an officer down.

40:46.681 --> 40:47.437
Are you all right?

40:47.697 --> 40:48.230
Never better.

40:49.190 --> 40:49.964
Never better.

40:51.509 --> 40:53.527
You knew. You knew 'cause you saw him.

40:54.622 --> 40:55.878
You knew exactly what he looked like...

40:56.598 --> 40:58.274
- No.|- ...cause you saw him when you cut those wires.

40:58.513 --> 41:00.285
No, I knew because,

41:00.724 --> 41:04.014
unlike the rest of you up there at five or six feet,

41:04.784 --> 41:05.390
I'm down here,

41:05.745 --> 41:07.905
and I just happened to notice he was wearing

41:08.051 --> 41:10.693
a pair of high-top sneakers under that uniform.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.719
And as he was walking away, I started thinking,

41:17.860 --> 41:22.030
"What sort of peace officer wears high-top sneakers?"

41:22.725 --> 41:25.437
And that was all I was gonna ask him the first two times I called to him.

41:29.277 --> 41:32.918
Sorry. Had nothing to do with dying.

41:34.744 --> 41:38.728
Just an old law man doing his old law man thing.

41:47.758 --> 41:48.724
I think you're back, Captain Push.

41:49.992 --> 41:53.485
And I do believe all your luggage made the trip just fine.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.313
- Hey.|- Hey.

42:06.783 --> 42:07.665
Any dreams?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.573
Mm-hmm.

42:11.289 --> 42:12.229
Yeah, me, too.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.771
So you ready for what's next?

42:18.828 --> 42:19.659
Mm.

42:20.235 --> 42:21.851
Yeah, me, too.

42:22.812 --> 42:24.946
