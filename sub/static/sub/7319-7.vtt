WEBVTT

00:11.533 --> 00:13.533
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.567 --> 00:16.367
(Miranda) YOU UNDERSTAND THERE
ARE RULES TO YOUR PROBATION?

00:16.400 --> 00:18.533
(Addison) THE DIVORCE
WAS FINALIZED THIS MORNING.

00:18.567 --> 00:21.033
I THINK I NEED
A LITTLE TIME TO--
TAKE SOME SPACE.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.300
YEAH.
THE OTHER NIGHT?

00:22.333 --> 00:24.100
THAT WAS ME BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.167
I SLEPT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.833
IT WAS NOT CHEERFUL.
IT WAS DIRTY.

00:27.867 --> 00:30.667
(Cristina) YOU TOLD ME
YOUR HAND WAS FINE.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.100
IT'S NOT FINE!

00:32.133 --> 00:33.433
(Cristina) STOP WORRYING.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.667
WE ARE A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.433
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.767
***

00:46.500 --> 00:49.633
(Meredith) AS SURGEONS, WE'RE
TRAINED TO LOOK FOR DISEASE.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.700
YOU'RE GOING CAMPING?

00:51.733 --> 00:53.733
YEAH, WITH SHEPHERD. YES.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.533
WITH THE SLEEPING
ON THE GROUND

00:55.567 --> 00:58.433
AND EVERYONE PEEING
BEHIND THE SAME BUSH?
FRESH AIR.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.433
SOMETIMES THE PROBLEM'S
EASILY DETECTED.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.700
WE HAVE BACK-TO-BACK CABGs.
I BOOKED THE O.R.s.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.200
I CANCELED THE O.R.s.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.067
WHY?

01:08.067 --> 01:10.333
BECAUSE I'M GOING CAMPING
WITH SHEPHERD.

01:10.367 --> 01:12.767
***

01:12.800 --> 01:14.333
BUT WHY?

01:14.367 --> 01:16.267
AH, GETTING AWAY,
OUT OF THE CITY,

01:16.300 --> 01:17.700
MEN BEING MEN.
(laughs)

01:17.733 --> 01:19.067
MOUNTAIN MEN IN THE WILD.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.500
AH, THE OPEN ROAD.
THE ROAD NOT TAKEN.

01:21.533 --> 01:23.600
THE UNCHARTED COURSE.
TERRA INCOGNITA.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.400
WELL, OKAY.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.233
MOST OF THE TIME,
YOU NEED TO GO STEP-BY-STEP,

01:28.267 --> 01:29.600
FIRST PROBING THE SURFACE,

01:29.633 --> 01:31.533
LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN
OF TROUBLE...

01:31.567 --> 01:33.467
WE DO HAVE TO MAKE ONE STOP.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.367
***

01:35.400 --> 01:38.267
A MOLE OR A LESION
OR AN UNWELCOME LUMP.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.067
MOUNTAIN MEN IN THE WILD.

01:40.067 --> 01:40.833
YEAH.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.600
TERRA INCOGNITA.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.533
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
MY FIRST CAMPING TRIP.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.467
OH, YOU DON'T SAY?

01:46.500 --> 01:49.467
SO, PRESTON...
ANY OTHER LITTLE SURPRISES?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.400
YOU HAVE SUNSCREEN
AND INSECT REPELLANT?

01:51.433 --> 01:54.100
OH, AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A SHOVEL TO BURY YOUR POOP.
IZZIE, I'M NOT 5.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.167
ZIP ME.
AND IF CALLIE CALLS,

01:56.200 --> 01:59.167
WILL YOU TELL HER...
TELL HER I'M A MOUNTAIN MAN.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.067
I'M A MAN ON A MOUNTAIN,
RIGHT, DR. BURKE?

02:01.100 --> 02:03.067
OKAY, HIM I INVITED.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.667
IZZIE BAKED US TREATS.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.067
HAVE FUN WITH YOUR, UM...

02:08.100 --> 02:09.600
SPACE...

02:09.633 --> 02:10.833
OR WHATEVER.

02:10.867 --> 02:12.333
HMM.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.433
I JUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED
AN EXTRA TENT.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.633
MAYBE JOE MISUNDERSTOOD?

02:16.667 --> 02:19.500
HEY, YOU WANT TO FOLLOW US
OR SHOULD WE FOLLOW YOU?

02:19.533 --> 02:21.533
(mumbles softly)
HEY, GUYS.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.367
THAT WASN'T ME, I SWEAR.

02:27.100 --> 02:31.067
***

02:31.067 --> 02:32.800
MOST OF THE TIME,

02:32.833 --> 02:36.500
WE CAN'T TELL WHAT'S WRONG
WITH SOMEBODY

02:36.533 --> 02:37.633
BY JUST LOOKING AT THEM.

02:37.667 --> 02:41.167
AFTER ALL, THEY CAN LOOK
PERFECTLY FINE ON THE OUTSIDE

02:41.200 --> 02:45.300
WHILE THEIR INSIDES TELL US
A WHOLE OTHER STORY.

02:45.333 --> 02:49.200
***

02:51.333 --> 02:54.333
***

03:09.533 --> 03:13.200

03:13.233 --> 03:15.700
DEREK'S CAMPING--
TAKING TIME,

03:15.733 --> 03:17.200
GETTING SPACE.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.133
PRESTONS DO NOT GO
INTO THE WOODS.

03:19.167 --> 03:21.067
A GUY NAMED PRESTON IS GONNA GET
HIS ASS KICKED BY A SQUIRREL.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.067
IT'S BASICALLY A SLUMBER PARTY.
THEY DO IT OUTSIDE,

03:23.067 --> 03:25.467
WE DO IT INSIDE. THAT'S REALLY
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.167
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT'S HIS FACE?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.400
ALEX KAREV.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.333
POOR BASTARD
SEEMS TO GET A THRILL

03:30.367 --> 03:32.400
OUT OF TAGGING ALONG AFTER ME.
(laughs)

03:32.433 --> 03:34.233
HE'S CAMPING.
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

03:34.267 --> 03:36.633
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GET A THRILL
OUT OF TAGGING ALONG AFTER ME?

03:36.667 --> 03:38.700
DR. BAILEY
MAKES THE ASSIGNMENTS.

03:38.733 --> 03:40.567
DR. BAILEY SAYS IT'S FINE.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.200
GO.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.467
STEVENS, CONFERENCE ROOM.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.667
YOU'RE SPENDING THE DAY
WITH A PEER COUNSELOR.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.333
IS THAT LIKE A SHRINK?

03:49.367 --> 03:51.567
THE HOSPITAL'S ALREADY
MAKING ME SEE A SHRINK.
GO...

03:51.600 --> 03:53.167
MEET YOUR PEER,
GET COUNSELED.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.300
EXCITING PROCEDURES ON
THE BOARD TODAY, HUH, YANG?

03:55.333 --> 03:58.300
YES, DR. BAILEY. WHICH ONE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START WITH?

03:58.333 --> 03:59.800
(Cristina) ARE THOSE...

03:59.833 --> 04:01.200
(Miranda) MONOPOLY PIECES.

04:01.233 --> 04:02.700
21 OF THEM TO BE EXACT,

04:02.733 --> 04:03.967
MOSTLY HOUSES AND HOTELS.

04:04.067 --> 04:08.167
I ALSO SWALLOWED THE THIMBLE,
THE RACECAR, OH, AND THE SHOE.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.333
ERIC AND HIS OLDER BROTHER
DON'T ALWAYS GET ALONG.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.633
HE WOULDN'T LET ME PLAY MONOPOLY
WITH HIM AND HIS FRIENDS.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.333
THIS WAY NOBODY COULD PLAY.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.400
YANG, WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?

04:16.433 --> 04:18.600
IS THIS EVEN SURGICAL?
YANG.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.233
(clears throat)

04:20.267 --> 04:22.167
TRACK AND INVENTORY
ALL THE PIECES,

04:22.200 --> 04:24.267
MEASURE THE PROGRESS
IN X-RAYS,

04:24.300 --> 04:26.300
KEEP EXAMINING THE STOOL.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.133
VERY GOOD.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.267
ENJOY.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.700
OH...

04:30.733 --> 04:33.700
DR. BAILEY, ISN'T THIS
MORE OF A NURSE'S JOB?

04:33.733 --> 04:35.633
ARE YOU TOO GOOD
TO HELP THAT BOY?

04:35.667 --> 04:38.100
YES.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.233
I-I JUST THOUGHT
I'D BE MORE HELP

04:42.267 --> 04:45.133
IF I WAS ASSISTING YOU
IN A SURGERY.
NO SURGERIES FOR YOU.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.067
NO, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.067
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU ERASED MY NAME

04:49.100 --> 04:50.700
FROM THE O.R. BOARD.

04:50.733 --> 04:52.767
I-I'M--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.700
DON'T GIVE ME THAT FAKE
CONFUSED LOOK.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.733
IT IRRITATES ME. YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.633
YOU ERASED MY NAME FROM BURKE'S
HUMPTY DUMPTY SURGERY.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.333
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW IT.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.333
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHY.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.433
I...

05:08.833 --> 05:11.300
HAVE NO COMMENT.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.067
NO SURGERIES.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.267
OKAY, BEFORE YOU START,

05:16.300 --> 05:20.067
THERE ARE RULES TO THIS...
FRIENDSHIP THING OR WHATEVER.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.833
THE DIRTY MISTRESSES CLUB
HAS RULES?

05:21.867 --> 05:24.333
GOSH, YOU'D THINK A BUNCH
OF DIRTY MISTRESSES

05:24.367 --> 05:27.433
WOULD BE A LITTLE LESS UPTIGHT
ABOUT THINGS LIKE RULES.

05:27.467 --> 05:29.333
NUMBER ONE, NO FLIRTING.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.367
SECOND,
NO TALKING ABOUT DEREK.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.500
"C"--NO GIVING ME THE FACE.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.800
THE FACE?

05:36.833 --> 05:38.833
THE McSTEAMY FACE.
IT DOESN'T WORK ON ME.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.767
I'M IMMUNE.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.467
YOU KNOW, IF I'D GONE OFF
TO THE WOODS,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.633
I WOULD HAVE INVITED YOU
TO KEEP ME WARM.

05:45.667 --> 05:50.433
BREAKING RULES
ONE, TWO AND THREE.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.367
OH! IZZIE!

05:52.400 --> 05:54.300
SYDNEY.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.600
YOU'RE MY COUNSELOR.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.500
PEER COUNSELOR.
WE'RE EQUALS.

05:57.533 --> 05:59.733
(laughs) OH.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.233
HOW ARE YOU?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.733
FINE. I'M FINE.

06:03.767 --> 06:06.600
NOW THAT IS
"OUTSIDE IZZIE" TALKING.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.400
OKAY?

06:08.433 --> 06:10.567
HOW'S "INSIDE IZZIE"?

06:10.600 --> 06:14.300
(chuckles)

06:14.333 --> 06:15.600
(elevator bell dings)

06:17.333 --> 06:19.567
SO... YOU AND DEREK,

06:19.600 --> 06:21.300
YOU GUYS TOGETHER OR...

06:21.333 --> 06:24.100
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION,
AND I'LL STOP ASKING.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.067
DEREK AND I ARE TAKING
SOME SPACE.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.700
YOU'RE TAKING SPACE
FROM EACH OTHER,

06:27.733 --> 06:29.633
OR HE'S TAKING SOME SPACE
FROM YOU?

06:29.667 --> 06:31.567
DEREK AND I--
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF WATER

06:31.600 --> 06:33.100
UNDER THE... THING
OR SOMETHING.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.800
WHATEVER. (sighs)

06:34.833 --> 06:38.200
MY KNIGHT IN SHINING
POLY-COTTON.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.133
MORNING, DONNA.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.333
VICKY.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.067
HOW WAS THE TRIP?
SMOOTH, PERFECT.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.233
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

06:44.267 --> 06:47.200
SHE'S STILL HAVING
SOME PENIS ISSUES.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.067
I'M SORRY?

06:51.233 --> 06:53.233
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

06:53.267 --> 06:55.667
I BELIEVE YOU'RE MISSING
THE FACT THAT DR. SLOAN

06:55.700 --> 06:57.467
IS PLANNING TO REMOVE
MY HUSBAND'S PENIS

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
THIS AFTERNOON.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.267
OH. UH...
AND YOUR HUSBAND IS?

07:02.300 --> 07:03.500
RIGHT HERE.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.500
(Meredith) DANIEL GIBSON, 34,

07:18.533 --> 07:20.700
IN FOR
SEXUAL REASSIGNMENT SURGERY,

07:20.733 --> 07:22.067
(Mark) DONNA, NOT DANIEL.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.800
SHE'S BEEN LIVING AS DONNA
FOR TWO YEARS.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.567
COME ON, GREY.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.100
SO ESSENTIALLY TODAY,

07:28.133 --> 07:30.133
WE ARE INVERTING HIS,
UH, HER, UH--

07:30.167 --> 07:31.400
HER PENIS.

07:31.433 --> 07:33.433
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'LL GET IT. (laughs)

07:33.467 --> 07:35.367
YOU KNOW THE STEPS
FOR A VAGINOPLASTY?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.467
NOT EXACTLY.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.300
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GET IN
ON THIS OPERATION TODAY,

07:38.333 --> 07:41.167
YOU BETTER LEARN.
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
TO HIM.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.600
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL.
BETTER THAN I DID
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT.

07:44.633 --> 07:47.233
WE JUST NEED TO RUN
A FEW PRE-OP LABS,

07:47.267 --> 07:48.700
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
IN WORKING ORDER.

07:48.733 --> 07:50.700
AND THEN SURGERY... TODAY?

07:50.733 --> 07:53.500
YEAH. BIG DAY, DONNA.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.200
YOU EXCITED?

07:55.233 --> 07:57.567
EXCITED DOESN'T BEGIN
TO COVER IT.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.700
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.333
THAT IS A NICE-LOOKING
PICNIC BASKET.

08:26.367 --> 08:28.067
AH, THANK YOU.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.800
THE CONCIERGE AT THE HOTEL
PUT IT TOGETHER.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.467
WE GOT CRACKERS, UH, PâTé

08:31.500 --> 08:33.800
AND AN ASSORTMENT
OF SEATTLE SOFT CHEESES.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.767
NO, THANKS.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.300
DUDE, HE BROUGHT SILVERWARE.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.567
(laughs) YOU SHOULD TALK.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.500
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN CAMPING BEFORE?

08:40.533 --> 08:42.433
WHAT?
A T-SHIRT AND SNEAKERS?

08:42.467 --> 08:44.300
HA! YOU'LL FREEZE
YOUR ASS OFF.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.267
SO? I'M WEARING A JACKET.
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.733
DON'T COME CRAWLING TO ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

08:48.767 --> 08:51.300
WHEN YOU WANT TO HUDDLE
FOR WARMTH.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.100
THAT'S
A GOOD-LOOKING TENT, JOE.

08:55.133 --> 08:59.067
UH, YOU AND WALTER
GOT ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

09:00.733 --> 09:03.500
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE SLEEPING
WITH ONE OF THE DOCTORS.

09:03.533 --> 09:06.800
WELL, PRESTON'S ALREADY GOT
O'MALLEY FOR A ROOMMATE,

09:06.833 --> 09:08.367
AND, UM...

09:08.400 --> 09:10.367
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

09:10.400 --> 09:13.667
UM, THOSE OTHER TENTS
ARE PRETTY PUNY.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.133
WELL, WALTER AND I WERE SORT OF
WANTING TO SHARE THIS ONE,

09:17.167 --> 09:19.567
JUST THE TWO OF US.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.767
BUT I GUESS
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO...

09:22.800 --> 09:25.267
CHIEF, I-I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY...

09:25.300 --> 09:26.667
THEY'VE OFFERED, KAREV.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.533
CHIEF,
THEY WANT TO BE ALONE.

09:31.267 --> 09:32.467
(whispering indistinctly)

09:32.500 --> 09:35.400
OH!

09:36.433 --> 09:38.633
SO YOU ARE, UM...
UH, CHIEF.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.267
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.167
MAN LOVE. (chuckles)

09:42.200 --> 09:44.667
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.333
M-MY--MY COUSIN'S GAY,

09:46.367 --> 09:48.200
SO I'M--I'M HIP.

09:48.233 --> 09:51.433
AND "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN,"
AND ALL OF THAT.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.433
UH, WHO'S READY
TO GO FISHING?

09:53.467 --> 09:56.400
UH, ME. ME. I'M READY.
OKAY, YEAH. LET'S GO. OKAY.

09:56.433 --> 09:59.367
FISHING... (mumbles)

09:59.400 --> 10:01.567
GUESS WHAT I'M DOING TODAY.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.100
REMOVING A MAN'S PENIS.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.133
YOU GOT AN S.R.S.?

10:06.167 --> 10:07.367
SERIOUSLY?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.733
HE'S, UH--SHE, SHE--
IS ONE OF SLOAN'S PATIENTS.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.667
OH, GOD.
THAT SHOULD BE ME.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.600
I SHOULD BE TURNING
A PENIS INTO A VAGINA.

10:13.633 --> 10:16.600
THAT SHOULD BE MY PENIS.
I HAVE TO HIDE.

10:16.633 --> 10:19.100
SYDNEY IS MY PEER COUNSELOR.

10:19.133 --> 10:21.400
"HEAL WITH LOVE" SYDNEY.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.067
OH. EW.
EW.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.133
YEAH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
SHADOWING HER

10:25.167 --> 10:26.267
AND DIALOGUING ALL DAY,

10:26.300 --> 10:29.133
UNLESS I CAN COME UP WITH
A GOOD MEDICAL REASON NOT TO.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.100
ANYBODY? ANYTHING?

10:31.133 --> 10:32.767
(toilet flushes)

10:32.800 --> 10:34.700
(nasally) COUPLE OF HOUSES
AND THE DOG.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.533
THAT'S NINE PIECES SO FAR.

10:36.567 --> 10:38.267
I LOVE THE DOG.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.267
I'M ALWAYS THE DOG
WHEN I PLAY MONOPOLY.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.700
(elevator bell dings)

10:45.267 --> 10:48.133
UH, I GOT A PAGE.
JAMIE CARR--

10:48.167 --> 10:50.333
SHE SLIPPED AND FELL
IN THE SHOWER THIS MORNING.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.067
I CAN'T SEE MY OWN FEET.
I... DID THIS.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
OOH, NASTY BREAK.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.500
OH! AH.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.333
SHE HASN'T HAD ANY MEDS
FOR THE PAIN?

10:59.367 --> 11:02.433
SHE REFUSED.
SHE'S TOUGHING IT OUT.
OH, DON'T DO THAT.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.100
DON'T TOUGH IT OUT.
JUST SAY YES.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.067
WELL, THE BABY--

11:06.067 --> 11:09.500
I-I KNOW DR. MONTGOMERY
SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

11:09.533 --> 11:12.267
BUT I'LL SUFFER.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.633
IS HE OKAY? I...

11:13.667 --> 11:16.200
HE WAS KICKING LIKE CRAZY,
AND--AND NOW--

11:16.233 --> 11:18.467
IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT HE'S JUST SLEEPING.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.467
SO... OUR SON SLEEPS.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.733
(chuckles)

11:21.767 --> 11:24.633
HE'S JUST SLEEPING, JAMIE.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.400
DO I NEED A CAST?

11:26.433 --> 11:27.667
DEFINITELY.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.267
BUT FIRST WE NEED
TO STRAIGHTEN THE BONES.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.833
WE'LL JUST PUT YOUR ARM
IN THIS KIND OF FANCY SLING,

11:32.867 --> 11:35.267
AND USE GRAVITY TO HELP
REALIGN THE BONES.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.200
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME
JUST A MOMENT?

11:37.233 --> 11:39.067
I'LL BE--I'VE GOT A...

11:44.633 --> 11:47.400
TRADE YOU?

11:47.433 --> 11:48.633
VICKY.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.667
INSURANCE FORMS.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.500
DONNA GETS HIS SURGERIES,
AND I DO THE FORMS.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.800
SUPER FUN.

11:55.833 --> 11:59.267
WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE
HANDLING THIS REMARKABLY WELL.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.233
WELL, I LEFT AT FIRST...

12:03.267 --> 12:05.533
WHEN SHE...

12:05.567 --> 12:08.767
WHEN HE TOLD ME.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.800
YOU PLAN A LIFE TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW,

12:11.833 --> 12:14.667
KIDS, AND SUDDENLY,
THAT'S ALL OUT THE WINDOW.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.567
SUDDENLY YOUR HUSBAND IS
THIS OTHER GIRL IN YOUR HOUSE

12:17.600 --> 12:21.333
WHO'S BORROWING YOUR EYELINER
AND WAXING HER LEGS.

12:21.367 --> 12:24.633
BUT YOU CAME BACK.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.267
WHY?

12:26.300 --> 12:30.067
HONESTLY, RIGHT NOW
I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.433
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
THE PENIS.

12:42.467 --> 12:45.467
(sniffling)

12:48.133 --> 12:49.300
YOU OKAY?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.767
YEAH, I'M FINE. I'M OKAY.
I'M GOOD.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.133
(laughs and sniffles)

12:53.167 --> 12:55.067
DON'T MAKE ME CLIMB OVER
THIS STALL.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.833
I'LL DO IT,
BUT I'LL BE REALLY PISSED

12:56.867 --> 12:59.767
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW YOU
THAT WELL.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.167
(sniffles)

13:02.200 --> 13:04.400
YOU'RE NOT OKAY.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.167
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHY...

13:08.200 --> 13:09.367
(sniffles) THERE'S NO REASON

13:09.400 --> 13:11.300
THAT THIS SHOULD AFFECT ME
THIS MUCH.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.233
I'M USED TO THIS.
I AM, BUT...

13:13.267 --> 13:15.733
USED TO WHAT?

13:15.767 --> 13:18.133
THAT WOMAN.

13:18.167 --> 13:21.067
YESTERDAY, SHE'S JUST
AS HEALTHY AS CAN BE.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.333
UH, AND TODAY...

13:24.367 --> 13:28.333
TODAY HER BABY'S DEAD.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.367
(sobs)

13:30.400 --> 13:33.467
***

13:41.567 --> 13:43.467
SO, UH...

13:43.500 --> 13:47.267
HOW LONG YOU AND WALTER
BEEN TOGETHER?

13:47.300 --> 13:49.133
TEN YEARS, ON AND OFF.

13:49.167 --> 13:52.067
BUT NOW, DEFINITELY ON.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.100
THINKING ABOUT KIDS.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.067
THAT'S A BIG STEP.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.633
YOU HAVE KIDS?

13:59.067 --> 14:00.567
NO.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.467
OH, I WORK A LOT.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.600
ADELE AND I, W--

14:06.633 --> 14:08.300
WELL, SHE ALWAYS SAID

14:08.333 --> 14:10.233
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO RAISE KIDS ALONE.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.333
WALTER SAYS THE SAME THING.

14:13.367 --> 14:14.767
HE DOES?

14:14.800 --> 14:17.267
WELL, I'M ALWAYS WORKING
AT THE BAR.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.200
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, RIGHT?

14:19.233 --> 14:21.700
IF I'M NOT THERE,
WHO'S GONNA RUN THE PLACE?

14:21.733 --> 14:23.367
EXACTLY.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.800
BUT WALTER...

14:24.833 --> 14:27.600
IF I HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE,
I'LL DO IT.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.500
I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE
WITHOUT HIM, YOU KNOW?

14:30.533 --> 14:33.633
***

14:36.333 --> 14:39.300
VERY NICE, O'MALLEY.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.800
AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH,

14:40.833 --> 14:43.700
MY DAD WOULD TAKE ME
AND MY BROTHERS TO WHITE RIVER.

14:43.733 --> 14:46.067
WELL, YOUR DAD
TAUGHT YOU WELL.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.733
HOW ARE YOU AND, UH,
DR. TORRES DOING THESE DAYS?

14:48.767 --> 14:49.767
GOOD.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.733
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET,
BUT WE ARE.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.633
EXCELLENT, EVEN.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.367
FOR A WHILE, UH,

14:55.400 --> 14:58.433
SHE WANTED, I DON'T KNOW,
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMMITMENT,

14:58.467 --> 15:01.100
AND I JUST DIDN'T FEEL

15:01.133 --> 15:03.667
THAT I WAS RE--
NOW I AM, THOUGH.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.067
SO YOU'RE STEPPING UP?
I'M STEPPING UP.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.067
YOU KNEW, RIGHT,

15:07.067 --> 15:10.100
WHEN IT WAS THE RIGHT TIME
WITH YOU AND CRISTINA?

15:10.133 --> 15:12.600
RIGHT.

15:12.633 --> 15:15.700
***

15:15.733 --> 15:17.533
YOU OKAY?

15:17.567 --> 15:19.467
ABSOLUTELY.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.167
BECAUSE, UH--
WE'RE HERE TO FISH,
REMEMBER?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.067
RIGHT.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.667
I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN GET
A BETTER BITE DOWNSTREAM.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.333
OKAY.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.800
(Mark) I'M SORRY, DONNA,
THE LABS DON'T LIE.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.367
BREAST CANCER?
I'M SORRY.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.600
I'M REALLY...

15:39.633 --> 15:42.200
THE NEEDLE ASPIRATION
SHOWED ABNORMAL CELLS

15:42.233 --> 15:43.767
IN YOUR BREAST TISSUE.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.067
RARE, BUT IT HAPPENS.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.833
WELL, SO THE HORMONES
I'VE BEEN TAKING

15:47.867 --> 15:49.600
ARE ESSENTIALLY
GIVING ME CANCER?

15:49.633 --> 15:52.600
YES. THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO STOP THE HORMONE THERAPY

15:52.633 --> 15:54.100
AND START THE TREATMENT.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.500
OR THE CANCER
WILL GET WORSE.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.267
THE OPERATION?

16:01.300 --> 16:03.300
THERE'D REALLY BE NO POINT.

16:03.333 --> 16:06.133
ONCE WE STOP THE HORMONES,
YOUR BREASTS WILL SHRINK,

16:06.167 --> 16:09.667
YOUR FACIAL HAIR
WILL GROW BACK.
SHE'LL BECOME A MAN AGAIN.

16:09.700 --> 16:13.533
WHAT IF I DO THE OPERATION,
KEEP TAKING THE HORMONES?

16:13.567 --> 16:15.367
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.600
DONNA YOU REALLY WANT
TO TREAT THIS NOW

16:17.633 --> 16:20.067
WHILE IT'S STILL IN ITS
EARLY STAGES.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.300
SO IF I KEEP TAKING
THE HORMONES...

16:22.333 --> 16:23.800
YOU'D BE FEEDING THE CANCER.

16:23.833 --> 16:27.067
I COULD DIE?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.200
ARE YOU SAYING
IF I BECOME A WOMAN,

16:29.233 --> 16:32.367
I COULD DIE?

16:32.400 --> 16:36.467
***

16:38.600 --> 16:42.533
THEY ARE A HAPPY COUPLE.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.067
LOOK AT THEM.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.200
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

16:46.233 --> 16:49.233
THEY SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING.

16:49.267 --> 16:52.267
(Addison)
HAPPY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE...

16:52.300 --> 16:55.067
HAPPY THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.400
I GOTTA GO TELL 'EM.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.600
WAIT. (sighs)

16:59.633 --> 17:03.533
THE MOMENT YOU TELL THEM,
THEY WON'T BE HAPPY ANYMORE.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.567
GIVE 'EM A FEW MORE MINUTES.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.433
LET 'EM BE HAPPY...

17:08.467 --> 17:11.367
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.500
***

17:15.533 --> 17:17.200
SO YOU'RE GETTIN' BACK
WITH CALLIE?

17:17.233 --> 17:18.667
YEAH.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.333
TRUST ME, MAN,

17:20.367 --> 17:23.400
I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THAT.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.733
REALLY?

17:24.767 --> 17:27.167
REALLY.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.133
I GUESS WHEN I GET BACK,
I'M GONNA TELL HER

17:30.167 --> 17:32.067
THAT WE SHOULDN'T
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE,

17:32.100 --> 17:33.767
AND THEN WHEN SHE ASKS WHY,
I'M JUST GONNA SAY,

17:33.800 --> 17:35.400
"WELL, ALEX KAREV THINKS

17:35.433 --> 17:37.833
OUR RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA."

17:37.867 --> 17:39.767
YOU THINK THAT'LL DO
THE TRICK?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.300
FINE. SUIT YOURSELF.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.733
THIS WAS MY CAMPING TRIP.
I WAS GONNA COME ALONE.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.633
SO WHY DID YOU INVITE ME?
BECAUSE...

17:51.667 --> 17:53.567
IT'S A GUY TRIP, YOU KNOW?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.500
MOUNTAIN MEN.

17:57.333 --> 18:00.600
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS,
DO YOU?

18:00.633 --> 18:02.133
OF COURSE I HAVE FRIENDS.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.267
GUY FRIENDS?

18:03.300 --> 18:06.067
YES.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.800
I JUST NEED PEACE...
SPACE.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.633
I HAVE A RIGHT TO SPACE.

18:13.667 --> 18:17.567
AND YOU GO AND INVITE
HALF THE HOSPITAL.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.600
THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE
GUY FRIENDS.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.267
THERE YOU ARE.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.233
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.433
OH, DR. YANG NEEDED SOME HELP
WITH THIS PATIENT.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.767
SHE NEEDED SOME HELP.
(chuckles)
OH, WELL...

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
PATIENT CARE
ALWAYS COMES FIRST.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.067
SO...

18:38.600 --> 18:40.633
UH, WHAT...

18:40.667 --> 18:42.800
OH, I'LL JUST WAIT.
WAIT?

18:42.833 --> 18:45.500
YEAH, FOR YOU TO FINISH,
AND THEN WE'LL DIALOGUE.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.300
OKAY.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.400
SO... WHAT HAPPENS
WITH DONNA NOW?

18:54.433 --> 18:55.800
SHE GOES BACK TO BEING

18:55.833 --> 18:58.833
AN UNHAPPY MAN
WHO'S STUCK WITH A PENIS.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.200
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US
OUT THERE.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.733
YOU'RE UNHAPPY
WITH YOUR PENIS?

19:02.767 --> 19:05.333
I COULD BE
A LOT LESS UNHAPPY.

19:05.367 --> 19:08.400
MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST
THAT HE'S TAKING SOME SPACE.

19:08.433 --> 19:11.167
MAYBE... YOU TWO
AREN'T MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.333
LOOK, DEREK...

19:14.367 --> 19:17.067
ON THE OUTSIDE,
HE HOLDS IT ALL TOGETHER,

19:17.067 --> 19:19.133
BUT HE'S DAMAGED GOODS,
MEREDITH.

19:19.167 --> 19:22.333
IT'S MY FAULT.
I DAMAGED HIM, MAYBE FOREVER.

19:22.367 --> 19:25.367
YOU REALLY WANT TO DRINK
FROM A POISONED WELL?

19:26.700 --> 19:29.567
DR. SLOAN...
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.067
DONNA SAYS SHE WANTS TO
GO THROUGH WITH THE OPERATION.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.600
JOE AND WALTER GOT TIRED
OF NOT CATCHING ANY FISH.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.667
THEY WENT FOR A HIKE.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.067
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.567
JOE AND WALTER?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.767
OH, NO, NO, NO.
JOE AND WALTER ARE GREAT.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.600
I MEAN THAT WE HAVEN'T
CAUGHT ANY FISH.

19:50.633 --> 19:52.133
ANY THEORIES?

19:52.167 --> 19:54.333
JUST ONE--FISH GENERALLY
DON'T LIKE TO GO

19:54.367 --> 19:57.200
WHERE THERE'S
A LOT OF NOISE.

19:57.233 --> 19:59.633
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
GOING ON WITH BURKE?

19:59.667 --> 20:00.700
NO.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.667
'CAUSE BEFORE,
I THOUGHT I SAW--

20:02.700 --> 20:04.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:04.267 --> 20:06.800
YOU DON'T USE BAIT
WHEN YOU'RE CASTING.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.333
IT'S GONNA FALL OFF
BEFORE IT HITS THE WATER.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.500
HERE. WHAT ARE YOU--
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

20:11.533 --> 20:13.200
WHAT YOU WANT TO--
SHE'S SLEEPING
WITH SLOAN, DUDE.

20:13.233 --> 20:14.467
WHAT?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.667
CALLIE.
SHE'S SLEEPING WITH SLOAN.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.333
NO, SHE'S NOT.

20:19.367 --> 20:22.300
TORRES IS DOING SLOAN.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.767
YOU BETTER TAKE THAT BACK.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.667
(Derek) YEAH, PEOPLE CHATTING,
LAUGHING, MOVING AROUND,

20:30.700 --> 20:32.833
THAT SORT OF THING?
THAT SORT OF THING

20:32.867 --> 20:35.500
LET'S THE FISH KNOW
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE.

20:35.533 --> 20:37.267
THAT'S THE THEORY.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.067
SO I INVITED OTHER PEOPLE?
I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S NOT A FRAT PARTY.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.267
(George) TAKE IT BACK!
NOTHING TO TAKE BACK.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.800
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

20:44.833 --> 20:47.300
BREAK IT UP! BREAK IT UP!

20:51.067 --> 20:53.200
I DON'T CONDONE FIGHTING.
I DON'T LIKE FIGHTING.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.733
I THINK IT IS POINTLESS
AND FOOLISH.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.667
BUT YOU TWO IDIOTS
SEEM DETERMINED

20:57.700 --> 20:59.600
TO BEAT THE HELL
OUT OF EACH OTHER.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.100
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,

21:01.133 --> 21:03.133
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
BY MY RULES.

21:03.167 --> 21:04.500
RULES?

21:04.533 --> 21:07.400
YES, O'MALLEY, RULES,
TO HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR HANDS

21:07.433 --> 21:10.200
SO YOU DON'T DO IRREPARABLE
DAMAGE TO THEM...
(whispers) YOU'RE DEAD.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.667
DAMAGE THAT WOULD END
YOUR CAREERS

21:12.700 --> 21:14.400
BEFORE THEY EVEN STARTED.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.367
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE'RE
GONNA DO OPEN-HANDED COMBAT.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.200
A SLAP FIGHT?
A SLAP FIGHT?

21:18.233 --> 21:21.400
OPEN-HANDED COMBAT. THERE WILL
BE NO SCRATCHING, NO BITING.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.533
ALSO...
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
KAREV IS GONNA KILL HIM.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.733
NOT NECESSARILY.
(Richard) NO PUNCHING,
NO KICKING,

21:25.767 --> 21:28.067
NO WRESTLING MOVES
OF ANY KIND.

21:28.067 --> 21:31.367
NOW ANY QUESTIONS?
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE US
WITH MUCH.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.733
ALL RIGHT.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.767
***

21:34.800 --> 21:36.533
O'MALLEY'S A SCRAPPER.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.433
A SCRAPPER?
HE'S GONNA DESTROY HIM.
HE'S TOUGHER THAN HE LOOKS--

21:39.467 --> 21:41.533
SILENT, BUT DEADLY.
(Alex) GIVE UP ALREADY, MAN.
I'M GONNA KILL YA.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.667
THIS IS IMMATURE AND STUPID.
(George) I'VE ALREADY KICKED
YOUR ASS ONCE.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.133
I THINK YOU'D AGREE WITH ME.
(Alex) SUCKER PUNCHES
DON'T COUNT.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.833
THEY'RE LETTING OFF
SOME STEAM.
(George) YOU'RE GONNA BE
SO SORRY.

21:47.867 --> 21:49.767
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GUY FRIENDS.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.667
YEAH, THIS IS WHY
I SHOULD'VE COME ALONE.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.600
I'VE WANTED THIS
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.800
I'VE WAITED FOREVER.
I'M NOT STOPPING NOW.

21:56.833 --> 21:59.400
DONNA, LISTEN TO ME--
IF YOU DON'T DO
THE OPERATION,

21:59.433 --> 22:01.567
I'M GONNA GO TO NEW YORK
AND FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.467
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY HARD
TIME FINDING A SURGEON--
I'LL FIND ONE.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.400
(Mark) DONNA, I'M TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

22:06.433 --> 22:09.667
AS A MAN.
I AM NOT A MAN.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.100
I'LL FIGHT THE CANCER.
I'LL JUST FIGHT IT AS A WOMAN.

22:13.133 --> 22:16.067
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
WAKE UP, DANIEL!

22:16.067 --> 22:19.733
MY NAME IS DONNA.

22:22.633 --> 22:25.500
I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY
AND WATCH YOU KILL YOURSELF.

22:25.533 --> 22:28.133
(scoffs)

22:36.533 --> 22:39.067
I NEED VICKY TO LOVE ME.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.400
BUT I NEED HER TO LOVE... ME.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.600
(Jamie) OH, MY GOD.

22:50.633 --> 22:52.533
PLEASE, TELL ME IT'S GONNA
STOP HURTING SOON.

22:52.567 --> 22:54.233
YOU'RE ALMOST DONE.

22:54.267 --> 22:57.067
(man) WHEN OUR SON'S 15,
AND HE'S YELLING AT YOU

22:57.100 --> 22:58.200
THAT YOU NEVER DID
ANYTHING FOR HIM,

22:58.233 --> 23:01.567
YOU CAN GUILT HIM
WITH THE WRIST.
(Jamie laughs)

23:01.600 --> 23:03.100
(man chuckles)

23:05.533 --> 23:07.800
TED, JAMIE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU...

23:10.767 --> 23:12.600
ABOUT THE BABY.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.633
DR. MONTGOMERY...

23:18.800 --> 23:21.133
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

23:21.167 --> 23:24.567
I WON'T BELIEVE IT
UNLESS YOU SAY IT.

23:24.600 --> 23:29.067
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

23:40.367 --> 23:42.267
THANKS FOR THIS, IZZIE.
THANK YOU.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.167
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED.
"GOOD DEED"?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
YOU'RE MAKING ME DIG
THROUGH CRAP.

23:47.133 --> 23:50.533
IT'S NOT LIKE I ASKED HER
TO SPEND THE DAY WITH ME.
(Sydney) OH.

23:50.567 --> 23:51.733
OOH-WEE.

23:51.767 --> 23:54.200
HOW'S IT GOIN' IN THERE?
ANY LUCK?

23:57.467 --> 23:59.367
OKAY, I CAN'T HAVE
THAT GRINNING PUPPET HEAD

23:59.400 --> 24:01.167
STARE AT ME ANOTHER SECOND,
SO JUST GO.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.533
CRISTINA.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.467
HEY, THIS IS MY CRAP.
THIS IS MY CRAP.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.233
BAILEY ASSIGNED ME THIS CRAP.
YOU GET SYDNEY.

24:07.267 --> 24:09.333
FINE. COME ON, SYDNEY.
WE CAN GO.

24:09.367 --> 24:11.267
OKEYDOKEY, SMOKEY.
(laughs)

24:11.300 --> 24:13.067
(Izzie chuckles)

24:20.633 --> 24:23.267
MAN, I THOUGHT MY BROTHER
AND I HAD PROBLEMS,

24:23.300 --> 24:24.500
BUT YOU TWO ARE MORONS.

24:24.533 --> 24:27.067
OKAY, WELL, SWALLOWING
MONOPOLY PIECES

24:27.067 --> 24:28.400
WASN'T EXACTLY
A GENIUS MOVE.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.767
YOU COULD'VE
REALLY HURT YOURSELF.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.300
I DIDN'T, DID I?

24:31.333 --> 24:32.800
NOW MY MOM'S
GONNA MAKE MY BROTHER

24:32.833 --> 24:35.200
LET ME PLAY
ALL THE MONOPOLY I WANT.

24:35.233 --> 24:36.600
I GET TO PLAY.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.167
IT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,
GETTING TO PLAY.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.133
AND THAT MAKES YOU SMART?

24:40.167 --> 24:43.700
YOU'RE FISHING THROUGH MY POOP.
HOW SMART ARE YOU?

24:43.733 --> 24:46.633
***

24:46.667 --> 24:48.667
TAKE IT BACK.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.467
NOTHING TO TAKE BACK.
THAT'S RIGHT, KAREV.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.833
WHATEVER IT WAS,
DON'T TAKE IT BACK.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.733
(Derek) YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY THEY'RE FIGHTING.

24:54.767 --> 24:57.333
(Preston) ARMS UP, O'MALLEY.
DON'T DROP YOUR ARMS.

24:57.367 --> 24:59.300
***

24:59.333 --> 25:01.100
HEY, HEY, NO WRESTLING.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.433
NO WRESTLING.
COME ON, COME ON.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.333
THIS IS STUPID.
GEORGE IS DEFENDING
HIS HONOR.

25:05.367 --> 25:08.267
KAREV SAID THAT, UH, SLOAN'S
BEEN SLEEPING WITH TORRES.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.633
HE WHAT?

25:09.667 --> 25:11.567
O'MALLEY, ARMS UP.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.533
***

25:14.567 --> 25:16.500
(grunting)

25:16.533 --> 25:20.067
***

25:23.167 --> 25:25.100
(grunting)

25:25.133 --> 25:26.433
NEXT TIME,

25:26.467 --> 25:29.067
WE'RE NOT GOING CAMPING
WITH STRAIGHT GUYS.

25:29.100 --> 25:31.067
OH, WATCH--OH, NO. GOD.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.067
SO BASICALLY,
YOU'RE GETTING PAID

25:41.100 --> 25:43.833
TO LOOK AT PENISES ALL DAY.
I'M STUDYING FOR McSTEAMY'S
REASSIGNMENT SURGERY.

25:43.867 --> 25:46.167
YOU LIKE McSTEAMY.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.367
YES.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.200
I MEAN, NO.
NO, NOT LIKE THAT.

25:51.233 --> 25:53.133
JUST... YOU KNOW,
HE THINKS I'M BETTER OFF

25:53.167 --> 25:54.333
WITHOUT DEREK'S BAGGAGE.

25:54.367 --> 25:56.267
THINKS THERE'S
TOO MUCH HISTORY THERE.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.200
MAYBE IN HIS OWN SICK,
TWISTED WAY,

25:58.233 --> 26:00.833
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

26:00.867 --> 26:02.600
PROTECT YOU?

26:02.633 --> 26:04.067
MAYBE.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.500
HEY, UM...

26:09.533 --> 26:11.567
UH, WHEN YOUR M-MOTHER
WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED

26:11.600 --> 26:14.133
WITH ALZHEIMER'S...

26:14.167 --> 26:16.100
UH, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYONE?

26:16.133 --> 26:18.067
UH, SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

26:18.067 --> 26:19.400
WHY?

26:19.433 --> 26:22.067
SO YOU THINK IT WAS RIGHT
TO KEEP HER SECRET?

26:22.067 --> 26:23.533
YES. WHY?

26:23.567 --> 26:24.767
EVEN IF IT MEANT

26:24.800 --> 26:27.667
YOU HAD TO FISH CRAP
OUT OF A TOILET ALL DAY

26:27.700 --> 26:30.567
AND PROBABLY
FOR YEARS TO COME?

26:30.600 --> 26:33.267
OKAY, REWIND.
START AT THE BEGINNING.
(pager beeps)

26:33.300 --> 26:34.700
WHOSE SECRET
ARE YOU KEEPING?

26:34.733 --> 26:37.467
OH, WAIT.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.267
(moaning)
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

26:40.300 --> 26:43.167
HE WAS FINE ONE MINUTE,
AND THEN HE JUST--

26:43.200 --> 26:44.267
ERIC, LAY DOWN, OKAY?

26:44.300 --> 26:47.300
(groaning)

26:47.333 --> 26:49.233
(Cristina)
OH, HIS ABDOMEN IS RIGID.

26:49.267 --> 26:53.067
THERE'S BLOOD IN THE VOMIT.
HE'S PERFED. PAGE BAILEY.

26:53.067 --> 26:54.600
(Preston)
THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD,

26:54.633 --> 26:57.533
BUT, UH, IT DIDN'T PENETRATE
THE GALEA.
(Joe) IS THAT A GOOD THING?

26:57.567 --> 26:59.500
(Derek) YEAH, IT MEANS WE
DON'T HAVE TO DO DEEP STITCHES.

26:59.533 --> 27:02.367
YOU'RE USING A FISHING HOOK?
AH, DON'T WORRY.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.333
WE STERILIZED IT.
ALSO CLIPPED OFF THE BARB.

27:04.367 --> 27:06.333
IT'S GOOD AS A NEEDLE.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.667
ALL RIGHT, WOUND'S CLEAN.
(Richard) MM-HMM.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.600
JUST KEEP SOME PRESSURE
ON THERE, WILL YOU, CHIEF?
GOT IT.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.067
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA DO
SOME STITCHES NOW,

27:12.100 --> 27:14.700
ALL RIGHT, WALTER?
IS IT GONNA HURT?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.367
YES.
IT'S OKAY.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.633
(spray can hisses)

27:18.667 --> 27:20.433
KAREV, YOU WANNA SEW HIM UP?

27:20.467 --> 27:23.467
OH, NO. NO. NO, FORGET IT.
I WANT AN ATTENDING.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.433
(Alex) THANKS, DUDE.
WE'RE DOING SOME KIND
OF CRAZY MacGYVER SURGERY

27:26.467 --> 27:27.433
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS.

27:27.467 --> 27:29.600
I WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY GUY, OKAY? NO OFFENSE.

27:33.067 --> 27:37.400
DON'T WORRY. DR. BURKE'S
REALLY GOOD AT DOING THIS.

27:38.767 --> 27:41.067
WELL, YOU ARE, RIGHT?

27:42.733 --> 27:45.067
RIGHT.

27:47.433 --> 27:51.167
(Walter groaning)

27:51.200 --> 27:53.333
THERE'S STILL
A LITTLE BLEEDING THERE.

27:54.467 --> 27:57.067
(Richard) HOLD ON, WALTER.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.567
YOU GOT IT?

28:11.700 --> 28:14.733
I ALWAYS HAVE IT.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.800
(clears throat)

28:23.833 --> 28:26.200
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

28:26.233 --> 28:31.067
HE IS MY PATIENT.
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM ALL DAY.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.267
IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT
I CAN GET IN ON THIS SURGERY,

28:34.300 --> 28:35.200
I'D REALLY--

28:35.233 --> 28:37.300
WHY'D YOU ERASE
MY NAME FROM THE BOARD?

28:37.333 --> 28:39.267
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.267
YOU REALLY WANNA GO
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH ME ON THIS?

28:41.300 --> 28:42.800
YOU REALLY WANT THAT?

28:42.833 --> 28:46.167
RIGHT NOW, THIS SECOND,
IN THIS MOMENT,

28:59.467 --> 29:01.400
(Izzie clears throat)

29:01.433 --> 29:04.833
SO TELL ME ABOUT DENNY.

29:04.867 --> 29:07.133
WHAT?

29:07.167 --> 29:10.300
YEAH, IT HELPS TO, UH...

29:10.333 --> 29:12.067
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.767
SO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN--

29:13.800 --> 29:15.467
OKAY, WE ARE DONE HERE.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.067
IZZIE, REALLY...

29:18.100 --> 29:19.567
IT HELPS TO SHARE.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.500
NO. I DON'T WANT
TO SHARE WITH YOU.

29:22.533 --> 29:24.433
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN
DOING ALL DAY?

29:24.467 --> 29:25.500
SIFTING THROUGH FECES.

29:25.533 --> 29:28.067
I WOULD RATHER SIFT THROUGH
FECES THAN TALK TO YOU.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.300
AND NOW YOU BRING UP DENNY
LIKE YOU WANT ME TO--

29:30.333 --> 29:32.067
TO GOSSIP WITH YOU.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.833
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THIS--
THIS MUST BE DIFFICULT.

29:34.867 --> 29:37.733
YOU UNDERSTAND? REALLY? WHAT,
YOU CUT SOMEONE'S LVAD WIRE?

29:37.767 --> 29:40.500
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH A MAN
AND HE DIED?
WELL, NO, BUT--

29:40.533 --> 29:43.600
THEN HOW IN THE HELL
COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW?

29:47.300 --> 29:49.200
(Mark) GREY,
WHAT'S OUR NEXT STEP?

29:49.233 --> 29:50.433
CONTINUE THE PRIMARY INCISION

29:50.467 --> 29:53.533
OF THE VENTRAL SIDE
OF THE SHAFT.

29:53.567 --> 29:57.700
I AM SURPRISED YOU AGREED
TO DO THE SURGERY.

29:57.733 --> 30:00.600
PEOPLE DON'T COME TO ME
TO FIX WHAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.733
THEY COME TO ME TO FIX
WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.600
IF THAT MEANS GIVING SOMEONE
A STRAIGHTER NOSE

30:05.633 --> 30:07.800
OR BIGGER BREASTS OR...

30:07.833 --> 30:11.400
IF THAT HELPS
A PERSON GET BY...

30:11.433 --> 30:15.267
I DON'T RUN. I DON'T HIDE.
I DON'T TAKE SPACE.

30:15.300 --> 30:19.367
***

30:23.833 --> 30:26.700
WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DIDN'T START IT.

30:26.733 --> 30:29.133
KAREV.
WHAT? I JUST CAME OUT HERE
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

30:29.167 --> 30:31.767
THEN THE GUY GETS ALL OVER ME
ABOUT WHAT I'M WEARING.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.267
HE JUST RUBS ME
THE WRONG WAY.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.367
YOU'RE ON A CAMPING TRIP.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.667
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENJOYING
THE GREAT OUTDOORS.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.600
YOU KNOW I GREW UP
IN A BAR?

30:39.633 --> 30:41.433
LITERALLY IN A BAR.

30:41.467 --> 30:44.333
MY DAD WAS ALWAYS DOING
ONE OF TWO THINGS IN THERE--

30:44.367 --> 30:46.667
PLAYING MUSIC OR DRINKING.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.033
DUDE NEVER EVEN TOOK ME
TO THE PARK.

30:50.067 --> 30:51.800
I JUST FIGURED
THIS WAS MY CHANCE

30:51.833 --> 30:53.433
TO GET OUT WITH THE GUYS.

30:53.467 --> 30:55.633
THE ONE TIME I TRY...

30:55.667 --> 30:59.100
YOU WANTED TO BE
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.300
THEY'RE A HAPPY COUPLE.

31:02.333 --> 31:05.367
YEAH.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.067
I MISS MY WIFE.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.200
***

31:12.233 --> 31:14.433
YOU HAVE HIGH STANDARDS.

31:14.467 --> 31:15.800
(chuckles)

31:17.400 --> 31:20.333
YOUR STANDARDS ARE TOO HIGH.

31:20.367 --> 31:24.233
YOU...
MAKE PEOPLE OUT TO BE...

31:24.267 --> 31:26.400
AND PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

31:26.433 --> 31:29.200
YOUR STANDARDS ARE TOO HIGH.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.433
YOU SEE A FLAW, YOU ATTACK.

31:33.233 --> 31:35.300
WAIT, WAIT.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.067
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT, UH,

31:37.067 --> 31:38.800
IF CRISTINA
DID SOMETHING LIKE--

31:38.833 --> 31:41.567
CRISTINA AND I ARE A TEAM.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.533
WE ARE A TEAM.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.467
YOU'RE EITHER PART OF A TEAM

31:45.500 --> 31:49.333
OR YOU PLAY ALONE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

31:49.367 --> 31:52.367
***

31:56.467 --> 31:58.067
(groans)

31:58.067 --> 31:59.100
GOOD. PUSH, JAMIE.

31:59.133 --> 32:02.167
(Jamie groans)

32:02.200 --> 32:04.633
OKAY...

32:04.667 --> 32:07.700
I NEED YOU TO PUSH
ONE MORE TIME, JAMIE. TED.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.600
(mouths words)
(sobs)

32:09.633 --> 32:11.400
ONE MORE TIME. PUSH.

32:11.433 --> 32:12.367

32:12.400 --> 32:14.067
(Addison) PUSH.

32:14.867 --> 32:16.233
PUSH.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.167
PUSH. GOOD.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.433
WE GOT IT.

32:19.467 --> 32:22.667

32:22.700 --> 32:25.700
***

32:34.733 --> 32:36.633
OH.

32:36.667 --> 32:39.267
OH.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.233
(Jamie and Ted sobbing)

32:42.267 --> 32:45.267
***

32:49.767 --> 32:52.633
(Jamie sobs)

32:57.267 --> 33:00.500
***

33:08.667 --> 33:11.400
SO THAT MARK SLOAN...

33:11.433 --> 33:12.767
HE'S BAD NEWS.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.567
AH, HE'S A CANCER.
HE INFECTS EVERYBODY.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.267
WHAT ARE WE, THREE HOURS
OUT OF SEATTLE?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.067
AND STILL...
HE INFECTS EVERYTHING.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.233
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT

33:21.267 --> 33:24.133
IF I JUST GOT AWAY
FOR A WHILE BY MYSELF,

33:24.167 --> 33:27.133
I'D GET SOME ANSWERS,
GET A FRESH START.

33:27.167 --> 33:29.733
FRESH STARTS--
NO SUCH THING.

33:29.767 --> 33:33.400
ANY OTHER WORDS
OF WISDOM THERE, CHIEF?

33:33.433 --> 33:35.467
I'M LIVING IN A HOTEL.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.400
I BUY MOST OF MY CLOTHES
FROM THE HOTEL GIFT SHOP,

33:38.433 --> 33:41.167
AND MY WIFE WON'T SPEAK TO ME.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.367
(Preston)
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.267
I CAME OUT HERE FOR
THE SAME REASONS YOU DID.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.067
I HAVE NO WISDOM.
THERE IS NO WISDOM HERE.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.767
MM. SO IN OTHER WORDS...

33:51.800 --> 33:54.767
WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.467
(Preston) YES.
(Richard) YES.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.067
WHO WANTS TO GO HOME?

33:58.067 --> 34:01.067
***

34:14.167 --> 34:17.167
***

34:32.267 --> 34:34.200
I LOST A KID....

34:34.233 --> 34:36.700
MY FIRST YEAR.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.700
IT WAS MY FAULT.

34:38.733 --> 34:42.433
AND I JUST COULDN'T...

34:42.467 --> 34:43.667
SO I HAD A BREAKDOWN.

34:43.700 --> 34:46.667
THEY GAVE ME TIME OFF,
AND WHEN I CAME BACK,

34:46.700 --> 34:48.600
I PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE,

34:48.633 --> 34:51.167
AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT
I WAS FINE.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.567
I LOST A KID.

34:55.300 --> 34:58.167
IT COMES IN WAVES, IZZIE.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.367
THERE'S A LULL,

34:59.400 --> 35:02.233
AND THEN...
ANOTHER WAVE HITS YOU.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.233
I WASN'T TRYING TO PRY.

35:04.267 --> 35:06.167
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

35:06.200 --> 35:09.500
THAT... IT'S OKAY
NOT TO BE FINE S-SOMETIMES.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.500
I MISS HIM.

35:13.533 --> 35:15.733
ALL THE TIME, I MISS HIM.

35:15.767 --> 35:18.367
IT'S NOT WAVES, IT'S CONSTANT,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.767
ALL THE TIME.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.500
AND I WALK THROUGH THE DOORS

35:22.533 --> 35:24.233
OF THIS HOSPITAL,

35:24.267 --> 35:26.267
AND I WANT TO BE HERE,
I DO.

35:26.300 --> 35:29.067
BUT I...

35:29.067 --> 35:30.700
I DON'T KNOW...

35:30.733 --> 35:32.633
IF I CAN BE A SURGEON AGAIN,

35:32.667 --> 35:35.667
AND I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
BECAUSE IT SCARES ME TOO MUCH.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.567
OKAY?

35:39.267 --> 35:41.433
OKAY.

35:46.267 --> 35:48.100
YOU CAME BACK.

35:48.133 --> 35:50.100
I WAS HEADING HOME.

35:50.133 --> 35:52.067
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE AIRPORT,

35:52.067 --> 35:53.600
AND THEN...

35:53.633 --> 35:56.067
YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED BEFORE

35:56.100 --> 35:57.833
WHY I CAME BACK
THE FIRST TIME.

35:57.867 --> 36:01.267
YOU KNOW,
I TRIED NOT TO.

36:01.300 --> 36:04.133
I WENT ON DATES.

36:04.167 --> 36:06.067
I HAD A LOT
OF GREAT FIRST DATES

36:06.100 --> 36:09.333
WITH... GUYS WHO WERE
PLANNING TO STAY GUYS.

36:09.367 --> 36:10.700
(chuckles)

36:10.733 --> 36:13.200
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A GREAT DATE,

36:13.233 --> 36:17.500
AND YOU WANT TO GO AND TELL
YOUR BEST FRIEND ABOUT IT.

36:17.533 --> 36:19.667
AND MY BEST FRIEND
IS DANIEL.

36:19.700 --> 36:23.467
DONNA.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.767
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A FEW BAD DATES, AND...

36:29.633 --> 36:33.100
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

36:33.133 --> 36:36.133
SHE KNOWS ME. SHE LOVES ME.

36:36.167 --> 36:39.500
SHE'S... MY HUSBAND.

36:43.433 --> 36:47.533
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S DONNA,

36:47.567 --> 36:50.267
EVEN WHEN SHE HURTS ME,

36:50.300 --> 36:52.367
EVEN WHEN I HATE HER.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.433
***

36:54.467 --> 36:57.333
SHE'S WHO YOU WANT
TO TALK TO.

36:57.367 --> 37:00.400
***

37:00.433 --> 37:03.400
NOT ALL WOUNDS
ARE SUPERFICIAL.

37:05.267 --> 37:07.533
SO...

37:07.567 --> 37:09.600
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH SLOAN.

37:09.633 --> 37:11.267
(sighs)

37:11.300 --> 37:13.200
WAS.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.400
ME, TOO. WAS.

37:15.433 --> 37:19.267
WHICH IS JUST A HAILSTORM
OF SELF-LOATHING

37:19.300 --> 37:20.500
AND MISERY.

37:20.533 --> 37:21.467
(laughs)

37:21.500 --> 37:23.167
YEAH. (laughs)

37:23.200 --> 37:25.600
(laughs)

37:25.633 --> 37:26.567
(sighs)

37:26.600 --> 37:28.233
HEY, YOU WANT TO, UM...

37:28.267 --> 37:30.767
GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

37:30.800 --> 37:33.667
(pager beeps)

37:33.700 --> 37:37.500
***

37:37.533 --> 37:39.667
SOME OTHER TIME THEN.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.367
DEFINITELY.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.267
***

37:45.300 --> 37:49.133
MOST WOUNDS RUN DEEPER
THAN WE CAN IMAGINE.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.067
HE'LL MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.

37:51.100 --> 37:55.067
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM
WITH THE NAKED EYE.

37:55.067 --> 37:58.833
***

37:58.867 --> 38:01.267
YOU'RE BACK.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.567
YES.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.233
(sighs)

38:04.267 --> 38:06.433
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

38:08.267 --> 38:11.133
ME, TOO.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.100
***

38:14.133 --> 38:16.167
GEORGE, WE NEED TO TALK.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.700
YEAH, I THINK WE DO.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.633
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAD,
GEORGE.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.567
MY DAD?

38:21.600 --> 38:24.667
AND THEN THERE ARE THE WOUNDS
THAT TAKE US BY SURPRISE.

38:24.700 --> 38:28.533
***

38:29.633 --> 38:31.533
(Mark) SO...

38:31.567 --> 38:34.133
THIS COULD BE JUST A DRINK,

38:34.167 --> 38:36.133
OR THIS COULD BE
MORE THAN A DRINK.

38:36.167 --> 38:39.133
I CANNOT START SOMETHING
WITH YOU.
YOU COULD.

38:39.167 --> 38:41.067
(sighs)

38:41.100 --> 38:43.433
START OVER, MEREDITH.

38:43.467 --> 38:46.067
START FRESH.

38:46.067 --> 38:49.467
***

38:49.500 --> 38:50.700
(pager beeps)

38:50.733 --> 38:53.067
SAVED BY THE BELL.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.567
(inhales deeply)

38:54.600 --> 38:57.367
OH.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.400
ORDER ME ANOTHER BEER.

38:59.433 --> 39:02.333

39:14.433 --> 39:16.500
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:16.533 --> 39:19.267
WELL, WE MET AT THIS BAR.
YOU REMEMBER?

39:19.300 --> 39:20.767
WE MET, AND WE--

39:20.800 --> 39:23.133
WELL, YOU SAID, UH,
"I'M JUST A GIRL."

39:23.167 --> 39:25.067
I SAID, "I'M JUST A GUY."

39:25.100 --> 39:26.800
AND WE STARTED THIS THING.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.167
WE STARTED THIS THING.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.167
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME--

39:30.200 --> 39:32.767
THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WIFE.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.400
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.533
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME.

39:39.567 --> 39:42.200
I WANT YOU TO KNOW ME.

39:42.233 --> 39:45.233
I WANT TO START OVER
FROM THE BEGINNING.

SO, HI.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.333
DEREK SHEPHERD.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.533
YOU WALKED AWAY.

39:54.567 --> 39:56.100
AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

39:56.133 --> 39:58.067
THERE'S TOO MUCH WATER
UNDER THE THING

39:58.067 --> 40:00.333
OR WHATEVER.

40:00.367 --> 40:03.133
MEREDITH...

40:03.167 --> 40:06.100
PLEASE.

40:06.133 --> 40:08.833
THE TRICK WITH ANY KIND
OF WOUND OR DISEASE

40:08.867 --> 40:13.300
IS TO DIG DOWN AND FIND
THE REAL SOURCE OF THE INJURY.

40:13.333 --> 40:17.200
