00:01.810 --> 00:03.210
What's going on
here in Rosie-land?

00:03.210 --> 00:04.150
I'm working.

00:04.150 --> 00:06.620
Rosie! Rosie!
Rosie!

00:06.620 --> 00:09.750
So, we are gonna beta test
this puppy all night.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.820
<i>She's really neat, Nana.</i>

00:12.820 --> 00:15.160
<i>And I'm taking her
on, like, a real date.</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:17.430
<i>I'm so excited, Sammy!</i>

00:17.430 --> 00:18.830
Did you hear that?
"Real date."

00:18.830 --> 00:20.760
We might actually pull this off.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.900
I mean, barring
any unforeseen calamities.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.500
Wait, what's
that scary red number mean?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.700
Uh-oh.
Oh, no.

00:33.510 --> 00:34.640
<i>Ground floor.</i>

00:34.650 --> 00:36.240
Hello!
Welcome to Heaven.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.250
Right this way for orientation.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.650
Welcome to Heaven.

00:39.650 --> 00:41.180
Welcome to Heaven.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.720
Hi. I'm Peg.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.390
Congratulations on
your completely random entry

00:50.390 --> 00:51.390

00:54.260 --> 00:55.800
As employees of Heaven Inc.,

00:55.800 --> 00:59.200
it is our responsibility
to keep Earth running smoothly.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.010
We're talking tide control.
Gravity enforcement. Teeth.

01:03.010 --> 01:05.740
Your initial department
assignments will be random,

01:05.740 --> 01:09.610

one incredibly vital position...

01:09.610 --> 01:11.480
Executive assistant to God.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.250

02:00.260 --> 02:02.930
If I may ask, why was
that test so complex?

02:02.930 --> 02:06.400
We needed to find someone
who could handle... a lot.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.139
Well, I'm so honored
that you think I'm qualified.

02:09.139 --> 02:10.340
Mm-hmm.

02:10.340 --> 02:11.470
I always wanted to have a job

02:11.480 --> 02:13.140
where I could make
a positive impact

02:13.140 --> 02:14.280

Hey-o!
New assistant alert.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.420
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!

02:29.430 --> 02:30.960
That was the alert.

Hi. I'm God.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.700

02:35.700 --> 02:37.970
All right, follow me.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.700
I hope you're ready
to hit the ground running,

02:39.700 --> 02:44.240
because we've got a real
challenge ahead of us.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.970
I was able to crack the box,

02:45.980 --> 02:50.510
but, uh, this bag ain't
going down without a fight.

02:50.510 --> 02:51.850
Can you, uh...

02:56.520 --> 02:58.790
Whoa! Muscle fingers.

02:58.790 --> 03:01.120
Oh, yeah.

03:04.330 --> 03:07.930
I guess that's everything.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.530
Oh! Look.

03:09.530 --> 03:13.270
I got a prize.

Vroom! Vroom!
Vroom!

03:15.410 --> 03:16.870
Oh, I'm keeping you.

03:16.870 --> 03:21.080
Um, put this
on the shelf for me.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.440
Thank you.

03:24.420 --> 03:25.950
Yeah.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.800
I don't get it.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.000
Sam's grandma
looks healthy to me.

04:22.010 --> 04:23.540
Yeah, well,
she's about to drop dead.

04:23.540 --> 04:25.670
When she dies,
he's gonna freak out,

04:25.680 --> 04:27.880
cancel the date, and fly home.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.680
Are we sure he's gonna fly home?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.810
Maybe they're not that close.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.820
They're pretty close.

04:59.310 --> 05:02.240
Then we'll have to go down
to the basement.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.110
What's in the basement?

05:04.110 --> 05:05.650
Death.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.060
Heaven Inc. God's Office.
Rosie. What's up?

05:17.060 --> 05:18.790
Rosie, hi.
My name is Mike.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.330
I'm the Senior Vice President
over at the Zebulon Galaxy,

05:22.330 --> 05:25.000
recently voted the top galaxy
in the omniverse.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.070
I'm not sure that my boss
is around at the moment.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.740
Actually, Rosie,
we're calling for you. Me?

05:30.740 --> 05:32.610
Word got out
the Earth is going under,

05:32.610 --> 05:34.880
and we're always on
the lookout for top talent.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.280
I'd love to buy you
a cup of coffee

05:36.280 --> 05:38.080
and tell you what we're all
about here at Zebulon.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.880
Only if you have time,
of course.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.290
Rosie! Lazy Susan's
now has a signature cocktail.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.290
And it's thick.

05:45.290 --> 05:46.890
I have time.

05:49.230 --> 05:52.230
How much bog could a bog frog
hog if bog frog could hog bog?

05:52.230 --> 05:53.960
What are you doing?
Sorry. It's...

05:53.960 --> 05:55.700
I can't control it.
It's a habit.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.900
It's something I do
when I get very nervous.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.300
What's there
to be nervous about?

05:59.300 --> 06:00.740
Hello.
Aah!

06:02.170 --> 06:03.640
Hello.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.910
Are you Death?

06:04.910 --> 06:06.910
No.<i>That's</i> Death.

06:11.050 --> 06:14.450
Cool.
Uh, we were wondering...

06:14.450 --> 06:16.990
Is there any way we could
maybe keep this lady alive?

06:16.990 --> 06:18.120
<i>How are you today?</i>

06:18.120 --> 06:19.920
That's going to be difficult.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.320
At birth, every human

06:21.330 --> 06:24.190
is randomly assigned
an expiration date.

06:24.190 --> 06:28.200
You can die before your time,
but not after.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.470
There's gotta be
something we can do.

06:30.470 --> 06:34.940
I suppose
you could file a death waiver.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.810
That'll postpone her death
for 100 days.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.070
Okay, great.
That... That...

06:39.080 --> 06:40.210
That's a real relief.
Thank you.

06:40.210 --> 06:43.480
First, you have
to get it signed by God.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.550
Good luck.

06:53.890 --> 06:56.760
What if we just asked him
nicely, obviously?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.090
Craig, there's no way
he's signing this.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.900
I bet Rosie can get him
to do it.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.500
She has him sign stuff
all the time.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.900
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie,
my favorite co-worker.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.100
Is that a new blazer?

07:09.110 --> 07:10.840
- Not now.
- Rosie, please.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.170
We need your help.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.840
If God doesn't sign this,
the Earth will explode.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.580
Maybe it should.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.780
If you want my advice,
jump ship.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.320
Find somewhere else to work.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.920
Somewhere that isn't run
by an illiterate madman.

07:26.590 --> 07:29.190
Did she just say "illiterate"?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.030
Rosie was joking, though, right?

07:36.030 --> 07:38.100
I mean,
God must be able to read.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.900
And yet, if he can't,
it would explain a lot.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.370
For example, every time
I've seen him "reading,"

07:44.370 --> 07:47.580
it looked like
his eyes weren't moving.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.110
Maybe he's just a slow reader.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.850
Maybe, but... but... but...

07:50.850 --> 07:53.320
But looking back,
there was another thing.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.120
Are you sure
you want to do that?

07:55.120 --> 07:58.650
Do what exactly?
Brush my teeth?

07:58.660 --> 07:59.990
Yeah, but with foot cream?

08:03.530 --> 08:04.790
Yes.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.930
This is what I want.

08:10.930 --> 08:15.600
It would make me really sad
if God couldn't read.

08:15.610 --> 08:19.680
But if it's true, we can
trick him into signing this.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.540
What? Mm...
It's our only chance.

08:21.550 --> 08:24.010
We're running out of time.

08:24.010 --> 08:26.280
I say we gotta risk it.
No, wait.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.080
Howdy, boozehounds.

08:29.090 --> 08:31.150
Just in time for Happy Hour.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.360
All right, now,
every bar has cocktails.

08:34.360 --> 08:38.690
But only Lazy Susan's
has Shocktails!

08:38.700 --> 08:40.030
Oh.

08:40.030 --> 08:41.100
Drink up!

08:42.299 --> 08:43.770
Mm...

08:43.770 --> 08:46.630
Yeah, the first shock
is how much liquor is in them.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.240
Yeah. Wow.
The second shock is,

08:48.240 --> 08:49.720
there are little prizes
in the bottom.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.180
Ah.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.380
Looks like this lucky bastard
found the dice.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.310
Hey, God,

08:56.310 --> 08:58.180
uh, could you sign
something for us?

08:58.180 --> 09:00.320
What is it?
Well, word got out

09:00.320 --> 09:03.850
that you were working on cool
new drinks for Lazy Susan's,

09:03.850 --> 09:07.660
and we figured you might
need a [Clicks tongue]

09:07.660 --> 09:09.790
liquor license.
Yeah.

09:09.790 --> 09:13.930
Oh, wow, Sanjay. Keepin' me
two steps ahead of Johnny Law.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.000
I'll be right back.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.270
Okay.
Nice.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.200
Guys, I'm beginning to
second-guess this plan.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.400
I mean, what if he finds out?
He's gonna be furious.

09:21.410 --> 09:23.140
Don't worry, okay?
Deep down, God's a softie.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.010
I've never seen him get mad.

09:25.010 --> 09:26.470
What in the [bleep] is this?!

09:26.480 --> 09:29.280
I ordered a burger
and <i>curly</i> fries.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.010
What... Um,
I'm pretty sure it was regular fries.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.820
Regular fries?!

09:33.820 --> 09:35.950
If there's one thing
that makes me angry,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.750
it's when someone tries
to trick me.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.150
Tries to play me for a fool.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.820
I-I'm sorry.
It's too late!

09:41.830 --> 09:43.630
The trick's already been played.

09:43.630 --> 09:45.330
You [bleep] up, hombre.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.310
Give him the punishment.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.940
What the hell?

10:04.180 --> 10:06.510
Ohh! Ohh!

10:20.200 --> 10:21.530
Don't go anywhere.

10:21.530 --> 10:25.070
Did he just turn that guy
into a jelly bean?!

10:25.070 --> 10:26.200
I don't know.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.470
Here's some information
about Zebulon.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.680
Oh, my gosh.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.810
Rosie, I'm gonna cut
straight to the chase.

10:35.810 --> 10:37.750
We think
you're more than qualified

10:37.750 --> 10:41.420
to be Zebulon's
next executive project manager.

10:41.420 --> 10:42.750
Wow.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.620
We're prepared to offer
a highly competitive salary,

10:45.620 --> 10:47.290
as well as a suite of perks,

10:47.290 --> 10:51.560
including a personal chef,
on-call masseuse,

10:51.560 --> 10:55.500
private golf course,
a company car, a bag of jewels.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.370
But most importantly,
you'll finally have a chance

10:57.370 --> 11:01.100
to make a positive impact
and do something meaningful.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.500
Let's be real, Rosie.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.370
You deserve better than Heaven.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.440
I'm in.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.640
Great.

11:07.650 --> 11:08.780
Can we go now?

11:08.780 --> 11:11.110
Can we go right now?
Let's go.

11:11.110 --> 11:12.980
Unfortunately,
we can't poach you.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.920
So you will have to wait here
until the Earth explodes.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.120
- It won't be long.
- Cheers.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.590
Bog frog hog
if a bog frog could hog bog?

11:20.590 --> 11:22.660
What is happening? What is happening? Could he
hog the whole bog, would he snog another frog

11:22.660 --> 11:24.990
on a log in the fog of a bog?
Be cool. Be cool!

11:25.000 --> 11:26.930
Bog-bog frog with a billy-bog hog
that he flogs by the bog with a log.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.530
Pull it together! Through the fog
and the smog, Mr. Frog was agog...

11:28.530 --> 11:30.130
Stop saying those words!
I need you to stay with me!

11:30.130 --> 11:33.000
We're gonna be fine.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.740
Okay. Trust me.
He can't read, okay?

11:36.740 --> 11:37.870
He can't read.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.340
Hey.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.550
Want to know a little secret?

11:44.550 --> 11:45.810
I can't read.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.680
Ah.

11:47.690 --> 11:48.820
Without my glasses.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.960
I've just been
revisiting "Oliver Twist."

11:58.960 --> 12:01.560
I know. Dickens
is a little pedestrian,

12:01.570 --> 12:02.960
but, uh, what can I say?

12:02.970 --> 12:04.230
I'm a populist.

12:07.570 --> 12:12.210
So, let's see
that liquor license.

12:17.310 --> 12:18.850
Interesting.

12:24.050 --> 12:28.520
Very, very interesting.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.860
Yeah.
Looks good to me.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.600
Wait.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.200
Before you sign,
maybe I should have a look

12:41.210 --> 12:43.340
at the fine print.
Just to be safe.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.480
Oh, well, that's
good thinking, Rosa-reen-o.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.320
Nice try.

12:58.550 --> 13:00.790
I told you guys
to let this whole thing go.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.320
Just get out of here before
he turns you into beans.

13:02.330 --> 13:03.390
Wait.
So, is that confirmed?

13:03.390 --> 13:04.860
That is actually what happened?

13:04.860 --> 13:06.800
W-Why won't anybody answer me?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.530
No one is even looking at me.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.400
Look at me!

13:09.400 --> 13:12.330
Rosie, if you don't care
about Earth,

13:12.340 --> 13:14.000
don't you at least care
about keeping your job?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.270
I found a better one.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.670
Executive Project Manager
at Zebulon.

13:17.670 --> 13:19.140
Respect.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.280
Let's get out of here.
Wait.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.220
Why do you want
to work for this place?

13:27.220 --> 13:29.820
Because they're the best.
Exactly.

13:29.820 --> 13:32.620
They're the best.
They don't need any help.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.690
Meanwhile, this place
is such a crazy mess,

13:34.690 --> 13:36.690
it's about to go under,
and the only ones

13:36.690 --> 13:38.230
trying to fix things
are the three of us,

13:38.230 --> 13:39.560
and we have no idea
what we're doing.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.900
None.
Hm.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.360
I am objectively bad
at my job...

13:43.370 --> 13:45.230
I have accidentally killed
a ton of people...

13:45.240 --> 13:48.100
And
I'm the leader of this group.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.500
It's true.
She leads us.

13:49.510 --> 13:54.310
Look. We are about
to get turned into beans.

13:54.310 --> 13:56.710
We are desperate
for someone like you.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.910
You can go to Zebulon,

13:57.920 --> 14:02.320
but if you do that,
your talents will be wasted.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.450
'Cause those people
don't need you.

14:05.460 --> 14:09.790
We do.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.070
All right.
Now that you've tried the small,

14:16.070 --> 14:18.400
you got to try the medium.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.470
How's that fine print looking,
Rosie?

14:22.740 --> 14:26.080
It looks like
a standard liquor license.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.680
Yes! She saved us!
No, I gave it away!

14:28.680 --> 14:31.010
He knows!

14:31.010 --> 14:32.410
Craig...

14:32.420 --> 14:36.350
Rosie, would you mind
reading the document out loud?

14:46.560 --> 14:53.030
"This contract for the sale
of alcoholic beverages

14:53.040 --> 14:56.110
is between
Lazy Susan's Enterprises

14:56.110 --> 14:58.240
and the Transdimensional
Law Enforcement Bureau.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.570
Upon signing,

14:59.580 --> 15:04.250
the sale of spirits,
such as Shocktails,

15:04.250 --> 15:05.850
will be legally permitted."

15:05.850 --> 15:08.180
Would you like to write in
any amendments?

15:08.190 --> 15:09.450
Nah.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.720
Sounds good to me.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.660
Oh.
We gotta go.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.000
Oh.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.130
Uh...
Thank you.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.130
You haven't tried the...
What? Oh.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.670
All right.

15:28.610 --> 15:31.670
<i>Life extension granted.</i>

15:31.680 --> 15:34.340
<i>100 days.</i>

15:34.350 --> 15:36.810
Congratulations.
Yes!

15:41.280 --> 15:42.750
This one?

15:42.750 --> 15:44.090
Or this one?

15:44.090 --> 15:46.290
<i>You can wear one
on the first date</i>

15:46.290 --> 15:48.020
<i>and one on the second.</i>

15:48.030 --> 15:49.630
<i>Nana.</i>

15:50.960 --> 15:52.290
To Nana.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.160
No. To Rosie.

15:55.170 --> 15:57.500
Congrats.
Zebulon is lucky to have you.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.840
They don't have me
until the Earth explodes.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.100
And maybe it won't.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.110
Mm.

16:14.250 --> 16:18.720
All right. Well, this calls
for an extra-special toast.

16:18.720 --> 16:23.930
I pilfered this from upstairs.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.330
Wow, Craig.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.860
Pretty bold.
Yeah. I was very drunk.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.870
I still am.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.130
Cheers.
Oh.

16:31.130 --> 16:33.800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.070
So, we should get back to work.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.210
- Yeah.
- What?

16:36.210 --> 16:37.670
Oh, okay.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.750
Uh, Hello?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.420
Hello?

16:51.420 --> 16:53.090
Good evening, Craig.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.620
Um... you...

16:55.630 --> 16:58.960
You wanted to see me, sir?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.830
I couldn't help but notice
that some

17:00.830 --> 17:04.170
of my signature Shocktail
umbrellas have gone missing.

17:04.170 --> 17:07.569
Have they? Oh, no.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.369
I don't think they blew away.

17:10.369 --> 17:13.310
Do <i>you</i> think
they blew away, Craig?

17:13.310 --> 17:15.380
I'm so sorry.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.849
I only took a few umbrellas.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.780
I-I really like umbrellas.

17:19.780 --> 17:23.520
We all like umbrellas.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.660
They turn every drink
into a party.

17:26.660 --> 17:30.120
See?

17:30.130 --> 17:31.990
Aren't we having fun now?

17:33.660 --> 17:35.860
You stabbed me in the back.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.930
It's time for the punishment.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.070
Oh... no.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.410
Oh, how much bog
could a bog frog hog

17:49.410 --> 17:51.680
if a bog frog could hog bog?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.950
Shh.

17:53.950 --> 17:56.620
It's over.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.890
It's done.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.900
Okay, so, check it out...

18:07.900 --> 18:11.370
I love root-beer-flavored
jelly beans,

18:11.370 --> 18:13.240
but they only put one
in each jar.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.100
And the lids
are screwed on tight.

18:16.110 --> 18:19.170
So the punishment is,
you open that jar,

18:19.180 --> 18:23.450
find me a root beer,
and then fork over that bean.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.810
Go ahead.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.090
Here you go.

18:41.470 --> 18:44.200
Punishment served.
Oh.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.930
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you back there.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.200
No, it's okay.
I-I understand.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.210
You... You were trying
to teach me a lesson,

18:50.210 --> 18:52.940
and I have
definitely learned it.

18:52.940 --> 18:55.940
I'm very sorry
and also very relieved

18:55.950 --> 18:59.210
that this is
the... whole punishment?

18:59.220 --> 19:00.880
Yep. This is it.

19:00.890 --> 19:01.890
This is it.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.090
This is it.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.490
The <i>first</i> time.
