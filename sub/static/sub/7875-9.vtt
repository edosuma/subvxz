00:33.590 --> 00:37.010
God, what was I thinking?
I don't wanna be an organ donor.

00:37.177 --> 00:40.805
People out there
just rooting for me to die.

00:41.722 --> 00:43.766
Steve, it's a beautiful afternoon.

00:43.933 --> 00:46.102
Shouldn't you be outside
with your friends...

00:46.268 --> 00:50.689
...turning my tool shed
into Mordor or Endor...

00:50.856 --> 00:52.482
...or something heartbreaking?

00:52.649 --> 00:54.442
I've given up that dorky pastime...

00:54.608 --> 00:56.652
...and decided to follow
my true passion:

00:56.819 --> 00:58.112
Backup dancing.

00:58.279 --> 01:01.073
Look. I'm good, but I don't pull focus.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.408
Work it, Dad. You're the star.

01:03.575 --> 01:06.119
Thrust it. Thrust it. Thrust it.

01:06.286 --> 01:08.288
Then hide the reveal.

01:08.454 --> 01:11.999
We really should have spaced out
your vaccinations.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.752
What the...?

01:20.339 --> 01:24.051
- My study.
- And my Turkish bath. Have a fig.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.678
You are so dead.

01:29.514 --> 01:31.308
Hold on.

01:40.232 --> 01:43.402
- You destroyed my study.
- You barged into my sauna.

01:43.569 --> 01:47.405
You know how stressful that is?
I had just unclenched my anus.

01:47.572 --> 01:49.407
My sanctuary is ruined.

01:49.574 --> 01:51.784
You are the most selfish thing
I've ever met.

01:51.951 --> 01:54.244
What are you talking about?
I offered you a fig.

01:54.411 --> 01:55.871
I offered him a fig, Francine.

01:56.038 --> 01:58.457
Is that true, Stan?
Did he offer you a fig?

01:58.624 --> 02:01.001
Because that sounds like
the opposite of selfish.

02:01.168 --> 02:02.501
That sounds nutritious.

02:02.668 --> 02:05.379
- All you ever do is defend him.
- Oh, I do not.

02:05.546 --> 02:07.298
Please, you're always doing it.

02:08.591 --> 02:12.302
- Roger painted me in my sleep.
- My canvas is life. I'm an artist.

02:12.469 --> 02:15.055
Leave him alone, honey.
He's an artist.

02:16.264 --> 02:19.558
<i>- Roger stuck a syringe in my chest.
- I was playing Pulp Fiction.</i>

02:19.725 --> 02:22.603
The bitch was OD'ing on me,
I gave her a shot in the heart.

02:22.770 --> 02:25.856
Leave him alone, Stan.
He thought you were an OD'ing bitch.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.233
- He took my hair.
- He took my land.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.153
Leave him alone, honey.
You took his land.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.280
You have to stop making excuses
for him. You're an enabler.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.407
I am not. He's an alien.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.743
He doesn't understand
how things work here.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.162
He's been on this planet
for 60 years.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.039
He knew Stockard Channing
when she was in her late 40s.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.584
No, I knew Stockard Channing
in the late '40s. She was 50.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.169
God, I'm sick of you.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.838
Francine, if you wanna deal with Roger,
be my guest, but I am through.

02:54.005 --> 02:57.258
- You're dead to me.
- Well, you're dead to me too.

02:57.425 --> 03:00.011
You hear me?
I don't care what you think.

03:00.178 --> 03:02.805
He hates me.

03:02.971 --> 03:05.933
Oh, Roger. No, he doesn't.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.060
Please don't cry.

03:12.271 --> 03:14.273
He doesn't care...

03:14.440 --> 03:18.902
...if I live or die.

03:19.694 --> 03:21.279
I'm gonna kill myself.

03:21.446 --> 03:25.075
I'm gonna go to Europe
and throw myself in the Baltic Sea.

03:25.242 --> 03:29.328
Roger, please, don't talk like that.
Of course Stan cares.

03:29.495 --> 03:32.289
- I'll prove it to you.
- Really? How?

03:32.456 --> 03:34.582
Don't worry. I'll come up with a plan.

03:34.749 --> 03:36.000
Yes, a plan.

03:36.167 --> 03:38.503
I was gonna say,
"Let's just let stuff happen"...

03:38.670 --> 03:40.004
...but, yes, a plan.

03:40.171 --> 03:42.631
- Where are you going?
- I have to fold laundry.

03:42.798 --> 03:44.383
- Can I come with?
- Sure.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.219
- Will you carry me?
- Aren't you a little big for...?

03:47.386 --> 03:51.264
- I'm sad.
- Okay. Okay.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.934
You're a big boy.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.110
I like being carried.

04:06.570 --> 04:10.447
Hey, Klaus, check it out.
My dad is gonna hit the roof.

04:10.614 --> 04:13.325
Oh, a temporary henna tattoo.
How daring.

04:13.492 --> 04:17.286
What's next?
You gonna bake cookies at 351 degrees?

04:17.452 --> 04:21.249
Like you're so daring. You won't even go
into the deep end of your own bowl.

04:21.416 --> 04:25.544
Oh, really? Maybe we should settle this
with a game of Truth or Dare.

04:25.711 --> 04:27.421
How about Dare or Dare?

04:27.588 --> 04:29.631
How about I punch you
in the bleeping face?

04:29.798 --> 04:33.593
See what I did? I bleeped myself.
I took the joy away from the censors.

04:33.759 --> 04:36.596
Yeah, I'll play your game of dares,
little girl.

04:36.762 --> 04:39.181
I'm a bleeping force
to be reckoned with.

04:39.348 --> 04:42.851
Okay, I'll go first.
I dare you to kiss me.

04:43.018 --> 04:45.270
<i>All my Nancy Drews, ruined.</i>

04:45.437 --> 04:49.065
Now I'll never know
how that ghost left footprints.

04:50.107 --> 04:51.775
<i>- Hello.
- We have Roger.</i>

04:51.942 --> 04:54.278
<i>- What? Who is this?
- The kidnappers.</i>

04:54.445 --> 04:57.406
Right. If you have Roger,
then where did you snatch him from?

04:57.573 --> 05:00.366
<i>- Cinnabon.
- You savages.</i>

05:00.533 --> 05:02.452
If you wanna see Roger again...

05:02.619 --> 05:08.290
...bring $ 1000 to the abandoned
ice factory in Lanceton by 6 p. M...

05:08.457 --> 05:10.459
<i>... or we cut him in half.</i>

05:17.423 --> 05:21.010
- Well, what did he say? Is he worried?
- He's very worried.

05:21.177 --> 05:25.013
This is great.
And what a location for a kidnapping.

05:25.180 --> 05:29.684
If I were writing a play, which I am,
but not about kidnapping, I'd set it here.

05:29.851 --> 05:34.897
"Interior. Lanceton Ice Factory.
Magic hour."

05:35.064 --> 05:39.817
And maybe the call of a lone crow
can echo in the distance.

05:39.984 --> 05:42.487
Maybe.
Maybe that could be in your play.

05:42.654 --> 05:44.947
Hurry and tie me up.
He'll be here any minute.

05:52.079 --> 05:54.623
<i>I hope I'm not too late.
Please Don 't Hurt Him!</i>

05:54.790 --> 05:56.374
<i>One for Please Don 't Hurt Him!</i>

05:57.500 --> 06:01.420
- That'll be 8.50.
- 8.50? In the newspaper it says 5.50.

06:01.587 --> 06:06.549
That's when the movie starts, sir.
That's why you showed up at 5:50.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.011
Feel good? Feel like a big man?

06:18.268 --> 06:21.938
Where is he? Stan should have been here
with the ransom hours ago.

06:22.105 --> 06:25.149
- I knew he didn't care about me.
- Maybe he's lost.

06:25.316 --> 06:29.153
Of course he's lost. Lanceton?
This place is barely on the map.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.114
Lanceton makes Idledale
look like West Hemmitberg.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.660
Look, just calm down. I'll go home
and try to find out what happened.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.869
- Hungry.
- Okay.

06:39.036 --> 06:42.415
Well, I have a Baggie of grapes
in my purse.

06:43.874 --> 06:46.876
Were you ever gonna tell me
about the grapes?

06:48.962 --> 06:52.924
You see why this isn't working, right?
Feed them to me.

06:55.926 --> 06:57.553
I don't like grapes.

06:57.719 --> 07:01.056
Come on, I dare you.
You have been dared.

07:03.474 --> 07:05.309
My God, I can't believe you did that.

07:05.476 --> 07:08.938
Now you must rely solely on your eyelash
for protection from debris.

07:09.438 --> 07:11.440
Stan, what are you doing here?

07:11.607 --> 07:12.941
Just watching commercials...

07:13.108 --> 07:16.653
...trying to figure out
which truck is the most rugged.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.698
Hey, I haven't seen Roger all day.
Have you?

07:19.865 --> 07:23.659
Oh, you just missed him. He said
he's going to a bachelor party in Napa.

07:23.826 --> 07:25.619
- In Napa?
- Yeah.

07:25.786 --> 07:30.290
- Roger's at a bachelor party in Napa?
- Yes.

07:30.456 --> 07:32.750
Who's getting married?

07:32.917 --> 07:34.836
Ken.

07:35.003 --> 07:37.754
<i>I know he's lying,
but I can 't call him on it.</i>

07:37.921 --> 07:41.508
<i>Because if I say, "He's not in Napa,
he's at the ice factory"...</i>

07:41.675 --> 07:43.343
<i>... he'll say, "How do you know?"</i>

07:43.510 --> 07:46.220
<i>And I'll be like:</i>

07:47.263 --> 07:51.267
<i>Oh, God, he's looking at me.
Say something.</i>

07:51.434 --> 07:54.436
<i>That wasn 't saying something,
that was doing something.</i>

07:54.603 --> 07:55.937
Clapping.

07:56.104 --> 07:57.272
<i>Attagirl.</i>

08:00.358 --> 08:02.359
<i>- Hello.
- Why didn 't you show up?</i>

08:02.526 --> 08:06.030
- Amanda?
- Amanda? No, this is the kidnappers.

08:06.196 --> 08:08.407
<i>- Oh, hey, how are you?
- Who 's Amanda?</i>

08:08.574 --> 08:10.326
<i>- Just a friend.
- A work friend?</i>

08:10.491 --> 08:14.203
I'm sorry you had to kill Roger, but
a thousand bucks, that's a little steep.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.789
No, we didn't kill him. Yet.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.416
But we hear what you're saying.
Times are tough.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.337
So let's say... What, $ 100?

08:23.503 --> 08:26.423
- Forty dollars?
- I don't know.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.842
<i>Look, just bring us whatever you have
in your change jar.</i>

08:30.009 --> 08:32.886
- Okay, I guess.
- That's right, you guess.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.890
<i>Get here by midnight
or we cut off his head.</i>

08:38.099 --> 08:42.187
- Francine, where's our change jar?
- Oh, Stan, I'm so proud of you.

08:42.354 --> 08:46.815
- For what?
- You called it "our change jar."

08:46.982 --> 08:50.486
I guess we're really in this
for the long haul.

08:53.071 --> 08:55.865
He couldn't get the money together
so I lowered the price.

08:56.032 --> 08:58.201
That makes sense.
You set the price too high.

08:58.368 --> 09:01.828
Of course it's hard for him
with you not working, not contributing.

09:02.579 --> 09:04.414
Okay.

09:04.581 --> 09:07.834
I can't wait for Stan to ride in here
like a white knight...

09:08.001 --> 09:10.211
...and hug me and give me hugs.

09:10.378 --> 09:13.589
Well, in the meantime,
I brought you your tacos.

09:13.756 --> 09:17.218
Thank God. I am starving.

09:17.385 --> 09:20.428
This is Taco Barn. I said Taco King.

09:20.595 --> 09:23.264
Aren't they the same thing?
Anyway, Stan's coming, so...

09:23.431 --> 09:26.809
I'm sorry, I just have to ask:
Have I committed some crime?

09:26.975 --> 09:30.938
Did I clean my toilet with a washcloth,
then jam it into your mother's mouth?

09:31.105 --> 09:35.191
- What?
- Because that's what you're doing to me.

09:35.650 --> 09:38.778
Okay. That was just an accident.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.323
No, it wasn't. How did I end up here?

09:42.490 --> 09:45.992
Stuck in an old ice factory
in my least favorite wig...

09:46.159 --> 09:50.038
...all part
of some dizzy blond's joyride.

09:50.664 --> 09:52.498
Don't cry, Roger.

09:55.751 --> 09:59.963
No. I hate it here. It's drafty.

10:07.637 --> 10:12.891
Roger, please calm down.
Look, what if I take you to a motel?

10:13.058 --> 10:17.562
A motel?
You think I'm a prostitute, but I'm not.

10:17.728 --> 10:20.523
Okay, okay.
How about the Four Seasons?

10:20.690 --> 10:23.151
Carry me there.

10:23.317 --> 10:26.570
I'm gonna hold on to your hair
for safety.

10:29.114 --> 10:32.659
Stan, how come you asked
where the change jar was last night?

10:32.826 --> 10:34.618
I knew I was gonna be barbecuing...

10:34.785 --> 10:38.038
...and I didn't want the napkins
flying all over the yard.

10:39.498 --> 10:42.542
- I miss Roger. Don't you miss Roger?
- Nope.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.461
Well, maybe
you don't miss him now...

10:45.628 --> 10:49.507
...but sometimes the things
we take for granted disappear...

10:49.674 --> 10:53.719
...and we can never get them back.

10:54.636 --> 10:56.388
Got it, Hayley. I did it.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.974
I guess what I'm saying is,
you're gonna miss him.

11:00.141 --> 11:01.434
- Who?
- Roger.

11:01.601 --> 11:05.855
Oh, I forgot to tell you. Roger called
and said his people came back for him.

11:06.022 --> 11:09.316
Roger called and said
his people came back for him?

11:09.482 --> 11:12.402
- Yes.
- Roger's going back to his planet?

11:12.569 --> 11:14.738
Yes, but he said
if we went up on the roof...

11:14.904 --> 11:17.406
...he'd fly over
and send us a goodbye message.

11:17.573 --> 11:20.075
Of course, you'll have to wear this.

11:22.745 --> 11:25.496
- Where's your pot?
- I have these tongs.

11:25.663 --> 11:29.667
I'm getting a message.
Quick, wave. He wants us to wave.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.710
What's he saying to you?

11:31.877 --> 11:34.504
I guess pretty much the same thing
he's saying to you.

11:34.671 --> 11:37.299
He said everyone would get
their own personal message.

11:37.466 --> 11:40.384
Adjust your pot.
Come on, what's he saying?

11:42.470 --> 11:45.973
- I think...
- Is he saying, "We have caller ID"?

11:46.140 --> 11:50.101
Is he saying, " Next time you kidnap
Roger, don't use your cell phone"?

11:50.268 --> 11:51.353
Is that his message?

11:53.021 --> 11:56.691
- You knew the whole time?
- Of course.

11:56.857 --> 11:58.942
Oh, Stan, it's been awful.

11:59.109 --> 12:03.447
I just wanted to show him you cared,
but it turned into a nightmare.

12:03.614 --> 12:07.909
Roger's a selfish, inconsiderate beast.

12:08.076 --> 12:12.121
Look at this. It's taco.
He did this to me.

12:12.288 --> 12:15.499
He was screaming, spitting grapes.

12:15.666 --> 12:18.210
He even made me buy him a Yorkie...

12:18.377 --> 12:22.922
...and then take it back
when it wouldn't dance for him.

12:23.089 --> 12:25.424
Because he knows
he can get away with it.

12:25.591 --> 12:29.095
You want him to stop being a brat,
stop enabling him. Get tough.

12:29.261 --> 12:31.471
You're right. You were right all along.

12:31.638 --> 12:32.722
Hey, look.

12:32.889 --> 12:36.476
I've been here background dancing
to your conversation the entire time...

12:36.643 --> 12:40.479
...and you didn't even notice.
I am awesome.

12:43.065 --> 12:47.027
- So there is no Amanda?
- There is, but she's fat.

12:52.323 --> 12:55.492
Put the bucket of clams in the corner.
I'm not ready for them yet.

12:55.659 --> 12:58.161
That smear on the sheets
is a peppermint patty.

12:58.328 --> 12:59.913
It was here when I got here.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.666
- Oh, it's you.
- Roger, Stan isn't coming.

13:02.833 --> 13:06.585
What? Oh, my God, Francine.
What did you do this time?

13:06.752 --> 13:09.505
I'm gonna throw this sea bass
on your shoes.

13:09.672 --> 13:14.092
There. Now your shoes
stink as bad as your ideas.

13:19.055 --> 13:21.640
You... You struck me with a bass.

13:21.807 --> 13:24.518
That's right.
Because you're a spoiled brat.

13:24.685 --> 13:28.147
You whine and you complain
and you walk all over me.

13:28.313 --> 13:31.858
But no more. I'm done.

13:35.653 --> 13:39.531
Go ahead, cry.
I'm not enabling you anymore.

13:47.204 --> 13:51.000
- Finished?
- I don't know. Yes.

13:51.167 --> 13:53.169
You wanna know
why Stan didn't show up?

13:53.335 --> 13:54.794
Because he doesn't like you.

13:54.961 --> 13:57.922
And you know what?
I don't like you either.

13:58.089 --> 14:00.508
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

14:00.675 --> 14:04.386
And if you wanna win back my love
and be part of this family...

14:04.553 --> 14:07.347
...you're gonna have to change.
You have to be nice.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.475
I can't be nice all the time.
It's not in my nature.

14:10.642 --> 14:14.478
Then I'm sorry, Roger,
but this is goodbye.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.736
No! Don't go!

14:22.903 --> 14:25.697
I'll do anything.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.574
Are you sure? You're really ready?

14:28.741 --> 14:32.202
Yes. Yes. I'm ready to quit drinking.

14:32.369 --> 14:35.080
- That's not what this is about.
- Thank God.

14:39.584 --> 14:42.545
Good, you're here.
There's someone I want you to meet.

14:42.712 --> 14:46.757
Say hello to a well-behaved fellow
who's very sorry.

14:46.924 --> 14:48.926
I'm very sorry.

14:49.092 --> 14:50.719
I know I've been a real pain...

14:50.886 --> 14:53.220
...but I'm gonna be super nice
from now on.

14:54.805 --> 14:56.349
Should keep it in your study.

14:56.515 --> 14:59.644
It's nice and humid in there
from all the steam. I'm very sorry.

14:59.810 --> 15:01.811
Say it. You have to say it.

15:01.978 --> 15:04.981
Help! Raccoons took my penis.

15:08.818 --> 15:13.280
- Allow me, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, Roger.

15:13.447 --> 15:18.534
Why, you have fantastic posture.
A truly presidential carriage.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.787
Beat it, kiss ass.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.455
- Stan.
- I'm sorry.

15:22.622 --> 15:26.375
It's gonna take more than a few accurate
observations about my handsomeness...

15:26.541 --> 15:28.835
...to convince me
that Roger's changed.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.431
Nailed it.

15:42.598 --> 15:46.059
Well, Roger,
tell Steve what you think.

15:47.811 --> 15:51.605
You were really good.

16:00.446 --> 16:02.990
Wow, it's so bright and cheery
in here.

16:03.157 --> 16:05.618
Thank you.

16:05.785 --> 16:07.537
They've been doing that all morning.

16:07.703 --> 16:10.330
When I get four and 20,
I'm gonna bake them into a pie.

16:10.497 --> 16:14.334
See? I told you it wouldn't kill you
to be nice.

16:59.415 --> 17:02.793
I've gotta hand it to you, Francine,
you turned Roger around.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.920
He made me laugh
for 10 minutes straight.

17:05.087 --> 17:06.755
When I'd had enough, he stopped.

17:06.921 --> 17:09.965
A little tough love
turned out to be just what he needed.

17:10.133 --> 17:13.303
- We should do something nice for him.
- Let's get him a kayak.

17:13.469 --> 17:15.387
That's a great idea. Where is Roger?

17:15.554 --> 17:18.223
Let's tell him we're thinking
about getting him a kayak.

17:18.390 --> 17:21.560
I saw him go into your study
with a sledgehammer and a watermelon.

17:21.727 --> 17:25.021
- What?
- Gotta be an explanation. Gallagher Day?

17:25.188 --> 17:28.900
Do you see a Gallagher tree, Francine?
Roger's back to his old ways.

17:29.066 --> 17:32.485
I am livid, Francine.
Now I know how bears feel.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.946
Roger, you son of a...

17:36.489 --> 17:39.951
Surprise. Your study's reborn.

17:40.118 --> 17:44.371
Oh, my God, Roger. Thank you.
This is the nicest thing you've ever done.

17:44.538 --> 17:47.666
Please note the fruit bouquet.

17:47.833 --> 17:52.337
Escape into the taste of summer.

17:57.758 --> 18:00.510
I was nice in the end.

18:00.677 --> 18:03.221
You'll remember that.

18:03.639 --> 18:05.848
Save your strength.

18:06.974 --> 18:09.226
Roger, you can't die.

18:09.393 --> 18:12.396
Roger, what happened to you?

18:12.563 --> 18:14.981
What happened to me?

18:15.148 --> 18:17.776
What happened to you?

18:17.943 --> 18:21.696
Oh, Klaus dared me to dress
like Captain Stubing for 14 months.

18:21.863 --> 18:24.365
And she dared me
to congeal myself in Jell-O.

18:26.825 --> 18:30.037
That is really stupid.

18:30.204 --> 18:34.332
Really, really stupid.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.001
Look. The flower.

18:37.168 --> 18:39.670
When Roger's a jerk,
the flower perks up.

18:39.836 --> 18:43.215
Roger, is being nice killing you?

18:43.382 --> 18:47.843
My people
need to let our bitchiness out...

18:48.010 --> 18:51.972
...otherwise it turns to bile
and poisons us.

18:52.139 --> 18:58.395
- Why didn't you say something?
- Because you all liked me this way.

18:58.561 --> 19:01.564
I was finally
making you proud, Francine.

19:01.731 --> 19:05.275
- Oh, God. Is this all my fault?
- Yes.

19:05.442 --> 19:07.403
Roger, please, be mean.

19:07.569 --> 19:10.155
If you have to be a jerk to live,
then come on.

19:10.322 --> 19:11.990
Give us all you got.

19:12.157 --> 19:14.909
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Roger, we're sure.

19:15.076 --> 19:17.078
Okay.

19:17.245 --> 19:19.247
Send me Steve.

19:20.581 --> 19:23.041
Dance for me.

19:25.043 --> 19:29.131
Okay, okay, that's enough.
I've got what I need.

19:29.297 --> 19:31.882
You are terrible.

19:32.049 --> 19:35.010
You've got no rhythm,
no coordination.

19:35.177 --> 19:40.515
I've seen two epileptics share a bowl
of noodles with more grace.

19:41.850 --> 19:44.561
If your goal was to inspire
a feeling of despair...

19:44.727 --> 19:48.230
...the likes of which hasn't been felt
since Whoopi hosted the Oscars...

19:48.397 --> 19:51.191
...then bravo.
- Okay, I think that's enough, Roger.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.235
Honey, no. It's good for both of them.

19:53.402 --> 19:56.571
I can envision millions of Americans
rising up as one...

19:56.737 --> 20:00.408
...and demanding legislation that would
require your legs to be amputated...

20:00.575 --> 20:02.535
...burned and buried next to Hitler.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.244
In short, you suck.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.413
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.625
Oh, Roger, you're back.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.878
And you're starting
to get lunch-lady arms.

20:14.044 --> 20:16.255
What an ugly thing to say.

20:16.422 --> 20:18.924
I never should have tried
to change you.

20:19.091 --> 20:22.427
And I shouldn't have tried
to change myself, either.

20:22.594 --> 20:25.346
I'm an enabler. That's just who I am.

20:25.513 --> 20:28.098
Yeah, kind of like how Stan
is a giant douche bag.

20:28.265 --> 20:31.685
- Hey, take that back.
- Don't have to. That's not who I am.

20:33.562 --> 20:36.148
Where are you going?
You said you're an enabler.

20:36.315 --> 20:37.481
Oh, I am.

20:37.648 --> 20:41.360
And I'll be your enabler as soon
as Stan finishes being who he is:

20:41.527 --> 20:44.447
The guy who beats the crap out of you
when you deserve it.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.245
Dammit, why is this door locked?
Francine?

20:53.412 --> 20:57.458
Is this for the taco on the dress?
Francine, open the door, you bitch.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.585
Hi, Stan. Thank goodness you're here.

20:59.752 --> 21:02.170
This door is stuck.
Can you get it for me?

21:02.337 --> 21:05.632
Okay, it's almost open.
Now I'll throw you.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.468
Oh, me again? Okay.

21:44.290 --> 21:46.376
