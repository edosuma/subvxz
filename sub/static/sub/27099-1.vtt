02:45.164 --> 02:45.998
Sir?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.096
I don't think
he wants to talk to you.

03:03.098 --> 03:04.556
How do you know?

03:04.558 --> 03:06.017
'Cause it's dead!

03:06.019 --> 03:06.853
Sir...

03:09.188 --> 03:10.022
Sir...

04:10.375 --> 04:11.209
Hello?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.179
Anybody there?

04:32.439 --> 04:33.605
Anybody there?

05:38.088 --> 05:41.174
Fucking cat.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.512
Fucking cat.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.735
You sure you're okay, babe?

08:11.156 --> 08:13.242
Okay, whatever you say.

08:16.036 --> 08:17.663
I think this will
be good for us.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.164
Fresh start, clean slate.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.543
Push in the right direction.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.215
Look how beautiful
it is out here.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.511
I think we should live
here when we grow old.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.390
Don't
even think about it.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.474
Nah, this is the way to live.

08:39.476 --> 08:40.600
Like free people.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.768
Free people.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.895
Yeah, free people.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.355
What the fuck are
you talking about?

08:45.357 --> 08:48.108
You know, be one with nature.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.359
Tree of life.

08:49.361 --> 08:50.777
This is where man belongs.

08:50.779 --> 08:52.070
It's not in the city

08:52.072 --> 08:54.031
with all the overpopulation
and conflicts.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.407
Look at all this space!

08:55.409 --> 08:57.410
Space is overrated.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.704
I love the sound
of trains and buses

09:00.706 --> 09:05.209
and the smell of urine
on my walk to the subway.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.712
Please take me back.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.839
- No.
- Please!

09:09.841 --> 09:11.715
Nope, mm-mm.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.550
Please!

09:12.552 --> 09:13.759
No, s...

09:13.761 --> 09:15.344
- Please.
- Ow, what the hell?

09:15.346 --> 09:16.637
Stop, stop!

09:16.639 --> 09:17.847
Stop it or I'll...

09:17.849 --> 09:18.680
You'll do what?

09:18.682 --> 09:19.515
I'll hit you back.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.017
Okay.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.477
Do you feel big now? Do
you feel like a real man?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.480
Why do you have to
be such an asshole?

09:26.857 --> 09:27.691
Because.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.876
Uh, where'd I put the...

10:29.379 --> 10:30.212
There we go.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.842
You want anything?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.846
Yeah, my life back.

10:39.139 --> 10:39.972
Really?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.772
Hey guys.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.519
There's strange people here.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.528
Oh, here we go.

12:23.283 --> 12:24.119
Mmm.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.417
What?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.960
Why are you
drinking and driving?

12:34.962 --> 12:36.423
Rose, give me a break.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.475
Stop the car.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.227
Fine.

12:53.313 --> 12:54.149
Get out.

12:58.028 --> 12:58.861
Now.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.587
Get in the car, Harry.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.388
Let's go, Harry.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.475
I'm coming.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.947
- Any day now.
- Shut up!

14:39.796 --> 14:40.879
Are we lost?

14:41.965 --> 14:42.798
Of course not.

14:44.759 --> 14:45.677
So where are we?

14:46.885 --> 14:49.012
Uh, in the woods.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.762
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.975
I can see that.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.977
But really, where?

14:55.979 --> 14:58.478
Uh, we are almost
to the cabin.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.022
No but, like,
show me on the map.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.440
Hey, would you chill out?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.691
I got this.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.943
Clearly
you've got this,

15:03.945 --> 15:05.152
'cause look where
we are right now.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.781
Would you stop
being a bitch, please?

15:09.116 --> 15:09.950
Okay.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.206
Why don't you guys
just sell the place?

15:18.208 --> 15:21.335
It is a family place
with sentimental value.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.338
So please...

15:25.258 --> 15:28.008
I swear if it's a dump,
I'm gonna leave you.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.386
It's not a dump!

15:32.264 --> 15:33.138
I can't stand this place.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.308
What can't you stand?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.767
I dunno, the fact
that we just spent

15:36.769 --> 15:38.895
five miserable hours
together in the car.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.649
- Rose, Rose.
- What?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.403
Please give me a break.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.240
All right, let's go.

15:54.162 --> 15:54.995
Come on.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.302
Do you think someone lives here?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.512
I dunno.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.850
I don't remember
this house at all.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.145
- Oh my God.
- Ooh.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.940
That's creepy.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.567
And you're sure
this is the right place?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.944
Yeah, yeah, come here.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.406
That's the cabin right
there, across the lake.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.038
Okay, someone's
gotta live here.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.497
I hope so, I gotta
go to the bathroom.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.500
- Just go over there!
- No, it's number two.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.378
Can I help you guys?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.172
We're actually
just looking for...

17:30.174 --> 17:32.049
Looking for...

17:32.051 --> 17:34.384
We're looking for a boat to
cross the lake to the cabin.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.678
Our cabin's on the other side.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.890
Yeah, right.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.852
Right, um...

17:47.733 --> 17:50.234
Uh, you wouldn't happen to
have a bathroom, would you?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.986
I really have to go.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.911
Sorry man, it's broken.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.662
Okay, um...

18:02.664 --> 18:04.248
Do you mind if we
park our car here?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.417
This is private
property, so no.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.669
I don't mean to intrude...

18:07.671 --> 18:08.920
But you are.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.796
Okay, we just
want to cross the lake

18:09.798 --> 18:11.588
to get to the cabin.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.424
That's it.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.593
Yeah.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.472
Okay, come here.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.475
Do you see the cabin on
the other side of the lake?

18:22.477 --> 18:24.267
That is my parent's cabin.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.769
So?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.939
So, when we were
kids, we would take that boat

18:27.941 --> 18:29.524
and we would cross the lake.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.067
We were just hoping we
could still do that.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.780
Yeah, sure.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.701
But you cannot park
the car over there.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.287
- Okay, we'll move it.
- Yeah.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.245
Oh, come on.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.999
Okay.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.723
All right, have a good one.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.933
Psst!

19:46.935 --> 19:48.353
Meow!

19:48.355 --> 19:49.189
Woof!

19:51.357 --> 19:53.274
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

19:53.276 --> 19:56.361
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

19:56.363 --> 19:58.071

20:10.835 --> 20:12.794

20:12.796 --> 20:13.630
For once.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.630
Okay.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.218
God.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.894
There's no reception!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.396
Hey.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.898
Take it easy for once.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.232
Relax.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.151
- Really?
- Yeah!

20:37.987 --> 20:39.487
This is just stressful

20:39.489 --> 20:41.698
that I only have you
to communicate with.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.865
Like, if I fall and
break a leg or something,

20:43.867 --> 20:45.159
and you need to dial 911 or...

20:45.161 --> 20:47.077
I just sent you
a text in the car.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.414
It's probably temporary.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.668
Fucking shit!

20:54.586 --> 20:55.545
Dammit.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.880
This is your fucking fault!

20:57.882 --> 20:59.426
I didn't even want to come here!

21:01.510 --> 21:03.928
Hey, hey, calm down.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.724
It's just a phone, 'kay?

23:32.202 --> 23:34.411
I cannot believe this shit.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.122
It's not even a real toilet!

23:36.124 --> 23:38.125
- This is a real toilet.
- Fuck you.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.546
I fucking hate you, Harry.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.799
Should've listened to my
mother, she hated you.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.009
Oh, did she?

23:49.011 --> 23:51.094
Yeah, she was actually
right about you.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.263
Right about what?

23:52.265 --> 23:53.600
That you're a
naive fucking loser!

23:54.726 --> 23:55.892
- That's what.
- Did she say that?

23:55.894 --> 23:56.935
No, I made that up!

23:57.854 --> 23:59.103
What a cunt.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.354
What did you say?

24:00.356 --> 24:01.773
Cunt!

24:01.775 --> 24:04.277
Oh, you worthless
piece of shit.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.288
Rose, Rose, stop!

24:16.163 --> 24:17.622
Stop it!

24:17.624 --> 24:19.123
Rose, stop!

24:38.686 --> 24:39.520
Come here.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.775
You push me over?

24:45.777 --> 24:48.986
Is that your answer to
all of life's problems?

24:48.988 --> 24:49.823
Push me?

26:53.863 --> 26:54.739
Let's go back.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.283
Let's find the nearest
motel or something.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.547
I really want to stay.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.509
Really?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.886
Okay?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.557
Maybe not the whole week,

27:22.683 --> 27:25.809
but one night,
it's not that bad.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.019
No.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.603
Absolutely not.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.606
Out of the question.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.276
Is this really that bad?

27:33.278 --> 27:34.401
Yeah.

27:34.403 --> 27:35.238
Yeah, it is?

27:37.949 --> 27:40.033
You know, it's like a hundred
miles to the nearest motel.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.911
Do you really want
to drive that far?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.959
We've been driving all day.

27:48.999 --> 27:48.915
I'm pretty tired.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.377
I could fall asleep standing up.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.711
Aren't you tired?

27:52.713 --> 27:53.962
No.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.797
I would walk however
many miles it took

27:55.799 --> 27:57.176
to get out of this hellhole.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.317
Don't ash on the couch.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.182
No.

28:47.184 --> 28:48.392
No, no.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.393
Are you sure you
parked the car here?

28:49.395 --> 28:50.437
You saw me!

28:51.897 --> 28:54.149
This day is just
getting better and better.

28:55.151 --> 28:55.985
Oh, dammit.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.944
Oh, if I just...

28:58.946 --> 29:00.863
Why don't you speak up?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.073
What?

29:02.075 --> 29:03.242
Speak up so I can
hear what you're saying.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.121
Cool.

29:07.622 --> 29:10.081
I thought you
left an hour ago.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.665
I'm sorry, what?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.585
I thought I saw
your car drive away.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.920
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

29:15.922 --> 29:16.879
Really?

29:16.881 --> 29:18.046
Harry, did you lock the car?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.090
Of course I did.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.132
Are you sure?

29:20.134 --> 29:21.092
Yes!

29:21.094 --> 29:22.303
Show me the keys.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.180
Come on.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.474
Nope, great.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.307
Fucking idiot.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.892
Stupid can a person be.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.769
Fucking shit!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.982
Well don't just
stand there, call the police!

29:36.859 --> 29:38.860
No
reception, of course.

29:38.862 --> 29:39.696
Good.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.947
Do you have a phone
we could borrow?

29:42.949 --> 29:44.616
Sorry, I don't have a phone.

29:45.868 --> 29:46.952
Are you kidding me?

29:48.163 --> 29:49.286
I don't have anyone to call,

29:49.288 --> 29:50.830
so why would I have a phone?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.500
This
cannot be happening.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.628
Is there a bus we can take?

29:57.630 --> 29:58.921
I don't think so.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.300
It's like 80 miles to
the nearest bus station.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.302
You're on your on.

30:04.304 --> 30:05.761
Perfect.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.889
Rose, let's
just go back to the cabin.

30:07.891 --> 30:08.725
Um, no.

30:10.684 --> 30:14.187
Do you have a guest
cabin or room?

30:14.189 --> 30:15.813
Maybe.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.230
But I don't know you.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.776
And you could be
murderers, for all I know.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.945
Wouldn't even trust my
cat to sleep inside!

30:23.615 --> 30:25.530
What a fucking asshole!

30:25.532 --> 30:26.617
This is perfect.

30:32.749 --> 30:33.583
Let's go.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.376
You're gonna walk 80 miles?

30:37.378 --> 30:38.212
Yes.

30:39.798 --> 30:40.630
Let's go.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.881
We're not staying here!

30:41.883 --> 30:43.841
It's gonna take a
week to walk that far.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.639
We'll find someone on the way.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.851
Did we see
anybody on the way here?

31:04.614 --> 31:07.116
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

31:18.586 --> 31:20.795
Can you feel it?

31:20.797 --> 31:21.798
Feel what?

31:24.217 --> 31:25.051
The end.

31:25.969 --> 31:26.885
Please...

31:29.556 --> 31:32.517
- You and me.
- Don't talk about it.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.274
Do you remember when we met?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.281
Do you still feel the same?

31:48.450 --> 31:50.117
- As?
- As when we met.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.584
- Do you?
- I don't know.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.627
Everything's different now.

32:02.255 --> 32:04.421
- Then why did you come?
- Because you asked me to.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.259
Really, that's
the only reason?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.385
Basically, yeah.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.684
Well I think that's
a bad reason to come.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.936
And I think you've
been kind of selfish.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.270
And you've given us nothing

32:20.272 --> 32:21.607
but a hard time
this entire trip.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.401
Why don't you just say no?

32:25.403 --> 32:27.612
I don't really know.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.322
I mean, is this it?

32:29.324 --> 32:30.489
Are we breaking up?

32:30.491 --> 32:31.326
I don't know.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.290
I mean, believe it or
not, I still like you.

32:39.709 --> 32:41.959
And maybe a part of me just
doesn't want to be alone,

32:41.961 --> 32:44.921
but not in a selfish
way, I mean that

32:44.923 --> 32:48.298
in that I actually
like being around you.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.346
I enjoy being near you.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.311
I have been a complete
asshole, so I'm sorry.

33:11.324 --> 33:12.657
Say something.

33:12.659 --> 33:13.658
It's not love.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.370
What is love anyway?

33:16.496 --> 33:17.452
You're just afraid.

33:17.454 --> 33:18.664
I'm just trying to be honest.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.584
What are you thinking?

33:23.586 --> 33:25.922
I think this was a mistake.

36:33.150 --> 36:33.984
Harry?

36:37.237 --> 36:40.074
I think we should give
us another chance.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.540
You sure?

36:52.878 --> 36:53.712
Yeah.

38:03.532 --> 38:04.616
Be careful.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.786
What the hell?

38:07.911 --> 38:08.744
Ah!

38:08.746 --> 38:10.623
Oh, son of a bitch!

38:13.960 --> 38:14.793
Harry!

38:16.795 --> 38:18.795
Come on Harry, let's go!

38:18.797 --> 38:20.965
Get down, get down!

38:20.967 --> 38:22.302
Stay calm, stay calm!

38:23.677 --> 38:24.802
Are you okay?

38:24.804 --> 38:26.054
We gotta get this...

38:26.056 --> 38:27.597
Oh, shit!

38:27.599 --> 38:28.805
Get the fuck out of here!

38:28.807 --> 38:30.057
Hey!

38:30.059 --> 38:31.643
We do not know how many
of them are out there.

38:35.523 --> 38:36.356
Go, go, go!

38:36.358 --> 38:37.190
Under the table!

38:37.192 --> 38:38.025
Go go go go go!

38:40.402 --> 38:41.485
Shit!

38:41.487 --> 38:42.903
We gotta get out of here.

38:42.905 --> 38:43.739
Shh!

38:44.657 --> 38:45.867
Listen, listen.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.213
Oh shit!

39:43.215 --> 39:44.048
Go!

39:44.050 --> 39:44.884
Go go go go go!

39:51.056 --> 39:52.807
Alright, uh...

39:52.809 --> 39:54.519
We're gonna get
out of here, okay?

39:55.811 --> 39:57.896
All right, you first, go!

44:46.393 --> 44:47.227
Rose!

45:20.427 --> 45:22.763
What happened, is he gone?

45:23.889 --> 45:25.055
You're bleeding!

45:25.057 --> 45:25.889
Are you okay?

45:25.891 --> 45:26.768
I'm fine.

45:27.811 --> 45:28.644
Let's go.

46:03.304 --> 46:04.139
Nothing.

46:05.056 --> 46:06.349
I've seen nothing all day.

46:12.605 --> 46:14.440
What are you thinking?

46:16.650 --> 46:17.983
It had to be him.

46:17.985 --> 46:19.153
Of course it was him.

46:25.452 --> 46:27.659
Well, we should find
a way out of here.

46:27.661 --> 46:28.495
Yeah.

46:29.956 --> 46:32.459
I mean, there's got to
be a phone or a computer.

46:33.501 --> 46:34.336
Yeah, so?

46:44.304 --> 46:45.137
I'll go.

46:46.722 --> 46:47.889
You should stay here.

46:47.891 --> 46:49.476
Why?

46:50.643 --> 46:52.017
Because it could
still be dangerous

46:52.019 --> 46:55.148
and I think we should split up.

46:56.315 --> 46:57.317
That's your plan?

46:58.318 --> 46:59.983
Look, the car is over there.

46:59.985 --> 47:03.237
It's in a shed,
it's in a barn...

47:03.239 --> 47:04.655
You're not gonna find it.

47:04.657 --> 47:05.825
How could you be sure?

47:10.996 --> 47:11.830
Okay.

47:12.956 --> 47:14.624
You keep lookout.

47:14.626 --> 47:16.751
If you see anything,
just warn me.

47:16.753 --> 47:19.086
Give me a signal, something.

47:21.925 --> 47:22.759
A light.

47:24.552 --> 47:25.845
Do you have a better idea?

47:34.938 --> 47:35.771
Fine.

47:38.525 --> 47:39.358
Okay.

52:21.766 --> 52:22.599
Dammit!

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:09.916
Okay, all right, uh...

01:01:09.918 --> 01:01:12.338
Let's go, come on, come on...

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.220
Okay, okay...

01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:46.807
Help!

01:02:51.771 --> 01:02:53.021
Help!

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:53.856
Rose!

01:03:08.996 --> 01:03:09.830
Rose!

01:07:36.222 --> 01:07:37.057
Harry!

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:40.809
Harry!

01:07:42.228 --> 01:07:43.063
Harry!

01:07:44.313 --> 01:07:45.396
Harry...

01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:46.813
Harry!

01:07:46.815 --> 01:07:47.815
Harry!

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:04.833
Okay, okay...

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:13.467
Harry?

01:08:16.136 --> 01:08:16.970
Harry?

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:20.599
Harry!

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.019
Harry!

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.354
Harry!

01:09:10.483 --> 01:09:11.317
Harry!

01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:15.947
Harry!

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:17.990
Rose!

01:09:20.783 --> 01:09:21.618
Harry?

01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:24.245
Rose, I'm here!

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:25.497
Harry, Harry?

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:29.792
Is that you?

01:09:32.337 --> 01:09:34.296
- I'm here!
- Can you hear me?

01:09:34.298 --> 01:09:36.341
- Help me out of here!
- Harry!

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:38.844
Rose, I'm here!

01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:40.845
Harry!

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.350
- Rose!
- Harry, Harry!

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:48.227
Harry, can you hear me?

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.814
I'm here, I'm here!

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:53.273
Get me out of here.

01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:55.026
Harry!

01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:55.860
How'd you get down there?

01:09:55.862 --> 01:09:57.486
Is there a door?

01:09:57.488 --> 01:09:59.573
Yeah, yeah, there's a door.

01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:02.991
But I'm tied up.

01:10:02.993 --> 01:10:05.454
Okay, okay, I'm
gonna go find a knife.

01:10:07.039 --> 01:10:07.873
Please hurry!

01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:23.555
Rose!

01:10:26.225 --> 01:10:27.433
Rose!

01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:28.768
I found one.

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:29.977
Here, take this!

01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:31.898
- Okay.
- Here it comes.

01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:35.068
Okay, oh yeah.

01:10:36.027 --> 01:10:37.151
All right.

01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:39.736
I'm gonna go find a door.

01:10:39.738 --> 01:10:40.572
I'll go around.

01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:57.090
All right, I got it.

01:11:02.011 --> 01:11:02.845
Come on!

01:11:17.318 --> 01:11:18.651
Rose!

01:11:18.653 --> 01:11:19.652
Rose!

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:25.534
Harry!

01:11:27.037 --> 01:11:27.871
Rose!

01:11:29.247 --> 01:11:30.580
- Harry!
- Rose, I'm loose.

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:32.165
Okay, I can't get in!

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:40.380
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, all right.

01:11:40.382 --> 01:11:41.549
Come on.

01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:42.633
Oh no, are you okay?

01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:43.636
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:46.470
- I couldn't find the car.
- Okay.

01:11:46.472 --> 01:11:48.638
But there's a
motorcycle in the shed.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.848
I think the keys
are in the house.

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:51.642
Okay, but we don't
have much time.

01:11:51.644 --> 01:11:52.645
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:11:55.648 --> 01:11:57.317
All right, okay...

01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:06.199
All right, you got it?

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:09.160
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

01:12:09.162 --> 01:12:10.911
I think I should
take the first floor

01:12:10.913 --> 01:12:12.914
and you take the second.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.083
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:16.018
Harry, Harry, I got them!

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.854
Harry!

01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:21.859
Harry!

01:13:25.113 --> 01:13:25.947
Let's go!

01:13:33.787 --> 01:13:34.621
Watch out!

01:15:52.051 --> 01:15:53.177
I'm coming!

01:16:55.448 --> 01:16:58.451
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:18:24.537 --> 01:18:26.039
You know that we'll find you.

01:18:27.164 --> 01:18:29.167
It's just a matter of time.

01:19:07.663 --> 01:19:11.040
You know, I almost
feel a bit sorry

01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:12.419
for you and your boyfriend.

01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:17.716
But you know, life...

01:19:18.632 --> 01:19:19.466
Things happen.

01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:23.555
Good and bad things.

01:21:23.382 --> 01:21:24.549
Harry!

01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:25.549
Harry, no!

01:21:25.551 --> 01:21:26.844
Harry, Harry...

01:21:30.724 --> 01:21:31.557
Harry...

01:21:33.893 --> 01:21:34.978
No, I'm so...

01:21:37.396 --> 01:21:38.230
I'm sorry.
