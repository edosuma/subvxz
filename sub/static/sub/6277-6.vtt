[epic ambient music]

00:12.000 --> 00:13.458
Previously on Ray Donovan...

00:13.458 --> 00:14.583
Where the hell are you?

00:14.583 --> 00:15.792
I'm in Boston.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.041
You getting a divorce?

00:17.041 --> 00:18.834
I don't know.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.625
We're in with the Minassians
up to our fucking necks.

00:20.625 --> 00:21.917
Eh, we take 50.

00:21.917 --> 00:23.750
50 percent of the business?

00:23.750 --> 00:27.625
A partnership.
Accept?

00:27.625 --> 00:29.375
My brother's in prison.

00:29.375 --> 00:33.458
He killed another inmate.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.417
They're gonna kill him.

00:35.417 --> 00:38.709
My name is Thomas Romero.
I'm a servant of the Paraclete.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.583
Stan told me you got a
settlement.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.083
You beat the church.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.959
A priest messed around
with me when I was a kid.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.709
I ain't got no problem
with it.

00:46.709 --> 00:47.834
You're leaving?

00:47.834 --> 00:49.542
I go where Pablo
and them go.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.125
They ain't just my job,
they're my family.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.792
Tell me what to do
to keep you here.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.333
There's nothing you can do.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.583
I'm having a hard time
and I'm sorry if it's

00:57.583 --> 00:58.834
affecting my calculus.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.583
My boyfriend was murdered.

01:00.583 --> 01:01.834
I'm sorry.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.166
His wife died last year.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.291
She started getting
these headaches.

01:06.291 --> 01:09.166
Blood clot.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.834
Ray, we have
to make things right.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.375
Go fuck yourself.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.834
My daughter wants
to tear it to the ground

01:14.834 --> 01:15.959
and build a stadium there.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.750
Is that what you need
me for?

01:17.750 --> 01:19.792
No the Governor's taking care
of those details.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.208
We need to take care
of the Governor.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.792
Nice to meet you.

01:22.792 --> 01:23.875
Some guy's got a burner phone
that belongs

01:23.875 --> 01:25.875
to Governor Verona.
We gotta get it.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.875
Tom, it's Paige.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.542
Everyone's gone home.
I'm stretched out over my desk

01:29.542 --> 01:31.166
waiting for you.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.667
Does my father
know you have it?

01:32.667 --> 01:34.166
What'd you do to him?

01:34.166 --> 01:36.125
The better question is
what's he done to me?

01:36.125 --> 01:38.792
I'll give you the phone
for a piece of your NFL deal.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.041
Okay.

01:40.041 --> 01:44.375
Did you give my daughter
that phone?

01:44.375 --> 01:47.041
No.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.792
[male reporter]
Meg Townsend won't apologize

01:56.792 --> 01:58.875
for her choice
and that's shaking up the polls

01:58.875 --> 02:00.375
in today's election.

02:00.375 --> 02:03.166
Here's Governor Verona's
reaction.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.959
[female reporter]
Governor Verona?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.417
Governor Verona, sir?
Any comment on the news

02:07.417 --> 02:09.583
that the nanny did not
have a green card until

02:09.583 --> 02:11.667
after she worked
for her.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.166
I wouldn't let
an illegal immigrant

02:13.166 --> 02:14.500
raise my children.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.083
My wife raised my children.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.083
[male reporter]
Ms. Townsend,
would you care to comment?

02:19.083 --> 02:21.500
I am not ashamed that,
15 years ago, I gave

02:21.500 --> 02:23.417
an undocumented worker
the job of taking care

02:23.417 --> 02:25.875
of my daughter
while I, another single mom,

02:25.875 --> 02:28.375
went to the office.

02:28.375 --> 02:31.959
11 million undocumented workers
in this country are here

02:31.959 --> 02:35.709
to do the work
that no one else wants to do.

02:35.709 --> 02:38.083
They love freedom
and opportunity.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.709
Let me say that in Spanish.

02:40.709 --> 02:45.834
[speaking Spanish]

02:54.250 --> 02:56.166
And that's why I want
to reform immigration

02:56.166 --> 02:57.959
the minute I get into office.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.709
[tires squealing]

03:11.625 --> 03:13.667
All right, you wanted me here,
I'm here.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.959
Little early for a lap dance,
but, uh, what the fuck.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.917
Grandma wants to introduce
you to another one

03:22.917 --> 03:24.792
of our business partners.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.500
You guys own this?

03:41.166 --> 03:44.166
[high-pitched
mechanical whining]

03:49.500 --> 03:50.875
Can I get anybody a drink?

03:50.875 --> 03:52.542
Sure.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.208
No.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.458
This is business,
not cocktail hour.

03:57.458 --> 04:01.458
Mickey, I want you
to meet good friend.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.959
Old friend.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.208
George Markoff.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.375
George has been
a bad boy.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.041
I know I'm late,
all right,

04:10.041 --> 04:11.875
but we have
a variable rate mortgage

04:11.875 --> 04:13.041
and they jacked it up
this month.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.709
You know what it's like.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.709
Not really.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.542
He's three weeks late.

04:19.542 --> 04:23.333
What do you do in Boston
if somebody is late?

04:23.333 --> 04:24.875
You work it out.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.208
And what do you do
when they pay the bank on time,

04:28.208 --> 04:31.000
but not you?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.041
Depends on the relationship.

04:33.041 --> 04:36.542
This is a business
relationship...

04:36.542 --> 04:38.542
like I have with you, Mickey.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.375
[grunting]

04:53.250 --> 04:56.542
Aw, man, plea--
oh, God!

04:56.542 --> 04:59.250
[whimpers]

05:02.083 --> 05:05.250
You be a good boy, Mickey.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.125
[heavy breathing]

05:17.041 --> 05:19.959
- Good morning.
- Morning.

05:19.959 --> 05:21.333
How's everything here?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.208
You know, Southy's
gotten gentrified.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.917
I guess you can't
stop progress.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.542
Oh, and listen to this.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.458
Lauren's not
a little girl anymore.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.458
Her boyfriend gave her
the fucking clap.

05:44.959 --> 05:47.208
[spits]

05:47.208 --> 05:49.458
How much longer
is this gonna last, Ray?

05:53.959 --> 05:55.125
Why don't you say it?

05:55.125 --> 05:58.041
[spits]
Say what?

05:58.041 --> 06:00.250
Say you're never
gonna forgive me

06:00.250 --> 06:02.667
and let me get on
with my fucking life.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.291
[sighs]

06:11.291 --> 06:13.375
Do you want a divorce, Ray?

06:18.709 --> 06:23.041
If you want a divorce,
give me the house and the kids

06:23.041 --> 06:25.709
and you take the apartment
in Hollywood.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.208
[sniffs]

06:35.166 --> 06:39.417
We were very close,
Teresa and me.

06:43.417 --> 06:48.083
She saw things in me...

06:48.083 --> 06:51.041
I didn't even know were there.

06:51.041 --> 06:55.917
God, I wanted her to stay.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.375
But I couldn't keep her.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.208
And then her brother takes them
all to Bakersfield

07:02.208 --> 07:06.542
and she goes with him.

07:06.542 --> 07:09.750
Well, it's for
the best, Bunchy.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.208
She knew you weren't ready.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.875
Let's put 'em away, huh?

07:21.417 --> 07:25.041
[indistinct chatter]

07:25.041 --> 07:27.125
You love her, right?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.208
Yeah.

07:31.208 --> 07:35.458
Then you have to tell her.

07:35.458 --> 07:38.250
She's not gonna come back
from Bakersfield.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.709
Well, then you go there.

07:40.709 --> 07:45.083
Come on, I'll drive you.
I'm free today.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.125
I don't even know if she
really has feelings for me.

07:48.125 --> 07:53.250
Well, there's only one way
to find out, right?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.917
Let's do it.
Come on.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.750
[Audrey]
No, I don't wanna!

08:00.750 --> 08:03.083
[Ginger]
We can't stay here anymore.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.583
We have to go.

08:04.583 --> 08:05.834
[Audrey]
I want to stay here

08:05.834 --> 08:09.083
and be a movie star.

08:09.083 --> 08:12.125
Well, we can't.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.083
What's this?

08:14.083 --> 08:16.208
Where you going?

08:16.208 --> 08:18.709
Mrs. Rosenblatt
is threatening me

08:18.709 --> 08:21.917
with Child Protective Services
if I don't move out right away.

08:21.917 --> 08:24.625
So I'm taking Audrey
to Las Vegas,

08:24.625 --> 08:27.000
'cause I know that
there's work for me there.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.709
What?
No, no.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.583
Let me talk to her.

08:32.583 --> 08:37.083
Mick, she knows that
I sell drugs to men

08:37.083 --> 08:39.500
that I fuck
for money.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.041
If CPS comes around, I gotta--
I gotta have a real job,

08:43.041 --> 08:45.458
I gotta have Audrey in school.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.458
You know, you're under
a lot of stress.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.208
You don't want
to make a rash decision.

08:51.208 --> 08:54.500
Give it a day or two.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.208
Give it a day or two.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.667
You see, you have business
and you go where you

09:08.667 --> 09:11.625
didn't expect.
Lena's back with you?

09:11.625 --> 09:13.041
Yeah.

09:13.041 --> 09:14.500
You know I offered her
a better deal here.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.667
Everything she wanted,
but obviously,

09:17.667 --> 09:22.834
she likes to work
with you better.

09:22.834 --> 09:27.667
I think it's good to work
with people that you know.

09:27.667 --> 09:32.041
When you have a past,
a history.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.667
We had that, Ray.

09:34.667 --> 09:38.500
A lot more good than bad.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.667
What the fuck are you doing
in the hallway?

09:40.667 --> 09:44.291
Avi, you are looking
at a man on the way up.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.291
Say what it should say?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.208
Yep, she didn't screw
around with you.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.333
This is a sound contract.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.542
You got 3% of the deal.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.750
Paige Finney.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.583
How the fuck did you swing that?

10:09.583 --> 10:11.542
Ezra would have loved this.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.625
Whatever was between you
at the end,

10:13.625 --> 10:15.917
he knew you could go
wherever you wanted

10:15.917 --> 10:19.208
and here you are,
Mr. Football.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.792
Hut-hut, hike!

10:23.375 --> 10:27.083
Sign here, here, and here.

10:30.917 --> 10:32.291
[clears throat]

10:33.208 --> 10:36.709
And, uh, Ray...

10:36.709 --> 10:40.792
If the Finneys are unhappy
with their counsel...

10:50.250 --> 10:51.834
[cell phone rings]

10:56.417 --> 10:57.917
Yeah.

10:57.917 --> 11:01.041
- We gotta go to San Diego.
- Okay.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.458
Now.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.583
That rival bid's
coming in today.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.083
Henry Sylvester,

11:05.083 --> 11:07.083
fracking king
from North Dakota.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.834
And you want me to stop him.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.458
Paige has put a noon
deadline on the deal.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.291
So we're hoping
Mr. Sylvester does not make it.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.667
All right.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.834
[cell phone rings]

11:21.834 --> 11:23.458
Yeah.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.709
Guy named Henry Sylvester
is flying into San Diego.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.667
We need to get him
when he lands.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.083
All right, I'm on it.

11:30.083 --> 11:34.125
New member's first month's free,
$49.95 after that.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.208
Ah, that's too much.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.291
Well, we got a 90 day special.

11:38.291 --> 11:42.083
120, towels and lockers
are extra.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.166
Let me think about it.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.166
[phone ringing]

11:50.583 --> 11:53.709
Yeah, it's me.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.083
Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.208
Motherfucker.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.834
Did you see that guy
come into my office?

12:04.834 --> 12:07.583
Nah, I ain't seen
nobody in there.

12:07.583 --> 12:11.291
But I didn't see him
come in either.

12:11.291 --> 12:14.166
He came into
my fucking office.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.291
There's no problem.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.333
Just tell me what to do.
I'll take care of it.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.250
Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.625
Fuck.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.709
So I just give this
to my Bio teacher

12:32.709 --> 12:34.417
and I get out early?

12:34.417 --> 12:35.875
Yeah, and I'll see you
in the gym seventh period.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.291
Hey, what's that?

12:37.291 --> 12:39.542
The school gym is being used
as a polling station

12:39.542 --> 12:40.792
for the election today.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.709
I'm volunteering
to be a good citizen.

12:42.709 --> 12:43.750
- Mm.
- Important work,

12:43.750 --> 12:45.083
handing out stickers

12:45.083 --> 12:46.959
and putting away tables
when the polls close.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.375
Democracy in action.

12:48.375 --> 12:52.125
Can I do it too?

12:52.125 --> 12:54.834
I'll sign the form.

12:54.834 --> 12:58.291
[jet engine]

12:58.291 --> 13:01.917

28:19.125 --> 28:20.792
Yeah.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.792
You're gonna be late.

28:33.667 --> 28:38.500
[indistinct chatter]

28:45.166 --> 28:46.667
You got it?

28:46.667 --> 28:50.667
Yeah, yeah.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.917
What do I owe you?

28:52.917 --> 28:54.834
Figure that out later.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.500
Only got 9 bullets.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.166
You make do with what you got.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.291
We gotta lock the club down.

29:08.291 --> 29:09.625
Clear it out.

29:09.625 --> 29:10.709
What?

29:10.709 --> 29:12.709
Clear it.
You too.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.667
That don't make no sense,
Terry.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.291
Do it.

29:17.125 --> 29:18.875
All right.

29:26.041 --> 29:30.583
All right, listen up.
Club's closed.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.709
Good night, everybody.
Club's closed, let's go!

29:32.709 --> 29:35.208
Grab your stuff.
Time to go home.

29:41.834 --> 29:46.250
[mild chatter]

29:46.250 --> 29:48.166
Thanks for voting.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.959
Democracy salutes you, sir.

29:49.959 --> 29:51.208
Don't forget
your cookie.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.667
You have
a non-partisan choice

29:52.667 --> 29:55.083
of oatmeal raisin
and chocolate chip.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.917
Oatmeal raisin.
Excellent choice.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.834
[sighs]

30:11.625 --> 30:13.083
What are you doing here?

30:13.083 --> 30:14.375
I came to pick you up.
The office told me

30:14.375 --> 30:15.792
you were here.

30:15.792 --> 30:17.500
This is an extracurricular
activity.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.750
It's not over
till the polls close.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.417
I haven't talked to you
and you were so upset

30:21.417 --> 30:22.583
when you called.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.250
Mom, I just--
I had a freakout.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.375
Everything's fine.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.583
I shouldn't have left you.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.208
You had to go.

30:30.208 --> 30:32.792
It was the right thing to do.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.125
Your father asked me
out tonight.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.458
Good.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.125
To meet the Governor.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.125
No way!
Go!

30:42.125 --> 30:44.166
I wanted to be home tonight
to talk to you.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.083
Wake me up when you get home.
I want to hear about the party.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.166
Go.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.792
Love you.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.709
[sniffs]

31:05.792 --> 31:08.166
Oh, my God, you're stoned.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.542
Want some?
I've got Green Crack.

31:10.542 --> 31:12.375
Not that I'm trying
to propose anything,

31:12.375 --> 31:14.125
but it is so good for sex.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.166
[giggles]

31:15.166 --> 31:16.792
Let's go.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.000
We're supposed to be
good citizens.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.166
You can be stoned
and a good citizen.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.500
Look at Seth Rogen.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.458
[both giggling]

31:23.458 --> 31:26.041
Hey, Mr. D, I've got cramps
and Bridget has to come with me.

31:26.041 --> 31:27.750
I need moral support.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.500
It's a break, not a vacation.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
We just bought a fucking
football team, Ray.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
How does it feel?

31:36.500 --> 31:37.709
Too soon to tell.

31:37.709 --> 31:38.917
Oh, come on,
enjoy yourself.

31:38.917 --> 31:40.125
So many people have tried
to do this.

31:40.125 --> 31:42.625
Ovitz, Spanos, Kroenke.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.041
We beat them all.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.291
The envelope you gave
your father at the studio.

31:52.291 --> 31:56.250
What was in it?

31:56.250 --> 31:57.834
A love letter.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.083
From who to who?

32:00.083 --> 32:05.041
[sighs] From my father
to my husband.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.709
Your husband?

32:06.709 --> 32:09.667
It was a break-up letter.

32:09.667 --> 32:11.500
Varick never threw it away.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.500
Your father and your husband?

32:13.500 --> 32:17.458
That was the deal,
the letter for the team.

32:20.458 --> 32:23.250
That can't be easy.

32:26.542 --> 32:29.083
That's my life.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.750
My wife is back.

32:51.083 --> 32:54.583
I shouldn't have told her
about the abuse.

32:54.583 --> 32:57.041
No, it's good.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.959
Starts your relationship out
in honesty.

32:59.959 --> 33:03.959
I'm never gonna have that.

33:03.959 --> 33:06.125
Love of a good woman.

33:06.125 --> 33:09.208
If I can...

33:09.208 --> 33:12.083
believe me, anyone can.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.917
[scoffs]

33:13.917 --> 33:16.583
My abuser destroyed me.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.917
He ruined my life.

33:18.917 --> 33:22.417
I ruined his life.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.000
I'm going to hell.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.625
Am I in hell?

33:26.625 --> 33:27.917
No.

33:27.917 --> 33:30.583
You're one of
the good guys.

33:30.583 --> 33:33.583
I shot him.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.667
[whispering]
Shot who?

33:35.667 --> 33:39.750
My abuser.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.417
You killed him?

33:41.417 --> 33:43.834
Partly.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.875
What?

33:45.875 --> 33:50.208
He abused my brother
Ray, too.

33:50.208 --> 33:53.500
Ray was there.

33:53.500 --> 33:58.542
I shot him in the stomach
and Ray shot him in the head.

34:02.125 --> 34:05.709
And I don't regret it
for a fucking second.

34:07.834 --> 34:10.542
Not anymore.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.583
[sighs]

34:15.583 --> 34:18.500
Thank you for telling me that.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.667
[engine turning over]

34:42.667 --> 34:46.250
[breathing shakily]

34:50.709 --> 34:53.083
[muffled shouting outside]

35:23.333 --> 35:28.125
So what's the deal again
with this party tonight, Ray?

35:28.125 --> 35:32.875
Governor,
your new boss...

35:32.875 --> 35:34.250
What's going on with you?

35:38.583 --> 35:41.208
I met Bridget at school
the other day.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.125
You know, helping her
with that college stuff?

35:46.750 --> 35:48.417
I don't know.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.709
It's like we don't know
each other anymore, you know?

35:51.709 --> 35:54.583
Are you kidding me?
She fucking loves you.

35:56.208 --> 35:58.083
I've been wiping blood
off the floor

35:58.083 --> 36:02.834
for too fucking long.

36:02.834 --> 36:06.750
Tired of fixing things
for people who don't deserve it.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.625
[breathes deeply]

36:08.625 --> 36:10.291
It's gotta change.

36:14.125 --> 36:16.333
Is that why you sold
your business?

36:18.750 --> 36:20.125
Yeah.

36:22.166 --> 36:23.375
Look, Abs...

36:27.333 --> 36:31.041
I'm working on getting
a piece of an NFL team.

36:31.041 --> 36:35.542
Small, but real.

36:35.542 --> 36:37.250
Wow.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.709
Couple of loose ends,
but if I pull this off,

36:39.709 --> 36:42.458
could change everything.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.667
Holy shit.

36:44.667 --> 36:45.834
[laughs]

36:50.250 --> 36:52.959
Means a lot to me
you're coming tonight.

36:52.959 --> 36:54.709
Of course.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.458
[coughs]

37:02.458 --> 37:03.667
Oh, yeah.

37:03.667 --> 37:04.834
[giggles]

37:04.834 --> 37:06.709
So...

37:06.709 --> 37:08.000
Do you even care who wins?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.500
Fuck no.
I just signed up

37:09.500 --> 37:11.667
because I wanted
to get out of class early.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.000
And you?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.834
- Community service.
- Uh-huh.

37:14.834 --> 37:16.041
For real, I mean,
it looks really good

37:16.041 --> 37:17.458
on your college application.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.000
Three hours pushing cookies
in a high school gym

37:19.000 --> 37:20.583
gets you into Stanford?

37:20.583 --> 37:21.875
I'm glad to know
that's why you're here.

37:21.875 --> 37:24.083
Otherwise...

37:24.083 --> 37:25.291
What?

37:25.291 --> 37:26.542
You like him.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.834
Who?

37:27.834 --> 37:29.542
Don't who me.
Donellen.

37:29.542 --> 37:30.667
You're hot for him.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.291
And you're stoned.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.375
I am stoned and you want
to fuck Donellen.

37:34.375 --> 37:37.041
I mean, it's a girls school.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.417
If they want to keep us
from boys,

37:38.417 --> 37:40.417
they shouldn't send us boys
as teachers.

37:46.083 --> 37:49.709
The police ever talk to you?

37:49.709 --> 37:51.875
No.

37:51.875 --> 37:54.834
No eye-witness,
so to speak.

37:54.834 --> 37:58.875
[chuckles]

37:58.875 --> 38:00.709
What about you?

38:00.709 --> 38:03.542
Nah.
Me neither.

38:23.667 --> 38:24.709
You're here.

38:24.709 --> 38:26.750
I got a few conditions.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.583
Okay.

38:28.583 --> 38:29.917
You don't lie to me.

38:29.917 --> 38:31.834
You don't cheat on me.

38:31.834 --> 38:32.917
You don't hit me.

38:32.917 --> 38:34.792
Never.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.125
I'm not running away with
any gabacho  named Bunchy.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.458
That's a puppy's name.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.709
Your name is Brendan.

38:41.709 --> 38:46.750
Okay, Brendan?

38:46.750 --> 38:48.667
Brendan.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.458
Sure.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.417
And I'm not running to the
fucking wedding chapel with you.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.792
That's a longer discussion.

38:57.792 --> 39:01.375
Okay.
That's fair.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.000
[sighs and
clears throat]

39:10.000 --> 39:11.375
[elevator bell rings]

39:13.458 --> 39:15.625
Something happened
in Boston.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.291
What?

39:17.291 --> 39:18.959
What's going on
with my family.

39:18.959 --> 39:23.166
Or not going on.

39:23.166 --> 39:27.208
I was wondering if
maybe, I don't know,

39:27.208 --> 39:31.041
we could buy the bar
from them?

39:31.041 --> 39:34.959
I don't see why not.
Help 'em out.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.250
Really?

39:40.500 --> 39:42.375
I'll talk to Harriet about it.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.500
[elevator bell rings]

39:52.375 --> 39:55.875
[indistinct chatter]

40:01.792 --> 40:03.250
Excuse me.

40:08.291 --> 40:11.959
Well, Ray,
how's your brother doing?

40:11.959 --> 40:14.166
Better, thank you, sir.

40:14.166 --> 40:16.083
This is Abby, my wife.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.625
Abby, this is
Governor Verona.

40:17.625 --> 40:18.834
Tom to my friends.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.291
Pleasure.

40:20.291 --> 40:22.083
Are you going
to introduce me, Governor?

40:22.083 --> 40:23.750
Have you met Andrew Finney?

40:23.750 --> 40:25.041
Not yet.

40:25.041 --> 40:26.625
You must be Abby.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.917
Abby Donovan, yes.

40:27.917 --> 40:30.375
The Beast brings his Beauty.

40:30.375 --> 40:31.792
[chuckles]

40:31.792 --> 40:33.375
Can we get you anything else?

40:33.375 --> 40:35.125
No, I'm good, thanks.

40:35.125 --> 40:37.000
Casey, come over here.
I want you to meet someone.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.667
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.542
You as well.

40:40.542 --> 40:43.750
Abby Donovan, my son,
Casey Finney.

40:43.750 --> 40:46.041
Oh, my God,
I saw you on the news.

40:46.041 --> 40:47.709
Your husband saved my life.

40:47.709 --> 40:49.083
He--

40:51.750 --> 40:53.166
He didn't tell me.

40:53.166 --> 40:55.417
Well, he doesn't say much.

40:55.417 --> 40:56.959
No.

40:56.959 --> 40:58.375
He's been that way
since I met him.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.208
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.875
- Excuse me.
- Mm.

41:03.875 --> 41:07.208
So...

41:07.208 --> 41:09.250
Are you really
a billionaire?

41:09.250 --> 41:10.500
Yep.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.125
As of tonight, hmm?

41:12.125 --> 41:13.625
[laughter]

41:13.625 --> 41:15.709
Scotch, please.

41:15.709 --> 41:17.667
Hey.

41:17.667 --> 41:21.959
It's been my wife's dream to buy
an NFL team for a long time.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.417
She seems to think it would
have happened without you.

41:24.417 --> 41:26.792
She says the same thing
about you.

41:26.792 --> 41:28.792
I just hope Verona's
ridiculous comment this morning

41:28.792 --> 41:31.458
about the Latinos
doesn't fuck things up.

41:33.667 --> 41:35.792
Mrs. Donovan,
Paige Finney.

41:35.792 --> 41:38.625
- Excuse me.
- So nice to finally meet you.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.542
How was Boston?

41:40.542 --> 41:43.291
Wet and cold?

41:43.291 --> 41:46.041
Paige and I
work together.

41:46.041 --> 41:47.709
Then she should call me Abby.

41:47.709 --> 41:49.291
Boston was great.

41:49.291 --> 41:51.542
- Pit stop at the bar?
- Absolutely.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.333
How you doing, Casey?

41:56.333 --> 41:58.625
Yeah, good.

41:58.625 --> 42:02.709
Should tune the violins, Ray.
The ship is going down.

42:02.709 --> 42:04.750
What's that supposed to mean?

42:04.750 --> 42:08.291
[indistinct whispers]

42:08.291 --> 42:12.667
