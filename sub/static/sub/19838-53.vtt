<b>Hey, Youpi!</b>

00:08.660 --> 00:11.150
<b>I'm over here, fool!</b>

00:15.600 --> 00:20.310
<b><i>I'm telling him that there's one 
more enemy to worry about?</i></b>

00:21.740 --> 00:23.250
<b><i>That's fine.</i></b>

00:24.040 --> 00:27.500
<b><i>That will serve to distract Youpi,</i></b>

00:27.500 --> 00:29.990
<b><i>and it will save Shoot.</i></b>

01:51.000 --> 01:56.050
<b>Duty x And x Question</b>

02:02.120 --> 02:03.610
<b>"Hagya-sama."</b>

02:03.610 --> 02:06.830
<b>Ikalgo didn't realize that the name 
he had spoken with full confidence</b>

02:07.190 --> 02:11.160
<b>had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,</b>

02:11.430 --> 02:14.200
<b>as he headed beneath the palace</b>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.670
<b>to search for Palm.</b>

02:42.980 --> 02:44.560
<b><i>Satellite Dragonflies!</i></b>

02:50.860 --> 02:54.610
<b>Ikalgo knew Palm only through the 
information he had been given.</b>

02:55.280 --> 02:57.670
<b>However, he was already firm in his resolve</b>

02:57.670 --> 03:02.610
<b>that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her.</b>

03:04.120 --> 03:05.870
<b><i>I'm gonna rescue her.</i></b>

03:06.370 --> 03:08.120
<b><i>Palm is a friend of a friend.</i></b>

03:09.600 --> 03:10.870
<b><i>That makes her a friend...</i></b>

03:11.970 --> 03:13.620
<b><i>My friend!</i></b>

03:16.900 --> 03:20.060
<b>Palm was risking her life.</b>

03:20.060 --> 03:23.430
<b>That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.</b>

03:30.970 --> 03:33.340
<b><i>I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.</i></b>

03:35.810 --> 03:37.000
<b><i>I want to help her...</i></b>

03:39.370 --> 03:41.650
<b><i>Because I decided I would help her!</i></b>

03:44.500 --> 03:46.660
<b>The elevator leading underground</b>

03:47.140 --> 03:50.920
<b>was equipped with a security camera and a scale.</b>

03:51.290 --> 03:52.920
<b>After arriving underground,</b>

03:52.920 --> 03:55.670
<b>it would confirm that there was nothing inside</b>

03:55.670 --> 03:57.710
<b>before automatically returning to the surface.</b>

03:58.770 --> 04:01.320
<b>Any number of people could descend at once,</b>

04:01.320 --> 04:04.180
<b>but only one could ascend at a time.</b>

04:04.180 --> 04:08.060
<b>And a pass code had to be entered.</b>

04:08.400 --> 04:11.830
<b>The eight-digit code varied per person, 
and could be used to identify</b>

04:11.830 --> 04:14.190
<b>who had used the elevator.</b>

04:14.770 --> 04:17.680
<b>If the user's height and weight 
do not match the data</b>

04:17.680 --> 04:23.390
<b>on record from the time the code 
was assigned, a warning sounded,</b>

04:23.390 --> 04:26.150
<b>and the elevator became a prison.</b>

04:27.830 --> 04:32.200
<b>On the first entry of an incorrect code, 
a warning sounded, and the doors locked.</b>

04:33.380 --> 04:37.060
<b>Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,</b>

04:37.060 --> 04:40.690
<b>the elevator filled with sleeping gas, 
and the violator was captured and tortured.</b>

04:41.110 --> 04:43.700
<b>In other words, a third error meant death.</b>

04:50.170 --> 04:56.710
<b>Both the violator and the code's 
original owner would be killed,</b>

04:56.990 --> 05:00.000
<b>making one's code as valuable as one's own life.</b>

05:01.480 --> 05:04.170
<b>And the only code holders</b>

05:04.170 --> 05:07.630
<b>able to use the elevator without 
any such restriction</b>

05:07.630 --> 05:09.870
<b>were Bizeff and Marcos.</b>

05:11.600 --> 05:16.290
<b>That was because the elevator 
was a more convenient means</b>

05:16.290 --> 05:19.530
<b>of smuggling in various things, including humans,</b>

05:19.530 --> 05:22.880
<b>than the cargo entrance, 
which was watched by soldiers.</b>

05:37.700 --> 05:39.700
<b><i>What is this smell?!</i></b>

05:40.220 --> 05:44.280
<b><i>Has Flutter been living in the morgue?</i></b>

05:49.150 --> 05:53.670
<b><i>I can also smell Bro, since he was</i></b>

05:53.670 --> 05:56.050
<b><i>the last one in here before me.</i></b>

05:57.270 --> 06:01.290
<b><i>Damn, there's something else, very faint...</i></b>

06:02.360 --> 06:06.360
<b>The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served</b>

06:06.360 --> 06:08.580
<b>to dull Welfin's sense of smell.</b>

06:09.940 --> 06:13.180
<b><i>Since Bro followed Flutter underground,</i></b>

06:14.180 --> 06:18.080
<b><i>he must have also noticed that Flutter 
used the name "Hagya-sama."</i></b>

06:19.910 --> 06:23.490
<b><i>Or is Brovada conspiring with him?</i></b>

06:26.580 --> 06:29.760
<b><i>When I was watching the intruder,</i></b>

06:31.420 --> 06:35.000
<b><i>was Bro watching me from behind?</i></b>

06:38.010 --> 06:41.930
<b><i>If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,</i></b>

06:41.930 --> 06:46.380
<b><i>then he must have seen that 
I noticed Flutter's odd behavior...</i></b>

06:47.170 --> 06:51.360
<b><i>So, he went down first...</i></b>

06:54.370 --> 06:58.030
<b><i>In order to ambush me!</i></b>

07:01.140 --> 07:03.390
<b><i>Damn, this is my chance!</i></b>

07:05.260 --> 07:07.760
<b><i>Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.</i></b>

07:07.760 --> 07:11.310
<b><i>If I can pass him off him as the 
bomb threat's perpetrator,</i></b>

07:12.100 --> 07:16.250
<b><i>Bizeff will be indebted to me!</i></b>

07:17.280 --> 07:18.250
<b><i>Bizeff!</i></b>

07:20.890 --> 07:22.100
<b><i>Where's Bizeff?</i></b>

07:23.510 --> 07:24.670
<b><i>This is bad...</i></b>

07:25.830 --> 07:30.860
<b><i>If he dies during the attack, 
my plans will be ruined!</i></b>

07:31.680 --> 07:35.870
<b><i>Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!</i></b>

07:43.530 --> 07:44.560
<b>Yo.</b>

07:45.500 --> 07:46.710
<b><i>Grandpa...</i></b>

07:54.140 --> 07:55.770
<b><i>He's changed.</i></b>

07:59.850 --> 08:02.960
<b>My job here is done.</b>

08:03.380 --> 08:06.290
<b>I know nothing beyond the mission I received.</b>

08:09.300 --> 08:12.930
<b>I'll let you draw your own conclusions 
about what's happening inside.</b>

08:14.340 --> 08:15.280
<b>Inside?</b>

08:20.710 --> 08:23.420
<b>Swallowing the words he wanted to say,</b>

08:24.290 --> 08:26.680
<b>Zeno disappeared into the darkness.</b>

08:43.540 --> 08:48.000
<b>Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,</b>

08:48.650 --> 08:54.890
<b>Knuckle has revealed himself, a move 
that was not part of the original plan.</b>

08:55.990 --> 08:58.510
<b>Meleoron and Shoot</b>

08:59.570 --> 09:01.370
<b>could only hold their breaths.</b>

09:10.060 --> 09:12.230
<b>Bring it!</b>

09:16.700 --> 09:18.620
<b>Bring it!</b>

09:27.710 --> 09:31.130
<b>I see... Then this is yours.</b>

09:32.620 --> 09:33.780
<b>It's time.</b>

09:34.300 --> 09:35.930
<b>Adding interest.</b>

09:38.650 --> 09:40.500
<b>The number increased?</b>

10:07.410 --> 10:09.650
<b>My attacks won't work?</b>

10:10.220 --> 10:11.790
<b>What is this thing?</b>

10:15.160 --> 10:16.340
<b>Don't you run!</b>

10:16.340 --> 10:17.550
<b>Answer me!</b>

10:18.100 --> 10:19.530
<b>What is this thing?!</b>

10:24.290 --> 10:28.610
<b>I ain't gonna tell you, fool!</b>

10:28.610 --> 10:31.580
<b>If you wanna know, catch me first!</b>

10:43.770 --> 10:47.580
<b><i>Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...</i></b>

10:48.240 --> 10:53.960
<b><i>I can't weave through those 
blades of death to get to him!</i></b>

10:55.600 --> 10:59.790
<b><i>In that case, I'll walk at a pace 
that's neither fast nor slow,</i></b>

10:59.790 --> 11:03.100
<b><i>to conserve as much oxygen as possible!</i></b>

11:31.100 --> 11:35.610
<b><i>I must not lose consciousness...</i></b>

11:36.010 --> 11:38.010
<b><i>If I pass out,</i></b>

11:39.420 --> 11:44.010
<b><i>Hotel Rafflesia will stop...</i></b>

11:45.470 --> 11:52.970
<b><i>Every little bit of damage counts...</i></b>

12:04.920 --> 12:09.910
<b><i>I can still fight...</i></b>

12:11.240 --> 12:14.520
<b><i>I can still...</i></b>

12:35.530 --> 12:39.410
<b><i>I can't... I just can't say it!</i></b>

12:41.160 --> 12:44.820
<b><i>I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!</i></b>

12:52.020 --> 12:56.330
<b><i>Right now, my job...</i></b>

12:57.430 --> 13:00.300
<b><i>isn't to help Shoot!</i></b>

13:02.970 --> 13:06.120
<b><i>It's to use my power to help the others,</i></b>

13:06.120 --> 13:10.090
<b><i>so they can complete their 
missions as fast as possible!</i></b>

13:10.970 --> 13:13.980
<b><i>You have to survive, Shoot!</i></b>

13:14.830 --> 13:17.400
<b><i>Don't die!</i></b>

13:31.790 --> 13:33.550
<b><i>No one's here.</i></b>

13:37.920 --> 13:39.520
<b><i>Stay calm...</i></b>

13:39.520 --> 13:41.720
<b><i>Look around carefully.</i></b>

13:44.430 --> 13:48.640
<b><i>If I'm caught, I can still pretend 
to be on their side.</i></b>

13:50.010 --> 13:51.200
<b><i>However...</i></b>

13:51.960 --> 13:55.860
<b><i>That might not work, depending on who I run into.</i></b>

13:58.330 --> 14:01.220
<b><i>Perfect Plan... Undo!</i></b>

14:09.470 --> 14:10.410
<b><i>Okay!</i></b>

14:10.910 --> 14:11.830
<b><i>Activate!</i></b>

14:21.470 --> 14:25.960
<b><i>That's Morel's Smoky Jail.</i></b>

14:25.960 --> 14:27.270
<b><i>Which means...</i></b>

14:27.800 --> 14:32.300
<b><i>Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne 
room, with no possibility of interruption!</i></b>

14:33.410 --> 14:36.280
<b><i>That only leaves...</i></b>

14:36.670 --> 14:38.850
<b><i>Gon and Killua!</i></b>

14:42.330 --> 14:45.780
<b><i>Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?</i></b>

14:47.090 --> 14:49.030
<b><i>Which way did they go?</i></b>

14:58.920 --> 15:00.180
<b><i>Welfin?!</i></b>

15:01.310 --> 15:02.330
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

15:03.340 --> 15:05.660
<b><i>He's tough to deal with...</i></b>

15:05.660 --> 15:08.620
<b><i>He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!</i></b>

15:08.620 --> 15:12.590
<b><i>Once he suspects you, he won't 
trust you again until you're dead!</i></b>

15:18.400 --> 15:22.020
<b><i>I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?</i></b>

15:22.480 --> 15:24.020
<b><i>Which way do I go?</i></b>

15:26.470 --> 15:28.890
<b><i>What if he goes the same way?</i></b>

15:31.080 --> 15:32.570
<b><i>Do I wait for him to leave?</i></b>

15:34.340 --> 15:36.420
<b><i>Can I hold my breath that much longer?</i></b>

15:40.760 --> 15:43.080
<b><i>No... I can't hold it!</i></b>

15:44.340 --> 15:45.800
<b><i>I'm at my limit!</i></b>

15:58.170 --> 16:02.170
<b><i>I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!</i></b>

16:02.760 --> 16:04.960
<b><i>Perfect Plan, undo!</i></b>

16:09.840 --> 16:12.580
<b><i>Now inhale...</i></b>

16:12.580 --> 16:13.960
<b><i>Activate!</i></b>

16:18.680 --> 16:21.790
<b><i>For a second, I sensed something.</i></b>

16:31.540 --> 16:32.460
<b>The enemy?</b>

16:34.780 --> 16:39.850
<b>Welfin's power reflected his very nature,</b>

16:39.850 --> 16:43.300
<b>channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon.</b>

16:44.980 --> 16:48.520
<b>Egg Man 
Missile Man</b>

16:45.810 --> 16:46.900
<b><i>Missile Man!</i></b>

16:49.070 --> 16:51.960
<b>If anyone's hiding behind the building,</b>

16:51.960 --> 16:55.790
<b>surrender and show yourself by 
the time I count down from three!</b>

16:56.970 --> 16:59.560
<b>If you don't, I'll attack!</b>

17:04.550 --> 17:05.590
<b>Three!</b>

17:08.060 --> 17:09.070
<b>Two!</b>

17:11.610 --> 17:12.530
<b>One!</b>

17:15.640 --> 17:17.340
<b>Fire!</b>

17:30.620 --> 17:33.110
<b><i>No one's there... Did I imagine it?</i></b>

17:34.300 --> 17:38.150
<b>To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target</b>

17:38.150 --> 17:41.160
<b>and loads ammo in the form 
of questions or commands.</b>

17:41.160 --> 17:45.830
<b>If someone answers falsely or disobeys, 
the attack is launched.</b>

17:47.210 --> 17:52.840
<b>By the time Welfin noticed a presence, 
Meleoron had already moved.</b>

17:53.360 --> 17:56.640
<b>Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,</b>

17:56.640 --> 18:01.900
<b>his attack would have succeeded, 
despite his inability to detect his target.</b>

18:02.470 --> 18:06.200
<b>Finding nothing fitting the target's 
description, the attack failed.</b>

18:08.050 --> 18:13.360
<b>Once fired, Missile Man will 
pursue its target until it hits.</b>

18:13.920 --> 18:17.500
<b>No one can survive the impact.</b>

18:18.930 --> 18:24.160
<b>However, Welfin understood that 
his ability wasn't omnipotent.</b>

18:24.980 --> 18:28.640
<b>His power was nothing more than a tool.</b>

18:29.130 --> 18:33.990
<b>Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.</b>

18:33.990 --> 18:37.800
<b>He sought to become the king behind the scenes,</b>

18:37.800 --> 18:43.180
<b>because being the real king would mean
 he'd have too much to be suspicious of.</b>

18:44.760 --> 18:46.560
<b><i>It was my imagination?</i></b>

18:48.310 --> 18:50.560
<b><i>No, wait...</i></b>

18:55.840 --> 18:58.780
<b><i>I smell odorless deodorant...</i></b>

19:00.160 --> 19:02.200
<b><i>You can't fool my nose.</i></b>

19:03.100 --> 19:06.310
<b><i>Someone was here! I know it!</i></b>

19:06.800 --> 19:10.830
<b><i>Since I could only sense them for a moment, 
they must be very skilled.</i></b>

19:11.790 --> 19:16.730
<b><i>The use of deodorant confirms 
that they're aware of my nose.</i></b>

19:17.320 --> 19:21.470
<b><i>This confirms that there are traitors among us!</i></b>

19:22.950 --> 19:24.900
<b><i>There are others besides Flutter?</i></b>

19:25.520 --> 19:27.100
<b><i>The answer is probably yes!</i></b>

19:27.860 --> 19:30.970
<b><i>And it's someone I know...</i></b>

19:31.420 --> 19:33.890
<b><i>That's why they're hiding their scent.</i></b>

19:35.470 --> 19:36.400
<b><i>Who is it?</i></b>

19:38.130 --> 19:40.160
<b><i>They don't want to fight me?</i></b>

19:41.840 --> 19:43.740
<b><i>Because they can take me out at any time?</i></b>

19:55.610 --> 19:56.570
<b><i>Do I...</i></b>

19:57.590 --> 19:58.570
<b><i>Do I...</i></b>

20:02.650 --> 20:04.280
<b><i>Do I really</i></b>

20:04.920 --> 20:07.020
<b><i>want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?</i></b>

20:08.700 --> 20:11.660
<b><i>Should I really be</i></b>

20:13.110 --> 20:16.620
<b><i>searching for Bizeff now?</i></b>

20:21.310 --> 20:26.490
<b>As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives...</b>

21:02.880 --> 21:08.530
<b>Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou,</b>

21:09.280 --> 21:13.010
<b>their target for avenging Kite.</b>

23:24.660 --> 23:27.230
<b>Next time: Revenge x And x Recovery.</b>

23:27.230 --> 23:28.120
<b>Meleoron!</b>

23:28.120 --> 23:28.810
<b>Ikalgo.</b>

23:28.810 --> 23:29.630
<b>Knuckle!</b>

23:29.630 --> 23:30.340

<b>Killua...</b>

23:33.890 --> 23:35.960
<b>No matter what happens, always have faith.</b>
