01:57.160 --> 01:59.245
- We have to.
- No, no, Maddie!

01:59.329 --> 02:00.330
You didn't push him.

02:00.413 --> 02:02.081
And you didn't.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.500
Nobody did this.

02:03.583 --> 02:04.583
Nobody did this.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.495
High intensity.
It's the new workout craze.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.374
Are they gonna get divorced?

03:28.042 --> 03:29.042
No.

03:30.879 --> 03:32.213
He seems mad.

03:32.297 --> 03:35.174
Well, that must mean
that he loves her a lot, right?

03:41.014 --> 03:42.140
But you like him.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.559
Yeah, I do.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.352
Do you love him, though?

03:46.436 --> 03:47.520
I think you do.

03:49.564 --> 03:50.564
I don't really...

03:51.608 --> 03:54.152
know him well enough to love him.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.196
Love is a really big word, you know?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.073
But he makes you happy.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.326
You're like a whole other person.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.786
Your whole face and stuff
has been different.

04:05.455 --> 04:10.251
Well, I know that the three of us
can be friends for a long time.

04:10.335 --> 04:12.211
I want you to be with him.

04:13.546 --> 04:14.672
Ziggy...

04:15.840 --> 04:17.800
And I think you wanna be with him too.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.599
Last one to the bottom is a rotten egg!

04:44.327 --> 04:45.453
Double Americano.

04:45.536 --> 04:49.666
All right. Double Americano. Would you
like me to leave room for milk?

04:49.749 --> 04:52.752
- Americanos don't have milk.
- Some like milk in their Americanos.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.128
It's espresso and hot water.

04:54.212 --> 04:56.297
Do I need to come back there
and make it myself?

04:56.381 --> 04:57.757
No, no. It's fine.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.760
- Renata?
- Thank you.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.345
Oh.

05:02.595 --> 05:04.222
How are we today?

05:04.305 --> 05:05.390
How are we?

05:06.641 --> 05:07.892
- We...
- Hi.

05:07.976 --> 05:10.603
are wrought, Mary Louise.

05:12.563 --> 05:18.236
- We are worried about a wonderful mother
- Hm.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.071
who's being put through an onerous,

05:20.154 --> 05:23.533
if not despicably cruel, court procedure
to, what?

05:23.616 --> 05:26.661
Get to be with her own kids?
We're wrought.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.496
You're a good friend to her.

05:28.579 --> 05:33.418
And Celeste is very, very lucky
to have such a strong support system.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.669
And I sometimes think

05:34.752 --> 05:37.797
that if she hadn't tried
to take on so much alone,

05:37.880 --> 05:40.508
you know,
she wouldn't have unraveled so.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.010
She hasn't unraveled.

05:42.093 --> 05:45.179
She's a single mom and a widow
with two kids.

05:45.263 --> 05:46.472
She's done a damn good job.

05:46.556 --> 05:49.350
So I encouraged a housekeeper.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.185
Or a nanny.

05:51.269 --> 05:55.231
She thinks nannies are too much trouble.
More trouble than they're worth sometimes.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.108
- What did you just say?
- Just a mint tea.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.735
- What did you just say?
- A mint tea.

05:58.818 --> 06:02.030
This is exactly what you did
the last time you were at my house.

06:02.113 --> 06:05.867
Stay-at-home moms who make me feel
like I should be locked up?

06:05.950 --> 06:07.660
- No, you shouldn't.
- What, for neglect?

06:07.744 --> 06:09.162
Because I have a fucking career?

06:09.245 --> 06:15.084
I have spent every day of my goddamn life
putting my family and my child first.

06:15.168 --> 06:16.377
So don't go there.

06:16.461 --> 06:18.713
- Don't go there, judgy judger.
- I'm...

06:18.796 --> 06:21.466
Keep your eyes
on your own fucking paper, Mary Louise.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.011
Put it in a bag.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.137
I'll take it to her.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.139
Because we're going to the same...

06:28.222 --> 06:31.184
With you questioning her,
she can come at you directly.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.977
She can bait you, provoke you...

06:33.061 --> 06:34.520
I've questioned witnesses before.

06:34.604 --> 06:37.190
- With the stakes this high...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.025
- It could backfire.
- I know her.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.818
And she knows that I know her.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.446
So I have a better chance
of getting to her than you do.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.948
- Celeste...
- It's my turn, Katie.

06:46.032 --> 06:47.158
It's my turn.

06:51.788 --> 06:53.539
<i>It's a very smart play on her part.</i>

06:53.623 --> 06:56.125
Because she might be up there
in her capacity as a lawyer,

06:56.209 --> 06:59.003
but she'll be presenting herself again
as a person, as a mother.

06:59.087 --> 07:01.714
And this time without being subject
to cross-examination.

07:01.798 --> 07:04.675
And all the questions she's asking you,

07:04.759 --> 07:06.886
what she'll really be doing
is showing the judge:

07:06.969 --> 07:11.682
"Look at how stable I am,
look at how reasonable, how smart."

07:11.766 --> 07:15.186
I even expect her to go gently,
you know?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.230
Putting her compassion on full display.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.524
- If you see her doing that...
- Sleeping Beauty.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.567
That's how Perry would describe her
to me.

07:21.651 --> 07:23.027
Sleeping Beauty.

07:25.363 --> 07:26.364
He was her prince.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.700
- And she killed him.
- Mary Louise...

07:32.954 --> 07:34.914
only answer the questions
that are asked.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.169
Oh, uh, yeah.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.879
No problem.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.297
Okay. Let's go.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.603
And she kept repeating...

08:00.648 --> 08:02.441
over and over again.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.110
Look what you made me do.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.408
Look what you made me do!

08:12.076 --> 08:13.244
All rise.

08:17.874 --> 08:23.588
Case number CV-04111,
the matter of Joshua and Maxwell Wright.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.214
This court is now in session,

08:25.298 --> 08:27.884
the Honorable Judge Marylin Cipriani
presiding.

08:27.967 --> 08:28.967
Be seated.

08:31.596 --> 08:34.599
Mrs. Wright, please take the stand.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.682
Mrs. Wright?

08:47.737 --> 08:49.864
Please raise your right hand.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.033
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

08:52.116 --> 08:54.160
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

08:54.243 --> 08:55.661
- I do.
- Be seated.

08:57.914 --> 08:59.498
Okay. You're up.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.216
Mary Louise.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.218
Celeste.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.139
Your attorney made me out
to be quite the bad mother.

09:15.223 --> 09:17.850
He was just asking questions.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.101
You answered them.

09:19.185 --> 09:22.396
Is it your observation
that I am a bad mother?

09:23.814 --> 09:24.814
As I...

09:25.733 --> 09:28.611
As you heard me tell Judge Cipriani
when we were in chambers,

09:28.694 --> 09:32.240
I consider you
to be a wonderfully committed parent.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.493
That's not the impression...

09:35.576 --> 09:37.954
As to my observations, yes.

09:38.037 --> 09:42.083
I have observed you
being violent with the boys.

09:42.166 --> 09:47.171
I witnessed you throwing Max to the ground
and shaking him.

09:47.255 --> 09:50.716
I saw you drive off,
wearing nothing but your jammies,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.970
under the influence of who-knows-what.

09:54.053 --> 09:55.471
You say Ambien.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
And you crashed the car, in fact.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.518
So you're not okay.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.688
That's my observation.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.773
Which we can all accept,

10:05.856 --> 10:07.984
after all you have been through.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.698
But I cannot accept
these children being placed

10:13.781 --> 10:16.033
in such imminent peril.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.453
Did you ever report to Child Services

10:19.537 --> 10:21.831
that you believed
my children to be in danger?

10:22.915 --> 10:23.958
I probably should have.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.376
So the answer is no.

10:26.419 --> 10:28.421
Yeah, it's no.

10:28.504 --> 10:32.425
Did you ever report to any other agency
that you believed

10:32.508 --> 10:35.219
my boys to be in imminent peril?

10:37.430 --> 10:38.431
No.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.851
You suggested
that I got violent with my sons.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.062
Is it your testimony
that I am routinely violent with them?

10:45.146 --> 10:48.274
- No. Not routinely, but...
- Is it your testimony

10:48.357 --> 10:50.985
that I am often violent with them?

10:52.987 --> 10:54.071
No.

10:54.155 --> 10:57.325
But who knows what I haven't seen?

10:57.408 --> 11:00.828
So now you're basing your opinions
on what you haven't seen?

11:01.871 --> 11:04.749
I'm not a trained lawyer,
so the semantics...

11:04.832 --> 11:07.251
Please, would you direct your responses
to me?

11:07.335 --> 11:08.753
I'm asking the questions.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.548
Okay.

11:13.299 --> 11:19.972
Now, the truth of it is, you saw me
lose my temper with my son once.

11:20.056 --> 11:24.060
Where I overreacted,
I pushed him to the ground once.

11:24.143 --> 11:25.144
All it takes is once.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.189
Well, you would know that
better than anyone, wouldn't you?

11:28.272 --> 11:29.899
As a young mother,

11:29.982 --> 11:33.152
did you ever lose your temper
with your boys?

11:33.235 --> 11:35.571
Well, this isn't simply about temper
or temperament...

11:35.654 --> 11:39.075
Did you ever lose your temper
while you were driving an automobile

11:39.158 --> 11:41.077
and cause the car to crash?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.874
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

11:48.793 --> 11:50.378
No, I heard the question.

11:50.461 --> 11:51.629
It was obscene.

11:53.422 --> 11:57.927
Your son Raymond died, in part,
because you lost your temper.

11:58.010 --> 11:58.928
Isn't that true?

11:59.011 --> 12:00.179
Objection.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.973
This witness has testified
that I put my sons in peril.

12:03.057 --> 12:04.517
It is relevant to this proceeding

12:04.600 --> 12:08.562
as to whether or not
she has ever killed a child in her care.

12:08.646 --> 12:10.606
Mrs. Wright, please sit.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.732
Please.

12:20.116 --> 12:22.159
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

12:22.243 --> 12:25.663
I am simply trying
to protect my children.

12:25.746 --> 12:30.793
Now, the idea of you driving with my
children in the backseat of your car

12:30.876 --> 12:33.921
while you lose your temper,
that is terrifying to me.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.715
Your Honor, this is indecent.

12:36.799 --> 12:41.804
Are you suggesting this cross-examination
should be limited to decency, Mr. Farber?

12:41.887 --> 12:44.140
Mrs. Wright, you don't get to go at him.

12:44.223 --> 12:48.644
Indecent or not,
this case is about mothering,

12:48.727 --> 12:51.021
which puts your parenting strategies
in issue.

12:52.314 --> 12:57.987
Now, I cannot imagine the trauma of
losing your child in an automobile crash.

12:58.070 --> 13:02.658
It must have been unspeakably devastating
for both you and for Perry.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.743
It was.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.580
How old was Perry at the time?

13:07.663 --> 13:10.416
Oh, he was 5.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.251
He was 5.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.086
- Five years old.
- Mm-hm.

13:16.213 --> 13:20.926
To witness his brother die,
his only brother.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.388
Did you put him into therapy?

13:24.472 --> 13:26.098
To deal with the trauma?

13:26.182 --> 13:31.020
In those days, we were less inclined
to outsource our children's pain.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.481
So you assumed that role, did you?

13:33.564 --> 13:34.940
Attending to Perry's trauma?

13:35.024 --> 13:36.525
Yes, I did.

13:36.609 --> 13:39.069
And you talked to him?
You consoled him?

13:39.153 --> 13:40.153
Yes.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.071
Held him?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.327
All of the above. Yes.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.037
Mm-hm.

13:49.330 --> 13:50.330
Blamed him?

13:52.208 --> 13:55.836
Did you ever blame him
for causing the car to crash?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.631
I most certainly did not.

13:58.714 --> 14:02.343
Did you ever accuse him
of distracting you?

14:02.426 --> 14:06.138
Did you ever say to him,
"Look what you made me do"?

14:06.222 --> 14:07.222
No.

14:08.224 --> 14:10.684
No? So if Perry were to have told me
that you blamed him

14:10.768 --> 14:12.895
- for his brother's death...
- Objection, hearsay.

14:12.978 --> 14:13.896
Overruled.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.232
If Perry were to have told me
that you punished him,

14:16.315 --> 14:18.734
that you even emotionally battered him...

14:18.817 --> 14:21.070
I never, ever battered him.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.781
If he told me that you said to him:

14:23.864 --> 14:25.115
"This is your fault.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.869
It is your fault
that your brother was killed."

14:28.953 --> 14:30.579
- Stop it.
- Did you ever...?

14:30.663 --> 14:32.373
- No, stop it.
- Objection, Your Honor.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.583
- Did you ever, ever hit him?
- No.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.210
- Did you ever kick Perry?
- I never...

14:36.293 --> 14:38.254
- Mrs. Wright.
- It's a lie. It's a lie.

14:38.337 --> 14:42.049
Mrs. Wright, we do seem to be drifting
beyond the scope of the inquiry here.

14:42.132 --> 14:46.345
My husband physically and emotionally
abused me.

14:46.428 --> 14:49.431
Your Honor well knows
that abusers don't just happen.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.101
They are more than likely
to be victims of abuse themselves.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.687
Whether or not this witness is an abuser

14:54.770 --> 14:57.982
is certainly, certainly not
beyond the scope of this inquiry.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.065
You're a liar.

15:00.150 --> 15:04.738
And the fact that violence
may have been a part

15:04.822 --> 15:08.909
of your sexual relationship...

15:08.993 --> 15:10.911
He was not an abuser.

15:10.995 --> 15:12.329
Not for one second.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.290
And is Jane Chapman a liar?

15:16.166 --> 15:23.166
Is this woman sitting here lying
when she says that your son raped her?

15:23.257 --> 15:25.718
- She's mistaken.
- She is "mistaken."

15:25.801 --> 15:28.220
Is that something
a woman is likely to get wrong?

15:28.304 --> 15:30.472
Whether or not she's being raped?

15:30.556 --> 15:32.808
Well, he perhaps got too vi...

15:32.891 --> 15:34.560
Physical with her...

15:36.270 --> 15:39.273
as a result of thinking
that women sometimes like that,

15:39.356 --> 15:42.318
the way you enjoyed it.

15:42.401 --> 15:46.155
And now you're trying
to cover over your sickness

15:46.238 --> 15:48.657
with these disgusting fabrications.

15:49.742 --> 15:53.912
Max and Josh need to believe
in their dad.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.165
How do they get to do that
with you walking around

15:56.248 --> 16:00.461
calling him a rapist and an abuser?

16:00.544 --> 16:03.213
The way you assassinate him,
his memory.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.923
He's not here.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.176
He's not here to defend himself.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.552
He's the victim here.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.638
- Oh, my God.
- Not you.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.898
<i>I can't, Perry. You're hurting my arm.</i>

16:20.981 --> 16:22.566
<i>You don't wanna do this, okay?</i>

16:22.650 --> 16:24.193
<i>I'm talking to you!</i>

16:24.276 --> 16:25.276
<i>Get off!</i>

16:25.319 --> 16:26.695
<i>You little shit.</i>

16:26.779 --> 16:28.197
<i>Will you stop?</i>

16:30.324 --> 16:31.325
<i>Fuck you!</i>

16:31.408 --> 16:32.826
<i>Oh, my...</i>

16:32.910 --> 16:34.745
<i>Are you gonna ask more questions?</i>

16:36.997 --> 16:37.997
<i>Come on.</i>

16:39.083 --> 16:40.250
<i>Get up, get up.</i>

16:42.795 --> 16:44.713
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.548
<i>- Please.
- You're bleeding.</i>

16:48.092 --> 16:50.427
<i>- No!</i>
- Okay. Okay.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.270
My sons took that video.

17:01.313 --> 17:05.901
Your concerns that I am making up stories
about their father are unfounded.

17:08.404 --> 17:10.364
Mary Louise, look at me.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.492
This was your son.

17:17.204 --> 17:21.541
You were so incredible.
I'm just sorry that...

17:22.835 --> 17:24.752
I didn't know he was doing that to you.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.590
That he was hurting you like that.

17:29.675 --> 17:31.051
It's because I didn't tell you.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.929
No, I should've known, Celeste.
I'm your best friend.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.306
I should have felt something.

17:38.684 --> 17:42.062
- You're gonna win, right?
- No, not necessarily.

17:42.146 --> 17:44.648
That just spoke to Perry's evil,
but it didn't...

17:44.732 --> 17:47.735
It didn't go so much
to my fitness as a mother.

17:49.528 --> 17:52.448
I mean, how could I let them live
in that house?

17:54.116 --> 17:57.202
How could I let them see those things?

17:57.286 --> 18:00.247
And they saw so much more
than I ever knew.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.627
Maybe I'm not a good mother.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.671
Maybe I'm not fit.

18:07.755 --> 18:10.841
Don't ever say that.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.301
Don't even think that.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.764
You are an incredible mother.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.807
Are you perfect?

18:18.891 --> 18:21.393
No. Am I perfect? No.

18:21.477 --> 18:22.853
There's no such thing.

18:24.438 --> 18:28.525
But you...
Celeste, look how far you've come.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.736
And look at how strong you are.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.321
You can't falter here.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.072
Do you hear me?

18:34.156 --> 18:35.866
Those boys belong with you.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.869
Okay?

18:46.627 --> 18:47.627
How's it going?

18:49.338 --> 18:50.338
Not great.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.886
I'm sorry.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.767
I don't want you to think
that I don't like you.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.562
It's not fair to put all this on you.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.023
You know, you should be out there
having fun,

19:08.106 --> 19:10.234
not dealing with me.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.485
What is fun?

19:12.528 --> 19:15.197
Is that getting drunk
and going to some bar,

19:15.280 --> 19:17.741
ending up with a girl
I have no connection to?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.205
This is fun.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.916
Okay, first, nothing is perfect.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.336
Nothing's even best.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.713
But if you can find better, nice...

19:32.756 --> 19:34.091
Even good is good.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.678
Secondly,
no matter how good something is,

19:37.761 --> 19:39.596
you can ruin it by overthinking it.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.642
Just your two cents.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.071
- What?
- Kill it.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.489
Ten more minutes.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.117
- Stop it.
- And then all the killing stops.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.327
- I got it, I got it.
- Okay, there you go.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.079
- Hey.
- Come on.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.581
Did court go good?

20:05.664 --> 20:07.291
Yeah. I think it did.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.667
Were you a superhero?

20:10.919 --> 20:14.256
Oh, I was like Wonder Woman
and the Incredible Hulk.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.382
Combined.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.717
Did you beat her up?

20:16.800 --> 20:17.968
What?

20:18.051 --> 20:19.428
No.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.263
Nobody beat anybody up.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.520
Oh, my God...

20:32.065 --> 20:34.109
- Why did you lie?
- I didn't lie.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.862
You said that I hit him, that I kicked him.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.989
Perry told me what you did.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.867
- That never happened.
- So you're saying Perry's a liar?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.706
No, I... I brought him up to be good.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.833
A good boy. A good man.

20:49.917 --> 20:56.048
That person that we saw on the videotape,
I don't know who that is...

20:56.131 --> 20:59.968
I hope that you don't live
to bury your children, Celeste,

21:00.052 --> 21:03.347
because you would not even
be standing.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.183
You lost your boys.
You don't get to take mine.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.685
But... Don't...

21:08.769 --> 21:09.937
Don't lie.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.521
Don't lie about me.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.899
Don't lie about me. It's not fair.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.067
It's not fair.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.496
My turn, Dad.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.332
You can go.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.335
You go.

21:35.128 --> 21:38.173
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay by myself.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.634
I've been really enjoying this time
with her, you know?

21:40.717 --> 21:43.220
She's, um... She's a good listener now.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.265
Okay.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.487
Bye.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.360
So you wanna go, huh?

22:47.701 --> 22:49.494
I forgot to tell you something.

22:50.871 --> 22:53.206
Or maybe I said it.
I don't remember, but...

22:56.460 --> 22:58.253
it looks like now's the time.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.596
I love you, Momma.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.809
It took me my whole life to say that.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.557
I've been thinking a lot
about something you said a while back.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.435
About the lie.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.688
And that it was...

24:01.608 --> 24:03.068
It had a shelf life.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.363
I think you're right.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.283
And I've been feeling really, really bad
that I started it.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.370
- You didn't start it...
- Yes, I did.

24:13.453 --> 24:17.624
And you didn't have to follow suit,
but you did, but I started it.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.707
And...

24:19.835 --> 24:22.879
I can just see the damage that it's done,
and it's eroding all of us.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.464
Every single one of us.

24:24.548 --> 24:25.632
Including me.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.844
It's unraveling all of our friendships.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.346
Madeline, you and I have a friendship,
and Jane.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.848
That... That's...

24:34.766 --> 24:38.061
the Monterey Five,
whatever we call ourselves...

24:38.145 --> 24:40.438
The lie is the friendship.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.335
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Momma.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.588
Hi, Grandma.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.217
My God.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.762
What's happened?

25:12.846 --> 25:14.931
She woke up saying she was hungry.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.978
Are you hungry, baby?

25:21.146 --> 25:23.231
Will you run out and
get a bottle of wine?

25:25.901 --> 25:28.236
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thank you.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.958
<i>Do we really have to wear ties?</i>

25:42.042 --> 25:43.501
Yes.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.295
I think it's a good idea.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.965
You're so handsome.

25:50.425 --> 25:53.762
Your daddy always looked so good in ties.

25:53.845 --> 25:57.515
If he was here,
he wouldn't let Grandma do this.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.683
No.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.562
Now, I don't think it's likely,

26:02.646 --> 26:07.025
but if the judge asks you any questions,
you just answer honestly and you be polite,

26:07.108 --> 26:10.111
- all right?
- Tell her that we wanna stay with you?

26:10.195 --> 26:12.739
Yeah. If that's what you want.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.824
Yeah. You tell her that.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.618
Are you scared?

26:16.701 --> 26:17.744
A little bit.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.080
Are you?

26:21.122 --> 26:23.333
Mm. Kind of, yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.585
- Mm-hm.
- Me too.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.050
We're in it together, okay?

26:41.101 --> 26:43.436
Hey. What'd I say about sugar?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.230
What doesn't kill you...?

26:45.313 --> 26:48.275
No. Where did you even get that stuff?

26:48.358 --> 26:49.651
I have connections.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.948
Uh, you should pack up your things, though.
We have to go.

26:59.744 --> 27:03.498
So is that me?

27:03.581 --> 27:05.542
That punching bag?

27:05.625 --> 27:06.835
It's not you.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.338
I need to know what you're thinking.

27:10.422 --> 27:15.093
I honestly don't know
if we are apart or together,

27:15.176 --> 27:18.680
or getting better, or we're getting worse.

27:18.763 --> 27:22.392
I just need to know what's in your head
before my own fucking head explodes.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.314
Okay, come on.

27:30.942 --> 27:31.942
Sit down.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.617
Chloe, please.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.082
You know, I've been thinking
about our wedding day.

27:48.418 --> 27:52.547
Maybe because you were, like,
prancing around in your veil.

27:52.630 --> 27:55.508
- Do you remember that day, Madeline?
- Yeah.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.471
I remember it was really joyous.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.930
Yeah, it was joyous for me too.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.190
But delusional.

28:10.273 --> 28:13.568
I mean, we did not know
what we were getting into.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.739
I mean, you were married before,
maybe you had a better idea,

28:17.822 --> 28:23.036
but most weddings
are just like this blind leap of faith.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.205
All the vows we take, I mean,

28:26.247 --> 28:28.917
we can't even know
what the fuck that means.

28:30.335 --> 28:34.422
- I really don't like where this is going.
- Look, you are not who you were then.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.260
And neither am I. People change.

28:46.184 --> 28:48.269
We need to renew our vows.

28:50.230 --> 28:51.231
What?

28:51.314 --> 28:54.192
This time, committing to live up to them.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.320
- Do you think you can do that?
- With all my heart.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.989
Fully informed
as to what we're getting into.

29:00.073 --> 29:04.285
Truly, truly, yes.
Committing to better or worse...

29:04.369 --> 29:06.704
No, no. Your worst is off the table.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.705
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.207
- Got it. Absolutely.
- All right.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.667
Do you really mean it?

29:11.751 --> 29:12.751
Look...

29:14.879 --> 29:17.424
This is not some, like:

29:17.507 --> 29:21.302
"Put a tidy ribbon on it,
bygones be bygones" ending.

29:22.846 --> 29:26.433
Okay? This is a shot at a new beginning.

29:26.516 --> 29:30.645
Which, like, if you really feel
that you're up to it...

29:30.728 --> 29:33.148
I am. I am.

29:34.566 --> 29:35.733
Well, then so am I.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.077
- I love you.
- I love you too.

29:48.872 --> 29:51.082
- This is gonna be really good.
- Yeah.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.168
Oh, my God. We can do it on the beach.

29:53.251 --> 29:55.211
We can have a tent, and a big party,

29:55.295 --> 29:58.256
- and then we can do like a seafood...
- No, no, no. No party.

29:58.339 --> 30:01.718
Just you, me, Abigail, Chloe.

30:01.801 --> 30:02.844
Family.

30:04.762 --> 30:06.014
That sounds perfect.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.057
Okay.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.618
It's gonna be okay.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.659
- What's going on?
- There's been a setback.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.370
- What kind of setback?
- Another stroke, most likely.

31:10.453 --> 31:13.915
We're taking her into radiology now
to see what we're dealing with.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.041
Momma...

31:16.042 --> 31:17.502
Momma...

31:17.585 --> 31:21.130
- Has she been sedated?
- No, she's just unconscious.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.007
- Jesus.
- Will she wake up?

31:23.091 --> 31:25.760
We have to look at the pictures
to know what's going on.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.971
She's too young.
This doesn't make any sense.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.722
We'll get her back as soon as we can.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.017
All rise.

31:35.270 --> 31:41.025
Case number CV-04111,
the matter of Joshua and Maxwell Wright.

31:41.109 --> 31:42.735
This court is now in session,

31:42.819 --> 31:45.321
the Honorable Judge Marylin Cipriani
presiding.

31:45.405 --> 31:46.698
Be seated.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.747
This is a difficult decision,

31:54.831 --> 32:01.087
one made more so by the cumulative wash
of the child psychiatrists' reports.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.797
These reports, which conclude...

32:02.880 --> 32:05.049
If I may be heard, Your Honor.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.133
All right.

32:08.595 --> 32:12.557
What I saw on that video...

32:17.353 --> 32:19.772
I simply had no idea.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.775
I'm so sorry. I...

32:24.110 --> 32:27.739
I don't know what to say
to make you forgive me.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.284
I had no idea.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.872
If I had...

32:35.955 --> 32:37.123
But...

32:39.250 --> 32:44.213
this is not about forgiveness or blame.

32:44.297 --> 32:48.509
This, today, is about the well-being
of these two splendid young men,

32:50.678 --> 32:52.555
Josh and Max.

32:52.639 --> 32:57.685
Your Honor, I told you from the outset,
I bear no contempt for my daughter-in-law.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.395
In fact, I... I love her.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.065
How could I not?

33:02.148 --> 33:05.943
She made my son so happy.
And the boys.

33:08.321 --> 33:11.115
But, Celeste, you are ill.

33:12.408 --> 33:17.914
What we saw on that video
was repugnant.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.957
It was grotesque.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.751
I'm so ashamed of my son.

33:22.835 --> 33:27.048
But you were a part of it.

33:27.131 --> 33:28.508
You were complicit in it.

33:28.591 --> 33:32.929
You have admitted to me,
to yourself, to this court,

33:33.012 --> 33:37.475
that you were a part of this sickness
that you exposed your children to,

33:37.558 --> 33:39.644
that they may have been infected by,

33:39.727 --> 33:43.898
that they recorded on their smartphone
to stick in their memory book.

33:43.981 --> 33:47.443
It's a sickness that,
given your most recent...

33:48.695 --> 33:51.406
social adventures with strangers,

33:51.489 --> 33:56.077
it seems that you are unable to resist.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.787
So...

33:57.870 --> 34:02.458
Your Honor, I have no doubt
that she will get herself well.

34:02.542 --> 34:08.797
But in the meantime, right now,
we just need to safeguard the boys.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.138
She wants what's best
for her grandchildren,

34:15.221 --> 34:19.434
as she did for her son, Perry.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.270
That man that you saw on that tape,

34:23.396 --> 34:27.817
that was because of your parenting,
your caregiving.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.945
It's one thing to be asked
to turn your children over.

34:31.027 --> 34:34.574
It's quite another
to be asked to give them to you.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.454
These are my babies.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.913
I am their mother.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.208
And I have protected them
against the most formidable of odds.

34:44.292 --> 34:46.710
I kept them alive. I kept myself alive.

34:48.588 --> 34:52.049
And on this, I agree with you,
Mary Louise, you had no...

34:53.092 --> 34:54.135
No idea.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.597
And that is the problem.

35:00.016 --> 35:01.601
My sons are...

35:01.684 --> 35:03.311
They're good boys.

35:06.606 --> 35:09.150
And I will raise them to be good men.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.610
They will be good men.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.786
I have a list of conditions
and compliances,

35:19.869 --> 35:22.413
which will be entered
together with my judgment.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.541
They are self-evident
and they are to be followed.

35:25.625 --> 35:30.171
As for the judgment itself,
as it's been noted by all,

35:30.254 --> 35:33.925
these boys have been through
an unimaginable ordeal.

35:34.008 --> 35:38.805
They face great challenges ahead with
their healing, their development.

35:38.888 --> 35:39.972
It won't be easy.

35:41.849 --> 35:45.061
I'm not going to make it any harder
by taking them away from their mother.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.855
The petition to appoint guardianship
is denied.

35:47.939 --> 35:50.149
Full custody shall reside
with Celeste Wright.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.943
- We're adjourned.
- Oh, my God.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.824
I'm sorry.

36:23.099 --> 36:25.184
I need you to do something for me.

37:16.027 --> 37:18.195
- Here.
- Thanks.

37:23.034 --> 37:24.535
I'm so sorry, honey.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.334
Nathan.

37:35.755 --> 37:36.797
You're a good man

37:38.299 --> 37:40.217
and a wonderful father.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.720
Skye adores you, and she should.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.099
And I know you love me.

37:49.518 --> 37:52.813
But you've been right to think
that something's been going on with me.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.399
So I'm gonna be truthful.

37:57.526 --> 37:59.654
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you this sooner.

38:08.037 --> 38:09.622
I'm not in love with you.

38:10.957 --> 38:13.376
I know this isn't the best
time to tell you, but I...

38:14.543 --> 38:15.962
I don't think I've ever been.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.219
I just can't lie anymore.

38:27.223 --> 38:28.223
I'm sorry.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.887
What the fuck is this?

39:08.139 --> 39:09.139
Well, hi.

39:10.307 --> 39:11.600
Why is this still here?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.688
Funny you should ask.

39:15.771 --> 39:19.483
I sold it all today to Ted Farrell.

39:19.567 --> 39:22.820
The guy gave me a check for 410
for the whole kit and caboodle.

39:22.903 --> 39:26.991
- Nice. Well, Celeste...
- And the best part is, we get to keep it all.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.203
What do you mean,
we get to keep it all?

39:31.287 --> 39:34.123
Ted's just a collector,
only cares whether it appreciates or not.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.835
And he knows there's no better steward
for it than me, so we get to keep it all.

39:37.918 --> 39:41.505
So basically, you're saying
you get to keep your toys?

39:41.589 --> 39:43.966
Ah. Perfect, huh?

39:46.052 --> 39:47.052
No.

39:48.846 --> 39:50.931
No, it's not perfect.

39:51.015 --> 39:53.893
- It's far from fucking perfect.
- Oh, God.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.605
- All my stuff is gone.
- Look. Come on. Please.

39:57.688 --> 40:00.775
We got money for this, all right?
Calm the fuck down.

40:00.858 --> 40:03.402
- Calm down?
- Yes, calm down, all right?

40:04.653 --> 40:07.156
You lost all our money.

40:07.239 --> 40:12.078
- Oh, my God, here we go.
- You have plunged us into bankruptcy.

40:12.161 --> 40:15.206
- Yeah.
- We are selling our home.

40:15.289 --> 40:17.374
Our daughter's home.

40:17.458 --> 40:21.420
And all the while,
you've been fucking the nanny?

40:21.504 --> 40:24.673
Well, now she's gone,
I need something to play with, don't I?

40:28.010 --> 40:29.428
Oh, my God.

40:34.809 --> 40:37.228
That was too much. I'm so... Hey!

40:37.311 --> 40:40.064
What the fuck are you doing?
We don't own any of this!

40:40.147 --> 40:41.190
Goddamn it!

40:41.273 --> 40:44.110
- Renata! Fucking hell!
- Fuck you!

40:44.193 --> 40:46.028
- Come on now... No.
- Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck!

40:46.112 --> 40:47.238
Fuck it!

40:47.321 --> 40:50.533
- Not that. No, come on, don't...
- Is that your favorite fucking baby?

40:50.616 --> 40:51.867
No! Hey, hey.

40:53.536 --> 40:54.537
No!

41:02.253 --> 41:03.420
Oh, my God.

41:05.131 --> 41:08.801
Maybe you should've shown a woman
a little respect!

41:13.722 --> 41:14.722
I'm done.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.686
No more bullshit.

41:20.813 --> 41:22.148
No more lies.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.379
Do you, Ed,
take Madeline to be your wife?

41:45.462 --> 41:49.049
To love her, comfort her,
honor and protect her,

41:49.133 --> 41:51.302
as long as you both shall live?

41:51.385 --> 41:52.385
I do.

41:53.971 --> 41:57.474
Do you, Mom, take Ed
to be your husband,

41:57.558 --> 42:01.562
to love and comfort him,
honor and protect him,

42:01.645 --> 42:04.148
as long as you both shall live?

42:04.231 --> 42:05.231
I do.

42:06.275 --> 42:09.528
Okay, I therefore proclaim
that you are husband and wife.

42:09.612 --> 42:11.280
You may now kiss the bride.
