A NETFLIX SERIES

00:29.279 --> 00:30.864
- Hello?
- Micha!

00:32.449 --> 00:33.616
How's everything going?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.493
"How's everything going?"

00:36.661 --> 00:37.662
<i>How have you been?</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:41.458
Fine.

00:41.958 --> 00:42.792
I'm fine.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.506
<i>Is something wrong? Why are you calling?</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:53.470
Micha,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.056
I'd like to see you.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.557
You know?

00:57.640 --> 00:58.558
Talk to you.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.101
<i>Lots of things have happened.</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:02.520
<i>Anyway, when are you free?</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:06.107
I'm leaving on a trip tomorrow.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.067
<i>Really?</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.278
<i>Where, with whom?</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:11.988
To France, with Mom and Grandma.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.408
<i>Then, I'm taking a class
with some friends in Milan.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:16.451
For how long?

01:16.951 --> 01:18.369
<i>I'll be back in March.</i>

01:18.453 --> 01:19.496
March?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.752
Can I see you before you leave?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.798
You can't wait four months?

01:40.642 --> 01:43.686
- See you when you get back, Micha.
<i>-Yes, of course.</i>

01:43.770 --> 01:44.854
Have a nice trip.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.236
<i>That bastard held
a press conference without me.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:57.695
<i>And he talks about</i> Songbook

03:57.779 --> 04:00.365
<i>like some stopover
until he gets more clients--</i>

04:00.448 --> 04:02.575
Micky, there must be a way

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
to cut ties with Patricio.

04:04.118 --> 04:07.455
His dad is one of the most
important lawyers in Mexico.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.084
The most we could hope for
is getting him to pay a fine.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.544
And fucking ban him
from practice for life.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.838
<i>He just partnered with Foster.</i>

04:15.922 --> 04:19.175
He'll just use him
to find clients to manage.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.177
I've been here five years.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.639
Five years busting my ass,
five years of blood, sweat and tears.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.017
I turned down that movie,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.102
the duet.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.853
<i>I have to finish this album.</i>

04:30.937 --> 04:34.482
<i>Once it's out, I'll figure out what to do
with that rat piece of shit.</i>

04:34.565 --> 04:37.443
That's the plan, then,
and don't be so dramatic, okay?

04:38.027 --> 04:39.195
I know.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.154
Hugs!

04:51.207 --> 04:52.750
What's the dinner party about?

04:53.501 --> 04:54.544
I don't know, Alex.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.171
I think they start filming
this week or something.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.842
Do you know if I'm in the show?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.095
Oh, Pichita,

05:05.096 --> 05:06.264
I don't think so.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.394
- Come on, man!
- I really tried.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.565
I asked the producers and everything.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.817
They say your character

05:17.900 --> 05:19.152
wasn't important enough.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.612
You're hilarious.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.869
What about Mom?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.122
Do you know who's playing her?

05:34.375 --> 05:38.046
Micky, show me the picture,
I'm sure you have it on your phone.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.300
Here it is, Pichita.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.148
Holy shit!

06:00.985 --> 06:02.361
She does look like her.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.238
Yeah.

06:04.989 --> 06:05.948
A lot, right?

06:10.244 --> 06:11.204
She was so pretty.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.378
Well, Micky, I've got to get going.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.423
I'll call you later to hear more.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.300
Take care, Pichita.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.655
Come in.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.741
- How are you, Humberto?
- Hi.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.742
Azucena.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.160
Come in, please.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.037
Sit down.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.249
When do we start recording?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.625
Next week, right?

06:57.708 --> 06:59.919
I reckon it'll be ready

07:00.002 --> 07:01.671
in three or four months.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.215
I'd like to plan my next tour.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.223
What?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.726
We're having trouble getting contracts.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.815
Here, in Las Vegas, where?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.317
Everywhere, Micky.

07:23.401 --> 07:27.488
The stakeholders
are afraid we'll cancel or--

07:28.364 --> 07:29.198
Or what?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.118
What?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.454
Or that we won't sell out.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.882
When have I ever not sold out
the National Auditorium?

07:46.465 --> 07:47.592
That's what I said.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.682
We must find money somewhere.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.893
We're too deep in debt.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.981
Talk to the judge, ask for an extension.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.154
Humberto,

08:09.363 --> 08:10.615
please, do as I say.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.328
Fine.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.580
I promise I'll try.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.117
<i>All right, Micky!</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:01.535
<i>One more time, please.</i>

11:26.519 --> 11:27.520
Ready?

11:27.603 --> 11:28.729
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.363
Oh, one more thing.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.616
I know you don't like surprises,
so listen.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.786
I think they're going to introduce you

11:43.869 --> 11:46.080
to the actor who'll portray you.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.748
Really? You don't say.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.029
There he is.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.993
Hi. How are you?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.292
Luis Miguel, how are you?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.669
- How are you?
- Hello, Micky.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.713
Nice to meet you.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.048
I'm Diego Boneta.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.094
Yes, of course, nice to meet you.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.516
Yes, a photo!

12:50.227 --> 12:51.228
Come here.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.231
One, two, three!

13:57.711 --> 13:59.755
Of course, Luis Miguel.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.174
It's a pleasure having you here.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.412
<i>You should've heard it.</i>

15:18.167 --> 15:19.001
It moved me.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.214
You know? I've never...

15:26.425 --> 15:29.720
heard you talk about <i>Songbook</i>
the way you're talking about mariachi.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.306
Never.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.645
Stop wasting your time.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.773
You should focus on what you really love.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.536
I have an idea.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.457
An idea?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.042
To get out of this.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.462
Damn, you're scaring me!

16:18.644 --> 16:19.478
Man!

16:20.270 --> 16:23.107
- Bro, how are you?
- Great.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.525
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.609
You look good.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.194
Hey,

16:28.028 --> 16:29.363
any news about that thing?

16:29.988 --> 16:31.031
Yes.

16:31.115 --> 16:31.991
Tell me.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.869
I spoke with the people at Caesars.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.708
And your office told you the truth.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.002
They know you've canceled shows

16:44.086 --> 16:45.754
and they're worried.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.384
- They don't want me to sing at Caesars?
- Of course they do.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.886
They do, as long as...

16:54.888 --> 16:56.807
we pay rent for the venue.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.559
In advance.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.352
Are you serious?

17:00.436 --> 17:01.437
One hundred percent.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.362
I'll pay it.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.031
How much?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.283
Wait, Micky.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.243
It's risky.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.121
What if tickets don't sell--?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.080
Bro--

17:21.915 --> 17:22.875
It'll sell out.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.461
I believe in you.

17:26.754 --> 17:31.008
- But what if it doesn't?
- Just put them in contact with Azucena.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.010
Really?

17:33.552 --> 17:34.553
One hundred percent.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.151
Where's everyone else?

18:31.860 --> 18:33.612
I told them to come an hour later.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.447
I want to talk to you.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.242
Patricio,

18:39.701 --> 18:42.371
I need you to give me back
my share of Aries.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.086
I already explained it is legally mine.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.797
You signed the papers.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.675
I'm sorry.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.135
Fine.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.306
I just talked to Foster
and canceled <i>Songbook.</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:04.643
You canceled?

19:07.062 --> 19:07.896
Very well.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.109
You'll never record another song here.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.652
Yes.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.072
Just what David said,
and I'll tell you what I told him.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.408
I don't give a shit!

19:22.953 --> 19:23.787
Sure.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.749
You don't care about ruining
your career in the US or worldwide.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.044
No, what I care about is,
if I don't do <i>Songbook,</i>

19:31.128 --> 19:33.088
I don't have to work with you, bastard.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.883
So, give me back Aries

19:35.966 --> 19:37.509
or I'll lock you up.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.427
Bring it on.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.890
Good luck finding a lawyer
willing to go up against me.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.607
Anything else?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.278
Hello?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.447
Great, how are you?

19:59.489 --> 20:01.825
Yeah, he's here. I'll put him on.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.743
Here.

20:09.917 --> 20:10.751
Hello?

20:10.834 --> 20:14.379
<i>Patricio, I need you
to come to Mexico, right now!</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:16.381
To Mexico? What are you talking about?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.718
<i>I want you to take
the first flight available.</i>

20:20.510 --> 20:22.930
Dad, I don't know what he told you,

20:23.013 --> 20:25.557
but I promise everything's okay.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.558
<i>I'll be waiting,</i>

20:26.642 --> 20:28.602
<i>and not another word.</i>

20:31.146 --> 20:31.980
Yikes!

20:32.940 --> 20:34.107
In trouble with Daddy?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.738
You couldn't keep this between you and me?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.245
Give me back Aries.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.709
Or I'll make sure
every newspaper in Mexico

20:52.793 --> 20:55.212
knows that one
of the country's best lawyers

20:56.129 --> 20:58.674
is helping me put his own son in jail.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.718
You have no idea what you've done.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.139
Bringing my dad into this was a mistake.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.975
You're a pompous idiot!

21:11.603 --> 21:12.604
One last thing,

21:13.480 --> 21:15.774
Hugo López was my only manager.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.652
If you ever say you're my manager,

21:19.528 --> 21:20.404
I'll kill you.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.033
Go on. Daddy's waiting.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.221
MEXICO CITY, 2018

21:46.304 --> 21:49.474
No, it's not a budget issue.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.477
It's just that I don’t like it.
So, I'm not wearing it.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.940
Yeah, I get it, of course.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.192
True, but we didn't sign for...

22:03.071 --> 22:04.114
I'll call you later.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.784
How do you know where I live?

22:14.499 --> 22:15.333
Look.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.297
This is nice.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.509
Your series came out, right?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.263
So they tell me.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.602
So, do you like it?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.360
Micha.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.071
Please, sit down.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.837
Remember that time
I took you to the airport?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.551
You asked why
I hadn't seen you in 11 years.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.221
I said it was to protect you.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.598
But...

23:15.936 --> 23:17.813
actually, that wasn't true.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.152
It was to protect myself.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.202
I've been thinking a lot lately, Micha.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.831
I don't want to watch my series.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.666
<i>I can't</i> watch my series.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.672
If I do, I remember my mom,

23:43.755 --> 23:46.007
I remember Hugo,

23:47.843 --> 23:49.511
everyone who is no longer here.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.393
And when you've lost as much as I have...

24:05.569 --> 24:06.486
I'm afraid.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.490
I've always been afraid.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.200
Afraid of what?

24:18.540 --> 24:19.624
Afraid of loving you.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.217
I remember when you were little

24:29.301 --> 24:31.845
and Hugo died,
we went to the funeral at his house.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.433
I went up to him.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.685
And I told him-- No,

24:39.769 --> 24:40.687
I promised him...

24:44.774 --> 24:46.193
I'd always take care of you.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.782
That I'd be the dad
he never got the chance to be.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.875
I know I didn't keep that promise.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.389
I can't.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.601
I can't do this.

25:24.022 --> 25:24.856
But anyway...

25:30.570 --> 25:31.905
I'm recording a new album.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.701
And I have a big show at Caesars Palace,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.328
I'd love it if you were there.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.045
No.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.469
Of course not.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.029
It may not be the answer
you were expecting, but--

26:13.113 --> 26:14.990
No, I understand.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.576
It's fine. I--

26:19.077 --> 26:22.080
I wanted to see you, talk to you and--

26:25.250 --> 26:26.167
I have to go.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.254
I hope to see you soon.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.427
Take care, Micha.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.769
MEXICO CITY, 2000

26:45.270 --> 26:47.439
Well, I'm here now.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.817
Happy?

26:50.900 --> 26:54.362
My son stole
millions of dollars from his client.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.198
- Do you think I'm happy?
- You're assuming I'm guilty.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.410
Aren't we innocent until proven guilty?

27:00.493 --> 27:03.997
What part of this problem
are you not getting?

27:04.998 --> 27:07.459
That's 20 years in prison, 20 years!

27:07.542 --> 27:09.169
If you're lucky!

27:09.252 --> 27:12.255
Fortunately, the case
didn't reach Villegas or Rangel.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.507
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have gotten this deal.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.552
You'll give him back his share.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.095
He'll withdraw the lawsuit,

27:19.179 --> 27:20.639
and none of this gets out.

27:25.977 --> 27:26.811
No.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.359
- I'm not giving my company away.
- What's wrong with you, idiot?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.278
Your mom and the whole family
are suffering.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.614
I won't negotiate with you.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.909
You'll give him what he's asking for
and come work with me.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.077
Do you understand?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.333
Sign.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.133
Sign or I'll put you in jail myself.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.544
You're a disgrace
to this family, Patricio.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.696
The asshole fired everyone.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.574
It's the least of our worries.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.160
I can find people easily, okay?

29:05.243 --> 29:08.163
At least I have you two, right?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.375
Ambrosi,

29:12.876 --> 29:15.253
I want to move
all my financial team to the US.

29:15.336 --> 29:18.047
And I want to have the best lawyer there.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.049
Okay, I can handle that.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.343
And no press.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.344
Nothing.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.596
No press conferences?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.182
Not until I have new material,

29:27.265 --> 29:29.017
but my albums sell themselves.

29:29.934 --> 29:30.810
Okay.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.023
And Ambrosi,

29:36.858 --> 29:38.526
I want you in charge of my team.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.238
With Joe in charge of the tours.

29:42.864 --> 29:43.698
What?

29:43.782 --> 29:44.866
Excuse me?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.494
I mean, if you want.
If not, that's fine too.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.454
Tour manager.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.413
Tour manager!

29:50.497 --> 29:51.414
Manager!

29:54.709 --> 29:55.543
Thanks.

29:57.545 --> 29:58.588
Thank you.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.133
And Ambrosi,

30:04.010 --> 30:06.387
set me up a meeting with Mariachi Vargas.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.807
I have an idea for a song.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.185
Or maybe a whole album.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.111
Tour manager!

31:31.097 --> 31:33.474
<i>-Thanks for being with us, Micky.
- Thank you.</i>

31:33.558 --> 31:34.475
All right,

31:35.268 --> 31:37.687
we talked about Luis Miguel the child,

31:38.187 --> 31:40.148
about our memories of that Luis Miguel.

31:40.648 --> 31:44.694
<i>We talked about the Luis
we have here, a man, this guy.</i>

31:45.528 --> 31:46.571
What about at 50?

31:51.451 --> 31:52.702
Wow, at 50?

31:53.911 --> 31:55.163
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

31:55.246 --> 31:57.123
<i>I don't know what I'll be like at 50.</i>

31:58.082 --> 31:59.626
<i>I imagine I'll be</i>

32:01.085 --> 32:02.045
<i>fun.</i>

32:02.962 --> 32:04.297
<i>I'll have stories to tell.</i>

32:05.340 --> 32:07.926
<i>Yeah, I already have lots of stories.</i>

32:08.968 --> 32:10.011
<i>Imagine when I'm 50!</i>

32:10.094 --> 32:11.262
<i>I can imagine.</i>

32:13.932 --> 32:15.642
<i>I'll enjoy time with my grandkids.</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:17.226
And they'll be proud of you.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.270
- They will.
- Of course they will, Micky.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.689
Tell us about your tour.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.232
What cities are you visiting?

32:23.316 --> 32:24.817
Where will you be?

32:24.901 --> 32:26.402
We know Chile

32:26.486 --> 32:28.279
is waiting for you with open arms.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.880
Life flies by, kid.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.926
Wish me luck tomorrow, Huguito.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.030
<i>How is it out there?</i>

33:13.324 --> 33:14.450
<i>Is it full?</i>

33:17.537 --> 33:18.788
<i>What do you think, man?</i>`

34:20.558 --> 34:21.476
Thanks.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.773
Thank you very much!

34:29.192 --> 34:32.695
<i>You've no idea how happy I am
to be here with you tonight.</i>

34:33.279 --> 34:34.447
In Mexico!

34:37.992 --> 34:38.951
In my home.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.287
It has been so many years,

34:43.623 --> 34:45.333
so many songs.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.919
I mean it, thank you so much.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.467
I have a lovely surprise for you.

34:56.552 --> 34:57.553
I hope you like it.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.274
My mariachi!

37:39.924 --> 37:41.717
Let's see if you remember this one.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.613
THIS DRAMA WAS INSPIRED BY ACTUAL FACTS.

38:02.697 --> 38:06.242
HOWEVER, SOME DETAILS HAVE BEEN
FICTIONALIZED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.
