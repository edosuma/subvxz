necklace from Jill for a date,

00:10.271 --> 00:11.663

00:11.707 --> 00:13.404
Maybe you left it
at your date's house.

The date ended when
we left the Sizzler,

00:18.279 --> 00:19.541
You borrowed a fancy necklace

00:19.584 --> 00:21.021

Exactly how hungover are you?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.665
I'm not.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.843
I am.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.714
Can't we just go next weekend?

01:02.758 --> 01:05.935
We could, but it would
just be an empty field then.

hoping is Roscoe's.

without him?

go places by myself.

slipped your mind?

What? I made a friend.

about Adam?Yes, I did.

about him?

downhill.

Well, there is no secret.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.739

could've made that meal better

out of the blue.

with him again?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.530
No, I am in love with Adam.

Then don't blow it up
over one mistake

13:57.358 --> 13:58.620
that you're never
gonna make again.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.187
But I feel so guilty.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.449
And you should.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.885
But you don't get to hurt Adam

14:02.929 --> 14:04.191
just to make yourself
feel better.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.933
When did you get so smart?

14:06.976 --> 14:09.892
It's easy to fix
other people's problems.

14:09.936 --> 14:13.896
Meanwhile, I owe Jill $87,000.

14:16.507 --> 14:20.294
Crazy thought, did you try
looking in your jewelry box?

14:20.337 --> 14:22.078
Seriously, Mom?

14:22.122 --> 14:23.863
You're right, that was stupid.

things are my favorites?

I told the guy at the flower
shop I screwed up pretty bad,

14:41.489 --> 14:44.144
he said, "You're gonna want to
go with the long blue things."

14:44.187 --> 14:49.758
Well, thank you,
they're perfect.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.629
I'm really sorry
about last weekend.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.371

14:54.415 --> 14:56.504
No, no, I-I want
to say this.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.681
From now on, if I tell you that
I'm gonna go with you somewhere,

14:59.724 --> 15:02.597
I'm gonna go, 'cause I know
that I can count on you,

15:02.640 --> 15:06.209
and you deserve the same.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.261

15:14.304 --> 15:16.567
A guy kissed me tonight.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.960
What?

15:18.004 --> 15:22.008
I wasn't at dinner
with Marjorie.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.967
I was with a guy I met
at the food festival.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.404
Hold on.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.972
[chuckles]

15:30.016 --> 15:31.234
You're seeing somebody else?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.715
Not seeing-- we're just friends.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.978
CHRISTY:
I found the necklace!Friends don't kiss.

15:36.022 --> 15:36.848
Bye.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.768
The important thing is
I stopped him.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.814
And that makes it okay?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.468
Well, the old Bonnie
would've slept with him

15:47.511 --> 15:48.817
without giving it
a second thought.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.558
You should be proud of me.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.212
Proud of you?

15:52.255 --> 15:53.865
Hey, I didn't shoot a puppy
today with a BB gun.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.389
Are you proud of me?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.869
Well, if you had a history
of shooting puppies,

15:57.913 --> 15:59.828
yeah, I would be.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.613
So tell me, what's the big
attraction for this guy, huh?

16:02.657 --> 16:05.051
Or are you just tired of being
with somebody in a wheelchair?

16:06.356 --> 16:07.967
That's what you think of me?

16:10.317 --> 16:14.625
You want to know
what I liked about him?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.018
He's sober.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
Oh, I should've guessed.
He's sober.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.675
I'm sorry, but there
is a difference.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.199
Sometimes when you're drinking
you can be right next to me

16:23.243 --> 16:25.506
and I feel completely alone.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.768
Yeah, well, I know another way

16:26.811 --> 16:28.030
to make you feel
completely alone.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.251
Are you kidding me?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.079
And I got news for you.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.691
It is also no picnic being
with someone who never drinks!

16:36.734 --> 16:38.562
Well, how would you know?
You'd be too hungover

16:38.606 --> 16:39.955
to even go to the picnic.

16:41.261 --> 16:45.221
Oh, my God, you made up
smelly Suzanne!

16:52.663 --> 16:54.056
Here you go,
one diamond necklace.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.405
Thank you.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.234
You all saw it, it is
officially returned.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.803
Oh, that is
so beautiful.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.327
I'll never own
anything that nice.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.589
Sure you will.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.851
Here.

17:06.895 --> 17:07.590
What?

17:08.636 --> 17:09.984
You're giving it to her?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.421
It's just a glass knock-off.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.423
I keep the real one
in a safe deposit box.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.339
Why didn't you tell me?!

17:16.383 --> 17:19.777
Well, if you knew it was fake,
you wouldn't feel special.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.040
Have you met me?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.824
I never feel special!

17:22.867 --> 17:25.305
Okay, well, next time I'll
let you borrow the real one.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.742
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.224
Bonnie, stop
checking your phone.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.095
He'll call
when he calls.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
I don't know what I
was thinking with Joe.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.578
Well, maybe you
liked the danger.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.840
What are you
talking about?

17:38.883 --> 17:40.755
Oh, come on,
when we were drinking,

17:40.798 --> 17:42.670
our lives were
packed with drama.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
Sometimes when you're
sober, you miss that.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.587
I know I do.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.589
There was a time where
I'd pick up a glass of champagne

17:48.632 --> 17:50.112
in L.A. and wake up in Paris.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.375
Same thing
happened to me,

17:52.419 --> 17:55.074
except I woke up
in a panel van.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.081
I sure don't
miss the drama.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.735
Waking up with no idea
where my car is,

18:04.779 --> 18:07.608
or who autographed
my boob with a Sharpie.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.393
Oh, I bet you were
a fun drunk.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.439
You'd think, but no.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.355
[phone chimes]

18:15.398 --> 18:17.226
Oh, God, it's Adam.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.798
He said he'll be...

18:23.841 --> 18:25.626
[chuckles] out of his
apartment this afternoon

18:25.669 --> 18:28.063
[voice breaking]: and I can
come pick up my stuff.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.329
Oh, Bonnie.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.984
[sighs]

18:37.855 --> 18:39.988
The only relationship
that lasts forever

18:40.031 --> 18:43.209
is the one we have
with ourselves.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.427
[clicks tongue]

18:50.520 --> 18:52.392
Yeah, I deserved that.
