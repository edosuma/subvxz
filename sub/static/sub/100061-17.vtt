WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:03.406
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:04.398 --> 00:07.296
You will return to
your task force on Hawaii,

00:07.321 --> 00:10.952
to be my eyes and ears inside Five-O.

00:12.531 --> 00:13.843
- Adam.
- I'm sorry

00:13.868 --> 00:16.242
I was gone so long. I
just had to get away.

00:16.804 --> 00:18.343
Welcome home, bro.

00:18.368 --> 00:20.093
If you're so suspicious of the guy,

00:20.118 --> 00:21.460
why'd you welcome him back to the team?

00:21.484 --> 00:22.928
I want him where
I can keep an eye on him.

00:22.952 --> 00:25.222
HPD's actually looking
to shift more resources

00:25.247 --> 00:27.592
to Filipino territory.
It's all in there.

00:27.617 --> 00:30.249
Noshimuri. Watch your back.

00:30.274 --> 00:31.663
You sure this is safe?

00:31.688 --> 00:33.656
It's a hell of a lot
safer than the last spot.

00:33.681 --> 00:35.593
HPD's gonna be all over that
location tomorrow morning.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.921
Yeah, interesting how that happened.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.222
I suggest you keep your
theories to yourself, Endo,

00:40.247 --> 00:42.782
or I'll be burying four
bodies tonight, not three.

00:47.562 --> 00:50.749
_

00:53.595 --> 00:55.515
Come back to bed.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.287
I wish I could, Ms.
Townsend, but I really must

01:03.312 --> 01:04.965
get back to work.

01:06.624 --> 01:08.393
Well, my dinner's gone cold,

01:08.418 --> 01:10.986
so... I may have to order
more room service later.

01:13.023 --> 01:14.356
About that...

01:15.359 --> 01:16.358
I, um,

01:17.777 --> 01:19.538
I have a confession to make.

01:24.225 --> 01:25.670
When I found out you
were staying with us,

01:25.695 --> 01:28.273
I asked if I could bring
your dinner to the room.

01:28.432 --> 01:31.804
You see, I am a big fan of
your Deirdre Naismith novels

01:31.829 --> 01:33.941
and I was hoping you
might autograph my copy

01:33.966 --> 01:36.101
of Murder at the Crossing.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.507
What's the matter?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.646
Didn't I give you
enough to remember me by?

01:40.671 --> 01:42.785
N-No. No... uh, yes.

01:42.810 --> 01:44.343
Y-Yes, you did. Of course.

01:44.368 --> 01:47.272
I-I... It's just...

01:47.297 --> 01:48.865
Oh, dear boy, I'm only joking.

01:49.575 --> 01:51.679
It would be a pleasure
to sign your book.

01:57.177 --> 01:59.382
"To my number one fan,

01:59.585 --> 02:00.885
"Leo.

02:01.114 --> 02:05.148
"You've got a devoted fan in me.

02:05.442 --> 02:08.820
With love, Maureen Townsend."

02:11.241 --> 02:12.574
Thank you.

02:13.851 --> 02:15.475
May I ask,

02:15.548 --> 02:17.482
when can we expect a new Deirdre book?

02:18.775 --> 02:20.389
Not anytime soon.

02:22.228 --> 02:24.725
That was supposed to be
the next novel, but...

02:25.671 --> 02:27.930
Well, you can see what I think of it.

02:27.998 --> 02:30.099
Y-You mean to tell me

02:30.124 --> 02:33.539
that's... an entire
Deirdre Naismith novel

02:33.564 --> 02:35.765
the whole world will never see?

02:42.284 --> 02:44.685
Sometimes you have to know
when to let things die.

Hey. I'm Reigns.

04:09.899 --> 04:11.667
Welcome home, Mr. Reigns.

04:11.778 --> 04:15.170
- Can I take your bag?
- No, but I'll take a hug.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.851
I'm happy you're home safe.

04:21.877 --> 04:23.488
It's good to see you.

04:34.473 --> 04:37.159
So, how was everything over there?

04:37.270 --> 04:38.637
I mean, I-I know you're not allowed

04:38.662 --> 04:40.429
to talk about the details,

04:40.497 --> 04:44.168
but, like, how did it go?

04:44.684 --> 04:46.137
Yeah, it was good.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.762
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:48.223 --> 04:50.072
Hey, uh, take a right up here.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.441
Uh, okay.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.709
Uh, where are we going?

04:54.230 --> 04:56.504
Just take the right.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.425
Okay.

05:20.870 --> 05:22.004
What exactly... ?

05:26.129 --> 05:28.620
Been thinking about
this ever since I left.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.466
That was nice.

06:03.491 --> 06:05.365
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

06:06.082 --> 06:09.351
I can't say I, uh, thought
it was gonna be in a car.

06:09.654 --> 06:12.364
Well... you're the one
who told me to pull over.

06:15.345 --> 06:16.849
Come here.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.163
Thank you so much.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.288
Living here all these years,

06:36.312 --> 06:39.114
- it's my first time at this festival.
- _

06:39.182 --> 06:40.422
Well, it's a literary festival.

06:40.450 --> 06:41.884
It's for people who like to read.

06:41.909 --> 06:43.210
- I like to read.
- Really?

06:43.235 --> 06:45.070
Yeah, really.

06:45.221 --> 06:47.533
What is that? I got a Tom Clancy
on my nightstand right now.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.335
I believe that you have it.
I just don't think you have

06:49.359 --> 06:51.370
the patience to sit down
and actually read the book.

06:51.437 --> 06:53.004
What are you, a bookworm?

06:53.029 --> 06:54.630
- I like to read.
- Uh-huh.

06:54.689 --> 06:57.249
Hey. There he is. Harry Langford.

06:57.367 --> 06:58.367
Hello, chaps.

06:58.435 --> 06:59.601
Lovely to see you.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.746
Good to see you. How you doing, buddy?

07:00.770 --> 07:02.037
Good. Good.

07:02.105 --> 07:03.639
So, why are we here?

07:03.807 --> 07:05.675
Yes, well, it, uh,

07:05.942 --> 07:07.709
it seems I've written
a best-selling book.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.311
I'm sorry, did you just say

07:09.378 --> 07:11.876
- you wrote a book?
- You wrote a best-selling book?

07:11.901 --> 07:13.492
Honestly, it's all very surreal.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.917
One day I just,

07:14.942 --> 07:16.751
um, well, I sat down and I
just started writing this thing.

07:16.776 --> 07:18.363
More out of boredom,
really, than anything.

07:18.387 --> 07:21.562
And, um, yeah. Based on
my experiences with a,

07:21.978 --> 07:25.002
with a generous dollop of
artistic license thrown in.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.470
Couple of weeks later,

07:26.495 --> 07:28.642
I have a manuscript, I send
it to a friend in publishing,

07:28.667 --> 07:31.132
and the next thing you know,
I've got a seven-figure book deal.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.878
- What?
- Just so, um,

07:33.236 --> 07:34.936
I don't think I'm losing my mind here,

07:34.961 --> 07:36.595
y-you wrote a book in two weeks,

07:36.620 --> 07:38.673
and then somebody gave you
a million dollars?

07:38.698 --> 07:40.466
$2 million, actually.

07:40.611 --> 07:44.579
- Sorry. So vulgar to talk numbers.
- No, I mean, I'm disgusted.

07:44.604 --> 07:45.805
He's disgusted,

07:45.830 --> 07:47.965
but I'm okay with you
paying for dinner tonight.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.290
It'll be my absolute pleasure.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.361
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Doyle.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.568
I'm delighted you liked it.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.071
What?

07:56.475 --> 07:57.892
- Yes.
- Harry.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.084
The dead drop

07:59.109 --> 08:00.920
- in Kalemegdan Park...
- What's the matter with you?

08:00.945 --> 08:02.112
Is based on real events.

08:03.407 --> 08:05.337
Belgrade is a beautiful city.

08:05.362 --> 08:07.189
I think you broke him.

08:07.214 --> 08:08.748
I didn't do anything. What'd I do?

08:08.951 --> 08:12.587
Belgrade can indeed
be a beautiful city, but...

08:12.612 --> 08:15.648
it can also be quite a dangerous one.

08:15.835 --> 08:17.587
- As I'm sure you remember.
- Ah.

08:17.612 --> 08:18.979
Okay, who-who's that?

08:19.004 --> 08:21.139
That is me.

08:21.164 --> 08:24.962
Or rather, my, um, literary alter ego

08:24.987 --> 08:25.987
Michael Blanton.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.875
- I-I'm confused.
- Me, too.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.669
Excellent. That was the idea.

08:30.822 --> 08:32.655
MI6 regulations state that I can't

08:32.681 --> 08:33.823
appear at any of these book events,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.515
in case my face ends up in the papers.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.150
- Ah.
- There are a number of people

08:37.176 --> 08:38.535
who would put two and two together,

08:38.561 --> 08:42.265
and, uh, I don't particularly
want a target on my back.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.820
Right. Isn't he a target now?

08:43.845 --> 08:45.439
Not while I've got my eye on him.

08:45.464 --> 08:48.032
And that guy is an
unemployed actor I hired.

08:48.057 --> 08:50.708
Lovely chap. But, uh,
whilst he looks the part,

08:50.733 --> 08:52.667
he doesn't have the chat
to go with that suit.

08:52.692 --> 08:54.192
Hence the, uh, earpiece.

08:54.217 --> 08:55.317
It's very, uh,

08:55.342 --> 08:56.809
it's very Cyrano of you.

08:56.997 --> 08:58.597
De Bergerac.

08:59.981 --> 09:02.886
Yes. My cunning plan seems
to be working out rather well.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.356
Mr. Blanton is making
quite the impression.

09:05.705 --> 09:08.408
Oh, that's me. Excuse
me for a second, please.

09:09.785 --> 09:10.885
Hey, Lou.

09:10.953 --> 09:13.221
- What do you got?
- Hey. Sorry to interrupt,

09:13.246 --> 09:14.724
but we got a hot one
that's moving pretty quick.

09:14.749 --> 09:16.799
HPD was called to two murder scenes

09:16.824 --> 09:18.605
this morning, and
they seem to be linked.

09:18.630 --> 09:20.164
Okay. How so?

09:20.763 --> 09:23.787
Okay, victim number one is Makeo Palila.

09:23.812 --> 09:26.314
He was a music teacher at Kuwili High.

09:26.381 --> 09:28.349
He was found this morning.

09:28.374 --> 09:30.742
He'd been garroted with
an antique ukulele string.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.069
Now, the killer takes
a handwritten note,

09:33.094 --> 09:34.395
pins it to the victim's chest.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.677
And the note has some
kind of quotations on it,

09:36.702 --> 09:38.536
and a name: Deirdre Naismith.

09:38.897 --> 09:40.294
Victim number two

09:40.319 --> 09:42.139
is Ilihia Makamae.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.264
She was a bookstore owner.

09:43.289 --> 09:44.559
Stabbed in the chest

09:44.584 --> 09:45.985
with a vintage letter opener.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.444
Same thing.

09:47.469 --> 09:50.271
Note from the killer,
handwritten, quotation,

09:50.296 --> 09:53.799
so on and so forth, and again
the name Deirdre Naismith.

09:53.824 --> 09:56.114
I'm gonna send you pictures right now.

09:56.139 --> 09:58.770
Who, uh, who is Deirdre Naismith?

09:58.795 --> 10:01.270
Well, Deirdre Naismith was
a fictional crime writer.

10:01.295 --> 10:04.513
And this character appeared
in a series of novels

10:04.538 --> 10:06.640
by an author named Maureen Townsend

10:06.665 --> 10:10.278
between the years 1917 and 1939.

10:10.432 --> 10:12.466
And before you even ask, yes.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.724
Whole lot of bodies
dropping in those books.

10:14.749 --> 10:18.252
So we're thinking these
murders are just the beginning?

10:18.904 --> 10:20.341
I just got off the phone with Duke.

10:20.366 --> 10:23.097
Apparently HPD struck out in
their search for Endo Tanaka.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.130
All right, they're saying
the trail's gone cold.

10:25.155 --> 10:27.122
Despite the fact that we have
every port and every airport

10:27.147 --> 10:30.304
on high alert, the fear is that Endo

10:30.329 --> 10:32.668
may find a way off this
island if he hasn't already.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.442
Well, that would
certainly fit the yakuza

10:34.467 --> 10:36.234
standard operating procedure.

10:36.406 --> 10:39.677
The last thing they want is
for Endo to fall into our hands.

10:39.702 --> 10:42.325
And the information
he has, it could pose

10:42.350 --> 10:44.364
an existential threat to
their entire business here.

10:44.389 --> 10:47.625
Yeah, I understand all that,
but I haven't given up yet. Okay?

10:48.802 --> 10:50.591
I know that, uh, over
the past few weeks,

10:50.616 --> 10:53.028
there's been some
tension between us, Adam.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.372
I also know that you did
what you did for good reasons.

10:58.476 --> 11:00.443
That's why I want you
to get back out there.

11:00.468 --> 11:02.450
I want you to get out there,
lean on your connections,

11:02.475 --> 11:04.887
find out what you can because
if Endo is still on this island,

11:04.912 --> 11:06.412
we need to bring him in.

11:06.776 --> 11:09.311
- Yes.
- Can you do that?

11:09.730 --> 11:12.199
- I can do that.
- Okay.

11:12.418 --> 11:13.484
Hey.

11:14.334 --> 11:16.794
I trust you. Okay?

11:18.705 --> 11:19.638
Thanks, Steve.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.466
Can I show you something?

11:24.399 --> 11:28.098
So, both of our victims had
traces of ether in their, uh,

11:28.123 --> 11:29.757
throat and mouth.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.844
All right, so they were, they
were... I mean, they were drugged

11:31.869 --> 11:32.950
before they were killed, but ether?

11:32.975 --> 11:36.122
That's a strange
choice for sedation, no?

11:36.147 --> 11:38.459
I was thinking that, too, but it
sort of goes with the whole, uh,

11:38.484 --> 11:40.285
M.O., you know, getting choked out

11:40.310 --> 11:41.900
with a ukulele string

11:41.925 --> 11:43.205
and stabbed with a letter opener.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.645
It's like a vintage murder art project

11:45.670 --> 11:47.771
or something, you know?

11:47.877 --> 11:49.177
Hey!

11:49.202 --> 11:52.148
My man. What's up, buddy?

11:52.173 --> 11:53.573
What's up? Welcome back.

11:53.598 --> 11:55.784
I have a confession... it's
very good to see you, by the way.

11:55.809 --> 11:57.177
Um, I've been sleeping in your bed.

11:57.202 --> 11:58.669
It's all good, man.

11:58.694 --> 11:59.895
It's just, you know,
it's good to be back.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.121
- Joon!
- Hey.

12:02.146 --> 12:03.479
What's up, Cap?

12:03.611 --> 12:04.845
Good to see you, man.

12:04.870 --> 12:06.871
What the hell you doing here, anyway?

12:06.896 --> 12:08.607
Shouldn't you be at home
with your feet all propped up,

12:08.632 --> 12:10.399
watching The Young and the Restless?

12:10.424 --> 12:12.614
- Mm, see, it's good to see you, Cap.
- Tell you what, man,

12:12.639 --> 12:14.513
you picked a head-scratcher
of a case to come back to.

12:14.538 --> 12:15.549
- Check it out.
- Speaking of which,

12:15.574 --> 12:17.661
I just got off the phone with the lab.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.770
They finished analyzing the content

12:19.795 --> 12:21.145
and the handwriting of those notes.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.481
And the ink from those
notes, by the way,

12:23.761 --> 12:25.195
from the 1920s.

12:25.220 --> 12:28.156
Preliminary handwriting
analysis confirms

12:28.181 --> 12:31.016
that both of those notes were
written in the handwriting

12:31.411 --> 12:33.309
- of Maureen Townsend.
- Wait a minute.

12:33.334 --> 12:36.895
We know from her bio
that Maureen died in 1974.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.654
Well, here's where it
gets a little weird.

12:38.896 --> 12:40.441
There was an Internet search.

12:40.466 --> 12:43.058
It turns out that none of
the sentences of those notes

12:43.083 --> 12:45.211
were found in any of
the published novels

12:45.279 --> 12:48.175
about this character Deirdre Naismith.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.059
But all is not lost,

12:50.084 --> 12:52.285
because I think I might
have identified somebody

12:52.332 --> 12:54.199
who can help us out.

12:54.224 --> 12:56.322
It turns out that there is a woman

12:56.347 --> 13:00.527
who is a world-renowned expert
on all things Maureen Townsend.

13:00.552 --> 13:03.954
Her name is Suzanne
Ridge. She's on the island.

13:03.979 --> 13:06.608
She plans to do a keynote speech today

13:06.633 --> 13:10.136
at the literary fair.

13:10.168 --> 13:12.475
- Just came from there.
- Well, you love books, so go back.

13:14.036 --> 13:16.499
Deirdre was Maureen's greatest creation.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.567
A crime writer who always
got invited into the most

13:18.602 --> 13:20.370
coveted dinner parties and events, where

13:20.438 --> 13:22.572
inevitably a murder would take place

13:22.597 --> 13:24.564
and she would help solve it.

13:24.589 --> 13:25.956
Here.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.454
This is an example

13:28.479 --> 13:31.314
of Maureen's handwriting,

13:31.339 --> 13:33.140
taken from her journal.

13:33.545 --> 13:35.622
You see how it matches

13:35.647 --> 13:37.587
those two notes that you showed me?

13:37.655 --> 13:39.422
Yeah, I can't tell the difference.

13:39.490 --> 13:42.692
Yes, but that is not what made the hair

13:42.760 --> 13:44.694
on the back of my neck stand on end.

13:44.762 --> 13:49.399
These quotations...
They are word-for-word

13:49.467 --> 13:50.934
copies of passages

13:50.959 --> 13:53.788
taken from an unpublished manuscript:

13:53.813 --> 13:55.147
Murder at the Colony.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.674
I'm sorry, Ms. Ridge, but if
it's an unpublished manuscript,

13:57.699 --> 13:58.699
how do you know about it?

13:58.724 --> 14:02.178
Well, rumors of this
manuscript have been

14:02.203 --> 14:04.221
swirling about for a hundred years.

14:04.246 --> 14:07.827
It's the great white whale in
the crime publishing industry.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.553
Thanks to my connections
to the Townsend estate,

14:10.621 --> 14:13.313
I was able to secure exclusive access

14:13.338 --> 14:15.953
to Maureen's letters and diaries.

14:15.978 --> 14:18.795
Now, at the time, she abandoned work

14:18.820 --> 14:21.755
on Murder at the
Colony in February 1920.

14:21.908 --> 14:24.643
There's mention in
her journal of a tryst

14:24.668 --> 14:26.621
with a dashing bellman.

14:26.646 --> 14:29.448
Imagine, what if he had taken

14:29.473 --> 14:31.993
her discarded papers that night? So...

14:33.520 --> 14:35.154
I went out on a flier.

14:35.179 --> 14:37.989
I reached out to the
bellman's descendants.

14:38.014 --> 14:41.751
And... I struck gold.

14:41.989 --> 14:43.796
The handwritten manuscript

14:43.821 --> 14:47.241
had been in the family the whole time,

14:47.266 --> 14:49.677
stuffed away in a box in the attic.

14:49.958 --> 14:53.129
It was in remarkable condition.

14:53.154 --> 14:55.088
A complete first draft of the book.

14:55.113 --> 14:57.614
With a little bit of persuasion...

14:58.161 --> 15:01.104
I managed to secure exclusive rights.

15:01.172 --> 15:04.550
And, at my festival talk today,

15:04.575 --> 15:06.385
I'm finally going to unveil

15:06.410 --> 15:08.878
Maureen's plans for the last installment

15:08.903 --> 15:11.448
in the Deirdre Naismith series.

15:11.473 --> 15:14.050
Do you realize, what you just said

15:14.075 --> 15:15.315
makes you a person of interest?

15:15.667 --> 15:18.421
Absolutely.

15:18.446 --> 15:21.348
Your prime suspect, I expect.

15:22.784 --> 15:24.336
That doesn't worry you at all?

15:24.361 --> 15:26.563
A little bit, perhaps.

15:26.673 --> 15:29.308
But, honestly, to be incriminated

15:29.333 --> 15:31.801
in a real-life murder investigation,

15:32.278 --> 15:34.013
it's a little bit of a thrill.

15:35.218 --> 15:37.751
Uh, well, in that case, uh,
where were you this morning

15:37.775 --> 15:39.527
between 6:00 and 8:00?

15:39.552 --> 15:43.298
Well, I ordered room
service at that time,

15:43.323 --> 15:46.926
uh, and Kevin, my assistant,
took his breakfast with me,

15:46.951 --> 15:48.653
and we went through my
schedule for the day.

15:48.678 --> 15:52.122
Okay, well, we're gonna have
to verify that alibi, of course,

15:52.147 --> 15:55.601
and, um, check with the bellman's family

15:55.626 --> 15:57.370
- to make sure your story's accurate.
- Of course.

15:57.394 --> 15:58.705
- I'll text Lou.
- While we wait on that,

15:58.729 --> 16:01.064
what can you tell me about
the victims in the novel?

16:01.089 --> 16:03.075
I mean, if this killer really is using

16:03.100 --> 16:05.068
this story as a blueprint,
what can we expect?

16:05.093 --> 16:06.345
There were four deaths in all.

16:06.370 --> 16:09.806
The first victim was
garroted in the salon.

16:09.831 --> 16:13.219
The second, stabbed in the library.

16:13.244 --> 16:14.454
Okay, so our guy's not done yet.

16:14.478 --> 16:16.346
The third murder

16:16.413 --> 16:18.815
was the butler at the colonial mansion,

16:18.840 --> 16:19.873
where the book was set.

16:19.898 --> 16:22.941
His nightcap... poisoned with arsenic.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.839
Okay, wha-what about the fourth?

16:26.995 --> 16:29.978
It appears, from Maureen's diaries,

16:30.003 --> 16:33.873
that Maureen felt
imprisoned by the success

16:33.898 --> 16:35.765
of the Deirdre Naismith character.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.044
She wanted to flex her muscles
and write something else.

16:39.308 --> 16:41.671
So, her plan for Murder at the Colony

16:41.696 --> 16:43.782
was to end the book by killing off

16:43.807 --> 16:47.535
her most successful creation,
Deirdre Naismith herself.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.998
She planned to send her off in

16:50.023 --> 16:52.491
gloriously tragic fashion...

16:52.516 --> 16:54.369
Tossing her over the side

16:54.394 --> 16:57.080
of a red and blue sailboat

16:57.105 --> 17:00.356
into the crystal waters off Oahu,

17:00.466 --> 17:01.600
an anchor

17:02.105 --> 17:03.793
tied to her foot,

17:03.818 --> 17:05.308
weighing her down.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.597
But, as history shows,

17:07.622 --> 17:10.191
Townsend couldn't bring herself to do it

17:10.363 --> 17:12.978
and she threw the manuscript away.

17:13.002 --> 17:15.771
Suzanne, you are about to publish

17:15.797 --> 17:19.519
the complete text of the
final case of Deirdre Naismith.

17:19.777 --> 17:20.874
It's highly likely you

17:20.898 --> 17:22.799
- could be the fourth victim.
- Oh...

17:22.824 --> 17:24.321
Yeah, so I-I think you
should probably cancel

17:24.347 --> 17:25.714
that talk today,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.347
just until we figure
out what's going on.

17:27.372 --> 17:30.711
No... No. I can't cancel this event.

17:30.864 --> 17:33.599
It's been planned to coincide
with the 100th anniversary

17:33.624 --> 17:37.293
to the day of when Maureen
threw her masterpiece

17:37.318 --> 17:38.558
into the trash.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.863
Fans and literary press have traveled

17:40.888 --> 17:43.399
from all around the world.
I am not going to let

17:43.424 --> 17:46.652
some psychopath steal
this moment from me.

17:47.881 --> 17:49.315
From Maureen!

17:49.340 --> 17:50.640
Besides, if I just

17:50.665 --> 17:53.714
avoid the ocean and
sailboats, I'll be fine.

17:55.755 --> 17:57.995
Mm, Kevin,

17:58.020 --> 18:00.283
this is Commander McGarrett

18:00.308 --> 18:02.542
and Detective Williams.

18:02.567 --> 18:03.667
Pleasure to meet you both.

18:03.864 --> 18:05.831
These books need dedications for some

18:05.856 --> 18:07.223
of our VIP guests.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.460
Oh!

18:10.570 --> 18:14.206
This is one of my most

18:14.231 --> 18:15.798
treasured possessions.

18:15.823 --> 18:19.042
It actually belonged to Maureen herself.

18:20.004 --> 18:21.204
- Huh.
- Fancy pen.

18:21.272 --> 18:23.039
How did you, how'd you end up owning it?

18:23.107 --> 18:24.173
A fan

18:24.198 --> 18:26.166
gave it to me at a book signing

18:26.191 --> 18:28.425
in Minneapolis about a year ago.

18:28.450 --> 18:29.850
Hmm.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.614
No chance you got that fan's name?

18:31.682 --> 18:32.682
No.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.284
It was wrapped when he gave it to me,

18:34.309 --> 18:36.714
so I had no idea what a...

18:36.739 --> 18:38.265
special gift it was until I opened it

18:38.289 --> 18:39.656
at the hotel later that night.

18:39.681 --> 18:41.015
May I see it?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.140
Well, yes, certainly.

18:42.165 --> 18:43.298
Thank you.

18:49.768 --> 18:52.537
- Oh, that's a nice pen.
- Mm-hmm.

19:00.077 --> 19:01.477
What on earth is that?

19:01.502 --> 19:03.436
It looks to me like a transmitter.

19:03.461 --> 19:05.457
So, if this pen was in close proximity

19:05.482 --> 19:06.726
to your laptop, that would enable

19:06.750 --> 19:08.685
somebody to get access
to the hard drive.

19:08.752 --> 19:10.776
Yeah, and you'd have no idea.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.899
Well, it seems like we just
figured out how somebody else

19:12.923 --> 19:14.557
got their hands on that manuscript.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.161
Hey. Hey.

19:18.314 --> 19:19.848
So, no surprises, but alibis

19:19.873 --> 19:21.440
for both Suzanne Ridge and her assistant

19:21.465 --> 19:23.499
Kevin Tapley both checked out.

19:23.524 --> 19:25.191
According to hotel records,

19:25.216 --> 19:27.591
Suzanne ordered breakfast
for her and Kevin.

19:27.616 --> 19:29.617
The room service runner delivered it,

19:29.642 --> 19:31.977
and he remembers this vividly,
because Suzanne tipped him

19:32.002 --> 19:33.002
a hundred bucks.

19:33.027 --> 19:34.594
And cell records also place them

19:34.619 --> 19:36.179
at the hotel at the time of the murders.

19:36.204 --> 19:38.605
All right, we-we have this
new evidence that says somebody

19:38.630 --> 19:40.259
could have absolutely
gotten that-that manuscript

19:40.284 --> 19:41.551
from Suzanne's laptop.

19:41.576 --> 19:42.843
And, about that,

19:42.868 --> 19:44.840
lab confirmed exactly what you thought.

19:44.865 --> 19:47.587
That device you found in Suzanne's pen,

19:47.612 --> 19:50.460
that would have enabled
anybody on the receiving end

19:50.485 --> 19:52.671
to grab files from any
computer within range,

19:52.696 --> 19:56.346
including this theoretically
protected manuscript.

19:56.371 --> 19:57.977
So, not only did the
killer get a sneak preview

19:58.001 --> 19:59.335
of how the book ended,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.423
by obtaining the handwritten manuscript,

20:01.448 --> 20:03.315
he was able to trace
the relevant passages,

20:03.340 --> 20:05.635
and then produce those notes
that he left on the victims.

20:05.660 --> 20:07.407
It was very smart,
giving Suzanne that pen.

20:07.432 --> 20:09.988
All right, let's look
at auction catalogs,

20:10.013 --> 20:11.191
see if we can find evidence of the sale.

20:11.215 --> 20:12.666
Okay, if we can ID the guy

20:12.691 --> 20:14.626
who gave it to her, then
we're one step closer

20:14.651 --> 20:16.018
to finding our killer.

20:33.393 --> 20:34.513
The name

20:34.538 --> 20:36.072
is Blanton.

20:36.873 --> 20:38.409
Michael Blanton.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.430
Pleasure to meet you.

20:43.635 --> 20:45.557
Double-oh-seven?

20:45.987 --> 20:48.417
Try triple... oh-seven.

20:51.147 --> 20:52.675
Harry?

21:04.878 --> 21:07.298
Thank you very much, appreciate it.

21:07.323 --> 21:09.024
Junior, Tani, thanks for coming.

21:09.049 --> 21:10.503
Yeah. Of course. Any more developments?

21:10.528 --> 21:13.063
Actually, yes, but,
uh, let's go over here.

21:13.268 --> 21:15.397
Um, as McGarrett no doubt told you,

21:15.422 --> 21:17.823
I've been using an earpiece to
feed my actor chap his lines.

21:17.848 --> 21:19.787
When the, uh, device
wasn't transmitting earlier,

21:19.812 --> 21:22.096
I feared the worst, but in
the last couple of minutes,

21:22.121 --> 21:23.346
he switched it back on again.

21:23.371 --> 21:26.551
Now, he's rolling around
in the trunk of a car.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.876
Here, this is live.

21:27.901 --> 21:29.753
Please, I'm not who you think I am!

21:29.778 --> 21:31.440
I'm an actor! My name's
Gabe Darsyk! Please...

21:31.465 --> 21:32.765
Come on.

21:33.316 --> 21:35.862
All right, well, the good
news is, he's still alive.

21:35.887 --> 21:37.768
Yes, but he could be in
an awful lot of trouble.

21:37.793 --> 21:39.206
Right, because the
kidnappers think it's you

21:39.231 --> 21:41.370
in the trunk of the car. The super spy

21:41.395 --> 21:42.639
with a head full of state secrets.

21:42.664 --> 21:44.275
They're probably taking him
somewhere to rendition him.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.845
Or it could be one
of many injured

21:45.870 --> 21:47.409
parties I've pissed
off over the years.

21:47.434 --> 21:49.184
And I take it that's
quite a long list.

21:49.721 --> 21:51.209
Well, I can't lie,

21:51.234 --> 21:52.667
but this could turn
very nasty, very quickly.

21:52.692 --> 21:54.526
Harry, you got to help me, please.

21:54.551 --> 21:56.495
We will. Don't worry.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.954
I'm assuming you can't

21:57.979 --> 21:59.089
tell us where they're taking you.

21:59.114 --> 22:00.378
No. No.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.346
They haven't said, and I can't
see anything from in here.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.520
Please, Harry,

22:05.545 --> 22:07.458
please help me. I
don't want to die, man.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.061
All right, Harry, we might
be able to use your comms link

22:10.086 --> 22:11.253
to try and trace a signal.

22:11.778 --> 22:13.111
Tani.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.040
Yeah, one step ahead of you.

22:29.925 --> 22:31.237
Hey, you got something?

22:31.262 --> 22:34.612
Yes, sir. Per your
request, we have procured

22:34.637 --> 22:37.503
a list of attendees for last
year's event in Minneapolis.

22:37.528 --> 22:39.526
That's where Suzanne got the pen.

22:39.551 --> 22:41.052
Then we cross-referenced these names

22:41.077 --> 22:42.611
against TSA records,

22:42.636 --> 22:44.403
travel records to Oahu.

22:44.526 --> 22:46.905
Okay, we're just playing the
odds here, but I-I'm pretty sure

22:46.930 --> 22:49.398
our killer isn't the
only Maureen Townsend fan

22:49.441 --> 22:51.081
- that would've made the trip.
- Right again.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.323
There were four
attendees from last year's

22:53.348 --> 22:56.784
event that came here
to hear Suzanne talk, so...

22:56.809 --> 23:00.362
we texted their photo to
Suzanne's phone to see if

23:00.387 --> 23:01.754
she knew any of 'em.

23:01.779 --> 23:03.580
Had our answer in about 15 seconds.

23:04.276 --> 23:05.907
Collin Hansen

23:05.932 --> 23:08.267
is who she ID'd. Um, he's a mechanic,

23:08.292 --> 23:09.597
no kids, never been married.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.222
He's been on Oahu for three days.

23:11.247 --> 23:12.648
Well, I'm pretty sure we can guess

23:12.673 --> 23:15.275
how this guy's been whiling
away his hours while he's been

23:15.300 --> 23:17.159
on the island. All right, we
got to, we got to grab this guy,

23:17.207 --> 23:18.767
and quick, before he drops another body.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.792
Oh, business must be good.

23:38.932 --> 23:40.785
I heard you've been
making the rounds today,

23:40.810 --> 23:42.344
asking questions.

23:42.369 --> 23:43.669
Just one.

23:44.586 --> 23:45.886
Where's Haru?

23:46.415 --> 23:48.025
You seem concerned.

23:48.457 --> 23:50.625
I didn't know you cared about Haru.

23:50.662 --> 23:53.175
He was my contact for information.

23:53.656 --> 23:55.495
I'll have a new contact for you soon.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.262
Where is he?

24:00.330 --> 24:01.862
I put him on a plane.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.565
He's taking care of
something for me in Japan.

24:06.135 --> 24:07.557
In Japan, huh?

24:07.909 --> 24:09.409
That's right.

24:09.593 --> 24:12.829
And what about Endo? He in Japan, too?

24:16.729 --> 24:18.289
If you're feeling the pressure

24:18.314 --> 24:20.971
of living this double
life of yours, let me know.

24:21.815 --> 24:24.573
I'd be more than happy to
put you on a plane, too.

24:28.157 --> 24:30.392
I hope you got good insurance
on this rental, Harry.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.167
Right now that's the least
of my worries. Drive it

24:32.192 --> 24:34.627
- like you stole it, my friend.
- If you insist.

24:38.612 --> 24:41.112
Okay. According to the trace

24:41.137 --> 24:43.472
on Gabe's earpiece,
they're still on the move.

24:43.497 --> 24:45.297
Kidnappers are heading
north through Nanakuli.

24:46.415 --> 24:47.581
Oh, wait.

24:47.782 --> 24:50.083
It looks like their little
drive's come to an end.

24:50.108 --> 24:52.476
The signal stopped moving
outside a warehouse at what

24:52.501 --> 24:55.069
looks to be the intersection
of Ma'aloa and Mahihi.

24:55.418 --> 24:57.496
Okay, I'll call HPD. I'll
have them set up a perimeter

24:57.520 --> 24:58.787
and wait for us there.

24:58.812 --> 25:01.632
Listen, please. I-I-I know
you guys think I'm, like,

25:01.657 --> 25:04.259
this treasure trove, like, of,
like, sensitive intelligence

25:04.284 --> 25:06.485
or whatever, but I'm telling
you, I'm just an actor.

25:06.510 --> 25:08.542
All right, y-y-you
could look me up.

25:08.567 --> 25:10.412
Look me up. I-I went to
University of Cincinnati,

25:10.437 --> 25:12.433
- School of Drama, class of 2011.
- Shut up!

25:12.458 --> 25:13.625
Okay! Just,

25:13.903 --> 25:16.772
please, look, I'm from Mason City, Iowa.

25:16.797 --> 25:19.032
I am, like, the least British
person you have ever met.

25:19.057 --> 25:20.938
Here. Now transfer the money.

25:20.963 --> 25:23.547
- Money? What money?
- Oh, that's not good.

25:23.572 --> 25:25.690
Your money, slick. We read your book.

25:25.715 --> 25:26.982
We know about the gold

25:27.007 --> 25:29.109
in Switzerland, bank
accounts all over the world.

25:29.134 --> 25:31.528
- We're taking every single penny.
- That's what

25:31.553 --> 25:33.698
I'm trying to tell you. I
didn't write the damn book, okay?

25:33.723 --> 25:35.643
I have, like, 60 bucks...
You think that we're stupid?

25:35.668 --> 25:37.859
No! Hey, we know you got
a million dollar advance.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.901
But I don't have the money.

25:39.926 --> 25:42.540
Okay, okay, wh-wh-whoa-whoa. Okay.

25:42.565 --> 25:45.033
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Pay attention, pay attention.

25:45.058 --> 25:46.736
See that right there?
That is our account number

25:46.761 --> 25:48.328
to First Island Bank of West Bay

25:48.353 --> 25:49.653
Okay.

25:49.686 --> 25:51.625
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:51.650 --> 25:52.917
Start the transfers.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.510
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Do it now.

25:56.339 --> 25:58.707
- Or eat a bullet.
- Okay.

25:59.807 --> 26:02.751
- _
- Collin Hansen. Five-O. Open up.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.499
- Clear.
- Clear.

26:18.847 --> 26:20.691
Take a look at this.

26:20.773 --> 26:23.642
These are photocopies of the manuscript.

26:24.006 --> 26:27.943
These are the same sentences
that appear on the murder notes.

26:27.968 --> 26:29.836
Look at this tracing paper.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.161
He's been tracing Maureen
Townsend's handwriting

26:32.186 --> 26:34.354
until he got it down.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.677
Yeah, Noelani, go ahead.

26:38.702 --> 26:41.022
Another body and
another handwritten note.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.915
The circumstances of
this murder match the M.O.

26:42.940 --> 26:44.300
of your killer. I'm in the backyard

26:44.325 --> 26:46.647
of a private residence here in Makiki.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.480
The license in the vic's
pocket lists him as Joel Butler.

26:50.505 --> 26:52.033
There's your Butler.

26:52.101 --> 26:53.820
All right, you got a cause of death?

26:53.845 --> 26:56.280
Officially, no, but I can
make an educated guess.

26:56.305 --> 26:58.773
I found this vintage bottle of arsenic

26:58.798 --> 27:00.942
placed deliberately
next to our vic's body.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.653
Well, that certainly tracks right along

27:02.678 --> 27:04.481
with the vintage methods of murder

27:04.506 --> 27:05.716
that we've been looking at.

27:05.741 --> 27:08.743
I also found a human hair by the bottle.

27:08.991 --> 27:10.942
It didn't match our
vic's, so I ran it, but

27:10.982 --> 27:13.294
- the DNA wasn't in our system.
- All right, keep us posted,

27:13.319 --> 27:14.853
Noelani. We'll be in touch, all right?

27:17.099 --> 27:18.627
This is troubling.

27:19.022 --> 27:20.823
What do you got?

27:25.412 --> 27:27.013
She's next.

27:27.038 --> 27:28.981
If she doesn't cancel
that talk right now,

27:29.083 --> 27:30.783
she's a sitting duck.

27:32.497 --> 27:35.277
Gabe, it's going to be okay.

27:35.302 --> 27:36.769
We're a couple of minutes out.

27:36.837 --> 27:39.294
I want you to do what
the kidnappers are asking.

27:39.319 --> 27:42.013
Go to my bank's website, Taft London.

27:42.038 --> 27:44.687
Transfer them all of my money.

27:44.712 --> 27:47.537
The entire balance of ten million.

27:48.107 --> 27:49.590
Dollars?

27:50.960 --> 27:54.496
Gabe, if you're ready for the
password, clear your throat.

27:55.747 --> 27:56.781
Very good.

27:56.813 --> 27:59.682
Okay, the login name is HarryL1.

27:59.707 --> 28:01.441
The password is all caps...

28:01.466 --> 28:04.966
LAN6F0RD... with a six for
the "G" and a zero for the "O."

28:04.991 --> 28:07.793
You know, for a spy, you really
should have a stronger password.

28:08.326 --> 28:09.426
I'm just saying.

28:16.143 --> 28:17.510
_

28:17.578 --> 28:19.612
Damn it.

28:19.637 --> 28:20.832
Stop screwing with us.

28:20.857 --> 28:23.527
Gabe, cough again if you need
me to repeat the password.

28:23.552 --> 28:25.269
And enter the password now.

28:25.294 --> 28:26.827
Gabe, did you hear me?

28:26.852 --> 28:29.187
I said clear your throat
if you need the password.

28:29.212 --> 28:30.847
Say it louder this time.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.748
The hell are you talking about?

28:34.773 --> 28:35.873
Uh...

28:36.138 --> 28:37.806
Nothing. Uh... nothing.

28:37.831 --> 28:39.098
I was just talking to myself.

28:39.123 --> 28:41.357
I think the question is...

28:44.144 --> 28:46.839
- who's he talking to?
- Okay, okay.

28:46.864 --> 28:48.131
Wait, wait, just...

28:48.156 --> 28:49.690
I don't know who the hell is listening,

28:49.715 --> 28:52.150
but I'm gonna spare you
having to hear your friend die.

28:52.432 --> 28:53.599
Harry!

29:52.624 --> 29:54.625
You sure you don't want
us to come with you?

29:54.787 --> 29:57.293
Trust me. I got Gabe
into a total dog's dinner.

29:57.318 --> 29:58.685
I'm the one to get him out.

29:58.710 --> 30:00.793
All right, well,
at least take a gun with you.

30:00.949 --> 30:02.519
Afraid not. Going
in unarmed is the,

30:02.544 --> 30:04.433
Besides, uh, surest path to success.

30:04.458 --> 30:07.119
if I need a gun, I'll, um,

30:07.144 --> 30:09.004
I'll just borrow one
from the kidnappers.

30:17.077 --> 30:18.845
Hello, chaps. Now, now,

30:19.223 --> 30:20.957
let's not act rashly,

30:21.300 --> 30:23.386
not when I'm here to make
sure you get your money.

30:23.525 --> 30:25.926
That's right. I'm the
gentleman you're after,

30:26.111 --> 30:27.712
spy turned memoirist.

30:27.737 --> 30:30.105
This poor lad is just
an actor I hired to, uh,

30:30.130 --> 30:31.631
to be my public face.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.937
I'm unarmed,

30:33.962 --> 30:36.074
and I will happily wire you the money

30:36.099 --> 30:38.732
if you stay calm and
ensure nobody gets hurt.

30:38.757 --> 30:40.746
And considering you've read my book...

30:40.771 --> 30:42.872
Thanks for the support, truly,

30:43.049 --> 30:44.950
you've no idea what a brutal business

30:44.975 --> 30:46.843
publishing is, and
every little bit helps...

30:47.582 --> 30:48.941
You'll know

30:48.966 --> 30:53.069
that, um, it's no idle threat

30:53.094 --> 30:55.738
when I tell you that, if
you become unreasonable,

30:55.819 --> 30:58.644
I'm going to have to put you both down.

30:59.885 --> 31:01.143
So...

31:01.168 --> 31:02.702
shall we do this the nice way?

31:10.076 --> 31:12.268
Get up, get up, get up.

31:13.463 --> 31:16.446
Make it fast. No funny stuff.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.729
Wouldn't dream of it.

31:40.194 --> 31:42.194
_

31:44.774 --> 31:46.875
Done. The money's all yours.

31:46.900 --> 31:50.141
$10 million, not bad
for a morning's work.

31:50.328 --> 31:52.820
If it's all the same to you, my friend
and I will take our leave.

31:52.845 --> 31:54.563
We have a signing event to get to,

31:54.588 --> 31:56.288
and I need to sell a book or two.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.047
Not so fast.

31:58.072 --> 32:00.640
You leave when we get
confirmation the money's there.

32:03.485 --> 32:04.725
The three homicides today

32:04.767 --> 32:06.712
match perfectly with the
murders in the book, okay?

32:06.737 --> 32:08.137
Come on, y-you really want your boss

32:08.162 --> 32:09.363
to be a match for the fourth?

32:09.388 --> 32:11.400
If it were up to me, Suzanne
would cancel the event,

32:11.425 --> 32:12.525
but she's headstrong.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.809
That said, you're more than welcome

32:13.834 --> 32:15.601
to try to convince her yourself.

32:15.626 --> 32:17.460
Okay, we can be pretty convincing.

32:17.485 --> 32:18.585
Officer, all quiet?

32:18.747 --> 32:19.947
Quiet as a mouse, Commander.

32:19.972 --> 32:20.972
Nobody been in or out.

32:22.389 --> 32:23.906
Ms. Ridge?

32:27.986 --> 32:29.250
Hello?

32:31.405 --> 32:33.070
Open it.

32:48.693 --> 32:50.063
Suzanne!

33:03.797 --> 33:05.594
I need a paramedic in here now!

33:05.619 --> 33:07.086
- Got it.
- No, no, no, no! Suzanne!

33:08.547 --> 33:10.594
Okay, stay with me.

33:10.619 --> 33:12.180
Come on, breathe, breathe.

33:13.087 --> 33:14.487
Suzanne.

33:15.816 --> 33:16.750
Oh, thank God.

33:16.775 --> 33:18.576
Suzanne, can you hear me?

33:18.601 --> 33:20.586
Suzanne, hey, hey.

33:22.683 --> 33:24.266
She's pretty out of it, man.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.959
I think Hansen must've ethered
her like he did the others.

33:28.813 --> 33:29.998
He left a note.

33:30.023 --> 33:31.422
What, does this look familiar to you?

33:31.447 --> 33:32.927
Looks like the last page of the novel.

33:34.516 --> 33:36.500
Hey, Danny, look at that.

33:37.195 --> 33:39.352
- Hey, John McClane.
- All right.

33:39.377 --> 33:41.820
We need to lock down this
hotel, update the APB.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.906
I want every cop on the island
looking for Collin Hansen.

33:43.931 --> 33:45.042
He couldn't have gotten very far.

33:45.298 --> 33:47.065
Now, that's what I like to hear.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.406
Just spoke to our man in the Caymans.

33:49.431 --> 33:50.680
The money came through.

33:51.009 --> 33:53.070
And he's cashing it as we speak.

33:53.494 --> 33:56.375
And with that... we'll be on our way.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.768
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

34:02.594 --> 34:04.490
What kind of a plan was that?!

34:04.515 --> 34:06.703
Are you serious?! I thought you
were supposed to be some kind

34:06.728 --> 34:08.547
of a super spy. I
mean, that was the least

34:08.572 --> 34:10.473
James Bond thing I have ever seen...

34:10.498 --> 34:13.982
Just-just watching you roll over
and give those guys $10 million.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.632
Calm down, dear boy.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.672
It's all being handled.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.458
_

34:29.882 --> 34:31.500
Excuse me.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.775
I'll take that, thanks.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.078
All right, come on, let's go.

34:45.527 --> 34:47.295
Harry, dear.

34:47.417 --> 34:49.018
I got your money back.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.679
Maria, darling, I knew I could

34:51.705 --> 34:53.406
count on you... Thank you so much.

34:53.431 --> 34:56.391
Now, we didn't get to discuss terms.

34:56.416 --> 34:58.049
I assume you'll be taking a cut?

34:58.204 --> 35:01.055
Oh, Harry. That won't be necessary.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.781
'Cause I'll be taking it all.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.500
You should have called me
back when we were stationed

35:05.525 --> 35:06.688
in Athens.

35:07.286 --> 35:10.539
Live and learn, right, darling?

35:26.299 --> 35:27.766
Oh, dear.

35:46.101 --> 35:49.024
- How's it going?
- Have you made any progress

35:49.049 --> 35:50.555
in determining who that maniac was

35:50.580 --> 35:51.688
who tried to kill me?

35:51.713 --> 35:53.828
Yes and no. Uh, have you got a second?

35:53.853 --> 35:55.640
I know you're about to get onstage here.

35:55.665 --> 35:56.731
Of course.

35:56.764 --> 35:58.598
- Okay, good thing. May I?
- Sure.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.892
Um... okay, so, apparently, the killer

36:01.917 --> 36:03.628
came into your room
through the air vent, right?

36:03.653 --> 36:07.063
So, what we did, we-we
traced that air duct back

36:07.088 --> 36:09.164
to an access point,
hoping that maybe we could

36:09.189 --> 36:10.890
catch this person
on-on a security camera

36:10.915 --> 36:13.650
along the way, but
unfortunately that was a, uh,

36:13.707 --> 36:15.141
well, it was a dead end.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.566
The-the duct, it's been closed

36:16.591 --> 36:18.672
for-for a while, like,
that passage, they're

36:18.697 --> 36:20.899
working on the air conditioning
for the floor above,

36:20.924 --> 36:22.124
so it's blocked.

36:22.149 --> 36:23.583
In layman's terms, there is

36:23.608 --> 36:25.275
absolutely no way that anybody,

36:25.842 --> 36:27.242
let alone the, the killer,

36:27.267 --> 36:29.347
could have gotten into your
room through the ceiling.

36:29.402 --> 36:31.555
Plus, with an officer guarding the door

36:31.580 --> 36:33.814
and balcony windows ten stories up,

36:33.839 --> 36:36.040
we started figuring that maybe,

36:36.065 --> 36:39.656
just maybe, that, uh,
whoever's behind this...

36:39.988 --> 36:42.288
they were inside the
room the whole time.

36:42.313 --> 36:45.293
Look, you staged this
whole thing almost perfectly.

36:45.318 --> 36:47.719
I mean, you knew we'd
rush in to save you.

36:47.744 --> 36:50.189
And I'll be the first to admit,
your performance in the bathroom

36:50.533 --> 36:52.534
was very convincing,
but there is one thing

36:52.559 --> 36:54.036
that you could never have known about,

36:54.060 --> 36:55.628
and that was the sealed-off air duct.

36:59.031 --> 37:01.399
- That's crazy.
- That's crazy? I don't know.

37:01.424 --> 37:03.168
I don't know if it is crazy
when you think about what

37:03.193 --> 37:06.063
a steroid boost these murders
have been to your new book.

37:06.088 --> 37:09.547
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's pretty
wild out there. Standing room only.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.293
That's the kind of publicity

37:11.318 --> 37:12.785
some writers would kill for.

37:12.810 --> 37:14.641
And, by the way, we have

37:14.666 --> 37:17.484
a pretty good idea
who, uh, leaked the news

37:17.509 --> 37:20.644
of a murder investigation
out to those media vultures

37:20.669 --> 37:23.399
perched outside... Kevin.

37:23.424 --> 37:25.293
You can't prove any of that.

37:25.318 --> 37:27.553
Maybe not, but here's
something we can prove.

37:27.669 --> 37:30.037
Suzanne, while you were
in your room preparing

37:30.062 --> 37:32.230
for the finale of the
greatest publicity stunt

37:32.255 --> 37:33.622
I've ever heard of,

37:33.647 --> 37:35.617
Kevin here was out
doing your dirty work.

37:35.735 --> 37:39.008
You see, folks, as law 
enforcement officers,

37:39.033 --> 37:40.733
we're obligated to look further

37:40.758 --> 37:42.344
into your flimsy alibis.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.141
And when we did so, we found that

37:44.166 --> 37:47.135
Kevin here, well, his
didn't quite hold up.

37:47.638 --> 37:50.524
See, all you had going for
you in that case was your word

37:50.549 --> 37:52.483
and the presence of Kevin's cell phone

37:52.508 --> 37:54.442
to say that he was
in the hotel with you,

37:55.227 --> 37:56.965
but, come to find out,

37:56.990 --> 37:58.267
Kevin was someplace else altogether.

37:58.291 --> 37:59.224
Ain't that right, Kev?

37:59.249 --> 38:00.976
Kevin, we found blood,

38:01.001 --> 38:04.247
uh, in the trunk of
your, uh, rental car.

38:04.272 --> 38:08.093
I had CSU cross-reference the
DNA from the blood to the, uh,

38:08.118 --> 38:09.671
the hair on the arsenic bottle left

38:09.696 --> 38:10.843
at the third crime scene.

38:10.868 --> 38:12.367
Guess what, Kevin.

38:12.392 --> 38:14.211
Perfect DNA match.

38:14.236 --> 38:16.187
How'd that end up in your trunk, Kevin?

38:16.212 --> 38:17.846
You killed Collin Hansen

38:17.871 --> 38:19.078
and you put him in
the trunk of your car.

38:19.103 --> 38:21.921
That's right, 'cause
Collin Hansen didn't kill anybody.

38:23.226 --> 38:25.836
You just planted one of his
hairs on that arsenic bottle

38:25.861 --> 38:27.228
to set him up.

38:27.328 --> 38:28.861
Poor guy was just a fan of old

38:28.886 --> 38:30.531
crime stories... Little
did he know he'd end up

38:30.556 --> 38:32.089
being the victim of a new one.

38:32.789 --> 38:34.553
All right, so here's
what's gonna happen.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.579
You two are gonna come with us,

38:36.604 --> 38:38.215
and we're gonna have
you sit in some very,

38:38.239 --> 38:40.006
very uncomfortable chairs

38:40.031 --> 38:42.666
for as long as it
takes for you to tell us

38:42.818 --> 38:44.503
what you did with the body

38:44.528 --> 38:46.096
of poor Mr. Collin Hansen.

38:47.557 --> 38:50.565
Look, bracelets to go with your outfit.

38:50.590 --> 38:51.857
Come on.

39:06.366 --> 39:07.668
All right.

39:08.355 --> 39:09.762
- _
- Thanks for letting me

39:09.787 --> 39:11.137
- use the shower, man.
- Oh, least I could do.

39:11.256 --> 39:13.432
Yeah, yeah, that is true.

39:13.457 --> 39:14.724
Can I ask you a question?

39:14.749 --> 39:15.885
Uh, why would you

39:15.910 --> 39:17.469
check in to this baller suite

39:17.494 --> 39:19.777
right after you just
lost all your money?

39:19.802 --> 39:22.490
Oh, I may have lost some
money, but I certainly have not

39:22.557 --> 39:24.725
lost my taste for the
finer things in life.

39:25.669 --> 39:28.796
I have very fond
memories of this Leilani Suite.

39:28.864 --> 39:30.064
In fact, uh,

39:30.520 --> 39:32.409
you could say it's my happy place.

39:32.622 --> 39:34.535
It's your... Okay.

39:34.645 --> 39:35.745
Stay for a drink?

39:35.770 --> 39:38.223
No, I got to catch a flight.

39:38.402 --> 39:39.579
I have an audition first
thing in the morning.

39:39.717 --> 39:42.152
Oh, I hope it's for something exciting.

39:42.442 --> 39:45.864
- It's for a, uh, deodorant commercial.
- Ah.

39:45.889 --> 39:47.458
But, got to say, after working with you,

39:47.482 --> 39:50.818
I am very excited by the idea of boring.

39:50.886 --> 39:51.952
No offense.

39:51.977 --> 39:52.977
None taken.

39:53.002 --> 39:55.037
Thanks for everything.

39:55.062 --> 39:56.730
Thanks, Harry.

39:56.755 --> 39:58.756
Coming.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.406
Aha! Hey, good evening.

40:03.431 --> 40:04.942
- Here you go, buddy.
- Oh, you shouldn't have.

40:04.966 --> 40:06.477
I could call downstairs, get
them to send something up.

40:06.501 --> 40:07.434
You're on a budget.

40:07.502 --> 40:08.435
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:08.503 --> 40:09.503
- Hi.
- Hey, young lady.

40:09.538 --> 40:10.671
- Hey.
- Hello.

40:10.782 --> 40:13.083
Hey, you're not staying?

40:13.108 --> 40:15.009
No, I think I've, uh,

40:15.034 --> 40:16.820
had enough excitement for one lifetime.

40:16.887 --> 40:19.919
- So... enjoy.
- Goodbye.

40:21.716 --> 40:24.351
So, you, um, you lost
$10 million, that's, uh,

40:24.376 --> 40:25.810
that's a bummer.

40:25.921 --> 40:27.398
Well, to be honest, Daniel, retirement

40:27.423 --> 40:29.257
was beginning to bore me anyway.

40:30.140 --> 40:31.674
I don't know.

40:31.699 --> 40:33.734
- Maybe I'll go back to work.
- Yeah?

40:33.971 --> 40:35.171
'Cause if you want to work,

40:35.196 --> 40:37.464
there's a space on
this task force for you.

40:37.575 --> 40:39.009
Well, thank you, Steve.

40:39.076 --> 40:41.833
- But I don't want to do that much work.
- Ah.

40:41.858 --> 40:43.961
I was thinking of
something much more low-key.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.683
Yeah, well, I don't blame you.

40:46.708 --> 40:48.976
Guys, I think the show's about to start.

41:18.239 --> 41:19.340
Whoa!

42:26.618 --> 42:28.094
Got you.
