I'D WANT TO DO THE SAME.

ABOUT WHERE HE WAS

30:58.817 --> 31:00.439
HE WASN'T UPSTAIRS IN BED,

31:00.439 --> 31:03.322
BECAUSE CELIA THE MAID SAW HIM
IN THE KITCHEN.

KILLED ROGER.

KILLED ROGER

FOR A FEW HOURS.

31:26.765 --> 31:29.888

OPPORTUNITY TO KILL ROGER,

31:29.888 --> 31:32.601
BUT NEITHER ONE HAD
A STRONG ENOUGH MOTIVE,

31:32.601 --> 31:35.975
WHICH MAKES THE ACTIONS
OF CELIA THE MAID VERY CURIOUS.

THE INVESTIGATION AT MY PARENTS

31:39.648 --> 31:40.980

AS INTERESTING AS I DO

TO IMPERSONATE A MAID?

IS IT SOME KIND
OF KINKY SEX THING?

32:41.580 --> 32:44.673

A DISINTERESTED PARTY,

32:44.673 --> 32:47.386

WHEN SHE REALIZED

WAS A MISTAKE --

32:52.221 --> 32:54.933
A LOVER WITH WHOM SHE PLOTTED
TO KILL ROGER

40:36.605 --> 40:41.189
CHERISH OUR RELATIONSHIPS?

40:43.822 --> 40:47.405
OUR LIVES ARE RICHER
WHEN WE CHOOSE OPTIMISM.

40:47.405 --> 40:50.529
AND IF WE DO,
WE MIGHT JUST SEE

40:50.529 --> 40:55.373
THAT OUR GLASS IS A LITTLE MORE
FULL THAN WE THOUGHT.
