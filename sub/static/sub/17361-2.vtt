WEBVTT

00:22.188 --> 00:23.928
Morgan:
It'll be dark soon.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.096
Man:
It's not much further.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.390
(horse nickers)

00:26.568 --> 00:28.650
We have people
who can patch her up.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.814
What are you doing?

00:33.992 --> 00:35.857
I'm marking
our way back.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.303
- On your left!
- I've got it.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.463
(horse neighs)

00:58.641 --> 01:00.472
(gunshots)

01:00.643 --> 01:02.224
(walkers growling)

01:07.901 --> 01:11.485
(grunting)

01:11.654 --> 01:14.270
(gunshots)

01:30.423 --> 01:34.007
(walkers growling)

01:34.177 --> 01:36.634
(gunshots)

01:38.014 --> 01:39.515
(grunting)

01:42.685 --> 01:44.676
(gunshots)

01:44.854 --> 01:48.187
(panting)

02:14.175 --> 02:16.131
(growls)

02:16.302 --> 02:19.385
(walkers growling)

02:22.809 --> 02:23.798
(horses neighing)

02:23.977 --> 02:26.844
- (grunts)
- (horse neighs)

02:29.149 --> 02:31.515
(horse neighs)

02:56.217 --> 03:00.927
(growls)

03:05.310 --> 03:07.722
(hoofbeats)

03:11.482 --> 03:12.813
Man: Whoa.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.895
Daniel. Colton.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.061
Good.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.480
We've been looking
for you.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.774
It looks like you found
some people yourself.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.237
(horse snorting)

03:59.989 --> 04:03.322
(birds chirping,
wind chimes clinking)

04:19.008 --> 04:22.341
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

04:41.322 --> 04:44.405
How long
have I been asleep?

04:44.575 --> 04:45.826
(sighs)

04:45.994 --> 04:49.031
Two days,
more or less.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.296
Where are we?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.206
Doctor says
you're healing up,

05:02.385 --> 05:04.216
said it could have been
much worse,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.378
but you had
some luck.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.218
And your pack
with the weapons--

05:09.392 --> 05:11.553
they wanted
to lock them up.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.016
Seeing as they were helping us,
I didn't argue.

05:15.189 --> 05:18.397
It'll be with them
until we're ready to leave.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.025
I figure
that'll be another week,

05:21.195 --> 05:23.060
maybe a little more,

05:23.239 --> 05:25.821
andthen
we can start back to Alexandria.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.234
- What is this place?
- Well, the people here,

05:30.413 --> 05:34.998
they, um-- they call this place
"The Kingdom."

05:40.423 --> 05:43.915
(indistinct conversations)

05:44.093 --> 05:46.300
(bird chirping)

05:46.471 --> 05:48.928
They were helping you...

05:49.098 --> 05:50.258
so I've been
helping them.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.513
(man speaking indistinctly)

05:51.684 --> 05:53.845
Hey.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.601
Yeah.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.564
Did you-- did you tell them
about what happened to me,

06:00.735 --> 06:01.770
about who we are?

06:01.944 --> 06:04.526
Why?
Who are we, Carol?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.233
What did
you tell them?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.821
and they saw
what I did to him.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.405
We got split up.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.911
You found trouble.
I found you.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.447
That is
all he knows.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.240
All who knows?

06:17.418 --> 06:18.624
The man
I'm taking you to see,

06:18.795 --> 06:21.002
the person who's in charge
of this place.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.458
This person
have a name?

06:23.633 --> 06:26.420
(animal bleating)

06:26.594 --> 06:29.131
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.590
He, um--

06:33.142 --> 06:35.007
he's called
"King Ezekiel."

06:35.186 --> 06:36.301
What?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.514
Yeah.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.144
King Ezekiel.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.680
(chuckles)

06:43.152 --> 06:44.608
And, um...

06:46.614 --> 06:47.603
he does
his own thing.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.272
See?

06:51.953 --> 06:55.161
Uh, what does
that mean?

06:55.331 --> 06:56.446
Well...

06:56.624 --> 06:59.991
(breathes sharply)
...here we are.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.285
(tiger growling)

07:07.969 --> 07:09.175
Yeah.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.258
I, uh,
I forgot to say that...

07:14.517 --> 07:16.257
Ezekiel has a tiger.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.720
(roars)

07:22.150 --> 07:26.359
(music playing)

08:02.231 --> 08:05.564
(tiger growling)

08:05.735 --> 08:08.226
Ezekiel:
Shiva, enough.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.066
The fair maiden has been through
a myriad of trials.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.698
- (growling continues)
- They are our guests.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.234
Chill it up,
IIS-II

08:16.412 --> 08:17.913
Chill it up!

08:20.082 --> 08:23.245
Jerry,
you are a faithful steward,

08:23.419 --> 08:26.582
but your words
leave me pitch-kettled.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.247
I understand
your concern, Shiva.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.926
You haven't met Carol.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.674
Nor have I.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.801
But if she is a friend
of Morgan,

08:34.972 --> 08:37.224
we shall consider her
a friend of the realm

08:37.391 --> 08:39.768
until proven otherwise.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.221
She's doing better,

08:41.395 --> 08:43.772
thanks to you
and your people, so...

08:43.940 --> 08:45.180
Indeed.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.646
It pleases me to see you
up and about, Carol.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.901
I am King Ezekiel.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.609
Welcome to the Kingdom.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.445
(Shiva snorts, growling softly)

09:07.296 --> 09:11.084
You have been addressed
by the king, yet you remain silent.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.418
Do I detect skepticism?

09:15.596 --> 09:18.133
Perhaps you think me mad.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.923
Perhaps you see this place
as nothing more than a mirage.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.936
So... tell me...

09:25.106 --> 09:27.848
what do you think
of The Kingdom, Carol?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.601
What do you think
of the king?

09:37.702 --> 09:41.115
I... think
you're amazing.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.995
It's amazing.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.326
And your Sheba--

09:45.501 --> 09:47.787
It's, uh, "Shiva."

09:47.962 --> 09:50.874
Shiva.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.037
Amazing.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.834
I would be speechless
if I wasn't already speaking.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.128
I don't know
what the hell's going on

09:58.306 --> 09:59.671
in the most wonderful way.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.510
(both chuckle)

10:01.684 --> 10:05.472
As Morgan is aware, I encourage
those who find respite here

10:05.646 --> 10:07.352
to enjoy
the fruits of our grandeur

10:07.523 --> 10:12.142
for as long as they like,
so long as they contribute.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.107
Drink from the well,
replenish the well...

10:15.281 --> 10:17.112
once you've healed,
of course.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.318
Of course.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.528
Of course.
All about the well.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.910
Well-said.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.492
Jerry...

10:25.666 --> 10:27.372
Ah, where are
my manners?

10:27.543 --> 10:29.784
(snaps fingers)

10:29.962 --> 10:30.951
Please, partake.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.669
We have magnificent apples,
nectarines, pomegranates--

10:35.843 --> 10:38.255
all grown right here
inside the kingdom.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.421
It's fruit time.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.885
I-I couldn't.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.972
Oh, come, now.
At least take a pomegranate.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.229
You know, I always found them
too much trouble.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.515
Sweet fruit
surrounded by bitter--

10:52.693 --> 10:54.024
they're something
of a contradiction,

10:54.195 --> 10:56.686
but heaven for the effort.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.071
You park some chocolate in front
of me and watch it go bye-bye,

10:59.241 --> 11:02.278
but pomegranates,
just not for me, thanks.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.195
Well, if there's anything
you want or need--

11:05.373 --> 11:07.614
if you enjoy music,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.909
we have a guitarist whose talent
brings tears to the eye,

11:11.087 --> 11:12.247
and we have
a small choir.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.581
Thank you.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.589
All I need
is some more rest...

11:16.759 --> 11:17.919
and maybe
a hairbrush.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.254
(chuckles)

11:19.428 --> 11:21.885
No one told me
I'd be meeting royalty.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.465
Anyway...

11:25.643 --> 11:27.975
uh, Your Majesty--

11:28.145 --> 11:30.431
I should call you
"Your Majesty," right?

11:30.606 --> 11:31.891
You can.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.899
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.775
It's a pleasure.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.062
The pleasure is mine, Carol.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.776
Be well.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.573
(Shiva growls)

11:53.963 --> 11:55.203
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.623
Look, I know.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.166
You're shitting me,
right?

12:00.344 --> 12:01.629
Now, it's--
it's a lot.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.089
He is, um...

12:03.264 --> 12:05.095
I don't know.
lt-- it--

12:05.266 --> 12:06.722
Stop it.
Stop this.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.803
This place
is a damn circus,

12:08.978 --> 12:10.309
all of it.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.470
Th-these people,
this is make-believe.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.058
It's playtime.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.064
And you're just...

12:16.235 --> 12:17.520
(laughs)

12:17.695 --> 12:19.060
I can't do this.
I can't be here.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.273
Look, Carol,
these people found--

12:20.448 --> 12:22.655
No, I can't, Morgan.
I won't.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.611
I'll wait.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.286
And when you're not there
to stop me,

12:26.454 --> 12:28.536
when nobody else is,
I'll go.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.821
You know
I can't let you.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.330
No. |'||--

12:31.500 --> 12:33.161
You'll what?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.711
Tie me up
like that wolf?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.289
Is that it?

12:37.882 --> 12:41.090
It isn't
up to you.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.670
It wasn't before
in the basement,

12:42.845 --> 12:45.211
it wasn't at the library,
and it isn't now.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.890
I don't give a shit

12:47.057 --> 12:48.513
if you think
you've found the secret to life.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.799
- |--
- No, I don't. I don't.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.093
I don't, and I haven't.
And I know what I've started.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.651
But I won't let you die
out there.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.279
That's what
I won't do.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.498
It doesn't matter
what you do.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.708
(engine starts)

13:29.809 --> 13:31.925
(gate thuds)

13:37.066 --> 13:40.433
(snorting, growling)

13:40.611 --> 13:41.942
Morgan:
Where we going?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.898
- Ezekiel: Hunting.
- Hunting what?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.655
What was once captive
to the farm

13:46.826 --> 13:48.942
now runs free
in the city.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.245
(snorting)
Here!

13:50.412 --> 13:51.663
- Come on!
- Man: Come on!

13:51.831 --> 13:52.991
- Come on!
- Come on! Whoo!

13:53.165 --> 13:54.405
- Come on!
- Come on!

13:54.583 --> 13:56.414
- Turn! Turn!
- Whoo, whoo! Come on!

13:56.585 --> 13:57.916
- Hunting!
- Go now! Go now!

13:58.087 --> 13:59.167
- Go!
- Come on!

13:59.338 --> 14:00.327
- Go now! Go now!
- Come on!

14:00.506 --> 14:01.495
(walker growling)

14:01.674 --> 14:03.835
Go now! Go now! Go!
Come on!

14:04.009 --> 14:06.591
_( _ - Go!
pig squeals)

14:06.762 --> 14:08.343
Well-done,
Richard.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.972
It's just
what we needed.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.633
(growling continues)

14:14.812 --> 14:17.975
Why the Walker?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.811
We're herding them in.
Why do you need bait?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.978
Because I want their bellies
full of rot.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.147
That's why.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.658
(pigs squealing)

14:34.206 --> 14:37.118
You shoot a machine gun
in the woods, and nothing.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.999
You cough in the city, and...

14:39.169 --> 14:40.420
(walkers growling)

14:41.755 --> 14:43.666
Ezekiel:
Diane, retrieve the truck.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.456
We'll take our leave.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.886
(growling continues)

14:53.392 --> 14:54.757
Ben...

14:54.935 --> 14:57.642
you're up.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.519
Use the machete.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.308
Just as you and he
have practiced.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.227
Yeah.
Like we practiced.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.191
(breathes deeply)

15:08.365 --> 15:09.525
(grunting)

15:09.700 --> 15:11.611
(growling)

15:18.584 --> 15:21.826
(sighs)

15:25.883 --> 15:27.794
(growling stops)

15:31.430 --> 15:33.170
Do not be troubled,
Benjamin.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.885
Next time.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.512
No one back home
needs to know about this.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.191
Morgan:
You mean the pigs--

15:43.359 --> 15:45.270
that they're eating
the dead?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.523
Any of it.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.985
(truck engine running)

15:55.120 --> 15:57.372
(walker growling)

15:57.539 --> 15:58.574
- (grunts)
- (walker thuds)

15:58.749 --> 16:00.489
(walkers growling)

16:05.798 --> 16:08.039
May we one day cease you all
from this curse!

16:08.217 --> 16:10.424
Till then, know that
we live on in your place...

16:10.594 --> 16:14.052
- (truck door closes)
- ...full, festive, faithful, and free.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.384
Only halfway free.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.677
(truck doors closing)

16:36.745 --> 16:38.827
Where are they going?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.738
Somewhere else.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.553
(gate creaks)

17:00.269 --> 17:04.763
(gate creaks, thuds)

17:10.946 --> 17:12.811
Your skill
with the staff...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.779
...how did you come to acquire
that skill?

17:18.954 --> 17:22.162
It was a cheesemaker,
a friend.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.036
(chuckles)

17:25.210 --> 17:28.623
I imagine your comrade would be
very proud of you this day.

17:28.797 --> 17:29.832
(chuckles)

17:30.007 --> 17:32.373
For saving Ben
in a single blow.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.472
There's a saying--

17:37.639 --> 17:41.052
the pessimist looks down
and hits his head.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.057
The optimist looks up...

17:43.228 --> 17:45.389
andloses
his footing.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.354
The realist
looks forward

17:48.525 --> 17:51.187
and adjusts his path
accordingly.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.610
I believe young Benjamin's path
is in need of adjustment.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.157
Would you train him,
as your friend trained you?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.662
I don't...

18:03.832 --> 18:04.992
I don't know
that I'm the--

18:05.167 --> 18:06.247
Benjamin
has shown aptitude

18:06.418 --> 18:08.704
with neither blades
nor munitions.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.666
Perhaps his failings lie
in the weapons...

18:11.840 --> 18:14.172
perhaps
it's the teacher...

18:15.260 --> 18:16.511
and perhaps it's both.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.179
Hey, look,
you know...

18:18.347 --> 18:21.680
the man I shot
to save Carol--

18:21.850 --> 18:23.761
the stick
couldn't have saved her.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.062
Has it saved you?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.356
Yeah.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.694
Young Benjamin will become
an important member of my court.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.859
lneed
the boy to...

18:43.122 --> 18:44.453
I need him to live.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.960
Please.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.294
Okay.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.261
(laughs)

18:58.428 --> 19:01.920
The Kingdom is favored
by your presence once more!

19:02.099 --> 19:04.055
(choir vocalizing)

19:10.482 --> 19:15.727
Man: J‘ Well, it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe J‘

19:17.906 --> 19:22.570
J‘ If'n you don't know by now J‘

19:22.744 --> 19:27.579
J‘ And it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe J‘

19:29.918 --> 19:31.954
J‘ It'll never do somehow... .l‘

19:32.129 --> 19:34.495
(vocalizing continues)

19:34.673 --> 19:40.919
J‘ When your rooster crows
at the break of dawn J‘

19:41.096 --> 19:46.466
J‘ Look out your window,
and I'll be gone J“

19:46.643 --> 19:52.138
J‘ You're the reason
I'm a-traveling on J‘

19:52.316 --> 19:57.481
J‘ Don't think twice,
it's all right J‘

19:57.654 --> 20:02.148
.l‘ Oh, don't think twice .l‘

20:02.326 --> 20:07.366
J‘ It's all right... .l‘

20:07.539 --> 20:09.120
(grunting)

20:09.291 --> 20:13.625
J‘ And it ain't no use
in turning on your light, babe J‘

20:13.795 --> 20:15.956
J‘ No turning on J‘

20:16.131 --> 20:17.792
J‘ The light I never knowed... J‘

20:17.966 --> 20:20.958
- That was too fast, right?
- No, no, I can keep up.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.467
- No, no.
- J‘ And it ain't no use J“

20:22.638 --> 20:25.175
- J‘ In turning on your light, babe... J‘
- It's too fast.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.385
J‘ It's turning on your light J‘

20:27.559 --> 20:32.394
J‘ I'm on the dark side
of the road J“

20:32.564 --> 20:38.810
J‘ Well, I wish there was
somethin' you would do or say J‘

20:38.987 --> 20:44.402
J‘ To try and make me
change my mind and stay J‘

20:44.576 --> 20:49.286
J‘ But we never did
too much talking, anyway J‘

20:50.999 --> 20:53.160
J‘ But don't think twice,
it's all right... J‘

20:53.335 --> 20:54.666
- Over the head?
- Over the head.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.087
(breathing sharply)

20:56.255 --> 20:57.665
There.
And again.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.090
Swing it back
and up.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.216
J‘ Don't think twice,
it's all right... J‘

21:02.386 --> 21:05.844
(breathing sharply)

21:08.016 --> 21:10.678
J‘ Well, it ain't no use
in calling out my name, gal... J‘

21:10.852 --> 21:14.015
Carol: I mean, it was flavor
on top of flavor.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.225
- It was like a goddamn dream.
- J“ Like you never done before... J‘

21:16.400 --> 21:18.356
I mean...
(chuckles)

21:18.527 --> 21:20.734
...breakfast cobbler?
That's...

21:20.904 --> 21:22.440
J‘ And it ain't no use
in calling out my name, gal... J‘

21:22.614 --> 21:24.229
We were eating possum
out there.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.444
- J‘ Don't think twice... J‘
- Now, I like the lunch cobbler.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.824
J‘ I can't hear you anymore... J‘

21:27.995 --> 21:30.702
There's lunch cobbler?

21:30.872 --> 21:32.078
(chucang)
We have cobbler at every meal.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.534
J‘ So long honey, baby... J‘

21:33.709 --> 21:36.075
(scoffs)
Oh!

21:38.422 --> 21:39.537
- (laughs)
- J‘ Where I'm bound, I can't tell... J‘

21:39.715 --> 21:41.046
I'm just so...

21:41.216 --> 21:43.707
Ijust-- I can't.

21:43.885 --> 21:44.874
Oh, God!
(laughs)

21:45.053 --> 21:46.714
- J‘ "Goodbye" is too good a word, babe J‘
- Oh, geez.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.879
Mnh.
(sniffles)

21:49.057 --> 21:50.467
Do you have
any tissues?

21:50.642 --> 21:53.054
- J‘ So I'll just say, "fare thee well" J‘
- Yeah, one second.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.264
(animal snorts)

21:55.439 --> 22:02.106
J‘ I ain't saying
you treated me unkind J‘

22:02.279 --> 22:06.067
J‘ You could have done better,
but I don't mind... .l‘

22:06.241 --> 22:07.606
(breathing sharply)

22:07.784 --> 22:13.905
J‘ You just kind of wasted
my precious time J‘

22:14.082 --> 22:17.290
J‘ But don't think twice,
it's all right... J‘

22:17.461 --> 22:18.541
(grunts)

22:18.712 --> 22:21.579
Hey,
what's the book?

22:21.757 --> 22:25.295
It's, uh--
It's philosophy.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.927
- You know, we should really get back--
- You mind if! borrow it?

22:29.097 --> 22:32.510
I've just read
every book in this place...

22:32.684 --> 22:34.265
twice...

22:34.436 --> 22:36.768
including an air-conditioning
repair textbook.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.098
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles)

22:38.273 --> 22:40.104
Just so you know,
the number-one problem

22:40.275 --> 22:43.312
with an HVAC system
isn't refrigerant leaks.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.772
Yeah.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.322
Won't spoil that one
for you.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.900
(chuckles)

22:48.950 --> 22:50.531
Please?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.491
Here.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.786
(chuckles)

22:58.960 --> 23:01.337
Ezekiel: Gentlemen...

23:01.505 --> 23:04.042
come with us,
both of you.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.800
We have matters of import
to attend to.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.460
Bring your gun,
Morgan.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.053
(wind rushing)

23:18.230 --> 23:19.686
Ezekiel: The swine
are slaughtered

23:19.856 --> 23:22.233
far from
The Kingdom...

23:22.401 --> 23:26.144
lest their screams carry in
the wind and invite questions.

23:26.321 --> 23:31.236
What we are doing here is
a secret I keep from my people.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.153
Some see secrets
as a privilege of ruling.

23:35.330 --> 23:39.994
They are burdens,
not part of the reward.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.328
They are the cost.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.539
(brakes squeal, engine rumbling)

23:47.843 --> 23:51.006
(engine shuts off)

23:51.179 --> 23:54.512
(vehicle doors closing)

24:03.191 --> 24:05.898
Gavin: Here, Iwas worried
we were early.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.525
Our arrangement

24:07.696 --> 24:10.438
is something I consider
with the utmost seriousness.

24:13.994 --> 24:18.408
Yes, indeedy, you do,
and you will.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.958
(music playing)

24:23.128 --> 24:25.870
(sighs)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.881
I count 8--
that's good.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.042
They look bigger than last time.
That's good, too.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.426
They were well-fed.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.178
I made sure of it.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.760
We appreciate
your hospitality.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.892
Lucky for us,
we brought two trucks.

24:41.062 --> 24:45.226
How about you, uh,
help us load 'em up?

24:48.612 --> 24:50.102
They're part
of another group.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.692
- They call themselves--
- I know who they are.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.250
(pig thuds, truck gate closes)

25:07.839 --> 25:12.253
Hey, asshole,
how about a smile?

25:12.427 --> 25:15.919
This--
this is nothing.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.088
We've been
letting you off easy.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.604
You sure you don't
have that backwards, kid?

25:25.774 --> 25:28.106
(chuckles)

25:28.276 --> 25:29.686
Yeah.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.943
I'm sure.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.853
(grunts)

25:36.451 --> 25:37.816
(grunting)

25:37.994 --> 25:39.109
(guns cock)

25:39.287 --> 25:41.448
Ezekiel:
Cease this.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.159
(both grunting)

25:48.630 --> 25:50.621
(blows landing)

25:50.799 --> 25:53.882
Lower your weapons.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.877
Richard...

25:57.055 --> 25:58.295
let him go.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.133
(coughs)

26:03.311 --> 26:06.724
This is not what we do.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.515
Free shots?

26:10.694 --> 26:12.230
Oh, I love
this shit.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.153
(grunts)

26:15.323 --> 26:18.315
Gavin,
tell your man to stop.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.449
- (grunts)
- Gavin!

26:20.620 --> 26:24.363
Jared! Jared!
The man said stop!

26:25.500 --> 26:26.831
And he's been good to us.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.288
We've taken up
more than enough of his time.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.917
(whistles)

26:45.270 --> 26:48.558
Richard,
we will discuss this.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.848
Come on.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.516
(breathing heavily)

26:52.694 --> 26:54.025
Gavin: Same time next week,
Ezekiel, all right?

26:54.195 --> 26:58.188
It's produce week,
so... produce.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.618
You got the list--
not one bit less.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.329
(vehicle door closes)

27:03.496 --> 27:07.284
Otherwise... you know...

27:07.459 --> 27:08.869
he's gonna
have to go first.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.581
(engine starts)

27:14.132 --> 27:17.374
(imitating pig squealing)

27:21.097 --> 27:24.385
You've encountered them
before?

27:24.559 --> 27:25.799
Their group?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.217
Yeah.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.436
The man you killed
to save Carol--

27:30.607 --> 27:33.269
he was one of them,
as well?

27:33.443 --> 27:36.560
He was, yeah.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.229
(sighs)

27:39.407 --> 27:41.864
Is that
why you wanted me here?

27:43.578 --> 27:45.660
Because I could do it again
if I had to?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.912
No, Morgan.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.620
Quite the opposite,
in fact.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.262
(indistinct conversations)

28:09.938 --> 28:11.803
Benjamin: Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.937
Where you going,
hmm?

28:14.109 --> 28:15.770
It's movie night tonight.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.104
I want to get a good seat.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.985
Right, but you were gonna
clean your plate, though, first.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.191
(sighs)

28:21.366 --> 28:24.574
Come on.
That was the deal, Dutch.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.451
- Yeah.
- (crunching)

28:27.622 --> 28:29.078
Wow.
Good one, smart guy.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.615
All right, well,
just be in bed by 10:00,

28:31.793 --> 28:33.033
not a minute later.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.291
But I can read?

28:34.462 --> 28:35.872
Yes,
you can read.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.332
All right.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.123
(conversations continue)

28:40.301 --> 28:41.882
(both chuckle)

28:42.053 --> 28:43.884
He's a good kid.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.296
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.

28:47.809 --> 28:48.798
(door closes)

28:48.977 --> 28:50.808
I only kind of know
what I'm doing raising him.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.563
Ezekiel's been
a big help.

28:55.650 --> 28:56.981
You seem close...

28:57.152 --> 28:59.393
you and the king.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.153
Yeah, he was, uh,
pretty tight with my dad.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.362
My father
was a good fighter.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.369
One of the best
in The Kingdom.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.655
How'd it happen?

29:15.086 --> 29:17.042
It was about a year ago.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.547
Ezekiel sent his detachment out
to clear out a building.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.673
There was too many wasted
and not enough backup.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.174
Eight men
didn't make it out.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.729
My father
was one of 'em.

29:35.899 --> 29:40.518
But E-Ezekiel--
he's a lot more careful now.

29:40.695 --> 29:44.688
He told me that it,
uh, well...

29:46.201 --> 29:49.864
He, uh, told me he was keeping
his deal with that group quiet

29:50.038 --> 29:52.120
'cause he thinks
the people would want to fight.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.288
He says that even if we did,
we wouldn't win--

29:57.462 --> 30:00.078
at least,
not without losing people...

30:00.256 --> 30:01.917
maybe a lot of 'em.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.797
And you think
he's right...

30:05.428 --> 30:06.964
that we
shouldn't fight?

30:07.138 --> 30:08.378
I don't know.

30:08.556 --> 30:09.762
I mean...

30:09.933 --> 30:11.548
I don't know
if I know enough to know.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.932
(chuckles)

30:14.604 --> 30:16.720
Maybe you do.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.556
Hey, um...

30:19.734 --> 30:22.897
there was an inscription
in the book.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.484
It was handwritten--
about not killing.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.944
- Is it yours?
- It's not, no.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.779
'Cause I also noticed

30:30.954 --> 30:33.821
you only put vegetables
on your plate during dinner.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.375
And, I mean,
you're teaching me aikido,

30:36.543 --> 30:38.124
and if aikido
means not to kill,

30:38.294 --> 30:39.283
then that means
that you're--

30:39.462 --> 30:40.918
It's not about
what I think.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.420
People can--

30:42.590 --> 30:45.673
they can try and set you
in the right direction,

30:45.844 --> 30:48.961
but they can't
show you the way.

30:49.138 --> 30:53.802
You know, you got to find that
for yourself, and...

30:53.977 --> 30:56.434
I thought I had it.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.935
Idid.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.483
But I'm-- I'm just
fumbling through.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.822
Sometimes,
we change our minds.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.197
Well, hey, do you want
to catch movie night?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.455
I can't.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.457
I, uh...

31:20.628 --> 31:23.210
I got to
talk to Carol.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.996
But thank you.

31:26.301 --> 31:31.170
(clinking)

32:12.972 --> 32:14.963
(insects chirping)

32:19.687 --> 32:22.349
(animal howls in distance)

32:25.693 --> 32:27.354
Ezekiel:
By all means, fair maiden.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.779
Have one.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.950
This enclosure
was built

32:36.120 --> 32:38.907
for the purpose
of common recreation and study.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.542
I had it repurposed into
a garden worthy of our splendor.

32:43.711 --> 32:47.545
I dare say it's my favorite
place in the entire Kingdom.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.254
It pleases me that you've
seen it with your own eyes

32:52.428 --> 32:55.795
before choosing
to leave us so suddenly.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.885
Geez, yeah, I...

33:00.228 --> 33:01.388
I'm real sorry
about this.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.644
Um,
it's just...

33:03.815 --> 33:06.557
What good am I here?

33:08.152 --> 33:12.145
Jerry...
would you excuse us?

33:12.323 --> 33:13.483
(inhales deeply)

33:13.658 --> 33:15.569
If you need me,
holler.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.734
lkeep
in hollering range.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.584
Ezekiel: Ifl hadn't
happened upon you right now--

33:28.131 --> 33:30.338
what's that saying?

33:35.930 --> 33:39.673
Never bullshit
a bullshitter.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.842
Have I got that right?

33:42.020 --> 33:45.763
The sweet-and-innocent act
you've been doing--

33:45.940 --> 33:47.555
it's quite clever.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.188
Worked on me.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.774
Blend in,
get people to trust you,

33:53.948 --> 33:55.449
acquire what you need
from them,

33:55.616 --> 34:00.201
and then you're gone,
as if you were never there.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.704
The guns you brought here
in your pack--

34:03.875 --> 34:05.957
they belong
to Saviors.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.039
What do you know
about the Saviors?

34:09.213 --> 34:12.125
More than I care to,
unfortunately.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.757
They nearly
extinguished you.

34:14.927 --> 34:19.011
But you did more than put up
a fight, Carol-- you won.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.385
(chuckles)

34:22.560 --> 34:24.972
By ending up here?

34:26.981 --> 34:29.063
That's funny
to you?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.485
(sighs)

34:31.652 --> 34:35.236
You're a joke.
This place is.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.363
Out there--
Out there, it's real.

34:41.537 --> 34:44.495
I've been to places where
I thought I wouldn't have to--

34:44.665 --> 34:46.075
where I could just be.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.160
You're selling these people
a fairy tale.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.999
Maybe they need
the fairy tale.

34:52.173 --> 34:55.040
Maybe the contradiction
is the point.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.628
And ruling over people

34:56.803 --> 34:59.761
and having your ass kissed
by everyone's just a perk?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.846
May I?

35:26.541 --> 35:28.873
People want
someone to follow.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.373
It's human nature.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.382
They want someone
to make 'em feel safe.

35:37.552 --> 35:41.090
And people who feel safe
are less dangerous...

35:41.264 --> 35:43.550
more productive.

35:43.724 --> 35:49.094
They see a dude
with a tiger, shoot,

35:49.272 --> 35:53.891
they start tellin' stories
about finding it in the wild,

35:54.068 --> 35:58.437
wrestling it into submission,
turning it into his pet.

35:58.614 --> 36:01.651
They make the guy
larger than life,

36:01.826 --> 36:03.316
a hero.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.281
And who am I
to burst their bubble?

36:06.455 --> 36:10.698
Next thing you know,
they treat me like royalty.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.411
They wanted--

36:14.589 --> 36:19.709
they needed someone to follow,
s-so |-- I acted the part.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.591
| faked it
till I made it.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.730
I was a zookeeper.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.141
Shiva, she fell into

36:37.320 --> 36:40.278
one of the concrete moats
in her exhibit.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.315
It was empty,
the vets were on their way,

36:43.492 --> 36:45.619
but her leg
was ripped open.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.526
She was gonna bleed out.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.827
The sound she made.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.793
She was in
so much pain.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.628
I knew the risk.

37:01.802 --> 37:04.544
I had to try.

37:04.722 --> 37:08.306
And I got my shirt up
around her leg...

37:09.477 --> 37:11.388
saved her life.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.312
After that,
she never showed

37:15.483 --> 37:17.769
so much as a tooth
in my direction.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.564
Keeping a tiger
isn't practical, I know.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.108
She eats
as much as 10 people.

37:27.286 --> 37:29.402
She could yank the chain
out of my hand--

37:29.580 --> 37:31.821
hell, she could
yank my arm right off.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.834
But she hasn't.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.915
She won't.

37:41.842 --> 37:44.504
I lost a lot,
just like everybody else.

37:46.764 --> 37:50.131
When it all started to end,
I found myself back at the zoo.

37:51.394 --> 37:56.013
Shiva was
one of the last animals left.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.102
She was trapped...

38:00.111 --> 38:01.601
hungry, alone.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.197
Like me.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.451
She was the last thing left
in this world that I loved.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.243
She protected me.

38:15.418 --> 38:20.378
She got me here,
made me larger than life.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.379
And I made
this place.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.045
I used to act
in community theater,

38:29.557 --> 38:31.889
played a few kings
in my day...

38:32.059 --> 38:33.390
(chuckles)

38:33.561 --> 38:35.893
Arthur, Macbeth...

38:36.063 --> 38:37.803
Martin Luther.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.392
(chuckles)

38:39.567 --> 38:42.604
My name really is Ezekiel,
though.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.064
(sighs)

38:45.239 --> 38:47.446
That's 100% real.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.788
Cards on the table.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.449
Nothing up my sleeve.

38:58.627 --> 39:02.085
I'd appreciate you
keep this between us, though,

39:02.256 --> 39:03.871
for them.

39:05.926 --> 39:08.133
And, yeah,
a little bit for me.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.591
(sniffles)
I don't care.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.519
You do
what you want.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.306
Ijust want
to go.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.271
Go where?

39:26.697 --> 39:28.483
Carol.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.361
Away.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.947
I'm sorry.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.537
For what?

39:42.713 --> 39:46.171
For whatever bad
you've been through.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.708
There's so much of it
out there now, you know?

39:50.721 --> 39:52.131
(sighs)

39:54.141 --> 39:55.927
Too much.

39:57.978 --> 40:01.391
Out there,
it feels like it's all bad,

40:01.565 --> 40:04.352
especially when
you're alone.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.892
(sighs)

40:06.070 --> 40:08.732
The thing is,
though...

40:10.533 --> 40:12.740
it's not all bad.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.740
It can't be.
It isn't.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.327
Life isn't.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.832
Where there's life,

40:22.002 --> 40:27.713
there's hope, heroism,
grace, and love.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.176
Where there's life,
there's life.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.258
I hope that's not
what you're walking away from.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.596
So what if I am?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.556
Maybe you don't
have to.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.595
I made
my own world here.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.184
I found a way
to deal with the bad

40:45.359 --> 40:47.190
by going a little overboard
with all the good.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.601
Ijust...

40:49.947 --> 40:52.029
embraced
the contradiction.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.283
Maybe you could, too,
in your own way.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.697
Like, maybe you could go
and... not go.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.457
Yeah, I-I sound like
a crazy person.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.707
I get it.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.619
You know,
maybe I am.

41:06.797 --> 41:10.210
But I think
I can help...

41:10.384 --> 41:12.340
if you let me.

41:14.346 --> 41:16.598
Why do you care?

41:18.976 --> 41:22.594
'Cause it makes me
feel good.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.181
I'll get your stuff together,

41:26.358 --> 41:27.643
find somebody I trust
to meet you at the gate,

41:27.818 --> 41:30.730
so you can go
and-- and not go.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.738
We'll see
if I'm on to something

41:33.908 --> 41:36.820
or if it's just
more bullshit.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.032
What do you say?

42:00.184 --> 42:03.472
You're sure this is
what you want, right?

42:03.646 --> 42:05.056
lam.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.060
It's up to you.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.065
It should have always
been up to you.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.609
Whoa.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.495
Whoa.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.294
Okay?

42:35.469 --> 42:38.302
(horse whinnies)

42:38.472 --> 42:40.713
(snorts)

42:40.891 --> 42:43.132
Got it.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.688
(sighs)
Stay there.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.311
It's good we're here.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.398
- (snorts)
- How's that?

42:51.569 --> 42:53.309
10 more minutes,
and I might start to regret

42:53.487 --> 42:56.695
all the times
I tried to shoot and stab you.

43:01.203 --> 43:04.115
I think you're my favorite
person I ever knocked out.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.535
Definitely
top two or three.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.325
(chuckles)

43:12.715 --> 43:15.172
Take care
of yourself.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.924
I will.
Do you promise?

43:18.095 --> 43:21.508
Always watching,
always ready, remember?

43:21.682 --> 43:24.845
I do.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.519
Okay.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.915
Thank you.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.166
(lock clanking)

44:00.763 --> 44:02.048
Whoa.

44:02.222 --> 44:05.055
(gate creaking)

44:05.225 --> 44:09.093
(sighs)

44:09.271 --> 44:11.432
(gate closes)

44:28.499 --> 44:29.989
(walker growls)

44:30.167 --> 44:32.453
(growling)

44:41.595 --> 44:43.631
(growling stops, walker thuds)

44:56.443 --> 44:58.479
(knock on door)

45:05.619 --> 45:09.157
(Shiva growls)

45:16.004 --> 45:19.667
You really got to try
one of these.
