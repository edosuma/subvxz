00:02.770 --> 00:05.762
***

00:23.220 --> 00:25.347
- You're awake.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.381
- And you're...
leaving already.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.320
- I have to be
in court in 20 minutes.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.090
- I can work
with 20 minutes.

00:32.130 --> 00:35.054
- I need to be... dressed.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.567
- It was fun last night.
- Last night was fun.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.364
Tuesday was pretty good too.
Are we still on for tonight?

00:43.410 --> 00:46.777
- Absolutely.
I was thinking...

00:46.810 --> 00:51.349
maybe we could go out tonight.
Why?

00:51.380 --> 00:54.577
- I don't know, maybe have
our first "real date".

00:54.620 --> 00:57.839
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

00:57.890 --> 01:00.484
- No! Why would there be
a problem with that?

01:00.520 --> 01:03.751
- I don't know!

01:03.790 --> 01:07.157
- Ah... It's Angie.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.725
Apparently we snagged a new
case. I better get going too.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.569
- You haven't told her
about us yet, have you?

01:16.610 --> 01:19.829
Yeah, that, uh, could be

01:19.880 --> 01:22.804
an issue, and Angie's got
a thing about dating clients.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.877
- But I'm a former client.
- And a potential future client.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.414
- OK. But you're still gonna
tell her about us, aren't you?

01:31.450 --> 01:34.419
- Yes.
- As in, today.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.122
- Absolutely.
- Great.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.549
***

01:44.830 --> 01:47.560
- If I'd known you were gonna be
so late, I would've taken a cab.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.364
What kept you?
- Oh, I got a phone call...

01:50.410 --> 01:53.402
from my dentist. Guy could talk
for hours about bicuspids.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.704
So what's the new case?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.402
- Maz left me a message.
Some walk-in clinic

01:58.450 --> 02:00.714
from the Danforth Village
got broken into last night.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.379
He asked if we could help out.
- He wants our help on a
B&E? That's weird.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.479
- It is weird. So is the fact

02:06.520 --> 02:08.488
that you smell
like hazelnut coffee.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.681
- I just wanted to try
something different.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.622
- You're wearing the
same shirt as yesterday.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.890
_ : You're
dating someone!

02:16.930 --> 02:19.490
No!
- And keeping it a secret.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.893
Now that's interesting.
Why all the mystery?

02:20.940 --> 02:24.239
- And you got quite an
imagination. Look, there's Maz.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.238
This must be the place!

02:31.310 --> 02:34.871
- Hey good, you're here! Uh...

02:34.920 --> 02:37.411
let's go inside. Yeah.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.749
You know what? Let's actually...
stay out here. Yeah.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.252
Just handing over a big juicy
case to my best bud, as always.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.790
How 'you doing, Jake?
- Maz.

02:47.830 --> 02:50.526
- Why aren't you
investigating it?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.788
- Got a couple of statements,
but, uh, the department's

02:52.840 --> 02:54.796
not making B&E's a really
high priority these days.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.638
Besides, I think the doctor that
runs this place would really

02:57.670 --> 03:01.333
appreciate your involvement.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.701
- He's back, Ange.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.378
In the flesh.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.688
- Oh, Maz, you didn't.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.711
What flesh?
- Look, just understand

03:12.760 --> 03:15.320
that I did this for your own
good, OK? I mean, what are

03:15.360 --> 03:18.352
the odds, really I mean,
you're gonna thank me for this,

03:18.390 --> 03:20.756
one day. I promise.
Maybe. Hopefully.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.428
***

03:27.900 --> 03:29.709
- Hi, Ken.

03:37.410 --> 03:40.516
- That is the one
and only Dr. Ken Graham.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.814
Also known as
the one that got away.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.718
***

03:46.760 --> 03:50.457
- ** I see you and you see me

03:50.490 --> 03:54.551

when you're makin' a scene *

03:54.600 --> 03:58.388
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:58.430 --> 04:00.569
* What my head overlooks

04:00.600 --> 04:04.309

04:15.580 --> 04:17.548

watching you, watching you *

04:17.590 --> 04:19.911
* Watching you *

04:21.820 --> 04:23.822
***

04:32.840 --> 04:35.400
- Look at this place.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.567
It was fine last night
when I left.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.329
- Must be difficult
to take in.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.904
- Since I got back, I've
been working the nightshift

04:41.940 --> 04:44.408
in the ER. I usually
get here by eight but --

04:44.450 --> 04:46.748
- Since you got back
from where, vacation?

04:46.780 --> 04:48.771
- For the last five years,
I've been working with an NGO,

04:48.820 --> 04:51.414
treating orphans in the
Nigerian jungle. Malaria,

04:51.450 --> 04:53.418
HIV, that
sort of thing.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.655
It's a tragedy
of epic proportions.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.988
- Huh.
- I got back last month

04:58.030 --> 05:00.328
and I decided to open
this place. Free clinic

05:00.360 --> 05:02.567
serving the neighbourhood.
We treat new immigrants,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.091
refugees mostly.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.896
- And you work in the ER.
- Only five nights a week.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.034
- Huh! Same old Ken.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.573
- Uh, I'm Matt Shade,
by the way.

05:14.610 --> 05:17.977
- Ken, this is my partner.
- Matt Shade--

05:18.010 --> 05:20.672
- Yeah, as in
"The Shadow"?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.712
I used to play
professional hockey.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.615
- Sorry, I never really
made time for sports,

05:25.650 --> 05:27.618
what with med school and
reSIdency and volunteering...

05:27.660 --> 05:30.356
- Right.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.756
- So, what were the thieves
after, do you think?

05:32.800 --> 05:36.019
Um, all of the computers
are here... Drugs, maybe?

05:36.060 --> 05:38.528
- They were disappointed if they
were. Like the sign up front

05:38.570 --> 05:40.697
says, we don't keep
any drugs on the premises.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.560
- Is there somebody else
that might have a better idea

05:42.610 --> 05:44.566
of what's missing?
- My colleague, Sayid

05:44.610 --> 05:46.578
He always
arrives first.

05:46.610 --> 05:49.408
- So you don't
watch hockey at all?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.941
Oh, hey! Lemme give you a hand.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.414
- I've got it.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.611
OK.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.141
Sayid, this is
Angie Everett. She's...

05:59.190 --> 06:02.523
ah... an old friend.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.926
- It's nice to meet you.
- Angie's a private investigator

06:04.960 --> 06:06.894
and this is
her partner...

06:06.930 --> 06:08.625
- Matt Shade.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.696
The clinic's gonna
be closed for days.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.698
- We'll get it up and
running sooner than that.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.435
- Patients are going to be
scared to come back now.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.165
- We'll figure it out.
We always do.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.964
- This cabinet's been jimmied
open. What was in here?

06:19.010 --> 06:20.898
- Some... gauze, bandages...
Nothing really.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.909
The thieves
pretty much cleaned it out.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.770
- There may have been
some petty cash in there.

06:25.810 --> 06:28.608
- It's a... press-on nail.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.743
- It's not from
anyone who works here.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.758
- Sayid, did you see anybody
when you got here this morning?

06:32.790 --> 06:35.714
- I saw the smashed window
and I called the police.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.024
No, first the spray
paint and now this.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.096
Our patients don't deserve this.
They've been through enough.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.928
- Wait, are you saying
the graffiti out front

06:42.970 --> 06:45.188
was a separate incident?
- Yeah. About a week ago.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.892
We got the worst of it off.
- The words were far
from welcoming.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.908
- Can you guys think
of anyone who's unhappy

06:49.940 --> 06:51.737
about the clinic being here?

06:54.780 --> 06:56.771
- The caf owner
across the street.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.607
He blames the clinic
for attracting

06:58.650 --> 07:00.971
the "wrong kind" of people.
- OK, we'll check it out.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.989
- Angie, you really...
don't have to take this on.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.045
- No, I insist.
It's on us.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.978
We're going to figure out
who's doing all this

07:08.020 --> 07:11.683
and put a stop to it.
- Same old Angie.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.721
***

07:16.530 --> 07:18.964
- Trashing a free
refugee clinic.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.764
That is the lowest of the low.
- I couldn't agree more.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.530
Ken is a bit much though,
isn't he? Talk about delusions

07:24.570 --> 07:27.835
of grandeur. "It was
a tragedy of epic proportions"?

07:27.880 --> 07:30.508
_ - It's not delusional _
If you're actually domg It.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.472
Wait, is this because
he doesn't watch hockey?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.647
- No! It's
because he was all cagey

07:34.680 --> 07:36.819
about what was
really in that cabinet.

07:36.850 --> 07:39.080
- OK, now who's being
delusional? Ken is the most...

07:39.120 --> 07:41.850
honest person I've ever known.
- You don't think it's strange

07:41.890 --> 07:43.949
that absolutely nothing
was missing from the clinic?

07:43.990 --> 07:46.026
_- Not if someone's
trying to send a message

07:46.060 --> 07:48.551
to shut the clinic down.
- I think your judgment

07:48.600 --> 07:50.761
is being clouded
by McDreamy back there.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.236
Exactly how long did you date
the good doctor for, anyway?

07:54.270 --> 07:57.535
- It was five years ago,
and... fleeting at best.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.800
- So, no lingering
feelings then?

07:59.840 --> 08:02.946
- Absolutely not. In the
distant rear-view mirror.

08:02.980 --> 08:06.814
- * Oh baby blue
- This looks like the place.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.909
- It's a bit hipster for
around here. Think this guy

08:08.950 --> 08:10.884
bet the gentrification
would spread east?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.888
- If he did, he's
losing big time.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.718
- Hey! How many times

08:15.760 --> 08:17.682
do I have to tell you
to get off my sidewalk?

08:17.730 --> 08:20.221
- OK, back off! This is my spot.

08:20.260 --> 08:23.263
- Go.
- Hey! Let's take it inside.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.928
- Yeah, stick it in
your man bun, loser!

08:25.970 --> 08:29.861
- Sorry. It's just, the people

08:29.910 --> 08:32.128
in this neighbourhood, they're
driving me into bankruptcy.

08:32.170 --> 08:34.274
- Looks like a short trip.

08:34.310 --> 08:36.744
_-_If it's not that street
mUSICIan blocking my doorstep,

08:36.780 --> 08:38.771
it's the sweet old lady
who comes in and steals

08:38.810 --> 08:41.244
all my raw sugar packs.
Or the jackass

08:41.280 --> 08:44.078
who parks himself in that window
for days and just lights up

08:44.120 --> 08:47.089
these disgusting cigars.
What is it, 1972?

08:47.120 --> 08:49.953
- And that clinic across the
street. That can't be helping!

08:49.990 --> 08:52.322
- That place should be
shut down. Yeah.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.193
Those people. It's
a magnet for all kinds.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.118
And none of them
drink cappuccino.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.092
- Mind ifI use
the facilities?

08:59.130 --> 09:00.961
I'm feeling a bit sick
to my stomach suddenly.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.662
- Yeah, it's in the back.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.666
You guys are gonna buy
something though, right?

09:05.710 --> 09:08.270
- Oh yeah.
How about

09:08.310 --> 09:12.770
a beet and ginger smoothie?
- You read my mind.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.175
***

09:36.140 --> 09:38.301
Wow!

09:38.340 --> 09:42.003
That's... _
really... something.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.804
- Yeah! And it goes great
with a gluten-free scone.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.875
- I bet it does!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.787
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?!

09:49.820 --> 09:52.186
- Doesn't_that look like the
same paint that's all over

09:52.220 --> 09:54.814
the front of the clinic?
- It does appear to be
a similar colour.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.727
- We're private investigators

09:57.760 --> 10:00.126
looking into the break-in
at the "magnet for all kinds"

10:00.160 --> 10:02.048
across the street.
- You wouldn't happen to know

10:02.100 --> 10:04.068
anything about that, would you?
- I don't know

10:04.100 --> 10:06.660
what you're talking about.
- Hm! The label says it contains

10:06.700 --> 10:08.998
citrus_oil. Bet that'd
pop In a lab test.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.133
Let me just call my
good buddy, Detective Mazhari.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.934
- OK, uh, look,
stop. I... I...

10:13.980 --> 10:16.107
I admit it,
I tagged the clinic.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.370
But I was really,
really pissed off,

10:18.410 --> 10:20.970
OK? Every cent
that I have is sunk

10:21.020 --> 10:23.215
into this place and
those people are ruining me!

10:23.250 --> 10:25.286
- "Those people"
are your neighbours.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.311
Maybe you should embrace
the community you're living in

10:27.360 --> 10:29.726
instead of charging $6.95
for a shortbread cookie.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.318
- Well, maybe if you should
checked out the price of organic

10:31.360 --> 10:33.294
rice flour, you
wouldn't be so judgey!

10:33.330 --> 10:36.697
***
I'm sorry.

10:36.730 --> 10:39.028
Oh my God, I am
losing it, aren't I?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.662
I feel really, really
bad about the graffiti,

10:44.710 --> 10:46.928
and I will never
do that again.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.198
But I swear, I had nothing
to do with that break-in.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.777
- Why should we
believe you?

10:51.810 --> 10:53.949
- Because it was obviously
the protection guy.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.087
Thugs who make you pay them
money not to trash your place,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.759
pretending it's insurance--
- We know what a protection guy

11:01.790 --> 11:03.257
is. You're saying there's one
in the neighbourhood?

11:03.290 --> 11:05.451
- Yeah. I don't
know his name,

11:05.490 --> 11:08.197
but, uh, he stopped by
a couple of days after I opened

11:08.230 --> 11:10.369
and said
if I didn't pay up,

11:10.400 --> 11:12.789
something bad
might happen here.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.432
That guy is
bleeding me dry.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.267
***

11:22.510 --> 11:25.172
- Makes sense. Ken's
not the type of guy

11:25.210 --> 11:28.316
to give into extortion.
He obviously refused to pay

11:28.350 --> 11:30.443
and took the consequences.
- But why not just tell us

11:30.490 --> 11:32.378
he's being threatened?
Why try to blame it

11:32.420 --> 11:35.412
on the Bitter Snob caf?
He's clearly hiding something.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.826
- Just because
you don't like him

11:37.860 --> 11:39.487
doesn't mean we can
start throwrng accusations

11:39.530 --> 11:41.452
in his face.
- Is there something about you

11:41.500 --> 11:44.298
and Ken that I'm missing?
- I'm going to go talk to Maz,

11:44.330 --> 11:46.992
see if he knows who this
extortion guy might be.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.463
- Wh... I can drive you.
- No, I'm good.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.138
I'll meet you
back at the office.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.503
***

12:03.120 --> 12:05.918
- OK, look, before you do
whatever you came here to do,

12:05.950 --> 12:07.952
lemme just remind you
that I bruise easily.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.788
You're smiling.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.320
Wait, is that a good
smile or an evil smile?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.499
- Good smile.

12:14.530 --> 12:16.293
- It went well.
: I knew it!

12:16.330 --> 12:18.969
Look, I know I should've
told you beforehand,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.365
but ifI did, you never would
have gone through with it

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
by yourself,
am I right? Especially...

12:22.840 --> 12:24.808
after what happened?
- Water under the bridge

12:24.840 --> 12:27.138
for both of us, don't
give it another thought.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.842
- Thank god.
- I'm just here for a name.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.815
It looks like there's an
extortion racket gomg on

12:32.850 --> 12:34.818
in Ken's neighbourhood.
Businesses are being threatened

12:34.850 --> 12:36.818
if they don't pay up.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.488
So you think this is more than
just some kids busting windows?

12:38.520 --> 12:40.283
I could lean on the department
to take this more seriously.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.459
- I just need to
rule it out. Chances are

12:42.490 --> 12:44.458
there's nothing to it.
- Well, that part of town,

12:44.490 --> 12:46.799
it could be
a couple of people.

12:46.830 --> 12:49.321
My money's on
Alessandro Kostopoulos.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.260
Very serious customer.
He hangs out

12:51.300 --> 12:53.063
at a barbershop down the street
from the clinic, but Angie,

12:53.100 --> 12:54.988
you need to watch
your step around this guy.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.100
- OK, I will. Thanks.
- My pleasure.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.802
- Hey, by the way,
do you remember

13:00.840 --> 13:03.070
Channing VonKlempt? Obsessed
with you in high school,

13:03.110 --> 13:05.544
went to the same college
so she could be close?

13:05.580 --> 13:09.016
Yeah,
I remember her

13:09.050 --> 13:12.042
- Well, turns out
that she's still single.

13:12.090 --> 13:15.059
And I just sent her a warm
personal message from you.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.519
Oh, this email is
just emojis. What is

13:21.560 --> 13:23.824
with the deranged
Chihuahua sticker pack?

13:23.870 --> 13:26.361
How did you even get
my login information? Angie!

13:26.400 --> 13:30.109
Angie!
***

13:38.880 --> 13:40.848
- Well, that doesn't
look too shady

13:40.880 --> 13:42.279
- If Ken's in trouble
with this guy, I wanna know.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.618
Stay close and
follow my lead.

13:44.650 --> 13:47.414
I'm Sally Cubit, this is

13:47.460 --> 13:49.883
my husband Calvin.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.057
- Calvin and I are opening
a store in the neighbourhood.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.058
What kind of store?
- Knick knacks. Sally's got

13:54.100 --> 13:56.489
quite the chutzpah
when it comes to tchotchkes.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.327
- We were told
to talk to you first

13:58.370 --> 14:00.395
about "additional insurance".

14:00.440 --> 14:02.567
- That's wise
of you. Basrcally

14:02.600 --> 14:04.500
I provide protection
for things that aren't

14:04.540 --> 14:06.508
covered under your policy.

14:06.540 --> 14:09.031
- Oh, fires,
robberies, vandalism...

14:09.080 --> 14:11.969
Terrible things can happen
to a business overnight.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.217
Especially if the owners
are, let's say, negligent

14:14.250 --> 14:17.185
in their bill payments.
- Oh! So, is that what happened

14:17.220 --> 14:19.609
with the free clinic across the
street? Maybe the doctor there

14:19.650 --> 14:21.584
refused to cave to your
not

14:21.620 --> 14:23.326
- Are you accusing me
of trashing the clinic?

14:23.360 --> 14:25.282
- I for one think

14:25.330 --> 14:27.298
maybe we shouldn't be.
- I don't know who you are

14:27.330 --> 14:29.890
or what business it is of yours,
but I want to make myself

14:29.930 --> 14:32.490
perfectly clear: Dr. Ken
is a friend of mine.

14:32.530 --> 14:35.636
You understand?
How's that?

14:35.670 --> 14:38.662
- That is definitely none of
your business. And if you're
smart, you'll keep it that way.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.508
***

14:53.660 --> 14:56.356
***
- Face it, Ange! That guy

14:56.390 --> 14:58.449
called Ken a friend. You know
what that means, right?

14:58.490 --> 15:00.993
Ken is connected.
To organized crime.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.090
- Come on. I've known Ken for
years. He would never be
involved with criminals.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.121
- Maybe the Ken
you knew before wouldn't,

15:06.170 --> 15:08.229
but that was a long time
ago. Five years, right?

15:08.270 --> 15:10.534
- Maybe, just

15:10.570 --> 15:13.437
maybe, Ken's
working with Alessandro

15:13.480 --> 15:15.402
and they're selling
drugs out of the clinic

15:15.440 --> 15:17.499
and the break-in was
some sort of retaliation.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.541
- That's ridiculous.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.343
You only went out
with him for a short time,

15:21.380 --> 15:23.587
and then he suddenly
left for Africa.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.508
What made him just leave?

15:25.550 --> 15:28.189
Just leave it alone.
- You're not telling me

15:28.220 --> 15:30.984
everything. Did you suspect
him of something back then?

15:31.030 --> 15:32.622
Was he in some sort of trouble?

15:32.660 --> 15:35.458
Ken Graham is not
a suspect In this case.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.197
Let's pick this up tomorrow.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.207
- Nothing. Um... I have

15:45.240 --> 15:47.970
a special assignment for you.
Just between you and me, OK?

15:48.010 --> 15:50.604
- Exactly.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.504
- I need you
to investigate

15:52.550 --> 15:54.518
Dr. Ken Graham.

15:54.550 --> 15:58.486
***

16:00.460 --> 16:03.554
- I hope you like this place.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.148
They have an
excellent duck tartare.

16:05.190 --> 16:08.694
- Yeah, sounds good.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.563
- And they also have a really
great monkey brain fondue

16:11.600 --> 16:13.591
with these delicious
horsehair croutons.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.607
I'm sorry. I just...

16:22.640 --> 16:24.346
I can't stop thinking
about this case that Angie

16:24.380 --> 16:27.713
and I took on this morning.
- Talk it out! I‘d love to _hear
what you're Investigating.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.639
- OK. Um...

16:30.690 --> 16:33.011
There was_a break-in
at a medical clinic

16:33.060 --> 16:35.688
in Danforth Village.
And the client...

16:35.720 --> 16:39.554
: I don't know, I just
get a bad feeling about the guy.

16:39.590 --> 16:42.559
- Some old boyfriend of Angie's

16:42.600 --> 16:45.421
who she thinks can
do no wrong. But...

16:45.470 --> 16:47.597
the guy's not telling us
everything he knows.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.438
- So, is her judgment
clouded or is yours?

16:50.470 --> 16:52.734
- Definitely hers,
no question.

16:52.770 --> 16:56.308
- Mm-hm. Maybe you're
being overprotective?

16:56.340 --> 16:58.774
I mean, she is your partner.
- Hm, woulda been hard to tell

16:58.810 --> 17:00.641
today. She bit
my head off three times

17:00.680 --> 17:03.148
before lunch, and that's
one more time than usual.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.239
- Well, hey! Do you want some
advice from an excellent lavwer?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.781
- Uh-huh!

17:08.820 --> 17:11.550
Don't harbour any preconceived
notions about this guy.

17:11.590 --> 17:14.320
Just follow the evidence.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.624
Unless, you know,
there's some reason

17:16.660 --> 17:18.423
why you wanna knock
this ex-boyfriend

17:18.470 --> 17:20.392
off his pedestal...?

17:20.440 --> 17:23.204
- No, I can't think of one.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.606
: Would you
like some more wine?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.403
- I would, please!
- Good!

17:37.490 --> 17:39.412
(whirring of the
electric window)

17:39.450 --> 17:42.317
- Something like that.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.453
- I was just headed out.
House call.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.822
- Hop in. I'll
drive you. I wanted

17:46.860 --> 17:50.261
to talk to you about
something. Someone, actually.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.598
- Sure.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.758
- I met a guy who said
he's a friend of yours.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.600
Who's that?
- Alessandro Kostopoulos.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.835
- I see.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.849
And you're wondering how
the two of us got so close.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.144
- So he is a friend.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.875
- Oh, this is my patient's
place right up here.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.219
I hope you brought an appetite.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.582
You haven't even
answered my question yet.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.679
- It's actually more proper
to have a woman present.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.450
Farah is devout. You'd be
doing us both a favour.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.594
And I promise you I will
tell you all about Alessandro

18:21.630 --> 18:24.690
after. Deal?
***

18:27.740 --> 18:31.301
And out.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.104
Again.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.505
- If I knew Ken
was bringing company,

18:38.550 --> 18:41.246
I would have made baklava.
- This all looks amazing.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.714
- I gain ten pounds
every time I come.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.548
Sound's good. Everything
is under control.

18:46.590 --> 18:49.411
- How long have you
lived here, in Toronto?

18:49.460 --> 18:52.429
_- Six months.
I arrived last summer.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.348
- Yes.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.925
It_was a difficult
journey but...

18:56.960 --> 19:00.430
the man I was married to
was not easy to live With.

19:00.470 --> 19:03.234
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- You did what you had to do.

19:03.270 --> 19:06.433
She was very brave.

19:06.470 --> 19:09.576
Now you can
start over again.

19:09.610 --> 19:11.908
- You are a lucky woman
to have a man so good.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.841
- Oh... Angie and I
aren't a couple.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.280
She has a private investigation
firm with her boyfriend.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.379
- No I don't. No... I mean,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.581
I have a PI company,
but Shade and I aren't--

19:22.620 --> 19:25.919
Then... Ken
and I aren't--

19:25.960 --> 19:28.793
- I see...

19:28.830 --> 19:31.264
- Angie and I
used to see each other.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.360
But that was
a long time ago.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.834
Let me get you
some more tea.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.667
- Thank you.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.445
Should I help?

19:43.480 --> 19:47.211
- Let her... let her
gather herself.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.275
She'll be fine.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.788
This is very
sweet of you.

19:51.820 --> 19:54.459
Farah doesn't get to see
many people except for me.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.981
- Post traumatic stress.

19:57.020 --> 19:59.921
Farah downplays the amount
of abuse she suffered,

19:59.960 --> 20:02.895
but... Halfway
across the world

20:02.930 --> 20:04.921
from her husband
and she's still terrified.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.666
- So that's why you come here.
She's afraid to go out.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.635
- Being a doctor means
taking care of people

20:10.670 --> 20:14.731
wherever they are
and... whoever they are.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.440
- His nephew
had an "accident"

20:21.480 --> 20:23.983
cleaning his gun, and he landed
on my doorstep, bleeding out.

20:24.020 --> 20:27.285
- And you saved him.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.686
Did you report that
gunshot wound to the police?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.881
It's the law, you know.
- I know.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.398
But I can't have my patients
worried that I'm gonna turn them

20:34.430 --> 20:36.819
in to the authorities.
I'm a doctor,

20:36.860 --> 20:40.660
and that means... working
outside the rules sometimes.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.498
***

20:49.710 --> 20:51.678
Would you like
to come in for a drink?

20:51.710 --> 20:54.508
I'd love to...
talk, catch up.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.908
- You're a client. I have
rules about those things.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.316
- You really don't have to keep
looking into the break-in.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.055
Places get hit
around here all the time.

21:04.090 --> 21:07.059
Just last week, a specialist
down the road got robbed

21:07.090 --> 21:10.298
- Wait. Another medical clinic
got broken Into recently?

21:10.330 --> 21:11.968
- Yeah, but--
- I gotta go.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.561
- Yeah.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.865
Oh, Ken...
Your friend Alessandro.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.969
He's squeezing your
neighbour, the cafe owner,

21:21.010 --> 21:24.002
for every cent he's got. There's
no clear end with guys like him.

21:30.750 --> 21:34.083
***

21:34.120 --> 21:36.657
(incomprehensible chatter
and phone buzzing)

21:36.690 --> 21:39.420
- Oh. It's Angie.
I gotta take this.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.997
- Mm-hm. Yeah!
- Excuse me one second.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.794
- Hey.

21:44.830 --> 21:47.333
Ken just told me that another
doctor in Danforth Village

21:47.370 --> 21:50.339
got broken into last week.
That's two medical places

21:50.370 --> 21:52.759
in three square blocks
in a matter of days.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.972
- Yes. And he had a perfectly
reasonable explanation

21:59.010 --> 22:01.376
for Alessandro
calling him a friend.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.445
He pulled a bullet
out of his nephew.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.913
- I'll have to remember that
perfectly reasonable explanation

22:05.950 --> 22:08.089
next time I'm late.
- Ken isn't who you think he is,

22:08.120 --> 22:11.851
Shade. Believe me. He took me to
see one of his patients, Farah.

22:11.890 --> 22:14.120
[She's too scared to
leave the house

22:14.160 --> 22:17.425
I'm sorry, are you out?

22:17.470 --> 22:20.735
- Uh...
: The mystery woman!

22:20.770 --> 22:23.068
You're on a date!
- No!

22:23.100 --> 22:25.534
No, that was...
That was Don

22:25.570 --> 22:27.606
teaching Jules how
to make that popping sound

22:27.640 --> 22:29.870
when you... put
your finger in your mouth,

22:29.910 --> 22:32.401
like...

22:35.480 --> 22:37.414
You're not buying
any of this, are you?

22:37.450 --> 22:39.918
I'm gonna go talk

22:39.950 --> 22:42.680
to the doctor_ _
from the x-ray clinic.
Someone must know something.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.883
(indistinct chatter, music
and popping sound)

22:49.100 --> 22:51.466
- I... meant... to tell her.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.094
Just... today...
wasn't a good day.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.791
- Look...

22:56.840 --> 22:58.967
I like you.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.672
: The truth is,

23:01.710 --> 23:05.669
I could come
to like you a lot.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.769
So if you're not
seeing things that way,

23:07.820 --> 23:09.913
then".

23:09.950 --> 23:12.817
***

23:17.960 --> 23:19.757
Check, please.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.734
- Thank you so much for
meeting me, Dr. Thomas.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.863
- My receptionist told me you're
investigating the other break-in

23:30.910 --> 23:33.504
near my clinic. You think
they're connected?

23:33.540 --> 23:36.475
- It's a possibility. Could
you tell me what happened?

23:36.510 --> 23:38.876
- I arrived and
found the place trashed:

23:38.910 --> 23:41.640
drawers emptied,
cupboards cleared...

23:41.680 --> 23:43.511
- And what did the
thieves actually take?

23:43.550 --> 23:45.848
- Thief. Singular.
They caught the guy.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.450
VVhen?
- Two days after the break-in.

23:48.490 --> 23:50.720
But I'm told he's
already been released.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.698
- Despite an array of computers
and expensive equipment

23:56.730 --> 23:59.927
at his disposal, all he took
was a bunch of x-rays.

23:59.970 --> 24:02.768
Like this.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.837
Hardly the crime
of the century.

24:05.870 --> 24:07.701
***

24:10.750 --> 24:13.639
- Separate break-ins
at two medical clinics

24:13.680 --> 24:15.944
on the same block, and all
that's missing are x

24:15.980 --> 24:18.778
- Why would someone
steal x

24:18.820 --> 24:20.811
The person looking to prove
malpractice, maybe?

24:20.860 --> 24:22.885
- Building evidence
for a lawsuit.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.127
- Ken does work the nightshift

24:25.160 --> 24:27.549
at the ER. Maybe he botched
some guy's treatment

24:27.600 --> 24:30.023
and the guy's looking to sue.
- OK, all roads lead to Ken

24:30.060 --> 24:31.869
for you. So the guy doesn't
watch hockey, so what?

24:31.900 --> 24:33.834
- Oh come on! Who
doesn't watch hockey?

24:33.870 --> 24:35.997
Besides, it doesn't explain
the break-in at Ken's clinic

24:36.040 --> 24:38.201
or the press-on nail
we found at the scene.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.208
I'm gonna go talk to Maz.
We need to find the guy

24:40.240 --> 24:42.504
who stole the x-rays.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.145
- Hey! Hi! You're back!

24:45.180 --> 24:48.672
- Nothing at all. Zero.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.517
- Have you thought
about trying yoga?

24:50.550 --> 24:52.643
Breathe, Zoe.
Just breathe.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.654
- You found something
didn't you? Ken's got

24:58.690 --> 25:00.851
a secret identity. Gambling
debts or something.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.959
- At first, all I could
find were accolades.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.865
So many humanitarian awards
and citations of honour--

25:04.900 --> 25:07.937
- Yeah, OK, OK--
- But then I started

25:07.970 --> 25:11.599
checking through his Ameechee
timeline, looking back at the
months before he went overseas.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.905
- Never trust a_ man with
an open profile. And?

25:14.940 --> 25:18.307
- Nothing. He deleted it all.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.740
Every post, every picture:
gone for months.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.283
- I asked myself the
same question.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.209
So I went through his friends'
sites, and...

25:27.250 --> 25:29.059
Did you know he knows
the Prime Minister of India?

25:29.090 --> 25:31.684
- Just get to the point.
- OK.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.324
Look. To the wedding

25:34.360 --> 25:36.794
of Dr. Kenneth Graham and --

25:36.830 --> 25:39.094
Angela Susan Everett.

25:39.130 --> 25:41.690
***

25:44.610 --> 25:46.566
- This is the guy Maz said

25:46.610 --> 25:49.078
was arrested for_
the great x-ray heist.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.805
- Uhlhuh.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.772
You were acting strange
the whole way over here.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.745
- Nothing! Ijust...
found something out

25:55.780 --> 25:57.589
about a friend of mine.
Something I never knew.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.611
Something they
never told me.

25:59.650 --> 26:03.017
- OK! Aanays, he was
released pending trial.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.325
Apparently, he works this
neighbourhood, asking
for change.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.852
- Hm...

26:09.900 --> 26:13.597
***

26:16.970 --> 26:19.359
- Thanks.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.971
We were hoping you could
answer a few questions for us?

26:24.010 --> 26:27.719
Cheeseburger and a double
espresso. That's my going rate.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.810
- You got it.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.717
- This guy comes to me,
offers me 500 bucks

26:33.760 --> 26:37.059
to go in and grab as many
x-rays as I can find.

26:37.090 --> 26:40.184
- He just... approached
you on the street?

26:40.230 --> 26:42.289
Standing right there
where you found me today.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.869
No idea. I got arrested
and I never saw him again.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.664
- So he didn't hire you to
break into Ken's clinic too?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.769
What, do I look like
a career criminal to you?

26:54.340 --> 26:56.808
It was a one-time deal.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.149
- You remember what
this guy looked like?

26:59.180 --> 27:01.319
- Dark eyes,
dark hair,

27:01.350 --> 27:04.012
and he was smoking
horrible cigars.

27:04.050 --> 27:07.019
- Right. Didn't Ryan just say
something about a guy smoking

27:07.050 --> 27:09.382
disgusting cigars at his caf.
- One of his many complaints.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.957
Would you be willing to
sit down with a sketch artist?

27:11.990 --> 27:14.094
Buy me another round
and you're on.

27:14.130 --> 27:16.849
***

27:16.900 --> 27:19.118
- Yeah.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.035
Yeah-yeah-yeah,
that's the guy.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.061
Yeah, he sat at the window
a bunch of times over the course

27:23.100 --> 27:25.967
of a few days,
and then he was gone.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.808
- Last time I saw him was

27:28.840 --> 27:31.047
about a week ago, maybe?
- So before the break-ins.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.207
- Hey, check it out.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.912
That_'s Ken's clinic over there
and If I really crane my neck,

27:35.950 --> 27:38.418
I can just make out
the x-ray place

27:38.450 --> 27:40.987
- But nobody would be
able to see him.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.885
- Yeah.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.683
- Uh, ahem! Hey! Hey,

27:44.730 --> 27:47.085
um, I got a surprise

27:47.130 --> 27:50.054
insurance rebate
from the protection guy.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.364
Was that because of you?

27:52.400 --> 27:55.392
- More like a friend of mine.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.965
- Thanks.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.137
- I sent the pic

28:00.170 --> 28:02.274
to Ken's clinic, but no one
who works there recognizes him.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.346
- So our mystery Smoker cases

28:04.380 --> 28:06.746
of both clinics for a few days

28:06.780 --> 28:09.010
making sure he isn't seen.
- Then he hires Darin

28:09.050 --> 28:11.883
to break into the x-ray
lab and steal some old film.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.444
- But Darin gets caught,
so he hires someone else

28:13.490 --> 28:15.708
for Ken's clinic --
- Who leaves behind

28:15.760 --> 28:18.251
a press-on nail
with some weird flower on it.

28:18.290 --> 28:21.054
- I don't know.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.250
But if he follows
the same M.O., he'll look for...

28:23.300 --> 28:26.428
another street person
to do the second job.

28:26.470 --> 28:29.837
Looking for a...
female panhandler, maybe?

28:29.870 --> 28:31.861
- The flower

28:31.910 --> 28:34.378
looks familiar somehow.

28:34.410 --> 28:37.379
- Oh! It's not a flower.
It's a Chinese character

28:37.410 --> 28:40.379
for music. They just
made it look like a flower.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.741
What'd I say?
Was it good

28:45.790 --> 28:48.258
It was good, wasn't it?
Hm! Yeah! One for the 20!

28:51.890 --> 28:53.824
- * Another colour over you
Oh baby blue *

28:53.860 --> 28:57.023
- There she is. Music
plus panhandling equals...?

28:57.060 --> 28:59.893
- Street musician with an
attitude. What do you think?

28:59.930 --> 29:03.229
- That amp looks new.
- I bet it costs about $500.

29:03.270 --> 29:06.068
- * You little sleepy head

29:06.110 --> 29:09.238
- Sounding good today.
- Thanks! Heh!

29:09.280 --> 29:12.807
Oh! Wow!
Thanks, there.

29:12.850 --> 29:15.114
- Nice nails.
- Thanks! Yeah, they're good...

29:15.150 --> 29:17.471
good for playing.
- Except you're missing one,

29:17.520 --> 29:19.488
and it looks a lot like this.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.408
- You want to tell us
about the guy who hired you

29:21.460 --> 29:24.122
to do the break
Umph! Really?

29:27.530 --> 29:30.124
- Let me go!

29:30.160 --> 29:32.321
Dammit!
- Last chance!

29:32.370 --> 29:35.897
Who is he?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.862
- I'm not saying nothing
about that clinic, OK!

29:37.910 --> 29:40.367
- We didn't even mention
the clinic. Call the police,

29:40.410 --> 29:42.207
get them to come get her.
- Hold on, she dropped these.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.276
Oxy, some other pain killer...

29:44.310 --> 29:46.244
But look at this:
no doctor's name,

29:46.280 --> 29:49.317
no prescription number, nothing.
- Did you get these from
the clinic?

29:49.350 --> 29:53.286
That guy put me up to it.
I found them in his cabinet, OK?

29:53.320 --> 29:55.356
- Didn't Ken say they
don't keep drugs on site?

29:55.390 --> 29:58.154
- He lied to us.

29:58.190 --> 30:01.193
***

30:06.270 --> 30:08.534
- Thought you didn't
keep drugs here.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.905
- I can explain.
- The same way

30:12.940 --> 30:15.238
you explained about Alessandro?
Are you selling on the side?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.407
Is that why that thug
calls you a "friend"?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.147
- Why he gave the money back
to the cafe owner after
you asked him to?

30:20.180 --> 30:22.512
- You know me better than that.

30:22.550 --> 30:24.882
Follow me.

30:27.090 --> 30:29.411
***

30:31.630 --> 30:36.920
- Hey! I wasjust, uh...
- It's OK. Just open it.

30:41.270 --> 30:44.262
You're right. We have been
secretly distributing drugs

30:44.310 --> 30:46.437
from the clinic.
But not for profit.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.207
- Drugs are expensive. Lots of
people in this neighbourhood

30:52.250 --> 30:55.048
don't have coverage, so--
- We started an underground

30:55.080 --> 30:57.275
program where leftover
medication could be donated

30:57.320 --> 30:59.481
back to the clinic,
for other patients to use.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.659
- Redistributing medication
is against the law.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.887
- I'm a doctor first.
- Even if it means working

31:04.930 --> 31:08.024
outside the rules.
- There are other
people involved.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.051
My patients.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.231
- I understand.

31:21.010 --> 31:23.979
- I gotta admit,

31:24.010 --> 31:26.376
you're a far more forgiving
person than I would be.

31:26.410 --> 31:28.970
- What's that
supposed to mean?

31:29.020 --> 31:31.181
- The guy lies to your face
and you shrug your shoulders.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.586
: After
everything else he's done.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.657
- I know about the engagement.

31:36.690 --> 31:39.625
***

31:39.660 --> 31:41.696
- It's amazing what you can

31:41.730 --> 31:44.267
find out on the internet.
- I expressly asked you

31:44.300 --> 31:46.393
not to look into Ken.
- I was concerned!

31:46.430 --> 31:48.466
And for good reason,
it turns out!

31:48.500 --> 31:50.934
- Yes, that's right!

31:50.970 --> 31:52.562
How can you trust that guy
after he left you at the altar

31:52.610 --> 31:55.078
and took off for Nigeria?

31:57.640 --> 32:00.279
- You find out
that we were engaged

32:00.310 --> 32:02.642
and you assume
that Ken ran off on me?

32:05.390 --> 32:08.450
- No. I called off the wedding.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.651
I left Ken at the altar,
not the other way around.

32:10.690 --> 32:13.454
- But Maz said he was
the one who got away.

32:13.490 --> 32:16.948
- He did. Cause I let him go.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.218
***

32:19.270 --> 32:21.261
- Oh!

32:23.400 --> 32:26.608
I'm sorry. Forget
I said anything.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.507
- Just drop me
at the police station.

32:38.050 --> 32:41.611
OK, so this guy just
approaches you on the street,

32:41.660 --> 32:43.412
asks you to break
into a clinic --

32:43.460 --> 32:45.587
- Aren't I supposed
to get a lawyer?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.427
- You had a lawyer. You fired
him the second you met him.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.655
- Mm-hm. I don't like suits.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.464
Do you like those?

32:52.500 --> 32:55.139
- This guy told you to break
into the clinic and steal drugs.

32:55.170 --> 32:57.638
- No. Ijust found them.

32:57.670 --> 33:01.470
He wanted stuff with names.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.603
- Yeah. So, I checked through
the files and all they had

33:03.640 --> 33:07.076
were these ID numbers. I mean,
who the hell does that?

33:07.110 --> 33:10.045
And then, I found the drug
cabinet, and there was a book

33:10.080 --> 33:12.787
inside with them.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.357
- A notebook with names
and addresses. I showed it

33:15.390 --> 33:17.688
to the guy, and he got
really excited. He took that,

33:17.720 --> 33:19.529
a bottle of pills, and then
he gave me 500 bucks.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.324
- It was a couple hours ago.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.692
I was supposed to meet him
after I broke into the clinic,

33:24.730 --> 33:27.290
but then, bunhead
owner chased me off.

33:27.330 --> 33:30.367
So, I just kept going back,
and then, B-I-N-G-O, cigar guy

33:30.400 --> 33:33.733
was there.
- So, he's after patient names.

33:33.770 --> 33:35.601
The x-rays in the other
clinic had names on them too.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.631
- Yeah, but if he only took
one pill bottle, then maybe

33:37.680 --> 33:40.069
he's only after one patient.
- We need to figure out

33:40.110 --> 33:42.544
whose pills are missing.
I'll call Ken. What did you do

33:42.580 --> 33:44.719
with the rest of
the drugs you stole?

33:44.750 --> 33:47.412
- Uh, he said I could keep them!
- I need those drugs, Maz.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.418
- I'll send a unit
to her apartment.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.348
***

33:53.560 --> 33:56.358
- They took the ledger, too. It
had all the patient info in it.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.265
- We think they're looking
for someone specific.

33:58.300 --> 33:59.767
Someone who you might
give drugs to.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.768
- What was supposed
to go out that day..?

34:01.800 --> 34:03.688
What if it's someone
that went to both clinics,

34:03.740 --> 34:05.708
Ken's and the x
- Why go to the trouble

34:05.740 --> 34:08.436
of paying people to break in?
Why not just watch

34:08.480 --> 34:10.436
for the patient
from the street?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.698
- Because he already did
and it didn't work.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.445
He sat there for days, at that
caf, and he never saw her.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.278
- Yeah! Farah's supposed

34:17.320 --> 34:19.311
to go for check-ups at your
clinic, but she's too afraid

34:19.350 --> 34:22.319
to leave the house.
Did she ever go to the
x

34:22.360 --> 34:24.385
- I've been begging her to go
for an angio, but she always

34:24.430 --> 34:26.557
cancels her appointments.
- But someone close to her,

34:26.590 --> 34:28.626
someone that knows she has
a heart problem would expect her

34:28.660 --> 34:31.265
to go there regularly.
And to your clinic.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.394
- Her millanium's gone.
For her heart condition.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.136
And her address is in the
ledger. He couldn't possibly

34:37.170 --> 34:39.138
have followed her
back to Canada...

34:42.410 --> 34:45.470
Look. It's Farah's
page from back home.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.603
- That's
the Smoker, alright.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.278
- Omar Javadian. Farah's
abusive ex-husband.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.209
- He's traveled halfway across
the world to hunt her down.

34:59.160 --> 35:02.220
- Maz! I need you to
get a squad car over to
the address I texted you ASAP.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.818
- Angie, a unit's on its way.
It'll be there in five minutes

35:03.860 --> 35:06.522
- Five minutes!
- She didn't answer the phone.

35:06.570 --> 35:08.765
She never leaves home.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.201
he's dangerous.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.141
- Stay here. Wait for the cops.

35:29.620 --> 35:32.748
- Farah, it's me, Angie.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.929
- She has to be home,
she's afraid to go out.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.495
- Stand back!

35:43.640 --> 35:45.301
Get out of here!

35:45.340 --> 35:47.433
- We're not going anywhere.
- Angie please --

35:47.470 --> 35:49.199
I came all this way for you.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.344
Buddy, take it easy.
- Get out of here!

35:51.380 --> 35:53.507
This is none of your business!
- Omar, just listen--

35:53.550 --> 35:55.575
- Shut up! You caused
enough trouble.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.440
- Omar, the police are
on their way right now..

35:57.480 --> 35:59.948
She's my wife!

35:59.990 --> 36:03.209
- She_ doesn't want to be
With you anymore.
- Let me go.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.728
- Hey, buddy,

36:05.760 --> 36:07.819
Think about what you're doing.
You don't want to do this.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.748
- She married me.
And then she left.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.360
You have no idea
what I've done to find her!

36:12.400 --> 36:14.789
She's coming home with me.
- You can't make someone

36:14.840 --> 36:17.434
love you.
- She left me with nothing.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.859
I have no one now!
- And I'm sure that hurts.

36:19.910 --> 36:22.208
A lot. But you can't force
someone to be with you.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.935
That's not how this works.
I think you know that.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.369
They're
gonna be inside any minute.

36:26.410 --> 36:28.378
- Let her go
before it's too late.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.876
- Shade!

36:29.920 --> 36:32.718
Are you OK?

36:39.260 --> 36:41.490
- Stay down! Stay down!
Hands where I can see them!

36:41.530 --> 36:43.498
Come on!

36:43.530 --> 36:46.795
- Hey thanks, Ken!
We'll take it from here.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.391
- Yeah.
- OK buddy, up you go!

36:50.440 --> 36:53.830
This guy is great!

36:53.870 --> 36:55.974
***

37:07.490 --> 37:09.981
- She doesn't have
to be scared anymore.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.319
- A real second chance.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.454
- You guys wait right here.
I'll be right back.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.398
- Yeah.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.575
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the drugs

37:33.610 --> 37:35.942
from the beginning.
I should've trusted you.

37:35.980 --> 37:39.381
- Thanks.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.650
But I understand
why you didn't.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.988
After... everything
that happened before.

37:48.030 --> 37:49.725
It was good
to see you

37:52.030 --> 37:54.897
Good luck with everything.
- Yeah.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.397
You too.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.603
***

38:22.100 --> 38:24.091
- OK!

38:24.130 --> 38:26.018
- I know you're dying to find
out why I called it off

38:26.070 --> 38:28.026
with Ken, even though it's
none of your damned business.

38:28.070 --> 38:31.403
: So...?

38:33.070 --> 38:35.800
- I wasn't ready.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.876
I didn't know who I was
yet or what I wanted,

38:37.910 --> 38:40.708
and if I married Ken, I
would've just ended up being

38:40.750 --> 38:43.947
Mrs. Dr. Perfect.
- Yeah, his light does
shine pretty glaringly.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.540
- Then my dad opened the agency
and offered me a job...

38:46.590 --> 38:49.889
and suddenly, I knew
what I wanted out of life.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.480
- So you backed out.
- Yeah.

38:52.530 --> 38:55.124
Three days before the wedding.
- Ooh!

38:55.160 --> 38:57.890
Ken was great
about it, like he's...

38:57.930 --> 39:00.967
great about everything.
And then,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.833
two days later, he
accepted the job overseas.

39:03.870 --> 39:06.464
- But you know who you are now,
right? There's no...

39:06.510 --> 39:08.774
chance of you getting
lost in his shadow.

39:08.810 --> 39:10.971
You could always
give it another shot.

39:11.010 --> 39:13.149
If he really is
the one that got away.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.410
- Nah, it's too late.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.941
He'll never trust me again
after what I did to him.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.119
And trust is everything.

39:22.620 --> 39:26.579
- By the way, um...
I have been dating someone.

39:26.630 --> 39:29.053
And that someone is --
- Mel Parker.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.399
- Well, I figured

39:32.430 --> 39:34.466
there had to be_a reason _
you weren't bragging about it.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.593
Plus I saw

39:36.640 --> 39:38.938
a spark between you two
since day one.

39:38.970 --> 39:42.906
- And yet you're not mad.
I mean, this could affect

39:42.940 --> 39:45.079
our future dealings
with the Prosecutor's office

39:45.110 --> 39:47.101
if things end badly.
- Well then, make sure

39:47.150 --> 39:49.118
things don't end badly.

39:49.150 --> 39:51.118
***

39:51.150 --> 39:53.641
- I'll... do my best, boss.

40:03.630 --> 40:06.121
***

40:15.640 --> 40:17.938
- Not exactly sure,
to tell you the truth, but...

40:17.980 --> 40:20.744
you're obviously someone
that Angie respects a lot

40:20.780 --> 40:22.975
and I just get the feeling
we got off on the wrong foot.

40:23.020 --> 40:26.114
- You played for
Chicago, in the 90s.

40:26.150 --> 40:28.789
I saw the game where you won
the division championship.

40:28.820 --> 40:31.482
You scored on a penalty shot.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.624
- Yeah. If we're
telling the truth,

40:34.660 --> 40:36.958
Ithought
there was something

40:37.000 --> 40:40.219
going on between you and Angie,
so I got a bit... defensive.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.036
Seems ridiculous now. Who'd
think she'd ever go for someo--

40:45.070 --> 40:47.209
OK, OK, OK,
I got it. I got it.

40:50.110 --> 40:52.476
Anyway, I'm glad we cleared
the air. I get the feeling

40:52.510 --> 40:54.649
we're gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.012
- Yeah, I doubt
that, actually.

40:57.050 --> 40:59.985
I lied to her.
And she hates that.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.181
There's no way I'm getting
that second chance now.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.927
But...

41:04.960 --> 41:07.952
Thanks for stopping by, though.
- Yeah.

41:07.990 --> 41:10.754
Ken! Hold on a sec.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.768
Um...

41:12.800 --> 41:15.928
Angie's changed a lot
since you guys

41:15.970 --> 41:17.858
were together.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.028
You should give her a call.

41:21.070 --> 41:23.129
Yeah.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.068
***

41:25.110 --> 41:27.476
Yeah, I'm sure.

41:29.180 --> 41:32.047
Call her.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.888
- * Hey ey ey

41:45.700 --> 41:48.191
- Hi.
- HI.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.830
- You look ravishing.

41:52.870 --> 41:55.600
Thanks.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.676
Hey, you know, I'm
going out with her.

41:57.710 --> 41:59.974
Melanie Parker,
Prosecuting Attorney.

42:00.010 --> 42:03.138
- You're such
an idiot!

42:03.180 --> 42:07.879
We are so
not staying for dessert.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.218
***

42:34.920 --> 42:37.138
- I hope it's
not too late.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.148
Your door was open.
- Huh!

42:39.190 --> 42:41.249
It's only...
one in the morning.

42:41.290 --> 42:43.349
- I was just delivering
twins in a cab

42:43.390 --> 42:45.358
and I thought I'd
swing by on the way home.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.585
- No. The twins

42:47.630 --> 42:50.224
were born in the hospital.

42:53.730 --> 42:57.632
I owe you an apology
for what I did back then.

42:57.670 --> 43:00.002
- Don't worry about it.
Five years in the jungle

43:00.040 --> 43:02.600
almost cured me.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.279
- I made some really hasty
decisions and I think about th--

43:05.310 --> 43:07.801
- Hey! You remember
in your car,

43:07.850 --> 43:10.114
back when I said
that I wanted to talk?

43:12.420 --> 43:14.752
I was lying.

43:14.790 --> 43:17.258
