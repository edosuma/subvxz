WEBVTT

01:39.281 --> 01:42.851
I was just sayin' there's
a tractor pull tomorrow

01:42.884 --> 01:44.854
and I thought I can do a story
on that.

01:46.155 --> 01:48.090
Didn't we just have one?

01:48.123 --> 01:49.092
Yeah.

01:49.125 --> 01:52.128
This is the state final
so it's in Kansas City.

01:52.161 --> 01:53.563
Why are we covering it?

01:53.596 --> 01:55.131
Phil's boy, he's in it.

01:55.164 --> 01:56.733
Oh, that's right.

01:59.634 --> 02:01.770
All right, you got anything
else?

02:01.804 --> 02:03.807
I could do a story on
the school board meeting.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.942
No, I'm gonna have the new
girl do that.

02:08.043 --> 02:08.879
Anything else?

02:11.814 --> 02:15.218
All right then, I guess
tractor pull it is.

02:17.687 --> 02:18.487
David, how 'bout you?

02:18.521 --> 02:19.956
What do you got?

02:19.988 --> 02:23.527
Police reports, Relay For
Life, Toys for Tots drive.

02:24.660 --> 02:25.695
That's it?

02:25.727 --> 02:27.063
That's it.

02:27.095 --> 02:28.530
All right.

02:28.564 --> 02:30.500
Anybody got anything else?

02:30.533 --> 02:31.368
Maggie?

02:33.268 --> 02:34.403
All right.

02:34.437 --> 02:35.272
Get outta here.

02:42.077 --> 02:43.747
Oh, David, hold up.

02:43.779 --> 02:45.380
What's up, Boss?

02:45.414 --> 02:47.450
You remember Susie Potter?

02:47.482 --> 02:48.450
Of course.

02:48.483 --> 02:51.653
Well, her mother just
passed away from cancer.

02:51.687 --> 02:54.224
She told me that she wanted
the search to continue.

02:55.158 --> 02:57.459
I'd like you to write
a nice piece on that.

02:57.493 --> 02:58.561
What are you expecting to
find?

02:58.594 --> 03:00.063
It's been like years.

03:00.095 --> 03:01.997
Well, the anniversary
is still a few months out.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.533
You got plenty of time.

03:03.565 --> 03:06.101
Don't be surprised
if no one talks to me.

03:06.135 --> 03:07.203
This is Skidmore.

03:07.236 --> 03:09.272
Well, you'll figure
it out.

03:11.273 --> 03:12.975
Hey, one more thing.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.613
I hired that friend of yours.

03:16.646 --> 03:17.446
What friend?

03:18.780 --> 03:20.182
Lisa.

03:20.215 --> 03:22.152
I want you to help her get
settled

03:22.184 --> 03:24.086
in and show her around, would
ya?

03:24.119 --> 03:25.855
I actually got a lotta work to
do.

03:25.887 --> 03:27.824
Yeah, well, it'll just take a
second.

03:33.563 --> 03:34.498
Morning, Lisa.

03:35.363 --> 03:36.165
I believe you know-

03:36.199 --> 03:37.566
- David Fremont.

03:38.534 --> 03:40.069
Lisa.

03:40.101 --> 03:42.304
I've asked David to show you
around.

03:42.338 --> 03:44.140
If you need anything
else, just let me know.

03:44.172 --> 03:45.007
Thank you.

03:52.013 --> 03:53.783
Well, it's been awhile.

03:53.815 --> 03:54.650
Yeah.

03:56.052 --> 03:57.053
How have you been?

03:58.220 --> 03:59.122
Doin' all right.

04:01.189 --> 04:02.825
I should show you around.

04:09.231 --> 04:10.332
This'll be your desk.

04:10.366 --> 04:13.269
Our last reporter was let go.

04:19.074 --> 04:20.542
Hey, Maggie?

04:20.576 --> 04:21.643
This is Lisa Johnson.

04:21.677 --> 04:22.645
She's our new reporter.

04:22.677 --> 04:23.745
Hi.

04:23.778 --> 04:24.680
It's nice to meet you.

04:24.713 --> 04:25.682
Likewise.

04:25.715 --> 04:26.750
Maggie is our news clerk,

04:26.783 --> 04:29.919
so she can help you with
whatever you need really.

04:29.951 --> 04:30.786
Good to know.

04:35.624 --> 04:37.626
Morning meeting is at nine.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.729
Copy is due by 10.

04:39.761 --> 04:41.396
Okay.

04:41.429 --> 04:42.364
Anything else?

04:43.199 --> 04:45.302
No, I think that's it.

04:48.304 --> 04:49.806
Do you wanna talk about it?

04:49.838 --> 04:52.341
Lisa, we haven't talked in
three years.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.146
I was just curious.

05:13.996 --> 05:15.999
What are you workin' on?

05:16.032 --> 05:17.867
Just preppin' for an
interview.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.003
Oo, what interview?

05:20.035 --> 05:22.372
Doing a story over the
missing Skidmore girl.

05:28.843 --> 05:30.279
When was that?

05:30.312 --> 05:31.680
Sounds familiar.

05:31.713 --> 05:33.215
10 years ago.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.618
Who are you interviewing?

05:35.484 --> 05:36.352
Her older sister.

05:36.384 --> 05:38.521
She was the last person who saw
her.

05:39.588 --> 05:41.724
Dude, you have to let me come
with you.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.425
No.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.093
No, I don't.

05:45.126 --> 05:46.261
Come on.

05:46.295 --> 05:47.830
When was the last time we
worked on a story together?

05:47.862 --> 05:49.564
Don't you have your own work
to do?

05:49.598 --> 05:52.634
Would you believe me if
I said I was already done?

05:52.667 --> 05:53.502
No.

05:56.973 --> 05:57.807
Come on.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.610
Like old times.

06:00.643 --> 06:01.912
I don't know.

06:03.078 --> 06:04.948
I can be your assistant.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.485
Any heavy lifting, I'm there.

06:09.518 --> 06:10.720
All right.

06:12.388 --> 06:13.388
Yeah?

06:13.422 --> 06:14.256
Okay.

06:16.191 --> 06:17.059
Leave in an hour.

06:29.105 --> 06:32.242
Jesus, I forgot there
is nothing out here.

06:33.109 --> 06:34.811
Like what do these people even
do?

06:35.811 --> 06:37.814
People live here so they do
somethin'.

06:38.780 --> 06:41.684
Yeah, the booming social
scene.

06:42.585 --> 06:44.087
I seem to remember you
enjoying it.

06:48.657 --> 06:50.393
What are you doin' back here,
Lisa?

06:52.561 --> 06:53.930
Maybe I just missed you.

06:56.131 --> 06:57.899
What are you really doin' back
here?

06:57.932 --> 07:00.102
Do I need a reason
to come back here now?

07:01.670 --> 07:02.838
Just out of the blue.

07:05.408 --> 07:07.744
Let's just say things didn't
work out.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.042
Hi, Diane?

07:41.076 --> 07:42.011
I'm David Fremont.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.179
We spoke on the phone earlier.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.312
This is Lisa Johnson.

07:44.345 --> 07:46.114
She works at the paper with me.

07:46.148 --> 07:46.982
May we come in?

07:48.117 --> 07:48.917
Of course.

07:48.951 --> 07:49.785
Yeah, come in.

07:54.389 --> 07:57.526
Can you tell us a
little bit about Susie?

07:58.461 --> 07:59.295
Yeah.

08:00.896 --> 08:04.232
Susie was six years younger than
me.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.035
She was just really sweet.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.702
She was really active in the
church

08:07.735 --> 08:10.572
and always helpin' people.

08:10.605 --> 08:13.076
And she disappeared
when she was 12, right?

08:13.109 --> 08:14.876
Yeah, that's right.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.779
And did she have many friends?

08:16.812 --> 08:18.881
She had a few girls
she hung around with.

08:18.913 --> 08:21.216
Do you remember their
names?

08:21.249 --> 08:23.720
Alyssa and Cassie were
her two closest friends.

08:25.187 --> 08:27.723
Do you have numbers for any of
them?

08:27.756 --> 08:28.558
Maybe.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.492
I'll see what I can find.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.360
Thank you.

08:32.194 --> 08:33.963
So, can you tell us about the
day?

08:36.665 --> 08:37.866
Sorry.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.769
It's just, it's been awhile
since I talked about all this.

08:39.801 --> 08:40.769
That's okay.

08:41.971 --> 08:42.806
Take your time.

08:44.973 --> 08:48.710
Well, I still remember
it like it was yesterday.

08:50.779 --> 08:52.014
I was gettin' ready to hang out

08:52.046 --> 08:54.916
with some friends that night and
Susie

08:54.949 --> 08:57.420
had just been hangin'
around the house all day,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.554
reading and talking on the
phone.

08:59.588 --> 09:01.857
Do you remember who she was
talking to?

09:01.891 --> 09:02.825
I'm not sure.

09:03.659 --> 09:05.862
I wasn't really paying
attention.

09:05.895 --> 09:07.362
I was gettin' ready to hop in
the shower

09:07.396 --> 09:12.135
and she was gonna run out
to my car to grab her Bible.

09:13.535 --> 09:16.138
And then when I got outta the
shower

09:16.171 --> 09:17.639
she just wasn't there.

09:19.507 --> 09:21.477
When did you tell the police?

09:21.510 --> 09:23.346
A few hours later.

09:23.378 --> 09:27.048
And where were your
parents during all of this?

09:27.082 --> 09:31.254
Mom was at work and Dad had
been gone for a few years.

09:32.688 --> 09:34.924
I looked all over for her.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.391
The front door was wide open.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.896
I looked in the car and her
Bible was gone

09:39.929 --> 09:42.497
so I know she made it at least
that far.

09:42.530 --> 09:45.066
When I couldn't find her, I
panicked.

09:45.099 --> 09:47.035
I called Mom at work.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.170
We went door to door asking

09:48.203 --> 09:50.173
if anybody had seen her and
nobody had.

09:51.774 --> 09:54.177
What do you think happened to
her?

09:54.209 --> 09:57.980
I don't know, but I know that
somebody in this town does.

09:59.848 --> 10:01.817
What makes you say that?

10:01.849 --> 10:03.519
Miss Johnson, this is
Skidmore.

10:04.652 --> 10:06.054
Everybody knows everybody.

10:06.088 --> 10:09.659
So, I can't just accept
that nobody knows anything.

10:10.858 --> 10:13.929
And then after the incident, I
knew.

10:15.164 --> 10:16.064
The incident?

10:19.734 --> 10:21.436
A year after Susie's
disappearance,

10:21.469 --> 10:25.208
these pages were in my car.

10:25.241 --> 10:26.442
They're from Susie's Bible

10:26.474 --> 10:29.077
and I know because I gave it to
her.

10:29.111 --> 10:31.213
There's a passage there
underlined that says,

10:31.247 --> 10:34.583
"No wonder, for even
Satan disguises himself

10:34.617 --> 10:36.953
as an angel of light."

10:36.986 --> 10:38.453
Did you report this?

10:38.487 --> 10:39.755
Yeah, I did.

10:39.788 --> 10:43.226
And they said that Susie
had probably done it

10:43.258 --> 10:46.895
and that the pages had just
fallen out from under the seat,

10:46.929 --> 10:49.497
but I tore that car apart
after she disappeared

10:49.530 --> 10:50.665
and they weren't there.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.303
Do you think you'll ever
find out what happened to her?

10:56.438 --> 10:58.074
You know, our mother died
believing

10:58.107 --> 11:00.108
that one day Susie'd just come
walking

11:00.141 --> 11:01.310
through the front door.

11:02.544 --> 11:04.780
Hell, I think I even
believed it for awhile,

11:06.147 --> 11:09.518
but I can feel now that she's
not alive.

11:12.154 --> 11:13.088
I just wanna know.

11:15.024 --> 11:15.857
I'm sorry.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.595
It must be very hard for you.

11:20.396 --> 11:21.197
I'm okay.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.432
It's nice to see that people
still care.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.568
And we do.

11:28.170 --> 11:29.905
Thank you for meeting with us.

11:29.938 --> 11:31.173
Yeah, thank you.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.630
Hey, so you know how Diane said

11:54.663 --> 11:56.599
that Susie was involved in the
church?

11:56.631 --> 11:57.699
Yeah.

11:57.732 --> 11:58.934
So, I called the church she
went to

11:58.967 --> 12:00.202
and the preacher there said

12:00.234 --> 12:01.636
that even though he knew Susie,

12:01.670 --> 12:02.671
she was actually closer

12:02.704 --> 12:04.506
with the youth minister and his
wife.

12:04.540 --> 12:07.476
The couple, Grace and Matthew
Donovan were really popular

12:07.508 --> 12:10.211
with the kids since they
were fresh outta college.

12:10.245 --> 12:11.080
Anything else?

12:12.448 --> 12:13.281
And he gave me their number

12:13.314 --> 12:15.950
so I'm gonna go give 'em a call.

12:15.983 --> 12:17.852
That's good work, Lis.

12:17.886 --> 12:18.721
Thanks.

12:18.753 --> 12:19.588
Hey?

12:21.189 --> 12:23.825
What do you think about
working on this officially?

12:23.858 --> 12:24.660
Really?

12:24.693 --> 12:25.494
Yeah.

12:25.526 --> 12:26.528
I'll talk to Jason about it.

12:26.561 --> 12:28.430
I mean, if you're gonna be
helping me out

12:28.463 --> 12:30.132
you might as well get some
credit.

12:31.567 --> 12:34.136
I mean, someone's gotta
pick up on your slack, right?

12:36.905 --> 12:37.740
All right.

12:54.689 --> 12:55.491
Hello?

12:55.524 --> 12:58.059
Hi, Grace, my name is Lisa
Johnson.

12:58.093 --> 12:59.661
I'm with "The Maryville Daily
Forum."

12:59.694 --> 13:00.829
I was wondering if you had some
time

13:00.862 --> 13:02.964
to answer a few questions on
Susie Potter?

13:03.966 --> 13:05.534
What kind of
questions?

13:05.567 --> 13:08.037
Well, with the anniversary
of her disappearance coming up

13:08.069 --> 13:10.573
we're doing a story on
where the case is now.

13:10.606 --> 13:12.375
We were reaching out to
those who knew her well.

13:12.407 --> 13:15.043
I understand the two of you were
close?

13:15.077 --> 13:16.511
She was a good kid.

13:17.612 --> 13:19.114
We really liked her.

13:19.147 --> 13:21.117
So, Susie was very outgoing?

13:23.017 --> 13:26.054
Susie was smart,
but she was a bit reserved.

13:27.155 --> 13:29.191
So, she mostly kept to
herself?

13:30.391 --> 13:31.893
I'd say so.

13:31.926 --> 13:32.861
Yes.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.832
And so, the two of
you were close, correct?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.968
She would talk to me.

13:40.835 --> 13:42.804
When was the last time you saw
her?

13:44.039 --> 13:46.475
A couple of days
before...

13:48.876 --> 13:49.712
Grace?

13:54.049 --> 13:54.884
Grace?

13:56.251 --> 13:57.185
Are you there?

13:59.420 --> 14:01.123
I can't talk about
this.

14:03.958 --> 14:04.794
Grace?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.562
Hello?

14:10.833 --> 14:12.267
No.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.437
There's no way I can spare
two reporters on one story.

14:15.471 --> 14:18.641
What, not enough people
covering tractor pulls?

14:18.674 --> 14:20.843
Lisa's a really good fit for
this.

14:20.876 --> 14:22.678
Then have her do the story.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.446
Is that what you want?

14:24.479 --> 14:25.814
You know, it's not a bad idea.

14:25.848 --> 14:28.150
David, I assigned you this
story.

14:29.150 --> 14:30.953
I don't wanna hear about this
again.

14:33.689 --> 14:34.524
Okay.

14:42.897 --> 14:44.432
So am I on the story?

14:44.466 --> 14:45.301
No.

14:47.803 --> 14:48.804
Why not?

14:48.838 --> 14:51.140
He says he
can't spare the reporters.

14:51.173 --> 14:54.176
So, if you don't wanna
help anymore, I understand.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.010
It's a good thing quitting

14:55.043 --> 14:56.813
isn't one of my strong suits.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.915
You'll have to work on
this on your own time.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.651
You get ahold of the Donovan's?

15:03.852 --> 15:04.920
Yeah.

15:04.953 --> 15:08.057
Got ahold of Grace and she hung
up on me.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.626
Think we could be onto
something?

15:12.527 --> 15:13.928
Maybe.

16:19.160 --> 16:19.996
Hey!

16:21.796 --> 16:23.098
Nobody lives there.

16:25.968 --> 16:27.270
Yeah, it looks that way.

16:28.102 --> 16:29.872
You shouldn't be trespassing.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.939
You could be shot.

16:32.107 --> 16:34.376
Wouldn't be the first
time that's happened here.

16:35.376 --> 16:37.146
Well, you should be more
careful.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.715
I will.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.120
Do you know who used to live
here?

16:45.152 --> 16:49.391
Young guy and his wife
I think,

16:49.424 --> 16:50.927
but that was a long time ago.

16:52.126 --> 16:54.697
Do you remember a
disappearance

16:54.729 --> 16:56.798
that happened about a decade
ago?

16:58.065 --> 16:59.334
That Potter girl?

17:00.202 --> 17:01.070
Yeah.

17:02.003 --> 17:03.304
Could you point me in the
direction

17:03.338 --> 17:05.241
of where the Potter girl used to
live?

17:06.642 --> 17:08.244
Down there on the left.

17:09.677 --> 17:10.512
Thank you.

17:12.213 --> 17:13.315
Have a good day.

18:52.748 --> 18:54.350
You look like shit.

18:57.085 --> 18:58.453
What are you doin' here?

18:58.486 --> 19:00.790
We were supposed to
meet up about the story.

19:01.956 --> 19:03.257
Oh, right.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.559
It's like eight o'clock.

19:04.592 --> 19:06.461
Why did you come so early?

19:06.494 --> 19:09.064
Because you said to meet in
the morning,

19:10.464 --> 19:11.567
and it is morning.

19:13.734 --> 19:15.737
I'm sorry, it's just, I got
company.

19:15.771 --> 19:17.239
I have breakfast.

19:20.474 --> 19:22.444
Is everything okay out here?

19:22.476 --> 19:23.778
Yeah, it's fine.

19:23.811 --> 19:26.180
I just got a story to
work on I forgot about.

19:26.213 --> 19:27.049
Oh.

19:28.683 --> 19:29.952
Hey, Maggie.

19:29.984 --> 19:30.819
Hey.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.521
I'll just be a few minutes.

19:33.555 --> 19:34.390
Cool.

19:38.159 --> 19:38.993
What?

19:40.962 --> 19:41.797
Nothing.

19:42.864 --> 19:43.699
Whatever.

19:44.765 --> 19:48.002
Hey, just let her down easy,
okay?

19:48.036 --> 19:50.206
Hm, 'cause you're so good at
that.

19:57.913 --> 19:59.213
So, what do you got?

19:59.246 --> 20:02.683
Those pictures I sent you
last night, did you see 'em?

20:02.716 --> 20:04.552
I did, at work.

20:05.486 --> 20:08.956
You know, Skidmore is
a creepy fucking place.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.526
What makes you say that?

20:10.559 --> 20:11.993
I mean, apart from all the
shit

20:12.027 --> 20:13.863
that's happened there over the
years?

20:15.463 --> 20:16.498
I don't know.

20:16.530 --> 20:17.832
I just felt like someone
was watching me yesterday.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.233
Nah, don't be
paranoid.

20:19.267 --> 20:20.068
No one's watching you.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.869
I'm not being paranoid.

20:21.903 --> 20:23.405
I'm just saying it felt weird.

20:24.371 --> 20:25.340
It'll be fine.

20:27.075 --> 20:27.876
So, what's next?

20:29.310 --> 20:31.012
It's your story, you tell me.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.149
Guess let's go knock on some
doors?

20:38.552 --> 20:41.322
Hi, I'm a reporter from
"The Maryville Daily Forum."

20:41.356 --> 20:42.424
I was wondering if you could-

20:43.791 --> 20:45.793
Hi, I'm from "The
Maryville Daily Forum."

20:45.827 --> 20:48.830
I was wondering if I could,
just go to another house?

20:51.867 --> 20:53.702
- Hi, I'm a reporter-
- Get lost.

21:00.341 --> 21:01.142
Any luck?

21:01.175 --> 21:03.412
No, dude.

21:03.444 --> 21:05.280
I feel like a freakin' Jehovah's
Witness.

21:05.312 --> 21:06.881
Yeah, I thought small town
people

21:06.915 --> 21:08.317
are supposed to be friendly.

21:08.349 --> 21:09.184
Not here.

21:10.050 --> 21:12.588
Well, let's hit the next one.

21:23.530 --> 21:24.331
Hello, Ma'am.

21:24.365 --> 21:25.800
We're here to spread the Word of
God.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.937
Have you given your heart to
Jesus Christ?

21:28.970 --> 21:31.173
You're not here to
spread the Word of God.

21:33.407 --> 21:36.144
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

21:36.176 --> 21:37.945
We're actually reporters
from "The Maryville-"

21:37.979 --> 21:39.581
Everybody knows who you two
are.

21:39.614 --> 21:40.816
You're just like all the others
who come

21:40.848 --> 21:43.085
around here wantin' to
know who shot the bully?

21:43.117 --> 21:43.918
Oh, no.

21:43.952 --> 21:45.453
We're not here to talk about
McElroy.

21:45.486 --> 21:47.455
We're here to talk about Susie.

21:47.489 --> 21:49.658
Nobody wants to talk
about that girl either.

21:49.691 --> 21:51.126
Well, we're doin' a story on
her.

21:51.158 --> 21:53.060
We're not meaning to upset
anyone.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.296
Well, it is upsetting.

21:54.328 --> 21:56.030
What did you expect?

21:56.063 --> 21:57.798
We spoke with Susie's
sister the other day

21:57.831 --> 21:59.700
and she was very open about it.

21:59.733 --> 22:01.369
That Potter woman won't move
on.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.405
The rest of us would rather
just get on with our lives.

22:04.438 --> 22:06.641
So you don't wanna find
out what happened to her?

22:06.675 --> 22:07.975
Nothing can be done.

22:08.009 --> 22:09.812
Do us a favor and leave this
alone.

22:41.175 --> 22:41.976
Miss Johnson?

22:42.010 --> 22:42.810
Yeah, Boss?

22:42.844 --> 22:44.546
I need your copy.

22:44.578 --> 22:45.681
Yeah, it's done.

22:45.713 --> 22:48.517
I've just gotta type it up real
quick.

22:48.550 --> 22:50.452
It's not done unless it's
typed.

22:51.353 --> 22:53.489
Sorry, I will get
that to you right away.

22:54.455 --> 22:56.457
Listen, this is the real
world,

22:56.491 --> 22:58.760
not your school paper, okay?

22:58.792 --> 22:59.627
Gotcha.

23:00.595 --> 23:02.498
Right away, Sir.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.302
Do you wanna
pull records to start off?

23:07.335 --> 23:08.170
Hey?

23:10.271 --> 23:11.106
You okay?

23:13.308 --> 23:14.309
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:16.344 --> 23:17.813
What time is it?

23:20.415 --> 23:22.084
It's time to go.

23:22.117 --> 23:23.719
You wanna grab a drink?

23:25.119 --> 23:27.822
Won't your girlfriend be
jealous?

23:27.856 --> 23:29.223
Look, you want to or not?

23:44.806 --> 23:47.209
You're not much of a housekeeper
are ya?

23:49.043 --> 23:50.244
Let's get you over here.

23:59.686 --> 24:00.488
Hey?

24:00.521 --> 24:01.357
Hey.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.828
Goodnight, buddy.

24:07.861 --> 24:08.662
Goodnight.

27:37.605 --> 27:38.440
Are you alone?

27:41.276 --> 27:42.110
Yeah.

27:43.744 --> 27:44.579
Who are you?

27:45.879 --> 27:47.448
That's not important,

27:47.482 --> 27:50.684
but I am putting myself
in danger by meeting you.

27:50.717 --> 27:52.620
Why do you say that?

27:52.654 --> 27:55.957
Another case, one connected to
Susie's.

27:55.990 --> 27:56.825
What case?

27:59.327 --> 28:03.232
A murder in North County,
a young girl, Jessica Mercer.

28:04.165 --> 28:05.700
And what does
that have to do with Susie?

28:05.732 --> 28:07.269
That's for you to figure out.

28:10.070 --> 28:11.339
Why are you helping us?

28:12.572 --> 28:15.276
Because no one else would.

28:16.644 --> 28:18.113
Wait, how do I contact
you?

28:18.146 --> 28:19.013
I'll find you.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.963
Little Lisa Johnson, is that
you?

28:35.829 --> 28:37.198
Raymond, hey.

28:38.866 --> 28:40.367
What are you doin' here?

28:40.401 --> 28:41.936
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.

28:41.969 --> 28:44.572
Figured I'd look you
up, buy you some supper.

28:44.605 --> 28:45.640
Hm.

28:45.673 --> 28:48.343
Well, it is about that time.

28:48.376 --> 28:49.176
Why not?

28:49.210 --> 28:50.377
All right.

28:53.614 --> 28:55.550
Well, your dad still comes by
every once

28:55.582 --> 28:58.118
in awhile to drink coffee and
bullshit

28:58.152 --> 28:59.588
with the rest of us old guys.

29:00.988 --> 29:03.558
Oh, yeah, that sounds like
Dad.

29:03.590 --> 29:06.394
So what are you doing
all the way over here?

29:06.426 --> 29:08.362
It's for work.

29:08.396 --> 29:09.630
Where do you work?

29:09.664 --> 29:10.898
The Maryville paper.

29:11.866 --> 29:12.800
Well, I haven't heard

29:12.834 --> 29:15.437
of anything interesting
happening over here.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.704
It's nothing new.

29:16.738 --> 29:19.741
It's actually an older case,

29:20.707 --> 29:23.978
one that I think you helped
investigate.

29:25.613 --> 29:27.783
I thought this was
just a friendly visit?

29:31.786 --> 29:32.587
Look, I'm sorry.

29:32.619 --> 29:33.521
It's just,

29:37.724 --> 29:38.626
I need your help.

29:39.894 --> 29:40.729
How?

29:42.730 --> 29:43.831
I was wondering if you
could tell me anything

29:43.865 --> 29:46.867
about the Mercer girl who
was murdered back in '05?

29:46.901 --> 29:49.971
Now why do you wanna know
about that awful thing?

29:50.003 --> 29:51.905
Because I was told that
there might be a connection

29:51.938 --> 29:53.340
with a missing girl case that
happened

29:53.374 --> 29:55.410
in Skidmore a few years later.

29:55.443 --> 29:56.911
No, they wouldn't be related.

29:56.944 --> 29:59.280
We convicted someone for the
Mercer case.

30:01.816 --> 30:04.953
Is there anything, anything at
all?

30:07.655 --> 30:09.290
I shouldn't be talkin'
to you about this.

30:09.322 --> 30:10.290
But why not?

30:10.323 --> 30:11.759
Because you're a reporter.

30:13.461 --> 30:15.530
I am just an old friend

30:16.731 --> 30:18.232
who you're having supper with,

30:19.533 --> 30:20.601
and that's all.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.610
This has to be off the record.

30:31.145 --> 30:33.615
Ed Henry, a real low
life in the community,

30:33.647 --> 30:36.617
had run ins with local law
enforcements his entire life.

30:36.651 --> 30:38.019
He was charged with the murder.

30:38.051 --> 30:39.920
Yeah, so what?

30:39.953 --> 30:41.088
It's not exactly a secret.

30:41.121 --> 30:42.856
It's all public record.

30:42.889 --> 30:44.559
Yeah, but he denied
committing the murder.

30:44.591 --> 30:47.628
What murderer
hasn't done that before?

30:47.662 --> 30:49.364
What's this have to do with
Susie?

30:50.298 --> 30:51.133
I don't know.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.935
Well, do you wanna talk to
him?

30:54.969 --> 30:56.203
That's gonna be difficult.

30:56.236 --> 30:57.037
Why is that?

30:57.070 --> 30:57.905
He's dead.

30:59.473 --> 31:01.775
Yeah, that would make it
difficult.

31:01.809 --> 31:04.011
Raymond said that Ed
hung himself and left

31:04.044 --> 31:05.579
a suicide note continuing to
deny

31:05.613 --> 31:07.816
he had anything to do with the
murder.

31:07.848 --> 31:11.019
His suicide and that note
were never made public record.

31:12.419 --> 31:13.787
So, you think he's innocent?

31:13.820 --> 31:14.688
I think it's awfully
convenient

31:14.722 --> 31:16.724
to point the finger at the town
lowlife.

31:18.725 --> 31:19.560
Who knows?

31:21.294 --> 31:22.663
Maybe he was telling the truth.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.476
So you know Raymond, huh?

31:34.509 --> 31:37.011
Yeah, he's an old friend of
the family.

31:37.043 --> 31:39.513
Well, I owe my life to that
man.

31:41.382 --> 31:46.387
Wouldn't be stumbling around
here if it weren't for him.

31:46.419 --> 31:47.221
Thank you.

31:47.254 --> 31:48.021
Thank you.

31:53.027 --> 31:54.896
He mentioned you were lead
detective

31:54.928 --> 31:56.964
in North County until your
accident.

31:56.998 --> 31:57.833
Yeah.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.236
Wish I could have done more.

32:03.703 --> 32:06.406
So tell me, what is it
you kids want again?

32:06.440 --> 32:08.343
Raymond thought you might
remember

32:08.376 --> 32:10.878
some details from a certain
case.

32:10.912 --> 32:12.981
What case would that be?

32:13.013 --> 32:14.616
Jessica Mercer.

32:14.648 --> 32:16.251
That's a closed case now.

32:16.283 --> 32:18.719
You can find everything
you need in public records.

32:18.752 --> 32:21.155
I heard not everything
was made public record.

32:22.589 --> 32:24.791
So what do you know?

32:24.825 --> 32:26.728
What can you tell us about Ed
Henry?

32:29.696 --> 32:31.765
The only evidence we had
pointed to Ed,

32:33.701 --> 32:36.304
but that never sat well with me.

32:36.337 --> 32:37.438
Why is that?

32:37.471 --> 32:39.741
I guess you'd never
had

32:39.773 --> 32:41.775
the pleasure of meeting Ed
Henry.

32:41.809 --> 32:43.011
No.

32:43.043 --> 32:45.713
There were no fingerprints,
DNA, hair,

32:47.248 --> 32:48.516
nothing on that girl.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.718
No evidence other than Ed's
truck

32:50.751 --> 32:52.186
was found at the crime scene.

32:53.421 --> 32:55.823
Now, you can't tell me that a
kid

32:55.856 --> 32:57.759
who couldn't even graduate high
school

32:58.693 --> 33:00.060
could leave a crime scene that
spotless.

33:02.062 --> 33:04.131
So, why was he convicted?

33:04.165 --> 33:05.732
Are you from a small town?

33:05.765 --> 33:06.567
Yeah.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.468
Then you should know the
politics

33:08.501 --> 33:10.370
behind a situation like this.

33:10.404 --> 33:11.673
The Henry's had more enemies

33:11.705 --> 33:13.808
than track marks down their
backs.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.511
So, who do you think could
have done it?

33:17.544 --> 33:18.379
I don't know.

33:21.147 --> 33:23.350
But what was done to that girl,

33:23.384 --> 33:25.487
I hope I never see anything like
it again.

33:26.553 --> 33:29.990
This was something more
monstrous.

33:31.192 --> 33:32.794
How so?

33:32.827 --> 33:35.530
This was never released to the
public.

33:35.562 --> 33:39.568
Whoever murdered that girl
didn't have sex with her.

33:42.369 --> 33:43.604
They used a corncob.

33:51.011 --> 33:54.081
Did you know Jessica at all?

33:54.115 --> 33:54.950
Not really.

33:55.884 --> 33:58.653
Just that she was a normal,
quiet girl,

33:58.685 --> 34:00.253
good in school.

34:00.287 --> 34:01.456
Pastor at Sheridan had nothing

34:01.489 --> 34:03.524
but great things to say about
her.

34:03.557 --> 34:04.592
Wait, her pastor?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.560
Do you mean Matthew Donovan?

34:06.594 --> 34:07.629
Yeah, that's him.

34:08.595 --> 34:10.731
Matt's helped me through a lot.

34:14.301 --> 34:18.473
I've heard stories of
men who have lost faith

34:18.506 --> 34:22.210
coming face to face with evil
like that.

34:25.513 --> 34:26.348
But for me,

34:28.548 --> 34:29.617
I wanted to believe.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.322
I had to believe there was a
hell,

34:35.222 --> 34:39.227
and that whoever did that was
going there.

34:49.870 --> 34:50.705
Hello?

34:51.738 --> 34:52.572
Hello there.

34:52.606 --> 34:54.641
I'm David, this is my partner,
Lisa.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.310
We're from "The Maryville Daily
Forum."

34:57.343 --> 34:58.979
Oh, it's nice to meet you
guys.

34:59.914 --> 35:00.749
I'm Matthew.

35:02.115 --> 35:03.283
I'm the pastor here.

35:03.316 --> 35:04.117
It's nice to meet you.

35:04.151 --> 35:05.553
Hi.

35:05.586 --> 35:08.189
Tom Trullinger sent us your
way.

35:08.222 --> 35:09.189
Oh yeah, Tommy?

35:10.356 --> 35:12.059
You guys ever seen Tom play the
guitar?

35:12.093 --> 35:14.194
That dude is amazing.

35:14.227 --> 35:15.796
Is this about him?

35:16.796 --> 35:18.165
Unfortunately, no.

35:18.198 --> 35:20.769
We're actually doing a
story on Susie Potter.

35:22.403 --> 35:24.772
Well, that's unfortunate.

35:24.805 --> 35:26.908
Susie was an amazing person.

35:26.941 --> 35:29.343
She was an active member
of my youth group.

35:29.376 --> 35:32.013
So eager to learn and be closer
to God.

35:33.314 --> 35:35.316
Everybody around here loved her.

35:35.348 --> 35:38.318
We were told that this
wasn't the first tragedy

35:38.352 --> 35:40.555
your youth group suffered.

35:40.588 --> 35:41.890
Unfortunately it's not.

35:43.758 --> 35:45.727
We had a young lady that
attended this church,

35:45.760 --> 35:48.430
and she was taken from us.

35:50.131 --> 35:52.165
Did you know Jessica Mercer
well?

35:52.198 --> 35:53.533
Of course.

35:53.566 --> 35:55.702
Jessica was in our older group.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.205
She was 15.

35:58.506 --> 36:01.609
A lot of the younger girls
really looked up to her.

36:01.642 --> 36:04.611
You and your wife were the
last ones to see her, right?

36:04.644 --> 36:06.347
That's correct, we were,

36:06.379 --> 36:09.015
but Grace and I are no longer
together.

36:09.048 --> 36:11.251
I'm sorry, we were unaware.

36:11.285 --> 36:13.120
It's not a problem.

36:13.153 --> 36:15.021
Jessica had attended our youth
group

36:15.055 --> 36:16.658
the evening she went missing.

36:18.225 --> 36:20.995
I found out the next day
what happened and...

36:28.368 --> 36:32.207
It's the only time I came
close to doubting my faith.

36:35.575 --> 36:38.378
It was extremely hard when I
saw what it did to my wife.

36:41.515 --> 36:44.018
I had a difficult time
preaching with the same joy

36:45.285 --> 36:47.856
because I felt God had made
a mistake with Jessica.

36:52.392 --> 36:55.228
Well, we contacted your
ex-wife

36:55.261 --> 37:00.234
awhile back and she wasn't
too keen to talk about Susie.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.169
Well, she loved those kids.

37:03.437 --> 37:06.440
And after she found out
that she wasn't able

37:06.472 --> 37:08.242
to conceive children of her own,

37:09.843 --> 37:12.312
our kids here were our family.

37:17.017 --> 37:17.819
I'm sorry, guys.

37:17.852 --> 37:18.685
I...

37:20.754 --> 37:21.956
You know, this might be the
first time

37:21.988 --> 37:23.323
you hear a preacher say this,

37:23.356 --> 37:26.660
but I just don't feel like
talking.

37:27.727 --> 37:28.562
We understand.

37:30.064 --> 37:31.065
Appreciate the help.

37:32.098 --> 37:33.334
It's no problem at all.

37:34.401 --> 37:37.038
Feel free to come back to
one of our services sometime.

37:38.205 --> 37:39.040
Thanks.

37:44.812 --> 37:46.113
It has been five years to the
day

37:46.146 --> 37:48.249
since the mysterious
disappearance of Susie Potter,

37:48.281 --> 37:50.117
and the family continues to
search

37:50.149 --> 37:52.419
and remains optimistic she'll be
found.

37:52.452 --> 37:55.288
We spoke with Susie's
mother about the search.

37:55.321 --> 37:57.258
Any information would be
helpful.

37:58.225 --> 37:59.193
If someone knows something

37:59.225 --> 38:02.495
and then wanna remain
anonymous, that's fine.

38:02.528 --> 38:04.631
We just want our little girl
back.

38:52.111 --> 38:54.481
David confessed to me that all
his life,

38:54.515 --> 38:56.484
he wants to be like Jason.

38:56.517 --> 38:58.319
- Like, Jason?
- What?

38:59.653 --> 39:00.788
- Why?
- I don't know.

39:00.821 --> 39:02.323
What are you guys laughin' at?

39:04.624 --> 39:06.426
I'll talk to you later.

39:06.459 --> 39:07.528
See you, Maggie.

39:11.164 --> 39:12.266
What'd you tell her?

39:13.100 --> 39:14.735
None of your business.

39:14.767 --> 39:15.735
Talkin' about me?

39:15.769 --> 39:17.972
Oh, I hate to break it to you,
Peaches,

39:18.004 --> 39:20.441
but not everything is about you.

39:20.473 --> 39:23.443
Isn't it?

39:26.446 --> 39:27.414
"Maryville Daily Forum."

39:27.448 --> 39:28.816
This is David.

39:28.848 --> 39:30.184
Are you the
guy who's been lookin'

39:30.216 --> 39:31.419
into some old cases?

39:32.519 --> 39:35.089
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's me.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.390
Who is this?

39:36.423 --> 39:37.792
Just meet me in the alley

39:37.825 --> 39:40.060
on the east side of the square
at nine.

39:40.093 --> 39:41.095
I'll be lookin' for you.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.816
Think he's gonna show?

40:01.848 --> 40:03.517
No.

40:03.550 --> 40:05.319
Don't even know what he looks
like.

40:06.854 --> 40:09.122
So, you think he's
the Zodiac?

40:09.156 --> 40:11.826
You think everyone's the
Zodiac.

40:11.859 --> 40:14.761
Only people that are
left-handed.

40:28.742 --> 40:30.310
You David?

40:31.477 --> 40:32.780
Yeah, me and my partner.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.482
This is her.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.750
Can she join us?

40:39.486 --> 40:40.388
Who are you?

40:43.323 --> 40:45.493
My brother didn't do
it.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.095
He was a lotta things,
but he wasn't a murderer.

40:48.127 --> 40:49.263
How do you know this?

40:50.464 --> 40:51.866
They were together.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.601
She was a minor.

40:54.635 --> 40:56.037
She used to drive his truck
around town.

40:56.069 --> 40:57.303
You could ask anyone.

40:57.336 --> 41:00.273
This is great information,
but it doesn't prove anything.

41:02.276 --> 41:03.877
Listen, I know who did
it.

41:03.910 --> 41:04.745
Okay.

41:05.646 --> 41:06.881
It's all right.

41:08.048 --> 41:08.848
Take it easy.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.057
Who did it?

41:18.191 --> 41:19.226
Mr. Darrach.

41:21.894 --> 41:22.963
He used to touch her.

41:24.631 --> 41:26.466
Wait, how do you know this?

41:26.499 --> 41:28.068
Jess told Ed.

41:28.102 --> 41:29.170
Ed knew it was Darrach.

41:29.202 --> 41:30.804
But she never said it was him?

41:31.671 --> 41:33.240
She was scared.

41:33.272 --> 41:34.774
Does anyone else know about
this?

41:34.807 --> 41:37.210
He didn't want
anyone else to know.

41:37.243 --> 41:38.646
Why wouldn't he tell the
police?

41:38.678 --> 41:39.646
He did.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.182
They didn't do anything.

41:43.484 --> 41:45.019
Do you know where Darrach is
now?

41:45.051 --> 41:46.486
No, he skipped town.

41:48.321 --> 41:51.959
Find him, look him up, you'll
see.

41:57.430 --> 41:58.432
Do you believe that guy?

41:58.464 --> 42:00.200
I don't know.

42:01.234 --> 42:02.035
Maybe.

42:02.068 --> 42:03.169
Did you look at him?

42:03.202 --> 42:04.304
So what, we shouldn't follow
up

42:04.338 --> 42:06.406
on this lead he just gave us?

42:06.439 --> 42:08.675
I just think we should
be careful about this.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.944
Why, because he looks like a
stoner?

42:10.977 --> 42:12.046
I just don't want you goin'
off

42:12.078 --> 42:14.481
on this Darrach guy because
you think he's guilty.

42:14.515 --> 42:16.884
Yeah, and I don't want
you going soft on him.

42:19.118 --> 42:20.421
Let's just ease into it.

42:23.957 --> 42:24.792
Are you okay?

42:26.760 --> 42:27.595
I'm fine.

42:29.696 --> 42:30.598
You can tell me.

42:34.568 --> 42:36.236
Let's just get outta here,
okay?

42:43.377 --> 42:47.815
Okay, so Darrach taught
here in North County.

42:47.847 --> 42:49.816
That's where Jessica
Mercer went to school.

42:49.850 --> 42:52.353
That's right, and then
five days after her murder,

42:53.519 --> 42:54.354
he moved here.

42:56.122 --> 42:56.957
Shit.

42:58.559 --> 42:59.694
Wanna go talk to him?

43:00.560 --> 43:01.495
Yeah, I think so.

43:22.015 --> 43:22.984
Do I know you?

43:25.452 --> 43:26.287
Maybe.

43:27.287 --> 43:28.222
Oh, yeah.

43:28.254 --> 43:31.024
It was right before
Thanksgiving.

43:31.057 --> 43:32.559
I was walkin' my dog, Charlie.

43:33.493 --> 43:34.328
That's right.

43:35.394 --> 43:37.964
You wouldn't happen to be
Jeff Darrach, would you?

43:37.997 --> 43:39.532
Yeah.

43:39.566 --> 43:40.968
Well, what can I do for ya?

43:41.001 --> 43:43.336
We just wanted to
ask you a few questions

43:43.370 --> 43:45.640
on a former student of
yours, Jessica Mercer.

43:47.307 --> 43:48.642
Okay. Yeah.

43:48.675 --> 43:49.508
Come on in.

43:49.542 --> 43:50.810
Come on in, it's too cold to be
outside.

43:56.249 --> 43:57.083
Have a seat.

44:03.856 --> 44:05.258
Would you like some tea?

44:05.292 --> 44:06.427
- No, thank you.
- No.

44:27.013 --> 44:29.749
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your
names?

44:29.783 --> 44:30.818
Well, I'm David.

44:30.850 --> 44:32.619
This is Lisa.

44:32.653 --> 44:33.486
We're reporters.

44:36.156 --> 44:38.025
Lisa, I've got an apology for
you.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.161
For what?

44:41.193 --> 44:44.731
When I yelled at ya
that other time I saw ya,

44:44.765 --> 44:48.368
it's just that the folks around
here get real uncomfortable

44:48.401 --> 44:51.438
when strangers come nosying
around.

44:55.242 --> 44:57.477
I just didn't wanna see ya get
hurt.

45:00.714 --> 45:01.549
That's fine.

45:03.082 --> 45:04.484
So, what can I do for you?

45:05.452 --> 45:06.720
Well, we were just wondering

45:06.752 --> 45:08.856
if you could tell us about
Jessica Mercer?

45:09.756 --> 45:11.658
What do you wanna know?

45:11.691 --> 45:13.159
Did you know her well?

45:13.193 --> 45:16.263
Yeah, and I consider
it a distinct privilege.

45:17.164 --> 45:19.267
She was absolutely brilliant

45:20.533 --> 45:21.834
and she was even more beautiful.

45:21.868 --> 45:24.071
You've probably seen her
pictures.

45:24.104 --> 45:26.506
I mean, that was a beautiful
girl.

45:29.975 --> 45:31.211
She's gone now.

45:32.611 --> 45:35.649
It was a tragedy, but she's with
God now.

45:40.519 --> 45:42.522
Did you know Susie Potter?

45:42.555 --> 45:47.493
Ah, I thought we were
here to talk about Jessica.

45:47.526 --> 45:48.694
Oh, we are.

45:48.727 --> 45:51.432
But we were hopin' that we
could talk about both of them.

45:52.265 --> 45:54.768
Yeah, I taught both the girls.

45:54.801 --> 45:59.140
In fact, I lived next door
to the Potters' for awhile.

46:00.673 --> 46:04.043
Did you live next door to
her the day she disappeared?

46:04.077 --> 46:04.912
Yeah.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.214
That was a terrible day.

46:08.247 --> 46:10.883
Her mom and sister came over in
a panic.

46:10.917 --> 46:12.986
I spent almost the whole night
helping

46:13.019 --> 46:14.354
them try and find her.

46:14.388 --> 46:16.557
The whole town turned out to
help.

46:16.589 --> 46:18.792
Had you seen her earlier that
day?

46:18.825 --> 46:19.693
Yeah, yeah.

46:19.725 --> 46:22.028
We had a tutoring session in the
morning

46:23.897 --> 46:28.035
and saw her later that night.

46:30.803 --> 46:32.238
She come over often?

46:32.272 --> 46:33.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:33.472 --> 46:36.409
She came over for school stuff
and then

46:36.443 --> 46:39.113
if her mom or sister
needed to go someplace,

46:39.146 --> 46:40.113
I'd actually watch her.

46:42.515 --> 46:44.517
What's all this about?

46:44.551 --> 46:45.352
We've just heard there's

46:45.385 --> 46:47.521
a connection between both of
'em.

46:47.553 --> 46:49.589
What connection would that be?

46:49.622 --> 46:52.358
We were hoping you could tell
us that.

46:52.392 --> 46:54.194
I'm not sure what you mean.

46:54.227 --> 46:55.696
You tell me.

46:55.729 --> 46:57.497
What are you implying?

46:57.531 --> 46:58.799
Days after Jessica's murder,

46:58.832 --> 47:01.734
you resigned from North
County R-3 and moved here.

47:01.767 --> 47:02.568
Why?

47:02.602 --> 47:03.636
To take another job.

47:03.669 --> 47:05.539
Is that some kind of crime?

47:05.571 --> 47:07.774
We just wanna know what
happened.

47:07.807 --> 47:10.443
I just don't understand
what this is all about.

47:10.477 --> 47:12.713
Look, I mean, I'm very sorry

47:12.745 --> 47:14.046
for what happened to those
girls.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.517
It was a tragedy but that
has absolutely nothin'

47:16.550 --> 47:17.385
to do with me.

47:19.352 --> 47:20.988
Did you ever touch any of your
students?

47:21.021 --> 47:22.656
- Excuse me?
- Lisa!

47:22.689 --> 47:23.524
Look, Sir, I'm really sorry,
Sir.

47:23.557 --> 47:25.591
I'm talkin' to her, not to
you.

47:25.624 --> 47:27.593
A source of ours says
you abused Jessica.

47:27.627 --> 47:28.462
Is that true?

47:30.363 --> 47:31.866
Get out of my house.

47:33.732 --> 47:34.635
Just answer the question.

47:34.667 --> 47:35.702
I said get out!

47:35.736 --> 47:38.472
Get your fucking hands
off me you piece of shit.

47:38.504 --> 47:39.472
Lisa!

47:39.506 --> 47:40.341
I, I...

47:41.240 --> 47:42.075
Hey!

47:44.243 --> 47:45.278
What the hell was that?

47:45.312 --> 47:47.114
I'm so sick of this shit.

47:47.147 --> 47:47.948
You're sick of what?

47:47.981 --> 47:49.116
He's lying to us.

47:49.149 --> 47:50.784
He knows exactly what happened.

47:50.816 --> 47:52.952
Well, that may be true,
but you can't act like that.

47:52.986 --> 47:54.721
Now he's never gonna talk to us.

47:54.754 --> 47:56.256
You have to learn to play nice.

47:56.289 --> 47:59.225
Yeah, even if he's a
pedophile and a killer?

47:59.258 --> 48:00.126
Unfortunately.

48:01.060 --> 48:02.361
Look, I get it.

48:02.394 --> 48:04.564
It's difficult, but this is our
job.

48:06.365 --> 48:07.200
Yeah, I know.

48:09.435 --> 48:10.271
Come on.

48:11.338 --> 48:13.207
I think I know someone we
can talk to about this.

48:17.243 --> 48:18.479
Jeff Darrach.

48:19.778 --> 48:21.280
Are you sure?

48:21.314 --> 48:22.716
Not enough to go to print.

48:23.617 --> 48:26.819
Has anyone
confronted Jeff about this?

48:26.852 --> 48:29.289
Let's just say he was
less than forthcoming.

48:34.794 --> 48:36.497
This could really change
things.

48:39.798 --> 48:41.001
Mr. Donovan?

48:49.109 --> 48:50.143
Jessica told me something

48:50.176 --> 48:51.946
a few days before she was
murdered.

48:52.912 --> 48:53.914
It was difficult for her to talk

48:53.946 --> 48:56.517
about because she was quite
distraught.

48:57.883 --> 48:59.986
And what did she tell you?

49:00.019 --> 49:02.054
Well, she didn't come
right out and say it,

49:02.088 --> 49:04.124
but I was under the impression

49:04.156 --> 49:06.626
that she had been taken
advantage of.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.662
Do you think it could have
been Darrach?

49:09.696 --> 49:11.231
I don't know.

49:11.263 --> 49:14.300
She wouldn't tell me what
happened.

49:14.334 --> 49:18.239
She just kept saying that she
hoped God would forgive her.

49:19.638 --> 49:21.274
Did you tell anyone about
this?

49:22.309 --> 49:24.444
Her mother and stepfather.

49:24.477 --> 49:26.713
And how'd they react?

49:26.745 --> 49:28.648
Not well.

49:28.682 --> 49:30.651
I told them to tell the
authorities right away

49:30.684 --> 49:31.852
or I would do it.

49:32.952 --> 49:34.554
They said they would follow
through,

49:34.588 --> 49:37.457
but Jessica was from a broken
home

49:38.390 --> 49:41.628
and abuse was commonplace.

49:44.430 --> 49:46.733
A few days later they found her
body.

49:49.202 --> 49:50.671
Were you questioned?

49:50.703 --> 49:51.972
By the police?

49:52.004 --> 49:53.339
Yes.

49:53.372 --> 49:54.173
Grace and I did everything

49:54.207 --> 49:56.343
we could to help the
investigation.

49:56.376 --> 49:59.111
And you always assumed the
abuser was?

49:59.144 --> 50:01.247
It could have been any number
of people.

50:03.115 --> 50:05.518
When they arrested Ed
Henry for the murder...

50:12.492 --> 50:13.493
Look, we're sorry.

50:14.361 --> 50:16.263
We've taken enough of your time.

50:18.497 --> 50:19.800
We can show ourselves out.

50:24.571 --> 50:25.839
There's something else.

50:29.075 --> 50:30.743
You'll wanna talk to Mike
Lambert.

50:31.678 --> 50:32.713
He found her body.

50:35.015 --> 50:36.817
His story might make more sense
now.

50:39.419 --> 50:43.089
Well, it was early, still dark
out.

50:43.122 --> 50:45.858
The fall calves were
just startin' to come in

50:45.892 --> 50:48.895
and that's when I heard a truck
pull up

50:48.928 --> 50:51.699
a couple hundred yards
away right over there.

50:52.765 --> 50:54.667
And that's where you
saw Ed dump the body?

50:54.700 --> 50:56.736
Well, I never said that.

50:57.736 --> 51:00.206
It was Ed's truck all right,

51:00.240 --> 51:02.442
but I didn't say it was him.

51:02.475 --> 51:05.979
So, you saw someone dump
a body out of Ed's truck?

51:06.011 --> 51:09.182
Yeah, but I didn't know that
it was a body at the time.

51:10.716 --> 51:15.722
Okay, so you saw an
unknown figure dump something

51:16.089 --> 51:17.190
out of the back of Ed's truck?

51:17.222 --> 51:19.325
Do you know who it was?

51:19.359 --> 51:20.561
I don't know.

51:21.493 --> 51:24.664
But you testified in court
that it wasn't Ed, right?

51:24.698 --> 51:25.531
That's right.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.968
You couldn't miss Ed Henry.

51:29.002 --> 51:31.104
Not even from that distance.

51:31.136 --> 51:33.406
He was a big son of a bitch.

51:33.439 --> 51:36.008
And whoever dropped the body
was?

51:36.042 --> 51:37.577
Much smaller.

51:37.609 --> 51:39.445
So, what happened?

51:39.479 --> 51:42.082
Well, those lawyers,

51:42.115 --> 51:44.584
they made sure that the
jury didn't believe me.

51:46.185 --> 51:48.856
Even tested my eyes right
there in the courtroom,

51:50.122 --> 51:51.758
and then they brought up my
history

51:51.790 --> 51:56.129
with Ed's dad on account
of we was old friends.

51:56.162 --> 52:01.167
Oh, and then they said that I
was an unreliable eye witness.

52:02.702 --> 52:04.870
Would you be willing
to go on record stating

52:04.903 --> 52:07.640
that it wasn't Ed that
you saw that morning?

52:07.673 --> 52:12.679
Well, I don't that that would
do much good now, but sure.

52:14.147 --> 52:15.816
I don't see why not.

52:20.620 --> 52:21.421
Yeah?

52:21.453 --> 52:22.522
It's me.

52:22.555 --> 52:23.390
Come in.

52:27.327 --> 52:28.662
What do you want, Lisa?

52:28.694 --> 52:30.229
She's helpin' me with the
story.

52:30.263 --> 52:32.265
That's what we wanna talk to you
about.

52:32.298 --> 52:34.033
David, I thought I made myself
clear.

52:34.066 --> 52:35.401
Look, I'm sorry, Sir,

52:35.435 --> 52:36.636
and you have every right to be
upset-

52:36.669 --> 52:38.338
- This is your assignment,

52:38.370 --> 52:40.439
and you, Lisa, you've got
at least three assignments

52:40.472 --> 52:41.306
that you haven't turned in yet.

52:41.341 --> 52:44.745
Look, I understand, but this
story

52:44.778 --> 52:46.780
is a bit more complicated than
we thought.

52:46.812 --> 52:47.680
How so?

52:47.714 --> 52:48.682
We believe there's a
connection

52:48.714 --> 52:50.783
between Susie and the
Jessica Mercer homicide.

52:50.816 --> 52:52.418
You believe?

52:52.452 --> 52:54.053
Anything concrete?

52:54.086 --> 52:56.255
That's what we're working on.

52:56.289 --> 52:57.857
So, what have you got?

52:57.890 --> 52:58.892
We have one source who says

52:58.925 --> 53:00.693
that Jessica's teacher molested
her

53:00.727 --> 53:02.896
and another source who
confirms that she was molested.

53:02.928 --> 53:04.430
By the teacher?

53:04.464 --> 53:05.565
Not conclusively.

53:05.597 --> 53:07.700
So what you've got is
a whole buncha hearsay.

53:07.734 --> 53:09.703
You guys are coming to me with
nothing.

53:10.537 --> 53:12.339
David, you're a better reporter
than this.

53:12.372 --> 53:14.875
We also talked to the
eye witness who testified

53:14.908 --> 53:17.511
that the person who dumped
Jessica's body was not Ed Henry.

53:17.544 --> 53:19.046
That testimony isn't new.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.482
You don't have enough, period.

53:22.515 --> 53:23.717
But what about our sources?

53:23.749 --> 53:25.549
They're real people with real-

53:24.584 --> 53:25.419
- Lisa.

53:26.952 --> 53:28.721
Whose side are you on?

53:28.754 --> 53:30.156
This isn't about sides, he's
right.

53:30.189 --> 53:31.590
We don't have enough and we
can't run it.

53:31.624 --> 53:32.425
Are you kidding me?

53:32.457 --> 53:34.227
You lookin' to lose your job?

53:39.966 --> 53:40.767
Thanks a lot.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.468
Hey, Lisa, I...

53:43.903 --> 53:45.705
David, I don't have time for
this.

53:46.638 --> 53:47.607
You know, better.

53:48.740 --> 53:49.742
You better get your shit
together

53:49.776 --> 53:51.845
or I'm gonna have to find
somebody else.

54:39.559 --> 54:41.361
Well, how come the
prices went up?

54:41.394 --> 54:43.696
And you know what she
said when I asked her?

54:43.729 --> 54:44.497
What's that?

54:44.531 --> 54:45.999
She said the prices went
up

54:46.031 --> 54:47.600
because they end up
paying for the new menu.

55:49.361 --> 55:50.430
Havin' fun?

55:52.899 --> 55:53.734
I was.

55:55.100 --> 55:57.169
Did you come here to apologize?

55:57.202 --> 55:58.537
Look, I...

56:00.238 --> 56:01.774
You're unbelievable.

56:01.807 --> 56:02.642
What?

56:04.243 --> 56:05.612
You threw me under the bus.

56:05.644 --> 56:06.746
Are you kidding?

56:08.013 --> 56:09.249
Look, Jason's right.

56:09.281 --> 56:10.283
We don't have enough.

56:10.316 --> 56:11.618
So what, you're just gonna
give up?

56:11.651 --> 56:14.988
No, I'm not giving up, all
right?

56:15.021 --> 56:17.189
I know Jason and then
you can't make this story

56:17.222 --> 56:18.824
some personal retribution for-

56:18.857 --> 56:19.693
- For what?

56:20.827 --> 56:21.627
What?

56:21.660 --> 56:22.761
Go ahead and say it.

56:22.794 --> 56:23.963
Listen.

56:23.997 --> 56:25.299
No, you listen.

56:26.332 --> 56:30.337
You have no right to
tell me how to do my job,

56:30.370 --> 56:33.640
to imply that I have some
sort of score to settle

56:33.673 --> 56:35.207
like I'm incapable of being
impartial

56:35.240 --> 56:36.508
like some sort of emotional
child.

56:36.542 --> 56:37.344
- Okay?
- Lisa-

56:37.377 --> 56:38.645
- Would you let me finish?

56:39.979 --> 56:43.450
I'm good at this, okay?

56:43.482 --> 56:46.852
And I know if nothing else
I can write a good story.

56:46.885 --> 56:49.889
Yeah, well, we both know that
this isn't just about work.

56:50.890 --> 56:52.459
I don't give shit about the
past.

56:52.492 --> 56:53.292
Yeah?

56:53.325 --> 56:54.160
Well, I fucking do.

56:55.327 --> 56:56.128
Okay?

56:56.162 --> 56:57.364
Look, you left.

56:57.397 --> 56:59.899
No word, no warning, nothing.

56:59.932 --> 57:01.568
I wake up and you're gone.

57:03.269 --> 57:05.004
How do you think that made me
feel?

57:05.905 --> 57:07.573
Look, I'm sorry for ghosting
you.

57:09.175 --> 57:10.243
Really, I am.

57:11.443 --> 57:12.778
But I have a little more
important things

57:12.812 --> 57:13.747
on my mind right now.

57:13.780 --> 57:14.647
Too bad, we're gonna talk
about this.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.148
All right, you wanna talk
about it?

57:16.182 --> 57:17.017
Fine.

57:18.484 --> 57:21.254
You wanted our friendship
to be more, I wasn't ready.

57:22.488 --> 57:24.790
I thought I was, but I wasn't.

57:24.823 --> 57:26.059
Then you tell me.

57:27.693 --> 57:28.727
You don't just disappear.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.162
That's not what people do.

57:31.330 --> 57:32.432
Why are you back here?

57:33.365 --> 57:34.800
Because I have a job to do.

57:34.834 --> 57:35.868
You know What I mean.

57:35.901 --> 57:37.336
Why are you back here?

57:38.604 --> 57:39.539
You could go anywhere else.

57:39.571 --> 57:41.073
Because I was fired.

57:51.184 --> 57:54.521
I had a good lead on a story.

57:58.156 --> 58:03.162
My boss thought that I was
too emotionally involved,

58:07.066 --> 58:08.167
but I kept pushing.

58:12.205 --> 58:13.407
They fired me.

58:15.774 --> 58:16.910
Typical Lisa, right?

58:24.649 --> 58:26.952
David, I'm so sorry for what I
did to you.

58:30.356 --> 58:31.725
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

58:40.566 --> 58:41.468
To apologies.

58:48.540 --> 58:49.908
Jesus, that's fuckin' awful.

58:49.941 --> 58:52.111
What do you expect from a $3
margarita?

58:55.414 --> 58:57.050
I gotta go.

58:57.082 --> 59:00.052
Gotta get to the library before
it closes.

59:00.086 --> 59:01.053
Any new leads?

59:02.321 --> 59:03.156
No.

59:07.627 --> 59:08.428
I'll drive.

59:22.874 --> 59:24.077
What are you lookin' at?

59:24.109 --> 59:27.347
Some old Skidmore yearbooks.

59:27.379 --> 59:28.180
Did you find anything?

59:28.214 --> 59:30.016
Just pictures of Susie.

59:32.185 --> 59:33.553
Here, can I see this?

59:33.586 --> 59:34.421
Sure.

59:39.024 --> 59:39.892
That's her.

59:40.859 --> 59:41.760
Yeah, that's Susie.

59:41.794 --> 59:44.431
No, that's my source.

59:45.330 --> 59:46.165
Are you sure?

59:47.999 --> 59:50.802
Yeah, I've just never
seen her picture before.

59:50.836 --> 59:51.872
Where are you goin'?

59:53.205 --> 59:54.339
Hey!

59:54.372 --> 59:55.240
You're my ride.

1:00:04.617 --> 1:00:07.187
Hi, Diane, this is Lisa
Johnson.

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:08.922
I'm so sorry to be calling you
so late

1:00:08.955 --> 1:00:09.789
but I was wondering if you

1:00:09.823 --> 1:00:12.425
had a phone number for Cassie
Gilland?

1:00:12.457 --> 1:00:13.258
Yeah, I think so.

1:00:13.292 --> 1:00:14.127
Let me check.

1:00:16.194 --> 1:00:16.995
Lisa?

1:00:17.028 --> 1:00:18.197
Yeah?

1:00:18.231 --> 1:00:19.031
Hey, I got one.

1:00:19.064 --> 1:00:20.566
Are you ready?

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:22.468
Yeah, I'm ready.

1:00:22.501 --> 1:00:24.336
587-8000.

1:00:27.807 --> 1:00:29.376
All right, thank you so much.

1:00:35.847 --> 1:00:36.648
Hello?

1:00:36.682 --> 1:00:38.117
Cassie?

1:00:38.149 --> 1:00:39.051
Yes?

1:00:39.084 --> 1:00:41.620
This is Lisa Johnson.

1:00:41.653 --> 1:00:42.521
I believe we've met.

1:00:48.394 --> 1:00:51.464
Well, we went to the
same school together.

1:00:53.064 --> 1:00:54.967
I think we were pretty
close.

1:00:56.269 --> 1:00:59.872
We had all the same classes,
went to the same church,

1:00:59.905 --> 1:01:02.042
hung out after school, talked
about boys.

1:01:03.109 --> 1:01:04.511
Just normal stuff, you know?

1:01:05.977 --> 1:01:08.180
Was there anything different
about her?

1:01:08.214 --> 1:01:12.285
I never used to think so,
but now I'm not so sure.

1:01:12.318 --> 1:01:13.252
What do you mean?

1:01:14.819 --> 1:01:16.388
I never thought about it much,

1:01:16.421 --> 1:01:19.225
but sometimes the Susie would
act strange.

1:01:21.426 --> 1:01:22.828
Strange?

1:01:22.861 --> 1:01:23.963
Just distant.

1:01:25.698 --> 1:01:28.201
Sometimes we'd undress for gym
class

1:01:28.234 --> 1:01:31.471
and she'd have these bruises
on her knees and her chest.

1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:37.577
I asked where she, if she was
okay,

1:01:37.609 --> 1:01:39.511
but I mean, she'd just laugh.

1:01:41.180 --> 1:01:43.716
And why didn't
you tell anyone about this?

1:01:44.749 --> 1:01:46.218
I was just a kid.

1:01:46.252 --> 1:01:48.455
I didn't really think anything
was wrong,

1:01:49.388 --> 1:01:53.560
and it wasn't until I got
older that I realized ,

1:01:56.294 --> 1:01:57.731
that there was this monster

1:01:59.698 --> 1:02:01.501
and I couldn't do anything about
it.

1:02:02.901 --> 1:02:05.437
You're talking about
your teacher, right?

1:02:06.405 --> 1:02:07.240
Teacher?

1:02:08.173 --> 1:02:09.775
Jeff Darrach?

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:13.245
No, he may be a little
weird, but he's harmless.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:15.749
Then who?

1:02:20.885 --> 1:02:22.021
Our youth minister.

1:02:22.988 --> 1:02:24.323
Donovan?

1:02:24.356 --> 1:02:25.957
Yeah.

1:02:25.990 --> 1:02:27.526
Look, Susie's dad was dead.

1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:30.163
Matt was like a father to her.

1:02:30.196 --> 1:02:32.565
Did Susie ever say anything to
you?

1:02:32.597 --> 1:02:33.465
Just that she would help out

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:36.136
and then they'd play these
games,

1:02:37.068 --> 1:02:39.305
but I realized she wasn't
herself.

1:02:40.705 --> 1:02:43.542
Were you ever alone with
Donovan?

1:02:43.575 --> 1:02:44.376
No.

1:02:46.845 --> 1:02:49.982
But I did go to their
house once with Susie.

1:02:54.153 --> 1:02:56.589
I remember Grace made us snacks,

1:02:56.622 --> 1:03:00.260
but she left to go get some
groceries

1:03:01.993 --> 1:03:04.698
and Donovan said that
we should play a game.

1:03:06.198 --> 1:03:07.734
He wanted to see who could get
tickled

1:03:07.767 --> 1:03:09.736
the longest without laughing.

1:03:11.970 --> 1:03:13.806
He tickled Susie first.

1:03:16.841 --> 1:03:21.747
And then he went over to me
and started to tickle me.

1:03:21.781 --> 1:03:22.615
But...

1:03:24.582 --> 1:03:26.251
But he, he moved his hands up

1:03:26.285 --> 1:03:29.556
and started touching my chest,

1:03:31.156 --> 1:03:34.459
and I told him to stop and he
wouldn't

1:03:34.493 --> 1:03:36.730
and so I yelled, "Stop!"

1:03:40.198 --> 1:03:42.200
I was so upset.

1:03:42.234 --> 1:03:45.505
I left the room and I wandered
upstairs into their bedroom.

1:03:47.872 --> 1:03:50.743
I could hear him tickling
Susie in the background.

1:03:57.015 --> 1:04:01.988
I was looking around and
I saw this little box.

1:04:03.789 --> 1:04:08.727
So, I opened it and it
started to play music,

1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:13.766
and the bottom layer was
loose so I lifted it up.

1:04:17.669 --> 1:04:20.472
I saw Polaroid of a young
girl without her shirt.

1:04:22.841 --> 1:04:26.178
And then I heard footsteps
and so I put the box down,

1:04:27.046 --> 1:04:29.881
and Donovan came in and smiled
and said,

1:04:29.914 --> 1:04:31.316
"Don't be snooping."

1:04:32.618 --> 1:04:34.620
Who do you think it was?

1:04:34.653 --> 1:04:37.589
Look, it wasn't until I
saw a story on the local news

1:04:37.622 --> 1:04:40.325
about the 10 year anniversary
of Jessica Mercer's murder

1:04:40.359 --> 1:04:42.462
that I knew that that was the
girl.

1:04:43.662 --> 1:04:44.964
And what about his wife?

1:04:48.667 --> 1:04:50.002
I've wondered about her.

1:04:52.004 --> 1:04:53.372
She seemed so nice.

1:04:53.405 --> 1:04:55.140
But then again, so did he.

1:04:58.676 --> 1:05:00.812
I have a feeling she knows
something.

1:05:07.385 --> 1:05:09.855
Miss, we just need an address
for Grace.

1:05:10.890 --> 1:05:11.790
I know, I'm sorry.

1:05:11.823 --> 1:05:13.992
I just can't give out that
information.

1:05:14.026 --> 1:05:15.560
I understand that but
we haven't been able

1:05:15.593 --> 1:05:17.463
to reach her for weeks.

1:05:17.495 --> 1:05:18.597
Well, I suggest that
you try

1:05:18.631 --> 1:05:20.031
the number that you have again.

1:05:20.064 --> 1:05:22.534
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can
do.

1:05:22.568 --> 1:05:23.435
Yeah, sure.

1:05:26.205 --> 1:05:27.040
Any luck?

1:05:29.975 --> 1:05:31.844
Did you try Diane Potter?

1:05:31.877 --> 1:05:33.412
She hasn't seen her.

1:05:33.444 --> 1:05:34.446
Even tried the county clerk

1:05:34.479 --> 1:05:37.115
but of course they
wouldn't tell me anything.

1:05:37.149 --> 1:05:38.718
Shit, that might be it then.

1:05:40.986 --> 1:05:41.888
And maybe not.

1:05:43.421 --> 1:05:44.923
Yeah, thanks
for getting back to me.

1:05:44.957 --> 1:05:48.227
I have a couple of questions for
you.

1:05:50.796 --> 1:05:51.597
Hello?

1:05:51.629 --> 1:05:52.430
Hi, Alyssa?

1:05:52.464 --> 1:05:53.833
This is David Fremont again

1:05:53.865 --> 1:05:55.100
from "The Maryville Daily
Forum."

1:05:55.133 --> 1:05:56.801
I already told
you, I don't know anything.

1:05:56.834 --> 1:05:58.236
No, that's fine.

1:05:58.269 --> 1:05:59.738
Look, we've been trying to reach
Grace.

1:05:59.772 --> 1:06:02.308
You don't happen to have
an address for her do you?

1:06:02.341 --> 1:06:03.342
What for?

1:06:03.374 --> 1:06:05.744
Well, it's for Susie's story.

1:06:05.778 --> 1:06:07.747
She'd be incredibly helpful to
talk to.

1:06:08.847 --> 1:06:11.716
I got it, but
you didn't get it from me.

1:06:11.749 --> 1:06:14.719
She lives on Cherry Street in
Isadore.

1:06:14.752 --> 1:06:15.955
Thank you so much.

1:06:15.988 --> 1:06:18.691
All right, got an address.

1:06:18.723 --> 1:06:19.559
Let's roll.

1:06:44.883 --> 1:06:45.718
Grace?

1:06:47.919 --> 1:06:48.753
Anyone home?

1:06:59.064 --> 1:06:59.899
Grace?

1:07:01.834 --> 1:07:02.669
Can I help you?

1:07:04.435 --> 1:07:06.771
We're reporters from "The
Maryville Daily Forum."

1:07:06.805 --> 1:07:08.774
I don't have anything to say
to you.

1:07:08.807 --> 1:07:11.176
Please, it'll
only take a few minutes.

1:07:11.209 --> 1:07:13.545
If y'all won't
leave I'm gonna call the cops.

1:07:14.946 --> 1:07:18.783
Grace, we're just here
to ask you a few questions.

1:07:18.816 --> 1:07:21.186
You knew those girls better than
anyone.

1:07:21.220 --> 1:07:22.053
Look, I've already
told

1:07:22.086 --> 1:07:23.555
the cops everything I know.

1:07:23.589 --> 1:07:25.424
My story hasn't changed.

1:07:25.457 --> 1:07:26.290
And we believe you.

1:07:26.325 --> 1:07:27.961
We're not accusing you of
anything.

1:07:32.263 --> 1:07:33.698
We found some recent evidence

1:07:33.731 --> 1:07:36.068
that should have been
followed up on years ago.

1:07:37.736 --> 1:07:40.973
Evidence that involves your
ex-husband.

1:07:49.515 --> 1:07:50.950
What about Matt?

1:07:50.982 --> 1:07:52.084
A source tells us he may

1:07:52.117 --> 1:07:54.720
have inappropriately
touched a few of the girls.

1:07:56.187 --> 1:07:58.057
Never around me.

1:07:58.089 --> 1:08:00.225
Were you always around?

1:08:00.258 --> 1:08:01.093
No.

1:08:02.227 --> 1:08:04.664
Sometimes he would hold
private counsel with the kids.

1:08:05.698 --> 1:08:06.531
One-on-one?

1:08:08.133 --> 1:08:11.771
I saw our youth ministry as a
team,

1:08:13.171 --> 1:08:16.042
but he said as the pastor that
there

1:08:16.074 --> 1:08:18.476
are some things that only he
could do.

1:08:18.510 --> 1:08:20.512
Did anyone ever question his
behavior?

1:08:21.946 --> 1:08:23.248
Everyone trusted Matt.

1:08:24.216 --> 1:08:25.818
Were there ever any incidents?

1:08:27.252 --> 1:08:29.722
Susie came out of
his office once crying.

1:08:31.155 --> 1:08:32.957
I asked him what had happened

1:08:32.990 --> 1:08:36.461
and he said that it had
something to do with her father.

1:08:36.494 --> 1:08:38.897
Did you tell anyone about
this?

1:08:38.931 --> 1:08:41.034
I just assumed he was telling
the truth.

1:08:41.999 --> 1:08:44.369
Well, this situation clearly
stood out

1:08:44.403 --> 1:08:46.439
in your mind for you to remember
it after all these years.

1:08:46.471 --> 1:08:51.043
Listen, as a minister, Matt
counseled people all the time.

1:08:53.244 --> 1:08:54.846
Was he ever physical with you?

1:08:57.449 --> 1:08:58.951
Wait, please.

1:08:58.984 --> 1:08:59.985
I'm sorry, Grace.

1:09:00.017 --> 1:09:00.852
Just...

1:09:04.189 --> 1:09:05.290
This is important.

1:09:16.034 --> 1:09:16.869
Once.

1:09:20.172 --> 1:09:21.808
When I was cleaning the bedroom,

1:09:24.642 --> 1:09:26.745
I knocked over his mother's
keepsake.

1:09:28.913 --> 1:09:29.748
He heard it.

1:09:31.784 --> 1:09:33.920
When I went to pick it up, he
grabbed me.

1:09:37.823 --> 1:09:39.825
I thought he was gonna break my
arm.

1:09:42.293 --> 1:09:44.497
Do you think Matthew
was hiding something?

1:09:51.736 --> 1:09:54.806
By the time I decided
to leave, it was easy.

1:09:56.175 --> 1:09:57.577
He was so distant.

1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:06.284
It was like saying goodbye
to an acquaintance,

1:10:06.318 --> 1:10:07.218
rather than somebody

1:10:07.253 --> 1:10:09.055
who I'd been married to for
eight years.

1:10:16.461 --> 1:10:17.296
Donovan's lying.

1:10:19.364 --> 1:10:21.033
About which part?

1:10:21.065 --> 1:10:23.702
Grace clearly doesn't have
a problem getting pregnant.

1:10:24.703 --> 1:10:26.372
Why would he lie about that?

1:10:26.404 --> 1:10:28.840
Maybe he's got some
intimacy issues of his own.

1:10:30.074 --> 1:10:31.309
How much you wanna bet that
keepsake

1:10:31.342 --> 1:10:34.180
she almost got her arm
broken for was a music box?

1:10:50.262 --> 1:10:51.797
Look, he might be good for this,

1:10:51.829 --> 1:10:54.533
but you're not pinning it on
Donovan and making it stick,

1:10:54.565 --> 1:10:55.568
not without a story.

1:10:55.601 --> 1:10:57.537
We're not pinning anything on
him.

1:10:59.337 --> 1:11:00.905
He killed those girls.

1:11:00.939 --> 1:11:02.441
Yeah, and last week you
wanted to hang Darrach

1:11:02.473 --> 1:11:03.943
for the same murders, right?

1:11:03.976 --> 1:11:04.810
That's not journalism.

1:11:04.842 --> 1:11:05.944
That's a witch hunt.

1:11:05.977 --> 1:11:08.413
This is about more
than the story, David.

1:11:08.446 --> 1:11:10.114
Oh yeah, since when?

1:11:10.147 --> 1:11:10.949
You know what?

1:11:10.982 --> 1:11:11.816
We're not cops, Lisa,

1:11:11.851 --> 1:11:12.751
and I think you forget that, all
right?

1:11:12.784 --> 1:11:13.819
We don't serve justice.

1:11:13.851 --> 1:11:14.653
We write facts.

1:11:14.686 --> 1:11:16.155
Fucking spare me the lecture!

1:11:16.187 --> 1:11:16.989
All right, Jesus.

1:11:17.021 --> 1:11:18.490
What do you want me to do here?

1:11:19.391 --> 1:11:20.626
Do you think he did it?

1:11:22.093 --> 1:11:23.662
We don't have enough evidence.

1:11:23.695 --> 1:11:25.764
I don't give a shit if
we have conclusive evidence

1:11:25.797 --> 1:11:26.631
to go to print.

1:11:26.664 --> 1:11:28.167
I'm asking you if you think he
did it?

1:11:28.199 --> 1:11:29.034
Yes.

1:11:30.735 --> 1:11:31.570
I do.

1:11:32.571 --> 1:11:34.405
Then we have a
responsibility to do something

1:11:34.439 --> 1:11:36.309
about it before this happens
again.

1:11:40.212 --> 1:11:42.214
What do you wanna do?

1:11:42.247 --> 1:11:44.717
Cassie and Grace both
mentioned that music box.

1:11:46.885 --> 1:11:48.887
What if Susie's picture's in
there, too?

1:11:50.855 --> 1:11:51.756
It's true, but it's not like

1:11:51.789 --> 1:11:53.325
we can go in there and take it.

1:11:57.329 --> 1:11:58.164
No.

1:11:59.131 --> 1:12:00.531
What?

1:12:00.565 --> 1:12:02.268
You're not goin' in there.

1:12:02.301 --> 1:12:04.336
What other options do we have?

1:12:04.369 --> 1:12:06.105
Not only would you
be risking your career,

1:12:06.137 --> 1:12:07.640
you'd be risking your life.

1:12:07.672 --> 1:12:10.175
You're willing to do that for
this?

1:12:10.208 --> 1:12:11.110
Absolutely.

1:12:12.644 --> 1:12:17.650
Look, I will go in, take the
pictures and whatever I find,

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.421
we'll send to the police
anonymously.

1:12:22.454 --> 1:12:24.690
You can stay in the car.

1:12:24.722 --> 1:12:26.057
You don't even have to come
inside.

1:12:26.091 --> 1:12:27.627
Oh, I'm gonna be the lookout?

1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:31.797
One of us getting caught
is bad enough, but two of us?

1:12:33.798 --> 1:12:35.600
Besides, do you know how to pick
locks?

1:12:35.633 --> 1:12:37.101
No. Do you?

1:12:37.135 --> 1:12:42.141
Maybe, and I'll also have
this.

1:12:42.173 --> 1:12:43.141
Lisa!

1:12:43.175 --> 1:12:43.976
What?

1:12:44.008 --> 1:12:45.043
You're gonna take a gun in
there?

1:12:45.077 --> 1:12:46.712
I'll only use it if I have to.

1:12:47.846 --> 1:12:51.284
Look, I'm doing this or without
you.

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:04.256
What time is it?

1:14:04.288 --> 1:14:05.857
About a quarter 'til eight.

1:14:07.659 --> 1:14:09.862
He'll be leaving for
Bible study any minute.

1:14:16.635 --> 1:14:17.703
Hey, Lisa?

1:14:17.735 --> 1:14:18.570
Yeah?

1:14:28.579 --> 1:14:30.582
Here he comes.

1:15:16.328 --> 1:15:17.329
All right.

1:15:18.395 --> 1:15:19.230
Goin' in.

1:18:09.066 --> 1:18:09.901
Damn it!

1:18:20.811 --> 1:18:21.613
Hey, he's at the door.

1:18:21.645 --> 1:18:22.980
You need to get out, right now.

1:18:46.604 --> 1:18:47.439
Hey, what's up?

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:49.475
You've got it?

1:18:52.711 --> 1:18:54.378
Great. Okay.

1:18:54.412 --> 1:18:55.747
I'll be right there.

1:21:00.738 --> 1:21:02.473
Find what you're looking for?

1:21:04.074 --> 1:21:06.177
Lisa, what are you doing?

1:21:12.851 --> 1:21:14.453
I see you're admiring my photos.

1:21:15.686 --> 1:21:18.055
You know, I've always loved
Polaroids.

1:21:18.088 --> 1:21:20.191
There's just something special
about them.

1:21:21.258 --> 1:21:24.061
You didn't have to share them
with anyone.

1:21:24.095 --> 1:21:24.896
You don't have to take 'em

1:21:24.928 --> 1:21:27.431
to a developer and taint the
memory.

1:21:27.464 --> 1:21:30.935
These photos were my intimate
moments,

1:21:30.968 --> 1:21:32.471
and you've ruined that for me.

1:21:33.872 --> 1:21:36.408
Sorry for ruining your
perverted fantasies.

1:21:38.075 --> 1:21:39.544
Who have you been talking to?

1:21:43.047 --> 1:21:44.383
You know something?

1:21:46.150 --> 1:21:47.453
You're very pretty.

1:21:49.186 --> 1:21:51.021
I'm a little old for you.

1:21:51.055 --> 1:21:52.891
No need to get nasty.

1:21:54.092 --> 1:21:54.927
Let her go.

1:21:58.896 --> 1:21:59.730
David.

1:22:01.164 --> 1:22:02.266
How nice to see you.

1:22:03.133 --> 1:22:04.401
Get away from her.

1:22:13.477 --> 1:22:15.312
Lisa, what are you doin'?

1:22:15.346 --> 1:22:16.815
What the fuck are these?

1:22:16.847 --> 1:22:19.083
I told you, memories.

1:22:20.184 --> 1:22:21.151
And there's more.

1:22:21.185 --> 1:22:22.020
Where are they?

1:22:24.187 --> 1:22:25.524
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.

1:22:25.556 --> 1:22:26.724
The pictures of the other
girls.

1:22:26.757 --> 1:22:27.958
- Lisa.
- They have to be

1:22:27.992 --> 1:22:28.894
here somewhere.

1:22:28.927 --> 1:22:29.728
Lisa?

1:22:29.761 --> 1:22:31.029
Help me, David.

1:22:34.699 --> 1:22:35.801
We have to go, now.

1:23:12.302 --> 1:23:13.137
Say somethin'.

1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:16.475
Lisa?

1:23:20.311 --> 1:23:22.714
What do you want me to say?

1:23:25.382 --> 1:23:26.584
What about the photos?

1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:30.355
Nothing.

1:23:34.225 --> 1:23:35.260
There was nothing.

1:23:35.293 --> 1:23:36.495
What do you mean?

1:23:38.363 --> 1:23:39.565
They were just photos.

1:23:40.832 --> 1:23:42.300
It was nothing incriminating.

1:23:42.333 --> 1:23:43.902
There wasn't a fucking thing.

1:23:47.504 --> 1:23:51.042
Do you think he's
gonna go to the police?

1:23:51.074 --> 1:23:51.909
No.

1:23:55.579 --> 1:23:57.015
It's exactly what he wants.

1:24:00.284 --> 1:24:01.954
It's a fucking game to him.

1:24:05.056 --> 1:24:08.060
He gets off knowing we have
absolutely nothing on him.

1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:03.647
Oh, sit down.

1:25:03.681 --> 1:25:06.351
Jesus, that's so unnecessary.

1:25:08.653 --> 1:25:09.687
I got you a coffee.

1:25:14.092 --> 1:25:14.926
You look good.

1:25:17.128 --> 1:25:17.963
You too.

1:25:21.399 --> 1:25:24.436
So, how's the paper?

1:25:24.468 --> 1:25:25.302
It's good.

1:25:26.337 --> 1:25:27.739
Another day, another tractor
pull.

1:25:28.972 --> 1:25:31.575
But um, not as exciting without
you.

1:25:31.609 --> 1:25:34.512
Oh yeah, I'm sure
Jason really misses me.

1:25:34.544 --> 1:25:37.214
Well, it's hard to find good
reporters.

1:25:41.918 --> 1:25:42.753
You doin' okay?

1:25:47.057 --> 1:25:47.892
I'm fine.

1:25:52.829 --> 1:25:57.836
Actually I um, I wanted to tell you

1:25:59.102 --> 1:26:00.271
that I was leaving.

1:26:02.006 --> 1:26:03.107
Did you get another job?

1:26:03.141 --> 1:26:08.146
No, just uh, I'm just
gonna get away for awhile.

1:26:10.547 --> 1:26:11.816
Where you goin'?

1:26:13.784 --> 1:26:16.720
Thailand.

1:26:16.753 --> 1:26:18.155
That's certainly different.

1:26:18.189 --> 1:26:19.356
Yeah.

1:26:24.294 --> 1:26:26.297
Where are you really goin'?

1:26:27.597 --> 1:26:28.766
I don't know yet.

1:26:32.970 --> 1:26:35.339
Uh, I should actually be going.

1:26:35.373 --> 1:26:40.111
I just wanted to tell you this
time instead of just leaving.

1:26:40.144 --> 1:26:41.212
So.

1:26:41.244 --> 1:26:42.213
Lisa I um,

1:26:47.517 --> 1:26:49.486
I hope you find what you're
lookin' for.

1:27:01.798 --> 1:27:03.868
I'll let you know when
I do.

1:27:03.900 --> 1:27:05.302
You know where to find me.

1:27:18.748 --> 1:27:19.583
Hello?

1:27:20.685 --> 1:27:23.355
Got that information
you were lookin' into.

1:27:24.555 --> 1:27:25.824
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1:27:48.412 --> 1:27:49.681
Now, I know
you're all at a points

1:27:49.713 --> 1:27:51.915
where you're learning about
a lotta different religions,

1:27:51.949 --> 1:27:54.619
different schools of
thoughts and belief systems.

1:27:54.651 --> 1:27:56.520
And some of them might sound
enticing.

1:27:56.553 --> 1:27:58.422
I'm not gonna tell you it's
wrong.

1:27:58.455 --> 1:28:01.458
There's always things we
can learn from other people,

1:28:01.492 --> 1:28:04.628
but I must warn you there will
be some

1:28:04.662 --> 1:28:06.364
who are not as they appear.

1:28:07.297 --> 1:28:08.198
I'd like to go ahead and read

1:28:08.231 --> 1:28:10.968
you a passage from 2 Corinthians
11.

1:28:12.069 --> 1:28:17.075
"For such men are false
apostles, deceitful workers,

1:28:17.374 --> 1:28:20.712
disguising themselves
as apostles of Christ.

1:28:22.113 --> 1:28:26.217
No wonder, for even
Satan disguises himself

1:28:26.249 --> 1:28:27.819
as an angel of light."
