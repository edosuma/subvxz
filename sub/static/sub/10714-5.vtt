WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:06.322
Shea, what does this say?
Alice sent me a text.

00:06.324 --> 00:07.924
It's just tiny cartoons.

00:07.926 --> 00:09.158
Those are emojis.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.493
Emojis?

00:10.495 --> 00:13.129
God, I hate new things.

00:13.131 --> 00:14.798
Heart, bed, female cop.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.502
Oh, that must mean Alice
is coming home in uniform.

00:19.504 --> 00:21.170
When grandma is in her
prison guard outfit

00:21.172 --> 00:23.940
I find her particularly enticing.

00:25.676 --> 00:29.345
You know, Dad, I was going
to try to eat this, so...

00:29.347 --> 00:32.749
if you would just please
never, never say that again.

00:33.851 --> 00:36.619
- Hello.
- Hello, officer.

00:36.621 --> 00:39.956
I'm a bad boy, bad boy.
Whatcha gonna do?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.828
So I'll just go on a diet.

00:45.763 --> 00:47.030
Oh, Mike, I wanted to tell you

00:47.032 --> 00:48.865
we got an inmate request today.

00:48.867 --> 00:50.934
A prisoner wants to meet with you.

00:50.936 --> 00:52.235
Kyle Sullivan.

00:52.237 --> 00:54.437
Kyle Sullivan? Kyle
Sullivan's in prison?

00:54.439 --> 00:56.940
That is fantastic. I hope he fries.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.442
Who is Kyle Sullivan?

00:59.444 --> 01:01.578
He was your dad's fifth grade bully.

01:01.580 --> 01:02.912
You had a bully, Dad?

01:02.914 --> 01:05.281
You're like a giant.

01:05.283 --> 01:06.783
I was small back then,

01:06.785 --> 01:08.818
and Kyle was responsible
for the most humiliating

01:08.820 --> 01:10.954
moment of my life.

01:10.956 --> 01:12.689
He super glued me to my chair,

01:12.691 --> 01:13.923
and I had to climb out of my pants

01:13.925 --> 01:16.059
in front of the whole class.

01:17.695 --> 01:18.895
He was standing there crying

01:18.897 --> 01:21.898
in his little Superman underpants.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.135
I skipped over certain
details for a reason.

01:26.137 --> 01:27.837
You should have seen Mike back then.

01:27.839 --> 01:30.106
Short, scrawny, glasses,

01:30.108 --> 01:32.408
an all-you-can-eat buffet for bullies.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.144
Well, it didn't help that you
cut my hair with a bowl.

01:35.146 --> 01:37.146
Well, I wasn't gonna pay
five bucks for a haircut.

01:37.148 --> 01:39.482
I'd already paid five
bucks for the bowl.

01:41.285 --> 01:43.419
I want to see pictures.

01:43.421 --> 01:45.388
Well, they don't exist.
I got rid of them all.

01:45.390 --> 01:47.123
Oh, so we can get rid of
all the pictures of me

01:47.125 --> 01:49.158
with glasses, braces, and zits.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.094
No. Those are adorable.

01:51.096 --> 01:54.831
You were such a sweet little mess.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.099
we're sisters,

01:56.101 --> 01:59.769
but I never needed glasses,
braces, or had zits.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.471
What a fun point.

02:03.507 --> 02:05.074
Weren't you a huge bully, Stella?

02:05.076 --> 02:06.542
I wasn't a bully.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.345
I just mocked people for their
appearance or being different.

02:09.347 --> 02:10.613
And you know, some of those kids

02:10.615 --> 02:12.849
lost the weight, so...

02:14.351 --> 02:16.085
But if dad's still
upset about his bully,

02:16.087 --> 02:18.488
then maybe some of the kids
from my class are too.

02:18.490 --> 02:20.223
You could track them
down and make amends.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.091
Yeah, I suppose I could.

02:22.093 --> 02:24.727
There was this one kid I
should really say sorry to.

02:24.729 --> 02:29.232
His name was Elliot, but
I called him "Smelliot."

02:29.234 --> 02:32.135
And they say hot girls aren't funny.

02:32.137 --> 02:34.604
You know, Mike, maybe that's
why Kyle contacted you.

02:34.606 --> 02:36.005
To apologize.

02:36.007 --> 02:37.841
It could be good to finally
bring some closure

02:37.843 --> 02:41.010
to a time in your life that
obviously still haunts you.

02:41.012 --> 02:43.913
Bad idea, Mike. Let the
past stay in the past.

02:43.915 --> 02:46.816
Don't go to see Kyle.
Trust me on this one.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.151
Well, I'm gonna go see him.

02:48.153 --> 02:51.054
I've been dreaming about this
moment for over 30 years.

02:51.056 --> 02:53.556
Being big and successful and married,

02:53.558 --> 02:56.159
and looking him in the eye and saying,

02:56.161 --> 02:57.927
"Ha ha, I won!"

02:59.330 --> 03:00.597
Martina, I want you to come with me.

03:00.599 --> 03:02.165
Oh, that's a great idea,

03:02.167 --> 03:03.867
'cause you know, as a therapist,

03:03.869 --> 03:05.134
I've helped lots of my patients

03:05.136 --> 03:06.469
confront the people who hurt them.

03:06.471 --> 03:09.138
Yeah, sounds good. Just
wear something super hot.

03:13.111 --> 03:15.745
I'm still not sure about
this outfit, Mike.

03:15.747 --> 03:17.680
I mean, I know you want to show me off,

03:17.682 --> 03:20.283
and how taut my body is
even after two kids,

03:20.285 --> 03:21.985
and how Pilates has kept me...

03:21.987 --> 03:25.388
Let's bring him back in here, Martina.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.656
You look beautiful.

03:26.658 --> 03:27.824
Thank you.

03:27.826 --> 03:29.259
Oh, I'm so nervous all of a sudden.

03:29.261 --> 03:30.693
I'm a grown man.

03:30.695 --> 03:31.928
It's perfectly normal.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.664
When you confront someone
who hurt you as a child,

03:34.666 --> 03:36.866
it's not unusual to feel
like that child again.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.601
Oh, my God. There he is.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.972
That mountain with a beard?

03:42.974 --> 03:44.541
No, the guy behind him.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.494
Oh, my God. That's Kyle?

04:04.496 --> 04:05.862
Well...

04:05.864 --> 04:08.231
Kyle was that size in fifth grade

04:08.233 --> 04:11.768
plus anybody's gonna look small
next to Amish Hulk Hogan.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.336
Thanks for the escort, Marcus.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.305
Later I want to do some
lifting in the yard,

04:15.307 --> 04:17.839
nothing too heavy; I'm
going for tone, not bulk.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.007
You think I'm too bulky?

04:19.010 --> 04:21.945
No, no, no. On you it works.

04:21.947 --> 04:22.946
Here you go.

04:22.948 --> 04:23.980
No, I don't smoke.

04:23.982 --> 04:26.249
You should. It makes you look cool.

04:28.118 --> 04:30.353
Hey, Mikey. You got rid of the bowl cut.

04:30.355 --> 04:31.554
Good move.

04:34.091 --> 04:35.725
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your daughter here?

04:35.727 --> 04:37.527
Oh. I'm not his...

04:37.529 --> 04:39.095
Just calm down, Martina.

04:41.565 --> 04:43.867
This is my wife.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.368
EnchantÃ©, Martina.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.669
Call me Neil Young,

04:46.671 --> 04:48.404
'cause I wanna live
with a cinnamon girl.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.208
I also have a big house, a great job;

04:52.210 --> 04:53.843
I got two beautiful daughters.

04:53.845 --> 04:58.114
So, in conclusion, ha ha, I win.

05:00.851 --> 05:03.119
Kiss me, Martina.

05:03.121 --> 05:04.487
Kiss me in front of him.

05:11.962 --> 05:14.564
And I assume that you asked me
here so you could apologize.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.366
Before you do, I would
also like to mention

05:16.368 --> 05:18.368
that I fly a helicopter.

05:19.837 --> 05:22.639
I defy gravity like a god.

05:23.541 --> 05:25.141
That's incredible.

05:25.143 --> 05:27.443
And... apologize for what, buddy?

05:27.445 --> 05:28.578
"Buddy?"

05:28.580 --> 05:30.446
Oh, no, we... we weren't buddies.

05:30.448 --> 05:32.549
You... you made my life miserable,

05:32.551 --> 05:34.117
and I'm not even talking
about the little things,

05:34.119 --> 05:35.618
like playing keep away with my hat...

05:35.620 --> 05:36.819
A little game...

05:36.821 --> 05:38.655
Putting that "kick me"
sign on my back...

05:38.657 --> 05:39.689
Classic fun...

05:39.691 --> 05:41.090
Calling me "tiny."

05:41.092 --> 05:43.426
True then, ironic now.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.397
Well, all that was
nothing compared to...

05:47.399 --> 05:48.431
the incident.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.633
Ooh, ominous.

05:50.635 --> 05:52.035
What incident?

05:52.037 --> 05:54.704
He's talking about that time
you glued him to his chair.

05:54.706 --> 05:56.973
No, I never did that.

05:56.975 --> 05:58.208
I swear.

05:58.210 --> 06:01.678
I called you down here
because I need your help.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.779
I'm in here for possession,

06:02.781 --> 06:05.682
but those drugs were planted.

06:05.684 --> 06:06.983
Another thing you say you didn't do.

06:06.985 --> 06:09.052
It seems to be a theme in your life.

06:10.421 --> 06:13.022
There's security footage
that proves I'm innocent.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.324
I remembered your dad was a cop.

06:14.326 --> 06:16.359
I thought maybe he could help get it.

06:16.361 --> 06:19.429
Why didn't your lawyer get the
footage and use it in court?

06:19.431 --> 06:21.064
I got a public defender.

06:21.066 --> 06:23.433
She game me five minutes
and told me to plead out.

06:23.435 --> 06:24.767
You know, they're overworked,

06:24.769 --> 06:28.138
underpaid and not nearly
as hot as they are on TV.

06:29.073 --> 06:31.241
Kyle, it's time for lunch.

06:31.243 --> 06:33.009
Fish sticks.

06:33.011 --> 06:35.979
Oh! My favorite.

06:37.615 --> 06:39.749
Listen, Mike, I got no
one else to turn to.

06:39.751 --> 06:42.552
Please? Talk to your dad?

06:43.888 --> 06:45.688
Hey, I never asked. What
are you in here for?

06:45.690 --> 06:47.557
Triple homicide.

06:47.559 --> 06:48.992
Ah, people make mistakes.

06:48.994 --> 06:50.793
That's why pencils have erasers.

06:56.214 --> 06:59.049
Wow, Elliot. I don't
remember you being so funny.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.351
That's because you're
usually making me cry.

07:03.154 --> 07:05.522
Oh, look at us with this banter.

07:05.524 --> 07:06.990
I'll go get us some more wine.

07:08.526 --> 07:09.693
So how's it going?

07:09.695 --> 07:11.194
You're not going to believe this,

07:11.196 --> 07:12.429
I'm kind of attracted to him.

07:12.431 --> 07:13.563
I mean, he's nice,

07:13.565 --> 07:14.698
he's smart, he's funny.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.468
I can't believe I'm crushing on a nerd.

07:18.470 --> 07:19.870
I think Elliot is cute.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.271
Really?

07:21.273 --> 07:23.373
I don't get these skinny guys.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.476
I need a big guy I can
pretend is a firefighter.

07:26.478 --> 07:28.178
Or a longshoreman.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.048
Or Seattle Seahawks Defensive
End Michael Bennett.

07:33.885 --> 07:36.486
Mm, mm, mm, mm-mm.

07:36.488 --> 07:38.922
I don't care what Coach Carroll says.

07:38.924 --> 07:43.593
Michael, I'm gonna need
you to crash that gap.

07:47.064 --> 07:51.401
So, Elliot. I, Stella,
being of sound mind,

07:51.403 --> 07:54.304
hot body, and only, like, two drinks,

07:54.306 --> 07:56.640
would like to go on a
second date with you.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.210
I'll give you a moment to
not believe your luck.

08:00.212 --> 08:02.579
Yeah, I'm not interested.

08:02.581 --> 08:04.581
Wait, what?

08:04.583 --> 08:08.185
But I like you.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.887
Okay, I see what you're doing.

08:10.889 --> 08:13.523
You're getting back at
me for bullying you.

08:13.525 --> 08:16.593
Well played, sir. Well played.

08:16.595 --> 08:17.694
But now that we're even...

08:17.696 --> 08:19.696
No, it's just that, no offense,

08:19.698 --> 08:21.364
but you're kind of shallow,

08:21.366 --> 08:24.201
and I don't think we
have anything in common.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.670
I don't even know what
we would talk about.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.904
Sorry, Stella.

08:27.906 --> 08:30.106
No, wait! We can talk about stuff.

08:30.108 --> 08:31.374
Nerd stuff.

08:31.376 --> 08:36.046
That wheelchair scientist
with the robot voice!

08:36.048 --> 08:37.746
Sorry, Stel.

08:37.749 --> 08:39.416
Oh, this isn't over.

08:39.418 --> 08:43.119
His rejection just
made me want him more.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.323
Give me a brain makeover.
Make me smarter.

08:46.325 --> 08:47.724
The smart thing would be to accept

08:47.726 --> 08:49.326
his rejection and move on.

08:49.328 --> 08:50.994
Less smart than that.

08:57.335 --> 08:58.368
Great.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.637
You got Kyle's evidence box.

09:00.639 --> 09:03.673
It's got tape on it that
says, "Do not open."

09:03.675 --> 09:06.710
Oops! What do you know?
My knife slipped.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.245
Is that even legal?

09:08.247 --> 09:09.446
Calm down.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.448
I'm friend with Joey
in the evidence room.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.316
He knows better than to rat me out.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.051
I know where all the bodies are buried.

09:17.054 --> 09:19.923
In an abandoned lot next to a pawn shop.

09:21.993 --> 09:23.059
Are those the surveillance tapes?

09:23.061 --> 09:24.060
Yes.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.662
Now, before we get started,

09:25.664 --> 09:27.364
remember our deal.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.500
If help you, you'll let this
whole Kyle thing go, right?

09:30.502 --> 09:32.569
- Never bring it up again.
- Deal.

09:32.571 --> 09:34.070
All right, let's pop in these bad boys

09:34.072 --> 09:36.907
and we'll see if there's
anything useful.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.642
Oh, this brings back memories.

09:38.644 --> 09:41.211
You and me on a stakeout.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.947
I even bought us black
coffee like we used to have.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.682
Nothing an eight year
old likes more than

09:45.684 --> 09:48.385
sitting outside a crack house
drinking black coffee.

09:50.021 --> 09:51.421
I was just trying to toughen you up

09:51.423 --> 09:52.756
so you wouldn't get bullied.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.191
Well, I did get bullied.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.926
Kyle was horrible to me. You
don't know what that's like.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.194
No, the hell I don't.

09:57.196 --> 10:00.230
my old man.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.200
That bastard would get pissed
if I looked at him wrong.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.401
Drove me nuts; I mean,

10:04.403 --> 10:07.337
what's the right way to look at someone?

10:07.339 --> 10:10.807
It's an impossible standard
to impose on a person.

10:10.809 --> 10:13.543
But I didn't complain. I toughened up.

10:13.545 --> 10:16.279
Now I don't feel anything.

10:16.281 --> 10:18.014
And I wanted the same for you.

10:21.653 --> 10:23.220
So anyway, we took credit for catching

10:23.222 --> 10:25.622
the Cedar River Strangler,

10:25.624 --> 10:27.557
but the truth is we don't
know what happened to him.

10:27.559 --> 10:29.860
He died, he moved away,

10:29.862 --> 10:32.262
maybe just got tired of strangling.

10:33.931 --> 10:35.966
You told me that he was still out there,

10:35.968 --> 10:39.169
and he'd get me if I
didn't brush my teeth.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.937
Remember what I'd say?

10:40.939 --> 10:43.340
"The Strangler hates two things:

10:43.342 --> 10:46.776
Tooth decay and drifters."

10:46.778 --> 10:49.112
And you never had a cavity.

10:50.715 --> 10:52.215
Oh, my God. Look at this.

10:52.217 --> 10:55.552
Somebody is planting
drugs in Kyle's desk.

10:55.554 --> 10:56.820
Wow!

10:56.822 --> 10:58.722
I have the evidence to set Kyle free...

10:58.724 --> 11:02.492
somebody I spent my whole life
wishing would end up in jail.

11:02.494 --> 11:04.694
Oh, it's a tough call.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.163
I was in a similar spot once...

11:09.134 --> 11:11.067
Oh, it's from Alice.

11:11.069 --> 11:13.870
Hot dog, donut, explosion,

11:13.872 --> 11:17.107
sleepy face.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.909
I got to go!

11:24.315 --> 11:25.849
I mean, I never thought I'd live to see

11:25.851 --> 11:28.752
the Erdos discrepancy problem solved,

11:28.754 --> 11:30.053
but now we know that two elements

11:30.055 --> 11:32.622
within certain sequences
can grow without bound;

11:32.624 --> 11:33.657
am I right?

11:33.659 --> 11:37.027
You are so right.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.128
Stella, I have to say,

11:38.130 --> 11:39.896
I can't believe how
wrong I was about you.

11:39.898 --> 11:42.032
I'm so glad you insisted
we go out again.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.867
You're incredible.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.402
Well, I'm delighted that you deigned

11:45.404 --> 11:47.337
to give me another chance.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.473
Sometimes people find my intellect...

11:49.475 --> 11:51.908
Intimidating, so I try to hide it.

11:53.744 --> 11:56.713
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Thanks, Grandma.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.315
Don't repeat everything I say.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.383
Don't repeat everything I say.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.953
I haven't repeated anything.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.821
Well, while I...

12:04.823 --> 12:06.723
Do feel like the privatization
of space travel

12:06.725 --> 12:08.725
is a step forward in the long term,

12:08.727 --> 12:12.395
it does make me... uh...

12:12.397 --> 12:14.798
it makes me...

12:14.800 --> 12:17.934
Nostalgic for the glory days of NASA.

12:17.936 --> 12:21.738
Nostalgic for the glory days of NASA.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.541
Oh, no. My phone died.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.877
Uh...

12:26.879 --> 12:28.512
Uh... I know.

12:28.514 --> 12:32.349
You talk smart things for a while.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.251
I did most of mine.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.556
Thanks for the escort, Marcus.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.291
And wasn't I right about the cigarettes?

12:41.293 --> 12:43.193
Aren't you getting a
lot more compliments?

12:43.195 --> 12:44.861
- I am.
- Okay.

12:47.298 --> 12:48.999
And I'm sorry, Martina,

12:49.001 --> 12:51.635
but are you getting prettier every day?

12:51.637 --> 12:53.169
Well, that's the plan.

12:53.171 --> 12:57.107
Just turn it off, Kyle.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.475
Look...

12:58.477 --> 13:00.177
I have the proof that you didn't do it.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.278
Oh, my God, give me that...

13:01.280 --> 13:03.947
First I want the truth
about the glue incident.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.050
Oh, it's the old "give me what I want

13:07.052 --> 13:09.319
and I'll give you what you want."

13:09.321 --> 13:11.855
Popular game here in prison.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.393
The thing is, Mike, I
rather stay in jail

13:16.395 --> 13:17.794
than lie to you.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.263
I didn't do it.

13:20.265 --> 13:22.499
If you didn't do it, then who did?

13:22.501 --> 13:24.367
No idea.

13:24.369 --> 13:25.969
I guess at this point there's no reason

13:25.971 --> 13:27.104
for you to lie about it.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.371
Exactly.

13:28.373 --> 13:32.242
Fine. Here, take it.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.810
Thanks. I owe you one.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.079
And you, modeling, look into it.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.914
Oh. Kyle...

13:37.916 --> 13:39.115
Let's go!

13:41.652 --> 13:43.120
What's with them?

13:43.122 --> 13:44.955
The big guy wanted me to
admit that I glued him

13:44.957 --> 13:47.257
to his chair in fifth grade.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.291
Did you?

13:48.293 --> 13:51.394
I kind of did.

13:51.396 --> 13:53.763
I guess I was a bit of a dick back then.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.565
So why won't you just admit it now?

13:55.567 --> 13:58.034
I guess I'm still a bit of a dick.

14:02.278 --> 14:04.386
So enough about science-y things.

14:04.411 --> 14:08.137
Let's imitate dumb people
and talk about TV.

14:10.171 --> 14:12.539
Well, I just finished
re-watching "Breaking Bad."

14:12.541 --> 14:14.241
Have you seen it?

14:14.243 --> 14:15.642
Of course.

14:15.644 --> 14:17.344
And I definitely think it's a good thing

14:17.346 --> 14:19.346
we nerds came along and made watching TV

14:19.348 --> 14:20.714
feel more like books.

14:23.051 --> 14:25.152
Hello, all. I'm your waitress.

14:25.154 --> 14:28.289
I'm just trying to balance
work and pursuing my dreams.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.790
And your drinks on my tray, of course,

14:29.792 --> 14:33.160
because again, I'm a waitress.

14:33.162 --> 14:34.228
Hi, waitress.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.730
We were just talking
about "Breaking Bad."

14:36.732 --> 14:38.332
Oh, you were in here
the other day saying

14:38.334 --> 14:39.533
that you love "Breaking Bad."

14:39.535 --> 14:41.569
I believe your exact words were:

14:41.571 --> 14:43.437
"Finally a show where
people respect the power

14:43.439 --> 14:45.639
and majesty of chemistry."

14:45.641 --> 14:47.975
Oh, I totally agree. I
loved every second of it.

14:47.977 --> 14:49.743
Well, except for the "Fly"
episode, of course.

14:49.745 --> 14:50.978
Ugh, totally.

14:50.980 --> 14:52.313
Are you kidding me?

14:52.315 --> 14:53.881
The "Fly" episode was a
daring deconstruction

14:53.883 --> 14:54.848
of the show's form,

14:54.850 --> 14:55.883
boiling complex issues down

14:55.885 --> 14:58.152
to a single primal drive.

14:58.154 --> 15:00.554
Really? I think you mean boring.

15:00.556 --> 15:03.724
Boring? I think you're
confusing boring with nuance.

15:03.726 --> 15:05.025
I think you're confusing nuance

15:05.027 --> 15:06.660
with masturbatory filmmaking.

15:06.662 --> 15:10.831
Well, sure it's masturbatory,
but isn't that pleasurable too?

15:10.833 --> 15:12.299
TouchÃ©.

15:15.837 --> 15:16.870
Why, thank you.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.106
Uh, what's happening here?

15:19.108 --> 15:20.708
I mean, seriously, random waitress,

15:20.710 --> 15:22.209
you're poaching my date?

15:22.211 --> 15:24.178
What are you talking about?
We're just talking.

15:24.180 --> 15:25.512
Don't play dumb with me.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.681
That's a game you'll never win.

15:30.418 --> 15:31.685
I wasn't going to say anything,

15:31.687 --> 15:33.120
but now that you're being weird,

15:33.122 --> 15:35.656
obviously this is the way
this story was going to end.

15:35.658 --> 15:37.324
I told her what to say.

15:37.326 --> 15:39.860
It's a classic Cyrano-inspired
Comic-Con Rom-Com.

15:39.862 --> 15:42.863
"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, I'm Shea."

15:42.865 --> 15:44.331
Do you really think we live in a world

15:44.333 --> 15:46.100
where brains are going
to trump sex appeal?

15:46.102 --> 15:48.135
I hope we live in that world.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.603
And clearly this is a man who respects

15:49.605 --> 15:51.538
intelligence and substance.

15:51.540 --> 15:52.673
Hold on a second.

15:52.675 --> 15:55.175
Am I being fought over
by two beautiful women?

15:57.879 --> 16:00.180
This is a new experience.

16:00.182 --> 16:01.882
Although, throughout the animal kingdom,

16:01.884 --> 16:03.417
it's not uncommon for a desirable male

16:03.419 --> 16:06.186
to have more than one mate.

16:06.188 --> 16:08.355
Dude, are you trying
to work a threesome?

16:08.357 --> 16:10.991
Am I? I'm really new at this.

16:12.294 --> 16:16.230
I mean, the... the concept
sounds great, but...

16:16.232 --> 16:17.765
I have enough anxiety with one woman.

16:17.767 --> 16:20.501
I don't think being
outnumbered would help.

16:20.503 --> 16:22.202
You have anxiety?

16:22.204 --> 16:23.871
Generalized, social, or panic disorder?

16:23.873 --> 16:24.838
All of them.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.740
Me too. What do you do for it?

16:26.742 --> 16:29.243
I... I've tried yoga but I don't like...

16:29.245 --> 16:31.478
Being told how to breathe.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.380
You finished my sentence.

16:33.382 --> 16:34.615
No girls has ever done that before.

16:34.617 --> 16:36.717
Okay, you're right.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.419
This is how this ends.

16:38.421 --> 16:41.155
I don't understand all this
talking about stuff anyway.

16:41.157 --> 16:43.624
What are your thoughts on this?
What are your thoughts on that?

16:43.626 --> 16:45.259
Just shut up and feel me up already.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.666
Wait, so now you think the prison guy

16:52.668 --> 16:54.001
didn't do the glue thing?

16:54.003 --> 16:55.102
Then who did? I don't know,

16:55.104 --> 16:57.571
but it's making me crazy.

16:57.573 --> 16:59.974
So how did it go with Kyle?

16:59.976 --> 17:01.108
He still says he didn't do it.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.109
I guess I believe him.

17:02.111 --> 17:03.978
Well, let that be the end of it.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.747
- No, no, no.
- Kenny Robinson.

17:06.749 --> 17:09.183
He ate glue, so I know he had it.

17:09.185 --> 17:11.919
Mike, you promised you'd
let this thing go.

17:11.921 --> 17:14.722
Let's just find out where Kenny
lives and stake him out.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.390
I'll bring the black coffee, and you...

17:16.392 --> 17:17.892
Mike, damn it, stop!

17:17.894 --> 17:20.661
No good ever comes from people
digging into their pasts.

17:20.663 --> 17:23.396
My whole career, but go on.

17:24.366 --> 17:26.233
- Just let it go.
- Why?

17:26.234 --> 17:27.568
- Because I said so.
- Why?

17:27.569 --> 17:29.770
Because Kyle did it, okay?

17:29.772 --> 17:33.540
The glue, the chair, the whole thing.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.644
You knew all along, and
you didn't say anything.

17:36.646 --> 17:38.279
Wow, this is some "Pretty Little Liars"

17:38.281 --> 17:39.947
going on here.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.730
I can't believe this.
You knew Kyle did it.

17:45.037 --> 17:46.879
The school called that day
and asked if I wanted

17:46.904 --> 17:48.338
to make a formal complaint,

17:48.372 --> 17:49.572
and I said to forget about it.

17:49.607 --> 17:51.241
- Stella...
- Yeah, I know the drill.

17:51.275 --> 17:52.709
You guys are gonna yell at each other.

17:52.743 --> 17:55.678
Let me know who wins.
Good night, Grandpa.

17:55.713 --> 17:57.914
Good night, honey. Sweet dreams.

17:57.948 --> 17:59.883
What the hell are you
gonna yell at me for?

17:59.917 --> 18:01.985
Because you knew about this
and you didn't tell me!

18:02.019 --> 18:04.487
Because you could have
protected me and you didn't!

18:04.522 --> 18:06.589
I was protecting you.

18:06.624 --> 18:08.758
If people knew you got
Kyle into trouble,

18:08.793 --> 18:11.027
you would have turned into that kid,

18:11.062 --> 18:13.663
and that kid gets beat up every day.

18:13.698 --> 18:16.132
So instead, I signed you
up for boxing lessons.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.536
Where I got beat up every day.

18:19.570 --> 18:22.505
But you stuck with it, and
you got big and strong.

18:22.540 --> 18:24.774
- So you're welcome.
- You want me to thank you?

18:24.809 --> 18:26.509
Because what I did made you stronger.

18:26.544 --> 18:29.345
But to get there you let me
feel humiliated and alone.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.680
Do you ever stop whining?

18:30.715 --> 18:32.082
Do you ever stop being a mean old prick?

18:32.116 --> 18:33.550
This is great!

18:33.584 --> 18:35.018
Not now, Martina.

18:35.052 --> 18:36.519
See how alike you two are?

18:36.554 --> 18:38.388
Don't say that!

18:39.924 --> 18:41.658
What's great is that
we're finally getting

18:41.692 --> 18:43.927
at the core issues.

18:43.961 --> 18:47.263
Honey, you want to pretend that
time in your life never existed,

18:47.298 --> 18:51.101
you want some apology that's
gonna make it all seem better,

18:51.135 --> 18:53.870
but the way to truly put it behind you

18:53.904 --> 18:56.473
is to embrace what that time taught you

18:56.507 --> 18:59.109
and love that scared
little boy inside you.

18:59.143 --> 19:00.477
I don't love that little boy.

19:00.511 --> 19:03.279
That's why there are no
pictures of that little boy.

19:05.616 --> 19:06.716
There is one.

19:08.819 --> 19:11.388
I've had it since you were 11.

19:11.422 --> 19:14.624
I keep it in my wallet.

19:14.658 --> 19:16.826
Why?

19:16.861 --> 19:18.995
Because I did love that little boy.

19:21.165 --> 19:22.465
Dad...

19:22.500 --> 19:23.900
Look...

19:23.934 --> 19:25.935
maybe I made some mistakes,

19:25.970 --> 19:28.671
and what I did could have turned
out badly for a lot of kids,

19:28.706 --> 19:29.906
but not you!

19:29.940 --> 19:31.841
I mean, look how good you turned out.

19:31.876 --> 19:35.412
And that's on you.

19:35.446 --> 19:40.216
I guess in your... your own strange way,

19:40.251 --> 19:44.387
I know you were looking
out for me, so...

19:44.422 --> 19:46.356
All right, I accept your apology.

19:46.390 --> 19:48.425
I didn't apologize.

19:51.128 --> 19:52.529
Yes, you did.

19:55.332 --> 19:58.768
So you don't have to deny it anymore.

19:58.803 --> 20:00.270
You did it.

20:00.304 --> 20:03.640
I kind of did.

20:03.674 --> 20:05.642
Well, I'm a grown man,

20:05.676 --> 20:07.911
and revenge is ultimately unsatisfying,

20:07.945 --> 20:09.245
so I only ask one thing, Kyle.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.848
Buy me a beer.

20:11.882 --> 20:13.416
Happy to do it, buddy.

20:21.926 --> 20:24.194
You glued me to the chair, didn't you?

20:24.228 --> 20:26.963
- I kind of did.

20:28.866 --> 20:30.267
Revenge is ultimately unsatisfying,

20:30.301 --> 20:33.136
but it's still fun.

20:33.170 --> 20:36.172
You just lost yourself a
free beer, my friend!

20:38.008 --> 20:39.376
Today would have been a terrific day

20:39.410 --> 20:41.578
to wear underwear.

20:44.849 --> 20:47.684
All right, people, prepare
yourself for a show

20:47.718 --> 20:50.453
my last girlfriend called...

20:50.488 --> 20:52.055
adequate.
