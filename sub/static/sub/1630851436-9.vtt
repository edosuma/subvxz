- $6 for a shirt?

00:51.117 --> 00:52.185
- Isn't that what shirts cost?

00:52.252 --> 00:54.054
- $9 dollars for pants?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.722
- How much cheaper could pants
possibly be?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.624
- Excuse me, ma'am,
if you're interested,

00:57.724 --> 00:59.092
we have this rack over here

00:59.192 --> 01:00.226
for a dollar a shirt,

01:00.293 --> 01:01.528
- The Reject Rack?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.096
- No, we're not
Reject Rack people.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.798
- We actually are
Reject Rack people.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.099
- No, we're pretty classy.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.767
- I would like
to check these out.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.135
- Who would wear these?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.804
- Tom, look at this one.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.739
"My other T-shirt
is a jean jacket."

01:12.806 --> 01:14.040
- I can't wear that to school.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.408
I'll be laughed
out of the place.

01:15.475 --> 01:18.445
- Tom, Count Chocula
on a skateboard.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.146
- Mom, Mom, these T-shirts
are terrible.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.148
- Oh, buddy. "Here's the beef."

01:22.248 --> 01:24.651
And it's got an arrow
pointing down to your crotch.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.420
- These clothes have been
rejected by society.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.655
- Tom, they're a dollar.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.156
Now go pick your favorite ten,

01:30.256 --> 01:31.958
and your wardrobe's all set
for the next year.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.326
- They're all equally bad.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.428
- Pick your favorite ten
of the equally bad ones.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.230
I hope you can find
some winners.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.133
- Hey, Nelson,
can I ask you a question?

01:40.233 --> 01:41.568
What's your honest take
on this shirt?

01:41.634 --> 01:43.002
- Oh, Tom, it's a look.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.571
It's definitely a look.
- Yeah?

01:44.637 --> 01:46.473
- But this one might be
a little bit too much.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.108
- I should've worn
the Mitt Romney one.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.576
Dakota, what do you think?

01:49.642 --> 01:51.010
- Oh, wow.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.780
I can't tell if I'm offended
or I'm really impressed.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.348
- Offended?
The guy at the thrift shop

01:55.448 --> 01:57.450
clearly said,
"No nips, no problem."

01:57.517 --> 01:58.852
- I think as we get older,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.020
one thing you're gonna look
back on is

02:01.121 --> 02:02.789
which adults you listened to.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.091
- Okay, gang.
Today we are playing kickball.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.293
So I need you to split up
into two teams--

02:07.360 --> 02:08.761
wait, hold on a second.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.164
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

02:11.264 --> 02:14.167
Not in my class.
- Oh, the T-shirt?

02:14.267 --> 02:16.169
Is it--you don't like the--
the partial nudity?

02:16.269 --> 02:17.370
- Think I care
about nudity, boy?

02:17.470 --> 02:18.838
- No.
- I will not have

02:18.938 --> 02:20.540
a student of mine
wearing a Red Sox garment.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.975
- Oh, the Red Sox.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.309
- In this class,
we are Yankee fans.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.044
- Oh, no, I'm not
a fan of anything.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.113
It's just a random
thrift shop purchase.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.648
- Tom, the playoffs are
coming up

02:28.715 --> 02:30.183
and I can't afford you
to jinx it.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.718
The shirt's gotta go.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.620
- What do you--you want me
to remove my--my shirt?

02:33.686 --> 02:35.455
- Take it off.
- No, I can't take it off.

02:35.522 --> 02:36.890
I mean--
- Oh, you're taking it off.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.391
Tell you what,
you don't take it off--

02:38.491 --> 02:39.826
- Please. Please.
- I'ma take it off for you.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.294
That's right. Come here.
- Stop, stop.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.729
- This is a new low,
even for our school.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.230
- Go ahead. Film it.
Everybody film it.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.066
I want the world to know
that Boston sucks.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.902
Now give me this shirt. Yes!

02:49.002 --> 02:51.037
- You're out of control, Coach.
- I'm not.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.206
This is what I think
of your Red Sox around here.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.507
- Oh, my god.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.342
- Now watch it burn, kids.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.344
Watch it burn.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.083
- I'm on the field
where earlier today,

03:04.184 --> 03:07.053
an enraged sports fan
burned the shirt of a student.

03:07.153 --> 03:09.255
Here's a clip of the horror
as it unfolded.

03:09.355 --> 03:15.161
- Tom, you sit in the corner
and you watch this shirt burn.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.095
Damn it.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.564
- Can you even imagine

03:17.664 --> 03:19.933
what was going on
in this maniac's mind?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.568
I know I can't.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.037
This shirtless child should act
as a reminder to us all

03:24.103 --> 03:27.106
<i>that hey, it's just a game.</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:28.942
- Okay, I know how this looks,
everybody,

03:29.042 --> 03:31.945
but that clip was
taken out of context.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.279
- Was it?
- Yes.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.114
They didn't show
any of the kickball stuff.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.382
- This is bad, okay?

03:36.449 --> 03:38.284
We can't be teaching kids
how to hate.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.086
- I don't get
where it comes from myself.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.122
My Uncle Bill is from Boston,
and he's a really sweet guy.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.791
- Uncle Bill sound
like a damn fool.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.960
- Why? Based on what?
- He just sounds like a idiot.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.795
- Okay.
This is what I'm talking about.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.797
Let's make this
a teachable moment.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.232
- Teachable moment? How?
- How?

03:52.298 --> 03:53.633
- Yeah, how?
- I'll tell you how.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.969
We do a field trip
to a Red Sox game,

03:56.069 --> 03:58.304
and we show these kids
that no matter where you go,

03:58.404 --> 04:00.139
people are basically the same.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.274
- We gotta go on field trips?

04:01.374 --> 04:03.076
Or how about we just say sorry?

04:03.142 --> 04:05.078
What happened to that?
Look, look, watch me.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.813
Sorry, Tom. Whoops!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.047
- That felt insincere at best.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.215
- Sounds lazy.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.784
- I was sincere as a mother--

04:11.884 --> 04:13.653
- Oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh!

04:13.753 --> 04:14.988
Listen, it's decided.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.556
The kids are going
to a Red Sox game,

04:16.623 --> 04:18.825
and Coach, you're gonna
be their chaperone.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.326
- What?
- Oh, that's fun.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.495
That'll be great.
- Ugh. Okay, fine. I'll go.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.896
But I'm just letting
y'all know,

04:23.963 --> 04:25.832
I refuse to enjoy myself.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.834
- That's fair.
That's a good compromise.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.305
<i>♪ ♪</i>

04:32.405 --> 04:36.009

04:36.109 --> 04:38.311
<i>Babe Ruth first signed

04:38.411 --> 04:40.313

We're in Boston. Here we go.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.748
- Yeah, I'm excited. Come on.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.082
- Look at you guys.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.351
What a symbol
of unity and harmony.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.020
Have fun today.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.087
- Thanks, Bus Driver.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.822
- All right, let's go.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.357
- You know what? I can't do it.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.026
- Can't do what?
- Now that we're here,

04:53.126 --> 04:54.927
I just can't let my shoes touch
Red Sox asphalt.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.029
- Come on, Coach.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.597
We drove three
and a half hours.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.931
- We're here to take
a picture of me and you

04:58.998 --> 05:00.533
hugging at Fenway, so...
- Hugging?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.101
Listen, I ain't hugging shit.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.536
- What?
- Go without me.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.204
- Yeah, but we've gotta see
the trip through.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.373
You can't say
"I'm not hugging shit."

05:07.473 --> 05:09.042
- Uh, the bus driver will
take you.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.943
Y'all--y'all go
with the bus driver.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.445
- Does he even count
as a grownup?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.047
- He's more of, like,
a man child, right?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.482
- How about this?
Nelson, turn on the video call,

05:16.549 --> 05:19.052
and you just check in with me,
and I'll see it from here.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.321
- Man, come on, Coach.
- Please stop talking about it.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.723
Get off this bus
and go in there and do

05:23.823 --> 05:27.060
whatever the teachable nonsense
y'all supposed to be doing.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.495
- I don't think you understood
the premise of the trip.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.230
I really don't.
- Whee!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.632
Coach, we are good!
- Hey, Coach.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.800
- Look at this. Wow.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.635
<i>- All right. Look at you guys.</i>

05:35.702 --> 05:37.303
<i>I knew y'all could do it.
I knew it.</i>

05:37.370 --> 05:39.072
- Very safe. Very safe.
- That fresh Boston air.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.506
Who knew?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.408
- Uh-oh. Oh man, look.
<i>- Look at what?</i>

05:42.508 --> 05:43.910
- What kind of asshole lunatic

05:44.010 --> 05:46.012
shows up to a Sox game
in a Yankee cap?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.313
- Oh, no.
- This is not good.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.681
<i>- Wait, what's not good?</i>

05:48.748 --> 05:51.417
- Yes, yes, I'm wearing
a Yankees cap.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.419
How about no swearing
in front of the kids?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.655
Maybe switching it up
and saying "tush" or "heinie."

05:55.722 --> 05:57.156
- Okay, fine.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.859
Do you want us to shove
that cap up your "tush"?

05:59.926 --> 06:01.227
Or up your "heinie"?

06:01.327 --> 06:03.262
Or straight up your asshole?
- Oh!

06:03.363 --> 06:04.931
- Yeah, you can't say
the last part.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.599
I mean, that defeats
the whole purpose.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.934
Hey, what--
- Oh, no.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.603
<i>- Oh, no?</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:12.739
- Don't take his pants off.
<i>- What--whose pants?</i>

06:12.839 --> 06:14.073
<i>What is happening out there?</i>

06:14.173 --> 06:15.408
- Coach, you gotta
get out here now.

06:15.508 --> 06:16.776
<i>- For what?</i>
- Kids, run!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.544
- Run for your lives.
- Go, go, go!

06:18.611 --> 06:20.079
<i>- Where is the bus driver?</i>

06:20.179 --> 06:21.280
- Can somebody open
the dumpster?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.615
- In retrospect, I agree

06:22.715 --> 06:24.550
I was a poor choice
of a chaperone!

06:25.852 --> 06:28.721
- I am freaking out.
We do not have a chaperone.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.289
- All right, don't panic.
Everyone's panicking.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.891
- We need to pick
a de facto leader.

06:31.958 --> 06:32.959
- How about me?
- You?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.293
- What? No, Tom.
- No. No.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.361
- No, no, hear me out.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.796
I know the ball boy here.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.131
- What?
- Wh--so?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.700
- My Uncle Bill
is a senior ball boy.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.802
- Isn't that, like,
a volunteer position?

06:42.902 --> 06:44.604
- The important thing is,
I've got a contact,

06:44.704 --> 06:45.905
so let me call the guy.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.440
- All right.
- All right, here you go.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.743
<i>- Tommy.</i>
- Hey, Uncle Bill.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.044
It's Tom from New Jersey.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.880
- Why does he have to say
where he's from?

06:53.946 --> 06:55.148
<i>- Listen, I can't talk now.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:56.649
<i>I'm taking a dump.</i>
- What?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.084
<i>- I can't get off
the can, Tommy!</i>

06:58.151 --> 06:59.318
- Uncle Bill,
please don't hang up.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.987
No, no, no.
<i>-</i>

07:01.954 --> 07:03.990
- Who answers a FaceTime call
while you're shitting?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.324
- Yeah.
- You know what?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.759
I just thought of something.
- Yeah?

07:06.826 --> 07:07.994
- My dad knows
the owner of the team.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.262
- What?

07:09.328 --> 07:10.663
- You should have
mentioned that sooner.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.998
- Yeah!

07:12.098 --> 07:13.232
- Your dad knows the owner
of the Red Sox.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.333
- That's correct.
- Yeah.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.735
As soon as I said "ball boy,"

07:15.802 --> 07:17.503
you should have offered
all this up.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.007
- Name?
- Nelson.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.675
My dad is friends
with the owner.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.676
Defended him once in court.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.311
- I got a Nelson out here.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.647
Yeah, he says his dad
defended you once in court.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.015
Yeah, I got it.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.250
Yeah, no can do.
He says your dad's an asshole.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.587
- Oh, my dad put a much better
spin on the whole friendship.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.290
- Sir, I can't imagine
this is gonna have much sway,

07:37.356 --> 07:40.593
but my Uncle Bill is actually
a ball boy here at the stadium.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.995
- Wait a second.
Your uncle is Enormous Bill?

07:43.095 --> 07:45.097
- Yeah, I mean, he is enormous.
- I had no idea

07:45.164 --> 07:46.632
that Enormous Bill
even had a family.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.100
- Oh, yeah.
- He's a legend here.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.302
You know what?
- That's great.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.436
- Come on in here.
- Wow.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.171
I didn't expect that to work.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.040
- Hey, guys, this is
Enormous Bill's nephew.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.708
- No way.
You talking about Loner Bill?

07:55.808 --> 07:58.110
- No, he's got a family.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.278
- This is incredible.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.780
- You must be Tom.
- I am.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.282
- Your Uncle Bill is
a real character.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.684
- I can't believe you know
my Uncle Bill.

08:04.784 --> 08:05.952
- Yeah, messes up
the bathrooms,

08:06.018 --> 08:07.553
but he is beloved around here.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.188
Everybody loves him.
- Yeah, my uncle's a fun guy.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.389
Oh, and this is
my good buddy Nelson.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.691
I think you know his dad.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.059
- This is the kid
with the asshole father?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.527
- What?
- Get him outta here.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.895
Can someone have
this kid removed?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.396
- Wait, gets your hands
off of me!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.999
Back in Jersey,
people find me adorable!

08:20.066 --> 08:22.068
- So, Tom,
wearing a Yankee cap?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.402
That's a bold choice, son.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.971
- Oh, no, no.
We're on a field trip.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.206
My teacher had burned
my Red Sox jersey,

08:27.306 --> 08:29.909
so this is a field trip
to learn about tolerance.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.644
- Wait a minute.
You're the boy from the video.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.179
- That's me.
- The shirtless idiot.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.047
- No, no one calls me that,
but, I mean...

08:35.147 --> 08:36.749
- You are a legend, sir.
- That's good.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.885
- That story shone
such a bright

08:38.985 --> 08:41.921
and necessary light
on a very real problem.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.689
- It's true.
People can be maniacs.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.091
- I'd like to shake
your hand, Tom.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.659
- Actually,
this is why I came here.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.261
Dakota, get a picture of this.
This is good.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.429
- Great.
- Just shaking hands.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.931
- It's great. I got it.
- This is great.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.266
You know what?
- Yeah?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.101
- I'm gonna do you one better.
- Okay.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.503
- Linda, tell Casey Affleck
he's bumped.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.871
Tom here, the shirtless idiot,

08:58.938 --> 09:00.273
he's throwing out
the first pitch.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.908
- I'm on it,
but I'm not telling the guy.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.509
You tell him.
- Me? Oh, no, no.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.244
I'm not good on the phone.
- Hey, this is Casey.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.179
- Hey, Casey Affleck. It's Tom.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.782
Sounds like you're out
and I'm in, so...

09:09.882 --> 09:11.250
- And who the fuck
are you, Tom?

09:11.350 --> 09:13.286
- Just Tom from Jersey.
Bassoon player--

09:13.386 --> 09:15.388
- What are you talking about?
- Pooped my pants once.

09:15.454 --> 09:16.789
- This is bush-league!
- You know what?

09:16.889 --> 09:19.058
I don't have time to talk.
I gotta go.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.359
- Great. It's done.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.228
- I don't think the fans
wanna see me.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.729
I don't have any fans.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.631
<i>- All right, Boston fans,
in ten minutes,</i>

09:25.731 --> 09:28.968
<i>we've got the shirtless idiot
throwing the first pitch.</i>

09:32.305 --> 09:33.706
- Okay, Tom, you're here.

09:33.773 --> 09:34.974
This is gonna be
so much fun, right?

09:35.074 --> 09:36.442
- Yes. All right.
- Okay.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.977
- This will be fun.
- Listen to me here.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.278
We got ten minutes.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.580
When the light flashes,
we're live.

09:40.646 --> 09:41.814
- Okay.
- Wave to the crowd.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.215
Say something cute.
- What?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.317
- Then fire a fastball.
- Fastball?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.785
- And make sure you land it.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.154
You cannot pull a 50 Cent
or a Mariah Carey.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.156
- You know, I don't do well
in high-pressure situations.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.490
- Oh, God.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.092
- Can I run to the bathroom
real quick?

09:53.159 --> 09:55.595
- Okay. But hurry.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

09:56.729 --> 09:58.764
- Everybody,
move off to the sides.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.499
We got
the honorary first pitcher,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.501
and he's gotta take a pee.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.837
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Hey. What the hell?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.973
- A Yankee cap in Fenway?
- Oh, oh, that.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.641
We're on a peace summit
of sorts.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.576
- You better start to pee-pee
right now.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.478
- Come on, guys, please.
This is a lot of pressure.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.113
One, two, three.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.414
- Guys, please, I can't pee--
- Four, five.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.649
- With the countdown.
- Seven.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.651
- Can you please?
- C'mon!

10:18.751 --> 10:20.286
- I can't imagine any urine's
about to come out of me.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.687
- All right, come here.
Help me grab this kid.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.189
- No, no, no.
- Come here!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.357
- You had your chance.
- This is socially--

10:24.457 --> 10:25.625
- Now get outta here!

10:25.691 --> 10:28.127
- Tommy. Holy shit.
Is that you?

10:28.194 --> 10:29.528
- Oh, Uncle Bill. Hey.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.964
- Oh, my God. Come here.
This kid's my nephew.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.200
Give me a hug, you big
goofy-looking son of a bitch.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.801
Come here.
- Hey. Oh, whoa, whoa.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.203
-
- Not in the bathroom.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.204
Uncle Bill, it's too much.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.039
Listen, it's a long story,

10:40.139 --> 10:42.375
but I'm actually throwing out
the first pitch of the game.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.843
- Wow.
- And I needed to pee first.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.277
It's an emergency.
I gotta find a bathroom.

10:45.344 --> 10:46.879
- Okay. Okay. Listen, listen.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.714
As the senior most ball boy
here, I got full access.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.149
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, come on.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.550
Come on, I'll show you.
- Oh, my god.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.852
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.220
Sorry. He's under my watch.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.621
- Well, listen,
I hate to pull rank here,

10:55.688 --> 10:58.290
but ball boy
outranks security guard.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.792
- Ah, I don't know, Bill.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.394
- Does ball boy
outrank anything?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.229
- There's no time to argue.
We gotta pee. Come on!

11:03.329 --> 11:04.797
♪ We're gonna make a pee-pee ♪

11:04.864 --> 11:06.232
♪ We're gonna make
a pee-pee-pee-pee ♪

11:06.332 --> 11:08.134
♪ We're gonna make a pee-pee ♪

11:08.200 --> 11:10.202
All right, Tommy.
See that grass out there?

11:10.302 --> 11:11.337
- Yeah?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.205
- That grass is all yours.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.044
- Oh, thank you so much.
This is perfect.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.712
- Anywhere you want.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.314
- Oh, this is a pleasure.
Oh, thank you, Uncle Bill.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.084
- You're welcome, man.
- Bro, what the eff, man?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.686
- Oh, oh, I'm good.
I'm with Uncle Bill.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.654
- No, you're not good.
What are you doing?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.356
- I'm with Uncle Bill, I said.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.893
- You're pissing on Babe Ruth's
original mitt from 1914.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.095
- Oh, no.
- Look at this kid.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.363
He's pissing on Ruth's mitt.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.831
- What the hell?

11:38.898 --> 11:41.067
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- You suck!

11:41.167 --> 11:43.035
- No. Honest mistake.
I meant no disrespect.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.837
- This is the ultimate
disrespect, you little shit.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.672
- Oh, no, if we blame anyone,
I mean, let's blame

11:46.739 --> 11:48.841
Casey Affleck, right?
Right, Uncle Bill?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.710
- Uncle? No.
I never met this kid.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.411
I'm the senior Ball Boy.
I got stuff to do.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.747
- Uncle Bill.
- Get him, guys!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.722
- Get in here. Get in here.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.392
I got a text saying
that our very own Tom

12:06.459 --> 12:09.061
is going to throw out
the first pitch at Fenway!

12:09.128 --> 12:11.564
Are you shitting me?

12:11.630 --> 12:13.265
<i>- Sad day at Fenway</i>

12:13.365 --> 12:16.102
<i>as there will be no
ceremonial first pitch thrown.</i>

12:16.202 --> 12:19.238
<i>A child named Tom was
scheduled to participate,</i>

12:19.305 --> 12:21.140
<i>but instead,
he pulled out his wiener</i>

12:21.240 --> 12:22.975
<i>and urinated
on Babe Ruth's mitt,</i>

12:23.075 --> 12:24.477
<i>further enflaming tensions...</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:25.978
- Well, that was disappointing.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.546
That's why I don't like
to get excited.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.081
<i>- And there he is,
the little maniac</i>

12:29.148 --> 12:30.883
<i>that urinated
on Babe Ruth's mitt.</i>

12:30.950 --> 12:33.452
<i>This child right here,
in a nutshell,</i>

12:33.552 --> 12:35.588
<i>is what's wrong with sports.</i>
