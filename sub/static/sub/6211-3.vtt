WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.302
and you're just the guy
to write it, Harvey. squad,

00:04.370 --> 00:05.837
Don't worry, it'll be fun.

00:05.872 --> 00:06.471
"It'll be fun."

00:06.606 --> 00:07.973
I need to
use the phone.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.073
Wrap it up, lady.

00:09.141 --> 00:11.175
Oh, that's just our lonely,
crazy neighbor.

00:11.243 --> 00:13.411
He came over to borrow
more tinfoil for his hat.

00:13.478 --> 00:14.512
Huh?

00:14.614 --> 00:16.114
I'll talk to you
at school.

00:16.215 --> 00:17.282
Hey!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.150
It's my turn--
this isn't fair.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.186
Write a letter to PETA.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.355
Yes...

00:23.389 --> 00:26.324
I'd like to order
a dozen long-stem roses

00:26.392 --> 00:28.460
for Principal Willard Kraft

00:28.494 --> 00:29.894
at Westbridge
High School.

00:29.962 --> 00:30.995
<i>Yes,</i> I've met him.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.964
Roses?
Did he die?

00:33.032 --> 00:34.099
I just like him.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.300
That's a shame,
now that he's passed on.

00:36.335 --> 00:37.802
Well, enough
with the boohoo.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.904
Pass me the phone.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.439
Hey!

00:41.507 --> 00:43.308
Why are you so anxious to talk
on the phone, anyway?

00:43.376 --> 00:46.611
I need to call in
to Nick Bakay's sports
show on ESPN Radio.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.313
All he ever talks about
is the Buffalo Bills,

00:49.381 --> 00:51.816
and his voice-- Lord,
is it is annoying.

00:51.884 --> 00:53.451
Well, I'm sure
whatever Aunt Hilda's
talking about

00:53.519 --> 00:54.752
is much more important
than <i>that.</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:56.621
Yes, I'd like
to reserve a floor buffer.

00:56.722 --> 00:58.055
Great!

00:58.091 --> 00:58.856
Ta.

00:58.924 --> 00:59.958
Finally.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.993
I tell you, I'm sick
of being the only guy

01:02.061 --> 01:03.361
in a house full of hens.

01:03.429 --> 01:05.196
Ooh... that's
going to cost you.

01:06.699 --> 01:07.732
( <i>gasps</i> )

01:07.800 --> 01:09.500
Oh, turn me back!

01:09.569 --> 01:11.102
Turn me back!

01:39.031 --> 01:41.532
(thunder crashing)

01:45.303 --> 01:46.304
The Other Realm
announced

01:46.372 --> 01:47.572
that they'll
pay cash money

01:47.640 --> 01:48.940
for each empty
potion bottle.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.641
Got any?

01:50.709 --> 01:53.978
No, I have this strange ritual
I perform with empty things.

01:54.046 --> 01:55.313
I throw them away.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.815
Well, I'm sure there's some
in the basement.

01:56.882 --> 01:58.382
I mean, if there's
half as much glassware

01:58.450 --> 02:01.552
as mouse droppings,
this witch is Aruba-bound.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.922
Why is it as soon as I get
out all my winter clothes

02:03.990 --> 02:05.756
we suddenly get
stupid Indian summer?

02:05.824 --> 02:07.158
I believe the
correct term is

02:07.226 --> 02:08.893
"stupid Native
American summer."

02:08.961 --> 02:10.762
You're going
to get a break

02:10.829 --> 02:12.830
with this unseasonably
warm weather, Sabrina.

02:12.898 --> 02:14.933
Brad's witch-hunting
gene will be dormant.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.135
Yeah, besides the fact
that you'll be wearing wool

02:17.202 --> 02:19.470
during a heat wave,
it should be an easy week.

02:19.538 --> 02:20.705
Sabrina, you've got mail.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.374
Maybe Valerie
finally tore herself

02:22.441 --> 02:24.476
away from her new friends,
to write me.

02:24.543 --> 02:25.710
Oh, great.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.446
Mr. Kraft just gave me detention
over the computer!

02:28.514 --> 02:29.447
What did you do?

02:29.514 --> 02:30.815
Breathe.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.651
You know, something
has been bothering
Willard lately.

02:33.719 --> 02:35.619
I think I'm going
to have him over

02:35.687 --> 02:36.888
for lunch today.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.656
Maybe some tuna salad
and cole slaw

02:38.724 --> 02:40.992
will help him reveal
his true feelings.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.393
And I shall happily take refuge

02:42.461 --> 02:44.262
in the damp squalor
we call a basement.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.696
SABRINA:
You know,
Aunt Zelda

02:45.764 --> 02:46.865
I think it's a great idea

02:46.932 --> 02:48.166
to have Mr. Kraft over
for lunch.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.400
That'll be 45 minutes
where he can't

02:49.468 --> 02:50.602
make my life miserable.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.105
He's always nice to me.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.707
HARVEY:
<i>So, have you heard</i>

02:55.775 --> 02:56.675
from Valerie?

02:56.742 --> 02:57.909
Yeah,
she's doing great.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.344
Apparently,
Disneyland isn't

02:59.378 --> 03:01.613
"the happiest place
on earth"-- Anchorage is.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.615
Well, don't tell
the people in Juneau.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.317
Hey, I decided to do that
sports article for you.

03:06.385 --> 03:08.253
Great, let's talk money--
there is none.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.521
You got yourself a deal

03:09.588 --> 03:11.790
except that I'm going to
need some help writing it.

03:11.857 --> 03:12.958
Oh, I'll be glad
to help.

03:13.025 --> 03:13.958
It'll be fun

03:14.026 --> 03:15.659
and it'll take my mind
off Valerie.

03:15.727 --> 03:17.529
But I already asked
Brad to help me.

03:17.596 --> 03:18.263
What?

03:18.331 --> 03:19.331
Don't worry.

03:19.398 --> 03:20.364
He's a great writer.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.299
He won a contest
in the second grade.

03:22.367 --> 03:24.869
Oh, well, maybe you can fit
his "trip to grandma's"

03:24.936 --> 03:25.870
into the article.

03:25.938 --> 03:26.937
What's up, guys?

03:27.005 --> 03:29.307
Hey, so, did you tell
her about my idea yet?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.274
HARVEY:
Hey, Brad thinks

03:30.342 --> 03:31.609
we should interview
the towel boys

03:31.677 --> 03:32.610
promise anonymity

03:32.678 --> 03:34.144
and get a real, inside look
at the team.

03:34.212 --> 03:36.247
Oh, that's
an interesting idea...

03:36.315 --> 03:37.681
unfortunately.

03:37.749 --> 03:39.049
We're on it.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.452
What's that saying--

03:41.520 --> 03:43.521
"two's company,
three's pathetic"?

03:43.589 --> 03:44.556
( <i>chuckles</i> )

03:45.924 --> 03:49.260
Whenever Mr. Kraft talks,
he spews verbal anthrax.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.629
Valerie would've loved
that line...

03:51.697 --> 03:54.866
and I wouldn't be talking
to myself right now.

03:57.903 --> 03:59.504
Wasn't this
a nice idea?

03:59.571 --> 04:01.472
You get a home-
cooked lunch

04:01.540 --> 04:03.441
and we get
a chance to...

04:03.509 --> 04:05.176
talk.

04:05.244 --> 04:06.611
What is this, the inquisition?

04:06.645 --> 04:08.746
Look, Willard, I know
something's been bothering you.

04:08.814 --> 04:09.914
Whoa-ho-ho, look at the time.

04:09.948 --> 04:10.848
I got to run.

04:10.916 --> 04:13.451
Those kids don't yell
at themselves.

04:13.519 --> 04:16.053
Well, at least let me put a
sandwich in a bag for you.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.158
Well, I do love tuna.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.496
I can't get Willard to talk.

04:25.564 --> 04:27.265
You've done wonders with him.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.168
You think I should cast
an honest-and-vulnerable spell?

04:30.236 --> 04:30.969
Yes.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.136
It'll make his feelings

04:32.204 --> 04:34.205
as open as his mouth is
when he's chewing.

04:34.273 --> 04:35.840
I'll do it.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.409
Here's your sandwich.

04:38.477 --> 04:39.710
Thank you-- got to run.

04:39.778 --> 04:40.778
Are you sure
you don't want

04:40.846 --> 04:42.646
to tell me
what's been bothering you?

04:42.714 --> 04:44.949
It's Wally.

04:45.017 --> 04:45.616
Wally?

04:45.684 --> 04:46.651
My brother.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.585
Sure, I got
the good name

04:47.653 --> 04:49.554
but he got
everything else--

04:49.655 --> 04:53.457
looks, charm...
a personality.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.159
Now he's coming
to visit.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.129
Well, so, you'll put up with him
for a few days,

04:58.196 --> 05:00.698
and then say good-bye
to perfect Pete.

05:00.766 --> 05:01.732
No, it's "Wally"

05:01.800 --> 05:03.401
and you don't
understand.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.737
He's stolen every
girlfriend I've ever had

05:05.804 --> 05:08.005
and many that I just
claimed to have.

05:08.073 --> 05:10.107
Oh, Willard,
you're not worried.

05:10.175 --> 05:11.475
Oh, you're just...

05:11.543 --> 05:14.111
you're so breathtakingly
beautiful.

05:14.179 --> 05:16.047
He's going to want
to steal <i>you.</i>

05:16.115 --> 05:18.650
Oh, you're so vulnerable...

05:18.717 --> 05:22.286
and so honest.

05:23.288 --> 05:24.855
HILDA:
How did it go?

05:24.923 --> 05:26.257
Wonderfully.

05:26.358 --> 05:27.992
Did you remove
the spell?

05:28.059 --> 05:29.027
No.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.096
I like him honest
and vulnerable.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.031
Besides, what could it hurt?

05:33.098 --> 05:35.633
...and, sometimes,
when I sleep at night,

05:35.701 --> 05:37.802
I am so consumed
with self-doubt

05:37.870 --> 05:39.236
that I suck my thumb.

05:40.772 --> 05:42.373
Okay, this is new--

05:42.441 --> 05:44.808
getting sick
<i>before</i> lunch.

05:44.876 --> 05:45.977
Oh, hey.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.112
Brad and I are having
a blast with that article.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.914
Thanks for making me
do it.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.618
Sure. Anything to bring you
and Brad closer together.

05:53.685 --> 05:55.720
SALEM:
<i>If that's my novel...</i>

05:55.788 --> 05:59.823
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
The character "Tabrina"
is really a composite.

05:59.891 --> 06:01.292
This is Harvey
and Brad's article.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.194
It took them all of homeroom
to write it,

06:03.261 --> 06:04.829
so you know it's got to be good.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.431
Hey, leave the sarcasm
to the professionals.

06:07.499 --> 06:09.667
You know, I really
should be supportive of Harvey

06:09.735 --> 06:11.602
and give Brad the benefit
of the doubt...

06:11.670 --> 06:13.538
but I bet
this article really bites.

06:14.473 --> 06:15.406
( <i>laughing</i> )

06:15.474 --> 06:16.507
Oh, <i>man...</i>

06:16.574 --> 06:19.477
I haven't read
sportwriting this good

06:19.545 --> 06:22.547
since the glory days
of Jimmy Cannon.

06:22.614 --> 06:23.715
Oh, what would you know?

06:23.782 --> 06:25.016
So the phrases are witty

06:25.083 --> 06:26.751
and the metaphors
are imaginative;

06:26.819 --> 06:28.219
it's still bad writing.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.355
Yeah, Pulitzer bad.

06:30.422 --> 06:32.857
( <i>laughing</i> )

06:32.925 --> 06:34.659
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Bye, monkey.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.260
So, it's settled.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.496
Willard and his
brother are coming

06:38.564 --> 06:40.631
to dinner,
and I'm going to show him

06:40.699 --> 06:43.001
that I'm immune
to Wally's charms.

06:43.068 --> 06:45.102
Too bad you're not immune
to Willard.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.136
My, but you have found

06:46.204 --> 06:47.638
a lot of empty
potion bottles.

06:47.706 --> 06:48.940
Not really.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.508
Suddenly, I remembered
we're witches.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.209
One point
and we've got more empties

06:52.277 --> 06:53.811
than Boris Yeltsin's
trash can.

06:53.879 --> 06:55.112
Hilda...

06:58.116 --> 07:01.786
"Attention-- redeeming
magically reproduced
bottles will result

07:01.854 --> 07:04.255
in a heavy fine and
unreachable itching."

07:04.323 --> 07:05.356
Good.

07:05.423 --> 07:07.825
Does Big Brother
never sleep?

07:07.893 --> 07:08.859
"No."

07:10.061 --> 07:12.163
So, do you want to
join us for dinner?

07:12.231 --> 07:13.163
No, thanks.

07:13.231 --> 07:14.231
I'd rather wade

07:14.299 --> 07:15.333
through ankle-deep dust

07:15.401 --> 07:17.001
and breathe
bacteria-laden spores

07:17.069 --> 07:18.436
than eat with <i>two</i> Krafts.

07:18.503 --> 07:19.770
So, you'll be in the basement?

07:19.838 --> 07:22.740
Until I can afford... Aruba.

07:22.808 --> 07:23.641
Oh, for Pete's sake...

07:23.708 --> 07:25.143
No, if you don't respect
my opinion

07:25.210 --> 07:26.411
that this writing
is garbage,

07:26.478 --> 07:28.479
then maybe you'll believe
some professionals.

07:28.547 --> 07:29.680
Mr. Twain?

07:29.748 --> 07:31.015
Quite amusing.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.250
Oh, stop breathing
steamboat fumes.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.586
This essay's the thing.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.822
Oh, like you really wrote
any of your own plays.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.424
Miss Dickinson?

07:39.525 --> 07:41.258
This shows <i>real</i> talent.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.293
Shut-in.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.131
( <i>bubbling, percolating sound</i> )

07:47.199 --> 07:48.666
Uh-oh...

07:48.733 --> 07:50.501
Sounds like you're making
the sound witches make

07:50.569 --> 07:52.737
when jealousy
is percolating.

07:52.805 --> 07:53.571
I am not jealous.

07:53.638 --> 07:54.872
I mean,
just because Harvey has

07:54.940 --> 07:56.807
a new best friend who he likes
more than me

07:56.875 --> 07:59.110
and his new best friend is
more talented than I am

07:59.178 --> 08:00.711
and my old best friend is
in Alaska

08:00.779 --> 08:01.945
with her new best friend,
big deal!

08:03.749 --> 08:06.484
I thought <i>I</i> was
your best friend.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.120
( <i>percolating</i> )

08:09.188 --> 08:10.621
Sabrina,

08:10.689 --> 08:12.523
are you percolating
with jealousy?

08:12.590 --> 08:13.758
No, I'm...

08:13.826 --> 08:16.227
bubbling over with ideas.

08:16.294 --> 08:17.595
You have to be careful, honey.

08:17.662 --> 08:19.130
You could develop jealotosis,

08:19.198 --> 08:21.466
a condition where jealousy
gets out of control.

08:21.533 --> 08:22.900
That doesn't sound
very good.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.102
You can fight it.

08:24.169 --> 08:26.170
All you have to do is
be very happy

08:26.238 --> 08:28.339
for the person
you're jealous of.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.807
So, you're saying I have
to accept the fact

08:29.875 --> 08:31.042
that Harvey has
a new best friend

08:31.110 --> 08:32.043
and be happy for him.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.644
I can do that--
I can be happy for him.

08:33.712 --> 08:34.511
Well, good.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.847
How happy?

08:37.448 --> 08:40.484
Hey, Sabrina, did
you read our article?

08:40.552 --> 08:43.654
I still have to look at it,
but... I'm happy for you.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.023
If it's too short,
let us know,

08:45.090 --> 08:47.124
'cause while were hanging out
at the arcade,

08:47.192 --> 08:49.226
Brad thought up
a couple more great jokes.

08:49.294 --> 08:51.428
I'm happy for you.

08:53.698 --> 08:55.733
If I sometimes
seem irritable,

08:55.801 --> 08:58.368
it's because I have
inoperable hemorrhoids.

08:58.436 --> 09:00.904
I'm happy for you.

09:00.972 --> 09:02.473
Come on, Harv,
let's go work

09:02.540 --> 09:04.909
on our Government
project together.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.411
( <i>percolating</i> )

09:06.478 --> 09:07.545
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:07.613 --> 09:10.281
I really was happy
for Mr. Kraft.

09:11.483 --> 09:12.049
Sabrina...

09:12.117 --> 09:13.051
Oh, uh...

09:13.118 --> 09:15.053
just wearing the shades
to be cool.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.821
Nothing
to be concerned about.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.422
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

09:18.490 --> 09:21.458
Oh, that must be Willard
and Wally.

09:24.963 --> 09:27.297
No, no, no, no, no, no,
even at my age,

09:27.365 --> 09:30.034
the right pacifier can
be really comforting.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.370
Stop revealing
these things to me.

09:33.438 --> 09:36.040
Oh, dear,
the vulnerability spell.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.909
But in the deepest
depths of my soul, I
still believe that...

09:38.977 --> 09:42.814
that was some football
game on Sunday, huh?

09:42.881 --> 09:45.282
Yeah, well,
here goes.

09:46.684 --> 09:47.918
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:48.020 --> 09:49.020
Zelda, Wally.

09:49.087 --> 09:50.221
Wally, Zelda.

09:50.288 --> 09:51.756
You sold her
short, Willard.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.458
She's <i>more</i> beautiful
than a Monet painting.

09:54.525 --> 09:55.827
Oh, my, my.

09:55.894 --> 10:00.331
You are the <i>second-</i>
most-charming Kraft
I've ever met.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.866
You've met mother.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.034
Oh... you.

10:04.102 --> 10:04.836
And it starts.

10:04.903 --> 10:06.537
HILDA:
Someone has stolen

10:06.604 --> 10:08.405
our potions t...

10:08.507 --> 10:09.473
Oh.

10:09.541 --> 10:10.441
I'm sorry.

10:10.508 --> 10:11.742
I overdressed.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.846
Ah, and who is
this dust storm of enchantment?

10:14.913 --> 10:17.748
Hilda, but you can call me,
"dust storm of enchantment."

10:17.816 --> 10:18.850
( <i>laughing</i> )

10:18.917 --> 10:20.785
Hilda, I'd like you
to meet my brother Wally.

10:20.853 --> 10:21.852
Some other time.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.720
Right now, I'd like to
get to know this cutie.

10:23.788 --> 10:26.156
I think he likes her.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.491
Yes.

10:27.558 --> 10:29.260
I'm happy for them.

10:30.395 --> 10:31.762
( <i>startled gasping</i> )

10:31.830 --> 10:32.630
Oh!

10:32.697 --> 10:34.798
S-Sabrina,
you woke me up.

10:34.866 --> 10:37.835
Whatever happened to <i>quiet</i>
desperation?

10:37.902 --> 10:40.004
I have to find a spell,
but I can't see anything.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.241
Well, remove the shades,
Miss <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

10:46.011 --> 10:46.977
Dear Lord!

10:47.045 --> 10:48.612
You're green with envy.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.447
You have jealotosis.

10:50.515 --> 10:52.583
Jealousy will take over you
and your world.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.118
( <i>crying</i> ):
All is lost!

10:54.185 --> 10:57.087
( <i>regular voice</i> ):
But I wouldn't worry about it.

11:03.895 --> 11:04.828
Here it is.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.096
"the cure to jealotosis.

11:06.164 --> 11:08.198
Jealousy must run
its natural course."

11:08.266 --> 11:10.167
Since when did this book
start taking

11:10.235 --> 11:11.769
a holistic approach
to magic?

11:11.837 --> 11:14.137
Maybe all you need is
a good night's sleep.

11:14.205 --> 11:15.807
Right. And tomorrow I'll wake up

11:15.874 --> 11:17.508
and be happy
for Harvey and Brad.

11:24.816 --> 11:28.753
SALEM:
Behold, the first envy-powered
night light.

11:33.158 --> 11:36.260
( <i>grunts</i> )

11:36.328 --> 11:38.862
Is the glow gone?

11:38.964 --> 11:40.198
You know what?

11:40.265 --> 11:43.334
I am so sick of Harvey
and his friend Brad

11:43.402 --> 11:46.737
always laughing, having fun,
making plans.

11:46.805 --> 11:47.771
On the plus side,

11:47.839 --> 11:50.107
(chuckles)
you look rested.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.676
You know, Dreama's not even
around for me to hang out with.

11:52.744 --> 11:54.177
But you know what?
I'm a witch.

11:54.245 --> 11:55.813
I can have
any best friend I want.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.750
Tara Lipinski!

11:59.785 --> 12:01.018
What's going on?

12:01.085 --> 12:02.786
I was at the rink, and now I...

12:02.888 --> 12:03.754
You're my new best friend!

12:04.990 --> 12:06.957
Come on. Let's get
ready for school.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.527
Now I have no reason
to be jealous of anyone.

12:09.594 --> 12:10.861
SALEM:
Hey, gold medal girl.

12:10.929 --> 12:12.262
Show me a triple lutz.

12:12.331 --> 12:15.766
Hey! She's my friend,
not yours.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.068
Don't you want to ask
about last night?

12:18.136 --> 12:20.938
Didn't you notice how
Wally and I really
hit it off?

12:21.039 --> 12:22.472
No, not really.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.642
You know, when I'm with Willard,
I can't help but shut out

12:25.710 --> 12:26.911
the rest of the world.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.078
Well, the feeling is mutual

12:28.113 --> 12:29.913
on the part
of the rest of the world.

12:29.948 --> 12:30.814
Anyway,

12:30.916 --> 12:32.884
Wally and I have
so much in common.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.086
He loves literature,
art, science.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.321
You have no interest
in those subjects.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.388
I do now.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.092
Wally's going to take me
to the Van Gogh exhibit.

12:41.226 --> 12:42.393
You're kidding!

12:42.461 --> 12:45.362
I've been hinting to Willard
to take me there.

12:45.430 --> 12:49.833
But the <i>Babylon 5</i> convention
should be culturally enriching.

12:49.868 --> 12:51.535
Well, I'm off to school

12:51.603 --> 12:54.772
with my new best friend,
Tara Lipinski.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.274
I can't believe he's taking
you to Van Gogh.

12:57.309 --> 12:58.608
Attention, everyone.

12:58.676 --> 13:01.111
All detention is canceled
because

13:01.179 --> 13:05.048
¶ my brother didn't steal
my gal. ¶

13:06.584 --> 13:08.385
Man, I've never seen Mr. Kraft
so happy.

13:08.453 --> 13:10.621
You weren't here last year
for the public caning.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.589
( <i>laughs</i> )

13:11.656 --> 13:13.057
Oh, yeah, laugh all you want

13:13.125 --> 13:15.392
but I've got
a new best friend now, too.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.527
Tara Lipinski!

13:16.595 --> 13:17.694
I'm in love!

13:17.763 --> 13:21.465
(all clamoring)

13:21.533 --> 13:24.568
Wow, it's great
having a best friend.

13:24.635 --> 13:25.869
There's so many
places we can go

13:25.937 --> 13:27.505
where I can stand
off to the side

13:27.572 --> 13:29.640
while everyone else pays
attention to her

13:29.708 --> 13:31.709
and she doesn't even notice
I'm alive!

13:37.415 --> 13:39.717
Wally and I just had
the most divine lunch

13:39.785 --> 13:41.185
at Chez Maurice.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.420
You and Willard have probably
never have been there,

13:43.488 --> 13:45.155
because there's
no drive-through.

13:45.223 --> 13:47.024
Willard and I had
a very nice lunch today.

13:47.092 --> 13:49.259
Food at Custer's has improved.

13:49.327 --> 13:51.829
I didn't even chip a tooth
this time.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.131
Did I show you the flowers
Wally brought me?

13:54.199 --> 13:55.933
Willard and I have
a relationship

13:56.001 --> 13:57.734
that's so strong,
he doesn't need

13:57.802 --> 13:58.936
to give me presents.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.003
Oh, really?

14:00.071 --> 14:02.206
Oh, what's this then?

14:02.274 --> 14:07.110
"Zelda, keep this handy for
the next monster truck show."

14:07.178 --> 14:08.912
Give me that.

14:08.980 --> 14:11.581
Sabrina, even though
I'm in the middle

14:11.649 --> 14:13.050
of a psychotic episode

14:13.118 --> 14:16.053
I liked your friends,
especially Brad.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.254
Oh, yeah. Everyone likes Brad.

14:17.321 --> 14:19.289
Everyone likes you--
well, you know what?

14:19.357 --> 14:22.092
You can just find yourself
a new best friend.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.163
Sabrina, would you remove
your dark glasses, dear?

14:26.231 --> 14:28.365
Oh, I would, but it's like
a tanning salon in here.

14:28.433 --> 14:29.433
Sabrina.

14:33.271 --> 14:35.705
Oh, no, you've got
full-blown jealotosis.

14:35.773 --> 14:37.507
Or a lousy brand of contacts.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.443
I know. That's why I'm going
to go hide away in your room.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.979
My room?
Yeah. It's a lot better
than my little dinky one.

14:42.046 --> 14:43.346
Oh, wow, this is
a bad case

14:43.414 --> 14:44.982
if she's
envying your decor.

14:45.049 --> 14:46.717
Sabrina, you
can't hide away.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.084
Jealotosis can't
run it's course

14:48.152 --> 14:50.454
unless you're out in public
encountering people

14:50.521 --> 14:52.055
who have things you want.

14:52.123 --> 14:54.057
Wow, you know so much.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.892
I envy that stuff!

14:55.960 --> 14:56.994
Honey, when you're older

14:57.062 --> 14:59.229
it'll be easier to
control your jealousy.

14:59.297 --> 15:01.532
Oh, like the way you're
controlling your jealousy

15:01.600 --> 15:03.133
over my relationship with Wally?

15:03.201 --> 15:06.269
I'm afraid your confusing
jealousy with pity.

15:06.337 --> 15:08.072
Why don't I have someone
to argue with?

15:08.139 --> 15:09.406
Sabrina, go back
to school and envy

15:09.474 --> 15:11.442
someone your own age.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.178
Cool outfit.
See? That was good.

15:15.246 --> 15:16.747
I wasn't jealous at all.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.349
I got an "A"!
I got an "A"!

15:19.417 --> 15:21.585
Hey, why should you get
an "A" and not me?

15:21.653 --> 15:22.619
Uh, you're
not in the class.

15:22.687 --> 15:23.654
Right.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.656
I didn't even want
to be in that class

15:25.724 --> 15:27.457
and I'm not jealous
of you a bit.

15:27.526 --> 15:28.559
Not a bit!

15:28.627 --> 15:29.960
Hi, Sabrina.

15:30.027 --> 15:31.429
You seem happy.
I don't want
to be happy.

15:31.496 --> 15:33.264
That's not something
I crave at all.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.398
Hey, did you read
the article yet?

15:34.466 --> 15:35.866
Yeah, but I'm not
publishing it.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.401
Ha! There.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.669
Now you're not so
happy any more are
you, Señor Happy?

15:39.737 --> 15:40.871
Now you got nothing I want.

15:42.874 --> 15:44.007
Hey, Sabrina.

15:44.075 --> 15:45.342
Oh, don't try to act
all innocent with me.

15:45.410 --> 15:46.777
I saw you cozying up
to the lunch lady.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.278
What does if for you?
Her support hose?

15:48.346 --> 15:50.614
(chuckles)
Are you okay?

15:50.682 --> 15:51.582
Why wouldn't I be okay?

15:51.650 --> 15:52.983
I'm a better writer
than Brad

15:53.051 --> 15:54.551
and I look better in a hairnet
than Mrs. Hornbuckle.

15:56.054 --> 15:58.255
What's the matter, jealous?

15:58.323 --> 15:59.924
I don't care if you
have a secret.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.024
I don't like secrets.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.259
What's the secret?!

16:02.327 --> 16:03.227
I'm really glad

16:03.294 --> 16:04.428
that you and Hilda
have hit it off

16:04.496 --> 16:06.196
because she never cared
much for me.

16:06.264 --> 16:08.799
That's what's so
great about my
relationship with her.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.267
We seem to agree
on everything.

16:10.335 --> 16:11.235
Oh, now, come on.

16:11.302 --> 16:12.770
( <i>both chuckle</i> )

16:12.837 --> 16:14.805
Why should Mr. Kraft have
a best friend and not me?

16:14.873 --> 16:16.640
Why should he get to be happy
and not me?

16:16.775 --> 16:17.808
Why does he...?

16:17.876 --> 16:21.512
Oh, no. I'm jealous
of Mr. Kraft!

16:23.481 --> 16:24.682
(liquid sloshing)

16:24.750 --> 16:27.417
Salem, where am I?

16:27.485 --> 16:29.253
Congratulations,
Sabrina.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.822
You're in the Jealous Sea.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.223
The Jealous Sea?

16:33.291 --> 16:34.625
Hey, I didn't come up
with the name.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.226
I just work here,
so get off my back.

16:36.294 --> 16:37.461
Well, what is this place?

16:37.528 --> 16:39.229
It's your kind of place.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.265
A place where you have
everything

16:41.333 --> 16:43.367
and everyone else
has nothing.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.938
My classmates,
what happened to them?

16:48.006 --> 16:48.873
Good news.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.707
They all had to drop out
of school.

16:50.775 --> 16:52.676
Now they've entered
the exciting field

16:52.743 --> 16:53.844
of menial labor.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.214
Now you'll be the only one
to get good grades.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.882
That's not good news.
I didn't...

16:58.950 --> 17:00.084
Hey, you missed a spot!

17:00.152 --> 17:02.319
What am I saying?

17:02.387 --> 17:04.887
So cold. No clothes,
no job, no food,

17:04.955 --> 17:07.023
and this barrel's a rental.

17:07.090 --> 17:08.058
Mr. Kraft...

17:08.125 --> 17:10.393
Can't we do
something for him?

17:10.461 --> 17:12.796
Not mention that
the barrel makes
him look heavy?

17:13.732 --> 17:15.131
Anyway, you can't be happy

17:15.199 --> 17:17.067
as long as he's happy, right?

17:17.102 --> 17:18.301
But...

17:20.305 --> 17:20.837
Harvey.

17:20.972 --> 17:22.705
Sabrina, I don't have

17:22.772 --> 17:24.241
a best friend anymore.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.976
So quit your bellyaching!

17:26.044 --> 17:27.544
You still have Sabrina.

17:27.612 --> 17:31.114
Yeah, but it was kind of nice
having a best friend, too.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.582
I'm going to miss him.

17:32.650 --> 17:33.884
I know.

17:33.951 --> 17:35.619
That's exactly how I felt
when Valerie moved away.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.354
I don't want you
to go through that, too.

17:37.421 --> 17:39.089
Salem, do something.

17:39.157 --> 17:40.558
This is what you wanted.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.058
I didn't want this.

17:42.126 --> 17:44.461
Why couldn't I have just been
happy for Harvey?

17:44.529 --> 17:46.597
Yeah. And why can't I find
better work

17:46.665 --> 17:49.866
than being a know-it-all
in a subconscious daydream?

17:52.570 --> 17:54.104
Dream?

17:54.172 --> 17:55.205
Sabrina?

17:55.273 --> 17:57.474
Sabrina, are
you okay?

17:57.542 --> 17:58.475
If everyone else
has what they want

17:58.543 --> 17:59.643
it doesn't diminish what I have.

17:59.711 --> 18:00.978
Absolutely.

18:01.045 --> 18:01.979
When she fainted,
did she hit her head?

18:02.047 --> 18:03.080
I don't know.

18:03.147 --> 18:04.047
No, really, think about it.

18:04.115 --> 18:05.282
If everyone else has great stuff

18:05.350 --> 18:06.250
it doesn't take away

18:06.318 --> 18:08.018
all the wonderful things
that I have.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.553
I'm happy to hear
you say that.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.921
Let's go to the nurse.

18:10.988 --> 18:11.921
No, no. I'm fine.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.424
Can I have
everyone's attention?

18:14.492 --> 18:17.294
I just want to apologize
for the way I've been behaving

18:17.362 --> 18:18.662
and I want you all
to get good grades

18:18.730 --> 18:19.863
and not become janitors

18:19.931 --> 18:22.065
unless the custodial work
is your passion.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.567
Oh, Brad, I'm going
to publish the article

18:23.602 --> 18:24.635
that you and
Harvey wrote.

18:24.702 --> 18:25.736
It's excellent.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.170
Then why did you
reject it before?

18:27.238 --> 18:28.372
Well, you know,
running a newspaper

18:28.473 --> 18:29.540
is a very complicated business

18:29.608 --> 18:30.874
but mainly,
I was just being a jerk.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.709
Okay, I got to go apologize
to Mr. Kraft now.

18:32.777 --> 18:33.911
(chuckling):
Okay, that's it.

18:33.978 --> 18:36.146
You're going to the nurse.

18:36.213 --> 18:37.747
I just heard
from the Other Realm.

18:37.815 --> 18:39.616
Sabrina's back
from the Jealous Sea

18:39.684 --> 18:41.451
and her jealotosis is gone.

18:41.519 --> 18:42.653
Oh, good.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.255
Do you remember when
we were teenagers

18:44.322 --> 18:46.357
and the Jealous Sea
had the best Club Med?

18:46.424 --> 18:47.391
Yeah.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.758
It's also made me remember

18:48.826 --> 18:50.761
that a person can be
happy for others

18:50.828 --> 18:52.729
without diminishing
what she has.

18:52.797 --> 18:54.097
Uh-huh.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.066
And I just want to say
that I've been acting jealous,

18:57.134 --> 18:58.369
and I'm sorry.

18:58.436 --> 19:00.604
I want you and Wally to have
a great time tonight.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.572
Thanks, Zellie.

19:01.639 --> 19:03.273
I'm sure we'll enjoy the ballet.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.042
I mean, handsome men in tights--
how bad can it be?

19:06.110 --> 19:06.977
The ballet?

19:07.646 --> 19:08.779
I mentioned that

19:08.847 --> 19:11.949
to Willard months ago,
and I get nothing!

19:20.992 --> 19:23.927
I'm glad I didn't
tell you we have
orchestra seats.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.963
Oh, let me guess.

19:27.031 --> 19:30.134
This is the way mature
witches handle their jealousy?

19:30.201 --> 19:32.402
I can't believe
I blew like that.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.436
What is your problem?

19:33.504 --> 19:34.771
Do you want
to date Wally?

19:34.839 --> 19:37.274
No. I'm not jealous
because he likes you.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.510
I'm jealous because Wally takes
you to all the places

19:40.578 --> 19:42.245
I want Willard to take me.

19:42.313 --> 19:44.047
You know, I may be a younger,
less mature witch,

19:44.114 --> 19:45.182
but it seems to me

19:45.249 --> 19:46.816
that if you want Mr. Kraft
to take you places

19:46.884 --> 19:48.285
instead of waiting for him
to ask you,

19:48.386 --> 19:49.419
why don't you ask him?

19:49.487 --> 19:51.155
You're right.

19:51.222 --> 19:52.956
I'm going to.

19:53.058 --> 19:56.360
I'm going to ask Willard Kraft
to the ballet.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.766
( <i>snoring</i> )

20:06.972 --> 20:08.238
Hey.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.741
Oh, hi, Harvey.

20:10.808 --> 20:13.644
Hey, I understand
the article you and Brad wrote

20:13.678 --> 20:14.711
was a big hit.

20:14.779 --> 20:15.645
People seem to like it.

20:15.713 --> 20:17.113
Like it?

20:17.181 --> 20:19.182
You should have seen he
and Brad walk into math class.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.217
It was like Lillian Hellman
walking into Sardi's

20:21.286 --> 20:22.352
after <i>The Little Foxes.</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:24.153
So you ready
to start the next one?

20:24.189 --> 20:26.122
Yeah. Let's go get Brad
and start brainstorming.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.257
You know what?

20:27.292 --> 20:28.391
Do you think just the two of us

20:28.459 --> 20:29.592
could work on this one?

20:29.661 --> 20:30.327
Really?

20:30.394 --> 20:31.161
Yeah. I don't know

20:31.229 --> 20:32.196
if you're aware of it

20:32.263 --> 20:33.696
but Brad and I have
been spending

20:33.764 --> 20:35.265
a lot of time
together lately.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.734
Really? I hadn't noticed.

20:45.009 --> 20:46.777
So how was your
date with Harvey?

20:46.844 --> 20:48.045
Oh, it was great.
We went to the Slicery.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.112
All of our friends
were there.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.046
Most of them
at our table

20:50.114 --> 20:51.214
so we're going
to ease into

20:51.282 --> 20:52.916
the whole "spending
time alone" thing.

20:52.984 --> 20:54.184
How was your date
with Wally?

20:54.252 --> 20:55.619
Well, he's not
really my type.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.621
We didn't have
that much in common

20:57.689 --> 20:59.489
and I really don't
like his cologne.

20:59.557 --> 21:00.357
So you going
out again?

21:00.424 --> 21:01.257
Tuesday.

21:01.325 --> 21:02.726
I just finished
an experiment.

21:02.794 --> 21:04.961
Thought I'd save you
the potion bottle.

21:05.029 --> 21:06.296
Oh, thanks.

21:07.532 --> 21:08.565
Hey, I thought you
were going to cash

21:08.700 --> 21:10.000
those in for a trip
to the islands?

21:10.068 --> 21:11.968
I was. And then
I remembered

21:12.036 --> 21:13.002
I'm a witch.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.439
I'll be back
when I get a tan.
