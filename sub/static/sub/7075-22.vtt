WEBVTT

00:00.175 --> 00:02.839
And that's how paleolithic hunting tribes

00:02.959 --> 00:05.218
overtook early agricultural
civilizations.

00:05.285 --> 00:07.954
Ah. That's an interesting
answer, miss Edison.

00:08.021 --> 00:10.623
- Is it right?
- Don't know. Don't care.

00:10.691 --> 00:12.208
But so far,
you're all getting As.

00:14.561 --> 00:15.595
You're welcome.

00:15.662 --> 00:16.996
Are you sure everyone should
get as?

00:17.064 --> 00:18.364
It seems a little unfair
to the people

00:18.432 --> 00:19.699
that actually studied.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.717
Throw paper balls at her head
until she sits down.

00:21.785 --> 00:24.904
Oh! What? Oh.

00:24.955 --> 00:27.707
- Sitting. I'm sitting.
- Good. Very good.

00:27.774 --> 00:29.842
A-pluses for all of you.

00:31.812 --> 00:34.297
Professor Duncan,
you are such a great teacher

00:34.381 --> 00:35.431
when you're drinking.

00:35.499 --> 00:37.333
- Thank you, Darrell.
- It's Troy.

00:37.417 --> 00:39.752
Hey, the man wants
to give Darrell an "A,"

00:39.820 --> 00:41.087
let him do it.

00:41.155 --> 00:45.091
- Nice shot.
- Oh, thanks.

00:45.142 --> 00:50.012
A toast to the easiest school,
the dumbest dean...

00:50.097 --> 00:52.482
And the ultimate
blow off class.

00:52.566 --> 00:54.984
Anthropology.
Who knew?

00:57.771 --> 00:58.971
- Hey, Shirley.
- Hmm?

00:59.039 --> 01:00.039
You're not drinking.

01:00.107 --> 01:02.008
Someone is cruising
for an A-minus.

01:02.075 --> 01:03.976
Oh, no, no, I'm with child.

01:04.044 --> 01:05.027
Well, if it's my child,

01:05.111 --> 01:06.712
it's okay
to have a drink or two.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.415
Chang babies love the sauce,
you know?

01:09.483 --> 01:13.152
Alcohol and duck.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.122
Zoink.

01:16.190 --> 01:18.257
This is not your child, Chang.

01:18.325 --> 01:20.159
- It's Andre's.
- How do you know?

01:20.227 --> 01:21.928
Because I don't see
any locusts.

01:21.995 --> 01:24.297
Besides,
a woman knows these things.

01:24.364 --> 01:25.998
Women have a connectedness
to their bodies

01:26.066 --> 01:27.700
that you would never
understand.

01:27.768 --> 01:30.052
You have a booger.

01:30.137 --> 01:32.004
I know.
It's part of me.

01:32.072 --> 01:33.806
Hey. Can we please do
the exam?

01:33.874 --> 01:35.808
Question number two:

01:35.859 --> 01:38.060
How awesome is it
that this class is fake?

01:40.247 --> 01:42.732
Here is to never telling
the dean.

01:49.823 --> 01:53.042
And <i>that</i> is what Jews do
at weddings.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.928
- Anthropology!
- <i>L'Chaim!</i>

01:55.996 --> 01:59.832
♪ Give me some rope
time in a dream ♪

01:59.883 --> 02:03.135

02:22.623 --> 02:25.524
Oh, professor Duncan, class,

02:25.576 --> 02:26.859
this is Mr. Jacobson.

02:26.927 --> 02:29.595
He's a writer who's doing
a piece on me

02:29.663 --> 02:31.297
for <i>Dean Magazine.</i>

02:31.365 --> 02:34.400
- Ah!
- I know, right?

02:34.468 --> 02:35.567
Well, keep taking your exam.

02:35.619 --> 02:37.736
Don't let my presence
distract you.

02:37.788 --> 02:40.206
I'm sort of a father figure
to the kids around here

02:40.257 --> 02:43.709
for my "outside the box"
approach to education.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.912
You know, like that film
<i>Children of the Corn.</i>

02:46.980 --> 02:49.982
- Oh, professor.
- What?

02:50.050 --> 02:53.919
- Proceed.
- Yes.

02:53.987 --> 02:57.757
The Anthropology final.

02:57.824 --> 03:01.994
Do you know what, I have left
the exam paper in my office.

03:02.062 --> 03:03.980
But it is a real doozy.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.699
There is an interactive element.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.534
A performance component.

03:08.601 --> 03:10.102
And I don't want to tip it,

03:10.170 --> 03:14.440
but there may be a lump of clay
coming to everyone in the room.

03:14.508 --> 03:17.660
So, uh, toodle-oo.
Cheerio.

03:17.744 --> 03:21.414
Wowee.
This is a real college.

03:21.481 --> 03:23.182
So after this,

03:23.250 --> 03:25.418
we should check out
the world food festival

03:25.485 --> 03:26.585
in the parking lot.

03:26.653 --> 03:28.421
No way.

03:28.488 --> 03:31.290
There are lunch trucks
with 18 different nationalities

03:31.341 --> 03:32.642
of food.

03:32.726 --> 03:35.261
You know what, not different.
Equal. Equal to whites.

03:35.312 --> 03:37.830
You know what,
better than whites.

03:37.898 --> 03:39.131
Oh, I think that sounds

03:39.199 --> 03:41.801
like an awesome thing to do
immediately.

03:41.868 --> 03:46.639
I bet the reader
<i>Dean Magazine</i> would love it.

03:46.707 --> 03:47.973
I'm good.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.241
I'd like to stay here
and check out

03:49.309 --> 03:50.526
this unorthodox exam.

03:53.213 --> 03:54.497
- Shirley, you okay?
- Uh-huh.

03:54.581 --> 03:56.182
Just a little indigestion.

03:56.249 --> 03:58.017
I've been having it
all morning.

03:58.085 --> 03:59.352
Are you sure
it isn't contractions?

03:59.419 --> 04:02.021
No, no, no. It's way too early
for any of that.

04:02.089 --> 04:04.156
Um, my other two
came right on schedule.

04:04.207 --> 04:05.791
Maybe even a little late.

04:05.859 --> 04:06.892
Jordan was in here so long,

04:06.960 --> 04:08.494
he came out
with a driver's license.

04:08.545 --> 04:12.665
I'm kidding.
That's not true. Ooh.

04:12.733 --> 04:14.183
Chang babies
are always premature.

04:14.267 --> 04:16.851
We gestate fast because we're
better at obtaining nutrients.

04:16.937 --> 04:18.170
Some need only eight months,

04:18.238 --> 04:21.974
depending on how much
of the mother they eat.

04:22.041 --> 04:27.029
Oh, uh, Shirley,
that is full of chemicals.

04:27.114 --> 04:28.864
I wouldn't expose your baby
to that.

04:28.949 --> 04:31.217
Actually, my doctor said
antacid is safe to take.

04:31.284 --> 04:33.119
Yeah, let me guess
who paid for that study.

04:33.186 --> 04:34.620
Big antacid.

04:34.688 --> 04:36.756
Shirley,
chew on a eucalyptus root

04:36.823 --> 04:39.742
and--I know it sounds gross--
pig saliva.

04:39.826 --> 04:42.294
It's the same active
ingredient as antacid.

04:42.362 --> 04:44.046
They just dress it up
with a fancy name.

04:44.131 --> 04:45.264
How dare they.

04:45.332 --> 04:46.565
Hey, you want to see
a movie today?

04:46.633 --> 04:47.883
- Word.
- Cool.

04:47.968 --> 04:52.338
- Hey, guys, why do you do that?
- Do what?

04:53.974 --> 04:56.375
- It's cool.
- How?

04:56.443 --> 04:58.377
I don't know.
It just is.

04:58.445 --> 05:01.514
Well, let me in.
Let me in to the handshake.

05:01.565 --> 05:03.349
Give you $1,000.

05:05.919 --> 05:08.354
<i>Indecent Proposal.</i>
<i>Indecent Proposal.</i>

05:08.422 --> 05:09.855
- Woody.
- Demi.

05:09.923 --> 05:13.259
Nice.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:24.104 --> 05:26.872
You two gonna fall in love?

05:26.923 --> 05:28.073
No.

05:28.141 --> 05:30.476
I don't know.

05:34.247 --> 05:36.782
So have you considered
natural childbirth?

05:36.850 --> 05:38.984
Are you kidding me?
I'll take whatever they got.

05:39.052 --> 05:40.986
An epidural is a proper
Christian woman's only chance

05:41.054 --> 05:42.054
to get wrecked.

05:42.122 --> 05:43.222
Yeah, but from what I'm told,

05:43.290 --> 05:44.990
the real high
is the endorphin rush

05:45.058 --> 05:46.425
of a chemical-free birth.

05:46.493 --> 05:47.926
I read an article that said

05:47.978 --> 05:49.895
some women
can actually achieve or--

05:49.946 --> 05:52.531
Uh-uh, no, no, no.
Thank you for the conversation.

05:52.599 --> 05:53.783
I know
what you're talking about.

05:53.867 --> 05:54.900
And even if it were true,

05:54.968 --> 05:56.135
that's not something
a woman does

05:56.203 --> 05:57.119
on her child's head.

05:57.204 --> 05:58.337
- But--
- Mmm!

05:58.405 --> 05:59.338
Listen, backseat birther,

05:59.406 --> 06:01.240
Shirley's on her third kid.

06:01.308 --> 06:02.775
She doesn't need
a third-year-old slacker

06:02.843 --> 06:04.777
with two one-eyed cats
governing her body.

06:04.845 --> 06:07.746
First of all, together,
my cats can do anything.

06:07.798 --> 06:10.149
Secondly, you disqualified
yourself from this conversation

06:10.217 --> 06:12.117
the moment you decided
to grow a wang.

06:12.169 --> 06:13.252
I regret nothing.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.553
I feel sorry for the airhead

06:14.621 --> 06:16.422
that you're gonna knock up
at the age of 70.

06:16.490 --> 06:17.890
You're gonna be sitting
in the waiting room

06:17.957 --> 06:19.191
playing Solitaire
on your BlackBerry

06:19.259 --> 06:21.827
while a life is created
ten feet from you.

06:21.895 --> 06:24.830
Oh, and you're gonna squat
in a babbling brook

06:24.898 --> 06:27.633
and a beautiful star child
is going to slide out

06:27.701 --> 06:29.835
on a ray of sunshine
while your cats each half watch

06:29.903 --> 06:31.270
because you're <i>so</i> natural.

06:34.174 --> 06:35.941
Oh-oh. Okay. Oh, boy.

06:35.992 --> 06:39.211
Can someone please get
every mop on campus?

06:39.279 --> 06:42.348
Um, did you break water?
Is that broken water?

06:42.415 --> 06:44.783
- That's broken water!
- Chang baby!

06:46.893 --> 06:49.142
Just nice and easy, careful...

06:49.262 --> 06:51.643
Oh, father, God almighty,
this isn't happening.

06:51.727 --> 06:52.811
It's too soon.

06:52.895 --> 06:54.262
I don't want
my baby's first memory

06:54.313 --> 06:57.499
- to be star-burns.
- Oh, goodness. All right.

06:57.567 --> 07:00.468
This is not a big deal. Wait.
I mean, it is a big deal.

07:00.536 --> 07:03.104
It's just not a big bad deal.
It's a big good deal.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.506
If I could have everyone's
attention--

07:04.574 --> 07:06.641
Actually would like not
to have your attention.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.293
Okay, give me your attention.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.046
This student is having a baby.
What am I talking about?

07:11.113 --> 07:12.314
You already know.

07:12.381 --> 07:13.765
Okay, here's--
Okay, here's what it is.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.949
I'm gonna go get my Prius,

07:15.001 --> 07:16.518
I'm gonna pull around the back,

07:16.586 --> 07:18.119
and I'm gonna drive her
to the hospital.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.788
I drive a Prius,
which I think is pretty cool.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.291
- Dean, go!
- Okay, dean gone.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.593
Can you please call Andre?

07:24.644 --> 07:26.461
He's "Sugar Boots" in my phone.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.929
That hurts, Shirley.

07:27.997 --> 07:31.333
Oh, oh, I'll get it
because I am here for you.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.134
We came so close
to having one class

07:33.202 --> 07:34.636
that wasn't all about them.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.371
Remember when they all took
that fishing trip

07:36.439 --> 07:37.572
on St. Patrick's Day?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.973
God, that was a good week.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.109
This has got
to be a Chang baby.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.711
Changs are never born
in hospitals.

07:42.778 --> 07:45.780
More like taxicabs,
hardware stores,

07:45.831 --> 07:47.115
bank lines, sewers.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.084
My nephew Jin
was born on a treadmill

07:49.151 --> 07:50.785
at bally total fitness.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.370
20% incline.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.856
"Sugar Boots" says that he'll
meet us at the hospital.

07:54.924 --> 07:58.009
Good. Now can somebody
do something about him?

07:58.094 --> 07:59.827
I'm just saying nobody needs
to freak out.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.731
A Chang is hearty to the core.
We always come out healthy.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.182
That's why there's like
a billion of us.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.134
You ever tried googling me?
Can't be done!

08:06.185 --> 08:08.570
Ben, you have to stop
freaking her out.

08:08.638 --> 08:09.771
Hey, show me some respect.

08:09.839 --> 08:12.540
I might be that child's
estranged father.

08:12.608 --> 08:15.527
- Well, what's it gonna be?
- What?

08:15.611 --> 08:17.212
I want to buy the rights
to your handshake.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.713
Do we have a deal?

08:18.781 --> 08:20.682
Pierce, we're about to take
Shirley to the hospital.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.033
This is not the time.

08:22.118 --> 08:23.351
Oh, it's the time.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.571
According to my watch,
it's 1,000 o'clock.

08:26.656 --> 08:28.156
- Deal.
- Deal.

08:28.224 --> 08:30.659
Great.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.993
- So how does it work?
- I don't know.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.094
We just kind of do it

08:33.162 --> 08:34.746
when one of us
says something awesome.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.999
- Yeah.
- All right. Betty Grable.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.921
I said Betty Grable.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.051
- No.
- Yes.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.055
- No.
- Do it.

09:01.107 --> 09:05.694
Make your money, whore.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.417
Who's Betty Grable?

09:12.501 --> 09:13.868
Yeah, that's the stuff.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.740
Try to take deep breaths
and relax.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.742
- Where is the dean?
- Oh, my God!

09:20.793 --> 09:22.477
- Okay.
- Everything's wet!

09:22.545 --> 09:24.629
- Eew!
- Oh. Oh, that's okay.

09:24.714 --> 09:26.298
That's okay
because it is natural.

09:26.382 --> 09:29.050
It's natural.

09:29.118 --> 09:30.251
Are you uncomfortable, Britta?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.287
- You wish.
- Oh!

09:32.355 --> 09:35.457
- Oh. Okay. Ooh.
- $400. $500.

09:35.524 --> 09:37.609
It's like a million bucks
in dog dollars.

09:37.693 --> 09:41.596
Word.

09:41.647 --> 09:46.117
- What happened?
- Something's off.

09:46.202 --> 09:49.471
It's like buying candy
from a baby.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.206
What did you do?
You ruined it!

09:51.273 --> 09:52.624
Troy, give him back the money.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.293
No, no, no.
Money doesn't matter anymore.

09:55.378 --> 09:58.163
Once you've sold something out,
you can't get it back.

09:58.247 --> 09:59.581
But you didn't even like
our handshake!

09:59.632 --> 10:01.483
I hated it.
Now it's gone.

10:01.550 --> 10:05.687
You two are dumber
than Jackie Coogan.

10:05.755 --> 10:09.691
He divorced Betty Grable.

10:09.759 --> 10:11.426
Oh oh oh.

10:11.494 --> 10:13.345
Jeff, Pierce tainted
our special handshake

10:13.429 --> 10:14.496
with his blood money

10:14.563 --> 10:15.847
and now we can't get
the magic back!

10:15.931 --> 10:17.849
Holy crap.
You two for real?

10:17.933 --> 10:19.100
Yeah.

10:19.168 --> 10:20.852
Nobody cares
about your stupid handshake.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.470
A baby is coming out
of Shirley's vagina

10:22.521 --> 10:23.971
- two feet from us.
- Don't worry.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.707
Her contractions are still
six minutes apart.

10:25.775 --> 10:27.842
So unless her cervix is dilated
more than eight centimeters,

10:27.910 --> 10:31.946
we still have time
to get her to a hospital.

10:32.014 --> 10:33.248
I delivered a baby
earlier this year

10:33.315 --> 10:34.249
in the back of an SUV.

10:34.316 --> 10:35.350
- What?
- Hmm-hmm.

10:35.418 --> 10:36.451
Where was I when that happened?

10:36.519 --> 10:39.537
I don't know.
Off in the background.

10:39.622 --> 10:41.823
- Did you pull your car up?
- Uh, <i>no.</i>

10:41.891 --> 10:44.175
- It's been overturned!
- What?

10:44.260 --> 10:47.045
Okay, look, I don't want
to alarm anyone,

10:47.113 --> 10:50.331
but the world food festival
has taken a dark turn.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.734
I guess some national
ethnicities

10:52.802 --> 10:54.185
don't play nice with others

10:54.270 --> 10:58.022
and things have turned
into a bit of a race...

10:58.107 --> 11:00.175
- Kerfuffle.
- You mean riot?

11:00.242 --> 11:04.362
Uh, let's use kerfuffle
for now, okay, Mr. Winger?

11:04.447 --> 11:08.516
I was just trying
to feed hungry foodies.

11:08.567 --> 11:09.901
I'm going to call an ambulance.

11:09.985 --> 11:11.403
Oh, there's ambulances
out there!

11:11.487 --> 11:13.221
They're overturning those too!

11:13.289 --> 11:16.241
I mean, I didn't even know
there was a difference

11:16.325 --> 11:18.576
between North
and South Korean barbeque.

11:18.661 --> 11:21.096
I mean, <i>M*A*S*H</i> lasted longer
than that war.

11:21.163 --> 11:24.099
Get over it. Am I right?
Don't print that.

11:24.166 --> 11:27.368
Let's just quit jotting.
Stop writing!

11:27.436 --> 11:29.370
Okay, 911 says it's gonna take
over an hour

11:29.438 --> 11:31.072
because of a race kerfuffle.

11:31.140 --> 11:34.259
Oh.
Lake Woebegone. Eeh!

11:34.343 --> 11:36.177
Abed, what do we do?

11:36.245 --> 11:37.545
Shirley,
pretend I'm saying this

11:37.596 --> 11:40.014
in a soothing, reassuring,
non-robotic voice.

11:40.065 --> 11:41.516
We're not going to make it
to the hospital.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.750
Yes, I am.

11:42.818 --> 11:44.152
I'm going to have this baby
in a hospital

11:44.220 --> 11:45.553
with my husband and the father
of my baby.

11:45.604 --> 11:46.654
Unless that father is me.

11:46.722 --> 11:48.723
In which case,
what you need to do now

11:48.774 --> 11:50.158
is elevate your legs
over your head

11:50.225 --> 11:53.060
while facing the northeast
corner of the room.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.913
But try not to look
at the door, okay?

11:54.997 --> 11:57.198
That's bad luck and Chang babies
are very superstitious.

11:57.249 --> 12:01.202
Also if you can visualize
a rabbit riding a dragon,

12:01.270 --> 12:03.271
it'll increase his chances
of winning lotteries.

12:03.339 --> 12:05.907
Ben, corner.

12:05.958 --> 12:10.178
Listen, Shirley, we're having
the baby right here, right now.

12:10.245 --> 12:12.680
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:12.748 --> 12:14.415
Troy, get every blanket
and coat you can find.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.750
Anything soft for Shirley
to lie on.

12:15.801 --> 12:16.851
Annie, I need you to call Andre

12:16.919 --> 12:18.252
and tell him
to meet us here instead.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.255
- Well, what can I do?
- Stop rubbing her shoulders.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.142
- What are you doing?
- Being natural.

12:24.226 --> 12:26.093
Jeff, help me move Shirley
to the ground.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.196
All right,
just stand right here.

12:28.263 --> 12:31.466
Easy. Easy.
Troy, blankets. There we go.

12:31.534 --> 12:32.650
Okay.

12:32.735 --> 12:33.902
I just need to take a look

12:33.953 --> 12:35.737
and see how far along you are.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.405
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Abed.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.407
I don't feel comfortable
with you taking a grand tour

12:39.475 --> 12:40.441
of my nethers.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.843
I'd prefer
it was one of the girls.

12:41.911 --> 12:43.745
I can do it! I can do it!
I'm good at looking!

12:43.812 --> 12:46.748
I'm here for you, Shirley.
Okay, what do I do?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.633
Okay, you just need to look
and see if the baby's head

12:48.717 --> 12:52.554
- has reached the cervix.
- No problowe, Rob Lowe.

12:55.624 --> 13:01.963
♪ ♪

13:09.305 --> 13:11.206
I take it the head has reached

13:13.609 --> 13:17.095
Oh, God, okay, oh God, alright.

13:17.215 --> 13:19.517
Not to worry. This kind of thing
happens all the time.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.552
Are a lot of babies born
in classrooms?

13:21.620 --> 13:23.253
Well, a lot more are conceived.

13:24.789 --> 13:27.725
No, Paul, that's off the record
and not true. Sort of.

13:27.792 --> 13:28.959
- Annie.
- Got to go.

13:29.027 --> 13:30.561
Hey, okay,
due to an unforeseen conflict

13:30.629 --> 13:31.896
of genitals,
I've been disqualified

13:31.963 --> 13:33.130
from delivering Shirley's baby

13:33.198 --> 13:34.532
so I'm gonna have to walk you
through it.

13:34.599 --> 13:35.833
I can't deliver a baby.

13:35.901 --> 13:37.001
I'm not properly prepared.

13:37.068 --> 13:38.502
I need to take a class,
or read a book,

13:38.570 --> 13:40.504
or shadow a nurse, or at least
have my mom hug me first.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.840
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm seeing spots.

13:42.908 --> 13:44.608
Oh, my lord, my lord,

13:44.659 --> 13:46.377
why are you doing
these things to me?

13:46.444 --> 13:47.711
How have I failed you?

13:47.779 --> 13:49.580
Either way, someone's got
to calm her down.

13:49.631 --> 13:52.850
I got this.
Shirley, look at me.

13:52.918 --> 13:55.285
Look at my face.

13:55.337 --> 14:00.190
Connect with me.

- Chang! Where's Chang?
- What's up, baby?

14:06.848 --> 14:09.299
You said Chang babies
all come this way?

14:09.351 --> 14:10.834
Yeah, like a bullet from a gun.

14:10.902 --> 14:13.237

- Hell, yeah.

14:13.304 --> 14:15.406

Super babies.

Seven generations
of little scrappers

14:17.542 --> 14:19.743
born in the worst conditions
you can imagine.

14:19.811 --> 14:21.078
Tell me.

14:21.145 --> 14:23.080
My cousin slid out feet first
in a pickle barrel.

14:23.148 --> 14:25.015
My uncle was born
during rainy season

My brother, hmm, born under
a crowded noodle bar

14:29.187 --> 14:31.522

his happy dancing shrimp.

Nothing can stop us.

14:33.024 --> 14:35.676
Not the hurricanes.
Not the communists.

Not the feds.
Not the girl scouts.

I'm the worst.

14:41.766 --> 14:44.768
Well, that's a discussion
for a different time.

14:44.836 --> 14:47.271
Look, Britta,
there is something in you

14:47.338 --> 14:49.106
that wants to take care
of people so bad

14:49.174 --> 14:50.841
that you'll do it
until you puke.

14:50.909 --> 14:52.710
That's what Shirley needs
right now.

14:52.777 --> 14:54.612
Are you saying I'll be
a good mom?

14:54.679 --> 14:56.447
What? No.

14:56.514 --> 14:58.682
Man, you will really force
anything, won't you?

14:58.733 --> 15:03.153
Just get in there and force
that baby out of Shirley.

15:03.221 --> 15:06.223
Step aside, people!
Britta for the win!

15:06.291 --> 15:08.208
Not the girl scouts.
Not the--

15:08.293 --> 15:11.361
Get out of my way.
Okay. I am ready.

15:11.413 --> 15:14.031
Abed, walk me through this.

15:14.082 --> 15:15.198
Okay, at each contraction,

15:15.250 --> 15:16.800
you need to tell Shirley
to push.

15:16.868 --> 15:18.035
That's it?

15:18.086 --> 15:19.570
Well, don't tell any doctors
I said this,

15:19.638 --> 15:20.587
but at this point in time,

15:20.672 --> 15:21.839
the bus pretty much drives
itself.

15:21.890 --> 15:23.223
Who exactly is the bus
in this scenario? Oh!

15:23.308 --> 15:24.241
- Oooooh!
- Push!

15:32.150 --> 15:34.518
The head is out!

15:34.586 --> 15:37.821
Now feel under the neck
for the umbilical cord.

15:37.889 --> 15:38.989
There's no chord.

15:39.057 --> 15:40.524
I think that's a good thing,
Britta.

15:40.592 --> 15:43.027
Oh, I am nailing this!
You're doing great too.

15:43.094 --> 15:45.329
Chang, more stories.

15:45.396 --> 15:46.597
Okay, so in World War II,

15:46.665 --> 15:48.565
a lot of us were rounded up
in labor camps.

15:48.616 --> 15:49.917
Mining mostly.

15:50.001 --> 15:52.086
Hundreds of Changs were born
underneath the earth.

15:52.170 --> 15:55.289
Most spent their first five
years underground.

15:55.373 --> 15:58.709
- Hey, I'm here.
- Oh, Andre!

15:58.777 --> 16:01.078
Okay. Hi, baby.

16:01.129 --> 16:02.930
- It's gonna be all right.
- Okay.

16:03.014 --> 16:04.882
It's okay, ma'am.
We can take it from here.

16:04.933 --> 16:06.266
Guys, I got it.
I'm in the zone.

16:06.351 --> 16:08.135
Okay, come on, Shirley.
Come on, Shirley.

16:08.219 --> 16:09.820
Come on, Shirley.
Push push push.

16:09.888 --> 16:10.921
- Push it!
- Push!

16:10.989 --> 16:13.423
It's baby Greendale.

16:13.475 --> 16:14.958
You guys don't have
to name it that.

16:15.026 --> 16:17.127
I don't claim that power.
I'm merely the deliverer.

16:17.195 --> 16:19.563
- Britta, focus.
- Oh, doy. Okay.

16:19.631 --> 16:23.784
Come on, Shirley.

16:23.868 --> 16:25.636
Oh, it's a boy!

16:27.105 --> 16:30.374
And it's also a black person!

16:30.442 --> 16:32.042
Not that that's important.

16:32.110 --> 16:34.211
- Are you sure it's yours, baby?
- Yes.

16:34.279 --> 16:35.629
It's definitely his.

16:35.714 --> 16:36.814
I never told you this part,

16:36.881 --> 16:39.650
but all Changs are born
with tails.

16:39.718 --> 16:42.553
You kind of dodged
a bullet there.

16:42.620 --> 16:45.089
Agh! Ugh!

16:45.156 --> 16:48.892
Did that just happen?

16:48.960 --> 16:54.398
- It's back.
- It never left.

16:54.466 --> 16:56.734
- Hi.
- Oh.

16:56.801 --> 17:00.771
Oh.

17:00.839 --> 17:05.742
- Oh, we did it, sugar boots.
- No, you did it, baby.

17:05.810 --> 17:06.910
Congratulations, sir.

17:06.978 --> 17:09.346
After a fierce campaign,
I happily concede

17:09.414 --> 17:10.614
this baby to you.

17:10.682 --> 17:13.951
- Pretty classy of me.
- Thank you, Chang.

17:14.002 --> 17:15.786
Couldn't have done this
without you.

17:15.837 --> 17:18.005
- No bigs.
- Andre.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.173
Yeah.

17:19.257 --> 17:21.892
I think I want to name him
after Ben.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
- What?
- Hmm?

17:23.027 --> 17:24.595
- Really?
- Really?

17:24.662 --> 17:26.230
Yeah. I mean, you may not
be his father,

17:26.297 --> 17:29.600
but you helped bring him
into the world.

17:29.667 --> 17:33.353
All right, well, we'll have
our own little baby Ben...

17:33.438 --> 17:35.506
- Bennett.
- Ben Bennett?

17:35.573 --> 17:36.774
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, damn.

17:36.841 --> 17:39.193
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. No, no. No, that's fine.

17:39.277 --> 17:44.782
Ben Bennett.
Hi, Ben Bennett.

17:44.849 --> 17:46.116
Oh, look, he said Chang.

17:46.184 --> 17:47.684
- No.
- No, he didn't.

17:47.735 --> 17:51.889
- See? Nothing to it.
- Yeah.

17:51.956 --> 17:53.190
Can you believe
that's how we come

17:53.258 --> 17:54.224
into this world?

17:54.292 --> 17:57.211
Screaming, crying,
covered in crap?

17:57.295 --> 17:58.996
And then somewhere
along the lines,

17:59.063 --> 18:00.798
we get it into our heads
that we're destined

18:00.865 --> 18:01.899
for greatness.

18:01.966 --> 18:03.667
We are. I just yanked
a little dude

18:03.735 --> 18:05.836
out of my friend.

18:05.904 --> 18:09.807
Yeah. I guess we passed
Anthropology.

18:09.874 --> 18:12.542
Look at how teeny
his hands are.

18:12.594 --> 18:13.811
You're so little, right?

18:13.878 --> 18:15.412
His fingers
are like good & plenties.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.381
I know.
I want to eat them.

18:17.448 --> 18:20.384
- Which is lame.
- Totally.

18:20.451 --> 18:21.685
This has been quite a day.

18:21.753 --> 18:23.387
You can expect a cover story
in the next issue.

18:23.454 --> 18:25.455
In a good way?

18:25.523 --> 18:29.726
Like an article
about what a good dean I am?

18:29.777 --> 18:33.330
Absolutely.

18:33.398 --> 18:36.500
I did it.

18:36.567 --> 18:41.505
I did it.
I am a good dean.

18:41.572 --> 18:47.344
I am a good dean!
Whoo!

18:56.263 --> 18:57.793
Are you sure you want
to do this?

18:58.199 --> 18:59.632
I know people do it in movies
all the time,

18:59.688 --> 19:01.452
but there are bound to be
real world consequences.

19:01.453 --> 19:02.786
I know, but if we take
that test today,

19:02.854 --> 19:05.622
we are definitely going
to fail it.

19:05.690 --> 19:10.160
Okay, let's do it.

19:21.506 --> 19:22.823
What are you guys doing?

19:28.163 --> 19:30.597
Cancel school today
or we tell everybody about this.

19:30.665 --> 19:32.816
Deal.

19:33.016 --> 19:43.216
