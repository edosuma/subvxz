11:49.776 --> 11:51.910
(Groaning) (Hiccup sputters)

11:51.912 --> 11:54.913
Yeah, so... this is

11:54.915 --> 11:56.781
what I'm dealing with.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.049
What did you tell him?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.417
I-I didn't.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.019
By the time he turned around, I was gone.

12:01.043 --> 12:02.187
Huh.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.990
Well... it's a lot
of responsibility.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.293
The map will have to wait, for sure,

12:08.295 --> 12:09.928
and... and I'll need

12:09.930 --> 12:12.831
to fly toothless, since you'll be too busy, but...

12:13.899 --> 12:15.233
(Soft gasp)

12:15.235 --> 12:18.336
I-it's not me, Astrid.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.506
All those speeches and planning and running the village,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.141
that's his thing.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.343
I think you're missing the point.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.945
I mean... chief.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.379
What an honor!

12:28.381 --> 12:29.948
I'd be pretty excited.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.851
I-I... I'm not like you.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.120
You... know exactly
who you are,

12:35.122 --> 12:37.455
you always have, but...

12:37.457 --> 12:39.491
I'm still looking.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.260
I know that I'm not my father,

12:42.262 --> 12:45.296
and I never met my mother, so...

12:45.298 --> 12:47.432
What does that make me?

12:53.239 --> 12:57.375
What you're searching for isn't out there, hiccup...

12:57.377 --> 12:59.944
It's in here.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.081
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.116
Ugh. Ugh!
Maybe.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.918
But, you know...

13:06.920 --> 13:09.788
There is something out there.

Ooh!

14:40.280 --> 14:42.447
(Amazed gasps) Back again!

14:43.949 --> 14:46.384
Soil my britches.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.187
That is a night fury.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.289
Thought they were all gone for good.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.024
Looks like our luck's had a turn

14:53.026 --> 14:54.392
for the better, lads!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.361
Don't think drago has one of those...

14:56.363 --> 14:58.196
In his dragon army.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.497
Dragon army?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.499
Look, we don't want any trouble.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.935
Hah! You should
have thought of that

15:03.937 --> 15:06.404
before you stole all of our dragons

15:06.406 --> 15:07.972
and blasted our fort to bits!

15:07.974 --> 15:09.674
Man: That's right!
Man 2: Yeah, look it at!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.109
Hiccup:
Wait.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.343
What are you talking about?

15:12.345 --> 15:13.978
You think we did this?

15:13.980 --> 15:17.582
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

15:17.584 --> 15:20.018
without do-gooder dragon riders

15:20.020 --> 15:23.988
sneaking in to rescue them.
What do-gooder...?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.658
There are other dragon riders?
You mean

15:26.660 --> 15:29.560
other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.029
You may have

15:31.031 --> 15:32.664
an ice-spitting dragon
on your side,

15:32.666 --> 15:35.233
but we still have a quota to fill.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.468
How do you suppose we explain this mess

15:37.470 --> 15:39.003
to drago bludvist?

15:39.005 --> 15:40.505
Drago what-fist?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.507
Does anything you say make sense?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.342
He's expecting a new shipment of dragons

15:44.344 --> 15:46.544
for his army by tomorrow.

15:46.546 --> 15:50.248
And drago don't take well to excuses!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.083
This is what he gave me

15:52.085 --> 15:54.452
last time I showed up
empty-handed.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.556
He promised to be far less understanding in the future.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.426
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

16:01.428 --> 16:02.694
or an ice-spitting dragon

16:02.696 --> 16:04.696
or your lunatic boss

16:04.698 --> 16:07.131
and his dragon army, okay?

16:07.133 --> 16:10.234
Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go...

16:10.236 --> 16:13.037
Strange, hostile person whom we've never met.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.039
Oh, where are my manners?
(Chuckles)

16:15.041 --> 16:16.441
I'm eret...

16:16.443 --> 16:19.243
Son of eret.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.512
Finest dragon trapper alive.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.314
Others: Yeah.
After all...

16:23.316 --> 16:27.285
It's not just anyone who can capture a night fury.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.320
And this is toothless.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.589
He says we're going. Now.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.724
Hah!

16:32.726 --> 16:34.325
They all say that.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.593
Rush 'em, lads!

16:35.595 --> 16:38.763
(Men shouting)

16:41.500 --> 16:44.068
Astrid:
Stormfly, come on!

16:44.070 --> 16:45.336
Go! Go!

16:48.340 --> 16:50.341
You will

16:50.343 --> 16:52.210
never hold on to those dragons!

16:52.212 --> 16:53.511
You hear me?!

16:53.513 --> 16:56.280
Drago is coming for them all!

16:58.784 --> 17:02.553
Come on, meatlug!
Whoo-hoo! Yahoo!

17:02.555 --> 17:04.555
(Dragons chittering)

17:04.557 --> 17:06.324
(Shouting happily)
(Startled shriek)

17:06.326 --> 17:08.226
(Grunts)

17:08.228 --> 17:11.194
(Laughing)

17:11.196 --> 17:12.597
Hey there, stoick!
Hey, how are you?

17:12.621 --> 17:13.765
Beautiful day.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.067
Hello, spitelout. Great race.
Yeah... (Mumbling)

17:16.069 --> 17:17.635
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. ack.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.338
(Quietly): Any sign of him?
Eh! He's probably flown

17:20.339 --> 17:22.640
off the edge of the world by now.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.108
You sure you want that kid running the village?

17:25.111 --> 17:27.211
You can still delay your retirement.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.781
Oh, he's ready.
You'll see.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.383
(Hearty laugh) There he is!

17:32.385 --> 17:35.053
Huh?
The pride of berk!

17:36.522 --> 17:39.657
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.426
Sorry, got held up.
Hey, uh, dad,

17:41.428 --> 17:42.760
could I have a word?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.429
Something you're itching to tell me?

17:44.431 --> 17:47.465
Uh, not quite the itch you're thinking of, but, yes.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.666
Oh, good man!

17:48.668 --> 17:50.701
Now, lesson one:
A chief's first duty

17:50.703 --> 17:52.070
is to his people,

17:52.072 --> 17:53.404
so... 41!

17:53.406 --> 17:55.273
Well, can we just talk in private for...

17:55.275 --> 17:56.307
Forty...
Man: That's me!

17:56.309 --> 17:57.542
That's me! I'm next!

17:57.544 --> 17:58.744
Man 2: Hey, I was
ahead of you!

17:58.768 --> 18:00.111
If we could just talk...

18:00.113 --> 18:02.180
Excuse me.
I've been here all day.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.549
Okay, okay, I want one of those high seaters

18:04.551 --> 18:07.819
with lots of spikes and a big storage compartment!

18:07.821 --> 18:11.322
Absolutely! You got it, sir.
Dad, this is actually

18:11.324 --> 18:13.125
a little more important than building saddles.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.293
Ah, lesson two:
No task is too small

18:15.295 --> 18:17.195
when it comes to serving your people.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.297
But, dad...
Oh, excuse us, grump.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.599
Can we just talk...
Yah! Grump!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.835
You let the forge die down again!

18:23.837 --> 18:25.570
(Grumbles)

18:25.572 --> 18:26.838
(Yells)

18:26.840 --> 18:29.674
Ah...

18:29.676 --> 18:31.836
Gobber: That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.311
Okay, uh...
There you go.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.580
Dad... yeah, but seriously,
go on. Have away.

18:35.582 --> 18:40.118
I really need to tell you about
this new land we came across.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.786
Another one?
Any new dragons?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.654
We didn't stick around to find out.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.424
These folks weren't particularly friendly.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.592
Gobber:
Oh, really?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.360
Your night fury and deadly nadder

18:49.362 --> 18:51.829
didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.364
No, this was different.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.333
Not the standard
run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

18:55.335 --> 18:56.667
I've come to enjoy.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.604
These guys were trappers.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.372
Dragon trappers.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.807
You should have seen their fort.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.810
All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.278
It was weird.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.880
I've never seen anything like it.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.549
A-and worst of all,
they thought we did it!

19:11.551 --> 19:14.385
You know, you two are gonna get
yourselves in serious trouble

19:14.387 --> 19:15.720
one of these days.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.890
Not everyone appreciates this way of life.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.191
Aye, gobber's right, son.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.859
Best we keep to our own.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.929
Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.764
Huh-huh?

19:26.766 --> 19:29.667
Once we make the big announcement!

19:29.669 --> 19:32.670
They are building a dragon army.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.708
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

19:37.710 --> 19:40.545
"Dargo... bloody fist"
or something.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.549
I'll bloody his fist with my face

19:44.551 --> 19:46.617
if he tries to take my dragon!

19:46.619 --> 19:47.652
Or mine!

19:47.654 --> 19:49.387
Ugh! You're such a moron.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.655
A beautiful moron.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.190
Yeah.
(Disgusted groan)

19:52.192 --> 19:55.359
Bludvist? Drago bludvist?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.195
Uh, yeah. Wait...

19:57.197 --> 19:58.729
You know him?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.801
Ground all dragons!
Hiccup: What? Why?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.670
Stoick:
Seal the gates!

20:05.672 --> 20:07.805
Lower the storm doors!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.373
What is happening?
Gobber: Come on!

20:09.375 --> 20:10.741
You heard the man!
Lock it down!

20:10.743 --> 20:14.445
(Urgent chatter)
Stoick: No dragon or viking

20:14.447 --> 20:17.648
sets foot off this island until I give the word!

20:17.650 --> 20:19.770
Wait, because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble

20:19.794 --> 20:20.985
in some faraway land?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.921
Because drago bludvist is a madman

20:23.923 --> 20:26.357
without conscience or mercy.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.259
And if he's built a dragon army,

20:28.261 --> 20:29.827
gods help us all.

20:29.829 --> 20:30.995
Get them into their pens!

20:30.997 --> 20:32.730
Quickly!
Aye, stoick.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.665
Then let's ride back out there.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.667
We'll follow those trappers to drago

20:36.669 --> 20:38.469
and talk some sense into him.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.937
No. We fortify the island.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.973
It's our duty to keep the peace.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.708
Peace is over, hiccup.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.711
I must prepare you for war.
War?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.980
Dad, if drago's coming for our dragons,

20:48.982 --> 20:51.849
we can't wait around for him to get here.

20:51.851 --> 20:55.319
Let's go find him and change his mind.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.321
No, some minds won't be changed, hiccup.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.724
Berk is what you need to worry about.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.293
A chief protects his own.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.728
(Warbles quietly)

21:03.730 --> 21:06.264
Stoick: Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

21:06.266 --> 21:08.266
Hiccup, don't.
I have to.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.600
Stoick:
This way!

21:09.602 --> 21:10.801
Quickly!
(Toothless screeches)

21:12.004 --> 21:14.005
Hiccup!

21:15.674 --> 21:16.841
Come on!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.311
Hiccup!
Aah!

don't really care

22:31.684 --> 22:34.085

33:50.496 --> 33:52.095
I mean, what the...?

33:52.097 --> 33:54.131
Do you... do you grasp how
insane it sounds?

33:54.133 --> 33:55.365
Come quickly.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.533
I have questions!

33:56.535 --> 33:58.402
(Grunting) Where have you...

33:58.404 --> 34:00.404
Been all this time?
(Groans)

34:00.406 --> 34:01.571
(Groans)

34:01.573 --> 34:03.407
What-what have you been doing?

34:03.409 --> 34:06.343
But they-they said
you were dead!

34:06.345 --> 34:08.678
Everyone thinks you were eaten by...

34:08.679 --> 34:10.647
(Dragons bellowing, screeching)

34:17.621 --> 34:19.589
(Chittering)

34:21.793 --> 34:23.092
(Gasps)

34:26.130 --> 34:28.098
(Bellowing)

34:31.536 --> 34:33.503
(Screeching, warbling)

34:39.811 --> 34:41.777
(Screeching, bellowing, warbling continue)

34:43.547 --> 34:44.815
(Clears throat)

34:44.817 --> 34:46.149
(Gasps)

34:46.150 --> 34:49.152
(Low warbling)

34:49.154 --> 34:52.789
This is where you've been for 20 years?

34:54.592 --> 34:57.794
You-you've been rescuing them.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.632
Unbelievable.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.367
You're not upset?
What?

35:04.369 --> 35:06.169
No. I-I don't know. I...

35:06.171 --> 35:08.839
It's a bit much to get my head around, to be Frank.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.708
It's not every day you find out your mother

35:11.710 --> 35:15.879
is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.281
Oh... (Chuckles)

35:18.283 --> 35:19.883
Well...

35:19.885 --> 35:23.453
At least I'm not boring, right?
(Nervous chuckle)

35:23.455 --> 35:25.222
Well, I suppose there is that...

35:25.224 --> 35:28.325
One specific thing.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.160
Do-do you like it?

35:30.162 --> 35:31.228
I...

35:31.230 --> 35:32.496
I... I...

35:32.498 --> 35:34.464
I-I don't have the words.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.867
(Grumbling)

35:36.869 --> 35:39.469
(Sniffing)

35:39.471 --> 35:40.670
(Mother laughs)

35:40.672 --> 35:42.405
(Growls)

35:42.407 --> 35:44.608
C-can I...

35:44.610 --> 35:46.877
Oh, he's beautiful.

35:46.879 --> 35:48.478
Oh.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.147
(Chuckles)

35:50.149 --> 35:51.314
Oh, incredible.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.683
(Mother laughing)

35:53.685 --> 35:55.886
He might very well be the last of his kind.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.355
Oh... and look,

35:58.357 --> 35:59.890
he's your age.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.291
Wow.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.160
No wonder you get along so well.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.494
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.363
(Laughs)

36:06.365 --> 36:08.899
And retractable teeth.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.201
How did you manage...

36:11.203 --> 36:12.736
I found him in the woods.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.306
He was shot down and wounded.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.908
(Groans)

36:19.944 --> 36:22.679
This snafflefang lost his leg

36:22.681 --> 36:25.382
to one of drago bludvist's iron traps.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.850
This raincutter

36:26.852 --> 36:29.219
had her wing sliced by razor netting.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.588
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

36:31.590 --> 36:34.491
was blinded by a tree snare

36:34.493 --> 36:37.727
and then left to die alone and scared.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.796
And what of this?

36:39.798 --> 36:42.799
Did drago or his trappers do this, too?

36:42.801 --> 36:44.334
(Chuckles) Oh.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.835
Yeah. (Grunts)

36:45.837 --> 36:49.573
Well, crazy thing is...

36:49.575 --> 36:53.510
I'm actually the one who shot him down.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.279
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.347
He got me back.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.748
Right, bud?

36:58.750 --> 37:00.717
You couldn't save all of me, could you?

37:00.719 --> 37:02.485
You just had to make it even.

37:02.487 --> 37:05.355
So peg leg.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.324
(Laughs, grumbling)

37:08.859 --> 37:10.460
(Chuckles) Uh...

37:10.462 --> 37:12.963
What did your father think of your night fury friend?

37:12.965 --> 37:15.999
Oh, he-he didn't take
it all that well.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.300
(Grunts)

37:17.302 --> 37:19.869
But then, he changed.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.004
They all did.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.606
Pretty soon,

37:22.608 --> 37:25.442
everyone back home had dragons of their own.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.644
If only it were possible.

37:27.646 --> 37:28.745
No, really.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.814
Believe me, I tried, as well,

37:30.816 --> 37:33.850
but people are not capable of change, hiccup.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.385
Some of us...

37:35.387 --> 37:37.654
(Squawks)
Were just born different.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.656
(Screeching)

37:39.658 --> 37:41.658
(Townsfolk screaming)

37:41.660 --> 37:43.927
(Man shouts a warning, people clamor)

37:43.929 --> 37:46.863
Mother:
<i>Berk was a land of kill</i>

37:46.865 --> 37:48.431
<i>or be killed,</i>

37:48.433 --> 37:51.401
<i>but I believed peace was possible.</i>

37:51.403 --> 37:52.669
(Viking warrior bellows)

37:52.671 --> 37:55.672
Stop!
You'll only make it worse!

37:55.674 --> 37:59.342
Mother:
<i>It was a very unpopular opinion.</i>

37:59.344 --> 38:00.610
(Warrior yelling)

38:00.612 --> 38:02.512
Hiccup!

38:02.514 --> 38:04.314
Mother:
<i>Then one night,</i>

38:04.316 --> 38:07.417
<i>a dragon broke into our house, finding you</i>

38:07.419 --> 38:08.985
<i>in the cradle.</i>
(Gasps)

38:08.987 --> 38:12.355
<i>I rushed to protect you.</i>

38:12.357 --> 38:14.324
(Baby hiccup giggling)

38:16.027 --> 38:21.331
<i>But what I saw was proof of everything I believed.</i>

38:23.334 --> 38:25.302
(Cooing)

38:27.004 --> 38:29.873
(Baby hiccup crying, thudding footsteps)

38:31.942 --> 38:34.044
(Grunts gently)

38:34.046 --> 38:36.746
<i>This wasn't a vicious beast,</i>

38:36.748 --> 38:39.683
<i>but an intelligent, gentle creature,</i>

38:39.685 --> 38:43.386
<i>whose soul reflected my own.</i>

38:43.388 --> 38:45.021
(Stoick grunts, dragon bellows)

38:45.023 --> 38:48.391
Valka, run!
No, don't.

38:48.393 --> 38:50.593
(Valka gasps)

38:50.595 --> 38:52.896
Oh...

38:52.898 --> 38:54.064
Hold on!

38:54.066 --> 38:55.765
(Grunts)

38:55.767 --> 38:58.101
No! Aah! Stoick!

38:58.103 --> 39:00.470
Stoick:
Valka!

39:01.439 --> 39:04.074
Stoick!

39:04.076 --> 39:06.810
Valka.

39:06.812 --> 39:10.080
Valka:
<i>You and your father nearly died</i>

39:10.082 --> 39:11.681
that night.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.684
All because I couldn't kill a dragon.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.887
Eh, runs in the family.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.956
It broke my heart to stay away,

39:19.958 --> 39:23.426
but I believed you'd be safer if I did.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.563
How did you survive?

39:26.565 --> 39:28.832
Oh, cloudjumper never meant to harm me.

39:28.834 --> 39:32.969
He must have thought I belonged here

39:32.971 --> 39:36.906
in the home of the great bewilderbeast.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.110
The Alpha species.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.978
One of the very few

39:41.980 --> 39:43.947
that still exist.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.549
(Deep grumbling)

39:46.551 --> 39:47.684
Every nest has its queen,

39:47.686 --> 39:51.121
but this is the king of all dragons.

39:51.123 --> 39:53.523
With his icy breath,

39:53.525 --> 39:56.126
this graceful giant built our nest,

39:56.128 --> 39:59.562
a safe haven for dragons everywhere.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.865
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

40:01.867 --> 40:03.733
He's responsible

40:03.735 --> 40:04.901
for all that destruction?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.770
He protects us.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.105
We all live under his care

40:09.107 --> 40:10.940
and his command.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.877
(Screeching, chattering)

40:13.879 --> 40:16.012
Valka: All but the babies,
of course...

40:16.014 --> 40:18.882
(Squawks)

40:18.884 --> 40:20.617
...who listen to no one.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.552
(Valka chuckles)

40:23.587 --> 40:25.555
Aw... (Laughs)

40:28.726 --> 40:30.693
(Deep grunting)

40:34.465 --> 40:36.533
I've lived among them for 20 years, hiccup,

40:36.535 --> 40:39.135
discovering their secrets.

40:42.072 --> 40:44.674
(Laughs) He likes you.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.176
Wow.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.710
You must be hungry.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.479
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.481
Good.

40:50.482 --> 40:51.881
It's feeding time.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.552
(Deep grunting)

40:59.023 --> 41:00.557
(Screeches)

41:00.559 --> 41:02.625
I don't like it.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.761
They should've been back with hiccup by now.

41:04.763 --> 41:05.929
I don't like it, either.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.131
(Splashing) Eret, son of eret,

41:07.155 --> 41:08.798
was the man of my dreams.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.200
My everything!

41:10.202 --> 41:12.669
But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.604
Me, too.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.105
What if drago shot them down?

41:16.107 --> 41:18.808
What if they need our help?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.577
We have to find them.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.611
Wait, wait, what?

41:21.613 --> 41:22.779
No, but stoick said...

41:22.781 --> 41:24.013
It doesn't matter what he said

41:24.015 --> 41:25.215
if they've all been captured.

41:25.217 --> 41:26.583
Come on!

41:26.585 --> 41:28.551
(Rumbling)

41:29.587 --> 41:31.688
No-name:
Do we go back?

41:31.690 --> 41:32.956
Eret:
We've nowhere to go,

41:32.958 --> 41:34.958
nothing to sell, and no heads

41:34.960 --> 41:36.226
to call our own.

41:36.228 --> 41:37.861
Uh, eret...?
If we don't turn up

41:37.863 --> 41:40.230
with dragons and fast...

41:40.232 --> 41:41.764
(Screaming)

41:41.766 --> 41:43.766
Careful what you wish for!

41:43.768 --> 41:45.535
Do something!
Eret, son of eret!

41:45.537 --> 41:46.537
We'll miss you, eret!

41:46.538 --> 41:47.538
What is this?

41:47.539 --> 41:48.705
A kidnapping.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.240
Yay, can he ride with me?
Can he?

41:50.242 --> 41:51.541
(Fondly):
Can he...?

41:51.543 --> 41:52.909
(Groans)

41:52.911 --> 41:54.911
You're gonna show us the way to drago.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.579
And help dragon riders

41:56.581 --> 41:58.081
sneak into drago's camp?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.148
Just kill me now.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.250
That could be arranged.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.918
Stormfly, drop it.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.586
Huh? (Screaming)

42:04.588 --> 42:05.855
Good girl!

42:05.857 --> 42:08.892
(Screeches) Stormfly, fetch.

42:08.894 --> 42:09.894
(Screaming)

42:09.895 --> 42:10.994
All right!

42:10.996 --> 42:13.963
Okay! I'll take you to drago!

42:13.965 --> 42:15.865
(Screaming)

42:15.867 --> 42:17.600
Works every time.

42:17.602 --> 42:18.768
(Eret mutters anxiously)

42:22.873 --> 42:25.775
(Dragons screeching)

42:25.777 --> 42:28.278
Hey, I-I thought
we were going to eat.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.046
Oh, we are.

42:35.252 --> 42:37.287
(Rumbling)

42:37.289 --> 42:40.223
(Bellowing)

42:45.663 --> 42:46.863

42:46.865 --> 42:48.698
(Laughs)

42:49.733 --> 42:51.034
(Screeching)

43:00.844 --> 43:04.113
And then, from dragon island, I found this archipelago...

43:11.055 --> 43:12.922
There.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.658
(Sighs) Whoa.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.760
(Toothless bellows)

43:22.766 --> 43:25.234
(Chuckles)

43:29.873 --> 43:31.608

43:31.610 --> 43:33.109

valka:
Oh, when I'm up here,

44:07.112 --> 44:08.978
I don't even feel the cold.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.346
I just feel...

44:10.348 --> 44:12.682
Free.

(Sighs)

44:13.985 --> 44:15.418
(Laughs quietly)

44:15.420 --> 44:17.387
This is what it is

44:17.389 --> 44:20.657
to be a dragon, hiccup.

44:20.659 --> 44:22.725
It's all well and good

44:22.727 --> 44:23.960
to call yourself a dragon,

44:23.962 --> 44:25.194
but can you fly?

We just about had it that time.
