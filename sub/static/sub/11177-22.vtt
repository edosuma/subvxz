- And the latest on Iraq...
- Hey, George Michael.

They're gonna show that interview you did.
We're gonna watch it on Thursday, okay?

- Oh. Yeah.

Buddy, you gotta
take it easy, okay?

00:45.633 --> 00:47.533
I'm showing this
as a model again.

00:47.635 --> 00:50.468

we've got shoddy workmanship.

That might not
have been your fault.

in this house.

- Tell me about it.
- Is that a shot at me?

01:00.014 --> 01:02.642
- <i>Probably.</i>
- Because for your information, I got a job.

01:02.750 --> 01:05.810
- Really? What kind of job?
- Beads.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.083
- Bees?
- Beads.
- Beads?

01:09.190 --> 01:12.387
- Gob's not on board.
- Beads are very big right now.

Uh, anklets,
necklaces, you name it.

- Bracelets?
- But I'll need some start-up money.

gonna need a lot.

Gob, shouldn't you
be in bed?

01:25.072 --> 01:27.097
Well, we got a meeting
with Dad's attorney today.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.108
He's gonna want me to
take a lie-detector test...

01:29.210 --> 01:31.940
to use as evidence
in Dad's trial, but, uh, I don't want to.

01:32.046 --> 01:34.514
What if they ask about a magic trick?
I just... I can't risk it.

01:34.615 --> 01:38.517
They're not gonna ask you anything.
They want me to take the polygraph test.

- Sure. I will.

throw it away on another failed business.

- I mean, how do you not have sex with me?

to the bank.

- Why aren't you in there?

- That's okay. We've got your polygraph

- About that...
- <i>I'll tell them, Michael.</i>

- They don't want you.

- Good.
- I might not be the best witness either.

- I got a phone call from Kitty this morning.
- His secretary?

04:00.194 --> 04:02.594
- My secretary.
- <i>She says that she's got some evidence...</i>

- <i>when George Michael made a new friend.</i>
- Hi.

- Hi.
- Are bananas high in carbohydrates?

<i>Oh, you're</i>
<i>on Atkins too?</i>

05:01.822 --> 05:05.223
Uh, yeah. Actually, that's, um...
that's why I'm gonna be on... on TV.

05:05.326 --> 05:08.887
- You are?
- I was interviewed for <i>Hindsight,</i> with John Beard.

05:08.996 --> 05:12.261
I, uh, I gave them a joke,
but I don't know if they're gonna use it.

You know, thanks to this diet craze,
the last time we had a customer...

05:15.336 --> 05:17.065
the banana stand
was still green.

05:17.171 --> 05:21.505
Lose it. No, lose the whole kid.
We'll just go with the Iraq piece.

- That's so cool.
- I guess.

05:46.467 --> 05:50.369
Can we please have one conversation
that's not about my rack, Michael?

05:50.471 --> 05:52.769
- Yeah.
- Maybe a better question would be...

05:52.873 --> 05:54.704
what evidence do I have
against you, because...

05:54.808 --> 05:56.708
No, no, no. I don't...
I don't wanna know.

05:56.810 --> 05:59.108
I just want to know
what you want.

05:59.213 --> 06:01.704
I'd like to be in charge
of the Bluth Company.

06:01.815 --> 06:05.046
Well, I want a hamburger and French fries,
but I can't have the bun or potatoes. Get real.

06:05.152 --> 06:08.644
I deserve it. Your father promised it
to me on the day he went to prison.

06:10.324 --> 06:12.884
Sounds like something
that he would do.

06:12.993 --> 06:16.793
<i>And if I can't be in charge, then I'm</i>
<i>going to have to tell the entire world...</i>

- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop.

Um, without paying what? Taxes?

06:26.173 --> 06:29.734

And he hid it...

That's it? That's what
my dad's been hiding... back taxes?

And unless you plan
on paying them...

06:38.585 --> 06:41.986
your dad's gonna be
in prison for a long time.

06:42.089 --> 06:45.923
No, we'll pay them. Forget it. We'll just...
We'll mortgage the company if we have to.

06:46.026 --> 06:48.586
We found money for those.
We'll find money for taxes. Good to see ya.

06:48.696 --> 06:53.759
Yeah. If I was in charge,
that would have been my first move too.

Great news. The business

No, l-I meant... Well...
You haven't been eating those, have you?

07:06.213 --> 07:09.705
- No. No. Not at all. Just some nuts.
- Good. Those are fine.

- Great news, Michael.

Actually, I am the breadwinner, Michael,

<i>saw a book he'd written</i>
<i>years earlier as a psychiatrist.</i>

07:47.521 --> 07:49.887
<i>The book, initially unsuccessful,</i>
<i>had suddenly caught fire...</i>

<i>although, strangely,</i>
<i>only in the gay community.</i>

07:54.328 --> 07:57.855
The book is huge. And I have a bit
of money coming my way as a result.

<i>So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to</i>
<i>go upstairs and run the shower.</i>

08:01.301 --> 08:03.496

08:03.604 --> 08:05.538
Okay, honey.

So, your husband comes into some money,
and suddenly he's not so oblivious anymore, huh?

08:08.942 --> 08:11.240
Hey, now, this is not me
being shallow, Michael.

08:11.345 --> 08:13.870
He's written a self-help book
that's helping people.

08:13.981 --> 08:15.881
- That does take some insight.
- Listen.

08:15.983 --> 08:17.883
This better not mean
you're blowing off the bead store.

08:17.985 --> 08:21.751
Well, uh, seeing as though you brought it up,
maybe we should get out of this investment.

08:21.855 --> 08:24.517
- I mean, seriously, Michael... beads?
- I knew you'd do this.

08:24.625 --> 08:27.253
You work for three seconds,
and you find something easier and grab it.

they've made themselves right at home.

Now, a lot of this damage
is just due to shoddy workmanship...

is that these homes...

There's a good chance
I may have committed some light treason.

09:35.129 --> 09:39.122
This might even be
considered light treason.

09:59.853 --> 10:02.515
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Kitty was meeting with Gob at the time.</i>

10:02.623 --> 10:06.354
- What about hash browns?
- No, because hash browns are potatoes.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.860
So you really can't
eat anything on this diet.

10:08.962 --> 10:12.056
Wow. Wonder how this
is gonna affect my honey business?

10:12.166 --> 10:14.566
Gob, I have seen you
get passed over...

10:14.668 --> 10:16.966
time and time again
by your family.

10:17.070 --> 10:19.334
You don't deserve that.
You're smarter than them.

10:19.439 --> 10:24.172
What about macaroni...

10:24.278 --> 10:26.769
Gob, this is your time.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.781
With my help,
knowing what I know...

10:29.883 --> 10:34.013
- we could take over the Bluth Company together.
- Wow!

10:34.121 --> 10:36.555
This is a side of you
I'd never noticed before.

10:36.657 --> 10:40.184

been that big?

<i>[Narrator] And the next day,</i>
<i>Michael went to his mother's.</i>

10:42.496 --> 10:45.522
I saw an exposé
on the Iraq palaces last night...

10:45.632 --> 10:48.192
and I could have sworn that one of them
was the Sea Wind unit.

10:48.302 --> 10:52.864
That's funny. I always pictured Iraq
in the middle of the desert.

10:52.973 --> 10:54.634
Dad sold houses to the Iraqis,
didn't he?

10:54.741 --> 10:57.266
And this is what you kept from me
so I could take the polygraph test.

10:57.377 --> 11:00.540
Tell me the truth, okay? 'Cause there's been
a lot of lying in this family.

11:00.647 --> 11:02.638
And a lot of love.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.274
- More lies.
- Look, I never knew about anything.

11:05.385 --> 11:07.683
But I had my suspicions.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.688
He never told me
where he was going...

11:09.790 --> 11:13.385
but he used to come back from those
business trips reeking of lamb.

<i>And people would send figs</i>...

Oh, and once,
someone sent him a toe...

11:21.268 --> 11:23.361

as a sheet.

11:23.470 --> 11:26.564

Sick of playing second fiddle.

Tired of finishing fourth.

- and I'm taking over.
- You want to be in charge?

11:45.359 --> 11:47.520
- Yeah.
- You want to deal with what I deal with...

a sister who takes your money
and throws it away;

11:51.098 --> 11:52.998
a mother
who you can't trust;

11:53.100 --> 11:56.228
a company whose founder
may be on trial for treason...

11:56.336 --> 11:58.600
Is that what you want?

11:58.705 --> 12:03.142
- What kind of vacation time does it offer?
- Yeah.

- She wants my job.

Suddenly everybody wants my job,

13:27.794 --> 13:30.285
No, all she thinks it is
is unpaid taxes.

13:30.397 --> 13:33.230
Yeah. What if she gives it to someone

He just, uh, got away from us.
I'm sorry.

<i>Uh, can we go in there?</i>

God, I've missed bread.
Mmm.
