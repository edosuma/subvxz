WEBVTT

01:01.710 --> 01:03.712
* *

01:33.033 --> 01:34.201
Yo, check it out, it's Dex.

01:34.236 --> 01:35.828
He's going to do it.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.872
Oh, dude,
it's the Jack-in-the-Box.

01:46.255 --> 01:47.089
Whoo!

02:11.322 --> 02:13.365
Oh, my God, he's got no head.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.623
Cops are coming.

02:14.658 --> 02:16.952
Let's get out of here.

02:49.610 --> 02:51.612
Gentlemen.

02:52.279 --> 02:55.199
Wolfe, you got the
head over there?

02:55.234 --> 02:56.533
Yeah.

02:56.909 --> 03:00.120
But how did it get
15 feet from its body?

03:06.794 --> 03:08.761
Maybe, gentlemen,

03:08.796 --> 03:11.048
maybe it had some help.

03:20.307 --> 03:25.521
Well, vic needed some elevation
to make contact with this wire.

03:31.986 --> 03:35.531
911 call said there was
a sideshow going on over here.

03:35.566 --> 03:36.615
What do you mean sideshow?

03:36.650 --> 03:37.700
It's a party.

03:37.825 --> 03:40.661
Kids in tricked-out cars
doing stunts.

03:41.078 --> 03:43.497
That's the only way our vic
could have got that high.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.516
Well, if this
was a stunt gone wrong,

03:45.551 --> 03:47.501
then how come
everybody took off?

03:47.536 --> 03:49.670
Because this...

03:49.878 --> 03:52.840
was not an accident.

03:52.881 --> 03:56.385
* Yeah! *

04:15.279 --> 04:18.531
* We don't get fooled again *

04:19.158 --> 04:23.329
* Don't get fooled again *

04:45.958 --> 04:48.133
What, no Alexx?

04:48.168 --> 04:50.796
Falls under "obvious death. "

04:51.046 --> 04:52.881
What's his name?

04:54.416 --> 04:55.751
Name's Dexter Gilman.

04:55.786 --> 04:56.710
Nineteen.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.837
Let me ask you something.

05:01.673 --> 05:03.383
What are all these
lights and cables doing

05:03.418 --> 05:06.094
in the middle
of a parking lot?

05:06.220 --> 05:08.138
Yeah, well, uh, PD said

05:08.222 --> 05:09.973
there was a street fair
here a couple of days ago.

05:10.008 --> 05:12.430
City's not scheduled
to take them down.

05:12.465 --> 05:14.806
Oh, yeah?
And our headless horseman

05:14.841 --> 05:17.099
decided to utilize them
in his act?

05:17.134 --> 05:19.358
Yeah, well, based on
these tread marks,

05:19.393 --> 05:21.533
he wasn't the only one
performing.

05:21.568 --> 05:23.445
That means we're going to have
to collect everything.

05:23.487 --> 05:25.656
All right? Beer
bottles, beer cans,

05:25.691 --> 05:27.449
cigarette butts.
Everything.

05:27.484 --> 05:28.617
Yeah.

05:29.576 --> 05:31.787
Who's that guy? You know him?

05:33.705 --> 05:36.750
Nah. Never seen him before.

05:39.962 --> 05:40.636
Hey.

05:40.671 --> 05:41.964
Hey, this is an
active crime scene.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.513
Can I help you?

05:42.548 --> 05:45.467
Yeah. Mike Doyle.
Documentary filmmaker.

05:45.884 --> 05:46.927
Here to get some footage.

05:46.962 --> 05:48.303
Oh, yeah? Of what?

05:49.096 --> 05:50.104
Scanner said decapitation.

05:50.139 --> 05:51.807
Figured it might be pretty good.

05:51.842 --> 05:53.398
Looks like the ME, uh...

05:53.433 --> 05:55.289
the ME already bagged
he body? And the head?

05:55.324 --> 05:57.146
Look, Mike, I don't know
who you think you are,

05:57.187 --> 05:59.481
but this isn't a scene
in one of your movies.

05:59.516 --> 06:01.073
This is real life.

06:01.108 --> 06:03.277
That's exactly why I'm here.

06:03.485 --> 06:06.613
They want factual accounts
of what you CSIs do.

06:06.648 --> 06:07.990
Who's they?

06:08.449 --> 06:10.040
The mayor's office.

06:10.075 --> 06:12.126
The City signed off
on filming us?

06:12.161 --> 06:15.080
Yeah. Horatio said
they might try this.

06:15.122 --> 06:16.922
It's a public
relations move.

06:16.957 --> 06:19.168
To cast a better light
on your department.

06:19.203 --> 06:22.504
Why, because we had a mole?

06:25.424 --> 06:27.259
Look, take your camera
and your film

06:27.294 --> 06:29.553
and go somewhere else.

06:30.971 --> 06:33.306
Okay. Fair enough.

06:33.341 --> 06:35.642
Here's my card.

06:37.853 --> 06:39.646
Here's my card.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.736
We'll be in touch.

06:57.456 --> 06:58.839
Alexx, did we get anything?

06:58.874 --> 07:00.876
His head was severed
between the first

07:00.911 --> 07:03.003
and second cervical vertebrae.

07:03.038 --> 07:04.605
No soft tissue bridges.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.138
The incision is clean.

07:06.173 --> 07:09.217
Consistent with the cable
that we found at the scene.

07:09.252 --> 07:12.262
Yeah. A soup spoon can kill you
with enough velocity.

07:12.297 --> 07:14.681
<i>The boy was moving, Horatio.</i>

07:15.098 --> 07:19.269
What about
those markings on the arm?

07:20.354 --> 07:23.941
Based on the orange color,
it's postmortem.

07:25.275 --> 07:26.944
Look like a tire tread.

07:26.979 --> 07:27.945
Yep.

07:27.986 --> 07:31.156
<i>This baby boy was run over
after the fact.</i>

07:32.491 --> 07:35.661
The tread pattern is odd,
Horatio, like nothing I've seen.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.788
Yeah, it's no ordinary tire.

07:39.081 --> 07:40.958
Do you need a Microsil
impression of it?

07:40.993 --> 07:42.584
I'll send Boa Vista in.

07:42.619 --> 07:44.419
Thank you, Alexx.

08:13.115 --> 08:15.117
* *

08:24.668 --> 08:26.378
Nice work.

08:27.421 --> 08:29.638
Thanks.

08:29.673 --> 08:32.174
Almost documentary worthy,
wouldn't you say?

08:32.210 --> 08:34.678
By the way, I would've done
the same exact thing

08:34.712 --> 08:35.811
you and Eric did today.

08:35.846 --> 08:37.722
The last thing
that this department needs

08:37.758 --> 08:39.022
is more scrutiny.

08:39.057 --> 08:41.894
Scrutiny like your
covert investigation

08:42.227 --> 08:43.770
of our lab?

08:46.773 --> 08:48.282
You know, Ryan,
when I started here,

08:48.317 --> 08:50.611
I really did start
with the best intentions.

08:50.646 --> 08:51.945
And when it all
came crumbling down,

08:51.987 --> 08:53.412
I lost almost
every friend I had.

08:53.447 --> 08:55.032
So I would really hate to see
somebody else

08:55.067 --> 08:57.242
make that same mistake.

08:58.285 --> 09:01.663
Well, I agreed to do it.

09:03.373 --> 09:05.459
And let a camera crew
follow you around?

09:05.494 --> 09:06.794
Mm-hmm.

09:07.628 --> 09:09.094
And Horatio
okayed that?

09:09.129 --> 09:13.008
As long as it doesn't
interfere with my work, yeah.

09:13.425 --> 09:15.719
Natalia, somebody had to do it.

09:15.761 --> 09:17.554
So, you're going to fall
on the sword

09:17.589 --> 09:19.723
The lab needs
a clean slate.

09:20.182 --> 09:21.857
And you know what they say:

09:21.892 --> 09:24.895
"Sunlight is the
best disinfectant. "

09:26.855 --> 09:31.109
So, is this thing going
to tell us who ran him over?

09:33.362 --> 09:35.948
Well, it has a unique pattern,
minimal tread.

09:35.983 --> 09:38.123
And I did little digging.

09:38.158 --> 09:39.660
The tires
with this kind of tread

09:39.695 --> 09:41.870
are called "racing slicks. "

09:41.954 --> 09:43.288
Hey,oosiers.

09:44.248 --> 09:45.214
They're made for
serious abuse.

09:45.249 --> 09:48.217
They use them, actually,
over at the Miami Speedway.

09:48.252 --> 09:50.879
Someone's been testing their
street performance at sideshows.

09:50.914 --> 09:53.590
Maybe that someone knows
what happened to Dexter Gilman.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.926
Only one place that sells them
here in town.

09:55.961 --> 09:58.637
Place called Tread On Me.

09:58.679 --> 10:01.723
Then that's where I'll be.

10:07.646 --> 10:09.106
Yeah, I recognize the tread.

10:09.141 --> 10:09.982
They're Hoosier R6s.

10:10.017 --> 10:11.150
Racing tires.

10:11.441 --> 10:13.485
You sell these to teenagers?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.778
I run a business.

10:15.654 --> 10:17.906
Had one kid
used them for drifting.

10:17.941 --> 10:19.112
What's drifting?

10:19.147 --> 10:20.284
It's a stunt.

10:20.534 --> 10:21.250
Driver turns the front wheels

10:21.285 --> 10:22.870
in the opposite direction
of the turn.

10:31.545 --> 10:34.506
Tires have a good bite, but they
get destroyed pretty quickly.

10:34.541 --> 10:36.258
He was replacing them
every couple of weeks.

10:36.293 --> 10:38.093
He, huh? Who's he?

10:47.060 --> 10:48.854
His name is Dex Gilman.

10:49.354 --> 10:50.988
Dex Gilman's the vic
from this morning.

10:51.023 --> 10:54.067
You telling me he ran himself
over with his own car?

10:54.102 --> 10:55.777
I don't think that car
was totally his own.

10:55.812 --> 10:57.279
Oh, yeah? What do you mean?

10:57.314 --> 10:58.412
He drove it.

10:58.447 --> 11:01.033
But some girl by the name of,
uh, Brynn Roberts

11:01.068 --> 11:02.367
paid for every
new set of rubber.

11:02.402 --> 11:03.744
Brynn Roberts, huh?

11:03.827 --> 11:04.626
Anything else?

11:04.661 --> 11:06.497
Yeah, keep these tires
on the pro circuit.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.415
Stop selling them
to teenagers, okay?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.631
I didn't kill that kid.

11:09.666 --> 11:13.462
But you didn't care
if he lived or died, did you?

11:14.922 --> 11:18.675
So I understand that you and
Dex Gilman had a relationship.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.345
I guess you could call him
my boyfriend, yes.

11:23.013 --> 11:24.932
I need to take this.

11:25.015 --> 11:26.850
Let it go to voice
mail, please.

11:28.352 --> 11:29.943
I also
understand that

11:29.978 --> 11:32.272
Dex was buying
Hoosier racing tires

11:32.307 --> 11:33.857
and you were
footing the bill.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.275
I paid for the whole car.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.652
I was his sponsor.

11:37.152 --> 11:38.529
Do you know where
the car is right now?

11:38.564 --> 11:40.423
Someone drove off with it.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.282
I had to report it stolen.

11:42.616 --> 11:44.118
That's a hard day.

11:44.701 --> 11:45.918
Yeah.

11:45.953 --> 11:48.747
What happened this morning...

11:48.782 --> 11:50.415
wasn't part of the plan.

11:50.450 --> 11:51.792
What is your plan?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.045
Dad said he'll match
any money that I make

11:55.087 --> 11:57.131
before I turn 25.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.764
These sideshows

11:58.799 --> 12:01.969
could be my huge moneymaker
with the right marketing.

12:02.004 --> 12:03.387
What kind of marketing?

12:11.770 --> 12:12.855
The Web.

12:13.438 --> 12:14.773
When you're breaking
a new sport,

12:14.808 --> 12:16.859
it is all about video.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.034
So, you film
these sideshows?

12:19.069 --> 12:21.697
It's my plan
to attract investors.

12:21.864 --> 12:23.824
Well, in that case, I'd like
to see all the footage

12:23.859 --> 12:24.915
from this morning's event.

12:24.950 --> 12:27.744
I'd be more than happy
to show you.

12:28.203 --> 12:31.665
as soon you show me award.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.425
Hey. 99 bottles
of beer on the wall.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.255
You and Ryan collect all those
from the parking lot?

12:56.290 --> 12:58.858
Yeah, he's running
extracted liquids,

12:58.893 --> 13:01.427
cigarette butts and
drug paraphernalia.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.936
So...

13:03.971 --> 13:07.057
he's got DNA and Trace.

13:07.558 --> 13:09.393
You win the coin toss?

13:09.852 --> 13:10.693
No.

13:10.728 --> 13:13.480
I pulled my
seniority card.

13:13.515 --> 13:14.982
Ah. Perfect.

13:15.149 --> 13:17.818
Hey, I heard that you had
a visitor at the crime scene.

13:17.853 --> 13:18.325
Yeah.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.362
Some Michael
Moore wannabe.

13:20.571 --> 13:21.968
I told him to get lost.

13:22.003 --> 13:23.330
Unfortunately, I'm afraid

13:23.365 --> 13:24.957
someone's gonna get stuck
with the guy.

13:24.992 --> 13:28.871
Well, I can tell you that that
somebody is not going to be me.

13:31.207 --> 13:32.499
All right.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.502
Start your engines.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.705
Look like a tented
arch to you?

14:16.877 --> 14:19.088
Yeah, it does. That's rare.

14:20.047 --> 14:20.930
That's very rare.

14:20.965 --> 14:23.724
Less than five percent
of the population has it.

14:23.759 --> 14:26.679
And every one of these bottles
has the identical print.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.312
That would mean
that the same guy

14:28.347 --> 14:30.850
would have had to have
passed all of them out.

14:30.885 --> 14:34.019
Must have been
the life of the party.

14:42.069 --> 14:43.988
I got it.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.079
"Evan Dunlar.

14:45.114 --> 14:48.450
Internship at Lasgrove
Electronics Corporation. "

14:48.485 --> 14:52.121
Let's go see if the
intern likes fast cars.

14:52.204 --> 14:54.039
* *

14:56.750 --> 14:58.175
<i>You know, the guys sai</i>

14:58.210 --> 15:01.171
<i>"Make yourself useful,"
so I did.</i>

15:01.206 --> 15:03.883
<i>I manned the coolers.</i>

15:04.758 --> 15:08.762
We found your prints on
each of these bottles.

15:08.971 --> 15:10.347
It was a sideshow.

15:11.015 --> 15:13.017
These guys trick out
their cars,

15:13.052 --> 15:16.312
drive all crazy and stuff.

15:16.395 --> 15:17.479
Just want to hang out with them,

15:17.514 --> 15:18.529
that's all.

15:18.564 --> 15:20.336
It's reckless
driving, Evan.

15:20.371 --> 15:22.074
And it's against
the law.

15:22.109 --> 15:24.132
You giving these
guys an audience

15:24.167 --> 15:26.155
only makes you
part of the problem.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.791
Evan, this morning,

15:30.826 --> 15:33.037
a young man named
Dexter Gilman was killed.

15:33.072 --> 15:35.789
How well did
you know him?

15:36.874 --> 15:39.877
He was one of the best drivers.

15:41.253 --> 15:42.796
Did the Jack-in-the-Box.

15:42.831 --> 15:44.131
What's that?

15:44.173 --> 15:46.015
Peddle-free, cruise control,

15:46.050 --> 15:48.844
feet on the wheel,
head out the top.

15:49.303 --> 15:51.430
Unbelievable.

15:51.555 --> 15:53.439
And the girls loved him.

15:53.474 --> 15:57.311
Not enough to stick around
after he was decapitated.

15:59.313 --> 16:00.488
How 'bout you, Evan?

16:00.523 --> 16:03.567
Did you feel the need
to stick around?

16:03.776 --> 16:05.569
Dex's car came
up stolen.

16:05.604 --> 16:06.820
Did you take it?

16:08.364 --> 16:09.949
No, I didn't
steal Dex's car.

16:09.984 --> 16:11.033
I ran.

16:11.116 --> 16:13.994
Look, the cops come,
you break for it.

16:14.029 --> 16:16.664
It's just...
it's what you do.

16:16.747 --> 16:19.542
You know? I mean, it's that
or spend the night in jail.

16:24.129 --> 16:27.216
Man, the cops were on us
fast this time.

16:32.054 --> 16:34.056
Evan, we need names.

16:40.563 --> 16:43.190
I can't.

16:43.566 --> 16:44.198
If something happens,

16:44.233 --> 16:47.903
they're gonna know
that I'm talking to you guys.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.119
Evan, listen to me.

16:49.154 --> 16:53.993
We know you're involved, and you
could go to jail for this, son.

16:57.162 --> 17:00.040
So don't go far.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.672
Heard a kid had his head taken
off at a sideshow this morning.

17:06.707 --> 17:07.680
That's true.

17:07.714 --> 17:10.384
I need you to look into
something for me, please.

17:10.419 --> 17:11.676
You wondering who organized it?

17:11.712 --> 17:11.724
No.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.935
Quite the contrary-
who broke it up.

17:13.971 --> 17:17.974
The kid said that the police
were there in record time.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.476
Somebody on the inside
tipped them?

17:19.511 --> 17:20.483
It's possible.

17:20.519 --> 17:21.999
Let's see who made the call.

17:22.034 --> 17:23.480
I'll call 911, track it down.

17:23.515 --> 17:25.316
Thank you.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.416
I had some information,

17:35.451 --> 17:37.453
I thoughthe police
should know about it.

17:37.488 --> 17:38.836
I overheard my son, Evan,

17:38.871 --> 17:41.019
talking about one
of these sideshows

17:41.054 --> 17:43.167
a few days ago
where it would be.

17:43.709 --> 17:44.967
I'm a single parent.

17:45.002 --> 17:47.338
I got home from my job,
and my son wasn't there.

17:47.373 --> 17:49.673
Did he mention
anyone else's involvement?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.008
No, he didn't.

17:52.426 --> 17:53.767
This is my fault.

17:53.802 --> 17:56.033
I was the one encouraging him
to make new friends.

17:56.068 --> 17:58.265
I just never thought
he'd get wrapped up in this.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.648
Well, he's a teenager,
Mr. Dunlar,

17:59.683 --> 18:03.521
so don't... don't be
too hard on yourself.

18:05.856 --> 18:07.608
Evan was into cars as a kid.

18:08.776 --> 18:11.111
Toys, models, remote control.

18:11.529 --> 18:14.448
But now, he's playing
with the real thing.

18:14.483 --> 18:15.616
He could've been killed today.

18:15.651 --> 18:16.951
Yes, he could've.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.931
So here's what I'd
like you to do:

18:18.966 --> 18:20.871
go home and make sure
he's safe.

18:20.906 --> 18:22.498
Okay?

18:24.041 --> 18:25.132
Thank you.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.920
Thanks for coming in.

18:32.925 --> 18:33.724
Come on.

18:33.759 --> 18:36.470
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

18:36.846 --> 18:39.647
Answer.

18:39.682 --> 18:41.350
I'm headed to Judge
Harrison's for a warrant.

18:41.385 --> 18:42.274
What do you need?

18:42.309 --> 18:43.859
Trying to save you
the trip.

18:43.894 --> 18:47.982
Brynn Roberts already posted
her sideshow footage online.

18:49.066 --> 18:50.734
I don't need a warrant?

18:50.769 --> 18:51.986
I am loving you.

18:53.070 --> 18:54.425
I don't know if this helps.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.808
Camera's in a fixed position.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.157
She must've set up a tripod.

18:57.192 --> 18:58.742
Go ahead and run it.

19:01.370 --> 19:04.748
There's our vic.

19:05.249 --> 19:06.298
Jeez.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.295
I really wish
I could un-see that.

19:09.336 --> 19:11.922
I'm sorry,
can you play it again?

19:21.432 --> 19:24.018
Why didn't he clear
the last cable?

19:24.053 --> 19:24.817
No idea.

19:24.852 --> 19:28.522
Ryan said they were all hung
at the same height.

19:30.024 --> 19:31.150
Okay, again.

19:37.406 --> 19:40.534
Maybe the height
of the car changed.

19:40.659 --> 19:42.161
Can you measure
the height of the bumper?

19:42.196 --> 19:44.413
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think so.

19:50.336 --> 19:51.921
And get a measurement

19:51.962 --> 19:55.174
as he clears the second
to the last cable.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.262
Six inches.

20:00.346 --> 20:04.642
What's the measurement as
he collides with the last cable?

20:08.187 --> 20:10.523
17 inches.

20:10.648 --> 20:12.149
The car was raised.

20:13.651 --> 20:16.153
Hydraulics.

20:27.581 --> 20:30.167
Maybe he accidentally
set them off himself?

20:30.202 --> 20:30.633
I don't know.

20:30.668 --> 20:32.419
He was hanging out the sunroof,

20:32.454 --> 20:34.171
he was driving with his feet.

20:34.206 --> 20:35.172
I doubt it.

20:35.464 --> 20:37.800
Okay, that leaves, what?

20:38.217 --> 20:39.176
A malfunction?

20:39.211 --> 20:40.094
Maybe.

20:40.970 --> 20:43.229
Could be premeditated murder.

20:43.264 --> 20:47.059
Well, I know one person
who would profit from this.

20:47.094 --> 20:48.557
You weren't ilding a sport,

20:48.592 --> 20:49.985
you were trading
in sleaze.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.939
I bet you couldn't wait
to upload the footage.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.322
It's a male-dominated sport.

20:53.357 --> 20:56.005
You grab their attention
any way you can.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.619
I get all sorts of stuff
for this site.

20:58.654 --> 21:01.740
Well, the high tension wires
were certainly a success.

21:01.775 --> 21:03.092
Did you pick
the location?

21:03.127 --> 21:04.269
A matter of fact, I did.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.376
But I didn't kill Dex,

21:05.411 --> 21:07.830
if that's where you're going
with all of this.

21:07.865 --> 21:10.249
What about the hydraulics
that killed him?

21:10.284 --> 21:11.417
What are you talking about?

21:11.452 --> 21:13.919
Are you serious?

21:15.170 --> 21:16.838
Look, Dex wanted those in.

21:16.873 --> 21:18.507
He did it all himself.

21:24.972 --> 21:26.438
Gable and Third.

21:26.473 --> 21:27.648
Sounds like a sideshow.

21:27.683 --> 21:31.645
You know what? I'm gonna see
how they like our cars.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.816
* *

22:03.427 --> 22:06.437
This is Dexter
Gilman's car.

22:06.472 --> 22:08.933
Dex and I did
a few tandem stunts.

22:08.968 --> 22:10.201
Drifts and stuff.

22:10.236 --> 22:11.435
You guys teammates?

22:12.770 --> 22:15.147
More like friendly
competitors.

22:15.182 --> 22:16.614
You're some friend, Luke.

22:16.649 --> 22:20.277
He's in the morgue and
you're driving his car.

22:20.819 --> 22:22.655
I didn't have anything
to do with Dex's accident.

22:22.690 --> 22:23.614
I feel bad.

22:24.365 --> 22:26.450
Yeah, clearly.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.288
Luke, you ran over your
friend when you took his car.

22:31.323 --> 22:33.582
I couldn't just let
this beauty get impounded.

22:40.381 --> 22:41.945
Dex would have wanted me
to take it.

22:41.980 --> 22:43.509
I guess we'll never know,
will we?

22:43.544 --> 22:44.468
Officer.

22:44.552 --> 22:46.637
Book him on
auto theft.

22:48.973 --> 22:50.147
Why you sweating us for, man?

22:50.182 --> 22:51.391
Why you need the
registration for anyway?

22:51.426 --> 22:52.601
Why you trying
to run our plates, man?

22:52.636 --> 22:53.609
Run this guy's plates.

22:53.644 --> 22:55.980
He's the one with the problem.
Man, we was just here watching.

22:56.015 --> 22:57.165
We didn't even
do anything.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.315
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:58.350 --> 22:59.233
Shut up.

22:59.733 --> 23:01.283
Okay?

23:01.318 --> 23:03.612
Sound like a couple
of busted leaf blowers.

23:03.647 --> 23:05.120
We're just trying
to ride, mister.

23:05.155 --> 23:06.719
Look, man, it's about
what's under the hood, man.

23:06.754 --> 23:08.284
I don't give a damn what's
in the glove compartment.

23:08.319 --> 23:10.661
This vehicle's stolen,
smart-ass.

23:10.696 --> 23:11.745
No way.

23:11.787 --> 23:13.372
Well, the VIN number says way.

23:13.407 --> 23:14.582
All right?

23:14.623 --> 23:18.127
Take Tweedledee and Tweedledum
here for a ride.

23:19.753 --> 23:21.178
Six of these rides are hot,

23:21.213 --> 23:22.388
so now we're looking
at car thieves.

23:22.423 --> 23:26.385
Something else going on here,
Frank, bigger than this.

23:26.802 --> 23:28.282
I'll look into auto thefts

23:28.317 --> 23:29.728
over the last few days.

23:29.763 --> 23:31.307
Think there's a connection
to our murder?

23:31.342 --> 23:34.101
The car, Frank,
is going to tell us.

23:59.249 --> 24:00.423
Okay, so...

24:00.458 --> 24:02.585
the kids we busted at the
sideshow are throwing up

24:02.620 --> 24:05.505
all overhemselves to
give us information.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.888
Beats six months in jail.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.300
Yeah, unfortunately, none
of them knows a single thing

24:09.335 --> 24:11.761
about the death
of Dexter Gilman.

24:12.929 --> 24:15.098
Selective memory.

24:15.181 --> 24:16.147
Is that the blood

24:16.182 --> 24:18.233
that's left after
the cleanup?

24:18.268 --> 24:20.145
Yeah, we're not going to
need to run DNA on it.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.604
This is, um...

24:22.647 --> 24:25.275
This is definitely the car
Dexter got killed in.

24:25.310 --> 24:26.533
What we really need
to do is figure out

24:26.568 --> 24:29.863
how this car's
hydraulic lift was activated.

24:30.321 --> 24:31.802
Well, what about this?

24:31.837 --> 24:33.248
Is this the on-off switch?

24:33.283 --> 24:35.368
Yeah, but based on the stunt
that he was performing

24:35.403 --> 24:36.167
at the time, ther's no way

24:36.202 --> 24:39.330
he could have reached that
with his feet.

24:45.378 --> 24:49.841
Yeah, he's definitely not tall
enough to pull that move off.

24:59.351 --> 25:01.269
Little warning, please.

25:01.686 --> 25:03.438
Yeah.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.532
Sorry about that.

25:07.567 --> 25:10.987
On a positive note, we
now know that that works.

25:11.022 --> 25:12.739
Yeah.

25:12.781 --> 25:14.783
Glad your video guy
didn't see that.

25:14.818 --> 25:15.790
Yeah.

25:15.825 --> 25:19.204
He's supposed to start
in a couple of weeks.

25:27.545 --> 25:29.172
What is this?

25:29.756 --> 25:30.882
I don't know.

25:31.591 --> 25:33.385
Looks like a transmitter.

25:34.719 --> 25:36.262
Well, that would allow
the hydraulics

25:36.297 --> 25:38.098
to be activated remotely.

25:38.181 --> 25:40.517
And at exactly the right time.

25:46.523 --> 25:47.565
Whoo!

25:48.733 --> 25:52.570
Okay, so now our big question
is: who activated it and how?

25:52.605 --> 25:55.497
You know, Horatio
talked to a guy

25:55.532 --> 25:58.493
whose son is into
radio-controlled cars.

25:59.327 --> 26:01.579
I know it's kind of a stretch.

26:01.614 --> 26:04.416
Not by much.

26:14.718 --> 26:17.262
So, Wolfe, you're dragging
me out here because of

26:17.297 --> 26:19.636
Evan Dunlar's vast knowledge
of electronics, huh?

26:19.671 --> 26:22.408
Dex's head came off 'cause
that car got triggered,

26:22.443 --> 26:25.145
and, uh, this kid admitted
to being there, so...

26:25.180 --> 26:26.236
Hot lead, Wolfe.

26:26.271 --> 26:27.334
You gonna get
a camera on us?

26:27.369 --> 26:28.363
Yeah, at's that
supposed to mean?

26:28.398 --> 26:30.150
Supposed to mean I heard you
signed up to represent us.

26:30.185 --> 26:31.366
So what's next,
your own TV show?

26:31.401 --> 26:34.112
You know what, pal,
you can get one if you want.

26:34.147 --> 26:36.823
Nah, that's all right,
'll leave that to you.

26:42.287 --> 26:43.413
Don't move!

26:43.580 --> 26:45.582
Don't move!

26:47.959 --> 26:48.925
Help me.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.919
You got him, Wolfe?

26:49.954 --> 26:50.844
Help me.
I got him!

26:50.879 --> 26:53.340
I'll go get
a fire extinguisher.

26:57.177 --> 26:59.596
What are you running from,
Evan? I can't breathe.

26:59.631 --> 27:02.015
You probably just cracked
your rib. Just lie still.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.016
I think...

27:08.355 --> 27:10.815
I think someone's
trying to kill me.

27:26.748 --> 27:29.042
Wow. What just happened here?

27:30.919 --> 27:32.128
You smell that?

27:35.382 --> 27:37.300
Yeah, that isn't gasoline,
is it?

27:37.335 --> 27:38.475
No, it's jet fuel.

27:38.510 --> 27:41.888
Burns 200 degrees hotter,
cooked this car.

27:55.402 --> 27:58.822
Can't exactly get jet fuel
at a gas station.

28:00.949 --> 28:02.499
Well, it couldn't
be stolen, could it?

28:02.534 --> 28:07.163
Nah, nah, airports, refineries-
they guard their supplies 24-7.

28:07.198 --> 28:09.708
Would have made big news.

28:12.836 --> 28:15.422
Maybe they got it
from underground.

28:16.339 --> 28:18.091
What are you thinking?

28:18.126 --> 28:19.808
I read this article.

28:19.843 --> 28:22.387
Refineries deliver
their fuel supply to airports

28:22.422 --> 28:25.098
through high-pressured
pipelines.

28:26.307 --> 28:26.481
But get this,

28:26.516 --> 28:28.810
it's five feet under the city.

28:29.519 --> 28:31.319
<i>It's six miles long
and it delivers</i>

28:31.354 --> 28:34.607
<i>the equivalent
of 1800 tanker trucks a day.</i>

28:36.568 --> 28:37.492
So the jet fuel pipeline

28:37.527 --> 28:39.446
runs underneath all
these subdivisions?

28:39.481 --> 28:41.246
Yeah, it's underneath
everything.

28:41.281 --> 28:43.074
You think the sideshow
kids are tapping into it?

28:43.109 --> 28:44.624
I don't know. Maybe.

28:44.659 --> 28:47.579
Department of Public Works
says this half mile of the pipe

28:47.614 --> 28:49.706
has been shut down
this morning for construction,

28:49.741 --> 28:52.542
so it's a very good time
to try it.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.252
And the MiniRae will
tell us where to go?

28:54.287 --> 28:55.343
Yeah, HazMat uses it

28:55.378 --> 28:58.340
to detect
contamination leaks.

28:59.049 --> 29:00.633
This is the highest reading
I've gotten so far.

29:00.668 --> 29:02.677
It's 12 parts
per million.

29:05.638 --> 29:07.598
Excuse me, ma'am,
can we talk to you?

29:07.633 --> 29:09.524
Can I help you?
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

29:09.559 --> 29:11.353
This is Ryan Wolfe.
We're with Miami-Dade PD.

29:11.388 --> 29:12.687
Do you own this house?

29:12.722 --> 29:13.980
Yes.

29:14.147 --> 29:15.169
Can we take a look

29:15.204 --> 29:16.191
around your property?

29:16.858 --> 29:18.401
Sure.

29:22.072 --> 29:23.844
You still getting something?

29:23.879 --> 29:25.617
Yeah, it's off
the charts.

29:26.159 --> 29:27.952
What kind of construction
are you doing back here?

29:27.987 --> 29:29.544
I'm putting in a pool.

29:29.579 --> 29:31.956
Well, at least I was
until a few days ago.

29:31.991 --> 29:33.100
Who's your contractor?

29:33.135 --> 29:34.209
Dunlar Construction.

29:34.244 --> 29:35.377
Steve Dunlar?

29:35.418 --> 29:37.295
Yeah.

29:37.379 --> 29:39.881
That's the sideshow kid's dad,
isn't it?

29:40.081 --> 29:42.145
So there definitely
is a connection.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.674
He told me he broke
a water main,

29:43.709 --> 29:45.169
said he had
to talk to the city

29:45.204 --> 29:46.594
before he could
do anything.

29:46.629 --> 29:49.799
When's the, uh,ast
time you saw Mr. Dunlar?

29:49.834 --> 29:51.610
This morning.
He woke me up.

29:51.645 --> 29:52.911
Backed in a tanker truck.

29:52.946 --> 29:54.178
Made a lot of noise for 6:00

29:54.213 --> 29:55.305
in the morning.

29:55.388 --> 29:57.557
Said he was moving
the main.

30:00.310 --> 30:02.854
Do you smell that?

30:02.937 --> 30:05.940
Did he hit a gas line?

30:06.024 --> 30:07.609
It's jet fuel.

30:11.613 --> 30:13.239
He hit it on purpose.

30:13.448 --> 30:16.367
That thing on top
wasn't there before.

30:17.911 --> 30:20.163
Dunlar built his own gas pump.

30:31.549 --> 30:33.843
We're gonna need
to take those tools with us.

30:33.878 --> 30:34.726
I'll call H.

30:34.761 --> 30:38.264
I'm sure he has some
questions for Mr. Dunlar.

30:39.265 --> 30:40.940
Tapping into
an underground pipeline

30:40.975 --> 30:44.110
is destruction
of city property, Mr. Dunlar.

30:44.145 --> 30:46.856
I was breaking ground for
the woman, putting in a pool.

30:46.891 --> 30:47.947
I found a pipeline,

30:47.982 --> 30:49.407
but I never tampered
with anything.

30:49.442 --> 30:53.321
Then, explain the jet fuel
found in your son's car.

30:54.322 --> 30:56.122
I have no idea.

30:56.157 --> 30:58.952
The homeowner said
you had a tanker truck.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.578
She's a housewife.

31:01.079 --> 31:04.374
She probably doesn't even
know what one looks like.

31:04.409 --> 31:06.501
Look...

31:06.960 --> 31:08.718
...talk to my son about it.

31:08.753 --> 31:10.838
He's the one you found
with the jet fuel, right?

31:10.873 --> 31:12.257
He's the one that's
racing around

31:12.292 --> 31:13.181
with these street racers.

31:13.216 --> 31:15.266
Was he aware
of what you found?

31:15.301 --> 31:18.596
No, because I knew
he'd tell people.

31:18.638 --> 31:20.932
He'll do anything
to get in with those kids.

31:20.967 --> 31:22.684
I can't trust him.

31:25.019 --> 31:27.564
You set quite an example
for him.

31:30.858 --> 31:32.992
I'm gonna go now.

31:33.027 --> 31:36.072
'm a good contractor,
a reputable contractor,

31:36.107 --> 31:36.913
and as far as I can see,

31:36.948 --> 31:39.158
all you got on me
is suspicious behavior.

31:39.193 --> 31:41.286
Mr. Dunlar,

31:41.369 --> 31:43.121
that's going to change.

31:50.962 --> 31:51.921
Francis.

31:52.005 --> 31:53.673
Horatio.

31:53.715 --> 31:56.009
I had a chat with the
guys over at Auto Theft.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.016
And?

31:57.051 --> 32:00.263
They're saying stolen cars
are up 300% in two weeks.

32:00.298 --> 32:01.938
Toyotas,
Mazdas, Hondas.

32:01.973 --> 32:03.808
Frank, this is not
street racing.

32:03.843 --> 32:05.608
Have you called
the refinery?

32:05.643 --> 32:08.855
Yeah, control center's latest
count says they're short

32:08.890 --> 32:12.108
10,000 gallons of aviation
fuel worth 47 grand.

32:12.143 --> 32:14.110
I don't think Dunlar
would give his son up

32:14.145 --> 32:15.618
for that, do you?
No.

32:15.653 --> 32:18.448
We executed a search warrant
on his home and business.

32:18.483 --> 32:20.039
Came up nothing.

32:20.074 --> 32:22.785
It's, uh...
it's just not adding up.

32:22.820 --> 32:23.953
Not yet, Frank.

32:24.287 --> 32:25.580
Not yet.

32:32.629 --> 32:34.130
Is that everything
from the jet fuel pipeline?

32:34.165 --> 32:35.340
Yeah, straight
from the ground.

32:35.375 --> 32:37.091
Diverting pipe, wrenches.

32:37.217 --> 32:41.012
Whoever did this knew exactly
what they were doing.

32:45.558 --> 32:47.477
Well, Public Works said that
they shut down the pipeline

32:47.512 --> 32:49.938
for repairs between 5:00
and 7:30 this morning.

32:49.973 --> 32:52.774
That's the same time
as the sideshow.

32:56.903 --> 32:58.404
Wait a minute.

32:58.439 --> 32:59.906
What? What you got?

33:00.073 --> 33:01.991
Blood.

33:05.286 --> 33:06.538
Good eye.

33:07.539 --> 33:08.831
I'm starting to feel like
this murder

33:08.866 --> 33:11.125
is covering up something bigger.

33:23.152 --> 33:25.779
Did Natalia tell you about the
remote transmitter we found.

33:25.814 --> 33:27.037
Yeah, and I think
I figured out

33:27.072 --> 33:29.783
how it activated
the car's hydraulics.

33:29.818 --> 33:31.493
Dial that number.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.421
What the hell just happened?

33:42.456 --> 33:43.839
Uh, the trigger...

33:44.047 --> 33:47.217
r this car's hydraulics
was a cell phone.

33:47.551 --> 33:50.679
So the killer activated Dex's
hydraulics with a phone call.

33:50.714 --> 33:51.437
Exactly.

33:51.472 --> 33:54.016
The receiver in this
car was a circuit board

33:54.051 --> 33:55.976
from a stripped
down cell phone.

33:56.011 --> 33:57.495
When it received the signal,

33:57.530 --> 33:58.979
<i>it sent an electric current.</i>

33:59.354 --> 34:01.029
<i>In this case,
bypassed the ringer</i>

34:01.064 --> 34:03.233
<i>and was wired directly
into the car's hydraulic</i>

34:03.268 --> 34:05.152
<i>master switch.</i>

34:05.736 --> 34:07.905
Well, that would mean
that the caller's number

34:07.940 --> 34:10.032
is still in the memory chip,

34:10.072 --> 34:11.824
right?
Exactly.

34:11.867 --> 34:13.542
I'll pull up the call log.

34:13.577 --> 34:15.585
You know I would
narrow it down by time.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.081
The, uh, the murder occurred
around 6:00 a. m.

34:18.116 --> 34:20.083
I would, but I don't need to.

34:20.118 --> 34:21.502
There's only one number.

34:29.259 --> 34:31.386
Aren't you going to get it?

34:33.222 --> 34:34.786
Let it go to voice mail.

34:34.821 --> 34:36.350
I don't know the number.

34:36.385 --> 34:37.851
Oh, I think you do.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.527
No.

34:46.568 --> 34:49.655
You want my phone?
Talk to my lawyers.

34:50.112 --> 34:50.829
I did one better.

34:50.864 --> 34:53.909
I talked to a judge.
This is a warrant.

34:59.081 --> 35:01.208
Yeah, that number
you don't recognize,

35:01.243 --> 35:03.133
you called it this morning.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.024
We know your
phone call was sent

35:05.059 --> 35:06.880
the exact moment
Dex was killed.

35:08.757 --> 35:11.677
It's the phone call
that killed him.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.566
I didn't mean for it
to happen that way.

35:25.601 --> 35:27.568
I didn't want him to die.

35:27.985 --> 35:29.535
Well, I'm sure it didn't hurt.

35:29.570 --> 35:32.865
A good crash brings
millio of eyeballs.

35:35.242 --> 35:36.792
That's a fantastic business plan. What,

35:36.827 --> 35:39.705
you don't slow down at the side
of a road to see an accident?

35:39.740 --> 35:41.331
Everyone does it.

35:42.499 --> 35:44.585
Nobody even pays
attention at a speedway

35:44.620 --> 35:46.336
until there's a pileup.

35:46.371 --> 35:47.594
It's human nature.

35:47.629 --> 35:49.680
It's a human life, Ms. Roberts.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.348
And I'm sure that's
all the explanation

35:51.383 --> 35:54.887
a jury is going to need.
Get her out of here.

36:02.102 --> 36:04.313
So what do we got
from the lady's pool?

36:04.348 --> 36:05.028
The blood on the valve

36:05.063 --> 36:07.148
from the pool matches
the DNA profile

36:07.183 --> 36:09.234
of your headless victim.
Dex Gilman.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.320
What?

36:13.113 --> 36:15.407
No, that doesn't make sense.

36:15.949 --> 36:17.332
He died ten miles away.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.828
How'd his blood get on the pipe?

36:20.412 --> 36:23.338
The blood would have to be wet
to transfer.

36:23.373 --> 36:27.961
There was a kid who jumped in
the car with him- Luke Baylor.

36:46.355 --> 36:48.544
Guys, I didn't kill Dex.

36:48.579 --> 36:50.616
That's not why
you're here.

36:50.651 --> 36:52.653
How did you know
Mr. Dunlar?

36:52.688 --> 36:53.421
I didn't know him.

36:53.456 --> 36:54.119
I knew his kid.

36:54.154 --> 36:55.989
Drove him home a couple times.

36:56.024 --> 36:57.825
How do you explain the peline?

36:59.785 --> 37:00.751
Pipeline?

37:00.786 --> 37:02.120
Yeah, the pipeline
that's missing

37:02.155 --> 37:04.164
10,000 gallons
of jet fuel.

37:04.199 --> 37:05.036
The pipeline

37:05.071 --> 37:05.839
had blood on it.

37:05.874 --> 37:08.335
Which means you're connected
to Steve Dunlar

37:08.370 --> 37:10.838
and you two work together.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.608
I'm not saying another word.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.187
Not until I have a lawyer
in here with me.

37:27.222 --> 37:28.772
Frank, call Customs,

37:28.856 --> 37:31.775
cargo manifest for all
departing flights please.

37:31.810 --> 37:32.985
Will do.

37:34.778 --> 37:38.407
What do you need $47,000
worth of jet fuel for?

37:38.448 --> 37:40.742
Are you a world traveler, Luke?

37:42.077 --> 37:43.252
Is that a crime?

37:43.287 --> 37:46.790
No, but traveling
with stolen cars is.

37:46.957 --> 37:50.586
I'll be out on bail before
he dials his first phone call.

37:50.621 --> 37:53.422
Well, I guess the race is on.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.178
Mr. Wolfe, you were looking
for me? Yeah, two things.

37:59.213 --> 38:00.853
Tripp sent the
air cargo manifests.

38:00.888 --> 38:03.348
There are 21 planes scheduled
for departure today.

38:03.383 --> 38:04.731
What kind of cargo?

38:04.766 --> 38:06.233
Uh, Express mail, produce,

38:06.268 --> 38:08.770
construction equipment,
seafood... Wait a second.

38:08.805 --> 38:11.482
Construction equipment
shipping from where?

38:11.517 --> 38:12.948
Risedale Airstrip.

38:12.983 --> 38:14.950
Private airstrip,
private jet.

38:14.985 --> 38:17.863
Yeah, the second thing,
Luke Baylor made bail.

38:17.898 --> 38:19.740
I'll be at the airstrip.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.881
Come on, man, open it up.

38:45.015 --> 38:47.518
I'm out. Time to get paid.

38:47.601 --> 38:48.936
Nice.

39:04.868 --> 39:06.286
You made bail pretty fast.

39:06.321 --> 39:08.413
Who put the money up?

39:08.455 --> 39:10.645
What can I say? I told you
I was going to get out.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.835
You've got quite
a collection here, Luke.

39:12.870 --> 39:15.003
Is this the last car?

39:17.381 --> 39:18.861
It's a business.

39:18.896 --> 39:20.307
We fix cars.

39:20.342 --> 39:23.137
You fix up stolen cars, Luke.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.642
Your fleet here
looks like cargo.

39:33.355 --> 39:35.107
Mr. Dunlar came to me.

39:35.142 --> 39:36.859
He knew I boosted cars.

39:37.651 --> 39:39.486
Later.

39:39.521 --> 39:41.321
Hey.

39:41.530 --> 39:43.699
You Baylor?

39:44.158 --> 39:48.579
Well, if what I hear is true,
I might have a job for you.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.539
Said he would get me five thou
for every car.

39:50.574 --> 39:53.375
So I deliver 'em here,
and I walk.

39:53.834 --> 39:55.502
The restThs his deal.

39:56.753 --> 39:59.089
Where's Steve Dunlar right now?

40:00.424 --> 40:03.385
Frank, I think I kno

40:13.187 --> 40:17.566
Look, I don't care,
just get it done.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.914
Almost,
Steve. Almost.

40:25.949 --> 40:27.367
Dunlar, you planning
on going somewhere

40:27.402 --> 40:29.077
with these stolen cars?

40:31.455 --> 40:33.957
I got paperwork back
everything you see here.

40:33.992 --> 40:35.841
Luke Baylor's
ready to bust in song

40:35.876 --> 40:38.170
about every gallon you stole
from the pipeline.

40:38.205 --> 40:39.219
You're trying to leave

40:39.254 --> 40:43.050
while your kid is lying
in a hospital bed alone.?

40:46.053 --> 40:49.473
Could've filled this plane
ten times over my kid doesn't

40:49.508 --> 40:51.475
<i>screw around with the fuel.</i>

40:56.855 --> 41:00.359
He didn't know you were
smuggling jet fuel, did he?

41:00.394 --> 41:01.950
You used him

41:01.985 --> 41:04.530
You called 911 pretending
you were concerned about him.

41:04.565 --> 41:05.537
All you cared about

41:05.572 --> 41:08.075
was diverting the police
away from you.

41:08.110 --> 41:08.540
Luke offers up

41:08.575 --> 41:10.417
free cars,
you truck in free fuel.

41:10.452 --> 41:12.454
Did you make a deal
on this plane, too?

41:12.489 --> 41:14.181
Look, this was my shot.

41:14.216 --> 41:15.874
Nobody got hurt here.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.877
You know what they'll pay
for these cars in Venezuela?

41:18.912 --> 41:21.129
Almost three times the sticker.

41:21.171 --> 41:23.173
Now your son's an orphan.

41:23.208 --> 41:25.175
What's the price tag on that?

41:30.889 --> 41:32.815
Evan's a big boy.

41:32.850 --> 41:34.399
He'll learn to forgive.

41:34.434 --> 41:39.231
And hopefully...
hopefully forget.
