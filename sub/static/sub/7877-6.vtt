WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.568
(upbeat March plays)

00:02.636 --> 00:05.438
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:05.506 --> 00:09.342
¶ I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:09.409 --> 00:12.278
¶ the sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

00:12.346 --> 00:15.982
¶ and he's shining a salute
to the american race ¶

00:18.552 --> 00:22.054
¶ oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

00:22.122 --> 00:24.223
¶ good morning, usa. ¶

00:24.291 --> 00:27.093
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:27.160 --> 00:29.962
<font color="#ffff00">And toyota. Moving forward.</font>

00:31.331 --> 00:32.665
(brakes squeal)

00:32.732 --> 00:36.469
Klaus, I brought you a present
from the cia lab.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.972
A fish with a human brain,
just like me?

00:40.040 --> 00:44.610
¶ at last... ¶

00:44.678 --> 00:46.212
No, it's just a regular fish.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.048
They took its retinas out for
an eye-scanning experiment.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.017
I brought the little blind guy
home to keep you company.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.223
Well, enjoy.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.025
Hey there, beautiful.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.993
Bring that body over here.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.361
Mm...
(slapping loudly)

01:02.429 --> 01:04.363
Stan, my fanny!

01:04.431 --> 01:06.098
¶ give me some of that
franny fanny ¶

01:06.166 --> 01:08.100
¶ give me some of
that franny fanny ¶

01:08.168 --> 01:10.469
¶ pump it up!
Pump it up! Pump it up! ¶

01:10.537 --> 01:12.238
Both: ¶ give me some of that
franny fanny! ¶

01:12.306 --> 01:14.440
¶ give me some of that
franny fanny! Give me... ¶

01:14.508 --> 01:16.075
All right, enough of that.
It's clearly all chorus

01:16.143 --> 01:17.476
And I won't
be a part of it.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.445
You know, you've been getting
that franny fanny

01:19.513 --> 01:21.681
For almost 20 years.
What, now?

01:21.748 --> 01:25.351
You do remember our 20th wedding
anniversary's coming up, right?

01:25.419 --> 01:26.619
Of course.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.221
That's why I've planned
to, uh... To...

01:29.289 --> 01:32.692
Have a magical ceremony
to renew your vows.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.726
Roger, that's
a terrible...

01:33.794 --> 01:35.127
(smooching)

01:35.195 --> 01:38.831
Oh, stan. You always take
such good care of me.

01:38.899 --> 01:42.034
Yep, I remember when stan came
to me months ago

01:42.102 --> 01:43.302
And asked me
to plan the whole thing.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.739
Right, stan?

01:46.807 --> 01:47.940
Yes.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.576
Great. Just cut me
that check for $6,800,

01:50.644 --> 01:51.777
The budget
we agreed upon,

01:51.845 --> 01:53.079
And I'll get started.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.847
$6,800?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.415
Oh, stan.

01:56.483 --> 01:59.685
I'm so lucky to be married
to such a good provider.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.222
Just make it out
to jeannie gold weddings.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.790
Who's that?
Jeannie gold,

02:04.858 --> 02:06.926
Wedding planner.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.961
This is my emergency
wedding kit.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.330
Everything you need
for last-minute snafus--

02:11.398 --> 02:14.066
Needle and thread,
band-aids for sore heels,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.469
Fake hymens for those
not-so-well-behaved

02:16.536 --> 02:17.970
Middle eastern brides.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.905
These beauties are packed
full of ox blood.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.507
Trust me, that bedroom
will look like

02:21.575 --> 02:23.909
The set of wes craven movie
the next morning.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.116
You must be the children.
Jeannie gold.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.318
I wanted to discuss the gift
you're buying your parents

02:32.386 --> 02:33.552
For their anniversary.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.687
I'm just going
to get them a card.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.856
Sign my name to it,
"forever yours, s."

02:36.923 --> 02:38.090
They'll know.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.492
You'll do better
than a card.

02:39.559 --> 02:42.128
It's their 20th.
China is the traditional gift.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.529
Leave us alone, roger.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.032
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.600
I went a little
ike turner,

02:47.668 --> 02:48.801
Caught you
on the side of the head

02:48.869 --> 02:50.102
So you can cover it
with your hair.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.537
I don't want you bruised
for the photos.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.772
That's how good I am.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.140
Now find
a meaningful gift.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.808
Disappoint me
and next time,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.476
You'll be dealing
with valik.
Who?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.578
(russian accent):
Listen to jeannie
or I cut you.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.483
<i>Roger:
Two weeks from today, francine,</i>

03:04.551 --> 03:06.552
<i>You will be here,
walking down the aisle.</i>

03:06.620 --> 03:08.888
I've recreated the menu,
the flowers...

03:08.955 --> 03:11.357
I even have a string quartet
playing the score

03:11.425 --> 03:12.558
<i>From room with a view.</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:14.360
We didn't have that
at our wedding.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.862
After your reception, when you
and stan drove away in the limo,

03:16.930 --> 03:19.098
You heard a song playing
from a third story window.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.499
You didn't know what it was,

03:20.567 --> 03:22.401
But secretly wished you had
walked down the aisle to it.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.769
How did you...

03:23.837 --> 03:25.171
I never shared
that with anyone.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.806
Last Wednesday,
when you were in the bath,

03:26.873 --> 03:28.407
I snuck up
and ethered you good.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.077
While in your twilight state,
you admitted your regret.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.511
You hummed that song for me.

03:32.579 --> 03:35.314
I had a top musicologist
beside me and he identified it.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.949
He saw me naked?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.451
Honey, please.
He's a musicologist.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.652
He sees it every day.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.320
Here's the number
of my tailor.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.621
He can let
your wedding dress out.

03:42.689 --> 03:43.889
Oh, I don't need to.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.024
It still fits.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.393
Really? Look at you.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.961
She is just beautiful.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.496
That's the reason
I married her.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.630
Well, that's not
the only reason.

03:51.698 --> 03:52.798
Yes, it is.

03:52.866 --> 03:53.999
There was nothing else?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.134
Nope.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.335
Just my appearance?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.470
That is correct.

03:57.537 --> 03:58.871
What he means is,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.973
Your beauty emanates
from within.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.508
No, I don't.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.444
You know, I'm not so sure
I want to renew vows with...

04:05.512 --> 04:07.079
Don't give up
on this, francine.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.380
There were good times.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.316
Think back.
He must have done something

04:10.383 --> 04:11.550
To show his love was true.

04:11.618 --> 04:12.785
(belches)

04:12.853 --> 04:14.086
Ignore that.
Steak-ums.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.888
Well, two weeks
before our wedding,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.357
Stan and I agreed not
to see each other.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.726
At the ceremony, when I
stepped out of the limo,

04:21.795 --> 04:25.431
He ran to me, picked me
up and swung me around

04:25.499 --> 04:29.101
And told me he never wanted
to be away from me again.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.338
But now I realize
he only loved me for my looks.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.973
What? He was joking.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.307
Stan, tell her.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.977
Oh. Y-yeah, of course.
I was joking.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.512
I love you for more
than your looks.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.813
You have no sense of humor.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.281
Good thing you're pretty.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.450
Oh, another joke.
Shut up, stan.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.684
You're too funny.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.253
Okay, here's
what we're going to do.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.622
Just like before, you won't
see each other for two weeks,

04:49.689 --> 04:52.491
Then we'll recreate your reunion
at the wedding.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.394
I'll film the whole thing
and make it an extra on the dvd

04:55.462 --> 04:57.930
Along with the musicologist
touching you in the bath.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.065
I'm kidding.
At least I think I'm kidding.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.201
I left him alone with her for
a half hour while I took a nap.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.235
What do you
say, honey?

05:05.405 --> 05:08.040
Okay, roger.
Let's do it.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.441
It's still on.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.378
I'm jeannie gold,
wedding planner extraordinaire.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.082
And a survivor.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.221
He'll see you in two weeks,
just like before.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.089
(smooching)

05:24.157 --> 05:26.592
I got to hand it to you.
You're doing a great job.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.227
Are you hitting on me?
What?

05:28.295 --> 05:29.495
This happens all the time.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.931
I will not let you
ruin your wedding.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.700
I will give you a handy jay
to keep you out of trouble.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.543
Can I help you
find something?

05:44.611 --> 05:45.711
We're looking for some china

05:45.779 --> 05:47.780
For our parents
20th anniversary gift.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.381
What do you have
for under 30 bucks?

05:49.449 --> 05:51.851
These porcelain
thimbles.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.152
We'll take them.
Them?

05:53.220 --> 05:55.921
No, it's $30 for one.

05:55.989 --> 05:59.358
Just put it in your
largest free box.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.759
I'll be paying
with a combination

06:00.827 --> 06:03.395
Of change, check, and
the value of this dance.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.930
May I?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.566
Oh, I shouldn't,
but yes.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.501
(steve humming a waltz)

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.613 --> 06:21.881
You! Idiot boy!

06:21.948 --> 06:23.349
Put some stones
on the bridal runner,

06:23.416 --> 06:24.617
So the breeze won't take it.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.019
You, distribute these bags
of rice to the guests.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.755
Our policy is not to throw
rice. It's bad for the birds.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.624
Screw the birds! Here's
what I think of the birds!

06:33.526 --> 06:35.694
(squawking)

06:35.762 --> 06:37.796
Roger, where... Aw.

06:37.864 --> 06:38.998
Where's francine?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.133
Francine is on her way
with her parents.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.535
Stan, these are my sons
alex and ron.

06:43.603 --> 06:44.803
They're in columbia film school.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.205
How is that possible?

06:46.273 --> 06:48.440
I know. I look too young
to have kids in college.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.975
No, that you have children

06:50.043 --> 06:51.677
When your persona
is totally fabricated.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.912
We are the music makers.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.780
We are the dreamers of dreams.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.582
That is an
unsatisfying answer.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.219
You kids bought the gift?

07:00.287 --> 07:05.157
Oh, from landon's.
De-lovely!

07:05.225 --> 07:07.026
You could put it
in a curio case.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.394
You could sew with it.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.330
A little mouse
could wear it for a hat.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.834
The boy is to die first.

07:15.902 --> 07:16.835
(screams)

07:16.903 --> 07:17.870
(panting)

07:17.938 --> 07:19.538
Man:
Here come the bride!

07:22.742 --> 07:23.943
What happened?

07:24.010 --> 07:25.411
Let me get that
for you, dear.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.446
Bite down on this.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.348
(whimpering)

07:30.583 --> 07:32.885
(screaming)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.086
(smooching loudly)

07:34.154 --> 07:35.688
Good as new.
Don't go into shock.

07:35.755 --> 07:36.922
Today's not about you.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.691
Okay, everyone.
Places!

07:38.758 --> 07:41.060
(string quartet playing)

07:44.698 --> 07:46.498
Mom, here she comes!

07:48.234 --> 07:50.469
I'm ready to renew our vows.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.138
(stan gasps)
alex, ronnie, cut!

07:53.206 --> 07:54.940
Mama's not making
a monster movie.

07:58.915 --> 08:00.049
What are you looking for?

08:00.116 --> 08:01.917
<i>The makeup guy from norbit.</i>

08:01.985 --> 08:05.020
Rick baker, get out here,
you talented son of a bitch.

08:05.088 --> 08:07.323
Stan, this is me.

08:07.390 --> 08:09.024
What the hell happened?

08:09.092 --> 08:11.226
I stopped doing
my beauty regimen.

08:11.294 --> 08:13.195
And started her ugly regimen.

08:13.263 --> 08:14.997
(laughing)

08:15.065 --> 08:17.099
Oh, you boys keep me young.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.101
You don't know what it
takes for me to look good.

08:19.169 --> 08:20.502
After you leave for work,

08:20.570 --> 08:23.472
<i>I do the treadmill
until I throw up.</i>

08:23.540 --> 08:25.341
<i>Then I go to my hairdresser</i>

08:25.408 --> 08:27.343
<i>Where I get my roots
touched up,</i>

08:27.410 --> 08:31.080
<i>Followed by a lunch
of iced tea and laxatives.</i>

08:31.147 --> 08:33.881
<i>Then I wax my arms, legs,
and eyebrows,</i>

08:33.950 --> 08:35.650
<i>While power lifting the couch</i>

08:35.719 --> 08:37.586
<i>To tone the fanny
you love so much.</i>

08:39.089 --> 08:40.923
(gasps)

08:40.991 --> 08:42.224
(ripping and screaming)

08:42.292 --> 08:44.827
(grunting)

08:44.894 --> 08:47.696
(footfalls approaching)

08:47.764 --> 08:49.598
(heart pounding)

08:58.508 --> 09:00.709
Ha... Lo.

09:00.777 --> 09:01.810
Hey, beautiful.

09:03.213 --> 09:05.781
And I also stopped
wearing my retainer.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.049
Why are you
doing this?

09:07.117 --> 09:10.152
Stan, we've been married
for 20 years,

09:10.220 --> 09:13.889
And all this time, you've only
appreciated me for my looks?

09:13.957 --> 09:17.059
I need you to love me
for who I am on the inside.

09:17.127 --> 09:19.028
He does.
He totally does!

09:19.095 --> 09:20.863
On with the show!
We'll meet you at the altar.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.968
Oh, man. She scared me.
You see that?

09:26.036 --> 09:27.369
I almost punched
her in the face.

09:27.437 --> 09:30.072
Stan, remember,
the first rule of any wedding

09:30.140 --> 09:32.074
Is the bride
is always beautiful.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.176
The second rule
you can read on my web site.

09:34.244 --> 09:35.978
You have to be 18
to log on.

09:36.046 --> 09:37.780
I have some sexy
barnyard stuff on there

09:37.847 --> 09:39.548
That is not for everyone.

09:39.616 --> 09:41.216
I could get in
a lot of trouble.

09:41.284 --> 09:42.384
If you do decide
to check it out,

09:42.452 --> 09:44.019
You need to clear
your history right away.

09:44.087 --> 09:45.788
You may need
to uninstall your browser.

09:45.855 --> 09:47.723
I'm telling you,
scrub that thing clean.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.591
If you think you're being
too cautious, you're not.

09:49.659 --> 09:51.794
They will take us both
to jail.

09:51.861 --> 09:54.163
("bridal chorus" plays)

09:54.230 --> 09:56.432
It's worse when
she's in motion.

09:56.499 --> 09:57.699
I can't go
through with this.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.168
I'm just going
to sneak out.

09:59.235 --> 10:01.570
I don't want to embarrass
anyone by making a scene.

10:01.638 --> 10:03.505
(slapping and crashing)

10:03.573 --> 10:05.240
(crashing, harp playing)

10:06.176 --> 10:09.111
(harp playing)

10:19.522 --> 10:22.324
Stan, can you get rid of this
fish corpse floating in my bowl?

10:22.392 --> 10:23.759
It's starting to bum me out.

10:23.827 --> 10:26.662
You ran out on
our wedding?!

10:26.729 --> 10:29.598
To be fair,
to be fair, francine,

10:29.666 --> 10:32.234
To be fair...
You're ugly.

10:32.302 --> 10:35.104
This was a test to see if
you loved me for who I am,

10:35.171 --> 10:36.705
And you failed!

10:36.773 --> 10:38.340
I wasn't in the mood
to be tested!

10:38.408 --> 10:40.209
Are you that shallow, stan?

10:40.276 --> 10:44.179
If after 20 years of marriage,
you can find nothing more

10:44.247 --> 10:46.281
To love about me than my looks,

10:46.349 --> 10:48.817
Then I don't even know
why we're married.

10:48.885 --> 10:52.754
Either you love me for who I am,
or lose me forever.

10:54.591 --> 10:56.625
Okay, okay.

10:56.693 --> 10:58.760
If it means
that much to you,

10:58.828 --> 11:00.696
I'll try to get to know
the real you.

11:00.763 --> 11:01.864
Honest?

11:01.931 --> 11:03.132
Honest.

11:03.199 --> 11:06.001
It'll be like dating
all over again.

11:06.069 --> 11:08.737
Only this time, you'll be
the one with the moustache.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.074
But, stan, wait!

11:12.142 --> 11:13.242
The fish!

11:13.309 --> 11:14.409
(sighs)

11:14.477 --> 11:16.478
Well, I guess I could
make love to it

11:16.546 --> 11:19.114
One more time before
the stench makes me vomit.

11:25.588 --> 11:27.723
This is fun, huh?

11:30.593 --> 11:31.460
There you go.

11:34.531 --> 11:37.299
There it is.

11:40.904 --> 11:43.505
Stan, an orthodox
jewish service

11:43.573 --> 11:45.641
Is a very strange
place for a date.

11:45.708 --> 11:48.377
Did you take me here so you
wouldn't have to look at me?

11:48.444 --> 11:49.378
Francine, please.

11:49.445 --> 11:50.579
The torah is out of the ark.

11:50.647 --> 11:52.247
Show some respect.

11:52.315 --> 11:55.784
<i>¶ barachu adanoi hamvoraoh
laolom va-ed. ¶</i>

11:55.852 --> 11:57.953
(stan and francine panting)

11:58.021 --> 12:00.522
I knew you could
get past my looks.

12:00.590 --> 12:01.857
(sighs)

12:01.925 --> 12:03.325
A hundred and nine.

12:03.393 --> 12:05.227
A hundred and nine what?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.231
That's it, stan!

12:09.299 --> 12:10.465
We're through!

12:12.635 --> 12:14.436
I want you out of this house!

12:14.504 --> 12:15.504
No, you don't.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.941
Whoa, whoa, francine,
be careful!

12:19.008 --> 12:20.275
Lift with your
fat ugly legs,

12:20.343 --> 12:21.376
Not your fat
ugly back.

12:26.149 --> 12:28.317
I forgot my bathroom key.

12:28.384 --> 12:29.451
So, you're here late?

12:29.519 --> 12:30.886
Yeah, I got to clean up

12:30.954 --> 12:32.721
After all those animals
you folks blinded.

12:32.789 --> 12:33.889
(squawks)

12:33.957 --> 12:35.190
Oh, looks like one got out.

12:35.258 --> 12:36.625
No, I left the
cages open.

12:36.693 --> 12:39.494
I can't afford to go
to the movies, so...

12:39.562 --> 12:41.296
This makes me laugh.

12:41.364 --> 12:42.664
I could use
a good laugh.

12:42.732 --> 12:43.999
My wife kicked me out.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.000
Ooh.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.268
Is she fine?

12:46.336 --> 12:47.636
'cause I'll give
a fine bitch a call.

12:47.704 --> 12:48.904
No, she's not fine.

12:48.972 --> 12:49.871
That's the problem.

12:49.939 --> 12:51.440
I can't stand the sight of her.

12:51.507 --> 12:52.441
But I love her.

12:52.508 --> 12:53.609
I mean, she's my wife.

12:53.676 --> 12:55.944
Well, you better
do something quick.

12:56.012 --> 12:59.848
'cause you know they miss you
at first, but that wears off.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.184
I don't know what to do.

13:02.252 --> 13:03.085
(monkey squawking)

13:05.288 --> 13:08.890
(laughing)

13:08.958 --> 13:11.860
That stupid monkey.

13:15.531 --> 13:16.531
Hello, stan.

13:16.599 --> 13:17.866
I got your message.

13:17.934 --> 13:20.002
Oh, francine, thank
you for meeting me.

13:20.069 --> 13:22.004
Look, I know I've been
acting like an ass,

13:22.071 --> 13:23.372
But I'm committed
to this.

13:23.439 --> 13:24.940
Committed to us.

13:25.008 --> 13:26.475
Oh, stan.

13:26.542 --> 13:29.278
You're meeting me
in a public, well-lit place.

13:29.345 --> 13:30.545
You're really trying.

13:30.613 --> 13:32.047
I really am.

13:32.115 --> 13:35.250
I already ordered some wine
so we can toast to our future.

13:35.318 --> 13:38.220
There's a dog
doing a handstand on the label.

13:38.288 --> 13:40.088
Stan, we can't
afford this.

13:40.156 --> 13:43.458
Nothing but the best
for my lady.

13:43.526 --> 13:45.093
Oh, I'll go
get a towel.

13:45.161 --> 13:46.962
That's okay,
I'll just use my napkin.

13:47.030 --> 13:49.197
That's better.

13:49.265 --> 13:50.999
Stan, what is
going on with you?

13:51.067 --> 13:53.602
I love you, francine, and
I didn't want to lose you,

13:53.670 --> 13:55.637
But I can't get
past your looks.

13:55.705 --> 13:59.107
So I did the only sensible thing
a man in my position would do.

13:59.175 --> 14:00.876
I had my
retinas removed.

14:00.943 --> 14:01.810
I'm completely
blind!

14:01.878 --> 14:02.778
(gasps)

14:02.845 --> 14:04.279
A toast! To us.

14:09.407 --> 14:11.808
I can't believe
what stan did.

14:11.876 --> 14:13.644
Wait!

14:15.613 --> 14:16.813
Ready.

14:16.881 --> 14:18.515
He took his
retinas out!

14:18.583 --> 14:20.017
Does this story
come with a dictionary?

14:20.084 --> 14:21.251
I don't know
what retinas are.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.252
What are you telling me?!

14:22.320 --> 14:24.187
He blinded himself.

14:24.255 --> 14:26.390
Oh. So where is
the big dope?

14:26.457 --> 14:27.958
Oh, for the
love of...

14:28.026 --> 14:31.895
So jackson's grandmother went
to law school in the '30s, okay?

14:31.963 --> 14:33.163
That is a
strong woman.

14:33.231 --> 14:35.699
Come on, stan!

14:35.767 --> 14:37.634
You are unbelievable!

14:37.702 --> 14:39.603
I did it to save our marriage.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.104
My eyes were getting me
into trouble,

14:41.172 --> 14:43.206
So I had the cia
take my retinas out.

14:43.274 --> 14:45.976
Now that I'm blind, I can
fall in love with your insides.

14:46.044 --> 14:47.778
Then I'll be able
to stomach your outside.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.280
I'll be like
joan cusack's husband.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.682
(sobbing)

14:51.749 --> 14:55.552
When grandma ling
was on her deathbed,

14:55.620 --> 14:58.121
She said,
"look into my eyes, francine,

14:58.189 --> 15:00.190
And you'll never be alone."

15:00.258 --> 15:03.860
And I did,
and it made me feel so safe!

15:03.928 --> 15:07.030
And now I can't even look
my own husband in the eyes.

15:07.098 --> 15:09.933
That's the most moving story
I've ever heard.

15:10.001 --> 15:13.036
I must have told you that
story at least 30 times.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.405
Yes, but this is
the first time I listened.

15:15.473 --> 15:16.974
I want to know
everything about you.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.475
Really?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.377
Well, I was born
September 26.

15:20.445 --> 15:21.378
You're a libra!

15:21.446 --> 15:22.379
I need to know more!

15:22.447 --> 15:23.380
Where are you from?

15:23.448 --> 15:24.715
Do you have any children?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.417
What's in this?

15:27.485 --> 15:28.485
It's fantastic!

15:28.553 --> 15:29.886
I make this all the time.

15:29.954 --> 15:33.123
I guess I never truly
tasted your cooking before.

15:33.191 --> 15:35.859
You're such an intriguing
woman, francine.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.194
Tell me
your dreams.

15:37.261 --> 15:39.029
Where do you park when
you go the airport?

15:39.097 --> 15:40.897
Parking lot c.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.869
(moaning)

15:45.937 --> 15:47.504
Oh, stan.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.540
Without your eyesight, you've
become a much better lover.

15:50.608 --> 15:52.876
I'm just so in tune
with your body.

15:52.944 --> 15:55.045
I'm gonna slap
your big round ass.

15:55.113 --> 15:56.713
Damn right you are.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.482
Ow! That's my head!

15:58.549 --> 16:00.050
Roger?! What are
you doing in here?

16:00.118 --> 16:02.486
I just came to tell you
that jeannie gold's business

16:02.553 --> 16:03.720
Is ruined because of you,

16:03.788 --> 16:06.590
And then I kind of
got caught up in the show.

16:06.658 --> 16:08.925
Well, tell jeannie she'll
get another chance.

16:08.993 --> 16:11.328
We're going to go ahead
and renew our vows.

16:11.396 --> 16:13.397
That is, if
you'll have me.

16:13.464 --> 16:15.899
Oh, stan, of course I will.

16:15.967 --> 16:18.869
It's last minute, but I can
get us the willow room.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.537
It'll take all
of my radisson points,

16:20.605 --> 16:22.072
But what am I saving them for?

16:22.140 --> 16:23.340
A man? Ha!

16:23.408 --> 16:25.042
I'm too set in my ways.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.711
<i>Alex trebek, a chamomile tea
and a chapter of little women</i>

16:27.779 --> 16:29.112
And I'm out by 8:15.

16:31.683 --> 16:33.617
Mom and dad are gonna
love this present.

16:33.685 --> 16:35.786
How much longer do we
have to sit like this?

16:35.853 --> 16:37.788
He's putting on the
finishing touches.

16:39.757 --> 16:41.491
Ooh, the muses
have taken him.

16:45.496 --> 16:48.165
He's done!

16:48.232 --> 16:50.133
Hayley:
Wow, it's beautiful.

16:50.201 --> 16:52.069
Yeah, I'm surprised
how good it is.

17:03.047 --> 17:04.580
Oh, no!

17:04.648 --> 17:06.148
The vows ceremony
is tomorrow.

17:06.217 --> 17:07.184
What are we
gonna do?!

17:07.251 --> 17:08.351
Valik's gonna kill us!

17:08.419 --> 17:09.352
(groans)

17:09.420 --> 17:10.987
My scar's burning.

17:11.055 --> 17:12.556
He's thinking
of me!

17:15.492 --> 17:17.027
(chuckles)
what?

17:17.095 --> 17:19.128
I notice you let out
little farts all the time.

17:19.196 --> 17:21.098
It's cute. They don't
even smell that bad.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.898
This one does,
but usually they don't.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.736
I can't wait to renew
our vows tomorrow.

17:25.803 --> 17:28.772
In some strange
way, your blindness

17:28.840 --> 17:31.441
Is the best thing that
has ever happened to us.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.143
(moans)

17:33.211 --> 17:34.644
You're right.

17:34.712 --> 17:37.647
My plan was to get it reversed,
but being blind is great.

17:37.715 --> 17:39.616
It's given
our relationship depth.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.018
Now you won't have to spend
all day making yourself pretty.

17:42.086 --> 17:44.187
You can take care of me
full-time.
What?

17:44.255 --> 17:45.722
Except, of course,
when you're at work.

17:45.790 --> 17:46.757
Work?

17:46.824 --> 17:48.525
I'm a blind bastard,
francine.

17:48.593 --> 17:50.227
You'll be providing
for the family now.

17:50.294 --> 17:51.661
I can't be
a provider.

17:51.729 --> 17:52.963
Sure you can.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.766
Let's see, what kind of job
can an ugly person do?

17:55.833 --> 17:58.635
Run the equipment
sign-out room at a ymca.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.804
You could wrap flowers
in a supermarket.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.405
Manage a jo-ann fabrics.

18:02.473 --> 18:04.441
Think about it, francine:
Management.

18:04.509 --> 18:07.277
You're not filipino,
so you can't be a nurse.

18:10.448 --> 18:12.449
(organ playing softly)

18:12.517 --> 18:13.884
I'm sure she's
on her way.

18:13.951 --> 18:16.219
She's only three
hours late.

18:16.287 --> 18:17.888
Padre, stop
looking so tense.

18:17.955 --> 18:19.089
You're stressing
everyone out.

18:19.157 --> 18:20.657
You need to relax.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.227
You bitch!

18:24.295 --> 18:25.929
You left me and
stan at the altar!

18:25.997 --> 18:27.564
You made
fools of us!

18:27.632 --> 18:29.065
You are going to
apologize to me,

18:29.133 --> 18:30.200
And you're going
to apologize to...

18:31.669 --> 18:32.636
Oh, for the love of...

18:34.806 --> 18:37.474
Come on, stan!

18:38.810 --> 18:39.910
Francine!

18:39.977 --> 18:41.411
Are you in
the room?

18:41.479 --> 18:43.280
I smell chicken fingers, so
I know you're in the room.

18:43.347 --> 18:45.215
I'm here.

18:45.283 --> 18:48.218
I can't believe
you didn't show.

18:48.286 --> 18:50.554
You know why
I didn't show?

18:50.621 --> 18:53.223
I didn't get married
to take care of somebody!

18:53.291 --> 18:55.792
I got married
to be taken care of!

18:55.860 --> 18:57.060
I'm not the
bad guy here.

18:57.128 --> 18:58.228
You're the one
who doesn't want

18:58.296 --> 18:59.529
To be with me
because I'm blind.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.398
I don't want
to be a provider.

19:01.465 --> 19:03.099
And I don't want
an ugly wife.

19:03.167 --> 19:06.770
Well, I-I guess I'm just
as shallow as you are.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.672
I guess you are.

19:08.739 --> 19:10.974
So what if we got married
for surface reasons?

19:11.042 --> 19:12.676
It works.
You're right.

19:12.743 --> 19:14.377
Why fix something
that's not broken?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.745
Absolutely.

19:15.813 --> 19:18.215
We may be shallow,
but our love is deep.

19:20.017 --> 19:21.351
(both moan)

19:21.419 --> 19:23.153
The vows are back on.

19:23.221 --> 19:25.655
Okay, we blew the budget on
the first two ceremonies.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.023
Not sure how,

19:27.091 --> 19:29.860
But jeannie gold is going
to make it spectacular!

19:31.562 --> 19:32.796
¶ ¶

19:32.864 --> 19:35.899
¶ ¶

19:38.169 --> 19:40.136
I promise, when
you start to sag,

19:40.204 --> 19:42.672
To subject you to
risky elective surgery.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.341
And I promise
to be with you

19:44.408 --> 19:46.910
Only if you make money
and stay healthy.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.378
Alzheimer's runs
in my family.

19:48.446 --> 19:50.780
You'll be
dealing with that solo.

19:50.848 --> 19:52.148
I had no
budget left.

19:52.216 --> 19:54.150
I went to the party store
and bought the leftover

19:54.218 --> 19:56.386
Thanksgiving decorations
from the half-price bin.

19:56.454 --> 19:57.988
I think you did
a great job, mom.

19:58.055 --> 20:00.123
I did when I made you.

20:00.191 --> 20:03.727
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my honor to present to you

20:03.794 --> 20:05.095
Once again
as husband and wife...

20:05.162 --> 20:06.997
Man: Could we get
more garlic bread?

20:07.064 --> 20:10.367
...Stan and
francine smith!

20:10.434 --> 20:13.470
Move it along. We only have
the place for another half hour.

20:13.537 --> 20:15.038
Who wants orange?

20:15.106 --> 20:16.006
Root beer?

20:16.073 --> 20:17.474
I got two light beers.

20:17.541 --> 20:19.809
They were on the dashboard
of my car for a long time.

20:19.877 --> 20:21.077
They are hot to the touch.

20:21.145 --> 20:22.112
Anybody?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.580
They do not have dessert here,

20:23.648 --> 20:25.215
But I brought a bag
of chips ahoy.

20:25.283 --> 20:27.617
I was keeping it in a cooler
so the chocolate chips

20:27.685 --> 20:29.719
Wouldn't melt, but the water
soaked through the bag.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.655
Long story short,
some of the cookies are wet.

20:31.722 --> 20:33.590
I'll spread them out
over here in the sun.

20:33.658 --> 20:35.225
Help yourselves.
Everyone having a good time?

20:35.293 --> 20:36.293
Best wedding ever, right?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
I'm ruined.

20:37.428 --> 20:40.497
¶ ¶

20:40.564 --> 20:42.165
Have you seen
steve and hayley?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.336
(squawks)

20:49.540 --> 20:52.342
That maniac valik
will never find us here.
