01:10.479 --> 01:14.487
Hush little baby,
don't say a word.

01:15.285 --> 01:18.759
Daddy's gonna get you
a mockingbird.

01:20.257 --> 01:23.330
But if that mockingbird
don't sing.

01:23.861 --> 01:27.168
Well, Daddy's gonna get you
a diamond ring.

01:28.032 --> 01:31.105
But if that diamond ring
turns brass.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.040
Daddy's gonna...

01:56.699 --> 01:58.569
Third time in a month.

01:58.635 --> 02:00.472
Could mean we're being tracked.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.307
Somebody knows we're here.

02:02.373 --> 02:05.212
How can you say that?
Nobody knows we're here.

02:05.275 --> 02:07.313
Why don't you just give up?

02:08.078 --> 02:09.714
I made a promise.

02:12.551 --> 02:13.853
Oh, no.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.723
Wait! Where you going?

02:17.057 --> 02:18.459
Where you...

02:18.792 --> 02:20.262
You're crazy.

02:46.824 --> 02:48.727
Dear Lily Catherine.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.733
Well, it's another
beautiful day in Paradise.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.433
I woke up this morning

02:53.498 --> 02:56.537
and thought about taking you
up to the top of the Koolaus,

02:56.601 --> 02:59.674
where you can see the ocean
everywhere you look.

03:00.072 --> 03:03.613
I wonder if you can see the
ocean from where you are now.

03:03.744 --> 03:05.848
I wonder where you are now.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.383
And I guess
if you could read this,

03:08.449 --> 03:11.789
you would wonder why I've
taken to writing you letters.

03:11.853 --> 03:13.623
Letters I have no idea
where to send

03:13.688 --> 03:17.663
since the Navy gave you and your
mother new names and a new life.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.164
I don't really know why myself,

03:21.230 --> 03:26.207
except writing them somehow makes
me feel a little closer to you.

03:27.304 --> 03:30.644
Somehow I know
I will see you again.

03:32.076 --> 03:34.781
I hope you and your mama
are well and happy.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.850
I think of you every day.

03:38.984 --> 03:41.055
Ah, there you are, Magnum.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.023
Higgins.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.560
What are you... No.

03:46.326 --> 03:49.031
Don't bother.
I don't even want to know.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.732
I see you've forgotten
your appointment.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.270
No, I haven't forgotten my
appointment with my lawyer.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.776
I was simply making out my
grocery list while I waited.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.145
Your grocery list?

04:02.678 --> 04:04.415
That's right. I see.

04:05.348 --> 04:06.783
Well, you're in luck, Magnum.

04:06.849 --> 04:08.853
As it happens,
I'm on my way to market.

04:08.919 --> 04:10.889
Oh, you're doing
the marketing now?

04:10.954 --> 04:14.394
Yes. And I'll be happy to collect
whatever items you need.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.561
Well, that's great!

04:15.627 --> 04:19.368
But I haven't quite finished with it, yet.
So, thanks anyway.

04:19.564 --> 04:22.336
Magnum, why do you have
this constant,

04:22.400 --> 04:24.571
adolescent need for subterfuge?

04:24.637 --> 04:26.173
What do you mean?

04:26.238 --> 04:27.239
It's quite apparent

04:27.306 --> 04:29.544
that you've forgotten your
appointment with Mr. Rankin.

04:29.609 --> 04:32.648
It's equally apparent that you weren't
working on your grocery list.

04:32.712 --> 04:34.883
Yet, rather than
simply owning up to it,

04:34.949 --> 04:38.323
you steadfastly insist on something
that is clearly an outright lie.

04:38.386 --> 04:39.421
That's not true.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.823
When you're caught, you
become even more adamant,

04:40.889 --> 04:42.492
as if, through your insistence,

04:42.558 --> 04:43.960
you can make truth of the lie.

04:44.026 --> 04:46.331
I do not! Then show me the list.

04:46.528 --> 04:51.004
Higgins, you are absolutely and
unequivocally wrong about this.

04:51.301 --> 04:53.973
One list is
worth a thousand words.

04:57.142 --> 04:58.879
All right, Higgins.

04:59.210 --> 05:01.715
You want to see
what I'm working on?

05:02.547 --> 05:06.321
It's really that important
for you to be proven right?

05:12.960 --> 05:14.596
"Frozen pizza, potato chips,."

05:14.661 --> 05:17.400
"Old DÃ¼sseldorf
in a long neck, popcorn."

05:17.898 --> 05:19.434
This is a grocery list.

05:19.499 --> 05:22.939
And I really appreciate your
offering to pick those things up.

05:23.004 --> 05:25.342
"Toaster waffles,
Fig Newtons..."

05:26.374 --> 05:29.179
Magnum, there are
two pages of items here.

05:30.113 --> 05:32.484
Well, I'd love to stay and
chat with you, Higgins.

05:32.548 --> 05:35.721
But I'm late for my appointment
with my barrister.

05:40.958 --> 05:45.367
"Cheerios, Kix, Raisinets,."

05:46.698 --> 05:48.167
"Jujyfruits..."

05:54.641 --> 05:57.646
Sorry I'm late. I just
kinda lost track of time.

05:57.710 --> 06:01.418
No problem. I see you've been
going over a few memories here.

06:01.482 --> 06:04.989
Seems like you're always going
to trial with the Ki brothers.

06:05.053 --> 06:06.823
Can I get you
something to drink?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.291
Yeah, what've you got?

06:08.356 --> 06:10.693
Grapefruit juice, grapefruit
juice and grapefruit juice.

06:10.759 --> 06:11.928
That's all right, I'll pass.

06:11.994 --> 06:14.499
I meant to get to
the store today, but...

06:14.563 --> 06:16.266
I think I've found something,

06:16.333 --> 06:19.372
but I'm not sure
exactly what it is.

06:20.637 --> 06:23.175
The men Quang Ki hired to
kill you in the warehouse...

06:23.241 --> 06:26.982
Well, eyewitnesses
have come forward saying

06:27.045 --> 06:30.385
they saw two of them pursuing
a woman up the Old Pali Road.

06:30.448 --> 06:32.218
Yeah, you told me that
on the phone.

06:32.284 --> 06:35.858
But what I didn't tell you was that
they got the license plate of the car.

06:35.921 --> 06:38.761
It was an Audi
registered to Robin Masters.

06:39.426 --> 06:40.895
Nobody seems to
be able to explain that.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.131
So I did a little research,
and discovered that

06:43.197 --> 06:45.835
there was a woman involved in the
Colonel Ki shooting as well.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.903
What's your point, Rankin?

06:47.968 --> 06:50.674
Well, if there is a woman
somewhere who can testify...

06:50.739 --> 06:52.108
There isn't.

06:53.276 --> 06:56.448
You know, we don't have
a hell of a lot to go on.

06:56.846 --> 06:58.983
I need everything I can get.

07:00.650 --> 07:01.752
If...

07:04.822 --> 07:08.329
if there was a woman
driving up the Old Pali,

07:08.393 --> 07:09.633
she had nothing to do with this.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.898
Quang Ki tried to kill me
because I killed his brother.

07:11.963 --> 07:13.399
It's that simple.

07:13.465 --> 07:14.700
Revenge?

07:16.035 --> 07:17.137
You think
the jury's gonna believe

07:17.203 --> 07:19.123
that he went through all
this trouble for revenge?

07:19.138 --> 07:21.443
You ever been to Southeast Asia?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.179
Revenge is part of
their way of life.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.549
It's tied to honor and dignity.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.086
Quang Ki tried to kill me
for revenge, that's all.

07:30.151 --> 07:31.721
But that's your word
against his.

07:31.786 --> 07:33.054
And T.C' s.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.892
Well, all T.C. can say is that
he saw you standing over Ki

07:35.958 --> 07:38.530
with a two by four,
ready to brain him.

07:38.594 --> 07:42.668
But if there's someone else who can
testify that he had a motive...

07:44.968 --> 07:47.106
There's nothing else
I can tell you.

07:47.171 --> 07:48.239
Dammit!

07:48.538 --> 07:50.174
Will you help me?

07:51.075 --> 07:53.113
I wanna put this guy away.

07:55.313 --> 07:59.822
You know, I could ask you these questions
on the stand tomorrow, under oath.

08:06.226 --> 08:07.595
I gotta go.

08:08.162 --> 08:11.369
I'm late for a meeting
in Judge Haruda's chambers.

08:14.735 --> 08:16.973
Okay, we'll go with
your testimony

08:17.038 --> 08:20.111
and hope to God it's enough
to get a conviction.

08:21.277 --> 08:24.651
Because I wanna put this man
behind bars for a long, long time.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.948
So do I.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.188
At which time we will
prove that the defendant

08:30.253 --> 08:34.528
hired three known contract
killers to murder Thomas Magnum.

08:36.059 --> 08:39.433
The defendant,
with malice and forethought,

08:40.365 --> 08:44.106
plotted against his victim as
he lay dying in a hospital room

08:44.169 --> 08:46.440
and then lured him back
to the same warehouse

08:46.506 --> 08:49.980
where he attempted to kill him
with an automatic weapon.

08:50.311 --> 08:53.550
All of this was calculated
and carried out

08:54.215 --> 08:56.653
for no other reason
than vengeance.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.687
Although Thomas Magnum
was acquitted

08:58.752 --> 09:01.658
in the self-defense shooting
of Van Luan Ki.

09:02.557 --> 09:07.701
Quang Ki would not rest until he
saw his brother's death avenged.

09:08.931 --> 09:11.503
And so, we will prove motive,

09:11.834 --> 09:13.705
weapon, location,

09:15.305 --> 09:17.843
and then, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

09:17.908 --> 09:21.883
the intended victim's own testimony
will tell you in vivid detail

09:22.814 --> 09:25.887
how close Quang Ki came
to fulfilling his goal.

09:27.554 --> 09:29.691
Having heard that testimony,

09:29.889 --> 09:33.596
I have no doubt that you
will return a verdict

09:34.694 --> 09:36.029
of guilty.

09:37.797 --> 09:39.133
Thank you.

09:40.868 --> 09:44.175
Very well. Is the state ready
with its first witness?

09:44.839 --> 09:46.042
Yes, we are, Your Honor.

09:46.108 --> 09:47.410
May it please the court.

09:47.476 --> 09:48.879
Yes, Counselor?

09:48.944 --> 09:51.215
Your Honor, the defense moves
to dismiss the indictment

09:51.281 --> 09:53.218
on the grounds
that the case as outlined

09:53.283 --> 09:56.823
provides insufficient evidence to
cover all elements of the offense.

09:56.886 --> 09:58.589
What is this?

09:58.655 --> 10:01.093
A standard motion.
It'll be denied.

10:02.294 --> 10:06.035
The court can find
no substantial evidence,

10:06.097 --> 10:07.700
beyond circumstantial,

10:07.766 --> 10:10.906
submitted by the prosecution
to support their case.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.940
Therefore I have no alternative

10:13.005 --> 10:15.310
but to grant the defense motion.

10:15.975 --> 10:17.511
Case dismissed.

10:34.211 --> 10:35.279
What the hell's going on?

10:35.334 --> 10:36.749
I don't know.

10:36.815 --> 10:38.117
How could he dismiss
the case like that?

10:38.182 --> 10:39.218
I don't know!

10:49.362 --> 10:52.702
DBO 256. The license number.

10:52.766 --> 10:53.767
Thomas, what's this all about?

10:53.834 --> 10:55.772
I've never seen such a travesty.

10:55.837 --> 10:57.440
T.C. has the license number.
Could you...

10:57.505 --> 10:58.640
Consider it done.

10:58.707 --> 11:01.112
Thanks. I'll check
with you later.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.983
Rankin!

11:07.383 --> 11:08.551
Some surprise, huh?

11:08.618 --> 11:09.619
Was it?

11:09.686 --> 11:11.166
I mean, it's customary
for the defense

11:11.188 --> 11:12.657
to make a summary move
for dismissal,

11:12.723 --> 11:15.061
but it's a token, nobody
expects it to happen.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.160
Then why did it?

11:16.226 --> 11:17.362
I don't know.
I'm not a mind reader.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.665
You wanna know why Judge Haruda
dismissed the case, ask him.

11:19.731 --> 11:21.267
I'm asking you!

11:21.734 --> 11:22.969
Did you know
about this yesterday?

11:23.035 --> 11:24.438
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

11:24.503 --> 11:25.671
Why did you even
come to the house?

11:25.738 --> 11:28.176
You wouldn't help me! I told you I
didn't have a strong enough case.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.376
Don't give me that, Rankin.

11:29.442 --> 11:30.811
Something else happened.
Magnum...

11:30.877 --> 11:32.915
Why else would you pull
a disappearing act?

11:32.980 --> 11:34.817
I was caught with my pants down.

11:34.882 --> 11:37.187
That's not something I'd like
to share with the press.

11:37.251 --> 11:38.921
Now if you don't mind, I'd
like to get out of here

11:38.987 --> 11:43.329
so I can figure out what I'm gonna say
to them when they catch up to me.

11:43.592 --> 11:45.762
Go home, Magnum. It's over.

11:46.863 --> 11:48.332
No, it's not.

11:55.539 --> 11:57.041
That's ridiculous, Thomas.

11:57.106 --> 11:58.642
If anything like that
was going on,

11:58.709 --> 12:01.014
I would have heard something,
and I haven't. Not a thing.

12:01.079 --> 12:02.515
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

12:02.580 --> 12:05.519
Don't you think there would've been
some rumblings about Quang Ki?

12:05.583 --> 12:07.721
Unless somebody was trying
to keep it real quiet.

12:07.787 --> 12:10.659
Thomas, you see ghosts where
there aren't even shadows.

12:10.723 --> 12:12.526
Thank you, Colonel...

12:14.193 --> 12:17.300
Commander Poole, will you escort
Miss Rockwell to the front desk?

12:17.364 --> 12:18.632
Yes, sir.

12:24.739 --> 12:27.846
You know, your style
leaves a lot to be desired.

12:28.377 --> 12:30.881
What brings you barging
into my office this time?

12:30.947 --> 12:32.549
A mutual friend.

12:33.282 --> 12:36.021
Someone who
I haven't seen in awhile.

12:36.319 --> 12:38.690
At least not
when she could see me.

12:38.756 --> 12:40.559
But I think you have.

12:41.058 --> 12:42.428
I'm sure you know
who I'm talking about.

12:42.493 --> 12:45.900
It's a beautiful woman with dangerous
information about her country.

12:45.964 --> 12:47.099
Someone you helped relocate,

12:47.164 --> 12:49.369
trying to convince her
Vietnamese enemies she was dead.

12:49.434 --> 12:50.536
What's your point, Magnum?

12:50.602 --> 12:51.637
Where's Michelle?

12:51.703 --> 12:54.810
You know I can't tell you that.
For her own good.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.945
Yeah, I bought that too, Buck.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.512
Till you let Quang Ki loose.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.881
What are you talking about?

12:59.947 --> 13:03.387
Quang Ki's in jail. On trial
for your attempted murder.

13:08.223 --> 13:10.861
You're good, Buck.
You're very good.

13:10.926 --> 13:13.731
You have this amazing
talent for lying,

13:14.964 --> 13:17.135
and it's something
that can't be taught.

13:17.199 --> 13:19.504
You either have it or you don't.

13:20.236 --> 13:21.839
But, see, I have

13:22.339 --> 13:25.913
this built-in lie detector
that sees right through you.

13:25.977 --> 13:29.417
Now, you know as well as I do
that case was dismissed.

13:30.281 --> 13:33.821
I wanna know where Michelle is
before Quang Ki finds her.

13:33.886 --> 13:36.324
You know, this is
getting very old.

13:37.322 --> 13:41.063
Every time you conjure up some
cockamamie story about Michelle,

13:41.128 --> 13:42.830
you COMe charging into my office

13:42.897 --> 13:45.201
to accuse me of some wrongdoing.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.974
Your ex-wife has a new life,
a new identity.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.411
She even chose a new marriage.

13:56.244 --> 13:58.482
She's safe. We've seen to that.

13:58.548 --> 14:00.585
Safe? With Quang Ki
on the loose?

14:00.650 --> 14:02.320
He's already tried
to kill her once.

14:02.385 --> 14:06.961
As a matter of fact, I even took extra
precautions when Quang Ki came to trial,

14:07.024 --> 14:10.197
just to make sure nobody
could possibly trace her.

14:12.030 --> 14:14.970
If anything happens
to Michelle or Lily...

14:15.433 --> 14:17.069
What are you gonna do?

14:17.136 --> 14:18.371
Kill me?

14:34.522 --> 14:35.725
Get any answers?

14:35.791 --> 14:38.496
No. But I think I got him moving.
Maggie,

14:41.798 --> 14:44.068
I have a favor to ask you.
It's a big one.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.736
And it could get you
into a lot of trouble,

14:45.802 --> 14:48.641
so don't say anything
till you hear me out.

14:51.909 --> 14:56.018
And if that cart and bull
turn over.

14:57.082 --> 15:00.155
Daddy's gonna get you
a dog named Rover.

15:01.386 --> 15:04.593
And if that dog named Rover
fall down.

15:06.459 --> 15:09.364
You'll still be
the cutest little baby...

15:16.104 --> 15:18.309
And if that dog named Rover
fall down.

15:19.607 --> 15:22.379
You'll still be
the sweetest little baby...

15:22.845 --> 15:24.113
Hush little baby...

15:24.179 --> 15:28.354
I wish I could tell you the world
is a safe and loving place.

15:28.517 --> 15:32.125
That the boogeyman is only a
figment of your imagination

15:32.189 --> 15:36.398
and that I could protect you from
anything bad that comes your way.

15:36.460 --> 15:40.034
I wish I could tell you that
nobody could ever hurt you,

15:40.098 --> 15:41.601
but that wouldn't be the truth.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.174
Magnum, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

15:48.141 --> 15:49.176
No.

15:51.178 --> 15:52.981
Any news on Quang Ki?

15:54.048 --> 15:55.083
No.

15:56.784 --> 15:57.785
It's been nearly...

15:57.851 --> 15:59.287
Forty-three hours.

15:59.354 --> 16:00.522
Quite.

16:02.557 --> 16:05.897
It's infuriating, isn't it?

16:06.929 --> 16:11.204
How life goes relentlessly on
even in times like these.

16:12.836 --> 16:14.305
The mail just arrived.

16:14.371 --> 16:17.277
The usual assortment
of bills, occupant only,

16:18.142 --> 16:19.377
and this,

16:20.011 --> 16:23.117
some educational material.
It came by messenger.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.585
Thanks, Higgins.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.759
If there's anything
I can do to help...

16:35.528 --> 16:37.198
I'll let you know.

16:43.205 --> 16:47.514
I know you and Colonel Greene
don't exactly see eye to eye,

16:50.079 --> 16:54.353
but I'm sure even you would agree
that he is a consummate professional.

16:54.584 --> 16:55.786
What I mean to say is,

16:55.852 --> 16:59.059
I'm quite certain he's done
everything in his power

16:59.123 --> 17:01.361
to keep Michelle and Lily safe.

18:16.611 --> 18:17.981
So, Magnum,

18:18.781 --> 18:21.786
you probably weren't
expecting to hear from me.

18:22.319 --> 18:24.924
I'm making this little
tape for you from jail.

18:24.988 --> 18:27.993
But of course, I won't
be here when you get it.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.498
I wish I could
watch it with you.

18:31.562 --> 18:34.367
I think you're going
to be very surprised.

18:34.665 --> 18:37.003
Unfortunately,
I can't risk that,

18:37.636 --> 18:40.708
even though I would love
to see your expression.

18:43.710 --> 18:46.715
My friends do excellent work,
don't you think?

18:54.956 --> 18:56.258
Come on, Lily.

18:56.324 --> 18:58.462
I should pack some
things for my husband.

18:58.527 --> 19:01.087
He's brought everything he needs
from the office. We have no time.

19:02.498 --> 19:04.936
Edward, I'm so sorry
about all this.

19:05.001 --> 19:06.804
It's okay, Michelle.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.144
No, Lily. There's no time. Lily.

19:12.843 --> 19:13.946
Lily!

20:10.310 --> 20:11.612
Come on, Lily.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.882
I should pack some
things for my husband.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.507
He's brought everything he needs
from the office. We have no time.

21:24.359 --> 21:26.497
Dear Lily Catherine,

21:26.763 --> 21:29.836
I guess I've never really
told you all the things

21:29.900 --> 21:31.870
I wanted to do with you.

21:32.268 --> 21:34.740
Places I've thought about
showing you,

21:34.805 --> 21:37.711
books I've thought about
giving you to read,

21:37.943 --> 21:40.983
the Christmas mornings I've
thought we would share,

21:41.047 --> 21:43.384
your graduation
from high school.

21:43.783 --> 21:46.588
I guess even the arguments
we would have

21:46.652 --> 21:49.257
if you were still here,
close to me.

21:50.557 --> 21:52.360
I've just lived on blind faith

21:52.426 --> 21:55.365
that we would do
all those things somehow.

21:57.499 --> 21:58.701
Thomas!

22:02.938 --> 22:04.140
Thomas!

22:14.284 --> 22:15.687
So you know.

22:20.893 --> 22:23.965
Thomas, I don't know how
it could have happened.

22:27.533 --> 22:28.869
We were...

22:30.203 --> 22:31.706
We were moving

22:32.338 --> 22:34.341
Michelle and Lily. They...

22:37.378 --> 22:41.452
Buck was doing everything in his
power to make sure they were safe.

22:43.385 --> 22:45.856
We still don't know for sure
how Quang Ki's men found out.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.627
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

22:48.691 --> 22:50.561
I know
it's no consolation, Thomas,

22:50.626 --> 22:52.863
but Buck is devastated
by what's happened.

22:52.963 --> 22:54.666
Why was Quang Ki released?

22:54.731 --> 22:56.401
I don't know, yet.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.803
There's something
very big going down,

22:58.869 --> 23:01.274
but they're keeping it
very quiet.

23:01.438 --> 23:03.943
I haven't been able
to get anything.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.614
I haven't been able
to find out anything

23:07.680 --> 23:10.285
on Judge Haruda or Rankin.

23:11.117 --> 23:12.452
What else?

23:13.686 --> 23:17.261
That girl that you saw in Buck's
office is Annie Rockwell.

23:18.291 --> 23:22.265
She's a student, a graduate student
of Sociology and Criminology.

23:22.930 --> 23:25.335
She's just a friend
of the family.

23:27.836 --> 23:30.374
Buck Greene doesn't have
any friends.

28:13.399 --> 28:14.568
Hello?

28:15.335 --> 28:16.537
Thomas!

28:16.802 --> 28:18.405
What time is it?

28:18.972 --> 28:21.410
I've been trying to call you all night.
Where have you been?

28:21.708 --> 28:23.445
Shopping. What've you got?

28:26.514 --> 28:27.617
Come on, Maggie.

28:28.517 --> 28:30.254
I'm going to tell you this

28:30.352 --> 28:32.456
because I know you'll
understand when I do,

28:32.521 --> 28:34.826
why you have to stay out
of the whole thing. Okay?

28:35.223 --> 28:36.225
I'm listening.

28:38.094 --> 28:41.601
They're exchanging Ki for
an American POW. An MIA.

28:44.234 --> 28:47.006
Do you realize what the
implications of this are, Thomas?

28:47.505 --> 28:50.677
If there's one living POW,
there've got to be others.

28:50.741 --> 28:53.113
Some of those guys have been
over there for 20 years.

28:53.178 --> 28:55.148
Longer for some of them.

28:55.414 --> 28:57.551
This is an incredible
breakthrough, Thomas.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.121
I mean, if we can get
this one man out,

29:00.186 --> 29:02.691
maybe he can give us
information about the others.

29:02.755 --> 29:05.075
And that's why I know you'll
understand why I can't tell you

29:05.092 --> 29:07.129
where the exchange
is gonna take place.

29:07.194 --> 29:08.997
Who knows, Thomas,
maybe we can...

29:09.063 --> 29:11.735
Maybe we can
get them all home somehow.

29:11.899 --> 29:14.103
We've got to stay out of this.

29:14.202 --> 29:16.206
I know you'll understand.

29:51.984 --> 29:55.202
I've been thinking about
the first time I saw you.

29:55.282 --> 29:59.591
And how much you changed between
five years old and six years old.

30:00.454 --> 30:04.696
And I've been wondering what you
looked like on your seventh birthday.

30:05.328 --> 30:07.733
It's funny,
I can't quite see you.

30:08.463 --> 30:11.570
I wish your mom could have
sent me a picture.

30:13.137 --> 30:16.944
But I have pictures of you
in my head,

30:17.975 --> 30:20.180
pictures of things
we haven't done together.

30:20.245 --> 30:22.650
Ice skating
at Rockefeller Center,

30:22.714 --> 30:24.751
snorkeling at Hanauma Bay,

30:24.949 --> 30:27.989
cheering and screaming
at Tiger Stadium,

30:29.155 --> 30:34.032
and those pictures are as clear to
me as if they actually happened.

31:54.052 --> 31:55.255
You what?

31:55.321 --> 31:57.258
How could you let
something like this happen?

31:57.323 --> 31:59.995
Those papers were supposed to
be destroyed before we left.

32:00.059 --> 32:01.829
Yes, sir. I know, sir.

32:01.895 --> 32:03.632
Who the hell got in the files?

32:03.696 --> 32:04.865
I don't know, sir.

32:04.932 --> 32:07.202
Find out. And you'd better
start praying, Lieutenant.

32:07.268 --> 32:08.904
Your bars
are riding on this one.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.238
Yes, sir.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.110
Magnum.

32:16.078 --> 32:17.413
He's here.

33:46.682 --> 33:48.652
It's possible
he's penetrated the compound.

33:48.717 --> 33:50.153
I want him found. Yes, sir!

33:50.220 --> 33:52.300
Nothing is going to go wrong
with the exchange today.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.324
Is that understood?

33:53.391 --> 33:54.693
Yes, sir!

35:01.936 --> 35:03.171
Miss Rockwell?

35:04.071 --> 35:05.140
Yes?

35:06.908 --> 35:10.180
I'm Commander Magnum,
I'm going to be your escort.

35:10.646 --> 35:13.318
But I already met a young
man, a Lieutenant Broski.

35:13.383 --> 35:14.986
He's indisposed.

35:15.284 --> 35:16.587
Dysentery.

35:16.653 --> 35:17.855
Oh, no.

35:19.056 --> 35:20.391
Have we met?

35:20.457 --> 35:22.562
Yes. In Colonel Greene's office.

35:22.627 --> 35:24.430
In Hawaii. Of course.

35:25.330 --> 35:29.405
I'm a bit at a disadvantage, taking
over for Broski on short notice.

35:29.468 --> 35:32.407
Could you brief me
on what he told you?

35:34.140 --> 35:35.242
Okay.

35:36.842 --> 35:39.982
At 1600 hours
we assemble on the airstrip

35:40.047 --> 35:41.884
at the east side of the tarmac.

35:41.948 --> 35:46.324
At 1610 the helicopter transport
from Nouvelle Anjou will set down.

35:46.821 --> 35:51.263
They will disembark and assemble
on the west side of the tarmac.

35:51.894 --> 35:53.697
Commander Rockwell...

35:55.798 --> 35:57.067
Commander...

35:58.268 --> 35:59.603
I'm sorry.

36:00.538 --> 36:02.975
It's just sometimes
I can't believe

36:03.574 --> 36:06.479
in an hour I'm actually
gonna see my father.

36:06.911 --> 36:08.146
I always knew he was alive

36:08.212 --> 36:10.817
because he promised me
he'd come back.

36:11.817 --> 36:14.221
I was five years old
when he left.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.523
He gave me this.

36:17.789 --> 36:21.062
It's just glass, but he
called it a diamond ring

36:21.127 --> 36:23.832
because of a song
he used to sing to me.

36:24.598 --> 36:27.972
And he said when he came back,
he'd get me a real one.

36:28.869 --> 36:32.611
And I knew, if my daddy said he
was coming back, then he was.

36:32.874 --> 36:35.679
And I never gave up hope,
not in 20 years.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.619
You'll probably think
this is silly,

36:42.017 --> 36:44.422
but I wrote him
all these letters.

36:45.522 --> 36:47.660
Every birthday, at Christmas,

36:48.426 --> 36:50.062
when I graduated,

36:51.062 --> 36:52.832
when my mother died.

36:53.565 --> 36:56.170
It was my way
of staying close to him.

36:58.738 --> 37:02.212
This is the last picture we
took before he was captured.

37:03.710 --> 37:05.714
And now, he's almost here.

37:09.049 --> 37:10.117
Yes?

37:10.317 --> 37:12.655
J Lieutenant Broski
Miss Rockwell.

37:13.053 --> 37:16.627
There's our Lieutenant. I bet
he's a little wobbly-legged.

37:19.395 --> 37:21.732
Just checking in on you, ma'am.
See if you need anything.

37:21.797 --> 37:24.970
Well, Lieutenant, didn't anybody
tell you not to drink the water?

37:25.034 --> 37:26.136
Beg pardon?

37:26.202 --> 37:28.206
Oh, I heard all about it.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.450
Listen up, Corporal,
this is important.

37:38.383 --> 37:40.921
I don't wanna sound a big alarm,
make the Vietnamese nervous,

37:40.985 --> 37:42.722
but he's here somewhere.

37:42.789 --> 37:45.361
Either in the compound
or up in the hills.

37:45.425 --> 37:47.095
Find him, quietly.

37:47.327 --> 37:48.429
Aye, aye, sir!

37:48.495 --> 37:50.600
And when you do, shoot him.

38:52.535 --> 38:54.873
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

38:55.071 --> 38:59.180
I ever catch you setting so much as
your little toe in my country again,

38:59.243 --> 39:03.150
and I'm gonna personally rip your
heart out through your throat.

39:05.684 --> 39:07.154
You got that?

39:17.997 --> 39:19.767
Colonel, we need to talk.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.637
Excuse me. Gentlemen.

39:25.373 --> 39:28.479
We've combed the area, sir.
There's no sign of him.

41:59.084 --> 42:02.324
About face. Forward march.

44:43.341 --> 44:44.509
Daddy!

44:49.814 --> 44:51.083
You okay?

44:51.449 --> 44:52.952
I'm home, baby.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.765
And so, Lily Catherine,

45:03.830 --> 45:06.903
even though I know
you will never read this,

45:06.967 --> 45:09.305
I needed to write you
to tell you

45:10.105 --> 45:14.848
I once did something that I think
would have made you proud.

45:18.381 --> 45:19.617
And now, you see the President

45:19.682 --> 45:21.362
greeting Captain Rockwell
and his daughter.

45:22.618 --> 45:24.388
The Administration has
offered no real explanation

45:24.454 --> 45:27.694
as to what kind of deal was struck
to gain the release of Rockwell

45:27.758 --> 45:30.730
who has been listed missing
in action for 18 years.

45:30.795 --> 45:33.500
But this can only be seen
as the most positive step

45:33.565 --> 45:36.337
in reclaiming any more
US military personnel

45:36.402 --> 45:39.007
that may still be alive
in Southeast Asia.

45:39.071 --> 45:43.547
The Vietnamese government has said
there are no live POWs in Vietnam,

45:43.609 --> 45:46.849
but they have not said the same
thing about Laos or Cambodia,

45:46.913 --> 45:49.718
which are totally under
the domination of Hanoi.

45:49.783 --> 45:54.092
Despite this fact,
2,411 men and two women

45:54.155 --> 45:57.763
remain classified as Missing In
Action from the Vietnam War.

45:57.826 --> 46:00.631
Welcome home,
Captain Edward Rockwell,

46:00.696 --> 46:03.635
and long may you live
in peace and happiness.
