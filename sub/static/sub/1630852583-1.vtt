WEBVTT

00:31.944 --> 00:33.946
OK.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.300
Well, why aren't you upset?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.213
I mean, I am.

00:40.313 --> 00:44.667
But it's fine. You
obviously have your reasons.

00:44.677 --> 00:48.191
Do you want to know
what they are?

00:48.201 --> 00:50.093
I mean, if you don't think
we should keep
seeing each other,

00:50.103 --> 00:51.955
I'm certainly not
going to force you.

00:51.965 --> 00:53.557
We've been seeing each other
for three months

00:53.567 --> 00:57.399
and you have never once
opened up to me.

00:57.409 --> 00:58.282
I do have a little girl
to consider.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.695
A little girl?
She's 11.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.128
It was a big step for me
to start dating again.

01:05.138 --> 01:07.050
You're a grown man, aren't you?
Maybe it's time for you

01:07.060 --> 01:09.443
to put on your big-boy pants
and be emotionally available.

01:09.943 --> 01:13.616
There's a lot for me to
navigate, with regard to Emma.

01:13.626 --> 01:16.989
Oh. Thank you so much
for reminding me.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.261
Please don't be sarcastic.

01:18.271 --> 01:20.190
Can you please not be
a piece of shit?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.945
OK... um...

01:21.955 --> 01:25.428
Emma's in a really fragile
state right now.

01:25.438 --> 01:28.031
She keeps having these
full-on panic attacks.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.193
I'm not even sure
if I know how to stop them.

01:30.203 --> 01:34.236
Then I should talk to her.
I'm an empath.

01:34.246 --> 01:35.990
OK, are we ready to order?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.002
Does it look like we're ready?
Fuck off!

01:42.535 --> 01:44.537
You don't think I'd make
a good mother, do you?

01:49.502 --> 01:51.214
I'm the one
breaking up with you.

01:51.224 --> 01:52.485
Please don't
take this away from me.

01:52.585 --> 01:54.847
I'm sorry?

01:54.947 --> 01:56.209
- You're antiquated.
- I'm antiquated?

01:56.309 --> 01:58.571
You're old-fashioned, outdated.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.322
No, I know what the term
'antiquated' means.

02:00.332 --> 02:02.785
You're a dinosaur.

02:02.795 --> 02:04.817
And do you know what
happened to the dinosaurs?

02:04.917 --> 02:08.060
- Mm-hm.
- A flaming meteor
crashed into them

02:08.160 --> 02:11.103
and they died
because they weren't ready.

02:11.203 --> 02:13.125
Can anyone really be ready
for a meteor?

02:13.225 --> 02:15.526
Well, you're certainly not.

02:15.987 --> 02:17.209
And you're a three.

02:17.309 --> 02:18.770
- I'm a three?
- Mm-hm.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.552
Usually, I'm a seven.

02:20.652 --> 02:22.654
But when I'm with you,
I'm a nine.

02:25.316 --> 02:29.141
Emma would be sooo lucky
to have a mum who's a nine.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.892
Can you please stop
making a scene?

02:30.902 --> 02:33.046
Oh, my God! Stop trying
to control everything!

02:33.444 --> 02:35.446
You can't control everything!

02:40.833 --> 02:43.213
And traffic is
starting to back up on the A20.

02:43.314 --> 02:44.935
Now here's Tony
with the weather.

02:45.034 --> 02:48.219
Thanks, Karen. After a
chilly night of 7.5 degrees,

02:48.320 --> 02:50.340
Adelaide is in for
a sunny one today,

02:50.439 --> 02:52.984
with a high of 25 degrees
in the city,

02:53.083 --> 02:55.306
while the lower southeast
Mt Lofty region...

03:09.177 --> 03:11.701
- Hey, bubs.

03:11.802 --> 03:13.652
Gotta go.

03:13.751 --> 03:15.175
Em?

03:15.273 --> 03:17.377
Look, I know how tricky
today must be for you.

03:17.476 --> 03:20.159
- It is for me too...
- Dad!

03:20.256 --> 03:22.702
Right.

03:22.801 --> 03:24.601
Uh, I'll meet you outside,
then, OK?

03:37.135 --> 03:39.135
I don't need your help.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.561
We're not going to
make it in time.

04:02.662 --> 04:04.345
I was trying to get you out
of your room this morning-

04:04.423 --> 04:06.423
I had to finish Earth.

04:10.948 --> 04:12.612
Go that way.

04:12.713 --> 04:13.653
Bubs, we're better off staying

04:13.749 --> 04:15.753
- on the usual route, I'm telling you.
- It's not moving!

04:45.652 --> 04:47.653
Hey, over here!

04:49.897 --> 04:51.041
Emma, no.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.307
- Dad!
- No, no.

04:52.408 --> 04:52.985
- Stop.
- I said no.

04:53.086 --> 04:54.329
Dad!

04:54.430 --> 04:57.630
You gotta be kidding me.
It's too damn early.

04:57.675 --> 04:59.703
Hey, how are you?

04:59.713 --> 05:02.168
- We gotta go.
-Hope these sandwiches are OK.
-Thank you.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.321
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

05:05.122 --> 05:06.382
You cannot do things like that.

05:06.478 --> 05:07.781
- He's homeless.
- I don't care.

05:07.882 --> 05:09.262
He could be dangerous.

05:09.363 --> 05:11.363
It is my job to keep you safe.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.995
-Hey! Are you calling?
-Somebody call an ambulance!

05:48.004 --> 05:49.783
No airbags. No airbags.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.507
- Em?

05:52.603 --> 05:55.074
Em, it's me it's daddy.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.911
I'm here. You're OK.

05:57.016 --> 05:59.086
Hi. Are you OK?

05:59.096 --> 06:01.198
- She gets panic attacks.
- Yeah. OK. I get it.

06:02.199 --> 06:03.500
Look at me. Look at me. OK.
I just need you to look at me.

06:04.257 --> 06:06.257
There's something in her bag.

06:14.752 --> 06:16.752
Coming, Em! Coming, baby!

06:19.113 --> 06:21.199
- Em! Em!

06:24.843 --> 06:26.959
Em! You're... OK.

06:33.891 --> 06:35.891
What did you say to her?

06:36.810 --> 06:39.310
What did you do?

06:39.411 --> 06:41.420
She hit your car.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.449
Oh, God.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.728
It's to stop me
from turning my head.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.829
- Does it hurt?
- Who is it, bubs?

07:38.074 --> 07:40.978
Um, hi.

07:41.079 --> 07:43.055
You gave me your address,
through insurance.

07:43.156 --> 07:45.858
I wanted to say sorry for...

07:45.959 --> 07:47.656
for wrecking your universe.

07:47.666 --> 07:49.175
I read it when I was your age,
and I loved it.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.673
You don't know my age.

07:51.683 --> 07:54.472
- 11?
- I'm 12 in two months.

07:54.968 --> 07:57.194
That's a thoughtful gesture.
What do you say, Em?

07:57.295 --> 07:59.117
No?

07:59.209 --> 08:01.353
You don't want to say anything?

08:01.455 --> 08:03.521
Well, at least she took it.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.358
Um... Do you want to...

08:05.459 --> 08:07.603
This is a complete
invasion of...

08:07.704 --> 08:09.526
I should not have...
I shouldn't have come here.

08:09.627 --> 08:10.882
What? No, no.

08:10.983 --> 08:13.084
Hey. Um...

08:13.185 --> 08:15.185
Hey! Hey!

08:18.396 --> 08:20.656
Uh... Hey!

08:20.753 --> 08:22.733
Wait up!

08:22.834 --> 08:24.834
What was your name, again?

08:29.045 --> 08:31.305
Mary.

08:31.406 --> 08:33.743
Would you, uh,
like a cup of Gary?

08:33.753 --> 08:34.990
Fuck.

08:35.000 --> 08:35.658
Tea.

08:35.826 --> 08:37.886
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mary?

08:38.488 --> 08:40.488
My name is Gary.

08:42.136 --> 08:44.136
Sure.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.423
How long have you
been in Australia?

08:50.021 --> 08:52.021
Uh, 12 years.

08:57.386 --> 08:59.011
That's Emma's mom.

08:59.111 --> 09:01.608
My ex-wife.

09:01.711 --> 09:03.569
She live far away?

09:03.672 --> 09:06.405
Uh, yes...

09:06.415 --> 09:08.278
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I said ex-wife.

09:08.877 --> 09:10.499
Um.

09:10.598 --> 09:12.021
She died.

09:12.124 --> 09:13.742
Oh.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.953
Cancer.

09:15.963 --> 09:18.276
Um, I'm sorry.

09:18.286 --> 09:20.526
Oh. Well, thank you.
We're used to it by now.

09:20.536 --> 09:21.831
As used to it as you can be,
I guess.

09:23.136 --> 09:25.136
- Uh, milk?
- Yeah.

09:26.576 --> 09:27.838
What was her name?

09:27.932 --> 09:29.838
Lisa.

09:29.941 --> 09:31.877
- Oh, shit.
- What?

09:31.986 --> 09:33.554
The book I gave her -

09:33.564 --> 09:36.558
the mom is dead and she
lives alone with her dad.

09:36.568 --> 09:38.990
Oh, God. Well, I wouldn't
worry about that too much.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, then her dad dies
and leaves her all by herself.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.007
Mmm.
She may actually like that bit.

09:47.194 --> 09:48.738
- Agh!

09:48.838 --> 09:50.461
- Are you OK?
- Uh, yeah.

09:50.559 --> 09:52.530
I just dropped the, uh...
Damn!

09:52.540 --> 09:54.086
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- That is a lot of blood.

09:54.684 --> 09:56.215
I would put that under the tap.

09:56.225 --> 09:57.000
- I'm gonna go get a bandaid.
- I'll get you a bandaid.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.997
- OK. Sure.
- Tell me where to go.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.220
- It's, uh,
just down the hallway,

10:01.230 --> 10:02.153
and it's gonna be the bathroom,
last door on the right.

10:03.134 --> 10:05.134
OK.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.188
You said you knew where I was.

10:24.511 --> 10:26.415
After the accident.

10:26.511 --> 10:27.800
When I was scared.

10:27.832 --> 10:30.457
You said that
you'd been there too.

10:31.161 --> 10:33.161
Oh, I have.
A bunch of times.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, there's a lot of blood
coming out of your dad.

10:52.043 --> 10:53.505
I'm gonna stick some of this...
This is eucalyptus oil...

10:57.867 --> 10:59.329
It's gonna sting.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.917
- I'm sorry.
- Brave. Brave.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.312
Yeah. I'm gonna do two.
I'm gonna do two.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.980
- Mm-hm.
- I'll make it quick.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.990
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- Oh, gosh. Sorry.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.461
- It hurts a lot.
- Does it really?

11:08.496 --> 11:10.496
Yeah. I want to pretend
like it doesn't.

11:14.845 --> 11:16.845
What, uh, brought you here?

11:19.886 --> 11:21.627
Truthfully?

11:21.730 --> 11:23.736
Um...

11:26.374 --> 11:28.310
There was something
about your daughter.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.728
At the accident, I...
I know this sounds like a
complete weirdo thing to s...

11:31.738 --> 11:33.132
I'm so sorry.

11:33.142 --> 11:35.709
I meant what brought you
to Australia?

11:35.719 --> 11:36.899
Oh.

11:36.909 --> 11:39.099
Idiot. Um...

11:39.109 --> 11:42.369
Uh... I...
I wanted a change.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.336
Whereabouts in America?

11:45.434 --> 11:47.576
- Chicago.

11:47.675 --> 11:49.297
Can't get more of a change
than Chicago to Adelaide.

11:50.096 --> 11:52.798
Mm-hm. You bet.

11:53.201 --> 11:55.999
Why did you choose Adelaide?

11:56.009 --> 11:58.955
Uh, I can work from anywhere.

11:58.965 --> 11:59.877
What do you do?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.540
I volunteer places.
I do stuff for charities.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.653
So I go to
a nursing home every day,

12:05.252 --> 12:07.226
I make and donate stuff.

12:07.236 --> 12:09.257
Oh. Did you mean what do
I do for a living?

12:10.057 --> 12:11.791
Oh, right, um...

12:11.801 --> 12:13.503
Uh, I give relationship advice
in a column.

12:14.502 --> 12:16.761
Wow!
What kind of qualifications

12:16.863 --> 12:17.990
do you need
for something like that?

12:18.000 --> 12:22.042
Oh, I have an undergraduate
degree in psychology, um,

12:22.069 --> 12:23.942
but I don't really use it, um,

12:23.952 --> 12:25.790
well, I stopped pursuing that
when I got here,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.909
'cause it was really hard for
me to do the one-on-one stuff.

12:28.954 --> 12:30.361
How come?

12:31.399 --> 12:33.401
Um...
Why did you come here?

12:36.684 --> 12:38.537
Lisa was Australian.

12:38.547 --> 12:42.172
Um, so we moved
when she was pregnant.

12:42.271 --> 12:48.526
And then, uh, after she died,
um...

12:48.536 --> 12:51.520
I just felt like
I couldn't take Emma
away from Lisa's family.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.203
Felt like it would hurt her
too much to leave them behind.

12:59.268 --> 13:01.268
Emma? You OK?

13:02.425 --> 13:04.672
- Oh!
- Oh! God! W...

13:04.770 --> 13:06.674
- It's all over you!
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.316
I...I... You're sorry?
I'm sorry!

13:08.414 --> 13:09.797
- Have you got a tea towel?
- Yes.

13:09.895 --> 13:12.039
We are not good with mugs.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.143
Last time you're gonna
see mugs over here.

13:18.501 --> 13:20.610
Do you need anything else?
Like ice?

13:20.711 --> 13:22.711
Ice or anything?

13:38.924 --> 13:40.925
Mary!

13:41.646 --> 13:43.000
Mary.

13:43.097 --> 13:45.100
Are we really doing this again?
Are you OK?

13:45.197 --> 13:47.869
I just... I felt like...

13:47.965 --> 13:49.868
You know, I gave your daughter
an inappropriate book, and...

13:49.945 --> 13:51.423
Like I said, it's seriously not a big deal.

13:51.527 --> 13:53.229
- But then I smashed
one of your mugs.
- It's just a mug.

13:53.327 --> 13:55.213
- I just feel like I should go.
- It's just a mug.

13:55.295 --> 13:57.595
You'd already smashed a mug.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.596
Look, you, um,

14:00.692 --> 14:02.978
coming in to check on Emma
was a very thoughtful gesture.

14:03.058 --> 14:04.677
I did hit you both with my car.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.962
You did.
And I am planning on suing you.

14:13.109 --> 14:15.109
I've been struggling
a lot lately.

14:17.171 --> 14:20.054
Emma's got all sorts of issues.

14:20.156 --> 14:22.156
I don't, frankly,
know how to handle them.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.342
You speaking to her
after the accident, I...

14:28.444 --> 14:31.823
I don't know what you said,
but, um...

14:31.925 --> 14:34.371
I'm having a really hard time
articulating myself right now.

14:34.448 --> 14:36.010
Uh...

14:36.106 --> 14:37.629
Can I maybe take you out
to dinner tomorrow,

14:37.715 --> 14:38.518
to talk about her?

14:38.619 --> 14:40.818
Oh, I can't do that.

14:40.919 --> 14:42.977
Oh. I'm so sorry.

14:43.073 --> 14:45.256
I did not mean to overstep
my boundaries.

14:45.361 --> 14:46.977
No! No.
I mean I can't do dinner.

14:47.078 --> 14:48.823
Um...

14:48.919 --> 14:50.544
I could do lunch.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.645
Tomorrow?

14:53.645 --> 14:55.270
Sure. I could do
lunch tomorrow.

14:55.371 --> 14:56.627
- Great.
- OK.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.000
Promise you won't
run away again?

14:58.101 --> 15:00.925
Uh, yeah, yeah. No, I mean,
I can't promise that.

15:43.627 --> 15:44.908
I don't know,
between work and Emma,

15:45.013 --> 15:47.986
I don't really feel like
I have much time for myself.

15:47.996 --> 15:50.085
- I get that.
- What about you?

15:50.095 --> 15:52.754
- Oh, I have lots of hobbies.
- Like?

15:52.855 --> 15:56.262
Well, I speak four languages.
I do topiary.

15:56.358 --> 15:58.180
Um, quilting and knitting.

15:58.281 --> 16:00.584
Pickling and pottery.

16:00.685 --> 16:02.867
I spent a full year
doing close-up magic

16:02.963 --> 16:04.687
to entertain
at the nursing home.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.648
Muay Thai.

16:06.749 --> 16:08.417
And I make cheese.

16:08.513 --> 16:10.252
You make topiaries?

16:10.353 --> 16:13.858
- Like, building things out of trees?
- Shrubs.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.957
Where do you even begin to
learn something like that?

16:16.038 --> 16:17.423
Online.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.519
Oh. This is it.

16:21.627 --> 16:22.848
It's amazing - it's been
run by the same family

16:22.944 --> 16:24.887
for the past 60 years.

16:24.992 --> 16:26.372
- Gianni, how are you?
- Hey, Gary!

16:26.473 --> 16:27.848
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.

16:27.949 --> 16:30.252
- Alfie, how are you?
- Table for two?

16:30.353 --> 16:31.497
I can't eat there.

16:31.598 --> 16:33.694
Uh, hang on a sec.

16:34.295 --> 16:36.769
Hey!

16:36.779 --> 16:38.404
- You don't like Italian food?
- Uh, I've got allergies.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.747
- I'm vegan.
- What to?

16:40.248 --> 16:42.117
Italian food.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.305
OK. I'm so sorry.
I wish I had checked...

16:43.406 --> 16:46.228
It's not your fault!

16:46.329 --> 16:47.213
Is it a gluten thing?
They have great
gluten-free pizza.

16:47.295 --> 16:49.295
What about here?

17:21.327 --> 17:23.548
I haven't heard music in a bar
for 12 years.

17:23.651 --> 17:26.231
What are you talking about?

17:26.334 --> 17:28.716
I haven't been out in a really,
really, really long time.

17:28.812 --> 17:31.158
How's that even possible?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.017
I get why someone like me
hasn't been to...

17:32.100 --> 17:33.716
Do you dance?

17:33.822 --> 17:35.720
Uh, probably going to need to

17:35.822 --> 17:38.084
drink a lot more
before that can happen.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.187
- That was really expensive.
- Mmm.

17:41.151 --> 17:42.885
What music are you into?

17:42.988 --> 17:44.528
I don't listen to music.

17:44.629 --> 17:47.452
Why? No. Really?

17:47.555 --> 17:50.095
Do you know
this is Melody Gardot?

17:50.197 --> 17:52.697
Melody Gardot?

17:52.798 --> 17:54.459
- Wow.
- Oh, oh! Melody Gardot?

17:54.562 --> 17:57.142
- No, I don't.
- OK.

17:57.247 --> 18:00.664
Well, before Melody Gardot
was THIS Melody Gardot,

18:00.760 --> 18:02.988
she was actually... More.
..hit by a car.

18:03.086 --> 18:05.626
She was in hospital
for a year, with memory loss.

18:05.729 --> 18:07.475
But there was this physician
who believed

18:07.568 --> 18:10.394
that he could heal her brain
through music.

18:10.495 --> 18:12.401
So he taught her to hum
and then to sing.

18:12.495 --> 18:14.318
And now here she is!

18:14.414 --> 18:17.245
And if she hadn't been
hit by that car,

18:17.341 --> 18:19.001
we wouldn't be
listening to that voice.

18:19.104 --> 18:23.086
That voice melts spines.

18:29.394 --> 18:32.180
Why don't you like music, Gary?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.700
Well, Mary, I like it.

18:34.798 --> 18:36.220
I just don't listen to it
anymore.

18:36.322 --> 18:39.825
Why?

18:39.923 --> 18:43.548
We had trouble settling Emma
when she was a baby.

18:43.651 --> 18:45.872
'Cause she would cry all the time.
We tried everything.

18:45.970 --> 18:48.153
And then one day we worked out

18:48.254 --> 18:49.997
the only thing that
would make her sleep...

18:50.091 --> 18:52.095
- Was what?

18:54.459 --> 18:55.379
The only thing that
would make her sleep

18:55.459 --> 18:56.961
is when I would sing to her.

18:57.062 --> 18:58.642
Aw. What would you sing?

18:58.747 --> 18:59.966
Just a song.

19:00.062 --> 19:02.526
- Can I hear it?
- No.

19:02.626 --> 19:04.626
No, I haven't sung that
since she was little.

19:05.508 --> 19:07.334
- Come on, Gary.
- No.

19:07.432 --> 19:09.412
- Gary!
- No. No.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.180
- No, no, no.
- OK.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.776
What if the reason
we ended up here

19:13.876 --> 19:17.702
is so that you could sing
again?

19:17.805 --> 19:20.423
The music stopped!
You're laughing,
but it's meant to be!

19:20.526 --> 19:22.466
- Come on.
- It's not gonna happen.

19:22.566 --> 19:23.988
I'll cover my eyes.
I'm not even gonna look at you.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.385
Look, I'm looking at my hands.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.908
You can cover your entire body.

19:28.010 --> 19:30.193
- I don't want to sing
right now.
- Come on, Gary.

19:30.289 --> 19:31.995
- My God.
- Do you want me
to go under the table?

19:32.095 --> 19:33.716
No! Just... Stop
bringing attention to us.

19:33.816 --> 19:35.635
OK. Just do it. Really quietly.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.240
I'm not gonna judge you.

19:37.341 --> 19:39.341
Thanks, I appreciate that.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.836
OK, OK.

Clearly, it didn't work.
You're still awake.

21:01.466 --> 21:03.443
I think you should sing it
for her again.

21:03.546 --> 21:05.164
Fuck, no.
She would hate that.

21:05.267 --> 21:07.289
No, I bet she wouldn't.

21:07.385 --> 21:09.392
You don't know my daughter.

21:13.394 --> 21:16.100
-You said...
-Hey, no, no, no.

21:16.193 --> 21:19.423
The secret to the answer
is in the questions.

21:19.526 --> 21:22.305
You find out what it is that
THEY want to do,

21:22.403 --> 21:25.350
then you advise them to do it.

21:25.443 --> 21:26.408
But, then, sometimes,
I honestly have to
make up the question,

21:26.488 --> 21:27.950
because it's so boring.

21:28.055 --> 21:29.912
- You make them up?
- Mmm.

21:30.010 --> 21:32.010
- Isn't that against the law?
- No.

21:33.937 --> 21:36.999
OK.

21:37.100 --> 21:40.363
I just kind of draw on my, um,
life experience, I guess.

21:40.461 --> 21:41.966
Give me an example. You've
got to give me an example.

21:42.062 --> 21:44.283
OK.
Dear Adelaide...

21:44.385 --> 21:45.850
- Adelaide?
- Adelaide.

21:45.947 --> 21:48.854
Dear Adelaide, I, um,

21:48.952 --> 21:52.173
I feel like I'm doing
a bad job as a dad,

21:52.276 --> 21:55.017
and my little girl has trouble
telling me what she needs.

21:55.122 --> 21:57.856
So I try to make everything
perfect around her,

21:57.959 --> 22:00.026
but it doesn't seem to
make her happy.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.539
And I don't know what to do.

22:01.644 --> 22:03.062
Sincerely, G.

22:03.164 --> 22:05.385
G? OK.

22:05.488 --> 22:06.385
I can relate. Go on.

22:06.488 --> 22:09.033
Dear G,

22:09.126 --> 22:10.751
you say you're trying to
make everything perfect,

22:10.850 --> 22:13.680
but perfect doesn't exist.

22:13.776 --> 22:17.758
Perfect's the armour we wear to
stop ourselves from being seen.

22:17.856 --> 22:19.760
And maybe it's the thing that's
stopping your little girl

22:19.856 --> 22:22.883
from seeing you
and feeling close to you.

22:22.981 --> 22:25.086
Maybe you should
run towards imperfections,

22:25.187 --> 22:31.495
and laugh and cry
and dance, sing.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.254
Get messy.

22:33.354 --> 22:36.017
Messy's good.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.122
Break yourself open -
it's how the light gets in.

22:39.356 --> 22:41.363
Always, Adelaide.

22:45.086 --> 22:46.466
When did you
come up with that one?

22:46.572 --> 22:49.385
Right now.

22:49.490 --> 22:51.033
I'm trying to get you
to sing to your kid.

22:51.129 --> 22:53.555
Right...

22:53.658 --> 22:56.716
Can I ask, um...

22:56.822 --> 23:00.682
what you did in the car
for Emma?

23:00.783 --> 23:02.783
I could see
she was scared in there.

23:03.943 --> 23:06.370
She's done that before.

23:06.466 --> 23:09.533
It's like she's built this
fortress around herself,

23:09.626 --> 23:11.626
so that nothing can hurt her.

23:12.716 --> 23:14.716
I'm doing everything I can.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.461
I get scared sometimes.

23:21.562 --> 23:23.562
Scared of what?

23:25.930 --> 23:28.466
Somehow I caused all of this.

23:28.568 --> 23:31.751
After Lisa died, I spiralled.

23:31.850 --> 23:33.354
Emma was four.

23:33.459 --> 23:36.517
And, um...

23:36.622 --> 23:39.999
Took me years before I felt
like I could be her dad again.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.162
I know it probably
doesn't feel this way,

23:42.260 --> 23:43.966
but you're already doing
the best thing for her.

23:44.062 --> 23:46.606
You're present.

23:46.709 --> 23:50.171
And she may be pushing you
away, but you're there.

23:50.269 --> 23:52.372
I mean, that kind of stability
is so rare, Gary.

23:52.475 --> 23:55.336
It's... It's fucking priceless.

23:55.437 --> 23:57.459
I can't believe I just
unloaded all that on you.

23:57.557 --> 23:59.783
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
- No! No. No, it's OK.

23:59.879 --> 24:01.026
- I'm an advice columnist.
- Oh, God.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.664
- That's fine.
- You know what?

24:03.760 --> 24:05.260
I help everybody
with their problems.

24:05.365 --> 24:08.269
- You know what, Mary?
- What?

24:08.370 --> 24:10.591
I'm not gonna sue you anymore.

24:10.691 --> 24:11.731
No, I promise. I'm gonna call
my lawyer tomorrow.

24:11.812 --> 24:13.874
I just...

24:13.975 --> 24:14.937
I can't believe
I'm giving anyone advice.

24:15.010 --> 24:17.758
My life is a mess.

24:22.863 --> 24:24.865
Messy is good.

24:35.231 --> 24:37.238
Who put on that song?

24:39.200 --> 24:42.702
- I don't know.
- Did you just put on the song?

24:42.805 --> 24:44.747
I've been sitting here
with you.

24:44.841 --> 24:46.664
Um, I need to go.

24:46.767 --> 24:48.307
Did I do something wrong?

24:48.408 --> 24:50.908
No, I just feel like this is,
um...

24:51.010 --> 24:53.952
I shouldn't have put myself
in this situation.

24:54.055 --> 24:56.680
- What situation?
- I haven't day-drunk
in a really long time, so...

24:56.778 --> 24:58.798
I don't think it's day anymore.

24:58.901 --> 25:00.158
- Really? What time is it?
- After 6.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.260
Oh, fuck!

25:15.874 --> 25:18.376
Dear Adelaide,

25:18.479 --> 25:20.901
I've been alone
for a really long time.

25:20.999 --> 25:23.423
A boy has appeared and made
himself vulnerable to me.

25:23.526 --> 25:25.341
He has made me question

25:25.443 --> 25:27.870
why I've chosen to live
a certain way.

25:27.966 --> 25:29.834
I feel like
I'm running from my past,

25:29.930 --> 25:32.673
and I can never reveal
who I really am.

25:32.776 --> 25:34.789
I've been badly hurt.

25:34.894 --> 25:38.316
I feel lost,
and I don't deserve love.

25:38.414 --> 25:41.158
How do you know when that
person is the right one?

25:41.260 --> 25:43.260
Sincerely, M.

25:45.747 --> 25:49.008
Dear M, thank you for writing.

25:49.106 --> 25:51.691
Losing yourself - I'm not
going to sugar-coat it -

25:51.789 --> 25:54.776
that's the worst thing
you can do.

25:54.874 --> 25:57.615
Don't stop believing
in who you are.

25:57.716 --> 25:59.258
It's one thing to know that

25:59.356 --> 26:01.461
kindness and vulnerability
matter,

26:01.562 --> 26:05.624
but the first person
you need to be kind to is you.

26:05.725 --> 26:09.187
We're all feeling our way
through the dark.

26:09.287 --> 26:12.191
- Stop running in circles.

26:12.289 --> 26:14.870
Stop running from yourself,

26:14.975 --> 26:16.475
and start running to the light.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.716
Oh, fuck!

26:18.816 --> 26:22.562
Don't lose track of your heart.

26:22.658 --> 26:27.526
It's the only thing
that's keeping you going.

26:27.626 --> 26:30.048
And remember,
you don't get what you need

26:30.151 --> 26:33.091
until you're brave enough
to admit that you need it.

26:33.191 --> 26:35.894
Jump in head-first
and fight for it -

26:35.997 --> 26:37.254
even if it means
fighting for yourself.

26:37.356 --> 26:39.356
Fuck!

26:40.914 --> 26:42.740
How do you know that

26:42.841 --> 26:44.981
this person is
the right one for you?

26:45.084 --> 26:47.305
You won't know
unless you open the door

26:47.408 --> 26:49.350
to the possibility that
you do deserve to be loved.

26:49.447 --> 26:52.269
Agh!

26:52.372 --> 26:55.394
Strip away the layers
and break yourself open.

26:55.497 --> 26:58.356
That's how the light gets in.

26:58.459 --> 26:59.557
Don't lock yourself
in your basement.

27:03.376 --> 27:05.383
- Always, Adelaide.
