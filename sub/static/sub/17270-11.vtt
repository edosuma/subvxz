That I'm a killer?

C'mon kiddo. Let's get

this to our own agents now?</i>

05:58.404 --> 06:00.673
What do you think she did?

06:00.675 --> 06:03.275
Must have really stepped
in it to get the needle.

06:03.277 --> 06:05.243
Your young colleague didn't make the cut.

06:06.946 --> 06:08.246
She didn't have the right stuff

06:08.248 --> 06:10.282
to continue along our agent track, so...

06:11.685 --> 06:14.619
let's just let this
rather unpleasant situation

06:14.621 --> 06:16.655
be an object lesson, shall we?

06:16.657 --> 06:19.624
Your powers are a privilege, not a right.

06:19.626 --> 06:22.026
And if we didn't need your
kind for certain functions,

06:22.028 --> 06:23.728
I would gladly de-power all of you.

06:25.798 --> 06:27.799
Now that said, you three did make the cut.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.701
So congratulations on that.

06:29.703 --> 06:32.170
But the winnowing process continues.

06:32.172 --> 06:34.939
We haven't finished separating
the wheat from the chaff.

06:36.942 --> 06:39.043
So how many of us get to keep our powers

06:39.045 --> 06:40.845
and become Ultra agents?

06:40.847 --> 06:42.213
And how many get chemically castrated?

06:42.215 --> 06:44.682
And how exactly are we being evaluated?

06:44.684 --> 06:47.084
By not screwing up.

06:47.146 --> 06:48.879
By not losing breakouts.

06:48.881 --> 06:50.381
By holding your hand over the candle

06:50.383 --> 06:52.983
until it burns you to the
bone, if that's what I ask.

06:54.085 --> 06:55.419
For example,

Well, he's back. Get on it.

What can you tell us about him?

What's his M.O.?

07:09.534 --> 07:12.035
Other than looking to recruit
young and impressionable paranormals

07:12.037 --> 07:13.870

- Magic.

We'll just let ourselves
in, if you don't mind.

09:01.042 --> 09:04.377
Ultra's on alert because this guy Julian
doesn't even try to hide his powers.

09:04.379 --> 09:05.945
Victim stories are consistent.

09:05.947 --> 09:09.248
He tortures them until he
himself basically collapses.

09:11.786 --> 09:14.787
Sounds like this guy is riding
the edge of the prime barrier.

09:14.789 --> 09:16.655
Even though our kind can't kill.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.058
Julian pushes the
envelope as far as he can.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.660
Like he gets off on it or something.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.263
Damn, what a sicko.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.833
Yeah, well, local cops are
starting to get suspicious.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.268
Sounds like Ultra's got it covered.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.872
Look, Cara, besides it
being the right thing to do,

09:33.874 --> 09:37.108
if I bring this guy in, it solidifies
my spot in the trainee program.

09:37.395 --> 09:39.629
Didn't know Ultra had its
own Triwizard Tournament.

09:39.631 --> 09:41.331
Hmm. Funny.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.399
But if you don't make the cut,
they strip you of your powers.

09:43.401 --> 09:44.968
You're his nephew, Stephen.

09:44.970 --> 09:46.636
You'll have to find some
other way to prove yourself.

09:46.638 --> 09:49.272
Julian is a nihilist.

09:49.274 --> 09:52.074
An anarchist. He doesn't
care about exposure. We do.

09:52.076 --> 09:53.409
And you know this guy?

09:54.545 --> 09:56.646
Our paths crossed when I first got to town.

09:56.648 --> 10:00.416
He and his girlfriend. He
wasn't exactly my style.

10:00.418 --> 10:03.319
RUSSELL: Well maybe it's worth
chatting with your old pal?

10:03.321 --> 10:05.420
At least see what he's doing back in town.

10:05.422 --> 10:08.323
We didn't part on the best terms.

10:08.325 --> 10:11.193
So we have inside info on this
guy and we are doing nothing.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.028
We're not doing nothing. We're monitoring.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.730
Through you.

10:14.732 --> 10:17.066
Right, because that strategy
worked so well with Killian McCrane.

10:17.068 --> 10:19.701
We're not the paranormal police, Stephen.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.169
What do you think, John?

10:22.372 --> 10:23.705
Is that your call too?

10:26.476 --> 10:28.076
It's not my call.

10:28.078 --> 10:29.077
It's Cara's.

10:30.747 --> 10:33.482
But if Julian could be
convinced to crawl back

10:33.484 --> 10:35.150
to where he came from,

10:35.152 --> 10:36.351
it could save us a lot of trouble.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.453
Fine.

10:40.756 --> 10:42.456
Don't say I didn't warn you.

10:44.593 --> 10:46.427
These pants are really tight.

10:46.429 --> 10:48.263
(CHUCKLES) They're supposed to be tight.

10:49.564 --> 10:51.632
You look insanely great.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.535
Good, you shrugged off
the wet street rat look.

10:54.537 --> 10:56.103
That's step one.

10:56.105 --> 10:58.038
I didn't know it was a process.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.440
Step two.

10:59.442 --> 11:01.275
The men in suits who were chasing you,

11:01.277 --> 11:03.411
that's Ultra. They hunt people like us.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.013
Don't scare her, Julian.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.548
You convinced me to
bring in your little pet.

11:07.550 --> 11:10.483
If she's gonna do what we do,
she needs to know these things.

11:10.485 --> 11:12.686
And that she can't just be a pretty face.

11:12.688 --> 11:15.722
What is it you do? I don't understand.

11:15.724 --> 11:19.259
We're a superior species
but we're hunted like rats.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.394
We should be batting them
around like play toys.

11:21.396 --> 11:22.696
What do you mean?

11:22.698 --> 11:24.664
We'll show you.

11:24.666 --> 11:26.466
But first...

11:26.468 --> 11:30.337
you need to practice using your powers.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.572
Build up your strength and skill.

11:38.446 --> 11:40.447
We start by toughening you up.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.682
- Helping you find the killer inside you.
- Julian.

11:43.684 --> 11:45.051
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING)

11:45.053 --> 11:47.619
The world is divided
into predators and prey.

11:47.621 --> 11:49.121
(CHOKING)

11:49.123 --> 11:50.656
Which one are you, Cara?

11:50.658 --> 11:52.458
Julian. Stop.

11:52.460 --> 11:53.759
Stop.

11:55.128 --> 11:57.063
(GASPING)

11:58.631 --> 12:00.065
Are you okay?

12:02.168 --> 12:03.969
Yeah. Yeah.

12:05.004 --> 12:06.672
Good. Your turn.

12:09.576 --> 12:11.142
Don't know if it's in you?

12:12.545 --> 12:16.114
Walk into Ultra right now
and surrender your powers.

12:16.116 --> 12:18.283
Best case scenario. That's all you'll lose.

12:19.475 --> 12:21.142
Worst case.

12:21.144 --> 12:23.478
They'll kill you, or cook your brain.

12:25.547 --> 12:27.382
You stick with us,

12:27.384 --> 12:29.717
we'll teach you how to survive.

12:29.719 --> 12:31.652
And then...

12:31.654 --> 12:33.187
we'll teach you to live.

12:51.898 --> 12:54.701
How do you know Julian's going to show?

12:54.703 --> 12:56.869
I sent up a psychic signal flare.

12:56.871 --> 12:59.038
If he's anywhere on
the island, he heard it.

13:00.173 --> 13:02.141
JULIAN: Cara Coburn.

13:02.143 --> 13:03.976
What a pleasure.

13:03.978 --> 13:06.712
- Julian.
- I see you're still affecting Nelly's style.

13:06.714 --> 13:07.980
And her attitude.

13:07.982 --> 13:09.882
Pale imitation.

13:09.884 --> 13:11.951
You're still the same old Cara.

13:11.953 --> 13:13.518
We're here to warn you.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.587
You're on Ultra's radar and local police,

13:15.589 --> 13:17.756
I suggest you disappear. Now.

13:17.758 --> 13:20.291
Thanks, but I just got back.

13:20.293 --> 13:22.828
Ultra is more powerful
than when you left Julian.

13:23.996 --> 13:26.130
- As am I.
- Ooh.

13:26.132 --> 13:28.734
So it's leave or you give me the boot?

13:28.736 --> 13:29.868
Who's going to make me?

13:29.870 --> 13:32.536
You and your formidable new gang?

13:32.538 --> 13:35.106
I've heard about your sorry existence.

13:35.108 --> 13:37.876
Lives spent stuck underground.

13:37.878 --> 13:40.211
You all look vitamin-deficient.

13:40.213 --> 13:42.180
Have some fun. Soak up the sun.

13:42.182 --> 13:43.714
Who is this guy?

13:43.716 --> 13:45.183
Acting like he owns the town.

13:46.351 --> 13:48.652
I do own it.

13:48.654 --> 13:50.220
Say the word, Cara,

13:50.222 --> 13:52.923
and I will drop this
punk like a bag of dirt.

13:52.925 --> 13:54.291
What'll it be, Julian?

13:54.293 --> 13:56.293
Like you have the right to speak to me.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.728
Let alone look me in the eye.

13:57.730 --> 13:59.263
Let's just try and keep it civil.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.566
We are not at war with the SAPs.

14:03.568 --> 14:05.869
We are trying to coexist.

14:05.871 --> 14:08.538
Humans took everything from me.

14:11.109 --> 14:12.475
You remember?

14:13.577 --> 14:14.644
You were there.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.648
We do not torture people.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.916
It doesn't serve anyone's interest.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.551
They actually follow you?

14:21.553 --> 14:22.886
These two puppies?

14:22.888 --> 14:25.889
Do they realize what a
jelly-spined, ineffectual skank

14:25.891 --> 14:27.524
they've thrown in with? (CHUCKLES)

14:27.526 --> 14:28.991
Amazing that you're still alive.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.594
As weak and pathetic as
you were back in the day...

14:31.596 --> 14:33.262
That's it. Ass-kicking time.

14:38.635 --> 14:40.002
He's not worth it.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.271
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.107
New York is mine, bitch.

14:50.948 --> 14:54.049
Remember, the name of the
game is Pin Your Opponent.

14:54.051 --> 14:56.785
On the count of three, you will use
your grappling and fighting skills

14:56.787 --> 14:58.954
to make that happen. Understood?

14:58.956 --> 15:00.155
Hope you had a hearty breakfast.

15:00.157 --> 15:02.223
You are my breakfast, dickhead.

15:02.225 --> 15:04.059
Ooh, such big words from such a tiny girl.

15:04.061 --> 15:05.961
One, two, three.

15:14.270 --> 15:16.204
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- What? Are you okay?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.605
(GRUNTS)

15:19.308 --> 15:20.575
(GROANS)

15:24.013 --> 15:25.847
This round belongs to Hillary.

15:27.683 --> 15:28.783
Yeah, thanks.

15:40.529 --> 15:42.963
That guy's posse'd up, huh?

15:42.965 --> 15:45.532
Where'd Julian find all those breakouts?

15:45.534 --> 15:47.701
Those guys look prison hard.

15:49.137 --> 15:51.138
I'm sure Julian scoured the planet

15:51.140 --> 15:54.041
for sadistic scum just like him.

15:54.043 --> 15:56.276
So what's the plan, boss?

15:56.278 --> 15:57.744
Don't call me boss.

15:59.046 --> 16:00.780
We lay low.

16:00.782 --> 16:02.749
Now that we know that
Julian has a psycho army,

16:02.751 --> 16:03.917
we just have to wait.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.418
Wait until when?

16:05.420 --> 16:07.521
Thanks to his recklessness,
Ultra will catch up with him.

16:07.523 --> 16:09.589
We don't have the numbers to take him on.

16:09.591 --> 16:10.957
We should keep tabs on him.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.960
Just in case he decides
to come after us first.

16:13.962 --> 16:15.561
How do you want to tail him?

16:16.730 --> 16:18.164
I will.

16:18.166 --> 16:21.867
Uh, maybe you should stay with the troops.

16:21.869 --> 16:23.269
I'll go.

16:23.271 --> 16:25.738
I'll be like a piece of gum on the wall.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.640
Any developments you report back.

16:27.642 --> 16:29.075
And don't engage him.

16:29.077 --> 16:30.976
And Russell...

16:30.978 --> 16:32.110
be careful.

16:42.856 --> 16:44.657
I'll be right back, ladies.

16:44.659 --> 16:46.124
- Just gonna find the safe.
- Okay.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.726
Come on.

16:50.763 --> 16:52.264
Are you sure this is okay?

16:52.266 --> 16:54.166
Yeah Julian says people
like this are always insured,

16:54.168 --> 16:56.000
- over-insured.
- (DOOR OPENING)

16:56.002 --> 16:59.137
So when we take their stuff,
they're actually making money.

17:08.012 --> 17:09.180
Hello?

17:12.617 --> 17:15.086
- I'll handle this.
- Let's just go.

17:15.088 --> 17:16.654
- We're not done.
- MAN: Someone here?

17:16.656 --> 17:18.189
No talking.

17:21.193 --> 17:22.759
I know there's someone in the house.

17:23.795 --> 17:25.762
- Hey.
- I'm calling the police.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.699
Drop the phone.

17:28.701 --> 17:29.666
(GRUNTING)

17:31.103 --> 17:32.069
Nelly!

17:33.805 --> 17:34.905
Tie him up.

17:36.575 --> 17:37.608
Help me.

17:38.743 --> 17:40.176
Cara, help me.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.815
- (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING)
- (CHARLOTTE SCREAMING)

17:44.817 --> 17:45.816
Charlotte.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.124
Charlotte! It's me!

17:54.126 --> 17:57.093
Open your eyes, it's only a dream.

17:57.095 --> 17:58.728
Wherever you are, it's not real

17:58.730 --> 18:00.796
just come back to me. Follow my voice.

18:00.798 --> 18:04.134
It's not real. You're safe
here, no one can hurt you.

18:06.504 --> 18:08.138
What happened?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.939
JOHN: It's okay. (DEEP BREATHING)

18:11.441 --> 18:13.575
You're okay.

18:13.577 --> 18:14.877
Charlotte.

18:16.647 --> 18:19.815
Her attacks are starting to
attack everyone around her.

18:19.817 --> 18:21.450
It's only getting worse.

18:21.452 --> 18:24.954
With all they've been through
recently, people are starting to talk.

18:24.956 --> 18:26.155
About what?

18:27.990 --> 18:30.626
About kicking her out of the lair.

18:30.628 --> 18:31.793
I didn't say I was for it.

18:31.795 --> 18:33.529
Because that's what they do here now?

18:33.531 --> 18:34.829
Kick the weak from the herd.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.233
Look maybe the group is

18:38.235 --> 18:40.602
just starting to feel a little unsettled.

18:40.604 --> 18:42.704
You know, being under
new leadership and all.

18:44.073 --> 18:48.209
Hey, look, we all feel sorry for the kid.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.245
So what, we just put
her back on the street?

18:51.247 --> 18:52.981
Let Ultra snatch her up again?

18:56.618 --> 18:57.952
Is that what you guys want?

19:00.656 --> 19:03.090
Chloe's first month, she
screamed in her sleep.

19:03.092 --> 19:07.228
And before we trained him, Dunbar's
telekinesis was like a firehouse.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.963
If we kicked out everyone
who showed up with bruises,

19:09.965 --> 19:11.532
this place would be empty.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.802
Charlotte stays.

19:17.471 --> 19:19.039
Then who's going to babysit her?

19:21.676 --> 19:22.876
I will.

19:33.854 --> 19:35.655
May I present to you,

19:35.657 --> 19:40.059
the residences of Central Park West.

19:40.061 --> 19:43.430
Seventy-three of the city's
premiere luxury apartments,

19:43.432 --> 19:46.032
and home to four hedge fund managers,

19:46.034 --> 19:51.137
seven CEOs, 14 independently
wealthy families.

19:51.139 --> 19:54.506
In other words, "human garbage."

19:54.508 --> 19:56.642
Just like the bastard
who used to live here.

19:56.644 --> 19:58.677
But he got his and they will too.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.747
So...

20:00.749 --> 20:02.715
Who'd like to go on a
shopping trip with me?

20:02.717 --> 20:03.983
ALL: Yeah.

20:03.985 --> 20:07.152
The little piggies are picking up the tab.

20:07.154 --> 20:08.787
(ALL CHEERING)

20:19.437 --> 20:20.437
(GRUNTS)

20:23.341 --> 20:25.209
(PANTING)

20:25.211 --> 20:27.077
Okay, this is good.

20:27.079 --> 20:28.713
That's not good, this isn't going to work,

20:28.715 --> 20:31.148
I'm going to be thrown out, I'm
going to have to live on the street.

20:31.150 --> 20:34.618
You are not going to be thrown out, okay?

20:34.620 --> 20:37.654
I'm trying to do what you said.
I'm concentrating on my breathing.

20:37.656 --> 20:40.157
No, you're learning to
concentrate on your breathing.

20:40.159 --> 20:42.426
Once you master it, you'll be able to...

20:42.428 --> 20:44.495
you'll be able to take all that anger,

20:44.497 --> 20:47.030
frustration, confusion,

20:47.032 --> 20:49.332
and turn it into something good.

20:50.701 --> 20:52.736
How do you know all this?

20:52.738 --> 20:56.305
Well, I was taken by
Ultra when I was your age.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.143
Maybe even younger.

21:00.145 --> 21:01.978
It seems like you turned out okay.

21:04.648 --> 21:05.648
Well...

21:07.217 --> 21:11.554
only after I was able
to take my fear of them,

21:11.556 --> 21:14.424
what I thought was my greatest weakness,

21:14.426 --> 21:16.392
and turn it into something powerful.

21:17.661 --> 21:18.661
How?

21:22.432 --> 21:26.702
By taking all the darkness
that's trapped inside you,

21:26.704 --> 21:28.537
and using it as a weapon.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.140
Close your eyes, Charlotte.

21:33.577 --> 21:35.044
Close your eyes.

21:39.014 --> 21:43.318
All those horrible memories are like clouds

21:45.020 --> 21:46.688
passing through your mind.

21:46.690 --> 21:48.656
And the cloud that's about Ultra

21:50.426 --> 21:51.726
is black.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.561
And it blocks out the sun.

21:55.030 --> 21:56.631
But now imagine that you

21:56.633 --> 21:59.200
reach out with one hand.

22:00.435 --> 22:03.404
You take that black cloud and...

22:04.406 --> 22:05.506
(GRUNTS)

22:08.210 --> 22:09.510
Destroy it.

22:11.446 --> 22:12.946
Destroy it.

22:21.089 --> 22:24.458
This is the place Julian was
targeting his next attack.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.059
- Which apartment?
- All of them.

22:27.061 --> 22:29.695
He's calling it a shopping
trip. Sounds like B&E.

22:29.697 --> 22:32.598
It's not the loot they're after.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.569
Julian will terrify and torture
anyone he can get his hands on.

22:36.571 --> 22:38.538
What's this guy got against humans?

22:38.540 --> 22:40.273
He thinks they're weak.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.974
That our kind is superior.

22:43.242 --> 22:45.243
Julian can't kill

22:45.245 --> 22:46.745
so he figures beat them half to death

22:46.747 --> 22:48.681
and then scare them the rest of the way.

22:48.683 --> 22:50.582
If we can get a suppression cup on him,

22:50.584 --> 22:52.484
I'm betting the rest of
his mutts will scatter.

22:52.486 --> 22:54.319
And if they don't?

22:54.321 --> 22:56.121
I don't want any of our people compromised.

22:56.123 --> 22:59.158
I'm not talking about
everyone, I'm talking about me.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.092
Russell, it was a recon mission.

23:01.094 --> 23:03.595
I'm passing this off to Stephen,
let Ultra deal with them.

23:04.930 --> 23:06.264
You got it...

23:06.266 --> 23:07.532
Chief.

23:08.668 --> 23:10.968
What? Didn't call you "boss".

23:16.408 --> 23:18.609
Stephen, I got a head's
up on Julian's next move.

23:20.512 --> 23:22.146
Don't take any chances with him.

23:22.148 --> 23:24.115
You need to take him out
and deliver him to Ultra

23:24.117 --> 23:25.717
before the rest of his crew realizes.

23:25.719 --> 23:27.985
No way he's more dangerous
than my sparring partner.

23:27.987 --> 23:29.220
(GRUNTING)

23:31.023 --> 23:32.423
- AGENT: Stephen.
- Coming.

23:35.026 --> 23:36.694
You don't know Julian like I do.

23:40.031 --> 23:41.465
(GROANS)

23:41.467 --> 23:43.434
Make sure she doesn't move an inch.

of the bindings and he took off.

Got a reprieve from my uncle.

38:44.219 --> 38:46.019
So, go team.

38:48.022 --> 38:50.123
And we made it through the day.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.393
I guess I should be happy.

38:52.395 --> 38:55.962
Cara, it's over, okay? Whatever
hold Julian had on you...

38:55.964 --> 38:57.063
It's gone.

38:57.065 --> 38:59.132
It was his girlfriend.

38:59.134 --> 39:00.200
Nelly.

39:02.203 --> 39:04.171
Only person he ever cared about.

39:07.008 --> 39:09.109
She was my first friend

39:09.111 --> 39:10.743
that was like us.

39:11.745 --> 39:12.946
She got shot.

39:16.717 --> 39:18.951
Julian said it was because I was weak.

39:18.953 --> 39:21.854
No. Julian exploited you.

39:21.856 --> 39:24.791
Okay? He tried to control
you through fear and hate.

39:26.026 --> 39:27.760
Yeah, that's what I tell myself.

39:29.129 --> 39:32.798
Somehow, it doesn't quite sink in.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.202
Cara, think about what happens if
Julian finds someone like Charlotte.

39:38.671 --> 39:40.840
- Okay? But you...
- (CARA LAUGHING)

39:40.842 --> 39:43.442
- Are you gonna try and give me another pep talk?
- You bet.

39:43.444 --> 39:45.644
Well, John already beat you to it, so...

39:48.648 --> 39:50.114
It's sweet, though.

39:51.384 --> 39:53.084
I guess we both care about you.

39:56.255 --> 39:59.257
I am going to go check on Russell.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.766
If I am such a great leader,
why can't I get them figured out?

40:08.768 --> 40:12.803
<i>TIM: Perhaps you enjoy the thrill
of being pursued simultaneously</i>

40:12.805 --> 40:15.139
<i>by two equally desirable mates.</i>

40:16.308 --> 40:19.277
It was rhetorical, Tim.

40:19.279 --> 40:22.012
<i>Right. Sorry. I'll be quiet.</i>

40:26.685 --> 40:29.019
Hey! Where've you been?

40:29.021 --> 40:30.855
Tried calling you last night.

40:30.857 --> 40:32.857
I know. I was out. I'm sorry.

40:32.859 --> 40:36.026
I take it that, wherever you were,
you were not studying for Calculus.

40:36.028 --> 40:37.327
No.

40:37.329 --> 40:39.029
But it's cool.

40:39.031 --> 40:40.931
You think summer school is cool?

40:40.933 --> 40:45.202
Well, you're not failing Calculus, which
means I'm not failing Calculus either.

40:46.337 --> 40:47.971
Don't even think about it.

40:47.973 --> 40:49.940
You don't get to cheat off my mind.

40:49.942 --> 40:53.142
No, Astrid. I would never.

40:53.144 --> 40:56.846
I am not okay with this.
And we're late. I hate you.

40:56.848 --> 40:59.416
Really? 'Cause I thought you loved me.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.785
Okay, okay... I'm just... (LAUGHING)

41:32.748 --> 41:35.149
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

41:37.686 --> 41:39.454
I'm just like you.

41:39.456 --> 41:40.988
My name's Julian.

41:43.492 --> 41:45.359
Hey, you wanna learn some magic?

41:46.695 --> 41:47.894
Come on.
