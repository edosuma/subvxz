09:26.520 --> 09:29.780

WITH MY WEAK ROBOT LEGS!

09:34.120 --> 09:36.100

09:36.200 --> 09:39.020

09:39.120 --> 09:41.020
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BLOW.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.740
( MANIACAL LAUGHTER
CONTINUES )

09:44.840 --> 09:47.760
( COMPUTER BEEPING RAPIDLY )

10:01.280 --> 10:03.420
YEAH, YOU REALLY
DODGED A BULLET ON THAT ONE.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.820
I STILL WISH
I COULD PROVE

10:04.920 --> 10:06.860
THAT I'M MORE THAN JUST
A MUSCLE MAN.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.380
MAYBE I'M NOT
AS SMART AS I THOUGHT.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.500
OH, YOU'RE SMART,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.260
JUST A DIFFERENT
KIND OF SMART.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.540
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND
YOUR OWN WAY OF SHOWING IT.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.900
I THINK
I GOT ONE MORE IDEA

10:17.000 --> 10:19.260
THAT WILL PROVE
THAT I'M SMART.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.020
Muscle Man:
BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS,

10:21.120 --> 10:22.940
I CHECKED HIS COMPUTER,
RIGHT?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.980
AND I TOLD HIM,
HE HAS A PRETTY BAD VIRUS.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.620
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
HAS A PRETTY BAD VIRUS?

10:28.720 --> 10:30.720
MY MOTHERBOARD.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.380
WELL,
AT LEAST HE'S STRONG.
