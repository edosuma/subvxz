Good... Perfect!

00:42.626 --> 00:44.503
Oh, Solarman!

00:46.713 --> 00:50.092
Careful. It's fragile!
Truck number four. Thank you!

00:55.681 --> 00:56.848
Huh?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.438
Huh?

01:10.362 --> 01:12.281
Mark, we need you on the set!

01:22.249 --> 01:24.793
<i>We're like a movie‐star couple,</i>
<i>don't ya think?</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.461
<i>Huh?</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:27.713
Hey, Baker!

01:27.713 --> 01:29.590
Quit photobombing my selfie.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.841
This is <i>our</i> close‐up.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.760
Always a pleasure, Stacy!

01:33.760 --> 01:37.097
What do you mean the actress is
a no‐show? Our scene is today!

01:37.097 --> 01:41.226
How is Solarman gonna save
a hostage if there's no hostage?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.771
We've got to find someone
to replace her quick

01:44.771 --> 01:46.189
or this movie's a bust.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.905
"Help... er, Solarman...

01:53.905 --> 01:57.492
I'm, like, totally being held
against my will."

01:57.492 --> 01:59.870
‐ (Cheering)
‐ You taking up acting?

01:59.870 --> 02:03.665
Me? Uh... No...
But the actress is AWOL,

02:03.665 --> 02:07.419
so I thought Mom and Dad
could use my improv skills!

02:07.419 --> 02:10.589
Come on! I'm sure I can be
excellent on camera!

02:10.589 --> 02:12.633
I mean, I'm made for it, right?

02:13.508 --> 02:16.928
Probably. But you have to play
a victim in distress,

02:16.928 --> 02:19.306
and I'm not feeling
any distress.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.352
Screaming for help is a combo
of 46% fear, 21% stress,

02:23.352 --> 02:25.145
and 33% sheer panic.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.024
Thanks for the notes,
but I'm good.

02:29.024 --> 02:33.987
STACY: Help! Help! Aaah!

02:33.987 --> 02:37.282
‐ Ugh!
‐ (Applause)

02:38.408 --> 02:40.952
Hear that?
Now, that's believable!

02:40.952 --> 02:43.872
What? Stacy
is so not stealing my role!

02:56.009 --> 02:57.678
Heh, heh!

02:59.471 --> 03:01.264
(Panting)

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
So,
cast anyone for the role yet?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.938
Yes! Good thing
your friend Stacy was here.

03:07.938 --> 03:12.359
Yeah... About that, are you sure
she's fit for the part?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.945
I mean,
her acting's a bit... screamy.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.240
I know, right?
Exactly what we need, sweetie.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.575
Her audition
was positively spine‐tingling!

03:21.660 --> 03:24.162
<i>Places, please!</i>
<i>Shooting starts in in five!</i>

03:27.624 --> 03:28.291
(Groans)

03:35.841 --> 03:37.384
Heh, heh! Boo!

03:44.516 --> 03:46.852
"Solarman leaps in with gusto

03:46.852 --> 03:50.021
and frees the imprisoned damsel
like a total hero."

03:50.021 --> 03:51.815
Yep, that's me!

03:52.607 --> 03:53.483
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

03:55.152 --> 03:56.611
<i>And... action!</i>

03:57.112 --> 04:02.909
<i>Help! Save me!</i>
<i>I'm being held against my will!</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:06.997
Hmm? What's he doing?
Why isn't he on set yet?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.207
‐ Huh?
‐ (Evil laugh)

04:09.833 --> 04:10.876
Aaah!

04:13.170 --> 04:15.130
‐ You OK, Andy?
‐ Yeah, what's up?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.923
You miffed Stacy got the part?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.134
Who? Me? What? No!

04:19.551 --> 04:22.053
I mean, if Mom and Dad
want a total amateur,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.723
‐ I'm cool with that.
‐ I don't know.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.768
‐ I think she's got talent.
‐ At messing everything up!

04:27.768 --> 04:32.731
‐ Ow!
‐ Xhypno! Xhypno!

04:32.731 --> 04:36.318
‐ Help!
‐ See? What'd I tell you?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.237
Right, but that's not Stacy.
That's a ghost!

04:39.237 --> 04:42.449
‐ Aaah!
‐ Whoo! (Evil laugh)

04:45.952 --> 04:48.121
Let's go, Ghost Force!

04:48.121 --> 04:50.624
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

04:56.713 --> 04:57.756
Fury!

04:58.757 --> 05:00.050
Krush!

05:01.760 --> 05:03.178
Myst!

05:06.264 --> 05:07.516
Ghost Force!

05:09.267 --> 05:14.397
‐ Xhypno!
‐ Hello! Save me, Solarman!

05:16.316 --> 05:19.861
What's our plan? All it's doing
is giving people a green thumb.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.281
Not everyone. Stacy's clueless
as usual under that blindfold.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.700
We're dealing with a mesmeriser,

05:25.700 --> 05:27.327
but what's with all the plants?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.789
<i>Excellent question, Krush!</i>
<i>And the answer is...</i>

05:30.789 --> 05:33.917
<i>I have no idea!</i>

05:33.917 --> 05:36.211
<i>I've never encountered</i>
<i>this ghost before,</i>

05:36.211 --> 05:39.965
<i>but judging by his Boo energy,</i>
<i>it must be a level nine!</i>

05:39.965 --> 05:40.882
Don't worry, Ms Jones.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.218
It's like this ghost's
already in my Boocaps!

05:45.637 --> 05:46.596
Ha! Whoa!

05:47.597 --> 05:48.849
(Evil laugh)

06:01.069 --> 06:04.114
(Evil laugh)

06:04.114 --> 06:05.323
Oh!

06:08.827 --> 06:10.287
Whoa!

06:17.002 --> 06:19.045
Uh...
it might take a little longer.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.172
See to it! Glowboo
will rendez‐vous with you

06:21.172 --> 06:23.174
as soon as he's recharged.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.969
Again? My smartphone
has better battery life!

06:25.969 --> 06:28.680
Uh, yeah. Perhaps
it's because I've requested

06:28.680 --> 06:31.141
too many foot massages
from him between missions.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.935
My new heels are killing me!

06:33.935 --> 06:37.314
I know. Let's attack it
where it can't reach us.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.985
ALL: Xhypno...

06:50.368 --> 06:53.038
So much
for the element of surprise!

06:53.788 --> 06:55.624
Aaah!

07:05.425 --> 07:10.096
Look! No hands!
That's the boo style! Yahoo!

07:10.096 --> 07:11.598
Huh?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.310
The gem!
We've got to destroy it!

07:15.310 --> 07:17.896
‐ Huh? Why?
‐ That's its power source, obvs.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.814
Cover me!

07:24.736 --> 07:27.280
What? What's the deal, Fury?
That gem was mine!

07:27.989 --> 07:28.948
Whoa!

07:34.954 --> 07:36.581
Back to square one.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.626
Remind me to ask Ms Jones
for in‐suit airbags.

07:39.626 --> 07:45.048
‐ Help! Help! Save me, Solarman!
‐ And earplugs too.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.843
‐ You're sounding a bit jelly.
‐ Because of Stacy?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.929
Come on, guys,
you gotta be kidding me!

07:50.929 --> 07:53.014
I don't know.
You've all the symptoms.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.685
‐ Touchiness, irritability...
‐ What? I am not jealous!

07:56.685 --> 07:58.103
And truth‐dodging.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.479
(Ghostly cry)

08:12.409 --> 08:15.829
‐ Xhypno! Xhypno!
‐ What the... ?

08:15.829 --> 08:19.040
‐ That looks like ‐‐
‐ A cocoon! Oh, this is bad.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.251
Soon, there won't be
just one ghost to fight,

08:21.251 --> 08:23.169
there'll be dozens!

08:23.545 --> 08:27.298
You only have minutes to stop
the OG, as in "original ghost".

08:27.298 --> 08:29.801
But how?
We can't even look at its face.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.765
With artificial intelligence.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.144
Since I am not affected by
gamma psycho‐cataleptic waves,

08:39.144 --> 08:40.937
the ghost can't mesmerise me.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.480
Then go smash that gem, Glowboo!

08:42.897 --> 08:45.734
Roger.
Smashing gems is now my jam.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.163
‐ Mission accomplished!
‐ Yeah!

08:58.163 --> 08:59.456
(Cracking)

08:59.456 --> 09:01.666
Hurry! The cocoons are hatching!

09:01.666 --> 09:04.502
Are you sure
the gem was its weak spot?

09:04.919 --> 09:05.920
Glowboo, watch out!

09:11.134 --> 09:13.386
(Screams)

09:13.386 --> 09:15.847
Glowboo!

09:20.310 --> 09:22.395
Sound. That's its weak spot!

09:25.231 --> 09:26.441
Fractal trap!

09:35.658 --> 09:38.536
OK... But how are we gonna
recreate a screech

09:38.536 --> 09:40.622
‐ as over‐the‐top as that?
‐ Stacy!

09:40.622 --> 09:43.416
She screamed so loud
that the lamp exploded!

09:43.416 --> 09:45.668
Nah, forget Stacy. I got this!

09:46.252 --> 09:49.089
Aaah!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.216
(Scream echoes)

09:51.216 --> 09:54.177
Sorry, bro, not shrill enough!
Go get Stacy!

09:54.177 --> 09:56.971
Fury, hurry!
I'm running out of Boo energy!

09:57.680 --> 10:00.433
Wait. One more try.
I can do this.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.393
Aaah... (Starts coughing)

10:02.393 --> 10:03.436
Fury! (Groans)

10:04.938 --> 10:06.272
Huh? What just happened?

10:08.942 --> 10:09.943
Oh, no!

10:14.364 --> 10:15.406
Aw, man!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.076
‐ Xhypno...
‐ Xhypno...

10:18.076 --> 10:19.410
Argh!

10:21.955 --> 10:25.083
Solarman? It's about time!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.627
(Groans) Solarman's
not available right now.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.630
I'm gonna need more screeching,
with a lot more feeling.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.092
Are you kidding? I've been
screaming non‐stop for hours!

10:36.219 --> 10:39.305
Please! I really need your help!

10:39.305 --> 10:42.350
Fine, but getting into character
takes time.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.310
I need somewhere quiet
to become...

10:46.104 --> 10:48.940
Aaah!

10:54.529 --> 10:55.780
Dragoyle!

11:12.172 --> 11:14.382
(Monstrous groan)

11:27.145 --> 11:29.689
Xhypno... Huh?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.567
‐ Huh?
‐ Boo‐ya!

11:32.984 --> 11:36.070
Fury? Hi! Can I have a selfie?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.365
Now we just gotta tow Glowboo
back to Ms Jones.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.451
He'll need a lot
of rest and recharging

11:41.451 --> 11:43.286
before he gives
another foot massage.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.834
‐ (Chuckles)
‐ <i>You saved me, Solarman.</i>

11:49.834 --> 11:54.172
<i>If only the world</i>
<i>had more heroes like you.</i>

11:54.172 --> 11:56.216
Gotta admit it, Stacy nailed it.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.093
And you totally nailed
being a superhero too!

11:59.093 --> 12:02.180
I know, right? I actually
took down a level‐nine ghost.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.726
‐ Ow!
‐ Your scream is improving!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.561
Maybe they'll cast you
in the sequel!

12:08.978 --> 12:11.105
‐ Maybe.
‐ (Laughter)

12:12.690 --> 12:14.108
(Creaking)

12:34.128 --> 12:34.796
Huh?

12:35.463 --> 12:36.589
Aaah!

12:38.341 --> 12:40.301
Aaah!

12:46.432 --> 12:49.352
(Fairground music)

12:49.352 --> 12:52.563
And, above all, don't forget
to time the rotation

12:52.563 --> 12:54.691
of the Ferris wheel. Ha, ha!

12:54.691 --> 12:56.067
Where's Andy?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.988
You did tell him about Professor
Pascal's surprise field trip?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.531
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.826
I even gave him a real
New Yorker pro tip to find us.

13:04.826 --> 13:08.579
Right. Got any pro tips
to stop him from oversleeping?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.833
(Huffing and puffing)

13:12.583 --> 13:14.502
(Phone rings)

13:14.502 --> 13:17.255
<i>Yo, Mike,</i>
<i>what's the deal with your text?</i>

13:17.255 --> 13:21.342
<i>"Central Park.</i>
<i>Lamp post 7810. West 100 yards.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:23.594
<i>'Cause if it's a joke,</i>
<i>I'm not sure I get it.</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:27.056
Fun fact. All the lamp posts
in Central Park are numbered.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.017
Sure beats using a GPS, huh?

13:30.059 --> 13:33.604
OK. Whatever.
But where am I supposed to go?

13:33.604 --> 13:35.648
It's simple.
Just follow the lamp posts.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.609
<i>The first two numbers</i>
<i>indicate the street.</i>

13:38.609 --> 13:40.528
<i>Even numbers</i>
<i>are on the east side.</i>

13:40.528 --> 13:44.365
<i>So, find lamp post 7810,</i>
<i>which is on East 78th Street,</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:46.159
<i>then head west for 100 yards.</i>

13:46.159 --> 13:50.329
Is lamp post 6423
anywhere close?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.081
Nope, you're way off.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.501
‐ Mike, maybe ‐‐
‐ I can't make it any easier!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.795
PROF PASCAL:
Liv! Mike! Your turn!

13:57.795 --> 14:00.298
Oh! Why isn't Andy with you?

14:00.298 --> 14:03.718
He's, uh... on his way!

14:04.135 --> 14:06.512
6617, 6625...

14:07.805 --> 14:09.766
You gotta be kidding me!

14:12.351 --> 14:14.854
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

14:19.942 --> 14:22.445
Come on, Andy,
thousands of New Yorkers

14:22.445 --> 14:25.073
have been using this system
since 1907.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.200
We're on the Ferris wheel.
The big round thingy.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.829
Oh, right. He could have
just led with that.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.664
I don't get it.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.917
I've used that technique
a million times.

14:35.917 --> 14:39.253
I'm sure you have. But you gotta
admit it's not exactly simple.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.589
But it is precise.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.633
(Panting)

14:43.633 --> 14:45.468
This is the worst pro tip ever!

14:45.468 --> 14:47.762
(Screaming)

14:51.682 --> 14:53.059
A ghost!

14:57.647 --> 14:59.232
Let's go, Ghost Force.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.785
‐ Er, Ms Jones?
‐ <i>Oh, hello, Mike. Pop quiz!</i>

15:10.785 --> 15:14.038
<i>What do you get when you mix</i>
<i>sulphur trioxide with water?</i>

15:14.038 --> 15:16.582
‐ Sulfuric acid, why?
‐ Ahem.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.461
Never mind. This ghost looks
like a polka‐dotted mushroom!

15:20.461 --> 15:22.797
You know, a Amanita muscaria?

15:26.551 --> 15:29.554
Oh, boy... That's Sporofungus!

15:29.554 --> 15:32.014
A level‐four ghost
of maximum grossness.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.893
More like maximum cuteness!
I can't wait to domesticate it!

15:35.893 --> 15:37.937
Let me guess.
It's a molecular ghost?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.940
<i>Right, and you must</i>
<i>prevent it from boosting.</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:44.861
Sure, but we're stuck on
the Ferris wheel with our class!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.738
<i>Ay‐ay‐ya‐ya.</i>
<i>Well, hang in there.</i>

15:47.738 --> 15:50.241
<i>I'll send Glowboo over</i>
<i>as soon as I can!</i>

15:50.241 --> 15:51.909
(Bang)

15:51.909 --> 15:55.454
<i>Oops! Looks like</i>
<i>I've still got some work to do.</i>

16:03.838 --> 16:05.673
Right behind ya, mushy!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.180
Well, that's was easy! Whoa!

16:19.228 --> 16:21.522
Aw!

16:21.522 --> 16:23.774
Ms Jones! Where is Glowboo?
Kinda running out of time here!

16:23.774 --> 16:26.110
<i>He's on his way!</i>

16:31.449 --> 16:32.909
Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:33.910 --> 16:36.621
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

16:41.417 --> 16:42.335
Krush!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.004
Myst!

16:47.423 --> 16:48.799
Ghost Force!

16:53.262 --> 16:54.305
Well done, buddy!

16:54.764 --> 16:56.307
Oh! This human
seems to be in danger.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.938
Aaah!

17:04.815 --> 17:07.068
We'll take care of the wheel.
You help Fury!

17:12.531 --> 17:14.659
Calculating.
I have enough strength

17:14.659 --> 17:18.788
to hold on for 26 seconds,
25, 24...

17:18.788 --> 17:20.289
‐ Spectral Gate!
‐ Aaah!

17:24.669 --> 17:27.171
BOTH:
Ew! You're a pimply monster!

17:29.799 --> 17:31.634
Did we all enjoy
the Ferris wheel?

17:31.634 --> 17:33.094
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ (Barks)

17:37.807 --> 17:39.850
Aaah!

17:40.851 --> 17:42.061
OK, these were the last!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.690
Excellent teamwork, Myst!

17:45.690 --> 17:47.108
Now I got to find the guys.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.987
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.782
‐ Now I got you!
‐ And I got your back!

17:54.782 --> 17:56.617
Man, am I glad to see you!

17:56.617 --> 17:59.662
All right, let's surprise it
with a circular attack.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.582
Wait on my ten o'clock until
I reach its transverse axis!

18:02.582 --> 18:04.458
What?
But it's barely even 9:30.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.128
Now!

18:16.470 --> 18:19.015
‐ (Groans)
‐ Boo!

18:20.349 --> 18:21.934
(Coughing)

18:21.934 --> 18:24.645
‐ What's the deal, dude?
‐ What's your deal?

18:24.645 --> 18:27.940
I told you wait on my
ten o'clock, as in 60 degrees!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.568
What language
are we even talking right now?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.945
Ugh!
What's so hard to understand

18:32.945 --> 18:35.114
about not blasting each other?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.450
‐ Now that I understand!
‐ Ugh!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.785
Guys, the city needs us.
Hurry up!

18:47.418 --> 18:49.545
But I was just trying
to be more precise!

18:49.545 --> 18:52.423
So precise you weren't
even making any sense!

18:52.423 --> 18:53.674
You tell him, sis.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.386
Wow, you reek like you ate
a thousand mushroom pizzas.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.889
I know, right?
And it's all his fault!

18:59.889 --> 19:01.974
Since when
is being precise a problem?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.935
Enough! We've got a ghost
to capture, remember?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.520
Where'd it go anyway?

19:09.732 --> 19:13.069
‐ Corner of Midtown and 5th Ave.
‐ Oh, you mean 40 degrees north,

19:13.069 --> 19:15.237
which is 2.7 miles away!

19:15.237 --> 19:18.616
Uh... Maybe you could
make an effort...

19:18.616 --> 19:21.786
Not you too!
Coordinates are more precise.

19:23.788 --> 19:27.166
Ready for catching. 40 degrees.
Roger and copy.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.334
Time for Boo‐fight!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.587
See? Glowboo gets me!

19:37.677 --> 19:39.887
(Screaming)

19:42.515 --> 19:43.432
Boo!

19:47.728 --> 19:48.396
It's about to boost!

19:57.947 --> 20:00.366
‐ What?
‐ Ha, ha!

20:07.748 --> 20:09.208
(Evil laugh)

20:20.010 --> 20:22.513
We can't reach it
unless it comes out of its hat.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.723
We've gotta stop Sporo

20:24.140 --> 20:25.933
or New York'll stink
even more than usual.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.309
It's moving away!

20:29.353 --> 20:32.356
It takes three seconds
between attack and retreat.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.775
So taking into account
its stealth, we've ‐‐

20:34.775 --> 20:37.069
No time for more mumbo jumbo!

20:38.070 --> 20:41.157
Sorry, but he's right, y'know.
You can't overthink this stuff.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.119
Fury, on its next attack
I'll open some portals and ‐‐

20:45.536 --> 20:47.163
I'll blast my flexy
through them!

20:49.790 --> 20:53.252
Your prefrontal cortical zones
indicate emotional distress.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.630
They don't get me.
It's like I'm speaking Latin.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.174
I did not know you could.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.178
What I mean is they think I make
everything sound complicated.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.764
You should reprogram
your speech

21:04.764 --> 21:07.516
to present your thoughts
more clearly, like how Ms Jones

21:07.516 --> 21:10.102
programmed me
to synthesise my data streams

21:10.102 --> 21:14.482
into one clear idea before
opening my gob, as she calls it.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.359
You mean synthetize my ideas
before I said it out loud?

21:18.194 --> 21:19.862
Well said, Glowboo!

21:21.197 --> 21:23.699
Synth... data...
str‐str‐streams... my g‐g‐gob.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.832
‐ Not again!
‐ We can't keep up.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.167
It's too fast!

21:35.920 --> 21:38.547
Fun's over, fungi!

21:40.549 --> 21:42.510
Whoa!
That's a boo‐tastic entrance!

21:44.053 --> 21:47.014
Whoa! I got it... all right!

21:47.014 --> 21:49.683
Whoa! Ah! Oof!

21:50.643 --> 21:52.478
Aaah!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.858
Listen up, I've got a plan!

21:59.193 --> 22:01.821
Sure, but I've got
one portal left, so keep it ‐‐

22:01.821 --> 22:04.740
Simple, gotcha.
But you gotta trust me on this.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.408
Always. Fire away.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.869
OK. We wait till Sporo
comes out of its hat.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.205
Then, Myst,
you open a portal right under it

22:11.205 --> 22:12.623
leading straight to Fury.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.960
Then, Fury, you keep it
from retreating into its hat.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.170
But you gotta be fast.
That Sporo is quick!

22:18.170 --> 22:19.922
Good, 'cause so am I!

22:33.018 --> 22:33.936
You're up, Myst!

22:44.780 --> 22:45.698
Huh?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.658
Fury!

22:50.327 --> 22:52.371
No more hiding under your hat!

22:54.832 --> 22:55.791
Simple!

22:58.544 --> 22:59.503
Gromax!

23:34.788 --> 23:35.915
Boo‐yah!

23:35.915 --> 23:37.708
(Cheering)

23:40.169 --> 23:42.254
Congrats, dude.
Your plan was amazing.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.840
And clearly explained!

23:44.840 --> 23:46.467
<i>Well done, kids.</i>

23:46.467 --> 23:48.302
<i>Oh, but could one of you</i>
<i>fetch Glowboo?</i>

23:48.302 --> 23:51.388
We're on it, Ms Jones,
but he's gonna need an update.
