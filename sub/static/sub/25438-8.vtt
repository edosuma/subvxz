25:16.306 --> 25:17.724
[shouting]

25:21.394 --> 25:22.687
[Savannah Rose] Mommy!

25:22.771 --> 25:24.356
Mommy, help me!

25:24.773 --> 25:27.400
I'm in the evil fortress!

25:28.276 --> 25:31.363
Savannah Rose, Mommy's coming!

25:33.031 --> 25:33.907
I tell you,

25:33.990 --> 25:38.370
the view from this evil fortress
is just spectacular.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.705
We are not here for the view.

25:40.789 --> 25:45.710
We are here to guard American girl child.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.463
That is our only job.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.550
-I have to go to the restroom.
-Yep.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.057
[yawns]

26:00.433 --> 26:05.522
The air sure is thin up here
in the mountains.

26:07.524 --> 26:11.611
Beautiful.
<i>I didn't always want to be a terrorist.</i>

26:13.613 --> 26:17.867
<i>Once, I wanted to be a dancer.</i>

26:17.951 --> 26:19.953

-What? I blinked.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.022
-It was just one long blink.

Liberty Belle!

27:43.578 --> 27:44.954
[Savannah Rose] <i>Mommy!</i>

27:55.590 --> 27:59.886
Hold on, Savannah, I'm coming. [grunts]

28:00.595 --> 28:01.846
Looking for this?

28:02.639 --> 28:04.182
[Savannah Rose, on recording]
<i>Help me!</i>

28:06.851 --> 28:08.228
Where is she?

28:08.311 --> 28:09.437
Don't worry, she's safe.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.189
In an actual safe with air holes.

28:11.272 --> 28:15.485
I'll give you the combination to the lock
if you defeat me in the ring.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.030
[laughs]

28:20.490 --> 28:22.575
[blows]

28:22.659 --> 28:26.329
[Bash] And she's blowing the horn of war.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.457
That means this match will be
to the death.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.750
[bell rings]

28:30.834 --> 28:34.295
[Bash] And here comes Liberty Belle,
wasting no time,

28:34.379 --> 28:37.132
-but Vicky barely feels it.
-Why isn't it working?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.758
[Bash] Practically laughing.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.971
-[Liberty Belle shouts]
-[referee] All right! Let that hair go.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.890
[Bash] The Viking has set course
for destruction!

-[Liberty Belle shouts] Get off me!

28:49.394 --> 28:51.396

28:51.896 --> 28:54.274
[referee] Doesn't wanna quit.
Okay, let's go.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.652
Let that hair go.
I'm gonna start counting. You heard me.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.780
-I'm looking right at you!
-[Liberty Belle yells]

29:03.783 --> 29:06.578
[Bash] Wow, it seems the tables
have turned

29:06.995 --> 29:10.623
as Liberty Belle has Vicky
in the crucifix.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.004
[shrieks] No! [grunts]

29:17.756 --> 29:20.675
-I'm gonna Viking Vag her!
-[referee shouts indistinctly]

29:21.301 --> 29:23.094
[referee] I can't have you
in that corner.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.680
[referee grunts, thuds]

29:25.764 --> 29:29.434
[Bash] And the ref topples down
like a sack of potatoes.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.060
Ref!

29:31.186 --> 29:33.813
-[Fortune Cookie and Beirut shriek]
-[Bash] Wait, what's going on?

29:33.897 --> 29:36.524
Fortune Cookie and Beirut
are approaching the ring!

29:38.985 --> 29:40.695
It's three against one!

29:41.654 --> 29:43.031
That's not fair!

29:43.114 --> 29:45.116
-[laughs]
-[shouting] Please!

29:46.493 --> 29:47.827
-[groans]
-[Beirut shouts]

29:47.911 --> 29:51.206
[Bash] This does not look good
for Liberty Belle.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.375
-[Beirut and Fortune Cookie exclaim]
-[moans]

29:54.709 --> 29:58.046
[Vicky cheering] Yeah!

29:58.129 --> 29:59.172
[shouting]

29:59.672 --> 30:03.051
[Bash] But wait! She's taking
something out of her costume.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.427
Savannah!

30:04.511 --> 30:06.971
-[Bash] It's a picture of Savannah Rose!
-My baby.

30:07.055 --> 30:11.518
[Bash] Oh, what a glorious red, white,
and blue-eyed beauty she is!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.353
[cries] My only picture.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.730
-Give me that. Get her up.
-[Liberty Belle grunts]

30:15.814 --> 30:18.274
[Bash] It seems
Vicky has apprehended said photo.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.986
-[Vicky screams]
-[Bash] No! she's tearing apart the photo!

30:22.821 --> 30:25.281
-She tore the photo!
-[slow-motion screaming]

30:25.365 --> 30:26.658
[Bash] How could you?

30:28.451 --> 30:31.454
-Uh-oh. Here comes payback.
-[Fortune Cookie and Beirut moaning]

30:31.579 --> 30:33.414

-[Fortune Cookie and Beirut groan]

30:33.498 --> 30:35.166
[Bash] Oh! Oh, my God.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.628
Things are completely turning around
for Liberty Belle.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.422
The bad girls looking totally shocked.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.385
They underestimated the power
of a mother's love.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.095
[screams]

30:50.014 --> 30:54.143
[Bash] And the bad girls topple
like a house of cards.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.981
-What's the combination?
-[choking]

30:58.064 --> 30:59.482
Tell me!

31:00.984 --> 31:05.530
[gasping]
It's one, one, one, one,

31:05.613 --> 31:09.200
one, one, two.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.910
One, one, one, one, one, one, two.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.829
[referee]
That's it, that's the match. Winner!

31:12.912 --> 31:15.623
Hold on, Savannah Rose.
I'm coming for you.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.709
[audience cheering]

31:20.003 --> 31:21.671
[Liberty Belle]
One, one, one, one, one, one, two.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.590
One, one, one, one, one, one, two.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.883
[panting] One...

31:25.425 --> 31:28.011
one, one, one, one...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.930
one... two.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.184
-[upbeat music playing]
-Mommy, I missed you.

31:35.268 --> 31:38.187
[Liberty Belle sobbing]
Oh, I missed you, too, baby girl!

31:38.271 --> 31:43.693
And I promise, I'll never let anyone
lock you in a safe ever, ever again!

31:46.696 --> 31:51.492
All the things I will do with new foot
once deformity's no longer.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.619
[monitor beeping]

31:52.702 --> 31:56.039
[Olga] Dance, have pedicure. [chuckles]

31:56.497 --> 31:57.957
Find able-bodied lover.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.170
Paging Mr. Mickey Rourke. [laughs]

32:02.253 --> 32:06.257
[gasps] This operation is... symbol.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.845
This thing I have always wanted
is freedom.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.515
Like finally going to Moscow,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.727
[laughs]
except is actually happening,

32:17.810 --> 32:20.104
and, also, I have already been to Moscow.

32:20.605 --> 32:26.444
And also, we are only two sisters,
not three sisters.

32:27.403 --> 32:30.198
Zoya! Oh, <i>nyet!</i>

32:30.490 --> 32:32.283
[Zoya grunts] Oh, <i>da!</i>

32:32.533 --> 32:37.121
[speaking Russian]

32:37.497 --> 32:39.874
[man] See, Rosalie? I told you.
It's Justine.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.669
I mean, she's dressed as a nurse,
but it's definitely her.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.422
-Jesus fucking Christ.
