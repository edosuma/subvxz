Human wrecking ball!

00:39.561 --> 00:40.866
Why.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.433
Good job, brother!

00:42.477 --> 00:43.869
Thank you!

00:44.435 --> 00:45.784
Tilly, look!

00:45.828 --> 00:47.134
It's the photo album from when

00:47.177 --> 00:48.874
we were growin' up on the farm!

00:48.918 --> 00:50.267
I didn't know we still had this!

00:50.311 --> 00:51.834
Oh, my gosh!

00:51.877 --> 00:53.836
It's cousin Jilly!

00:53.879 --> 00:55.185
Oh man, she and I used to be

00:55.229 --> 00:57.013
thick as thieves
back in the day!

00:57.057 --> 00:58.884
Wonder whatever
happened to her...

00:58.928 --> 01:00.843
Cricket, would you excuse me?

01:00.886 --> 01:02.801
I need to have a word
with Saxon alone.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.586
Sounds good, I'll be here.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.588
Basking in memories!

01:06.631 --> 01:07.980
Okay...

01:08.024 --> 01:11.114
Saxon, I have to tell you
a little secret...

01:11.158 --> 01:13.682
<i>Back when Cricket
and I were young and tiny,</i>

01:13.725 --> 01:15.118
<i>we lived out in the country.</i>

01:15.162 --> 01:17.033
<i>I was as happy as a clam!</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:20.210
<i>But I began to suspect
Cricket was growing bored.</i>

01:20.254 --> 01:22.865
-I'm bored. I'm bored.
-I'm bored. I'm bored.
I'm bored...

01:22.908 --> 01:24.693
<i>That's when
I first got the idea...</i>

01:24.736 --> 01:26.216
<i>If Cricket couldn't find
a new friend,</i>

01:26.260 --> 01:28.305
<i>I'd just have to make him one.</i>

01:28.349 --> 01:31.439
<i>And on that day,
a new kid was born.</i>

01:31.482 --> 01:32.483
Hey.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.311
The name's Jilly.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.444
<i>Cricket bought it right away.</i>

01:36.487 --> 01:38.010
<i>And he was overjoyed to meet</i>

01:38.054 --> 01:40.012
<i>such a unique
and different person!</i>

01:40.056 --> 01:42.667
<i>Overnight, Cousin Jilly became
the cool kid on the farm.</i>

01:42.711 --> 01:44.626
<i>She was daring, took big risks,</i>

01:44.669 --> 01:46.628
<i>and always knew what to say.</i>

01:46.671 --> 01:48.934
Looks to me like
the cat's out of the bag.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.980
Did you just have that planned?!

01:51.023 --> 01:53.025
<i>Jilly taught Cricket
every secret she knew</i>

01:53.069 --> 01:54.723
<i>about the art of being cool.</i>

01:54.766 --> 01:56.681
Wow!

01:56.725 --> 01:58.161
<i>Whenever Jilly stopped by,</i>

01:58.205 --> 02:00.729
<i>she and Cricket
were inseparable...</i>

02:02.209 --> 02:04.863
How did he never
realize Jilly was me?!

02:04.907 --> 02:06.256
Hey, Cricket!

02:06.300 --> 02:08.258
I have something to tell you.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.390
There you are!

02:09.433 --> 02:10.541
I just couldn't stop thinkin'

02:10.565 --> 02:11.740
about how cool it would be

02:11.783 --> 02:13.176
to see Jilly again...

02:13.220 --> 02:16.701
So I'm invitin' her
to come visit us! Whoo!

02:16.745 --> 02:19.051
So anyway,
is "Dearest Cousin,"
too formal...

02:19.095 --> 02:21.010
- Or should I go with
"Salutations"?
- Uh, wha...

02:21.053 --> 02:22.533
Mrgh-!

02:22.577 --> 02:24.013
I couldn't tell him, Saxon.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.189
You saw how happy
Jilly makes Cricket!

02:26.233 --> 02:29.192
I know, it's technically
keepin' up a lie,

02:29.236 --> 02:31.760
but one little visit
couldn't hurt...

02:31.803 --> 02:33.936
I just hope I've
still got it in me.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.287
Come to me!

02:37.809 --> 02:39.594
Jilly!

02:40.638 --> 02:42.727
<i>Same... it's the same.</i>

02:50.996 --> 02:53.434
Heh heh. Still got it.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.308
Hello, Gramma!

02:58.352 --> 02:59.570
Nancy's here!

02:59.614 --> 03:01.050
Hey, wanna soda?

03:01.093 --> 03:03.313
- I'm gonna get a soda.
- I'm good, Nancy. Thanks.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.663
Look at her.
Kickin' her boots around

03:05.707 --> 03:07.665
and actin' like
she owns the place!

03:07.709 --> 03:09.232
Oh, Ma, she's fine.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.016
Hey! You need to
buy more soda.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.409
There's only two left.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.412
Woo-hoo!

03:17.240 --> 03:18.240
I got it!

03:19.808 --> 03:20.896
'Sup, cuz!

03:20.939 --> 03:25.857
C-C-C-C-C-Cousin Jilly!?

03:25.901 --> 03:28.817
Jilly, Jilly, Jilly,
Jilly, Jilly, Jilly, Jilly!

03:28.860 --> 03:31.733
We were just talking about you!

03:31.776 --> 03:33.517
- I know.
- You do?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.780
My cousin senses were tingling.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.348
-They were?!
-How 'bout we...
throw it back

03:38.392 --> 03:40.785
and play some of our
favorite country games?

03:40.829 --> 03:42.874
Yessss!!!

03:42.918 --> 03:45.268
All aboard the Cool Train.
Choo-choo-choo.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.184
Hey, Tilly! Jilly's here!
We'll be outside!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.794
<i>Barry! Barry! B-B-Barry!</i>

03:49.838 --> 03:52.406
<i>Kramo! Don't you know
how to knock?</i>

03:52.449 --> 03:53.842
Heh. Typical Kramo.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.758
Hello, Alice!

03:56.801 --> 03:59.239
Why did I put my boots back on?!

03:59.282 --> 04:00.892
Just one of those days.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.373
<i>- Borge is here!
- Borge!</i>

04:03.417 --> 04:05.027
Ah! That's it!

04:05.984 --> 04:08.073
You're gettin'
too comfortable, Nancy!

04:08.117 --> 04:12.164
This ain't your home.
You are a guest in <i>my</i> house!

04:12.208 --> 04:14.863
Excuse me?! I'm not a guest!

04:14.906 --> 04:16.299
You don't live here,

04:16.343 --> 04:18.170
and you sure as heck
don't do any chores!

04:18.214 --> 04:20.303
So yes, you're a guest!

04:21.043 --> 04:24.481
Well, if I'm a guest,
that makes you the host.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.136
And a good host takes care
of her guest, am I right?

04:27.179 --> 04:30.095
And this <i>guest...
wants some tea.</i>

04:30.139 --> 04:32.097
Bah, gah, agh, uh...

04:32.141 --> 04:33.360
Dangit, I got wrecked.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.971
Wa-pow! Pow pow pow pow!
Kick!

04:36.014 --> 04:37.973
Good ol' karat-<i>hay!</i>

04:38.016 --> 04:39.714
You were always good with puns!

04:39.757 --> 04:41.803
Need help defeating
your hay-bale ninjas?

04:41.846 --> 04:44.022
Oh, no, I don't need violence.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.479
I peer-pressured the hay ninjas
into self-destructive behavior.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.897
They dropped out of school
to start a rock n' roll band.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.247
Of course, you did!
So cool!

04:51.291 --> 04:53.336
We gotta show Tilly!
Hey, where is she, anyway?

04:53.380 --> 04:55.991
Tilly! Tilly,
come play with us!

04:56.034 --> 04:57.906
- Hey, Cricket, I'm here!
- Tilly!

04:57.949 --> 04:59.603
You'll never believe
who came to visit!

04:59.647 --> 05:01.431
Wait, where'd Jilly go?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.955
I just passed her in the house.
She's getting a snack.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.610
She said you were playing
"dank" games?

05:06.654 --> 05:09.178
Yes! You gotta
come play with us!

05:09.221 --> 05:11.093
Uh... okay.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.748
<i>♪ Limbo, limbo, limbo!
Limbo, limbo, limbo! ♪</i>

05:13.791 --> 05:15.576
Jilly, you're back!

05:17.404 --> 05:18.579
Ah-choo!

05:18.622 --> 05:20.581
Tilly, you're back! Ow!

05:21.277 --> 05:22.757
Aaaaah...

05:22.800 --> 05:23.758
Ahh!

05:23.801 --> 05:25.455
Aaah!

05:25.499 --> 05:27.239
Push me, Jilly!

05:27.283 --> 05:28.371
Push me, Tilly!

05:28.937 --> 05:31.548
This is the best day ever!

05:31.592 --> 05:34.159
Self care. Oh, yeah.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.597
- Your tea.
- Thank you!

05:38.033 --> 05:39.991
Oh, dear. It's too cold!

05:40.035 --> 05:42.167
Would you be a good host
and heat it up for me?

05:45.301 --> 05:46.955
Much better.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.957
I don't know what to do, Saxon!

05:49.000 --> 05:51.655
I don't know how much longer
I can keep up this secret!

05:52.439 --> 05:54.223
Don't judge me!

05:54.266 --> 05:56.747
I know lying
to Cricket is wrong,

05:56.791 --> 05:57.966
but he'd be heartbroken

05:58.009 --> 05:59.533
if he found out
Jilly isn't real.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.361
I'm doing this
to make him happy!

06:02.187 --> 06:05.495
What do you mean
"this isn't the real reason
I'm doing this"?!

06:05.539 --> 06:07.323
Tilly!
Tilly, you in there?!

06:07.367 --> 06:08.368
Just a second!

06:08.411 --> 06:11.675
I'm takin' a nap!

06:11.719 --> 06:13.068
Oh, good idea!

06:13.111 --> 06:15.984
Always nice to get in
a soothing, relaxing nap.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.942
Takin' a little me time!

06:17.986 --> 06:19.857
All right,
I'll get out of your hair!

06:19.901 --> 06:21.642
I'll talk to you later, Tilly!

06:21.685 --> 06:23.687
Jilly! There you are!

06:23.731 --> 06:26.298
Tilly's just takin' a nap.
Best not to disturb her.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.170
Coolio. Let's, uh...

06:28.213 --> 06:29.954
Let's get back
to playing outside.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.392
All aboard the Cool Train!
Choo-choo!

06:33.131 --> 06:34.611
You know, it's weird...

06:34.655 --> 06:37.353
You two never really
play... together.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.659
Yes we do!

06:38.702 --> 06:40.356
Oh, I see what's going on here.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.446
All these years,
I never realized the truth...

06:43.490 --> 06:46.928
Even though it was
right in front of my face!

06:46.971 --> 06:49.887
You two are never
together because...

06:50.366 --> 06:52.237
Y'all don't get along!

06:52.281 --> 06:53.717
Yes.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.980
I won't stand for this.
You two are family!

06:56.024 --> 06:58.287
It's my responsibility
to fix this.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.028
Wake up, Tilly, Jilly's here!

07:00.071 --> 07:02.223
Now, no one's leaving here until
you put aside your differences

07:02.247 --> 07:03.771
and... Work. It. Out.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.773
Mm-mm!

07:05.816 --> 07:07.514
Uh, Tilly?!

07:08.819 --> 07:10.604
Hey, wake up!

07:10.647 --> 07:12.214
I heard you don't like me!

07:12.257 --> 07:13.694
Whoa-oh!

07:13.737 --> 07:16.087
- No I don't!
- I knew it!

07:16.131 --> 07:18.481
And the thing that
I don't like is that... Ooh!

07:18.525 --> 07:21.092
Let me start.
We are two people.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.833
Two very different people!

07:22.877 --> 07:26.097
It's like you're a totally
different, separate person!

07:26.141 --> 07:28.883
Oh, boy!
Who do I root for?!

07:31.015 --> 07:31.973
Drama!

07:32.016 --> 07:33.975
There they are!

07:35.498 --> 07:37.457
They're equally matched!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.763
You always chew with
your mouth open
and I'm sick of it!

07:39.807 --> 07:41.635
Well, you talk in your sleep!

07:41.678 --> 07:43.550
Yeah, because
I'm havin' nightmares

07:43.593 --> 07:44.638
about your chewin'!

07:44.681 --> 07:46.814
These things distinguish us!

07:46.857 --> 07:48.337
Well, that settles it!

07:48.380 --> 07:50.358
We're just not meant to be
in the same room together!

07:50.382 --> 07:52.428
I guess you'll just
have to go your way,

07:52.472 --> 07:53.777
and I'll go mine!

07:53.821 --> 07:55.387
What? No! No!

07:55.431 --> 07:57.738
We'll just never see
each other again!

07:57.781 --> 07:59.696
- Fine!
- Fine!

07:59.740 --> 08:01.829
Stop!

08:01.872 --> 08:03.265
You're both cool people

08:03.308 --> 08:04.962
with different strengths
and weaknesses!

08:05.006 --> 08:07.878
Can't you acknowledge
one another with a hug?!

08:07.922 --> 08:11.795
- Uh, actually,
no we can't, because...
- Because...

08:11.839 --> 08:14.058
I'm not leaving till
you show each other you...

08:16.060 --> 08:19.150
Uh, what am I...?
What am I seeing...?

08:19.194 --> 08:20.543
What...?
Okay, what is...?

08:20.587 --> 08:22.502
What you're seein', Cricket...

08:22.545 --> 08:24.025
Is that Jilly ain't real.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.940
It's been me the whole time.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.899
- Hey, Jilly!
- No! Watch closely.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.904
Oh, my gosh!
No, Tilly is... But...

08:33.948 --> 08:35.776
Jilly is... Gah!

08:35.819 --> 08:37.821
<i>Tilly... Jilly...</i>

08:37.865 --> 08:40.694
You lied to me this whole time?!

08:40.737 --> 08:42.870
Yeah, but it was pretty obvious.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.306
I'm sorry, Cricket.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.700
Cool cool, just giving
my brain a second

08:46.743 --> 08:49.703
to process the fact
that Jilly was never real.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.621
Oh, no.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.929
Your... cookies...

08:58.973 --> 09:00.496
Thank you, Madam Host.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.064
But sadly, my arms
are too heavy from all this

09:03.107 --> 09:04.979
old jewelry you've given me.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.894
Would you be a dear
and feed me one of them?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.025
Aaah...

09:09.984 --> 09:11.376
And that'll do it!

09:11.420 --> 09:13.117
Bake your own cookies, woman!

09:13.161 --> 09:14.902
Isn't that forbidden?

09:14.945 --> 09:16.599
Because I'm a <i>guest?</i>

09:16.643 --> 09:18.122
All right, fine!

09:18.166 --> 09:20.864
I suppose you're not just
a guest in this home.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.866
Your the mother of my grandkids,

09:22.910 --> 09:24.694
and I suppose that
means you're...

09:24.738 --> 09:27.523
A member of this family...

09:27.567 --> 09:30.308
However! Could ya knock
once in a while?!

09:30.352 --> 09:33.050
- And not kick
your boots everywhere?
- Fair point.

09:33.094 --> 09:36.924
I'll do better about being more
respectful of your home. Deal?

09:36.967 --> 09:40.014
Deal. Just don't track any mud
if you wanna keep that hand.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.973
Goodbye, Jilly.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.149
- Hey, Cricket.
- Oh. It's you.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.674
Got another new character
to trick me with?

09:47.717 --> 09:49.806
Maybe Willy or Millie?

09:49.850 --> 09:52.766
Look, I'm real sorry for
deceiving you for so long.

09:52.809 --> 09:53.941
But you gotta understand,

09:54.637 --> 09:56.789
the whole reason I came up
with Jilly was for your sake!

09:56.813 --> 10:00.034
Hmph. Sounds like just
another one of your lies.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.298
You're right. It is a lie.

10:03.341 --> 10:06.431
I don't think I brought back
Jilly just for you.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.520
All those adventures
we used to have?

10:08.564 --> 10:09.652
I miss 'em, too.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
So I wanted to keep it going

10:11.175 --> 10:13.047
while you still believed
she was real.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.484
Well, maybe...
she is real.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.878
- She's a part of you,
ain't she?
- I guess so.

10:17.921 --> 10:21.533
In fact, I still have that
letter I wrote to Jilly today.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.318
You think I could
read it to her?

10:23.361 --> 10:24.885
Let's blow it up, bruh.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.713
"Dear, Cousin Jilly.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.802
Hello. This is
your cousin, Cricket.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.847
<i>I'm currently
living in Big City,</i>

10:30.891 --> 10:32.588
<i>where the air is stinky,</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:34.131
<i>and they carry their dogs
around in purses.</i>

10:34.155 --> 10:35.983
<i>How are things
back in the country?</i>

10:36.026 --> 10:37.626
<i>Tilly and I were talking
about you today,</i>

10:37.898 --> 10:39.136
<i>and it brought back memories
of all the adventures</i>

10:39.160 --> 10:40.857
<i>we had when we were little.</i>

10:40.901 --> 10:42.511
<i>I believe those
adventures shaped me</i>

10:42.554 --> 10:44.818
<i>into the well-molded
gentleman I am today!</i>

10:44.861 --> 10:46.733
<i>We'd love to have you
visit sometime!</i>

10:46.776 --> 10:48.952
<i>Just knock first, or
Gramma will try to bite you.</i>

10:48.996 --> 10:51.128
<i>But if you're not able to,
I understand.</i>

10:51.172 --> 10:53.478
<i>Just write me back
and let me know you're good.</i>

10:53.522 --> 10:55.959
<i>No matter what, thanks for
makin' my life back then</i>

10:56.003 --> 10:57.918
<i>so full of great memories.</i>

10:57.961 --> 11:01.443
<i>Love, your city-slicker
cousin, Cricket Green."</i>
