00:26.201 --> 00:30.339
<i>Doesn't it always start
with a girl and the guy in a bar?</i>

00:30.372 --> 00:32.541
<i>But did you ever think,</i>

00:32.574 --> 00:35.544
<i>"Hey, maybe that's the wrong girl
and maybe that's the wrong guy?"</i>

00:35.578 --> 00:37.145
<i>Actually, you know what?</i>

00:37.179 --> 00:39.649
<i>I think they're perfect
for each other,</i>

00:39.682 --> 00:42.150
<i>but you can't hide
from who you really are</i>

00:42.184 --> 00:44.754
<i>any more than the moon
can hide from the sun.</i>

00:44.787 --> 00:47.489
<i>I mean think about it.</i>

00:47.522 --> 00:50.660
<i>If you're a selfish person you could
try and duck behind a cloud or whatever,</i>

00:50.693 --> 00:53.528
<i>but eventually who you are
is gonna shine through.</i>

00:53.562 --> 00:57.466
<i>If you're an angry person,
everybody knows an angry person.</i>

00:57.499 --> 01:00.637
<i>Can they hide? I don't think so.</i>

01:00.670 --> 01:02.939
<i>And if you're
a passionate person,</i>

01:02.972 --> 01:07.175
<i>that passion's just gonna shine
all over everybody.</i>

01:07.209 --> 01:11.614
<i>So maybe all you gotta do
is just step out of the shadows.</i>

01:11.648 --> 01:13.916
<i>You never know
who might see you.</i>

01:19.254 --> 01:21.624
You know what, fellas?
I'mma tell you what it is, okay?

01:21.658 --> 01:24.794
And it's gonna sound crazy,
whatever, alright?

01:24.827 --> 01:27.362
But it's that
freaking lunar eclipse tonight.

01:28.397 --> 01:32.534
You're sayin' that Miranda left
Pete here stranded at the altar,

01:32.567 --> 01:34.837
because the moon controls her?

01:34.871 --> 01:38.240
You know how you say that the moon
controls the tides and stuff, right?

01:38.273 --> 01:41.410
Well, I saw this thing where
it also controls your emotions.

01:41.443 --> 01:44.681
Or perhaps she's just a bitch.

01:44.714 --> 01:48.450
- I mean that goes without sayin'.
- Not helping! Not helping.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.452
- You're not helping.
- Sorry, man.

01:53.355 --> 01:56.391
Y... you know,
you know what the worst part is?

01:56.425 --> 01:59.294
It's... it's the looks.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.833
You know, you... you got everyone that
you know, your friends and family,

02:03.866 --> 02:06.301
and they won't even look you
in the eye anymore.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.371
It's like you have a disease
or something's wrong with you.

02:11.373 --> 02:13.609
That's what I'm talkin' about!
That, right there!

02:13.643 --> 02:16.411
- We were lookin' at...
- That, that, yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about!

02:16.445 --> 02:17.714
Oh.

02:17.747 --> 02:21.918
Listen, man,
I'm just gonna say it.

02:21.951 --> 02:24.654
Um, I'm... I'm sorry I... I've...
I've sat on this for so long,

02:24.687 --> 02:26.288
you can hit me afterwards.

02:26.321 --> 02:28.490
In fact, I want you
to hit me afterwards.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.792
- Man, just go ahead and say it, please.
- I deserve it.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.928
- Slap me, kick me.
- Can you just blurt it out, bro?

02:31.961 --> 02:33.462
- I never liked her.
- Yes, bingo.

02:33.495 --> 02:35.698
- Never liked her.
- Yes, sir.

02:35.732 --> 02:38.366
The way that she treats you, the way that
she talks to you, looks down on you...

02:38.400 --> 02:40.435
- All the time.
- Contradicts you, condescends you,

02:40.469 --> 02:42.672
she drags you down, and she
takes your underpants off,

02:42.705 --> 02:45.407
and leaves you standing there
naked in front of your own mates.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.010
She's such garbage, man. I mean I
wouldn't do that to my worst enemy

02:48.044 --> 02:50.479
and I hate everybody
for the most part.

02:50.512 --> 02:54.984
Pete, you are such a beautiful, blue-eyed,
redheaded woodpecker who used to fly.

02:55.017 --> 02:58.353
- Hmm.
- You're like a shadow of your former self.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.657
Brother, she's holding you back.

03:01.691 --> 03:06.028
Oh, my gosh! I wish I could just
like go somewhere away from everyone,

03:06.062 --> 03:08.363
but with someone who...
who has no idea who I am, just s...

03:08.396 --> 03:10.066
- You said that the, um...
- (sighs)

03:10.099 --> 03:11.868
...hotel room was paid for,
right?

03:11.901 --> 03:14.871
- Tonight, by the in-laws.
- Yeah, it's paid for.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.672
- So what?
- Well, come here.

03:16.706 --> 03:18.975
I wanna tell you
somethin' real quick. Uh...

03:21.110 --> 03:22.912
- Let's just...
- I've got a good idea.

03:22.945 --> 03:23.980
- ...see what the hell's goin' on, man.
- Good idea!

03:24.013 --> 03:25.882
Who knows?
He may have an answer to somethin'.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.522
Okay, hotel room?

03:33.555 --> 03:34.991
Okay. Alright.

03:35.024 --> 03:40.395
So I'm saying that
you should use the hotel.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.098
Yeah, that... that sounds great.
How... how about this?

03:42.131 --> 03:45.067
How about I go sit in a hotel
room by myself on my honeymoon?

03:45.101 --> 03:51.941
Oh, I didn't say sit, nor did I
say by yourself, I said use it.

03:53.508 --> 03:56.012
- Use it?
- No.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.780
Yes, just... just zip that.

03:57.814 --> 04:00.650
- This guy that I know, right?
- Hmm.

04:00.683 --> 04:03.986
He knows these models, he shoots
them, he's a photographer.

04:04.020 --> 04:07.355
Sometimes these models get a
little bit hard up for cash, right?

04:07.389 --> 04:12.360
And they are willing to do whatever
it takes to make ends meet, let's say.

04:12.394 --> 04:15.965
They'll spend the night
and do anythin'.

04:15.998 --> 04:19.769
Now, you... when you say
anything, now, do you mean that...

04:19.802 --> 04:22.672
- Sex.
- Okay, we... we gettin' our boy Pete a hooker?

04:22.705 --> 04:24.106
A model.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.441
How about this?
How about no hooker for Pete?

04:26.474 --> 04:29.544
- No hooker, model.
- Tomayto, tomahto, man. Whatever.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.914
Tomayto, tomahto.
That's, mm, playin' words.

04:31.948 --> 04:33.716
That's... that was...
that was great.

04:33.749 --> 04:35.918
I'm not talkin' of bus station
skank here, my friend.

04:35.952 --> 04:39.856
No, siree Bob. I'm talkin' about
gorgeous elegant ladies of the night.

04:39.889 --> 04:43.626
Ah, elegant.
That sounds so good, don't it?

04:43.659 --> 04:49.165
They're not cheap either.
They're at least um, 13, 14, or $1,500.

04:49.198 --> 04:52.068
- Fifteen-hundred.
- You're... Yeah, that's great.

04:52.101 --> 04:54.436
Let me... let me
pull out my $1,500 here.

04:54.469 --> 04:56.072
I don't have $1,500.
Are you crazy?

04:56.105 --> 04:59.541
Maybe I am,
but you know what's crazier?

04:59.574 --> 05:04.479
It's you standin' in this toilet on what is
supposed to be the happiest day of your life.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.048
Have a look around.

05:06.082 --> 05:09.451
Does this look like
the happiest day of your life?

05:09.484 --> 05:13.421
- No, sir, it doesn't.
- No, it doesn't. Thank you, Chucky.

05:13.455 --> 05:15.791
Pete, I'm sorry
that she didn't love you.

05:16.826 --> 05:18.628
I am.

05:18.661 --> 05:21.898
And you know what?
We love you.

05:21.931 --> 05:25.533
And that's why we're here.
We do not want to see you hurt.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.738
We're tryin' to
fix things a little bit.

05:28.771 --> 05:30.840
- Pete, do it for yourself...
- Do it for you.

05:30.873 --> 05:36.078
And if you don't do it for
yourself, well, please do it for me.

05:36.112 --> 05:38.513
I'm begging you.

05:40.182 --> 05:43.719
Okay, I have like 650
from the honeymoon. That's...

05:43.753 --> 05:46.889
- There we go. Cash. - Now, we're startin' now...
- We're movin' forward.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.925
- This is what we're talkin' about. Okay, great.
- Okay.

05:48.958 --> 05:52.128
I've got $50. So okay,
650 plus 50, that's 700.

05:52.161 --> 05:54.597
- And I got 200 in. I got 200.
- Two-hundred from Chucky.

05:54.630 --> 05:56.933
- Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Seven.

05:56.966 --> 06:00.036
Eight. Is that eight?
Um, yeah.

06:00.069 --> 06:04.607
So that's not exactly where we need to be, but
we're definitely movin' in the right direction.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.142
Maybe get you a
discount chick or somethin'?

06:06.175 --> 06:07.509
- Whoa, man!
- What?

06:07.542 --> 06:09.812
Have you got a coupon that you're
gonna throw in or somethin'.

06:09.845 --> 06:12.148
Maybe your mom's
up for givin' him a pop?

06:12.181 --> 06:14.951
Oh, now it's my mom, douche! Wow,
we're goin' moms now? How original is that?

06:14.984 --> 06:16.953
I'm just sayin'.

06:16.986 --> 06:18.187
Discount chick
is not the way to go.

06:18.220 --> 06:20.656
- I get it. We won't do a discount, okay?
- Do you get it?

06:20.690 --> 06:24.160
- Why did you even bring it up?
- Dude, no discount.

06:24.193 --> 06:26.128
- There's no discount.
- Yeah. - Okay.

06:26.162 --> 06:28.130
- No discount.
- Guys, I... - Jeez.

06:28.164 --> 06:30.833
...appreciate it,
but, uh, we're like what?

06:30.866 --> 06:35.604
That's probably $700 short, so barring
a miracle, it's not gonna happen.

06:35.638 --> 06:37.539
Thank you very much.

06:37.572 --> 06:40.876
Hmm, we do need a miracle.

06:40.910 --> 06:42.211
True, true.

06:44.981 --> 06:46.215
Hello?

06:47.116 --> 06:48.651
Uh, hello?

06:52.655 --> 06:55.291
We could totally sell the tuxes,
resell 'em.

06:55.324 --> 06:57.860
We paid like 200 bucks
for 'em, right?

06:57.893 --> 07:00.196
No,
we... we... we rented the tuxes.

07:00.229 --> 07:02.898
We... we don't own the tuxes.
You have to take that tux back.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.967
Dude, where's your jacket?

07:05.901 --> 07:09.705
- Don't worry. Oh.
- Don't worry. Love.

07:09.739 --> 07:12.942
Mad love all day, every day.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.043
- Love.
- Love.

07:14.076 --> 07:15.578
- Yep.
- Well.

07:16.278 --> 07:18.280
I don't know why I love you,
but...

07:19.248 --> 07:21.717
- Uh, deuces.
- No, no, no, no, no. - What?

07:21.751 --> 07:24.687
You ain't goin' nowhere, mate.
No, no, no, you're staying with us today.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.656
- Yeah.
- No, no. I'm gonna turn that frown upside down.

07:29.058 --> 07:31.060
Well, that is peculiar.

07:31.093 --> 07:32.795
That's right in time, innit?

07:32.828 --> 07:34.030
And talk about bein' tardy.

07:34.063 --> 07:36.198
Last one in first one out.

07:36.232 --> 07:41.604
Yeah, well, thank you for bringin'
that up again, no one's here, so...

07:41.637 --> 07:44.240
- Um, sorry.
- Well, okay.

07:44.273 --> 07:46.909
- Hey, Mr. Johnson.
- Hey, Pete.

07:46.942 --> 07:49.245
Look at you, you look terrific.

07:49.278 --> 07:52.848
Hey, you... you better get in that church
or you're gonna miss your own wedding.

07:54.283 --> 07:58.788
Uh, yeah, I... I think
it's... it's probably over.

07:58.821 --> 08:02.224
Oh, I... I...
I got you a present.

08:02.258 --> 08:08.931
Uh, it's just a picture
frame that says family on it.

08:08.964 --> 08:11.767
Maybe now you should return it

08:11.801 --> 08:16.806
and use the money to buy yourself
something that you really want.

08:16.839 --> 08:18.974
Now, don't go
buying anything crazy.

08:19.008 --> 08:22.878
- Okay, thank you, again.
- You boys, behave yourselves.

08:22.912 --> 08:24.747
Alright, thank you, Mr. Johnson.

08:28.684 --> 08:31.320
What are you doin'? Just...
No, go ahead and open my present, right.

08:31.353 --> 08:33.989
- What are you doin'?
- I'm looking for something.

08:35.057 --> 08:38.694
It's a picture frame.
Um...

08:43.265 --> 08:44.934
A miracle.

08:48.337 --> 08:51.740
Come on. Yo, yo, yo, yo!

- Yeah.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.769
Known you for a long time, mate.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.437
You're havin' second thoughts.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.273
- I'm... I'm... I'm good. I'm...
- Yes, you are. - I'm not.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.207
- You're overthinkin' it.
- Mm-mm.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.409
Man, do not think, okay?

10:00.442 --> 10:03.179
Nothing goods comes
out of people thinking, alright?

10:03.212 --> 10:06.282
- Please.
- Listen, you deserve this.

10:07.216 --> 10:12.254
You, my friend, are worth every single red cent
of this after what she put you through today.

10:12.288 --> 10:14.957
Today has been awesome.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.959
I think I've even seen
you smile a couple of times.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.228
- Did you seen him smile?
- I saws a plenty of enamel.

10:19.261 --> 10:21.297
At least a couple of times.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.933
Just give me the money, please.
No speeches, just give me the money.

10:23.966 --> 10:25.734
- There you go. That's a little gift to you...
- Okay.

10:25.768 --> 10:27.236
- ...from you.
- Okay, thank you.

10:27.269 --> 10:32.274
Along with phone number
from mademoiselle,

10:32.308 --> 10:34.476
who would love to see you tonight
and take care of your needs.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.078
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:36.111 --> 10:38.013
Oh, my gosh, you guys are crazy.
Get out of here.

10:38.047 --> 10:39.181
- Call the number, man.
- Good luck.

10:39.215 --> 10:41.083
- No follows.
- No, no.

10:41.116 --> 10:43.252
If you don't call the number,
I will go to the hotel room,

10:43.285 --> 10:46.055
I will sneak underneath the bed to
make sure you go through with it, okay?

10:46.088 --> 10:48.090
- He'll do it, too.
- Under the bed. Breakfast for three, I got it.

10:48.123 --> 10:49.825
That's right,
it can get awkward, okay?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.794
- And not for me, for you.
- Right, I got it.

10:51.827 --> 10:55.130
Okay, I love you guys.
I'm leaving!

10:55.164 --> 10:57.032
You aren't following.

10:57.066 --> 10:59.368
Well, we might follow
if we don't see you send.

10:59.401 --> 11:02.104
- I'm tryin' to tell you.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:08.544 --> 11:13.816
Okay, guys. Are you guys gonna shut up now?

14:11.994 --> 14:14.196
Um, Pete.

14:15.264 --> 14:17.634
Mm-hmm-hmm, mm.

14:17.667 --> 14:20.670
Do you want me to come in?

14:22.739 --> 14:26.275
Mm...

14:33.415 --> 14:37.419
- Um, you... you look really nice.
- Thanks.

14:38.755 --> 14:41.056
Um, you too, a tux, wow.

14:41.089 --> 14:45.561
So um, let's... you know, I
wanna make sure that... that...

14:45.595 --> 14:51.400
that we're, uh, straight
on this whole, uh, money thing.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.569
It's 1,500.

14:53.603 --> 14:58.507
- Do you... do you normally like get all the money up front or...
- Up front.

15:00.509 --> 15:03.011
Here's the thing, I... I, uh...

15:03.045 --> 15:05.080
I'm sure you're a trustworthy
person and all,

15:05.113 --> 15:08.150
it's... it's... it's just that,
you know,

15:08.183 --> 15:12.488
if I give you all the money
up front,

15:12.521 --> 15:17.125
then you could just leave
whenever you wanted to, right?

15:17.159 --> 15:21.664
Look, it's 1,500
up front or I can leave.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.233
So...

15:27.569 --> 15:29.606
Okay, well, that settles that.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.442
Thank goodness.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.578
- What did you say?
- Huh?

15:36.545 --> 15:38.080
You said "thank goodness".

15:38.781 --> 15:41.416
I did?

15:41.450 --> 15:44.119
- Your friend Ronnie called me, remember?
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.321
And now you act like
you can't wait until I go.

15:46.355 --> 15:49.224
I mean I... I come in here, and you've
got chocolate-covered strawberries

15:49.258 --> 15:51.560
and roses all over the room,

15:51.594 --> 15:57.299
I mean that's kind of creepy by the
way, like duffel bag creepy, so what?

15:57.332 --> 15:59.568
Do you want me to stay
or do you want me to go?

16:01.136 --> 16:04.841
Uh, you think maybe we could just
like hang out or something for...

16:04.874 --> 16:07.042
No.

16:08.310 --> 16:11.547
I...

16:14.116 --> 16:16.719
truthfully just don't
wanna be alone tonight.

16:28.263 --> 16:31.466
So here's my offer, okay?

16:31.500 --> 16:36.271
I will give you $700 up front

16:36.305 --> 16:40.777
and then $100 for every hour
you spend with me.

16:40.810 --> 16:45.380
You'll give me 700 right
now and then 100 each hour?

16:45.414 --> 16:47.182
Yeah.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.455
Sorry about the roses.

16:56.893 --> 17:01.631
And I forgot my duffel bag, so you're
gonna have to fit in my backpack.

17:04.701 --> 17:06.468
It's funny.

17:07.804 --> 17:09.438
Impressive.

17:33.362 --> 17:35.698
I gotta go to the bathroom.

17:49.612 --> 17:53.248
Come on, come on, come on, man.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.259
Um, are you okay in there?

18:04.292 --> 18:06.395
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

18:09.264 --> 18:10.833
What is that?

18:15.337 --> 18:17.172
You say you
were here on business?

18:18.507 --> 18:21.510
Uh, yeah.
Uh, somethin' like that.

18:23.746 --> 18:26.248
You sure you're okay in there?

18:26.281 --> 18:28.851
Uh, yeah, yeah,
everything's good.

18:28.885 --> 18:34.791
You're good, buddy.
You are good.

18:34.824 --> 18:36.458
Okay.

18:37.593 --> 18:38.861
Be a man.

18:40.429 --> 18:42.330
Phew!

18:43.298 --> 18:47.235
Mm. I'm sorry,
they looked really good.

18:47.269 --> 18:50.505
No, uh, are you hungry?
Do you want somethin' to eat?

18:50.539 --> 18:51.941
We can...
we can get somethin' to eat.

18:51.974 --> 18:54.777
Let's... let's get somethin'
to eat, okay?

18:54.811 --> 18:56.478
- Okay.
- That'd be great.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.848
Well,
let's get somethin' to eat.

- Hi. - Good evening.

19:22.772 --> 19:25.808
We have the same haircut.

19:25.842 --> 19:31.581
I'm Wilma and I am here
to take your order.

19:31.614 --> 19:33.348
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry, there we go.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.817
Thanks.

19:34.851 --> 19:38.721
Tonight's special
is the lunar eggs-clipse.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.489
Oh, what's that?

19:40.522 --> 19:43.726
It's basically a sunny-side-up
egg on top of a waffle.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.795
Oh, yeah, so I... I get it.

19:45.828 --> 19:49.832
So like the... the egg is actually
eclipsing, uh, the waffle.

19:49.866 --> 19:53.669
There's a lunar eclipse tonight.

19:53.703 --> 19:55.805
Ah, okay, yes.

19:57.039 --> 20:00.042
I get it now.
Yeah, that makes me... Wow.

20:00.076 --> 20:03.846
I... I think I want the special,
uh, with a glass of OJ, please.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.682
I, uh, would not
love the special,

20:06.716 --> 20:10.953
uh, but I would... I'd like some
toast, uh, no butter, please,

20:10.987 --> 20:15.323
but I'd like apple butter on the
side, coffee, and, uh, some grits,

20:15.357 --> 20:18.694
but just have those,
uh, dry with...

20:19.829 --> 20:22.865
Do... do you wanna like write
any of this down?

20:22.899 --> 20:25.367
- Oh, no.
- She's good.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.070
- I got it.
- She has it.

20:28.104 --> 20:32.541
- Um, okay, so I'll have the eggs scrambled.
- Hmm.

20:32.574 --> 20:35.011
No cheese.

20:35.044 --> 20:38.480
And I don't know if you can do this, but I
like my bacon crispy, no... no limp bacon.

20:39.715 --> 20:41.349
You don't need
to write this down?

20:41.383 --> 20:42.785
- No, I got it.
- She got it. - I'm good.

20:42.819 --> 20:43.920
- Yeah.
- She's good.

20:43.953 --> 20:45.520
- I'll get these.
- Mm-hmm.

20:45.554 --> 20:48.958
- And I will get your drinks.
- Thank you.

20:48.991 --> 20:50.492
Okay.

20:51.493 --> 20:54.630
Okay, I am, uh,
definitely screwed. Um...

20:54.664 --> 20:56.065
She could surprise you, though.

20:56.098 --> 20:58.466
- She could surprise me.
- She could.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.872
Yeah, well, you are
very confident with my food.

21:02.905 --> 21:07.509
There you go. If you need anything
else, just call my name.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.878
Thanks, Wilma.

21:08.911 --> 21:10.847
- Thank you, Wilma.
- You're welcome.

21:12.915 --> 21:17.485
So no limp bacon, huh?

21:17.519 --> 21:20.488
I don't like limp bacon.

21:20.522 --> 21:23.059
Yeah, okay.

21:23.092 --> 21:26.829
I like my bacon crispy.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.798
I want my bacon snap...
This is horrible, isn't it?

21:28.831 --> 21:31.701
- - It just sounds horrible.
- Yeah.

21:33.069 --> 21:37.572
So, uh, uh, Heather,
is that your... your real name

21:37.607 --> 21:43.646
or is... is that like one of those
sexy names that they give you?

21:43.679 --> 21:47.549
If by "they" you mean
my parents, then, yeah.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.620
Ooh, sorry.

21:54.590 --> 21:56.491
Why rose petals on the bed?

21:58.294 --> 22:04.466
I mean it's almost as though it was for someone
else and that I was just like a backup plan.

22:08.971 --> 22:13.042
- Uh, what are you doing?
- What? I'm just asking you a question.

22:13.075 --> 22:16.913
Uh, no, you're interrogating me.

22:19.916 --> 22:21.017
Alright.

22:25.855 --> 22:30.525
Does this look crisp to you?
Is that... is that crisp to you?

22:30.558 --> 22:31.994
No, it's not crisp, is it?

22:32.028 --> 22:34.030
You wonder why it's not crisp,
Wilma?

22:34.063 --> 22:36.564
Because you didn't
write it down.

22:36.599 --> 22:38.668
Here's a little
tidbit of information.

22:38.701 --> 22:44.740
When a customer asks you to write
something down, write it down, Wilma.

22:52.281 --> 22:55.685
Don't cry, Wilma.
I'm sorry. Don't...

22:55.718 --> 22:58.921
Don't cry.

22:59.956 --> 23:01.757
Don't, Wilma.

23:04.126 --> 23:07.163
- No, I.,.. I'll eat it.
- He'll eat it, that's fine.

23:07.196 --> 23:10.933
Mmm. Mmm.

23:28.617 --> 23:30.052
You, uh...

23:31.320 --> 23:33.089
You can just go.

23:42.798 --> 23:44.266
I found that.

23:53.776 --> 23:55.144
I, uh...

23:56.278 --> 23:59.615
I was supposed to get
married today.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.717
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no.

24:01.751 --> 24:05.721
It's no big deal, you know?
She just left me stranded at the altar.

24:05.755 --> 24:07.923
All that kind of fun stuff.

24:09.959 --> 24:12.895
Maybe Wilma
could tell you why she left.

24:14.130 --> 24:16.866
Yeah, she's probably not a
good person to ask right now.

24:16.899 --> 24:20.770
No, I did that. That's not me.
I, uh...

24:21.937 --> 24:27.843
I'm no expert, but I'm gonna say that it had
something to do with you being left at the altar.

24:27.877 --> 24:30.579
You know,
the craziest thing is that

24:32.081 --> 24:36.085
you just begin to question your
whole relationship, you know?

24:36.118 --> 24:37.820
Yeah, I know.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.859
Did you love her?

24:47.897 --> 24:49.765
Did you love her?

24:52.735 --> 24:55.071
That's a pause, my friend.

24:57.139 --> 24:59.341
There are no pauses in love.

24:59.375 --> 25:04.180
Hmm, what, uh, Lifetime movie did
you just pick that line up from?

25:04.213 --> 25:05.781
Come on.

25:06.682 --> 25:09.819
It's just today, you know,

25:09.852 --> 25:14.023
was supposed to be the happiest
day of my life.

25:14.056 --> 25:16.625
It's still today.

25:19.328 --> 25:23.999
Does this technically mean we're
on your honeymoon right now?

25:24.033 --> 25:26.402
Yes, it really does.

25:26.435 --> 25:28.237
Wow!

25:28.270 --> 25:31.207
- It is off to a boring start...
- It's...

25:31.240 --> 25:34.877
- ...I would say.
- Yeah, it's the most exciting honeymoon I've ever been on.

25:34.910 --> 25:39.014
Amazing. Tell you what? Since you
are on this honeymoon with me, uh,

25:39.048 --> 25:41.951
I think it is only fair that you
get to pick what we do next.

25:41.984 --> 25:45.221
- Really? - Yeah, why not, right?
- Oh, okay.

25:47.690 --> 25:50.259
- Think about what you wanna do.
- Okay.

25:50.292 --> 25:54.797
And I will be back
in just a second, okay?

26:07.276 --> 26:09.345
I'm sorry.

26:09.378 --> 26:12.715
- Hug?
- Okay.

26:16.886 --> 26:20.322
- Crock pot. Nice touch.
- Thank you, thank you.

26:20.356 --> 26:22.725
- I got you something.
- No, you didn't.

26:22.758 --> 26:24.093
I did, I swear.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.263
- You got to close your eyes.
- Uh, okay.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.398
- Stick your hands out a little bit further.
- Okay.

26:29.431 --> 26:32.134
Awesome, perfect.

26:32.168 --> 26:33.369
Hold it.

26:35.004 --> 26:36.405
Open your eyes.

26:36.438 --> 26:41.010
Oh, God! That's gross!
Uh, okay.

26:41.043 --> 26:44.847
- I think that is one hour down.
- Thank you.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.752
Have you, uh, put any thought to what
you wanna do next for this honeymoon?

26:49.785 --> 26:52.087
Might have a
little somethin' in mind.

26:52.121 --> 26:55.791
- Better than this place?
- It's better.

26:59.929 --> 27:04.166
Alright, alright, ladies
and gentlemen, welcome tonight.

27:04.200 --> 27:09.104
Let's get this show
rollin' or should I say bowlin'?

27:09.138 --> 27:13.008
Ho-ho!
No, he didn't, he did.

27:14.310 --> 27:17.513
- Perfect form.
- Oh!

27:17.546 --> 27:19.215
- Magic, yes.
- Whoo!

27:20.549 --> 27:22.184
- You know what I just realized?
- What?

27:22.218 --> 27:24.753
- I... I really like bowling.
- Yeah.

27:24.787 --> 27:27.823
Yeah, yeah, you know?
I haven't done this in forever.

27:27.856 --> 27:30.993
- Why?
- Uh, Miranda, she hated it.

27:31.026 --> 27:33.095
Really?

27:33.128 --> 27:35.497
Yeah, yeah, she said that any game
that had the word gutter in it,

27:35.531 --> 27:37.266
uh, must be for gutter people.

27:37.299 --> 27:40.302
Wow! She just... she just
sounds so delightful.

27:40.336 --> 27:42.871
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

27:42.905 --> 27:47.476
- Who doesn't like bowling?
- Uh, Miranda.

27:47.509 --> 27:51.347
If these are gutter people,
then they're my kind of people, you know?

27:51.380 --> 27:53.215
And who says gutter people?

27:53.249 --> 27:56.118
Uh, yeah, again,
that would be Miranda.

27:56.151 --> 27:59.355
But, uh, hey,
looks like I'm your people.

29:06.422 --> 29:08.490
We're gonna slow things down
right about now.

29:08.524 --> 29:12.161
This song's for all the lovers,
it should be right up their alley.

29:17.966 --> 29:21.337
Okay, now,
I get to decide what we do next.

29:21.370 --> 29:24.106
No, I... I thought
I was making the decisions.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.909
No, you are not
making the decisions.

29:26.942 --> 29:31.113
- You told me, yeah.
- No, the honeymoon power reverts back to me.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.282
You can't revert the power.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.585
I'm sorry, it's already done,
there's nothing we can do about it.

29:35.618 --> 29:38.554
It's over,
but you're gonna love it.

29:38.588 --> 29:41.123
I don't know.
You picked out the diner.

29:41.156 --> 29:44.026
- It was, mm.
- I did not pick out the diner.

29:44.059 --> 29:47.630
- You... you chose the diner.
- No, that was all you.

29:47.664 --> 29:50.332
No, uh, I thought
it was a mutual thing.

29:50.366 --> 29:52.267
- No.
- Alright, that's fine.

29:52.301 --> 29:54.503
- I, you know, I take responsibility for the diner.
- Okay.

29:54.536 --> 29:56.572
That's fine,
but this you're gonna love.

29:59.408 --> 30:02.645
Do you trust me?

30:03.545 --> 30:05.381
Give me your hand, girl?
Get on uphill.

30:05.414 --> 30:07.116
Okay.

30:07.149 --> 30:09.318
You know what one of my favorite
things about bowling is?

30:09.351 --> 30:11.153
Uh, balls?

30:12.087 --> 30:14.089
- The floor?
- Shoes.

30:14.123 --> 30:15.524
The shoes?

30:15.557 --> 30:17.526
Look at 'em,
they're pretty kick-ass, huh?

30:17.559 --> 30:20.996
They are pretty
kick-ass actually, yes.

30:21.964 --> 30:25.635
You know what?
We're gonna take these shoes.

30:27.236 --> 30:29.438
- What?
- Yeah, they've got a million pair,

30:29.471 --> 30:30.939
they're never gonna notice.

30:30.973 --> 30:33.108
No, I'm not
gonna take the shoes.

30:33.142 --> 30:36.178
What? What do you care?
You came in tux shoes.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.014
It's like trading
one rental for the next.

30:39.047 --> 30:42.985
So are you ready to live
on the wild side, Ponyboy?

30:44.019 --> 30:46.723
- Did you just do an <i>Outsiders</i> reference to me?
- Mm-hmm.

30:46.756 --> 30:50.225
Are you gonna be
a Greaser or a Soc?

30:50.259 --> 30:51.628
You know what?

30:53.262 --> 30:55.698
- I'm gonna be a Greaser?
- Yeah, you are.

30:55.732 --> 30:58.735
Okay, now, I'm gonna distract him
while you go and get my shoes.

30:58.768 --> 31:01.203
What? No!
No, no, no, no, no.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.405
That is...
that's not part of the bargain.

31:03.439 --> 31:06.175
Yeah, I need my shoes.
Those are my favorite shoes!

31:06.208 --> 31:07.443
Oh, I hate that.

31:07.476 --> 31:11.113
Please, please,
be my hero, Ponyboy.

31:11.146 --> 31:12.481
- Uh, just... just...
- Please!

31:12.514 --> 31:15.217
Whatever. Don't call me
Ponyboy again, please.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.219

31:17.252 --> 31:19.988

- How you doin' tonight?
- Oh, good.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.596
- Havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

31:26.629 --> 31:30.132
- I saw you over there sprayin' and...
- You did?

31:30.165 --> 31:33.135
- You're... you're really good.
- Yeah, well, uh, thank you.

31:33.168 --> 31:35.370
You know, a lot of people
don't notice that,

31:35.404 --> 31:39.575
but I appreciate it when beautiful
women like yourself do notice that.

31:39.609 --> 31:43.613
Uh, can I spray one?

31:43.646 --> 31:45.648
Well, how about this?

31:45.682 --> 31:49.318
How about you watch me do it
first and then I'll let you do it?

31:49.351 --> 31:51.386
Here it is.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.590
Alright, you ready?
So you pick the shoe, you get the shoe.

You go right in there, lift and pow!
That's a quick job.

32:01.096 --> 32:02.599
Hang on. You know what?

32:02.632 --> 32:05.200
I don't usually
let people do this.

32:06.636 --> 32:08.003
- Go on ahead.
- Whoo!

32:08.036 --> 32:10.539
Yeah, give it a shot. Now,
you hold it and that's the business in.

32:10.572 --> 32:12.474
And you take this here shoe.

32:12.508 --> 32:14.343
Yeah, alright, maybe...
maybe a little closer.

32:14.376 --> 32:16.345
Alright, yeah, that's good.

32:16.378 --> 32:19.081
Okay. Oh, now, you're gonna... a lot...
Hey, don't spray it in there.

- Your lane is open. Oof.

32:44.373 --> 32:46.508
- There is no...
- I have a song for you.

32:46.542 --> 32:47.710
I don't wanna hear a song,
ma'am.

- Oh, whoo!

32:52.815 --> 32:54.550
- I need you to...
- Y'all have been great!

32:54.584 --> 32:56.586
- No.
- Thank you, good night and God bless.

32:56.619 --> 32:58.487
- I need you to get down.
- Whoo!

32:58.520 --> 33:01.591
Okay. Alright.

33:01.624 --> 33:03.458
Thank you for coming.

33:03.492 --> 33:06.696
He has no clue that we took those.

33:06.729 --> 33:09.866
That is like amazing.
You earned every penny of this.

33:09.899 --> 33:11.768
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome very much.

33:11.801 --> 33:14.202
Unfortunately, you gotta go back
in there and apologize to him.

33:14.236 --> 33:16.438
- No, I'm not going back in there.
- Yes, get back in there!

33:16.471 --> 33:18.608
- I apologized to Wilma!
- Okay, you have a toaster in your trunk?

33:18.641 --> 33:21.176
- I'll give him a toaster.
- I do have a toaster, actually.

33:21.209 --> 33:22.579
You want me to go get it?
I'll get it.

33:22.612 --> 33:24.847
- I'm not going back in there!
- Ow! What?

33:24.881 --> 33:26.783
What is wrong with you?
Why did you just punch me?

33:26.816 --> 33:28.550
- That was pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

33:28.585 --> 33:30.252
- That's great, yeah.
- Yeah, uh-huh-huh, uh.

33:30.285 --> 33:31.654
Ow! Stop, I'm bruised!
I'm a little injured, okay.

33:31.688 --> 33:33.155
Hey,
you wanna learn how to fight?

33:33.188 --> 33:34.724
I sure
don't wanna learn how to fight.

33:34.757 --> 33:36.358
I know a place.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.828
No, are you're like a member of an underground
fight club or something like that?

33:38.861 --> 33:41.263
Oh. Come on.

33:41.296 --> 33:44.366
Wait, are you really a member
of an underground fight club?

33:47.637 --> 33:50.740
- Hey, Brookes!
- Hey, how you doin'?

33:50.773 --> 33:53.175
It's alright, go on.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.777
Check out this room.

34:00.349 --> 34:02.384
Oh, yeah.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.788
Whoo!

34:12.895 --> 34:15.297
Whoo!

34:29.444 --> 34:30.813
Whoo!

34:47.764 --> 34:52.200
Oh, my God.
That was pretty something.

34:53.402 --> 34:54.937
Whoo!

34:57.339 --> 34:58.273
Yeah.

35:08.383 --> 35:09.919
See? I told you this
place was really nice.

35:09.952 --> 35:11.988
Why are you
wearing that ridiculous hat?

35:12.021 --> 35:14.423
'Cause I don't
want anyone to see me.

35:14.456 --> 35:17.526
So look, I wait in the foyer
outside, you go inside,

35:17.559 --> 35:20.362
make sure the coast is clear, and then
come and get me when you're done, alright?

35:20.395 --> 35:21.430
Okay.

35:40.950 --> 35:43.318
Hello, Mr. Turner!

35:44.954 --> 35:48.958
Um, hi, Mr. Turner, hi.

35:48.991 --> 35:52.294
- Hi!
- I didn't expect to see you here.

35:52.327 --> 35:54.296
I heard about what happened.

35:54.329 --> 35:56.531
Just a little spat. Yeah, we're...
we're working things out.

35:56.565 --> 35:58.868
Well,
I just talked to Mr. Kinnebrew.

35:58.901 --> 36:01.303
And he said
that it didn't go well.

36:01.336 --> 36:03.740
Um, as a matter of fact, he
should be on his way here now.

36:03.773 --> 36:06.575
Mr. Kinnebrew is coming here?
Now? Great.

36:06.609 --> 36:09.444
That's good.
Good old da... dad's comin'.

36:09.478 --> 36:11.379
- I think I better call her.
- No, no, no, she's here.

36:11.413 --> 36:13.415
- She's here, she's here.
- Mrs. Kinnebrew is here?

36:13.448 --> 36:17.552
Yeah, she's just in the... the...
uh... uh, reception uh, hall.

36:17.587 --> 36:19.354
- Well, I'd... - She's there, but you...
- ...love to tell her hello.

36:19.387 --> 36:20.923
No, you don't have to,
it's fine, it's good.

36:20.957 --> 36:23.391
- No, really!
- It's good. You don't... it's fine.

36:23.425 --> 36:26.863
- Uh.
- Uh, listen, I... I appreciate what you're doing here, but...

36:26.896 --> 36:29.031
We're kinda workin' things out
together.

36:29.065 --> 36:30.800
And thank you so much.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.935
You're a lovely person,
love your outfit.

36:32.969 --> 36:34.871
- Okay.
- Love your location, bye-bye.

36:34.904 --> 36:36.739
- Uh, okay.
- Thank you so much.

36:44.479 --> 36:46.414
Is it as magical
as you thought it'd be?

36:46.448 --> 36:48.851
Yeah, it's beautiful.

36:48.885 --> 36:51.319
Yeah, it's somethin' else,
isn't it?

36:51.353 --> 36:52.588
Yeah.

36:59.128 --> 37:01.798
It's not always that perfect,
is it?

37:02.765 --> 37:04.499
No, it's not.

37:06.501 --> 37:10.072
Perfect is boring anyway,
you know?

37:11.707 --> 37:13.643
You know what isn't boring?

37:15.077 --> 37:16.813
Dancing.

37:18.413 --> 37:20.515
Stop staring.

37:20.549 --> 37:21.984
Let's dance, come on.

37:23.686 --> 37:25.554
- <i>♪ Dance with me ♪</i>
- Wish me luck.

37:25.588 --> 37:28.456
- <i>♪ Dance with me ♪</i>
- It's totally embarrassing.

37:28.490 --> 37:31.526
Okay, tell... tell...
oh, tell me.

37:31.560 --> 37:36.899
It was the theme song
from <i>Titanic.</i>

37:38.801 --> 37:40.837
- As I told you it was horrible.
- That was your choice, huh?

37:40.870 --> 37:43.739
Clearly, clearly.

37:51.848 --> 37:53.616
We need to go.

37:56.686 --> 38:00.790
Okay, but not before
I try a piece of your cake.

38:04.660 --> 38:07.063
Mmm, oh.

38:08.798 --> 38:10.666
I... I'm... I'm good,
thank you very much.

38:10.700 --> 38:13.836
- Okay.
- We can go. I... I...

38:13.870 --> 38:15.037
Oh.

38:16.105 --> 38:18.174
Isn't that good?

38:18.207 --> 38:20.810
That is delightful.

38:20.843 --> 38:23.045
- That is delicious.
- I know.

38:23.079 --> 38:25.648
We are takin' a couple pieces
for the road, okay?

38:25.681 --> 38:26.883
Okay.

38:26.916 --> 38:29.819
- Well, this one's for you.
- Thanks.

38:29.852 --> 38:31.087
I'm gonna take this all.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.722
Oh, can you hold mine?

38:32.755 --> 38:34.957
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go run to the loo, okay?

38:34.991 --> 38:36.926
Be right back.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.961
Okay, I'll be holdin' your cake.

38:46.501 --> 38:47.970
Good cake, huh?

38:50.840 --> 38:53.876
You know, I don't know
what you're doin' here

38:53.910 --> 38:56.178
and frankly, I don't care,

38:56.212 --> 38:58.446
but you're probably thinking you're
gonna see Miranda, try to get her back,

38:58.480 --> 38:59.815
that's not gonna happen.

39:00.983 --> 39:03.019
I told her,
right from the beginning,

39:03.052 --> 39:07.156
that you were no good, but you
know how bullheaded she is.

39:07.189 --> 39:09.025
Some people are meant to fly.

39:09.058 --> 39:11.193
My Miranda is meant to fly.

39:11.227 --> 39:15.530
And the sooner you learn that,
the sooner you go on with your life.

39:15.563 --> 39:20.502
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand by and
watch you pull her down with you in the gutter.

39:22.038 --> 39:23.973
Enjoy that cake, I paid for it.

39:30.545 --> 39:32.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:32.748 --> 39:34.050
Hi.

39:35.685 --> 39:38.654
My name is Yvette Chastain.

39:38.688 --> 39:41.123
- Okay.
- I am... I'm with Walton Estates.

39:41.157 --> 39:45.261
I'm so sorry that the restroom's
temporarily out of service for remodeling.

39:45.294 --> 39:46.929
Remodeling?

39:46.963 --> 39:49.265
We have this place rented
for a wedding tonight.

39:49.298 --> 39:54.536
Well, heh, they told me that it was canceled
and to go ahead with the work order.

39:54.569 --> 40:01.110
I'm so... I'm so sorry, but you know there is
a Porta Potty outside for your convenience.

40:01.143 --> 40:04.113
I've never used
a Porta Potty in my life!

40:04.146 --> 40:07.216
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Okay, thank you very much.

40:21.197 --> 40:22.598
What are we doin' here?

40:25.201 --> 40:27.303
You father-in-law's
a dick. Agreed.

40:27.336 --> 40:29.939
Well, what...
what are we doin' here?

40:29.972 --> 40:32.507
I have an idea, come with me.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.215
Hey, what the
hell are you doin'? Leave me alone!

40:39.248 --> 40:41.650
- - You're crazy!
- Come here. I need you.

40:41.684 --> 40:43.285
I'm not doing that.

40:47.590 --> 40:49.291
- What was that for?
- It's a diversion tactic.

40:49.325 --> 40:51.961
- Did it work?
- Okay.

40:54.130 --> 40:57.266
Okay, stop, stop!
What... what are you doin'?

40:57.299 --> 40:58.234

41:28.798 --> 41:31.233

- You used to write.

41:31.267 --> 41:36.105

47:54.349 --> 47:57.419
I think you should get
all your stuff, get together,

47:57.453 --> 48:01.089
we should go back to the hotel,
and just get our freak on.

48:01.123 --> 48:03.125

48:03.158 --> 48:06.028

- Do what? What? What?

48:13.168 --> 48:15.204

is that what you wanna do?

48:15.237 --> 48:17.239
I mean that is what
I'm paying you for, right?

48:17.272 --> 48:19.208
Let's just do it here,
I mean no one's around, right?

48:19.241 --> 48:21.644
This is a perfect spot.
I mean look at you, baby.

48:21.678 --> 48:24.379
You're so hot, so sexy.

48:24.413 --> 48:27.015
We could do a little
role play maybe, you know?

48:27.049 --> 48:30.519
Maybe you could call me uh,
Big Red.

48:30.552 --> 48:33.355
What could I call you, though?
What would that be?

48:33.388 --> 48:35.758
How about Jenny?

48:37.159 --> 48:40.562
It's... it is Jenny, right? There's a Jenny,
Jenny, Heather, I don't really remember.

48:40.597 --> 48:42.765
You're... you are such a jerk.

48:42.799 --> 48:45.501
I'm... I'm a jerk, that's right.
I'm the jerk, right?

48:45.534 --> 48:48.771
I'm the one takin' advantage of
someone on their wedding day,

48:48.805 --> 48:52.407
it's not your fault, though, it's not
Ronnie's fault, right? It's... it's my fault.

48:52.441 --> 48:55.444
Uh, continue to go ahead
and just steal all my money.

48:55.477 --> 48:58.146
No.
We didn't do any stealing.

48:58.180 --> 49:00.650
There was no stealing there.
Ronnie did this because he loves you,

49:00.683 --> 49:03.318
I needed money for school,
and he was going to pay you back.

49:03.352 --> 49:05.454
- Right, he's gonna pay me back!
- He was gonna pay you back!

49:05.487 --> 49:07.189
Pete the charity case,
"We're gonna pay you back."

49:07.222 --> 49:09.792
We got you covered, buddy.
That's okay.

49:09.826 --> 49:13.328
Uh, don't worry, though, 'cause
Pete won't do anything, right?

49:13.362 --> 49:16.131
He's too "sweet" a guy. He don't
have it in him, but...

49:16.164 --> 49:19.334
Are you seriously upset
that I'm not a hooker?

49:19.368 --> 49:22.437
At least with a hooker, I know that
I'm not gonna know her real name,

49:22.471 --> 49:26.776
we're not gonna be friends, and at the end
of the night, I'm never gonna see her again.

49:26.809 --> 49:30.345
Actually, you know what? You've
done a pretty damn good job.

49:33.115 --> 49:34.651
Enjoy the eclipse.

49:35.818 --> 49:37.319
Wait.

49:44.126 --> 49:45.427
Wait.

49:49.899 --> 49:55.304
- Hey, wait up!
- Freaking turd. Turd!

49:56.371 --> 49:58.273
Are you really about
to leave me right now?

49:58.307 --> 50:00.108
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

50:00.142 --> 50:01.878
Then why did you just answer me?

50:01.911 --> 50:05.113
- You got your money, you can go!
- I'm not gonna go.

50:05.147 --> 50:07.516
- You go.
- I'm... I'm going.

50:07.549 --> 50:09.752
- Uh, how can I go with you there?
- Go ahead. You can go.

50:09.786 --> 50:11.353
I'm going!

50:12.789 --> 50:17.459
- You stop the car now!
- I'm not stopping the car! Oh, what's wrong?

50:17.492 --> 50:22.665
Pete, can you just take this money? I
don't really feel safe around here. Just...

50:22.699 --> 50:25.434
Oh, you don't feel safe, so you give
me the money that way I'll get killed

50:25.467 --> 50:27.670
or mugged or whatever.
So sweet of you. That's great.

50:27.704 --> 50:30.873
Hey, also make sure when you don't
feel safe that you keep saying,

50:30.907 --> 50:34.443
"Here, take the money, take the money,
take the money!" That's awesome.

50:34.476 --> 50:36.511
So you're gonna take the money.
There you go.

50:36.545 --> 50:39.682
Thank you very much.
It's been a great night.

50:39.716 --> 50:41.483
Actually, you know what? No.

50:41.516 --> 50:43.686
Uh, why did you
come here tonight, huh?

50:43.720 --> 50:46.623
I know Ronnie sent you on some
kind of a little rescue mission

50:46.656 --> 50:48.691
or... or somethin' like that,

50:48.725 --> 50:50.727
but I'm tryin' to figure out
what kind of sick sadistic person

50:50.760 --> 50:52.561
preys on someone else's
emotions.

50:52.595 --> 50:54.196
You know, especially
someone they don't know.

50:54.229 --> 50:56.833
Just... just tryin' to
piece that together.

50:56.866 --> 50:59.334
I don't know, okay?

50:59.368 --> 51:00.637
I don't know
why I came here tonight.

51:00.670 --> 51:02.705
I... I thought
it would be harmless

51:02.739 --> 51:06.274
- and maybe just a little...
- "Just a little"... A little what?

51:06.976 --> 51:10.245
- It would be fun!
- Fun?

51:10.278 --> 51:12.782
Yeah, I'm having fun.
How about you?

51:12.815 --> 51:17.185
- Yeah, a blast.
- A blast, okay, great, yup.

51:17.219 --> 51:18.453
Oh.

51:21.724 --> 51:25.260
- Pete.
- Hey, so when you're not, uh, crushing men's souls

51:25.293 --> 51:28.798
or hooking, uh,
what do you do for a day job?

51:28.831 --> 51:30.967
I work at a bank.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.468
- What's that?
- I work at a bank.

51:33.502 --> 51:36.438
What?

51:36.471 --> 51:40.575
Oh, I... I'm just laughing, 'cause you...
you do take people's money for a living.

51:40.610 --> 51:42.745
Wow!

51:42.779 --> 51:45.380
As the night goes on, you just get
more and more charming. Don't you?

51:45.414 --> 51:47.449
- Oh, oh, thank you, bank teller.
- Stop it.

51:47.482 --> 51:49.551
- What's that, bank teller? Is it?
- It's Jen.

51:49.585 --> 51:52.855
Oh, Jen bank teller?
Or Heather bank teller?

51:52.889 --> 51:54.389
- I...
- Wait.

51:55.958 --> 51:58.628
- What's that noise?
- Uh, I don't hear anything.

52:00.395 --> 52:02.832
Okay, now, I do hear something.

52:04.332 --> 52:05.635
Ranchera music?

52:10.773 --> 52:11.974
- Hello.
- Hi.

52:12.008 --> 52:14.476
- Hey there.
- Sorry.

52:14.509 --> 52:19.514
Uh, my name is Pete.
Anyone speak English?

52:19.548 --> 52:21.918
English anyone?
Nothing? Okay.

52:21.951 --> 52:24.453
Uh, this is... is Jenny. Uh...

52:24.486 --> 52:26.488
She's a... a liar.

52:26.521 --> 52:28.658
Yeah, someone
who doesn't tell the truth.

52:28.691 --> 52:32.028
A fibber, a shyster.

52:32.061 --> 52:35.031
A shyster?
Am I in the mob now?

52:35.064 --> 52:39.301
You might as well be, 'cause
you lie just like a mobster.

52:39.334 --> 52:40.737
You don't even
make sense right now.

52:40.770 --> 52:42.772
What? You think they
don't lie in the mob?

52:42.805 --> 52:44.807
They lie in the mob every day.

52:44.841 --> 52:46.976
I've seen the <i>Godfather,</i>
it's in there.

52:47.009 --> 52:50.012
Uh, yeah, I've seen it, too.
It's not about lying.

52:50.046 --> 52:52.547
Well, it's not not about lying.

52:54.483 --> 53:00.288
So anyone
have any jumper cables?

53:00.322 --> 53:03.525
Jumper cables?
Jumper, jumper cables.

53:05.895 --> 53:10.499
Oh, Gabriela, traya Maria.

53:12.334 --> 53:15.504
Right, jumper cables.

53:21.510 --> 53:24.346
Does she have the jumper cables?

53:24.379 --> 53:25.948
Jumper cables.

53:28.483 --> 53:33.623
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Jump, no, no. Uh, no.

53:37.827 --> 53:39.461
Oh, she wants to dance with you.

53:39.494 --> 53:41.363
No, no bailar.

53:41.396 --> 53:44.566
Go. It's... it's the birthday
girl, don't let her down, Pete.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.602
- No, oh... Oh, okay!
- Ow!

53:46.636 --> 53:49.371
Alright. Hey, hey, alright.

53:49.404 --> 53:52.942
Yeah, okay, yeah! It's good.

53:52.975 --> 53:54.777
Alright.

53:59.582 --> 54:02.785
So the door flies open, the cook
runs out of the kitchen,

54:02.819 --> 54:05.554
and says, "Uh, I think
we're having nachos."

54:10.425 --> 54:12.427
Maria!

54:14.931 --> 54:17.033
She's mine!

54:17.066 --> 54:20.603
- Are you her lover?
- No! No! No, no, no, no, no!

54:20.636 --> 54:22.537
No lover. You can have her.

54:22.571 --> 54:25.041
- We fight now.
- Oh, my tattoo.

54:25.074 --> 54:27.109
- I'm a lover, not a fight... Not her lover...
- Fight!

54:27.143 --> 54:29.745
Okay, I... Mm...

54:29.779 --> 54:32.380
Oh, crap.

54:32.414 --> 54:34.516
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

54:48.064 --> 54:50.333
Oh, oh, oh.

55:00.943 --> 55:02.879
Okay, what are you doing?

55:02.912 --> 55:04.947
I'm openin' the car!

55:07.717 --> 55:10.753
- Open me!
- Now, you... we... we gotta pull the handle on the same time!

55:10.786 --> 55:14.156
Ready? One, two, three.
Together!

55:14.190 --> 55:16.092
One, two, three.

55:22.231 --> 55:25.735
- Mother lover!
- God, um, do you want me to try?

55:25.768 --> 55:26.802
- If you think it'll start this...
- Okay.

55:26.836 --> 55:28.104
...please, come.

55:28.137 --> 55:31.173
Ow!

55:31.207 --> 55:33.109
Crap it.

55:33.142 --> 55:36.779
- Hello, door, door! - Okay, 1, 2...
- One, two, three.

55:36.812 --> 55:38.114
One, two.

55:46.122 --> 55:47.757
Hello?

55:53.629 --> 55:55.131
Hello?

56:00.770 --> 56:03.139
Hello? Uh...

56:07.910 --> 56:10.046
- Should go.
- Uh, uh, okay. - Okay.

56:10.079 --> 56:13.816
- Phew. It should go.
- Said nothing.

56:26.011 --> 56:27.596
You are letting them get away!

56:27.638 --> 56:30.807
I don't care, my life has ended.

56:32.809 --> 56:34.978
If you were my friend you would
kill me right now.

56:39.399 --> 56:40.776
What are you doing, you idiot?

56:40.817 --> 56:41.985
You told me to kill you!

56:42.027 --> 56:44.446
If I'm gonna die, I'll die like a man!

56:45.822 --> 56:49.034
1, 2, 3, then you run over me.

56:56.834 --> 56:58.794
What's wrong with you?

56:58.836 --> 57:00.587
1, 2, 3, and run over me.

57:00.629 --> 57:03.215
On 3 or after 3?

57:03.632 --> 57:07.427
1, 2, 3, and run over me.

57:08.053 --> 57:09.721
This is the last time, understand?

57:17.213 --> 57:18.681
Hello?

57:20.440 --> 57:25.821
No, my love, forgive me.
I'm on my way!

57:25.863 --> 57:28.782
I promise. Forgive me, forgive me!

57:35.080 --> 57:36.832
She loves me!

57:36.874 --> 57:38.041
Of course she loves you!

57:38.083 --> 57:41.086
She wants to go back to the house!

57:44.306 --> 57:45.241
Whoo!

57:47.009 --> 57:49.178
- I don't see him anymore.
- Yeah.

57:49.211 --> 57:51.247
I think we're good.

57:52.915 --> 57:55.885
- Nice driving, by the way.
- Thank you. Well, it's pretty good.

57:55.918 --> 57:59.588
Hey, I... I guess I have to say,
uh, thank you

57:59.622 --> 58:02.758
for potentially saving my life
by punching that guy also.

58:02.792 --> 58:05.327
Come on, potentially?
Come on.

58:05.361 --> 58:07.797
I definitely saved your life.

58:07.830 --> 58:12.301
Okay, so I owe you or am I supposed to
be like your indentured servant or...

58:12.334 --> 58:15.671
It's exactly what I need in my
life, an indentured servant.

58:15.704 --> 58:17.606
Cool.

58:17.640 --> 58:20.242
But I will let it slide

58:20.276 --> 58:25.648
if you can, um, forgive me
for lying to you.

58:26.415 --> 58:30.286
I forgive you.

58:30.319 --> 58:32.822
By the way,
it's nice to meet the real you.

58:35.091 --> 58:36.992
Jenny, right?

58:37.026 --> 58:38.961
- Hmm.
- Right.

58:40.996 --> 58:43.966
Yeah, turn right here.

58:43.999 --> 58:48.838
I bet you never thought your day would end up
like this when you woke up, huh?

58:48.871 --> 58:51.707
I guess not. I... I mean probably
right about now Miranda and I...

58:51.740 --> 58:54.777
Hey, okay,
enough with the Miranda.

58:54.810 --> 58:58.814
It's time to get her out of your
life once and for all, you know?

59:00.015 --> 59:03.819
- What do you mean?
- I... I think we should just get rid of everything in your life

59:03.853 --> 59:06.021
that has to do with Miranda.

59:06.055 --> 59:10.926
Um, I don't think we have anything
that has anything to do with Miranda.

59:10.960 --> 59:13.395
I could think of a few things.

59:17.766 --> 59:20.202
Overhand or underhand,
you got to make a decision.

59:20.236 --> 59:22.705
- I'm gonna do over.
- Overhand, okay.

59:22.738 --> 59:25.374
Okay, make sure you
lift... lift your leg up high.

59:25.407 --> 59:29.078
High, oh... Uh-huh!
I see what you did there.

59:29.111 --> 59:32.815
No, it's for distance. I just want to make
sure it's gonna clear the plate, alright?

59:32.848 --> 59:35.951
- You know, baseball card.
- Nice.

59:35.985 --> 59:38.787
Is it good? No?
Alright, whatever.

59:38.821 --> 59:41.690
I like this pattern.

59:41.724 --> 59:43.726
I can tell you
you're in trouble, girl.

59:45.394 --> 59:48.931
- Ready?
- One, two, three.

59:50.032 --> 59:53.235
- Whoo! Ow!
- That just happened, people.

59:53.269 --> 59:55.004
- That just happened...
- How did it feel?

59:55.037 --> 59:56.939
- Are you ready? - Up top.
- Alright, here we go.

59:56.972 --> 1:00:00.309
- It's my turn.
- Okay, you pick your poison.

1:00:00.342 --> 1:00:04.246
- I want that one.
- Okay, sure.

1:00:05.748 --> 1:00:10.252
This is for you. I'm coming at
you, okay? Three, two...

Why would a bank teller pretend

1:00:44.353 --> 1:00:48.257
- a hooker, a hoebag...
- Okay, oh, oh, no.

1:00:48.290 --> 1:00:50.259
- No, hoebag's too far?
- Yeah. - Is that the line?

1:00:50.292 --> 1:00:51.293
Okay, I'm sorry.

1:00:52.394 --> 1:00:56.131
Ronnie... Ronnie just told me
what happened to you

1:00:56.165 --> 1:00:57.967
and it's a soft spot,
I guess I kinda...

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.903
Um, don't say
you feel sorry for me.

1:01:01.971 --> 1:01:05.341
I don't feel sorry for me.

1:01:05.374 --> 1:01:09.378
I mean it sucked, right, but

1:01:10.813 --> 1:01:16.151
I don't know I got to meet you.
That has been pretty awesome.

1:01:19.355 --> 1:01:22.558
Look, I want you
to keep the money.

1:01:22.592 --> 1:01:24.226
No, I'm not gonna keep
your money.

1:01:24.260 --> 1:01:27.162
Yes, just...
just keep the money.

1:01:27.196 --> 1:01:32.234
Look, I would pay it all over again if
I could spend another night with you.

1:01:36.472 --> 1:01:40.342
What was that?
Like, oh my gosh!

1:01:40.376 --> 1:01:42.945
It's just so sappy,
and horrible,

1:01:42.978 --> 1:01:46.782
and will you just punch me
in the face right now, please?

1:01:50.052 --> 1:01:53.222
How about that moon, huh?
Look at that moon.

1:01:53.255 --> 1:01:55.291
Let's get this show
on the road.

1:01:55.324 --> 1:02:00.095
- Oh, okay, we're layin', okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

1:02:00.129 --> 1:02:02.131
Oh, what...

1:02:02.164 --> 1:02:04.300
I think your
hair is in my mouth right now.

1:02:04.333 --> 1:02:06.201
Oh, sorry.

1:02:06.235 --> 1:02:08.470
You know, we've met before,
right?

1:02:09.938 --> 1:02:13.008
- What? - Mm-hmm.
- Uh...

1:02:13.042 --> 1:02:16.578
You and Ronnie came to the bank
drive-through window.

1:02:16.613 --> 1:02:19.248
You filled up the deposit
container with soda

1:02:19.281 --> 1:02:22.151
and then you sent it back up the
tube to me, do you remember that?

1:02:22.184 --> 1:02:26.855
Yeah.
Yeah, that was you, huh?

1:02:26.889 --> 1:02:29.291
Oh, so sorry.

1:02:29.325 --> 1:02:32.328
Yeah, that was me. And you guys
just drove off laughing.

1:02:32.361 --> 1:02:35.164
I was like, "Who's this jerk
that thinks he's so funny?"

1:02:35.197 --> 1:02:39.034
Oh, uh, the reason I thought
that is because I was so funny.

1:02:39.068 --> 1:02:42.371
- No.
- That's funny, that's comedy gold, you have to admit.

1:02:42.404 --> 1:02:45.140
It's not funny.

1:02:48.544 --> 1:02:51.146
Nice.

1:02:51.180 --> 1:02:54.149
It'll happen any second now.

1:03:27.282 --> 1:03:30.319
Oh, I cannot believe
we missed the eclipse.

1:03:30.352 --> 1:03:32.622
I know.

1:03:32.655 --> 1:03:37.159
Uh, I mean this thing comes what,
once every 50 years and then we miss it.

1:03:37.192 --> 1:03:38.927
Really, 50?

1:03:38.961 --> 1:03:42.297
No, actually, I have no idea.
I totally made that up.

1:03:42.331 --> 1:03:45.968
Uh, I'm gonna get somethin' to drink. You want somethin'?

1:03:46.001 --> 1:03:49.505
- Yeah, get me one of those, um...
- Wait, hang on, let... let me take a guess.

1:03:49.538 --> 1:03:56.512
You're probably like what, one of those,
uh, passion fruit tea girls, is that right?

1:03:56.545 --> 1:04:00.449
You spend one night with a girl and
you think you know what she wants, huh?

1:04:00.482 --> 1:04:02.451
Um, I pretty
much got you pegged.

1:04:02.484 --> 1:04:04.153
- You think so?
- Yeah, I do.

1:04:04.186 --> 1:04:06.221
Actually, I think I pretty much
got you pegged.

1:04:06.255 --> 1:04:10.159
Okay, well,
let's see who knows who best.

1:04:10.192 --> 1:04:13.028
That's a challenge
that you're gonna lose.

1:04:13.061 --> 1:04:16.165
- Okay, we each get $5.
- Okay. - Five.

1:04:16.198 --> 1:04:18.400
- Mm-hmm.
- Just 5. - Mm-hmm.

1:04:18.434 --> 1:04:20.536
I buy you something, you buy me
something, and we'll see what happens.

1:04:20.569 --> 1:04:24.440
Alright, so this place probably has
like, you know, canned caviar

1:04:24.473 --> 1:04:28.076
and Boone's Farm is that... is that...
That's more your taste, right?

1:04:28.110 --> 1:04:31.046
- You're not funny.
- I actually am funny.

1:04:31.079 --> 1:04:33.348
- You're not funny.
- Hmm, I'm funny. - Yeah.

1:04:36.719 --> 1:04:40.657
- Boom.
- Boom, but can you top this?

1:04:40.690 --> 1:04:42.424
Huh?

1:04:42.458 --> 1:04:46.295
The awesome insert here.
Looks like another little cat.

1:04:46.328 --> 1:04:48.063
Hey, little fella.

1:04:49.031 --> 1:04:54.570
Okay, feminine product. Whoa!
More feminine products, yes.

1:04:54.604 --> 1:04:57.206
- Here, you need this.
- Maybe.

1:04:57.239 --> 1:04:59.441
- Hmm.
- Thanks. - Yeah.

1:04:59.475 --> 1:05:02.144
Oh.
What is that over there?

1:05:02.177 --> 1:05:04.546
- What? What? - Just...
- I'm sorry.

1:05:04.581 --> 1:05:07.416
- Stop it.
- What?

1:05:07.449 --> 1:05:11.119
Right, now, you...
you're tryin' to peek, so stop.

1:05:11.153 --> 1:05:14.156
No, somebody was watching me like a hawk.

1:05:14.189 --> 1:05:16.391
- Okay.
- Okay, um, you first.

1:05:19.194 --> 1:05:20.663
Here we go.

1:05:22.531 --> 1:05:25.334
Bam! Kung Fu DVD!

1:05:26.669 --> 1:05:29.204
- Cool.
- Oh, come on!

1:05:29.238 --> 1:05:32.709
Seriously?
The wrestling match, the fiesta.

1:05:33.810 --> 1:05:36.378
- I know.
- True, true.

1:05:36.411 --> 1:05:38.547
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1:05:38.581 --> 1:05:40.148
Okay, give me mine.

1:05:40.182 --> 1:05:42.050
I don't know
why I'm giving this to you.

1:05:42.084 --> 1:05:43.318
Are you having second thoughts?

1:05:43.352 --> 1:05:45.387
I am totally
having second thoughts.

1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:47.724
Mm-hmm.

1:05:47.757 --> 1:05:49.057
Who's this pretty lady?

1:05:50.593 --> 1:05:55.330
- The reason I got that for you is...
- Is I am hot in a bathing suit.

1:05:55.364 --> 1:05:57.667
Um, I can only imagine.

1:05:57.700 --> 1:06:01.370
That is probably a true statement.

1:06:01.403 --> 1:06:06.174
But apparently,
I would rather see you dance

1:06:06.208 --> 1:06:07.777
than get laid by you.

1:06:08.678 --> 1:06:13.115
- Did you just make that up?
- Uh, only if it worked.

1:06:14.216 --> 1:06:16.418
Okay. Um...

1:06:18.788 --> 1:06:22.725
Wow. I guess it worked.

1:06:22.759 --> 1:06:24.326
Awesome.

1:06:26.528 --> 1:06:29.832
There you go.

1:08:22.645 --> 1:08:24.981
- Hello? - <i>Oh, hey, Mr. Turner.</i>
- Hey.

1:08:25.014 --> 1:08:27.750
<i>There's a young lady here
who said she's with you.</i>

1:08:27.784 --> 1:08:29.819
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, I'll send her up.</i>

1:08:29.852 --> 1:08:31.754
- Thank you.
- <i>Oh, one more thing, you wanted to ask...</i>

1:08:33.288 --> 1:08:37.994
Shoes. Shoes, shoes.

1:08:38.027 --> 1:08:40.495
Knot. Let's do a knot.

1:08:42.832 --> 1:08:44.332
Hang on.

1:08:47.036 --> 1:08:48.604
Hang on.

1:08:55.011 --> 1:08:56.244
Pete.

1:09:00.382 --> 1:09:02.652
Pete.

1:09:04.587 --> 1:09:07.355
I know that I'm the last person
that you wanna see right now.

1:09:08.624 --> 1:09:10.893
I just had to do
some thinking and I did.

1:09:10.927 --> 1:09:14.362
I... I needed to clear my head,
I was so confused.

1:09:15.598 --> 1:09:16.699
Can I help you?

1:09:24.674 --> 1:09:26.709
Your breakfast, Mr. Turner.

1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:33.381
What on earth
do they let these people wear?

1:09:33.415 --> 1:09:35.585
She looks like
she's straight from the gutter.

1:09:39.055 --> 1:09:40.823
You can go now.

1:09:44.994 --> 1:09:49.599
Oh, honey, take care of her.
Give her a tip.

1:10:00.009 --> 1:10:04.046
You can't give that to her.
What are you doing?

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:07.917
Sorry, sometimes my husband
is a little generous.

1:10:07.950 --> 1:10:09.652
That should do.

1:10:10.887 --> 1:10:12.521
I'm okay.

1:10:22.865 --> 1:10:27.670
Wow, you really did miss me last
night, didn't you?

1:10:28.570 --> 1:10:31.774
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you had company.

1:10:37.512 --> 1:10:39.682
You won't be
needing her anymore.

1:10:40.983 --> 1:10:45.021
I talked to dad and... and
he said no worries at work.

1:10:45.054 --> 1:10:48.658
He'll take care of everything and you can
go back to work in just a couple of weeks.

1:10:48.691 --> 1:10:52.762
I was thinking maybe we could
have a wedding on the beach.

1:10:52.795 --> 1:10:56.966
Maybe we could even do it at a resort and
then just enjoy a couple of weeks of quiet,

1:10:56.999 --> 1:10:59.769
and beach, and relaxing.

1:10:59.802 --> 1:11:01.938
It'll be so nice,

1:11:01.971 --> 1:11:07.076
And then when we come home, we can
start our life together, for real here.

1:11:08.778 --> 1:11:12.414
It'd be so nice. Pete?

1:11:46.949 --> 1:11:53.488
And then when we come home, we can
start our life together, for real here.

1:11:55.057 --> 1:11:57.093
Pete?

1:12:32.662 --> 1:12:34.997
Hey, whoa!

1:12:35.031 --> 1:12:36.732
About time, Petey!

1:12:36.766 --> 1:12:38.601
I've been here for
about 10 minutes, man!

1:12:38.634 --> 1:12:40.169
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
- I'm good, I like that jacket.

1:12:40.202 --> 1:12:42.171
- Good to see you.
- Oh! Relax, man! - Oh God.

1:12:42.204 --> 1:12:44.572
Oh yeah, that hurt worse than
I thought it was gonna hurt.

1:12:44.607 --> 1:12:45.808
Oh, that was bad.

1:12:47.243 --> 1:12:49.745
- I deserved that.
- Yeah, you did.

1:12:49.779 --> 1:12:53.182
Oh, it hurts bad,
but I deserve it.

1:12:53.215 --> 1:12:56.218
I really gotta learn how to punch more.

1:12:58.553 --> 1:13:00.856
- You need to punch from the hip.
- Yeah, shut up.

1:13:00.890 --> 1:13:02.490
Okay.

1:13:03.525 --> 1:13:06.128
I'm sorry, man.

1:13:06.162 --> 1:13:09.865
Phew!

1:13:09.899 --> 1:13:12.234
- Are you cryin'?
- No.

1:13:14.536 --> 1:13:17.106
- Are you sure? You ain't... ain't...
- No, I'm not cryin', man.

1:13:17.139 --> 1:13:22.244
Listen, I just didn't want you
to be alone is all.

1:13:22.278 --> 1:13:24.180
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1:13:25.147 --> 1:13:29.785
Yeah, well, you know what?

1:13:29.819 --> 1:13:31.821
Don't be.

1:13:31.854 --> 1:13:33.823
She's like amazing.

1:13:34.957 --> 1:13:36.726
Why didn't you tell me
you have a cousin like that?

1:13:36.759 --> 1:13:39.595
I don't.
She's not my real cousin.

1:13:39.628 --> 1:13:42.898
You know our families just kinda grew
up together. I call her my cousin.

1:13:42.932 --> 1:13:44.600
Pete, I love her.

1:13:45.835 --> 1:13:48.671
I'm just kidding. Ouch.

1:13:48.704 --> 1:13:52.141
- Oh.
- Oh, you are like the bastard of the year.

1:13:52.174 --> 1:13:54.010
I hope your jaw's like
broken in like three places.

1:13:54.043 --> 1:13:55.911
It's still there, though, right?

1:13:55.945 --> 1:13:57.913
Yeah, it's still there I'm afraid.
Do you know where she's at?

1:14:00.149 --> 1:14:02.651
Yeah. Ouch.

1:14:02.685 --> 1:14:05.588
- Every time I laugh at you...
- Yeah.

1:14:05.621 --> 1:14:07.189
Man, you're gonna run me over
the parking like... like that.

1:14:07.223 --> 1:14:09.725
You're... you're...
you're not coming with me!

1:14:09.759 --> 1:14:11.193
You're not coming with me!

1:14:11.227 --> 1:14:13.662
- Well, uh, you don't...
- Go back!

1:14:13.696 --> 1:14:14.864
Go back to your curb!

1:14:14.897 --> 1:14:16.564
How're you gonna get there?

1:14:16.599 --> 1:14:18.300
- You don't...
- In the car!

1:14:18.334 --> 1:14:20.636
- You don't know where you're going yet?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

1:14:20.669 --> 1:14:24.140
Get in the car,
but I'm droppin' you off!

1:14:32.681 --> 1:14:35.117
I'm sorry.

1:14:35.151 --> 1:14:39.055
How are you, Mr. Miller?
Good.

1:14:39.088 --> 1:14:40.656
Deposit?

1:14:44.226 --> 1:14:46.095
You have a good one.

1:14:57.339 --> 1:14:59.842
So technically,
I was kinda thinking

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:05.081
that maybe this honeymoon thing is still happening and that...

1:15:05.114 --> 1:15:08.017
Hey, hang on a second,
bud, okay?

1:15:08.050 --> 1:15:10.352
The thing is it's...

1:15:10.386 --> 1:15:12.822
it's not really fun when you're doin' it by yourself you know...

1:15:12.855 --> 1:15:15.624
Hey, hang on a second, okay?

1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:19.695
And I... I was just thinking that...

1:15:19.728 --> 1:15:23.666
Dammit. Hey, I'm talkin'!
I'm trying to have a moment, dude!

1:15:23.699 --> 1:15:27.002
Can't you see this? I'm here with this
lady. We're tryin' to do something!

1:15:27.036 --> 1:15:33.109
Shut your pie hole or your horn hole
or whatever noise you just made!

1:15:33.142 --> 1:15:36.112
I will destroy you
with these hands!

1:15:36.145 --> 1:15:37.980
I'll destroy you, sir!

1:15:38.013 --> 1:15:42.084
I'm talking to the lady!
Please, shut up!

1:15:44.753 --> 1:15:47.123
I like you.

1:15:47.156 --> 1:15:54.330
I like you and I don't care if we're gettin'
coffee or dancing or crashing some random party.

1:15:54.363 --> 1:15:56.198
I... I just wanna be with you

1:15:56.232 --> 1:16:02.838
and I was kinda hopin' that
maybe if you felt the same way,

1:16:02.872 --> 1:16:08.144
we could keep this honeymoon
thing rolling a little bit longer.

1:16:25.728 --> 1:16:27.196
Of course.

1:16:45.347 --> 1:16:49.051
Whoo! Whoo!

1:16:49.084 --> 1:16:51.754
Yeah, buddy,
what do you think of that, son?

1:16:51.787 --> 1:16:54.890
You better get out of here, Casanova.
Get off my ass!

1:16:54.924 --> 1:16:58.894
Whoa.
I'm gonna call you, okay?

1:16:58.928 --> 1:17:00.896
