Five years ago, Eiling and Wells
were working on a project...

16:33.840 --> 16:36.491
...to expand soldiers' cognitive abilities
during battle.

16:36.680 --> 16:40.571
We didn't realize that Eiling was trying
to create soldiers with psychic abilities.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.330

16:42.520 --> 16:47.242
Eiling was trying to create these super-soldiers
with telepathic and telekinetic capabilities.

When Wells found out about
the terrible experiments Eiling was doing...

16:50.920 --> 16:52.445

I went down to check on him...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.205

Eiling injected him with could've activated.
