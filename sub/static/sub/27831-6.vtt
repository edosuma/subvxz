WEBVTT

00:17.142 --> 00:18.018
Did you find her?

00:19.853 --> 00:20.687
Where'd she go?

00:20.854 --> 00:21.771
She's in danger.

00:22.105 --> 00:22.939
-Huh?
-What?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.024
Actually...

00:24.524 --> 00:25.400
Originally,

00:25.859 --> 00:27.861
I intended to die.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.196
As of yesterday,

00:30.739 --> 00:32.824
Ayumi Kohinata has gone missing.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.536
We won't let her kill herself.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.663
Track her down at whatever cost!

00:39.080 --> 00:39.914
-Got it.
-Yeah.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.682
What's wrong?

00:58.349 --> 01:00.268
Wanna grab something hot to drink?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.396
Come on, just for a little bit.

01:03.646 --> 01:04.647
How 'bout it?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.442
What's with you, ugly?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.741
<i>I changed my appearance</i>
<i>but I'm still the same inside.</i>

01:19.954 --> 01:21.706
<i>What's inside?</i>

01:24.292 --> 01:25.210
<i>What...</i>

01:27.212 --> 01:28.046
<i>am I?</i>

02:29.899 --> 02:36.114
SHUFFLE

02:41.578 --> 02:43.621
This was very well thought out.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.083
Surely if this method is carried out, you would all go back to normal.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.381
Yeah...

02:55.884 --> 02:58.761
Do you... intend on going back?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.142
Of course not.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.896
I finally got this body after all.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.236
I was like you before.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.032
What?

03:22.076 --> 03:24.662
I was raised in a poor family.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.915
I was always alone.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.045
If I had money,
then my whole life would change.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.922
With that in mind,

03:34.505 --> 03:37.133
I switched with the daughter
of a wealthy family.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.302
I...

03:40.428 --> 03:41.596
envy you.

03:42.138 --> 03:42.972
Huh?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.974
Because you're free, right?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.353
My entire life,

03:48.853 --> 03:51.272
everything has been decided
for me by my parents.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.782
Hey,

04:02.742 --> 04:04.077
would you switch with me?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.413
After that,

04:07.914 --> 04:10.041
I had friends and a boyfriend.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.921
I wanted to keep this life forever,
even die for it.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.262
Then why?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.851
Why did you try to go back?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.145
That's something...

04:32.355 --> 04:34.315
you already know without asking.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.773
No!

05:21.029 --> 05:21.946
Since then,

05:23.239 --> 05:25.575
I've always been alone.

05:30.997 --> 05:31.998
You...

05:33.207 --> 05:35.585
might end up like me
if you stay that way.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.643
<i>Even though I stole Ayumi Kohinata's body,</i>

05:53.102 --> 05:56.105
I couldn't become Ayumi Kohinata.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.026
What's with you, ugly?

06:02.528 --> 06:03.363
<i>You...</i>

06:03.821 --> 06:05.865
might end up like me
if you stay that way.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.089
-Kohinata!
-Ayumi!

06:27.053 --> 06:28.304
Ayumi!

06:31.224 --> 06:33.476
<i>The Ayumi everyone is looking for...</i>

06:34.644 --> 06:36.104
<i>is not me.</i>

06:40.900 --> 06:42.443
Umine!

06:43.236 --> 06:44.570
Umine!

06:58.543 --> 07:00.169
Thank you for searching so late.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.172
<i>Mom...</i>

07:03.673 --> 07:04.882
<i>she's wasting away.</i>

07:06.551 --> 07:07.927
<i>She hasn't slept.</i>

07:11.097 --> 07:14.559
I've been to every place
where she might have gone.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.727
Places she might've gone?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.897
Like the park she went to as a child

07:20.857 --> 07:22.358
and other memorable places.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.116
I might know of a place.
I'll check there, too!

07:30.241 --> 07:31.617
Take a short break, Mom!

07:32.160 --> 07:32.994
Huh?

07:34.120 --> 07:37.206
<i>We don't know anything about Umine.</i>

07:37.373 --> 07:40.376
<i>So there's only one person to ask.</i>

07:45.548 --> 07:46.549
Mom!

07:48.509 --> 07:49.719
We'll talk later.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.061
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.355
I...

08:03.107 --> 08:04.609
am not Zenko.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.072
I'm really her classmate, Ayumi Kohinata.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.784
What're you talking about?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.495
I know it sounds unbelievable.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.246
But please listen.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.373
Right now,

08:19.707 --> 08:22.960
Umine is in my body and she is missing.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.547
If we don't find her soon, she might die.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.888
Is there anywhere you can think of
where she might go?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.224
-I don't know.
-Memorable places?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.351
-Or with her dad?
-I said I don't know!

08:47.777 --> 08:49.946
I'm sorry for saying these weird things.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.038
Akatsuki Forest.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.881
Thank you very much!

09:17.139 --> 09:20.434
MAP OF AKATSUKI FOREST

09:21.435 --> 09:23.437
We'll have to split up and search.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.941
Kaga and I will look.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.444
Ayumi, you go back home.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.905
I can't do that. I'm going too.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.490
But the forest is pitch black.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.202
Ayumi, you're afraid of the dark.
It's too dangerous.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.041
Please... let me go, too.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.044
I promise I won't be a burden to you two.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.427
Ayumi can take the path on the right.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.344
Kaga!

09:55.970 --> 09:57.430
She's determined to go anyway.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.771
Don't overexert yourself.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.648
I won't. Let's get going.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.666
Umine... where are you?

10:41.807 --> 10:42.642
<i>I'm scared.</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:44.477
<i>But...</i>

10:44.977 --> 10:45.978
<i>why am I scared?</i>

10:47.229 --> 10:48.522
<i>I understand now.</i>

10:49.857 --> 10:51.359
<i>Back then,</i>

10:51.525 --> 10:55.196
<i>when I was inside a darkness</i>
<i>I thought would last forever,</i>

10:55.738 --> 10:58.658
<i>I felt a fear so deep</i>
<i>that I couldn't bear it.</i>

11:06.290 --> 11:07.541
<i>Umine, too...</i>

11:08.417 --> 11:13.214
<i>might have been suffering</i>
<i>in that darkness this whole time.</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:45.222
Umine?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.644
Are you okay?

13:03.407 --> 13:06.160
-Umine?
-Don't come near me with that face!

13:06.368 --> 13:07.536
I'm begging you.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.794
Everyone is worried about you.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.547
Let's go home together.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.386
No...

13:28.682 --> 13:31.185
You just came to get your body back.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.690
It wasn't just Kaga.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.820
Even Koshiro took your side
and you all just think I'm pathetic.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.613
That's not true!

13:43.614 --> 13:44.615
I...

13:45.908 --> 13:50.371
am truly glad...
that you're alive and safe.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.167
Go away.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.963
Go away!

14:05.845 --> 14:06.929
Ayumi!

14:07.012 --> 14:07.847
Are you okay?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.099
I am, but...

14:12.393 --> 14:13.269
Umine.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.356
I came to get you.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.326
You didn't come for me, Koshiro.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.330
You came for this body, right?

14:34.832 --> 14:35.708
Yes.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.169
Don't think that I feel something for you.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.214
Whether you return to normal

14:43.799 --> 14:45.259
or stay looking like that,

14:48.178 --> 14:50.598
I will never have
romantic feelings for you.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.017
Never.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.274
-Hey, aren't you being harsh--
-But I can sympathize.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.612
Thinking about how you've lived,
I can feel compassion for you.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.907
But if you say

15:08.365 --> 15:10.409
you're not giving Ayumi her body back,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.789
I would only feel resentment.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.921
I'd deeply despise you.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.764
Hey,

15:32.181 --> 15:35.351
was every person truly
as bad as you thought?

15:38.979 --> 15:41.649
I don't remember an attitude change
before the switch.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.903
Both Ayumi and Koshiro reached out to you.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.529
I'll help you.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.531
I can do it alone.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.784
Umine, are you okay?

15:52.451 --> 15:53.410
You can use my notes.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.912
I don't need it.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.958
You rejected others

15:59.333 --> 16:01.377
but wanted to be loved
when it was convenient.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.004
-Isn't that too selfish?
-Enough already!

16:08.676 --> 16:10.970
I get what you're both saying, but I can't blame Umine.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.603
No one...

16:22.982 --> 16:25.192
understood me, either.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.652
I'm Ayumi!

16:26.777 --> 16:28.070
Are you Ayumi's friend?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.238
Don't come near Ayumi.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.031
I'm sorry if I led you on.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.992
<i>That wasn't all.</i>

16:33.158 --> 16:34.910
Go take a look in the mirror!

16:34.994 --> 16:36.578
Kaga's into ugly girls!

16:36.662 --> 16:38.080
We aren't friends.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.374
Is she even aware that she's ugly?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.251
<i>It hurt so suddenly.</i>

16:43.377 --> 16:45.754
<i>I was helplessly in pain.</i>

16:47.589 --> 16:48.757
Certainly...

16:52.469 --> 16:54.513
Umine felt the same thing before.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.767
Being like that,

17:00.227 --> 17:02.271
there's nothing you can do alone!

17:03.522 --> 17:05.607
You can't be strong

17:05.691 --> 17:08.152
and you can't make a right judgment.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.555
Can you...

17:38.974 --> 17:42.061
stop talking to me like I'm in the wrong?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.360
You're all so good-looking, aren't you?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.529
You're just saying pretty things

17:52.738 --> 17:55.032
to justify it, right?

18:01.580 --> 18:02.790
But,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.042
if you were born with this face,

18:05.209 --> 18:06.627
could you say the same things?

18:08.962 --> 18:11.590
You like Ayumi no matter how she looks?

18:12.716 --> 18:16.595
Don't make me laugh. You only say that
because she was cute before!

18:20.182 --> 18:22.559
Don't act tough.
Say what you're really thinking.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.939
That you're so ugly now
and you want your pretty body back!

18:27.022 --> 18:27.940
That's enough!

18:30.067 --> 18:32.444
If we're just saying pretty things,

18:32.820 --> 18:34.488
then you have a persecution complex!

18:34.571 --> 18:35.656
What!

18:36.115 --> 18:37.908
Do you know what it's like?

18:37.991 --> 18:40.077
Have you been called ugly
by people passing by?

18:40.160 --> 18:42.746
Or been called vermin
for bumping into someone?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.627
I wanted to disappear.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.005
There was nowhere for me to go.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.299
I had no friends.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.553
I...

19:04.560 --> 19:06.228
Zenko!

19:09.815 --> 19:11.108
Mom?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.241
What the hell are you doing?!

19:22.661 --> 19:24.913
How... did you know?

19:27.499 --> 19:28.584
At first,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.794
I didn't believe it, but...

19:32.004 --> 19:33.422
I was sure with one look.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.680
I'm deeply sorry...

19:42.973 --> 19:45.809
for all the trouble... Zenko has caused.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.481
You apologize with me!

19:52.065 --> 19:53.066
Do it quickly.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.776
Shut up!

19:54.860 --> 19:57.321
Don't act like you're my mom now!

20:13.503 --> 20:14.963
What?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.383
What the hell is so funny?

20:19.343 --> 20:22.221
You have such a cute face now.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.850
But your personality...

20:28.268 --> 20:29.478
didn't change, did it?

20:32.022 --> 20:33.482
You poor child.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.919
I...

20:56.838 --> 20:59.299
threw you away with my body.

21:01.969 --> 21:02.844
Well...

21:04.763 --> 21:07.641
I never thought of you as family
in the first place.

21:19.653 --> 21:20.821
Umine!

21:34.042 --> 21:36.003
-Umine!
-Stay back!

21:40.716 --> 21:41.758
It's dangerous there.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.595
Let's go home.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.140
Enough with the lip service.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.393
-Ayumi is seriously worried about--
-I didn't ask her to be!

21:55.772 --> 21:57.899
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.615
I was supposed to steal
Ayumi Kohinata's body,

22:07.701 --> 22:09.870
become Koshiro's girlfriend,

22:13.457 --> 22:19.087
and live a life free of discomfort
in my appearance and environment.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.091
But...

22:26.887 --> 22:28.013
it's all over now.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.353
I'll teach all of you people
with pretty faces and pure hearts

22:35.270 --> 22:37.564
about the absurd pain

22:38.899 --> 22:41.026
by shredding this face to pieces.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.111
Umine... don't do it!

22:43.195 --> 22:45.572
-Shut up.
-If you hurt her face, I won't let it go!

22:45.655 --> 22:46.907
Shut up!

22:50.243 --> 22:51.411
Zenko!

23:13.058 --> 23:14.017
I'm scared.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.001
I'm sorry, Zenko.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.800
I can't believe
that I pushed you this far.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.553
Why?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.810
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.191
It's too late for that now!

24:07.654 --> 24:09.322
No, it's not too late.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.908
After I changed into you,

24:14.327 --> 24:16.496
it was very lonely at first.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.377
But...

24:23.670 --> 24:25.714
when Kaga noticed me...

24:27.048 --> 24:29.801
I learned that if there is
just one person who sees you,

24:30.635 --> 24:33.722
you can be pulled out of the darkness.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.101
More pretty words--

24:38.185 --> 24:41.188
Even if it sounds pretty,
I'm being serious!

24:42.981 --> 24:43.940
Umine.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.235
I said a lot of things...

24:48.153 --> 24:50.655
but I think you've got a lot of guts.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.158
Right, Koshiro?

24:54.659 --> 24:55.494
Yeah.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.790
By risking your life...

25:03.668 --> 25:04.669
you reached us.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.684
You're not alone anymore.

25:21.394 --> 25:22.354
Umine.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.362
<i>The next day,</i>

26:14.155 --> 26:16.283
<i>during the appearance of the Red Moon,</i>

26:17.325 --> 26:19.661
<i>we carried out the plan Koshiro devised.</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:26.042
<i>Kaga and I went first.</i>

26:27.210 --> 26:28.044
<i>Then,</i>

26:28.795 --> 26:31.339
<i>Umine and Koshiro switched.</i>

26:41.641 --> 26:43.059
<i>A week later,</i>

26:44.853 --> 26:46.730
<i>on the day of the last Red Moon,</i>

26:47.480 --> 26:49.858
<i>If Koshiro and I,</i>

26:50.191 --> 26:54.112
<i>and Umine and Kaga</i>
<i>could successfully change,</i>

26:55.238 --> 26:57.115
<i>everything would be back to normal.</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:08.710
Kohinata,

27:09.377 --> 27:10.211
what is that?

27:12.672 --> 27:16.259
Kaga gave it to me before
as a protective charm.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.013
Umine,

27:21.222 --> 27:22.265
this will work, right?

27:46.039 --> 27:47.290
Yo, Koshiro,

27:48.416 --> 27:49.250
What, Kaga?

27:49.334 --> 27:51.544
We're really going back to normal, right?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.174
Do you want to stop?

27:58.051 --> 27:58.885
No.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.305
I don't want to be in someone's body.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.315
But you know,

28:12.732 --> 28:15.276
once we get back, let's not hold hands.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.486
Yeah.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.738
I don't want to be seen.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.414
Kohinata.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.216
Thank you. Ayumi.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.908
It's supposed to rain today.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.326
Bring your umbrella.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.913
I'm Ayumi!

29:57.128 --> 29:58.087
Ayumi?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.354
See you later.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.355
Have a good day.

30:23.071 --> 30:23.947
Thanks for waiting.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.032
-Good morning, Ayumi.
-You're late.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.499
Let's go. Okay.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.627
Ah, I'm starving!

30:37.752 --> 30:38.586
Already?

30:38.670 --> 30:39.796
Isn't it too early?

31:19.043 --> 31:20.044
What?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.256
Nothing.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.556
FOR SALE

32:21.940 --> 32:23.483
Goodbye,

32:23.858 --> 32:25.026
Amagase.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.597
What? You forgot your homework again?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.349
Do it yourself from time to time.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.185
Yesterday I was so busy
I couldn't even sleep.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.311
Gaming, right?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.730
You should quit. You'll fail again.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.608
All right already! Are you my mom?

33:12.740 --> 33:13.574
Oh yeah.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.035
This was in your pocket.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.163
It's yours, right?

33:21.499 --> 33:22.333
Here.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.343
Wait up, Kaga.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.692
Kaga, Koshiro.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.699
Thank you for bringing me back.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.328
But I...

34:01.581 --> 34:04.167
can't go back
to being Koshiro's girlfriend.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.131
And I can't...

34:11.758 --> 34:12.842
date Kaga.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.098
I guess...

34:21.392 --> 34:26.147
I can't go back to before...
when I didn't know anything.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.824
Sorry, Koshiro.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.952
I'm borrowing Ayumi for a bit.

34:43.873 --> 34:44.791
Wait...

34:48.878 --> 34:50.379
Hold... hold on...

34:53.549 --> 34:54.383
Huh? Kaga?

34:56.260 --> 34:58.721
You like me.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.723
But as a friend. Who...

35:07.563 --> 35:09.273
are you seriously in love with?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.780
If there's something to steal,
I'll steal it.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.450
But you know,

35:20.535 --> 35:21.994
to bring you back,

35:22.578 --> 35:24.664
he was the one who suffered the most.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.250
Don't be so careful. Make a decision!

35:33.756 --> 35:35.007
He wins completely.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.891
You don't need...

35:46.102 --> 35:47.520
that barrette anymore.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.957
Thank you.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.459
Kaga.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.131
I'm going ahead.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.028
Ayumi?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.115
What about Kaga?

36:46.287 --> 36:47.288
It's nothing.

37:46.347 --> 37:49.684
-That's not scary at all!
-You're so mean! I gave it my best shot!

37:49.767 --> 37:50.726
Am I a kappa?!

37:57.400 --> 37:58.234
Thank you.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.780
Ow! That hurts!

38:04.407 --> 38:05.241
Everyone,

38:05.658 --> 38:06.534
Fifty yen is fine.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.503
I got wrapped up in the moment
and held your hand. Lucky me!

38:21.132 --> 38:23.384
If the Red Moon day ends safely,

38:24.510 --> 38:26.137
let me answer...

38:27.680 --> 38:28.764
your feelings.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.421
Why are you dawdling?

39:00.546 --> 39:01.630
Kaga.

39:03.382 --> 39:04.925
Okay...

39:09.430 --> 39:10.264
There ya go.

39:12.767 --> 39:13.768
Get in there!

39:13.851 --> 39:15.394
Oh! Good morning, Zenko.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.646
Morning!

39:20.232 --> 39:21.067
Good morning.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.278
Your barrette's crooked.

39:24.820 --> 39:25.654
Barrette?

39:26.322 --> 39:27.323
I'll fix it for you.

39:34.789 --> 39:35.623
There.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.166
-Cute!
-Looks good.

39:37.249 --> 39:40.169
Hey, do you want to go
eat pancakes with us next time?

39:40.252 --> 39:42.755
They're this big! Come on, let's go.

39:43.297 --> 39:44.131
Yeah?

39:49.053 --> 39:51.055
-Okay.
-Yay! Hey! Someone give me your homework.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.965
Again?!

40:27.383 --> 40:28.509
Sorry!

40:28.884 --> 40:30.052
I forgot again.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.054
Thank you!

42:12.947 --> 42:14.114
By the way,

42:14.323 --> 42:16.492
when we did the shuffle,

42:16.992 --> 42:19.119
it was a good thing I was in Ayumi's body.

42:22.122 --> 42:22.957
You didn't!

42:23.040 --> 42:24.667
You think I'd let you?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.293
Bastard!

42:26.460 --> 42:28.337
You always take the good stuff!

42:28.420 --> 42:29.255
Sorry.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.174
-Koshiro! Kaga!
-Seriously?

42:33.759 --> 42:35.886
Let's all go eat strawberry parfaits.

42:38.305 --> 42:39.848
I wanted to...

42:40.516 --> 42:41.725
try it once.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.853
Yeah, we can eat strawberry parfaits,
pancakes, everything!

42:44.937 --> 42:46.480
Koshiro's treat!

42:46.730 --> 42:49.567
-Why me?
-Because you benefited the most.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.110
-Benefit?
-Actually--

42:51.902 --> 42:53.112
Kaga!

42:53.237 --> 42:55.406
He looks so composed, but--

42:55.489 --> 42:57.741
Okay, okay! My treat!

42:57.908 --> 43:00.035
-Don't talk!
-I know your weakness!

43:00.119 --> 43:02.788
Just ignore him! It's nothing at all!

43:02.871 --> 43:05.291
-Fine! I'll treat!
-My chin!

43:05.374 --> 43:07.835
You're hurting my chin!

43:09.795 --> 43:10.629
Shall we go?

43:10.754 --> 43:11.589
We're leaving.

43:11.672 --> 43:14.174
-But you know, this guy--
-Kaga!

43:14.258 --> 43:15.676
Let's go!

43:15.759 --> 43:18.178
I'm paying so eat as much
as you want! Okay?!

43:18.804 --> 43:20.723
-Kaga!
-Sorry!

43:20.806 --> 43:21.890
Ignore him!

43:21.974 --> 43:24.685
Kaga, hurry up and get moving!
