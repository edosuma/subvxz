Hey, guys.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.571
Christmas is coming up, so
here's my Christmas wish list.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.742
I would've put it on an iPad
Mini, but I do not have one.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.979
And I want a Gucci purse,
because I'm black or Italian.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.267
I did not raise a house
full of public radio stations.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.769
Nobody is getting
anything for Christmas

01:10.771 --> 01:12.237
until they give
something back.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.672
Givin' back!

01:13.674 --> 01:15.274

we're all volunteering

01:15.276 --> 01:16.708

01:16.710 --> 01:18.077
Pass.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.913
Then you most definitely
will not get that purse.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.015
Gaudy materialism!

01:23.017 --> 01:24.950
Fine. Then
I'll get a job.

Don't use me

The rest of you,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.755
go up to your rooms

blue pants and red thongs!

Hey, sir, we came down
to help feed the homeless.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.405
Did you bring forks?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.473
Uh...

01:47.475 --> 01:48.941
(chuckles):
Just kidding.

01:48.943 --> 01:49.942
They don't use forks.

Are they Chinese?

Choppysticky?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.645
(laughs)

01:53.647 --> 01:55.380
Just get in the kitchen
and help.

Okay. Bye.

Boo-boos.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.996
Mm. I'm so hungry, I could eat
a sandwich meant for a peasant.

Yes.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.651
To squat and pinch off
seven sandwiches

04:45.653 --> 04:47.319

Yeah.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.062
I don't know what I...

07:44.064 --> 07:46.765

07:48.502 --> 07:51.336

What?!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.280
Well, (bleep)!

10:49.282 --> 10:51.316
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.984
(sighs)

10:55.921 --> 10:59.424
Sorry, Roberta,
but even a pallet ride

10:59.426 --> 11:02.027
around the yard
can't cheer me up.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.528
Maybe this will.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.096
I tricked her out.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.699
A new coat of paint,
stainless steel runners

11:07.701 --> 11:10.535
and hydraulics that can carry
half a ton of presents

11:10.537 --> 11:12.203
and half a ton of you.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.105
Why did you do this?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.841
Look, you remembered
what I wanted ten years ago.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.877
That's who
should be Santa.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.980
Not that monotone jerk
who buys us beer.

11:21.982 --> 11:25.550
Roberta, Mr. Grundle
already told me no.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.552
You can't let sexism
get in your way.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.521
Stand up to him.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.856
I can't stand up!

11:31.858 --> 11:33.224
Whatever.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.060
I'm done with getting
my hopes up,

11:35.062 --> 11:37.996
and I'm done with Christmas.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.599
This is why I've never
spoken to you before this week.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.837
Junior, we're off
to Grundle's.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.972
I really do wish
I could come,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.908
but they're short-handed
at the shelter.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.176
That's okay.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.510
The kids and I will be fine.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.012
You're doing a great thing.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.381
Well...
Proud of you.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.283
(giggles) Tickles.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.920
Merry Christmas.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.556
I'm Ari Cohen,
filling in for everyone.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.158
Tonight, we'll be
crowning our annual...

12:07.160 --> 12:09.094
Christmas Angel?

12:09.096 --> 12:10.328
Whatever.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.763
But first, let's check in

12:11.765 --> 12:14.833
with the Grundle's
Xmas Xtravaganza.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.435
And, in an effort to appeal
to younger viewers,

12:17.437 --> 12:21.406
we go to a rapping vampire,
live on the scene.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.042
♪ I'm sorry to report
there's no Christmas cheer ♪

12:24.044 --> 12:26.277
♪ 'Cause Santa Claus
is nowhere near ♪

12:26.279 --> 12:28.747
♪ The kids are crying,
the parents are... ♪

12:28.749 --> 12:30.782
This is ridiculous.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.685
I've been doing this
for 130 years.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.186
What happened to the days

12:35.188 --> 12:37.355
when a vampire
could just read the news?

12:37.357 --> 12:40.525
Anyway, Santa's a no-show
and the kids are upset.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.261
It looks like Christmas
is canceled.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.130
Santa forgot Stoolbend.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.899
Where are you, Santa?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.434
(children sobbing)

12:49.436 --> 12:51.269
No Santa?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.238
Roberta was right.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.608
It's up to me to save Christmas.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.881
Hold on, childrens.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.450
Santa's coming.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.296
(screaming)

13:20.232 --> 13:21.666
Oh, no! Oh, no!

13:21.668 --> 13:24.469
Wait, I know.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.272
Rascal, rise!

13:27.274 --> 13:28.807
Oh, well.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.075
I've done everything
humanly possible.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.677
Good-bye, world.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.479
You were delicious.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.519
Don't want.
Don't want. Don't want.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.154
Holy crap! London Fog!

13:43.156 --> 13:46.024
Now it's time
for our Christmas Angel Award.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.860
This year's winner
was nominated by his wife

13:48.862 --> 13:51.696
for his work
at the Stoolbend Shelter.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.165
That's where we are. Cool!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.633
Desk lamp?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.135
Give it to me!
I need that!

13:57.137 --> 14:00.271
We go there now
as this unsuspecting angel

14:00.273 --> 14:02.607
is about to get his wings.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.277
Hey. Look.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.980
I'm... on... TV!

14:08.982 --> 14:10.815
Give me that camera!

14:10.817 --> 14:12.283
I'm homeless!
I want it!

14:12.285 --> 14:14.452
Cleveland, you're pretending
to be homeless?

14:14.454 --> 14:16.287
Yes.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.524
But I've continued
to wash down there.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.359
Hmm? Tonight?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.727
No?

14:22.729 --> 14:24.295
But it's Christmas.

14:28.968 --> 14:32.337
BOY:
Cleveland Brown sucks!

14:32.339 --> 14:35.506
You give a homeless guy
a sandwich, and you're a hero.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.477
You take a homeless guy's hero,
and suddenly you're a sandwich.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.912
Well!

14:40.914 --> 14:43.748
Cleveland,
a word-- now.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.650
Well, we had a
good run, buddy.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.253
I'd love to say we'll keep
in touch after the divorce,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.922
but I'm not one for
lying on Christmas.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.224
You have completely ruined
this family's good name.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.261
You will apologize
and make this right.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.929
Okay.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.831
CLEVELAND:
Good morning,
members of the press

14:59.833 --> 15:01.833
and unwashed bloggers.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.601
I stand here in a dark suit

15:03.603 --> 15:06.771
with my lawyer by my side
and my wife behind me,

15:06.773 --> 15:09.173
barely able to conceal her anger

15:09.175 --> 15:11.943
as she nods dutifully
to show support,

15:11.945 --> 15:15.280
so that I can publicly
apologize for my actions.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.715
What I did at the shelter
was wrong.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.617
It was low down.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.085
Way low down.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.087
Like a midget.
(crowd gasping)

15:23.089 --> 15:25.356
(indistinct
whispering)
Really?

15:26.892 --> 15:30.128
And while trying to apologize
for my actions,

15:30.130 --> 15:32.764
I insulted little people,
which was wrong.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.133
It was worse
than interracial marriage.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.534
(indistinct
whispering)

15:36.536 --> 15:38.369
Serious?
Isn't that in the Bible book?

15:39.538 --> 15:40.972
Without interracial couples,

15:40.974 --> 15:42.974
we wouldn't have Halle Berry.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.944
So, obviously,
I can't be against that.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.147
I'm not some drunk Indian
on the rez.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.349
I knew it when I said it.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.819
If you Native Americans
had even

15:54.821 --> 15:57.121
the most basic system
of ownership,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.123
none of this
would have happened.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.293
Anyway, it's not as if you're
a bunch of low-life pervs

16:02.295 --> 16:04.929
lurking in chat rooms
to pick up underage boys.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.130
(indistinct
whispering)

16:06.132 --> 16:08.066
No way!
You've got to be kid...

16:08.068 --> 16:11.402
CLEVELAND:
And while I cannot support
your man-boy love,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.471
I appreciate
that you'd allow me

16:13.473 --> 16:15.573
to continue my apology tour.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.942
Please know that I am sorry.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.546
Me so belly, belly solly.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.590
(groans)

16:39.498 --> 16:41.799
Hey, Brown.
Where you been?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.669
I just wanted to come by
and apologize.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.636
For what?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.872
For pretending I was homeless.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.607
Did that happen
one minute ago?

16:49.609 --> 16:50.708
No.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.776
Then I forgot about it.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.977
Ha! You fried.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.612
Hungry?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.115
This is just government cheese

16:57.117 --> 17:00.284
and nonorganic
processed ham food.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.986
What happened
to this place?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.188
This is what it's like
the rest of the year.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.690
Christmas
is the only time

17:05.692 --> 17:08.559
anyone in this town
gives a crap.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.328
You know what?

17:10.330 --> 17:13.064
We need to talk some sense
into this town.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.732
We're going
to Grundle's.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.034
Right now?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.201
What, you got
a tee time?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.703
"Tee" standing
for "trash"?

17:18.705 --> 17:19.971
(laughs)
Just teasing.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.472
Y'all bums
come on.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.076
Hey, is that a wheel?

17:25.078 --> 17:26.411
(engine whirring)

17:26.413 --> 17:29.313
Three more,
and we can build a wagon,

17:29.315 --> 17:31.749
which we could sell
for drugs.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.751
(all grunting)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.086
Kendra!

17:35.088 --> 17:36.521
Are you okay?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.089
(exhales)

17:38.091 --> 17:40.158
I've got to get
to Grundle's.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.226
That's where
we're going.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.862
It's a Christmas
miracle or something.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.431
(motor sputters)

17:46.433 --> 17:47.765
You'll have to pull me.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.900
With what?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.735
I have a rope.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.938
It's too dark.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.106
I can't see a thing.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.340
I can help.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.910
Here goes 20 minutes
of sobriety.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.624
Hyah! Hyah!

18:13.626 --> 18:16.427
Hmm, I wonder
if I'm Dasher or Prancer.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.296
ALL: Prancer.
CLEVELAND: Wha...?

18:22.234 --> 18:24.202
It's after Christmas,

18:24.204 --> 18:26.204
and I still have
to wear the shorts?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.605
Mr. Grundle,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.974
why do all the men
get to wear long pants?

18:29.976 --> 18:32.043
I don't hire boys
to see their legs,

18:32.045 --> 18:34.479
and I don't hire girls
to hear them talk.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.813
(loud crash)

18:35.815 --> 18:37.782
(crowd gasps and murmurs)

18:37.784 --> 18:39.383
Ho ho ho!

18:39.385 --> 18:41.986
Merry Christmas!

18:41.988 --> 18:44.222
Santa!

18:44.224 --> 18:46.491
Santa, we thought
you forgot us.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.559
Oh, I didn't forget you.

18:48.561 --> 18:52.130
Mrs. Claus had a hysterectomy,
and I had to be there.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.933
But thanks to an elf
who never gave up on me,

18:55.935 --> 18:59.170
I'm finally here
where I belong.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.806
Now, who wants presents?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.641
We do!
(children cheering)

19:03.643 --> 19:05.510
Uh-oh.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.346
Uh, everyone just take
one thing from the store

19:08.348 --> 19:10.648
and walk out quietly
and confidently.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.783
They can't stop all of you.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.285
(children cheering)

19:14.287 --> 19:16.521
The day after
Christmas is saved.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.322
Back to work,
Hot Legs.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.024
You know what,
Mr. Grundle?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.826
I'm sick
of your sexist ways.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.094
Okay.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.362
I quit.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.597
And if you like
these shorts so much,

19:26.599 --> 19:28.666
why don't you wear them
yourself?

19:33.338 --> 19:37.308
We will no longer
be objectified.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.844
(wind whistling)

19:39.846 --> 19:41.345
(all shivering)

19:41.347 --> 19:43.614
Come on, let's
keep warm.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.520
Good people of Stoolbend,
hear me speak.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.389
MAN:
Hey, it's the guy who
stole from the homeless.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.990
WOMAN:
Undeserved
Christmas angel!

19:52.992 --> 19:55.059
MAN:
Sandwich Grinch!

19:55.061 --> 19:56.727
I've tried to apologize

19:56.729 --> 19:59.297
for many things recently
and failed,

19:59.299 --> 20:03.634
but I come to you now
for one last apology-- yours.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.370
For one week every year,

20:06.372 --> 20:08.406
you open your closets,
your wallets

20:08.408 --> 20:10.374
and your hearts
to the less fortunate,

20:10.376 --> 20:12.643
but the moment Christmas
is over,

20:12.645 --> 20:15.913
you forget all about
these smellies.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.917
I say, let's treat the homeless
as if every day were Christmas.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.852
Or Chanukah.

20:21.854 --> 20:25.656
So let's all apologize
to the homeless.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.159
I'm sorry.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.527
It's a juicer.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.928
I have no use for this.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.330
You're welcome.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.267
Cleveland, you may have
done the wrong thing,

20:36.269 --> 20:38.069
and then several more
wrong things

20:38.071 --> 20:39.904
trying to correct
that wrong thing,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.240
but you made up
for it all

20:42.242 --> 20:44.242
with a small
token gesture

20:44.244 --> 20:46.777
that required
no personal sacrifice.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.113
I did, didn't I?

20:49.115 --> 20:52.016
Baby, I'm the greatest.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.386
So I guess this
is good-bye forever.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.622
You could still
come see us.
No.
