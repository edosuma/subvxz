Mr. Dufresne,

02:07.868 --> 02:12.121
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

02:16.752 --> 02:18.878
It was very bitter.

02:18.962 --> 02:23.382
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

02:24.802 --> 02:28.346
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

02:28.430 --> 02:30.264
What was your response?

02:30.349 --> 02:32.308
I told her I would not grant one.

02:32.392 --> 02:35.436
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

02:35.521 --> 02:39.190
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

02:40.317 --> 02:43.986
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

02:45.114 --> 02:48.616
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.618
She packed a bag.

02:51.703 --> 02:54.872
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

02:59.503 --> 03:03.381
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

03:05.134 --> 03:06.509
Did you follow her?

03:07.761 --> 03:09.929
I went to a few bars first.

03:10.013 --> 03:12.890
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

03:12.975 --> 03:16.561
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

03:16.645 --> 03:18.229
and waited.

03:18.313 --> 03:20.523
<font color="#808080">DA :</font> With what intention?

03:22.484 --> 03:24.694
I was confused.

Drunk.

03:28.198 --> 03:31.200
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

03:31.285 --> 03:34.537
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

03:34.621 --> 03:37.707
No. I was sobering up.

03:37.791 --> 03:40.543
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

03:40.627 --> 03:44.088
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

03:44.173 --> 03:46.382
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

03:46.466 --> 03:50.261
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

03:50.345 --> 03:56.017
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

03:57.060 --> 04:01.314
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

04:01.398 --> 04:03.232
<font color="#ff00ff">(Whispers)</font> Yes, it does.

04:03.317 --> 04:09.405
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

04:09.489 --> 04:13.284
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

04:13.368 --> 04:18.079
<font color="#808080">DA :</font> The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

04:18.165 --> 04:20.958
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

04:21.043 --> 04:25.213
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

04:26.506 --> 04:29.383
And that also...

04:29.468 --> 04:31.469
is very convenient.

04:31.553 --> 04:33.054
Isn’t it, Mr. Dufresne?

04:34.264 --> 04:36.515
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

04:36.600 --> 04:40.186
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

as to merit a death sentence?</i>

05:30.153 --> 05:32.238
Now, while you think about that...

05:33.949 --> 05:36.450
..think about this.

05:36.535 --> 05:39.078
A revolver holds six bullets.

05:39.162 --> 05:40.538
Not eight.

05:40.622 --> 05:44.083
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.211
That could be understood, if not condoned.

05:47.296 --> 05:49.922
No. This was revenge...

05:50.007 --> 05:54.510
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

05:54.594 --> 05:57.138

05:57.222 --> 05:59.598
<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.</i>

05:59.683 --> 06:03.602
<i>That means that he fired the gun empty,</i>

06:03.687 --> 06:05.980
<i>and then stopped to reload...</i>

06:07.065 --> 06:09.650
<i>..so that he could shoot each of them again.</i>

06:09.735 --> 06:12.320
<i>An extra bullet per lover.</i>

It chills my blood just to look at you.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.736
Ten it is.

27:45.822 --> 27:48.240
Waste of money, if you ask me.

27:48.324 --> 27:49.866
Why's that?

27:50.952 --> 27:53.995
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

27:55.581 --> 27:57.874
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

If you want to keep the money,

36:12.771 --> 36:14.313
Bullshit! Tax-free?

36:14.314 --> 36:17.483

You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

36:20.237 --> 36:23.781
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

36:23.866 --> 36:25.366
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

36:25.451 --> 36:28.661
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

36:28.746 --> 36:31.039
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

36:31.123 --> 36:35.209
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.337
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

36:38.422 --> 36:40.298
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

36:40.382 --> 36:42.717
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

36:42.801 --> 36:46.637

43:42.679 --> 43:43.762

In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

43:52.230 --> 43:57.026

So...

54:15.805 --> 54:18.307
Mr. Dekins...

54:18.391 --> 54:22.853
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

54:22.937 --> 54:25.063
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

54:25.148 --> 54:27.816
As God is my witness, he did!

54:27.900 --> 54:31.278
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

54:31.362 --> 54:33.238
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

54:33.323 --> 54:34.698
My ass!

54:34.782 --> 54:35.991
Shook his hand.

Hell, I...I near soiled myself! <font color="#ff00ff">(Laughs)</font>

54:39.120 --> 54:43.332
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

54:43.416 --> 54:44.750
and he would have been:

54:44.834 --> 54:46.376
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

54:46.461 --> 54:48.211

54:49.255 --> 54:51.214

54:59.807 --> 55:02.017
Well, it might do more than that.

55:02.101 --> 55:05.103
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

55:05.188 --> 55:07.898
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

55:07.982 --> 55:10.442
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

55:10.526 --> 55:15.781

Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

55:15.865 --> 55:17.616

Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

55:26.125 --> 55:27.834
Not one of them born...

55:27.835 --> 55:32.798
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

55:32.882 --> 55:35.175
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

55:35.259 --> 55:36.510
I see.

55:36.594 --> 55:40.138
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

55:40.223 --> 55:44.601
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

55:44.685 --> 55:46.770
more walls, more bars and more guards.

55:46.854 --> 55:51.274
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

55:51.359 --> 55:52.901
Sure can.

55:52.985 --> 55:55.862
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

55:55.947 --> 55:58.240
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

56:00.159 --> 56:03.203
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> So, Andy started writing a letter a week,</i>

56:03.287 --> 56:05.372
<i>just like he said.</i>

56:09.419 --> 56:13.547
<i>And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.</i>

56:21.389 --> 56:26.893
<i>The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.</i>

56:26.978 --> 56:30.063
<i>The year after that, he did them all...</i>

56:30.148 --> 56:32.232
<i>including the Warden's.</i>

56:33.609 --> 56:37.362
<i>The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season</i>

56:37.447 --> 56:39.531
<i>to coincide with tax season.</i>

56:41.826 --> 56:46.037
<i>The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.</i>

56:46.122 --> 56:50.250
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

56:50.334 --> 56:52.085
Damn right. The holster, too.

56:52.170 --> 56:53.420
That's tax-deductible.

56:53.504 --> 56:54.671
You can write that off.

56:54.755 --> 56:58.091
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> Yes, sir.

56:58.176 --> 57:01.219

57:11.481 --> 57:14.858
<i>And still...he kept sending those letters.</i>

57:20.156 --> 57:21.990

You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

57:34.962 --> 57:37.422
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

57:37.507 --> 57:39.633
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

57:39.717 --> 57:41.426
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

57:41.511 --> 57:43.386
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

57:43.471 --> 57:45.597
It's what they done!

57:45.681 --> 57:47.098
I...I got no choice...

57:47.183 --> 57:49.851
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

57:49.936 --> 57:52.562
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

57:52.647 --> 57:56.066
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:56.775
30 years.

01:13:57.861 --> 01:13:59.904
Jesus, when they say it like that...

01:13:59.988 --> 01:14:02.072
You wonder where it went.

01:14:05.035 --> 01:14:07.119
I wonder where ten years went.

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:13.459

01:14:13.543 --> 01:14:15.711

I hope you don't mind.

01:14:23.553 --> 01:14:25.638

Uh-uh.

You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

01:17:38.206 --> 01:17:42.209

<i>It made all the papers

No free ride.

01:18:21.332 --> 01:18:24.293
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

01:18:24.377 --> 01:18:26.545

01:18:27.589 --> 01:18:29.923

These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

01:18:39.017 --> 01:18:42.686
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

01:18:42.771 --> 01:18:47.983

01:18:48.067 --> 01:18:50.736
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> Of course,

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:54.114

<i>And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.</i>

01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:06.084
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:08.337
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:10.464
you can underbid any contractor in town.

01:19:10.548 --> 01:19:14.510
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

01:19:14.594 --> 01:19:16.845
Well, that's fine for the papers

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.430
but I've got a family to feed.

01:19:18.515 --> 01:19:20.224
Sam...

01:19:20.308 --> 01:19:22.768
Sam, we go back a long way.

01:19:22.852 --> 01:19:25.187
I need this new highway contract.

01:19:25.271 --> 01:19:27.481
I don't get it, and I go under.

01:19:27.565 --> 01:19:29.608
That's a fact.

01:19:29.692 --> 01:19:31.777
You just have some of this fine pie

01:19:31.861 --> 01:19:33.904
my missus made especially for you,

01:19:33.988 --> 01:19:35.322
and you think about that.

01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:46.291
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:49.586
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

01:19:51.464 --> 01:19:54.049

Night drops as always, sir.

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:42.180
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:20:42.265 --> 01:20:45.058
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:45.143 --> 01:20:48.896
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.981
How do I look?

01:20:51.065 --> 01:20:53.775
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:55.569

Thank you, sir.

01:21:06.539 --> 01:21:10.292
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

01:21:10.376 --> 01:21:12.836
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

01:21:12.921 --> 01:21:14.963
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

01:21:15.048 --> 01:21:17.925
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

01:21:18.009 --> 01:21:21.261
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

01:21:21.346 --> 01:21:23.931
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

01:21:24.015 --> 01:21:26.516
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

01:21:26.601 --> 01:21:29.144
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

01:21:29.228 --> 01:21:31.897
I send that money out into the real world.

01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:35.609
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

01:21:35.693 --> 01:21:36.902
Cleaner.

01:21:36.986 --> 01:21:40.614
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

01:21:43.368 --> 01:21:47.788
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

01:21:47.872 --> 01:21:51.124
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

01:21:51.209 --> 01:21:54.503
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

01:21:54.587 --> 01:21:57.589
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

01:21:57.674 --> 01:22:00.509
it's gonna lead to somebody.

01:22:00.593 --> 01:22:02.552
Sure it is. But not to me.

01:22:02.637 --> 01:22:04.638
And certainly not to the Warden.

01:22:08.685 --> 01:22:09.977
All right. Who?

01:22:10.061 --> 01:22:11.770
Randall Stevens.

01:22:11.854 --> 01:22:13.021
Who?

01:22:14.107 --> 01:22:18.819
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

01:22:18.903 --> 01:22:21.071
That's where the filtering process starts.

01:22:21.155 --> 01:22:24.324
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

01:22:24.409 --> 01:22:25.993
But who is he?

01:22:26.077 --> 01:22:28.120
He's a phantom, an apparition.

01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:30.163
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

01:22:30.248 --> 01:22:32.416
I conjured him...

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.543
out of thin air.

01:22:34.627 --> 01:22:37.462
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

01:22:40.591 --> 01:22:42.968
Andy, you can’t just make a person up.

01:22:43.052 --> 01:22:46.179
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

01:22:46.264 --> 01:22:49.766
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

01:22:49.851 --> 01:22:52.477
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

01:22:52.562 --> 01:22:54.896
a driver's license, social security number.

01:22:54.981 --> 01:22:56.189
You're shitting me?

01:22:56.274 --> 01:22:58.233
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

01:22:58.317 --> 01:23:01.194
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

01:23:01.279 --> 01:23:03.363
Well, I'll be damned.

01:23:04.657 --> 01:23:06.700
Did I say you were good?

01:23:06.784 --> 01:23:08.952
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

01:23:09.037 --> 01:23:11.079
You know, the funny thing is,

01:23:11.164 --> 01:23:15.125
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

01:23:16.169 --> 01:23:18.545
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

01:23:27.305 --> 01:23:28.680
Ever bother you?

01:23:29.724 --> 01:23:33.143
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

01:23:33.227 --> 01:23:35.270
Fine line maybe but...

01:23:35.354 --> 01:23:38.065
I also built that library

01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:40.776
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.736
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.572
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

01:23:45.656 --> 01:23:47.783
Money instead of sheets.

01:23:47.867 --> 01:23:50.577
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

01:25:08.489 --> 01:25:09.906
Not like here.

01:25:09.991 --> 01:25:12.325
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:17.497
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

01:25:17.582 --> 01:25:21.585
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:26.756
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

01:25:26.841 --> 01:25:30.677
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:32.512
What are you in for?

01:25:32.597 --> 01:25:34.222
Me?

01:25:35.725 --> 01:25:37.809
The lawyer fucked me.

01:25:41.522 --> 01:25:44.941
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

a young wife and a new baby girl.</i>

01:25:57.622 --> 01:26:02.751
<i>Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.</i>

01:26:02.835 --> 01:26:06.671
<i>Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.</i>

01:26:10.635 --> 01:26:13.887
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:16.556
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

01:26:17.767 --> 01:26:19.976
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

01:26:21.562 --> 01:26:23.647
I ain't no goddamn loser.

01:26:25.483 --> 01:26:27.567
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

01:26:29.237 --> 01:26:31.279
You really mean that?

01:26:31.364 --> 01:26:33.031
Yes, sir, I do.

01:26:33.115 --> 01:26:35.242
Good. Because if we do this,

01:26:35.326 --> 01:26:38.078
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

01:26:39.205 --> 01:26:41.289
The thing is, see...

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.292
..I don't read so good.

01:26:45.419 --> 01:26:46.628
Well.

01:26:48.381 --> 01:26:50.423
You don't read...

01:26:50.508 --> 01:26:52.592
so well.

01:26:54.053 --> 01:26:55.720
We'll get to that.

01:26:56.806 --> 01:26:58.556
- R.
- R...

01:27:02.353 --> 01:27:04.771

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.025
<i>Tommy took to it pretty well, too.</i>

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:12.070
<i>The boy found brains he never knew he had.</i>

01:27:14.407 --> 01:27:18.201
<i>Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.</i>

01:27:18.286 --> 01:27:20.245
<i>He really liked the kid.</i>

01:27:20.329 --> 01:27:23.498
<i>It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.</i>

01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:26.584
<i>But that wasn't the only reason.</i>

01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:29.129
<i>Prison time is slow time.</i>

01:27:30.172 --> 01:27:32.424

<i>Tommy was it.</i>

01:27:46.105 --> 01:27:50.317
<i>It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.</i>

01:27:50.401 --> 01:27:54.029
<i>The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.</i>

Well?

01:28:34.779 --> 01:28:36.321
Well, it's for shit.

01:28:36.405 --> 01:28:38.907
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:42.160
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

01:28:42.244 --> 01:28:45.955
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.541
Let's see how the score comes out.

01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:51.252
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

01:28:53.047 --> 01:28:54.964
Two points right there.

01:28:55.049 --> 01:28:56.841
There's your goddamn score!

01:28:56.926 --> 01:29:00.762
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

01:29:01.847 --> 01:29:03.390
Fuck this place!

01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:04.682
Fuck it!

01:29:23.494 --> 01:29:26.246
I feel bad. I let him down.

01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:28.415
Ah, that's crap, kid.

01:29:28.416 --> 01:29:29.958
He's proud of you.

01:29:30.042 --> 01:29:33.169
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

01:29:33.254 --> 01:29:36.131
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

01:29:36.215 --> 01:29:38.258
He used to be a banker on the outside.

01:29:38.342 --> 01:29:40.385
What's he in here for, anyway?

01:29:40.469 --> 01:29:41.970
Murder.

01:29:43.097 --> 01:29:44.848
The hell you say!

01:29:46.976 --> 01:29:49.269
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

01:29:50.312 --> 01:29:52.772
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

01:29:52.857 --> 01:29:54.941
He greased them both.

01:30:02.825 --> 01:30:04.701
What?

01:30:04.785 --> 01:30:07.162
About four years ago,

01:30:07.246 --> 01:30:10.331
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

01:30:11.584 --> 01:30:14.669
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

01:30:15.963 --> 01:30:18.006
About six months left to go,

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:20.133
I get a new cellmate in.

01:30:20.217 --> 01:30:22.093
Elmo Blatch.

01:30:23.137 --> 01:30:24.721
Big, twitchy fucker.

01:30:24.722 --> 01:30:27.015
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

01:30:27.099 --> 01:30:29.142
You know what I'm saying?

01:30:29.226 --> 01:30:31.269
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

01:30:31.353 --> 01:30:34.564
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

01:30:34.648 --> 01:30:36.524
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

01:30:36.609 --> 01:30:39.611
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

01:30:40.738 --> 01:30:42.780
Talked all the time, too.

01:30:42.865 --> 01:30:45.200
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

01:30:45.284 --> 01:30:47.327
Places he'd been in,

01:30:47.411 --> 01:30:50.079
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

01:30:50.164 --> 01:30:52.582
Even people he'd killed.

01:30:54.418 --> 01:30:56.794
People who gave him shit.

01:30:57.838 --> 01:30:59.881
That's how he put it.

01:30:59.965 --> 01:31:01.508
So...

01:31:01.592 --> 01:31:03.676
one night, like a joke,

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.014
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

01:31:08.098 --> 01:31:09.891
So he says...

01:31:09.975 --> 01:31:13.603
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:18.316
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

01:31:20.736 --> 01:31:22.737
So I pick out this guy,

01:31:23.781 --> 01:31:26.366
go in one night and do his place.

01:31:28.536 --> 01:31:30.537
He wakes up.

01:31:30.621 --> 01:31:32.664
He gives me shit.

01:31:33.707 --> 01:31:35.792
So I killed him.

01:31:36.835 --> 01:31:38.920
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:43.132
That's the best part.

01:31:44.176 --> 01:31:47.387
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

01:31:47.471 --> 01:31:49.556
But she's married to some other guy.

01:31:50.599 --> 01:31:52.684
Some hotshot banker.

01:31:54.478 --> 01:31:56.563
And he's the one they pinned it on.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.536
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

01:32:13.163 --> 01:32:16.040
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:17.750
Sir?

01:32:17.835 --> 01:32:19.502
Well...

01:32:19.587 --> 01:32:22.964
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

01:32:23.048 --> 01:32:25.133
He hears your tale of woe

01:32:25.217 --> 01:32:28.136
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.263
He's young, not terribly bright.

01:32:30.347 --> 01:32:34.225
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:36.436
Sir, he's telling the truth.

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.565
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

01:32:40.649 --> 01:32:43.776
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

01:32:43.861 --> 01:32:46.070
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

01:32:46.155 --> 01:32:48.364
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

01:32:48.449 --> 01:32:51.618
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

01:32:51.702 --> 01:32:54.912
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

01:32:54.997 --> 01:32:57.040
The chances are he'd be released by now.

01:32:57.124 --> 01:32:59.709
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

01:32:59.793 --> 01:33:01.961
There's a chance, isn't there?

01:33:04.006 --> 01:33:05.882
How can you be so obtuse?

01:33:05.966 --> 01:33:07.467
What?

01:33:08.969 --> 01:33:10.803
What did you call me?

01:33:10.888 --> 01:33:12.722
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

01:33:12.806 --> 01:33:14.599
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

01:33:14.683 --> 01:33:17.518
The country club will have his old timecards,

01:33:17.603 --> 01:33:19.729
records, W-2s,

01:33:19.813 --> 01:33:23.816
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

01:33:23.901 --> 01:33:27.862
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

01:33:27.946 --> 01:33:32.950
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

01:33:34.745 --> 01:33:37.747
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

01:33:37.831 --> 01:33:39.707
Not in this office.

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:41.834
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

01:33:41.919 --> 01:33:45.171
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

01:33:45.255 --> 01:33:46.631
Solitary. A month.

01:33:46.715 --> 01:33:48.883
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

01:33:48.967 --> 01:33:52.220
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see that?

01:33:52.221 --> 01:33:54.222
It's my life! Don't you understand?

01:33:54.306 --> 01:33:56.766
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:58.101
No!

01:33:58.185 --> 01:34:00.019
A month in the hole.

01:34:00.104 --> 01:34:02.689
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

01:34:02.773 --> 01:34:04.565
It's all my fault.

01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:06.067
Oh, bullshit.

01:34:06.151 --> 01:34:09.445
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:11.906
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:14.158
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:14.243 --> 01:34:16.285
It looks that way.

01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:18.413
Sweet Jesus.

01:34:18.497 --> 01:34:20.540
How long's he been here now?

01:34:20.624 --> 01:34:22.667
1947. What is that?

01:34:22.751 --> 01:34:24.293
- 19 years.

- Yeah.

01:34:32.845 --> 01:34:35.763

Board of Education.

01:34:35.848 --> 01:34:38.516
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.644
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

01:34:41.729 --> 01:34:43.813
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

01:34:44.857 --> 01:34:47.608
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

01:34:48.652 --> 01:34:50.862
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

01:34:51.905 --> 01:34:53.990
Hey, Red!

01:34:55.117 --> 01:34:57.535
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

01:35:03.125 --> 01:35:05.209
Well, shit.

01:35:17.431 --> 01:35:20.141
The kid passed. C+ average.

01:35:20.225 --> 01:35:22.310
Thought you'd like to know.

01:35:38.869 --> 01:35:40.953
The Warden wants to talk.

01:35:54.343 --> 01:35:55.468
Out here?

01:35:55.552 --> 01:35:57.637
That's what the man said.

01:36:13.946 --> 01:36:15.738
Warden?

01:36:15.823 --> 01:36:17.907
Tommy.

01:36:23.372 --> 01:36:24.831
Tommy...

01:36:24.915 --> 01:36:29.001
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.505
I feel awkward enough as it is.

01:36:50.983 --> 01:36:53.067
We got a situation here.

01:36:54.111 --> 01:36:56.153
I think you can appreciate that.

01:36:56.238 --> 01:36:57.697
Yes, sir.

01:36:57.781 --> 01:36:59.282
I sure can.

01:36:59.366 --> 01:37:03.411
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

01:37:05.122 --> 01:37:07.665
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

01:37:09.877 --> 01:37:11.961
The right thing to do.

01:37:13.297 --> 01:37:16.299
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:20.052
You understand?

01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:23.514
I need your help, son.

01:37:24.933 --> 01:37:27.018
If I'm going to move on this,

01:37:27.019 --> 01:37:29.770
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

01:37:31.315 --> 01:37:34.734
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

01:37:34.818 --> 01:37:36.402
Yes, sir.

01:37:36.403 --> 01:37:38.029
Absolutely.

01:37:38.113 --> 01:37:41.198
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

01:37:41.283 --> 01:37:43.701
having placed your hand on the Good Book

01:37:43.702 --> 01:37:46.412
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

01:37:46.496 --> 01:37:48.623
Just give me that chance.

01:37:52.544 --> 01:37:54.211
That's what I thought.

01:38:26.662 --> 01:38:28.746
<font color="#ff00ff">(Keys rattle)</font>

01:38:41.301 --> 01:38:43.386
I'm sure by now you've heard...

01:38:44.638 --> 01:38:46.013
A terrible thing.

01:38:47.474 --> 01:38:51.060
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

01:38:52.145 --> 01:38:54.772
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

01:38:55.816 --> 01:38:57.900
Truly, it did.

01:38:59.945 --> 01:39:02.029
We just have to put it behind us.

01:39:04.199 --> 01:39:05.616
Move on.

01:39:07.077 --> 01:39:08.953
I'm done.

01:39:09.997 --> 01:39:12.081
Everything stops.

01:39:13.125 --> 01:39:15.960
Get someone else to run your scams.

01:39:17.295 --> 01:39:19.380
Nothing stops.

01:39:20.424 --> 01:39:22.508
Nothing.

01:39:24.261 --> 01:39:26.345
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

01:39:28.223 --> 01:39:30.808
No more protection from the guards.

01:39:30.892 --> 01:39:33.227
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

01:39:33.311 --> 01:39:35.479
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

01:39:37.232 --> 01:39:39.734
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

01:39:41.028 --> 01:39:43.070
And the library?

01:39:43.155 --> 01:39:44.280
Gone.

01:39:44.364 --> 01:39:46.741
Sealed off, brick by brick.

01:39:47.784 --> 01:39:50.578
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

01:39:50.662 --> 01:39:52.705
They'll see the flames for miles.

01:39:52.789 --> 01:39:55.291
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

01:39:56.877 --> 01:39:58.794
You understand me?

01:39:58.879 --> 01:40:00.963
Catching my drift?

01:40:04.051 --> 01:40:06.135
Or am I being obtuse?

01:40:17.272 --> 01:40:19.398
Give him another month to think about it.

01:40:27.908 --> 01:40:29.992
<font color="#ff00ff">(Lock clicks)</font>

01:41:06.988 --> 01:41:10.032
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

01:41:10.117 --> 01:41:12.201
Like a closed book.

01:41:13.411 --> 01:41:16.163
Complained about it all the time.

01:41:16.248 --> 01:41:18.332
She was beautiful.

01:41:20.544 --> 01:41:22.628
God, I loved her.

01:41:25.632 --> 01:41:27.967
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:32.555
I killed her, Red.

01:41:34.015 --> 01:41:36.100
I didn't pull the trigger.

01:41:37.519 --> 01:41:39.603
But I drove her away.

01:41:40.814 --> 01:41:43.357
That's why she died, because of me.

01:41:43.441 --> 01:41:45.526
The way I am.

01:41:53.869 --> 01:41:55.953
That don't make you a murderer.

01:41:59.166 --> 01:42:01.250
A bad husband, maybe.

01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:08.007
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

01:42:08.091 --> 01:42:09.508
No, I didn't.

01:42:09.593 --> 01:42:11.635
Somebody else did.

01:42:12.929 --> 01:42:15.014
And I wound up in here.

01:42:17.392 --> 01:42:19.476
Bad luck, I guess.

01:42:22.397 --> 01:42:24.106
Yeah.

01:42:24.191 --> 01:42:26.483
It floats around.

01:42:26.568 --> 01:42:29.028
It's got to land on somebody.

01:42:29.112 --> 01:42:31.363
It was my turn, that's all.

01:42:32.449 --> 01:42:34.909
I was in the path of the tornado.

01:42:41.499 --> 01:42:45.252
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:51.258
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:54.178
Me?

01:42:56.473 --> 01:42:57.932
Yeah.

01:42:58.975 --> 01:43:00.935
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

01:43:01.019 --> 01:43:04.521
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

01:43:04.941 --> 01:43:07.025
I tell you where I'd go.

01:43:08.236 --> 01:43:09.862
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:09.946 --> 01:43:11.864
Zi...what?

01:43:11.948 --> 01:43:13.991
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:14.075 --> 01:43:16.160
It's in Mexico.

01:43:17.954 --> 01:43:20.164
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

01:43:21.416 --> 01:43:23.792
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

01:43:23.877 --> 01:43:25.335
No.

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:27.504
They say it has no memory.

01:43:29.966 --> 01:43:32.509
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

01:43:34.095 --> 01:43:36.180
A warm place with no memory.

01:43:39.476 --> 01:43:41.769
Open up a little hotel,

01:43:43.605 --> 01:43:45.481
right on the beach.

01:43:45.565 --> 01:43:47.608
Buy some worthless old boat,

01:43:47.692 --> 01:43:49.777
fix it up new.

01:43:52.739 --> 01:43:53.947
Take my guests out.

01:43:54.032 --> 01:43:56.116
Charter fishing.

01:44:00.038 --> 01:44:02.664
Zihuatanejo, huh?

01:44:05.293 --> 01:44:09.171
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

01:44:15.595 --> 01:44:18.305
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

01:44:25.063 --> 01:44:27.147
I've been in here most of my life.

01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:30.442
I'm an institutional man now.

01:44:30.527 --> 01:44:32.611
Just like Brooks was.

01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:36.281
Well, you underestimate yourself.

01:44:36.366 --> 01:44:38.450
I don't think so.

01:44:41.079 --> 01:44:45.290
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

01:44:45.375 --> 01:44:49.294
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

01:44:49.379 --> 01:44:51.797
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

01:44:53.883 --> 01:44:56.218
The Pacific Ocean?

01:44:56.302 --> 01:44:58.345
Shit.

01:44:58.429 --> 01:45:01.598
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

01:45:01.683 --> 01:45:05.143
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

01:45:07.063 --> 01:45:10.691
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

01:45:10.775 --> 01:45:12.943
That hotel, that boat.

01:45:14.529 --> 01:45:16.697
I don't think that's too much to ask.

01:45:21.327 --> 01:45:24.204
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

01:45:24.289 --> 01:45:26.331
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

01:45:26.416 --> 01:45:29.376
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.503
And that's the way it is.

01:45:31.588 --> 01:45:34.214
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

01:45:35.967 --> 01:45:38.051
It's down there and I'm in here.

01:45:40.763 --> 01:45:43.557
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

01:45:46.394 --> 01:45:48.437
Get busy living

01:45:48.521 --> 01:45:51.440
or get busy dying.

01:45:55.236 --> 01:45:57.321
Andy.

01:45:59.782 --> 01:46:01.867
Red.

01:46:02.911 --> 01:46:05.329
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

01:46:05.413 --> 01:46:07.247
Sure, Andy.

01:46:07.332 --> 01:46:08.665
Anything.

01:46:09.751 --> 01:46:13.211
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

01:46:15.214 --> 01:46:19.009
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:21.136
It's got a long rock wall

01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:23.138
with a big oak tree at the north end.

01:46:23.222 --> 01:46:25.933
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:30.020
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:35.025
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

01:46:36.527 --> 01:46:38.612
I asked and she said yes.

01:46:42.742 --> 01:46:44.785
Promise me, Red,

01:46:44.869 --> 01:46:46.870
if you ever get out,

01:46:46.955 --> 01:46:48.997
find that spot.

01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:55.504
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

01:46:55.588 --> 01:46:58.090
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:04.054
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

01:47:04.138 --> 01:47:06.139
What, Andy?

01:47:06.224 --> 01:47:08.308
What's buried under there?

01:47:10.103 --> 01:47:13.480
You'll have to pry it up to see.

01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.904
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

01:47:21.948 --> 01:47:24.032
He's talking funnier.

01:47:24.117 --> 01:47:27.494
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

01:47:27.578 --> 01:47:31.623
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:34.167
Oh, Lord.

01:47:34.252 --> 01:47:36.294
What?

01:47:37.964 --> 01:47:40.298
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

01:47:40.383 --> 01:47:43.885
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:45.804
Six feet long.

01:47:45.888 --> 01:47:47.347
And you gave it to him?

01:47:47.432 --> 01:47:50.100
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

01:47:50.101 --> 01:47:51.810
Jesus, Heywood.

01:47:51.894 --> 01:47:54.146
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

01:47:54.230 --> 01:47:56.148
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

01:47:56.232 --> 01:47:57.274
No.

01:47:58.317 --> 01:48:00.527
Andy would never do that.

01:48:00.528 --> 01:48:02.612
Never.

01:48:03.656 --> 01:48:05.741
I don't know.

01:48:07.785 --> 01:48:09.870
Every man has his breaking point.

01:48:12.498 --> 01:48:13.749
Lickety-split.

01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:16.710
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:34.895
Three deposits tonight.

01:48:43.279 --> 01:48:45.363
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:48:45.364 --> 01:48:48.825
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:50.285
Yes, sir.

01:48:55.583 --> 01:48:57.250
It's good having you back, Andy.

01:48:57.335 --> 01:49:00.087

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:17.742
Don't say that to me, Haig.

01:52:17.827 --> 01:52:20.078
Don't say that to me again.

01:52:20.162 --> 01:52:21.246

You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

Dufresne.

01:52:42.852 --> 01:52:44.519
He was in his cell at lights out.

01:52:44.603 --> 01:52:47.814
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

01:52:48.899 --> 01:52:50.775
I want him found.

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:53.445

01:52:53.529 --> 01:52:54.571

Well, what?

01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:14.090
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

01:53:15.134 --> 01:53:16.760
He must have said something.

01:53:16.844 --> 01:53:18.887
No, sir, Warden.

01:53:18.971 --> 01:53:20.430
Not a word.

01:53:22.433 --> 01:53:24.434

02:10:38.968 --> 02:10:41.053
<i>A terrible thing to live in fear.</i>

02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:45.808
<i>Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.</i>

02:10:47.977 --> 02:10:50.771
<i>All I want is to be back
where things make sense,</i>

02:10:51.815 --> 02:10:54.316
<i>where I won't have to be afraid all the time.</i>

02:10:57.195 --> 02:10:59.279
<i>Only one thing stops me.</i>

02:11:00.323 --> 02:11:02.408
<i>A promise I made to Andy.</i>

02:11:23.138 --> 02:11:25.222
Here it is.

02:11:35.024 --> 02:11:37.109
Much obliged, sir.

02:15:00.355 --> 02:15:02.439

02:15:15.912 --> 02:15:17.204
<i>ANDY : Dear Red,</i>

02:15:17.288 --> 02:15:19.748
<i>if you're reading this, you've gotten out.</i>

02:15:19.832 --> 02:15:24.086
<i>And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.</i>

02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:26.755
<i>You remember the name of the town, don't you?</i>

02:15:29.050 --> 02:15:31.134
Zihuatanejo.

02:15:32.178 --> 02:15:33.387
<i>I could use a good man</i>

02:15:33.471 --> 02:15:35.514
<i>to help me get my project on wheels.</i>

02:15:35.598 --> 02:15:37.724
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you</i>

02:15:37.809 --> 02:15:39.851
<i>and the chessboard ready.</i>

02:15:40.895 --> 02:15:42.270
<i>Remember, Red,</i>

02:15:42.355 --> 02:15:44.398
<i>hope is a good thing.</i>

02:15:44.482 --> 02:15:46.525
<i>Maybe the best of things.</i>

02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:48.694
<i>And no good thing ever dies.</i>

02:15:49.737 --> 02:15:52.197
<i>I will be hoping that this letter finds you</i>

02:15:52.281 --> 02:15:54.324
<i>and finds you well.</i>

02:15:54.409 --> 02:15:56.910
<i>Your friend, Andy.</i>

02:16:30.487 --> 02:16:34.365
<i><font color="#808080">RED :</font> Get busy living or get busy dying.</i>

02:16:36.869 --> 02:16:38.952
<i>That's goddamn right.</i>

02:16:44.459 --> 02:16:46.585
<i>For the second time in my life,</i>

02:16:46.670 --> 02:16:48.754
<i>I'm guilty of committing a crime.</i>

02:16:50.424 --> 02:16:52.508
<i>Parole violation.</i>

02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:56.219
<i>Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.</i>

02:16:57.473 --> 02:16:59.514
<i>Not for an old crook like me.</i>

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:01.683
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

02:17:05.397 --> 02:17:09.525
<i>I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.</i>

02:17:10.568 --> 02:17:13.571
<i>I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.</i>

02:17:13.655 --> 02:17:16.365
<i>A free man at the start of a long journey</i>

02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:19.368
<i>whose conclusion is uncertain.</i>

02:17:22.246 --> 02:17:24.415
<i>I hope I can make it across the border.</i>

02:17:26.293 --> 02:17:29.085
<i>I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.</i>

02:17:31.465 --> 02:17:34.674
<i>I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.</i>

02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:39.305
<i>I hope.</i>
