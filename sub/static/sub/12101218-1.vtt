You don't understand.

23:18.041 --> 23:21.916
Tonight, I was going to begin treatments
I've been working on my whole life.

23:22.791 --> 23:25.500
I developed a genetic sequencing platform

23:25.583 --> 23:29.875

in unimaginable ways.

the work my parents started.

a way to stop the Miscreants.

They were supposed to be
super strength and invisibility,

her treatment for strength.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.583
I didn't… I didn't mean to…

23:57.666 --> 24:00.875
Maybe you can just,
like, cook up another batch.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.500
It took five years to create that formula,

24:03.583 --> 24:04.666
and more importantly,

24:04.750 --> 24:08.125
your body's undergoing
a molecular change from the injections.

has been increased by 1,000%.

have already healed themselves.

24:43.166 --> 24:46.208
Emily, the only logical thing
to do is stay the course.

24:46.291 --> 24:50.708
We'll continue with the super strength
treatments with the village idiot here

24:50.791 --> 24:53.291
and you begin the treatments
for invisibility.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.666
"Village idiot?"

24:54.750 --> 24:59.583
Hello, Chicago is a city, not a village,
and the best city in the world.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.916
-The Bears, the Cubs--
-Not the time, Lydia.

25:02.833 --> 25:05.791
-There is no other way, is there?
-No, Emily. You know that.

25:06.375 --> 25:10.583
-Em, let's show you to your room.
-Wait a minute, I'm not staying here.

25:10.666 --> 25:14.541
I've got stuff to do. I got work
on Monday. I've got good Bulls tickets.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.208
If you stop the treatments,

25:16.291 --> 25:20.333
it's entirely possible that your body
will violently explode over the weekend.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.250
I can take a peek at a room, you know.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.708
[sighs]

25:32.916 --> 25:33.750
[Lydia] Whoa.

25:34.791 --> 25:37.500
This looks like the jail cell
on Battlestar Galactica.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.375
-Alright, come on, come on, come on.
-Alright.

25:40.458 --> 25:41.291
[door closes]

25:41.875 --> 25:45.916
The room is furnished in a non-distracting
manner to help with your recovery.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.541
Somebody tell me who Urkel is.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.083
-What's an Urkel?
-Not "what's," "who's" an Urkel.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.916
It's Urkel's… Urkel.
Tell her who Urkel is.

25:54.791 --> 25:56.166
How do you not-- Oh my god.

25:56.250 --> 26:00.916
You got glasses and suspenders,
you know, and you seem super smart.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.416
-Let me search.
-You know who Urkel is.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.000
-How do you spell that?
-You spell it Ur-kel.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.166
-Ur…
-Are you kidding?

26:07.250 --> 26:08.791
[imitating Urkel] "Did I do that?"

26:09.541 --> 26:12.333
Right? Does that ring a-- "Did I do that?"

26:12.416 --> 26:15.291
"Did I do that?" You know that.

26:15.916 --> 26:18.041
"Did I… did I do that?"

26:18.125 --> 26:20.750
Mom, is she having
a reaction to the injection?

26:20.833 --> 26:22.708
No, she's always like this.

26:23.666 --> 26:24.625
Did you say "Mom"?

26:25.958 --> 26:27.583
"Mom"? You have a ki-- You…

26:28.208 --> 26:30.458
You have a kid and I didn't even know it?

26:30.541 --> 26:33.208
-You have a secret kid for 20 years?
-I'm only 15.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.333
Well, I don't know that
'cause she never told me!

26:36.416 --> 26:38.833
We don't have time for any of this.

26:38.916 --> 26:41.208
What is Jodie Foster's problem?

26:41.291 --> 26:43.291
Allie helped me set up this whole lab.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.625
She's former CIA. She runs things for me.

26:46.541 --> 26:48.333
Wh-- What? It's a compliment.

26:48.416 --> 26:51.666
I'm saying Jodie Foster, like,
"It puts the lotion in the basket,"

26:51.750 --> 26:53.666
not "Tay in the wind" Jodie Foster.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.791
-Tay in the what?
-Tay in the wind. Ta--

26:55.875 --> 27:00.000
"Tay in the wind! Tay in the wind!" Nell?

27:00.083 --> 27:02.625
-Who's Nell?
-"Who's Nell?" Who's Nell?

27:03.583 --> 27:05.083
Jodie Foster, 1994.

27:05.166 --> 27:09.958
Jodie Foster knows it's Jodie Foster!
How do you not know "Tay in the wind"?

27:10.541 --> 27:16.958
We have clean women's clothing for you.
Everything you could possibly need,

27:17.041 --> 27:21.166
and we will burn what you are wearing
at the first opportunity.

27:21.250 --> 27:23.166
-Nobody's touchin' this.
-Yes, we are.

27:23.666 --> 27:27.291
This is an authentic 1994
Slayer concert T-shirt,

27:27.375 --> 27:29.500
bought in stadium,

27:29.583 --> 27:32.416
and if anybody touches any of this,

27:32.500 --> 27:35.291
I'm sorry, I know you're young,
I'll murder all of you.

27:35.375 --> 27:39.250
Okay. Well, before we get there,
this device is for you.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.000
If you need anything,

27:41.083 --> 27:43.791
-someone will be on call.
-Why aren't you in school?

27:43.875 --> 27:45.958
First, it's the middle of the night,

27:46.041 --> 27:49.375
and second of all,
I graduated from Stanford last year.

27:49.458 --> 27:52.083
Wow, she's a chip off the old nerd block.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.416
She's not a nerd. She's smart.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.083
[both] There's a difference.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.833
And she helps us out a lot around here.

27:58.916 --> 28:00.416
She's great with tech.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.625
-Can I see your wrist for a second?
-Okay.

28:03.708 --> 28:06.833
This is so we can monitor
your vitals as you recover and train.

28:06.916 --> 28:08.750
-Heart rate, blood pressure…
-[beep]

28:08.833 --> 28:11.375
I've had something similar,
but on my ankle--

28:11.458 --> 28:14.125
Lydia, she's 15.
Let's monitor our stories.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.041
Got it.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.625
-You play Fortnite?
-Yes--

28:16.708 --> 28:18.208
-No.
-[Lydia] What's your handle?

28:18.791 --> 28:19.833
T-Wagon-14.

28:19.916 --> 28:23.208
Mine's L-Train-631-Harper-Avenue-
Apartment-7B.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.166
Wait, is that your address?

28:25.250 --> 28:27.541
Oh my god, don't put your address online.

28:27.625 --> 28:30.083
I'm not putting my address online.

28:30.166 --> 28:34.541
I'm at 7A.
7B is my asshole neighbor, Steve.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.083
If somebody's gonna get whacked, it's him.

28:37.666 --> 28:41.333
We should play.
But I gotta warn you. I play dirty!

28:41.416 --> 28:42.416
[laughing]

28:42.500 --> 28:44.833
I am unbelievably bored.

28:44.916 --> 28:48.208
See you in the morning.
We start at 5:00 a.m.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.333
5:00 a.m.? Bullshit.

28:50.416 --> 28:52.791
Uh, I don't start at 5:00 a.m.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.500
[device beeps]
It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

28:56.583 --> 28:58.583
[dramatic music plays]

29:00.375 --> 29:03.083
[Emily] Okay, let's get started.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.000
After a series of treatments,

29:05.083 --> 29:08.500
I'm estimating that we can increase
your ATP by 10,000%.

29:08.583 --> 29:12.083
Everything about you
will become stronger, including your skin,

29:12.166 --> 29:15.916
your vascular and skeletal systems,
making it more difficult to hurt you.

29:16.583 --> 29:21.416
And I'm estimating
that you'll be able to lift 20,000 pounds.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.166
Roughly the weight of a city bus.

29:23.250 --> 29:26.291
Oh my god, I'm gonna
throw the shit out of a city bus.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.375
Language.

29:27.458 --> 29:30.625
I'm gonna throw the pee crap
out of a city bus.

29:30.708 --> 29:33.541
That isn't better
and you're not gonna be throwing a bus.

29:33.625 --> 29:37.041
-That would be very bad.
-[Lydia silently mouthing]

29:37.125 --> 29:38.125
[Emily] Okay.

29:38.208 --> 29:41.333
First, I need you
to lift this mallet and hit the block.

29:41.916 --> 29:44.500
We'll monitor your vitals
and results to get our baseline.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.083
-Why does it look like a carnival thing?
-Because I'm fun.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.000
Okay.

29:49.083 --> 29:49.916
Yeah.

29:53.916 --> 29:55.083
Here goes nothin'.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.500
[Lydia grunts]

29:58.583 --> 30:02.083
I think I sprained my groin.
Do chicks have groins?

30:02.166 --> 30:03.833
-Yes.
-[Lydia] That's what I did.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.291
[groaning]

30:05.375 --> 30:09.583
I might have just peed
just a little bit in my suit too.

30:09.666 --> 30:12.166
According to this,
your bladder did release urine.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.875
[exhales] Great first day, everybody.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

30:15.958 --> 30:18.625
I-- No, no, no.
We are just getting started.

30:18.708 --> 30:21.833
Now that we have a baseline,
it's time to start your treatment.

30:21.916 --> 30:23.916
It's not gonna like yesterday, is it?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.708
[Emily] Not at all.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.083
Each treatment is completely unique.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.291
And it's safe, right?

30:29.375 --> 30:31.458
Oh my god, are they safe?

30:31.541 --> 30:33.333
It's a miracle you're still alive.

30:33.416 --> 30:36.916
There can be
possible complications with any treatment.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.750
Giving you super strength
has inevitable risks.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.958
-Like what?
-Oh…

30:42.041 --> 30:47.708
Like death, amnesia,
paralysis, stroke, brain death,

30:47.791 --> 30:50.750
living inside your mind,
unable to speak or convey thoughts,

30:50.833 --> 30:54.458
which would be the most unspeakable pain,
which we simply abbreviate as--

30:54.541 --> 30:56.166
[all] "The unspeakable."

30:56.250 --> 30:57.875
-And did I say death?
-Yes.

30:58.458 --> 31:01.791
You know, I'm scrambling
to find the silver lining here.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.625
What is it?
At least I don't have diarrhea.

31:04.708 --> 31:06.458
Severe diarrhea is a given.

31:06.541 --> 31:09.875
-That one right there is 100% a certainty.
-Oh my god.

31:09.958 --> 31:13.500
Look, I'll do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

31:14.416 --> 31:17.833
I'm doing this for my parents,
for this city.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.833
[emotional music swells]

31:23.458 --> 31:26.458
Let's get swole
and kick some Miscreant butt.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.125
[groaning in pain]

31:29.583 --> 31:30.416
Son of a…

31:33.375 --> 31:36.833
You said it wasn't gonna be
anything like it was yesterday.

31:36.916 --> 31:39.166
I meant metabolically speaking.

31:39.250 --> 31:42.833
Actually, the delivery method
is exactly the same.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.791
[wailing]

31:44.875 --> 31:47.333
I'm burning! My face is on fire!

31:47.416 --> 31:49.416
That should be over in two seconds.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.958
[continues wailing]

31:52.041 --> 31:53.083
Oh, yeah.

31:53.791 --> 31:56.833
Oh, that was--
I mean, you said it, but it's actually…

31:56.916 --> 31:58.583
It's even cool to the touch.

31:58.666 --> 32:02.458
How about you go pick up that mallet
and hit that thing again?

32:02.541 --> 32:07.958
I don't wanna, because I just got
a bazillion needles injected in my face.

32:08.041 --> 32:11.333
Give it a try, Lydia.
Your results should be instantaneous.

32:12.791 --> 32:16.875
Fine, alright. Hold on to your ta-tas,
'cause this thing's getting crushed.

32:17.458 --> 32:18.291
What are ta-tas?

32:18.375 --> 32:19.625
-Never mind.
-Okay.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.791
-[grunts]
-[thud]

32:24.208 --> 32:26.291
Well, that's a stone-cold bummer.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.000
That's really good
for only your second treatment.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.666
What do you mean?
How many treatments are there?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.500
-Thirty-three.
-Oh my god.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.583
[dramatic music plays]

32:40.416 --> 32:42.708
[device] It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.500
Ah! Ah!

32:51.250 --> 32:54.416
-[device beeps]
-[screaming in pain]

32:55.833 --> 32:56.958
Get outta here.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.333
Why my boobs?

32:59.416 --> 33:00.916
For this course of treatment,

33:01.000 --> 33:04.041
it's important to inject
through the breast tissue

33:04.125 --> 33:05.666
into the pectoral muscle.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.375
-When are we gonna start your treatments?
-Right now, actually.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.458
Here you go, Miss Stanton.

33:13.875 --> 33:16.125
-Thank you, Jessie.
-Wait, it's a pill?

33:16.708 --> 33:19.833
Your whole treatment is…
one stinking pill?

33:19.916 --> 33:22.833
It's a very large pill,
and I had to go off dairy for this.

33:26.708 --> 33:29.083
[device] It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.708
Ahh!

33:32.791 --> 33:35.666
Alright, hold on to your ta-tas, Bill.

33:40.041 --> 33:41.416
Totally meant to do that.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.583
Yeah, I'm good.

33:42.666 --> 33:46.125
It appears that Laser's reign
of destruction will never end,

33:46.208 --> 33:47.666
keeping our city on edge.

33:47.750 --> 33:51.833
The Chicago White Sox and Cubs
have suspended weekend baseball games

33:51.916 --> 33:55.208
due to the increase
in her recent lethal activities.

33:55.291 --> 33:59.083
Meanwhile, mayoral candidate
William "The King" Stevens'

33:59.166 --> 34:01.083
polling numbers have increased…

34:01.166 --> 34:03.541
-There you are, Miss Stanton.
-Thank you.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.000
[Lydia turns off TV] Ugh.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.500
I hear you're not eating.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.458
Nothing tastes right.
I'm not… I'm not hungry.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.666
That's expected.
But you still need to eat.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.958
Due to your body's changing chemistry,

34:16.041 --> 34:18.750
this may be
the only thing you can stomach.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.166
Ew!

34:20.250 --> 34:22.750
Why raw chicken? That's so gross.

34:22.833 --> 34:25.541
Your body needs pure uncooked amino acids

34:25.625 --> 34:28.875
and your skeleton
needs phosphorus for density.

34:37.416 --> 34:39.625
You can really taste the phosphorus.

34:39.708 --> 34:41.666
It's really good.

34:42.583 --> 34:43.958
God, I'm a monster.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.708
No, you're not.

34:45.791 --> 34:47.125
That's juicy.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.875
I have some work to do.

34:49.958 --> 34:51.416
I'm gonna be sick.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.708
-Don't judge me, it's so good.
-Oh my god.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.875
My body needs it.

34:55.958 --> 34:58.250
I'm not an animal!

34:59.250 --> 35:03.208
[Emily] Alright.
This shot put is around 170 pounds.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.125
The average weight of an adult male.

35:05.208 --> 35:08.458
Oh, not the kind of beef I date.
I like 'em thick.

35:08.958 --> 35:11.625
-Here you go.
-I'm just kidding.

35:11.708 --> 35:12.958
Here we go.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.541
[Lydia chuckles]

35:15.625 --> 35:16.666
[crash]

35:16.750 --> 35:17.833
-Oh.
-Ugh.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.625
Do you own that part of the building too?

35:21.708 --> 35:23.875
The sign with my name on it? Yeah.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.916
Could have been Bill Stanton's building.
It's a common name.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.125

your act a little bit. There we go.

58:27.791 --> 58:29.125
She always walk that slow?

58:30.125 --> 58:31.875
That's gotta drive you nuts, right?

58:34.500 --> 58:36.333
Bye. Thanks for coming.

58:36.416 --> 58:38.416
-Don't antagonize them.
-I get nervous.

58:39.166 --> 58:40.541
[Laser] Here, to the right.

58:42.500 --> 58:44.875
-We gotta go check on Grandma.
-Okay. Let's go.

58:47.708 --> 58:49.916
[Grandma] Lydia,
would you say grace, please?

58:50.916 --> 58:51.916
Yeah.

58:54.125 --> 58:58.750
Dear God, bless this food
and the hands that prepared it.

58:58.833 --> 59:02.375
Uh, you know,
thanks for being super cool and stuff.

59:02.458 --> 59:05.541
So, keep kicking butt and, uh, peace out.

59:05.625 --> 59:06.500
Amen.

59:06.583 --> 59:07.625
-Amen.
-Amen.

59:12.833 --> 59:14.250
Uh, Grandma,

59:14.333 --> 59:16.458
have you, um, given any more thought

59:16.541 --> 59:18.750
to letting me get you a place
in a safer neighborhood?

59:19.458 --> 59:20.833
Why would I?

59:20.916 --> 59:25.083
This has been my home for a long time,
and it'll do me until the end.

59:25.166 --> 59:26.875
Please don't talk like that.

59:26.958 --> 59:29.708
I dig it, Grandma.  Morality, right?

59:29.791 --> 59:31.291
It's mortality.

59:31.375 --> 59:32.208
It's what?

59:32.291 --> 59:34.000
-Mortality.
-That's what I said.

59:34.083 --> 59:35.041
You said morality.

59:35.125 --> 59:37.208
-I'm-- What are you saying?
-Mortality.

59:37.291 --> 59:40.000
You're just putting extra Ts in it,
Morta-ta-ta-tality.

59:40.083 --> 59:45.833
I am so happy to see you girls
getting along again. So nice.

59:45.916 --> 59:49.041
-And where is my great-granddaughter?
-She's at work.

59:49.125 --> 59:51.333
She's a hard worker just like her mom.

59:53.166 --> 59:54.625
Can you keep a secret?

59:54.708 --> 59:58.000
-You better not keep secrets from me.
-We shouldn't tell her.

59:58.083 --> 1:00:01.791
Why not? We should probably tell somebody.
She probably knows.

1:00:01.875 --> 1:00:02.916
-Lydia--
-We're--

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.375
Oh, this is amazing.

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:07.333
Oh, please let it be true.

1:00:07.416 --> 1:00:10.416
-I have been praying for this day.
-Praying for what?

1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:12.375
-Really?
-[Grandma] For this moment.

1:00:13.041 --> 1:00:15.541
For you two
to tell me that you're a couple.

1:00:15.625 --> 1:00:18.083
I always knew
you were right for each other.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:20.750
-[Lydia chuckling]
-[Grandma cooing]

1:00:20.833 --> 1:00:22.791
[Lydia] Yeah, um…

1:00:22.875 --> 1:00:24.083
Wow, that's…

1:00:24.166 --> 1:00:28.625
I have been saving it
for this very moment.

1:00:29.791 --> 1:00:32.125
[Grandma laughing happily]

1:00:32.208 --> 1:00:35.791
-I've got Michelle Obama arms.
-You really do. Your arms look amazing.

1:00:35.875 --> 1:00:36.750
Which one am I?

1:00:37.750 --> 1:00:39.083
Okay, you know…

1:00:39.833 --> 1:00:42.625
Uh, wow, that's a…
that's a lot to unpack.

1:00:43.458 --> 1:00:45.458
[Lydia] You know,
I think we both prefer…

1:00:46.875 --> 1:00:48.500
you know, dudes.

1:00:49.750 --> 1:00:52.875
-You don't have to look so disappointed.
-I can't help it.

1:00:52.958 --> 1:00:54.500
You could at least try.

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:57.666
What? Now? You gotta woo me.

1:00:57.750 --> 1:00:59.125
I thought that was it.

1:00:59.208 --> 1:01:01.458
But if the secret is you're Thunder Force,

1:01:01.541 --> 1:01:04.583
you must think I don't watch the news.
You're a meme now.

1:01:04.666 --> 1:01:05.500
Well…

1:01:06.166 --> 1:01:09.416
uh, Grandma that's kind of why we're here.

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:12.000
You could be in danger.

1:01:12.083 --> 1:01:13.791
At least move into our building.

1:01:14.375 --> 1:01:17.958
-Even if it's just temporarily.
-I'm not going anywhere.

1:01:18.916 --> 1:01:21.916
Those people out there killed my daughter,

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.875
took your parents from you,
ruined this city.

1:01:27.125 --> 1:01:30.416
Now I want you two strong women

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:31.916
to go out there,

1:01:32.583 --> 1:01:35.708
kick butt like the superheroes you are,

1:01:35.791 --> 1:01:38.125
and you don't stop until the job is done.

1:01:38.708 --> 1:01:40.708
-Okay.
-And only on that day

1:01:42.041 --> 1:01:44.958
when the city is free from Miscreants,

1:01:46.125 --> 1:01:47.541
can you two have a wedding.

1:01:47.625 --> 1:01:50.291
-[Grandma laughing happily]
-Boom!

1:01:50.375 --> 1:01:53.791
-Come on, eat. It's getting cold.
-[overlapping chatter, laughter]

1:01:53.875 --> 1:01:55.500
[crowd cheering, clapping]

1:01:55.583 --> 1:01:57.833
Hello, Chicago,
thank you for being here.

1:01:57.916 --> 1:02:00.000
I won't take up too much of your time.

1:02:00.083 --> 1:02:01.750
I just want you to know…

1:02:01.833 --> 1:02:04.250
-No sign of Laser.
-[Tracy] Keep your eyes open.

1:02:05.750 --> 1:02:06.583
Whoo.

1:02:07.208 --> 1:02:09.875
This suit is getting ripe.
I gotta wash it.

1:02:09.958 --> 1:02:12.166
-You can't wash it.
-Are you kidding?

1:02:12.250 --> 1:02:14.000
How am I supposed to keep it fresh?

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:17.875
-I need to work on that.
-Yeah, you do.

1:02:17.958 --> 1:02:18.875
Quickly.

1:02:18.958 --> 1:02:22.625
…for the rights and safety
of every last one of you.

1:02:22.708 --> 1:02:25.500
[cheering]

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:28.583
[all chanting] Rachel!

1:02:28.666 --> 1:02:32.833
Let's give it up for our new super-team
who's out protecting our city every night.

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:33.958
Thunder Force!

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:35.458
[cheering, applause]

1:02:39.583 --> 1:02:41.333
How's it going, Chicago?

1:02:42.583 --> 1:02:48.041
Exciting news, Thunder Force is available
for selfies for the low price of $100.

1:02:48.125 --> 1:02:51.000
"What? That seems so cheap."
"It sure does."

1:02:52.125 --> 1:02:56.666
Um, we do not take selfies,
and if we did, they'd be free.

1:02:58.208 --> 1:02:59.666
And they are free.

1:02:59.750 --> 1:03:03.000
They're free with a $100 donation.

1:03:03.625 --> 1:03:07.333
-[crowd chanting] Thunder Force!
-[Lydia] Stop!

1:03:07.416 --> 1:03:09.916
Stop, stop, you guys, stop!

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.166
We can't take it.
Now how do we roll, Chicago?

1:03:13.250 --> 1:03:15.416
-[crowd] Like thunder!
-How do we roll?

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.041
Like thunder!

1:03:17.125 --> 1:03:20.916
-[Lydia] How do we roll? How do we roll?
-[crowd chanting] Like thunder!

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:24.791
[reporter] One thing
we've been covering, early exit polling.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:27.666
We are watching
the minute-by-minute examples

1:03:27.750 --> 1:03:30.458
that are coming into us
here at the station.

1:03:30.541 --> 1:03:32.916
Leading up to the breaking news,
we will have…

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.208
Maybe we should just turn that off.

1:03:35.291 --> 1:03:36.291
[Kenny] I think so.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.833
Hey, chief, you got concealer on?
Is that what that is?

1:03:39.916 --> 1:03:43.208
Well, yeah. I moisturized it
and tried to touch it up a bit.

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:44.666
-Is it helping?
-Not really.

1:03:44.750 --> 1:03:47.416
Go make a snack.
He doesn't need to look at this.

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:50.000
-I'm not hungry.
-Preferably something with aloe.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:52.250
-Okay.
-Find an aloe plant and chew on that.

1:03:52.333 --> 1:03:53.333
-[clears throat]
-Hi!

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:54.708
[The Crab] Ah!

1:03:55.541 --> 1:03:56.500
Never not funny.

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:57.916
[chuckles]

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.166
So, how am I doing?

1:03:59.875 --> 1:04:00.791
With the, uh…

1:04:00.875 --> 1:04:03.875
I don't know. I'm not watching.
You shouldn't watch either.

1:04:03.958 --> 1:04:06.541
Maybe just go
make a pot of that and enjoy.

1:04:06.625 --> 1:04:09.458
[reporter 2]
…protecting our city, Thunder Force!

1:04:09.541 --> 1:04:10.583
[cheering]

1:04:10.666 --> 1:04:13.375
Thunder Force's
recent endorsement of Rachel Gonzales

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:15.333
gave her a bump at the polls.

1:04:15.750 --> 1:04:17.125
-Andrew.
-Yeah.

1:04:17.208 --> 1:04:19.583
-Does this side look the same as this?
-No.

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:22.250
Can you tell which?
One side has a small scab.

1:04:22.333 --> 1:04:24.833
-No, a large scab.
-Shit.

1:04:24.916 --> 1:04:28.541
[reporter 2] We have breaking news.
We are ready to call the election.

1:04:29.250 --> 1:04:32.583
Rachel Gonzales will be
the next mayor of Chicago.

1:04:32.666 --> 1:04:35.541
-And this is a major--
-The King doesn't lose!

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:42.875
-[reporter 1] …The King's full reaction.
-God damn it, sir.

1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.750
That was Kenny.
Good member of the team.

1:04:45.833 --> 1:04:47.083
He shouldn't have been there.

1:04:47.750 --> 1:04:50.625
Your eyes are doing the weird thing.
Can we get you drops?

1:04:50.708 --> 1:04:52.833
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

1:04:54.208 --> 1:04:56.208
That Thunder Force, they're everywhere.

1:04:57.458 --> 1:04:59.833
Someone needs to kill 'em.
They have to be dead.

1:05:02.166 --> 1:05:04.041
Will you stop doing that, please?

1:05:04.125 --> 1:05:06.416
I'm not some little kid
throwing a tantrum!

1:05:09.708 --> 1:05:11.041
I'm very frustrated.

1:05:12.041 --> 1:05:14.125
And even though I killed that guy before,

1:05:14.625 --> 1:05:16.208
it was kind of an accident, so…

1:05:17.041 --> 1:05:18.083
kill that guy.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:27.958
How do you feel now?

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:31.833
Yeah, better. But not great. But better.

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:34.916
You know, boss, I, uh…
I validate your feelings.

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:38.000
Your feelings are your feelings,
but tactically speaking

1:05:38.083 --> 1:05:41.333
I don't think it's smart
to be killing off our best crew members.

1:05:41.416 --> 1:05:43.541
-Was that Walter she just zapped?
-Yeah.

1:05:43.625 --> 1:05:46.833
-Walter was even better than Kenny.
-Crap, I didn't know--

1:05:46.916 --> 1:05:48.041
-I liked Walter.
-Yeah.

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:49.791
What's his name?

1:05:49.875 --> 1:05:52.833
The one left standing?
That's Andy. Andy, can you say hi?

1:05:52.916 --> 1:05:55.708
-It's actually Andrew, but Andy's fine.
-Just the hi.

1:05:55.791 --> 1:05:56.708
Hi.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:00.833
I don't like that guy.

1:06:01.666 --> 1:06:05.666
Next time, kill And--
What do you prefer? Andrew? Andy?

1:06:05.750 --> 1:06:08.791
Either one. At work it's more
professional to go by Andrew.

1:06:08.875 --> 1:06:10.000
My mom calls me Andy.

1:06:10.083 --> 1:06:13.291
Andy-Pandy, but seems
too familiar as I say it out loud.

1:06:13.375 --> 1:06:15.750
Lacrosse had three Andrews.
They called me Drew.

1:06:15.833 --> 1:06:17.708
My coach called me
by my middle name, Andy.

1:06:17.791 --> 1:06:18.625
Alright.

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:21.208
My mom's new boyfriend
loves Andrew Lloyd Webber.

1:06:21.291 --> 1:06:23.458
-So, he just calls me Paul.
-Enough.

1:06:24.541 --> 1:06:25.708
Next time kill Andrew.

1:06:26.375 --> 1:06:28.166
Got it. What's our next move?

1:06:29.041 --> 1:06:30.333
Well, as I like to say,

1:06:31.125 --> 1:06:33.166
when life gives you lemons, make…

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:34.750
[both] …lemon-flavored napalm.

1:06:34.833 --> 1:06:36.166
It's the greatest saying.

1:06:36.250 --> 1:06:37.916
-Call a news conference.
-Will do.

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:42.791
-Clean that up, Andy-rew.
-Yeah.

1:06:42.875 --> 1:06:44.500
-Yeah.
-Whatever.

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:47.000
[The King] I believe in democracy.

1:06:48.208 --> 1:06:52.250
I lost to the better candidate tonight
and as a gesture of goodwill,

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:56.291
I'm gonna host a celebration
for mayor-elect Gonzales

1:06:56.375 --> 1:06:58.166
and the great city of Chicago.

1:06:58.916 --> 1:07:01.708
Because this city
deserves what's coming to it.

1:07:02.458 --> 1:07:03.500
A party!

1:07:05.750 --> 1:07:06.583
Thank you.

1:07:06.666 --> 1:07:08.500
[reporters murmuring]

1:07:09.916 --> 1:07:11.458
[Frank] Pancakes on the house.

1:07:11.541 --> 1:07:14.208
Look.
Business has picked up thanks to you two.

1:07:14.958 --> 1:07:16.750
So, thank you, Lydia, Emily.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.166
Welcome.

1:07:18.250 --> 1:07:20.083
-Those suits are great.
-Right?

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:21.166
Wish I had one.

1:07:21.250 --> 1:07:23.041
-Alright. Enjoy.
-Thanks.

1:07:23.125 --> 1:07:26.250
Yeah. How about a toast
to the good guys winning the election?

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.125
Let's not celebrate too fast.

1:07:29.208 --> 1:07:32.166
The King's not throwing a party
out of the goodness of his heart.

1:07:32.250 --> 1:07:33.083
Yeah.

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:36.916
Excuse me. I'm gonna wash my hands up.

1:07:38.708 --> 1:07:41.083
Not washing her hands.
She's going to the can.

1:07:41.166 --> 1:07:43.750
God knows what she's doing.
I don't wanna know.

1:07:43.833 --> 1:07:47.291
Sometimes I can't picture
certain people doing certain things.

1:07:47.375 --> 1:07:49.291
Know what I mean? Like Obama vacuuming

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:51.375
or Eleanor Roosevelt flossing--

1:07:51.458 --> 1:07:52.875
[explosion]

1:07:55.333 --> 1:07:58.458
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[muffled groaning]

1:07:58.541 --> 1:08:00.708
[muffled clamoring]

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:07.750
-Em, are you okay?
-What happened?

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:27.333
Frank, stay down.

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:29.916
Stay down.

1:08:32.208 --> 1:08:34.791
I thought The King wanted
to talk things through.

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:37.583
I've been let off the leash.

1:08:37.666 --> 1:08:39.541
You need to work on your phrasing,

1:08:39.625 --> 1:08:42.541
because in that scenario,
you just made yourself the dog.

1:08:43.875 --> 1:08:47.000
I'm surprised you ding-dongs
lived through the first blast.

1:08:47.083 --> 1:08:50.791
-You're stronger than I thought.
-Maybe you're weaker than you thought.

I'm…

1:08:56.208 --> 1:08:57.083

1:08:59.083 --> 1:09:01.208

1:09:02.166 --> 1:09:03.666
Did she call us ding-dongs?

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:05.708
Get a shovel.
I'm gonna bury that bitch.

I could hit harder,
but I don't wanna kill you,

Thunder Force needs this.

1:10:19.041 --> 1:10:22.416
Lydia, no. Do not throw that bus.

-Lydia!
-I got it!

No, they're too far away! Do not!

I can't hear you
because I'm literally throwing a bus!

Dads, that lady just threw a bus.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.375
My god, I just threw a bus.

Of course, you did.
You don't think before you act.

You always do the stupid thing.

You could've hurt someone.

You know how dangerous that was?

1:10:55.583 --> 1:10:58.541
I'm sorry. I messed up.
I was trying to stop her.

1:10:58.625 --> 1:11:00.625
Dang it. You always get carried away.

Ever since we were kids.

You understand this isn't a game?
We have a job to do.

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:08.250
I have dedicated my life
to stopping Miscreants

1:11:08.333 --> 1:11:10.083
and here you are acting like one.

1:11:11.416 --> 1:11:14.625
I didn't see you trying anything
to stop her except disappearing,

1:11:14.708 --> 1:11:18.166
which, by the way, you've been doing
since before you got your power.

1:11:18.250 --> 1:11:22.000
You know what? I should have both powers
because I'd know how to use them.

some stuff with Lydia.

so much of our time together.

to stop the bad guys, right?

that you might be dead.

put her back into trying to kill us.

-The suits are very resilient.

I mean, they do not smell good.

1:14:23.166 --> 1:14:26.208
Wow, they don't smell good.
But very resilient.

1:14:26.291 --> 1:14:27.541
You smell good to me.

1:14:27.625 --> 1:14:29.625
Yeah. Which, you know, is surprising,

1:14:29.708 --> 1:14:32.125
'cause I don't have
a sense of smell that good,

1:14:32.208 --> 1:14:35.625
ever since the, you know--
Since the accident.

1:14:35.708 --> 1:14:39.750
If it's not too… too much,
too soon, what happened?

1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:46.250
Oh, well, I was
on my honeymoon in Bermuda,

1:14:46.333 --> 1:14:47.875
and my then-wife,

1:14:47.958 --> 1:14:51.583
she says, "Jer, how about
we go skinny-dip snorkeling?"

1:14:51.666 --> 1:14:54.916
And, uh, I say,
"That sounds fun. Let's go buns up."

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.625
We took off our clothes,
jumped in the water,

1:14:57.708 --> 1:15:01.333
and what we didn't know is
we were over a radioactive coral reef.

1:15:01.416 --> 1:15:02.500
Is that right?

1:15:02.583 --> 1:15:06.000
And up jumps a radioactive crab,
bites me in the genitals.

1:15:06.583 --> 1:15:07.541
Oh, man.

1:15:08.041 --> 1:15:09.000

-She immediately left me.
-Her loss.

1:15:11.166 --> 1:15:13.583
Anyway, I went into a life of crime.

1:15:14.083 --> 1:15:16.583
I don't know,
it brings up some kinda questions.

1:15:16.666 --> 1:15:21.583
You tell me that story. Are you--
I mean, are you fully a Miscreant or…

1:15:21.666 --> 1:15:22.916
Not crazy about labels.

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.041
-But I do get that a lot.
-Yeah.

1:15:25.125 --> 1:15:27.916
What I usually-- I say I'm a Half-creant.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.583
-Half-Korean.
-Half-creant.

1:15:30.166 --> 1:15:31.583
I thought you said half-Korean.

1:15:31.666 --> 1:15:34.416
You're not the first one to--
Yeah, but no.

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:38.916
Either one would be wildly interesting,
but Half-creant… I like that.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.333
Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:40.416 --> 1:15:44.583
I thought we had a real nice connection
there at the liquor store.

1:15:45.625 --> 1:15:47.625
You know, I don't know if it's…

1:15:47.708 --> 1:15:50.666
because I got a lot of family
up and down the East Coast or…

1:15:50.750 --> 1:15:51.666
Oh, yeah?

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:55.500
Maybe it's the smell
of Old Bay has always kind of…

1:15:56.416 --> 1:15:58.166
just done something to me.

1:15:58.250 --> 1:15:59.833
Kind of made me warm and fuzzy.

1:16:00.416 --> 1:16:01.708
It's a great smell.

inside those kind of yoked, strong…

-No, I'm not a child.

to drink it like it's cocoa.

-Well--
-If you're looking for suggestions,

personally, is the petite seafood tower.

-Jesus.
-Recommending that to me, huh? [laughs]

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:24.166
-That takes a lot of stones.
-What is this, the cannibal table?

1:17:24.250 --> 1:17:27.333
You gonna offer me
a 32-year-old woman named Lydia?

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.458
Because I'm 32.

1:17:29.541 --> 1:17:32.916
I believe it and I won't offer you that.
I'll be sensible next time.

I apologize for raising my voice,

1:17:39.541 --> 1:17:43.000
but I got bit on the ball bag
by a radioactive crab,

1:17:43.083 --> 1:17:44.541
and I used to love shellfish.

1:17:44.625 --> 1:17:48.291
So, my fuse is a little short.
This is a trigger environment for me.

1:17:48.375 --> 1:17:49.416
-I understand.
-Okay.

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:52.083
I'm gonna need a minute.
Why don't you take off?

1:17:52.166 --> 1:17:53.000
No problem.

-They're just jealous.
-'Cause of who I'm sitting with maybe.

Anything on that menu look good?

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:01.291
I was thinking about chicken,

1:18:01.375 --> 1:18:03.958
but I was afraid
you might be half-chicken.

1:18:04.041 --> 1:18:08.208
Ha. No, no. Just crab and man.

1:18:08.291 --> 1:18:11.166
A lot of man.
I was gonna order the chicken too,

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:14.916
but unfortunately, I like my chicken
the way you get it in the crab traps,

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:16.500
-and that's raw.
