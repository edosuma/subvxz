00:27.840 --> 00:29.480
<i>Their actions sparked</i>
<i>a heated debate</i>

00:29.560 --> 00:32.360
<i>about whether or not</i>
<i>a person can be born evil.</i>

00:33.240 --> 00:34.880
<i>In the spring of 2013,</i>

00:34.960 --> 00:39.040
<i>this quiet Malmö suburb woke up</i>
<i>to the news of an unimaginable event.</i>

00:40.280 --> 00:42.320
<i>When the caretaker</i>
<i>of the local swimming pool</i>

00:42.400 --> 00:43.800
<i>came to work that morning,</i>

00:43.880 --> 00:47.480
<i>he found Jorgen Moberg's battered body</i>
<i>locked in a burning hot sauna.</i>

00:49.760 --> 00:53.320
<i>The autopsy later revealed</i>
<i>that he had died from overheating.</i>

00:55.280 --> 00:58.680
<i>During the trial that followed,</i>
<i>the case continued to make headlines,</i>

00:58.760 --> 01:02.640
<i>as hundreds of protesters gathered</i>
<i>outside the District Court of Malmö,</i>

01:03.560 --> 01:06.760
<i>where Elias Fager,</i>
<i>too young to be put on trial,</i>

01:06.840 --> 01:09.160
<i>confessed to taking part in the killing</i>

01:09.240 --> 01:11.960
<i>and gave evidence</i>
<i>against his older brother, Soren.</i>

01:27.320 --> 01:30.040
If that's the best we've got,
let's go with it. Thank you.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.040


01:54.000 --> 01:54.920
Please.

01:55.000 --> 01:55.920
Thank you.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.000
How are we doing this?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.200
We're professionals.
That's what we let people see.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.240
-All the rest, we leave at the front door.
-Okay, great.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.320
-You're not gonna ask me what I want?
-I know what you want.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.880
What's that?

02:17.760 --> 02:18.680
My job.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.840
Is that what you think, really?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.560
I, uh… I want the Fager case.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.240
-Frida--
-Detective Inspector Rask.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.560
Detective Inspector Rask.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.520
Are you sure that's a good idea?

02:39.040 --> 02:41.160
I'm the most experienced here.
You know that.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.240
I do. That's why the answer is no.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.280
You're my lead detective. I need you
across the unit while I find my feet.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.920
With all due respect,
that's not my problem.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.120
Fine.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.040
A compromise.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.360
Lead the investigation,
but let Wallander do the donkey work.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.880
This might not be anything
other than a tragic accident,

03:04.960 --> 03:08.400
but if Elias Fager was murdered,
maybe someone knew who he was.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.120
We could be dealing with a vigilante.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.560
If that's the case,
then Elias's brother might be in danger.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.720
We need to speak to Soren.
Can we bring him in?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.640
I'm almost certain
he was the guy in the flat.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.320
So you're guessing.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.840
-Soren got out of jail four days ago--
-You went in there without a warrant.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.040
I just wanted
to confirm the victim's identity.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.800
It was on my orders, sir.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.480
On your orders? Really?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.760
We need to talk to Soren.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.080
There's no way the Ministry of Justice
will release his new identity

03:35.160 --> 03:38.120
or whereabouts unless a specific threat
is made against his life

03:38.200 --> 03:39.640
or he's suspected of a serious crime.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.560
And we're gonna need a lot more
than a hunch to convince them of that.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.200
Yes, sir.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.560
Get on with it.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.760
All right, listen.
Just give them a nudge, will you?

03:58.840 --> 04:01.400
We've been waiting for this call
since four. Thanks, fam.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.320
No, I haven't got hold
of the waitress yet,

04:06.400 --> 04:08.360
and yes, I'm still working on it.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.400
It was Soren in Elias's flat.
I know it. He was looking for his brother.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.480
-And he didn't know he was dead.
-Why was Elias walking down that alleyway?

04:21.560 --> 04:25.280
He was walking away from everything.
The taxi ranks, the tram stop, the club.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.360
Maybe he did need to take a piss.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
In that tunnel? Ugh.
No, I'd never do that.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.440
That puts you in 1% of the entire male
population, Wallander. Congratulations.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.720
The sedan?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.920
That alley's barely wide enough for a car.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.600
We know how fast the car was going
when it hit him.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.160
Why would anyone wanna speed down there?

04:46.240 --> 04:49.480
Look, you and I both know
that this wasn't an accident,

04:49.560 --> 04:51.160
but Osei's right.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.560
Problem is right now, we can't prove it.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.440
Go find that witness again
and see if she can give us anything.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.360
-<i>When is her next shift then?</i>
-I don't know.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.560
Look, I don't care
if you pay your staff off the books.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.320
Does she have a friend here?
Someone I can reach her through?

05:11.400 --> 05:12.480
Uh…

05:12.560 --> 05:14.440
You could try the university.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.360
Make sure she gets this.
Tell her to call me.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.600
Tell her she isn't in any trouble,
but it's important, okay?

05:30.920 --> 05:33.800
Hey, sorry to bother you.
Uh, I'm looking for…

05:36.400 --> 05:37.920
-No.
-No idea?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.400
-No.
-Okay. Okay.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.560
-I don't know her, sorry.
-Okay.

06:04.040 --> 06:04.920
Hey.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.760
Yep. She lives in student digs,
16 History Lane, second floor.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.800
Oh, thank you.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.760
Katja, this is Kurt Wallander,
the detective.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.680
Listen, I need to talk to you.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.120
KURT WALLANDER
CRIMINAL INSPECTOR

06:41.840 --> 06:44.760
Well, yeah, Friday or Monday's fine.
See you later.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.040
Hey, hey, Kurt. I sense a bright idea.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.760
Yeah, so, after the hit-and-run,

06:50.840 --> 06:53.440
the car took a route
where it wasn't caught on CCTV, right?

06:53.520 --> 06:56.280
Yep. There was a camera in the tunnel,
but it was broken.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.600
-So I went through the logs. May I?
-Yeah.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.640
Thanks.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.080
What's this?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.720
This is a call-out
on a domestic-violence case.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.200
The timeline fits
and just a couple of blocks away.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.440
It must've passed the dark sedan
further back before the turn here,

07:15.520 --> 07:18.880
and it might have picked our guy up
on the patrol car's dashcam.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.640
I mean, it's a long shot.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.560
Yeah, but worth checking up on.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.720
Wake up!

07:41.880 --> 07:43.760
I'm awake. I was working.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.200
Of course you were. Listen, I spoke to Jaz
and, uh, we'd love to come over tonight.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.440
-Great.
-Yeah, we got a babysitter and everything.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.920
Yeah, that's wonderful.
I'll-- I'll cook for you.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.080
Don't worry about it, man.
Just get a takeaway.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.040
Are you okay?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.120
Yeah, man. Just a headache.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.880
-It's gonna be good tonight, bro.
-Yeah.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.480
-Yeah.
-Osei wants a word.

08:07.960 --> 08:08.840
Oh yeah?

08:09.360 --> 08:10.320
All right.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.080
Good luck, man.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.480
He wanted me
to be part of the big revolution,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.400
overthrow the government.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.960
My dad hates authority,
especially the police.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.840
So honestly, it was a way for me
to annoy the hell out of him.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.240
I understand you've been very critical

08:31.320 --> 08:33.560
of the investigation
into the bombing at North Harbor.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.440
I don't want to get into politics.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.560
Politics?

08:37.680 --> 08:39.680
You consider police work politics?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.320
Is that a trick question?

08:41.920 --> 08:43.440
I just wanna know.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.440
I think it can be if you let it.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.720
Less than a month ago, you brought in
Karl-Axel Munck for an interrogation

08:51.800 --> 08:54.920
that ended up with you threatening him
outside the station here.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.280
I have apologized
to Munck's legal team on our behalf

08:59.360 --> 09:00.960
because we're part of a team.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.160
And from now on, that's how you'll behave.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.320
No personal vendettas, no threats.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.400
If you wish to continue working here,

09:08.480 --> 09:11.280
you will represent this unit
in accordance with protocol.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.080
Keep those emotions in check.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.840
You've been given an opportunity
to impress me.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.240
It'd be in your very best interest
to do so.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.520
You all right?

09:30.760 --> 09:31.920
He wants me gone.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
Early lunch.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.600
Come on.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.120
Lamb shish kebab, right?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.600
The only way to eat meat.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.160
Is that your best Hemberg?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.040
Turkish street food

09:50.640 --> 09:52.560
and an expensive bottle of Barolo.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.880
Come on. It's gonna be fine.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.360
We just-- We just need to get used to him.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.200
Do I have a problem
keeping my emotions in check?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.920
What the fuck did you do now?

10:06.080 --> 10:08.520
He said I can't keep my emotions in check.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.000
He's got a point, Kurt.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.520
Listen, I've asked for everything there is
on the Fager brothers.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.280
With it all being classified,
it could take a while.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.520
How could they have overpowered him?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.840
Fourteen and 16?

10:29.480 --> 10:32.480
Soren was big, pumped up on drugs.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.080
They caught him off guard.
He was locking up the pool.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.520
-What was their motive?
-Revenge.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.160
Moberg had accused Soren
of bullying his daughter,

10:43.240 --> 10:45.560
took his head off
in front of the entire class.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.160
Killing him seems a bit extreme,
doesn't it?

10:49.240 --> 10:50.160
Yeah.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.640
But they were damaged kids, right?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.240
Aren't we all?

10:57.360 --> 10:58.800
<i>Their father died first,</i>

10:58.880 --> 11:02.360
<i>and the mother overdosed</i>
<i>when Elias was only about three years old.</i>

11:02.880 --> 11:05.000
<i>She struggled</i>
<i>with severe mental-health issues.</i>

11:05.080 --> 11:07.080
And-- And what about the foster parents?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.000
<i>Divorced.</i>

11:08.080 --> 11:11.720
<i>He passed away, cancer,</i>
<i>and she remarried and lives in Spain.</i>

11:11.800 --> 11:13.520
Okay. Thank you.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.840
If you think of anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.840
<i>Of course.</i>

11:59.880 --> 12:00.760
Fuck!

12:04.240 --> 12:06.400
<i>Hi, this is Katja. Leave a message.</i>

12:06.480 --> 12:08.840
Hi, Katja. This is Kurt Wallander again.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.720
-Listen, I really need to talk to you.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.280
Please call me back.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.160
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.440
I just warmed him up for you a little bit.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.680
I'm sorry. Family. Please.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.920
No, it's okay. It's fine.
I've got a family myself.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.920
Um, so, Officer Abd Al-Rahman…

12:57.320 --> 13:00.280
tell me why you decided
to become a police officer.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.600
Can I be honest with you, sir?

13:06.760 --> 13:07.800
Absolutely.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.920
I could never answer
that question sincerely because…

13:18.280 --> 13:21.760
I thought the person on the other side
wouldn't understand.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.360
Though the truth is

13:26.720 --> 13:29.800
I feel very grateful
being in this part of the world.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.680
My father never made it out.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.880
And he paid the ultimate price
for fighting for what he believed in.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.880
What I'm trying to say is
I'm really proud of what we have here.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.040
I wanna fight for it,
and I wanna defend it.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.800
And I wanna keep my family safe
along the way.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.400
I appreciate your honesty.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.520
And you are clearly committed.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.960
I read about what happened during
the demonstrations earlier this year.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.360
You should never have been placed
in that position.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.400
I got separated.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.040
There was nobody to blame.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.960
Nevertheless, it must've been
an extremely traumatic experience.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.400
I trust you're fully recovered now.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.960
Yes, sir. Absolutely, 100%.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.040
My understanding is
that around the same time,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.880
you actually gained a position
here at Major Crimes.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.920
That is correct. It's where I wanna be.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.760
But ultimately, the position was filled
by Detective Wallander.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.720
So what happened?

14:36.240 --> 14:39.240
Me and Kurt, we're like brothers.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.440
We're friends.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.520
There's nothing wrong with that.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.920
He's also a very good detective, sir.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.600
Officer Al-Rahman,

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
there are going to be changes around here.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.800
We're building a new team,

14:57.880 --> 15:01.320
and I believe what that team requires
are people like you.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.160
But there'll be no place
for secrets or loose cannons.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
I look forward to working with you.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.320
Is red wine good for you guys?

15:19.400 --> 15:20.240
Perfect.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.720
Just water for me, please.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.320
So you have a new boss. What's he like?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.960
Yeah, I mean, you know what it's like
in the beginning. Everyone's tense.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.600
-Mm.
-Everybody's a bit stressed out,

15:34.120 --> 15:36.560
but, uh, he knows what he's doing.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.560
He comes from
a completely different background,

15:38.640 --> 15:41.080
so I think he's saying the right things.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.360
So how was your chat with him, man?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.040
Good. Good, he's cool. Yeah.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.080
He's no Hemberg, of course,

15:49.920 --> 15:52.400
but, um, there's just-- I don't know, man.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.480
There's just something different
about him.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.320
You know what I mean? Like just fresh.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.680
He could become a speechwriter.
He would make a buck, for sure.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.600
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I'm just kidding.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.720
No, seriously like…

16:07.040 --> 16:08.480
You got a problem with Osei?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.400
I don't know. I--

16:10.480 --> 16:11.800
Well, spit it out, man.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.880
I just think he seems to care
a bit too much about how things look.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.920
And you don't think
what people think about us is important?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.200
I agree with his politics.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.840
I just don't think politics
belongs in the police force.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.640
I think it's important
that we remain objective.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
-That's exactly his point.
-Okay.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.000
We're not objective.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.800
You just don't see that.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.880
Because I'm white?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.800
-Hey.
-No. I want to understand. Tell me.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.680
You don't have to deal with it every day.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.680
Okay.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.560
The rule book for you and me
is completely different.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.040
That's what you don't know.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.000
Know how much harder I have to work to get
half the shit that you take for granted?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.680
-'Cause my life's just been easy?
-'Cause it fucking has been, Kurt!

16:54.240 --> 16:55.360
It fucking has.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.560
Reza, calm down.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.640
I'm sorry, Mona.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.200
I did fucking everything
to get that position.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.720
And they just fucking give it to you.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.320
Like I didn't even exist.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.960
It just fucking hurts
that you're so oblivious sometimes.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.840
It was delicious, Mona.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.160
Oh, good. Good.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.680
Thanks.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.120
What was that all about?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.600
He just doesn't get it sometimes.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.160
Baby, Kurt's family.

17:54.880 --> 17:55.720
I know.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.680
-How's your head?
-It's okay.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.040
-I want you to see someone.
-I don't need this shit right now, Jaz.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.120
Sorry if I got a bit…

18:15.200 --> 18:16.800
Talk to your friend about it.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.080
-You should listen to him.
-Yeah.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.080
Make it stop ringing.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.240
Morning, Rask.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.640
-<i>Have you seen the fucking news?</i>
What?

19:02.720 --> 19:04.040
Have you seen it?

19:04.120 --> 19:07.200
<i>They've got his name, pictures.</i>
<i>They have everything.</i>

19:07.800 --> 19:09.320
<i>According to TT…</i>

19:09.400 --> 19:10.960
<i>How the hell did this get out?</i>

19:11.040 --> 19:13.640
<i>…that the young man</i>
<i>who was killed in the hit-and-run</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:15.760
<i>was Elias Fager, one of two…</i>

19:15.840 --> 19:18.440
<i>We were told specifically</i>
<i>to keep this out of the press.</i>

19:18.520 --> 19:20.280
<i>…Elias and his brother Soren…</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:21.760
<i>Osei is gonna go ballistic.</i>

19:21.840 --> 19:24.520
<i>…were found guilty</i>
<i>of the brutal murder of Jorgen Moberg.</i>

19:24.600 --> 19:25.760
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

19:25.840 --> 19:28.080
<i>…believed to have been an act of revenge.</i>

19:28.160 --> 19:29.000
Shit.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.400
Get over here now.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.400
Rask.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.040
Wallander?

19:34.120 --> 19:35.400
He was here a moment ago.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.640
Find him.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.480
<i>Elias's older brother Soren</i>

19:41.560 --> 19:44.320
<i>was sentenced to eight years</i>
<i>for his part in the killing.</i>

19:44.400 --> 19:47.440
<i>The fact that Elias Fager</i>
<i>was too young at the time</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:49.280
<i>to be jailed for Moberg's murder</i>

19:49.360 --> 19:51.280
<i>provoked public outrage.</i>

19:51.360 --> 19:54.600
<i>Elias and his older brother</i>
<i>were issued protected identities</i>

19:54.680 --> 19:57.640
<i>and have been living</i>
<i>under assumed names ever since.</i>

19:58.880 --> 19:59.960
<i>I'm Katja.</i>

20:00.040 --> 20:00.920
Anton.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.400
Explain to me how the hell this got out.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.640
Internal Affairs will be all over us.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.120
Sir, why would either of us
wanna leak this?

20:19.800 --> 20:23.200
Perhaps because someone
is frustrated, disappointed.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.520
If you've got something to say,
I suggest that you say it.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.840
It's out of my hands.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.840
-What was that all about?
-Nothing.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.480
-Did you tell anyone?
-No.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.240
Did you talk to your girlfriend?

20:52.360 --> 20:54.840
Are you serious? Of course not.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.240
Now the best thing
we can do moving forward

20:59.320 --> 21:01.160
is to have each others' backs, all right?

21:03.080 --> 21:04.280
God, Sara.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.120
Moberg's widow. Someone's gonna
have to explain this fuck-up to her.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.680
It's not gonna be
some random family liaison officer.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.800
Get your coat.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.560
-Milk?
-Uh, no, I'm fine.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.480
<i>…notorious killers.</i>

21:26.560 --> 21:29.200
<i>Eight years ago,</i>
<i>Elias and his brother Soren,</i>

21:29.280 --> 21:30.880
<i>just teenagers at the time,</i>

21:30.960 --> 21:34.120
<i>were found guilty</i>
<i>of the brutal murder of Jorgen Moberg.</i>

21:34.200 --> 21:35.760
I can't go through this again.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.240
Just don't talk to the media.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.360
Hopefully, this will all blow over soon.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.760
We should've been the ones
to have had our identities protected.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.320
Not those monsters that killed my husband.

21:51.120 --> 21:56.360
Just can't bear to think of Alexia
having to relive her dad's death again.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.440
I'm sorry, Sara.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.680
This man

22:02.880 --> 22:06.440
didn't spend a day in prison.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.800
How is that possible?

22:08.600 --> 22:10.400
<i>The death of Elias Fager…</i>

22:10.480 --> 22:12.240
They destroyed my life.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.960
<i>…and once again sparks the debate</i>
<i>of Sweden's judicial system.</i>

22:17.320 --> 22:19.920
They're saying it's a vigilante attack.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.400
The investigation is still ongoing.
We can't--

22:23.480 --> 22:26.840
I want to know
when you find the person who did it.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.280
Yeah?

22:31.080 --> 22:33.160
I wanna thank them personally

22:33.960 --> 22:37.600
for making sure
that justice was finally done.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.160
<i>…protected identities</i>

22:39.240 --> 22:42.240
<i>and have been living</i>
<i>under assumed names ever since.</i>

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
How come you ended up
with the Fager case and not Hemberg?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.320
It was his case.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.880
His wife had just left him.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.440
He was a bit of a mess.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.640
He needed help. I needed to prove myself.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.760
Hmm.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.400
What?

23:04.480 --> 23:07.560
Oh, Kurt, he was such a nightmare.
You've no idea.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.000
-I can imagine.
-No, you can't.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.200
Growing up, it was just me and my dad,

23:14.280 --> 23:17.560
so I suppose I was pretty used
to having to keep things together.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.480
How was he, your dad?

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
Off the rails.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.600
He's not around anymore. Yours?

23:24.800 --> 23:28.440
My dad is his own best company. Yeah.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.440
-Hmm.
-Yeah. Yeah.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.560
Oh God, I miss Hemberg.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.000
Hmm.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.280
Me too.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.240
You know, down here,
they used to have dodos

23:43.320 --> 23:45.680
and huge fucking beavers,
a kilometer from here.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.280
Now they're trying to recreate mammoths
using new technology.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.480
How the fuck are they doing that?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.600
What, penguins shagging elephants?

23:53.680 --> 23:55.520
DNA, you melt.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.880
<i>…was Elias Fager,</i>
<i>one of two notorious killers.</i>

23:58.960 --> 23:59.800
Vince?

23:59.880 --> 24:02.520
<i>The murder of Jorgen Moberg,</i>
<i>a respected schoolteacher,</i>

24:02.600 --> 24:04.840
<i>sent shock waves throughout the country.</i>

24:04.920 --> 24:07.320
<i>The fact that Elias Fager</i>
<i>was too young at the time</i>

24:07.400 --> 24:11.520
<i>to be jailed for Moberg's murder</i>
<i>provoked public outrage.</i>

24:11.600 --> 24:15.040
<i>Elias's older brother, Soren,</i>
<i>was sentenced to eight years</i>

24:15.120 --> 24:16.600
<i>for his part in the killing,</i>

24:17.120 --> 24:20.080
<i>a sentence that many believe</i>
<i>was far too lenient.</i>

24:30.160 --> 24:31.040
Fuck!

25:10.200 --> 25:12.520
-DI Rask.
-Hey, how're you doing?

25:12.600 --> 25:14.360
-Good to see you, as always.
-Yeah, you too.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.120
Wallander, good to see you back.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.200
How's things going
over in Infernal Affairs?

25:19.280 --> 25:20.760
Fine, thanks, Detective.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.320
We need a word about the leak,
if you don't mind.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.160
All right, sure. Okay. Now?

25:28.320 --> 25:29.240
Okay.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.800
Chivalry's not dead.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.360
Grab the blinds, Nielson.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.640
Okay, gents, what do you need?
Quick as you can. I haven't got time.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.320
We've got protocol to stick to.
You understand that.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.360
-We'll be in touch shortly.
-I'm sure you will, Edman.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.200
-Oh God.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.520
-How'd it go?
-It's like pulling teeth.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.680
What're you up to?

26:20.760 --> 26:23.040
-Reliving your misspent youth?

26:24.280 --> 26:26.880
No, I'm trying to find out
if Elias left the club alone

26:26.960 --> 26:30.320
or if someone was waiting for him,
if it was a planned attack.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.200
They could've been outside the club,
might even be a shot of the car.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.160
All right, uh, field it over to Modin.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.400
She can put it through
some facial-recognition bollocks.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.200
You see? This is why you're in charge.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.000
Hey, I need your help
trying to find a face in a haystack.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.720
Just the gorgeous detective
I wanted to see.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.480
-I've got something. Remember the CCTV?
-Yeah.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.120
This is the dashcam
from the passing patrol car.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.840
See?

27:19.520 --> 27:21.360
Yeah, the headlight's broken.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.840
Fits with the timeline.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.400
Bumper's damaged too.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.200
-Whoa, wait, there.
-Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.080
Okay, run it.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.560
Let's see who our killer is.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.560
It's one of ours.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.440
That can't be right.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.480
Erik Andersson. Do you know him?

27:43.600 --> 27:46.120
Yeah, I know him. He works in fraud.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.280
Hey, Erik. Yeah.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.120
It's Frida. Hi.
I don't have a lot of time.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.000
Okay, and there's no spare set of keys
anyone would've had access to?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
Cheers, Erik.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.920
This stays between us, yeah?

27:59.360 --> 28:00.200
So?

28:00.960 --> 28:02.520
Andersson's on holiday in Spain.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.440
Spain?

28:03.520 --> 28:04.880
Oh, nice.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.680
He's been there all week.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.800
Where did he leave his car?

28:28.160 --> 28:29.560
What's this all about?

28:29.640 --> 28:31.960
A green Skoda allocated to Erik Andersson.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.160
It's supposed to be in for service.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.480
Yeah. The service
on Andersson's car was done.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.280
It's ready for collection.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.320
Go double-check
the green Skoda's still in the lot.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.120
You're not gonna find it.
It was used in a hit-and-run.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.840
The one that killed Elias Fager.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.600
Shit. I heard about that.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.240
It's the only set.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.560
I take one bite,
and my whole throat starts swelling up.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.320
I mean in the middle of this--

29:26.400 --> 29:28.200
Sorry, excuse me.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.640
<i>We ran the plates on the car.</i>

29:33.240 --> 29:36.520
<i>It's one of ours.</i>
<i>It's registered to Erik Andersson.</i>

29:36.600 --> 29:37.520
I'm sorry.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.440
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:40.960 --> 29:43.640
The last thing we need
is a missing police car in the city.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.000
Find it quietly.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.800
Oh, and one more thing, Rask.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.400
Have you spoken to Sara Moberg?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.160
Yeah.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.680
I wanted her to hear it
from me instead of--

29:54.760 --> 29:57.040
<i>Some family liaison officer</i>
<i>whose trained job it is</i>

29:57.120 --> 29:58.840
<i>to deliver that kind of news.</i>

30:00.960 --> 30:02.920
You said
you'd keep your emotions out of it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.880
<i>It's the least she deserves.</i>

30:05.560 --> 30:08.920
I spent months with Sara Moberg
during the initial investigation.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.800
I wanted to give her some comfort.
You can call it damage control.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.760
Just find the damn car.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.560
-Attorney General Holmgren.
-Uh, Superintendent.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.800
-Congratulations on the job. Well earned.
-Thank you.

30:28.600 --> 30:33.400
I hate to talk shop,
but my unit caught the Elias Fager case.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.720
I heard. Bloody mess.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.760
It'd be really helpful if we could get
the information on Soren Fager.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.600
We'll probably need to talk to him.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.120
Right.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.440
Well, I'll do my best,
but after the press-leak debacle,

30:48.480 --> 30:51.280
frankly, people are wondering
how much your department can be trusted.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.760
Rest assured, I'll find out what happened.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.680
In the meantime,
we really could use that information.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.680
Enjoy your evening.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.280
You know, he's not even 40 yet.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.680
The guy will make attorney general
way before he's 50.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.280
I tell you, trust me. Trust.

31:09.360 --> 31:12.240
Well,
no one kisses arse like you, Freddy,

31:12.320 --> 31:14.800
so I'm sure you'll get on
like a house on fire. Get in the car.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.240
No, no, no. I'm being serious. Listen!

31:17.320 --> 31:19.560
<i>Unit 2, unit 7 has been called away</i>

31:19.640 --> 31:23.240
<i>from the North Harbor scrapyard. Please</i>
<i>proceed there and take over the search</i>

31:23.320 --> 31:27.760
<i>for a green Skoda,</i>
<i>registration Mike Lima Bravo 037.</i>

31:27.840 --> 31:29.560
Hello, Control, Car 2 here.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.880
Show us en route, ETA… How long?

31:31.960 --> 31:34.560
-About five minutes.
-Five minutes, over.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.520
<i>All units, be on lookout</i>
<i>for a green Skoda,</i>

31:53.600 --> 31:56.880
<i>registration Mike Lima Bravo 037.</i>

32:13.160 --> 32:14.760
All right, let's get this done.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.400
No.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.280
No.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.360
Hey, you got a minute?

32:51.880 --> 32:53.360
What's up, brother Kurt?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.000
I'm looking for a stolen car.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.320
Not my line of work.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.600
If you were dumping a car,
where would you take it?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.080
You're forgetting
that you're the policeman here.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.400
Plain sight.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.360
The car, I'd leave it in plain sight.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.680
In one of the estates,
by a playground with the doors open.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.640
It's an invite for a free ride.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.200
Mess up any evidence.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.640
Thanks.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.080
Hey, Kurt.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.440
If I'm right,
does that mean you owe me one?

33:30.520 --> 33:31.760
I'll add it to the list.

34:00.440 --> 34:01.280
Easy! Ah!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.800
Easy, boy. Easy. Easy.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.320
You all right there, Fred?

34:07.840 --> 34:10.280
Yeah, the next shift
will have to pick this one up.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.200
Change of plan. Let's go. Kurt's got
a lead on where the car might be.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.120
We're gonna check out some playgrounds.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.040
What?!

35:01.640 --> 35:03.160
This is ridiculous, mate.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.360
Is this all Kurt's got?

35:05.440 --> 35:07.800
Drive around the estate
like a pair of twats with hats on?

35:07.880 --> 35:09.400
Just keep your eyes peeled, Freddy.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.600
-Hold up. Hold up. There he is.
-There he is!

35:14.240 --> 35:17.400
-Fucking Kurt! I can't believe this worked.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.840
Control, this is Car 2
in pursuit of a Skoda.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.960
Registration is Mike Lima Bravo 037.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.240
Request backup.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.040
Someone's gonna get hurt here, Freddy.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.360
Turn's there, Reza! Turn! Turn!

35:38.240 --> 35:39.680
-Fuck!
-It's all right.

35:39.760 --> 35:43.040
All right, let's pull it together.
It's all right. The paths cross up ahead.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.560
All right, breathe, mate.
This is yours. This is yours.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.880
Keep it together. Keep it together.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.560
Come on, show me those skills!

36:27.880 --> 36:30.360
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Rez! Rez!

36:36.480 --> 36:38.120
Watch out, Rez!

36:42.000 --> 36:43.880
Rez, pull it together, move!

36:46.960 --> 36:47.920
Police!

36:48.000 --> 36:50.560
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

36:53.480 --> 36:54.680
-Come here!
-Run!

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
Stop there!

37:17.120 --> 37:18.280
They were too fast.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.240
Well, at least we caught
this little bastard.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.280
How're you doing, you little prick?

37:30.960 --> 37:31.960
You hurt yourself?

37:34.320 --> 37:35.200
Call it in.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.760
Control, we need medical assistance
and a fire crew.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.120
Yeah.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.720
Okay. Is he conscious?

37:48.560 --> 37:50.400
And there's people stationed there, yeah?

37:50.920 --> 37:52.040
We'll be there shortly.
