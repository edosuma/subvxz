I don't know.

03:29.834 --> 03:33.170
-We have to get him help.
-No. You need to run.

03:34.922 --> 03:37.592
My name is Danny.
I'm hunting members of the Hand.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.220
I think you're the man we're looking for.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.680
Iron Fist.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.182
Go home.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.230
You know who I am?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.024
[gasping softly]

03:53.107 --> 03:56.193
The war you're fighting... it's not here.

03:59.071 --> 04:00.782
It's in New York City.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.119
No... No! Hey!

04:05.953 --> 04:06.954
Hey.

Go home.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.634
[sighs] Come on,
the night's just getting started.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.968

05:50.892 --> 05:52.977
-[truck horn honks]
-No!

05:54.103 --> 05:56.147
Excuse me! Excuse me, sir!

05:56.230 --> 05:57.440
No, um, I'm so sorry.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.108
-This is my car.
-Not anymore.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.736
At nine a.m., it became city property.
Loading zone only.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.655
-Please. I can move it.
-Not once it's hitched.

06:03.738 --> 06:08.117
But you can come to the impound on 49th
to reclaim it any time before six p.m.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.703
Lloyd, what the hell are you doing?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.751
What?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.546
We got a problem?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.088
[Trish] I got a call yesterday.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.299
A second producer
who wants to tell your story.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.383
Hard pass.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.302
New York loves a winner,
and like it or not,

06:26.385 --> 06:29.180
you stood up
to a really awful person and won.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.390
You know how much publicists charge
for that kind of attention?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.517
How much to make it stop?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.519
I'm just saying,
you might wanna consider it.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.439
It could help keep your bills paid
until you start working again.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.273
-My bills aren't a problem.
-Not yet.

06:39.356 --> 06:41.526
Have you at least started
answering the phone?

06:42.401 --> 06:43.736
[sighs]

06:43.820 --> 06:47.114
Only you could turn
that big personal victory into a defeat.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.992
-You know what your problem is?
-Sentences that start like that.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.369
You're not comfortable
with what you've become.

06:52.454 --> 06:56.290
-Jessica, you are now a full-blown super--
-Do not say the H-word.

06:56.373 --> 06:59.168
-Jess, I--
-I've got enough of a headache as it is.

06:59.251 --> 07:01.337
I'm just saying,
you might wanna consider going home,

07:01.420 --> 07:03.965
getting some sleep, rejoining society.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.424
I'm talking to you.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.009
And I appreciate that.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.848
-Is there whiskey in this?
-Oh, yeah, that's mine.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.105
[inmates cheering]

07:41.753 --> 07:44.005
Looks like all
of your paper-pushing worked.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.635
Uncuff the superstar.
Get him out of my sight.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.271
My bad.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.066
These belong to you.

08:15.452 --> 08:17.288
[door alarm buzzing]

08:21.125 --> 08:23.294
Mr. Lucas? Mr. Cage?

08:24.086 --> 08:26.714
-Which do you prefer? I forget.
-Cage.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.177
-Do I know you?
-Franklin Nelson.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.806
I ran point on your case.
We spoke on the phone... a lot.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.390
You spoke a lot.

08:36.473 --> 08:38.059
[stammers] As long as it worked.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.854
-I appreciate it.
-Appreciate your friend Bobby Fish.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.148
We all did some impressive book-cracking.

08:44.231 --> 08:48.027
Plus, you made it through a prison stint
without throwing a single punch.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.779
I'm sure that was hard
for a person with your...

08:49.862 --> 08:51.739
-I know.
-...reputation.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.535
-[sighs] Is, uh... Claire coming?
-It's lawyers only in here.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.288
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a bus to catch.

08:59.371 --> 09:02.291
Of course. Uh, just one last thing.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.629
The law firm of Hogarth, Chao &amp; Benowitz
is at your disposal.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.131
-In case you need help starting over.
-[door alarm buzzing]

09:09.215 --> 09:10.800
I'm not starting over, Mr. Nelson.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.219
I'm moving forward.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.680
People call me Foggy.

09:15.763 --> 09:16.764
And you let them?

09:17.389 --> 09:18.558
[chuckles]

09:24.105 --> 09:26.148
[Matt] You're on record as saying
that the new subway station

09:26.232 --> 09:29.944
at 50th and 10th would be, quote,
"good for the community."

09:30.027 --> 09:33.405
Would be quote-- quote, unquote,
"good for the community."

09:33.489 --> 09:36.492
-Mr. Berkowitz, in your professional--
-[tires screeching in distance]

09:36.576 --> 09:37.952
[cars colliding]

09:38.035 --> 09:40.580
-[car door opens and closes]
-[man 1] What the hell are you doing?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.498
[man 2] 'Sup, man?
I'll bust your goddamn head!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.667
-[man 1] Oh, yeah? Let's go, then.
-[man 2] What's up?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.294
-[man 1] You wanna try something?
-[man 2] Come at me. Let's go!

09:47.378 --> 09:48.713
[police siren blares]

09:49.421 --> 09:51.924
[officer] NYPD! Break it up!
That's enough.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.886
-You, up on the sidewalk.
-[man 2] Yes, sir, officer.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.641
Mr. Berkowitz...

09:59.724 --> 10:02.559
In your professional opinion,
was it good for Aaron James?

10:02.644 --> 10:05.479
Our sympathies go out to the family.
The whole thing... It's very unfortunate.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.524
Were you aware the products used in your
new station were hazardous to children?

10:08.608 --> 10:09.901
-Objection!
-I'll rephrase.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.195
-What was attractive about Endexoprene?
-It's strong. It's durable.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.990
-And half the price?
-Well, I do run a business.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.575
Is it worth endangering people
in the interest of saving money?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.162
All materials are tested.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.789
The moment those findings
were made public,

10:22.872 --> 10:25.416
our company replaced that mortar
in all remaining stations.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.334
"Made public."

10:29.962 --> 10:31.130
What do you mean?

10:32.464 --> 10:35.342
Are you referring to a report released
on September 29th?

10:35.426 --> 10:38.805
Your Honor, he's asking my client
to respond with unreasonable specificity.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.016
Mr. Berkowitz, if memory serves me right,
your office received an urgent delivery

10:42.099 --> 10:44.936
from the Safety Commission on June 3rd.
Three months earlier.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.104
I'm curious, did that have anything
to do with Endexoprene?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.230
[Berkowitz] I don't know
anything about that.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.481
Your Honor, unless Mr. Murdock

10:49.565 --> 10:52.819
can prove my client actually received
these hypothetical documents, then--

10:52.902 --> 10:55.696
It's not about whether he received them.
It's whether he willfully ignored them.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.282
Your Honor, I ask that this record
of delivery be admitted into evidence.

10:58.365 --> 11:01.410
-[stammers] I mean, I get a lot of those.
-What would you say is worse?

11:01.493 --> 11:03.370
Ignoring data
in the interest of cutting costs?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.665
Or neglecting to supply the court
with records that might prove

11:05.748 --> 11:07.166
you purposely put people in danger?

11:07.249 --> 11:08.500
-Including--
-[attorney] Your Honor--

11:08.584 --> 11:11.253
Including this young man, Aaron James,
who might never walk again.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.340
-Your Honor, we would like a recess.
-[scoffs] No need. I'm done.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.633
I think he is, too.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.097
[whispering]

11:25.727 --> 11:28.437
-[Aaron's mother] $11 million!
-[Matt chuckles]

11:29.146 --> 11:30.356
Thank you, Mr. Murdock.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.399
-Oh, my pleasure.
-Thank you.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
[Matt] I'm so happy for you.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.444
[Matt chuckles]

11:35.527 --> 11:37.238
[reporters clamoring]

11:38.197 --> 11:39.240
God.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.242
[indistinct chatter]

11:42.118 --> 11:43.119
Hey.

11:44.536 --> 11:46.998
-You okay?
-Yeah.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.171
Mind if I tell you something?

11:55.547 --> 11:56.758
Sure.

11:59.426 --> 12:01.595
That money
is really gonna help your parents.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.558
But for you, from here on out...
it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.479
You realize you're only at mile one
of the marathon...

12:11.773 --> 12:12.774
right?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.860
Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.320
Doctors are gonna tell you
to stay positive.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.281
Your family's gonna tell you not
to feel sorry for yourself.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.199
Your therapist is gonna tell you not
to be angry--

12:22.283 --> 12:23.659
I'm already angry.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.287
At who?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.082
Everyone.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.920
I just want my life back.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.504
They can't give you that.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.009
Maybe you'll walk again.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.886
I hope so.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.014
But maybe you won't.

12:46.015 --> 12:50.311
But your ability to get through it...
as this gets harder...

12:51.353 --> 12:54.523
that is a hundred times more powerful
than slapping a smile on your face

12:54.606 --> 12:56.525
and pretending
like everything's just fine.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.196
-[sighs]
-Do you understand?

13:03.157 --> 13:04.700
Hey, listen...

13:05.617 --> 13:07.619
no one can give you your life back, Aaron.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.874
You have... You gotta take it back.

13:14.668 --> 13:15.878
[sniffles]

13:16.795 --> 13:17.796
[sighs]

13:18.923 --> 13:19.924
Let's go.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.094
[Aaron exhales heavily]

13:24.636 --> 13:26.680
[reporters clamoring]

13:36.523 --> 13:37.691
[sighs]

13:38.775 --> 13:40.569
Congratulations, Mr. Murdock.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.990
Oh. Thank you, Ms. Page.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.744
It's okay. You can be proud of yourself.
A little. I won't tell anyone.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.830
You, uh, here for a statement?

13:52.581 --> 13:53.665
Uh, yeah.

13:55.376 --> 13:59.171
Hey, you maybe wanna go...
do that over a bite or...

14:00.464 --> 14:02.674
Oh, uh... [stutters] Sure, yeah.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.802
-Um... can you give me five minutes?
-Mm-hmm.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.015
[sighs]

14:09.098 --> 14:11.851
-[reporter 1] Mr. Murdock...
-[reporter 2] Mr. Murdock, sir...

14:11.934 --> 14:12.852
Yes...

14:59.065 --> 15:00.274
[sighs]

15:04.736 --> 15:06.072
[exhales heavily]

15:07.990 --> 15:10.201
[woman screaming in distance]

15:12.828 --> 15:14.496
[people screaming]

15:23.589 --> 15:26.342
[swords clashing]

15:45.486 --> 15:47.071
[screaming continues]

16:04.796 --> 16:06.048
[gasping]

16:07.008 --> 16:08.217
You abandoned them.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.721
Because of you, the Hand has won.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.057
I'm sorry.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.392
After they raised you...

16:17.143 --> 16:19.270
after they gave you everything you are...

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
you let them die.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.524
No. [groans]

16:24.108 --> 16:25.276
No!

16:27.236 --> 16:29.238
-[Colleen] Danny. Wake up.
-No!

16:29.321 --> 16:30.781
No!

16:30.864 --> 16:31.865
Danny.

16:31.948 --> 16:34.076
[yells and breathes heavily]

16:36.328 --> 16:37.413
You okay?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.707
[sighs]

16:41.542 --> 16:42.709
Yeah.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.879
It's just the...
It's just the turbulence.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.883
[sighs] I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.055
[sighs]

16:58.600 --> 17:00.811
-Danny...
-[sighs] I'm...

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
I'm gonna go check with the pilot.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.652
Danny.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.781
Are you gonna talk to me
about whatever's on your mind?

17:12.864 --> 17:14.075
[sighs]

17:15.159 --> 17:16.410
Look, it was...

17:17.411 --> 17:18.745
It was nothing.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.457
You were screaming. Again.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.213
-I'm fine.
-[scoffs]

17:28.422 --> 17:31.092
I think we have different understandings
of the word "fine."

17:35.137 --> 17:36.347
[Danny sighs]

17:39.225 --> 17:41.352
We've been chasing the Hand for months.

17:43.895 --> 17:46.898
We finally get a lead on a guy
who can supposedly help us...

17:47.774 --> 17:50.026
and we get there just in time
to watch him die.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.654
-It is not your fault.
-[scoffs]

17:54.323 --> 17:55.657
I let that woman escape.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.535
You didn't let anyone do anything.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.372
Whoever she was, she moved faster
than anyone I've ever seen.

18:02.038 --> 18:03.457
[scoffs] Yeah.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.668
She hit like it, too.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.003
[scoffs]

18:11.757 --> 18:14.093
It had to be the Hand, right?

18:15.802 --> 18:16.970
I don't know.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.308
There are a lot of things
that the Hand kept from me.

18:23.810 --> 18:26.480
[sighs] They're not the kind of problem
that's gonna go away easily,

18:26.563 --> 18:28.107
but we can figure this out.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.317
Together.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.075
What do they want in New York?

18:40.244 --> 18:41.662
[sighs]

19:04.435 --> 19:07.188
You'll need to disrobe. Jewelry and all.

19:30.001 --> 19:31.337
[woman sighs]

19:36.967 --> 19:38.385
[knocking on door]

19:40.762 --> 19:42.138
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.603
The results of the last round of tests
were explained to you, yes?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.482
They're rather conclusive, I'm afraid.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.486
And by that, of course,
what I mean to say is--

19:55.569 --> 19:56.778
I'm dying.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.575
My red blood cell count
has dropped precipitously

20:01.658 --> 20:05.579
and almost every one of my major organs
is close to collapse.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.374
Is that still the case?

20:11.502 --> 20:12.919
What can you do to treat it?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.589
To be honest,
this kind of free fall is off the charts.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.007
That's not helpful.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.175
Or even what I asked.

20:19.801 --> 20:23.472
Well, unfortunately,
even for someone with your resources...

20:24.515 --> 20:26.182
there's not much we can do.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.648
Um...

20:34.190 --> 20:35.901
how much time do I have left?

20:36.943 --> 20:39.821
Could be months. Could be weeks.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.075
I think this should give us
more definitive answers.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.452
Please.

21:04.846 --> 21:05.931
Let's begin.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.354
[MRI machine whirring]

21:15.857 --> 21:17.150
[elevator bell chimes]

21:22.948 --> 21:24.616
Jesus. Shit.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.159
[woman] Ms. Jones?

21:27.035 --> 21:29.288
-[sighs]
-My name is Michelle Raymond.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.790
This is my daughter, Lexi.
We need your help.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.625
I can't.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.086
I'm sorry. We weren't sure
if we were in the right place.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.630
Not today. Probably not tomorrow, either.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.591
-Come on, Mom.
-I read about what you did.

21:40.674 --> 21:41.717
She doesn't give a shit.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.595
-My husband is missing.
-She's a walking shit show anyway.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.929
[Michelle sighs]

21:46.012 --> 21:47.681
-Excuse me?
-Lexi, please.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.435
We are not doing great.
He has been gone a full week.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.395
-[sighs] Did you call the cops?
-No.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.482
-Why not? They're free.
-Money is not an issue.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.694
Something is wrong and I know it.
John's like clockwork.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.780
He's an architect.
He goes to work every morning at eight.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.574
He comes back home every night at 6:30.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.159
-But lately, he's--
-He's been different? Secretive?

22:08.243 --> 22:10.454
-Maybe even a little nervous?
-And it's not like him.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.248
Because he's cheating on you, okay?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.959
Nothing to be ashamed about.
It happens all the time.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.044
-You don't know him like I do.
-I don't need to.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.089
But you came to me and I'm giving you
my professional opinion.

22:21.172 --> 22:22.799
You need a divorce lawyer.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.553
Thank you for your time, Ms. Jones.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.890
Yeah, thanks so much.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.102
[sighs] Hey.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.484
Whatever he's doing...
I hope you find him.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.326
[sighs]

22:55.457 --> 22:57.000
[phone ringing]

22:58.752 --> 23:00.879
-[Jessica on voice mail] Wrong number.
-[beeps]

23:00.962 --> 23:02.338
[distorted voice] Jessica Jones,

23:02.423 --> 23:05.426
do yourself a favor
and don't look for John Raymond.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.928
-Hello?
-[dial tone]

23:44.214 --> 23:46.049
[indistinct chatter]

24:09.740 --> 24:10.949
Hey, stranger.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.579
Should we get that coffee?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.383
[both grunting]

24:35.348 --> 24:37.350
Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.812
For all I knew,
you could've sucked at this.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.564
[chuckles] Yeah?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.733
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, I hope I was worth it.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.527
You got potential.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.612
-"Potential"? Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.321
-Mm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

24:55.118 --> 24:57.913
There were some really rough days inside.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.000
But your letters...
they got me through it.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.836
[scoffs] I can't remember the last time
I handwrote a letter.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.129
[chuckles]

25:07.172 --> 25:09.841
-There was that poem that one time.
-Oh, God.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.303
-No, it was a good one.
-[inhales deeply] Thank you.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.640
-I mean, it was also Nikki Giovanni.
-Shh!

25:16.723 --> 25:19.893
-Yeah. [clicks tongue]
-We all can't be your corny ass.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.812
Hey, I'd rather be corny than
to plagiarize.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.063
Ow! [chuckles]

25:23.146 --> 25:25.357
There was something else I noticed
about your letters...

25:26.232 --> 25:27.483
What you didn't say.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.737
-[clicks tongue] Luke--
-Look, I know the drill.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.574
Man goes inside, you think
there are things you can't tell him.

25:34.407 --> 25:38.369
But whatever's going on in Harlem...
I'm gonna find out.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.290
Look, can't we just enjoy this part
a little longer?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.004
I need to know.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.591
Harlem's gone through changes.

25:52.258 --> 25:54.010
It was bound to happen.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.220
What's Mariah doing?

25:55.303 --> 25:57.555
The same shit she was doing when you left.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.436
Look, right now, the only thing
you need to worry about is you.

26:03.519 --> 26:05.355
Look, if you're talking
about getting a job,

26:05.438 --> 26:07.608
I have every intention of doing just that.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.900
Doing what?

26:09.610 --> 26:13.697
How does being Harlem's hero
allow you to live an actual life?

26:13.780 --> 26:15.323
I'll find a way.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.243
Right now, just...

26:18.952 --> 26:20.453
I just wanna help people.

26:20.536 --> 26:22.122
I wanna do that, too.

26:23.373 --> 26:27.293
But call me selfish...
I wanna see you take care of yourself.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.341
[knocking on door]

26:36.177 --> 26:37.428
[sighs]

26:38.138 --> 26:39.430
[Misty] Hello?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.399
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.192
-Good look.
-Thanks.

26:53.069 --> 26:58.574
Sorry to interrupt. [chuckles]
But I'm glad to see you're settling in.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.370
Hey, Misty. It's good to see you.

27:02.453 --> 27:03.872
Good to see you, too, Luke.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.708
How did you know where to find me?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.294
Are you kidding?
You're the hero of Harlem.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.546
Wanna come for a walk?

27:12.505 --> 27:15.591
-Actually, I was, uh--
-It won't take long, I promise.

27:25.476 --> 27:26.602
[chuckles]

27:31.232 --> 27:32.483
[cook] Number two in the window.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.112
[Matt] Great story last week.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.364
The, uh...
thing with the school board scandal.

27:38.448 --> 27:42.410
Thank you. Yeah, Ellison's pretty much
given me free reign. [chuckles]

27:42.493 --> 27:45.288
It feels like what
I'm meant to be doing or...

27:45.371 --> 27:47.582
[stammers] I don't know
if that makes any sense.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.335
Yeah. Of course.

27:51.627 --> 27:53.463
It looks like you're doing
what you always wanted to.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.675
Yeah, it's been a transition
from the Nelson and Murdock days,

27:57.759 --> 27:59.970
from the partnership but, uh...

28:00.721 --> 28:03.139
No, the pro bono work does make me happy.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.225
-That's great. That's really--
-[waitress] Coffee?

28:05.308 --> 28:07.060
-Yes, thank you.
-Thanks.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.651
Sugar's on the left.
Cream's here on the right.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.238
-Cream on the right. Thank you.
-Yes. You're welcome.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.034
-Sorry, it got...
-Yeah.

28:24.535 --> 28:26.662
Do you wish you'd kept
your secret to yourself?

28:27.705 --> 28:28.706
No.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.626
I needed you to know.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.839
I don't know what I expected, but I...
I know I couldn't lie to you anymore.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.340
[chuckles]

28:38.633 --> 28:40.176
Thanks. I appreciate that.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.097
Do you miss it?

28:45.140 --> 28:46.182
The suit? The mask?

28:47.517 --> 28:48.518
No.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.147
It feels like a chapter of my life
that's closed.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.900
Now, I don't regret it.
You know, I just...

28:54.983 --> 28:57.693
-I regret that it drove some people away.
-No, it...

28:57.778 --> 29:00.071
Look, it didn't drive me away. I just...

29:01.447 --> 29:05.535
You know, I felt like we should figure
ourselves out first or something.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.121
I'm trying.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.290
Hmm.

29:13.877 --> 29:18.548
You know, as complicated as I feel
about all this stuff, I just...

29:20.216 --> 29:21.717
I feel like you should know.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.679
The NYPD is prevailing.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.266
I report on it every day,
and crime rate's down.

29:28.349 --> 29:32.062
I really think that Daredevil
may have made the city a safer place.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.022
[chuckles]

29:35.023 --> 29:36.232
He might have.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.360
But right now,
the city's better off without him.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.528
Hmm.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.158
-Well, it's better off with Matt Murdock.
-[chuckles]

29:48.161 --> 29:49.620
Speaking of which, Mr. Murdock...

29:50.746 --> 29:55.501
I would like to take your statement
on today's miraculous Aaron James verdict.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.170
-Hit me.
-[chuckles]

30:07.263 --> 30:08.139
[Malcolm] Hey.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.640
-No.
-What?

30:09.724 --> 30:12.560
We are not doing that thing
where you come in here like you live here.

30:12.643 --> 30:14.855
-You gave me a key.
-You took the spare key

30:14.938 --> 30:17.065
when you changed the locks
without my permission.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.234
Door was broken,
and I was doing you a favor.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.987
-[sighs] What do you want, Malcolm?
-Just came for soda.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.447
-Ooh! So what are we doing?
-We are doing nothing.

30:24.530 --> 30:26.532
You took a case. I can tell.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.535
-You've got that glow about you.
-[sighs] I did not take a case...

30:29.619 --> 30:31.162
-yet.
-Who is that?

30:31.246 --> 30:33.789
-Don't read over my shoulder.
-Okay.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.458
It's an architect, huh?

30:35.541 --> 30:37.710
-Another cheater?
-[Jessica sighs] Maybe.

30:37.793 --> 30:39.963
His wife showed up desperate to find him.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.965
She said a bunch of stuff
I've heard before.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.384
You know, "He's squeaky clean.
This is unlike him."

30:45.093 --> 30:46.636
But then I got a call.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.347
Someone used a voice scrambler
and told me not to take the case.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.557
[chuckles] Bet you loved that, didn't you?

30:52.350 --> 30:53.643
Graduated MIT.

30:53.726 --> 30:57.063
Designed two skyscrapers in Dubai
and four in Manhattan.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.357
He is squeaky clean.
You think she's right?

30:59.440 --> 31:01.943
Maybe.
Maybe he's tired of being the good guy.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.654
Maybe he's on a bender.
Maybe he's knee-deep in some intern.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.197
-Gross.
-Very.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.823
So, what are your leads?

31:08.449 --> 31:11.327
I'm not looking for leads, Malcolm,
because I haven't take the case.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.579
Yeah, right.
Have you tried tracking the call yet?

31:13.663 --> 31:16.291
[sighs] It doesn't work that way.
You can reroute phone numbers.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.918
I mean, maybe he didn't, though.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.962
Maybe he's just a regular guy
trying to throw you off the scent.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.381
-Maybe--
-Maybe he's an amateur.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.266
Hi. I just got a call
from a blocked number.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.810
I was wondering if you can tell me
where it was coming from.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.605
Is there anything that you can do?

31:39.689 --> 31:42.442
You know, I think it's my grandfather
and he's senile

31:42.525 --> 31:44.277
and he might be trying
to get a hold of me.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.154
Actually,
I have a missing person's report.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.073
I have the number right in front of me.
I can read it to you if you want.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.618
Really? Thank you so much.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.122
Who the hell uses pay phones anymore?

31:56.831 --> 31:59.918
-[scoffs] Where?
-11th and 49th.

32:04.422 --> 32:05.924
Ugh, I know this place.

32:06.967 --> 32:10.386
If your guy's doing shady shit
on that block, that's where he is.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.596
I used to do heroin.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.974
I don't know much, but I know
where people go to get off the grid.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.608
-Does this mean you're taking the case?
-I want my key back.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.443
And get out of my apartment!

32:26.152 --> 32:27.278
Still in the force?

32:28.196 --> 32:31.366
Just 'cause you took down Diamondback,
doesn't mean crime went away.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.243
We took down Diamondback.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.911
And now I'm ready to take down
Mariah and Shades.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.581
[chuckles] I wish it was that easy.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.584
I know their hands are in something.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.879
Maybe you need another assist
from outside the law.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.424
-From somebody fresh out of lockup?
-[chuckles] That's behind me.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.303
Now that I've cleared up my past,
I've got nothing to hide.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.305
Look, my team is on it.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.059
But Harlem could use your help...

32:58.143 --> 32:59.769
once you're done spending nights
with the nurse

32:59.852 --> 33:04.065
-who tied the ribbon round the oak tree.
-[chuckles] Your team, eh?

33:04.815 --> 33:07.735
When you left,
I got put on a city-wide task force.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.904
Sounds like a promotion.

33:10.821 --> 33:14.325
All I can say is my beat
isn't just Harlem anymore.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.620
Now, make no mistake, this is still home.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.124
-The good and the bad.
-What happened here?

33:21.207 --> 33:24.877
Officially, 25-year-old male
found deceased in a parked car.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.380
And unofficially?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.341
I think somebody's
been using Harlem's youth

33:30.425 --> 33:33.928
for what can only be described
as late-night duty.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.805
-Couriers?
-Maybe.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.016
Might even be related to Mariah.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.685
You think it's something else.

33:40.768 --> 33:45.356
Seven in the last few months.
Always the same story.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.109
Harlem 20-something
moves his mom out of the projects

33:48.193 --> 33:51.529
into a nice home in New Rochelle.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.780
Down payment in cash.

33:53.864 --> 33:55.075
What's the connection between them?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.160
Run their names, you talk to people...

33:57.243 --> 34:00.746
No guns, no drugs,
just a new job, off the books.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.707
Doing what? Nobody knows.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.750
[Luke] Hmm.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.254
You ready for the real sad part?

34:09.172 --> 34:12.842
You remember Candace?
This close to testifying against Mariah?

34:12.925 --> 34:14.552
Murder still unsolved?

34:15.928 --> 34:18.013
That was his sister.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.350
[Luke sighs]

34:21.726 --> 34:23.269
Now there's only one.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.813
You should've heard
the way their mother cried.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.315
[Luke sighs]

34:29.525 --> 34:30.901
How much can you let me in on this?

34:31.486 --> 34:32.945
I'll find who's behind it.

34:33.988 --> 34:35.740
[chuckles] You could do that.

34:36.449 --> 34:41.036
Or you could help guide this young man
in a different direction.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.038
The way Pop used to.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.378
[man 1] You hear about that cat
that cleaned up Crispus Attucks?

34:48.461 --> 34:49.920
That's him, man.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.467
[man 2] Heard he was locked up
somewhere down in Georgia.

35:07.772 --> 35:08.981
[sighs]

35:15.196 --> 35:17.782
Uh, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

35:19.284 --> 35:24.914
It's been... [sighs]
uh, three days since my last confession.

35:28.834 --> 35:32.547
I lied to someone. [sighs]
Someone I love.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.676
She asked me if I, uh, miss the life.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.764
The other life that I led.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.394
[chuckles] And I told her I didn't.

35:46.977 --> 35:50.856
[Lantom] Acknowledging a lie is often
the best path to finding the truth, son.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.734
A lie like this one...

35:54.902 --> 35:56.737
is often a sign of indecision.

35:57.322 --> 36:01.492
A sign that your mind and your soul
are not yet aligned.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.330
Well, I'm trying very hard
to ignore my soul. [chuckles softly]

36:05.996 --> 36:08.666
[Lantom] "The Lord sees not as man sees.

36:08.749 --> 36:13.921
Man looks on the outward appearance,
but the Lord... looks on the heart."

36:14.922 --> 36:16.507
If you could elaborate, Father.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.510
Ignoring doesn't change anything, Matthew.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.136
God knows your heart.

36:21.887 --> 36:24.557
Let him in so he can help.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.768
-Even if that heart is damaged?
-Especially if it's damaged.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.856
Matthew, I want to talk frankly.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.735
-Please.
-This other life you led...

36:37.778 --> 36:39.614
is your heart still with it...

36:40.781 --> 36:44.202
or is your heart with the one
who walked through it by your side?

36:46.036 --> 36:47.705
Elektra. Yeah.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.665
I do miss her.

36:52.252 --> 36:55.296
But I know that the things
she brought out of me were wrong.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.172
From what you've told me about her,

36:57.257 --> 37:00.218
I think she'd be happy
about how well you're doing.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.302
Maybe.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.055
Or maybe she'd tell me
I'm abandoning that life.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.057
And with it, her memory.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.935
You're not abandoning Elektra.
You don't have it in you.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.232
What you're doing, we call that moving on.

37:15.190 --> 37:18.361
Purgatory is a place for the dead,
Matthew, not the living.

37:18.444 --> 37:21.071
There's nothing wrong
with letting people go.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.699
She'll find her peace.

37:27.202 --> 37:29.622
I pray you find yours as well.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.919
[cooing]

37:50.393 --> 37:52.270
You always liked this spot.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.857
It's a miracle...

37:58.150 --> 38:00.736
the fact that this park even exists.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.784
The fact that this city
hasn't torn it down to put up high-rises.

38:10.413 --> 38:16.502
Must be hard for these people to imagine
the whole island of Manhattan as a forest.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.508
You know, the Dutch colonists...

38:24.134 --> 38:26.762
when they bought Manhattan
from the natives,

38:26.846 --> 38:31.517
they're said to have acquired
the whole thing for... $24.

38:32.602 --> 38:33.936
[chuckles]

38:34.729 --> 38:38.858
-Ask me, they overpaid.
-[chuckles]

38:41.861 --> 38:45.365
The contact at the mayor's office...
he's ready.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.201
-How soon can we begin?
-Three months.

38:49.284 --> 38:51.371
Then we move to the final phase.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.623
That won't work. Not anymore.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.585
-We need to move faster.
-We all agreed.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.505
-This plan, it makes sense.
-Made sense.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.425
[stammers] It took great efforts
to arrange this.

39:05.050 --> 39:08.513
If we speed the process,
it will not be quiet.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.598
I'm aware.

39:14.309 --> 39:16.270
I will inform the others.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.815
Good. Send my regards when you do.

39:22.443 --> 39:26.697
And, uh...
finish feeding the birds, will you?

39:29.409 --> 39:31.118
They're starving today.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.212
[hip-hop music playing in distance]

39:54.892 --> 39:56.394
[men laughing]

39:57.603 --> 39:59.146
You guys know where I can find Cole?

39:59.897 --> 40:01.190
What's it to you?

40:07.362 --> 40:08.573
Uh, one floor up.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.491
Thanks.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.291
[music playing loudly]

40:33.097 --> 40:36.642
-[Luke turns volume down]
-Man, I told y'all to stop playing!

40:38.352 --> 40:40.020
I'm here to pay my respects.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.066
Cage.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.652
I know who you are.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.701
-Did you know Sean?
-No.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.579
But I knew your sister Candace.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.874
I guess I'm here
to pay my respects for her, too.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.667
This family's got some luck, huh?

41:03.628 --> 41:07.089
Around here, bad things have a tendency
to happen to good people.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.510
Do you think your brother's death
could somehow be related to hers?

41:11.594 --> 41:13.053
No. I don't think...

41:15.598 --> 41:19.101
No, what happened to Sean was, um...
was more like an accident.

41:20.185 --> 41:21.979
-You sure about that?
-Yeah.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.692
I heard he got a new job.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.653
I ain't know nothing about that.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.616
I mean, we didn't talk about everything.
That was his business.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.576
Of course.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.496
What about you?

41:39.204 --> 41:40.247
What?

41:42.332 --> 41:44.001
[Luke] Things seem to be going okay.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.379
Did you get a new gig?

41:49.256 --> 41:52.802
No. [chuckles]
I'm just in between stuff right now.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.345
I'm always on that hustle, though.
You feel me?

41:55.429 --> 41:56.556
I do.

41:59.308 --> 42:02.477
Listen... I can help you.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.523
Hypothetically speaking,
if you ever need anything...

42:06.065 --> 42:07.357
I think you should go.

42:09.068 --> 42:13.864
Ask anybody on this block what I've done.
Or what I'm willing to do.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.241
You could trust me.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.493
-It's too late for all of that.
-What do you mean, "It's too late"?

42:18.578 --> 42:20.162
-Nothing.
-Son, it's never too late--

42:20.245 --> 42:21.956
Yo, man, I ain't your son!

42:22.665 --> 42:24.834
I told you, I don't know a damn thing.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.381
Whatever you're doing,
you're gonna get yourself hurt.

42:33.342 --> 42:34.885
Think about your mom.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.388
What she's already been through.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.817
I think you should go.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.322
The only way to help me
is to make me bulletproof, too.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.119
It's too late for heroes.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.123
Hero's your word. Not mine.

43:17.302 --> 43:20.430
-[man 1] I want my money.
-[man 2] I hear you. I'm gonna get it.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.557
[man 1] You got till the end of the day,

43:22.642 --> 43:24.559
or I'm coming back here
to bust some shit up!

43:25.519 --> 43:27.897
-[woman screaming]
-[man grunting]

43:27.980 --> 43:29.231
[woman moaning]

43:45.831 --> 43:46.832
[dog barking]

43:46.916 --> 43:49.293
Hey, John Raymond, it's Jessica Jones.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.088
I'm, uh... returning your call.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.382
You remember the one
where you tried to scare me?

43:57.551 --> 43:58.761
[sighs]

44:00.429 --> 44:03.015
The guy downstairs said you were here.

44:03.766 --> 44:07.144
Dude, I don't care what weird shit
you're into, but we gotta talk.

44:10.773 --> 44:13.025
All right, well,
you're gonna pay for this.

44:16.486 --> 44:18.656
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

44:51.146 --> 44:54.191
...and help stimulate
a slow Eurozone economy...

45:03.951 --> 45:05.244
Holy shit.

45:16.713 --> 45:17.547
Thank you.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.228
We made arrangements, as you requested.

45:34.731 --> 45:38.944
Are you certain about this?
There's still time to think it through.

45:40.237 --> 45:41.280
You can go.

45:45.700 --> 45:46.994
[sighs]

45:57.004 --> 46:00.007
-[Colleen] Greatest city in the world.
-[Danny] Yeah.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.301
New Yorkers like saying that.

46:04.386 --> 46:07.181
Still, after all this time, I...

46:09.016 --> 46:10.434
I don't know how I feel about it.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.814
That's the beauty of it.
It can be whatever you need it to be.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.192
What do you need it to be?

46:19.776 --> 46:20.777
Home.

46:35.167 --> 46:36.376
[sighs]

46:56.105 --> 46:58.815

to watching them fall.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.301
[rumbling stops]

48:57.642 --> 48:59.769
[man in distance] We gotta get down
right away. Take the stairs!

48:59.853 --> 49:01.313
Get down the stairs!
