WEBVTT

00:39.850 --> 00:41.044
I now bring to your attention

00:41.117 --> 00:45.713
one of the most stunning treasures
in the British Library's entire collection.

00:45.789 --> 00:47.450
The Magna Carta.

00:59.836 --> 01:01.098
And now, over here,

01:01.838 --> 01:06.502
perhaps the most cherished
ancient artifact in the Western world.

01:07.244 --> 01:09.041
The Shroud of Turin.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.359
The Imperial Sword!

01:42.012 --> 01:45.072
Chief Inspector Dreyfus is here to see you.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.013
- Chief Inspector.
- Sir.

01:47.784 --> 01:50.014
I'm sure you know why you're here.

01:50.086 --> 01:53.544
The British, the Italians and the Japanese
are assembling an elite squad

01:53.623 --> 01:55.716
of their finest detectives,

01:55.792 --> 02:00.820
an international Dream Team
to track down this Tornado.

02:00.897 --> 02:04.355
- And France will be represented?
- Exactly.

02:05.135 --> 02:08.332
I am honored, but not surprised.

02:08.405 --> 02:11.602
This is the culmination of my career.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.208
The moment
that I've been waiting for all my life.

02:15.278 --> 02:17.508
- No, no, no.
- Well, not all my life, perhaps...

02:17.580 --> 02:19.445
- No, no.
- No. Nevertheless...

02:19.516 --> 02:23.680
They want Clouseau, since he is
considered the top detective in the world.

02:23.753 --> 02:28.122
We have been asked if Clouseau
is available to lead the Dream Team.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.659
- Clouseau?
- Yes, yes.

02:35.966 --> 02:39.197
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, not at all.

02:39.269 --> 02:42.261
Would you mind if I use your bathroom
just for a moment?

02:42.339 --> 02:44.204
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

02:49.245 --> 02:50.576
Clouseau.

03:07.630 --> 03:10.963
I'm afraid, sir,
that Clouseau is currently occupied.

03:11.034 --> 03:12.661
- What?
- I've assigned him to a mission

03:12.736 --> 03:13.964
so important for our country

03:14.037 --> 03:18.371
that I fear for our national security
if he was taken off it.

03:36.292 --> 03:38.089
Clearly a violation.

03:39.829 --> 03:41.387
Parking ticket.

03:42.599 --> 03:43.930
What is this for?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.437
Thirty-one centimeters from the curb,
nine centimeters too far.

03:49.472 --> 03:54.466
Nine centimeters into
the seamy black underbelly of crime.

04:08.992 --> 04:12.086
- You must take the ticket. Take it.
- Never!

04:12.762 --> 04:14.753
You must take the ticket.

04:23.673 --> 04:26.301
You're not wearing your seatbelt.

04:26.376 --> 04:29.368
You are going to have to go
to traffic school.

04:37.287 --> 04:38.686
Pardon me.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.559
- Stop this car immediately.
- Okay.

08:00.590 --> 08:02.285
Right.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.883
- Are you finished yet?
- Complete and operational.

08:04.961 --> 08:08.453
Chief Inspector,
your new system will monitor and record

08:08.531 --> 08:11.022
every word and every movement
in this room.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.159
So, if anyone breaks in, what happens?

08:13.236 --> 08:17.866
Your office is linked to the elite
Black Berets. They will be here in seconds.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.875
<i>Sir, Inspector Clouseau is here to see you.</i>

08:22.445 --> 08:23.537
Send him in.

08:23.613 --> 08:26.980
- Clouseau?
- I have to appoint him to the Dream Team.

08:27.050 --> 08:29.917
- Clouseau?
- Don't ask, don't...

08:29.986 --> 08:33.547
Good afternoon, Chief Inspector.
I'm here with my report.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.289
This darn Medal of Honor.

08:36.359 --> 08:38.986
You're so fortunate
you never got one, Chief Inspector.

08:39.062 --> 08:44.056
You look so tidy having no honors
or other forms of distinguishing decor.

08:44.133 --> 08:47.864
Why don't you wear it under your shirt,
you know, out of sight?

08:47.937 --> 08:51.964
Brilliant idea, Chief Inspector.
That way it won't clang around.

08:52.508 --> 08:55.136
Now, the parking ticket situation.

08:55.211 --> 08:59.113
Over the last six weeks,
I've given out almost four parking tickets.

08:59.182 --> 09:01.173
<i>One at the mus√©e, overtime.</i>

09:01.250 --> 09:06.449
And one, you'll recall, to you,
in violation of the bent-license-plate law.

09:06.522 --> 09:09.082
- Yes, I recall.
- It's all there in the report.

09:09.158 --> 09:12.025
Fascinating.
Well, I shall waste no time in reading it.

09:12.095 --> 09:16.555
And just in case, I've deftly cataloged,
numbered and cross-referenced

09:16.632 --> 09:19.465
each offense here in my little black book.

09:19.535 --> 09:25.167
Now, Clouseau, you remember when I first
put you on that parking ticket detail...

09:25.241 --> 09:28.176
Yes, you explained
it was a top level assignment.

09:28.244 --> 09:32.908
And that if anyone ever asked you
if I was the one who had assigned you

09:32.982 --> 09:36.679
to this incredibly important mission,
you would deny it.

09:36.753 --> 09:42.350
Chief Inspector, I don't even know
what you are talking about.

09:43.559 --> 09:45.026
Good work, Clouseau.

09:45.094 --> 09:51.158
Now, to business.
I have been instructed to reassign you...

09:54.137 --> 09:55.434
Clouseau?

09:58.775 --> 10:00.106
Clouseau.

10:13.389 --> 10:15.323
We were being recorded.

10:19.462 --> 10:23.330
- The Black Berets.
- The password. What is the password?

10:23.399 --> 10:25.663
- I don't know.
- Four, three...

10:25.735 --> 10:28.169
- We weren't yet told.
...two, one.

10:29.071 --> 10:30.936
Hamburger.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.339
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

10:38.147 --> 10:41.480
- The password was "hamburger"?
- No, "hamburger."

10:41.551 --> 10:44.987
- I said "hamburger".
- No, you said "hamburger."

10:45.054 --> 10:47.045
- Hamburger?
- Hamburger.

10:48.224 --> 10:50.988
How did you know
that we were being recorded?

10:51.060 --> 10:52.721
Easy, Inspector.

10:52.795 --> 10:56.856
This pen emits a small beeping noise
whenever it detects microwaves.

10:56.933 --> 10:59.527
- RadioShack. $12.
- What?

10:59.602 --> 11:04.767
- How did you know the password?
- This little LED chip decodes passwords.

11:04.841 --> 11:08.299
I had it attached to the back
of my Medal of Honor.

11:08.377 --> 11:12.370
- RadioShack?
- EBay. I got this there, too.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.719
- What do you think this is?
- A tape recorder?

11:18.554 --> 11:23.355
No. It only looks like a tape-recorder.
It's actually a pen.

11:26.896 --> 11:29.387
So you can write with it
and no one will know.

11:29.465 --> 11:30.955
Bingo!

11:31.033 --> 11:34.491
Now, you were saying, Inspector.

11:35.137 --> 11:38.231
- You are being reassigned.
- Let me read your mind.

11:38.307 --> 11:41.765
The Tornado is at large, and you want me
to protect the Pink Panther.

11:41.844 --> 11:42.902
- No.
- No?

11:42.979 --> 11:45.072
It is my job to protect the Pink Panther.

11:45.147 --> 11:48.275
You've merely been reassigned
to the Dream Team.

11:50.453 --> 11:52.250
That is quite an honor,

11:52.321 --> 11:54.846
- but I cannot accept.
- What?

11:54.924 --> 11:56.824
If Inspector Clouseau
were to leave France,

11:56.893 --> 11:59.157
the Tornado would surely strike
at the Pink Panther.

11:59.228 --> 12:01.287
- I'm guarding it!
- But...

12:01.364 --> 12:04.026
Don't argue.
You fly to Kyoto in the morning.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.692
But I can't fly.

12:06.702 --> 12:08.863
In a plane!

12:08.938 --> 12:11.168
- But still...
- That's an order.

12:18.981 --> 12:20.175
Nicole.

12:25.154 --> 12:26.781
You are traveling?

12:26.856 --> 12:31.384
Yes, Inspector Dreyfus is sending me
on a very dangerous mission.

12:31.460 --> 12:35.726
- For how long? When will you return?
- I will return when the criminal is caught.

12:35.798 --> 12:39.757
It could be a month, it could be a year.
You understand, Nicole.

12:40.202 --> 12:44.161
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Of course, we will have to stay apart.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.506
If the criminal were to, say, kidnap you,
he would have power over me.

12:49.378 --> 12:51.812
Why would he have power over you?

12:53.316 --> 12:58.276
Well, because, well,

12:59.622 --> 13:01.817
you are like a brother to me.

13:04.193 --> 13:06.923
A hot, sexy brother in a dress.

13:08.598 --> 13:13.262
Nicole, I hope you have forgiven me
for that one evening.

13:13.336 --> 13:15.861
Yes, Inspector, it is forgotten.

13:15.938 --> 13:18.702
- I have not forgotten.
- Neither have I.

13:25.681 --> 13:30.015
So, even though, technically,
we are on duty,

13:30.086 --> 13:33.920
do you think it would be all right
to share a bottle of wine?

13:33.990 --> 13:36.083
I think it would be all right.

13:36.158 --> 13:39.753
Then I will select the wine.
It is one of my specialties.

13:43.933 --> 13:46.766
I would like to select my own wine.

13:46.836 --> 13:50.294
And by the way,
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

13:50.373 --> 13:52.170
Remember this face.

14:52.735 --> 14:56.102
- This is a very special bottle.
- Delicious.

15:08.751 --> 15:11.185
<i>There was something about
burning down a restaurant</i>

15:11.253 --> 15:15.121
<i>that ignited other, more illicit, fires.</i>

15:18.828 --> 15:23.822
- And I'm sorry about that.
- As am I. Terribly remorseful.

15:23.899 --> 15:27.391
It was a night to remember
that we must forget.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.700
We must never forget to not remember it.

15:29.772 --> 15:33.333
And if we do remember it,
we must immediately forget it.

15:34.376 --> 15:37.573
Now, let's have
a professional hug goodbye.

15:43.219 --> 15:46.882
I'll be right there.
I'll see you in several months.

15:46.956 --> 15:51.222
- No problem.
- And I do hope your hearing improves.

15:58.467 --> 16:01.732
Ponton,
I'm worried about my leaving France.

16:01.804 --> 16:05.433
The Tornado is rampant.
The Pink Panther is such a temptation,

16:05.508 --> 16:07.874
and no Clouseau to protect it.

16:07.943 --> 16:11.709
But you visited the museum yourself,
you checked the security.

16:11.781 --> 16:15.342
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

16:16.185 --> 16:19.882
- Are you driving?
- I like to stay in practice.

16:27.596 --> 16:29.826
- Okay.
- Remind me where the brakes are.

16:29.899 --> 16:31.491
- Here. Yes.
- There?

16:31.567 --> 16:33.398
- Yes.
- And then you turn here.

16:33.469 --> 16:34.561
- Of course, yes.
- All right.

16:34.637 --> 16:35.695
- And this turns it.
- Yeah.

16:35.771 --> 16:37.398
Okay, here we go.

16:42.344 --> 16:43.743
- Ponton.
- Yes?

16:43.813 --> 16:47.772
- This case is very strange.
- How so, Inspector?

16:47.850 --> 16:50.341
For 10 years,
the Tornado terrorized Europe,

16:50.419 --> 16:53.911
stealing over a quarter of a billion dollars
worth of artifacts.

16:53.989 --> 16:56.685
Then, for no reason, he suddenly stops.

16:57.493 --> 16:59.927
Maybe the Tornado thought
he had enough money.

16:59.995 --> 17:04.762
If he had enough money, then why,
after 10 years of complete inactivity,

17:04.834 --> 17:07.301
does he suddenly spring back into action?

17:07.368 --> 17:10.736
London, the Magna Carta.
Italy, the sacred Shroud.

17:12.641 --> 17:17.907
The Imperial Sword. Why now?
Why all of a sudden? Why? Why?

17:26.021 --> 17:27.921
You need to calm down.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.126
Hey!

17:47.042 --> 17:51.069
What's the matter, Ponton?
You seem a little depressed today.

17:52.047 --> 17:54.641
- Is it your wife again?
- Yes.

17:55.484 --> 17:58.419
She still feels my job
takes up too much of my time.

17:59.188 --> 18:01.122
The same old thing.

18:01.190 --> 18:05.923
Next week is our 10th anniversary.
She thinks we should go away together.

18:05.995 --> 18:08.793
Ponton, would you like me
to talk with her?

18:08.864 --> 18:09.922
No.

18:10.966 --> 18:14.333
I mean, this issue must be discussed
between husband and wife.

18:14.403 --> 18:18.464
Well, you must explain to her
that we are men of the law.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.735
Always living in the shadows.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.508
Idiot.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.576
I will miss you, Inspector.

18:30.686 --> 18:32.916
I will miss you, too, Ponton.

18:33.856 --> 18:35.687
- And, Ponton.
- Yes?

18:35.758 --> 18:38.454
I am sorry you can't satisfy your wife.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.992
"I am now leaving France."

18:45.768 --> 18:47.531
This is a bad idea.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.367
<i>The legendary Pink Panther Diamond
has been stolen.</i>

18:55.444 --> 18:58.277
<i>Officials suspect the perpetrator
is the infamous Tornado.</i>

18:58.347 --> 19:00.076
What'd I tell you?

19:00.316 --> 19:04.650
<i>The theft of the Pink Panther would be
the fourth high-profile crime...</i>

19:05.421 --> 19:08.413
Oh, my God! He was right.

19:10.059 --> 19:14.587
The Dream Team was supposed to start
its investigations in Kyoto, Japan,

19:14.663 --> 19:17.325
but it's just been diverted to Paris.

19:17.399 --> 19:18.457
France is in shock.

19:18.534 --> 19:22.129
The international Dream Team
of detectives will begin...

19:23.372 --> 19:28.036
I'm standing outside the Grand Palais
where the Pink Panther has been stolen.

19:34.917 --> 19:37.818
Why are they cheering?
This is a national tragedy.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.583
We live in a media age.
You must learn to adapt.

19:41.657 --> 19:43.488
Then adapt I shall.

19:53.035 --> 19:56.937
- Who do you think did this, Inspector?
- Inspector, any comment?

19:58.574 --> 20:01.134
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.

20:02.044 --> 20:03.341
One more.

20:04.480 --> 20:08.473
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.
There's your one.

20:11.754 --> 20:15.850
Good afternoon, Inspector.
The other detectives have already arrived.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.949
They are waiting for you.

20:18.894 --> 20:21.886
- I'm sorry, I don't remember your name.
- What?

20:24.967 --> 20:31.896
- Yes. I am Nicole.
- Yes, so nice to see you again.

20:31.974 --> 20:33.737
You, too, Inspector.

20:34.977 --> 20:38.674
Well, enough of this foreplay.
Where are the other detectives?

20:38.747 --> 20:40.908
Yes, they're waiting inside.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.443
I hope no one has
tampered with the crime scene.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.078
A crime scene is like a code.

20:46.155 --> 20:49.215
You decipher it,
and it will lead inexorably to the criminal.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.818
That is why it must always be kept
in pristine condition.

21:04.006 --> 21:08.136
Good day. I'm Inspector Jacques Clouseau
of the French Police.

21:08.510 --> 21:12.207
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

21:12.281 --> 21:13.771
And your name?

21:15.651 --> 21:18.449
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.854
That is your name. I thought you were
ordering in Italian. Once again.

21:25.427 --> 21:29.693
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

21:32.034 --> 21:33.695
Don Corleone.

21:34.636 --> 21:35.796
I'm Kenji Mazuto.

21:35.871 --> 21:37.600
Kenji Mazel Tov.

21:37.673 --> 21:39.436
Randall Pepperidge.

21:40.843 --> 21:44.677
And this is my associate Gilbert Ponton,
and this is Nicole.

21:44.746 --> 21:46.543
Nicole is here to service your needs,

21:46.615 --> 21:49.550
so feel free to use her
in any way you wish.

21:52.087 --> 21:54.817
And now there is a crime scene waiting.

21:57.192 --> 22:00.252
Excuse me. "El sceno de crimo."

22:02.464 --> 22:08.164
- That is not Italian, and I do speak English.
- Really? Prove it.

22:08.704 --> 22:12.868
Gentlemen, we first have to determine
how the crime was committed.

22:12.941 --> 22:15.808
And as I am an expert at deduction...

22:15.878 --> 22:18.745
- You are an expert at deduction?
- That is my field.

22:18.814 --> 22:24.184
I believe deduction is my field
and since you are experiencing hip pain...

22:24.253 --> 22:25.618
How did you know that?

22:25.687 --> 22:28.281
One side of the sole of your shoe
is worn more than the other.

22:28.357 --> 22:30.689
You're favoring your right leg.

22:30.759 --> 22:34.718
Tell me, did you enjoy
your double espresso this morning?

22:34.796 --> 22:37.287
- How did you...
- Your pupils are noticeably dilated.

22:37.366 --> 22:40.335
And will you be moving out
of the Hotel Montmartre?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.700
They are doing construction at night
around the Montmartre

22:42.771 --> 22:45.103
so as not to disturb daytime traffic.

22:45.174 --> 22:48.940
From your puffy eyes,
I deduce you spent a sleepless night.

22:49.678 --> 22:53.114
Speaking of traffic,
are you enjoying your Smart car?

22:54.016 --> 22:55.916
Your trousers are wrinkled
behind the knees.

22:55.984 --> 23:00.011
And how do you think your favorite
football team, Arsenal, will do this year?

23:00.088 --> 23:02.420
That matchbox is from
the only bar in Paris

23:02.491 --> 23:04.425
that shows English football telecasts.

23:04.493 --> 23:06.620
You have tissues in your shoes
to make you look taller.

23:06.695 --> 23:09.823
You were 14 before you finally
learned to enjoy avocado.

23:09.898 --> 23:13.732
Tell me, how did you enjoy
your trip to the airport this morning?

23:13.802 --> 23:16.430
Now, how did you know that?

23:16.972 --> 23:20.271
- Perhaps one of you should begin.
- Yes, this is silly.

23:20.342 --> 23:21.673
You've recently lost
your favorite cheese grater.

23:21.743 --> 23:23.540
You have an aversion to cow bells.

23:23.612 --> 23:26.137
Stop the insanity and look at this.

23:27.416 --> 23:30.510
IL Tornado is not as careful as he thinks.

23:34.756 --> 23:39.420
Fingerprint. With this small piece of glass,
the case is practically solved.

23:41.363 --> 23:43.490
This one has a fingerprint.

23:45.634 --> 23:48.000
This one has a fingerprint, too.

23:48.070 --> 23:49.970
This one has a fingerprint.

23:50.038 --> 23:53.872
You don't need that.
You have plenty of fingerprint evidence.

23:57.179 --> 23:58.578
Guard that.

24:00.949 --> 24:03.918
What do we know about this man,
this Tornado.

24:05.087 --> 24:08.545
Well, we know that he's a white male
between 50 and 65,

24:08.624 --> 24:11.684
with a scar from a bullet hole
behind his right shoulder.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.754
In 1996, the Tornado was shot right here
in France while trying to steal a gold vase.

24:16.832 --> 24:21.735
Blood was found, and as a result,
his DNA has been on file for over 10 years

24:22.471 --> 24:24.063
without a match.

24:27.242 --> 24:30.541
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
My flight was delayed.

24:30.612 --> 24:33.012
You're Jacques Clouseau.

24:36.251 --> 24:40.119
The Pink Panther detective.
This is such a thrill.

24:41.189 --> 24:44.386
- And who is it that are you?
- I'm Sonia Solandres.

24:44.926 --> 24:49.022
- Didn't anyone tell you that...
- Yes. I was informed.

24:49.097 --> 24:52.032
- A last-minute addition to our team.
- That's right.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.534
I've written a book
on the old Tornado crimes,

24:54.603 --> 24:57.504
but I'm not sure
if I'm really gonna be much help here.

24:57.572 --> 25:00.871
Technically speaking,
I'm not really a detective.

25:00.942 --> 25:03.843
Welcome.
We can always use an extra mind.

25:03.912 --> 25:06.972
Now, let me bring you up to speed.
We know nothing.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.448
You are now up to speed.

25:14.923 --> 25:16.550
<i>In world news today,</i>

25:16.625 --> 25:21.153
<i>members of the Dream Team gathered for
the first time in front of the Grand Palais</i>

25:21.229 --> 25:24.630
<i>to start their investigations
into the Tornado thefts.</i>

25:24.700 --> 25:27.669
<i>Inspector Clouseau had this to say.</i>

25:27.736 --> 25:31.900
<i>Tornado, I'm coming to get you.
There's your one.</i>

25:35.477 --> 25:38.310
I was able to discover this Tornado
hacked the security system

25:38.380 --> 25:42.783
from a remote location and turned off
all the alarms and surveillance scanners.

25:42.851 --> 25:46.343
- Can you trace the source?
- Yes, but it will take time.

25:48.724 --> 25:52.660
- You are new here?
- Yes, hello. Mrs. Berenger.

25:52.728 --> 25:55.390
- I know who you are, Inspector.
- Do you?

25:55.464 --> 25:58.331
Due to the media frenzy
surrounding this case,

25:58.400 --> 26:03.099
I've been assigned to instruct employees
on political and social correctness.

26:03.638 --> 26:06.471
It's always nice
to have a very sexy woman

26:06.541 --> 26:09.408
clomping around the building
in high heels.

26:12.681 --> 26:17.983
- You must never refer to a woman as sexy.
- But I was complimenting you.

26:18.053 --> 26:21.989
No, Inspector, you must not comment
on a woman's body.

26:23.058 --> 26:27.256
- I get it. I get it. I keep it to myself...
- Yes.

26:27.329 --> 26:31.823
...when I am thinking...
- Inspector.

26:34.002 --> 26:37.267
This will be an exercise
and I want you to concentrate.

26:37.339 --> 26:41.867
And no matter what I say,
I want your expression to remain neutral.

26:41.943 --> 26:43.672
That will be easy.

26:44.179 --> 26:46.306
You're here in the corridor
at your employment,

26:46.381 --> 26:49.441
and you see a very pretty young woman
walking toward you,

26:49.518 --> 26:53.477
and her blouse is tight
and is rather bursting at the buttons,

26:53.555 --> 26:55.045
and she drops her pencil,

26:55.123 --> 26:58.490
and as she bends to retrieve it,
her blouse parts,

26:58.560 --> 27:02.291
revealing the cleavage
of her soft, round, white mounds.

27:02.364 --> 27:05.629
And then the pencil rolls around
and she bends again,

27:05.700 --> 27:09.158
and her undulating buttocks
cause the short skirt to rise

27:09.237 --> 27:12.138
just shy of the nooks and crannies.

27:16.411 --> 27:21.371
I like you, Mrs. Berenger. I like you a lot.

27:21.950 --> 27:25.215
So, I have made lunch reservations
at four different restaurants,

27:25.287 --> 27:28.313
depending on who wants to eat where.

27:28.390 --> 27:33.384
You know,
I cannot decide what is more beautiful.

27:34.162 --> 27:36.426
Paris or you.

27:44.306 --> 27:46.797
May I have a word in private?

27:48.977 --> 27:55.280
I'm worried that your hot Italian blood
might be leading you into an indiscretion.

27:55.750 --> 27:56.774
Really?

27:56.852 --> 28:01.585
Yes, these attentions
you're paying to Nicole.

28:01.656 --> 28:02.748
What?

28:05.327 --> 28:07.693
I see. You and she, you like the...

28:07.762 --> 28:11.163
Oh, no, no, no.
She and I are co-workers, nothing more.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.700
So I'm not stepping on toes.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.930
How could you, since she and I have
absolutely no feelings for one another.

28:16.004 --> 28:19.804
Good, because I find her very alluring.

28:19.875 --> 28:25.313
No. No. For a man like you, she's too drab.

28:25.914 --> 28:30.476
- Drab?
- And she is disgusting.

28:30.552 --> 28:33.316
- Disgusting?
- Yeah, she's drab and disgusting.

28:33.388 --> 28:34.980
I think you are wrong, Clouseau.

28:35.056 --> 28:38.355
You see, you and I,
we are men of the world, no?

28:38.426 --> 28:41.725
We've had all these
sexy and glamorous women, right?

28:42.998 --> 28:46.661
Yes, in fact, I believe
you've made a conquest of your own

28:48.036 --> 28:49.731
in Miss Solandres.

28:55.510 --> 28:57.535
Clouseau, you are a lover.

28:58.413 --> 29:03.112
And Nicole is a woman for a lifetime,
a woman to have the babies with.

29:03.184 --> 29:06.642
- To have the babies?
- Yes, lots and lots of the babies.

29:07.889 --> 29:09.948
All day long the babies.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.019
All day long the babies?

29:15.330 --> 29:16.592
Ponton.

29:18.166 --> 29:21.101
That Italian and I have locked antlers.

29:21.169 --> 29:24.627
We are like two angry stags
pawing at the ground.

29:24.706 --> 29:26.298
Have we decided on lunch?

29:26.374 --> 29:30.538
Well, I suppose you will be wanting sushi,
my little yellow friend?

29:33.348 --> 29:34.406
What?

29:35.917 --> 29:41.514
Inspector, we never refer to Japanese
people as "our little yellow friends."

29:41.590 --> 29:44.525
- But why?
- Because it is a stereotype.

29:45.727 --> 29:48.287
Inspector, are you prejudiced
against Asians?

29:48.363 --> 29:51.594
Well, of course not.
Except when they drive.

29:51.666 --> 29:52.928
Have you ever seen them drive?

29:53.001 --> 29:55.128
They can hardly see over
the steering wheel.

29:55.203 --> 29:58.661
- Inspector.
- Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Berenger.

29:58.740 --> 30:02.574
I suppose I'm a bit of a dumb blonde
about this.

30:02.644 --> 30:06.273
- What?
- You must never refer to blondes that way.

30:06.348 --> 30:09.010
- But they are so dumb.
- Oh, my God.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.288
Were you just ogling her?

30:15.357 --> 30:17.587
- No.
- Yes, you were.

30:17.659 --> 30:19.752
I did not.

30:19.828 --> 30:22.058
- You did.
- I did not.

30:22.731 --> 30:24.562
- You did it again.
- No, I didn't.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.260
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
- I did not.

30:26.334 --> 30:28.495
- No, you didn't.
- You did it.

30:30.505 --> 30:31.904
- You did it again!
- No, I didn't.

30:31.973 --> 30:32.997
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.

30:33.074 --> 30:35.008
- Yes, you did.
- Oh, my God, look!

30:35.076 --> 30:36.600
Oh, my God...

30:51.359 --> 30:52.621
Ponton?

30:52.994 --> 30:55.394
I had it out with my wife.

30:55.463 --> 30:58.523
I told her that she must not
question me about my work,

30:58.600 --> 31:02.661
and that my home life must take
second place to my career.

31:02.737 --> 31:07.174
Good for you. Congratulations!
You are now a real man.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.437
So, then, can I stay here with you?

31:09.511 --> 31:12.412
- What?
- May I stay here? I got kicked out.

31:13.715 --> 31:18.482
- Yes, I suppose. Temporarily.
- Thank you.

31:18.553 --> 31:20.145
It's okay, boys.

31:22.957 --> 31:24.481
What are these?

31:26.795 --> 31:27.784
Ponton?

31:27.862 --> 31:32.390
They are my sons, Louis and Antoine.
They took my side of the argument.

31:32.467 --> 31:33.957
And this is Jacques.

31:34.035 --> 31:36.970
They named him after you.
They idolize you.

31:44.379 --> 31:46.711
Uncle Jacques, what's that?

31:48.550 --> 31:52.077
That is an award given to me
by the President of France.

31:53.254 --> 31:54.516
Go ahead.

31:57.092 --> 32:00.892
- Is that the Pink Panther?
- No, it's a replica.

32:00.962 --> 32:04.363
A copy given to me
for recovering the real diamond

32:04.432 --> 32:06.195
and returning it to France.

32:06.267 --> 32:08.895
Let's show Uncle Jacques what we won.

32:10.505 --> 32:13.770
We won these in a competition
in karate school.

32:13.842 --> 32:15.901
That is so cute.

32:18.446 --> 32:21.040
Now, let me show you a real trophy.

32:23.585 --> 32:26.816
One I won at a karate competition
just recently.

32:28.189 --> 32:29.781
Wow!

32:29.858 --> 32:32.088
- You like karate?
- We love it.

32:32.927 --> 32:34.360
Remember, boys.

32:34.429 --> 32:40.925
The secret to a successful karate attack
is the element of surprise.

32:49.744 --> 32:51.541
- Good one.
- Thank you.

32:55.617 --> 32:59.747
To find the Tornado,
we must consider his motives.

32:59.821 --> 33:03.689
I'm worried that right now,
the thief is trying to sell the goods.

33:03.758 --> 33:05.055
Right.

33:05.126 --> 33:08.254
"Hey, buddy, do you want to buy
the Shroud of Turin?"

33:08.329 --> 33:11.992
No. These items are too famous to be sold.

33:12.066 --> 33:16.127
Only the Pink Panther can be cut up
and sold as smaller gems.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.729
I suspect that's what he wants.

33:18.807 --> 33:20.468
I have something.

33:22.043 --> 33:28.141
This says the computer that hacked into
the museum is located in Rome.

33:28.516 --> 33:31.679
- Rome?
- Yes. Is something wrong?

33:32.554 --> 33:35.682
No. No. Rome means nothing to me.

33:37.859 --> 33:39.292
I mean...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.594
Rome? Do you know who lives in Rome?

33:48.670 --> 33:51.901
- Alonso Avellaneda!
- The black market art dealer.

33:51.973 --> 33:54.771
The man rumored to be
the Tornado's fence.

34:13.228 --> 34:14.422
There's always been a suspicion

34:14.495 --> 34:18.022
that Avellaneda's not just the Tornado's
fence, but the Tornado himself.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.225
He is the right age.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.530
Do we have a sample of his DNA?

34:21.603 --> 34:25.061
Not yet, but we should be in Rome
in one hour.

34:25.139 --> 34:27.004
Where is our pilot?

34:27.074 --> 34:30.533
I don't trust any other pilot
for my plane but myself.

34:31.411 --> 34:32.844
Your plane.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.882
Nicoletta,
would you like to be my co-pilot?

34:40.588 --> 34:42.748
- Come.
- Okay.

34:55.937 --> 35:00.306
- Would I be disturbing you if I joined you?
- No, no. Please disturb me.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.181
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said outside the museum,

35:08.249 --> 35:10.911
about the psychology of the criminal.

35:11.719 --> 35:13.084
The "why?"

35:15.089 --> 35:18.354
Perhaps romantic disappointment.

35:19.127 --> 35:24.190
A foolish young woman
who leaves a man for a younger man.

35:25.566 --> 35:27.557
That could never happen.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.731
But of course.

35:29.804 --> 35:31.863
What a man such as that should do

35:31.940 --> 35:37.037
is start a new romance
with someone more appreciative.

35:43.184 --> 35:47.553
That is so funny. "Start a new romance."

35:48.089 --> 35:52.116
I'm not quite sure what you mean,
but that is funny.

35:57.065 --> 36:01.934
It appears that Inspector Clouseau
does not find Miss Solandres drab.

36:06.674 --> 36:07.698
"Drab"?

36:07.775 --> 36:10.676
The very word
that he used to describe you.

36:11.479 --> 36:14.039
- He called me drab?
- And disgusting.

36:15.183 --> 36:16.548
Disgusting?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.551
Thank you.

36:35.937 --> 36:38.872
Hey, Ponton.
Tell me more about Inspector Clouseau.

36:38.940 --> 36:42.637
He's a brilliant man, unorthodox, oblique.

36:43.311 --> 36:45.404
But I can tell you
with absolute confidence,

36:45.480 --> 36:48.176
he's the man who will solve this case.

36:48.249 --> 36:51.013
Ponton-san, you are crazy.

36:53.521 --> 36:56.354
If Clouseau solves this case,
I am perfectly willing to run around

36:56.424 --> 36:59.723
like a bare-bummed idiot
wearing nothing but a tutu.

37:01.963 --> 37:04.090
Well, let's talk about Avellaneda.

37:04.165 --> 37:07.828
- What are his proclivities?
- He's an art connoisseur,

37:07.902 --> 37:09.529
but because of his questionable dealings,

37:09.604 --> 37:12.334
he was thrown out of Spain
and must live here.

37:12.407 --> 37:15.638
You see?
He has squandered his reputation,

37:15.710 --> 37:18.474
and he is forced to live in the woods
like an animal

37:18.546 --> 37:20.605
with the shame of being a criminal.

37:20.681 --> 37:25.482
If there is one absolute truth in this world,
it is that crime does not pay.

37:35.430 --> 37:37.955
You say the bullet hole is
behind his right shoulder?

37:38.032 --> 37:39.056
Yes.

37:39.133 --> 37:43.661
Then all we have to do is figure out a way
to get him to remove his shirt.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.539
I was half expecting you.

37:55.249 --> 37:57.615
Are you the so-called "Dream Team"?

37:57.685 --> 38:00.449
And who is it
who is inquiring of us who we are?

38:00.521 --> 38:05.185
I am Alonso Avellaneda.
Is this more of that Tornado nonsense?

38:05.259 --> 38:08.285
We shall see who is the one
who will be saying nonsensical things

38:08.362 --> 38:10.694
that are something of nonsense.

38:15.603 --> 38:19.596
Well, I suppose I must bow
to the inevitable.

38:19.674 --> 38:22.768
Please, come inside.
I'll join you in a moment.

38:33.387 --> 38:34.786
Nicole.

38:34.856 --> 38:39.953
While the Dream Team plays its
little games, I am going to snoop around.

38:45.266 --> 38:46.665
Who cares?

38:50.271 --> 38:55.641
So, gentlemen and ladies,
please make yourselves at home.

38:56.878 --> 38:58.743
Now, how can I help you?

38:58.813 --> 39:02.579
<i>Se√±or Avellaneda,
where were you last Friday evening?</i>

39:02.650 --> 39:05.346
Dining with my daughter and my ex-wife.

39:06.687 --> 39:08.154
Don't believe me, call them.

39:08.222 --> 39:09.780
Why call them?

39:09.857 --> 39:13.725
They already lied for you
on the stand 10 years ago.

39:13.794 --> 39:15.659
I am not the Tornado.

39:15.730 --> 39:18.426
Do you mind
if I examine your computer system?

39:18.499 --> 39:20.626
Be my guest. I have nothing to hide.

39:20.701 --> 39:23.363
Sometimes things hide in plain sight.

39:28.876 --> 39:30.639
My security system.

39:43.191 --> 39:45.216
Answer this question.

39:45.293 --> 39:49.059
In the past, you admitted to dealings
with IL Tornado?

39:49.130 --> 39:51.621
Yes, but that was 10 years ago.

39:51.699 --> 39:54.930
Besides, I never saw his face.

39:55.002 --> 39:58.301
How did you conduct these transactions
if you never saw his face?

39:58.372 --> 40:02.035
He was in disguise.
He always wore a mask.

40:02.109 --> 40:05.101
Did you call him Zorro?
Or the Power Ranger?

40:05.179 --> 40:07.704
<i>Come, come, se√±or Avellaneda,
you expect us to believe</i>

40:07.782 --> 40:10.580
that two grown men
do millions of dollars of business

40:10.651 --> 40:12.551
with each other
and you never saw his face?

40:12.620 --> 40:14.212
Perhaps I saw him once.

40:14.288 --> 40:17.883
Did it look something like this?
Or this? How about this?

40:17.959 --> 40:21.827
No, I've told you. I am not the Tornado.

40:21.896 --> 40:23.693
How did you pay him?

40:24.532 --> 40:27.433
With deposits into Swiss bank accounts.

40:27.501 --> 40:29.833
Numbered. Untraceable.

40:31.706 --> 40:33.606
I understand.

40:33.674 --> 40:37.872
Look, I know my answers
are less than satisfactory.

40:38.980 --> 40:40.948
I realize that.

40:41.015 --> 40:43.381
Does this mean
I must spend the rest of my life

40:43.451 --> 40:45.146
living under a cloud of suspicion?

40:45.219 --> 40:47.847
- Forgive my intrusion.
- Yes.

40:47.922 --> 40:50.516
There is one way to prove your innocence.

40:50.591 --> 40:52.582
Back in 1996, while perpetrating a crime...

40:52.660 --> 40:56.289
Yes, yes, yes. He received a bullet wound
in the shoulder.

40:58.299 --> 41:00.358
Is this what it's come to?

41:01.602 --> 41:05.265
That I must strip down
and remove my clothes

41:05.339 --> 41:07.500
in the sanctity of my own home

41:07.575 --> 41:12.012
before a group of people I've only just met
just to prove my innocence?

41:12.079 --> 41:13.979
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

41:15.549 --> 41:18.109
Fine. Let's get it over with, then.

41:30.431 --> 41:32.956
I believe it was the right shoulder.

41:41.642 --> 41:46.670
So I hope this proves beyond doubt
that I am not the Tornado.

41:46.747 --> 41:49.272
We will have to leave you in peace.

42:16.143 --> 42:19.601
He's already shown us his shoulders.
There is no wound.

42:21.382 --> 42:22.679
He did?

42:25.820 --> 42:28.254
- The man is guilty.
- There's no physical evidence.

42:28.322 --> 42:29.482
Clouseau!

42:29.557 --> 42:32.720
He removed his shirt twice,
and there was no bullet hole.

42:32.793 --> 42:35.694
Haven't you ever heard
of cosmetic surgery?

42:38.099 --> 42:40.624
Yes. Of course you have.

42:46.607 --> 42:50.805
Clouseau Inspector,
I even checked all the house's computers.

42:50.878 --> 42:53.176
None of them are used
to hack into the museum.

42:53.247 --> 42:54.509
Still...

42:55.116 --> 42:58.347
Clouseau, can't you see
what's plain in front of you?

42:58.419 --> 43:01.115
Your unrelenting stubbornness
is maddening.

43:01.188 --> 43:05.955
And I'm telling you I sense
the presence of the Tornado in that house.

43:14.935 --> 43:16.926
They don't know anything.

43:18.205 --> 43:21.333
That blasted bullet wound. It's my mark.

43:23.778 --> 43:25.678
One day they'll find me.

43:25.746 --> 43:27.839
You're in no danger, Laurence.

43:27.915 --> 43:29.940
This is all very strange.

43:31.185 --> 43:33.176
I even know one of them.

43:33.854 --> 43:35.082
You do?

43:36.757 --> 43:38.748
- Which one?
- You know me.

43:40.461 --> 43:42.156
Isn't it obvious?

43:48.569 --> 43:50.503
Inspector, excuse me.

43:50.571 --> 43:55.565
Are you familiar with a Spanish restaurant
here in Rome called La Plata de Nada?

43:55.643 --> 43:57.838
Know it? I destroyed it.

43:57.912 --> 44:01.848
I found this in a jammed paper shredder.

44:02.349 --> 44:06.080
8:00 tonight.
The grand re-opening of La Plata de Nada.

44:06.153 --> 44:08.144
And I thought, "Why would Avellaneda

44:08.222 --> 44:11.919
"shred a simple reminder
of a dinner appointment?"

44:11.992 --> 44:13.823
Good work, Ponton.

44:14.762 --> 44:17.993
- So what should we do?
- Our jobs, Ponton.

44:18.065 --> 44:23.128
We investigate, see who he's eating with.
Perhaps the Tornado.

44:24.271 --> 44:25.363
You go on ahead.

44:25.439 --> 44:29.569
Ponton and I will get a taxi
and do a little sightseeing.

44:38.219 --> 44:43.919
This stakeout was a good idea, Ponton.
Fortunately, I'm an expert lip-reader.

44:43.991 --> 44:50.123
He's saying, "Never retune a wet piano."

44:50.197 --> 44:51.221
Why is he saying that?

44:51.298 --> 44:54.825
No, he is saying, "My wife will not be back
in Italy until Sunday."

44:54.902 --> 44:58.668
- No wonder he shredded the message.
- What is all this?

44:58.739 --> 45:00.934
Before they opened tonight, I snuck in,

45:01.008 --> 45:04.409
found out which table he'd reserved,
and planted a bug.

45:04.478 --> 45:08.278
But how did you find out which table
they would be seated at?

45:09.850 --> 45:12.318
You rubbed your fingers together.

45:12.887 --> 45:14.616
That is surprising.

45:19.226 --> 45:21.820
What is she doing here with him?

45:24.832 --> 45:26.663
I'm sorry, Inspector.

45:27.167 --> 45:28.964
We've got to find out
what they are saying.

45:29.036 --> 45:30.469
Why?

45:30.538 --> 45:33.996
We've got to move the bug
from that table to that table.

45:34.074 --> 45:37.202
- How?
- Let me handle it.

45:42.283 --> 45:44.615
Hello. Remember me?

45:48.923 --> 45:50.720
Don't you come back.

46:18.285 --> 46:20.651
What's wrong?
You don't like this restaurant?

46:20.721 --> 46:23.849
Oh, no.
No, I have been here one time before.

46:23.924 --> 46:25.482
It's very nice.

48:48.202 --> 48:50.568
There. It is out.

49:50.063 --> 49:53.760
<i>We've been able to confirm
that the Pope's ring has been stolen.</i>

49:53.834 --> 49:58.237
<i>Ironically, the Dream Team
was no less than five miles away in Rome.</i>

49:58.305 --> 50:02.674
<i>The Italian people are outraged
that the Tornado was able to pull this off</i>

50:02.743 --> 50:04.574
<i>right under their noses.</i>

50:14.955 --> 50:16.013
Mr. Clouseau.

50:16.089 --> 50:18.819
Mr. Pepperidge, was the Dream Team
sleeping last night during the theft?

50:18.892 --> 50:19.881
No comment.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.520
Do you think
they will ever recover the ring?

50:22.596 --> 50:24.962
If I made a comment after I'd said,
"No comment,"

50:25.032 --> 50:27.523
I'd look like a complete ass, wouldn't I?

51:04.137 --> 51:07.334
Do not worry.
Vicenzo Roccara Squarcialupi Brancaleone

51:07.407 --> 51:09.170
swears to you by all that is holy,

51:09.243 --> 51:12.735
that St. Peter's ring
will be restored to the Church.

51:12.813 --> 51:14.940
Please sit down.

51:17.017 --> 51:18.416
Now, Mr. Pope,

51:18.485 --> 51:22.216
do you happen to know right now
the whereabouts of your hat?

51:24.224 --> 51:27.284
- My hat?
- Yes, your big, pointy hat.

51:27.361 --> 51:28.988
No, I don't know.

51:30.364 --> 51:35.631
Then I am probably sitting on it.
I thought I felt a little...

51:41.441 --> 51:43.136
This can be fixed.

51:46.146 --> 51:47.670
As good as new.

51:48.615 --> 51:49.809
Now...

51:52.786 --> 51:54.754
How do we know
it wasn't you who stole the ring

51:54.821 --> 51:57.654
so you could collect
on the insurance money?

51:57.724 --> 52:01.091
- I am the Pope.
- Forgive me, Mr. Pope,

52:02.229 --> 52:04.789
it's just that sometimes
when I speak so forcefully,

52:04.865 --> 52:09.359
people just crack instantly.
Now, was the ring insured?

52:09.970 --> 52:12.302
The ring is priceless. It cannot be insured.

52:12.372 --> 52:15.830
- So you had no reason to steal the ring.
- I own the ring.

52:15.909 --> 52:20.608
Perhaps you wanted to sell the ring
so you could live in a big, fancy house.

52:21.248 --> 52:22.772
I kind of do.

52:25.953 --> 52:30.947
Now, let me reconstruct the crime.
You came into the room when?

52:31.024 --> 52:33.549
- At 9:00.
- And what was the first thing you did?

52:33.627 --> 52:37.461
I went out on the balcony
to admire the Lord's handiwork.

52:37.531 --> 52:42.161
The moon that night was so beautiful.
It made me close to the Lord.

52:42.235 --> 52:47.366
I'm picking up on something.
You're a very spiritual man, aren't you?

52:48.408 --> 52:53.311
It's part of my job to read people.
I think I'm quite good at it, too.

52:54.948 --> 52:57.508
- And then what did you do?
- I removed my robes.

52:57.584 --> 52:59.882
- And you put them...
- In the closet.

52:59.953 --> 53:01.648
- May I?
- Certainly.

53:05.325 --> 53:07.452
You know,
if you organized your closets by color,

53:07.527 --> 53:09.995
it would save you time
in your rush to get to work in the morning.

53:10.063 --> 53:12.657
It's what I do, and it saves me time.

53:12.733 --> 53:14.826
Now, in order to better
visualize the crime,

53:14.901 --> 53:18.200
I'm going to place myself in your position.

53:18.271 --> 53:20.705
- With your permission.
- Certainly.

53:38.759 --> 53:44.163
So, I come home, it's 9:00 p.m.
"I think I'll go look at the moon."

53:44.231 --> 53:47.598
I am going out onto the balcony.

53:50.270 --> 53:54.070
I walk out on the balcony.
I am now out on the balcony.

54:04.251 --> 54:08.415
I am looking at the moon.
I am looking at the moon.

54:08.488 --> 54:12.925
I'm feeling very, very spiritual.
I come back in.

54:15.595 --> 54:18.655
- And what did you do next?
- I went out for the second time.

54:18.732 --> 54:21.860
You went out a second time
to look at the moon.

54:24.204 --> 54:25.796
It's the Pope.

54:27.607 --> 54:31.441
Looking at the moon,
18 seconds has gone by.

54:34.247 --> 54:38.149
18 seconds is enough time
for the thief to have gained entrance.

54:38.218 --> 54:41.551
Now, you see why it is important
to re-create the events.

54:41.621 --> 54:46.115
Or perhaps the thief was hiding
in a ledge or recess.

54:46.193 --> 54:50.323
Or perhaps he was clinging
to the underside of the...

55:14.421 --> 55:17.413
Thank you, God. Thank you.

55:17.491 --> 55:20.551
Chief Inspector,
Joubert wants to speak to you.

55:20.861 --> 55:22.556
He wants Clouseau off the case.

55:22.629 --> 55:24.062
- No!
- No?

55:24.131 --> 55:27.532
No, let's wait till he does
something really embarrassing.

55:55.162 --> 55:56.356
Home.

56:00.667 --> 56:02.362
- Surprise attack!
- Surprise attack!

56:02.435 --> 56:05.962
- Not now, I'm depressed.
- Perfect for our advantage.

56:08.909 --> 56:13.471
The secret to an attack
is the element of surprise, remember?

56:40.774 --> 56:44.676
Now I will teach you
who is the karate master.

56:56.156 --> 56:58.886
Now watch what I will do to your head.

56:58.959 --> 57:00.551
Now, Antoine.

57:11.871 --> 57:14.169
Let's talk about this, boys.

57:46.673 --> 57:51.201
Come, little ones. All is forgiven.

57:55.982 --> 57:58.314
Ponton, can we see Clouseau?

57:58.385 --> 57:59.943
Is the French idiot home?

58:00.020 --> 58:01.920
How does he feel about his disgrace?

58:01.988 --> 58:04.821
Inspector Clouseau
is the consummate professional.

58:04.891 --> 58:07.621
He always exhibits grace under pressure.

58:09.496 --> 58:11.623
Die, little piglets!

58:21.107 --> 58:25.441
My God, do you understand
what you have done that is wrong?

58:25.512 --> 58:27.946
- Just remind me.
- You cannot beat up children

58:28.014 --> 58:32.542
- and call them piglets.
- The world is changing so fast.

58:32.619 --> 58:36.180
Inspector, you have failed to improve
at every opportunity.

58:36.256 --> 58:40.488
You are the most small-minded nitwit
I have ever encountered.

58:40.560 --> 58:45.361
- I am sure I can do better.
- Very well, we'll give you one more try.

58:46.166 --> 58:50.466
I'm going to hold up a series of images,
and I want you to tell me what you see.

58:50.537 --> 58:53.836
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

58:53.907 --> 58:55.670
A drunken Irishman.

58:56.443 --> 58:58.638
An Englishman with bad teeth.

58:59.279 --> 59:01.543
A San Francisco Nancy boy.

59:02.482 --> 59:05.542
A Polish army officer driving a septic tank.

59:05.618 --> 59:07.950
Where did you get these cards?

59:09.422 --> 59:13.449
It's in every newspaper all over the world.
We're all being made to look like idiots.

59:13.526 --> 59:16.359
Reputations built up over a lifetime
utterly ruined.

59:16.429 --> 59:19.592
I had to quit being a Buddhist
because I feel so much hate.

59:19.666 --> 59:21.531
He sat on the Pope's hat!

59:21.601 --> 59:25.935
Look, he recovered the Pink Panther once,
and I believe he can do it again.

59:26.005 --> 59:29.463
If he solves this case, I'm perfectly willing
to run around for 24 hours

59:29.542 --> 59:34.241
wearing nothing but a tutu
and carrying a big, pink, fluffy handbag.

59:34.314 --> 59:37.715
I say we take a vote to get rid of him.
All in favor?

59:41.354 --> 59:44.221
Whatever it is, count me in.

59:45.024 --> 59:49.188
Clouseau, while you were
falling off of the Pope's balcony

59:49.262 --> 59:53.392
dressed as the Pope,
I discovered a key piece of evidence.

59:53.466 --> 59:56.401
And what is this key piece of evidence?

59:57.637 --> 59:58.797
A key.

59:58.872 --> 01:00:02.933
I found this on the Pope's bedroom floor.
Something, of course, you overlooked.

01:00:03.009 --> 01:00:04.567
That could mean anything.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:08.944
But if this key is so important,
I will take it and duly examine it.

01:00:09.015 --> 01:00:10.880
Inspector Clouseau.

01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:18.558
It is my not-so-sad duty to inform you
that you have been voted off of the team.

01:00:21.027 --> 01:00:22.255
Off the team?

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:25.297
You are no longer part
of this investigation.

01:00:28.802 --> 01:00:30.030
Cheerio.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:41.040
Nicole.

01:00:43.983 --> 01:00:45.917
- Nicole?
- Inspector.

01:00:48.121 --> 01:00:50.282
I was just returning a file.

01:00:51.658 --> 01:00:55.094
What are you doing in Nicole's office?

01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:58.562
- When I got fired...
- You thought Nicole was the one person

01:00:58.631 --> 01:01:02.829
- you could share it with.
- Well, we do go back.

01:01:05.205 --> 01:01:07.366
Story of my life,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.934
the men I'm interested in
aren't the ones interested in me.

01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:16.573
Really? I would think all men
would be interested in you.

01:01:17.217 --> 01:01:19.981
- Why do you say that?
- Because...

01:01:29.562 --> 01:01:34.522
...you are very attractive.
- I will see you in my office in five.

01:01:41.107 --> 01:01:43.507
But really, there is no one?

01:01:46.212 --> 01:01:50.842
Frankly speaking, the one big love
of my life didn't quite work out.

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:52.509
You poor thing.

01:01:56.523 --> 01:01:57.820
Nicole!

01:01:58.825 --> 01:02:03.421
No, no, no, don't let me interrupt.
I only have a message from Vicenzo.

01:02:03.496 --> 01:02:06.260
He wants you both at this address,
immediately.

01:02:06.332 --> 01:02:09.199
He has decided he needs my expertise.

01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:10.759
No. They've solved the case.

01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:13.328
- What?
- They've solved the case.

01:02:22.181 --> 01:02:24.479
Inspector, welcome.

01:02:24.551 --> 01:02:26.451
Even though
we've had certain disagreements,

01:02:26.519 --> 01:02:30.751
<i>we are willing to share the glory with you
out of our respect for la Francia.</i>

01:02:30.823 --> 01:02:33.417
Pepperidge examined the key
and knew right away

01:02:33.493 --> 01:02:35.393
it was made by a French locksmith.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:39.227
Kenji did research on the locksmiths
in Paris who sell this brand.

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:43.133
We asked for a list of addresses
and we found this apartment.

01:02:44.003 --> 01:02:47.632
When we got here,
we found the owner licking the carpet.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:52.708
His name is Laurence Milliken.

01:02:53.413 --> 01:02:55.244
And the stolen items?

01:03:02.455 --> 01:03:04.252
The Shroud of Turin!

01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:08.656
We should have it dry-cleaned
before we return it.

01:03:09.596 --> 01:03:13.225
The Pope's ring.
His wife will be happy to have that back.

01:03:15.134 --> 01:03:18.797
- And where is the Pink Panther?
- Unfortunately, that cannot be recovered.

01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:20.338
No Pink Panther?

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:23.534
- He explained in his suicide note.
- Yes.

01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:28.508
"Life had become horribly dull
and uninteresting.

01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:31.448
"Nothing matched the excitement
of stealing great treasures,

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:32.814
"so I returned,

01:03:32.885 --> 01:03:35.649
"but I found that even stealing
no longer interested me.

01:03:35.722 --> 01:03:38.782
"Without a purpose,
I no longer wish to live.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:43.227
"I am returning every treasure but one.
The Pink Panther.

01:03:43.296 --> 01:03:45.321
"Having it in my possession
for even a few days

01:03:45.398 --> 01:03:48.060
"made me realize its fabulous beauty.

01:03:48.134 --> 01:03:51.467
"No one must have it but me,
so I destroyed it.

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:55.064
"The Pink Panther is dust, a final revenge."

01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:57.974
"Laurence Milliken, the Tornado."

01:04:01.748 --> 01:04:05.946
I spent four years researching and writing
my book. I hoped to meet him alive.

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:09.113
The Tornado was an expert
on gems and their value?

01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:11.418
Yes, in fact, Milliken was the author

01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:14.187
of the most authoritative book
on the subject.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:18.959
This man did not commit these crimes.
The case has not been solved.

01:04:19.032 --> 01:04:23.025
But, look, there's the wound
from 10 years ago.

01:04:23.102 --> 01:04:25.627
- I stake my reputation on it.
- Well, that's not much.

01:04:25.705 --> 01:04:27.866
- The media are outside.
- Then I will announce

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.841
- that we have solved the case.
- I wouldn't.

01:04:31.844 --> 01:04:34.642
- I will.
- I wouldn't do it.

01:04:35.314 --> 01:04:38.841
- I am going to.
- I wouldn't.

01:04:45.024 --> 01:04:49.723
I am delighted to announce
that we have found IL Tornado.

01:04:49.796 --> 01:04:52.060
The dead man in the apartment

01:04:52.131 --> 01:04:55.123
is indubitably
the perpetrator of these crimes.

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:58.762
Actually, one of us disagrees
with this hypothesis.

01:04:58.838 --> 01:05:01.705
I am sure that Milliken is not the thief.

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:10.709
Hold it. We're getting the report
on the DNA evidence.

01:05:10.783 --> 01:05:14.480
The DNA taken from the body
of Laurence Milliken today

01:05:14.554 --> 01:05:18.251
and the DNA taken 10 years ago
from the blood of the Tornado

01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:22.124
are a 100% match.

01:05:23.463 --> 01:05:26.125
The man inside is the Tornado.

01:05:32.839 --> 01:05:35.501
I'd like to thank my colleagues
for their assistance,

01:05:35.575 --> 01:05:38.806
<i>and especially one of your own
here in la Francia.</i>

01:05:38.878 --> 01:05:42.905
My most heartfelt appreciation
to Nicoletta.

01:05:45.885 --> 01:05:49.321
You are a beacon of light
in a forest of darkness.

01:05:49.388 --> 01:05:54.917
Nicole is no less a thief than IL Tornado
because she has stolen this.

01:06:21.754 --> 01:06:23.415
Your mama is here.

01:06:24.357 --> 01:06:26.587
Say goodbye to Uncle Jacques.

01:06:27.093 --> 01:06:30.494
- Goodbye, Uncle Jacques.
- We love you, Uncle Jacques.

01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:34.395
You are two fine, young, little pig persons.

01:06:35.568 --> 01:06:37.695
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:41.729
- When will you be coming home, Papa?
- I'm not sure.

01:06:41.808 --> 01:06:43.036
Goodbye.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:54.648
Well, Ponton,
we are two available men alone in Paris,

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.314
the most exciting city in the world.

01:06:58.257 --> 01:07:00.225
How should we spend our evening?

01:07:03.262 --> 01:07:06.595
- What sort of shampoo is this?
- Jojoba.

01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:08.429
- Jojoba.
- Jojoba.

01:07:09.402 --> 01:07:11.370
Let me see the bottle.

01:07:14.774 --> 01:07:18.835
- It's spelled "Jojoba."
- It's pronounced "Hohoba."

01:07:18.911 --> 01:07:23.177
It's spelled "Jojoba,"
but it's pronounced "Hohoba."

01:07:23.249 --> 01:07:26.446
- "Hohoba."
- Why would they do something like that?

01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:03.588
Well, Ponton, I think our bachelor night
is going very well. Who needs women?

01:08:03.656 --> 01:08:05.886
I'm going back home
to my wife and children.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:11.726
- What? What brought this on?
- You. I don't wish to end up... I mean...

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:15.733
I have decided that love and family
must not come second.

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:19.100
If I may, Inspector,
look what that thinking has done for you.

01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:23.335
What? I'm very happy living alone
with my various shampoos.

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:27.277
Inspector, I still think you are
the best detective in the world.

01:08:27.345 --> 01:08:32.215
Yet, when it comes to love, you never see
what is staring you right in the face.

01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:37.548
Take Nicole, for example.
Do you know the color of her eyes?

01:08:37.622 --> 01:08:40.615
Her pet's name? Her favorite song?

01:08:40.693 --> 01:08:44.685
You can recite an entire section
of every statute in French criminal law,

01:08:44.764 --> 01:08:48.791
but you don't know the first thing
about the woman who loves you.

01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:54.334
Her eyes are brown.

01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:59.041
She loves the smell of vanilla.

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.013
She's allergic to shellfish.

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:07.109
She has a small scar on her ankle,
which I gave her.

01:09:08.321 --> 01:09:11.415
She loves her cats, Mindy and Wendy,

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:18.794
and Cindy, Delores, Frank,
Maxime, Caligula and Louise.

01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:22.660
And she does not think she is pretty.

01:09:23.469 --> 01:09:26.233
And I can never tell her she is pretty.

01:09:26.305 --> 01:09:28.830
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

01:09:30.576 --> 01:09:36.606
If she knew how pretty she is,
she might choose someone other than me.

01:09:39.018 --> 01:09:40.712
- Ponton.
- Yes?

01:09:42.287 --> 01:09:43.845
I need a hug.

01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:46.817
Okay.

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:50.394
And now, conditioner.

01:09:53.799 --> 01:09:58.259
<i>After more than a decade, the infamous
Tornado has finally been unmasked.</i>

01:09:58.337 --> 01:10:01.067
<i>Thanks to the work
of the international Dream Team.</i>

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:05.008
<i>Their success is being celebrated tonight
in a very exclusive event.</i>

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:09.776
<i>Let's go live now to the Petit Palais
in Paris, where the gala is underway.</i>

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.187
So, tell us about the case.

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:26.254
This was really not
one of my most challenging cases.

01:10:26.332 --> 01:10:28.027
I'm surprised it even took us this long...

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.001
My powers of observation
are so finely tuned by this point

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.369
that just one look at any situation,
and ideas come flooding into me.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.000
Modern technology makes
the modern criminal obsolete.

01:10:37.076 --> 01:10:39.442
And what about the Pink Panther?

01:10:43.082 --> 01:10:48.179
<i>- Too bad it was destroyed.
- Yes, we're very sorry about that.</i>

01:10:48.254 --> 01:10:49.812
<i>Three out of four isn't bad.</i>

01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:51.948
<i>- 75%.
- Yes, brilliant.</i>

01:11:04.837 --> 01:11:07.271
- Inspector.
- Miss Solandres.

01:11:07.339 --> 01:11:09.364
- Quite a snarl here.
- Yes, I know.

01:11:09.442 --> 01:11:13.401
A spot just opened up. Take it.
I'll watch the meter for you.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:19.642
- Nice car.
- It's a rental.

01:11:20.186 --> 01:11:23.849
I figured Paris, excitement,
romance, you know.

01:11:23.923 --> 01:11:27.859
- I'm leaving Paris tonight, on the redeye.
- Bon voyage.

01:11:27.927 --> 01:11:29.656
Goodbye, Inspector.

01:11:36.769 --> 01:11:38.498
- You know Mrs. Dreyfus?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:41.540
Well, let me know immediately
if she arrives.

01:11:49.482 --> 01:11:51.006
- Nicole.
- Yes.

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.847
- I thought you might be hungry.
- Well...

01:11:54.887 --> 01:11:58.220
- That is very thoughtful of you.
- Cute car.

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.383
It's Miss Solandres' car.

01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:06.089
- Well, it's a little chilly out here, so...
- Nicole?

01:12:10.269 --> 01:12:12.169
You are very pretty.

01:12:12.972 --> 01:12:17.136
Well, that's odd. Some would say
I was drab and disgusting.

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:20.110
Well, who in their right mind
could call you drab and disgusting?

01:12:20.179 --> 01:12:23.171
Whoever could say something like that,
would...

01:12:25.217 --> 01:12:26.343
I said it.

01:12:26.418 --> 01:12:28.477
- He told you?
- Yes, he did.

01:12:30.456 --> 01:12:34.449
I only said it
because I didn't want him to...

01:12:34.527 --> 01:12:35.789
To what?

01:12:37.296 --> 01:12:39.287
To fall in love with you.

01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:47.931
I don't know what to think.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:29.905
<i>- Ponton speaking.
- Ponton, here's what I want you to do.</i>

01:13:33.319 --> 01:13:35.685
I'm thinking of recommending

01:13:35.754 --> 01:13:39.554
the establishment of a permanent
international police force,

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:43.391
which, of course,
I would be prepared to command.

01:13:54.106 --> 01:13:55.471
Excuse me.

01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:04.245
- What?
- I have solved the case.

01:14:05.284 --> 01:14:07.582
- What?
- I have solved the case.

01:14:07.653 --> 01:14:11.885
The case has been solved, Clouseau.
That is why we're having the party,

01:14:11.957 --> 01:14:14.687
you see, because we've solved the case.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.905
Are you all right, Chief Inspector?

01:14:29.975 --> 01:14:34.105
- It's clueless Clouseau again.
- Is he here?

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:38.616
He's so desperate to regain his status
as the Pink Panther hero

01:14:38.684 --> 01:14:41.585
that he's come up with
the most ingenious theory.

01:14:41.654 --> 01:14:45.715
- What theory?
- That you are the thief.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:47.583
Me?

01:14:50.362 --> 01:14:52.956
And that you have the Pink Panther
here with you.

01:14:53.032 --> 01:14:55.023
Now I'm feeling guilty.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.695
I've been feuding with a man
who is mentally handicapped.

01:14:59.004 --> 01:15:01.871
For one thing, how could Sonia
have performed the theft in Rome?

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.067
We were all there together.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:08.205
Actually, the rest of us were all at the bar.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.410
If you recall, Miss Solandres
stayed home with a headache.

01:15:12.484 --> 01:15:13.508
Well, that's right, but...

01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:16.577
But where would you get the expertise
for these crimes?

01:15:16.655 --> 01:15:20.318
Well, she is the world's
foremost authority on IL Tornado.

01:15:22.795 --> 01:15:27.755
Just as a parlor game, what if
she obtained this expertise directly from...

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:29.858
What if she were his daughter?

01:15:29.935 --> 01:15:31.596
- No, that wouldn't...
- A lover.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:35.037
- Yes, a scorned lover.
- Better. Motive.

01:15:35.107 --> 01:15:38.599
That would explain stealing
the unfenceable items

01:15:38.677 --> 01:15:41.407
- to direct attention...
- To IL Tornado.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.746
So she can bring him out of hiding
and set him up as the perpetrator.

01:15:46.618 --> 01:15:50.782
- Then she could kill him, forge a note...
- And keep the Pink Panther.

01:15:50.856 --> 01:15:53.347
As Clouseau said, the one fenceable item.

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:56.883
Congratulations, gentlemen,
a very diverting and amusing puzzle

01:15:56.962 --> 01:15:59.487
solved in two minutes.

01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:03.561
Bravo.

01:16:06.338 --> 01:16:07.965
Open your purse.

01:16:09.475 --> 01:16:13.206
Nicoletta, you misunderstand.
This is a game, an exercise.

01:16:13.278 --> 01:16:16.736
Yes, but just to complete the game,
let's have a look.

01:16:19.418 --> 01:16:21.409
I have a plane to catch.

01:16:24.456 --> 01:16:26.788
Seriously, gentlemen!

01:16:30.662 --> 01:16:34.098
Okay, let's get this over and done with.

01:16:38.203 --> 01:16:39.727
Oh, my God! He was right.

01:16:43.542 --> 01:16:47.638
Stop! I am the one you want, not her.

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:53.842
Only I possess the evidence that will keep
you in prison for the rest of your life.

01:16:53.919 --> 01:16:56.888
So if you're going to shoot anyone,
shoot me.

01:16:58.090 --> 01:16:59.250
Okay.

01:17:00.993 --> 01:17:03.655
Perhaps I did not think that through.

01:17:08.133 --> 01:17:09.395
Jacques!

01:17:10.736 --> 01:17:12.499
I wish I'd shot him.

01:17:14.706 --> 01:17:17.436
Look, his Medal of Honor
absorbed the bullet.

01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:18.635
- What?
- Not exactly.

01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.645
The bullet ricocheted and killed the waiter.

01:17:22.314 --> 01:17:24.714
Where's Sonia?

01:17:24.783 --> 01:17:27.581
She mustn't escape. I'll stop her.

01:18:04.756 --> 01:18:06.018
Get back.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.029
That gun is pointless. There are four of us,
and you only have four bullets left.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.863
That doesn't add up.

01:18:27.946 --> 01:18:30.915
All right, I'm warning you, Miss Solandres,
I've got a...

01:18:30.983 --> 01:18:32.177
Spoon?

01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:34.278
I've got a knife.

01:19:12.591 --> 01:19:14.582
Stop. You cannot escape.

01:19:21.033 --> 01:19:25.026
- You don't have a match.
- That's right.

01:19:27.573 --> 01:19:30.133
Never use an elevator during a fire.

01:19:32.277 --> 01:19:34.177
Fire? Leave this to me.

01:20:06.244 --> 01:20:09.372
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France,

01:20:09.448 --> 01:20:13.646
you are under arrest for the theft
of the world's most priceless...

01:20:21.259 --> 01:20:23.090
You are under arrest!

01:20:31.203 --> 01:20:33.763
Let me go, or I will destroy it.

01:20:33.839 --> 01:20:36.171
- Let her go.
- Let her do it.

01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:38.368
Are you insane?

01:20:57.963 --> 01:20:59.692
Good work, Ponton.

01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:06.866
You moron! You twerp!
You sad excuse for a human being!

01:21:06.938 --> 01:21:11.307
You have just destroyed
the sacred symbol of France!

01:21:12.377 --> 01:21:16.541
- Ponton, did you bring what I asked for?
- Boys.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:23.149
- Here it is, Uncle Jacques.
- Yes, yes.

01:21:24.523 --> 01:21:28.516
I knew the Tornado would eventually
come after the Pink Panther.

01:21:29.061 --> 01:21:33.088
<i>So I went to the mus√©e
with a simple plan in mind.</i>

01:21:33.165 --> 01:21:36.623
<i>I had convinced my old friend,
Robert the night guard,</i>

01:21:36.702 --> 01:21:40.900
<i>to turn off the security system
for the few moments necessary</i>

01:21:40.972 --> 01:21:44.305
<i>to save the most beautiful object
in France.</i>

01:21:44.376 --> 01:21:48.870
I then switched the Pink Panther
with the replica I had at home.

01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:51.845
This is the real Pink Panther.

01:21:54.219 --> 01:21:56.551
It was the fake that was stolen.

01:21:57.856 --> 01:22:00.518
Nightmare. Nightmare.

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:05.229
And when the Tornado,
an expert on the quality of gems,

01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:09.063
<i>wrote in his supposed suicide note
of its great beauty,</i>

01:22:09.134 --> 01:22:14.071
I knew he could never have been the thief.
He would have recognized it as a fake.

01:22:15.207 --> 01:22:17.903
How did you figure out it was Sonia?

01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:21.673
It was because I spent the last 17 months
on parking duty.

01:22:22.581 --> 01:22:23.809
What?

01:22:26.218 --> 01:22:30.086
Today, I was staring
at Miss Solandres' license plate.

01:22:30.155 --> 01:22:35.024
I recognized it because of
my unique system of cross-referencing.

01:22:36.194 --> 01:22:40.255
I became aware that I had
given a ticket to the same car

01:22:40.332 --> 01:22:44.496
<i>two days before Miss Solandres
claimed she arrived in Paris.</i>

01:22:46.037 --> 01:22:49.370
One day before
the Pink Panther was stolen.

01:22:55.347 --> 01:22:57.611
You followed my instructions
very well, Clouseau.

01:22:57.682 --> 01:23:01.618
It was I, of course, who put Clouseau
onto the parking ticket assignment.

01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:04.154
- Isn't that so, Inspector?
- No.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.754
And at Avellaneda's mansion,

01:23:08.827 --> 01:23:11.421
when I sensed the presence
of the Tornado,

01:23:11.496 --> 01:23:13.487
<i>he was there, all right.</i>

01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:17.431
But it was not a he, it was a she!

01:23:25.177 --> 01:23:27.975
Clouseau is the greatest detective
in the world.

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:30.571
His mind is sharper
than all of us combined.

01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:33.209
- Should we tell him?
- Absolutely not.

01:23:45.664 --> 01:23:47.393
Inspector Clouseau.

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:51.761
Sometimes a man must be bold enough
to speak from the heart.

01:23:51.837 --> 01:23:54.431
You deserve to know the truth
about Nicole and I.

01:23:54.506 --> 01:23:58.533
- Stop. I don't want to hear.
- But nothing happened.

01:23:59.344 --> 01:24:01.335
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.576
- It pains me to admit, but no.
- Not even a little smoochie-woochie?

01:24:08.053 --> 01:24:11.853
I never had a chance,
because she only has eyes for one man.

01:24:12.424 --> 01:24:13.482
You.

01:24:14.326 --> 01:24:17.853
Yes, you. Now please, for God's sake,
kiss her already.

01:24:23.235 --> 01:24:27.797
Nicole, I have learned that

01:24:27.873 --> 01:24:29.704
no man is an island.

01:24:30.475 --> 01:24:36.744
So would you,
even though it may lead to possible injury,

01:24:38.049 --> 01:24:39.311
marry me?

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:07.171
Inspector Dreyfus, thank you again
for agreeing to conduct the ceremony.

01:25:07.245 --> 01:25:10.305
It makes everything
that much more special.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:20.223
Jacques Clouseau and Nicole Durant.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:23.523
Do you promise to love, honor and obey...

01:25:23.595 --> 01:25:27.087
Wait! A wife does not
have to obey her husband.

01:25:30.702 --> 01:25:35.401
Okay, scrap "obey." Do you promise
to love and honor each other?

01:25:35.473 --> 01:25:36.963
- I do.
- I do.

01:25:37.042 --> 01:25:39.306
Good! So by the powers vested in me

01:25:39.377 --> 01:25:42.244
as Chief Inspector
of the 13th Arrondissement,

01:25:42.314 --> 01:25:45.977
I now declare you husband and wife.

01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:08.466
Here's to peace and harmony.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.648
- The password?
- Hamburger!

01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:19.240
That's not it.

01:26:19.784 --> 01:26:20.944
- Hamburger!
- No!

01:26:21.019 --> 01:26:22.486
- Hamburger!
- No!

01:26:22.554 --> 01:26:26.354
They must have changed it.
Clouseau, your gadget!

01:26:26.424 --> 01:26:28.858
Clouseau, what's the new password?

01:26:29.928 --> 01:26:31.725
It says "low battery."

01:26:31.796 --> 01:26:33.491
- Low battery.
- No!

01:26:33.565 --> 01:26:36.056
No, wait. That means the battery is low.

01:26:36.134 --> 01:26:38.534
It wants me to go online
and renew my subscription.

01:26:38.603 --> 01:26:42.937
- For God's sake, Clouseau!
- Kenji, please take care of this.

01:26:43.975 --> 01:26:46.034
We have a plane to catch.

01:26:48.646 --> 01:26:50.876
- Was it beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

01:26:50.949 --> 01:26:53.315
- Here are your glasses.
- Thanks.

01:26:55.553 --> 01:26:56.645
Wait.

01:27:02.627 --> 01:27:05.357
- Was my mother there?
- Yes, absolutely!

01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:08.263
- Can't you hear her screaming?
- Not really.
