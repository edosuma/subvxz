Jeremy: What have you done with Malcolm?

00:06.701 --> 00:07.900
He's going to be the thing

00:07.902 --> 00:09.301
that saves our girl, Savannah.

00:09.303 --> 00:10.702
We need him to lure this demon

00:10.704 --> 00:12.504
who calls himself Aleister Vi.

00:12.506 --> 00:14.806
Savannah was kidnapped by this force.

00:14.808 --> 00:16.341
I had a strange dream last night.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.709
There was a man in a barn...

00:17.711 --> 00:19.111
He turns into a wolf.

00:19.113 --> 00:20.945
I have been looking for you.

00:24.517 --> 00:26.317
We've never done anything to you.

00:26.319 --> 00:27.719
Yes, you have, Ruth.

00:27.721 --> 00:29.286
More than you know right now.

00:29.288 --> 00:32.055
Time to say goodbye.

00:32.058 --> 00:33.992
Gah!

Goodbye.

00:36.429 --> 00:37.895
the one who I told you was screaming.

00:37.897 --> 00:40.431
He said that she was in pain
because of the baby.

00:40.433 --> 00:41.765
That's Rachel.

00:43.301 --> 00:44.635
Clayton: Where did they take her?

00:44.637 --> 00:47.471
Where did they take Elena and Logan?

00:47.473 --> 00:48.972
No, no, no!

He's dangerous!

05:56.107 --> 05:58.174

05:58.176 --> 06:00.442
but that is not who he really is.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.411

about our connection.

06:02.413 --> 06:04.213
- Do you understand?
- I know!

06:04.215 --> 06:06.415
Ask her if Elena's there.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.117
Have you seen a woman?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.785

06:10.787 --> 06:12.487
There's a woman in the room beside me.

06:12.489 --> 06:15.156

that her name was Elena.

06:15.158 --> 06:16.625
Did you see her?

06:21.364 --> 06:24.298

I'll explain later. Don't worry.

06:31.742 --> 06:33.007
I didn't see her face.

06:33.009 --> 06:34.542
She kicked a hole through the wall.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.613
Is she there now?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.214
They just took her again.

06:40.216 --> 06:41.515
They're doing tests on her.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.016
Tests? Do they do tests on you?

06:43.018 --> 06:44.218
Tell me what's going on.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.419
Savannah, do they do tests on you?

06:45.421 --> 06:47.288
No, I told you!

06:49.791 --> 06:52.526
What tests are they doing on Elena?

06:52.528 --> 06:54.328
He's...

something for the pain.

person that I've met here.

08:32.091 --> 08:33.289

08:33.292 --> 08:34.525

Don't confuse your true purpose,

13:51.801 --> 13:53.134
nurse Sondra!

13:53.136 --> 13:56.003
What we need from her is her wolf blood.

13:57.338 --> 13:59.273
(Stammering)
Of... of course.

13:59.275 --> 14:03.177
Everything I do is for you.

14:03.179 --> 14:04.779
And the Undoing.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.150
You will get it for me.

14:10.152 --> 14:12.819
And you will get it to work.

14:12.821 --> 14:15.689
I chose you for a reason, Sondra.

14:28.502 --> 14:29.836
(Sighing)

14:29.838 --> 14:33.173
So, I heard about what happened.

14:33.175 --> 14:35.308
Clay's pretty anxious.

14:35.310 --> 14:39.312
Do you think you could
try Savannah back?

14:39.314 --> 14:40.413
I can't just...

14:40.415 --> 14:44.317
dial again when the connection's broken.

14:44.319 --> 14:46.185
She must have just been interrupted.

14:46.187 --> 14:47.587
If she can't connect with me,

14:47.589 --> 14:49.322
I can't force it.

14:49.324 --> 14:51.190
What about that marble thing, I mean,

14:51.192 --> 14:53.025
can't that just find her?

14:53.027 --> 14:56.195
You think that we wouldn't
have done that already?

14:56.197 --> 14:58.330
Sorry, I'm just trying to help.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.366
I know.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.339
I'm just feeling it today...

15:09.542 --> 15:11.043
All the loss.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.547
It's like I feel so powerless.

15:15.549 --> 15:18.717
Powerless?

15:18.719 --> 15:20.885
Are you kidding me?

15:20.887 --> 15:24.222
First time I met you
you made my eyes bleed.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.891
We have a common enemy now, Paige.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.727
We will find our people.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.195
Together.

15:34.633 --> 15:35.967
(Whispering)
Okay.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.702
She's dead.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.239
I still don't understand
how this is going to help.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.374
- There's still time.
- For what?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.576
A small electrical charge
remains in the brain

15:45.578 --> 15:48.379
a few hours after death.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.913
I'm going to need some salt,

15:49.915 --> 15:51.915
some fresh thyme, some lavender,

15:51.917 --> 15:53.250
candles, and a broom.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.387
Really?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.922
Huh, yes, a witch's broomstick.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.457
Yes, some clichés are grounded in truth.

16:01.459 --> 16:02.558
Whatever you need.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.394
We're going to need
to know her real name.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.063
If we act quickly, we may get
some valuable information.

16:07.065 --> 16:11.101
I don't see how a funeral rite's
going to give us new information.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.271
We're not going to bury her...

16:14.273 --> 16:16.406
She's going to tell us
where Aleister is.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.254
I saw what they gave you for breakfast.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.356
I thought you could use
something more substantial.

16:31.394 --> 16:32.727
Oh...

16:37.401 --> 16:39.735
(Electrical whirring)

16:41.404 --> 16:43.072
Oh, no poison, no drugs.

16:43.074 --> 16:45.407
(Laughs)
I promise.

16:45.409 --> 16:47.076
Mmm? Mm...

16:56.586 --> 16:58.920
I know. This isn't easy.

16:58.922 --> 17:00.389
But I'm here to help.

17:00.391 --> 17:02.391
We just need a small sample, that's all.

17:02.393 --> 17:04.925
You've already taken samples
from every part of me.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.761
What more do you need?

17:06.762 --> 17:08.762
Just one little vial of blood.

17:08.765 --> 17:10.765
After you've turned into a werewolf.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.300
That's all you need?

17:13.303 --> 17:14.603
Just my wolf blood?

17:14.605 --> 17:16.771
That's all we need.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.339
Not gonna happen.

17:21.109 --> 17:22.777
If you don't give it willingly,

17:22.779 --> 17:24.112
it will be taken from you.

17:24.114 --> 17:26.781
I'm just trying to protect you.

17:26.782 --> 17:28.782
Oh, so now you're my friend, huh?

17:28.784 --> 17:30.784
I recognize how special you are.

17:30.786 --> 17:32.587
I don't want harm to come to you.

17:32.589 --> 17:36.224
Why aren't you like
everyone else, hypnotized?

17:36.226 --> 17:38.792
I don't need "the focus" to
have passion for my work.

17:38.794 --> 17:42.263
This is a great honor, Elena.

17:42.265 --> 17:45.265
You can lift the veil
on so many mysteries.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.768
Together, we can achieve great things.

17:49.470 --> 17:50.671
I'm not going to help you.

17:50.673 --> 17:53.807
You are blind, but you will see.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.809
You also tried to make me deaf.

17:55.811 --> 17:57.911
Was that all a part of protecting me?

18:01.149 --> 18:03.183
Take her back to her cell.

18:03.185 --> 18:04.317
For now.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.492
(Suspenseful music)

18:12.494 --> 18:15.162
(Heavy breathing)

18:15.164 --> 18:23.164
( ♪ )

18:24.505 --> 18:26.139
(Lock buzzing)

18:32.619 --> 18:34.180
There is no way that you're doing this.

18:34.182 --> 18:35.681
You can't contact the dead!

18:35.683 --> 18:37.015
It is way too dangerous.

18:37.017 --> 18:38.850
It will be fine, Paige.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.852
Fine?

18:40.854 --> 18:42.655
It is <i>dark</i> magic.

18:42.657 --> 18:44.323
Left hand path.

18:44.325 --> 18:46.692
You're the one who always
says it is not our way.

18:46.694 --> 18:48.026
We must do what's necessary.

18:48.028 --> 18:51.496
But you have never done this.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.700
No one in our Coven has tried this
for, like, three generations.

18:54.702 --> 18:56.501
Savannah is about to
come into her powers.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.504
That's why he took her,
she's an easy mark.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.040
He might lead her down
the left hand path.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.709
So, you'll flirt with dark magic

19:03.711 --> 19:05.210
to save her from what may happen?

19:05.212 --> 19:08.213
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Paige,

19:08.215 --> 19:11.216
we need to know who he is, where he is.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.718
This could be our last chance.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.052
We need to find Savannah

19:15.054 --> 19:17.455
before he ruins the rest of her life.

19:19.891 --> 19:21.559
Well, if he's a witch...

19:21.561 --> 19:23.560
Not "if".

19:23.562 --> 19:25.429
You know he's a witch.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.400
Well, that means that somebody
broke the commandment.

19:52.823 --> 19:54.391
Savannah. Savannah!

19:54.425 --> 19:57.127
- Oh, what?
Elena: - We're breaking out of here.

19:57.161 --> 19:59.796
I'm going to get you
back to Paige and Ruth.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.132
Have you been outside?

20:02.166 --> 20:03.800
What can you see when you're out there?

20:03.834 --> 20:06.302
I don't know... buildings, trees.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.703
Savannah: Why?

20:07.738 --> 20:09.305
Are there any mountains, water,

20:09.339 --> 20:11.641
a bridge, anything that could
help get us out of here?

20:11.675 --> 20:13.309
(Gasp)

20:13.343 --> 20:14.744
Why should I trust you?

20:16.346 --> 20:18.314
Savannah, Aleister is using you.

20:18.348 --> 20:21.150
I am trying to help you.

20:21.184 --> 20:23.185
You're a werewolf.

20:23.219 --> 20:26.121
I'm locked up here because of you.
It's for my safety.

20:26.156 --> 20:27.990
Elena: Is that what he's telling you?

20:28.024 --> 20:29.391
Look, you can trust me.

20:29.425 --> 20:31.994
Okay? You're family came to us for help.

20:32.028 --> 20:33.996
My mother's dead.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.865
Paige and Ruth aren't my family.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.167
They want to control me.

20:38.201 --> 20:41.203
They may not be blood,
okay, but they love you.

20:41.237 --> 20:42.604
Elena: They care for you.

20:42.638 --> 20:44.273
They just say they do.

20:44.307 --> 20:46.775
Aleister wants me
to reach my full potential.

20:46.809 --> 20:49.243
Aleister is the one
trying to control you!

20:49.278 --> 20:50.679
Ugh!

20:52.147 --> 20:53.782
(Intercom buzz)
Guard?

20:53.816 --> 20:55.149
The werewolf's bugging me.

21:02.925 --> 21:04.391
(Electric whirring)

21:04.426 --> 21:07.128
(Electric pulsing)
Elena: (Groaning in pain)

21:07.162 --> 21:09.130
(Dull thudding)
Ah!

21:09.164 --> 21:10.898
(Electric whirring and pulsing)

21:27.914 --> 21:30.616
I know a thing or two about painting.
Am I allowed to help?

21:31.885 --> 21:33.886
Huh...

21:33.888 --> 21:35.888
The mirror opposite of this hand.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.223
All right.

21:44.464 --> 21:47.833
How many witches are in your Coven?

21:47.835 --> 21:50.769
There's just me and Paige,

21:50.771 --> 21:53.438
since Savannah's been
taken, and Bridget...

21:58.944 --> 22:01.312
There are several small covens

22:01.314 --> 22:03.314
across North America.

22:03.316 --> 22:07.652
Yet yours is the only one
on the hunt for Savannah.

22:07.654 --> 22:11.089
You're playing it pretty
close to the vest.

22:11.091 --> 22:14.225
I know what that's like.

22:14.227 --> 22:16.460
Better to keep it within the Pack.

22:18.230 --> 22:20.798
There's something to
be said for autonomy.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.235
You said that witches
never have male children.

22:24.237 --> 22:26.604
Yet one seems to exist.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.008
How is there a male witch?

22:31.010 --> 22:32.410
If I knew the answer to that,

22:32.412 --> 22:36.079
I wouldn't need to do what...

22:36.081 --> 22:37.581
what I need to do.

22:41.252 --> 22:43.020
You're not telling me something.

22:43.022 --> 22:46.290
I'm telling you everything I know.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.191
And I'm doing everything in my power

22:48.193 --> 22:50.027
to find out who Aleister is.

22:53.631 --> 22:55.532
Of course you are.

23:03.474 --> 23:04.674
(Wet thud)

23:04.676 --> 23:06.008
(Lock clattering)

23:12.616 --> 23:14.150
(Grunts of effort)

23:15.753 --> 23:17.353
Logan?

23:17.355 --> 23:19.055
My God, how did you get here?

23:19.057 --> 23:20.256
Thank you!

23:20.258 --> 23:21.824
Oh, I thought I lost you.

23:21.826 --> 23:23.625
How are you? How's everything?
Is he okay?

23:23.627 --> 23:25.561
- How's the baby?
- I don't know. (Bell ringing)

23:25.563 --> 23:26.996
I don't know. We keep doing these tests.

23:26.998 --> 23:28.364
Logan, we have to get out of here.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.532
Listen, I know where
they hide the vehicles.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.234
So we're just going to hike until dark,

23:32.236 --> 23:33.635
then I'm going to get us out of here. No!

23:33.637 --> 23:35.036
The bell sounded. That
means they're coming

23:35.038 --> 23:36.805
to take me to the Gentling room.

23:36.807 --> 23:38.807
The what? W-w-w-what the hell
happens in the Gentling room?

23:38.809 --> 23:41.810
I will not go back there.
We have to go now.

23:41.812 --> 23:44.412
They... they come from that
direction, two of them.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.516
Okay, let's go.

23:51.687 --> 23:53.621
(Panting)

24:24.219 --> 24:25.552
(Grunts of effort)

24:39.967 --> 24:41.300
(Light switch clanging)

24:41.302 --> 24:42.802
Ugh!
(Current buzzing)

24:51.012 --> 24:52.812
You told them where to find me.

24:54.081 --> 24:55.448
Richard?

24:55.450 --> 24:57.850
When this door opens,

24:57.852 --> 24:59.452
I'm going to kill you.

25:04.247 --> 25:05.447
Sondra: You will have

25:05.449 --> 25:06.882
a short time to Change.

25:06.884 --> 25:09.017
(On loudspeaker)
<i>This is a controlled experiment</i>

25:09.019 --> 25:10.386
<i>to observe combat.</i>

25:10.388 --> 25:11.853
Richard, don't do it.

25:11.855 --> 25:14.790
That's exactly what they want you to do.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.992
I told you everything that you needed

25:16.994 --> 25:18.194
to find Malcolm,

25:18.196 --> 25:19.394
and still, you gave me up

25:19.396 --> 25:21.496
to these sadistic bastards.

25:22.398 --> 25:23.999
We're done talking.

25:24.001 --> 25:25.466
90 seconds.

25:25.468 --> 25:27.736
I didn't give you up, it's a lie.

25:27.738 --> 25:29.137
They want you to fight me!

25:29.139 --> 25:30.339
They... they want us to Change

25:30.340 --> 25:32.140
and then they'll kill us both!

25:32.142 --> 25:33.541
Richard: Nice try.

25:33.543 --> 25:35.610
You're trying to trick me

25:35.612 --> 25:37.912
so I won't Change.

25:37.914 --> 25:39.314
Then you will.

25:39.316 --> 25:41.416
There were other werewolves here.

25:41.418 --> 25:43.518
Huh! Do you see them around?

25:45.254 --> 25:46.588
They're in jars now!

25:46.590 --> 25:49.156
If I don't fight you,

25:49.158 --> 25:51.792
I'll end up in jars too.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.230
Richard...

25:56.232 --> 25:57.431
please.

25:57.433 --> 25:58.833
Sondra: <i>60 seconds.</i>

25:58.835 --> 26:01.068
(Groaning)

26:01.070 --> 26:02.870
(Growling, snarling)

26:02.872 --> 26:04.404
(Bones, flesh creaking)

26:09.544 --> 26:11.044
(Menacing growl)

26:11.046 --> 26:12.613
She's going to do it,
we're almost there.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.080
He's twice her size, he'll demolish her.

26:14.082 --> 26:15.716
I've seen what she's capable of,

26:15.718 --> 26:17.351
she can hold her own.
If he turns into a wolf

26:17.353 --> 26:18.619
and she doesn't, it's all over.

26:18.621 --> 26:19.819
If he kills her, that's it,

26:19.821 --> 26:21.421
the only female will be destroyed.

26:21.423 --> 26:23.423
She can die, just not as a human.

26:23.425 --> 26:25.391
We need her wolf blood.

26:27.928 --> 26:28.962
Ten...

26:28.964 --> 26:32.232
<i>nine, eight,</i>
(Panting)

41:43.923 --> 41:48.325
The moon is special to my Coven...

41:48.327 --> 41:49.626
to all witches.

41:49.628 --> 41:51.695
Elena: Your Coven is out there...

41:51.697 --> 41:53.497
right now, under the same moon,

41:53.499 --> 41:54.965
searching for you.

41:58.035 --> 41:59.970
They're going to find us.

42:01.406 --> 42:04.774
Until then, I'll protect you.

42:13.017 --> 42:15.418
I know what it's like

42:15.420 --> 42:17.220
to be scared and alone

42:17.222 --> 42:19.555
and not know who to trust.

42:22.759 --> 42:24.627
I promise,

42:24.629 --> 42:27.630
I won't let anything happen to you.

42:30.734 --> 42:31.867
Okay?

42:53.790 --> 42:54.922
Okay.

42:58.093 --> 42:59.528
(Sobbing quietly)

42:59.530 --> 43:02.129
(Suspenseful ♪)

( ♪ )

43:09.004 --> 43:10.571
Come with me.

43:10.573 --> 43:13.707
We will go through the Gate together.

43:13.709 --> 43:15.342
It didn't work.
(Panting)

43:15.344 --> 43:17.077
You failed me.

43:17.079 --> 43:19.079
No, I can get it to work.

43:19.081 --> 43:20.613
I just need more time.

43:20.615 --> 43:22.883
(Panting)
We don't have any more time.

43:27.321 --> 43:30.123
We must all make sacrifices.

43:33.894 --> 43:36.663
You'll never need anyone else!

43:36.665 --> 43:38.298
