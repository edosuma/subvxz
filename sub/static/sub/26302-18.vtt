Do you think you can get him
before he kills you?

35:59.654 --> 36:01.566
Beg your pardon?

36:01.590 --> 36:03.735
Well, I told him about
your obsession with his wife.

36:03.759 --> 36:05.103
Didn't go over too well.

36:05.127 --> 36:08.006
Turns out, he's obsessed
with her, too.

36:08.030 --> 36:11.175
You might've wanted me, but
he's the big flashy takedown.

36:11.199 --> 36:13.644
Exactly what you need
to make a name for yourself.

36:13.668 --> 36:15.702
I see where you're going.

36:17.806 --> 36:20.284
You want another
little nibble of the cookie.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.921
I get Lucious; you get his wife.

36:23.945 --> 36:26.624
I'll take Lucious now.

36:26.648 --> 36:28.848
Next year, the 20 mil.

36:42.927 --> 36:46.506
Um, girl, why you got me up in
here breathing in this asbestos?

36:46.530 --> 36:49.076
Because I heard you, sis,
about being tired

36:49.100 --> 36:50.844
of not getting credit for what you do,

36:50.868 --> 36:52.579
and because I share your pain.

36:52.603 --> 36:55.082
See, I thought
we should present the Lyons

36:55.106 --> 36:57.918
with a business plan
for our own imprint.

36:57.942 --> 37:01.188
Way we could make our own
decisions, sign our own artists.

37:01.212 --> 37:02.689
But if we have our own imprint,

37:02.713 --> 37:04.558
Lucious would still be
pulling the strings.

37:04.582 --> 37:06.560
If we had our own label,

37:06.584 --> 37:09.429
owned by women... us...

37:09.453 --> 37:12.199
run by women... us...

37:12.223 --> 37:14.935
for women... us.

37:14.959 --> 37:17.104
With what money?

37:17.128 --> 37:19.973
I spoke to my business manager
this morning,

37:19.997 --> 37:24.211
and I'm dumping my equity
in Empire, all of it.

37:24.235 --> 37:25.445
And if you do the same...

37:25.469 --> 37:27.147
The same?! Bitch, I ain't got it!

37:27.171 --> 37:29.149
It's 80/20. That's the split.

37:29.173 --> 37:32.152
80/20? Are you out your mind?

37:32.176 --> 37:35.555
Do you even know
how many record labels fail?

37:35.579 --> 37:38.392
Why would "us" do this?

37:38.416 --> 37:40.227
Because I believe in us.

37:40.251 --> 37:42.929
What we have together is real,

37:42.953 --> 37:46.800
but what we can do together is epic.

37:46.824 --> 37:49.403
- We could pull our own strings.
- Yeah.

37:49.427 --> 37:51.960
Finally get credit for what we do.

37:57.268 --> 37:58.645
30/70.

37:58.669 --> 38:01.782
(BOTH SCREAMING)

38:01.806 --> 38:05.619
Welcome to Bossy Records, girl.

38:05.643 --> 38:07.187
- Bossy? Bo... You sure?
- Yes, Bossy.

38:07.211 --> 38:08.622
What about The Shempire, huh?

38:08.646 --> 38:10.846
- GISELLE: Uh...
- BECKY: What about Okurrr?

38:14.719 --> 38:16.997
What are you doing, man?

38:17.021 --> 38:19.433
Taking care of my business.

38:19.457 --> 38:20.867
No, you're-you're being emotional.

38:20.891 --> 38:23.036
Okay, let's just,
let's just take it easy.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.305
Take it easy? I will take it easy

38:25.329 --> 38:28.308
when Damon Cross' ass
is six feet underground.

38:28.332 --> 38:30.043
- That's when I'll take it easy.
- Uh, look...

38:30.067 --> 38:31.611
He tried to take my wife!

38:31.635 --> 38:33.280
Wh-What, you think Conway
showed you those photos

38:33.304 --> 38:34.748
'cause she wanted to play
marriage counselor?

38:34.772 --> 38:37.217
Come on, she's just trying
to wind you up. Think about it.

38:37.241 --> 38:41.822
She is good at her damn job
'cause I'm wound up!

38:41.846 --> 38:43.724
Listen to me. My peoples
tell me Cross flipped.

38:43.748 --> 38:45.625
He's working with Conway.
He fed her enough lies

38:45.649 --> 38:47.894
so she could get a warrant
with your name on it.

38:47.918 --> 38:50.497
Yeah, well, don't you even
want to hear my plan?

38:50.521 --> 38:53.834
Okay, man. All right.
Tell me your plan.

38:53.858 --> 38:56.636
Plan is I go and finish him.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.538
Then I'm-a take off for a little bit

38:58.562 --> 39:00.640
until I find out
what Conway has on me,

39:00.664 --> 39:02.642
and then I'm gonna return.

39:02.666 --> 39:05.011
Well, Conway's plan is
to arrest you by noon,

39:05.035 --> 39:07.247
throw your ass in Rikers
where she can hold you

39:07.271 --> 39:08.749
for two years with no bail!

39:08.773 --> 39:11.885
But you go ahead, you go ahead
and waste time chasing Cross.

39:11.909 --> 39:13.942
You'll be playing yourself.

39:16.380 --> 39:18.413
Come on, man.

39:22.887 --> 39:24.831
Okay.

39:24.855 --> 39:26.989
We'll cross paths another day.

39:29.927 --> 39:34.908
Thirst, I built this empire
for my boys.

39:34.932 --> 39:39.346
Please make sure that they
look after it until I get back.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.748
Your boys are men now,

39:41.772 --> 39:44.439
and I will be there
whenever they need me.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.683
♪ ♪

40:06.096 --> 40:09.309
Come on, baby. It's about time.

40:09.333 --> 40:13.947
That damn U.S. attorney chick
is spreading all these lies,

40:13.971 --> 40:16.149
trying to pin me down on some stuff,

40:16.173 --> 40:18.585
so I figured we'd take off
for a little bit,

40:18.609 --> 40:21.543
and then, when things get better...

40:23.347 --> 40:26.259
Now-now-now, look.

40:26.283 --> 40:28.161
Baby, I know, I know.

40:28.185 --> 40:31.631
I know it's a lot,
but she is relentless.

40:31.655 --> 40:35.769
She has gone to manufacturing
pictures to try and look like

40:35.793 --> 40:37.804
you and Damon were sleeping together.

40:37.828 --> 40:39.306
You hear what I'm saying?

40:39.330 --> 40:41.675
I'm not leaving my son, Lucious.

40:41.699 --> 40:44.578
I'm not leaving my family again.

40:44.602 --> 40:46.346
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no.

40:46.370 --> 40:48.415
No, you don't have to worry
about Andre.

40:48.439 --> 40:50.250
I talked to Teri.

40:50.274 --> 40:54.688
Teri promised me that she was
gonna look after him. Come on.

40:54.712 --> 40:58.491
You promised we would be better.
We ain't better, Lucious.

40:58.515 --> 41:01.761
Will you get... just get on
the damn helicopter.

41:01.785 --> 41:03.685
No, I'm not.

41:06.490 --> 41:08.657
Ride or die is over.

41:10.628 --> 41:13.540
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

41:13.564 --> 41:17.143
Back when I got out,

41:17.167 --> 41:19.613
I told you I wanted
half of my company.

41:19.637 --> 41:22.449
I gave you half of the company.

41:22.473 --> 41:24.351
But all I really wanted
was all of you.

41:24.375 --> 41:25.886
That's what you got
is all of me right now...

41:25.910 --> 41:28.154
You...

41:28.178 --> 41:32.058
you and Empire,
you're not good for me.

41:32.082 --> 41:33.793
Mm-mm.

41:33.817 --> 41:39.388
I will not sacrifice me
or my sons for you anymore.

41:42.660 --> 41:45.872
Baby, you... you love me.

41:45.896 --> 41:49.809
It's not enough, Lucious.
It's not enough, Lucious!

41:49.833 --> 41:52.479
It's not enough, okay?

41:52.503 --> 41:55.682
I can't trust you.

41:55.706 --> 41:59.052
Your lies, your s... blindsides.

41:59.076 --> 42:02.355
You hurt me too many times, okay?

42:02.379 --> 42:06.359
I got to put me first.
I got to put me first!

42:06.383 --> 42:08.395
- I got to put me first, Lucious!
- I-I understand that,

42:08.419 --> 42:11.064
and I promise you
I hear everything you're saying,

42:11.088 --> 42:13.266
and when we get to where we're
going, we're gonna talk about...

42:13.290 --> 42:15.568
- Damon Cross! Damon Cross!
- Wait, what...

42:15.592 --> 42:18.405
I slept with him, okay?
I slept with him.

42:18.429 --> 42:20.573
I said it.
