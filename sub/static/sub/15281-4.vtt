00:18.505 --> 00:19.779
Everybody, down!

00:20.045 --> 00:21.748
Everybody, down!

00:35.185 --> 00:36.879
I think I said watch it.

00:41.105 --> 00:42.792
I said watch it!

00:52.645 --> 00:55.675
Please, don't.

01:00.235 --> 01:02.842
Over the past two months, the
L.A. Field office has been tracking

01:02.845 --> 01:05.941
a series of 4 bank robberies
in the L.A. Metro area.

01:05.945 --> 01:08.481
It's one individual
wearing a black ski mask.

01:08.483 --> 01:10.931
He's highly skilled.
It's his unique M.O.

01:10.966 --> 01:13.336
that put him squarely in our court.

01:13.338 --> 01:15.123
This happened two days ago.

01:18.698 --> 01:20.221
He's making them undress?

01:20.227 --> 01:22.590
He takes their clothes and
locks them in the vault,

01:22.605 --> 01:23.941
then he goes for the cash.

01:24.115 --> 01:25.042
Smart.

01:25.197 --> 01:26.973
Nobody's going to run
after him butt naked.

01:26.988 --> 01:29.283
It's also a psychological advantage.

01:29.376 --> 01:31.231
Make the captives feel exposed,

01:31.245 --> 01:33.551
intimidated, and much
less likely to fight back.

01:33.665 --> 01:35.661
That, and the mac-10
he's waving around.

01:35.676 --> 01:38.730
- Boy's got a lot of firepower.
- But why is this case for us?

01:38.745 --> 01:40.890
Because in the last
robbery, two things changed.

01:40.908 --> 01:44.020
One, he beat the security
guard nearly senseless,

01:44.146 --> 01:46.831
and two, after he made everyone undress,

01:46.846 --> 01:49.951
he forced two pairs of
victims together at gunpoint,

01:49.966 --> 01:52.553
then he made them simulate
sex with each other.

01:56.777 --> 01:59.832
It's remarkable. By
utilizing a practical M.O.

01:59.837 --> 02:01.972
The unsub has stumbled on
to a psychological signature.

02:01.976 --> 02:04.651
- It's fascinating.
- He's a sex offender now.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.661
Fueled by violent rage.

02:07.308 --> 02:09.390
Only our unsub doesn't
know it yet. If he did,

02:09.407 --> 02:11.573
he wouldn't be robbing banks anymore.

02:21.145 --> 02:23.371
So, he's a violent
sex offender in denial.

02:23.386 --> 02:26.291
And a sexual predator who's
just escalated his crimes.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.423
He's a serial killer in the making.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.340
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:12.438 --> 03:14.983
Your cell phone kept going
straight to voicemail.

03:15.048 --> 03:17.071
Yeah, no, I was in a meeting.

03:17.415 --> 03:18.740
Is everything all right?

03:19.086 --> 03:20.283
Going out of town?

03:20.306 --> 03:23.152
Yeah, we gotta go to L.A. I was
going to call you from the car.

03:25.668 --> 03:26.791
What is it?

03:27.048 --> 03:28.741
You really don't know why I'm here?

03:29.616 --> 03:31.861
Honey, I'm sorry, we're running late.

03:34.345 --> 03:36.463
I just got back from the hospital.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.270
- Jack?
- Oh, my God, the tests.

03:42.975 --> 03:45.893
- What happened?
- He's got a condition.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.761
It's treatable and
he's going to be okay.

03:50.776 --> 03:51.962
I'm sorry.

03:54.098 --> 03:55.581
How was he?

03:55.618 --> 03:56.961
Scared.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.792
They put those electrodes all over him
and he was wondering where his daddy was.

04:04.357 --> 04:06.371
- Babe, you promised you'd be there.
- I know.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.743
I'm sorry.

04:11.655 --> 04:12.990
Where is he now?

04:13.098 --> 04:14.871
At home with my mom.

04:15.728 --> 04:17.801
I didn't want him here
while we were talking.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.981
Look, I know this job
is important to you,

04:21.427 --> 04:24.710
- but we're important, too.
- You don't have to tell me that.

04:26.077 --> 04:29.662
I don't want you to wake up
some day in some random city

04:29.777 --> 04:32.262
and realize that you
don't know your own son.

04:35.815 --> 04:37.480
They can go without me.

04:38.765 --> 04:40.432
No, they can't.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.360
It's okay.

04:43.248 --> 04:43.973
Go.

04:44.387 --> 04:46.243
We'll talk about it when you get home.

04:47.897 --> 04:49.331
I'm so sorry.

04:57.548 --> 04:58.583
Sorry

05:06.028 --> 05:09.012
<i>"Man is least himself when
he talks in his own person.</i>

05:09.725 --> 05:12.220
<i>Give him a mask and he
will tell you the truth."</i>

05:12.438 --> 05:14.152
<i>Oscar Wilde.</i>

05:14.687 --> 05:16.853
"Stripping bandit."

05:16.857 --> 05:20.142
That's terrible. That makes it sound
like the bandit's doing the stripping.

05:20.148 --> 05:21.401
What would you call him?

05:21.416 --> 05:22.921
- Pervert.
- Scumbag.

05:22.938 --> 05:24.980
- I'd call him an ass
- Hey, focus, please.

05:24.996 --> 05:27.993
We have the details of the 4 bank robberies
to learn before we get to Los Angeles.

05:27.997 --> 05:31.241
At this point is he more a
bank robber or a sex offender?

05:31.255 --> 05:33.493
Seriously. What's he going to do
next, rob a bank or rape somebody?

05:33.507 --> 05:35.883
I'd say we need to know more
about how he robs the banks

05:35.898 --> 05:39.062
- and who he chooses to victimize.
- Why these banks and why these victims?

05:39.076 --> 05:42.361
Pairing these specific
people together is a fantasy.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.362
If we can figure out the
nature of that fantasy,

05:44.377 --> 05:46.782
we may be able to predict his targets.

05:48.666 --> 05:52.091
In the last robbery I don't see any photos
of what he made the victims actually do.

05:52.247 --> 05:54.921
There is a problem with this
surveillance system. We're working on it.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.150
We should hit the ground running.
How should we break it down?

05:57.175 --> 06:00.583
There's got to be a pattern to the banks.
We should run a geographical profile.

06:00.595 --> 06:01.693
That's yours.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.862
And for the sexual aspects, we need
to look at the specific victimology.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.542
You and I can go with
the victim reports,

06:06.555 --> 06:08.230
see whatever surveillance
footage they've got.

06:08.246 --> 06:09.871
Leaves the unsub himself.

06:09.898 --> 06:11.682
We'll need his perspective.

06:12.707 --> 06:14.170
Crime scene.

06:44.086 --> 06:46.483
The suspect entered around 2:00 P.M.

06:46.495 --> 06:49.392
And a witness said he saw a man
on a motorcycle with a backpack

06:49.447 --> 06:51.913
speed by a few minutes
after the robbery.

06:51.985 --> 06:53.732
Freeway's just a few
blocks that way, right?

06:53.736 --> 06:55.892
Actually, we're within a
half-mile of 3 freeways.

06:55.906 --> 06:57.501
This is a perfect location.

06:57.516 --> 06:59.453
If he's on a bike, he's got
no trouble getting out of here.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.633
Well, first he's got to get to his bike.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.422
- Where's it parked?
- It could be anywhere.

07:04.436 --> 07:05.092
No! No.

07:05.105 --> 07:07.622
A guy this good wouldn't risk his bike
not being anywhere near when he comes out.

07:07.626 --> 07:10.163
He'd park illegally. Probably
not in the parking lot, but

07:10.328 --> 07:12.342
further down the block, maybe, or

07:12.595 --> 07:14.393
or right across the street here.

07:14.416 --> 07:16.782
We need to know if any of these
places have security cameras

07:16.787 --> 07:18.330
that might have caught the bike.

07:18.346 --> 07:19.303
Ready?

07:19.995 --> 07:21.662
Let's go rob a bank.

07:24.508 --> 07:25.643
Basically,

07:25.645 --> 07:28.431
we assume the suspects will
hunt close to where they live,

07:28.468 --> 07:30.331
but far enough to remain anonymous.

07:30.447 --> 07:32.700
Each one of these data points
represents a bank that he hit,

07:32.725 --> 07:35.593
and this area where the lines intersect

07:35.725 --> 07:38.202
give us the best estimate
of the unsub's home.

07:38.255 --> 07:40.413
So, how many does that
narrow it down to?

07:41.748 --> 07:43.393
Couple hundred thousand.

07:44.218 --> 07:44.880
Oh.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.181
Witness statements.

07:48.906 --> 07:51.643
Not planning on seeing any of the
sights this afternoon, were you?

07:51.995 --> 07:54.572
I've already seen the Hollywood
sign, been to the Getty center,

07:54.588 --> 07:56.652
I'm not really interested
in John Wayne's footprints,

07:56.655 --> 07:59.352
so I guess that covers
the sights of Los Angeles.

07:59.766 --> 08:01.263
Let me guess, New York?

08:01.276 --> 08:02.643
Now, what would make you say that?

08:02.668 --> 08:05.123
Is this all the video
equipment you've got?

08:05.467 --> 08:06.633
That ain't Quantico.

08:06.648 --> 08:08.703
I need to set up a link
with our tech back there.

08:08.728 --> 08:11.313
We got another bay as crappy
as this one down the hall.

08:11.495 --> 08:13.943
- You all right?
- I just need some popcorn.

08:13.975 --> 08:15.123
Have fun.

08:17.756 --> 08:19.260
So, he enters

08:20.673 --> 08:22.724
and he walks right to this spot.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.786
Pulls his weapon out and shoots
into the ceiling right there.

08:29.088 --> 08:31.883
That gets everyone's attention,
let's them all know he's dead serious.

08:31.898 --> 08:33.173
Efficient.

08:33.184 --> 08:34.922
This is the best spot in the bank.

08:34.938 --> 08:37.602
I can see all the
tellers, the front door,

08:38.616 --> 08:40.523
and that's the back office over there.

08:41.707 --> 08:44.633
- So, he knew exactly where to go.
- He had been here before.

08:45.537 --> 08:46.683
Next.

08:46.698 --> 08:49.823
Next, he turns,

08:50.357 --> 08:53.653
<i>- aims the gun at the guard.
- Don't you even think about it!</i>

08:53.937 --> 08:54.900
<i>Back it up.</i>

08:54.915 --> 08:57.723
Disarms the guard and
handcuffs him to the base.

08:59.978 --> 09:01.280
So, where's the threat?

09:01.285 --> 09:04.101
The guard's disarmed and chained.
How's he a threat to the unsub?

09:04.326 --> 09:05.473
He isn't.

09:05.488 --> 09:07.771
Then why did he take
the time to assault?

09:08.175 --> 09:11.070
He's got control, he's
obviously got skills,

09:11.367 --> 09:13.143
the very thing that he
doesn't have is time.

09:13.155 --> 09:15.300
He didn't assault the guards
in the previous banks, why?

09:15.315 --> 09:17.793
What's changed? What's
different about this guard?

09:18.748 --> 09:20.512
Maybe this guard
reminded him of somebody.

09:20.528 --> 09:22.972
What were the guards in the
previous robberies wearing?

09:23.468 --> 09:24.692
Uniforms?

09:25.157 --> 09:26.422
Black suits.

09:27.145 --> 09:28.052
That's it.

09:28.438 --> 09:29.620
That's all.

09:32.466 --> 09:35.100
Our boy's efficient, he's determined.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.932
This ain't his first picnic.

09:36.975 --> 09:38.780
He's got his trade down cold.

09:38.788 --> 09:41.620
Something about a guy in uniform
triggers an emotional response.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.762
- Army?
- No

09:43.776 --> 09:46.000
Army, you're conditioned to
work with people. This guy,

09:46.015 --> 09:47.443
he don't trust anybody.

09:47.448 --> 09:48.613
Prison.

09:48.615 --> 09:50.663
Best trade school in the country.

09:52.208 --> 09:54.653
I got access to 4 bank
robberies with security footage.

09:54.658 --> 09:56.721
<i>- What do I get to do with them?
- You know your...</i>

09:56.736 --> 09:59.531
digital perspective whatever software?

09:59.598 --> 10:02.003
<i>- Digital perspective analysis rendering?
- Yeah.</i>

10:02.008 --> 10:04.260
Honey, not only do I know
it, I helped develop it.

10:04.366 --> 10:06.950
Good,'cause I want every
physical dimension of the unsub:

10:06.968 --> 10:09.863
Height, waist size, inseam,
everything that you can give me.

10:10.138 --> 10:12.922
Honey, if he opens his mouth, I'll
give you the length of his teeth.

10:13.006 --> 10:15.360
Just keep it clean and
don't call me honey.

10:18.848 --> 10:20.401
See anything interesting?

10:20.737 --> 10:22.070
Maybe.

10:22.978 --> 10:24.363
<i>He took his time,</i>

10:24.378 --> 10:25.963
<i>he looked at me,</i>

10:26.645 --> 10:28.272
<i>then he pointed his gun at me.</i>

10:28.286 --> 10:30.492
<i>And you were all naked at this point?</i>

10:31.475 --> 10:32.461
<i>Yes.</i>

10:33.806 --> 10:36.511
Bank manager's wife. She
stopped by to pick him up.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.103
They were going to celebrate
their son's 16th birthday.

10:39.127 --> 10:40.910
The son was with them?

10:40.928 --> 10:42.493
Daughter, too.

10:49.328 --> 10:50.780
He knows the kids are theirs?

10:50.807 --> 10:53.031
Witnesses said he checked
their wallets first.

10:53.048 --> 10:54.630
He would have seen their names.

10:54.777 --> 10:57.053
So, of all 13 people, he puts together

10:57.058 --> 11:00.731
woman in her 60's, guy in his 30's,
married couple in front of their kids.

11:01.596 --> 11:02.423
Why?

11:02.438 --> 11:05.372
Maybe they were the most inappropriate
couples he could think of.

11:06.476 --> 11:07.881
He's sadistic.

11:08.108 --> 11:10.243
Would explains why he brings them here.

11:10.255 --> 11:12.062
He could have taken them
behind the teller windows,

11:12.078 --> 11:14.500
he could have taken them back into
the vault, but he chooses here.

11:14.826 --> 11:16.992
It's the most exposed place in the bank.

11:19.027 --> 11:20.560
Like a stage.

11:21.275 --> 11:24.641
Like, it was as important for them to
see what was going on as it was for him.

11:24.925 --> 11:27.080
Public humiliation.

11:31.128 --> 11:33.003
I said, watch it!

11:37.148 --> 11:39.750
Robbery wasn't about the
money. It was about getting off

11:39.766 --> 11:42.521
on what he made these
people do on this spot.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.813
Forcing others to squirm and watch.

11:45.825 --> 11:48.233
We got to know what exactly
they were forced to do.

11:49.066 --> 11:50.683
We need to see the fantasy.

11:51.105 --> 11:53.153
Did you ever get a hold
of the security videos?

11:53.157 --> 11:55.481
Yes, but they were mostly erased.

11:58.876 --> 12:00.580
That's Henderson, the bank manager.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.021
Said he was so flustered
after what he had been through,

12:03.038 --> 12:05.100
that when he was
gathering the tapes for us,

12:05.118 --> 12:07.273
he hit the wrong buttons
and erased part of them.

12:07.965 --> 12:10.610
- You believe him?
- No. I told him I thought he was embarrassed

12:10.626 --> 12:12.891
about the tapes getting out
and he erased them on purpose.

12:12.908 --> 12:13.812
He denied it.

12:13.835 --> 12:16.243
You rule out the
possibility he was in on it?

12:16.285 --> 12:19.030
Why would he be involved in a robbery when
he had to go through something like that?

12:19.066 --> 12:22.783
Maybe he didn't know what was gonna
happen. Maybe he was betrayed by the unsub.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.402
Or perhaps he was coerced.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.350
There's been many
documented cases of robbers

12:26.365 --> 12:29.051
forcing bank managers to
assist them with their crimes.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.043
None of that is consistent with
the M.O.'S of the other robberies.

12:32.077 --> 12:34.103
Maybe there's a reason this last
one was different from the others.

12:34.147 --> 12:36.313
- A call from Quantico on one.
- Thanks.

12:36.545 --> 12:37.891
Garcia, it's Hotch.

12:37.906 --> 12:39.951
<i>Are we ready for something
completely weird?</i>

12:39.978 --> 12:43.031
<i>- How weird are we talking, Garcia?
- The security footage Hotch gave me,</i>

12:43.268 --> 12:45.991
<i>- I ran it through my software 3 times...
- and?</i>

12:46.008 --> 12:48.603
And there are weird height issues.

12:48.615 --> 12:52.043
i. e., the unsub in the first
three robberies is 6 foot 1

12:52.056 --> 12:55.650
and the unsub in the
last robbery, he's 5'10".

12:55.667 --> 12:58.011
So what? In the last robbery we're
dealing with a different unsub?

12:58.025 --> 13:00.301
An unsub who is somehow
able to erase tapes

13:00.317 --> 13:02.682
that show exactly what
happened at that bank.

13:02.696 --> 13:05.842
An unsub who may have
possibly had inside help.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.071
I think it's time we sit
down with the bank manager.

13:11.316 --> 13:13.551
Look, I already told the other agent

13:13.596 --> 13:16.501
that I was nervous. I screwed up.

13:17.837 --> 13:19.223
What else do you want me to say?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.921
It took you 9 minutes to call
911 after the robber left.

13:23.006 --> 13:26.052
I was collecting the tapes.
Before you called 911?

13:27.567 --> 13:28.950
You think I had something
to do with this?

13:30.007 --> 13:32.052
You think I'd put my
family through this?

13:32.327 --> 13:33.062
No.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.892
I don't think you'd put your family
through letting those tapes get out either.

13:42.786 --> 13:45.642
You were the only one who had
access to those tapes, mr. Henderson.

13:45.655 --> 13:48.001
Now, at best, you erased them
because you were embarrassed,

13:48.018 --> 13:50.340
and at worst, because you had
something to do with the robbery.

13:50.358 --> 13:52.412
Now, which would you
rather have us think?

13:53.648 --> 13:54.982
You got to understand.

13:55.038 --> 13:56.920
We were raised baptists.

13:57.326 --> 14:00.080
It's hard for us to talk
about this kind of thing.

14:00.986 --> 14:02.772
It's hard for all of us.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.533
The thought about anybody
seeing those tapes,

14:12.557 --> 14:14.352
even the police...

14:17.278 --> 14:18.023
No.

14:19.916 --> 14:21.190
I'm sorry.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.893
I'm sorry.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.122
I didn't think it would matter.

14:33.895 --> 14:35.983
I think it's pretty
clear what this is about.

14:37.048 --> 14:38.922
Shame and humiliation.

14:42.005 --> 14:43.421
<i>Everybody, down!</i>

14:43.926 --> 14:45.272
<i>I said, watch it!</i>

14:45.276 --> 14:46.921
<i>Watch it!</i>

14:49.721 --> 14:52.237
There is nothing wrong with my software.

14:53.808 --> 14:56.511
My software is perfect,

14:56.846 --> 14:59.110
isn't it? No, it isn't.

15:03.905 --> 15:05.973
Why must your beauty be so

15:06.357 --> 15:08.411
painful? God!

15:15.106 --> 15:17.323
<i>- Yeah?
- Pals, don't be ticked,</i>

15:17.337 --> 15:20.532
<i>but I think I may have missed the
sort of glaringly obvious here.</i>

15:20.887 --> 15:24.091
<i>How would you make yourself taller
without being a different person entirely</i>

15:24.096 --> 15:26.372
or having some sort of
weird chinese surgery?

15:26.388 --> 15:27.293
Heels.

15:27.305 --> 15:29.703
<i>Right, sunshine, but
would have seen heels,</i>

15:29.716 --> 15:32.562
<i>unless the unsub had them
hidden inside his shoe.</i>

15:32.577 --> 15:34.612
<i>The point is, lifts.
- Lifts.</i>

15:34.626 --> 15:36.620
Lifts, all hidden up inside his boot.

15:36.638 --> 15:40.623
<i>With a little fancy footwork,
pun emphatically intended,</i>

15:40.666 --> 15:42.441
Garcia here managed to dig him out.

15:42.496 --> 15:43.503
Thanks, girl.

15:44.406 --> 15:46.392
He's trying to throw us
off, hide his real height.

15:46.437 --> 15:48.911
But why would he take the lifts
out just for the last robbery?

15:48.935 --> 15:50.091
Maybe he's getting careless.

15:50.107 --> 15:52.032
Which means he's also
getting more dangerous.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.171
At least we know we're
only dealing with one unsub.

16:06.105 --> 16:09.283
Based on the knowledge that
spending a significant time in prison

16:09.297 --> 16:12.072
stunts emotional growth while
increasing professional skills,

16:12.418 --> 16:14.212
we can estimate this unsub went to jail

16:14.225 --> 16:16.340
between the ages of 18 and 22 and spent

16:16.355 --> 16:18.702
between 5 and 10 years inside.

16:23.557 --> 16:25.562
That puts him at the approximate age

16:25.577 --> 16:28.250
between 23 and 35.

16:28.277 --> 16:30.422
This guy's much more than
just a bank robber though.

16:30.798 --> 16:34.022
What started out as a practical
M.O., stripping his hostages,

16:34.398 --> 16:36.893
triggered a deep
psycho-sexual response.

16:37.007 --> 16:39.413
In other words, when he found himself
in front of a bunch of naked people

16:39.428 --> 16:41.581
under his control, he snapped,

16:41.936 --> 16:44.970
- then he decided to manipulate them.
- And better, or just getting worse,

16:45.158 --> 16:46.931
he's attacking banks earlier in the day

16:46.948 --> 16:48.640
when more and more people are present.

16:48.658 --> 16:52.042
This sounds like he's sacrificing the safety
of having just a few hostages to contain,

16:52.055 --> 16:54.423
for the satisfaction of having
more subjects to control.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.841
He'll be less interested
in money and more interested

16:56.857 --> 16:59.031
in sadistically
manipulating his captives.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.901
In all likelihood,
he'll be high on drugs.

17:05.777 --> 17:08.492
It would be wrong, however,
to write this guy off as crazy.

17:08.556 --> 17:10.132
Bank robbing is an ambitious crime

17:10.146 --> 17:12.262
and it takes time and
planning to pull it off.

17:12.275 --> 17:14.352
What makes this unsub unique

17:14.367 --> 17:16.760
is his fractured psyche.

17:17.305 --> 17:18.892
On the one hand,

17:19.077 --> 17:21.452
a cold, organized bank robber.

17:21.765 --> 17:23.050
On the other,

17:23.566 --> 17:25.869
a disorganized sexual sadist

17:25.944 --> 17:27.742
full of bottled up rage.

17:31.456 --> 17:32.702
<i>Freeze!</i>

17:32.815 --> 17:33.941
<i>Drop it!</i>

17:34.538 --> 17:36.352
<i>- No.
- Come on now,</i>

17:36.657 --> 17:38.312
<i>just put it down.</i>

17:40.645 --> 17:42.261
<i>I got a mac-10.</i>

17:42.346 --> 17:44.771
<i>One shot. You got one shot to kill me.</i>

17:47.016 --> 17:49.921
<i>Even if you kill me,
I'm going down shooting.</i>

18:05.235 --> 18:07.623
The two parts of his psyche have

18:07.997 --> 18:09.970
just begun to bleed together,

18:09.978 --> 18:12.093
now when they finally converge,

18:12.696 --> 18:14.593
we're talking about a criminal

18:14.747 --> 18:16.512
with the skills and efficiency

18:16.528 --> 18:18.551
of a master bank robber

18:18.757 --> 18:21.730
and the rage of a suicide bomber.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.572
He will explode.

18:45.315 --> 18:46.893
Take them off.

18:51.515 --> 18:55.482
- I said take them off.
- No.

18:55.727 --> 18:59.211
Take... them... off!

19:02.707 --> 19:03.652
Sir,

19:03.665 --> 19:06.070
bank robbery in progress. Corner
of Washington and Sepulveda.

19:06.088 --> 19:07.762
Kid in the back room
called 911 on his cell.

19:07.776 --> 19:10.291
Said the suspect's started
making people undress.

19:11.085 --> 19:14.611
<i>L.A. air 8, requesting immediate air
support, Washington and Sepulveda.</i>

19:37.297 --> 19:38.823
How far are we from the bank?

19:38.838 --> 19:41.741
- Without traffic, 10 minutes.
- Let's avoid traffic.

19:55.966 --> 19:58.452
Do I have everybody's attention?

20:09.098 --> 20:10.041
How we doing?

20:10.055 --> 20:12.221
- About 8 minutes.
- Make it 3.

20:26.327 --> 20:27.773
Please?

20:28.438 --> 20:29.853
Less than a mile.

20:31.118 --> 20:32.603
Just around the corner.

20:37.257 --> 20:38.561
Is this your bike?

20:57.418 --> 20:58.633
- Call E.M.S.!
- F.B.I.

20:58.647 --> 20:59.482
- He took off.
- Where?

20:59.495 --> 21:02.392
- I don't know.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, Can you hear me?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.992
- She's unconscious.
- Medics are on their way.

21:05.008 --> 21:06.871
Gideon, he may be headed your way.

21:06.888 --> 21:09.170
You know what the odds are of catching
a motorcycle with a car in L.A.?

21:09.187 --> 21:11.243
Try not to think about it.

21:14.576 --> 21:15.462
There.

21:18.388 --> 21:19.763
Damn it. Go.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.573
It's the first time he's
made so many mistakes.

22:46.888 --> 22:49.352
Hit the bank in the
morning, more people around.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.772
Didn't clear the back room,
parked his bike right out front.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.790
- Didn't bother taking any money.
- Did almost everything you predicted.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.712
Sometimes it sucks to be right.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.420
Witnesses said he refused
to take off his clothes.

23:03.246 --> 23:05.433
- Damn.
- That's enough.

23:09.687 --> 23:11.992
It's not the kind of
rage you bottle back up.

23:12.446 --> 23:14.563
This could be the beginning of a spree.

23:15.985 --> 23:18.021
How's JJ doing on that suspect list?

23:19.768 --> 23:22.860
I'll call her. I'll call Reid
and Elle and get them on it, too.

23:26.456 --> 23:28.150
You don't think he's
going to rob another bank?

23:28.636 --> 23:29.313
No.

23:30.358 --> 23:32.261
He doesn't care about money anymore.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.060
Whatever he's after,

23:35.387 --> 23:37.731
he'll hurt anyone who gets in his way.

23:58.668 --> 24:00.521
- You call Elle and Reid?
- Yeah.

24:02.036 --> 24:04.493
- What's that?
- My son's first steps.

24:04.537 --> 24:07.100
I was out of town and
Haley sent me the file.

24:07.377 --> 24:08.520
It's nice.

24:08.806 --> 24:11.820
It's 5 months ago. I haven't
loaded anything on here since.

24:12.828 --> 24:15.373
Okay. So you film a new
one when you get home.

24:19.928 --> 24:21.822
So, you're sure this is it?

24:21.855 --> 24:23.621
Yeah. Based on all the parameters,

24:23.656 --> 24:25.761
age, armed robbery charge,

24:25.777 --> 24:27.141
time spent in prison,

24:27.175 --> 24:29.170
approximate location
of home address based on

24:29.207 --> 24:30.743
geographical profile.

24:30.768 --> 24:32.863
It's about 360 names.

24:32.938 --> 24:35.632
these guys aren't sweethearts, but
there's only a handful with sex crimes

24:35.645 --> 24:38.232
on their rap sheets and
none are sexual sadists.

24:38.247 --> 24:41.790
That's not surprising. Bank robbers and
gun nuts aren't typically sex offenders.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.922
That's what makes this unsub unique.

24:43.938 --> 24:45.320
What about a pimp?

24:46.548 --> 24:49.132
Roland Lynch, 32 years old.

24:49.538 --> 24:51.762
Pimps are characteristically sociopathic

24:51.766 --> 24:53.560
and, in many cases, sadistic.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.553
Helps control their employees.

24:55.626 --> 24:57.873
Well, this one started out
robbing convenience stores

24:57.907 --> 24:59.703
before working his way into pimping.

24:59.887 --> 25:02.730
That's unusual. Pimps
typically violate by proxy,

25:02.757 --> 25:04.480
forcing others to do the
work for them, whereas,

25:04.497 --> 25:07.341
bank robbers usually
operate in pairs or alone.

25:07.355 --> 25:08.830
So, he's sexually sadistic

25:08.856 --> 25:11.112
and has experience with armed robbery.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.203
Along with fitting all other
parameters of the profile.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.963
All right. I'll get in touch
with his parole officer.

25:17.218 --> 25:20.271
You're Lynch's parole officer. When
was the last time you talked to him?

25:20.987 --> 25:22.693
Haven't talked to Lynch in a month.

25:22.927 --> 25:24.373
What can you tell us about him?

25:24.417 --> 25:25.271
Roland?

25:25.657 --> 25:27.112
A real peach.

25:27.325 --> 25:30.502
He used to punish his girls by raping
them in front of their little sisters.

25:32.608 --> 25:34.780
- He got a habit?
- Which one of mine doesn't?

25:34.995 --> 25:37.931
If I'm not mistaken, he probably
has about a 10 rock a day monkey.

25:38.026 --> 25:39.990
If Lynch is our guy,
he's going downhill fast,

25:40.005 --> 25:42.321
but if he's tweaking, he's
going down even faster.

25:42.705 --> 25:44.772
His latest drug test isn't back yet,

25:44.787 --> 25:46.662
but I'm betting it
isn't going to be clean.

25:46.775 --> 25:48.412
You got a line on him?

25:48.468 --> 25:51.013
Give me a break. You know
what my case load is like?

25:51.135 --> 25:52.260
Hey, come on, man.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.420
He might have beaten a
civilian to death with a mac-10,

25:54.435 --> 25:57.031
caved in a meter maid's face,
and that's just the beginning.

25:57.255 --> 25:58.901
That make the top of your list.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.652
- I'll make some calls.
- Thank you.

26:09.198 --> 26:10.873
F.B.I. I need Roland Lynch.

26:10.888 --> 26:13.391
talk to me, Roland Lynch. Roland lynch?

26:14.136 --> 26:15.982
- Hey! Roland Lynch?
- Quoi?

26:15.998 --> 26:17.922
Don't even think about it. Don't move!

26:17.926 --> 26:19.801
Give it to me. Give it to me.

26:23.638 --> 26:26.660
You know I can count about 16 different
ways you've just violated your parole.

26:26.827 --> 26:28.811
They send in feds for busting parole?

26:28.826 --> 26:31.870
We're here for the bank robberies
and the delivery man you killed.

26:32.505 --> 26:33.960
I don't rob banks.

26:33.975 --> 26:36.352
You violated parole, we've
got you on possession,

26:36.368 --> 26:37.611
you're going down.

26:37.616 --> 26:40.292
You think I'm gonna roll over'cause
you're waving 3 to 5 at me?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.291
I took beating's that
lasted longer than that.

26:42.308 --> 26:43.400
If i were you,

26:43.405 --> 26:45.680
I wouldn't even worry
about the murder charge.

26:45.696 --> 26:48.790
I'd worry what happens to you when
word gets around you're a pervert.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.702
Yeah, well, I made my
living being a pervert.

26:50.718 --> 26:52.963
You can tell them that.
Oh, this is different.

26:53.146 --> 26:56.010
Went after little old ladies, kids.

26:56.027 --> 26:59.231
Witnesses say you got off when
the old lady took her shirt off.

27:00.926 --> 27:03.492
Old ladies, kids,
inside, think about it.

27:05.028 --> 27:06.241
Hey, Roland,

27:06.365 --> 27:08.672
you're high out of your
mind right now, aren't you?

27:08.897 --> 27:10.970
- Get him in the car.
- Take him back to the field office,

27:10.985 --> 27:12.992
spend a few hours with
him, he'll sober up.

27:12.998 --> 27:16.041
Give me a pot of coffee and I'll go all
night with this fool. Get him out of here.

27:36.377 --> 27:38.351
<i>- Hey, Morgan.
- We got him.</i>

27:38.355 --> 27:40.051
<i>This guy's a hardcore prison rat.</i>

27:40.145 --> 27:41.582
- Elle.
- Hang on.

27:41.595 --> 27:43.781
We just got another call,
restaurant in the south bay.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.551
Guy came in in a ski-mask,
started making people undress.

27:46.555 --> 27:48.861
- He just shot a
14-year-old kid. - When?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.892
- 10 minutes ago.
- What'd she say?

27:50.897 --> 27:52.140
Hardcore or not,

27:52.158 --> 27:54.180
you've got the wrong scumbag.

27:59.551 --> 28:01.614
According to witnesses, he came in and

28:01.630 --> 28:03.414
fired into ceiling.

28:06.498 --> 28:09.064
He separated all the
kids from their parents.

28:18.879 --> 28:19.913
Then?

28:22.918 --> 28:25.304
He's forcing the sons
to hit their mothers.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.694
He started to.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.745
When he tried to get the first
one to hit his mother harder,

28:30.479 --> 28:32.166
he refused, and

28:32.409 --> 28:35.106
when he refused...

28:38.318 --> 28:40.654
it doesn't make sense. They're children.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.224
He's playing out a fantasy.

28:44.230 --> 28:46.883
Yeah, but it's his fantasy
and someone else's children.

28:47.261 --> 28:49.245
They're surrogates of some kind.

28:49.550 --> 28:51.014
No. You don't do this

28:51.211 --> 28:53.906
to someone else's kids to
get off. You just don't do it.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.764
It just doesn't make sense to me.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.826
You internalize violence. You
take it out on other people.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.364
Why force somebody else to do it?

29:11.369 --> 29:14.093
Why force children
to act out your rage?

29:15.049 --> 29:17.613
He didn't make the children
do anything at the bank.

29:18.571 --> 29:21.053
Manager said he put
the parents together.

29:21.299 --> 29:24.135
So, why is he so
focused on the kids now?

29:24.590 --> 29:27.036
I want to talk to the
bank manager again.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.223
I don't know what else I can tell
you. I've already gone over it 3 times.

29:36.018 --> 29:38.123
What we need to know is if
there's something in that tape

29:38.160 --> 29:40.074
that you don't want us to know about?

29:42.129 --> 29:45.055
There were 12 other people in
that bank who were forced to watch.

29:45.101 --> 29:47.193
What could I possibly be hiding?

29:53.740 --> 29:56.194
This is about your children, isn't it?

30:01.569 --> 30:03.045
We're sorry.

30:10.870 --> 30:12.046
Mr. Henderson,

30:12.188 --> 30:14.133
this is very important.

30:14.238 --> 30:17.253
He's already killed 2 people
and he's not going to stop.

30:20.341 --> 30:22.406
God! Go ahead.

30:22.810 --> 30:24.943
Why don't you tell
them what he did to us,

30:24.950 --> 30:27.054
what you let him do?

30:27.390 --> 30:28.814
He had a gun.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.323
He was going to kill me.

30:42.948 --> 30:44.225
Come on.

30:56.178 --> 30:58.295
They took my family from me.

31:01.849 --> 31:03.886
We can't even look
at each other anymore.

31:13.648 --> 31:16.035
I don't know how a family
gets over something like that.

31:16.498 --> 31:17.633
They don't.

31:18.051 --> 31:19.286
Excuse me.

31:22.190 --> 31:24.924
Is it true he would have killed my
father if he tried to stand up to him?

31:25.419 --> 31:28.483
There's no way to know, Darren,
but your father did the right thing.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.153
Is there some reason you doubt that?

31:33.248 --> 31:34.583
It's just...

31:35.508 --> 31:37.623
the robber said something afterwards.

31:39.839 --> 31:41.334
He said he was sorry.

31:47.111 --> 31:48.924
He apologized.

31:49.130 --> 31:51.384
Sadists don't apologize.
They gloat, maybe,

31:51.409 --> 31:54.216
- but they don't apologize.
- Our guy's not a sadist.

31:54.251 --> 31:56.685
We got that part of the profile wrong.

31:56.691 --> 32:00.036
He doesn't derive any sadistic
pleasure from these fantasies,

32:00.961 --> 32:02.876
they're more like a compulsion.

32:02.910 --> 32:04.714
Compulsion that's
literally life or death?

32:04.739 --> 32:06.973
I mean, if anyone
interferes, he kills them.

32:07.071 --> 32:09.103
It's like he's compelled
to direct these fantasies

32:09.118 --> 32:10.854
using these people as actors.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.784
Actors on a stage, it's a play.

32:12.799 --> 32:14.586
It's a psychodrama.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.643
What's that?

32:17.660 --> 32:20.246
It's a form of psychotherapy
whereby actors serve as surrogates

32:20.260 --> 32:22.314
for actual people in the patient's life.

32:22.328 --> 32:25.284
Incorporates many elements of
theatre, including an audience.

32:25.390 --> 32:28.376
There's a very famous pilot program
at the San Luis Obispo county jail

32:28.391 --> 32:29.534
in the mid-nineties.

32:29.551 --> 32:32.074
Isn't that just a couple
hours away from here?

32:32.090 --> 32:34.214
Let's go over the suspect
list and see how many of them

32:34.228 --> 32:36.424
did time in San Luis Obispo.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.086
The answer is 4.

32:38.098 --> 32:40.315
<i>Come on. Tell me you narrowed
it down a little more than that.</i>

32:40.320 --> 32:43.055
Only two live in state,
but only 1 lives in L.A.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.764
Ha, that a girl.

32:44.780 --> 32:46.664
Caleb Dale Sheppard, last known address

32:46.678 --> 32:49.425
- 236 Harbor Lane, Inglewood.
- Thanks, mama.

32:49.441 --> 32:52.436
That's only 1.6 miles from the
last restaurant that he hit.

32:53.468 --> 32:55.255
I've been studying a lot of L.A. Maps.

32:55.259 --> 32:57.866
If he's been attacking that close
to home, he's given up any interest

32:57.878 --> 32:59.235
in protecting his identity.

32:59.249 --> 33:01.633
We need to all go down there and
split up, half to his address,

33:01.638 --> 33:04.664
half patrol in the area around the
restaurant in case he's on the hunt.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.674
Mrs. Sheppard, do you
know where your son is?

33:36.909 --> 33:38.873
Dale doesn't live here anymore.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.945
Where is he, mrs. Sheppard?

33:41.358 --> 33:42.993
He's a grown man.

33:44.268 --> 33:46.972
You have any idea how much
trouble your son could be in?

33:47.217 --> 33:48.225
Jail?

33:48.640 --> 33:50.015
He's a good boy.

33:50.419 --> 33:51.993
Lost his way a bit, that's all.

33:52.009 --> 33:54.603
Well, that's one way to look at
12 years in and out of prison.

33:55.170 --> 33:56.704
You've never made a mistake?

33:57.538 --> 33:59.623
Your son spent time in a juvenile home?

34:00.598 --> 34:02.074
He was out of control,

34:02.670 --> 34:04.524
even attacked his own sister once,

34:05.079 --> 34:06.504
but his father died.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.233
It wasn't his fault.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.522
Was it yours?

34:10.397 --> 34:11.652
What?

34:12.139 --> 34:13.675
Was it your fault?

34:16.889 --> 34:19.172
How many of these did you
take today, mrs. Sheppard?

34:19.639 --> 34:20.764
I had...

34:21.268 --> 34:23.355
back problems my whole life.

34:28.407 --> 34:30.194
She's completely out of her mind.

34:30.647 --> 34:33.152
She's so lonely she'll
just keep talking to us.

34:33.547 --> 34:35.415
I doubt she'll tell us where he is.

34:35.429 --> 34:37.764
That was Garcia. Apparently
Sheppard's sister died

34:37.779 --> 34:39.205
12 years ago,

34:39.246 --> 34:40.695
suicide.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.902
Lady sure did a number on her kids.

34:44.797 --> 34:47.885
She's probably lonely after the
husband died and on painkillers,

34:47.900 --> 34:49.242
not in her right mind, and

34:49.257 --> 34:51.623
nobody there to turn to
but Sheppard and his sister.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.263
So, now he's symbolically
punishing his mother?

34:54.277 --> 34:56.062
He's playing out a fantasy.

34:56.308 --> 34:59.044
Sons gaining total
control over their mothers.

34:59.278 --> 35:00.692
We got something.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.775
"Dale daybreak hotel."

35:24.150 --> 35:25.204
Sheppard,

35:25.598 --> 35:27.663
- F.B.I.
- Key?

35:28.497 --> 35:29.984
No, I got one.

35:39.369 --> 35:40.503
Clear!

35:41.108 --> 35:43.823
Yeah, it's clear here, too.

35:55.267 --> 35:57.545
Morgan. Crystal meth.

35:59.248 --> 36:01.195
Oh, he's got to be halfway
out of his mind by now.

36:01.207 --> 36:03.335
Which would explain
why he left this behind.

36:09.848 --> 36:12.093
Well, it looks like he's
on foot. Here's his bike.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.373
I'm calling Hotch.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.044
<i>- Yeah?
- Look, he's not here.</i>

36:31.300 --> 36:32.733
From the looks of it, he just left.

36:32.748 --> 36:34.203
<i>Hotch, he's tweaking.</i>

36:34.217 --> 36:35.963
<i>He's unmasked and he's probably on foot.</i>

36:35.968 --> 36:38.194
All right, stay there. Call
if there's any sign of him.

36:38.210 --> 36:39.102
Okay. You Too.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.445
If he's on foot, he must
still be in the neighborhood.

36:41.650 --> 36:43.105
How do we find him?

36:43.118 --> 36:46.124
At this point, he'll probably hit the
first thing that catches his attention.

36:46.279 --> 36:48.312
- Families.
- A public place.

36:48.328 --> 36:50.943
If the trend continues, he'll
look for a bigger audience.

36:50.957 --> 36:52.434
Public place with families.

36:52.447 --> 36:54.222
Guys, there's a public
park not far from here.

36:54.230 --> 36:56.133
- Where?
- . 6 miles from where we are now.

36:56.139 --> 36:58.132
. 9 miles from the hotel
where the unsub's staying,

36:58.137 --> 37:00.805
which we'll actually pass if we
take a right at the next light.

37:34.859 --> 37:36.595
There's no sign of him.

37:39.428 --> 37:41.713
We've got cruisers
everywhere. Where could he be?

37:41.789 --> 37:44.372
There's only a few blocks
between here and his hotel.

37:45.019 --> 37:46.762
He's got to be really close.

38:12.889 --> 38:14.492
- Do it.
- No.

38:15.190 --> 38:17.354
- I said, do it.
- No.

38:17.437 --> 38:19.202
- Do it.
- It's okay.

38:19.220 --> 38:21.334
- Come on, you can do it.
- No, no.

38:21.350 --> 38:23.574
Please, just do what he says, please.

38:23.590 --> 38:25.692
- I said do it!
- Please, do what he says.

38:26.297 --> 38:27.934
It's ok, sweetheart.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.705
Mommy says it's ok.

38:33.867 --> 38:34.974
Put it down.

38:36.369 --> 38:37.384
Drop the knife.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.545
It won't fix you, Sheppard.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.354
It doesn't matter what you make them do,

38:41.357 --> 38:43.545
how many people are watching you.

38:48.617 --> 38:51.032
- Oh, my God.
- Got him.

38:52.238 --> 38:54.072
It's okay, baby.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.493
Look at these people. Look at them!

39:01.019 --> 39:02.632
They're children.

39:02.789 --> 39:05.083
They're children, for god's sake.

39:12.957 --> 39:14.623
I need something that kills.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.714
Give me something. I need something.

39:19.259 --> 39:20.303
You shot me!

39:20.310 --> 39:22.403
You had a hunting knife
to a little boy's throat.

39:22.419 --> 39:24.742
Just give me something for the pain,

39:24.758 --> 39:26.255
you son of a bitch!

39:28.777 --> 39:30.852
- She did it!
- Who did?

39:30.937 --> 39:32.255
My mom.

39:32.380 --> 39:33.735
You don't know what she did to me.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.984
Did you really think you were
going to get back at your mom

39:36.000 --> 39:37.595
by attacking all these other people?

39:37.608 --> 39:39.295
The bitch deserved it.

39:39.309 --> 39:41.923
Except you didn't go after her, you
went after all these other women.

39:41.938 --> 39:43.735
- So what?
- You went after children.

39:43.738 --> 39:45.505
They're gonna have to
learn sooner or later.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.435
What are they going to have to
learn? That no one's there for you.

39:50.108 --> 39:52.894
He's a drug addict. He's detoxing.
I don't care what he asks for.

39:52.907 --> 39:54.943
- Don't give him anything.
- Come on.

39:55.789 --> 39:57.572
He's not a doctor.

39:57.587 --> 40:01.372
He's right. I'm an F.B.I. agent, and
he killed a 14-year-old boy today.

40:14.907 --> 40:16.074
<i>"The basis of shame</i>

40:16.089 --> 40:18.554
<i>is not some personal mistake of ours,</i>

40:18.658 --> 40:21.653
<i>but that this humiliation
is seen by everyone."</i>

40:22.650 --> 40:24.384
<i>Milan Kundera.</i>

40:40.857 --> 40:42.142
You okay?

40:42.659 --> 40:45.623
I was showing those trainees
around the offices the other day.

40:45.639 --> 40:47.852
They all want to be in the BAU.

40:49.649 --> 40:51.614
I told them what a great job it is.

40:52.998 --> 40:56.313
And they even applauded
when the tour was over.

40:58.338 --> 40:59.644
I heard.

40:59.687 --> 41:01.324
Yeah, but I didn't really
tell them the truth.

41:01.339 --> 41:04.002
I didn't tell them what it's like
to spend your days in this hell.

41:04.719 --> 41:06.255
It's fun, huh?

41:06.870 --> 41:09.582
I mean, who's to blame for
somebody like Sheppard?

41:10.768 --> 41:11.885
His mother?

41:12.040 --> 41:13.383
Broken home?

41:14.110 --> 41:16.675
Society? All of it? None of it?

41:18.900 --> 41:21.234
It gets worse and worse with each case.

41:22.790 --> 41:25.292
Save one life, we save the world.

41:27.149 --> 41:28.362
Yeah.

41:31.718 --> 41:33.932
Well, the one thing I
didn't tell the trainees.

41:34.168 --> 41:36.933
- What's that?
- We do not get paid enough.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.505
