00:27.440 --> 00:30.443
(Hiccup)
<i>This changes everything.</i>

00:45.041 --> 00:46.584
(grunting)

00:46.668 --> 00:49.796
- Meal time, maggots.
- (man) Over here!

00:49.879 --> 00:52.298
(men groaning)

00:55.885 --> 00:57.637
But that's not bread!

00:57.720 --> 01:00.015
Why does he always
get special treatment?

01:00.098 --> 01:04.227
Oh, Mr. Big Shot!
Mr. Berserker Chief.

01:04.310 --> 01:07.063
Oh, hey, you want some?

01:07.147 --> 01:08.940
Come here,
I'll give you some.

01:09.024 --> 01:11.317
(man)
Spare me a morsel!

01:11.400 --> 01:12.902
Oh!

01:12.986 --> 01:14.821
I've been meaning
to tell you something

01:14.904 --> 01:16.906
for the last three years.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.992
Your voice

01:19.075 --> 01:21.327
is really annoying!

01:21.410 --> 01:23.205
Ah!

01:23.287 --> 01:26.208
- (cracks neck)
- Gosh, that feels good.

01:27.834 --> 01:30.586
(chuckling)

01:30.670 --> 01:33.631
Huh? Ah. Oh!

01:33.715 --> 01:36.759
A woolly igloo?
Where'd you hear that?

01:37.802 --> 01:39.554
He's escaped!
Dagur's got out!

01:39.637 --> 01:40.930
(groans)

01:41.014 --> 01:42.515
Sound the alarm...

01:42.598 --> 01:44.893
- (all shouting)
- Oh, goody.

01:44.976 --> 01:47.562
A challenge!
Ahhh!

01:52.859 --> 01:55.444
- Get him, Dagur!
- Show 'em who's boss!

02:01.993 --> 02:04.370
Oh, that's not good.

02:04.453 --> 02:06.289
- Ha ha!
- Ooh!

02:06.372 --> 02:07.874
(whistling)

02:07.957 --> 02:09.625
No, no, Dagur, don't!

02:09.709 --> 02:11.878
I'm the one
that gave you the key.

02:11.961 --> 02:15.631
Which makes you traitor.

02:15.715 --> 02:16.758
(chuckles)

02:18.176 --> 02:19.385
I hate traitors.

02:19.468 --> 02:21.470
(grunts)

02:25.058 --> 02:25.975
(man)
Dagur!

02:27.102 --> 02:29.604
It's a new day, Hiccup.

02:29.687 --> 02:33.399
(laughs)
Hope you're well rested.

02:34.483 --> 02:37.070
(lightly roaring)

02:43.492 --> 02:46.037
Okay, bud,
let's try the new move.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.166
Ah-hooo!

02:50.250 --> 02:52.252
Yeah, baby!

02:52.335 --> 02:54.462
That's it, Toothless! Push it.

02:54.545 --> 02:56.380
You've got it! Climb higher.

02:56.464 --> 02:58.967
Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

02:59.050 --> 03:01.344
- (belt unlatching)
- What the... Oh, no, not again!

03:01.427 --> 03:04.347
Uh, hey, Toothless!

03:07.100 --> 03:08.851
- Hey.
- (growls)

03:08.935 --> 03:11.854
So just plummet,
or, uh... any ideas?

03:13.815 --> 03:15.942
I seriously have to
get my own pair of wings.

03:16.025 --> 03:17.860
- (grumbles)
- Oh, quiet, you.

03:17.944 --> 03:19.654
Don't even start.

03:21.197 --> 03:24.659
(Hiccup)
<i>This is Berk.</i>

03:24.742 --> 03:27.036
<i>This is Berk too.</i>

03:27.120 --> 03:28.746
<i>And so is this.</i>

03:28.830 --> 03:30.456
(munching)

03:30.539 --> 03:31.666
<i>And this also.</i>

03:32.917 --> 03:34.836
<i>Yeah, it's been</i>
<i>three whole years</i>

03:34.919 --> 03:36.838
<i>since the war</i>
<i>with the Berserkers.</i>

03:36.921 --> 03:38.547
<i>And Berk has changed a lot.</i>

03:38.631 --> 03:40.466
<i>But then again, so have we.</i>

03:40.549 --> 03:42.302
<i>Snotlout works</i>
<i>at the armory now.</i>

03:42.385 --> 03:46.597
<i>Gobber gave him the title</i>
<i>of "official weapons tester."</i>

03:46.681 --> 03:49.267
Ha ha ha! It works!

03:49.351 --> 03:52.603
<i>The twins, to absolutely</i>
<i>no one's surprise,</i>

03:52.687 --> 03:55.106
<i>have decided to dedicate</i>
<i>their lives to Loki...</i>

03:55.190 --> 03:57.359
Uh, Hookfang!
Hookfang!

03:57.441 --> 04:00.028
<i>...the god of pranks.</i>
<i>Lucky us.</i>

04:00.111 --> 04:02.947
You just have to
cut it that close, don't you?

04:03.031 --> 04:04.240
Hookfang!

04:05.574 --> 04:07.702
There will be
repercussions for this.

04:07.785 --> 04:09.745
- Repercussions!
- Yes!

04:09.829 --> 04:11.747
(Hiccup)
<i>And then there's Fishlegs</i>,

04:11.831 --> 04:13.457
<i>who has really found his calling,</i>

04:13.541 --> 04:15.501
<i>teaching the children of Berk</i>

04:15.584 --> 04:17.003
<i>the history of dragons.</i>

04:17.086 --> 04:19.839
And if you look closely
at the walls of the Great Hall,

04:19.922 --> 04:22.007
you'll still see puncture marks

04:22.091 --> 04:24.010
where the Speed Stingers attacked.

04:24.093 --> 04:26.470
Interesting fact
about these dragons...

04:26.554 --> 04:29.265
Oh! Oh, look, kids!
We're in luck.

04:29.349 --> 04:31.684
Here come two of Berk's
most famous heroes.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.102
Ho ho! Heroes?

04:33.186 --> 04:34.812
I've got some chiefing to do,

04:34.896 --> 04:36.564
but I guess I could spare a moment...

04:36.647 --> 04:39.067
Hiccup and the amazing Toothless!

04:39.150 --> 04:41.069
(kids cheering)

04:41.152 --> 04:43.279
...eh, to introduce my son

04:43.363 --> 04:45.865
and his Night Fury!
Ha ha ha! Hooray.

04:45.948 --> 04:48.117
(all cheering)

04:49.535 --> 04:51.871
- (dragon barks)
- Hey, there you are.

04:51.954 --> 04:54.374
Hiccup, I've been
chasing you since the armory.

04:54.457 --> 04:56.918
Well, I thought we'd
try out the far north today.

04:57.001 --> 04:59.087
Uh, can we talk
about something first?

04:59.170 --> 05:01.505
Yeah, sure,
if you can catch me.

05:01.589 --> 05:03.507
(Toothless roars)

05:03.591 --> 05:05.509
(Hiccup)
You know what? I'm just gonna say it.

05:05.593 --> 05:07.636
I have a really good feeling
about today, Astrid.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.639
You say that every time
we go searching for new dragons.

05:10.723 --> 05:12.767
Hiccup, while we have a second,

05:12.850 --> 05:14.310
I wanted to talk to you about...

05:14.394 --> 05:15.811
Oh, look, look, look, look!
You see it?

05:15.895 --> 05:17.397
There's definitely
some movement up ahead.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.191
Long neck, large head.
Behind that rock formation.

05:20.275 --> 05:23.027
Yeah, anyway,
I wanted to tell you...

05:23.111 --> 05:24.153
Ugh!

05:24.237 --> 05:25.947
This is it, Toothless.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.241
A new species of dragon, bud.

05:28.324 --> 05:29.575
(growls)

05:30.910 --> 05:32.620
- Loki'd!
- Loki'd!

05:32.703 --> 05:35.123
Ha! You totally thought
"Barch" was a new dragon.

05:35.206 --> 05:36.958
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh, come on.

05:37.041 --> 05:39.752
Did not. Let's go, bud.

05:39.835 --> 05:43.506
Wow. Who yakked in his mutton?

05:47.551 --> 05:50.596
(grunting, purring)

05:58.396 --> 06:00.815
Hiccup,
those guys are muttonheads.

06:00.898 --> 06:02.442
But you have to admit,

06:02.525 --> 06:06.028
we've visited every island,
every sea stack,

06:06.112 --> 06:08.948
and every rock
in the archipelago twice.

06:09.031 --> 06:12.034
And we haven't spotted
a new dragon in a long time.

06:12.118 --> 06:14.412
This can't be all there is.

06:14.496 --> 06:16.747
There has to be
something more out there.

06:16.831 --> 06:18.541
What if there isn't, Hiccup?

06:18.624 --> 06:19.875
What if we're done?

06:19.959 --> 06:21.836
What if the search is over?

06:21.919 --> 06:23.171
It can't be.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.882
(sighs)
Well, it's over for me.

06:26.966 --> 06:29.427
I've been trying to tell you.

06:29.511 --> 06:32.972
Stormfly and I,
we're joining the Berk Guard.

06:33.055 --> 06:35.350
Oh.

06:35.433 --> 06:39.020
That's great.
I'm happy for you guys.

06:41.564 --> 06:44.650
Look, maybe you should
give some thought

06:44.733 --> 06:48.112
to what's next
for you and Toothless.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.535
(grunts)

06:57.497 --> 07:00.291
(bird hooting)

07:07.507 --> 07:10.176
I guess it's just
you and me from now on, bud.

07:10.259 --> 07:12.261
(groans)

07:18.476 --> 07:20.769
(grunting)
Oh, come on.

07:20.853 --> 07:22.771
Mulch, I can't get it!

07:22.855 --> 07:24.648
What's the problem, Bucket?

07:24.732 --> 07:26.359
I'm not sure, Mulch.

07:26.442 --> 07:29.195
I can't raise the net.
Something's pulling at it.

07:29.278 --> 07:30.988
Do you think...

07:31.072 --> 07:32.990
(both)
Sea monster!

07:34.450 --> 07:36.369
(both)
Whoa!

07:36.452 --> 07:38.662
(both)
Loki'd!

07:38.746 --> 07:41.874
Gah, you... Johann?

07:41.957 --> 07:43.709
Help me.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.129
Aw, man, you should have seen
the looks on your faces. Priceless.

07:47.213 --> 07:48.089
(both) Full Loki.

07:48.172 --> 07:50.341
Bet you never saw
a full Loki coming,

07:50.425 --> 07:52.176
am I right, Johann?

07:52.260 --> 07:54.929
- Johann?
- (spits)

07:55.846 --> 07:56.931
(door opens)

07:57.014 --> 07:59.850
Hiccup, what are you
doing home so early?

07:59.934 --> 08:03.062
Oh, I just...

08:03.145 --> 08:06.941
wanted to spend some time
with my dear old dad.

08:07.024 --> 08:08.943
Yeah, you know,
we never get to talk anymore.

08:09.026 --> 08:10.194
So...

08:11.153 --> 08:12.530
All right, what is it?

08:12.614 --> 08:13.864
What's what? "What is it?"

08:13.948 --> 08:16.534
Can't a son spend some quality time
with his father?

08:16.618 --> 08:19.036
Not this one.
Not usually, at least.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.413
So let's hear it.

08:20.496 --> 08:22.873
(sighs)
All right.

08:22.957 --> 08:25.460
Did you know Astrid
just joined the Berk Guard?

08:25.543 --> 08:27.753
I'd heard that.
Good for her.

08:27.836 --> 08:30.005
And the other riders have got
their different things going on.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.507
What are you saying, son?

08:31.591 --> 08:33.426
I'm saying, I don't know.

08:33.509 --> 08:35.177
Maybe it's time for me...

08:35.303 --> 08:37.011
- (moaning)
- Johann!

08:37.096 --> 08:38.431
What happened to you?

08:38.514 --> 08:40.390
Ooh, Dagur!

08:40.475 --> 08:41.850
What about Dagur?

08:41.933 --> 08:43.059
He's out.

08:43.144 --> 08:44.853
He's more Berserk than ever.

08:44.937 --> 08:48.732
And from the way
he was talking, Hiccup...

08:48.816 --> 08:51.653
you're number one on his revenge list.

08:51.735 --> 08:53.737
Ohh!

08:57.700 --> 09:00.119
All we go out of Johann
before he passed out

09:00.202 --> 09:02.622
was this: Dagur escaped
from Outcast Island

09:02.705 --> 09:04.206
by commandeering his ship.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.542
He threw Johann overboard about here.

09:06.626 --> 09:08.043
(Snotlout)
So what you're saying is

09:08.127 --> 09:10.212
Dagur could be anywhere by now.

09:10.296 --> 09:12.590
Well, technically, yes.

09:12.674 --> 09:14.300
Oh, great! Great, great, great.

09:14.383 --> 09:16.093
So that just leaves...
I don't know,

09:16.177 --> 09:19.096
let me think about this...
the entire ocean to search!

09:19.180 --> 09:20.931
- No, thank you.
- Master Hiccup.

09:21.015 --> 09:22.350
Johann, you're awake.

09:22.433 --> 09:25.728
And feeling much better.
Thank you for asking.

09:25.811 --> 09:28.731
More importantly, I have
more than a strong suspicion

09:28.814 --> 09:31.693
where our nefarious foe
may be heading.

09:31.775 --> 09:34.111
- (chuckles)
- Outside the archipelago?

09:34.195 --> 09:37.573
No! Just inside the fog bank
on our outer group of islands.

09:37.657 --> 09:39.074
We've never been out that far.

09:39.158 --> 09:41.160
When Dagur commandeered
my precious ship,

09:41.243 --> 09:43.829
he also came into possession
of a very important map...

09:43.912 --> 09:45.914
one that leads
to a graveyard of ships

09:45.998 --> 09:48.167
- hidden in that fog bank.
- (Snotlout) Wow!

09:48.250 --> 09:51.504
- That's the first place I'd go.
- If I may be allowed to finish?

09:51.587 --> 09:53.339
Johann, last time
we allowed you to finish,

09:53.422 --> 09:55.174
we ended up on Breakneck Bog.

09:55.257 --> 09:56.925
- So, no... No finishing.
- (Hiccup) Enough!

09:57.009 --> 09:58.678
What's so special
about the graveyard

09:58.761 --> 10:00.221
and why would he go there?

10:00.304 --> 10:02.473
- Well, you see...
- The short version, please.

10:03.683 --> 10:06.310
It's where I store
all my treasures and wares.

10:07.811 --> 10:10.398
Wow, concise, to the point.
Who knew he had it in him?

10:10.481 --> 10:12.149
(Johann) Which reminds me
of the first time

10:12.233 --> 10:15.236
I was labeled as "concise"!
He was a young man,

10:15.319 --> 10:17.071
- very ugly, I actually...
- Johann.

10:17.154 --> 10:18.740
- Yes?
- Focus. Is there anything else?

10:18.822 --> 10:20.658
As a matter of fact,
there is one ship

10:20.742 --> 10:22.951
you must avoid at all cost.

10:23.035 --> 10:25.580
It's called... the Reaper.

10:26.706 --> 10:29.458
Riddled with booby traps
from stem to stern.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.043
Barely made it out with my life

10:31.126 --> 10:33.254
the only time I dared venture aboard.

10:33.337 --> 10:34.756
Oh, wow!

10:34.838 --> 10:36.591
Okay, Toothless, let's go.
Unless, of course,

10:36.674 --> 10:39.176
any of you can make time
out of your busy schedules

10:39.260 --> 10:41.763
to capture a dangerous maniac?

10:52.022 --> 10:54.983
- This is pretty great, huh, bud?
- (growls)

10:56.485 --> 10:58.571
Seems like forever
since we all flew as a group.

10:58.654 --> 11:00.489
Let's see how rusty they are.

11:00.573 --> 11:02.450
V formation!

11:02.533 --> 11:04.993
Not bad.
Diamond formation!

11:05.077 --> 11:08.623
How rusty does this guy
think we are?

11:08.706 --> 11:13.210
Uh, guys, little tight
on the diamond, aren't we?

11:13.294 --> 11:16.255
(chuckles)
Just like old times.

11:17.757 --> 11:21.009
5,000 pounds of flaming muscle
coming through!

11:21.093 --> 11:22.886
Ever a class act.

11:29.935 --> 11:32.855
I knew it.
I knew there was more.

11:32.938 --> 11:34.315
Some of these ships?

11:34.398 --> 11:36.609
I've never seen anything
like them before.

11:36.692 --> 11:38.319
Okay, everybody fan out.

11:38.402 --> 11:40.863
If you see any trace of Dagur,
send a signal.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.281
(growls)

11:42.364 --> 11:44.074
It's all right, Stormfly.

11:44.158 --> 11:46.494
Nothing to worry about.

11:48.412 --> 11:51.123
(growling)

11:51.206 --> 11:52.958
Don't be nervous, girl.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.210
We don't want you to...

11:55.294 --> 11:56.796
do that. Ugh!

12:00.466 --> 12:04.011
Ha! Hookfang, these guys
were awful sailors.

12:04.094 --> 12:06.013
Ha ha! Oh!
A little help here.

12:06.096 --> 12:08.599
Hookfang! Hey!
I saw that look!

12:08.683 --> 12:10.142
What did we talk about?

12:19.819 --> 12:21.737
That's got to be the Reaper.

12:25.658 --> 12:27.535
(Hiccup) No sign of Dagur.

12:27.618 --> 12:29.495
Looks like we got here first.

12:29.578 --> 12:31.330
- What's the plan?
- We wait.

12:31.413 --> 12:32.956
Wait... Wait a minute.
For how long?

12:33.040 --> 12:35.584
This fog really gives
Meatlug the willies.

12:35.668 --> 12:38.379
He has a point.
We can't wait around here forever.

12:38.462 --> 12:40.548
We can't just leave
Johann's treasures here either.

12:40.631 --> 12:41.841
Dagur will steal them.

12:41.924 --> 12:44.051
And use the profits
to build a new armada.

12:44.134 --> 12:46.053
Not if we steal them first.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.763
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

12:47.847 --> 12:49.139
I hereby disown you!

12:49.223 --> 12:51.099
Actually, you know what?
I sort of like it.

12:51.183 --> 12:52.518
Welcome back to the family.

12:52.601 --> 12:54.311
Here's the plan:
we search the ships,

12:54.395 --> 12:56.898
gather up Johann's treasure,
and take it back to Berk.

12:56.980 --> 12:58.566
But keep your eyes open for Dagur.

12:58.649 --> 12:59.942
He could show up at any time.

13:00.025 --> 13:02.904
- (hissing)
- What is that?

13:02.986 --> 13:04.739
Eh, has Dagur's voice changed?

13:05.489 --> 13:07.324
Eels! Everybody,
get to your dragons

13:07.408 --> 13:09.284
before they get spooked
and take off!

13:09.368 --> 13:11.871
Ooh, hold me, Meatlug!

13:11.954 --> 13:14.206
- Hookfang!
- Stormfly!

13:14.289 --> 13:17.167
- (Snotlout screaming)
- (growling)

13:17.251 --> 13:19.712
Calm down, bud.
It's only a couple of eels.

13:19.795 --> 13:22.464
Really big, screaming, mean eels.

13:24.592 --> 13:25.968
(all grunting)

13:26.051 --> 13:28.387
The eels are pulling the ship down!

13:28.470 --> 13:30.055
(all grunt)

13:30.138 --> 13:31.933
Fishlegs, grab my foot!

13:32.015 --> 13:34.435
Oh, you ate a full breakfast.
You ate everybody's breakfast.

13:34.518 --> 13:36.520
We're gonna live!

13:36.604 --> 13:39.398
- Hold it... Aah!
- Astrid! No!

13:39.481 --> 13:42.067
- Most of us are gonna live!
- Hiccup!

13:58.375 --> 14:00.210
Thanks, Hiccup.

14:00.294 --> 14:02.004
Pardon me,
does anyone else think

14:02.087 --> 14:03.839
that Johann could have
warned us about...

14:03.923 --> 14:06.341
I don't know,
the giant screaming eels?!

14:06.425 --> 14:07.843
Snotlout, would you relax?

14:07.927 --> 14:09.219
The dragons will be back.

14:09.303 --> 14:11.221
In the meantime,
we stick with the plan.

14:11.305 --> 14:14.141
We find Johann's treasure, quietly.

14:17.102 --> 14:19.146
(sighs)

14:21.440 --> 14:23.567
Why are you staring at that ship?

14:23.651 --> 14:26.153
Because I'm thinking
of checking it out.

14:26.236 --> 14:29.364
The Reaper? The ship
Johann warned us about?

14:29.448 --> 14:31.742
Exactly. A ship
covered with booby traps

14:31.826 --> 14:33.160
from step to stern.

14:33.243 --> 14:35.078
I'm thinking, what is on there

14:35.162 --> 14:37.456
they don't want people to find?

14:41.627 --> 14:44.964
This boat is definitely
not from the archipelago.

14:45.047 --> 14:47.675
These carvings,
the design on the sail...

14:47.758 --> 14:49.760
I've never seen anything like this.

14:51.094 --> 14:52.346
And this metal.

14:52.429 --> 14:54.723
(sniffs, grunts)

14:54.807 --> 14:57.059
Come on, bud,
it's just an empty cage.

14:57.142 --> 14:59.061
(both)
Ah!

15:00.228 --> 15:01.063
(groans)

15:01.146 --> 15:03.858
Okay, now...
Now it's an empty cage.

15:03.941 --> 15:06.610
(Tuffnut)
Jewels, jewels!

15:06.694 --> 15:08.195
You know what
we're going to do?

15:08.278 --> 15:09.822
We're bringing them back
for the family.

15:09.905 --> 15:11.657
Mom will be so happy.

15:11.740 --> 15:15.494
Wait, but how are we
going to carry all these back to Berk?

15:15.577 --> 15:17.496
(gasps)
Great idea, sis!

15:17.579 --> 15:19.331
I can't believe
I didn't think about that.

15:19.414 --> 15:20.958
Here, I may do it too.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.377
I'm also gonna put jewels
in your mouth.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.545
- (grunting)
- Yeah!

15:24.628 --> 15:26.505
I gotta keep mine empty
so I can talk.

15:26.588 --> 15:27.673
Ah!

15:27.756 --> 15:29.884
Keep comin'. Keep 'em coming.

15:29.967 --> 15:32.260
Ah! Ooh!

15:33.846 --> 15:34.847
Whoo!

15:34.930 --> 15:38.684
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Fishlegs! (giggles)

15:38.767 --> 15:42.229
Maps, old books, charts!

15:42.312 --> 15:45.858
Oh ho ho ho! There's no greater treasure
than knowledge.

15:46.650 --> 15:48.402
I'm gonna be rich!

15:48.485 --> 15:51.363
I'm gonna be rich!
Rich, rich, rich, rich, rich!

15:51.446 --> 15:55.076
Hmm, well, hello, Mr. Ornate Box.

15:55.158 --> 15:57.828
What treasures do you hold?

15:57.912 --> 15:59.580
Ha ha ha ha! Rich!

15:59.663 --> 16:01.289
Ho! Rich!

16:02.791 --> 16:04.626
Hair! Ew!

16:04.710 --> 16:06.628
Who keeps hair in a box?

16:06.712 --> 16:08.756
There's got to be more.

16:08.839 --> 16:10.758
More hair? Ech!

16:10.841 --> 16:12.801
Man, what a rip-off.

16:16.638 --> 16:18.599
Or is it?

16:18.682 --> 16:21.393
(Nordic accent)
I'm Stoick the Vast!

16:21.476 --> 16:24.354
Hiccup, you're such
a disappointment!

16:24.438 --> 16:26.941
Why can't you be more
like Snotlout?

16:27.024 --> 16:29.693
Eh, I'm Ruffnut...
Or am I Tuffnut?

16:29.777 --> 16:31.695
Who can tell? Ha ha ha!

16:31.779 --> 16:34.907
I'm... Oh, actually,
this is kind of nice.

16:36.867 --> 16:38.786
Come on, bud.
Don't you want to see

16:38.869 --> 16:41.371
- what's down below?
- (growls)

16:41.455 --> 16:43.582
All right, fine.

16:43.665 --> 16:46.627
Guess I'm going alone.
Ah! Whoa!

16:48.503 --> 16:51.298
Whoa! Okay.

16:51.381 --> 16:53.341
Nobody goes to this much trouble

16:53.425 --> 16:55.260
unless there's something on this boat

16:55.343 --> 16:58.263
- that they don't want found.
- (snorts)

16:58.346 --> 16:59.974
(lock rattling)

17:07.689 --> 17:09.066
Watch your step, bud.

17:12.444 --> 17:14.029
Ooh, Toothless.

17:14.113 --> 17:16.406
One of the benefits
of a metal leg, I suppose.

17:26.875 --> 17:30.504
Okay, let's just take this nice and...

17:34.382 --> 17:35.968
Toothless.

17:40.931 --> 17:42.516
Dragon bones.

17:42.599 --> 17:44.518
(whimpers)

17:44.601 --> 17:46.603
I'm sorry you had to see this, bud.

17:46.687 --> 17:50.232
Whoever commanded this ship
was certainly no friend of dragons.

17:50.315 --> 17:53.068
Let's get out of here.

17:53.152 --> 17:55.863
(metal creaking, banging)

17:58.240 --> 18:00.742
All right, come on, Toothless!
Let's go!

18:06.999 --> 18:08.333
Commander's quarters.

18:08.416 --> 18:09.626
Stay close, bud.

18:12.379 --> 18:14.131
Okay, so here's the plan...

18:16.008 --> 18:17.968
- I like yours better.
- (low snarl)

18:28.103 --> 18:29.646
What is this thing?

18:31.481 --> 18:34.693
Whatever it is, if it's on this ship,

18:34.776 --> 18:36.570
it's no good for dragons.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.780
Which means we're not
leaving it here for Dagur.

18:40.574 --> 18:42.076
Ech.

18:42.159 --> 18:43.618
Hmm.

18:47.998 --> 18:50.084
Huh. Well, that wasn't too-

18:50.167 --> 18:52.253
Giant axe! Toothless, run!

18:53.045 --> 18:55.214
Watch it, Toothless!

18:55.297 --> 18:56.798
Whoa!

19:00.468 --> 19:02.888
Toothless, hold.

19:04.765 --> 19:07.142
Hiccup! Did you miss me?

19:07.226 --> 19:08.894
'Cause I sure missed you.

19:08.977 --> 19:11.772
Every day for three years,

19:11.855 --> 19:13.732
I thought about you.

19:13.815 --> 19:16.651
- Astrid!
- And you too,

19:16.735 --> 19:17.903
Mr. Night Fury.

19:17.986 --> 19:19.404
Sorry, Hiccup.

19:19.487 --> 19:21.489
He got the drop on us
while we were searching...

19:21.573 --> 19:23.200
Uh, quiet! Can't you see

19:23.284 --> 19:25.535
my brother and I
are having a moment?

19:25.619 --> 19:26.912
I'm not your brother

19:26.995 --> 19:28.914
and we are definitely
not having a moment.

19:28.997 --> 19:30.124
Oh, well, I was.

19:30.207 --> 19:32.375
Look at you, all growed up!

19:32.459 --> 19:34.920
And quite the ladies' man, I'd wager.

19:35.003 --> 19:37.047
- Hmm? Hmm?
- Dagur, what do you want?

19:37.131 --> 19:39.049
Duh, he wants the jewels.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.343
He's not getting my family's jewels.

19:41.426 --> 19:44.179
No way! And I'll protect them
at all cost!

19:44.263 --> 19:46.598
Also, what is with that hair?

19:46.681 --> 19:49.601
Ha! It's royal hair,
I'll have you know.

19:49.684 --> 19:52.354
Haven't gotten rid
of the Greek chorus, I see.

19:52.437 --> 19:54.356
Anyway, yes,
I'll take the jewels. His too.

19:54.439 --> 19:56.733
(grunts)
Watch it, pal!

19:56.817 --> 19:57.818
- (laughs)
- (spits)

19:57.901 --> 19:58.944
Oh! (gagging)

19:59.027 --> 20:00.654
Oops, thought that was the guy.

20:00.737 --> 20:02.197
Never can tell with those two.

20:02.281 --> 20:04.116
- (guard spits)
- And I'll also take

20:04.199 --> 20:06.534
whatever it is you're hiding
behind your back.

20:06.618 --> 20:09.537
Come on, hand it over
like a good boy.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.414
Brothers share, you know.

20:11.498 --> 20:13.416
You know you're not going
to get very far

20:13.500 --> 20:14.876
with that thing, right?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.254
Oh, boy, here we go.

20:17.338 --> 20:19.589
Must we always do the same dance,

20:19.673 --> 20:21.175
Hiccup, you and I?

20:21.258 --> 20:23.135
Not that you're not
a fabulous dancer.

20:23.218 --> 20:24.636
(growls)

20:24.719 --> 20:27.055
Easy, bud, not yet.

20:27.139 --> 20:28.890
That's right, Mr. Night Fury.

20:28.974 --> 20:31.059
Today is not the day,

20:31.143 --> 20:33.478
but it's coming! And soon.

20:33.561 --> 20:36.940
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've got people to see,

20:37.024 --> 20:38.984
an army to build, revenge to plot.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.528
Ooh, so much to do
and so little time.

20:41.611 --> 20:43.488
Isn't this exciting, Hiccup?

20:43.571 --> 20:46.616
You... You must have been so bored
over the last three years.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.285
Yeah, he's got a point about that.

20:48.369 --> 20:49.703
Not enough explosions.

20:49.786 --> 20:53.040
Alas, my time here
has come to an end.

20:53.123 --> 20:55.709
Farewell for now, brother.

20:55.792 --> 20:59.754
Until we meet again
on the field of battle.

21:02.465 --> 21:04.467
(grunts)

21:04.551 --> 21:06.970
(grunting, calling out)

21:12.059 --> 21:14.061
Forget about us!
Go after him.

21:14.144 --> 21:16.271
What are you waiting for?

21:17.147 --> 21:18.565
Are you guys sure you'll be okay?

21:18.648 --> 21:20.067
We're fine! Go!

21:20.150 --> 21:21.609
(growls)

21:24.112 --> 21:27.032
Here they come, sir,
just like you said.

21:27.115 --> 21:29.910
Still predictable,
aren't you, brother?

21:29.993 --> 21:31.870
(men grunting)

21:33.914 --> 21:35.665
Fire!

21:35.749 --> 21:37.500
(grunts)
You missed, brother!

21:37.584 --> 21:39.961
Hiccup, you should know by now,

21:40.045 --> 21:41.171
I never miss.

21:41.255 --> 21:42.464
Oh, no!

21:43.840 --> 21:45.675
(all grunting, shouting)

21:47.761 --> 21:51.432
Hiccup! Get us out of here!

21:51.473 --> 21:54.268
(all shouting)

21:54.351 --> 21:56.728
(Dagur) What's it going to be, Hiccup?

21:56.811 --> 21:58.980
Catch me, save your friends?

21:59.064 --> 22:00.774
Ooh, tough one!

22:00.857 --> 22:02.984
Glad I'm not in your shoe.

22:03.068 --> 22:04.986
(Dagur cackling)
