00:00.001 --> 00:01.793
<i>Previously on "Bitten".</i>

00:01.818 --> 00:03.429
- Who is out there?
- The Wolf.

00:03.469 --> 00:04.969
The one who betrayed you.

00:05.004 --> 00:06.984
- Where is he?
- He's with her.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.375
The she-wolf.

00:08.410 --> 00:09.809
Elena, I am your father.

00:09.837 --> 00:11.411
I'm tired of being attacked.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.612
This is the course I've chosen.

00:12.648 --> 00:13.813
We're going to stick to it.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.682
Now this Pack will be strong.

00:15.717 --> 00:17.583
This is how we will restore order.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.785
I hate this.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.586
I have been tracking

00:20.621 --> 00:23.790
a very dangerous Russian Mutt for years.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.658
I believe he is in North America.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.626
Sasha Antonov.

00:27.662 --> 00:29.295
I've never heard that name.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.863
The name Antonov
comes with a heavy price.

00:30.899 --> 00:32.765
It affects my children as well,

00:32.801 --> 00:34.533
so we've been living in hiding

00:34.568 --> 00:37.303
with Katia, Alexei, all of their lives.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.672
Today, the name of
Escobado comes to an end.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.440
Let Roman take the prize.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.676
Buy his friendship with my head.

01:35.808 --> 01:37.540
Mr. Danvers.

01:44.557 --> 01:46.449
I haven't seen you in a long while.

01:46.484 --> 01:49.819
I've been, uh, very busy
with my work, Sheriff.

01:49.854 --> 01:51.754
Oh... I'm surprised you haven't heard,

01:51.790 --> 01:52.955
I'm not the sheriff anymore.

01:52.990 --> 01:55.858
It's... just Karen now.

01:55.893 --> 01:58.460
Well, Just Karen, why don't
you just call me Just Jeremy?

01:58.495 --> 02:00.062
I hope it's happy news.

02:00.097 --> 02:02.597
It's good. Yeah, it was my decision.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.867
I came to Bear Valley
looking for a quieter life,

02:04.902 --> 02:07.036
and after last year, I realized

02:07.071 --> 02:08.937
I was not going to get it being a cop.

02:08.973 --> 02:11.506
I can understand the
appeal of a quieter life.

02:12.943 --> 02:14.343
You look fantastic.

02:14.378 --> 02:16.411
Very relaxed.

02:16.447 --> 02:17.912
Sure don't miss the uniform.

02:17.948 --> 02:19.481
No, this is much better.

02:20.784 --> 02:22.751
You artists know how to embellish.

02:22.786 --> 02:24.919
Not necessary in this case.

02:28.992 --> 02:30.892
This living really suits you.

02:38.434 --> 02:40.434
So, you doing some
work up at Stonehaven?

02:40.470 --> 02:42.036
Never seems to end.

02:42.072 --> 02:43.637
You know, I volunteer
at the youth centre.

02:43.673 --> 02:44.873
There's always kids looking for work.

02:44.908 --> 02:47.408
I'm sure they'd help you out.

02:47.443 --> 02:49.009
I think I can handle this on my own.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.944
But thank you. I will keep that in mind.

02:52.849 --> 02:54.882
It's good to see you in town.

02:56.118 --> 02:57.885
You too, Karen.

02:59.689 --> 03:01.555
I'll try not to be a stranger.

03:10.832 --> 03:12.699
You know, we could've just
burned them like the others.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.467
I don't want to do anything
that's going to draw attention

03:14.503 --> 03:16.736
towards Stonehaven. Especially
not with Roman in town.

03:16.772 --> 03:18.372
Who's he looking for?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.740
He just had a name: Sasha Antonov.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.944
It would be... be hard for a
Russian Mutt to move around

03:24.979 --> 03:26.479
without someone hearing about it.

03:26.515 --> 03:27.881
We should put Elena on it.

03:30.118 --> 03:31.885
What's going on with her?

03:33.455 --> 03:34.687
A lot's happened.

03:34.723 --> 03:37.123
That's why she's being so distant?

03:37.158 --> 03:39.926
Well, things are changing, you
know, the Pack's growing.

03:39.961 --> 03:41.961
She'll adjust. She always does.

03:41.996 --> 03:43.629
She seemed particularly concerned

03:43.664 --> 03:44.964
about Roman the other day.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.465
Well, I don't think she likes him.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.801
Seems a little bit more than that.

03:48.836 --> 03:50.502
She not telling me something?

03:51.739 --> 03:54.039
Huh. She definitely doesn't trust him.

03:54.074 --> 03:55.441
I don't blame her.

03:55.476 --> 03:57.676
I don't trust him either,

03:57.711 --> 03:59.511
but he is the Russian Alpha

03:59.547 --> 04:03.181
and we're not going to start
anything with him right now.

04:03.216 --> 04:05.551
Yeah. She's tense.

04:07.521 --> 04:09.087
We'll bury that today.

04:10.723 --> 04:13.825
I'll talk to her when the time is right.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.994
We're here for her.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.862
We always will be.

05:46.802 --> 05:50.418
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:10.412 --> 06:11.778
Where are we?

06:11.813 --> 06:13.713
Home.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.382
Escrow can close by
the end of the month.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.916
I just need to sign the papers

06:16.951 --> 06:18.517
and give them a cheque.

06:22.167 --> 06:24.133
It's... it's amazing.

06:24.169 --> 06:27.436
Look, we can fix it up in no
time just the way you like.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.106
Best part is, it's surrounded
by a nature preserve:

06:30.141 --> 06:32.608
1000 acres of pristine forest.

06:38.249 --> 06:39.648
Does Jeremy know?

06:41.319 --> 06:44.086
He knows I've been
looking at this place.

06:44.121 --> 06:46.855
I've never kept anything
from him until this morning.

06:46.890 --> 06:49.725
Jeremy knows Roman's here for Sasha.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.460
- What did you tell him?
- I lied for you, Elena.

06:53.864 --> 06:55.363
Telling him the truth is up to you.

06:55.398 --> 06:56.865
You can't keep them a secret.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.734
It isn't fair to Jeremy
and it isn't fair to me.

06:58.769 --> 07:00.368
I know, but... You know

07:00.403 --> 07:02.370
that Jeremy's been different lately.

07:02.405 --> 07:04.773
Just... I don't know how
he's going to react anymore.

07:04.808 --> 07:07.275
This whole other family
that I knew nothing about?

07:09.212 --> 07:10.478
I don't know what to think.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.313
It shouldn't change anything.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.814
- Doesn't change you.
- No, but...

07:16.453 --> 07:19.387
Maybe it... it helps me understand.

07:20.923 --> 07:23.758
When you first saw me,

07:23.793 --> 07:26.493
what did you feel?

07:26.528 --> 07:28.796
I was pulled towards you.

07:28.831 --> 07:30.497
Like no one else.

07:30.532 --> 07:31.899
I felt it too.

07:33.236 --> 07:34.434
Inside.

07:35.772 --> 07:37.238
Maybe we found each other

07:37.273 --> 07:39.673
because my father is a werewolf.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.809
We found each other.

07:42.844 --> 07:44.578
That's all that matters.

07:46.181 --> 07:49.549
You still have to tell Jeremy.

07:49.585 --> 07:50.784
I know.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.421
I know.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.589
And another jet landed
at a private airstrip

07:56.624 --> 07:58.158
just outside of Attica.

07:58.193 --> 08:00.293
It's got Russian tail numbers.

08:00.328 --> 08:02.195
Roman's bringing in men.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.529
I need to know how many.

08:03.564 --> 08:04.931
Why wouldn't he run this by us?

08:07.069 --> 08:08.802
Sasha Antonov. What
do we know about him?

08:08.837 --> 08:10.603
Nothing came up in any search database.

08:10.638 --> 08:13.639
I have no idea how long
he's been in North America.

08:13.675 --> 08:16.842
Cracking Russian records
is next to impossible.

08:16.877 --> 08:19.779
We have to find out what's
going on in Mother Russia.

08:19.814 --> 08:21.580
You know who to phone.

08:31.692 --> 08:33.390
Are they here?

08:33.427 --> 08:35.327
I have brought six men with me.

08:35.361 --> 08:37.761
Not enough. Send for more.

08:37.798 --> 08:39.530
That is difficult.

08:39.566 --> 08:41.366
The districts are grumbling
about money again.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.235
They will need... convincing.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.903
I don't care how you get them here.

08:45.939 --> 08:48.506
Get me what I want.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.342
Danvers will become suspicious

08:50.377 --> 08:51.909
if we bring too many men over.

08:51.945 --> 08:53.712
Then don't be an idiot about it.

08:53.747 --> 08:54.979
Be discreet.

08:55.014 --> 08:57.215
Yes. Of course.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.950
But this is his territory.

08:58.985 --> 09:01.386
We cannot do as we please.

09:01.421 --> 09:02.920
He knows where to hunt for Sasha Antonov

09:02.956 --> 09:04.355
better than we do.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.757
If he is even hunting.

09:06.792 --> 09:10.895
That witch saw Antonov
with Elena Michaels.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.763
They could be trying to hide him.

09:12.798 --> 09:13.965
Why would they do that?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.499
To spit in my face!

09:15.534 --> 09:16.734
After 30 years of running,

09:16.769 --> 09:18.935
Sasha comes here. Why? Why now?

09:18.971 --> 09:20.337
What could he have told him

09:20.373 --> 09:21.772
to make Danvers take such a risk?

09:21.807 --> 09:23.273
These Americans,

09:23.308 --> 09:25.242
you can't trust them, Konstantin.

09:25.277 --> 09:27.411
They're always playing some game.

09:27.446 --> 09:29.446
We're smarter than them.

09:29.482 --> 09:30.714
I want answers.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.716
We need to keep a close eye on them.

09:32.752 --> 09:35.451
Especially Elena.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.719
It will be done.

09:36.755 --> 09:38.355
Good.

09:41.894 --> 09:43.626
- Jeremy.
- Karl.

09:43.661 --> 09:44.895
Always a pleasure to partake

09:44.930 --> 09:47.397
of your hospitality. This isn't exactly

09:47.432 --> 09:49.866
a cigars and scotch type of visit, Karl.

09:49.902 --> 09:51.550
We want to hear about
your time in Russia.

09:51.604 --> 09:52.535
Ah, yes.

09:52.570 --> 09:54.437
Two years ago, I spent about a month

09:54.472 --> 09:55.872
trying to get the niece of an oligarch

09:55.907 --> 09:59.308
to part with her hard-earned allowance.

09:59.343 --> 10:01.102
She proved unyielding in all areas.

10:01.188 --> 10:03.613
How about Roman's Pack?
Any contact with them?

10:03.648 --> 10:04.881
As a matter of fact,

10:04.916 --> 10:07.784
I did see something
interesting in Smolensk.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.889
Roman rules his Pack
primarily through fear.

10:13.925 --> 10:15.590
But Russia is a big territory,

10:15.626 --> 10:17.993
so he's installed district leaders,

10:18.029 --> 10:19.528
men loyal to him,

10:19.563 --> 10:21.430
and he regularly tours the federation.

10:21.465 --> 10:22.898
Any slight, real or perceived,

10:22.934 --> 10:24.499
and it is the district leaders

10:24.535 --> 10:26.802
that are held responsible.

10:26.837 --> 10:28.603
Roman didn't keep that
territory together

10:28.639 --> 10:30.806
for over 30 years by threats alone.

10:30.841 --> 10:34.843
And there speaks an Alpha.

10:34.878 --> 10:36.445
Before I left,

10:36.480 --> 10:38.680
I met his second in command.

10:38.715 --> 10:40.381
- Konstantin.
- Yes.

10:40.417 --> 10:41.582
Now, not much is known about him

10:41.617 --> 10:43.017
other than his loyalty to Roman,

10:43.053 --> 10:45.753
but he was holding court
with these leaders,

10:45.788 --> 10:46.955
handing over briefcases

10:46.990 --> 10:49.824
that were filled with cash.

10:49.859 --> 10:51.725
Konstantin is the carrot.

10:51.761 --> 10:53.627
Roman is the stick.

10:53.663 --> 10:55.430
And so balance is achieved.

10:55.465 --> 10:57.398
But it is precarious.

11:01.604 --> 11:03.737
The Russian Pack isn't run on loyalty...

11:05.374 --> 11:07.875
it's run on money.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.543
And I've heard grumblings.

11:09.579 --> 11:12.613
Those briefcases are not as
full as they used to be.

11:12.648 --> 11:15.048
There's the weakness.

11:15.084 --> 11:17.417
Konstantin handles the money,

11:17.453 --> 11:20.787
and I... can handle Konstantin.

11:28.097 --> 11:29.796
I don't get it.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.832
What's that supposed to be?

11:32.868 --> 11:34.601
She looks like a butterfly.

11:34.636 --> 11:36.836
Well, why not take a
picture of a butterfly?

11:36.872 --> 11:38.037
It's artistic.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.672
Yeah, okay, cool.

11:39.708 --> 11:40.874
We need to get out of here.

11:40.909 --> 11:41.641
We wait for Elena.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.577
We just met her. Aren't you curious?

11:44.613 --> 11:46.513
Like... don't you want to
get to know your sister?

11:46.548 --> 11:48.481
Roman's out there!

11:48.516 --> 11:50.116
Who knows how long before he finds us.

11:50.151 --> 11:52.551
Jeez, stop being so jumpy.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.887
He ordered our mother torn to pieces.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.023
Yeah, I know that.

11:57.058 --> 12:00.393
And I can't un-see it. Ever.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.828
But you know, we're grown-ups now.

12:02.863 --> 12:04.763
I'm almost a wolf, I can fight back.

12:04.798 --> 12:06.565
Well, almost a wolf is not a wolf.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.500
Shh, shh! Quiet, you two.

12:28.188 --> 12:29.587
It's okay.

12:32.859 --> 12:35.126
I brought you food.

12:37.630 --> 12:38.829
Here.

12:42.168 --> 12:45.636
It's not much, but it'll make
you feel somewhat normal.

12:45.672 --> 12:46.938
Thank you.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.673
You're welcome.

12:52.011 --> 12:54.078
- Wait...
- I'm starving.

12:54.113 --> 12:55.845
Roman, is he still here?

12:55.881 --> 12:57.581
Yes. And he's looking for you.

12:57.616 --> 12:59.015
How could he possibly know we came?

12:59.051 --> 13:00.984
- Did your fiancé tip him off?
- Never.

13:01.019 --> 13:03.187
Look, I trust Clay with my life.

13:03.222 --> 13:05.089
Besides, Roman had to
travel from Russia.

13:05.124 --> 13:07.023
He would've been on the
move way before we met.

13:07.059 --> 13:09.626
We were very careful.

13:09.661 --> 13:11.027
Not careful enough.

13:11.063 --> 13:13.129
And no one else knows about us?

13:13.164 --> 13:15.799
No.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.902
But I have to tell Jeremy.

13:18.937 --> 13:21.137
Then we have to disappear.

13:21.172 --> 13:23.139
Oh, great. Let's... let's
pack up the truck.

13:23.174 --> 13:25.675
- Three, four days, we're in California.
- It's not that easy.

13:25.711 --> 13:29.612
If Roman knew we were on the
move, he's tracking us somehow.

13:29.647 --> 13:31.013
We have to get rid of our phones.

13:31.048 --> 13:34.016
We need new set of fake
identities, everything.

13:34.051 --> 13:36.685
Let me help you.

13:36.721 --> 13:38.121
You're safe here for now.

13:38.156 --> 13:39.955
Roman can't manoeuvre
without Jeremy knowing,

13:39.991 --> 13:41.157
and Nick is better than anyone

13:41.192 --> 13:42.925
at disappearing a wolf.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.127
He can get you into a new town,

13:45.162 --> 13:47.062
away from Roman.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.746
_

13:49.934 --> 13:53.736
What makes you think Jeremy
will want to help us?

13:53.771 --> 13:55.771
You're our sister.

13:57.307 --> 13:58.907
He's got to help us, right?

14:01.145 --> 14:02.544
Right?

14:06.950 --> 14:08.283
I'll handle it.

14:21.765 --> 14:23.765
I've been waiting for you.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.999
Join me.

14:26.602 --> 14:28.736
Want some tea?

14:28.772 --> 14:29.971
Sure.

14:37.980 --> 14:40.147
I know that you've been troubled

14:40.183 --> 14:44.285
that I have brought Mutts into the Pack.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.086
The way I've done it...

14:46.121 --> 14:47.888
you think it's too harsh?

14:49.825 --> 14:52.092
It's not my place to say.

14:52.127 --> 14:53.960
Yes, it is.

14:53.996 --> 14:56.129
It's exactly your place.

14:56.165 --> 14:59.132
I need your perspective
as much as anybody's.

14:59.168 --> 15:01.267
It's very important to me.

15:02.304 --> 15:04.571
I'm worried.

15:04.606 --> 15:07.006
You always ran the Pack as a family.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.775
<i>Our</i> family.

15:09.811 --> 15:11.911
Now it's...

15:11.946 --> 15:13.213
it's like an army.

15:13.248 --> 15:15.081
It's an army to defend our family.

15:15.116 --> 15:16.982
It is needed after
everything that's happened.

15:17.018 --> 15:19.619
Bucky turned against us, Jeremy.

15:19.654 --> 15:21.053
How many more are going to do that?

15:21.089 --> 15:22.822
And what about Roman, huh?

15:25.827 --> 15:27.026
You know, you've been on guard

15:27.061 --> 15:28.360
ever since Roman got here.

15:30.765 --> 15:32.698
Is there something you're
not telling me, Elena?

15:36.037 --> 15:40.239
A couple of days ago,
a man contacted me.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.609
A werewolf.

15:43.644 --> 15:44.976
He's on the run.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.379
Sasha Antonov.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.383
He's a very dangerous man, Elena.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.385
Roman's been hunting him for years.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.386
He has his family with him,

15:55.421 --> 15:58.356
a teenaged boy and a girl.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.391
He has a human girl with him?

16:00.426 --> 16:02.861
- And does she know?
- Yes, but...

16:02.896 --> 16:04.262
Jeremy, she's known her whole life.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.730
That doesn't matter.

16:05.766 --> 16:07.799
How can you be so reckless?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.802
Why didn't you tell me?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.243
Does Clay know?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.946
- Elena, does Clay know?
- Yes.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.050
But I wanted to be the one to tell you.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.688
You didn't tell me.

16:31.723 --> 16:33.056
What are you trying to do to us here?

16:33.092 --> 16:35.159
I was trying to find a
way to bring it to you

16:35.194 --> 16:37.460
with a solution. That's not your place.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.834
We're going to find them...

16:44.869 --> 16:46.969
and we're going to turn them
back over to the Russians.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.705
You can't.

16:48.740 --> 16:49.939
Why not?

16:51.743 --> 16:53.843
Sasha is my father.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.280
My real father.

17:03.054 --> 17:05.887
You need to tell me everything.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.123
Right now.

17:30.455 --> 17:32.021
Sasha Antonov?

17:34.192 --> 17:36.125
Jeremy Danvers.

17:36.161 --> 17:37.960
I think you've heard of me.

17:37.996 --> 17:41.430
Yes. Elena said you might be coming.

17:41.465 --> 17:43.166
We need to talk.

17:49.941 --> 17:52.474
There's a place in Minnesota, right?
That your father owned?

17:52.510 --> 17:54.710
A farm, yeah.

17:54.745 --> 17:56.312
Could they stay there?

17:58.282 --> 17:59.448
If they're desperate.

17:59.483 --> 18:00.916
It is Minnesota.

18:00.951 --> 18:02.284
They'd need new identities too.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.753
All right, sure. Easy.

18:04.789 --> 18:07.823
Couple birth certificates
and driver's licences,

18:07.858 --> 18:09.425
couple new passports, and
hey, while we're at it,

18:09.460 --> 18:10.992
- let's get them some jobs...
- Yeah, I know, it's...

18:11.028 --> 18:12.794
it's a lot.

18:12.830 --> 18:13.995
I know that.

18:14.031 --> 18:15.230
It is a lot.

18:17.434 --> 18:19.835
And it can be done, it just takes time.

18:19.870 --> 18:21.536
They don't have time.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.041
Are you sure Jeremy will go for this?

18:26.076 --> 18:28.108
He's talking to my father.

18:32.482 --> 18:33.948
"My father".

18:38.988 --> 18:41.088
We have to help them.

18:41.123 --> 18:43.023
We have to.

18:45.394 --> 18:47.294
Please.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.029
You've seen the way Jeremy's been acting

18:49.065 --> 18:50.831
these past eight months, right?

18:53.102 --> 18:55.269
I'm just saying he may not see things

18:55.304 --> 18:57.004
the same way you do.

19:01.343 --> 19:02.542
But...

19:04.880 --> 19:07.814
Let me see what I can do, okay?

19:09.351 --> 19:10.917
Thank you.

19:10.952 --> 19:12.786
You know, Dad says when
you change into a wolf

19:12.821 --> 19:14.287
for the first time,

19:14.322 --> 19:16.857
it's brutal pain, then release,

19:16.892 --> 19:19.792
- like having an orgasm.
- Ugh!

19:19.827 --> 19:21.294
Seriously, why would you tell me that?

19:21.329 --> 19:23.129
- That's what he said.
- Well, there are some details

19:23.164 --> 19:24.998
you should keep to yourself.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.200
So you were
on the run for years?

19:27.235 --> 19:29.168
Yeah, a long time.

19:29.204 --> 19:31.504
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

19:31.539 --> 19:35.240
Roman described you
as a very dangerous Mutt

19:35.276 --> 19:38.243
who should be hunted down
and killed on sight.

19:38.279 --> 19:41.079
We have a complicated history.

19:41.115 --> 19:43.416
That's none of my concern.

19:43.451 --> 19:46.051
Seems you've already made your decision.

19:48.623 --> 19:50.455
You know, before this
place was closed down,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.958
one of the workers got his hand

19:52.993 --> 19:55.127
in front of the wrong hose.

19:55.162 --> 19:57.595
The silica took all the
flesh off in seconds.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.531
It's a dangerous world.

20:01.435 --> 20:02.634
Hmm.

20:05.239 --> 20:08.072
I'm not going to hide you, Sasha.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.273
I won't take that risk,

20:09.309 --> 20:11.409
there's too much at stake.

20:11.445 --> 20:14.178
But I will not tell
Roman that you're here.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.914
I owe that to Elena.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.582
And if you leave now,

20:17.617 --> 20:21.052
I will turn a blind
eye to your daughter.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.921
You're going to have to
go into hiding again.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.621
You've done it before.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.858
You're going to do it without our help.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.327
This isn't Pack politics.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.196
It's all Roman's personal vendetta.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.864
So if Roman died,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.166
the Russians wouldn't come after you?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.867
No.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.570
This is only between him and me.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.539
Well... if something tragic

20:42.575 --> 20:44.307
happened to Roman while he was here,

20:44.343 --> 20:45.943
that would be his own fault

20:45.978 --> 20:48.946
for not letting me
handle this on my own.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.920
Good luck, Sasha.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.558
As you said,

21:02.594 --> 21:05.395
it's a dangerous world.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.910
Pack.

21:13.935 --> 21:15.735
- Anything you need to take with you.
- What?

21:15.807 --> 21:17.173
Dad says we're leaving tonight.

21:17.341 --> 21:19.675
What about Elena? She
was going to help us.

21:19.711 --> 21:23.078
Change of plans. What else is new?

21:36.027 --> 21:38.060
Dad, why are we leaving?

21:38.095 --> 21:39.628
What's going on?

21:39.663 --> 21:41.630
You remember how I showed
you to throw knives?

21:41.665 --> 21:43.598
Yeah, sure, you made
me do it for months.

21:43.634 --> 21:45.667
Okay, okay.

21:45.702 --> 21:49.004
It's the same idea with other objects.

21:49.039 --> 21:51.105
You find the balance point.

21:51.141 --> 21:53.307
You throw overhand; you
use the strongest muscles

21:53.343 --> 21:54.543
- in the shoulder.
- Yeah, I get it.

21:54.578 --> 21:56.144
I'm not stupid, Dad.

21:56.179 --> 21:58.413
No, no, you're not stupid.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.381
But you're young.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.150
These things that I'm teaching you,

22:02.185 --> 22:04.152
you will need them one day.

22:04.187 --> 22:06.487
I may not always be there.

22:06.523 --> 22:08.622
What do you mean?

22:08.658 --> 22:10.425
What do you mean, you're not
always going to be there?

22:10.460 --> 22:12.427
You're not leaving us...

22:15.331 --> 22:17.631
You sweet boy.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.133
You are too kind for this world.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.538
I wanted to make you tough,

22:24.574 --> 22:27.174
but I just couldn't. I
couldn't bring myself

22:27.209 --> 22:30.010
to take that kindness out of you.

22:30.046 --> 22:32.746
I needed it in my life.

22:32.782 --> 22:36.116
For that, I'm sorry.

22:36.151 --> 22:38.350
It's okay, you know, I...

22:38.386 --> 22:39.685
I need you too.

22:45.426 --> 22:47.426
So, go, okay? Pack.

22:47.462 --> 22:49.528
I have to prepare.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.097
Prepare for what?

22:52.733 --> 22:56.434
Dad... Dad, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

22:56.470 --> 22:58.470
- don't.
- Listen to your sister,

22:58.505 --> 23:01.006
she always knows what to do.

23:01.041 --> 23:04.309
It's a.... dangerous world.

23:24.431 --> 23:25.730
Car's gassed up. Wherever
they want to go,

23:25.765 --> 23:27.465
- we can take them.
- Thanks.

23:27.501 --> 23:29.066
You think it'll be tonight?

23:29.102 --> 23:31.102
Soon as Jeremy gives us the
okay, we can head out.

23:31.137 --> 23:32.703
Every minute that they stay here

23:32.728 --> 23:33.732
is another chance for
Roman to find them.

23:33.781 --> 23:34.264
Elena?

23:34.807 --> 23:36.807
You need to come see this.<i> Now.</i>

23:43.516 --> 23:44.748
What are you doing here?

23:44.783 --> 23:46.150
I told her we should come here.

23:46.185 --> 23:47.351
Uh... Our Dad is...

23:47.386 --> 23:48.685
I don't know, he was...

23:48.720 --> 23:50.320
We think our father's
trying to kill Roman.

23:50.356 --> 23:52.156
Please, you have to help us.

24:00.511 --> 24:02.544
You know, this isn't necessarily

24:02.579 --> 24:04.046
what I had anticipated

24:04.081 --> 24:05.614
when we agreed to meet.

24:05.649 --> 24:08.117
So much of
business is posturing,

24:08.152 --> 24:10.452
the dance of the peacock.

24:10.488 --> 24:13.389
And here there's no
desks to hide behind,

24:13.424 --> 24:14.756
no expensive suits.

24:14.791 --> 24:17.191
Just the naked truth.

24:17.227 --> 24:18.560
Well, plus towels.

24:19.563 --> 24:21.295
Well, your choice.

24:25.736 --> 24:28.202
All right.

24:32.308 --> 24:34.175
The naked truth, then.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.048
Konstantin, my Pack has offered

24:40.083 --> 24:42.050
to deliver Sasha and his family

24:42.085 --> 24:43.351
as soon as we find them,

24:43.386 --> 24:45.453
yet you are still here in North America.

24:45.488 --> 24:47.422
- Why?
- You say you will deliver them swiftly.

24:47.457 --> 24:49.256
Why should we not wait until you do?

24:49.291 --> 24:51.025
And if the tables were turned,

24:51.060 --> 24:53.027
I'm not sure Roman would enjoy us

24:53.062 --> 24:55.462
setting up shop in St. Petersburg.

24:55.497 --> 24:57.264
If this was St. Petersburg,

24:57.299 --> 24:59.399
we would be side by side, yes,

24:59.435 --> 25:02.135
but then tracking your enemy together.

25:02.171 --> 25:05.138
Are you suggesting that
we're not cooperating?

25:05.174 --> 25:06.706
That is simply not the case.

25:06.741 --> 25:10.210
To think so, Roman must
be a very suspicious man.

25:10.245 --> 25:12.512
In our country, he needs to be.

25:12.548 --> 25:14.247
You're in trouble back home.

25:14.283 --> 25:16.550
Not in the least. You,
on the other hand,

25:16.585 --> 25:20.187
after what has happened
over the last while...

25:20.222 --> 25:21.588
Your numbers are down.

25:23.658 --> 25:26.726
We've rebuilt. No worries.

25:26.761 --> 25:28.795
Our worry is the Antonovs.

25:28.830 --> 25:31.197
You made an offer to deliver them,

25:31.232 --> 25:35.568
yet you are doing nothing
to try and find them.

25:35.604 --> 25:38.737
And how exactly would you
know what we're up to?

25:42.810 --> 25:44.776
It is simple.

25:44.812 --> 25:46.178
Bring them to us

25:46.214 --> 25:48.581
and we get on a plane to Russia.

25:48.616 --> 25:51.217
I promise.

25:51.252 --> 25:54.285
We will sit still until then.

26:09.169 --> 26:12.737
Jeremy. They've been
watching us the entire time.

26:31.457 --> 26:32.657
Hey!

26:32.692 --> 26:34.725
Take it easy, you two.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.896
What's the problem?

26:40.299 --> 26:41.699
Move, woman.

26:43.536 --> 26:44.801
Earl, get your car out of here.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.470
What did I tell you
about double parking?

26:46.505 --> 26:48.272
I'll handle this.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.379
See?

26:55.414 --> 26:56.580
No problem.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.815
- No English.
- I got that.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.817
Do you want me to call someone for you?

27:00.852 --> 27:03.319
No, no, I am guest here.

27:03.354 --> 27:05.955
- Whose guest?
- Up, up there.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.524
Big house.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.393
- Stonehaven?
- <i>Da.</i>

27:10.428 --> 27:12.862
- I go.
- Okay then.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.550
I can't believe how hungry I am.

27:35.586 --> 27:36.785
Get used to it.

27:38.422 --> 27:39.621
You got any ketchup?

27:40.758 --> 27:42.290
That's chicken salad.

27:42.326 --> 27:43.625
I like it on everything.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.293
We don't have ketchup.

27:45.329 --> 27:48.430
Make it quick. I don't want to
spend my time watching you eat.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.307
I can take care of myself, you know.

27:59.343 --> 28:01.543
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

28:01.578 --> 28:02.777
My father taught me.

28:02.812 --> 28:04.011
Hmm.

28:05.449 --> 28:07.414
Look, prep all you want,

28:07.450 --> 28:08.816
train all you want,

28:08.852 --> 28:10.517
but until you've gone through the Change

28:10.553 --> 28:12.553
and come out the other side,

28:12.588 --> 28:14.488
you don't know anything.

28:14.523 --> 28:16.590
The new strength you'll get,

28:16.626 --> 28:18.325
the heightened senses,

28:18.361 --> 28:21.495
all those things need to be mastered.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.930
You probably wouldn't last
one day out on your own.

28:40.983 --> 28:43.683
Probably wouldn't last one minute.

28:43.718 --> 28:45.451
You get to clean this up.

28:57.899 --> 28:59.565
You can't attack Roman.

28:59.601 --> 29:01.267
I knew Katia would warn you.

29:01.303 --> 29:02.669
That is good. Apart from me,

29:02.704 --> 29:04.637
you are the only one they are safe with.

29:04.673 --> 29:05.938
Yeah, they <i> were</i> safe with you

29:05.973 --> 29:07.807
until you decided to go
on a suicide mission.

29:07.842 --> 29:09.742
- Are you kidding me?
- Jeremy made it clear to me

29:09.778 --> 29:11.911
he was not going to protect us.

29:11.946 --> 29:14.746
But I know you will look after them.

29:14.782 --> 29:16.916
What?

29:16.951 --> 29:18.750
Jeremy said that to you?

29:18.786 --> 29:21.720
I cannot ask any of you
to fight my fight.

29:21.755 --> 29:24.323
This will all be over soon,

29:24.358 --> 29:25.958
one way or another.

29:27.761 --> 29:29.961
You're going to come back
to Stonehaven with me.

29:29.996 --> 29:31.496
You're going to pick up your kids

29:31.532 --> 29:32.997
and I'm going to help you disappear,

29:33.033 --> 29:35.967
- for good this time.
- Is that really what you want?

29:36.002 --> 29:37.602
To save your lives, yes!

29:37.638 --> 29:38.837
Why isn't that what you want?

29:38.872 --> 29:41.473
I can't have what I want.

29:41.508 --> 29:42.708
What I want is my children

29:42.743 --> 29:45.743
free from running and hiding.

29:45.778 --> 29:48.679
To spend time with you, my daughter.

29:48.715 --> 29:50.448
I want to hear your stories,

29:50.483 --> 29:51.748
to... to make up for...

29:51.783 --> 29:53.851
- It's not that easy!
- No.

29:53.886 --> 29:55.518
No, it isn't.

29:55.554 --> 29:58.388
Not in this life.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.457
So I must do what I
must do to finish it.

30:19.878 --> 30:21.745
- Elena?
<i>- Jeremy, I'm with Sasha.</i>

30:21.780 --> 30:24.646
He's planning on attacking Roman.

30:24.682 --> 30:27.083
What are Katia and Alexei
doing in this house?

30:27.118 --> 30:29.385
They came to me, what
was I supposed to do?

30:29.420 --> 30:31.420
Dammit, Elena, the
Russians are watching us.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.922
If we are caught
protecting the Antonovs,

30:32.957 --> 30:34.757
it's going to draw a line in the sand

30:34.792 --> 30:36.558
that's going to drag
everyone into this conflict,

30:36.594 --> 30:38.094
<i>possibly a war.</i>

30:38.129 --> 30:40.596
So it's true.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.531
You're not going to protect them.

30:44.735 --> 30:46.304
You're putting me in a
very difficult position.

30:46.414 --> 30:47.135
<i>Look, I know,</i>

30:47.170 --> 30:49.605
but Alexei and Katia are innocent.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.808
I don't care about the
rules! They don't deserve this!

30:52.843 --> 30:54.777
<i>There has to be something
that you can do.</i>

30:54.812 --> 30:56.612
I made a promise to Roman
to turn them over.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.113
I can't go back on my word.

31:02.552 --> 31:03.885
Look, Jeremy...

31:06.056 --> 31:07.455
I wouldn't know what to do

31:07.490 --> 31:09.424
if I were in your place, okay?

31:10.860 --> 31:13.094
You have to do what's
right for all of us.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.730
<i>And after everything
that we've been through,</i>

31:15.765 --> 31:16.964
<i>I hate to ask you,</i>

31:16.999 --> 31:19.567
but please, Jeremy...

31:19.602 --> 31:21.669
you have to help me save him.

31:24.774 --> 31:26.774
You're asking me to risk everything.

31:28.711 --> 31:29.911
He's my father.

31:31.113 --> 31:33.013
<i>They're my family.</i>

31:40.722 --> 31:43.991
My hands are tied, Elena.

31:44.026 --> 31:45.525
I'm sorry.

31:49.698 --> 31:51.565
This is his fight alone.

32:16.624 --> 32:18.992
I have to go.

32:19.027 --> 32:21.193
Sure. You go off, attack Roman,

32:21.228 --> 32:23.195
and get yourself killed.

32:23.230 --> 32:24.897
And then what?

32:24.932 --> 32:28.501
Have you even thought
about Alexei and Katia?

32:28.536 --> 32:30.569
Huh? You expect me to take care of them?

32:30.605 --> 32:32.204
They are your family.

32:32.239 --> 32:34.540
If Roman is dead, the Russian Pack,

32:34.575 --> 32:36.774
they will leave my children alone.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.877
What makes you so sure?

32:38.912 --> 32:40.845
This is Roman's blood feud, not theirs.

32:40.881 --> 32:43.081
They will move on, it
will all be forgotten.

32:43.117 --> 32:44.983
You avoided him for 30 years,

32:45.019 --> 32:46.184
- you can do it again.
- No.

32:46.220 --> 32:49.187
No. It's different now.

32:49.223 --> 32:52.524
Why? Huh?

32:52.559 --> 32:54.659
- Why is it different?
- Because of you!

32:55.962 --> 32:57.629
I was... God! Oh, my God,

32:57.664 --> 33:02.500
I was stupid... stupid fool
to come looking for you!

33:04.070 --> 33:05.537
If I do not kill him,

33:05.572 --> 33:06.905
if Roman lives and he find out

33:06.940 --> 33:08.139
that you have my blood in your veins,

33:08.174 --> 33:09.606
you have Antonov blood,

33:09.642 --> 33:11.075
he will stop at nothing to kill you too.

33:11.110 --> 33:12.576
That is how a blood feud works.

33:12.611 --> 33:15.112
He wants to destroy every trace of me.

33:18.217 --> 33:19.783
No, he won't.

33:19.818 --> 33:21.152
Clay, the Pack,

33:21.187 --> 33:23.554
they will tear him apart.

33:23.589 --> 33:25.956
Well, it will not get to that.

33:25.991 --> 33:27.290
I won't let it.

33:45.877 --> 33:47.910
Is she inside?

33:47.946 --> 33:50.080
She must be with Antonov.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.048
Look at you, you're sick with fever.

33:52.084 --> 33:53.849
You cannot fight like this.

33:53.885 --> 33:55.818
Useless. I will call someone else.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.019
It's nothing.

33:57.055 --> 33:59.188
I change, it goes away.

33:59.223 --> 34:03.025
- What about the girl?
- We take her alive if we can.

34:03.061 --> 34:04.594
But if she gets in the way,

34:04.629 --> 34:05.828
kill her.

34:08.605 --> 34:10.572
Roman's not going to leave our territory

34:10.607 --> 34:12.306
till all of the Antonovs
are in his possession.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.542
No...

34:15.277 --> 34:17.612
not willingly.

34:17.648 --> 34:20.248
I didn't build up our numbers
to start a war, Nick.

34:22.022 --> 34:23.588
I did it to avoid war.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.724
To keep all of you safe.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.661
I know you're there, Clay.

34:31.697 --> 34:33.831
And I assume you have
an opinion on this.

34:37.437 --> 34:40.771
Roman's been
hiding things from us.

34:46.193 --> 34:48.193
He's not the only one, is he?

34:52.670 --> 34:54.370
This is Russian Pack business.

34:54.405 --> 34:57.773
Roman, another Alpha,

34:57.808 --> 35:00.776
asked me to help him track the Antonovs

35:00.811 --> 35:03.379
and then turn them over, and
I'm breaking that promise.

35:03.414 --> 35:05.281
Roman's been watching our every move.

35:05.316 --> 35:08.183
Clearly he doesn't trust us.

35:08.218 --> 35:09.385
I don't trust him,

35:09.420 --> 35:11.086
but if I was in Russia

35:11.121 --> 35:13.756
hunting a Mutt who'd wronged my Pack,

35:13.791 --> 35:15.190
I would expect the same support from him

35:15.225 --> 35:16.825
that he expects from me.

35:16.860 --> 35:18.660
You actually think Roman
would help you hunt a Mutt?

35:18.695 --> 35:19.861
Yes!

35:19.897 --> 35:21.897
He would.

35:21.932 --> 35:25.433
'Cause he holds on to
our traditions firmly.

35:25.468 --> 35:28.804
Which means that if I take the
Antonovs under my protection,

35:28.839 --> 35:32.139
I am firing the first shot
in a war with the Russians.

35:32.175 --> 35:34.008
Look, I can make them disappear.

35:34.043 --> 35:35.343
I can get them fake documents.

35:35.378 --> 35:36.744
And what... how many of Roman's men

35:36.780 --> 35:38.045
will be running around our territory?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.980
What other options do we have?

35:43.119 --> 35:45.119
Jeremy...

35:45.154 --> 35:48.122
you can't hand them over.

35:48.157 --> 35:50.124
Katia and Alexei aren't a threat.

35:50.159 --> 35:52.026
How do you know that?

35:52.061 --> 35:53.460
We don't even know them.

35:53.495 --> 35:55.095
They're her family.

35:59.735 --> 36:01.068
<i>We're</i> her family.

36:02.205 --> 36:03.770
I'm not going to enter a Pack war

36:03.806 --> 36:05.305
over a handful of strangers

36:05.341 --> 36:07.741
that I didn't know existed two days go.

36:07.776 --> 36:09.476
Call Roman.

36:09.511 --> 36:10.910
I want to meet him.

36:16.785 --> 36:18.284
Roman is outside of Russia,

36:18.320 --> 36:19.753
away from his fortress.

36:19.788 --> 36:20.987
It may be a handful of men.

36:21.022 --> 36:22.188
That's nothing; he's vulnerable.

36:22.224 --> 36:23.406
He's not going to expect it.

36:23.461 --> 36:25.959
Jeremy is right. It's
the only way to end it.

36:25.994 --> 36:28.261
Why would Jeremy tell you to do this?

36:31.299 --> 36:32.531
Someone's here.

36:35.036 --> 36:37.403
One to the north, one to the south.

36:37.438 --> 36:39.905
- It's a pincer move.
- They're closing in.

38:08.326 --> 38:09.891
Stop right there.

38:09.927 --> 38:12.161
Unless you want me to cut her throat.

38:12.196 --> 38:14.163
Let her go. Please!

38:14.198 --> 38:15.965
Why do you care?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.400
I don't want any more
suffering on my account.

38:18.436 --> 38:20.902
That is good.

38:20.938 --> 38:22.571
Now,

38:22.606 --> 38:24.439
what are you going to do here?

38:24.475 --> 38:26.174
You're going to try and find some...

38:33.984 --> 38:35.851
- Are you going to kill him?
- As much as I'd like to,

38:35.886 --> 38:37.519
I can't kill him.

38:37.554 --> 38:39.520
This is Roman's second in command.

38:41.424 --> 38:44.459
Ah, he is much more valuable than that.

38:54.656 --> 38:56.301
Gather your things. We need to leave.

38:56.326 --> 38:58.093
Did you find our Dad? Is he okay?

38:58.128 --> 38:59.394
Everything is fine.

38:59.429 --> 39:01.496
Let's go, we do not have a lot of time.

39:01.531 --> 39:03.297
Where's Elena?

39:03.332 --> 39:04.665
All of your questions are
going to be answered shortly,

39:04.701 --> 39:06.333
but if you want this to turn out well,

39:06.369 --> 39:09.370
you do what I say. Do you understand?

39:09.406 --> 39:10.571
Good.

39:10.607 --> 39:13.708
This has gone on far too long.

39:13.743 --> 39:15.710
Clay,

39:15.745 --> 39:17.177
bring them in your car.

39:17.213 --> 39:18.412
Follow me.

39:45.106 --> 39:47.407
Please, I just want to
find out what's going on.

39:47.443 --> 39:48.608
- Where are we, Clay?
- Relax.

39:48.644 --> 39:50.343
This isn't good, I know it.

39:50.378 --> 39:52.011
You're important to Elena.

39:52.047 --> 39:53.512
I won't let anything happen to you.

39:53.548 --> 39:56.015
And what if your Alpha tells
you different? What then?

40:01.589 --> 40:03.689
I thought so.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.325
Stay close to them, I don't
want them running away.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.327
- Where's Elena?
- Clay. Go.

40:26.347 --> 40:28.046
They brought us right to Roman.

40:28.082 --> 40:29.781
We should've never trusted them.

40:29.816 --> 40:31.183
Oh, this can't be happening.

40:31.218 --> 40:32.517
Elena wouldn't let this happen.

40:32.552 --> 40:33.370
She's our sister, right?

40:33.461 --> 40:35.420
No, don't you understand?
It doesn't matter.

40:35.455 --> 40:37.589
Even if she's with us, she
doesn't have any say.

40:37.624 --> 40:40.336
The Alphas stick together. We're dead.

40:42.563 --> 40:44.330
Do you have them?

40:45.641 --> 40:46.840
Clay, show him.

40:51.713 --> 40:53.880
Clay, please, I thought we were friends.

40:59.219 --> 41:01.386
That is Alexei, Sasha's son.

41:01.422 --> 41:03.688
His daughter is here too.

41:03.723 --> 41:05.324
This is good.

41:05.359 --> 41:07.492
I knew I could rely on you, Jeremy.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.434
Is that why you were following us?

41:16.470 --> 41:19.036
Contingencies, options, plans.

41:19.072 --> 41:21.072
That's what we do, we are Alphas.

41:21.107 --> 41:22.373
We take control of events

41:22.408 --> 41:24.375
before they take control of us, no?

41:24.410 --> 41:25.710
I don't remember you asking

41:25.745 --> 41:27.545
whether you could have
more men on my territory.

41:27.581 --> 41:30.647
Jeremy, you see treachery
where there is none.

41:30.683 --> 41:32.183
I'm in a foreign land,

41:32.218 --> 41:34.518
one of my dangerous Mutts on the loose.

41:34.553 --> 41:36.220
I only want to make sure

41:36.255 --> 41:38.422
that this does not become
a problem for you.

41:40.659 --> 41:43.060
Your thoughtfulness
is duly noted, Roman.

41:44.263 --> 41:46.630
I see his children,

41:46.665 --> 41:48.765
but where is Sasha?

41:48.801 --> 41:50.200
Nick.

42:02.114 --> 42:03.313
Ah.

42:05.484 --> 42:07.283
It's okay.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.319
You see...

42:09.354 --> 42:14.057
the bond between our Packs is strong.

42:14.092 --> 42:16.426
I will not forget this, Jeremy.

42:16.461 --> 42:18.728
Put them in my car. I
will leave tonight.

42:20.798 --> 42:22.632
No.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.734
No? I don't understand.

42:24.769 --> 42:27.369
There was a time when I
would've helped you, Roman.

42:27.405 --> 42:29.304
But that time has passed.

42:31.409 --> 42:33.776
Who do you think you are, Danvers,

42:33.811 --> 42:35.511
to talk to <i> me</i> like that?

42:35.547 --> 42:36.711
Why wouldn't I just take them?

42:36.747 --> 42:38.680
Because I have your son.

42:42.153 --> 42:44.319
He attacked Elena...

42:44.355 --> 42:45.620
put a knife to her throat,

42:45.656 --> 42:48.457
and I will not let that go, Roman.

42:51.162 --> 42:53.194
Now you and I will settle this.

42:53.229 --> 42:55.296
And then you're going to go home.

42:55.331 --> 42:56.665
What are they to you?

42:56.700 --> 43:00.234
Why are you doing this, Danvers?

43:00.270 --> 43:03.471
I am taking control of events, Roman.
