00:53.178 --> 00:54.804
NARRATOR: The war
between sorcerers

00:54.888 --> 00:57.390
was fought in the shadows of history

00:57.516 --> 01:02.854
and the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful Merlin.

01:04.605 --> 01:08.025
He taught his secrets
to three trusted apprentices,

01:08.193 --> 01:12.488
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.324
He should have trusted only two.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.543
Veronica and Balthazar
witnessed the savagery

01:25.627 --> 01:27.628
of a sorcerer beyond evil,

01:32.843 --> 01:37.096
Morgana le Fay,
Merlin's most deadly enemy.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.282
We are but servants.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.911
- Merlin.
- Horvath!

02:01.622 --> 02:02.955
You betray me?

02:03.040 --> 02:04.040
(GASPS)

02:06.210 --> 02:07.710
I am no one's servant.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.548
Well done. Now get the spell.

02:12.633 --> 02:17.553
NARRATOR: And so it was. Morgana
gained sorcery's most dangerous spell

02:17.805 --> 02:20.097
known as "The Rising,"

02:20.265 --> 02:23.309
giving Morgana the power
to raise an army of the dead

02:23.393 --> 02:24.685
and enslave mankind.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.454
Veronica sacrificed herself
for Balthazar

02:43.539 --> 02:46.791
by drawing Morgana's soul
into her own body.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.294
But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.

02:52.548 --> 02:56.050
To save Veronica's life
and to capture Morgana,

02:56.218 --> 02:59.512
Balthazar trapped them both
in the Grimhold,

03:00.013 --> 03:01.681
an inescapable prison.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.853
Over time,
Balthazar fought many sorcerers

03:06.937 --> 03:08.521
who tried to free Morgana,

03:08.689 --> 03:11.649
trapping them in layer upon layer
of the doll.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.903
Eventually, he captured
Horvath as well.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.742
As Merlin lay dying,
he gave Balthazar his dragon ring,

03:21.910 --> 03:24.287
saying it would guide him to the child

03:24.371 --> 03:27.415
who would one day grow
to be Merlin's successor,

03:27.791 --> 03:29.292
the Prime Merlinean.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.919
The Prime Merlinean is the only one

03:32.796 --> 03:35.214
who can kill Morgana.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.509
NARRATOR:
Balthazar would search for centuries.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.112
And never, it is said,
will Balthazar waver from his quest,

03:58.822 --> 04:01.073
for mankind will never be safe

04:01.241 --> 04:06.370
until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinean.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.544

04:16.005 --> 04:18.798

How did you even get up here?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.510
DAVE'S MOM: David? Field trip today.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.804
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.890
She means me, not you.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.487
(KIDS LAUGHING)

04:52.793 --> 04:54.794
You're not supposed to be
doing that, Dave.

04:55.921 --> 04:56.921
Now!

04:59.716 --> 05:00.716
BECKY: David.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.636
That's cool.

05:17.651 --> 05:22.029
...which means that before Ellis Island
and the Statue of Liberty were built...

05:22.656 --> 05:24.115
DAVE: (WHISPERING)
Pass it to Becky.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.117
OSCAR: Pass it on.
BOY: Pass it on.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.202
GIRL 1: Pass it to Becky.
GIRL 2: Here.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.888
MS. ALGAR: Let's go.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.058
Get on the ferry. Get your bags.
Stay close. Here we go.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.112
Hey, stop!

06:20.172 --> 06:21.797
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.549
No!

06:24.384 --> 06:25.426
No, lady, don't!

No way.

of the Han dynasty

07:49.177 --> 07:54.390

in this urn for 10 years to the day.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.894
They say you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.273
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.234
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.153
A note?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.779
It blew into your store.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.781
(STAMMERING) It was just a...

08:10.949 --> 08:12.575
Coincidence.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.243
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.543
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.421
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!

08:28.216 --> 08:29.592
It's on your backpack.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.138
Come over here.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.571
This is very special

08:50.697 --> 08:53.616
and if it likes you, you can keep it.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.204
I better not. My teacher said
I couldn't be gone for long.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.455
She knows I'm here.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.040
You're a bad liar, Dave.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.043
That's good.

No way.

09:41.081 --> 09:45.292

09:46.836 --> 09:49.880
Magically, here you are.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.175
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.594
It means

09:55.679 --> 09:59.515
you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day.

10:00.308 --> 10:05.187
And your first lesson begins right now
with your very own Encantus.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.400

Not where. The year.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.325
You are wasting my time.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.626
What happened
to "don't touch anything"?

11:50.794 --> 11:52.795
That's not very sporting of you,
Balthazar.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.879
Be quiet.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.092
It's not you. He's been like this
for 1,000 years. I'll explain later.

No! Don't go in there!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!

Dave, are you familiar
with the gray wolf?

16:02.086 --> 16:05.130
Oh, no, please, Bennet. Not this again
with the gray wolf. I can't...

16:05.214 --> 16:07.633
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

16:08.176 --> 16:12.471
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.264
He must participate.

You're going to get
booted out of the pack!

So have I! A figurative urn of ridicule.

Do you know that in certain parts
of the tri-state area,

with the Grimhold.

So unless you want him to turn you
into a pig who just loves physics,

29:21.760 --> 29:24.595
Sorcerers can manipulate matter

29:24.680 --> 29:26.722
to use the entire power of their brains.

29:26.849 --> 29:30.351

Yes and yes.

I can hold it.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.114
I am Balthazar Blake,

40:09.699 --> 40:12.618
sorcerer of the 777th degree,

40:13.953 --> 40:16.413
and you are my apprentice.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.750
Sweet.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.253
Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.

40:23.505 --> 40:27.049
It projects the electrical energy
of your nervous system

40:27.175 --> 40:28.801
into the physical world.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.137
Without his ring,
a sorcerer is powerless.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.140
The only other thing a sorcerer needs

40:36.017 --> 40:38.352
is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.605
Your rubber soles block the current.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.565
Plus it helps to look classy.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.734
These are old man shoes.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.030
Excuse me?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.199
I love them.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.119
A lot.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.932
I haven't seen that cane since I saw
a picture of it when I was a boy.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.810
You've been locked up a long time.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.145
And now I'm out.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.397
And I need soldiers.

41:23.648 --> 41:24.690
I got one kid.

41:26.568 --> 41:27.985
He ain't old school.

41:28.403 --> 41:29.820
One will do.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.157
Your ingenuity and your heart

41:33.825 --> 41:36.285
will give you an advantage
over Morganians.

41:36.369 --> 41:39.246
They rely only
on the power of their magic.

41:40.206 --> 41:44.418
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice,

41:45.003 --> 41:46.211
the plasma bolt.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.471
Nothing. There's nothing.

41:57.765 --> 42:00.434
I got it! I got one! I got one!

42:02.812 --> 42:04.104
That's underwhelming.

42:05.857 --> 42:06.857
God.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.443
Again.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.028
Ow! Ow! Ow!

42:18.161 --> 42:19.536
(READING)... and invite my soul...

42:19.621 --> 42:20.746
And again.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.000
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!

42:33.218 --> 42:36.053
DRAKE: So, out of a bath full of jewels,
I'm going to emerge, right?

42:36.137 --> 42:37.721
And everyone's going to think I'm me.

42:38.139 --> 42:41.433
I reach into the big top hat
and I pull myself out,

42:41.643 --> 42:43.310
but I'm a woman.

42:43.770 --> 42:48.023
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting
in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.276
If I could get, like,
a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.238
But not out of its mouth,
that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.

42:55.365 --> 42:59.117
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.

42:59.202 --> 43:02.287
Yeah. Yeah, now,
keep it straight up sinister.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.332
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.710
Sorry, are you lost?

43:09.545 --> 43:12.839
So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.803
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...

43:17.887 --> 43:19.471
Will you excuse us, ladies?

43:19.681 --> 43:21.556
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.978
Bob.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.063
Sorry.

43:29.148 --> 43:33.026
So, they tell me
you're some kind of entertainer.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.281
Five sold-out shows at the Garden,
plus back end on the pay-per-view.

43:39.367 --> 43:42.244
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

43:42.328 --> 43:45.831
Look, my master disappeared
when I was 15, vanished!

43:45.915 --> 43:47.582
Left me with nothing but an Encantus

43:47.667 --> 43:50.294
and some prescription-grade
abandonment issues.

43:50.378 --> 43:52.170
So I improvised.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.756
Well, the time for improvisation is over.

43:56.843 --> 44:00.220
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinean.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.596
He wears the ring?

44:01.889 --> 44:02.889
Mmm.

44:05.935 --> 44:08.437
The best way to defend against fire,

44:10.857 --> 44:12.024

44:13.985 --> 44:14.985

44:18.823 --> 44:19.990
(GASPING)

44:20.074 --> 44:21.575
I did it! I did it!

44:22.076 --> 44:24.036
Excellent. Excellent.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.496
- Excellent.
- I just did that.

44:29.208 --> 44:32.711
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.925
Really, really funny.

44:39.052 --> 44:40.719
- This will be hilarious, then.

44:49.228 --> 44:52.272
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten in 10 years.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.608
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

44:54.984 --> 44:57.152
You mind if I ask
what's so special about this bench?

45:01.949 --> 45:03.658
- No, no, no.
- What?

45:03.743 --> 45:05.577
There's no time for that,
and too much at stake.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.412
That girl,

45:08.331 --> 45:10.248
she's the one, man.

45:11.167 --> 45:13.210
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

45:13.294 --> 45:17.172
Aren't you supposed to help me
to achieve my personal goals?

45:18.091 --> 45:20.550
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.344
I'm your master.

45:22.428 --> 45:25.472
And your master says
if Horvath catches you out on the street,

45:25.556 --> 45:26.932
you'll die.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.059
Is she worth that?

45:29.352 --> 45:31.269
Think about it, Dave.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.319
And don't eat my sandwich.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.989
Becky! What a coincidence.

BECKY: Oh, hey, Dave.

45:44.867 --> 45:47.536
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?

45:47.620 --> 45:49.121
Not in a threatening way.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.415
Why was I even concerned?

45:52.583 --> 45:54.501
So I listened to your show last night.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.711
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.

45:56.796 --> 45:58.547
I've never actually heard
of any of those bands,

45:58.631 --> 46:00.966
which I think is a good indicator
that they're cool.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.426
(BECKY LAUGHING)

I don't get up to much.

Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.144

- Okay, okay.

46:34.333 --> 46:37.169
You just give me
that bracelet back, please.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.171
You better run back to your girlfriend.

46:42.884 --> 46:44.217
You thought she was my girlfriend?

46:44.886 --> 46:47.512
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?

46:47.638 --> 46:49.723
You talk too much. Shut up.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.436
What are you doing?

- Yeah. Here you go.

Your grandmother's bracelet.

47:14.582 --> 47:17.667
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.713
I've been doing a lot
of cardio boxing lately.

47:22.590 --> 47:25.425

- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?

47:39.273 --> 47:42.275
Yes. Thank you.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.694
I just want to tell you that

47:45.071 --> 47:47.030
if you want me to help you
with your midterms,

47:47.281 --> 47:48.323
come by my lab.

- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?

47:53.162 --> 47:54.204
It's a date.

47:55.790 --> 47:59.793
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.046
No. A date like an appointment!

48:11.347 --> 48:14.391
Love is a distraction.

to see a genuine icon like me.

- Tesla coils.

to generate something called plasma.

on the technical aspects of it

something kind of

54:44.323 --> 54:46.074
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing is happening.

54:46.158 --> 54:47.992
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

54:48.077 --> 54:50.036
- That's nerves and it's the pressure.
- I got nothing happening.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.121
- I'm new at this.
- The ring's on. Take the ring off.

54:52.206 --> 54:53.289
- Take off the ring.
- Take it off.

54:53.374 --> 54:57.001
- Yeah, it doesn't help me...
- Enough, you idiot. Watch the door.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.049
You.

55:06.387 --> 55:07.428
No!

55:09.390 --> 55:11.557
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.

55:12.893 --> 55:15.019
- So, Dave.
- Oh, man.

55:17.564 --> 55:22.068
I'm going to kill you. Oh, yes,
right here in this dismal bathroom.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.862
It's not very classy, but there you go.

55:25.614 --> 55:27.240
But before we get
to that unpleasantness,

55:27.324 --> 55:29.283
you're going to tell me
where the Grimhold is.

55:30.953 --> 55:31.995
Where is she?

55:33.580 --> 55:34.622
She?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.876
He hasn't told you, has he?

55:39.712 --> 55:42.338
The truth about who's inside the doll?

55:44.383 --> 55:48.553
Sweetheart, you've put your faith
in the wrong man.

55:50.723 --> 55:54.142
Tell me, have you ever been in love?

55:55.811 --> 55:56.853
- I...
- Yeah.

55:56.937 --> 55:59.272
You're in love right now.
I can see it in your eyes.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.607
No, no, no, no. Don't deny it.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.402
I wonder what would happen

56:06.030 --> 56:07.613
if you lost her.

56:09.324 --> 56:10.700
Shut up.

56:13.954 --> 56:16.664
You'd be no better than the rest of us.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.590
Where is the Grimhold?

56:28.552 --> 56:29.594
I don't know.

56:30.137 --> 56:32.930
Oh, Dave, you really are
the most dreadful liar.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.183
That's what I keep telling him.

56:35.309 --> 56:36.684
Want your guy back?

56:38.979 --> 56:39.979
Oh!

56:44.068 --> 56:47.779
It's been a while since I've seen
the Hungarian Mirror Trap.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.201
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.500
Balthazar, look out!

57:06.715 --> 57:08.966
What are you doing here, Dave?

57:09.802 --> 57:11.552
Horvath was trying to kill me.

57:11.637 --> 57:14.013
His moral compass
doesn't exactly point north.

57:14.098 --> 57:16.182
Yeah, well, what about yours? Huh?

57:16.517 --> 57:19.352
You haven't been completely truthful
with me.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.188
That guy called me
the Prime Merlinean.

57:22.523 --> 57:24.482
Balthazar, what is that?

57:24.691 --> 57:26.734
Now, I'm not doing anything else

57:27.027 --> 57:30.863
until you start being truthful with me
about what's going on.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.700
Who is in that Grimhold?

57:36.578 --> 57:37.829
Morgana.

57:45.170 --> 57:46.462
Wake up that moron

57:46.547 --> 57:49.215
in stall number three for me,
would you?

57:54.638 --> 57:55.847
Oh, for heaven's sake.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.016
BALTHAZAR: Morgana.

57:59.434 --> 58:03.354
She was making preparations
for The Rising,

58:04.022 --> 58:06.649
something that would enable her
to enslave mankind

58:06.733 --> 58:09.235
by resurrecting
dead Morganian sorcerers.

58:10.237 --> 58:12.446
So, after the witch girl,
there's another doll

58:12.531 --> 58:14.907
that contains the greatest evil
the world has ever known?

58:15.242 --> 58:16.284
She's in the last doll.

58:16.702 --> 58:20.413
And what does it have to do with this

58:21.874 --> 58:23.541
Prime Merlinean?

58:23.625 --> 58:25.626
Merlin had three apprentices.

58:26.086 --> 58:27.295
I was one of them.

58:28.755 --> 58:31.090
You were Merlin's apprentice?

58:31.383 --> 58:33.259
He cast a spell to keep us from aging

58:33.635 --> 58:37.180
until we found the sorcerer
who would inherit his power.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.308
And his dragon ring.

58:43.103 --> 58:46.105
Some part of you, no matter how small,

58:47.649 --> 58:49.317
must share the same blood.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.111
As Merlin?

58:52.779 --> 58:54.614
Great men have always been called.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.657
This is your calling.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.243
Merlin said,

58:59.953 --> 59:04.165
"The only one who will ever be able
to destroy Morgana once and for all

59:04.249 --> 59:05.833
"is the Prime Merlinean."

59:07.669 --> 59:10.129
So I'm supposed to save the world.

59:11.798 --> 59:14.967
I... I just don't think I'm up for that.

59:16.303 --> 59:18.137
Do you think
I've been teaching you magic tricks

59:18.222 --> 59:19.805
for some little girl's tea party?

59:21.934 --> 59:26.354
When you stepped inside this circle,
I told you there was no going back.

59:26.438 --> 59:27.480
You took an oath!

59:29.191 --> 59:32.276
I have been searching
1,000 years for you.

59:32.986 --> 59:35.613
Fighting Morganians,
protecting the Grimhold.

59:35.697 --> 59:37.490
You're going to set me free.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.243
You have to become
the Prime Merlinean.

59:41.161 --> 59:42.912
And I'm not asking.

59:51.672 --> 59:54.674
I have a student who's failing my class.
I need his file.

59:55.509 --> 59:59.011
First I'll need to see
your faculty identification card.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:05.059
You don't need
to see my faculty identification card.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.024
I don't need
your faculty identification card.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.903
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:17.321
(LAUGHING)

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:25.705
Here it is.
He has an unauthorized lab space.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.582
(GROANING)

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:32.837
Okay, so, how will I know when I'm it?

01:00:33.422 --> 01:00:35.923
The Prime Merlinean?

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.802
The Prime Merlinean
will become so powerful within

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.972
he no longer needs his ring
to cast magic.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.890
When you can do that,

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.101
you're ready to take on Morgana.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.814
Tank! What is he doing here anyway?

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.985
This should be good.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.822
Schematic for a fusion spell.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.659
The merging of two souls
into one physical body.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:08.748
I've only ever seen one sorcerer
successfully pull off human fusion.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.500
And Tank is here for...

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:12.835
Practice.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.005
Are you telling me
you're trying to possess Tank?

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:21.385
(FARTING)

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.722
Yeah. I'm not so sure
it's the best idea, either.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.432
No.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:30.728
Oh, man.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:37.234
Becky's coming now,
and I'm standing in a puddle of pop.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.611
I need to stop and clean.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:39.904
We're not done training.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:41.072
(EXHALING)

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:46.035
Balthazar, I've been waiting
for 10 years to see this girl again.

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:48.788
Do you have any idea what that's like?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.917
When I come back,
you better be focused.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.714
Ow.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.260
This is really sticky.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.431
I'm doomed.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.601
This.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:16.148
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.659
I command you to stop!

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.791
Oh, no. Man.

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:12.389
(EXCLAIMING)

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.277
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.279
Becky.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.033
- Hi.
- Hi. You're on time.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:35.871
- You forgot?
- No, no, no. I didn't forget.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.915
- Is everything okay?
- What, me?

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.667
How are you doing? (EXCLAIMING)

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.710
I'm good. I'm good.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:45.005
Would you please stop that?
Will you...

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.090
(EXCLAIMS)

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:51.136
It's probably best for you to leave.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.222
What am I saying?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.558
Okay. Okay, I will go.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:58.477
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having issues.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:07.778
My coils!

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:17.162
(EXCLAIMING)

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:22.876
Disperse!

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:40.394
You have abused the sacred art,
and you have abused the Merlin Circle.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.271
Magic isn't a game.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:43.981
No shortcuts!

01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:46.692
Falling in that water
and getting electrocuted,

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.611
that's how a sorcerer loses his power!

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:52.656
What rule is that?
Fourteen? Twenty-seven?

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:53.991
I can't even remember!

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.451
What difference does it make

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.786
if it's obvious
that I can't even control a few mops?

01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:59.788
The stronger the man,
the stronger the sorcerer.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.124
Thank you.
Thank you for another useless motto!

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.459
I have another one for you.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:06.295
You will not control your magic
if you will not control yourself.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.964
You need to stop your worrying
and start believing in yourself.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.466
Is that what you do?

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.218
- What I do isn't the point.
- I think it is.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:17.097
I'm convinced you exist purely
to make my life a living hell.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.436
You don't know anything
about a living hell.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:31.153
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.948
No ring, right?

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:42.247
No magic.
I can't move the chairs. I can't do it.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.293
It's not me, Balthazar.

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:48.337
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:55.469
I'm not it. I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinean.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.680
I'm just a physics nerd

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:01.600
who looks really, really stupid
in these shoes.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:13.922
Dave.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.843
What are you doing here?

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:22.014
I saw you outside the coffee shop,
so I followed you.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.058
You looked a little more distressed
than usual.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.810
That bad, huh?

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.313
Did you really think that
one botched date

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.648
was going to make me
hate you forever?

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:34.859
Yeah.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:40.698
I do have to ask you this one thing.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:44.368
What are you doing up here?

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.580
Yeah.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.042
A friend of mine brought me here once.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.712
And the height doesn't bother you?

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.466
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.176
Trust me. Here, come on.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.428
Come on. You're good.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.846
- You're good.
- I don't know.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:06.892
(BECKY SIGHING)

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.394
Wow.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.523
Yeah. Wow.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:18.487
Do you remember when you drew
King Kong on the bus window?

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.948
And he lined up
with the Empire State Building?

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.575
You remember that?

01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.577
It was cool.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:31.082
You saw the world in your own way.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.585
I was just trying to impress you.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:39.466
Well, it worked.
Not bad for a 10-year-old kid.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.053
Yeah, right. What happened?

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.640
- What? What do you mean?
- The bitter irony of the fact

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:51.435
that 10-year-old me
is far cooler than 20-year-old me.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.274
I think 20-year-old Dave is...
He's all right.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:10:00.529
Like, "all right" all right,
or "all right!" all right?

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.114

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:07.119
I think he is somewhere in the middle.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:10.664
That's a diplomatic answer.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.083
And thank you.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.595
- Hey.
- Hello.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:25.846
I'm sorry.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.682
I think you and I need to have a talk.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:32.227
No apology necessary. Let us move on.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.146
(WITH ENGLISH ACCENT)
You're a diamond, mate.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.662
HORVATH: Surprisingly well done.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.289
Now go find the Grimhold.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:59.421

- This isn't about that.
- Oh, yes, it is, Balthazar.

then I promise I will do my best
to understand.

- Okay.

- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'm here.

Bad time, Dave.

Bennet. Thank God you answered.

I need you to meet me
at my lab right now!

- Becky, I got to let you out.
- What? Let me out?

Okay.

I think I know how to defeat them
without any magic.

How?

The rings on Horvath's cane.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:14.395
He put them there to gain more power,
but they make him a better conductor.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.857
Dave, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.985
All right, Rebecca, here it is.

Many evil sorcerers will be
raised from the dead tonight.

So, basically, Morgana is trying
to destroy the world as we know it.

Oh, just that.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:36.208
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.378
Well, I think I'm already into it.

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:44.008
And besides, if you blow it,
we're all gonna die anyway, right?

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.344

- Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.

Oh! I found this after we hung up.

01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:01.067
It was on the desk.

"Give this to Veronica. Balthazar."

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:14.288
I don't think Balthazar's planning
on coming back.

I don't know
what you're into here, Dave,

No. See what?

could you please tell me?

Don't die and I'll tell you.
