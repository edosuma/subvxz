16:32.592 --> 16:34.275
Okay.

16:34.361 --> 16:38.262
<i> While junior had</i>
<i> some serious thinking to do,</i>

16:38.365 --> 16:40.915
<i> I realized the well</i>
<i> had run dry.</i>

16:41.001 --> 16:41.933
<i> I was getting desperate.</i>

16:42.035 --> 16:43.250
You got to tell me
<i> something.</i>

16:43.353 --> 16:44.902
Anything!

16:45.021 --> 16:45.970
Who pinched who?

16:46.072 --> 16:48.272
Hmm?
Who pooped their pants?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.691
I don't know.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.858
[ sighs ]

16:50.944 --> 16:53.160
what kind of kindergarten
am I paying for?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.947
I need something relatable
to sell cars.

16:56.065 --> 16:58.216
Had to take another hit
off that pipe, huh?

16:58.334 --> 17:00.485
Couldn't get enough
of our sweet, sweet brain ideas,

17:00.587 --> 17:01.502
could you, pookie?

17:01.588 --> 17:02.754
Pathetic.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.023
Okay.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.257
Look, you guys were right.

17:06.376 --> 17:07.625
I got nothing.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.145
Maybe I am relying on you
too much.

17:11.247 --> 17:15.233
But you guys are where I get
my inspiration from.

17:15.351 --> 17:17.035
You know, when it's time
for me to tell stories

17:17.137 --> 17:18.369
and get people
to feel something,

17:18.471 --> 17:22.557
I go to the place
where<i> I</i> feel something -- home.

17:24.194 --> 17:25.710
Well...

17:25.812 --> 17:28.346
I guess I could explain why
I smell like street tacos.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.447
Wait.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.316
Before we tell
our stories,

17:32.435 --> 17:34.218
from now on, we need to be
fairly compensated.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.269
Mm.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.938
A hundred a pitch...

17:37.023 --> 17:38.423
A thousand if the ad
gets made.

17:40.827 --> 17:41.626
Deal.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.561
Okay, so,
it was around 11:15

17:43.663 --> 17:45.530
when we drove past
this taco truck

17:45.632 --> 17:47.414
with a giant chicken
on top.

17:47.517 --> 17:48.883
Now, it wasn't
a normal chicken.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.485
He was wearing
overalls.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.303
Uh, what color overalls?

17:52.422 --> 17:56.074
<i> Turns out, my kids have always</i>
<i> held me up.</i>

17:56.192 --> 17:59.010
<i> I was proud of</i>
<i> who they'd become.</i>

18:00.263 --> 18:01.446
Hey.

18:01.564 --> 18:02.880
Hey.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.232
Got you something.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.283
Aww.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.290
Aww.

18:12.408 --> 18:13.908
It's an extra large

18:13.993 --> 18:15.810
so you can still wear
a bunch of sweaters underneath.

18:15.895 --> 18:16.811
Mm.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.279
You're gonna
want to layer.

18:22.886 --> 18:25.203
Look, when you
got into yale,

18:25.321 --> 18:26.921
all I could think about
was what it meant to me,

18:27.006 --> 18:28.473
because I'm scared
to lose you.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.908
Well, you're not
gonna lose me.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.510
Look, I know
it'll be hard,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.429
but we can make this work
long-distance.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.782
I'll facetime you
three times a day.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.984
We'll use our air miles
to visit each other.

18:40.103 --> 18:42.603
I'll even schedule my classes
so that we can watch

18:42.705 --> 18:44.172
"90 day fiancé"
together.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.641
But it'll be on
at like 11:00 your time.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.127
I'll drink coffee.
I don't care.

18:49.245 --> 18:52.363
We're gonna make
this work, okay?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.948
We have to.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.534
Hell, I'm best friends
with your mama.

18:56.653 --> 18:57.935
I don't know
if we have a choice.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.370
[ both laugh ]

18:59.489 --> 19:02.356
<i> it's not always easy</i>
<i> to do the right thing --</i>

19:02.458 --> 19:06.160
<i>especially when the right thing</i>
<i> costs you the most.</i>

19:06.246 --> 19:09.463
Here's a toast to future
yale grad olivia lockhart.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.665
Whoo!

19:10.750 --> 19:13.134
Oh, olivia, you're gonna love it
at white howard.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.802
You know, we actually
worked out the math,

19:14.888 --> 19:17.839
and we'll be able to see each
other at least once a month.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.708
All I have to do is hop on
a direct flight to hartford.

19:20.810 --> 19:22.727
Then, it is a one-hour
train ride --

19:22.846 --> 19:25.513
plus a short cab ride --
to see my lady.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.382
Wait till she tries to find
good barbecue in new haven.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.067
Well...
Hey, mazel tov!

19:30.186 --> 19:31.769
Mazel tov!
Mazel.

19:31.888 --> 19:33.738
Olivia: You know, I just really
want to thank you all.

19:33.857 --> 19:35.356
You've become, like,
my second family.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.440
Aww.

19:36.559 --> 19:38.109
Olivia, we will always
have your back.

19:38.227 --> 19:40.444
[ chuckles ]
and mine.

19:40.563 --> 19:42.864
I hope this is the right time
to bring this up,

19:42.949 --> 19:46.167
but with rent being
the way that it is,

19:46.252 --> 19:48.202
I will, um...

19:48.288 --> 19:50.688
Probably have to
move back in.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.956
Party's over!

19:52.074 --> 19:54.208
Party is over. Come on.
Give it up. Give it up.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.210
Olivia, you getting into yale
is the worst thing

19:56.296 --> 19:57.461
that's ever happened
to this family.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.429
Thank you.

19:58.548 --> 19:59.630
Thank you, son.
Goodbye.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.603
Alright, I'm headed
to the grocery store,

20:05.688 --> 20:06.988
so let me know if you guys
need anything special.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.940
You know,
we've been thinking about

20:09.025 --> 20:11.359
your long-distance
situation,

20:11.477 --> 20:14.195
and we've got some experience
in that area.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.147
Back in the '70s, I used to work
on this offshore rig

20:17.250 --> 20:19.867
out in the gulf of mexico,
and every week,

20:19.969 --> 20:22.920
I would get an erotic drawing
from your grandmother.

20:23.006 --> 20:25.957
[ laughs ]
I tried to send pictures,

20:26.042 --> 20:27.758
but the boys
at the fotomat

20:27.844 --> 20:29.677
kept stealing 'em,
you know.
Mmm.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.045
Oh, god!

20:31.163 --> 20:34.048
And then there was the time
I was traveling the country

20:34.166 --> 20:37.835
defending my welterweight
foxy-boxing title.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.387
Ding ding!

20:39.505 --> 20:41.472
Earl would send me
tapes of him

20:41.557 --> 20:43.841
reading the barry white
lyrics.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.643
And lots of
"penthouse" letters.

20:45.728 --> 20:46.677
Okay, you know what?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.012
I think I'm just --
I'm gonna go.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.013
Yeah, you know...

20:49.115 --> 20:51.181
That barry white stuff
was real good.

20:51.284 --> 20:54.518
I wouldn't mind another one
of them exotic drawings --

20:54.621 --> 20:58.039
you know, something like
in your foxy-boxing outfit.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.374
Ruby's boobies
just everywhere.

21:00.493 --> 21:06.547
Oh, well...
