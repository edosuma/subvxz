WEBVTT

01:46.410 --> 01:47.578
Pull!

01:49.329 --> 01:50.372
Pull!

01:54.751 --> 01:56.336
Pull right!

02:01.800 --> 02:03.677
This is of your doing, Rollo.

02:19.026 --> 02:20.402
Look, upriver!

02:42.424 --> 02:43.634
I can see.

02:46.303 --> 02:48.180
Raise the standards.

02:48.263 --> 02:50.140
Raise your standards!

02:50.223 --> 02:52.309
Raise your standards!

02:58.065 --> 02:59.858
Sound the horns!

03:04.821 --> 03:07.824
Prepare to move
alongside and board!

03:19.836 --> 03:21.254
Front line!

03:21.838 --> 03:23.298
Advance!

03:38.438 --> 03:40.357
May God be with us.

03:49.366 --> 03:53.620
From the fury of the Northmen,
O Lord, deliver us.

03:54.871 --> 03:58.500
We commit ourselves
into the hands of our Lord.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.336
We know that the Lord,
our God, will smite

04:01.420 --> 04:03.255
and deliver us
from our enemies.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.132
Glory be to God.

04:05.215 --> 04:07.050
Glory be to God.

04:08.385 --> 04:12.723
Holy Mother, I beg you,
don't forget my husband.

04:13.223 --> 04:17.226
I carry his child,
a Christian child.

04:17.978 --> 04:21.440
Holy Mother,
you can forgive all sins.

04:22.399 --> 04:25.861
And so I ask you,
in all humility,

04:26.403 --> 04:30.657
to forgive and
protect my beloved husband,

04:31.742 --> 04:35.203
who, at this hour,
is also trying to protect
this place of worship

04:35.537 --> 04:37.873
and all these
Christian people.

04:57.642 --> 04:59.394
Bowmen, to your stations!

05:13.283 --> 05:14.284
Ready!

05:16.077 --> 05:17.370
First rank!

05:17.454 --> 05:18.538
Loose!

05:26.004 --> 05:28.465
Loose arrows!

05:31.676 --> 05:34.179
Second rank! Loose!

05:37.849 --> 05:40.310
Third rank! Loose!

05:40.393 --> 05:41.478
Loose!

05:42.771 --> 05:43.772
Fourth rank!

05:44.189 --> 05:45.232
Ready!

05:45.315 --> 05:46.483
Loose!

05:47.567 --> 05:50.654
Fourth rank! Loose!

05:55.450 --> 05:56.827
Advance!

06:36.283 --> 06:37.617
Charge!

08:13.463 --> 08:14.798
What are your orders?

08:15.131 --> 08:16.216
My orders?

08:17.133 --> 08:18.635
Shall we break off the attack?

08:19.469 --> 08:20.929
Regather our forces?

08:23.223 --> 08:24.975
"Break off the attack"?

08:25.725 --> 08:28.144
We have already sustained
considerable losses.

08:28.979 --> 08:32.023
Perhaps, in the circumstance,
it would be better if
we took ourselves...

08:49.874 --> 08:51.751
All of my life,

08:53.086 --> 08:57.007
and all of your lives,
have come to this point.

08:59.092 --> 09:01.678
There is nowhere
else to be but here.

09:02.303 --> 09:05.056
Nowhere else to live or die,
but here.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.935
To be here now
is the only thing
that matters.

09:11.229 --> 09:12.230
So gather yourselves,

09:12.981 --> 09:15.191
gather all of your strength

09:16.151 --> 09:19.362
and all of your sweetness
into an iron ball.

09:20.321 --> 09:23.742
For we will attack
again and again.

09:24.159 --> 09:26.786
Until we reach
and overcome their king,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.329
or we die in the attempt!

09:29.080 --> 09:30.165
We attack!

09:30.248 --> 09:32.292
Attack! Attack! Attack!

09:32.584 --> 09:33.626
Blow the horns!

09:34.127 --> 09:37.005
Beat the drums
and have courage,

09:37.088 --> 09:38.923
for there will be
no turning back!

09:39.007 --> 09:42.135
Only victory or death!

09:46.806 --> 09:48.600
What is he going to do?

09:51.269 --> 09:53.188
He'll do what
he always does...

10:00.987 --> 10:02.238
Attack.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.785
Ragnar!

10:08.244 --> 10:10.413
Rollo, we're coming for you!

10:10.955 --> 10:12.081
Good.

10:15.126 --> 10:16.419
Let them try.

10:17.086 --> 10:18.546
We are ready.

10:21.341 --> 10:23.885
Row! Faster!

10:25.178 --> 10:26.471
Faster!

10:42.946 --> 10:45.114
I'll live.

10:46.449 --> 10:48.368
Rollo!

10:48.785 --> 10:53.039
Betrayer of the gods and all
the sacred things in Midgard!

10:53.790 --> 10:55.333
Come here, you snake!

10:55.750 --> 11:00.630
Come my way,
and let my ax slake
its thirst on your blood.

11:01.297 --> 11:02.799
Come to Floki.

11:03.007 --> 11:06.469
Come to Floki, you bastard.
I am waiting.

11:07.679 --> 11:09.931
Ragnar, what else can be done?

11:11.349 --> 11:14.269
There is nothing
else to be done.

11:21.025 --> 11:22.777
Do the gods favor us?

11:24.612 --> 11:26.322
Of course they favor us.

11:27.073 --> 11:29.909
How could they favor Rollo
after he renounced them?

11:31.035 --> 11:34.330
I just need to hear it
from your father's mouth.

11:38.835 --> 11:43.131
Row! Row! Row!

11:43.214 --> 11:45.008
Faster.

11:47.677 --> 11:48.761
Faster!

12:19.500 --> 12:22.670
Even as we sit here,
eating and drinking,

12:23.546 --> 12:26.341
Duke Rollo and our forces
are engaged with the enemy.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.343
I know.

12:28.509 --> 12:29.802
And I have made
every effort to make sure

12:29.886 --> 12:31.054
that, if the Duke should fail,

12:31.137 --> 12:32.889
Paris will still
be well-defended.

12:33.806 --> 12:35.683
Your Highness
should be assured that you
are not completely

12:35.767 --> 12:37.393
dependent upon a Northman.

12:37.602 --> 12:40.855
I rather like being dependent
on a Northman.

12:42.315 --> 12:43.900
They tend to tell the truth.

12:46.402 --> 12:48.154
Your grandfather
warned against them.

12:48.863 --> 12:50.949
He said
they were the greatest threat
against his empire.

12:51.199 --> 12:56.746
My grandfather,
wise as he was,
great as he was,

12:58.081 --> 13:00.291
did not understand everything.

13:02.418 --> 13:03.920
Times change.

13:04.462 --> 13:06.547
But the threat of
the Northmen remains!

13:06.631 --> 13:08.424
Of course it remains,
poor Roland.

13:10.802 --> 13:12.011
And yet,

13:12.178 --> 13:13.596
I trust Duke Rollo.

13:14.430 --> 13:16.265
I trust him completely.

13:17.433 --> 13:18.601
I have his heart,

13:19.519 --> 13:20.853
and he has mine.

13:21.521 --> 13:22.522
He has your heart?

13:23.272 --> 13:24.273
Yes.

13:24.774 --> 13:26.025
He has my heart.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.819
Don't be so stupid!

13:28.111 --> 13:29.862
Ah! There is the truth.

13:30.446 --> 13:32.198
I am stupid, after all.

13:34.492 --> 13:36.369
And not,
as I thought, merely weak.

13:37.078 --> 13:38.621
Merely vacillating.

13:38.997 --> 13:40.373
Indecisive.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.461
It has, indeed,
taken me a long time
to understand

13:45.545 --> 13:47.046
who my real friends truly are.

13:51.175 --> 13:52.635
Now,

13:53.136 --> 13:55.013
we must have something
to finish our meal.

13:55.471 --> 13:56.848
I'm not hungry.

13:57.056 --> 13:58.975
It doesn't matter,
Count Roland.

14:00.643 --> 14:04.063
Where you
and your bitch are going,
you can eat angel's wings.

14:45.980 --> 14:50.234
Put your backs into it!
Row! Row!

15:27.563 --> 15:29.524
Prepare to breach!

15:49.168 --> 15:50.753
Onward!

17:36.108 --> 17:38.527
Look at you!
You look like a bitch.

17:40.238 --> 17:44.325
You're not my brother.
You never have been.

17:47.662 --> 17:49.497
One of us will die today.

17:50.331 --> 17:53.709
And it won't be me, brother!

19:39.148 --> 19:40.358
Brother!

19:48.240 --> 19:51.786
Odin! Where are you?

21:25.754 --> 21:29.008
Bjorn, get her on the boat!

21:46.567 --> 21:48.944
Come!
Cut the ropes.

21:53.782 --> 21:55.117
Get her out of here!

22:04.418 --> 22:06.879
Leave me! Leave me!

22:16.180 --> 22:18.474
Row! Row!

22:22.144 --> 22:23.145
Enough!

22:25.356 --> 22:26.607
Enough!

22:26.690 --> 22:27.858
Let them go!

23:57.281 --> 23:59.408
Rollo! Rollo!

24:39.114 --> 24:40.366
Father!

24:40.908 --> 24:44.787
I present the savior of Paris!

24:45.287 --> 24:47.289
The hero of Frankia!

24:58.133 --> 24:59.301
Stand.

25:18.737 --> 25:20.197
Hail, Caesar!

25:20.489 --> 25:22.866
Hail, Caesar!

25:22.950 --> 25:25.494
Hail, Caesar!

27:24.279 --> 27:25.447
Bjorn!

27:27.407 --> 27:29.076
You'd better come.

27:50.138 --> 27:51.473
Who's this?

27:51.682 --> 27:52.808
His name is Thorhall.

27:54.476 --> 27:55.936
He has come with a story.

27:58.146 --> 27:59.648
I'm listening.

28:01.149 --> 28:03.652
I went on a raiding party
last year to England,

28:03.735 --> 28:05.112
with Earl Gunnar Asgrimsson.

28:05.696 --> 28:09.032
We fought against
the armies of King Ecbert,
and wintered in Wessex.

28:09.533 --> 28:11.535
And made a treaty
with Ecbert's ealdormen.

28:14.121 --> 28:18.208
And they told us
that your father, King Ragnar,

28:18.292 --> 28:21.378
had sired a child there
by Queen Kwenthrith of Mercia,

28:21.461 --> 28:24.256
and that this child
still lives at Ecbert's court.

28:27.551 --> 28:28.594
What's the child's name?

28:29.011 --> 28:30.220
Magnus.

28:31.138 --> 28:33.599
He is a young man now,
12 years old.

28:42.190 --> 28:46.194
And you are certain
that this Magnus
is really my father's child?

28:46.987 --> 28:48.113
How can I be certain?

28:48.572 --> 28:50.449
I was not there
at the conception.

28:55.662 --> 28:57.372
Why would they lie?

29:08.258 --> 29:09.885
There was
something else
you learned

29:09.968 --> 29:11.762
from Ecbert's ealdormen,
was there not?

29:14.222 --> 29:15.349
Well?

29:17.476 --> 29:20.270
It was about your father's
farming settlement in Wessex.

29:20.771 --> 29:22.939
We asked if it still existed
and they laughed,

29:23.273 --> 29:26.568
and said it was destroyed
almost as soon as
your father sailed away.

29:28.028 --> 29:31.907
But that they allowed some
of the settlers to escape,

29:32.074 --> 29:35.285
so they would take the word
to your father, as a warning.

29:38.288 --> 29:39.414
He never mentioned it.

29:40.207 --> 29:41.625
Ask him now.

29:43.919 --> 29:46.338
We don't know where Ragnar is.

29:47.297 --> 29:50.008
He left soon after
his defeat in Paris.

29:51.343 --> 29:53.553
We haven't seen him in years.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.432
Forgive me asking,

29:58.433 --> 30:00.310
but how could such
a man just disappear?

30:08.026 --> 30:11.154
Go and eat and drink
after your long journey,
Thorhall.

30:13.615 --> 30:15.283
We are grateful
for your visit.

30:28.338 --> 30:30.382
I have to tell the boys.
Where are they?

30:30.966 --> 30:33.343
They went up
to the cabin to hunt.

31:42.329 --> 31:43.830
Ivar. Wake up.

31:46.416 --> 31:47.959
Bjorn is here.

32:01.890 --> 32:03.517
You think our
father never knew?

32:04.059 --> 32:05.227
It's possible.

32:07.604 --> 32:10.232
In those early days,
it wasn't easy to
navigate the sea.

32:11.191 --> 32:12.275
He knew.

32:12.692 --> 32:13.735
He had to.

32:13.818 --> 32:15.445
If he did, he should
have told the people.

32:16.071 --> 32:17.405
Everyone lost relatives.

32:18.073 --> 32:20.075
Fathers and uncles,
sons and daughters.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.410
They would have
demanded revenge.

32:22.494 --> 32:24.454
That is why he
didn't tell them.

32:25.413 --> 32:27.332
What do you mean?
It was a waste of time.

32:28.333 --> 32:29.417
They were dead!

32:30.252 --> 32:32.587
Ragnar wanted
to sail to Paris.

32:32.671 --> 32:34.172
He wanted to be famous.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.591
Isn't that more important?

32:37.884 --> 32:38.885
Hmm?

32:41.221 --> 32:42.305
You could say that?

32:42.973 --> 32:44.099
I can say that.

32:44.724 --> 32:45.767
What does that mean?

32:45.850 --> 32:46.851
Here's what it means,

32:47.727 --> 32:48.812
at least to me.

32:49.437 --> 32:51.147
Our father abandoned us.

32:51.439 --> 32:53.108
We were just kids
and he ran off.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.777
Only the gods know
if he's still alive.

32:56.861 --> 33:01.116
And now we hear
he kept this big
secret from everyone.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.786
That he was not
truthful or honest.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.288
This makes me feel sick.

33:07.330 --> 33:09.541
How could our father
not tell the people
what had happened?

33:10.792 --> 33:13.420
Maybe if he'd told them,
they would have killed him.

33:17.799 --> 33:18.967
If it's true...

33:20.427 --> 33:23.054
If it's true that our father
lied to his people,
and abandoned them,

33:23.138 --> 33:25.348
then I hope he
never comes back.

33:25.432 --> 33:27.017
He betrayed our name.

33:27.892 --> 33:29.019
If he ever came back,

33:30.437 --> 33:31.438
I would kill him.

33:33.148 --> 33:34.316
Me too.

33:34.816 --> 33:35.942
Screw you!

33:36.651 --> 33:37.986
All of you.

33:39.738 --> 33:42.115
He never did anything wrong.

33:42.991 --> 33:44.326
He is our father.

33:46.369 --> 33:47.996
And that is the end of it.

33:49.706 --> 33:53.460
You all sound like
a bunch of Christians.

33:55.503 --> 33:57.547
I love our father
as much as you do.

33:57.756 --> 33:59.382
Who said I loved him, Ubbe?

34:00.467 --> 34:02.052
I said I admired him.

34:02.927 --> 34:04.346
He's Viking.

34:06.139 --> 34:07.766
And you are soft.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.851
I am not soft!

34:10.351 --> 34:12.145
None of us is soft.

34:13.188 --> 34:15.440
But we want to understand
what our father did,

34:15.523 --> 34:17.150
and what he was.

34:17.817 --> 34:20.362
As his son, his fame
does not interest me.

34:21.696 --> 34:24.532
What he used his power for,
now that would interest me.

34:27.327 --> 34:31.039
By now, my brothers,
there will be a lot
of anger in Kattegat.

34:31.581 --> 34:33.541
Now they know the truth.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.670
Our father betrayed
a whole generation of people.

34:36.753 --> 34:38.088
So if he ever came back...

34:38.170 --> 34:40.215
I don't think he is
ever going to come back.

34:42.634 --> 34:45.887
I think what happened in Paris
finally broke him.

34:48.181 --> 34:51.059
You can all say
whatever you want,
but he was a human.

34:52.518 --> 34:54.603
People started to
talk as if he was a god.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.481
He was not a god,
he was a man!

34:57.357 --> 34:59.901
A man with many dreams
and many failings.

35:01.861 --> 35:04.572
I've learned that in the years
since he went away.

35:05.490 --> 35:07.575
If I was him,
I wouldn't come back.

35:13.289 --> 35:14.916
Despite all his failings,

35:16.418 --> 35:18.545
he's still the greatest man
in the world to me.

36:01.504 --> 36:03.465
Did you know
Ragnar lied to us all?

36:05.467 --> 36:08.303
The settlement in Wessex
was destroyed as
soon as we left.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.686
I know.

36:18.688 --> 36:20.398
A farmer who
escaped the slaughter

36:20.482 --> 36:22.358
told your father and
I what had happened.

36:23.318 --> 36:25.945
And Ragnar killed him
so no one else would find out.

36:28.907 --> 36:31.326
You're a good friend
to my father.

36:34.162 --> 36:35.371
Hello, Bjorn.

36:36.247 --> 36:37.415
Helga.

36:41.127 --> 36:43.797
I was just coming to see
how the boats
were progressing.

36:45.381 --> 36:47.300
What do you say, Helga?

36:48.468 --> 36:49.511
What shall we tell him?

36:50.220 --> 36:52.430
We think that it won't be long
until you have boats

36:52.514 --> 36:55.183
ready and able to take you
to the Mediterranean Sea!

36:56.351 --> 36:57.685
If it exists.

36:58.353 --> 36:59.979
Of course it exists.

37:00.063 --> 37:01.439
It's just a map, Bjorn.

37:01.731 --> 37:03.858
Marks on a paper.
A child could have drawn it.

37:04.692 --> 37:05.860
How can we know it's real?

37:08.863 --> 37:10.573
I learned from my father.

37:12.742 --> 37:15.078
The only way to tell
if something is real...

37:20.041 --> 37:21.292
...is to sail there.

37:26.881 --> 37:28.508
I hope you come
with me, Floki.

37:29.801 --> 37:31.344
Are you joking?

37:31.803 --> 37:33.596
The lure of an imaginary land.

37:34.055 --> 37:35.765
Traveling somewhere
that doesn't exist.

37:37.976 --> 37:40.353
Of course I'm coming.

37:45.608 --> 37:47.610
And I hope you
come too, Helga.

37:47.694 --> 37:51.781
Well,
if Floki is mad enough to go,
then I guess I will follow.

40:24.267 --> 40:27.395
Let us pass. Move.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.041
Hello, Ivar.

40:52.211 --> 40:53.963
There's no mistaking you.

40:57.592 --> 41:01.137
It appears
my return is not welcome.

41:03.181 --> 41:05.600
You've obviously
all made your
mind up about me.

41:09.479 --> 41:11.189
I cannot blame you for that.

41:14.442 --> 41:15.485
So.

41:16.861 --> 41:18.237
Well, boys,

41:19.572 --> 41:21.699
who is going to do it, then?

41:25.912 --> 41:27.163
Who's going to kill me?

41:31.292 --> 41:32.668
Well, I don't mind.

41:34.670 --> 41:35.963
Go ahead.

41:37.173 --> 41:38.549
Please.

41:41.219 --> 41:42.678
What about you, Hvitserk?

41:43.638 --> 41:45.932
You think you're a man now?
Huh?

41:48.100 --> 41:49.352
I dare you.

41:52.063 --> 41:53.940
Put me out of my misery.

41:55.316 --> 41:56.317
Do it.

41:56.859 --> 41:58.027
Do it.

41:58.402 --> 41:59.737
Do it, do it. Do it!

42:01.656 --> 42:03.407
Look at these people!

42:04.742 --> 42:06.410
They no longer support me!

42:07.203 --> 42:08.204
Look!

42:10.498 --> 42:11.791
Why would they?

42:14.168 --> 42:16.587
I am your leader,
and I just left!

42:18.714 --> 42:20.967
What kind of
leader does that, huh?

42:21.467 --> 42:24.762
What kind of king
abandons his people?

42:34.897 --> 42:38.025
What kind of father
abandons his sons?

42:55.918 --> 42:57.795
So, who wants to be king?

43:04.343 --> 43:06.470
You know how this works!

43:07.346 --> 43:08.806
If you want to be king,

43:10.141 --> 43:11.475
you must kill me.

43:13.978 --> 43:14.979
Take it.

43:17.899 --> 43:18.900
No?

43:20.234 --> 43:22.069
You? No? What about you?

43:22.194 --> 43:23.279
No? No?

43:23.529 --> 43:24.572
Anyone?

43:26.324 --> 43:28.826
Who wants to be king?
