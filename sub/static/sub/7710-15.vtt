WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:03.537
So...
I'm happy to be here.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.573
It's very nice
to see all of you.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.774
You're all looking well.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.776
Today's a Women
in the Workplace thing.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.045
Jan's coming in
from corporate

00:11.079 --> 00:14.815
to talk to all the women
about, um...

00:14.848 --> 00:16.250
I don't really know what.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.086
But Michael's
not allowed in.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.820
She said that
about five times.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.624
Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

00:23.657 --> 00:26.727
we often face a very different
set of obstacles...

00:26.760 --> 00:28.729
in getting there, so...

00:28.762 --> 00:29.563
Hey, what's going on?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.565
Michael, I--
Yeah, you know what?

00:31.599 --> 00:33.067
I thought we agreed--
I thought about it.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.535
I just have few things
I wanna say.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.770
What are you doing?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.072
Just hear me out.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.807
than quality?important

00:39.840 --> 00:42.110
Equality.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.345
Now, studies show
that today's woman,

00:44.378 --> 00:46.414
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her,

00:46.447 --> 00:47.848
is at a crossroads.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.683
Michael--
And--no, just, I--

00:49.717 --> 00:51.585
You have come
a long way, baby.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.686
But I just...

00:52.720 --> 00:54.788
just wanna keep it
within reason.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.090
They did this
up in Albany--

00:56.124 --> 00:58.592
You are not allowed in--
And they ended up
turning the break room

00:58.626 --> 01:00.161
into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.862
Now you're really
not allowed in this session.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.464
Well, I'm their boss,
so I feel like--

01:03.497 --> 01:04.832
I'm your boss.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.572
Anybody want any coffee
or anything?

01:11.605 --> 01:12.773
We're fine, Michael.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.874
We just need you
to leave, please.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.875
Women in the workplace.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.345
Yeah, translation:

01:17.378 --> 01:19.247
I have been banned
from my own conference room

01:19.280 --> 01:21.449
so that Jan can talk in secret
to all the girls.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.751
Oh, sorry.
"Women of the Workplace."

01:23.784 --> 01:25.153
About what?
I don't know.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.156
Clothes, me...

01:28.189 --> 01:28.856
Ick.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.858
Ladies, I am so,

01:30.891 --> 01:31.925
so sorry.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.862
Can we...start again?
We were on such a roll.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.131
I-I really apologize
for that.
Jan.

01:37.165 --> 01:37.831
Yes, Pam?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.233
Michael's still
at the door.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.401
Michael!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.403
One obsticle is how
assertiveness

02:15.436 --> 02:17.838
is perceived differently
in men and women.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.741
Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.711
They're called...
anyone?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.479
That's a terrible idea.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.947
What is?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.782
Them in there
all together.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.251
They stay in there
too long,

02:30.284 --> 02:33.554
they're gonna get
on the same cycle.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.755
Wreak havoc
on our plumbing.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.259
Everyone, guys...

02:38.292 --> 02:39.427
Circle up, please.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.495
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.864
Toby, come on over.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.967
You're a guy...too.
Sort of.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.936
Let's do this.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.604
Well, first of all,

02:50.638 --> 02:52.640
I, uh, just wanna
warm up a little bit.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.674
Let's just clap.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.376
Let's just clap.
Ready?

02:55.409 --> 02:57.345
Yeah!

02:57.378 --> 02:59.580
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

02:59.613 --> 03:00.981
I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.884
Just having a little
guys in the workplace thing.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.987
Why can't boys
play with dolls?

03:07.020 --> 03:10.291
Why does society

03:10.324 --> 03:12.726
force us to use urinals

03:12.760 --> 03:14.562
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.330
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
We have nowhere else, Jan.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.333
This...

03:19.367 --> 03:20.801
We could do it
in the warehouse.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.636
Dwight, excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.405
Okay, fine.
Be actually perfect.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.706
Perfect!
You know what?

03:25.739 --> 03:28.809
There is another side
to this place, gentlemen.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.878
And I know we all love

03:30.911 --> 03:33.514
our cushy jobs and our fun,
exciting office.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.516
But do you realize
that underneath us

03:35.549 --> 03:36.817
there is another world.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.686
The warehouse world.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.989
A world that is teeming
with sweat and dirt

03:42.022 --> 03:43.691
and life.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.659
Life.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.328
The bowels of the office.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.696
These guys are down there.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.465
They are real men
doing real man's work.

03:51.499 --> 03:55.303
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.039
Oh, I think this is gonna
work out great.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.809
Because
managing the warehouse

04:01.842 --> 04:03.744
is a very important
part of my job.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.913
And I haven't been there
in months.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.873
Remember on Lost,
when they met the Others?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.810
I'm so sorry about that.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.079
Um, so where were we?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.848
Pam, are you okay
taking notes then?

04:40.881 --> 04:41.982
Mm-hmm.
Please?

04:42.015 --> 04:44.084
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.853
So let's meet
the warehouse!

04:45.886 --> 04:48.656
Let's get some shots.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
Pan around there.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.661
This is Darrell,
one of our warehouse staff.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.564
Darrell, what is
your biggest fear?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.499
My biggest fear is that
someone will distract us

04:58.532 --> 04:59.967
from getting all
the shipments out on time.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.034
You know what?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.670
Darrell is actually
the foreman here,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.905
and not Roy,
which is cool.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.640
There's Roy,
ridin' the big rig!

05:06.674 --> 05:08.942
Um, so Roy is actually
going to be marrying Pam

05:08.976 --> 05:10.778
sometime this summer.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.913
And, uh, she's
our receptionist.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.782
Sort of a BrAngelina thing.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.016
Why?

05:16.049 --> 05:19.387
BrAnangelina is
the Brad Pitt and Angelina.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.121
I don't understand.
Roy...Roy and Pam.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.690
It's a Ram.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.857
It's a Ram thing.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.994
I bet Roy heard about
you liking Pam.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.128
I bet he'll try

05:28.161 --> 05:30.531
to beat you up.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.965
Thanks for
the heads-up, Kev.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.568
I got your back
if he does.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.373
But try to stay out of it.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.875
Just in case there's
somebody down here

05:41.909 --> 05:43.076
who shouldn't be.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.812
A little Good Will Hunting
situation.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.647
All right, troops.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.983
This is...an important day.
A big day.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.952
Now, you may

05:51.985 --> 05:56.123
look around and see
two groups here.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.858
White-collar, blue-collar.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.460
But I don't
see it that way.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.561
And you know why not?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.964
Because I am collar-blind.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.634
Why don't we
go around the table

06:06.667 --> 06:09.002
and all say something
that we know we're good at.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.706
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.975
Hi, I'm Meredith,
and I'm an al--

06:15.008 --> 06:16.977
Good at supplier relations.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.446
Great.
Phyllis.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.514
Um, I'm good
at computer stuff.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.183
E-mails, um, spreadsheets,
all that.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.418
Really?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.119
I don't know.
I thought that...

06:26.153 --> 06:27.621
No, okay, stop.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.989
You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.057
And I almost always--
Really?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.525
I thought
they were pretty--

06:31.559 --> 06:33.427
I don't know how I fit in
with these women.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.463
Here.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.930
Or with Jan.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.899
Um, I mean,
we get along great.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.033
Fine.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.771
Um...I guess the person
I have the most in common with

06:43.804 --> 06:45.573
is...

06:45.606 --> 06:47.040
Jim.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.542
Halpert.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.810
Hey, uh,

06:49.843 --> 06:50.944
I, uh, you know.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.813
Heard there's a rumor
going around about,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.682
you know, you used
to have a crush on Pam.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.749
Oh, no, no, no.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.950
No, no.
No, it's cool.

06:56.984 --> 06:57.851
'Cause I know
you're a good guy,

06:57.885 --> 06:58.886
and I know that
that crush

06:58.919 --> 07:01.489
ended a long time ago,
so, you know.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.023
We're cool, right?

07:03.056 --> 07:05.859
Yeah.
No, yeah, definitely.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.960
You know,
it's great with me,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.028
'cause that way...

07:08.061 --> 07:09.663
I'm glad she has
a friend at work

07:09.697 --> 07:10.864
she can get through
the day with.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.199
That way she's not all,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah,"

07:12.232 --> 07:13.200
you know,
when she gets home.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.935
Yeah, I like
talking to her too.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.937
So, uh...
we're cool, right?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.972
Yes. Yeah.

07:19.006 --> 07:19.973
Good.
All right.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.709
Cool, man.
Sweet.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.117
Hey, Mike, look.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.686
How about we go
upstairs, too, you know?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.021
Learn how
an office works.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.656
Oh, well--
We can both switch places
for the day.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.090
Okay, yeah,
you know what?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.859
I don't...you're...

07:38.892 --> 07:40.528
My job sucks
compared to this.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.195
I don't think
you'd like it up there.
Good experience.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.997
Guys! You wanna start
unloading the truck?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.936
Okay, let's go.
Step up.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.971
Check this out.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.040
Look at that.
Look at that.

07:53.073 --> 07:53.974
Ba boop!

07:54.007 --> 07:55.208
"Hello, how are--"

07:55.242 --> 07:56.744
Okay.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
That's great.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.750
That is good stuff.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.153
In five years, I'd like
to be five years sober.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.255
That is an excellent goal.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.923
4 1/2.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.725
I'll tell you
one thing.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.661
I am not gonna be
one of those women

08:13.694 --> 08:15.929
schlepping her kids
around in a minivan.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.731
Great. Uh-huh.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.534
I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.035
That would be great.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.136
Well, I'll be honest.
One of the goals

08:23.170 --> 08:24.572
of these women's seminars

08:24.605 --> 08:25.839
is to feel out if there's
any standouts.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.942
Women who could be a valuable
addition to our corporate life.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.682
Michael wants us to bond.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.049
So we need topics
for conversation.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.851
Ponies.

08:37.885 --> 08:38.952
No.

08:38.986 --> 08:39.853
How about rainbows?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.221
No.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.556
Flowers.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.691
That's dangerous,
Michael.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.858
Come on, get down
from there.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.893
You're gonna
hurt yourself.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.927
Mike--
Stand clear.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.761
Mike, get off
of the lift, please!

08:47.795 --> 08:49.062
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Come on, now.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.764
I'm fine.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.567
Would you...look.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.968
Oh, oh, oh!

08:59.206 --> 09:00.974
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.343
We're the ones that
gotta clean that up!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.511
Damn it, Michael!

09:04.544 --> 09:07.781
We have to have
this thing serviced.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.151
So, guys' gripe session.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.252
Here we are.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.887
Now, we definitely live

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
in different worlds,

09:15.956 --> 09:18.091
but we have a lot
in common.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.828
We even like
the same girls,

09:20.861 --> 09:22.062
some of us.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.030
And that's gonna happen.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.197
You know, we're guys.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.966
So...

09:25.999 --> 09:27.801
Hey...do you
want me to go?

09:27.835 --> 09:30.003
No...why would I...

09:30.037 --> 09:30.938
You could...

09:30.971 --> 09:31.972
I'll go.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.206
Stay or...

09:34.975 --> 09:36.744
And a big,
walk-in closet.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.945
Oh, that's part
of my dream too.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.713
Oh, me too.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.849
Great. Okay.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.150
And, Pam,
what about you?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.718
What is your dream?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.888
Well...I always
dreamed of a house

09:47.921 --> 09:49.623
with a terrace upstairs.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.291
Plant flowers on it,
stuff like that.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.161
Since I was a girl.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.195
Um...

09:55.228 --> 09:57.064
More seriously, though,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.099
a husband that I love.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.133
Roy.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.102
And...

10:02.135 --> 10:04.104
I love to draw.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.739
And I did a little
in college.

10:05.773 --> 10:06.974
And I'd still
love to do something

10:07.007 --> 10:09.910
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.944
She's real good.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.913
You know, the company
is offering

10:12.946 --> 10:15.315
a design training program
in New York.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.950
Well, I have a job
right now.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.652
So I can't really
take time off.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.053
Well, it's--
it's only on weekends.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.188
And then a few weeks
in New York.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.191
But I'm sure that I could
ask corporate to help you out.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.292
Well, it's just that

10:25.325 --> 10:26.927
the weekends aren't good
because, um--

10:26.960 --> 10:29.329
There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.869
Let's start
with the warehouse.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.205
What bothers you as guys?
You know?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.073
My priority is safety.

10:40.107 --> 10:40.941
Okay.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.875
So it really bothers me
when somebody

10:41.909 --> 10:44.077
comes in here speeding around
on a lift,

10:44.111 --> 10:44.878
playing with it
like a toy.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.346
It kind of gets
under my skin, okay?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.181
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.416
Uh-uh, don't--
don't shush me.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.051
I--that was just--

10:51.084 --> 10:51.919
That bothers me too.
I was breathing.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.087
Pam shushes me.
It drives me crazy.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.789
I hate shushing, you know?
That's the thing.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.424
What b--okay.
What is our...

10:57.457 --> 11:00.293
beef as...human men.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.195
You know, that's a good
question, Hasselhoff.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.700
Okay.
What bugs us?

11:06.734 --> 11:07.768
All right, good.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.136
Guys raggin'
on each other.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.339
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.942
All right, let's
talk about...

11:14.975 --> 11:16.343
clothing.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.211
I'm excited about today.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.447
I love girl talk.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.349
Dress for the job you want,

11:22.382 --> 11:23.917
not the job you have.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.252
All right, you can
use your clothing

11:25.285 --> 11:27.087
to send a message
about your ambitions

11:27.120 --> 11:30.758
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.760
I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.394
I'm a professional woman.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.096
The head of accounting.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.365
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.902
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.906
And apparently...
judging from her outfit...

11:45.939 --> 11:47.875
Jan aspires to be a whore.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.878
I hate it
when girls insist

11:50.911 --> 11:52.512
on taking them out
to restaurants

11:52.545 --> 11:54.147
every weekend night,
and then they're like,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.149
"When are we gonna
go on a date date?"

11:56.183 --> 11:57.417
Oh, I hate that, too, man.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.485
Exactly!

11:58.518 --> 12:01.021
That sucks so hard.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.990
And then they make you drive 'em
to church the next morning.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.993
Like, gas ain't free!

12:06.026 --> 12:08.061
Yeah, on our
salaries, man,

12:08.095 --> 12:08.896
what do they expect,
you know?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.330
What, "take us
out every weekend"?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.531
You know what I mean?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.200
We're not millionaires.
I feel you.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.835
No, you don't.
You don't feel us.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.436
How can you?
You

12:16.469 --> 12:18.038
Not literally.

12:18.071 --> 12:18.972
You say we're the same,

12:19.006 --> 12:20.440
but we get compensated
very differently.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.042
Yes.
We work the same
hours as you,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.044
and you just said
we work a lot harder.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.445
Uh, you do, so...

12:25.478 --> 12:27.047
But we get paid
a lot less.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.448
Nn...yy...
Word.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.983
Like, next
to no benefits.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.218
I know.
God, what is that?!

12:31.251 --> 12:32.219
Exactly!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.954
It blows,
it blows, man!

12:33.987 --> 12:35.088
You know,
this would not happen

12:35.122 --> 12:36.256
if we had a union.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.891
That's what
I'm talking about.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.127
Yeah...no.
Absolutely,
that's what we need.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.162
Man, see, that's what
I been sayin', man.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.064
We need to do this finally.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.132
You know what?
Is that necessary?

12:45.165 --> 12:48.135
'Cause you already sort of
have a union of guys.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.870
It's more than necessary,
Mike.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.873
We need this.
Roy...you still have that card

12:52.906 --> 12:54.107
from the dock worker's
union?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.542
Dock workers?
Man, hook him up.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.810
Come on, man!

12:56.844 --> 12:57.945
Yeah.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.279
You know what, I think, uh--

12:59.312 --> 13:00.447
Problem is the chicks.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.582
Union, yeah!
The problem
is the chicks.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.551
And you gotta blame them.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.888
Are you with us, Mike?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.556
Yeah, s...

13:09.589 --> 13:11.424
Welcome to the warehouse.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.292
Mi-chael!

13:12.325 --> 13:15.428
Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!

13:16.463 --> 13:19.232
Another issue
is inequality of pay

13:19.266 --> 13:20.567
between men and women.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.402
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.437
This is important.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.505
Ladies, take a breather.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.375
Jan, I, uh...

13:28.408 --> 13:30.978
wanted...

13:31.011 --> 13:32.012
Can I help you?

13:34.014 --> 13:36.349
Um, I wanted to say
that the guys downstairs

13:36.383 --> 13:38.118
are thinking about
forming a union.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.987
And they have
some good points.
What

13:40.020 --> 13:40.988
Don't get hysterical.
I'm not.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.391
Part of my job
is knowing how to talk to women.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.427
Let's...be...
rational...here.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.596
What are the pros,
what are the cons?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.965
The cons are that everyone
will lose their job, Michael.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.335
Everyone.
Office, warehouse.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.438
What do you think
the...pros...are...here?

13:58.471 --> 14:01.141
Don't talk to me
that way, please.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.111
Just...they're gonna
wanna hear this from you.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.913
Oh, you got yourself
into this, Michael,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
so you get yourself out.
Well, we're bonding
down there.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.649
I just don't wanna
have to tell them something

14:09.682 --> 14:10.817
they're not gonna
wanna hear!

14:10.850 --> 14:13.020
Now who's getting
hysterical?
Okay.
Come on, Jan.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.154
After all we've
been through.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.488
Michael, Michael--
We have history.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.090
We have a history.
Michael.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.258
Between us.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.960
Don't say another word.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.063
Get...yourself...
down...stairs.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.164
I'm just saying
that we have something--

14:24.197 --> 14:26.099
Okay, whatever.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.437
You know what?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.039
We could get this done
a lot quicker

14:32.072 --> 14:33.640
if we formed
a type of assembly line.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.077
This here is
a run-out-the-clock situation.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.013
Just like upstairs.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.648
Sports metaphors

14:41.681 --> 14:42.983
are one of the ways
women feel left out

14:43.016 --> 14:44.151
of the language
of the office.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.919
Now, I know this
might sound silly,

14:45.953 --> 14:47.320
but many women
ask to go over it.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.422
So...fumble means--

14:49.456 --> 14:51.158
Mistake.
Slip.
Right.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.593
Par for the course
is a golf term.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.328
It means right on track.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.198
Uh, below par
means worse.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.567
Wait, that should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.668
What about second base?

15:01.701 --> 15:05.638
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.507
Does that mean you
had closed a deal?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.708
Excuse me?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.111
I mean, that's
a baseball term, right?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.980
I don't know what...
Michael was...

15:13.013 --> 15:14.581
talking about,
I don't know.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.983
Like, you went to Chili's,

15:16.016 --> 15:17.517
and he got
to second base with you.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.019
Excuse me.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.387
Kelly, I don't know
what Michael was talking about.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.990
He just told everybody,
and I just wanna know...

15:23.023 --> 15:24.091
Hey.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.325
Hey!

15:25.358 --> 15:26.693
How's it going
down there?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.228
It's a complete d--
Well, actually,

15:28.261 --> 15:29.429
it's exactly
what you'd expect, so...

15:29.462 --> 15:30.430
Right.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.965
How are the girls?
Good.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.367
We watched a video about
our changing bodies.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.602
Did you really?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.070
No.
Oh.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.972
Almost.

15:39.006 --> 15:42.142
Um, but, hey, um...
something kind of cool.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.444
There's this internship
in graphic design

15:44.477 --> 15:46.113
that Jan was
telling us about.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.581
She made it sound, like,
really great.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.583
Nice.
Well, what's it all about?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.485
I think you should do it.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.987
That's great.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.089
It's really cool.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.426
Cold front comin' in
to the warehouse!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.760
Uh-oh!

16:00.793 --> 16:03.230
Better put on
your ski boots!

16:04.797 --> 16:07.600
Wooooow!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.770
Happy New Year, Darrell!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.672
Hey, Darrell!

16:14.141 --> 16:16.009
You ever done this?

16:18.145 --> 16:19.246
Are you married?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.114
I'm divorced.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
That must have been hard.
It was.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.916
Yes.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.253
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

16:26.286 --> 16:29.056
and that's why you
did that thing with Michael.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.590
I think you should all spend
a little more time

16:30.623 --> 16:33.126
thinking about your careers
and less time on personal stuff.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.662
Mmm, I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.330
At least you
don't have kids.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.732
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.569
Okay, let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.507
How can someone
so beautiful be so sad?

16:50.443 --> 16:51.644
Hi.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.146
Did you take care
of the situation?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.214
Yeah, yeah.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.783
Yes, I...
I have...essentially--

16:56.816 --> 16:58.818
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yes, I've take--

16:58.851 --> 17:01.088
I'm told that there's
been some interest

17:01.121 --> 17:03.323
in forming a union,
and that Michael supported it.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.358
Obviously he's not
a friend of yours,

17:05.392 --> 17:06.659
because he didn't
tell you the facts.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.628
So let me.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.797
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.800
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.834
They unionized
in Pittsfield,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.803
and we all know
what happened in Pittsfield.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.439
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees

17:19.472 --> 17:21.208
and union dues,
and that'll be nothing

17:21.241 --> 17:22.742
compared to the cost
of losing your jobs.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.612
So I would think
long and hard before

17:25.645 --> 17:27.414
sacrificing your savings
and your futures

17:27.447 --> 17:29.716
just to send a message.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.084
If you have
any further questions,

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
you can direct them to...

17:34.421 --> 17:35.555
To Michael.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.095
Dreams are just that.
They're dreams.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.131
They help get you
through the day.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.265
Like the thing
about the terrace.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.866
It's nice.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.735
But, um...
I don't know.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.238
It was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.440
Uh, the girl in the book
has a terrace

17:53.473 --> 17:55.108
outside of her bedroom.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.644
And she planted flowers
on it.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.646
And I just loved that.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.714
Just always kind of
stuck with me.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.217
So you're not doing it?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.420
How did you know?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.556
Why not?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.858
Just not--
no big reason.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.160
Just a bunch
of little reasons.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.794
Come on.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
Roy's right.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.398
There's no guarantee it's
gonna lead to anything anyway.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.267
Roy said that?

18:20.300 --> 18:24.337
What? You have
something you wanna say?

18:24.371 --> 18:29.142
You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.911
I mean, do you wanna
be a receptionist here, always?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.246
Oh, excuse me!

18:33.280 --> 18:34.914
I'm fine with my choices.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.217
You are?

18:37.250 --> 18:40.487
Yeah.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.754
It's impractical.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.924
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.328
Um, they don't even make houses
like that in Scranton.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.862
So I'm never gonna...

18:57.204 --> 18:58.771
Just gonna push this
over there!

19:00.840 --> 19:03.176
This is not a good idea
right here.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.447
Easy does it. Okay.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.787
Pizza.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.956
Great equalizer.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.759
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.195
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.199
Do black people
like pizza?

19:36.008 --> 19:39.279
Hey...um...

19:39.312 --> 19:40.613
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.216
Sometimes, Jan...

19:43.250 --> 19:44.851
can be such a bitch.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.988
Hey, watch it.
Watch it.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.623
We have a relationship.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.659
Thank you to our hosts.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.926
Hey, Michael!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.795
This ain't over.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.838
Excellent.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.973
Is it good to be back?
Yeah.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.941
I mean,
I love the guy stuff, but...

20:08.975 --> 20:11.411
to run an office,
you need men and women.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.479
You know why?

20:12.512 --> 20:16.316
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

20:16.349 --> 20:18.318
to keep things interesting.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.431
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.734
Uh, hold, please.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.542
Snow angel!
Snow angel!

20:44.444 --> 20:46.446
