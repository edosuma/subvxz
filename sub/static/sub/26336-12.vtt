00:01.535 --> 00:03.136
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...
Hey, Grace.

00:03.136 --> 00:04.304
I’m Steve.

00:04.304 --> 00:05.939
Your dad talks
about you all the time.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.741
He talks about you a lot, too.

00:07.741 --> 00:08.942
(laughs)

00:08.942 --> 00:11.144
Daddy!
Aw, come here, monkey.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.648
And I realized the
only way this place

00:14.648 --> 00:15.949
would be tolerable

00:15.949 --> 00:18.452
is ’cause I’d get
to be here with you.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.653
GRACE:
It’s bad enough I’m grounded

00:19.653 --> 00:20.921
on Halloween.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.556
Why do I need a babysitter?
I’m 14.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.105
(knocking on door)

00:41.842 --> 00:43.777
(knocking continues)

00:55.155 --> 00:58.091
Hey.
Hi. Look, I’m sorry.
I know I should have called,

00:58.091 --> 00:59.793
but I-I was in a panic,

00:59.793 --> 01:01.261
so I just jumped in the car
and came straight here.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.397
Okay, come on, come on. Come in.
What are you talking about?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.731
What’s the matter?
What’s going on?

01:04.731 --> 01:06.500
Uh, it-it’s Grace.
She didn’t come home.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.936
Come home from where?
She drove to a party,

01:08.936 --> 01:10.504
but she knows
her curfew is midnight.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.506
I woke up at 2:00,
and she wasn’t back.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.708
And I have been trying
her phone, but she won’t answer.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.944
Okay. Okay. Um, look.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.912
L-Let’s just calm down.
Everything’s fine, I’m sure,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.714
but I’m just gonna have HPD
run a trace on her phone,

01:20.714 --> 01:23.083
put a BOLO out on her car.
You got your plate number

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
in your head, by any chance?
No, she wasn’t driving my car.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.720
Well, whose car was she driving?

01:26.720 --> 01:29.923
Stan bought Grace a car
two weeks ago.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.992
It doesn’t have plates yet.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.794
I see.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.362
Hang on. Okay.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.997
(phone beeps)

01:38.899 --> 01:40.701
Hey. Yeah, this is
Detective Williams.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.271
I need you to run a trace
on a phone for me, please.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.079
DANNY:
Two miles off the freeway.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.480
Rachel, this has got to be it.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.581
Did we pass it?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.749
Because...
No, this is it.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.219
Danny, what would she

01:59.219 --> 02:00.721
be doing out here?

02:01.822 --> 02:04.558
Oh, my God, Danny.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.461
Oh, no, Grace.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.363
Oh, no.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.666
Danny.
Is my daughter in there?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.668
Grace!
Yeah, it’s her.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.936
How bad is it, man? Come on!
Grace!

02:15.936 --> 02:17.671
Come on, how bad is it?
Grace!

02:17.671 --> 02:19.106
Grace!
Rachel!

02:19.106 --> 02:20.407
(siren wailing)

02:20.407 --> 02:21.675
(screams)
We’re going to the hospital.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.644
(crying)

02:23.644 --> 02:26.880
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song playing)

03:00.414 --> 03:03.050
Hey.

03:03.050 --> 03:06.019
I know. I know.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.589
You all right? You all right?

03:09.589 --> 03:13.126
What’s going on?
Uh, she’s, uh, she’s
in critical condition.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.328
And there was another
kid in the car, and she’s

03:15.328 --> 03:17.130
pretty bad off, too,
so it’s not good, Steve.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.298
All right.
All right, all right.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.435
Rachel.
Hi.

03:21.435 --> 03:25.038
You okay? Who’s the kid?
Who’s this other...?
(exhales)

03:25.038 --> 03:26.173
We’re not... we’re not sure.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.308
I mean, she’s a new girl
in Grace’s class,

03:28.308 --> 03:30.210
but, I mean, they
were at a party.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.079
Maybe Grace was giving
her a ride home.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.281
We just...
we don’t even know anything.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.982
MAN:
Williams?

03:35.982 --> 03:38.552
You’re Grace’s parents, right?
RACHEL:
Yes.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.455
Yeah, I’m Katie’s dad.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.824
The girl your daughter put
in intensive care.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.526
Katie has
a collapsed lung.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.329
Broken ribs.
Her leg is shattered.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.831
But you’re not
blaming this on Grace.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.466
She was driving.
DANNY:
Okay, that’s enough.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.733
Like a lunatic,
judging by

03:53.733 --> 03:54.734
Katie’s injuries.
STEVE:
Okay, okay.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.636
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.904
Sir, we’re very sorry
about your daughter,

03:57.904 --> 03:59.239
but this is not the time
or the place.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.474
Did you even bother to teach her

04:00.474 --> 04:02.242
how to drive?
Okay, that’s enough.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.343
Or does Cop Dad
just bail her out

04:03.343 --> 04:05.078
every time
she drives home drunk

04:05.078 --> 04:06.446
from a party?
Okay. All right.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.148
God help you if Katie dies.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.916
DANNY:
Shut your mouth! Shut your...
Oh, or what?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.551
Shut your mouth.
You’ll do the same to me?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.320
That’s my daughter.
Get out of here.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.721
That’s my daughter in there.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.256
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
(indistinct shouting)

04:16.256 --> 04:17.257
Take him downstairs.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
Cool him out
downstairs.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.897
Steve.
What?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.799
I need to talk to you.
What?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.634
HPD’s opened an investigation.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.469
Into what?
They had no choice.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.904
The damage to Grace’s car
suggests she was going

04:30.904 --> 04:33.740
almost double the speed limit.
What are you talking about?

04:33.740 --> 04:36.076
They have to follow protocol.
A tox screen’s been ordered,

04:36.076 --> 04:39.479
and vehicle homicide’s coming
in to do an assessment.
VHS?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.481
We’re talking
about Grace Williams.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.250
You know this girl.
It’s not her.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.752
Something’s wrong here.
I’m sorry, Steve.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.687
I’m sorry.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.429
(motor running)

05:00.267 --> 05:01.802
(intercom beeps)

05:01.802 --> 05:05.005
WOMAN: Dr. Lin, you have
a visitor in the main lobby.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.340
Dr. Lin, a visitor
in the main lobby.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.642
RACHEL:
You’re going to wear

05:08.642 --> 05:10.677
a hole in the floor.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.679
Grace is not responsible
for that accident,

05:12.679 --> 05:15.115
I’m telling you right now.
Yeah, we know that.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.717
And Steve has promised to
find out exactly what happened.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.554
And in the meantime,
all we can do is just be here

05:20.554 --> 05:22.489
for when Grace wakes up,
which she will.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.524
Uh-huh.

05:24.524 --> 05:27.794
Mr. and Mrs. Williams?
Hi.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.296
Hey. What’s going on?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.131
The good news
is there’s no damage

05:31.131 --> 05:32.866
to Grace’s internal organs.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.936
But she does have
a depressed skull fracture,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.772
which we need to operate on
as soon as possible.
(sighs)

05:38.772 --> 05:40.207
A-All right. What exactly

05:40.207 --> 05:41.942
does that mean?
It means

05:41.942 --> 05:43.777
the injury to her skull
is putting pressure

05:43.777 --> 05:45.212
on her brain.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.314
We’re calling in
a neurosurgeon

05:47.314 --> 05:48.748
and a surgical team,
but we won’t

05:48.748 --> 05:50.250
know the extent of the damage

05:50.250 --> 05:52.752
until we get in there.
All right, well, what...
So, when do we know?

05:52.752 --> 05:54.888
So, how long does
that take or...?
It could be a while.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.857
Did you get a pager
from the nurses’ station?

05:56.857 --> 06:00.160
Yeah. This-this thing here?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.695
Wherever you are
in the hospital, that pager

06:01.695 --> 06:03.964
will go off as soon as we have
an update for you.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.399
Yeah, I’ve ordered a
cheeseburger before.
Danny.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.870
Thank you.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.973
Hang in there.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.241
We’ll see you guys soon.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.070
Do you want to talk
about the car?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.906
Because I know
that you’re mad about it.

06:46.906 --> 06:50.510
Uh, no, I-I don’t want to talk
about the car, Rachel.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.911
I’m not mad.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.381
Well, I know that you are,
because, you know, I would be.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.449
I just told you I’m not
mad about it, Rachel.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.318
You should have told me
about it. You didn’t.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.519
Right.
It’s over.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.521
But Stan didn’t ask me.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.894
So the car just...
Did it just magically appear?

07:07.894 --> 07:10.930
No. He did it
because he feels guilty

07:10.930 --> 07:12.565
about having moved to Vegas.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.635
And I just... I couldn’t
just return it, because...

07:15.635 --> 07:17.370
(chuckles):
I mean, you...

07:17.370 --> 07:19.372
you should have seen
Grace’s face.

07:19.372 --> 07:23.109
I didn’t see her face, Rachel.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.746
I didn’t,
and that moment’s gone now.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.484
It’s just that she wanted
to tell you,

07:31.484 --> 07:34.688
and, you know, she knew that
you would be upset about it,

07:34.688 --> 07:37.624
so she-she kept
putting it off.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.559
So I just wanted to tell you
that I’m sorry.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.928
I heard you, Rachel.
You’re sorry.

07:41.928 --> 07:42.929
I accept your apology.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.297
Okay? I forgive you.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.632
All right?
I-I’ll write it down,

07:45.632 --> 07:47.434
and then we’ll take it,
and we’ll get it notarized.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.035
Is that good?
You happy with that?

07:49.035 --> 07:51.237
No. I’m just trying
to help you understand.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.573
Understand what, Rachel?
Understand what?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.408
That it’s not your fault?
I got it.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.609
It’s never your fault.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.677
There’s all kinds of
things that happen

07:57.677 --> 07:58.812
that you should have
told me about

07:58.812 --> 07:59.846
that you don’t
tell me about.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.214
I’m used to it, all right?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.750
I’m used to it.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.151
I’m gonna get a coffee.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.093
(sighs)

08:15.495 --> 08:17.464
Koa, come on, open the door.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.599
Come on. Please.

08:19.599 --> 08:20.800
(rustling inside)

08:20.800 --> 08:24.337
I can hear you in there.
Open it.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.673
(sighs)

08:26.673 --> 08:28.608
(lock clicking)

08:30.477 --> 08:31.177
What the hell?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.412
I don’t want to talk about it.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.080
What happened?
Who did that to you?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.915
I’m fine.
Don’t worry about it.

08:35.915 --> 08:38.518
Before you ask, yes,
I’m still clean.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.554
And no, I don’t need you
solving any more of my problems.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.224
(groans)
I can handle it.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.897
You know, you were never
a burden to me, Koa.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.732
Not when you were using,
and not now.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.634
I just want to help you.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.202
Would you let me help you?

08:57.670 --> 09:00.173
I went out looking for Alana.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.941
She’s one of the addicts
I’ve been counseling

09:01.941 --> 09:03.343
at the rehab facility.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.246
She went missing.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.115
Okay. Did she... did she
just walk out, or...

09:09.115 --> 09:11.618
No, I discharged her a week ago.

09:11.618 --> 09:15.021
She was inpatient for opiates,
but she completed her treatment,

09:15.021 --> 09:17.457
was doing well,
so we sent her home.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.428
She’s supposed to check in with
me every night at 6:00 p.m.,

09:21.428 --> 09:22.962
but last night, she didn’t.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.065
Okay. And so you went
looking for her

09:25.065 --> 09:27.167
at all her favorite
underground fight clubs?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.435
Oh, ha ha.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.004
No. When I found out
she wasn’t home,

09:31.004 --> 09:33.473
I got worried she relapsed.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.842
(sighs) So I went to see
her douchebag ex, Dillon.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.244
Alana broke up with him
when she got clean.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.146
And whenever he came to rehab
looking for her,

09:40.146 --> 09:41.381
I didn’t let him in.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.851
So the guy’s not exactly
my biggest fan.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.622
Right, okay, so he
did that to you, then?

09:49.622 --> 09:51.491
Yeah.
(sighs)

09:51.491 --> 09:54.327
But that’s not
the worst part.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.663
He had that smug look
on his face,

09:56.663 --> 09:58.832
like there was something he knew
and wasn’t telling me.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.568
All right, I mean,
I’ll go talk to him,

10:01.568 --> 10:04.304
see what he knows
about your patient.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.274
What?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.876
You gonna talk to him the way
you talked to Kenny Hong?

10:09.876 --> 10:12.312
I hear his shoulder
still gives him problems.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.746
Koa, this is a suspect.

10:13.746 --> 10:17.584
This isn’t your
middle-school bully. Okay?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.018
I’m a cop now.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.820
I’ll keep it professional.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.188
(grunts)

10:22.188 --> 10:23.523
What the hell?!

10:23.523 --> 10:25.058
Sorry. Were you not
finished ’gramming

10:25.058 --> 10:26.526
your avocado toast yet?

10:26.526 --> 10:28.361
My apologies.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.596
(both grunt)

10:30.897 --> 10:32.599
I’m gonna need some answers
to the questions

10:32.599 --> 10:33.800
my brother was asking.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.268
Your brother?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.871
Oh. Mr. Rehab ran
to his sister for help.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.340
That’s cute.
Where’s Alana?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.842
Tell me, has your brother
always been such a drag?

10:42.842 --> 10:45.111
Or was he less boring
back when he partied?

10:45.111 --> 10:46.179
(yells)

10:46.179 --> 10:49.082
Oh, you want to
jump in with a cop?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.351
You want to jump in?
Let’s go, do it! Do it!

10:52.619 --> 10:54.020
You’re lucky
you’ve got that badge.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.789
Would you prefer I take it off?
That’s a good idea.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.592
Here you go.
No badge.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.928
I’m not a cop, all right?
Your move.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.229
Well, if you’re not a cop,

11:03.229 --> 11:05.331
that means I don’t have
to answer your questions.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.799
Oh, yeah, you’re right.

11:06.799 --> 11:09.035
It also means
that I don’t have to worry

11:09.035 --> 11:10.503
about using excessive force.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.173
(excited chatter, woman screams)

11:14.173 --> 11:16.442
FYI, I would call this
"moderate force."

11:16.442 --> 11:17.877
Fine! I saw Alana, okay?

11:17.877 --> 11:20.046
She came by my house
a couple days ago.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.915
She was clean,
spouting some BS

11:21.915 --> 11:24.517
about making amends,
and then she left. That’s all.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.588
(grunts)

11:28.588 --> 11:30.290
Many thanks, Dillon.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.459
Enjoy the rest
of your brunch.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.064
Why would Alana want
to make amends with this guy?

11:38.064 --> 11:40.166
(grunts)
It’s part of the program.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.801
You put together
an "amends list."

11:41.801 --> 11:44.337
Reach out to the people who
were affected by your addiction.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.573
Okay, I’m gonna pull
her cell phone records.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.907
That’ll give us
a pretty good idea

11:47.907 --> 11:49.676
of who she was planning
on reaching out to.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.445
Maybe one of those people
she was gonna reconnect with

11:52.445 --> 11:54.881
knows something.
What am I supposed to do,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.783
sit here watching
my stitches dissolve?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.685
Yeah, Koa, you’re not a cop,

11:58.685 --> 12:00.053
so...

12:00.053 --> 12:01.921
Although, I...

12:01.921 --> 12:04.457
I suppose that you
would know some of the names

12:04.457 --> 12:06.092
on that list from, uh,

12:06.092 --> 12:08.561
your time as her counselor.
I’ll be outside.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.396
Right.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.399
DANNY:
We got, uh...

12:13.399 --> 12:14.534
no news.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.969
Uh, they only just
started operating.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.404
So actually there is some news:
the tox screen

12:18.404 --> 12:21.307
came back negative.
Yeah, of course it did--
it’s Gracie

12:21.307 --> 12:22.709
we’re talking
about here, Danny.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.311
(sighs): Listen, uh...
we’re almost at the scene,

12:25.311 --> 12:27.880
but I’m gonna hit you back as
soon as we got something, okay?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.849
All right. Thanks, buddy.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.521
JUNIOR:
Hey, so there’s no news
on Grace yet.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.857
I would have called you
if I heard anything.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.159
Yeah, I know, I know.
I just...

12:40.159 --> 12:44.197
I feel bad not being there,
and I don’t want to bother Danny

12:44.197 --> 12:47.267
by calling incessantly.
Okay, but you don’t mind
bothering me?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.434
Not in the slightest.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.535
(chuckles)

12:49.535 --> 12:51.170
Hey, uh, how’s Koa doing?

12:51.170 --> 12:52.405
He’s fine.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.374
You should see the other guy.
Yeah?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.043
Hey, I got to go.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.244
I’ll call you later, okay?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.083
Junior.
Hey.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.752
Walk us through this.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.755
Okay, so, HPD found
that around 2:00 a.m.

13:08.755 --> 13:12.525
Grace missed this turn
going 80 miles an hour.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.594
GROVER: What?
Yeah, before she
could even brake,

13:14.594 --> 13:15.962
she’d hit the embankment
and flipped.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.799
80? On this road?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.468
Well, that makes
no damn sense at all,

13:22.468 --> 13:24.237
especially due to the
fact that she was sober.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.605
STEVE:
You see these?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.206
GROVER:
Yeah, I see ’em.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.375
If she never had a chance
to brake, then these ain’t hers.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.444
Not to mention, this car
wasn’t skidding off the road

13:31.444 --> 13:33.012
or swerving--
it was going fast,

13:33.012 --> 13:35.381
and then it came to
a stop right here.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.954
(sighs)
This oil is fresh.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.890
This car had an oil leak.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.494
Hey, Caps.
Yeah?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.263
How’s Danny doing?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.865
Well, Danny’s
a tough nut, but...

13:52.865 --> 13:55.535
he loses Grace, man,
I... (exhales)

13:55.535 --> 13:57.670
I don’t want
to think about it.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.305
Hey, yo.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.673
GROVER:
Yep?

14:02.075 --> 14:04.711
These tire indents are fresh,
too. And look at this.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.213
JUNIOR:
There’s a whole bunch
of fresh oil as well.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.948
Okay, so it looks
like the driver

14:08.948 --> 14:11.384
must have idled here for
at least a few minutes.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.119
This has got to be
the same driver

14:13.119 --> 14:14.287
that stopped
back there, right?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.823
Well, Joon,
I’ll tell you what.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.626
This person stopped suddenly
right at this crash scene,

14:20.626 --> 14:23.596
then pulls up and pulls over,

14:23.596 --> 14:26.165
stays here for a minute,
takes off,

14:26.165 --> 14:28.701
never calls 911--
why do you think that is?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.603
The only reason
I can think of is

14:30.603 --> 14:33.039
that they’re responsible
for this accident.
Boom.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.241
Let’s get CSU up here.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.744
This just became a crime scene.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.519
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Paging Dr. Stateman.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.854
Dr. Stateman, please.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.323
Thank you both so much.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.624
Least we could
do, sistah.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.059
You’ve been through
enough today.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.228
You shouldn’t have to add
hospital food to the list.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.029
Yeah, I’m just...

14:57.029 --> 14:59.398
afraid I don’t have
much of an appetite right now.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.200
You should eat
something, Rachel.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.503
Yes, I know I should
eat something, Danny.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.739
Mommy.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.574
Hi, baby. Hi.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.042
Where’s Grace?

15:10.042 --> 15:12.411
Hey, buddy.
Uh, Grace is, uh... she’s with

15:12.411 --> 15:14.547
the doctors, and they’re
taking really good care of her

15:14.547 --> 15:17.216
right now, but I think that it’s
gonna be very boring here today,

15:17.216 --> 15:19.118
so maybe you
want to hang out

15:19.118 --> 15:20.686
with Auntie Noelani
today, or what?

15:20.686 --> 15:23.322
Oh, sorry, you know what?
My schedule’s packed.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.891
I got to eat an
ice cream sundae,

15:24.891 --> 15:27.260
then I got to go build the
new Lego City fire station...

15:27.260 --> 15:29.128
I like Legos and ice cream.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.963
You do? Well, you
want to hang?

15:30.963 --> 15:32.265
(laughs):
Good.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.299
DANNY:
Hey.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.534
Say good-bye to Mama, all right?

15:36.068 --> 15:38.738
All right, so, this bag
has Grace’s stuff,

15:38.738 --> 15:40.606
and this one’s
for Rachel.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.408
Thank you.
Of course.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.710
All right, buddy,
beat it. Have fun.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.979
This is for you.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.247
What’s this?
It’s just some stuff.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.415
I mean, you’re
wearing flip-flops,

15:49.415 --> 15:51.684
so I had Noelani grab you
a couple things.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.753
Toothbrush, toothpaste,

15:53.753 --> 15:55.988
that sweatshirt of mine
that you really like.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.428
(sighs)

16:02.428 --> 16:04.564
(phone ringing)
Thank you.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.065
Yeah. It was actually a shock

16:06.065 --> 16:08.334
that you didn’t try
to take that in the divorce.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.969
Steve, what’s up?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.472
Hey, Danny, listen to me.
Don’t ask any questions.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.774
Just start walking
towards the visitors lounge.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.309
If you leave now,
you should be there

16:16.309 --> 16:18.211
in about 30 seconds--
you’re pretty close.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.079
What’s going on?
Are you up on my phone?

16:20.079 --> 16:22.014
Listen to me, all right?
We ran Grace’s phone.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.150
She received
a threatening text message

16:24.150 --> 16:26.052
before the crash last night.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.486
Turn right there
at the nurses’ station.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.888
Keep going down the hall.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.823
What are you talking about?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.325
The number is listed
to a Nathan Cowell.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.026
We just pinged Nathan’s phone,

16:34.026 --> 16:35.695
and he’s in that hospital
right now.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.863
Okay. Where? Where?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.531
You turn right
into that next room.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.366
He should be standing
right in front of you.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.003
Hey.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.504
Who’s Nathan?

16:45.504 --> 16:47.139
Um, it’s me.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.441
Get up. Get up.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.943
Come on.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.178
Have a seat.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.182
You know who I am?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.184
Okay. You got
five seconds,

16:58.184 --> 17:00.553
five seconds to tell me
why you sent my daughter

17:00.553 --> 17:02.989
a threatening text message
and what you are doing here.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.790
Okay? That is me being generous.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.293
You understand?
Mr. Williams, I can explain.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.561
Okay, good.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.866
It’s so awful what happened
to Grace and Katie.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.536
I started a hashtag in
their honor to raise awareness

17:16.536 --> 17:18.037
about safe driving.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.006
"Bitch, you’ll pay
for what you did"?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.610
That’s the text
that you sent

17:24.610 --> 17:26.779
to Grace Williams
late last night.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.149
You were saying?

17:30.149 --> 17:32.318
That’s disgusting.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.086
I would never send
a text like that.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.088
Is that right?
MAN:
Excuse me,

17:36.088 --> 17:38.457
but I don’t appreciate you
implying my daughter’s a liar.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.592
Besides, Cameron
dropped her phone

17:39.592 --> 17:41.594
in the pool
at the party last night,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.062
so she couldn’t have
sent those texts.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.163
Oh, no, no, no.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.299
She didn’t send them
from her phone.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.234
She sent them from
Nathan Cowell’s phone,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.670
right after her and
Grace had a fight.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.306
What’s the matter?
You forgot to put that in your

17:53.306 --> 17:55.508
"this is what happened at the
party last night, Dad" report

17:55.508 --> 17:57.076
that you gave him?

17:57.076 --> 18:01.847
Frankly, I’m beginning to feel
a little persecuted right now.

18:01.847 --> 18:05.151
(laughs) Well, I guess we can
take that as a yes.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.487
How about I fill in some
of the blanks for you, Mr. Ross?

18:08.487 --> 18:11.190
We have Grace Williams.
Very nice girl.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.758
Her father’s in law enforcement.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.628
And she goes to a party,
at which your daughter

18:15.628 --> 18:17.096
is also in attendance,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.966
when, suddenly, she sees Cameron
in a corner with her phone,

18:19.966 --> 18:21.934
showing it to her friends.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.236
So Grace thinks, "Boy, I’d like
to get in on that fun.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.538
That looks like fun."

18:25.538 --> 18:27.340
Only she gets over there
and she finds out

18:27.340 --> 18:29.775
there’s nothing funny
about it at all.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.745
See, there’s a new girl
in school; her name’s Katie.

18:32.745 --> 18:36.048
And a year ago,
she made the tragic mistake of

18:36.048 --> 18:38.884
taking an intimate photo
for her boyfriend.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.354
And you know what
Prince Charming does?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.222
He takes that photo

18:43.222 --> 18:46.425
and uploads it to the Internet
for everybody to see.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.694
And Katie got so bullied

18:48.694 --> 18:51.130
she had to switch schools.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.266
So now she’s at school
with Grace and your daughter.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.135
Fresh start, right?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.004
Wrong.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.472
Because Cameron here decided

18:59.472 --> 19:01.807
she’d go and dig that picture up
on the Internet.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.109
Didn’t you?

19:03.109 --> 19:05.711
And then you downloaded it
to your phone.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.513
And then you started
showing it around

19:07.513 --> 19:09.115
to all your friends
at the party.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.184
Meanwhile, Katie is in a corner
somewhere crying, so humiliated,

19:12.184 --> 19:14.186
and Grace didn’t like that,
either, did she?

19:14.186 --> 19:16.555
So she took your phone,

19:16.555 --> 19:19.158
and she dropped it
in a guy’s beer.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.527
And that’s when Cameron
took Nathan’s phone

19:21.527 --> 19:25.531
and sent these insults
and threatening texts to Grace.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.400
Now we’re all caught up.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.435
Is this true?

19:32.038 --> 19:33.639
Fine.

19:33.639 --> 19:36.042
I had a little fun
with Katie. Whatever.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.045
Grace got super extra
about it for no reason.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.613
Katie took that photo herself.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.114
It’s her own fault it got out.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.151
I was pissed about my phone.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.920
So, yeah, I sent Grace
those texts.
STEVE: Mm-hmm.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.189
And then you followed Grace and
Katie after the party, right?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.258
What? No.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.094
No, they left, and a few
minutes later, I did, too.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.328
I was home by midnight.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.197
At-at least that part’s true.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.099
I-I always wait up for her.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.701
GROVER: Hang on a second.
Let me get this straight.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.770
So you’re telling us
that Katie and Grace

20:04.770 --> 20:06.772
left the party before midnight.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.007
You’re sure?

20:08.007 --> 20:09.108
(cell phone ringing)

20:11.043 --> 20:12.678
The accident didn’t
happen until 2:00 a.m.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.247
STEVE:
Excuse me.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.615
Yeah, Junior, what’s up?

20:16.615 --> 20:19.518
Sir, CSU ran the skid marks
and the oil from the scene

20:19.518 --> 20:20.920
against Cameron’s Audi.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.488
Let me guess, it wasn’t a match.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.556
JUNIOR:
Right. But get this.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.191
The oil that we found
at the scene

20:25.191 --> 20:26.459
is not your standard stuff.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.927
It’s a high-zinc oil.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.362
High-zinc oil?
That’s for older engines.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.198
So, what are we thinking?
Our perp was driving

20:32.198 --> 20:33.265
something pre-’70s?

20:33.265 --> 20:34.300
Looks like it.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.168
All right. Thanks, Junior.

20:38.537 --> 20:39.805
GROVER:
Well, that Cameron’s

20:39.805 --> 20:41.974
a bully and a jerk,
but she ain’t our perp.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.810
Yeah, and if she’s right, and
Grace and Katie left that party

20:44.810 --> 20:48.013
at a quarter to 12:00, what were
those girls doing for two hours?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.583
Yeah. Hmm.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.718
Okay, you’re 18 years old,

20:52.718 --> 20:55.888
you got a couple hours to kill
after a party. What do you do?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.023
You... do what they all do.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.059
They all go look
for something to eat.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.495
I’ll have Junior check out
the late-night food joints.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.796
All right.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.764
(sighs)

21:06.765 --> 21:08.601
What if this is
out of battery?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.002
It’s not out of
batteries, Rachel.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.537
They just checked
it for me twice.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.874
All right, well, then,
maybe no news is good.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.208
Maybe that means

21:16.208 --> 21:18.577
that there aren’t
any problems.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.614
And that’s that.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.857
Do you remember
when Grace was born

21:31.857 --> 21:33.626
they told us
that we could go home,

21:33.626 --> 21:35.227
and you did not want to leave?

21:35.227 --> 21:38.030
You made them track down our
doctor so you could double-check

21:38.030 --> 21:40.966
that it was safe
to leave the hospital.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.840
What?

21:47.840 --> 21:49.842
Nothing.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.310
What’s-what’s that face?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
Nothing. I locked
the keys in the car.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.647
I locked the keys in the car.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.282
I went down to get
Grace’s car seat,

21:56.282 --> 21:58.684
and I locked the keys
in the car that day.

21:58.684 --> 21:59.985
And you never told me that.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.520
I wouldn’t tell you.
I was embarrassed.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.522
I felt like an idiot, okay?

22:03.522 --> 22:06.192
I was stalling until the
Triple-A guy showed up.

22:06.192 --> 22:10.896
You got that nurse to show you
how to swaddle about ten times.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.598
She thought
you were a total moron.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.768
She was right.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.937
(pager buzzes, beeps)

22:21.140 --> 22:22.775
Hey.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.343
What’s going on?
Sorry,

22:24.343 --> 22:25.778
but there’s been a complication.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.179
What do you mean?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.114
A hemorrhage.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.550
The team is doing everything
that they can for her,

22:31.550 --> 22:33.118
but she is still in surgery.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.954
Okay. All right.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.089
So we’ll just... we’ll
just hang out, then, yeah?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.159
We just have to wait.
Okay.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.061
All right.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.896
ADAM:
Just spoke to HPD.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.164
They checked Alana’s house.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.866
Didn’t find anything,
including Alana.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.701
All right, well, hopefully,
you’ll have more luck

22:48.701 --> 22:49.835
running down the names in

22:49.835 --> 22:50.903
her cell phone
records.

22:50.903 --> 22:51.971
Yeah, not so much.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.706
Same story every time.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.307
Alana called to make amends.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.842
Seemed happy and healthy,
but still,

22:56.842 --> 22:58.844
no one knows
where she might be now.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.145
Sounds familiar.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.948
Okay, well, we’re headed
to the next name on the list--

23:02.948 --> 23:04.483
Kelsey Yang.
Koa says

23:04.483 --> 23:05.751
it’s a friend of Alana’s.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.086
So we’ll just
check in with you later.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.254
Copy that.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.455
(phone beeps)

23:09.455 --> 23:11.123
I still can’t
believe it.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.759
Alana’s come
such a long way.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.462
She checked herself into rehab
to detox off the oxy.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.732
But she was difficult.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.333
Totally resisted counseling.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.069
Hmm. Sounds like you.

23:24.069 --> 23:28.207
She was my first
real success story.

23:36.715 --> 23:40.019
So this girl, Kelsey Yang-- what
else did Alana say about her?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.755
Just that they were both
tight, both oxy addicts.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.790
(dog barking nearby)

23:44.790 --> 23:47.726
Alana talked a lot in group
about getting Kelsey into rehab.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.298
(doorbell rings)

23:59.605 --> 24:01.340
Guess Kelsey’s not home?

24:07.346 --> 24:10.883
Kelsey Yang, Five-O!

24:10.883 --> 24:13.252
Stay here.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.899
Hey, you have to wait outside.
I said to wait outside.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.434
Why? Why?
Well, let’s just... Come on.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.968
Get out of my way, Tani.
No, I told you...

24:29.968 --> 24:31.737
Koa. Koa, no!
Get out of my way, Tani!

25:12.911 --> 25:14.680
TANI:
Koa, listen, this
is not your fault.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.848
You know that, right?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.282
You did everything
that you could.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.153
Hey.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.855
(garbled radio transmission)

25:22.855 --> 25:25.023
HPD found no sign
of foul play.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.193
Uh, they think it’s a bad batch
of black tar heroin.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.095
No, that’s not
what happened here.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.898
Alana was an oxy addict. Pills.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.867
She was afraid
of needles.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.736
I’m not buying it.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.405
No, I’m not
buying it.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.686
Tani.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.059
How did you...?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.162
One of the same places
I kept mine.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.663
All right, tell me
something. Why would she

26:04.663 --> 26:07.366
turn to heroin if there was
a stash of oxy in the house?

26:07.366 --> 26:09.935
Because Alana did not put
that needle in her arm, Tani.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.104
Someone did this to her.
Someone killed her.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.739
Guys, check this out.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.841
All of these were prescribed
by the same doctor,

26:15.841 --> 26:18.177
but every bottle has a
different patient name on it.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.712
That’s because this guy’s not
a doctor. He’s a dealer.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.381
Now, I’ve-I’ve heard of this.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.616
These doctors run pill mills,

26:24.616 --> 26:27.486
so they sell opioid
prescriptions for cash.

26:27.486 --> 26:28.921
Exactly.
Bring them a few fake I.D.’s,

26:28.921 --> 26:30.155
they’ll write scrips
for each one.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.524
If Alana and Kelsey
would use together,

26:32.524 --> 26:35.360
maybe that means they got
their meds at the same place.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.197
Right? And if Alana was trying
to get Kelsey into rehab,

26:38.197 --> 26:40.732
maybe plan B was
cutting off Kelsey’s supply.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.835
That’s totally something
she would have done.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.837
Alana had every reason
to want to turn this doctor in.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.371
And when she set her mind
on something,

26:46.371 --> 26:47.873
there was no stopping her.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.943
So doctor gets wind of the fact
that Alana might be a threat,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.945
takes her out before
she can shut him down.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.215
Yeah. Maybe she couldn’t,
but we can.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.218
JUNIOR:
Okay, so I asked

26:59.218 --> 27:00.552
around the late-night
food joints

27:00.552 --> 27:02.054
close to where
the party went down,

27:02.054 --> 27:03.956
and an employee at Zippy’s
remembers seeing two girls

27:03.956 --> 27:06.625
matching the description
of Grace and Katie an hour

27:06.625 --> 27:07.659
before the crash.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.094
They sent us over
video footage.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.195
Check it out.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.632
STEVE:
That’s them. There they are.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.569
Who in the hell is this bird?

27:22.140 --> 27:25.010
I don’t know,
but whoever this creep is,

27:25.010 --> 27:26.945
they’re not interested.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.149
Attagirl.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.856
GROVER: Now this creeper’s
following them.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.391
Hey, we got
cameras outside?

27:39.391 --> 27:40.893
Yeah.

27:47.199 --> 27:50.536
JUNIOR:
That’s our classic car.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.037
There’s our specialized
high-zinc oil.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.105
This is 20 minutes

27:53.105 --> 27:55.407
before the crash.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.842
Run this guy’s plate.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.777
Find him.

28:06.151 --> 28:09.187
Can I help you?

28:09.187 --> 28:11.590
Yeah, man. You’re really
selling this beauty?

28:11.590 --> 28:14.126
Yeah. It’s a great car,
an old classic.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.727
Yeah, looking for something
a little younger, huh?

28:15.727 --> 28:17.863
STEVE:
I’m interested.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.698
Why don’t you take me
for a test drive?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.632
All right.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.877
(engine revs)

28:33.145 --> 28:36.048
Hey, better hang
onto something.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.316
(engine revving)

28:37.316 --> 28:39.084
(tires squealing)

28:39.084 --> 28:40.752
(engine revving loudly)

28:40.752 --> 28:42.554
(tires squealing)

28:42.554 --> 28:44.489
(engine revving)

28:47.025 --> 28:48.460
Whoa. Easy, man.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.828
Oh, come on, man.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.497
I got to open this thing up
a little bit. Look at it.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.967
(engine revving)

28:54.967 --> 28:56.902
You know you got a
little oil leak, right?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.070
Yeah, it’s no big deal.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.538
I can get that fixed
for you in five minutes.

28:59.538 --> 29:02.241
Yeah, you probably should have
fixed it a few days ago,

29:02.241 --> 29:04.109
’cause last night,
we found a...

29:04.109 --> 29:06.845
found a whole bunch of
easily traceable specialty oil

29:06.845 --> 29:08.914
at a crime scene.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.016
(engine revving)

29:11.016 --> 29:13.819
See, that’s how we
found you, Keith.

29:13.819 --> 29:16.521
Plus, we got you on camera
harassing two underage girls

29:16.521 --> 29:17.856
at Zippy’s last night.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.392
Two girls
who ended up in a ditch

29:20.392 --> 29:22.728
by the side of a road
20 minutes later.

29:22.728 --> 29:26.264
And I have evidence
that a car just like this one

29:26.264 --> 29:28.033
was at the scene of the crime.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.501
What, are you a cop?
Yeah.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.536
I’m a cop, but worse
for you, I’m an uncle

29:31.536 --> 29:34.039
of one of those girls
you put in the ICU.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.141
(engine revving)

29:36.141 --> 29:37.776
We talked at Zippy’s.
That’s it.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.945
Yeah, you talked, but you were
pissed ’cause they didn’t want

29:39.945 --> 29:42.114
to talk to you. That upset you,
so you followed them.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.281
You followed them,
and then you...

29:43.281 --> 29:44.449
then you run them
off the road.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.751
Then you fled the
scene of the crime

29:45.751 --> 29:47.552
and left them
in a ditch to die, right?

29:47.552 --> 29:50.622
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

29:50.622 --> 29:52.024
Dude, slow down.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.358
What do you want me to
slow...? Oh, you’re not

29:53.358 --> 29:54.760
wearing a seat belt?
Oh, that’s bad.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.361
(tires squealing)

29:56.361 --> 29:57.629
(Keith groans)

29:57.629 --> 29:58.897
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

29:58.897 --> 30:00.132
This is insane.
You can’t do this.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.267
You can’t prove anything.
Oh, you’re right, Keith.

30:02.267 --> 30:05.404
I can’t prove anything, but what
I can do is slam the brakes now

30:05.404 --> 30:08.040
very hard and very fast,
and at this speed,

30:08.040 --> 30:11.076
without a seat belt, at the
very least, your head’s gonna

30:11.076 --> 30:12.277
bust open on that dashboard,

30:12.277 --> 30:13.745
or maybe, if
we’re lucky,

30:13.745 --> 30:15.914
you’ll go right through
that windshield.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.983
Please. I was just
trying to scare them.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.951
They sped up, and-and I sped up.
I didn’t realize

30:19.951 --> 30:21.386
how fast we were going,
and then they just...

30:21.386 --> 30:22.454
I thought they were dead.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.222
Yeah, but they weren’t dead,
Keith.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.657
They weren’t dead.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.793
(tires squealing)

30:27.793 --> 30:29.161
They were bleeding
in a ditch

30:29.161 --> 30:30.629
for over an hour before
anybody found them.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.764
Please! I’m so sorry. I’m sorry.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.267
Please!

30:35.267 --> 30:36.468
(engine revving)

30:38.136 --> 30:40.072
(garbled radio transmission)

30:41.840 --> 30:43.175
(car door closes)

30:43.175 --> 30:45.844
He’ll get negligent injury
in the first degree.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.779
Reckless driving.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.982
It’s jail time, Steve.

30:50.982 --> 30:53.485
Yeah, but if Grace
doesn’t pull through,

30:53.485 --> 30:55.420
it doesn’t make
a difference.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.560
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Florence, dial 112, please.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.629
Dr. Florence, please dial 112.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.366
(footsteps approaching)

31:09.568 --> 31:11.503
Hi.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.743
(sighs)

31:17.743 --> 31:21.179
I’m sorry about before.

31:21.179 --> 31:23.715
For what?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.184
For overreacting
before about the car.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.186
It was mean.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.122
I apologize. Um...

31:31.423 --> 31:34.793
No. I mean, I should have
said something.

31:34.793 --> 31:38.530
I should have been
more honest with you.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.066
About a lot of things.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.068
And then, you know,

31:43.068 --> 31:46.838
maybe we wouldn’t be here.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.374
What do you mean?

31:51.610 --> 31:55.180
Even back in Jersey, I knew that
I wasn’t happy with Stan,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.983
just not like I thought
I would be.

31:57.983 --> 32:00.819
But I didn’t want to put Grace
through another divorce,

32:00.819 --> 32:05.390
so we moved to Hawaii, and...

32:05.390 --> 32:07.893
now here we are.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.861
Okay, Rachel, don’t do that.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.863
Don’t do that. All right?

32:11.863 --> 32:15.133
All right, this is...

32:15.133 --> 32:18.003
this is like an asteroid
hitting Earth.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.905
Okay, it doesn’t matter
if we’re in Hawaii

32:19.905 --> 32:21.406
or in New Jersey.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.242
We just happened to be
underneath it when it hit, okay?

32:24.242 --> 32:25.644
That’s all.
Don’t do that.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.479
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

32:30.015 --> 32:31.783
What were you watching?

32:38.723 --> 32:40.192
(chuckles)

32:40.192 --> 32:43.628
It’s supposed to be a surprise
for Grace’s graduation.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.232
Come here.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.078
DANNY (in video): Rachel...
what do you got to say?

33:00.078 --> 33:01.313
(Rachel laughing)

33:01.313 --> 33:04.616
Well, I think
that she should say hi.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.751
Say hi to your daddy, Grace.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.119
DANNY (in video):
Hey, baby girl.

33:08.119 --> 33:11.523
DANNY (in video):
Wow. She’s so cute.
(laughs)

33:11.523 --> 33:13.491
She’s gorgeous.
Just like her mama, huh?

33:13.491 --> 33:14.793
Oh, come on, Danny.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.871
Those little teeth, man.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.702
(horns honk)

33:59.771 --> 34:02.274
Amy Holms?
Hi.

34:08.613 --> 34:10.048
She’s in.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.650
As soon as she trades
the cash for a scrip...

34:11.650 --> 34:13.551
ADAM (over comm):
...we go.
Copy.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.657
What can I do for you?

34:18.657 --> 34:21.459
Uh, well, I have...
I have this back problem.

34:21.459 --> 34:23.395
It’s pretty bad.
I-I get this

34:23.395 --> 34:26.131
excruciating pain that runs
up and down my legs.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.767
Um, I have, uh,
limited mobility.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.536
And you have
documentation of this?

34:32.637 --> 34:34.706
Uh, documenta...

34:34.706 --> 34:36.074
’Cause I thought, um...

34:37.576 --> 34:40.779
Look, I...
I have the cash.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.647
Please.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.086
(sighs)
Oxys or Roxis?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.788
TANI (over comm):
Can I have 60 oxy 80s?

34:51.189 --> 34:53.024
Thank you. Thank you.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.827
Whoa. Not so fast.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.529
GUARD (over comm):
One of the patients in the lobby

34:57.529 --> 34:58.663
recognized her; she’s a cop.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.265
Sit.

35:01.566 --> 35:02.634
We’ve got a problem.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.806
Dude, I’m not a cop.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.908
Y-You can take the scrip
back, and I’ll leave.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.242
I’m telling you,
I’m not a cop.

35:11.242 --> 35:13.244
If she’s a cop, that
means she’ll testify.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.713
We can’t let her go.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.081
(banging)
ADAM:
Five-O! Nobody move!

35:18.383 --> 35:20.652
Hands! Hands! Hands!

35:22.153 --> 35:23.421
You okay?

35:23.421 --> 35:26.725
Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.062
TANI:
That is a tight
little operation

35:31.062 --> 35:32.263
you’re running there, Doc.

35:32.263 --> 35:34.032
ADAM: Cash for scrips,
forged medical records.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.101
A pharmacy on the payroll.

35:36.101 --> 35:39.070
It’s incredible. I mean, you
will lose your medical license,

35:39.070 --> 35:41.373
and you’ll have federal
drug charges, and...

35:41.373 --> 35:42.507
Actually,
it’s your lucky day,

35:42.507 --> 35:43.942
because all we
care about right now

35:43.942 --> 35:45.810
is the murder of two
of your patients:

35:45.810 --> 35:48.813
Alana Kalani
and Kelsey Yang.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.149
So, you think you can
help us out with that, Doc?

35:51.149 --> 35:54.586
Not really, since this is
the first I’m hearing of it.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.854
TANI:
That’s so unfortunate,

35:55.854 --> 35:57.889
because we actually...
we pulled your phone records.

35:57.889 --> 35:58.957
Yeah.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.126
And it turns out
that Kelsey called you

36:01.126 --> 36:04.062
an hour before she and Alana
overdosed on heroin.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.031
ADAM:
She wasn’t calling
for drugs.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.333
Her house was full of them.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.068
Yeah, what was she
calling for, Doc?

36:10.068 --> 36:13.071
Something that made you
upset enough to kill her?

36:15.173 --> 36:18.309
Okay, we know you were
in business with someone.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.479
The same entity who pays
the rent on the clinic

36:21.479 --> 36:23.014
pays your employees.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.683
TANI: All of whom we’re
actually holding right now.

36:25.683 --> 36:28.353
And they are ready to roll,
let me tell you.

36:28.353 --> 36:31.790
So, if I were you,
I’d want to beat them to it.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.595
The clinic was set up by
the same cartel out of Morelos

36:37.595 --> 36:39.597
that moved the majority
of the black tar heroin

36:39.597 --> 36:41.466
in Hawaii.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.301
Oxy’s just another drug to them.

36:43.301 --> 36:46.304
And I’m just the medical license
they need to write scrips.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.740
Kelsey called me in a panic.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.608
Said that Alana’s out of rehab,

36:50.608 --> 36:52.177
and she was thinking about
going to the cops

36:52.177 --> 36:54.012
to shut down the clinic
that put her in there.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.980
Kelsey was afraid of
losing her supply.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.315
So you called your handlers,

36:57.315 --> 37:00.318
who you knew would
kill them both.

37:00.318 --> 37:03.254
Look, I’m a victim here, too.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.590
You think I want
to be doing this?

37:05.590 --> 37:07.926
They said they’d
kill me if I didn’t.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.862
Except there’s a reason they
approached you, isn’t there?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.530
ADAM: Might have something
to do with the fact

37:12.530 --> 37:13.998
that when you were a GP,

37:13.998 --> 37:16.067
your little family practice
was prescribing oxy

37:16.067 --> 37:17.168
to every other patient.

37:17.168 --> 37:20.672
You’ve been doing this
for years, Doc.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.307
What’s a couple more overdoses

37:22.307 --> 37:24.776
if it means protecting
your revenue stream?

37:35.120 --> 37:36.855
(exhales)

37:40.759 --> 37:43.161
Found the guy?

37:43.161 --> 37:46.564
Yeah, we found the guy.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.766
Thanks.

37:50.668 --> 37:54.105
I got to say, man,
this kid’s really

37:54.105 --> 37:56.141
starting to take
after her old man.

37:56.141 --> 37:58.610
I mean, standing up
to the bully,

37:58.610 --> 38:00.111
speaking up for
the little guy.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.581
Yeah, I think maybe she, uh...

38:03.581 --> 38:05.817
she gets that from you
more than me.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.519
What are you talking about?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.320
I don’t know, uh,

38:09.320 --> 38:11.556
Rachel made a graduation
video for Grace,

38:11.556 --> 38:13.591
and I think you’re in
more shots than I am.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.460
Really?
Yeah. Don’t get excited
about it.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.429
No, I’m not getting excited.
I would like to see it.
Well, that’s enough.

38:18.429 --> 38:20.398
Oh, hey, you know what?
What?

38:20.398 --> 38:23.134
We should have a graduation
party for Grace at my house.
Yeah.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.003
Listen, in the backyard,
we’ll get a big screen

38:25.003 --> 38:26.671
and a projector for the video.
Shut up.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.973
Invite the neighborhood.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.612
She’s out. She’s okay.

38:38.516 --> 38:41.352
She’s okay.
(chuckles)

38:45.056 --> 38:46.891
Ooh.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.528
(exhales, chuckles)

39:26.364 --> 39:27.632
RACHEL:
Careful, now, honey.

39:27.632 --> 39:30.201
Watch your step.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.136
(loud cheers and applause)

39:34.739 --> 39:35.807
Dad, did you know?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.308
No, I didn’t know anything.

39:37.308 --> 39:40.712
Uh, Charlie put up the banner.
I was just the ladder.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.847
I painted it, too.
Yeah, Charlie!

39:42.847 --> 39:44.849
GROVER: Oh, by the way,
I have a message

39:44.849 --> 39:46.184
for you from, uh,

39:46.184 --> 39:47.485
a Will?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.487
He says he’ll be here tomorrow.
He can’t wait to see you.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.656
Okay, give me a hug. All right.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.492
Welcome home, honey.
Come here.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.829
Hey, listen, um, now that
he’s out of the room,

39:57.829 --> 39:59.130
I’m just gonna tell you,

39:59.130 --> 40:01.566
you thought your father
was neurotic before, oof,

40:01.566 --> 40:02.967
girl, you done
did it now.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.035
(chuckles)

40:04.035 --> 40:06.237
Dad told me what
you guys did for me.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.238
Oh, yeah?
What?

40:07.238 --> 40:09.540
How you found the guy who...

40:09.540 --> 40:11.042
I just want to say thank you.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.144
Well, you’re welcome.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.980
Listen, just ’cause you’re all
growing up and out to college,

40:15.980 --> 40:17.882
and, you know,
being independent,

40:17.882 --> 40:20.385
we’re still here, okay? Any time
you need us, we got you.

40:20.385 --> 40:21.986
And just like you did
for your friend,

40:21.986 --> 40:23.588
that’s why your parents
are proud of you.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.890
And we all are.
We’re all proud.
We’re all proud of you.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.692
That’s enough. You want
to make her cry? That’s enough.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.160
Come on.
You sure you not
talking about you?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.461
You’re getting a
little glisten...
Can we eat?

40:30.461 --> 40:31.663
Let’s eat, please.
...in the eye area.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.933
Perfect timing.
The ziti’s ready.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.335
The ziti?
It doesn’t...
Him saying "ziti,"

40:37.335 --> 40:38.436
it just doesn’t
sit right.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.571
KAMEKONA:
Kamekona’s ’ohana style

40:40.571 --> 40:42.073
Italian restaurant
at your service.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.308
STEVE: I still prefer
the name "Steve’s."

40:43.308 --> 40:44.909
DANNY:
I don’t.

40:44.909 --> 40:47.078
(overlapping chatter)

40:47.078 --> 40:48.646
Don’t get up.
Don’t get up.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.315
Don’t get up.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.918
Hey, I hear HPD

40:53.918 --> 40:55.653
raided two more
pill mills that were

40:55.653 --> 40:57.088
connected to
the same cartel.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.823
I just want to say
that’s great work.

40:58.823 --> 41:01.259
Thank you. You know, I couldn’t
have done it without Koa.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.827
Yeah.
KOA: Yeah, she
could have.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.662
She’s just making me
feel included.

41:04.662 --> 41:06.164
Is it working?
I told you,

41:06.164 --> 41:07.832
you don’t need to worry
about me anymore.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.200
And yes, it’s working.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.804
I appreciate you, sis,
and I appreciate

41:12.804 --> 41:14.472
being a part
of this big,

41:14.472 --> 41:16.140
weird family
you brought into my life.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.375
We’re happy to have you,
brother.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.376
All right.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.645
♪ With a smile on my face ♪

41:20.645 --> 41:23.014
♪ You’re the first thing
that I see... ♪

41:23.014 --> 41:24.582
You hungry?

41:24.582 --> 41:27.452
Oh, thank you.
Yes, I’m starving.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.287
This is our, uh...
our best flatware.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.823
(laughs) Thank you.
Can I sit?

41:31.823 --> 41:34.625
Yeah. What is this,
osso buco?
It is.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.361
Ah.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.732
Good?

41:40.732 --> 41:42.967
Hmm?
I said, "Is it good?"

41:42.967 --> 41:43.968
Mm.

41:46.270 --> 41:49.307
Mmm.
That’s a yes.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.242
(laughter)

41:55.546 --> 41:57.782
I’m having the most bizarre
déjà vu.

41:57.782 --> 42:00.251
Really? From, uh... from what?

42:00.251 --> 42:02.553
Our first date.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.889
I think that you
made this for me.

42:04.889 --> 42:06.891
Why do you think
it’s on the menu?

42:06.891 --> 42:08.760
(laughing):
Oh, come on.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.429
Yeah.
