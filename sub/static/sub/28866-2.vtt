01:01.734 --> 01:03.432
It's my friend.
He's injured.

01:03.434 --> 01:04.834
He needs an ambulance.

01:06.868 --> 01:08.632
715 to control.

01:08.634 --> 01:09.632
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:09.634 --> 01:11.699
He can't be dead.

01:11.701 --> 01:13.665
What am I gonna tell Helen?

01:13.667 --> 01:15.799
This was his stag night.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.465
This is nice and early.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.501
Hope we didn't disturb
your beauty sleep, Sarge.

01:51.701 --> 01:53.732
So are we sure
this is really for us?

01:53.734 --> 01:57.131
Sure he didn't just fall over
and bang his head, drunk?

01:57.133 --> 01:58.834
Think you'd better take a look.

02:04.434 --> 02:06.701
Yeah, he didn't get that
falling over.

02:08.366 --> 02:11.165
Struck across the temple
repeatedly, I'd say.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.198
At first we thought maybe
it was a robbery gone wrong,

02:13.200 --> 02:15.065
but he's still got his wallet
and his phone.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.365
So who is he?

02:16.367 --> 02:19.465
Mitchell MacDonald.
Last night was his stag do.

02:19.467 --> 02:23.467
Well, I hope he hasn't paid
for the wedding reception.

02:24.501 --> 02:26.465
- Witnesses?
- One.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.065
Mr. Jacob Holt.

02:28.067 --> 02:29.398
He tried to revive the victim,

02:29.400 --> 02:32.167
but, well, looks like
he was too late.

02:34.934 --> 02:37.265
This is Jacob Holt.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.599
Ah, I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

02:39.601 --> 02:41.599
Are you a friend
of the deceased?

02:41.601 --> 02:43.632
Not exactly.

02:43.634 --> 02:45.501
He was engaged to my ex-wife.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.532
And you were on the stag night?

02:48.534 --> 02:51.198
I had to look after my son,
Will.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.398
He's the best man.
He's only 18.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.866
And where was Will when you
found Mitchell in the alleyway?

02:55.868 --> 02:58.899
- He'd gone home already.
- Where's home?

02:58.901 --> 03:01.365
Lives with my ex-wife, Helen.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.532
Mr. Holt's given me
the address.

03:03.534 --> 03:04.998
Look, I've been thinking...

03:05.000 --> 03:07.065
I'm sure there were two men
at the end of the alley

03:07.067 --> 03:08.332
when I came out of the bar.

03:08.334 --> 03:09.365
Can you describe them?

03:09.367 --> 03:12.532
Young, tall.

03:12.534 --> 03:13.998
Wearing hoodies.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.265
Okay, uh, well,
if you can come with me,

03:16.267 --> 03:17.534
we need your clothes
for evidence.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.031
You come across a Detective
Inspector David Bradford?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.632
He's my boss.

03:33.634 --> 03:36.465
Does that mean he'll be
in charge of the investigation?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.665
He will be, yeah.
Why? Do you know him?

03:38.667 --> 03:40.599
Only through his wife.

03:40.601 --> 03:42.866
I'm a social worker like Sarah.

03:42.868 --> 03:45.565
Have they worked out
what happened to her yet?

03:45.567 --> 03:47.667
No, the inquiry
is still ongoing.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.098
- Helen Holt?
- Yes?

04:12.100 --> 04:14.198
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole,

04:14.200 --> 04:17.265
and this is Trainee Detective
Constable Billie Fitzgerald.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.466
Can we come in?

04:27.634 --> 04:30.968
Gemma, do you want to pop
outside and play for a bit?

04:38.834 --> 04:41.432
What's happened?

04:41.434 --> 04:43.098
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

04:43.100 --> 04:44.832
but your fiancÃ©,
Mitchell MacDonald,

04:44.834 --> 04:48.065
was attacked outside a bar
in Soho early this morning.

04:48.067 --> 04:50.200
What do you mean, attacked?
Who... Who attacked him?

04:51.801 --> 04:55.100
Mrs. Holt, Mitchell is dead.

04:58.734 --> 05:01.332
He can't be dead.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.098
We're getting married.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.432
A few of us went for a pizza
in Berwick Street

05:05.434 --> 05:06.765
and then on to the bar.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.565
Did all of you go to the bar?

05:08.567 --> 05:11.033
No, just me, Mitchell, and Will.

05:12.701 --> 05:16.899
So why did Mitchell ask Will
to be his best man?

05:16.901 --> 05:19.265
He moved down from Scotland
a few months ago,

05:19.267 --> 05:23.165
and I suppose he didn't have
many friends in London.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.732
Helen, my ex-wife,

05:24.734 --> 05:28.966
Will being best man
was her brilliant idea.

05:28.968 --> 05:30.398
And you didn't approve of that?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.932
It's too much
for an 18-year-old.

05:32.934 --> 05:34.298
Helen can't see that.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.465
She's too busy being in love.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.998
I fell for Mitchell
the first time I met him.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.799
Love at first sight.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.334
Mm.

05:46.200 --> 05:50.699
I went to see my ex-husband,
Jacob, at his office.

05:50.701 --> 05:54.031
He was running late as usual,
so I got chatting to Mitchell.

05:54.033 --> 05:56.565
He was on the front desk.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.432
He was so sweet.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.899
Sympathetic.

06:00.901 --> 06:02.467
A real listener.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.899
He'd just been through a really
bad breakup and so had I,

06:06.901 --> 06:08.031
so before we knew it

06:08.033 --> 06:10.367
we were telling each other
our life stories.

06:12.901 --> 06:17.665
Two weeks later, he moved in
with her... and my kids.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.565
And you weren't over the moon
about that either?

06:19.567 --> 06:21.799
Just seemed too fast.

06:21.801 --> 06:24.098
Helen hadn't even got over
the last one moving out.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.131
The last one?

06:26.133 --> 06:29.665
The yoga teacher.
Brandon.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.732
This is Brandon's baby.

06:32.734 --> 06:34.765
Not that he cares.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.934
He's in San Francisco
with some bimbo.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.067
Mitchell said...

06:43.400 --> 06:45.868
..."Your baby
needs a father...

06:47.634 --> 06:49.367
...and I need you.

06:50.734 --> 06:53.300
That's why I'm asking you
to marry me."

06:55.000 --> 06:56.332
Isn't that romantic?

06:56.334 --> 06:57.899
It's lovely.

06:57.901 --> 06:59.899
Mrs. Holt,
can you think of anyone

06:59.901 --> 07:01.934
who might
want to harm Mitchell?

07:02.868 --> 07:04.799
Absolutely not.

07:04.801 --> 07:08.298
He's the gentlest,
most caring man I ever met.

07:08.300 --> 07:12.098
Mitchell wasn't the saint
Helen thinks he was.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.799
Go on.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.432
Turns out, after a few drinks,

07:16.434 --> 07:18.532
mild-mannered Mitchell
got aggressive.

07:18.534 --> 07:20.565
He nearly started a fight
with two men

07:20.567 --> 07:22.298
while we were queuing
to get in the bar.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.632
What about?

07:23.634 --> 07:24.699
I don't know.

07:24.701 --> 07:26.866
I was on the phone
to my girlfriend.

07:26.868 --> 07:30.732
So is it possible that the men
that were in the queue

07:30.734 --> 07:32.734
are the same men you saw
near the murder scene?

07:35.434 --> 07:38.565
It's possible,
but I can't be sure.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.167
I didn't get
a good look at them.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.300
But Will might have done?

07:47.501 --> 07:49.634
Mrs. Holt,
can we speak to your son?

07:51.100 --> 07:52.732
Will?
He's not here.

07:52.734 --> 07:53.932
Sorry?

07:53.934 --> 07:56.400
Well, I assumed
they'd all crashed at his dad's.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.367
Just let me know
if he turns up.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.998
That was my girlfriend.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.665
Will's not at my place.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.400
Where is he?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.801
Great. Cheers.
Thank you.

08:23.567 --> 08:24.998
Right.
Where are we at?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.098
Will Holt didn't go home
last night,

08:27.100 --> 08:30.165
he didn't go to his dad's flat,
and his phone is switched off.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.832
According to his dad, he's been
going off the rails recently.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.198
Flunked his exams,
walked out of school.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.164
He's even been in trouble
with the local police.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.599
What for?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.133
Uh, caution for shoplifting.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.432
So he's missing.

08:44.434 --> 08:46.732
Probably just sleeping off
a hangover at a mate's.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.031
I know what I was like
when I was 18.

08:48.033 --> 08:51.232
His future stepfather was
the victim of a targeted attack.

08:51.234 --> 08:54.000
That makes this boy a high-risk
missing person in my book.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.899
Rob, put a trace on his phone
and circulate his details.

09:00.901 --> 09:03.298
I want a full briefing
in 10 minutes.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.765
- Boss.
- Viv.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.934
It's Vivienne.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.398
Is he all right?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.665
Apart from the fact
that his wife's been missing

09:13.667 --> 09:14.998
for three months?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.232
Yeah, I'm sure
he's on top of the world.

09:17.234 --> 09:19.832
Vivienne reckons he's refusing
to face up to the fact

09:19.834 --> 09:21.298
that his wife is dead.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.534
Oh, does she now?

09:28.801 --> 09:30.098
I'm so sorry.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.699
It took me ages to find someone
to sit with Gemma.

09:32.701 --> 09:35.998
I hear you're friends
with this Jacob Holt.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.465
- Anything I should know?
- Barely know the man.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.932
He worked with my wife
a few years back.

09:40.934 --> 09:43.298
We socialized once or twice.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.267
Okay. Got it.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.398
Thanks for coming in.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.834
David, nice to see you.

09:54.601 --> 09:55.767
Sorry to hear about Sarah.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.432
Hello, Mrs. Holt.

09:59.434 --> 10:01.599
I'm Detective Inspector
David Bradford.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.734
You've found Will?

10:03.767 --> 10:06.031
We have officers looking for him
as we speak.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.232
Meanwhile, Detective
Sergeant Cole and her team

10:08.234 --> 10:11.098
are fully focused
on finding your fiancÃ©'s killer

10:11.100 --> 10:12.699
and bringing them to justice.

10:12.701 --> 10:14.834
Thanks, David.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.565
Very sorry for your loss.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.834
The sergeant will answer
any questions you might have.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.198
If you people
can't find his wife,

10:26.200 --> 10:28.033
how the hell
are you gonna find my son?

10:29.434 --> 10:32.098
Mitchell MacDonald.
41 years old.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.499
Moved to London from Edinburgh
six months ago.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.031
He's been doing temporary
office work ever since.

10:37.033 --> 10:40.801
His fiancÃ© says he moved down
here when his marriage broke up.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.765
Now, Mitchell was attacked
around 3:00 a.m. this morning.

10:44.767 --> 10:47.599
Now, the pathologist reckons
he was punched in the face first

10:47.601 --> 10:50.532
and then beaten repeatedly over
the head with a hard object,

10:50.534 --> 10:52.198
almost certainly a bottle.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.765
There was a whole bin
full of bottles.

10:54.767 --> 10:56.532
We've had to confiscate
the whole thing.

10:56.534 --> 10:59.265
What about victimology?
Who was this guy?

10:59.267 --> 11:01.998
No criminal record.
Nothing on the PNC.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.998
He's got an ex-wife
and daughter in Edinburgh,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.398
but I spoke to Police Scotland,

11:05.400 --> 11:08.232
and the wife isn't answering
her phone or the front door.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.499
One thing sticks out.

11:09.501 --> 11:12.232
I checked out Mitchell MacDonald
on Open Source.

11:12.234 --> 11:15.932
Up in Scotland he was deputy
head teacher of a posh academy.

11:15.934 --> 11:18.067
So why was he working
as an office temp down here?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.832
Mitchell was the office manager

11:24.834 --> 11:26.765
in an insurance broker's
in Edinburgh.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.532
He had to start again
in London.

11:28.534 --> 11:30.734
That's why
he was doing temp work.

11:32.334 --> 11:35.868
Mitchell MacDonald
was a deputy head teacher.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.131
Sorry, I-I think you've got
your facts mixed up.

11:41.133 --> 11:45.131
Mitchell was deputy head of
Moraybank Academy in Edinburgh

11:45.133 --> 11:47.367
until he resigned
at the end of last year.

11:52.934 --> 11:55.167
Why didn't he tell me
the truth?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.131
You okay, boss?

12:00.133 --> 12:02.133
Sure.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.565
Any news from
the missing persons team yet?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.232
They've absolutely no idea

12:15.234 --> 12:18.866
why Sarah's handbag
was left at that party.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.398
She's 20 years older
than those kids.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.467
What would she be doing there?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.098
Have you found Will Holt yet?

12:27.100 --> 12:29.866
Not yet, no,
but there's some CCTV footage

12:29.868 --> 12:31.298
that I think
you should take a look at.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.434
Right.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.165
So this is the queue
outside the bar.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.365
Two men in hoodies.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.198
Just like Jacob described.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.232
Big guy on the left

12:46.234 --> 12:48.966
has got a gym logo
on the back of his hoodie.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.932
With muscles like that,

12:50.934 --> 12:53.133
I reckon he's a regular.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.932
Okay.
Thanks for that.

13:01.968 --> 13:05.098
Will Holt called
a Tamsin MacDonald

13:05.100 --> 13:06.532
three times yesterday.

13:06.534 --> 13:09.599
She's the victim's daughter,
and she's studying in London.

13:09.601 --> 13:11.732
Has anyone told her
that her dad's dead yet?

13:11.734 --> 13:12.765
No.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.832
She's got a part-time job
at a hotel cafÃ©.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.834
I'll head over there now.

13:23.701 --> 13:25.632
And how did you get on
with Mister Muscles?

13:25.634 --> 13:28.131
Danny Williams
and his boyfriend intervened

13:28.133 --> 13:30.432
because Mitchell was giving Will
a hard time.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.465
They only stayed for one drink,

13:32.467 --> 13:34.198
and then they went on to a club,

13:34.200 --> 13:36.098
and that's where they were
at the time of the murder.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.232
So they can't be the two men
that Jacob Holt saw

13:38.234 --> 13:40.265
when he found the victim
in the alleyway?

13:40.267 --> 13:41.732
No.

13:41.734 --> 13:43.899
You know, it's a really
big coincidence.

13:43.901 --> 13:45.732
What is?

13:45.734 --> 13:49.632
Well, that Jacob Holt
saw two men in the alley

13:49.634 --> 13:51.632
that match the description
of the guys in the queue.

13:51.634 --> 13:54.298
But he did say he wasn't sure,
though, to be fair.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.732
And now we're looking, what,
for two different men,

13:56.734 --> 13:58.799
also tall,
also wearing hoodies?

13:58.801 --> 14:00.298
What's your point?

14:00.300 --> 14:03.765
Well, how reliable a witness
is Jacob Holt?

14:03.767 --> 14:05.398
He's a social worker.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.932
Like Sarah was.

14:06.934 --> 14:09.467
Like Sarah is.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.866
Tamsin MacDonald?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.165
Yeah?

14:29.167 --> 14:32.599
I'm Trainee Detective Constable
Billie Fitzgerald.

14:32.601 --> 14:35.467
I'm so sorry to tell you this,
but I've got some bad news.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.534
I hear you think the detective
inspector's wife's dead.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.031
Well, don't <i>you?</i>

14:53.033 --> 14:54.899
Her car was found abandoned.

14:54.901 --> 14:56.732
She hasn't used her phone
or any of her cards.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.432
All right, so how do you
explain the fact

14:58.434 --> 14:59.966
that we found her handbag,
then?

14:59.968 --> 15:01.298
I can't.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.866
But you know as well as I do
that means nothing.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.298
The way Sarah was talking...

15:05.300 --> 15:07.968
What, you spoke to her
before she went missing?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.998
We went for a drink.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.665
Why?

15:13.667 --> 15:17.699
I don't really know.
Um, she asked me.

15:17.701 --> 15:19.599
She seemed really down.

15:19.601 --> 15:21.932
Have you told the missing
persons inquiry about this?

15:21.934 --> 15:23.065
Yeah.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.434
And the detective inspector?

15:30.801 --> 15:32.968
So somebody killed him?

15:34.834 --> 15:37.398
Why did your dad move out?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.866
That's private.
Family business.

15:39.868 --> 15:42.998
We're investigating his murder.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.834
Why did he lie
about being a teacher?

15:46.868 --> 15:48.131
I don't know.

15:48.133 --> 15:49.632
I didn't even know
my dad was in London

15:49.634 --> 15:51.432
till that lad
rang me yesterday.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.567
Will Holt?

15:53.868 --> 15:55.998
He invited me
to the stupid wedding.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.398
I told him I wasn't interested.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.065
We've been trying
to get hold of your mum.

16:01.067 --> 16:04.834
You can leave that to me.
I'll tell her what's happened.

16:19.868 --> 16:22.100
Mum, pick up.
It's me.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.067
Good news.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.601
He's dead.

16:35.734 --> 16:39.265
Sarah called me
and asked to meet.

16:39.267 --> 16:42.565
I mean, I didn't feel
that I could say no.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.634
No, I bet you didn't.

16:46.234 --> 16:49.200
So, what did my wife
want to talk about?

16:51.434 --> 16:54.000
She mentioned that your marriage
was in trouble.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.632
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

16:56.634 --> 16:58.432
Because I didn't feel
it could help.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.501
It's an indication
of her state of mind.

17:02.634 --> 17:05.934
And that's why I spoke
to the missing persons inquiry.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.565
Which explains why they asked me

17:10.567 --> 17:12.699
so many questions
about my marriage.

17:12.701 --> 17:14.464
My sex life.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.765
It's all down to you.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.598
- I'm not apologizing.
- No.

17:18.601 --> 17:21.099
Why change the habit
of a lifetime?

17:24.032 --> 17:26.267
So why come clean now?

17:27.634 --> 17:29.932
Because we're a team.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.298
And now you're back at work,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.198
I don't want to keep
any secrets from you.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.866
The thing is, Vivienne,
you're not a team player.

17:36.868 --> 17:38.467
Are you?

17:44.234 --> 17:46.232
This is Madison Street

17:46.234 --> 17:50.499
between the Strand
and the Embankment at 3:27 a.m.

17:50.501 --> 17:54.332
Now, here we can see Will Holt

17:54.334 --> 17:59.665
and what appears to be blood
on his hands and clothes.

17:59.667 --> 18:02.599
So Will could have attacked
Mitchell MacDonald?

18:02.601 --> 18:04.298
His father was lying.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.632
- Where are you going?
- Well, to challenge him.

18:06.634 --> 18:09.165
No, you're not.
I want that kid found.

18:09.167 --> 18:11.665
I'll speak to Jacob Holt.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.198
Old boys' network strikes again.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.298
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.334
Yeah, isn't it?

18:19.434 --> 18:21.998
When did Will leave the bar?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.432
I'm not sure exactly.

18:24.434 --> 18:27.065
About 15 minutes before
I found Mitchell in the alley.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.298
And which exit did he use?

18:29.300 --> 18:30.765
I don't know.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.632
Place was packed.

18:32.634 --> 18:34.765
Where do you think Will is now,
Jacob?

18:34.767 --> 18:37.065
What's all this about?

18:37.067 --> 18:39.131
If you've found something,
you've got to tell me.

18:39.133 --> 18:40.932
His mother's beside herself.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.632
We came across some CCTV
of Will,

18:43.634 --> 18:47.067
about half an hour after
you found Mitchell dead.

18:48.868 --> 18:51.966
He had blood
on his hands and clothing.

18:51.968 --> 18:56.133
You think that means
Will attacked Mitchell?

18:58.133 --> 18:59.899
Well, what would <i>you</i> think?

18:59.901 --> 19:01.332
In my place.

19:01.334 --> 19:04.599
Well, that there's a hundred
ways an 18-year-old boy

19:04.601 --> 19:08.565
can injure himself
or get injured in Central London

19:08.567 --> 19:10.033
on a Saturday night.

19:17.334 --> 19:18.200
You were right.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.801
Jacob is lying.

19:22.901 --> 19:24.934
To protect his son?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.434
Why else?

19:58.601 --> 20:01.801
This is just work. I'll, uh...
I'll take it outside.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.232
- Dad?
- Will, where have you been?

20:12.234 --> 20:13.398
How's Mitchell?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.767
He's dead.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.298
The tech team have just called.
Will Holt's turned his phone on.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.732
He's somewhere
on the South Bank,

20:22.734 --> 20:24.334
and he's just called his dad.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.966
Where's Jacob?

20:41.968 --> 20:43.300
He's taking a call.

20:46.467 --> 20:49.434
Jacob! Stop!

20:59.501 --> 21:02.532
I'm betting Jacob's on his way
to the South Bank.

21:02.534 --> 21:03.534
Right.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.265
Are you sure?

21:14.267 --> 21:15.866
Yeah, there was
blood everywhere.

21:15.868 --> 21:18.534
How can I face my mum?

21:28.200 --> 21:30.934
Will Holt, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

21:32.467 --> 21:33.966
I did it.

21:33.968 --> 21:35.966
I killed him.

21:35.968 --> 21:37.699
I killed him
'cause he was a pedophile.

21:37.701 --> 21:39.701
It's all right, son.
It's all right.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.031
Come on, then.

21:43.033 --> 21:44.998
Will Holt, I'm arresting you

21:45.000 --> 21:46.832
for the murder
of Mitchell MacDonald.

21:46.834 --> 21:49.998
You of all people should know
to leave it to the police.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.265
Will called me.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.365
My first instinct
was to go to him.

21:53.367 --> 21:56.167
Did you lie to us?
About when Will left the bar?

21:57.367 --> 22:00.832
I was trying to protect my son.
Surely you must understand that.

22:00.834 --> 22:03.165
It doesn't matter
what I do or don't understand.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.932
You've broken the law.

22:04.934 --> 22:07.765
- Can't you just...
- What, turn a blind eye? No.

22:07.767 --> 22:10.065
I turned a blind eye for you
when you were having it away

22:10.067 --> 22:11.300
with one of Sarah's colleagues.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.000
So, what are you gonna do?
Tell my wife?

22:16.601 --> 22:18.866
Jacob Holt, I'm arresting you

22:18.868 --> 22:21.434
on suspicion of perverting
the course of justice.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.365
So, what do you reckon?
To Mitchell being a pedophile.

22:31.367 --> 22:34.634
It's certainly
a motive for murder.

22:41.701 --> 22:44.098
It's Will's mother
I feel sorry for.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.966
She's got a 10-year-old daughter
and a baby on the way.

22:45.968 --> 22:48.265
MacDonald being a sex offender
would explain a lot.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.699
Yeah, like why he gave up
a deputy head teacher position

22:50.701 --> 22:51.866
to do temp work.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.232
And why his daughter
was so cagey with me.

22:54.234 --> 22:55.665
I really feel like
I failed with her.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.065
I'll go back
and talk to her again.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.398
No, you won't.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.432
Helen Holt's babysitter
needs to be somewhere else.

23:00.434 --> 23:02.734
I want you to drive Helen home.
Keep an eye on her.

23:03.734 --> 23:06.432
Rob, you have a crack
at MacDonald's daughter.

23:06.434 --> 23:08.801
We need to know
what happened in Scotland.

23:18.234 --> 23:20.998
Are you gonna let me
interview Will Holt?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.098
Why wouldn't I?

23:22.100 --> 23:24.365
Because you're angry with me.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.234
I'm angry with myself.

23:29.667 --> 23:33.400
Do you really not know why
my wife asked to talk to you?

23:36.901 --> 23:39.765
She wanted to suss me out.

23:39.767 --> 23:43.265
She wanted to know if you and I
were having an affair.

23:43.267 --> 23:46.400
Which tells you all you need
to know about my marriage.

23:48.300 --> 23:53.098
You know, finding Sarah's
handbag could be a hopeful sign.

23:53.100 --> 23:56.732
No, this job makes you cynical.

23:56.734 --> 23:59.899
It is perfectly possible
that Sarah was at that party,

23:59.901 --> 24:02.767
just like it's
perfectly possible she's alive.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.031
We'll interview Will together.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.067
You can lead.

24:19.534 --> 24:22.467
Mum was on at me
to pull my finger out.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.866
As best man,
I thought I'd surprise them

24:25.868 --> 24:27.966
by inviting Mitchell's daughter
to the wedding.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.232
How did you find her?

24:29.234 --> 24:30.966
I knew her name was Tamsin.

24:30.968 --> 24:33.499
I found her
on social media.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.699
When I told her
my mum was marrying her dad,

24:35.701 --> 24:37.832
she went crazy.

24:37.834 --> 24:39.699
What did she say?

24:39.701 --> 24:42.398
I had to stop the wedding.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.699
She reckoned that her dad
was only marrying my mum

24:45.701 --> 24:47.065
to get to my little sister.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.634
Why did she think that?

24:49.934 --> 24:52.165
Because he had done it before.

24:52.167 --> 24:55.100
Groomed some kid in Edinburgh
and then raped her.

24:59.601 --> 25:01.432
So then what happened?

25:01.434 --> 25:02.832
I went home,

25:02.834 --> 25:06.434
told Mitchell he had to
finish with my mum and get out.

25:07.567 --> 25:10.031
And what was Mitchell's
response to this?

25:10.033 --> 25:13.098
He told me Tamsin was lying.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.265
Did you believe him?

25:14.267 --> 25:16.000
Of course not.

25:17.601 --> 25:21.634
Will, why didn't you tell
your Mum what Tamsin had said?

25:22.834 --> 25:24.699
I couldn't.

25:24.701 --> 25:26.267
Why not?

25:27.501 --> 25:29.734
I ju... I just couldn't.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.665
Billie, it's me.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.065
Tamsin MacDonald's
done a disappearing act.

25:39.067 --> 25:40.799
Got any idea
where she might have gone?

25:40.801 --> 25:42.465
Not a clue.

25:42.467 --> 25:43.866
Sorry.

25:43.868 --> 25:45.167
All right, cheers.

25:53.501 --> 25:55.298
I got really drunk.

25:55.300 --> 25:58.165
When Mitchell went out
for a smoke, I followed him,

25:58.167 --> 26:01.165
told him there was no way
he was marrying my mum.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.432
He just laughed.

26:03.434 --> 26:05.198
So I punched him.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.232
So, what did he do
when you punched him?

26:07.234 --> 26:09.968
He fell backwards.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.067
And then?

26:13.334 --> 26:16.567
I picked up a bottle
and hit him over the head.

26:18.501 --> 26:20.234
How many times did you hit him?

26:23.267 --> 26:24.434
I don't know.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.067
You must know how many times
you hit him.

26:31.767 --> 26:34.599
I can't remember exactly.

26:34.601 --> 26:37.400
Like I said, I was drunk,
really drunk.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.298
Are you happy with that?

26:43.300 --> 26:46.799
No. Absolutely not.

26:46.801 --> 26:48.899
Take him back
to the scene of the crime.

26:48.901 --> 26:51.434
- Walk him through it.
- Yeah.

26:54.901 --> 26:56.765
Yeah, cheers, mate.

26:56.767 --> 26:58.998
Police Scotland are checking
if any complaints

26:59.000 --> 27:00.765
were ever made
against Mitchell MacDonald.

27:00.767 --> 27:03.332
So we've only got
Will Holt's word for it

27:03.334 --> 27:05.065
that Mitchell MacDonald
was a pedophile.

27:05.067 --> 27:06.767
At the moment.

27:08.734 --> 27:10.799
Get hold of his laptop.

27:10.801 --> 27:13.667
I reckon we should take a look
at his browsing history.

27:25.734 --> 27:28.601
Yeah, right. Okay.
Thanks, bye.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.165
Has something happened to Will?

27:34.167 --> 27:36.465
Will's been arrested,

27:36.467 --> 27:38.398
and I need to tell you
I have authority

27:38.400 --> 27:39.499
to search these premises.

27:39.501 --> 27:42.133
Why?

27:43.334 --> 27:46.232
Will's made certain allegations
against Mitchell MacDonald.

27:46.234 --> 27:48.100
Well, what's he said?

27:51.167 --> 27:53.265
Will claims that he spoke
to Mitchell's daughter

27:53.267 --> 27:55.434
and that she told him
that Mitchell was a pedophile.

27:56.501 --> 28:00.200
According to Will, Mitchell
raped a child in Scotland.

28:01.434 --> 28:04.365
That's why his marriage
fell apart.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.467
Why he left his job
and came down here.

28:48.567 --> 28:50.667
One of you take
the ground floor.

29:08.334 --> 29:10.131
Mitchell went out through there.

29:10.133 --> 29:12.998
Yeah, and where was your dad?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.565
I'm not sure.

29:14.567 --> 29:15.601
In the loo?

29:17.033 --> 29:18.167
Okay.

29:26.033 --> 29:30.198
Mitchell was standing over there
by some bins,

29:30.200 --> 29:31.998
having a cigarette.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.767
Go on.

29:35.167 --> 29:38.300
I went over, pushed him...

29:39.834 --> 29:41.634
And then?

29:43.367 --> 29:46.501
He turned 'round,
and I punched him in the face.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.832
Rob, Billie.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.868
There's something
you should see.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.734
It's a spy cam.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.601
In a 10-year-old girl's bedroom?

30:39.133 --> 30:40.998
How many times
did you hit Mitchell

30:41.000 --> 30:42.966
in the head with the bottle?

30:42.968 --> 30:45.365
I've... I've told you,
I don't know.

30:45.367 --> 30:48.699
Come on, indulge me.
Just pick a number. Just...

30:48.701 --> 30:51.732
Twice?
Five times?

30:51.734 --> 30:53.000
Six?

30:55.567 --> 30:57.868
You really don't know, do you?

31:01.634 --> 31:03.432
Look, I've told you
what happened.

31:03.434 --> 31:04.601
Can't you just charge me?

31:06.300 --> 31:10.365
Why didn't you tell your parents
what Mitchell's daughter said?

31:10.367 --> 31:13.300
And why did you go on
a stag night with a pedophile?

31:16.033 --> 31:17.866
The tech team have retrieved
a number of videos

31:17.868 --> 31:19.632
from Mitchell MacDonald's phone.

31:19.634 --> 31:21.998
These have been forwarded
on to another e-mail account

31:22.000 --> 31:23.765
and then deleted.

31:23.767 --> 31:26.632
Now, this video shows

31:26.634 --> 31:29.765
Will Holt naked
and in a state of arousal,

31:29.767 --> 31:32.601
and it's clear that the
cameraman is Mitchell MacDonald.

31:33.834 --> 31:36.000
You'd better let Vivienne know.

31:40.033 --> 31:43.932
Mitchell showed me porn.

31:43.934 --> 31:47.265
Got me excited.

31:47.267 --> 31:49.901
Got me to take my clothes off.

31:52.367 --> 31:56.167
Mitchell worked out
that I'm gay.

31:56.968 --> 31:58.465
Your parents don't know?

31:58.467 --> 32:00.567
My mum does.

32:02.567 --> 32:05.334
Please don't show the video
to my dad. Please.

32:06.567 --> 32:09.801
I don't see any reason
why we should have to do that.

32:12.934 --> 32:14.901
So, what happened yesterday?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.298
After I spoke to Tamsin,

32:18.300 --> 32:20.131
I told Mitchell
he had to get away

32:20.133 --> 32:23.165
from my mum and my sister.

32:23.167 --> 32:26.165
He threatened he'd show
my dad the video.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.532
Why didn't you tell your mum?

32:28.534 --> 32:29.932
There wasn't time.

32:29.934 --> 32:33.901
The taxi was waiting outside
to take us to Soho.

32:41.968 --> 32:44.732
Will Holt didn't kill
Mitchell MacDonald.

32:44.734 --> 32:47.699
So how do you explain Mitchell's
blood on his hands and clothing?

32:47.701 --> 32:50.165
Okay, um,
Will's knuckles are grazed,

32:50.167 --> 32:52.265
so the bit about punching him
is true.

32:52.267 --> 32:53.866
But the
pathologist's report says

32:53.868 --> 32:55.732
that whoever beat
Mitchell MacDonald to death

32:55.734 --> 32:58.398
would have... have fine blood
spray all over their clothes.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.432
And Will doesn't.
I've checked.

33:00.434 --> 33:04.765
Well, if Will Holt didn't kill
Mitchell MacDonald, who did?

33:04.767 --> 33:06.765
Jacob Holt.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.632
How do you work that one out?

33:08.634 --> 33:11.632
His unauthorized trip
to the South Bank.

33:11.634 --> 33:14.565
Why was he so desperate
to speak to his son?

33:14.567 --> 33:16.765
At first I thought he went
to plant the story

33:16.767 --> 33:18.934
that Mitchell MacDonald
was a pedophile.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.599
But Mitchell MacDonald
<i>was</i> a pedophile.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.899
We found the purchase of
the spy cam in his bank records.

33:25.901 --> 33:27.465
He was the one
who was spying on Gemma.

33:27.467 --> 33:29.899
So maybe Jacob
went to the South Bank

33:29.901 --> 33:31.367
for another reason.

33:32.634 --> 33:35.465
Maybe to persuade Will

33:35.467 --> 33:38.000
that he killed
Mitchell MacDonald.

33:40.067 --> 33:41.765
I just don't buy it.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.732
I mean, what sort of dad
would ask their son

33:43.734 --> 33:45.501
to carry the can for murder?

33:46.534 --> 33:48.265
You're a parent.

33:48.267 --> 33:49.899
Do you believe any father
would do that?

33:49.901 --> 33:51.868
I find it very hard to believe.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.998
Is Billie
still with Helen Holt?

33:58.000 --> 34:02.599
Gemma's playing quite happily,
blissfully unaware.

34:02.601 --> 34:05.367
Helen, do you mind
if I ask you something personal?

34:07.801 --> 34:09.400
It's just it might help Will.

34:10.868 --> 34:12.434
Anything.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.167
Is Jacob Will's father?

34:21.434 --> 34:26.331
Will's father was this... this
guy I met at my aerobics class.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.732
It was just a fling.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.831
I never lied to Jacob.

34:30.833 --> 34:32.699
How did he react?

34:32.701 --> 34:35.966
Well, at first he was angry.

34:35.967 --> 34:37.831
Furious.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.364
But then we talked it over

34:39.367 --> 34:41.899
and agreed to give our marriage
another go.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.831
And a few years later
Gemma came along.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.467
And she's...?

34:46.801 --> 34:48.665
Jacob's?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.398
He adores her.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.868
And he agreed to bring up Will
as his own?

34:55.067 --> 34:56.998
Will doesn't have a clue

34:57.000 --> 34:59.532
that Jacob
isn't his birth father.

34:59.534 --> 35:01.200
He worships him.

35:02.467 --> 35:05.501
And Jacob?
How does he feel about Will?

35:06.734 --> 35:12.467
Well, um, let's just say
it's... it's been a struggle.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.765
Jacob Holt, I am arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

35:21.767 --> 35:23.565
of Mitchell MacDonald.

35:23.567 --> 35:24.899
Have you lost your mind?

35:24.901 --> 35:26.699
You do not have to
say anything,

35:26.701 --> 35:28.131
but it may harm your defense

35:28.133 --> 35:29.632
if you do not mention
when questioned

35:29.634 --> 35:32.031
something which you later
rely on in court.

35:32.033 --> 35:34.532
Anything you do say will be used
in evidence against you.

35:34.534 --> 35:35.901
Do you understand?

35:41.801 --> 35:44.765
I'm sorry I lied about
when Will left the bar,

35:44.767 --> 35:48.434
but I didn't kill
Mitchell MacDonald.

35:51.601 --> 35:53.365
The truth is
when I came outside,

35:53.367 --> 35:55.866
I found Will
standing over Mitchell,

35:55.868 --> 35:57.832
blood everywhere.

35:57.834 --> 36:00.732
When Will explained to me
why he'd done it...

36:00.734 --> 36:03.499
Mitchell was a pedophile...

36:03.501 --> 36:04.767
well, I told him to run.

36:06.634 --> 36:08.365
You're looking after your son.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.932
Exactly.

36:09.934 --> 36:13.065
Except he isn't your son,
is he?

36:13.067 --> 36:14.432
Which might be
why you're prepared

36:14.434 --> 36:16.000
to throw him under the bus.

36:18.133 --> 36:20.098
What do you mean,
he isn't my son?

36:20.100 --> 36:22.832
We spoke to Helen.

36:22.834 --> 36:24.599
And we've got your DNA, his.

36:24.601 --> 36:27.100
Do you want us to do
a paternity test?

36:49.033 --> 36:51.799
So you came out into alley.

36:51.801 --> 36:53.232
Will's standing
over Mitchell.

36:53.234 --> 36:56.732
Presumably Will tells you
he's hit him

36:56.734 --> 36:58.167
because he's after
your daughter.

36:59.567 --> 37:02.398
Is that when you ordered
Will to... to run away?

37:02.400 --> 37:04.131
I'm sure he didn't need
to think twice.

37:04.133 --> 37:07.966
Leaves you face-to-face
with a pedophile.

37:07.968 --> 37:12.067
And here he is
with his head bashed in.

37:13.067 --> 37:15.998
That's his blood
and brain matter.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.098
D.S. Cole, do we know yet
if Mitchell MacDonald

37:19.100 --> 37:20.932
molested Gemma,

37:20.934 --> 37:23.932
or was he just watching her
get undressed on the spy cam

37:23.934 --> 37:25.131
he rigged up in her bedroom?

37:25.133 --> 37:26.799
No, we're still waiting
for a specialist officer

37:26.801 --> 37:28.198
to interview Gemma.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.732
It's a really delicate process,
and...

37:29.734 --> 37:32.499
Oh, you're a social worker.
You're aware.

37:32.501 --> 37:35.165
Rigged a spy cam up
in Gemma's bedroom?

37:35.167 --> 37:36.701
Didn't you know?

37:42.667 --> 37:45.665
The bottle used
to murder Mitchell MacDonald

37:45.667 --> 37:50.899
would be covered in his DNA,
blood, and brain matter.

37:50.901 --> 37:54.432
As well as the fingerprints
and DNA of his killer.

37:54.434 --> 37:56.198
Of course we took yours

37:56.200 --> 37:58.265
for elimination purposes
earlier today,

37:58.267 --> 37:59.732
so thank you for that.

37:59.734 --> 38:03.501
And then there's the blood
on your clothing.

38:04.634 --> 38:06.031
I tried to revive him.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.499
We know.

38:07.501 --> 38:11.065
We also know that whoever hit
Mitchell MacDonald

38:11.067 --> 38:13.098
over the head with a bottle

38:13.100 --> 38:16.234
would have microscopic
blood spray on their clothes.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.133
It's all over your shirt.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.834
The thought of that pervert
anywhere near my daughter...

38:27.968 --> 38:30.198
Are you admitting that
you murdered Mitchell MacDonald?

38:30.200 --> 38:33.732
I couldn't stand that man.

38:33.734 --> 38:35.699
From the moment
I set eyes on him.

38:35.701 --> 38:37.799
I had to just sit there
all night long

38:37.801 --> 38:42.332
while he went on and on
about my wife and my daughter.

38:42.334 --> 38:45.067
The thought of him
even touching Gemma...

38:47.367 --> 38:49.834
When Will told me
what he was...

38:50.834 --> 38:52.367
...I just lost it.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.866
I don't know what's worse...

38:57.868 --> 39:01.565
killing a man or expecting
your son to carry the can.

39:01.567 --> 39:04.632
He's not my son.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.098
What's a couple of years inside
to him?

39:07.100 --> 39:09.465
He's got nothing to lose.

39:09.467 --> 39:13.667
Me, I've got
everything to lose.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.365
You had a blackout.

39:22.367 --> 39:25.098
I woke up
with blood on my hands.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.801
When Dad told me
I killed Mitchell...

39:29.901 --> 39:32.198
Why'd he do that?

39:32.200 --> 39:34.033
Why did he lie?

39:35.434 --> 39:38.067
I think you'd better
talk to your mum about that.

39:38.868 --> 39:42.966
So you just took any old bottle
into an interview?

39:42.968 --> 39:45.065
Talk about audacious policing.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.765
It was worth a punt.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.665
Yeah, but testing every bottle,
that'll take months.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.098
Lucky we've got
his confession, then.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.966
Oh, have you spoken
to Police Scotland?

39:53.968 --> 39:57.532
Yeah, apparently there was
a complaint... of rape.

39:57.534 --> 40:00.765
The school managed to persuade
the victim's parents to drop it

40:00.767 --> 40:02.465
on the condition
that Mitchell MacDonald

40:02.467 --> 40:03.734
resign from teaching.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.133
Thanks so much.

40:40.534 --> 40:42.765
Are you sure she knows
what she's talking about?

40:42.767 --> 40:43.998
She's a trained member

40:44.000 --> 40:46.098
of our sexual offenses
investigation team.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.131
If she's satisfied
Mitchell MacDonald

40:48.133 --> 40:52.400
didn't physically abuse Gemma,
then, yeah, I'd believe her.

40:54.801 --> 40:57.298
Besides, look at her.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.467
Does she look traumatized
to you?

41:12.367 --> 41:15.065
I've just had Kirsten Pryce
on the phone.

41:15.067 --> 41:16.732
The MP?

41:16.734 --> 41:20.465
When we found her son Tom's
body, was he wearing a watch?

41:20.467 --> 41:21.832
Definitely not, no.

41:21.834 --> 41:23.765
Didn't find one
in his possessions either. Why?

41:23.767 --> 41:25.432
Apparently,
she gave him a gold watch

41:25.434 --> 41:28.332
for his 21st, engraved.

41:28.334 --> 41:30.398
She really wants it back.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.932
Well, you know
what Vivienne would say.

41:31.934 --> 41:33.065
What?

41:33.067 --> 41:34.934
The killer probably took it
as a trophy.

42:05.367 --> 42:06.701
Hello!

42:09.100 --> 42:10.400
Hello.

42:12.734 --> 42:16.065
I've, uh, got the money
I owe you.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.365
40 quid.

42:18.367 --> 42:19.501
Thanks.

42:21.767 --> 42:23.465
Cheers.

42:23.467 --> 42:25.265
Seeing as you thought
you'd never get it back,

42:25.267 --> 42:26.968
why don't you use it
to buy me a drink?

42:27.968 --> 42:30.868
- I've got a lot on.
- Okay.

42:32.234 --> 42:34.765
Well, I'll be at the pub
around the corner if you...

42:34.767 --> 42:36.334
if you change your mind.

42:45.968 --> 42:48.465
What have the CPS said
about Will?

42:48.467 --> 42:50.432
They're charging him
with assault.

42:50.434 --> 42:52.365
If he testifies
against his dad,

42:52.367 --> 42:54.298
then that will count
in his favor.

42:54.300 --> 42:56.434
In the meantime,
we can bail him.

42:57.667 --> 43:00.834
That's good.
His mum's gonna need him.

43:01.901 --> 43:03.699
You guys up for a drink?

43:03.701 --> 43:04.966
No, not tonight.

43:04.968 --> 43:07.267
Yeah, me neither.

43:10.601 --> 43:11.734
Okay.

43:14.334 --> 43:18.000
So, um, I'm not a team player.

43:19.434 --> 43:21.267
Apart from when you want to be.

43:22.901 --> 43:25.434
But you've got to admit
I'm a great detective.

43:27.367 --> 43:29.799
Oh, Sarah's bag...

43:29.801 --> 43:31.232
Are you sure
that the misper team

43:31.234 --> 43:32.832
are following it up properly?

43:32.834 --> 43:35.699
Well, they've interviewed
everyone at the party,

43:35.701 --> 43:37.732
and they're
trawling through CCTV,

43:37.734 --> 43:42.131
so hopefully they'll spot
someone carrying it.

43:42.133 --> 43:44.365
Well, if you ever want
a great detective...

43:44.367 --> 43:46.067
I'll know who to call.

43:47.067 --> 43:49.131
Thanks.

43:49.133 --> 43:50.501
Viv.

43:58.667 --> 44:02.532
He... He claimed he found
the body, but he was the killer.

44:02.534 --> 44:05.165
I really messed up today.

44:05.167 --> 44:06.465
No!

44:06.467 --> 44:08.932
No, that's rubbish.
You're...

44:08.934 --> 44:11.599
You're brilliant.
I mean...

44:11.601 --> 44:14.267
Clever!
And good-looking.

44:18.834 --> 44:21.298
Bet you've got someone
real special at home.

44:21.300 --> 44:25.667
I am very, very single.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.699
Don't suppose you'd go out
with me, then,

44:30.701 --> 44:33.234
what with you being a copper
and me being a witness?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.567
No. Absolutely not.
