<i>-Opening night</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:40.036
<i>It's opening night</i>

01:42.560 --> 01:45.791
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:48.673
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

01:48.880 --> 01:51.713
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

01:51.920 --> 01:54.593
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

01:54.800 --> 01:57.314
<i>The doors are open</i>
<i>They're on their way</i>

01:57.520 --> 02:01.752
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:06.591
<i>He's done it again</i>
<i>He's done it again</i>

02:06.800 --> 02:09.473
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

02:09.680 --> 02:12.433
<i>We can't believe it</i>

02:12.640 --> 02:15.393
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

02:15.600 --> 02:18.034
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

02:18.240 --> 02:21.516
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

02:21.720 --> 02:24.359
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

02:24.560 --> 02:27.313
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

02:27.520 --> 02:29.829
<i>There's no denying</i>

02:30.040 --> 02:32.998
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

02:33.200 --> 02:36.078
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

02:36.280 --> 02:40.876
<i>We've seen shit</i>
<i>But never like this</i>

02:41.320 --> 02:44.153
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

02:47.240 --> 02:50.118
<i>The songs were rotten</i>
<i>The book was stinkin'</i>

02:50.320 --> 02:53.551
<i>What he did to Shakespeare</i>
<i>Booth did to Lincoln</i>

02:53.760 --> 02:56.558
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.113
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

03:05.360 --> 03:08.318
<i>What a disaster</i>

03:08.520 --> 03:11.159
<i>We are still in shock</i>

03:11.360 --> 03:13.749
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

03:13.960 --> 03:18.750
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:20.913
<i>What a bum</i>

03:31.800 --> 03:33.358
Hello?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.790
Mr. Bialystock?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.630
Anybody here?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.628
Mr. Bialystock?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.874
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

03:54.080 --> 03:56.116
What do you want?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.595
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

03:59.240 --> 04:01.196
Why don't you speak?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.470
Scared. Can't talk.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.839
All right, I'm sorry.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.759
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.520
Come on. Come on.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.712
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.791
Look, just--

04:19.000 --> 04:21.149
Take a deep breath.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.396
Let it out slowly.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.115
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.675
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

04:31.880 --> 04:34.997
-...and I've come to do your books.
-Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen--

04:35.200 --> 04:38.078
-Who is it?
-Hold Me-Touch Me.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.158
Hold Me-Touch Me.
One of my backers.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.238
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.590
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.396
-But I don't have to go.
-Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.875
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.316
Hold Me-Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me-Touch Me?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.078
Kiss Me-Feel Me,
Clinch Me-Pinch Me...

05:05.280 --> 05:06.474
...Lick Me-Bite Me, Suck Me--

05:06.680 --> 05:08.477
Here she is. Hold Me-Touch Me.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.558
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

05:11.760 --> 05:16.276
-...I didn't have any trouble at all--
-Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.273
Coming. Coming.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.674
Hello, gorgeous.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.032
-Hold me, touch me.
-As soon as I shut the door.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.113
Did you bring the checkie?

05:53.320 --> 05:57.074
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.555
Here you go.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.677
But first,
can we please play a game?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.633
One dirty little game.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.879
All right, my little sex kitten.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.672
What shall we play?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.757
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

06:15.960 --> 06:17.632
-Oh, no.
-No.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.149
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

06:20.360 --> 06:23.238
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.634
I know.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.960
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.110
I don't think I have the strength.

06:44.640 --> 06:50.749
...this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.430
You there, well-hung stableboy.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.989
Won't you please help me?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.999
Of course, my little dairy queen.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.636
First I'll take your milk.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.991
Then I shall take your virginity!

07:11.440 --> 07:14.910
No! No! Never! Never!

07:15.120 --> 07:17.839
Yes. Yes.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.508
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.234
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.432
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.758
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.996
But first, the checkie.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.909
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.268
Here you go.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.834
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

07:55.040 --> 07:56.473
<i>-Cash.</i>
-Yes.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.353
That's a funny name
for a play, <i>Cash</i>.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.199
Yes, so was <i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

08:02.400 --> 08:04.038
I'll see you Thursday.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.117
-Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.153
Yes, yes, yes.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.833
You dirty old buzzard.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.040
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.160
-Yeah, sure.
-I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

08:25.040 --> 08:28.669
-...feeling up the old lady.
-" Feeling up the old lady."

08:28.880 --> 08:30.791
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.957
-May I take your coat?
-Oh, thank you.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.957
So you're an accountant, huh?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.429
-Yes, sir. I am, sir.
-Then account for yourself!

08:38.640 --> 08:41.552
Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.357
I know what you're thinking.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.120
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.595
-Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn--
-Shut up!

08:48.800 --> 08:51.189
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.359
-Do you know who I used to be?
-Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

08:55.560 --> 08:59.758
-...the king of Broadway.
-No, I'm Max Bialy-- That's right.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.838
-That's right.
-And might I say, Mr. Bialystock--

09:03.040 --> 09:05.395
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

09:05.600 --> 09:08.160
-...but you're not just a dirty old man.
-Thank you.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.352
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.279
And there's something about me
you should know.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.913
When I was a kid...

09:16.120 --> 09:19.908
...I had the good fortune
to be taken to <i>Bialy-Hoos of '42</i>.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.031
-Oh, <i>Bialy-Hoos</i>.
-Yes.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.993
And I still have the ticket stub.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.031
-Oh, look at that.
-Yeah.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.198
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

09:30.400 --> 09:33.153
...to be a Broadway producer.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.669
A secret desire, huh?

09:35.880 --> 09:39.077
-Kid, can I give you some advice?
-Yes, sir.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.589
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.791
Top drawer, to the left.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.598
Oh, my God.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.559
Will you look at that.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.595
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

10:01.040 --> 10:03.793
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

10:04.400 --> 10:05.833
-A minute?
-Yes.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.234
-Just one minute?
-Yes.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.396
-Okay.
-ln glancing at your books...

10:09.600 --> 10:12.797
-Go! You have 58 seconds left.
-...I noticed that in the column--

10:13.000 --> 10:15.195
-You're gonna time it?
-Time is money.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.437
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received."

10:18.640 --> 10:21.473
-And I can't make the figures work out.
-Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.116
-There's a problem with your figures.
-Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.550
-Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
-I cannot--

10:27.760 --> 10:29.716
-Fifteen seconds.
-I cannot-- I can't function.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.037
-I cannot function in these conditions.
-Five, four, three, two, one.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.839
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.113
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

10:46.800 --> 10:50.588
My blanket. My blue blanket!

10:50.800 --> 10:53.189
Give me back my blue blanket!

10:53.920 --> 10:58.994
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.757
Give it to me! Give it to me!

11:02.960 --> 11:04.951
Here, here, here.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.311
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.397
I....

11:10.600 --> 11:11.749
I'm sorry.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.679
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.952
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.912
I can deal with it if I want to.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.591
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.994
I need to lie down for a minute now.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.550
They come here. They all come here.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.070
How do they find me?

11:39.480 --> 11:41.914
Hey, kid. Hey.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.834
Look at this.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.393
How can I help you?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.909
-What's wrong?
-You're gonna jump on me.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.838
-What?
-You're gonna jump on me.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.715
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.751
-Oh, God.
-Please, don't jump on me!

11:57.960 --> 12:00.474
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

12:00.680 --> 12:03.194
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

12:03.400 --> 12:05.311
Stop! Calm down!

12:05.520 --> 12:07.590
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.792
-What's the matter now?
-I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.118
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.757
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.235
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.279
I'm wet!

12:32.480 --> 12:35.074
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

12:37.680 --> 12:39.398
I'm in pain.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.431
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

12:41.640 --> 12:44.108
...and I'm still hysterical.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.595
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.949
Move away, you frighten me.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.388
-You're too close.
-I frighten you?

12:51.600 --> 12:55.070
Yes, get over there and stop
touching-- Move over there! Sit down.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.430
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.153
You still look angry.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.113
I'm sorry. How's this?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.994
Who's my little accountant?

13:10.640 --> 13:13.108
Who's my little accountant?

13:13.320 --> 13:16.995
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.918
-Are you my little accountant?
-I am.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.031
Yes, you are.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.637
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.319
Well, you know what they say:

13:27.520 --> 13:30.512
"Smile and the world smiles
with you."

13:31.200 --> 13:33.794
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.673
-You feeling better?
-Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.235
-Good.
-May I speak to you?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.556
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

13:41.760 --> 13:44.991
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.031
I've discovered a serious error...

13:47.240 --> 13:49.834
...in the accounts of your last show,
<i>Funny Boy</i>.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.679
-Where? What?
-Well, according to the backers list...

13:52.880 --> 13:57.874
...you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.752
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.315
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.670
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

14:04.880 --> 14:08.236
...move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.194
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.073
-That's cheating.
-It's not cheating.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.872
It's charity.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.036
Bloom...

14:19.240 --> 14:20.673
...you see this stickpin?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.189
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

14:23.400 --> 14:28.428
I used to wear handmade
ltalian shoes, $500 suits.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.629
And look at me now.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.992
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.119
Bloom, you gotta save me.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.514
I'm reaching out to you.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.314
Don't send me to prison.

14:45.520 --> 14:49.035
Help me.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.073
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.633
-Really?
-Yes, I'll do it.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.434
See, $2000 isn't so much.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.471
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.036
After all, the lRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.196
Right. Good thinking.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.870
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.748
Now, let's see.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.077
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get....

15:17.280 --> 15:19.714
Carry the three, divide by four....

15:21.600 --> 15:24.034
Amazing.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.595
It's absolutely amazing, but...

15:26.800 --> 15:28.279
...under the right circumstances...

15:28.480 --> 15:30.914
...a producer could
make more money with a flop...

15:31.120 --> 15:33.076
...than he could with a hit.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.590
Yes, it's quite possible. lf he were
certain that a show would fail...

15:36.800 --> 15:39.075
...a man could make a fortune.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.077
-Yes?
-Yes, what?

15:41.280 --> 15:43.953
-What you were saying. Keep talking.
-What was I saying?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.593
You were saying that a producer...

15:45.800 --> 15:48.030
...could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.798
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.070
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.989
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.556
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.909
Assume away.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.317
All right. When you produced
your last show, <i>Funny Boy</i>...

16:04.520 --> 16:07.159
...you raised $2000
more than you needed.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.078
But you could've raised a million...

16:09.280 --> 16:11.874
...put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.913
-But what if my show was a hit?
-Then you would go to jail.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.156
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

16:17.360 --> 16:19.430
...you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.030
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.673
-Get it?
-Got it.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.952
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure-fire flop.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.878
"Our schem <i>e''</i> ? What scheme?

16:30.680 --> 16:31.908
What scheme?

16:32.120 --> 16:34.873
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.436
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.676
-It was just a thought.
-Bloom...

16:40.880 --> 16:43.872
...worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.470
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.829
It's so simple.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.270
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.516
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.400
-Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
-Two?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.876
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.231
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.954
And before you can say "step fiv <i>e,''</i>
we close on Broadway...

17:06.160 --> 17:08.913
...take our 2 million and go to Rio.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.554
Rio? That'd never work.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.069
Oh, ye of little faith.

17:15.760 --> 17:19.275
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark</i>
<i>When everything looked bleak?</i>

17:19.480 --> 17:21.117
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

17:21.319 --> 17:24.039
<i>As they struggled</i>
<i>Toward Everest's peak?</i>

17:24.240 --> 17:25.958
<i>What did Washington say</i>
<i>To his troops</i>

17:26.160 --> 17:28.070
<i>As they crossed the Delaware?</i>

17:28.280 --> 17:31.829
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

17:32.040 --> 17:33.712
What'd they say?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.593
<i>We can do it</i>

17:36.800 --> 17:38.552
<i>We can do it</i>

17:38.760 --> 17:42.673
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>Me and you</i>

17:42.880 --> 17:44.438
<i>We can do it</i>

17:44.640 --> 17:46.437
<i>We can do it</i>

17:46.640 --> 17:49.712
<i>We can make our dreams come true</i>

17:49.920 --> 17:52.673
<i>Everything you've ever wanted</i>

17:56.240 --> 17:59.471

17:59.680 --> 18:02.353
<i>Caressing you, undressing you</i>
<i>And driving you mad</i>

18:02.560 --> 18:04.152
No.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.270
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.916
Hear me out. Just think about it.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.632
Stop!

18:23.880 --> 18:26.440
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

18:26.640 --> 18:29.677
<i>This is not the time to shirk</i>

18:29.880 --> 18:32.678
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>You won't rue it</i>

18:32.880 --> 18:35.838
<i>Say goodbye to petty clerk</i>

18:36.040 --> 18:38.998

<i>Yes, producer</i>

<i>We can do it</i>

18:45.840 --> 18:49.958
<i>And I know it's gonna work</i>

18:50.160 --> 18:52.151
What do you say, Bloom?

18:52.360 --> 18:53.793
<i>What do I say?</i>

18:54.000 --> 18:57.436
<i>Finally, a chance to be</i>
<i>A Broadway producer</i>

18:57.640 --> 18:58.789
<i>What do I say?</i>

18:59.000 --> 19:02.117
<i>Finally, a chance to make</i>
<i>My dreams come true, sir</i>

19:02.320 --> 19:05.073
<i>What do I say?</i>
<i>What do I say?</i>

19:05.280 --> 19:08.989
<i>Here's what I say to you, sir</i>

19:10.080 --> 19:13.311
<i>I can't do it</i>

19:13.520 --> 19:16.796

<i>Beautiful girls</i>

19:33.000 --> 19:36.037
<i>Chasing me, embracing me</i>
<i>I'd have an attack</i>

19:36.240 --> 19:39.550
Why, you miserable, cowardly,
wretched little caterpillar.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.198
Don't you ever wanna become
a butterfly?

19:54.120 --> 19:55.553
-Where to?
-Central Park.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.354
Gotta breathe. Gotta breathe.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.069
<i>-We can do it</i>

Fail? How could it miss?
All you need is a little courage.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.634
Bloom, you know what you are?
You're like a--

20:59.840 --> 21:01.558
You're like a....

21:01.760 --> 21:05.753
You're like a fountain waiting
to explode and shoot into the sky!

21:05.960 --> 21:08.349
-I'm a fountain?
-Yes, you're a fountain!

21:08.560 --> 21:13.111
Don't you realize? There's a lot more
to you than there is to you.

21:13.320 --> 21:17.108
Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made
a terribl <i>e e</i> rror in judgment.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.550
You've mistaken me
for someone with a spine.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.320
I'm going back
to Whitehall & Marks now.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.717
-Goodbye forever.
-Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute! Bloom.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.040

You can't come and go as you please.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.593
-Yes, Mr. Marks.
-Remember, you're a nobody.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.429
A PA. A public accountant.

22:41.640 --> 22:46.760
And I am a CPA.
A certified public accountant.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.913

22:52.120 --> 22:54.554
Yes, Mr. Marks.

I've changed my mind.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.035
Boy, you are good.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.269
-Who are you talking to?
-Never mind, just an old friend.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.552
-What happened?
-Oh, just this--

30:06.760 --> 30:10.230
Just this: When I said that I was
scared that I was gonna go to jail...

30:10.440 --> 30:14.115
...I didn't realize
that I already was in jail.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.993
I've spent my life counting
other people's money.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.316
People I'm smarter than...

30:19.520 --> 30:21.158
...better than.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.113
When's Leopold Bloom
gonna get his share?

30:24.320 --> 30:28.950
When's it gonna be Bloom's day?
I want-- I want--

30:31.080 --> 30:35.676
I want everything
I'v <i>e e</i> ver seen in the movies.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.399
And, Leo, you're gonna have it.
Because....

30:39.600 --> 30:43.878
<i>-We can do it, we can do it</i>
<i>-I'm gonna be a producer</i>

30:44.080 --> 30:46.958
<i>Say goodbye to woe and gloom</i>

30:47.160 --> 30:50.277
<i>-With your brilliance, my resilience</i>
<i>-I'm gonna be a producer</i>

30:50.480 --> 30:53.313
<i>-Up together we will zoom</i>
<i>-Up together we will zoom</i>

30:53.520 --> 30:56.432
<i>-We can do it, we can do it</i>
<i>-We can do it, we can do it</i>

30:56.640 --> 30:59.632
<i>Every show I touch I doom</i>

30:59.840 --> 31:01.319
<i>-We were fated</i>
<i>-We were fated</i>

31:01.520 --> 31:02.999
<i>-To be mated</i>
<i>-To be mated</i>

31:03.200 --> 31:09.309
<i>-We're Bialystock and Bloom</i>
<i>-We're Bialystock and Bloom</i>

31:24.240 --> 31:25.673
Oh, Max....

31:25.880 --> 31:28.838
Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.396
-How many plays can a person read?
-Stop complaining.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.591
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.631
-I've been reading all night.
-Who cares?

31:36.840 --> 31:39.912
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.513
Here's one.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.472
Act I, scene one.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.114
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

31:48.320 --> 31:52.518
...that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

31:53.760 --> 31:55.830
No, too good.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.555
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted."

32:02.760 --> 32:06.435
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.633
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.353
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

32:12.560 --> 32:15.074
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.157
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.830
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.678
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.758
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.111
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.914
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.348
It's the mother lode.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.516
-What is it? You found a flop?
-A flop.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.392
That's putting it mildly.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.238
This is a catastrophe.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.718
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.992
A guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night
beauty.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.839
-Well, let's see it.
-Here.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.676
<i>''Springtime for Hitler...</i>

33:03.880 --> 33:07.555
...a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden."

33:09.920 --> 33:12.036
Oh, my God.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.794
"Oh, my God" is right.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.878
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.516
-Max, this won't run a week.
-A week? Are you kidding?

33:20.720 --> 33:24.030
This play has got to close
on page four.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.559
What's the author's name again?

33:25.760 --> 33:29.958
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York."

33:30.160 --> 33:33.118
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

33:33.320 --> 33:37.632
Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>...

33:37.840 --> 33:39.831
...even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.394
-Come on.
-This other hat, Max...

33:43.600 --> 33:44.999
...may I wear it?

33:45.200 --> 33:47.156
-No, you may not.
-Why?

33:47.360 --> 33:51.433
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.949
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

33:54.160 --> 33:56.355
...until you're a Broadway producer.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.278
And you're not
a Broadway producer until--

33:58.480 --> 34:01.711
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.469
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because....

34:05.680 --> 34:08.558
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

34:08.760 --> 34:12.672
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

34:21.679 --> 34:21.918
<i>Ja, ja</i>, my <i>Lieblings</i>.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.556
Let me grab you here.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.751
We have work to do.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.953
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

34:34.159 --> 34:37.914
...which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

34:38.120 --> 34:42.033
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

34:42.239 --> 34:44.514
...Buenos Aires, Argentina.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.551
AQAP.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.318
As quick as possible.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.351
Good.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.916
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

34:55.480 --> 34:57.471
Hilda, where are you going?

34:57.680 --> 35:00.035
Argentina's that way!

35:00.960 --> 35:02.678
Okay, chow time.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.914
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.953
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

35:14.160 --> 35:18.358
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.279
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

35:21.480 --> 35:25.155
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.516
Franz Liebkind?

35:28.720 --> 35:31.712
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

35:31.920 --> 35:33.353
I only followed orders.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.835
I had nothing to do with the war.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.951
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.392
We lived in the back...

35:40.600 --> 35:42.158
...right across from Switzerland.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.555
All w <i>e e</i> ver heard was yodelling.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.311
-Who are you?!
-Relax.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.556
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.955
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

35:58.160 --> 36:00.799
-...here to talk to you about your play.
-My play?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.560
You mean <i>Springtime for</i>...

36:04.040 --> 36:06.110
-...you-know-who?
-That's the one.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.312
-What about it?
-We love it. Don't we love it?

36:09.520 --> 36:12.751
-We think it's a masterpiece.
-We want to put it on Broadway.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.350
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.915
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.430
...Adolf.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.039
Do you hear?

36:29.240 --> 36:32.516
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.792
Broadway!

36:36.880 --> 36:39.314
You know,
not many people know this...

36:39.520 --> 36:43.069
-...but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
-Really?

36:43.280 --> 36:46.955
-We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
-No, no, we sure didn't.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.709
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

36:50.920 --> 36:53.878
Filthy British lies!

36:54.080 --> 36:58.437
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

36:58.640 --> 37:00.835
Churchill!

37:01.640 --> 37:06.077
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.713
Rotten!

37:07.920 --> 37:09.148
Hitler.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.952
There was a painter.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.958
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.991
Two coats.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.395
Yes. Yes.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.795
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.673
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.917
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

37:27.120 --> 37:30.590
...the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.712
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

37:33.920 --> 37:36.036
...and make your dream a reality.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.156
-No.
-That's what <i>''nein''</i> means.

37:39.360 --> 37:43.148
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

37:43.360 --> 37:47.717
...by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

37:47.920 --> 37:49.797
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

37:50.640 --> 37:52.039
I know.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.435
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

37:54.640 --> 37:56.551
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

37:56.760 --> 37:57.875
Delighted. Delighted.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.594
-...song.
-Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

38:00.800 --> 38:04.031
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.677
-Rolling?
-Rolling.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.030
-Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
-Alrighty.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.434
-Good.
-Good.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.471
-Key of E?
-ls there any other?

38:18.640 --> 38:21.950
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

38:22.160 --> 38:25.596
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>Und oh, boy</i>

38:25.800 --> 38:29.315
<i>Guten Tag clap clap</i>
<i>Guten Tag slap slap</i>

38:29.520 --> 38:31.988
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>What a joy</i>

38:32.200 --> 38:36.432
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen</i>
<i>Und tanzen und trinken</i>

38:36.640 --> 38:40.030
<i>Tanzen und trinken</i>
<i>Until we get stinkin'</i>

38:40.240 --> 38:42.800
-Everybody!
<i>-Guten Tag hop hop</i>

38:43.000 --> 38:44.399
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

38:44.880 --> 38:48.236
<i>Guten Tag</i>
<i>Mein lieber Schatz</i>

38:48.440 --> 38:51.796
<i>So we hop our hops</i>
<i>Und we clop our clops</i>

38:52.000 --> 38:56.198
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps</i>
<i>Till we platz</i>

38:56.400 --> 38:58.868
You will sway?

38:59.760 --> 39:02.513
We will sway.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.238
Follow me.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.192
Very good.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.231
Whatever you say.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.758
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

39:49.040 --> 39:52.669
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

39:57.320 --> 39:59.675
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.633
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.319
Excellent. Excellent.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.715
Here we are. Here.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.557
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.512
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

40:20.720 --> 40:23.996
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.428
Never...

40:25.640 --> 40:27.631
...took that oath before.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.116
One for me, one for you,
<i>und</i> one for you.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.517
Never-- Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.915
-You're welcome.
-Nice colours.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.758
Oh, look, reversible.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.315
-Oh, yeah, you're right.
-Max.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.954
Max, we never
should have started this.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.196
I think we're getting in too deep.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.311
Too deep? This is nothing.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.080
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.713
All right.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.309
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

40:55.520 --> 40:57.476
...<i>und</i> repeat after me.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.955
I solemnly swear...

41:00.160 --> 41:03.630
-I solemnly swear...
-I solemnly swear...

41:03.840 --> 41:06.752
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.748
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.678
<i>-Und...</i>
<i>-Und...</i>

41:12.880 --> 41:14.029
<i>Und...</i>

41:14.240 --> 41:16.356
...never, never, never...

41:16.560 --> 41:19.996
-...never, never, never...
-...never, never, never...

41:21.720 --> 41:27.158
...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the memory
of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.397
-...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the--
-...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the--

41:30.600 --> 41:31.874
-Elizabeth?
-Elizabeth?

41:32.080 --> 41:35.834
<i>Ja</i>, that was his middle name.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.632
Not many people know this...

41:37.840 --> 41:43.870
...but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.156
ls that right?

41:51.360 --> 41:52.839
Yes.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.039
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.471
-Good. Now I sign your contract.
-Excellent! Excellent.

41:59.680 --> 42:02.638
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.158
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.193
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.197
Thank you.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.156
Let it go. Let it go.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.918
Halt!

42:17.120 --> 42:18.439
I forgot to tell you.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.870
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

42:24.080 --> 42:26.116
...is dess.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.038
" Dess"?

42:28.240 --> 42:29.878
ls that anything lik <i>e ''</i> death"?

42:30.080 --> 42:32.389
Yeth.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.552
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

42:35.760 --> 42:38.718
...we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.956
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go....

42:44.560 --> 42:47.393
We're trapped! Trapped!

42:47.960 --> 42:49.313
Got it.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.238
Let's have lunch.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.630
What nice guys.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.193
Broadway.

42:58.400 --> 43:02.359
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.359
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

43:08.560 --> 43:11.233
...Roger DeBris <i>' e</i> legant
Upper East Side townhouse...

43:11.440 --> 43:14.671
...on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.269
Who may I say is calling?

43:17.920 --> 43:19.831
Listen, you broken-down
old queen...

43:20.040 --> 43:22.190
...he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.470
-Don't ever call here again.
-Who was that?

43:24.680 --> 43:26.636
Wrong number.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.916
Yes?

44:02.440 --> 44:04.510
Well, hi there.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.951
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.754
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

44:10.960 --> 44:13.474
-...Roger DeBris.
-Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

44:13.680 --> 44:16.274
-Please. Yes.
-Thank you.

44:26.120 --> 44:28.429
I am Carmen Ghia...

44:28.640 --> 44:31.837
...Mr. DeBris'
common-law assistant.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.110
You ar <i>e e</i> xpected.

44:39.880 --> 44:44.670
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

44:45.240 --> 44:48.198
Oh, these. We-- We--

44:48.400 --> 44:51.949
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.000
-You didn't tell me we had those on?
-I didn't notice them.

44:56.200 --> 45:01.638
-You told me to look straight ahead.
-Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

45:05.400 --> 45:07.709
Oh, Roger.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.753
We're not alone.

45:20.880 --> 45:24.839
Here's Roger.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.228
-Max, he's wearing a dress.
-No kidding.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.317
Roger, good to see you again.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.512
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.517
Forgive the pun.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.511
-What pun?
-Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

45:44.720 --> 45:49.157
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.199
By the way, Max, darling,
we loved <i>Funny Boy</i>, didn't we?

45:53.400 --> 45:54.435
Worshipped it.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.835
<i>To be or not to be</i>
<i>You mean a lot to me</i>

45:57.040 --> 45:59.190
-Showstopper!
-Fabulous.

46:00.080 --> 46:03.038
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.637
-Well, I was--
-I should explain.

46:05.840 --> 46:09.469
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

46:09.680 --> 46:13.434
-We always win.
-I'm not so sure about this year.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.552
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

46:16.760 --> 46:19.877
...but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

46:21.160 --> 46:24.835
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

46:25.040 --> 46:28.157
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

46:28.360 --> 46:31.750
...oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.078
lf your intention...

46:36.280 --> 46:40.831
...was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

46:42.160 --> 46:44.151
...bull's-eye!

46:47.920 --> 46:51.276
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

46:51.480 --> 46:54.119
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

46:54.320 --> 46:56.311
...but did you read
<i>Springtime for Hitler</i> ?

46:56.520 --> 46:58.670
Read it? I devoured it.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.110
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

47:01.320 --> 47:05.074
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.352
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

47:08.560 --> 47:10.516
...meant Germany.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.995
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

47:13.200 --> 47:17.193
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

47:17.400 --> 47:21.359
World War ll?
Too dark, too depressing.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.279
<i>The theatre's so obsessed</i>
<i>With dramas so depressed</i>

47:24.480 --> 47:27.358
<i>It's hard to sell a ticket on Broadway</i>

47:27.560 --> 47:30.870
<i>Shows should be more pretty</i>
<i>Shows should be more witty</i>

47:31.080 --> 47:32.593
<i>Shows should be more</i>

47:32.800 --> 47:34.950
<i>What's the word?</i>

47:35.160 --> 47:37.913
-Gay?
-Exactly.

47:38.120 --> 47:41.749
<i>No matter what you do on the stage</i>

47:41.960 --> 47:45.111
<i>Keep it light, keep it bright</i>
<i>Keep it gay</i>

47:45.320 --> 47:48.915
<i>Whether it's murder</i>
<i>Mayhem or rage</i>

47:49.120 --> 47:53.159
<i>Don't complain, it's a pain</i>
<i>Keep it gay</i>

47:53.360 --> 47:56.511
<i>People want laughter</i>
<i>When they see a show</i>

47:56.720 --> 47:59.871
<i>The last thing they're after is</i>
<i>A litany of woe</i>

48:00.080 --> 48:03.709
<i>A happy ending</i>
<i>Will pep up your play</i>

48:03.920 --> 48:05.512
Oedipus <i>won't bomb</i>

48:05.720 --> 48:07.278
<i>If he winds up with Mom</i>

48:07.480 --> 48:09.072
-<i>Keep it gay</i>
-<i>Keep it gay</i>

48:09.280 --> 48:11.396
<i>-Keep it gay</i>
<i>-Keep it gay</i>

48:11.600 --> 48:12.828
Couldn't agree more.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.598
And you have our blessings,
Roger...

48:14.800 --> 48:18.588
...to mak <i>e Springtime for Hitler</i> just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.199
So come on, do it for us. Please.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.358
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.028
Still, fair is fair.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.515
I should ask my production team
what they think.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.153
Your production team,
who are they?

48:30.360 --> 48:32.351
You'll see. They all live here.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.711
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

48:35.920 --> 48:38.150
This is my set designer, Brian.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.315
Hello.

48:39.520 --> 48:42.557
<i>Keep it mad, keep it glad</i>
<i>Keep it gay</i>

48:42.760 --> 48:46.435
-Here's my costume designer, Kevin.
-Hello.

48:46.640 --> 48:50.189
<i>Keep it happy, keep it snappy</i>
<i>Keep it gay</i>

48:50.400 --> 48:53.836
<i>We're clever, creative</i>
<i>It's our job to see</i>

48:54.040 --> 48:57.396
<i>That everything's perfect</i>
<i>For Mr. DeBris</i>

48:57.600 --> 48:59.670
Scott, my choreographer.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.472
Hi there.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.759
And, finally, last and least...

49:19.960 --> 49:23.714
...my lighting designer,
Shirley Markowitz.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.913

<i>Keep it gay</i>

49:28.120 --> 49:30.998
<i>Keep it gay</i>

49:35.120 --> 49:38.271
Now, they all just read <i>Springtime</i>.
What did you think of it, fellas?

49:38.480 --> 49:40.357
-<i>It needs glamour</i>
-<i>And glitz</i>

49:40.560 --> 49:43.711
-<i>It needs sequins</i>
-<i>And tits</i>

49:43.920 --> 49:47.230
Leo. Leo, I think we're losing them.

49:47.440 --> 49:50.318
Go say something nice to Roger.
I think he likes you.

49:50.520 --> 49:54.433
-But, Max....
-Go on. It's just show biz.

49:59.560 --> 50:02.393
Mr. DeBris. Roger.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.956
Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

50:06.160 --> 50:07.798
Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.797
Leo.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.469
What is that enchanting
cologne you're wearing?

50:13.680 --> 50:15.238
Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.716
You mean that smell is you?

50:18.920 --> 50:20.956
Oh, God.

50:21.160 --> 50:27.110
lf I could bottle you, I'd shove you
under my armpits every day.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.276
Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

50:38.480 --> 50:42.439
-I think we're getting in too deep.
-Too deep? This is nothing.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.835
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.236
<i>And so the rule is</i>

50:47.440 --> 50:49.476
<i>When mounting a play</i>

50:49.680 --> 50:51.398
<i>Keep it funny</i>
<i>Keep it sunny</i>

50:51.600 --> 50:53.591
<i>Keep it gay</i>

50:53.800 --> 50:57.679
-What should we do?
-Relax. Watch this.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.030
Roger, I--

51:00.240 --> 51:04.836
I think that <i>Springtime for Hitler</i> would
be a marvellous opportunity for you.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.873
I mean, up to now,
you've always been associated with--

51:08.080 --> 51:09.957
Dare I say it? --frivolous musicals.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.037
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

51:12.240 --> 51:14.913
...I've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.680
Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.348
Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn,
kick, turn.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.232
-Roger.
-It's enough to make you heave.

51:22.440 --> 51:25.637
Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max, I just
couldn't do <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.558
-Why not? Think of the respect.
-No.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.318
-Think of the prestige.
-No, no, no.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.919
Think of the Tony!

51:31.960 --> 51:35.555
<i>Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony</i>

51:35.760 --> 51:37.352
-What's the matter?
-ls he all right?

51:37.560 --> 51:38.709
-He's having a stroke.
-What?

51:38.920 --> 51:40.990
-Of genius!
-I see it at last.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.191
The chance
to do something important.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.358
<i>Roger DeBris presents</i>
<i>History</i>

51:46.560 --> 51:48.516
Of course that second act
has to be rewritten.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.917

55:36.600 --> 55:40.513
We don't have the time.
We'll just call you Ulla.

55:40.720 --> 55:42.950
Okay? Yeah. What do you do, Ulla?

55:43.160 --> 55:45.355
-Ulla sing and dance.
-Oh, yeah?

55:45.560 --> 55:48.358
-You want Ulla make audition?
-Oh, no, miss.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.630
-That won't be nece--
-Yes, it is " nec <i>e.''</i>

55:50.840 --> 55:51.989
Extremely nece.

55:52.200 --> 55:56.318
Please. Please make audition.
Make audition all over the office.

55:57.800 --> 56:00.030
-What are you going to sing?
-Well...

56:00.240 --> 56:05.792
...yesterday when I was stepping out
of a big, white Rolls-Royce limo...

56:06.000 --> 56:08.912
...a crazy man
yelled something out the window...

56:09.120 --> 56:11.554
...that inspired me to write this song.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.029
<i>When you got it</i>

56:20.240 --> 56:22.037
<i>Flaunt it</i>

56:22.240 --> 56:25.437
<i>Step right up and strut your stuff</i>

56:26.680 --> 56:29.592
<i>People tell you modesty's a virtue</i>

56:30.840 --> 56:34.549
<i>But in the theatre</i>
<i>Modesty can hurt you</i>

56:34.760 --> 56:35.988
<i>When you got it</i>

56:37.240 --> 56:39.231
<i>Flaunt it</i>

56:39.440 --> 56:43.319
<i>Show your assets</i>
<i>Let 'em know you're proud</i>

56:43.520 --> 56:45.112
<i>Your goodies you must push</i>

56:45.320 --> 56:47.390
<i>Stick your chest out</i>
<i>Shake your tush</i>

56:47.600 --> 56:51.718
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Shout it out loud</i>

56:52.080 --> 56:53.877
Now Ulla dance.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.476
<i>When you got it</i>

57:10.680 --> 57:12.477
<i>Show it</i>

57:12.680 --> 57:16.275
<i>Put your hidden treasures</i>
<i>On display</i>

57:16.480 --> 57:19.836
<i>Violinists love to play an E string</i>

57:20.040 --> 57:23.396
<i>But audiences really love a G-string</i>

57:23.600 --> 57:25.511
<i>When you got it</i>

57:25.720 --> 57:27.233
<i>Shout it</i>

57:27.440 --> 57:31.228
<i>Let the whole world hear</i>
<i>What you're about</i>

57:31.440 --> 57:34.432
<i>Clothes may make the man</i>
<i>All a girl needs is a tan</i>

57:34.880 --> 57:38.839
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Let it hang out</i>

57:39.040 --> 57:40.917
-Remember when Ulla dance?
-Yeah.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.269
Ulla dance again.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.952
Ulla dance again!

58:01.560 --> 58:05.235
<i>When I was just a little girl</i>
<i>In Sweden</i>

58:05.440 --> 58:09.149
<i>My thoughtful mother</i>
<i>Gave me this advice</i>

58:09.360 --> 58:12.989
<i>If nature blesses you</i>
<i>From top to bottom</i>

58:13.200 --> 58:15.953
<i>Show that top to bottom</i>
<i>Don't think twice</i>

58:16.160 --> 58:18.196
Now Ulla belt.

58:18.400 --> 58:22.109
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

58:22.320 --> 58:24.470
<i>When you got it</i>

58:24.680 --> 58:26.238
<i>Share it</i>

58:26.440 --> 58:30.149
<i>Let the public feast</i>
<i>Upon your charms</i>

58:30.360 --> 58:33.875
<i>People say that being prim</i>
<i>Is proper</i>

58:34.080 --> 58:37.231
<i>But every showgirl knows</i>
<i>That prim will stop her</i>

58:37.440 --> 58:39.670
<i>When you got it</i>

58:39.880 --> 58:41.552
<i>Give it</i>

58:41.760 --> 58:46.515
<i>Don't be selfish</i>
<i>Give it all away</i>

58:51.120 --> 58:52.678
<i>Don't be shy</i>
<i>Be bold and cute</i>

58:52.880 --> 58:54.598
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

58:54.800 --> 58:57.792
<i>When you got it</i>

58:58.600 --> 59:01.592
<i>If you got it</i>

59:02.400 --> 59:05.358
<i>Once you got it</i>

59:05.560 --> 59:07.710
<i>Shout out</i>

59:10.080 --> 59:14.039
<i>Hooray!</i>

59:21.040 --> 59:22.519
Okey-dokey.

59:22.720 --> 59:23.869
You like it?

59:24.080 --> 59:26.275
Like-- Like it?

59:26.480 --> 59:29.870
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

59:30.080 --> 59:33.959
...we're giving you
a standing ovation.

59:38.560 --> 59:41.154
She's in the show.

59:41.360 --> 59:46.115
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

59:46.320 --> 59:49.153
Would you excuse us, my dear?

59:49.360 --> 59:51.078
Nonsense, Bloom.

59:51.280 --> 59:53.157
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

59:53.360 --> 59:55.669
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

59:55.880 --> 59:58.440
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.474
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.478
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:10.276
Because we need--
Nay, des <i>erve</i> to have ourselves a--

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.479
Des <i>erve</i> to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.389
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.318
They'll say:

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.874
Offer her the job, please?

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.159
Just a moment, miss.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.193
We might have a position for you.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.188
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.833
Until the show gets going...

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.318
...we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.751
Secretary/receptionist?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.394
Okey/dokey!

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.749
I can do that.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.035
Answer telephone.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.151
Bialystock and Bloom.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.918
Bialystock and Bloom.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.314
Smart as a whip.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.556
You're hired!

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.829
Well-- Well, all right. lf he says so,
I don't have a--

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.190
Secretary/receptionist.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.709
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.717
Tidy up? Tidy up.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.150
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.920
-You know, clean.
-Make look nice.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.430
-Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
-Very good.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.676
What time can you be here
in the morning?

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.997
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a.m.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.555
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.752
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.839
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.871
Many different herrings.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.709
From to 9 to 11 , Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.356
And at 11 , Ulla like to have sex.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.790
What time should I get here?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.069
-Eleven.
-Eleven.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.874
Good. Ulla will come at 11 .

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.753
Ulla will come at 11 .

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.040
God bless America!

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.954
God bless Sweden.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.676
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.348
The most beautiful girl
I'v <i>e e</i> ver seen.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.073
I've never felt this way before.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.272
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.315
...like hot lava rising higher
and higher and--

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.351
What is that, Max?

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.596
What is it?

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.795
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.795
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.280
Come here,
I want to show you something.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.232
-What do you see?
-Nothing.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.671
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure-fire flop...

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.031
...it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.869
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.515
How much--?
How much do we put in?

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.358
Bloom...

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.791
...the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.197
...are one, never put
your own money in the show.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.549
And two?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.153
Never put your own money
in the show!

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.039
-Get it?
-Got it.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.151
-Good.
-So how do we raise the money?

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.920
How? I'll tell you how.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.479
From my investors.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.432
Hundreds of little old ladies...

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.509
...all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.395
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.830
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.951
Scram while I get myself ready.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.835
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.349
...into little-old-lady land.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.598
<i>The time has come</i>

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.998
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.512
<i>To slick my hair down</i>
<i>With brilliantine</i>

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.909
<i>And gargle heavily</i>
<i>With Listerine</i>

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.557
<i>It's time for Max</i>

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.470
<i>To put his backers on their backs</i>

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:41.834
<i>And thrill them with amazing acts</i>

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.634
<i>Those aging nymphomaniacs</i>

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.470
<i>They were helpless</i>
<i>They were hopeless</i>

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.990
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.670
<i>They were joyless</i>
<i>They were boy-less</i>

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.156
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.830
<i>They're my angels</i>
<i>I'm their devil</i>

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.555
<i>And I keep those embers aglow</i>

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.150
<i>When I woos 'em</i>
<i>I can't lose 'em</i>

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.351
<i>'Cause I cast my spell</i>
<i>And they start yellin'</i>

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.834
<i>''Fire down below!''</i>

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.396
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>They were frantic</i>

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.229
<i>Then their prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.032
<i>Heaven sent them</i>

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.832
<i>Their Bialy</i>

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:40.434
<i>I'm the celebration of love</i>

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.273
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.198
It's Max Bialystock.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.997
Maxy.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.788
Fire down below!

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.594
<i>We were listing</i>
<i>We were sinking</i>

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.031
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.198
<i>We were desperate</i>
<i>We were drinking</i>

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.597
<i>-Then along came Bialy</i>
-Who's your daddy?

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.792
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>We were frantic</i>

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.231
<i>Then our prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.714
<i>It's Bialy</i>

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.319
<i>Hey, Bialy</i>

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.351
<i>He's the culmination</i>

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.993
<i>The restoration</i>

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.633
<i>The consummation</i>

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.034
<i>The titillation</i>

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.593
<i>Ejaculation</i>

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.351
<i>He's the celebration of love</i>

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.636
Thank you.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.191
Bloom! Bloom!

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.390
What, Max? What?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.160
I've done it. I've done it,
I've raised the 2 million.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:28.078
Now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.430
That's great!

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:41.549
<i>We can't miss</i>

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.912
I gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3:00 or else--

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.314
Sorry, wrong office.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.350
Bialystock. Bloom.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.832
Max. Leo.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.796
-Ulla?
-Ulla?

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:29.792
What happened to the office?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.832
Like you tell Ulla, "tidy up."

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.234
Tidy "oop"?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.317
How did you find the time
to do all this?

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.796
-I skip lunch.
-Of course you did.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.594
-Very nice.
-She skipped lunch.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.471
Almost 3.
That payment to the Shuberts.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.113
I'll get the cash from the safe.

01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:49.310
You make sure
all those contracts are signed.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.747
Yes, Max.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.630
She painted over the numbers.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.996
Hello, boys.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.713
Nobody knows
what I went through to get you.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.319
Ulla knows.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.513
You had to shtupp
every little old lady in New York.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.675
That's right. That's right.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.318
And I've still got
the denture bites to prove it.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.150
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.395
So, Mr. Bloom.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.795
We are all alone.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.749
Yes, we are, aren't we?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.596
Why Bloom go so far camera right?

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.040
Bloom no like Ulla?

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.714
Ulla like Bloom.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.236
Bloom like Ulla, all right.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.318
-Maybe a little too much.
-Good.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.511
I'm glad.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.351
Why Bloom need blue blanket?

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.152
Oh, it's not important.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.271
It's just a minor compulsion.
It's that I've--

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.153
I've had it ever since
I was a baby, and I....

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.158
You're a little too close.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.917
<i>The urge to merge</i>
<i>Can rob us of our senses</i>

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.591
<i>The need to breed</i>
<i>Can make a man a drone</i>

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.032
<i>We must be on alert</i>
<i>With our defences</i>

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.391
<i>For every skirt will test</i>

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.197
<i>Testosterone</i>

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.029
<i>So knowing this</i>
<i>I severed all connection</i>

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.471
<i>With any creature</i>
<i>Sporting silk or lace</i>

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.878
<i>I was firmly headed</i>
<i>In the right direction</i>

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.119
<i>When suddenly I stumbled on</i>

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.551
<i>That face</i>

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.190
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.391
<i>That dangerous face</i>

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.639
<i>I mustn't be unwise</i>

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.876
<i>Those lips</i>
<i>That nose</i>

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.116
<i>Those eyes</i>

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.393
<i>Could lead to my demise</i>

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.511
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.631
<i>That marvellous face</i>

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.913
<i>I never should begin</i>

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.111
<i>Those cheeks</i>
<i>That neck</i>

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.231
<i>That chin</i>

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.558
<i>Will surely do me in</i>

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.796
<i>I must be smart</i>
<i>And hide my heart</i>

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.070
<i>If she's within a mile</i>

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.953
<i>If I don't duck</i>
<i>I'm out of luck</i>

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:52.029
<i>She'd kill me with her smile</i>

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.076
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.157
<i>That fabulous face</i>

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.478
<i>It's clear I must beware</i>

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.591
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.631
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.068
<i>But it's worth it</i>

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.352
<i>For that face</i>

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.591
Bloom help Ulla down?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.629
All right. Bloom help Ulla down.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.998
<i>That face</i>

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.633
<i>That face</i>

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.358
<i>That lovable face</i>

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:58.831
<i>It melts my Swedish heart</i>

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.159
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.753
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.316
<i>But it's worth it</i>

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.594
<i>For that face</i>

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.633
Again! Arabesque, prepare...

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.671
...pirouette and twirl.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.871
And goose step, goose step...

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.518
Shut up!

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.193
We must have some order here.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.073
Will all the dancing Hitlers
please wait off-stage right...

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.670
...and all the singing Hitlers
off-stage left.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.958
Get that way.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.993
Carmen,
call in a singing Hitler, please.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.555

"Jacques LaPidus."

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.716
"Jack Lapidus."

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.958
Well, Jack, what are you
going to sing for us?

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.790
I would like to sing
"A Wandering Minstrel I."

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.997
lf you must.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.596
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>

" Donald Dinsmor <i>e.''</i>

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.750
Well, Donald, if we--

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.629
Well, Donald, I--

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.876
-Hi, how are you?
-That's all right, Donald.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.510
Now, what are you
going to sing for us, friend?

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.555
I'd like to sing
"The Little Wooden Boy."

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.718
Thank you.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.035
Well, Jason,
what have you been up to lately?

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.233
For the last 16 years, I have been
touring in <i>No No Nietzsche</i>.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.670
-You played Nietzsche?
-No, no.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.359
What are you gonna sing for us?

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.755
" Have You Ever Heard
the German Band?"

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.951
-No.
-That is the name of the song...

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.230
...I am going to sing.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.153
Play it, please.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.199
Speed it up.

Halt! No, no, no.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.073
This man could never play
Adolf Hitler.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.919
The Führer wasn't
a mousy little mama's boy.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.519
The Führer was butch!

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.119
And that is not how you sing...

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.912
..." Haben Sie geh <i>ö</i> rt

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.588
This is how you sing " Haben Sie

B-flat. Two-two time!

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.910
Modulate at the bridge!

This way, please.
This way, please.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.236
Take your seats.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.389
Good evening, sir. Nice to see you.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.989
-Enjoy the show.
-Thank you.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.393
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.876
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.119
Leo!

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.838
Leo, who said
you could wear that hat?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.476
Nobody, Max. But I thought now that
I'm the producer of a Broadway show--

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.193
-Has the curtain gone up yet?
-No.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.238
-Has the curtain come down yet?
-No.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.670
Then you're not a producer yet.
Give me that hat.

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.314
Mr. Bloom! Leo.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.988
Your tie is all askew.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.430
Askew. Oh, thank you, Ulla.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.631
Have a good show.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.798
Roll them in the aisles.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.274
Okey-dokey.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.038
I will try to.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.118
But there's just so many of them.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.113
Gee, I thought we were partners,
sharing everything 50-50.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.437
Now I'm out in the cold, and you two
are busy askewing each other.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.039
Askewing? Never, Max.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.391
Hugs and kisses, yes,
but that's as far as I go.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.756
Gunter, you will pick me up back here
right after the curtain.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.636
Oh, God, will they love us?
Will they hate us?

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.955
The suspense is killing me.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.311
I know.
I feel like I'm going into labour.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.711
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom.
Well, gentlemen, <i>merde</i>.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.552
And I just wanna
wish everybody good luck.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.672
-What? What did you say?
-Bite your tongue.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.155
Well, what's the matter?
All I said was "good luck."

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.432
-He said it again.
-Hasn't anyon <i>e e</i> ver told you?

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.154
<i>It's bad luck to say ''good luck''</i>

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.673
<i>And just for luck they all shout</i>

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.359
<i>-''Vaffanculo''</i>
<i>-I got it</i>

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.199
<i>Now I'll never say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.836
<i>That's the rule</i>
<i>I'm no fool</i>

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.554
<i>What do I say, I beg?</i>

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.311
<i>What you say is ''break a leg''</i>

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.919
-Break a leg?
-Yeah.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.553
-Break a leg.
-Break a leg.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.716
<i>If you're clever</i>

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.989
Good luck.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.077
<i>You'll endeav our</i>

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.309
<i>To never, never, never, never</i>
<i>Ever, ever, ever say</i>

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.080
<i>On opening night</i>

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.078
Five minutes to curtain.
Curtain going up in five minutes.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.511
I'm late. I must run!

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.956
-Break a leg!
-Break a leg!

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.512
Franz, what happened?

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.598
I broke my leg.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.509
Now we'll have to cancel the show
and giv <i>e e</i> veryone their money back.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.199
Money back?

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.515
Money back?

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.869
Money back.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.911
Don't ever say that again.
Money back?

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.758
Never.
We gotta think of something else.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.270
But Franz plays Hitler, Max,
and he has no understudy.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.153
You're right. What are we gonna do?
There must be a way out.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.920
lf I could only think of something.
Some way. Some--

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.073
Hold it. I got it.
Roger, you. You could play Hitler.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.633
You know every line in the show.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.628
I've seen you at rehearsal, always
moving your lips along with the actors.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.400
It's an embarrassing habit.
I'm trying to break myself of it.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.114
But me play Hitler? No!
There's no way I could go on tonight.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.515
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.597
I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it!

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.677
-Wow, that hurt.
-Roger.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.393
Listen to me.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.149
You can do it.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.351
You know you can do it,
and I know you can do it.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.835
You've been waiting all your lifetime
for this chance.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.554
And I'm not gonna let you
pass it up.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.998
You're going out there a silly,
hysterical, screaming queen.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.998
But you're coming back
a great big...

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.155
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.432
I've got to get into makeup.
Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.474
And, oh! My lucky
Gloria Swanson mole.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.953
Got it!

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.272
Leo, the overture.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.277
Let's go.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.028
-Max.
-What?

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.831
-Good luck, Leo.
-Good luck, Max.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.636
<i>Germany was having trouble</i>
<i>What a sad, sad story</i>

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.469
<i>Needed a new leader</i>
<i>To restore its former glory</i>

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.558
<i>Where, oh, where was he?</i>

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.797
<i>Where could that man be?</i>

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.752
<i>We looked around</i>

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.712
<i>And then we found</i>

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.469
<i>The man for you and me</i>

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.476
<i>And now it's</i>

01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:01.119
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:07.634

<i>Go into your dance</i>

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.113

<i>Don't be stupid, be a smarty</i>
<i>Come and join the Nazi Party</i>

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.872
Well, I never!
Talk about bad taste.

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.074
Come on, let's get out of here
before they kill us.

<i>Oh, it ain't no mystery</i>

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.355

<i>You know we'll be going</i>

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:20.199
<i>To war</i>

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.239
Roger!

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.598
"A satiric masterpiec <i>e.''</i>

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.389
No way out.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.832
"A surprise smash."

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.190
No way out.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.868
" It was shocking,
outrageous, insulting...

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.832
...and I loved every minute of it."

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.439
No way out!

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.437
How could this happen?

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.679
We picked the wrong play,
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.235
Where did we go right?

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.154
" Congratulations."

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.229
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking these books...

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.078
...and I'm leaving.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.840
Don't try and stop me.
I've made up my mind.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.598
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.756
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.473
I'm going to play ball with the lRS.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.477
I'm going to cooperate
with the authorities.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.319
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.317
Maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.159
Please keep in touch.
It's been very nice working with you.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.994
Leo. Leo. Leo.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.437
Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.153
Take it easy, all right?

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.555
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.988
You're acting out of panic.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.475
Give me those frigging books!
Give me!

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.593
-Give me! Give me! Give me!
-I never should've listened to you.

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.950
I was an honest man
before I met you.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.038
An honest man?
You were an honest mouse!

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.879
-Give me. Give me.
-How I hate you!

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.231
Double! Double! Double!

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.118
Fat! Fat!

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.799
I'm not that fat.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.433
Fat!

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.358
Fat!

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.712
Fatty!

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.829
Fatso!
You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.314
Give me the fat books!

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.195
-Never, never!
-Fat, fat, fatty, fat!

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.238
-Oh, Jesus!
-Give them to me!

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.555
Give me the books!

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.193
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.197
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.834
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.837
Now, that's what I call celebrating.

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.590
You. You lousy fruit.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.553
-You ruined me.
-You ungrateful breeder.

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.672
After he stepped in and saved
your little show, I cannot-- My chains!

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.792
-Leave him alone!
-My ltalian chains! My chains!

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.112
You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.470
You must die. You all must die!

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.399
What are you doing,
you neo-Nazi nitwit?

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.875
-Your show's a hit.
-Who cares?

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.752
You made a fool out of Hitler.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.076
-He didn't need our help.
-He didn't need our help.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.152
Stand still! How can I shoot you
if you keep moving?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.719
Get back here!

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.797
Under the desk! Under the desk!

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.552
-Darling, quick, back in the closet.
-Okay.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.638
This is no good.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.229
I'm not killing anybody.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.233
You must cooperate!

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.034
All right, Bialystock <i>und</i> Bloom.

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.719
Now I got you.

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.399
Say your prayers!

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.877
Remember I'd tell you
when we're in too deep?

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.798
-Yeah?
-We're in too deep.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.149
Franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.874
Oh, no, no.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.190
You snivelling cowards!

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.118
Cringing under a desk?

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.233
Clinging to life like baby butterflies.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.637
Franz Liebkind will show you
how to die like a man!

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.674
Jammed.
Boy, when things go wrong....

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.758
That's it. Next time, no author.

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.030
What are you shooting
at us for anyway?

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.753
You Teutonic twit!

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.117
Wait. Wait a minute.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.719
I just got an idea.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.115
A way to close the show.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.709
Franz, I--

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.551
-There, there.
-Where? Where?

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.752
Franz, listen to me.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.190
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.914
-Why don't you shoot the actors.
-The actors?

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.519
Yes, the actors.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.632
Everybody laughed at your
beloved Führer tonight, and why?

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.559
Because of the actors.
The actors were making fun of him.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.159
Yeah, you're right, the actors!

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.113
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:14.074
-Kill. Kill all the actors.
-I must kill all the actors.

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.669
Wait a minute!

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.912
What are you talking about?

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.759
What do you mean, " kill the actors"?
You can't kill the actors.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.190
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.311
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.988
-Here. Listen--
-Open up, it's the police!

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.031
-The police!
-The police!

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.589
Come on, boys.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.155
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party. I had nothing--

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.112
You, drop that gun.

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.839
-Ociffers!
-What's going on here?

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.439
This crazy Kraut is crackers!

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.676
He crashed in here
and crassly tried to kill us.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.952
-Oh, Roger, what alliteration.
-Thank you, darling.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.955
Okay, youse two can go.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.991
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.518
Tried to kill him, eh?

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.718
Officer O'Rourke, take this man in.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.319
Next stop, Sing Sing.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:06.196
Sing Sing?
You'll never take me alive!

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.318
-What happened?
-I broke my other leg.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.356
All right, who are you,
and why was he trying to shoot you?

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.189
I haven't the slightest idea,
Sergeant O'Toole.

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.392
The name is O'Bialystock.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.388
I was just passing by on me way
to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:39.149
...and I ducked in to see
what the hell was going on.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.036
And now I'll be on me way,
before me voice gets any higher.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.832
As we say in the old country, "Taxi!"

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.234
Hold it!

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.879
Hey, sarge, look at this.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.150
-What?
-I found these two accounting books.

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:59.514
-This one says, "Show to the lRS."
-And what's the other one say?

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.518
" Never show to the lRS."

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.314
I think the three of you
better come downtown with me.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.752
-Three?
-Yeah, you and them two books.

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.148
Mr. Bialystock?

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.511
Mr. Bloom?

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.870
Where are you?

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.709
Everyone is waiting for you
at the opening-night party.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.957
Ulla, help me.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.754
What happened to you?

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.193
I know.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.234
You hung up your coat
while you were still in it.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.840
Thank you for helping me down.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.713
What were you doing up there?

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.114
Hiding.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.548
I was hiding.

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.637
From who? From what?

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:14.955
From the police.

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.277
They were just here.
They've arrested Max.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.675
-They found the books?
-I don't know what to do.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.029
Poor Max.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.834
Maybe I should turn myself in
and go to jail with him.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.238
Well, my sweet cupcake,
I know we both love Max...

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.639
...but it seems to me
you have two choices.

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.119
Number one, you can go to jail
with Mr. Bialystock...

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.359
...for years and years and years.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.074
Or number two...

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.513
...you can take that 2 million dollars
and Ulla, and go to Rio.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.599
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.677
Oh, what should I do?

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.714
Should I go to jail or go to Rio?

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.395
Mail call.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.712
Hey, fatso.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.516
I'm not that fat!

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.312
Says you.

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.551
You got a postcard.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.711
A postcard? From where?

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.798
Brazil.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.517
Brazil.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.429
Who do I know in Brazil?

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.675
Why am I asking you?

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.075
" Dear Max, Rio is everything
you said it was and more.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.154
Ulla and I think of you
every chance we get.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.353
<i>In the morning, when we</i>
<i>have breakfast on our terrace...</i>

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.073
<i>...many different herrings.</i>

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.073
<i>In the afternoon, when we rub</i>
<i>each other's sun-drenched bodies...</i>

01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:01.150
<i>... with banana-cream coconut oil,</i>
<i>number 15.</i>

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.110
<i>And then, in the evening, when</i>
<i>we samba together in the moonlight.''</i>

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.437
<i>You'll find your happiness in Rio</i>

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.712
<i>The beaches there</i>
<i>Are strewn with pearls</i>

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:17.071
<i>The tropic breezes</i>
<i>Always blow there</i>

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:20.670
<i>And so, we hear</i>
<i>Do the girls</i>

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.271
<i>''Sorry, must run. U lla's waiting.</i>

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.393
<i>It's almost 11.</i>

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.231
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:35.558
<i>Your pal, Leo.''</i>

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.598
<i>Just like Cain and Abel</i>

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.075
<i>You pulled a sneak attack</i>

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.714
<i>I thought that we were brothers</i>

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.310
<i>Then you stabbed me in the back</i>

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.308
<i>Betrayed</i>

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.830
<i>Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed</i>

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.359
<i>Like Samson and Delilah</i>
<i>Your love began to fade</i>

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.074
<i>I'm crying in the hoosegow</i>
<i>You're in Rio getting laid</i>

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.157
<i>Betrayed</i>

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.909
<i>Let's face it, I'm betrayed</i>

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.513
<i>Boy, have I been taken</i>

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.674
<i>Oy, I'm so forsaken</i>

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.313
<i>I should have seen</i>
<i>What came to pass</i>

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.999
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>To watch my ass</i>

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.634
<i>I feel like Othello</i>
<i>Everything is lost</i>

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.034
<i>Leo is Iago</i>

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.514
<i>Max is double-crossed</i>

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.233
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.476
<i>Did I mention I'm betrayed?</i>

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.513
<i>Now I'm about to go to jail</i>
<i>There's no one who will pay my bail</i>

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.315
<i>I have no one who I can cry to</i>
<i>No one I can say goodbye to</i>

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:38.877
I'm drowning!

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.513
I'm drowning!

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.438
I'm drowning here!

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.110
I'm going down for the last time.

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.072
I can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes.

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:56.838
I see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.358
I'm running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.313
No, Rex, not on the alfalfa.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.358
And I see my mother.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.030
I see Mama standing
on the back porch...

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.993
...in a worn but clean
gingham gown.

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.272
And I hear my mama
calling out to me.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.754
Alvin!

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.837
Don't forget your chores.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.838
The wood needs a-cording
and the cows need a-milking.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.713
Alvin! Alvin!

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.428
Wait a minute.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.676
My name's not Alvin.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.956
That's not my life.

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.836
Somebody else's life
is flashing before my eyes.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.517
What the hell is that about?

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.758
I'm not a hillbilly.
I grew up in the Bronx.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.112
<i>But wait, now I remember</i>

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.595
<i>How did it begin?</i>
<i>He walked into my office</i>

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.313
<i>With his cockamamie scheme</i>

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.795
<i>You can make more money</i>
<i>With a flop than with a hit</i>

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.195
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.356
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.074
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>Goodbye, Max</i>

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.635
<i>Lord, I want that money</i>
<i>I'm back, Max</i>

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.068
<i>Come on, Leo, we can do it</i>

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.157
<i>Step one, find the play</i>

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.193
<i>See it, smell it, touch it, kiss it</i>
<i>Hello, Mr. Liebkind</i>

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.628
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.353
<i>Adolf Elizabeth Hitler?</i>

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.397
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.478
<i>Step two, hire the director</i>
<i>Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it--</i>

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.671
<i>Two, three, kick,</i>
<i>Turn, turn, turn, kick, turn</i>

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.393
<i>U lla</i>

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.832
<i>Step three, raise the money</i>

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:41.230
<i>Along came Bialy</i>

01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.635
<i>Step four, hire all the actors</i>

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.990
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>
<i>A thing of shreds and--</i>

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.191
<i>Next</i>
<i>The little wooden boy</i>

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.118
<i>Next</i>
<i>That's our Hitler</i>

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.676
<i>Break a leg</i>
<i>I broke my leg</i>

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.836
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:58.077
<i>A surprise smash</i>
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.555
<i>It'll run for years!</i>
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.398
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.232
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.032
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.674
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.279
<i>Lousy fruit</i>
<i>Kill the actors</i>

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.993
<i>You ever eat with one?</i>

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:15.033
<i>Then you ran to Rio</i>
<i>And you're safely out of reach</i>

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.514
<i>I'm behind these bars</i>

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.316
<i>You're banging U lla on the beach</i>

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.910
<i>Just like Julius Caesar</i>

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.236
<i>Was betrayed by Brutus</i>

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.631
<i>Who'd think an accountant</i>
<i>Would turn out to be my Judas</i>

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.229
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.479
<i>Is this how I'm repaid?</i>

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.557
<i>To be</i>

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:46.871
<i>Betrayed</i>

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.116
<i>Betrayed</i>

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.710
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.272
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.636
We find the defendant...

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.910
...incredibly guilty.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.150
Hold me, touch me.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.476
I'm a little busy.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.839
Does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf?

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.590
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.111
I admit, for the last 20 years
I've been a lying, double-crossing...

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.517
...two-faced, backstabbing,
despicable crook.

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.119
But I had no choice.

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:34.273
I was a Broadway producer.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.553
A man without a conscience...

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.149
...and with no one
who gave a damn about him.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.033
And that, Your Honour,
is what hurts the most.

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.195
I thought I'd at last
found a loyal partner.

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.195
A man I cared about...

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.397
...and who I thought
cared about me.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.239
What breaks my heart is now...

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.670
...when I need him most,
he's deserted me.

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:58.269
I will probably never see
or hear from him ever again.

01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.833
That's not true!

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:05.639
Order! Order in the court!

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:08.794
And stop that samba!

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.992
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom...

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.919
...Max Bialystock's partner.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.270
And who are you, my dear?

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:21.870
My name is
Ulla lnga Hansen Benson...

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.029
...Yonsen Tallen-Hallen
Svaden Svanson Bloom.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.719
Bloom?

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.388
-You're his wife?
<i>-Ja</i>, Your Honour.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.239
He wouldn't do it
unless we got married.

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.549
What a schmuck.

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.955
Now, Mr. Bloom,
why in the world would you...

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.390
...want to come back here
and give yourself up?

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.114
Why? To speak on his behalf.

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:51.750
We all know that Max Bialystock
is a lying, double-crossing...

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:56.272
...two-faced, slimy,
manipulative, underhanded--

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.993
Please...

01:51:58.480 --> 01:51:59.833
...don't help me.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.673
Your Honour-- Your honour,
if I may address the court.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.233
The law was created to protect
people from being wronged.

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:15.069
So whom has
Max Bialystock wronged?

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.192
-Well, not these dear ladies.
-No.

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.391
And not me, not--

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.711
Not me.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.156
I was this nobody.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.511
No on <i>e e</i> ver called m <i>e ''</i> Leo" before.

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:31.678
I mean, Your Honour,
I know it isn't a big legal point...

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:35.873
...but even when I was in kindergarten
everybody always called m <i>e ''</i> Bloom."

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:40.194
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that even when I was in Rio...

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.916
...and had everything
I'd ever dreamed of...

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.389
...I suddenly realized that--

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.591
That this man....

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.192
This man....

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.151
<i>No one ever made me</i>
<i>Feel like someone</i>

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:01.517
<i>Till him</i>

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:07.350
<i>Life was really nothing</i>
<i>But a glum one</i>

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:10.791
<i>Till him</i>

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:15.235
<i>My existence bordered on the tragic</i>

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:18.831
<i>Always timid</i>
<i>Never took a chance</i>

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.477
<i>Then I felt his magic</i>

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:26.071
<i>And my heart began to dance</i>

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:30.870
<i>I was always frightened</i>
<i>Fraught with worry</i>

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.270
<i>Till him</i>

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:38.750
<i>I was going nowhere in a hurry</i>

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.192
<i>Till him</i>

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:47.559
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:52.835
<i>Filled it to the brim</i>

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.910
<i>There could never</i>
<i>Ever be another one</i>

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:06.118
<i>Like him</i>

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.033
Leo....

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.673
Leo...

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.189
...I never realized.

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.115
-You're a good singer.
-Thank you.

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.438
-No, really, like a professional.
-Well, I sang it for you, Max.

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:33.518
I sang it because I'm your friend.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.233
You are?

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.033
I've had a lot of relationships...

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.196
...but you couldn't call
any of them "friend."

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.311
But come to think of it...

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.757
...no on <i>e e</i> ver, ever really knew me.

01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.236
<i>Till him</i>

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.795
<i>Everyone was always out</i>
<i>To screw me</i>

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.834
<i>Till him</i>

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.198
<i>Never met a man I ever trusted</i>

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.632
<i>Always dealt with shysters</i>
<i>In the past</i>

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:13.110
<i>Now I'm well-adjusted</i>

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:19.190
<i>'Cause I've got a friend at last</i>

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.831
Don't help me.

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.158
<i>Always playing singles</i>
<i>Never doubles</i>

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.033
<i>Till him</i>

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.278
<i>Never had a pal</i>
<i>To share my troubles</i>

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:54.917
<i>Till him</i>

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.871
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.474
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.394
<i>There could never ever be</i>

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.072
<i>Another one</i>

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:25.832
<i>Like him</i>

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.951
Gentlemen, it breaks my heart...

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.435
...to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.278
So I won't.

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:40.040
Five years in the state penitentiary
at Sing Sing.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.232
<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.830
<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.792
<i>Oh, you can lock us up</i>

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.036
<i>Und lose the key</i>

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.719
<i>But hearts in love</i>

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.194
<i>Are always free</i>

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.355
Come on, boys.

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:59.039

<i>'Cause we're still prisoners of love</i>

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.276
Congratulations.

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.957
You now own 45 percent...

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.230
...of <i>Prisoners of Love</i>. Next!

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.635
-How much have you sold so far?
-Six hundred percent.

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:21.230
ls that all? Keep selling.
Keep selling.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.753
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Quiet! Give me that.

01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.871
How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.674
No knife fights in rehearsal.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.156
Hi. What are you in for,
lack of rhythm?

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.635
Get in line.
Everybody get in line, right away!

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.990
All right, you animals,
let's take it all together!

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.873

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:56.478
-<i>Our turtledoves</i>
-Okay, just the murderers!

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.193
Hey, you.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.472
The warden wants to get in
on this thing.

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.078
Tell the warden he now owns
100 percent of <i>Prisoners of Love</i>.

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.589
-Thank you.
-Sing out, criminals.

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:11.438
Let them hear you in solitary.

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:12.914
Take it home, boys.

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.954
We open in Leavenworth
on Saturday night!

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.789
Hey, Bialystock, Bloom, Liebkind,
good news!

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.433
This just came from the governor.

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:24.790
"Gentlemen, you are hereby
granted a full pardon...

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.958
...for having, through song and dance,
brought joy and laughter...

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.869
...into the hearts of every murderer,
rapist and sex maniac in Sing Sing."

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.355
-You're free!
-Free?

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:37.154
Next stop, <i>Prisoners of Love</i>
on Broadway!

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:41.638
-Broadway!
-Adolf, you must tell the other birds.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:47.358
<i>But hearts in love</i>
<i>Are always free</i>

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.154

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.993
<i>And then you realize</i>

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.112
<i>That there is</i>

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.279
<i>Nothing like a show on Broadway</i>

02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:02.314
<i>Nothing like a Broadway show</i>

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.910
<i>Hearts will skip a beat on Broadway</i>

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.509
<i>If you're feeling blue</i>
<i>I'm telling you</i>

02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:10.517
<i>That's the place to go</i>

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.676
<i>Movies drag</i>
<i>Their endings sag</i>

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.438
<i>TV's just a bore</i>

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.517
<i>So hit the street</i>
<i>And move your feet</i>

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.153
<i>To the place we all adore</i>

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.717
<i>Because there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.674
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.518
<i>It's often been said</i>
<i>The theatre is dead</i>

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.312
<i>The critics repeat it en masse</i>

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.238
<i>But the theatre's alive</i>
<i>It's gonna survive</i>

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.953
<i>Although it's a pain in the ass</i>

02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:35.878
<i>You waited forever</i>
<i>And finally got tickets</i>

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.832
<i>To get to your seat</i>
<i>You gotta cross pickets</i>

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.758
<i>The guy to your right</i>
<i>Is frightfully tight</i>

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.110
<i>The guy to your left</i>
<i>Appears to have rickets</i>

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.117
<i>The music's yuck</i>
<i>The lyrics suck</i>

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.072
<i>The casting is all wrong</i>

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.032
<i>And when you reach the bathroom</i>

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.468
<i>The line is five miles long</i>

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.753
<i>But still there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.669
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.518
<i>You swear you'll never go again</i>

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:01.472
<i>It's simply not worthwhile</i>

02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:03.636
<i>You make that v ow</i>
<i>And then somehow</i>

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:08.152
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.432
<i>That's why there's</i>

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.315
<i>Nothing like a show</i>
<i>On Broadway</i>

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.875
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.399
<i>Till you're in movies</i>

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.639
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.799
<i>And though it is expensive</i>
<i>At a hundred bucks a throw</i>

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.514
<i>There's nothing</i>

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:36.955
<i>Like a Broadway show!</i>

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.317

<i>Sad to tell you</i>
<i>We got to go</i>

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.350
<i>Grab your hat</i>
<i>And head for the door</i>

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:21.789
<i>In case you didn't notice</i>

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.399
<i>There ain't any more</i>

<i>Keep your big mouth shut</i>

<i>We're glad you came but</i>
<i>We have to shout</i>

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:41.516
<i>Get out</i>

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.319
It's over.
