WEBVTT

00:11.242 --> 00:13.012
Looking good, doc.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.684
What, you got a hot date?

00:14.685 --> 00:16.416
You have no idea.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.017
You might want to dress down

00:18.018 --> 00:19.319
when we go into a
bad neighborhood.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.020
Oh, like I'm gonna
take fashion advice

00:21.021 --> 00:23.393
from somebody who owned
a members only tuxedo.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.425
(Chuckles)
Seriously? What color?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.127
Black. Look, I'm just sayin',

00:27.128 --> 00:28.428
you might not
want to tempt fate.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.300
Although you obviously
want to tempt me.

00:30.301 --> 00:32.632
(Scoffs) In your
dreams, Sullivan.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.734
Well, not to do your job,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.466
but I'm guessing the two
bullet holes to the chest

00:36.467 --> 00:38.808
are what killed him.

00:38.809 --> 00:41.171
What's your guess on that?

00:41.172 --> 00:44.274
Hey, hey. Let me have a look.

00:44.275 --> 00:46.716
Well, it looks like heroin.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.419
Aren't you gonna taste it
like all the cool cops do?

00:49.420 --> 00:50.750
(Chuckles) That's funny.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.582
You hear that, Tommy?
She thinks I'm cool.

00:52.583 --> 00:56.226
"Nicholas Russo,
New York, New York."

00:56.227 --> 00:57.627
Long way to come to get high.

00:57.628 --> 00:59.159
What's the name again?

00:59.160 --> 01:02.262
Russo, Nicholas, 21
years old. You know him?

01:02.263 --> 01:04.334
Well, I know his father.

01:04.335 --> 01:06.196
Daniel Russo.

01:06.197 --> 01:09.169
Runs the largest organized
crime family in New York.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.370
You think this was a mob hit?

01:10.371 --> 01:12.142
(Gunshots) Aah!

01:12.143 --> 01:13.143
Ohh!

01:13.144 --> 01:14.374
Shooter, northeast corner.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.805
You okay?

01:15.806 --> 01:17.447
No. You ruined my outfit.

01:17.448 --> 01:19.549
(Man) He's on the move!

01:19.550 --> 01:21.181
Adam!

01:21.182 --> 01:22.652
(Tires squeal)

01:22.653 --> 01:24.354
(Sirens wailing) Come on.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.156
(Groaning) Come on.

01:26.157 --> 01:27.717
6 inches, he would've
taken your head off.

01:27.718 --> 01:29.088
Gah!

01:29.089 --> 01:30.260
Any dizziness,
shortness of breath?

01:30.261 --> 01:31.222
No, no, no. I don't know.

01:31.223 --> 01:32.392
Help me get his vest off.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.863
That's all you. Thanks.

01:33.864 --> 01:35.865
Set up a perimeter.
Go door to door.

01:35.866 --> 01:38.228
Guy shoots at cops,
he doesn't get away.

01:38.229 --> 01:39.799
(Grunts) Good.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.171
(Groans)

01:41.172 --> 01:42.133
First time? Mm-hmm.

01:42.134 --> 01:43.673
Yeah. It's just hard to imagine

01:43.674 --> 01:46.636
somebody'd be stupid enough
to kill the son of a mafia Don

01:46.637 --> 01:48.478
and then stick around
to shoot at the police.

01:48.479 --> 01:49.739
One way to find out. (Groans)

01:49.740 --> 01:52.342
Match this bullet to
the two in our victim.

01:52.343 --> 01:54.114
(Sirens wailing)

01:55.286 --> 01:57.247
Our victim has two
entrance wounds

01:57.248 --> 02:00.350
closely grouped,
upper left chest.

02:00.351 --> 02:05.225
A thorough external exam
reveals no old track marks

02:05.226 --> 02:07.627
or recent injection sites.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.360
If Nick was doing heroin,
he wasn't injecting it.

02:10.361 --> 02:12.362
Well, Russo's kid was
always more of a drinker,

02:12.363 --> 02:14.133
like his dad.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.735
Although, Russo
cleaned up his act

02:15.736 --> 02:17.838
after surviving
that mob hit in '99,

02:20.211 --> 02:23.413
i-I'm kind of addicted to
the true crime channel.

02:23.414 --> 02:24.814
Why am I not surprised?

02:24.815 --> 02:27.617
Seriously, Daniel
Russo's no joke.

02:27.618 --> 02:30.450
I mean, most infamous
mob boss since gotti.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.922
I mean, he rules the
east coast with an iron fist.

02:32.923 --> 02:35.725
What's truly terrifying
about him is he's cunning.

02:35.726 --> 02:37.257
I mean, this guy
has been suspected

02:37.258 --> 02:38.388
in over a dozen murders.

02:38.389 --> 02:39.759
Hasn't spent a day in jail.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.261
Who our victim's father is

02:41.262 --> 02:44.894
doesn't affect how
we do our job, Ethan.

02:44.895 --> 02:47.837
I got a chalky white
substance in the hair.

02:47.838 --> 02:49.799
Get a sample of that.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.373
Nick? Well, Nick Russo...

02:53.374 --> 02:54.874
Is no angel either.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.846
I mean, he's like...

02:56.847 --> 02:59.249
J.f.k. Jr., but evil.

02:59.250 --> 03:03.313
Running around New York
trading on his father's name.

03:03.314 --> 03:05.315
But he didn't seem to
have his dad's knack

03:05.316 --> 03:08.259
for staying out of jail.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.960
(Man) Where's my son?

03:10.961 --> 03:12.722
(Footsteps approach)

03:12.723 --> 03:15.194
Move!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.966
You can't be in here.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.568
Get out of my way.

03:18.569 --> 03:19.829
Ethan, get security.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.200
Now!

03:21.201 --> 03:23.333
Do you know who I am?

03:23.334 --> 03:26.276
Yes, you are a father
who has lost his child.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.238
And I am very sorry,
but by being in here,

03:28.239 --> 03:29.979
you are compromising
our investigation.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.681
I'm sure you don't want that.

03:31.682 --> 03:33.613
I promise you that I
will do everything I can

03:33.614 --> 03:35.485
to bring your son's
killer to justice.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.548
Right now you have to
leave so I can do my job.

03:44.295 --> 03:45.625
(Inhales sharply)

03:45.626 --> 03:47.657
You do your job well, doctor.

03:47.658 --> 03:50.229
Because I promise you,
the next body on your table

03:50.230 --> 03:53.003
will be the man
who killed my son!

03:55.506 --> 03:59.440
♪♪♪

04:07.278 --> 04:09.279
How are my people
supposed to do their job

04:09.280 --> 04:11.421
with the threat of a mob
war hanging over their heads?

04:11.422 --> 04:12.922
I talked to the feds. They
don't think it's a mob hit.

04:12.923 --> 04:15.285
Nobody in Philly is stupid
enough to go up against Russo.

04:15.286 --> 04:16.586
Well, that doesn't
change the fact that

04:16.587 --> 04:19.258
our work in identifying
this kid's killer

04:19.259 --> 04:20.490
is gonna result
in another murder.

04:20.491 --> 04:22.792
It does lend a certain
finality to our findings.

04:22.793 --> 04:25.034
Which means we gotta
proceed with extreme caution.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.036
Russo is gonna do
everything he possibly can

04:27.037 --> 04:28.738
to get inside this case.

04:28.739 --> 04:30.900
Hell, two years ago, he went
after a witness in WITSEC.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.742
They still haven't
found the guy's head.

04:32.743 --> 04:34.344
Case information

04:34.345 --> 04:35.875
is on a need-to-know basis.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.447
We just gotta change
the way we do business.

04:37.448 --> 04:39.649
You know what I'm gonna
change because of Russo? Nothing.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.351
Okay, pretending
the threat doesn't exist

04:41.352 --> 04:42.652
is just blind stubbornness.

04:42.653 --> 04:44.554
It's like wearing
Prada to south Philly.

04:44.555 --> 04:46.015
It wasn't Prada. It was
Alexander McQueen.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.058
And do you have some
kind of history with Russo?

04:49.059 --> 04:50.760
He's a bad guy. I'm a good guy.

04:50.761 --> 04:52.692
The history is given. Uh-huh.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.364
Lab says the slug from
my vest is too damaged

04:54.365 --> 04:55.865
to be of much use ballistically.

04:55.866 --> 04:57.867
All they could tell me is
it's a 9-millimeter round.

04:57.868 --> 04:59.369
Okay, then let's go see

04:59.370 --> 05:01.070
if that matches our
bullets in the victim.

05:01.071 --> 05:05.405
Oh, yeah. Uh, no
press conferences.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.637
Thank you.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.339
Listen... (Sighs)

05:09.340 --> 05:11.381
Can you take that autopsy?

05:11.382 --> 05:12.642
Yeah, sure. Everything okay?

05:12.643 --> 05:15.015
Yeah, I just got an
appointment I forgot about.

05:26.857 --> 05:29.359
How you doin'? I'm
here to see your boss.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.630
That's not gonna happen, pal.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.931
Aah!

05:31.932 --> 05:33.364
(Grunts)

05:37.107 --> 05:39.409
Hmm.

05:39.410 --> 05:40.670
It's all right, Vincent.

05:40.671 --> 05:43.373
The detective's an old friend.

05:43.374 --> 05:45.476
Go check on Tony.

05:46.617 --> 05:50.420
My condolences, Mrs. Russo.

05:50.421 --> 05:51.551
Keep 'em.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.123
All you've ever done
is hurt my family.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.727
Well, Tommy,

05:57.728 --> 06:00.930
I heard you'd landed in Philly.

06:00.931 --> 06:04.694
Shame about what
happened in New York.

06:04.695 --> 06:06.035
If you'd only come to me,

06:06.036 --> 06:07.767
I could've made your
problems go away.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.140
So what was Nicky doing
in Philadelphia? No idea.

06:11.141 --> 06:12.672
You know they
found heroin on him.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.003
Was he selling it or using it...

06:14.004 --> 06:15.505
My Nicky never touched drugs.

06:15.506 --> 06:17.507
And don't you dare go
telling people that he did.

06:17.508 --> 06:19.749
I'm just trying to figure out
if he died for his own sins

06:19.750 --> 06:21.050
or the sins of the father.

06:21.051 --> 06:23.684
Ev, why don't you
give us a minute?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.418
Please.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.861
(Scoffs)

06:36.697 --> 06:41.030
You would be wise
to show some respect.

06:41.031 --> 06:44.774
You'd be wise not to make
threats in my town, Russo.

06:44.775 --> 06:47.106
You so much as
look at a suspect,

06:47.107 --> 06:48.878
I'm gonna plant
you in an 8-foot cell

06:48.879 --> 06:51.512
till they take you
out in a 6-foot box.

06:55.486 --> 06:58.849
You've never been
able to do it before.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.851
Get out of my city...

07:01.852 --> 07:04.024
Before you get hurt.

07:05.856 --> 07:08.928
(Megan) Nick Russo was
dead before he hit the ground.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.662
Both bullets
penetrated his left chest,

07:12.663 --> 07:14.604
anterior to posterior,

07:14.605 --> 07:17.436
through the upper
lobe of the left lung

07:17.437 --> 07:21.210
and perforating the
left ventricle of the heart.

07:21.211 --> 07:24.143
X-rays show that both
bullets came to rest

07:24.144 --> 07:27.176
in the posterior portion
of the same lobe.

07:27.177 --> 07:29.719
You think Nick ever had a chance

07:29.720 --> 07:31.521
of a life of his own?

07:31.522 --> 07:34.083
Ethan, if you subject me

07:34.084 --> 07:36.756
to a nature versus
nurture conversation,

07:36.757 --> 07:39.228
I will have your head laminated.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.760
I'm just saying, you know,

07:40.761 --> 07:42.131
a kid growing
up in that world...

07:42.132 --> 07:44.133
How can he ever
hope to escape it?

07:44.134 --> 07:45.635
Plenty of kids grow
up in bad situations.

07:45.636 --> 07:48.769
They don't all
become their fathers.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.673
Wow.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.045
Look at those granulomas.

07:56.046 --> 07:59.779
Either Nick had
some kind of infection,

07:59.780 --> 08:03.153
or he inhaled a
pretty serious irritant.

08:08.519 --> 08:10.790
Get this to the lab. Now.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.123
You got it.

08:18.168 --> 08:20.099
Huh.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.833
Ballistics will have
to confirm, but...

08:23.834 --> 08:27.006
That looks like a
9-millimeter projectile to me.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.137
Which means
there's a good chance

08:28.138 --> 08:30.880
the guy who shot
Nick also shot me.

08:30.881 --> 08:32.582
Daniel Russo walked into autopsy

08:32.583 --> 08:34.083
and threatened my people.

08:34.084 --> 08:35.745
I need to make sure
they're protected.

08:35.746 --> 08:37.617
(Curtis) Ooh.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.148
You gotta see this.

08:39.149 --> 08:41.220
W-w... let me call
you back, all right?

08:41.221 --> 08:43.252
What?

08:43.253 --> 08:44.625
I was on the Internet.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.026
Doing research.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.257
Mm.

08:48.258 --> 08:50.099
There's a video that was
just uploaded on YouTube.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.032
It's gone viral.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.236
Can you believe
the balls on this fool,

08:57.237 --> 08:59.739
to film himself
shooting at cops?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.773
(Gunshots)

09:09.249 --> 09:11.320
Think you can pull
a fingerprint off that?

09:11.321 --> 09:14.024
I can damn sure try.

09:16.587 --> 09:18.127
Hey, remember me?

09:18.128 --> 09:20.760
No. We go to school
together or something?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.692
He's the cop you shot.

09:22.693 --> 09:23.863
Look, I was high.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.765
I do a lot of stupid
stuff when I'm high.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.096
Well, you know what?

09:27.097 --> 09:28.798
In that case, then you can
go. No hard feelings, huh?

09:28.799 --> 09:29.999
For reals?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.170
No! You shot a cop.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.772
You're going to jail
for attempted murder.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.144
And once we match the
bullet from my vest to our victim,

09:35.145 --> 09:37.146
then we add on
first-degree murder.

09:37.147 --> 09:38.778
I didn't kill no one.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.310
Do you recognize this? We
found it in the pocket of our victim.

09:41.311 --> 09:43.012
No.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.313
That's funny, 'cause we
found one exactly like it

09:44.314 --> 09:45.785
in your apartment.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.156
Which strongly implies that
you murdered Nick Russo

09:47.157 --> 09:48.688
in a drug deal gone wrong.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.820
I don't know no Nick
Russo, and I don't sell drugs.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.922
I'm purely a consumer.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.824
I mean, he must have
bought it on the street like I did.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.896
You guys really think that
I'm dumb enough to kill a guy

09:56.897 --> 09:58.868
and then stick around to
shoot up the crime scene?

09:58.869 --> 10:00.229
(Tommy and Adam) Yes.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.101
Look, I can help you here.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.273
I didn't kill this Nick guy, but
I heard the murder happen.

10:04.274 --> 10:05.635
Oh, you heard it?

10:05.636 --> 10:07.006
Hand to god.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.207
I was up on the roof
smoking a speed boat

10:08.208 --> 10:11.180
when I hear two shots,
then a car peals out.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.142
Sounded like it hit something
on the way out of the alley.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.114
By the time I manage my
ass over to the edge of the roof,

10:15.115 --> 10:16.285
the car was gone.

10:16.286 --> 10:17.717
Dead guy was lying there.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.689
So you thought, let
me just hang around

10:19.690 --> 10:23.252
and film myself
shooting at cops?

10:23.253 --> 10:26.126
I was really stoned.

10:27.658 --> 10:29.799
It's the truth. Check the alley.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.262
That car definitely
hit something.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.364
All right, book him
for attempted murder.

10:35.365 --> 10:38.138
Make sure his name doesn't
show up in the system.

10:41.271 --> 10:44.043
So... did you wring a
confession out of him?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.274
No.

10:45.275 --> 10:47.246
I just find it hard to imagine

10:47.247 --> 10:48.778
that a guy like
Nick could've let

10:48.779 --> 10:50.179
some knucklehead like
that get the jump on him.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.852
C.s.u.'s gonna check out the
story. What brings you here?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.383
Test results came
back on that substance

10:54.384 --> 10:57.727
I took out of Nick's hair...
Magnesium carbonate.

10:57.728 --> 11:00.189
It's a filler used
in things like chalk,

11:00.190 --> 11:02.391
fireproofing, and laxatives.

11:02.392 --> 11:04.033
Laxatives?

11:04.034 --> 11:07.036
Dealers use laxatives to step
on their product all the time.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.197
Exactly.

11:08.198 --> 11:10.169
And since his tox screen
came back negative,

11:10.170 --> 11:13.202
we can assume that the heroin
in his pocket was a sample.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.244
You know, you could've
just called with this.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.776
I know.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.277
I just wanted to see you.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.709
Really? No.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.380
Is he always this gullible?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.083
Oh, heads up. (Clears throat)

11:24.084 --> 11:25.254
Who's the suit?

11:25.255 --> 11:27.256
Philly's top defense attorney.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.158
Dr. Hunt.

11:29.159 --> 11:30.419
Counselor.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.821
Detective Sullivan?

11:31.822 --> 11:33.122
That's me.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.265
I'm Martin Davis,
Daniel Russo's lawyer.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.767
Ah.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.268
I understand that an
arrest has been made

11:39.269 --> 11:40.730
in his son's murder.

11:40.731 --> 11:43.833
I'm unable to comment
on an ongoing investigation.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.474
You might want to be a bit
more cooperative, detective,

11:45.475 --> 11:47.206
given your actions
of earlier today.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.938
(Chuckles) I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.709
You assaulted
Mr. Russo's driver.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.712
You threatened my client
in the midst of his grief.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.245
Oh, we were just
catching up on old times.

11:56.246 --> 11:57.446
(Chuckles) Really?

11:57.447 --> 11:59.118
Any further "catching
up" will be met

11:59.119 --> 12:01.151
with overwhelming legal action.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.294
Heard you took a bullet
last night, detective.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.455
Yeah.

12:06.456 --> 12:07.827
Glad to see you're okay.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.458
Thank you. Doctor,
always a pleasure.

12:09.459 --> 12:10.830
Mm-hmm.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.132
Detective.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.037
You went after
Russo? Without me?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.869
He fired a warning shot across
Megan's bow. (Cell phone rings)

12:19.870 --> 12:21.771
I had to fire back. (Beeps)

12:21.772 --> 12:23.272
Hey, I'm a big girl. I
can fire my own shots.

12:23.273 --> 12:24.443
Not with a guy like Russo.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.015
With any man.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.177
C.s.u. Found paint transfer

12:28.178 --> 12:29.849
on a dented dumpster
at the end of the alley.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.851
The transfer was fresh.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.184
Maybe Jaxon's telling the truth.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.228
(Sighs) So if Jaxon
didn't kill Nick, who did?

12:39.229 --> 12:41.130
Somebody brave enough

12:41.131 --> 12:43.793
or desperate enough to risk
being taken out by Russo.

12:43.794 --> 12:46.765
Yo, can I get a
soda or something?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.268
Juice box?

12:50.841 --> 12:52.202
(Gunfire)

12:54.004 --> 12:58.148
(Tires squealing)

13:02.853 --> 13:05.014
(Tommy) Shots fired, gray sedan

13:05.015 --> 13:06.185
heading north from the station.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.458
License plates...
X-ray-Tom-Tom-4-8-4.

13:09.459 --> 13:13.062
(Megan panting) (Sirens wailing)

13:13.063 --> 13:14.894
(Sighs)

13:14.895 --> 13:17.898
(Continues panting)

13:47.057 --> 13:48.827
You can't blame yourself.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.901
I don't. I blame Daniel Russo.

13:51.902 --> 13:55.464
In his mind, he was
avenging his son.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.967
This boy was
somebody's son, too.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.870
I'm not saying he was right.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.073
You know, proving Russo
did it is not gonna be easy.

14:04.074 --> 14:07.147
The man's managed to get
away with murder for decades.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.921
He's not getting
away with this one.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.923
Wh-what are you doing? Megan?

14:13.924 --> 14:17.856
Wait. Where are you going?
What about the autopsy?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.128
You know, Russo, the
man you gunned down

14:19.129 --> 14:20.329
didn't even kill Nick.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.291
So now instead of
hunting for the guy who did,

14:22.292 --> 14:25.094
I gotta deal with this
old-testament stupidity.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.395
My client had nothing to do

14:26.396 --> 14:28.397
with the unfortunate
demise of Mr. Ware.

14:28.398 --> 14:30.569
And he absolutely denies

14:30.570 --> 14:32.401
making any kind of a
threat in front of Dr. Hunt.

14:32.402 --> 14:33.973
Oh, he does, does he?

14:33.974 --> 14:36.475
That's 'cause he's
a coward and a liar.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.447
Mm.

14:38.448 --> 14:40.409
It's Adam, isn't it?

14:40.410 --> 14:42.251
Mm-hmm.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.013
Let me tell you
a little something

14:44.014 --> 14:45.214
about your partner.

14:45.215 --> 14:48.217
He is a man of
questionable moral character.

14:48.218 --> 14:51.591
It's why he had
to leave New York.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.025
He didn't tell you.

14:56.026 --> 14:58.897
He didn't share his sins

14:58.898 --> 15:02.032
that got him excommunicated
from the NYPD.

15:04.174 --> 15:06.976
You know, you should worry
about your own sins, Mr. Russo,

15:06.977 --> 15:09.378
because knowing my
partner the way I do,

15:09.379 --> 15:11.111
he will Bury you for them.

15:13.283 --> 15:15.084
I like your son.

15:15.085 --> 15:16.915
He plays hardball like you do.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.388
W-Wait, wait a minute here.

15:19.389 --> 15:21.320
This is your dad?

15:21.321 --> 15:24.053
How stupid can you get?

15:24.054 --> 15:25.194
That boy did not kill your son.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.525
You want us to find his killer,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.357
you can't go executing
every person we talk to!

15:28.358 --> 15:30.159
Watch yourself, doctor.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.500
Why, is he gonna shoot me, too?

15:31.501 --> 15:34.063
Megan. Come on.

15:34.064 --> 15:36.305
(Door closes)

15:36.306 --> 15:38.167
What the hell are you doing?

15:38.168 --> 15:39.969
You can't talk to Russo
like that. He'll kill you.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.140
Oh, but it's okay for you to?

15:41.141 --> 15:42.311
Yeah.

15:42.312 --> 15:43.472
What's the difference?

15:43.473 --> 15:44.713
Because I'm a cop. I got a gun.

15:44.714 --> 15:46.114
I got nobody at
home waiting for me.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.019
I need you to stay objective.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.720
It's the only way we
can bring this guy down.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.253
And there they walk.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.726
We don't have
anything to hold him on.

15:57.727 --> 15:59.688
You gotta find something!

15:59.689 --> 16:02.531
I've been watching this
guy walk out of rooms

16:02.532 --> 16:04.463
for 20 years.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.964
I need your help, Megan.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.398
Otherwise, this guy gets
away with murder again.

16:09.399 --> 16:10.739
(Door opens)

16:10.740 --> 16:13.042
The results came back
on the black paint transfer

16:13.043 --> 16:15.304
c.s.u. Found on the dumpster
in the alley where Nick was killed.

16:15.305 --> 16:18.007
It's unique to late-model
black escalades.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.008
They're everywhere.

16:19.009 --> 16:20.379
Yeah, but only one
registered owner

16:20.380 --> 16:22.051
made a call last week
to a New York number

16:22.052 --> 16:24.013
belonging to Nick Russo.

16:24.014 --> 16:27.216
I, uh, I put in a phone record
request for Nick yesterday.

16:27.217 --> 16:29.158
When they ran it against
registered owners,

16:29.159 --> 16:31.390
this guy popped up. His
name's Michael Avery.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.122
He's got a pretty
serious record,

16:33.123 --> 16:35.294
although he seems to have
turned his life around recently.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.625
He, uh, he opened
up a boxing gym,

16:36.626 --> 16:38.227
works with former gang members.

16:38.228 --> 16:39.728
What's his connection to Nick?

16:39.729 --> 16:40.769
Unknown.

16:40.770 --> 16:42.031
Anybody else know about this?

16:42.032 --> 16:43.202
No.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.373
Well, let's keep it that way

16:44.374 --> 16:45.604
before Russo adds
to the body count.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.676
(Exhales)

16:53.713 --> 16:57.316
(Tommy) Okay, let
me get this straight.

16:57.317 --> 17:01.090
Your dad is representing
the father of our victim,

17:01.091 --> 17:02.221
one of the most
notorious gangsters

17:02.222 --> 17:03.722
of the past decade,

17:03.723 --> 17:05.754
and this isn't information
you think I need to know?

17:05.755 --> 17:07.356
I wanted to tell you. I tried.

17:07.357 --> 17:08.697
I couldn't find
the right moment.

17:08.698 --> 17:10.799
Well, there wasn't a
wrong moment. (Chuckles)

17:10.800 --> 17:12.161
You have to understand.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.233
My father sets
criminals free for a living.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.166
Those are the guys that
we risk our lives to catch.

17:17.167 --> 17:18.807
If the other cops find out,

17:18.808 --> 17:21.340
my career is over
before it starts.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.671
That explains
the different name.

17:22.672 --> 17:24.173
Where'd Lucas come from?

17:24.174 --> 17:26.175
It's my mom's. I used it
when I joined the academy.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.677
My dad and I have,
uh, an understanding.

17:28.678 --> 17:33.182
Business is business,
family's family.

17:33.183 --> 17:35.154
Listen, I'm sorry. I
should've told you.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.086
Okay?

17:37.087 --> 17:38.487
You just should've
trusted me, Adam.

17:38.488 --> 17:39.828
I'm old-school.

17:39.829 --> 17:42.131
You trust your partner,
you tell 'em everything.

17:42.132 --> 17:44.233
Then why'd you lie
about going after Russo?

17:44.234 --> 17:45.334
That wasn't your fight.

17:45.335 --> 17:46.835
So he was telling the truth

17:46.836 --> 17:48.837
about something bad going
down with you in New York?

17:48.838 --> 17:51.400
Yeah.

17:51.401 --> 17:54.103
What'd you do?

17:54.104 --> 17:55.844
Just got a little overzealous.

17:55.845 --> 17:57.406
Overzealous, what
does that mean?

17:57.407 --> 17:59.108
I lost my temper,

17:59.109 --> 18:01.680
and some people
ended up in the hospital.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.612
How many people?

18:03.613 --> 18:05.214
(Chuckles) I came to Philly

18:05.215 --> 18:07.085
so I could put all
that behind me.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.359
All you need to know is,
it's not gonna happen again.

18:13.363 --> 18:14.663
(Man) Ah, see?

18:14.664 --> 18:15.794
That right's a
sledgehammer, right?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.566
But you gotta set
it up with that jab.

18:17.567 --> 18:18.867
Pop, pop, pop,
pop, and then boom!

18:18.868 --> 18:21.700
Yeah, yeah. Drop
that hammer on him.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.133
Michael Avery.

18:24.134 --> 18:26.705
Hey, Philly p.D.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.707
Been expecting you guys.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.310
Well, your boxing team got
their asses handed to 'em

18:31.311 --> 18:32.781
by the fire department.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.713
I expected you guys to
be showing up for lessons

18:34.714 --> 18:35.844
at some point.

18:35.845 --> 18:37.446
We're not here for lessons.

18:37.447 --> 18:40.149
We're here to talk about your
relationship with Nick Russo.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.151
Uh, well, there's
nothing to talk about.

18:42.152 --> 18:43.592
I've never even met the guy.

18:43.593 --> 18:45.123
Tragedy what happened, though.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.256
You're lying.

18:47.257 --> 18:49.858
This magnesium carbonate?

18:49.859 --> 18:52.361
They found traces
of it in Nicky's hair,

18:52.362 --> 18:56.305
which means he was
in this gym yesterday.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.766
So either you start
telling us the truth

18:57.767 --> 19:00.270
or we're gonna drag you
outta here in handcuffs.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.877
Look... (Sighs)

19:09.349 --> 19:11.180
I only lied to protect myself.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.521
Oh, yeah? From who?

19:12.522 --> 19:13.722
Daniel Russo.

19:13.723 --> 19:15.324
Oh, he... He wouldn't like it

19:15.325 --> 19:16.825
if he found out that Nick

19:16.826 --> 19:18.287
was talking to me about
getting out of the life.

19:18.288 --> 19:19.788
Guys like Nicky
don't get out of the life.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.159
Most don't.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.631
You're right.

19:22.632 --> 19:25.364
Nick had heard I'd had some
luck in helping others find a path.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.836
So he got my number from
a mutual friend in New York,

19:27.837 --> 19:29.238
called, and asked me

19:29.239 --> 19:30.769
if I'd help him get out
of the family business.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.641
If he was so intent on
turning his life around,

19:32.642 --> 19:34.603
why'd we find
heroin in his pocket?

19:34.604 --> 19:36.775
Because people are complicated.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.847
Just wanting to be clean
doesn't make you clean, right?

19:38.848 --> 19:40.679
Honestly... After we talked,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.681
I didn't think he was gonna
actually go through with it.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.585
I mean, he was
definitely his father's son.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.817
We got a warrant

19:48.818 --> 19:50.188
to search your escalade.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.490
Anything you want to
tell us before we do?

19:51.491 --> 19:52.661
Yeah, like maybe
you were in the alley

19:52.662 --> 19:53.822
the night Nick was killed.

19:53.823 --> 19:56.295
I was right here. So was my car.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.367
It's parked out back.

Check it out for yourself.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.012

happened to Nicky, though.

20:09.579 --> 20:10.879
Let's go.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.781
(Ethan) On some level,
you have to respect the code

20:12.782 --> 20:14.783
that Russo lives under.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.715
You know, eye for an eye?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.917
What would you do if
something happened to Lacey?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.289
I-I'm sorry.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.820
Russo is not a rock star, Ethan.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.422
He's a murderer.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.924
You do his victims a disservice
when you mythologize him!

20:25.925 --> 20:27.627
(Gloves snap)

20:31.631 --> 20:33.402
Everything all right?

20:33.403 --> 20:35.664
Autopsy was a bust.

20:35.665 --> 20:37.566
So was Michael Avery.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.238
Escalade was immaculate.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.273

you pulled with Russo today,

you a lesson in respect.

drive him downtown

26:04.163 --> 26:05.794

26:05.795 --> 26:07.065
I was supposed
to fly it to New York

26:07.066 --> 26:08.797

so you couldn't go to the police.

26:11.841 --> 26:12.971
What was I supposed to do?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.272
He would've killed
me if I refused.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.644

on him in the alley.

26:21.350 --> 26:22.911
You take off and you clip
the dumpster on your way out.

26:22.912 --> 26:24.252
That's not how it happened.

26:24.253 --> 26:26.214

wait for his supplier.

one car on the scene.

what happened.

26:43.873 --> 26:45.333

Someone else did.

26:45.334 --> 26:46.875
Look what I found
in the dumpster

26:46.876 --> 26:48.276

26:48.277 --> 26:49.708
The murder weapon.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.239

27:02.321 --> 27:04.022
he will kill him,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.323
either on the street or in jail.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.055
Oh, he's not going to jail.

house where Adam and I

autopsy was first rate,

28:26.836 --> 28:29.107
let alone represent him.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.439
Everyone deserves
a lawyer, Adam.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.981
It's in the constitution.

28:32.982 --> 28:35.884
Is helping him whack
someone in there as well?

28:35.885 --> 28:37.215
What are you saying?

28:37.216 --> 28:38.747
You were at the precinct

28:38.748 --> 28:40.418
right before Jaxon
ware was killed.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.720
You knew we had
a suspect in custody.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.022
20 minutes later,

28:44.023 --> 28:47.495
Russo gunned him
down in the street.

28:47.496 --> 28:49.958
And you think I had
something to do with that?

28:49.959 --> 28:51.499
I don't know what to think, dad.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.032
It's a hell of a
coincidence, though, huh?

28:54.033 --> 28:56.965
I know you don't
respect what I do.

28:56.966 --> 28:58.306
But I have never broken the law

28:58.307 --> 28:59.968
doing my job,

28:59.969 --> 29:01.339
and I never will.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.012
And the fact that
you don't know that

29:04.013 --> 29:05.513
breaks my heart.

29:05.514 --> 29:08.346
(Sighs)

29:08.347 --> 29:11.279
(Exhales) I gotta hit the head.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.152
♪ And the rain came down ♪

29:14.153 --> 29:16.985
♪ all around ♪

29:16.986 --> 29:19.058
(Chimes)

29:38.347 --> 29:41.249
Tommy, stay away
from the windows.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.011
You're gonna get yourself shot

29:43.012 --> 29:44.182
if you're not careful.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.014
Only if your dad took the bait.

29:46.015 --> 29:47.385
I put the phone
where he could see it.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.887
But you're hoping
he didn't look.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.288
Just shut up and eat your pizza.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.560
Nick would always complain
about his father in prison,

29:52.561 --> 29:54.422
how domineering he was.

29:54.423 --> 29:57.466
Sounded a little
bit like you, actually.

29:58.527 --> 30:00.068
What makes you think

30:00.069 --> 30:02.000
that Russo's gonna
do the job himself?

30:02.001 --> 30:04.372
Ah, he's old-school.
He's got a code.

30:04.373 --> 30:05.533
Somebody messes
with your family,

30:05.534 --> 30:07.336
you're honor bound
to handle it yourself.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.013
(Man) A car just
turned on to the street.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.244
It's driving slow.

30:16.245 --> 30:18.847
Okay, everybody on your toes.

30:18.848 --> 30:20.588
Be ready for anything.
This car could be a diversion.

30:20.589 --> 30:21.891
(Man) 10-4.

30:40.169 --> 30:41.469
What's going on out there?

30:41.470 --> 30:44.242
(Man) The car's just
sitting. You want us to move?

30:44.243 --> 30:45.843
No, I need him to
come to the door

30:45.844 --> 30:47.345
for there to be intent.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.846
Anything out back?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.348
(Man) Negative. All quiet.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.449
I don't like this.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.921
You don't like this?

30:52.922 --> 30:55.284
(Man) Wait. Door's opening.

30:58.087 --> 31:00.088
It's Russo.

31:00.089 --> 31:02.361
He's getting out of the car.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.095
Sorry, kid.

31:07.296 --> 31:08.636
Holy god. You gotta
get me outta here.

31:08.637 --> 31:10.038
Just calm down.

31:10.039 --> 31:13.042
(Dog barking in distance)

31:16.345 --> 31:18.506
(Man) Here he comes.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.248
Hold on. Wait for my signal.

31:20.249 --> 31:21.310
(Man) Copy.

31:26.115 --> 31:29.187
(Man) He's going for a gun.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.190
Move. 10-4.

31:32.321 --> 31:33.422
Police! Get your hands up!

31:34.663 --> 31:37.325
(Chuckles) Nice, Tommy.

31:37.326 --> 31:38.466
What's this?

31:38.467 --> 31:41.169
25 to life, conspiracy,
attempted murder.

31:41.170 --> 31:43.031
Yeah, of who, with what?

31:43.032 --> 31:44.202
Where's your gun?

31:44.203 --> 31:45.633
Don't have one.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.135
Check the car.

31:47.136 --> 31:48.476
Yeah, boys. Check the car.

31:48.477 --> 31:52.210
It's clean.

31:52.211 --> 31:55.083
Now you gonna tell me
what the hell's going on here?

31:55.084 --> 31:56.544
You first.

31:56.545 --> 31:59.047
Someone slipped a note
under my hotel room door,

31:59.048 --> 32:00.488
said a person at this address

32:00.489 --> 32:02.390
had information
about my son's killer.

32:02.391 --> 32:05.053
I'm guessing that was you...

32:05.054 --> 32:06.354
To set me up.

32:06.355 --> 32:09.027
Clear case of entrapment, Tommy.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.129
Hey, Adam.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.462
Your daddy's gonna
have a field day with this.

32:14.463 --> 32:16.304
We didn't send you any note.

32:16.305 --> 32:18.466
I don't think it even exists.
Maybe you can show it to me.

32:18.467 --> 32:20.008
Well, I threw it away.

32:20.009 --> 32:21.339
But feel free to come over

32:21.340 --> 32:23.441
and dig through
the hotel garbage.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.043
Who knows?

32:25.044 --> 32:27.315
Maybe you'll find your
reputation while you're looking.

32:27.316 --> 32:31.650
That's right! Huh,
Tommy?! Tommy! Tommy!

32:36.185 --> 32:37.325
(Curtis) Ballistics just came in

32:37.326 --> 32:39.027
on the gun found
in caine's dumpster.

32:39.028 --> 32:41.389
It's a match to the bullets
you took out of Nick Russo.

32:41.390 --> 32:42.361
Good.

32:42.362 --> 32:43.731
And it gets better.

32:43.732 --> 32:45.433
A swab taken from the gunsight

32:45.434 --> 32:47.035
had a trace
amount of blood in it.

32:47.036 --> 32:48.366
Now it was partly denatured

32:48.367 --> 32:49.967
by the heat of the
gun being fired,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.439
but I ran a d.N.A.
Profile anyway.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.541
Found that seven of
the polymorphic markers

32:53.542 --> 32:55.273
were a match for Nick Russo.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.105
And that's as good
as we're gonna get

32:57.106 --> 32:58.646
given the condition
of the sample.

32:58.647 --> 33:00.409
Let me see that.

33:08.717 --> 33:10.718
The blood on the
gun's not Nick's.

33:10.719 --> 33:12.720
What? But it's a match.

33:12.721 --> 33:14.462
No, it's not.

33:14.463 --> 33:16.464
The blood was cooked
when the gun was fired,

33:16.465 --> 33:19.127
which means the blood was
on the gun before it went off.

33:19.128 --> 33:20.768
I have been over
Nick Russo's body

33:20.769 --> 33:22.570
three times with a
magnifying glass.

33:22.571 --> 33:23.771
And other than
these two bullet holes,

33:23.772 --> 33:26.474
there is no sign of
trauma, not a scratch.

33:26.475 --> 33:29.077
So the blood
belongs to the killer.

33:29.078 --> 33:31.439
But caine's blood
wouldn't be a match.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.111
Exactly, because
caine's not the killer.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.413
The only way you get
that close a d.N.A. Match

33:35.414 --> 33:38.286
is a first-degree relative.

33:38.287 --> 33:42.090
But that means
that the killer is...

33:42.091 --> 33:44.222
Nick's father...

33:44.223 --> 33:51.029
Daniel Russo.

33:55.104 --> 33:57.106
(Elevator bell dings)

33:59.338 --> 34:00.438
Not now, dad.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.569
I know what you
did back at the bar.

34:01.570 --> 34:04.041
I'm not stupid. You set me up...

34:04.042 --> 34:05.743
Your own father.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.145
How could you
think so little of me?

34:07.146 --> 34:09.147
Russo showed up at
the safe house, didn't he?

34:09.148 --> 34:10.448
I don't know
anything about that.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.619
Save it for the court, dad.

34:11.620 --> 34:13.151
No, no.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.452
I would never do anything

34:14.453 --> 34:16.784
to put you in harm's way.

34:16.785 --> 34:18.526
You think a
client... Any client...

34:18.527 --> 34:20.658
Means more to me than you?

34:20.659 --> 34:22.790
I love you, Adam.

34:22.791 --> 34:26.135
And I will keep telling
you that till you believe me.

34:28.337 --> 34:30.698
If you didn't tell Russo
about the safe house,

34:30.699 --> 34:31.839
who did?

34:31.840 --> 34:34.542
I don't know.

34:34.543 --> 34:38.647
But I would never
betray you like that.

34:41.550 --> 34:44.183
I gotta go. I gotta...

34:46.285 --> 34:47.615
You're telling me
that Russo's blood

34:47.616 --> 34:49.157
is on the murder weapon?

34:49.158 --> 34:50.788
That would be the
best present ever.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.720
We can't say for sure
without a sample of his d.N.A.

34:52.721 --> 34:54.722
Which we don't have
because someone

34:54.723 --> 34:57.395
never managed to arrest him.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.696
Ouch.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.128
All right, I'm sorry.

35:00.129 --> 35:01.729
But I'm having a hard
time with the whole idea

35:01.730 --> 35:03.231
that Russo's threat
was just an act

35:03.232 --> 35:04.732
to draw attention
away from his own guilt.

35:04.733 --> 35:07.135
It wasn't all an act. I've
seen a lot of grieving parents.

35:07.136 --> 35:09.177
His pain was real.
You can't fake that.

35:09.178 --> 35:11.108
(Elevator bell dings)
Which is why killing his son

35:11.109 --> 35:12.340
wasn't something
that he wanted to do.

35:12.341 --> 35:13.641
It was something
that he had to do.

35:13.642 --> 35:17.114
Why would a father kill a
child that he clearly loved?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.747
The discovery that his son
was planning on betraying him.

35:19.748 --> 35:21.649
That's why Nick needed caine...

35:21.650 --> 35:24.853
To move product for him
after he took his father out.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.428
Move.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.729
We got a warrant.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.201
May I see the warrant?

35:33.202 --> 35:36.165
(Paper rustles)

35:37.366 --> 35:38.636
It's legitimate, Dan.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.368
They're gonna take a
d.N.A. Sample from you.

35:40.369 --> 35:43.211
Why? What the
hell is this about?

35:43.212 --> 35:45.173
Should I tell her,
Russo, or do you wanna?

35:45.174 --> 35:46.374
(Sets down glass)

35:46.375 --> 35:47.875
Don't worry about it, ev.

35:47.876 --> 35:50.218
It's just another one of
Tommy's pathetic attempts

35:50.219 --> 35:52.180
to railroad me.

35:52.181 --> 35:55.152
Open your mouth, please.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.925
Yeah.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.332
What the hell are you doing?

36:04.333 --> 36:05.563
What you told me to do

36:05.564 --> 36:07.935
as you stood over
your dead son's body...

36:07.936 --> 36:09.738
My job.

36:13.942 --> 36:16.944
That's from the sight
of the gun, isn't it?

36:16.945 --> 36:18.676
(Glove snaps) Nick's gun.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.808
What does she mean, Nick's gun?

36:20.809 --> 36:22.310
Don't listen to this, ev.

36:22.311 --> 36:25.213
Nick was shot with his own gun.

36:25.214 --> 36:27.385
He went to the alley to
pick up a shipment of heroin

36:27.386 --> 36:29.857
for David caine
to fly to New York.

36:29.858 --> 36:32.390
But the drugs didn't
show up. His father did.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.222
(Megan) You found out he was
going into business for himself,

36:34.223 --> 36:35.623
so you confronted him.

36:35.624 --> 36:37.365
He pulled a gun,
you took it from him,

36:37.366 --> 36:38.766
cut your hand in the process.

36:38.767 --> 36:41.229
Did you hesitate at all before
you murdered your son?

36:41.230 --> 36:42.930
Or was it just business?

36:42.931 --> 36:46.234
(Ev) Danny, is that true?

36:46.235 --> 36:48.276
You killed Nicky?

36:48.277 --> 36:49.807
How could you?

36:49.808 --> 36:51.739
He was our son.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.311
Not another word.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.882
Daniel Russo,

36:54.883 --> 36:57.715
you're under arrest for the
murder of Nicholas Russo.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.216
(Handcuffs click)

36:59.217 --> 37:00.288
Anything you say can
and will be held against you

37:00.289 --> 37:01.449
in a court of law.

37:01.450 --> 37:02.950
You have a right to
an attorney. (Click)

37:02.951 --> 37:04.622
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided to you.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.023
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

37:12.331 --> 37:14.503
(Exhales deeply)

37:24.973 --> 37:26.945
(Knocks)

37:33.482 --> 37:35.022
I, uh... (Mutters)

37:35.023 --> 37:37.956
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.

37:39.928 --> 37:41.889
For what?

37:41.890 --> 37:43.761
For the other night.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.293
For 20 years ago.

37:45.294 --> 37:48.666
You... you deserved better.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.999
You know what I
don't understand?

37:52.000 --> 37:55.543
What's that?

37:55.544 --> 37:58.806
If Adam's father didn't tell
Russo about the safe house,

37:58.807 --> 38:00.779
who did?

38:02.611 --> 38:05.313
Whoever put the note
under Russo's door.

38:05.314 --> 38:07.885
Adam went through
the hotel garbage.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.319
He was up all
night, but he found it.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.461
Russo was telling the truth?

38:13.462 --> 38:14.822
So was Adam's dad.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.324
Then who wrote this?

38:16.325 --> 38:18.867
I got an idea. Want
to go for a ride?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.600
I promise I won't
try to feed you.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.903
(Sighs)

38:26.505 --> 38:29.838
♪♪♪

38:36.345 --> 38:40.618
You got a pretty
popular gym, Avery,

38:40.619 --> 38:42.920
especially with some of the
bent cops from my precinct.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.524
Cops who could've let slip
the address of a certain...

38:46.525 --> 38:47.895
Safe house?

38:47.896 --> 38:49.897
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:49.898 --> 38:51.929
Mm. He doesn't know
anything about that.

38:51.930 --> 38:56.033
Then he won't know...
Anything about this.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.565
And you think he would,

38:57.566 --> 38:58.906
because most of the drug dealers

38:58.907 --> 39:01.569
who sell these little blue
packets work out here.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.040
Well, my doors are
open to all, detective...

39:03.041 --> 39:04.612
Angels and demons.

39:04.613 --> 39:06.874
Yeah, i'm... sure they are.

39:06.875 --> 39:10.948
Although it's... it's clear
you favor the demons,

39:10.949 --> 39:12.620
like Nicky Russo.

39:12.621 --> 39:14.882
He wasn't planning on
leaving the life, was he?

39:14.883 --> 39:17.785
He was conspiring with
you to betray his own father.

39:17.786 --> 39:19.457
Then when his father
found out and killed him,

39:19.458 --> 39:22.660
you realized, one
door closed, but...

39:22.661 --> 39:24.632
A dirty little window opened.

39:24.633 --> 39:27.695
I think you set up Russo
with the note at the hotel

39:27.696 --> 39:29.797
hoping he'd get shot
at the safe house,

39:29.798 --> 39:33.040
creating a power vacuum,
which you're going to fill now.

39:33.041 --> 39:34.572
Unless it's a coincidence

39:34.573 --> 39:35.943
you're flying to
New York tomorrow.

39:35.944 --> 39:38.045
Well, I'm expanding...

39:38.046 --> 39:39.807
Opening up a gym there.

39:39.808 --> 39:41.078
Congratulations.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.911
To help more troubled
kids go straight?

39:43.912 --> 39:46.414
Straight into business with you?

39:46.415 --> 39:48.015
You know, I...

39:48.016 --> 39:51.088
I wish I was half as smart
as you two make me out to be.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.394
What?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.927
Daniel Russo was just
shanked to death in prison.

39:59.928 --> 40:03.901
First the son, and
then the father...

40:03.902 --> 40:06.004
What a tragedy.

40:07.536 --> 40:09.907
Yeah, you're a
real humanitarian.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.511
Guilty as charged.

40:16.014 --> 40:19.617
You know, I've only
met you once, detective,

40:19.618 --> 40:23.951
but you strike me as the kind
of cop who lives for the chase.

40:23.952 --> 40:25.953
So what are you gonna do

40:25.954 --> 40:27.995
now that Russo's gone
and the chase is over?

40:27.996 --> 40:30.858
Oh, it's never over, Avery.

40:30.859 --> 40:33.031
Now I'm chasing you.
