08:56.762 --> 08:58.470
What? Damn.

08:58.553 --> 09:00.136
What is you hollering
like that for?

09:00.220 --> 09:01.637
I thought you had
a full day today.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.220
That summer class?

09:03.303 --> 09:04.845
The meeting with the free
legal aid office?

09:04.929 --> 09:06.720
Oh, shit, I'm late.

09:06.804 --> 09:09.136
[scoffs]
I'll reschedule.

09:09.220 --> 09:11.929
Emmett, you rescheduled
three times already.

[objects clattering lightly]

09:21.470 --> 09:23.470
- W-where are you going?
- Moving.

09:23.553 --> 09:25.804
I found a really nice
one-bedroom.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.220
I thought we was moving
next week.

09:27.303 --> 09:29.762
Wait. A one-bedroom? What?

09:33.011 --> 09:34.261
You serious?

09:34.345 --> 09:36.512
Very.

09:36.595 --> 09:38.303
Two months ago,
I said you needed

09:38.387 --> 09:39.679
to find your own place.

09:39.762 --> 09:41.512
A month ago, I told you again,

09:41.595 --> 09:43.011
you need to find
your own place.

09:43.095 --> 09:45.470
A few weeks ago,
I said it again.

09:45.553 --> 09:48.220
Well, you always saying that.
I thought you was just talking.

09:48.303 --> 09:49.345
[Jada]
That's the problem.

09:49.428 --> 09:52.178
I'm tired of talking.

09:52.261 --> 09:55.220
You haven't followed through
on anything

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
you're supposed to
these past few months--

09:56.720 --> 09:57.845
not your diploma,

09:57.929 --> 09:59.428
the custody case
with little EJ.

09:59.512 --> 10:01.261
That's not my fault,
all right?

10:01.345 --> 10:03.053
Tiff is the devil's spawn.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.261
No court is gonna be able
to deal with her evil ass, Ma.

10:05.345 --> 10:06.679
So how am I supposed to?

10:06.762 --> 10:08.220
Not my problem.

10:08.303 --> 10:12.512
You the one
that made the baby with her.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.053
So you just gonna be out
like that?

10:15.470 --> 10:18.470
That's up to you to figure out.

10:18.553 --> 10:20.804
Okay, what about EJ?
That--that's your grandson.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.637
Who hasn't spent the night here
in how long?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.428
And when was the last time
you seen EJ, huh?

10:25.512 --> 10:28.553
When was that?

10:28.637 --> 10:30.679
Again, it's not my fault.
It's Tiff.

10:30.762 --> 10:33.929
Boy...I'm tired.

10:34.011 --> 10:35.637

- [Kevin] But, Ma, I feel fine.

10:46.470 --> 10:48.720
You're not fine.
You've been through a lot.

10:48.804 --> 10:51.261
And you need to talk
to somebody about it.

10:51.345 --> 10:53.261
Why can't I just talk
to you and Karen?

10:53.345 --> 10:57.887
Look, I know it's gonna feel
weird talking to a stranger,

10:57.970 --> 11:00.595
but it's gonna be good for you,
trust me.

11:00.679 --> 11:03.512
Ma, therapy is
for white people.

11:03.595 --> 11:04.720
Okay, Kevin,
I'm not entertaining

11:04.804 --> 11:06.178
that kind of ignorance.

11:06.261 --> 11:08.095
If there is anybody
on the planet

11:08.178 --> 11:10.303
that needs therapy the most,
after 400 years of slavery,

11:10.387 --> 11:12.053
it is black folks.

11:12.136 --> 11:15.095
Why is that your answer
for everything?

11:15.178 --> 11:16.053
Oh, no.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.387
Give it to me.

- Really, Ma?
- Give it, Kevin.

11:24.637 --> 11:26.845

afterwards.

right in front of the house.

is supposed to be safe.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.929

11:43.011 --> 11:44.595
Did you see his face?

set you up?

around the way.

11:54.804 --> 11:56.970

11:57.053 --> 12:00.804
You love calling the police
for some shit.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.595
- What they gonna do?
- They might help you find it.

12:04.679 --> 12:06.512
They had 13 homicides
this weekend, J.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.762
I doubt they're worried
about my taco truck.

12:08.845 --> 12:09.970
Well, call
your insurance company

12:10.053 --> 12:11.929
and get a claim going.

12:17.553 --> 12:21.762

tell me that truck was insured.

12:23.887 --> 12:26.303
I was gonna get the insurance
and the permits next week.

12:26.387 --> 12:28.845
Really, Brandon?

12:28.929 --> 12:31.720
You always get mad at me
for treating you like a child.

12:31.804 --> 12:32.804
[clicks tongue]
Man, here you go.

12:32.887 --> 12:35.011
But maybe if you handled
your business,

12:35.095 --> 12:36.095
I wouldn't have to.

12:36.178 --> 12:39.345

Don't stress
about paying me back.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.679
I ain't taking no handouts.

12:55.762 --> 12:57.970
I'll figure out a way
to pay you back.

13:00.095 --> 13:03.220
Fine, but...

13:03.303 --> 13:06.053
maybe you need to get a job
at another restaurant...

13:06.136 --> 13:08.470

a little money for now.

13:08.553 --> 13:11.095

for white people.

are her babies.

[woman] So your mom told me
you're working

53:49.220 --> 53:51.637
on a science project at school?

53:51.720 --> 53:53.845
It's nothing.

53:53.929 --> 53:55.512
Made a volcano.

53:55.595 --> 53:57.303
[woman] Well,
how'd you make it?

53:57.387 --> 53:59.428
Out of stuff.

That kid Coogie...

54:06.553 --> 54:08.929
- let's discuss him.
- I... [sighs]

54:14.637 --> 54:16.679
[woman] He wasn't
your friend, but...

54:18.679 --> 54:21.220
...how did you feel
seeing him get shot?

54:24.053 --> 54:27.303
It's totally okay to feel bad
when somebody dies.

54:33.804 --> 54:36.845
Well, what about
the gun incident?

54:36.929 --> 54:38.720
You were in a scuffle.

54:38.804 --> 54:40.720
You fired the gun...

54:40.804 --> 54:43.136
and shot someone?

54:43.220 --> 54:45.553
Yeah.

54:45.637 --> 54:48.929
- Am I going to jail for that?
- [woman] No.

54:49.011 --> 54:51.178
You're not going
to jail, Kevin.

Is that a concern for you?

[sighs]

54:57.220 --> 54:59.178
You know...

54:59.261 --> 55:01.303
like volcanoes,

55:01.387 --> 55:05.178
humans can have eruptions
in their lives...

55:05.261 --> 55:09.303
moments that make us feel
off-center.

55:12.595 --> 55:16.095
Hey, Kevin, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

55:16.178 --> 55:18.053
Have you thought about that?

55:18.136 --> 55:20.220
Is science your thing?

55:20.303 --> 55:21.428
Or perhaps math?

55:21.512 --> 55:24.136
I like basketball...

55:24.220 --> 55:26.970
video games, drawing.

55:27.053 --> 55:30.512
I'll probably do something
like that if I grow up.

Huh.
