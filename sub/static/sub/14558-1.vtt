WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.438
(electronica-infused
rock music playing)

00:22.290 --> 00:25.826
* I wish that I could fly
into the sky *

00:25.893 --> 00:27.561
* So very high *

00:27.628 --> 00:31.532
* Just like the dragonfly *

00:33.467 --> 00:35.136
* I'd fly above the trees *

00:35.203 --> 00:37.638
* Over the seas *

00:37.705 --> 00:39.773
* All degrees *

00:39.840 --> 00:44.212
* To where I please *

00:44.278 --> 00:48.249
* Oh, I want to get away *

00:48.316 --> 00:52.786
* I want to fly away *

00:52.853 --> 00:57.925
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

00:57.991 --> 01:00.394
* I want to get away... *

01:00.461 --> 01:02.263
Doesn't look good.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.432
Richer or poorer, baby.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.400
Just like the midget
Elvis preacher said.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.736
Mm-hmm.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.974
* Let's go and see the stars,
the Milky Way *

01:14.041 --> 01:16.244
* Or even Mars *

01:16.310 --> 01:19.513
* Where they could
just be ours... *

01:19.580 --> 01:22.750
Everyone get down
on the floor now!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.085
Open the register!

01:25.153 --> 01:26.520
(register bell dings)

01:26.587 --> 01:28.422
-You, is that your Beamer?
-Yeah.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.890
-Get down.
-Give me the keys now.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.759
Keys.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.228
-* Oh, oh, yeah *
-Whatever you want, take it.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.530
* I want to get away *

01:36.597 --> 01:40.701
* I want to fly away... *

01:40.768 --> 01:41.769
Hey!

01:41.835 --> 01:45.773
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:45.839 --> 01:48.409
* I want to get away *

01:48.476 --> 01:52.079
* I want to fly away *

01:52.146 --> 01:58.051
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:58.118 --> 02:00.654
* I want to get away *

02:00.721 --> 02:05.526
* I want to fly away,
yeah... *

02:05.593 --> 02:09.530
(sirens wailing)

02:11.332 --> 02:14.668
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:18.339 --> 02:20.073
We got any descriptions?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.575
No one was
in any shape to talk,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.244
so we're pulling
the security tapes now.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.679
-Robbery?
-Call it that.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.281
Made off with $122.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.883
Plus the car. That
Mustang was hot-wired;

02:29.950 --> 02:32.220
there's, uh, gun oil
in the glove compartment,

02:32.286 --> 02:33.987
so they probably
took something else.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.390
I'll go find out
what the victims were driving.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.726
If you get anything, get an APB
out on them, all right?

02:38.792 --> 02:39.927
MEGAN:
It's not about the money.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.295
Not exclusively, anyway.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.163
Check this out.

02:43.231 --> 02:49.370
"Our love is like a flower,
it grows with every hour."

02:49.437 --> 02:50.871
That's just awful.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.873
EDGERTON: At least he got it
to rhyme this time.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.708
-MEGAN: Hey. -DON: Well,
what do you know, Ian?

02:56.043 --> 02:58.846
Buck likes burritos; he eats
them frozen, like Popsicles.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.481
-Buck?
-Winters.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.749
The other one is Crystal Hoyle.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.984
If she left prints,
they're on the cash drawer.

03:04.051 --> 03:04.952
Thanks for making the drive.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.654
-I know we're out of your AO.
-No problem.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.722
We owe Ian a favor
or two, don't we, guys?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.562
11 hits in the
last 17 days.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.530
Violent, but
strictly small-time.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.566
And crossing state lines
throws it to us.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.468
Okay, let me grab a coffee.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.670
I haven't been able
to get out ahead of them yet.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.405
There's no rhyme
or reason to their moves.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.440
They seem to go for
whatever's in front of them.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.575
And the girl's a teacher?

03:27.641 --> 03:29.743
Yeah. Winters was in
her 20th Century Europe class.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.078
His father found out
she'd been corrupting

03:31.144 --> 03:33.481
little Buck's morals
since the homecoming game.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.816
Only thing a teacher ever
gave me was detention.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.185
Yeah, well, however
the conversation went,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.553
Dad ended up
with a full clip

03:39.620 --> 03:41.589
of 9mm ball ammo
in his chest.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.691
Just seems like
a pretty extreme reaction.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.092
Well, look, I
mean, she's facing

03:45.158 --> 03:47.328
a statutory
rape charge.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.430
They tucked Dad
in Buck's garage, hit the road,

03:49.497 --> 03:51.799
started robbing their
way across the country.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.700
What do you say, guys?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.568
MEGAN: Hey, you know,
so, spree killers

03:54.635 --> 03:56.570
generally tend
to derive exhilaration

03:56.637 --> 03:58.572
from the act
itself.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.807
Now, if they're lovers,
there's gonna be

03:59.873 --> 04:02.543
a strong sexual component
to it also.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.313
Yeah, he's 17, and...
take a look at her.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.914
Still, that's
a pretty big

04:06.980 --> 04:08.416
career change for a
30-year-old teacher

04:08.482 --> 04:09.450
with no priors.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.784
Actually,
Crystal Hoyle

04:10.851 --> 04:12.453
has a sealed juvenile record
that the Texas

04:12.520 --> 04:14.121
school system
didn't know about.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.155
-Aha.
-Yeah, she was picked up

04:15.222 --> 04:16.557
for a misdemeanor
drug possession

04:16.624 --> 04:18.592
in 1992, right
here in L.A.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.294
Track someone
five, six days,

04:20.361 --> 04:23.797
you start getting hunches
that you can't exactly explain.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.000
Mine says that she's
making her way

04:27.067 --> 04:28.936
-back to your neighborhood.
-DON: All right.

04:29.002 --> 04:29.703
Why don't you get

04:29.770 --> 04:30.771
their pictures out
and check the overnights

04:30.838 --> 04:32.105
for anything that
looks like them.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.374
How about you
and I go see

04:33.441 --> 04:34.708
if we can get
these dots connected.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.981
DON: Charlie.
Whoa, whoa!

04:41.048 --> 04:43.584
CHARLIE: No, no, oh. Yeah,
this isn't what it looks like.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.085
Well, that's a relief
because it looks like

04:45.152 --> 04:47.087
your friend there
was about to perforate you.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.055
LARRY:
Actually, Professor Eppes

04:48.121 --> 04:50.791
is protected by the most
impenetrable armor of all,

04:50.858 --> 04:51.992
-physics.
-That's right.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.160
My weight is
distributed

04:53.226 --> 04:55.929
amongst the spikes
at an even 1.7 pounds each.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.631
With the kinetic energy
of the hammer...

04:57.698 --> 04:59.066
Charles, I think
the drama of demonstration

04:59.132 --> 05:00.968
would be most instructive here.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.503
Wait, wait. Hold, hold.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.904
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me just...

05:08.376 --> 05:11.011
-You all right?
-(chuckling): Yeah.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.113
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.782
(grunting)

05:14.848 --> 05:17.284
Yeah. I'm...

05:17.351 --> 05:18.819
(coughs) ...fine.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.754
If you don't
mind my asking,

05:20.821 --> 05:21.989
what exactly does
all that accomplish?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.057
LARRY: The unwavering attention
of my Faith

05:24.124 --> 05:25.593
and Physics class. Hello.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.094
Dr. Larry
Fleinhardt.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.996
-This is Agent Ian Edgerton.
-My pleasure.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.331
He's got a couple
of killers on the run.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.233
He thinks they might
be headed to L.A.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.368
EDGERTON:
Or already here.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.303
I remember how that
voodoo of yours helped

05:36.370 --> 05:38.539
-to tighten the search grid
the last time around. -Voodoo?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.774
In spite of my
invaluable assistance,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.876
on two instances,
mind you,

05:42.943 --> 05:45.379
Agent Edgerton maintains
some skepticism

05:45.446 --> 05:47.615
about the analytical
approach to man hunting.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.517
And yet, here you are.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.752
The instinct part of me
says not to miss any bets.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.787
Well, hey. Let's hope

05:53.854 --> 05:55.055
we can come up
with something

05:55.122 --> 05:56.424
a little more substantive
than instinct.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.792
All right, these dots,
representing...?

05:58.859 --> 06:02.396
Black are confirmed sightings,
red are robberies,

06:02.463 --> 06:03.897
yellow are killings.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.933
They're hitting like every
day or two, then they

06:05.999 --> 06:08.101
fall off the grid, they show up
a couple hundred miles away.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.103
I can tell you what
they eat, what they drink,

06:10.170 --> 06:11.772
what car they'll steal;
what I can't do

06:11.839 --> 06:12.806
is tell you what
they'll do next.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.542
Right. We got
amateurs, you know.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.044
Imean, for us, it's
easier to find pros.

06:20.848 --> 06:26.053
Did you forget
to mark a point here?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.221
No.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.923
-No?
-No.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.592
We had no sightings
anywhere in Wyoming.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.094
-Okay.
-Did you see

06:34.161 --> 06:35.128
some sort of pattern here?

06:35.195 --> 06:37.631
A Langevin-like equation,
maybe, or...

06:37.698 --> 06:39.633
I just thought that there
should be a point there.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.669
-What, you got a hunch?
-I don't...

06:41.735 --> 06:42.870
I don't
have hunches.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.271
You know,
when I hypothesize,

06:44.337 --> 06:45.706
is really what it is,

06:45.773 --> 06:46.807
it's an intuitive synthesis
of established

06:46.874 --> 06:48.909
mathematical principles
and theorems.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.812
Knowledge plus a guess-- where
I come from, that's a hunch.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.528
MEGAN:
Crystal is clearly the alpha.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.329
You see how all the
spoils go to her?

07:09.396 --> 07:10.664
She clears the register.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.801
Even Buck throws her
the car keys.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.402
That's pretty sloppy, though,
leaving this video.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.705
Well, unless
it's deliberate.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.573
I mean,
he fits the profile

07:19.640 --> 07:22.075
for the classic teenage
thrill-killer

07:22.142 --> 07:24.745
in which case, all he wants
is credit for every crime.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.547
-The poem.
-She's working off

07:26.614 --> 07:28.582
something entirely different.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.818
She's focused and intent.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.553
It says here she
ran away from home

07:32.620 --> 07:35.122
at age 15 and came
to Los Angeles.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.692
And that she got picked up 18
months later on a drug charge.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.093
18 months alone on the streets.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.062
It's not hard
to fill in those blanks.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.230
No.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.500
Then she went back to Texas

07:46.567 --> 07:48.769
and totally cleaned up
her life, right?

07:48.836 --> 07:52.239
She goes to college,
she gets her teaching degree.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.842
And sex education
for a high school senior.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.577
Buck's dad finds out about it.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.578
She's facing

07:57.645 --> 07:59.312
exposure,
even prison.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.581
Yeah, but this response

08:00.648 --> 08:03.183
is totally disproportionate
to the catalyst.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.117
There's something else.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.587
Yeah. Like why
a hot history teacher

08:06.654 --> 08:08.856
goes for a high school
football player.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.357
That's a question
only a 30-year-old man

08:10.423 --> 08:12.593
would have to ask.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.262
Don. That dot that
Charlie saw in Wyoming?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.598
I don't know how he
did it, but he did.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.966
Robbery on the
15th of this month.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.334
A bar outside of
Red Desert, Wyoming.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.636
A couple fitting
Crystal Hoyle

08:22.703 --> 08:24.337
and Buck Winters'
description

08:24.404 --> 08:25.472
hung around till
closing time.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.975
They put the bartender
in the hospital.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.943
They hit that gas station
in Colorado,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.244
what was that, like the 14th?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.547
I know the next sighting
was Salt Lake City the 17th.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.149
That's plenty of time to cross
in and out of Wyoming.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.384
It fits the map

08:37.450 --> 08:38.251
-and the timeline.
-Definitely.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.453
Buck always signs
his robberies-- poems,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.022
smiling at the security
camera, dropping their names.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.224
Well, maybe he didn't want
to brag about this one.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.626
Could be they had
friends close by,

08:45.693 --> 08:46.827
somebody who could hide 'em out?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.295
Yeah, why don't you
check with the Austin office.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.229
see if either of them

08:49.296 --> 08:50.497
-had any connections
in Wyoming. -All right.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.965
And then do a phone
dump on that bar.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.300
I mean, maybe
they called someone

08:53.366 --> 08:54.301
while they were
sitting around.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.408
And the beach.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.375
I've never seen the ocean.

09:02.442 --> 09:05.846
Sure, baby, I'll take
you to the beach.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.848
And that place
with the footprints

09:07.915 --> 09:09.950
in the cement
and the movie stars.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.855
-Cris?
-What, hon?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.324
That place with the cement
footprints-- what's that called?

09:17.390 --> 09:20.227
Chinese Theater.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.730
We'll go there, too.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.299
I thought you didn't

09:26.366 --> 09:28.268
like Porsches.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.738
Gas tank's almost empty.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.241
What do you figure
the boss drives?

09:34.307 --> 09:36.677
Nicest car on the lot.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.750
DON:
Hey, Dad.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.252
Oh, hey. I was looking for you.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.519
Not that difficult to find.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.455
Either the living room
of the kitchen.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.923
Ooh. Condos, huh?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.660
Yeah. All that money
I made selling the house

09:52.726 --> 09:54.561
has just been sitting
in the bank doing nothing.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.697
My accountant said
I should reinvest.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.766
You know what they say
about real estate.

09:58.832 --> 09:59.967
No, what do they say?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.702
Actually, I don't
know. I've never owned

10:01.769 --> 10:03.570
anything, but, you know,
you read about the bubble.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.604
They say it can't hurt

10:04.672 --> 10:05.605
to wait, so...

10:05.673 --> 10:06.974
Well, you know,
actually, um...

10:07.040 --> 10:09.242
It's not about reinvestment,
actually, it's, uh...

10:09.309 --> 10:12.245
Do you realize
I haven't lived by myself

10:12.312 --> 10:13.280
for over 40 years.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.882
What? You're talking
about actually moving out?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.917
I'm considering it.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.318
Well, this looks like some
pretty serious considering, Dad.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.587
Well, I've been making
a list of all the things

10:20.654 --> 10:23.090
I still want to do and...

10:23.156 --> 10:25.492
I would just like to do
some things on my own.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.994
Mm-hmm. Charlie?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.528
I haven't told him yet.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.297
A-And I would rather you didn't.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.165
Yeah, well,
you're on your own there.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.267
Actually, you should get one
with a tennis court.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.503
I don't play tennis.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.071
Yeah, but I do.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.494
(cocks shotgun)

11:01.561 --> 11:03.630
Hey. I'm not a hero.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.898
Take anything you want.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.700
What do you think we want?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.703
Hundred-thousand-dollar car.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.373
Cris?

11:14.742 --> 11:17.010
Crystal?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.583
Get his keys.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.786
I thought you said
we didn't have any secrets!

11:25.853 --> 11:28.121
That's not a secret.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.389
Really?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.791
What the hell do you call that?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.259
Pile of dead bones.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.727
All you need to know

11:33.794 --> 11:36.396
is that you have my heart.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.467
Now get the keys.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.083
This is Pierce Brenner.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.185
His name's on the sign.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.054
Sent all the employees home
at 8:15, locked up.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.722
Salesman forgot his wallet,

12:02.790 --> 12:05.092
came back and found
the body by 9:00,

12:05.158 --> 12:06.693
and now Brenner's car
is missing.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.329
Makes sense. They've been
switching cars every day or two.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.932
Yeah, but always
a subordinate act

12:11.999 --> 12:14.868
to a more flamboyant,
violent one.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.270
These dealerships are like
fishbowls at night--

12:17.337 --> 12:20.007
it's easy to see in,
hard to see out.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.348
They watched from over here.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.651
Spree killers act on impulse;
they don't generally

12:31.718 --> 12:32.786
stalk their victims.

12:32.853 --> 12:33.921
You think they
targeted this guy?

12:33.987 --> 12:36.056
She was here in L.A. in '92.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.658
Awful long time
to hold a grudge.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.760
Bad memories last a long time.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.829
This is the second crime

12:41.895 --> 12:43.463
they haven't signed.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.798
New MO.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
Something's changing.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.002
I can't help but thinking that
the very things that elude me

12:49.069 --> 12:50.703
about this
particular case

12:50.770 --> 12:53.841
are-are pivotal
to helping Don.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.542
You know?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.678
You know, because the knotty
problem with spree criminals

12:58.745 --> 12:59.712
is that their actions

12:59.779 --> 13:02.415
most closely approximate
true randomness,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.017
with such a wide range
of variables.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.053
So much so that it's usually
only their mistakes

13:06.119 --> 13:09.022
that lead to their
apprehension,

13:09.089 --> 13:10.290
you know, not-not
some sort of

13:10.357 --> 13:13.060
a predictive analysis,
not-not, uh...

13:14.694 --> 13:16.463
I'm rambling.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.464
Yeah.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.035
I'm rambling because,
um, you invited me

13:22.102 --> 13:23.770
here to this dinner

13:23.837 --> 13:25.906
most likely to tell
me that you have

13:25.973 --> 13:28.441
accepted Harvard's offer.

13:28.508 --> 13:32.312
And I guess I'm just trying
to fill the air with noise

13:32.379 --> 13:35.182
to keep you from
telling me that...

13:35.248 --> 13:36.583
-Charlie.
-Um, but...

13:36.649 --> 13:39.152
Charlie.

13:39.219 --> 13:42.589
I've accepted Cal Sci's
professorship offer.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.691
I'm staying.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.794
Well, that's great.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.363
Well, that's great news
for Cal Sci, of course.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.664
-You know...
-(chuckles softly)

13:51.731 --> 13:52.866
No, I-I do believe

13:52.933 --> 13:55.936
we-we have
a far superior program...

13:56.003 --> 13:59.572
It's a great opportunity,
and, um...

13:59.639 --> 14:03.510
hopefully, it's a great
opportunity for us as well.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.845
"Us."

14:05.913 --> 14:08.181
Charlie, over these
last few years,

14:08.248 --> 14:11.584
you and I have stopped
and started so many times.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.122
I know I for one would...

14:15.188 --> 14:17.424
very much like to see
what happens.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.301
I'm just not sure
how to break it to Charlie.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.437
Well, might I suggest directly?

14:30.503 --> 14:31.939
He doesn't take change
that well, you know.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.506
When I tried to sell my house,
he bought it.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.843
Eh, don't underestimate
Charles' ability to adapt.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.245
You know,
over the last few years,

14:38.311 --> 14:40.347
he's made some
very striking changes,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.182
overwhelmingly
for the better.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.816
Mm-hmm. I suppose
you're right.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.985
I mean, after all,

14:45.052 --> 14:47.020
I would expect him to be
just as candid with me.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.355
By the way,

14:48.421 --> 14:50.123
since you've sold your house,
where have you been living?

14:50.190 --> 14:53.226
Oh, just various people's sofas,

14:53.293 --> 14:55.595
the car, my office sometimes.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.164
You mean you're homeless?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.067
No, no, no,
just without an address.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.134
Intentionally so.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.503
You know, I've just
come to realize

15:03.570 --> 15:06.139
that committing oneself
to a permanent space

15:06.206 --> 15:08.575
just constrains one's
intellectual vista.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.576
Hmm.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.812
Last week, I spent several
nights in the mountains,

15:12.879 --> 15:14.281
contemplating the heavens--

15:14.347 --> 15:16.016
and this from a non-cosmological
point of view--

15:16.083 --> 15:18.718
for the first time
in years.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.989
Hmm. And, uh,

15:22.055 --> 15:23.723
how does Megan
feel about

15:23.790 --> 15:25.392
this vagabond style of yours?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.961
Well, I've had to explain to her
that there's got to be

15:28.028 --> 15:30.163
some sort of a firewall,
if you will,

15:30.230 --> 15:32.265
between one's
romantic aspirations

15:32.332 --> 15:34.667
and the larger life goals.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.069
Mm-hmm. You're in check.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.171
Oh, yeah, so I am.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.509
Larry, I'm going to give you
the same advice

15:42.575 --> 15:44.311
that I've given to all
the geniuses I know.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.079
-Which is?
-Don't be an idiot.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.482
Yeah.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.200
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.669
Two hours before
Crystal Hoyle

16:09.736 --> 16:11.604
and Buck Winters robbed
that bar in Wyoming,

16:11.671 --> 16:14.207
a call was made from
the bar's pay phone

16:14.274 --> 16:15.508
to Venice, California.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.643
Number came back

16:16.709 --> 16:20.113
to a Lydia Campos.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.649
Possession and intent to sell.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.850
Look at May 13, '92.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.986
Picked up on a drug sweep
with Crystal Hoyle.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.155
Now, there's
a coincidence.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.656
Fortunately, a judge
didn't think so.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.990
He gave us a
Title 3 wiretap.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.493
I figured we'd giveit some time
before we brought Lydia in,

16:33.560 --> 16:35.662
-(phone ringing) -see if
Crystal tries to contact her.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.399
We have a call coming in.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.667
(phone ringing)

16:40.733 --> 16:42.069
LYDIA:
Yeah?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.870
CRYSTAL:
I'm here, in L.A.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.573
You going to help me out?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.178
Do I have a choice?

16:51.244 --> 16:53.246
Yeah, always.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.614
I remember once I had a choice

16:54.681 --> 16:56.849
between getting busted and
letting my best friend O.D.

16:56.916 --> 16:57.917
(device beeping)

16:57.984 --> 16:59.686
Hold on, come
on, come on.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.521
So, you'll help.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.456
I'll ask around.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.925
Pay phone, Washington
and Broadway.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.427
(dialing)

17:07.494 --> 17:09.296
What about the other thing?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.763
You really going to do it?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.066
Watch the news tonight.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.039
(dial tone)

17:29.082 --> 17:30.783
We got the phone,
but they're gone.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.918
DISPATCH:
Copy that.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.986
Wonder what they
were doing in this area.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.255
New car.

17:35.322 --> 17:38.125
That's the Porsche they stole
from the car dealership.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.792
Two in one night?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.129
Maybe they didn't
like the upholstery.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.733
Blood on the bumper.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.285
Two cars, two
dead bodies.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.819
No robbery, no poem.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.157
Reeves is right--
something's changing.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.425
Hoyle and Winters
have now switched

18:12.492 --> 18:17.564
to a 1978 Trans Am,
license plate 3X722H2.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.533
DISPATCH:
Copy your vehicle description.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.508
(knock at door)

18:37.384 --> 18:39.586
Come back in an hour.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.459
Hey, do you know
who you're playing with?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.861
Do you know
what you're standing in?

18:51.798 --> 18:52.865
91 octane.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.066
I knew a guy

18:54.133 --> 18:55.468
lit a cigarette
in a lab.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.836
He's still in
the burn ward.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.672
Open the door.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.484
MAN: Put it away.
Put it away.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.889
On your knees!
Get on your knees!

19:19.726 --> 19:21.394
-No trouble, lady.
-Sure there is, man.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.396
People like you
screwing up kids,

19:23.463 --> 19:25.097
someone's children.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.601
It's here, just
like she said.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.170
What?

19:31.238 --> 19:32.405
Feels like we forgot something.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.807
No, Cris, come on.
Let's just go.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.875
You love me or not?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.277
Of course I love you.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.650
Go.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.725
(tires screeching)

20:04.504 --> 20:07.374
Witnesses saw a male
white and female white

20:07.440 --> 20:09.442
flee the scene in a Trans Am.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.543
Size-nine work
boots.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.912
See the star-shaped scuff
on the insole?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.181
Buck picked that up between
Kansas and Missouri.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.684
You know, meth labs
like to use

20:17.750 --> 20:18.851
users as workers

20:18.918 --> 20:20.487
'cause they can pay
them in product.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.022
Lydia Campos-- you figure
she worked here

20:23.089 --> 20:24.524
-gave them the setup?
-Right.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.125
They got to have $50,
$100 Gs in cash

20:26.192 --> 20:27.226
around here, double
that in product.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.161
It's never been about
the money before.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.998
Yeah, but drugs are what
got Crystal arrested

20:32.064 --> 20:33.165
and sent back home.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.401
Maybe this was symbolic

20:34.467 --> 20:36.235
or retributive.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.539
Or it's all about grenades.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.675
Hey, I got a whole cache
of weapons up here, guys.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.127
Do I, do I have something
on my...

21:01.193 --> 21:02.362
on the side
of my mouth?

21:02.429 --> 21:03.563
I'm moving out.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.766
Okay.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.901
What I mean is,
it's a good time to buy,

21:08.968 --> 21:11.371
and, no, it has nothing
to do with you.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.805
I like living with you.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.642
It's just that I'd like
to try living by myself.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.379
Yeah, no, okay,
I can, I-I can see that.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.780
-You can?
-Yeah.

21:20.847 --> 21:25.284
Well, you haven't lived alone
in, what, 50 years?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.886
-Forty.
-Okay.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.656
How can a math genius not know
how old his father is?

21:29.722 --> 21:32.124
Of course I'm going
to miss you.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.460
Well, I mean,
its not like

21:33.526 --> 21:35.261
I'm moving out of the city
or anything.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.731
I mean, uh, we're going
to see each other all the time.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.833
Look at this, this is pretty,
pretty nice, you know.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.269
You got a swimming
pool and a tennis court.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.005
You going to play tennis?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.840
Are you sure you're
all right with this?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.443
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm sure.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.612
Why would I not be
all right, right?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.447
It's just that you seem
a little bit more all right

21:54.514 --> 21:56.349
than I would expect.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.686
No, go, go, uh,
sow your wild oats.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.688
Right?

22:16.703 --> 22:18.971
Ah, the elusive
mystery dot.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.574
Point.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.309
And the reason
I found it

22:23.376 --> 22:25.478
is still eluding me.

22:25.545 --> 22:29.982
Yeah, you know, Otto Loewi
spent 17 years searching

22:30.049 --> 22:31.183
for proof that nervous

22:31.250 --> 22:33.386
impulses are
chemically transmitted?

22:33.453 --> 22:34.787
It came to him
one night in a dream.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.856
And he wrote it down,
but the next morning,

22:36.923 --> 22:38.525
he woke up, he couldn't read
his own handwriting.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.926
Now fortunately,

22:39.992 --> 22:43.129
he had the same
dream the next night.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.597
Good for Otto Loewi.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.334
What do you want me to say--
my Dad is moving out.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.402
You know that?

22:49.469 --> 22:50.937
-Yeah.
-He's moving into one of those

22:51.003 --> 22:53.372
singles, you know,
bachelor... you knew?

22:53.440 --> 22:56.409
Yeah. He was concerned
about how you'd react.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.244
I don't know why, you know.

22:58.310 --> 23:01.280
If this is something he wants
to do, I want him to be happy.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.682
You know?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.417
Granted, it is weird;
it seems like

23:04.484 --> 23:07.253
in less than 24 hours,
I lost a housemate

23:07.319 --> 23:09.188
and kind of gained a girlfriend.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.223
Girlfriend?

23:11.290 --> 23:13.793
Wait, I knew that Amita had
accepted the job at Cal Sci,

23:13.860 --> 23:16.563
-but...
-What if she stayed here for me?

23:16.629 --> 23:19.098
I don't know.
I'm not one to, you know,

23:19.165 --> 23:21.968
interpret the innermost workings
of the female psyche,

23:22.034 --> 23:23.302
but girlfriend?

23:23.369 --> 23:25.037
I mean, I'm happy,

23:25.104 --> 23:28.040
but, uh... but...

23:28.107 --> 23:29.476
But what?

23:29.542 --> 23:30.743
It's a lot of
responsibility.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.311
-You know?
-Yeah.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.813
What if we don't work out?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.515
You know, we've only been
on a few dates, really.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.818
What if she gave up
this job for--

23:38.885 --> 23:40.487
Oh, my God, what if she wants
to move into my house

23:40.553 --> 23:41.988
now that my Dad is gone?

23:42.054 --> 23:45.024
You're getting a little ahead
of yourself here, aren't you?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.059
I mean...

23:47.126 --> 23:48.094
Well, but still...

23:48.160 --> 23:50.196
Now, see, there's "still."
Still, still what?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.732
(sighs)

23:52.799 --> 23:54.734
This could be the old saw.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.036
You chased her
till she caught you.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.106
I chased.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.850
So really this map
is telling us a story.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.720
It's the story of two people
traveling across the country,

24:13.786 --> 24:14.954
committing crimes.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.355
But that's only half the story.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.690
You see,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.759
it's as if we're
looking at a plane

24:19.826 --> 24:21.994
flying across the sky
banking and spinning.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.896
Now, if we follow
its flight path,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.298
we may be able
to discern a pattern.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.701
Perhaps even
an eventual destination.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.904
However, there is something
that this map isn't showing us.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.507
What we're not seeing is
that there is a second plane

24:34.574 --> 24:36.509
chasing after that first plane.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.377
It's affecting its movement.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.581
It's weighing in on each
of the pilot's decisions.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.283
I'm that second plane.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.451
AMITA:
Exactly.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.621
When we plot your movements
against those of your targets--

24:48.688 --> 24:50.523
the pattern makes
itself known.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.024
Oh, some pattern.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.059
They hit, I chase.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.662
Oh, not exactly, I mean,
for instance, you came

24:55.728 --> 24:57.730
to Los Angeles before you even
knew they were here.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.365
Well, on a little bit
of information and a big hunch.

24:59.431 --> 25:00.399
LARRY:
And when we

25:00.466 --> 25:05.638
plotted your path,
against Hoyle and Winters',

25:05.705 --> 25:07.273
we got this.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.374
The missing
Wyoming dot.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.611
Yeah. This is
the Red Desert robbery.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.012
The missing point on a curve

25:13.079 --> 25:14.614
that I didn't even realize
I was looking at.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.148
It's a variation

25:16.215 --> 25:18.217
on something
called a pursuit curve.

25:18.284 --> 25:21.220
It's created when one point
chases after another.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.591
See, if a fighter pilot
aims straight at the point

25:24.657 --> 25:26.225
where he sees an enemy plane,

25:26.292 --> 25:29.095
by the time he gets there,
that plane's going to be gone.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.464
So, in order to maintain
his following distance,

25:32.531 --> 25:34.100
he has to adjust his direction,

25:34.166 --> 25:36.535
matching the movements
of his quarry.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.606
Now, if he wants
to catch that plane,

25:39.672 --> 25:40.907
he has to anticipate
its movement,

25:40.973 --> 25:43.610
aim his nose ahead
of the lead plane.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.712
(machine gunfire)

25:45.778 --> 25:47.580
You have been locked

25:47.647 --> 25:49.548
in a pursuit curve
with the killers.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.017
Charlie, can the
curve tell us

25:51.083 --> 25:52.384
where they're going
to turn up next?

25:52.451 --> 25:56.055
Well, Laplace said that
if he knew the velocity

25:56.122 --> 25:57.590
and position of
every particle

25:57.657 --> 25:59.792
in the universe, he
could predict every

25:59.859 --> 26:01.728
future event.
DON: Sure. I mean,

26:01.794 --> 26:03.462
the same principles
apply to human behavior.

26:03.529 --> 26:04.664
Right?

26:04.731 --> 26:06.132
Megan, we will
need to see

26:06.198 --> 26:07.700
all of your
profiling data.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.901
CHARLIE:
And, Ian, we're going

26:08.968 --> 26:12.171
to need more data on your
tracking methodology.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.948
You get the feeling that
everybody's forgotten about us?

26:22.014 --> 26:25.184
I get that feeling a lot.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.388
(phone rings)

26:29.455 --> 26:30.990
She's getting a call.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.058
LYDIA:
Yeah?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.360
CRYSTAL: Did you see the news
about the meth lab?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.228
Yeah. It was just like
I told you, wasn't it?

26:36.295 --> 26:37.296
Yeah.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.298
Listen to me.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.635
Maybe you should just leave
well enough alone, you know?

26:42.702 --> 26:44.470
Just, uh... go.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.438
Leave well
enough alone?

26:46.505 --> 26:47.573
I just meant that, uh...

26:47.640 --> 26:48.708
Look, there's a bag for you.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.877
It's under the mailbox
on the corner.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.181
You're a good friend.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.085
DAVID:
Lydia Campos just got

26:59.151 --> 27:00.753
a call from
Crystal Hoyle.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.554
Yeah, yeah. We heard.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.190
The mailbox she's talking about
is visible from the front door.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.658
We go for it, she's
going to see us.

27:05.725 --> 27:06.693
She's still our best lead.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.727
We've got
to let her run.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.895
What if the bag
that Crystal

27:08.961 --> 27:10.396
just left for her
is full of hand grenades?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.131
DON: I agree. I don't
think we can risk it.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.199
Risk? What about

27:13.265 --> 27:15.134
letting these two run loose
for even one more day?

27:15.201 --> 27:16.502
Ian, there's no decision here.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.970
Take it! David, take the bag!

27:24.677 --> 27:26.145
How you doing, Lydia?

27:26.212 --> 27:28.314
Come on. I'm not carrying.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.816
No, you were just going
to mail a letter, right?

27:29.882 --> 27:31.217
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.120
Things that people leave
under mailboxes.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.788
No way you can say that's mine.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.824
No. Not anymore.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.192
Turn around and put
your hands on your head.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.266
You got the drugs back.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.100
What else do you want?

27:48.167 --> 27:51.103
We want Crystal,
and the grenades

27:51.170 --> 27:54.040
you virtually handed her
from the meth lab.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.877
This girl is supposed
to be your friend, right?

27:57.944 --> 28:00.179
You've known her since '92.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.214
-You were waitresses together.
-We were both just kids.

28:02.281 --> 28:05.417
No. She was just
a 15-year-old kid

28:05.484 --> 28:06.385
who had run
away from home.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.987
Her parents were pushing her
for grades.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.388
They wouldn't let her hang out.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.825
It didn't sound like a house
I would have run away from.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.795
And how long was it before
you got her into drugs?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.263
It wasn't me.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.932
She got involved
with this married guy.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.567
You know,
the kind that

28:21.633 --> 28:23.602
comes on like he's a friend,

28:23.669 --> 28:24.937
finds her
an apartment.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.272
And, before he says
what he really wants,

28:26.338 --> 28:28.107
it's too late for her
to say no anymore?

28:28.174 --> 28:32.611
Six months later, she and
Billy turned up on my doorstep,

28:32.678 --> 28:34.613
looking for a
place to crash.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.982
Billy being the married guy?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.984
Billy being
the rebound guy.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.285
He was a total loser.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.054
I tried to tell Cris that,
but this married guy,

28:42.121 --> 28:43.555
he screwed her
up real good.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.892
Billy's the reason
we got busted, though.

28:45.958 --> 28:46.993
They were his drugs.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.296
After, she was sent back
to Texas.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.769
So why did she call you
15 years later?

28:56.836 --> 28:59.972
She said she met someone...

29:00.039 --> 29:02.208
someone who was going
to help make things right.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.045
When I told her
about the meth lab

29:06.112 --> 29:08.781
and all the guns,
she got real interested.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.549
What about Billy?

29:10.616 --> 29:12.584
Where am I supposed to find him?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.921
I don't know.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.356
Crystal asked me the same thing.

29:27.666 --> 29:31.003
Billy Rivers. Arrested
for dealing, bunco, stealing.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.872
Jack of all trades,
master of none.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.041
And nobody's heard from him
for about two days.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.009
Right. Right around the time
Hoyle hit town.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.111
If Reeves is right
about the meth lab hit,

29:39.178 --> 29:40.479
Crystal's on some
payback kick.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.549
The guy who got her busted
would be up on the list.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.750
Yeah, along with Pierce Brenner.

29:44.817 --> 29:45.885
The dead car salesman.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.919
MEGAN:
Yeah.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.320
In 1992, he was working

29:48.387 --> 29:50.990
at a car dealership
three blocks from where

29:51.057 --> 29:52.591
Crystal and Lydia
were waiting tables.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.061
Lydia said that Crystal
disappeared with a married guy.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.096
All right, so what?
She runs away,

29:57.163 --> 29:58.664
she hooks up with Brenner,
rebounds

29:58.730 --> 30:00.032
with Billy Rivers and drugs.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.834
This isn't
about a rebound.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.303
This girl has
crossed a threshold.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.939
She is 15 years old, and there
are no more boundaries.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.841
DAVID: Wait. But she moved
back home, right?

30:08.908 --> 30:10.109
Straightened
her life out,

30:10.176 --> 30:12.144
and became some kind
of model citizen.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.345
Yeah. Until Buck Winters,

30:13.412 --> 30:15.514
and the unfulfilled fantasy
of innocent love,

30:15.581 --> 30:18.117
and the way that her life
could have gone.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.151
Until she killed
the kid's father.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.252
Right. Destroying
any boundaries

30:20.319 --> 30:22.922
she had left at all,
plunging her into

30:22.989 --> 30:25.191
this even darker fantasy,
where she kills

30:25.257 --> 30:26.392
the older guy
who used her,

30:26.458 --> 30:28.160
and destroys the drugs
that sent her back

30:28.227 --> 30:30.863
to this middle-class lifestyle
that she never even wanted.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.298
She's erasing her mistakes.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.833
Billy Rivers is one
of those mistakes.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.836
Well, we better find him
before she does, right?

30:37.904 --> 30:39.838
* *

31:03.229 --> 31:05.631
I mean, we've been
through his known associates,

31:05.697 --> 31:06.933
his favorite
hangouts, right?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.134
The guy is hiding.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.868
And Hoyle and Winters are
out there looking for him.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.137
What do you think
about, you know,

31:11.203 --> 31:15.707
like, adjusting the
pursuit curve for that?

31:15.774 --> 31:18.810
Uh... for Crystal
chasing Rivers.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.878
If we can
find him fast,

31:19.946 --> 31:21.180
he'd be good bait.

31:22.748 --> 31:26.685
You know, I've... I've
been running expressions

31:26.752 --> 31:28.720
assuming a dog
chasing a cat.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.223
It's actually a dog
chasing a cat chasing a mouse.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.291
I thought I was an airplane.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.126
Oh, cats and dogs
work better now.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.262
The cat has two sets

31:36.328 --> 31:37.663
of points affecting it now:

31:37.729 --> 31:39.932
the way she adjusts
her angle of pursuit

31:39.999 --> 31:41.367
to overtake the mouse,

31:41.433 --> 31:44.303
and the strategy she employs
to evade the dog.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.804
Obviously,
the dog's optimal strategy

31:45.871 --> 31:47.206
is to head for the mouse

31:47.273 --> 31:48.740
and let the cat come to him.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.209
Then we don't have to know
his location, right?

31:50.276 --> 31:51.843
Just where Hoyle is going
to be looking for him.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.681
Exactly. So, if we adjust,

31:55.747 --> 31:56.983
and weight values

31:57.049 --> 31:59.818
for Rivers' previous known
locations-- so old addresses

31:59.885 --> 32:01.720
and sites of
arrest and such,

32:01.787 --> 32:03.589
eliminating places
that we know

32:03.655 --> 32:07.726
Hoyle has already searched,
while using them to infer her

32:07.793 --> 32:10.029
-decision patterns...
-Voodoo.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.910
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.112
You ready?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.280
We're supposed to go to dinner.

32:28.347 --> 32:33.352
Yeah, but if you're in
the middle of something...

32:33.419 --> 32:35.687
I am. I'm in the middle
of pursuit curves.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.723
I'm just trying to reduce
Don's search options

32:37.789 --> 32:39.425
for those spree killers.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.161
-Okay.
-Yeah, but you know, um...

32:42.228 --> 32:44.296
I can take a break, you know?

32:44.363 --> 32:46.298
As long as we
go someplace close.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.168
No. Charlie, this is clearly
more important than dinner.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.970
It is important, but you

32:52.038 --> 32:54.073
are important, too.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.376
Look, Charlie, we'll
both have to eat again.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.445
Anyway, I have a
seminar on Thursday

32:59.511 --> 33:02.081
on the adaptive enumeration
of implicit surfaces,

33:02.148 --> 33:03.682
and I should probably
go over my notes.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.751
Yeah. You sure?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.953
I'm sure.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.921
Okay. (chuckles)

33:09.988 --> 33:12.991
Okay.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.130
(sighs)

33:18.197 --> 33:20.832
MEGAN (over radio): Warrant's
a go on the cousin's house.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.368
Get in there.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.436
Charlie's math says Crystal
should show up here next.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.440
Guys, intel has Billy Rivers'
cousin in the back bedroom.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.042
Copy that.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.544
(woman laughing)

33:41.553 --> 33:42.288
(quietly):
FBI,

33:42.354 --> 33:44.022
sorry about this.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.424
We have
the two occupants secured:

33:45.491 --> 33:47.359
Rivers' cousin
and girlfriend.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.528
You're clear to extract.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.632
Even with all of Charlie's math,
your psych profiles,

33:53.699 --> 33:56.235
we're putting a lot of eggs
in this basket.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.469
You know that Crystal's looking
for Rivers.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.970
She's been on the streets,

33:59.037 --> 34:00.306
talking to all the same people
as us.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.007
MAN: Sir, I need you
to hurry, please.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.543
Yeah, we're coming, okay?

34:04.610 --> 34:06.345
It's amazing.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.949
When someone who starts
with all the advantages:

34:11.016 --> 34:14.286
good home, good parents,
ends up here.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.456
I don't think
she wanted advantages.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.226
I think she just wanted
to see what was out there.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.495
A little advice?

34:25.264 --> 34:27.433
When you get into heads
like theirs,

34:27.499 --> 34:30.202
make sure they don't get
into yours, too.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.371
You're probably right.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.483
Trans Am is coming up
Vineland.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.788
MEGAN: We've got Winters;
it looks like he's alone.

34:55.060 --> 34:57.829
Trans Am is parked
two houses up.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.432
She must be in a second car--
they never split up.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.833
Yeah, but the streets are empty.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.868
She's not in the zone.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.743
-He's coming into the backyard.
-Copy that.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.459
He's making his way
to the back door.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.495
COLBY:
Copy that.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.366
Two more seconds,

35:34.433 --> 35:35.501
we're going to have
to take him.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.436
MEGAN:
Everybody, go now.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.643
FBI! FBI, don't move!

35:52.384 --> 35:54.820
That was a hell of a shot.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.424
Better than he deserves.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.437
I'm not telling you
where she is.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.405
DON: He doesn't know.
He's bait.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.874
She almost got him killed.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.845
You don't understand her.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.547
Cris loves me so much,

36:21.613 --> 36:23.549
she never lets me
out of her sight.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.717
I had to wait for her
to fall asleep just to leave.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.320
She shot his father
14 times, right?

36:28.387 --> 36:31.022
-Fourteen. -My mother
drank herself to death

36:31.089 --> 36:32.491
over that old bastard's abuse,

36:32.558 --> 36:34.526
and Cris was the only one
who was there for me.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.263
He wanted to get her fired
for that.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.332
And she killed him
to protect your secret?

36:40.399 --> 36:41.800
You're not listening.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.238
I killed him.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.940
I'll kill anyone
who tries to hurt her.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.012
The things she's already
been through in life.

36:54.079 --> 36:57.182
You didn't tell her
where you were going, did you?

36:57.249 --> 36:59.251
You wanted to get

36:59.318 --> 37:00.852
to Rivers before she did?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.854
Cris wants to talk to him.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.090
This guy who lied
to her, he used her,

37:05.156 --> 37:06.358
he got her arrested.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.993
Look, you see what she did
to Brenner?

37:08.059 --> 37:11.162
What almost happened
to you, huh?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.564
If you love her, Buck,

37:12.631 --> 37:14.833
you have to help us
take her safely.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.535
Take her?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.741
You can't lock up
a force of nature.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.115
Hey, how'd it go?

37:30.181 --> 37:31.249
Any new information?

37:31.317 --> 37:32.818
He's young, stupid
and in love.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.586
I don't think he's
going to budge.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.188
You got any juice left
on those pursuit curves?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.690
I'll take
another look,

37:38.757 --> 37:40.258
but I suspect we're
no longer looking

37:40.326 --> 37:42.728
at anything
like a classic pursuit.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.400
You know Dad's planning
on moving out, right?

37:48.467 --> 37:49.535
You okay with it?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.069
Of course I'm okay.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.305
I mean, no, I'm going to miss
him, though.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.507
I'm going to miss the guy,
but I can certainly understand

37:55.574 --> 37:56.775
his point of view.

37:56.842 --> 38:00.111
Yeah, watch, he'll become
this big stud, you know?

38:00.178 --> 38:01.613
Yeah, right.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.783
Something else?

38:04.850 --> 38:10.822
Oh, um, Amita, she decided
to stay at Cal Sci.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.825
Oh, no season tickets
for the Bruins? What?

38:13.892 --> 38:16.395
Dude, I wasn't ever
going to move to Boston.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.996
Well, so what's
the problem?

38:18.063 --> 38:18.997
There's no problem.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.399
No, no, no,
don't get me wrong.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.700
No, she's amazing.
She's an amazing woman.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.402
It just seems like
I keep wondering

38:23.469 --> 38:27.773
if she's thinking, "Is this
what I gave up Harvard for?"

38:27.839 --> 38:28.707
Ah, she stayed.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.576
She wants the same things
you want.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.978
Maybe I don't want
those things, though, you know?

38:36.281 --> 38:40.185
Hmm. Yeah, look, I don't know.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.353
I mean, I don't know
if relationships

38:41.420 --> 38:45.290
are ever exactly
what we want.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.525
I mean, me and Robin...

38:46.592 --> 38:48.059
You like her?

38:48.126 --> 38:50.462
Yeah, I like her, I just...

38:50.529 --> 38:51.963
I don't know.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.966
Look, you say you wanted
a second chance.

38:55.033 --> 38:55.867
You got it, you know?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.469
The only thing that'll
screw that up...

38:57.536 --> 39:00.639
-Is me?
-Yeah, exactly.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.141
(shackles rattling)

39:03.208 --> 39:05.677
(garbled radio transmission)

39:16.422 --> 39:18.757
(engine starting)

39:25.531 --> 39:27.999
(car alarm chirps)

39:46.785 --> 39:51.723
17 years old and
his future is already

39:51.790 --> 39:52.924
a forgone conclusion.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.793
You know how fearsome
a thought that is

39:54.860 --> 39:56.928
that a single choice
can determine a destiny?

39:56.995 --> 39:59.397
Buck Winters'
or Crystal Hoyle's destiny?

39:59.465 --> 40:01.600
One is essentially
a child,

40:01.667 --> 40:03.268
the other's a
fully-formed adult.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.404
Formed around
a 15-year-old girl

40:06.472 --> 40:07.706
who made the kind
of bad decisions

40:07.773 --> 40:08.774
that 15-year-old girls make,

40:08.840 --> 40:10.642
and then those decisions
stay with you

40:10.709 --> 40:12.210
for the rest of your life.

40:12.277 --> 40:16.448
I am detecting here an authority
that transcends the theoretical.

40:16.515 --> 40:21.152
Well... I didn't run away from
home, but I didn't walk, either.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.555
And unlike Crystal,

40:23.622 --> 40:25.524
I can live with all
of my decisions.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.726
I don't even regret
most of them.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.495
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

40:29.561 --> 40:34.299
Listen, I live in hotel rooms,
I sleep on office sofas. I...

40:34.365 --> 40:36.568
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

40:36.635 --> 40:41.239
No, I find it
oddly attractive.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.108
(chuckles)

40:43.174 --> 40:47.646
You continually put me
in mind of the M57 nebula.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.681
Both of you with these
layers upon layers

40:49.748 --> 40:52.217
of endless complexity.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.352
You know, I don't think
I'm ever going to tire

40:54.419 --> 40:56.788
of being compared
to the M57 nebula.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.458
And thank you
for breakfast.

41:00.526 --> 41:03.094
I was way too wound up
to go home.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.999
Hey, you should
give me a call

41:08.066 --> 41:09.901
when your orbit
comes back around.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.504
Maybe towards
my place sometime.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.105
(chuckles)

41:18.176 --> 41:22.347
(car starts)

41:22.413 --> 41:24.683
(car drives away)

41:25.951 --> 41:28.620
Not exactly the kind of
guy I pictured you with.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.590
I really wouldn't
if I were you.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.327
You know who I am,

41:36.394 --> 41:37.863
so you know what I'm capable of.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.100
We live or we die,
it's your choice.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.007
What do you want to do?

41:50.341 --> 41:53.178
Do you want to live
or do you want to die?

41:53.244 --> 41:58.617
What I want is you to get
in the car and drive.
