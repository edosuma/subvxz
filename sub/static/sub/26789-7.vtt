01:26.878 --> 01:28.630
There are two kinds of pain.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.175
The sort of pain that makes you strong.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.761
Or useless pain...

01:35.887 --> 01:38.014
the sort of pain that's only suffering.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.810
I have no patience for useless things.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.079
I turn around and see her,

02:02.622 --> 02:05.458
my darling wife,
poised on the front stoop.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.586
Surely she saw everything.

02:09.419 --> 02:13.508
The killing, the lying about it,
but doesn't say a word.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.012
She just enters the house
in quiet compliance.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.141
This is love.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.310
Everyone should be so...

04:35.692 --> 04:37.735
<i>My beloved Americans.</i>

04:38.319 --> 04:41.239
<i>My heart is very full today.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:45.618
<i>I am here to talk about the future.</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:49.706
<i>And the future has become very personal.</i>

04:55.128 --> 05:00.300
<i>We are gathered here at the very center
of our great nation</i>

05:01.509 --> 05:04.512
<i>to celebrate this historic
Women's Conference.</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:11.019
<i>This is a profound moment
for all Americans.</i>

05:23.614 --> 05:25.908
But it's also a perilous time

05:25.992 --> 05:27.869
in our history, my friends.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.956
Because the American oligarchs out there,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.460
they are coming for us.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.671
They are trying to strip me
of my constitutional power

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
as your Commander In Chief.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.552
Now the lower court ruled in my favor,

05:44.635 --> 05:46.804
but now they've taken this case

05:46.888 --> 05:49.307
all the way to the Supreme Court.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.852
And they want my finger
off the nuclear button.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.188
And I have to ask...

05:55.730 --> 05:57.648
Why do you think that is?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.031
These oligarchs,

06:05.114 --> 06:07.533
through an innocent seeming app,

06:07.950 --> 06:10.578
have been trying to steal the midterms

06:10.828 --> 06:13.498
by crawling your phones,

06:13.581 --> 06:16.125
invading your privacy

06:16.626 --> 06:19.087
and telling you how to vote.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.923
Now, are you gonna
let them get away with it?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.758
No!

06:23.841 --> 06:26.052
We need to tell them to wake up!

06:26.135 --> 06:27.970
Say it with me, Lebanon, Kansas.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.014
It is time for Congress to...

06:30.098 --> 06:31.432
Wake up!

06:31.808 --> 06:34.227
And it's time for the Supreme Court to...

06:34.310 --> 06:36.062
Wake up!

06:36.437 --> 06:40.733
Now, my purpose is to elevate America,

06:40.817 --> 06:42.693
<i>fight for America,</i>

06:42.777 --> 06:46.280
<i>and if it ever came to it,
die for America.</i>

06:46.739 --> 06:51.244
<i>I will be father, mother, leader
and friend.</i>

06:51.327 --> 06:52.703
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

07:00.420 --> 07:02.547
Father, mother, leader...

07:05.258 --> 07:07.760
liar, killer.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.949
Rest in peace, Rachel.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.491
<i>When's the footage from?</i>

07:44.547 --> 07:46.048
<i>It's from several days ago.</i>

07:46.132 --> 07:49.969
<i>He's been staying at a cabin.
Childhood cabin for three or four weeks.</i>

07:50.052 --> 07:52.972
<i>We suspect he's in the mountains
outside Los Cerillos now.</i>

07:53.055 --> 07:54.640
And did he find where he buried her?

07:54.724 --> 07:55.725
<i>We're still not sure.</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:58.227
<i>Ma'am, I got a tip from a former agent.</i>

07:58.311 --> 08:01.772
One of the ones poking around Gaffney
on behalf of the Shepherds.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.400
<i>Doug recently reached out to Seth Grayson.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:06.777
Do we know what was discussed?

08:06.861 --> 08:11.073
<i>No, but it's the first time he's contacted
anyone connected with the Shepherds</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:13.201
<i>since you last spoke to him.</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:18.748
Well, if he's trying to get caught,
let's catch him.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.088
So is Duncan Shepherd testifying or not?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.049
His lawyers are negotiating the terms.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.468
They're hoping that he could meet
behind closed doors.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.803
Well, then he needs to be subpoenaed.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.323
Every congressperson we've spoken to

08:34.347 --> 08:36.408
- agrees he should be and yet...
- They're delaying.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.393
I mean, there's no real desire
to move this app investigation along.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.937
They're protecting their own.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.688
The House asked for these hearings.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.816
The theatre is good for them.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.527
But we are in constant contact

08:47.610 --> 08:49.650
with the Democratic members
of the committee, ma'am.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.855
They're feeling the pressure.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.824
Well, clearly, not enough.
We can start arresting congresspeople.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.628
Pull them out of the chambers
if we have to.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.913
- The whole point of the hearings...
- Is what? Obfuscation?

08:59.497 --> 09:02.542
What? We're talking about invasion
of privacy here.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.461
The US Attorney is resistant
to pressing any kind of charges

09:05.545 --> 09:08.297
- without hard evidence.
- The app is the evidence.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.676
- This is grounds for prosecution, Nora.
<i>- </i> Yes, maybe.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.720
- But the US Attorney would argue...
- Replace the US Attorney.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.474
She's been dragging her feet
on this for months.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.603
Ma'am, we still live in a world
of due process.

09:22.687 --> 09:26.247
- That would send a chilling message...
<i>- </i> The message is we need to protect our democracy.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.536
On a practical note,
we're canceling the fourth stop today.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.541
Upon reflection, we decided Toledo
would be redundant with Cleveland.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.835
Pam, it's fine. You can be honest.

09:46.627 --> 09:50.715
The Commander In Chief is feeling
a little woozy today. That's all.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.469
And yes, maybe a little cranky,
but nothing serious. I promise.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.349
When we touch down in Des Moines,

10:00.433 --> 10:03.311
Nora, you can head straight back to DC.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.826
Is it Slavic, "Skorsky"?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.872
Polish, in my case.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.207
You must be lonely.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.005
I asked the press corps
to take the second plane,

10:31.088 --> 10:33.716
so that you and I could meet privately.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.720
Four months ago, you met with two people.

10:39.221 --> 10:43.017
One of them's missing
and one of them is dead.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.813
My life has certainly been punctuated
with loss lately.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.733
And just a bit of great luck.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.235
Tom Hammerschmidt was not lucky.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.821
No, he wasn't. That was tragic.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.659
That's why I think
you should pick up his mantle.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.245
And tell the full story
of Francis' political career.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.997
Are you messing with me?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.666
No. Far from it.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.293
You did a great job investigating
and exposing

11:09.377 --> 11:11.587
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.131
Its nefarious uses.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.260
We can't let congresspeople get away
with things like that.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.847
I wonder if you'll get them in line

11:21.931 --> 11:24.684
before the Supreme Court
takes your power away.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.355
Tom Hammerschmidt and I,
the last time we spoke,

11:29.438 --> 11:30.564
we talked about my husband.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.859
And my hope is
I could pick it up with you.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.899
I have a lot that needs to be said about
Francis, his crimes and misdemeanors.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.285
You want my story or don't you?

11:45.871 --> 11:46.871
Oh.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.376
Oh, it's these mini contractions.

11:50.459 --> 11:54.463
They're, um... called Braxton Hicks.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.798
Do you have kids?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.050
No, I don't.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.846
Oh, the baby's really moving now.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.348
It's kicking. Do you want to feel?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
No, thank you.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.644
Such a strange feeling.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.234
To be wholly responsible
for the life of another.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.864
Also, I hear,
when you have kids, you never...

12:20.656 --> 12:22.742
sleep quite the same again.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.329
There are two kinds of pain.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.295
Doug Stamper sent me that text,

12:36.130 --> 12:38.591
he said it comes
from your husband's diary.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.596
Now, I ask you,

12:44.597 --> 12:48.726
who should I interview, you or him?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.748
I know that some of you are here

12:53.814 --> 12:56.817
because you're not sure I'm gonna be
around at next year's gathering.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.611
Oh, no, no, I can see it on...

12:59.528 --> 13:01.614
On your faces. And it's true.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.410
These last few months,
I've had to look back.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.956
But I'm excited. I am.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.959
As my sister told you,

13:14.043 --> 13:18.172
there are changes coming to this country
in the next few months.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.759
The kind that I haven't been able
to accomplish

13:21.842 --> 13:24.303
in the 20 plus years
that I've been at it.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.183
It'll cut regulation for the people,
give every man a chance.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.519
You lead a man to fish, and he...

13:32.228 --> 13:36.398
You want to lock me up in prison
for that, then so be it, but...

13:37.024 --> 13:39.568
Seize my assets. Hmm.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.698
Did you read...

13:48.244 --> 13:51.580
finches dream?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.460
Yeah, yeah.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.712
They can... They have the...

13:59.547 --> 14:02.299
They can sing to themselves
when they sleep.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.885
Where was I?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.054
I have congressmen who want to break away.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.723
Separate themselves from this.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.143
Well, deflect and compliment.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.979
That's how I survived the Hill.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.107
...republic, army of clerks...

14:18.816 --> 14:21.402
These hearings will blow up on us, Mark.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.489
Now, one way or another,
we all used that motherfucking app.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.368
And yes, they've been good to us, but...

14:30.661 --> 14:33.581
why do we all have to pay
for what the son set in motion?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.334
Anything you want to say about Duncan,
you say it to Annette.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.961
Well, I'm asking you to say it.

14:43.465 --> 14:47.052
I can't believe I'm looking to you
for help again all these years later.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.017
You were vice president.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.647
I've rebuilt my career
at least three times, Brett.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.526
And I will continue to do so
as long as I have to.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.239
Too bad Jane Davis won't have that chance.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.911
"What I am to Claire
is not what I am to Zoe."

15:12.703 --> 15:14.079
Do you know what it means?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.874
Does he believe you should know
what it means?

15:16.957 --> 15:21.003
Yes. He added,
"And that's what he left me..."

15:21.921 --> 15:24.173
It belongs to some diary
that Francis kept.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.106
But not part of his presidential papers?

15:26.133 --> 15:29.178
Whatever it is, it's information
that President Underwood...

15:29.720 --> 15:32.473
President Hale wants kept out
of the light.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.060
Doug implied that she got pregnant

15:36.143 --> 15:38.604
so as to keep him
from what was rightfully his.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.665
When will you speak with him next?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.692
My guess is the next time
he finds a payphone or a burner.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.861
I'd like to meet with him.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.831
- Annette.
- You're going to be famous, Brett.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.333
Well, there's fame...

16:00.918 --> 16:02.461
and then there's notoriety.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.214
The bill you had your name on
all those months ago...

16:06.215 --> 16:07.716
will be upheld in the Supreme Court.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.011
This is Judge Abruzzo's majority ruling.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.933
- How did you...
- We helped him write it.

16:17.184 --> 16:21.063
It's worded in such a way
that her powers will be diminished...

16:21.939 --> 16:24.108
over time and across the board.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.861
Mark gave you a sense
of what we're thinking?

16:27.945 --> 16:28.945
A bit.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.843
You just need to run out
the clock on these hearings.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.868
After the midterms,
you can send a powerful message.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.127
Over the years, we've been lucky enough
to support an array of talented

16:43.210 --> 16:44.753
and like-minded politicians.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.548
We've essentially operated
like a third party.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.883
And one day,

16:49.967 --> 16:53.095
in the not too distant future,
we'll make it official.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.015
Brett, you will be the leader
of that party.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.976
You'll be our man in the White House.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.104
I told Brett how thankful we are

17:02.896 --> 17:05.065
for keeping Duncan out of the spotlight.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.109
I won't forget all you've done for him.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.896
<i>Well, that's actually
a very good question, Bob.</i>

17:11.946 --> 17:14.616
Where do we rank
as a country in the world?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.952
You have to ask that. We're 17.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.997
That's where we are. 17th.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.915
- That is a disgrace...
- Speaking of disgrace,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.044
I have a question for you, sir.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.212
Did your family make you sick

17:27.628 --> 17:30.049
with their chemical plants
and their toxic sites?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.383
Get her out of here.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.135
You made yourself sick.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.031
- And you're killing all of us.
- Somebody take care of this young lady.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.016
Of course he's going to take me out.
You're killing all of us.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.272
<i>"I'm not gonna lie, I despise children.</i>

17:45.355 --> 17:47.024
<i>There, I've said it."</i>

17:47.107 --> 17:48.609
What the hell is wrong with you?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.944
"Thirty minutes ago I received a text
from Zoe.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.114
- She intends to apologize, no doubt."
- Wait, wait, what's that from?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.449
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

17:56.700 --> 17:58.994
Doug, come here. Let's meet.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.621
<i>"Rebellion on all fronts..."</i>

18:00.704 --> 18:04.416
"Claire, Zoe, Russo.
I must not lose my resolve."

18:04.500 --> 18:06.293
Hey, stop. Where are you?

18:06.376 --> 18:09.797
<i>No, no, no.
That's not how this is gonna work.</i>

18:11.673 --> 18:14.301
Doug, we can find you.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.594
<i>It won't take very long.</i>

18:15.677 --> 18:17.304
I'll tell you where I am right now.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.848
Right in the middle of nowhere.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.505
I'm five minutes from out of here
and out of fucking mind.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.937
She just wants to sit with you.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.815
I'm going to tell you what I want said
and how.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.694
They have the lawyers, the money.
I don't.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.363
<i>They do what I tell them,</i>

18:35.405 --> 18:36.740
<i>then I know we can meet.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:40.702
You will get everything that you are due.
I'll make sure of it.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.124
When will I hear from you again?

18:58.428 --> 19:01.181
I'm so sorry that they called you
onto the plane, Dr. Larson.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.641
I feel fine now.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.726
All the same,
you're getting close to a time

19:04.810 --> 19:07.563
where jumping on and off a plane
may not be the best idea.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.690
You said you'd been feeling run down.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.109
- Yes, a little bit. But...
- I think we should get

19:12.192 --> 19:14.903
you back to DC to do some blood work
as a precaution.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.530
Okay, that's fine.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.075
But unless I'm putting the baby in danger,

19:20.951 --> 19:22.995
I've got two more appearances today.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.705
I'd advise against that.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.543
I cannot be the indisposed president,
Dr. Larson.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.627
I'm sure you're fine,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.921
but your sample tells me
you're a bit dehydrated.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.257
At least let me get you on an IV.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.633
It won't take long.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.927
We'll get your fluids back to normal.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.598
Is this really necessary?

19:42.931 --> 19:44.266
He's a grown man.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.269
If you'd rather have Seth bring me
the signed documents that's fine, too.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.395
Annie, you have to admit

19:48.478 --> 19:51.732
- this is the most cockamamie thing...
- That's Dad's word.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.109
And please don't confuse me with someone

19:54.193 --> 19:57.404
who's willing to listen to one more
of your goddamn opinions.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.948
Each of us will legally adopt him.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.409
And when we're dead and gone,
it will be Duncan...

20:03.869 --> 20:07.748
who is the face, voice and embodiment
of Shepherd Unlimited.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.419
I'm doing this for you.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
- I'm late.
- I'm signing.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.639
Is it your plan to keep avoiding me?

20:23.722 --> 20:27.392
- Bill.
- Lordy, what exactly is it I did to you?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.394
You think you know what's best for me.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.230
I am not our father.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.565
Would have been swell
if you'd realized that sooner.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.489
So glad you got to spend some time
with your friends like this, Bill.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.038
I can't get that woman out of my head.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.667
Do you think she was right?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.337
Did we poison ourselves?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.515
Is Abruzzo impeachable? Yes.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.309
Would the Senate convict him?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.270
Who knows?

21:11.812 --> 21:13.272
But what does it matter?

21:14.147 --> 21:16.984
You need him scared, and this might do it.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.903
He received an interest-free loan

21:19.987 --> 21:23.824
from a Shepherd-owned entity
for a lake house at the same time

21:24.324 --> 21:27.828
that he was ruling on a case that involved
another part of that company.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.539
Is everything all right?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.003
Yes. Sorry.
I'm just a little bit dehydrated.

21:36.545 --> 21:40.590
Why hasn't this ever come up before,
Walter?

21:40.674 --> 21:43.093
Abruzzo was never fully-vetted.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.429
By you, by anybody.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.557
In a way, the fact that
he was railroaded through

21:48.640 --> 21:51.184
has proved
to be your opportunity.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.687
And the rest of the court?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.355
Locked in.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.442
Abruzzo's the swing vote.

21:59.526 --> 22:02.070
We at the Shepherd Freedom Foundation,

22:02.154 --> 22:04.323
freedom being the operative word there,

22:04.406 --> 22:06.033
believe in the individual.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.661
I could argue that our foundation is

22:09.745 --> 22:13.248
more inclusive, more forward-looking

22:13.332 --> 22:16.126
than any so-called progressive agenda.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.628
Oh, listen.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.634
Listen to you. You are so programmed
that you can't hear my argument.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.431
Nathan. I wish I could help you.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.477
Withholding information from
an ongoing investigation is a crime.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.355
If you know anything
about his whereabouts,

22:36.438 --> 22:37.439
suggest you tell me.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.242
What are you gonna do
when all this is over?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.318
I mean, think about it.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.488
How long before you become the one
with too many secrets?

22:44.946 --> 22:46.823
Our president scares me.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.535
If anyone knows
what she's been up to, it's you.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.329
You have children, right?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.081
How many wives?

22:54.414 --> 22:55.874
Leave them out of it.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.834
Can you?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.712
My father was a cop.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.714
My mom's a widow.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.259
It's a hard life, Nathan.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.930
All those years at the Bureau.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.016
The time you put in,
all that experience, it's valuable.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.352
Where's Doug?

23:16.728 --> 23:18.230
The thing about these events,

23:18.647 --> 23:20.107
there's cameras everywhere.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.190
Seth.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.403
No, because this is where
I turn to the camera.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
And I say,

23:27.406 --> 23:28.448
I don't know.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.871
<i>I'm sad to say, but there is
a Russian troll factory</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:38.792
<i>that has begun to manipulate
your husband's accomplishments.</i>

23:38.875 --> 23:40.043
That's awful.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.588
<i>No. We caught them. But for instance,</i>

23:43.713 --> 23:48.260
<i>records of his years at Harvard,</i>
<i>his years at the </i> Sentinel,

23:48.844 --> 23:51.638
<i>are virtually impossible to track down.</i>

23:51.721 --> 23:55.392
<i>Now, instead you find fabrications
about him.</i>

23:55.475 --> 23:58.353
<i>They filled the air with noise,
so to speak.</i>

23:59.229 --> 24:02.482
<i>I know from last we spoke,
you were concerned</i>

24:02.566 --> 24:04.401
<i>something like this could happen.</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:06.153
Well, I was.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.596
That someone had mentioned the possibility
to me. But I had no idea it could be done.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.576
<i>We have unfortunately entered an era</i>

24:12.659 --> 24:16.788
<i>where our digital truths are vulnerable.</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:18.248
In that case,

24:18.331 --> 24:22.294
couldn't these trolls amplify
my husband's crimes as well?

24:22.377 --> 24:23.545
<i>Yes.</i>

24:24.921 --> 24:28.508
<i>And those would be
very difficult stories to take back.</i>

24:28.592 --> 24:31.428
Viktor, that would be terrible
if that were to happen.

24:32.512 --> 24:36.766
<i>History belongs to the highest bidder now.</i>

24:36.850 --> 24:40.479
Well, I hope his reputation
can survive his crimes.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.315
And I hope...

24:45.442 --> 24:48.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.239
<i>Claire, something wrong?</i>

24:51.323 --> 24:53.217
<i>- How's she doing?
- She's tachycardiac</i>

24:53.241 --> 24:55.577
<i>with elevated respirations,
Q5 contractions.</i>

24:56.203 --> 24:58.455
You're 26 weeks pregnant, Madam President.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.292
We need to give her four grams of mag.
Start the drip.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.005
<i>Francis Underwood?</i>

25:09.591 --> 25:11.426
<i>Francis Underwood.</i>

25:14.763 --> 25:16.431
<i>Francis Underwood?</i>

25:17.807 --> 25:19.809
Why do you say his name like that?

25:20.435 --> 25:22.103
Why would you get engaged?

25:22.437 --> 25:23.855
I'm not engaged.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.943
- Gretchen said...
- Gretchen should mind her own business.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.205
I haven't answered him yet.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.499
The sex can't be great with him,

25:42.832 --> 25:44.417
it just can't.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.128
The sex is great with you.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.177
I thought we were gonna
fuck our way across Europe

25:54.261 --> 25:57.722
and China and Africa or wherever.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.475
Hmm. Who says we won't?

26:03.979 --> 26:06.565
- Francis fucking Underwood.
- Reed. Would you stop?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.358
I mean, come on. The guy's not your type.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.068
Oh, because you are?

26:12.737 --> 26:16.199
I'm your parents' type.
But I wouldn't be if they really knew me.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.119
Which I guess is another way
of saying yes.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.204
- I am your type.
- Hmm.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.708
Francis is the patron saint of animals.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.296
He never stops talking. Every time
I see that guy, his mouth is running.

26:29.629 --> 26:33.425
Because he always has an audience
and you never know what he's going to say.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.263
Claire Hale.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.017
What do you want?

26:48.815 --> 26:49.816
What?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.408
I want...

27:00.994 --> 27:02.871
every door to be wide open

27:06.625 --> 27:08.251
and stay that way.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.632
Then call him...

27:14.716 --> 27:17.385
and tell him it's over,
because you're coming with me.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.055
I am?

28:27.414 --> 28:29.332
Hi, Francis, it's me.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.669
I'm five minutes away.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.138
<i>Someone will have to get
to the bottom of it, Madam President.</i>

28:43.596 --> 28:44.597
I mean...

28:45.098 --> 28:47.142
Pitocin induces labor.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.686
She'll never practice again.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.232
Is the baby gonna be okay?

28:55.024 --> 28:56.526
The baby is fine.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.654
Here we go.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.284
Would you like to know the sex?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.166
Hello.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.265
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.

29:56.544 --> 30:00.173
I'm coming for you, Claire.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.992
I'm not gonna run, Nathan.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.760
35 degrees, 28 minutes,
22 seconds north,

30:45.844 --> 30:49.389
by a 106 degrees,
8 minutes, 58 seconds west.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.767
What are you talking about?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.397
It's where Rachel Posner is buried.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.694
Let me ask you something, Nathan.

31:04.487 --> 31:05.822
After all this time.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.742
All these years together.
Everything that we did for Frank.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.703
Stuff with Lucas,

31:11.911 --> 31:13.121
Macallan,

31:13.788 --> 31:15.331
the terrorist kid.

31:17.250 --> 31:21.045
Everything we ever did. Are you seriously
telling me, you're gonna choose her?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.802
Literally, all I care about
is getting out of this alive.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.599
Get in.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.110
How is it possible
we still haven't found him?

31:44.193 --> 31:46.112
<i>Last time anybody saw him,</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:48.031
he was in New Mexico
near a border checkpoint.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.908
<i>You honestly believe he's out
of the country?</i>

31:49.991 --> 31:53.620
<i>It just doesn't fit, Nathan.
It's not like him to leave.</i>

31:53.703 --> 31:56.539
When's the last time he had contact
with the Shepherds?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.041
<i>I gather he did convey</i>

31:58.124 --> 32:00.293
a few more curious quotes to Mr. Grayson.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.211
But at this point, the feeling is

32:02.295 --> 32:04.797
<i>they're like the ravings
of a crazy person.</i>

32:06.215 --> 32:08.551
We'll speak later.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.598
How did he get...

32:17.727 --> 32:20.229
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.441
I will not reap...

32:24.150 --> 32:26.277
what your father has sown.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.902
Is everything all right, Madam President?

34:18.139 --> 34:19.181
Yes.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.684
I was just looking for something.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.106
Ma'am, Congressman Cole's here.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.150
Shall I send him in?

34:29.942 --> 34:30.942
Yes.

34:33.987 --> 34:35.989
- Madam President.
- Brett.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.786
I wonder if you would do me a favor.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.413
The George Washington painting.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.248
Would you mind hanging that back up
over the mantle?

34:46.208 --> 34:47.418
No.

35:02.642 --> 35:06.687
Thank you so much and thank you
for coming. Please have a seat.

35:09.607 --> 35:14.278
Now, the Shepherds started
backing you when?

35:15.321 --> 35:19.700
Was that during or after your tragic
affair with the poor young woman?

35:22.912 --> 35:26.916
My wife knows about the affair.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.978
- There was no way I could have predicted...
- Don't worry.

35:30.002 --> 35:33.214
I wasn't planning on using that
nasty little piece of business.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.551
I just wanted to gauge
how long this was going to take.

35:37.718 --> 35:40.054
So, putting the Senate aside,

35:40.138 --> 35:43.224
how many members of the House
were using that app?

35:44.559 --> 35:46.060
Ballpark figure is fine.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.938
That's what our judiciary hearings
are trying to determine.

35:49.021 --> 35:52.275
I'll go straight to arrests if I have to.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.194
This is treason, Brett.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.780
Somebody will go down for it.

35:57.864 --> 36:01.325
So, I guess the real question is will you?

36:03.077 --> 36:05.705
Because I know the chair in this room
that you're gunning for

36:05.788 --> 36:08.374
is not the one your ass
is currently warming.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.920
Forgive me.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.965
I think pregnancy
has brought out the sailor in me.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.259
So.

36:18.926 --> 36:22.138
What you're going to say to the press
as soon as this meeting is over.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.099
You're going to say
that you asked to meet with me

36:25.141 --> 36:28.519
so that you could report
some good old-fashioned quid pro quo

36:28.603 --> 36:30.313
that came to your attention.

36:30.396 --> 36:35.276
That my recent Supreme Court appointee

36:35.651 --> 36:37.904
was found trading

36:37.987 --> 36:41.073
a favorable ruling for a lake house.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.325
Shocking.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.327
And that you and I both knew

36:44.410 --> 36:48.289
that the only choice you then had
was to go to congress and initiate...

36:48.372 --> 36:50.499
No Supreme Court justice
has ever been impeached.

36:51.834 --> 36:55.004
The good Justice Abruzzo wouldn't want
to be the first then, would he?

36:55.630 --> 36:57.173
Justice Abruzzo...

36:58.382 --> 36:59.467
is black.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.552
Which makes this all the more...

37:02.220 --> 37:03.679
There's that word again,

37:04.388 --> 37:05.473
tragic.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.945
Madam President.

37:19.028 --> 37:23.950
Before you explain to me how we shouldn't
be meeting or how Brett shouldn't be here,

37:24.033 --> 37:25.868
separation of branches and all that.

37:25.952 --> 37:29.121
We are considering a case
that will directly affect

37:29.205 --> 37:30.831
the office of the presidency.

37:30.915 --> 37:36.712
I know, a case based on the monumental
piece of legislation co-signed by Brett.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.759
But the three of us standing here
right now have nothing to do with that.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.679
Isn't that right, Congressman?

37:46.055 --> 37:47.431
Yes, Madam President.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.434
I'll let the speaker explain.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.104
'Cause you have a number of options
to consider.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.357
And I want you to know how
truly embarrassing it is for me.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.651
The sad fate of my choice for the court.

38:03.155 --> 38:06.701
And by the way, I love Lake Champlain.

38:07.743 --> 38:11.622
I've only been there twice,
but I'll never forget the thrilling shock

38:11.706 --> 38:13.457
of the cold water on my feet.

38:14.083 --> 38:17.837
My grandson has MS. He needs to swim.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.757
Oh. I don't judge, Justice Abruzzo.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.511
I'll correct that. Except for mendacity.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.931
That I can't support.

38:29.849 --> 38:33.894
And, Brett, when you report this back
to the Shepherds,

38:35.688 --> 38:37.064
give them my best.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.615
As a Shepherd, it's your duty
to give back to the arts

38:46.699 --> 38:48.284
and the communities you're involved in.

38:48.743 --> 38:52.413
You know, everything we've ever done
at Gardner Analytics is to serve the user.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.248
You've made that clear, yes.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.932
And yet, you were aware of the amount of data
the user was essentially signing over to you.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.379
<i>No more than any other application.</i>

39:00.463 --> 39:03.191
<i>But the White House is saying
that the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app</i>

39:03.215 --> 39:04.884
<i>went beyond any other application.</i>

39:04.967 --> 39:07.967
<i>That it allowed congressional campaigns
complete access to the user's phone.</i>

39:08.387 --> 39:11.766
Some are even saying that the app
is essentially mining peoples' psyches.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.602
Look.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.729
<i>You design the thing,
but at the end of the day,</i>

39:16.812 --> 39:19.023
<i>you have no idea how it will be used.</i>

39:19.106 --> 39:20.106
Mr. Shepherd.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.111
Could you excuse me
for one moment, please?

39:26.739 --> 39:28.866
I'm Agent Slater with the FBI.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.531
What's this about?

39:31.577 --> 39:32.661
Please come with us.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.598
I'm not going anywhere
until I call my lawyer.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.165
Mr. Shepherd, please.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.167
It'd be best if you cooperated.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.717
Abruzzo is recusing himself.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.219
On what grounds?

39:48.719 --> 39:50.346
His conflict of interest.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.808
This is about the future
of the presidency.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.893
He's using his military service.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.437
Get him over here.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.732
It's too late, he can't reverse himself.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.903
I decide when it's too late.
I will not have that ruling upheld.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.364
Who else can we get to?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.159
Barry.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.495
<i>Annette, do not turn on the TV.</i>

40:15.121 --> 40:16.539
What are you talking about?

40:16.622 --> 40:19.417
<i>They took him.
They came in with a warrant.</i>

40:20.251 --> 40:21.585
What do you mean they took him?

40:21.669 --> 40:25.089
<i>They're using his work with the app
as grounds to charge him with treason.</i>

40:25.172 --> 40:27.508
<i>I promise you,
we will do everything we can.</i>

40:27.591 --> 40:30.719
<i>But anyone connected with the app
is distancing themselves from it</i>

40:30.803 --> 40:31.971
<i>and you.</i>

40:38.102 --> 40:39.687
It's finally here.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.554
Where did these changes come from?

40:48.612 --> 40:50.531
Directly from the Shepherd family.

40:51.365 --> 40:52.450
His mother?

40:52.533 --> 40:54.910
Look, just do your thing.
Let's get it on tape.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.169
Nazi-like tactics?

41:03.752 --> 41:07.381
You bring up Nazis in any situation
other than the Second World War,

41:07.465 --> 41:09.133
you've already lost the argument.

41:09.216 --> 41:11.844
I mean, come on, we all knew
what Duncan was doing.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.637
Is anybody really surprised?

41:13.721 --> 41:15.181
- I mean, really?
- Melody...

41:22.271 --> 41:23.481
What?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.942
- What are you...
- No.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.696
She's polling in the high 70s.

41:30.779 --> 41:33.699
We're looking at close to 80
by the midterms.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.701
The anti-corporate rant

41:35.784 --> 41:36.994
is gaining traction.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.163
She's weaponized her feminism,

41:39.872 --> 41:41.582
and it's grown tiresome.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.293
"I'm a mother, I'm a general."

41:44.710 --> 41:45.878
Spare me.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.881
Anyone that popular is bad for democracy.

41:49.965 --> 41:50.965
Mark.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.427
So, the pros.

41:54.637 --> 41:57.681
After her death,
with the vice presidency vacant,

41:58.807 --> 42:00.768
our friend Brett Cole will be president.

42:01.310 --> 42:06.440
We suspect we'll get a call for stability
and unity.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.236
Heal the nation, we all know the drill.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.489
The cons. We're gonna
take a hit in the midterms.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.366
I think we hold on to the House.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.284
The Senate is a long shot.

42:18.118 --> 42:21.038
The markets will fluctuate for a while.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.165
I've brought Lorraine in for that.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.293
She's got some impressive
computer models and projections. But...

42:27.086 --> 42:29.171
all in all, we're confident we can absorb

42:29.255 --> 42:33.133
whatever financial hit an assassination
would have on the economy.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.678
We're talking about a quarter point loss

42:35.761 --> 42:37.721
in the GDP, at the most.

42:38.180 --> 42:41.016
And what about all the conspiracy nonsense
we'll be hearing?

42:41.475 --> 42:44.103
The theories are a useful distraction.

42:44.645 --> 42:48.649
And eventually, they consume themselves.
History will back us up on that.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.651
There's one hiccup. It's a big one.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.862
She's with child.

42:53.946 --> 42:59.243
That is a variable we don't know how
to account for in our models or predict.

42:59.326 --> 43:02.246
We use it. Play into it.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.582
We'll make her a martyr.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.084
A victim of the times.

43:07.167 --> 43:08.752
A feminist icon.

43:09.753 --> 43:13.299
God, she might even end up on a coin.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.677
As long as another Zapruder
doesn't show up.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.429
Jack, that's not funny.

43:19.722 --> 43:22.391
Well, that's as much as I want to know.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.978
Yes, I think it's best
if you all leave now.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.938
I'll take it from here.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.783
Bring him in.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.083
It's 11 o'clock, as they say.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.546
You want what I have.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.884
Actually, I want you to hold on to it.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.846
I told Seth, and I'll tell you again.

44:43.597 --> 44:46.892
I want to bring her down, but not Francis.

44:47.559 --> 44:49.603
Don't you know that's impossible?

44:50.020 --> 44:51.563
Even if she killed her husband?

44:51.897 --> 44:52.898
Doug...

44:54.024 --> 44:56.694
my goal and yours have become the same.

44:59.279 --> 45:00.948
Does she call you Doug?

45:01.865 --> 45:04.368
Or does she do that Francis thing of hers.

45:05.911 --> 45:07.204
Douglas.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.415
You know what we need to do.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.959
You keep mistaking me for someone I'm not.

45:13.001 --> 45:15.170
I don't care about you or what you want.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.922
But you do care what Frank wanted.

45:17.589 --> 45:21.468
And it's time you admitted it.
Frank wanted her dead.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.930
This seems too personal for you.

45:25.013 --> 45:29.393
All politics is personal.
You of all people know that.

45:30.477 --> 45:32.312
And you want her dead, too.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.733
And neither one of us can do it alone.

45:47.703 --> 45:49.580
You'll come to your senses soon.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.332
You're no fool.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.419
You want to protect what he left you?

45:56.044 --> 45:57.296
It's the only way.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.646
Congratulations on the ruling coming out
of the court.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.440
They still haven't decided.

46:16.523 --> 46:18.650
But we all know how it's going to go.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.070
Please, sit down.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.742
Nora Cafferty...

46:27.951 --> 46:29.161
has a secret.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.247
Excuse me.

46:32.831 --> 46:35.626
I assume you were worried
about the scare with the baby.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.754
I spoke to President Petrov.

46:38.837 --> 46:43.091
He's informed me that ICO
is trying to acquire a nuclear device.

46:44.593 --> 46:46.637
Yes. They are.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.263
So why didn't you tell me?

46:51.225 --> 46:55.562
I have full confidence in you, Nora,
and your abilities, but this concerns me.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.566
You cannot under any circumstances

47:00.025 --> 47:03.445
withhold information that is essential
to our national security.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.491
I had such high hopes for you.

47:08.742 --> 47:09.993
I'm sorry.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.332
I didn't want to have to say this.

47:16.750 --> 47:19.336
I was hoping the Supreme Court
would rule against you.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.713
That they would take away the football.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.842
And I'm not the only one
who's starting to feel it.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.683
This is my house, and I want you out.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.912
She's ready to condemn her husband.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.332
So why aren't you?

48:04.548 --> 48:06.884
It wasn't a thief who killed Tom.

48:12.681 --> 48:13.682
No.

48:14.349 --> 48:16.310
- I don't think it was.
- Look,

48:16.810 --> 48:20.022
- Tom and I were working on...
- Okay, I know what he was working on.

48:22.816 --> 48:26.528
It took me almost a month to find it,
but it was on his dog's collar.

48:26.612 --> 48:29.865
It was the same thing
Lucas was working on and Zoe before that.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.451
Always with the same problem,

48:32.534 --> 48:34.578
no one will believe it.

48:34.661 --> 48:38.665
- Look, I laid it out for him...
- Without any evidence.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.169
Or do you have any?

48:48.091 --> 48:51.345
All there is, is your word. And what
is that even worth these days?

48:53.764 --> 48:56.767
I mean, what the hell are you protecting?

49:05.233 --> 49:07.653
I can keep driving. I don't mind.

49:09.780 --> 49:14.701
Or you can help me finish the story
of Tom, Lucas, Zoe, you

49:14.785 --> 49:15.827
and...

49:17.579 --> 49:18.789
maybe me.

49:27.506 --> 49:30.258
I tested you. And you passed.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.053
That's basically how I see it,
Madam President.

49:33.136 --> 49:36.181
You're impertinent.
That was clear from the start.

49:36.264 --> 49:37.766
No, I'm ambitious.

49:38.433 --> 49:41.728
Which is something that I've always
admired, from afar, about you.

49:41.812 --> 49:45.482
Even when you were attacking me?

49:45.565 --> 49:48.819
Forgive me.
I become aggressive when I'm nervous.

49:48.902 --> 49:50.195
It's always been that way.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.364
Can we start over?

49:52.948 --> 49:54.616
Because I think I finally understand you

49:54.700 --> 49:56.535
and what you're trying to do
for this country.

49:56.910 --> 49:58.787
I can help you get your message out.

50:00.038 --> 50:01.039
Sure.

50:03.166 --> 50:05.269
- All right, settle, people.
- Okay, let's begin.

50:05.293 --> 50:08.296
Let's go in four, three, two...

50:09.548 --> 50:10.632
First things first.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.719
Despite what the odds-makers have decided,

50:14.219 --> 50:17.055
I am going to be the mother
of a baby girl.

50:17.139 --> 50:20.017
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.435
And have you picked out a name?

50:21.768 --> 50:23.353
Um, not yet.

50:24.229 --> 50:27.190
I need to see her face first.

50:29.234 --> 50:33.196
What do you most wish
the American people knew about you?

50:34.948 --> 50:36.241
Something surprising.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.704
That I like nothing more than to laugh.

50:41.329 --> 50:44.249
And what does the prospect
of becoming a mother,

50:44.666 --> 50:48.045
while being the leader of the free world,
feel like?

50:48.670 --> 50:49.921
Bittersweet.

50:50.756 --> 50:54.593
I didn't expect to deliver Francis' child
as a widow, of course.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.680
But I have things to do

50:58.764 --> 51:02.059
for my unborn child,
for this unformed nation.

51:02.434 --> 51:06.980
I want to create
a progressive and productive Hale legacy

51:07.064 --> 51:08.273
for the ages.

51:08.356 --> 51:09.775
Speaking of which.

51:10.233 --> 51:11.943
Why did you return to your maiden name?

51:12.027 --> 51:13.987
Well, I think your question
answered itself.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.322
Maiden name.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.742
The assumptions behind that expression

51:19.242 --> 51:22.662
led me back to what I can only call
my name.

51:24.247 --> 51:25.582
President Hale,

51:26.541 --> 51:28.001
why the delay

51:28.085 --> 51:31.338
in nominating a replacement
for the vice presidential vacancy?

51:31.797 --> 51:34.382
Two reasons. One, constitutionally,

51:34.466 --> 51:36.384
Congress needs to confirm the choice

51:36.468 --> 51:40.347
<i>and our current Congress is dirty.</i>

51:41.765 --> 51:44.017
<i>We'll have to see what happens
with the midterms.</i>

51:44.101 --> 51:45.435
<i>And two,</i>

51:46.144 --> 51:48.688
<i>if I've learned anything
from partnerships,</i>

51:49.356 --> 51:51.149
<i>you have to choose someone</i>

51:51.650 --> 51:53.276
<i>who'd take a bullet for you.</i>

51:54.444 --> 51:57.072
<i>And, Melody, I'd like
to come clean on something.</i>

51:57.155 --> 51:58.156
<i>Please.</i>

51:59.950 --> 52:02.202
<i>The truth is, and it pains me to say this,</i>

52:02.285 --> 52:04.204
<i>but the truth is, this country</i>

52:04.287 --> 52:07.207
<i>never got to know
the real Francis Underwood.</i>

52:07.290 --> 52:10.168
<i>I'm not sure I ever
really knew him myself.</i>

52:12.754 --> 52:14.422
<i>I know you saw it, too.</i>

52:14.965 --> 52:18.135
<i>He was impossible to know,
like all con men.</i>

52:19.219 --> 52:20.971
<i>He played us all.</i>

52:22.931 --> 52:24.432
<i>Come and get me, Doug.</i>

53:12.564 --> 53:14.232
She leaves me no choice.

53:15.305 --> 53:21.863
