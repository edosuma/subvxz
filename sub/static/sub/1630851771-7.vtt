WEBVTT

00:00.626 --> 00:03.250
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.083
All right, we've gotta start
making a move on the...

00:05.083 --> 00:06.417
We don't need to go that fast.

00:06.417 --> 00:07.417
This is our job, isn't it?

00:07.417 --> 00:09.667
Go ahead and drop fenders.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.083
Oh, man, we lost a cover.

00:11.083 --> 00:12.542
Mother----er.

00:12.542 --> 00:14.417
Sorry about that, Cap.

00:14.417 --> 00:16.167
It's just little things
like that show Wes' inexperience

00:16.167 --> 00:17.501
on a mega yacht.

00:17.501 --> 00:19.626
The wind here is just
too ----ing strong.

00:19.626 --> 00:21.125
I'm sick of it all.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.876
I don't want another
----ing thing

00:22.876 --> 00:24.542
falling off this boat, copy?

00:24.542 --> 00:25.542
-Yes.
-Copy.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.918
How is Jess doing?

00:26.918 --> 00:28.918
Her spirits just
always seem down.

00:28.918 --> 00:31.042
[bleep] you, seam!

00:31.042 --> 00:34.209
She's just, like, moping around
as if, like, she's pure misery.

00:34.209 --> 00:36.209
Right.

00:36.209 --> 00:37.250
And it's just everything she
does, there's a sigh before it,

00:37.250 --> 00:38.501
and I'm not gonna keep trying

00:38.501 --> 00:39.584
to pull her up
and get shot down.

00:39.584 --> 00:42.584
Don't do this!

00:42.584 --> 00:45.417
Winkie to winkie?

00:45.417 --> 00:47.959
Ah!

00:47.959 --> 00:49.626
How do you guys feel?

00:49.626 --> 00:51.667
Do you remember
making out with Fraser?

00:51.667 --> 00:53.000
-Did I?
-Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.250
Mother----er.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.209
I love the pictures
we got last night.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.250
What?

00:57.250 --> 01:24.584
-Did you not know that?
-No!

01:24.584 --> 01:27.334
[grunts]

01:27.334 --> 01:29.083
What, so I made out with Fraser?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.250
A lot of times,
all night, all night.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.000
Okay, I thought you guys
were gonna [bleep].

01:33.000 --> 01:35.501
[laughing]

01:35.501 --> 01:38.375
-No!
-Like, multiple times.

01:38.375 --> 01:42.542
No!

01:42.542 --> 01:43.667
I made out with Jake.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.667
Yes, you did.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.167
So embarrassing.

01:46.167 --> 01:48.000
I can't believe
that that happened

01:48.000 --> 01:52.501
and I had no recollection.

01:52.501 --> 01:54.125
I'm worried that it's
gonna affect the friendship,

01:54.125 --> 01:59.709
because things get weird
when people hook up.

01:59.709 --> 02:00.918
It was, like, really hot.

02:00.918 --> 02:02.375
It was all...

02:02.375 --> 02:04.334
Oh, my God, the tongue
was right in here, hey?

02:04.334 --> 02:05.375
Everything.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.083
Ah!

02:07.083 --> 02:11.417
I had a good night,
and that's all that matters.

02:11.417 --> 02:16.125
So, yeah, I feel awkward.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.083
-Achoo!
-Bless you!

02:18.083 --> 02:19.083
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.167
-You sure?
-Yeah.

02:20.167 --> 02:21.959
It's nothing to be upset about.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.250
No, no, it's embarrassing
that I got ----ing wasted

02:23.250 --> 02:24.459
and don't remember anything.

02:24.459 --> 02:26.667
-You were very cute.
-Thank you.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.250
[fly buzzes]

02:28.250 --> 02:29.584
I really would like
the flies to go away,

02:29.584 --> 02:34.167
but apparently that's
not an option.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.334
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:35.334 --> 02:37.959
Good, strong rinse.

02:37.959 --> 02:40.042
Plug it in, plug it in,
plug it in.

02:40.042 --> 02:41.334
So many euphemism.

02:41.334 --> 02:42.667
Oh, my God, last night.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.459
Sexy man!

02:44.459 --> 02:45.459
Woohoo!

02:45.459 --> 02:47.125
Fraser, I love you, babe!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.584
Sorry about last night, mate.

02:48.584 --> 02:50.375
I had the best ----ing time.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.626
All I know is that me and
you were making out a lot.

02:52.626 --> 02:55.209
Well, I'm really
sorry about that.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.125
No, it's cool.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.167
I'm very proud of myself
that I'm so free, sexually.

02:59.167 --> 03:00.292
You should be!

03:00.292 --> 03:01.959
You're a decent chap.

03:01.959 --> 03:05.083
I'm straight,
but I've kissed many guys.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.417
I don't give a [bleep]
what people think.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.209
As long as you're having fun,

03:08.209 --> 03:11.709
because that's what
life's about, isn't it?

03:11.709 --> 03:13.375
Anyway, I'll speak to you
later, mate.

03:13.375 --> 03:15.542
All right, peace out, bro.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.083
Sh-- happens,
we had a good night.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.417
Life is okay.

03:19.417 --> 03:21.417
[fly buzzes]

03:21.417 --> 03:27.250
Scared him.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.375
I bet I got him.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.459
Ah!

03:31.459 --> 03:32.459
Show me what's been going on.

03:32.459 --> 03:33.959
So, these both need to be done.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.584
-I've just fit...
-Both of them?

03:35.584 --> 03:37.042
I thought each room had one
bed that wasn't slept in?

03:37.042 --> 03:38.375
Jess took the sheets off.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.709
Hm, that's awesome.

03:40.709 --> 03:41.959
It's fine.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.334
For the charter going forward,

03:43.334 --> 03:44.542
I'm gonna put a
little pressure on Jess.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.375
Okay.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.042
And I'd love to put her on
service and you on laundry.

03:48.042 --> 03:49.250
Okay.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.501
Wanna see if a
little excitement

03:50.501 --> 03:52.125
might bring her out of
her shell a bit.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.959
Yeah, that's not
a bad shot, actually.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.459
I feel like that's the last
kind of play I have in my book.

03:55.459 --> 03:58.667
Team morale is the backbone
of a successful crew,

03:58.667 --> 04:02.709
and usually I can pull
someone out of a funk.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.042
I've never had to
fire a stew before.

04:05.042 --> 04:06.042
So, I'm gonna put
you on earlies.

04:06.042 --> 04:07.709
Yeah, okay, great.

04:07.709 --> 04:10.083
I'm hoping that switching
the roles will be a new light

04:10.083 --> 04:11.417
at the end of
the tunnel for Jess,

04:11.417 --> 04:13.501
because it's time
to kick some ass.

04:13.501 --> 04:17.250
Good luck, you're gonna need it.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.709
Oh, the stainless,
what have you done so far?

04:18.709 --> 04:19.709
Oh, all of this.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.083
There we go.

04:21.083 --> 04:28.083
♪ Makin' this laundry my bitch

04:28.083 --> 04:31.083
Eddie, Rachel, Heather, I need
you guys in the crew mess.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.250
Copy that.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.375
Copy that, Captain.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.626
-I can scoot down more.
-Sure.

04:34.626 --> 04:36.250
-Howdy-hey-ho.
-Howdy, howdy.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.125
-Howdy, howdy, Cap.
-How we doing?

04:38.125 --> 04:40.083
Charter number quattro.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.334
Primary charter guest
is Michael Cadez.

04:42.334 --> 04:45.334
Michael's a Colorado-based
distributor for Anheuser-Busch.

04:45.334 --> 04:47.334
Michael fought a battle
with cancer

04:47.334 --> 04:49.459
and received a clean bill
of health one year ago,

04:49.459 --> 04:51.209
and has planned
this charter to celebrate

04:51.209 --> 04:52.751
with friends and family.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.751
Way to go, Michael.

04:54.751 --> 04:56.501
On night one,
they've invited me to dinner.

04:56.501 --> 04:58.959
They're gonna
have a booby party.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.125
The primary recovered
from breast cancer.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.459
Right.

05:01.459 --> 05:02.501
So, I guess
we're celebrating boobs.

05:02.501 --> 05:04.125
Cancer's a son of a bitch.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.125
Three years ago, my mom
was diagnosed with cancer.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.751
We're really close,
it was really rough.

05:07.751 --> 05:09.459
There was a realization
that I could lose her.

05:09.459 --> 05:11.125
You know, that...
that was scary.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.626
But she's got
a clean bill of health now,

05:12.626 --> 05:14.167
and she's a tough bitch.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.959
I love her.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.542
A pain in my ass too, though.
She's my mom, you know.

05:17.542 --> 05:21.417
And night two, they want a Greek
dinner served family-style.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.709
Group looks forward
to celebrating with drinks

05:23.709 --> 05:27.167
always in hand and water
toys available at all times.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.250
We're talking a
meat-and-potatoes family here.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.250
-Yeah.
-I could see a barbeque.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.417
Any questions?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.209
What time
do we pick up tomorrow?

05:33.209 --> 05:36.584
It's a 12:00 pickup,
but I think we're gonna do

05:36.584 --> 05:40.083
something a little different.

05:40.083 --> 05:44.000
I think we'll leave the dock
about 10:00 in the morning,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.959
put the jet-skis in the water.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.292
Okay.

05:47.292 --> 05:49.167
And we will have everything
all set up,

05:49.167 --> 05:51.167
so the first time
they see the boat

05:51.167 --> 05:53.167
they'll see the water slide,
they'll see all the toys out.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.542
I think it'll be good.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.501
-Whatever you want, Cap.
-Yeah.

05:56.501 --> 05:58.459
I don't know why it
wasn't thought of sooner.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.125
We are wasting the first three
hours of their charter

06:02.125 --> 06:05.125
getting to our location,
setting up the water toys.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.709
Their holiday should start,

06:06.709 --> 06:08.751
bang, right when
they get on board.

06:08.751 --> 06:10.167
That's it, let's get to work,
finish up for the day.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.501
Ciao.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.584
He is so hating me right now.
[chuckles]

06:14.584 --> 06:17.167
I'm not a fan of this
10:00 leaving the dock.

06:17.167 --> 06:18.459
That's ----ing insane.

06:18.459 --> 06:28.375
Yeah, that's ----ing insane.

06:28.375 --> 06:36.292
Did I ever ask you how
you got into yachting?

06:36.292 --> 06:37.584
It's weird, I don't see
a lot of Black folks

06:37.584 --> 06:45.959
in the yachting world.

06:45.959 --> 06:50.250
I haven't gotten any
blatant racists.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.584
You're from the islands,
so it's a little different.

06:51.584 --> 06:54.959
But it is a whole nother
ballgame in the States.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.501
Like, it's insanity.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.459
I grew up with racist friends,
and I just ignored it.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.125
But I went to high school
in the States.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.626
You did go... you did go
to high school in the States.

07:01.626 --> 07:04.375
Yeah, and I would be in
St. Thomas for half the year.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.626
Is it...
like, how is it in the islands?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.292
Eight-five percent Black.

07:07.292 --> 07:08.542
Like, I don't feel weird.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.125
I don't have that
sinking feeling,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.083
and this is why I love
the Caribbean so much.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.667
I wish everybody could feel
that for a brief moment.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.334
All I know is being
Black in America is not easy.

07:17.334 --> 07:20.167
I've gotten beaten up by cops,
I've gotten maced by cops.

07:20.167 --> 07:23.042
One time, me and my homegirl,
we were out;

07:23.042 --> 07:25.125
next thing I know we
getting beat the [bleep] up

07:25.125 --> 07:28.000
in the elevator by, like,
three white guys, literally.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.334
They were calling us
monkeys and ----ing sh--.

07:30.334 --> 07:32.083
Where was this?

07:32.083 --> 07:44.083
In Minneapolis, where the
George Floyd thing happened.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.417
It was just the most
scariest thing

07:45.417 --> 07:46.584
I've ever went through
in my life.

07:46.584 --> 07:57.542
What the [bleep]
is wrong with people?

07:57.542 --> 07:59.501
I'm very traumatized
by a lot of things

07:59.501 --> 08:02.167
that have happened
to me, you know?

08:02.167 --> 08:06.250
I've had racism, even though
my father's white, so I get it,

08:06.250 --> 08:08.709
and I can definitely empathize
with what Rayna's saying.

08:08.709 --> 08:11.417
But I have not
had multiple dudes

08:11.417 --> 08:14.292
spewing slurs and beat me up.

08:14.292 --> 08:17.209
I have not had that much hurt

08:17.209 --> 08:19.083
and I don't know
what that's like.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.626
But we live to see
another day, baby, right?

08:22.626 --> 08:24.125
-Let's go to bed.
-Let's go.

08:24.125 --> 08:24.125
Ah.

08:24.125 --> 08:35.584
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

08:35.584 --> 08:41.083
Oh [bleep] my life.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.083
-How are you?
-I'm all right, how y'all doing?

08:42.083 --> 08:43.667
Good.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.667
Interior, can you meet me
up in the sky lounge?

08:44.667 --> 08:46.209
Copy that.

08:46.209 --> 08:48.125
Game plan is blow up
the two NautiBuoys.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.042
As soon as we get
the provisions on,

08:50.042 --> 08:51.501
drop lines and get
the [bleep] outta here.

08:51.501 --> 08:52.667
-Yeah.
-And then we can get toys out.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.209
But we're actually...

08:54.209 --> 08:55.375
we're leaving the dock
at 10:00 a.m.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.167
It was Captain Lee's idea.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.167
Ah, I'm tired.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.667
It's gonna be one of those
balls-to-the-wall days, baby.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.626
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right?

09:01.626 --> 09:02.751
Let's do this.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.542
I don't know about you two,

09:04.542 --> 09:06.042
but I'm feeling very
excited about this charter.

09:06.042 --> 09:07.584
I would love to do
a little switch-up...

09:07.584 --> 09:09.083
-you on laundry...
-Cool.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.209
And have you on service.

09:11.209 --> 09:12.709
I think it'd just be a
great little change-up.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.542
I'm a little bit of a loner,

09:14.542 --> 09:18.209
so I'm not overly thrilled
about being guest-facing.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.125
The number one thing
I'm looking for in this charter,

09:20.125 --> 09:22.667
always making sure the guests
are checked on every 10 minutes.

09:22.667 --> 09:27.459
I don't know, that makes
me feel very awkward.

09:27.459 --> 09:28.959
I think it'll be
a nice little change.

09:28.959 --> 09:36.083
All right, let's pump these up.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.751
Are we still looking
at a 10:00 a.m. departure?

09:37.751 --> 09:40.626
Yeah, I'm gonna have you
drive the jet-skis over.

09:40.626 --> 09:43.584
We'll see how your deck crew
does getting off the dock.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.667
Mm-hmm.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.000
Thank you, Cap.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.167
What have we got?

09:47.167 --> 09:48.167
Those are all of
the clean napkins

09:48.167 --> 09:49.751
that have yet to be ironed.

09:49.751 --> 09:51.584
-We... I've just been...
-Do they need to be?

09:51.584 --> 09:53.584
Well, we've been kind of
putting that on the back burner

09:53.584 --> 09:57.125
because it's the last priority.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.751
What's happening, bros?

09:58.751 --> 10:00.334
How are we doing with toys,
what have we inflated?

10:00.334 --> 10:01.959
We've got the NautiBuoys
inflated...

10:01.959 --> 10:03.375
-Everything's inflated?
-On the table?

10:03.375 --> 10:04.626
What about this?

10:04.626 --> 10:06.250
I don't know whose room
that came from.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.626
Jake, you're taking
the boat off today.

10:07.626 --> 10:08.626
You're gonna
be calling the distances.

10:08.626 --> 10:09.626
Don't [bleep] it up.

10:09.626 --> 10:12.125
Oh!

10:12.125 --> 10:14.459
Okay, I'm gonna just get
to organizing it now.

10:14.459 --> 10:17.626
All crew, all crew,
provisions on the dock.

10:17.626 --> 10:19.000
These just are going
to the galley.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.042
It's just for interior.

10:20.042 --> 10:21.042
Where do you want the Evian?

10:21.042 --> 10:22.375
With the crew water.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.542
I gotta go pee-pee.

10:23.542 --> 10:24.626
Check this out, look at this.

10:24.626 --> 10:31.501
What is that?

10:31.501 --> 10:33.083
Yeah, I'd like this.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.417
-Is that it?
-Yeah, that's it for right now.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.417
These shawls and socks,
this can go in the...

10:36.417 --> 10:38.250
What is that...
this has a really bad smell.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.709
Throw that away.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.375
What is it?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.584
Oh, my God, that stinks so bad.

10:43.584 --> 10:46.083
That is so bad.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.542
Where were they?

10:47.542 --> 10:51.125
Up here, and the smell...
is absolutely revolting.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.584
I don't know.

10:52.584 --> 10:54.375
It not as if someone's been
working in here

10:54.375 --> 10:57.083
for the past few charters
and not noticed.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.167
It smells like rotten vagina.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.417
It does, not that
I would know, but...

11:00.417 --> 11:01.542
But see, this is why you're gay.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.209
This is why I'm gay,

11:03.209 --> 11:05.042
because I don't wanna
smell sh-- like that.

11:05.042 --> 11:08.459
Oh, good call.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.000
Jake, Jake, we are going
to get outta here.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.501
Copy, dropping lines.

11:12.501 --> 11:14.167
All right, Rayna.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.584
Copy that, let me know
when all lines are clear.

11:15.584 --> 11:16.626
Rayna, go grab this next one.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.083
Perfect.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.167
All lines are clear.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.626
Coming off.

11:21.626 --> 11:23.250
Five foot off the dock.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.501
I've never had to
call distances before,

11:27.501 --> 11:32.167
Stern, 10 foot off the dock.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.250
----ing hell.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.250
Holding at 25 feet off the dock.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.959
Stern, clear off the dock.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.209
Roger that, we're outta here.

11:40.209 --> 11:41.584
Well done.

11:41.584 --> 11:43.042
Are you excited to be
on service?

11:43.042 --> 11:44.584
I just do what
they tell me to do.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.083
I can tell you don't wanna be
in the laundry room.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.375
It might be good to change
things up.

11:48.375 --> 11:54.542
You can get
the laundry room in order.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.542
-You guys all right?
-Yeah.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.083
Good?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.209
So, let's go ahead
and prep the anchor.

11:58.209 --> 11:59.667
Copy that.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.417
Their lunch will be
grilled burgers, hot dogs,

12:02.417 --> 12:03.751
-they like that, so...
-Ooh!

12:03.751 --> 12:04.751
Yeah.

12:04.751 --> 12:06.292
Anchor's prepped.

12:06.292 --> 12:10.250
On my mark, two and a half...
and drop.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.667
Eddie, prepare
to come alongside.

12:11.667 --> 12:12.667
Copy.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.125
That's two and a half.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.709
Hold that and let's see
what happens.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.250
Long stay, 11:00,
it's just holding at the moment.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.626
Lock it in.

12:19.626 --> 12:21.250
[bleep] yeah, smashed it.

12:21.250 --> 12:30.542
That was...
that was good.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.167
All right, we can get this out.

12:32.167 --> 12:36.250
We've got under an hour.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.542
Um, see... really?
Really?

12:39.542 --> 12:41.709
Ten limes, five lemons,
eight grapefruit.

12:41.709 --> 12:43.209
-Is this ready to go out?
-Yeah.

12:43.209 --> 12:44.375
The slide's the priority.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.459
We're hitting that right now.

12:47.459 --> 12:50.167
This place is gross.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.000
Bada-boom, bada-bing.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.501
Do you know what I can find
more of these empty jars,

12:53.501 --> 12:58.167
because there's not
any left down there.

12:58.167 --> 12:59.959
I would just open everything up.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.542
-Oh.
-Always just open everything up.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.626
Be like, it'll be
a little crazy at first,

13:05.626 --> 13:07.584
but it's all about
the ride, right?

13:07.584 --> 13:12.125
Yep.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.250
-Did you drop it?
- Yeah.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.417
Okay.

13:16.417 --> 13:17.542
There you go, nice job,
good job.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.959
Ugh.

13:20.959 --> 13:27.125
Whoa.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.292
It's gotta go all the way out.

13:28.292 --> 13:31.417
All the way out, yeah.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.000
I'm getting somewhere.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Holy mother of ----ing Jesus
Christ and God...

13:34.000 --> 13:35.334
We're getting somewhere.

13:35.334 --> 13:36.334
...and Jesus, Mary,
Mary, and Joseph.

13:36.334 --> 13:37.459
Smile.

13:37.459 --> 13:38.709
Look what you've accomplished.

13:38.709 --> 13:39.959
-Eddie, we got an issue.
-What's that?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.459
Look at the bottom of the slide.

13:41.459 --> 13:43.459
-Oh, no.
-Who's ready to go swimming?

13:43.459 --> 13:50.209
I am!

13:50.209 --> 13:53.375
I'm gonna go down.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.334
Yeah. Fifteen minutes
to guest arrival.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.375
[bleep] we are running
outta time.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.542
This is my nightmare.

13:58.542 --> 14:01.083
Watch your step, ladies.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.042
All right, you wanna
get changed?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.292
You've got 15 minutes.

14:03.292 --> 14:04.292
Thank you.

14:04.292 --> 14:05.542
Let the slack off.

14:05.542 --> 14:06.542
-There you are.
-All right, that's good.

14:06.542 --> 14:09.501
Start inflating, up top.

14:09.501 --> 14:11.542
Say again?

14:11.542 --> 14:14.167
What's the hold-up with that
inflation on top, let's go.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.334
Copy.

14:15.334 --> 14:19.751
Wes, like, come on.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.125
That's good.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.417
Make sure the guys
are changed up.

14:23.417 --> 14:24.626
-I need a beer.
-I thought there'd be

14:24.626 --> 14:26.209
-a crate of beer.
-What a view.

14:26.209 --> 14:30.709
Bitch, eat me.

14:30.709 --> 14:36.292
Lookin' nice,
lookin' very nice.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.250
I think we probably need
to pick up the pace a bit,

14:38.250 --> 14:40.584
we're running out of time.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.125
Attention all crew,
attention all crew,

14:42.125 --> 14:43.125
we've got guests in sight.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.167
In sight, [bleep].

14:45.167 --> 14:48.209
Let's make sure everybody is
ready to go on that aft deck.

14:48.209 --> 14:49.667
Wes, you hear that?

14:49.667 --> 14:51.042
-Wes!
-Yeah.

14:51.042 --> 14:53.292
Fraser, welcome
towels on standby.

14:53.292 --> 14:58.250
Where are they?

14:58.250 --> 15:04.292
Eddie, you take the stern.

15:04.292 --> 15:05.292
Jesus Christ.

15:05.292 --> 15:06.626
Where are we lining up?

15:06.626 --> 15:08.584
Bridge deck is uncovered
and pillows are good.

15:08.584 --> 15:09.626
Okay, everything is on deck.

15:09.626 --> 15:11.125
By the skin of our teeth.

15:11.125 --> 15:12.459
I always trust Captain Lee.

15:12.459 --> 15:14.125
He's got a method
to his madness.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.250
However, we're cutting things
a little close.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.501
It's just chaos.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.167
Who's doing the lines?

15:19.167 --> 15:20.334
Goddamn it.

15:20.334 --> 15:22.083
I need you guys up here.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.167
The only people I need on
the swim platform are Eddie.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.417
What the [bleep]?

15:25.417 --> 15:32.167
You're making
my life harder, Cap.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.501
We're here, we're here,
we're here.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.626
Gimme that, thank you.

15:36.626 --> 15:38.626
Goddamn it.

15:38.626 --> 15:41.375
The only person I need on
the swim platform is Eddie.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.626
Yes.

15:42.626 --> 15:44.334
Well, tits.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.459
I swore he said platform.

15:45.459 --> 15:46.792
-Well, hello, hello!
-Hello!

15:46.792 --> 15:49.125
-Welcome aboard My Seanna.
-Thank you.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.584
Hello!

15:50.584 --> 15:52.334
-Michael.
-Michael, my pleasure.

15:52.334 --> 15:53.709
-Michael, welcome on board.
-Hey.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.083
A glass of champagne for you.
There you are.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.751
-Hi, thanks.
-Nice to meet you.

15:56.751 --> 15:59.250
I'm loving your 'stache, man.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.751
You're cute.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.334
Welcome aboard, we're gonna
get your luggage.

16:02.334 --> 16:03.667
Heather is gonna take you
on a tour of the yacht,

16:03.667 --> 16:05.250
and then we'll get
the party started.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.375
Appreciate it!

16:06.375 --> 16:07.542
Well, come on up these stairs.

16:07.542 --> 16:08.542
-Can I grab luggage?
-Yeah.

16:08.542 --> 16:10.125
Ladies first, this way.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.459
Ditching the towel.

16:11.459 --> 16:14.209
So, this is what we call
the bridge deck aft.

16:14.209 --> 16:15.626
Oh, nice.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.042
Ample tanning area.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.792
Holy sh--.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.667
I'll warn you in the Caribbean
we have some pretty crazy wind.

16:20.667 --> 16:24.292
Well, hell, we're used to
blowing snow, so this is good.

16:24.292 --> 16:25.751
You got cold beer
in there, I hope.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.334
-I sure do.
-Hell, yeah.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.792
The sun deck.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.667
This is your entrance to
the infamous slide, as well.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.334
Yay!

16:32.334 --> 16:33.709
We're like, ready to rock
and roll on that thing.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.209
Yes, we are.

16:35.209 --> 16:36.751
Ooh, that looks
pretty and heavy.

16:36.751 --> 16:38.417
Shall we continue with the tour?

16:38.417 --> 16:40.167
Yeah, sorry,
we can do the tour.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.584
Get your butt going.

16:43.584 --> 16:45.417
-That's it.
-Quickly get changed.

16:45.417 --> 16:48.000
You've gotta hold on tight when
you get drunk there, Justin.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.125
-I just want more beer.
-The master suite.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.209
-Damn!
-Wow!

16:53.209 --> 16:54.209
I definitely wanna
get in the water.

16:54.209 --> 16:55.209
I wanna get in the water.

16:55.209 --> 16:56.542
Tonight, we've got a booby cake.

16:56.542 --> 16:57.834
I was gonna do, like,
a vanilla cake

16:57.834 --> 17:01.542
with coconut with,
like, cherry nipples.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.209
We're not gonna talk
about, like,

17:03.209 --> 17:04.834
my nipples sprouting, all right?

17:04.834 --> 17:06.792
These conversations go south
so ----ing quick.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.042
-Thank you.
-[wolf whistle]

17:09.042 --> 17:10.250
Mike, you wanna bunk
with me tonight?

17:10.250 --> 17:16.417
No!

17:16.417 --> 17:21.751
Where's Wes?

17:21.751 --> 17:24.792
I've never seen such a
cute little moustache.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.542
Oh, thank you very much.

17:27.542 --> 17:28.792
-Hold my beer.
-Yes, sir.

17:28.792 --> 17:32.209
Ah!

17:32.209 --> 17:35.542
[screams]

17:35.542 --> 17:37.042
Oh, God, look at that.

17:37.042 --> 17:41.709
We've gotta get it over
my big titties.

17:41.709 --> 17:46.083
Ah!

17:46.083 --> 17:49.083
The wine fridge.
There's, like, 12 bottles.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.083
Every time you say
the bridge pantry,

17:50.083 --> 17:51.751
I think they went outside.

17:51.751 --> 17:54.542
Why don't you get changed after
that and then set the table.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.167
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:57.167 --> 18:01.292
So, these, I can fold.

18:01.292 --> 18:03.209
I might as well dry them.

18:03.209 --> 18:07.250
I stripped that laundry room
from all of its sins.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.584
This is Captain Lee's.

18:08.584 --> 18:09.751
There's a tiny part of me
that wants Jess

18:09.751 --> 18:11.292
to fail in this one...

18:11.292 --> 18:14.083
-[hiccups]
-so I can go back to service.

18:14.083 --> 18:22.334
But I just need to smile
and wave and stay out of it.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.584
I'll get it for you.

18:23.584 --> 18:24.667
Maybe you wanna
sit for lunch in 15?

18:24.667 --> 18:25.667
Sure.

18:25.667 --> 18:29.709
Smoke is coming in hot.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.167
-Who wants a glass?
-Oh, I'll do a can.

18:32.167 --> 18:33.167
Thank you.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.626
Ah!

18:34.626 --> 18:36.167
Oh, flopped!

18:36.167 --> 18:38.334
It's nice hearing
guests having fun.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.459
Whew!

18:39.459 --> 18:40.459
All right, they're gonna sit.

18:40.459 --> 18:41.459
Okay, cool, sweet.

18:41.459 --> 18:43.000
Put the babies in the buns.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.334
So, I guess I'm the head
of the table, Dad?

18:44.334 --> 18:45.709
Of course you are.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.083
-Let's take a little break.
-Good.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.417
Go sit down in the crew,
cool off, relax.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.083
Okay.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.542
Look at that beer, though.
Look how cold that is.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.167
Do they drink a lot of
that out in Colorado?

18:53.167 --> 18:54.167
-Yes. Yes, they do.
-Oh, my gosh.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.167
Big time.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.209
Are these burgers good to go up?

18:56.209 --> 18:57.626
Yeah, they're ready to roll.

18:57.626 --> 19:00.209
Oh, mate, this laundry room
looks amazing.

19:00.209 --> 19:02.542
They look awesome.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.667
I hate that ----ing door.

19:05.667 --> 19:08.083
-Ooh!
-Oh, look at that sh--!

19:08.083 --> 19:09.542
That's all you get.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.209
Are you sh--ting me right now?

19:11.209 --> 19:13.167
This'll be the only salad
I eat this month.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.459
These are the best
sliders I've ever had.

19:14.459 --> 19:15.751
They're nice and
hot and warm, too.

19:15.751 --> 19:16.834
How you guys feeling?

19:16.834 --> 19:18.375
Just peachy.

19:18.375 --> 19:22.250
What a ----ing
full-on morning, hey?

19:22.250 --> 19:23.751
Yeah, well, we just gotta
work faster,

19:23.751 --> 19:27.209
-and then--
-Sick!

19:27.209 --> 19:28.417
I'm gonna go get dressed,
I'll be back.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.626
Have you got a problem?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.209
We were busting ass.

19:31.209 --> 19:32.209
Yeah, you think so?

19:32.209 --> 19:33.542
We... whoa.

19:33.542 --> 19:36.667
So, you could step it up
and get maximum effort.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.167
But we had our hands full
moving at warp speed.

19:39.167 --> 19:41.167
You need to move faster.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.626
You go too fast,
you're gonna get hurt.

19:42.626 --> 19:44.709
Yeah, but you can work
not like a ----ing slug.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.667
When it comes to me about moving
faster, I will address it.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.167
But when it's coming
from you, I'm good.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.042
You're the one responsible
for the time management

19:52.042 --> 19:53.709
so every little thing gets done.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.000
I shouldn't have to be there
to tell you every little thing,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.042
you know what I mean?

19:56.042 --> 19:57.417
I don't wanna be nagging.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.334
Speed up... got it.

19:59.334 --> 20:02.709
I hear those espresso
martinis coming.

20:02.709 --> 20:06.250
Hurricane Nicki has been
upgraded to category three.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.751
Why don't you sober up
with some Bud Lite?

20:07.751 --> 20:10.209
Yes, this is nice.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.375
Oh, my gosh,
what else are we gonna do?

20:12.375 --> 20:13.667
Do we go back out?

20:13.667 --> 20:15.167
I'm going on that trampoline.

20:15.167 --> 20:16.167
They're going up
and down the slide.

20:16.167 --> 20:17.292
I wasn't trying to be--

20:17.292 --> 20:18.667
You can do whatever you want.

20:18.667 --> 20:22.667
I'm gonna start
decorating these titties.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.167
I usually pinch nipples,
I don't really bite them.

20:25.167 --> 20:27.083
Oh, my God.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.250
You girls can't even stand, ha!

20:29.250 --> 20:31.334
Should I do your favorite
streamer job?

20:31.334 --> 20:33.375
You know how much I love it.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.125
Oh [bleep] me.

20:35.125 --> 20:41.626
Come down here,
everybody gets off.

20:41.626 --> 20:43.250
Booby party, here we come.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.959
All right, we'll get
all this sh-- away

20:44.959 --> 20:46.250
and then we'll
get into our blacks.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.250
These are quite good.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.709
----ing hell.

20:49.709 --> 20:54.083
Once you're done there,
you can go on a break.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.250
Welcome to my titty town.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.042
Lick my ----ing dick right now.

20:59.042 --> 21:00.542
This is for all you guys.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.083
Beautiful!

21:02.083 --> 21:03.083
Here for the boobs!

21:03.083 --> 21:04.417
I love this!

21:04.417 --> 21:06.542
I got really, really irritated,

21:06.542 --> 21:09.542
because Fraser was upset
that he got put on laundry.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.375
So, he threw a hissy
fit about

21:11.375 --> 21:12.751
the ----ing state
of the laundry room.

21:12.751 --> 21:14.459
I'm like, everybody's
been telling me

21:14.459 --> 21:16.125
-how great of a job I'm doing.
-Even Captain Lee.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.626
And then you wanna
----ing knock me down?

21:17.626 --> 21:19.334
I just don't have patience
for that sh--.

21:19.334 --> 21:21.125
You wanna act a certain way,
you can act a certain way

21:21.125 --> 21:23.125
and I'm just gonna ----ing
ignore you until you

21:23.125 --> 21:24.459
-act like a human being again.
-Yeah.

21:24.459 --> 21:26.042
I just don't like
it when other people

21:26.042 --> 21:27.584
start acting a certain way.

21:27.584 --> 21:27.584
I don't know that
I have much more to give.

21:27.584 --> 21:34.626
We're here, we're here,
we're here.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.751
We're going to
change into our blacks,

21:36.751 --> 21:38.083
then we'll come back out.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.375
Then we're gonna
move that slide.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.250
We're going down,
try to get ready.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.375
Service always gets hectic,
but it's just about, like,

21:42.375 --> 21:43.542
rolling with the punches.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.042
Yeah, okay.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.709
Gonna try and make
this look sexy somehow.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.751
Honey, take off
your gosh-darn...

21:49.751 --> 21:51.167
take it off, take it off.

21:51.167 --> 21:52.375
You're not wearing
that at dinner.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.542
Damn!

21:53.542 --> 21:54.834
I am not taking off
my Gilligan hat.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.292
-You're a nut.
-It's great!

21:56.292 --> 21:59.584
Go ahead and
start deflating that.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.542
That's what we're talking about.

22:01.542 --> 22:02.542
All right, you guys ready
to start hoisting?

22:02.542 --> 22:03.542
Yes, sir.

22:03.542 --> 22:04.542
Here we go.

22:04.542 --> 22:07.334
Oh, God. Jesus!

22:07.334 --> 22:08.334
This is gonna be fun.

22:08.334 --> 22:09.751
I want you to do my hair.

22:09.751 --> 22:11.375
I don't know how to do
your hair, honey.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.209
-Drink?
-You know it.

22:13.209 --> 22:16.667
Where's she at?

22:16.667 --> 22:20.250
Where'd she go?

22:20.250 --> 22:21.626
-Should I just make my own?
-Yeah.

22:21.626 --> 22:23.042
Cute.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.167
What kind of whiskey
they got here?

22:25.167 --> 22:26.709
What can I help you
with today, sir?

22:26.709 --> 22:28.042
There ya go!

22:28.042 --> 22:29.209
-Uh-oh!
-Am I allowed to do this?

22:29.209 --> 22:30.501
-It's your vacation.
-Yeah.

22:30.501 --> 22:32.125
What would you like to
mix it with?

22:32.125 --> 22:33.209
It's already laid out.

22:33.209 --> 22:34.834
-There you go.
-Jesus.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.167
-I'm sorry.
-No worries.

22:36.167 --> 22:37.834
Oh, my God, what the heck?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.292
What?

22:39.292 --> 22:40.292
Why are you making your drink?

22:40.292 --> 22:41.417
I'm bartender tonight.

22:41.417 --> 22:43.125
Can I make you some rum punch?

22:43.125 --> 22:45.250
This is embarrassing.

22:45.250 --> 22:48.709
I'm a very patient person, but
I'm at my wits' end, honestly.

22:48.709 --> 22:51.375
And I don't ever want a guest
making their own drink.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.667
I know, he...

22:52.667 --> 22:54.083
I would push him out,
just like I did.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.792
Okay.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.083
Make your territory known, or it
won't be your territory at all.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.709
You got it, babe.

22:59.709 --> 23:01.584
Heather is sucking
all of my energy

23:01.584 --> 23:02.834
right out the ----ing window.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.709
I would just go check,
like, rooms

23:04.709 --> 23:06.209
we could maybe get
into at the moment.

23:06.209 --> 23:07.709
Okay.

23:07.709 --> 23:10.375
I'm not the super stew
that she wants me to be.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.626
I'm definitely reaching
my breaking point, for sure.

23:12.626 --> 23:14.667
Ugh, kill me now.

23:14.667 --> 23:15.792
Fraser, Fraser, Heather.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.542
Go ahead, Heather.

23:17.542 --> 23:18.626
Can I get your help with
the table and such?

23:18.626 --> 23:21.292
Really? Hm-hm.

23:21.292 --> 23:22.792
-Okay.
-I'll do that right away.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.250
That would be amazing.

23:24.250 --> 23:27.292
You know what?
[bleep] this sh--.

23:27.292 --> 23:30.000
Guests were behind the
bar making their own drinks,

23:30.000 --> 23:31.584
and she was standing over there.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.083
I don't ever wanna ----ing
see someone behind here.

23:34.083 --> 23:36.501
I'm about to ----ing
rip sh-- open.

23:36.501 --> 23:37.709
Mental.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.209
Where's your pink shirt?

23:39.209 --> 23:43.292
Was that a real question?

23:43.292 --> 23:44.292
That looks really good.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.834
Random shoe.

23:46.834 --> 23:49.209
Ow, my bumhole.

23:49.209 --> 23:51.375
I love this shirt, yay!

23:51.375 --> 23:52.751
-Need some help in here?
-Yeah.

23:52.751 --> 23:53.751
All right, well,
I'll get somebody

23:53.751 --> 23:54.834
in here to help you out.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.250
Oh, my gosh, they're boobies!

23:57.250 --> 24:02.459
They could be pasties.

24:02.459 --> 24:03.709
What's happening, guys?

24:03.709 --> 24:05.501
Rachel needs help in the galley,

24:05.501 --> 24:09.709
and tomorrow, things have
to go ----ing perfectly.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.542
I need people to bust their ass.

24:11.542 --> 24:15.626
Be quick, be smooth,
be efficient, and no mistakes.

24:15.626 --> 24:17.417
Hey, Captain, how are you today?

24:17.417 --> 24:19.250
Thank you for allowing me
to dine with you this evening.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.626
Thank you!

24:20.626 --> 24:22.751
We're kinda celebrating my dad.

24:22.751 --> 24:24.250
He's a breast cancer
survivor, right?

24:24.250 --> 24:26.250
-Breast cancer-free!
-Congratulations.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.709
Thank you!

24:27.709 --> 24:30.375
They did chemo, and you
didn't miss a day of work.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.792
Nope.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.584
And you didn't miss
a day of your life.

24:33.584 --> 24:35.292
Nope... well, yeah,
just gotta keep on.

24:35.292 --> 24:36.667
-You can't...
-You keep on.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.167
Can't stop doing what
you're doing

24:38.167 --> 24:39.626
just because you have
something going on.

24:39.626 --> 24:41.667
Okay, let's get on
a better subject now.

24:41.667 --> 24:44.626
All right, cheers to you,
the one-boob wonder.

24:44.626 --> 24:45.792
Yeah.

24:45.792 --> 24:50.334
All of them have
officially seated.

24:50.334 --> 24:51.626
Busy.

24:51.626 --> 24:56.542
Tonight's theme
is titties a la carte.

24:56.542 --> 24:59.250
Michael has really
simple preferences.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.501
So, the goal is to
take everything

25:01.501 --> 25:07.584
that Michael really loves,
but zhivaderm it up.

25:07.584 --> 25:10.834
And then top it off with
a motorboatin' titty cake.

25:10.834 --> 25:17.042
♪ Forty-year-old mammaries,
shifting to the sides ♪

25:17.042 --> 25:19.209
-Buongiorno.
-Buongiorno.

25:19.209 --> 25:21.167
Get outta town!

25:21.167 --> 25:22.834
Oh, thank you, there it is.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.542
You have a Caribbean
conch fritter.

25:25.542 --> 25:28.250
Then you have a traditional
chowder base as well.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.667
-Yay!
-Thank you!

25:29.667 --> 25:31.334
Look at these little
treasure chests.

25:31.334 --> 25:32.334
Yeah!

25:32.334 --> 25:36.209
It's just too cute.

25:36.209 --> 25:37.417
It was so beautiful.

25:37.417 --> 25:39.125
-Right?
-Oh, my God!

25:39.125 --> 25:40.584
[yawns]

25:40.584 --> 25:41.584
I'm just gonna check
the master real quick.

25:41.584 --> 25:42.834
What kind of time do I got?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.375
-About five minutes.
-Beautiful.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.709
Do you have any
grandbabies or...

25:45.709 --> 25:48.501
I do, I have seven.

25:48.501 --> 25:50.375
-Oh!
-Well, that's good.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.209
Oh, come on.

25:52.209 --> 25:56.584
Jess, Jess, Heather. You wanna
meet me in the master?

25:56.584 --> 25:58.209
Oh, my God.

25:58.209 --> 26:01.250
So, I'm the oldest
of my dad's three girls.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.584
We say four, because
he loves his dog more

26:03.584 --> 26:05.792
than I think he does
all of his girls.

26:05.792 --> 26:08.584
Because she don't talk back.

26:08.584 --> 26:09.584
Hello, love.

26:09.584 --> 26:11.292
Okay, couple things.

26:11.292 --> 26:14.250
I would wipe this out
with paper towel, water drops.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.209
Yes, ma'am.
Mm-hmm.

26:15.209 --> 26:16.667
Here in the sink...

26:16.667 --> 26:19.542
Good day, actually,
it was a very good day.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.417
So, with knowing that,
I haven't looked downstairs yet.

26:21.417 --> 26:24.751
Okay.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.417
I'm just gonna plate
the potatoes right now.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.584
I love the sauce
with the peppers.

26:29.584 --> 26:31.709
-Right?
-Oh, my God, that's amazing.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.125
Chef is rock star.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.709
I think she's kinda cute.

26:35.709 --> 26:37.459
My wife has
yet another girl crush.

26:37.459 --> 26:41.834
I do!

26:41.834 --> 26:44.542
-Can I go with this?
-Yes, ready to roll.

26:44.542 --> 26:45.834
Thank you.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.667
For your final course,
a petit filet

26:47.667 --> 26:51.292
with a Hasselback
red potato and truffle.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.501
Looks awesome to me.

26:52.501 --> 26:54.709
Any A1 or Heinz 57?

26:54.709 --> 26:56.209
-Oh.
-Okay, I'll bring that to you.

26:56.209 --> 26:57.751
Yeah, good.

26:57.751 --> 26:59.375
Fraser, can you go down
in 10 minutes?

26:59.375 --> 27:09.792
Yeah.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.876
-Yeah.
-I don't fit in.

27:12.876 --> 27:14.501
I think you reach a certain age

27:14.501 --> 27:15.792
and you just don't
----ing care anymore.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.417
I don't need to fit in
everywhere I go.

27:17.417 --> 27:19.167
I'm a good party of one.

27:19.167 --> 27:20.709
All right, I have to clean
this bidet over here.

27:20.709 --> 27:21.834
I'll talk to you in a bit, okay?

27:21.834 --> 27:26.709
Yep.

27:26.709 --> 27:28.834
♪ Titties

27:28.834 --> 27:31.834

27:39.667 --> 27:41.417
-No.
-That was a big fish.

27:41.417 --> 27:46.375
That's inside-out; I don't care.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.751
How you feeling, man?

27:47.751 --> 27:49.417
-I'm tired.
-Yeah, you look tired.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.626

that is so discomboobulated.

28:10.209 --> 28:11.792
You know, it's usually
her blowing it, not me.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.459

-Hey!

28:13.459 --> 28:15.250
Thank you so much.

28:15.250 --> 28:16.792
You are so welcome.

28:16.792 --> 28:18.292

28:30.250 --> 28:32.751
Holy sh-- it's cold

-This is an early night.
-Thank God.

28:34.459 --> 28:35.626
We closing?

28:35.626 --> 28:37.250
Jennifer's closing.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.250
Is she pulling the plates
for tomorrow morning?

28:38.250 --> 28:39.250
Yeah, I wrote that on her list.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.083
Awesome.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.209
I'm gonna lose my sh--
tomorrow if nothing changes.

28:42.209 --> 28:49.250
Oh, I know.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.250
There's no way I'm gonna make
it through the rest

28:51.250 --> 28:54.209
of the season with Fraser
in a happy place

28:54.209 --> 28:56.459
if we're constantly
picking up after Jess.

28:56.459 --> 28:58.667
-All right, I'm gonna go down.
-All right, good night.

28:58.667 --> 29:01.292
-There's the list.
-Mm-hmm.

29:01.292 --> 29:04.209
And let me talk to you
for two seconds.

29:04.209 --> 29:05.626
Sure.

29:05.626 --> 29:07.501
I've just been trying to
have this conversation,

29:07.501 --> 29:09.459
because at the end of the day
I just have to say

29:09.459 --> 29:11.417
that there is, like,
all eyes on you right now.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.626
And training day is,
like, over with.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.751
Not having enough time
is not an excuse anymore.

29:15.751 --> 29:17.751
The load is just
too much on all ends.

29:17.751 --> 29:17.751
It's coming to the point
of, like, a last straw.

29:17.751 --> 29:25.876
We're going to
change into our blacks,

29:25.876 --> 29:28.292
I just have to say that
there is, like,

29:28.292 --> 29:30.125
all eyes on you right now,
and training day

29:30.125 --> 29:31.584
is, like, over with.

29:31.584 --> 29:34.292
It's coming to the point
of, like, a last straw.

29:34.292 --> 29:35.626
Everybody's coming to
me and being, like,

29:35.626 --> 29:37.167
oh, you're doing such
a great job,

29:37.167 --> 29:38.501
and then all of a
sudden it's like, no?

29:38.501 --> 29:39.792
It's positive reinforcement...

29:39.792 --> 29:41.125
Sure.

29:41.125 --> 29:42.125
Because it felt for
a while, like...

29:42.125 --> 29:43.417
Okay.

29:43.417 --> 29:44.834
You were just bummed
with everything.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.626
It's probably just,
like, resting face.

29:46.626 --> 29:47.626
-It's not...
-Yeah.

29:47.626 --> 29:49.584
I'm bummed at all.

29:49.584 --> 29:51.501
Now I kinda am, but I'll just
sleep it off and get over it.

29:51.501 --> 29:54.417
But I'm just saying, like,
the laundry room today,

29:54.417 --> 29:57.626
I think the fact that
Fraser made it look like that

29:57.626 --> 30:00.083
within two hours,
I just want you to know that,

30:00.083 --> 30:01.501
like, the pressure's there.

30:01.501 --> 30:04.375
We can't have hair
in the master sink.

30:04.375 --> 30:07.417
I just want the standard
to be risen a little more.

30:07.417 --> 30:09.167
Yes, ma'am, gotcha.

30:09.167 --> 30:10.834
I feel terrible,
but we're not here

30:10.834 --> 30:13.125
to coddle one another,
sing "Kumbaya."

30:13.125 --> 30:15.125
I just really need
Jess to understand

30:15.125 --> 30:17.125
that there's no room
for errors anymore.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.459
We need to show up or ship out.

30:19.459 --> 30:21.459
Well, we try again tomorrow
and we see where it takes us.

30:21.459 --> 30:23.042
-All right, go to bed.
-Cool.

30:23.042 --> 30:26.209
I'm gonna do the same.

30:26.209 --> 30:28.209
Good night, Jess.

30:28.209 --> 30:30.542
You okay?
Yeah.

30:30.542 --> 30:32.542
At this point,
I'm really questioning

30:32.542 --> 30:34.417
whether I should be here or not.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.792
I'm here for a reason,
and that's to make some money.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.417
I was never planning on
being your maid for life.

30:39.417 --> 30:41.584
So, is it worth it?

30:41.584 --> 30:50.167
Is it worth it?
I don't know.

30:50.167 --> 31:03.375
What?

31:03.375 --> 31:08.417
Oh, hell, no.

31:08.417 --> 31:21.626
She is a fake-ass bitch.

31:21.626 --> 31:23.876
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

31:23.876 --> 31:29.375
Oh [bleep].

31:29.375 --> 31:31.167
Ah, [bleep].

31:31.167 --> 31:32.167
-Can I get some orange juice?
-Of course you can, yeah.

31:32.167 --> 31:33.417
-And a water?
-Yes.

31:33.417 --> 31:35.083
-Can I do some coffee?
-Yeah, great.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.667
-Thank you.
-No worries.

31:37.667 --> 31:39.209
Yah!

31:39.209 --> 31:40.459
-Hey, good morning.
-You do main deck aft?

31:40.459 --> 31:41.709
Yeah, main deck's already done.

31:41.709 --> 31:44.584
Here we are.
Awesome.

31:44.584 --> 31:46.375
-Good morning.
-How you feeling?

31:46.375 --> 31:53.834
Awesome.

31:53.834 --> 31:55.584
How are you?

31:55.584 --> 31:57.918
I'm doing just wonderfully,
thank you for asking.

31:57.918 --> 31:59.501
Yeah? Come here.

31:59.501 --> 32:00.584
You all right?

32:00.584 --> 32:01.918
I had a night to sleep on it,

32:01.918 --> 32:03.751
and I just decided that,
you know,

32:03.751 --> 32:05.375
I don't like to be a quitter.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.459
So, Heather is
not pushing me out.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.876
I wanna finish this,
and I wanna finish it right.

32:09.876 --> 32:10.876
All right, see you in a bit.

32:10.876 --> 32:12.375
See you later.

32:12.375 --> 32:14.709
-Morning, morning.
-Morning, morning.

32:14.709 --> 32:15.751
I guess we're pulling
the hook in about an hour,

32:15.751 --> 32:17.125
and then we can get toys out,

32:17.125 --> 32:18.125
and then put
the slide up, so, nice.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.209
All right.

32:19.209 --> 32:21.250
I'm gonna do cake doughnuts now,

32:21.250 --> 32:22.584
and then I'm gonna do the eggs
benny, and I'm ready to roll.

32:22.584 --> 32:23.584
-Awesome.
-How are you doing, Michael?

32:23.584 --> 32:26.584
Good, thank you.

32:26.584 --> 32:28.501
Wow.

32:28.501 --> 32:31.209
I could send you down to cabins.

32:31.209 --> 32:32.834
What are you doing?

32:32.834 --> 32:34.125
I killed a bug.

32:34.125 --> 32:36.083
-Good morning.
-Woo!

32:36.083 --> 32:37.542
Good morning.

32:37.542 --> 32:39.584
So, this morning, Rachel
has maple-glazed cake doughnuts

32:39.584 --> 32:41.834
and a traditional eggs Benedict.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.417
-Eggs Benedict, please.
-Eggs Benedict.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.667
Yee-haw.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.167
I want a doughnut too,
I'm sorry.

32:46.167 --> 32:48.083
So, diabetes and
heart attack, right here.

32:48.083 --> 32:50.042
-Just, like, check their waters.
-Yeah.

32:50.042 --> 32:51.542
Ah, just the guy
I wanted to see.

32:51.542 --> 32:52.751
-Are you ready to go?
-Yeah.

32:52.751 --> 32:55.125
Deck team, deck team,

32:55.125 --> 32:56.626
we're gonna start pulling the
anchor in about five minutes.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.709
Yeah, copy.

32:57.709 --> 32:58.709
-Seven eggs Benedicts.
-Okay.

32:58.709 --> 32:59.834
That's ready to roll.

32:59.834 --> 33:01.125
How's everybody feeling today?

33:01.125 --> 33:02.167
Wonderful.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.209
I had the sh--s this morning.

33:04.209 --> 33:06.125
Listen to our breakfast talk.

33:06.125 --> 33:07.417
Amazing, amazing.

33:07.417 --> 33:08.584
All right.

33:08.584 --> 33:09.584
-Oh!
-Anchor's prepped.

33:09.584 --> 33:11.751
Okay.

33:11.751 --> 33:13.834
Oh, Jesus Christ, Eddie,

33:13.834 --> 33:15.250
you act like you're my age,
for [bleep]'s sake.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.751
I feel like
I'm your age sometimes.

33:16.751 --> 33:18.375
Except I still have my mind.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.751
Ooh!

33:19.751 --> 33:21.167
All right, let's start
pulling the anchor.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.792
Copy, bringing her home.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.501
Is it okay if I put it on your
plate for you two to share?

33:24.501 --> 33:25.501
Yeah, sure.

33:25.501 --> 33:27.459
Anchor at the waterline.

33:27.459 --> 33:29.250
Oh, my gosh, that's so good.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.292
Anchor home, anchor home.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.709
Copy that, lock her in.

33:32.709 --> 33:33.709
Good job on that.

33:33.709 --> 33:35.209
We're moving!

33:35.209 --> 33:37.667
Oh, it feels good,
that breeze feels good.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.375
Activate your stabilizers.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.667
Okay, now give it
five degrees to starboard.

33:42.667 --> 33:43.834
You can hit it with a little bit
of cracked black pepper,

33:43.834 --> 33:45.709
and they're ready to roll.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.459
We're just gonna have one
person on each deck for a bit,

33:47.459 --> 33:49.083
and we're just gonna
keep an eye on the slide.

33:49.083 --> 33:50.626
-Here we go.
-Oh, my.

33:50.626 --> 33:52.417
Oh, my gosh, that looks good.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.459
Extra sauce here for you.

33:54.459 --> 33:56.083
-This is so good.
-Mm!

33:56.083 --> 33:57.584
Oh, I love these eggs.

33:57.584 --> 33:59.417
-Deck team, how are we looking?
-Main deck is good.

33:59.417 --> 34:00.626
Bridge deck's looking good.

34:00.626 --> 34:02.292
How was it, waking up early?

34:02.292 --> 34:04.334
It's really nice for
something different.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.209
Deck team, deck team,
prepare for anchor drop.

34:06.209 --> 34:07.501
-Copy.
-All guests are happy.

34:07.501 --> 34:08.876
That concludes
breakfast service.

34:08.876 --> 34:12.250
Okay, Goddamn it.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.667
Clear this out of your way, sir.

34:13.667 --> 34:14.709
Oh, that was so good, thank you.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.083
All right, get ready, guys.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.542
Copy, Wes is dropping.

34:17.542 --> 34:21.083
Go ahead and drop,
two shots, two shots.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.584
They're dropping anchor.

34:23.584 --> 34:24.834
Now let him know it's two shots.

34:24.834 --> 34:26.375
-Two shots.
-Two shots.

34:26.375 --> 34:27.751
Keep that brake in tight.

34:27.751 --> 34:29.792
Yeah, we have a nice,
long stay at 11:00.

34:29.792 --> 34:32.083
All right, go ahead
and lock her in.

34:32.083 --> 34:33.417
Good job.

34:33.417 --> 34:34.459
Look how pretty this
water is, you guys.

34:34.459 --> 34:37.083
I'm gonna go put my suit on.

34:37.083 --> 34:38.501
I love you.

34:38.501 --> 34:39.751
Eddie, Eddie, Lee.

34:39.751 --> 34:41.417
I was just thinking
I can go ahead

34:41.417 --> 34:43.250
and pop the skis over,
if you can spare somebody.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.334
Yeah, we could do that.

34:44.334 --> 34:45.626
I could send Jake up to you,

34:45.626 --> 34:47.417
and you two can put the
skis in the water.

34:47.417 --> 34:51.209
Copy that.

34:51.209 --> 34:52.626
You gotta rally.

34:52.626 --> 34:54.667
He's, like, passed
out on the lounger.

34:54.667 --> 34:57.167
I need a resurrection, ah.

34:57.167 --> 34:59.209
-NautiBuoys out?
-NautiBuoys are out.

34:59.209 --> 35:04.501
Go get wet, Jake.

35:04.501 --> 35:07.626
-Eddie, take a second.
-Eddie, stop going down.

35:07.626 --> 35:11.459
Eddie, don't go down
any more with the slide.

35:11.459 --> 35:13.834
This is twisted on the bottom.

35:13.834 --> 35:15.459
You see this right here?

35:15.459 --> 35:16.417
Do you think you can
inflate a little bit,

35:16.417 --> 35:17.584
because look down here.

35:17.584 --> 35:19.417
I don't know if it's twisted.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.584
I just wanna see what's going on
before it keeps coming down.

35:20.584 --> 35:21.626
They should have
pulled that slide

35:21.626 --> 35:23.209
and not let it down that far.

35:23.209 --> 35:25.167
If we got a free guy,
then I would say put

35:25.167 --> 35:27.209
somebody in a ski
to pull that foot out.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.417
Copy that, jumping in.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.751
I bet they hate blowing
that thing up.

35:29.751 --> 35:31.417
Oh, yeah, sure.

35:31.417 --> 35:32.542
It's taking a lot longer
than I thought.

35:32.542 --> 35:34.834
Go up towards the bow, Wes.

35:34.834 --> 35:37.626
Hey, Wes, you need
to attach it to your stern

35:37.626 --> 35:40.667
so you get more ----ing pull.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.167
He's not getting it.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.501
Goddamn it.

35:44.501 --> 35:46.417
-What are you doing, Wes?
-Wes!

35:46.417 --> 35:47.667
Clint, let's get on
those jet-skis

35:47.667 --> 35:48.667
and show these boys
how to do it.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.209
Why is he dragging it that way?

35:50.209 --> 35:51.375
I don't know, okay?

35:51.375 --> 35:53.459
Jesus Christ.
Stand down.

35:53.459 --> 35:55.751
Wes is not listening, five
people are talking at once,

35:55.751 --> 35:58.584
Captain Lee trying to help, but
too many chefs in the kitchen.

35:58.584 --> 36:00.417
This ain't ----ing
rocket science.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.250
And all of this is happening
right in front of the guests.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.792
It's embarrassing.

36:04.792 --> 36:09.292
-Let's take up on it.
-Copy, hoisting.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.626
[bleep] As long as it's gonna
take them to do this, we...

36:10.626 --> 36:12.125
day'll be over.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.459
-Okay, okay.
-All right, we got it, hold off.

36:13.459 --> 36:14.876
I need that red line.

36:14.876 --> 36:19.375
Son of a...
guess what you did, Wes?

36:19.375 --> 36:21.375
-He sucked it up.
-He did, in the jet-ski?

36:21.375 --> 36:23.167
-Yep.
-Sucked the rope in.

36:23.167 --> 36:24.876
Jesus Christ.

36:24.876 --> 36:27.334
This is the Moe, Larry,
and Curly show on steroids.

36:27.334 --> 36:28.667
Wes, Wes!

36:28.667 --> 36:29.667
Is the whole thing
in the water again?

36:29.667 --> 36:31.792
Shut up for a second.

36:31.792 --> 36:33.542
Wes, I need you in the water,
handing me that line again

36:33.542 --> 36:36.751
Eddie is about to explode
like Mt. Vesuvius.

36:36.751 --> 36:39.375
Unacceptable.
He's the first officer.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.125
Goddamn it, act like it.

36:41.125 --> 36:41.125
This is really
pissing me off now.

36:41.125 --> 36:47.834
I just have to say that
there is, like,

36:47.834 --> 36:50.375
-He sucked it up.
-In the jet-ski?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.834
We look like a bunch
of Goddamned idiots.

36:52.834 --> 36:54.334
Hey, Wes, Wes.

36:54.334 --> 36:55.584
Is the whole thing
in the water again?

36:55.584 --> 36:56.918
Shut up for a second.

36:56.918 --> 36:58.751
Oh sh--.

36:58.751 --> 37:00.375
Wes, I need you in the water,
handing me that line again.

37:00.375 --> 37:01.876
Let's try and keep our
voices down, people.

37:01.876 --> 37:03.626
-We got this.
-Got it.

37:03.626 --> 37:06.209
Let's start inflating
that foot as well.

37:06.209 --> 37:08.334
Eddie, go down and
help her with the foot.

37:08.334 --> 37:09.834
How you doing with
that Michelob Ultra, sir?

37:09.834 --> 37:10.834
I'll take a cold one, please.

37:10.834 --> 37:12.209
Absolutely.

37:12.209 --> 37:15.417
Jake, go ahead and
inflate up top.

37:15.417 --> 37:16.626
Do they almost have it?

37:16.626 --> 37:20.792
Are we inflating
that foot right now?

37:20.792 --> 37:21.876
Ooh...

37:21.876 --> 37:23.209
Eddie, ah!

37:23.209 --> 37:25.250
Take this line up top.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.709
Oh, my God.

37:26.709 --> 37:29.125
-It's not at a 45?
-No, it's at a 45.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.667
-That's all I needed to hear.
-It doesn't mean I like it.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.334
Let's get the water toys out.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.584
There's a cold one for you, sir.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.876
Oh, why, thank you so much.

37:34.876 --> 37:37.709
-Eddie, Eddie, to the bridge.
-Copy.

37:37.709 --> 37:40.584
It's all right.

37:40.584 --> 37:42.626
[bleep]. Um...

37:42.626 --> 37:43.792
[bleep]

37:43.792 --> 37:45.626
I ----ed up.

37:45.626 --> 37:48.125
Line got outta my hand, went in
the water, pfft, ran over it.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.375
He sucked it up.

37:49.375 --> 37:50.918
Jesus Christ.

37:50.918 --> 37:52.834
I got a lot more to learn
about the yachting world.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.626
I miss sailing.

37:54.626 --> 37:56.834
It's in my control,
I like the slow pace of things.

37:56.834 --> 37:58.667
That's my cup of tea.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.834
It's the most unorganized
thing I've ever witnessed.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.334
Just a little patience
would go so far.

38:03.334 --> 38:06.584
What's up?

38:06.584 --> 38:08.167
Take a deep breath for a second.

38:08.167 --> 38:09.375
-Okay.
-What happened, happened.

38:09.375 --> 38:10.584
Let it go.

38:10.584 --> 38:11.584
Everything has ----ing
gone wrong.

38:11.584 --> 38:12.918
-I know.
-Everything.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.501
But you've gotta rise
above that,

38:14.501 --> 38:16.751
so you need to calm down,
and then go about

38:16.751 --> 38:19.292
getting your job done
the best you can

38:19.292 --> 38:20.709
with what you have to work with.

38:20.709 --> 38:22.292
I'm gonna rip someone's
----ing head off.

38:22.292 --> 38:23.834
-That's my job.
-Okay.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.334
-All right?
-Yeah.

38:25.334 --> 38:27.417
Eddie losing his
sh-- is a mistake.

38:27.417 --> 38:29.542
When you start getting
into upper-level management,

38:29.542 --> 38:30.834
it's added pressure.

38:30.834 --> 38:33.334
I understand,
but you can't overreact,

38:33.334 --> 38:34.667
you have guests on board.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.709
He needs to get his
emotions under control.

38:36.709 --> 38:38.751
That's why you got
three stripes.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.834
It's time to bust
out the big-boy pants.

38:40.834 --> 38:41.918
-Put it behind you.
-Yeah.

38:41.918 --> 38:43.584
-We'll fix it.
-Okay.

38:43.584 --> 38:46.542
If you get back in the ring
the way you are now,

38:46.542 --> 38:48.250
it's gonna have
a disastrous ending.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.375
-Thanks, Captain.
-Yep.

38:50.375 --> 38:53.417
You were just out there telling
us how much we're ----ing up,

38:53.417 --> 38:54.959
and now you're telling me to
calm down?

38:54.959 --> 38:57.375
It's embarrassing and
infuriating all at once.

38:57.375 --> 39:02.334
I'm gonna take a quick minute.

39:02.334 --> 39:09.542
There we are.

39:09.542 --> 39:11.667
Whew... breathe.

39:11.667 --> 39:15.209
One, two, three.

39:15.209 --> 39:16.501
Phew.

39:16.501 --> 39:17.501
-They ready for us?
-Yeah.

39:17.501 --> 39:18.626
-Hi.
-Hi.

39:18.626 --> 39:19.626
-You guys ready?
-Yeah.

39:19.626 --> 39:20.626
Go where the wind takes us.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.626
Kayak time!

39:22.626 --> 39:24.792
Good luck.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.292
He's gonna end up
way over there.

39:26.292 --> 39:27.292
And we're gonna have
to go get him?

39:27.292 --> 39:28.501
Yeah, I guarantee it.

39:28.501 --> 39:29.501
Come on, we have to
do the slide,

39:29.501 --> 39:39.959
they went through all that.

39:39.959 --> 39:41.751
Look, see, he stopped.
I think he's all right.

39:41.751 --> 39:44.876
-Fraser.
-Hey.

39:44.876 --> 39:46.375
What do you mean?

39:46.375 --> 39:47.876
Jess came in the room
about to cry,

39:47.876 --> 39:49.167
and she's like,
"I just wanna go home."

39:49.167 --> 39:52.876
What?

39:52.876 --> 39:56.542
Well, has she been
pulling her weight, no.

39:56.542 --> 40:00.709
I can tell you that.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.292
I just wanted to let
you know, okay? See you later.

40:02.292 --> 40:04.876
-Thank you, babe.
-Love you.

40:04.876 --> 40:06.584
How are you doing?

40:06.584 --> 40:09.167
-I'm good right now.
-Beautiful.

40:09.167 --> 40:10.751
Who is that man
that's in my galley?

40:10.751 --> 40:12.125
Hey, how you doing, sweetie?

40:12.125 --> 40:13.501
-I can do that.
-I got it, I just got...

40:13.501 --> 40:15.292
-Thank you.
-Two more pans.

40:15.292 --> 40:16.375
I appreciate that,
I'll help you dry.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.918
I know you do.

40:17.918 --> 40:19.542
Captain Lee, can I grab
your laundry from somewhere?

40:19.542 --> 40:22.250
Yes, you can...

40:22.250 --> 40:26.250
Yeah.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.584
I'm glad you noticed,
thank you very much.

40:27.584 --> 40:29.209
That means a lot to me,
thank you, Captain.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.876
You're welcome, sir.

40:31.876 --> 40:34.167
You got the current
now coming, woo!

40:34.167 --> 40:35.501
They're having
so much fun out there.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.709
Oh, aren't they?
Oh, thank you so much.

40:36.709 --> 40:40.542
You're so welcome.

40:40.542 --> 40:41.751
-How's Lee's stuff?
-Done.

40:41.751 --> 40:43.459
Bless him, he pulled me aside

40:43.459 --> 40:46.292
and said that he hadn't
seen the laundry looking so good

40:46.292 --> 40:48.459
in a long while,
so I feel really great.

40:48.459 --> 40:49.584
Awesome.

40:49.584 --> 40:53.792
-Which one you going to?
-Back.

40:53.792 --> 40:58.626
[bleep] off, they were wet
from the water.

40:58.626 --> 40:59.918
You don't have to tell me that.

40:59.918 --> 41:03.584
"It was smelling like
a wet dog."

41:03.584 --> 41:06.459
And actually...

41:06.459 --> 41:08.542
That's not my mugs.
I only had one.

41:08.542 --> 41:16.626
I don't know
who the other mug is.

41:16.626 --> 41:18.584
I said, "Okay."

41:18.584 --> 41:20.834
I don't know whose other mug
it is, but I only had one mug.

41:20.834 --> 41:22.584
Rayna, you've gotta
stop giving me sh--

41:22.584 --> 41:23.792
every time I ask
you to do something.

41:23.792 --> 41:25.459
Can you not start with me?

41:25.459 --> 41:27.542
I could have easily just
put the coffee cups away,

41:27.542 --> 41:28.709
do you know what
I'm saying, like...

41:28.709 --> 41:30.292
No, you should put them away...

41:30.292 --> 41:31.584
Okay, I'm done with
the conversation.

41:31.584 --> 41:32.584
Why are you giving me sh--
all the time?

41:32.584 --> 41:34.167
Because I do...

41:34.167 --> 41:36.375
I'm not, but I do
everything for you.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.667
-But you know we've been...
-I do wash them for you.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.709
Wow.
Okay.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.292
You only give me sh--.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.292
With everyone else,
you're a kiss-ass.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.792
That's not true.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.542
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am,
yes, sir, no, sir.

41:45.542 --> 41:47.876
Because they're grown adults,
you're a child.

41:47.876 --> 41:49.250
Are you ----ing kidding me?

41:49.250 --> 41:51.250
Why are you arguing
with each other?

41:51.250 --> 41:52.667
Oh, my God.

41:52.667 --> 41:53.876
-Quiet.
-I'm trying to be nice to you.

41:53.876 --> 41:55.709
You're getting on
my damn nerves.

41:55.709 --> 41:57.542
This is yachting.
We have guests on board.

41:57.542 --> 42:00.167
What the [bleep]?

42:00.167 --> 42:02.167
Next, on "Below Deck"...

42:02.167 --> 42:04.501
Do you see how you don't
have the whole entire thing

42:04.501 --> 42:05.501
covered in plates of food?

42:05.501 --> 42:07.125
I wanted to show, like,

42:07.125 --> 42:09.375
what my expectation
for clearing a service is.

42:09.375 --> 42:11.250
I don't wanna let people down,

42:11.250 --> 42:14.250
but I think that I'm definitely
reaching my breaking point.

42:14.250 --> 42:19.542
We really need someone else to
just continue plowing through.

42:19.542 --> 42:22.542
Are they?

42:22.542 --> 42:24.459
You sit over here with
your back towards me.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.292
This is some weird sh--.

42:26.292 --> 42:33.709
Oh, wow, this looks lovely.

42:33.709 --> 42:35.292
I think Jake is so great.

42:35.292 --> 42:36.709
And I think you're
----ing beautiful.

42:36.709 --> 42:39.250
A moustache ride doesn't
sound all that bad.

42:39.250 --> 42:40.417
Aw, pumpkin.

42:40.417 --> 42:41.834
I mean, seriously?

42:41.834 --> 42:43.375
Look at this.

42:43.375 --> 42:45.751
-I want everything scrubbed.
-Okay.

42:45.751 --> 42:48.209
Eddie needs to get control
of his deck team yesterday,

42:48.209 --> 42:50.250
or I'm gonna start handing
out plane tickets.

42:50.250 --> 42:52.626
This is bullsh--.

42:52.626 --> 42:53.959
This is your final wake-up call.

42:53.959 --> 42:56.584
I wanna see people
being proactive,

42:56.584 --> 42:58.667
or people are
gonna lose their job.

42:58.667 --> 43:02.667
There are no more
second chances.
