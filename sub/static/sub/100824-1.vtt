WEBVTT

00:01.389 --> 00:05.389
(mesmerizing alternative music)

00:32.060 --> 00:35.710
- We all have over the last 24 hours or so

00:35.710 --> 00:40.473
slipped into a coma of
confusion and speculation.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.930
I've heard some of the
stories going around.

00:43.930 --> 00:46.613
They go from the divine to the absurd.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.313
I think this happened, or
I heard that this happened.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.150
What has actually happened
has been documented

00:56.290 --> 01:01.140
by the proper authorities,
and I give you my word,

01:01.140 --> 01:02.720
every bit of it is true.

01:03.655 --> 01:07.655
(mesmerizing alternative music)

01:48.289 --> 01:52.706
(moves into eerie alternative music)

02:35.865 --> 02:38.865
(crickets chirping)

02:43.054 --> 02:46.804
(ominous instrumental music)

03:12.742 --> 03:13.917
- Hmm...

03:15.084 --> 03:17.560
Do you that Socrates said
an unexamined life is...

03:17.560 --> 03:18.884
...not worth living?

03:22.420 --> 03:23.770
- Shut the fuck up, Harold.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.440
-  Has he changed his story?

03:35.440 --> 03:36.670
-  Nah.

03:36.670 --> 03:37.730
-  And the Sheriff?

03:37.730 --> 03:39.240
-  He's not happy about it.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.040
Besides the obvious conflict of interest,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.240
it's a federal case now.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.130
-  Poor bastard.

03:45.130 --> 03:45.963
-  Still reckon

03:45.963 --> 03:48.243
it's just a missing person situation?

03:49.350 --> 03:51.520
-  Until we find a body.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.373
-  I think you mean bodies.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.770
- So which one of you is the bad cop?

04:24.800 --> 04:25.853
- We're FBI.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.223
- What's the difference?

04:33.670 --> 04:36.200
- We're not into this whole small town,

04:36.200 --> 04:37.563
dick-measuring bullshit.

04:39.230 --> 04:40.633
So no good cop, bad cop.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.353
- Just cops cops.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.023
- Okay, so you're FBI.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.540
- We don't have a dog in this fight.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.640
That's why we're here.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.270
This is Agent Dixon, I'm Agent Costa.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.690
- You got a lot of priors, here.

05:02.690 --> 05:07.053
Petty theft, aggravated
assault, reckless endangerment.

05:09.750 --> 05:10.717
- That was a...

05:13.810 --> 05:18.433
That was, I was, I was a
different person back then.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.920
- So what happened between now and then?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.500
Seems like you've been a
ghost for what, six years?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.333
- Six years.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.337
- Yeah, something like that.

05:32.337 --> 05:36.973
- But there was no missing
persons report ever filed.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.160
- I guess I wasn't important enough.

05:44.870 --> 05:46.420
- Everyone's important, Joseph.

05:47.870 --> 05:49.323
Everyone and everything.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.203
It's all connected.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.253
Well, that's what I've found anyway.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.060
- Your buddy in the nextdoor room--

06:04.060 --> 06:05.283
- Not my buddy.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.943
- I can see how a guy like
that can get under your skin.

06:09.943 --> 06:11.720
- And we're gonna get the
story out of one of you,

06:11.720 --> 06:12.923
one way or the other.

06:15.565 --> 06:18.433
You seem smart enough, too
smart for this shitburg.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.530
- You really have no clue, do you?

06:30.565 --> 06:32.930
(quiet ominous music)

06:32.930 --> 06:35.623
It wasn't me, and it wasn't him.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.190
It was...

06:42.550 --> 06:43.393
What it was.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.223
- What what was, Joseph?

06:54.900 --> 06:55.813
- It was real.

06:58.530 --> 07:00.223
And nobody was ready for that.

This is just a friendly chat Dale.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.310
You don't mind if I call you Dale.

12:33.030 --> 12:35.590
Your pal has got one hell of a story.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.553
- What?

12:51.660 --> 12:54.053
What do you mean by that, what he is?

12:55.460 --> 12:58.093
- Who, I said who.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.630
I don't know who he is anymore.

13:02.010 --> 13:03.550
Especially after what I saw.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.670
- Yeah, who's on first, what's on second,

13:05.670 --> 13:10.670
I don't know's on third,
after what exactly, Dale?

13:18.510 --> 13:19.343
- Nevermind.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.223
Just forget it.

13:24.549 --> 13:25.382
- Oh Dale.

13:27.260 --> 13:30.363
You know there's some things
one can not just forget.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.660
-  Ah shit, my back!

13:34.660 --> 13:36.410
- Alan, oh my god, I'm sorry!

13:36.410 --> 13:37.670
- What happened?

13:37.670 --> 13:38.620
-  She threw the dart into my back,

13:38.620 --> 13:39.453
that's what happened.

13:39.453 --> 13:40.814
- I mean, what happened to the lights?

13:40.814 --> 13:41.647
- Oh my god.

13:41.647 --> 13:43.490
- Can somebody go get
the first aid kid, Tanya?

13:43.490 --> 13:47.390
- Let me help, I should put
my nursing degree to some use.

13:47.390 --> 13:50.013
- I got it, I messed it up, I'll fix it.

13:50.013 --> 13:51.040
- You got my beer?

13:51.040 --> 13:52.207
- Yeah, I got it.

13:54.980 --> 13:55.830
- My brother will know what to--

13:55.830 --> 13:57.620
- Your brother will know what to what?

13:57.620 --> 14:00.310
- What to do when a fuse
blows in this shit-box

14:00.310 --> 14:01.933
your daddy was so proud of.

14:08.810 --> 14:12.610
- You just keep my father's
name out of your mouth.

14:12.610 --> 14:13.443
- Or what?

14:13.443 --> 14:16.180
- It's not polite to speak
ill of the dead, Carl.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.013
- And?

14:18.270 --> 14:20.720
I spent my whole life being polite.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.720
I spent my whole life livin'

14:36.340 --> 14:39.829
while I was busy whipin' his
daddy's ass when the cancer--

14:39.829 --> 14:40.662
-  Stop it. -

14:40.662 --> 14:41.495
This guy, who couldn't even be bothered

14:42.460 --> 14:44.780
to come to his own father's funeral,

14:44.780 --> 14:46.930
and now I'm the one
that's gotta be polite?

14:51.010 --> 14:54.693
Come on, let's go fix this
'fore all the beer gets skunky.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.123
-  You seem a bit tense.

15:06.910 --> 15:08.640
Do you want some water?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.510
- I'm fine.

15:09.510 --> 15:10.660
-  Asprin?

15:11.750 --> 15:12.583
- I said I'm fine.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.223
- Are you sure, 'cause we
could be here for a while.

15:16.950 --> 15:17.783
- We'll see.

15:19.890 --> 15:21.440
- Plan on another vanishing act?

15:22.930 --> 15:25.430
Going to disappear again for what?

15:25.430 --> 15:26.320
- Six years.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.153
- Six years.

15:27.153 --> 15:28.570
- Yeah, so they tell me.

15:28.570 --> 15:31.900
So you've told me, repeatedly.

15:31.900 --> 15:32.733
- Told you?

15:34.580 --> 15:36.420
What do you mean by that?

15:36.420 --> 15:38.450
- What do you want me to say?

15:38.450 --> 15:41.803
- Nothing big, just the truth.

15:42.830 --> 15:46.910
- No, that's the last
thing you wanna hear.

15:46.910 --> 15:48.530
- Try us.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.270
- And you can start with, why did you need

15:51.270 --> 15:53.793
someone to tell you how
long you've been gone for?

15:56.028 --> 15:57.940
(crickets chirping)

15:57.940 --> 15:59.540
-  Whole house is out,

15:59.540 --> 16:01.070
so are the lights outside the garage,

16:01.070 --> 16:02.630
the whole street, I think something--

16:02.630 --> 16:05.473
- So it's not a fuse, yeah
we got that already, thanks.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.603
- Well, this one's out.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.466
- Yeah, mine.

16:13.466 --> 16:14.380
- Mine too.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.760
- Mighta if you'd changed the
the batteries this decade.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.803
- That doesn't make sense, I'm sure that--

16:17.803 --> 16:20.200
- Denny, didn't Dad have
some candles around here?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.800
Somebody call the power company.

16:25.650 --> 16:28.330
- That's weird, my phone is dead too.

16:28.330 --> 16:29.510
- You shoulda charged it babe.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.560
- I did, like an hour ago.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.550
- Why don't you make
yourself useful, you call.

16:34.550 --> 16:35.840
-  Don't have one.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.400
- Who doesn't have a Smartphone?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.855
- I don't know, a smart person maybe.

16:39.855 --> 16:41.180
- Mine's dead too.
- Mine's dead too.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.110
- Okay, everything electrical's out,

16:43.110 --> 16:45.200
even stuff with batteries?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.380
- Alright wait, this has
gotta be a coincidence.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.690
- There's a landline out in the garage,

16:48.690 --> 16:50.930
I'll check that, and a
generator in the shed,

16:50.930 --> 16:52.620
I'll see if there's some gas in it.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.313
- Good to see you can be useful.

16:56.030 --> 16:58.180
- Denny, why don't you
come give me a hand?

16:59.090 --> 17:00.764
- You heard the man.

17:00.764 --> 17:03.347
(door squeaks)

17:08.108 --> 17:10.858
(crickets chirp)

17:20.720 --> 17:21.920
- This is what it's come down to,

17:21.920 --> 17:23.586
the Campbells spreading
all over everything

17:23.586 --> 17:25.000
Dad built like some kind of mold?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.670
- It's done Joseph, it's time to move on.

17:27.670 --> 17:28.623
- To where?

17:30.140 --> 17:31.790
- I figured I would ask you that,

17:31.790 --> 17:33.683
you're the expert on movin' on.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.160
- That's not fair.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.350
- Joe, you left me here
alone when Dad was sick,

17:39.350 --> 17:41.480
what was I supposed to do?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.610
The Campbells were there, you weren't.

17:43.610 --> 17:46.110
- And now they've come
to collect, is that it?

17:46.110 --> 17:49.300
- You can't just show up after six years,

17:49.300 --> 17:50.500
refuse to tell anybody where you--

17:50.500 --> 17:51.333
- It's complicated.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.360
- It's not complicated!

17:52.360 --> 17:54.650
You pick up the phone, you
tell us you're still alive!

17:54.650 --> 17:57.963
We had a funeral for you
Joseph, we buried a suit.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.550
- But why them?

18:00.550 --> 18:03.493
They already own the whole goddamn town.

18:04.590 --> 18:07.053
(Joseph sighs)

18:07.053 --> 18:09.470
(clattering)

18:10.888 --> 18:14.721
- And so what would you
have done in my shoes?

18:17.790 --> 18:20.130
- I'm not saying I have the answer,

18:20.130 --> 18:21.830
but we both know this can't be it.

18:25.740 --> 18:28.273
- You know, you oughta save
the sermon for the Reverend.

18:32.288 --> 18:34.705
(clattering)

18:36.660 --> 18:37.493
Try it now.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.007
(engine starts)

18:54.628 --> 18:58.378
(crickets and cicadas chirp)

19:10.682 --> 19:14.015
(key turns in ignition)

19:35.537 --> 19:39.287
(ominous instrumental music)

19:55.914 --> 19:58.414
(phone dials)

20:00.204 --> 20:01.037
(phone ringing)

20:04.478 --> 20:06.161
(phone ringing

20:08.948 --> 20:10.531
- Sheriff Campbell.

20:12.113 --> 20:14.000
-  Ray.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.843
- That's right, who am I speaking with?

20:17.465 --> 20:19.800
-  Ray it's Joseph, Joseph Byrne.

20:26.215 --> 20:29.083
- Joseph Byrne, really.

20:30.065 --> 20:31.265
-  In the flesh.

20:33.385 --> 20:35.190
-  Where're
you calling me from, Joseph?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.503
- From the shop in my garage.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.433
- In your garage.

20:43.460 --> 20:44.893
Well that is a surprise.

20:47.490 --> 20:48.890
How long you been back, Joe?

20:52.980 --> 20:53.883
- Couple days.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.173
I've got to, I've gotta
sign the transfer papers.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.150
The power's out.

21:01.150 --> 21:02.243
- Your power.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.120
Your power's out, huh?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.347
Well that's fucked up.

21:07.650 --> 21:08.733
- Yeah it is.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.680
Is anybody else having problems?

21:12.680 --> 21:15.113
- I don't know, it's the first I've heard.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.140
First I'm hearing about a lot of things.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.980
Do Carl and Dale know you're back?

21:26.370 --> 21:27.203
Joseph?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.553
Joseph?

21:33.730 --> 21:35.833
I said do my brothers know you're back.

21:38.184 --> 21:42.120
(strange metallic screeching)

21:42.120 --> 21:45.410
- Yeah, yeah I'd say they're aware.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.963
They're over here helping
with the uh, transition.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.850
- Well, it's a little late for me

21:54.850 --> 21:56.860
to drive that far out of town right now,

21:56.860 --> 22:00.557
and um, Harold's probably
drunk by now, so.

22:02.930 --> 22:06.340
Why don't I make a few
calls and see if we can get

22:06.340 --> 22:08.753
somebody out your way in the morning.

22:10.270 --> 22:11.103
- I gotta go.

22:19.477 --> 22:21.894
(chattering noise)

22:26.724 --> 22:30.474
(distant undulating humming)

22:37.012 --> 22:39.429
(chattering noise)

22:43.323 --> 22:46.156
(distant humming)

22:47.429 --> 22:50.179
(frogs croaking)

24:09.949 --> 24:11.616
What's done is done.

24:13.268 --> 24:14.601
Time to move on.

24:19.774 --> 24:21.681
(strange metallic screeching)

24:21.681 --> 24:24.681
(crickets chirping)

24:27.510 --> 24:29.223
- So your brother was a mechanic?

24:32.550 --> 24:34.560
- What do you mean, was?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.393
- You tell us.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.870
- My brother is a prophet.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.587
- Who fixed cars?

24:41.587 --> 24:44.670
(Agent Costa laughs)

24:46.320 --> 24:48.770
- A prophet is without
honor in his home country.

24:49.619 --> 24:50.800
- Yeah.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.130
Tell that to Jim Jones

24:52.130 --> 24:54.030
and the rest of the Kool-Aid drinkers.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.000
- I thought he was the comedian.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.070
- No, no, she (laughs),
she has her moments.

25:00.070 --> 25:02.213
Tell us a little more
about your brother Carl.

25:03.230 --> 25:04.763
The mechanic prophet.

25:08.950 --> 25:11.403
- You know, a man can be
more than just one thing.

25:13.290 --> 25:14.290
Carl taught me that.

25:15.310 --> 25:16.143
- Fair enough.

25:18.820 --> 25:19.983
So where is he now?

25:23.275 --> 25:26.275
(mellow rock music)

25:30.964 --> 25:35.547
(whispering)
(kissing)

25:38.840 --> 25:40.870
- What's taking so long, you think?

25:40.870 --> 25:43.067
- Oh, maybe he did one of
his Houdini acts again.

25:43.067 --> 25:43.900
(Tanya laughs)

25:43.900 --> 25:45.880
Let's hope this time he
signed the papers first.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.260
(Tanya laughs)

25:47.260 --> 25:48.093
- Don't you think it's weird

25:48.093 --> 25:50.840
that nothing electrical's working?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.030
-  The generator's working.

25:52.030 --> 25:53.710
- That runs on gas.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.542
- Duh, the power's out.

25:55.542 --> 25:58.023
- I mean nothing, like
even stuff with batteries.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.883
You ever heard of a neutron bomb?

26:03.290 --> 26:05.020
It's like an A-bomb.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.770
It only fries electronics.

26:07.770 --> 26:10.870
It keeps the buildings
standing, the people okay.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.533
- Who'd do something like that?

26:14.140 --> 26:17.100
- A lotta people hate America,
especially these days.

26:17.100 --> 26:20.230
- Right so,uh, uh, Long Duk Dong,

26:20.230 --> 26:21.480
(laughter)

26:21.480 --> 26:23.571
he dropped a bomb on us?

26:23.571 --> 26:25.150
- (laughs) Long Duk Dong?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.930
- Yeah, that midget
dictator from North Korea.

26:27.930 --> 26:28.943
- It's Kim Jong-un.

26:29.851 --> 26:31.930
Long Duk Dong is from Sixteen Candles.

26:31.930 --> 26:33.880
- Alright, well you know who I mean, okay,

26:33.880 --> 26:37.960
so, so Kim Jon-dong, he
got himself a neutra bomb

26:37.960 --> 26:40.080
and he decided the best
place to explode it

26:40.080 --> 26:41.920
is Upper Broome County?

26:41.920 --> 26:42.860
That's ridonkulous.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.570
- What if it's not just here,
what if it's everywhere?

26:44.570 --> 26:46.270
- It can't be everywhere, we'd have heard

26:46.270 --> 26:47.103
something about it.

26:47.103 --> 26:48.113
- Lock it up.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.240
- Yeah Dennis, lock it up.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.050
- All of you lock it
up, I'm getting stupider

26:54.050 --> 26:55.460
just listening to you.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.293
- But the power--

26:56.293 --> 26:58.170
- You wanna hear about power?

26:58.170 --> 27:00.113
You wanna hear about real power?

27:01.100 --> 27:03.700
Tell me, who is it you thinks got

27:03.700 --> 27:05.223
the most power in this town?

27:06.832 --> 27:08.730
- (snaps fingers) Your dad.

27:08.730 --> 27:12.230
- You'd think so, but not really.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.010
Sure, he's got a way with words,

27:15.010 --> 27:17.600
sure he packs 'em in every Sunday.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.910
Sin all you want, just so long as you have

27:20.910 --> 27:24.587
a personal relationship
with Christ (laughs).

27:26.690 --> 27:30.320
Meanwhile, those people
that actually do good things

27:30.320 --> 27:32.820
in this world, well fuck 'em, right?

27:32.820 --> 27:35.310
Fuck 'em if they don't fit your mold.

27:35.310 --> 27:37.130
- What does this have to do with Dad?

27:37.130 --> 27:39.010
What does this have to do with anything?

27:39.010 --> 27:40.840
- Oh Dad, right.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.530
Well, he's a servant of the Lord.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.790
Just another servant.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.130
And he'd tell you the same thing.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.760
A servant following some instructions

27:50.760 --> 27:52.943
in a 2,000 year old book.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.453
So who's got the real power in this town?

28:00.410 --> 28:01.300
Me.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.203
Tell 'em Dennis.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.300
- Me?

28:05.300 --> 28:06.203
- Yeah, you.

28:09.510 --> 28:10.413
Ever read that?

28:13.026 --> 28:15.070
- Uh, Wise Blood.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.370
- Right, Flannery O'Connor.

28:17.370 --> 28:19.088
She's a prophet.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.500
It was your brother Joseph gave me that

28:21.500 --> 28:23.620
before he went walk-about.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.223
Back when I was the good boy.

28:26.110 --> 28:28.610
I've read it a hundred
times if I've read it once.

28:29.560 --> 28:34.560
It's about understanding, it's
about knowin' what's what,

28:34.893 --> 28:38.550
it's about truth, capital T truth.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.430
- Truth?

28:39.430 --> 28:41.370
- There are all kinds of truth,

28:41.370 --> 28:44.150
but behind all of them,
there is only one truth,

28:44.150 --> 28:47.553
and that is that there's no truth.

28:49.220 --> 28:53.703
Now that I own this garage,
I'm the one with the power.

28:54.830 --> 28:59.250
I'm the one who saves
souls, and that's the truth.

28:59.250 --> 29:03.350
- We fix cars, Carl, not souls.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.143
-  Turn to page
47, I've got it marked.

29:11.048 --> 29:14.715
- "A man with a good
car need no redemption.

29:16.117 --> 29:20.707
"Nobody with a good car
needs to be justified."

29:24.750 --> 29:26.260
- I don't get it.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.870
- You see, a man who doesn't obey the law,

29:28.870 --> 29:31.400
well, he's an outlaw.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.850
A man who doesn't obey
a God, he's just normal.

29:35.850 --> 29:38.040
Heck, a man who doesn't
even believe in God

29:38.040 --> 29:40.810
is just someone who's
got a different opinion.

29:40.810 --> 29:45.243
But a man without a car,
well he's nothin' at all.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.650
- A man without a car is
just a man without a car.

29:49.650 --> 29:50.740
- Really?

29:50.740 --> 29:52.800
How far can you go without a car?

29:52.800 --> 29:55.610
How far away is the closest
store from here, six miles?

29:55.610 --> 29:57.470
You gonna walk that every day?

29:57.470 --> 29:59.103
You might as well be a caveman.

30:00.230 --> 30:03.340
You got a car, you've got
what people 150 years ago

30:03.340 --> 30:05.043
would think was magic.

30:06.070 --> 30:11.070
It would count as 20 servants,
20 slaves, more even!

30:11.640 --> 30:15.440
Servants, slaves.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.413
That's power.

30:18.770 --> 30:19.863
Being a servant?

30:21.750 --> 30:23.223
That's for suckers.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.763
- This is a service station, Carl.

30:28.997 --> 30:32.080
(soulful rock music)

30:45.741 --> 30:46.574
- Grace.

30:48.570 --> 30:50.113
- Shh, you're okay.

30:51.210 --> 30:52.083
- What day is it?

30:53.400 --> 30:54.653
- It's Thursday.

30:56.020 --> 30:56.853
- What date?

30:59.670 --> 31:01.350
- What do you mean?

31:01.350 --> 31:02.230
- What date?

31:02.230 --> 31:04.640
- Okay!
(strange metallic screeching)

31:04.640 --> 31:05.473
- I'm sorry.

31:07.070 --> 31:08.559
I'm sorry.

31:08.559 --> 31:11.392
(heavy breathing)

31:13.710 --> 31:14.743
What happened?

31:16.353 --> 31:18.840
- You hit your head.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.240
Think it happened when
you stepped on that trap.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.100
- Why are there traps up here?

31:25.100 --> 31:25.933
- I don't know.

31:27.730 --> 31:29.080
- You shouldn't be up here.

31:29.940 --> 31:33.790
- I'm pregnant Joseph, I'm not an invalid.

31:33.790 --> 31:37.879
You, you'll be okay.

31:37.879 --> 31:41.010
I still wanna get you to a hospital.

31:41.010 --> 31:43.380
- We can't, the cars are dead.

31:43.380 --> 31:44.690
- All of them?

31:44.690 --> 31:45.990
- Anything with a battery.

31:51.530 --> 31:53.620
- You'll be okay, least 'til tomorrow

31:53.620 --> 31:55.923
when things are back to normal.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.553
- You and Dale.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.783
- Me and Dale.

32:13.077 --> 32:14.550
- And Dale Junior.

32:14.550 --> 32:15.770
- Joseph, don't.

32:15.770 --> 32:18.203
- You think Dale's gonna be a good dad?

32:19.120 --> 32:20.723
- I think he's a good man.

32:22.205 --> 32:24.060
He's not perfect, but who is?

32:24.060 --> 32:25.990
- I'm sorry, I just never imagined you

32:25.990 --> 32:27.513
joining the Campbell clan.

32:28.490 --> 32:31.285
- Well, I never pictured you
disappearing for six years.

32:31.285 --> 32:35.285
(melancholy instrumental music)

32:40.445 --> 32:41.862
Where did you go?

32:48.146 --> 32:49.396
- I don't know.

33:08.297 --> 33:09.973
- Why don't you have a seat.

33:12.070 --> 33:14.153
-  I feel like stretching my legs.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.580
- Feel like stretching the truth, too?

33:17.580 --> 33:19.730
- Seems like a running
theme today, is all.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.040
-  That's not my style.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.040
- Telling the truth.

33:24.040 --> 33:24.873
- No, running.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.190
- Odd thing to say for
a guy who's been AWOL

33:28.190 --> 33:29.890
for over half a decade.

33:29.890 --> 33:30.929
- Yeah, now that sounds like a lot

33:30.929 --> 33:32.080
of running if you ask me.

33:32.080 --> 33:32.913
- Mm-hmm.

33:34.770 --> 33:35.720
- Nobody asked you.

33:40.840 --> 33:41.900
- Why don't we try this?

33:41.900 --> 33:44.550
You drop the stoic, tough guy bullshit

33:44.550 --> 33:45.900
and just tell us the truth.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.993
The truth, Joseph.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.773
It can go a long way.

33:57.907 --> 34:01.470
(soft folk music)

34:01.470 --> 34:03.370
- What's with the traps in the garage?

34:04.840 --> 34:05.673
- Traps?

34:07.560 --> 34:08.393
I didn't put any--

34:08.393 --> 34:09.226
- I did.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.183
- You?

34:14.590 --> 34:16.500
- Yeah, been noticing a lotta

34:16.500 --> 34:18.383
'coons lurking around town lately.

34:19.470 --> 34:20.370
- Coons.

34:20.370 --> 34:24.350
- Yeah, can't be too
careful with them coons.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.160
Lots of people think they're cute,

34:26.160 --> 34:27.533
especially the young ones.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.970
- We've never had a problem before.

34:30.970 --> 34:33.063
- And I'm not too keen on having one now.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.080
- What were you doing up there anyway?

34:37.080 --> 34:38.230
- Callin' your brother.

34:39.295 --> 34:40.580
- Did you get a hold of him?

34:40.580 --> 34:41.413
- Yeah, he said he's gonna--

34:41.413 --> 34:43.560
- No, I mean what were
you doing in the loft?

34:43.560 --> 34:45.530
That's not where the phone is,

34:45.530 --> 34:47.030
but it is where the traps are.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.250
- I heard something up there.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.863
- Something or someone?

34:56.550 --> 34:57.383
- I don't know.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.410
- You heard him boys.

34:59.410 --> 35:00.370
Time to go coon hunting.

35:00.370 --> 35:01.873
- Gun's in the truck.

35:02.780 --> 35:04.203
Stand your ground brothers!

35:06.432 --> 35:09.130
- I got a right to protect what's mine.

35:09.130 --> 35:09.963
- I'll go too.

35:13.970 --> 35:15.270
Just to be sure it's okay.

35:18.760 --> 35:19.653
- This is wrong.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.833
- I suggest you step back right now.

35:25.010 --> 35:26.163
- Let me go out there.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.790
- I think it's best if you just stay here

35:29.790 --> 35:31.140
with the rest of the women.

35:41.603 --> 35:44.520
- To hell with this, I'm goin' too.

35:50.414 --> 35:53.034
- Cooey!

35:53.034 --> 35:54.426
Cooey coon!

35:55.593 --> 35:57.143
Come on out, little coony coon.

35:58.270 --> 36:02.353
(suspenseful instrumental music)

36:11.570 --> 36:13.320
- You don't think they'll actually shoot

36:13.320 --> 36:15.007
whoever's out there, do you?

36:15.007 --> 36:17.387
- You heard the man, who's gonna stop him?

36:19.180 --> 36:21.000
- Somebody has to.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.280
-  Let's just find 'em
and get the hell out of here.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.230
- Where's the fun in that?

36:25.230 --> 36:27.210
- Come on out, little coon,

36:27.210 --> 36:30.010
show us that scary little coon face!

36:30.010 --> 36:32.432
Show us how you like to beg!

36:32.432 --> 36:33.490
Cooey!

36:33.490 --> 36:35.000
Coon!

36:35.000 --> 36:37.222
Come on out, little coony coon.

36:37.222 --> 36:38.802
- Carl come on, this isn't you.

36:38.802 --> 36:41.709
- You haven't been payin'
much attention, have you.

36:41.709 --> 36:43.655
- Carl!

36:43.655 --> 36:46.405
Over there!

36:51.173 --> 36:54.506
(heavy breathing)
- Hey.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.620
Just come down, we
don't wanna start any trouble.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.613
- We don't wanna start, but you
better believe we'll end it.

37:03.010 --> 37:07.713
- Carl, I don't think that thing is human.

37:09.180 --> 37:11.525
- Now you're gettin' with the program.

37:11.525 --> 37:13.775
(gun shot)

37:14.698 --> 37:15.600
- I'm gonna go out there.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.230
- No, no, that's too dangerous.

37:18.230 --> 37:19.870
- So?

37:19.870 --> 37:21.870
- They're drunk and trigger happy.

37:21.870 --> 37:24.870
You can't go out there and risk
your life for some stranger.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.570
- I don't know if it is a stranger.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.850
- (laughs) That'll teach those coons

37:30.850 --> 37:32.460
to sniff around here.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.817
- Carl, you just killed someone.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.610
- I thought you said it wasn't human.

37:37.610 --> 37:40.000
Dale come on, help me
scoop up what's left,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.850
Alan you give Ray a call,
tell him we got some trash

37:42.850 --> 37:44.433
that needs to be disposed of.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.677
- What do you mean, it?

37:48.677 --> 37:50.513
What did you see out there?

37:52.420 --> 37:53.253
- Nothing.

37:53.253 --> 37:54.173
- Joseph.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.580
- I didn't see anything,

37:59.220 --> 38:01.020
but I think I know what's out there.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.763
- Does this have something
to do with where you went?

38:08.295 --> 38:09.878
- More like when.

38:16.393 --> 38:19.143
- Dennis, did you see what I saw?

38:20.220 --> 38:21.860
- I don't know.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.487
Either way, I wish I didn't.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.300
-  Coon was craftier than I thought.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.690
-  For Christ's sake Carl,

38:28.690 --> 38:29.660
can't you see that's not a--

38:29.660 --> 38:31.900
- For Christ's sake, some nerve.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.820
You think Christ gives one flying--

38:33.820 --> 38:35.010
- Carl!
- Fuck about what goes on

38:35.010 --> 38:36.130
down here?
- Carl!

38:36.130 --> 38:38.940
- We're on our little buddy,
sorry to break it to you.

38:38.940 --> 38:40.297
Survival of the fittest.

38:40.297 --> 38:41.130
- Carl.

38:41.130 --> 38:42.338
- Not now!

38:42.338 --> 38:44.970
- Carl, shut up and look.

38:44.970 --> 38:49.970
(fearful breathing)
(ominous instrumental music)

38:58.916 --> 38:59.749
- My God.

39:04.404 --> 39:06.654
(gun shot)

39:08.290 --> 39:09.123
- It?

39:10.520 --> 39:11.563
- Yeah, it.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.600
- Would you care to elaborate on that?

39:15.600 --> 39:16.433
- Elaborate?

39:18.470 --> 39:19.620
What's to elaborate on?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.660
What part of it don't you understand?

39:22.660 --> 39:24.510
- It's just the part where it sounds like

39:24.510 --> 39:27.270
you and your buddies, you
drunk too much toilet gin,

39:27.270 --> 39:28.790
then you did something
you shouldn't have done,

39:28.790 --> 39:32.183
and then you tried to cover it up.

39:34.190 --> 39:37.773
- Other than that, what's the
expression, total crystal?

39:38.610 --> 39:41.202
- Well you guys got all the answers.

39:41.202 --> 39:42.280
What you need me for?

39:42.280 --> 39:43.393
- No, no, no, no.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.523
It's you that needs us.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.750
- So why don't we try it one more time.

39:49.750 --> 39:54.473
Would you care to elaborate
on that, on the "it" part?

40:01.755 --> 40:03.790
- Can I get a cup of that coffee now?

40:03.790 --> 40:04.623
- This coffee?

40:05.760 --> 40:08.853
Trust me, you don't
want any of this coffee.

40:09.850 --> 40:11.150
- No, don't, don't look at me.

40:11.150 --> 40:11.987
I'm a tea guy.

40:15.126 --> 40:18.543
- So, once again, with feeling this time.

40:22.614 --> 40:27.614
(pained breathing)
(dramatic instrumental music)

40:29.980 --> 40:30.940
- Some thing?

40:30.940 --> 40:31.773
- You heard me.

40:31.773 --> 40:33.000
- And he shot Alan?

40:33.000 --> 40:34.270
- It's not a he, it's a--

40:34.270 --> 40:36.810
- I shot him, okay, I did
it, can we just get him

40:36.810 --> 40:38.020
to the hospital, okay.

40:38.020 --> 40:38.853
- We can't.

40:38.853 --> 40:39.686
- What do you mean, we can't?

40:39.686 --> 40:41.010
- The cars won't start, remember.

40:41.010 --> 40:42.790
- The generator, we'll jump one.

40:42.790 --> 40:44.030
- It won't fix the batteries.

40:44.030 --> 40:45.410
-  Neutron bomb, I'm telling ya.

40:45.410 --> 40:46.410
- Dennis, shut up!

40:46.410 --> 40:49.010
- You're a nurse, can't you
get the bullet out of his leg?

40:49.010 --> 40:50.100
- This isn't a movie Carl,

40:50.100 --> 40:51.847
taking out that bullet could kill him.

40:51.847 --> 40:54.850
(pained yelling)

40:54.850 --> 40:56.080
- She's right, we need to get
him to the emergency room.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.530
We could call your brother.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.090
- Nobody goes outside!

40:59.090 --> 41:00.080
- We could rig up one of those old wagons,

41:00.080 --> 41:03.990
it's only five miles away--
- I said nobody goes outside!

41:03.990 --> 41:05.100
At least not until dawn.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.820
- Carl, if we don't get him
to a hospital, he could die!

41:07.820 --> 41:10.341
- If we go outside, we all die.

41:10.341 --> 41:13.091
(pained yelling)

41:14.999 --> 41:16.449
- What did you see out there?

41:17.320 --> 41:20.283
- Something that human
eyes were not meant to see.

41:21.210 --> 41:24.433
Dad was right, he was right all along.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.383
- About what?

41:30.360 --> 41:31.193
- Demons.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.388
I'm talkin' about demons.

41:38.835 --> 41:41.835
(crickets chirping)

41:48.530 --> 41:50.290
We make it through the night.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.870
It'll hide and we can get some place safe.

41:52.870 --> 41:55.080
- How can you possibly know that?

41:55.080 --> 41:56.003
- Oh, I know.

41:57.926 --> 42:00.733
- It isn't here to hurt
us, not like you think.

42:01.710 --> 42:03.530
- And how the hell would you know that?

42:03.530 --> 42:04.630
You weren't out there.

42:06.330 --> 42:08.080
What aren't you tellin' us, Joseph?

42:16.190 --> 42:17.663
You aren't going anywhere.

42:22.570 --> 42:26.223
- Look, if I die, I die.

42:27.640 --> 42:28.973
What are you so afraid of?

42:29.960 --> 42:31.420
- I don't have to run from anything,

42:31.420 --> 42:33.253
because I don't believe in anything.

42:35.110 --> 42:38.520
- I'm the one who gave you
that book Carl, remember?

42:38.520 --> 42:40.620
- And for that, you have my thanks.

42:40.620 --> 42:42.200
- Carl, please put the gun down.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.700
- Do not doubt for one second
that I will do everything

42:44.700 --> 42:47.283
in my power to protect
what is deemed righteous.

42:49.120 --> 42:49.953
- Fine.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.993
- Well, we know he didn't shoot.

42:57.130 --> 42:58.640
I mean, obviously you're still here,

42:58.640 --> 42:59.620
so if you're going for tension,

42:59.620 --> 43:01.720
you kinda deflated that a bit.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.430
- You asked me what happened,
I'm telling you what happened.

43:04.430 --> 43:07.463
- Sure, but are you telling
us all that happened?

43:08.500 --> 43:10.763
- It's all connected, Joseph.

43:12.030 --> 43:13.053
All connected.

43:15.950 --> 43:18.550
- And that's what this
is about for you, right?

43:18.550 --> 43:20.063
Drawing the connections?

43:21.630 --> 43:23.230
- We don't draw the connections.

43:24.070 --> 43:25.323
Not us, not you.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.040
They're already there.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.650
All we do is shine a light.

43:30.650 --> 43:31.990
All we do is--

43:31.990 --> 43:33.440
- Try to draw them out of me.

43:39.291 --> 43:41.041
- And is that so bad?

43:43.737 --> 43:46.320
(Tanya crying)

43:58.520 --> 44:00.003
- He's gonna die, isn't he?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.493
- He's lost a lot of blood.

44:11.730 --> 44:13.830
- You think that thing was what Carl said?

44:15.663 --> 44:16.496
- A demon?

44:20.520 --> 44:21.523
I didn't see it.

44:24.287 --> 44:26.110
But the way they describe it...

44:29.920 --> 44:31.670
- They saw what they wanted to see.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.173
They saw what was in their hearts.

44:37.933 --> 44:40.516
(Tanya crying)

44:48.800 --> 44:51.300
- I don't think I'm ready
to be judged by God yet.

45:01.318 --> 45:02.235
- You okay?

45:03.440 --> 45:04.410
- Okay?

45:04.410 --> 45:06.360
Are you insane?

45:06.360 --> 45:08.860
Your brother's bleeding to death,

45:08.860 --> 45:10.373
there's some thing
crawling around out there

45:10.373 --> 45:12.610
that Carl thinks is a
demon, and he's got us

45:12.610 --> 45:13.580
trapped in here at gun point,

45:13.580 --> 45:15.980
what part of any of that
could possibly be okay?

45:16.829 --> 45:17.662
- Gracie, listen--

45:17.662 --> 45:18.963
- Don't Gracie me.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.010
Your brother has gone off the rails,

45:22.010 --> 45:24.600
and there you are, backing
him up like always.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.240
- He's trying to protect us.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.340
- Oh, the who's gonna protect us from him?

45:30.180 --> 45:32.523
- Listen, I know you're scared, okay?

45:33.370 --> 45:34.683
But he's my brother.

45:36.130 --> 45:38.453
He's never steered me wrong before.

45:39.700 --> 45:40.723
- Maybe he has.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.343
Maybe you just didn't notice.

45:44.216 --> 45:46.549
(loud thud)

45:52.090 --> 45:54.703
- So what did you find upstairs?

45:55.600 --> 45:57.130
- Jack shit.

45:57.130 --> 45:58.430
- Jack shit?

45:58.430 --> 45:59.720
Yeah, I don't think I know him,

45:59.720 --> 46:01.570
shit, is that a common
family name around here?

46:01.570 --> 46:02.810
Can I borrow your pen?

46:02.810 --> 46:07.590
Shit, how do you spell that,
is it with an Sch or an Sh?

46:07.590 --> 46:10.190
- Boy, you're a real live one, aren't you?

46:10.190 --> 46:11.050
- Uh, You know that's a good point.

46:11.050 --> 46:12.710
Maybe the question is,
who that was with you

46:12.710 --> 46:16.000
that night is still a live
one, and who is a dead one?

46:16.000 --> 46:17.210
- You know what?

46:17.210 --> 46:18.190
That's not funny.

46:18.190 --> 46:19.500
- None of this is funny, Dale.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.250
- Then why are you treating
it all like it's some joke!

46:23.100 --> 46:25.000
- We've just been following your lead.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.600
If you think it's time
to play nice with us,

46:30.970 --> 46:32.507
we can return the favor.

46:40.950 --> 46:45.950
(mournful instrumental music)
(Dale crying)

46:51.890 --> 46:53.672
-  Help me prop him up a bit.

46:53.672 --> 46:54.505
(grunting)

46:54.505 --> 46:57.249
Sorry, it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

46:57.249 --> 46:59.560
(heavy breathing)

46:59.560 --> 47:00.393
Just hang in there, alright?

47:00.393 --> 47:02.313
Just hang in a little longer.

47:03.168 --> 47:04.910
- Water.

47:04.910 --> 47:06.110
-  Okay, alright.

47:10.830 --> 47:11.663
- Hey baby.

47:12.661 --> 47:13.579
- Tanya.

47:13.579 --> 47:15.412
- Yeah babe, I'm here.

47:16.595 --> 47:17.428
- You.

47:20.137 --> 47:20.970
- Yeah.

47:21.920 --> 47:22.753
- You...

47:24.578 --> 47:27.352
...and Carl.

47:31.869 --> 47:33.211
- You know?

47:36.999 --> 47:39.582
(Tanya crying)

47:41.629 --> 47:42.832
- Shh.

47:42.832 --> 47:47.818
Hey, hey, shh....

47:47.818 --> 47:49.610
Don't cry.

47:49.610 --> 47:51.421
- Why didn't you say somethin'?

47:51.421 --> 47:53.453
Why didn't you smack me upside my head?

47:56.720 --> 47:58.387
- 'Cause I love you.

48:00.020 --> 48:01.962
I couldn't lose you.

48:01.962 --> 48:05.330
(Tanya crying)

48:05.330 --> 48:07.623
I love you even though you...

48:10.185 --> 48:12.031
Even though you shot me.

48:12.031 --> 48:15.198
(hysterical laughter)

48:20.973 --> 48:21.806
- Baby.

48:24.491 --> 48:29.491
- I love you, Tanya.

48:29.567 --> 48:30.823
- You forgive me?

48:35.733 --> 48:37.813
No, no, no, no!

48:39.863 --> 48:40.696
No!

48:43.434 --> 48:46.267
(agonized scream)

48:51.550 --> 48:55.300
(ominous instrumental music)

49:35.537 --> 49:40.003
(high-pitched synthetic notes)

49:40.003 --> 49:41.113
- Take me back.

49:43.960 --> 49:44.793
Please.

49:47.470 --> 49:48.423
I understand now.

50:01.900 --> 50:02.733
Tanya.

50:27.343 --> 50:28.573
- Damn it, Dennis!

50:29.610 --> 50:32.310
Isn't it enough that one
person's gotten shot tonight?

50:33.320 --> 50:35.670
- Your brother's gonna
get us all killed, Dale.

50:37.150 --> 50:38.650
- I wouldn't worry about Carl.

50:39.580 --> 50:41.330
Carl's always done the right thing.

50:43.170 --> 50:44.203
- Tell that to Alan.

50:45.230 --> 50:48.860
- Alan's fine, it's just a flesh wound.

50:48.860 --> 50:49.693
My brother's going to get--

50:49.693 --> 50:51.400
- Alan's your brother too.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.803
- I said he'll be fine!

51:03.644 --> 51:04.723
- You see anything?

51:06.620 --> 51:08.693
- Nothing that isn't supposed to be there.

51:14.865 --> 51:16.880
- You know this used to be my father's--

51:16.880 --> 51:20.730
well, my parents' room before...

51:29.300 --> 51:31.713
- This is, it's just temporary.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.663
You know, me and Grace staying here.

51:38.017 --> 51:39.320
- You know when it comes right down to it,

51:39.320 --> 51:40.960
everything's just temporary.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.613
- I need to talk to my brother.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.040
- Nobody's stoppin' you--

51:46.040 --> 51:46.873
- Alone.

51:57.535 --> 51:59.280
- What happened?

51:59.280 --> 52:00.293
- It came for me.

52:01.154 --> 52:02.780
It came for me downstairs.

52:02.780 --> 52:04.634
I was just sitting there.

52:04.634 --> 52:07.551
(steady heartbeat)

52:14.030 --> 52:17.613
(eerie instrumental music)

52:21.320 --> 52:23.543
- I'm ashamed to call you my brother.

52:26.891 --> 52:29.570
We always knew you weren't
strong enough for this.

52:29.570 --> 52:30.750
- Stop saying that.

52:31.780 --> 52:33.460
You're not supposed to be saying that.

52:33.460 --> 52:36.960
- I know exactly what I'm
supposed to be saying!

52:36.960 --> 52:40.283
I know exactly what I'm
supposed to be doing!

52:42.750 --> 52:46.160
And by God, you should too by now.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.650
- I do know.

52:47.650 --> 52:48.563
I do!

52:53.130 --> 52:54.890
- Prove yourself.

52:54.890 --> 52:56.023
- I am the shepherd,

52:56.920 --> 52:59.203
and I have sheep that
are not of this flock.

53:00.200 --> 53:04.340
I must bring them also, and
they will heed my voice,

53:04.340 --> 53:05.960
so there will be one flock.
- So there will be one flock.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.950
- One shepherd.
- One shepherd.

53:07.950 --> 53:09.880
- For this reason--
- For that reason.

53:09.880 --> 53:11.292
- My father loves me.
- My father loves me.

53:11.292 --> 53:12.690
- For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.087
- For thine is the kingdom--
- Forever.

53:14.087 --> 53:15.795
- The power, and the glory.
- For thine is the kingdom,

53:15.795 --> 53:18.683
and the power, and the glory.

53:18.683 --> 53:20.570
Forever and ever.
- And the glory.

53:20.570 --> 53:21.403
- Amen.

53:21.403 --> 53:24.513
- Forever and ever, amen.

53:25.490 --> 53:28.383
For this reason, the father loves me!

53:30.480 --> 53:32.273
I do know, I do!

53:32.273 --> 53:34.139
(steady heartbeat)

53:34.139 --> 53:36.472
(loud thud)

53:45.297 --> 53:50.297
(eerie instrumental music)
(the Being roars)

54:02.420 --> 54:05.560
- Get a grip man, you must
have just fallen asleep.

54:05.560 --> 54:08.070
- I did not fall asleep.

54:08.070 --> 54:12.010
That thing is here to
judge us, you hear me?

54:12.010 --> 54:14.319
It's here to judge us all.

54:14.319 --> 54:15.769
- You better come downstairs.

54:17.678 --> 54:21.261
(eerie instrumental music)

54:23.530 --> 54:24.543
- I saw it.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.507
I saw it all!

54:27.950 --> 54:29.570
- What did you see, Tanya?

54:29.570 --> 54:32.493
- Somebody wanna tell me what
the hell's going on here?

54:34.820 --> 54:37.070
What the fuck.

54:37.070 --> 54:38.170
-  Alan's gone.

54:39.250 --> 54:42.010
- What do you mean he's
gone, he's right there.

54:42.010 --> 54:43.063
- He's dead Carl.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.253
Your brother's dead.

54:46.253 --> 54:47.643
- Oh my god, it can't be.

54:48.950 --> 54:49.783
- Dead?

54:51.080 --> 54:54.010
- And he wouldn't be if you'd
just let us get him help.

54:54.010 --> 54:57.450
- No Joseph, it's not his fault,

54:57.450 --> 54:59.520
it's not anybody's fault,
it was an accident!

54:59.520 --> 55:01.790
- Like hell, it's his fault.

55:01.790 --> 55:03.240
- You shut the hell up!

55:03.240 --> 55:04.810
- Stop it, both of you.

55:04.810 --> 55:07.610
- You've got no idea what's
going on right now, do you?

55:07.610 --> 55:08.820
- And you do?

55:08.820 --> 55:09.713
- Oh I know.

55:10.700 --> 55:13.263
The apocalypse has come, Joseph.

55:13.263 --> 55:14.623
The end of the world.

55:16.890 --> 55:18.380
I'm actually glad Alan's gone.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.600
I'm happy he's been spared

55:20.600 --> 55:21.613
the tribulation that's on the way!

55:21.613 --> 55:25.070
- The end of the world,
tribulation, apocalypse,

55:25.070 --> 55:26.330
listen to yourself.

55:26.330 --> 55:29.110
- Every death is the end of one world.

55:29.110 --> 55:33.310
A small world, but it's
always a small world,

55:33.310 --> 55:34.307
after all (laughs).

55:36.390 --> 55:37.900
- You shut up, bitch.

55:37.900 --> 55:39.260
This is your fault.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.980
- The fault is yours, Carl Campbell.

55:41.980 --> 55:44.583
You're the one that wanted to go hunting.

55:44.583 --> 55:45.980
- I said shut up!

55:45.980 --> 55:48.333
- Sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.

55:49.830 --> 55:51.540
Your little world ends tonight.

55:51.540 --> 55:52.790
- That's enough out of you.

55:52.790 --> 55:54.483
- Carl, Carl!

55:55.340 --> 55:56.730
This is a bad idea.

55:56.730 --> 55:58.040
- You got a better one?

55:58.040 --> 56:00.610
You wanna leave this possessed
bitch in here with us?

56:00.610 --> 56:03.260
- No, it's just, we let
the law take care of her,

56:03.260 --> 56:04.833
we let Ray take care of her!

56:08.210 --> 56:09.043
- Fine.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.380
She can take her chances outside.

56:13.380 --> 56:15.450
- Don't be afraid Carl Campbell.

56:15.450 --> 56:17.203
Soon you will see as I see.

56:18.260 --> 56:20.150
Soon you will see everything.

56:21.360 --> 56:24.520
(loud thud)

56:24.520 --> 56:27.520
(crickets chirping)

56:33.459 --> 56:37.650
- Dale, we need to get
Alan's body outside.

56:37.650 --> 56:38.920
- Outside, why?

56:38.920 --> 56:40.750
- We need to make it
look like an accident.

56:40.750 --> 56:41.960
- It was an accident.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.033
- We can't rely on Ray for everything.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.120
- He's our brother!

56:46.120 --> 56:47.980
We're not gonna put his body outside

56:47.980 --> 56:49.250
like some sack of garbage!

56:49.250 --> 56:51.710
- Our brother is in a better world,

56:51.710 --> 56:54.320
and that is just a
reminder that we aren't.

56:54.320 --> 56:55.330
- Carl.

56:55.330 --> 56:56.930
- Listen up.

56:56.930 --> 56:58.840
I for one and am not gonna survive

56:58.840 --> 57:00.680
the end of days just to wind up

57:00.680 --> 57:03.000
in a prison cell as an
accomplice to murder.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.130
- That thing is outside!

57:04.130 --> 57:05.923
- That thing is everywhere.

57:09.670 --> 57:10.503
Forget it.

57:11.980 --> 57:12.873
We'll bury him.

57:14.910 --> 57:16.384
Grab a shovel.

57:16.384 --> 57:18.672
No, not you.

57:18.672 --> 57:20.155
You.

57:20.155 --> 57:21.170
- Me?

57:21.170 --> 57:22.533
- I'm gonna need some help.

57:28.110 --> 57:31.027
- So he just left you there, alone.

57:35.340 --> 57:36.840
- You aren't paying attention.

57:38.150 --> 57:39.460
I wasn't alone.

57:39.460 --> 57:41.853
We are never alone.

57:46.290 --> 57:48.703
- No, we aren't alone, are we?

57:52.120 --> 57:54.553
Now why don't you tell us
who was there with you.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.539
- Grace, I need you to distract Dale.

58:05.539 --> 58:07.147
- Joseph, I can't.

58:07.147 --> 58:08.920
- Just long enough for
me to get to the barn.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.267
- I said I can't.

58:10.267 --> 58:12.670
- You heard Carl.

58:12.670 --> 58:14.320
You think he's gonna let us live?

58:15.849 --> 58:18.110
- I can't Joseph, Dale is my husband.

58:18.110 --> 58:19.460
- It's not my fault.

58:19.460 --> 58:20.893
- Yes it is.

58:25.610 --> 58:27.270
I thought you were dead.

58:30.147 --> 58:31.073
- I'm sorry.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.603
You don't know how sorry I am.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.850
- If you want me to help
you, I need to trust you.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.023
You need to tell me everything.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.333
Everything, Joseph.

58:50.756 --> 58:53.420
You know what it is, don't you?

58:53.420 --> 58:55.850
You were talking to it, I saw you.

58:55.850 --> 58:57.630
You told it you wanted
it to take you back,

58:57.630 --> 58:58.870
you said you understood it.

58:58.870 --> 59:00.853
Back, back where?

59:01.950 --> 59:02.783
Where?

59:06.260 --> 59:07.593
No more secrets.

59:15.147 --> 59:16.864
- When I went away...

59:18.505 --> 59:21.171
It wasn't to a place.

59:23.380 --> 59:25.033
Not like we understand it.

59:26.170 --> 59:30.186
It was more of a, a not-place, or a...

59:31.319 --> 59:32.510
...a no place.

59:32.510 --> 59:34.870
- You're not making sense.

59:34.870 --> 59:37.229
- The truth doesn't make any sense.

59:40.460 --> 59:43.743
Six years ago, I was in the barn.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.493
I was standing there, it was, it was dark.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.883
I felt like nothing, like
nothing I did mattered,

59:53.800 --> 59:56.293
and I wanted out of here so bad.

59:57.790 --> 1:00:00.400
And that's when it came.
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:01.233
- It.

1:00:01.233 --> 1:00:02.848
You mean like what's out there?

1:00:04.577 --> 1:00:05.640
- And it told me--

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:07.473
- It spoke to you?

1:00:09.230 --> 1:00:10.293
- Not in words.

1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:15.871
Not even in thoughts exactly, in....

1:00:15.871 --> 1:00:20.437
...in... in being.

1:00:22.897 --> 1:00:25.337
- Being?

1:00:25.337 --> 1:00:27.733
- And I knew it had heard me.

1:00:30.030 --> 1:00:35.030
It had heard my heart, and
it could take me some place

1:00:35.180 --> 1:00:36.413
where I would matter.

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:38.600
- Where is that place?

1:00:40.890 --> 1:00:44.265
- Here, three days ago.

1:00:47.788 --> 1:00:49.614
- How is that possible?

1:00:49.614 --> 1:00:51.880
- That's just a fraction of it, Grace.

1:00:53.110 --> 1:00:55.363
When I was away, when
I was in the no-place,

1:00:57.780 --> 1:01:00.030
I knew everything.

1:01:00.030 --> 1:01:02.573
I knew everyone, I knew every-when.

1:01:04.370 --> 1:01:08.410
I was... just like it was.

1:01:08.410 --> 1:01:10.123
- What is it, Joseph?

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:13.220
Is it really a demon?

1:01:14.330 --> 1:01:18.593
- Carl thinks it's a demon,
but it's beyond that.

1:01:19.570 --> 1:01:21.430
Beyond our labels.

1:01:21.430 --> 1:01:24.993
It's not bound by space
and time, not like we are.

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:27.865
And I think hidden,

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:34.249
those like it are around us all the time,

1:01:34.249 --> 1:01:35.623
we just can't see them.

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.246
- Like angels?

1:01:40.630 --> 1:01:45.335
- No, angels, demons, they're beyond that.

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:49.940
- They're beyond, you
mean there's more of them?

1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:55.400
- Dale's dad told me
something when I was younger.

1:01:57.710 --> 1:02:01.743
He asked me, how many waves
are there on the ocean?

1:02:04.310 --> 1:02:06.850
And I said too many to count.

1:02:08.319 --> 1:02:09.569
You know what he told me?

1:02:11.550 --> 1:02:13.900
- It doesn't matter, all
that counts is the ocean.

1:02:16.660 --> 1:02:17.810
- He told you that too.

1:02:20.121 --> 1:02:21.507
And that's what it's like.

1:02:22.413 --> 1:02:24.618
It's like a wave on an ocean.

1:02:27.071 --> 1:02:29.321
Just one that we can't see.

1:02:30.751 --> 1:02:33.084
- And it brought you home.

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:39.333
Okay.

1:02:40.369 --> 1:02:42.190
I'll take care of Dale, just--

1:02:42.190 --> 1:02:44.607
(door opens)

1:02:49.070 --> 1:02:50.270
- I heard what you said.

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:56.860
And I remember now the
last time I saw you,

1:02:56.860 --> 1:03:01.443
when you went away, and the
power went out that time too.

1:03:04.990 --> 1:03:07.696
Let's go, we're getting
the hell out of here.

1:03:07.696 --> 1:03:08.767
(gun cocks)

1:03:08.767 --> 1:03:11.767
(crickets chirping)

1:03:40.368 --> 1:03:42.035
I think we're clear.

1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:49.683
- Shit.

1:03:51.770 --> 1:03:52.603
- What's wrong?

1:03:54.452 --> 1:03:55.404
- It's dead.

1:03:58.882 --> 1:04:00.449
I made sure of it.

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:08.483
Dale, put that shotgun
down, nice and slow.

1:04:17.770 --> 1:04:19.320
Over there where I can see you.

1:04:22.290 --> 1:04:24.620
I was expecting you Joseph, hell,

1:04:24.620 --> 1:04:26.680
I was looking forward to it, but you?

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.200
What can I say?

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:29.743
You always were the weak one.

1:04:31.147 --> 1:04:32.573
Now get on your knees.

1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:39.480
- Carl, you don't understand.

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:41.200
- I understand plenty.

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:42.660
- Carl, where's Dennis?

1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:45.450
- I said I understand plenty!

1:04:45.450 --> 1:04:47.863
Like, you know what day this is?

1:04:49.627 --> 1:04:50.673
It's Judgment Day.

1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:54.440
Not like I thought it was, not the way

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:56.963
Dad always said it would be, no.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.570
This is a personal kind of Judgment Day.

1:05:00.570 --> 1:05:01.670
- Carl, what did you do?

1:05:01.670 --> 1:05:04.503
- That's what that thing
is bringing us, judgment.

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.783
We all face judgment,
and we all do it alone.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:12.533
Like your brother did.

1:05:14.350 --> 1:05:15.440
- Carl, where's my brother?

1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:19.000
- I told him, I told you all!

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.350
We stay together, we'll be fine.

1:05:21.350 --> 1:05:24.493
But Dennis, he had to try and run.

1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:27.230
He betrayed us.

1:05:27.230 --> 1:05:28.063
-  Carl you can't--

1:05:28.063 --> 1:05:31.400
- He faced his judgment,
and he came up wanting.

1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:34.033
I will not stand for betrayal.

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.083
Not from you, Joseph.

1:05:39.650 --> 1:05:41.280
Not even from my own blood.

1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:42.320
- Carl wait.

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:44.283
- Prepare to be judged.

1:05:46.363 --> 1:05:48.690
(clang)

1:05:48.690 --> 1:05:50.433
- Not today, motherfucker.

1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:53.120
Let's go before he wakes up.

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:55.373
I said let's go!

1:05:58.278 --> 1:06:01.528
(otherworldly humming)

1:06:14.188 --> 1:06:15.021
Joseph.

1:06:20.925 --> 1:06:24.925
(mesmerizing alternative music)

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:44.523
Joseph, no.

1:06:47.158 --> 1:06:49.600
It didn't bring you back
to take you away again.

1:06:51.322 --> 1:06:53.739
To take you to some no-place.

1:07:06.393 --> 1:07:07.473
Then take me too!

1:07:09.130 --> 1:07:10.390
- What?

1:07:10.390 --> 1:07:11.247
- Take me too!

1:07:19.397 --> 1:07:20.230
- Gracie.

1:07:23.698 --> 1:07:24.531
Gracie!

1:07:27.317 --> 1:07:28.150
Grace.

1:07:30.297 --> 1:07:31.130
Grace!

1:07:37.967 --> 1:07:38.800
Grace!

1:07:40.175 --> 1:07:43.865
(otherworldly humming)

1:07:43.865 --> 1:07:45.225
You send that thing back to hell!

1:07:45.225 --> 1:07:46.627
(gun shot)

1:07:46.627 --> 1:07:50.460
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:08:03.847 --> 1:08:06.597
(birds chirping)

1:08:30.015 --> 1:08:30.848
- Joseph?

1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:42.873
Dale?

1:08:45.427 --> 1:08:47.173
What are you doing here?

1:08:49.100 --> 1:08:50.483
- What am I doing here?

1:08:51.436 --> 1:08:53.193
- I haven't seen you in so long.

1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:01.065
- Grace, the baby.

1:09:01.065 --> 1:09:02.953
- Baby, what baby?

1:09:05.236 --> 1:09:06.723
You aren't making any sense.

1:09:13.896 --> 1:09:16.200
- Why, why are we here?
- It's okay.

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:20.763
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.403
- Where's Carl?

1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:29.763
Joseph, where's my brother?

1:09:33.620 --> 1:09:34.453
- Nowhere.

1:09:41.792 --> 1:09:45.375
(mellow alternative music)

1:10:05.250 --> 1:10:06.123
She's sleeping.

1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:11.120
I got through to your brother Ray.

1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:14.147
They'll be here soon.

1:10:15.927 --> 1:10:18.427
(Dale crying)

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:21.053
- She doesn't remember anything.

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:26.323
About me, about us.

1:10:31.448 --> 1:10:33.198
How is that possible?

1:10:34.670 --> 1:10:39.653
- I think, I think it's a kind of mercy.

1:10:43.410 --> 1:10:44.243
- And the baby?

1:10:46.394 --> 1:10:47.227
- That too.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:52.020
I think that's what it does.

1:10:52.020 --> 1:10:55.263
It doles out mercy, in its way.

1:10:58.705 --> 1:11:00.255
- That's a funny kind of mercy.

1:11:01.230 --> 1:11:03.600
- Its ways are not our ways.

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:04.853
- You sound like my dad.

1:11:08.670 --> 1:11:09.990
- Maybe he's right.

1:11:09.990 --> 1:11:12.683
- No, no Joseph, that's not enough.

1:11:14.470 --> 1:11:15.383
What about us?

1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:18.253
What about our mercy?

1:11:20.410 --> 1:11:21.243
- Maybe...

1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.090
The mercy isn't for us
to receive this time.

1:11:29.090 --> 1:11:30.233
It's for us to give.

1:11:34.990 --> 1:11:36.543
- That's easy for you to say.

1:11:44.710 --> 1:11:46.510
They're never gonna believe us, huh.

1:11:47.770 --> 1:11:49.570
- It doesn't matter who believes it.

1:11:52.403 --> 1:11:54.248
I'm not even sure I believe it.

1:11:58.425 --> 1:12:00.400
But the truth is beyond belief.

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:18.740
- That's easy for you to say.

1:12:26.990 --> 1:12:28.573
- So that's your story.

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:31.300
That's what you're going with.

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.100
- You said you wanted the truth,

1:12:36.290 --> 1:12:37.373
and this is it.

1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:42.003
- Yeah, it's just a little
hard to swallow, that's all.

1:12:46.810 --> 1:12:48.393
- It's not my fault.

1:12:53.510 --> 1:12:55.920
- We found Dennis Byrne, he's alive.

1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:58.580
We got him in the Medivac to
the hospital in Binghamton.

1:12:58.580 --> 1:12:59.660
- Status?

1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:02.000
- Rough, but he should pull through.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.280
- Okay thanks, notify the local Five-O.

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:06.113
- Got it.

1:13:08.644 --> 1:13:11.311
(phone ringing)

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:16.540
- Tell me you've got good news.

1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:19.956
- Well, I wouldn't call
it good news exactly.

1:13:19.956 --> 1:13:23.250
We found Dennis Bryne, and Alan Campbell,

1:13:23.250 --> 1:13:24.200
what's left of him.

1:13:25.330 --> 1:13:26.180
- Alright thanks.

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.180
Let me know if you get anything else.

1:13:28.180 --> 1:13:29.070
- Copy that.

1:13:29.070 --> 1:13:31.793
- Sir, I think you need to see this.

1:13:33.556 --> 1:13:36.306
(birds chirping)

1:13:42.712 --> 1:13:47.712
- My dear, I believe you've
got one hell of a story for us.

1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:55.107
(panting)

1:14:08.605 --> 1:14:10.427
(whispering)

1:14:10.427 --> 1:14:12.760
- I'll handle the other one.

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:19.800
- You're free to go.

1:14:25.530 --> 1:14:27.160
- Just like that.

1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:28.010
- Just like that.

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:41.653
- What happened?

1:14:43.150 --> 1:14:44.830
- Well, I think you know
the answer to that better

1:14:44.830 --> 1:14:47.580
than we ever will, but we
have the answers we came for.

1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:51.753
- And that's enough?

1:14:53.380 --> 1:14:54.330
- It'll have to be.

1:15:05.300 --> 1:15:06.563
Have a nice life!

1:15:07.740 --> 1:15:11.150
- I grilled them over and over again.

1:15:11.150 --> 1:15:12.083
Grace too.

1:15:13.910 --> 1:15:15.173
Their stories match up.

1:15:16.990 --> 1:15:18.320
But there's not a shred of evidence

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:19.830
to prove or disprove any of it,

1:15:19.830 --> 1:15:23.550
it's all this like,
bullshit about bright lights

1:15:23.550 --> 1:15:27.033
and demons, and I don't
know how to do that.

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:31.170
- Bury it.

1:15:31.170 --> 1:15:34.620
- No Dad, I can't do that.

1:15:34.620 --> 1:15:35.453
- You heard me.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:39.020
The truth will not come out.

1:15:40.497 --> 1:15:41.597
It can never come out.

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:43.563
You understand me?

1:15:51.930 --> 1:15:52.763
You know what?

1:15:55.110 --> 1:15:56.860
They died for what they believe in.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:15:59.763
Be proud of them.

1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:03.453
They've gone to a better place.

1:16:05.070 --> 1:16:06.190
You don't know how to do it,

1:16:06.190 --> 1:16:07.940
you don't know how to do it by now,

1:16:09.260 --> 1:16:13.780
say that they left fucking suicide notes

1:16:13.780 --> 1:16:15.660
and that the devil made 'em do it.

1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:18.783
Say that lightning struck
'em at the same moment.

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:21.183
I don't give a shit.

1:16:23.110 --> 1:16:26.373
But do not question me, do not.

1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:32.143
- And Joseph Byrne, he
just gets to walk away?

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:35.260
- Do it.

1:16:35.260 --> 1:16:37.660
- You think he's gonna
stay quiet with all this?

1:16:40.090 --> 1:16:42.290
- You will and I will, and in time,

1:16:42.290 --> 1:16:46.670
it'll all just go away, just like before.

1:16:57.300 --> 1:16:58.800
- You guys need anything else?

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:02.650
- I think we're good.

1:17:11.150 --> 1:17:13.200
So you believe they're telling the truth?

1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:16.350
- They believe it.

1:17:16.350 --> 1:17:18.050
That's good enough for us for now.

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:20.933
- What about Carl Campbell?

1:17:22.950 --> 1:17:24.690
- He'll turn up or he won't.

1:17:24.690 --> 1:17:26.960
I'm sure the local yokels
will pin the rest on him.

1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:28.060
- Or they won't.

1:17:28.060 --> 1:17:31.023
The saw is family, as they say
in situations such as this.

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:33.650
- Either way, it's not our problem.

1:17:34.970 --> 1:17:37.350
Let the little people deal with it.

1:17:37.350 --> 1:17:39.040
Are you hungry?

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:41.780
- Yeah, yeah, starving,
what you got in mind?

1:17:41.780 --> 1:17:43.410
- Ever heard of the Spiedie?

1:17:43.410 --> 1:17:44.420
- No.

1:17:44.420 --> 1:17:45.930
- It's a local delicacy.

1:17:45.930 --> 1:17:48.107
It's like a shish kebab sandwich.

1:17:48.107 --> 1:17:49.630
They're supposed to be famous for them.

1:17:49.630 --> 1:17:51.677
- Well I'm game, let me call this in.

1:17:54.116 --> 1:17:56.783
(phone ringing)

1:18:01.060 --> 1:18:01.893
- News?

1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:04.670
- We're all done here.

1:18:04.670 --> 1:18:08.180
Nothing concrete, but
we're getting closer.

1:18:08.180 --> 1:18:09.013
It's our bogey.

1:18:11.020 --> 1:18:13.660
- You're certain?

1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:16.470
- Certain as we're gonna
get, Director Hook.

1:18:16.470 --> 1:18:18.750
-  Get more certain.

1:18:18.750 --> 1:18:20.300
- Yes sir.

1:18:20.300 --> 1:18:21.870
We're on it.

1:18:21.870 --> 1:18:23.360
I'll be sure to contain it.

1:18:25.510 --> 1:18:27.238
- See that you do.

1:18:31.220 --> 1:18:32.890
- Everything alright?

1:18:32.890 --> 1:18:34.302
- Yeah good, let's eat.

1:18:34.302 --> 1:18:35.601
-  Let's.

1:18:35.601 --> 1:18:38.934
(tuneful country music)

1:18:50.770 --> 1:18:54.460
- We all have over the last 24 hours or so

1:18:54.460 --> 1:18:59.233
slipped into a coma of
confusion and speculation.

1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:02.670
I've heard some of the
stories going around.

1:19:02.670 --> 1:19:05.363
They go from the divine to the absurd.

1:19:07.070 --> 1:19:10.543
I think this happened, or
I heard that this happened.

1:19:13.665 --> 1:19:17.560
What has actually happened
has been documented

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:22.400
by the proper authorities,
and I give you my word,

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:23.613
every bit of it is true.

1:19:25.030 --> 1:19:28.110
We have slipped into a mode where,

1:19:28.110 --> 1:19:31.920
where isolation and fear are so familiar

1:19:32.830 --> 1:19:35.490
that we've become comfortable with it.

1:19:35.490 --> 1:19:38.533
That fear has become our addiction.

1:19:39.590 --> 1:19:41.673
Make no mistake, the devil has,

1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:46.183
has set foot in this town, on your ground.

1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:49.740
All we need to do is but ask,

1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:53.333
and God will cleanse our
spirits and our minds.

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:57.260
Look to the good book first, always.

1:19:59.903 --> 1:20:01.533
Get the devil in a choke hold.

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:06.297
Remind him, we are here to serve God.

1:20:09.590 --> 1:20:12.633
God's thoughts are not our thoughts.

1:20:15.330 --> 1:20:19.710
Neither is his ways our ways,
as heaven is above the earth,

1:20:19.710 --> 1:20:23.830
so are God's ways higher,
his thoughts are higher

1:20:25.050 --> 1:20:29.220
than our thoughts, yours or mine.
