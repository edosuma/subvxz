A very brave, very
inquisitive starfish

- But what about if a
shark eats his arms?

04:40.149 --> 04:41.455
- Oh, sharks don't
eat starfish arms.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.326
They're too spicy.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.588
They prefer fish fingers.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.244
- But what about if they did?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.376
- Well, if they did,

04:49.419 --> 04:50.942
the thing about starfish is,

04:50.986 --> 04:53.684
the very magical
thing about starfish,

04:53.728 --> 04:55.860
is that if they lose an arm,

04:55.904 --> 04:57.253
both arms, their legs,

04:58.341 --> 04:59.342
they just grow them back again!

in the big water?

05:09.700 --> 05:10.571
- In the lake?

05:10.614 --> 05:13.225
No, it's not salty enough.

05:13.269 --> 05:16.316
- Hmm. But we could put some in.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.448

could put some in.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.232

that is probably

they're gonna cope without you?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.229

They're already asking
when I'm coming back.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.450
- Well.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.844
I mean, you don't have to.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.455
I could always go back to work.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.021
- And why would you do that?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.980
- 'Cause it's my turn.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.025
Support you for a change.

06:14.069 --> 06:14.809
- But then you'd be unhappy.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.419
And so would I.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.467
You're bringing in enough
for the time being.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.338

was doing for my birthday.

for your birthday.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.015

ask her to come over.

Feet, cold.

Cold feet.

diabetes in his family?

14:33.960 --> 14:34.874
- I don't think so.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.703
- [Doctor] Nevertheless, we'll
get you a warming blanket

14:38.747 --> 14:41.881
and see if we can't do
something about those feet.

14:41.924 --> 14:42.707

14:44.884 --> 14:46.276
Why is he turning that color?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.974

take care of that baby.

Your husband's in
very good hands.

spoken to a doctor?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.871
Right. Well, I'm
gonna find someone.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.178

might be food poisoning.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.571
He ate some

with the sausage, Mrs. Ray.

17:46.152 --> 17:51.113
The cold hands and
feet are due to sepsis.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.203
He has multiple organ failure.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.554
We think the origin may
have been a chest infection.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.862
Somehow, the bug has got
into his bloodstream.

18:00.905 --> 18:04.170
and his immune system has
massively over-reacted.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.129
We're talking about something

18:07.173 --> 18:09.523

to be intervention.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.859
We can.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.251
[Tom sighs]

31:02.295 --> 31:03.862
- I just,

31:03.905 --> 31:05.994
I just want Grace back.

31:07.561 --> 31:08.910
- She'll come around.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.697
You're her dad, she loves you.

31:13.741 --> 31:14.960
- I'm so worried.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.006
- Me too.

31:21.967 --> 31:22.924
But we're strong.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.188
We'll find a way.

31:28.669 --> 31:32.281
And we'll have help,
my mum will help.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.413
- And my mum.

31:34.501 --> 31:35.589
- And your mum.

31:47.688 --> 31:52.649
[phone ringing]
[truck rumbling]

31:55.043 --> 31:56.001
[phone ringing]
- [Grace] Yeah.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.045
- Good.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.353
Right.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.746
[baby coos]

32:11.059 --> 32:16.064
[baby cooing]
[phone ringing]

32:24.203 --> 32:25.769
Hello.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.642
- [Tom's Mother] Why don't
you answer your phone?

32:28.685 --> 32:29.948
- Sorry.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.993
I was outside.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.082
- [Tom's Mother] Are you ill?

32:34.126 --> 32:36.606
[chair creaks]

32:36.650 --> 32:38.043
- No, I'm fine.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.219
- [Tom's Mother] Well,
when are you going in?

32:40.262 --> 32:41.829
- Usual time.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.483
- [Tom's Mother] When
you do, talk to the staff

32:43.526 --> 32:45.006
about checking on him regularly.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.574
I was there about an hour

32:47.617 --> 32:48.444
before the nurse came in,

32:48.488 --> 32:49.619
and I didn't see.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.491

33:19.345 --> 33:20.215
[baby crying]

33:20.259 --> 33:22.261
- It's all right, Freddy.

33:25.612 --> 33:28.615
[dashboard beeping]

33:30.356 --> 33:34.099
Shit!

33:34.142 --> 33:39.147
[cars zooming]
[phone ringing]

33:46.850 --> 33:49.070
- [Grace] Can you read
me a story tonight?

33:49.114 --> 33:49.984
- Not tonight, sweetheart.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.638
Mummy's really tired.

33:51.681 --> 33:52.465
- Please?

33:53.640 --> 33:55.511
- No, not tonight, Grace.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.122
I'm really done in.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.993
[sighs] Come on,
eat your dinner.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.082
- I'm not hungry!
[fork clatters]

34:01.126 --> 34:02.649
- Eat your dinner, Grace!

34:09.830 --> 34:12.093
[Nic coughs]

34:15.140 --> 34:18.099
[sighs]

34:18.143 --> 34:18.882
Which one you doing first?

34:18.926 --> 34:19.666
There we go.

34:19.709 --> 34:20.928
- You look exhausted.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.713
Are you getting enough sleep?

34:23.757 --> 34:24.845
- Shouldn't think so.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.414
- I'm really worried about you.

34:28.457 --> 34:31.156
- [sighs] I wish you
wouldn't keep saying that.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.246
- You and the kids are all
I have to be worried about.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.205
- Right, why don't you
go and get some books

34:37.249 --> 34:38.554
and toys to put
in your rucksack?

34:38.598 --> 34:39.381
Okay?

34:41.862 --> 34:44.082
- And you need to spend
more time with her.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.258
- Mum, don't.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.346
- This is the beginning

34:48.173 --> 34:49.522
of the rest of her life.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.089
- I know.

34:51.132 --> 34:51.872
- And yours.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.178
- Mum.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.702
- How are you going
to bring up a baby?

34:55.745 --> 34:58.661
How are you going to live
here in this house if Tom,

35:00.228 --> 35:01.838
when Tom comes back?

35:01.882 --> 35:02.883
- Mum, stop, please.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.103
If you don't, I don't think

35:05.146 --> 35:06.626
I'm gonna be able
to keep it together.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.151
And I have to keep
it together. Okay?

35:12.022 --> 35:12.806
I have to.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.549
[sighs]

35:54.630 --> 35:55.414
Fuck off!

35:57.111 --> 35:59.287
[sobbing]

36:13.997 --> 36:16.391
I can't do this, Tom,

36:16.435 --> 36:17.653
I can't do it!

36:20.352 --> 36:22.005
I can't!

40:42.570 --> 40:44.311
Do you want to show
Daddy your drawing?

40:44.354 --> 40:45.617
- It's not done!

40:45.660 --> 40:46.444
- Oh, okay.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.706
Well, when it is.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.448
Come on, come sit here.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.755
[grunts]

40:57.890 --> 41:00.545
[sighs] There's been a
good response to the run.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.460
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really good.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.287
And the website's doing okay.

41:05.593 --> 41:06.420
- [Tom] Yeah?

41:07.595 --> 41:10.380
- Maybe you could
do something for it.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.214
- Nic.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.607
- Hey, come on, are
you going to eat that?

41:19.651 --> 41:20.695
- Nic.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.612
I need the loo.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.094
- Oh, okay.
- Now.

41:28.137 --> 41:28.921
- Okay.

41:30.096 --> 41:34.883
[Nic grunting]
[stairs creaking]

41:37.103 --> 41:38.234
- Finished!

41:38.278 --> 41:39.888
- Just a minute.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.890
Okay.
- [Grace] Mummy!

41:41.934 --> 41:43.196
- Not right now, Grace.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.763
I'm just helping
Daddy up the stairs.

41:44.806 --> 41:47.635
[table banging]

41:47.679 --> 41:48.941
[Tom groaning]

41:48.984 --> 41:51.160
- [Grace] Freddy, stop it!

41:53.554 --> 41:54.947
Mummy!

41:54.990 --> 41:55.904
[metal clatters]

41:55.948 --> 41:58.559
[Freddy crying]

41:58.603 --> 41:59.604
- Grace?

42:01.257 --> 42:02.041
Grace!

42:09.570 --> 42:11.572
Now that was silly, wasn't it?

42:11.616 --> 42:13.574
I was going to look
at your picture.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.010
I just had to help Daddy.

42:16.229 --> 42:18.927
It's very nice. And very good.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.452
Can I show it to Daddy?

42:22.496 --> 42:23.758
- It's for Daddy.

42:24.759 --> 42:25.543
- Is it?

42:26.848 --> 42:27.632
Thank you.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.156
He'll love that.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.727
You know he loves you
very much, don't you?

42:36.902 --> 42:38.947
And he's still your same Daddy.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.603
Even though he looks a
little bit different.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.910
- But why does he have hooks?

42:46.694 --> 42:49.697
- Well, they're just to help him

42:49.741 --> 42:50.611
for a little while.

42:52.004 --> 42:53.788
Until we can get him some
better hands and arms.

42:55.094 --> 42:56.356
Will you help us do that?

42:58.053 --> 43:00.621
Good girl.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.318
So, again, thank you for coming,

43:02.362 --> 43:04.582
and let's get this
show on the road!

43:10.457 --> 43:11.545
- On your marks.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.415
Get set.

43:12.459 --> 43:13.199
Go!

43:13.242 --> 43:15.636
[crowd cheering]

43:15.680 --> 43:17.290
- [Jean] Yeah! Go Mummy!

43:17.333 --> 43:19.205
- [Grace] Go Mummy!

43:19.248 --> 43:20.815
- [Woman] Brilliant!

43:22.687 --> 43:23.688
Go Fairy!

43:26.995 --> 43:28.431
- He is so slow!

43:30.695 --> 43:33.698
[crowd chattering]

43:33.741 --> 43:35.830
Have we got enough money yet?

43:37.092 --> 43:38.877
- That's what I'm
trying to work out.

43:42.445 --> 43:43.577
Are those the runners?

43:44.709 --> 43:46.145
- How do you draw a cow?

43:47.799 --> 43:48.843
- Well,

43:50.410 --> 43:53.152
you start with a big
circle for the body,

43:54.632 --> 43:56.721
and then you do a smaller
circle for the head

43:57.635 --> 43:59.114
and then you add the horns,

43:59.158 --> 44:00.594
and the tail, and the legs.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.422
- Mine aren't gonna
have any legs.

44:04.685 --> 44:05.643
- Why?

44:05.686 --> 44:07.514
- They're gonna be lying down

44:07.557 --> 44:08.689
watching the runners.

44:09.734 --> 44:10.735
- Oh.

44:11.692 --> 44:12.606
Of course they are.

44:22.268 --> 44:26.707
Honestly, if this had
happened to anybody else,

44:26.751 --> 44:28.578
I'm not sure the old
me would have responded

44:28.622 --> 44:29.710
to this kind of appeal.

44:31.843 --> 44:35.673
Like you, I assumed we
lived in a caring society,

44:36.804 --> 44:39.415
that there are
safeguards in place

44:39.459 --> 44:41.809
to protect the victims of
such life-changing illnesses

44:41.853 --> 44:43.550
from being forced
to beg for help

44:43.593 --> 44:44.943
from their friends and family.

44:47.554 --> 44:48.947
But the truth is, there aren't.

44:51.906 --> 44:55.823
If Tom was a serviceman
injured in the line of duty,

44:56.868 --> 44:58.739
or a rugby match,

44:58.783 --> 45:02.743
or if he was injured in
an industrial accident,

45:02.787 --> 45:05.790
then, yes, there would be
systems, insurance policies,

45:05.833 --> 45:08.227
and organizations
in place to help us.

45:10.403 --> 45:15.016
But Tom did nothing to put
himself, or us, at risk.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.322
He was Mr. Normal.

45:18.019 --> 45:19.891
His illness came out of nowhere.

45:21.849 --> 45:23.808
And there is no legislation

45:23.851 --> 45:26.071
for things that
happen to Mr. Normal.

45:27.507 --> 45:31.250
No safety net to support
him or his family.

45:33.208 --> 45:36.081
Nothing to help us
fight the battles

45:36.124 --> 45:37.517
we are going to have to face

45:37.560 --> 45:41.086
in the next 10, 20, or
even 50 years ahead.

45:43.566 --> 45:44.959
As far as the
state is concerned,

45:45.003 --> 45:49.442
all they have to do is give
him two sticks to stand on

45:49.485 --> 45:51.270
and hooks to do
everything else with,

45:52.837 --> 45:54.969
and their obligations to
us are totally discharged.

45:56.188 --> 45:57.842
[soft poignant music]

45:57.885 --> 45:58.930
So,

46:01.671 --> 46:04.762
if you can help us do a
little bit better than that,

46:06.981 --> 46:10.028
if you can help us to
fund the technology

46:10.071 --> 46:13.509
that will make Tom's life a
better, more bearable one,

46:14.902 --> 46:17.862
help him regain
his self-respect,

46:17.905 --> 46:19.864
and allow him to
make the contribution

46:19.907 --> 46:20.952
that he is capable of,

46:23.519 --> 46:26.261
then not only will
you be more caring

46:26.305 --> 46:27.872
than the society you live in,

46:30.918 --> 46:33.007
but you will have
the undying gratitude

46:34.879 --> 46:35.923
of a small,

46:37.882 --> 46:39.318
but very determined, family.

46:41.450 --> 46:42.234
Thank you.

46:43.844 --> 46:46.760
[crowd applauding]

47:07.520 --> 47:09.914
[Tom sighs]

47:13.874 --> 47:15.180
- Look!

47:15.223 --> 47:16.007
- I know!

47:17.617 --> 47:22.622
Clever, isn't it?
[Freddy babbling]

47:23.753 --> 47:27.757
[mug clinking]
[hands whir faintly]

47:35.200 --> 47:37.028
It's good, isn't it?

47:56.308 --> 48:01.226
[hand whirring]
[liquid splashes]

48:04.446 --> 48:06.753
[laughing]

48:20.462 --> 48:23.030
- I think this is going
to take a bit more work.

48:23.074 --> 48:26.033
[gentle guitar music]

49:02.852 --> 49:06.117
[hand whirring softly]

49:24.396 --> 49:27.094
[keys tapping]

49:36.060 --> 49:41.065
[water lapping]
[birds chirping]

49:50.074 --> 49:52.554
[Tom gasps]

49:52.598 --> 49:53.338
- Sorry.

49:53.381 --> 49:54.904
- It's all right.

49:57.168 --> 49:58.038
I was thinking,

50:01.650 --> 50:03.217
maybe I could take Grace

50:03.261 --> 50:06.177
to playschool tomorrow
instead of your mum.

50:11.878 --> 50:13.662
What? Not a good idea?

50:17.101 --> 50:17.927
- Maybe not yet.

50:19.451 --> 50:21.061
She's got her routines.

50:21.105 --> 50:23.063
She likes going with Mum.

50:23.107 --> 50:26.066
I don't want to unsettle things.

50:26.110 --> 50:27.154
And.

50:30.114 --> 50:31.115
- What?

50:31.158 --> 50:32.681
- The other kids.

50:37.425 --> 50:38.165
- Yeah.

50:40.124 --> 50:41.690
Yeah. No, of course.

50:45.999 --> 50:47.740
It was just a thought.

50:51.483 --> 50:56.444
[pensive music]
[curtain rods clacking]

50:57.228 --> 50:59.360
[Nic sighs]

51:24.255 --> 51:27.214
[trash rattling]

51:28.563 --> 51:31.349
[dishes clinking]

51:48.017 --> 51:50.411
[Nic grunting]

52:00.726 --> 52:03.729
[urine dribbling]

52:03.772 --> 52:04.512
[door knocks]

52:04.556 --> 52:06.166
- [Nic] It's open!

52:07.689 --> 52:08.821
Grace! Gracie.

52:08.864 --> 52:09.952
- Hello.
- [Grace] What?

52:09.996 --> 52:11.258
[door thuds]
- Grace, Nana's here!

52:12.868 --> 52:13.608
- [Jean] There's a good girl.

52:13.652 --> 52:14.522
- Come on, you big lump.

52:14.566 --> 52:15.871
- [Jean] Oh, that one, right.

52:15.915 --> 52:17.264
There, good.

52:17.308 --> 52:18.091
One on two.

52:18.135 --> 52:18.918
- [Nic] Oh dear.

52:20.833 --> 52:21.703
- Hello, love.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.227
Nic, you're drowning in here.

52:25.185 --> 52:26.621
- Here you go.
- [Jean] Come on, Freddy.

52:26.665 --> 52:29.233
[groans] There's a good boy.

52:29.276 --> 52:31.191
Have you talked to him yet?

52:31.235 --> 52:32.061
- Not yet.

52:34.238 --> 52:35.543
- Come on, let's go!

52:36.892 --> 52:37.980
Off we go with Nana.

52:39.112 --> 52:40.026
- Bye!
- [Jean] Bye!

52:40.069 --> 52:41.375
- [Nic] See you later.

52:43.247 --> 52:44.770
- [Jean] Come on, off we go.

52:46.206 --> 52:48.469
[door thuds]

52:51.298 --> 52:52.734
[Nic sighs]

52:52.778 --> 52:55.215
[keys tapping]

53:08.924 --> 53:10.796
- I'll have to give
the car back soon.

53:12.493 --> 53:13.668
Can't keep it forever.

53:16.715 --> 53:18.282
- Don't see why not.

53:19.544 --> 53:21.328
You've done enough for them.

53:21.372 --> 53:22.721
- I can't, Tom.

53:24.288 --> 53:25.680
I don't work there any more.

53:25.724 --> 53:28.161
Besides, we're gonna have
to get something bigger.

53:28.205 --> 53:31.469
- Well, [sighs] well,
what about the fund?

53:31.512 --> 53:34.385
- We can't use it
for living costs.

53:34.428 --> 53:35.212
We could go on holiday with it.

53:35.255 --> 53:38.215
- [scoffs] Joke.

53:42.088 --> 53:45.918
Maybe we should use the
rest of the money to sue.

53:47.659 --> 53:49.313
- I don't know, I still
think that's a big ask.

53:49.356 --> 53:52.533
- Yeah, but if they'd taken
me to the right hospital,

53:52.577 --> 53:57.190
or if we hadn't been
left in A&E for so long.

53:59.279 --> 54:00.237
- We can't afford it.

54:06.460 --> 54:11.465
- No.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.250
- Unless.

54:17.297 --> 54:19.560
Mum suggested we sell this place

54:19.604 --> 54:21.388
and move in with her.

54:21.432 --> 54:23.521
[Tom scoffs]

54:23.564 --> 54:25.305
- Yeah, that's not one
of her better ideas.

54:25.349 --> 54:27.351
- Well, I don't think
it would be so bad.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.919
It's much bigger.

54:30.963 --> 54:33.052
She's just rattling
around it by herself.

54:33.095 --> 54:34.271
- No!
- She'd be a big help to me.

54:34.314 --> 54:35.315
- No!

54:36.621 --> 54:38.318
- Well, it'd save a lot.

54:38.362 --> 54:40.451
- Absolutely not. Not ever.

54:40.494 --> 54:41.539
I don't even,

54:43.323 --> 54:44.977
I don't even want
to talk about it.

54:45.891 --> 54:46.848
Tell her no.

54:49.024 --> 54:52.463
This is our family house, Nic.

54:52.506 --> 54:53.768
I'm not losing it.

54:56.031 --> 54:56.989
We're staying here.

54:58.512 --> 55:00.340
That's final answer.

55:14.311 --> 55:19.316
[hammer banging]
[keys jingling]

55:38.726 --> 55:41.425
[birds cawing]

55:42.426 --> 55:44.819
[gate clunks]

55:47.300 --> 55:49.781
- [Kid] And again.
[ball thumping]

55:49.824 --> 55:50.912
Go on, shoot!

55:53.524 --> 55:54.438
Yeah, back.

55:55.917 --> 55:58.355
[Tom sighs]

56:06.493 --> 56:08.408
[kids laughing]

56:08.452 --> 56:10.062
- Go get them, Fred.

56:11.542 --> 56:12.673
- [Boy] Goal!

56:15.981 --> 56:17.896
- Good boy! Clever boy!

56:19.593 --> 56:21.073
[Freddy crying]

56:21.116 --> 56:22.030
Oh, I know.

56:26.426 --> 56:28.907
[Tom grunting]

56:38.786 --> 56:41.223
[Tom sighs]

56:49.580 --> 56:50.624
You ready?

56:51.538 --> 56:52.583
- Yeah.

56:54.846 --> 56:58.110
[sighs] I hope it's
better than the last time.

56:58.153 --> 57:00.025
- You're in good shape now.

57:00.068 --> 57:01.113
He'll go for it.

57:01.156 --> 57:02.157
- God, I hope so.

57:04.377 --> 57:05.552
[sighs]

57:05.596 --> 57:07.815
I'm so sick of
looking like this.

57:07.859 --> 57:08.642
- He will.

57:10.122 --> 57:12.385
Come on, we don't want
to keep him waiting.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.561
[Tom sighs]

57:19.523 --> 57:21.307
- [Surgeon] Good. Good.

57:22.134 --> 57:22.961
Very good.

57:23.744 --> 57:26.138
- This is the bit I worry about.

57:29.576 --> 57:32.579
It gives me trouble when I eat

57:33.711 --> 57:36.453
or drink. [slurps]

57:36.496 --> 57:38.498
Are you going to
do more work on it?

57:39.760 --> 57:43.111
Give me a properly
functioning mouth?

57:43.155 --> 57:45.766
Maybe one that looks
a little better.

57:48.639 --> 57:50.771
The nose is okay, I can, um,

57:53.557 --> 57:55.472
I can deal with that, but it's,

57:57.865 --> 57:58.997
the rest gets me down.

58:01.652 --> 58:02.870
- I understand.

58:02.914 --> 58:05.090
And I wish I could
be more optimistic.

58:05.133 --> 58:06.961
To be honest, I'm not sure that

58:07.005 --> 58:09.007
there's much more
that I could achieve.

58:09.050 --> 58:10.312
Or that the pain
that I would have to

58:10.356 --> 58:12.489
put you through would
be worth the result.

58:24.762 --> 58:27.199
- Are you saying this is it?

58:28.287 --> 58:29.723
This is how I stay?

58:33.118 --> 58:33.945
It's not,

58:34.728 --> 58:37.644
it's not gonna get any better?

58:37.688 --> 58:38.950
All the dribbling,

58:41.561 --> 58:42.519
the wetness,

58:46.958 --> 58:48.046
the ugliness.

58:50.178 --> 58:51.876
- If you'd like, I could
refer you to a specialist

58:51.919 --> 58:53.007
for a second opinion.

58:54.226 --> 58:56.097
- I thought you
were a specialist!

58:56.141 --> 58:57.534
- I am, but-
- But?

58:58.709 --> 59:01.189
- Not in facial reconstruction.

59:01.233 --> 59:02.060
You are my first.

59:04.366 --> 59:06.586
[Tom scoffs]

59:07.587 --> 59:10.285
[car rattling]

59:33.265 --> 59:35.789
- He did save your life, Tom.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.713
[Tom sighs]

59:50.630 --> 59:53.024
[dog barks]

1:00:02.642 --> 1:00:04.905
[door slams]

1:00:28.799 --> 1:00:31.453
[Tom kissing]

1:01:14.105 --> 1:01:16.629
- Fly away and back again.

1:01:16.673 --> 1:01:19.153
Fly away and back again.

1:01:20.502 --> 1:01:21.678
Do you remember when
we used to do this

1:01:21.721 --> 1:01:22.722
when you were kids?

1:01:24.637 --> 1:01:29.642
- Not really. No. [sniffs]

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:32.210
- Well, we did.

1:01:32.253 --> 1:01:34.908
- Mum, if it's all
the same to you,

1:01:34.952 --> 1:01:37.128
I prefer not to imagine
you and me and Dad

1:01:37.171 --> 1:01:40.000
in some sort of
happy family scene.

1:01:43.090 --> 1:01:44.875
I always wondered
why you married him.

1:01:46.137 --> 1:01:47.921
- Because I was
in love with him.

1:01:49.270 --> 1:01:50.010
- Really?

1:01:52.143 --> 1:01:54.101
Well, none of the
rest of us were.

1:01:54.145 --> 1:01:54.885
- Yes, you were.

1:01:56.495 --> 1:02:00.238
Not now, obviously,
but you were once.

1:02:01.761 --> 1:02:02.936
He was your dad.

1:02:04.938 --> 1:02:06.853
Not a fantastic man,

1:02:06.897 --> 1:02:07.724
but

1:02:09.769 --> 1:02:10.770
he was your dad.

1:02:12.467 --> 1:02:14.731
- I could never understand

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:18.169
why all the other kids
had such great dads,

1:02:20.432 --> 1:02:21.868
and we were stuck with him.

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:25.959
Adam and I, we used to
talk about it for hours,

1:02:27.569 --> 1:02:29.746
wondering if we were
going to grow up

1:02:29.789 --> 1:02:31.791
to be as crap as he was.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:33.750
- You're nothing like
him, either of you.

1:02:34.881 --> 1:02:36.143
You're good fathers,

1:02:36.187 --> 1:02:38.058
and you care about
the people you love.

1:02:52.899 --> 1:02:54.901
- Eat your food up, Gracie.

1:02:54.945 --> 1:02:56.294
- [Grace] I am!

1:02:56.337 --> 1:02:58.252
- [Jean] Yeah, but you're
not eating your meat.

1:02:58.296 --> 1:02:59.993
- [Grace] Yeah.
- You've got to eat your meat.

1:03:00.037 --> 1:03:01.734
It'll make you strong.

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:02.866
Won't it, Mummy?

1:03:02.909 --> 1:03:03.954
- [Nic] Yeah.

1:03:06.304 --> 1:03:09.133
- [Jean] Do you want me to
cut that up for you, Freddy?

1:03:09.176 --> 1:03:10.612
There.

1:03:10.656 --> 1:03:13.050
- Mm.
- Mm. You're doing very well.

1:03:13.093 --> 1:03:13.877
There you are.

1:03:18.969 --> 1:03:20.840
- Mum, can you look
after Freddy tomorrow?

1:03:20.884 --> 1:03:21.841
- [Jean] Yes, of course.

1:03:23.756 --> 1:03:25.932
- Well, I could look after him.

1:03:25.976 --> 1:03:27.499
- It's his toddler swimming.

1:03:30.023 --> 1:03:31.982
- Oh. [sighs]

1:03:37.465 --> 1:03:38.989
Can I have some more?

1:03:45.691 --> 1:03:48.041
[wine burbling]

1:03:48.085 --> 1:03:49.260
[bottle thuds]

1:03:49.303 --> 1:03:52.350
What, are we on
rations or something?

1:03:55.919 --> 1:03:58.530
[wine burbling]

1:04:06.755 --> 1:04:08.540
Your boyfriend called.

1:04:17.288 --> 1:04:19.290
- He wants to know
if I'd be interested

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:20.987
in going back to work with him.

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:24.817
- I'll bet he does.

1:04:27.515 --> 1:04:29.343
- We need the money, Tom.

1:04:29.387 --> 1:04:31.911
[sighs]

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.652
- Well, never mind.

1:04:34.566 --> 1:04:36.046
I've done the lottery this week.

1:04:39.745 --> 1:04:41.616
I've done five lines.

1:04:45.577 --> 1:04:46.317
- Pass the salt.

1:04:53.237 --> 1:04:56.893
This is pepper!
[shaker clatters]

1:04:57.981 --> 1:04:59.983
It doesn't matter. Don't bother.

1:05:00.026 --> 1:05:01.941
It's bad for me anyway.

1:05:04.378 --> 1:05:05.684
Everything's bad for me.

1:05:09.470 --> 1:05:10.254
- [Grace] Can we
go again tomorrow?

1:05:12.517 --> 1:05:14.475
- We've looked so many times.

1:05:15.824 --> 1:05:17.696
Can't we go do something else?

1:05:17.739 --> 1:05:19.219
- Please?

1:05:19.263 --> 1:05:21.004
- No.

1:05:21.047 --> 1:05:24.790
- But what if the salty
sea brings one tonight?

1:05:24.833 --> 1:05:26.835
[sighs]

1:05:29.969 --> 1:05:31.014
- It was a story.

1:05:34.147 --> 1:05:34.931
I made it up.

1:05:36.541 --> 1:05:41.111
You see, the salty sea
can't join up with our lake,

1:05:41.154 --> 1:05:42.939
so the starfish can't get there.

1:05:42.982 --> 1:05:46.116
- But you said all the
water joins up somewhere.

1:05:46.159 --> 1:05:47.813
- Did I? Well, I made it up.

1:05:52.165 --> 1:05:53.384
I shouldn't have done that.

1:05:55.168 --> 1:05:56.778
People shouldn't make things up.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:06:00.043
They should tell
each other the truth.

1:06:00.086 --> 1:06:02.828
- But it might be the truth.

1:06:02.871 --> 1:06:06.005
Grownups don't know everything.

1:06:06.049 --> 1:06:08.051
[chuckles]

1:06:11.228 --> 1:06:12.751
- No, they don't.

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:19.018
Night night.

1:06:19.062 --> 1:06:19.888
- Night night.

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:23.762
It's okay. I'll get
Nana to take me.

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:30.682
[low gentle music]

1:06:30.725 --> 1:06:33.293
[water lapping]

1:06:43.216 --> 1:06:45.958
- [Jean] Good boy, there we go.

1:06:47.133 --> 1:06:48.134
Yes.

1:06:48.178 --> 1:06:49.222
Grace!

1:06:50.267 --> 1:06:52.225
Grace, what are you doing?

1:06:52.269 --> 1:06:53.052
- Nothing!

1:06:54.532 --> 1:06:56.012
- [Jean] All right.

1:07:20.862 --> 1:07:22.255
- [Radio Announcer]
Bad day at all.

1:07:22.299 --> 1:07:25.302
On travel fronts, roads
doing pretty well so far.

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:28.261
Nothing blocked, no accidents
that I know of at the moment.

1:07:28.305 --> 1:07:29.480
Anything you do,

1:07:29.523 --> 1:07:31.047
please do get in touch.
[pills clattering]

1:07:31.090 --> 1:07:32.309
[case snaps]

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:33.875
Oakham, Uppingham, and
the villages coming up.

1:07:33.919 --> 1:07:35.355
Anything that's
going on in your-

1:07:35.399 --> 1:07:36.182
- Tom?

1:07:38.228 --> 1:07:39.098
I've left your pills out,

1:07:39.142 --> 1:07:40.056
don't forget to take them.

1:07:42.188 --> 1:07:44.147
- [sighs] No.

1:07:44.190 --> 1:07:45.017
- [Nic] Promise?

1:07:47.498 --> 1:07:48.281
- No.

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:50.240
- [Nic] Tom?

1:07:50.283 --> 1:07:51.893
- Yes!

1:07:51.937 --> 1:07:53.721
- [Nic] See you later.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:08:00.337
[talk radio chattering]
[Tom slurping]

1:08:11.174 --> 1:08:13.437
[hand slams]

1:08:21.532 --> 1:08:24.100
[bowl scraping]

1:08:29.888 --> 1:08:32.325
[bowl crashes]

1:08:54.086 --> 1:08:56.871
[people chatting]

1:09:05.358 --> 1:09:06.838
[truck rumbling]

1:09:06.881 --> 1:09:07.665
- What?

1:09:22.897 --> 1:09:25.378
[door slams]

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:33.169
[keys clatter]

1:09:48.009 --> 1:09:51.099
[Tom panting softly]

1:09:57.715 --> 1:09:59.847
[grunts]

1:10:01.109 --> 1:10:01.893
Come on!

1:10:22.435 --> 1:10:25.177
[Tom slurping]

1:10:31.139 --> 1:10:33.925
[bottle scraping]

1:10:36.449 --> 1:10:38.886
[hand whirring faintly]

1:10:38.930 --> 1:10:41.454
[wine burbling]

1:10:51.334 --> 1:10:54.250
[wine splatters]

1:11:01.039 --> 1:11:03.737
[glass shatters]

1:11:03.781 --> 1:11:06.262
[hand slams]

1:11:09.787 --> 1:11:12.398
[Nic panting]

1:11:23.888 --> 1:11:25.324
[birds chirping]

1:11:25.368 --> 1:11:28.327
[slow serene music]

1:11:46.954 --> 1:11:47.694
- Hello?

1:11:51.524 --> 1:11:52.482
Tom?

1:11:58.488 --> 1:12:01.360
[door squeaks]

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:04.058
[model clatters]

1:12:14.591 --> 1:12:18.508
- There isn't gonna be
any fucking compensation.

1:12:18.551 --> 1:12:20.945
[model snaps]

1:12:28.648 --> 1:12:31.390
[Tom Voiceover] Dear Dad.

1:12:31.434 --> 1:12:32.609
It's been a long time.

1:12:33.436 --> 1:12:34.915
I hope you're well and busy.

1:12:36.830 --> 1:12:38.397
I've always followed
your career,

1:12:39.616 --> 1:12:41.574
especially when you
were at the National.

1:12:43.184 --> 1:12:44.403
You may not know this,

1:12:44.447 --> 1:12:45.665
but you were a big
influence on us.

1:12:45.709 --> 1:12:48.929
I used to love doing
accents and dialects,

1:12:50.148 --> 1:12:52.411
but my mouth's all
swollen up now,

1:12:52.455 --> 1:12:54.370
and my lips are distorted,

1:12:55.545 --> 1:12:57.155
so the diction's mostly gone.

1:12:59.592 --> 1:13:02.378
I wish things had gone
differently for us.

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:05.424
Where's the sense in life

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:07.295
if we just fill it with silence?

1:13:09.297 --> 1:13:13.127
I woke up one night
and started to die.

1:13:15.565 --> 1:13:16.740
It's made me realize that

1:13:16.783 --> 1:13:19.786
our relationships are
all we leave behind.

1:13:22.485 --> 1:13:24.225
The thing is, Dad, I'm broke.

1:13:25.488 --> 1:13:26.663
I mean really brassic.

1:13:28.708 --> 1:13:30.449
The illness has cleaned us out,

1:13:30.493 --> 1:13:32.190
and it's getting to the point

1:13:32.233 --> 1:13:33.583
where we're going under, so

1:13:35.454 --> 1:13:37.195
I am writing to ask

1:13:37.238 --> 1:13:40.894
if you can help us
out with a small loan,

1:13:42.330 --> 1:13:44.115
help us get through
the next few months

1:13:44.158 --> 1:13:46.334
till I can get back
into some kind of work.

1:13:47.466 --> 1:13:49.599
If you can't spare a few bob,

1:13:49.642 --> 1:13:51.514
perhaps we could
still stay in touch

1:13:52.515 --> 1:13:55.126
and fill some of the silence.

1:14:04.744 --> 1:14:06.964
[sobbing]

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:23.589
[Jean laughing]

1:14:30.944 --> 1:14:34.165
- [Jean] Grace seems
much happier these days.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:37.516
- Just give it a fucking rest.

1:14:38.561 --> 1:14:41.477
- Sorry?
- Why? What are you sorry for?

1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:43.043
You sorry for
sticking your nose in?

1:14:43.087 --> 1:14:43.914
- Tom.

1:14:43.957 --> 1:14:44.741
- What?

1:14:47.613 --> 1:14:49.659
- I worry about what's best.

1:14:49.702 --> 1:14:51.704
- Well, you don't get
to decide what's best.

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:54.402
We do that.

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:57.318
You don't get to make
the decisions. We do.

1:14:57.362 --> 1:15:00.496
I do, I do that because
they're my kids.

1:15:01.584 --> 1:15:04.325
And I'm their father, not you.

1:15:04.369 --> 1:15:05.152
Yes?

1:15:06.414 --> 1:15:08.678
- Well, I'm sorry if you
think I'm interfering-

1:15:08.721 --> 1:15:09.679
- Sorry. Yes, you're sorry.

1:15:09.722 --> 1:15:10.984
You're so sorry.

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:12.769
Sorry that your daughter
ever fucking married me.

1:15:12.812 --> 1:15:13.987
- [Jean] That's not fair!

1:15:14.031 --> 1:15:15.511
- No, it bloody isn't!

1:15:15.554 --> 1:15:18.992
Do you know what
else isn't fair, huh?

1:15:19.036 --> 1:15:20.820
It's not fair that we all have
to live here with each other.

1:15:20.864 --> 1:15:22.909
That was another one
of your great ideas.

1:15:24.128 --> 1:15:25.259
What's fair about that?

1:15:25.303 --> 1:15:26.957
'Cause no one asked me.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.524
Were my feelings
ever considered?

1:15:28.567 --> 1:15:31.048
No! And here we bloody are!

1:15:31.091 --> 1:15:33.180
- I had to do something!

1:15:33.224 --> 1:15:36.227
You were going to
lose the house anyway.

1:15:36.270 --> 1:15:37.445
- Please, stop it! Stop it!

1:15:37.489 --> 1:15:39.491
- You think it's
fair that I got eaten

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.101
by some fucking killer bug?

1:15:41.145 --> 1:15:42.712
- Tom!

1:15:42.755 --> 1:15:44.540
- And I suppose you would
think it would be fairer

1:15:44.583 --> 1:15:46.672
if I hadn't managed to
beat the fucking thing

1:15:46.716 --> 1:15:47.934
and survive.

1:15:47.978 --> 1:15:49.545
Perhaps it would have
been fairer if I'd died,

1:15:49.588 --> 1:15:50.633
- [Jean] Oh!
- to everyone else.

1:15:50.676 --> 1:15:52.373
Is that what you
think? Huh, is it?

1:15:52.417 --> 1:15:53.549
Then you could take
over completely.

1:15:53.592 --> 1:15:55.594
You could run
everything Jean's way!

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:57.553
Well, I'm so sorry to get

1:15:57.596 --> 1:16:01.687
in the fucking way!
[Jean sobbing]

1:16:21.272 --> 1:16:22.055
What!

1:16:33.676 --> 1:16:36.069
[Nic sighs]

1:16:59.658 --> 1:17:00.485
It's not me.

1:17:01.791 --> 1:17:02.618
It's her.

1:17:05.882 --> 1:17:07.753
- She's just trying
to protect me.

1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:10.887
Me and Gracie and Freddy.

1:17:13.846 --> 1:17:14.630
She's done

1:17:16.196 --> 1:17:17.545
everything she can.

1:17:17.589 --> 1:17:20.679
We all do everything we can.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.946
We walk on eggshells around you.

1:17:26.990 --> 1:17:29.209
You only see how this
thing affects you.

1:17:30.776 --> 1:17:33.779
You don't, you won't see how
it's hurting everybody else.

1:17:34.737 --> 1:17:36.739
[Tom scoffs]

1:17:36.782 --> 1:17:37.827
- No, she's,

1:17:38.828 --> 1:17:41.831
she's stealing you
away from me, Nic.

1:17:43.571 --> 1:17:44.572
You and the kids.

1:17:44.616 --> 1:17:45.791
No, actually no,

1:17:47.184 --> 1:17:48.359
it's worse than that.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:50.622
It's like she is
turning me into a kid.

1:17:52.929 --> 1:17:55.409
It's like you and
her, you're the,

1:17:55.453 --> 1:17:56.976
you're the fucking adults,

1:17:57.020 --> 1:17:59.196
and I am just another baby

1:18:00.850 --> 1:18:02.242
to be spoon fed,

1:18:03.156 --> 1:18:04.418
cleaned up after.

1:18:07.465 --> 1:18:08.248
It's like

1:18:09.336 --> 1:18:10.120
I'm losing

1:18:11.687 --> 1:18:15.299
everything, every last bit
of what makes me a man.

1:18:15.342 --> 1:18:16.387
It's disappearing.

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:19.477
And then,

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.133
after I've lost my dignity,

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.265
what do I have left?

1:18:28.355 --> 1:18:29.139
Nothing.

1:18:30.444 --> 1:18:31.707
Nothing, that's it.

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:34.710
I can't work. I
can't make money.

1:18:36.059 --> 1:18:38.714
I can't give you
or Freddy or Grace

1:18:40.628 --> 1:18:41.760
any of the things
that I wanted to.

1:18:41.804 --> 1:18:42.805
All the things,

1:18:46.809 --> 1:18:47.984
all the things I never had.

1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:56.383
I can't,

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:01.084
I can't kiss them goodnight.

1:19:03.303 --> 1:19:04.914
I can't hold their hands.

1:19:08.831 --> 1:19:10.049
I can't even smell them.

1:19:15.838 --> 1:19:17.796
I can't smell you anymore.

1:19:25.064 --> 1:19:26.892
Or make love to you.

1:19:27.850 --> 1:19:30.243
[sniffling]

1:19:31.810 --> 1:19:33.116
- I can't, Tom.

1:19:33.899 --> 1:19:35.683
I can't.

1:19:35.727 --> 1:19:39.078
I can't do that
any more. [crying]

1:19:43.213 --> 1:19:43.996
Look at me.

1:19:46.477 --> 1:19:47.347
I'm a wreck.

1:19:48.958 --> 1:19:50.046
I'm not desirable.

1:19:52.178 --> 1:19:54.050
Do you really want
to make love to me?

1:19:56.052 --> 1:19:57.531
Do you really need
another reminder

1:19:57.575 --> 1:19:58.924
of what it was like before?

1:19:58.968 --> 1:20:00.883
Of what we've lost?
'Cause I don't.

1:20:02.449 --> 1:20:04.016
I just want to get
through the days

1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:09.065
and get us to some sort
of secure place, where if,

1:20:10.936 --> 1:20:12.111
I don't know,

1:20:12.155 --> 1:20:14.418
some sort of normality
that isn't this.

1:20:15.898 --> 1:20:17.813
If we can't ever be truly happy,

1:20:17.856 --> 1:20:20.641
at least we could have some
sort of happiness around us.

1:20:24.950 --> 1:20:28.606
You, Grace and Freddy
are everything to me.

1:20:32.131 --> 1:20:33.872
And I'll never stop
loving you, Tom.

1:20:35.221 --> 1:20:37.267
I'll never stop
believing in you.

1:20:40.487 --> 1:20:41.227
But,

1:20:42.881 --> 1:20:43.795
I can't,

1:20:43.839 --> 1:20:46.058
I can't make love to you.

1:20:46.102 --> 1:20:47.059
I just can't.

1:20:49.018 --> 1:20:50.933
I can't be that girl any more.

1:20:52.935 --> 1:20:54.632
I've seen, I've done things

1:20:54.675 --> 1:20:56.808
that no lover should have to.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:21:00.377
I don't even dream
like I used to.

1:21:00.420 --> 1:21:02.031
I don't dream at all!

1:21:02.074 --> 1:21:03.771
I just plan,

1:21:03.815 --> 1:21:06.905
and I try and get
through the days.

1:21:06.949 --> 1:21:10.909
And you make that so
very difficult, Tom.

1:21:10.953 --> 1:21:12.389
With your,

1:21:12.432 --> 1:21:13.999
with your black moods,

1:21:15.218 --> 1:21:17.698
and the way you hate
everybody and everything!

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:26.011
God knows you have
a right to be angry,

1:21:27.665 --> 1:21:29.275
but we are not your enemy.

1:21:30.624 --> 1:21:33.105
Not me, not Gracie, not Freddy,

1:21:33.149 --> 1:21:34.280
not my mum.

1:21:35.151 --> 1:21:38.241
We're the ones who love you.

1:21:38.284 --> 1:21:41.940
We're the ones who go
through that pain with you.

1:21:41.984 --> 1:21:42.680
Every inch.

1:21:42.723 --> 1:21:44.856
Every second! Every day!

1:21:46.118 --> 1:21:48.642
And all we get
back is more hurt,

1:21:48.686 --> 1:21:50.949
more anger, more pain.

1:21:53.821 --> 1:21:54.953
God, it's getting like we can't

1:21:54.997 --> 1:21:56.650
even breathe when you're around.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:57.434
You just,

1:21:59.001 --> 1:22:02.700
you just suck all the air
out of every room you're in!

1:22:16.061 --> 1:22:17.193
- Don't leave me, Nic.

1:22:23.155 --> 1:22:25.984
Please.

1:22:26.028 --> 1:22:28.030
Please don't leave me.

1:22:33.818 --> 1:22:35.298
- Don't you get it?

1:22:36.952 --> 1:22:38.344
We're not leaving you.

1:22:40.607 --> 1:22:42.000
It's the other way around.

1:22:45.569 --> 1:22:47.571
[sighs]

1:22:57.015 --> 1:23:02.107
[clock ticking faintly]
[quiet solemn music]

1:23:54.333 --> 1:23:59.338
[birds chirping]
[water lapping]

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.099
- [Boy 1] Pass!

1:25:04.142 --> 1:25:09.104
[ball thumping]
[kids laughing]

1:25:11.062 --> 1:25:12.281
Oh, I'm gonna shoot.

1:25:12.324 --> 1:25:13.282
- [Joey] Here!

1:25:14.892 --> 1:25:16.372
- [Boy 1] Yeah, here.

1:25:16.415 --> 1:25:17.416
- [Joey] Yeah.

1:25:17.460 --> 1:25:19.157
- [Boy 1] Here we go.

1:25:22.639 --> 1:25:24.423
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah!
[ball thuds]
