00:33.301 --> 00:35.369
* What did you expect *

00:35.436 --> 00:38.172
* Fools often sometimes forget *

00:38.239 --> 00:40.541
* Who really knows
what's the truth *

00:40.608 --> 00:44.745
* Often dignify,
often changin' the tide *

00:44.812 --> 00:47.815
* It feels like
you already knew *

00:47.881 --> 00:52.386
* Like the devil,
you would never run in circles *

00:52.453 --> 00:54.888
* Just like
you've already known *

00:54.955 --> 00:59.160
* Like the devil, you would
never run in circles *

00:59.227 --> 01:00.761
* Just like
you've already known... *

01:00.828 --> 01:03.164
( barking )

01:03.231 --> 01:05.599
Over here!

01:14.208 --> 01:15.876
How many?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.711
Three, all female.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.780
Appear to be Latino.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.515
No IDs yet, by the way.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
They're pretty
tangled up.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.252
We don't want
to touch them

01:24.318 --> 01:26.420
till the forensics
team gets here.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.690
They've been cut open, gutted.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.793
And from the blood
evidence it looks like...

01:32.860 --> 01:35.896
it happened up here and then
they were dumped down there?

01:35.963 --> 01:37.097
Yeah. We're going to be talking

01:37.165 --> 01:39.300
about some pretty
disturbed individuals.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.202
Some kind of
cult, maybe.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.837
Satanic stuff is usually
seen in teenagers.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.474
Not exactly on a college
track, I'm guessing.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.609
What else is around here?

01:48.676 --> 01:49.777
Nothing.

01:49.843 --> 01:50.711
Government land goes down

01:50.778 --> 01:52.446
to about where you
turned off the road.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.748
After that, it's all farm
fields, agriculture.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.117
It's a pretty good chance
all three were illegals.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.187
Excuse me.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.121
I'm Megan Reeves of the FBI.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.056
What was your team
doing out here?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.358
Who tipped you off?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.059
Some guy called it in.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.895
What was he doing out here?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.697
He wasn't. He's a psychic.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.932
Mapped out the location
in sketches.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.201
Psychic?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.835
Guy right over
there talking

02:14.902 --> 02:15.869
with the sheriff.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.371
He drew this.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.112
Wonder if he's
psychic enough to know

02:25.179 --> 02:27.681
he just made the suspect list.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.133
You can't really believe

02:46.200 --> 02:48.135
I had something
to do with these murders.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.838
Wow, he really is
psychic, Don.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.840
You just read my mind.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.678
You have no understanding
at all of what it is I do.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.347
Do you?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.014
DON:
These are pretty detailed.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.416
You've been
there before?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.521
Not in the way
you're suggesting.

03:07.588 --> 03:11.859
Not in my, uh, physical body.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.793
MEGAN:
Excuse me?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.564
I have the power
to project my conscious mind.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.599
Oh... This is where
we lay in the grounds

03:18.666 --> 03:20.268
for the insanity
plea, right?

03:20.334 --> 03:23.103
I have a gift, Agent Reeves.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.307
I see things.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.642
Visions. They come to me,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.878
like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.647
And once I put enough
of the pieces together

03:33.714 --> 03:36.484
to draw these images,
I called the sheriff.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.853
Who clearly believed you
enough to send a search team

03:39.920 --> 03:40.688
on a five-mile hike.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.524
I've worked with him before.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.426
A missing child case
two years ago.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.495
Were you a suspect in
that case as well?

03:47.561 --> 03:50.598
The missing boy's family
brought me in,

03:50.664 --> 03:53.033
and thanks
to the gift I have,

03:53.100 --> 03:53.901
he was found.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.569
Alive and unharmed.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.206
I might be able
to help here as well.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.207
Oh, yeah?

04:00.274 --> 04:02.276
Okay. What have you got?

04:02.343 --> 04:06.246
Nothing yet,
but once the channel is open

04:06.314 --> 04:07.548
more visions may come.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
Yeah? What do you want?

04:09.049 --> 04:10.584
An acknowledgement

04:10.651 --> 04:12.453
from the Bureau for my work.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.488
That's it?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.957
They're about to publish
my new book.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.258
( chuckles )

04:18.326 --> 04:19.293
Pass.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.160
Why?

04:20.227 --> 04:21.995
W... You're a suspect

04:22.062 --> 04:23.230
in a triple homicide.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.565
We're not here

04:24.632 --> 04:26.367
to promote your book.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.968
It's a good way

04:28.035 --> 04:29.002
to sell books, though, huh?

04:29.069 --> 04:29.870
Commit a crime and then

04:29.937 --> 04:32.406
show up to mystically
help solve it?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.975
That is ridiculous.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.277
Well, you shouldn't leave town,
and we're gonna

04:37.345 --> 04:38.512
need your passport.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.981
Otherwise, you're free to go.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.353
Your father always wanted a son.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.455
Didn't he?

04:47.521 --> 04:49.623
What are you talking about?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.924
You were the youngest?

04:54.362 --> 04:55.563
Three older sisters?

04:55.629 --> 04:56.930
You were

04:56.997 --> 04:59.967
his last chance.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.606
I don't appreciate people
looking into my personal life.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.008
I told you, it's not
something I control.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.710
Well, if I were you,
I'd learn how to.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.279
There's somebody else.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.348
Something...

05:16.016 --> 05:17.184
...no one else knows

05:17.250 --> 05:18.552
about you.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.121
I understand. Just let me know
as soon as you find out.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.155
All right?
Thanks. Hey.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.491
So what do you think?

05:23.557 --> 05:24.525
He knew about the murders.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.093
He has to be involved somehow.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.495
Well, maybe.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.830
Don. This psychic stuff.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.832
You cannot take
it seriously, okay?

05:31.899 --> 05:32.866
Charlie, can you

05:32.933 --> 05:34.468
prove to me
there's nothing to it?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.769
There is no
scientific evidence

05:35.836 --> 05:37.971
for the existence of
psychic ability, okay?

05:38.038 --> 05:38.806
None whatsoever.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.940
-Yeah?
-It's make-believe.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.475
No, I don't know
about that, actually.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.644
I saw a guy randomly
take someone from a group,

05:43.711 --> 05:45.879
come up with stuff about
the guy's life the person said

05:45.946 --> 05:47.981
that nobody would ever
know about them, so...

05:48.048 --> 05:48.782
It's an act, man.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.050
They're guessing, okay?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.219
They, they... Look. It's just
like blindly throwing darts.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.621
Throw enough darts,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.456
you're gonna eventually
hit a bull's-eye.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.857
-Yeah, but...
-So look,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.926
that guy, he probably
has such a deep desire

05:58.992 --> 06:00.528
to believe that he
dismisses the misses

06:00.594 --> 06:01.895
and focuses on the hits.

06:01.962 --> 06:02.930
It's called optimistic bias.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.665
Charlie, this guy isn't
just throwing darts.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.233
I can tell you that right now.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.568
Just, there's plenty

06:07.635 --> 06:09.369
of simple, more
rational explanations

06:09.437 --> 06:10.404
to be considered.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.406
We've got all
of his information.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.141
I'll have the agent
that drops him off

06:14.207 --> 06:14.942
confiscate his passport.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.510
I thought you
were dropping him off.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.680
I just got something
I need to check out.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.716
DAVID:
How we doing on our victims?

06:22.783 --> 06:23.517
Any IDs yet?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.886
No. All three are Jane Does.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.088
The only thing we know
is they're all Latinas,

06:28.155 --> 06:31.692
late teens to early 20s.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.860
Jane Doe number one

06:32.926 --> 06:34.595
had a receipt
in her pocket

06:34.662 --> 06:36.797
puts her in Tecate,
Mexico, three days ago,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.899
so she only
just got to the States.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.168
If they're illegals, it's
gonna be tough to ID them.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.536
Prints won't be
in our system,

06:42.603 --> 06:44.071
Immigration
won't have them.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.573
The fact is, we
don't even know

06:45.639 --> 06:46.940
what country they
started out from.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.341
Get anything from

06:48.408 --> 06:49.577
the coroner's reports yet?

06:49.643 --> 06:52.312
Here's the preliminary
from the crime scene.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.081
All three cut open,

06:54.147 --> 06:55.816
belly to chest.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.552
No indication of skill,
surgical knowledge.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.820
Still waiting on the autopsy
report, though.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.721
I do have some

07:00.788 --> 07:02.856
information on the occult stuff
found at the scene.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.324
Satanic stuff?

07:04.391 --> 07:06.259
Turns out it's
not Satanic.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.796
The statues are related to
something called Semana Santa.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.263
It's popular
in Central America.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.264
It's a blend

07:11.331 --> 07:14.067
of modern religions and some
old, indigenous rituals.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.903
So these are what,
religious killings?

07:15.969 --> 07:16.737
Sacrifices?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.272
Maybe some kind of exorcism.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.574
I don't know.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.348
These girls were young.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.918
Border Patrol says they've
been seeing a growing stream

07:30.984 --> 07:33.587
of young women
coming over on their own.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.824
They dream of a better job,
a better life.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.560
They sure as hell didn't
dream of ending up like that.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.071
( sighs )

07:52.472 --> 07:53.774
Something wrong?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.308
Sorry.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.010
I didn't mean
to stare at you.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.647
You were there, watching
the questioning, weren't you?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.816
I'm not impressed. I'm sorry.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.851
Right.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
You could have
easily seen me there.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.457
You don't believe at
all in what I do.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.625
Do you?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.794
Honestly, no.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.996
And that's not to say
that you don't believe

08:16.063 --> 08:16.830
what you do.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.666
I'm sure there are
a lot of so-called

08:18.732 --> 08:20.534
psychics that are
absolutely convinced

08:20.601 --> 08:22.703
that they have an ability.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.538
But you're convinced
they don't

08:24.605 --> 08:27.541
because... it's not logical.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.942
Because you haven't seen proof.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.043
That's right.

08:32.112 --> 08:38.285
So you wouldn't be impressed
if I said I felt the presence

08:38.351 --> 08:42.022
of your mother...

08:42.089 --> 08:43.190
standing beside you.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.461
Okay, now you've stepped
into the category of con man.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.930
Why is that?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.432
The fact that you know me,
that you know about my mother

08:52.499 --> 08:53.701
means nothing.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.302
I do a lot
of consulting here,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.536
and that's no secret.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.438
The fact that my mother is
deceased is no secret.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.641
It only proves

09:00.708 --> 09:01.842
you did a little
research. Great.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.644
But now you're trying to pass
that off as something else?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.679
Well, that doesn't
make you delusional.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.816
That makes you... deceitful,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.284
and that,
and that I don't like.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.753
( elevator bell rings )

09:14.855 --> 09:16.189
I'll get the next one.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.875
Nice tire imprint you got.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.277
Rained here less
than a week ago,

09:37.344 --> 09:38.478
so it's got to be recent.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.748
Ah, it could belong
to our killer.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.816
No sedan would make it up here.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.951
Whatever left that print

09:44.017 --> 09:45.585
had to be
a four-wheel drive.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.720
Right.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.321
Fortson Trail-Hawk.
All-terrain.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.456
Light truck or SUV.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.725
Whatever it is must have had
some miles on it.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.893
That tread's pretty worn.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.696
Manual said they stopped
production in '99.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.897
Well, we're probably
looking at something

09:56.964 --> 09:58.866
late '90s or early 2000s.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.333
Let's get the word out.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.702
Right.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.905
Listen, the FBI has used
psychics before,

10:04.972 --> 10:06.940
as have other
law enforcement agencies,

10:07.007 --> 10:08.608
whether they admit
to it or not.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.777
Thank you for destroying

10:09.843 --> 10:11.311
any confidence I had
in public safety.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.514
What is your criteria
for this categorical dismissal

10:14.581 --> 10:16.149
of parapsychological phenomena?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.450
Reality.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.618
Oh, yes, reality.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.153
What would that be?
Newtonian reality?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.322
Einsteinian reality?
Quantum reality?

10:22.389 --> 10:23.456
This is for the two of us.

10:23.523 --> 10:27.194
Larry, you cannot go about
defending this as science.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.697
Listen, two University
of Chicago studies

10:29.763 --> 10:33.901
have presented evidence that the
human brain is still evolving.

10:33.967 --> 10:38.806
Two key brain-building
genes are undergoing rapid

10:38.872 --> 10:42.175
mutations, so what if unique
perceptual abilities

10:42.242 --> 10:45.345
arose just as a simple
genetic variant?

10:45.412 --> 10:46.246
Larry, first of all,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
I'm well aware of those
studies, okay?

10:48.448 --> 10:49.750
I might very well

10:49.817 --> 10:51.084
incorporate some of that data

10:51.151 --> 10:52.786
into my cognitive
emergence work.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.722
But you're suggesting
that this guy Kraft

10:54.788 --> 10:56.790
is somehow higher evolved
than the rest of us.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.927
What if the human brain
has reached a point

10:59.993 --> 11:02.195
where it is sensitive
on a subatomic level--

11:02.262 --> 11:05.332
a level where matter
can appear and disappear,

11:05.398 --> 11:07.701
where time can run
backwards or forwards?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.870
I mean, who is to
say what's possible,

11:09.937 --> 11:11.071
what isn't possible?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.874
What flavor of crazy Kool-Aid
do they make you drink

11:13.941 --> 11:16.209
when you join
the Physics Department?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.886
DAVID:
Agent Cullen.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.020
Agent Sinclair, Granger.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.056
-Thanks for meeting us.
-Hey, not a problem.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.357
I'm out here anyway.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.125
We're hoping because
you patrol the area

11:32.192 --> 11:34.061
you might be able
to help us out.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.462
We heard about
those girls.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.964
Obviously, anything we can do.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.598
We were wondering
if maybe you've come across

11:38.665 --> 11:41.201
-any of these before.
-Far as we can tell, they have

11:41.268 --> 11:42.936
-Central American origin.
-Well, lots of these

11:43.003 --> 11:45.438
migrant workers,
they bring across prayer cards,

11:45.505 --> 11:47.074
candles, stuff like that, but...

11:47.140 --> 11:49.242
I don't think I've
ever seen this before.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.077
You think

11:50.143 --> 11:51.111
it's related to the murder?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.746
These girls were cut open.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.015
These artifacts
were scattered around them.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.885
Sounds to me like somebody's
trying to send a message.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.987
Message-- what do you mean?
Like, for who?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.955
-Coyotes.
-I take it you don't mean

12:02.022 --> 12:03.490
-the furry little animals.
-No.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.493
Smugglers who shuttle
these people up from Mexico.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.962
No pun intended,
but it's a cutthroat business.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.697
-I'll bet.
-A lot of money,

12:10.764 --> 12:11.731
a lot of competition.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.033
Choose the wrong trail guide,

12:13.100 --> 12:14.868
maybe that's
what happens to you.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.040
Think Cullen could be right
about the killer being a coyote?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.409
They'd certainly be capable
of that violence, but...

12:22.475 --> 12:25.212
why the whole setup with the
candles and the statues?

12:25.278 --> 12:29.249
I guess like he said,
to send a message.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.053
What's up?

12:34.654 --> 12:37.657
Early '90s pickup.

12:37.724 --> 12:42.195
Let's see if we can get a closer
look at those tire treads.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.808
Hey, buddy, you know
whose truck that is?

12:59.146 --> 12:59.612
Hey!

12:59.679 --> 13:01.148
FBI!

13:01.214 --> 13:02.782
Whoa! FBI!

13:02.850 --> 13:03.550
Stop!

13:03.616 --> 13:05.385
Do not start that car!

13:05.452 --> 13:06.753
Don't even start it!

13:06.820 --> 13:07.720
-Don't move!
-Okay!

13:07.787 --> 13:08.822
I'm not going
anywhere.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.223
Yeah, you're damn right
you're not.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.192
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.564
( groans )

13:18.832 --> 13:20.333
( groans )

13:20.400 --> 13:21.902
Trail-Hawks.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.170
Tires are a match.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.072
That's not good for you.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.977
Colby.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.888
Borrego.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.222
Paperwork checks out.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.424
That's right--
I'm in this country legally,

13:44.491 --> 13:45.926
-which means I have rights.
-You do.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.828
And of them is the right
to lethal injection.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.163
What are you talking about?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.875
Oh, my God.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.215
What, you-you think I did this?

14:09.782 --> 14:10.884
Are you kidding me?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.153
No. I got a whole nother
kidding face.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.488
DAVID: We found tire tracks
that match your truck

14:15.555 --> 14:18.058
about 30 yards from where
these girls were butchered.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.826
I work out there.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.029
I drive all over those hills
every day.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.396
Doing what exactly?

14:23.463 --> 14:25.665
My group, Border Care...

14:25.732 --> 14:27.567
we help undocumented workers.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.069
You help them how?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.438
I set up water stations,
and when it's cold

14:31.504 --> 14:33.974
I take them blankets
and clothing.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.876
Last summer,
68 people died of exposure,

14:36.944 --> 14:39.312
trying to find a better life.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.584
What about these statues?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.520
Like the ones we found
in your truck.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.022
I found them.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.824
Near the migrant camp
where you saw me.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.226
They're bad luck totems.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.729
I figured somebody was trying
to scare off the workers.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.198
So why'd you run
when you saw us?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.000
I thought you were someone else.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.168
Someone like who?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.335
Private border patrol.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.670
These anti-immigration
vigilantes.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.008
They've been harassing these
poor workers for months now.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.877
They sure as hell don't like
what I do.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.446
-Samuel Kraft was in the CIA.
-What?

15:13.513 --> 15:14.747
As an operative?

15:14.814 --> 15:17.150
As a psychic-- they had
a program called Stargate,

15:17.217 --> 15:18.986
where they took people
like Kraft

15:19.052 --> 15:21.288
and tried to train them
to use them as weapons

15:21.354 --> 15:24.024
-to spy on enemies, to kill
people. -Yeah. It wasn't him.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.458
'Kay, I got
the coroner's report.

15:25.525 --> 15:29.029
-Jane Doe number one dead 48 to
56 hours ago. -Which puts him

15:29.096 --> 15:30.263
-still in Seattle.
-Yeah.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.564
I mean, it's a legit alibi.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.865
COLBY: Borrego's story
checks out.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.534
This guy runs
a human rights group.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.037
He's a, uh, advocate
for the illegals.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.771
But he did point
the finger at this

15:38.838 --> 15:40.173
private Citizens Border Guard.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.341
Yeah, he says
they've been

15:41.408 --> 15:43.110
harassing these workers
for the last few weeks.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.444
And the coyotes,
what about them?

15:44.511 --> 15:45.845
It didn't mesh,
the whole occult thing.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.248
I mean, if you're killing
these girls to send a message,

15:48.315 --> 15:49.282
why pretend it's something else?

15:49.349 --> 15:50.817
Yeah, but you could
say the same thing

15:50.883 --> 15:52.719
about the Citizens Border Guard.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.587
Except Borregos said the totems
we found, the statues,

15:54.654 --> 15:56.589
they're supposed to be
some kind of bad luck,

15:56.656 --> 15:57.490
like they're a curse.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.192
It's a good way
to scare off

15:59.259 --> 16:00.460
other immigrants
from making the trip.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.928
You know, play on
their superstitions.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.363
They can't close
the border,

16:03.430 --> 16:04.897
but they can
definitely stop them

16:04.964 --> 16:06.033
from wanting to cross it, right?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.668
-That's cheating. -Hey, you're
not allowed to do that.

16:11.738 --> 16:12.839
Hey, guys.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.742
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.411
Ooh! I don't want to interrupt
your victory.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.747
Well, that would imply we're
actually doing something.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.914
( laughs )

16:21.981 --> 16:22.949
What's going on?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.951
I wanted to see
if you knew anything

16:25.018 --> 16:26.253
about the CIA's
Stargate program.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.088
I thought maybe with
your NSA clearance,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.690
you might have seen
something somewhere.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.159
Sure. Stargate.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.527
Ludicrous waste
of taxpayer money.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.529
No, no, no, don't be so quick
to vilify here.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.864
I've done
a little research myself,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.532
and I think that it had
some merit.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.933
Okay? The CIA recruited

16:41.000 --> 16:42.169
individuals who
demonstrated

16:42.235 --> 16:43.670
psychic ability.

16:43.736 --> 16:44.904
Don't.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.039
They trained them
in something

16:46.106 --> 16:48.341
called remote viewing-- and
with some success, I might add.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.676
President Carter recounts
a time when,

16:49.742 --> 16:51.511
I think it was a State
Department plane

16:51.578 --> 16:53.613
went down
in a Central African jungle.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.747
A California psychic

16:54.814 --> 16:59.386
intuited the exact latitude
and longitude of the crash site,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.121
led the search team
right to it.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.855
CHARLIE:
These yahoos also removed

17:02.922 --> 17:04.124
the vocal cords
from goats,

17:04.191 --> 17:06.526
stared at the goats for hours on
end in an attempt

17:06.593 --> 17:09.229
to try to kill them
with their thoughts.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.963
Samuel Kraft was
a part of Stargate.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.365
CHARLIE:
Megan...

17:12.432 --> 17:15.968
this good man here is obviously
too far gone to be saved,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.171
but please tell me that you're
not buying

17:18.238 --> 17:20.039
Kraft's story as well.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.075
He said some things to me.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.910
What kind of things?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.312
He just, uh,

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
-knew things about me.
-You know what?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.648
He tried that with me,
and all it means

17:28.715 --> 17:31.318
is that he spent an hour or two
Googling you.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.320
You know,
these were just...

17:33.386 --> 17:36.489
things that
you can't look up anywhere.

17:38.891 --> 17:45.098
I, um... I haven't talked
to my father in ten years.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.135
-Okay, why is that?
-Well, you know...

17:48.201 --> 17:50.203
he just had
some expectations for me

17:50.270 --> 17:51.904
that I wasn't ever gonna meet.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.340
But...

17:53.406 --> 17:55.375
how does Kraft know that?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.009
Because... I must admit,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.712
he's really good
at what he does.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.348
See, he throws out
a few vague statements,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.616
but remember, it's your
willingness to believe him

18:03.683 --> 18:05.518
that fills in
those blanks.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.053
Now, there's an
unscientific assumption.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.321
A supportable theory,
at least.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.090
Supported by what, by
your own pronouncements?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.759
Then are you ready, Fleinhardt?

18:12.825 --> 18:14.194
Ready to put your...

18:14.261 --> 18:15.962
black magic to the test?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.764
LARRY:
Eppesie,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.166
I was born ready.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.544
Evening.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.247
Good evening.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.982
Saw your headlights--
I was expecting

18:36.048 --> 18:37.984
-someone else.
-Other members

18:38.050 --> 18:39.619
of the Citizens Border Guard.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.223
So, what brings the FBI out?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.591
Your group's Web site lists you

18:44.657 --> 18:46.226
as the head of the
local chapter.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.495
Yep. It was my time
to do my part,

18:48.561 --> 18:51.198
seeing that the problem is
literally in my own backyard.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.799
What problem would
that be exactly?

18:52.865 --> 18:55.502
Illegal immigration.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.504
We got seven million
undocumented aliens

18:57.570 --> 18:59.372
drawing on the system--
how long do you think

18:59.439 --> 19:00.873
the economy can support that?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.041
So let me get this straight--

19:02.108 --> 19:02.975
you and your buddies,
you drive around

19:03.042 --> 19:05.144
in these hills, round 'em up
and send 'em back home?

19:05.212 --> 19:07.079
-Is that right?
-You're the FBI.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.548
You should be just as worried.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.717
What, you don't think the
terrorists can just walk

19:10.783 --> 19:12.719
across the border just
like the rest of them?

19:12.785 --> 19:13.553
Tell you what.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.388
Let us worry
about the terrorists.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.723
Right now we want
to talk

19:16.789 --> 19:18.858
about three young girls
who were murdered.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.127
Oh, I heard about that.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.396
-That's pretty frightening.
-Well, that certainly

19:23.463 --> 19:25.365
doesn't hurt your cause any,
now, does it?

19:25.432 --> 19:27.066
Might even slow
the flow of illegals

19:27.133 --> 19:28.535
across the border
for a while.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.804
You think we had something to do
with it? There's no way.

19:31.871 --> 19:32.772
Then you wouldn't mind
if we took a look

19:32.839 --> 19:33.873
at your membership roster,
then, huh?

19:33.940 --> 19:34.841
You better believe I'd mind.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.108
Mr. Winnard...

19:36.175 --> 19:37.310
we're gonna find this killer,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.812
and it's gonna hurt your cause
in a big way

19:39.879 --> 19:42.482
if it turns out to be
one of your guys.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.484
-I know my men.
-Do you?

19:44.551 --> 19:45.852
Well enough to risk everything?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.555
That there's not one loose
cannon in there whose motives

19:48.621 --> 19:50.423
might not be
quite as pure as your own?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.825
Let us do some
quiet checking, okay?

19:52.892 --> 19:53.860
If we're wrong,

19:53.926 --> 19:56.896
no harm done, no one has
to know we were here.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.467
I feel a bit like
a prized show dog

20:00.533 --> 20:03.069
and you're asking me
to go fetch a stick.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.572
Well, before we know
we can trust you,

20:05.638 --> 20:07.206
we're gonna need
verification.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.843
You said in your book this
card trick was child's play.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.247
I'm just surprised
you still have doubts.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.618
You can start.
We're ready.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.825
Black.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.763
Black.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.866
Red.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.804
Black.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.274
Black.

20:42.809 --> 20:43.976
Red.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.813
Red.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.550
That's enough. You can stop.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.721
How'd I do?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.928
He failed.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.363
You see that? How bad?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.765
25 cards--
He got them all wrong.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.468
All of them?

21:09.336 --> 21:10.403
Well, the odds

21:10.470 --> 21:11.638
of getting them all wrong

21:11.704 --> 21:13.640
are the same as getting them
all right.

21:13.706 --> 21:17.310
-Must be...
-One in 33.5 million.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.513
That man is playing with us.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.917
KRAFT:
Black.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.721
Black.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.323
There.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.892
There's a reflection here.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.662
I think. I'm gonna call Amita
and get her to run

21:35.728 --> 21:37.196
-a digital enhancement.
-Charles, you know,

21:37.263 --> 21:38.665
while I cannot discount
out of hand

21:38.731 --> 21:40.367
that there might be fraud
involved here...

21:40.433 --> 21:41.934
He cheated, Larry.
He's a cheater.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.169
But what concerns me here

21:43.235 --> 21:45.372
is your intransigence

21:45.438 --> 21:49.275
to the contemplation
of any other possibility.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.612
No one's ever proven
psychic ability. Ever.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.348
It required the creation and
launch of the Hubble Telescope

21:55.415 --> 21:59.752
in order to see protoplanetary
disks form in the Orion Nebula.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.188
Now, does that mean that
they simply weren't there

22:02.254 --> 22:03.690
for the thousands of years

22:03.756 --> 22:05.291
when we lacked the instruments
to see them?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.293
So ESP exists

22:07.360 --> 22:08.961
because we can't find it?

22:09.028 --> 22:12.264
We observe the universe
through the limited prism

22:12.331 --> 22:14.033
of our senses.
Now, I acknowledge

22:14.100 --> 22:15.535
the possibility--

22:15.602 --> 22:18.871
the likelihood-- that
there are realities

22:18.938 --> 22:21.140
that lie beyond the
realm of our senses.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.843
That sounds like blind faith,
not science.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.978
Well, to misquote
Shakespeare here,

22:26.045 --> 22:27.747
"There are more things
in Heaven and Earth

22:27.814 --> 22:30.182
than are dreamt of in
all your mathematics."

22:30.249 --> 22:32.051
Shakespeare also had people
sprouting donkey ears,

22:32.118 --> 22:33.720
and wood fairies
running through his forests.

22:33.786 --> 22:37.524
I'm not here to debate belief
systems, just methodology.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.926
To hold to one assumption,

22:39.992 --> 22:42.962
and exclude any and all
contradictory data--

22:43.029 --> 22:44.330
that isn't science.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.998
That's politics.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.802
Just finished running
background checks

22:49.869 --> 22:52.539
on our buddies over at the
Citizens Border Guard.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.806
And nobody pops?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.608
Pretty much
all family guys,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.009
local business owners.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.845
I was really hoping to
find that lone nutjob,

22:58.911 --> 23:00.747
but there's just
nothing on this roster.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.348
So we don't have
an obvious suspect.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.150
We don't have any suspect.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.718
We can't I.D. the victims.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.655
We have no more information now
than when we started.

23:08.721 --> 23:12.224
Okay, well,
what about the psychic?

23:12.291 --> 23:13.760
He has an alibi.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.695
I didn't mean as a suspect.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.830
I'm talking about going
to him for help

23:17.897 --> 23:19.098
maybe.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.768
Thank you.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.537
-What do you got there?
-Coroner's report

23:24.604 --> 23:25.872
on the other two victims.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.440
It's practically
a carbon copy

23:27.507 --> 23:30.477
of Jane Doe number one.
Female Latinas,

23:30.543 --> 23:31.978
late teens,
early 20s,

23:32.044 --> 23:34.080
unskilled lacerations.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.248
Wait a minute.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.684
What?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.452
The times of death
are different.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.253
What do you mean?

23:41.320 --> 23:42.388
How far apart are you talking?

23:42.455 --> 23:43.456
Jane Doe number two

23:43.523 --> 23:45.391
was killed a full day

23:45.458 --> 23:47.560
before Jane Doe number one.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.361
And number three was
killed as much as two days

23:49.428 --> 23:50.396
before that.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.598
So the murders

23:51.664 --> 23:52.832
weren't a one-time event.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.035
Which means there could be
a lot more bodies out there.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.003
And more bodies to come.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.678
I agree with you.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.781
There are more
women in danger.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.584
So you've had more
of your visions?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.419
Well, let me show you.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.188
All right. Well,
what do they all mean?

24:16.255 --> 24:18.324
I don't know yet.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.760
The visions are
still hazy.

24:20.827 --> 24:25.097
But I definitely
see another woman.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.365
Maybe more than one.

24:26.432 --> 24:27.399
In the visions,

24:27.466 --> 24:28.635
are they alive?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.436
They're in motion.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.905
Traveling.

24:32.972 --> 24:33.973
And...

24:35.307 --> 24:37.777
There's something
else. They're...

24:39.111 --> 24:42.414
I want to say
they're... they're...

24:42.481 --> 24:44.884
pregnant.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.318
Pregnant.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.453
I had the
same sense

24:47.520 --> 24:49.121
with the first
three victims.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.558
Well, the autopsies say
you're wrong about that.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.092
These are impressions.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.728
They're like dreams.
They have to be interpreted.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.064
Why don't you gather
up your things

24:58.130 --> 24:59.398
and come down
to the office

24:59.465 --> 25:01.200
with us?

25:01.267 --> 25:03.135
What about my request?

25:03.202 --> 25:04.070
You really think

25:04.136 --> 25:05.805
this is the time
to be negotiating?

25:05.872 --> 25:08.675
I can't imagine
a better one.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.826
Why is he back?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.394
Because we're worried
there could be

25:28.460 --> 25:29.528
more murders coming.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.563
Based on his
predictions?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.131
Predictions that dovetail
with evidence.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.400
I can't believe you're treating
him as a credible source.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.869
You said what happened with
those cards was impossible.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.805
That's exactly what I'm here
to talk to you about.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.840
I can't, Charlie. I can't ignore
any more help.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.042
Don made the decision
to go with Kraft.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.311
I'm just doing
what he says.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.886
Thank you.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.356
You're not here to
sharpen pencils, are you?

25:57.423 --> 26:00.559
No. The card game.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.129
You got them all wrong

26:03.195 --> 26:05.698
when you could have
got them all right. Why?

26:05.765 --> 26:08.500
The test was your idea,
wasn't it?

26:08.567 --> 26:09.902
I figured
you'd be the one

26:09.969 --> 26:11.003
to interpret the results.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.805
Trying to impress me again?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.642
I thought
you were feeling left out,

26:15.708 --> 26:18.144
not being part of the case.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.546
I know how you cheated.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.049
I didn't cheat.

26:23.115 --> 26:23.716
You did.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.087
Your glasses.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.691
You kept fidgeting with them.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.092
Must be a nervous habit.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.393
Actually,
that's what

26:34.460 --> 26:35.928
I thought at first,
as well.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.029
And then...

26:37.930 --> 26:39.531
I enhanced the video.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.333
Turns out

26:41.400 --> 26:43.469
your nervous habit

26:43.535 --> 26:45.437
is actually
a tricky little way

26:45.504 --> 26:47.640
of gathering
a reflection of the cards

26:47.707 --> 26:49.308
off the glass right here.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.146
It's amazing

26:54.213 --> 26:57.616
what wonders
real science can achieve.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.021
Let me ask you a question...

27:02.689 --> 27:05.191
Professor Eppes.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.761
If you have it in your power
to save lives,

27:08.828 --> 27:10.462
does anything else

27:10.529 --> 27:12.765
really matter?

27:14.033 --> 27:16.102
These are the latest
from Kraft.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.870
He still thinks
there's one or more

27:17.937 --> 27:19.806
potential victims traveling.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.240
But do we have any idea

27:21.307 --> 27:24.844
what the "15"
or the "S" and the "B" mean?

27:24.911 --> 27:28.781
Traveling. It's got
to be bus or car, right?

27:28.848 --> 27:32.384
And 15 is a major route
coming up from Southern Mexico.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.721
You might be right
on the whole bus thing.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.789
There are two major
bus carriers in Mexico

27:36.856 --> 27:40.159
with the letters "S"
and "B" in their names--

27:40.226 --> 27:42.729
Baja del Sur
and Sierra Bonita.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.096
They're both
wide carriers

27:44.163 --> 27:45.564
with routes to at least
ten border towns.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.665
COLBY:
The problem is,

27:46.733 --> 27:47.967
even if we know
precisely which bus,

27:48.034 --> 27:49.135
we still don't know

27:49.201 --> 27:51.103
-who we're looking for.
-We need more information

27:51.170 --> 27:53.272
on the original victims--
the Jane Does.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.106
They're the key.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.241
I mean,
they'll tell us,

27:55.307 --> 27:56.876
if we can figure
out who they are,

27:56.943 --> 27:59.846
who the killer is, why he's
looking for them...

27:59.912 --> 28:00.980
Maybe we can
get the psychic

28:01.047 --> 28:02.381
to refocus
on the victims.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.350
CHARLIE: How about you
try using math

28:04.416 --> 28:06.052
instead of magic?

28:07.086 --> 28:08.955
All right, Charlie.
What do you got?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.589
What if I could
help locate

28:10.656 --> 28:11.924
the other immigrants
that crossed

28:11.991 --> 28:13.459
the border with the victims?

28:13.525 --> 28:14.393
Can you?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.996
Very possible, using
the Fokker-Planck equation.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.331
Now, it allows us
to determine the movements

28:19.398 --> 28:21.633
of something under the influence
of external forces--

28:21.700 --> 28:23.069
like a herd of animals.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.404
A whole host of forces
act on the herd

28:25.471 --> 28:26.773
to determine its movement.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.341
Some forces attract the herd--

28:29.408 --> 28:31.477
forces like a watering hole,
a food source,

28:31.543 --> 28:32.745
a safe resting place.

28:32.812 --> 28:36.715
Other forces deter the herd--
predators, obviously.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.084
Hostile terrain.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.519
Now, these forces
can be analyzed

28:40.586 --> 28:42.588
to determine the distance
and direction

28:42.654 --> 28:43.722
that the herd will travel.

28:43.790 --> 28:44.891
Can you apply this

28:44.957 --> 28:45.925
to the migrant workers?

28:45.992 --> 28:49.161
This equation can apply

28:49.228 --> 28:51.130
to any nomadic
population.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.065
But, instead of
considering forces

28:53.132 --> 28:54.166
like a watering hole,

28:54.233 --> 28:55.768
we're considering
farm jobs,

28:55.835 --> 28:57.837
safe encampments,

28:57.904 --> 28:59.705
transportation routes.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.407
Okay. And,
instead of predators,

29:01.473 --> 29:04.811
it would be the Border Patrol
and the Citizens Border Guard.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.946
Right. Now, we know

29:07.013 --> 29:08.781
Jane Doe number one
crossed the border

29:08.848 --> 29:10.449
from Tecate
three days ago.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.417
That gives us a starting point.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.352
Now, if others crossed over
with her,

29:13.419 --> 29:15.788
the Fokker-Planck equation
is a model that can

29:15.855 --> 29:17.957
predict where
the others are now.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.125
All right. Good, Charlie.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.526
So why don't you get on that?
And, meanwhile,

29:20.592 --> 29:21.794
we keep working with Kraft.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.095
We'll run the bus angle

29:23.162 --> 29:25.164
and anything else
the guy comes up with. Right?

29:34.206 --> 29:36.876
Hey, Charlie, in all your
rearranging in here,

29:36.943 --> 29:38.144
did you ever come
across a box

29:38.210 --> 29:40.913
labeled "Population
Density Studies"?

29:40.980 --> 29:43.415
I need it for
my mall project.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.351
Char...

29:45.417 --> 29:46.752
Charlie.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.821
Sorry. I'm just not sure

29:48.888 --> 29:50.522
how well these equations
will translate

29:50.589 --> 29:51.824
into human populations.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.026
Aw. You know what?

29:54.093 --> 29:56.495
They've better
than random sketches, right?

29:56.562 --> 29:58.097
Right?

30:00.766 --> 30:02.501
Oh, not you now.

30:02.568 --> 30:03.702
Was I asleep?

30:03.769 --> 30:05.471
Did I miss the memo?

30:05.537 --> 30:06.906
When did the whole world

30:06.973 --> 30:09.241
throw rational thought
out the window?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.177
Charlie, it's notabout what I
believe or don't believe.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.112
I just think it's
very comforting

30:13.179 --> 30:15.081
for people to know that
everything that we know

30:15.147 --> 30:16.782
isn't all
that there is.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.517
I'm not saying
we know everything, Dad.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.921
Science is all about attacking
the mysteries of the universe--

30:21.988 --> 30:23.422
unmasking the unknown

30:23.489 --> 30:25.191
in a rational,
methodical manner.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.825
I know. But the world
is not always

30:26.893 --> 30:28.127
a rational,
methodical place.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.661
You're good at a lot
of things, Charlie,

30:29.728 --> 30:31.797
but accepting that fact
is not one of them.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.065
Hey, perfect timing.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.400
Let's all sit down
at a Ouija board

30:34.466 --> 30:36.768
and try to solve "P" v. "NP"
once and for all.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.237
Don't start with me,
you know?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.439
I mean, the FBI has used
psychics, and they've helped.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.941
So, even if the guy's
throwing darts,

30:42.008 --> 30:45.978
I'd be happy with a dumb-luck
bull's-eye right about now.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.114
Believe me, Don,
it's a waste of your time.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.448
Yeah, well,
I've heard that before.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.449
More than once.
I mean,

30:50.516 --> 30:52.018
when all we had
was one of your theories,

30:52.084 --> 30:54.153
believe me, I heard that.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.421
Please, show me enough respect

30:55.487 --> 30:58.157
not to put my work
on the same level as your swami.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.358
All right, boys,
that's it.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.792
Let's take a step back
for a minute.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.362
I'm going to go one better,
and step all the way off.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.430
You can let your psychic solve
it for you.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.165
-Come on.
-Charlie, where you going?

31:06.232 --> 31:07.366
Charlie!

31:16.542 --> 31:19.979
Water. I get a very strong
sense of water.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.948
Water will be important somehow.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.049
Okay, what water?

31:23.115 --> 31:24.416
You mean, like,
a river? An ocean?

31:24.483 --> 31:25.817
I don't...
I don't know yet.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.619
I can just tell you
I sense water.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.088
But there's just...
there's not enough detail.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.090
We can't pinpoint
an accurate location

31:31.157 --> 31:33.192
with... without more detail.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.760
I'm sorry. I'm telling
you everything I can.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.095
It's just not there yet.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.565
I... Maybe... maybe after.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.732
What do you mean, after?

31:40.799 --> 31:46.172
With the others, the visions
became much clearer after...

31:47.639 --> 31:50.242
the girls were dead.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.112
I think
I have something.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.983
Unless you're
already solved it.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.584
Don told us

31:58.650 --> 31:59.518
you were off the case.

31:59.585 --> 32:03.122
If I have it in my power
to save lives,

32:03.189 --> 32:05.357
then... then everything else
doesn't matter.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.028
These areas here...
Different herds

32:09.095 --> 32:09.895
behave in
different manners.

32:09.962 --> 32:12.031
Since we don't know how many
people crossed the border

32:12.098 --> 32:14.233
with Jane Doe number one,
I ran the algorithm

32:14.300 --> 32:15.968
with three different
group sizes--

32:16.035 --> 32:17.069
five to ten, ten to 20,

32:17.136 --> 32:18.270
20 to 30.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.405
And these are the results.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.841
There is a 68% chance
that someone

32:22.908 --> 32:24.076
who crossed
the border

32:24.143 --> 32:25.677
with Jane Doe number one
can be found

32:25.744 --> 32:27.913
in one of these three areas.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.616
( speaking Spanish )

32:30.682 --> 32:32.018
Gracias.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.653
Hola. Buenos dias.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.623
Senorita, Вїcomo esta?

32:37.689 --> 32:40.292
ВїConoce a estas mujeres?

32:40.359 --> 32:42.428
ВїLes a visto antes?

32:45.197 --> 32:48.067
Hola. ВїHa visto
estas mujeres?

32:48.134 --> 32:50.136
Have you seen her?
Or her?

32:50.202 --> 32:53.172
Gracias.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.408
Any luck?

32:56.475 --> 32:57.209
No.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.078
They all seem to be scared.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.213
The question is,
are they afraid of us

33:01.280 --> 33:05.084
or whoever did this
to these girls?

33:05.151 --> 33:08.087
All right, keep asking.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.989
Perdoname, senor.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.059
Buenas dias.
Como esta?

33:13.125 --> 33:16.262
Conoce a estas mujeres?

33:18.930 --> 33:20.932
La ha visto antes?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.601
No.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.736
W-Wait a minute.
You recognize her.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.573
Senor, senor, un momento.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.708
La ha visto antes?

33:29.775 --> 33:31.843
Necesito su ayuda.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.713
Por favor, quien es ella?

33:36.748 --> 33:39.618
Mire, yo no quiero
ningun problema.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.986
No, no, no.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.221
Pero si, la he visto.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.855
-Si? -Estaba en la frontera
con Tecate.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.957
Okay.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.694
Esperabanos juntos,
que se hiciera noche.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.229
Su nombre es Alba.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.435
He recognized
Jane Doe number one.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.903
He said they were
in Tecate together.

33:57.969 --> 34:01.073
Waited for it to get dark
before they crossed the border.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.741
Does he know her name?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.243
Just her first name--
Alba.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.312
He said that she said
she was

34:06.378 --> 34:08.447
from a small town
in El Salvador called Metapan.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.182
If we can get her photo
and her prints

34:10.249 --> 34:11.450
to the police down there...

34:11.517 --> 34:13.485
It's a small city,
someone might recognize her.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.754
Yeah. He also said
she said something else

34:15.821 --> 34:17.989
that was really strange, and
that is that she wasn't looking

34:18.056 --> 34:19.325
for work over here.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.826
She was just coming to the
States for a few days

34:20.892 --> 34:23.262
and then going right back.

34:23.329 --> 34:26.132
We contacted the police
in Metapan, El Salvador.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.400
Sent them photos and prints
of all three victims.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.802
Oh, yeah-- they ID'd
all three, huh?

34:30.869 --> 34:31.803
Families reported
them missing.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.540
Suspected runaways.
Here's where it gets weird:

34:34.606 --> 34:36.242
Aside from the same town
of origin,

34:36.308 --> 34:37.276
there's nothing to indicate

34:37.343 --> 34:38.544
that these girls knew
each other at all.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.678
What, you mean,
they're not friends?

34:39.745 --> 34:40.812
They're not
traveling together?

34:40.879 --> 34:42.714
-No. -Somehow they end up
in the hands

34:42.781 --> 34:44.483
of the same killer
in California.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.186
Now, how's a killer pick his
victims 2,500 miles away?

34:47.253 --> 34:48.587
Guys, the police
in Metapan

34:48.654 --> 34:51.890
report two more girls missing,
and they're runaways again.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.225
COLBY: This one here,
Lupe Sandoval?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.693
she talked with her brother
before she left,

34:54.760 --> 34:57.095
said she was only going to be
in the States for, like, a week.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.297
So, same story
as the other three.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.898
I mean, the question is,
what is the connection?

34:59.965 --> 35:01.367
They're young,

35:01.433 --> 35:02.901
they're easy prey...

35:02.968 --> 35:05.070
They all plan to be here
for just a short time.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.138
So, what's that?

35:06.205 --> 35:07.173
Remember the guy

35:07.239 --> 35:08.407
from the Citizen's Border Guard?

35:08.474 --> 35:09.675
He talked about women
crossing the border

35:09.741 --> 35:11.377
to have their babies,
then going right back home.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.644
I know, but all the autopsies
on these girls

35:12.711 --> 35:13.779
said that they weren't pregnant.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.047
Yeah, but Kraft said he got
the feeling

35:16.114 --> 35:17.649
that they were
pregnant, remember?

35:17.716 --> 35:21.153
Wait a minute. What if they
were carrying something else

35:21.220 --> 35:22.521
inside their bodies?

35:23.655 --> 35:24.190
Drugs.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.123
Dope mules

35:25.191 --> 35:26.792
swallow large quantities

35:26.858 --> 35:27.759
of drugs
in latex balloons

35:27.826 --> 35:29.595
and then just waltz
across the border.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.197
And it's the
perfect explanation

35:31.263 --> 35:32.464
for the short stay--
they come over here,

35:32.531 --> 35:34.099
they make their delivery,
and they go right back home.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.668
There you go, only just didn't
work out that way.

35:36.735 --> 35:37.903
Something went wrong,
the drugs wouldn't pass...

35:37.969 --> 35:40.071
Right, someone got greedy.
They didn't want to pay.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.408
Which means that statues
and the candles

35:42.474 --> 35:44.643
and the whole occult thing
was a bluff.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.279
Those girls were cut
open to get to the drugs.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.717
You know, it's hard for me
to believe

35:51.783 --> 35:53.985
that these three young
girls would do this.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.087
I mean, swallow
all those drugs.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.789
Never mind going
to prison.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.092
What would happen if one
of the balloons bursts?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.861
They die.

36:02.928 --> 36:03.895
So why do they do it?

36:03.962 --> 36:05.931
Come on, Dad. I mean,
they come from a place

36:05.997 --> 36:08.834
where they're lucky if they make
40 or 50 bucks a week.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.802
Right, and then somebody
probably offers them

36:10.869 --> 36:12.604
a chance to make $5,000.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.772
What about those
other two girls--

36:13.839 --> 36:15.507
the ones you suspect
of being on their way?

36:15.574 --> 36:16.708
I mean, how are you going
to stop them?

36:16.775 --> 36:18.310
We got their pictures out
to everyone we can.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.645
The border patrol,
the Mexican police.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.879
We're hoping someone
will spot 'em.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.316
And, you know, that's all
we can do.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.917
Actually, you know...

36:25.984 --> 36:27.586
pass me that salt.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.354
Thank you.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.088
Okay. I'm going
to set up

36:30.155 --> 36:31.523
a simple logic
diagram here.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.991
Okay?

36:33.058 --> 36:34.326
Three vertices, okay?

36:34.393 --> 36:36.094
We'll start with the salt

36:36.161 --> 36:37.629
which we'll call
the girls'

36:37.696 --> 36:39.465
home town in El Salvador...

36:39.531 --> 36:40.699
It's Metapan.

36:40.766 --> 36:41.567
Metapan.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.369
And the pepper is Tecate.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.003
And the third vertex,

36:45.070 --> 36:46.605
the glass of water,

36:46.672 --> 36:47.473
is the U.S.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.108
Now, let's look
at the logic issues.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.543
If these girls
did swallow

36:51.610 --> 36:53.412
these drug balloons, they
probably didn't do it

36:53.479 --> 36:54.846
all the way back here
in El Salvador

36:54.913 --> 36:56.248
because the drugs
would then pass

36:56.315 --> 36:57.616
through their body too quickly.

36:57.683 --> 36:58.584
Oh, yeah, that's right,
that's right.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.818
The drugs would pass through

36:59.885 --> 37:01.019
their system before they
even got to the United States.

37:01.086 --> 37:02.388
Yeah, they'd definitely have
to ingest them

37:02.454 --> 37:03.689
pretty close
to the border, right?

37:03.755 --> 37:05.491
Probably Tecate,
which would give them

37:05.557 --> 37:07.158
the time to get the drugs
over the border

37:07.225 --> 37:08.927
into the U.S.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.429
Now, the three vertices

37:10.496 --> 37:12.264
are all part
of the same system.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.365
You find out

37:13.432 --> 37:14.600
how they're connected,

37:14.666 --> 37:15.934
you're going to find another way
to your killer.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.737
The D.E.A. agents
working out of Mexico City

37:18.804 --> 37:21.540
turned up a link between
a drug family in Metapan

37:21.607 --> 37:23.074
and a little pharmacy
in Tecate.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.710
There's our connection.

37:24.776 --> 37:25.577
Take a look at this.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.678
The name on the license

37:26.745 --> 37:27.879
when they pulled it
from the pharmacy.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.348
"Alejandro Borrego."

37:29.415 --> 37:32.418
As in Victor Borrego,
our immigrant advocate.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.420
Colby, we had this S.O.B.
and we let him go.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.587
And this gives him
perfect cover

37:35.654 --> 37:37.623
to be out there patrolling
the border just waiting

37:37.689 --> 37:39.257
for his drug mules
to cross.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.427
Hey, the alert we put out
on the girls just paid off.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.228
The police in Tecate
found Rose Garcia

37:43.295 --> 37:44.663
as she was about
to cross the border.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.598
They X-rayed her stomach--
loaded with drugs.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.100
What about the other one,
Lupe Sandoval?

37:49.167 --> 37:50.469
Rose said she
already crossed.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.404
Which means she's already
in the U.S.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.039
She's headed straight
for Victor Borrego.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.650
Hey, guys?

38:04.716 --> 38:06.184
How we doing
on Borrego?

38:06.251 --> 38:07.419
We have agents
on his house,

38:07.486 --> 38:08.854
but he's nowhere
to be found.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.822
We're trying his cell phone,
hoping to get a GPS fix on him.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.524
If he's out looking
to meet with Lupe Sandoval,

38:12.591 --> 38:13.892
he's probably out
of cell range.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.361
You got anything else?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.962
I mean... anything?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.630
I-I've been over this
with your agents.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.132
I'm still feeling
the importance of water.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.634
Maybe water's nearby, or...

38:22.701 --> 38:25.070
The Colorado River,
the Pacific Ocean...

38:25.136 --> 38:26.171
a bathtub?

38:26.237 --> 38:27.172
All right, Charlie.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.507
We have hard data

38:28.574 --> 38:31.677
on approximately when
Lupe left Tecate

38:31.743 --> 38:34.245
and we know it takes
maybe six to eight hours

38:34.312 --> 38:35.747
for drugs to pass...

38:35.814 --> 38:36.715
And we know

38:36.782 --> 38:38.116
Borrego's preferences

38:38.183 --> 38:39.284
from the last
crime scene.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.285
He's going to want seclusion

38:40.352 --> 38:41.219
and no lights, no people.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.555
-Right.
-He's unlikely

38:43.622 --> 38:44.590
to go back to that first
location

38:44.656 --> 38:45.591
because he knows we've already

38:45.657 --> 38:47.025
-been there.
-Right, so that

38:47.092 --> 38:49.928
eliminates this area here, here

38:49.995 --> 38:51.663
and here.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.365
He's also going to want
to avoid the border patrol

38:53.432 --> 38:54.566
and the Citizens Border Guard.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.867
I remember those
patrol routes

38:55.934 --> 38:57.669
from the earlier model.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.738
Still...

38:59.805 --> 39:00.972
Huge area.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.041
Yeah, but that's not too huge
for an air search? Right?

39:03.108 --> 39:04.009
Call SOG.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.343
Tell them whatever
they got available,

39:05.411 --> 39:07.212
we'd like up
in the air, ASAP.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.914
Okay?

39:10.348 --> 39:13.485
Hey.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.053
Thanks for coming back.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.154
Yeah. Sorry about that.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.255
It's just...

39:17.322 --> 39:18.289
I know. Don't worry about it.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.591
Air unit just spotted
Borrego's truck on

39:19.658 --> 39:21.827
the fire road about six miles
off the MacDaniels turnoff.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.895
-Is the girl with him?
-The IR sensor on

39:23.962 --> 39:25.931
the chopper
shows only one occupant

39:25.997 --> 39:27.265
-in the vehicle.
-She might already be dead.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.400
All right, tell them to maintain

39:28.467 --> 39:29.501
visual contact, but don't
close in.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.836
I'd rather you guys
do that.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.752
( sirens blaring )

39:46.818 --> 39:48.587
( helicopter approaching )

39:59.631 --> 40:00.932
( grunting )

40:03.068 --> 40:04.503
Don't you even breathe!

40:04.570 --> 40:05.971
You're making a mistake!

40:06.037 --> 40:07.272
We made the mistake the first
time we let you go, Victor.

40:07.338 --> 40:08.206
Okay, my arm...

40:08.273 --> 40:09.340
( crackling, groans )

40:09.407 --> 40:11.342
I got something--
a girl's sweater

40:11.409 --> 40:13.244
and it looks like
a bus ticket.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.446
( cocks gun )

40:14.513 --> 40:15.814
-( screams )
-Where is she?

40:15.881 --> 40:18.216
I don't know who
you're talking about.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.084
I found that on my patrol...

40:19.150 --> 40:20.251
Cut the crap, Victor!

40:20.318 --> 40:21.920
-We're not buying it.
-My arm!

40:21.987 --> 40:24.890
I'm giving you
one more chance.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.124
Where is she?!

40:29.761 --> 40:32.564
Look at all this water.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.470
It's okay. It's okay!

40:38.537 --> 40:39.505
No one's going
to hurt you.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.639
We're FBI.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.574
( speaking Spanish )

40:42.641 --> 40:44.075
Policia. Policia....

40:44.142 --> 40:46.111
( speaking Spanish )

40:51.382 --> 40:52.751
That was the hospital.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.252
They got all the drugs
out of the girl

40:54.319 --> 40:56.221
and she's going
to be all right.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.956
Well, I'd say, then,

40:58.023 --> 41:02.594
that we all should be
congratulated.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.030
That is quite a gift.
you have, professor.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.131
Thank you.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.167
Let's leave it at that.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.137
I, uh, I'm going
to hold you

41:12.203 --> 41:13.438
to our deal.

41:13.505 --> 41:14.606
Official mention
in the case file.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.641
Right, you got it.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.042
I just need you to sign
a statement, okay?

41:17.108 --> 41:18.644
Come on.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.881
Agent Reeves...

41:30.055 --> 41:31.389
-You know what the
worst part is? -What?

41:31.456 --> 41:32.423
Is now this guy's
walking around

41:32.490 --> 41:34.059
with an FBI credit
in his pocket?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.761
Which, by the way,
he'll only further exploit

41:35.827 --> 41:37.829
-to fool people.
-You can't rule out everything

41:37.896 --> 41:39.998
-the guy did.
-Of course I can.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.033
Hey, look, he knew
there'd be more victims.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.869
Hey, you know what?
Three dead girls

41:43.935 --> 41:45.837
and the FBI pounding
on his door in a panic.

41:45.904 --> 41:47.272
How hard is that
to deduce?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.807
Hey, you guys,
you still at it?

41:48.874 --> 41:50.075
It's obvious you're not
going to agree on this.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.509
-What about the sketches?
-Because he's...

41:51.577 --> 41:52.711
What about the sketches?

41:52.778 --> 41:54.179
He led us to the bodies.
You tell me how he did that.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.113
I don't know, okay?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.082
But there could be any
number of reasons.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.283
He worked for the CIA.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.585
And the CIA was involved

41:59.651 --> 42:01.052
in the search
for Pablo Escobar,

42:01.119 --> 42:03.288
so he may have an intimate
knowledge of the drug trade.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.322
Charlie, that is so thin.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.124
-I don't think... -I agree
with Don. It's pretty thin.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.794
Oh, and attributing superhuman
powers to a psychic--

42:08.860 --> 42:10.328
yeah, that's thick.

42:10.395 --> 42:11.863
No, listen, I'm not saying
everything he did was real,

42:11.930 --> 42:13.231
but you can't rule...

42:13.298 --> 42:15.233
What was that?

42:15.300 --> 42:16.301
That's Mom's picture.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.404
Oh, don't start to say
that that meant something, okay?

42:19.470 --> 42:22.473
That's spooky.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.242
You know, your mother never
liked it when you guys argued.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.945
Oh, there's many reasons
that that just fell.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.614
Look, it's fallen before.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.648
You were supposed
to put

42:29.715 --> 42:31.282
an earthquake anchor
on that wall, Dad.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.918
What, that's
a coincidence?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.586
Coincidence and nothing more.

42:34.653 --> 42:36.254
Yeah. I don't know.

42:36.321 --> 42:37.923
That's weird.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.827
Coincidence.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.935
( dialing )

42:57.408 --> 42:59.845
Mom, it's Megan.

42:59.911 --> 43:03.148
No, I'm fine, I, uh...

43:03.214 --> 43:06.351
Sorry. I just finished a case
and then...

43:06.417 --> 43:10.255
realized... is Dad there?

43:13.224 --> 43:15.727
No, of course he's
at the club.

43:15.794 --> 43:19.530
Where else would he be
at this hour?

43:19.597 --> 43:20.732
No, no, it's not that important.

43:20.799 --> 43:22.100
I'll call back.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.870
I will.

43:24.936 --> 43:28.239
I will. You get some sleep.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.077
You, too.
