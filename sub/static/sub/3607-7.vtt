WEBVTT

00:20.020 --> 00:23.314
Charlie.

00:23.899 --> 00:27.068
- How about you and I go for a walk?
- No.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.404
No thanks, Locke.
I'm gonna stay in today.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.947
Come on.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.408
Fresh air will do you good.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.417
I take better pictures than that.

00:45.671 --> 00:49.006
Smaller too, if you want
something for your wallet.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.468
I just came by for a few things
and this was...

00:53.303 --> 00:55.471
This was with my stuff.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.642
So you're not staying?

00:59.727 --> 01:03.521
Call me a broken record,
but caves are natural shelter.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.149
And a hell of a lot safer
than living on the beach.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.068
- You're mad at me.
- No.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.195
Kate, I'm...

01:12.322 --> 01:14.907
I just don't understand
why you won't come with me.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.077
Us. It's maybe a mile up there.
If that.

01:18.162 --> 01:21.247
- I'm not setting up house here.
- I want off this island too,

01:21.331 --> 01:23.541
but we know that's not
gonna happen soon.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.584
Sayid has a plan.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.836
To find the source
of the distress code.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.046
The signal's coming from the island.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.675
The signal has been running on a loop
for 16 years, Kate.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.261
And the woman that left it,
she wasn't rescued.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.597
What makes you think
it'll be any different?

01:37.681 --> 01:39.098
I believe it.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.017
I wish I shared your faith.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.811
I wouldn't mind sharing a few things
with her myself.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.939
What do you want, Sawyer?

01:47.024 --> 01:49.484
Heard the doc here
was vacating the premises.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.862
Thought I'd lay claims to my new digs
before somebody else.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.033
I could fix this place up.
Might find somebody to share it with.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.785
I'll talk to you later.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.302
Locke?

02:18.222 --> 02:20.556
Is that you?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.575
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.748
It's been a week
since my last confession.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.125
Go ahead, my son.

02:48.210 --> 02:53.339
Last night,
I had physical relations

02:53.423 --> 02:56.342
with a girl I didn't even know.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.302
I see.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.639
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.767
Right after that I had...

03:05.853 --> 03:09.105
...relations with another girl.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.985
Then straight after that,
I watched

03:14.069 --> 03:16.445
while they had...

03:17.281 --> 03:20.950
...relations with each other.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.453
You see, it's my band, Father.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.997
Drive Shaft.

03:26.081 --> 03:30.209
We've been playing the clubs
in Manchester

03:30.961 --> 03:33.671
and we've been getting some heat.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.425
A following, you know, and...

03:38.427 --> 03:40.553
The girls...

03:40.637 --> 03:45.391
There's some real temptations
that come with the territory...

03:45.475 --> 03:48.102
...if you know what I mean.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.897
Well, we all have our temptations,

03:50.981 --> 03:53.232
but giving in to them,
that's your choice.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.735
As we live our lives,

03:55.819 --> 03:59.155
it's really nothing but a series
of choices, isn't it?

04:00.532 --> 04:03.284
Well, then I've made my choice.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.912
I have to quit the band.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.264
And "the meek shall inherit the earth."

04:25.349 --> 04:27.600
Liam, what are you doing?
This is a church.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.186
- Get your boots off.
- Relax, choir boy.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.064
I bring good tidings of great joy.

04:33.857 --> 04:37.610
We've just been signed
a recording contract.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.154
You're gonna be a rock god.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.426
Nice work, Charlie.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.555
You make excellent bait.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.767
I'm glad I could oblige.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.562
Now give me my bloody drugs.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.170
Did you hear what I said?

05:39.631 --> 05:42.508
I want my drugs back.
I need them.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.719
Yet you gave them to me.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.721
And I bloody well regret it.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.931
I'm sick, man.
Can't you see that?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.851
I think you're a lot stronger
than you know, Charlie.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.477
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.022
I'll let you ask me for your drugs
three times.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.065
The third time,
I'll give them to you.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.485
Now, just so we're clear.
This is one.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.738
Why? Why?

06:03.822 --> 06:06.240
Why are you doing this?
To torture me?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.200
Get rid of them
and have done with it.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.369
If I did that,
you wouldn't have a choice.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.789
Having choices, making decisions
based on more than instinct

06:13.874 --> 06:17.126
is the only thing
that separates you from him.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.300
Three antennae.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.385
Three points of a triangle.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.054
One here on the beach.

06:28.138 --> 06:32.391
Another, Kate will position in the
jungle roughly two kilometers in.

06:32.476 --> 06:36.729
And the third, I'll take
to high ground up there.

06:36.813 --> 06:41.108
If the French transmission is coming
from somewhere within our triangulation,

06:41.193 --> 06:43.277
I'll be able to locate the source.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.405
- But there are two complications.
- Of course there are.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.367
The power cells I've grafted
onto the antennas are dry.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.244
No telling how long they'll last.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.539
A minute. Maybe more.
Maybe less.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.626
So we have to wait
until we're in position.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.754
How are we gonna tell
that we're in the right position?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.298
We have no way to communicate
with each other.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.718
Bottle rockets?

07:07.803 --> 07:10.930
Thank God for firework smugglers.
When I'm in position,

07:11.014 --> 07:12.640
I'll fire off my rocket.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.601
When you two see it,
you fire yours.

07:15.685 --> 07:20.231
As soon as the last one has gone up,
we'll all switch on our antennas.

07:20.315 --> 07:24.068
- You said two complications.
- The battery in the transceiver's dead.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.446
Without the transceiver,
all of this is for nothing.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.865
Something from a laptop
would probably work,

07:29.950 --> 07:34.078
- but I've not found anything.
- I think I might know where to look.

07:35.747 --> 07:39.917
You've been hoarding like a packrat
and you don't have a single laptop?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.961
We are testy.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.922
Still upset about your little breakup?
You and Jacko.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.340
It must be exhausting.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.635
- What's that?
- Living like a parasite.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.471
Always taking, never giving.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.473
Boy, you got me pegged,
don't you?

07:54.558 --> 07:59.145
I get it. You don't want off this island
because there's nothing to go back for.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.273
Nobody you miss.
And no one misses you.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.401
You're feeling sorry for me.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.947
I don't feel sorry for you.
I pity you.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.752
All you had to do was say please.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.220
Dude, what's in these things,
cinder blocks?

08:33.304 --> 08:37.390
Packed everything I thought useful,
without leaving the others short-handed.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.683
You guys need a hand?

08:38.768 --> 08:41.102
I used to lug the band's equipment

08:41.188 --> 08:44.106
before we had roadies
way back in the day.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.901
- Here, let me...
- No, Charlie. The zipper's...

08:47.319 --> 08:48.444
...broken.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.782
- Sorry. I was trying to help.
- I know. It's OK.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.828
Hey, you wanna help me grab
the rest of those bags?

08:57.913 --> 09:00.623
Oh, could I?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.928
What are you doing?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.182
I have a... headache.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.520
Diazepam.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.855
It's for anxiety.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.652
- I was looking for aspirin.
- Pretty strong stuff for a headache.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.820
Yeah, right.

09:32.948 --> 09:36.825
- You OK? You're looking a little...
- It's nothing. It's just a headache.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.872
Charlie, leave it. Go get some water.
Maybe you're dehydrated.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.040
Charlie, I got it.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.669
Go take care of yourself, man.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.004
We don't need you right now.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.356
Come on, Charlie-boy,
we can't do this without you.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.068
You are bloody Drive Shaft.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.570
Watch the language.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.864
This is our shot at the big time.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.033
What? You don't want to be famous?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.703
It's not about that.
I only care about the music.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.038
Your music,
your songs that got us signed.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.791
I'm just a clown with a pretty face
that sings them.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.335
You wanna take away my chance
to be somebody?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.212
Liam, it's not about you.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.715
It's... I love the band...

10:35.302 --> 10:38.887
It's not who I am.
Sometimes I just get lost in it.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.557
Won't happen.
I'll be there looking out for you.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.810
We'll look out for each other.
What brothers do, right?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.021
Right?

10:47.105 --> 10:49.273
Wait, wait, wait.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.317
Just promise me one thing.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.695
If things get too crazy,
no matter what,

10:54.779 --> 10:58.407
if I say we're done,
we walk away.

10:59.451 --> 11:03.037
- We walk away.
- Liam, promise.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.333
We walk away.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.293
You're the rock god, baby brother.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.215
You wanker!

11:51.002 --> 11:53.045
Hey, dude, this yours?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.505
Oh, yeah.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.840
I play bass in Drive Shaft.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.676
I wrote a bunch of tunes on that.
You All Everybody.

11:59.761 --> 12:03.180
Listen, man. Jack just wants you
to find another place for it.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.600
He's moving supplies
and says it's in the way.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.109
You know, a lot of people
look up to me.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.486
- They respect me, and you...
- Charlie...

12:17.570 --> 12:20.322
You treat me like a bloody child,
some useless joke.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.866
- What?
- Charlie's not good enough to do this.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.119
- Charlie's in the way.
- Let me look at you.

12:25.203 --> 12:28.122
You'll look out for me?
We'll look out for each other.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.374
Calm down.
You're not yourself right now.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.252
You don't know me!
I'm a bloody rock god!

12:36.464 --> 12:37.756
Oh, no.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.275
Charlie, where's Jack?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.156
Where's Jack?

13:10.415 --> 13:11.498
Jack!

13:12.750 --> 13:15.544
- Jack, can you hear me?
- I don't know what happened.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.588
We were just talking
and it came down.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.756
- It happened so fast.
- We gotta get help.

13:19.841 --> 13:23.927
- Go down to the beach and get help!
- OK, I'm on it.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.554
And make sure you tell Kate!

13:28.516 --> 13:30.559
What we're doing,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.645
chasing some phantom distress signal,

13:33.730 --> 13:35.522
what are the odds of this working?

13:35.607 --> 13:38.901
No worse than the odds of us
surviving that plane crash.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.488
- People survive crashes all the time.
- Not like this one.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.532
The tail section broke off
when we were still in the air.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.326
Our section cart-wheeled,

13:47.410 --> 13:50.245
and yet we escaped
with nothing but a few scrapes.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.456
How do you explain that?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.124
Blind, dumb luck.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.170
No one's that lucky.
We shouldn't have survived.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.798
Sorry, Sayid,
but some things just happen.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.468
No rhyme, no reason.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.057
- We need help!
- What's wrong, man?

14:10.141 --> 14:12.059
- It's Jack. He's trapped.
- What?

14:12.143 --> 14:14.978
- Our cave collapsed. We've got to go.
- Hey, Scott?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.271
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Scott.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.273
We got an emergency.
Let's go.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.442
- We gotta go now.
- Come on, go, go, go.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.444
Come on, let's go.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.365
Shannon, you have to be ready
to do something important.

14:26.449 --> 14:30.285
At 5:00 sharp, you need
to be ready to turn that antenna on.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.664
- There's a switch at the base.
- Why?

14:33.748 --> 14:36.542
Kate and Sayid
are triangulating the French signal,

14:36.626 --> 14:38.752
but the antenna's power
is really weak,

14:38.836 --> 14:41.713
so you have to wait until
they fire their bottle rockets.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.424
Then you fire this one,
then you turn on the antenna.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.260
Got it?

14:46.970 --> 14:49.888
- The switch is where now?
- Did you hear a word I said?

14:49.973 --> 14:52.432
- Can you or can't you do it?
- Yeah, I can.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.184
OK, OK.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.939
Wait. Kate.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.818
- Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
- Sorry, sport, you just missed her.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.112
Her and Muhammad
headed into the woods.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.114
- Which way?
- Don't sweat it, amigo.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.991
- I know which way they went.
- But...

15:09.075 --> 15:13.620
I'll tell her. You just keep doing
whatever it is you do around here.

15:28.761 --> 15:35.559
You all everybody

15:35.643 --> 15:38.854
Acting like you're stupid people

15:38.938 --> 15:42.190
Wearing expensive clothes

15:42.275 --> 15:53.702
You all everybody

16:01.711 --> 16:04.129
All right! All right, all right.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.923
Hey, mate.
Thanks for coming in.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.014
What the hell was that?

16:14.098 --> 16:16.892
Another kick-ass show.
You were bloody brilliant.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.019
I sing the chorus to You All Everybody.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.771
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.274
I got caught up in the moment.
Like the crowd wanted it, you know.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.027
I know, but if I start
and then you come in after...

16:27.111 --> 16:28.487
She's cool. Let her in.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.740
It won't happen again.
I promise.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.326
Hello, lovely.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.255
Chill, baby brother.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.730
- Wait!
- Jack's in there.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.273
Let me check it out
before you move things.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.443
- If it's unstable...
- How do you know?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.946
Eight years of construction work.
I don't want you near the rocks.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.241
- Take the dog.
- You should get Mr. Locke.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.493
Locke's in the jungle killing stuff.
Who knows where he is.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.167
All right.
This area here is load bearing.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.380
We gotta dig where there's
no danger of the wall buckling in.

17:32.844 --> 17:36.054
All right, here. We dig in here
so the wall doesn't collapse.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.433
Four at a time, by hand,
till we can find some kind of shovel.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.643
We take shifts and go slow.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.396
Whoever isn't digging
should be clearing the rocks

17:44.480 --> 17:48.358
and bringing water to who is working.
OK? Let's move.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.368
What the hell are you doing here?

17:58.453 --> 18:01.163
Easy. I just came
to tell you something.

18:01.247 --> 18:05.041
What makes you think I'm interested
in anything you have to say?

18:13.968 --> 18:16.261
You were right about me.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.556
That I don't help anyone but myself.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.768
Well, here I am.
Ready to pitch in.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.020
You're here to help?

18:26.397 --> 18:29.858
Hey, you act any more surprised,
I'm gonna get offended.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.289
Something wrong, Charlie?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.335
Yeah. Jack.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.836
He's...

18:50.421 --> 18:53.131
There's been an accident
in the caves.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.091
Jack's trapped in a cave-in.

18:57.053 --> 19:01.223
- Is anyone trying to get him out?
- There's a bunch of people there now.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.308
And why aren't you with them?

19:12.819 --> 19:15.195
You didn't come to tell me
about Jack, did you?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.450
I want my stash, Locke.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.579
I can't stand feeling like this.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.293
Come here.
Let me show you something.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.136
What do you suppose
is in that cocoon, Charlie?

19:41.889 --> 19:44.015
I don't know.
A butterfly, I guess.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.936
It's much more beautiful than that.
That's a moth cocoon.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.647
It's ironic.
Butterflies get all the attention.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.899
But moths, they spin silk.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.027
- They're stronger, faster...
- That's wonderful, but...

19:56.112 --> 19:58.947
You see this little hole?

20:00.116 --> 20:02.117
This moth's just about to emerge.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.202
It's in there right now, struggling.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.372
It's digging its way through
the thick hide of the cocoon.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.251
Now, I could help it.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.880
Take my knife,
gently widen the opening,

20:14.964 --> 20:16.590
and the moth would be free.

20:16.674 --> 20:20.176
But it would be too weak to survive.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.222
The struggle is nature's way
of strengthening it.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.893
Now, this is the second time you've
asked me for your drugs back.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.315
Ask me again and it's yours.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.870
Keep going. Keep going.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.216
We're through.
We got a hole.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.760
Jack!

21:01.844 --> 21:03.762
Jack! Can you hear me, Jack?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.476
Come on, dude, answer me.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.359
I hear him!
He's alive. Jack, bro, you OK?

21:19.028 --> 21:21.196
I'm pinned. I can't move.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.370
I can't move.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.707
What do we do?
How do we get him out?

21:37.380 --> 21:40.090
- Charlie was with me.
- He's OK. He made it out.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.342
- Listen, Jack?
- Yeah?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.552
We're gonna get you out of there, OK?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.401
We'll place the second antenna here.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.944
You want to help?

22:04.907 --> 22:09.077
Attach this antenna up in that tree.
As high up as you can.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.621
Golly, thanks, boss.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.838
Five o'clock.
Watch for my flare.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.840
Then it's your turn.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.550
I don't trust him.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.635
Who does?

22:28.597 --> 22:31.016
I don't trust him with you.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.809
I can handle him.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.738
OK. We can't safely
make that tunnel any bigger.

22:44.822 --> 22:48.700
But since Jack can't get out, one of us
is gonna have to go in and unpin him.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.619
- Crawl through that?
- He means someone smaller.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.373
Dude, we don't understand Chinese.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.958
Korean, man.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.086
- They're Korean.
- I'll do it.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.965
Charlie?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.551
No, man.
You're still too shook up.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.678
- I might be able to squeeze...
- Wait.

23:08.763 --> 23:11.765
Who's gonna take care of your son
if something happens?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.936
She's got a husband.
He's got a sister.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.230
I'm alone here.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.316
No one on the island.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.737
Let me do this.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.291
Still ain't five, just like
the last time you checked.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.502
I don't want to miss
Sayid's signal.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.088
I'll fire the flare,
you set off the antenna.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.841
I just thank the good Lord
I got you here to keep reminding me.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.178
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.849
So, what is it about that guy?

23:57.228 --> 23:58.937
Jack.

23:59.021 --> 24:03.942
What is it about him that
makes you all weak in the loins?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.861
Do you try to be a pig
or does it just come naturally?

24:08.155 --> 24:12.742
It's that he's a doctor, right?
Yeah, ladies dig the doctors.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.787
Hell, give me a couple of Band-Aids,
a bottle of peroxide,

24:15.871 --> 24:17.789
I could run this island too.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.583
You're actually comparing yourself
to Jack?

24:23.379 --> 24:26.965
The difference between us
ain't that big, sweetheart.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.468
I guarantee you if he had survived
a few more weeks on this island,

24:30.553 --> 24:33.054
you'd have figured that out.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.890
What did you just say?

24:39.895 --> 24:43.148
Damn. Didn't I tell you?

24:43.232 --> 24:47.527
Word from the valley is Saint Jack
got himself buried in a cave-in.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.823
- What?
- Look at the bright side,

24:51.907 --> 24:54.742
now you have someone else to pity.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.213
Listen, man.
Go slow, all right?

25:07.298 --> 25:10.175
Try not to nudge
any of the rocks around you.

25:10.259 --> 25:14.345
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Good luck.

25:14.972 --> 25:18.600
- Be safe, man.
- Good luck, Charlie.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.977
All right. Thanks, guys.

25:46.754 --> 25:50.381
Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft!
Drive Shaft!

25:53.719 --> 25:56.763
Everybody wants a piece.
Everybody wants more.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.724
Everybody wants another piece.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.393
They can't leave you alone
when you're on top...

26:02.478 --> 26:03.811
Bloody hell.

26:05.147 --> 26:09.734
Hey, baby brother.
Grab a bird and sit down.

26:09.818 --> 26:13.404
Get out.
You too, get out.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.906
- Out!
- Out?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.449
Come on. Now!

26:16.533 --> 26:18.660
Come back in five minutes.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.751
Sound check.
You missed sound check.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.837
You don't show up for rehearsal.
We've got a show in an hour.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.632
A show. I like shows.

26:38.681 --> 26:40.223
All right. That's it.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.476
After tonight,
we cancel the rest of the tour.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.770
- What?
- We walk away.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.105
Are you off your head?

26:47.189 --> 26:49.148
Like we said we would
if things got...

26:49.233 --> 26:52.026
Walk away and go where?

26:52.528 --> 26:56.281
You're killing yourself with this junk.
You're destroying Drive Shaft.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.366
I am Drive Shaft!

26:58.450 --> 27:01.953
No one even knows who
the sodding bass player is.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.872
This is it, Charlie.
End of the rainbow.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.041
You really think you can walk away?

27:07.710 --> 27:09.168
Then what, eh?

27:09.253 --> 27:13.381
Face it. If you're not in this band,
what the bloody hell use are you?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.680
- Liam.
- Piss off!

28:25.454 --> 28:26.621
Charlie?

28:27.331 --> 28:29.123
Charlie, move!

28:29.583 --> 28:31.334
Charlie!

29:01.949 --> 29:03.116
I'm...

29:03.200 --> 29:04.409
I'm here to rescue you.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.542
- We try again.
- We can't leave them.

29:12.626 --> 29:16.087
- They're gonna run out of air.
- Stop talking. I'm trying to think.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.505
Where is he?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.257
- Where is he?
- Kate.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.843
Where is he?
Where's Jack?

29:28.308 --> 29:29.767
He's in there.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.357
Does anyone know if he's alive?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.652
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.697
Charlie went in there
through a tunnel that we dug.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.991
But it collapsed.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.203
Why is nobody digging?

29:56.837 --> 29:59.380
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.969
OK. One, two...

30:05.053 --> 30:06.095
...three!

30:09.725 --> 30:11.434
Sorry, Jack. Sorry.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.561
You all right?

30:15.355 --> 30:18.232
- My shoulder's dislocated.
- What?

30:20.068 --> 30:22.778
- You're gonna have to pop it back in.
- No, I can't.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.697
- I need your help.
- I can't do it.

30:24.781 --> 30:25.990
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.200
Yes, you can.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.286
OK.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.746
What do I do?

30:34.208 --> 30:36.709
- Take my hand.
- This hand? OK.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.961
OK, wait. OK.

30:39.046 --> 30:43.883
Now, when I tell you to,
pull as hard as you possibly can.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.718
Jack, I don't know if I...

30:45.802 --> 30:47.261
You can do this, Charlie.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.224
OK, OK, OK.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.107
Now.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.391
Charlie.
What are you doing here?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.893
A bloke can't pay
his big brother a visit?

31:35.978 --> 31:39.063
Of course you can.
Why didn't you call, you lunatic?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.732
What are you doing in Sydney?

31:41.817 --> 31:43.401
It's all lined up, Liam.

31:43.485 --> 31:47.697
Eight weeks on tour, opening
for some band called Meat Coat.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.909
First gig's in Los Angeles.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.996
LA, Liam.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.749
This is a chance
to get back on a label.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.835
A real one.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.255
This is our comeback.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.509
Charlie, I don't want to come back.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.055
Yeah. Right. Well...

32:13.140 --> 32:15.433
Here's the thing.

32:15.517 --> 32:19.812
They won't book Drive Shaft
without you.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.775
So, I'm asking...

32:24.860 --> 32:26.736
...as a brother...

32:28.322 --> 32:29.864
...the way you asked me.

32:30.907 --> 32:34.368
You were with me the night
I missed Megan's birth.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.748
You were the one I was stumbling around
Dresden with trying to find a fix.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.633
- You're still using, aren't you?
- Don't change the subject.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.968
That's why you haven't
returned my calls.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.596
- You gonna do this tour?
- You said you'd get help.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.680
I lost your number.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.475
- You're still a junkie.
- You did this to me!

32:57.559 --> 32:59.685
It was about the music.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.066
Music, Liam.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.736
You took that away from me.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.030
Listen.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.824
Why don't you stay with us
for a few weeks?

33:13.909 --> 33:15.826
Karen and me,
we can get you help.

33:15.911 --> 33:19.288
- Sydney's got really good programs...
- Forget it.

33:19.373 --> 33:20.665
Don't go.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.167
- Thanks for your help.
- Stay. Please.

33:23.251 --> 33:27.421
- I was just looking out for you.
- You never looked out for me.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.260
I have a plane to catch.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.898
How long has it been?

33:46.608 --> 33:48.693
I don't know what
you're going on about.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.444
How long since your last fix?

33:57.244 --> 33:58.786
Almost a day and a half.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.958
How's the withdrawal treating you?
Any hallucinations?

34:04.042 --> 34:08.170
Apart from the conversation I had with
you about an hour ago in the jungle.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.255
No, not really.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.594
Why didn't you say anything?
I could've helped you through this.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.639
Yeah. You thinking I'm useless
and a junkie to boot.

34:19.725 --> 34:23.060
Useless? You're not useless.

34:23.145 --> 34:26.480
That took a lot of guts getting in here
and trying to rescue me.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.315
I won't forget that.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.985
For the rest of our lives?

34:36.032 --> 34:40.828
At the rate we're using our oxygen
in here, that won't be too long.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.792
This place reminds me of confession.

34:46.877 --> 34:50.838
Those little claustrophobic booths.

34:51.465 --> 34:54.925
I wouldn't have taken you
for a religious man.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.553
I used to be.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.389
You want to hear my confession?

35:00.474 --> 35:02.475
It might take a while.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.310
Hey, I'm no saint, either.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.149
What's wrong?

35:10.901 --> 35:13.569
- It's a moth.
- A what?

35:13.653 --> 35:17.114
Right behind you.
There's a bloody moth in here.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.199
Look.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.995
Charlie, what are you doing?

35:39.554 --> 35:41.222
Kate, you need to take a break.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.517
I'm fine.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.272
We've got enough people to dig.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.317
You keep going at this pace,
you're gonna kill yourself.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.406
There's light.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.201
- What?
- I can see light.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.071
Hey, it's the doctor!

36:55.213 --> 36:56.547
Easy.

36:56.631 --> 37:00.134
My shoulder, careful.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.428
- How did you get out?
- Charlie.

37:02.512 --> 37:05.139
- Charlie found a way out.
- Dude, you rock.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.769
You OK?

37:17.611 --> 37:19.236
- Nice work.
- You did it, man.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.572
Thanks. Thank you.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.385
All right, everyone.
Now it's your turn.

37:43.470 --> 37:48.682
We're in Malibu part of the year,
but the guys there are such idiots...

37:51.853 --> 37:54.063
Damn it.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.357
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

38:07.744 --> 38:10.454
Come on, Kate. Come on.
One more. One more.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.998
Come on, Kate.
Come on.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.463
Yes. Yes.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.974
Where are you?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.852
Yes!

38:35.605 --> 38:38.232
Where are you?
Where are you?

38:58.128 --> 39:00.045
Dude, you feeling OK?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.922
- You look a little...
- Flu.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.466
- He's got the flu.
- Oh, man, that's rough.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.261
After all you've been through.
Take it easy, man.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.118
I think I'm gonna stretch my legs.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.551
This place is cool.
Can we live here?

40:04.194 --> 40:05.694
Made you something.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.156
My very first sling.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.076
How's that?

40:12.160 --> 40:14.119
Good.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.163
Thank you.

40:17.499 --> 40:21.502
So these are the safe caves
you've been going on about.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.045
This was a fluke.

40:23.129 --> 40:27.382
Michael checked out the integrity
of the rest, gave them an OK.

40:29.719 --> 40:33.305
- You're headed back to the beach, huh?
- Sayid should be back by now,

40:33.389 --> 40:35.015
and if his plan worked then...

40:35.100 --> 40:38.143
Then we're one step closer
to getting off this island.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.197
Thanks for the sling, Kate.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.575
You're welcome.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.224
Give them to me.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.312
This is the third time.

41:22.397 --> 41:26.400
- Are you sure you really want it?
- I've made my choice.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.391
I'm proud of you, Charlie.

42:03.313 --> 42:04.897
I always knew you could do it.
