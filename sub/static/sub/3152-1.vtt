01:43.334 --> 01:44.417
That's cool.

01:44.584 --> 01:46.667
If you have something to smoke ...

01:47.584 --> 01:49.084
There's more.

01:49.251 --> 01:51.376
- Either you empty a dope and looks

01:51.542 --> 01:54.709
two retarded teenagers or ...
we drop the case.

01:54.876 --> 01:57.667

- Right Now.
- Right Now.

02:09.376 --> 02:59.084
...

03:00.917 --> 03:02.042
- So?

03:02.209 --> 03:04.667
- We are the only
to smoke "Oinj" here?

03:04.834 --> 03:06.709
- In "bédave" they say,
youth.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.542
- You have kids?
- Yes.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.459
- I bet I have more.
- Not sure.

Wait.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.751
- That is tobacco.

03:22.001 --> 03:25.167
Here, there is a piece of shit.
A tiny bit.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.292
- What are you doing?

03:27.667 --> 03:29.084
- Uh ... nothing, Chief.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.292
- You have

03:31.501 --> 03:33.167
much smoke?
- Oh no.

03:33.709 --> 03:34.751
Even.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.126
- We did not find a leaf.

03:38.292 --> 03:40.417
- But you make heads ...

03:40.542 --> 03:41.417
- What?

03:42.751 --> 03:45.709
- I know you're lying to me,
both there.

03:47.001 --> 03:49.417
- It is completely paranoid.

03:50.292 --> 03:53.459
- You're smoking in hair. That's it.

03:55.292 --> 03:58.626
It's touching, you got a little
sadness in her eyes,

03:58.834 --> 04:01.251
when thou ponds. It's beautiful.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.292
- You got a light?

04:22.041 --> 04:23.751
There is a knock.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.167
What are you doing here?

04:31.376 --> 04:34.126
- Elsa, it was barely seen,
tonight.

04:34.334 --> 04:36.501
- What we said, Hugo?

04:37.334 --> 04:40.126
- Please, one minute.
I'm cute.

04:40.334 --> 04:43.917
I swear, I can not, I,
find another girl.

04:44.126 --> 04:44.917
- But no.

04:45.167 --> 04:48.876
You want to sound smarter
typing you an old woman.

04:49.084 --> 04:52.917
- What I mind?
It is good love, we laugh,

04:53.126 --> 04:56.876
we're both writers.
We are the perfect couple.

04:57.626 --> 04:59.376
- Bel oxymoron.

04:59.501 --> 05:02.459
- Oh, you're boring,
when you're depressed.

05:02.584 --> 05:04.167
- No. I am lucid.

05:05.626 --> 05:06.876

05:07.292 --> 05:08.751
Oh, great.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.251
No. It was good.

05:10.417 --> 05:13.417
I was happy.
I had made a good argument.

05:13.542 --> 05:16.542
And then,
I went to the evening ...

05:16.709 --> 05:19.042
Julien.
Yeah, he called me.

05:19.251 --> 05:23.084
It was for the book release
Elsa Santorini.

05:23.251 --> 05:26.376
No, it was not boring.
I have a lot of fun.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.584
She's great, that bitch.
Super.

05:29.751 --> 05:32.584
It's funny,
it's cool, relaxed ...

05:32.751 --> 05:34.792
I swear, it would please you.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.542
It could be your great friend.

05:38.251 --> 05:39.459
Huh?

05:39.584 --> 05:40.917
I'll pass.

05:41.126 --> 05:43.876
She says I am
a super good shot.

05:44.084 --> 05:47.042
It is true that it is
a little thanks to you, what.

05:47.417 --> 05:49.792
Oh! Go in there. Fooling around.

05:50.001 --> 05:53.751

Well if it's flattering.

06:03.001 --> 06:04.292
Ben though.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.584
- My friend Peter, he adored you.

06:12.209 --> 06:13.334
- Really?

06:13.501 --> 06:15.334
It's really ...

06:15.501 --> 06:16.792
friendly.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.459
- He's not my friend for nothing.
- It was what, in Rennes?

06:20.876 --> 06:23.876

06:24.084 --> 06:25.709
triple murder:his wife,

06:25.917 --> 06:27.667

06:33.376 --> 06:34.792

06:38.667 --> 06:41.209
- And he is very happy.
- Good.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.042
- His wife is a friend.

06:43.251 --> 06:47.084
- But not freaking out.
It's okay. You know me, right?

06:48.126 --> 06:49.084
- Ben precisely.

06:49.292 --> 06:52.251
- What I'm saying
on married men?

06:52.459 --> 06:54.626
- Married man has no dick.

06:54.834 --> 06:57.417
- It's not my thing
married men.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.667
- Well, so much the better.
- And I have too much respect

07:00.876 --> 07:03.709

to sleep with their husbands.

07:11.042 --> 07:13.376
- It gives me

- Do you really think
that if something happened,

07:32.167 --> 07:35.001
I would talk to you like that?
No shit?

07:36.126 --> 07:38.876
- Why I'm not allowed
to be jealous?

07:39.084 --> 07:43.042
- Because you're married to me.
- You're doing well.

07:46.501 --> 07:48.459

- A mother in the plan.

08:16.876 --> 08:19.042
- But stop to let you speak

08:19.251 --> 08:22.542
like a goat.
Divorce, change of guy.

08:22.751 --> 08:25.792
- If I divorçais,
it would not change the guy.

08:26.042 --> 08:29.584
I even filerais her kids.

they will not miss me.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.751
I swear.
Yeah, really.

08:50.917 --> 08:54.042
They think only three things:
ass, the money ...

08:57.001 --> 08:58.501
Two things, actually.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.209
- Sometimes I feel like

09:00.417 --> 09:04.001
snuggling into my arms
a man who feels bitter orange.

09:04.209 --> 09:06.751
- Say,
you met someone, you.

09:06.917 --> 09:11.501
- But of course. It's still
very accurate, bitter orange.

You've not said, "The poor guy
only one outfit for going out "?

14:39.084 --> 14:40.792
- I thought about it,

14:41.042 --> 14:43.626
but I told myself:
"It's class."

14:44.667 --> 14:45.792
- Bluntly?

14:46.042 --> 14:47.417
- If one says it all ...

14:48.167 --> 14:49.667
- I will not drag, huh.

14:50.334 --> 14:51.501
- Me neither.

14:51.667 --> 14:55.417
My only taboo
is a married man, so ...

14:56.126 --> 14:58.542
- Good. So says.
You're a guy?

14:58.709 --> 15:02.042
You've got children, I know.
But I want to know everything.

15:02.251 --> 15:06.126
- So I do not have any rights.
I just broke. In Rennes.

15:06.292 --> 15:08.126
With a man ...
A young man.

15:08.292 --> 15:09.209
- How old?

15:09.626 --> 15:10.626
- 25.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.042
- Ah, anyway!
Madame!

15:14.209 --> 15:16.584
- I'm dredging
by young people.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.417
- Because you scare them,
other.

15:21.709 --> 15:23.542
It's crazy that I like you.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.751
This is crazy.
- Thank God you not me dredges.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.501
- I do not want to happen
anything.

15:29.626 --> 15:33.417
I love my wife, I'm faithful.
But hey, you ...

15:33.542 --> 15:34.584
You ...

15:34.792 --> 15:37.751
- She is lucky, your wife.
She knows?

15:37.917 --> 15:39.459
- I do not know.

15:42.334 --> 15:43.667
- Damn, you're here!

15:43.876 --> 15:48.167
You know what? I drove a shovel
the friend of my son.

15:48.334 --> 15:51.209
Still, it sends wood
at that age.

15:51.376 --> 15:52.792
- I present to you Peter.

15:53.001 --> 15:54.876
- Oh, the guy from Rennes.

15:55.084 --> 15:59.167
- Exactly, the guy from Rennes.
- Come, let's blow out the candles.

15:59.334 --> 16:03.167
- I told them that I had met
an extraordinary man, but ...

16:03.334 --> 16:05.126
- But? But?

16:11.459 --> 16:14.876
- It's the lose! I'm 40!

16:19.709 --> 16:21.376
- Thank you.

16:23.876 --> 16:25.876
- It's okay? Who is it?

16:26.084 --> 16:28.459
- It is a meeting.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.042
- Very, very beautiful.

16:30.251 --> 16:31.667
No, but really.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.209
That is ugly.

...

17:28.126 --> 18:04.001
...

18:14.751 --> 18:17.417
- We could have shared
the same taxi.

18:18.667 --> 18:22.917
- Believe me, it is advantageous
to not share the same taxi.

18:24.584 --> 18:26.917
- You know what is the worst?

18:27.126 --> 18:28.459
- No.

18:31.542 --> 18:34.209
- Because you smell
bitter orange.

18:34.376 --> 18:36.209
- You know it, you?

18:40.417 --> 18:43.376
I do not know
what makes me most afraid.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.751
If it's you again

18:46.626 --> 18:48.376
or never see you again.

18:51.292 --> 18:52.917
- For me it's both.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.584
- We will not take the numbers?

18:56.751 --> 18:58.709
- Excuse me?
- From phone.

19:01.084 --> 19:02.709
It is useless, right?

19:04.459 --> 20:26.417
...

20:26.584 --> 20:28.917
- File Solal against Solal.

20:30.334 --> 20:31.876
- We will not take the numbers.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.251
It's simpler.

20:35.459 --> 20:36.334
Huh?

20:36.501 --> 20:39.376
That's boring,
but it is simpler.

20:42.501 --> 21:00.834
...

21:03.626 --> 21:04.834
I like you.

21:21.584 --> 21:50.042
...

21:53.167 --> 21:55.626
Go. Come on, baby. Come.

21:55.792 --> 21:56.834
Do not worry.

21:57.626 --> 21:59.084
- It's okay, Dad?

21:59.251 --> 22:00.584
- Yes, it will.

22:18.001 --> 22:19.084
- You're there?

22:19.251 --> 22:21.667
- Yeah. And you?
- Yeah. What are you doing?

22:21.834 --> 22:23.167
- Nothing special.

22:23.334 --> 22:25.834
- Why do you want to break?

22:26.042 --> 22:28.709
- I wanted to get a girl
and you were there.

22:28.917 --> 22:31.042
- Basically
I'm your stopgap?

22:31.209 --> 22:32.709
- Take not the "seum."
- Bolosse.

25:05.209 --> 25:06.542

You want that?

But first,
Hector, he wants a little kiss.

Better than that.

There was that?

Which one, Quentin?

26:29.126 --> 26:31.292
- Why?
- No. For nothing.

26:32.251 --> 26:33.917
- The brown khaki, there.

26:34.167 --> 26:37.334
- Oh yeah? But it is ridiculous.
It looks like a dwarf.

26:37.501 --> 26:41.126
He's not very mature air.
- Well, he is 13 years old, listening.

26:41.292 --> 26:42.126

The girls at the same age,
you look

- Hi.

28:31.626 --> 28:51.917
...

28:52.167 --> 28:53.376
- I found

28:53.542 --> 28:57.626
jurisprudence. It says:
"The offense may be established;

28:57.834 --> 29:01.917
"Even in a private place."
We can use the same judgment.

29:02.501 --> 29:05.667

We're not going to throw in there

29:05.876 --> 29:07.459
headlong, right?

29:08.626 --> 29:10.042
- "For the Heart"?

29:13.501 --> 29:15.334
- Yes. That being said, right?

29:16.417 --> 29:17.709
- So?
- What?

29:17.917 --> 29:19.001
- You're the typed?

29:19.209 --> 29:21.459
- But no. It will not.

29:21.584 --> 29:23.542

29:23.751 --> 29:25.042
it's not easy.

you were going to knock you.

- Val,

29:31.292 --> 29:32.626
he is married!

29:34.792 --> 29:36.001
- It looks great.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.542

29:41.917 --> 29:43.084
- No. Collapsed.

29:50.501 --> 29:51.334
- It's ugly.

29:51.501 --> 29:54.292
- Oh yeah. It's ugly,
but it's like that.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.542

this story

29:57.709 --> 30:01.292
this is no coincidence.
- Oh, yes. Oh yes, it's a chance.

30:01.501 --> 30:03.376
I am very happy.
- Yes.

30:03.501 --> 30:04.376
- Yeah.

30:04.542 --> 30:07.209
- That's what you wanted
flee to Brazil?

30:07.376 --> 30:10.626
"To change your little life
bourge of narrow "?

30:10.834 --> 30:13.501
- I had a life,
before getting married, me.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.084
I fucked miles.

30:16.251 --> 30:17.709
I feel like that.

30:17.876 --> 30:20.251

Simply, if you meet her
Now, your ...

This girl has upset you.

30:30.251 --> 30:35.417
I've never seen you like this.
You were so ... alive.

- And so?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.501
- "And so," shit!

30:38.626 --> 30:40.376
- I have to do what?

30:40.501 --> 30:43.584
I must go
the jump in secret.

30:43.751 --> 30:46.626
After I announced to the family
I left them.

30:46.792 --> 30:49.584

He again the thrill
when he makes love.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.334
No, but ...

30:54.501 --> 30:58.792
You really think I'm
and bastard and con to this point?

30:59.542 --> 31:02.084
- Watch out, though.
- What?

31:02.251 --> 31:05.584
- Because the one who wants to leave
Brazil

31:05.751 --> 31:07.501
it will let you go longer.

31:07.626 --> 31:10.084
And there is no evidence that he is wrong.

31:10.292 --> 31:14.667
- You know, the hero today
contrary to what you may believe,

31:14.834 --> 31:17.376
it's not the one who leaves his wife,

31:17.501 --> 31:19.417
is the one who stays with.

31:19.542 --> 31:22.834
- What do you have to fuck,
to be a hero?

31:23.751 --> 31:26.209
With that, coffee. Coffee?
- Coffee.

31:26.417 --> 31:27.917
- Send him a text message.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.584
- Genre?
- Wait two seconds.

31:30.751 --> 31:34.667
- Find her, the sentence does not
false advertising.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.209
"Your life will be better

31:36.417 --> 31:38.917
"With me."
- Why are you so negative?

31:39.167 --> 31:40.501
Why would it be

31:40.709 --> 31:43.501
false advertising?
- No, but ...

31:43.709 --> 31:46.251
Be the centerpiece of someone,

31:46.459 --> 31:48.001
I find it degrading.

31:48.209 --> 31:50.001
And I have not the number.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.084
- It's stupid.

31:52.542 --> 31:53.542
- Yeah.

31:53.751 --> 31:56.042
- But ... you got his number?

31:56.209 --> 31:57.584
- Nope.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.417
- It makes you not fuck?

31:59.542 --> 32:00.792
- Ben though.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.292
- You like?

32:04.167 --> 32:05.084
- In scoot.

I would not have married you.

Yes, it's not stupid. Yes.

35:16.376 --> 35:17.876

35:35.376 --> 35:38.251

Oh dear ...

- Are you kidding me here?
- I'll call you

35:49.084 --> 35:52.459
it's important to play
with her children, according to Marcel Rufo.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.292
- Check Marcel Rufo

35:55.501 --> 35:57.042
Anything.

We played 10 minutes.

36:18.126 --> 36:22.834
Poor ten minutes of relaxation
in a day of crazy.

36:23.042 --> 36:25.334
I waited 20 minutes
by caterers

36:25.501 --> 36:28.792
that Mrs
is not done shit to cook.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.917

And besides,

36:33.167 --> 36:36.042
she has her period.
- Very stylish. Enjoy your meal.

36:36.251 --> 36:38.126

Come on, we move on.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.376
- It's not happening like that, me.

37:08.542 --> 37:11.334
- It can be light,
some tonight?

37:11.501 --> 37:14.792
We will not divorce?
Why do the face?

37:15.584 --> 37:16.542
This is stupid.

37:16.709 --> 37:19.209
- You know what,

37:19.417 --> 37:23.042

37:41.334 --> 37:43.084

37:43.292 --> 37:45.751
- The pension not give you
all rights.

37:46.001 --> 37:47.251
- You, you make your head.

37:48.167 --> 37:51.042
- You already have two slices.
Do not fuck.

37:51.251 --> 37:54.667
- But hush, little one.
You're 13 years old. Go to bed.

37:54.876 --> 37:57.459

37:57.584 --> 38:01.001
- Why?
For more see your face rotten rat.

38:01.209 --> 38:02.792
- Mom, why do you say anything?

38:03.042 --> 38:05.626
He insults me, and you, you say nothing.

38:05.834 --> 38:08.292
- Lily, did you see how you talk to him?

38:08.501 --> 38:09.626
- But it tears me

38:09.834 --> 38:12.626

38:17.334 --> 38:18.292
- Oh, that sucks.

38:18.459 --> 38:21.667
It will not happen

38:21.834 --> 38:24.042
- I'm tired. What do you want?

38:24.209 --> 38:26.376
- Well now, you look at me.

38:37.417 --> 38:39.167
- What are you thinking?

38:39.584 --> 38:40.917
- Excuse me?

38:41.126 --> 38:44.167
- You look at me
but you think of something else.

38:44.334 --> 38:46.376
- No. I look at you.

38:53.376 --> 38:54.834
- And?

38:58.126 --> 38:59.459
- Come.

39:17.501 --> 39:18.876
- Damn! Buffering.

39:19.334 --> 39:20.584
Fuck.

39:24.042 --> 39:27.501
- I've already told you
not to download illegally.

39:27.667 --> 39:32.126
- Mom, you're streaming.
It's not downloading.

39:32.292 --> 39:34.126
- What's the difference?

39:34.292 --> 39:36.709
- I've already explained a thousand times.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.459
- Oh, that's okay.

39:39.167 --> 39:42.459
What is it?
- You see the brown, there?

39:42.584 --> 39:44.667
He is in love with the blonde.

39:44.876 --> 39:46.876
But it is a normal human.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.876
And he's a vampire.

39:49.126 --> 39:50.667
They see that night.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.834
- What is
"Normal human"?

39:53.084 --> 39:55.501
- Well ... I do not know. Like you.

39:57.126 --> 39:58.667
- I'm normal, I?

39:58.834 --> 40:00.709
- Except when you fart a cable.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.126
- Yeah.
Not very sexy, all that.

40:03.292 --> 40:06.334
- Anyway, it is not
normal girls.

40:06.501 --> 40:09.251
- Oh, the macho!
- But what a macho!

40:14.126 --> 40:15.834
- Ben then?
- What?

40:16.501 --> 40:19.209
- Have you met someone?
- No. Why?

40:19.376 --> 40:22.334
- You call me.
- We parted, Hugo.

40:22.501 --> 40:25.084
- Normally,
you remind me after 5 days.

40:25.251 --> 40:28.501
- 5 days? Have you counted?
- Maximum.

40:28.626 --> 40:32.126
- And the gift of Julien?
- An edition of the Red and the Black

40:32.334 --> 40:35.126
signed by Stendhal.
- Not bad!

40:35.334 --> 40:37.167
- I am entitled to a kiss?

40:37.376 --> 40:38.584
- Not bad.

40:40.292 --> 40:43.126
You're boring.
- No, but it's you. Deceitful.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.917
Come.

40:46.001 --> 40:47.459
- Stop.

40:48.209 --> 40:52.001
- Where's my white shirt,
with cufflinks?

40:52.167 --> 40:53.001
- I do not know.

40:53.209 --> 40:57.459
Why do not you put the blue?
- No. I put it the last time.

40:57.584 --> 40:59.126
- What last time?

41:00.792 --> 41:04.042
- I said it like that.
I do not want to

41:04.251 --> 41:08.251
the same shirt pretext ...
- "Pretext"?

41:09.376 --> 41:11.292
- Wait, this is not war.

41:11.459 --> 41:16.251
I just want to
a shirt other than blue.

41:16.459 --> 41:17.501
It's not a crime.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.417
- No, but it just goes to Julien.

41:21.292 --> 41:22.834
- Yes. You're right.

41:23.042 --> 41:24.334
- Yeah.

41:24.501 --> 41:27.542
Want. It is there,
your shirt, too.

41:27.709 --> 41:29.667
- Look.
I tell you buttons.

41:29.834 --> 41:32.292
- Well then, is that one, there.

41:32.459 --> 41:34.584
You do not know to look, eh?

41:36.626 --> 41:40.084
- Where's the gift of Julien?
I laugh more.

41:40.251 --> 41:42.501
Where is he?
- Maw not. I know.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.584
- He was there.
- But what is it?

41:44.751 --> 41:48.626
- This is an autographed edition
The Red and the Black. That's why

41:48.834 --> 41:51.042
his name is Julien.
- What is the relationship?

41:51.251 --> 41:53.542
- Read the book, you'll understand.

41:53.709 --> 41:56.209
- But how did worship.
- Talk

41:56.417 --> 41:59.459
like that to your mother, Julie?
- Well ... it depends.

41:59.626 --> 42:04.751
- What is this chav mode?
"Worship", it comes to worship,

42:05.001 --> 42:08.834
meaning admire.
Genre:Mom, I venerate you.

42:09.917 --> 42:11.001
Hello?

42:11.167 --> 42:12.042
Yeah, Hugo.

42:12.209 --> 42:15.001
I ordered a taxi.
See you there.

42:15.167 --> 42:17.376
I do not want to put a helmet.

42:17.542 --> 42:21.167
- Damn, it makes me tired.
- I found not the gift of Julian.

42:21.751 --> 42:23.501
That's it, I found it.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.001
Yes. Super.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.292
Hugo, you do not do it sucks, huh?

42:27.459 --> 42:29.876
We are no longer together, okay?

42:30.126 --> 42:32.501
Bon. We speak just now?

42:32.709 --> 42:35.501
- It's going to yell for keys.
You bet?

42:35.667 --> 42:37.084
- OK. Go ahead.
- OK.

42:37.251 --> 42:39.042

42:49.626 --> 42:51.376
my keys.
- Were picked anything.

42:53.417 --> 42:57.834
The girls, in 10 minutes,
you turn off the computer.

42:58.084 --> 43:01.834
If you are late tomorrow
at school, Julie, I invite you over.

43:02.042 --> 43:04.084
- I promise, ma'am.
- Yeah ...

43:04.292 --> 43:06.292
Too polite to be honest.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.126
Ciao, pupuce.

43:17.792 --> 43:20.292
Are you serious?
Go on, get out.

43:22.459 --> 43:24.834
I'm sure
she has a new boyfriend.

43:25.084 --> 43:27.209
- You take it?
- No. I hate it.

43:27.376 --> 43:31.001
- It's not Louis XIV, the hair?
- But no.

43:31.501 --> 43:33.584

It's okay?

43:33.751 --> 43:35.417

You are beautiful, my love.

44:04.751 --> 44:07.292
Stop trying to predict everything
like this.

44:07.667 --> 44:10.709
- It serves to reassure me.
- What are you afraid?

44:14.501 --> 44:16.334
- Ah! They came!

44:40.001 --> 44:41.542
- Good evening. Magic.

44:44.417 --> 44:46.667
- Oh no! But you're crazy.

44:46.876 --> 44:49.167
This gave me mad
an original work

44:49.376 --> 44:51.876
signed by the author.
- By Stendhal?

44:52.126 --> 44:53.251
- Jean-Claude, his cousin.

44:53.459 --> 44:54.834
It was cheaper.

44:59.001 --> 45:01.417
- It's funny.
- There's really only you

45:01.584 --> 45:03.417
to find it myself.

45:03.584 --> 45:06.751
- Good. Who wants to drink that?
Who wants to drink what?

45:07.001 --> 45:11.417
Why did I say that?
- I work tomorrow so ...

45:11.584 --> 45:13.751
- A Saturday?
- Yes. I am antiquarian.

45:15.501 --> 45:16.376
- It's okay?

45:16.542 --> 45:18.792
- Honey, your gift rained.

45:21.667 --> 45:22.751
- Do you like it?

45:23.001 --> 45:26.334
- I love it. As against,
I would need an update here ...

45:26.501 --> 45:28.334
You are together, not together?

45:28.501 --> 45:31.417
- But of course,
we're together. Why?

45:32.001 --> 45:35.251
- I present to you a millionaire
who rebuilt his apartment.

45:35.459 --> 45:36.917
She wants to meet you.

45:37.167 --> 45:40.126
- A billionaire
it will not refuse.

45:40.334 --> 45:43.292
- Hugo, we need to talk
your script.

45:46.834 --> 45:50.209
- They all left us.
They not realize.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.751
It is he, 25 years?
- Yes.

45:54.917 --> 45:56.334
- Well!

45:57.792 --> 46:00.501
I have no right to be jealous.
- Oh yes.

46:00.626 --> 46:02.501
It makes me very happy.

46:03.709 --> 46:05.626
- I still have my Louis XIII.

46:05.834 --> 46:08.209
I want something
more new.

46:08.417 --> 46:09.792
- You did it.

46:10.292 --> 46:14.084
- What?
- To change the shirt.

46:14.251 --> 46:17.292
- I'm happy
you to see him.

46:17.501 --> 46:20.251
- If you could put that in ...

46:20.501 --> 46:21.751
- It's okay?

46:21.917 --> 46:23.917
- Forgiveness. Yeah.

46:24.709 --> 46:27.334
- You seem a little nervous.
- No. It's okay.

46:27.501 --> 46:30.001
No. Okay, it's okay.

46:30.542 --> 48:29.167
...

48:29.542 --> 48:32.376
- You need
more information?

48:33.501 --> 48:56.376
...

48:57.501 --> 49:00.626
- It's okay, Mom?
- Why would not it?

49:00.834 --> 49:02.126
- You look sad.

49:02.334 --> 49:05.376
- Like every Sunday,
when you leave again.

49:05.542 --> 49:07.709
- Again, you're sad
than usual.

49:07.876 --> 49:10.501
- No. It's okay.
- I'm here, Mom.

49:12.834 --> 49:14.292
I love you.
- Me too.

49:14.709 --> 49:15.792
- I love you.

49:19.084 --> 49:19.542
- Dad!

49:21.042 --> 49:22.167
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

49:22.501 --> 49:23.584
You want?

49:23.834 --> 49:25.834
- Oh, the other!
- Honey!

49:26.542 --> 49:27.751
Cuckoo.

49:27.917 --> 49:28.917
- That's fine.

49:29.751 --> 49:31.334
You're strong, my son.

49:33.292 --> 49:35.834
- I'll get water.
I thirst.

49:36.084 --> 50:07.167
...

50:07.584 --> 50:11.209
- You want some tea? Water?
- No, no. Thank you. It's good.

50:13.251 --> 50:16.584
- Good. Your book out
next month in England.

50:16.751 --> 50:19.417
It would be nice
you to go.

50:20.167 --> 50:21.209
Really.

50:21.501 --> 50:24.376
- With children, it's not easy.

50:24.542 --> 50:25.542
- Two days.

50:25.709 --> 50:28.417
It will pass
as a letter in the mail.

50:28.542 --> 50:29.459
- I do not want.

50:29.584 --> 50:30.459
There is a knock.

50:30.626 --> 50:31.917
- Yes. I arrive.

50:32.126 --> 50:33.917
One second. Think about it.

50:48.501 --> 50:49.709
- Pierre Solal.

50:50.251 --> 50:51.917
06 53 14 49 30.

50:54.167 --> 50:56.084
06 53 ...

50:58.459 --> 50:59.917
06 53 14 49 30.

51:00.126 --> 51:02.292
06 53 14 49 30.
June 53 14 ...

51:02.459 --> 51:05.376
What?
- England, have thought you?

51:05.501 --> 51:06.917
- This is good.
- Is it good?

51:07.167 --> 51:08.417
- June 53 14 ...

51:08.542 --> 51:11.042
- So 22, 23 blocks you?
- June 53 ...

51:11.251 --> 51:13.792
- 22, 23.
- You send me mail?

51:14.001 --> 51:14.792
14 ... 49 ... 30

51:15.042 --> 51:17.167
- Note "22, 23". It's easy.
- OK.

51:17.334 --> 51:19.084
June 53 14 ...
- Or 25, 26.

51:19.251 --> 51:20.459
- No.

51:20.584 --> 51:21.917
- June 53 40 ...
- Otherwise, the 30.

51:22.251 --> 51:24.917
- No. 06 53 14 49 30.

51:25.167 --> 51:29.542
- ... The exercise under
the right of first refusal following:

51:30.001 --> 51:32.792
operations donations
contributions ...

51:33.001 --> 51:36.792
- If we could see in daylight
like two normal human?

51:37.001 --> 51:40.209
With a little luck,
we found zero. Eisa.

51:46.084 --> 51:49.251
- Who is the unconscious
Who gave you my number?

51:50.667 --> 51:54.042
- I stole it from the BlackBerry
Julien. It's wrong.

51:57.126 --> 51:59.334
- I do not feel that one is zero,

51:59.501 --> 52:02.376
and even less
that is not zero.

52:03.334 --> 52:06.667
I can get over to chance,
for us.

52:09.251 --> 52:12.542
- Chance is when God
wants to remain anonymous.

52:14.542 --> 52:16.167
- I deleted your number.

52:20.251 --> 52:23.209
It's impossible.
It is engraved in my memory.

52:42.167 --> 52:44.709
- "La mujer the vamos a ..."
- No.

52:45.501 --> 52:47.084
- What?
- No.

52:47.292 --> 52:49.584
- The "mujer", it "vamos" it.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.917
"Vamos" is plural, honey.

52:53.167 --> 52:57.042
They speak Portuguese in Brazil.
It is there that you want to go?

52:57.209 --> 52:58.626
- No. Not now.

52:58.834 --> 53:01.501
- Where are you at,
with Romeo and Juliet?

53:01.709 --> 53:04.751
- He writes a little too weird for me
Shakespeare.

53:04.917 --> 53:06.209
I can buy it

53:06.417 --> 53:07.751
iTunes?

53:08.001 --> 53:10.667
It is so beautiful,
Dicaprio, inside.

53:12.292 --> 53:13.542
- Good. Dad?
- Yes?

53:13.709 --> 53:17.251
You got more air to be
with your texting with me.

53:17.501 --> 53:19.501
- I'm here.
- Hardly.

53:20.501 --> 53:21.792
- Let's go again.

53:22.001 --> 53:24.167
- La mujer will ...

53:27.376 --> 53:30.792
- Lily, I can not all the time
make up your shots.

53:31.042 --> 53:35.084
- Have you seen a ton
homework they give me?

53:37.084 --> 53:38.334
Let's see?

53:39.126 --> 53:41.251
But you've gone.
- It's pretty.

53:41.459 --> 53:42.417
- But no.

53:42.584 --> 53:45.292
There is China,
then Russia.

53:46.084 --> 53:47.709
Anything.

53:58.334 --> 53:59.501
Who is it?

54:01.917 --> 54:04.334
- The bank,
If you want to know everything.

54:05.292 --> 54:06.584
- They say what?

54:07.667 --> 54:09.834
- That I am richer than expected.

54:11.459 --> 54:15.834
- We'll go shopping on Saturday?
- OK. We're going shopping.

54:27.042 --> 54:28.376
And if he has not?

54:28.501 --> 54:30.542
- We pass the evening together.

54:30.709 --> 54:32.876
- I harasses, eh?
- Grave.

54:33.126 --> 54:34.542
- Stop.
- I kidding.

54:34.709 --> 54:37.417
- If his wife is there?
- No. Not these evenings.

54:37.584 --> 54:39.542
- So I should not be there.

54:39.709 --> 54:41.667
- If you like, we go not.
- No.

54:41.876 --> 54:44.167
- Are you calm?
- My Bag!

54:44.334 --> 54:45.417
- Here.
- Thank you.

54:45.584 --> 54:48.084
- Looks like you're out of HP.
- This is terrible.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.876
- There is no cHaffreux. "
You're sublime.

54:51.084 --> 54:54.001
Tonight, the guy
you put pit.

54:57.626 --> 54:58.834
- I'll rrïévanouir.

54:59.042 --> 55:01.542
- Here, emissions arm.
Tightens the muscle.

55:02.542 --> 55:06.376
- Thank you, huh, Mark.
- You're crazy or what?

55:13.751 --> 55:15.834
It's okay?
What up?

55:17.667 --> 55:19.459
- What are you doing here?

55:19.626 --> 55:23.626
- I came with my friend Mark.
He is a lawyer too.

55:23.834 --> 55:27.209
- It is I who takes
in the evenings a little chiantes.

55:27.417 --> 55:29.084
Display
with a star,

55:29.292 --> 55:30.709
it's good for the image.

55:30.917 --> 55:33.209
- All right, that. I'm interested.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.126
- I'll go to the locker room.

55:35.626 --> 55:37.626
Queuing.
See you later.

55:38.084 --> 55:40.667
- I expected at all,
but not that.

55:40.834 --> 55:42.042
- Yes. It's a little ...

55:43.209 --> 55:44.042
- Dangerous.

55:45.501 --> 55:47.126
This is a hotel here.

55:47.334 --> 55:49.376
- Individual.
- And more,

55:49.542 --> 55:55.376
're not like you, but not at all
sublime in your tight dress ...

55:55.834 --> 55:56.709
- Peter?

55:56.876 --> 55:57.709
It then.

55:57.917 --> 55:59.834
It's been a while.

56:00.042 --> 56:02.292
All is well?
- Yes. All is well.

56:03.084 --> 56:04.834
- You are his wife?
Nice to meet you.

56:05.084 --> 56:07.542
I was a friend of Peter, in college.

56:07.751 --> 56:09.251
- I'm not his wife.

56:09.459 --> 56:10.751
- So you got divorced?

56:11.001 --> 56:12.376
- No. Not at all.

56:12.501 --> 56:14.542
- If you have need a lawyer ...

56:14.709 --> 56:17.126
- Thank you, I do not need.

56:17.334 --> 56:18.626
It's going very well.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.501
- I dropped my husband.
I'll go.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.376
Mark, honey, I'm going.

56:24.709 --> 56:27.001
OK? Good evening.
- Good evening.

56:27.459 --> 56:28.459
- Bye.

56:28.626 --> 56:31.292
- It makes me really happy
to see you.

57:24.667 --> 57:32.167
...

57:35.292 --> 57:36.417
- Jade?

57:39.042 --> 57:40.209
Jade, you do not sleep?

57:50.001 --> 57:53.376
- This is horrible.
They love each other and they are missed.

57:53.834 --> 57:54.792
- Who?

57:55.001 --> 57:56.542
- Romeo and Juliet.

57:59.501 --> 58:03.042
- You bought it, finally?
- You told me yes.

58:03.667 --> 58:05.459
It was good, your party?

58:11.126 --> 58:14.292
- Do not worry.
They will love you for eternity.

58:14.459 --> 58:16.876
- This is for bolosses,
eternity.

58:17.084 --> 58:18.626
- Well, I hope not.

58:18.917 --> 58:21.292
Because a priori,
this is where we are going.

58:25.126 --> 58:26.792
Go, sleep, baby.

58:28.417 --> 58:30.292
Sleep, my little wonder.

58:38.209 --> 58:39.792
* -In Quantum universe

58:40.042 --> 58:43.501
* Things do not need
to stay in one place

58:44.376 --> 58:46.751
* Or follow one direction.

58:51.709 --> 58:54.501
* You can be more
places at once.

58:56.501 --> 58:58.001
* What are you doing here

58:58.876 --> 59:03.501
* Has repercussions elsewhere,
like the beating of butterfly wings.

59:20.251 --> 59:22.334
- We will not go live in Brazil?

59:22.501 --> 59:25.126
- What is the relationship?
- I know you have spoken in

59:25.334 --> 59:26.667
with Jade.

59:26.834 --> 59:28.209
- We end our thing.

59:28.417 --> 59:29.584
We talk later?

59:33.876 --> 59:34.709
- It's not terrible

59:34.917 --> 59:37.459
we look
each program?

59:38.084 --> 59:39.376
- No. Why?

59:39.542 --> 59:42.751
- It's scary, I think.
- What is freedom, that.

59:43.001 --> 59:45.251
The freedom of those who love.

01:00:14.334 --> 01:00:42.834
...

01:00:43.126 --> 01:00:44.501
- Mr. Solal?

01:01:00.792 --> 01:02:00.376
...

01:02:00.876 --> 01:02:02.376
- It rhymes with Casper.

01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:06.459
- What?
- The bitter orange.

01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:33.417
...

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:42.042
- Yes.

01:02:42.209 --> 01:02:43.084
- Hold.

01:03:08.126 --> 01:03:09.042
- Thank you.

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:17.751
- I know not your ...

01:03:18.126 --> 01:03:18.917
- Hey!

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.167
- What time do you finish?

01:03:43.334 --> 01:03:46.626
I guess you're here too
to work.

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:48.876
- No. I'm here for that.

01:03:49.084 --> 01:03:51.834
- No longer. See?
No longer.

01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:55.584
So I finished in 18 hours.
I'll pick you up.

01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:57.501
And ...
- And ...?

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.167
- I'm taking you
in my carriage.

01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:04.292
- Yes.

01:04:04.459 --> 01:04:05.792
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:04:13.292 --> 01:04:17.042
Legal meeting in English.

01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:26.251
...

01:04:26.417 --> 01:04:27.792
- OK, OK.

01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:48.334
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:51.501
You are French, I see.
Excuse me.

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:52.542
Hello?

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:54.334
Yes, Lily. It's okay?

01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:59.584
Yes. I'll find it, your dress.
There, I work.

01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:03.334
I'm not here
shopping.

01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:06.209
I told you I would.
I still have to ...

01:05:07.126 --> 01:05:08.376
...

01:05:19.126 --> 01:07:24.417
...

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:28.751
- Beautiful.

01:07:29.126 --> 01:07:30.334
- Very nice.

01:07:33.459 --> 01:08:50.334
...

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.626
A knock at the door.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:58.042
...

01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:06.584
- Beautiful.

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:08.001
- Very nice.

01:09:09.126 --> 01:09:10.209
Between.

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:17.876
- Alert all units

01:09:18.084 --> 01:09:21.459
Pierre returned Solal
in my room.

01:09:21.584 --> 01:09:23.917
Pierre Solal
is in my room.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:29.334
- Pierre Solal entered the room
Elsa Santorini ...

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:33.501
He took her in his arms ...

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:37.376
because he is dying.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.917
- I feel
to be in Amma's arms.

01:09:51.126 --> 01:09:52.501
- Who is Amma?

01:09:53.334 --> 01:09:54.542
- Amma is ...

01:09:56.376 --> 01:09:59.001
It is this Indian
who makes big hugs.

01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:03.334
People come from all over the world
to be in his arms.

01:10:06.376 --> 01:10:10.792
Like this ...
- You ordered champagne?

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.042
- Gift of the hotel.

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:17.917
- It is opened? Too cliche?

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:20.667
I love clichés.

01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:26.792
- It's scary.

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:28.251
- To toast?

01:10:28.876 --> 01:10:30.001
- Yes.

01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:33.792
- Very.

01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:42.042
He sings "For once in my life"
Stevie Wonder.

01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:46.334
...

01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:08.251
- You're crazy.

01:11:13.584 --> 01:12:20.584
...

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:28.667
It's very intimate,
walking barefoot

01:12:28.834 --> 01:12:31.501
next to a man
we know very little.

01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:35.834
- We spent the evening to tell
we were married for 18 years.

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:50.792
- Not even you hesitate?
- No.

01:12:51.042 --> 01:13:08.251
...

01:13:11.376 --> 01:13:14.709
Ringing of the phone.

01:13:14.876 --> 01:13:21.501
...

01:13:25.584 --> 01:13:27.084
Phone ringtone.

01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:30.292
- It must be my daughter.
I must answer.

01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:34.917
...

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:37.126
Hello?

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:42.042
Hello?

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:43.542
Lily?

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.542
What happen?

01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:47.126
No, but ...

01:13:47.292 --> 01:13:50.334
You saw what time it is?
It will not?

01:13:50.501 --> 01:14:08.626
...

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:13.084
Peter?

01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:43.417
...

01:14:46.501 --> 01:14:49.251
- For a story
never stops,

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:51.792
must not
it begins.

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:02.001
- Elsa, journalist
West of France ...

01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:03.751
- Elsa?

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:06.001
- Congratulations for your book.

01:15:06.209 --> 01:15:08.501
- What is
your room number?

01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:10.001
- This is your work

01:15:10.209 --> 01:15:11.084
the more personal.

01:15:11.251 --> 01:15:13.917
- For me,
is Lacan meets Coluche.

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:15.917
- I want to believe you.

01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:17.501
Think before you post it, I hope.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.626
- This is a card.
- Huh?

01:15:20.834 --> 01:15:22.292
- There he is. Peter?

01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:24.209
- Bravo, Elsa.

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:27.417
- Elsa, I present to you Peter.
- Pleased. Eisa.

01:15:27.834 --> 01:15:30.792
- Yes, I know.
Delighted too.

01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:33.376
- Between pot smokers,

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:37.376
you will hear you.
- I hope I have other qualities.

01:15:37.542 --> 01:15:39.917
- This one is fine with me.

01:15:40.126 --> 01:15:43.126
The guy is West France.
- Ah yes.
