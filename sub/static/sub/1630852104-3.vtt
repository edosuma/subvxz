WEBVTT

00:40.916 --> 00:41.916
Go on.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.833


00:44.916 --> 00:45.916
A curl?

01:12.291 --> 01:14.125
Didn't you get to bed last night, Glyn?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.916
Sorry. You just look this morning
like you didn't go at all.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.208


01:18.291 --> 01:21.208
- Have you heard the "Octopus" one?
- No.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.291
You learned A minor, then?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.208
That's all I've got.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.625
After the two times, the second time…

01:55.708 --> 01:57.583


02:05.083 --> 02:08.208
Then to get to the G one, a bit, uh…

02:08.291 --> 02:10.458
Let's go from the beginning.

02:10.541 --> 02:11.833
- From the beginning.
- Right.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.416


02:30.416 --> 02:31.791
Then stay on F.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.291
Then that, then this, uh…

02:35.375 --> 02:36.375
What one's that?

02:37.916 --> 02:39.583
Uh--

02:59.166 --> 03:02.083
Just, I mean, something
to sort of get back to where you--

03:02.166 --> 03:03.166
Where we started.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.333
- It's a little bit--

03:35.625 --> 03:37.250
- So it resolves itself.
- Yeah.

03:37.958 --> 03:40.041
Well, I'll have to put words
in that bit, then.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.625
- Oh, drums, right.

04:04.708 --> 04:08.458
I think Paul would wanna do drums,
wouldn't he? With his strong left arm.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.625
I'm not getting on that kit
without a ciggy.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.041
I've never been up here before.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.625
Very strong one.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.750
- Okay!

04:37.041 --> 04:40.458
- I'm a tame tiger. Meow.
- I'm cool with that.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.333
- Are you going to eat them?
- No!

04:46.416 --> 04:47.916
Lots of people do, you know.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.333
On toast?

04:52.416 --> 04:54.833
You put pastry around them,
and you have cat pie.

04:57.416 --> 04:59.583
You better wait a week or two
before you eat them.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.625
- That's very good.
- We'll put on the meat.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.416
Oh, you don't eat them
if they have black spots.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.208
You don't eat them
if they're like tigers, either.

05:17.666 --> 05:22.083
And anyway,
I'm just a pussycat that was just born.

05:52.416 --> 05:57.041


06:10.416 --> 06:11.458
Kevin?

06:11.541 --> 06:14.416
What was the… Do that old gospel ending.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.333
- Sunday morning. Sunday morning. Church.
- Sunday morning. Definitely, yeah.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.750
- And we'll all kneel as we do it.
- We can do a gospel ending that Elvis did.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.250
Yeah.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.916
We all was gonna do it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.166
- We did it just fine. It was just that…
- Yeah.

06:58.875 --> 07:00.000
I'll tell you one thing.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.458
Do it lighter. Don't do sort of--

07:04.666 --> 07:06.541
Do it more--

07:08.791 --> 07:10.916
And so a bit lighter offbeat, and maybe…

07:20.625 --> 07:23.458
Keep it light.
So it's not going heavy again.

07:32.541 --> 07:35.041
I don't know what you are saying.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.250
Uh…

07:37.333 --> 07:38.833
Hello.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.333
Is anybody…

07:41.416 --> 07:44.333
Let me sing. Hello. Is anybody home?

08:15.750 --> 08:18.083


08:23.166 --> 08:24.458
Hi.

08:24.541 --> 08:26.333
- Aah!

08:33.750 --> 08:34.833
Yoko!

09:09.916 --> 09:12.291


09:12.375 --> 09:14.375


09:57.125 --> 09:59.000


09:59.083 --> 10:01.208


10:02.083 --> 10:03.833


10:42.083 --> 10:43.583
Yeah!

10:48.291 --> 10:49.291
Oh, sorry.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.791
Come on, let it be.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.125
What ones haven't you done yet?

11:01.208 --> 11:03.083
A little thing that goes
something like this.

11:15.875 --> 11:20.291


11:51.125 --> 11:55.041


12:32.958 --> 12:35.375


12:39.791 --> 12:40.916
- No. No.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.125
No, see,
you've gotta wait a lot longer than that.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.708
- You done left me.
- You done left me.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.708
There wouldn't be much drumming,
would there?

14:11.125 --> 14:12.708
Go around a bit, you know?

14:12.791 --> 14:13.791
What?

14:14.333 --> 14:16.708
It sounds a bit like
a sort of dance orchestra.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.750
And the slow foxtrot…

14:19.833 --> 14:22.250
Like Rita and Thomas Williams.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.625
Rita is wearing a dark sombrero
and a beard.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.208
The chord there. I mean--

14:30.750 --> 14:33.708
Her husband is wearing
a crinoline skirt which he made himself.

14:52.416 --> 14:53.916
Still no idea where I come in.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.791
- Off the top of your head.
- John, yours doesn't sound as much…

14:57.375 --> 14:59.041
It sounds like
you're doing too many notes.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.875
- Yeah, all right. Well, it just gets--
- It's too, sort of, regular.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.791
But you're doing…

15:11.375 --> 15:12.583
I've been going…

15:13.958 --> 15:15.750
- You just want the one?
- Don't do that.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.250
No, but I mean, don't do any note there.
Just go…

15:25.208 --> 15:27.125
That's what I'm really doing.
I've been going--

15:30.833 --> 15:31.833
Hello?

15:38.250 --> 15:39.250
Great!

15:53.041 --> 15:54.416
Amazing.

16:30.875 --> 16:31.875
Okay.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.041
One.

16:51.291 --> 16:55.291


17:17.750 --> 17:21.125
When it's mixed, as it is, I'm sure
with a mix on it, it'll be all right.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.333
I know what--

17:32.458 --> 17:34.416
Paul, are you gonna have strings?

17:41.833 --> 17:43.416
- Yeah.
- Well, it's like--

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
Ooh!

17:44.583 --> 17:45.583
Yeah, there's parts--

17:45.666 --> 17:48.791
There's only parts where
you can hear the electric piano properly,

17:48.875 --> 17:50.583
- or the piano properly.
- Yes.

17:50.666 --> 17:53.458
Most of the time, you know,
like, they mix together.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.916
Yeah. I think it needs,
like, a lot of, uh…

18:02.000 --> 18:03.875
- Cleaning.
- Cleaning, yeah.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.416
Actually,
the thing is, it's a nice feel to it,

18:07.500 --> 18:09.416
but it's rather like
everything else we've done.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.041
And this particular song
doesn't need that.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.250
See, the only way I've ever heard it is,
like, in my head,

18:16.333 --> 18:19.166
- is, like, Ray Charles's band.
- I'm supposed to marry you.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.291
And I don't--
I haven't really even listened to them.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.625
It would be nice with some brass
just doing the sustaining chord thing.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.708
- Yeah.

18:27.791 --> 18:31.375
- Yeah.
- Moving and just holding notes.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.916
- Yeah. We probably, yeah--
- If I pull yours up…

18:36.000 --> 18:38.791
We were planning to do it anyway
for a couple of numbers,

18:38.875 --> 18:41.041
just to have
a bit of brass and bit of strings.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.583
That's what George was saying before.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.541
That's the bit
where The Raelettes'd sing it.

18:44.625 --> 18:49.000


18:56.166 --> 18:59.041
Great. Sorry, man. Oh, that's nice.

18:59.541 --> 19:01.125
That's nice of what?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.375
It's nice of you.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.875
- For what?
- Very nice of you.

19:04.958 --> 19:06.958
- For what?
- Just to come here.

19:07.875 --> 19:08.875
We're going home.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.458
- When?
- Now.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
No.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.166
Am I gonna eat now? I'm going back.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.958
She's so worried now.
"I gotta eat for three hours,

19:18.541 --> 19:20.458
then maybe go to bed around 1:00."

19:21.833 --> 19:24.375
You're just going back in your box.
That's where you're going.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.666
- Don't tell. Don't tell.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.041
Aren't I gonna have anything to eat?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.041
Hey, I've got a present for you.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.375
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

19:33.458 --> 19:36.000
- Aren't you going, George?
- I said yes, George.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.708


19:44.291 --> 19:48.750


20:22.000 --> 20:25.500


20:36.375 --> 20:38.625


20:39.333 --> 20:44.083


21:19.666 --> 21:21.333
I don't know.
You didn't get the other one?

21:21.416 --> 21:22.416
- No.
- No.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.666
- Well, we'll remember that another day.
- Yeah.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.000
I'm just so high when I get in at night.

21:28.458 --> 21:29.458
I couldn't sleep.

21:38.875 --> 21:39.958
Tea or toast.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.000
- Yeah.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.500
What's this chord, Billy? E with a C?

22:05.583 --> 22:07.500
Yeah. Just loading the E.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.625
- Yeah. That's like E7.
- Yeah.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.208
This one.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.416
- Yeah. Um, E with a raised…

22:15.958 --> 22:17.833
E with a C. E.

22:18.583 --> 22:21.375
- Yeah, E with a C.
- E with a C. What's that?

22:23.708 --> 22:26.208
I've had an E with an F,
which is pretty good.

22:41.916 --> 22:44.083


22:44.166 --> 22:47.583


23:05.750 --> 23:07.250
What's this chord then, Billy?

23:09.958 --> 23:14.250
- It's F, but raising the F to F sharp.
- Yeah. F sharp. Diminished.

23:14.333 --> 23:17.500
And then F with that, like the 7th.

23:18.708 --> 23:21.291
It's great on piano
'cause I don't know anything about it.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.208
Yeah.

23:22.291 --> 23:25.750
But it's great, because I wouldn't have
been able to do that on the guitar.

24:15.875 --> 24:19.166
- Yeah, sorry, that bit comes…
- It does work, the bit--

24:19.250 --> 24:20.875
- But it--
- In the bit before that bit.

24:20.958 --> 24:24.958
Yeah, but then it's, uh--
Then it stays too long on the other one.

24:25.041 --> 24:29.041
- But it's like a natural on there.
- Yeah. Well, you don't know…

25:02.166 --> 25:05.000
- Pianos are very difficult, aren't they?

25:16.125 --> 25:18.041
- Mal? Mal?

25:18.125 --> 25:19.750
The drums are on PA anyway.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.458
When we connect it, I could hear Ringo.

25:21.541 --> 25:23.041
The drums are on PA!

25:23.541 --> 25:26.166
- It's not my idea of a personal assistant.
- No.

25:50.791 --> 25:51.791
Hello? Hello?

25:54.583 --> 25:56.166
'Cause coming from the north of England,

25:56.250 --> 25:58.541
it doesn't come too easy, you know,
all the soul.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.166
- Let's take one now.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.333
Yeah, right.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.875
Ask 'em to put the mics on, will you?

26:05.958 --> 26:07.375
Hello.

26:07.458 --> 26:08.958
And get one for Billy too.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.541
- It's a bit ploddy.
- What?

26:18.500 --> 26:21.958
You know, just--
It sort of plods along a bit. A bit much.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.375
- It's just mourning and slow, slow.
- Mourning and…

26:25.458 --> 26:28.750
And a slow song.
It takes a long time to get out of it.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.375
Yeah.
That'll do for the time being.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.458
"The Wrong and Winding Box."

26:57.958 --> 27:00.416
All those little melodic things, you know?

27:00.500 --> 27:01.916
It's a-- It's a--

27:02.750 --> 27:05.833
It's like the other one, you know.
They're sort of slow, ballady,

27:05.916 --> 27:07.708
and they're plodding a bit.

27:16.375 --> 27:19.708
See, that's the kind of thing. Yeah.
It needs to go like that.

27:32.416 --> 27:33.541
Oh, just a second.

27:33.625 --> 27:36.416
When it goes, um-- On that bit, it goes…

27:38.125 --> 27:39.250
Hang on.

27:40.041 --> 27:42.166
Can we make the bridge…

27:43.333 --> 27:44.333
heavy?

27:45.833 --> 27:48.541
I can't sort of think how to do
this one at all, you know.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.458
Just, mind's a blank on it.

27:50.541 --> 27:51.666
I don't know.

27:52.833 --> 27:54.250
I don't know.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.083
Give up.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.291
It's nice though.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.541
- Have you turned me down?
- No.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.458
It's funny though.
You can't hear the piano either.

28:13.416 --> 28:15.083
We only asked for the piano.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.166
No. I said, "Oh, Ringo is on PA."

28:25.291 --> 28:29.000
A great sound in here
will improve what we do.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.125
No, but I mean, it's like
when we played in clubs in Hamburg.

28:34.416 --> 28:35.833
We sounded great.

28:45.541 --> 28:46.541
So you get…

28:53.583 --> 28:55.666
Let's do that.
It'll help you anyway to begin with.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.291
- Thank you, George.
- You're welcome.

28:57.833 --> 29:00.416
See, 'cause that'd be good
if we could get all that,

29:01.083 --> 29:03.083
get the sound in this room.

29:03.166 --> 29:06.166
It's, like, remember that night
we tried tape echo with George?

29:06.250 --> 29:07.500
On a bit of vocal.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.583
They have bloody big speakers
or something,

29:31.166 --> 29:32.375
to shout through.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.375
They should be
at least as big as a bass amp.

29:35.458 --> 29:36.458
- Yeah.
- Paul.

29:36.541 --> 29:37.708
Yeah.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.541
Thing is, they're both facing
each other for a kickoff.

29:43.625 --> 29:46.375
They're all facing--
They're all right next to the amps.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.333
I mean, get them up there,
they come down to us.

29:55.416 --> 29:58.625
Nail 'em on them sticks up there
and shoot 'em down to us,

29:58.708 --> 30:02.125
and we'll all face that way if you like.
We'll face any way.

30:02.958 --> 30:05.583
Well, then, let's--
I don't know who to tell to do that.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.375
Right, okay.
Yeah. I'll do something about it.

30:07.458 --> 30:09.875
Somehow if we can each hear
what the others are playing.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.666


30:15.750 --> 30:20.833


30:23.083 --> 30:25.875
-

30:43.583 --> 30:44.583
- Uh…
- Ow!

30:45.166 --> 30:48.416
Just heard that Yoko's divorce
has just gone through.

30:49.916 --> 30:50.916
Free at last.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.500
Did we… "And if"?

31:31.583 --> 31:32.583
Start again.

31:38.208 --> 31:41.291
I've just got written down here,
"If somebody ever loved me."

31:41.375 --> 31:45.291
Oh, I've got, "If somebody
ever really loved me, like as she do me."

31:45.375 --> 31:46.375
Ah.

31:49.916 --> 31:53.041
Maybe we should have,
"I guess nobody ever loved me."

32:01.666 --> 32:03.166


32:04.750 --> 32:06.166


32:50.916 --> 32:52.875
George. George. George.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.416
The layout of the book's
really good, though, the way he's done it.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.541
This is it. Is this the layout?

33:31.625 --> 33:33.291
No, this is just the bit. That bit.

33:33.958 --> 33:38.708
"Beatle John Lennon hugged Japanese
actress Yoko Ono last night and said,

33:38.791 --> 33:41.416
'My marriage is over.
I am in love with Yoko.'"

33:41.500 --> 33:43.666
- Sinceriously.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.166
"How much does he love Yoko?
'Much more than I love the Queen.'"

34:17.791 --> 34:21.041


34:22.458 --> 34:25.666


34:27.375 --> 34:30.125
Let's record it all this afternoon, now.

34:31.291 --> 34:34.708
The show on Wednesday,
which is up on the roof, we can get, uh,

34:34.791 --> 34:37.666
no worse than a 4-shot on the roof
out toward London,

34:38.291 --> 34:40.708
- which I think is worth it.
- Yes. How much does it cost?

34:42.500 --> 34:44.750
Well, just send the helicopter up.
No film.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.041
- It's too much, film and a…
- Helicopter.

34:48.125 --> 34:49.541
Uh, what do you say, lads?

34:49.625 --> 34:51.000
- Have it on Paul!
- Yeah.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.375
- Yeah.
- Yes.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.833
- Is that a yes?
- That's a no-no.

35:00.125 --> 35:02.333
One, two, three, four.

35:18.208 --> 35:21.208
Not too loud though.
It's nice, quiet. Oh, yeah.

35:21.291 --> 35:25.083
It settled into it, though, after where
we started in, but much, much faster.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.500
One, two, three, four.

35:36.958 --> 35:38.833
Bit faster, do you think? Bit faster now.

35:39.541 --> 35:41.375
One, two, three, four.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.500
Hello.

35:49.041 --> 35:52.333


35:52.416 --> 35:55.250


36:00.208 --> 36:02.541
- Little bit slower.
- It seems it's picking up speed, I think.

36:02.625 --> 36:03.625
Yeah.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.833
'Cause I find myself starting off, going…

36:05.916 --> 36:06.916
We get excited.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.083
And then ended up…

36:15.833 --> 36:18.708
Ah, this here's the story
about Sweet Loretta Martin

36:19.458 --> 36:20.958
and Jo Jo McCartney.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.250
All right, boy. All right, John.
I've gotta call order, John.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.166
- All right, Paul.
- You know, valuable time here, son.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.291
Cool down, son.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.916
Don't let me down, babe.

36:58.500 --> 37:03.250


37:10.208 --> 37:13.166
- They can afford it.
- Costing EMI. We're EMI artists, man, no?

37:31.916 --> 37:34.458
- …together at the beginning.
- You were very good, Bill.

37:39.583 --> 37:40.708
What are you gonna do?

37:40.791 --> 37:42.500
- Play it again.
- Sing a bit.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.958
- J?
- Just keep 'em. Keep 'em.

37:45.041 --> 37:46.583
- Do another one?
- Yeah.

37:46.666 --> 37:48.916
Well, tell us if you think
we've got it, you know?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.208
Well, yeah.

37:50.291 --> 37:52.000
Let's keep doing them then, you know?

37:52.083 --> 37:54.416
'Cause if we keep doing that
and going in and then saying, "Oh."

37:54.500 --> 37:57.000
I think you ought to do
something else, 'cause I think you might--

37:57.083 --> 37:58.791
If you keep doing it,
you'll go stale on it.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.708
- No, no. Let's do it.
- You can always go back to it.

38:00.791 --> 38:03.041
- Do you want your head kicked in?
- You know what I mean, though.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.875
- Do you wanna do it once more then?
- Yes, yes.

38:06.958 --> 38:10.125
At least once more.
We'll never get a chance to do it again.

38:10.208 --> 38:13.375
It is the final
performance. You've got an audience now.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.458
Okay, honeybunch.
Let's hit it one time, tutti-frutti.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.500
One, two…

38:27.250 --> 38:29.083
That last take was extremely good though.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.250
Okay. Keep it extremely good then.
We'll carry on.

38:41.666 --> 38:43.583
Why not go straight into
another number then?

38:43.666 --> 38:46.083
We were trying to go into
"Don't Let Me Down" if we made it,

38:46.166 --> 38:48.166
but we haven't made it once yet, you know?

38:48.250 --> 38:51.750
We think of everything and we're
even gonna go on to "I've Got a Fever."

38:51.833 --> 38:53.166
If we really know.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.041
In that case,
I'm gonna change tape.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.125
Are you? Okay.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.458
Was the other one before better than that?

39:13.708 --> 39:17.250
Yes. There was one better than that
earlier on. Hang on, we'll just…

39:17.333 --> 39:18.916
The one before this was better for me.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.333
Should we have another ciggy,
another cup of tea, or…

39:21.416 --> 39:23.083
- Okay, yeah after this.
- …ciggy after the wine.

39:23.166 --> 39:26.250
Oh, ready? One, two three, four.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.958
There's one where everything was right…

39:39.041 --> 39:41.166
- What's the next reel?
- …except the last bit of my guitar solo.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.666
Well, remember the one before that
that we all said was all right?

39:43.750 --> 39:45.208
- Yeah.
- That's Take 11.

39:45.291 --> 39:46.333
You can always edit.

39:46.416 --> 39:48.666
- Yeah, I'm just getting it.
- Edit?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.416
You're talking to the Bootles.

39:57.916 --> 40:01.083
Yeah, right. Now, see the thing is,
we need another week to do it.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.458


40:22.541 --> 40:25.291


40:49.916 --> 40:51.416
Miles out, aren't we?

40:51.500 --> 40:52.916
- Tune.
- Yeah.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.041
It was A, Bill.

40:54.125 --> 41:00.125
Billy, instead of giving us,
like, one note, give us a riff like…

41:01.833 --> 41:03.666
That's easier to tune to.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.125
- Hold up. Hold up.
- Okay. Let me just--

41:35.250 --> 41:38.333
Not giving 'em that!

41:38.416 --> 41:40.333
Oh, fucking right.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.458
Something happened.
I don't know what it was though.

41:47.083 --> 41:48.125
Something happened.

43:37.708 --> 43:40.166
Glyn? What does that sound like?

43:43.958 --> 43:45.000
- What?
- Yeah.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.125
- All right?
- Yeah.

44:02.083 --> 44:03.666
- Not bad.
- Got it.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.541
- Oh, the last two will do me.
- That's what I thought.

44:07.625 --> 44:10.083
- It was just about diabolical enough.
- You see, the thing is…

44:10.166 --> 44:13.500
I don't feel as though
I'm singing it any good.

44:13.583 --> 44:16.041
- The other day I was singing better.
- 'Cause you're standing up.

44:16.125 --> 44:18.083
- And you're trying to do a thing.
- Maybe.

44:18.166 --> 44:19.416
You should sit down.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.666
- Enjoy yourself.
- Yeah.

44:21.583 --> 44:25.083
Maybe. No, but even so today,
I just feel as though…

44:25.791 --> 44:26.916
Hobson's is a bit…

44:28.166 --> 44:29.166
That reel on?

44:29.250 --> 44:31.666
We've still got a lot more songs
we haven't even rehearsed.

44:32.541 --> 44:37.000
The two slow ones we're doing,
"Mother Mary" and… "Brother Jesus."

44:37.083 --> 44:38.708
- Have we recorded?

44:38.791 --> 44:40.583
Have we recorded the "Mother Mary" one?

44:40.666 --> 44:41.916
Haven't happened yet, have they?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
- No.
- Haven't they?

44:43.083 --> 44:44.583
- One has. One has.
- Well…

44:44.666 --> 44:46.375
- Which one?
- I can never get it.

44:46.458 --> 44:48.000
- "Long, Long, Winding"--
- "Long and Winding Road"?

44:48.083 --> 44:49.166
"Long and Winding Scrotum."

44:49.250 --> 44:51.416
- Really?
- I think it's very tasty.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.583
<i>Très</i> tasty, in fact.

44:52.666 --> 44:54.000
Oh, the little version we had--

44:54.083 --> 44:56.083
- He's so good for your morale, this boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:56.166 --> 44:57.583
- No, really.

44:57.666 --> 44:59.916
- We can do--
- I'm not saying you can't do it better.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.458
But, I mean, it's very together.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.833
See, that's a bit like the old "Get Back."

45:04.916 --> 45:07.166
It's together
until you think you can do it better.

45:08.041 --> 45:10.250
We should arrange what's happening
around lunchtime tomorrow.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.500
John's got something at 1:30,
and so have I.

45:12.583 --> 45:15.458
I'll take these tonight.
You can have a mix of these tomorrow.

45:16.208 --> 45:18.166
- I'm meeting a fella.
- Oh, right.

45:19.375 --> 45:23.250
No, uh, at 1:30 though.
We're both going at 1:30, so can you…

45:23.333 --> 45:26.833
We'll do something, all right.
I'll do Ringo at 1:30.

45:26.916 --> 45:29.333
- Let's say 12:00.

45:29.416 --> 45:31.916
We'll be coming in before 1:30?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
- Yeah. Coming in at 11:00.
- Okay.

45:34.083 --> 45:35.083
Then work till 1:30.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.875
<i>Okay, honeybunch. Let's hit it one time.</i>

45:36.958 --> 45:39.041
- What time are you starting?
- 11:00.

45:39.625 --> 45:41.208
- 11:00 to 1:30?
- 10:30, yeah.

45:41.291 --> 45:42.625
<i>Dig, man.</i>

45:42.708 --> 45:44.958
And then how long
are you having off from 1:30?

45:45.041 --> 45:47.291
Till 3:00. Good night, everybody.

45:47.375 --> 45:49.416
- Good night, Rich.
- Good night, Richie.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.375
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Will you?

45:51.458 --> 45:53.333
I think the one you said was best…

45:53.416 --> 45:54.666
- Nine?
- …is best.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.833
Yeah. But it still doesn't make it.

45:57.708 --> 45:59.708
- We'll keep it anyway.
- Keep it in.

46:03.291 --> 46:04.500
- Good?
- Yeah.

46:04.583 --> 46:08.583
- Right. New reel.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.541
Well, the air-conditioning works.

46:11.541 --> 46:14.125
- God, feel like I'm in the army.
- It must be terrible.

46:14.208 --> 46:16.416
That was the only good thing
about being a girl.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.416
Can you imagine being drafted to Vietnam?

46:18.500 --> 46:20.583
George,
of the ones they've done so far,

46:20.666 --> 46:22.791
which do you think we can do on the roof?

46:22.875 --> 46:24.791
- Anything without the grand piano.
- Oh!

46:25.791 --> 46:27.791
- Morning.
- You're embarrassing me.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.833
Should we write down
what we could do on the roof?

46:34.375 --> 46:36.750
You haven't got
a concise list of titles, have we, Alan?

46:36.833 --> 46:39.000
- No. I can make one.
- Well, I…

46:39.083 --> 46:41.000
One is "I Dig a Pony."
We can do that on the roof.

46:41.083 --> 46:42.083
"Let It Be."

46:42.666 --> 46:45.833
Which is "Let It Be"? Oh, no.
I think "Let It Be" should be down here.

46:46.708 --> 46:48.208
Yeah, with the piano on that.

46:50.166 --> 46:52.875
Is anyone sort of
thinking of this like making an album

46:52.958 --> 46:55.333
or more like sort of
doing a lot of numbers then

46:55.416 --> 46:59.083
to be able to play them all
one after the other?

46:59.166 --> 47:00.208
Let's pick the five--

47:06.125 --> 47:07.166
Uh…

47:08.250 --> 47:09.750
I don't see much point in doing

47:09.833 --> 47:12.083
"Don't Let Me Down,"
"I've Got A Feeling" and that now.

47:13.083 --> 47:14.291
Yeah…

47:14.375 --> 47:16.083
'Cause you lose it.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.666
So let's pick up on the ones
that are all in pieces.

47:19.666 --> 47:22.666
I'm trying to get us to do
one of George's for the first batch.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.500
Oh, ah. Yeah.

47:34.166 --> 47:36.875
Then you can have the next one,
"Did you know, missed the show?"

47:53.625 --> 47:57.875


48:00.541 --> 48:04.458


48:12.291 --> 48:13.833
What could it be, Paul?

48:13.916 --> 48:15.750
- "Something in the way she moves."
- Hmm?

48:15.833 --> 48:17.250
What attracted me at all?

48:17.333 --> 48:19.541
Just say whatever comes
into your head each time.

48:19.625 --> 48:22.875
"Attracts me like a cauliflower,"
until you get the word, you know?

48:22.958 --> 48:26.291
Yeah, but I've been through this one,
like, for about six months.

48:31.750 --> 48:34.666
We could have that.
"Attracts me like a pomegranate."

48:46.208 --> 48:47.500
"Cauliflower" is better.

49:28.458 --> 49:30.166
- Okay.
- What was that?

49:30.250 --> 49:33.041
Yeah, but say we got
a really good one of "Love Me Do."

49:33.125 --> 49:36.041
- Well, yeah. That's true.
- Yeah. Okay.

49:47.166 --> 49:50.000


49:50.958 --> 49:55.708


49:58.791 --> 50:02.875
Is it 1:30? I've got this--
to go to this meeting.

50:02.958 --> 50:03.958
So, can you do it?

50:04.625 --> 50:07.291
Will you ring down for us?
And we'll keep going through this.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.041
Yeah. Okay.

50:25.416 --> 50:26.583
Shall we do it?

50:35.541 --> 50:37.708
- Glyn?
- Send an engineer.

50:37.791 --> 50:38.791
Glyn.

50:40.458 --> 50:43.666
Can you come and fix my microphone?
It keeps falling down.

50:58.416 --> 51:00.208
See, can I change from going…

51:02.708 --> 51:05.208
Because I can't do it.
I go into that folk bit.

51:05.291 --> 51:06.375
Have a ciggy, Billy.

51:24.541 --> 51:25.875
Two, three, four.

51:51.375 --> 51:54.333
I'll sing it a bit different than that.
I'll sing…

51:57.791 --> 51:58.791
- All that bit.
- Yeah.

51:58.875 --> 52:00.458
Okay.
Should we go from the last verse again?

52:00.541 --> 52:02.041
That's the bit still, isn't it?

52:02.125 --> 52:03.125
I still think that--

52:03.208 --> 52:05.791
I'm not sure about that syncopation bit,
but leave that to Paul.

52:05.875 --> 52:10.416
Well, that's okay if we just do it
in between, you know, where the riff…

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
Uh…

52:12.333 --> 52:14.291
It seems to be going
through every verse now.

52:14.375 --> 52:16.375
Yeah, that's the riff. Goes…

52:17.000 --> 52:18.750
- I mean that…
- It should change.

52:18.833 --> 52:20.500
No, that just comes at the end.

52:21.583 --> 52:23.208
Oh, in the middle of every verse?

52:36.208 --> 52:40.875
But also we need somebody that's gonna
tune everything in here to one pitch.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.500
Uh, the piano people do that.

52:42.583 --> 52:44.791
Okay, well,
we'll play about for a bit then.

52:44.875 --> 52:47.166
- How do you tune an electric piano?
- I don't know.

52:49.083 --> 52:51.500
There's got to be a way though.
Probably here somewhere.

52:53.291 --> 52:54.708
What did you wanna talk about?

52:54.791 --> 52:56.916
Uh, well,
just that I saw Klein, and that.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.666
- Oh, Klein?
- Yeah, yeah. Klein.

52:58.750 --> 53:00.083
- Allen Klein.
- Oh, I see.

53:00.166 --> 53:02.166
Yeah. And it's--
You know, it's very interesting.

53:02.250 --> 53:03.250
Yeah.

53:03.333 --> 53:05.458
- You know, from a lot of angles.
- Hmm.

53:05.541 --> 53:09.375
And the-- But I want to tell you
all at once, you know, so as it's not…

53:10.666 --> 53:14.083
But just, um--
I just think he's fantastic.

53:14.166 --> 53:15.583
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:16.833 --> 53:19.833
A lot of interesting news
that we don't know half about,

53:19.916 --> 53:21.291
- just about--
- About us?

53:21.375 --> 53:24.708
Well, I'll tell-- You know,
he'll tell you all that, 'cause it's…

53:24.791 --> 53:26.791
You know,
he knows everything about everything.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.000
Very interesting guy.

53:28.083 --> 53:30.791
- I was there till 2:00 in the morning.
- Oh, you went last night?

53:30.875 --> 53:34.125
I went there thinking, "Well, I've got
to see him. I put it off last time."

53:34.208 --> 53:35.458
You know?

53:35.541 --> 53:37.416
I keep hearing about him all these years.

53:37.500 --> 53:40.375
Things that you just…
you can't believe, you know.

53:40.458 --> 53:44.125
Right down to where-- where it's gone,

53:45.500 --> 53:46.666
and how to get it.

53:47.958 --> 53:51.666
So, I, you know-- Well, I didn't
really wanna say it to sort of half o'ya.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.416
I thought,
"He's gonna look after me, whatever."

53:54.500 --> 53:56.041
That's… it's just like that.

53:58.083 --> 54:00.875
And he knows--
He even knows what we're like, you know?

54:00.958 --> 54:03.375
The way he described each one of us,
you know,

54:03.458 --> 54:05.833
and what we've done
and what we're gonna do and that.

54:05.916 --> 54:09.125
But just, like,
he knows me as much as you do.

54:10.791 --> 54:12.125
Incredible guy.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.875
He's got a great idea for Biafra.

54:14.958 --> 54:16.833
He's like--
He says, "I'm a practical man."

54:16.916 --> 54:19.875
And his thing--
You know The Stones' Circus we did?

54:19.958 --> 54:21.833
- So he arranges those things for them.
- Yeah.

54:21.916 --> 54:27.041
All we heard about that
and the-- the-- the royalty from way back…

54:27.125 --> 54:28.875
- Yeah.
- …they get much more than us.

54:28.958 --> 54:31.375
However many we sell, they cop.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.833
You know, so, The Stones show,
he's gonna make an LP out of it.

54:35.916 --> 54:38.166
They're making a book of it
and everything, of course, you know?

54:38.250 --> 54:39.916
Like, everybody is into that.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.083
And he's gonna, uh, make an LP of it,
of everybody that was on…

54:45.791 --> 54:48.541
to buy food for Biafra.

54:48.625 --> 54:50.625
Yeah, I was telling him
about your idea for that film.

54:50.708 --> 54:51.958
- Oh, yeah.
- The thing is,

54:52.041 --> 54:55.875
I mean, if we took the food to that place,
with the money we've all earned--

54:55.958 --> 54:57.958
He'd do it completely himself,
arrange it all.

54:58.041 --> 55:01.458
I didn't mean to get into all this,
but he's so fascinating.

55:04.791 --> 55:06.791
Do you want to do this one more time?

55:06.875 --> 55:08.250
- Yeah.
- Eh?

55:08.916 --> 55:11.916
'Cause I'd like to learn
"On the Road to Marrakesh" or something.

55:14.625 --> 55:15.791
Or "Mr. Mustard."

55:16.333 --> 55:18.791
Must do another number, I've decided.

55:31.625 --> 55:34.750
Mal, what was the name of that
shoe shop somebody said is in Bond Street?

55:34.833 --> 55:37.458
The good one.
Do you know a good shoe shop near?

55:37.541 --> 55:39.541
There's a lot of shoe shops
in Bond Street.

55:39.625 --> 55:44.041
Yeah. But I just want, you know,
like ordinary black leather shoes.

55:44.625 --> 55:47.875
It's just that I never get any, you know,
'cause I'm never in shoe shops.

55:48.625 --> 55:50.458
Do you want me
to bring the bloke over?

55:50.541 --> 55:52.708
If you can con somebody into coming

55:52.791 --> 55:56.750
with, you know, a selection
of black slip-on size eights.

55:56.833 --> 55:57.875
Yeah, okay.

56:45.625 --> 56:47.875
- What?

56:47.958 --> 56:50.166
Where's it from? Who makes it?

56:50.250 --> 56:51.666
- Wow.
- Japanese?

56:51.750 --> 56:53.833
I saw it on the television.

56:56.166 --> 56:58.000
Too much! Whoo.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.208
Nice sound.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.541
- Could you transpose that to D?
- Yeah.

57:02.625 --> 57:05.916
- All on one note, huh?
- Yeah, you can change it.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
One at a time. It's a little organ.

57:15.541 --> 57:16.541
That's better.

57:17.083 --> 57:19.625
Yeah. It's too much, man.

57:53.916 --> 57:56.416
I love that song.
That's beautiful. I couldn't…

57:56.500 --> 57:57.500
You've won a prize.

57:57.583 --> 57:59.666
Couldn't have asked for
better. Can we have something else now?

57:59.750 --> 58:01.541
Another song, right. Okay, George?

58:02.208 --> 58:04.708
How about, uh…
What have you got up your sleeve, John?

58:05.916 --> 58:07.250
How about "Love Me Do" again?

58:07.333 --> 58:09.750
What about "Don't Let Me Down"?
That's a bloody good one, that.

58:09.833 --> 58:12.250
Very high though. But never mind.
We'll practice the backing.

58:12.333 --> 58:13.416
- What is it now?
- Just--

58:13.500 --> 58:16.083
"And if somebody ever loved me
like she does," that's all.

58:16.166 --> 58:17.416
Just the "really" out.

58:32.250 --> 58:33.250
Same guitar?

58:42.750 --> 58:44.166
Okay, George. Come on.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.375
One…

58:49.458 --> 58:50.958
The Krishna Christmas club.

58:53.583 --> 58:55.333
A little bit of a tune-up, I think.

58:55.416 --> 58:56.833
No, I don't think so, George.

58:56.916 --> 58:58.750
Yeah, John. Don't, John. Don't.

58:58.833 --> 59:01.208
I've had some wine, you know?
Remember Bob Wooler.

59:01.291 --> 59:03.000
Fucking right.

59:03.083 --> 59:04.166
Peace on Earth.

59:04.791 --> 59:07.583
"Don't Let Me Down the Road Again Blues."

59:07.666 --> 59:10.083
"Short, fat Fanny, you're my desire."

59:11.791 --> 59:14.041
One, two, three, four.

59:30.791 --> 59:34.125


59:56.458 --> 59:58.916


1:00:00.083 --> 1:00:01.333


1:00:16.416 --> 1:00:19.000


1:00:19.541 --> 1:00:21.583


1:01:26.291 --> 1:01:27.500
Allen Klein's here.

1:01:28.458 --> 1:01:29.916
Where's he gonna be?

1:01:30.708 --> 1:01:32.291
Should we go up to our room?

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:34.458
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck it.

1:01:46.125 --> 1:01:47.833
- Morning, Michael.
- Morning, R.S.

1:01:47.916 --> 1:01:51.000
How many numbers do you think
you'll have by tomorrow at 1:00

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:52.750
- before you go up on the roof?
- About six.

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:54.791
Yes, it's gonna be great.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:57.500


1:02:05.083 --> 1:02:06.083


1:02:27.625 --> 1:02:28.625
Yeah.

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:38.250
Yes.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:00.625
Mmm.

1:03:00.708 --> 1:03:03.958
Tomorrow, with the nine cameras,
if we do tomorrow,

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:05.958
there is a kind of,
"Something will happen."

1:03:06.041 --> 1:03:08.000
No, it's the best bit of us,

1:03:08.083 --> 1:03:09.875
always has been and always will be,

1:03:09.958 --> 1:03:12.875
is when we've got--
when we're backs against the wall

1:03:12.958 --> 1:03:14.916
and we've been rehearsing,
rehearsing, rehearsing.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.583
And he knows it's a take on the dub.
And he does it great.

1:03:17.666 --> 1:03:20.791
No, the organization
has gotta come from either you

1:03:20.875 --> 1:03:22.000
or from you doing an audience.

1:03:22.083 --> 1:03:24.708
But that's not true, you see?
There is a difference.

1:03:24.791 --> 1:03:27.375
- Like when we came here from Twickenham.
- Mmm.

1:03:27.458 --> 1:03:29.083
It's a whole other thing, you know?

1:03:30.041 --> 1:03:34.458
If we went into a TV studio now,
in one of those big, bare TV studios

1:03:34.541 --> 1:03:36.833
and you sat us down,
just with our songs and amps,

1:03:36.916 --> 1:03:38.500
we'd do 'em and we'd do 'em great.

1:03:39.541 --> 1:03:41.500
I think what we need is
an audience of some sort.

1:03:41.583 --> 1:03:43.083
Either a surprise audience--

1:03:43.666 --> 1:03:46.000
Tomorrow, or, uh… I'll light my cigar.

1:03:49.666 --> 1:03:50.666


1:03:52.791 --> 1:03:56.166
If we've got like everything set for
tomorrow, we just go ahead and do it and--

1:03:56.250 --> 1:03:58.416
The roof is like too far out.

1:03:58.500 --> 1:03:59.833
If we do an open air thing…

1:04:00.583 --> 1:04:03.208
That's-- that's really all
I can say about this whole scene.

1:04:03.291 --> 1:04:05.916
We should learn all the numbers.
All of them.

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.875
All the ones that are gonna be
on the album.

1:04:07.958 --> 1:04:09.791
I know it literally takes a bit more time.

1:04:09.875 --> 1:04:11.750
That's why I wanna
go through with you today, the ones--

1:04:11.833 --> 1:04:14.041
But we haven't got the end thing.

1:04:14.125 --> 1:04:17.000
I've got a feeling that
we're gonna just, sort of, go off…

1:04:19.166 --> 1:04:22.000
We're just gonna go off like we did
after the end of the last album.

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:25.375
And just sort of think,
"Oh, not another fucking album."

1:04:25.458 --> 1:04:27.791
You know? Because this is--
this is what this is, you know.

1:04:27.875 --> 1:04:30.333
- I can't wait to work it, you know?
- Yeah.

1:04:30.416 --> 1:04:33.833
But it's like we got much better takes
after we moved from Twickenham to here.

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:36.291
Oh, yeah,
but I mean here I like. It's like home.

1:04:36.375 --> 1:04:41.833
But, like, we still haven't got
any aim for it, except an album again.

1:04:41.916 --> 1:04:44.791
- Yeah.
- Our only aim ever is an album, you know?

1:04:44.875 --> 1:04:47.083
Which is like a very nonvisual thing.

1:04:47.166 --> 1:04:49.416
But albums is
what we're doing at the moment.

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:51.208
I mean,
you gotta be sneaky with The Beatles,

1:04:51.291 --> 1:04:53.916
or else we'll just go on forever
in a circle, you know?

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.750
Whenever we talk about it,
we have certain rules.

1:04:56.833 --> 1:05:00.291
Like George saying, "What do you
wanna do?" And he says, "No films."

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:02.958
You know, but it's wrong, that.
It's very wrong, that.

1:05:03.041 --> 1:05:04.708
Because you don't know.

1:05:04.791 --> 1:05:07.833
He says-- What he means is,
no <i>Help</i>, Hard Day's Night.

1:05:07.916 --> 1:05:10.375
'Cause this is a film.
And he now he doesn't mind this.

1:05:10.458 --> 1:05:12.416
It's us going silly again.

1:05:14.375 --> 1:05:16.833
See, it's like when we came
back from Hamburg,

1:05:16.916 --> 1:05:20.666
and did Leicester, De Montfort Hall
and we had the worst first night thing,

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:22.750
and we're all nervous,
and it was terrible.

1:05:22.833 --> 1:05:25.375
Then we played another the next night.
We just went right into it.

1:05:25.458 --> 1:05:28.000
We're good at that
once we get over the nervousness.

1:05:28.083 --> 1:05:31.625
But it's like there's the hurdle
of that nervousness is there now.

1:05:36.958 --> 1:05:40.125
Yes, but for who is
tomorrow the day? Not for me.

1:05:40.208 --> 1:05:42.000
You know, it's like there's this thing

1:05:42.083 --> 1:05:45.708
where there is a show to be had
out of what we've got here,

1:05:45.791 --> 1:05:48.791
which is just so incredible.
That's unbelievable.

1:05:48.875 --> 1:05:51.666
And you don't have to go on the roof.
You don't have to go anywhere.

1:05:51.750 --> 1:05:53.875
- You really only have to sing 'em.
- Well, even if we stay here--

1:05:53.958 --> 1:05:56.375
This business of
a deadline though is up to you really,

1:05:56.458 --> 1:05:58.083
because we've given you deadlines already.

1:05:58.166 --> 1:06:01.250
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm talking to John, not you.

1:06:02.541 --> 1:06:07.458
The easiest way to finish the show,
is just to sit here for another few days

1:06:07.541 --> 1:06:10.958
and start rehearsing them one after
the other and do three numbers at a time.

1:06:11.041 --> 1:06:13.708
And like George said, get a program
of where we're gonna do 'em,

1:06:13.791 --> 1:06:15.625
what's gonna follow what.

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:17.625
And just start playing them right through.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.416
And then just knock it off.

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:22.375
Like you used to, and have
all your titles on your guitar, you know.

1:06:22.458 --> 1:06:24.791
Yes, yes. I mean,
I thought that's what we're doing.

1:06:24.875 --> 1:06:26.333
It's just that
you say you're not ready.

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:27.791
We're not ready, yeah, sure.

1:06:27.875 --> 1:06:29.333
We're not ready to do 14.

1:06:29.416 --> 1:06:33.375
See, the only trouble is, we really have
to want to do a show at the end of it.

1:06:33.458 --> 1:06:35.250
That's the thing. That's the trouble.

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:37.208
None of us have an aim.

1:06:37.291 --> 1:06:39.750
We don't have a thing
at the end of it that we wanna do.

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:42.083
We could have had a De Montfort Hall show…

1:06:42.166 --> 1:06:43.708
This would have been De Montfort Hall

1:06:43.791 --> 1:06:46.666
if we'd have done
the dress rehearsal here.

1:06:46.750 --> 1:06:48.958
And get over the nervousness
of an audience,

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:52.291
and stop, sort of, playing to show off
to them and--

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.291
Just play it.

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:56.291
Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:56.375 --> 1:06:59.250
The voices are going in my head,
which way we're gonna-- which way we are--

1:06:59.333 --> 1:07:04.166
What's your, sort of, practical answer
to the problem now, regarding tomorrow?

1:07:07.541 --> 1:07:09.958
I think we'd be daft just not to do it--

1:07:10.041 --> 1:07:12.208
- Well, try and do something tomorrow…
- Sorry I'm late.

1:07:12.291 --> 1:07:16.416
…even if it's a grand dress rehearsal,
and see how it went.

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:18.750
- Morning, George.
- And then, you know…

1:07:19.708 --> 1:07:22.041
I mean, if we had another six weeks…

1:07:27.541 --> 1:07:29.458
Six weeks.

1:07:30.833 --> 1:07:33.833
I mean, you know,
if we had another month to play with

1:07:33.916 --> 1:07:39.500
to really, I think,
get 14 straight off, it'd be nice,

1:07:39.583 --> 1:07:41.625
you know, to still do the seven we've got.

1:07:42.541 --> 1:07:45.541
- Do you plan on playing the…
- What, what?

1:07:45.625 --> 1:07:48.750
I just don't-- You know, I think
it's gonna take months doing it like that.

1:07:49.916 --> 1:07:52.250
So how do you think we should do it then?

1:07:52.333 --> 1:07:54.625
You can film some
while we're recording them

1:07:54.708 --> 1:07:56.500
at the same time, okay, but--

1:07:56.583 --> 1:07:58.750
Yeah, see,
that's what I wanna get in me head.

1:07:58.833 --> 1:08:02.416
Is it a documentary of us
doing another album? Which it is.

1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:05.125
Except,
we're doing them one after the other.

1:08:05.208 --> 1:08:07.958
No, but, I mean, we're not doing a payoff.

1:08:08.041 --> 1:08:13.291
We're not doing the 11 numbers
straight off for an album.

1:08:13.375 --> 1:08:15.500
We're gonna have to, sort off, join 'em.

1:08:15.583 --> 1:08:18.208
I agree with that.
I think it's disappointing but, all right,

1:08:18.291 --> 1:08:20.666
we've only got to seven. Let's do seven.

1:08:23.416 --> 1:08:24.416
Yeah.

1:08:24.916 --> 1:08:27.375
'Cause otherwise--
We haven't enough time to do 14,

1:08:27.458 --> 1:08:29.458
'cause Ringo's gotta go, you know?

1:08:29.541 --> 1:08:32.833
But we might be able to get another seven
off by the end of two weeks.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:34.666
I mean, we will, but…

1:08:34.750 --> 1:08:37.250
The only trouble is that the only people,

1:08:37.333 --> 1:08:40.750
like, who need to agree on what it is
we're doing is the four of us,

1:08:40.833 --> 1:08:43.333
and we're the only ones
who haven't even talked about it.

1:08:43.416 --> 1:08:46.375
Because we had the meeting
before all this and said, "TV show."

1:08:46.458 --> 1:08:47.833
That's what I've gotta get in my head.

1:08:47.916 --> 1:08:49.208
It's an album.

1:08:49.291 --> 1:08:52.375
All that footage of film
which could make about half a dozen films.

1:08:52.458 --> 1:08:54.791
Yeah. It's a film of us making an album.

1:08:54.875 --> 1:08:56.458
Yeah, but that's visual.

1:08:56.541 --> 1:08:58.166
Yes. Yeah.

1:08:58.250 --> 1:09:01.583
Yeah. I've got no complaints about it.
But I just gotta get that in my head.

1:09:10.041 --> 1:09:13.333
This TV show was supposed
to be a TV show of the last album.

1:09:14.416 --> 1:09:15.708
- The last album?
- Yes.

1:09:15.791 --> 1:09:18.708
But when we came to do it we said,
"We'll write new songs."

1:09:18.791 --> 1:09:20.041
'Cause that's it, you see.
We always--

1:09:20.125 --> 1:09:22.291
We never--
We always get ahead of ourselves.

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:26.125
The thing is that, like, yesterday,
which wasn't a particularly good day,

1:09:26.208 --> 1:09:28.041
and the day before, which wasn't
a particularly good day either.

1:09:28.125 --> 1:09:29.125
Mmm.

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:31.208
The reason is obviously
the fact that you're playing

1:09:31.291 --> 1:09:34.708
the same three or four songs
for a week or whatever,

1:09:34.791 --> 1:09:36.083
you know,
and you're flogging them to death.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:37.708
Obviously you're getting bored
with them, you know, like,

1:09:37.791 --> 1:09:39.583
- it can't be any other way.
- Yeah.

1:09:39.666 --> 1:09:42.000
That was why George and I were trying
to get you yesterday

1:09:42.083 --> 1:09:45.541
to do three in one go,
straight through, so you had to think,

1:09:45.625 --> 1:09:48.000
"Oh, yeah, what's the key?
Why isn't it right?"

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:50.333
How many have we
already recorded good enough?

1:09:50.416 --> 1:09:51.416
None.

1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:55.458
None? Well, what about all those
times we've done "Get Back"?

1:09:55.541 --> 1:09:57.416
Oh, well, I mean,
one of them's all right, isn't it?

1:09:57.500 --> 1:09:59.333
There's that one of yours we did.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.291
And "Get Back."

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:04.291
But they're at a stage
where it's dress rehearsal stage,

1:10:04.375 --> 1:10:06.000
- Yes.
- Where if you did a performance,

1:10:06.083 --> 1:10:07.166
it probably would be it.

1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:10.833
- Yes.
- Yesterday you got terribly close to it

1:10:10.916 --> 1:10:13.041
on a couple of the numbers
you were trying to do.

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:16.666
- One more take and you've had it.
- It's just physical tiredness on my part.

1:10:16.750 --> 1:10:18.083
You know, it took great strain

1:10:18.166 --> 1:10:20.750
to get through "Don't Let Me Down"
and the other one.

1:10:20.833 --> 1:10:23.625
Just physically singing at that pace,
I'm being so tired.

1:10:23.708 --> 1:10:25.916
Well, that's the thing,
if you're planning on working up

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.291
till Ringo does the film,
doing it like this,

1:10:29.375 --> 1:10:31.041
you know, we're just gonna drop.

1:10:32.291 --> 1:10:34.291
I think-- I think yesterday…

1:10:36.125 --> 1:10:39.041
- At least we could've recorded all those.
- Was the result of not having the weekend.

1:10:39.125 --> 1:10:42.000
If we hadn't had the weekend, we wouldn't
have been able to even attempt yesterday.

1:10:42.083 --> 1:10:43.333
That's the paradox.

1:10:43.416 --> 1:10:45.666
But if we had just
been recording them, you know…

1:10:45.750 --> 1:10:48.583
And at the moment
the documentary is really like <i>No Exit</i>.

1:10:48.666 --> 1:10:51.375
It's just going around and around
and around with no payoff.

1:10:51.458 --> 1:10:52.458
There's no story.

1:10:52.541 --> 1:10:54.875
There's a lot of good stuff
that we shot in the documentary,

1:10:54.958 --> 1:10:56.250
but there's no story yet.

1:10:56.333 --> 1:11:01.666
Now I know how to get
this TV show together in about a week.

1:11:01.750 --> 1:11:04.291
But I can't do it with you.
I can't produce you.

1:11:04.375 --> 1:11:06.375
- Neither can anybody else.
- No, right.

1:11:06.458 --> 1:11:08.083
'Cause we don't allow it, you know.

1:11:08.666 --> 1:11:10.958
We don't allow people
to come and say, "You do that."

1:11:11.041 --> 1:11:13.750
That's why I'm creating
artificial frameworks for us to do it--

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:16.500
We've got a lot of good stuff,
like with some of the days at Twickenham.

1:11:16.583 --> 1:11:19.500
We've got great stuff, counterpoint thing.
But at the moment haven't got an ending.

1:11:19.583 --> 1:11:20.875
See, 'cause they've got the film,
you know.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:22.375
- I just wanna get out now.
- Yes.

1:11:22.458 --> 1:11:25.458
We've done the film.
We've done the numbers enough, you know?

1:11:25.541 --> 1:11:26.666
And we begin together--

1:11:26.750 --> 1:11:29.250
But, I mean, if George wants to think
while we're doing it

1:11:29.333 --> 1:11:30.500
that he's making a record.

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:33.166
- Yes.
- And you wanna think we're rehearsing.

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:34.458
It makes no odds, you know.

1:11:34.541 --> 1:11:35.750
So we've gotta decide

1:11:35.833 --> 1:11:38.166
that we mustn't then go on "Get Back"
for three hours.

1:11:42.458 --> 1:11:45.291
Or else I really feel like
I'm trying to produce The Beatles,

1:11:45.375 --> 1:11:46.958
and I know it's hopeless.

1:11:47.041 --> 1:11:48.333
I just can't do it, you know.

1:11:48.416 --> 1:11:49.625
And no one can do it

1:11:49.708 --> 1:11:52.916
'cause the four individuals
are too strong individually.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.916
- Yes, we know.
- So you want us to record these songs?

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.583
Yeah. Get it together now
instead of talking about the show.

1:11:59.666 --> 1:12:01.416
Get it, so that we've got 14 songs.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:04.166
We're talking about
this abstract thing we hope to get,

1:12:04.250 --> 1:12:05.833
and by talking about,
we're not getting it.

1:12:05.916 --> 1:12:07.000
Okay, let's do it.

1:12:07.083 --> 1:12:09.958
But, man, physically, yesterday
we tried to learn the next half.

1:12:10.041 --> 1:12:11.375
But physically we were too tired.

1:12:11.458 --> 1:12:13.000
- That's all it was.
- Yeah, that's right.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:14.541
And we're trying to do what you're saying,

1:12:14.625 --> 1:12:17.166
and we might have done
what he was saying at the same time,

1:12:17.250 --> 1:12:18.791
but we couldn't do it 'cause we're tired.

1:12:18.875 --> 1:12:19.875
- That's all.
- Yeah.

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:22.083
So we had--
We might have had a bit more sleep--

1:12:22.166 --> 1:12:26.000
You mean you're still expecting us to be
on the chimney with a lot of people,

1:12:26.083 --> 1:12:27.333
or something like that?

1:12:27.416 --> 1:12:29.875
Well, anyway, we won't worry
about that. Don't give us that one.

1:12:29.958 --> 1:12:32.041
"Expecting" is not a word we use anymore.

1:12:32.125 --> 1:12:33.125
Uh, "thinking about."

1:12:33.208 --> 1:12:35.458
- "Praying"?
- "Praying. Hoping."

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.375
Uh… well, now,
what about the roof tomorrow?

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:40.250
- Do you wanna collectively do it or not?
- No, let's--

1:12:40.333 --> 1:12:43.625
Let's-- Let's decide on that,
sort of, a bit later.

1:12:43.708 --> 1:12:45.708
Let's us keep off that.

1:12:45.791 --> 1:12:47.333
- We'll do the numbers, you know?

1:12:47.416 --> 1:12:48.791
We're the band.

1:12:48.875 --> 1:12:51.416
- "You're fucking right."

1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:54.041
No, you know, I-- You know, whatever.

1:12:54.125 --> 1:12:56.166
I'll do it if we've got to go on the roof.

1:12:56.250 --> 1:12:57.625
- You're the band now…
- You know, I mean…

1:13:04.583 --> 1:13:05.750
You would like to?

1:13:06.666 --> 1:13:07.666


1:13:08.875 --> 1:13:10.708
Very diverse people.

1:13:10.791 --> 1:13:13.000
- One second.
- But, I mean if… See, I don't mind…

1:13:13.083 --> 1:13:16.000
- That's all right. We won't discuss it.
- …if anybody doesn't wanna go on it.

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:18.125
- It wasn't that I--
- So what songs have we got?

1:13:18.208 --> 1:13:20.541
Have we got a sort of list
of what we've got, 'cause--

1:13:20.625 --> 1:13:23.291
A lot of them are…
I mean, there's too much of a list there.

1:13:23.375 --> 1:13:25.666
- But there's certainly everything here.
- Okay.

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:28.708
"I've Got a Feeling,"
"Don't Let Me Down," "Get Back."

1:13:28.791 --> 1:13:31.583
- Don't know what that is.
- "I'd Like a Love That's Right."

1:13:34.166 --> 1:13:36.750
"Long and Winding Road,"
"Let it Be," "For You Blue."

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:44.500
- I love "Yer Blue."
- "Two of Us," "All I Want is You,"

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:46.875
"Across The Universe,"
"Maxwell's Silver Hammer."

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:49.250
- "Route 999."
- "One After 909."

1:13:49.333 --> 1:13:50.875
- "One After 909."

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:52.916
Listen, there's no surprise numbers
even in this.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000
Surprises?

1:13:54.083 --> 1:13:56.541
I mean, there's nothing that'd throw us
to do it straight.

1:13:56.625 --> 1:13:58.500
"Bathroom Window," "Teddy Boy."

1:13:58.583 --> 1:14:00.583
We haven't gone through
"Maxwell's" since Twickenham.

1:14:00.666 --> 1:14:03.500
No. "All Things Must Pass."
That's lucky 13.

1:14:03.583 --> 1:14:05.458
There's "Dig It", as well,
which is very long.

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:08.958
It's like all these new ones
we've gotta do

1:14:09.041 --> 1:14:11.375
to make up the number don't exist.

1:14:11.458 --> 1:14:12.458
- Right.
- Great.

1:14:12.541 --> 1:14:13.791
We've got 'em all.

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:15.083
And you've got the live album.

1:14:15.166 --> 1:14:16.958
- Yeah.
- If you wanna do it, if we just find out--

1:14:17.041 --> 1:14:18.875
We should just collect
all the thoughts on these

1:14:18.958 --> 1:14:20.541
and just check through every song,

1:14:20.625 --> 1:14:24.416
like to know, say, make sure you know
all the chords, I know all the bass notes.

1:14:42.083 --> 1:14:44.208


1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:47.041


1:15:30.166 --> 1:15:31.375


1:15:31.458 --> 1:15:35.750


1:15:55.666 --> 1:15:56.875
Are we having lunch soon?

1:15:58.291 --> 1:16:00.375
- See you later.
- Ta-ra, girls.

1:16:00.458 --> 1:16:01.458
See ya.

1:16:07.916 --> 1:16:10.791
John, I'll tell you
what I'd like to do.

1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:12.625
Um…

1:16:12.708 --> 1:16:17.250
You know, I've got so many songs
that I've got me, like,

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:22.666
my quota of tunes
for the next ten years or albums.

1:16:23.291 --> 1:16:29.625
I'd just like to maybe do
an album of songs.

1:16:30.541 --> 1:16:31.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:16:31.708 --> 1:16:34.708
But, I mean,
I'd like it so that if, uh…

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:41.791
'Cause it would be nice. It would be nice
to mainly get them all out the way.

1:16:41.875 --> 1:16:42.708
Yes.

1:16:44.166 --> 1:16:48.791
And secondly, just to hear
what all mine are like all together.

1:16:53.250 --> 1:16:58.875
Yeah, but it'd be nice if
any of us can do separate things as well.

1:16:58.958 --> 1:17:04.625
That way it also preserves this,
the Beatle bit of it, more.

1:17:04.708 --> 1:17:05.708
Because then--

1:17:05.791 --> 1:17:07.916
Have an outlet
for every little note you want.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.458
You know,
'cause all these songs of mine,

1:17:10.541 --> 1:17:12.916
I could give to people
who could do 'em good.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.625
But I suddenly realized,
"You know, fuck all that.

1:17:15.708 --> 1:17:18.708
I'm just gonna do me for a bit. You know?"

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:21.000
- That's the real thing.
- It's great. That's a good idea.

1:17:21.083 --> 1:17:22.625
And, you know…

1:19:35.375 --> 1:19:36.375
This one.

1:20:22.291 --> 1:20:23.541
- Take it.
- Yes, sir.

1:21:15.625 --> 1:21:16.625
I'm going home.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:25.750
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

1:21:25.833 --> 1:21:28.375
- H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P…
- Greta Garbo.

1:21:28.458 --> 1:21:31.208
- …Q, S, R, T.
- Greta Garbo. Greta Garbo.

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:32.291
Greta Garbo.

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:35.083
No, that's not.

1:21:37.708 --> 1:21:39.958
Put the ones we know in a hat.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:42.416
Shuffle them out
to see which order we do 'em in.

1:21:44.791 --> 1:21:46.666
We'll all be here bright and early.

1:21:46.750 --> 1:21:48.000
11:30.

1:21:48.083 --> 1:21:50.750
We're all sleeping at George's tonight.
Get in the mood.

1:21:50.833 --> 1:21:52.458
We're all ready for tomorrow.

1:21:52.541 --> 1:21:54.375
So you're doing the show
on the roof tomorrow?

1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:00.250
Oh, sure, Albert Hall.
Sure. Five o'clock. See you there.

1:22:01.416 --> 1:22:02.333
Mm-hmm.

1:22:09.666 --> 1:22:11.458
- You'll go as well?
- Yeah.

1:22:11.541 --> 1:22:14.291
I think John and, uh, Ringo
are on the roof.

1:22:16.166 --> 1:22:18.125
In a green bag on the roof.

1:22:20.833 --> 1:22:22.208
Who knows, Yoko?

1:22:24.750 --> 1:22:26.791
Supposed to be, yeah. Yeah.

1:22:28.833 --> 1:22:30.750
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah. Let's do that.

1:22:30.833 --> 1:22:32.000
Go on the roof.

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:34.333
- Good night, Mike.

1:22:34.416 --> 1:22:36.500
- Seven come 11. Good night.
- The others are from…

1:22:36.583 --> 1:22:37.708
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:22:37.791 --> 1:22:39.500
- Good night!

1:22:39.583 --> 1:22:40.583
From your show.

1:22:40.666 --> 1:22:42.416
- Night, George.
- Good night, George!

1:22:43.166 --> 1:22:44.666
Good night, Sir Richard.

1:22:44.750 --> 1:22:47.000
I'll be here tomorrow
to film in the church.

1:22:59.958 --> 1:23:02.208
And then Tony and I
are gonna split downstairs.

1:23:04.083 --> 1:23:06.083


1:23:24.208 --> 1:23:25.208


1:23:40.208 --> 1:23:43.041
-
- Yeah?

1:23:48.833 --> 1:23:50.833
Would you like to go up
when you're ready?

1:23:51.625 --> 1:23:54.208
- What time is he expecting you?
- You can give them to Debbie.

1:23:54.291 --> 1:23:57.333
You know, it's exclusive.
It's gotta work for whoever does it.

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:00.208
Thank you.

1:24:08.875 --> 1:24:11.208
Let's get a camera
down in the hall now too.

1:24:17.041 --> 1:24:18.458


1:24:19.958 --> 1:24:21.458
Yeah, I heard about that.

1:24:27.083 --> 1:24:28.375


1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:36.208
- Yes.
- Is that the same kind of…

1:24:37.041 --> 1:24:39.208


1:24:39.291 --> 1:24:40.458
Okay, hold it.

1:24:41.750 --> 1:24:44.333
Three, two, one. All right.

1:24:53.541 --> 1:24:54.791
Hi. Can we come in?

1:24:55.708 --> 1:24:58.166
- Who you here for?
- Tony Richmond. Is he--

1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:08.125
There's a special lead
that goes under.

1:25:10.291 --> 1:25:11.541
Tony's ready, isn't he?

1:25:13.166 --> 1:25:14.500
Uh, with cameras?

1:25:14.583 --> 1:25:16.291
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:25:24.833 --> 1:25:26.416
Okay. Let's go.

1:25:27.541 --> 1:25:29.125
- Is it running?
- Yes.

1:25:29.208 --> 1:25:30.666
- We're running.
- Running.

1:25:30.750 --> 1:25:32.083
- What's going on?
- All right.

1:25:33.041 --> 1:25:34.666
All cameras, take one!

1:25:36.208 --> 1:25:37.958
Where's the best way
out of the way?

1:25:38.041 --> 1:25:39.166
Over here, I think.

1:25:39.250 --> 1:25:41.250
- Yeah, you would think that.
- With Maureen.

1:25:42.250 --> 1:25:44.250
See, you can never tell
what he's doing.

1:25:45.458 --> 1:25:46.458
Sorry.

1:25:47.291 --> 1:25:49.000
- Hey.
- You know you're around back.

1:25:51.458 --> 1:25:52.708
Which is you here.

1:25:54.958 --> 1:25:56.458
- We may find--
- All right, yeah?

1:25:56.541 --> 1:25:58.458
- It's a bit cold, isn't it?
- What's going on?

1:25:58.541 --> 1:26:00.375
It's, uh, great.

1:26:05.041 --> 1:26:07.125
- You're all right playing there?
- I don't know.

1:26:10.875 --> 1:26:12.416
- Good shot there.
- Yeah.

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.083
Where's the instruments?

1:26:15.166 --> 1:26:17.083
- Mal?

1:26:17.166 --> 1:26:18.916
Nailed me down in the wrong place.

1:26:19.458 --> 1:26:21.041
That's the last of it, yeah.

1:26:21.708 --> 1:26:23.958
The three-- First, second and third.

1:26:24.916 --> 1:26:27.416
- First of all, that seems to…
- I think if we have some…

1:26:28.250 --> 1:26:29.375
Are you sure?

1:26:29.458 --> 1:26:31.375
We've worked that out.

1:26:31.875 --> 1:26:33.375
- Let's set them up.
- Yeah.

1:26:39.041 --> 1:26:41.833
There's piping along there.
That's where you put them back in.

1:26:45.625 --> 1:26:46.791
Yeah, well that goes in here.

1:26:46.875 --> 1:26:48.416
- That should do it, really.
- Yeah.

1:26:50.416 --> 1:26:52.750
- What's that? A perfect fit.
- Yeah, man.

1:26:56.458 --> 1:26:57.541
What is it?

1:26:59.416 --> 1:27:00.916
Hands are getting the feel of it.

1:27:02.083 --> 1:27:03.458
It's gotta be like it is.

1:27:03.541 --> 1:27:05.208
Just record the song.

1:27:08.666 --> 1:27:10.416
Glyn, are you getting this down there?

1:27:12.583 --> 1:27:14.208
- Oh, it's right-handed.
- Is it?

1:27:14.291 --> 1:27:15.958
- Yeah.
- Kevin?

1:27:16.625 --> 1:27:19.458
- I missed the start. George--

1:27:19.541 --> 1:27:22.083
- Just look down. Must have had a few.
- Well, they're gonna hear it.

1:27:24.250 --> 1:27:26.541
- Final checks. Roll sound.
- Right.

1:27:26.625 --> 1:27:28.500
One, two, three, four…

1:27:57.708 --> 1:27:58.916
- Rolling.

1:27:59.875 --> 1:28:01.666
- Rolling. Is the door shut?

1:28:01.750 --> 1:28:03.000
- Come on.
- We're good to go.

1:28:03.083 --> 1:28:04.416
- Glyn, this one?
- No.

1:28:04.500 --> 1:28:06.250
The one at the bottom of the spirals.

1:28:06.333 --> 1:28:08.083
It's gotta be wedged.

1:28:08.166 --> 1:28:10.416
- Get the clapper.
- Come on, you idiot.

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.875
Get the clapper here.

1:28:11.958 --> 1:28:13.291
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:28:18.416 --> 1:28:19.458
Okay.

1:28:19.541 --> 1:28:21.041
One, two, three, four…

1:28:22.791 --> 1:28:23.791
Yeah.

1:31:22.375 --> 1:31:23.875
Whoo-hoo!

1:31:26.916 --> 1:31:28.791
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

1:31:28.875 --> 1:31:31.416
It looks like
Ted Dexter has scored another.

1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:33.833
We've had a request
from Martin and Luther.

1:31:33.916 --> 1:31:35.958
We need more voice on the PA, yes, Glyn?

1:31:36.041 --> 1:31:39.708
- No, we don't need any more.
- That's all right. Hello? Hello?

1:31:39.791 --> 1:31:43.041
Glyn, any more voice on the Fenders?

1:31:44.208 --> 1:31:45.916
<i>Do it there.</i>

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.166
- What?
- <i>Do it from up there.</i>

1:31:48.250 --> 1:31:50.000
No, they would have had
to turn off the whole roof.

1:31:50.083 --> 1:31:51.083
Okay, cut it.

1:31:52.291 --> 1:31:53.375
<i>Mike, have you cut?</i>

1:31:53.458 --> 1:31:55.083
- Yeah, we'll cut.

1:31:55.166 --> 1:31:56.708
Where's the noise coming from?

1:31:56.791 --> 1:31:58.333
It's coming from the roof.

1:31:58.416 --> 1:31:59.625
Do you know who it is?

1:31:59.708 --> 1:32:01.958
Yeah, The Beatles, ain't it?
Yeah.

1:32:02.041 --> 1:32:03.166
You like it?

1:32:03.250 --> 1:32:04.333
Yeah, it's okay.

1:32:04.416 --> 1:32:06.250
What do you think of it?
It's The Beatles.

1:32:06.333 --> 1:32:08.041
Oh, I think jolly good.

1:32:08.125 --> 1:32:09.125
Enjoying it?

1:32:09.208 --> 1:32:12.625
Yeah, very much. Nice, bright thing
to see at the end of the day.

1:32:12.708 --> 1:32:14.041
Do you like the idea?

1:32:14.125 --> 1:32:16.000
I don't know
what they're supposed to be doing.

1:32:16.083 --> 1:32:18.541
- Right, stop--
- All cameras, three!

1:32:18.625 --> 1:32:20.083
Okay. When you're ready, guys.

1:32:20.166 --> 1:32:21.166
All right, Billy.

1:32:21.750 --> 1:32:23.458
One, two, three, four.

1:33:00.625 --> 1:33:01.625
Get back, Jo Jo.

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:09.208
Go home.

1:33:12.625 --> 1:33:13.625
Yeah.

1:33:17.166 --> 1:33:18.750


1:33:18.833 --> 1:33:20.875
You could say so, yes.
I think they're great.

1:34:18.750 --> 1:34:20.125
Get back, Loretta.

1:34:26.458 --> 1:34:27.708
Yeah, go home.

1:34:30.458 --> 1:34:32.125
Your mommy's waiting.

1:34:32.208 --> 1:34:34.208
In her high-heel shoes
and her low-neck sweater.

1:34:34.291 --> 1:34:35.500
Get back, Loretta!

1:34:37.666 --> 1:34:38.666
Whoo!

1:34:46.291 --> 1:34:47.708


1:34:47.791 --> 1:34:49.208
I think it's marvelous. Yes.

1:34:49.291 --> 1:34:50.666


1:34:50.750 --> 1:34:51.791
Beatles, I think.

1:34:58.916 --> 1:35:01.583
Oh, get back home.

1:35:04.083 --> 1:35:05.916
Never more to roam.

1:35:08.041 --> 1:35:09.041


1:35:09.125 --> 1:35:10.333
On the roof?

1:35:18.416 --> 1:35:21.000


1:35:21.083 --> 1:35:22.583
It's The Beatles, isn't it? Yeah.

1:35:22.666 --> 1:35:25.625
It's Paul McCartney singing now.
Well, it was. Yeah.

1:35:25.708 --> 1:35:28.375
Okay. Well, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:35:28.458 --> 1:35:30.791
We've had a request
from Daisy, Morris and Tommy.

1:35:37.166 --> 1:35:38.791
- "Don't Let Me Down."
- Okay.

1:36:23.083 --> 1:36:25.500
This type of music
is all right in its place,

1:36:25.583 --> 1:36:28.541
but I think it's a bit of an imposition.
First of all, it's too loud.

1:36:51.875 --> 1:36:54.333
Absolutely disrupts all the business
in this area.

1:36:54.416 --> 1:36:56.291
I think it's great!
Who is this? The Beatles?

1:36:57.625 --> 1:36:58.833
I think it's fantastic.

1:38:59.708 --> 1:39:00.875
Don't let me down.

1:39:16.625 --> 1:39:17.791
That's right.

1:39:19.625 --> 1:39:21.666


1:40:13.541 --> 1:40:14.541


1:41:45.041 --> 1:41:46.666
Whoo-hoo!

1:42:01.041 --> 1:42:04.458


1:42:29.291 --> 1:42:30.291


1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.916
- That was so hard.

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000
Hey! All right!

1:42:38.291 --> 1:42:40.291
No, no, no, no.

1:42:42.583 --> 1:42:44.208
Peace on Earth!

1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:56.500
- Alan.

1:42:58.750 --> 1:42:59.750
<i>Ringo?</i>

1:42:59.833 --> 1:43:01.458
- Are the cameras still running?
- Yeah.

1:43:01.541 --> 1:43:03.750
<i>Just stick your snare drum mic</i>
<i>back over the snare drum.</i>

1:43:05.083 --> 1:43:08.166
Sir, we must have
your comment. What do you think of it?

1:43:08.250 --> 1:43:09.250
What's going on?

1:43:09.333 --> 1:43:11.833
- It's The Beatles.
- What gives? What's happening?

1:43:11.916 --> 1:43:13.958
They decided to play
for the public for nothing.

1:43:14.041 --> 1:43:15.250
Well, that's great.

1:43:15.333 --> 1:43:17.208
It's a bloody stupid place
to have a concert.

1:43:17.291 --> 1:43:19.833
Nice to have something for free
in this country at the moment, isn't it?

1:43:19.916 --> 1:43:22.541
- Don't you like The Beatles?
- No.

1:43:22.625 --> 1:43:24.166
- No?
- No.

1:43:24.250 --> 1:43:25.583
Not at all?

1:43:25.666 --> 1:43:28.041
Not now. They've changed completely.

1:43:28.125 --> 1:43:30.541
The Beatles are doing
a free concert on the roof.

1:43:30.625 --> 1:43:32.500
- Now?
- Yeah. What do you think of it?

1:43:33.041 --> 1:43:35.083
I think it's very good.
Why aren't they doing it in the street?

1:43:35.166 --> 1:43:36.833
They just thought you'd wanna hear it.

1:43:36.916 --> 1:43:38.625
Yeah, well, we'd also like to see them.

1:43:38.708 --> 1:43:41.166
I just can't see that it makes sense.

1:43:41.791 --> 1:43:43.500
Well, I think it's a very good thing.

1:43:43.583 --> 1:43:46.750
It woke me up from my sleep,
and I don't like it.

1:43:51.750 --> 1:43:53.416
All cameras, four!

1:43:54.666 --> 1:43:56.166
One, two, three.

1:44:36.041 --> 1:44:38.666


1:44:54.416 --> 1:44:56.500


1:44:57.875 --> 1:44:59.000


1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:46.500
Make sure you don't lean on that.

1:46:49.166 --> 1:46:51.500
I can't see what to do.

1:46:55.875 --> 1:46:57.166
- Oh.
- "Dig A Pony."

1:46:57.250 --> 1:46:58.708
I'll have to get the words then.

1:46:58.791 --> 1:47:00.375
- "Dig A Pony."
- <i>"Dig A Pony."</i>

1:47:09.125 --> 1:47:12.250
- I don't know. It's just, uh--
- Just ask Mal to hold 'em.

1:47:12.333 --> 1:47:13.333
Yeah.

1:47:13.416 --> 1:47:14.833
- Kev.
- Kevin?

1:47:15.416 --> 1:47:16.708
Come here.

1:47:20.416 --> 1:47:22.833
Can you hang on?
Well, I'll ring you back later, all right?

1:48:07.333 --> 1:48:08.333


1:48:10.583 --> 1:48:13.833


1:48:16.625 --> 1:48:17.833
Thank you very much.

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:21.458
We can't use City One Reserve.

1:48:23.625 --> 1:48:25.250
Charming, innit?

1:48:25.333 --> 1:48:26.416
- Jimmy?
- Hmm?

1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:27.875
Have a Sweet Afton.

1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:30.875
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

1:49:10.041 --> 1:49:11.041
Rolling.

1:49:15.333 --> 1:49:16.666
Are you all ready?

1:49:16.750 --> 1:49:18.541
Yeah? Okay. Are we rolling?

1:49:18.625 --> 1:49:19.708
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:49:19.791 --> 1:49:21.458
- One, two, three!
- Hold it!

1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:26.958
One, two, three…

1:50:01.416 --> 1:50:05.333


1:50:51.833 --> 1:50:54.833
Yeah, so why is it on the top of the roof?

1:50:54.916 --> 1:50:57.750


1:50:57.833 --> 1:51:00.541
All that money they've got?

1:51:00.625 --> 1:51:03.250


1:51:03.333 --> 1:51:05.541
No, I have no idea.
But it sounds really wonderful.

1:51:06.541 --> 1:51:07.541
Yes.

1:51:12.333 --> 1:51:13.333
Yes.

1:51:14.583 --> 1:51:15.583
Oh, yes.

1:51:16.458 --> 1:51:19.875
- Yes, I do. Yes.
- Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

1:51:19.958 --> 1:51:22.208


1:51:22.291 --> 1:51:23.500
Yes.

1:53:01.125 --> 1:53:07.041


1:53:10.583 --> 1:53:12.000
Thank you, brothers.

1:53:12.791 --> 1:53:15.208
My hands are getting too cold
to play a chord now.

1:53:15.291 --> 1:53:16.916
- Turn on the PA too.
- Okay.

1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.708
- Shall we do "Can You Dig It"?

1:53:18.791 --> 1:53:21.000
- "Can You Dig It"?
- I don't know.

1:53:41.708 --> 1:53:43.125
What's happening?

1:53:43.208 --> 1:53:44.708


1:53:49.666 --> 1:53:51.416


1:53:52.041 --> 1:53:53.375
The Beatles, obviously.

1:54:01.041 --> 1:54:04.208
- Fabulous. Lovely.
- Definitely. Fantastic.

1:54:04.291 --> 1:54:08.541


1:54:08.625 --> 1:54:11.916
- They're all a few lads.
- Yeah. Get around, don't they?

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.000


1:54:13.083 --> 1:54:14.708
- I said they get around.

1:54:34.541 --> 1:54:36.708
"Misery."
That's the one, I think.

1:54:38.041 --> 1:54:40.000
- That it?
- That's it. Lovely.

1:54:40.083 --> 1:54:42.583
Anywhere where I could
have a listen to this?

1:54:43.333 --> 1:54:44.875


1:54:44.958 --> 1:54:46.250
Yes. Very much. Yes.

1:54:47.166 --> 1:54:48.166
Yeah. It's great.

1:54:48.250 --> 1:54:49.541


1:54:49.625 --> 1:54:51.583
Um, I think Ringo.

1:54:52.416 --> 1:54:55.541


1:54:55.625 --> 1:54:56.625
No.

1:54:57.291 --> 1:54:58.291
No.

1:55:01.083 --> 1:55:02.666
Yeah.

1:55:02.750 --> 1:55:04.000
Yeah. I think they're good.

1:55:04.083 --> 1:55:05.666


1:55:09.125 --> 1:55:11.000


1:55:30.291 --> 1:55:32.541
Okay. Glynny.
Are you ready, Glyn?

1:55:32.625 --> 1:55:33.958
- <i>Running.</i>
- Turnover, Mike.

1:55:34.041 --> 1:55:35.541
Can we scratch that?

1:55:35.625 --> 1:55:37.541
- Tuning.
- Running. Ready?

1:55:40.291 --> 1:55:41.458
Okay, okay.

1:56:10.625 --> 1:56:12.708


1:56:12.791 --> 1:56:14.125
Not in the street, no.

1:56:14.791 --> 1:56:16.750


1:56:16.833 --> 1:56:19.250
- Oh, yes. Yes. Very much.
- You do?

1:56:19.333 --> 1:56:20.791


1:56:20.875 --> 1:56:22.458
No, my son does.

1:56:22.541 --> 1:56:24.083
Oh, yes. My daughter does.

1:56:24.791 --> 1:56:27.833
My son would.
He likes all that, but not me.

1:57:34.208 --> 1:57:35.541
Yeah, we'll come upstairs.

1:59:20.833 --> 1:59:21.958
Yeah.

1:59:22.041 --> 1:59:24.166
- One, two, three, four.
- "And For The First Time."

1:59:24.250 --> 1:59:26.666
- Oh!
- No, no, "Don't Let Me Down." Sorry.

1:59:30.708 --> 1:59:32.250
Rock and roll!

1:59:32.333 --> 1:59:33.500
You too!

1:59:34.666 --> 1:59:37.250
- Whoo!

1:59:58.458 --> 1:59:59.458
Whoo!

2:01:15.250 --> 2:01:16.250
Whoo!

2:01:40.250 --> 2:01:44.583


2:01:50.916 --> 2:01:52.083
Yeah, that's right.

2:01:55.708 --> 2:01:57.125


2:01:57.208 --> 2:01:58.208
Yes.

2:02:11.208 --> 2:02:12.500
Yeah.

2:02:12.583 --> 2:02:15.125


2:03:23.041 --> 2:03:24.125
It's off.

2:04:06.291 --> 2:04:07.375
Whoo!

2:04:13.416 --> 2:04:14.416
Whoo!

2:04:15.583 --> 2:04:16.583
Yeah!

2:05:01.791 --> 2:05:04.458


2:05:21.833 --> 2:05:23.083
Whoo!

2:05:23.166 --> 2:05:24.958


2:05:25.041 --> 2:05:26.625


2:05:54.083 --> 2:05:55.083
Get back.

2:06:00.583 --> 2:06:02.250
- Thanks, Mo.
- I'd like to say thank you

2:06:02.333 --> 2:06:04.125
on behalf of the group and ourselves.

2:06:04.208 --> 2:06:05.833
I hope we passed the audition.

2:06:08.541 --> 2:06:11.625
All right, boys.
Get in here. Step aside, there.

2:06:14.583 --> 2:06:15.750
You all right?

2:06:18.375 --> 2:06:20.416
Come. Get in there. Come on. In there.

2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:22.166
What's the matter? Everything all right?

2:06:23.041 --> 2:06:24.166
Hmm?

2:06:25.791 --> 2:06:28.541
Get some more cover there.
Film through the office windows.

2:06:28.625 --> 2:06:29.625
Okay.

2:06:30.250 --> 2:06:31.750
People on the roof. Everything.

2:06:31.833 --> 2:06:33.625
Stay there, girls. Stay there.

2:06:43.541 --> 2:06:44.625
Thank you.

2:06:44.708 --> 2:06:47.416
Okay. As soon as
you got the cover, that's a wrap.

2:06:49.958 --> 2:06:52.500
Let's keep it moving please.

2:06:52.583 --> 2:06:55.125
Step off the road, please.
Move along!

2:06:56.791 --> 2:06:58.375
Move along, please.

2:07:01.625 --> 2:07:02.875
Move along, please.

2:07:08.208 --> 2:07:09.541
Off the road, please.

2:07:11.083 --> 2:07:13.000
- Come on. Move along.

2:07:13.083 --> 2:07:16.083
What's the law say that you--
why you can't do that?

2:07:16.166 --> 2:07:18.666
- 'Cause of the PA speakers.
- Disturbing the peace.

2:07:18.750 --> 2:07:22.333
- Well, how-- "Disturbing the peace"?
- Peace means like noise.

2:07:22.416 --> 2:07:23.666
As Mike was saying,

2:07:23.750 --> 2:07:26.708
this is a very good dry run
for something else too.

2:07:26.791 --> 2:07:29.083
Apart from the value of this as it stands.

2:07:29.166 --> 2:07:30.166
Yeah.

2:07:30.250 --> 2:07:32.875
- Yeah, for taking over London.
- Yeah.

2:07:32.958 --> 2:07:35.166
- You see, because…
- Top of the Hilton tomorrow.

2:07:35.250 --> 2:07:36.916
Blasting out the sound in their power.

2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.208
- Fantastic.
- Every rock group in the world,

2:07:39.291 --> 2:07:41.750
in London, all on the top of buildings.

2:07:41.833 --> 2:07:44.375
- Playing the same tune.
- Also on a platform of loudspeakers.

2:07:44.458 --> 2:07:47.958
So you're just sort of strapped in
to little boxes in this structure.

2:10:02.375 --> 2:10:04.000
What are you feeling about today?

2:10:04.083 --> 2:10:05.916
- You wanna work more today or not?
- Yeah.

2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.916
We should record the others now.

2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.083
Gotta get the stuff down first.

2:10:10.166 --> 2:10:12.666
- Let's have a break for a bit.
- We'll have lunch and that.

2:10:12.750 --> 2:10:15.333
And then we record the other stuff
that we didn't do.

2:10:15.416 --> 2:10:17.583
- Right.
- Up there. The acoustic stuff.

2:10:17.666 --> 2:10:19.500
- Up there?
- No, down here now.

2:10:19.583 --> 2:10:21.250
- When I--
- There won't be more rooftops.

2:10:21.333 --> 2:10:22.333
No. No more rooftop.

2:10:22.416 --> 2:10:23.750
- That was the rooftop.
- It was really bad.

2:10:23.833 --> 2:10:25.375
- Oh, right.
- So, it's like--

2:10:25.458 --> 2:10:27.416
You know, you're doing this
and we're taking it--

2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:29.750
If we got the police,
we could pretend in the film

2:10:29.833 --> 2:10:31.625
that we had to get down because of them.

2:10:31.708 --> 2:10:33.875
- And here we are…
- Just the way it happened then.

2:10:33.958 --> 2:10:35.666
That'll just be it, you know.

2:10:35.750 --> 2:10:37.750


2:10:45.208 --> 2:10:48.833
This is B camera roll, 1,150.

2:10:48.916 --> 2:10:53.291
Slate 500, take one. Slate 500, take one.

2:10:53.375 --> 2:10:54.625
Roll mic.

2:10:54.708 --> 2:10:58.250
It might have been-- You know.
I don't like to throw things away.

2:10:58.333 --> 2:10:59.416
Okay. Ready?

2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:01.208
- Okay, turnover cameras.
- Clap it.

2:11:01.291 --> 2:11:02.583
Turnover cameras.

2:12:00.833 --> 2:12:01.833
Okay.

2:12:01.916 --> 2:12:03.541
- Running.
- Turn over.

2:12:03.625 --> 2:12:06.041
- Did I ever tell you when I had the--
- Take-- Take ten.

2:12:06.875 --> 2:12:08.583
I don't think
I wanna hear that, Dick.

2:12:09.750 --> 2:12:11.083
Okay, Jim.

2:12:12.750 --> 2:12:14.500
- Good night, Paul.
- Say good night, John.

2:12:14.583 --> 2:12:16.375
- Good night, Paul.
- Good night.

2:12:25.291 --> 2:12:28.541


2:12:28.625 --> 2:12:33.541


2:13:09.875 --> 2:13:12.708


2:13:12.791 --> 2:13:15.625


2:13:17.375 --> 2:13:19.875
Take-- Take-- Take 17!

2:13:33.416 --> 2:13:35.541
- Okay, start again.

2:13:42.583 --> 2:13:43.750
F-stop.

2:13:46.208 --> 2:13:47.875
We'll need one more, actually.

2:13:49.708 --> 2:13:50.708
Take 18.

2:13:54.083 --> 2:13:55.541
Now what's the chord you play…

2:14:26.083 --> 2:14:28.375
- Running.

2:14:28.458 --> 2:14:29.958
- Running, Col? Running, Mike?
- Yeah.

2:14:30.041 --> 2:14:31.833
- Running, yeah.
- Nice and quiet. Mark it.

2:14:31.916 --> 2:14:32.916
Take 25.

2:15:18.083 --> 2:15:20.375
- What the shittin' hell is going on here?

2:15:28.250 --> 2:15:30.958
<i>Eins, zwei, viertel nach drei.</i>

2:15:39.958 --> 2:15:41.625
What the fuck's going on?

2:15:41.708 --> 2:15:44.208
I'll never get "Maggie Mae" done
if we go on like this.

2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.333
Are we supposed to giggle in the solo?

2:15:51.416 --> 2:15:52.666
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2:15:56.750 --> 2:15:59.208
- Get off, you bum!

2:16:11.541 --> 2:16:14.000
- I lost a bass note somewhere.
- Oh.

2:16:28.833 --> 2:16:32.166


2:16:32.250 --> 2:16:35.250


2:16:35.333 --> 2:16:37.041


2:16:50.333 --> 2:16:51.500
Let it be.

2:17:07.958 --> 2:17:11.125
-

2:17:12.166 --> 2:17:14.708


2:17:14.791 --> 2:17:16.541


2:17:30.125 --> 2:17:33.583
- Is that the best one?
- I think that was rather grand.

2:17:34.083 --> 2:17:35.833
I'd take one home with me.

2:17:37.625 --> 2:17:38.666
Yeah, that was fine.

2:17:39.291 --> 2:17:41.208
Don't kid us, Glyn.

2:17:42.083 --> 2:17:44.125
Give it to us straight.

2:17:45.333 --> 2:17:47.416
- Get me off this bass.
- Was that good enough?

2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:50.750
- Yes.
- We'll do one more to cover ourselves.

2:17:50.833 --> 2:17:53.500
We'll just do one more
'cause we know we've got it now.

2:17:54.208 --> 2:17:56.125
We've got so many of the bastards.
