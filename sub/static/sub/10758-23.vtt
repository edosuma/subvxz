WEBVTT

00:10.597 --> 00:12.724
- Oh, hey, Niles.
- Hey, Roz.

00:12.933 --> 00:16.018
Oh, God, do you realise
how pathetic this is?

00:16.270 --> 00:17.980
It's 9:30 on a Saturday night

00:18.188 --> 00:21.817
and neither one of us are surprised
to see the other one here alone.

00:22.067 --> 00:23.944
Never seen this place
looking so grim.

00:24.152 --> 00:26.029
This is Mardi Gras
compared to half an hour ago

00:26.196 --> 00:28.156
when it was just me
and an elderly gentleman

00:28.365 --> 00:31.535
who cleaned his teeth
with his coffee stirrer

00:31.702 --> 00:34.162
and then put them back
in his mouth.

00:36.039 --> 00:40.085
- Let me get the waitress.
- Oh, God, not her. I hate her.

00:41.753 --> 00:44.589
She's in my spinning class at the gym.
I've been killing myself

00:44.798 --> 00:48.385
trying to take off these last five
pregnancy pounds, and nothing.

00:48.593 --> 00:51.054
Meanwhile, she's down
at the snack bar stuffing her face

00:51.263 --> 00:53.306
and waving to everybody,
acting all friendly.

00:53.515 --> 00:54.891
She's such a phoney.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.268
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Kit.

00:56.476 --> 00:58.520
You were great in class tonight.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.523
Are you kidding?
I've been such an oinker lately.

01:01.731 --> 01:04.400
- What can I get you?
- Oh, a non-fat latte for me.

01:04.566 --> 01:05.610
Coming right up.

01:05.819 --> 01:08.488
See what I mean?
She's such a fake.

01:08.655 --> 01:11.491
I'm sorry, Roz, I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be very good company tonight.

01:11.658 --> 01:13.785
Well, whatever your problems are,
you'll laugh at them

01:13.993 --> 01:15.453
when you hear
what I've been through.

01:15.662 --> 01:18.665
I had a date tonight,
but halfway down the driveway,

01:18.832 --> 01:20.542
he called me on my car phone
and cancelled.

01:20.708 --> 01:24.379
So I was too humiliated to go back
in the house and face the sitter.

01:24.587 --> 01:28.174
So don't ask me why,
I went to the zoo.

01:28.383 --> 01:29.759
You wanna feel good
about yourself?

01:29.926 --> 01:32.220
Put on your best outfit
and walk through the monkey house

01:32.428 --> 01:33.471
on a Saturday night.

01:34.305 --> 01:36.432
And be sure to stop by
and see Remo the Baboon

01:36.599 --> 01:40.311
who knows all kinds of ways
to have fun without a date.

01:43.606 --> 01:45.566
Feeling better about your problem?

01:46.234 --> 01:48.444
Daphne and Donny
got engaged yesterday.

01:48.653 --> 01:49.654
Oh, my God.

01:49.862 --> 01:52.615
Yeah, and lucky me,
I had to sit there and watch, horrified.

01:52.824 --> 01:54.700
Wasn't a thing I could do to stop it,

01:55.159 --> 01:57.829
much like your
monkey-house experience.

01:58.871 --> 02:01.541
I am so sorry, Niles. You really did
have a worse night than I did.

02:01.749 --> 02:06.379
- Hey, Roz.
- Wait, I'm gaining on you.

02:06.587 --> 02:09.507
Isn't this a splendiferous surprise?

02:09.674 --> 02:14.387
- So, Roz, Dr. Crane, is this a date?
- No, no, no, just a chance meeting.

02:14.553 --> 02:17.390
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.353
So, Roz, where is this person
you told me you had a date with?

02:22.561 --> 02:26.315
- That got cancelled.
- Oh, "cancelled," you say.

02:26.524 --> 02:30.820
And here you are showing up
at my regular Saturday-night hangout.

02:31.028 --> 02:33.239
Will the coincidences never stop?

02:35.199 --> 02:37.409
Perhaps you'd care to join me
for a late supper.

02:37.576 --> 02:41.872
No, Noel. As I said earlier today,
I am really not in the mood.

02:42.081 --> 02:44.291
Playing hard to get, I see.

02:45.209 --> 02:50.214
It's all part of the mating dance.
Watch and learn.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.974 --> 03:01.934
- Morning.
- Oh, Niles.

03:02.101 --> 03:05.020
Armani at 8 in the morning
on a Sunday?

03:05.187 --> 03:06.730
Yes, yes,
I'm having lunch with Maris.

03:06.939 --> 03:07.981
With Maris?

03:08.190 --> 03:11.193
Yeah, we scheduled this weeks ago.
She still has some of my first editions.

03:11.401 --> 03:13.195
I thought she'd be amenable
to returning them

03:13.403 --> 03:14.947
if I took her to her favourite bistro.

03:15.114 --> 03:19.576
Well, then the worst you're out
is a cup of clear broth.

03:19.827 --> 03:22.913
No, no, this is lunch. She takes
her large meal in the evening.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.960
I'm sorry to barge in so early.
I had to get out of the Montana.

03:28.168 --> 03:29.711
The couple next door
were just married.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.090
They kept me up all week
with their boisterous lovemaking.

03:33.966 --> 03:35.676
Why is it that
when you're by yourself,

03:35.884 --> 03:38.637
there's nothing but couples in love
rubbing it in your face?

03:38.845 --> 03:40.722
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi.

03:44.851 --> 03:46.311
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?

03:46.520 --> 03:48.647
- Well, actually...
- Oh, come on, you've got to.

03:48.855 --> 03:50.023
I brought some pastries.

03:50.190 --> 03:52.317
I didn't even hear you two
come in last night.

03:52.484 --> 03:55.403
Yeah, well, we got in kind of late.
We took a long walk after dinner.

03:55.612 --> 03:57.072
Yeah, it was great.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.616
The streets were deserted,
it was all misty out.

03:59.824 --> 04:03.328
It was like we were
the only two people in town.

04:04.037 --> 04:06.456
I wonder if Maris would rather
have breakfast than lunch.

04:06.665 --> 04:07.916
No, Niles, here, put that down.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.918
Wait, now, Frasier,
if Niles wants to leave...

04:10.126 --> 04:12.087
Dad, there is no reason for Niles
to feel awkward.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.255
You're here,
it's not like he's some third wheel.

04:14.506 --> 04:15.882
Good morning.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.387
Hey.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.642
You boys remember Bonnie
from McGinty's.

04:25.809 --> 04:27.519
- Yes.
- I was at the Super Bowl, remember?

04:27.727 --> 04:29.771
- I brought the ham loaf.
- Well, who could forget?

04:30.605 --> 04:33.358
We talked about it long after.

04:33.817 --> 04:35.944
It came up almost daily.

04:36.569 --> 04:37.737
Aren't you sweet.

04:37.946 --> 04:41.032
- I'm just gonna get some coffee.
- Okay.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.828
You could've told me
you were having Faye over.

04:46.079 --> 04:49.165
Well, I'm sorry, Dad,
I didn't realise you were seeing Bonnie.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.500
I see her from time to time.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.460
- You got a problem with Bonnie?
- Well, no.

04:52.669 --> 04:55.046
If you're bringing it up,
I have second thoughts about Faye.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.298
I liked the other one you were seeing,
Cassandra.

04:57.507 --> 05:00.093
- She was a dish.
- Look, I don't care.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.763
I prefer Faye.
I had to make a choice,

05:03.930 --> 05:06.265
no matter how much fun it was
dating two beautiful women.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.061
This morning just gets better
and better.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.314
- Who wants coffee and pastry?
- Oh, nothing for me, thanks.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.233
Are you sure?
I make a mean nut cake.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.486
No, that's all right,
I'm meeting one for lunch.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.074
So, Bonnie,
I see you've met Cassandra.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.619
- Who?
- Oh, Lord, I'm sorry.

05:26.786 --> 05:29.705
- Faye.
- Who's Cassandra?

05:29.872 --> 05:34.752
My Aunt Cassandra, yes,
that must be the connection.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.253
So you remind me a bit of her.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.006
And, God, she was an angel,
wasn't she, Dad?

05:39.215 --> 05:42.802
Oh, Cassandra? Great gal.
I wish she was around.

05:44.887 --> 05:48.807
Eddie, good morning.
I bet you can't wait to meet Lady.

05:49.058 --> 05:51.268
Yeah, we're getting Eddie together
with Bonnie's poodle.

05:51.477 --> 05:54.146
We figure if we hit it off, maybe
something will happen for them.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.315
Even dogs deserve happiness.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.817
Okay, well, I'll be off.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.487
Oh, hold on, you've got a loose button
right there.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.990
- No, no, it's all right. No, no, please...
- No, it's about to come off. See?

06:05.199 --> 06:08.786
Here, I'll sew it back on for you.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.329
I've got needle and thread.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.748
- You don't wanna lose it, do you?
- I'm trying not to.

06:12.915 --> 06:18.587
- Frasier, I have to get out of here.
- Niles, Niles, listen, just relax.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.964
There's no cause for an anxiety attack.
Come on.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.970
Breathe into this.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.516
I didn't know you were here last night.
Why doesn't someone say something?

06:31.683 --> 06:32.976
We planned on going to my place,

06:33.185 --> 06:36.104
but we ended up at a little piano bar
just around the corner from here.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.231
It was such a charming spot,
so intimate.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.318
And to top it off, the piano player
knew all my favourite songs.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.528
"Yesterday,"
"As Long as He Needs Me,"

06:43.695 --> 06:45.405
"Climb Ev'ry Mountain."

06:45.614 --> 06:48.033
Wow, you threw him
some real curves there.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.537
Hi. I'm Donny Douglas,
and I'm in love.

06:54.206 --> 06:57.709
Listen to him. He embarrasses me
like that at least ten times a day.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.669
And I just can't get enough of it.

07:03.131 --> 07:07.677
- How are we coming on the button?
- I almost got the needle threaded.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.557
You know, if anybody's hungry,

07:12.724 --> 07:16.770
we've got plenty of goodies here
from Le Cigare Volant.

07:16.978 --> 07:20.315
- Cassandra's the pastry chef there.
- She is? I thought I was.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.859
I'm so sorry. God, I did it again.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.112
I guess I must have her name
on my mind.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.199
Well, that's okay,
just try to remember mine.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.411
- Faye.
- Yeah, Faye, of course.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.247
Oh, Faye.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.790
I'm kind of glad this worked out.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.293
Neither Daphne nor I
has any family here in Seattle.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.712
What I'd like to do
is I'd like to make this

07:42.879 --> 07:44.589
our engagement breakfast...

07:47.133 --> 07:50.470
...surrounded by friends
who treat us like family.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.804
And I'd like to dedicate it

07:52.013 --> 07:56.559
to the woman who's filled my life
with a joy I never thought I'd find.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.771
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.564
Oh, Marty, I'm gonna cry.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.318
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, my God, look at that ring.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.244
That's it for today.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane

08:15.453 --> 08:18.372
saying goodbye
and good mental health.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.667
Nice job there, Roz.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.712
Could you try to find callers
that have real psychological problems?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.964
Your dad's on line two.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.342
I meant during the show, thanks.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.596
Yeah, Dad, hi.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.765
What? Again? Well, that's
the third time he's cancelled this week.

08:36.932 --> 08:38.642
You know, if he's been so Ionely,

08:38.808 --> 08:41.895
you'd think he'd be glad
for my company. Well...

08:42.104 --> 08:45.524
Well, all right, no matter.
I guess I'll see you at home in a while.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.359
Well, I don't know, later.

08:47.568 --> 08:51.405
I don't know, maybe an hour,
two hours, I don't know.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.740
Oh, for God's sake.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.410
Look, just hang a tie on the door
if you're so worried about it.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.376
Is everything okay, Frasier?

09:05.294 --> 09:08.464
Oh, yeah, yeah, Roz.
I was just thinking about something.

09:08.672 --> 09:11.216
You know, it's funny how Ioneliness

09:11.425 --> 09:13.135
can make people behave
in strange ways.

09:13.385 --> 09:14.386
What do you mean?

09:14.595 --> 09:17.681
Well, you know, do things
that are sort of rash, you know,

09:17.890 --> 09:19.183
act out of character.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.976
I knew someone would find out
about it.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.311
Who told you? Did he tell you?

09:22.519 --> 09:23.687
- I'll kill him.
- Roz.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.106
Please, Frasier, don't tell anybody else.
Oh, I beg you.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.525
It was one night.
One Ionely, stupid night.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.194
What are you talking about?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.863
- You don't know?
- No. What happened?

09:33.113 --> 09:36.867
- Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow.
- No, Roz, Roz, Roz. Stay right here.

09:37.075 --> 09:39.286
Now, you listen to me,
I am your friend, you know that.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.580
I would never judge you.

09:41.788 --> 09:44.708
Now, just how stupid and Ionely
were you?

09:45.667 --> 09:49.004
It's the last person
I ever would have dreamed of.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.548
I just guess I haven't been...

09:52.299 --> 09:56.428
I haven't been dating much lately,
and I've just been so Ionely.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.556
Oh, my God, you slept with Noel.

09:59.806 --> 10:03.560
No! Oh, how could you even think
such a thing?

10:03.727 --> 10:07.063
All right, now, listen, listen, just tell me.
Now, who was it?

10:07.272 --> 10:09.649
Nobody. It doesn't matter.
It was a mistake. It's over.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.318
I just wanna forget it ever happened.

10:11.526 --> 10:14.195
No, Roz, Roz, listen, you know,
we've all been there.

10:14.404 --> 10:16.823
Come on, you were just looking
for a little comfort.

10:17.032 --> 10:19.951
It's all right.
No reason to beat yourself up about it.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.370
Hey, baby, I'm sorry I had to skip out
before breakfast.

10:22.579 --> 10:25.248
- Oh, Bulldog.
- Bulldog?

10:25.457 --> 10:27.959
- Bulldog.
- Bulldog!

10:30.045 --> 10:32.255
Oh, Frasier,
swear you won't tell anybody else.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.758
So you told the doc, huh?
Guess you just had to brag, huh?

10:34.966 --> 10:37.802
Hey, hey, I don't blame you.
I told a few guys myself.

10:37.969 --> 10:40.013
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

10:40.263 --> 10:44.642
- Gee, where have I heard that before?
- I'll just leave you two alone.

10:44.893 --> 10:47.645
- I'm right behind you.
- Gee, where have I heard that before?

10:47.854 --> 10:50.440
Stop that.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.359
Look, Bulldog,
last night was a mistake.

10:53.526 --> 10:55.778
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

10:55.987 --> 10:59.490
And if you ever bring it up again,
I promise you, you will regret it.

10:59.657 --> 11:01.034
Hey.

11:08.499 --> 11:12.170
- Your place tonight.
- Ten o'clock. Use the service elevator.

11:20.678 --> 11:23.681
- How's the speech coming along?
- Oh, it's almost finished.

11:23.931 --> 11:29.520
So though you are graduating today,
your learning is just begun.

11:30.479 --> 11:33.149
There's something in the cushions
back here.

11:33.357 --> 11:35.067
- What, you found something?
- Yeah, it's...

11:35.276 --> 11:38.029
Oh, it's a cell phone.
Is this Frasier's?

11:38.195 --> 11:40.323
No, he had his when he left for work
this morning.

11:40.489 --> 11:43.159
Must be his brother's.
I'll tell him the next time he's over.

11:43.367 --> 11:46.454
I'm gonna finish tidying up
the kitchen.

11:47.413 --> 11:48.414
Hello.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.875
- Hey, Fras.
- Hello, Donny.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.752
Hope I didn't come home
at an inconvenient moment.

11:53.961 --> 11:57.047
No, your timing's perfect, actually.
One egg roll left.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.842
- Nice hands.
- Yes, they were.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.846
- Here's your drink.
- Oh, thanks. Isn't she great?

12:04.013 --> 12:08.559
She takes me on a three-mile run
and then feeds me diet soda.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.604
I thought I'd hate healthy living,
but, you know, it ain't so bad.

12:12.354 --> 12:15.107
Daphne, why are you wearing
that rubber glove?

12:15.274 --> 12:19.111
What, this? I was doing the dishes.

12:19.278 --> 12:22.448
- With just one?
- It's the English way.

12:23.157 --> 12:24.950
You wash with the left,
dry with the right.

12:25.117 --> 12:27.578
Started during the war, I think,
when rubber was rationed.

12:27.828 --> 12:29.204
Oh, yes.

12:29.788 --> 12:31.748
- Can I see you in the kitchen?
- Yes, of course.

12:31.957 --> 12:34.418
Let me just call Niles first.
He cancelled on me again today.

12:34.626 --> 12:37.629
I'll just be a second here. I just gotta
check up on a case I'm finishing.

12:37.796 --> 12:40.257
Poor bastard,
I'm really taking him to the cleaners.

12:40.465 --> 12:44.761
Well, perhaps you'd be so kind
as to bring the couch along.

12:44.970 --> 12:45.971
Yes, Daphne?

12:46.179 --> 12:47.973
I'm afraid a terrible thing
has happened.

12:48.181 --> 12:51.435
- I've lost my engagement ring.
- Where was the last place you saw it?

12:51.643 --> 12:53.520
Well, that's just it,
I've searched everywhere.

12:53.687 --> 12:55.230
I'm terrified Donny will find out.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.357
You can't go around
hiding your hand forever.

12:57.566 --> 13:00.902
You're gonna have to tell him. He's
a reasonable man, he'll understand.

13:01.111 --> 13:02.112
I suppose you're right.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.656
No, you're negligent, pal.
You're criminally irresponsible.

13:04.865 --> 13:07.242
You were careless
and you're gonna pay for it. Yeah.

13:07.451 --> 13:08.827
- Here you go, boss.
- Thank you.

13:08.994 --> 13:11.454
- Hey, Daph?
- Yes, love?

13:13.039 --> 13:14.040
What are you doing?

13:14.291 --> 13:18.128
Oh, I'm just stuffing the bird
for Dr. Crane's dinner.

13:19.713 --> 13:21.923
Listen, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to work late.

13:22.090 --> 13:23.800
I'm gonna just pop in the shower
and leave.

13:23.967 --> 13:24.968
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:25.176 --> 13:28.096
Well, that's okay. Absence just
makes the heart grow fonder.

13:33.768 --> 13:36.312
You know, Daphne,
if that ring never turns up,

13:36.521 --> 13:39.858
that chicken works too.
Just see how it catches the light.

13:40.066 --> 13:42.652
Oh, stop it. I'm just gonna have
another look in the bedroom.

13:42.861 --> 13:44.237
All right.

13:44.446 --> 13:46.322
Yeah, hello?

13:46.489 --> 13:49.576
Niles, it's Frasier.

13:49.742 --> 13:53.454
Yes, listen, I've tried you at your office,
I've tried you at home,

13:53.663 --> 13:55.290
now I'm calling your cell phone.

13:55.456 --> 13:59.836
If I don't reach you now, I'm actually
going to get very worried about you.

14:15.059 --> 14:16.144
Hello?

14:16.310 --> 14:17.937
Yes, hello.
Is Niles Crane there, please?

14:18.187 --> 14:22.024
I don't know, I just got here.
Let me go check.

14:25.987 --> 14:27.155
Frasier, have you seen Niles?

14:27.321 --> 14:29.532
- I'm just trying to reach him, Dad.
- Oh, okay.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.330
No, I'm sorry, he's not here,

14:36.539 --> 14:40.835
but I'll write your name down
and give it to him.

14:41.002 --> 14:43.212
Wait a minute, I gotta find a pen.

14:47.216 --> 14:50.553
- Fras, have you seen...?
- Dad, please, I'm on the phone.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.765
Well, I'm sorry,
I was just looking for a pen. Forget it.

15:01.021 --> 15:04.608
Hello? Listen, could you maybe
call back in an hour?

15:04.817 --> 15:06.694
- Dad.
- Would you mind, please?

15:06.902 --> 15:08.779
I'm on the phone.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.201
Dad, it's me.

15:14.368 --> 15:17.037
Frasier, what are you doing?
Why'd you call from the kitchen?

15:17.204 --> 15:20.124
- You could have just walked in here.
- Just hang up the phone.

15:20.291 --> 15:24.044
For God's sake,
it must be Niles' cell phone...

15:24.253 --> 15:26.797
Gee, that's strange. You know,
he's never without that phone.

15:28.173 --> 15:30.843
And what's more, he's been
avoiding me for the last three days.

15:31.051 --> 15:32.594
Oh, cut him a little slack.

15:32.845 --> 15:35.931
Seeing the six of us the other morning
couldn't have done much for his mood.

15:36.098 --> 15:38.642
He's probably just gone off somewhere
to be by himself.

15:38.851 --> 15:40.644
I just hope
he hasn't done something foolish.

15:40.894 --> 15:43.647
Remember, he was having brunch
with Maris on Sunday.

15:43.856 --> 15:45.107
Oh, that was just business.

15:45.315 --> 15:47.985
Yeah. Well, you know, Dad,
he is broken-hearted.

15:48.193 --> 15:51.113
People in his condition have
a tendency to run back to their exes.

15:51.321 --> 15:53.991
A Ionely man clinging
to an available warm body.

15:54.199 --> 15:58.578
Well, of course, in Maris' case,
that's just an expression.

15:59.830 --> 16:03.166
He just spent two years divorcing her,
he's not gonna go back to her.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.127
Yeah, I hope you're right.

16:05.335 --> 16:07.379
Say, didn't you have plans today
with Bonnie?

16:07.587 --> 16:09.464
No, it was cut short.

16:09.673 --> 16:12.092
- We had an incident.
- What happened?

16:12.300 --> 16:14.261
Well, we took the dogs
to this park near Bonnie's,

16:14.469 --> 16:17.139
and I knew there'd be a little
sizing each other up and everything,

16:17.347 --> 16:21.560
but this poodle of hers, Lady,
which she ain't,

16:22.477 --> 16:24.104
walks up to Eddie, knocks him over,

16:24.312 --> 16:28.066
and then sits her big French butt
right on his head.

16:28.817 --> 16:29.818
- You're kidding.
- No.

16:30.026 --> 16:32.779
And the worst thing was he
just laid there whimpering and took it.

16:32.988 --> 16:35.448
And Bonnie,
she thought it was really cute.

16:35.615 --> 16:39.035
I mean, what kind of a person
likes to see a dog humiliated?

16:39.285 --> 16:41.955
Dad, may I remind you
that not a holiday goes by

16:42.163 --> 16:45.166
that you don't dress that dog up
in some sort of ridiculous hat?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.836
There's nothing wrong with those hats.
He looks good in hats.

16:48.044 --> 16:49.212
He's got a hat face.

16:50.046 --> 16:53.216
Well, he was probably just intimidated
being in Lady's park, you know?

16:53.424 --> 16:55.135
Wait till he gets over
to this side of town.

16:55.343 --> 16:58.012
He owns that park.
Even the big dogs are scared of him.

16:58.179 --> 17:01.099
That's because they've seen him
in his hats, they think he's crazy.

17:03.726 --> 17:05.979
It's Niles' cell phone.

17:07.981 --> 17:11.567
Hello? Niles Crane's phone.

17:13.027 --> 17:17.740
Yes, it's his brother.
I'll be glad to tell him. Thank you.

17:20.660 --> 17:24.955
Well, that was St. Pierre Jewelers.

17:25.164 --> 17:27.708
The diamond earrings Niles ordered
are ready.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.545
Diamond earrings?

17:30.753 --> 17:32.547
From Maris' favourite jeweller.
You know what?

17:32.755 --> 17:34.966
He's too ashamed to tell us
that he's run back to her.

17:35.174 --> 17:38.761
Oh, now, stop that, you're scaring me.
He doesn't have to be with Maris.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.889
Maybe he's hurt.
Maybe he's in a hospital or something.

17:42.098 --> 17:44.392
We've got to track him down
and talk some sense into him.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.853
We'll head over to the Montana.
If he's not there, we'll go to Maris'.

17:48.020 --> 17:50.940
Well, I don't wanna go to Niles'
and I sure don't wanna go to Maris'.

17:51.148 --> 17:53.984
This is not about what you or I want,
this is about what Niles needs.

17:54.151 --> 17:55.861
The man is devastated,
he's vulnerable.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.030
We need to rally around him,
show him our support.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.118
- Why didn't we do this on Sunday?
- We had our girlfriends over.

18:09.041 --> 18:12.044
Dad, what are you doing back there?
What are you so worried about?

18:12.253 --> 18:13.796
What do you think?
Running into Maris.

18:13.963 --> 18:15.256
You know how angry she gets.

18:15.464 --> 18:18.717
I just wish we had a sharp stick
or a heavy net or something.

18:19.885 --> 18:21.053
- Niles.
- Yes?

18:21.262 --> 18:23.764
Where have you been? You haven't
even answered any of my calls.

18:23.973 --> 18:25.933
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

18:26.141 --> 18:28.268
No, no, no.
I wanna talk to you right now.

18:28.519 --> 18:30.646
Well, I can't, I'm entertaining,
so off you go.

18:30.813 --> 18:33.482
We're not leaving without you.
Put on your shower shoes and a coat.

18:33.691 --> 18:35.734
- Let's get out of here.
- What is wrong with you?

18:35.984 --> 18:38.362
I know how difficult the last
three weeks have been for you,

18:38.570 --> 18:40.364
but I am sorry,
you are making a big mistake.

18:40.572 --> 18:42.032
This is not the way to handle it.

18:42.241 --> 18:44.910
- So you know what's going on?
- Yes, Niles.

18:45.077 --> 18:46.703
How did this whole thing
even get started?

18:46.912 --> 18:50.165
Well, we had an impromptu coffee
at the Café Nervosa,

18:50.374 --> 18:52.584
and that led to a movie,
and that led to dinner,

18:52.793 --> 18:55.254
and then ever since then,
we've been practically inseparable.

18:55.462 --> 18:57.673
And to tell you the truth,
we're kind of happy about it.

18:57.881 --> 18:59.841
How do you even know about this?

19:01.134 --> 19:05.597
Your jeweller called.
Your diamond earrings are ready.

19:05.764 --> 19:07.724
Oh, well, thank you for the message.
Now, go away.

19:07.933 --> 19:10.185
No, Niles, no.
I'm sorry, we're not going anywhere.

19:10.394 --> 19:12.604
You may consider this
a full-blown intervention.

19:12.854 --> 19:15.774
We're not leaving until you have got
some self-respect back.

19:15.982 --> 19:18.026
Niles, you know what we should
do tonight? Oh, hi.

19:18.276 --> 19:21.113
Build a fire and make Smores.

19:21.321 --> 19:24.241
Might also wanna get
some graham crackers.

19:24.908 --> 19:26.952
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know we had company.

19:27.118 --> 19:30.997
- No, no, that's okay, Kit. This is...
- Wait, I know you from the café.

19:31.206 --> 19:34.793
Cappuccino, light foam. And you too,
coffee black, nothing fancy.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.836
Isn't that good?

19:37.045 --> 19:40.882
Kit, this is my father, Martin,
and my brother, Frasier.

19:41.049 --> 19:45.970
- Yes, how do you do?
- Really? I see it. Cool.

19:46.179 --> 19:48.473
You know, this is sort of a surprise.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.976
I guess I didn't expect to see
the two of you together.

19:52.227 --> 19:54.187
Oh, I had my eye on him
from the minute I saw him.

19:54.395 --> 19:59.192
He's always so neat and put together.
I just wanted to mess him up.

20:01.027 --> 20:03.488
And mission accomplished.

20:03.655 --> 20:07.700
So, Niles, you haven't seen Maris then
since Sunday?

20:09.244 --> 20:10.787
Is that who you thought
I was here with?

20:10.995 --> 20:12.538
That's funny.
No wonder you were upset.

20:12.747 --> 20:14.791
- Who's Maris?
- That's my ex-wife.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.918
Oh, well, if you wanna see her too,
that's cool.

20:17.126 --> 20:22.006
I told you, no strings, just fun.

20:22.215 --> 20:25.843
You always want your kids
to have more than you had.

20:32.350 --> 20:36.187
Niles, pick up, will you? It's Frasier.

20:36.854 --> 20:40.107
All right, fine. Call me later.

20:40.316 --> 20:41.859
I don't even know
why I bother anymore.

20:42.068 --> 20:46.697
He doesn't pick up phones these days,
just waitresses.

20:47.823 --> 20:50.284
Give him a break,
he's just having fun.

20:50.534 --> 20:51.702
That's what I'd expect to hear

20:51.911 --> 20:55.414
from someone willing to spend
the night as Bulldog's squeak toy.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.043
That is not funny. It was one night,

20:59.210 --> 21:01.420
and I would appreciate it
if you would just let it drop.

21:01.629 --> 21:03.839
You're right, I'm sorry,
that was tactless of me.

21:04.048 --> 21:06.717
Let me make it up to you.
I've got an extra theatre ticket tonight.

21:06.926 --> 21:08.552
Faye's busy.
Why don't you join me?

21:08.761 --> 21:10.137
- No, thanks.
- No, please, Roz.

21:10.304 --> 21:14.266
Look, it's a delightful little show,
and I'll even throw in dinner.

21:14.475 --> 21:16.894
- Busy.
- Really? A date?

21:17.144 --> 21:19.730
I have plans. Plans.
What are you, a cop?

21:19.939 --> 21:21.565
I got to account
for every waking minute?

21:21.774 --> 21:25.819
- My private life is my own business.
- Bulldog.

21:26.070 --> 21:28.739
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm weak, I can't stop myself.

21:28.989 --> 21:31.033
- Yes, you can.
- Okay, I don't wanna stop myself.

21:31.241 --> 21:34.995
He's good, he's really good.
I mean, I'm better, but he's trainable.

21:35.621 --> 21:38.457
Roz, it's Bulldog.
Doesn't that bother you?

21:38.665 --> 21:41.085
You'd think.

21:41.919 --> 21:43.003
- Hey, doc.
- Bulldog.

21:43.212 --> 21:47.841
Oh, Roz, you still gonna help me write
those promos for my show tonight?

21:48.050 --> 21:50.594
- Around 10:00?
- It's okay, Bulldog, he knows.

21:50.803 --> 21:54.223
Yes, but high marks
on that cryptic cover story.

21:55.974 --> 21:56.975
Well, I gotta make a call.

21:57.184 --> 21:59.394
Station manager's been
calling me all day.

22:01.271 --> 22:02.981
I made us a reservation.

22:03.148 --> 22:06.652
Thought maybe we could
get a little dinner first.

22:07.736 --> 22:10.656
You mean eat together?

22:11.948 --> 22:14.951
Yeah. I'll be right back.

22:18.497 --> 22:19.873
That's beautiful, Roz.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.626
- Oh, God, this ruins everything.
- What?

22:22.876 --> 22:25.337
Well, didn't you hear what he said?
He wants to buy me dinner.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.838
Do you realise what this means?

22:27.088 --> 22:30.008
They finally opened that new Hooters
out by the airport?

22:32.010 --> 22:34.679
No, he's crossed the line.
He actually thinks we're dating.

22:34.888 --> 22:38.725
Roz, didn't your mother warn you that
sex could lead to things like dating?

22:38.934 --> 22:43.980
Look, that is it. I'm gonna put an end
to this before it goes too far.

22:48.318 --> 22:49.527
Can't believe it.

22:50.528 --> 22:52.155
They just fired me.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.949
What?

22:55.575 --> 23:01.831
Yeah, said my ratings were low,
show's losing its edge, I'm getting soft.

23:01.998 --> 23:06.461
- My last day's Friday.
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm so sorry.

23:06.711 --> 23:10.215
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

23:10.423 --> 23:15.762
This stinks. This is total B.S. You don't
think I'm getting soft, do you?

23:15.970 --> 23:18.973
No, no, not at all. Here.

23:21.059 --> 23:24.062
I just thank God
I got a girlfriend like you, Roz.

23:29.067 --> 23:31.110
I don't think I could face this alone.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.405
There, there.

23:47.084 --> 23:49.045
Daphne.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.339
- Morning, Dad.
- Hi.

23:51.547 --> 23:53.257
Yes?

23:55.551 --> 23:57.261
Daphne, please, Donny's not here.

23:57.428 --> 24:00.014
Will you just take your hand
out of the bag?

24:00.264 --> 24:02.224
I was just undressing
to take my bath,

24:02.391 --> 24:07.563
and I sat on the edge of the tub
and landed on this.

24:07.772 --> 24:11.108
Oh, my God, you found my ring.

24:12.276 --> 24:15.112
I'd given up. I thought
it was some place I'd never find it.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.364
It very nearly was.

24:20.367 --> 24:23.204
- Come on, let me have it.
- No, rinse off this doodle dust first.

24:23.370 --> 24:25.748
- Oh, right, of course.
- All right, yeah.

24:25.956 --> 24:27.666
Well, you sure saved Daphne there.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.752
Yes, I also did myself
a little favour as well.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.296
Can you imagine what conclusions
Faye might have jumped to

24:32.504 --> 24:35.341
had she found this engagement ring
in my room?

24:35.507 --> 24:39.553
- Frasier, for me? I had no idea.
- Well, actually...

24:39.803 --> 24:45.893
It's beautiful. It's so beautiful.
Yes, Frasier, I do, I do.

24:47.603 --> 24:51.190
Oh, calm down, you big dope.
I know it's Daphne's ring.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.445
And I can't tell you
how flattered I am

24:56.612 --> 24:58.739
by those beads of sweat
on your forehead.

24:58.989 --> 25:02.618
No, they're love beads, honey.
Oh, God. Will you take this thing?

25:02.826 --> 25:04.953
Well, I don't want it.
What if Bonnie sees me with it?

25:05.162 --> 25:06.705
Sees you with what?

25:06.914 --> 25:09.458
Daphne, will you come in here
and take this damn ring, please?

25:09.666 --> 25:12.336
- Coming.
- Sit down, have a little coffee.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.046
Good morning, everybody.

25:14.254 --> 25:16.048
- Hi.
- Another full house, I see.

25:16.214 --> 25:19.885
Yes, and that robe is available
for purchase in the gift shop.

25:21.553 --> 25:22.846
- Hi.
- Good morning.

25:23.055 --> 25:28.477
- Oh, you found your ring.
- What? You knew it was gone?

25:28.685 --> 25:31.855
Well, Daphne, when your fiancée gives
you a hug with a chicken on her hand,

25:32.063 --> 25:33.857
then bells go off.

25:34.274 --> 25:35.901
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay, honey.

25:36.109 --> 25:37.402
I didn't wanna say anything.

25:37.611 --> 25:40.614
I knew it'd turn up sooner or later,
I didn't wanna make you feel worse.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.241
As long as we're tying up loose ends,
I was just wondering,

25:43.408 --> 25:45.785
what was your ring doing
on the edge of my Jacuzzi tub

25:45.994 --> 25:48.038
right next to my favourite
scented candle

25:48.246 --> 25:50.540
which was burned down
to the wick?

25:51.541 --> 25:54.544
I'm gonna let my attorney
handle this one.

25:56.338 --> 26:00.091
I'm sorry, Fras. You know,
I guess after a little champagne,

26:00.258 --> 26:03.428
we got into the mood and into the nude
and into the tub.

26:03.636 --> 26:06.806
So... And, you know, don't worry,
we'll replace the candle.

26:07.056 --> 26:09.517
If only you could replace the image.

26:11.978 --> 26:13.104
Next time, if you don't mind,

26:13.313 --> 26:15.273
would you just turn down
the temperature a little?

26:15.481 --> 26:17.192
Actually, we tried,
but the knob was stuck.

26:17.358 --> 26:20.361
Yeah, it does that.
You gotta jiggle it a little.

26:25.950 --> 26:30.246
Don't worry, it's not what you think.
We use it to give Eddie a bath.

26:32.749 --> 26:34.375
- Hey, guys, how are you doing?
- Hi, Dad.

26:34.584 --> 26:36.961
- Morning.
- Nice to see you.

26:44.177 --> 26:46.929
- Well, you're up early.
- You mean still up.

26:47.096 --> 26:50.683
- We never went to bed.
- We'll get there.

26:51.642 --> 26:54.729
- What'd you do all night?
- Oh, well, what didn't we do?

26:54.979 --> 26:56.147
We started off at a concert,

26:56.314 --> 26:58.190
a wonderful group
called Uncle Dirt Nap.

26:59.275 --> 27:02.028
Then we danced the night away
at every club in the U District

27:02.194 --> 27:04.071
before finding ourselves
at an after-party

27:04.238 --> 27:07.491
at Kit's friend, Massimo's place.
He's a squatter.

27:09.368 --> 27:11.495
Anyway, I wanted to give Kit
the keys to my building,

27:11.704 --> 27:13.998
and I have a spare set here,
so I thought we'd pop by.

27:14.206 --> 27:16.417
- Well, then let me get them for you.
- Thanks.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.336
I can offer you a pastry
courtesy of Le Cigare Volant.

27:19.545 --> 27:22.298
No, thanks. You know, those things
are loaded with bleached flour.

27:22.506 --> 27:25.009
That stuff's poison.

27:27.553 --> 27:29.930
Niles, give me your cell phone.
I'll call the travel agent.

27:30.097 --> 27:31.390
- Oh, you going on a trip?
- Yeah.

27:31.599 --> 27:33.934
He's taking me to France
for the weekend, Euro Disney.

27:36.145 --> 27:41.650
Massimo said we just had to go.
Apparently it is so lame it's cool.

27:42.234 --> 27:43.777
Well, I should get going.

27:44.486 --> 27:49.825
- Places to go, people to poison.
- I should get going too.

27:50.034 --> 27:52.494
I'll pick up Lady and meet you
and Eddie at the park at 10:30?

27:52.703 --> 27:55.372
- Better make it 11.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

27:55.581 --> 28:00.210
- Bye. Oh, bye, Bonnie.
- Bye, Frasier.

28:01.086 --> 28:05.215
- Frasier, isn't she great?
- Oh, yes.

28:06.925 --> 28:12.055
She's so free, so spontaneous.
She has breathed new life into me.

28:15.183 --> 28:17.686
You may have to return the favour.

28:20.439 --> 28:24.901
- Am I detecting disapproval?
- No, no, Niles, not at all. I'm just...

28:25.110 --> 28:29.322
Well, all right. Don't you think you two
are going just a bit quickly?

28:29.531 --> 28:31.908
For the past year, you've told me
I had to get over Daphne,

28:32.075 --> 28:34.578
find someone else. Now I do,
and all you can do is find fault?

28:34.786 --> 28:36.329
Man, you are such a buzzkill.

28:39.875 --> 28:42.961
Will you stop talking like that?
I'm just a little concerned, Niles.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.839
You met this girl last week
and she's spent every night with you.

28:46.006 --> 28:47.966
You're giving her the keys
to your apartment.

28:48.216 --> 28:49.509
I think you're just jealous.

28:49.759 --> 28:51.052
- Jealous?
- Yes.

28:51.303 --> 28:54.139
Here I have attracted
this untamed free spirit.

28:54.347 --> 28:55.974
You're saddled
with an uptight pastry chef

28:56.182 --> 28:57.392
whose name you can't remember.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.477
Her name is Faye.

29:01.146 --> 29:04.899
And I am not jealous,
I'm just a little worried about you.

29:05.108 --> 29:08.445
- I'm afraid you might get hurt.
- Oh, here we go.

29:08.611 --> 29:11.281
Whatever would I do
without my wise older brother

29:11.448 --> 29:12.449
to tell me what to do?

29:12.657 --> 29:14.617
Frankly, you couldn't be acting
more like a child.

29:14.826 --> 29:16.786
You think I don't know the reason
you came here?

29:16.995 --> 29:20.248
It wasn't to get your keys, it was
to show off Lolita's kid sister out there.

29:22.292 --> 29:24.711
The two of you have
absolutely nothing in common.

29:24.961 --> 29:28.381
- Well, we're all set for Euro Disney.
- Oh, great. You ready to go home?

29:28.548 --> 29:30.425
- Oh, sure. Bye, Frasier.
- Bye.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.343
Oh, I'm so excited for this trip.

29:32.552 --> 29:35.305
I'm gonna spend all my time
in Fantasyland.

29:35.513 --> 29:40.560
Oh, Niles, I'm sorry, I take it back.
You do have something in common.

29:55.783 --> 29:57.827
Isn't that a darling sight?

29:58.035 --> 30:00.705
Time was, when a waitress said,
"Can I warm that up for you,"

30:00.872 --> 30:02.748
she was talking about your coffee.

30:06.335 --> 30:08.546
How was your date with Bulldog
last night?

30:08.713 --> 30:10.006
Hideous.

30:10.256 --> 30:12.842
He took me to a nice restaurant,
he bought me flowers,

30:13.050 --> 30:15.511
and then we went back to his place
and cuddled.

30:15.678 --> 30:18.764
All I could think of the whole time was,
"How do I dump this loser?"

30:19.015 --> 30:20.474
Oh, Roz.

30:20.683 --> 30:23.769
He's meeting me here for coffee, and
I'm ending this thing once and for all.

30:24.019 --> 30:26.480
Yeah, well,
good luck getting a cup of coffee.

30:28.274 --> 30:31.861
You know, it's the funniest thing,
he really does look happy, doesn't he?

30:32.069 --> 30:34.363
- Yeah, so just leave it alone.
- Oh, maybe you're right.

30:34.572 --> 30:37.157
Do you realise that this is the first time
in recent history

30:37.366 --> 30:39.660
that all three Crane men
have been in happy relationships?

30:39.869 --> 30:43.789
Maybe I should be celebrating that fact
rather than being such a buzzkill.

30:45.457 --> 30:48.460
- What does that mean?
- Oh, Roz, plug in.

30:50.754 --> 30:52.131
Hi, honey, it's Frasier.

30:52.339 --> 30:56.719
Listen, I just read a marvellous review
of this charming boîte out in Fremont,

30:56.885 --> 31:00.305
and I thought to myself, "That is a
place that Cassandra would just love."

31:00.472 --> 31:01.473
- So...
- Frasier.

31:01.682 --> 31:04.143
- Not now, Roz, please...
- You just called her Cassandra.

31:04.893 --> 31:07.104
Oh, dear God, I'm...

31:07.729 --> 31:11.400
My producer, Roz, informs me
that I just called you Cassandra.

31:11.650 --> 31:14.236
I'm sorry,
I don't know why I keep doing this.

31:14.444 --> 31:19.241
I know that you're Faye.
Fabulous Faye. Forever Faye.

31:19.408 --> 31:21.451
Call me, Faye.

31:22.244 --> 31:24.663
It is one syllable.
What the hell is wrong with me?

31:26.248 --> 31:28.125
Well, I'm glad to see
that you think it's funny.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.501
No, I don't, I'm just...

31:29.710 --> 31:34.005
I'm having a flashback
to my summer of Ted, Todd and Tad.

31:35.716 --> 31:40.011
- Hey, sports fans.
- Bulldog, hi. You know what?

31:40.220 --> 31:42.889
You may have my seat.
I'm gonna sit over there.

31:43.056 --> 31:44.933
All right.

31:45.976 --> 31:46.977
Hey, gorgeous.

31:47.185 --> 31:49.646
You and I need to talk about
what's been going on between us.

31:49.896 --> 31:52.983
- I know.
- We're in public.

31:53.191 --> 31:57.320
Look, look, I wanna tell you
what's going on in here, okay?

31:57.529 --> 32:00.865
- Bulldog, I don't wanna know...
- No, Roz, I gotta be honest with you.

32:01.032 --> 32:03.326
This past week has been amazing.

32:05.245 --> 32:07.914
But I met a total babe
at Unemployment this morning

32:08.081 --> 32:11.000
and we're going to Hawaii
this afternoon.

32:11.918 --> 32:13.169
- What?
- I know, I know.

32:13.378 --> 32:15.004
Getting dumped, ouch,
it hurts like hell.

32:15.213 --> 32:17.674
No, no, I don't believe this.
I came here to dump you.

32:17.924 --> 32:20.927
Hey, whatever you gotta say
to get through this, it's okay with me.

32:21.136 --> 32:24.139
No, no, no, I know, I know. I didn't
mean to make you fall in love with me.

32:24.347 --> 32:28.393
- I didn't, you repulse me.
- Hey, love hurts, Roz.

32:28.643 --> 32:32.146
And I'm not talking about the time
we fell off the kitchen table.

32:32.355 --> 32:33.731
Aloha, old friend.

32:33.898 --> 32:37.944
Bulldog, you cuddle lousy
and I'm glad you got fired.

32:38.736 --> 32:43.533
- Well, timing is everything.
- Back off, buzzkill.

32:48.538 --> 32:50.498
- Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Dad.

32:50.665 --> 32:53.000
Black coffee to go, please.

32:53.209 --> 32:57.255
- You okay?
- I just broke it off with Bonnie.

32:57.463 --> 33:01.092
Oh, gee, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

33:01.926 --> 33:04.512
Lady humped Eddie.

33:07.265 --> 33:11.143
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. It was humiliating.

33:11.352 --> 33:16.232
Yeah, but Eddie's a boy dog
and Lady is, well, a lady.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.694
Yes, well, that would be
the humiliating part, now, wouldn't it?

33:19.860 --> 33:23.030
Right in his own park
in front of all these other dogs.

33:24.615 --> 33:26.867
Yeah, Bonnie got a big kick
out of it too.

33:27.076 --> 33:29.537
- Sorry.
- And I told her off, and that was it.

33:29.787 --> 33:31.414
Sorry, Dad.

33:31.664 --> 33:34.166
- It's not funny.
- I know, I know, I know.

33:34.583 --> 33:36.293
Was he wearing a hat?

33:38.128 --> 33:41.382
No, no, Dad, Dad, please,
come back, come on.

33:41.590 --> 33:43.551
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey, Faye.

33:43.759 --> 33:45.386
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

33:45.553 --> 33:48.722
I was near the station, so I thought
I'd just see if you were around.

33:48.889 --> 33:52.935
Well, great.
Oh, Roz, you remember Faye.

33:54.019 --> 33:55.020
Hi, Faye.

33:55.229 --> 33:57.439
You were going to say Cassandra,
weren't you?

33:57.648 --> 34:01.568
- Why would you think such a thing?
- Well, I just checked my messages.

34:01.819 --> 34:04.405
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why it keeps happening.

34:04.613 --> 34:06.323
You just have
this remarkable resemblance...

34:06.573 --> 34:08.534
I know, I know, your aunt.

34:10.077 --> 34:14.540
- I'll be right back.
- I have got to stop saying "Cassandra."

34:14.748 --> 34:18.252
- Frasier.
- Cassandra.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.504
- Hi, Roz.
- Hi, Cassandra.

34:21.004 --> 34:23.297
- So how have you been?
- Great.

34:23.549 --> 34:25.342
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a while.

34:25.550 --> 34:29.179
We've been sort of avoiding each other
at work, and it just all seems so silly.

34:29.429 --> 34:31.389
I mean, I really don't have
any hard feelings

34:31.556 --> 34:33.016
about the way things ended
between us.

34:33.266 --> 34:35.476
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
You know, neither do I.

34:35.686 --> 34:36.978
You dumped me.

34:37.187 --> 34:39.231
You're not allowed to have
hard feelings.

34:39.398 --> 34:40.524
Anyway, my life is great.

34:40.732 --> 34:42.775
- I'm back together with Sloane.
- Oh, well...

34:42.984 --> 34:44.777
You and I should have coffee
some time.

34:44.985 --> 34:45.987
That would be nice, yes.

34:46.196 --> 34:48.322
I'm glad we're putting
all this awkwardness behind us.

34:48.532 --> 34:50.158
Me too.

34:51.159 --> 34:54.329
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

34:57.207 --> 34:59.876
- Well...
- Whoa, I gotta get back to work.

35:00.043 --> 35:01.586
You going back to the station?

35:01.753 --> 35:03.296
- Yes.
- Good, I'll walk with you.

35:03.463 --> 35:05.590
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.
We better hurry.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.842
- Bye, Frasier. Bye-bye, Faye.
- Bye-bye, love you.

35:08.009 --> 35:09.552
Yes, you do.

35:11.471 --> 35:13.598
- Who was that?
- You know Roz.

35:13.848 --> 35:18.228
- No, no, no, the other one.
- Oh, she's the promotions director.

35:18.395 --> 35:20.605
- Yeah, well, she's gorgeous.
- Oh, you think so?

35:20.772 --> 35:23.942
- I never really looked.
- Well, don't start looking now.

35:26.236 --> 35:28.112
If I'm gonna stay,
I should feed the metre.

35:28.321 --> 35:30.198
Lucky metre.

35:32.784 --> 35:34.327
- Hey, there, Frasier.
- Oh, Niles, hi.

35:34.536 --> 35:38.122
Listen, Niles, I want to apologise
for getting upset this morning.

35:38.331 --> 35:39.707
I've been giving it some thought.

35:39.874 --> 35:42.710
I think maybe
Kit is just what the doctor ordered.

35:42.961 --> 35:45.338
Is she ever.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.090
And no strings, just fun, right?

35:47.298 --> 35:49.425
- That's what she said.
- Exactly.

35:49.676 --> 35:51.135
- So you really like her?
- Yes, I do.

35:51.344 --> 35:53.471
- And you're not just saying that?
- Absolutely not.

35:53.679 --> 35:55.306
You want her?

35:56.140 --> 35:58.810
- Excuse me?
- Frasier, she's killing me.

36:02.438 --> 36:05.525
I'm just not cut out for this lifestyle.

36:05.733 --> 36:07.610
Between seeing myself in a mirror
at the club

36:07.777 --> 36:09.654
dancing my modified Charleston

36:09.820 --> 36:13.074
and catching my reflection
in a store window this morning

36:13.241 --> 36:15.910
as I Rollerbladed past in spandex...

36:18.079 --> 36:21.082
...I feel like I'm being stalked
by some pathetic, middle-aged ghoul.

36:21.290 --> 36:24.210
I just... Obviously,
I've gotta break it off with her.

36:24.418 --> 36:28.964
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Niles.
You gonna tell her now?

36:29.215 --> 36:31.175
No, no, no,
I'll arrange to meet her after work.

36:31.425 --> 36:34.178
Tell you the truth,
I think she's losing interest herself.

36:34.387 --> 36:36.722
I couldn't help notice
a little eye-rolling today

36:36.931 --> 36:40.017
when my skate wheel got stuck
in a storm grate.

36:42.436 --> 36:45.856
And thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

36:46.398 --> 36:48.943
Hey, Kit, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about later.

36:49.151 --> 36:51.403
Just talk to me now.
You know you can tell me anything.

36:51.654 --> 36:53.447
Well, yeah,
I'd rather do it after your shift.

36:53.697 --> 36:55.324
You have such a serious face.

36:55.532 --> 36:58.535
What, are we breaking up
or something?

36:58.744 --> 37:00.287
Well...

37:01.080 --> 37:02.873
Oh, my God. You just dumped me

37:03.082 --> 37:05.459
right here where I work,
in front of everyone I wait on?

37:05.668 --> 37:08.003
- Okay, we'll go outside. It's...
- Why? Give me an answer!

37:08.253 --> 37:11.006
- Kit, Kit, calm down. It's all right.
- What, you're tired of me?

37:11.173 --> 37:12.424
- Is that what it is?
- No, no.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.259
- You've had enough of me?
- No, no, no.

37:14.843 --> 37:16.637
I gave you everything,
and you used me.

37:16.845 --> 37:18.889
- No, no, no, honey...
- Sex, sex, sex!

37:19.056 --> 37:21.892
The way you come to bed every night
wanting it, begging for it!

37:22.142 --> 37:24.811
- I never had to beg.
- I'm just a whore to you, aren't I?

37:25.062 --> 37:26.063
No, don't say that.

37:26.271 --> 37:29.775
Yes, I am. Your whore,
your whore from the café!

37:39.743 --> 37:42.829
It was really
more of a compatibility thing.

37:43.580 --> 37:45.874
I'm recently divorced
and I've been under a lot of strain.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.084
Niles, no.

37:47.292 --> 37:50.128
- It's been painful for everyone.
- They're strangers. It's all right.

37:50.295 --> 37:52.506
Let's just pick this up, shall we?

37:53.882 --> 37:55.425
Here, you take that, I'll get this.

37:55.634 --> 37:57.594
- What happened?
- I'm not really sure, actually.

37:57.803 --> 38:00.972
- Just give me a minute, will you?
- Excuse me, is Frasier still here?

38:01.139 --> 38:03.892
- I had something I needed to ask him.
- Oh, yeah, he's over there.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.810
I didn't get a chance
to meet you before.

38:06.019 --> 38:08.063
- I'm Faye.
- Oh, how do you do? I'm...

38:08.271 --> 38:12.817
No!

38:20.325 --> 38:22.786
Well, you know,
this is a charming little place.

38:22.994 --> 38:25.121
I live around the corner,
I've never been in before.

38:25.288 --> 38:26.414
What'll it be?

38:26.664 --> 38:31.836
Martini, straight up, two olives,
henceforth known as the usual.

38:34.464 --> 38:36.174
- Hey.
- Niles.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.926
I called Daphne.
She said you'd be here.

38:38.134 --> 38:40.595
- Oh, yeah.
- It's a cosy room.

38:40.803 --> 38:42.847
Guess it'll have to do,
because the old whoremonger

38:43.056 --> 38:45.099
won't be going back to Nervosa
any time soon.

38:46.601 --> 38:49.020
Yeah, I'm pretty much exiled
from Le Cigare Volant

38:49.228 --> 38:50.605
with Faye working there.

38:50.813 --> 38:53.024
- Well, I plan to get stinking tonight.
- Thank you.

38:53.232 --> 38:55.109
May I see your wine list?

38:58.321 --> 38:59.322
Hey, guys.

38:59.530 --> 39:01.157
- Dad.
- Dad. What are you doing here?

39:01.324 --> 39:04.494
Oh, saw Niles' car out front,
so I thought I'd stop in for a drink.

39:04.660 --> 39:07.497
I can't go to McGinty's anymore
with Bonnie there.

39:07.747 --> 39:10.249
And Eddie's taking a break
from the park.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.044
Well, come join us here on Elba.

39:13.294 --> 39:15.963
- What can I get you?
- Jameson's on the rocks.

39:16.172 --> 39:18.382
And I'll try the white.

39:21.719 --> 39:27.141
Well, here we are again,
losers in love.

39:27.642 --> 39:31.312
Yeah. You know, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.731
I seem incapable of maintaining
a relationship.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.985
I date a nice girl like Faye,
things seem to be working out.

39:38.152 --> 39:40.362
I seem to find a way to blow it.

39:42.364 --> 39:44.742
Seems to be the pattern of my life.

39:44.909 --> 39:48.579
Well, except with Lilith.
She was just nuts.

39:50.623 --> 39:55.169
Well, at least you take your time.
I don't date, I leap, headfirst.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.046
Thank you.

39:57.254 --> 39:59.548
More often than not,
I get my heart broken.

39:59.757 --> 40:00.966
By Maris.

40:04.303 --> 40:06.805
By Daphne,
even if she didn't know it.

40:07.014 --> 40:09.850
At least Kit only broke
my box spring.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.814
All I can conclude is that I must have
some deeper issues with women

40:15.981 --> 40:18.192
that manifest themselves
in my behaviour.

40:18.358 --> 40:21.445
- The trick is to pinpoint them.
- Well, you know what I'm thinking?

40:21.612 --> 40:24.781
I'm thinking of taking some time off
and going into deep analysis.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.617
That's not a bad idea, Niles.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.869
You know, Steven Bachman
is at the absolute pinnacle

40:29.077 --> 40:31.205
of psychodynamic research.
Perhaps we should see him.

40:31.455 --> 40:33.916
If we went in together,
we could get a rate.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.376
- Shouldn't take more than a year.
- That's optimistic.

40:36.543 --> 40:40.422
Jeez, how do you guys get up
in the morning?

40:41.715 --> 40:44.384
You wanna go into deep analysis?
Listen to me, I'm your father,

40:44.593 --> 40:46.553
there's nothing wrong
with either one of you.

40:46.928 --> 40:48.972
You dump a woman,
but can't get her off your mind,

40:49.181 --> 40:50.724
so you get dumped by the other one.

40:50.932 --> 40:54.102
And you should've stayed with
the first one anyway, she was hotter.

40:54.311 --> 40:56.354
And you, you're just learning
how to date.

40:56.563 --> 40:58.607
It would've been nice
if it happened 25 years ago,

40:58.815 --> 41:00.776
but you play the cards you're dealt.

41:01.318 --> 41:03.278
Me, I like Bonnie,

41:03.487 --> 41:07.407
Bonnie's dog humps Eddie,
I don't like Bonnie anymore.

41:08.617 --> 41:11.620
Doesn't mean I have issues
with women, it's just life.

41:11.828 --> 41:14.998
You know, good stuff happens
and bad stuff happens, that's all.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.627
You just gotta look on the bright side.
It's like that old song:

41:18.835 --> 41:21.588
<i>You gotta accentuate the positive</i>

41:22.672 --> 41:27.302
Maybe Dad's right.
We do tend to overanalyse things.

41:27.469 --> 41:31.598
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?

41:31.848 --> 41:33.641
Let's go over here.
Let's do a little singing.

41:33.850 --> 41:35.310
- Dad, no.
- No, come on.

41:35.518 --> 41:37.896
Hey, buddy, can you play
"Accentuate the Positive"?

41:38.104 --> 41:42.484
Oh, no, I'm just noodling around.
The real pianist doesn't come till 9.

41:42.734 --> 41:45.028
Oh, well...
Well, you can fake it, can't you?

41:45.236 --> 41:48.323
Well, no, not really.
I actually only know three songs.

41:48.573 --> 41:51.326
"America the Beautiful,"
"Happy Birthday," and "Goldfinger."

41:51.534 --> 41:53.786
- That's all right, buddy.
- No, no, no, come on, guys.

41:53.995 --> 41:56.914
We were gonna sing a happy song,
let's sing a happy song, come on.

41:57.165 --> 41:58.207
Play "Goldfinger."

41:58.416 --> 42:00.209
- We don't know the words to that.
- No.

42:00.376 --> 42:02.920
You knew it when you were kids.
It'll cheer you up. Come on.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.338
- Hit it.
- All right.

42:12.096 --> 42:13.097
Goldfinger.

42:13.347 --> 42:15.308
<i>Goldfinger</i>

42:15.516 --> 42:17.477
He's the man,
the man with the Midas touch.

42:17.727 --> 42:21.856
<i>He's the man
The man with the Midas touch</i>

42:22.064 --> 42:23.274
A spider's touch.

42:23.524 --> 42:25.318
<i>A spider's touch</i>

42:25.526 --> 42:26.611
Such a cold finger.

42:26.819 --> 42:28.613
- Dad, this is ridiculous.
- Come on, sing it.

42:28.821 --> 42:32.867
<i>Such a cold finger</i>

42:33.743 --> 42:37.663
<i>Beckons you to enter his web of sin</i>

42:37.872 --> 42:39.332
That's it.

42:39.498 --> 42:42.501
<i>But don't go in</i>
