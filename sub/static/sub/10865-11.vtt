Show and tell time.
Gary?

00:31.560 --> 00:35.160
An autographed picture
of Harry Houdini.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.520
This bracelet belonged
to my great-grandmother.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.920
A Hank Aaron rookie card.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.680
The poems of
Edgar Allan Poe,

00:48.680 --> 00:51.840
printed in the 1800s.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.160
Uh...

00:53.160 --> 00:54.680
I didn't bring anything.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.840
Why not?

00:55.840 --> 00:58.280
I just didn't, all right?
This is lame!

00:59.280 --> 01:00.560
What did you bring?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.480
What's so special
about that?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.960
I asked you guys to bring

01:07.960 --> 01:09.800
the most valuable thing
you owned.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.560
My father gave this to me
when I was 2.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.360
It's been next
to my bed ever since.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.680
Weak! That isn't
worth anything!

01:16.680 --> 01:18.360
Maybe not to you,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.640
but there's different
kinds of value.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.000
Would you guys trade
any of your stuff?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.600
Forget it.
No way.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.400
It depends on
what I'm trading for.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.800
OK. What if you were
trading for your life?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.840
Everything has value.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.120
Everything
has a price.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.640
In my story,

01:36.640 --> 01:38.640
you have to make sure
the price you pay

01:38.640 --> 01:41.200
doesn't turn out to be
more than you bargained for.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.080
Submitted for the approval

01:45.080 --> 01:47.840
of the Midnight Society,

01:47.840 --> 01:49.200
I call this story...

01:57.080 --> 01:58.160
Yes!

01:59.200 --> 02:00.120
Excellent, Sue.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.080
Thanks.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.280
Great job.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.520
Keep at it, Catherine.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.720
Nice try, Cat.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.560
You'll get it next time.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.720
Thanks.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.080
How'd you do?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Fourth.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
That's great!

02:39.080 --> 02:40.080
Out of 5.

02:40.080 --> 02:40.840
Oh.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.640
Another average performance
from average old Catherine.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.720
So, it's not your event.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.120
You can still
make the team.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.120
As what,
the bus driver?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.560
Sorry about that.
You OK?

02:52.560 --> 02:54.840
Oh, uh--yeah.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.000
Wow, what a fox.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.360
Fox? Since when are
you checking out guys?

03:04.360 --> 03:06.520
Since I stopped being
your baby sister.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.600
Wake up.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.040
Come here.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.120
..."Kazakhstan,"

03:18.120 --> 03:21.080
"Uzbekistan?"

03:21.080 --> 03:23.520
Oh, I can't
remember them all.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.440
Why can't they just
call it plain old Russia,

03:26.440 --> 03:29.040
one country
and one name?

03:29.040 --> 03:30.240
Try using
a mnemonic.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.640
Yeah, right, something
else to remember?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.640
No, it helps
you remember.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.040
How?

03:36.040 --> 03:36.790
OK.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.520
Imagine...

03:39.520 --> 03:42.040
Imagine a man
standing on a Turkey.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.040
You get turk-man-
and stand.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.440
Hey, that's cool.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.680
Will it help me remember
stuff I left in my locker?

03:49.680 --> 03:50.840
What?

03:50.840 --> 03:52.520
I left my social studies
book at school.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.200
I'll see you
at home. OK?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.200
[Rumbling sound]

04:54.240 --> 04:55.960
I've been
waiting for you.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.600
See anything you like?

05:01.480 --> 05:02.440
Yeah, sure.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.000
You have some nice...

05:04.000 --> 05:07.880
I have exactly
what you need.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.480
Look closer.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.960
Uh--no,
I gotta be going.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.000
These?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.680
These will
help you fly,

05:19.680 --> 05:22.640
fly like you've
never flown before.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.360
How did you know?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.440
My name is Marie.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.200
I've been
where you are.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.680
I know what it's
like to feel average.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.680
And I'd like
to help.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.520
I don't have any money.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.840
Well, then perhaps
a trade.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.160
Mmm,

05:43.160 --> 05:46.080
your ring would add
nicely to my collection.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.400
I can't.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.960
It was a gift
from my grandfather.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.880
It's the only
valuable thing I have.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.920
Really?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.360
Well then,
I'll take something

06:01.360 --> 06:02.760
that has
no value to you.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.360
Like what?

06:05.360 --> 06:07.360
Should it matter?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.880
If it has
no value to you,

06:08.880 --> 06:10.560
you won't miss it.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.880
You want to be the best,

06:14.880 --> 06:16.360
don't you?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.960
There we go.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.280
[Giggling]

06:54.000 --> 06:55.920
Did I make the cut?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.640
Make the cut?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.880
Keep that up and
I'll make you captain.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.160
That was great. I didn't know
you had that kind of speed.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.600
How'd you do it?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.720
I don't know.
I just...

07:09.880 --> 07:11.320
How'd I do it?

07:11.320 --> 07:13.960
I'm fast and you're slow.
That's how I did it.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.240
So, looks like you're not
as special as you thought.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.840
I knew
you could do it.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.320
I'm glad
somebody believes in me.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.840
Help me with
my social studies later?

07:30.840 --> 07:31.920
You got it.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.040
Ah!

07:35.040 --> 07:36.840
What's the matter?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.440
Look at my face!

07:39.880 --> 07:40.960
Yeah, so?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.600
Can't you see it?

07:42.600 --> 07:43.680
See what?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.680
N-nothing.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.960
I guess
it was nothing.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.120
Don't stress. You made
the team, remember?

07:58.120 --> 08:00.160
Yeah, right.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.560
I'm sorry.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.520
Hey, hi.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.440
We keep running
into each other.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.440
Yeah. Hi.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.320
I saw you run
the other day.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.760
Man, you're quick.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.960
Thanks.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.320
I'm on
the soccer team,

08:26.320 --> 08:28.600
so we'll probably be
seeing a lot of each other.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.960
That'll be fun.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.760
I mean, yeah.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.880
I'll try not to
run you over again.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.360
Maybe after practice,
we could...

08:39.360 --> 08:40.559
Hi, Eric.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.919
So, we still on
for tonight?

08:42.919 --> 08:44.000
Absolutely.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.040
Everything
is your size.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.600
[Giggles]

09:25.600 --> 09:27.560
I hope you like
the selection.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.760
How'd you know
I'd be back?

09:33.760 --> 09:35.760
I told you.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.160
I've been
where you are.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.520
It felt good to win
today, didn't it?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.240
You'd like to
impress the boy,

09:47.240 --> 09:48.640
wouldn't you?

09:56.840 --> 10:00.040
I still have my eye
on that ring.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
I can't.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.480
It means too much to me.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.640
I never even
take it off.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.760
Then I'll take something
that means nothing to you.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.240
Like what? You didn't
take anything before.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
[Giggles]

10:19.240 --> 10:21.280
Oh, you think so.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.800
But...

10:22.800 --> 10:25.160
Shall we make
the trade?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.320
[Laughs]

10:55.720 --> 10:57.080
It's beautiful.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.760
When did
you go shopping?

10:58.760 --> 11:00.440
Come on, concentrate.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.920
When was the commonwealth of
the independent states created?

11:03.920 --> 11:06.320
I know that, 1991.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.680
Right.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.520
What's the second
largest Soviet State?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.680
Uh--hint?

11:11.680 --> 11:13.560
It starts with a "U".

11:13.560 --> 11:15.520
One more teeny hint.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.960
It's the U-kraine...

11:22.040 --> 11:24.040
You don't know it,
do you?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.120
Uh--guess I don't.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.440
I guess
you're just stupid.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.480
What?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.280
Where are you going?
We were having fun.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.480
Fun?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.040
Tutoring an idiot?

11:36.040 --> 11:39.440
Go to the library and help
yourself and leave me alone.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.280
[Laughter of woman]

12:12.160 --> 12:13.160
Hi, guys.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.000
Hey,
you look great.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.760
Where'd you get
the clothes?

12:16.760 --> 12:18.880
No place special.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.400
What are
you guys up to?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.840
Sue's friend
can get us tickets

12:22.840 --> 12:23.520
to the Blaster
concert.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.520
Wow, really!

12:24.520 --> 12:25.680
I thought
they were sold out.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.440
Actually, we're
gonna go get 'em now.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.800
Do you want to come?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.400
Yeah, sure.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.360
Um--my friend said he
could only get 2 tickets.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.480
Oh.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.440
Oh, yeah. Um...

12:37.440 --> 12:38.960
That's OK.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.400
Have fun.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Hey, Sue.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.000
What?

12:52.520 --> 12:54.920
You know the stuff I said
the other day after the race?

12:54.920 --> 12:57.160
Yeah.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.640
Nothing.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.680
Forget it.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.520
[Bell ringing]

13:24.280 --> 13:27.400
I can give you everything
you want, Catherine.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.800
And you do want
things, don't you?

13:32.120 --> 13:34.320
Of course you do.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.480
I was beautiful
once, too.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.280
But now.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.920
Surely, there must be
something more you want.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.680
Perhaps these.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.560
For the concert.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.400
The very last ones.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.680
Everyone wants them.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.400
But you can have them,
Catherine.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.600
Wouldn't that
make you special?

14:17.480 --> 14:18.600
No.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.680
I don't want them.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.200
Sorry.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.800
Hey, whoa.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.280
That's 3 times.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.920
I think there's some sort
of fate going on here.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.800
You know, I never
really met you,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.480
and now you're
everywhere I turn.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.680
Sorry.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.440
No, don't be sorry.
I kinda like it.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.880
Really?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.280
Yeah.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
Eric?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.720
Do you like the Blasters?

15:05.720 --> 15:08.240
Like 'em?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.880
I spent all night
sleeping outside

15:09.880 --> 15:11.560
trying to
get tickets.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.000
All I got
was a cold.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.880
Maybe you want
to go tonight...

15:15.880 --> 15:17.280
with me.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.760
Where'd
you get those?

15:19.760 --> 15:20.800
I got a source.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.560
Of course!

15:22.560 --> 15:24.360
For sure.
I mean, yeah.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.520
Great. I'll pick
you up at around 9:00?

15:26.520 --> 15:27.680
Is that OK?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.040
I can't wait.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.480
All right.
Excellent. Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:45.920
You're really lucky.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.680
Everybody thinks
Eric's cute.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.400
Can I help?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.560
That looks good.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.720
How would you know?

15:54.720 --> 15:57.960
I have nothing to wear!

15:57.960 --> 16:00.520
What's wrong with what you
have on? You look great.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.480
Are you crazy? Eric's
already seen me in this.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.600
Where are you going?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.000
None of your business.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.120
I've been
waiting for you.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.240
Take anything you want.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.440
Take it all.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.480
[Giggles]

16:37.440 --> 16:38.840
Don't you want to trade?

16:38.840 --> 16:44.000
Me? I'm about to get
exactly what I want.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.160
[Laughs]

17:04.319 --> 17:07.000
Can't you knock?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.160
Catherine?

17:09.160 --> 17:09.880
Joyce?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.240
I know your secret.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.079
What secret?

17:15.079 --> 17:16.560
Don't give me that.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.760
I followed you.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.480
I know
all about Marie.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.240
Joyce, you know
nothing about Marie.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.160
I know that she gives
you stuff for free.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.760
It is not for free!

17:30.920 --> 17:32.440
Joyce, you've gotta
give that stuff back.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.360
Why? So you can have
Marie all to yourself?

17:35.360 --> 17:37.520
You're so selfish,
Catherine.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.840
You've always
been selfish.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.880
Well now, it's time
to get what I want.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.880
Enjoy your date.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.760
[Marie's laughter]

18:07.360 --> 18:10.720
Do you have
everything you want now?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.720
I know I do.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.960
[Laughing]

18:17.520 --> 18:20.240
Everything comes
with a price.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.320
Catherine? Catherine,
honey, Eric's here.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.360
Catherine?

18:35.640 --> 18:36.960
I'm not ready yet, Mom.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.240
Maybe you should
sit down, Eric.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.720
You've gotta
listen to me.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.640
Catherine,
what's happening?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.080
I don't want the clothes.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.720
I don't want to
go to the concert,

18:59.720 --> 19:01.400
or be on the track team.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.480
I want things
to be like before.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.840
[Marie laughing]

19:04.840 --> 19:06.480
I'm afraid
it's too late.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.240
Marie?

19:08.240 --> 19:10.120
What happened?

19:10.120 --> 19:13.120
I told you,
I've been where you are.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.520
I wasn't happy
with who I was either.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.120
Until I found this stall,

19:20.120 --> 19:25.320
and a strange woman who
gave me anything I wanted...

19:25.320 --> 19:27.080
for a price.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.240
I didn't know
what I was giving up.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.120
I should have seen what was
happening in the mirror,

19:33.120 --> 19:34.920
but I didn't
until it was too late.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.960
You said you wanted things
that didn't mean anything to me.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.960
I wanted what you thought
had no value, and I got it.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.680
What was it?

19:44.680 --> 19:46.920
I took your life.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.880
My life?

19:48.880 --> 19:52.360
Now it's your turn
to find some greedy girl

19:52.360 --> 19:55.160
who feels
sorry for herself.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.320
It won't be hard.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.200
All you have to do
is get her to

20:00.200 --> 20:01.760
give you her life.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.680
Wait.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.680
Maybe I do deserve
this, but Joyce doesn't.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.560
Please
leave her alone.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.680
Why should I?

20:11.680 --> 20:13.920
I have everything
I want now.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.880
Not everything.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.440
You wanted this.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.040
Isn't it the most
valuable thing you own?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.640
I used to think so.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.320
Not anymore.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.400
Only if you promise to
give Joyce's life back.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.480
I promise.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.520
I always get what I want.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.000
No.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
This is--this is wrong!

21:07.000 --> 21:08.520
This is not supposed
to happen this way.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.280
What's happening?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.320
No.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.400
No! That's not fair!

21:16.400 --> 21:18.640
Wait! No!

21:18.640 --> 21:21.800
No, it's not fair! No!

21:21.800 --> 21:22.920
No!

21:33.560 --> 21:34.640
Look.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.840
Are you OK?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.920
Yeah.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.360
I'm fine.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.480
What happened
to Marie?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.280
I think
she wanted too much.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.520
And I wanted what counts.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.080
I'm sorry. This
just isn't like her.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.600
That's OK.
Good night.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.640
Good night.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.400
Oh!

22:11.160 --> 22:12.360
Sorry I'm late.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.840
You were up...

22:13.840 --> 22:15.080
Come on, Mom. I need some
help with my homework.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.000
You ever
hear of memonics?

22:19.440 --> 22:20.960
Is everything OK?

22:22.280 --> 22:24.200
Yes...

22:24.200 --> 22:25.400
And no.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.400
I lost the tickets.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.520
I'm sorry.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.200
OK.
No problem.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.640
Then uh...

22:35.640 --> 22:37.880
Maybe we could
just go for a walk.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.520
Really?

22:43.520 --> 22:45.080
You're not mad?

22:45.080 --> 22:47.400
No. I just wanted
to get to know you.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.520
There's
not much to know.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.120
I'm really
pretty average.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.400
Somehow, I doubt that.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.520
The end.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.040
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society

23:11.040 --> 23:12.120
closed.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.040
Hey Sam, wait up.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.560
Did you like
the story?

23:19.560 --> 23:21.200
Yeah, it was great.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.080
Why didn't
you bring anything?

23:24.080 --> 23:25.520
'Cause I didn't.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.240
But you said
you were going to.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.480
Everybody brought
this really cool stuff.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.960
Mine was so stupid,
I didn't show it.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.320
What is it?

23:35.320 --> 23:36.560
Don't laugh.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.000
His name's Moby.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.080
A goldfish?

23:42.080 --> 23:44.400
Your most valuable
thing is a fish?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.720
Quiet, they'll think
I'm a geek.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.520
Hey guys, wait'll
you see this!

23:47.520 --> 23:49.200
Tucker, you're dead.
