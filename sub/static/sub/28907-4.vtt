We can clean it up and sell it
and make some money.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.220
We could go a little bit
further than that

06:32.220 --> 06:34.890
and make a really kick-ass car
that may or may not break out,

06:34.890 --> 06:39.060
or we can make a car that
make people go, "holy [bleep]."

make this riviera badass.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.030

on the line every day here.

and shorter.

rest on our laurels.

and spend our time

A build of this magnitude,
it really deserves a year,

if not more.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.560
Getting it done in months and
putting it out there at sema?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.800
That's asking for trouble.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.060
This is all about upping
gas monkey as a brand.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.600

the next evolution.

that we're here to stay

We push all the time, we gotta
get up to that next level.

Can we play with the color
a little bit?

07:31.610 --> 07:32.710
Mike:
Maybe not green, not black.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.350
Everybody's gonna
expect green out of us.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.650
Okay, I will give you my word,
we won't do green or black.

Richard: This riviera build
is gonna be big.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.620

sounds like a long way off,

07:42.620 --> 07:46.160

I'm putting 300k into a car.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.730

This is a $300,000 build.

go draw something up.

I mean, if we're gonna
do this thing,

07:52.470 --> 07:54.230
I need to have some kind
of design for us to go off of.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Let me go get started.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.710
Richard's idea is to bring
corvette cues into the riviera,

08:04.710 --> 08:07.250
and now I have to figure out
how to combine those two things,

08:07.250 --> 08:09.550
corvette and riviera,
and make it something

08:09.550 --> 08:12.490
that's practical
and possible to build.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.860
300k? That's a lot of money.
But five months?

08:14.860 --> 08:17.690
That's not really a lot of time
for a project that needs

08:17.690 --> 08:19.190
as much care and detail
as this one.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.600
Everyone has their doubts,
but when sema rolls around,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.030
one way or another,
we're gonna find out

08:23.030 --> 08:24.600
if richard bit off
more than we can chew.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.470
Five months is not
very long at all.

But hey, we're gonna be
camping out a lot.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.940
and we're really
already under the gun.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.810
This car has, like, these
natural hips right here

15:14.810 --> 15:16.340
and I think we should
accentuate that.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.780
And, you know,
one of richard's ideas

15:17.780 --> 15:20.310
was to take the corvette cues
and bring them into the riviera,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.450
so I was thinking a vent there
for a break vent,

15:22.450 --> 15:23.720
I think that's
a really cool idea.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.290
It'll naturally fit there.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.190
I came up with a name
for the car.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.420
Uh-oh.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.660
I wanna call it
the battleship buick,

15:29.660 --> 15:30.920
because it's gonna be
battleship gray

15:30.930 --> 15:32.360
and it's a mean boattail car.
-I don't hate it.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.660
I don't hate it.
-I don't hate that at all

15:33.660 --> 15:36.200
brian: This car being
a boattail buick riviera,

15:36.200 --> 15:37.660
it's a big ol' boat,
it's a land yacht,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.630
but we're making it
into a performance car.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.570
That makes it a
battleship in my eyes.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.670
Somebody needs to talk about
the elephant in the room,

15:43.670 --> 15:45.770
and I'm not talking
about jeremy.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.770
Damn.
What else is it?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.410
What is it?
Time.

15:48.410 --> 15:51.440
Five months, but we
have other projects

15:51.450 --> 15:53.180
in that time, too.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.850
Technically we're probably
only really getting,

15:54.850 --> 15:57.480
what, two months, three, maybe?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.550
I think this might be one of
the most fab heavy projects

15:59.550 --> 16:00.850
that gas monkey has ever done,

16:00.860 --> 16:02.290
and we're gonna
be under the gun,

16:02.290 --> 16:03.290
and we have to work
together to get this done.

16:03.290 --> 16:04.490
Every one of us has to chip in

16:04.490 --> 16:06.090
and get the fabrication
side of this thing.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.530
What do you think
you need time wise

16:07.530 --> 16:08.760
as far as body?

16:08.760 --> 16:09.960
This body's pretty straight.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.660
There'll be heavy mods,
but as far as --

16:11.670 --> 16:12.970
three weeks,
give me three weeks.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.300
Three weeks? Have you ever
had three weeks

16:14.300 --> 16:16.100
to paint a car before?
-No, that's what I'm saying.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.470
Have y'all ever had five months
to do metal work?

16:17.470 --> 16:19.240
-No.
-All right, three weeks.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.970
We're breaking new ground here.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.140
-Give me three weeks.
-All right, three weeks.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.080
I've built a couple
sema cars before,

16:24.080 --> 16:25.550
and there's definitely a crunch,

16:25.550 --> 16:29.150
but five months from the get-go,
from coming up with an idea?

16:29.150 --> 16:31.150
I know these guys work fast,
but it's gonna be a tight --

16:31.150 --> 16:32.420
a tight squeeze.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.590
What are we looking
at power point-wise?

16:33.590 --> 16:36.290
Super charged, lt-4, chevy.

16:36.290 --> 16:39.060
1,000, 1,200 horse power
is what I'm hearing.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.230
-[ laughs ]
-lotta gear.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.490
Yeah, that's awesome.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.660
All that horse power means
that the original chassis

16:42.660 --> 16:43.860
is headed for the scrap pile.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.330
We'll need a new chassis,

16:45.330 --> 16:47.930
a custom one that's not only
stronger, but lighter,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.200
and specifically designed,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.500
so we can mount
the independent suspension.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.970
This is gonna be
a super expensive build.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.810
This is gonna be
the most expensive build

16:54.810 --> 16:56.040
we've ever built
at gas monkey.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.580
And our most ambitious build.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.680
Not only is this just
gonna take a lot of time,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.050
it's also gonna
take a lot of money.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.550
Richard seems to be
okay with it right now,

17:02.550 --> 17:05.050
but I can foresee four,
five months down the line,

17:05.050 --> 17:06.520
richard may not be quite as okay

17:06.520 --> 17:08.120
with how much money we're
spending on this car.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.520
I actually saw some moths
fly out of richard's wallet,

17:10.530 --> 17:11.720
like he's getting into parts

17:11.730 --> 17:12.730
he's never actually
got into before.

17:12.730 --> 17:13.960
[ laughs ] yeah.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.460
The biggest issue
is that the chassis

17:15.460 --> 17:16.900
has to be built first,
and that's gonna take some time.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.300
So in the meantime, I tackle
all the heavy body mods,

17:19.300 --> 17:20.830
and then really,
when the chassis comes in,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.100
we'll be ready to set the body
on it and go to town.

17:23.100 --> 17:27.040
[ laughing ]
-let's go to work.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.210
I gotta go wash my hands.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.540
â™ª

17:30.550 --> 17:32.780
-tony: I think that's it.
-Mike: I think so, too.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.980
We got snacks, drinks.
Let's do this.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.350
Road trip!

17:36.350 --> 17:42.020
â™ª

17:42.020 --> 17:45.660
hey. Why do I need all this
stuff for my first day?

17:45.660 --> 17:46.890
I'm doing social media.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.060
Oh, super cool.
I forgot you were coming.

17:48.060 --> 17:50.700
Come on.
-How'd you forget I was coming?

17:50.700 --> 17:52.870
'cause I don't really pay
attention to you very often.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.800
-That's about right.
-Sinjin, my boy, I love ya,

17:54.800 --> 17:56.370
but the world don't
revolve around you.

17:56.370 --> 17:57.800
It revolves around me.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.110
-You ready?
-Yeah.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

18:01.610 --> 18:03.610
-What?
-Got a prize for you guys.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.550
You probably didn't even
know this, but I have a stepson.

18:05.550 --> 18:09.020
What? What the [bleep]?
I mean, where do I even start?

18:09.020 --> 18:10.420
A stepson?
-[ chuckles ]

18:10.420 --> 18:11.880
I've been here for,
like, five years,

18:11.890 --> 18:13.420
and this is the first
I've ever heard

18:13.420 --> 18:14.950
of richard rawlings
having a stepson.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.960
He's gonna handle some
social media stuff, so...

18:17.960 --> 18:19.660
Okay, so is he gonna
follow us or what?

18:19.660 --> 18:22.330
-Nope. He's gonna ride with ya.
-In<i> this</i> van?

18:22.330 --> 18:23.530
Richard: Yep. Get in there.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.130
But there's not even
a seat for me!

18:25.130 --> 18:26.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.600
You got your camera
and your cellphone, right?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.770
-Yeah.
-All right, go.

18:28.770 --> 18:31.570
-Why is he going with us?
-Get on in.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.740
Trial by fire.
-That's not even...

18:32.740 --> 18:33.940
Sleep with your back
to the wall,

18:33.940 --> 18:35.780
and if you get in
trouble, don't call me.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.640
-What's that smell in here?
-Y'all good to go.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.980
His name's sinjin.
-Sinjin?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.950
Yeah, don't worry
about the definition.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.120
I don't
understand it either.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.380
-Is he indian?
-I don't know.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.650
-Does he have money?
-Nope.

18:44.650 --> 18:45.850
Why's he gotta go
with us though?

18:45.850 --> 18:48.590
900 miles without a/c,
that's already bad enough,

18:48.590 --> 18:50.190
and now we got
little richard?

18:50.190 --> 18:51.860
[ scoffs ] whatever.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.000
-Mike: Sinjin, huh?
-Yeah.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.700
-Well, I'm mike.
-Okay.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.730
And snitches get
stitches in this van.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.300
You understand that, right?
-Richard: Hey, come on.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.970
Snap, snap!
You gotta get to indy!

19:03.970 --> 19:05.670
Come on, snap it up!
-Are you supposed to rat us out?

19:05.670 --> 19:08.940
No.
I was supposed to do my job.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.140
Mike:
There goes our plans.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.110
Richard: All right, man,
get social media.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.480
Click, bing, take pictures,
have fun.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.350
If he doesn't do good,
leave him there.

19:17.350 --> 19:18.520
-Mike: Oh, we will.
-Oh, we'll leave him there,

19:18.520 --> 19:20.850
that's for sure.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.420
His mom said, "give him a job."
I gave him a job.

19:23.420 --> 19:26.690
That's your introduction to
my stepson, sinjin venegas.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.490
Now I married his mom
when he was 3.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.600
He just graduated
university at arkansas,

19:30.600 --> 19:31.900
but he's a typical millennial.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.370
He's, like, "I don't know
what I wanna do.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.370
Maybe I wanna do some
social media stuff."

19:35.370 --> 19:38.140
well, we do some social media
stuff here at gas monkey,

19:38.140 --> 19:40.240
so threw him in the truck
with those bozos,

19:40.240 --> 19:42.380
and he's on his way to indy.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.880
[ laughs ]
should be good for them.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.980
Sucks for you, bro.
I'm gassy.

19:46.980 --> 19:49.380
[ laughter ]

19:49.380 --> 19:50.850
[ engine revs, tires peal ]
-richard: Whoo!

19:50.850 --> 19:52.650
Narrator: Coming up on
"fast n' loud,"

19:52.650 --> 19:55.220
can richard afford to keep
this build afloat?

19:55.220 --> 19:57.160
I never thought I'd be so
happy to spend so much money.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.360
â™ª yeah! â™ª

19:58.360 --> 20:01.890
narrator: And custom chop
or ultimate flop?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.800
-Did it work?
-Dude, that looks hideous.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.030
â™ª

20:06.030 --> 20:07.770
what?

20:14.040 --> 20:18.540
â™ª

20:18.550 --> 20:19.810
richard: This has to work.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.610
Chris alston, he's not
expecting us to show up,

20:21.620 --> 20:23.150
and this is the guy
that can build our chassis.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.380
I mean, chris is awesome.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.890
I got jeremy and russell
with me today --

20:25.890 --> 20:27.620
jeremy because he's
my fabricator,

20:27.620 --> 20:29.620
and russell...Well, it doesn't
hurt to have his muscle

20:29.620 --> 20:31.720
on my team when he's not busy
on "garage rehab."

20:31.730 --> 20:33.230
he didn't tell me
"no" on the phone.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.490
It'll be hard for him
to say "no"

20:34.500 --> 20:35.660
when the three of us
walk in there.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.200
Well, I'm not going
anywhere else

20:37.200 --> 20:39.530
and I'll pay a little extra
money, but we gotta have it.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.400
Do you want me to
new york strong arm him?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.140
I don't know.
How's that work?

20:43.140 --> 20:45.000
Well, I can't tell you that.
All right, here we are.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.470
Richard: I talked to
chris alston on the phone

20:46.470 --> 20:49.310
about building us a chassis,
and he was like, "get in line."

20:49.310 --> 20:51.640
so I figured showing up with
jeremy, my fabrication guy,

20:51.650 --> 20:53.180
and russell, the muscle,

20:53.180 --> 20:55.650
he'd get the message that
we seriously need his help.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.880
Remember --
upbeat and positive.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.120
-I'm excited.
-We need this.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.690
-Wow.
-This is amazing.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.720
Richard: If you're a serious
hot roder, drag racer,

21:04.730 --> 21:08.130
or what have ya, chris' chassis
are your first choice.

21:08.130 --> 21:10.060
We've used chris alston before.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.530
Like, when we built
the hi-po hauler.

21:12.530 --> 21:13.830
What's going on, sir?
Richard rawlings.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.000
Chris alston.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.900
I'm chris alston,
and this is my company,

21:16.900 --> 21:18.640
chris alston's chassisworks.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.170
I know you told me that
you have a lot of people

21:20.170 --> 21:21.410
in front of us on the line,

21:21.410 --> 21:22.440
and you couldn't
make the time frame,

21:22.440 --> 21:23.910
but I really need it done,

21:23.910 --> 21:25.380
and I don't wanna go
anywhere else.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.550
I mean, you guys are the best.
-Well, I appreciate that.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.450
The big thing about
getting this chassis

21:28.450 --> 21:29.650
is not only getting
the one that we want

21:29.650 --> 21:30.920
done by the people
that we know can do it,

21:30.920 --> 21:32.320
but we gotta take this car
to sema.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.190
That's my main goal,
and I wanna make sure

21:34.190 --> 21:36.920
that we have the best
components in it at all times.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.990
Well, let's just blow up
the picture and take it to sema,

21:38.990 --> 21:41.530
'cause building that thing is
gonna really be hard.

21:41.530 --> 21:42.960
We just gotta get parts.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.560
We need you to come
through with what we need.

21:44.570 --> 21:45.930
Anything's possible.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.600
It just takes money.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.500
There's the guy.
There he is.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.810
The fact that they want
this thing done by sema

21:52.810 --> 21:58.410
is a huge, huge, huge
unbelievably difficult project.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.750
If you really wanna step up
and spend some major coin,

22:01.750 --> 22:03.850
then we're the place to be.
-[ laughing ]

22:03.850 --> 22:05.850
I wouldn't have flown out
here if I wasn't ready.

22:05.850 --> 22:06.950
This way.
All right.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.990
Let's do it.
So far, so good.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.460
Chris is taking us to
see the merchandise,

22:10.460 --> 22:12.260
and I take that as a sign
he might do business.

the style of chassis

22:17.030 --> 22:18.460
we're talking about.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.400
This is called our
perimeter x frame.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.740
It has a x in the middle, and
these perimeter frame rails.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.470
For your riviera, it would
look exactly like this.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.410
It'll be a little bit wider,
and the frame rails

22:28.410 --> 22:29.780
in the back will be longer.

22:29.780 --> 22:33.180
It allows you to build
a really bitchin' chassis

some way to accommodate

You think we should take this

24:52.320 --> 24:53.820
Yeah, I think so.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.820
I think that leverage,
if we start cutting stuff,

and the rockers

24:57.120 --> 24:59.760
on the structural parts and...
-Yeah.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.030
I think it's better
a little lower, too,

25:01.030 --> 25:02.190
because we ultimately,
we need to start

25:02.200 --> 25:03.460
chopping the top, like, now.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.960
Since the '70s, rivi is back
in the sand blaster,

25:04.970 --> 25:06.470
there's no better time than now,

25:06.470 --> 25:08.000
to keep the ball rolling
on what will hopefully be

25:08.000 --> 25:10.200
gas monkey's most ambitious
build ever.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.000
And even though sema's
not for five more months,

25:12.010 --> 25:13.240
we still have
a bunch of other builds

25:13.240 --> 25:15.410
we're gonna be doing
at the same time.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.680
So, bass, what are we
thinking on planning

25:16.680 --> 25:18.140
on cutting the roof?

25:18.150 --> 25:19.350
We're just taking some of
the forehead out of this car.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.450
We're making
the windshield shorter.

25:20.450 --> 25:21.650
I'd like to start with an edge.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.880
I think that's a good idea.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.120
And I think we have
to cut it out up here,

25:24.120 --> 25:25.680
and then maybe bi-cut it
down here to pull it down.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.650
Do a little bit to get
that aggressive look

25:27.660 --> 25:29.820
and then, you know, make
it as minimal as possible.

25:29.820 --> 25:35.790
â™ª

25:35.800 --> 25:37.260
typically, whenever you start
to build a car,

25:37.270 --> 25:38.530
you start with the foundation.

25:38.530 --> 25:39.870
The foundation is the chassis.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.170
We don't have the chassis yet,

25:41.170 --> 25:42.470
because we ditched
the original riviera chassis

25:42.470 --> 25:43.640
and decided to go with a new one

25:43.640 --> 25:44.970
from chris alston's
chassissworks.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.310
The problem is
we don't have it yet,

25:46.310 --> 25:48.240
and we're already under the gun
as far as time goes,

25:48.240 --> 25:50.180
so we had to make a new plan.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.580
Figure out a way to move
forward with the car

25:51.580 --> 25:53.210
without having the chassis here.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.850
Right now we're gonna chop
the top on the riviera

25:54.850 --> 25:56.850
to hopefully lower
the roof by an inch.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.050
Typically when you chop a top,

25:58.050 --> 25:59.750
you take the top
and cut it completely off,

25:59.750 --> 26:02.290
and you take a little
piece out, put it back on,

26:02.290 --> 26:04.620
and weld it together.
Well, we're not doing that here.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.990
What we're doing here is
basically creating, like,

26:06.990 --> 26:09.560
a hinge, so rather than take it
off, move it like this,

26:09.560 --> 26:11.330
we're taking it and
moving it like that.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.770
So we're getting rid of the big,
tall front windshield look,

26:14.770 --> 26:16.870
refining it a little bit
to make the shape of the car

26:16.870 --> 26:20.570
a little bit more level as
opposed to a backwards slant.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.780
A chop top is the one thing
that makes a hot rod a hot rod.

the way back to the late '30s.

and racing on dry lake beds.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.560
The original chop top
was solely for speed.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.670
With he riviera chop, we're
more interested in style.

We want the window line
to come down more,

26:48.340 --> 26:49.840
this door line's also
gonna go up,

26:49.840 --> 26:52.240
so it's gonna visually look
like it's going down.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.180

27:04.620 --> 27:07.150

geometry of the rivi in place,

27:07.150 --> 27:08.350

of the c pillar to make a

27:17.700 --> 27:19.200
We need to cut right
in this area here,

The desire for this
low roofline goes way back

31:04.460 --> 31:06.190
our designers back then
drew low rooflines,

31:06.190 --> 31:08.160
and they looked fantastic.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.360
But manufacturers, well,
they were more conservative,

31:10.360 --> 31:13.070
and they raised the roof to
accommodate drivers' headgear,

31:13.070 --> 31:14.630

Well, in a nod to those
art deco-inspired designers,

31:22.440 --> 31:24.710

this is the one case

31:32.550 --> 31:34.250

are warranted

in the wheel well,
but at least we get an idea

38:47.920 --> 38:49.590
of how it's gonna look.

38:49.590 --> 38:51.320
And if this mock-up
is any indication,

38:51.330 --> 38:52.990
it's gonna be badass.

38:52.990 --> 38:55.290
That's about right height
right there.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.590
Tucked in the lip.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.330
-[ sighs ] okay.
-Excited?

38:59.330 --> 39:00.970
It looks good, though.
It really does.

39:00.970 --> 39:02.330
I think it looks good.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.640
Brian: But now we've done
just about everything we can

39:03.640 --> 39:05.070
until the chassis gets here.

39:05.070 --> 39:07.510
Sema may seem like months away,
but that clock is ticking.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.370
We got tons of work
left ahead of us.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.310
That's a whole lotta tire.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.980
But it's a whole lotta car, too.

39:13.980 --> 39:17.080
â™ª

39:17.080 --> 39:18.880
richard: When we got rolling
on the '72 riviera,

39:18.890 --> 39:20.520
I wasn't kidding when
I said it was gonna be

39:20.520 --> 39:22.250
a superbuild
worth taking to sema,

39:22.260 --> 39:24.660
and that's gonna take time
<i> and</i> money.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.460
Now $300,000?
That is a lot of money.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.130
But five months ain't a lot of
time, not for this car build.

39:30.130 --> 39:31.700
Why is everybody
standin' around?

39:31.700 --> 39:33.730
Well, we're talkin'
about the next step.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.170
Makin' good progress.

39:35.170 --> 39:36.870
Progress does look good,
but we got a problem.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.370
Chris alston chassisworks
just called, and we gave 'em

39:39.370 --> 39:40.940
a tall order -- I knew it
when we went in --

39:40.940 --> 39:43.410
and it's
a little bit delayed.

39:43.410 --> 39:44.680
Delayed?

39:44.680 --> 39:46.040
It's a little bit, like,
not delayed.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.210
We're supposed to be getting it
like next week, right?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.550
Not comin' and it's not
their fault.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.720
Give us the bad news.
How late is it gonna be?

39:50.720 --> 39:51.920
Two weeks.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.020
-Later? Later?
-So a month.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.490
A month from right now?

39:55.490 --> 39:56.720
Yeah, this isn't somethin' that
was sittin' in the computer

39:56.720 --> 39:57.990
they could punch out.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.020
Last year we had
two amazing vehicles at sema,

40:00.030 --> 40:01.290
and that was a huge deal.

40:01.290 --> 40:02.930
I mean, it was
a lot of pride.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.160
Everybody seemed to
really love what we did,

40:05.170 --> 40:06.560
and this is taking it
to the next step.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.930
We have to be at sema.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.200
Yeah, that's where
this car has to be.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.440
Do they have any part of it?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.900
Do they have
a rear end assembly?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.440
I kinda went down that
rabbit trail with him,

40:13.440 --> 40:15.810
but the problem is, is if
you remember the old thing

40:15.810 --> 40:17.480
where they started in the east
and started in the west

40:17.480 --> 40:18.740
and built the railroads
and missed.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.810
I don't wanna do that
from front to back.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.050
Brian: We made as much
progress as we can

40:22.050 --> 40:23.550
without having the chassis.

40:23.550 --> 40:25.150
We can't fabricate parts now
without having foundation

40:25.150 --> 40:26.680
of the build.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.190
Richard said we'd be workin'
other cars at the same time,

40:28.190 --> 40:30.320
but that time came a
little sooner than I hoped.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.790
It would be a huge
disappointment

40:31.790 --> 40:33.630
if we didn't have this car
there, at least if not for us

40:33.630 --> 40:35.130
but for our manufacturers
that are helping us

40:35.130 --> 40:36.290
with this project.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.760
Well, I told him,
we're aiming for sema

40:37.760 --> 40:40.170
but it's a production,
it's a vehicle,

40:40.170 --> 40:42.370
and if we make it,
we make it.

40:42.370 --> 40:43.800
People wanna see this thing,
I think, ya know?

40:43.800 --> 40:45.140
People are talkin'
about it on the net.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.600
-Right.
-They know we're buildin' it.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.240
They're wonderin' what
we're doin' with a '72 riviera,

40:48.240 --> 40:49.510
but the talk's there.

40:49.510 --> 40:51.210
The countdown clock to sema
is ticking,

40:51.210 --> 40:52.710
but we don't have a choice.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.650
We've got to set the riviera
aside and wait for parts.

40:54.650 --> 40:55.850
Sorry for the bad news.

40:55.850 --> 40:57.980
Just push all the [bleep]
together and...

40:57.980 --> 40:59.450
Let's do something else.

40:59.450 --> 41:02.490
What a buzzkill, dude.
I was having a good time.

41:02.490 --> 41:03.790
Well, there you go.

41:03.790 --> 41:06.660
So tryin' to get to sema
and, you know, things happen.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.130
Those guys are tryin' to
get to sema, too,

41:08.130 --> 41:11.000
so everybody's on board,
nobody's doin' anything wrong,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.600
we just time and money,
time and money.

41:13.600 --> 41:19.300
â™ª

41:19.310 --> 41:21.110
-let's knock it out.
-Narrator: Still ahead

41:21.110 --> 41:24.040
on this season on
"fast n' loud,"

41:24.040 --> 41:26.380
even as richard brings in
fresh projects,

41:26.380 --> 41:29.310
the clock is ticking down
on the riviera's "superbuild."

41:29.320 --> 41:30.920
how long until the frame's
put together?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.780
Narrator: The monkeys will face
new challenges

41:32.790 --> 41:36.490
on their biggest, baddest,
most expensive build ever.

41:36.490 --> 41:38.260
You'll just have to bring
a wheelbarrow full of hundreds.

41:38.260 --> 41:39.720
A wheelbarrow.

41:39.730 --> 41:43.090
Narrator: Catch every episode
to follow the buick riviera...

41:43.100 --> 41:44.330
We're goin' to katech.

41:44.330 --> 41:47.000
...As it's transformed
from giant land yacht...

41:47.000 --> 41:48.230
Check it out, richard.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.470
Super rad!

41:49.470 --> 41:51.240
...Into the ultimate
gentleman's hot rod.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.900
There's a lot more riding
on this riviera build

41:52.910 --> 41:54.370
than the 300k that
I'm puttin' into it.

41:54.370 --> 41:55.870
Did I just say "300k"?

41:55.880 --> 41:57.040
