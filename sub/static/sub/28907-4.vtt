really time consuming,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.940
and we're really
already under the gun.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.810
This car has, like, these
natural hips right here

15:14.810 --> 15:16.340
and I think we should
accentuate that.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.780
And, you know,
one of richard's ideas

15:17.780 --> 15:20.310
was to take the corvette cues
and bring them into the riviera,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.450
so I was thinking a vent there
for a break vent,

15:22.450 --> 15:23.720
I think that's
a really cool idea.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.290
It'll naturally fit there.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.190
I came up with a name
for the car.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.420
Uh-oh.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.660
I wanna call it
the battleship buick,

15:29.660 --> 15:30.920
because it's gonna be
battleship gray

15:30.930 --> 15:32.360
and it's a mean boattail car.
-I don't hate it.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.660
I don't hate it.
-I don't hate that at all

15:33.660 --> 15:36.200
brian: This car being
a boattail buick riviera,

15:36.200 --> 15:37.660
it's a big ol' boat,
it's a land yacht,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.630
but we're making it
into a performance car.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.570
That makes it a
battleship in my eyes.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.670
Somebody needs to talk about
the elephant in the room,

15:43.670 --> 15:45.770
and I'm not talking
about jeremy.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.770
Damn.
What else is it?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.410
What is it?
Time.

15:48.410 --> 15:51.440
Five months, but we
have other projects

15:51.450 --> 15:53.180
in that time, too.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.850
Technically we're probably
only really getting,

15:54.850 --> 15:57.480
what, two months, three, maybe?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.550
I think this might be one of
the most fab heavy projects

15:59.550 --> 16:00.850
that gas monkey has ever done,

16:00.860 --> 16:02.290
and we're gonna
be under the gun,

16:02.290 --> 16:03.290
and we have to work
together to get this done.

16:03.290 --> 16:04.490
Every one of us has to chip in

16:04.490 --> 16:06.090
and get the fabrication
side of this thing.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.530

you need time wise

16:07.530 --> 16:08.760

but as far as --

16:11.670 --> 16:12.970
three weeks,
give me three weeks.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.300
Three weeks? Have you ever
had three weeks

16:14.300 --> 16:16.100
to paint a car before?
-No, that's what I'm saying.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.470
Have y'all ever had five months
to do metal work?

16:17.470 --> 16:19.240
-No.
-All right, three weeks.

I've built a couple
sema cars before,

16:24.080 --> 16:25.550

16:25.550 --> 16:29.150

from coming up with an idea?

16:29.150 --> 16:31.150

but it's gonna be a tight --

16:31.150 --> 16:32.420

at power point-wise?

Super charged, lt-4, chevy.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.490
Yeah, that's awesome.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.660
All that horse power means
that the original chassis

16:42.660 --> 16:43.860
is headed for the scrap pile.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.330
We'll need a new chassis,

16:45.330 --> 16:47.930
a custom one that's not only
stronger, but lighter,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.200
and specifically designed,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.500
so we can mount
the independent suspension.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.970
This is gonna be
a super expensive build.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.810

And our most ambitious build.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.680
Not only is this just
gonna take a lot of time,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.050
it's also gonna
take a lot of money.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.550
Richard seems to be
okay with it right now,

is any indication,

38:51.330 --> 38:52.990
it's gonna be badass.

That's about right height

-Excited?

38:59.330 --> 39:00.970
It looks good, though.
It really does.

39:00.970 --> 39:02.330
I think it looks good.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.640
Brian: But now we've done
just about everything we can

39:03.640 --> 39:05.070
until the chassis gets here.

Sema may seem like months away,

39:07.510 --> 39:09.370
We got tons of work
left ahead of us.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.310

on the '72 riviera,

39:18.890 --> 39:20.520
I wasn't kidding when
I said it was gonna be

39:20.520 --> 39:22.250
a superbuild
worth taking to sema,

39:22.260 --> 39:24.660
and that's gonna take time
<i> and</i> money.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.460
Now $300,000?
That is a lot of money.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.130
But five months ain't a lot of
time, not for this car build.

39:30.130 --> 39:31.700
Why is everybody
standin' around?

39:31.700 --> 39:33.730
Well, we're talkin'
about the next step.

Progress does look good,

Chris alston chassisworks
just called, and we gave 'em

39:39.370 --> 39:40.940

when we went in --

39:40.940 --> 39:43.410

a little bit delayed.

39:43.410 --> 39:44.680
Delayed?

It's a little bit, like,
not delayed.

We're supposed to be getting it
like next week, right?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.550
Not comin' and it's not
their fault.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.720

How late is it gonna be?

39:50.720 --> 39:51.920
Two weeks.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.020
-Later? Later?
-So a month.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.490
A month from right now?

39:55.490 --> 39:56.720
Yeah, this isn't somethin' that
was sittin' in the computer

39:56.720 --> 39:57.990
they could punch out.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.020
Last year we had
two amazing vehicles at sema,

40:00.030 --> 40:01.290
and that was a huge deal.

40:01.290 --> 40:02.930
I mean, it was
a lot of pride.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.160
Everybody seemed to
really love what we did,

40:05.170 --> 40:06.560
and this is taking it
to the next step.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.930
We have to be at sema.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.200
Yeah, that's where
this car has to be.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.440
Do they have any part of it?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.900
Do they have
a rear end assembly?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.440
I kinda went down that
rabbit trail with him,

40:13.440 --> 40:15.810
but the problem is, is if
you remember the old thing

40:15.810 --> 40:17.480
where they started in the east
and started in the west

40:17.480 --> 40:18.740
and built the railroads
and missed.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.810
I don't wanna do that
from front to back.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.050
Brian: We made as much
progress as we can

40:22.050 --> 40:23.550
without having the chassis.

40:23.550 --> 40:25.150
We can't fabricate parts now
without having foundation

40:25.150 --> 40:26.680
of the build.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.190
Richard said we'd be workin'
other cars at the same time,

40:28.190 --> 40:30.320
but that time came a
little sooner than I hoped.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.790
It would be a huge
disappointment

40:31.790 --> 40:33.630
if we didn't have this car
there, at least if not for us

40:33.630 --> 40:35.130
but for our manufacturers
that are helping us

40:35.130 --> 40:36.290
with this project.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.760
Well, I told him,
we're aiming for sema

40:37.760 --> 40:40.170
but it's a production,
it's a vehicle,

40:40.170 --> 40:42.370
and if we make it,
we make it.

40:42.370 --> 40:43.800
People wanna see this thing,
I think, ya know?

40:43.800 --> 40:45.140
People are talkin'
about it on the net.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.600
-Right.
-They know we're buildin' it.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.240
They're wonderin' what
we're doin' with a '72 riviera,

40:48.240 --> 40:49.510

We've got to set the riviera
aside and wait for parts.

40:54.650 --> 40:55.850
Sorry for the bad news.
