he just looked like a man.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.452
[ Howls ]

10:19.452 --> 10:21.188
He loved to tell jokes.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.391
And he didn't even care that
nobody else understood them.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.660
I mean, the average person
would be like,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.361
"Nobody's laughing at my jokes.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.363
Maybe I should stop
telling them."

10:30.363 --> 10:31.899
But he never did.

10:31.899 --> 10:36.236
Apollo: I can hear you,
you [bleep]

10:36.236 --> 10:39.907
