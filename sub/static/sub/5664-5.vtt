00:13.782 --> 00:16.350
In one mile, stay to the right...

00:18.119 --> 00:20.421
Just charged this thing.

00:34.369 --> 00:37.438
Are you okay? Hey, you...?

00:49.852 --> 00:51.319
This is not personal.

01:00.195 --> 01:02.163
Run.

01:31.860 --> 01:35.162
Eternal rest is for unimportant men.

01:52.915 --> 01:56.284
The king requires your service.

01:56.285 --> 01:58.686
Will you answer his call...

01:58.687 --> 02:00.621
General Howe?

02:08.396 --> 02:10.465
Where?

02:10.466 --> 02:13.334
You've arrived in Sleepy Hollow, my lord.

02:13.335 --> 02:15.870
Raise your men,

02:15.871 --> 02:19.507
make the Patriot scum afraid again.

02:19.508 --> 02:22.210
Afraid of Britain,

02:22.211 --> 02:24.579
afraid of her dead.

02:24.580 --> 02:27.582
I offer you vengeance on a hated enemy

02:27.583 --> 02:30.051
who once tried to end your life.

02:30.052 --> 02:31.886
Crane.

02:40.629 --> 02:42.597
There you are, all up in your faces.

02:42.598 --> 02:44.365
You missed the spare.

02:45.534 --> 02:48.102
I'm more used to bowling on turf.

02:49.404 --> 02:50.938
That would spare me these shoes.

02:50.939 --> 02:52.340
I look like an Italian circus performer.

02:52.341 --> 02:54.141
At least the shoes make it seem like

02:54.142 --> 02:56.143
you bothered to wear a costume at all.

02:56.144 --> 02:57.512
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

02:57.513 --> 02:58.779
I mean, I know you have
a look and everything,

02:58.780 --> 02:59.981
but come on, today's the one day you get

02:59.982 --> 03:01.382
to change it up a bit.

03:01.383 --> 03:03.618
Is it not obvious?

03:04.419 --> 03:07.021
I'm John Adams.

03:07.756 --> 03:09.223
The weskit.

03:09.224 --> 03:10.758
Brushed brocade and French buttons.

03:10.759 --> 03:12.226
It was his sartorial signature.

03:13.762 --> 03:15.763
I spent all night on this embroidery.

03:15.764 --> 03:17.031
I totally see it.

03:17.032 --> 03:18.532
It's unmistakable.

03:20.736 --> 03:22.770
Speaking of embroidery,

03:22.771 --> 03:24.372
isn't Hoop Dreams over there the one

03:24.373 --> 03:26.474
helping you with your
citizenship application?

03:26.475 --> 03:29.543
Oh, Miss Corinth.

03:30.679 --> 03:32.079
Yes.

03:36.718 --> 03:38.519
Oh, come on, Crane.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.087
Go.

03:44.226 --> 03:45.793
Ichabod. Well, hello.

03:45.794 --> 03:48.029
Miss Corinth, what a pleasant surprise.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.931
I love the brocade waistcoat.

03:49.932 --> 03:51.666
Very John Adams.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.234
Thank you.

03:53.235 --> 03:54.602
You like?

03:54.603 --> 03:57.138
Yes, you look effervescent.

03:58.407 --> 04:01.242
Uh... you are...

04:01.243 --> 04:03.144
Needle and thread champ.

04:04.246 --> 04:05.479
I'm Betsy Ross.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.847
Of course you are.

04:06.848 --> 04:08.583
Unmistakable.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.985
Well, with a little spice thrown in.

04:10.986 --> 04:13.187
Not that she was boring, but
I mean, you know, seamstress.

04:13.188 --> 04:16.223
I'm sure she would've
approved wholeheartedly.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.459
Bowl a frame with me later?

04:19.461 --> 04:21.228
You can rely on it.

04:31.473 --> 04:32.973
Ooh, swagger.

04:34.209 --> 04:35.643
You still think Halloween isn't fun?

04:35.644 --> 04:38.746
The Celts believed All Hallows' Eve

04:38.747 --> 04:40.247
to be a sacred time

04:40.248 --> 04:42.316
when the souls of lost loved ones

04:42.317 --> 04:44.619
walked the earth and
were honored with prayer,

04:44.620 --> 04:47.655
not face paint and molasses-based

04:47.656 --> 04:48.789
faux blood.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.791
But miniskirts and blue eyes get a pass.

04:52.995 --> 04:54.295
When in Rome.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.735
Ah... Lieutenant.

05:00.736 --> 05:03.204
On our trip to Washington, Dr. Brennan

05:03.205 --> 05:04.905
arranged to transport
General Howe's remains

05:04.906 --> 05:07.675
- to the Historical Society.
- Yeah.

05:07.676 --> 05:09.110
Almost made it for the drive

05:09.111 --> 05:10.511
and Agent Booth's charming personality.

05:10.512 --> 05:12.279
The thing is...

05:12.280 --> 05:16.150
the courier company claims
the body never arrived.

05:27.696 --> 05:29.930
Cody, we need more eggs.

05:29.931 --> 05:31.065
Get them yourself.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.602
Guys, look.

05:34.603 --> 05:36.570
Come on.

05:39.174 --> 05:41.642
Don't make me go all by myself.

05:41.643 --> 05:43.978
This is awesome.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.552
This is so cool.

05:53.555 --> 05:57.391
Damn, when I die, book me a suite in here.

05:57.392 --> 06:00.594
You can't afford it, bro.

06:10.872 --> 06:13.074
Okay. I'm over this.

06:13.075 --> 06:14.942
Let's go.

06:16.478 --> 06:18.479
Oh, God.

06:19.648 --> 06:22.183
Who the hell are you?

06:22.184 --> 06:24.618
Screw this.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.717
No sign of the driver.

06:59.718 --> 07:00.811
Or Howe.

07:01.284 --> 07:04.487
Why steal a 200-year-old skeleton?

07:04.488 --> 07:06.644
A lot of skid marks,

07:06.645 --> 07:08.946
like the driver was
trying to avoid something.

07:11.616 --> 07:13.451
Or someone.

07:13.452 --> 07:15.953
Pandora.

07:17.522 --> 07:20.724
What would she want with Howe's remains?

07:20.725 --> 07:22.960
Tracks are headed that way.

07:30.902 --> 07:32.870
Feel like hunting?

07:44.416 --> 07:46.550
I know this place.

07:46.551 --> 07:50.087
The British employed it as a staging ground

07:50.088 --> 07:52.223
during the invasion of Manhattan.

07:52.224 --> 07:54.158
Afterwards, we built that mausoleum

07:54.159 --> 07:56.493
to house their dead soldiers.

07:56.494 --> 07:59.262
Looks like someone came
to pay their respects.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.367
As fun as it is bumping into Zoe,

08:03.368 --> 08:05.168
they have these things now called dates

08:05.169 --> 08:06.436
you can actually plan in advance.

08:06.437 --> 08:09.372
Yes, I'm perfectly aware of that.

08:09.373 --> 08:12.208
Miss Corinth and I are
not romantically entangled.

08:12.209 --> 08:14.377
Mm. Maybe you're not allowing yourself

08:14.378 --> 08:16.879
to get entangled.

08:17.848 --> 08:20.283
You refer to Katrina?

08:20.284 --> 08:22.552
Yes. No matter what you became in the end,

08:22.553 --> 08:24.254
you cared about her.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.222
I mean, you two...

08:26.223 --> 08:28.257
Six years.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.062
We were husband and wife for six years.

08:34.865 --> 08:37.000
She taught me strength,

08:37.001 --> 08:39.802
resilience,

08:39.803 --> 08:42.705
how to properly iron my vests.

08:44.241 --> 08:46.476
Ghosts of the past have power over us.

08:46.477 --> 08:48.344
Even if we truly want to move on,

08:48.345 --> 08:50.446
it's not that easy.

08:51.649 --> 08:53.583
Yes, well...

08:53.584 --> 08:56.252
that chapter of my life is now closed.

09:00.424 --> 09:02.392
What on earth?

09:29.520 --> 09:30.954
My God.

09:32.390 --> 09:34.391
Ichabod Crane!

09:34.392 --> 09:35.592
General Howe.

09:35.593 --> 09:37.527
Give us the names!

09:40.431 --> 09:41.398
Take them!

09:55.012 --> 09:56.947
Isn't that great.

09:57.582 --> 09:59.683
Get them!

10:04.989 --> 10:06.723
After them, you dogs!

10:59.978 --> 11:03.945
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

11:31.451 --> 11:33.171
Mills. What's up?

11:33.172 --> 11:34.706
I was hoping you would tell me.

11:34.707 --> 11:37.542
I'm not sure what you mean.

11:37.543 --> 11:39.410
Since you moved into this office,

11:39.411 --> 11:40.979
you haven't closed the door.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.480
Not until this morning anyway.

11:42.481 --> 11:43.982
And then there are the two

11:43.983 --> 11:45.783
assistant U.S. attorneys in the lobby.

11:45.784 --> 11:47.585
And you know, you drop
your voice a half step

11:47.586 --> 11:50.321
- when you lie.
- I was just waiting on the right moment.

11:50.322 --> 11:52.690
Looks like this is it.

11:52.691 --> 11:55.860
It's an ongoing investigation
I've been working.

11:55.861 --> 11:57.528
Kind of takedown that makes a career.

11:57.529 --> 12:00.965
Shell companies buying
property across Westchester,

12:00.966 --> 12:04.502
all owned by one umbrella
LLC... Court Imports.

12:04.503 --> 12:08.473
Though on paper, a high-end
importer of rare antiquities.

12:08.474 --> 12:10.141
But the lion's share was actually looted

12:10.142 --> 12:13.177
from sites in Syria, Afghanistan, Iran.

12:13.178 --> 12:15.313
They're buying items stolen by terrorists.

12:15.314 --> 12:17.649
I'm still getting the warrants airtight.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.117
Hence, the lawyers.

12:19.118 --> 12:20.985
Oh.

12:20.986 --> 12:23.621
But when the time comes, how
does "Task Force Coordinator"

12:23.622 --> 12:25.790
- sound?
- Sounds good.

12:29.295 --> 12:33.398
I've got to say, an operation this size...

12:33.399 --> 12:36.701
you'd have to pull me away
from some of my other duties.

12:36.702 --> 12:40.338
I'm sorry if it cuts into
time with your roommate.

12:40.339 --> 12:43.775
I think you know where
my priorities lie, sir.

12:43.776 --> 12:46.444
Let's talk later?

12:46.445 --> 12:48.746
Mm.

13:03.362 --> 13:06.063
Give us the names!

13:09.802 --> 13:12.058
Just talked to SHPD.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.427
They're calling the
cemetery death accidental.

13:14.428 --> 13:15.796
Some kind of prank gone wrong.

13:15.797 --> 13:17.964
Nothing in Washington's Bible,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
Franklin's notebook.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.968
Even Grace Dixon's journal yields nothing

13:21.969 --> 13:24.871
that could explain the
desecration we witnessed.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.473
We'll find something. We always do.

13:29.510 --> 13:31.478
You are having a moment.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.547
Although we ended as enemies,

13:33.548 --> 13:37.117
William Howe was once a man
who commanded my respect.

13:37.118 --> 13:39.286
Before the war, I served
beneath him as lieutenant

13:39.287 --> 13:41.221
in His Majesty's forces.

13:41.222 --> 13:43.824
Howe was a keen war strategist.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.226
Staunchly loyal to his men

13:46.227 --> 13:47.961
and his country.

13:47.962 --> 13:49.963
He was honorable,

13:49.964 --> 13:51.965
a good man.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.568
Who sent a whispering wraith
against you and your spy ring,

13:54.569 --> 13:56.403
pushed you to betray Washington.

13:56.404 --> 13:59.272
Maybe he was once a
great man, but he changed.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.408
Which is why Washington
sent me to kill him.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.545
It was one of the darker
periods of the war.

14:05.546 --> 14:07.547
The invasion of Manhattan,

14:07.548 --> 14:10.050
when the British forces
under Howe's command

14:10.051 --> 14:13.920
took control of the city,
forcing the Patriots to retreat.

14:16.090 --> 14:19.426
Leave. I'll do this myself.

14:19.427 --> 14:21.428
In the early hours,

14:21.429 --> 14:23.930
Howe and his men commandeered
a townhouse belonging

14:23.931 --> 14:27.033
to a Patriot.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.877
Stealth was always your strong suit, Crane.

14:36.878 --> 14:38.745
Washington chose his man well.

14:38.746 --> 14:42.082
I do not wish to kill you,
but this invasion ends now.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.018
Order your men off the
island, and you shall live.

14:45.019 --> 14:46.803
And trust the word of a turncoat?

14:46.804 --> 14:49.472
Does dear old George know you
were within a hair's breath

14:49.473 --> 14:51.073
of turning against him?

14:51.074 --> 14:54.076
Perhaps in sending you
to terminate my command,

14:54.077 --> 14:55.645
he was testing your loyalties.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.647
The question is, can you do it?

14:57.648 --> 14:59.682
Kill a man in cold blood?

14:59.683 --> 15:01.984
I've made my choice.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.887
My allegiance is to this nation.

15:06.390 --> 15:09.825
All your kin fought for the king.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.395
You spit on their graves.

15:15.298 --> 15:17.366
I shall ask only once.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.935
Will you retreat?

15:21.838 --> 15:24.273
Answer me.

15:24.274 --> 15:25.975
I will never retreat

15:25.976 --> 15:30.146
until every last Colonial
dog lies in a grave.

15:30.147 --> 15:33.282
Do what you came to do, or leave

15:33.283 --> 15:36.619
before I have you clapped in irons!

15:37.754 --> 15:40.523
May God have mercy on us both.

15:46.063 --> 15:47.329
Shoot him.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.500
A moment later, I would
have pulled the trigger,

15:51.501 --> 15:52.935
and we might have held the city.

15:52.936 --> 15:54.336
Without Howe's command,

15:54.337 --> 15:55.838
the war could have ended sooner,

15:55.839 --> 15:58.340
sparing catastrophic bloodshed.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.746
Instead, I failed in my mission.

16:03.747 --> 16:06.582
What if there was another reason

16:06.583 --> 16:08.884
why Washington sent you to kill Howe?

16:08.885 --> 16:11.987
All right, you said he was unpacking
something when you found him.

16:11.988 --> 16:13.556
Yes. Uh...

16:13.557 --> 16:16.892
A stone with a Nordic emblem.

16:16.893 --> 16:20.162
A man with two swords thrust through him.

16:20.163 --> 16:22.298
In other words, a dead man walking.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.601
There is a volume

16:25.602 --> 16:30.039
that belonged to Washington
himself and, yes...

16:30.040 --> 16:33.809
And if I'm not mistaken...

16:33.810 --> 16:35.444
Here.

16:35.445 --> 16:38.414
Draugur, a rare breed of

16:38.415 --> 16:40.916
undead warrior who swear
an oath of duty in life

16:40.917 --> 16:43.385
- that lasts beyond death.
- Sounds like a bum deal.

16:43.386 --> 16:44.854
The Draugur are nocturnal,

16:44.855 --> 16:47.089
spending their days subterranean.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.692
Said to be unstoppable.

16:51.294 --> 16:53.896
What's this in the margins?

16:55.232 --> 16:58.267
It's Washington's handwriting.

17:00.370 --> 17:02.738
"All our methods built inside

17:02.739 --> 17:06.142
house primal tomb, his secrets lie."

17:06.143 --> 17:08.243
"Methods" meaning how
to defeat the Draugur.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.980
The answer must be in Howe's tomb.

17:10.981 --> 17:12.647
The team from the
Jeffersonian discovered it

17:12.648 --> 17:14.550
in Philadelphia, dated 1812.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.519
But this riddle mentions a primal tomb,

17:16.520 --> 17:18.621
meaning Howe was interred
somewhere else first.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.656
Question is, how do we find it?

17:21.657 --> 17:24.059
How about these?

17:24.060 --> 17:27.195
Howe's bones from the mausoleum.

17:27.196 --> 17:28.597
FBI forensics can carbon-date them,

17:28.598 --> 17:30.166
provide a soil analysis,

17:30.167 --> 17:32.701
narrow down to location.

17:32.702 --> 17:34.703
So Howe is the quarry,

17:34.704 --> 17:37.940
but we both know the architect
of this scheme is Pandora.

17:40.043 --> 17:43.512
She wants to raise fear, and
she has chosen the perfect night.

17:43.513 --> 17:45.414
Halloween.

17:45.415 --> 17:47.650
The whole town will be on the street.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.418
If we don't stop these Draugur by then,

17:49.419 --> 17:50.920
hundreds of people will die.

17:52.222 --> 17:54.723
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

18:00.163 --> 18:02.565
Rye whiskey,

18:02.566 --> 18:06.502
large kosher pickles, extra brine, and...

18:06.503 --> 18:08.904
cocktail onions.

18:08.905 --> 18:12.107
You know, you are the only man
who has ever learned my recipe

18:12.108 --> 18:13.789
- for the perfect Pickleback chaser.
- They are

18:13.790 --> 18:15.711
- a crime against good whiskey.
- For a guy who hates 'em,

18:15.712 --> 18:17.676
you sure knock 'em back okay.

18:17.677 --> 18:20.176
Well, maybe I enjoy the company.

18:20.177 --> 18:21.050
Ooh!

18:21.051 --> 18:23.371
You keep bringing me chocolate,
you can keep coming around.

18:24.321 --> 18:26.689
So, did you dig up anything on the Shard?

18:26.690 --> 18:29.225
Well, we've got some bills of lading,

18:29.226 --> 18:34.930
IP addresses off the
Deep Web, and... a face.

18:34.931 --> 18:37.766
Meet the man who's after
the Shard of Anubis...

18:37.767 --> 18:39.869
Mr. Atticus Nevins.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.904
I know this guy, Jenny.

18:41.905 --> 18:43.372
He was a friend of my dad's.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.773
What?

18:44.774 --> 18:46.542
Atticus Nevins? Are you sure?

18:46.543 --> 18:48.644
I... I mean, I didn't know his name.

18:48.645 --> 18:50.246
Dad just called him "Bull"

18:50.247 --> 18:53.182
'cause he carried a
.30-cal in their platoon.

18:53.183 --> 18:55.451
That-that, uh, box I brought
over from the cabin...

18:55.452 --> 18:56.986
- there's an album in it.
- Okay.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.425
Here.

19:05.495 --> 19:07.897
Here. Look.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.733
Uh, your dad sent me on

19:10.734 --> 19:13.636
how many missions buying and
selling strange artifacts?

19:13.637 --> 19:16.405
Yeah, and his old war buddy
happens to be the kingpin

19:16.406 --> 19:18.540
of that entire black market?

19:18.541 --> 19:21.810
What does that say about my dad?

19:21.811 --> 19:24.513
If your dad was using me
as a shill to make money,

19:24.514 --> 19:27.549
- I would know it.
- Are you sure?

19:27.550 --> 19:29.985
I mean, how many secrets
did he keep from me?

19:29.986 --> 19:31.420
Well, we have a name now.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.156
We can use it to get answers.

19:34.157 --> 19:36.658
Joe...

19:37.761 --> 19:40.896
Your dad was...

19:40.897 --> 19:44.633
one of the best guys I've ever known.

19:44.634 --> 19:47.336
And until we have proof otherwise,

19:47.337 --> 19:49.238
I'm holding onto that.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.643
Yeah.

20:02.352 --> 20:04.678
Sorry that took so long. I
had to go do some digging.

20:04.679 --> 20:05.454
Mm.

20:05.455 --> 20:09.692
I see you're doing some
digging of your own.

20:09.693 --> 20:11.193
Or should I say lurking?

20:11.194 --> 20:12.861
Hmm? Oh, hardly.

20:12.862 --> 20:16.165
Miss Corinth suggested I
peruse her "instant gram."

20:16.166 --> 20:18.233
Apparently, I've been "tagged."

20:18.234 --> 20:19.868
Like I said, pure lurk.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.804
The lab here cannot trace the location

20:21.805 --> 20:24.373
of Howe's "primal tomb."
We don't have the equipment.

20:24.374 --> 20:26.442
I could send it to DC,

20:26.443 --> 20:28.711
but that'd be a two-week turnaround.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.379
Perhaps our new friends

20:30.380 --> 20:32.481
at the Jeffersonian Institute
could be of assistance.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.317
Dr. Brennan claimed to be
the premiere forensic analyst

20:35.318 --> 20:36.885
in the country.

20:36.886 --> 20:39.121
Now might be an opportunity
for her and Agent Booth

20:39.122 --> 20:40.990
to "throw down."

20:40.991 --> 20:42.391
And with their help, we might be able

20:42.392 --> 20:44.793
to find the tomb by nightfall.

20:44.794 --> 20:46.795
You navigate. I'll drive.

20:53.970 --> 20:56.005
Greetings on this All Hallows' Eve.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.474
Apologies for showing
up unannounced like this.

20:58.475 --> 21:00.442
- Yeah.
- I trust this will be a short visit.

21:00.443 --> 21:02.444
We have a five-year-old at home

21:02.445 --> 21:05.014
who still has alterations needed
for her Jane Goodall costume.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.249
Yes, I seem to recall
you have two children.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.717
Her brother's going as a chimp.

21:08.718 --> 21:11.086
But that is if we get back in time.

21:11.087 --> 21:14.923
Hey, you said we could give you
a call if we needed your help?

21:14.924 --> 21:17.860
Didn't think it would be
that soon. What's that?

21:27.701 --> 21:30.503
Your lab only analyzed
the cortical surface,

21:30.504 --> 21:33.940
but, over centuries,
components of the coffin

21:33.941 --> 21:36.642
can be absorbed into the cancellous bone.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.879
Which we could use to identify
Howe's initial burial site.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.550
I applaud your scientific instincts,

21:44.551 --> 21:46.352
but your theory

21:46.353 --> 21:49.222
that the Founding Fathers
buried Howe twice is...

21:49.223 --> 21:51.557
questionable, at best.

21:51.558 --> 21:55.394
The Founders held all
manner of superstition.

21:55.395 --> 21:57.096
In fact, your institution's namesake,

21:57.097 --> 21:59.165
Thomas Jefferson, once reported contact

21:59.166 --> 22:00.566
with an alien species.

22:00.567 --> 22:03.236
Well, Jefferson was brilliant.

22:03.237 --> 22:05.238
He also had the scientific knowledge

22:05.239 --> 22:07.707
of a contemporary fourth grader.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.243
You do not believe

22:10.244 --> 22:12.712
in the grander mysteries of the universe.

22:12.713 --> 22:15.915
But what of faith, art,

22:15.916 --> 22:17.383
love?

22:17.384 --> 22:18.785
Are these merely numbers?

22:18.786 --> 22:21.587
Faith results from our fear of death.

22:21.588 --> 22:24.590
Art from our ability to
discern an attractive mate.

22:24.591 --> 22:25.858
And love from our need

22:25.859 --> 22:27.093
to procreate.

22:27.094 --> 22:28.795
Dr. Brennan,

22:28.796 --> 22:31.030
the way you look at Agent Booth

22:31.031 --> 22:34.167
is far more than just procreation.

22:34.168 --> 22:37.503
Actually, procreation
plays a significant part

22:37.504 --> 22:38.905
in our relationship.

22:43.577 --> 22:46.012
Oh, that's interesting.

22:46.013 --> 22:48.147
This bone contains particulates

22:48.148 --> 22:51.050
of quartz and feldspar.

22:51.051 --> 22:52.852
Components of sandstone.

22:52.853 --> 22:57.089
The composition matches
samples from two quarries,

22:57.090 --> 23:00.092
one in Seneca, Maryland,
and one in Montgomery.

23:00.093 --> 23:03.362
Only one structure shares
stone from both those quarries.

23:03.363 --> 23:05.231
The Capitol building.

23:05.232 --> 23:07.834
Washington wished his tomb to be built

23:07.835 --> 23:10.436
within the very foundations
of the building itself.

23:10.437 --> 23:13.639
- A tomb that was never used.
- So your work suggests

23:13.640 --> 23:15.308
the Founders used Washington's empty tomb

23:15.309 --> 23:17.910
to conceal Howe's actual grave site.

23:17.911 --> 23:21.047
Dr. Brennan, Agent Mills
and I deeply appreciate

23:21.048 --> 23:21.930
your assistance.

23:21.931 --> 23:24.517
You just posited the
existence of what may be

23:24.518 --> 23:26.686
an astounding archaeological find.

23:26.687 --> 23:30.723
I demand to participate in your research.

23:33.493 --> 23:38.731
I was just about to propose the very same.

23:40.901 --> 23:42.902
Right. Okay.

23:42.903 --> 23:45.638
You got to help me out
here. You called in a favor

23:45.639 --> 23:47.306
to solve some, what is it,

23:47.307 --> 23:50.476
- two-bit historical mystery?
- History's important.

23:50.477 --> 23:52.303
Somebody's got to keep the record straight.

23:52.304 --> 23:54.380
Okay. So what do you
say we keep it straight?

23:54.381 --> 23:56.048
What is this really all about?

23:56.049 --> 23:58.517
You trying to solve some off-book, uh,

23:58.518 --> 24:02.321
- investigation or something?
- What if it were?

24:02.322 --> 24:04.323
You're one of Corbin's protégés.

24:04.324 --> 24:06.826
I'd still have your back.

24:09.630 --> 24:12.064
First day on the beat, Corbin told me

24:12.065 --> 24:15.635
that most of the real work
you do is outside the job.

24:15.636 --> 24:18.938
That worked for local PD, but the Bureau...

24:18.939 --> 24:20.706
That's-that's a whole new level.

24:20.707 --> 24:22.341
I've dreamt about this
for years. I don't want

24:22.342 --> 24:23.943
- to mess up my shot.
- So why don't you trust

24:23.944 --> 24:26.279
August Corbin? He knew what you had.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.381
You have to believe that.

24:30.517 --> 24:32.184
We have a lead on Howe's tomb.

24:32.185 --> 24:34.720
- Are we all ready to go?
- All of us?

24:34.721 --> 24:38.024
Negotiation's not really
in Dr. Brennan's nature.

24:38.025 --> 24:40.693
- She doesn't like to negotiate.
- This could be a history-making discovery.

24:40.694 --> 24:42.695
Or it could prove Mr. Crane dead wrong.

24:42.696 --> 24:44.664
I am comfortable with either outcome.

24:44.665 --> 24:47.033
You're always comfortable.
Okay, what do you say we do this.

24:47.034 --> 24:48.968
Crane, nice coat. Come
on. Which way we going?

24:48.969 --> 24:49.935
Come on. Let's go.

24:57.577 --> 24:59.578
I don't know.

24:59.579 --> 25:02.915
I may have been wrong about this address.

25:02.916 --> 25:04.750
It was listed on half
the documents on Nevins,

25:04.751 --> 25:07.420
- so I just thought...
- No, this is the place.

25:07.421 --> 25:10.423
I've been here before.

25:10.424 --> 25:13.192
I was just a kid.

25:13.193 --> 25:14.694
I told you my dad

25:14.695 --> 25:18.698
and Nevins would go up
to the cabin sometimes.

25:18.699 --> 25:22.802
We'd stop here to get supplies.

25:22.803 --> 25:24.570
Dad would buy me a
sandwich, sit me out front

25:24.571 --> 25:25.671
while he went inside.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.041
Hey. That doesn't necessarily mean...

25:29.042 --> 25:31.010
That he was working with Nevins?

25:31.011 --> 25:34.613
You said it yourself... the
man had a lot of secrets.

25:37.918 --> 25:38.884
There she is.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.986
Follow my lead.

25:51.031 --> 25:52.498
Whoa.

25:52.499 --> 25:54.767
- The balls on you two.
- Hey, easy.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.802
All we want is to sit down with your boss.

25:56.803 --> 25:59.939
Yeah? That's not gonna happen.

25:59.940 --> 26:02.441
It's a personal thing. A family thing.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.043
- Am I supposed to care?
- All right,

26:04.044 --> 26:05.311
we'll give you the Shard.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.614
That's what he wants, right?

26:08.615 --> 26:10.783
- Hey, hey, Joe, hold on.
- Nevins sits down with us,

26:10.784 --> 26:13.552
answers my questions,
and we'll give it to him.

26:13.553 --> 26:15.688
You have my word.

26:17.424 --> 26:18.858
All right.

26:18.859 --> 26:21.160
He's down in the city on business, but, uh,

26:21.161 --> 26:23.996
I'll see what I can arrange.

26:23.997 --> 26:26.999
Oh. Funny thing,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.068
after you stole the Shard
from me that first time,

26:29.069 --> 26:31.037
I told Nevins I'd find you, get it back.

26:31.038 --> 26:33.205
He told me to sit tight,

26:33.206 --> 26:35.041
that you'd show up on your own soon enough.

26:46.219 --> 26:48.954
Are you crazy?

26:48.955 --> 26:50.656
We still don't know what
the hell that thing is.

26:50.657 --> 26:52.691
I know. And I'm sorry. It's just...

26:52.692 --> 26:55.628
Look, we may not get a
chance like this again.

26:55.629 --> 26:57.997
Look, I promise, I won't
let anything bad happen.

26:57.998 --> 27:02.168
Joe, in this world, that is
not a promise you can make.

27:15.682 --> 27:17.716
Sorry we couldn't take the tour.

27:17.717 --> 27:20.052
It was everything the
Founding Fathers dreamt of.

27:20.053 --> 27:22.855
Great. A musty old basement, huh?

27:22.856 --> 27:26.926
A basement is never just
a basement with the Masons.

27:26.927 --> 27:28.661
Oh...

27:30.230 --> 27:32.298
Hold on. Okay...

27:32.299 --> 27:34.233
that symbol there has no notch,

27:34.234 --> 27:35.768
but this symbol has a notch.

27:35.769 --> 27:38.637
Its placement calls to mind a keyhole.

27:38.638 --> 27:42.842
It's not just rounded.
It's a few centimeters deep.

27:42.843 --> 27:44.944
Crane, your ring.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
- Doctor...
- Oh.

27:48.081 --> 27:49.248
Thank you.

27:49.249 --> 27:51.117
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

27:51.118 --> 27:52.118
Thank you.

27:57.824 --> 27:59.492
Oh! Oh.

28:04.297 --> 28:06.699
- This is astonishing.
- Mm.

28:06.700 --> 28:10.236
And yet, only this morning,
it was questionable.

28:12.239 --> 28:13.973
Somewhere in here should
be the secret to defeating

28:13.974 --> 28:16.208
- Howe's Draugur Army.
- Well, it'll be hard to find

28:16.209 --> 28:18.911
with those two looking over our shoulders.

28:18.912 --> 28:20.913
Oh...

28:20.914 --> 28:23.015
Whoa. Did you see this, Mr. Crane?

28:23.016 --> 28:25.251
These runes match the markings

28:25.252 --> 28:28.420
- on the original coffin.
- All right, look, Abbie,

28:28.421 --> 28:30.856
this isn't off the book...
this is off the reservation.

28:34.227 --> 28:35.394
- Whoa, whoa...
- Crane!

28:35.395 --> 28:37.463
Booth!

28:42.554 --> 28:44.288
Crane!

28:45.484 --> 28:48.623
Crane, can you hear me? Crane.

28:49.928 --> 28:50.729
There must be

28:50.730 --> 28:52.998
a gear counterweight operating the wall.

28:55.002 --> 28:56.403
Whoa.

28:58.005 --> 29:01.908
Oh, my. I have a bad feeling about this.

29:06.047 --> 29:08.215
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

29:08.216 --> 29:10.818
A fuse just sparked. We
got to get 'em out of there.

29:11.819 --> 29:12.952
Doctor, stay down.

29:18.426 --> 29:19.426
Crane!

29:23.531 --> 29:25.365
This is no ordinary blaze.

29:25.366 --> 29:27.334
I believe this is Greek fire,

29:27.335 --> 29:29.803
a legendary flame that
cannot be extinguished.

29:30.938 --> 29:32.505
The odor indicates

29:32.506 --> 29:34.007
a combination of naphthenic

29:34.008 --> 29:35.709
and palmitic acids.

29:35.710 --> 29:37.877
This is napalm.

29:37.878 --> 29:40.280
Crane!

29:40.281 --> 29:42.515
Crane! We got to get them out of there.

29:42.516 --> 29:44.084
Hold on. What is this?

29:44.085 --> 29:45.852
Uh, yeah, okay. I've seen a lock

29:45.853 --> 29:48.855
like this before. Each button
represents an alchemical symbol.

29:48.856 --> 29:51.624
It's like a puzzle. All we
have to do is figure out...

29:53.327 --> 29:55.995
- Your way works, too.
- Right.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.067
Bones.

30:01.068 --> 30:03.303
You insisted on coming.

30:03.304 --> 30:05.405
Right. Okay.

30:05.406 --> 30:07.874
- All right. You okay?
- This is extraordinary.

30:07.875 --> 30:11.311
A hidden tomb armed with
a precursor to napalm.

30:11.312 --> 30:13.079
- Do you understand what this means?
- I don't know.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.349
- George Washington is a complete badass?
- No, no. It means

30:16.350 --> 30:18.985
- we need to excavate this
entire subterranean - Oh.

30:18.986 --> 30:22.254
installation. It should be mapped, exhumed.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.023
- We shouldn't even be here.
- All right, slow down. Okay,

30:24.024 --> 30:25.792
- we got to go. We'll get everything back
- We are contaminating the site.

30:25.793 --> 30:28.293
to the Jeffersonian, okay? Let's
go, Crane. Get out of there.

30:31.499 --> 30:33.166
You're not worried about them?

30:33.167 --> 30:36.603
Hardly. Her skepticism's interminable.

30:36.604 --> 30:39.506
She'd dismiss Moloch as a
tall man with a skin condition.

30:39.507 --> 30:43.476
Though we do have cause for worry.

30:43.477 --> 30:47.280
I believe I have discovered
the Draugur's weakness.

30:47.281 --> 30:50.550
And that's bad because...?

30:50.551 --> 30:54.854
We'll have to burn Sleepy
Hollow to the ground.

30:59.627 --> 31:01.995
There can be only one reason
why Washington would deploy

31:01.996 --> 31:04.130
such volatile ordnance
right under the Capitol.

31:05.232 --> 31:07.734
It was a trap...

31:07.735 --> 31:10.670
- built for a very specific threat.
- The Draugur.

31:10.671 --> 31:13.139
And since Howe was their commander,

31:13.140 --> 31:15.141
anyone that survived would try to rescue

31:15.142 --> 31:16.843
- their master's body.
- And, in doing so,

31:16.844 --> 31:19.145
would be faced with their only weakness,

31:19.146 --> 31:21.214
Greek fire.

31:21.215 --> 31:22.816
Yeah, Brennan said it was
just some kind of napalm.

31:22.817 --> 31:24.037
We'll get our hands on some.

31:26.287 --> 31:28.988
- Why would that pose a threat to the town?
- Because Greek fire

31:28.989 --> 31:31.758
is far more sinister than your napalm.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.794
It cannot be extinguished
by water or by sand.

31:34.795 --> 31:38.097
Once unleashed, it burns
until nothing remains.

31:39.900 --> 31:44.237
As I believe was remonstrated
on the isle of Manhattan.

31:44.238 --> 31:47.173
Betsy Ross was leading Patriot refugees

31:47.174 --> 31:50.977
off the island via a
series of hidden tunnels.

31:50.978 --> 31:52.145
Crane.

31:52.146 --> 31:53.580
Betsy.

31:53.581 --> 31:56.249
I come from Howe's encampment.

31:57.485 --> 32:00.253
He lives. And he refuses
to relinquish the city.

32:00.254 --> 32:01.654
Our orders have changed.

32:01.655 --> 32:03.490
I'm to get out of the city

32:03.491 --> 32:04.858
before countermeasures are deployed.

32:04.859 --> 32:07.093
- What countermeasures?
- Ichabod, please.

32:07.094 --> 32:08.494
There's no time.

32:12.867 --> 32:15.101
You're saying if the
countermeasure was Greek fire...

32:15.102 --> 32:16.736
Yes, Lieutenant.

32:16.737 --> 32:19.939
Then we were not facing
conventional forces...

32:21.108 --> 32:23.943
...but a cadre of Draugur.

32:26.146 --> 32:29.115
Merely hours after the British invaded,

32:29.116 --> 32:32.819
the city was set ablaze in
the Great Fire of New York,

32:32.820 --> 32:36.256
the cause of which remained a mystery...

32:36.257 --> 32:38.091
until now.

32:50.538 --> 32:51.638
Hyah!

32:57.845 --> 33:00.847
Washington had no choice...
he was facing a zombie army.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.448
Howe desecrated

33:02.449 --> 33:04.884
the dead to build an unstoppable army,

33:04.885 --> 33:06.719
one which required an indomitable weapon

33:06.720 --> 33:08.488
in order to stop it.

33:08.489 --> 33:10.823
And now we are faced
with a similar dilemma.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.625
That's not an option.

33:12.626 --> 33:14.027
Fine.

33:14.028 --> 33:16.529
Then we find another way.

33:20.935 --> 33:22.769
Trick or treat!

33:25.873 --> 33:28.408
What do you say?

33:28.409 --> 33:29.976
Boo!

33:31.312 --> 33:34.113
April, slow down!

33:34.114 --> 33:36.282
April!

33:36.283 --> 33:38.318
April?!

33:38.319 --> 33:40.820
April, where are you, sweetie?

33:42.256 --> 33:44.891
April!

33:44.892 --> 33:48.227
And where is your mother, dear?

33:49.530 --> 33:51.764
It would break her heart if she lost you.

33:51.765 --> 33:54.867
And you don't want to lose your treats.

33:56.370 --> 33:59.405
We never had sweets when I was a girl.

34:19.092 --> 34:20.793
General...

34:23.964 --> 34:26.666
Are your men prepared to assemble?

34:28.369 --> 34:30.837
When the last sunbeam sets...

34:33.007 --> 34:36.074
...go forth and slaughter.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.020
Sun sets in 15 minutes

34:45.021 --> 34:47.109
at which point the whole town
will be out on the street.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.101
- So, what did you call these things?
- Cheirosiphones.

34:49.101 --> 34:50.603
A post-Hellenic weapon

34:50.603 --> 34:53.138
designed specifically to deploy Greek fire.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.940
We've mixed ten gallons of
the stuff, but once it lights,

34:54.940 --> 34:56.108
how do we put out the blaze?

34:56.109 --> 34:57.509
We draw them into the tunnels.

34:57.510 --> 34:58.944
If we can contain the Draugur underground,

34:58.945 --> 35:01.347
- we do not risk burning the town.
- Wait,

35:01.348 --> 35:03.133
I missed how we get them
down there in the first place.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.750
I shall be bait.

35:04.751 --> 35:06.185
The general loathes me

35:06.186 --> 35:09.555
with a sempiternal fervor,
and where he goes...

35:09.556 --> 35:12.157
the Draugur follow.

35:38.518 --> 35:40.953
Hey, Mom! Look! Soldiers!

35:40.954 --> 35:43.355
Check it out.

35:43.356 --> 35:45.424
Cool costumes!

35:47.761 --> 35:50.062
Company... halt!

35:51.531 --> 35:54.266
Whoa! Take a look at that!

35:58.571 --> 36:00.339
- Sweet!
- Ready, men!

36:03.743 --> 36:04.910
Aim!

36:09.015 --> 36:09.848
Fire!

36:17.524 --> 36:18.824
Over here!

36:22.228 --> 36:25.097
Everybody, move! That way! Come on! Move!

36:29.602 --> 36:31.136
General Howe.

36:31.137 --> 36:32.538
I'm the one you want.

36:37.410 --> 36:39.845
Let's end this.

36:45.585 --> 36:48.020
Is that the best you've got, General?

37:24.557 --> 37:28.293
I hope you know what you're doing, Crane.

37:38.471 --> 37:40.773
Now!

37:40.774 --> 37:43.609
Let 'em burn!

38:07.600 --> 38:10.869
Oh... Timely assist. Thank you.

38:10.870 --> 38:12.170
Compliments later. Let's move.

38:19.312 --> 38:20.712
Crane!

38:22.615 --> 38:24.149
Your army's defeated, Howe!

38:26.619 --> 38:28.420
It's over.

38:29.489 --> 38:32.424
I should have ended this long ago.

38:34.661 --> 38:37.963
I will not give you the satisfaction...

38:37.964 --> 38:39.698
turncoat.

39:08.268 --> 39:11.737
A valiant battle, General.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.908
Now...

39:19.513 --> 39:22.381
...one more bud to blossom...

39:24.251 --> 39:27.219
...one more here to sting.

39:28.589 --> 39:30.223
Love...

39:30.224 --> 39:32.191
is what the victors bring.

39:37.598 --> 39:39.465
We're glad to hear the
Jeffersonian's decided

39:39.466 --> 39:41.659
to take Washington's tomb
under its jurisdiction.

39:41.660 --> 39:44.294
Oh, I'd start by getting
rid of the napalm first.

39:44.295 --> 39:45.863
The Jeffersonian would love your help

39:45.864 --> 39:47.231
with the excavation, Mr. Crane.

39:47.232 --> 39:49.033
Ooh. Well, I'm flattered,

39:49.034 --> 39:51.301
but I am in the process of renovating

39:51.302 --> 39:52.870
a historical property of my own.

39:52.871 --> 39:54.571
Too bad. The site poses

39:54.572 --> 39:57.873
more than a few questions.
If colonial Americans

39:57.874 --> 39:59.451
had Greek fire,

39:59.452 --> 40:02.052
why didn't they use it during
the battles of the Revolution?

40:02.053 --> 40:03.947
And you still haven't
sufficiently explained

40:03.948 --> 40:05.414
how you came across Washington's letter.

40:05.415 --> 40:07.782
Let it go, Bones, just... let it go.

40:07.783 --> 40:08.908
Thanks again for your help.

40:08.909 --> 40:10.299
Yeah. You know what, don't mention it.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.543
But next time you find a death trap,

40:11.544 --> 40:12.878
just give us a heads-up first.

40:12.879 --> 40:15.881
Oh, yes, we shall. You have our word.

40:23.322 --> 40:25.524
You okay, Crane?

40:25.525 --> 40:27.426
I know seeing Howe must
have been difficult.

40:27.427 --> 40:29.761
Oh, I feel relieved.

40:30.963 --> 40:32.297
He's a part of my past

40:32.298 --> 40:34.149
- I can put behind me.
- Even the ghosts

40:34.150 --> 40:36.635
of the past have to take a break.

40:39.372 --> 40:41.873
But... sometimes they need

40:41.874 --> 40:43.008
a little push.

40:43.009 --> 40:44.576
I don't follow.

40:44.577 --> 40:46.678
Zoe. Call her.

40:47.580 --> 40:49.147
She's a good one.

41:10.002 --> 41:13.071
Miss Corinth, it is Ichabod Crane.

41:13.072 --> 41:14.873
Ichabod.

41:15.775 --> 41:17.142
Yes. Of course.

41:17.143 --> 41:19.344
Uh, caller identification is a marvel.

41:20.747 --> 41:22.147
No. No, no.

41:22.148 --> 41:26.051
I... I was merely wondering...

41:26.052 --> 41:30.689
if you have no prior
engagement this evening...

41:30.690 --> 41:34.926
I would be honored to escort you to supper.

41:35.928 --> 41:38.063
You wanted to see me?

41:38.064 --> 41:39.664
Yeah. Take a seat.

41:39.665 --> 41:42.067
Can you shut the door for me, please?

41:42.068 --> 41:44.469
Mm-hmm.

41:44.470 --> 41:48.173
Uh... I just wanted to say
how much I appreciate you

41:48.174 --> 41:50.008
offering me a spot on the team.

41:50.009 --> 41:52.811
I know it's been a hectic few
weeks, but I can handle it.

41:52.812 --> 41:54.946
Burn the candle at both ends if I have to.

41:54.947 --> 41:55.947
I want in.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.616
Yeah? Well, it may be

41:57.617 --> 41:59.451
a little more complicated
than that, because it

41:59.452 --> 42:01.153
looks like you already are a part of it.

42:01.154 --> 42:03.021
The man I'm working to take down,

42:03.022 --> 42:04.589
his name is Atticus Nevins.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.424
And the woman in the photo,

42:06.425 --> 42:09.194
the one your sister and her
EMT friend are meeting with,

42:09.195 --> 42:12.030
she's his top operative.

42:12.031 --> 42:14.900
So I ask, what the hell is going on here?
