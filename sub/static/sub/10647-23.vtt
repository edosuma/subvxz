Hey, settle down back there.

00:07.358 --> 00:09.058
Don't make me turn
this Spider Jet around.

00:09.093 --> 00:12.303
I've been on the team the longest.
Next time, I get shotgun.

00:12.438 --> 00:14.660
Then next time, remember to call it.

00:14.866 --> 00:17.240
Wouldn't be a road trip
without some backseat bickering,

00:17.319 --> 00:20.194

up some unexpected guests.

of them now, I hope.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.523
I know how to get rid
of some dead weight.

00:48.558 --> 00:50.716
No need to get all testy.

00:50.752 --> 00:52.251
We just don't like being crammed in.

00:52.286 --> 00:55.322
Apologies. I will make room.

00:55.624 --> 00:58.451
Ugh. Creepy.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.820
- I'm not sure if this is better.
- No need to squabble anymore.

01:01.850 --> 01:03.106
We're coming in for a landing.

01:07.961 --> 01:09.471
Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:09.495 --> 01:11.964
All my ideas are good. Which
one are you talking about?

01:12.073 --> 01:13.814
Bringing me back to the Triskelion.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.375
Last time I was here, I betrayed the
entire team to the Sinister Six,

01:17.376 --> 01:18.978
and I think I may have left the milk out.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.003
That was you?

01:20.004 --> 01:23.395
But then you made up for it by turning
on Doc Ock and saving all of Manhattan.

01:23.396 --> 01:26.964
Don't worry. I'm sure S.H.I.E.L.D.
academy will welcome you with open arms.

Maybe Scarlet tricked us

Bottom line, those Spider Slayer

I hate to say it,

DR. CURT: This device pulls in

The output capacity of the
Spider Slayers is astounding.

03:30.228 --> 03:33.618
Thanks. No one's ever
said that to me before.

03:33.698 --> 03:36.147

03:43.324 --> 03:45.866
SPIDER-MAN: So, how come
there are four pods?

03:45.902 --> 03:48.811
Well, since Scarlet spider
is part synthezoid,

03:48.846 --> 03:51.508

03:52.476 --> 03:54.347

Or perhaps that we should simply
err on the side of caution.

Oh, come on. You, too, Cho?

03:58.748 --> 04:02.140

Scarlet couldn't have done this, Flash.

He was asleep in the bunks,
just like you and me.

05:01.252 --> 05:05.318
So everyone who dissed you before just
happens to get taken down?

05:05.408 --> 05:06.875
Not everyone.

The Slayers are still in their
pods, which lock from the outside.

05:18.011 --> 05:20.196
Which means someone else
took down our friends.

05:20.429 --> 05:23.447
And because of the lockdown, they
must still be in the building.

05:26.953 --> 05:30.070
They're not just unconscious,
they're in some kind of coma.

05:30.406 --> 05:31.692

Pretty clever, covering your
tracks for the bushy-tails.

06:29.498 --> 06:30.806
Will you give it a rest, Flash?

06:30.842 --> 06:32.867
Nobody else believes Scarlet did this.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.852
- Well...
- Seriously, MJ?

06:37.073 --> 06:39.783
All I'm saying is, he's still
the most likely suspect.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.957
So why take chances?

06:42.116 --> 06:44.695
I say we lock him up with
the rest of his family.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.786
None of you are gonna put me in stasis,

have to do this, Ben.

06:54.095 --> 06:58.002

07:18.690 --> 07:20.856
No. But I'm not sure
he's innocent either.

07:20.891 --> 07:24.506

We've been over this, Flash.

08:06.407 --> 08:09.332
Scarlet couldn't have done this.
He's locked in his stasis pod.

08:22.926 --> 08:25.511
The pods can only be
opened from the outside.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.698

- (IN UNISON) Scarlet?

11:12.114 --> 11:13.597
Kaine's gotten a lot tougher.

11:13.691 --> 11:15.707
Last time, my stinger sliced him in half.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.079
So what are you gonna do with that thing?

11:18.103 --> 11:19.552
Measure his energy output?

11:19.588 --> 11:21.804
Opposite. Gonna transmit energy.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.806
Amplify it.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.490
(BEEPS)

11:23.525 --> 11:24.566
Trust me.

11:26.295 --> 11:27.536
(GROWLING)

couldn't trust Scarlet.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.795
(GRUNTS)

11:37.764 --> 11:39.810
Hey! I was trying
to overload him.

11:39.817 --> 11:41.421
More like feed him.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.417
Guys, less fighting, and more...

11:44.088 --> 11:45.013
Fighting.

11:45.730 --> 11:46.864
(GRUNTING)

11:46.866 --> 11:49.399
Hey, it's not my fault
Scarlet unleashed this...

11:50.135 --> 11:51.473
I don't even know what it is.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.380
(YELLS)

11:55.415 --> 11:56.971
SCARLET SPIDER: You got
it backwards, Venom.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.309
Kaine unleashed me!

11:59.445 --> 12:03.008
He tried to feed on me,
but I managed to escape him.

(KAINE GROANS)

12:18.873 --> 12:20.276
Just follow my lead, okay?

12:20.277 --> 12:21.526
Yo, Kaine!

12:21.526 --> 12:24.222
Come and feast on some
nutritious spider energy.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.331
I swear I have a plan. I just
need to bring in some backup.

12:30.592 --> 12:33.352
(ROARING)

12:33.429 --> 12:35.676
AGENT VENOM: What backup?
Everyone's out cold.

12:37.607 --> 12:39.769
- SPIDER-MAN: Not everyone.
- Yeah.

12:39.785 --> 12:43.151
More crazy, uncontrollable synthezoids.
Great idea.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.650
You know what to do, Ben.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.375
(SCOFFS)
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:48.410 --> 12:51.245
(KAINE YELLS) (ALL GRUNT)

12:51.280 --> 12:54.542
Spiders need to feed.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.366
Slayers, attack!

12:57.728 --> 12:59.722
As you command!

13:02.649 --> 13:04.650
Slayers, halt!

13:06.987 --> 13:09.497
I said attack!

13:09.498 --> 13:13.016
Kaine, Slayers same.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.586
Made in lab by humans.

13:16.622 --> 13:18.689
Humans throw away Kaine,

13:18.724 --> 13:20.423
throw away Slayers.

13:20.459 --> 13:23.977
Kaine, Slayers not trust humans.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.572
Kaine, Slayers fight humans!

13:27.608 --> 13:31.259
Gotta say, Kaine's making some sense.

13:31.295 --> 13:34.728
Did he save you from
Hydra Island? No. I did.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.784
KAINE: Saved to make
slave for humans.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.477
Scarlet is close to the humans.

13:41.478 --> 13:44.364
(SNIFFING)

13:44.400 --> 13:47.993
Has scent of human. Half human.

Time to join the winning team.

(ALL GRUNT)

14:12.086 --> 14:14.247
Betrayed by the teammates
you trust, Scarlet?

14:14.477 --> 14:16.350
Payback's a real bummer.

14:20.936 --> 14:22.940
Blame later. Defend now!

14:25.023 --> 14:27.848
Ben, buddy, anything you can
do to get control back?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.948
Toss them some spider
treats or something?

Small spider will be crushed!

Try. I'll shred you to pieces.

15:04.838 --> 15:07.021
Oh, man! That's cheating.

Cheating does not violate

Thank Doc Connors.

15:50.462 --> 15:54.376
Apparently, us human spiders recharge
a lot quicker than these synthezoids.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.005
(GROWLS)

15:57.040 --> 15:59.470
And my armor protected me
from most of Kaine's shock.

The web warriors are back together,
and that's good enough for me.

Now, first order of business,
divide and conquer.

pointed against him.

I didn't do anything.
It was all Scarlet.
