<i>All around me are familiar faces</i>

00:16.305 --> 00:22.419
<i>Worn out places, worn out faces</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:27.040
<i>Bright and early for their daily races</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:33.628
<i>Going nowhere, going nowhere</i>

00:33.628 --> 00:38.329
<i>And their tears are filling up their glasses</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:44.598
<i>No expression, no expression</i>

00:44.598 --> 00:49.321
<i>Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow</i>

00:49.321 --> 00:55.518
<i>No tommorow, no tommorow</i>

00:55.718 --> 00:58.914
<i>And I find it kind of funny</i>

00:58.914 --> 01:01.295
<i>I find it kind of sad</i>

01:01.730 --> 01:04.220
<i>The dreams in which I'm dying</i>

01:04.220 --> 01:06.873
<i>Are the best I've ever had</i>

01:06.873 --> 01:09.757
<i>I find it hard to tell you</i>

01:09.759 --> 01:12.368
<i>'Cos I find it hard to take</i>

01:12.368 --> 01:15.415
<i>When people run in circles</i>

01:15.415 --> 01:17.355
<i>It's a very, very</i>

<i>Mad world</i>

01:23.554 --> 01:26.554

01:27.580 --> 01:30.179
- Hey ! Where's my money ?
- You wait here !

01:30.179 --> 01:33.429
<i>Children waiting for the day they feel good</i>

01:33.429 --> 01:39.100
<i>Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday</i>

01:39.101 --> 01:40.418
You want to come with us ?

01:44.288 --> 01:49.288
<i>Sit and listen, sit and listen</i>

01:49.290 --> 01:51.893
- My God.
- Come on.

01:51.894 --> 01:55.718
<i>Went to school and I was very nervous</i>

Gunshot wound to the neck.
No visible GSR*.
(*Galvanic Skin Response)

02:38.100 --> 02:40.877
Money on the visor.
It wasn't a robbery.

02:40.877 --> 02:44.892
Dirt clods on the floor mat look undisturbed.

02:44.892 --> 02:46.766
Could be from the last fare.

02:46.991 --> 02:49.357
I don't see any shell casings, though.

02:49.917 --> 02:53.231
Partition's closed.
Bullet-proof glass.

02:53.231 --> 02:55.570
He was not shot from inside.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.229
Well, I got two bullet holes
in the passenger door.

03:11.229 --> 03:13.513
That's a weird side of the car for a drive-by.

03:13.513 --> 03:16.206
Maybe he wasn't shot here.
Maybe he just ended up here.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.455
Excuse me.

03:22.455 --> 03:24.650
- Are you with the Transit Board ?
- Yeah.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.566
Do you have the dispatch log ?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.212
Thanks.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.813
Why's he leaving ?

03:45.813 --> 03:48.906
Well, that's kind of what he does.

03:50.935 --> 03:53.774
- Is this camera always on ?
- Only on HBO.

03:53.774 --> 03:56.102
It takes stills for ten seconds
when the door opens,

03:56.102 --> 03:57.785
and then for the first ten seconds of the fare.

03:57.785 --> 03:59.689
We're gonna need the pictures.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.968
- This is Catherine.
- It's Gil.

04:06.968 --> 04:09.903
- How you doing ?
- I'm busy.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.778
- Checking up on me ?
- Why would I need to do that ?

04:12.778 --> 04:14.120
You tell me.

04:14.325 --> 04:18.369
Look, I know you tend to get a little
territorial about your crime scenes,

04:18.369 --> 04:21.053
and I don't want there
to be any tension between us,

04:21.053 --> 04:23.172
so I'm giving you fair warning.

04:23.172 --> 04:25.168
Fair warning for what ?

04:26.069 --> 04:27.237
Hi !

04:34.898 --> 04:36.548
Julian Harper.

04:36.550 --> 04:40.683
If it weren't for the cyanosis,
I'd say he was doing a photo shoot for GQ.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.667
Yeah, I'm sure
he wasn't ready for this photo shoot.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.731
Body temp's 95.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.982
That would make T.O.D.
approximately 3:00 a.m.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.312
Well, there's plenty of drugs around here.
You think he OD'd ?

05:07.390 --> 05:09.009
Yeah, no edema.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.557
Some petechia.

05:12.557 --> 05:15.232
Could be suffocation or strangulation.

05:15.629 --> 05:19.903
But no ligature marks or bruising.
However...

05:21.400 --> 05:23.352
some fibers under the chin.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.969
- What are you doing ?
- It's for my scrapbook.

05:38.969 --> 05:44.115
I've got a perfect spot for him...
A place of honor between Tupac and Entwhistle.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.740
The taxi's last dropoff was this address.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.249
This guy's got dirt on his shoes and pants.

05:52.249 --> 05:55.285
There was dirt in the cab.
He's got to be the last fare.

05:55.285 --> 05:57.652
So, somebody killed them both.

05:58.508 --> 06:02.862
And if it's about money,
doesn't look like this guy has much.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.765
Well, I guess it's relative.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.137
It depends on who you are.

06:39.645 --> 06:42.365
CSI : épisode 6x02
Room Service

06:45.500 --> 06:48.120
Samay...
Samay Thao.

06:48.120 --> 06:52.679
15527 East Charleston Road.
That's a long way from here.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.439
I count 6 shots in his chest.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.907
There were two in the cab,
one in the cabbie.

07:01.968 --> 07:04.718
If the math is correct,
that's nine.

07:04.718 --> 07:07.754
Suggests semi-automatic,
but I don't see any shell casings here.

07:07.754 --> 07:09.929
Yeah, there were none in the taxi, either.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.936
Killer could have picked them up.

07:13.219 --> 07:15.402
To shoot a guy six times in the torso,

07:15.403 --> 07:17.622
you either have to be very close,
or a hell of a shot.

07:17.622 --> 07:19.756
- It's okay if I roll him ?
- Yeah.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.497
Well, no through and throughs.

07:27.497 --> 07:30.268
We should be able to recover
some bullets from the body.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.114
Hang on.

07:33.664 --> 07:35.048
What do you make of that ?

07:35.403 --> 07:37.926
Looks like he rubbed up
against something.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.225
Could be transfert from that railing.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.721
We got blood drops.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.517
This looks fresh.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.319
Hey, Brass ?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.740
Las Vegas Police !
Put the gun down !

08:51.000 --> 08:53.460
Put the gun down !
Put it down.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.623
I shoot... burglar !

09:07.910 --> 09:09.527
Julian Harper.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.779
Wasn't he supposed to be like...
the next Brad Pitt or something ?

09:12.779 --> 09:15.813
Yeah.
Now he's the next River Phoenix.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.880
- All right, Gerald.
- They call me Blinky.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.157
And what was your relation to Julian Harper ?

09:25.157 --> 09:27.225
Best friends since kindergarten.

09:27.225 --> 09:29.810
- Now I work for him.
- What did you do for him ?

09:29.810 --> 09:31.741
Pretty much everything.
You know,

09:31.741 --> 09:33.436
bought his stuff, hooked him up.

09:33.436 --> 09:35.645
- Drove him to meetings.
- Did you find the body ?

09:35.645 --> 09:37.276
I ordered room service.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.259
I wanted to see if he was hungry.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.378
Boom, there he was.

09:42.378 --> 09:44.476
Did you touch or move the body
in any way ?

09:44.476 --> 09:47.166
No way. No.
I watch those murder shows, you know ?

09:47.166 --> 09:50.470
I know to just keep my hands to myself,
and call the cops.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.438
What is with the robe ?

09:55.038 --> 09:56.279
Did you pat him down ?

09:56.279 --> 09:58.582
He's packing a small, friendly weapon.

09:58.582 --> 10:00.809
Would you mind standing up for us, sir ?

10:00.809 --> 10:05.437
Nah, bro, I... I... I... kind of got the angle of the dangle going.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.913
- The boing, boing, boing.
- Stand up.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.813
I took a Prevalis on the plane over.

10:18.813 --> 10:20.756
I been pitching a tent for, like, eight hours.

10:20.766 --> 10:23.637
Yeah, I... I think I need to consult a physician.

10:23.637 --> 10:26.710
It's called a priapism.
Just in case you were wondering.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.565
- What else are you on, man ?
- Nothing.

10:29.565 --> 10:32.574
I mean, I smoked a little herb
at the club, but that's it.

10:32.574 --> 10:33.790
What about Julian ?

10:33.790 --> 10:37.041
Jules ? No, he...
he won't even take aspirin.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.850
You know, he's organic. You know,
treats his body like a temple.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.308
Well, we're gonna need
a list of everyone

10:41.309 --> 10:43.303
who was here worshipping the temple.

10:43.718 --> 10:46.100
- Can I sit down ?
- Yeah.

10:47.745 --> 10:49.764
Did someone turn a shower on
or something ?

10:49.764 --> 10:51.797
You cleared that room, right ?

11:11.315 --> 11:12.417
Are you okay ?

11:14.250 --> 11:15.917
We need a medic !

11:17.079 --> 11:19.895
And a bag for stomach contents.

11:26.532 --> 11:28.090
His name is Keo Vipraxay.

11:28.090 --> 11:30.870
He barely speaks English.
He's South Asian, I think.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.893
Anyway, it's all clear.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.027
Thanks, Jim.

11:47.030 --> 11:48.447
Double-aught buck.

11:48.796 --> 11:50.950
Standard shot is nine pellets.

11:50.950 --> 11:52.675
That would account for all the hits.

11:55.300 --> 11:59.818
So you're saying that a single shotgun blast,
through a security door,

11:59.818 --> 12:03.755
took out two separate victims
in two separate locations ?

12:03.755 --> 12:04.932
Weird ?

12:04.932 --> 12:08.420
The cab drops Samay Thao
in front of this building.

12:08.951 --> 12:11.771
And the position of the blood drops
give us a pretty good idea

12:11.771 --> 12:14.044
of where Samay was standing when he was shot.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.190
He was a little shorter than me.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.866
Shots were centered
on his chest, about there.

12:22.156 --> 12:25.587
My guess is,
the cab was parked down there,

12:25.588 --> 12:27.520
the driver peeled out when he got shot.

12:34.347 --> 12:38.751
Vertical deflection down
to the cab is roughly 60 degrees.

12:39.707 --> 12:41.746
Standard shot won't spread that far.

12:41.746 --> 12:44.148
The pellets must have come through the screen.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.614
The old billiard ball effect.

12:53.891 --> 12:56.154
The cab driver was collateral damage.

12:57.283 --> 13:00.688
But the man with the shotgun said
he shot a burglar.

13:00.904 --> 13:02.567
What's here to steal ?

13:06.300 --> 13:12.266
Semen on the bed sheets, as well as
every other flat surface in here.

13:12.916 --> 13:13.962
Yeah.

13:14.492 --> 13:18.585
I've got vodka, champagne, cocaine...

13:18.585 --> 13:19.706
Hey, hey.

13:20.021 --> 13:21.312
Pantyhose.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.805
I've got some smudges over here.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.277
I've got some footprints.

13:49.190 --> 13:52.114
Looks like someone
was standing right there.

13:52.572 --> 13:56.019
Was this guy just doing it
all over the hotel room ?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.920
If those are his footprints...

14:00.369 --> 14:01.882
where are hers ?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.419
Or her feet were up...

14:04.818 --> 14:05.869
in the air.

14:05.869 --> 14:08.195
You tell me...
You just had your honeymoon.

14:08.654 --> 14:10.678
You want to swab this ?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.147
I just don't understand.

14:19.147 --> 14:21.142
I mean, who would want to kill Julian ?

14:21.763 --> 14:23.469
I mean, he'd had some weird fan mail,

14:23.469 --> 14:26.630
but I don't think any of those kind of people
would be able to get in his suite.

14:26.630 --> 14:27.977
Were you in his suite ?

14:27.977 --> 14:31.583
The ex-wife isn't exactly
the best person to have around

14:31.584 --> 14:32.900
when you're looking to get laid.

14:32.923 --> 14:35.264
Was that your choice or his ?

14:35.634 --> 14:39.015
It was mutual.
I'm strictly his manager now.

14:39.015 --> 14:41.911
So if you weren't in his suite,
where did you go ?

14:41.911 --> 14:44.637
I was taking care of business.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.069
Checked the boys in,

14:46.100 --> 14:48.169
made sure the suite was copasetic,

14:48.300 --> 14:50.332
had a drink at Skin,

14:50.953 --> 14:55.392
and played pai gow
until hotel security came to get me.

14:55.798 --> 14:58.193
So how did you get to be his manager ?

14:59.220 --> 15:01.444
When I was with him,
he was broke.

15:01.799 --> 15:05.080
Then after the divorce, I still...

15:05.080 --> 15:08.718
did his laundry, paid his bills,
read his scripts.

15:09.128 --> 15:11.312
After a while, I wanted to get paid.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.365
Now I get ten percent of everything.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.457
L ook...

15:17.457 --> 15:21.576
I need to make some calls.
Julian's parents, the studio...

15:21.576 --> 15:22.819
Can we talk about this later ?

15:22.819 --> 15:26.117
Sure. But I need your prints
and your DNA now.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.869
Tox shows low levels of cocaine,
alcohol and Prevalis.

15:30.869 --> 15:32.523
Rules out overdose.

15:32.523 --> 15:36.692
Really ? I guess he was just acting
about the clean-living part.

15:36.692 --> 15:38.771
- C.O.D.* ? (* Cause Of Death)
- Asphyxia.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.096
- Asphyxiated how ?
- I don't know.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.879
No broken hyoid.

15:42.879 --> 15:47.001
That and the absence of ligature marks
or bruises makes strangulation unlikely.

15:47.001 --> 15:49.500
Did you find any fibers
in his nose or mouth ?

15:49.500 --> 15:51.895
Nope.
That doesn't rule out suffocation.

15:51.895 --> 15:54.388
Killer could have used something
that didn't shed fibers.

15:54.388 --> 15:58.067
Or maybe they came from whoever he was rolling around with in bed.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.280
Found lubricant on his genitals,
probably from a condom,

16:02.280 --> 16:04.873
and minor abrasions on his penis,

16:04.873 --> 16:07.598
indicative of vigorous,
prolonged activity.

16:07.932 --> 16:11.611
Sex, drugs and movies : the American dream.

16:25.323 --> 16:29.125
Your stomach contents contain
alcohol and traces of triazolam.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.529
Try-as-a-what ?

16:30.529 --> 16:33.513
It's a sleeping pill, has you reading
the inside of your eyelids for a week.

16:33.513 --> 16:35.073
I didn't take any pills.

16:35.073 --> 16:37.310
We also found cocaine in your bloodstream.

16:37.311 --> 16:39.265
I guess you didn't take that, either ?

16:42.170 --> 16:45.236
So I did a couple of lines,
but I didn't take any pills.

16:45.236 --> 16:48.591
If I was gonna take a pill,
I would've popped E or a perc.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.508
Miss Villa, we found you
in Julian Harper's suite.

16:51.508 --> 16:53.295
Were you ever in his bedroom ?

16:53.936 --> 16:55.568
Who knows ?

16:56.069 --> 16:58.453
I don't even know how
I ended up in Blinky's room.

16:59.039 --> 17:04.404
Oh, my... I swear,
if that guy slipped me something...

17:04.759 --> 17:06.471
Tell us what you do remember.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.531
Me and my girls were at Skin, and, uh...

17:15.531 --> 17:18.904
Blinky came over and said
he was partying with Julian Harper.

17:19.278 --> 17:23.215
And he said they had this pimpy booth,
so we went over.

17:29.110 --> 17:32.143
It didn't turn out the way I hoped.

17:35.342 --> 17:37.480
And the next thing I know,
Blinky's on top of me.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.878
We could assist you
in reporting a date rape.

17:42.913 --> 17:46.349
- Thanks, but no.
- It's not an offer, it's our job.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.799
There's this Stuff magazine
party at Ghost Bar tonight.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.488
I'm not gonna make it harder
for me to get in

17:51.489 --> 17:54.304
because I tattled on
Julian Harper's best friend.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.517
- I mean, if I run into them tonight...
- Julian Harper will not be there.

17:58.517 --> 18:00.136
Trust me, he will.

18:00.136 --> 18:04.474
The coroner finished the autopsy
early this morning.

18:06.446 --> 18:09.196
- He's dead ?
- Yeah.

18:11.849 --> 18:15.488
I was in Julian Harper's suite
when he died ?

18:16.548 --> 18:17.926
You're kidding me, right ?

18:17.926 --> 18:21.442
And being in his suite
makes you a suspect.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.944
- I am ?
- Yes.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.590
So we're going to need to take
a sample of your DNA.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.177
Man.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.242
I am so getting into that party
tonight for sure.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.937
Yeah, I remember that guy.

18:41.937 --> 18:44.297
He's, like, Chinese or something,
real spun out.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.730
He was on meth ?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.131
Well, he was on something.
He was acting all shady.

18:49.603 --> 18:52.608
Downed a bottle of soda
before he even paid for it.

18:52.608 --> 18:54.921
And that's how you knew
he was on something ?

18:54.921 --> 18:56.418
There ain't nothin' out here.

18:56.418 --> 18:59.479
People here act messed up
because they are messed up.

18:59.479 --> 19:03.743
The Metro Transit Board said that he caught
a Sunstar Taxi from this address.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.276
I called it for him.

19:05.276 --> 19:07.154
Anything to get that tweaker out of here.

19:07.154 --> 19:09.513
Any idea how he got here
in the first place ?

19:09.513 --> 19:12.315
All I saw him do was walk
through the door.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.909
Samay Thao.

19:14.909 --> 19:17.554
I don't even need to open him up
to guess C.O.D.

19:19.609 --> 19:21.745
Ocular inflammation.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.089
Laceration of the sclera.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.298
Hurts like hell when you get
a grain of sand in your eye.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.419
Imagine this.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.628
Bad night for Laotians.

19:47.628 --> 19:50.284
What other Laotians are having
a bad night ?

19:52.027 --> 19:54.815
Solo traffic collision on Mount Charleston.

19:54.815 --> 19:56.440
Came in early this morning.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.415
Noy Vipraxay.

19:59.215 --> 20:00.506
Vipraxay ?

20:01.700 --> 20:05.036
- Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.
- Does it mean something to you ?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.531
Yeah, he's got the same last name
as the guy who shot him.

20:08.531 --> 20:13.237
In fact, Grissom said that our vic over there
caught a cab at a gas station

20:13.237 --> 20:15.132
near Mount Charleston.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.149
I'll have auto detail bring in his car.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.027
Sounds like your double's becoming a triple.

20:19.027 --> 20:21.251
Unless you got any more in your drawers ?

20:21.479 --> 20:23.027
Hey, Archie.

20:23.027 --> 20:24.564
See if you can help me out.

20:24.564 --> 20:27.500
There was a smear on the window at the hotel.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.807
It came back saliva.

20:28.807 --> 20:35.121
So I ran it through CODIS, got a hit,
felony battery on this guy, Willie Angel.

20:35.121 --> 20:38.959
Now, he's a Las Vegas resident, but he wasn't a
registered guest at the hotel.

20:38.959 --> 20:43.219
He has no affiliation with Julian's
little entourage whatsoever.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.050
I think I scoped this guy earlier.

20:46.050 --> 20:48.219
- Really ?
- Yeah.
- Do it up.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.267
Yeah, there he is.

20:56.209 --> 20:58.390
- Looking dapper.
- All right.

21:00.435 --> 21:03.673
12:31 a.m.
Gets off on the high-roller floor.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.523
Hey, 2:45 a.m.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.180
Shopping bags ?

21:17.905 --> 21:21.939
There's no mall on that floor.
He was shopping at Julian Harper's.

21:21.939 --> 21:24.153
Enough time to shop and kill.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.779
The Palms issued two card keys...

21:27.779 --> 21:30.604
One to Julian, and one to his boy Blinky.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.338
But the database shows...

21:33.338 --> 21:34.618
one, two...

21:34.618 --> 21:37.878
three keys were used to access the suite ?

21:37.878 --> 21:40.572
Well, assuming the third card was Willie's.

21:40.700 --> 21:45.804
You can't just walk up to the front desk and
pull the "I lost my key" scam on a VIP suite.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.614
So... how'd Willie get it ?

21:56.100 --> 21:57.040
Sorry.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.969
I just started seeing someone.
Had a bit of a late night.

22:00.829 --> 22:02.386
Let me ask you something.

22:02.386 --> 22:06.749
How do you know when it's gone
from just friends to more than ?

22:07.669 --> 22:11.730
Well, if you have to ask...
It's just friends.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.627
She is making dinner for me this weekend.

22:13.627 --> 22:15.550
Are you the only guest ?

22:15.550 --> 22:17.516
Do her roommates count ?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.905
The splinter from your vic's eye
has four distinct layers.

22:24.905 --> 22:27.910
Polycarbonate plastic, aluminum,
acrylic and dye.

22:27.910 --> 22:31.630
Being an audiophile,
I prefer the sound of vinyl.

22:31.630 --> 22:33.527
It's from a compact disc ?

22:35.500 --> 22:39.121
Well, how did it end up in Samay Thao's eye ?

22:40.763 --> 22:43.898
Noy Vipraxay's car.

22:43.898 --> 22:45.895
Easy for you to say.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.669
Find anything ?

22:48.551 --> 22:49.755
Take a look at this.

22:49.755 --> 22:54.064
Gravitational pooling directly
under the steering wheel.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.758
The car was found at the bottom
of a steep incline.

23:01.758 --> 23:04.543
So he was leaning over it
when he bled out.

23:04.543 --> 23:06.100
Except he wasn't.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.760
Take a look.
See this.

23:09.069 --> 23:11.799
If he'd have bled out
in the position he was found,

23:11.799 --> 23:14.684
there'd be blood on the door,
not under the steering wheel.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.705
So someone moved the body ?

23:21.719 --> 23:26.296
There was plenty of mud at the scene,
and Samay had mud on his pants.

23:27.127 --> 23:29.481
Maybe we can match soil samples.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.960
Hang on.

23:33.700 --> 23:38.614
Trace came back on the splinter
that was in Samay's eye.

23:38.614 --> 23:40.777
It was a CD fragment.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.887
- Samay was in this car.
- Hey, guys.

23:46.887 --> 23:51.021
I got work card hits off prints from
the two dead Laotians and the shooter.

23:51.021 --> 23:52.058
We already know their IDs.

23:52.058 --> 23:55.322
Well, did you already know
that they all worked together ?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.924
- So Samay Thao worked for you ?
- Yeah, runs the dryers.

24:03.924 --> 24:05.746
When was the last time you saw him ?

24:05.746 --> 24:07.834
He's been off a couple days now.

24:08.866 --> 24:13.498
Did you know Noy or Keo Vipraxay ?

24:13.498 --> 24:15.281
Sure.
They work here, too.

24:15.281 --> 24:17.140
They brothers or cousins, or what ?

24:17.140 --> 24:22.097
Brothers. Keo's older.
I hear they got six more back in Laos.

24:22.097 --> 24:24.441
They work swing...
They're on at 4:00.

24:24.931 --> 24:29.019
- Were they friends of Samay's ?
- No ! No way.

24:29.978 --> 24:33.043
Keo and Noy are Lao Loum.
They're lowlanders.

24:33.043 --> 24:36.326
Samay's Hmong, he's in the hills.
They're born to hate each other.

24:36.326 --> 24:38.560
Some tribal crap.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.724
What kind of trouble are they in ?

24:40.724 --> 24:42.421
The kind where you stop breathing.

24:42.500 --> 24:48.166
Noy's dead... car accident. Samay's dead,
too... Keo shot him.

24:59.269 --> 25:03.522
- You speak Lao ?
- And Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog.

25:03.522 --> 25:05.543
I pulled a stint straight out of high school.

25:05.543 --> 25:07.953
I got Southeast Asia, lucky me.

25:07.953 --> 25:10.924
- Yeah, I know how you feel.
- Did Keo tell you what happened ?

25:10.924 --> 25:13.302
I mean, his English isn't very good.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.400
No, we're...
We're still waiting on an interpreter.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.460
If you need any help,
you let me know.

25:20.460 --> 25:23.303
Yeah, maybe...
Maybe I'll take you up on that.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.256
Willie Angel ?

25:57.823 --> 26:00.003
You can't fool the eye in the sky, Willie.

26:00.003 --> 26:02.157
There's a lot of people looking for you.

26:02.157 --> 26:05.958
Okay, you got me.
What do you want ?

26:06.700 --> 26:08.068
Hey, what are you doing ?

26:08.438 --> 26:11.213
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Oh, this here says we can.

26:17.308 --> 26:18.628
Slick Willie.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.441
Look out now.

26:21.603 --> 26:24.066
- You collect card keys, Willie ?
- I won at those places.

26:24.066 --> 26:25.750
- Really ?
- I hang on to them for good luck.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.925
Well, I bet you're real lucky with this cheap
magnetic stripe reader and palmtop ?

26:29.925 --> 26:32.646
You know you can get into most hotel rooms
in the city with this thing ?

26:32.646 --> 26:38.823
You take the old card key, you input the
room number, a little magnetic encoding...

26:39.600 --> 26:41.581
and Bob's your uncle.

26:45.600 --> 26:52.079
You used the card key to open the door.
Scopped around and hide.

26:52.079 --> 26:54.384
Julian comes back, falls asleep,

26:54.384 --> 26:57.395
and you tried to rob him blind
but he woke up.

26:57.395 --> 27:00.085
Kill him or go back to jail.
Right ?

27:00.085 --> 27:03.806
- Who the hell are you ?
- Stop, okay ? Stop.

27:05.900 --> 27:10.930
I was in his suite.
And, yeah, I'm a thief.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.420
But I didn't kill anybody.

27:12.420 --> 27:15.045
You were in his suite
for over two hours, man.

27:15.045 --> 27:18.184
That's more than enough time to snag
a couple shopping bags.

27:18.184 --> 27:21.436
'Cause that sick,
rich freak wasn't going to sleep.

27:21.923 --> 27:25.559
He was banging some blonde for,
like, two hours.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.908
- Talk to her.
- We're talking to you.

27:32.264 --> 27:33.591
I don't know what the hell
they were doing,

27:33.591 --> 27:35.905
but when she left, he wasn't moving.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.819
I thought he was asleep.

27:37.819 --> 27:40.013
Then I saw the news this morning.

27:41.150 --> 27:44.677
If it's a killer you're looking for,
talk to the girl in the red dress.

27:47.873 --> 27:51.900
We believe that Samay Thao killed your brother
and tried to make it look like an accident.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.758
Did you know about it ?

28:34.700 --> 28:38.401
He says he thought Samay was there to rob
him.

28:38.401 --> 28:40.754
That's why he shot him.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.422
The girl in the red dress gets off
with Julian's entourage at 12:57.

28:58.422 --> 29:01.922
Then she gets back on at 2:33.

29:01.922 --> 29:04.655
Certainly looks like
she's been through something rough.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.695
She forgot her pantyhose.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.048
- Good eyes.
- Great legs.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.436
Been a while, Arch.

29:14.436 --> 29:16.599
- Can you follow her out ?
- Yeah.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.089
I just got this footage...

29:18.089 --> 29:20.266
Hey, I heard you guys are having trouble
with the Julian Harper case.

29:20.266 --> 29:23.061
- Who'd you hear that from ?
- Ecklie. He's putting me on it.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.307
Man, you gotta quit kissing his ass.

29:25.700 --> 29:28.087
All right, fellas, check this out.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.528
Okay, that's Julian's manager.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.116
That's got to be at least a few Gs.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.389
- She a hooker ?
- I don't know, I think she could be the killer.

29:48.773 --> 29:50.850
Solicitation murder ?

29:50.850 --> 29:53.745
Manager pays to have her client whacked.

29:54.816 --> 29:57.996
- She went shopping.
- Wait a minute.

29:58.118 --> 30:01.763
What kind of hired killer takes their payoff
and goes to the mall ?

30:02.268 --> 30:03.434
I don't know.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.008
This one put herself on a mailing list.

30:09.598 --> 30:11.033
Tally Jordan.

30:11.033 --> 30:12.515
There's the phone number.

30:13.600 --> 30:18.202
You call my cell, I answer, we talk.

30:18.202 --> 30:21.742
And then you guys show up and arrest me at
the pool, in front of my friends.

30:21.742 --> 30:22.927
Is that fair ?

30:22.927 --> 30:25.562
You left Julian Harper's room at 2:33.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.885
A couple of minutes later,
you're taking money from his manager.

30:29.902 --> 30:33.718
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Couple hours later, Julian's dead.

30:37.150 --> 30:39.281
Okay, this is crazy.

30:39.687 --> 30:42.791
I would never even think
of killing Julian Harper.

30:43.055 --> 30:45.834
I've been a fan of his since
he was doing cereal commercials.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.672
So you stalked him ?
Is that it ?

30:48.900 --> 30:50.798
And then you killed him ?

30:54.900 --> 30:57.559
I'm in Vegas for a speech tournament...

30:57.559 --> 30:59.942
Okay, a school-supervised trip.

31:00.319 --> 31:03.021
Does that mean that my schoo
is stalking him, too ?

31:04.000 --> 31:08.400
Is the club Skin on your school schedule ?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.980
When I found out that Julian
was going to be in Vegas

31:13.980 --> 31:17.095
at the same time I was, I freaked.

31:18.180 --> 31:23.169
Okay, I wanted a look, an autograph,
or a picture at most.

31:24.095 --> 31:27.621
And what I got was incredible.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.490
Go for it.
You're the one he wants.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.009
It was like I was in one of his movies.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.519
Until he kicked me out of bed and...

31:45.519 --> 31:49.136
and then I get off the elevator,
and there's his manager handing me a wad of money.

31:50.472 --> 31:53.771
I tip all the girls Julian's with.

31:53.771 --> 31:56.809
So you're his pimp ?

31:56.809 --> 31:58.922
It keeps them
from running their mouths.

31:58.922 --> 32:02.363
It protects Julian's image.
It's just a part of managing his career.

32:02.363 --> 32:04.552
I had sex with Julian
because I wanted to.

32:04.552 --> 32:08.308
But you took the money,
and you bought a purse with it.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.480
I had a conversation with Julian's lawyer.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.083
And he said you weren't only his ex-wife,

32:14.083 --> 32:16.588
you were about to be his ex-manager.

32:16.588 --> 32:18.029
That piss you off ?

32:19.500 --> 32:22.410
His lawyers and his agents don't like me.

32:22.410 --> 32:24.182
They pressured him to drop me.

32:24.182 --> 32:27.709
But Julian and I are family.
That wasn't going to happen.

32:28.700 --> 32:32.412
Eva said if anyone asked,
Julian was a gentleman.

32:32.412 --> 32:35.647
Later he took me out and got me
a Katherine Baumann purse.

32:38.177 --> 32:40.472
It's a much better story to tell my friends.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.340
Samay and Noy go for a drive after work.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.598
They stop at Mount Charleston.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.377
Samay kills Noy...

33:02.700 --> 33:05.369
....and makes it look like an accident.

33:06.900 --> 33:12.125
And then he goes to Keo's apartment
and Keo shoots him, claiming self defense.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.051
I don't buy it.

33:13.051 --> 33:16.226
Keo shot him from the other side
of a locked door.

33:16.226 --> 33:18.039
He was waiting to blow the guy away.

33:18.039 --> 33:21.356
Which indicates that Keo
knew Samay was coming.

33:21.356 --> 33:25.914
Maybe he hired Samay to kill his brother,
and then he decided to cut him out of the deal.

33:25.914 --> 33:31.084
Noy had a life insurance policy issued
through his union, worth ten grand.

33:31.419 --> 33:33.729
Life's getting cheaper.
Who's the beneficiary ?

33:33.729 --> 33:39.490
Keo was the primary, but check this out.
Half the payout goes to Joe Cavanaugh.

33:42.429 --> 33:44.437
He's not a court-approved translator.

33:44.437 --> 33:46.028
That's why I taped it.

33:46.322 --> 33:48.028
I just didn't tell him.

33:49.338 --> 33:52.474
So far, he's saying what you asked him.

33:53.514 --> 33:56.881
- "You must help me."
- "That's why I'm here."

33:58.700 --> 34:00.607
"Just tell them what they want to know."

34:00.607 --> 34:02.552
This is the part that's different.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.291
"There are many things
I can tell him about you,"

34:07.291 --> 34:12.491
"so you tell him this :
Samay came to my home."

34:12.491 --> 34:13.982
"I was afraid."

34:13.982 --> 34:16.456
"I thought he was there to rob me or kill me."

34:16.456 --> 34:17.655
"So I shot him."

34:17.655 --> 34:19.953
So our interpreter is hiding something.

34:19.953 --> 34:22.359
Well, that's not lost in translation.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.071
Mr. Cavanaugh, can you come out here, please ?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.859
We're going to have a private chat.
Let's go.

34:49.902 --> 34:51.900
In the interview, remember Keo said :

34:51.900 --> 34:55.318
"There are many things
I can tell them about you" ?

34:55.318 --> 34:57.861
You didn't tell me that.
You left that part out. Why ?

34:57.861 --> 34:59.575
I told you what he said.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.327
You're not arresting me
because I screwed up my translation ?

35:02.327 --> 35:05.728
You're a co-beneficiary of
Noy Vipraxay's life insurance, right ?

35:05.728 --> 35:06.931
So what ?

35:06.931 --> 35:10.649
I help my guys try to get
a little security for their families.

35:10.649 --> 35:12.152
I help them in a lot of ways.

35:15.466 --> 35:17.084
Out of the goodness of your heart ?

35:17.084 --> 35:18.601
Come on, they have to come to you.

35:18.601 --> 35:21.622
Without me, they're back in a rice paddy
making three cents a day.

35:21.622 --> 35:24.263
Look, some of these guys
put me on their policy.

35:24.263 --> 35:25.540
It's their way of saying "thank you."

35:25.540 --> 35:28.789
So when one of your guys kills another one
of your guys, you make money out of it ?

35:28.789 --> 35:30.569
We both know that insurance companies

35:30.570 --> 35:33.045
don't even investigate claims
under ten grand.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.101
So you get a free pass.

35:35.101 --> 35:37.781
You don't really think I'd have somebody
killed for five grand ?

35:37.781 --> 35:40.768
- I've seen it done for a lot less.
- That don't mean I did it.

35:41.975 --> 35:44.661
There's new casinos that open all the time.

35:44.661 --> 35:46.554
They all got laundries.

35:46.554 --> 35:49.490
I bring home 15 G's a month on the side.

35:49.490 --> 35:53.549
So I am not going to bend over a dollar to
pick up a dime.

35:55.279 --> 36:01.032
Hodges, do you have the results on the
fibers that we dropped off to... ?

36:04.650 --> 36:06.076
Hodges ?

36:07.740 --> 36:09.112
He's asleep.

36:13.950 --> 36:17.773
Let me guess, the fibers are wool !

36:17.773 --> 36:19.563
Are you bagging Z's right now, man ?

36:19.563 --> 36:21.893
- I was just having the greatest dream.
- You were out.

36:21.893 --> 36:23.941
It was the '80s and I had this Don Johnson beard,

36:23.941 --> 36:26.300
you know, the "Miami Vice" stubble.

36:26.302 --> 36:30.256
It just gave me this air of danger.
My lady loved it.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.698
I found two types of fibers
on your guy's chin.

36:36.698 --> 36:40.946
Cotton and a polyester-lycra blend.
Both dyed black.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.980
Dyed black ?

36:44.613 --> 36:47.034
The bedding might have been cotton,
but it wasn't black.

36:47.034 --> 36:50.942
The comforter and draperies may have been
poly, but they weren't black, either.

36:50.942 --> 36:54.458
I bagged some black socks
and some black pantyhose.

36:55.312 --> 36:57.960
This could be the source of the fibers.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.135
He wasn't suffocated with his crew sock.

37:05.200 --> 37:09.213
Did you notice the burn mark on the knot
in these pantyhose at the crime scene ?

37:10.200 --> 37:13.687
No.
No, they were all balled up.

37:14.838 --> 37:16.921
I just bagged them and tagged them.

37:17.361 --> 37:18.615
Oh, yeah.

37:18.940 --> 37:21.195
Yeah, we've got to get this to DNA.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.033
I thought Greg was in the field.
Is he back in the lab ?

37:27.033 --> 37:28.892
- I don't know.
- We've got to clear this up.

37:28.892 --> 37:31.835
It's like he's confused.
Lab, field, field, lab.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.722
- We have a lab on wheels.
- How about you guys just shut up ?

37:35.141 --> 37:38.717
I'm doing this as a favor for Ecklie.
It's a one-time thing.

37:38.717 --> 37:42.248
- He's still interviewing lab techs.
- You making overtime ?

37:42.248 --> 37:44.442
I'm taking one for the team.

37:45.294 --> 37:46.947
Tell me about these pantyhose.

37:46.947 --> 37:50.084
Well, I found Tally's epithelials on the inside,

37:50.084 --> 37:52.969
which is no surprise,
since she was wearing them.

37:52.969 --> 37:56.496
I also found black cotton fibers
on the outside...

37:56.496 --> 37:59.482
highest concentration near the crotch.
Insert joke here.

37:59.482 --> 38:01.480
The vic had a pair of black cotton socks.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.930
Well, I did find black cotton fibers
under his chin.

38:05.930 --> 38:10.528
Okay, transfer from the sock
to the pantyhose, to the neck.

38:10.914 --> 38:14.497
So the sock was in
between the pantyhose and the neck ?

38:14.497 --> 38:15.408
Padding.

38:15.408 --> 38:18.224
BCP, Breath Control Play.

38:18.224 --> 38:21.460
Couples increase their partner's
pleasure through strangulation.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.107
And if you're not careful,
it leaves marks.

38:23.107 --> 38:25.613
Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's an actor,

38:25.613 --> 38:28.960
so I'm sure he didn't want bruises
on his neck to be showing on camera.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.881
There were only two girls in the suite.

38:30.882 --> 38:32.664
Which one of them killed him ?

38:32.750 --> 38:34.574
Burnt pantyhose.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.946
Okay, evidence of sex games gone wrong.

38:38.946 --> 38:40.744
I don't see how we could have missed anything.

38:40.744 --> 38:42.672
There's no fireplace here.

38:42.977 --> 38:45.021
I haven't seen any lighters.

38:45.598 --> 38:48.051
Well, something singed the hose.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.680
There's some burnt residue on this lamp.

39:15.112 --> 39:16.609
You know what I think ?

39:18.480 --> 39:24.956
I think someone tied him up, and they couldn't
get the knot undone, because it melted.

39:24.957 --> 39:26.555
So they panicked.

39:26.555 --> 39:28.908
And they pulled the hose down.

39:29.571 --> 39:31.635
I'll print the light.

39:32.370 --> 39:37.391
I guess even having an unlimited supply
of hot women is not enough ?

39:37.391 --> 39:40.250
Bondage sex with your best friend ?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.926
It's cool, you guys were on the down low*.

39:42.927 --> 39:42.927
* African-American slang.
Down low implies men that sleep with other men
but lead a straight or non-gay social life.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.218
I don't understand.

39:45.218 --> 39:50.778
Well, we found both your prints and Julian's
prints on a light fixture above the bed.

39:50.778 --> 39:54.095
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We were not down like that.

39:54.095 --> 39:57.634
Rise and shine, buddy !
Room service.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.507
Dude, Julian ?

40:10.373 --> 40:14.734
He did it to himself.
He did it to himself.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.482
So I took the pantyhose,
and I took them off the light.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.582
And then I put his boxers back on.

40:24.250 --> 40:28.394
I wasn't going to let his mom open up
Us magazine and see her boy like that.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.850
Jules, he always did me right.

40:34.707 --> 40:37.203
Now I just wanted to do him the same.

40:39.290 --> 40:42.376
I got the serial number run down
from Keo's shotgun.

40:42.376 --> 40:46.605
He bought it last week,
two days before he shot Samay.

40:46.605 --> 40:51.376
The guy's barely scraping by, and he
spends $250 on a brand-new Mossberg ?

40:51.376 --> 40:54.754
There's a word for that.
"Premeditation."

40:54.900 --> 40:56.019
Your brother gets killed.

40:56.019 --> 40:58.746
You killed the guy who did it
with a shotgun you just bought.

40:58.746 --> 41:01.610
And end up $5,000 ahead.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.081
In Nevada, that's murder one.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.569
20 years to life.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.249
Unless you get the death sentence.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.355
- What are my client's options ?
- A full confession.

41:20.355 --> 41:23.846
We make a recommendation to the DA,
maybe he gets murder two.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.790
I brought Noy here to help me.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.052
What ?

41:34.052 --> 41:36.176
To work hard and save.

41:36.937 --> 41:38.990
To bring our family here.

41:39.680 --> 41:40.956
Our parent.

41:41.978 --> 41:43.380
Our sister.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.418
My wife.

41:46.269 --> 41:48.195
Instead he waste the money.

41:49.423 --> 41:54.723
On the DVD, gambling, clothes.

41:56.681 --> 42:00.248
Noy's life was worthless.

42:01.909 --> 42:05.136
His death is not.

42:14.003 --> 42:16.729
Griss, we closed that actor case.

42:17.568 --> 42:18.364
And ?

42:18.365 --> 42:22.422
Accidental death as a result
of auto-erotic asphyxiation.

42:22.422 --> 42:25.670
Strangled himself to death
to enhance his own pleasure.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.211
It was in the days of public hangings

42:29.211 --> 42:31.876
that people first noticed
that men would get erections

42:31.876 --> 42:34.080
and sometimes even ejaculate.

42:34.300 --> 42:37.913
They called it "the killer orgasm."

42:39.400 --> 42:40.768
It's a waste.

42:40.768 --> 42:42.557
Guy had everything... money, fame...

42:42.557 --> 42:46.193
Yeah, look where he ended up.

42:46.194 --> 42:50.122
<i> All around me are familiar faces</i>

42:50.122 --> 42:56.497
<i>Worn out places, worn out faces</i>

42:56.497 --> 43:01.123
<i>Bright and early for their daily races</i>

43:01.124 --> 43:07.528
<i>Going nowhere, going nowhere</i>

43:08.095 --> 43:11.261
<i>Mad world</i>
