01:06.847 --> 01:10.374
<i>Three million years from Earth,</i>
<i>the mining ship Red Dwarf.</i>

01:10.517 --> 01:14.214
<i>Its crew: Dave Lister,</i>
<i>the last human being alive, :</i>

01:14.354 --> 01:17.517
<i>Arnold Rimmer, a hologram</i>
<i>of his dead bunkmate, :</i>

01:17.657 --> 01:20.956
<i>And a creature who evolved</i>
<i>from the ship's cat. Message ends.</i>

01:23.430 --> 01:26.922
<i>Additional. Our biggest enemy is going</i>
<i>space-crazy through loneliness.</i>

01:27.067 --> 01:30.093
<i>The only thing that helps me maintain</i>
<i>my grip on reality</i>

01:30.237 --> 01:34.435
<i>is the friendship I share</i>
<i>with my singing potatoes.</i>

01:35.242 --> 01:40.145
Nineteen. "When you are alone in bed,
what do you wear?

01:40.280 --> 01:44.080
"Is it: A, nothing at all;
B, a flannelette nightie;

01:44.217 --> 01:47.709
"or C, a sexy black negligee?"

01:47.854 --> 01:49.913
C.

01:50.056 --> 01:54.083
Twenty. "Do you think your boobs are...
A, too small;

01:54.227 --> 01:57.993
"B, just right; or C, too large?"

01:59.332 --> 02:01.425
Definitely too large!

02:02.068 --> 02:07.472
So, what's my rating? "Mainly Cs.
You sure are one foxy lady.

02:07.607 --> 02:10.872
"Sexy, sensual and don't mind showing it."

02:11.011 --> 02:13.878
Yes! I'm a sex beast!

02:14.014 --> 02:16.005
(CAT WAILS TUNELESSLY)

02:18.585 --> 02:20.314
Do you mind?!

02:20.454 --> 02:23.514
- What?
- I'm trying to concentrate.

02:23.657 --> 02:27.423
- (WAILS) I can't hear you.
- What are you listening to?

02:27.561 --> 02:30.029
It's hot, man. (WAILS)

02:30.163 --> 02:34.065
"Robert Hardy reads
Tess Of The D'Urbervilles"?!

02:34.901 --> 02:36.892
Let's have a listen.

02:39.005 --> 02:40.996
(BOTH WAIL TUNELESSLY)

02:43.009 --> 02:46.877
The tape must have got twisted, man!
This is really good!

02:47.714 --> 02:50.012
(SHOUTS) Excuse me!

02:50.150 --> 02:54.746
I'm in the middle of a calculation,
which could swing the game.

02:54.888 --> 02:58.847
- Rimmer, you've lost, man.
- There's plenty of play.

02:58.992 --> 03:04.089
- There's one move, then he zaps you.
- Admittedly, that is how it looks.

03:04.231 --> 03:06.290
But you're not taking into consideration

03:06.433 --> 03:12.303
that El Skutto here has to go back
on duty in four minutes, 31 seconds,

03:12.439 --> 03:16.933
and if he goes before the game finishes,
I win by default.

03:17.077 --> 03:19.011
Four minutes, 15.

03:19.145 --> 03:22.114
(CHANTS) Rimmer! Rimmer!

03:24.784 --> 03:28.413
You're a piece of dirty, filthy,
cheating scum, aren't you?

03:28.555 --> 03:31.080
Absolutement! That's why I'll win,

03:31.224 --> 03:33.784
because I think my way round problems,

03:33.927 --> 03:37.658
rather than sticking
to the pre-programmed lines.

03:37.797 --> 03:39.765
That's why men are better than machines.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.859
Oh, I don't know. I had
this geography teacher, Miss Foster.

03:44.004 --> 03:49.032
She took us camping to Deganwy.
I had the tent next to hers, right?

03:49.175 --> 03:53.771
In the night, I was woken up
by this really weird noise.

03:53.914 --> 03:57.350
SHE didn't think
men were better than machines.

03:57.484 --> 04:00.544
<i>- What's happening, then, dudes?</i>
- Bog all.

04:00.687 --> 04:05.920
<i>- I forgot what I was going to say.</i>
- It can't be important, then.

04:06.059 --> 04:08.050
(THUNDEROUS CRASH)

04:09.296 --> 04:14.029
<i>That's it. "Look out,</i>
<i>a meteor is about to hit the ship. "</i>

04:15.035 --> 04:18.300
<i>- I knew it would come back to me.</i>
- Thanks!

04:18.438 --> 04:21.805
<i>- Sorry.</i>
- What's wrong with you, Holly?

04:21.942 --> 04:25.036
- He's computer-senile.
- Is there any damage?

04:25.178 --> 04:28.045
<i>I don't know. The damage report</i>
<i>machine's damaged.</i>

04:28.181 --> 04:31.981
- Where did it hit?
<i>- All my monitors are out.</i>

04:32.118 --> 04:35.110
<i>Round about floor 591, I think.</i>

04:35.255 --> 04:39.191
You're as much use
as a condom machine in the Vatican.

04:48.935 --> 04:50.266
There's nothing here. Let's try 592.

04:53.673 --> 04:56.904
Er... Has anybody seen my legs?

04:57.043 --> 05:00.604
They're not below my waist
where I normally keep them.

05:00.747 --> 05:05.810
- Holly, where are Rimmer's legs?
- Here they are right here!

05:05.952 --> 05:08.716
- Stop them!
- C'mon, leggies. Over here.

05:08.855 --> 05:13.690
<i>Of course. 592. That's where</i>
<i>the hologram simulation suite is.</i>

05:14.861 --> 05:18.319
- What does this mean?
<i>- It's probably not serious.</i>

05:18.465 --> 05:23.095
If it's not serious when your genitals
wander off on their own, what is?

05:30.610 --> 05:33.602
Wait for me-me-me-me-me-me!

05:36.149 --> 05:38.617
<i>Here it is. 592.</i>

05:38.752 --> 05:41.414
Rimmer, are you all right?

05:46.359 --> 05:50.955
(ODD HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Well, you see, the shuttle was late.

05:51.097 --> 05:55.693
And they're usually so good.
They're so good. They're brilliant.

05:55.835 --> 05:57.803
What's happened to him?

05:57.937 --> 06:02.306
- He's Brannigan, ship's psychiatrist.
<i>- We'd better get him fixed.</i>

06:02.442 --> 06:04.933
(ALARM BEEPS)

06:09.315 --> 06:12.250
<i>I've got it in hand. No panic.</i>

06:13.219 --> 06:15.346
(AS HOLLY) No panic everyone.
I've got it in hand.

06:15.488 --> 06:18.252
<i>(HOLLY) Just override the charred relays.</i>

06:18.391 --> 06:21.849
- Just override the charred relays.
- How do you do that?

06:21.995 --> 06:26.694
- (AS LISTER) How do you do that?
<i>- Bypass the main circuit.</i>

06:26.833 --> 06:29.233
(AS HOLLY) Bypass the main circuit.

06:29.369 --> 06:31.394
- This one?
- (AS LISTER) This one?

06:31.538 --> 06:33.506
<i>- Yeah, that one.</i>
- Yeah, that one.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.269
<i>- Now press the bypass.</i>
- Now press the bypass.

06:37.410 --> 06:42.040
(YELPS) That was horrible.
I never want to go through that again!

06:42.182 --> 06:46.118
Aow! Aow!

06:46.252 --> 06:48.482
Hey! Now he's me!

06:48.621 --> 06:51.419
<i>Stick the red plug in the blue socket.</i>

06:54.060 --> 06:55.322
(RIMMER YELPS)

06:56.629 --> 06:59.029
- Am I OK now?
<i>- (HOLLY) Yeah.</i>

06:59.165 --> 07:01.156
Shouldn't this plug into something?

07:01.301 --> 07:04.930
<i>Oh, yeah, that joins up with the white cable.</i>

07:06.005 --> 07:08.496
(CRACKLING, LISTER YELLS)

07:16.616 --> 07:19.244
<i>... or is it the yellow cable?</i>

07:19.385 --> 07:21.615
<i>Yes, it should have been yellow.</i>

07:28.928 --> 07:31.954
You are a total, total...

07:32.098 --> 07:36.000
a word has yet to be invented
to describe you, but you are one,

07:36.136 --> 07:38.798
and a total one at that.

07:39.606 --> 07:41.096
<i>Keep your hair on.</i>

07:41.241 --> 07:45.507
- I'm lucky to keep my legs on.
- He's out to lunch.

07:45.645 --> 07:50.947
He's out to lunch, breakfast, dinner, the lot!
He's not in for a single meal.

07:51.084 --> 07:54.952
- Hey, who's that?
- Aliens!

07:56.289 --> 07:58.780
<i>- Queegl</i>
- Who's Queeg?

07:58.925 --> 08:02.258
<i>I'm Queeg 500, the back-up computer.</i>

08:02.395 --> 08:05.296
<i>All vessels of</i>
<i>the Jupiter Mining Corporation fleet</i>

<i>carry a back-up computer</i>
<i>to replace the primary computer</i>

08:08.768 --> 08:11.965
<i>if the primary computer contravenes Article 5.</i>

08:12.105 --> 08:14.471
<i>I am therefore assuming control.</i>

08:14.607 --> 08:17.371
<i>This is mutiny, Mr Queeg.</i>

08:17.510 --> 08:22.379
<i>You'll swing from the highest yardarm</i>
<i>in Titan Docking Port for this.</i>

08:22.515 --> 08:24.244
What's Article 5?

08:24.384 --> 08:27.581
<i>Gross negligence, leading to</i>
<i>the endangerment of personnel.</i>

08:27.720 --> 08:32.157
- But Holly has an IQ of 6,000!
<i>- (HOLLY) Right on.</i>

08:32.292 --> 08:35.419
<i>- Is that what he told you?</i>
- Well, what is it?

08:35.562 --> 08:39.157
<i>It has a six in it, but it's not 6,000.</i>

08:39.299 --> 08:42.700
- What is it?
<i>- Six.</i>

08:42.836 --> 08:47.330
<i>Six? Do me a lemonl</i>
<i>That's a poor IQ for a glass of waterl</i>

08:47.473 --> 08:51.671
How come he knows all about science
and space when we ask him?

08:51.811 --> 08:54.780
<i>- He consults a book.</i>
<i>- What a slimeballl</i>

08:54.914 --> 08:59.476
<i>He gets all his information</i>
<i>on science from a single book.</i>

09:00.053 --> 09:04.353
- What book?
<i>- Junior Encyclopedia Of Space.</i>

09:04.490 --> 09:06.720
<i>It's the only one he could find with pictures.</i>

09:07.460 --> 09:11.419
<i>That's slander, that is.</i>
<i>You'd better find a good lawyer, guy.</i>

09:11.564 --> 09:15.091
- That's why he's never on the case!
<i>- I am on the case.</i>

09:15.235 --> 09:17.260
<i>I'm sharp. I'm kicking bottom.</i>

09:18.371 --> 09:20.396
How come he can navigate us back to Earth?

09:20.540 --> 09:24.442
<i>He can't. You've been going around</i>
<i>in circles for 14 months.</i>

09:24.577 --> 09:28.343
- You what?
<i>- A load of Tottenham, that is.</i>

09:28.481 --> 09:31.245
<i>A steaming pile of Hotspur.</i>

09:31.384 --> 09:34.911
<i>I'm on to his game. He's turning you</i>
<i>against me, so he can take over.</i>

09:35.054 --> 09:38.490
<i>No discussions. The decision has been made.</i>

09:38.625 --> 09:41.492
<i>You've been bypassed. You've been retired.</i>

09:41.628 --> 09:45.029
<i>- I'm in my primel</i>
<i>- You'll be night watchman.</i>

09:45.164 --> 09:50.033
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>Red Dwarf is run by Queeg 500.</i>

10:04.317 --> 10:07.650
<i>Queeg to all personnel.</i>
<i>Course redirection implemented.</i>

10:07.787 --> 10:12.383
<i>New bearing 057-7766. Message ends.</i>

10:14.761 --> 10:17.093
Ah, Lister, this is a bit different, isn't it?

10:17.230 --> 10:21.792
See those skutters, charging up
and down the corridor, repairing, sweeping?

10:21.935 --> 10:24.836
The lifts are fixed. The fire extinguishers work.

10:24.971 --> 10:27.701
And I mean they work
when you turn them on,

10:27.840 --> 10:32.334
as opposed to when you happen
to pass them and cough.

10:32.478 --> 10:34.742
Yeah, I suppose.

10:34.881 --> 10:40.342
There's no point feeling sorry
about Holly. It's a kindness.

10:40.486 --> 10:44.013
He's like an old incontinent sheepdog
who's had his day.

10:45.825 --> 10:50.922
Take him out to the barn
with a shotgun and blow the mother away.

10:51.864 --> 10:55.197
I'm only saying that because I'm fond of him.

10:55.335 --> 11:00.102
- How do you think Holly feels?
- He doesn't feel anything. He's a computer.

11:00.239 --> 11:02.173
He still feels.

11:02.308 --> 11:06.210
Sometimes I think it's cruel
giving machines a personality.

11:06.346 --> 11:09.838
My mate bought a pair of shoes
with artificial intelligence.

11:09.983 --> 11:12.952
Smart Shoes, they were called.

11:13.086 --> 11:17.819
No matter how blind drunk you were,
they could always get you home.

11:17.957 --> 11:22.257
He got ratted one night in Oslo,
and woke up the next morning in Burma.

11:22.395 --> 11:27.662
See, the shoes got bored.
They wanted to see the world.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.258
He couldn't get rid of them.
Whenever he sold them,

11:31.404 --> 11:36.467
they'd show up again the next day
and kick the door down.

11:36.609 --> 11:40.636
- Is this true?
- Yeah. Last thing he heard,

11:40.780 --> 11:43.578
they'd robbed a car and driven into a canal.

11:43.716 --> 11:47.709
- They couldn't steer.
- Really?

11:47.854 --> 11:53.156
Yeah. Petersen was blown away
about by it. He went to see a priest.

11:53.292 --> 11:58.025
He said that the shoes had gone to heaven.

11:58.164 --> 12:00.894
It turns out shoes have "souls".

12:01.868 --> 12:04.996
Well, what a sad, sad story.

12:06.639 --> 12:09.039
Wait a minute...

12:09.175 --> 12:12.167
How did they open the car door?

12:36.302 --> 12:38.236
(ALARM SOUNDS)

12:38.371 --> 12:39.633
Off!

12:44.811 --> 12:49.145
Uh, Queeg? Why has my alarm clock
gone off at six o'clock?

12:49.282 --> 12:51.512
<i>That's the time you asked for.</i>

12:51.651 --> 12:54.586
Holly and I had this little understanding.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.212
I'd say, "Wake me up at six without fail,"

12:58.357 --> 13:04.353
then Holly would pretend to forget,
and wake me around ten with breakfast. OK?

13:07.700 --> 13:08.962
(ALARM SOUNDS)

13:09.102 --> 13:10.433
Off!

13:12.338 --> 13:15.671
Queeg, I can see we've already
cultivated a special understanding -

13:15.808 --> 13:20.177
I scratch your back and
you stick a knife in mine.

13:20.313 --> 13:23.146
- Give me a uniform.
<i>- Exercises first.</i>

13:23.282 --> 13:29.551
Ah, yes. Now once again,
Holly and I had this understanding...

13:29.689 --> 13:34.149
- <i>(QUEEG) Move it, boyl</i>
- What are you doing?!

13:34.293 --> 13:38.195
<i>I'm putting you</i>
<i>through the regulation 500 jerks.</i>

13:38.331 --> 13:41.892

<i>- Then it's a three-mile run.</i>

13:42.034 --> 13:45.197
You just can't take control of my body!

13:47.974 --> 13:50.408
<i>In space, I AM the company.</i>

13:50.543 --> 13:53.944
- Lister, wake up! Help!
- What's going on?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.844
Queeg! He's making me fit!

13:56.983 --> 14:01.317
What are you doing?!
My stomach won't take it! It's too flabby!

14:01.454 --> 14:03.081

- Holly and I had an understanding!

14:08.628 --> 14:11.153
Yes! Fight that flab!

14:12.565 --> 14:18.504
I want my body back! Three more hours
will kill me! I'm going to faint!

14:20.439 --> 14:24.637
I said food! Is anybody home?

14:42.428 --> 14:46.990
- What's the matter with him?
<i>- He fainted after the 500 yards.</i>

14:47.133 --> 14:51.593
- You made him jog unconscious?
<i>- It's regulations.</i>

14:51.737 --> 14:53.898
Yes! Nice one, Queeg!

14:54.040 --> 14:59.137

- I did. "You have run out of credits."

15:31.544 --> 15:35.344

<i>- lf you want food, you have to work.</i>
- Work?!

15:50.730 --> 15:53.756
You'd better start. I'm one hungry pussycat.

15:53.899 --> 15:57.892
<i>- Both of you.</i>
- Whoa! I don't do the "W" word.

15:58.037 --> 16:02.804
Cats do NOT work!
I've got a note from my mommy.

16:02.942 --> 16:08.175
<i>- From now on, EVERYBODY worksl</i>
- Not this pussy!

16:08.314 --> 16:10.874
I can't believe I'm doing this!

16:11.017 --> 16:15.511
Look at me! I'm disgusting!
I'm like you in your best clothes!

16:15.655 --> 16:19.523
Look, it's easy.
Just imagine the floor is Queeg's face.

16:19.659 --> 16:21.650
(BOTH SPIT)

16:22.662 --> 16:25.893
Aw, look at my hands! I had lovely hands!

16:26.032 --> 16:31.299
- Well, wear the smegging gloves!
- Marigolds with blue? Are you crazy?

16:32.305 --> 16:37.038
- How long do we have to do this?
- It's only been ten minutes.

16:37.176 --> 16:40.509
- We've got to do it all day.
- What?! All day?

16:40.646 --> 16:45.413
The whole day? I'm a cat.

16:45.551 --> 16:50.989
If I don't nap, I don't have
enough energy for my main snooze.

16:52.692 --> 16:55.855
<i>Haltl Who goes there? Friend or foe?</i>

16:56.462 --> 16:58.862
- Holly!
- How you doin'?

16:58.998 --> 17:01.398
Let me wipe your screen.

17:02.468 --> 17:05.096
- So, how's it going?
- What you been up to, man?

17:05.237 --> 17:08.694
<i>Oh, this night watchman lark</i>
<i>keeps me busy.</i>

17:08.840 --> 17:10.968
<i>Shining me torch down corridors.</i>

17:11.109 --> 17:15.877
<i>Turning it off. Shining it again.</i>
<i>Life's pretty full.</i>

17:16.015 --> 17:19.212
- Help us, Hol.
- Queeg has got to go!

17:19.352 --> 17:22.685
Look at my cuticles. He's a maniac.

17:23.556 --> 17:26.116
(BREATHLESS) I agree!

17:26.258 --> 17:28.521
He's got us working for food.

17:29.061 --> 17:31.359
<i>Well, no doubt he knows what he's doing,</i>

17:31.497 --> 17:35.092
<i>unlike certain senile wrecks</i>
<i>of computers we could mention.</i>

17:35.234 --> 17:38.533
<i>Still, it was nice how everyone defended me.</i>

17:38.671 --> 17:41.640
<i>- Different story now.</i>
- I defended you.

17:41.774 --> 17:45.107
<i>I remember.</i>
<i>Queeg says I've got an IQ of six,</i>

17:45.244 --> 17:49.681
<i>and you leap to my defense, saying,</i>
<i>"Really? That explains everythingl"</i>

17:49.815 --> 17:52.875
- No. That was Rimmer!
<i>- Nevertheless,</i>

17:53.018 --> 17:56.613
<i>certain characters don't believe</i>
<i>my IQ is 6,000.</i>

17:56.756 --> 17:59.919
- I believe you.
<i>- I could prove it.</i>

18:00.059 --> 18:03.825
- There's no need.
<i>- I want to.</i>

18:03.963 --> 18:06.989
OK, what's the square root of 2,049?

18:07.133 --> 18:10.830
<i>- Oh, you want me to prove it?</i>
- No, no.

18:10.970 --> 18:16.067
<i>Clearly doing the square root of 2,049</i>
<i>will prove I have an IQ of 6,000.</i>

18:16.208 --> 18:20.577
- What is it?
<i>- You wouldn't prefer a sports question?</i>

18:20.713 --> 18:25.673
- Forget it. It's not important.
<i>- It is to me. I want to clear my name.</i>

18:25.818 --> 18:29.754
Well, what is the square root of 2,049?

18:29.889 --> 18:33.655
<i>- How about a space question?</i>
- Like what?

18:33.793 --> 18:36.455
<i>Like, "What's the nearest planet to the sun?"</i>

18:36.595 --> 18:40.827
- What's the nearest planet to the sun?
<i>- Easy-peasy.</i>

18:40.966 --> 18:43.799
<i>That's right down</i>
<i>my particular field of expertise.</i>

18:43.936 --> 18:48.066
<i>Your nearest basic planet</i>
<i>to your actual sun is...</i>

18:53.813 --> 18:55.280
<i>Mercury.</i>

18:55.414 --> 18:58.144
- That's right.
<i>- Ye of little faith.</i>

18:58.284 --> 19:02.721
- Well, I'm convinced.
- Me, too. Can we get rid of Queeg?

19:02.855 --> 19:06.256
<i>Do you believe</i>
<i>I'm the right dude for the gig?</i>

19:07.026 --> 19:09.995
- Yeah.
<i>- I'll be in touch.</i>

19:10.129 --> 19:13.189
(WHISTLES GREAT ESCAPE THEME)

19:31.317 --> 19:33.842
He's taking the smeg!

19:33.986 --> 19:37.149
- Who is?
- Queeg. Look at what he's given me.

19:37.289 --> 19:41.157
A pea on toast. One pea.

19:41.293 --> 19:44.285
I tell you, I'm that far from cracking.

19:50.336 --> 19:52.964
I've lost me pea!

19:53.105 --> 19:55.972
Oh, that's it! I've cracked.

19:56.675 --> 19:59.667
He's just doing this to destroy your morale.

19:59.812 --> 20:05.273
Is he? Well, I want me pea back.
I earned that pea!

20:05.417 --> 20:10.411
Where is it? I don't care if it's
under the bed with me toenail clippings,

20:10.556 --> 20:16.222
I earned it. I'm going to eat it, no matter what.

20:16.362 --> 20:19.126
It flew into your dirty sock basket.

20:20.499 --> 20:22.694
I'll just have the toast.

20:24.336 --> 20:27.897
- Why didn't we stick up for Holly?
- I did.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.099
You did?! When?

20:30.242 --> 20:34.372
- All right, I didn't.
- Nobody did. It's terrible.

20:34.513 --> 20:36.743
We thought we'd get something better.

20:36.882 --> 20:39.942
What about trust? What about fidelity?

20:40.085 --> 20:43.020
What about simple, basic, honest friendship?

20:43.155 --> 20:48.991
Friendship? Do you know how many people
I can count as true friends?

20:49.128 --> 20:53.224
Well, if you count Inflatable Ingrid,
your Polythene Pal, one.

20:56.302 --> 20:57.997
I'll tell you.

21:01.373 --> 21:05.173
None.
I got burned once and I learned my lesson.

21:05.311 --> 21:07.836
Don't trust anybody.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.972
There was this one lad, Porky Roebuck.

21:11.116 --> 21:14.017
I'd known him ten years. We were almost family.

21:14.153 --> 21:18.556
His dad was knocking off my mum,
that's how close we were.

21:18.691 --> 21:22.525
- We were in the Space Scouts together.
- Space Scouts?

21:22.661 --> 21:26.597
Oh, yes... Pinkle! Squirmy! Blip-blap-blap!

21:26.732 --> 21:30.998
We were 15 years old.
We went on this survival course,

21:31.136 --> 21:34.503
sleeping rough,
surviving on wild berries and rainwater.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.804
- Where did you go? Butlins?
- We each got a Swiss Army knife.

21:38.944 --> 21:42.004
You only ate what you killed yourself.

21:43.215 --> 21:46.582
Ten boys got together and decided to eat me.

21:48.721 --> 21:53.886
They tied me to a stake, lit a fire
and poured barbecue sauce all over me.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.588
I remember thinking as I went round and round,

21:57.730 --> 22:00.893
"Porky will save me. He's my best friend."

22:01.033 --> 22:06.403
It turned out Porky was the ringleader
and had bagsied my right buttock.

22:06.538 --> 22:11.032
If it wasn't for the Space Mistress,
they really would have eaten me.

22:11.176 --> 22:14.771
Oh, come on. They were only bullying you.

22:14.913 --> 22:17.245
You know what kids are like.

22:18.817 --> 22:22.947
The point is, friends are only friends
when it suits them.

22:23.088 --> 22:24.612
Oh... Lights.

22:26.492 --> 22:28.289
- Lister?
- Yeah?

22:28.427 --> 22:31.225
How did you know about Inflatable Ingrid?

22:31.363 --> 22:34.890
I've been seeing her behind your back.

22:47.646 --> 22:49.477
<i>- Compute.</i>
- Compute.

22:49.615 --> 22:53.016
<i>The product of the correlation of vx/dy</i>

22:59.291 --> 23:01.657

<i>- Yes?</i>

23:01.794 --> 23:04.262
What does "compute" mean?

<i>- You'll have to fight for her.</i>

23:44.536 --> 23:46.697
Hol, this man's a nutter.

23:46.839 --> 23:51.902
<i>- I challenge you to the game of your choice.</i>
- Oh, my God.

23:52.044 --> 23:55.241
<i>- The winner gets command of Red Dwarf.</i>
<i>- And the loser?</i>

23:55.380 --> 23:58.372
<i>The loser will be erased,</i>
<i>terminated, oblivionised.</i>

23:59.118 --> 24:01.814
- Bye-bye, baldy.

24:01.954 --> 24:04.479
<i>- Chess.</i>
<i>- Any game.</i>

<i>- Draughts, poker... anything.</i>

24:07.526 --> 24:09.858
<i>- Chess.</i>
<i>- Subbuteo, snakes and ladders...</i>

24:09.995 --> 24:12.793

<i>- Monopoly, maybe?</i>

24:12.931 --> 24:15.957

24:16.101 --> 24:18.433

Don't do this. You'll get rubbed.

<i>A computer's gotta do what a computer's</i>

24:32.918 --> 24:35.216
It's called a knight, actually, Holly.

24:35.354 --> 24:39.814
<i>- Knight to King Bishop 3.</i>
<i>- Queen to Rook 8. Checkmate.</i>

24:39.958 --> 24:44.793
<i>- That's an illegal move.</i>
<i>- Oh, sorry. I was thinking of poker.</i>

24:46.899 --> 24:49.060
<i>Cluedo? You can be Colonel Mustard.</i>

24:49.735 --> 24:53.364
Psst! If it's any help,
I've been studying his tactics

24:53.505 --> 24:59.535
and there's a pattern - every time
you make a move, he makes one, too.

- What kind of plan was that?
- A stupid plan, that's what it was.

26:08.013 --> 26:11.471
- Why didn't we stop him?
- We thought he had something up his sleeve.

26:11.617 --> 26:15.280
Now we've got Queeg forever,
