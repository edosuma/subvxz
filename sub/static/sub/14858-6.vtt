ELLEN: "Mr. Mittens realized
the black cat chasing him"...

18:44.498 --> 18:45.579
Seriously, another "Q"?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.536
How many Quentins
are they expecting?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.826
--"And his new best friend."

18:50.129 --> 18:51.870
[APPLAUSE]

18:52.173 --> 18:54.255
That was great, Ellen.
Thank you.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.461
Is that a library book?
No.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.001
Speaking of library books,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.921
what is the deal
with library fines, huh?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.055
I'd rather have Ralph Fiennes,
right?

19:03.351 --> 19:04.432
[LAUGHING]

19:07.521 --> 19:09.683
[CHUCKLES]

19:09.982 --> 19:12.474
[CLEARS THROAT]
Next up we have Paul Petley

19:12.777 --> 19:14.814
reading If I Ran the Zoo
by Dr. Seuss.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.449
What if it were written
by Dr. Dre instead?

19:21.744 --> 19:24.736
Wouldn't be Hooked on Phonics,
it'd be Hooked on Chronic.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.282
[BRAD LAUGHING]

19:28.584 --> 19:29.915
Come on.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.829
All right, Paul Petley,
everyone. Okay.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.874
Actually, I'm not gonna be
reading If I Ran the Zoo now.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.010
Instead, I'm gonna be reading
a very special letter.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.599
"Dear Jane,
you are an amazing person.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.559
"I want to be you.
| used to go into your closet

19:51.857 --> 19:54.315
when you weren't around
and put on your clothes."

19:54.610 --> 19:56.726
Alrighty.
"You're my sister

19:57.029 --> 20:00.021
"and I never meant
to steal your spotlight.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.610
"You set such a high standard.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.617
"I've spent my whole life
trying to keep up.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.030
"You are an extra"--
"Extra"-- "Extraor"...

20:12.294 --> 20:15.832
"Extraordinary person

20:16.132 --> 20:18.419
and the best sister ever.
| love you."

20:20.386 --> 20:24.129
| am so sorry.
| feel like an idiot.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.719
It's just, I don't know,
sometimes I wanna be the one

20:27.017 --> 20:30.009
that comes in
and makes everyone laugh.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.303
| never should have
excluded you.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.644
It's okay.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.777
[WHISPERS] Honestly, I'm not
interested in any of this anyway.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.688
Okay, we can
talk about that later.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.231
Thanks.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.867
JANE: Ah, yeah.
PAUL: Thank you.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.119
[MOUTHS]
Thank you.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.951
[240]

20:59.133 --> 21:00.669
Whoa, hey.
What's your name?

21:00.968 --> 21:02.834
Kevin.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.050
Then why are you, uh, taking
the last "B" cookie, Kevin?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.510
I'm Brad, and that's my cookie.
Give me that.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.893
Mm.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.269
You should try one of these.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.354
Not today, though.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.904
Mm.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.190
What?

21:25.493 --> 21:26.858
Come on, we'll split it.

21:34.126 --> 21:34.206
