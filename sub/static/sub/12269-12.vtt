WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.216
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.148
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO TRUST YOU WITH THIS.

00:17.148 --> 00:18.589
(Patrick) NOLAN--
HE KEEPS THIS BOX LOCKED UP

00:18.589 --> 00:20.121
BEHIND THE PAINTING.
IT'S GOT THIS DESIGN.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.054
WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
 IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

00:23.054 --> 00:25.025
TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.197
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?

00:26.197 --> 00:27.698
(voice breaking) NOTHING.

00:27.698 --> 00:29.160
I SHOT HER.
I'M TURNING MYSELF IN.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.503
HE WILL CONFESS UNLESS WE ACT.
LYDIA GOES.

00:32.503 --> 00:34.805
(woman on TV) LYDIA DAVIS
 IS A PRIME SUSPECT

00:34.805 --> 00:36.667
IN THE SHOOTING
 OF EMILY GRAYSON.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.769
YOU STAY CLOSE TO EMILY.
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO--

00:38.769 --> 00:40.671
DON'T TRUST THE GRAYSONS.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.116
(gasps) DANIEL SHOT ME.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.620
(Emily) WHEN MY FATHER
 WAS IN PRISON,

00:49.620 --> 00:53.624
HE WROTE IN HIS JOURNALS
 ABOUT HOW THE VALUE OF LIFE

00:53.624 --> 00:57.758
CAN BE DIRECTLY MEASURED
 BY OUR WILL TO ENDURE,

00:57.758 --> 01:01.362
THAT WE HAVE A REMARKABLE
 ABILITY TO RESIST FATIGUE,

01:01.362 --> 01:04.235
TO WITHSTAND PAIN,

01:04.235 --> 01:06.167
TO KEEP FIGHTING,

01:06.167 --> 01:09.640
AS LONG AS WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT
 OF WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR.

01:10.701 --> 01:13.274
WITH THE QUEEN'S GUARD
POSTED OUTSIDE,

01:13.274 --> 01:15.406
I... HAD TO GET CREATIVE.

01:15.406 --> 01:18.509
OR MAYBE YOU'RE USING
THIS VISIT AS AN EXCUSE

01:18.509 --> 01:20.751
TO HAVE PURCHASED
THAT JACKET.

01:20.751 --> 01:22.213
YOU DO REMEMBER ME.

01:22.213 --> 01:24.585
OF COURSE I DO.
I'M FULLY RECOVERED.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.817
MENTALLY, ANYWAY.

01:26.817 --> 01:29.490
HOW'S AIDEN HANDLING
EVERYTHING?

01:29.490 --> 01:34.165
POORLY, BUT HE'S AGREED NOT
TO RETALIATE AGAINST DANIEL.

01:34.165 --> 01:35.566
(sighs)
 WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:35.566 --> 01:39.770
HOW WILL EMILY THORNE RETURN
WITH A VENGEANCE THIS TIME?

01:43.874 --> 01:45.406
SHE WON'T.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.181
IT'S OVER, NOLAN. I FAILED.

01:50.181 --> 01:51.782
YOU SURVIVED.

01:51.782 --> 01:53.614
I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.347
(sniffles) NOT AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

01:56.347 --> 01:58.849
I DON'T WANT TO.

01:58.849 --> 02:03.494
YOU KNOW THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT LOSING MY MEMORIES WAS...

02:06.157 --> 02:09.128
HAVING TO RELIVE THEM
AS THEY CAME BACK.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.502
SO MUCH PAIN.

02:11.502 --> 02:13.164
(inhales deeply)

02:14.605 --> 02:16.907
I JUST KNOW THAT I HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE,

02:16.907 --> 02:18.509
GET OUT OF THE HAMPTONS.

02:18.509 --> 02:21.542
HEY,
YOU HAVE TO HEAL FIRST.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.651
I'LL SEE YOU
ON MY NEXT ROUNDS.

02:33.524 --> 02:35.686
AS LONG AS SHE'S IN THERE,
SHE'S SAFE.

02:35.686 --> 02:38.289
LOOK, NIKO, I'M BEYOND GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR HELP,

02:38.289 --> 02:40.160
AND EMILY WILL THANK YOU
HERSELF...

02:40.160 --> 02:42.493
IF YOU WOULD ONLY LET ME
TELL HER WHO I AM.

02:42.493 --> 02:43.594
IF SHE THOUGHT
FOR ONE MOMENT

02:43.594 --> 02:44.735
YOU WERE ANYTHING
OTHER THAN A NURSE,

02:44.735 --> 02:45.796
SHE WOULD REFUSE
YOUR HELP.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.168
SHE CAN BE STUBBORN.
I JUST NEED TO ASK

02:48.168 --> 02:50.271
ONE MORE THING OF YOU.
 NAME IT.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.943
SNEAK HER OUT.
MEET ME HERE TONIGHT.

02:52.943 --> 02:53.944
AIDEN, ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

02:53.944 --> 02:55.746
SHE'S STILL REALLY WEAK.

02:55.746 --> 02:56.747
I JUST WORRY THAT
THE LONGER SHE STAYS IN THERE,

02:56.747 --> 02:57.848
THE MORE AT RISK SHE IS.

02:57.848 --> 03:00.281
NOT IF I'M WATCHING
OVER HER.

03:00.281 --> 03:04.715
UNLESS YOU THINK
I'M THE RISK.

03:04.715 --> 03:07.558
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME, ISN'T THERE?

03:09.920 --> 03:12.263
WE RECONNECTED.

03:12.263 --> 03:15.195
AND BEFORE THIS
WENT WRONG,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.298
EMILY AND I
WERE GOING TO LEAVE...

03:17.298 --> 03:18.599
TOGETHER.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.232
RIGHT NOW I NEED
TO GET HER TO SAFETY

03:21.232 --> 03:23.574
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
GOES WRONG.

03:23.574 --> 03:25.736
SO I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS,

03:25.736 --> 03:27.738
BUT YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD HELP ME.

03:27.738 --> 03:28.939
YEAH, SEEMS SO.

03:28.939 --> 03:31.312
NIKO, PLEASE.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.683
BRING HER TO ME.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.945
OKAY? HEY.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.687
IT'S THE LAST THING
I'LL ASK.

03:36.687 --> 03:39.219
THANK YOU.

03:52.803 --> 03:54.234
HEY.

03:55.766 --> 03:59.940
I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR ACCIDENT.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.942
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
 YOU SHOULD BE
BY YOUR WIFE'S SIDE,

04:01.942 --> 04:04.545
NOT MINE. HOW WOULD IT LOOK
IF SOMEONE SAW YOU?

04:04.545 --> 04:05.816
I DON'T CARE.

04:05.816 --> 04:07.718
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS MAKING
THINGS RIGHT WITH YOU.

04:07.718 --> 04:09.019
THAT'S WHY I COVERED
YOUR HOSPITAL BILL--

04:09.019 --> 04:10.681
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY.
 (tray clatters)

04:10.681 --> 04:12.983
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

04:12.983 --> 04:15.456
WELL, I CAN'T,
NOT AFTER WHAT...

04:15.456 --> 04:18.257
NOT AFTER YOU HURT YOURSELF
LIKE YOU DID.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.862
YOU... YOU THINK
I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF...

04:21.862 --> 04:24.034
BECAUSE YOU MARRIED EMILY?

04:24.034 --> 04:26.266
THAT IS...
THAT IS SO TYPICAL GRAYSON,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.768
BELIEVING EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT YOU.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.300
YOUR ROOMMATE CALLED ME.
SHE--

04:29.300 --> 04:30.471
NO, I WAS DRUNK, DANNY.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.772
I PASSED OUT IN THE BATH
AND ALMOST DROWNED.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.475
I WAS STUPID, OKAY?
BUT I WON'T BE STUPID AGAIN.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.677
OH, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT--
 HEY!

04:36.677 --> 04:39.410
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, JACK.
 NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
YOU OKAY?

04:39.410 --> 04:41.352
SHE'S FINE.
 I WASN'T ASKING YOU.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.283
OH, YOU THINK YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.415
(loud smack)
 (Sara) AAH!

04:44.415 --> 04:46.317
YEAH, I DO.

04:46.317 --> 04:49.019
NOW PICK YOURSELF UP
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY BAR.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.362
(exhales)

04:54.365 --> 04:56.597
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:56.597 --> 04:59.600
(telephone ringing in distance)

05:08.078 --> 05:10.040
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE HER RESTING.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.082
SHE HAS ENDURED
SO MUCH PAIN.

05:12.082 --> 05:15.085
YES. WELL,
ALL PAIN IS RELATIVE.

05:15.085 --> 05:17.017
I HEAR HER AMNESIA'S
LIFTING.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.690
IT IS. ALTHOUGH EMILY STILL
CAN'T RECALL

05:19.690 --> 05:20.951
THE NIGHT OF THE TRAUMA.

05:20.951 --> 05:22.953
BUT GIVEN HER PROGRESS,

05:22.953 --> 05:24.925
I'D BE COMFORTABLE
DISCHARGING HER.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.928
WITH HER CONDITION, YOU CAN'T
JUST LET HER WALK OUT OF HERE.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.660
SHE STILL NEEDS AROUND-THE-CLOCK
MEDICAL ATTENTION,

05:29.660 --> 05:31.001
WHICH THE REHAB CLINIC
WOULD PROVIDE.

05:31.001 --> 05:33.464
I BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO
RECOVER COMPLETELY,

05:33.464 --> 05:36.066
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY.

05:36.066 --> 05:38.969
IT'S JUST A QUESTION
OF WHERE SHE DOES IT.

05:42.012 --> 05:43.414
EXCUSE ME.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.020
PERHAPS I CAN BE OF SERVICE,
MRS. GRAYSON.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.861
(Niko) SHE'S AWAKE.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.933
GOOD MORNING.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.468
(exhales deeply)

06:07.468 --> 06:09.700
(weakly) WHERE AM I?

06:09.700 --> 06:13.003
WELL, GRAYSON MANOR,
OF COURSE.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.506
WELCOME HOME.

06:30.521 --> 06:32.423
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
YOU'LL WANNA KEEP THOSE SHUT.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.094
THE PAPARAZZI HEARD THE NEWS
THAT YOU'RE HOME,

06:34.094 --> 06:36.066
AND THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING
TO STEAL YOUR SOUL...

06:36.066 --> 06:37.828
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN THAT SORT OF THING.

06:37.828 --> 06:40.571
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY...

06:40.571 --> 06:43.033
MY DOCTOR DISCHARGED ME?

06:43.033 --> 06:46.006
YES, STRAIGHT INTO MY CARE
AND YOUR NURSE'S.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.679
WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE
MORE COMFORTABLE HERE.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.410
YOU'RE A GRAYSON NOW.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.413
AND WE CIRCLE THE WAGONS
WHEN TRAGEDY STRIKES.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.945
(sighs)

06:54.945 --> 06:58.118
DR. STURMAN TOLD ME THAT
YOUR MEMORIES ARE RECOVERING.

06:58.118 --> 07:03.153
(sighs) THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER WAS...

07:03.153 --> 07:05.195
THE CHURCH,
THE WEDDING VOWS.

07:05.195 --> 07:08.128
AT LEAST...
I HAVE THAT HAPPY MOMENT.

07:08.128 --> 07:12.463
AND SPARED THE TRAUMATIC DETAILS
OF YOUR SHOOTING.

07:14.565 --> 07:17.708
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER,
BUT...

07:21.472 --> 07:22.813
DANIEL.

07:24.475 --> 07:27.718
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

07:27.718 --> 07:29.820
NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING,

07:29.820 --> 07:31.752
NOT COMPARED
TO YOUR INJURIES.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.854
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BEEN RELEASED.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.226
I BROUGHT EMILY HOME FOR
THE REMAINDER OF HER RECOVERY.

07:36.226 --> 07:39.129
ACTUALLY, VICTORIA, I THINK
I'D PREFER TO RECUPERATE

07:39.129 --> 07:41.161
IN THE BEACH HOUSE
WITH MY HUSBAND.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.695
NONSENSE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THAT LYDIA'S STILL ON THE LOOSE.

07:44.695 --> 07:47.998
I WOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF
SHE FINISHED WHAT SHE STARTED.

07:47.998 --> 07:53.103
WELL, I'LL LEAVE
YOU BOTH ALONE FOR A MOMENT.

07:59.109 --> 08:00.981
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.113
SHOULD PROBABLY
GET SOME REST.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.895
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.627
CONTAINING THE SITUATION.

08:16.627 --> 08:19.169
SHE'S ON THE VERGE
OF REMEMBERING WHAT YOU DID,

08:19.169 --> 08:20.701
AND WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO HAVE
SOME RANDOM ORDERLY

08:20.701 --> 08:22.002
AT THE HOSPITAL OVERHEAR IT.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.203
SO WE'RE HOLDING HER CAPTIVE.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.135
WE'RE KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
TO AVOID SUSPICION.

08:25.135 --> 08:28.779
FOR NOW, YOU ARE TWO NEWLYWEDS
BLISSFULLY IN LOVE.

08:28.779 --> 08:31.241
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SHE
REMEMBERS THAT'S NOT THE CASE?

08:31.241 --> 08:33.143
LET ME TAKE CARE OF IT.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.015
IN THE MEANWHILE,

08:35.015 --> 08:37.788
TRY TO KEEP YOUR VIOLENT
CONFRONTATIONS TO A MINIMUM.

08:37.788 --> 08:39.049
ALL RIGHT?

08:41.892 --> 08:45.756
(breathing heavily and grunting)

08:48.959 --> 08:50.561
(panting)

08:50.561 --> 08:51.662
TAKE MY HAND.

08:51.662 --> 08:53.203
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

08:53.203 --> 08:54.234
I THINK YOU DO.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.636
(panting)

08:55.636 --> 08:58.168
YOU'RE LUCKY SHE EVEN
LET ME COME HERE.

08:58.168 --> 08:59.840
(moans and exhales deeply)

08:59.840 --> 09:02.012
YOU DON'T WORK FOR THEM?

09:02.012 --> 09:03.844
OH, I TOOK HER MONEY.
 (static crackling)

09:03.844 --> 09:04.975
BUT NO.

09:04.975 --> 09:06.276
(crackling stops, click)
 OKAY. ROOM'S CLEAR.

09:06.276 --> 09:07.648
WE CAN TALK.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.179
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

09:09.179 --> 09:12.252
JUST MYSELF...

09:12.252 --> 09:15.586
AND THE MEMORY
OF MY FATHER.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.290
YOU'RE TAKEDA'S DAUGHTER.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.162
NIKO.

09:23.634 --> 09:24.895
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET

09:24.895 --> 09:26.967
THE ONLY STUDENT HE EVER
SPOKE OF WITH AFFECTION.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.169
AND MINE
TO MEET HIS ONLY CHILD.

09:30.901 --> 09:32.572
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.006
TOOK SOME TIME TO ACCEPT IT--

09:36.006 --> 09:38.909
HOW SUCH A GREAT WARRIOR
WAS KILLED BY A RANDOM BURGLAR.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.180
WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SETBACK,

09:40.180 --> 09:43.583
I THOUGHT I COULD HELP YOU
OVERCOME IT.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.985
IT'S WHAT HE WOULD'VE
WANTED.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.316
THANK YOU.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.162
BUT MY MISSION'S OVER.

09:52.162 --> 09:54.164
I'M LEAVING AS SOON
AS I CAN WALK OUT OF HERE.

09:54.164 --> 09:55.926
AIDEN SAID
YOU WERE STUBBORN.

09:55.926 --> 09:58.298
(inhales and exhales deeply)
YOU KNOW AIDEN?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.771
WE MET WHEN HE WAS
ON A MISSION IN SYDNEY,

10:00.771 --> 10:02.232
WHERE MY MUM RAISED ME.

10:02.232 --> 10:05.736
THEN WE RECONNECTED LAST YEAR
AFTER MY FATHER'S DEATH.

10:05.736 --> 10:07.377
DOES HE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

10:07.377 --> 10:10.040
I'VE BEEN REPORTING
YOUR PROGRESS TO HIM EVERY DAY.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.842
THEN PLEASE TAKE ME TO HIM.

10:11.842 --> 10:14.284
I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT BEING HERE.

10:14.284 --> 10:17.087
MAYBE IT'S SAFEST
IN THE EYE OF THE STORM.

10:19.189 --> 10:21.151
(indistinct conversations)

10:21.151 --> 10:22.152
DANIEL?

10:22.152 --> 10:24.755
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN.

10:24.755 --> 10:26.196
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:26.196 --> 10:28.158
WELL, I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

10:28.158 --> 10:29.860
HOW'S EMILY?

10:29.860 --> 10:31.662
SHE'S BEEN DISCHARGED.

10:31.662 --> 10:32.663
♪♪♪

10:32.663 --> 10:35.666
SHOULDN'T YOU BE HOME
WITH HER THEN?

10:35.666 --> 10:37.137
WORK WILL BE HERE
WHEN YOU RETURN.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.269
NOT IF WE DON'T GET
THIS ISSUE OUT.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.171
I'M LOOKING
AT WHAT YOU HAVE.

10:41.171 --> 10:43.213
AND?
 THE BONES ARE HERE,

10:43.213 --> 10:46.016
BUT... I THINK
YOU SHOULD DIG DEEPER.

10:46.016 --> 10:47.647
♪♪♪

10:47.647 --> 10:49.049
I HANDLED THE SUBJECT
WITH INTEGRITY.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.650
WELL, INTEGRITY
DOESN'T SELL MAGAZINES.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.054
THE STORY IS LYDIA DAVIS'
VENGEFUL RETURN TO THE HAMPTONS

10:54.054 --> 10:56.186
TO COMMIT MURDER.
YOU SHIED AWAY FROM THAT.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.287
BECAUSE THAT'S STILL
SPECULATION.

10:57.287 --> 10:59.089
SHE HASN'T BEEN CONVICTED.
 NO, ONCE SHE IS,

10:59.089 --> 11:01.892
YOU'LL KICK YOURSELF
FOR HAVING HESITATED.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.093
♪♪♪

11:03.093 --> 11:05.095
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS,
MARGO,

11:05.095 --> 11:08.238

SCOOPS OUR STORY.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.845
(inhales and exhales deeply)

11:17.778 --> 11:19.109

11:19.109 --> 11:21.782
HOW IS OUR PATIENT
GETTING ALONG?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.914
IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND.

11:26.316 --> 11:27.858
WOULD YOU GIVE US
A MOMENT?

11:27.858 --> 11:28.919
MM-HMM.

11:28.919 --> 11:30.090
(gloves snap)

11:35.465 --> 11:38.128
NOT SO LONG AGO,
I WAS...

11:38.128 --> 11:40.971
THE ONE VISITING YOU
AT YOUR BEDSIDE. (clears throat)

11:40.971 --> 11:44.374
(chuckles)
AND YOU WERE MY SAVIOR.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.977
AND I'M HERE IN HOPES
THAT I CAN BE YOURS.

11:46.977 --> 11:50.340
IT MUST BE MADDENING
NOT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER

11:50.340 --> 11:53.183
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
ON THE BOAT.

11:53.183 --> 11:56.987
CLEARLY SOMEONE
MEANT YOU HARM.

11:56.987 --> 11:59.349
LYDIA, SO I WAS TOLD.

11:59.349 --> 12:01.752
OH.

12:01.752 --> 12:04.154
OR DO YOU NOT BELIEVE
IT WAS HER?

12:04.154 --> 12:06.726
WELL,
I WILL ONCE YOU TELL ME TO.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.359
IF SHE DID DO IT, CONRAD,
WHY?

12:09.359 --> 12:12.302
YOU KNOW HER BETTER
THAN ANYONE.

12:12.302 --> 12:15.135
MM-HMM.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.137
YOUR MEMORIES WILL RETURN,
EMILY,

12:17.137 --> 12:20.070

I SUGGEST YOU COME TO ME FIRST.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.844

TWO BULLETS TO THE STOMACH.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.976

12:35.255 --> 12:36.486
PATRICK...

12:36.486 --> 12:41.331
I NEED ANY DETAILS
YOU CAN GIVE ME ABOUT THAT BOX

12:41.331 --> 12:42.833
NOLAN HAS HIDDEN
IN HIS HOUSE.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.764
I'M HIRING SOMEONE
TO GO IN THERE AND GET IT.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.266
I CAN DO IT.

12:47.537 --> 12:49.239
OR DO YOU NOT TRUST ME?

12:49.239 --> 12:51.501
OF COURSE I DO.
YOU KNOW THAT.

12:51.501 --> 12:54.074
BUT I NEED A PROFESSIONAL
TO DO THIS

12:54.074 --> 12:56.076
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.108
EMILY'S RECOVERING
IN MY HOUSE,

12:58.108 --> 13:00.110

OF LEVERAGE

I CAN GET AGAINST HER
BEFORE SHE RECOVERS HER MEMORY.

13:03.113 --> 13:06.256
MEMORY OF WHAT? YOU...
YOU DIDN'T SHOOT HER.

13:06.256 --> 13:10.861
NO, I DIDN'T.

13:10.861 --> 13:12.792
DANIEL DID.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.065
YOU TOLD ME THAT LYDIA DID.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.099
YOU LIED TO ME.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.370
IT WAS ONLY TO PROTECT HIM.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.272
AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED
TO HIRE SOMEONE, RIGHT?

13:22.272 --> 13:23.473
TO KEEP ME FROM THE TRUTH.
 PATRICK--

13:23.473 --> 13:24.975
I CAME CLEAN TO YOU
ABOUT NOLAN.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.477
DIDN'T I? NO, I ACTUALLY--
I GAVE NOLAN UP FOR YOU.

13:27.477 --> 13:29.009
AND AFTER ALL THESE MONTHS,

13:29.009 --> 13:30.280
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU,

13:30.280 --> 13:31.511
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE DONE,

13:31.511 --> 13:33.143
I WILL NEVER, EVER
GAIN YOUR CONFIDENCE, WILL I?

13:33.143 --> 13:35.085
IT IS NOT THAT, PATRICK.
 IF IT'S NOT THAT,
THEN WHAT IS IT?!

13:35.085 --> 13:36.386
YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

13:36.386 --> 13:37.817
WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS,

13:37.817 --> 13:39.319
BUT I GUESS WHEN IT COMES
TO CHOOSING SONS,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.521
NO, NO, YOU CHOOSE YOUR BLOOD
OVER YOUR BASTARD.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.824
(loud slap)
 DON'T YOU EVER
SAY THAT AGAIN!

13:44.824 --> 13:45.996
(gasping)

13:45.996 --> 13:48.258
YOU ARE MY BLOOD.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.260
YOU'RE THE ONLY PURE THING
I HAVE,

13:50.260 --> 13:52.262
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE SAME DARKNESS

13:52.262 --> 13:54.604
THAT HAS FOLLOWED ME AROUND
MY ENTIRE LIFE,

13:54.604 --> 13:56.266
AND IT'S INFECTED
THIS FAMILY,

13:56.266 --> 13:59.139
AND I WILL NOT ALLOW IT
TO CORRUPT YOU AS WELL.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.911
THAT'S WHY IT'S MY DUTY,
NOT YOURS,

14:00.911 --> 14:03.543
TO EXPOSE EMILY THORNE.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.516
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

14:06.516 --> 14:09.149
LOUD AND CLEAR, YEAH.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.321
ALL RIGHT.

14:31.541 --> 14:34.044
DON'T WORRY.
I COME IN PEACE. I PROMISE.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.476
SORRY, WATER IN MY EAR.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.509
DID YOU SAY, "IN PEACE"
OR "IN COMPLETE SHAME

14:39.509 --> 14:42.652
AFTER HAVING BEEN YANKED AROUND
BY YOUR UMBILICAL CORD"?

14:42.652 --> 14:44.614
GUESS I DESERVE THAT.

14:44.614 --> 14:46.486
EITHER WAY, SAVE IT.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.618
I'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR EPISODES
OF "PATRICK SAYS 'I'M SORRY'"

14:48.618 --> 14:50.320
ON MY DVR.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.461
WELL, DO YOU HAVE THE ONE
WHERE HE TELLS YOU

14:51.461 --> 14:53.493
THAT HE FIGURED OUT
HIS MOM'S A BITCH?

14:53.493 --> 14:55.325
IT TOOK ME LONGER
THAN IT SHOULD HAVE

14:55.325 --> 14:57.097
TO SEE HER TRUE COLORS.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.269
SHE ACTUALLY SLAPPED ME.

14:59.269 --> 15:01.331
YOU DIDN'T ENJOY IT?

15:02.572 --> 15:07.107
ALL I EVER WANTED FROM HER
WAS AN HONEST RELATIONSHIP,

15:07.107 --> 15:11.041
FIND OUT WHO I AM,
MORE ABOUT WHERE I CAME FROM.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.412
THE WHOLE TIME...

15:12.412 --> 15:15.515
SHOULD'VE BEEN FOCUSED MORE
ON... WHERE I WANTED TO GO.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.387
WHERE'S THAT?

15:17.387 --> 15:20.420
ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.993
ALL I'M ASKING IS
FOR A PEACEFUL EVENING

15:22.993 --> 15:24.494
WHERE WE CAN AVOID
TALKING ABOUT ANYONE

15:24.494 --> 15:27.157
WITHIN A 20-MILE RADIUS,
OKAY?

15:27.157 --> 15:29.259
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
MEET ME AT YOUR PLACE AT 7:00?

15:35.505 --> 15:37.507
MAKE IT 8:00.

15:37.507 --> 15:41.641
THAT WAY, IT'LL GIVE ME
AN EXTRA HOUR TO REALIZE

15:41.641 --> 15:43.343
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.552
(Charlotte) I HOP YOU SAVED
SOME ENERGY FOR A VISITOR.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.625
(whispers) HI.
 AND SINCE MY MOTHER

15:55.625 --> 15:57.687
PUT A MORATORIUM
ON GUESTS,

15:57.687 --> 15:59.489
I'LL STAND GUARD
WHILE YOU TWO CATCH UP.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.391
THANK YOU.
 (Jack) THANKS.

16:01.391 --> 16:02.562
HE'S GETTING SO BIG.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.094
(sighs) YEAH.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.396
HE'S STARTING TO WALK NOW,
TOO, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.298
WELL,
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.640
OH. LET ME SEE HIM.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.543
WHEN CHARLOTTE FOUND OUT
THAT I BROUGHT CARL BACK,

16:13.543 --> 16:16.546
SHE ASKED US TO COME BY.

16:16.546 --> 16:19.549
AND BESIDES,

16:19.549 --> 16:21.511
NOLAN AND I WERE WORRIED
WHEN THEY MOVED YOU HERE.

16:21.511 --> 16:23.313
THIS IS MY ONLY SHOT
OF SEEING YOU.

16:23.313 --> 16:24.714
I'M SURE DANIEL TOLD YOU
I DECKED HIM.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.356
WHAT?

16:26.356 --> 16:28.388
IT'S STUPID. I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT HE CAME INTO THE STOWAWAY,

16:28.388 --> 16:30.990
AND I JUST--JUST SEEING HIM
WALKING AROUND FREE

16:30.990 --> 16:32.362
AFTER WHAT HE DID?

16:32.362 --> 16:34.524
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TURN HIM IN?

16:34.524 --> 16:37.467
(sighs) IF I ACCUSE HIM,
THEY'LL FIGHT BACK.

16:37.467 --> 16:40.400
I NEED TO LAY LOW
UNTIL I CAN ESCAPE SAFELY.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.601
YOU GOTTA LET IT GO.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.503
I DID.

16:43.503 --> 16:48.508
IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE
AT A... (sighs) NORMAL LIFE.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.282
MAYBE WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
I'LL...

16:52.282 --> 16:55.115
I'LL HAVE A FAMILY OF MY OWN.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.688
LISTEN, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
GET A MESSAGE TO AIDEN.

16:58.688 --> 17:00.320
I AM SO SORRY TO DO THIS,

17:00.320 --> 17:03.153
BUT BIANCA JUST SAID MY MOTHER'S
ON HER WAY HOME,

17:03.153 --> 17:05.224
AND SINCE IT'S ME
SHE'LL BLAME...

17:05.224 --> 17:08.228
OH, THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THE RISK. (clears throat)

17:08.228 --> 17:10.630
DON'T GROW UP TOO FAST, BUDDY.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.262
(babbles)
 YEAH.

17:12.262 --> 17:14.564
(chuckles) COME ON.
 OKAY.

17:14.564 --> 17:18.308
HERE WE GO.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.270
OH, JACK.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.771
CARL DROPPED HIS PUPPY.

17:21.771 --> 17:25.545
OH.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.519
(sighs) THINK HE WANTS EMILY
TO HAVE IT...

17:29.519 --> 17:33.553
TO KEEP YOU COMPANY.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.426
THANK YOU.

17:45.535 --> 17:47.397
HELLO?
 (turns lock)

17:47.397 --> 17:48.568
(Victoria) Patrick?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.501
IF YOU'VE HIRED SOMEONE,
YOU CAN FIRE HIM.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.643
I'M ON MY WAY TO NOLAN'S
RIGHT NOW.

17:53.643 --> 17:54.704
No.

17:54.704 --> 17:56.546
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO DO IT.

17:56.546 --> 18:00.610
YEAH, WELL... IT'S TOO LATE.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.652
JUST PROMISE YOU'LL STAND BY ME
WHEN IT'S ALL DONE.

18:02.652 --> 18:03.713
OF COURSE I WILL.

18:03.713 --> 18:07.086
BUT, PATRICK, BE SAFE.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.588
HE'S PART OF A SICK GAME,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.660
AND WHATEVER EMILY HAS
HIDDEN IN THAT BOX,

18:10.660 --> 18:13.393
HE IS NOT GOING TO LET IT GO
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.729
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU HEAR?

18:19.729 --> 18:22.832
SOMETHING ABOUT A BOX
PATRICK'S SUPPOSED TO RETRIEVE--

18:22.832 --> 18:27.106
SECRETS VICTORIA THINKS
YOU'RE KEEPING.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.778
MY INFINITY BOX.

18:28.778 --> 18:33.813
EVERYTHING'S IN THERE--
MY... FATHER'S JOURNALS,

18:33.813 --> 18:36.886
EVIDENCE OF MY TAKEDOWNS,
MY IDENTITY.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.618
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.620
WE NEED TO STOP HIM.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.192
(sighs)

18:42.192 --> 18:44.394
(breathes heavily)

18:47.357 --> 18:49.529
NO.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.631
NO, LET HER FIND IT.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.463
IT'S OVER ANYWAY.

18:53.463 --> 18:55.235
SO YOU'RE GIVING UP.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.236
THIS IS THE END
OF YOUR GREAT MISSION--

18:56.236 --> 18:57.237
EVERYTHING YOU FOUGHT FOR.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.638
I'VE ALREADY
LOST THE FIGHT.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.410
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.542
I SHOULD BE AWAY WITH AIDEN,
WITH HIS RING ON MY FINGER,

19:02.542 --> 19:03.773
NOT DANIEL'S.

19:03.773 --> 19:04.874
(sighs)

19:04.874 --> 19:07.817
YOU AND AIDEN ARE ENGAGED?

19:07.817 --> 19:10.320
HE PROPOSED TO ME
BEFORE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.358
(sighs)

19:18.358 --> 19:19.689
LOOK...

19:19.689 --> 19:21.831
I KNOW THAT YOU CAME BACK
TO HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS,

19:21.831 --> 19:23.533
BUT I AM DONE.

19:25.595 --> 19:29.569
UHH! (gasping)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.871
THAT PAIN YOU'RE FEELING--

19:31.871 --> 19:33.803
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

19:33.803 --> 19:35.705
THEY DID THAT TO YOU,

19:35.705 --> 19:37.607
AND YOU'RE LETTING THEM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

19:37.607 --> 19:40.950
THAT WOMAN I LISTENED
TO MY FATHER GO ON ABOUT,

19:40.950 --> 19:43.253
THE ONE WHO STOLE
ALL HIS ATTENTION

19:43.253 --> 19:45.315
AND THE AFFECTION
I WISHED I HAD--

19:45.315 --> 19:47.186
THIS IS HOW SHE ENDS UP?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.919
I'M GLAD HE'S NOT AROUND
TO SEE IT.

19:49.919 --> 19:51.521
(grunts)

19:51.521 --> 19:54.764
YOUR FATHER TAUGHT YOU WELL.

19:54.764 --> 19:57.267
BUT NOTHING YOU SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE MY MIND.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.529
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.331
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:01.331 --> 20:03.703
I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND
TO HELP YOU.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.906
(exhales deeply)

20:06.906 --> 20:09.809
(breathing deeply)

20:15.515 --> 20:18.648
OH, WHERE DID YOUR NURSE
RUN OFF TO?

20:18.648 --> 20:20.720
I GAVE HER THE NIGHT OFF.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.994
OH. WELL, I COULDN'T HAVE YOU
GO TO BED WITHOUT DESSERT.

20:24.994 --> 20:28.798
MARTHA MADE
THE MOST DELICATE PROFITEROLES.

20:28.798 --> 20:30.360
NO, THANK YOU.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.665
I'M SORRY
TO BRING THIS UP, BUT...

20:35.665 --> 20:37.767
WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND DANIEL

20:37.767 --> 20:40.570
AND THE PREGNANCY,
OR LACK THEREOF,

20:40.570 --> 20:43.843
IS A PRIVATE MATTER
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

20:43.843 --> 20:48.017
HOWEVER...

20:48.017 --> 20:49.719
WHILE YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS
IN THE HOSPITAL,

20:49.719 --> 20:52.822
THE DOCTORS CAME TO DANIEL
WITH THESE TEST RESULTS.

20:52.822 --> 20:54.354
WHEN YOU CAME TO,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.826
WE FEARED THAT YOU WEREN'T
STABLE ENOUGH TO FACE THEM,

20:56.826 --> 20:59.258
SO I VOLUNTEERED TO DELIVER
THE NEWS TO YOU

20:59.258 --> 21:01.661
WHEN YOU WERE READY.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.964
BUT NOW I'M NOT SURE
IF I'M ABLE TO DO IT.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.367
WHAT IS IT?

21:14.404 --> 21:17.947
BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION
OF THE BULLET WOUNDS,

21:17.947 --> 21:20.580
AND THE SURGERIES REQUIRED
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.812
THE DOCTORS HAD NO CHOICE.

21:22.812 --> 21:25.054
A SACRIFICE HAD TO BE MADE.

21:25.054 --> 21:28.318
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE, EMILY.

21:31.861 --> 21:33.292
YOU'RE LYING.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.864
NO.

21:36.466 --> 21:38.297
FEEL FREE TO CONFIRM
WITH DR. STURMAN

21:38.297 --> 21:40.870
OR SEEK A SECOND OPINION.

21:40.870 --> 21:44.904
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
IT'S BEEN SO TRAGIC FOR DANIEL

21:44.904 --> 21:46.936
AND WHY HE'S BEEN SO DISTANT.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.939
FOR YOU TO HAVE GIVEN HIM
HOPE FOR AN HEIR,

21:49.939 --> 21:52.782
ONLY TO HAVE IT TAKEN AWAY
FROM HIM FOREVER...

21:52.782 --> 21:55.014
(whispers) GET OUT.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.616
(exhales)

21:56.616 --> 22:01.891
FATE CAN BE SO CRUEL.
HMM.

22:05.855 --> 22:06.956
(door closes)

22:09.028 --> 22:12.001
(breathing heavily)

22:12.001 --> 22:15.565

22:15.565 --> 22:19.108
(gasping)

22:25.675 --> 22:27.677
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE'S GONNA STAY?

22:27.677 --> 22:30.980
I GUESS BEING THERE IN THAT
HOUSE FORCED HER TO REFOCUS.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.452
AND HOW DID SHE END UP IN
THAT HOUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

22:32.452 --> 22:33.683
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BRING HER TO ME.

22:33.683 --> 22:34.684
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

22:34.684 --> 22:35.855
THE GRAYSONS MADE
A SNAP DECISION

22:35.855 --> 22:37.026
AND HAD HER DISCHARGED.

22:37.026 --> 22:39.389
LOOK,
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL

22:39.389 --> 22:42.361
THAT I MANIPULATED MY WAY
IN THERE TO PROTECT HER.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.394
YOU KNOW I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

22:44.394 --> 22:47.667
NOT THAT YOU DESERVE MY LOYALTY
AFTER YOU LIED TO ME.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.399
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:49.399 --> 22:51.601
WELL, YOU FORGOT TO MENTION
YOU WERE ENGAGED.

22:51.601 --> 22:54.003
AND EMILY OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT US--

22:54.003 --> 22:55.975
OUR PAST,
HOW YOU LEFT ME IN JAPAN

22:55.975 --> 22:57.477
WITH A PROMISE TO RETURN.

22:58.948 --> 23:00.850
DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

23:00.850 --> 23:02.982
WOULD'VE BEEN EASY TO.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.885
BUT I WOULDN'T HURT YOU
LIKE THAT.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.458
PLEASE, WILL YOU...

23:08.458 --> 23:10.890
WILL YOU GIVE HER
A MESSAGE FOR ME?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.962
OF COURSE.

23:12.962 --> 23:15.595
JUST TELL HER NOT TO DO
ANYTHING RASH

23:15.595 --> 23:16.996
UNTIL I CAN GET TO HER.

23:16.996 --> 23:20.770
IT JUST... DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE SHE'S THINKING CLEARLY.

23:20.770 --> 23:23.533
OR MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HER
AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.009
(chuckles)

23:30.009 --> 23:31.481
MMM.

23:31.481 --> 23:33.983
YOU KNOW, THIS--
THIS IS MY HOUSE, RIGHT?

23:33.983 --> 23:35.915
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT BEATING LAST CALL.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.146
OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE STILL

23:37.146 --> 23:39.549

SKIPPED OVER ALL THE HARD PARTS

26:17.176 --> 26:19.849
IS THE TRUTH

THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
EITHER.

YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
FOR THE BEST, DANIEL.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.883
EMILY LIED
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY.

27:33.883 --> 27:36.355

TO SCARE YOU AWAY.

27:36.355 --> 27:40.329

27:40.329 --> 27:41.831
THE ONLY WAY
SHE COULD KEEP US APART

27:41.831 --> 27:43.793
WAS TO TRAP ME.

SHE KNEW I WOULDN'T
WALK AWAY FROM MY CHILD.

 SHE ADMITTED EVERYTHING
AFTER THE WEDDING.

27:58.007 --> 27:59.749
THEN--THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL WITH HER?

27:59.749 --> 28:01.811
IF I KICKED HER TO THE CURB,
SHE'LL--SHE'LL MAKE IT LOOK

28:01.811 --> 28:04.313
AS THOUGH I'M ABANDONING HER,
OR--OR WORSE,

28:04.313 --> 28:06.185
SHE'LL MAKE PEOPLE WONDER

28:16.695 --> 28:17.967

28:17.967 --> 28:19.468

28:19.468 --> 28:21.370

28:56.465 --> 28:58.938
IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
FILLING IN THE HOLES

28:58.938 --> 29:01.971

DUE TO YOUR SO-CALLED AMNESIA,

29:01.971 --> 29:04.413
PERHAPS I CAN ASSIST.

29:04.413 --> 29:08.417

A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

SET YOUR SIGHTS ON HIM.

29:19.458 --> 29:23.893

OUR HABITS.

29:25.394 --> 29:28.037
BANK STATEMENTS, PROVING
THAT YOU'RE NOT AS WEALTHY

29:28.037 --> 29:30.299
AS YOU PRETENDED TO BE.

29:30.299 --> 29:32.471
IT'S QUITE
A GRIFTER'S TREASURE TROVE.

CONGRATULATIONS, VICTORIA.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.776

29:37.776 --> 29:40.079
YOUR INSTINCTS WERE RIGHT
ALL ALONG.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.450
BUT WHILE I CAME HERE
FOR STATUS,

29:41.450 --> 29:44.353
THAT'S NOT WHY I STAYED.

29:44.353 --> 29:45.915
I TRULY LOVED DANIEL.

29:45.915 --> 29:49.859
(sighs) NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
WILL SAVE YOU NOW.

29:49.859 --> 29:51.290
BUT WHAT IS A FITTING END
TO SOMEONE

29:51.290 --> 29:53.062
WHO'S CONNED HER WAY
INTO SOCIETY

29:53.062 --> 29:55.024
AND OUR FAMILY'S LIVES?

29:55.024 --> 29:58.828

30:04.073 --> 30:05.534

CALL THEIR LISTS,

BECAUSE ONCE WORD IS OUT
THAT YOU'RE A FRAUD,

30:09.138 --> 30:11.480

30:11.480 --> 30:14.513
THE BREAD AND BUTTER

30:14.513 --> 30:17.186

GAVE ME PERMISSION

31:29.288 --> 31:32.561

WHY?

31:32.561 --> 31:35.164
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY, JACK?

31:35.164 --> 31:36.265
I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU
FROM PRINTING SOMETHING

31:36.265 --> 31:37.666
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

31:37.666 --> 31:40.069

THAT HE USED HIS OWN MAGAZINE

31:40.069 --> 31:42.231
TO COVER THIS UP,
YOUR CAREER IS OVER.

31:46.675 --> 31:50.079
IT WASN'T LYDIA WHO SHOT EMILY.
IT WAS DANIEL.

31:50.079 --> 31:53.242
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

31:53.242 --> 31:56.245

32:46.435 --> 32:48.737
SINCE MY IN-LAWS
BROUGHT ME HOME,

32:48.737 --> 32:54.443
I HAVE ENDURED... MORE PAIN
THAN I THOUGHT HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

32:54.443 --> 32:56.545
BUT I BELIEVE
BECAUSE OF THIS JOURNEY...

32:56.545 --> 32:58.377
(camera shutters
continue clicking)

32:58.377 --> 33:00.279
MY MEMORY HAS RETURNED.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.980
(reporters murmuring)

33:01.980 --> 33:05.084
THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION
AS TO WHO SHOT ME,

33:05.084 --> 33:07.516
AND I WANNA SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

33:09.758 --> 33:12.421
IT WAS LYDIA DAVIS.

33:12.421 --> 33:13.762
(reporters murmuring)

33:13.762 --> 33:15.564
AND MY HUSBAND AND I

33:15.564 --> 33:17.696
ARE OFFERING
A $10 MILLION REWARD

33:17.696 --> 33:19.598
FOR HER CAPTURE.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.700
THANK YOU.

33:21.700 --> 33:25.434
(reporters) MRS. GRAYSON!
MRS. GRAYSON! MRS. GRAYSON!

33:32.681 --> 33:35.084
(sighs)

33:41.350 --> 33:42.651
(sighs)

33:48.397 --> 33:50.299
DID YOU SEE THE NEWS YET?

33:50.299 --> 33:52.801
(door closes)
 (Nolan) Saw it?

33:52.801 --> 33:54.733
I laughed. I cried.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.466
(chuckles)
It's better than "Cats."

33:57.466 --> 34:00.369
(Velcro rips)

34:00.369 --> 34:02.371
(sighs)

34:02.371 --> 34:03.742
ONCE AGAIN, I OWE YOU.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.475
WE'LL ADD IT TO YOUR TAB.

34:06.475 --> 34:09.378
(object clatters)

34:09.378 --> 34:11.719
I'M JUST GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO STICK AROUND.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.322
Well, I wouldn't have been
able to

34:13.322 --> 34:14.483
IF YOU HADN'T SWITCHED OUT
THE INFINITY BOX

34:14.483 --> 34:15.684
AT THE LAST SECOND.

34:15.684 --> 34:18.357
Victoria bought
every detail.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.389
I JUST HOPE YOU GOT AWAY
UNSCATHED.

34:20.389 --> 34:22.231
Almost.

34:22.231 --> 34:24.493
PATRICK WON'T BE SO LUCKY.

34:24.493 --> 34:28.437
HE WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT HIS MOTHER?

34:32.771 --> 34:36.245
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I PLAN ON
GIVING HIM.

34:36.245 --> 34:38.347
(knock on door)

34:38.347 --> 34:40.248
(lowered voice) I GOTTA GO.
 (click)

34:42.610 --> 34:44.183
COME IN.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.554
(clears throat)

34:45.554 --> 34:49.288
BIANCA. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.

34:52.261 --> 34:55.393
(exhales) THANKS.

34:55.393 --> 34:59.168
UM... MRS. GRAYSON ORDERED ME
NOT TO LEAVE YOUR SIDE...

34:59.168 --> 35:00.369
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

35:00.369 --> 35:02.571
WELL, MOST OF MY THINGS
ARE IN MY BEDROOM.

35:02.571 --> 35:04.203
I MEAN, YOU COULD HELP ME
UP THE STAIRS,

35:04.203 --> 35:06.835
OR I COULD JUST SCREAM
IF I'M IN DANGER.

35:06.835 --> 35:09.878
(exhales) ALL RIGHT.
WAIT HERE.

35:09.878 --> 35:12.281
THANKS.

35:19.488 --> 35:22.491
(waves crashing)

35:27.396 --> 35:31.730
I SEE YOU'VE FOUND
YOUR STRENGTH.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.731
(lowered voice)
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.234
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.635
(kisses)

35:42.311 --> 35:45.344
YOU SAW MY ANNOUNCEMENT?

35:46.475 --> 35:49.378
YEAH. I DID.

35:49.378 --> 35:51.250
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.821
I HAD TO ACCUSE LYDIA

35:52.821 --> 35:55.624
TO SALVAGE MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEM.

35:55.624 --> 35:58.587
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN?
YOU'RE STAYING.

35:58.587 --> 36:02.731
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

36:02.731 --> 36:04.433
THEY DID.

36:07.736 --> 36:11.700
I FOUND OUT
I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

36:14.573 --> 36:18.307
THEY TOOK MY FATHER,
MY MOTHER...

36:20.279 --> 36:21.910
MY BEST FRIEND...

36:23.752 --> 36:25.254
AND NOW THIS?

36:25.254 --> 36:26.515
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY

36:26.515 --> 36:27.956
YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE
ANY MORE OF YOUR LIFE

36:27.956 --> 36:30.319
ON THESE PEOPLE.
WE CAN STILL MOVE ON.

36:30.319 --> 36:31.590
WE CAN BUILD A FUTURE
TOGETHER.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.363
THIS IS MY FUTURE, AIDEN.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.966
I KNOW I PROMISED YOU
A DIFFERENT ONE, BUT...

36:40.869 --> 36:42.301
I WAS WRONG TO.

36:44.373 --> 36:46.204
YOU'RE ENDING THIS
WITH ME?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.707
YOU'RE GONNA LET THEM TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM YOU, TOO, EMILY?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.309
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.412
I HAVE.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.651
HATE IS A LOT LIKE LOVE.

37:02.651 --> 37:05.854
YOU CAN'T FORCE IT.

37:05.854 --> 37:07.596
YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.931
YOU JUST HAVE TO EMBRACE IT
WHEN IT COMES ALONG.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.232
I'M SORRY.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.606
I CAN HANDLE IT.

37:17.606 --> 37:19.908
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF.

37:19.908 --> 37:22.240
SEEMS THAT'S WHAT'S
YOU'RE BEST AT ANYWAY.

37:26.875 --> 37:29.318
(inhales and exhales deeply)

37:38.327 --> 37:39.828
(Jack) YOU GOTTA EAT SOME.
YOU GOTTA EAT SOME.

37:39.828 --> 37:42.931
I CAN'T EAT 'EM ALL.

37:42.931 --> 37:46.465
YOU WERE WRONG.
IT WAS LYDIA.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.937
WHAT?

37:48.937 --> 37:51.500
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I MISSED THE DEADLINE,

37:51.500 --> 37:52.941
COSTING US MONEY
WE DON'T HAVE.

37:52.941 --> 37:55.944
EVEN WORSE,
YOU MADE ME DOUBT MYSELF.

37:55.944 --> 37:57.506
EMILY TOLD ME
DANIEL SHOT HER.

37:57.506 --> 38:00.409
WELL, THEN WHY IS SHE
TELLING THE WORLD OTHERWISE?

38:00.409 --> 38:01.780
(buttons click)

38:01.780 --> 38:06.315
ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN
 SPECULATING WHO SHOT ME.

38:08.317 --> 38:11.520
I'D LIKE TO SET
 THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.392
IT WAS LYDIA DAVIS.

38:13.392 --> 38:16.425
AND MY HUSBAND AND I
 ARE OFFERING

38:16.425 --> 38:19.528
A $10 MILLION REWARD
 FOR HER CAPTURE.

38:19.528 --> 38:23.432
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

38:23.432 --> 38:24.773
LOOK, SHE SUFFERED
MAJOR HEAD TRAUMA.

38:24.773 --> 38:26.705
PERHAPS WHEN YOU SPOKE,
SHE WAS DELIRIOUS

38:26.705 --> 38:28.737
OR... CONFUSED.

38:28.737 --> 38:30.038
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED.

38:30.038 --> 38:33.011
(coos)

38:33.011 --> 38:35.043
I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE
AGAIN, OKAY?

38:39.688 --> 38:42.521
I KNOW YOU WERE ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.093
LET'S JUST HOPE THIS ISSUE
IS A HIT.

38:45.093 --> 38:48.657
MY ASSISTANT IS TAKING IT
TO PRINT AS WE SPEAK.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.037
I BELIEVE...

38:59.037 --> 39:02.340
THIS COVERS THE RISK
YOU'RE TAKING AND THEN SOME.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.642
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.073
I BOUGHT US FOUR HOURS.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.375
OH.

39:06.375 --> 39:10.919
NOW WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

39:12.881 --> 39:14.383
(knock on door)

39:17.426 --> 39:18.927
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:18.927 --> 39:20.429
YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:20.429 --> 39:23.392
EMILY'S STAYING
TO FINISH WHAT SHE STARTED.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.865
SEE? I TOLD YOU.

39:29.398 --> 39:31.570
I TRIED TO TALK HER
OUT OF IT.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.071
LIKE YOU SAID,
SHE'S STUBBORN.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.404
MY FATHER USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT HER.

39:35.404 --> 39:37.375
LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I STAYED HERE

39:37.375 --> 39:38.507
SINCE HE WAS MURDERED.

39:38.507 --> 39:41.480
THAT'S WHERE THE POLICE
FOUND HIS BODY.

39:43.011 --> 39:46.485
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT
DOESN'T ADD UP.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.687
(grunts)

39:48.687 --> 39:49.958
I DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.089
YAH!

39:51.089 --> 39:52.791
THEY NEVER HAD A SUSPECT.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.992
UHH!

39:53.992 --> 39:55.924
AND I ACCEPTED THAT.

39:55.924 --> 39:58.096
(clank)

40:00.168 --> 40:01.930
HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE
TRAINING PEOPLE

40:01.930 --> 40:03.972
TO EXACT REVENGE.

40:03.972 --> 40:06.735
BEING AROUND EMILY
MADE ME REALIZE

40:06.735 --> 40:08.977
IT'S MY DUTY
TO AVENGE HIM.

40:12.981 --> 40:16.114
WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY?

40:16.114 --> 40:20.188
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

40:20.188 --> 40:22.420
LET'S NOT
TALK AT ALL THEN.

40:37.165 --> 40:40.709
(Emily) I HOPE YOU BOTH
UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE

40:40.709 --> 40:42.811
OF MY PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT.

40:44.813 --> 40:47.445
CLEARLY,
LYDIA DIDN'T SHOOT ME.

40:49.117 --> 40:51.680
I KNOW IT WAS YOU,
DANIEL.

40:54.182 --> 40:57.856
BUT I FORGIVE YOU.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.227
I KNOW YOU ONLY
SOUGHT REVENGE

40:59.227 --> 41:02.190
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I DESERVED IT.

41:02.190 --> 41:05.063
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT I LOVE YOU.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.735
AND I JUST WANNA KNOW

41:06.735 --> 41:08.967
HOW WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THIS
MOVING FORWARD.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.739
(scoffs) SORRY.
GOING FORWARD?

41:10.739 --> 41:12.641
ARE--ARE--ARE YOU--
ARE YOU NUTS?

41:12.641 --> 41:14.603
DANIEL, SIT DOWN.

41:14.603 --> 41:15.844
BY COMING OUT TO THE PRESS,

41:15.844 --> 41:19.247
EMILY CEMENTED LYDIA'S FATE
AND SAVED YOURS.

41:19.247 --> 41:21.550
SO IT'S OUT THERE.
IT'S DONE.

41:21.550 --> 41:24.212
OH, BUT I CAN HAPPILY RETRACT
MY STATEMENT,

41:24.212 --> 41:25.854
TELL THE WORLD
I WAS FORCED INTO IT,

41:25.854 --> 41:28.557
AND NIKO CAN CONFIRM
YOUR MOTIVES

41:28.557 --> 41:30.258
IN SPIRITING ME
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

41:30.258 --> 41:32.260
GET ON WITH IT.

41:32.260 --> 41:35.093
NAME YOUR PRICE, NOW THAT WE
KNOW HOW YOU OPERATE.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.795
NOT THIS TIME.

41:36.795 --> 41:40.198
LIKE I SAID,
I LOVE YOUR SON...

41:40.198 --> 41:43.171
AND I LIKE THE LIFESTYLE.

41:43.171 --> 41:45.674
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

41:45.674 --> 41:48.176
OH.

41:48.176 --> 41:49.878
SEEMS WE'RE AT A STALEMATE.

41:49.878 --> 41:51.980
I'D SAY SO.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.281
SCREW YOU.

41:53.281 --> 41:57.015
I'VE ENDURED OVER 25 YEARS
IN A LOVELESS MARRIAGE.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.917
YOU TWO WILL FIGURE THINGS
OUT...

41:58.917 --> 42:02.090
UNTIL WE FIND
A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION.

42:07.095 --> 42:10.058
SEEMS I AM HOME
AFTER ALL.
