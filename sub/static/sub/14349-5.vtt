00:19.052 --> 00:21.452
That should make
a good specimen.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.024
Temperature's
starting to drop.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.024
Yeah.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.027
At night it gets down

00:29.129 --> 00:31.029
to 120 degrees below zero.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.031
That's nippy.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.031
Hey!

00:34.134 --> 00:35.533
[Rocks Sliding]

00:41.641 --> 00:43.040
What happened?

00:43.143 --> 00:45.543
I fell off
that bank, sir.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.044
Cut my hand.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.048
Get back to the ship.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.050
Report to the sick bay.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.055
Geological

00:58.158 --> 01:00.388
Ready to beam up.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.328
Locked onto you.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.068
Energize.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.543
[Beeping]

01:24.684 --> 01:27.016
Coadjutor engagement.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.596
What happened?

01:38.698 --> 01:40.598
I took a flop.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.099
Onto what?

01:42.202 --> 01:44.102
Some kind of yellow ore.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.104
Magnetic. Decontaminate
that uniform.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.537
Yes, sir.

01:48.708 --> 01:51.302
That acted
like a burnout.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.119
Captain Kirk
ready to beam up.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.124
Just one moment, Captain.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.630
It checks out OK now.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.132
You better get
a synchronic meter

02:15.235 --> 02:17.135
so we can double-check.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.141
All right, Captain.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.576
Locked onto you.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.676
Are you all right, Captain?

02:58.778 --> 03:01.679
Yes, I'm all right.
Just a little dizzy.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.681
I can't get through there.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.182
Nothing serious.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.685
Don't leave
the transporter room unattended.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.187
Wilson will
be right back, sir.

Space...

03:45.325 --> 03:47.225
the final frontier.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.228
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.628
Its five-year mission--

03:52.732 --> 03:56.190
to explore strange
new worlds,

03:56.302 --> 03:59.465
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:59.572 --> 04:03.770
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.903
Captain's Log,
stardate 1672.1.

04:38.011 --> 04:42.675
Specimen-gathering mission
on planet Alpha 177.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.683
Unknown to any of us
during this time,

04:45.785 --> 04:48.686
a duplicate of me,
some strange alter ego,

04:48.788 --> 04:52.690
had been created by
the transporter malfunction.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.204
[Door Opens]

05:10.310 --> 05:12.710
Captain? Are you
all right, sir?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.713
Can I give you a hand, sir?

05:17.850 --> 05:18.874
Captain?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.047
Bridge to all decks.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.216
Section duty officers,
check communication lines.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.623
Thank you.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.628
Maybe Dr. McCoy
should look at you.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.392
All right, Engineer,
I'll have my engines checked.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.142
Ship's manifests, sir.
They're in order.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.643
Thank you, Yeoman.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.145
That's all.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.646
Yes, sir.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.669
You picked a good day, Fisher.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.672
Business has been lousy.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.675
Did you fall on purpose
to get vacation?

06:19.779 --> 06:21.679
Saurian brandy.

06:23.783 --> 06:27.685
Back to duty status.
I have no sympathy for clumsiness.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.687
No, sir.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.191
The hand's much better, sir.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.699
What can I do
for you, Jim?

06:41.801 --> 06:44.201
I said,
give me the brandy!

07:28.915 --> 07:30.314
[Knock On Door]

07:30.416 --> 07:31.314
Yep?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.748
Mr. Spock.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.445
Come in.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.757
Yes, Mr. Spock,
what is it?

07:40.860 --> 07:44.557
Is there something
I can do for you, Captain?

07:44.664 --> 07:45.961
Like what?

07:47.400 --> 07:51.666
Well, Dr. McCoy seemed to think
I should check on you.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.261
That's nice.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.266
Come on, Spock,
I know that look.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.810
What is it?

07:59.912 --> 08:03.313
Well, our good doctor
said that you were acting

08:03.416 --> 08:06.874
Iike a wild man,

08:06.986 --> 08:08.283
demanded brandy.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.481
Our good doctor's
been putting you on again.

08:13.392 --> 08:14.586
Hmm.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.992
Well, in that case,

08:17.096 --> 08:18.791
if you'll excuse
the intrusion,

08:18.898 --> 08:20.661
I'll get back to work.

08:20.766 --> 08:24.258
I'll tell him
you were properly annoyed.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.304
Captain.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.309
What is it, Scotty?

08:33.412 --> 08:34.811
Transporter breakdown.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.813
We beamed up this animal--

08:36.916 --> 08:38.315
Look for yourself.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.850
It's in here.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.682
[Rrr Ruff Ruff]

08:42.788 --> 08:43.812
Yes?

08:43.923 --> 08:46.323
A few seconds
after they sent

08:46.425 --> 08:48.325
this one through the transporter,

08:48.427 --> 08:50.520
that duplicate appeared.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.190
Except it's an opposite.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.767
Two similar animals,
but different.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.597
One gentle--this.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.694
One mean and fierce--

08:59.805 --> 09:00.737
that.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.331
Some kind of savage,
ferocious opposite.

09:03.442 --> 09:06.343
Captain, we don't
dare send Mr. Sulu

09:06.445 --> 09:09.107
and the landing party up.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.343
If this should
happen to a man...

09:14.954 --> 09:17.115
Oh, my...

09:53.359 --> 09:54.485
Oh!

09:54.594 --> 09:55.754
Captain.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.261
You startled me.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.958
Is there something
that you--

10:10.876 --> 10:13.310
Can I help you, Captain?

10:13.412 --> 10:15.175
Jim will do here, Janice.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.181
Ohh.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.751
You're too beautiful to ignore.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.185
Too much woman.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.297
We've both been--

10:34.900 --> 10:36.868
pretending too long.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.802
Stop pretending.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.304
Aah!

10:41.407 --> 10:42.806
Let's stop pretending.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.309
Come here, Janice.
Don't fight me.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.812
Don't fight me, Janice.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.312
Captain!

10:54.420 --> 10:56.320
Just a minute, Janice.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.324
Just a minute!

11:18.444 --> 11:19.342
Aah!

11:21.447 --> 11:23.005
Call Mr. Spock!

11:23.115 --> 11:24.343
Call Mr. Spock!

11:26.619 --> 11:28.018
Geological
Technician Fisher.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.350
Deck 12, section--

11:35.194 --> 11:37.355
Me? My yeoman said that?

11:37.463 --> 11:40.364
I've been resting here
since you left me.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.865
Alone, Mr. Spock.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.595
Dr. McCoy reports
you demanded brandy

11:44.704 --> 11:47.366
in sick bay
and left with it.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.374
I found this bottle
in Yeoman Rand's quarters.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.377
Not true. I haven't
been to sick bay.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.879
Let's find out
what's going on.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.885
Sick bay.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.757
Then he kissed me

12:44.864 --> 12:46.764
and he said that we--

12:46.866 --> 12:48.527
that he was the captain,

12:48.634 --> 12:51.296
and he could order me.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.438
I didn't know what to do.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.445
When you mentioned
the feelings we'd been hiding,

13:01.547 --> 13:03.947
and you started
talking about us.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.448
Us?

13:05.551 --> 13:07.542
Well, you--

13:09.555 --> 13:11.455
He is the captain.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.457
I couldn't just--

13:13.559 --> 13:16.790
You started hurting me.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.956
I had to fight you,
scratch your face.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.124
Yeoman.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.462
And--

13:23.569 --> 13:24.968
Look at me.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.639
Look at my face.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.734
Are there any scratches?

13:35.247 --> 13:37.511
I was sure
I scratched you.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.481
I was frightened.
Maybe--

13:39.585 --> 13:40.483
Yeoman.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.714
I was in my room.
It wasn't me.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.389
Sir, Fisher saw you, too.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.893
Fisher saw--

13:51.297 --> 13:53.731
If it hadn't been--

13:55.601 --> 13:57.330
I can understand.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.505
I don't want to get
you into trouble.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.007
I wouldn't have
even mentioned it!

14:04.109 --> 14:05.337
It wasn't me!

14:05.444 --> 14:08.140
It was you, sir.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.378
Are you sure?

14:12.484 --> 14:14.884
Yes, sir. I'm sure.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.090
Back to that bed, bucko.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.037
You can go now, Yeoman.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.038
There's only
one logical answer.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.413
We have an impostor aboard.

14:53.192 --> 14:56.593
Captain's Log,
stardate 1672.9.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.595
On the planet's surface,

14:58.697 --> 15:00.597
temperatures
are beginning to drop,

15:00.699 --> 15:03.600
our landing party there
in growing jeopardy.

15:03.702 --> 15:06.603
Due to the malfunction
of the ship's transporter,

15:06.705 --> 15:09.606
an unexplained duplicate
of myself definitely exists.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.608
How did all this happen?

15:11.710 --> 15:14.611
When Fisher came up,
his suit was covered

15:14.713 --> 15:16.613
with a soft yellow ore

15:16.715 --> 15:18.615
that had highly
unusual properties.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.776
It may have caused
an overload.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.218
Does the transporter
work at all?

15:23.322 --> 15:27.258
Yes, but if we transport
the landing party, it might duplicate.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.624
How long will it take
to find the trouble?

15:30.729 --> 15:32.128
Can't say, sir.

15:32.231 --> 15:35.632
We just can't leave
those four men down there.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.634
It's getting dark.
They'll die!

15:37.736 --> 15:41.638
The surface temperature goes
down to 120 degrees below zero.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.004
We're doing everything
we can, sir.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.634
Yes, I know, Scotty.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.654
About your double, Captain.

15:57.756 --> 16:00.657
Yes, uh...yes.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.659
We'll have to find him.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.661
Search parties, Mr. Spock.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.162
Organize search parties.

16:06.265 --> 16:09.166
We can't take a chance
on killing it.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.169
We don't know what
would happen to you.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.171
That's right.
We don't know,

16:14.273 --> 16:17.674
but the men
have to be armed...

16:17.776 --> 16:20.176
The men are to be armed,

16:20.279 --> 16:22.179
with their phasers locked,

16:22.281 --> 16:24.181
I repeat, locked,

16:24.283 --> 16:26.046
on setting number one.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.987
There can't be any chance

16:30.089 --> 16:32.182
of him being killed.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.191
He's to be taken without...

16:34.293 --> 16:37.194
If the men are
forced to fire,

16:37.296 --> 16:39.196
he can't be killed!

16:39.298 --> 16:42.199
How shall we explain it
to them, Captain?

16:42.301 --> 16:45.202
The search parties
are to capture you?

16:45.304 --> 16:46.703
Tell them...

16:47.806 --> 16:49.706
The search parties,
Captain.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.709
I'll make an announcement
to the entire crew,

16:52.811 --> 16:54.711
tell them what happened.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.713
It's a good crew.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.715
They deserve to know.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.216
Captain,
no disrespect intended,

17:00.319 --> 17:01.911
but you must surely realize

17:02.021 --> 17:05.422
you can't announce
the full truth to the crew.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.425
You haven't the right
to be vulnerable

17:08.527 --> 17:10.722
in the eyes of the crew.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.229
If you're anything
less than perfect,

17:13.332 --> 17:15.630
they lose faith,
and you lose command.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.224
Yes, I do know that,
Mr. Spock.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.738
What I don't know...

17:23.842 --> 17:26.834
is why I forgot
that just now.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.254
Mr. Spock.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.760
If you see me
slipping again,

17:43.862 --> 17:45.261
your orders...

17:47.866 --> 17:49.265
your orders...

17:51.370 --> 17:53.270
are to tell me.

17:53.372 --> 17:54.771
Understood, Captain.

18:02.448 --> 18:07.283
Captain's Log,
stardate 1673.1.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.787
Something has happened to me.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.880
Somehow, in being duplicated,

18:12.991 --> 18:16.290
I have lost
my strength of will.

18:16.395 --> 18:21.856
Decisions are becoming
more and more difficult.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.800
This is
the captain speaking.

18:24.903 --> 18:27.303
There's an impostor
aboard the ship,

18:27.406 --> 18:30.273
a man who looks
exactly like me.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.808
This man is dangerous.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.811
Utmost caution
is to be observed.

18:34.913 --> 18:38.314
All crew members
are to arm themselves.

18:38.417 --> 18:42.319
The impostor may be identified
by scratches on his face.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.821
Repeat--the impostor
may be identified

18:44.923 --> 18:46.857
by scratches on his face.

18:46.959 --> 18:51.328
Section chiefs,
assign personnel to the search.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.796
All search parties

18:53.899 --> 18:58.165
report to...Mr. Spock
for assignment.

19:01.940 --> 19:02.838
Something?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.841
About the phaser weapons.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.844
To be set for stunning
force and locked.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.345
Oh, yes, yes.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.348
All hand phasers

19:11.450 --> 19:13.850
must be set on base cycle,

19:13.952 --> 19:16.182
stunning force.

19:16.288 --> 19:19.189
The impostor is
not to be injured.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.690
Use minimum force.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.953
I'm Captain Kirk!

19:23.061 --> 19:24.858
--Is not to be injured.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.864
I'm Captain Kirk.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.369
I'm Captain Kirk!

19:32.471 --> 19:35.872
I'm Captain Kirk!

19:47.986 --> 19:49.886
I'm Captain Kirk!

20:20.986 --> 20:21.884
Wilson!

20:21.987 --> 20:22.885
Sir?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.889
Wilson, give me your phaser.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.152
Yes, sir.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.895
How have you been?

20:31.997 --> 20:33.897
Fine, sir.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.404
How's it going down there,
Mr. Sulu?

20:41.506 --> 20:43.906
It's already
20 degrees below zero.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.910
Can't exactly call it balmy.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.414
Isn't there any way
we can help them?

20:51.516 --> 20:53.416
Thermal heaters were
transported down.

20:53.518 --> 20:54.917
They duplicated.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.419
They won't operate.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.422
Then we've got to
get those men up.

20:59.524 --> 21:00.923
Mr. Spock?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.425
Spock here.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.496
Transporter Technician
Wilson found injured

21:05.597 --> 21:07.428
near the captain's cabin.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.932
He says the impostor
attacked him,

21:10.035 --> 21:12.936
called him by name,
took his hand phaser.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.509
Acknowledged.
Continue the search.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.773
We've got to
find him before he--

21:21.880 --> 21:23.871
But how?

21:23.982 --> 21:25.449
Apparently,
this double,

21:25.550 --> 21:27.450
however different
in temperament,

21:27.552 --> 21:29.952
has your knowledge
of the ship--

21:30.055 --> 21:32.853
its crew, its devices.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.951
This being the case,
perhaps we can outguess him

21:37.062 --> 21:38.962
by determining
his next move.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.464
Knowing how the ship
is designed,

21:41.566 --> 21:44.330
where would you go
to elude a search?

21:49.074 --> 21:50.473
The lower levels.

21:50.575 --> 21:51.906
The engineering deck.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.187
Set and locked
on base cycle

22:10.295 --> 22:12.195
to stun, not to kill.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.704
What about your phaser, Captain?

22:30.816 --> 22:34.217
Don't you think we ought
to get some help?

22:34.319 --> 22:38.221
No. I don't want
anyone else to see the...

22:38.323 --> 22:41.224
Captain, you ordered me to tell you.

22:41.326 --> 22:45.228
Mr. Spock, if I'm
to be the captain,

22:45.330 --> 22:48.231
I've got to act like one.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.597
You can't hurt me.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.335
You can't kill me.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.879
You can't.
Don't you understand?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.039
I'm part of you.

24:45.450 --> 24:46.849
You need me.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.445
I need you.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.893
I don't need you.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.102
[Electrical Crackling]

25:21.987 --> 25:23.887
He'll be regaining
consciousness soon,

25:23.989 --> 25:26.890
and not knowing what
his physical state is,

25:26.992 --> 25:29.290
I won't give him
a tranquilizer.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.891
We'd better bind him.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.437
Yes...yes. All right.

25:45.510 --> 25:47.410
What's the matter with me?

25:47.512 --> 25:49.241
Judging from
my observations, Captain,

25:49.347 --> 25:51.747
you're losing
the power of decision.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.909
You have a point, Spock?

25:54.019 --> 25:56.419
Yes. Always, Doctor.
We have here

25:56.521 --> 25:59.422
an unusual opportunity
to appraise the human mind,

25:59.524 --> 26:01.856
or to examine, in Earth terms,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.793
the roles of good and evil

26:04.896 --> 26:06.261
in a man--

26:06.364 --> 26:07.763
his negative side,

26:07.866 --> 26:12.462
which you call hostility,
lust, violence,

26:12.571 --> 26:14.436
and his positive side,

26:14.539 --> 26:18.134
which Earth people
express as compassion,

26:18.243 --> 26:20.302
Iove, tenderness.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.643
Are you aware it's
the captain's guts you're analyzing?

26:23.748 --> 26:27.946
Yes, and what makes one man
an exceptional leader?

26:28.053 --> 26:30.851
We see indications
that it's his negative side

26:30.956 --> 26:32.947
which makes him strong,

26:33.058 --> 26:36.027
that his evil side,
controlled and disciplined,

26:36.127 --> 26:38.061
is vital to his strength.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.961
Your negative side
removed from you,

26:41.066 --> 26:44.524
the power of command
begins to elude you.

26:44.636 --> 26:47.901
What is your point,
Mr. Spock?

26:48.006 --> 26:50.304
If your power of command weakens,

26:50.408 --> 26:52.706
you'll be unable
to be captain.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.211
You must be
prepared for that.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.076
You have your intellect, Jim.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.082
You can fight with that!

26:59.184 --> 27:00.617
For how long?

27:02.087 --> 27:03.987
If I seem insensitive

27:04.089 --> 27:05.989
to what you're going through,

27:06.091 --> 27:09.151
understand--
it's the way I am.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.660
Captain Kirk.

27:17.102 --> 27:18.501
Kirk here.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.002
Mr. Scott, sir,

27:20.105 --> 27:22.471
on the lower level
of the engineering deck.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.475
I found the new trouble
with the transporter.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.512
The casing has a gap ripped in it.

27:28.613 --> 27:29.910
The main circuits

27:30.015 --> 27:32.006
have been burned through.

27:32.117 --> 27:35.018
The abort control circuit
is gone altogether.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.526
Can you give us
a status report, Captain?

27:43.628 --> 27:45.027
Temperature's still dropping.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.030
Now 41 degrees below zero.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.032
We've located the trouble.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.034
It shouldn't be much longer.

27:51.136 --> 27:54.037
Could you find
a long rope somewhere

27:54.139 --> 27:57.267
and lower us down
a pot of hot coffee?

28:00.145 --> 28:02.545
I'll see what we can do.

28:02.647 --> 28:06.048
Rice wine will do,
if you're short on coffee.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.060
Engineering deck,
Kirk here.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.562
Scott here, Captain.

28:19.664 --> 28:23.065
That unit, Scotty,
status report.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.068
The transporter unit
ionizer--

28:25.170 --> 28:28.071
Nothing much left of it, sir.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.073
How bad is it?

28:30.175 --> 28:33.576
We can't repair it
in less than a week.

28:38.149 --> 28:43.587
Captain's Log,
stardate 1673.5.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.588
Transporter still inoperable.

28:45.690 --> 28:46.816
My negative self

28:46.925 --> 28:49.223
is under restraint in sick bay.

28:49.327 --> 28:53.286
My own indecisiveness growing.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.525
My force of will
steadily weakening.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.533
On the planet, condition critical.

28:57.635 --> 29:01.662
Surface temperature
is 75 degrees below zero,

29:01.773 --> 29:03.673
still dropping.

29:19.290 --> 29:23.192
I think we ought to give
room service another call.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.694
That coffee's
taking too long.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.666
Enterprise,
this is Sulu.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.204
Kirk here, Mr. Sulu.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.705
Hot line
direct to the captain?

29:36.808 --> 29:39.208
Are we that far gone?

29:39.310 --> 29:41.540
I gave everybody
the afternoon off.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.511
I'm watching the store.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.515
How is it down there?

29:45.617 --> 29:46.709
Oh, lovely,

29:46.818 --> 29:49.719
except that the frost
is building up.

29:49.821 --> 29:53.222
We're using hand phasers
to heat the rocks.

29:53.324 --> 29:55.224
One phaser quit on us.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.226
Three still operating.

29:57.328 --> 30:00.229
Any possibility
of getting us back aboard

30:00.331 --> 30:03.232
before the skiing season
opens down here?

30:05.837 --> 30:07.737
This is Spock, Mr. Sulu.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.740
You'll have to hold on
a little longer.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.742
There's no other way.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.744
Survival procedures, Mr. Sulu.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.872
Per your training program,
Mr. Spock.

30:22.587 --> 30:25.181
Aah!

30:25.290 --> 30:27.258
Aah!

30:27.358 --> 30:29.519
Aah!

30:29.627 --> 30:32.687
Aah!

30:32.797 --> 30:34.264
Aah!

30:46.411 --> 30:47.776
What happened?

30:47.879 --> 30:49.779
Apparently
the body functioning weakened

30:49.881 --> 30:51.781
during
the duplication process--

30:51.883 --> 30:54.283
A fact I failed to consider.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.285
He's not dying?

30:56.387 --> 30:58.787
Yes, he is.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.120
Help me.

31:01.226 --> 31:03.285
How can he die?

31:03.394 --> 31:05.294
Can I survive
without him?

31:05.396 --> 31:07.364
I don't know, Jim.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.302
Don't be afraid.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.640
Here's my hand.

31:17.742 --> 31:20.302
Hold on.

31:22.981 --> 31:25.176
You don't have to be afraid.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.750
Hold on!

31:26.851 --> 31:30.617
You won't be afraid
if you use your mind!

31:30.722 --> 31:31.620
That's it!

31:41.933 --> 31:44.333
Jim, he is back!

31:54.445 --> 31:55.844
Jim.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.848
You can use
that brandy now.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.851
In fact, I'll join you.

32:01.953 --> 32:04.353
I have to
take him back...

32:04.455 --> 32:05.854
inside myself.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.857
I can't survive
without him.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.688
I don't want him back.

32:09.794 --> 32:13.286
He's like an animal,
a thoughtless, brutal animal,

32:13.398 --> 32:15.366
and yet it's me...

32:15.466 --> 32:16.865
me.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.872
Jim... you're no different
than anyone else.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.374
We all have
our darker side.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.875
We need it!

32:26.978 --> 32:29.378
It's half of what we are.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.380
It's not ugly.
It's human.

32:31.482 --> 32:32.881
Human.

32:32.984 --> 32:37.387
A lot of what he is
makes you the man you are.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.820
God forbid I should
agree with Spock,

32:39.924 --> 32:41.892
but he was right.

32:41.993 --> 32:43.722
Without the negative side,

32:43.828 --> 32:45.557
you couldn't be the captain.

32:45.663 --> 32:49.895
Your strength of command
lies mostly in him.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.670
What do I have?

32:54.772 --> 32:56.330
You have the goodness.

32:56.441 --> 32:59.205
Not enough.
I have a ship to command.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.403
The intelligence,
the logic--

33:01.512 --> 33:04.413
It appears your half
has most of that,

33:04.515 --> 33:09.919
and perhaps that's where
man's essential courage comes from.

33:10.021 --> 33:13.650
For you see,
he was afraid,

33:13.758 --> 33:14.918
and you weren't.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.685
Captain Kirk.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.430
Kirk here.

33:21.532 --> 33:22.931
Spock here.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.934
Come to the transporter room.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.436
We may have found an answer.

33:27.538 --> 33:28.937
Coming.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.452
What is it?

33:43.554 --> 33:45.454
We got the transporter working.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.457
We've attached to some bypass
and leader circuits

33:48.559 --> 33:50.459
to compensate
for the difference,

33:50.561 --> 33:52.961
tied directly
into the impulse engines.

33:53.064 --> 33:55.965
There shouldn't be more
than a 5-point variation

33:56.067 --> 33:57.967
in the velocity balance.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.970
I suggest
we send the animal through.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.304
Captain?

34:05.410 --> 34:06.570
Yes. Go ahead.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.418
[Growling And Snarling]

34:17.789 --> 34:20.724
I'll hold him
as long as I can.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.000
Don't hurt him.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.831
It's painless and quick.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.839
The animal will be unconscious
for only a few minutes.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.070
[Buzzing]

34:47.118 --> 34:51.077
[Scott] lf this doesn't work,
I don't know what will.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.262
Energize.

35:27.024 --> 35:28.787
Reverse.

36:04.529 --> 36:06.793
The shock of putting him
back together

36:06.898 --> 36:08.866
was too much for him.

36:08.966 --> 36:10.627
He's dead, Jim.

36:19.243 --> 36:23.873
[Spock]
Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.144
Entry made
by Second Officer Spock.

36:27.251 --> 36:30.186
Captain Kirk
retains command of this vessel,

36:30.288 --> 36:33.519
but his force of will
rapidly fading.

36:33.624 --> 36:36.821
Condition of landing party critical.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.625
Transporter unit
still under repair.

36:43.467 --> 36:46.129
Autopsy in-depth. Hurry.

36:50.741 --> 36:52.140
I don't know.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.143
Animal could have died

36:54.245 --> 36:56.145
of some kind of shock.

36:56.247 --> 36:58.647
For once,
I agree with you.

36:58.749 --> 37:00.649
I said "could have," Spock.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.652
We won't know until
we get a post-mortem.

37:03.754 --> 37:08.157
No autopsy is necessary to know
that the animal was terrified.

37:08.259 --> 37:11.660
It was split into two
and thrust back together.

37:11.762 --> 37:14.162
Thus shock induced
by blind terror.

37:14.265 --> 37:15.664
That sounds likely.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.666
It couldn't understand. You can.

37:17.768 --> 37:20.669
You have your intelligence
controlling your fear.

37:21.939 --> 37:24.169
Get the transporter room ready.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.175
Could be, if, maybe--

37:26.277 --> 37:27.608
All guesswork,
just theory.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.771
Give me a chance
to do an autopsy

37:29.880 --> 37:32.246
and let Spock check
the transporter circuits again.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.011
That sounds reasonable.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.484
We should
double-check everything.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.987
Aren't you
forgetting something, Captain?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.285
No, I don't think I f--

37:41.392 --> 37:43.292
Your men on the planet,

37:43.394 --> 37:45.794
how much time do they have?

37:45.896 --> 37:47.295
Yes. The men.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.958
We have to take the chance.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.967
Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim.

37:52.069 --> 37:53.832
Suppose death was caused

37:53.938 --> 37:55.337
by transporter malfunction.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.963
Then you'd die.

37:57.074 --> 37:58.473
They'd die, anyway.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.908
Don't risk your life
on a theory!

38:01.012 --> 38:03.037
Being split in two halves

38:03.147 --> 38:05.581
is no theory with me, Doctor.

38:05.683 --> 38:08.743
I have a human half
and an alien half

38:08.853 --> 38:10.787
at war with each other.

38:10.888 --> 38:14.824
Personal experience, Doctor.

38:14.925 --> 38:17.325
I survive because
my intelligence wins,

38:17.428 --> 38:19.453
makes them live together.

38:19.563 --> 38:23.124
Your intelligence would
enable you to survive, as well.

38:31.575 --> 38:34.066
Help me.

38:34.178 --> 38:38.205
Somebody make the decision.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.583
Are you relinquishing
command, Captain?

38:46.090 --> 38:47.990
No.

38:48.092 --> 38:49.650
No, I'm not.

38:51.395 --> 38:54.990
Well, then we
can't help you, Jim.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.499
The decision is yours.

39:01.105 --> 39:04.006
Mr. Spock,
ready the transporter room.

39:05.609 --> 39:10.012
Bones, continue the autopsy.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.879
[Uhura]
Captain Kirk,

39:43.981 --> 39:46.882
I have a tie-in with Sulu now.

39:51.655 --> 39:52.986
Kirk here.

39:55.659 --> 40:02.565
Captain...K-Kirk...
Sulu here.

40:02.633 --> 40:10.039
117 b-below.

40:10.141 --> 40:14.703
Can't...last much longer.

40:20.584 --> 40:25.544
Can't see clearly, Doctor,

40:25.656 --> 40:29.558
to read top indicator.

40:29.660 --> 40:37.066
Think the cold...
penetrating communicator.

40:39.170 --> 40:44.073
Two men...unconscious.

40:46.177 --> 40:49.078
No time.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.581
No...

40:52.683 --> 40:56.585
Can't wait. No time.

40:58.689 --> 41:01.089
Mr. Sulu.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.092
Mr. Sulu.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.602
Can't wait.

41:13.704 --> 41:16.298
Can't let them die.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.931
What will you do?

41:19.710 --> 41:23.111
Go through the transporter,
both of us.

41:29.286 --> 41:32.119
There's nothing
I can do to stop you?

41:35.726 --> 41:38.456
It's what I have to do.

41:39.897 --> 41:42.127
It's what I have to do,

41:42.233 --> 41:44.133
what we have to do.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.140
I won't fight you anymore.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.644
Oh...

41:55.746 --> 41:57.646
I feel so weak.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.151
I'll be glad
when this is over.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.167
Janice, hello.

42:27.278 --> 42:28.677
Captain, l--

42:28.779 --> 42:31.179
Yeoman, I owe you
an explanation.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.182
The transporter
malfunctioned,

42:33.284 --> 42:36.185
divided me,
created a duplicate.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.688
The animal part of me
came to your cabin.

42:39.790 --> 42:43.692
He even scratched me
to make us look more alike.

42:43.794 --> 42:47.195
I'd like the chance
to explain it to you.

42:48.799 --> 42:52.235
You don't mind if
I come to your cabin later?

42:53.804 --> 42:55.431
No, sir.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.005
Bridge.

43:03.814 --> 43:06.214
No word from Mr. Sulu, sir.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.717
Prepare to leave orbit,
Mr. Farrell.

43:08.819 --> 43:10.218
Captain--

43:10.321 --> 43:13.620
I gave you an order.
They can't be saved.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.715
Prepare to leave orbit.

43:15.826 --> 43:17.623
Yes, sir.

43:17.728 --> 43:19.127
Captain, I thought--

43:19.229 --> 43:21.220
I've changed my mind.

43:26.670 --> 43:28.035
[Door Opens]

43:33.143 --> 43:35.338
Grab him.
He's the impostor.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.913
No!

43:37.014 --> 43:38.914
McCoy, he's fooled you.

43:39.016 --> 43:41.075
He attacked him.

43:42.853 --> 43:46.983
Mr. Spock, you know who I am
and what that is.

43:47.091 --> 43:48.683
Mr. Spock, which one?

43:48.792 --> 43:50.760
What do we do?

43:52.363 --> 43:55.628
We'll let the captain
handle this.

43:55.733 --> 43:58.429
I'm the captain.
Isn't that obvious?

43:58.535 --> 44:01.595
Look at his face.
Remember the scratches?

44:01.705 --> 44:02.899
He's hiding them.

44:03.007 --> 44:06.374
He wants you to think
that he's Captain Kirk.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.211
You know who I am.

44:21.091 --> 44:22.388
Yes, I know.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.121
You want to kill me,
don't you?

44:26.830 --> 44:31.267
Farrell, James, grab him!
He'll destroy the ship!

44:31.368 --> 44:34.826
Don't you understand?
I'm captain of the ship!

44:34.938 --> 44:36.303
I'm the captain!

44:36.407 --> 44:38.807
This is my ship!
My ship!

44:38.909 --> 44:40.308
It's mine!

44:47.051 --> 44:48.985
I'll kill you.

44:49.086 --> 44:51.816
Can half a man live?

44:53.424 --> 44:56.689
Take another step,
you'll die.

44:58.095 --> 45:00.825
Then we'll both die.

45:04.935 --> 45:06.129
Please.

45:08.439 --> 45:10.669
I don't want to.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.833
Don't make me.

45:18.949 --> 45:21.349
I don't want to go back.

45:21.452 --> 45:22.851
Please!

45:22.953 --> 45:25.080
I want to live!

45:25.189 --> 45:26.850
You will.

45:26.957 --> 45:29.858
Both of us.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.861
I want to live!

45:41.972 --> 45:44.873
You'll have to hold on
to him, Captain.

45:46.477 --> 45:48.377
Mr. Spock.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.140
Captain?

45:50.247 --> 45:51.714
If this doesn't work...

45:54.485 --> 45:56.043
Understood, Captain.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.762
Mr. Spock.

46:15.506 --> 46:17.406
Ready.

46:39.930 --> 46:42.057
Well, Mr. Spock?

47:16.366 --> 47:18.197
Jim?

47:22.573 --> 47:25.041
Get those men aboard fast.

47:25.142 --> 47:27.474
Right away, Captain.

47:36.086 --> 47:37.986
Severe exposure and frostbite,

47:38.088 --> 47:40.989
but I think they'll make it.

47:41.091 --> 47:42.956
How do you feel, Jim?

47:43.060 --> 47:44.493
How?

47:46.096 --> 47:50.965
I've seen a part of myself
no man should ever see.

47:58.609 --> 48:00.509
Status report, green.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.511
All sections report ready, sir.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.808
Good.

48:04.915 --> 48:06.849
Thank you, Mr. Spock...

48:06.950 --> 48:08.941
from both of us.

48:09.052 --> 48:12.385
Shall I pass that on
to the crew, sir?

48:12.489 --> 48:15.720
The impostor's where he belongs.
Let's forget him.

48:22.332 --> 48:24.027
Captain.

48:24.134 --> 48:26.534
The impostor told me
what happened,

48:26.637 --> 48:28.901
who he really was,

48:29.006 --> 48:31.873
and I'd just
like to say that...

48:31.975 --> 48:33.067
well, sir,

48:33.176 --> 48:34.575
what I'd like--

48:34.678 --> 48:36.305
Thank you, Yeoman.

48:44.655 --> 48:49.615
The, uh, impostor had
some interesting qualities,

48:49.726 --> 48:52.388
wouldn't you say, Yeoman?

48:57.668 --> 49:00.136
This is
the captain speaking.

49:00.237 --> 49:03.070
Navigator,
set in course correction.

49:03.173 --> 49:06.939
Helmsman,
steady as she goes.
