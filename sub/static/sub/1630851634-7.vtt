-Get your hands off me!

00:21.938 --> 00:23.898
-I'm Ryan Goodwin.
-Go.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.236
-If something's wrong, tell me.
-I'm buying a vineyard.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.073
My dad is a lot worse than I thought.
I went into his office.

00:32.157 --> 00:36.244
And he has
all this insane conspiracy shit,

00:36.327 --> 00:37.954
including you and Joe.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.456
We are a team.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.959
The best team.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.802
[Joe] Marriage is a game.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.554
["Feel Good" playing]

00:54.637 --> 00:56.431
When things are going well,

00:56.514 --> 00:59.809
my wife and I are on the same side,
an unshakable team.

-Oh, my God! That is impossible.
-Yeah!

01:14.949 --> 01:17.368
-Go do it. Be better.
-Okay, I got this.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.705
-[Joe] Right now, my game...
-We are so good at this.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.041
...is being a good husband-- No, no.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.584
No, the best husband,

01:24.667 --> 01:28.338
so Love doesn't get suspicious
about what's really going on.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.342
That I can't stop thinking about you,
Marienne.

01:33.051 --> 01:37.555
It's been two days
since our sprinkler-soaked night.

01:37.639 --> 01:41.309
You haven't texted, but I know better
than to overplay my hand.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.727
[all laughing]

02:12.882 --> 02:13.842
[cell phone chimes]

02:50.920 --> 02:54.465
All right, so far, so good.
He's gonna meet me to talk.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.718
[Joe]
If I wasn't so in love with you, Marienne,

02:56.801 --> 02:59.012
I might find this more upsetting,

02:59.095 --> 03:03.182
but as it stands,
I have to play just jealous enough.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.602
You had to deploy your lace bra for that?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.021
Yeah.

03:09.439 --> 03:14.611
I know it's all a bit spooky, but...
It also kind of feels like no big deal.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.323
[Joe] Is it just me
or doth the lady protest kind of a lot?

03:18.406 --> 03:21.910
The sooner we find out
what Matthew could have on us,

03:21.993 --> 03:25.038
if anything,
the sooner we can fix it, right?

03:25.121 --> 03:27.999
[Joe] She might be more attracted to Theo
than she's willing to admit,

03:28.082 --> 03:29.751
but she's also right and distracted,

03:29.834 --> 03:33.463
which is necessary to keep her
from Spidey-sensing you. Speaking of...

03:33.546 --> 03:37.050
Oh, the library fundraiser is coming up.

03:37.133 --> 03:41.679
My boss asked me to stay late
the next couple of nights.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.473
Uh, I would have said no.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.392
But I think that will make her
even more irritable than usual,

03:46.476 --> 03:48.228
so I hope that's okay.

03:48.311 --> 03:52.690
Yeah. I mean, of course. Should I...?
Should I put it in my calendar?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.901
[Joe] And have you both cross? No, no, no.

03:54.984 --> 03:59.113
It'll be pretty boring.
I wouldn't want to inflict that upon you.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.451
How'd I end up
with such a thoughtful husband?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.161
[Joe] This game is tricky.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.372
Juggling you and Love won't be easy.

04:07.455 --> 04:11.918
But if this is the game I have to play
to get closer to you, then game on.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.764
[Joe] Though you haven't texted me back,
Marienne,

04:24.847 --> 04:27.225
I know you felt what I felt in the rain.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.768
This seems elaborate.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.980
Yeah, and Alice in Wonderland,
a story dear

04:32.063 --> 04:35.692
to friends-of-the-library chairwoman
Sherry Conrad, which is fabulous...

04:35.775 --> 04:38.736
[Joe] You feel it right now.
You're pretending you don't.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.656
And don't get me started
on how the friends of the library

04:41.739 --> 04:43.992
only visit the library
when there's a gala.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.869
[Joe] You're cautious about us,
which is smart.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.497
But it means
I need to be a little bit bold.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.207
I thought about you all weekend.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.835
Really?

04:53.918 --> 04:54.836
Um...

04:57.005 --> 05:02.093
'Cause I couldn't stop thinking
about those goats that faint

05:02.176 --> 05:03.636
when they're startled.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.222
You know, like, what the fuck, Darwin?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.685
-I thought about you too. A lot.
-[Joe] I knew it.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.604
-But it can't happen again.
-[Joe] And here's the speech.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.066
Look, I gave it a lot of thought,
and for so many reasons,

05:17.150 --> 05:20.403
-first and foremost being you're married--
-That's true.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.114
But it's not that simple, I promise you.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.577
I understand.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.538
...that if I push too hard,
I risk losing you.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.956
Mommy.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.125
Hey, no running, remember?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.295
Ryan surprised me
by dropping her here this morning,

05:37.378 --> 05:39.255
but she's having so much fun helping out.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.091
-Aren't you, mon petit chou?
-[Joe] I didn't think it was possible,

05:42.175 --> 05:45.094
but in her presence,
you are even more exquisite.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.554
You must be Juliette.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.805
Hmm?

05:49.265 --> 05:51.809
-Look what Dante found for me.
-Oh.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.730
Is that Hans Christian Andersen?
Let me guess. Little Mermaid fan.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.647
Hey, Dante.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.565
Hey.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.608
Aw.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.905
-Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
-Yeah. Someone was doing cartwheels.

06:03.988 --> 06:08.951
Okay, we're going to have
to get these fixed before your dad sees.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.328
I can cover for you.

06:10.411 --> 06:14.332
Thanks, but my car is in the shop.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.541
Let me take you.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.752
Does he have to come?

06:17.835 --> 06:19.921
[Joe] Ouch. What'd I do to her?

06:20.004 --> 06:23.674
Sorry. Yes, that would be great.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.885
-Thank you.
-[cell phone buzzes]

06:26.469 --> 06:28.471
Hey. I'll get back to it.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.431
-Hey.
-Mom still hasn't shown up

06:30.515 --> 06:31.891
and she won't answer my calls.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.435
Isn't today the meeting
to finalize her divorce?

06:34.519 --> 06:37.355
Yeah, three hours ago. I mean, she flaked.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.315
Classic Dottie.

06:39.398 --> 06:42.193
[sighs] Any chance you could watch Henry?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.986
[Joe] Me, you and our kids,

06:44.070 --> 06:46.656
it's not exactly the quality time
I had in mind today,

06:46.739 --> 06:49.242
but what would the perfect husband do?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.244
Sure. I'll be there soon.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.540
-Okay. Thanks.
-[knocking on door]

06:57.458 --> 06:59.544
-Hi.
-I'm sorry to pop by like this,

06:59.627 --> 07:02.505
-but I just heard something terrible.
-What?

07:03.548 --> 07:07.135
My caterer, for the library fundraiser,
got frostbite.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.928
-Too much infrared sauna.
-Oh, my God.

07:09.011 --> 07:13.182
So she's out.
Then I realized, you could fill in.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.142
Oh.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.521
I mean, that's really flattering,

07:18.604 --> 07:21.023
but I haven't catered in a long time.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.818
Don't be silly.
I'm sure it's like riding a Peloton.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.403
I have to develop a menu.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.656
-I'd have to hire people.
-I will handle staff and logistics.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.533
You do the food,

07:30.616 --> 07:33.870
collect the compliments,
get exposure for your business.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.955
Don't make me beg.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.129
-Okay.
-Mm! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.798
Mm...

07:46.382 --> 07:49.051
-What?
-You have a glow about you

07:49.135 --> 07:51.012
and I noticed it on game night too.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.138
Yeah, I mean...

07:53.764 --> 07:54.932
I took your advice.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.727
-About choosing your soul mate.
-Mm.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.730
Joe has been so attentive lately.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.858
I love that. And the sex life?

08:03.941 --> 08:05.860
Back on track, I assume?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.822
[tsking] No. I don't mean to pry.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.949
No, Joe's just been really busy with work.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.368
No judgment. Have you seen the studies

08:14.452 --> 08:17.538
on how quickly
our sex parts get bored of each other?

08:17.622 --> 08:22.043
But, you know,
it doesn't have to be an issue.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.129
You are so hot, Love.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.840
-Just hack your sex life.
-Like...

08:28.549 --> 08:29.759
with supplements?

08:30.927 --> 08:34.472
A lot of ways to increase Joe's libido.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.518
Tap into his fantasies,
really make him feel like a man.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.730
It's what I've done with Cary,
and my vagina has never been happier.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.566
Look, I'll send you a post
I wrote about it.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.528
Along with an RSVP list of the guests

08:48.611 --> 08:50.238
-with food allergies.
-Okay.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.822
Thanks again.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.366
[chuckling]

08:53.449 --> 08:54.575
Whoo!

09:03.125 --> 09:05.920
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry. Sorry. I know, I'm early.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.422
-Yeah. Thank you for meeting me.
-Yeah.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.593
Oh, that's--
That's not why I asked you here.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.636
Okay.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.597
Um...

09:16.681 --> 09:22.061
Sorry, I feel like there's mixed signals,
'cause, like, first, we have sex.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.647
-Can you--?
-It's all right. And then you know...

09:25.815 --> 09:28.150
You say that it can't happen again,

09:28.234 --> 09:32.697
and then you're, like,
stripping at your window,

09:32.780 --> 09:35.074
asking me to meet in secret.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.367
Yeah, you're right.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.496
You're right. I'm a mess.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.375
I guess this is what happens
when your parents get divorced

09:44.458 --> 09:46.961
and you see how easily
your own marriage can fall apart.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.880
-Are you and Joe--?
-Oh, no, no, no.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.674
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-Hey.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.593
You're not alone.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.845
Honestly, like,

09:57.054 --> 09:58.097
we're friends.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.476
I'm your friend, if you need anything.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.813
Okay.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.609
I mean...

10:11.402 --> 10:14.405
-if you really wanna help...
-Mm-hm?

10:14.488 --> 10:17.283
Could you find out
what your dad has on me and Joe?

10:17.366 --> 10:21.203
What--? What do you mean?
What does he have?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.247
-I don't know. That's the thing.
-Okay.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.750
Then-- Then why?

10:26.584 --> 10:27.877
I-- I mean--

10:28.711 --> 10:32.214
We've talked about this.
My family's in the public eye.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.343
My parents are chopping off
each other's heads in this divorce.

10:35.426 --> 10:39.013
-It shouldn't make my family interesting--
-If it's not like a literal crime,

10:39.096 --> 10:43.309
-he's not gonna show anyone.
-But this is a major trigger for me.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.812
I can't help but worry
when people have information on my family.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.027
-I know it's not rational--
-It doesn't have to be.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.570
I get it. I do.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.408
-People are fucking vampires.
-[chuckles]

10:59.492 --> 11:01.869
You know, that can scar you for sure.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.037
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:04.789 --> 11:05.665
Yeah.

11:07.041 --> 11:07.958
You get it.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.592
Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, you know,
I'll sneak into his office.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.928
See what I can find.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.225
Thank you.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.274
[Joe] What's your favorite fairy tale?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.235
-[Marienne] Jack and the Beanstalk.
-No.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.530
Yes. Hell, yes. Jack was a little badass.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.700
I wanted to be him. Screw princesses.
I know I wanted to...

11:44.954 --> 11:51.710
[Joe] How do I make you see
I could be your happily ever after?

11:54.755 --> 11:58.592
Hey, can I say something?
And you don't have to say anything back.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.764
It's been a long time
since I have felt this happy.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.809
This feels so easy.
So I just wanna say thank you.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.312
Can we go back to the library?

12:10.896 --> 12:15.818
Baby, your glasses aren't ready yet.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.863
You wanna play a game?
We can play "I Spy."

12:18.946 --> 12:19.780
Okay.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.367
Uh, I spy with my little eye...

12:24.660 --> 12:28.080
something that begins with the letter M.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.416
-It's Mommy.
-Yeah.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.377
Good job, baby.

12:33.461 --> 12:39.383
[Joe] You're thinking what I am.
Is this the family we were destined for?

12:39.467 --> 12:40.593
[cell phone chimes]

12:44.805 --> 12:46.056
What's wrong?

12:46.140 --> 12:49.351
Um, it's... It's Ryan.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.687
He's giving me a heads-up

12:51.770 --> 12:55.399
that Channel Three is making
a sizable donation to the library

12:55.483 --> 12:58.652
and he will be at the fundraiser
to present the check.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.322
You don't think it's a coincidence?

13:01.405 --> 13:04.450
No, I mean, he's furious
that I'm reopening custody.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.160
It's a power move.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.746
He wants to show me
he can hurt me, even at my job.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.500
Do you think he's watching us?

13:12.583 --> 13:15.085
He feels ownership over me, okay?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.505
Sick as it is. And you stood up to him.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.049
So he's never gonna let that slide.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.552
So this, you and me, we can't.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.598
If Ryan finds out that I was
with a married man, however innocently,

13:28.682 --> 13:31.060
he'll use it and I'll never get custody.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.562
[Joe] You're right. Ryan is a problem,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.731
but there are always problems
in love stories.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.526
I'll find a way to solve this one,
for you.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.699
[Ryan] One time, I needed a fix so badly

13:45.783 --> 13:49.662
that I broke my molar
with a pair of pliers,

13:50.246 --> 13:52.164
knowing that they'd give me Oxy for it.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.544
That's where this disease took me.

13:56.627 --> 14:00.881
I couldn't wake up without Adderall.
I couldn't go to sleep without Oxy.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.216
[Joe] Interesting.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.886
Let me tell you what I've learned
about your ex, Ryan Goodwin.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.181
He's not a morning person.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.474
He wears tighty-whities.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.561
He's obsessed with protein shakes
and his workout regimen.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.731
It's like he's training
for the asshole Olympics.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.733
His mom, Harriet Goodwin,

14:20.526 --> 14:24.572
who's also his private chef,
maid and nanny, by the looks of it.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.824
It's not okay, Marienne.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.576
He's gaslit his way to full custody,

14:28.659 --> 14:31.579
when he doesn't even give
your daughter the time of day.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.124
He leaves Juliette to his mom

14:35.207 --> 14:38.460
while he works out with Wes,
his "best friend."

14:38.544 --> 14:41.505
Wes makes Ryan feel superior.
So that tracks.

14:41.589 --> 14:46.635
Ryan is technically sober.
But he's an emotional powder keg.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.096
He's transferred
his addiction to drugs and alcohol

14:49.179 --> 14:51.515
to an addiction to his body and status.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.934
Ryan's sobriety is hanging by a thread.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.187
You put a pebble into the machine
and wait for it to fail.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.237
Fuck. How many shakes does one man need?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.706

15:16.749 --> 15:17.958

15:19.209 --> 15:20.210
Where have you--?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.506
-Hey, you okay?
-Oh, I'm fine.

15:24.590 --> 15:29.428
Especially after how royally
your father fucked me in the arbitration,

15:29.511 --> 15:32.640
considering that I'm sober as a saint.

15:33.724 --> 15:37.686
One would expect the prenup
to fuck me out of Anavrin,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.105
despite the fact that I created it.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.108
It's the part where he found a way
to get around my lawyer

15:43.192 --> 15:47.780
and take my second-act vineyard,
my second act, for spite.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.281
I'm sorry.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.700
Sorry doesn't even cover it, Love.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.037
I did everything I was supposed to do.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.416
This is what happens
when you marry the wrong man.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.213
-Do you disagree?
-About Dad?

16:04.296 --> 16:08.008
No, he treated you horribly.
That's why I don't speak to him anymore.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.595
Then why are you being so quiet?

16:12.972 --> 16:13.889
I feel...

16:16.183 --> 16:17.101
sad.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.437
I know it's the right thing.
I'm glad that it's over.

16:20.521 --> 16:25.401
But it feels like a...
Like a kind of loss.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.570
You're right and it's sad.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.366
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.076
That's not what I'm saying.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.745
No, I should have known
the marriage was over two years in

16:36.829 --> 16:39.039
when your father stopped
wanting to do anal.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.833
I don't need the details.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.252
Don't be such a prude.
I'm doing you a service.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.045
You need to know what to look out for

16:45.129 --> 16:48.090
-in your own marriage.
-My marriage is nothing like yours.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.426
So you're not sleeping
with the neighbor's son?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.094
I'm not discussing this with you.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.139
Mom!

16:56.098 --> 16:57.057
It's enough.

Thanks, Theo. I'm hearing great things
about your work on the corporate side.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.281
I need you to help me sort it.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.784
I'm drowning in footage

18:48.752 --> 18:50.587
No, no, no. They'll never know.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.006
What you want will take a long time.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.093
Oh, I don't think it will,
not if you're involved.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.887
And I'm prepared to dramatically overpay.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.056
Plus, you'd be doing a service

I don't need to define myself
by something so arbitrary as a number.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.997
Okay.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.999
Don't worry, this isn't a sting.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.170
So, FYI, I do this as a service,
someone's gonna deal,

19:31.253 --> 19:33.380

of medicating the public,

and Oxycontin at night

20:17.132 --> 20:19.593
to reintroduce small amounts
into his system.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.138
All in an effort to fire
his neurotransmitters

20:23.222 --> 20:26.892
that are predisposed towards addiction,
thus inciting the phenomenon of craving.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.395
If the combo of cravings
and emotional dysregulation

20:30.479 --> 20:31.939
don't trigger a relapse,

20:33.065 --> 20:35.651
then disrupting his morning routine will.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.737
He'll be off the beam

26:41.766 --> 26:45.020
It's the magic of my love for you.
No, they opened in Berkeley.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.939
So I paid a kid to stand in line
and courier them over here.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.734
The look on your face
when you bite into one of those...

26:51.568 --> 26:53.570
Doughnuts aren't objectively sexy,

26:53.653 --> 26:56.323
but you make them
the hottest thing on Earth.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.289
Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.206
I...

27:08.918 --> 27:11.713
I thought
you didn't find me attractive anymore.

27:11.796 --> 27:15.342
[Joe] Fuck. I've been so single-minded
in my pursuit of you.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.930
Tonight my focus will be on Love.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.850
It has to be,
because if Love is not happy,

27:23.933 --> 27:25.602
we will never get the chance to be.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.895
You know, I...

27:28.480 --> 27:32.317
My mom was just in my head.
Their marriage was so toxic.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.653
Yeah. No, I guess, it's understandable.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.072
But we are not them.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.784
Yeah. Yeah.

27:41.534 --> 27:42.619
[cell phone ringing]

27:45.997 --> 27:47.624
Oh, this is her.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.085
Um, I should get this.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.753
-You should go get changed.
-Yeah.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.046
Okay.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.302
-Hey, hey, Mom.
-I know I'm late.

27:59.386 --> 28:03.932
I just took a little siesta and forgot
to set an alarm. I'll be there soon.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.184
What are you talking about?

28:06.267 --> 28:09.062
Don't you need me to watch Forty
while you're at the fundraiser?

28:09.145 --> 28:12.190
Oh. No, we got a sitter.
You just take care of you.

28:12.273 --> 28:15.735
So now I'm not good enough
to watch Forty? Is that it?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.445
-Have you been drinking?
-What?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.198
-I need to see Forty.
-You're drunk.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.658
I am not.

28:21.741 --> 28:24.202
You're just mad at me
for bringing up the neighbor boy.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.871
-Okay. I have to go.
-You're keeping my baby from me.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.998
-Don't drive.
-Please let me see Forty.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.627
-I can't deal with you right now.
-He's all I have left.

28:34.629 --> 28:35.797
Little bitch!

28:37.966 --> 28:39.134
Little bitch.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.227
Sweetie, can you help me
set this table up?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.562
No mat.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.814
[Joe] When the guests arrive,
it'll be packed in here.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.525
That'll keep you
and Love apart, right? Shit.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.486
Love is not stupid. This could be bad.
Why did I agree to this?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.572
Okay. Okay, I need a plan.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.366
I need to keep Love
as preoccupied as possible.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.284
Great. Bye.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.245
[Joe] Gotta hand it to you, Marienne,
you have outdone yourself.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.875
You think I should just check in on them?

29:11.958 --> 29:14.461
I'm just being neurotic, actually.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.130
[Joe] Always. But is it too much
to hope she stays back there

29:17.213 --> 29:19.257
-and you two never meet?
-Whatever you think.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.554
There you are.

29:24.637 --> 29:25.889
Undeniably you.

29:25.972 --> 29:31.144
Original, haunting, real,
never mind Alice and the Queen.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.813
You're the red rose herself.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.733
Yeah, I'm just being neurotic.
Thank you so much.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.284
I was looking for you.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.786
-Big problem.
-Yeah.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.872
I forgot to note everyone's
food intolerances on the seating chart.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.624
-Can you--?
-Yeah, of course.

29:52.707 --> 29:53.708
Okay. Um...

29:54.584 --> 29:55.502
You, come!

29:55.585 --> 29:57.212
-We can do this fast.
-Okay.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.176
[Joe] And just like that,
our fairy tale turns dark.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.303
I should make a disaster
in the kitchen truck,

30:05.386 --> 30:09.432
turn up the oven, scorch the quail,
but it's too late.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.314
It's like I'm watching my own execution.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.482
[Cary] My man!

30:19.150 --> 30:22.904
-Things work out with Taschen?
-It was great. Yeah. Thank you.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.240
Better than great, actually,
no sign of Ryan means

30:25.323 --> 30:28.034
he's probably in hour eight
of a drug binge with his buddy.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.954
[stammers] Baby, baby.

30:35.625 --> 30:39.003
I'm sorry, you must be Love. I'm Marienne.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.755
Joe's told me so much about you.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.382
-You're Joe's boss?
-Mm-hm.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.677
-It's so great to meet you.
-You as well.

30:47.136 --> 30:50.682
He's probably told you
how much of a taskmaster I am.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.308
No, I wouldn't say that.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.853
It's true. I do have exacting standards,

30:54.936 --> 30:58.022
which is probably a euphemism
for being a bossy pain in the ass.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.691
No, no, he really...

31:00.650 --> 31:02.360
He really loves working here.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.154
Good.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.031
Even if there's late shifts.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.159
Yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a gem.

31:10.243 --> 31:14.372
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up and...

31:15.164 --> 31:15.999
I'm, um...

31:16.958 --> 31:18.626
I'm seeing someone.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.754
We're in that "hang out
as much as possible" phase,

31:21.838 --> 31:23.923
so Joe's been picking up my slack.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.551
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:26.634 --> 31:30.013
That's so sweet.
Yeah, no, he doesn't seem to mind at all.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.223
Oh, that's very good to know.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.769
[Joe] Whatever you're saying
seems to be working for now.

31:38.271 --> 31:42.567
Hey, hey, heads up.
Fifty grand coming through.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.404
[Joe] What the fuck?
He should be out of his mind.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.323
How is he even standing right now?

31:49.032 --> 31:49.866
Here we go.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.993
-Not a fan?
-He's my ex.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.664
Hello. You both look lovely.
What should I do with this?

31:57.498 --> 31:59.751
Don't want it out
before the big unveiling.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.294
Let me show you.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.129
Excuse us.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.343
Hey, Dante.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.264
That guy is the fucking worst.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.350
[Joe] Oh, Dante,
one cannot even begin to fathom.

32:15.433 --> 32:19.145
He seems smug, I suppose.
But recovery can't be easy.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.773
Recovery? That prick's never been sober.

32:22.440 --> 32:27.320
His AA stuff is all for show.
There's drugs in his protein shake.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.113
-Like, today?
-Always.

32:29.197 --> 32:33.493
I took a sip on accident once.
I got so tweaked, I couldn't sleep.

32:33.576 --> 32:37.121
And then I realized,
he pounds that stuff all day. Every day.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.790
[Joe] I have been played.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.751
I couldn't dose Ryan

32:41.834 --> 32:43.962
because he's been dosing himself
the whole time

32:44.045 --> 32:46.798
and his tolerance is through the roof.
How did I miss this?

32:46.881 --> 32:49.342
Dante! How's it hanging, buddy?

32:49.425 --> 32:52.679
So much better now that you're here.
Will you excuse me?

32:54.764 --> 32:57.600
Joe Goldberg, right? I'm Ryan Goodwin.

32:57.684 --> 33:01.354
We met the other night
when I wasn't being my best self.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.856
That's right. It's good to re-meet you.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.775
You fucking cockroach.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.694
Oh! Fuck!

33:08.444 --> 33:10.738
That's meat. Where are you from?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.198
-New York.
-The city?

33:12.281 --> 33:13.783
Brooklyn.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.035
-How's the wine?
-It's okay, I guess.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.414
You know, it's interesting.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.167
I've seen you,
lurking in the back of meetings,

33:23.251 --> 33:24.752
pretending like you're invisible.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.796
But given the way
you're nursing that drink,

33:26.879 --> 33:29.799
you don't strike me as someone
who has a drinking problem.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.801
[Joe] Fuck, how much of me did he see?

33:31.884 --> 33:33.094
You gotta try this.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.015
It is, like, Iberian or some shit.
Yeah, give it a taste. Come on.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.850
Come on, taste.

33:39.976 --> 33:43.146
[Joe] What is this?
A sociopath's power play?

33:46.983 --> 33:52.238
I don't know what you're up to,
but I bet my dick, it's about Marienne.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.907
Stay away from her.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.079
Enjoy the party.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.293
[Joe] I lost this round,
but this isn't over.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.211
Not when you are at stake.

34:12.675 --> 34:17.096
This looks amazing. Unh!

34:18.473 --> 34:20.683
I am so good.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.978
Unh. I knew you'd do me right.

34:24.062 --> 34:24.896
Thanks.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.651
I can't wait any longer. This is torture.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.237
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.114
What?

34:35.198 --> 34:37.950
Didn't you read the post I sent you?

34:38.534 --> 34:40.995
Yeah, that really spun me out, Sherry.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.040
The biological importance
of making your man feel like a man?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.249
I...

34:45.333 --> 34:49.212
I just don't think
I'm one of these hot wives.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.129
Oh.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.634
You should've kept reading.

34:55.843 --> 34:56.677
Okay...

34:57.637 --> 35:01.599
Hot Wife is a term...

35:01.682 --> 35:02.809
Right.

35:02.892 --> 35:07.271
...for women in open marriages.

35:08.773 --> 35:12.193
Like me. Cary and I are polyamorous.

35:12.276 --> 35:16.614
Love, please, tell me you got the part
where I sent you a post I wrote.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.409
As in, that's my secret sex blog.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.288
Oh, I do not think
that I picked up on that.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.959
Well, now you know.

35:30.002 --> 35:33.047
And the more time
we spend with you and Joe,

35:33.881 --> 35:38.344
well, we can't stop thinking
about the two of you.

35:42.515 --> 35:46.144
We would love...

35:49.981 --> 35:55.236
to take our relationship to a new level.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.078
Would you be game?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.461
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.964
Sorry, it's my babysitter.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.342
What the fuck?

36:26.225 --> 36:27.894
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.275
[cell phone ringing]

36:37.320 --> 36:39.739
Let's hang up on your mother.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.616
We don't need to speak to her.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.285
Thank you.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.955
Stephanie, what a pretty name.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.251
Oh, don't worry, he's not a baby.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.797
No, no, he's the reincarnation
of my son, Forty,

36:56.881 --> 36:58.674
and he loves a good taco.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.343
Don't you, baby? Yes.

37:00.426 --> 37:04.013
My daughter's trying to keep him from me.
She's selfish like her father.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.182
I think we're missing
a couple of "gordatas."

37:06.265 --> 37:07.266
Uh--

37:07.350 --> 37:10.394
-They're coming right out.
-Bless you, Persephone.

37:11.312 --> 37:14.273
-You're a good person, aren't you?
-I guess.

37:15.066 --> 37:19.153
I just want Love to understand
where I'm coming from,

37:19.237 --> 37:21.489
but she refuses to listen.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.283
No one will listen.

37:26.869 --> 37:27.703
Except you.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.207
-[car horn honks]
-I'm getting my gordatas.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.917
Chrissake.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.919
No, I need my power back.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.839
I need justice. I need karmic retribution.

37:40.466 --> 37:44.553
-Do you want hot sauce?
-I want all the hot sauce and a lighter.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.430
Excuse me?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.307
I'll give you...

37:49.350 --> 37:51.727
300 dollars for a lighter.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.491
Thank you for listening.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.079
Let's go.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.748
[rock music playing over speakers]

38:17.962 --> 38:19.297
[sirens wailing]

38:24.510 --> 38:25.511
Oh, yeah.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.056
The bastard wanted the vineyard.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.479
-[Henry crying]
-Oh, oh!

38:35.563 --> 38:38.441
Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.947
[Joe] Note to self,
if you take a baby on a drunk joyride

38:45.031 --> 38:48.117
to go burn down a vineyard,
make sure you're a rich, white lady

38:48.200 --> 38:50.786
whose lawyer can get you
in a fancy rehab instead of jail.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.165
-Thank you for--
-What the fuck were you thinking?

38:54.248 --> 38:57.209
Just put him to bed, okay? I've got this.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.435
You can sleep here tonight.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.146
Tomorrow, Joe will drive you to rehab.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.273
You'll never see me.

39:20.816 --> 39:23.194
And you will never see Henry ever again.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.864
-You don't mean that.
-I do. With every fiber of my being.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.659
Love, please. I made a mistake.
But I've been punished--

39:30.743 --> 39:32.495
You could have killed him!

39:34.914 --> 39:36.582
You had your family...

39:37.500 --> 39:39.251
and look what you did.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.672
You let your husband destroy
your self-worth.

39:44.465 --> 39:48.469
You neglected your children.
You didn't protect Forty. I did that.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.762
Oh, that's rich.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.598
You liked him broken

39:52.681 --> 39:54.850
-'cause it gave you purpose.
-Maybe.

39:56.519 --> 40:00.064
But I have a new purpose now
and that's protecting my family.

40:01.107 --> 40:04.276
-From you. [laughs]
-How can you say that? I'm your mother.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.407
Having no mother would be better.

40:15.079 --> 40:19.500
You think you're so much better than me?
You're just me 20 years ago.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.295
One day, you will lose everything too.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.006
And then you'll see
how cruel you really are.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.642
Oh. Hey.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.520
Did you get it done? Whatever it is.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.605
Yep, just finished up.

40:42.314 --> 40:44.442
So, what were you doing?

40:44.525 --> 40:48.154
He totally passed out.
Think he really needs some rest.

40:52.825 --> 40:58.664
Look, it's none of my business,
but your dad is not okay.

41:00.833 --> 41:01.917
He needs help.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.420
I'll let myself out.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.926
[door opens, then closes]

41:12.428 --> 41:13.888
["Numb" playing]

42:04.271 --> 42:09.735
[Joe] I should be in bed with you,
tracing and drawing on your arm.

42:09.818 --> 42:14.949
Instead, I'm driving an Uber
shuttling Medusa-in-law to rehab.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.577
Bet you're happy
you won't have to see me anymore.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.415
I always thought
we had a good relationship.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.464
I have something to tell you, Joe.

42:31.840 --> 42:36.053
I see how hard you're trying
to make your marriage work, just like me.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.931
I did everything
to keep my family together,

42:39.014 --> 42:42.101
including lying to myself
about who my husband was...

42:42.768 --> 42:44.144
and who my daughter is.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.398
[Joe] Is this where Dottie tries
to poison me against Love?

42:47.481 --> 42:49.233
Her final act of revenge?

42:49.316 --> 42:51.777
How much do you know
about Love's first husband, James?

42:53.028 --> 42:53.904
Um...

42:54.321 --> 42:58.284
I know they were in love. Married young.

42:58.951 --> 43:01.328
He got cancer and then he died.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.289
Not quite.

43:04.665 --> 43:07.835
When James became ill,
he and Love were already having problems.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.337
After he went into remission,

43:10.421 --> 43:11.797
he asked for a divorce.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.342
And the next thing you know, he was dead.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.344
[Joe] Surely, she's not suggesting...

43:17.428 --> 43:20.764
I have no proof, of course.
Just a mother's intuition.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.392
You probably think I'm crazy.

43:23.475 --> 43:28.355
[Joe] I might, if I hadn't seen
what Love is capable of, many times.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.940
This must be hard.

43:30.566 --> 43:31.775
You're loyal.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.111
That's what makes you a good husband.

43:35.237 --> 43:39.408
But Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

43:40.826 --> 43:44.788
If anything were to happen to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.589
Like a young Gregory Peck.

43:55.591 --> 43:58.052
[Joe]
Could Love have killed her first husband?

43:58.844 --> 44:03.349
I've been so worried about her hurting you
that I failed to remember:

44:03.432 --> 44:05.309
I am also fair game.

44:17.363 --> 44:21.533
[Joe] But we should be together, Marienne.
I will find a way.

44:21.617 --> 44:25.663
It's risky, but love requires
a hint of madness.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.457
We're all mad here, right, red rose?

44:28.540 --> 44:29.917
-Hey.
-Hey.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.877
-Is everything okay?
-No.

44:38.884 --> 44:41.804
Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.806
He's threatening to use it against me.

44:43.889 --> 44:46.517
What? We're just colleagues.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.061
We're not. And you know that.

44:49.144 --> 44:50.938
And besides, it doesn't matter

44:51.021 --> 44:53.941
because Ryan will make it look
as bad as possible.

44:54.024 --> 44:56.777
[Joe] Fucking Ryan. I'll destroy him.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.612
-We can fix this.
-We?

44:59.822 --> 45:02.157
What are you talking about?
You're married.

45:02.241 --> 45:05.869
Your marriage doesn't seem strained.
Your wife is lovely.

45:05.953 --> 45:09.623
[Joe] Lovely, yes. With a mild habit
of murdering women I care about.

45:09.706 --> 45:12.000
I hated having to lie to her.

45:13.168 --> 45:16.171
I slid into old patterns
and I feel disgusted.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.214
I...

45:18.090 --> 45:19.883
It's not good for my recovery.

45:19.967 --> 45:23.929
I'm at a point where I'm supposed to live
with integrity. I can't be a home-wrecker.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.056
Of course not.

45:27.307 --> 45:29.226
But there has to be another way.

45:29.309 --> 45:30.352
There isn't.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.355
Hey.

45:34.606 --> 45:36.859
I care about you. I do.

45:38.485 --> 45:40.779
And, yeah, there's chemistry.

45:40.863 --> 45:41.697
[Joe] But...

45:41.780 --> 45:43.991
But, no, I have to think of Juliette.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.619
And I promised myself,
my next relationship would be...

45:48.620 --> 45:50.706
Would be aboveboard and honest.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.001
I'm sorry.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.798
[Joe] Aboveboard and honest.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.842
How do I give that to you?

46:10.726 --> 46:11.768
You good?

46:12.853 --> 46:15.189
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-- I'm tired.

46:16.398 --> 46:18.650
Can I get your opinion on something?

46:18.734 --> 46:19.693
Yeah, of course.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.365
-What do you think about this?
-What is this?

46:26.158 --> 46:29.244
Sherry sent it.
It's from her secret sex blog.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.581
-Sherry and Cary are in an open marriage.
-Hmm.

46:33.582 --> 46:37.377
And... they wanna sleep with us.

46:42.424 --> 46:44.426
Yeah, I thought it was a joke too.

46:44.510 --> 46:47.179
So--? So why are you showing me this?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.809
As a joke, obviously.

46:52.893 --> 46:53.810
Oh.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.148
You don't really look at me the same.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.484
You don't seem interested
in having sex with me.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.945
That's not true.
People go through rough patches.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.613
I don't wanna become...

47:06.073 --> 47:07.115
like my parents.

47:07.699 --> 47:11.370
They couldn't stay in love.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.498
Maybe we need to shake things up.

47:15.999 --> 47:18.585
It sounds crazy, but I read that article.

47:18.669 --> 47:19.795
[Joe] Opening our marriage.

47:19.878 --> 47:21.880
This loophole cannot be falling
into my lap.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.341
I don't even know how I feel about it.

47:24.424 --> 47:28.220
Sherry just said it was the greatest hack,

47:28.303 --> 47:31.014
and I guess...

47:32.057 --> 47:34.851
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.937
[Joe] I'd rather take
a chain saw to my thigh,

47:37.020 --> 47:38.438
but hopefully, that's negotiable.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.440
Sorry, I'm just being stupid.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.235
Love, Love, stop, stop, stop backpedaling.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.822
You can come to me with anything.

47:46.905 --> 47:49.575
That's what this marriage is, right?

47:50.158 --> 47:54.121
No idea is too crazy?
We talk things through, right?

47:55.247 --> 47:57.583
And we make decisions together.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.171
I love you.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.971
[Joe] And I love you.

48:19.187 --> 48:20.272
[door locks]

48:26.820 --> 48:29.740
