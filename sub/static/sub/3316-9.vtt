WEBVTT

00:02.368 --> 00:05.012
Please, have a seat, Mr. Morgan.

00:05.368 --> 00:07.007
Do you mind if I call you John?

00:07.591 --> 00:08.633
Johnny.

00:09.293 --> 00:11.612
And how did you come
to find me, Johnny?

00:11.900 --> 00:14.052
I saw your ad in one
of those m-magazines

00:14.194 --> 00:16.448
they have in the mail,
the <i>Penny Saver.</i>

00:16.587 --> 00:19.349
You probably saw
my smoking cessation ad.

00:19.461 --> 00:21.670
"Guaranteed results
or your money back"?

00:21.787 --> 00:23.250
I don't smoke.

00:23.348 --> 00:25.040
Well, you certainly don't look

00:25.173 --> 00:26.936
like you need
to lose any weight.

00:27.125 --> 00:29.132
Your ad said something about...

00:29.436 --> 00:31.124
curbing compulsions.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.283
Absolutely.

00:32.396 --> 00:34.650
I've found posthypnotic
suggestion to be

00:34.773 --> 00:38.371
one of the most powerful weapons
in a therapist's arsenal.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.231
I want to stop.
I really do.

00:41.332 --> 00:45.135
If I have to go on medication,
whatever, I'm willing to try.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.980
Tell me about the behavior
you want to curtail.

00:48.097 --> 00:50.582
- Start from the beginning.
- I always, uh,

00:50.781 --> 00:53.848
had these impulses,
you know, even as a kid.

00:53.952 --> 00:55.417
The first time I tried it,

00:55.537 --> 00:56.958
it was scary.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.822
But it felt amazing.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.669
My whole body came alive.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.009
When my foster family
saw the evidence...

01:03.506 --> 01:04.583
they kicked me out.

01:04.703 --> 01:05.991
I bounced from house to house

01:06.122 --> 01:08.294
until I learned how to hide it.

01:08.422 --> 01:11.182
It's a shame so many people
have such a negative reaction

01:11.318 --> 01:13.098
to something so natural.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.625
Was that the first time
you touched yourself?

01:15.763 --> 01:17.063
No.

01:17.475 --> 01:19.344
I skinned a cat.

01:20.518 --> 01:23.103
- It was already dead.
- So...

01:23.385 --> 01:25.935
you went around
finding dead animals?

01:26.071 --> 01:28.051
Yeah. First couple of times.

01:28.157 --> 01:32.616
Then I learned that killing them
was just as good.

01:32.735 --> 01:34.145
Even better.

01:34.936 --> 01:37.327
And this compulsion followed you

01:37.451 --> 01:38.915
into your adult life?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.965
No. I don't harm
animals anymore.

01:41.095 --> 01:43.596
I haven't since
I was a teenager.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.890
Did you know that
killing animals

01:46.020 --> 01:48.867
is a predictor for psychopaths?

01:49.005 --> 01:50.235
I learned that in prison.

01:50.332 --> 01:51.673
Armed robbery.

01:51.791 --> 01:53.439
But it got me thinking.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.869
What made me... the way I am?

01:56.976 --> 01:59.106
Who were my <i>real</i> parents?

01:59.234 --> 02:01.558
Well, they had a computer at the
joint, and I didn't have nothing

02:01.694 --> 02:03.744
- but time, so...
- Mr. Morgan, you know,

02:03.877 --> 02:06.032
I-I may not be qualified
to help you.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.354
No, you <i>have</i> to help, Doctor.

02:08.473 --> 02:11.203
I don't know what to do,
because those thoughts...

02:11.356 --> 02:12.711
haven't stopped.

02:12.832 --> 02:13.514
If anything,

02:13.657 --> 02:15.517
they've gotten harder to ignore

02:15.638 --> 02:17.853
since I found out who I am.

02:18.313 --> 02:20.887
And what do those thoughts
tell you to do?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.985
They told me to
retrace my roots,

02:23.107 --> 02:25.759
so I'm renting the house
where my father lived.

02:26.137 --> 02:28.639
They also told me to hurt women.

02:29.428 --> 02:31.361
But not just hurt them.

02:32.117 --> 02:33.584
Skin them.

02:34.103 --> 02:35.492
Like the cats.

02:37.062 --> 02:38.523
Stop moving!

02:40.432 --> 02:41.385
Shut up!

02:41.509 --> 02:44.065
This is delicate work.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.246
I didn't have the same skills
as my father.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.977
I didn't get the
medical training.

02:49.096 --> 02:50.755
I made a mess.

02:52.698 --> 02:54.177
You think it's too late?

02:54.291 --> 02:56.402
It's never too late
to turn yourself in.

02:56.539 --> 02:58.210
No, to go to medical school.

02:58.323 --> 03:00.040
I'll never live up to him.

03:00.159 --> 03:02.171
That's why I wanted to stop.

03:03.298 --> 03:04.389
You see,

03:04.502 --> 03:07.213
my name isn't Morgan.

03:07.381 --> 03:09.251
It's Thredson.

03:10.639 --> 03:12.618
I'm the son of Bloody Face.

04:22.893 --> 04:25.079
You wanted a word
with Miss Winters?

04:27.420 --> 04:29.447
What did I tell you
about knocking?

04:29.566 --> 04:31.553
Oh, it won't happen
again, Sister.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.105
Have a seat.

04:37.390 --> 04:39.204
Your Jude imitation
is spot-on.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.582
For a moment there,

04:40.735 --> 04:42.849
- I thought you might cane her.
- Mm-hmm.

04:42.954 --> 04:45.831
Awfully sassy for a
girl in your condition.

04:45.913 --> 04:47.530
What condition is that?

04:47.828 --> 04:50.819
Well... the good news is,

04:50.961 --> 04:53.351
you seem to have conquered
your sexual perversion.

04:53.473 --> 04:55.013
The bad news is...

04:55.910 --> 04:57.737
the rabbit died.

04:58.047 --> 04:58.756
If I were

04:58.926 --> 05:00.818
my Aunt Celeste,
I would offer you

05:00.995 --> 05:02.836
a Drano margarita.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.336
- A what?
- You add half a cup of Drano

05:05.471 --> 05:07.277
for every two weeks
you've been pregnant

05:07.407 --> 05:08.567
to a margarita.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.273
That's what she gave
my slutty cousin Molly

05:10.384 --> 05:13.594
when she got preggers
by Billy Porter.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.676
- I'm pregnant?
- So are we still sticking

05:16.803 --> 05:18.325
to the whole rapist story?

05:18.465 --> 05:21.376
Interesting you haven't
mentioned Dr. Thredson once

05:21.504 --> 05:23.995
since you came in here.
We starting to get

05:24.104 --> 05:26.266
sweet on him now that
we're carrying his child?

05:29.193 --> 05:29.888
Actually,

05:30.055 --> 05:31.828
the whole... rape thing
must have been

05:31.964 --> 05:33.720
some kind of hallucination
from the car crash

05:33.859 --> 05:36.259
when I... I hit my head.

05:36.415 --> 05:37.675
Well...

05:37.804 --> 05:39.551
whoever the daddy is...

05:39.728 --> 05:40.982
there's a little life growing

05:41.119 --> 05:42.434
inside of you.

05:42.578 --> 05:44.361
I can't keep this baby.

05:44.579 --> 05:46.401
I can't have this baby
inside me.

05:46.538 --> 05:48.131
You <i>can</i> have this baby,

05:48.252 --> 05:50.222
and you <i>will</i> have this baby.

05:52.087 --> 05:53.686
This is an insane asylum.

05:53.826 --> 05:55.536
People hump like bunnies here.

05:55.661 --> 05:56.973
You're hardly our first...

05:57.264 --> 05:58.336
unwed mother.

05:58.475 --> 06:00.392
Most of the babies, they
are born a little...

06:00.531 --> 06:01.736
cuckoo.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.050
So... our staff is
very experienced

06:04.170 --> 06:05.818
at calming them and...

06:05.931 --> 06:07.910
preparing them for
relocation to St. Ursula's

06:08.046 --> 06:09.910
Home for Lost Children.

06:10.038 --> 06:11.705
You're worse than Jude.

06:11.827 --> 06:12.768
You're a sadist.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.125
Calm down, Mommy,

06:14.242 --> 06:16.990
or it's going to be a
very long nine months.

06:17.118 --> 06:20.230
We don't want to have
to restrain you... do we?

06:27.318 --> 06:28.788
May I go?

06:28.961 --> 06:30.217
Of course.

06:44.042 --> 06:45.738
You're awake.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.337
I'm so relieved.

06:47.464 --> 06:49.519
Oh, Monsignor.

06:52.357 --> 06:54.777
No, no, no, you mustn't move.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.669
You've been injured, I'm afraid.

06:56.788 --> 06:57.709
Shh...

06:57.884 --> 06:59.155
What happened?

06:59.261 --> 07:00.864
You don't remember?

07:03.433 --> 07:04.756
<i>You killed a man.</i>

07:04.914 --> 07:07.053
- God rest his soul.
- I had no choice.

07:07.199 --> 07:08.589
I was defending myself.

07:08.715 --> 07:11.183
He tried to murder me,
and worse.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.108
You've become unhinged;
that's clear.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.800
I blame myself.

07:14.952 --> 07:16.329
I should have seen it sooner.

07:16.474 --> 07:17.903
- What?
- The pressures of running

07:18.033 --> 07:20.717
- this place were too much for you.
- No!

07:20.914 --> 07:24.852
You've grown paranoid,
seeking conspiracy.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.120
And now Frank McCann is dead.

07:27.702 --> 07:28.946
What did you say?

07:29.054 --> 07:30.255
Kindly speak up.

07:30.821 --> 07:33.380
I saw the nun, Sister Jude,

07:33.512 --> 07:35.408
<i>attack Frank McCann.</i>

07:36.038 --> 07:37.296
It was horrible.

07:37.405 --> 07:38.518
And then what happened?

07:38.657 --> 07:41.243
I made sure the other
inmates were secure,

07:41.536 --> 07:44.273
and then alerted Dr. Arden
to the situation.

07:44.395 --> 07:47.152
- Why didn't you call the police?
- There wasn't time.

07:47.527 --> 07:48.998
It was...

07:49.334 --> 07:51.784
if you'll pardon
the expression, bedlam.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.419
Sister Jude was on a rampage.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.148
She'd already killed
Frank McCann,

07:55.531 --> 07:57.181
taken Leigh Emerson hostage,

07:57.311 --> 07:59.245
and locked herself
in her old office.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.545
I can't say any of this
came as a surprise to me.

08:02.664 --> 08:04.502
She'd been showing
signs of instability

08:04.633 --> 08:05.899
for some time.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.700
She seemed to be
taking on the delusions

08:08.838 --> 08:10.234
of some of the patients here.

08:10.366 --> 08:13.090
She accused Dr. Arden
of being a Nazi.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.679
She came to me... convinced
that her young protégé,

08:16.820 --> 08:20.013
Sister Mary Eunice,
was possessed by the Devil.

08:20.149 --> 08:22.061
When I informed her
I would be removing her

08:22.189 --> 08:23.382
from her position here,

08:23.528 --> 08:24.920
she became inconsolable.

08:25.064 --> 08:26.504
She threatened me with the same

08:26.634 --> 08:29.109
straight-edge razor that
she used to murder Frank McCann.

08:29.235 --> 08:31.947
She smelled of liquor
and... cigarettes.

08:32.077 --> 08:33.359
We had her escorted
off the property.

08:33.496 --> 08:35.754
I-I-I should have called
the police then-- I just...

08:35.900 --> 08:38.630
I never for a moment thought
something like this could happen.

08:38.741 --> 08:39.991
I saw her do it.

08:40.134 --> 08:42.171
I saw Sister Jude...

08:43.086 --> 08:45.581
murder Frank McCann
in cold blood and then try

08:45.719 --> 08:47.392
- to do the same to me.
- Isn't it true

08:47.534 --> 08:48.983
that you yourself
are responsible

08:49.154 --> 08:50.850
for the deaths of 18 people?

08:50.984 --> 08:54.395
Well, sir, the state...
found me <i>not</i> responsible,

08:54.536 --> 08:56.345
which is why they
put me in here, but...

08:56.470 --> 08:57.787
yes...

08:59.229 --> 09:03.017
oh, yes, I am responsible,
I know that now. I've...

09:04.241 --> 09:07.577
I've had time to reflect
upon my crimes...

09:07.829 --> 09:08.780
Your Honor.

09:08.925 --> 09:12.093
Christmas '62 was
a very bad time for me,

09:12.267 --> 09:15.264
and the only solace I have
is knowing that...

09:15.757 --> 09:17.970
because of what I did...

09:18.531 --> 09:20.857
there are 18 more people
in Heaven.

09:20.985 --> 09:22.455
That's a unique perspective,

09:22.567 --> 09:24.486
- Mr. Emerson.
- W-Well, I do know, sir,

09:24.644 --> 09:28.377
that no matter what,
I-I can't... hate Sister Jude

09:28.510 --> 09:30.863
for what she did to me--
but I <i>can...</i>

09:31.139 --> 09:32.557
try to forgive her,

09:32.711 --> 09:34.398
and I can carry on

09:34.532 --> 09:38.135
on my own personal road
to true redemption,

09:38.256 --> 09:39.639
so that one day,

09:39.788 --> 09:41.626
when I enter
the gates of Heaven...

09:41.964 --> 09:43.886
I can apologize,

09:44.037 --> 09:45.577
personally, to each of those

09:45.713 --> 09:48.663
18 people that
I sent there before me.

09:51.764 --> 09:54.158
The court magistrate is
determined that you will live out

09:54.295 --> 09:55.529
the remainder of your days

09:55.690 --> 09:57.313
here at Briarcliff.

09:57.511 --> 09:58.764
You will, of course, be stripped

09:58.888 --> 10:00.516
of your clerical standing.

10:01.519 --> 10:04.643
No longer will you be a sister
of the Holy Catholic Church.

10:04.776 --> 10:07.848
You are once again
Miss Judy Martin.

10:08.057 --> 10:09.039
Patient.

10:09.178 --> 10:10.835
No, you can't do this to me!

10:10.956 --> 10:12.643
- You did it to yourself.
- Come back here,

10:12.775 --> 10:14.017
you son of a bitch!

10:14.149 --> 10:16.225
Come back here!

10:16.519 --> 10:17.692
It's a set-up!

10:17.812 --> 10:20.486
God, help me!

11:07.679 --> 11:10.341
Apparently she had
quite the secret inner life.

11:10.485 --> 11:13.982
Oh, Sister,
you... startled me.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.852
I'm just packing up her things

11:15.968 --> 11:18.220
so they can be donated
to the poor.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.521
I was as shocked as you are

11:19.643 --> 11:21.029
when I first saw this.

11:23.801 --> 11:27.374
I wonder who she was
fancying when she wore it.

11:27.657 --> 11:30.341
Of course, none of this
is of our concern.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.932
We had a dream together,
you know.

11:34.046 --> 11:34.959
She told me.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.081
She said you

11:36.201 --> 11:37.973
wanted to be Pope.

11:39.144 --> 11:39.976
Those

11:40.082 --> 11:41.542
things were said in confidence.

11:41.673 --> 11:43.686
You know what I said to her
when she told me your dream?

11:44.137 --> 11:50.613
I said, "Rome is
where that man belongs."

11:50.924 --> 11:52.899
She was so happy when you said

11:53.044 --> 11:54.940
you wanted her on
that journey with you.

11:55.066 --> 11:57.882
Like a girl who'd just received
a marriage proposal.

11:57.982 --> 11:59.257
I can't help but wonder,

11:59.387 --> 12:01.510
if I'd been paying closer
attention,

12:01.615 --> 12:03.501
could this tragedy
have been averted?

12:03.631 --> 12:04.934
Oh, Monsignor,

12:05.063 --> 12:06.941
as she herself would say,

12:07.895 --> 12:09.051
"No time

12:09.196 --> 12:10.829
for navel-gazing.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.542
Too much to be done."

12:13.658 --> 12:15.584
But you've had to focus
on your own goals.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.839
There is no other goal
than to save souls.

12:17.969 --> 12:19.388
She also said that.

12:19.503 --> 12:20.796
Of course.

12:21.077 --> 12:22.389
I know I, uh...

12:22.497 --> 12:25.408
I can't begin to fill
the shoes of the...

12:25.661 --> 12:27.006
Sister Jude we all knew

12:27.143 --> 12:28.285
and loved, but...

12:28.427 --> 12:29.691
let me say...

12:30.040 --> 12:31.588
I'm here to serve you.

12:31.808 --> 12:33.990
I want to help you save souls,

12:34.286 --> 12:37.066
all the way to Rome.

13:12.006 --> 13:14.635
Get away from me!
Get away from me! No!

13:14.757 --> 13:17.234
I demand to speak to someone!

13:17.339 --> 13:19.232
Now, now, Sister Jude.
You mustn't behave so.

13:19.347 --> 13:20.569
She's no Sister no more.

13:20.695 --> 13:22.532
She's no queen of
the castle neither.

13:22.639 --> 13:24.270
She's just a naughty patient.

13:24.401 --> 13:26.001
Now do as you're told
and take these pills.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.047
- No!
- Or I'll

13:27.141 --> 13:28.583
- happily force 'em down your gullet.
- No!

13:34.149 --> 13:35.290
You clip me again

13:35.510 --> 13:37.301
and I'll call Frank in here.

13:37.813 --> 13:38.916
Oh, but I can't,

13:39.029 --> 13:41.304
because you already
clipped Frank but good.

13:41.464 --> 13:42.234
No!

13:42.327 --> 13:44.473
That's a lie! Get off of me!
Get off of me!

13:44.590 --> 13:46.198
What's all this fuss then?

13:46.358 --> 13:48.099
Hmm? Hmm?
That's quite enough.

13:48.468 --> 13:51.478
Timothy. Please.

13:51.617 --> 13:53.357
Why don't you go and
find some other tasks

13:53.494 --> 13:54.946
- for the moment?
- Yes, Monsignor.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.131
Of course, Father.

13:56.244 --> 13:57.467
Timothy.

13:57.566 --> 13:58.797
Well, I was hoping you might be

13:58.908 --> 14:00.156
up for a visitor, but I

14:00.273 --> 14:02.771
see that our adjustment period
continues.

14:02.879 --> 14:04.733
No. No.

14:05.592 --> 14:07.723
Monsignor, please.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.560
Don't go.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.176
Are you sure?

14:11.602 --> 14:13.290
I'm better now.

14:22.085 --> 14:23.525
What's he doing here?

14:23.660 --> 14:25.184
Leigh...

14:25.313 --> 14:27.333
has something he would
like to say to you.

14:27.456 --> 14:28.911
And...

14:29.744 --> 14:32.375
I think you'll find
it more medicinal

14:32.823 --> 14:34.813
than any pill.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.590
Leigh?

14:53.304 --> 14:55.149
I forgive you.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.281
You forgive me?

14:57.416 --> 14:58.508
I do.

14:59.303 --> 15:00.991
Make it tight, Frank.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.835
Make it tight. I like it tight.

15:02.949 --> 15:04.447
Just ask Sister Chastity.

15:04.561 --> 15:05.785
I'll deal with Sister Chastity.

15:05.912 --> 15:08.694
You might start by picking
a new name for her.

15:12.252 --> 15:13.231
You know,

15:13.376 --> 15:15.156
I thought by allowing you time

15:15.281 --> 15:16.949
in the general population

15:17.075 --> 15:19.141
that it would have had
a civilizing effect on you,

15:19.248 --> 15:20.169
but clearly

15:20.291 --> 15:21.791
I was wrong,
Mr. Emerson.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.538
So you'll spend the next

15:23.657 --> 15:25.133
couple days here,

15:25.248 --> 15:26.809
reflecting on your behavior.

15:26.932 --> 15:29.869
How can I reflect
when my hand's tied down?

15:29.983 --> 15:31.009
You're disgusting.

15:31.148 --> 15:33.017
We all got our crosses to bear.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.187
Come on. Where's your spirit
of forgiveness?

15:35.307 --> 15:37.322
I reserve it for those
who are truly repentant.

15:37.439 --> 15:39.228
All God's chillun got to have
forgiveness--

15:39.370 --> 15:40.847
isn't that what
your church teaches you?

15:40.955 --> 15:43.836
I'm under no obligation
to forgive you.

15:43.964 --> 15:44.935
I'm no priest,

15:45.068 --> 15:46.718
and you are no penitent.

15:46.844 --> 15:49.100
I don't need your forgiveness.

15:50.647 --> 15:52.642
And therein lies

15:52.781 --> 15:55.547
the journey to true redemption.

15:55.669 --> 15:57.452
I hope for both of you.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.647
- It's me.
- What are you doing here?

16:32.274 --> 16:33.466
Shit. Did they find him?

16:33.583 --> 16:34.401
Not yet.

16:34.519 --> 16:35.596
Are you okay?
You look terrible.

16:35.730 --> 16:36.969
Kit...

16:38.257 --> 16:40.019
- we have to kill him.
- What?

16:40.149 --> 16:42.049
We should've done it
when we had the chance.

16:42.347 --> 16:43.407
They're gonna find him,

16:43.534 --> 16:44.718
and then he'll be free again,

16:44.853 --> 16:46.253
and we cannot wait
for that to happen.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.512
We're not going to. Lana,

16:48.648 --> 16:50.819
he's the only thing standing
between me and the death house.

16:50.935 --> 16:52.877
We have to get him to confess.

16:52.997 --> 16:54.387
You know what
sodium pentothal is?

16:54.499 --> 16:55.681
It's truth serum.

16:57.274 --> 16:59.398
Even if we could
get our hands on some,

16:59.604 --> 17:02.111
those confessions are deemed
inadmissible in court.

17:02.245 --> 17:03.468
It'll never fly.

17:03.582 --> 17:04.653
I'm desperate.

17:04.782 --> 17:06.255
Look, I don't know
why they haven't

17:06.359 --> 17:07.665
turned me in to the
state police yet.

17:07.781 --> 17:10.266
Maybe 'cause I've seen too
much here but either way,

17:10.416 --> 17:12.409
I need Thredson to talk.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.184
I think I might know how.

18:11.906 --> 18:13.741
You know how this goes.

18:14.044 --> 18:15.390
You make a sound,

18:15.521 --> 18:17.409
I bash your face in.

18:33.656 --> 18:36.613
You'd like to kill me right now,
Oliver, wouldn't you?

18:43.127 --> 18:45.079
This might change your mind.

18:45.935 --> 18:46.864
What is this?

18:46.974 --> 18:48.951
It's the ultimate cosmic joke.

18:50.211 --> 18:52.108
You got me pregnant.

18:53.103 --> 18:54.785
I'm gonna be a father?

18:54.928 --> 18:57.173
No, Oliver, you're not
gonna be a father.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.243
Not this time.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.968
What do you mean?
Oh, no.

19:02.129 --> 19:03.860
No, no. Lana, please,

19:04.001 --> 19:06.264
please, please don't
give him away.

19:06.737 --> 19:08.752
I know what it's like to be
raised in the system--

19:08.888 --> 19:10.238
- it ruins...
- Oliver, stop!

19:10.375 --> 19:12.066
This monster
you planted inside me,

19:12.188 --> 19:13.799
I'm getting rid of it.

19:13.990 --> 19:15.850
And since I'm stuck here,

19:15.998 --> 19:17.915
I'm gonna have to get creative.

19:18.678 --> 19:19.726
No.

19:20.163 --> 19:21.234
Lana, no, please.

19:21.359 --> 19:22.904
This is a mercy killing, Oliver.

19:23.111 --> 19:24.013
No baby

19:24.150 --> 19:25.000
should have to grow up

19:25.126 --> 19:26.501
knowing Daddy is Bloody Face.

19:26.628 --> 19:28.083
No. He'll never have to know.

19:28.229 --> 19:30.897
Kit Walker is gonna
take the fall for those crimes.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.099
I promise you,
it'll all work out.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.452
Is that how you see it?

19:38.002 --> 19:39.071
Lana...

19:39.196 --> 19:40.651
you know me, I can change.

19:40.775 --> 19:41.922
I have great determination

19:42.039 --> 19:44.143
- and now I have reason...
- Really?

19:44.740 --> 19:47.314
You gonna be
a real stand-up guy now?

19:47.434 --> 19:49.471
Yes. You owe me this.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.483
It's my child, too. Please.

19:52.612 --> 19:54.465
You're a sociopath.

19:55.075 --> 19:56.751
You can't be honest
with anybody.

19:56.869 --> 19:58.796
I can. I can be... honest.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.583
I can. Please help me.

20:08.591 --> 20:10.245
Okay.

20:12.386 --> 20:14.070
Donna Burton.

20:14.366 --> 20:16.319
Why did you choose her?

20:21.882 --> 20:23.986
I saw her...

20:24.481 --> 20:26.436
at the library
a couple of nights.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.360
What did you like about her?

20:31.076 --> 20:32.807
Her skin.

20:34.023 --> 20:36.306
It was fuzzy like a peach.

20:37.879 --> 20:39.858
And I wanted to feel it.

20:39.978 --> 20:42.121
So you skinned her alive.

20:45.315 --> 20:46.290
Yes.

20:46.401 --> 20:47.770
And Alison Reidel?

20:52.568 --> 20:57.072
She was a secretary
at my dentist's office.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.318
I always liked her.

21:01.006 --> 21:02.476
I put her to sleep first,

21:02.619 --> 21:05.288
but she kept talking to me.

21:06.716 --> 21:09.228
I was so confused.

21:10.388 --> 21:12.453
And what about Wendy?

21:16.581 --> 21:19.509
She never loved you.

21:20.574 --> 21:23.157
She locked you away.

21:26.058 --> 21:30.737
Her skin was fuzzy like
a peach, and I wanted to feel it.

21:30.858 --> 21:32.314
- So you skinned her alive.
- What?

21:32.442 --> 21:34.100
Hey.

21:35.719 --> 21:37.576
And Alison Reidel?

21:37.716 --> 21:39.768
- I think we got it.
- Hide that tape.

21:40.942 --> 21:42.512
I'm not finished here.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.525
Hey... bitch.

21:44.944 --> 21:46.471
So it was all an act, huh?

21:46.586 --> 21:47.896
- No.
- You were never pregnant?

21:48.021 --> 21:49.251
No, that part was true.

21:49.358 --> 21:51.187
Was. Sadly,

21:51.315 --> 21:54.799
your beloved baby died
last night.

21:59.054 --> 22:00.399
<i>It started as a trickle.</i>

22:00.501 --> 22:03.591
<i>Within an hour,</i>
<i>it was a bloody mess.</i>

22:06.880 --> 22:08.909
It really wasn't
that bad, actually.

22:09.029 --> 22:10.143
God, you're a monster.

22:10.264 --> 22:11.899
You are worse than I am.

22:12.028 --> 22:13.508
You killed an innocent child.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.454
I have bakery duty later.

22:17.732 --> 22:20.074
And after knife count,
I'm gonna pocket one,

22:20.206 --> 22:23.743
and I'm gonna come back and
slit your throat nice and easy.

22:24.571 --> 22:26.265
I always wanted
to know what it was like

22:26.341 --> 22:28.389
inside the mind of a killer.

22:29.835 --> 22:31.426
Now I know.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.452
Ah, Mr. Walker.

22:54.566 --> 22:56.363
I thought it might
be you. You really

22:56.482 --> 22:58.662
shouldn't be wandering around
these halls, you know.

22:58.793 --> 23:01.125
You're not even officially
part of this institution.

23:01.244 --> 23:03.699
However, I'm very glad
you're here. We have so much

23:03.836 --> 23:05.278
to talk about.

23:05.405 --> 23:08.226
<i>Après vous, monsieur.</i>

23:31.061 --> 23:33.711
I always keep a bottle of
18-year-old single malt

23:33.850 --> 23:35.397
in my desk...

23:36.685 --> 23:39.480
for special
occasions like this.

23:42.410 --> 23:46.294
I think you'll find this
exceptionally smooth.

23:56.897 --> 23:58.200
What are you doing?

23:58.325 --> 23:59.857
I'm just trying
to being friendly.

24:00.252 --> 24:01.354
Why?

24:04.066 --> 24:06.548
Because I've seen
what you've seen.

24:10.738 --> 24:11.891
They were here.

24:12.005 --> 24:13.326
The creatures you
told me about.

24:13.465 --> 24:14.882
The little green men,

24:15.015 --> 24:16.888
except of course,
they're not green,

24:16.999 --> 24:18.321
are they, Mr. Walker?

24:18.435 --> 24:20.978
No. They're obviously
a great deal more powerful

24:21.110 --> 24:23.482
and technologically advanced
than we are.

24:23.607 --> 24:24.701
They're terrifying.

24:24.818 --> 24:27.592
Mm-hmm. They took Grace.

24:27.681 --> 24:30.540
They took her body while I
was trying to dispose of it.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.407
What would they...
what would they want with her?

24:32.556 --> 24:34.592
That's what
I've been asking myself.

24:34.928 --> 24:36.607
Tell me, Mr. Walker.

24:36.729 --> 24:40.170
Did you have sex with your wife
just before she was taken?

24:44.668 --> 24:46.107
I've almost forgotten her.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.502
I'll take that
as a yes. You also

24:48.634 --> 24:50.462
had relations with our Grace,

24:50.692 --> 24:54.657
which is why Sister Jude wanted
me to sterilize the two of you.

24:54.777 --> 24:55.860
Oh, you're saying
it's 'cause of me

24:55.993 --> 24:57.838
that those creatures took them?

24:58.206 --> 24:59.831
They're experimenting,

24:59.944 --> 25:03.932
probably refining
some form of eugenics.

25:04.951 --> 25:07.942
I want you to help me
to bring them back.

25:08.072 --> 25:09.585
They're studying
you, Mr. Walker.

25:09.710 --> 25:11.783
You're obviously valuable
to them,

25:11.912 --> 25:14.762
and a good scientist always
protects his subject.

25:14.883 --> 25:15.922
For example,

25:16.037 --> 25:17.691
if your life were threatened,

25:17.806 --> 25:20.169
they would have to act
to preserve their specimen.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.840
What are you saying?

25:21.999 --> 25:23.110
If you were to be brought

25:23.259 --> 25:25.097
to the brink of death,

25:25.416 --> 25:28.957
they would return
to reverse the process.

25:29.081 --> 25:30.493
You want to kill me?

25:30.618 --> 25:32.932
No, Mr. Walker.

25:33.136 --> 25:34.992
I want to <i>almost</i> kill you.

25:35.131 --> 25:37.265
Of course, it would be ideal

25:37.429 --> 25:39.411
if you were to cooperate,

25:39.877 --> 25:42.913
but then, I'm not asking
for your permission.

25:43.101 --> 25:45.262
You're a crazy bastard.

25:46.058 --> 25:48.147
But you got my permission.

25:48.812 --> 25:51.255
If there's a chance
I could see Alma again.

25:54.314 --> 25:56.585
I'll do what I have to do.

25:56.701 --> 25:58.483
Well, then, Mr. Walker,

25:58.594 --> 26:00.668
prepare to die.

26:41.077 --> 26:44.493
You are nothin' but
trouble, lady. Give me that.

26:45.483 --> 26:47.663
You ain't got the
guts to kill no one.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.022
Give me the knife,

26:49.138 --> 26:50.948
and we'll call it a night.

27:06.462 --> 27:08.612
Haven't prayed in years, Father.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.142
How does it feel?

27:10.532 --> 27:12.687
Strange, but good.

27:13.032 --> 27:17.614
Nobody ever gave me this shot...
to rehabilitate myself.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.380
As the figurehead
of this institution,

27:19.511 --> 27:23.020
I want all of our patients
to find forgiveness

27:23.342 --> 27:25.383
and a new purpose.

27:25.742 --> 27:27.039
Even you,

27:27.511 --> 27:29.581
in spite of your crimes.

27:29.698 --> 27:32.452
Oh, I want to be saved, Father.

27:33.079 --> 27:34.563
I'm already living in hell.

27:34.672 --> 27:36.973
I don't want to spend eternity

27:37.107 --> 27:40.361
- there, too.
- You could be my miracle, Leigh.

27:40.527 --> 27:42.546
Do you repent of your sins?

27:43.381 --> 27:44.311
I do.

27:44.421 --> 27:47.224
If I can turn a man
like you towards Christ,

27:47.345 --> 27:48.902
imagine the reforms
I could make

27:49.034 --> 27:50.183
on a national scale.

27:50.305 --> 27:52.962
Not just mental health.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.919
<i>Believe me, if</i>

27:56.055 --> 27:58.414
I ascend to the highest ranks
of the church,

27:58.518 --> 28:00.891
<i>I won't back down</i>
<i>from the fight.</i>

28:01.187 --> 28:03.460
<i>You're quite an
ambitious man, Father.</i>

28:03.572 --> 28:05.135
<i>I just want to serve</i>

28:05.251 --> 28:07.626
and make a real
difference in the world.

28:07.732 --> 28:10.932
Do you renounce Satan
and all things evil?

28:11.676 --> 28:12.894
I do.

28:13.008 --> 28:15.244
Turns your eyes
to Christ, Leigh.

28:15.939 --> 28:17.621
Whatever shackles you,

28:17.752 --> 28:19.633
your freedom lives

28:19.774 --> 28:22.015
- in him.
- Praise Jesus.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.408
Do you intend to
lead a new life,

28:24.548 --> 28:27.356
putting God first
in all things?

28:27.577 --> 28:28.954
I do.

28:31.969 --> 28:34.913
Then I baptize you in
the name of the Father,

28:35.055 --> 28:38.032
Son and the Holy Spirit.

28:47.830 --> 28:49.462
Oh, thank you, Father.

28:49.739 --> 28:52.191
I feel like a new man.

29:04.516 --> 29:07.593
Thank you, Sister. I just
needed to lie down for a bit.

30:24.335 --> 30:28.123
Hello, Oliver,
I'm here to keep my word.

30:56.610 --> 30:58.812
Missing something,
Miss Winters?

30:58.943 --> 31:00.360
It was you.

31:00.507 --> 31:01.777
You let him out,

31:01.900 --> 31:04.028
you let Bloody Face out,
I know you did.

31:04.157 --> 31:05.598
What have you got here?

31:11.491 --> 31:13.855
Miss Winters, I thought
we talked about this.

31:13.969 --> 31:16.348
It's too late,
it's already done.

31:16.485 --> 31:17.876
Really?

31:22.749 --> 31:24.250
Praise God.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.632
Your attempt to murder
this precious child

31:26.754 --> 31:28.088
was unsuccessful.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.468
You couldn't
possibly know that.

31:29.578 --> 31:31.011
Oh, but I do,

31:31.125 --> 31:33.082
and I know something else.

31:35.222 --> 31:37.266
It's a boy.

31:42.556 --> 31:44.638
I think I need
another posthypnotic suggestion,

31:44.758 --> 31:45.594
Dr. Gardner.

31:45.717 --> 31:48.984
I ate an entire bucket
of chicken by myself last night.

32:03.431 --> 32:05.361
Dr. Gardner?

33:14.994 --> 33:17.933
My God,
what did they do to you?

33:19.402 --> 33:21.759
Nothing I didn't do to you.

33:22.615 --> 33:24.360
Give me a cigarette.

33:25.396 --> 33:26.399
Come on, goddamn it,

33:26.528 --> 33:28.839
give me a cigarette;
I've earned it.

33:42.766 --> 33:44.989
Thank you.

33:47.604 --> 33:49.473
I'm sorry, Lana.

33:50.141 --> 33:52.100
Can I call you Lana?

33:53.395 --> 33:55.053
Sure.

33:56.498 --> 34:00.193
I'm truly sorry for
what I did to you.

34:01.062 --> 34:02.889
What I did...

34:03.968 --> 34:07.313
was more than just
wrong, it was immoral.

34:07.426 --> 34:09.245
It was criminal.

34:10.337 --> 34:11.629
Yes.

34:14.161 --> 34:17.328
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

34:19.581 --> 34:22.663
But I'm gonna make it
up to you, I swear it.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.476
How?

34:28.279 --> 34:30.928
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- Oh, yeah?

34:31.157 --> 34:33.821
Last time someone said that
to me, it didn't go so well.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.003
Yeah.

34:36.454 --> 34:38.690
- You don't trust me.
- No.

34:39.501 --> 34:42.170
I don't trust anyone
or anything.

34:42.295 --> 34:44.259
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
earn your trust.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.295
- You think so?
- I do.

34:52.675 --> 34:56.804
Yeah, things are going
to change around here.

35:28.483 --> 35:30.866
Well, hot damn.

35:38.259 --> 35:41.884
That pink stuff--
that's gonna kill me?

35:42.012 --> 35:43.400
Potassium chloride.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.279
I'll inject this directly
into your heart muscle,

35:46.422 --> 35:48.648
which will cause the
heart to stop beating.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.016
From my experience, it'll take

35:50.135 --> 35:52.248
approximately two
to four minutes

35:52.366 --> 35:55.421
for all the oxygen in
your brain to be depleted,

35:55.536 --> 35:57.529
and then you'll die.

35:57.647 --> 35:58.712
But you can reverse it,

35:58.823 --> 36:00.177
you can, you can
bring me back to life.

36:00.307 --> 36:02.277
This syringe contains atropine,

36:02.402 --> 36:04.554
extracted from
deadly nightshade.

36:04.679 --> 36:07.573
When I need to revive you,
I'll inject this

36:07.691 --> 36:10.191
along with adrenaline
into your system.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.559
These two drugs,

36:11.669 --> 36:14.434
administered within two
minutes after your death,

36:14.616 --> 36:18.337
along with a sharp blow to
your chest with my fist,

36:18.464 --> 36:20.654
will restart the heart.

36:23.398 --> 36:27.092
I don't mind telling you...
I'm scared.

36:27.204 --> 36:29.035
I'll admit

36:29.152 --> 36:31.823
I'm feeling slightly
apprehensive myself.

36:45.997 --> 36:47.183
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

36:47.306 --> 36:48.991
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

36:49.112 --> 36:50.700
thy will be done on Earth,
as it is in Heaven.

36:50.805 --> 36:53.445
What are you mumbling about?

36:53.765 --> 36:56.189
It's the only prayer
I can remember.

36:57.245 --> 36:59.238
Just in case.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.228
This is going to hurt.

38:17.018 --> 38:18.869
The baby's full-term.

38:19.014 --> 38:20.616
It won't be long.

38:25.635 --> 38:27.556
Grace.

38:30.303 --> 38:32.093
Who brought you here?

38:34.471 --> 38:36.895
- I thought you were...
- She'll need a room.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.280
I'll look after her.

39:04.744 --> 39:06.821
Oh, God.

39:34.140 --> 39:38.908
- Help me.
- I'm here.
