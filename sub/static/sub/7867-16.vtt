00:37.937 --> 00:39.789
Oh, you hate to see this.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.374
I love to see this!

00:41.542 --> 00:43.474
<i>Now the other players
are joining in.</i>

00:43.599 --> 00:45.849
<i>Someone could lose a tooth!</i>

00:46.839 --> 00:49.006
{\pos(192,210)}This is no time
to pat the bunny, Maggie.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.719
{\pos(192,215)}Daddy's watching a very
important Mid-Atlantic

00:51.844 --> 00:54.363
{\pos(192,215)}Hockey League Conference
Semifinal do-over game.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.096
<i>'cause we enter the seventh
amazing overtime,</i>

00:57.221 --> 01:00.186
{\pos(192,210)}<i>the members of <i>Sesame Street</i>
on Ice wait impatiently</i>

01:00.311 --> 01:02.752
{\pos(192,210)}<i>to begin their matinee performance.</i>

01:02.877 --> 01:05.512
<i>Hold the Black Label, Mabel!
The Utica Mohawks'</i>

01:05.637 --> 01:08.330
<i>Pete Mavroudis has broken
through the 'topes' defense!</i>

01:08.455 --> 01:09.669
Stop him, Babando!

01:09.794 --> 01:12.763
<i>He winds up for the shot,
and Delacroix slides in front!</i>

01:12.888 --> 01:15.157
You're supposed to be spending
time with your daughter.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.336
{\pos(192,210)}I will when it's not sports season.

01:17.461 --> 01:19.679
Now I just want to know
how the game ends.

01:19.804 --> 01:21.842
And this game is over!

01:21.967 --> 01:23.315
Unbelievable!

01:23.440 --> 01:25.502
You'll never see anything
like that again!

01:25.627 --> 01:27.878
So that will do it
from Wayne Bockhorn,

01:28.003 --> 01:30.630
Jean-Pierre PÃ©tomane,
and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde,

01:30.755 --> 01:33.843
{\pos(192,215)}here at Utica's Kill-Kwik
Rat Poison Arena.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.384
What-what's the score?!

01:35.509 --> 01:37.769
Now stay tuned for Picking
the Perfect Apple,

01:37.894 --> 01:39.306
it's already in progress.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.353
D'oh!
The score, damn you!

01:41.478 --> 01:43.769
- Once again, today's final score...
- Yeah?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.004
is already in the books.
Good night!

01:46.378 --> 01:50.394
I will never... know... the score!

01:50.519 --> 01:53.446
{\pos(192,215)}You want to know the score?
I'll tell you the score.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.532
{\pos(192,210)}Oh, Marge. This is a definite
high point for our marriage.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.617
- Here's the score, mister...
- Yes?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.387
{\pos(192,215)}Your daughter barely knows
who you are!

02:01.512 --> 02:02.837
{\pos(192,215)}That's ridiculous.

02:02.962 --> 02:04.560
{\pos(192,210)}Who's your daddy, Maggie?

02:04.685 --> 02:06.226
{\pos(192,210)}Who's your daddy?

02:12.564 --> 02:14.633
{\pos(192,215)}- He is pretty good with her.
- Oh!

02:26.104 --> 02:29.794
{\pos(192,210)}Look, Marge, it's just what you want
me spending the day with Muggsy.

02:29.919 --> 02:30.775
{\pos(192,210)}Maggie!

02:30.943 --> 02:32.880
{\pos(192,210)}Marge, you're not Naggy.

02:33.005 --> 02:35.112
{\pos(192,210)}You just set the bar
impossibly high.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.472
Can you at least bring
a sweater for Maggie?

02:37.597 --> 02:38.835
Impossibly high.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.453
Now, let's get started on the greatest
daddy-daughter day ever!

02:50.891 --> 02:52.265
{\pos(192,210)}Not even heated up.

02:52.390 --> 02:53.631
{\pos(192,210)}Typical dog.

03:00.402 --> 03:01.806
This is it, Maggie

03:01.974 --> 03:05.032
{\pos(192,210)}the place where Daddy
goes every morning.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.599
{\pos(192,210)}Now, you learn your numbers
from these billiard balls

03:10.724 --> 03:12.907
{\pos(192,210)}while Daddy gets happier and happier

03:13.032 --> 03:15.287
{\pos(192,210)}and then sadder and sadder.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.435
{\pos(192,210)}- Moe, what are you doing?
- I'm spiffing up the place!

03:20.560 --> 03:22.886
{\pos(192,210)}Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar

03:23.011 --> 03:26.175
{\pos(192,190)}for the first time ever without people
making polite inquiries?

03:29.264 --> 03:31.169
{\pos(192,210)}Huh. I got a window here.

03:32.596 --> 03:33.402
Ooh!

03:35.424 --> 03:38.087
{\pos(192,215)}Hey, Maggie could play out there,

03:38.212 --> 03:39.869
{\pos(192,215)}while I watch her from in here.

03:39.994 --> 03:41.473
{\pos(192,215)}What do you say, Maggie?

03:43.091 --> 03:45.516
{\pos(192,210)}Aw, her first enabling.

03:45.951 --> 03:48.208
{\pos(192,210)}- Hi, Maggie!
- Up here, beautiful!

03:48.333 --> 03:50.938
- Yo, Mags!
- It's me! Uncle Barney!

03:51.106 --> 03:53.701
{\pos(192,210)}Remember I taught you your ABCs.

03:53.826 --> 03:55.223
{\pos(192,210)}A-B...

03:55.411 --> 03:56.686
{\pos(192,210)}P-K...

03:57.192 --> 03:58.612
{\pos(192,210)}R...

04:00.157 --> 04:03.553
{\pos(192,210)}So, uh, I suppose you guys are still
wondering why I'm cleaning the bar.

04:03.678 --> 04:04.801
{\pos(192,210)}Woo!
Hey, Maggie!

04:04.926 --> 04:06.466
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Hello, Maggie!

04:06.591 --> 04:08.107
- Hello, Maggie!
- Hey, Maggie.

04:08.232 --> 04:09.748
Maggie, look-look at my face.

04:11.913 --> 04:13.893
It all began about a month ago...

04:14.415 --> 04:16.024
<i>It was a typical Friday night:</i>

04:16.149 --> 04:18.404
<i>me surfing the Net
at the public library,</i>

04:18.529 --> 04:20.913
<i>with occasional drinking
fountain breaks.</i>

04:21.170 --> 04:23.916
Ah, just how I like it:
warm and rusty.

04:29.779 --> 04:30.968
<i>I couldn't believe it</i>

04:31.093 --> 04:34.163
<i>I finally found an intelligent,
sophisticated woman</i>

04:34.288 --> 04:36.802
<i>who hadn't heard
any of my knock-knock jokes.</i>

04:39.132 --> 04:40.362
"Orange who?"

04:40.530 --> 04:43.449
All right, Moe, give her
the punch line nice and easy.

04:43.668 --> 04:46.827
"Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?"

04:50.373 --> 04:52.346
The gargoyle has landed!

04:52.553 --> 04:53.641
"You're funny."

04:53.766 --> 04:54.897
Ooh, very nice.

04:55.022 --> 04:56.886
Now, how can I put this? Um...

04:57.011 --> 05:01.015
"Are you sure you're not
actually some creepy guy

05:01.140 --> 05:02.745
in a public library?"

05:03.421 --> 05:05.409
"No. How about you?"

05:07.350 --> 05:11.343
"Actually, there is a much
creepier guy right next to me."

05:11.468 --> 05:13.200
You know I'm a woman.

05:13.325 --> 05:15.133
We used to own a cat together!

05:15.258 --> 05:17.257
She had babies!
Here's yours!

05:18.770 --> 05:20.754
<i>I would do anything
to chat with Maya,</i>

05:20.879 --> 05:23.030
<i>short of actually purchasing
a computer.</i>

05:23.198 --> 05:25.190
<i>We decided to take the next big step</i>

05:25.315 --> 05:27.005
<i>exchanging photos.</i>

05:27.257 --> 05:28.799
Okay, this is it.

05:28.924 --> 05:31.246
I finally get to see
what she looks like.

05:31.487 --> 05:33.582
Dast I click on this JPEG?

05:33.784 --> 05:35.152
No. I dasn't.

05:37.673 --> 05:38.712
Yes, I dast!

05:41.519 --> 05:43.641
So, what does she look like?

05:44.868 --> 05:45.680
Whoa!

05:46.297 --> 05:47.826
Yeah, she was a knockout.

05:47.951 --> 05:49.437
Which meant I was screwed,

05:49.562 --> 05:52.322
because now I had to send her
a picture of me.

05:53.736 --> 05:55.938
All right, before I send this,
I'd better, uh,

05:56.106 --> 05:59.696
un-beady the eyes,
de-Neanderthal the brow,

05:59.821 --> 06:01.691
smooth out my hate lines,

06:01.816 --> 06:04.565
lighten up the ear hair,
switch my lips,

06:04.690 --> 06:06.615
then, black tie the whole deal.

06:06.907 --> 06:09.816
Aw, I can't build
a relationship on a lie.

06:09.941 --> 06:11.578
The lies come later.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.820
She thinks I'm cute?

06:18.945 --> 06:20.682
Oh, frabjulous day!

06:20.807 --> 06:22.091
Calloo Callay!

06:23.534 --> 06:26.757
So, that's why I'm cleaning things
and flushing things,

06:26.882 --> 06:28.804
and making this place
look respectable.

06:31.331 --> 06:33.997
She's coming to meet me,
here, tonight.

06:34.817 --> 06:36.729
Moe's rat-free tavern!

06:36.990 --> 06:39.113
Oh, uh, hey, Marge.
Yeah, yeah, Homer's here.

06:39.238 --> 06:40.469
Oh, oh, you want Homer?

06:40.594 --> 06:42.956
I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler.
Heinrich Himmler.

06:43.081 --> 06:45.247
You know, the guy who invented
the Heimlich "manure"?

06:45.372 --> 06:46.766
Those are two different people!

06:46.891 --> 06:49.195
Yeah, well they're both here,
and neither one is your husband.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.953
This press conference is over.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.007
Oh, Maggie made
some new friends.

07:05.265 --> 07:08.447
Aw, burrowing your head
into your daddy.

07:08.572 --> 07:11.802
A sign that my baby is happy
and confident.

07:28.952 --> 07:30.633
Ah! Yeah.

07:30.758 --> 07:33.872
Okay, she said she'd be here
at exactly 8:00.

07:34.832 --> 07:36.743
You calling my girl a liar?!

07:40.627 --> 07:41.836
Okay.

07:45.993 --> 07:47.357
I've been stood up.

07:48.048 --> 07:49.786
Moe, I'm down here.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.471
Oh, you're a little person?

07:52.596 --> 07:56.204
No, I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
Uh, what-what's the correct term?

07:56.329 --> 07:58.177
- Little person.
- Whoa!

07:58.302 --> 07:59.987
Look at me being polite!

08:00.112 --> 08:02.601
So, aren't you gonna
invite me in?

08:02.726 --> 08:04.945
Of course, um,
I-I just have...

08:05.070 --> 08:07.293
I have to tidy up the place.
Just one sec.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.241
Ooh!

08:13.005 --> 08:14.576
Eh, yeah that's better.

08:15.091 --> 08:17.904
So, Maya, um, have you
always been this size,

08:18.029 --> 08:20.298
or is this like
a Benjamin Button deal?

08:21.671 --> 08:26.088
No, I mean, it's just that your picture
made you look more, uh, life-sized.

08:26.305 --> 08:27.930
Well, that was taken
at Legoland.

08:28.055 --> 08:30.467
I was afraid you'd be
disappointed in the real me.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.640
What, are you kidding me?
You're the best thing

08:32.765 --> 08:34.663
to come into this bar
since cable TV.

08:34.788 --> 08:36.039
And unlike cable TV,

08:36.164 --> 08:39.268
I ain't stealing you from the Chinese
restaurant across the street there.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.809
I see you watch ESPN2!

08:41.934 --> 08:43.020
I know!

08:43.188 --> 08:45.586
Yeah, that's great there,
Ling Chow.

08:45.711 --> 08:47.693
So, uh, you still
want to go out?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.195
- That's why I'm here.
- Great. Let me get a car seat.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.156
Car seat?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.532
Yeah, I took out the passenger
seat to save gas,

08:53.657 --> 08:56.425
but I'm gonna use it now
'cause we're gonna do the town!

09:00.373 --> 09:02.372
So instead of getting
a new bar sign,

09:02.497 --> 09:05.538
I saved 300 bucks
by changing my name to Moe.

09:05.663 --> 09:08.297
Moe! You eat alone
again tonight, huh?

09:08.465 --> 09:10.914
Table for one!
Facing the wall!

09:11.039 --> 09:13.557
Whoa, whoa...
not so fast, garlic press.

09:13.682 --> 09:15.430
I'm here with my date.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.847
She's beautiful!

09:17.015 --> 09:18.630
But so far away.

09:22.737 --> 09:25.449
Mmm, you're a good kisser.

09:25.661 --> 09:26.548
Yeah.

09:26.673 --> 09:30.068
I practice by siphoning gas
out of other people's tanks.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.159
But I never tasted super-premium

09:32.284 --> 09:34.072
that was half as good as you.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.419
Oh, Moe.

09:36.459 --> 09:37.305
Yeah.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.334
How did your date go, Moe?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.830
Incredible.
I've never felt like this before.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.148
It's like my heart wants to do her.

09:51.042 --> 09:52.716
So, when are we gonna meet her?

09:52.884 --> 09:55.563
Oh, I can't wait till you guys
get to, um....

10:01.080 --> 10:02.851
Yep, that's what we'd do!

10:03.394 --> 10:05.187
Uh, let me ask you guys something.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.856
How would you treat a person
who's generally dynamite

10:08.024 --> 10:11.360
but, uh, in some way
a little different?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.156
You mean like how we treat Homer?

10:13.281 --> 10:14.947
'Cause he can't remember limericks?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.188
I can, too!

10:16.313 --> 10:17.689
There once was this guy

10:17.814 --> 10:20.881
from an island off the coast
of Massachusetts, uh...

10:21.006 --> 10:23.081
Nantucket, I think it was.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.488
Anyway, he had the most unusual
personal characteristic,

10:26.613 --> 10:28.467
which was, uh...

10:28.668 --> 10:29.480
um...

10:33.797 --> 10:36.346
Look at him struggling
with the simplest rhyme.

10:36.471 --> 10:38.971
It's A-A-B-B-A, dumb-ass!

11:04.789 --> 11:06.206
There you are!

11:07.734 --> 11:11.441
Aw. Innocent babies
whistling nonchalantly.

11:11.566 --> 11:12.504
How sweet.

11:12.629 --> 11:14.956
Maggie will be back
to play with you tomorrow.

11:16.817 --> 11:18.070
Come on, Maggie.

11:18.195 --> 11:20.762
- Have some grapefruit.
- She seems upset.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.299
Maybe if I lay down a beat on
my bongos, that will soothe her.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.941
Dad, do you have any idea
what's gotten into Maggie?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.095
How would I know?

11:34.220 --> 11:36.262
You've been spending
so much time with her.

11:36.387 --> 11:37.529
I have not!

11:37.777 --> 11:39.364
Oh, right.
You think I do.

11:39.932 --> 11:40.782
Hmm.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.369
<i>When you leave your children,</i>

11:44.824 --> 11:47.539
<i>do you really know
whom you're leaving them with?</i>

11:47.664 --> 11:50.285
Your little angels are safe with me.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.503
Enjoy your second honeymoon!

11:54.991 --> 11:57.957
You, wash me unmentionables!

11:58.082 --> 12:00.185
And, you, preheat the oven

12:00.310 --> 12:02.438
for two children at 450.

12:04.130 --> 12:05.767
<i>When you can't be there,</i>

12:05.892 --> 12:08.538
<i>Prying-Eye Surveillance can.</i>

12:09.125 --> 12:10.854
<i>We take images from your camera,</i>

12:10.979 --> 12:12.997
<i>scramble them, beam them
to our orbiting satellite,</i>

12:13.122 --> 12:15.231
<i>unscramble them,
then scramble them again,</i>

12:15.356 --> 12:17.825
<i>then unscramble them
that all-important final time.</i>

12:17.950 --> 12:19.251
<i>Our competitors claim</i>

12:19.376 --> 12:20.972
<i>we scramble our images too much.</i>

12:21.097 --> 12:24.409
<i>We say, "Can you love
your children too much?"</i>

12:27.734 --> 12:30.604
<i>The only thing better than
Prying-Eye watching your children</i>

12:30.729 --> 12:32.614
<i>is you watching your children,</i>

12:32.739 --> 12:35.223
<i>and we know that's not gonna happen.</i>

12:36.206 --> 12:37.089
Hmm.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.169
Wait a second, Marge.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.063
Do you really want to use your baby

12:44.188 --> 12:46.328
as a tool to spy on your husband?

12:46.453 --> 12:48.765
- Yes, you do.
- I wasn't talking to you.

12:48.890 --> 12:51.053
When you say it,
it's not just in your head.

12:53.653 --> 12:55.094
This is where I live.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.896
Uh, so is there a knob

12:59.021 --> 13:01.118
or an open sesame-type
deal, or what?

13:01.243 --> 13:02.912
My house is over there.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.868
You didn't actually think I
lived in a tree, did you?

13:07.036 --> 13:10.169
No. Hey, no. Hey, a lot
of people live in trees.

13:10.294 --> 13:13.872
Uh, Tarzan, the Berenstain Bears,
flood victims.

13:22.987 --> 13:26.221
<i>Umpa-lumpa, we are so small...</i>

13:26.389 --> 13:27.765
Gah!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.385
Why should I be watching anything

13:29.510 --> 13:32.505
when I can look at the most beautiful
thing in the world: youse?

13:32.729 --> 13:33.885
Mese?

13:34.010 --> 13:35.227
That's right.

13:35.352 --> 13:37.398
Kiss the troll and win a prize.

13:38.671 --> 13:39.489
Yeah.

13:41.773 --> 13:44.489
Listen. There's one thing
that keeps bothering me.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.748
Is it my religion?

13:45.873 --> 13:48.505
'Cause I am a snake handler,
but not an observant one.

13:48.630 --> 13:51.991
If we have kids, they just have
to have a ceremony with a cobra

13:52.116 --> 13:54.458
by age three so
their grandfather will be happy.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.772
No, that's fine.

13:55.897 --> 13:57.788
It's just that
I can't help wondering

13:57.913 --> 14:00.266
why you've never introduced me
to anyone you know.

14:00.391 --> 14:03.592
When your mailman waved to us, you
made me hide under that traffic cone.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.072
Well, I do know this one couple...

14:06.250 --> 14:08.625
the Simpsons,
I believe their name is...

14:08.750 --> 14:10.891
that ain't too judgmental.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.472
She's a stand-up dame,
and he's a fall-down drunk.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.357
And, well, we'll make
a double date of it.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.242
Now, let's get back
to what we were...

14:17.367 --> 14:20.522
Hey, what's going on?
Whoa. You turned into a doll!

14:20.647 --> 14:22.670
I just do that to freak people out.

14:23.905 --> 14:24.860
Oh.

14:30.572 --> 14:32.287
Here she is, uh, Homer.

14:32.412 --> 14:34.858
The wonderful girl
I been telling you about.

14:34.983 --> 14:36.370
Pleased to meet you.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.160
Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate,

14:39.285 --> 14:41.774
but I have a mechanical question

14:41.899 --> 14:45.467
while the kids are out of the room,
that I can't help wondering about.

14:45.828 --> 14:46.635
Ugh!

14:47.153 --> 14:49.187
In a nuclear power plant,

14:49.312 --> 14:53.225
just how is nuclear energy
turned into electricity?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.598
Well, if I remember
my high school physics,

14:55.723 --> 14:58.109
the controlled nuclear reaction
creates steam

14:58.234 --> 14:59.718
which powers a turbine...

14:59.976 --> 15:02.757
Man, oh, man, slap a ring on that!

15:10.811 --> 15:12.053
All right, Homer.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.385
Let's see what my baby's been up to.

15:16.142 --> 15:18.750
Here we are,
Maggie that park you love.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.487
Marge, Moe and Maya are here
for our double date.

15:22.612 --> 15:24.252
Oh. Okay, I'm coming.

15:26.497 --> 15:28.646
See you when the moon comes out.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.329
Man, that made me thirsty.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.174
For you.

15:46.936 --> 15:49.347
She's beautiful, Moe.

15:49.472 --> 15:51.199
Yeah, she sure is.

15:58.342 --> 15:59.720
Here comes ours, honey.

16:03.808 --> 16:05.068
Would you look at me.

16:05.193 --> 16:07.592
I'm the happiest bartender
in the world.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.135
Sorry, fellas.

16:12.850 --> 16:14.677
Maya, there's something
I want to ask you.

16:14.802 --> 16:16.010
Um, I...

16:16.316 --> 16:17.987
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

16:18.112 --> 16:20.495
This makes more sense than
anything I've ever done.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.549
Well, other than keeping
all my Netflix movies

16:22.674 --> 16:24.415
and saying the post office lost 'em.

16:24.540 --> 16:25.892
Anyway, um...

16:26.260 --> 16:27.402
will you marry me?

16:28.713 --> 16:32.157
Are you asking me
to be your... little woman?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.660
Well, as long as you don't
mind having a small wedding.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.076
And-and we can drink
champagne out of an acorn top.

16:41.351 --> 16:44.419
Our first dance will be
on the head of a pin!

16:45.786 --> 16:47.519
I've been hogging all the good ones.

16:47.644 --> 16:50.704
All right, now you go, but,
uh, hey, keep it short!

16:53.513 --> 16:56.014
Wh-What's the matter, doll?
We were just having fun.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.486
I stopped having fun
about ten jokes ago,

16:58.611 --> 17:01.106
- and you just kept going.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

17:01.231 --> 17:02.544
Oh-Oh, forgive me, kitten.

17:02.669 --> 17:05.002
I mean cat. I mean, tiger.
I mean saber-toothed tiger.

17:05.127 --> 17:07.557
- I mean... aah.
- I think you should go now.

17:07.682 --> 17:09.579
Okay.
I screwed this up pretty bad,

17:09.704 --> 17:11.431
and, uh... and I'm sorry.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.054
How long do you people
remember things?

17:14.179 --> 17:15.018
Get out.

17:20.130 --> 17:22.644
Guys, after all the years
I've given you advice,

17:22.769 --> 17:24.501
now I need a little advice from you.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.086
We never follow your advice.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.672
The one time I did, I went
to jail for three years.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.503
You made some good friends,
didn't you?

17:30.628 --> 17:33.020
Just 'cause you're chained
to a guy don't make him your friend.

17:33.145 --> 17:35.518
Tomato, tomahto.
Now, how am I gonna win Maya back?

17:35.643 --> 17:37.972
Well, if I've learned anything
from romantic comedies,

17:38.097 --> 17:40.890
it's that you got to make
a grand, reckless gesture,

17:41.015 --> 17:43.535
the kind that looks like
it might blow up in your face.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.480
But what if it blows up in my face?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.503
Uh, with your face, who cares?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.551
You got to make me shorter, Doc.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.195
Ha, ha.
What do you mean?

17:52.363 --> 17:55.397
I mean, take out bones,
guts, whatever you got to do

17:55.522 --> 17:57.117
to make me a micro-Moe.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.682
What you're asking
is completely unethical.

17:59.807 --> 18:02.872
No licensed physician
would perform that operation.

18:03.558 --> 18:05.020
Now close your eyes,

18:05.145 --> 18:08.044
and when you wake up,
you will be a woman.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.223
No, no, no, no.

18:09.348 --> 18:11.488
I-I want to be shorter
for a woman.

18:11.613 --> 18:15.025
Uh-oh! I mixed you up
with the last guy.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.309
I look nothing like Julie Newmar!

18:22.194 --> 18:24.539
Maya is gonna love the new me!

18:24.664 --> 18:27.147
Moe, why did you do this?!

18:27.315 --> 18:29.980
Well, I ain't done nothing yet,
but I'm considering it,

18:30.105 --> 18:32.610
because I want
to share your world forever.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.044
Moe, if you have to
be like me to love me,

18:36.169 --> 18:38.241
then you're not seeing the real me.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.115
Oh, I see you, Maya.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.412
I see you every time
I look at the moon.

18:42.537 --> 18:44.893
I see you in puddles after it rains.

18:45.018 --> 18:47.616
I see you
in the glazed eye of a barfly

18:47.741 --> 18:49.288
who's had one too many.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.662
So cut me down to size, Doc.

18:53.787 --> 18:56.449
And can you wrap up the bones
so my dog can have fun with 'em?

18:56.574 --> 18:59.512
But, Moe, I don't want someone
who sees me as short.

18:59.690 --> 19:02.353
I want someone
who just sees me as beautiful.

19:03.429 --> 19:04.469
Good-bye.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.154
Okay, no more delays.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.192
I've got to watch this.

19:22.789 --> 19:24.284
I'll save you, Maggie!

19:28.091 --> 19:29.314
I'm telling!

19:32.498 --> 19:33.886
Oh, now what?

19:39.655 --> 19:41.762
Aw, sweetie, you saved me.

19:41.887 --> 19:44.204
Well, I promise that wherever
you go in this world,

19:44.329 --> 19:46.090
I will always be there for you.

19:46.215 --> 19:49.003
Oh, Maggie, I love you
from the tip of your toes

19:49.128 --> 19:52.233
to the bow on your hair
with the red blinking light.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.322
God bless your mother
for making you with me.

19:57.929 --> 19:59.511
What you watching, honey?

19:59.798 --> 20:03.117
Homer Simpson, you are
a strong finisher.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.722
And I'm good at beginnings.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.394
- Uh, what's the matter, Homer?
- Not a thing in the world.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.466
Yeah, I wish I could say the same.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.174
Moe, this is a great thing for you.

20:21.299 --> 20:24.262
You went from sitting on the sidelines
to getting in the game.

20:24.387 --> 20:26.645
Sometime when you least expect it,

20:26.770 --> 20:29.065
you'll realize
that someone loved you.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.533
And that means
someone can love you again.

20:31.658 --> 20:33.496
And that'll make you smile.

20:43.934 --> 20:45.764
Hey, Homer was right.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.937
Who'd have thought such a little woman
could make me feel so big?
