WEBVTT

00:10.774 --> 00:13.036
Jake! Jake!

00:13.107 --> 00:15.039
Hey, man, shouldn't we
conserve our energy?

00:15.106 --> 00:17.299
The Ice Creamarathon
starts tomorrow.

00:17.372 --> 00:19.736
I know what the Ice
Creamarathon is.

00:19.805 --> 00:22.294
I've been training for
weeks, and I am determined

00:22.371 --> 00:24.564
to eat more ice cream
at the Ice Creamarathon

00:24.637 --> 00:26.194
than anyone else!

00:26.270 --> 00:28.168
You sure like ice cream.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.668
Ice cream is good.

00:31.168 --> 00:32.531
What the croak was that?

00:32.601 --> 00:34.329
Came from over there.

00:35.733 --> 00:38.699
Whoa, Jake! Check it out!

00:42.165 --> 00:44.427
It's a brave, little
gnome knight.

00:44.498 --> 00:45.498
What?

00:45.563 --> 00:47.553
That's frog dressed up
like a gnome knight.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.960
Actually, I'm a gnome knight

00:50.028 --> 00:53.018
who was magically
transformed into a frog,

00:53.094 --> 00:56.527
and then I decided to
continue being a knight.

00:56.594 --> 00:58.787
And now you're, like,
attracting a mate?

00:58.860 --> 01:02.553
No! I'm on the verge of death.

01:02.625 --> 01:03.852
Oh.

01:03.924 --> 01:05.652
Well, you should
just let go, man.

01:05.724 --> 01:07.122
Yeah. You've had a good run.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.156
No.

01:09.223 --> 01:12.280
I cannot die until
I find a being

01:12.355 --> 01:14.878
whose spirit is brave and pure

01:14.955 --> 01:17.251
to take over my quest.

01:17.321 --> 01:18.617
Quest?

01:18.687 --> 01:19.983
Uh-oh.

01:20.053 --> 01:22.042
Somebody's gonna do
a quest for a frog.

01:22.119 --> 01:24.950
Tell me more about this...
quest.

01:25.017 --> 01:28.575
I have to guard
these magic beans!

01:28.650 --> 01:29.581
Huh?

01:29.649 --> 01:33.843
Two of the beans are
good, but one...

01:33.915 --> 01:36.972
is horribly evil!

01:37.048 --> 01:39.479
I have no idea which is which,

01:39.546 --> 01:42.274
so I've spent my
life guarding them,

01:42.346 --> 01:46.210
preventing them from
ever being planted.

01:46.278 --> 01:47.505
Beans?

01:48.578 --> 01:49.600
Magic beans.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.234
We'll be right back.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.469
Come on, Finn.

01:52.542 --> 01:54.509
I think I dropped my
spoon in the bush.

01:54.576 --> 01:56.405
We will take your quest.

01:56.475 --> 01:57.601
You will?

01:57.675 --> 01:59.834
Sure! Consider it guarded.

01:59.907 --> 02:01.168
Also, take this.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.229
Oh. Uh, okay. Thanks.

02:03.306 --> 02:05.966
<i>No. Thank you.</i>

02:06.039 --> 02:08.005
Uh...

02:08.071 --> 02:09.900
Whoa! - Dude, what's going on?

02:09.970 --> 02:11.436
We took over the quest.

02:11.503 --> 02:13.094
What?! The beans?!

02:13.169 --> 02:14.499
Now, wait a second.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.569
Nope. Too late.

02:18.334 --> 02:19.665
I miss him already.

02:19.734 --> 02:21.723
Well, we should get a move on

02:21.800 --> 02:23.698
if we want to make the
Ice Creamarathon.

02:23.766 --> 02:25.494
What about the quest?

02:25.566 --> 02:26.566
Really?

02:26.632 --> 02:28.495
We have to do the bean quest?

02:28.565 --> 02:29.895
I gave him my word.

02:29.964 --> 02:33.260
Yeah, I wasn't here
for that, so...

02:33.330 --> 02:36.262
<i>can't we guard the beans
and eat ice cream?</i>

02:36.329 --> 02:38.988
No, man. We're on the job.

02:39.061 --> 02:41.323
And like you always say,
"work and fun don't mix..."

02:41.394 --> 02:43.485
"Unless you're a clown."

02:43.560 --> 02:45.550
I do say that a lot.

02:49.658 --> 02:51.056
Gee.

02:51.124 --> 02:54.817
Sitting in this hot
sun, guarding beans.

02:54.889 --> 02:58.980
Boy, it sure beats 26 miles
of vanilla ice cream,

02:59.055 --> 03:03.350
or caramel ice cream,
or peach ice cream.

03:03.420 --> 03:06.875
Hey, what if we plant
the beans ourselves?

03:06.953 --> 03:09.976
- That's a terrible idea.
- No, wait. Hear me out.

03:10.051 --> 03:11.642
See, if one of these
beans is evil,

03:11.717 --> 03:14.808
then it's our duty to crush
it once and for all.

03:14.883 --> 03:16.816
Plus, two of the beans are good.

03:16.882 --> 03:18.576
If we plant them,
we'll be bringing

03:18.649 --> 03:20.616
twice as much good
into the world.

03:20.682 --> 03:22.705
And we can make it to
the Ice Creamarathon.

03:22.781 --> 03:24.679
I hadn't even
thought about that!

03:24.747 --> 03:27.213
♪ So they planted the beans ♪

03:27.280 --> 03:30.712
♪ and waited for
evil to gro-o-o-w ♪

03:30.778 --> 03:34.608
♪ So they could kill
it and g-o-o-o ♪

03:34.677 --> 03:38.336
♪ to the Ice Creamarathon ♪

03:43.375 --> 03:45.068
I'm gonna take a catnap.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.333
What?! But we have to
be ready for evil.

03:47.406 --> 03:49.838
If we take shifts,
there's less chance

03:49.906 --> 03:52.634
of us falling asleep
at the same time.

03:55.438 --> 03:57.700
All right, Finn,
Jake's a lazy bum,

03:57.770 --> 03:59.793
and this soil is ripe with evil.

03:59.869 --> 04:02.664
I cannot go to sleep until
that evil bean sprouts

04:02.735 --> 04:05.724
and is destroyed.

04:11.299 --> 04:12.697
Wake up, Jake! This is it!

04:12.765 --> 04:14.026
Huh?

04:16.630 --> 04:19.063
Aah! Bean pod!

04:19.130 --> 04:21.187
Hmm. I can't tell
if it's evil yet!

04:22.429 --> 04:23.986
Aah! Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

04:25.128 --> 04:26.389
Huh?

04:26.461 --> 04:28.518
Baby pigs dressed
in silly costumes?

04:28.593 --> 04:30.583
Aw, look how cute they look,

04:30.660 --> 04:32.126
all sleepy and snorey.

04:32.193 --> 04:34.318
Careful, Jake. It
could be a trap.

04:34.392 --> 04:36.358
We should test them
to see if they're...

04:36.425 --> 04:38.187
evil.

04:39.490 --> 04:42.615
Okay, each one of you take
one test and one pencil.

04:42.689 --> 04:44.814
You have one hour to
complete the test

04:44.889 --> 04:46.912
and prove we shouldn't kill you.

04:46.988 --> 04:48.921
And begin.

04:54.318 --> 04:56.046
Aw, they're so cute,

04:56.118 --> 04:58.108
They can hardly
hold their pencils.

04:58.184 --> 05:00.514
That doesn't fare
well for their...

05:00.583 --> 05:02.345
grade-point average.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.110
Nothing evil could
be this adorable.

05:05.182 --> 05:06.274
Wee-wee!

05:06.349 --> 05:08.679
Hmm, You might be right.

05:08.748 --> 05:11.407
The only thing on here is a cute
drawing of an ice cream cone

05:11.480 --> 05:13.343
under "do you have allerjies?"

05:13.413 --> 05:15.777
Yeah, nothing evil.

05:15.845 --> 05:17.675
Okay. The pigs are good.

05:17.745 --> 05:18.745
Yes!

05:18.778 --> 05:20.177
You hear that, guys?!

05:20.244 --> 05:22.438
You passed! A-plus!

05:22.510 --> 05:24.670
A-plus-plus!

05:27.475 --> 05:28.941
Oh, no! Jake, get ready!

05:29.008 --> 05:30.906
The second pod is about to drop!

05:30.974 --> 05:32.168
Protect the piglets!

05:32.241 --> 05:33.707
Stay back, babies!

05:34.507 --> 05:36.632
Show me what you
have to offer, pod.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.003
Magical wands?

05:40.071 --> 05:42.264
Wha?! Cool!

05:42.337 --> 05:43.928
Stop, Jake!

05:44.003 --> 05:46.027
- Wow!
- Is it evil?

05:46.102 --> 05:48.466
It's a wand that poops glitter.

05:48.535 --> 05:49.967
What's good-er than that?

05:50.035 --> 05:52.025
Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

05:52.101 --> 05:54.124
Hmm.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.090
Glitter on its own
could be evil,

05:59.165 --> 06:00.756
but with rainbows?

06:00.831 --> 06:02.195
Over my dead body.

06:02.264 --> 06:04.094
Hey, let's have some
fun with these pigs

06:04.164 --> 06:05.596
before the evil pod shows up.

06:05.663 --> 06:06.856
Yeah!

06:08.000 --> 06:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
Whew!

06:17.426 --> 06:20.188
I'm exhausted.

06:20.259 --> 06:22.589
They look so sleepy
and peaceful.

06:22.657 --> 06:24.090
We have to stay alert.

06:24.157 --> 06:26.249
The evil pod could
appear at any time.

06:26.324 --> 06:29.847
When it does, we must be ready
to destroy it immediately.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.911
And then go to the Ice
Creamarathon, right?

06:32.988 --> 06:34.284
Yeah, man.

06:34.354 --> 06:35.945
Okay.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.146
I'll take the first shift.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.312
Rhombus.

06:44.418 --> 06:46.850
Aah! Look! The third pod!

06:46.917 --> 06:48.974
It's bigger than the
other two, dude.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.277
Yeah, man.

06:50.349 --> 06:51.975
We got to kill it... now.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.105
Yea-a-a-a-a-h!

06:56.180 --> 06:58.238
Unh! Yeah! Yeah!

07:00.346 --> 07:01.642
Huh?

07:01.712 --> 07:02.804
It's squirting.

07:02.879 --> 07:05.107
Squirting? He-yup!

07:05.178 --> 07:06.768
See? Squirting.

07:06.844 --> 07:07.844
Right here.

07:08.710 --> 07:09.971
Tastes good.

07:10.043 --> 07:12.033
Dang, man. Don't
just lick stuff.

07:12.109 --> 07:14.133
It's evil. - No, it's not.

07:14.209 --> 07:16.641
It's... ice cream!

07:18.041 --> 07:19.973
Is the evil sucking you in?!

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
Jake!

07:25.672 --> 07:27.104
That was awesome.

07:27.171 --> 07:28.535
Are you poisoned?!

07:28.604 --> 07:29.536
Are you dying?

07:29.603 --> 07:30.729
No, man!

07:30.803 --> 07:31.996
It was awesome!

07:32.069 --> 07:33.626
Look, Jake.

07:33.702 --> 07:35.259
It's filling back up.

07:35.335 --> 07:36.596
Aw, yeah!

07:39.301 --> 07:42.267
This pod makes ice
cream out of nothing!

07:42.333 --> 07:45.265
It's the goodest thing
that's ever happened to me.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.854
Well, if this pod's not evil...

07:49.365 --> 07:50.661
The piglets are gone!

07:50.731 --> 07:53.253
And so are the fairy wands.

07:55.895 --> 07:56.918
Let's go!

07:56.995 --> 08:00.450
The screaming sounds are getting
stronger near Mushroom Town!

08:04.625 --> 08:07.387
Piglets! Stop this!

08:07.459 --> 08:08.720
Aah!

08:09.558 --> 08:10.558
Cram!

08:10.624 --> 08:12.987
Now I must find these
wicked piglets' weakness

08:13.056 --> 08:15.545
and use it to retro-buse them.

08:15.622 --> 08:17.213
Well, I've found my weakness.

08:19.588 --> 08:21.349
That's it! Ice cream!

08:21.420 --> 08:23.852
What about ice cream?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.352
Yes. Yes.

08:26.419 --> 08:27.351
Ha!

08:27.419 --> 08:29.408
The exams confirm my
memory of the piglets

08:29.485 --> 08:30.951
being allergic to ice cream.

08:31.018 --> 08:33.677
Just the thought of
that scares me, man.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.273
I see one of them!

08:35.350 --> 08:37.441
Get ready to release!

08:37.515 --> 08:39.106
Release!

08:45.879 --> 08:48.311
Oh, gross.

08:48.379 --> 08:49.640
Gross, man!

08:49.712 --> 08:50.872
Jake!

08:50.945 --> 08:52.138
Ugh.

08:52.211 --> 08:54.074
Jake.

08:54.143 --> 08:55.508
Jake, are you okay?

08:58.109 --> 09:00.439
I-I-I can't stop dancing!

09:00.508 --> 09:02.099
What?!

09:02.175 --> 09:03.970
It must be the glitter!

09:04.040 --> 09:05.939
Whoa. I really can't
stop groovin'.

09:06.007 --> 09:07.939
It feels weird!

09:08.006 --> 09:09.370
Go on without me!

09:17.669 --> 09:19.932
Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

09:22.668 --> 09:24.861
Freezed to meet you!

09:24.934 --> 09:26.662
Hope you saved room for dessert!

09:27.633 --> 09:30.622
Killing you with ice cream!

09:32.165 --> 09:33.756
Whoo! Yeah, man!

09:33.831 --> 09:35.627
Whoa!

09:37.630 --> 09:39.153
Jake, there's one left,

09:39.229 --> 09:41.219
and I think he's
trying to surrender.

09:41.295 --> 09:42.523
Kill it!

09:42.595 --> 09:44.788
But he's dressed as a
little construction worker.

09:44.861 --> 09:46.622
It's freakin' adorable.

09:46.694 --> 09:49.183
He's trying to trick you!
Kill it!

09:49.260 --> 09:51.590
I just don't know if I can
bring myself to do it, Jake.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.577
Why, thank you, Finn and Jake,

10:07.654 --> 10:09.643
for sort of saving our village.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.414
You're sort of welcome.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.179
Now, if you'll excuse us,

10:14.252 --> 10:17.548
we need to start removing
all of this ice cream

10:17.618 --> 10:20.140
from our homes and businesses.

10:20.216 --> 10:21.478
Not so fast.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.243
I'll take it from here, folks.

10:24.482 --> 10:25.846
He likes ice cream.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.374
Nice job, Tubby,

10:33.446 --> 10:35.878
but save room for the
Ice Creamarathon.

10:35.946 --> 10:38.377
I've always got room
for ice cream, Finn.

10:38.444 --> 10:40.604
You know that, man.

10:40.677 --> 10:43.337
Ugh. I'm going to the
Ice Creamarathon.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.399
He just really likes ice cream.

10:45.475 --> 10:47.305
