and so clearly he has one.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.000
That's the other one.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.067
They never said that.

11:06.102 --> 11:07.102
And I didn't hear the one

11:07.136 --> 11:08.758
about the goat and Astroturf.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.033
So I assume the blue tribe
hasn't found theirs.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.102
Oh. This is awesome.

11:15.067 --> 11:18.172
So to have two Beware Advantages
is an amazing feeling.

11:19.447 --> 11:21.586
It's great that
I have this powerless idol

11:21.620 --> 11:23.136
that hopefully has potential,

11:23.172 --> 11:27.413
but the "beware" part is I can't
vote at any Tribal Council

11:27.447 --> 11:30.102
until the other two are found
and-and activated.

11:30.136 --> 11:32.136
Down here,
there's that white log.

11:32.172 --> 11:33.517
Up here is that white tree.

11:33.551 --> 11:36.000
My gut says it's here.

11:38.517 --> 11:40.033
BRAD:
And I feel worst for Shan,

11:40.067 --> 11:42.344
because she is busting it
for this idol,

11:42.379 --> 11:43.620
and I haven't told her yet,

11:43.654 --> 11:45.931
and she's number one
with me and Genie.

11:45.965 --> 11:50.344
So I want her to know that
I am loyal to her all the way.

11:50.379 --> 11:52.758
I got a little extra something
to help us along the way.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.067
You found the idol.

11:54.102 --> 11:57.481
So, it's not mobilized yet.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.861
SHAN:
Brad.

11:58.895 --> 12:01.654
-This is for us now.
-[gasps] Oh, my God.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.274
So Brad trusts me completely.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.447
Because you only share
that kind of information

12:10.481 --> 12:11.447
with your number one.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.931
Okay, now, if you're ready...

12:18.413 --> 12:21.654
-What? You found both?
-Number two.

12:21.688 --> 12:23.136
-All right?
-Brad, when did you find these?

12:23.172 --> 12:25.309
Hey, these things
just fall out of the sky.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.793
What I need from you,
there's a boat coming tonight.

12:27.826 --> 12:29.413
-Okay.
-I got to get on that boat

12:29.447 --> 12:31.447
-and go to an island
to make a decision.
-Okay.

12:31.481 --> 12:33.102
And just when I think it's over,
then he tells me

12:33.136 --> 12:36.793
he also found
another secret advantage.

12:36.826 --> 12:38.793
I don't know
what any of this means.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.379
-Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
-Right?

12:40.413 --> 12:42.206
-Come on. [laughs]
-Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my...

12:42.240 --> 12:44.172
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna do.

12:44.206 --> 12:48.309
See, do I keep Brad in the game
because he's got all that power?

12:48.344 --> 12:49.758
[thunder rumbling]

12:49.793 --> 12:52.344
SHAN:
Oh, do you see that lightning?

12:52.379 --> 12:53.481
RICARD:
Yep.

12:53.517 --> 12:54.688
BRAD:
So, with this Beware Advantage,

12:54.724 --> 12:55.965
I got to sneak out at night.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.447
And I've got
to be able to provide

12:59.481 --> 13:02.413
an appearance
that I'm still in camp,

13:02.447 --> 13:03.895
because I don't know
how long I'm gonna be gone.

13:03.931 --> 13:06.136
Man, I do not want
to get caught.

13:11.586 --> 13:14.067
So I gather up the flippers,
and I gather up the oars

13:14.102 --> 13:18.826
from the canoe, and I just build
this body in my bed.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.517
And so, in the dark,
from a distance,

13:29.551 --> 13:31.551
I think if anybody kind of
gets up and looks around,

13:31.586 --> 13:33.379
they'll say, "Oh, yeah,
yeah, no Brad's sleeping.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.826
I don't want to disturb him."

13:35.861 --> 13:37.481
It's just like
Ferris Bueller's Day Off,

13:37.517 --> 13:38.895
except without the snoring.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.895
That's the only thing I needed,
and I'd have had it.

A tarp tribe advantage

14:54.206 --> 14:55.758
The tarp is very useful
for the tribe

14:55.793 --> 14:57.206
to just keep us out of the rain.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.724
Keep things dry.
When you're wet,

14:58.758 --> 15:01.517
you're miserable,
and so the tarp would be huge.

15:01.551 --> 15:03.102

15:03.136 --> 15:04.724

If all three of us wrote
"Steal a Vote,"

15:35.447 --> 15:37.586
we all lost
our vote at Tribal Council.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.206
So that's
the worst-case scenario.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.965
So just to be safe,
you'd write "a tarp"

15:41.000 --> 15:42.033
and you'd be okay.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.172
But when you split the vote,

15:43.206 --> 15:44.688
i-if you can do one tarp

15:44.724 --> 15:46.206
and two Steal a Votes,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.724

for small talk

to get down to business.

16:02.758 --> 16:04.067

to get back to camp.

16:04.102 --> 16:05.861
-What are you thinking?
-TIFFANY: What do you think?

16:05.895 --> 16:07.861
Let's just do something,
so that one of us has it,

16:07.895 --> 16:09.206
-and it's out there.
-Right.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.895

know that one of us have it.

-BRAD: So, you're down
to four players, right?
-We are.

16:14.965 --> 16:18.895

all of a sudden two is majority.

16:18.931 --> 16:20.758

choosing tarp.

16:20.793 --> 16:22.000

Tarp?

I'm erring
on the side of caution.

To go home with nothing
is kind of dangerous, too, so,

17:15.309 --> 17:19.240

to lose my vote,

18:16.413 --> 18:18.309
because although
I didn't get a Steal a Vote--

18:18.344 --> 18:19.309
which would have been great--

18:19.344 --> 18:20.792
I protected my vote

18:20.826 --> 18:23.826
and maybe gained a little bit of
trust on two different tribes.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.172
Found exactly
what I anticipated,

18:26.205 --> 18:27.723
which was nothing, because

18:27.758 --> 18:30.481
I knew that at least
one person got a Steal a Vote.

18:30.517 --> 18:31.931
There it is.

18:31.964 --> 18:34.067

Beware Advantages in my pocket.

the immunity idol

that means I'm losing my vote

seven days in?

19:30.205 --> 19:33.344

of how difficult this is,

19:33.378 --> 19:36.931

I was hoping
it was the salt water

19:45.172 --> 19:46.758
that was making
my clothes baggy,

19:46.792 --> 19:49.205
but the fact is, I'm just
turning into a little bit

19:49.240 --> 19:51.034
of a twig
and just kind of a fuzzy top.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.792
I feel like a broccoli, so...
[laughs]

19:53.826 --> 19:58.136
Broccoli is, uh... grows little
bunches on, uh, small trees, so,

a little broccoli tree, I guess.

Xander, does that surprise you
to have that kind

-All you can do out here
is introspection.

20:05.309 --> 20:07.413
I mean, all we got is time,

20:07.448 --> 20:09.758
and I know I probably
sounded absolutely delirious

20:09.792 --> 20:11.689
talking about
how I truly believe

20:11.723 --> 20:14.481
that butterflies are
dead relatives saying hi.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.067
Wow.

20:17.689 --> 20:21.654
All right, should we get
to today's immunity challenge?

20:21.689 --> 20:23.964
-Yup.
-First things first.
Got to take it back.

20:28.517 --> 20:32.103
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

20:32.136 --> 20:36.034
For today's challenge, one at
a time, you're going to swim out

20:36.067 --> 20:38.172
and cross a rope bridge
over water.

20:38.205 --> 20:42.517
When everybody gets to the end,
you'll dig up a sack of sandbags

20:42.550 --> 20:46.240
and attempt to land those
sandbags on a series of targets.

20:49.067 --> 20:53.448
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

20:53.481 --> 20:55.309
In addition, you're playing
for reward. Want to know

20:55.344 --> 20:57.136
-what you're playing for?
-Oh, yes.
-ERIKA: Yes.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.964
-Please.
-Something you would take
for granted back home.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.517
-Fruit.
-Oh.
-Okay, okay.

PROBST:
If you're feeling dehydrated,

21:07.586 --> 21:09.240
lot of fluid.
You need a pick-me-up?

21:09.275 --> 21:11.964
Natural sugars. First
to finish-- the large tray.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.792
Second to finish--
also fruit, just less of it.

21:14.826 --> 21:18.034
Losers-- Tribal Council,
and I will take your flint,

21:18.067 --> 21:22.103
or in your case, keep your flint
as punishment. All right.

21:22.136 --> 21:23.344
Luvu, you have two extra people.

21:23.378 --> 21:24.517
Who are you going to sit out?

21:24.550 --> 21:25.964
Heather and Erika.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.550
Ua, you have one extra person.
Who's it gonna be?

21:27.586 --> 21:29.550
-Genie.
-Genie gonna sit out.
Everybody else,

21:29.586 --> 21:31.862

31:56.448 --> 31:59.205
but he seems really
indebted to us right now.

32:00.275 --> 32:02.034
-He's sneaky,
but I-- and I don't...
-He's sneaky,

32:02.067 --> 32:06.931
and I don't trust him,
but I also don't trust Brad.

32:06.964 --> 32:08.862
And Brad is also sneaky.

32:08.895 --> 32:10.689
He's just a better worker--

32:10.723 --> 32:13.309
harder worker--
and better in challenges.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.344
Right now,
there are two big plans.

32:15.378 --> 32:17.240
Voting out JD.

32:17.275 --> 32:20.172
The other plan
is blindsiding Brad.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.895
I, I-I-I...

32:21.931 --> 32:24.240
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

32:24.275 --> 32:28.689
RICARD:
But now Shan doesn't know
who she wants to vote for.

32:28.723 --> 32:31.136
I'm gonna have to hope
Shan makes up her mind.

32:37.378 --> 32:39.000
JD:
You know how people say

32:39.034 --> 32:42.000
when things go bad, you know,
crap hit the fan?

32:42.034 --> 32:44.654
Today, it was like
crap hit the fan,

32:44.689 --> 32:46.240
and the fan was made of crap.

32:46.275 --> 32:47.895
I want to play with y'all.

32:47.931 --> 32:50.654
But then why didn't you tell me
about the advantage?

32:50.689 --> 32:51.895
In Survivor,

32:51.931 --> 32:53.931
you shouldn't tell people
about your advantages.

32:53.964 --> 32:55.517
And to make matters worse,

32:55.550 --> 32:57.964
I didn't tell you,
you found out.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.448
So now it's even worse for me.

33:00.481 --> 33:01.586
Yes, it is.

33:03.205 --> 33:06.826
JD:
I'm worried that I lost trust
with Ricard and Shan,

33:06.862 --> 33:09.378
and now they might
want to go for me.

33:09.413 --> 33:11.309
I do apologize for that.

33:11.344 --> 33:13.413
And I want to make it up to you.

33:13.448 --> 33:15.550
I might even just
hand it to you.

33:15.586 --> 33:17.103
Would you be willing
to hand it to me

33:17.136 --> 33:19.344
to... for safekeep...
to-to hold?

33:19.378 --> 33:21.413
Heck yeah.
I will hand it to you right now.

33:21.448 --> 33:22.964
Okay.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.103
JD:
This either
is a brilliant play by me

33:25.136 --> 33:27.619
or one of the dumbest mistakes
inSurvivor history.

33:30.792 --> 33:33.448
You'll get it back when
you're not grounded anymore.

33:33.481 --> 33:35.172
-[laughs]
-Yes, ma'am.

33:35.205 --> 33:38.000
The best avenue for me,
since I'm not using it,

33:38.034 --> 33:42.240
is to give it to her
as a form of trust.

33:42.275 --> 33:43.931
I'm a ballsy player.

33:47.862 --> 33:50.034
SHAN:
JD gives me the advantage,

33:50.067 --> 33:53.413
and, in that moment,
I think, he is in my pocket.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.619
And then I start thinking,
Brad has an idol.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.103
Right now,
I'm the deciding factor

34:00.136 --> 34:01.826
as to who goes home tonight,

34:01.862 --> 34:05.517
and unfortunately
I get emotionally connected

34:05.550 --> 34:06.826
to people in this game.

34:06.862 --> 34:09.275
Every time I look at JD,
I want to vote with him.

34:09.309 --> 34:11.965
Every time I look at Brad,
I want to vote with him.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.965
Somebody's gonna be
disappointed.

34:14.931 --> 34:17.344
I remember
when I was five years old,

34:17.378 --> 34:21.344
and I remember my mom and my dad
getting into a huge fight.

34:21.378 --> 34:24.447
And I remember my mom
making me choose

34:24.481 --> 34:26.757
if I wanted to live
with my dad or my mom.

34:26.793 --> 34:30.344
And I remember choosing my mom.

34:30.378 --> 34:33.034
My dad just started crying
in front of me.

34:36.068 --> 34:37.757
[crying]:
Like, I feel like
I let him down, you know?

34:37.793 --> 34:38.688
Even at five.

34:38.724 --> 34:41.481
And I still carry that
to this day.

34:42.481 --> 34:45.309
So this situation half dances
on that, like a bit.

34:45.344 --> 34:48.000
Like, just, like,
letting someone go

34:48.034 --> 34:49.965
that feels like family,
and, like,

34:50.000 --> 34:51.931
this is what makes
this game so difficult.

35:01.344 --> 35:03.378
♪

35:15.619 --> 35:17.172
♪

35:26.000 --> 35:30.757
Shan, Ricard had not even sat
down, and you had already...

35:30.793 --> 35:33.103
started dropping your head.

35:33.137 --> 35:35.655
SHAN:
Yeah, it's been a long day,

35:35.688 --> 35:37.655
and we definitely didn't want
to vote someone off.

35:37.688 --> 35:40.206
And so it's just sad.

35:40.240 --> 35:43.655
PROBST:
So, JD, if there was
a Survivornewspaper,

35:43.688 --> 35:46.481
which one of the five of you
is the face that represents Ua

35:46.516 --> 35:48.862
that got their ass kicked
by Yase?

35:48.896 --> 35:52.034
Oh, gosh.
Yase kicks Ua's ass. Yes.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.724
That is what is on the headline,

35:53.757 --> 35:56.240
and there's a really pretty
picture of me, you know?

35:56.275 --> 35:59.688
And I thought, being the athlete
that I've been,

35:59.724 --> 36:03.275
that I would be easily hitting
those sandbags up there.

36:03.309 --> 36:06.103
But I mean,
I just couldn't get it done.

36:06.137 --> 36:07.103
And that's on me.

36:07.137 --> 36:09.172
Ricard, in order
to win this game

36:09.206 --> 36:11.862
you have to survive
every single Tribal.

36:11.896 --> 36:13.206
So what makes the most sense?

36:13.240 --> 36:15.034
Having a tribe
that doesn't lose,

36:15.068 --> 36:16.931
so you don't have
to go to as many Tribals.

36:16.965 --> 36:18.793
Therein lies the dilemma.

36:18.827 --> 36:22.034
Tribe strength
or my personal alliances.

36:22.068 --> 36:24.896
You know, I'm kind of
starting to veer towards

36:24.931 --> 36:26.516
my own personal alliance.

36:26.550 --> 36:28.688
I'm not gonna make it very far,

36:28.724 --> 36:31.688
once we hit the merge,
if I just have strong people

36:31.724 --> 36:33.137
that don't actually like me.

36:33.172 --> 36:35.275
I need to work with people
who I trust.

36:35.309 --> 36:38.000
Wow. Genie,
Ricard is saying straight out

36:38.034 --> 36:39.378
somebody in this tribe
has lied to him,

36:39.413 --> 36:41.172
and he's not happy about it.

36:41.206 --> 36:42.757
They're probably
getting his vote tonight.

36:42.793 --> 36:45.757
He thinks he's got his alliance,
but I know I have mine, so...

36:45.793 --> 36:48.965
Do you think that he thinks
you're the one that was lying?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.172
Probably based on
the first Tribal.

36:51.206 --> 36:53.481
I don't think
Ricard's ever really truly

36:53.516 --> 36:55.413
trusted me since then.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.619
-PROBST: What happened?
-But she spelled my name right
when she wrote it down.

36:59.655 --> 37:02.068
PROBST:
Brad, it's really the one word
that comes up

37:02.103 --> 37:04.655
all the time on Survivor--
trust.

37:04.688 --> 37:05.896
BRAD:
Oh, man.

37:05.931 --> 37:08.137
Jeff, the fact is,
you got to trust somebody,

37:08.172 --> 37:09.724
because, in the end,
that's all you got.

37:09.757 --> 37:10.965
-Yeah.
-BRAD: And so,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.206
to build trust,
you say what you're gonna do

37:12.240 --> 37:13.585
and then you do it.

37:13.619 --> 37:16.757
JD:
Jeff, we're all
talking about trust,

37:16.793 --> 37:19.172
and I feel like
somehow, someway,

37:19.206 --> 37:21.896
I've lost a lot
of you guys's trust.

37:21.931 --> 37:25.275
Where trust in this game
is like crystal, right?

37:25.309 --> 37:28.619
And each one of you has your
own crystal, and it's precious.

37:28.655 --> 37:30.103
It's not easily given away.

37:30.137 --> 37:34.550
And I hope that, even though
I may have dropped your crystal,

37:34.585 --> 37:36.516
that you don't drop mine.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.516
In a game like Survivor,
relational stock

37:39.550 --> 37:41.793
is hard to rebuild
once it's gone.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.034
It's beautiful
to pick up crystals,

37:44.068 --> 37:46.344
once they've been
broken and-and dashed.

37:46.378 --> 37:47.793
It's even better when you,

37:47.827 --> 37:49.240
when you don't dash them,
you know?

37:50.240 --> 37:53.000
JD, you seemed to get down
the minute Shan said,

37:53.034 --> 37:55.688
"Yeah, it's pretty hard
to put a crystal back together."

37:55.724 --> 37:58.068
Yeah, it's heartbreaking,

37:58.103 --> 38:01.688
but I think
writing down my name tonight,

38:01.724 --> 38:02.862
like, look at my leg,

38:02.896 --> 38:04.619
will be
like scratching a mosquito bite.

38:04.655 --> 38:07.447
You know, and you may feel
a little relief now,

38:07.481 --> 38:09.172
but in the long run
it's gonna get a lot worse.

38:10.965 --> 38:12.585
PROBST:
So, Brad, what's the good

38:12.619 --> 38:15.516
that could come from this vote
when you go back to camp,

38:15.550 --> 38:16.516
the four of you?

38:16.550 --> 38:17.896
Jeff, if you can
make it through this,

38:17.931 --> 38:19.896
what don't kill
you makes you stronger.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.240
And so, once we're walking back,

38:22.275 --> 38:24.172
the morale
is gonna start going back up.

38:24.206 --> 38:26.757
It's bittersweet,
but it's a healthy cycle.

38:27.757 --> 38:31.793
PROBST:
JD, if you're not here
and this is the end,

38:31.827 --> 38:33.896
what's it been like
for seven days for JD?

38:33.931 --> 38:35.655
JD:
I've said it so many times,

38:35.688 --> 38:37.965
my faith and my family
are my foundation, obviously,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.034
but Survivorbuilt me up.

38:40.068 --> 38:44.000
I went through my life
really skinny and nerdy

38:44.034 --> 38:46.516
and short and-and not cool,
and I was bullied a lot.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.862
And, through all of that,
I would go home

38:48.896 --> 38:52.000
and I could turn on the TV
and I would watch Survivor.

38:52.034 --> 38:55.447
And I could live vicariously
through Ozzy and Malcolm.

38:55.481 --> 38:57.413
All my heroes.
I wanted to be like them.

38:57.447 --> 38:58.724
Why do you think
I have this hair?

38:58.757 --> 39:00.931
You know, why do you think
I wear the necklace

39:00.965 --> 39:03.103
and I, like,
I quote Woo so much?

39:03.137 --> 39:06.309
And without Survivor,
I wouldn't be this guy

39:06.344 --> 39:08.516
who-who is so confident
in himself.

39:08.550 --> 39:12.172
And so, when I tell you that
Survivormade me who I am

39:12.206 --> 39:15.757
and that I want to do that for
kids now, that's not a front.

39:15.793 --> 39:19.034
I just wanted to play Survivor.

39:19.068 --> 39:23.000
And I, and I, even if
it's cut short, I got to do it.

39:24.344 --> 39:27.000

of all ages, to not fear fear.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.240
And that kind of enthusiasm
that you all have
