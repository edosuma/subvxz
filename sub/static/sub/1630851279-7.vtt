WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:02.378
- You can't see it.
- I want to see it.

00:02.402 --> 00:03.913
- No. You are not
allowed to see it.
- Oh, thanks.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.337
[laughs]

00:05.372 --> 00:07.740
Cheers that the dress fits.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.508
Oh, wow. I love this.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.220
I just left the military
this last year

00:11.244 --> 00:13.846
<i>and being able to be a bride</i>

00:13.880 --> 00:16.515
is just a dream come true.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.284
I feel so beautiful,
like, I wanna cry.

00:20.954 --> 00:24.923
This just screams,
"Put me in the snow
and marry me."

00:24.958 --> 00:26.558
Just isn't classy.

00:29.229 --> 00:33.065
Sometimes if families
don't jump on
the bandwagon

00:33.133 --> 00:34.210
<i>and show the enthusiasm,</i>

00:34.234 --> 00:35.911
<i>it could really destroy
the appointment</i>

00:35.935 --> 00:38.447
and make the bride
feel like she doesn't
want the dress.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.882
Oh, my God, it better fit.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.107
I feel anxious.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.853
<i>I gained a little bit of weight.</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.378
I'm so afraid,
it's not gonna fit.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.790
Can you hold this one for me?

00:47.814 --> 00:49.654
- Help me.
- [Danielle] Yeah.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.099
[Lisa] All right.
Let's see.

01:02.028 --> 01:05.164
I know that my bride
Jenny favorited
some dresses.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.279
I just wanna
check them out,
so that I can get...

01:09.769 --> 01:11.247
everything ready for her.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.151
It's so good when they do this.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.309
Y'all, I'm gonna be on
<i>Say Yes to the Dress!</i>

01:17.343 --> 01:18.988
So, help me pick out my outfit.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.756
I've been watching
<i>Say Yes to the Dress</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:22.525
since I was
a little girl
with my mom,

01:22.549 --> 01:24.326
and so, I've just imagined

01:24.350 --> 01:26.685
<i>having this moment
my entire life.</i>

01:26.719 --> 01:29.288
Imagine me walking
into Kleinfeld.

01:29.322 --> 01:34.426
I'm a country artist,
but I feel very
bridal and chic.

01:34.461 --> 01:37.463
I'm from Tennessee,
so New York city
is very different.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.675
A, B or C,
which one?
Help me out.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.619
I'm going to New York very soon.

01:45.805 --> 01:49.441
Say yes to dress.
Say yes to dress.

01:49.476 --> 01:51.043
[all exclaiming]

01:52.679 --> 01:54.423
My dad was in
the music industry.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.025
<i>He was a singer
back in the '80s.</i>

01:56.049 --> 01:58.183
<i>And I got a guitar
when I was 16.</i>

01:58.218 --> 02:00.452
<i>It was kind of this
light bulb moment.</i>

02:00.487 --> 02:02.354
When I know it's the dress,

02:02.388 --> 02:04.834
that is when
the guitar
will come out.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.359
Ooh, that looks like...

02:08.595 --> 02:10.395
snowy branches.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.999
- Check, it, Mom...
- Jenny, Jenny.

02:14.033 --> 02:14.900
[Lisa exclaims]

02:14.934 --> 02:17.636
- Hi. How are you?
- Oh, my goodness. Hi.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.215
I am good.
How are you?

02:19.239 --> 02:20.850
- I'm Lisa, I am great.
- I know.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.175
- I know you, Lisa.
- [all laughing]

02:23.209 --> 02:25.077
And you guys, who are you?

02:25.111 --> 02:27.456
- I am mom.
- And I'm Katie,
Jenny's sister.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.814
Hi, Katie. Lisa.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.659
Oh, my God,
what a beautiful family.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.684
- Thank you.
- Look at these outfits.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.530
We've got our pop of fringe

02:34.554 --> 02:36.332
and our pop of rhinestones

02:36.356 --> 02:39.057
that I always have fringe
and rhinestones on,

02:39.092 --> 02:41.737
- in some aspects.
- What's the pop
of this?

02:41.761 --> 02:43.841
So, I have a pop of
snow boots as well.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.330
Snow boots?

02:45.365 --> 02:49.401
I'm getting married
in this snow in
Jackson, Wyoming

02:49.435 --> 02:52.148
<i>My fiancee Dave</i>
<i>and I fell in love</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:54.517
<i>When we finally</i>
<i>admitted our love</i>
<i>to each other,</i>

02:54.541 --> 02:58.243
we had the biggest
snow storm in five years
in Nashville that night.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.415
[sniffles] Yes.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.918
We got engaged in
the snow in Wyoming,

03:05.952 --> 03:08.264
and so now we're
gonna get married
in the snow.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.498
He just proposed to me.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.757
[woman] I know!
Congratulations!

03:14.627 --> 03:17.162
Our ceremony is
gonna be outside,

03:17.197 --> 03:20.532
so we're gonna
have a beautiful
snow backdrop,

03:20.567 --> 03:21.610
but I need to have a dress

03:21.634 --> 03:24.570
that I can hide
these under. [laughs]

03:24.604 --> 03:25.948
As I'm walking down the aisle,

03:25.972 --> 03:28.240
I want to feel like a snowflake,

03:28.274 --> 03:30.075
like a womanly snowflake.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.555
Do we have a budget in mind?

03:32.579 --> 03:35.491
So, I'd like to
stay in between
$3,000 and $3,500.

03:35.515 --> 03:38.227
Okay. We're gonna find
your wedding dress.
I have no doubt.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.728
- [Jenny] Perfect.
- All right?

03:39.752 --> 03:40.786
See you guys soon.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.964
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

03:41.988 --> 03:42.988
Come on back.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.795
Oh, yes.
It's so pretty.

03:49.829 --> 03:50.940
[camera shutter clicks]

03:50.964 --> 03:52.998
[Lisa] I saw from your profile

03:53.032 --> 03:54.977
- that you had
pre-selected dresses.
- Yeah.

03:55.001 --> 03:58.704
I pre-pulled
three of the dresses
that you had saved.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.706
This is Martina Liana.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.275
That's my favorite,
just looking at it.

04:03.309 --> 04:04.787
[Lisa]
Do you know what?
Mine, too.

04:04.811 --> 04:05.988
[Jenny]
There's a Pronovias.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.057
- I don't know if you
guys have this one.
- Let's see.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.658
And this is the one
that you're gonna
hate me for

04:09.682 --> 04:12.951
because I know
it's over my budget,
but I love it.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.187
[Lisa] Ah, it's over $5,000.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.499
- I think I'd like
to just try it.
- Okay.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.068
Just know that if you love it,

04:19.092 --> 04:21.403
you need to be
prepared to either
give it up

04:21.427 --> 04:23.395
- or pay for it.
- That's true.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.241
- Okay. Got it.
- [Lisa] Okay?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.634
I think that we should

04:28.668 --> 04:31.503
start with this one.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.116
[Jenny]
<i>From what I can tell,</i>

04:34.140 --> 04:35.618
just by looking at it
on the hanger,

04:35.642 --> 04:37.620
it has everything that
I want in a dress.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.954
It's got the long sleeves,

04:38.978 --> 04:40.279
sparkle everywhere,

04:40.313 --> 04:42.233
the neck line with the illusion.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.526
<i>So, I am a little apprehensive</i>

04:44.550 --> 04:47.129
to try it on first
'cause if I love it
then what do we do,

04:47.153 --> 04:50.289
you can't say yes
to the first dress,
or can you?

04:50.323 --> 04:52.691
- Look at this.
- I'm dying.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.826
- I love this.
- [Lisa] We're done.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.561
I think we could be.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.231
I feel so beautiful,
like, I want to cry.

04:59.265 --> 05:03.235
Growing up, I just
always kinda felt like
the ugly duckling

05:03.269 --> 05:04.703
out of the bunch.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.181
- I mean,
you saw my sister...
- What bunch?

05:06.205 --> 05:07.439
She's gorgeous.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.718
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>people would look</i>
<i>at her and be like,</i>

05:09.742 --> 05:11.253
<i>"Oh, my gosh,
you're so beautiful."</i>

05:11.277 --> 05:13.188
<i>And then</i>
<i>they would look at me</i>
<i>and be like,</i>

05:13.212 --> 05:14.523
<i>"Oh, you guys are sisters?</i>

05:14.547 --> 05:16.615
You don't look
anything alike."

05:16.649 --> 05:18.427
Growing up with
Jenny, I could tell
that sometimes

05:18.451 --> 05:20.686
she had a little bit
of a difficult time.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.365
[Kathleen]
<i>She actually was</i>
<i>very well liked.</i>

05:23.389 --> 05:26.425
I think she just didn't feel...

05:26.459 --> 05:29.561
She didn't feel
100% confident
in her own skin.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.973
I did not grow up beautiful.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.941
- It took me a second
to get here.
- Okay.

05:32.965 --> 05:35.711
She is very beautiful,
but you are
stunning, too.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.601
[Jenny]<i> Thank you.</i>

05:36.636 --> 05:38.676
I'm a comparer,
I think is what I am.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.450
I'm always just like,
"Oh, well, yeah,
I can be pretty,

05:41.474 --> 05:43.075
but not that pretty."

05:43.109 --> 05:44.887
You know, and so I feel like...

05:44.911 --> 05:46.588
I don't know,
this dress makes
me feel like

05:46.612 --> 05:48.680
I'm that pretty

05:48.715 --> 05:49.815
You are.

05:49.849 --> 05:53.418
I'm very self-aware
that I have
this insecurity

05:53.453 --> 05:54.530
about the way that I look.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.231
I mean, even a lot of my music,

05:56.255 --> 05:58.223
<i>there's lot of songs like that</i>

05:58.257 --> 06:00.336
<i>that are</i>
<i>focusing on that</i>
<i>woman narrative</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:02.338
that where
she's looking
in the mirror

06:02.362 --> 06:04.763
and judging herself
or loving herself.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.443
<i>That's something</i>
<i>I'm really trying</i>
<i>to work hard on.</i>

06:07.467 --> 06:12.738
So, today, I would love
to be able to look
in the mirror and say,

06:12.772 --> 06:15.533
"I love you
and I think
you're beautiful."

06:18.344 --> 06:19.444
Wow.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.847
She did too good
on the first one,

06:21.881 --> 06:23.715
I'm like,
"Wait a second."

06:27.653 --> 06:30.032
- [Lisa] What do
you guys think?
- I like it.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.201
-It's very pretty.
-[Lisa]
Isn't it stunning?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.326
[Jenny]
I feel so pretty.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.596
- [all laugh]
- I love all of this.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.165
[Lisa] Not all dresses
have this kind of neck

06:40.233 --> 06:42.845
and not every bride
looks great in
this neckline.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.580
A lot of people
need the opening,

06:44.604 --> 06:46.248
but you're already long.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.274
This is so stunning.

06:49.308 --> 06:53.345
I feel like it just
looks like snow
covered branches...

06:53.379 --> 06:55.459
- [Katherine] Yeah.
- Coming off of me.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.961
I'm standing here
and I'm thinking,

06:58.985 --> 07:00.852
"Oh, no,
I love this one."

07:00.887 --> 07:02.197
<i>But my mom and my sister</i>

07:02.221 --> 07:06.758
<i>are both very reserved
in their emotions.</i>

07:06.793 --> 07:10.262
If my family doesn't
love this dress,
I'll be really upset.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.707
[Lisa] Let me lay out
the train a little.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.199
Can you turn that way
just so I can
really lay it out,

07:14.201 --> 07:17.702
so you can appreciate
the beautiful drama.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.837
[Jenny gasps]

07:18.871 --> 07:21.791
It's exactly what
you were describing
you wanted.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.354
[Lisa]<i> Her family is</i>
<i>kind of indifferent</i>
<i>to this dress.</i>

07:25.378 --> 07:28.747
<i>I would've liked to</i>
<i>have seen a little more,</i>
<i>"Wow, it's gorgeous".</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:32.384
Sometimes,
if families don't jump
on the bandwagon

07:32.418 --> 07:33.729
and show the enthusiasm

07:33.753 --> 07:35.397
it could really destroy
the appointment

07:35.421 --> 07:38.461
and make the bride
feel like she doesn't
want the dress.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.469
- [Chloe] Oh, my God.
- I love that.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.647
- That?
- Yeah.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.005
Not the A-line.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.008
Walking into Kleinfeld
today is amazing.

07:57.043 --> 08:01.046
<i>I have been anticipating</i>
<i>this day since the day</i>
<i>we got engaged.</i>

08:01.080 --> 08:02.791
I mean, I was excited
to come here before,

08:02.815 --> 08:04.749
but now that I'm actually here,

08:04.784 --> 08:06.428
I'm even more excited.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.264
- We are looking for
Alayna and Chloe.
- [Chloe] Hey.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.833
- Hi, ladies.
- Hello. Hi, Chloe.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.734
-I'm Amber.
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.758
Nice to meet you.

08:13.793 --> 08:14.937
- Congratulations.
- [Chloe] Thank you.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.605
- And I'm looking
for Alayna?
- [Alayna] I'm Alayna.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.507
-I am Mindy.
Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.008
Lovely.
Who did you bring
with you today?

08:20.032 --> 08:22.267
This is my mama, Kim.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.437
And this is
my friend Emily.
And then...

08:25.471 --> 08:27.382
This is my Maid
of Honor, Sabrina.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.584
[Amber] Nice to meet you guys.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.152
[Mindy] Guys, welcome.
Are you guys excited?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.010
- Yes, very.
- How did you
guys meet?

08:32.012 --> 08:35.113
[Alayna]
<i>We've been together</i>
<i>a year and four months,</i>

08:35.147 --> 08:37.549
<i>and it sounds odd and cliche,</i>

08:37.583 --> 08:39.951
<i>but from the get-go,
she just felt like home.</i>

08:39.986 --> 08:43.788
I just was like,
"This is comfortable,
this feels accepting,

08:43.823 --> 08:45.457
it feels like home."

08:45.491 --> 08:50.161
I was really taken back
by, like, how smart
and beautiful she was,

08:50.196 --> 08:54.799
and I just knew,
I guess, that
first date that, like,

08:54.834 --> 08:57.636
this was something,
something more.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.982
So, Chloe, I'd love
to hear what
you're thinking.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.140
So far, I have liked
fit and flare.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.553
- Okay.
- I would like
a sweetheart neckline,

09:04.577 --> 09:06.611
something that, like, isn't

09:06.646 --> 09:08.457
- a cookie cutter
wedding dress.
- Okay.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.225
Something that feels flattering

09:10.249 --> 09:13.218
that I just, like,
feel amazing in.

09:13.252 --> 09:15.887
I was married before,
around 13 years ago.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.124
You know, I hadn't come out

09:19.158 --> 09:20.536
or started transitioning yet.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.662
And I guess it,
you know,
it never felt right

09:23.696 --> 09:27.599
when you're not
able to be your
authentic yourself.

09:27.633 --> 09:32.470
And, um, you know,
like wearing a tux
never felt right for me.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.283
So, to see how far we've come,

09:34.307 --> 09:37.842
<i>and to be living
my authentic life today</i>

09:37.877 --> 09:41.212
<i>and have such</i>
<i>an amazing partner</i>
<i>like Alayna,</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:42.958
it's really, really amazing.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.316
What are you envisioning?

09:44.350 --> 09:47.686
So, I would
describe it as,
like, boho-glam.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.821
I have an obsession
with beaded fringe.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.667
- I have an obsession
with fringe. Period.
- [Mindy] Okay.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.292
I love rhinestones
and I love bling.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.071
I just want to feel
like a moon goddess.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.497
Let's say,
evening wedding in
this garden,

09:59.532 --> 10:01.967
<i>at a beautiful lake resort,</i>

10:02.001 --> 10:05.303
<i>and the kind of vibe
is enchanted forest.</i>

10:05.338 --> 10:07.015
<i>- So, I just wanna...</i>
- [Chloe]<i> Very celestial.</i>

10:07.039 --> 10:08.350
[Alayna]
<i>Getting married</i>
<i>under the moon.</i>

10:08.374 --> 10:10.185
- Love it. Okay, cool.
- Okay.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.477
This was my mother's
head piece and veil

10:12.511 --> 10:15.023
from when she got
married 40 years ago
to my dad.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.515
So, hopefully,
when we find the one,

10:17.550 --> 10:19.510
we know that
it all works together.

10:19.752 --> 10:20.796
- I love it.
- Okay.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.632
Where do we wanna
stay price point
for both of you?

10:23.656 --> 10:25.724
I would like to stay
around $2,500.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.126
- Okay. And Chloe?
- Yeah, around $3,000.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.238
Around $3,000,
okay, perfect,
we can do that.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.374
[Mindy] You don't
want to see each other's
dresses, right?

10:32.398 --> 10:33.809
- You want it
to be a surprise?
- Yeah.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.143
[Mindy] Fantastic.
Okay, cool.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.602
My biggest concern
for today is that

10:37.637 --> 10:40.382
Alayna is not going to
find something that
she absolutely loves.

10:40.406 --> 10:44.843
<i>She is very</i>
<i>detail oriented</i>
<i>and very specific.</i>

10:44.877 --> 10:48.046
And those qualities
make life with her great.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.649
We balance each other
out really well.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.494
Um, but I just
really, really hope

10:52.518 --> 10:55.987
that she finds
something she absolutely
loves here.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.357
[Mindy]
You mentioned fringe.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.593
So, All Who Wander
is the only designer

11:01.627 --> 11:03.238
that we have that has fringe.

11:03.262 --> 11:07.565
Because it definitely
is that quintessential,
bohemian vibe.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.101
So, I'm definitely
gonna pull that one.

11:10.136 --> 11:14.172
Um, like, this to me
feels a little bohemian.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.207
It's got the two-tone.

11:16.242 --> 11:19.411
It has that
shimmer underneath.
It's got the beading.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.445
I'm not sure how
she'll feel about
the spaghetti strap,

11:22.581 --> 11:23.782
but we'll try it.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.029
[Amber]<i> They're</i>
<i>the cutest couple.</i>

11:27.053 --> 11:29.354
But Chloe seems
a little nervous.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.090
And I don't know why,
but I'm a little nervous,

11:32.124 --> 11:35.193
and I can't wait to
bring Randy into it.

11:35.227 --> 11:39.264
- Hi, Randy.
- I hear we have a really
exciting appointment today.

11:39.298 --> 11:41.076
I hear we have two brides.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.012
- Yeah, and I was
thinking Maggie Sottero.
- [Randy]<i> Okay.</i>

11:44.036 --> 11:46.081
- I can flip the camera
so you can see it.
<i>- I'd love to see it.</i>

11:46.105 --> 11:47.249
<i>I'd love to see
what it looks like.</i>

11:47.273 --> 11:49.841
<i>So, very ornate.
Lovely, beautiful.</i>

11:49.875 --> 11:52.587
Okay, I'm gonna
grab this guy,
too, actually.

11:52.611 --> 11:56.314
This one is
Martina Liana.
And this dress...

11:57.883 --> 12:00.185
has, like,
really cool detailing.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.097
She doesn't want
anything cookie cutter.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.356
And I think that
this design is not
cookie cutter.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.136
-[Randy]<i> Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>That's pretty.</i>
-This is pretty, right?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.439
<i>This is exciting.</i>
<i>I'm excited about</i>
<i>this appointment.</i>

12:10.463 --> 12:12.307
I know.
I'm very excited, too.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.443
<i>I'm gonna put you down</i>
<i>and pull some</i>
<i>more dresses.</i>

12:14.467 --> 12:17.278
And then once
one of the brides
has a gown on,

12:17.302 --> 12:19.748
- we'll grab you
again, okay?
- Sounds great.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.140
Oh, my gosh.
[gasps]

12:22.975 --> 12:25.810
Wow, this dress is so different.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.605
Okay, you can look now.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.748
Oh, my gosh.

12:29.782 --> 12:33.418
[Danielle]<i> I always had,</i>
<i>you know, body issues</i>
<i>back to high school.</i>

12:33.452 --> 12:36.488
So, I always
was getting shamed
for how I looked.

12:36.522 --> 12:39.301
And I think it really
stuck with me
as an adult.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.669
I am a little nervous...

12:40.693 --> 12:42.938
- [woman] Why?
- that it's gonna be
a little too snug.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.029
I feel anxious.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.998
I'm sweating.

12:47.032 --> 12:50.435
I'm so afraid
that I'm gonna be
embarrassed

12:50.469 --> 12:52.389
<i>because my dress
isn't gonna zip.</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:06.795
Which one you wanna start with?

13:06.819 --> 13:08.319
Um,

13:08.354 --> 13:10.332
- I wanna go ahead
and try this one.
- Okay.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.490
<i>Initially, when I heard
from Alayna</i>

13:12.558 --> 13:18.196
<i>that she was interested</i>
<i>in bling, fringe,</i>
<i>moon goddess, boho,</i>

13:18.230 --> 13:19.998
I got a little scared

13:20.032 --> 13:24.435
because there's
not a ton of options
in that world.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.349
<i>But this Essence</i>
<i>of Australia gown has</i>
<i>a lot of the elements</i>

13:27.373 --> 13:28.784
<i>that she's been describing.</i>

13:28.808 --> 13:31.609
Dress No.1.
What are we thinking?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.288
This is a gorgeous dress.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.346
So, working with
Alayna is actually

13:35.381 --> 13:36.925
part of a double appointment

13:36.949 --> 13:38.493
<i>that I'm in with
Amber right now.</i>

13:38.517 --> 13:41.653
<i>And it's a little tricky</i>
<i>because the brides</i>
<i>need to coordinate</i>

13:41.687 --> 13:43.598
<i>their wedding dresses,</i>
<i>but they don't wanna</i>
<i>see each other</i>

13:43.622 --> 13:44.823
before the wedding day.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.759
Let me just peek
my head out
real quick.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.938
- Hey, Amber,
she's not out?
- No.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.762
- So, I'm good to go?
- Yeah.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.133
Oh, look how gorgeous you look.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.678
Dress No. 1,
this looks good.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.481
- I have to grab Randy.
- [Amber] Yeah,
I love the back.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.840
- Hello.
- Hey, beautiful.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.875
All right.
So, Alayna,

14:03.909 --> 14:06.388
I have Randy
in my hands
at the moment.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.512
Hello. Hello.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.586
- How are you?
- I'm well. I'm excited.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.327
[Randy]<i> Let me</i>
<i>see the dress</i>
<i>you're wearing.</i>

14:12.351 --> 14:14.552
So, this is
an Essence of Australia.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.588
[Randy]<i> Beautiful.</i>

14:16.622 --> 14:20.058
Okay, Randy,
so I'm going to go
bring Alayna out

14:20.092 --> 14:21.892
- to see her family.
- Okay.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.730
Yay!

14:29.602 --> 14:32.670
All right, guys.
Dress No. 1.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.350
And I have
a special guest here.
We've got Randy.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.652
- [all] Hi.
- Hello,
beautiful ladies.

14:37.676 --> 14:38.843
Oh, my God.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.589
So, I'm gonna hand you off

14:40.613 --> 14:42.847
to mama Kim, Randy,
if that's okay.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.659
- [Randy]<i> Wonderful.</i>
- [Mindy] Perfect.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.895
- [Emily] Look at
all the glitter.
- [Kim] I know.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.253
Isn't it gorgeous?

14:48.287 --> 14:50.699
- [Kim] You're literally
sparkling in the light.
- [Emily] Yeah.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.167
- [laughter]
- Sparking in
the moonlight.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.258
The radiance.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.172
So, what do we think, ladies?

14:58.530 --> 15:00.431
I think it's beautiful, um,

15:00.466 --> 15:02.634
but then, Randy, I'm biased.

15:02.668 --> 15:07.405
If she comes out
in a potato sack,
I'm just gonna...

15:07.439 --> 15:10.318
[Alayna] But it has to
have multiple features,
the potato sack.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.054
- A glittery potato sack.
- Yeah, glittery
potato sack.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.313
Yeah, I mean, I agree.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.459
I feel like you have
the southern in this,

15:17.483 --> 15:19.394
- but you need
the hippie southern.
- [Alayna] Yes.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.063
- [Emily laughs]
- [Alayna] That's a very
good description.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.554
What I'm hearing is that

15:23.622 --> 15:26.301
you're really
kind of looking for
more of a boho look.

15:26.325 --> 15:27.759
<i>Is that correct?</i>

15:27.793 --> 15:32.096
[Alayna] Ideally,
if something existed
that was like boho-glam,

15:32.131 --> 15:33.508
that would be perfection.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.310
She used
the word "witchy."

15:35.334 --> 15:36.234
Witchy.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.312
[Alayna]<i> We want</i>
<i>like a glamourous,</i>

15:37.336 --> 15:39.537
- like, witchy vibe.
- Yeah.

15:39.571 --> 15:42.140
-[Mindy]
Stevie Nicks vibe.
-Okay.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.451
I think we can come up with it.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.320
I'm feeling pretty confident.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.184
I think we're gonna do fine.

15:53.752 --> 15:57.789
This just screams,
"Put me in the snow
and marry me."

15:57.823 --> 15:59.567
And, "I feel like
a beautiful snowflake."

15:59.591 --> 16:02.961
I feel like
a beautiful snowflake
walking down the aisle.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.906
Yeah, looks really good
and I think this cut

16:04.930 --> 16:07.031
would really
hide the boots, too.

16:07.066 --> 16:10.368
I'm seeing that
my mom and sister
love this dress,

16:10.402 --> 16:12.480
but I also feel like
they're a little
apprehensive.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.982
[Lisa]
I have to be honest,
with you,

16:14.006 --> 16:16.017
these boots happen
to look good
with this dress.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.343
Getting some emotion
out of them today

16:18.377 --> 16:21.279
will be one of my challenges.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.615
She told me something
in the dressing room
that I was shocked about,

16:24.650 --> 16:26.461
which is that,
she told me that
growing up,

16:26.485 --> 16:28.029
she always felt like
the ugly duckling.

16:28.053 --> 16:32.156
She had a rough teenage years.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.826
Jenny went through a very...

16:34.860 --> 16:38.129
Having a lot of
anxiety as a teenager.

16:38.163 --> 16:42.333
And now, like,
I can't even believe
that's the same girl.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.346
- [Lisa] Ugh.
- [Jenny] Terrible
anxiety issues

16:44.370 --> 16:47.538
and so, um,
the person that
you see right now,

16:47.573 --> 16:50.552
you wouldn't even
recognize who I used
to be 'cause it's...

16:50.576 --> 16:52.687
Ten years ago,
couldn't leave
the house.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.145
Yeah, exactly.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.658
You know what?
You deserve everything
and more.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.650
- Those days are
long gone, my dear.
- Say goodbye.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.296
- [laughter]
- [Lisa] Bye.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.965
We're here and we're
ready to shine
like a snowflake.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.401
[Lisa] That's right.
Let's go try on
the next dress.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.525
[Jenny] Let's go.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.137
Like, I don't know
where we're gonna
go from here,

17:09.161 --> 17:10.905
but show me some more magic.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.540
I will.
I definitely will.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.142
And the good news is,
we put this on first,

17:14.166 --> 17:16.177
- so now we use this
as our benchmark.
- Yeah.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.613
And if we don't like
anything more
than this, we know.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.182
- All right.
- Okay. We'll see you
in a minute.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.607
Okay.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.441
- That's very pretty.
- Yeah.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.061
Okay, so,
are you ready to
get started?

17:33.085 --> 17:34.896
- We wanna start
with this one, right?
- [Chloe] I do. Yeah.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.398
Okay, I'm excited
about this one.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.466
[Chloe]
<i>All three of them are</i>
<i>absolutely gorgeous.</i>

17:38.490 --> 17:41.202
<i>There's one in</i>
<i>particular that really</i>
<i>stands out to me.</i>

17:41.226 --> 17:45.196
<i>And being able</i>
<i>to be a bride</i>
<i>and, you know,</i>

17:45.230 --> 17:47.108
be somewhere
like Kleinfeld's
dress shopping

17:47.132 --> 17:49.100
is just a dream come true.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.914
For me, you know,
this is an amazing
experience

17:52.938 --> 17:54.549
'cause I was married
once before,

17:54.573 --> 17:58.443
before I transitioned,
and I was in a tuxedo.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.854
- Really?
- You know,
and it wasn't me.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.447
It's just never, like,
never felt right.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.925
It was never, like,
the wedding that

18:03.949 --> 18:05.883
I had always dreamt of having.

18:06.652 --> 18:07.819
It didn't feel right.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.297
I wasn't living my, you know,

18:09.321 --> 18:11.161
authentic life at that time.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.434
It's just...
It kind of got
to that point

18:12.458 --> 18:14.358
<i>where I didn't wanna live,</i>

18:15.127 --> 18:17.005
you know, a half-life anymore.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.339
And I don't know
how I just noticed,

18:18.363 --> 18:20.642
- but your tattoos are
absolutely beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.177
I'm a couple sessions away

18:22.201 --> 18:24.602
from finishing, like,
laser tattoo removal

18:24.636 --> 18:26.671
of, like, my ugly man tattoos.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.817
I just left
the military
this last year.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.008
<i>I served for 15 years.</i>

18:31.043 --> 18:33.621
<i>So, I've done a couple</i>
<i>of deployments</i>
<i>to Afghanistan.</i>

18:33.645 --> 18:37.081
I was wounded
during one of those
deployments.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.917
Received a Purple Heart
medal for that.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.696
<i>And it's a really</i>
<i>important part</i>
<i>of my past.</i>

18:41.720 --> 18:43.164
<i>It's something
I'm really proud of.</i>

18:43.188 --> 18:45.523
<i>But back then,
I never imagined that</i>

18:45.557 --> 18:47.335
this wedding would
come to fruition,

18:47.359 --> 18:50.695
and that I'd be
here today with
an amazing partner,

18:50.729 --> 18:54.165
you know,
living my best life
with her, so.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.977
A wedding dress,
like, when you're
getting married,

18:56.001 --> 18:57.178
it should feel like
you're in something

18:57.202 --> 18:58.780
that's like an elevated
version of you.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.081
- Right?
- Yeah, for sure.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.650
- Which maybe this
feels like that? Yeah?
- Yeah, I love this.

19:02.674 --> 19:03.908
Yeah, okay.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.987
This is really exciting
'cause it's really
her first time

19:06.011 --> 19:09.547
to really, like,
truly be herself.

19:09.581 --> 19:10.758
- Yes.
- [Randy]<i> Yeah.</i>

19:10.782 --> 19:14.085
So, I'm excited to
see how she feels
in a wedding dress

19:14.119 --> 19:17.088
and, you know, to feel beautiful

19:17.122 --> 19:19.457
and a woman, you know, fully.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.693
We're excited.
We're anxious.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.038
[Emily] Yeah, this is big.

19:24.062 --> 19:25.440
- Yay!
- Oh, yay!

19:25.464 --> 19:26.697
[laughter]

19:26.732 --> 19:28.109
-[Randy]
<i>Did she come out?</i>
-[women] Yes!

19:28.133 --> 19:29.410
Oh, let me see.
Let me meet her.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.736
- [women clapping]
- Oh, Chloe.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.071
- I'm gonna cry.
- [Sabrina] Ah, don't cry.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.007
Can I see her?
Hi, beautiful.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.108
Oh, hey.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.876
Oh, look at you.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.146
[Amber] Let's start with a bang.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.526
[Sabrina]
Work it, girl.
Work it.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.894
- Well done.
- It's beautiful.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.163
She brought it in
and I was like,
"That one."

19:48.187 --> 19:49.831
<i>It is absolutely perfect.</i>

19:49.855 --> 19:50.999
<i>It's everything I wanted.</i>

19:51.023 --> 19:53.024
<i>The detail work on it
is amazing.</i>

19:53.058 --> 19:55.193
<i>And I love the way I feel in it,</i>

19:55.227 --> 19:57.361
I love the way
that it fits my body.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.073
[Randy]
<i>You look amazing.</i>

19:59.097 --> 20:00.575
You can't say "yes" yet.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.134
[Kim] Yeah, we want
more than one dress.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.512
[Randy]<i> So, this is</i>
<i>the one to beat.</i>

20:04.536 --> 20:06.681
- This is the one
to beat, Randy.
- Okay.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.316
I told you, Amber's good.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.807
The pressure's on now.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.586
I know, right?
What do I
follow up with?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.570
- I don't know.
- [laughs] Good luck.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.823
I'm gonna let the train fly

20:15.847 --> 20:17.926
so you can feel
the weight of it, okay?

20:17.950 --> 20:20.910
- Oh, it's so great.
- [Chloe] I didn't
even feel it.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.991
- Well, that...
- That was a way to
make an entrance.

20:27.025 --> 20:30.194
That was a major, major hit.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.762
Yes, absolutely.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.477
- Okay.
- This is gonna be
hard to beat.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.145
- Yep, I know it is.
- But I'm challenging you.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.914
To be honest with you,
I don't think that
any of the dresses

20:39.938 --> 20:42.217
<i>in the room are</i>
<i>gonna make Jenny</i>
<i>feel as special</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:43.874
<i>as she feels right now,</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:44.919
or win her family over.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.244
So, you know what?
I gotta go
back in shop.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.916
Yeah, and it's over
$5,000, but... okay.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.518
She told me it was okay.

20:54.553 --> 20:58.256
It's over budget,
but Jenny did show me
a picture of it,

20:58.290 --> 20:59.701
so I'm going to bring it.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.436
But I'm gonna bring her one more

21:01.460 --> 21:02.971
that's totally different.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.162
Okay, I have some
dresses for you.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.632
[Jenny] Yay!
Oh, my gosh.

21:07.699 --> 21:11.402
- Okay, so this is that
Pronovias one...
- Yeah.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.647
That is out of your budget.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.115
- Yes, it is.
- That has very...

21:14.139 --> 21:15.883
"Out of your budget,
Jenny, remember."

21:15.907 --> 21:17.552
And very limited sparkle.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.320
- Yes.
- Has some, but limited.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.746
Then I found the most fabulous,

21:21.780 --> 21:24.820
I stumbled on it
when I was looking for
another one, dress

21:24.850 --> 21:27.818
by this designer
Rachel Gilbert
in your price point.

21:27.853 --> 21:32.089
- Ooh!
- It is so winter
wonderland magnificent.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.768
- Take a look.
- [Jenny] Oh, my gosh.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.059
[gasps] Whoa.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.904
- [Lisa] Do you like it?
- That's gorgeous.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.764
<i>Wow, this dress is so different,</i>

21:39.798 --> 21:41.142
it's just straight beading

21:41.166 --> 21:43.211
and it's gonna
be a shock factor,
I think.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.601
I want you to keep
your eyes closed

21:44.603 --> 21:48.439
'cause, I mean, I think
you're gonna think
you look... smashing.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.785
- [Jenny] Thank you.
- But I'm not sure that
it beats the other one.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.329
- Okay.
- Okay, you can
look now.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.179
Oh, my gosh!

21:56.648 --> 21:58.159
It is... It's stunning.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.284
But it doesn't feel bridal.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.988
I want to wear this
to the Grammys
someday.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.800
[Lisa] Can you
sing me like two lines

22:05.824 --> 22:07.535
while you're in
your Grammy dress.

22:07.559 --> 22:13.664
♪ <i>I'm gonna love you</i>
<i>Till my tank is empty ♪</i>

22:13.699 --> 22:19.370
♪ <i>Till I've given all</i>
<i>I've got and I can't</i>
<i>Love anymore ♪</i>

22:19.404 --> 22:21.316
- [chuckles]
- Oh, my God,
I have chills.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.542
This dress is just
too costumey feeling.

22:24.576 --> 22:27.021
It's too much, like,
Jenny Toleman
the entertainer,

22:27.045 --> 22:29.880
which I love,
but not for
my wedding day.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.116
[Lisa] So, where do
we go from here?

22:32.150 --> 22:34.729
We have the one
out of the budget,
this one.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.787
I warn you of one thing.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.133
-[Jenny chuckles] Okay.
-[Lisa] Okay?
You may love it.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.077
So, I mean, if you
love it more than
the other one,

22:42.861 --> 22:44.829
will you be okay with the price?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.797
'Cause that is the price.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.033
I know I'm breaking
the cardinal rule,

22:49.067 --> 22:51.802
but I just have to try it,

22:51.837 --> 22:55.306
if nothing more than
just to confirm that
I love this first dress.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.709
Yeah, no, I love
the first one. Yeah.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.154
<i>I don't think it's even worth</i>

23:00.178 --> 23:01.522
<i>going out and showing them</i>

23:01.546 --> 23:04.248
<i>because I feel like, in my gut,</i>

23:04.282 --> 23:07.017
<i>we already know
which dress I want.</i>

23:07.052 --> 23:08.062
[Lisa] Let's put
this one back on.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.597
I know, I'm just,
I've been waiting

23:09.621 --> 23:11.299
- this whole time
to put it back on.
- Me, too. Me, too.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.234
- Let's be honest.
- Yeah, exactly

23:13.258 --> 23:14.725
[all exclaiming]

23:14.760 --> 23:17.261
They put her in a fuller dress.

23:17.295 --> 23:19.055
What do you guys think?

23:19.598 --> 23:22.678
You don't seem as
excited about this one
as the other one.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.248
The first dress was so good...

23:37.282 --> 23:38.826
- [Chloe] Yeah.
- that we don't
wanna necessarily

23:38.850 --> 23:40.194
look for a copy-cat of this one.

23:40.218 --> 23:42.920
This is in a ballpark
of its own, right?

23:42.954 --> 23:44.298
So, let's show them
something different.

23:44.322 --> 23:45.962
- Okay?
- Okay, yep.

23:45.991 --> 23:49.326
So, this is a really
fun appointment.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.096
I mean, Amber and Mindy
have two brides

23:52.130 --> 23:54.509
that don't wanna
see each other in
their wedding gowns.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.244
So, they're gonna have
to figure out some way

23:56.268 --> 23:57.979
to kind of navigate
through the salon

23:58.003 --> 23:59.970
and not bump into each other.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.339
It's a fit and flare
dress underneath.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.885
- It is, okay.
- [Amber] Be fitted
to the body.

24:03.909 --> 24:07.411
And then, this has like
one layer of the tulle
over top of it.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.358
I'm really excited
to see what Chloe's
gonna come out in.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.982
<i>She's transgender,</i>

24:12.017 --> 24:15.853
<i>and for her</i>
<i>first wedding,</i>
<i>she wore a tuxedo,</i>

24:15.887 --> 24:19.824
so this is, like, the new Chloe.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.536
[Amber]
<i>I'm gonna put her</i>
<i>in an A-Line gown,</i>

24:21.560 --> 24:24.595
<i>but this A-Line</i>
<i>is also fitted</i>
<i>on the inside,</i>

24:24.629 --> 24:27.469
so it's gonna give
a little bit of
both worlds.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.910
-[Amber]
There you go.
-Perfect.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.812
Okay, how're you feeling?
Do you like this one?

24:30.836 --> 24:32.413
- I do like it,
a lot.
- Yeah?

24:32.437 --> 24:35.157
-Yeah.
-It's different right?
So, look...

24:35.207 --> 24:37.251
- fitted dress
underneath.
- Oh, wow.

24:37.275 --> 24:38.653
-[Amber]
It's different.
-[Chloe] Yeah.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.154
- I'm going for
something that's like...
- Oop.

24:40.178 --> 24:41.389
- I gotcha.
- [chuckles]

24:41.413 --> 24:42.379
Got your back.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.692
And you can
do this dress in
the honey color.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.228
- Okay.
- You don't have to
do it in all ivory.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.230
I don't have the same
feeling as I did
in the first one.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.421
Okay.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.891
I really like
the top of this dress
and the neckline.

24:53.925 --> 24:56.671
<i>It dips down</i>
<i>a little bit lower than</i>
<i>the last one I tried on,</i>

24:56.695 --> 25:00.498
<i>but I don't really</i>
<i>like the way it looks</i>
<i>around my waist.</i>

25:00.532 --> 25:03.372
And I feel like
I almost look
pregnant in it.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.203
[all exclaiming]

25:06.238 --> 25:07.404
[Amber] All right!

25:09.107 --> 25:11.475
Something different,
right? Dress No. 2.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.987
[Kim]
Yes, it's pretty

25:13.011 --> 25:14.812
I love the top of that.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.657
[Emily] Yes, I like the top.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.781
That is beautiful.

25:17.816 --> 25:20.150
They put her in a fuller dress.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.630
What do you guys think?

25:22.654 --> 25:24.999
You don't seem as
excited about this one
as the other one.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.123
I'm not.

25:26.157 --> 25:27.468
-[Emily] It's beautiful
-[Chloe] Yeah

25:27.492 --> 25:28.492
[Emily] Yeah.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.837
[Randy]<i> The waist needs to drop</i>

25:29.861 --> 25:32.106
a little lower
on this dress.
It's a little high.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.908
[Chloe] Randy,
did you say the waist
should be lower?

25:33.932 --> 25:35.476
- [Randy]<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>I think the waist is...</i>
- I agree.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.578
- that's what I said.
<i>- Too high on you,</i>
<i>I think it's,</i>

25:37.602 --> 25:39.069
it's looking almost...

25:39.104 --> 25:40.181
<i>I don't want to say this,</i>

25:40.205 --> 25:41.916
<i>but almost like</i>
<i>a maternity</i>
<i>kind of look.</i>

25:41.940 --> 25:43.251
- That's literally...
- What did I say?

25:43.275 --> 25:44.141
We were talking about it.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.943
I was like, oh, like...

25:45.977 --> 25:48.646
That's exactly what
we were talking about.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.491
You know, the moment
she walked out
in this dress,

25:50.515 --> 25:51.649
<i>you could just tell.</i>

25:51.683 --> 25:53.584
<i>She was not smiling</i>

25:53.618 --> 25:55.129
<i>and she didn't have
that confidence</i>

25:55.153 --> 25:56.831
<i>that she had in the first dress.</i>

25:56.855 --> 25:59.290
<i>So, when they walk out
and it's like that,</i>

25:59.324 --> 26:01.284
<i>you know it's not
the right dress.</i>

26:06.765 --> 26:09.210
- Oh, you're back
in that dress?
- [both chuckle]

26:09.234 --> 26:10.134
[Jenny] I'm back!

26:10.168 --> 26:14.204
We simply could
not find anything

26:14.239 --> 26:15.539
even close...

she was wanting.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.146
She was wanting
a higher neckline,

26:22.180 --> 26:24.515
and she was wanting
the long sleeves.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.318
[Jenny] And the buttons
down the back.

26:27.352 --> 26:31.755

No, you're right.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.865
I definitely think
since the last time
I tried on my dress,

29:17.889 --> 29:20.057
that I gained a little
bit of weight,

29:20.125 --> 29:23.694
not too much,
but enough to
make me nervous

29:23.728 --> 29:27.498

if my dress will
fit me today.

So, I always was
getting shamed
for how I looked,

29:39.277 --> 29:42.157
and I think it really
stuck with me
as an adult.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.192
I mean, I love my dress,

29:45.216 --> 29:47.228
- but I am a little
nervous that...
- Why?

29:47.252 --> 29:49.486
It's gonna be a little too snug.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.361
Oh, no, it's gonna be fine.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.402
[Danielle] Oh, my God,

29:55.426 --> 29:57.394
I feel anxious,

29:57.428 --> 30:00.931
I'm sweating.
I'm so afraid,

30:00.965 --> 30:02.805
that I'm gonna be embarrassed

30:02.834 --> 30:04.512

isn't gonna zip,

show in the dress.

Okay.

Okay.

- Of course it did.

for being overweight,

<i>and my confidence sometimes</i>

31:25.383 --> 31:27.751
<i>isn't as high as
I make it out to be.</i>

31:27.785 --> 31:31.989
And the fact that
my bridal gown made
me have a shape,

31:32.023 --> 31:35.225
and made me feel
as beautiful as
I ever felt,

31:35.260 --> 31:37.037

33:09.921 --> 33:13.041

flawless no matter
what you're wearing.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.464

33:23.501 --> 33:25.512
Honestly, I feel
really confident

are super pretty.</i>

33:49.093 --> 33:50.471
The way that they fall.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.562
I think it has potential,

33:52.597 --> 33:55.642
but I think their
reaction will really
help me indicate...

- if it's worth
consideration.

[Alayna]<i> We always</i>

<i>competitiveness between us,</i>

36:32.256 --> 36:34.268
and I'm super excited
that I said it first,

36:34.292 --> 36:35.335
but also at the same time,

36:35.359 --> 36:36.803
<i>there's that little
worry in my gut</i>

36:36.827 --> 36:39.987
<i>that's like "Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>What if she doesn't</i>
<i>find her dress?"</i>

I can't wait to get it on me.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.850

37:20.404 --> 37:21.871
[Chloe]<i> And,</i>

37:21.906 --> 37:23.517
you know, there was
a time in my life

37:23.541 --> 37:25.686
where, like,
I didn't think this day
would ever come.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.911
Just where we're at with society

37:27.945 --> 37:31.181
and kinda where I grew up.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.826
And I was, you know,

37:32.850 --> 37:34.117
had that fear that...

37:35.353 --> 37:38.822
I'd never get to,
you know, live
my authentic life.

37:38.856 --> 37:42.525
And, um,
to be here today,
you know,

37:42.559 --> 37:45.695
feeling amazing
in this gorgeous dress
at Kleinfelds.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.030
Like...

37:47.064 --> 37:49.744
-[Sabrina]
Making me cry.
-[Emily] Yeah.

37:50.167 --> 37:53.837
Not just, you know,
what I'm wearing
to the wedding,

37:53.871 --> 37:56.650
but just who I am
as a person is
different this time.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.218
<i>And I'm able to bring, like,</i>

37:58.242 --> 38:00.410
my whole self into
this relationship.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.322
[Randy]<i> It's a beautiful</i>
<i>thing to see when</i>

38:02.346 --> 38:05.715
somebody is able
to really express
who they are,

38:05.750 --> 38:07.494
and come out of their shell,

38:07.518 --> 38:09.129
and not have to hide
from the world.

38:09.153 --> 38:10.420
Can I hug my child?

38:10.454 --> 38:12.454
Yeah I want to...
I want to hug her.

38:13.991 --> 38:15.302
<i>I don't wanna cry again.</i>

38:15.326 --> 38:16.626
<i>Um, feel like I've...</i>

38:17.662 --> 38:18.972
cried enough for one day.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.498
Happy tears, but, uh...

38:22.166 --> 38:24.267
<i>I've got joy.</i>

38:24.302 --> 38:26.062
It's just a lot of joy.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.039
[exclaims]

38:29.073 --> 38:30.993
[Sabrina whispers]
Looks so good.

38:32.743 --> 38:35.455
-[Sabrina] Oh, my God.
-[Kim] I know, I know.
It's just...

38:35.479 --> 38:37.424

Oh, you look incredible.

38:39.684 --> 38:40.583

38:40.618 --> 38:41.995
[Randy]<i> Should we</i>
<i>ask the question?</i>

38:42.019 --> 38:44.699
-[Amber]
<i>You ready, Randy?</i>
-I'm ready.

38:47.358 --> 38:50.260
Chloe, are you saying
yes to the dress?

38:52.029 --> 38:53.749
- Yes!

38:57.335 --> 38:59.135
- Thank you.
- [Randy]<i> Yes!</i>

38:59.303 --> 39:01.214
So, you ended up
going with
your first dress?

39:01.238 --> 39:02.706
[Chloe]<i> I did, yeah.</i>

39:02.740 --> 39:05.141
<i>As soon as I put it on,
I just knew.</i>

39:05.176 --> 39:07.521
<i>And then,</i>
<i>when I walked out</i>
<i>and showed everyone,</i>

39:07.545 --> 39:09.156
<i>and saw their reaction,</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:10.657
<i>it just kinda
solidified it, too.</i>

39:10.681 --> 39:13.516
Congratulations.
I'm so happy
for both of you.

39:13.551 --> 39:16.631

39:20.591 --> 39:21.858
I feel amazing.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.804
I'm so excited
that we were
both able to find

39:23.828 --> 39:25.572
<i>our perfect dresses today.</i>

39:25.596 --> 39:27.356
Does it have white on it?

39:27.665 --> 39:29.209
No, it's purple and green.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.301
Perfect. [laughs]

39:48.085 --> 39:50.820
<i>I cried as soon as
I saw it this morning.</i>

39:50.855 --> 39:52.756
I can't wait to get it on me.

39:59.697 --> 40:02.657
Uh, probably most,
I think, I've ever
been in my life.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.647
Getting married
today means that
I found someone

40:07.671 --> 40:09.282
I was willing to
put my entire life to,

40:09.306 --> 40:11.408
someone that I love
more than myself.

40:13.511 --> 40:15.655
[Danielle]<i> I can't</i>

40:17.515 --> 40:18.725
<i>I'm definitely gonna cry.</i>

- You need to see
what you look like.
- All right.

40:22.353 --> 40:23.319
Wow!

40:23.354 --> 40:24.998
I wanted to get married
my whole life.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.757
- Yeah! You did it.
- [all cheering]

40:55.886 --> 40:58.231
Family and friends,

41:24.715 --> 41:27.427
promise to keep
supporting Chris'
love for sports

41:27.451 --> 41:29.129
and to continue listening to him

41:29.153 --> 41:31.798

his golf trips with
the guys?

41:33.157 --> 41:35.558
I have to.
[laughing]

I do.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.716
Please place the ring
on Danielle's finger.

41:49.740 --> 41:52.786
It's by the power
vested in me by
the State of New Jersey

41:52.810 --> 41:55.388
that I now
pronounce you
husband and wife.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.480

- [all cheering]

42:04.488 --> 42:06.633
I feel so happy

<i>I feel like my life
is finally complete,</i>

42:08.659 --> 42:10.971
