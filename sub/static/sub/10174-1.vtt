Abbo, party of two.

01:50.102 --> 01:52.102
Abbo.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.105
Oh, sorry. Do you mean "Abbi?"

01:55.190 --> 01:58.692
Your table's almost ready. But we can't
seat you unless you're all together.

01:58.777 --> 02:01.111
Unless you're here just by yourself.

02:01.196 --> 02:01.904
Aww.

02:02.048 --> 02:03.991
No, see? She's real.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.930
'Kay, I'll be right... Hey, dude.

02:06.083 --> 02:10.287
Hey, I'm sorry I was late. I got
into this depressing article matrix

02:10.372 --> 02:13.201
about these Saudi women who
have to ask their "keepers"

02:13.236 --> 02:15.027
permission to leave the house.

02:15.062 --> 02:16.176
Like, please.

02:16.295 --> 02:20.131
I just was so pissed, I had to blow
off some steam and masturbate first.

02:20.166 --> 02:22.549
Uh... Cool... Listen, we gotta
hurry up. We're gonna lose the table.

02:22.634 --> 02:24.004
- I've been waiting.
- Really sorry,

02:24.039 --> 02:26.436
you just would not have wanted
to see me if I hadn't masturbated.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.850
- Oh... no
- Oh... no!

02:28.885 --> 02:30.523
- Oh, no! You see it?
- Fuck.

02:30.642 --> 02:32.592
- I see it. It's right there.
- I want to jump in there.

02:32.627 --> 02:34.574
There's no... It's so deep.

02:34.765 --> 02:35.612
Ew!

02:35.697 --> 02:37.611
There's no way you're
gonna reach the bottom.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.568
Abbo!

02:41.653 --> 02:43.600
You want the table or not?

02:43.635 --> 02:45.488
Okay, we gotta go back
to these Saudi women.

02:45.574 --> 02:47.073
Dude, I can't even believe it.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.159
They need written permission
from their male guardians...

02:49.244 --> 02:51.962
That's what they call their husbands,
to let them go outside of their house.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.830
Like, they're trapped unless
they get written permission.

02:53.916 --> 02:55.548
- So fucked up.
- People don't know about this.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.251
They need to wake up to
the injustices of the world.

02:58.337 --> 02:59.082
Ugh!

02:59.122 --> 03:01.033
The bottomless mimosas
aren't on the menu anymore.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.505
- Are you kidding me?
- No, they're nowhere.

03:02.591 --> 03:04.507
- There was no sign. This is so unfair!
- God.

03:04.593 --> 03:06.343
- Sorry, we did not order sparkling water.
- No!

03:06.428 --> 03:07.560
It's complimentary.

03:07.679 --> 03:09.229
We'll have two more bottles, please.

03:09.348 --> 03:10.230
Thanks so much.

03:13.937 --> 03:16.365
New York is Europe. I love it.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.014
Every time I walk down
the street, I'm like...

03:20.292 --> 03:21.441
Do German.

03:21.526 --> 03:22.994
Loch! Ach!

03:23.133 --> 03:24.327
Australian.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.377
Oyuh!

03:25.412 --> 03:26.579
Spanish.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.532
Do Chinese.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.784
Are you kidding?

03:31.381 --> 03:32.335
No.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.872
- It's 2016, dude.
- No. That's my bad, I'm sorry.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.375
Anyway, so about tonight,
I want to get into the plan.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.057
- What's tonight?
- I told you last night.

03:40.092 --> 03:42.379
The gallery opening. My
roommate from college?

03:42.514 --> 03:44.431
Smelly pussy Donna?

03:44.549 --> 03:46.383
No, and I'm still sorry
that I told you that.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.719
No, my other roommate Max Anne. She
got her first painting in a gallery,

03:49.805 --> 03:53.390
she's been working forever,
and I read in TONY...

03:54.443 --> 03:55.608
- Time Out New York.
- Love it.

03:55.727 --> 03:57.610
That the warehouse sale is this weekend

03:57.729 --> 03:59.195
and I need to find
something cool to wear.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.313
No, you don't.

04:00.399 --> 04:03.361
You look sexy and vivacious and artsy

04:03.396 --> 04:06.956
and like, young wife material,
but, like, taut, and teasy still.

04:06.991 --> 04:08.321
It's a perfect combo.

04:08.503 --> 04:11.458
I mean, it's okay. It's, like, urban.

04:11.576 --> 04:14.077
- Like Urban Outfitters.
- Got it.

04:14.162 --> 04:15.578
Thank you.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.579
To my frond... To the ond.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.082
And to free sparkling water.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.971
Mmm... That's classy.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.225
Very.

04:26.945 --> 04:28.725
Dude, just trust me. Chill.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.144
- Come on.
- Gum is so repulsive.

04:31.263 --> 04:32.562
It is cow cud.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.181
You want the key back or not?

04:35.267 --> 04:36.266
Trust me.

04:36.351 --> 04:38.768
Here we go. Oh!

04:38.904 --> 04:40.987
Ugh! Ugh!

04:43.292 --> 04:44.823
Here we go.

04:44.858 --> 04:47.911
Oh, my God. Genie!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.412
You are a genius.

04:49.548 --> 04:51.464
This is Depression-era right here.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.083
- There it is.
- You see it? You're so close.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.072
- Okay, do you see?
- Yo, we got this.

04:55.107 --> 04:56.336
- It's right there.
- A little lower.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.837
- It's so close.
- Maybe like north...

04:57.850 --> 05:00.422
Ow! Oh

05:00.457 --> 05:01.510
Get off of me!

05:01.545 --> 05:03.059
- Get up!
- Oh, my God!

05:03.145 --> 05:04.010
- I got you!
- Dude!

05:04.096 --> 05:05.512
- What the fuck?
- What was that?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.930
What the fuck was that?

05:07.015 --> 05:08.715
- Was that a train?
- I don't know. I can't go like this.

05:08.869 --> 05:10.483
Well, now you have an
excuse to buy something.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.158
Honestly, that's the best way to
shop, desperate and in a time crunch.

05:14.193 --> 05:15.405
Well, what about the key?

05:15.490 --> 05:16.823
I'll figure it out.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.817
You know, having this 12-pound
chain around my waist for a few hours

05:19.852 --> 05:22.329
is nothing compared to
the metaphysical chains

05:22.447 --> 05:24.772
of those Saudi women
and their "keepers."

05:24.807 --> 05:27.382
Totally. All right, well, let's pee
first, you know, just to be safe.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.867
Oof, smart and sexy.

05:28.902 --> 05:30.882
She is unreal, this girl.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.874
She really is.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.426
Sorry, we don't have
any tables available.

05:36.511 --> 05:39.846
The next available table
is in about an hour.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.464
Oh, no, we're actually
just gonna use the bathroom.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.433
The bathroom is for customers only.

05:43.518 --> 05:45.435
We're customers. We just had brunch.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.687
So if you came here two months ago,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.973
that just makes you entitled to
piss here whenever you'd like?

05:50.058 --> 05:53.310
The next table is available
in an hour and 45 minutes.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.811
- You just said it was in an hour.
- Caught you, pretty girl.

05:55.846 --> 05:57.447
And even if it wasn't an hour,

05:57.532 --> 06:00.650
we will never be patrons
at this place ever again.

06:00.736 --> 06:04.988
Unless we're planning a birthday, because
the garden is perfect for large parties.

06:05.123 --> 06:06.623
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.375

Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

06:37.606 --> 06:39.189
We don't have bathrooms.

06:39.324 --> 06:40.490
We don't even have dressing rooms.

06:40.575 --> 06:42.359
This is a pop-up, bitch!

Oh, no!

06:55.574 --> 06:57.002
Does this look artsy to you?

Oh.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.551
Hey, do you love this hat?

07:08.728 --> 07:10.909
- Forget it, it's gone. Forget it.
- Okay.

07:10.944 --> 07:13.390
Is this perfect for tonight or what?

07:13.475 --> 07:16.192
Very much, yes.

07:16.278 --> 07:20.063
No doubt, though, by the quality some
nine-year-old girl was forced to work,

07:20.198 --> 07:22.877
day-in and day-out, she's
breathing in the fumes, you know,

07:22.912 --> 07:25.485
her little fingers perfect for sewing,
but also perfect for getting stuck

07:25.570 --> 07:27.012
in that sewing machine.

07:27.177 --> 07:28.488
It's 90% off.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.773
You know, if you don't buy
it, what was all of that for?

07:30.808 --> 07:31.491
All right, cool.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.817
- Yeah.
- Great.

07:32.917 --> 07:34.077
Mine!

07:34.162 --> 07:35.245
That's my old shirt.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.914
Yeah, sure it is, bitch.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.166
- What?
- I don't like the energy here.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.657
Jeez.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.755
Man, someone was just telling
me about this crazy article.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.924
- Yeah.
- By someone, I mean the Internet.

07:48.060 --> 07:51.261
Oh, my God. They forgot to
take the security tag off.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.159
Fuck.

07:52.251 --> 07:53.863
Come on!

07:53.898 --> 07:55.763
Fine, we have to go back, dude.

07:55.831 --> 07:57.517
Why does this fuck always
happen to me? It's like...

07:57.602 --> 07:58.910
I don't know.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.990
My therapist doesn't know either.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.446
What the fuck?

08:09.531 --> 08:12.365
My therapist is gonna love this one.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.701
Jeez.

08:14.633 --> 08:16.549
Oh, God, I gotta go so bad.

08:16.635 --> 08:18.551
- Yeah, me too.
- You know what? I'm just gonna pee here.

08:18.637 --> 08:20.758
I can't wait anymore.

08:28.762 --> 08:30.831
Hi. How you doing?

08:31.399 --> 08:34.363
Squats... Um, unlock the hips.

08:36.488 --> 08:37.953
- See that?
- Yeah.

08:38.073 --> 08:40.957
God, cops scare the fuck
out of me, and I'm white.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.460
Oh, it's Lincoln.

08:44.579 --> 08:46.441
You take it. I'm gonna go into the
store  and see if they can take this off.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.439
Cool.

08:47.474 --> 08:48.965
- Hey, bwa.
- Hey, grah.

08:49.084 --> 08:49.916
You coming?

08:50.001 --> 08:50.879
Not yet.

08:50.914 --> 08:52.135
Say something filthy.

08:52.253 --> 08:54.676
Ilana, did you forget
my graduation is today?

08:55.924 --> 08:56.889
No.

08:57.088 --> 08:59.842
Na... We're close, on our... very way.

09:00.055 --> 09:01.799
- All right.
- Cool, see you soon. Bye.

09:04.649 --> 09:05.598
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

09:05.684 --> 09:06.981
Yeah, uh, pretty good.

09:07.016 --> 09:08.805
Also, they think I stole
this, the cops are coming.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.653
Alright, got it.

09:10.772 --> 09:11.938
- Okay.
- All right.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.073
And I am boarding.

09:14.159 --> 09:16.442
- Okay, and I am...
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:16.578 --> 09:17.443
- Boarding.
- Boarding.

09:17.479 --> 09:19.086
- I'm aboard.
- Aboard.

09:19.447 --> 09:22.281
A few steps, a few steps,
and then we start a pedal.

09:22.417 --> 09:26.285
One second. Few steps, and
then we start a'pedaling.

09:26.421 --> 09:30.289

18:45.355 --> 18:47.597
Maybe if I just, like, pull the fabric?

18:47.632 --> 18:49.073
Like, we gotta get this off.

18:49.159 --> 18:51.409
You know what... My teeth.
My teeth are huge, come on.

18:51.494 --> 18:52.944
Huge and sharp.

18:53.079 --> 18:54.779
Shh, shh!

18:57.617 --> 18:59.617
No!

19:03.373 --> 19:05.823
Sh... She didn't steal it.

19:05.909 --> 19:06.870
Get out!

19:06.873 --> 19:09.761
No, Max Anne, no. Come on. Come on.

19:09.846 --> 19:11.262
How could you?

19:11.348 --> 19:12.630
No, Max Anne...

19:12.766 --> 19:14.432
- Get out!
- No!

19:14.517 --> 19:16.434
Stop touching it and go!

19:16.519 --> 19:18.016
Okay.

19:18.051 --> 19:19.137
I...

19:19.222 --> 19:21.806
Go!

19:21.891 --> 19:23.524
Go faster!

19:25.645 --> 19:27.812
So sorry.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.771
- Of course.
- Ilana... Get off the balls.

19:33.036 --> 19:34.485
It is a magnet.

19:34.621 --> 19:35.787
Help me now.

19:35.872 --> 19:36.988
Get off of it.

19:37.073 --> 19:39.040
Use your upper body strength.

19:39.159 --> 19:41.429
Help her get off of it and go!

19:41.825 --> 19:43.878
Oh!

19:47.884 --> 19:49.584
Okay.

19:49.669 --> 19:51.169
Okay.

19:51.304 --> 19:54.889
You don't need to steady it, just go.

19:55.008 --> 19:56.507
Go!

19:56.593 --> 19:57.842
You're a bitch!

19:57.927 --> 20:00.011
Congrats.

20:05.989 --> 20:11.325
♪♪

20:11.461 --> 20:13.121
Let's do this.

20:14.497 --> 20:17.370
It's hard for me not
to feel sexual at all.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.952
Ilana, can you just, like, suck
your titties in a little bit?

20:21.987 --> 20:23.924
If I had control over
my titties like that,

20:23.959 --> 20:25.880
I'd make them the same size.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.676
Come on, gravity, you fucking bitch!

20:29.064 --> 20:30.332
Come on!

20:30.367 --> 20:31.312
Oh, come on!

20:31.397 --> 20:33.014
- We are so close.
- God!

20:33.099 --> 20:35.566
- Jesus, Ab!
- I'm trying, I mean...

20:35.685 --> 20:38.319
I mean, my hand's in.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.278
- Okay. I got it, Yes!'s coming.
- Oh, it's happening.

20:40.313 --> 20:42.363
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

20:43.869 --> 20:46.100
- God!
- Jesus!

20:47.765 --> 20:49.701
Tell me that isn't sexual.

20:50.265 --> 20:52.001
You're bleeding, dude.
