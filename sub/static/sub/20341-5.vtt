04:58.250 --> 04:59.625
Hey, I have a question.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.458
How much stuff
does Ruff-Ruff

05:01.458 --> 05:04.000
need the stuffing machine
to stuff?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.416
Ruff-Ruff needs just enough
stuff to stuff him up

05:06.416 --> 05:07.875
so he's stuffed.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.250
That's a lot of stuff
for Ruff-Ruff.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.166
Whoa! That's way too stuffed.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.125
(hissing)

05:14.125 --> 05:16.125
It's a stuffing storm!

05:16.125 --> 05:18.750
Ruff-Ruff, come back!

05:18.750 --> 05:21.208
-Huh!
-Whoa!

05:21.208 --> 05:22.000
Huh!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.833
(squeaking)

05:26.750 --> 05:28.250
(both grunting)

05:29.250 --> 05:32.125
Now it's time
to sew this puppy up!

05:32.125 --> 05:33.500
(machine whirs)

05:33.500 --> 05:36.291
But we're gonna need
some kid power to do it.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.583
Chloe?

05:40.875 --> 05:43.458
Sunny:
You can pedal

05:43.458 --> 05:45.583

This is fun!

05:45.583 --> 05:46.708
I'm sewing!

05:47.875 --> 05:50.166
And it looks like
it's all done!

05:51.750 --> 05:55.125
Wow! That looks...
sew good! (laughs)

05:55.125 --> 05:57.833
And there's just
one more thing to do
with this doggy,

05:57.833 --> 05:59.583
so follow me!

06:03.416 --> 06:06.416
That lady said this machine
runs on kid power.

06:06.416 --> 06:09.458
You think it'll work
with Bingo and Rolly power, too?

06:09.458 --> 06:12.333
Everything works
with Bingo and Rolly power!

06:12.333 --> 06:15.083
Okay, when I go down,
you go up.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.250
And when you go up,
I'll go down!

06:17.250 --> 06:18.750
(both grunting)

06:20.083 --> 06:23.083
We're doing it!
We're sewing that puppy up!

06:23.083 --> 06:25.750
Faster, Bingo, faster!

06:25.750 --> 06:28.166
Too fast, Bingo, too fast!

06:28.166 --> 06:29.875
Both:
Ooh!

06:33.458 --> 06:36.583
I think we used too much
Bingo and Rolly power.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.958

can be a dangerous thing.

06:39.958 --> 06:42.833
(whirs down)

06:47.083 --> 06:49.166
But at least we got
Ruff-Ruff sewed up.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.000
Now let's get him groomed!

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And now it's time
to get our doggy
looking dog-tacular!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.750
First, we get him clean...

06:58.750 --> 07:02.208
then we give him some style...

07:02.208 --> 07:05.750
and then we give him
some bling!

07:05.750 --> 07:07.250
And there we go!

07:07.250 --> 07:11.000
Now who's ready to pick out
a doggy of their own?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.375
-Ooh, I am!
-Me!

07:12.375 --> 07:14.375
-I want a pretty one!
-Let's get Ruff-Ruff cleaned,

07:14.375 --> 07:17.291
styled and blinged
before we take him back to Bob!

07:19.125 --> 07:22.375
And we might as well
get ourselves looking good, too.

07:24.708 --> 07:27.166
Here comes the cleaning!

07:27.166 --> 07:30.000
(fan whirring)

07:30.000 --> 07:32.250
What are you smiling about?

07:32.250 --> 07:35.125
I didn't know I was smiling.

07:35.125 --> 07:38.208
-(machine humming)
-(giggling)
That tickles!

07:38.208 --> 07:39.958
Oh, yeah, right there.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.083
I like that color.
It matches my eyes.

07:48.333 --> 07:52.083
We did it, Rolly.
Bob's toy looks as good
as it ever did.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.125
And we look
kind of dog-tacular ourselves.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.166
(whimpers)

08:07.500 --> 08:08.875
(barking)

08:13.416 --> 08:16.458
Okay, Rolly.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.000
Let's get Ruff-Ruff back home

08:18.000 --> 08:20.166
and back in the box
we took him out of.

08:21.750 --> 08:22.875
(barks)

08:24.500 --> 08:28.000
Okay, it's time
for the tea-pup party!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.500

a stuffed doggy!

08:30.500 --> 08:32.000

08:32.000 --> 08:33.875
Chloe:
This one is my favorite!

08:33.875 --> 08:36.166
Amanda:
I want two different doggies!

08:36.166 --> 08:40.875
Come on!
Let's go get our doggies
dressed to impress!

08:40.875 --> 08:42.625
Hang in there
until we know what's happening.

08:42.625 --> 08:46.083
Yeah, 'cause I don't know
what's happening at all!

08:46.083 --> 08:48.833
(classical score playing)

08:48.833 --> 08:51.000
Rolly! They think we're toys!

08:51.000 --> 08:53.875
Yeah. But they dressed us up
so nice for their party,

08:53.875 --> 08:56.000
we should stick around
just to be polite.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.416
Sunny:
Who's ready to feed
their Design-a-Dog doggies

08:58.416 --> 09:01.500
-biscuits and tea?
-Kids: Me!

09:01.500 --> 09:04.833
And who's ready
to gobble 'em up? Me!

09:05.833 --> 09:07.750
Eat up, you pretty
toy doggy.

09:07.750 --> 09:11.125
Nummy, nummy, num-nums!

09:11.125 --> 09:14.875
Pretend food?
Let me tell you something,
that's no party!

09:14.875 --> 09:16.333
And pretend tea?

09:16.333 --> 09:19.208
Drink your tea,
fancy doggy.
(mimics slurping)

09:19.208 --> 09:21.208
Gulp, gulp, gulp.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.958

They need better food
at their parties,

10:59.708 --> 11:01.250
but I'd come back.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.458
Hissy:
Nice work, pups.

11:08.458 --> 11:11.000
This thing looks amazing!

11:11.000 --> 11:13.833
Yep, Bob won't even know
we took it out of the box.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.333
-Hey, guys!
-(barks)

11:15.333 --> 11:18.166
Give me a minute
before I say hello, okay?

11:18.166 --> 11:22.708
I just need
to put this stuff outside--
oh, hey there, neighbors.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.208
Hi, Mr. Bob.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.958
What've you got there?

11:26.958 --> 11:30.166
I'm leavin' this old box
of toys out here for someone

11:30.166 --> 11:31.833
who's comin' by
to pick them up.

11:31.833 --> 11:35.875
Hey! That looks just like
the doggy from my party!

11:35.875 --> 11:38.208
You're just
giving this stuff away?

11:38.208 --> 11:40.250
To anybody who wants it!

11:40.250 --> 11:42.000
(gasps)
I want it!

11:42.000 --> 11:44.833
Can I keep him, Mommy,
Please?

11:44.833 --> 11:47.208
If Mr. Bob says it's okay.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.708
Ha! Sure!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.833
Yaay! Mmmm!

11:50.833 --> 11:51.958
(kisses)

11:51.958 --> 11:54.583
Look at that!
Chloe got the toy
that she wanted!

11:54.583 --> 11:57.875
So it's a good thing
we got it stuffed and sewed
and groomed that way...

11:57.875 --> 12:01.083
Both:
♪ At Design-a-Dog today ♪
(bark)

12:01.083 --> 12:05.208
I'm glad I found someone
to give Ruff-Ruff to,

12:05.208 --> 12:07.708
because I don't need
a pretend doggy anymore.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.000
I have two of the best
real ones!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.291
(both barking)

12:12.291 --> 12:13.875
Hoo-raay!

12:17.250 --> 12:19.291
(Bingo speaks)

12:25.416 --> 12:27.416
Hissy:
What are those two doing?

12:27.416 --> 12:32.208
Rolly is seeing how long
he can balance food on his nose
before eating it!

12:35.083 --> 12:37.333
That's twice as long
as he lasted the last time!

12:37.333 --> 12:38.708
(door opens)

12:38.708 --> 12:40.291
Hey, guys!
(laughs)

12:40.291 --> 12:43.208
I finished mowing the backyard
for you to play in.

12:43.208 --> 12:47.458
Now I just wanna pour myself
a big glass of iced tea
before I leave--

12:47.458 --> 12:48.625
(gasp)

12:48.625 --> 12:52.208
Oh no!
I'm all out of ice.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.250
How's a guy supposed
to have a glass of iced tea

12:54.250 --> 12:56.125
if he doesn't have any ice?

12:57.583 --> 13:00.166
Well, I guess I'll just
have to try not to think
about iced tea

13:00.166 --> 13:03.750
until I get home from work.

13:03.750 --> 13:09.166
Iced tea!
D'oh, I can't stop thinking
about delicious iced tea!

13:09.166 --> 13:11.083
-I wish we knew where to go...
-(door opens, closes)

13:11.083 --> 13:12.583
...to get Bob the ice
he needs for ice tea.

13:12.583 --> 13:16.458
Arf can show you
the best place in the world
to find the best ice.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.458
(beeping)

13:18.458 --> 13:20.375
It's a place called Antarctica,

13:20.375 --> 13:22.708
way down at the bottom
of the Earth.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.250
-Cool!
-It's more than cool.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.833
It's cold!

13:31.708 --> 13:33.166
Doesn't matter where it is.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.500
If it's got what Bob needs,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.166
then Rolly and I need
to be there.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.708
Come on, Rolly!
You and I are goin'
on a mission!

13:39.708 --> 13:41.125
Cool!

13:41.125 --> 13:43.750
I mean, cold!

13:49.208 --> 13:53.125
How are we supposed
to get to that Antarctica place
Arf showed us on the wall?

13:53.125 --> 13:54.875
I don't know.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.875
Okay now, I've got this crate
filled up with supplies

13:56.875 --> 13:59.708
for Antarctica.
You tell the pilot
to head there.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.583
Looks like
we found our ride.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.000
(grunting)

14:07.708 --> 14:09.500
Hey! We got a window seat!

14:13.291 --> 14:16.333
Bingo:
Put your tray tables up
in preparation for landing.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.083
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

14:22.833 --> 14:26.166
Which of this ice
do you think would be best
for Bob's iced tea?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.125
I don't know.
Maybe we should ask
those penguins

14:28.125 --> 14:29.708
that are sliding
right toward us.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.458
Sliding right toward who?

14:35.333 --> 14:38.291
-Hey!
-Bingo: It looks like
these penguins wanna race.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.583
Then they picked the right dogs
to knock over.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.125
Both:
Whoa! Whooo!

14:44.125 --> 14:46.000
Whoa!

14:47.250 --> 14:49.125
Yeah-ha! Whoa!

14:49.125 --> 14:50.333
Look at them go!

14:53.125 --> 14:54.958
Both:
Whoa!

14:54.958 --> 14:56.000
(both grunting)

14:57.375 --> 15:00.166
(penguins muttering)

15:00.166 --> 15:01.583
I think we tied for first place.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.291
Well, that was
some good slidin'.

15:04.291 --> 15:07.708
But what are you two doggies
doin' at the bottom
of the Earth?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.083
We're on a mission,
lookin' for ice.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.958
Huh, well, you're talkin'
to the right penguin.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.708
I can go find you
the best ice there is.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.083
You'd do that for us?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.875
Well, sure, I'll just need
to get ya to watch somethin'

15:18.875 --> 15:21.708
for me until I get back.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.416
You see, my little baby's
about to hatch outta this egg,

15:24.416 --> 15:28.208
which, needs to be kept
off the ice till it hatches.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.458
You've been walkin' around
with that thing under there?

15:30.458 --> 15:32.291
How do you do that
without slipping and sliding

15:32.291 --> 15:33.291
all over the ice?

15:33.291 --> 15:36.708
Well, I waddle.
That's how we penguins
don't fall down

15:36.708 --> 15:39.125
when everything's
so slippery and slidey.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.333
Let me show ya how it's done.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.958

16:25.125 --> 16:27.458
Uh, what's going on?

16:27.458 --> 16:30.708
(laughs)
We get storms here
that blow everything around

16:30.708 --> 16:32.708
and turn everything white.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.291
Rolly:
That's really white!

16:34.291 --> 16:35.958
Bingo:
Rolly, where are you?

16:35.958 --> 16:38.000
Over here!
Where are you?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.500
I'm looking for you!

16:39.500 --> 16:42.375
Rolly:
How long do you think
this big storm is gonna last?

16:42.375 --> 16:44.458
Bingo:
I don't know!
It could be forever!

16:46.875 --> 16:49.583
Or... not forever at all.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.833
Where did Mr. Penguin go?

16:51.833 --> 16:55.458
Well, he said he was going
to go find us the best ice,

16:55.458 --> 16:58.458
so he must have gone
to do it.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.833
And he asked us to watch that
while he was gone.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.708
Didn't he say that thing
was supposed to be kept
off the ice?

17:03.708 --> 17:06.250
Yep. So let's make sure
that it is.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.208
There! Off the ice
and toasty warm.

17:11.208 --> 17:15.625
(shivering)
I wish we were
warm and toasty.

17:15.625 --> 17:19.250
Well, then, let's see
what else is in this box.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.250
-I want a red one!
-I like blue.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.125
-I feel warm!
-And I feel toasty.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.083
Aren't we supposed
to be watching that egg

17:28.083 --> 17:31.000
until Mr. Penguin
finds the ice he went
looking for?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.208
Yeah, so we can't
let it get away!

17:34.625 --> 17:36.250
It's going into that cave!

17:36.250 --> 17:37.875
Then so are we!

17:37.875 --> 17:40.083
(ice squeaking)

17:41.625 --> 17:44.125
-Whoops!
-Whoa!

17:44.125 --> 17:46.708
-Ooh!
-Whoa!

17:49.250 --> 17:54.208
Uh, I don't remember
Mr. Penguin's egg being broken
when we followed it in here.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.166
Because it wasn't.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.000
There's something
under that hat.

17:59.708 --> 18:02.833
-(baby laughing)
-Bingo: It's a baby penguin!

18:02.833 --> 18:05.208
-(laughing)
-That egg must have hatched,

18:05.208 --> 18:06.708
and the baby penguin
popped out!

18:06.708 --> 18:09.458
(laughing)

18:09.458 --> 18:12.375
We should go looking
for her dad so we can show him
his new daughter.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.958
Yeah, and we can see
if he found Bob's ice.

18:14.958 --> 18:17.875
But wait. What if he follows
her tracks and comes
into this cave,

18:17.875 --> 18:19.375
thinking we're here?

18:19.375 --> 18:22.250
We'll draw an arrow in the ice
on the wall so he knows
which way we went.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.958
That's a great idea.

18:24.958 --> 18:28.333
So it's a good thing
Bob put this ice-drawing thing
in my collar,

18:28.333 --> 18:31.125
in case I ever needed
to draw something in ice.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.125
(giggles)

18:33.083 --> 18:35.083
Draw a big smiley face, too,

18:35.083 --> 18:37.166
so Mr. Penguin will know
we were smiling.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.291
(crackling)

18:46.750 --> 18:48.958
I think I smiley-faced too hard.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.458
(crackling, rumbling)

18:54.875 --> 18:57.291
Rolly:
I hope we're not trapped
in here.

18:57.291 --> 19:01.250
We can get through this
if we think of the icicles
like a maze.

19:01.250 --> 19:04.083
Except that baby penguin
already made it through.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.083
Come back, baby penguin!

19:06.083 --> 19:08.250
We've gotta get outta here.
Come on!

19:14.583 --> 19:16.583
-This way!
-I already went that way!

19:17.875 --> 19:19.125
Bingo:
Okay, go that way.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.291
Rolly:
But that way doesn't
go the right way!

19:26.583 --> 19:28.208
I found the way out!

19:28.208 --> 19:29.458
(both grunt)

19:30.875 --> 19:32.166
We did it!

19:32.166 --> 19:33.291
Let's go!

19:35.208 --> 19:36.708
(sniffing)

19:38.166 --> 19:39.083
There she is!

19:39.083 --> 19:40.875
(happy sounds)

19:40.875 --> 19:43.208
-Whoops!
-Whoa!

19:43.208 --> 19:44.291
How are we gonna get to her?

19:44.291 --> 19:46.625
This ice is
so slippery and slidey.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.833
We should waddle.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.500
That's what Mr. Penguin
said penguins do

19:49.500 --> 19:50.750
so they don't fall down.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.416
Yeah! Waddle like a penguin!

19:52.416 --> 19:54.000
Waddle, waddle, waddle!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.875
Don't go too far,
little penguin.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.416
We're waddle-waddle-waddling
as fast as we can!

19:58.416 --> 20:00.250
(ice cracking)

20:00.250 --> 20:02.250
Hm, that was
a pretty loud crack.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.125
Nothing on me has ever
gone crack like that.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.750
It wasn't you!
It was the ice cracking!

20:06.750 --> 20:09.083
It broke off and we're floating
out on the water!

20:09.083 --> 20:11.083
But I don't wanna be floating
on ice out on the water!

20:11.083 --> 20:13.833
We'll be okay.
As long as we stick together.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.250
(cracking noise)

20:15.250 --> 20:16.458
(yelps)

20:16.458 --> 20:18.333
Except we're coming apart!

20:20.625 --> 20:21.708
Jump!

20:22.875 --> 20:24.250
(both grunting)

20:24.250 --> 20:26.458
We made it!
Champion ice jumpers!

20:26.458 --> 20:28.875
Yeah!

20:28.875 --> 20:31.583
Oh, no. This ice
isn't floaty enough

20:31.583 --> 20:33.875
to hold two dogs
and a baby penguin!

20:33.875 --> 20:35.208
What are we gonna do?

20:35.208 --> 20:37.000
(squeaks)

20:40.375 --> 20:42.875
Well, look who's right here!

20:44.250 --> 20:45.291
Mr. Penguin!

20:45.291 --> 20:48.000
I found the ice
you were lookin' for!

20:48.000 --> 20:49.458
Do you have my egg?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.416
We have something
even better!

20:51.416 --> 20:54.083
(giggles) Da-da.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.208
Look at that!
It's my little girl!

20:57.208 --> 20:59.583
And she has her mother's beak!

20:59.583 --> 21:00.875
(laughing)

21:00.875 --> 21:02.291
They look happy
to see each other.

21:02.291 --> 21:04.291
I'm happy they're seeing
each other, too.

21:04.291 --> 21:07.000
Oh, you boys did
a great job

21:07.000 --> 21:09.583
watchin' my egg
and taking care
of my little girl

21:09.583 --> 21:11.583
while I went out
lookin' for your ice.

21:11.583 --> 21:14.166
Thanks! If you show us
where it is,

21:14.166 --> 21:17.250
we'll take it
and get it back to Bob
for his iced tea.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.166
But you already found it.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.250
That's why I came here.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.208
That ice you was standin' on?

21:23.208 --> 21:25.500
It's the best ice
in the world.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.333
(happy sounds)

21:31.416 --> 21:34.000
Go ahead.
Take all you want.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
But, I don't think that'll fit
in Bob's glass for his ice tea.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.625
Oh, I can take care
of that.

21:39.625 --> 21:40.708
(crackling)

21:43.000 --> 21:44.583
Now it'll fit for sure!

21:46.083 --> 21:48.625
(laughing)

21:48.625 --> 21:50.416
So long, baby penguin.

21:52.208 --> 21:54.000
We'd love to stay here
and play with you,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.625
but my brother and I
have to get home
as fast we can!

21:59.291 --> 22:01.250
Whoa! (grunts)

22:01.250 --> 22:03.208
(laughing)

22:03.208 --> 22:05.208
Probably a good thing
I'm not a penguin.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.875
I'd never get anywhere!

22:09.125 --> 22:11.083
-Wha--
-Ah-ah-ah-oh!

22:12.208 --> 22:14.416
How were things
on the bottom
of the Earth?

22:14.416 --> 22:17.000
Cold. Icy.
Helps if you waddle.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.083
Oh. Did you get the ice
Bob needs for his iced tea?

22:20.083 --> 22:21.208
We sure did!

22:22.416 --> 22:24.625
Except Bob wanted them
in his glass,

22:24.625 --> 22:26.000
not on the floor.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.083
Whoops.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.250
It's okay.
Arf will clean up the mess.

22:34.291 --> 22:36.250
Is there more ice in yours?

22:36.250 --> 22:37.958
Yep. The best there is!

22:37.958 --> 22:40.166
Here. (grunt)

22:41.833 --> 22:44.416
Good idea, Hissy.
Fill 'er up!

22:45.708 --> 22:49.083
There's my favorite
cat, dogs, and robot dog!

22:49.083 --> 22:51.000
(laughs)
How were your days?

22:51.000 --> 22:55.458
-(barking)
-Wait a minute.
There's ice in that glass?

22:55.458 --> 22:59.708
(laughs)
This is perfect for the iced tea
I've been wanting all day!

23:01.750 --> 23:04.458
Oh, this is gonna taste
so good!

23:08.708 --> 23:10.333
Does this mean
we finished our mission?

23:10.333 --> 23:12.708
Yep. Race ya
to the backyard?

23:12.708 --> 23:13.875
Beat ya there!

23:13.875 --> 23:14.958
Whoa!

23:14.958 --> 23:16.291
(grunt)

23:16.291 --> 23:19.125
How about if we race there
by waddling instead?

23:19.125 --> 23:20.458
I love waddling!

23:23.416 --> 23:25.208
-Waddle, waddle, waddle!
-Waddle, waddle!

23:26.458 --> 23:28.625
(both laughing)

23:32.166 --> 23:35.750
(theme music playing)

23:35.750 --> 23:36.875
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.208
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.458 --> 23:46.125
(record scratching)

23:52.125 --> 23:53.291
Bark!

23:56.875 --> 23:58.000
Bark! Bark! Bark!
