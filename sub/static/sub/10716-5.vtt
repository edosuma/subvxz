WEBVTT

00:14.482 --> 00:16.084
I'll make it up to you.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.552
I've got a hook up
with a guy

00:17.552 --> 00:20.454
who'll get us a table
at Mozza.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.856
I'll call you tonight, baby.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.129
Please, baby.
I know a guy.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.463
Remember to get us
a gas card,

00:29.463 --> 00:30.699
or you too busy
making plans

00:30.699 --> 00:32.366
to get your ashes hauled
when you get back?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.035
See, Harry,
if you wasn't such a
fuckin' monk,

00:34.035 --> 00:35.570
you'd know what it's
like out there.

00:35.570 --> 00:38.907
It takes a lot of
maintenance. Yes,
I got the gas card.

00:38.907 --> 00:41.475
Then let's get goin' or
we're crossin' the desert
at high noon.

00:42.577 --> 00:45.614
Hold up.
Bosch.

00:45.614 --> 00:47.281
When?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.317
Send him back.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.086
- Nash.
- Wants to tell us
he solved the case?

00:52.086 --> 00:53.054
Hm.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.859
Carl.

00:57.859 --> 00:59.160
Wish you'd called.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.029
Gettin' ready to
hit the road for Vegas.

01:01.029 --> 01:02.631
- Picking up your guy?
- The extradition hearing's

01:02.631 --> 01:03.832
first thing
tomorrow morning.

01:03.832 --> 01:05.299
Yeah, that's sort of
why I came in

01:05.299 --> 01:07.335
- if you've got a minute.
- A minute, sure.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.302
Yeah.
Someplace private?

01:12.540 --> 01:15.276
Grab a seat.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.145
Yeah, the other day...

01:17.145 --> 01:22.350
when you were asking me
about Tony Allen--

01:22.350 --> 01:23.351
Yeah.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.388
What's on your mind?
What'd you leave out?

01:27.388 --> 01:31.192
Okay. About six months ago
I'm doing my rounds.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.662
It's a nice evening,
windows down,

01:33.662 --> 01:35.697
I roll past
the Allen's house,

01:35.697 --> 01:37.265
I hear voices.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.534
An argument. Two men,
sounds like it could
get out of hand.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.170
So you thought you'd
check it out.

01:42.170 --> 01:46.040
Yeah. So I park.
I walk down the side of
the Allen's house,

01:46.040 --> 01:47.976
Allen and this other guy
are in--

01:47.976 --> 01:51.445
looks like a home office,
goin' at it.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.546
What about?
Could you tell?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.248
Money.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.417
The other guy's like,
"Where's my money, Tone?"

01:56.417 --> 01:57.719
over and over,
and Allen's like,

01:57.719 --> 01:59.520
"Oh, I wouldn't
do that to ya, I swear."

01:59.520 --> 02:01.222
Other guy,
he sign in at the gate?

02:01.222 --> 02:05.593
I checked the log.
There were no visitors for
the Allens that night.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.195
So he must have
come in with Tony.

02:07.195 --> 02:10.298
So why are you
tellin' me this now?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.500
You said there'd been
an arrest in Vegas.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.504
I was-- started thinkin',
yeah, we talked about
made guys, mob guys.

02:16.504 --> 02:20.241
I just remembered this guy
Allen had the fight with.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.476
I mean, he had that vibe,
the, you know--

02:22.476 --> 02:24.779
- Vegas wise guy.
- Absolutely, definitely.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.347
Mobster all the way.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.217
Think you could
pick him out of a six pack?

02:29.217 --> 02:31.419
Yeah, I think I could.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.386
Follow me.

02:34.723 --> 02:36.725
Nah.
It's none of these guys.

02:36.725 --> 02:38.092
- You sure?
- Yeah.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.530
That's the guy.
That's the guy!

02:42.530 --> 02:43.564
You sure about that?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.499
No doubt.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.201
Okay, we'll check it out.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.837
- Really appreciate it, Carl.
- Thanks.

02:48.837 --> 02:51.105
Am I-- Am I right?
He's a made guy?

02:51.105 --> 02:54.375
We talk to him,
we'll ask him about that.

02:54.375 --> 02:58.246
Okay.
I-- I should shove off.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.749
- Uh, good luck in Vegas.
- Thanks.

03:00.749 --> 03:01.950
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming in.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.184
Yeah, safe travel.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.360
Joey Marks.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.167

03:40.088 --> 03:42.623

04:23.631 --> 04:24.899
We got time for this?

04:24.899 --> 04:26.567
Check in's not 'til 3:00.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.568
Is it worth it?
We got Rykoff.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.837
On a platter.

04:28.837 --> 04:31.705
Your Christmas pig.
Courtesy of the FBI.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.142
Feds got it all worked out.

04:34.142 --> 04:35.509
Rykoff will give them Marks,

04:35.509 --> 04:37.478
and Marks will give them
something on the Russians.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.848
And that will give them
something on their
counter terrorism thing.

04:39.848 --> 04:42.550
- Exactly.
- Still want to find
this Layla,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.418
ask her what she knows.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.154
Yeah, this is all
residential.

04:46.154 --> 04:48.923
Yeah, and Tony wrote it off
on his taxes as an office.

04:48.923 --> 04:51.125
I dig this.
What is this?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.861
Sonny Rollins
and Miles Davis

04:52.861 --> 04:54.362
on Miles' album
"Bag's Groove."

04:54.362 --> 04:56.764
Sweet.
What's it called?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.333
"Doxy."
Sonny wrote it.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.402
- You know a lot
about this stuff.
- A little.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.171
Ever listen to anything
written in this century?

05:03.171 --> 05:04.939
Still catching up on
the last one.

05:04.939 --> 05:06.407
Pull over, this is it.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.343
**

05:21.990 --> 05:23.157
Some office.

05:33.134 --> 05:34.735
This is the life,
huh, Harry.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.205
Where did we go wrong?
I mean, we could be
out here poolside

05:37.205 --> 05:38.606
hangin' with
these fine ladies.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.275
You sure you guys
don't need a warrant?

05:41.275 --> 05:42.776
We're checking on her
well-being, sir.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.145
She was
romantically involved

05:44.145 --> 05:45.513
with a man
who was murdered recently.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.615
Murdered?
That's awful.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.917
Just making sure
she's okay.

05:48.917 --> 05:51.285
Of course.
Hope to God
she's all right.

05:52.954 --> 05:54.522
Last time
you saw here?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.958
Ten days, two weeks.
Something like that.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.092
How'd she pay
the rent?

05:58.092 --> 05:59.961
Direct deposit,
first of the month.

05:59.961 --> 06:01.595
I wouldn't be expecting
a deposit next month.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.564
Yeah, it doesn't look like
she's comin' back.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.934
Did she
fill out an application
before she moved in?

06:05.934 --> 06:07.335
Credit check,
rental history.

06:07.335 --> 06:08.569
We're gonna want to
take a look at that.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.938
I have it in the office.

06:09.938 --> 06:11.940
We'll stop
on the way out. Thanks.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.946
When are we gonna interview
the girls at the pool, Harry?

06:17.946 --> 06:19.647
Left dirty dishes.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.817
Cell phone.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.587
No wonder we couldn't
locate it. She killed it.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.555
Smart.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.095
What are those?

06:34.095 --> 06:36.397
They're in Armenian.
Religious, maybe.

06:38.967 --> 06:42.170
Little girl, Layla?
Grandma, maybe?

06:42.170 --> 06:45.439
That's not L.A. for sure.
That's the old country.

07:02.023 --> 07:03.191
Remember me?

07:07.028 --> 07:09.998
Ah, you're
one of the assholes
who busted Lucky.

07:09.998 --> 07:11.599
We're looking for Layla.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.301
- Knock on her door?
- Cut the shit.

07:13.301 --> 07:15.336
- You know she's gone.
- Where'd she go?

07:15.336 --> 07:16.470
No idea.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.206
Soon as she heard
Tony was dead,

07:18.206 --> 07:19.473
- outta here.
- You see her go?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.143
- Nope.
- So how'd you know?

07:22.143 --> 07:23.577
Her car was gone.
Poof.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.380
Where would she go
from here?

07:26.380 --> 07:27.748
Now that her
guardian angel's gone,

07:27.748 --> 07:28.782
who the fuck knows.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.018
Why would you call him that?

07:30.018 --> 07:32.020
She worked in this shit hole
in North Vegas

07:32.020 --> 07:34.522
with some other
foreign girls.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.025
Not a nice place.
Tony pulled her out of there.

07:37.025 --> 07:38.392
A brothel.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.294
I'd call it a cat house,
but hey.

07:43.031 --> 07:44.798
Yeah,
still waiting on details.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.368
- What time?
- Uh, tonight.

07:47.368 --> 07:49.103
They said they'd
let me know.

07:49.103 --> 07:51.205
And this woman, Mo.

07:51.205 --> 07:54.142
Yeah, I've been
workin' on that.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.643
Matched her face
to a name.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.046
Maureen O'Grady.

07:58.046 --> 08:00.348
Vice cop.
Mission Division.

08:00.348 --> 08:01.315
Good work.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.284
Yeah, well,
it's a start.

08:03.284 --> 08:06.054
We'll see who shows up
to the party tonight.

08:06.054 --> 08:07.155
When do you see
Lyle next?

08:07.155 --> 08:09.957
Day after tomorrow.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.792
You doin' okay
with all of this?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.161
No, I'm good.

08:16.497 --> 08:20.268
I, um--
I know it's been
hard for you.

08:20.268 --> 08:21.535
To make your own way
in the department,

08:21.535 --> 08:26.307
find yourself,
get out from under my shadow.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.542
Uh, well, you know,
I think I've got

08:28.542 --> 08:30.811
a really good shot of
doing that with this gig.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.781
You know,
if I could just get to
the head of that snake.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.349
I'm confident you will.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.621
Well, thanks.

08:48.496 --> 08:50.598
This look like a North Vegas
shit hole to you?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.833
Yeah, the previous address
on her rental app.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.335
Bet there's no pool.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.183
Everybody sit tight.

09:09.183 --> 09:11.219
We're looking for
this girl, Layla.

09:11.219 --> 09:13.721
She used to work here,
live here?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.225
Anybody know where she is?
We need to talk to her.

09:21.129 --> 09:23.631
You work for Joey Marks.
This is his place.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.665
This is my place.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.602
Hey, get the fuck
outta here. Go. Now.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.438
Look, you want to
tell me fairytales,

09:30.438 --> 09:32.573
I got nothin' better to do.
We can stay here all day,

09:32.573 --> 09:34.041
and you can explain
to Joey Marks

09:34.041 --> 09:35.376
where all his
business went.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.314
The girl you look for,
Layla,

09:40.314 --> 09:42.350
she not been here
a long time.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.984
- Couple years.
- Where'd she go?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.619
She's dancer.
Probably strip club.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.988
- Dolly's?
- She meet customer.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.529
Customer?

09:55.529 --> 09:57.565
Customer fall in love
with Lilliat.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.600
Lilliat?
Is that her real name?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.668
Lilliat Saroyan.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.473
Lilliat Saroyan.
You know where she is?

10:05.473 --> 10:08.542
I do not know.
Please, leave now.

10:13.481 --> 10:15.983
That was
fucking depressing.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.718
What do you think,
they traffic?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.487
Someone should
talk to those women,

10:19.487 --> 10:20.921
find out if they're
free to leave,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.856
and who's got
their passports.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.358
Joey Marks?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.126
It's his place,
I'll reach out to Felton,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.196
let them handle it.

10:28.196 --> 10:29.463
How do people
live out here?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.232
It's a fuckin' desert.

10:31.232 --> 10:32.633
L.A.'s a desert.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.968
- With an ocean.
- It's still a desert.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.304
I thought
you loved L.A.

10:36.304 --> 10:39.673
I do,
but I know what it is.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.944
Hmm.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.747
Hey, how about
some new shades?

11:19.747 --> 11:21.081
Ray Bans?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.917
Retro girl.
Take after your dad.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.053
I hope so.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.155
Look, there's
Monocle Optical.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.057
Let's take the stairs.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.659
It's on
the third floor.

11:31.659 --> 11:33.026
We can use
the exercise.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.595
I get lots of exercise.

11:34.595 --> 11:37.865
Yeah,
your thumbs look really strong
from all that texting.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.166
Ha, ha. Very funny.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.770
- Thumb war?
- No way.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.818
Hey.

12:00.421 --> 12:03.357
Oh.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.027
Anything else?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.830
Oh, I got my Krispy Kremes,
coffee, good to go.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.100
- Have a good day, officer.
- All right.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.869
Asshole.

12:47.668 --> 12:48.969
Hey, you've reached George.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.071
Leave a message.
Call you back.

12:52.540 --> 12:57.010
Hey, uh, call me
when you get a chance,
will you?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.480
Your mother wants to know
what your plans are for tonight.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.889
Did you happen to check out
your groovy little case?

13:08.889 --> 13:11.158
I know. It has
a little cleaner
in there, too.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.527
Always important.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.363
Do we want to
get coffee?

13:15.363 --> 13:16.497
- Yeah.
- On the way out?

13:16.497 --> 13:18.399
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

13:18.399 --> 13:19.567
Good.

14:17.425 --> 14:18.826
Hey, I thought
this new contract

14:18.826 --> 14:21.261
was supposed to guarantee us
separate accommodations?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.931
It does.
Somebody fucked up.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.799
Could be worse.
Could be bunking with
Crate or Barrel.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.901
Yeah.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.903
Hey, Jerry, what color
is your toothbrush?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.004
Blue. Why?

14:32.906 --> 14:33.874
No reason.

14:36.544 --> 14:37.545
Seeing the family
tonight?

14:37.545 --> 14:39.312
Yeah. Come with.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.714
No, I thought I'd hit
the Spearmint.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.249
Hearing's at 9:00.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.250
I'll be there.

14:48.789 --> 14:50.858
Hey, honey.

14:50.858 --> 14:51.992
Maddie?

14:51.992 --> 14:55.529
- Daddy.
- Maddie, what's wrong?

14:55.529 --> 14:57.164
Maddie, what's going on?

14:57.164 --> 14:59.467
I'm supposed to--
I'm supposed to tell you

14:59.467 --> 15:00.901
that Mom and I
are both okay,

15:00.901 --> 15:03.537
- and that--
- Maddie. Maddie!

15:03.537 --> 15:05.338
Don't make this difficult.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.207
- Who is this?
- Harry.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.477
- What do you want?
-Don't call the police.

15:09.477 --> 15:12.646
If you harm them,
I will tear your teeth out,
you son of a bitch.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.548
- And you--
- Harry, what's wrong?

15:14.548 --> 15:15.816
What the fuck's going on?

15:16.684 --> 15:17.851
Harry, what's going on?

15:17.851 --> 15:19.386
Maddie and Eleanor
have been kidnapped.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.654
Who? Why?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.222
I don't know.
Marks.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.390
Shit. We gotta call
Vegas Metro.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.925
No! No.
No fuckin' police.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.594
- They said no police.
- They always say that.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.629
Look, until I know
what I'm dealing with,

15:28.629 --> 15:30.498
I'm not taking
any chances.

15:30.498 --> 15:32.165
Fuck this.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.067
This isn't our town.
We don't even know
where to begin.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.035
I do.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.007
Where you going?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.108
Eleanor's.

15:42.743 --> 15:44.978
She's got an app.
Tracks Maddie's phone.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.650
Just don't kill us
before we get there.

15:58.759 --> 16:01.529
Clear upstairs.
Laptop.

16:01.529 --> 16:02.663
Kitchen.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.107
Clear!

16:14.107 --> 16:16.076
Harry, got it.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.178
It's password protected.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.213
Try AKQJ10.

16:22.550 --> 16:26.820
Zero-1-1-0-0-1.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.623
- Got it. What was that?
- Maddie's birthday.

16:29.623 --> 16:32.693
Scroll up.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.628
Right there.
Open.

16:34.628 --> 16:39.466
It's a home
security system.
Rewind.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.068
Fast forward.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.035
Play.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.614
Oh. You motherfuckers,
I'm gonna kill you both.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.731
The tracking app.
The pin will tell us
where her phone's at.

17:10.731 --> 17:15.302
They would have
turned it off
after she called.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.737
Shit.

17:16.737 --> 17:19.139
History log can pinpoint
where she was when she called.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.846
- There.
- Kyle Canyon Road
off 157.

17:25.846 --> 17:27.214
It's 20 miles from here
at least.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.281
It's getting dark.

17:54.642 --> 17:55.643
Nice ride.

17:55.643 --> 17:57.344
It's a loaner.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.339
Jerry!

18:33.313 --> 18:34.948
It's Maddie's phone.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.165
There's a duffel
back there.

18:58.939 --> 18:59.907
Hmm.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.575
Da-dosh.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.844
What the fuck is this?

19:03.844 --> 19:05.813
That?
That's a can opener.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.047
Saddle up, cowboy.

19:07.047 --> 19:08.115
Uh-huh.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.820
Yeah, where these from?

19:12.820 --> 19:14.621
- What the fuck do you care?
- I want to know.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.156
They're clean,
all right?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.558
There were used in
a multitude of felonies,
but not by us.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.794
Uh-huh.

19:20.794 --> 19:22.095
Yeah, where we goin',
anyway?

19:22.095 --> 19:24.231
Drop house on Fig.
Pick up's once a week.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.598
That's tomorrow.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.601
And tonight
is gonna be fatter than
a super gordo burrito.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.137
You're crowd control,
Junior.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.740
Anybody comes near you,
lay that fire down.
You feel me?

19:32.740 --> 19:35.909
Yeah, I feel ya, Mo.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.344
I feel you.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.119
- Bosch.
- Detective.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.355
- Who is this?
-Doesn't matter.

19:48.355 --> 19:52.159
You tell Marks
anyone lays a hand
on my family,

19:52.159 --> 19:55.395
a single scratch,
and I'll kill you all.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.831
Burn you to
the fucking ground.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.666
Keep your cool,
detective,

19:59.666 --> 20:02.235
and nothing will happen
to anybody.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.403
I'm listening.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.205
Tomorrow morning
after the hearing,

20:05.205 --> 20:08.241
Rykoff will be
in your custody.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.845
You're going to
deliver him to us.

20:11.845 --> 20:13.313
And if I do that,

20:13.313 --> 20:15.648
how are you gonna deliver
my family back to me?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.751
Do exactly as we say.

20:17.751 --> 20:22.722
There is a truck stop
just before
the California border.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.025
Off 15 in Primm.

20:25.025 --> 20:27.094
Pull in for gas.

20:27.094 --> 20:29.997
Thank the Nevada State Patrol
for their escort,

20:29.997 --> 20:32.132
and send them
on their way.

20:32.132 --> 20:36.236
Tell your partner
to go inside for coffee.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.973
While you fill the tank,
certain things will happen.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.609
Rykoff will come with us.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.244
The ladies will go free.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.886
Good.

20:52.886 --> 20:55.255
Marks wants to trade Rykoff
for Maddie and Eleanor.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.990
He's afraid
Rykoff's gonna flip.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.026
Must be to pull this shit.

20:59.026 --> 21:01.528
Rykoff must have
something heavy.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.595
We gotta call Vegas Metro.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.231
No. No cops.

21:04.231 --> 21:05.833
You don't want to
call the local,
let's call the Feds.

21:05.833 --> 21:07.534
Fuck the Feds.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.836
This is my family.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.102
Watch the street.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.485
Oh, shit!

22:01.154 --> 22:02.990
Down on the floor!

22:19.039 --> 22:21.909
What? Let's hit it.
Go!

22:21.909 --> 22:23.743
Whoa. Go!

22:23.743 --> 22:24.777
- Go, go, go.
- Go on. Go!

22:24.777 --> 22:25.812
Shit!

22:31.184 --> 22:32.585
Oh!

22:32.585 --> 22:34.054
Go! Go!

22:34.054 --> 22:35.355
Goddammit.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.931
Marks.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.469
His people kidnapped
my ex wife and daughter.

22:49.469 --> 22:52.105
Now he says he won't hurt them
if I turn you over to him.

22:52.105 --> 22:55.608
Bullshit,
you wouldn't do that.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.244
You got one play here.
You give me something,

22:57.244 --> 22:59.012
anything that
gets my family back,

22:59.012 --> 23:02.615
or I swear to God,
I'll hand you over to
Joey Marks in a heartbeat.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.588
Who are these mutts?

23:13.593 --> 23:14.627
Brothers.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.496
Samoans,
Tom, Jerry.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.166
Call 'em that 'cause
nobody can pronounce
their fuckin' names.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.568
Where do I find them?

23:21.568 --> 23:24.437
Safe house in the desert.
Tooley Springs.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.406
Sometimes use it
for shit like this.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.674
You tell me
how to get there.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.396
Hello.
- Lieutenant Lyle,
Deputy Chief Irving.

23:49.396 --> 23:51.598
- Chief.
- I'm tracking
my son's phone.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.000
Has he checked in
with you yet?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.467
He's following protocol,
sir.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.835
I left him a message
earlier today,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.104
he never got back to me.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.838
No cause for concern,
chief.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.740
I expect to hear from him
first thing in the morning.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.743
We're tracking him, too.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.045
Thank you, lieutenant.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.731
I can't see shit.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.169
They're in there.

26:11.838 --> 26:14.507
On the couch,
front room.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.876
- Samoans?
- Yeah.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.478
Watchin' TV.

26:18.478 --> 26:20.913
One's strapped.
The other one I can't tell.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.684
I got an idea.

26:31.524 --> 26:33.393
Ah, what is
this shit now?

26:38.030 --> 26:39.332
Like that's
gonna help.

26:41.168 --> 26:43.236
I can't see through
your stomach, bra.

26:43.236 --> 26:44.971
Maybe it's the wind again.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.606
Go check the dish.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.177
And take your fuckin' gun.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.206
Tom or Jerry?

27:19.206 --> 27:21.007
- Tom.
- Who's in the house?

27:21.007 --> 27:23.476
- My brother.
- Anyone else?

27:24.211 --> 27:26.213
What's he carrying?

27:26.213 --> 27:27.314
A .44.

28:03.883 --> 28:07.454
You move, you die.

28:07.454 --> 28:10.757
Get on the fucking floor
nice and slow.

28:29.309 --> 28:30.477
Clear!

28:32.445 --> 28:34.080
We're okay.
We're okay.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.982
We're okay.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.285
- Daddy.
- It's okay, baby,
it's okay.

28:38.285 --> 28:39.552
It's okay.

28:45.358 --> 28:46.893
Whatcha doin',
Harry?

28:46.893 --> 28:49.596
I'm calling Felton,
have him come take out
the trash.

28:49.596 --> 28:51.464
Okay, wait.
Before you do that,

28:51.464 --> 28:53.165
- can I speak to you?
- Okay.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.935
Okay,
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.003
Okay?

28:57.003 --> 28:58.905
- You got this, Jerry?
- I got this.

29:09.649 --> 29:10.783
All right.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.788
It's just-- I just--
I can't stop shaking.

29:17.524 --> 29:19.526
It's okay.
It's okay.

29:19.526 --> 29:22.329
Shh, shh.
It's okay.

29:22.329 --> 29:24.864
It's okay,
it's okay.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.334
I don't-- I don't want you
to call the cops, okay?

29:28.868 --> 29:31.871
Eleanor, you can't
let these pigs walk

29:31.871 --> 29:33.172
after what they did
to you and our daughter.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.074
Our daughter
cannot be a witness.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.976
- Not against Joey Marks.
- We can protect her.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.579
No. You're gonna have to
find another way, okay?

29:39.579 --> 29:40.880
'Cause I'm not gonna
testify,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.782
and I'm not gonna
let her testify.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.788
Okay, but you and Maddie
have to get out of Vegas
by tomorrow morning.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.257
- And go where?
- L.A. My place.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.625
Until this blows over.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.030
Okay.

29:59.366 --> 30:01.401
Okay.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.269
Jerry.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.971
Take Eleanor and Maddie
to the car.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.006
Gotta stop off at their place
and get some stuff

30:07.006 --> 30:10.710
before we go back
to the hotel.

30:10.710 --> 30:11.811
Harry.

30:13.580 --> 30:16.015
Go on.
I won't be long.

30:40.873 --> 30:44.477
You put a gun to
my daughter's head.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.996
Top lock
sticks a little.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.064
I'll figure it out.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.666
Extradition hearing
is this morning.

32:46.666 --> 32:48.167
We're on the road
by noon back to L.A.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.201
I'm home by dinner.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.270
Great. I hope
nothing happens before then.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.272
Eleanor.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.608
Nothing's gonna happen.

32:55.608 --> 32:56.943
Billets is gonna
send some cops

32:56.943 --> 32:58.545
to pick you up
at the airport,

32:58.545 --> 32:59.946
and take you
to my place.

32:59.946 --> 33:02.181
They'll
look in on you later.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.084
Okay. Okay.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.986
Dad, please
come with us, Dad.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.188
- Honey, I can't.
- No, Dad, please.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.558
Honey, I can't.

33:11.558 --> 33:14.060
There are some things
I have to do.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.828
I promise you,

33:15.828 --> 33:19.566
none of those people
will ever bother you again.

33:19.566 --> 33:21.167
Do you believe me?

33:21.167 --> 33:22.368
Okay.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.804
Now, look,
your mother's very upset,

33:24.804 --> 33:26.238
and she has
every right to be,

33:26.238 --> 33:29.642
but I would never knowingly
put you in harm's way.

33:29.642 --> 33:32.311
I hope you know that.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.981
I know that.

33:34.981 --> 33:36.783
Just like I knew
you'd come back for us.

33:45.592 --> 33:46.693
I'll be home tonight.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.030
We need to
get through security.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.135
Eleanor, there's a Glock
in the record cabinet,

33:56.135 --> 33:58.470
and a 12 gauge
on the top shelf
in my bedroom closet.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.940
I just want you to
know where they are.

34:00.940 --> 34:03.610
Okay?

34:03.610 --> 34:04.711
Okay.

34:16.756 --> 34:18.124
Detective Bosch.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.959
I'm Dave Warren
representing Mr. Rykoff.

34:19.959 --> 34:21.527
Before we
waive extradition--

34:21.527 --> 34:23.429
What? You're not
fighting it?

34:23.429 --> 34:24.897
Well, what would be
the point?

34:24.897 --> 34:26.165
You got the murder weapon
and you tied it to my client.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.466
How it got there
and who put it there

34:27.466 --> 34:29.368
is a matter
for another day.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.471
I need some assurances about
the security of his transport
to L.A.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.174
We'll drive
straight through,
no stops.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.442
That's what
I wanted to hear.

34:39.178 --> 34:43.783
Docket 6-2-0-5,
State versus Lucas Rykoff.

34:43.783 --> 34:45.051
Thank you, Tess.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.721
This matter is an
extradition hearing.

34:48.721 --> 34:50.923
- Is the State ready?
- The State is ready,
Judge.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.659
David Warren
representing the defendant.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.160
Your Honor, if I may,

34:54.160 --> 34:56.295
at this time the defendant
wishes to waive his right

34:56.295 --> 34:58.965
to contest extradition
to the state of California.

34:58.965 --> 35:02.034
So noted.
Tess, what's next.

35:15.682 --> 35:17.984
Be right with you.

35:17.984 --> 35:18.951
Harry.

35:20.953 --> 35:24.490
Yes, sir.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.492
Uh, yes sir,
this afternoon,

35:26.492 --> 35:28.360
as soon as
he's processed--

35:28.360 --> 35:29.395
Hey.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.997
Marks.

35:30.997 --> 35:32.965
You ever come near
my family again,

35:32.965 --> 35:35.367
I'll cut your strings and
leave you drooling in a chair.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.174
I don't suppose
you're gonna tell me

35:42.174 --> 35:43.776
what happened
last night, huh?

35:43.776 --> 35:45.411
You're right, I'm not.
Let's go.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.125
Bosch.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.161
We ran that vehicle search
on Lilliat Saroyan, got a hit.

36:02.161 --> 36:05.865
2012 Altima
registered to this address.

36:05.865 --> 36:07.433
Tony Allen's Vegas office.
You lookin' for the car?

36:07.433 --> 36:09.902
We found it.
Been in our impound
for a week.

36:09.902 --> 36:11.503
She left it at
the Greyhound station.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.272
Shit.
She could be anywhere.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.641
Oh, we'll process it
for prints
in case she surfaces.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.944
- Thanks.
- All right, detective,
remember our deal.

36:17.944 --> 36:19.245
Partners on Rykoff.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.980
He starts giving up
secrets on Marks,

36:20.980 --> 36:22.214
I'm your first
phone call.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.449
Right.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.417
Nevada trooper will give you
a courtesy escort

36:25.417 --> 36:27.887
- to the state line.
- Appreciate it.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.561
What are you
so happy about?

36:35.561 --> 36:37.096
Why shouldn't I be?

36:37.096 --> 36:39.398
First degree murder indictment
doesn't worry you?

36:39.398 --> 36:40.532
Man, I got an alibi.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.001
We heard different.

36:42.001 --> 36:44.236
I got no motive
to kill Tony Allen.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.438
Joey Marks told you to.
That was your motive.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.574
My lawyer's gonna shred
that search warrant,

36:48.574 --> 36:49.776
and he's gonna
shred you, Bosch,

36:49.776 --> 36:50.910
for planting that
fucking gun.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.979
That gun gets kicked,
I'm home free.

36:52.979 --> 36:55.514
If that happens,
which it won't,
then what?

36:55.514 --> 36:58.785
As far as Joey Marks
is concerned, you're dead,

36:58.785 --> 37:01.187
wherever you are,
the streets or in the joint.

37:01.187 --> 37:03.890
- Unless you cooperate.
- Fuck you.

37:22.809 --> 37:24.076
Rykoff, Luke.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.278
Extradition out of Vegas
on a 1-87.

37:26.278 --> 37:31.017
Kiko, I want him put on
keep-away status,
100 percent isolation.

37:31.017 --> 37:32.618
All right,
when the sheriff's
come to pick him up,

37:32.618 --> 37:35.087
make sure they know to
put him in protective custody

37:35.087 --> 37:36.823
on a John Doe lodging.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.098
Harry.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.867
Not now, Mank,
I gotta get home.

37:47.867 --> 37:50.369
Billets wants to see you
immediately,

37:50.369 --> 37:53.205
as soon as his feet
hit the premises, APB.

37:53.205 --> 37:55.741
- Pretend you didn't see me.
- I can't do it, buddy.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.410
Bring me the head of
Hieronymus Bosch.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.445
Her exact fuckin' words.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.412
Ah, shit.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.655
Lieutenant.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.722
You were just
gonna leave

38:10.722 --> 38:12.391
without giving me
a full report.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.926
I need to get home.
My family's waiting for me.

38:13.926 --> 38:15.061
How are they?

38:15.061 --> 38:16.495
Well,
they were pretty shaky

38:16.495 --> 38:18.097
when I took them to
the airport this morning.

38:18.097 --> 38:19.932
Well, I can understand.

38:19.932 --> 38:23.169
I can also understand why
certain decisions were made
in haste last night.

38:23.169 --> 38:24.904
- I appreciate that.
- But--

38:24.904 --> 38:26.638
- Okay.
- You need to
talk to Eleanor.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.640
Get her to file
on these thugs.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.009
Letting them walk
is a mistake,

38:30.009 --> 38:32.244
and I am compromised
because you told me about it.

38:32.244 --> 38:33.445
She isn't gonna
change her mind.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.746
They belong in prison.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.950
Look, no way Joey Marks
is gonna let those guys
skate

38:37.950 --> 38:39.251
after screwing this up.

38:39.251 --> 38:43.055
They will get what is
coming to them.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.124
Do you really want
the full report?

38:47.426 --> 38:49.495
No, I do not.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.763
I just hope
this doesn't come back to
bite us all in the ass.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.200
It won't.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.968
Go be with your family.

38:55.968 --> 38:57.269
Thanks, Grace.

39:03.142 --> 39:06.913
- Dad.
- Whoa, what are you people
doing in my house?

39:08.981 --> 39:10.449
Hey, how you guys
settling in?

39:10.449 --> 39:12.551
- In the spare room.
- Good.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.021
- Find the towels?
- Same place
they always were.

39:15.021 --> 39:16.822
Brought some food.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.157
- What are we having?
- Mexican.

39:18.157 --> 39:21.827
Poquito Mas.
Best Mexican take out in L.A.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.930
And I got you
a new phone.

39:24.997 --> 39:27.166
Thanks, Dad.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.567
Why don't you go
set it up.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.536
Your mom and I'll
put food on the table.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.503
Okay.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.941
I'll grab some plates.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.088
How's she doing?

39:49.088 --> 39:50.322
I don't know.

39:50.322 --> 39:53.960
She seems fine but
it could all be a front.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.327
I got a friend
in behavioral,

39:55.327 --> 39:57.063
shrink they sent me to
last year.

39:57.063 --> 39:59.131
You want I should reach out,
see if she'll talk to her?

39:59.131 --> 40:01.533
Oh, give it a couple of days,
see how she does.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.169
How'd the extradition go?

40:03.169 --> 40:06.372
Routine. Rykoff waived,
we brought him back,
booked him.

40:06.372 --> 40:08.740
Does that mean
we can go home?

40:08.740 --> 40:09.908
Not just yet.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.780
Where'd you find this?

40:14.780 --> 40:17.049
Back of the
linen closet.

40:17.049 --> 40:19.018
Our trip to
Catalina.

40:19.018 --> 40:22.654
Midwestern girl.
You didn't even believe
flying fish existed.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.655
I still don't.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.594
I see you redid
the kitchen.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.561
Yep.

40:31.063 --> 40:32.231
Looks good.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.837
So fuckin' weird
being back here.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.472
Ain't it the truth.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.574
He's runnin' out of the house
with his, like, mask askew

40:42.574 --> 40:44.977
lookin' out of one eye,
runnin' into a wall.

40:44.977 --> 40:47.079
His mask askew.

40:47.079 --> 40:50.082
Robbie, you are
so full of shit.

40:50.082 --> 40:51.450
- Hey, you know last night.
- Yeah.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.519
Did y'all fuckin'
bump somebody in there?

40:53.519 --> 40:55.587
No, bro,
just the ceiling.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.855
Gets their attention.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.624
Well, is sure as shit
got mine, I tell ya that.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.460
All that fuckin'
drywall dusk
up in my nose.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.662
That shit is
fuckin' carcinogenic.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.034
Now, what's that?

41:08.034 --> 41:09.435
It's your end.

41:09.435 --> 41:14.373
Mm-hm. Thank you.

41:14.373 --> 41:16.708
Uh-huh. Oh.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.280
Cap.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.749
- Cap.
- How's it goin'?

41:23.749 --> 41:26.685
It's goin' fine,
just fine.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.120
How are you all doin'?

41:28.120 --> 41:29.355
Can't complain.

41:31.090 --> 41:33.092
Irving.

41:33.092 --> 41:34.726
I'm told you did
real good last night.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.795
Yes,
you should have seen him.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.130
He took out
this big beaner

41:38.130 --> 41:40.066
like he was fuckin'
Ronda Rousey.

41:40.066 --> 41:41.800
Uh-huh. Yeah,
thank you.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.102
I, uh-- I think.

41:43.102 --> 41:45.071
- Mm.
- And, uh--

41:45.071 --> 41:47.773
Thanks for the dinero.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.975
De nada.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.078
There's good times ahead.

41:52.078 --> 41:53.745
Good times.

41:57.083 --> 41:59.418
You're the key
that's gonna unlock

41:59.418 --> 42:01.187
a lot of new doors for us.

42:06.125 --> 42:07.759
Just glad to be
a part of it.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.496
Oh, no, sorry.

42:10.496 --> 42:12.364
You're not
a part of it yet.

42:13.699 --> 42:14.666
I'm not?

42:19.305 --> 42:22.741
There's one more thing
you gotta do first.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.943
We have a little...

42:24.943 --> 42:26.345
initiation ritual.

42:26.345 --> 42:29.615
We like to call it
the Iron Rodeo.

42:31.150 --> 42:34.120
Rodeo? What you, uh--

42:34.120 --> 42:35.521
What you mean, like
riding horses and shit?

42:35.521 --> 42:36.755
Yeah, it's somethin'
like that.

42:36.755 --> 42:39.991
All right. Yeah,
but I don't ride horses.

42:42.128 --> 42:43.529
You'll ride this one.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.721
Come on, man.
Down to your skivvies.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.758
Anything you don't want
covered in oil
for the next 20 years.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.231
You guys all did this?

43:19.231 --> 43:20.899
- For real?
- All of us.

43:20.899 --> 43:21.867
Even O'Grady.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.171
Now that I would have
liked to see.

44:28.234 --> 44:30.336
Get up there,
you little bitch!

44:49.255 --> 44:52.558
- Yeah!
- Whoo, whoo!

45:11.109 --> 45:12.378
Ride that thing!

45:14.780 --> 45:16.348
Woo!

45:26.292 --> 45:30.128
Woooo!

45:30.128 --> 45:31.897
Yeah!
Yeah!

45:51.317 --> 45:52.318
Fuck's this?

45:52.318 --> 45:53.652
I think it's a wire.

45:53.652 --> 45:56.388
Shit.

45:56.388 --> 45:58.056
Can you wipe it?

45:58.056 --> 45:59.124
Keep him busy.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.759
You got it.

46:39.698 --> 46:42.834
Yeah!

46:55.013 --> 46:57.916
**
