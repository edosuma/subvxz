would've flown to Tahiti

11:52.846 --> 11:56.096
for the wedding
of dumbo and bimbo.

11:57.977 --> 12:00.135
Thanks for getting her here.

12:00.896 --> 12:02.854
How did you manage
to keep it a secret?

12:03.024 --> 12:06.607
Well, as a psychiatrist,

12:06.778 --> 12:10.230
discretion happens to be
the cornerstone of my profession.

12:10.449 --> 12:14.032
Of course. Mine too.
l'm a family therapist.

12:14.578 --> 12:15.824
Really?

12:15.997 --> 12:18.488
You know, l sensed
we'd have a lot in common.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.164
You know,
it's funny how things turn out.

12:21.336 --> 12:25.714
l started out as a music major
studying cello.

12:27.968 --> 12:29.083
You're a cellist?

12:29.303 --> 12:33.930
Yes, but psychology
is my true calling.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.936
<i>Spawning fish may leap upstream
For many seasons</i>

12:37.104 --> 12:39.061
<i>Yet come home to stay</i>

12:41.275 --> 12:44.691
- Was that a haiku?
- Yes.

12:45.488 --> 12:46.769
lt's a...

12:46.948 --> 12:50.567
lt's a habit of mine.
They just sort of spill out of me.

12:50.744 --> 12:54.078
That's amazing.
May l get you a drink?

12:54.665 --> 12:58.533
Yes, a martini. Two olives.

12:58.753 --> 13:02.003
l knew it. Oh.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.802
- Kierkegaard?
- Love him.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.797
Don't move.

13:10.725 --> 13:13.346
Claire, what are you doing
standing here alone?

13:13.519 --> 13:16.640
l want you to meet Neil,
that guy l told you about.

13:17.816 --> 13:21.185
- Claire, Neil.
- Hi.

13:25.241 --> 13:26.783
MARTlN:
All right, what's it say now?

13:26.951 --> 13:29.442
DAPHNE:
''Alternatively, see Appendix C,

13:29.662 --> 13:32.533
'Advanced Troubleshooting
Specifications And You.'''

13:32.749 --> 13:35.038
That's it. l quit.

13:36.170 --> 13:37.712
What do you want to do?

13:38.339 --> 13:41.874
Well, l went to a party once
where we each went around the room

13:42.051 --> 13:44.625
and confessed
our most shameful secret.

13:44.804 --> 13:48.256
Except it had to be something
that you've never told anyone before.

13:48.433 --> 13:52.301
l don't think that's something
we really wanna get into.

13:53.523 --> 13:54.768
No, it sounds like fun.

13:54.941 --> 13:56.815
Okay, l'll go first.

13:58.361 --> 13:59.772
Oh, let's see. All right.

13:59.946 --> 14:04.027
Well, Daphne, you might as well make
your acquaintance with my dark side.

14:06.078 --> 14:10.622
ln 5th grade,
there was a bully, Jack Winfield,

14:10.792 --> 14:12.666
and he was bothering a lot of the girls.

14:12.836 --> 14:14.959
So one day,
l waited for him outside of school

14:15.130 --> 14:17.538
and gave him a sound thumping.

14:21.804 --> 14:24.093
Wasn't that the kid with rickets?

14:25.600 --> 14:28.305
Rickets and a smart mouth.

14:29.521 --> 14:30.802
Daphne, you go next.

14:30.981 --> 14:33.437
And think of something juicier
than that.

14:34.610 --> 14:38.525
Well, mine's also
a youthful indiscretion.

14:39.783 --> 14:41.941
l stole a teddy bear from the shops.

14:42.995 --> 14:44.157
Then what?

14:44.371 --> 14:49.081
Well, l felt guilty, so l told my parents
and we brought it back.

14:49.252 --> 14:54.044
Then as a penance, l volunteered
to work at the orphanage after school.

15:00.139 --> 15:03.674
What the hell was that?
l'd put that story on my résumé.

15:05.061 --> 15:06.888
Come on, Martin,
you've gotta have something.

15:07.105 --> 15:08.813
- Shock me.
- Oh, l don't know.

15:08.982 --> 15:10.061
lt's kind of personal.

15:10.275 --> 15:12.232
That's what we're looking for.

15:12.402 --> 15:16.864
Well, all right,
but it doesn't leave this room.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.618
<i>Every time l watch
The Sound of Music,</i>

15:21.955 --> 15:23.414
l cry.

15:25.667 --> 15:30.793
And l don't mean a single manly tear,
l mean real blubbering.

15:30.965 --> 15:32.245
Girl-style.

15:33.843 --> 15:36.513
The nuns, those kids...

15:37.889 --> 15:40.677
...the lonely goatherd.

15:42.436 --> 15:45.556
These are your deep, dark secrets?
This is baby stuff.

15:45.731 --> 15:48.104
''Oh, l dropped my ice cream
and l ate it.''

15:48.318 --> 15:50.145
Okay, let's hear yours, then.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.609
You can't handle mine.
Let's play Clue or something.

15:52.823 --> 15:54.614
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

15:54.825 --> 15:57.910
Are you kidding? We can take
anything you can dish out.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.579
l was in the war. l was a cop.

15:59.747 --> 16:02.036
- l even worked Vice.
- l don't think so.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.124
Come on, tell you what,
whisper it in my ear,

16:04.294 --> 16:06.287
and if l think they can handle it,
l'll tell them.

16:07.422 --> 16:09.249
Okay.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.327
Where was Kathy
when l was busting my ass

16:38.499 --> 16:40.456
putting him through dental school?

16:40.668 --> 16:45.081
Oh, oh, that's right.
She wasn't born yet!

16:46.299 --> 16:48.625
- Who wants more cake?
- Not me, but l'll go with you.

16:50.763 --> 16:54.346
Here we are.
This is one of my favourites.

16:54.558 --> 16:58.391
That's so sweet of you,
but Neil just brought me a glass.

16:58.605 --> 17:00.348
Opus One.

17:00.523 --> 17:02.350
Opus One.
That's a delightful little wine.

17:02.526 --> 17:06.987
Yes, it's very nice, but this happens
to be a Barbaresco Gaja,

17:07.156 --> 17:10.988
the greatest ltalian red
since Roberto Rossellini.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.577
Well...

17:20.003 --> 17:21.795
Mm.

17:26.426 --> 17:28.800
- Mm.
- Ah.

17:28.972 --> 17:31.546
Well, they both taste wonderful.

17:31.725 --> 17:34.051
l don't...
l can't choose between them.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.262
Taste mine again.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.183
You know,
if you're really interested in wine,

17:39.359 --> 17:41.435
you should let me fly you
down to Napa in my plane.

17:41.611 --> 17:43.521
We could spend the day
exploring the vineyards.

17:43.697 --> 17:47.232
That's very sweet, but those
little planes make me nervous.

17:47.451 --> 17:50.238
Really?
Well, how do you feel about BMWs?

17:51.581 --> 17:53.408
You see, l happen to know

17:53.583 --> 17:55.825
several of the proprietors
of the local vineyards here,

17:56.002 --> 17:57.794
and l'd be delighted
to be your tour guide.

17:58.964 --> 18:00.375
That's sounds tempting.

18:00.549 --> 18:04.250
Well, allow me to enchant you further.
You see, l--

18:06.806 --> 18:07.885
Claire, l'm sorry.

18:08.057 --> 18:10.299
You'll have to excuse me
for just a moment.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.558
Hi. How you doing?

18:19.111 --> 18:21.151
Everybody's leaving.

18:21.322 --> 18:22.485
Well, it's getting late.

18:22.657 --> 18:24.899
lt's 9:30.

18:26.161 --> 18:28.783
Let's face it, l drove them all off.

18:28.997 --> 18:31.749
Even l'm sick of hearing me
complain about Bob.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.243
Well, come on, it's not all that bad.

18:34.420 --> 18:37.540
l mean, listen, you know,
Bob is in the past.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.005
And just look
at all the friends you have.

18:41.428 --> 18:44.133
l know you've had
a bit of a tough time lately,

18:44.306 --> 18:46.050
but that'll end soon.

18:46.767 --> 18:50.931
You're a vibrant, attractive woman.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.106
Thanks, Frasier.

18:54.359 --> 18:57.064
- You're being awfully sweet to me.
- Oh.

18:57.946 --> 19:00.948
Don't think this means
you're getting any.

19:02.702 --> 19:04.529
We're saying our goodbyes.

19:04.704 --> 19:05.949
You're leaving?

19:06.122 --> 19:09.871
l have an early appointment and
Neil offered to give me a ride home.

19:10.085 --> 19:13.003
Well, how thoughtful of him.

19:13.214 --> 19:16.001
- Happy birthday, Lana.
- Oh, thank you.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.041
Bye.

19:18.219 --> 19:20.675
lt's nice to see you again, Frasier.

19:20.889 --> 19:24.673
Lovely seeing you again, Claire.
Neil.

19:34.029 --> 19:36.698
- Threw a gutter ball, huh?
- Yeah.

19:37.574 --> 19:39.567
Thanks to you.
You introduced them.

19:39.743 --> 19:43.611
Well, you played it all wrong.
You were hanging on her all night.

19:43.831 --> 19:45.539
Well, so was he, but he left with her.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.288
lt won't last.
She's probably sick of him already.

19:48.503 --> 19:51.540
A lot of good that does me. l blew it.

19:51.715 --> 19:53.340
Not necessarily.

19:53.509 --> 19:56.178
l mean, l think you guys
could make a great couple.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.837
ln fact, l might be able
to help you out there.

19:59.015 --> 20:01.637
Really? Would you?

20:01.810 --> 20:05.144
Well, l could, but you know,
l get asked that all the time.

20:05.314 --> 20:08.019
And if l did it for you,
l'd have to have to do it for everybody.

20:08.192 --> 20:12.735
And l just don't know
if l wanna open those floodgates.

20:12.905 --> 20:14.982
You know what l mean?

20:15.742 --> 20:17.949
l think l do.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.863
Kirby needs a passing grade
in History.

20:20.038 --> 20:23.159
- l can't guarantee that.
- No passing grade, no Claire.

20:23.334 --> 20:24.614
All right, an hour on Tuesdays.

20:24.794 --> 20:26.253
Two hours on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.831
Two hours on Tuesdays,
no Thursday.

20:28.006 --> 20:29.120
Three on Tuesdays.

20:29.299 --> 20:32.134
- Done. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

20:34.263 --> 20:37.964
Well, you are a very
lucky young man, Kirby.

20:38.142 --> 20:41.143
You know,
l loved studying U.S. history.

20:41.354 --> 20:42.813
What can be more fascinating

20:42.981 --> 20:49.565
than the rich and unfolding epic
of the very soil on which we live?

20:51.073 --> 20:54.442
Uh, will that question be on the test?

20:57.372 --> 20:59.080
Doubtful.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.866
So which chapter are you on?

21:02.085 --> 21:05.003
Whoa, is that my book?

21:06.924 --> 21:09.795
l see. Chapter 1 .

21:11.513 --> 21:13.636
You may wanna take some notes.

21:14.015 --> 21:15.807
l don't have a pen.

21:15.976 --> 21:17.684
But just tell me, l'll remember it.

21:17.895 --> 21:20.979
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's gotten you far.

21:21.607 --> 21:24.774
Get off your ass and get a pen!

21:24.944 --> 21:28.230
No, not you, not you, not you.

22:50.373 --> 22:53.291
All right, Kirby, we've got a few
minutes before your mother gets here.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.536
One last question.

22:55.713 --> 22:57.290
ln our studies this week,

22:57.465 --> 23:01.794
what did we learn
about William Henry Harrison?

23:02.887 --> 23:08.724
Well, l guess l would say
that this week, we learned

23:08.894 --> 23:12.809
that William Henry Harrison
was a great man

23:13.024 --> 23:17.353
who was important
because he was...

23:18.697 --> 23:22.564
- President?
- No. Yes, yes.

23:22.743 --> 23:25.199
Good, good.
And which president was he?

23:25.412 --> 23:27.820
Of the United States.

23:28.583 --> 23:29.828
l mean which number?

23:30.960 --> 23:32.241
All right, here's a hint.

23:32.462 --> 23:36.330
He was elected in 1 840.

23:36.550 --> 23:38.673
- Eighteen.
- No.

23:38.886 --> 23:41.294
- Forty?
- Kirby.

23:41.514 --> 23:43.423
Did you do any reading this week?

23:43.975 --> 23:46.383
- Sort of.
- What does ''sort of'' mean?

23:46.603 --> 23:48.394
- No.
- Right.

23:49.147 --> 23:50.262
Why not?

23:50.440 --> 23:53.110
Because it's a bunch of junk
l'm never gonna need to know.

23:53.277 --> 23:56.860
Kirby, this junk, as you call it,
may seem unimportant to you now,

23:57.031 --> 23:58.858
but knowing something
about where we came from

23:59.033 --> 24:01.489
may help you to decide
where you wish to go.

24:01.703 --> 24:07.824
Now, let's start learning about history
lest you be condemned to repeat it.

24:08.002 --> 24:09.081
Start reading.

24:09.253 --> 24:11.163
Continue until
your mother gets here.

24:12.715 --> 24:14.625
- Hi, Dad.
MARTlN: Hey, Fras.

24:14.843 --> 24:18.343
You know that guy Roger on 1 4,
has that little Scottish terrier?

24:18.972 --> 24:21.179
- Macduff?
- Right.

24:21.392 --> 24:24.642
Well, Roger's invited
all these dogs from the park

24:24.812 --> 24:26.889
to Macduff's birthday party.

24:27.065 --> 24:29.271
Except Eddie. Thank God.

24:29.442 --> 24:31.400
Have you ever heard
of anything more ridiculous?

24:31.612 --> 24:34.613
l see, and putting a hat on Eddie
for every major holiday, that's normal?

24:34.782 --> 24:38.400
- What? lt's not every holiday.
- Oh, Dad, please.

24:38.619 --> 24:41.621
He's got a Santa cap for Christmas,
he's got a top hat for New Year's Eve.

24:41.790 --> 24:43.782
He's got a tam-o'-shanter
for Saint Patrick's Day.

24:43.959 --> 24:47.293
Well, they're just hats.
l mean, it's not a whole party.

24:47.463 --> 24:49.040
l mean,
a dog doesn't know his birthday

24:49.256 --> 24:51.379
any more than he knows
Friday or Saturday or--

24:51.592 --> 24:53.751
Or Cinco de Mayo?

24:53.928 --> 24:56.883
That sombrero was a gift.

24:57.849 --> 24:59.094
Keep reading.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.102
That's nice
that you're helping the kid out.

25:02.271 --> 25:06.186
Yeah, well, truth be told, Dad.
l'm actually...

25:06.943 --> 25:09.268
l've made a little agreement
with Lana.

25:09.487 --> 25:11.527
You see,
if l help Kirby get a passing grade,

25:11.698 --> 25:14.024
Lana will set me up
with one of her girlfriends, Claire.

25:14.201 --> 25:16.573
Ah. l remember
when you used to tutor kids

25:16.745 --> 25:18.026
so they wouldn't beat you up.

25:18.205 --> 25:20.779
So l guess this is progress, huh?

25:21.334 --> 25:23.042
[DOORBELL RlNGS]

25:23.211 --> 25:25.334
That would be your mother.

25:27.966 --> 25:29.377
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Frasier.

25:29.593 --> 25:31.633
You guys have
a good study session tonight?

25:31.846 --> 25:33.885
- Primo.
- We're making excellent progress.

25:34.056 --> 25:37.011
- Really? So, what'd you learn today?
- Yeah.

25:37.310 --> 25:42.056
Um... Well, today l learned
about William Henry Harrison,

25:42.232 --> 25:45.068
who was our ninth president.

25:46.070 --> 25:49.404
l mean, tenth. l mean, ninth.

25:51.034 --> 25:52.113
Good. Not bad.

25:52.285 --> 25:54.859
So you're one step closer
to getting your prom privileges back.

- Why not?

Thanks for spreading
that around, Mom.

26:00.670 --> 26:04.253
Frasier doesn't care.
He went to the prom with his brother.

Thanks for spreading that around.

- Sure.

You can listen to the radio.

But don't change my presets again.

it's lite hits or nothing!

26:20.775 --> 26:21.938
What do you wanna talk about?

26:22.110 --> 26:24.601
l was wondering if you had
a chance to speak with Claire yet,

26:24.780 --> 26:26.856
seeing as how Kirby
may be getting a passing grade.

26:27.032 --> 26:29.654
- Actually, l saw Claire yesterday.
- You did? That's wonderful.

26:29.827 --> 26:32.497
l've been thinking about our first date.
l thought perhaps tapas.

26:32.664 --> 26:34.455
l know that sounds whimsical,
but hear me.

26:34.666 --> 26:38.201
Frasier, look, all l did was mention
that you were tutoring Kirby.

26:38.378 --> 26:39.493
But she was very impressed.

26:39.713 --> 26:42.169
But you're supposed to set us up.
We have a deal.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.663
l'm phasing you in slowly.

26:43.843 --> 26:46.548
Look, she just broke up with Neil
because he was rushing things.

26:46.721 --> 26:49.343
Trust me, if you don't time this right,
you're gonna blow it.

26:49.516 --> 26:51.556
All right,
there's no need to explain to me.

26:51.727 --> 26:54.562
lf anyone understands the value
of restraint and taking things slowly,

26:54.730 --> 26:56.522
it is yours truly.

26:57.066 --> 26:58.940
Frasier, as l recall on our first date,

26:59.110 --> 27:01.317
you got me up to your apartment
on false pretences.

27:01.488 --> 27:04.193
You plied me with wine,
got me into bed,

27:04.366 --> 27:07.486
and then tried to weasel out
of ever seeing me again.

27:10.456 --> 27:13.374
l think ''plied'' is a bit strong.

27:17.130 --> 27:22.042
Hey, Frasier, l have a work-related
proposal l wanna run by you.

27:22.219 --> 27:24.046

A three-day weekend,
that's quite a dream.

27:36.652 --> 27:40.068
My dream is to have front-row seats
at Bruce Springsteen.

27:40.281 --> 27:42.653
That way, when he starts doing
''Dancing in the Dark,''

27:42.825 --> 27:45.447
there's a chance he'll pull me up
on-stage to dance with him.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.700

a Friday afternoon?

27:56.049 --> 27:57.673

instead of telling you the truth.

good honesty on you.

to adjust to sleeping with someone.

- So, what's the problem?

29:09.548 --> 29:11.837
Lana has told me that l am
under no circumstances

29:12.009 --> 29:13.420
to ask her out on a date.

29:13.594 --> 29:16.512
She says that if l rush things,
l will ruin my chances.

CLAlRE: Hi.

29:21.436 --> 29:22.599

l could call someone for you.

That'd be great.

29:34.784 --> 29:38.403
Hey, and while you're at it, see if you
can find someone who likes sherry.

29:38.580 --> 29:40.906
You know, Les Habitants
is having a tasting that week

29:41.083 --> 29:44.583
and l can't find anyone
who enjoys sherry as much as l do.

29:44.795 --> 29:47.713
Of course, l always have trouble
finding people who share my interests.

29:47.924 --> 29:50.593
l've been trying to convince someone
to go to London with me

29:50.802 --> 29:54.337
and see the New Tate Gallery
and the old Globe Theatre.

29:54.556 --> 29:55.719
And finally, l just gave up.

29:55.891 --> 29:58.299
And tomorrow,
l'm going alone for ten days.

29:58.477 --> 30:01.562

30:08.238 --> 30:09.816
The trick to remembering
the difference

30:09.990 --> 30:12.742
between William Henry Harrison
and William Howard Taft

30:12.910 --> 30:14.286
is a simple mnemonic device.

30:14.453 --> 30:16.114
Mne-what?

30:16.664 --> 30:18.372
lt's a trick.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.867
Harrison died in office
after his first month,

30:21.086 --> 30:26.163
so we say William Henry Harrison
was hardly healthy.

30:26.384 --> 30:32.423
And you can't spell Taft
without the letters F-A-T.

30:34.017 --> 30:37.054
So now to remember two things,
l have to remember two other things.

30:37.229 --> 30:38.510
Plus the first two things.

30:38.731 --> 30:40.937
- Yes, yes.
- That's four things.

30:41.108 --> 30:43.647
But the first two things
are easier to remember,

30:43.820 --> 30:45.148
and they are clues to the second.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.398

Oh, l so agree.

37:29.565 --> 37:31.807
But one must dine
with a certain savoir-faire.

37:31.985 --> 37:33.360
You won't get much out of it

37:33.528 --> 37:36.613
if you're just some Philistine
walking in off the streets.

37:36.823 --> 37:39.231
Dude, fancy.

37:39.451 --> 37:42.868
Hello, my good man.
Reservation for Gardner.

37:43.039 --> 37:44.913
Of course.

37:45.083 --> 37:46.363
This way, please.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.206
So, um...

37:53.384 --> 37:55.922
- Would you order some wine for us?
- No.

37:56.137 --> 37:59.720
Let's get something straight.
lf you get drunk, the evening is over.

37:59.891 --> 38:03.095
And if you fondle, massage or cup
any portion of my body,

38:03.270 --> 38:04.894
the evening is over, got it?

38:05.105 --> 38:07.015
Man, you're like a total prude, huh?

38:07.233 --> 38:08.976
Yes, l am.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.358
- Would any one of you like a drink?
KlRBY: Yes.

38:13.531 --> 38:18.075
The lady and l
will have the Coca-Cola.

38:18.287 --> 38:20.956
Yeah, make sure the lady's
has a lot of Jack Daniels in it.

38:22.249 --> 38:25.369
Never order for your date.
lt's cheesy.

38:25.586 --> 38:28.160
And the lady will have the filet.

38:29.507 --> 38:32.877
Well, a toast.

38:34.304 --> 38:38.172
To this moment, too long delayed

38:38.392 --> 38:40.634
and too quick to pass.

38:41.938 --> 38:44.394
Hey, you guys.

38:44.566 --> 38:47.686
Hi. Well, what are you doing here?

38:47.861 --> 38:51.231
- We're having a date.
- Yes, what are you doing here?

38:51.407 --> 38:53.151
l'm looking for Kirby.
lt's his prom night.

38:53.326 --> 38:54.441
He left his camera at home.

38:54.619 --> 38:56.362
Kirby is here?

38:56.538 --> 38:58.661
Somewhere.
He said you told him about this place.

38:58.832 --> 39:00.825
Right, right, so l did.

39:01.043 --> 39:02.454
There he is. See you guys later.

39:02.670 --> 39:05.125
Wait. You know, maybe l should
take the camera to the boy.

39:05.297 --> 39:07.041
Seeing you here
will only embarrass him.

39:07.216 --> 39:09.256
Oh, please. He's used to that.

39:09.469 --> 39:11.129
Besides, the one
who should be embarrassed

39:11.304 --> 39:13.511
is that boy who's with his mother.

39:14.725 --> 39:18.011
Lana is such a great mom.
She really cares about her kids.

39:18.187 --> 39:19.812
She sure does.

39:19.981 --> 39:23.101
LANA:
What do you mean, she's with you?

39:25.487 --> 39:28.025
Will you excuse me a moment?

39:28.240 --> 39:29.319
Mom, would you cool out?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.442
How do you expect me to cool out
when you're--?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.196
- What are you, a hooker?
- What?

39:33.371 --> 39:34.699
- You're a hooker?
- No, l'm not.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.408
- She works for me.
- You're her pimp?

39:36.583 --> 39:40.118
- ls there a problem?
- No, everything's just fine.

39:40.337 --> 39:42.045
- You know this tramp?
- Yes, l do.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.335
- Frasier!
- l'm sorry!

39:43.507 --> 39:45.251
Lana, please,
it's all innocent enough.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.715
l only did this
in order to motivate the boy.

39:47.929 --> 39:49.886
- By promising him sex?
- You promised him sex?

39:50.056 --> 39:52.761
- You're getting sex?
- l did not promise him sex!

39:52.976 --> 39:54.636
LANA: You are coming with me!
- l'm not going.

39:54.811 --> 39:55.926
FRASlER:
Lana, let me explain.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.222
l set him up with Roz
in exchange for his studying.

39:58.399 --> 39:59.478
LANA:
That's disgusting!

39:59.650 --> 40:01.975
lt's no different than you
promising me a date with Claire

40:02.153 --> 40:04.027
- in exchange for tutoring Kirby.
- Excuse me?

40:04.489 --> 40:05.568
Claire...

40:05.782 --> 40:09.365
- You traded me like a commodity?
- Get off your high horse.

40:09.536 --> 40:12.324
- You tutored me to get to her?
- Kirby--

40:12.539 --> 40:14.746
l can't believe you used me, Lana.

40:14.959 --> 40:18.328
Get a little perspective here.
My son's here with a prostitute!

40:18.546 --> 40:20.539
lf you call me that
one more time, lady--

40:20.715 --> 40:23.835
- Listen, sister, l'll call you whatever--
- You dangle me like bait?

40:24.052 --> 40:25.712
- Who's the prostitute now?
- Who are you?

40:25.888 --> 40:27.382
- Sit down!
KlRBY: You said you cared,

40:27.598 --> 40:30.884
but you're just as big a liar as
Richard M. Nixon, our 37th president.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.768
l'm gonna have
to ask you all to leave.

40:32.979 --> 40:34.224
Fine with me. Kirby, let's go.

40:34.397 --> 40:35.975
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Well, l am.

40:36.149 --> 40:38.391
No, no, no, stop it, everybody!

40:41.947 --> 40:43.857
Fellow diners,

40:44.826 --> 40:48.610
if you will all bear with me
for just a moment, please.

40:48.788 --> 40:50.283
Kirby, you are going to pass history

40:50.457 --> 40:52.366
and you are going to graduate
from high school.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.494
Roz, you are getting
your Springsteen ticket.

40:54.670 --> 40:56.413
Lana, if there is anyone
with whom your son

40:56.589 --> 40:58.997
could expect to have a wholesome,
innocent and chaste date,

40:59.175 --> 41:00.290
it is Roz Doyle.

41:00.510 --> 41:06.015
Claire, the only reason Lana did what
she did was out of love for her son.

41:07.643 --> 41:11.641
And if l compromised my ethics,

41:12.231 --> 41:18.602
it was only because l found myself
so utterly beguiled by you.

41:18.822 --> 41:24.030
Frasier, you are a strange
and charming man.

41:25.871 --> 41:27.995
You have no idea.

41:31.962 --> 41:33.373
Hi, Lana, it's Frasier.

41:33.547 --> 41:35.207
Yeah, listen,
l was hoping that l could

41:35.382 --> 41:37.174
maybe switch times
with Kirby tomorrow.

41:37.343 --> 41:40.297
Say move it up to 4:00
just after school?

41:40.471 --> 41:42.630
Great, great, good.

41:42.807 --> 41:45.844
Well, Claire and l have plans,
you know.

41:46.019 --> 41:48.641
Yeah, l guess we are hitting it off.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.646
She said what about me?

41:53.361 --> 41:55.400
You're joking.

41:55.697 --> 41:57.903
Oh, you are joking.

41:59.492 --> 42:01.781
What did she say about me?

42:02.245 --> 42:04.037
Really?

42:04.581 --> 42:05.992
Well,

42:06.834 --> 42:11.378
l guess it just proves she's a sucker
for sophistication, taste,

42:11.548 --> 42:15.047
and dare l say it, Old World charm.

42:15.218 --> 42:17.045
MAN:
Hey, buddy.

42:18.597 --> 42:22.465
lf the cops come back around,
can l stash something in your bag?

42:24.145 --> 42:26.352
l'll have to call you back.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
