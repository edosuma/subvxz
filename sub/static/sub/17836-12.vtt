00:02.504 --> 00:03.994
- Where are you going?
- Paris.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.127
<i> Scott's leaving too.</i>

00:05.153 --> 00:06.933
<i> I'm here. I'm in Virginia.</i>

00:06.958 --> 00:10.327
I have to run a school and you
have to go enroll in one.

00:10.361 --> 00:14.633
I know that students have seen things
that don't come with an easy explanation.

00:14.845 --> 00:16.714
<i> I thought you
couldn't kill a Hellhound.</i>

00:17.024 --> 00:18.059
It's a fleur-de-lis.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.147
Oh, shit.

00:39.203 --> 00:40.238
Okay.

00:41.991 --> 00:43.122
Okay.

00:51.437 --> 00:53.440
Yeah, okay, all right, all right.

01:54.935 --> 01:56.237
Yeah.

02:02.919 --> 02:03.920
Come on!

04:54.824 --> 04:57.627
<i> We find them. We kill them.</i>

05:01.863 --> 05:03.632
<i> We kill them all.</i>

05:11.608 --> 05:13.911
<i> Did you know that a caged,
rabid dog will break its own teeth</i>

05:13.944 --> 05:15.713
<i> trying to chew through the bars?</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:24.891
Something that out-of-control
is better off dead.

05:30.028 --> 05:32.230
We can still catch him.

05:35.608 --> 05:36.829
Catch who?

05:37.302 --> 05:40.405
The killer. What are you thinking about?

05:42.072 --> 05:43.764
Getting the bullet to Argent.

05:44.074 --> 05:46.343
Even if he's the one who fired it?

05:46.377 --> 05:48.080
Especially if he's the one.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.952
Do you hear that?

05:53.985 --> 05:56.588
Heartbeats?

05:56.620 --> 05:58.656
A lot of them.

06:00.905 --> 06:02.073
They're here.

06:02.099 --> 06:03.101
Who?

06:06.129 --> 06:07.365
Hunters.

06:08.132 --> 06:09.834
Run.

06:09.867 --> 06:11.201
Scott, wait.

06:13.004 --> 06:14.006
Scott!

06:45.769 --> 06:47.004
Argh.

06:47.038 --> 06:49.007
Scott. Scott, it's me.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.376
It's me! Scott! Scott.

07:06.990 --> 07:10.961
Okay, okay. Come on. It's okay.
It's okay.

07:10.995 --> 07:14.499
Everybody, stay back. It's just a kid.

07:19.636 --> 07:21.439
What's wrong with his eyes?

07:22.507 --> 07:24.009
You heard the Sheriff. Stand down.

07:39.055 --> 07:40.558
I'm really sorry.

07:43.494 --> 07:45.130
You don't think they
saw anything, do you?

07:48.266 --> 07:49.567
No more than they're used to.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.836
You wanna tell me what happened here?

07:51.869 --> 07:52.904
He's a Hellhound.

07:52.937 --> 07:54.838
A dead Hellhound.

07:54.872 --> 07:56.374
Yep, got that.

07:56.406 --> 07:58.877
Well, I don't get it. I didn't
think you could kill a Hellhound.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.580
Looks a lot easier than we thought.

08:04.115 --> 08:05.417
You got anything you wanna add?

08:11.822 --> 08:12.957
Yeah...

08:14.257 --> 08:16.728
I don't think it was just any bullet.

08:20.398 --> 08:21.999
I hope not.

08:28.473 --> 08:30.776
Why didn't you say anything?

08:32.876 --> 08:35.179
Why didn't you say anything?

08:36.714 --> 08:39.049
Why didn't either of you say anything?

08:40.418 --> 08:41.952
Wait, was I supposed to say something?

08:41.985 --> 08:44.655
None of us said anything
because of Argent,

08:46.090 --> 08:48.660
and none of us are going to say
anything until we talk to him.

08:48.692 --> 08:50.061
Everybody good with that?

08:52.663 --> 08:54.499
As long as we talk to Argent soon.

08:54.532 --> 08:56.501
Immediately, would be preferable.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.001
- Premonition?
- Yeah.

08:58.034 --> 09:00.270
The one with the screaming, and
people killing each other?

09:00.303 --> 09:01.906
First we find Argent.

09:04.107 --> 09:05.909
I was saying that if we're talking about

09:05.942 --> 09:08.745
some sort of mythical
creature that's so powerful

09:08.778 --> 09:12.383
the only safe place to put
it is in the Wild Hunt,

09:12.416 --> 09:13.685
then we have a serious problem.

09:13.717 --> 09:15.252
Can we figure it out while
I'm running drills?

09:15.285 --> 09:18.722
Brett's meeting me to help the
freshmen that wanna make First Line.

09:18.755 --> 09:19.790
Brett?

09:20.658 --> 09:22.726
Incredibly hot Brett

09:22.759 --> 09:24.294
with the eight-pack abs?

09:24.327 --> 09:25.562
Pretty sure his name is just Brett.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.731
He has an eight-pack.

09:27.764 --> 09:32.169
Do you, do you know how hard it is for
the human body to have an eight-pack?

09:32.802 --> 09:34.706
God.

09:34.739 --> 09:36.574
Wait, why is he helping you?

09:36.606 --> 09:39.510
I couldn't get anyone else to volunteer.

09:39.543 --> 09:41.011
Well. Yeah, that's because

09:41.044 --> 09:42.913
there's no way any of 'em
are gonna make First Line.

09:42.947 --> 09:45.416
I mean, no one does before junior year.

09:45.448 --> 09:47.784
Scott did, and so did I.

09:47.817 --> 09:48.852
Yeah,

09:48.885 --> 09:51.655
with a little supernatural help.

09:54.457 --> 09:55.659
Thanks for the gear, Liam,

09:55.692 --> 09:58.462
and the drills, and
the chance, you know.

09:58.495 --> 09:59.865
Even if there really isn't one.

10:01.698 --> 10:03.734
Unless you practice.

10:03.768 --> 10:06.204
Like, today.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.939
I mean, you could totally have
a shot at making First Line.

10:08.972 --> 10:10.874
- Okay, whatever...
- Yeah. No, you all do, seriously.

10:10.908 --> 10:12.377
- You guys could do it, seriously.
- Come on.

10:12.409 --> 10:14.245
I've seen you guys out there,
you guys are gonna kill it.

10:14.278 --> 10:15.647
- Go Cyclones!
- See you all on the field.

10:15.679 --> 10:17.981
- Go lacrosse!
- Yay, sports!

10:19.149 --> 10:20.684
There you are!

10:20.717 --> 10:21.919
I've got openings tomorrow,

10:21.952 --> 10:24.221
if you're willing to talk, of course.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.124
Well, I don't
have anything to talk about.

10:26.157 --> 10:28.493
He has a lot to talk about.

10:28.525 --> 10:30.961
We all have things to talk about, Liam.

10:30.995 --> 10:32.730
You don't wanna start senior year with

10:32.763 --> 10:35.133
any heavy burden on your shoulders,

10:35.166 --> 10:36.701
do you?

10:36.734 --> 10:38.469
How about 2:00 p.m. tomorrow?

10:38.501 --> 10:39.536
Well, that's my study period.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.172
Which is why I suggested it.

10:43.341 --> 10:45.610
Just take the form and
think about it, okay?

10:46.409 --> 10:48.078
Hope to see you tomorrow.

10:48.111 --> 10:50.781
Remember, I have an open door policy.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.788
Sun Tzu? I love Sun Tzu!

10:58.755 --> 11:00.390
I mean, the strategy parts,

11:00.423 --> 11:02.793
not the "unfathomable plans" parts,

11:02.826 --> 11:05.062
but all his writings on the
serenity of leaders...

11:05.096 --> 11:07.765
Sorry, Mason, I've got an appointment.

11:34.557 --> 11:36.660
Come on, Aaron, let's go.

11:49.472 --> 11:50.774
Hey.

12:06.882 --> 12:07.942
Is that it?

12:08.003 --> 12:09.171
The sound you heard?

12:09.205 --> 12:10.708
No, it's something else.

12:13.109 --> 12:14.478
It could be any kind of public facility.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.313
A hospital, a fire station, or...

12:25.521 --> 12:26.956
Or a mental institution.

12:26.982 --> 12:28.918
Don't say it.

12:29.426 --> 12:30.928
Eichen House.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.726
The card readers on the doors?

12:33.797 --> 12:34.831
It's the Closed Unit.

12:34.864 --> 12:36.533
You're not going back to Eichen,

12:36.566 --> 12:37.968
and you're definitely not going
anywhere near the Closed Unit.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.369
What if there's a connection to the...

12:39.402 --> 12:40.637
dead Hellhound?

12:40.669 --> 12:41.704
What if you go there again

12:41.738 --> 12:43.050
and someone tries to kill you?

12:43.076 --> 12:45.108
Which, by the way, happens
every time you go in there!

12:45.140 --> 12:46.375
It's our only lead.

12:46.408 --> 12:48.010
I'm not letting you near that place.

12:48.043 --> 12:49.779
Then you come with me.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.247
Or...

12:52.581 --> 12:54.083
I can go alone.

12:59.589 --> 13:01.992
He's not answering our calls or texts,

13:02.024 --> 13:04.060
he's not home, he's not here.

13:04.094 --> 13:07.297
I mean, maybe Argent just
doesn't wanna be found?

13:09.432 --> 13:10.734
Well, he...

13:10.767 --> 13:12.269
He would have his
calendar on his laptop.

13:13.202 --> 13:15.204
If we crack the password...

13:15.238 --> 13:17.408
I didn't think you had it in you.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.215
"Gun!"

13:30.854 --> 13:32.355
"Lots of guns."

13:36.658 --> 13:37.860
"Hunter!"

13:40.128 --> 13:41.330
No,

13:41.364 --> 13:43.432
no, it's definitely not "hunter."

13:43.466 --> 13:45.201
I mean, 'cause why would it be hunter

13:45.235 --> 13:47.003
because Argent's not even
a hunter anymore, so...

13:47.036 --> 13:51.007
I mean, there's not even hunters for
werewolves at all anymore, right?

13:51.039 --> 13:54.877
So why would anybody think that
there was a hunter in the woods

13:54.911 --> 13:56.713
when it was actually just deputies?

13:57.980 --> 13:59.283
What?

13:59.948 --> 14:01.650
Nothing.

14:08.057 --> 14:11.295
Uh, Malia, I, I don't think that
Argent took off from Beacon Hills.

14:12.828 --> 14:15.231
I think he's back in business.

14:25.975 --> 14:27.911
I think I know what his password is.

14:33.216 --> 14:35.451
Course I know him. It's Halwyn.

14:36.119 --> 14:38.220
He almost killed me,

14:38.254 --> 14:41.557
and burned an orderly to
death in the process.

14:41.591 --> 14:42.993
He was a patient?

14:43.025 --> 14:44.927
Until he checked out.

14:44.961 --> 14:46.864
Checked out. You can do that?

14:48.364 --> 14:49.899
When you build the place, you can.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.370
He did it in 1912, so
he'd always have a room.

14:53.403 --> 14:55.672
1912? That would
make him over 100 years old.

14:58.341 --> 14:59.942
No one knew his actual age.

14:59.975 --> 15:01.845
And he's been here the whole time?

15:01.878 --> 15:04.080
In a state of hibernation.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.816
In case it got out.

15:06.849 --> 15:09.419
It? What's "it?"

15:12.721 --> 15:13.856
I never asked.

15:21.965 --> 15:23.200
That's odd.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.273
Something's wrong.

15:31.307 --> 15:34.211
Help me. Please.

15:34.244 --> 15:37.547
Help me. Please...

15:37.580 --> 15:38.982
What're you waiting for? Hurry!

15:39.014 --> 15:41.183
There's something in here.

15:41.216 --> 15:42.384
I'm locking this unit down.

15:42.418 --> 15:43.519
You need to open the gate.

15:43.552 --> 15:44.821
If you think I'm opening this up,

15:44.854 --> 15:46.657
then you belong in there.

15:48.957 --> 15:50.427
Open the gate.

16:19.922 --> 16:21.992
Oh!

16:22.024 --> 16:23.927
That's called a perfect hitch.

16:45.014 --> 16:46.450
Perfect split dodge.

16:59.928 --> 17:01.697
Perfect rocker.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.300
Just remember to cover your back,

17:04.333 --> 17:07.036
especially if your opponent's a dick.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.839
You got some pretty big cleats
to fill with Scott leaving.

17:09.871 --> 17:11.473
You ready for all this?

17:11.506 --> 17:12.842
I managed all summer.

17:13.376 --> 17:15.045
Summer's over.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.813
Corey's been practicing all
summer to play goalie.

17:50.847 --> 17:52.516
He's actually gotten really good.

17:57.853 --> 17:59.621
The season doesn't start
for at least a week.

17:59.655 --> 18:00.990
Thank God.

18:08.164 --> 18:10.367
Um, was that Liam, Brett, or Corey?

18:10.399 --> 18:12.067
I think that was all of them.

18:15.871 --> 18:17.373
You're losing it, dude.

19:15.031 --> 19:17.533
There he is. That's the IED I remember.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.168
What's it stand for?

19:19.202 --> 19:20.870
Intermittent Explosive Disorder?

19:20.902 --> 19:23.139
What's it gonna take for
you to explode, Liam?

19:26.676 --> 19:28.912
I'm trying to help you.
You're not in control,

19:28.945 --> 19:31.881
and if you don't fix it,
someone's gonna get hurt.

20:02.378 --> 20:04.080
I'm not actually invisible
right now, am I?

20:19.556 --> 20:22.742
This is Deputy Parrish with the
Beacon Hills Sheriff's Department.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.570
Is anybody in here?

20:26.637 --> 20:28.840
It's in here.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.543
There's something in here.

21:04.576 --> 21:05.985
Where are you?

21:09.147 --> 21:10.363
Help me.

21:10.615 --> 21:12.083
Ahhh!

21:19.723 --> 21:21.527
- It's here.
- What's here?

21:26.063 --> 21:27.064
We have to get her out.

21:28.066 --> 21:29.534
Why would I do that?

21:29.567 --> 21:31.136
I'm the one that put her here.

21:39.511 --> 21:41.012
The sun.

21:41.044 --> 21:42.913
The moon. The truth.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.251
The sun.

21:48.852 --> 21:49.887
The sun.

21:50.989 --> 21:51.990
The moon!

21:53.524 --> 21:54.759
The moon!

22:07.338 --> 22:10.942
Major Delane is my
contact at Camp Robertson.

22:10.974 --> 22:13.477
I'm surprised he didn't tell me
about the change in protocol.

22:13.511 --> 22:16.214
Well, the Major got promoted
and was promptly shipped overseas.

22:16.246 --> 22:17.916
Huh?

22:17.948 --> 22:19.618
Didn't know the Army worked that fast.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.786
They do when they want to.

22:23.588 --> 22:26.558
The Major's not Army, he's a Marine.

22:29.961 --> 22:33.031
Who sent you? Who's
buying all this weaponry?

22:33.063 --> 22:35.065
We don't need to have a situation.

22:35.098 --> 22:36.233
We already do.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.202
See, I don't sell to weekend warriors.

22:38.235 --> 22:40.871
You want these guns,
you'll answer my question.

22:40.905 --> 22:44.076
We're taking the guns, and
the ammo, and the crates.

22:48.846 --> 22:50.482
If you knew anything about guns,

22:50.514 --> 22:51.782
you'd know they're not loaded.

22:59.256 --> 23:00.958
We brought our own.

23:00.992 --> 23:03.427
And I always have a backup plan.

23:07.331 --> 23:09.633
- What the hell are you guys doing here?
- We're your backup.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.368
I had a guy on the inside.

23:11.402 --> 23:13.205
- Who?
- You're standing on him.

23:21.212 --> 23:22.281
Get down!

24:17.268 --> 24:18.270
Who are the guns for?

24:51.202 --> 24:52.537
For the record,

24:52.570 --> 24:54.705
I had everything under control.

24:55.339 --> 24:56.741
Clearly.

24:56.773 --> 24:59.110
- How did you find me?
- He did it.

25:01.044 --> 25:02.813
You left your computer in the bunker.

25:03.580 --> 25:04.782
Ah.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.886
I guess I need a new password.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.556
You know, I go home every night,

25:11.589 --> 25:12.691
thinking to myself

25:12.723 --> 25:15.460
I survived another day in that place.

25:15.493 --> 25:17.262
Then I come back every morning

25:17.294 --> 25:20.230
to protect people like
me from things like you.

25:23.201 --> 25:26.004
Then I realized we
shouldn't be caging them,

25:26.037 --> 25:27.739
we should be killing them,

25:27.772 --> 25:30.474
eradicating them to
protect the rest of us.

25:32.009 --> 25:34.579
You don't have a
cell in here that can hold me.

25:34.611 --> 25:37.748
Deputy, you're not our first Hellhound.

25:50.227 --> 25:53.063
Human body is 60% water.

25:53.097 --> 25:56.167
Even you can freeze
solid, Deputy Parrish.

26:11.916 --> 26:13.350
I think you dropped this.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.186
I saw you playing.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.957
You're something else, aren't you?

26:18.990 --> 26:20.925
Something like that, yeah.

26:31.301 --> 26:32.669
I'm sorry.

26:32.703 --> 26:34.473
I should've told you.

26:39.676 --> 26:41.279
It's wolfsbane.

26:51.368 --> 26:52.983
_

28:01.986 --> 28:03.188
Hello.

28:07.346 --> 28:10.616
<i> Even you can
freeze solid, Deputy Parrish.</i>

28:10.650 --> 28:12.152
<i> We should be killing them.</i>

28:15.308 --> 28:18.579
I have nothing against you personally.

28:22.197 --> 28:25.453
But you don't deserve to
have this much power.

28:26.027 --> 28:29.064
You don't deserve to terrify people.

28:37.724 --> 28:39.261
That's incredible!

28:45.218 --> 28:47.143
No one should be able to do that.

28:58.597 --> 29:01.236
I haven't been avoiding
you, I've been busy.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.536
Business is booming, and
I'd like to know why.

29:03.663 --> 29:05.832
Have you made any
unusual sales recently?

29:06.629 --> 29:08.431
Like a bullet with a fleur-de-lis?

29:13.212 --> 29:16.207
I haven't stamped a bullet
since Allison died.

29:16.449 --> 29:18.151
Someone just killed a
Hellhound with one.

29:19.184 --> 29:20.386
Can I see the casing?

29:31.325 --> 29:32.899
It must've fallen out.

29:32.931 --> 29:34.167
You don't need the casing,

29:34.572 --> 29:35.824
you need the slug.

29:37.202 --> 29:40.540
Find that, and you'll find your killer.

30:14.239 --> 30:15.808
Hey, guys. What're you doing here?

30:15.842 --> 30:17.177
Just looking for you.

30:17.209 --> 30:21.046
History test tomorrow? We need to study.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.483
Yeah, right.

30:23.516 --> 30:25.485
That's probably a good idea

30:25.517 --> 30:27.220
since I have no idea what it's on.

30:31.724 --> 30:35.195
It's on Mussolini and the role of
fear-baiting in the rise of fascism.

30:35.228 --> 30:36.329
We can study together.

30:36.362 --> 30:37.898
Yeah, can we take the test together?

30:37.930 --> 30:39.732
Hey.

30:40.098 --> 30:41.100
Guys...

32:08.171 --> 32:09.717
- Library's empty.
- Gym too.

32:09.751 --> 32:11.552
Aaron is the only one
I can't get a hold of.

32:11.586 --> 32:14.087
Anyone check the parking lot?
See if his car's still there?

32:24.799 --> 32:27.051
As a doctor, I've never liked guns.

32:28.636 --> 32:30.805
I've always believed there
were far better ways

32:30.838 --> 32:32.156
to solve our problems.

32:34.675 --> 32:36.893
I guess I'm having a crisis of faith.

33:06.005 --> 33:07.398
Hello?

33:20.288 --> 33:21.957
<i> Why'd you pick me?</i>

33:42.175 --> 33:43.310
Jordan?

34:03.498 --> 34:05.634
Hello? Hello?

34:18.946 --> 34:20.748
<i> It's here.</i>

34:20.781 --> 34:22.550
<i> We should be killing them.</i>

34:22.581 --> 34:25.518
<i> Killing them. Killing them.</i>

34:27.621 --> 34:29.791
<i> Wait!</i>

34:49.676 --> 34:53.447
I can't be afraid anymore.

35:27.448 --> 35:28.817
Okay, I'm not good with subtlety.

35:28.850 --> 35:30.552
What the hell happened last night?

35:30.584 --> 35:32.153
Yeah.

35:32.907 --> 35:34.239
I get it,

35:35.256 --> 35:36.457
I freaked out.

35:38.568 --> 35:40.771
- Which freaked you out.
- So you admit that you freaked out?

35:43.168 --> 35:44.565
Wait a minute, I didn't freak out.

35:44.598 --> 35:46.066
You haven't been trying
to get me to talk

35:46.100 --> 35:47.535
because you're freaked
out that I freaked out?

35:47.568 --> 35:50.533
No, I've been trying to
get you to talk because,

35:51.079 --> 35:52.646
you know, I'm...

35:53.008 --> 35:54.510
Well, I'm worried about you.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.383
Uh, I'm okay.

36:01.348 --> 36:02.415
Thanks.

36:11.318 --> 36:14.257
I was hunted by my dad.

36:14.833 --> 36:16.609
I was hunted by my girlfriend's dad.

36:23.704 --> 36:25.173
Does that fear ever go away?

36:29.075 --> 36:31.806
What if I told you I saw a
red laser sight right now?

36:32.613 --> 36:34.983
I'd say that you are seriously...

36:36.156 --> 36:37.624
not paranoid.

36:37.885 --> 36:40.384
Relax, it's just me.

36:42.256 --> 36:43.825
Do you have to use that thing?

36:43.858 --> 36:47.262
To determine the trajectory
of the bullet, yes.

36:48.963 --> 36:50.648
Show me where you found the body.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.841
Take it easy,

37:05.867 --> 37:07.184
safety's on.

37:11.754 --> 37:12.957
Got it.

37:13.967 --> 37:15.606
Scott, do me a favor.

37:16.089 --> 37:18.873
Glow your eyes, tell me
if you can see it, too.

37:25.298 --> 37:26.300
I see it.

37:28.836 --> 37:30.738
That's because it's made from an element

37:30.771 --> 37:33.053
with a higher heat signature
than regular metal.

37:34.425 --> 37:35.961
It shines infrared,

37:37.077 --> 37:38.079
like your eyes,

37:42.502 --> 37:44.023
because it's silver.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.049
Aaron?

38:09.409 --> 38:11.578
- Hey, guys.
- Thank God you're okay.

38:12.049 --> 38:13.218
Where have you been?

38:13.445 --> 38:15.382
I forgot we have a
history test tomorrow.

38:15.415 --> 38:16.988
We've been trying to call you.

38:19.751 --> 38:22.399
Huh. Must've died.

38:33.099 --> 38:34.801
How come no one's saying anything?

38:34.833 --> 38:36.368
Silver, copper, lead.

38:36.402 --> 38:37.637
Who cares what a bullet's made out of?

38:37.670 --> 38:39.324
Don't they all do the same thing?

38:40.683 --> 38:43.957
Well, there's a myth that a silver
bullet can kill a werewolf.

38:44.376 --> 38:47.412
But a real hunter
would know it's just a myth.

38:47.980 --> 38:50.746
Silver's too soft for bullets,
they don't fly straight.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.986
If you didn't fire it, then who did?

38:55.714 --> 38:57.592
Someone who doesn't know
what they're doing.

38:58.014 --> 38:59.916
Someone dangerous.

39:03.096 --> 39:04.298
A new hunter.

39:05.864 --> 39:08.400
He killed every supernatural
in the Closed Unit?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.636
All of them?

39:10.902 --> 39:12.938
He said he couldn't
see it any other way.

39:12.971 --> 39:15.875
Well, I've got another way.
You don't kill everyone.

39:16.842 --> 39:18.339
I think he was afraid.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.581
The wolves, the rats.

39:27.085 --> 39:29.388
It keeps coming back to
the same thing, fear.

39:29.422 --> 39:30.924
But what is everyone afraid of?

39:41.601 --> 39:42.803
Us.

39:45.771 --> 39:48.641
<i> We don't know what fear
would do to somebody.</i>

39:49.641 --> 39:51.543
<i> I mean, it can change them.</i>

39:51.576 --> 39:53.980
<i> They'll look at us differently.</i>

39:55.748 --> 39:57.150
<i> They'll do things that
they've never done before.</i>

39:58.351 --> 39:59.953
People can be so stupid.

39:59.985 --> 40:02.454
They're not stupid, they're scared.

40:02.487 --> 40:03.723
And scared people will do things

40:03.755 --> 40:05.093
that you wouldn't believe.

40:47.766 --> 40:49.402
Who's there?

40:51.325 --> 40:52.326
Who are you?

40:56.375 --> 40:59.279
Someone who has been doing
this a lot longer than you,

41:02.648 --> 41:06.251
but also someone who
recognizes raw talent

41:06.284 --> 41:08.187
when he sees it.
