00:29.315 --> 00:30.666
Have a nice day.

01:39.159 --> 01:40.459
Mr. Tideman.

02:08.263 --> 02:12.100
Mr. Lasky?
AW3 Marty Padanski.

02:46.765 --> 02:50.060
Mr. Lasky? I'm Richard Tideman's
executive assistant.

02:50.101 --> 02:52.479
- Glad to know ya. Are you going with me?
- No.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.856
Mr. Tideman just wanted
to see you off.

02:56.107 --> 02:58.445
- Is that him in the car?
- Yes.

02:59.236 --> 03:01.698
Well, we've never met.
Can I introduce myself?

03:01.781 --> 03:03.908
It isn't necessary,
Mr. Lasky.

03:04.033 --> 03:07.454
As I said,
he came to see you off.

03:07.537 --> 03:10.707
Well, thank him for me.

04:05.183 --> 04:07.227
Take a look, sir.

04:11.441 --> 04:14.529
Arizona Memorial.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.757
She's now resting in 33 feet of water
in an upright position.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.512
There were only 289 survivors.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.441
Russian trawler.

04:50.777 --> 04:53.362
What's it doing?

04:53.446 --> 04:55.782
Not doing
much fishing!

07:00.879 --> 07:02.214
I'll take it, sir.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.258
Mr. Lasky, I'm Commander
Dan Thurman, executive officer.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.720
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.055
Now follow me
to the Bridge.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.767
Stand clear, spot 3.

07:12.851 --> 07:16.395
Helo-733, rotating.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.398
- Give me 25 knots of wind over the deck.
- Aye, Captain.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.525
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full, aye.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.865
- Indicate 100 R.P.M.
- Indicate 100 R.P.M. Aye, sir.

07:25.949 --> 07:29.035
Central Bridge,
all ahead full, 100 R.P.M.

07:29.119 --> 07:32.123
- Continue fixed wing recovery.
- Aye, Captain.

07:32.164 --> 07:34.291
Let's bring the Kag aboard.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.419
Victor-200,
your signal is Charlie.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.507
- Set 52, Tomcat.
- Set 52, Tomcat.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.722
T-minus 30 seconds.

07:49.599 --> 07:55.857
Tomcat 200.
I'm on approach and lining up.

07:55.899 --> 07:57.984
Gear coming down.

08:05.116 --> 08:08.078
200, slightly right.

08:10.455 --> 08:11.707
Gear down and locked.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.377
Add power. Power.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.587
All indicators green.

08:16.671 --> 08:18.423
Hold there.

08:19.674 --> 08:22.303
Hold it. Slightly left.

08:23.721 --> 08:26.098
In the groove. Looks good.

09:13.567 --> 09:18.240
In the port, Cat 1. Get below.
We still have aircraft to land.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.367
I hear you're on assignment
from Tideman Industries

09:20.450 --> 09:21.743
to the Defense Department, right?

09:21.869 --> 09:23.829
- Yeah, that's right.
- What is your job, Mr. Lasky?

09:23.954 --> 09:27.666
- I'm a systems analyst.
- Oh, efficiency expert, right?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.878
Yeah, you could say that.

09:38.387 --> 09:41.098
- That's a quick change in the weather.
- Yeah!

09:41.181 --> 09:42.557
Sure is.

09:50.275 --> 09:55.281
- Hi, Kag.
- It's getting a little strange out there, boys.

09:55.406 --> 09:57.658
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Captain.

09:57.741 --> 10:01.579
- Are we headed for a squall?
- Not an official one.

10:01.621 --> 10:03.916
Sir, this is Commander Damon,
operations officer.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.043
- How do you do, Mr. Lasky?
- Fine, thank you.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.086
And Lieutenant Perry,
officer of the deck.

10:08.211 --> 10:09.379
- How do you do, sir?
- Good, sir.

10:09.504 --> 10:10.755
Mr. Lasky is going to be
taking a look

10:10.839 --> 10:13.008
at how we do things
here aboard the Nimitz.

10:13.091 --> 10:15.386
- We'll give you whatever help we can, sir.
- Thank you.

10:15.428 --> 10:18.431
Our departure
was delayed two days

10:18.514 --> 10:22.060
- at the request of your mysterious boss.
- I'm sorry about that, Captain

10:22.143 --> 10:24.855
but I'm afraid Mr. Richard Tideman
is as much a mystery to me

10:24.939 --> 10:28.318
- as he is to the rest of the world.
- Two days.

10:28.443 --> 10:30.904
Perhaps the fact that Tideman
helped design and build this ship

10:30.946 --> 10:33.448
affords him some
special privileges.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.285
Corporal Kullman will escort you
while you're aboard ship.

10:37.368 --> 10:39.496
- Right this way, sir.
- Oh, Mr. Lasky?

10:39.580 --> 10:42.042
I'd be delighted if
you'd join me for dinner.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.087
Thank you, Captain.
I'd like that.

11:05.858 --> 11:09.487
Am I mistaken, or was Black Cloud's
forecast this morning

11:09.570 --> 11:14.284
- for clear skies and sunshine?
- I'll bet he wishes it wasn't, sir.

11:14.368 --> 11:16.786
Hand me that weather report,
please.

11:17.871 --> 11:20.290
Thank you.

11:36.518 --> 11:39.272
What do you think it is?

11:39.355 --> 11:43.192
It wasn't there
on the morning run.

11:43.317 --> 11:46.445
Check all projection lenses,
and if it's not there, check all receivers.

11:46.529 --> 11:48.531
Aye, aye, sir.

12:08.469 --> 12:11.222
The Nimitz. Who's that?

12:11.347 --> 12:14.059
- A Russian trawler.
- What's he want?

12:14.142 --> 12:17.313
A big fish!

12:17.396 --> 12:20.024
You've been assigned
Navigator's inport cabin, sir.

12:20.150 --> 12:23.196
Connects with Commander Owens,
our air wing commander.

12:24.363 --> 12:27.158
Your luggage has
been delivered, sir.

12:27.241 --> 12:29.953
I'll be just outside, sir,
if there's anything you need.

12:30.078 --> 12:31.412
Thank you.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.663
Hello?

13:33.439 --> 13:36.442
"'Pacific At War,
Commander Richard T. Owens."

13:45.952 --> 13:47.954
Very well.

13:49.373 --> 13:52.543
We're having communication problems
with the incoming flights.

13:52.668 --> 13:55.838
- What do you mean?
- It's interference from the storm, sir.

13:55.963 --> 13:58.967
- Get Black Cloud up here.
- Yes, sir.

14:01.054 --> 14:04.348
Sunshine and clear skies.

14:11.689 --> 14:14.901
- Anything else you'd like to see?
- I beg your pardon.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.154
What the hell are you
doing in my cabin?

14:17.279 --> 14:18.281
I'm terribly sorry.

14:18.364 --> 14:20.491
You're Commander Owens.
I'm Warren Lasky.

14:20.575 --> 14:21.992
They put me next door.

14:23.078 --> 14:27.083
Mr. Lasky, the one thing
we cherish aboard a ship is privacy.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.293
Maybe it's because we get
so damn little of it.

14:29.376 --> 14:32.171
I understand.
I hope you'll forgive me.

14:33.089 --> 14:36.758
You know, from what I've read,
your manuscript is very good:

14:36.842 --> 14:37.884
I mean, really very good.

14:38.009 --> 14:40.888
Thank you.
You a historian, Mr. Lasky?

14:40.930 --> 14:44.727
I'm a little bit of everything, I guess.
I work for Tideman Industries.

14:44.810 --> 14:47.020
What exactly is your job
aboard this ship?

14:47.105 --> 14:49.732
Very simply, I look at the way
you people do things

14:49.815 --> 14:51.359
and if I can think
of any alternatives

14:51.400 --> 14:56.406
I write it up and submit a report
to the Department of Defense.

14:56.531 --> 14:58.992
Think you'll find some?

14:59.075 --> 15:02.454
Well, there are always
alternatives, Commander.

15:02.537 --> 15:05.582
Mr. Lasky, please don't
look for them in here.

15:07.751 --> 15:09.712
Excuse me.

15:25.855 --> 15:27.899
Boss, Kag's here.

15:28.941 --> 15:30.443
George, any further word
from Stanton?

15:30.485 --> 15:33.739
We know he's inbound, but we can't
talk to him. His radios are garbled.

15:33.864 --> 15:37.411
Just wish he had more experience.

15:37.494 --> 15:40.079
Yes, Captain.
Yes, sir. He's right here.

15:40.164 --> 15:42.749
- Kag?
- Yes, Skipper?

15:42.874 --> 15:45.835
- How many planes have you got in the air?
- Just one, sir.

15:45.919 --> 15:48.922
- Our newest pilot, Stanton.
- Well, get him aboard as fast as you can.

15:48.963 --> 15:51.342
- I want to get out of this weather.
- Right away, Skipper.

15:51.426 --> 15:53.886
- He wants him down now. Keep trying.
- Corsair, 412.

15:53.928 --> 15:56.931
Air Ops Primary, try again on 412.
See if you can reach him.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.989
Take a look
at the scope, sir.

16:13.114 --> 16:16.118
The water temperature's
down five degrees

16:16.203 --> 16:19.207
and even the barometer's
giving improper readings.

16:19.248 --> 16:21.960
It should be down,
and it's way up.

16:24.504 --> 16:27.924
- What the hell is that?
- It seems to have a cycle, sir.

16:28.007 --> 16:31.220
One run it's there,
the next one is clear.

16:31.345 --> 16:36.058
One run it's there, the next one is clear.
I've never seen anything like it.

16:36.141 --> 16:39.019
Turn those destroyers around
and head them back to Pearl Harbor.

16:39.144 --> 16:41.981
- No need for them to go through this.
- Yes, sir.

16:42.022 --> 16:44.817
Keep it in the wind till we get
that Corsair aboard.

16:44.859 --> 16:46.319
It's one of our new pilots.

16:46.361 --> 16:49.573
All units in Romeo Alpha,
this is Kilo Bravo.

17:02.254 --> 17:06.715
This is 412. I have an unsafe
hook indicator. Over.

17:06.799 --> 17:09.345
412, roger. Unsafe hook.
Recycle your hook.

17:09.387 --> 17:12.013
Negative.
I've tried that.

17:12.055 --> 17:15.395
412, your transmission's poor.
Say your fuel's state.

17:15.478 --> 17:18.522
Captain Boss, that Corsair's in real trouble.
Can't get his tail hook down.

17:18.564 --> 17:20.691
- I think we better take him in the barricade.
- Rig it!

17:20.775 --> 17:23.694
Air Ops, tri-flight.
On the flight deck!

17:23.736 --> 17:27.448
We have an A-7 Corsair in trouble.
Can't get his hook down.

17:27.531 --> 17:32.663
This is not a drill.

17:32.746 --> 17:36.417
Repeat, this is not a drill.
Now rig the barricade!

17:36.500 --> 17:40.712
Bow deck! Bow deck!
This is no drill!

17:40.796 --> 17:43.800
All right! Let's go!

17:43.925 --> 17:46.594
Go on! Let's hustle now!

17:58.650 --> 18:01.736
All personnel
off the deck now!

18:03.530 --> 18:06.866
Barricade coming up.
Clear the area!

18:06.950 --> 18:09.035
Clear the flight deck!

18:16.753 --> 18:19.923
- Do you see him out there yet?
- Yeah, there he is!

18:19.965 --> 18:23.427
Head's up! Green deck,
land aircraft.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.764
My God. Look at that.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.877
Have Central come up on the J.A.

20:09.712 --> 20:11.880
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, aye.

20:11.964 --> 20:14.467
Central Bridge,
pick up the J.A.

20:16.885 --> 20:19.097
- Aye, sir.
- Where's that plane?

20:19.180 --> 20:23.102
I don't see it,
Captain.

20:28.483 --> 20:31.151
Sound general quarters.

20:31.235 --> 20:33.321
- Aye, Captain. Boatswain.
- Boatswain mate. Aye, sir.

20:33.404 --> 20:35.449
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, sir.

20:45.459 --> 20:46.919
General quarters,
general quarters.

20:47.003 --> 20:49.088
All hands,
man your battle stations.

20:49.130 --> 20:52.717
Go up and forward on your starboard side,
down and aft on your port side.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.219
General quarters,
general quarters.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.191
Time plus two minutes.

21:17.287 --> 21:21.792
- What the hell's goin' on?
- General quarters, sir. Come with me.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.920
Time plus three minutes.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.807
Time plus four.

21:35.848 --> 21:38.560
Report when all stations
are manned and ready.

21:38.685 --> 21:42.104
Got him right there!
Comin' in! A-7 Corsair!

21:44.775 --> 21:47.402
Heads up on deck!
He's in bound to the barricade.

21:47.485 --> 21:49.697
Green jackets
to the barricade.

22:00.292 --> 22:02.712
We can't hear you.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.809
All right.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.407
Crash on deck! Crash on deck!
All personnel respond now!

22:29.449 --> 22:32.244
Let's get out there
and watch for fire!

22:34.246 --> 22:38.208
Red shirts, front and center!
Move it, move it!

22:39.753 --> 22:42.672
Move it!

22:42.756 --> 22:45.634
- Go back to course 350.
- Aye, aye, sir.

23:03.069 --> 23:05.114
Okay! Take 'er down!

23:05.197 --> 23:09.286
All personnel on the Flight Deck,
let's turn to.

23:13.290 --> 23:17.044
Blue shirts, locks and chains
on the aircraft.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.640
Is this the last known position
of our destroyers before the storm?

23:28.723 --> 23:31.392
- Yes, sir, Captain.
- Skipper.

23:31.475 --> 23:34.938
Dan, go down and check out
the Threat Board.

23:35.021 --> 23:39.194
- Keep me posted.
- Right.

23:39.319 --> 23:41.154
- Get Kag up here.
- Yes, sir.

23:41.196 --> 23:43.406
I want to talk
to CI NPAC Fleet.

23:43.489 --> 23:47.202
Captain, we're down across the board.
Antennas check out, but we're off the air.

23:47.327 --> 23:49.706
- Any word from our destroyers?
- We aren't getting anything

23:49.831 --> 23:52.416
except some code transmissions
in the 200-meter band.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.169
Otherwise, we're dead
as a doornail.

23:55.252 --> 23:57.964
- Ops, what's our radar picture?
- Radar shows us clear, sir.

23:58.047 --> 24:01.008
Clear? Can't you see
that Russian trawler?

24:01.133 --> 24:03.512
I have the signal officer
on deck, but no visual sighting, sir.

24:03.637 --> 24:06.515
Keep me advised.
Navigator, what's our posi?

24:06.640 --> 24:10.478
270, Captain.
280 miles west of Pearl Harbor.

24:10.519 --> 24:15.149
Oh, Dick. Launch a Hawkeye
to check ship's communications

24:15.233 --> 24:18.946
a Crusader to make a photo run over
Pearl and put two Tomcats on ready alert.

24:19.029 --> 24:22.157
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Captain! Captain!

24:22.241 --> 24:24.493
Hey, what happened?

24:24.576 --> 24:27.538
Frankly, I don't know.

24:27.663 --> 24:31.042
Lieutenant, have the heads
of all departments

24:31.084 --> 24:32.754
meet me at C.V.I.C.
immediately after the launch.

24:32.879 --> 24:33.921
Aye, aye, sir.

24:34.005 --> 24:38.175
- Mr. Lasky, I want you to stay with me.
- Captain's off the Bridge.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.677
It's a code.

24:40.762 --> 24:42.889
Can you break it,
Chief?

24:42.972 --> 24:46.601
- I think someone's putting us on.
- Why?

24:46.685 --> 24:49.980
Because I learned this code
at Great Lakes. It's ancient.

24:50.063 --> 24:52.900
Thanks, Chief.

24:52.983 --> 24:56.695
Stand clear at 012.
Hawkeye rotating.

25:20.514 --> 25:23.017
Off the bow, stand clear.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.228
736 lifting for plane guard.

25:50.964 --> 25:52.924
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

25:53.049 --> 25:55.134
- Go hold your own!
- Who said that?

25:55.259 --> 25:57.721
Chrissakes, Chief, all we want to know
is what's going on.

25:57.805 --> 26:00.308
- Whatever it is, you'll be told.
- When?

26:00.391 --> 26:03.562
- As soon as the skipper's ready.
- That's what they always say!

26:07.274 --> 26:10.988
Hey, Ex-O, what's goin' on?
Attention on deck!

26:11.071 --> 26:13.156
Carry on.

26:17.786 --> 26:23.877
Gentlemen, we're at general quarters,
because I don't have any idea what's happened.

26:24.002 --> 26:27.505
But I don't exclude
the possibility of war.

26:27.588 --> 26:32.426
- A nuclear strike?
- Possibility.

26:32.510 --> 26:36.097
- Now, what action's been taken?
- Well, Skipper

26:36.180 --> 26:37.681
there's nothing on the Threat Board

26:37.807 --> 26:39.935
and there's been no
significant damage to the ship.

26:40.019 --> 26:43.438
- The crew's in good shape.
- Air wing is intact. First team's ready to go.

26:43.522 --> 26:46.108
E-2 is now showing the area clear,
and reconnaissance aircraft

26:46.191 --> 26:47.943
should be coming up on Pearl, sir.

26:49.194 --> 26:51.990
The reactor is stable.
All readings are normal.

26:52.033 --> 26:54.743
Capable for maximum speed,
Captain.

26:54.827 --> 26:57.330
- Lloyd.
- We can transmit and receive

26:57.372 --> 26:59.833
- but we haven't been able to reach anybody.
- Why's that?

26:59.917 --> 27:02.377
Tried everybody in the book...
CINPAC, Joint Chiefs...

27:02.419 --> 27:04.254
I even took a crack
at the White House.

27:04.337 --> 27:06.340
Now, we do have some low-band
transmissions...

27:06.424 --> 27:08.259
strictly manual
stuff with very low power.

27:08.342 --> 27:11.012
We'll have to do some retuning
to transmit in that range.

27:11.137 --> 27:12.680
Get on with it!

27:12.721 --> 27:15.934
- Ops?
- All radar's up, all weapon systems check out.

27:16.059 --> 27:22.024
- We're ready, sir.
- Mr. Lasky. You have anything to add?

27:22.066 --> 27:24.234
- No, sir, not at this time.
- Skipper.

27:24.359 --> 27:27.362
I have a reconnaissance report
coming in now, sir.

27:29.573 --> 27:34.036
Flight level 250.
Camera rolling.

27:34.078 --> 27:39.709
There doesn't appear to be any damage.
Seems to be some unusual shipping traffiic.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.963
I'll make another pass
for a close-up series.

27:42.088 --> 27:45.174
- Over.
- E.T.A. to Nimitz, 12 minutes, sir.

27:45.257 --> 27:48.803
Skipper, we're picking up some weird
traffic on the A.M. broadcast band

27:48.887 --> 27:51.890
on the entertainment circuit,
but the signal strength is very weak.

27:51.932 --> 27:55.979
Boss, I told you. I tried and tried,
and I can't get Carmichael to go to sleep.

27:56.104 --> 27:58.731
Rochester, that polar bear's
got to go to sleep.

27:58.772 --> 28:00.900
- He's supposed to hibernate.
- Jack Benny?

28:00.984 --> 28:04.071
Where is he now?

28:04.196 --> 28:06.865
Sittin'up in bed,
readin' Esquire.

28:06.949 --> 28:09.659
Esquire? Well,
take it away from him.

28:09.743 --> 28:14.456
Oh, come now, boss.
He's been around.

28:14.539 --> 28:16.918
Lloyd, tape and monitor
all transmissions.

28:17.002 --> 28:20.505
Ops, I want a closer look on all air,
surface and subsurface contacts

28:20.630 --> 28:22.715
within 250 miles
of this ship.

28:22.798 --> 28:26.302
Dick, put some tankers and a medium-sized
strike force on a 30-minute alert.

28:26.427 --> 28:28.388
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Any questions?

28:28.471 --> 28:32.560
Skipper, the ship is still at general quarters.
Request permission to go to condition 3.

28:32.644 --> 28:37.107
Granted. I'll be on the Bridge.
I want answers.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.402
Attention on deck!

28:45.950 --> 28:49.912
Secure from general quarters.
Set condition 3.

29:23.491 --> 29:26.244
- I stand relieved.
- Very well.

29:26.328 --> 29:29.999
- Bridge.
- Captain's on the Bridge.

29:30.083 --> 29:35.796
Captain, C.I.C. reports a surface contact
bearing 350 at 130 miles.

29:37.090 --> 29:39.925
- I want an I.D. on the surface contact.
- Yes, sir.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.179
- Launch the ready alert.
- Aye, sir.

30:16.925 --> 30:20.012
Which, translated
into world terms

30:20.096 --> 30:24.934
means a worldwide reduction
of armaments

30:25.060 --> 30:30.440
to such a point
and in such a thorough fashion

30:30.440 --> 30:34.069
that no nation
will be in a position

30:34.153 --> 30:36.696
to commit an act
of physical aggression

30:36.780 --> 30:40.410
against any neighbor anywhere

30:40.493 --> 30:42.745
in the world.

30:42.870 --> 30:44.539
What the hell's the matter with him?

30:44.622 --> 30:47.250
He's asking us to trust our enemies,
and he knows better.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.835
You're absolutely right.

30:58.597 --> 31:00.849
Hey, Laurel,
you finished that very quickly.

31:00.933 --> 31:06.690
Well, I hope so. Let's see,
where were we? Uhh...

31:06.731 --> 31:10.319
"And there"... Oops.
"And therefore"... Ah, here we are.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.696
"So if he does choose
to support my program

31:12.821 --> 31:15.074
let Senator Chapman
be assured now

31:15.157 --> 31:17.742
that I am fully aware
of those qualities in him

31:17.826 --> 31:20.871
which recommend him
as cabinet material."

31:20.955 --> 31:24.250
I think that says it exactly.
You agree, Arthur?

31:24.334 --> 31:28.129
- Miss Scott, you should've been a diplomat.
- I rather thought I was.

31:28.213 --> 31:31.257
Well, you certainly cooked up
a compromise that's gonna make your boss

31:31.341 --> 31:33.844
the next vice president
of the United States.

31:33.927 --> 31:37.098
I better type this up before you two start
trying to improve on it.

31:37.181 --> 31:39.683
- Thanks, Laurel.
- Here in downtown Honolulu

31:39.766 --> 31:43.104
the weather is 78
under partly cloudy skies.

31:43.187 --> 31:46.774
Arthur, will you leave the girl
enough clothes on not to catch cold?

31:46.858 --> 31:48.152
She's too valuable to me.

31:48.236 --> 31:49.821
Have you slept with her yet?

31:49.863 --> 31:53.158
What kind of a question is
that to ask a married man?

31:53.242 --> 31:56.245
- You son of a gun!
- Think I better go check what she's doin'.

31:56.370 --> 31:59.331
- Oh, sure!
- Arthur, have another drink

31:59.456 --> 32:01.667
and stop thinking about how
much everybody else is gettin'.

32:01.751 --> 32:05.171
- Thanks!
- See you later.

32:08.758 --> 32:12.762
We swung it, Laurel. How about that?
We really swung it!

32:12.887 --> 32:16.475
- Did you tell him you were sleeping with me?
- What?

32:16.558 --> 32:19.311
Laurel. I wish I was.

32:19.395 --> 32:22.398
- I'm not gonna lie about it.
- People assume you are anyway.

32:22.481 --> 32:26.402
- I'll just have to live with the fact.
- Fact?

32:26.402 --> 32:28.904
Of what they think.

32:28.987 --> 32:31.283
You're a strange girl,
Laurel.

32:31.408 --> 32:35.538
You give more back talk and less
cooperation than any girl on Capitol Hill.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.081
I don't know why I put up with
you and your dog.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.083
I don't know why
I just don't fire you.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.378
Because I'm the best
political assistant you'll find

32:42.503 --> 32:44.798
and you're still more interested
in politics than sex.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.843
Charlie!

32:47.927 --> 32:50.137
What is he barking at?

32:53.140 --> 32:55.518
Charlie, what is it?

32:57.938 --> 33:00.732
Listen.

33:21.964 --> 33:24.300
They had U.S. markings.

33:24.383 --> 33:27.011
- You sure of that?
- I thought so too.

33:27.095 --> 33:29.556
Their speed!
Are they ours?

33:29.639 --> 33:33.727
I don't know. But if they are ours,
they've kept them a close secret.

33:35.562 --> 33:39.358
- I want inquiries made as soon as we return.
- Yes, Senator.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.537
Bridge.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.001
Skipper, the F-14s
are on top of the contact.

33:56.794 --> 33:59.046
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

33:59.130 --> 34:01.633
We've overflown
the craft, sir.

34:01.716 --> 34:04.844
It's a civilian yacht,
flying U.S. flag

34:04.927 --> 34:07.639
about 50 feet in length,
old but in mint condition.

34:07.722 --> 34:11.353
- Over.
- Hold observation position.

34:11.436 --> 34:13.980
Dispatching 86 tanker
for refueling.

34:23.533 --> 34:25.826
Stand clear, Path 1.

34:25.909 --> 34:27.995
86 tanker departing.

34:33.833 --> 34:37.213
The challenger's back with one,
two, threejabs to the mouth.

34:37.339 --> 34:40.842
Louis responds with a right to the head.
Cuts with a left to the body.

34:40.926 --> 34:43.554
- Brings it up to the head.
- Hey, who's that fighting?

34:43.638 --> 34:46.724
- Louis takes another left and a right.
- I don't know.

34:46.849 --> 34:50.728
Louis is staggered by a right to thejaw.
He almost goes down.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.315
There's the bell ending round 12.

34:53.399 --> 34:56.068
Look sharp, feel sharp

34:56.150 --> 34:59.197
Be sharp and listen, mister
How are you fixed for blades

34:59.280 --> 35:02.534
- Do you have plenty?
- How are you fixed for blades

35:02.576 --> 35:04.035
You're better off...

35:04.077 --> 35:05.580
Let's get some air.

35:07.748 --> 35:09.834
Captain's off the Bridge.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.254
I don't know.

35:16.256 --> 35:20.053
Dan, what's this all about?
What do you make of it?

35:20.178 --> 35:23.014
Nostalgia broadcasting
on the Armed Forces band.

35:23.098 --> 35:26.184
Broadcasting
after a strike? Nah.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.687
Excuse me.

35:31.022 --> 35:34.986
Sir, is it possible that this could be
part of some secret naval maneuver?

35:35.027 --> 35:37.530
- Course not.
- There are a few people

35:37.614 --> 35:41.994
- who'd like to watch us work under pressure.
- What are you saying, Dan?

35:42.035 --> 35:44.121
The Department of Defense sent
him out here.

35:44.204 --> 35:46.541
Maybe they wanted
to give him something to watch.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.128
Now, that makes more sense
than anything else so far.

35:49.211 --> 35:53.340
Now, wait a minute, gentlemen. You may
be the victims of some kind of joke.

35:53.424 --> 35:55.009
But whether the Pentagon's
behind it

35:55.134 --> 35:57.428
or the Kremlin
or some little green men from Mars

35:57.512 --> 36:00.264
I promise you, I'm as much
in the dark about it as you are.

36:00.305 --> 36:03.059
Captain, we're getting something
you might wanna hear.

36:03.143 --> 36:04.811
- In the Plot Room.
- Aye, sir.

36:13.945 --> 36:18.451
The Germans are retreating
on the 70-mile front in southern Russia.

36:18.535 --> 36:23.122
However, forces were reported
200 miles from Moscow

36:23.247 --> 36:27.043
and long-range artillery fire
was heard in the suburbs of Moscow.

36:27.168 --> 36:31.214
- Meanwhile in Washington...
- What the hell's going on here?

36:31.298 --> 36:32.466
Sir, I think you ought to see

36:32.550 --> 36:34.802
these aerial reconnaissance
photographs of Pearl Harbor.

36:34.885 --> 36:36.971
- Turn that off!
- Yes, sir.

36:37.055 --> 36:39.140
That'll be all.
You.

36:48.569 --> 36:52.155
- It's not Pearl Harbor.
- Sure as hell is.

36:52.280 --> 36:55.366
Look at that old battle rig.

36:55.492 --> 37:00.164
It's a memorial now.
It's the Arizona.

37:02.875 --> 37:06.003
- But she's completely intact.
- That's right.

37:07.004 --> 37:10.091
- Get Mr. Lasky back up here.
- Yes, sir.

37:14.597 --> 37:16.807
What's the matter
with you?

37:16.890 --> 37:21.353
I was just on the Bridge.
They're scared. Real scared.

37:21.436 --> 37:25.400
- What happened?
- It's crazy.

37:25.526 --> 37:29.113
The Russians, us,
even the Germans.

37:29.238 --> 37:32.074
- We've finally done it.
- Done what, for Christ's sake?

37:32.116 --> 37:37.538
- War. We're at war.
- You always talkin' shit.

37:44.255 --> 37:45.465
I want a straight answer

37:45.548 --> 37:48.843
and I don't give a damn about any orders
you've had elsewhere.

37:48.926 --> 37:50.928
Is there something
you've held back?

37:51.053 --> 37:53.516
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing, Captain.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.437
All right.
I accept that.

37:59.563 --> 38:04.359
Here's a photo taken by our reconnaissance
pilots less than an hour ago.

38:07.989 --> 38:11.785
- May I suggest something, Captain?
- I'm wide open.

38:11.868 --> 38:15.039
I suggest that you ask Commander Owens
to come up here right away

38:15.122 --> 38:17.500
and bring the photos he's using
to illustrate his book.

38:17.583 --> 38:18.959
Why?

38:19.001 --> 38:22.506
I think he'll have something
very interesting to show you.

38:22.589 --> 38:23.757
All right.

38:30.931 --> 38:35.895
Tanker, this is Alert 1. You got
two thirsty Tomcats. Whaddya got?

38:35.978 --> 38:38.524
I've got the hard stuff.
Pull right in.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.204
Contact.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.581
We've got a green light.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.750
Fill 'er up, check the oil
and clean the windshield. Over.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.135
Dick, where'd you get these?

39:04.219 --> 39:08.306
I got them from the Smithsonian, sir.
They're old agency photos of Pearl.

39:08.348 --> 39:11.351
- Just like these.
- Not like these.

39:11.434 --> 39:14.145
That one was taken
less than an hour ago.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.442
I don't understand, sir.
These are pre-World War II pictures.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.653
This is the fleet
that was destroyed.

39:20.737 --> 39:25.575
Sir, C.I.C. reports two bogeys
at low altitude. Distance, 125 miles.

39:25.658 --> 39:29.036
- Have our fighters take an I.D. pass.
- Aye, Captain.

39:33.208 --> 39:37.922
Have our fighters investigate and
identify the contact 090, signal Buster.

39:38.006 --> 39:40.800
Aye, sir. Alert 1,
this is Eagle Control.

39:40.884 --> 39:44.512
Vector 210 for the bogeys.
Bogeys low and slow.

39:44.596 --> 39:47.933
Your signal is Buster.
I say again, your signal is Buster.

39:48.017 --> 39:51.521
Roger, Eagle Control.
Alert 2 now completing its fueling.

39:51.605 --> 39:53.940
Vectoring 210. Out.

39:59.822 --> 40:03.284
That's the Arizona,
Tennessee, West Virginia.

40:03.325 --> 40:05.828
You're saying

40:05.912 --> 40:08.706
that these are both photographs
of Pearl Harbor

40:08.790 --> 40:11.542
on December 6, 1941?

40:16.715 --> 40:18.801
Yes, sir.

40:18.926 --> 40:20.886
Our reconnaissance plane
has just taken pictures

40:20.928 --> 40:23.681
of something
that hasn't existed

40:23.764 --> 40:26.474
for over 40 years.

40:26.558 --> 40:29.813
Sir, we've got I.D.
on the bogeys.

40:32.356 --> 40:34.401
- Captain's on the Bridge.
- What button?

40:34.526 --> 40:36.486
Eleven, sir.

40:38.030 --> 40:41.201
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

40:41.284 --> 40:44.455
- Two Japanese Zeros, sir.
- Two what?

40:44.538 --> 40:49.085
Two trophy-class Mitsubishi
A6Ms in original condition

40:49.126 --> 40:51.212
complete with all markings.

40:51.295 --> 40:54.173
- I mean, they look brand new, sir.
- Have you been spotted?

40:54.256 --> 40:57.219
Negative. We're right
on the side at 6:00 high.

40:57.302 --> 41:00.180
Stay in visual contact.
Take no action without clearance.

41:00.263 --> 41:02.850
Wilco, Eagle 1. Out.

41:05.352 --> 41:08.563
- Jack Benny and Rochester.
- And newscasts from World War II.

41:08.646 --> 41:11.317
Somebody
for some reason

41:11.400 --> 41:13.862
wants us to believe
that we're back in 1941.

41:13.987 --> 41:15.947
- Now, who wants it?
- The Russians.

41:16.072 --> 41:18.116
- Oh, Dan.
- Maybe. Power of psychology.

41:18.199 --> 41:20.243
Excuse me, Captain

41:20.326 --> 41:22.954
but we also have to consider
one alternative possibility.

41:22.996 --> 41:24.498
What's that?

41:24.581 --> 41:27.502
The possibility that what's
happening here is real.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.170
Geez, that's ridiculous.

41:29.295 --> 41:32.674
Maybe, but we have some
pretty strong evidence, sir.

41:32.717 --> 41:35.427
Let's not just write off one
possible explanation for it

41:35.511 --> 41:38.891
- because we don't happen to like it.
- How would that be possible?

41:39.016 --> 41:41.393
- Could you explain that to me?
- No, sir, I can't.

41:41.434 --> 41:43.937
But all of us know that movement
through time is possible.

41:44.021 --> 41:45.563
Einstein proved it.

41:45.647 --> 41:47.816
- In theory.
- In theory.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.610
So all we have to do is move
through some storm at sea, and bingo...

41:50.693 --> 41:52.989
we're all much more
clever than Einstein.

41:53.031 --> 41:56.700
What sort of storm was that, Commander?
Certainly nothing like I've ever seen.

41:56.826 --> 41:59.996
Nothing like any of us
have ever seen.

42:00.038 --> 42:01.247
There are forces in the universe

42:01.330 --> 42:03.166
which we're only now just
beginning to understand.

42:03.249 --> 42:05.794
I mean, understand through science,
not superstition.

42:05.877 --> 42:08.881
There are black holes in space,
antimatter, curved space...

42:08.964 --> 42:10.340
things that are as strange to us

42:10.424 --> 42:13.052
as electricity would have been
to people in the Middle Ages

42:13.135 --> 42:17.098
or this ship
in World War II.

42:19.725 --> 42:23.898
Well, crew is anxious
for an explanation too.

42:25.566 --> 42:29.195
Now, we've gotta get
a clearer picture of all this.

42:30.572 --> 42:32.615
Let's go to C.I.C.

42:47.882 --> 42:50.177
Hey.

42:50.260 --> 42:52.930
- What is it?
- Listen.

43:00.395 --> 43:02.523
It's those planes again.

43:02.607 --> 43:06.653
No, no.
Different noise entirely.

43:06.737 --> 43:08.823
There they are.

43:29.803 --> 43:32.724
- They're not ours, are they?
- No, certainly not.

43:32.807 --> 43:35.102
They have Japanese markings.

43:47.823 --> 43:49.951
They're comin' in again.

43:52.745 --> 43:57.209
Laurel, ask the captain
to radio Hawaii.

43:57.293 --> 44:00.338
Find out about Japanese
fighter planes in the area.

44:00.463 --> 44:02.507
Yes, Senator.

44:12.977 --> 44:15.563
Oh, God! They're shooting!

44:22.570 --> 44:25.656
Oh, my God.

44:27.785 --> 44:30.538
- Oh, no.
- The captain send the message?

44:33.583 --> 44:36.252
We've gotta
get off this boat.

44:36.336 --> 44:38.421
Come on, Laurel!

44:40.841 --> 44:43.303
Eagle Control,
this is Alert 1.

44:43.386 --> 44:46.139
Theyjust strafed the hell
out of that yacht!

44:46.223 --> 44:47.933
Why would they
attack a yacht?

44:48.725 --> 44:52.354
Their job would be to destroy anything
with a radio that could warn Pearl Harbor.

44:52.437 --> 44:55.900
Providing you
and Mr. Einstein are correct.

44:55.942 --> 45:01.948
Dick, where would the Japanese fleet be
at this time on December 6, 1941?

45:02.031 --> 45:03.908
Well, sir, they'd be off the scope

45:04.033 --> 45:06.619
but an educated guess
would be around about here.

45:06.744 --> 45:10.249
Excuse me. They'd have to be here,
up around the northwest sector.

45:10.332 --> 45:13.252
Let's get this settled once and for all.
Have the E-2 check it out.

45:13.335 --> 45:15.837
I wanna see if the Japanese
task force is out there.

45:15.921 --> 45:16.964
Yes, sir.

45:17.047 --> 45:20.592
Eagle Control, Alert 1.
They're making another run.

45:20.675 --> 45:23.471
Jesus! They'll shoot that
damn yacht to pieces!

45:23.554 --> 45:25.599
Request permission
to arm and fire.

45:25.682 --> 45:27.935
- For God sakes, Skipper...
- Negative.

45:29.478 --> 45:31.731
- Charlie? Charlie!
- No, Laurel! Not now!

45:31.773 --> 45:34.651
Come on! Those planes are coming in!
Come on!

45:34.776 --> 45:37.696
Let's go! Come on, Harvey!

45:52.796 --> 45:57.176
Eagle Control, they blew it to bits.
They must've hit the fuel tank!

45:57.301 --> 46:00.720
- Any survivors?
- Stand by.

46:00.804 --> 46:04.933
Affiirmative.
One, two, three Mae Wests!

46:05.017 --> 46:07.478
Hey, wait a minute!
Those bastards are turning back!

46:07.520 --> 46:10.273
They're gonna strafe them in the water!
Request permission to fire.

46:10.315 --> 46:13.985
This is Eagle 1. You are cleared to arm,
but do not fire.

46:14.110 --> 46:16.946
Throw them off,
play with them, but don't fire.

46:16.988 --> 46:19.033
Affirmative.

46:22.495 --> 46:26.500
- Sam! Sam.
- All right. It's all right. I'm all right.

46:28.336 --> 46:29.462
Look up!

46:29.503 --> 46:32.298
Oh, no!
They're coming again!

46:36.220 --> 46:39.348
Harvey! Get that life preserver off
and dive!

46:39.431 --> 46:41.558
I can't swim!

46:41.641 --> 46:44.186
Here they come!

47:01.371 --> 47:02.498
He's dead.

47:10.507 --> 47:14.636
It's okay. Easy, boy.
Up you go.

47:26.191 --> 47:29.695
Hey, Fox, that woke 'em up!

47:29.779 --> 47:32.448
I think we should
give 'em another shot.

49:14.519 --> 49:17.272
Why the hell are we
playing with these guys?

49:20.025 --> 49:22.654
Radar shows enemy planes
heading on course, 220.

49:22.737 --> 49:25.782
- 220.
- Sweet Jesus.

49:25.865 --> 49:28.243
Skipper, they're headed
straight for us

49:28.326 --> 49:31.704
and we've got an armed strike force
just sitting on the deck.

49:34.917 --> 49:38.505
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
You're cleared to fire.

49:38.630 --> 49:42.551
Splash the Zeros.
I say again, splash the Zeros.

49:42.634 --> 49:46.971
- Yes, sir.
- This has gotta be a dream.

50:49.250 --> 50:51.835
Eagle Control, Alert 1.

50:51.918 --> 50:54.505
Splash two. Repeat.

50:54.630 --> 50:56.673
Splash two.

50:56.757 --> 50:59.635
Possibly one survivor
in the water.

50:59.718 --> 51:02.472
Captain, the E-2
is coming upon Point Charlie.

51:03.931 --> 51:06.017
Eagle Control, we have
multiple radar contacts

51:06.142 --> 51:08.936
picking up on 456 heading.

51:09.020 --> 51:12.691
Possible carriers
and 24 escort ships.

51:12.775 --> 51:14.778
Southeasterly heading.

51:14.861 --> 51:17.114
Negative radio
or radar emissions.

51:17.239 --> 51:19.784
Request instructions.
Over.

51:19.867 --> 51:21.869
That is the Japanese
attack force.

51:21.952 --> 51:25.748
Yeah. I guess
now we know.

51:25.831 --> 51:30.253
Look, Dick. Take personal charge
of a rescue team

51:30.337 --> 51:32.881
and keep the survivors
isolated.

51:32.964 --> 51:34.966
- Crazy situation.
- Yes, sir.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.927
- You know what I want.
- I understand.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.845
Keep the fighters airborne
to cover the rescue.

51:38.970 --> 51:39.638
Aye, aye, Skipper.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.225
Now track and report all movements
of the Japanese task force.

51:43.310 --> 51:45.269
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Do you still think it's a dream?

51:45.353 --> 51:47.855
It's a nightmare.

53:08.069 --> 53:10.531
Let go!
Forget the damn dog!

53:51.452 --> 53:53.745
- Boss, 36.
- Go ahead, 36.

53:53.829 --> 53:56.748
We got two survivors
and now we're waiting to pick up Kag.

53:56.832 --> 54:00.836
- Kag? What the hell is he doing in the water?
- Damned if I know.

54:12.725 --> 54:14.477
Charlie!

54:21.485 --> 54:24.153
You all right,
ma'am?

54:26.448 --> 54:28.450
How you feeling, sir?

54:28.534 --> 54:32.122
What the hell kind of machine is this thing?
And what's your ship, Commander?

54:32.205 --> 54:35.501
It's an aircraft carrier, sir.
I'm Air Wing Commander Richard Owens.

54:35.542 --> 54:39.295
- Sam Chapman.
- Senator Samuel Chapman?

54:39.379 --> 54:41.507
That's right.

54:41.548 --> 54:43.842
Sure am glad
you were out here.

54:47.471 --> 54:49.807
Yes, sir.

55:24.012 --> 55:26.723
Okay, Senator,
watch yourself.

55:26.807 --> 55:28.851
Watch your head.

55:30.102 --> 55:32.438
- All right, take it easy.
- Hang on to me, sir.

55:32.521 --> 55:34.941
You'll be just fine.

55:40.112 --> 55:42.115
It's all right, ma'am.
Go with him.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.284
I'll take the dog,
Commander.

56:16.904 --> 56:19.198
Little bastard.

56:40.013 --> 56:42.015
Corporal!

56:51.400 --> 56:54.362
Mind the store, Ray.
I'm going forward.

56:59.034 --> 57:03.955
- Holy cow.
- It's the whole Japanese fleet.

57:17.262 --> 57:21.810
Have these things returned
to the Japanese pilot. Get this translated.

57:25.772 --> 57:27.523
Captain's on the Bridge.

57:36.742 --> 57:39.662
Mr. Lasky.
Gentlemen.

57:39.704 --> 57:42.165
Captain's off the Bridge.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.804
We can't ignore it
any longer.

57:54.887 --> 57:57.348
Every man on this ship knows
that we have radar and visual contact

57:57.473 --> 57:59.934
with a Japanese fleet
approaching Pearl Harbor

58:00.017 --> 58:03.646
on December 6, 1941.

58:03.731 --> 58:06.192
- Now, what do we do about it?
- Skipper,

58:06.275 --> 58:09.779
what we do about it
is blow them out of the water.

58:09.904 --> 58:13.074
The U.S.S. Nimitz declares war
on the Japanese empire?

58:13.199 --> 58:16.871
That's what we'd be doing. But they haven't
attacked Pearl Harbor yet.

58:16.954 --> 58:20.750
The only evidence we have that
they intend to is in the history books.

58:20.791 --> 58:24.712
It opens up some
amazing possibilities.

58:24.795 --> 58:28.842
Think of the firepower
of the U.S.S. Nimitz back in 1941.

58:28.925 --> 58:31.387
What kind of possibilities,
Mr. Lasky?

58:31.470 --> 58:34.265
Possibilities for the future,
Mr. Owens.

58:34.348 --> 58:36.976
Think of the history
of the next 40 years.

58:38.728 --> 58:41.355
I have a suspicion history will be a little
more difficult to beat

58:41.438 --> 58:43.607
than you imagine,
Mr. Lasky.

58:43.649 --> 58:46.779
I'm talking about
the classic paradox of time.

58:46.820 --> 58:50.032
Imagine, for example, I go back in time
to meet my own grandfather

58:50.157 --> 58:52.617
long before he got married,
before he had children.

58:52.659 --> 58:54.661
We have an argument,
and I kill him.

58:54.745 --> 58:58.540
Now, if that happens,
how am I ever gonna be born?

58:58.665 --> 59:01.127
And if I can never be born,
how can I go back in history

59:01.169 --> 59:04.339
and meet
my very own grandfather?

59:04.464 --> 59:07.634
I'm not half the theorist
you are, Mr. Lasky

59:07.760 --> 59:10.720
but I still have a gut instinct
that things only happen once.

59:10.805 --> 59:13.809
And if they have happened, then there's
nothing we can do to change them

59:13.892 --> 59:16.727
- nor should we try.
- How are you gonna avoid it?

59:16.812 --> 59:19.606
It's already happening,
and we're already involved.

59:19.690 --> 59:23.652
For Christ's sake, what is this?
Some half-ass Princeton debating society?

59:23.778 --> 59:26.238
We are in a war situation.

59:26.322 --> 59:28.325
This is a United States
warship

59:28.408 --> 59:30.535
or at least
it used to be.

59:30.618 --> 59:33.663
Or will be.
Or what the hell ever.

59:33.789 --> 59:35.999
Oh, goddamn it, you can
drive yourself crazy

59:36.083 --> 59:37.667
trying to think about this stuff.

59:37.793 --> 59:40.503
- Jesus, I must be dreaming!
- Now, hold it.

59:40.587 --> 59:43.674
All right.
Let's all calm down.

59:43.800 --> 59:48.221
Let's take it one step at a time
and by the book.

59:48.304 --> 59:51.682
If the United States of America
falls under attack

59:51.724 --> 59:54.393
our job is to defend her

59:54.518 --> 59:56.856
in the past, present
or future.

59:56.897 --> 59:59.900
- And after that?
- After that, we take our orders

59:59.942 --> 01:00:02.904
from the commander in chief
of the United States Armed Forces.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.368
Franklin Delano Roosevelt?

01:00:26.264 --> 01:00:28.391
- Everything all right here?
- You in command of this ship?

01:00:28.432 --> 01:00:31.895
Oh, hardly. No, I'm a doctor.
Ship's commander is Captain Yelland.

01:00:31.978 --> 01:00:34.063
I'm sure he'll be down to see you
as soon as possible.

01:00:34.147 --> 01:00:36.732
- I certainly hope so.
- Meanwhile, you both seem

01:00:36.774 --> 01:00:39.486
- none the worse for your little mishap.
- Mishap?

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.530
You call getting a boat shot out
from under you

01:00:41.613 --> 01:00:44.074
and three people dead a mishap?

01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:46.826
- Are we at war? Is that what happened?
- I'm not in a position to...

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.587
Am I glad to see you.

01:00:57.173 --> 01:00:59.676
Doctor

01:00:59.717 --> 01:01:02.429
would you please inform the captain
that Senator Samuel Chapman

01:01:02.512 --> 01:01:04.431
cochairman of the Senate
Defense Committee

01:01:04.472 --> 01:01:05.808
would like to see him at once?

01:01:05.892 --> 01:01:08.311
Of course, Senator.

01:01:09.812 --> 01:01:11.898
Doctor, I believe
I said at once.

01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:15.568
First, a vitamin shot.
Now, if you'll both roll up your sleeves.

01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:18.321
- Senator.
- No, goddamn it!

01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:20.657
Now, you can take up
your needles, Doctor

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.036
and whatever's in them
and get the hell out of here!

01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:28.707
Corporal?

01:01:38.134 --> 01:01:41.221
What the hell
are we, prisoners?

01:02:37.075 --> 01:02:40.203
Holy shit.

01:02:47.128 --> 01:02:50.256
Smoking lamp is lighted
in all authorized spaces.

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.191
Son of a...

01:03:07.608 --> 01:03:10.028
So, history may be tougher
to beat than I imagined.

01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.739
You're becoming
a real pain in the ass, Lasky.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:15.492
You take an awful lot of risks for someone
who's supposed to be intelligent.

01:03:15.576 --> 01:03:20.372
Do I? "The attack on Pearl Harbor
was far from a surprise for many people

01:03:20.457 --> 01:03:24.044
among them, the prominent
and ambitious Samuel S. Chapman

01:03:24.127 --> 01:03:25.462
who had only two weeks before

01:03:25.545 --> 01:03:28.549
publicly argued for an increase
in our strength in the Pacific.

01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:31.219
Ironically, the senator disappeared
and was presumed dead

01:03:31.302 --> 01:03:33.762
following the attack
he had foreseen so clearly.

01:03:33.846 --> 01:03:36.265
Had he lived,
it's very possible

01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:40.770
Chapman could have been Roosevelt's
running mate in the 1944 election

01:03:40.812 --> 01:03:44.983
and upon his death, the next
president of the United States."

01:03:45.067 --> 01:03:47.777
Now if that doesn't come under
the heading of trying to beat history

01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:48.737
I don't know what does.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.156
Lasky, I realized who we had
the moment I heard his name.

01:03:51.281 --> 01:03:52.449
Why'd you keep it to yourself?

01:03:52.491 --> 01:03:54.828
I don't have your appetite
for playing God with the world.

01:03:54.911 --> 01:03:57.581
What was I supposed to do,
throw him back in the sea?

01:03:57.664 --> 01:03:58.957
At least that would have
preserved

01:03:58.999 --> 01:04:01.001
the natural order
of history as you've written it.

01:04:01.085 --> 01:04:03.045
Go to hell, Lasky.

01:04:03.129 --> 01:04:05.631
Go to hell yourself.
I wanna meet Chapman.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.721
Goddamn it.

01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:12.931
If this wasn't happening to me,
I wouldn't believe it.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:16.310
- Who the hell are these people?
- The navy.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:19.647
Yeah, the navy, yeah.
But what part of it?

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:22.359
I've never seen machines
like they got onboard this thing.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.154
And where have they been
developing aircraft like that?

01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:28.407
The navy would have to
appear before my committee

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:31.493
and I've never even heard
a whisper about it.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:35.664
Rocket planes and that thing
they pulled us out of the sea with.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:39.502
And naming this ship after Chester Nimitz,
an active-duty admiral.

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:41.587
What the hell's
going on here?

01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:45.966
Yeah, Roosevelt.
He owns the military.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.303
That's it.

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:50.138
That's exactly who.

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:53.143
F.D.R. has wanted the United States
in this war since it started

01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:54.894
but he knows there's no way
it's gonna happen

01:04:54.977 --> 01:04:56.188
except in response to an attack.

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:59.400
- You always said the Japanese would attack.
- That's right.

01:04:59.483 --> 01:05:01.694
And who's sitting out here
with no press

01:05:01.777 --> 01:05:04.238
while the White House takes
all the credit for raising the alarm

01:05:04.363 --> 01:05:07.075
and being ready
to hit back?

01:05:07.159 --> 01:05:10.412
- Obviously, we are.
- Goddamn it!

01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:26.637
Anything?

01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:28.389
Whoever he is,
he's either too scared

01:05:28.473 --> 01:05:30.141
or too well briefed
to talk about it.

01:05:31.892 --> 01:05:34.313
Excuse me.

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:40.110
All right, Corporal.

01:05:40.194 --> 01:05:44.406
Commander, I demand to know
why we're being held prisoners.

01:05:45.199 --> 01:05:46.827
Here wait. I got him.

01:05:55.295 --> 01:05:57.839
Jesus Christ!

01:05:57.922 --> 01:06:00.634
No, don't!

01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:03.971
Oh, my God.

01:06:44.182 --> 01:06:46.435
The prisoner has shot one,
maybe two of your men.

01:06:46.518 --> 01:06:48.478
Move in!

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:56.779
Captain, prisoner
grabbed a weapon.

01:06:56.862 --> 01:06:59.866
He shot one of my men,
maybe two.

01:06:59.908 --> 01:07:02.494
We're in position.
The area is sealed off.

01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:04.746
Stand by.

01:07:06.498 --> 01:07:08.959
Get Lieutenant Kajima
up here on the double.

01:07:11.338 --> 01:07:13.840
Can't we get a translator
down here, for God's sakes?

01:07:13.923 --> 01:07:17.093
How the hell do we know what he's saying
if we can't understand him?

01:07:17.218 --> 01:07:19.596
We need a translator to tell him
we need a translator.

01:07:22.098 --> 01:07:24.685
Maybe that's just what
he's trying to tell us.

01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:52.341
All right, Dick, Lieutenant Kajima is here.
Put it on the box.

01:08:01.476 --> 01:08:03.478
Ask him what he wants.

01:08:16.451 --> 01:08:19.078
He wants access
to a radio, sir.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:20.872
Does he say why?

01:08:20.955 --> 01:08:24.377
Because he wants to
warn his commander

01:08:24.419 --> 01:08:26.879
about us.

01:08:38.892 --> 01:08:41.395
He repeats the demand.

01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:44.898
- Or else?
- He will kill again.

01:08:47.652 --> 01:08:49.153
Do you think there's a chance
they might believe him?

01:08:50.613 --> 01:08:54.743
There's no chance if things remain
the way they are.

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:02.877
Tell him we agree.

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:46.801
- You son of a...
- No! Don't shoot! Back off!

01:09:46.885 --> 01:09:48.970
Don't shoot!

01:09:49.053 --> 01:09:51.557
Back off! Back off!
Don't shoot!

01:09:51.682 --> 01:09:54.519
What the hell's
going on down there?

01:10:04.405 --> 01:10:07.949
He says one more attempt to trick him
and the girl is dead.

01:10:08.033 --> 01:10:12.203
There'll be no tricks. He can use
the radio room if he frees the girl.

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:27.094
Says he doesn't believe you.

01:10:29.097 --> 01:10:31.642
Why don't you tell him
what's going on here, Commander?

01:10:31.725 --> 01:10:34.144
You're an expert on what's
gonna happen tomorrow

01:10:34.227 --> 01:10:35.938
tell him about it,
for God's sakes.

01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:38.858
Go on, tell him!
We got nothing to lose!

01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:43.865
Go ahead, tell him.

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:50.581
26 November, six carriers
left the Coral Isles north of Japan.

01:10:59.466 --> 01:11:03.427
The carriers were
the Akagi, Kaga, Shokaku

01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:06.055
Zuikaku, Hiryu, Soryu.

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:10.936
Tomorrow at dawn,
these carriers will send 353 planes

01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:13.814
to attack Pearl Harbor.

01:11:13.897 --> 01:11:16.609
How in the hell
do you know all that?

01:11:21.489 --> 01:11:25.869
Your code is
"Climb Mount Niitaka."

01:12:18.218 --> 01:12:20.556
What's going on?

01:12:23.934 --> 01:12:27.187
Please, Miss Scott,
don't ask me any questions.

01:12:27.228 --> 01:12:30.148
There isn't anything
I can tell you at this time.

01:12:42.871 --> 01:12:44.832
All right?

01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:50.755
Where's Charlie?
Where's my dog?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.258
We'll find him,
Miss Scott.

01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:56.595
He can't get off
the ship.

01:12:59.388 --> 01:13:04.688
Casualties will be moved
down to secondary triage.

01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:08.441
I wanna get out of this bathrobe
and into some clothes!

01:13:08.524 --> 01:13:10.861
Will somebody please get me
some clothes? For God's sakes!

01:13:10.944 --> 01:13:14.948
- Chief, get the senator some clothes.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:17.994
Senator, Matt Yelland,
commanding officer.

01:13:18.119 --> 01:13:22.832
Where and how did you get
all this information I've been hearing?

01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:25.459
- And is it true?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:28.379
Did you inform
Pearl Harbor Command?

01:13:28.462 --> 01:13:31.091
- No, Senator.
- Why the hell not?

01:13:34.469 --> 01:13:37.765
Well, the reasons are a little complicated,
but, uh, believe me, Senator

01:13:37.806 --> 01:13:41.352
this carrier is capable of handling
any attack should it occur.

01:13:41.435 --> 01:13:43.437
One carrier
against a whole fleet?

01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:45.524
What kind of an idiot
do you take me for?

01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:47.818
- Senator, calm down.
- The hell with you.

01:13:47.943 --> 01:13:50.863
Tell Pearl Harbor what's happening here,
or I'll talk to them.

01:13:50.946 --> 01:13:53.283
Very well.

01:13:53.366 --> 01:13:56.745
Dan, set up the communications
in my inport cabin.

01:13:58.747 --> 01:14:02.001
Wouldn't you like to talk to them
with some clothes on?

01:14:04.545 --> 01:14:08.215
- Thank you, Captain.
- Follow me, sir.

01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:18.310
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir, I'm fine.

01:14:18.351 --> 01:14:20.896
Can you do that, Captain?

01:14:20.979 --> 01:14:24.900
Contact Pearl Harbor
back in 1941.

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:28.654
I think so.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.491
- Then what do you do?
- One step at a time.

01:14:32.575 --> 01:14:36.245
Yeah. Like a minefield.

01:14:52.431 --> 01:14:57.562
This is, uh, Senator Samuel S. Chapman
of the United States Senate

01:14:57.645 --> 01:15:00.648
onboard
the aircraft carrier Nimitz.

01:15:00.733 --> 01:15:03.235
Captain Yelland
is here with me.

01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:05.528
- You're on what?
- I repeat.

01:15:05.612 --> 01:15:09.617
I am Senator Samuel S. Chapman
onboard the U.S.S. Nimitz.

01:15:09.743 --> 01:15:12.036
All right,
whoever the hell you are

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.249
use of military frequencies
by unauthorized personnel is a felony.

01:15:16.332 --> 01:15:18.542
Now just a minute here, sir.

01:15:18.626 --> 01:15:22.380
As we have no aircraft carrier Nimitz
and no Captain Yelland

01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:26.718
I suggest, asshole, that you stop
impersonating some other asshole

01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:28.053
and get off the air.

01:15:28.137 --> 01:15:30.181
You're wasting our time.

01:15:30.265 --> 01:15:33.684
How dare you talk to me that way!
Captain, tell him who you are.

01:15:33.769 --> 01:15:35.229
Speak to them!

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:43.280
You, what are you doing here?
You're a civilian.

01:15:43.363 --> 01:15:45.282
Yes, sir, I'm with
the Department of Def...

01:15:45.365 --> 01:15:46.867
I mean, the Navy Department.

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.036
That's more like it.
What's going on here?

01:15:49.119 --> 01:15:51.748
I'm afraid I'm just
an observer here, sir.

01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.083
I couldn't tell you anything more
than you already know.

01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:58.337
What's happening here?

01:16:00.173 --> 01:16:02.842
Who are you people?

01:16:12.144 --> 01:16:14.521
- join him in his inport cabin.
- Thank you.

01:16:19.235 --> 01:16:21.530
I'll wait outside
while you change.

01:16:21.613 --> 01:16:26.786
Please, I really don't want to
be left alone right now.

01:16:26.828 --> 01:16:29.371
I'll just be a minute.

01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:38.299
Just exactly what is it you do
for the senator, Miss Scott?

01:16:38.424 --> 01:16:41.970
I work for him, Commander.

01:16:42.053 --> 01:16:44.848
I'd like to think I'm more
than just a secretary.

01:16:44.931 --> 01:16:49.269
I write most of his speeches,
and in general, I'm his assistant.

01:16:49.353 --> 01:16:51.939
It's quite an accomplishment
for a woman in your day...

01:16:52.022 --> 01:16:53.232
this day and age.

01:16:53.357 --> 01:16:57.319
Let me tell you something.
I'm ambitious and very capable.

01:16:57.444 --> 01:17:00.655
That's a combination
that's not much appreciated.

01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:03.493
It's a man's world.
I'm sure you'll agree.

01:17:05.661 --> 01:17:07.748
It certainly is, Miss Scott.

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:10.292
I spent a lot of time
trying to hide the way I look

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:12.837
hoping to be recognized
for my ability.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.341
- How's it going so far?
- Well, let me put it this way.

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:20.178
If the way I look gets me in the door,
then God help them when I get through.

01:17:20.262 --> 01:17:23.056
You're a remarkable woman,
Miss Scott.

01:17:25.017 --> 01:17:26.977
Shall we?

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.979
Yeah.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:44.497
Enemy fleet bears 042 degrees.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.125
Captain,
they bear 042 degrees

01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:51.379
range 182 miles,
course 180, speed 12.

01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:53.464
Very well.
Keep me advised.

01:18:03.726 --> 01:18:07.439
35 degrees, 17 miles north,
northwest of Pearl.

01:18:07.522 --> 01:18:09.149
Laurel, are you all right?

01:18:09.232 --> 01:18:12.236
Miss Scott, I'm Matt Yelland,
skipper of this ship.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.905
Thank you for your hospitality,
Captain

01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:15.406
but I insist you fly
Miss Scott and myself

01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:17.491
to Pearl Harbor immediately.

01:18:21.787 --> 01:18:25.416
- Very well. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:28.295
Follow this officer. He'll see
that you're fully equipped

01:18:28.378 --> 01:18:30.881
and then escort you
to the hangar deck.

01:18:30.966 --> 01:18:32.425
Thank you, Captain.

01:18:34.635 --> 01:18:37.888
- Charlie?
- Forget about the dog. He'll be all right.

01:18:37.973 --> 01:18:42.103
Wait a minute, Captain.
I think you're making a big mistake here.

01:18:42.186 --> 01:18:46.733
That man mysteriously disappeared
on December 7, 1941. That's today, sir.

01:18:46.858 --> 01:18:50.112
Now, at the present time, he
is the front-running candidate

01:18:50.153 --> 01:18:53.573
for the vice presidential spot
on the Democratic ticket in 1944.

01:18:53.656 --> 01:18:55.284
And if he survives,
he's almost certain

01:18:55.368 --> 01:18:57.411
to become the president
of the United States

01:18:57.495 --> 01:19:00.123
when Roosevelt dies
in April of 1945.

01:19:00.206 --> 01:19:05.461
Sir, don't you think he'd be a whole lot
safer to stay on the ship for the time being?

01:19:05.503 --> 01:19:09.924
Mr. Lasky, my job is to make decisions
here, now

01:19:10.009 --> 01:19:12.344
not worry about what politician
may be in the White House

01:19:12.427 --> 01:19:15.264
- four years from now or 40 years ago.
- But, sir...

01:19:15.347 --> 01:19:18.308
And right now, I don't like
having two civilians on my ship

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:19.726
when I'm about to do battle.

01:19:19.809 --> 01:19:22.730
You've got three civilians.

01:19:22.813 --> 01:19:25.275
Mr. Lasky, you're free
to go with them if you like.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.623
Dick.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:43.671
Just got enough time to drop them off
on a deserted spot on this island.

01:19:43.754 --> 01:19:45.756
Not Pearl, sir?

01:19:45.839 --> 01:19:48.551
Hell, no. They'll be
a whole lot safer there.

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:52.139
We'll equip them
to look after themselves till it's over.

01:19:52.222 --> 01:19:55.434
I'll feel a lot easier
with them off my hands.

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.519
Yes, sir.

01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:03.192
Be sure you're back by 0700.

01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:06.279
I want my best man
commanding that strike force.

01:20:06.362 --> 01:20:08.781
Yes, sir.

01:20:15.746 --> 01:20:18.834
Now hear this.
Now hear this.

01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:20.669
All hands, stand by

01:20:20.752 --> 01:20:23.840
for special announcement
from the captain in 15 minutes.

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.853
What are you doing here,
Mr. Lasky?

01:20:34.936 --> 01:20:37.606
I wanna go to
Pearl Harbor with you.

01:20:43.612 --> 01:20:48.118
Wait a minute.
You're not going to Pearl, are you?

01:20:52.955 --> 01:20:54.832
Do they know?

01:21:29.955 --> 01:21:34.919
Captain, enemy fleet 170 miles
north, northwest Pearl.

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:40.925
The Japanese fleet now bears
055 degrees, 162 miles.

01:21:55.191 --> 01:21:56.317
Look at all this ordnance.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.071
Yeah, it's gotta be
the real thing.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.492
Watch that wing tip!

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.920
This is the captain.

01:22:14.003 --> 01:22:16.881
I'm speaking to every man
aboard this ship.

01:22:17.006 --> 01:22:20.469
In the past few hours,
many things have happened

01:22:20.594 --> 01:22:23.222
but rumors
of nuclear attacks

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:26.643
and a third world war
are totally untrue.

01:22:26.727 --> 01:22:30.731
We have no reason to believe
that any aggression has been taken

01:22:30.814 --> 01:22:34.193
against our homes
and families.

01:22:34.235 --> 01:22:39.199
I believe that what we have stumbled
across is not man-made

01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:42.869
but a phenomena of nature.

01:22:42.952 --> 01:22:46.498
One that
can't be explained.

01:22:46.581 --> 01:22:50.169
Now, this phenomena is a storm
which the Nimitz went through

01:22:50.253 --> 01:22:52.838
less than 18 hours ago.

01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:56.843
This storm has had some effect
on time as we know it.

01:22:56.885 --> 01:23:02.516
It created a portal,
a door into another era.

01:23:03.642 --> 01:23:07.605
Today is December 7, 1941.

01:23:08.856 --> 01:23:13.403
I'm sure we're all aware
of the significance of this date

01:23:13.486 --> 01:23:15.780
and its place in history.

01:23:15.863 --> 01:23:18.699
We're about to fight a battle
that was lost

01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:21.495
before most of you
were born.

01:23:21.578 --> 01:23:25.958
This time, with God's help

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.044
it's going to be different.

01:23:28.597 --> 01:23:29.723
Good luck.

01:24:26.763 --> 01:24:30.353
Hey, Charlie.

01:24:30.436 --> 01:24:34.148
Good boy.
Where you been hiding?

01:24:34.232 --> 01:24:37.363
You wanna come with me?
Come on, boy.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:46.459
Eagle Control, 736.

01:24:46.501 --> 01:24:48.962
E. T.A. destination
three minutes.

01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:37.239
All right, let's move it!

01:25:40.077 --> 01:25:42.414
This isn't Pearl Harbor!

01:25:42.539 --> 01:25:45.000
Following orders,
Commander?

01:25:45.084 --> 01:25:47.629
That's right, Senator.

01:26:22.388 --> 01:26:24.432
Is Commander Owens
in the air yet?

01:26:24.516 --> 01:26:26.519
- No, sir.
- Let me know the moment he's airborne.

01:26:26.602 --> 01:26:28.605
Yes, sir.

01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:32.736
Why didn't you
go with them?

01:26:32.819 --> 01:26:34.947
I wasn't invited.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.885
Skipper,
it's time to go.

01:26:49.968 --> 01:26:53.057
Then let's go...
to Pearl Harbor.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.185
You shoot that in here,
we're all going up.

01:26:55.268 --> 01:26:58.940
Then you better do what I say.
Take off. Now!

01:27:37.787 --> 01:27:39.832
Don't let it go off!

01:27:42.961 --> 01:27:46.925
- I lost it. I lost the helo!
- What?

01:27:47.009 --> 01:27:50.139
I tell you, I lost it.
It just disappeared from the scope.

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:54.310
What the hell do you mean
it just disappeared?

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.480
That's it, Captain.

01:27:55.563 --> 01:27:58.526
One second it was on the scope,
the next it was gone.

01:27:58.609 --> 01:27:59.944
Search party?

01:28:02.447 --> 01:28:05.285
It's too late. Officer of the deck,
turn the Nimitz into the wind.

01:28:05.368 --> 01:28:07.413
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:10.835
- Launch aircraft.
- Yes, sir, Captain.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:16.259
That's it. Let's go. Cats, you got
green lights. Get 'em in the air!

01:30:36.002 --> 01:30:38.338
Victory 210,
this is Zulu-5-Bravo.

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.846
Your vector 120.
Estimated time of intercept 0740. Over.

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:48.477
Zulu-5-Bravo,
this is Victory 210.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.522
Nine minutes
to intercept.

01:30:52.525 --> 01:30:56.030
Sir, I think
you oughta see this.

01:30:56.113 --> 01:30:58.533
It suddenly appeared
behind us.

01:31:01.413 --> 01:31:04.375
I don't believe this.
It's starting again.

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.212
Do you think
we can outrun it?

01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:11.218
Maybe we oughta be asking ourselves
should we even be trying to outrun it.

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.722
Six minutes to intercept.

01:31:14.514 --> 01:31:16.726
Change course to 180.

01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:20.356
- All ahead, flank speed.
- Steady course 180.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.569
- Come to course 180, aye, sir.
- All ahead flank.

01:31:23.652 --> 01:31:27.116
- Indicate 125 R.P.M.
- All ahead flank, indicate 125 R.P.M.

01:31:39.675 --> 01:31:42.304
Zulu-5-Bravo,
this is Victory 210.

01:31:42.387 --> 01:31:46.769
I have enemy bandits on radar.
Approximately four minutes to intercept.

01:31:46.769 --> 01:31:50.149
210, this is Zulu-5-Bravo.
You're cleared to arm.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.580
Sir, when we changed course,
the storm changed course.

01:32:00.663 --> 01:32:03.585
It's following us
and growing at the same time.

01:32:03.668 --> 01:32:06.256
I'm recalling those planes.

01:32:06.381 --> 01:32:08.885
- Wait a minute, sir. You can't do that.
- What are you talking about?

01:32:08.968 --> 01:32:11.054
We've got an incredible
opportunity here.

01:32:11.138 --> 01:32:13.975
We know where all the mistakes
are gonna be made for the next 40 years

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:16.103
and you've got the power
to correct them.

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.482
You stay out of this.

01:32:19.524 --> 01:32:22.404
Scrub the mission.
Get those planes back.

01:32:30.456 --> 01:32:33.796
Your signal is Buster.
I say again, your signal is Buster.

01:32:33.837 --> 01:32:36.465
Read you loud and clear.

01:32:36.549 --> 01:32:38.803
Strike Force,
this is Strike Leader.

01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:42.057
Return to base.
Mission aborted.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.353
Mission aborted?
But we can see 'em?

01:32:45.437 --> 01:32:48.357
Shit, they're gonna
let the Japs do it again.

01:32:53.031 --> 01:32:56.077
This is the captain.
Now hear this, men.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.540
We've been through it once,
we're going through it again.

01:32:59.582 --> 01:33:02.502
Prepare for approaching storm.

01:33:21.279 --> 01:33:24.409
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin.

01:33:27.538 --> 01:33:32.545
The enemy bombers appeared
over Pearl Harbor at about 7:55 a.m.

01:33:48.027 --> 01:33:50.947
December 7, 1941...

01:33:52.783 --> 01:33:56.246
a date which will live
in infamy...

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.114
- Any contact with our planes?
- No, sir.

01:34:20.156 --> 01:34:23.327
Keep trying.

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:26.373
- Dan, get me a damage report.
- Right, Skipper.

01:34:26.415 --> 01:34:28.626
- Get a phone check with all stations.
- Yes, sir.

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.753
- You have control of the rudder.
- Bridge has control of the rudder, sir.

01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:34.301
- Very well.
- All stations who experienced contact.

01:34:41.937 --> 01:34:44.565
There they are!
Lo, on the right!

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:58.464
Stand by to render honors
to port U.S.S. Arizona.

01:36:00.632 --> 01:36:02.927
Attention to port.

01:36:03.012 --> 01:36:04.472
And salute.

01:36:06.016 --> 01:36:07.434
Two. Carry on.

01:36:16.322 --> 01:36:19.160
Pacific Fleet arriving.

01:36:27.088 --> 01:36:29.258
3rd Fleet arriving.

01:36:35.182 --> 01:36:37.310
Carrier Group 8 arriving.

01:36:44.905 --> 01:36:46.908
Matt, what the hell's
going on here?

01:36:46.991 --> 01:36:48.493
Admiral, I don't know
where to begin.

01:36:48.576 --> 01:36:50.746
Aircraft carrier getting lost
in the Pacific Ocean.

01:36:50.829 --> 01:36:52.332
What kind of navy is this?

01:36:57.798 --> 01:37:00.719
He'll never believe it.

01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:39.984
Captain, the admirals
have departed.

01:37:40.068 --> 01:37:41.569
Thank you.

01:37:44.407 --> 01:37:47.120
You seem to have a 40-year-old dog
on your hands.

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.748
Yeah, you could say that.

01:37:49.789 --> 01:37:52.793
- Good luck, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Mr. Thurman. Good-bye.

01:37:56.383 --> 01:37:58.469
You know, in a way, Captain,
I think we're lucky.

01:37:58.594 --> 01:38:00.597
How's that?

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.018
At least we came back
to the same world we left.

01:38:04.102 --> 01:38:06.688
Most of us have.

01:38:06.813 --> 01:38:09.818
Did Commander Owens
have any family?

01:38:09.902 --> 01:38:11.487
No one.

01:38:12.822 --> 01:38:15.701
Lasky, you've been
a pain in the ass.

01:38:17.121 --> 01:38:18.497
But I'm glad to have known you.

01:38:18.539 --> 01:38:20.542
Thank you, Captain.
I appreciate that.

01:38:20.625 --> 01:38:21.877
Good luck to you.

01:38:23.421 --> 01:38:24.673
And you too.

01:38:37.442 --> 01:38:40.362
Wait a minute, boy. Here, Charlie!
Charlie, come back here.

01:38:49.459 --> 01:38:52.629
Mr. and Mrs. Tideman
would like you to join them.

01:38:59.389 --> 01:39:01.351
Mr. Tideman?

01:39:10.029 --> 01:39:13.326
Welcome back, Mr. Lasky.

01:39:13.409 --> 01:39:17.165
Laurel.
Commander Owens.

01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:20.753
Please, join us.

01:39:24.509 --> 01:39:27.137
We have a lot to talk about.
