Right in the lens.

00:46.728 --> 00:49.063
Yeah... Yeah, that's the way.

00:49.130 --> 00:50.864

Yes! That's what

Right here, right here.
Yes! Yeah.

back to the changing

Uh, new wardrobe,
and back in ten.

01:33.224 --> 01:35.275

01:35.343 --> 01:36.276

I'm way more than okay.

01:48.323 --> 01:51.191
So, baby, I've been thinking
that maybe

01:51.259 --> 01:53.494
we stayed here
a couple more days.

01:53.545 --> 01:55.245
We fly your family in

Sure.

Were you bummed when Jenny Shaun

05:44.726 --> 05:46.893
Ho, little one,
you cut to the bone, huh?

05:47.812 --> 05:49.763
Yeah, I was pretty bummed.

05:49.814 --> 05:52.032

How long have you known Suzie?

06:05.079 --> 06:06.580
Five years.

06:06.631 --> 06:08.832
They diagnosed her
with cystic fibrosis

06:08.916 --> 06:10.250
when she was
six months old.

06:10.318 --> 06:11.668
And now she's surfing.

06:11.753 --> 06:13.854
And being in the saltwater mist,
where she can breathe better,

06:13.921 --> 06:16.623
is the best medicine for her.
Yeah.

06:35.309 --> 06:36.360

06:52.710 --> 06:54.294
Hey, Kono.

06:54.345 --> 06:56.263
Hey.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.932
All right, so our vic's name
is Renny Sinclair.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.534
He's a big-time
photographer.

07:00.601 --> 07:03.336
He's was in Oahu for three days
shooting a swimsuit spread.

07:03.388 --> 07:05.522
According to witnesses,
Renny was inside his trailer

07:05.606 --> 07:08.108
when it caught fire,
and then exploded.

07:08.175 --> 07:09.943
I'm thinking incendiary device.
Why do you think

07:10.010 --> 07:11.361
it was murder
and not an accident?

07:11.446 --> 07:14.197
Oh, well, if you'll follow me
here, to Exhibit "A"...

07:14.282 --> 07:16.015
we have a 13 mill
steel shackle lock.

07:16.067 --> 07:19.018
The firemen had to cut the door
handle off to get it open.

07:19.070 --> 07:20.287
Once someone slapped that on,

07:20.354 --> 07:21.588
Renny never stood a chance
of getting out.

07:21.656 --> 07:23.690
You guys got to see this.

07:23.741 --> 07:26.927
This might be where our
killer's inspiration came from.

07:29.130 --> 07:30.580
"Worship me"?

07:30.665 --> 07:33.049
What is this,
life imitating art?

07:33.134 --> 07:34.084
STEVE:

07:34.168 --> 07:35.936
Anybody who burns
somebody alive,

07:36.003 --> 07:37.871
and makes him suffer
the way he suffered...

07:37.939 --> 07:40.507
this was personal.

07:50.186 --> 07:52.270
STEVE: Okay, Kono,
stick with the crime techs

07:52.355 --> 07:53.738
and finish processing the scene.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.922
Chin. You, me and Danny

07:54.974 --> 07:56.408
are going to go talk
to some witnesses.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.643
We'll start with Renny's
closest associates first.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.278
I'm going to talk to these models.
Okay,

08:00.363 --> 08:01.980
Well, just stay with questions that
relate to the case, all right?

08:02.064 --> 08:03.865
What is that supposed to mean?
What it means is

08:03.932 --> 08:05.800
I know you. I'm just saying
stick to the case.

08:05.868 --> 08:07.268
Hey. Hey. They're just women.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.205
Who happen to be insanely hot
and make millions of dollars.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.457
I didn't know either
of those things. Hmm.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.492
You are so busted.
(Chin laughs)

08:14.577 --> 08:15.543
WOMAN: Are you kidding me?
ALANA: Go!

08:15.611 --> 08:16.911
Go!
Get off of me!

08:16.963 --> 08:18.313
Leave him alone!
You shouldn't even be here! Whoa!

08:18.381 --> 08:20.281
Get off!
Hey, hey.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.883
Go! Hey! Hey!

08:21.950 --> 08:23.168
She did it. She killed him.
Hey! Hey!

08:23.252 --> 08:25.453
He didn't love her anymore,
so she killed him.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.556
You are an insane person.
Stay away from me.

08:28.624 --> 08:29.975
Stay away from me.
Whoa, whoa.

08:30.059 --> 08:31.059
What do you got there?

08:34.096 --> 08:36.648
I wanted her to see
what she did.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.198
She didn't just take
Renny away from me,

08:38.267 --> 08:39.534
she took him away
from his child.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.172
STEVE: All right, just a moment.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.024
Danny, come here.
You come with me.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.176
Come on. Come on. You all right?
She's insane.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.397
STEVE: <i>What makes you think</i>
<i>Jordan killed Renny?</i>

08:52.465 --> 08:54.833
She was, uh...

08:54.917 --> 08:56.284
She was jealous
of Renny and me.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.670
Do you still love Renny?

08:58.754 --> 09:00.755
What does that have to do
with anything?

09:00.823 --> 09:03.658
Well, it's relevant. I mean
you guys were a couple, right?

09:03.726 --> 09:04.826
Six months ago.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.228
Okay, well, he and Alana
were about to have a baby.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.296
They were going to get married.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.231
Obviously it kills any chance

09:10.299 --> 09:11.800
of reconciliation
for you guys, right?

09:12.835 --> 09:14.903
I was over Renny.

09:14.970 --> 09:17.172
Jordan wasn't over him.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.710
After Renny broke up with her,
she totally lost it.

09:21.777 --> 09:23.645
Fell apart. I mean...

09:23.696 --> 09:25.613
I don't think she ever
really recovered.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.115
<i>After we broke up,</i>

09:27.183 --> 09:29.517
I wished him well,
and I never looked back.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.186
If he wanted to
be with Alana,

09:31.253 --> 09:32.570
I wasn't going to stand
in the way of that.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.490
She couldn't stand
seeing us together.

09:35.558 --> 09:38.376
Seeing us happy.
JORDAN: Why would I have taken this job

09:38.461 --> 09:40.295
if I wasn't over him?

09:40.362 --> 09:42.714
If I was to turn down every job

09:42.798 --> 09:45.083
because of past relationships
with photographers,

09:45.167 --> 09:46.668
I wouldn't have a career
in this industry.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.138
I know this may sound corny,

09:50.206 --> 09:51.940
but Renny was everything to me.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.346
I don't know where I go
from here.

10:00.216 --> 10:02.016
You go home,

10:02.068 --> 10:04.953
you grieve,
you get strong.

10:07.723 --> 10:09.824
Everyone knew Jordan
still had a thing for Renny,

10:09.892 --> 10:12.393
but she was a complete pro
during the shoot.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.329
Where was she before
the fire started?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.331
Uh, she was supposed to be
in the changing tent,

10:16.398 --> 10:18.333
but I was running around getting
ready for the next set up,

10:18.401 --> 10:20.702
so I can't tell you
for sure.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.787
What about the other models?
How'd they get along with Renny?

10:22.872 --> 10:26.758
From what I can tell,
everyone loved Renny.

10:26.842 --> 10:28.343
How long have you been
working with him?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.928
Um, tomorrow will be a week.

10:30.012 --> 10:31.479
I was a local hire.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.914
To be honest,

10:32.965 --> 10:34.632
I don't even know
most of these people's names.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.018
Was there anyone on set today
who wasn't here working?

10:37.086 --> 10:39.187
Any visitors?
Anyone hanging around

10:39.254 --> 10:41.189
the trailer who wasn't
supposed to be?

10:41.256 --> 10:43.324
There was this guy. Um,

10:43.392 --> 10:44.943
he drove a silver Porsche.

10:45.027 --> 10:47.645
I only remember
because Renny told me

10:47.730 --> 10:49.147
to make sure he was
allowed to drive on

10:49.231 --> 10:50.832
and park next
to his trailer.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.984
Did you get a name or
a license plate number?

10:53.068 --> 10:54.319
I was just told to look out

10:54.403 --> 10:55.820
for a friend of his
driving a silver Porsche.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.273
I waved him on the set
and that was it.

10:58.340 --> 11:00.308
I never even saw
what he looked like.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.550
KONO:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

11:08.617 --> 11:10.118
Uh, Charlie Fong?

11:10.186 --> 11:11.386
I'm Officer...

11:11.454 --> 11:13.822
Kono. How are you?

11:13.889 --> 11:15.957
I'm... good.

11:16.025 --> 11:19.027
That's great. It's really good
to see you again.

11:19.094 --> 11:21.029
I'm sorry. Do I...?

11:21.096 --> 11:22.463
Do we know each other?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.299
I knew you wouldn't remember.

11:24.366 --> 11:26.201
Okay. Um...

11:26.268 --> 11:27.685
Let's get started.

11:31.106 --> 11:32.807
I pulled the data
that you sent over

11:32.858 --> 11:34.209
from the Renny Sinclair
crime scene

11:34.276 --> 11:35.810
and put together
a little reenactment.

11:35.878 --> 11:37.879
Here we have
the two gas cans

11:37.947 --> 11:39.380
that you collected
as evidence.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.915
One was placed
on the exterior,

11:40.983 --> 11:42.417
underneath your
victim's trailer,

11:42.485 --> 11:44.352
and the other was
placed on the interior,

11:44.420 --> 11:45.820
under the bathroom sink.

11:45.888 --> 11:47.839
We never worked
a case together.

11:47.923 --> 11:50.258
No, we haven't.

11:50.326 --> 11:52.660
As I was saying--
once the exterior frame

11:52.711 --> 11:55.396
caught fire, the flames set
off this second gas can,

11:55.464 --> 11:56.664
immediately engulfing

11:56.732 --> 11:57.765
the interior of the trailer.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.234
All right. Were you
able to analyze

11:59.301 --> 12:00.602
the gas sample
we recovered?

12:00.669 --> 12:02.537
I'm running it
through GCMS now.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.305
If it's a viable sample,
it'll tell us

12:04.373 --> 12:06.674
what station this gas
was purchased at.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.209
Very cool.

12:08.277 --> 12:10.511
Yeah. It's amazing.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.863
Chemically speaking.

12:11.947 --> 12:13.898
All right,
so what else do we know?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.885
Found something
inside your melted gas can.

12:18.888 --> 12:20.455
What is all that?

12:20.523 --> 12:22.323
Can't see what it is
from the X-ray,

12:22.391 --> 12:24.259
so I'm having one
of the other techs

12:24.326 --> 12:25.593
take it to an industrial oven.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.878
The only way to extract it

12:26.962 --> 12:28.463
is to carefully melt away
the plastic.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.766
Did you graduate
from Kukui High?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.801
Nope. Punahou.

12:35.204 --> 12:37.238
You're not going
to make this easy, are you?

12:37.306 --> 12:38.573
(chuckles)

12:38.641 --> 12:40.141
Just the crime solving stuff.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.715
CHIN:
Yeah. Yeah,

12:47.766 --> 12:49.817
I got it. 3:00.

12:49.885 --> 12:51.102
I'll be there.

12:51.186 --> 12:53.104
Yeah.

12:54.657 --> 12:56.624
What's going on?

12:56.692 --> 12:59.193
That was I.A.

12:59.261 --> 13:00.912
They want to see me
this afternoon at 3:00.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.998
Your uncle talked
to them, didn't he?

13:04.066 --> 13:05.750
He told them it wasn't me.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.502
And he told
them my Auntie

13:07.569 --> 13:09.203
was dying and needed
a new kidney,

13:09.255 --> 13:12.140
so he stole the $200,000 out
of the asset forfeiture locker

13:12.207 --> 13:13.908
to save her life.
And now, of course,

13:13.959 --> 13:15.760
I.A. officially
reopens the case.

13:15.844 --> 13:18.963
Look, Chin, listen, this
is going to clear your name.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.266
Yeah, it will.

13:21.350 --> 13:23.635
But at what cost?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.454
My uncle was a
righteous cop, Steve.

13:26.522 --> 13:29.090
In his 25 years, he put away
hundreds of criminals--

13:29.141 --> 13:30.858
guys that deserved
to be off the street.

13:30.926 --> 13:33.595
And if he's found guilty,
they'll enact judicial review.

13:33.662 --> 13:35.780
All of his past convictions
can be called into question.

13:35.864 --> 13:37.532
Guilty men will walk
straight out of prison.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.117
So let me call the governor.

13:39.201 --> 13:41.235
No.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.737
It's my problem.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.289
I'll handle it.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.151
What's with him?

13:57.219 --> 13:59.053
His uncle's about
to be arrested.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.891
What did he do?
He told the truth?

14:03.959 --> 14:05.126
Yeah.

14:05.194 --> 14:06.828
Chin's been carrying
this secret for so long,

14:06.895 --> 14:09.731
he'd rather keep living with it
than see his uncle go to jail.

14:09.798 --> 14:11.232
Where have you
been anyway?

14:11.299 --> 14:13.300
Well, I have been doing my job.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.819
Okay, I thoroughly
questioned all the models

14:14.903 --> 14:16.170
on Renny's photo
shoot this morning.

14:16.238 --> 14:18.706
I bet you did.
Get your mind out of the gutter, okay?

14:18.774 --> 14:19.824
I was strictly business.

14:19.908 --> 14:21.175
Okay, turns out

14:21.243 --> 14:22.643
all the ladies
say the same thing--

14:22.695 --> 14:23.861
Jordan and Alana were both

14:23.946 --> 14:26.214
in the changing tent at
the time of the fire.

14:26.281 --> 14:28.249
So Jordan didn't do it?
What'd I just say?

14:28.316 --> 14:29.851
I mean, unless she can
teleport her body, no,

14:29.918 --> 14:31.536
she didn't do it.
So we got no suspects on this?

14:31.620 --> 14:32.920
Hold on. Relax. Okay?

14:32.988 --> 14:35.707
I had HPD run Renny's financials
and his phone records.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.842
Look at this.
Guy's like a 15-year-old girl.

14:37.926 --> 14:40.345
All text messages,
no phone calls.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.433
Why is a fashion photographer
sending coded texts?

14:45.500 --> 14:46.768
All right. You know what?

14:46.835 --> 14:48.019
I'm going to send this
to Catherine.

14:48.103 --> 14:49.670
She can have the, uh,
the boys in intel

14:49.722 --> 14:50.855
run it through...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:50.939 --> 14:52.339
What?
It's not coded texts.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.175
Okay? No need
for your little Ramboette.

14:54.243 --> 14:56.944
Okay, this is not your, uh,
cloak-and-dagger spook speak.

14:57.012 --> 14:58.029
This is Danny's world. Oh?

14:58.113 --> 14:59.180
These are bets.
Bets?

14:59.248 --> 15:00.448
What are you talking about, bets?
Yeah.

15:00.515 --> 15:01.949
Guy had action
all over the place.

15:02.017 --> 15:04.035
BOS minus eight-- that's Boston
Celtics, minus eight points.

15:04.119 --> 15:05.953
NYK, 2.5--
that's the Knicks

15:06.021 --> 15:07.255
minus two and
a half points.

15:07.322 --> 15:08.456
Check you out.
Guy was an animal.

15:08.523 --> 15:09.991
Bets all over the place.
What else you got?

15:10.059 --> 15:11.225
I'll show you.
Look at this.

15:14.797 --> 15:18.199
Guy's got open credit markers
all over Vegas.

15:18.267 --> 15:20.635
Mandalay,
Caesars, Bellagio.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.470
Look at the bank records.

15:22.537 --> 15:25.056
Every dollar that comes in
goes straight back out again.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.540
He's a cash poor
kind of guy.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.375
Yeah, strapped for cash, but
he's still banking bets, right?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.377
So, if he can't come up with
the dough, what does that mean?

15:30.429 --> 15:31.712
It means
he's burning his bookie.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.249
Yeah, then maybe the bookie did
the same thing to him.

15:48.623 --> 15:50.441
Chin.

15:50.472 --> 15:52.106
I knew you'd be here.

15:52.165 --> 15:53.382
Why is that?

15:53.449 --> 15:55.501
'Cause of all
the fishing spots you know,

15:55.585 --> 15:57.686
you never once caught
anything here worth keeping.

15:59.722 --> 16:02.224
I figured you're here more
to think than to fish.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.725
(chuckling)

16:03.793 --> 16:05.811
You shouldn't
have come here.

16:07.129 --> 16:09.765
Since I.A. opened
this investigation,

16:09.816 --> 16:11.733
you're in violation

16:11.801 --> 16:14.319
of a department mandate
if you have contact with me.

16:14.404 --> 16:16.905
Uncle, I.A. called me.

16:16.973 --> 16:20.809
I have to appear before a
review board this afternoon.

16:20.877 --> 16:23.212
That's good.

16:23.279 --> 16:25.113
Tell them the truth.

16:26.316 --> 16:29.317
The truth doesn't
matter anymore.

16:29.369 --> 16:31.503
What matters now is
keeping you out of jail.

16:31.588 --> 16:35.924
You don't have
to be silent any longer, Chin.

16:35.992 --> 16:37.459
You owe me nothing.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.061
I owe you everything.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.396
I need you to
go back to I.A.

16:41.464 --> 16:43.164
and tell them
that since Auntie died,

16:43.216 --> 16:44.516
you haven't been thinking
clearly.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.268
Chin...

16:46.335 --> 16:48.020
That you didn't know
what you were saying.

16:48.104 --> 16:49.838
I need you to go back

16:49.889 --> 16:52.474
and tell them that
I took the money.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.229
I'm not telling them that.

16:59.282 --> 17:02.451
Telling them that
could put you in jail.

17:02.518 --> 17:05.654
I'm not lying anymore.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.544
FONG:
<i>GCMS findings</i>

17:12.628 --> 17:15.063
are back on the gas our killer
used to start the fire.

17:15.131 --> 17:16.598
He bought 87 octane.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.367
That doesn't help us.

17:18.434 --> 17:20.868
87 is the most widely used
octane of gas, but

17:20.920 --> 17:23.222
the additives are a match
to a local chain--

17:23.306 --> 17:24.640
Lex Brodie's Gas.

17:24.707 --> 17:26.942
How many stations are
there on the Island?

17:27.010 --> 17:28.175
(computer chirping)

17:28.243 --> 17:29.778
Twelve.

17:29.846 --> 17:32.347
So all we have to do is match
this gas sediment fingerprint

17:32.415 --> 17:33.715
to a specific Lex
Brodie Station,

17:33.783 --> 17:35.567
and we know where our
killer bought the gas.

17:35.652 --> 17:36.752
Exactly.

17:36.819 --> 17:38.887
What are you so happy about?

17:38.955 --> 17:41.924
We now have to collect samples
from 12 different stations.

17:41.991 --> 17:44.726
That's cool.
I need gas anyway.

17:44.794 --> 17:46.228
Cool tech.

17:46.296 --> 17:48.297
You're not the only
nerd on the block.

17:48.364 --> 17:50.365
Let's roll.

17:53.503 --> 17:56.404
CHIN: <i>I think I just found</i>
<i>that mystery guest</i>

17:56.456 --> 17:58.257
who paid a visit
to our vic this morning.

17:58.341 --> 18:00.592
Witness I spoke to said
he was driving a silver Porsche,

18:00.677 --> 18:02.277
right?
Right.

18:02.345 --> 18:05.681
I pulled this off a traffic
cam near the crime scene.

18:05.748 --> 18:07.816
Time code places it
on the road right around T.O.D.

18:07.884 --> 18:09.785
Perfect. You run the plates?

18:09.852 --> 18:11.253
Mm-hmm.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.972
Comes right back
to a shell corporation.

18:14.057 --> 18:16.825
It's just the kind of move
you'd expect from...

18:16.893 --> 18:19.427
Derek Marcum.

18:19.479 --> 18:20.562
You know him?
Yeah.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.147
I busted him years back
when he was small-time.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.932
Now he's major league.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.336
Actually, he runs most of the
betting action on the Island.

18:27.403 --> 18:29.338
Oh, he's a bookie, huh?

18:29.405 --> 18:32.040
Mm-hmm. I wonder if Marcum
was taking bets from our vic.

18:32.108 --> 18:34.409
Oh, we have evidence that says
Renny had a gambling problem.

18:34.460 --> 18:35.661
How do we find this guy?

18:35.745 --> 18:36.912
You don't.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.547
From what I hear,
he's by referral only.

18:38.614 --> 18:40.182
Okay, we just have
to find somebody

18:40.249 --> 18:41.650
who can give us an introduction.

18:49.842 --> 18:51.843
♪ ♪

19:22.558 --> 19:25.961
Okay, so, all the bets were
texted to Marcum's prepaid cell.

19:26.012 --> 19:28.430
I took the numbers
and made a client list.

19:28.498 --> 19:30.849
Okay, good. We just get one of
Marcum's clients to give him up.

19:30.933 --> 19:34.069
Yeah, I got the perfect guy.
Real whale.

19:34.137 --> 19:36.705
Oh, yeah, a high stakes gambler?
No, he's literally a whale.

19:37.940 --> 19:40.075
(sighs)

19:40.143 --> 19:42.611
I'm paying you
for your energy

19:42.679 --> 19:45.047
and your passion.

19:45.114 --> 19:47.649
Come on!

19:47.717 --> 19:49.685
You got to feel
the shave ice,

19:49.752 --> 19:52.037
you got
to be the shave ice.

19:52.121 --> 19:54.456
Come on, supersize that thing.

19:54.523 --> 19:55.874
Come on!

19:55.958 --> 19:57.909
MAN: It's 120 in here,
and I'm gonna pass out.

19:57.994 --> 20:01.997
You like pass out
before or after I pay you?

20:02.048 --> 20:04.049
Hey.
Ah.

20:04.133 --> 20:07.419
Hey, my <i>haole</i> brothers
from another mother.

20:07.503 --> 20:08.737
How you doing?

20:08.805 --> 20:10.472
Howzit? What's with the muppet?

20:10.539 --> 20:12.674
That's an economic stimulator.
Oh.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.926
Brah, this is Hawaii.

20:15.011 --> 20:16.511
Shave ice everywhere.

20:16.562 --> 20:18.546
Saturated market.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.982
It's all about
distinguishing your product,

20:21.050 --> 20:23.384
maximizing your brand awareness.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.153
STEVE:
Well, if you wanted more cash,

20:25.221 --> 20:26.621
maybe you shouldn't have taken
Northwestern last week.

20:26.689 --> 20:29.791
Oh, me? No.
I don't gamble for money, bro.

20:29.859 --> 20:31.660
I'm afraid that's not true.

20:31.728 --> 20:33.912
We know you have
an open account with Marcum.

20:33.996 --> 20:35.280
No, no, no, never.
Never do that.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.448
Oh, I believe you.

20:36.532 --> 20:38.033
Look, this is what I'm gonna do.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.001
I got this number off
of Marcum's phone records.

20:40.069 --> 20:42.237
I'm gonna call it
right now,

20:42.288 --> 20:43.422
and, uh,
I don't know,

20:43.506 --> 20:44.840
we'll see
whose phone rings.

20:46.459 --> 20:48.009
(phone ringing)

20:49.412 --> 20:51.179
You gonna get that?

20:51.247 --> 20:53.215
Grandma.

20:54.016 --> 20:55.934
Hi, dear.

20:56.018 --> 20:57.185
Okay, look,

20:57.253 --> 20:58.586
I don't do
this a lot,

20:58.638 --> 20:59.971
and I'm only
down a little.

21:00.056 --> 21:01.389
No, no, you're not down
a little.

21:01.441 --> 21:03.191
You have not won a bet
in six months.

21:03.259 --> 21:06.144
Okay, you are the worst gambler
of all time.

21:06.229 --> 21:07.762
I try. That's all I can do.

21:07.814 --> 21:09.597
Kamekona, listen,
we need to find Marcum, okay?

21:09.649 --> 21:11.366
That's a tough
bugger to find.

21:11.434 --> 21:13.368
Okay, well,
that-that bugger

21:13.435 --> 21:15.704
is a suspect
in a murder investigation.

21:15.772 --> 21:17.438
And I never seen him.

21:17.490 --> 21:18.773
Okay, but you owe him money,
right?

21:18.825 --> 21:20.325
So does everybody else
who gambles.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.626
STEVE:
Okay, fine.

21:21.711 --> 21:23.245
That's why
you're gonna call his people.

21:23.296 --> 21:24.546
You're gonna tell them
that you're not gonna pay

21:24.614 --> 21:25.964
any of the money back,
not a cent,

21:26.048 --> 21:27.749
and if they got a problem with
that, they know where you work.

21:29.051 --> 21:31.219
No, I can't do that.
I got to pay 'em.

21:31.287 --> 21:32.754
You don't understand.

21:32.805 --> 21:35.307
These are big,
scary guys.

21:35.391 --> 21:36.975
Big scary guys, huh?

21:39.295 --> 21:40.996
This is Kame.

21:41.063 --> 21:42.898
Uh, yeah, I forgot.

21:42.965 --> 21:45.667
Three, two, four, four.

21:45.735 --> 21:47.936
Yeah.

21:49.138 --> 21:51.406
If you want the money
that I owe you,

21:51.474 --> 21:54.075
you're going to have
to come here

21:54.143 --> 21:55.327
and take it from me,

21:55.411 --> 21:58.363
because I am not paying.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.115
(phone beeps off)

22:00.166 --> 22:02.517
That's it. Lesson learned.

22:02.585 --> 22:05.720
If I live through this,
I'm never gambling again.

22:05.788 --> 22:06.922
Yeah, right.

22:06.989 --> 22:09.090
How much you like to bet?

22:09.842 --> 22:10.842
Hmm?

22:10.927 --> 22:12.010
Oh.

22:12.094 --> 22:13.728
All right, last one.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.272
(phone ringing)

22:26.475 --> 22:27.526
Hey, boss.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.010
STEVE: Hey, Kono,
you finish collecting

22:29.061 --> 22:30.078
those gas samples yet?

22:30.146 --> 22:31.746
Yeah. We just got the last one.

22:31.814 --> 22:33.448
We're heading back to the lab now
to see if we can land a match.

22:33.515 --> 22:34.849
Okay, fine.
Listen, we think

22:34.901 --> 22:36.868
we may have a suspect
that we want to move on, okay,

22:36.953 --> 22:37.953
but we're gonna need
some evidence first.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.120
So, let me know
when you get something.

22:39.188 --> 22:40.455
Copy that.

22:40.523 --> 22:43.291
No pressure.

22:43.359 --> 22:44.726
Why don't you put on some tunes.

22:44.794 --> 22:46.728
That always dials down
the pressure.

22:46.796 --> 22:48.914
Yeah. That's a good idea.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.002
Looking for your
Boyz II Men?

22:54.053 --> 22:55.470
(laughing)

22:55.537 --> 22:56.972
♪ ♪

23:01.310 --> 23:03.595
I haven't listened to them
since I was ten years old.

23:03.679 --> 23:06.214
"On Bended Knee"
was your favorite.

23:07.233 --> 23:09.184
Camp Waimea.

23:09.235 --> 23:10.752
That's where I knew you from.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.487
Keep trying.

23:12.554 --> 23:14.489
(groans in frustration)

23:22.415 --> 23:24.833
So, Kamekona,

23:24.900 --> 23:26.868
what's this about you
not wanting to pay Marcum?

23:28.254 --> 23:29.504
You play dumb?

23:29.571 --> 23:31.172
Answer me.

23:34.377 --> 23:35.510
You like getting lickins?

23:35.577 --> 23:36.628
I'm sorry.

23:36.712 --> 23:38.763
I just overheard--
did you say "lickings"?

23:38.848 --> 23:40.215
You know how difficult
it is to sound

23:40.266 --> 23:41.883
like a tough guy when you
use a word like "lickings"?

23:41.934 --> 23:44.185
You should try "beatings." Like,
"I'm gonna give you a beating."

23:44.253 --> 23:46.187
It works, trust me, on a lot
of different levels.

23:46.255 --> 23:47.188
Five-O, guys.

23:47.256 --> 23:48.773
Let's go
take a seat,

23:48.858 --> 23:50.558
keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

23:50.610 --> 23:51.726
Let's have a little chat
about what's going on.

23:51.777 --> 23:53.561
Cool.
All right.

23:53.613 --> 23:55.380
Danny.
Got him.

24:09.211 --> 24:10.712
(tires screech, horn honks)

24:18.387 --> 24:19.454
(screams)

24:21.123 --> 24:22.924
Let me ask you a question:
what part

24:22.975 --> 24:25.010
of "sit down and chat"
did you not understand,

24:25.094 --> 24:26.227
huh?

24:38.294 --> 24:40.245
Open the door.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.665
Stay there,
stay there.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.916
All right, come on.

24:43.984 --> 24:47.052
(phone ringing)

24:47.120 --> 24:49.021
Go through. Go.

24:49.089 --> 24:52.424
Let's go, everybody up.
Up, up, up, up, up right now.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.892
Into the office.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.794
Let's go,
huddle, huddle, huddle.

24:56.813 --> 24:58.814
All right,

24:58.898 --> 25:00.132
nice, huddle up
the back there,

25:00.183 --> 25:01.567
keep each other warm
with your bodies,

25:01.634 --> 25:04.069
take a seat
on the floor.

25:04.137 --> 25:05.237
Very good.

25:05.305 --> 25:06.321
Now, take a seat.

25:06.406 --> 25:08.540
Derek Marcum,
you stay standing.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.409
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

25:10.477 --> 25:11.827
That way everybody gets
to go home

25:11.911 --> 25:13.829
at the end of the day,
all right?

25:13.913 --> 25:15.313
Gentlemen, I take it you're part

25:15.365 --> 25:17.116
of Honolulu's
law enforcement community.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.617
What, uh...

25:18.668 --> 25:20.335
what gave us away?

25:20.420 --> 25:21.787
You're wearing a tie in Hawaii.

25:21.855 --> 25:22.955
Do us a favor, take a seat.

25:23.006 --> 25:25.257
I want to ask you
a couple questions.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.458
MARCUM:
So what's this about?

25:26.509 --> 25:28.877
This is about Renny Sinclair.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.346
DANNY: We have you on camera
leaving a photo shoot

25:31.431 --> 25:33.499
right after Renny was killed.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.169
Renny's dead? What happened?

25:38.138 --> 25:39.521
Well, what I think happened

25:39.606 --> 25:41.390
is that he owes you
a gambling debt

25:41.474 --> 25:44.810
and you couldn't come up with
the dough, so you killed him.

25:44.878 --> 25:47.279
I didn't kill him.

25:47.347 --> 25:49.848
Renny was a friend.

25:49.899 --> 25:51.150
I don't use that word lightly.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.453
Okay, all right,
but just so I understand,

25:54.521 --> 25:58.240
he did owe you money, right,
and you obviously wanted it.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.825
Hypothetically speaking,

25:59.876 --> 26:01.794
if I were involved
in illegal bookmaking,

26:01.861 --> 26:03.162
I wouldn't kill a client.

26:03.213 --> 26:06.081
Dead clients tend to have
trouble clearing debts.

26:06.166 --> 26:07.299
He's got a point.

26:07.366 --> 26:11.136
That being said,
in this hypothetical situation,

26:11.204 --> 26:13.138
no, Renny did not owe me
a gambling debt.

26:13.206 --> 26:14.273
DANNY:
Okay, so

26:14.340 --> 26:15.474
what were you doing
at the photo shoot?

26:15.541 --> 26:18.677
I'm in a cash
business, gentlemen.

26:18.728 --> 26:21.096
Sometimes that leaves
me with a reserve.

26:21.164 --> 26:24.049
From time to time I lend that
reserve out for a profit.

26:24.117 --> 26:26.101
Renny came to me,

26:26.186 --> 26:28.103
he asked to borrow some money,
I gave it to him.

26:28.188 --> 26:29.288
How much?

26:29.355 --> 26:32.741
$291,570.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.127
That's a very specific amount.

26:35.195 --> 26:36.578
Did he tell you what it was for?

26:36.663 --> 26:38.597
You know, banks ask those kind

26:38.665 --> 26:40.332
of questions of their clients;
I don't.

26:47.507 --> 26:49.441
STEVE:
What's that?

26:49.509 --> 26:52.211
That's how he was
going to repay me.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.629
He signed over the
first 400 large

26:53.713 --> 26:55.948
of his book's
profits to me.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.299
Renny mints cash
with these things.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.135
STEVE:
Okay.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.353
If this contract is legit...

27:02.188 --> 27:03.588
...then that helps your cause.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.058
But if it's not, that proves
to us that you did not want

27:06.126 --> 27:07.793
Renny alive to dispute
your claims.

27:07.861 --> 27:09.812
In the meantime,
let me see your hands.

27:09.896 --> 27:10.829
We're changing venues.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.765
For what, gambling,

27:13.817 --> 27:14.900
lending money?

27:14.951 --> 27:16.101
You do realize I'm
gonna post bail

27:16.152 --> 27:17.669
and be out in a few hours?

27:17.737 --> 27:30.449
Yeah, that's true, but it'll
give us a little time to decide

27:30.517 --> 27:32.718
You don't know me from surfing.

27:34.187 --> 27:35.587
Nice try, though.

27:36.589 --> 27:38.090
Bingo.

27:38.141 --> 27:40.342
The gas your killer used
to torch your vic

27:40.426 --> 27:41.927
was purchased
on Miahi Avenue

27:41.995 --> 27:44.029
near Kukapu.
Nice.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.731
So hopefully our killer used
a credit card

27:45.798 --> 27:46.982
so we can pull those receipts

27:47.066 --> 27:49.434
and cross-reference
with any suspects.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.070
Hey, hey, we'll
need to run this

27:52.138 --> 27:53.138
through handwriting
analysis,

27:53.206 --> 27:55.574
okay, verify that Renny
actually signed it.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.192
All right, we also
have to make sure

27:57.277 --> 27:58.694
that he didn't sign
it under duress.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.046
And there's the $291,570--

28:01.114 --> 28:02.948
a very specific
amount of dough,

28:02.999 --> 28:04.499
obviously for something
very specific.

28:04.584 --> 28:05.817
Know what?
I'll have HPD

28:05.885 --> 28:08.203
forensic accountants dig
deeper into his financials,

28:08.288 --> 28:11.256
see if they can find
that exact amount anywhere.

28:11.324 --> 28:13.325
All right?
Hmm.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.212
(phone ringing)

28:24.003 --> 28:26.004
Look, I'm gonna tell I.A.
that I took the money.

28:26.055 --> 28:27.806
If you're calling to talk me
out of it, don't bother.

28:27.857 --> 28:30.943
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm calling
to say good luck, okay?

28:34.247 --> 28:36.248
Mahalo.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.754
Against my better judgment,
Officer Kelly,

28:42.822 --> 28:44.590
this board will entertain
your statement

28:44.657 --> 28:45.991
with regards
to the missing money

28:46.059 --> 28:48.360
from the asset
forfeiture locker.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.232
Chairman Akahoshi...

28:53.299 --> 28:57.703
my uncle was devastated
by the death of my aunt,

28:57.770 --> 28:58.837
and in a misguided attempt

28:58.905 --> 29:01.139
to help me salvage
my career with HPD,

29:01.207 --> 29:03.208
he tried to implicate himself.

29:04.227 --> 29:06.395
But the truth is...

29:07.413 --> 29:10.098
...I took the money.

29:13.486 --> 29:16.221
Let me understand this.

29:16.289 --> 29:18.957
You were accused
of stealing this money--

29:19.025 --> 29:23.895
an accusation which
you denied and fought

29:23.947 --> 29:26.031
to the point
of resigning from HPD...

29:26.099 --> 29:28.767
That's correct.

29:28.835 --> 29:29.751
And yet now,

29:29.836 --> 29:31.770
after your uncle comes forward,

29:31.838 --> 29:34.506
you're telling us
you took the money?

29:35.675 --> 29:37.609
Yes, sir, that's correct.

29:37.677 --> 29:39.711
He was lying

29:39.779 --> 29:41.647
to protect me.

29:41.714 --> 29:44.883
How do we know you're not lying
to protect him?

29:44.951 --> 29:47.486
And how would you
explain the fact

29:47.553 --> 29:50.222
that after years of
monitoring your finances,

29:50.290 --> 29:52.224
we've turned up
absolutely nothing--

29:52.275 --> 29:55.927
no large transactions,
no new accounts,

29:55.995 --> 29:58.397
no sign

29:58.464 --> 30:01.166
of that money anywhere.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.404
That's because I never spent it.

30:30.179 --> 30:33.181
♪ ♪

30:39.472 --> 30:41.573
You met with I.A.,
didn't you?

30:43.242 --> 30:45.243
I told them I took the money.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.016
Did they believe you?

30:52.051 --> 30:55.487
Not right away.

30:55.555 --> 30:58.156
They said they'd been tracking
my spending habits for years.

30:59.459 --> 31:01.693
So I told them I didn't
spend any of it.

31:01.761 --> 31:03.695
They then

31:03.763 --> 31:06.531
ordered me to produce
all the money

31:06.599 --> 31:08.600
by the end of the day tomorrow.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.438
(phone ringing)

31:16.876 --> 31:19.244
Chin, you don't have
that kind of money.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.680
I know.

31:21.748 --> 31:23.048
No one
in our family does,

31:23.116 --> 31:26.651
and you can't go to the bank
'cause they'll know.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.687
So where are you going
to get it from?

31:28.755 --> 31:30.655
(claps hands)

31:30.723 --> 31:32.724
(sighs)

31:33.960 --> 31:37.629
You need to go back there
and tell 'em you lied.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.030
Just end this.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.551
It's done.

31:42.635 --> 31:43.769
I'm not going back.

31:43.836 --> 31:45.437
(phone ringing)

31:45.505 --> 31:48.039
Now you should answer that.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.409
(phone continues ringing)

31:57.316 --> 31:59.384
STEVE:
Thank you.

31:59.452 --> 32:01.420
Okay, that was
the handwriting analyst,

32:01.487 --> 32:03.438
who just confirmed that Renny
did sign the contract

32:03.523 --> 32:05.723
turning the proceeds
of the book over to Marcum.

32:05.775 --> 32:07.659
No markers indicate that
it was signed under duress.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.077
Okay, well, that's
definitely going to come

32:09.162 --> 32:10.078
as a shock to Marcum.

32:10.163 --> 32:11.163
Uh, I just got
off the phone

32:11.230 --> 32:12.230
with Renny's attorney
in New York.

32:12.281 --> 32:14.699
Apparently his will supersedes

32:14.767 --> 32:16.701
any other arrangements
he might have made.

32:16.752 --> 32:18.770
Okay, who's, uh,
who's the heir to his estate?

32:18.838 --> 32:20.122
That's where it
gets interesting.

32:20.206 --> 32:23.241
Most of Renny's assets are
to be put into a trust,

32:23.309 --> 32:26.077
all going to a woman
named Pauline Lucero.

32:26.129 --> 32:27.479
Who is Pauline Lucero?

32:27.547 --> 32:29.481
I have no idea; we're running
background right now.

32:29.549 --> 32:31.583
She stood to make a lot of money
from Renny's death.

32:31.634 --> 32:32.584
She's got motive.

32:32.635 --> 32:33.751
(talking indistinctly)

32:33.803 --> 32:35.053
Hey.
Hey.

32:35.104 --> 32:37.389
You know that unknown item we
found melted in the gas can?

32:37.457 --> 32:39.558
Yeah.
The lab managed to get it out.

32:48.151 --> 32:50.235
STEVE:
A lighter.

32:50.286 --> 32:52.120
Not just any lighter
It's an Aeros.

32:52.205 --> 32:54.239
These things go
for thousands of dollars.

32:54.290 --> 32:56.575
And our killer used it to light
the fire that killed Renny.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.829
The butane inside heated up
and blew it to pieces.

33:00.913 --> 33:01.946
What do you got?

33:01.998 --> 33:03.915
I thought that
looked familiar.

33:03.966 --> 33:07.085
STEVE:
That's Renny's fiancée.

33:07.136 --> 33:09.171
Alana.
Yeah,

33:09.255 --> 33:11.056
and it's not just the lighter
she's holding.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.192
It's our murder weapon.

33:27.995 --> 33:30.913
Hey.

33:30.981 --> 33:32.548
Can I take a seat?

33:38.488 --> 33:40.256
How you feeling?

33:42.793 --> 33:44.594
As good as I can, I guess.

33:49.883 --> 33:52.501
You remember this?

33:53.687 --> 33:55.638
We shot that in L.A.

33:55.706 --> 33:58.641
Renny insisted
the cake be purple.

33:58.692 --> 34:01.010
They must have
brought five cakes

34:01.078 --> 34:02.344
that weren't
purple enough.

34:05.849 --> 34:07.316
Where'd you find this?

34:07.367 --> 34:10.703
We have reason to believe that
the lighter you're holding

34:10.786 --> 34:14.724
in this picture was the lighter
that was used

34:14.791 --> 34:17.393
to start the fire
that killed Renny.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.728
That was Renny's lighter.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.297
The-the client gave it
to him as a gift

34:21.364 --> 34:22.998
at the end of the shoot.

34:23.065 --> 34:25.134
When was the last time
you saw it?

34:27.838 --> 34:29.388
Yesterday...

34:29.473 --> 34:31.072
in-in Renny's trailer.

34:31.141 --> 34:32.206
Okay. Could he have, uh,

34:32.259 --> 34:34.260
could he have
loaned it to anybody?

34:34.344 --> 34:36.746
That lighter was worth a lot of
money, and Renny cherished it.

34:36.813 --> 34:40.917
I... I don't think he would have
given it to anyone.

34:40.984 --> 34:43.018
But there were a lot of people
on that beach yesterday,

34:43.085 --> 34:46.121
so anyone could have
stolen it from his trailer.

34:46.188 --> 34:47.523
All right.

34:47.574 --> 34:50.242
Listen, have you
ever heard of a woman

34:50.327 --> 34:52.995
named Pauline Lucero?

34:53.063 --> 34:54.196
No. Why?

34:54.264 --> 34:57.116
According to Renny's lawyers,

34:57.200 --> 34:58.951
he had just set up
a trust for her.

34:59.036 --> 35:00.937
A trust?

35:01.004 --> 35:02.338
Why would he do that?

35:02.406 --> 35:05.308
I don't know.

35:05.375 --> 35:08.077
I mean, I...
I know a Shannon Lucero.

35:08.128 --> 35:11.263
She was one of
the first real supermodels.

35:11.348 --> 35:12.381
I used to...

35:12.449 --> 35:14.083
I used to have a picture of her

35:14.134 --> 35:16.385
up in my room
when I was a little girl.

35:16.436 --> 35:18.387
Did Renny know her?

35:18.455 --> 35:19.889
Yeah.

35:19.957 --> 35:22.558
They, uh, they dated
in the early '90s.

35:22.626 --> 35:24.426
I... asked him about it once.

35:24.478 --> 35:27.229
He said it ended badly,
'cause she...

35:27.297 --> 35:29.565
she wanted to get married
and... and have kids,

35:29.616 --> 35:31.283
and he had just
started his career,

35:31.368 --> 35:34.236
and he wasn't ready.

35:34.287 --> 35:36.789
Couple of years ago he heard
she had moved to Milan.

35:36.873 --> 35:40.793
But they...they never really
spoke after the breakup.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.612
(phone ringing)
Excuse me a sec.

35:43.664 --> 35:44.947
Yeah.

35:48.919 --> 35:50.302
Chin.

35:50.387 --> 35:53.139
HPD forensic accountants took
a look at the amount of money

35:53.223 --> 35:55.141
that Renny borrowed from Marcum,
and get this--

35:55.225 --> 35:57.810
their research turned up
that $291,570

35:57.894 --> 36:01.097
is the exact amount that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture

36:01.148 --> 36:04.567
reports that it costs to raise
a child to the age of 18.

36:07.654 --> 36:10.272
All right, listen,
I think Renny and another model

36:10.323 --> 36:12.975
named Shannon Lucero had
a daughter named Pauline, okay?

36:13.026 --> 36:14.827
Run Shannon Lucero
through Interpol

36:14.911 --> 36:16.028
and the Italian Embassy.

36:16.113 --> 36:17.747
Have Kono cross-reference
the name Lucero

36:17.814 --> 36:19.515
against any receipts
from the gas station

36:19.583 --> 36:21.050
we know the killer went to.

36:21.118 --> 36:24.003
You got it.

36:24.087 --> 36:26.839
(beeping)

36:29.259 --> 36:31.493
(beeping)

36:36.683 --> 36:37.967
CHIN: <i>How long have you
been</i> <i>working with him?</i>

36:38.035 --> 36:39.969
Um, tomorrow will be a week.

36:40.037 --> 36:41.837
I was a local hire.

36:43.473 --> 36:46.809
Okay, I just got a hit
on those gas station receipts.

36:46.860 --> 36:48.561
Our mystery woman,
Pauline Lucero,

36:48.645 --> 36:49.845
she purchased the gas

36:49.896 --> 36:51.313
the day Renny was murdered.

36:51.364 --> 36:53.348
She's not
a mystery woman anymore.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.868
Say hello to Amy,
the production assistant.

36:56.903 --> 36:59.989
AKA Pauline Lucero.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.073
She's Renny's daughter.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.126
And our killer.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.480
(tires screech)

37:25.398 --> 37:27.616
Amy, we need to talk to you.

37:41.531 --> 37:42.915
Amy.

37:45.202 --> 37:46.786
It's over. Come on.

37:51.241 --> 37:53.242
(handcuffs clicking)

37:58.799 --> 38:02.184
(indistinct radio transmission)

38:05.655 --> 38:07.606
You know what?
Wait a minute.

38:07.691 --> 38:09.809
Pauline, I got to
ask you something.

38:09.893 --> 38:11.927
How could you kill your father?

38:11.978 --> 38:13.062
He wasn't my father.

38:13.113 --> 38:15.064
Yes, he was your father.
No.

38:15.115 --> 38:17.533
He left when
my mom was pregnant.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.118
He never even knew me.

38:19.202 --> 38:21.403
And when my
mother got sick,

38:21.471 --> 38:23.205
he turned his
back on her.

38:23.273 --> 38:25.908
I tried to
contact him...

38:25.959 --> 38:28.160
but he wouldn't
even take my calls.

38:28.245 --> 38:29.628
DANNY:
Okay, I'm sorry,

38:29.713 --> 38:31.797
so... so you killed him?

38:31.882 --> 38:33.115
I had just buried my mother,

38:33.166 --> 38:35.451
and he didn't want to have
anything to do with me.

38:35.519 --> 38:36.802
All right, so you get

38:36.887 --> 38:38.787
a job on his photo shoot

38:38.855 --> 38:40.840
so you can get
close enough to him

38:40.924 --> 38:43.092
to burn him alive.

38:45.228 --> 38:47.479
He wanted to be worshipped.

38:47.564 --> 38:49.298
Well, now he can be.

38:49.366 --> 38:51.467
DANNY: Well, um,
just so you know,

38:51.535 --> 38:56.505
uh, we did some investigating,
and it seems that your father...

38:56.573 --> 38:58.340
he had a change of heart

38:58.408 --> 39:00.709
when he found out
that Alana was pregnant.

39:00.777 --> 39:03.546
He wanted you
in his life, Pauline.

39:06.366 --> 39:07.950
You're lying.

39:08.001 --> 39:10.169
He set up a trust
in your name.

39:10.253 --> 39:11.620
Started it with

39:11.671 --> 39:14.056
the exact amount of money
he should've spent raising you.

39:16.860 --> 39:19.211
What? Yeah, there's
a private detective

39:19.296 --> 39:21.764
in Italy right now
that he hired looking for you.

39:23.133 --> 39:26.385
Mind your head when
you're getting in the car.

39:36.179 --> 39:38.414
♪ ♪

39:54.564 --> 39:55.998
Hey.

39:56.049 --> 39:58.250
Hey, Kelly!
Oh, my gosh!

39:58.335 --> 39:59.602
It's so good to see you.

39:59.669 --> 40:01.754
I'm glad you made it.
I wouldn't miss it, darling.

40:01.838 --> 40:03.205
I even dragged my cousin
down to help.

40:04.674 --> 40:06.225
Fong?

40:06.309 --> 40:07.576
Hey, Kono.

40:07.644 --> 40:09.011
I heard

40:09.079 --> 40:10.729
you two lovebirds finally worked

40:10.814 --> 40:11.847
a case together.

40:11.898 --> 40:13.215
(laughs)
Oh-whoa, lovebirds?

40:13.283 --> 40:14.383
(laughs)
Kelly, come on.

40:14.434 --> 40:16.402
Wait. You don't remember?

40:16.486 --> 40:18.237
No, I've been trying, but...

40:18.321 --> 40:18.887
Kelly.

40:18.939 --> 40:20.555
My tenth birthday.

40:20.607 --> 40:23.275
My parents let me
throw a coed party,

40:23.360 --> 40:25.077
and while they
were upstairs,

40:25.161 --> 40:27.396
we played spin the bottle.
Oh, my God.

40:27.447 --> 40:29.731
That's what it is!

40:29.783 --> 40:31.200
Oh! Wait, did we?

40:31.251 --> 40:33.035
You were the first
girl I kissed.

40:33.086 --> 40:35.621
Oh! Now I totally remember.

40:35.705 --> 40:36.672
(laughs)

40:36.739 --> 40:39.174
I'm sorry,
my braces cut your lip.

40:39.242 --> 40:40.626
I'm-I'm a big dork.

40:40.710 --> 40:42.244
Well, I don't remember
my lip getting cut.

40:42.295 --> 40:44.096
But I remember you were
a pretty good kisser.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.214
(laughs)

40:45.282 --> 40:46.548
Still am.

40:46.599 --> 40:47.967
Whoa.

40:49.019 --> 40:50.386
Interesting.

40:50.437 --> 40:51.804

40:51.888 --> 40:52.805
KELLY:
Oh, my...

40:52.889 --> 40:55.274
Wow!

40:55.358 --> 40:57.926
Kawika.

40:57.978 --> 40:59.311
Hey.

41:01.531 --> 41:03.282
Are you a surfer?

41:03.366 --> 41:05.868
Uh, no, no, I'm a cop.

41:07.153 --> 41:08.737
That looks like
a surfer's haircut.

41:08.788 --> 41:12.041
This does? No, I can assure you
this is not a surfer's haircut.

41:12.108 --> 41:13.208
Danno don't even swim.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.111
You gonna start
with me now?

41:16.162 --> 41:18.330
I'm still taking surfing
lessons, so you know. Still.

41:18.415 --> 41:20.782
And the word on the
street is that I shred.

41:20.834 --> 41:23.085
I hear Jersey's pretty good.
I'm sure

41:23.136 --> 41:24.420
he's something.

41:24.487 --> 41:25.988
Can we go back out, Kawika?

41:26.056 --> 41:27.306
Shoots.

41:33.029 --> 41:34.963
Hey, where's Chin?

41:35.031 --> 41:39.568
I don't know, he said he had to
do something before he came.

41:42.739 --> 41:45.691
Five-O, look, I answered
all your partner's questions,

41:45.775 --> 41:48.877
I paid my bail--
I'm done talking about Renny.

41:48.945 --> 41:51.313
I'm not here about that.

41:52.515 --> 41:55.200
Okay. I'm listening.

42:06.996 --> 42:10.766
What use would I have
for the deed to your home?

42:12.802 --> 42:15.070
I need $200,000.

42:15.138 --> 42:17.339
And I need it now.
