WEBVTT

00:09.093 --> 00:10.493
All right, ladies, come on!

00:10.495 --> 00:12.562
Overhead!

00:12.564 --> 00:14.864
Down to your left!

00:14.866 --> 00:16.399
To the right!

00:16.401 --> 00:18.267
Back to the middle!

00:18.269 --> 00:19.869
Keep going.
Straight down.

00:19.871 --> 00:21.070
Right down the middle.

00:21.072 --> 00:22.472
Nice and deep.

00:22.474 --> 00:23.640
Morning, Harper.

00:23.642 --> 00:25.341
Morning.

00:25.343 --> 00:26.976
You stalking me?

00:26.978 --> 00:28.911
This is my beach.
I run here every morning.

00:28.913 --> 00:30.313
How do I know
you're not stalking me?

00:30.315 --> 00:32.015
Girls!

00:32.017 --> 00:33.082
Ball down. 50 crunches--

00:33.084 --> 00:35.785
All right, let's do this.

00:35.787 --> 00:36.986
On the ball!

00:36.988 --> 00:38.554
Right now.

00:38.556 --> 00:40.323
If it's too easy,
you're not doing anything.

00:40.325 --> 00:41.991
Up!

00:41.993 --> 00:43.593
Okay, so, all I really
know about you is

00:43.595 --> 00:45.695
you're a doctor
who doesn't date doctors,

00:45.697 --> 00:48.031
and you like to be yelled at
when you work out.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.666
I like to be challenged.

00:49.668 --> 00:51.034
- Oh, is that what you call it?
- Yeah.

00:51.036 --> 00:53.302
This isn't a contest, you know.
You can slow down.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.271
I'm good.
Gets the adrenaline pumping.

00:55.273 --> 00:56.939
Oh, an adrenaline junkie?

00:56.941 --> 00:59.976
I used to be.
Not so much anymore.

00:59.978 --> 01:02.378
In my opinion,
once an adrenaline junkie,

01:02.380 --> 01:04.280
always an adrenaline junkie.

01:04.282 --> 01:06.616
Excellent.
Hey, what's your name?

01:06.618 --> 01:07.917
Huh?
Oh, I'm Hank.

01:09.954 --> 01:11.387
I don't care what your name is!

01:11.389 --> 01:13.456
You're not! In my!
Class!

01:13.458 --> 01:15.058
- I got it.
- You're in trouble.

01:15.060 --> 01:16.092
I'm not in the class.

01:16.094 --> 01:17.126
Stop stalking me.

01:22.433 --> 01:26.035
And, tell Masi that
her favorite niece says hello.

01:26.037 --> 01:27.403
Of course.

01:27.405 --> 01:29.005
Thank you for
letting me stay with you.

01:29.007 --> 01:31.708
Mum, you're always welcome.

01:31.710 --> 01:34.310
Please call me tomorrow.

01:34.312 --> 01:35.311
After your date.

01:35.313 --> 01:37.513
I will.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.849
Please call me tonight
when you land in London.

01:42.553 --> 01:44.687
Anything?

01:44.689 --> 01:47.356
You know your father.
He won't return my call.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.358
He's too stubborn.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.439 --> 02:04.407
Thought for the day...

02:04.409 --> 02:09.211
To impress Hank,
I need to be more like Hank.

02:09.214 --> 02:11.013
"Please, call me Jeremiah.

02:11.014 --> 02:15.284
How can I make you
el better today?"

02:15.286 --> 02:17.487
"Please--"

02:17.489 --> 02:19.489
"Please, call me Jeremiah.

02:19.491 --> 02:21.157
How can I make y--"
Ugh.

02:25.195 --> 02:30.566
Gen-tech Pharmaceuticals
is up 3 to $56.36.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.202
- Call broker.
- Call broker.

02:33.204 --> 02:34.771
Please, call me Jeremiah.

02:34.773 --> 02:36.272
How can I make you
feel better today?

02:36.274 --> 02:37.807
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.643
This is Jeremiah Sacani.
I'd like to buy some stock.

02:43.147 --> 02:44.580
Look, look, look.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.682
I ordered 50 <i>boxes</i>
<i>of alcohol swabs,</i>

02:46.684 --> 02:48.785
not 50 cases.

02:48.787 --> 02:51.220
Yes, I know the difference.
A box fits in my hand.

02:51.222 --> 02:53.122
These cases fill my patio.

02:53.124 --> 02:54.791
And I have a big patio, ma'am.

02:54.793 --> 02:56.692
So, c--

02:56.694 --> 02:58.227
No. No, of cour--

02:58.229 --> 02:59.695
I don't want to
keep them, ma'am.

02:59.697 --> 03:02.431
I want you to pick them up
and credit my account.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.167
Okay, you know what?
Listen, listen, listen.

03:04.169 --> 03:05.735
What's your name?

03:05.737 --> 03:07.170
Your name is "Raven"?

03:07.172 --> 03:08.604
It's a fine name,
it's a great name.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.240
Listen, can--
It's supervisor time, raven.

03:11.242 --> 03:12.308
Please put your su--

03:12.310 --> 03:13.409
Put--
Hello?

03:13.411 --> 03:15.678
Hello?
Why is this happening to me?

03:15.680 --> 03:17.213
I don't have time for this.

03:17.215 --> 03:18.281
What about a surprise?
Do you have time for that?

03:18.283 --> 03:20.349
No, I-I-I
have to do payroll--

03:20.351 --> 03:23.252
- Did you just paint this?
- I did. And...

03:23.254 --> 03:25.688
You are back on
Sidney Bartlett's calendar.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.690
Talented fiancee said what now?

03:27.692 --> 03:29.892
I got you a meeting
at the Blackstone. Today.

03:29.894 --> 03:32.195
- At 11:00.
- Wow. You--

03:32.197 --> 03:33.796
I have no time
for the meeting, but wow.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.398
I can help you
to return the cases--

03:35.400 --> 03:36.532
No, no, no, just--
Just focus on your painting

03:36.534 --> 03:37.600
that's great, I'll be fine.

03:37.602 --> 03:38.968
You know why I'm gonna be fine?

03:38.970 --> 03:40.603
Because I'm meeting
Sidney Bartlett!

03:40.605 --> 03:42.405
Sidney Bartlett,
oh, my g--

03:42.407 --> 03:43.706
How did you do it?

03:43.708 --> 03:45.241
Well, I know
how disappointed you were

03:45.243 --> 03:46.642
when you had to cancel
that first meeting.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.645
So, since my family has
had a membership there for ages,

03:49.647 --> 03:52.081
I just decided
to call in a favor.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.850
I love surprise favors.

03:53.852 --> 03:56.052
All right. Prep me, prep me.
What's this Sidney guy like?

03:56.054 --> 03:57.854
- Come on.
- Okay, he is

03:57.856 --> 03:58.888
a total sweetheart.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.423
He's the kind of guy

04:00.425 --> 04:02.091
who always remembers a name,

04:02.093 --> 04:04.160
and he never forgets a face.
He's like this big, fat,

04:04.162 --> 04:06.896
jolly man with a beard.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.064
So he's like Santa.

04:08.066 --> 04:09.765
Yes! But, instead of coming
down a chimney,

04:09.767 --> 04:11.200
he smokes like one.

04:11.202 --> 04:13.269
Bring him a cigar,
and you're gonna knock him dead.

04:13.271 --> 04:14.637
- You are amazing.
- No, you're amazing.

04:14.639 --> 04:15.671
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.673
Okay, me.

04:21.644 --> 04:22.945
Hank.

04:22.947 --> 04:26.782
You get any sleep?

04:26.784 --> 04:29.085
What have you decided
about my proposal?

04:29.087 --> 04:30.686
I understand you can't
tell me anything

04:30.688 --> 04:32.588
about the nature of your work.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.390
But you did mention that

04:34.392 --> 04:36.959
if I were to participate
in this... Venture,

04:36.961 --> 04:40.763
it would require a set of
strict, non-negotiable rules.

04:40.765 --> 04:43.566
These are necessary for your
protection, as well as my own.

04:43.568 --> 04:46.736
Okay.
What are they?

04:50.507 --> 04:53.009
Well...

04:57.047 --> 04:59.482
This is a pager watch.

04:59.484 --> 05:02.385
Operates on a secure frequency.

05:02.387 --> 05:04.954
Should I require you for
my personal medical needs,

05:04.956 --> 05:06.422
I'll call your cell phone.

05:06.424 --> 05:08.758
But the pager...

05:08.760 --> 05:11.027
Would strictly be
for the job at hand.

05:11.029 --> 05:12.228
And when it beeps?

05:12.230 --> 05:13.796
When it beeps, you would

05:13.798 --> 05:15.932
remove the SIM card
from your personal cell

05:15.934 --> 05:18.000
and proceed directly here,
to shadow pond.

05:18.002 --> 05:19.268
You will make no calls,

05:19.270 --> 05:20.670
you will send
no texts or emails.

05:20.672 --> 05:23.039
Your brother will be informed
that you would be

05:23.041 --> 05:25.808
temporarily unavailable.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.945
I suggest you prepare him
for your possible absence.

05:28.947 --> 05:31.380
While I can arrange for
other doctors to be on call,

05:31.382 --> 05:33.215
I can't guarantee
that when you page me

05:33.217 --> 05:34.583
I won't be with a patient.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.152
Such is the risk I would take.

05:36.154 --> 05:37.353
Hmm?

05:37.355 --> 05:38.988
Any questions?

05:38.990 --> 05:42.325
Probably none you would answer.

05:42.327 --> 05:43.793
Given the limited details,

05:43.795 --> 05:45.895
I'll understand
if you decline my offer.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.173
I'm in.

06:26.314 --> 06:28.248
Does Hank, uh,
often make beach calls?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.150
When necessary, yes.

06:30.152 --> 06:31.485
When Mr. Keegan called,
he said

06:31.487 --> 06:33.887
he was by the first
lifeguard station.

06:33.889 --> 06:35.356
Okay, now, Hank would
double-check that

06:35.358 --> 06:37.424
his bag was stocked with
medical supplies.

06:37.426 --> 06:39.293
As have I, twice.

06:39.295 --> 06:41.996
But, why didn't this gentleman
just go to the ER?

06:41.998 --> 06:43.630
Because he is
a retainer patient.

06:43.632 --> 06:46.867
They don't go.
We come.

06:46.869 --> 06:48.135
You know, it might be easier

06:48.137 --> 06:50.170
if you take off your shoes.
To walk.

06:50.172 --> 06:51.939
No. No, do you
have any idea

06:51.941 --> 06:54.341
what's underneath this sand?

06:54.343 --> 06:57.611
No. But I know that
Hank wouldn't complain.

07:02.584 --> 07:05.319
Here, over here!
Over here, here, here!

07:05.321 --> 07:06.887
It's my friend.

07:06.889 --> 07:08.489
Woody Keegan,
we are from Hankmed.

07:08.491 --> 07:10.758
I am Divya, and this is
Dr. Sacani.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.026
Oh, please, call me Jeremiah.

07:12.028 --> 07:13.560
How can I make you
feel better today?

07:13.562 --> 07:15.329
It's-- my hip.

07:15.331 --> 07:18.032
From what you told me,
it appears to be dislocated.

07:18.034 --> 07:21.235
We need to reduce it quickly.
His foot has no pulse.

07:21.237 --> 07:22.603
No pulse?
He could lose the foot.

07:22.605 --> 07:24.138
Dude, that's messed up.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.340
"Messed up" means serious,
right? Yes, it's very serious.

07:26.342 --> 07:28.142
Sir? Sir.

07:28.144 --> 07:30.044
Help me hold
his pelvis down, okay?

07:30.046 --> 07:31.311
We need to keep it
on the board.

07:31.313 --> 07:32.713
Woody, uh--

07:32.715 --> 07:34.048
I need to attempt
to reduce your hip.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.784
Here goes.

07:36.786 --> 07:39.186
Aah!

07:39.188 --> 07:41.755
Try again.

07:41.757 --> 07:44.324
Aah!

07:44.326 --> 07:46.326
I'll call Hank.

07:46.328 --> 07:48.162
I apologize for the discomfort.

07:48.164 --> 07:50.297
Just rest for a moment.

07:59.207 --> 08:01.942
I'll just be a minute.

08:10.652 --> 08:12.719
Hello.
I'm Dr. Tovo Kitihara.

08:12.721 --> 08:14.922
Today I'll present
an alternative method

08:14.924 --> 08:17.091
to a posterior hip dislocation.

08:17.093 --> 08:19.093
The East Baltimore lift.

08:19.095 --> 08:21.261
Each grab the other's shoulder.

08:21.263 --> 08:23.564
Extend the hip,
and rotate inward.

08:23.566 --> 08:25.232
Excuse me, friend of Woody's?

08:25.234 --> 08:27.334
Um, there's another surfer
a click down the beach.

08:27.336 --> 08:29.203
Will you call him over, please.

08:29.205 --> 08:31.772
Dude! Dude!
Over here, c'mere!

08:31.774 --> 08:33.807
When I lift it, with the other
hand reach under the leg

08:33.808 --> 08:35.775
and each grab
each other's shoulders.

08:35.778 --> 08:36.809
You understand?

08:36.812 --> 08:38.145
Reach under it.

08:38.147 --> 08:39.880
That's it, each grab
the other's shoulder.

08:39.881 --> 08:41.548
I'm gonna extend the hip
and rotate inward.

08:41.549 --> 08:44.284
Aah--

08:47.022 --> 08:48.789
And your pain
should be gone, yes?

08:48.791 --> 08:50.557
Yeah--
Yeah.

08:50.559 --> 08:54.027
Divya, will you
check his foot, please?

08:54.029 --> 08:56.029
His pulse has returned.

08:56.031 --> 08:58.398
Well, your foot and your hip
are going to be fine.

09:00.035 --> 09:02.136
Excellent work.

09:02.138 --> 09:04.505
I knew you had it in you.

09:17.152 --> 09:20.120
Evan?

09:20.122 --> 09:21.688
Oh, Henry.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.757
Hey, I'm glad you're here.
I need to discuss something.

09:23.759 --> 09:26.293
Oh, my God. Okay, uh--
I-I'm taking care of the boxes.

09:26.295 --> 09:27.861
No, it's not the boxes.

09:27.863 --> 09:29.129
Good, then I want to discuss
something with you first.

09:29.131 --> 09:30.931
It's really, really
important, okay?

09:30.933 --> 09:32.499
Striped or solid?

09:32.501 --> 09:33.834
Why?
Why does it matter?

09:33.836 --> 09:35.903
'Cause I am about to have
the meeting of my life.

09:35.905 --> 09:37.271
Of my life, Henry.

09:37.273 --> 09:41.308
I finally get to pitch
the services of Hankmed

09:41.310 --> 09:43.544
at the Blackstone.

09:43.546 --> 09:45.245
Which tie?

09:45.247 --> 09:47.080
You always choose the opposite
of what I choose.

09:47.082 --> 09:48.982
Maybe this time, I'll choose

09:48.984 --> 09:52.286
the opposite of what I think,
so you'll choose the other one.

09:52.288 --> 09:53.587
Okay, don't mess with
the system, Henry. It works.

09:53.589 --> 09:54.621
Which one?

09:54.623 --> 09:55.656
Fine.
The striped.

09:55.658 --> 09:56.757
Solid it is.

09:56.759 --> 09:59.560
Aw.

09:59.562 --> 10:00.561
Wait a second.
Did you just pick

10:00.563 --> 10:02.062
the tie you want me to wear,

10:02.064 --> 10:03.597
or the one
you don't want me to wear?

10:03.599 --> 10:04.998
Yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.401
Damn you.

10:07.403 --> 10:08.502
What the hell is that?

10:08.504 --> 10:09.970
Did you get a DUI?

10:09.972 --> 10:11.205
Are you under house arrest?

10:11.207 --> 10:13.006
No, I'm not under house arrest.

10:13.008 --> 10:14.708
Uh, it's a communications device
from Boris.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.742
What?

10:15.744 --> 10:16.910
I want one of those.

10:16.912 --> 10:18.378
You can't have one.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.047
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

10:20.049 --> 10:22.382
Boris may need me on short
notice in the near future,

10:22.384 --> 10:24.785
and I won't be able to reach you
after he calls.

10:24.787 --> 10:26.320
How will I even know
you're gone?

10:26.322 --> 10:27.788
Someone from shadow pond
will contact you,

10:27.790 --> 10:29.323
and I'll be unavailable.

10:29.325 --> 10:30.857
Just temporarily.

10:30.859 --> 10:32.459
You're w--

10:32.461 --> 10:34.027
Hold on. Wha--
I-is--

10:34.029 --> 10:36.830
Are you, w--
Ho, whoa. What?

10:36.832 --> 10:38.799
Is there something wrong
with Boris?

10:38.801 --> 10:40.968
Something's wrong with Boris.
Oh, my God.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.936
Henry, can you--
Ohh, of course.

10:42.938 --> 10:44.371
You can't say anything, right?

10:44.373 --> 10:45.706
Nope.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.441
Is Boris dying?

10:47.443 --> 10:48.508
Henry, is he dying?

10:48.510 --> 10:50.444
Blink twice if he's dying.

10:50.446 --> 10:52.813
The man of the hour returns.

10:52.815 --> 10:53.947
Uh, excuse me?

10:53.949 --> 10:55.082
I called on the way over

10:55.084 --> 10:57.317
to rave about
your impressive save.

10:57.319 --> 10:59.019
- Oh.
- Uh, the--

10:59.021 --> 11:00.320
Ah, what's it called again?

11:00.322 --> 11:02.356
It-- The--
The East Baltimore lift.

11:02.358 --> 11:04.057
It's a technique that, uh...

11:04.059 --> 11:05.759
Provides a more
controlled traction than

11:05.761 --> 11:08.662
other reducing maneuvers
for posterior hip dislocations.

11:08.664 --> 11:09.863
I haven't even heard of it.

11:09.865 --> 11:11.331
Yeah, me either.
Where'd you learn that?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.333
Eh, East Baltimore.

11:17.839 --> 11:19.906
- So, Divs.
- Yeah?

11:19.908 --> 11:21.141
Striped or solid?

11:21.143 --> 11:22.509
Don't ask me.

11:22.511 --> 11:23.910
Ask Hank,
then choose the opposite.

11:23.912 --> 11:25.345
I--

11:25.347 --> 11:27.781
- yeah.
- Okay. So, what...

11:27.783 --> 11:30.150
Is with all of these boxes?

11:30.152 --> 11:31.852
It's a lot of boxes, I know.
Divya--

11:31.854 --> 11:33.153
You screwed up didn't you?

11:33.155 --> 11:34.688
I'm taking care of it!
All right?

11:34.690 --> 11:35.756
All I wa--

11:35.758 --> 11:37.724
oh, my God.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.761
So...

11:40.763 --> 11:43.163
How's your mom?

11:43.165 --> 11:45.165
She left for London
this morning.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.367
Really? Wow.

11:47.369 --> 11:48.435
How's your dad?

11:48.437 --> 11:51.271
Not returning her calls.

11:51.273 --> 11:52.439
And he's alone.

11:52.441 --> 11:53.974
I'm a bit worried.

11:53.976 --> 11:55.509
Maybe you should
go check on him.

11:55.511 --> 11:58.979
You know, medically.

11:58.981 --> 12:00.981
Yeah.

12:07.288 --> 12:09.156
Hello?

12:09.158 --> 12:10.190
Hi.

12:10.192 --> 12:12.292
Um--
Wow.

12:12.294 --> 12:13.293
I'm looking for
Sidney Bartlett?

12:13.295 --> 12:15.829
Yes.
That's me.

12:15.831 --> 12:17.497
And you are?

12:17.499 --> 12:20.167
Ah-- Ah-- Evan R. Lawson,
CFO of Hankmed?

12:20.169 --> 12:21.868
Sorry if I messed up your game.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.204
Oh, doesn't take much,
believe me.

12:24.206 --> 12:25.839
It's nice to finally meet you.

12:25.841 --> 12:32.446
You too.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.581
You're talking about my father.

12:34.583 --> 12:35.949
- Ohh.
- I'm his daughter.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.384
Sydney with a "Y", not an "I".

12:37.386 --> 12:41.088
Okay. And so now you--
You have his job?

12:41.090 --> 12:42.155
Yes.

12:42.157 --> 12:43.190
Okay.

12:43.192 --> 12:44.624
Please, have a seat.

12:44.626 --> 12:47.994
Thank you.

12:47.996 --> 12:49.196
I wasn't implying, by the way,

12:49.198 --> 12:50.464
that being big, fat,
and jolly was bad.

12:50.466 --> 12:51.965
Go, Santa!

12:51.967 --> 12:54.434
Anyway, I heard that
your father likes cigars, so I--

12:54.436 --> 12:57.070
I brought him
a box of my favorites.

12:57.072 --> 13:01.241
He died two weeks ago.

13:01.243 --> 13:02.876
From emphysema.

13:02.878 --> 13:04.745
Oh, my God.

13:04.747 --> 13:06.246
I am so sorry.

13:06.248 --> 13:07.781
It's okay.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.625
Hi.
I'm Evan R. Lawson.

13:18.627 --> 13:21.161
I'm the CFO of Hankmed.

13:21.163 --> 13:23.964
Oh, Sydney Bartlett.
Sydney with a "Y", not an "I".

13:23.966 --> 13:25.632
- Huh.
- Have we met?

13:25.634 --> 13:27.367
I'm almost certain we haven't.

13:27.369 --> 13:29.236
It's--
It's really good to meet you.

13:29.238 --> 13:32.005
Nice to meet you too.

13:32.007 --> 13:33.340
I am so sorry.

13:33.342 --> 13:35.909
I had no idea sid died
when I was in england.

13:35.911 --> 13:37.744
It's okay.
Uh, I met with his daughter.

13:37.746 --> 13:39.045
Sydney.
With a "Y".

13:39.047 --> 13:40.280
- You met Sydney?
- Yeah.

13:40.282 --> 13:42.349
How'd it go?

13:42.351 --> 13:45.152
Interesting.
Initially, terrible.

13:45.154 --> 13:47.254
Like, the worst meeting
I've ever had in my life.

13:47.256 --> 13:49.122
But, uh...
I think I turned it around.

13:49.124 --> 13:50.390
- Good.
- Yeah.

13:50.392 --> 13:51.958
Oh. Syd-- That's--

13:51.960 --> 13:53.460
Sydney?

13:53.462 --> 13:54.795
It's me, Paige.

13:54.797 --> 13:56.530
Paige Collins.

13:56.532 --> 13:58.498
Paige!
Oh, it's been a while.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.233
I hardly recognize you.

14:00.235 --> 14:02.302
I know, I hardly recognized
you either.

14:02.304 --> 14:04.571
Miss Bartlett?
Can we talk to you?

14:04.573 --> 14:06.072
Yeah, of course.

14:06.074 --> 14:07.507
I have to go.
It's so good to see you.

14:07.509 --> 14:08.575
Please tell your parents
I said hello.

14:08.577 --> 14:09.709
- I will.
- Okay.

14:09.711 --> 14:10.977
I really-- I--

14:10.979 --> 14:12.512
wow.

14:12.514 --> 14:15.348
Guess I didn't make as much of
an impression as I thought.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.350
Hello.
How can I help you?

14:17.352 --> 14:20.253
- It seems you double-booked
our court time.

14:20.255 --> 14:22.189
We have a lesson
on court seven today.

14:22.191 --> 14:23.690
But, we have a lesson
on that court.

14:23.692 --> 14:26.626
But don't you remember,
we spoke after lunch yesterday.

14:26.628 --> 14:28.829
But Miss Bartlett and I
spoke yesterday morning.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.797
Any chance you all
might want to play together?

14:30.799 --> 14:32.065
Is this about court seven?

14:32.067 --> 14:33.934
Yes.
And it's already booked.

14:33.936 --> 14:35.168
I know, by us.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.369
But our instructor isn't there,

14:36.371 --> 14:38.438
and we arranged for a lesson
this morning?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.106
Don't you remember,
miss Bartlett?

14:40.108 --> 14:42.275
- I'd really like to play today.
- It helps calm her nerves.

14:42.277 --> 14:44.344
Did I mention we've been
members for over 15 years?

14:44.346 --> 14:45.879
We've been members for over 20.

14:45.881 --> 14:47.714
Now, Sydney, I know you've
been through a lot lately--

14:47.716 --> 14:49.883
It's the only exercise
I'll have all week!

14:49.885 --> 14:51.685
I-- You-- Yeah, I'm going to
go check the schedule.

14:51.687 --> 14:53.687
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

15:07.595 --> 15:08.795
Are you sure about the jacket?

15:08.797 --> 15:09.996
Yes. It's a country club.

15:09.998 --> 15:11.231
There's a dress code.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.466
I don't know,
it just feels desperate.

15:12.468 --> 15:14.201
You're lucky I'm not
making you wear a tie.

15:14.203 --> 15:16.002
Would it be striped or solid?

15:16.004 --> 15:18.538
Hey, it's not my fault you
couldn't close this deal.

15:18.540 --> 15:19.673
I will ignore
your snarky comment.

15:19.675 --> 15:21.608
But, speaking of closing,

15:21.610 --> 15:22.743
when do you
bring out the contract?

15:22.745 --> 15:24.010
After Sydney says yes.

15:24.012 --> 15:25.712
No, you--
No, no. Listen to me.

15:25.714 --> 15:27.748
You don't wait for her
to actually say yes.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.984
You pounce the moment you smell
even a hint of "maybe".

15:30.986 --> 15:32.018
Are you listening to me?

15:32.020 --> 15:33.987
Uh--

15:33.989 --> 15:35.622
Oh, my God.

15:35.624 --> 15:38.558
Boris looks terrible.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.594
Is he losing weight?

15:40.596 --> 15:42.095
Brothers Lawson.

15:42.097 --> 15:43.997
Boris.

15:43.999 --> 15:45.065
Good morning, Boris.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.333
Good morning.

15:46.335 --> 15:48.969
No, really, I-I just--
I wanted to say

15:48.971 --> 15:50.570
good morning.

15:50.572 --> 15:52.139
'Cause every new morning...

15:52.141 --> 15:53.940
Is a good one.

15:53.942 --> 15:56.009
Especially this one.

15:56.011 --> 15:57.177
- Evan, I think--
- And, you know,

15:57.179 --> 15:58.645
I am-- I--
I just wanted to say,

15:58.647 --> 16:02.149
I'm so grateful for the
generosity you've shown Hankmed.

16:02.151 --> 16:05.152
You've given us so much,
um--

16:05.154 --> 16:07.087
We could never repay it.

16:07.089 --> 16:08.255
Well, I thank you.

16:08.257 --> 16:10.624
I-- Thank you. Really.

16:10.626 --> 16:13.460
It's been an honor...

16:13.462 --> 16:14.828
Not getting to know you.

16:14.830 --> 16:15.896
I--

16:15.898 --> 16:17.731
no.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.500
I am so sorry.

16:25.373 --> 16:28.842
Good.
Yeah.

16:28.844 --> 16:30.210
So...

16:36.017 --> 16:38.351
Hello, father.

16:38.353 --> 16:41.621
I know that sometimes
when you are in distress,

16:41.623 --> 16:45.625
you can be forgetful about
taking your medications.

16:45.627 --> 16:48.995
Perhaps I could just...
check your blood pressure?

16:57.038 --> 16:58.638
Your blood pressure's fine.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.640
It's nice to see you, father.

17:00.642 --> 17:02.943
Your roses look fantastic.

17:02.945 --> 17:04.377
I had them cut
earlier this year.

17:04.378 --> 17:06.179
It's an experiment.

17:06.181 --> 17:07.414
Well, it paid off.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.415
I've never seen them
looking any better.

17:09.417 --> 17:10.884
Here's the estimate,
Mr. Katdare.

17:10.886 --> 17:12.352
- My crew can start next week.
- Excellent.

17:12.354 --> 17:14.887
I'll be in touch.

17:14.890 --> 17:16.122
What are you having done?

17:16.124 --> 17:19.693
I'm having the pool drained
and paved over.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.862
Uh, but, mother loves the pool.

17:21.864 --> 17:23.463
She swims every day.

17:23.464 --> 17:25.999
Well, I can't swim,
and she's not here.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.302
Father,
I know that you are hurt.

17:29.304 --> 17:31.404
But, please,
don't make things worse.

17:31.406 --> 17:33.540
Your mother started this,
not me.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.042
And if she thinks she's going
to have continued say

17:36.044 --> 17:40.914
over this property,
she's quite wrong.

17:40.916 --> 17:42.349
Father, mother wants
to talk to you

17:42.351 --> 17:43.717
and tell you how she feels.

17:43.719 --> 17:44.818
If you would just call her--

17:44.820 --> 17:46.786
I don't care how she feels.

17:46.788 --> 17:48.288
She has said enough
with her actions,

17:48.290 --> 17:51.458
and now she will
reap the results.

17:52.894 --> 17:55.595
Mother left you because
you are impossible.

17:55.597 --> 17:58.031
You won't discuss anything!

17:58.033 --> 18:00.934
You just throw up these commands
like walls around you--

18:00.936 --> 18:02.602
- You have no right to get in--
- I am not finished!

18:02.604 --> 18:07.340
For once, you're going to
hear what I have to say.

18:07.342 --> 18:09.910
You shut me out.

18:09.912 --> 18:12.345
You cut me off.

18:12.347 --> 18:14.948
And now you're
doing the same thing to mother.

18:14.950 --> 18:17.350
Well, if you don't
start changing,

18:17.352 --> 18:19.486
if you don't stop this behavior,

18:19.488 --> 18:24.357
you are going to end up
unloved and alone.

18:24.359 --> 18:27.193
Then I guess
there is no hope for me.

18:37.638 --> 18:38.905
So nice to meet you, Hank.

18:38.907 --> 18:41.875
It's nice to meet you too,
Sydney.

18:41.877 --> 18:43.376
I'd like to first
offer my condolences

18:43.378 --> 18:44.911
for the loss of your father.

18:44.913 --> 18:47.113
I know how hard it is
to lose a parent.

18:47.115 --> 18:50.050
Thank you.
It is hard.

18:50.052 --> 18:51.484
He meant so much to me.

18:51.486 --> 18:53.420
I had no idea
what I was getting into

18:53.422 --> 18:55.322
when I took over this job.

18:55.324 --> 18:59.693
My father always made it
look so easy. But...

18:59.695 --> 19:01.194
Me, I'm overwhelmed.

19:01.196 --> 19:02.696
Well, don't be so
hard on yourself.

19:02.698 --> 19:04.998
I mean, you're still fresh
to the grieving process.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.766
It isn't just grief.

19:06.768 --> 19:09.069
I didn't... make it

19:09.071 --> 19:12.539
to the hospital.
In time.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.040
I never got to say good-bye.

19:14.042 --> 19:17.177
Sydney, remorse is
a normal part of loss.

19:17.179 --> 19:20.146
But it can also
produce anxiety.

19:20.148 --> 19:22.616
My father ran this club
my whole life.

19:22.618 --> 19:23.650
I want to do a good job.

19:23.652 --> 19:25.585
I ha-- I have to
do a good job.

19:25.587 --> 19:27.120
- You are.
- Sydney!

19:27.122 --> 19:29.456
We have a special request for
tonight's dinner reservation.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.024
Oh, sure.

19:31.026 --> 19:32.726
Oh, um... Is this private?
Should we come back later?

19:32.728 --> 19:34.194
No, no, it's fine.

19:34.196 --> 19:36.463
Allow me to introduce
Dr. Hank Lawson.

19:36.465 --> 19:37.731
Please, call me Hank.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.032
- Roger Stark. Good to meet you.
- You too.

19:39.034 --> 19:41.768
Yes.
I've been telling Hank about

19:41.770 --> 19:44.037
our club's loyal members,

19:44.039 --> 19:45.905
and none are more important
than Roger Stark

19:45.907 --> 19:47.774
and his daughter, Colette.

19:47.776 --> 19:50.276
My name is Summer.

19:50.278 --> 19:53.947
And I'm not his daughter,
I'm his wife.

19:53.949 --> 19:55.715
Of course.

19:55.717 --> 19:57.183
Please, forgive me.

19:57.185 --> 19:59.152
She snubbed me at the pool
yesterday, and now this.

19:59.154 --> 20:03.289
Fix it, Roger.

20:04.558 --> 20:06.359
Uh, sweetheart?
Please...

20:06.361 --> 20:07.894
She has a lot on her plate.

20:07.896 --> 20:09.262
I'm sorry, I have to
go deal with this.

20:09.264 --> 20:11.464
I'll, uh--
I'll stop by later to follow up.

20:11.466 --> 20:12.999
Oh, yes, yes, and I'll--
I'll make sure

20:13.001 --> 20:14.267
our meeting isn't interrupted.

20:14.269 --> 20:15.902
Oh-- No, not for business.

20:15.904 --> 20:18.238
For you.

20:22.910 --> 20:24.778
They said
you were a supervisor.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.513
Well, I've spoken to three--
Oh my God, can y--

20:26.515 --> 20:28.515
Okay--
Hello?

20:31.218 --> 20:32.318
Hey.
Hey.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.353
How'd it go?

20:33.355 --> 20:34.387
Yeah, I think it went pretty--

20:34.389 --> 20:36.189
I mean, I think she was...

20:36.191 --> 20:37.657
She didn't sign the contract,
did she?

20:37.659 --> 20:39.025
Our meeting was cut short.

20:39.027 --> 20:40.694
All right, um,
how did she respond

20:40.696 --> 20:42.595
to our patient care
philosophy statement?

20:42.597 --> 20:44.531
We were interrupted
before I could get into it.

20:44.533 --> 20:46.499
Henry, you remembered
to have Sydney

20:46.501 --> 20:48.001
read the staff profiles, right?

20:48.003 --> 20:49.502
Honestly, Evan, she seemed
a bit preoccu--

20:49.504 --> 20:50.837
You forgot the staff profiles.

20:50.839 --> 20:52.605
Henr--

20:52.607 --> 20:54.207
Okay.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.642
As if I don't have
enough to do.

20:55.644 --> 20:57.477
It was Roger Stark
and his daughter.

20:57.479 --> 20:59.979
It-- was his wife.
It's his wife.

21:10.157 --> 21:11.691
Oh!

21:16.832 --> 21:18.064
Ms. Bartlett?

21:18.066 --> 21:20.366
Uh, I'm so sorry to bother you.

21:20.368 --> 21:22.435
It seems my brother
f--

21:27.115 --> 21:28.449
Don't worry, Sydney,
I called my brother.

21:28.451 --> 21:29.717
Hang tight.

21:29.719 --> 21:30.918
Oh, that's a lot of blood--
Okay.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.386
All right,
I'm gonna help you up.

21:32.388 --> 21:34.355
Don't move, don't move.
You're surrounded by glass.

21:34.357 --> 21:36.290
So I'm gonna guide you back...

21:36.292 --> 21:37.325
Great.

21:37.327 --> 21:38.659
Let's just move way back...

21:38.661 --> 21:40.494
Away from the glass.

21:40.496 --> 21:42.229
And, your nose is bleeding.

21:42.231 --> 21:43.931
So, I'm just gonna--
Gonna give you something

21:43.933 --> 21:45.299
to stop the bleeding, okay?

21:45.301 --> 21:47.835
Here ya go.
I'm gonna put this on your nose,

21:47.837 --> 21:48.869
- put some pressure--
- Ow.

21:48.871 --> 21:49.904
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

21:49.906 --> 21:51.672
Okay...
What happened?

21:51.674 --> 21:53.274
I j--
Got startled,

21:53.276 --> 21:54.875
- and I-I tripped--
- Don't put your head back.

21:54.877 --> 21:56.077
Just keep your head
above your heart.

21:56.079 --> 21:58.412
- Oh-kay, still bleeding.
- Ugh.

21:58.414 --> 21:59.847
Um...

21:59.849 --> 22:01.749
- Stay right there.
- Yeah.

22:01.751 --> 22:02.883
Just gonna put this
under your chin

22:02.885 --> 22:03.918
to catch the blood.

22:05.755 --> 22:08.456
I got a lot of nosebleeds
as a kid, so...

22:08.458 --> 22:10.124
I ruined a lot of shirts,
actually.

22:10.126 --> 22:12.326
I'm lucky you were here.

22:12.328 --> 22:14.028
I knew when I met you
I could trust you.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.663
Wow, thank you.

22:15.665 --> 22:18.366
I don't know what's going on
with me-- I'm so accident-prone.

22:18.368 --> 22:20.334
I got into a car accident
on the way to see my father

22:20.336 --> 22:22.770
to say good-bye, and then I
fell down the stairs yesterday,

22:22.772 --> 22:24.839
and then this happened.
I--

22:24.841 --> 22:26.307
You might be right.

22:26.309 --> 22:27.808
- I-I'm right about what?
- Maybe I'm--

22:27.810 --> 22:29.110
I'm anxious.

22:29.112 --> 22:30.311
Uh-huh?

22:30.313 --> 22:32.980
Like, what would you
prescribe for me?

22:32.982 --> 22:33.981
Do you think I'm Hank?

22:33.983 --> 22:35.116
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.350
EMTs are on their way.

22:36.352 --> 22:37.952
Oh, my God,
this is so embarrassing.

22:37.954 --> 22:39.286
I fell,
and then I just--

22:39.288 --> 22:41.088
For a second
I thought Evan was you.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.024
- I don't know.
- We're gonna figure this out.

22:43.026 --> 22:44.759
- Just give me that.
- All right, let me take a look.

22:44.761 --> 22:46.894
Open your mouth, please?

22:46.896 --> 22:49.130
Yeah, Ev, get some water.
She has a posterior bleed.

22:49.132 --> 22:50.398
It'll help clear her throat.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.766
You had me at "get".
Hold on to this.

22:51.768 --> 22:53.834
Okay--
Okay.

22:53.836 --> 22:56.937
This may pinch a little.

22:56.939 --> 22:57.972
- Okay.
- Ow.

22:57.974 --> 23:00.207
I need to stop the bleeding.

23:02.544 --> 23:05.079
- Water.
- Yeah. Give her some water.

23:05.081 --> 23:07.448
Sydney, you can spit it out
into the bowl.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.116
- Eww.
- Oh, my God.

23:09.118 --> 23:11.185
It's all right. I'm gonna stop
the bleeding, don't you worry.

23:11.187 --> 23:13.354
This will anesthetize
your nose.

23:13.356 --> 23:15.823
Okay, okay.

23:15.825 --> 23:17.958
- Little squirt.
- Sydney,

23:17.960 --> 23:19.326
this is going to be
very uncomfortable.

23:19.328 --> 23:23.164
Sorry.

23:23.166 --> 23:26.667
- Ow. Ow.
- Yeah. I know.

23:26.669 --> 23:28.836
- Okay, it's in.
- Can I hold it here?

23:28.838 --> 23:30.104
Yeah, just don't pull it out.

23:30.106 --> 23:33.007
Don't pull it out.
It's not so bad, right?

23:33.009 --> 23:34.575
Okay, now I'm going to
inflate the balloons.

23:34.577 --> 23:35.910
You're going to feel
some pressure.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.581
Let me just make sure
it inflated.

23:40.583 --> 23:41.982
- Oh!
- Okay, good.

23:41.984 --> 23:44.952
And, now you're going to feel
some more pressure.

23:44.954 --> 23:46.020
Ow.

23:46.022 --> 23:47.521
Great.
Now just lean your head back.

23:47.523 --> 23:49.090
Open.
Ahh.

23:49.092 --> 23:50.491
Good.
It stopped the bleeding.

23:50.493 --> 23:52.026
Ohh...

23:52.028 --> 23:54.929
That's great, you did great.
Now what?

23:54.931 --> 23:57.431
Her nose is broken.
I need to make a splint.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.366
- It's broken?
- Rip me a piece of tape.

23:59.368 --> 24:00.601
Broke my nose?

24:00.603 --> 24:02.069
I broke my nose
as a kid, it's fine.

24:02.071 --> 24:04.138
Look at my nose, it's fine.
It's a little crooked.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.341
Good. This should
stabilize your nose.

24:07.343 --> 24:09.076
Okay, tape please?

24:09.078 --> 24:11.212
Thank you.

24:11.214 --> 24:12.913
Okay.

24:12.915 --> 24:14.782
- Hey, doc, we're here.
- Hey, guys.

24:14.784 --> 24:16.784
Oh, no.
You guys, I'm fine.

24:16.786 --> 24:19.320
I'm so sorry.
I'm totally fine.

24:23.359 --> 24:25.359
I'll go to the hospital
with her.

24:25.361 --> 24:26.360
Henry, we'll be fine.

24:26.362 --> 24:28.162
- Seriously, go.
- Okay.

24:28.164 --> 24:30.498
You're in good hands.

24:42.911 --> 24:45.446
Hello.
I'm Divya Katdare.

24:45.448 --> 24:47.548
Ah, yes.
Right this way.

24:55.891 --> 24:57.491
- Divya?
- Jim.

24:57.493 --> 24:59.126
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

24:59.128 --> 25:01.462
You too. Veronica's said
a lot of great things about you.

25:01.464 --> 25:02.596
About you as well.

25:05.067 --> 25:08.702
Thank you.

25:08.704 --> 25:09.904
I'm just sorry that my name

25:09.906 --> 25:12.139
isn't as interesting
as yours is.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.642
Well, I can only hope that
our meal and our conversation

25:14.644 --> 25:16.510
will make up for that.

25:16.512 --> 25:17.945
Okay. So, should we avoid

25:17.947 --> 25:19.847
the boring
"what do you do for a living?"

25:19.849 --> 25:21.215
It is boring, isn't it?

25:21.217 --> 25:23.651
I mean, why let our jobs
invade our social life?

25:23.653 --> 25:25.186
You have no idea.

25:25.188 --> 25:27.822
So...
What shall we talk about?

25:27.824 --> 25:30.124
Well, how about what we do
when we're not working?

25:30.126 --> 25:33.327
I love that idea.
But you go first.

25:33.329 --> 25:35.129
Okay.
Well, I used to be a runner,

25:35.131 --> 25:38.999
but it got hard on my knees,
so now I'm big into swimming.

25:39.001 --> 25:40.668
- Swimming.
- Pool mostly.

25:40.670 --> 25:41.969
But I'm thinking of
going ocean.

25:41.971 --> 25:43.037
I hear it's a whole different
workout, so...

25:43.039 --> 25:44.171
Yes. Plus, no one's going to

25:44.173 --> 25:46.507
fill the ocean with cement.

25:46.509 --> 25:48.108
I hope not.

25:48.110 --> 25:51.512
That would certainly affect
more than just my swimming.

25:51.514 --> 25:53.480
I am so sorry.
I should explain.

25:53.482 --> 25:55.182
No, no, no, it's fine.
You don't have to--

25:55.184 --> 25:56.784
My mother
recently left my father.

25:56.786 --> 26:00.154
I inadvertently
inspired her to leave him.

26:00.156 --> 26:02.957
Yep, and then
I invited her into my home.

26:02.959 --> 26:04.458
I wanted to check in on him.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.360
You know, to make sure
that he was okay.

26:06.362 --> 26:09.396
I-I talked about roses.

26:09.398 --> 26:13.901
What could possibly go wrong
with a chat about roses?

26:13.903 --> 26:15.469
Right?

26:15.471 --> 26:16.904
Plenty!

26:18.673 --> 26:20.241
He wants the pool drained.

26:20.243 --> 26:22.977
I mean, who does that?
Certainly a person

26:22.979 --> 26:25.813
who would force his daughter
into an arranged marriage.

26:25.815 --> 26:27.681
I wanted a calm
and rational conversation.

26:27.683 --> 26:29.316
You know, calm and rational,
because that is what I am.

26:29.318 --> 26:30.751
I am calm
and I am rational, right?

26:30.753 --> 26:32.686
I mean, you'd accept an apology
from me, right?!

26:36.958 --> 26:39.293
If I had known that
swimming was a touchy subject,

26:39.295 --> 26:41.495
I would have started off with
"what do you do for a living?"

26:44.567 --> 26:46.800
So what do you do for a living?

26:46.802 --> 26:48.836
I'm a family therapist.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.846
Okay.
What do I need to do?

26:58.848 --> 27:03.684
I regret to tell you that
plans changed after I paged you.

27:03.686 --> 27:06.053
S-so,
you don't need me.

27:06.055 --> 27:08.188
Not at the moment, no.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.356
However,

27:09.358 --> 27:11.792
since you're here,

27:11.794 --> 27:14.628
you need to sign this
non-disclosure agreement,

27:14.630 --> 27:16.664
a liability release.

27:16.666 --> 27:17.731
Do you have a will, Hank?

27:17.733 --> 27:18.933
I do.

27:18.935 --> 27:20.501
Why?

27:20.503 --> 27:24.805
Stepping into my world
brings with it certain...

27:24.807 --> 27:26.807
Risks.

27:30.879 --> 27:32.179
Anything else?

27:32.181 --> 27:33.514
Yah.

27:33.516 --> 27:35.215
You walked the entire length
of the Blackstone Club

27:35.217 --> 27:39.153
before you removed your SIM
and disabled your phone.

27:39.155 --> 27:41.155
Don't wait so long again.

27:55.904 --> 27:57.104
Father,

27:57.106 --> 27:58.305
look.

27:58.307 --> 28:00.774
I'm calling to apologize.

28:00.776 --> 28:02.843
I know you're in there.

28:02.845 --> 28:04.979
Please.

28:15.690 --> 28:16.890
Yes.

28:16.892 --> 28:20.427
I need an ambulance
at 2711 Sea View Drive.

28:57.165 --> 29:00.634
Breathe!

29:00.636 --> 29:02.369
Wake up, daddy.
Wake up.

29:02.371 --> 29:04.772
Please!
Wake up!

29:14.215 --> 29:15.282
Okay, come on.

29:15.284 --> 29:16.350
What are the chances

29:16.352 --> 29:17.951
of me running into you here?

29:17.953 --> 29:21.722
You're a doctor, I'm a doctor.
This is a hospital, so...

29:21.724 --> 29:22.856
I'd say pretty good.

29:22.858 --> 29:24.491
All right, good point.

29:24.493 --> 29:26.193
What kind of medicine
do you practice?

29:26.195 --> 29:29.296
Pediatrics. I'm here to
check in on a newborn.

29:29.298 --> 29:31.565
What about you?
What's your background?

29:31.567 --> 29:32.833
I worked in a Brooklyn ER,

29:32.835 --> 29:34.435
and now I'm in
concierge medicine.

29:34.437 --> 29:37.037
Hmm, maybe adrenaline junkies
do change.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.605
Have dinner with me
and find out.

29:38.607 --> 29:40.207
You know I can't do that.

29:40.209 --> 29:42.109
Yeah, but I don't know <i>why</i>
<i>you won't date a doctor.</i>

29:42.111 --> 29:44.745
They're workaholics,
not socially dependable,

29:44.747 --> 29:46.280
their divorce rate is terrible,

29:46.282 --> 29:48.982
and don't even get me started
on their God complex.

29:48.984 --> 29:52.653
That's all?
I thought you liked a challenge.

29:52.655 --> 29:54.488
I'm tired of making
bad choices.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.423
I want to learn
from my mistakes.

29:56.425 --> 29:59.026
So do I, so do I.
But... Look,

29:59.028 --> 30:02.329
if you're telling me
you don't feel like...

30:02.331 --> 30:04.531
- There might be something here?
- Yeah.

30:04.533 --> 30:05.766
Maybe.

30:05.768 --> 30:07.101
Then live a little.

30:07.103 --> 30:11.872
Break one of your rules.

30:11.874 --> 30:13.941
The blue door.
Friday night, 7:00.

30:13.943 --> 30:15.576
I'll meet you there.

30:15.578 --> 30:18.312
And this is why I got
suspended in high school.

30:18.314 --> 30:21.715
I couldn't follow the rules.

30:23.384 --> 30:24.852
- Hey.
- There you are.

30:24.854 --> 30:26.353
What's the, uh--
What's the update on Sydney?

30:26.355 --> 30:27.888
Non-displaced fracture.

30:27.890 --> 30:29.123
They're splinting and re-packing
her nose right now,

30:29.125 --> 30:31.458
but it should heal up just fine.
And I'm you.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.227
Um, how's uh, BKJBR?

30:33.229 --> 30:35.362
Or is it BBKJR?

30:35.364 --> 30:36.697
BBJKR?

30:36.699 --> 30:37.931
What the hell is it?
BB--

30:37.933 --> 30:39.933
Calm down.
Everything's a-ok.

30:39.935 --> 30:41.935
- Really? Good.
- Coming through!

30:45.173 --> 30:46.707
That guy looks just like
Divya's dad.

30:46.709 --> 30:48.342
Yeah, it does.

30:49.544 --> 30:51.411
Divya?

30:51.413 --> 30:53.413
Divya.

31:10.619 --> 31:11.919
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:11.921 --> 31:13.087
How's your dad?

31:13.089 --> 31:15.690
He's still comatose.

31:15.692 --> 31:16.857
The good news is

31:16.859 --> 31:18.159
that his pupils, reflexes,

31:18.161 --> 31:20.494
and respiratory responses
are all normal,

31:20.496 --> 31:23.064
and the EKG
ruled out a heart attack.

31:23.066 --> 31:25.299
- That's good.
- Yeah.

31:25.301 --> 31:28.202
He needs tox screens
and more tests.

31:28.204 --> 31:30.171
CT is being prepped,
and, uh--

31:30.173 --> 31:33.074
- And neuro is on the way.
- Okay.

31:33.076 --> 31:37.812
I actually understood
most of that.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.113
How are you?

31:42.284 --> 31:43.784
I'm not sure.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.597
Why don't you just

31:56.599 --> 31:58.432
tell me what to do
to have these boxes returned.

31:58.434 --> 31:59.667
No, Divya, I'm--

31:59.669 --> 32:02.136
Just d-- Dkay. No,
d-d-don't transfer me.

32:02.138 --> 32:03.170
Don't tra--

32:03.172 --> 32:04.605
Listen to me.
Stay with your father,

32:04.607 --> 32:06.841
and just let us know
if anything changes, okay?

32:06.843 --> 32:08.509
Okay, bye.

32:08.511 --> 32:12.747
So, you'll have to take calls
without Divya today.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.284
Are you okay?

32:17.286 --> 32:20.254
I was not, in fact,
previously familiar with

32:20.256 --> 32:22.156
the east Baltimore lift.

32:22.158 --> 32:24.291
I found the technique
on the Internet.

32:24.293 --> 32:26.093
I cheated.

32:26.095 --> 32:28.996
I know that's not
the Hankmed way.

32:28.998 --> 32:31.132
I admire you, Hank, and I'm--

32:31.134 --> 32:33.534
I'm extremely
disappointed in myself

32:33.536 --> 32:38.072
that I've let you down.

32:38.074 --> 32:41.442
Your career's been
focused on research, right?

32:41.444 --> 32:44.145
And you played to that strength
to help a patient in need.

32:44.147 --> 32:46.347
That is definitely
the Hankmed way.

32:46.349 --> 32:50.618
You didn't disappoint anyone.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.520
So you're--
You're not going to fire me?

32:52.522 --> 32:54.255
Fire you?

32:54.257 --> 32:55.589
Are you kidding?

32:55.591 --> 32:57.458
Jeremiah...

32:57.460 --> 33:00.027
We're lucky to have you.

33:00.029 --> 33:02.163
Um, thank you.
Thank you very much.

33:02.165 --> 33:07.068
I will go see
Divya's patients now.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.336
Hey.

33:09.338 --> 33:12.339
They're your patients too.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.146
Hey, Dr. Sacani.

33:19.148 --> 33:20.514
Please, call me Jeremiah.

33:20.516 --> 33:21.982
How can I make you
feel better today?

33:21.984 --> 33:23.517
All good.

33:23.519 --> 33:25.920
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:25.922 --> 33:27.988
Weirdest thing just happened.

33:27.990 --> 33:30.491
I was at the club for yoga, and

33:30.493 --> 33:32.393
I ran into Sydney.

33:32.395 --> 33:33.761
She didn't recognize me.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.563
Had no idea who I was.

33:35.565 --> 33:37.098
Yeah, don't take that
personally.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.499
Yesterday she thought
I was Hank.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.101
Wait. She didn't
recognize either of you?

33:40.103 --> 33:41.302
Well, she had just

33:41.304 --> 33:42.737
smashed through a glass table
with her face.

33:42.739 --> 33:45.005
So, between that
and her car accident--

33:45.007 --> 33:47.975
What car accident?

33:47.977 --> 33:49.610
She was in a car accident

33:49.612 --> 33:51.445
on the way to visit her dad
in the hospital.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.914
That's why she
wasn't there when he died.

33:53.916 --> 33:56.584
No wonder Sydney's distracted.

33:56.586 --> 33:57.752
She's heartbroken.

33:57.754 --> 33:59.754
I think it's more than grief.

34:02.224 --> 34:03.491
Ms. Bartlett?

34:03.493 --> 34:04.492
Yes.

34:07.829 --> 34:10.598
How can I help you?

34:10.600 --> 34:12.166
Do you recognize us?

34:12.168 --> 34:13.768
Yes.

34:13.770 --> 34:18.239
And-- and I
so value your membership.

34:18.241 --> 34:19.373
We're not club members.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.007
It's me, Hank,

34:21.010 --> 34:23.577
and my brother Evan.

34:23.579 --> 34:25.612
I'm so sorry.

34:25.614 --> 34:26.813
No, no, no, no.
We're not here

34:26.815 --> 34:28.882
to make you feel bad.
We-- We want to help.

34:28.885 --> 34:30.818
We think you have
a medical condition.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.420
Sydney,
what caused you to fall?

34:33.422 --> 34:35.156
Oh, I--
I passed by the mirror

34:35.158 --> 34:36.891
and got startled. I thought
someone was in my office.

34:36.893 --> 34:38.492
Okay.

34:38.494 --> 34:39.493
Um--

34:39.495 --> 34:42.295
Come with me for a sec?

34:48.536 --> 34:50.237
Evan, stand over here.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.237
Here?

34:51.239 --> 34:52.540
Yeah.

34:52.542 --> 34:53.974
Okay,

34:53.976 --> 34:58.078
look into the mirror
and tell me what you see.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.315
Why don't I recognize
my own face?

35:01.317 --> 35:04.652
It may not just be your own
face you don't recognize.

35:04.654 --> 35:08.122
When you look at me and Evan,
what do you see?

35:11.059 --> 35:12.526
I see your faces,

35:12.528 --> 35:13.828
but,

35:13.830 --> 35:15.963
they look... the same.

35:15.965 --> 35:18.165
Which is why I can't tell
the two of you apart.

35:20.635 --> 35:22.036
What's wrong with me?

35:22.038 --> 35:25.339
I think the part of your brain
responsible for processing faces

35:25.341 --> 35:26.941
has somehow been impaired.

35:26.943 --> 35:29.310
Did you hit your head
in the car accident?

35:29.312 --> 35:30.578
Well, I didn't think so,

35:30.580 --> 35:32.046
but the paramedics
said that I lost consciousness

35:32.048 --> 35:33.447
and they took me
to the hospital,

35:33.449 --> 35:35.282
but I left before
any of the tests were run.

35:35.284 --> 35:38.085
I felt fine, and I was
anxious to see my father.

35:38.087 --> 35:40.154
A neurologist
will confirm this, but

35:40.156 --> 35:43.190
I believe you did suffer a head
trauma in the car accident

35:43.192 --> 35:46.026
and it caused a condition
called prosopagnosia.

35:46.028 --> 35:48.796
Otherwise known as
face blindness.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.297
You can see people's faces,

35:50.299 --> 35:52.867
but the features lack any
distinguishing details.

35:52.869 --> 35:54.702
It's why you can't
tell people apart.

35:56.005 --> 35:58.372
I thought I was going crazy.

36:01.309 --> 36:02.810
Well, how soon
can I see a neurologist?

36:02.812 --> 36:04.311
Very soon.

36:20.629 --> 36:21.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:28.470 --> 36:30.571
Any change?

36:30.573 --> 36:32.940
No.

36:32.942 --> 36:35.276
The MRI showed minimal shearing

36:35.278 --> 36:37.111
without a large bleed.

36:37.113 --> 36:40.080
And on the Glasgow coma scale,
he's a nine.

36:40.082 --> 36:41.982
Okay, okay,
those are good signs.

36:41.984 --> 36:45.185
He's been unconscious for
more than 12 hours, Hank.

36:45.187 --> 36:46.520
That's not a good sign.

36:46.522 --> 36:48.255
The 12-hour rule
is not hard and fast,

36:48.257 --> 36:49.723
you know that.

36:49.725 --> 36:54.595
What matters here is that
you found him quickly.

36:54.597 --> 36:58.432
Hank, I don't think
that he fell.

36:58.434 --> 37:01.101
My father's bruises
aren't consistent with

37:01.103 --> 37:03.704
a pool-side fall.

37:03.706 --> 37:05.072
The neurologist thinks that

37:05.074 --> 37:07.775
he must have hit
the water from a very

37:07.777 --> 37:11.445
h-high point...

37:11.447 --> 37:14.715
Which would explain his coma.

37:14.717 --> 37:16.450
So you think--

37:16.452 --> 37:18.585
I went to see him.

37:18.587 --> 37:20.788
We had a fight.

37:24.526 --> 37:28.529
And I told him that
there was no hope for him.

37:31.132 --> 37:33.734
This is all my fault.

37:33.736 --> 37:34.768
Divya.

37:38.541 --> 37:39.907
It's okay.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.836
Looks like you did
suffer a concussion

37:44.838 --> 37:46.838
in the car accident.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.107
There's swelling in your right
temporal lobe.

37:49.109 --> 37:51.109
This functional mri shows

37:51.111 --> 37:53.177
what a normal brain scan
should look like,

37:53.179 --> 37:55.913
here's the FMRI of your brain.

37:55.915 --> 37:57.915
See, it's this reversal
that's likely causing

37:57.917 --> 37:59.384
the face blindness.

37:59.386 --> 38:01.619
But, as the swelling
in your brain goes down,

38:01.621 --> 38:03.221
your facial recognition
should return.

38:03.223 --> 38:04.555
Hopefully within a few weeks.

38:04.557 --> 38:06.591
Is that how long
I'll have to rest?

38:06.593 --> 38:08.025
The opposite, actually.

38:08.027 --> 38:09.494
To help your brain
regain its normal function,

38:09.496 --> 38:11.529
it needs exercise.
Preferably,

38:11.531 --> 38:14.432
in an environment where you need
to associate names with faces.

38:14.434 --> 38:15.800
Hello, Blackstone.

38:15.802 --> 38:17.435
That's right.

38:17.437 --> 38:20.505
You have the perfect job
to facilitate your recovery.

38:26.412 --> 38:28.613
Congratulations.

38:28.615 --> 38:30.081
You signed the Blackstone.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.716
Yes.
Yes, I did.

38:31.718 --> 38:34.218
500 potential new clients.
That's...

38:34.220 --> 38:35.787
That's a lot.

38:35.789 --> 38:37.488
Uh, you're not
jumping up and down

38:37.490 --> 38:38.823
because...

38:38.825 --> 38:40.691
No, I'm compl--
Are you kidding me?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.794
I'm so excited.
This is like a huge deal.

38:42.796 --> 38:43.928
- Yeah.
- It's--

38:43.930 --> 38:46.364
Um, it's just--

38:46.366 --> 38:49.066
Yeah?

38:49.068 --> 38:51.102
Uh--

38:51.104 --> 38:52.904
you know what, just a little
executive branch talk

38:52.906 --> 38:54.205
- between...
- Oh.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.373
- If you don't mind, I--
- No, no.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.741
- I'll go wait in the car.
- Yeah. Just--

38:56.743 --> 38:58.209
Just business stuff.
- Okay.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.644
All right. So,

38:59.646 --> 39:01.512
I'm nervous about the amount of
business we're in for.

39:01.514 --> 39:04.248
Not medically. We have enough
doctors now, which is awesome.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.284
Organizationally.

39:06.286 --> 39:08.052
You have a me, right?
Who do I have?

39:08.054 --> 39:09.287
You need an Evan.

39:09.289 --> 39:10.254
I need an Evan, exactly.

39:10.256 --> 39:11.255
So get an Evan.

39:11.257 --> 39:13.925
I think Paige
wants to be an Evan.

39:13.927 --> 39:15.393
She keeps telling me
she wants to help, but I--

39:15.395 --> 39:16.561
So hire her.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.197
She could work for us
until school starts.

39:19.199 --> 39:21.933
She could be our
summer office manager.

39:21.935 --> 39:23.801
See, okay, this is the--

39:23.803 --> 39:25.436
I don't know, Henry.

39:25.438 --> 39:27.271
I don't know if Paige
should work at Hankmed.

39:27.273 --> 39:30.107
What are you worried about?

39:30.109 --> 39:32.043
That she'll hate
working with me.

39:32.045 --> 39:33.878
That I'll hate
working with her.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.247
That I'll somehow change
working around her,

39:36.249 --> 39:37.715
or she'll change
working around me.

39:37.717 --> 39:39.517
That we'll stop
being honest with each other,

39:39.519 --> 39:40.852
or we'll start being too honest,

39:40.854 --> 39:43.054
and then suddenly we're
screaming and yelling, at work,

39:43.056 --> 39:44.655
and I--
Saying things we regret

39:44.657 --> 39:45.756
and wish we could take back,

39:45.758 --> 39:46.891
but we can't take them back,

39:46.893 --> 39:48.159
and then oh, my God,
we break up,

39:48.161 --> 39:49.527
and we break up badly,
it's messy,

39:49.529 --> 39:51.562
everyone gets involved,
and it's a giant disa--

39:51.564 --> 39:55.199
It ends,
in a cataclysmic disaster.

39:55.201 --> 39:57.368
Other than that, nothing.

40:00.039 --> 40:02.707
I never thought I'd see the day
when Evan R. Lawson,

40:02.709 --> 40:03.908
CFO of Hankmed,

40:03.910 --> 40:05.710
wasn't willing to take a risk.

40:05.712 --> 40:07.044
I know.

40:07.046 --> 40:08.779
Ugh, it's freaking me out too.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.248
Take your time.

40:10.250 --> 40:12.250
Whatever you want,
whatever you decide,

40:12.252 --> 40:15.219
I support you 100%.

40:15.221 --> 40:17.555
Thank you.

40:20.726 --> 40:22.360
Ohh!

40:22.362 --> 40:24.028
I'm gonna hire her.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.229
Maybe you're right, you know?

40:25.231 --> 40:26.564
Maybe--
Maybe it'll be a good thing

40:26.566 --> 40:28.499
- working with her.
- Yeah.

40:28.501 --> 40:30.401
And if it doesn't work out,
I can just blame you.

40:30.403 --> 40:31.969
So it's a win-win for me
either way.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.037
Good.

40:37.242 --> 40:40.144
Hi.
I am so sorry I'm late.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.379
And I was just thinking

40:41.381 --> 40:44.015
how socially undependable
doctors can be.

40:50.556 --> 40:51.923
I have to go.

40:51.925 --> 40:53.691
Are you kidding?

40:53.693 --> 40:55.326
No.
I'm not.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.794
Is it an emergency?

40:56.796 --> 40:59.497
I need to go.
I'm sorry.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.599
Don't apologize.
It was my mistake

41:01.601 --> 41:03.401
for breaking my own rule.

41:03.403 --> 41:04.435
We'll reschedule?

41:04.437 --> 41:06.003
It's okay.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.005
Better this happens now
than on date number five,

41:08.007 --> 41:09.507
when I really liked you.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.610
I really am so sorry.
