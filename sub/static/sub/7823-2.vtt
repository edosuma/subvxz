01:39.430 --> 01:40.400
HURRY UP.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.820
ALL RIGHT.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.400
HOW ABOUT "HE"?

01:44.470 --> 01:45.970
TWO POINTS.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.870
YOUR TURN, DEAR.

01:47.940 --> 01:52.210
HOW COULD ANYONE MAKE A WORD
OUT OF THESE LOUSY LETTERS?

01:52.270 --> 01:53.170
OH, WAIT.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.310
HERE'S A GOOD ONE.

HEY, NO ABBREVIATIONS.

01:58.810 --> 01:59.810
NOT "I.D.," DAD.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.250
ID, IT'S A WORD.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.520
AS IN THIS GAME IS STUP-ID.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.890
HEY, SHUT UP, BOY.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.020
YEAH, BART, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DEVELOPING

02:07.090 --> 02:10.030
VERBAL ABILITIES FOR YOUR
BIG APTITUDE TEST TOMORROW.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.700
WE COULD LOOK THIS "ID" THING
UP IN THE DICTIONARY.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.930
WE GOT ONE?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.400
I THINK ITS UNDER THE SHORT
LEG OF THE COUCH.

02:19.030 --> 02:21.930

YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

02:42.090 --> 02:44.400

WHAT A KWYJIBO IS.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.050
IN THE TRASH CAN WITH IT.

03:10.850 --> 03:13.550
PRINCIPAL SKINNER,
ONE OF MY FELLOW CHILDREN

03:13.620 --> 03:15.520
IS VANDALIZING SCHOOL PROPERTY.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.860
OH, WHERE?

03:16.930 --> 03:18.330
OVER THERE, SIR.

03:18.390 --> 03:19.520
SEE?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.930
LOOK OUT, BART,
HERE COMES SKINNER.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.870
YIKES!

03:23.070 --> 03:23.900
HMM.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.640
WHOEVER DID THIS
IS IN VERY DEEP TROUBLE.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.240
AND A SLOPPY SPELLER, TOO.

03:31.310 --> 03:32.910
THE PREFERRED SPELLING OF WIENER

03:32.980 --> 03:36.210
IS W-I-E-N-E-R

03:36.280 --> 03:39.050
ALTHOUGH E-I IS
AN ACCEPTABLE ETHNIC VARIANCE.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.140
GOOD POINT.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.790
BOYS, LET'S SEE YOUR HANDS.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.320
MM-HMM.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.560
GOOD.

03:44.620 --> 03:45.820
OKAY.

03:45.890 --> 03:46.860
SIMPSON?

03:49.260 --> 03:51.030
YOU MIGHT SAY YOU CAUGHT
HIM RED-HANDED.

03:51.090 --> 03:54.190
SIMPSON, YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.260
SAME TIME, SAME PLACE?

03:56.330 --> 03:58.570
YES, IN MY OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.760
<i>OOH.</i>

04:01.640 --> 04:04.040

04:04.110 --> 04:05.810
BART, I HOPE YOU WON'T BEAR

04:05.870 --> 04:08.340
SOME SORT OF SIMPLE-MINDED
GRUDGE AGAINST ME.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.780
I WAS MERELY
TRYING TO FEND OFF

04:09.850 --> 04:11.180
THE DESECRATION OF THE
SCHOOL BUILDING.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.080
EAT MY SHORTS.

04:12.150 --> 04:13.220
PARDON?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.790
NOW, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY, CLASS.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.649
THESE TESTS WILL HAVE
NO EFFECT ON YOUR GRADES.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.190
THEY MERELY DETERMINE
YOUR FUTURE SOCIAL STATUS

04:19.250 --> 04:21.519
AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS...
IF ANY.

04:21.589 --> 04:24.200
MRS. KRABAPPEL, ISN'T BART
SUPPOSED TO FACE THE WINDOW

04:24.260 --> 04:26.860
SO HE WON'T BE TEMPTED TO LOOK
AT HIS NEIGHBOR'S PAPER?

04:26.930 --> 04:28.130
YOU'RE RIGHT, MARTIN.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.230
BART.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.500
REMEMBER TO VISUALIZE
THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS

04:32.570 --> 04:34.170
AND RELAX.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.540
THE TEST WILL START...

04:36.610 --> 04:37.710
NOW!

04:44.250 --> 04:47.890

COME WITH ME, BOY.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.500
WE'VE GOT A STOWAWAY, SIR.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.330
I'LL PAY. HOW MUCH?

05:34.400 --> 05:37.270
TWICE THE FARE
FROM TUCSON TO FLAGSTAFF

05:37.330 --> 05:41.160
MINUS TWO-THIRDS OF THE FARE
FROM ALBUQUERQUE TO EL PASO.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.870
BART, THERE ARE
STUDENTS IN THIS CLASS

05:52.950 --> 05:54.890
WITH A CHANCE TO DO WELL.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.550
WILL YOU STOP
BOTHERING THEM?

05:56.620 --> 05:58.260
HE'S NOT BOTHERING
ME, MRS. KRABAPPEL,

05:58.320 --> 05:59.360
I'M FINISHED.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.260
MAY I GO OUTSIDE
AND READ UNDER A TREE?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.280
CERTAINLY, MARTIN.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.040
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, BART?

06:15.100 --> 06:16.860
ARE THOSE NAUGHTY DOGS
BACK AGAIN?

06:24.610 --> 06:27.280
YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES, CLASS.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.220
( <i>humming )</i>

06:34.190 --> 06:36.660
HE'S A GOOD BOY NOW,
AND HE'S GETTING BETTER.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.300
AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE BEST
SHEEP STRAY FROM THE FLOCK

06:39.360 --> 06:41.070
AND NEED TO BE
HUGGED EXTRA HARD.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.770
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE KIND OF CRAPOLA

06:42.830 --> 06:44.140
THAT'S LOUSING HIM UP.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.100
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.370
"I AM A WEINER."

06:48.440 --> 06:50.480
HE SURE IS.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.710
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.040
SEND THEM IN.

06:54.110 --> 06:55.310
HELLO AGAIN,
PRINCIPAL SKINNER.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.720
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
THIS TIME, BOY?

06:57.780 --> 07:00.920
I CAUGHT YOUR SON DEFACING
SCHOOL PROPERTY THIS MORNING.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.310
WE ESTIMATE THE DAMAGE AT $75.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.060
AND FRANKLY WE THINK
IT'S TERRIBLY UNFAIR

07:05.120 --> 07:06.490
THAT OTHER TAXPAYERS
SHOULD FOOT THE BILL.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.190
YEAH, IT'S A CRUMMY SYSTEM,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

07:10.260 --> 07:12.300
OH, NO, HE CAN'T MEAN THAT.

07:12.360 --> 07:16.030
MY WIFE THINKS
YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR IT.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.000
THAT WAS THE IDEA.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.770
OH.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.530
BY ITSELF, SOMETHING
LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT CALL

07:20.600 --> 07:22.300
FOR AN EXTREME PENALTY

07:22.370 --> 07:24.910
BUT THIS IS NOT
AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

07:24.970 --> 07:27.640
BART'S BEHAVIOR IS UNRULY.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.210
HE'S FREQUENTLY ABSENT
FROM SCHOOL,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.120
THEN GIVES TEACHERS
PATHETIC EXCUSE NOTES

07:32.180 --> 07:34.490
THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY
CHILDISH FORGERIES

07:34.550 --> 07:35.720
WHEN COMPARED TO...

07:38.150 --> 07:42.520
WELL, AT ANY RATE,
IT IS MY RELUCTANT DECISION...

07:42.590 --> 07:44.800
Mr. Skinner,
Dr. Pryor is here to see you.

07:44.860 --> 07:45.800
He says it's urgent.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.200
SEND HIM IN.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.660
MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON, THIS IS
OUR DISTRICT PSYCHIATRIST

07:50.730 --> 07:52.360
DR. JAY LOREN PRYOR.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.660
WHAT DO WE NEED
A PSYCHIATRIST FOR?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.470
WE KNOW OUR KID IS NUTS.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.840
ON THE CONTRARY

07:56.910 --> 07:59.380
I HAVE SOME VERY EXCITING
NEWS FOR ALL OF US.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.280
THIS APTITUDE TEST
WE ADMINISTERED THIS MORNING

08:01.340 --> 08:02.870
HAS REVEALED THAT
THE YOUNG BART HERE IS

08:02.940 --> 08:04.040
WHAT WE CALL A "GIFTED CHILD."

08:04.110 --> 08:05.210
A WHAT?

08:05.280 --> 08:06.080
YOUR SON IS A GENIUS,
MR. SIMPSON.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.120
BART?

08:07.180 --> 08:08.090
THIS LUNKHEAD?

08:08.150 --> 08:09.190
IMPOSSIBLE.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.690
NO, NO, WE'RE
QUITE CERTAIN.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.780
THE CHILD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO
KNOW HIS OWN I.Q., OF COURSE,

08:12.850 --> 08:14.820
BUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEYOND
THE RANGE OF ANY DOUBT.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.300
912?!

08:17.360 --> 08:18.860
NO, YOU HAVE
IT UPSIDE DOWN.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.360
IT'S 216.

08:20.430 --> 08:21.630
OH.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.370
THAT'S STILL
AMAZINGLY HIGH.

08:23.430 --> 08:26.740
TELL ME, BART, ARE YOU
EVER BORED IN SCHOOL?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.770
OH, YOU BET.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.040
EVER FEEL A
LITTLE FRUSTRATED?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.780
ALL THE TIME, SIR.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.780
DO YOU EVER DREAM
OF LEAVING YOUR CLASS

08:34.840 --> 08:36.870
TO PURSUE YOUR OWN
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT

08:36.950 --> 08:38.320
ON AN INDEPENDENT BASIS?

08:38.380 --> 08:41.390
WOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
READING MY MIND, MAN.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.350
YOU SEE, WHEN A CHILD
WITH BART'S INTELLECT

08:43.419 --> 08:46.290
IS FORCED TO SLOW DOWN TO
THE PACE OF A NORMAL PERSON,

08:46.350 --> 08:48.080
HE'S PROBABLY GOING
TO LASH OUT IN WAYS

08:48.160 --> 08:49.790
LIKE THESE.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.630
I THINK WE SHOULD
RETEST HIM.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.620
NO, NO, I THINK
WE SHOULD MOVE HIM
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.000
OH, BETTER YET.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.820
BART, WE'D LIKE YOU
TO TRY A KIND OF SCHOOL

08:56.900 --> 09:01.770
THAT DOESN'T RELY ON GRADES
AND RULES AND BELLS AND BUZZERS.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.280
A SCHOOL WITHOUT WALLS,
WHERE YOU DO AS MUCH

09:04.340 --> 09:07.080
OR AS LITTLE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
AS YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.310
DOES THAT
SOUND GOOD, BART?

09:08.380 --> 09:09.550
SIGN ME UP, DOC.

09:09.610 --> 09:10.950
EXCELLENT, WE'RE
ALL SET, THEN.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.840
HERE'S ALL THE INFORMATION
YOU NEED.

09:12.910 --> 09:14.980
SHOW UP AROUND NINE-ISH.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.860
MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON,
CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN A
MOOD TO CELEBRATE.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.360
DOC, THIS IS ALL TOO MUCH.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.980
I MEAN, MY SON A
GENIUS?

09:23.060 --> 09:24.360
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN?

09:24.430 --> 09:27.700
WELL, GENIUS LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
IS USUALLY THE RESULT

09:27.760 --> 09:29.720
OF HEREDITY
AND ENVIRONMENT

09:29.800 --> 09:32.100
ALTHOUGH IN SOME CASES

09:32.170 --> 09:33.640
IT'S A TOTAL MYSTERY.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.110
AW, COME ON, MOM.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.000
YOU LOOK VERY
INTELLIGENT, DEAR.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.980
NO WAY.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.120
HOW ABOUT A TIE, SON?

09:46.180 --> 09:48.620
EVERYBODY KNOWS
BOY GENIUSES WEAR TIES.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.680
YOU'RE STIFLING
MY CREATIVITY, DAD.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.010
SORRY, BOY.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.390
BART, THIS IS A
BIG DAY FOR YOU.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.530
WHY DON'T YOU EAT SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE NUTRITIOUS?

09:55.590 --> 09:57.900
NONSENSE, MARGE,
FROSTY CRUSTY FLAKES

09:57.960 --> 09:59.560
ARE WHAT GOT HIM
WHERE HE IS TODAY.

09:59.630 --> 10:02.170
IT COULD BE ONE
OF THESE CHEMICALS HERE

10:02.230 --> 10:04.500
THAT MAKES HIM SO SMART.

10:04.570 --> 10:05.940
LISA, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY SOME OF THIS.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
HOMER!

10:07.070 --> 10:08.010
I'M JUST SAYING,
WHY NOT HAVE

10:08.070 --> 10:09.840
TWO GENIUSES
IN THE FAMILY?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.780
SORT OF A SPARE IN CASE
BART'S BRAIN BLOWS UP.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.880
I DON'T CARE WHAT THAT
STUPID TEST SAYS, BART.

10:14.940 --> 10:15.940
YOU'RE A DIMWIT.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.920
MAYBE SO,
BUT FROM NOW ON

10:17.980 --> 10:19.720
THIS DIMWIT
IS ON EASY STREET.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.390
NO RUSH, DAD.

10:22.450 --> 10:23.350
TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.290
GOTCHA.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.720
( <i>tires screeching )</i>

10:33.130 --> 10:35.300
OH, NO! TIES.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.490
DON'T WORRY, SON,
YOU CAN HAVE MINE.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.000
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW TO PUT ON A TIE.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.440
THE HOOK GOES
OVER THE TOP.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.860
AND THESE THINGS
GO IN THERE.

10:42.940 --> 10:43.770
THANKS, DAD.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.250
YOU KISSED ME.

10:49.310 --> 10:52.250
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A FATHER KISSING HIS SON.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.410
I THINK.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.690
NOW, GO ON, BOY.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.150
AND PAY ATTENTION.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.290
BECAUSE IF YOU DO, ONE DAY
YOU MAY ACHIEVE SOMETHING

10:59.350 --> 11:02.250
THAT WE SIMPSONS HAVE DREAMED
ABOUT FOR GENERATIONS.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.620
YOU MAY OUTSMART SOMEONE.

11:04.690 --> 11:08.390
( <i>yelps )</i>

11:08.460 --> 11:10.290
YOU MUST
BE BART SIMPSON.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.600
I'M MS. MALAINE,
YOUR LEARNING COORDINATOR.

11:13.670 --> 11:16.370
LET ME SAY RIGHT AT THE START
THAT WE HAVE ONE RULE HERE:

11:16.440 --> 11:18.040
MAKE YOUR OWN RULES.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.610
IF YOU FEEL SLEEPY

11:19.670 --> 11:21.270
TAKE A NAP.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.540
IF YOU GET BORED,
FEEL FREE TO

11:22.610 --> 11:24.450
TAKE OUT A BOOK
AND START READING.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.710
WHAT SHOULD I READ, MA'AM?

11:25.780 --> 11:26.920
WHY, ANYTHING YOU WANT, BART.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.020
OH.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.920
A COMIC BOOK?

11:33.990 --> 11:36.060
HOW DID THIS GET
MIXED IN HERE?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.820
WE USED IT LAST WEEK

11:37.890 --> 11:40.760
AS A PROP IN A FILM
WE MADE ABOUT ILLITERACY.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.400
BART, THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO
WILL SHARE YOUR WORK AREA.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.900
THIS IS ETHAN FOLEY.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.900
<i>O MEMSAHIB, BART.</i>

11:46.970 --> 11:48.470
<i>RABBI HAS MEMO.</i>

11:48.540 --> 11:50.010
WHAT?

11:50.070 --> 11:52.110
ETHAN'S VERY GOOD
WITH PALINDROMES--

11:52.170 --> 11:55.170
YOU KNOW, SENTENCES SPELLED
THE SAME BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.840
AND THIS IS
SIDNEY SWIFT.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.520
<i>TRABING NORM DOOG.</i>

11:58.580 --> 11:59.850
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

11:59.910 --> 12:01.110
OH, DON'T MIND SIDNEY.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.150
HE'S JUST SPEAKING
IN BACKWARDS PHONETICS TODAY.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.060
HE SAID,
"GOOD MORNING, BART."

12:06.120 --> 12:07.420
AND THIS IS CECILE SHAPIRO.

12:07.490 --> 12:08.430
HI, BART.

12:08.490 --> 12:09.390
COOL HAMSTERS.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.360
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

12:11.430 --> 12:15.100
HAMSTER #1 HAS BEEN INFECTED
WITH A STAPHYLOCOCCI VIRUS.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.120
HAMSTER #2
IS THE CONTROL HAMSTER.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.200
HI, LITTLE CONTROL HAMSTER.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.840
I WOULDN'T GET
TOO ATTACHED, BART.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.930
WE'RE DISSECTING HIM
NEXT WEEK.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.970
DISCOVER YOUR DESKS, PEOPLE.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.480
NOW, LET'S ALL WELCOME
THE NEWEST MEMBER

12:27.540 --> 12:30.470
OF OUR COLLECTIVE
EXPERIENCE, BART SIMPSON.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.250
HELLO.
<i>BONJOUR.
BON GIORNO.</i>

12:32.310 --> 12:34.380
AND NOW WE CAN CONTINUE
OUR DEBATE FROM YESTERDAY.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.950
WHEN WE LEFT OFF

12:36.020 --> 12:38.660
CALVIN AND TONIA WERE ARGUING
THAT FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.830
IF YOU ASK ME,
HUMAN KIND HAS FREEDOM.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.300
A FREEDOM FRAUGHT
WITH PARADOXES.

12:44.360 --> 12:48.070
FREUD SHOWS HOW CHILDHOOD
SHAPES OUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND

12:48.130 --> 12:49.670
BUT THIS HELPS US
TO THINK FOR OURSELVES.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.200
VERY GOOD, IAN.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.170
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PARADOX?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.800
WITHOUT LAW AND ORDER
MAN HAS NO FREEDOM.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.470
IF YOU WANT PEACE,
YOU MUST PREPARE FOR WAR.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.000
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.350
WELL, IT SEEMS THE SMARTEST
CHILD IN THE CLASS

13:05.410 --> 13:06.970
IS ALSO THE QUIETEST.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.990
BART, WHAT OTHER PARADOXES

13:09.050 --> 13:11.420
AFFECT OUR LIVES?

13:13.890 --> 13:18.730
WELL, YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DO,
AND YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DON'T.

13:18.790 --> 13:22.690
WELL, I GUESS THAT
WOULD BE A PARADOX, TOO.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.160
THANK YOU, BART.

13:24.230 --> 13:25.660
PHEW.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.770
TELL YOU WHAT, BART--

13:29.840 --> 13:30.980
I'LL TRADE YOU THE WEIGHT
OF A BOWLING BALL

13:31.040 --> 13:33.580
ON THE EIGHTH MOON OF JUPITER
FROM MY LUNCH

13:33.640 --> 13:37.050
FOR THE WEIGHT OF A FEATHER
ON THE SECOND MOON OF NEPTUNE

13:37.110 --> 13:38.020
FROM YOUR LUNCH.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.520
WELL, OKAY.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.990
THERE YOU GO.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.420

FOR FOUR GILLS OF YOURS.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.020
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.630
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.470
BART, WOULD YOU WAGER
YOUR CUPCAKE AGAINST MINE...?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.030
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.300

OF THE NEW KID?

13:59.370 --> 14:01.340
RATHER MEDIOCRE GENIUS.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.630
YES.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.470
NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL.

14:09.460 --> 14:10.430
SO, HOW WAS IT?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.400
OS OS.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.390

14:12.460 --> 14:13.820

14:13.900 --> 14:15.440
WOW.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.570
COMIC BOOKS?

I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT
TO OVERHEAT THE OLD NOGGIN, EH?

14:20.940 --> 14:22.210
TELL YOU WHAT.

14:22.270 --> 14:24.300
TO CELEBRATE YOUR FIRST DAY
OF GENIUS SCHOOL

14:24.380 --> 14:26.180
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
OUT FOR A ROUND

14:26.240 --> 14:28.110
OF FROSTY,

14:28.180 --> 14:29.220
ALL RIGHTY!

14:29.280 --> 14:31.720
BART, I FEEL SO BAD

14:31.780 --> 14:33.610
FOR GOING
SO MANY YEARS WITHOUT...

14:33.690 --> 14:37.060
MMM... WHAT'S THAT WORD

14:37.120 --> 14:38.930
WHERE YOU ENCOURAGE
SOMETHING TO GROW?

WITH A 216 I.Q.

CAN'T MAKE A SIMPLE
EXPERIMENT WORK, WELL,

TAKE A BART SIMPSON

SOMETHING'S WRONG.

WHAT MAKES THEM TICK.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.320
WHILE I TALK
TO PRINCIPAL SKINNER.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.990
PROPOSAL?

19:37.060 --> 19:39.690
YOU KNOW, OUTLINE YOUR PROJECT--
WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.990
WHAT YOU REQUIRE TO DO IT.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.000
GOTCHA, MAN.

19:43.190 --> 19:48.160
<i>"MY PROPOSAL BY BART SIMPSON.</i>

19:48.230 --> 19:53.230
<i>"I WANT TO PRETEND
I AM A REGULAR DUMB KID.</i>

19:53.300 --> 19:58.640
<i>BY THIS, I HOPE..."</i>

19:58.710 --> 20:00.210
<i>OH, NO.</i>

20:00.280 --> 20:03.720
<i>"FOR THIS, I WILL..."</i>

20:03.780 --> 20:06.250
<i>UMM...</i>

20:06.320 --> 20:09.990
<i>"REQUIRE..."</i>

20:10.050 --> 20:12.280
OH, MAN.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.960
<i>"MY CONFESSION BY BART SIMPSON.</i>

20:17.030 --> 20:21.670
<i>"I AM A REGULAR DUMB KID.</i>

20:21.730 --> 20:25.660
<i>I CHEATED
ON MY INTELLIGENCE TEST."</i>

20:25.740 --> 20:27.240
AH, FINISHED ALREADY?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.910
PRINCIPAL SKINNER WILL BE

20:28.970 --> 20:30.570
VERY INTERESTED TO...

20:33.310 --> 20:37.620
YOU KNOW,
YOU MISSPELLED CONFESSION.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.620
HEY, LOOKING GOOD, BART.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.310
BART, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:41.390 --> 20:43.690
I HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT
IN CHEMISTRY TODAY.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.620
WELL, I BET IT'S
NOTHING A LITTLE

20:45.690 --> 20:47.090
TURPENTINE WON'T TAKE OFF.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.260
COME ON, SON.

20:49.590 --> 20:50.990
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, SON.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.730
I BET EINSTEIN TURNED HIMSELF
ALL SORTS OF COLORS

20:53.800 --> 20:56.000
BEFORE HE INVENTED
THE LIGHT BULB.

20:56.070 --> 20:58.240
DAD, I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.230
HOPE YOU WON'T BE TOO MAD.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.530
WHAT IS IT, SON?

21:01.610 --> 21:03.780
I'M NOT A GENIUS, DAD.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.180
WHAT?

21:05.240 --> 21:08.170
I CHEATED
ON THE INTELLIGENCE TEST.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.220
I'M SORRY.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.280
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY

21:11.350 --> 21:13.850
THAT THE PAST FEW WEEKS
HAVE BEEN GREAT.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.060
ME AND YOU
HAVE DONE STUFF TOGETHER.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.990
YOU'VE HELPED ME OUT
WITH THINGS, AND--

21:18.060 --> 21:20.330
WE'RE CLOSER
THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN.

21:20.390 --> 21:22.500
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.500
AND I THINK IF SOMETHING
CAN BRING US THAT CLOSE

21:26.560 --> 21:28.660
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE BAD.

21:29.970 --> 21:31.000
WHY, YOU LITTLE..!

21:31.070 --> 21:31.910
UH-OH.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.600
( <i>screaming )</i>

21:34.670 --> 21:36.700
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

21:36.770 --> 21:39.470
I THINK BART'S
STUPID AGAIN, MOM.

21:39.540 --> 21:40.870
OH, WELL...

21:40.950 --> 21:42.850
( <i>wailing )</i>

21:42.910 --> 21:45.080
YOU CAN'T STAY
IN THERE FOREVER!

21:45.150 --> 21:46.250
I CAN TRY!

21:46.320 --> 21:47.920
MARCH YOUR BUTT RIGHT OUT HERE!

21:47.990 --> 21:48.960
NOW!

21:49.020 --> 21:50.320
NO WAY, MAN.

21:50.390 --> 21:51.990
BUT..!

21:52.060 --> 21:55.760
SON, IF YOU DON'T COME OUT,
I CAN'T HUG YOU AND KISS YOU

21:55.830 --> 21:57.830
AND MAKE YOU FEEL
ALL BETTER.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.870
YOU THINK I'M DUMB ENOUGH
TO FALL FOR THAT?

21:59.930 --> 22:01.300
I'M INSULTED.
