00:06.002 --> 00:07.460
Hey, folks,

00:07.545 --> 00:10.505
I know the Mets are down 3-0
in a best of seven.

00:10.589 --> 00:12.007
l know no World Series team

00:12.091 --> 00:14.926
has ever come back
from 3-0 down to win four straight.

00:15.011 --> 00:18.471
l know they haven't played well.
l know the pitching's been bad.

00:18.556 --> 00:24.144
l know "no clutch hitting,"
l know '86/'69 seem a long, long time ago.

00:24.228 --> 00:25.770
And there's no Ruth, there's no Gehrig.

00:25.855 --> 00:28.148
Goodness gracious,
there's no Donn Clendenon.

00:28.232 --> 00:31.026
But you are not out of it

00:31.110 --> 00:34.487
until you lose four games
in a best of seven.

00:34.572 --> 00:37.782
That is all there is to it.

00:38.909 --> 00:41.036
Back to the phones we go.
Bruce is in Bayside.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.912
-Bruce, how are you?
-How you doing, Chris?

00:42.997 --> 00:44.622
Good to have you aboard, bud. What's up?

00:44.707 --> 00:46.708
Listen, I'm writing off this season.

00:46.792 --> 00:48.168
As far as I'm concerned,
the Mets are out of it.

00:48.252 --> 00:50.045
They're down 3-0.
They might as well pack their bags.

00:50.129 --> 00:52.630
-Write it off?
-Wait a second, my concern is next year.

00:52.715 --> 00:55.133
-What do you mean, write it off?
-You look at great teams of the past,

00:55.217 --> 00:57.469
the A's in '88, the PhiIIies back in the '50s,

00:57.553 --> 00:59.554
the lndians in '54 won
over a hundred games.

00:59.638 --> 01:02.474
The following years, these teams wouldn't
have been anything, they were no good.

01:02.558 --> 01:04.349
-All right.
-The Mets, they'll be out of it this year.

01:04.435 --> 01:05.935
-Question!
-They need to worry about next year.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.520
Did the Indians in '54 say,

01:07.605 --> 01:09.856
after they lost the third game to the Giants,

01:09.940 --> 01:13.526
"You know, let's not show up for Game 4.
We've lost. Let's rebuild for next year"?

01:13.611 --> 01:15.361
They might as well have.
They might as well have.

01:15.446 --> 01:20.408
Hey, the A's won in '89,
and it's not easy to win every single year.

01:20.493 --> 01:23.244
This is a team that has proven
they cannot win in the clutch.

01:23.329 --> 01:24.704
It's so obvious. Every year they...

01:24.789 --> 01:26.664
They won in '86, didn't they?

01:26.749 --> 01:29.292
They won in '86 because a guy couldn't
field a ground ball.

01:29.376 --> 01:30.418
lf l was on first base...

01:30.503 --> 01:32.712
How about the playoffs
and the World Series, Bruce?

01:32.797 --> 01:35.715
The Mets would've lost the World Series
if I was playing first base.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.802
That is incorrect
because the game was tied...

01:53.692 --> 01:55.735
Let's go! Let's go!

02:03.327 --> 02:07.288
How many times you be late for school?
Your sister gets to school on time.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.167
What's the problem with you guys?

02:13.045 --> 02:15.171
You want to be driven around
like you're the President,

02:15.256 --> 02:17.423
like l'm your goddamn chauffeur.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.259
-Dad, it wasn't our fault.
-Dad, it wasn't our fault.

02:19.343 --> 02:23.263
-Oh, yeah? Whose fault was it? Mine?
-No.

02:23.347 --> 02:26.850
Aunt Wendy told us
to take out the garbage,

02:26.934 --> 02:29.602
-and she hogged up the bathroom.
-Hogged up the bathroom.

02:29.687 --> 02:30.770
All morning.

02:30.855 --> 02:33.606
We couldn't get in there
to brush our teeth or do anything.

02:33.691 --> 02:37.569
We had to wait till she got out.
By the time we got out, the bus was gone.

02:37.653 --> 02:39.529
So how are we supposed to be on time?

02:39.613 --> 02:41.781
This is the only way we're gonna get there.

02:41.866 --> 02:44.826
Hey, listen to me.
l'm the boss, not Aunt Wendy.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.744
When it's your turn to use the bathroom,

02:46.829 --> 02:50.790
you tell Aunt Wendy
to get the fuck out of the bathroom.

02:50.875 --> 02:52.959
What are you, men or mice?

02:53.836 --> 02:55.295
"She's hogging the bathroom."

02:55.379 --> 02:57.005
Call me. l'll throw her the fuck out.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.673
...every facet of the game.

02:58.757 --> 03:00.466
They're being outpitched,
they're being outslugged,

03:00.551 --> 03:01.718
and they're being out-fielded.

03:01.802 --> 03:04.304
They're also being out-efforted,
if there's such a word.

03:04.388 --> 03:06.306
They're going to lose 4-0.

03:06.390 --> 03:07.807
No, they're not. They're gonna win.

03:07.892 --> 03:09.517
-Strawberry's fucking killing them.
-They're going to lose!

03:09.602 --> 03:10.810
-Gonna win!
-They're going to lose!

03:10.895 --> 03:12.478
Knock it off.

03:12.563 --> 03:16.482
David Cone will be the starter at Game 4,
and that has a lot of fans, myself...

03:16.567 --> 03:17.984
Strawberry's killing them.

03:18.068 --> 03:19.611
Not only will Cone be setting the pace...

03:19.695 --> 03:22.030
Go Coney! Yeah! All right!

03:22.114 --> 03:24.365
-Knock it off, will you?
-Come on.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.367
Give me a goddamn headache.

03:26.452 --> 03:30.622
l know all five of those runs were unearned.
l still don't think that's...

03:30.706 --> 03:31.956
Bye, Dad.

03:33.292 --> 03:34.626
-Bye, Dad.
-Yeah.

03:34.919 --> 03:37.378
-Bye, Dad.
-See you.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.879
The next two games
in this series are at Shea.

04:19.964 --> 04:20.964
If they can win them

04:21.048 --> 04:23.132
that at least puts a doubt
in the minds of the Dodgers,

04:23.217 --> 04:24.509
and that's what the Mets need.

04:24.593 --> 04:27.512
They need to prove
that the Dodgers are not invincible.

04:27.596 --> 04:29.055
It wouId aIso restore their confidence,

04:29.139 --> 04:30.348
and the Mets are a dangerous team

04:30.432 --> 04:32.433
when they get on a roll
and start believing in themselves.

04:32.518 --> 04:34.269
Jeff Torborg called a closed-door...

04:34.478 --> 04:35.561
Get some shots.

04:35.646 --> 04:38.982
l want some shots over here,
from this window here.

04:40.693 --> 04:42.402
Mikey, come here.

04:42.486 --> 04:45.822
l think we got some prints over here
on the inside of this door.

04:47.157 --> 04:50.243
Right on the inside here. Try and get them.

04:52.413 --> 04:54.289
How you doing?

04:54.373 --> 04:58.584
l got two young girls,
shot in the head twice each.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.586
lt's kind of messy. Over here, Mikey.

05:00.671 --> 05:02.588
Get some pictures
from the other side there, please.

05:02.673 --> 05:06.009
l don't know if they're still wearing
the rounds in their head or what.

05:06.093 --> 05:08.845
Hey, Mikey, get this back door over there.

05:08.929 --> 05:12.515
There's something on the inside.
Around... On that door. Thank you.

05:21.567 --> 05:24.319
-Anybody see anybody?
-Yeah, a dookie.

05:24.403 --> 05:26.362
We got this one Chinese guy over here

05:26.447 --> 05:28.781
who saw a couple guys
running over these park benches

05:28.866 --> 05:30.158
towards Park Avenue.

05:30.242 --> 05:33.119
We got a pretty good description
on the two guys.

05:33.203 --> 05:36.372
The uniformed guy put it on the air.
We'll see what happens.

05:36.457 --> 05:38.666
Michael, on the inside of that door.

05:40.419 --> 05:42.712
And let me have some shots
on the eye-level.

05:42.796 --> 05:45.340
Mets my ass. Dodgers are smoking, huh?

05:45.424 --> 05:47.050
Yeah, they're smoking.
But what about tomorrow?

05:48.052 --> 05:50.803
What are you thinking? You like the Mets?

05:50.888 --> 05:54.599
-What do you think of that shit back there?
-Terrible.

05:54.683 --> 05:56.184
You guys got money coming.
What are you gonna do?

05:56.268 --> 05:57.352
Dodgers all the way.

05:57.770 --> 05:58.895
l'd save your money.

05:58.979 --> 06:00.271
With Cone pitching?

06:00.356 --> 06:02.315
That Conehead motherfucker
got rocked the first game.

06:02.566 --> 06:03.816
l wouldn't bury the Mets.

06:03.901 --> 06:05.068
Even money with Cone pitching?

06:05.652 --> 06:06.819
That's right.

06:06.904 --> 06:09.781
You don't think they're
going to beat him twice, do you?

06:13.994 --> 06:16.996
You're right.
Not only that, they're due, man.

06:17.081 --> 06:18.623
Put my three on the Mets. Even money.

06:18.707 --> 06:20.291
Listen,

06:21.418 --> 06:23.461
take the five. Put it on the Mets.

06:23.879 --> 06:25.880
You say that like it's
a fucking death sentence.

06:25.964 --> 06:27.632
lt's a smart bet.

06:29.093 --> 06:30.802
l think it is a fucking death sentence.

06:31.261 --> 06:32.637
Strawberry burns.

06:32.721 --> 06:34.430
Nah, man. He can't win the four in a row.

06:34.515 --> 06:36.682
-No? All right.
-Three. That's it, max.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.101
-Max.
-What about Strawberry?

06:47.778 --> 06:50.029
Yeah. Give me a cup of coffee.

06:50.906 --> 06:52.782
Don't put on the cover.

07:31.321 --> 07:33.489
-Hello.
-Mike, how are you?

07:33.574 --> 07:34.866
What's up, guy? How are you doing?

07:34.950 --> 07:36.492
Here's what we're going to do.

07:36.577 --> 07:38.244
We took in 1 0,000 in action.

07:38.328 --> 07:41.289
We got six on the Mets,
four on the Dodgers.

07:41.665 --> 07:45.334
Plus, l want another 1 5,000
of my own on LA.

07:45.419 --> 07:47.336
Fifteen? But that's what you're up.

07:47.421 --> 07:48.921
Why don't you just go ahead?

07:49.006 --> 07:51.257
Hey, don't give me that bullshit.

07:51.341 --> 07:52.758
The Dodgers are a lock.

07:52.843 --> 07:54.385
Are you sure?

07:54.470 --> 07:57.096
Just put in the bet.
l'm going to make some money.

07:57.181 --> 07:58.806
You got it, guy.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.225
Give me something to cook.

08:42.308 --> 08:43.683
What's up, man?

08:45.354 --> 08:46.729
Here you go.

08:49.107 --> 08:50.274
Thanks.

08:54.154 --> 08:55.655
lt's good shit.

08:55.739 --> 08:57.657
You can cut it in half.

09:08.418 --> 09:11.087
Shit's going to kill you, man.

09:11.171 --> 09:15.258
What the fuck are you,
a drug counselor or a drug dealer?

09:15.342 --> 09:16.467
Never do your own product.

09:16.552 --> 09:18.886
What kind of fucking businessman are you?

09:47.499 --> 09:50.376
Get back. Police activity.

09:57.801 --> 10:00.386
Give me something back for the road.

10:26.663 --> 10:30.249
l'll see you in a couple of days,
and l'll have the money.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.976
-He's the thief!
-Relax.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.146
-Which one of you guys got the money?
-We ain't got no money.

12:57.230 --> 12:59.315
Empty your pockets out, the two of you.

12:59.399 --> 13:01.108
-What is this, man?
-Empty your pockets. Let me see 'em.

13:01.193 --> 13:03.486
lf we wasn't black,
you wouldn't be doing this shit.

13:04.154 --> 13:06.489
-lt's him. lt's him.
-Shut the hell up, man.

13:06.573 --> 13:08.616
-Cops, arrest him.
-What's going on?

13:08.700 --> 13:11.494
Lieutenant, sir, the owner says
they stole cash from the register.

13:11.578 --> 13:13.996
-The owner's full of shit...
-Shut the fuck up!

13:14.414 --> 13:18.083
He was chasing them down the block
when l caught up with them.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.710
Get me a Bud, a High Boy.

13:19.795 --> 13:21.337
Make sure it's fucking cold.
l'll straighten this out.

13:22.839 --> 13:24.298
-This is bullshit, man.
-That's him.

13:24.549 --> 13:27.676
-lt's him. Arrest him. Arrest him.
-How much did they take?

13:27.761 --> 13:30.262
-How much did they take?
-$500.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.681
-You're out of your mind, man.
-Shut your...

13:32.766 --> 13:34.308
What the fuck?

13:35.936 --> 13:39.522
Take this guy down to the precinct
and make out a report.

13:41.858 --> 13:43.818
-You'll have to come with me, sir.
-No.

13:43.902 --> 13:45.486
-Relax. Just relax.
-No, l don't want to go.

13:45.570 --> 13:48.155
-lt's gonna be okay. Just relax.
-No.

13:52.452 --> 13:54.411
Give me the fucking money now.

14:08.552 --> 14:10.636
Get the fuck out of here.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.511
Your daddy will be right back.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.440
The door sticks. Just a second.

15:10.447 --> 15:12.823
Wow, you're just on time.

15:14.159 --> 15:18.787
Got some very, very fine brown shit for you.

15:19.831 --> 15:20.956
Yeah?

15:21.625 --> 15:23.626
Same you loved last time you were here.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.962
No, nobody there. Nobody there.

15:31.635 --> 15:34.511
Here. Where's your pipe?

15:52.322 --> 15:53.739
You ready?

16:01.164 --> 16:02.164
Here.

16:02.248 --> 16:04.500
This one is yours.

16:07.921 --> 16:10.673
Let's see. Where did l put the lighter?

16:11.049 --> 16:12.841
Here's the lighter.

16:14.928 --> 16:16.804
You got a lighter.

16:18.556 --> 16:20.557
l'll light my cigarette.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.018
lt's lit. Oh, my God.

16:39.661 --> 16:42.204
l'll get you a little bit more here.

16:51.214 --> 16:53.257
Give me a little more.

16:53.341 --> 16:54.842
There you go.

17:00.807 --> 17:03.559
lt's a big pile.

19:38.047 --> 19:40.674
Please leave your message after the beep.

19:45.471 --> 19:47.764
Hi. It's David. Talk to you later.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.350
Hello?

19:52.478 --> 19:54.354
I already received it.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.859
Hello? Hello?

20:00.653 --> 20:02.321
Hello?

20:04.574 --> 20:08.285
So with Brett Butler on third
and KaI DanieIs on first,

20:08.369 --> 20:11.413
Strawberry stands in against David Cone.

20:11.497 --> 20:13.624
Cone leaning in for the sign.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.125
He goes to the stretch.

20:15.210 --> 20:16.418
The pitch on the way,

20:16.502 --> 20:20.339
and it's a long high blast
to right center field.

20:20.423 --> 20:24.343
Over the fence and off the scoreboard
at Shea Stadium.

20:24.427 --> 20:27.429
Darryl Strawberry trots it out
around the bases,

20:27.513 --> 20:31.725
and he hits one of those moon shots
that have trademarked his career.

20:31.809 --> 20:34.895
Quite a clout, but maybe too little too late.

20:34.979 --> 20:38.815
A Mets 1 1-0 lead is now 1 1-3.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.026
A three-run homer for Strawberry.

20:41.110 --> 20:43.070
His third home run of the series,

20:43.154 --> 20:46.323
and RBIs 10, 1 1 , and 12.

20:46.407 --> 20:48.116
It's 1 1-3, Mets.

20:48.201 --> 20:50.953
No matter how far Strawberry hits a ball,

20:51.037 --> 20:55.123
he cannot drive in enough runs
to get the Dodgers back in this game.

20:55.208 --> 20:56.500
Strawberry with the moon shot

20:56.584 --> 20:59.878
getting congratulations
in the Dodger dugout.

20:59.963 --> 21:02.089
That brings Eric Davis to the plate,

21:02.173 --> 21:04.716
and right now all the Dodgers
want to try and do

21:04.801 --> 21:06.093
is cIose the Mets out,

21:06.177 --> 21:08.720
gain some momentum back
going into Game 5.

21:08.805 --> 21:11.974
If they can make a little noise here,
get some offense going...

21:12.600 --> 21:17.271
Give her a piece of cake. Mom, you okay?
Have a little bit of cake.

21:18.314 --> 21:20.357
Hey, Strawberry, want a cup of coffee?

21:20.441 --> 21:22.609
Cone into the windup. Here's the first pitch.

21:22.694 --> 21:25.404
Why don't you come here
and have a cup of coffee with us.

21:25.488 --> 21:28.282
Davis again stepping out.
Looks for the sign.

21:28.366 --> 21:30.867
Steps back in.

21:31.160 --> 21:35.706
You know, Iet's face it, foIks,
I know they got a ways to go yet.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.582
I know they have a ways to go.

21:37.667 --> 21:41.712
But the Dodgers blew a match point.

21:41.796 --> 21:45.632
-PossibIe man shot, 1 53...
-I'll tell you something right now.

21:45.717 --> 21:49.511
The first one to get is always the hardest
to get when you're down by a large...

21:49.595 --> 21:53.056
Confirmed, man shot. 1 53 Jane Street.

22:07.864 --> 22:09.614
Hey, Veronica, baby, what's going on?

22:09.699 --> 22:12.451
There's a ki somewhere in the back seat.

22:16.456 --> 22:17.664
Hey. How you doing?

22:18.666 --> 22:20.417
What we got here is
a black male with his throat cut.

22:20.501 --> 22:22.002
-Somebody look at him?
-Yeah, probably.

22:22.086 --> 22:23.545
-Anybody check the car?
-Not yet.

22:23.629 --> 22:26.131
-l'll check the car.
-All right. Good.

22:26.215 --> 22:27.716
Hey, Sarge.

22:28.009 --> 22:29.176
How are you doing, boss? What do we got?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.303
l've got a black male with his throat slit.

22:31.387 --> 22:34.222
-lt looks like he's going to...
-Any weapons?

22:34.891 --> 22:36.767
Lieutenant's checking the seat now.

22:36.851 --> 22:38.643
How about any witnesses?

22:38.728 --> 22:42.397
First three uniform guys on the scene
got two, possible relatives.

22:42.482 --> 22:45.233
Let me see what the Lieutenant
wants us to do here.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.533
-What's that?
-Looks like a ki of coke.

22:54.535 --> 22:56.286
Put it in evidence.

23:06.631 --> 23:09.216
Hey, l want you two guys
to go contact yourjunkie friends

23:09.300 --> 23:11.676
over there on 25th Street till we get up.

23:11.761 --> 23:14.179
You two guys go over
to them two pawnshops,

23:14.263 --> 23:15.555
see what else we can get from that.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.015
What's going on?

23:17.100 --> 23:19.518
They raped a nun up in Spanish Harlem.

23:19.602 --> 23:22.604
lmagine having that happen to you.
l would've killed these motherfuckers.

23:22.772 --> 23:25.732
They took the fucking chalice.
The host was still in there.

23:25.817 --> 23:26.858
What they want with the host?

23:26.943 --> 23:29.236
What the fuck you think?
What, you think they wanna eat the host?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.780
They wanted to pawn
the fucking chalice off.

23:31.864 --> 23:33.407
Put up a $50,000 reward.

23:34.117 --> 23:36.118
Leave it to the Catholic Church.

23:36.202 --> 23:38.036
Girls get raped every day.

23:38.121 --> 23:39.371
Now they're gonna put up 50 Gs

23:39.455 --> 23:41.915
just because these chicks
wear penguin suits.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.458
What is your fucking problem?

23:45.878 --> 23:47.212
The Church is a racket.

23:47.296 --> 23:49.131
So what? Are you a Catholic?

23:49.298 --> 23:50.799
l'm a Catholic.

23:57.223 --> 24:00.475
Why don't you have a little bit
of fucking respect?

24:00.935 --> 24:02.894
Hey, fuck that noise.

24:02.979 --> 24:05.230
How about them Mets?
Bet you won a shitload.

24:05.314 --> 24:06.481
More than you did.

24:06.566 --> 24:07.983
l want to get paid.

24:08.651 --> 24:10.360
What about tomorrow?

24:10.445 --> 24:12.237
What do you guys want to do?

24:12.321 --> 24:15.157
Want to make a bundle?
Leave it all on the Mets.

24:15.241 --> 24:18.076
What, you think they're
going to beat Martinez?

24:18.161 --> 24:21.288
The series has got to last seven games.

24:21.664 --> 24:24.207
You know how much money is riding
on commercial time alone?

24:24.292 --> 24:26.126
A New York/LA team?

24:27.336 --> 24:31.089
When's the last time a series in New York
did not last seven games?

24:32.133 --> 24:35.135
You know the revenue alone
in TV commercials?

24:35.470 --> 24:37.512
Endorsements for the players?

24:37.597 --> 24:39.598
The income it's bringing into the city
for transportation?

24:39.682 --> 24:42.851
There are no fucking jobs
in New York, are there?

24:43.728 --> 24:45.437
There's no way the series
is gonna end tomorrow.

24:45.521 --> 24:47.522
There's too many people want to milk it
for what it's worth.

24:48.149 --> 24:50.150
Did l steer you wrong yesterday?

24:52.528 --> 24:55.697
You want to make a smart move?
Leave it on the Mets.

24:56.324 --> 24:58.241
What do you want to do?

25:02.038 --> 25:03.038
l'm in.

25:06.459 --> 25:08.293
Are you a doubter? l'll tell you what, then.

25:08.377 --> 25:10.337
Don't listen to the way
l steered you yesterday.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.630
All right?

25:11.714 --> 25:13.924
So you owe me money.

25:14.008 --> 25:15.383
What do you want to do?

25:56.676 --> 26:01.179
Dr. Sherman, 247. Dr. Sherman, 247.

26:02.098 --> 26:04.349
Can l help you with something?

26:05.017 --> 26:07.519
l'm in charge of the investigation.

26:09.272 --> 26:11.231
Just checking security.

26:12.275 --> 26:13.567
Security?

26:14.527 --> 26:16.778
Wouldn't want the guys
coming back, would you?

26:16.862 --> 26:18.446
For the nun,

26:18.531 --> 26:19.948
or for you.

26:33.170 --> 26:36.715
Here are the soiled undergarments
and the nun's habit.

26:36.799 --> 26:39.509
They're to be taken by you for evidence.

26:40.011 --> 26:44.306
Now, black pubic hair other than the patient

26:44.390 --> 26:47.017
was found during comb inspection.

26:47.101 --> 26:49.144
Here are the samples of that.

26:50.396 --> 26:53.106
There was trauma to the vaginal mucosa

26:53.190 --> 26:55.567
with multiple lacerations

26:55.651 --> 26:58.236
that appear to be made with a sharp object,

26:58.321 --> 27:00.989
in which the hymen membrane was broken.

27:02.867 --> 27:06.411
lt was stated that this object was a crucifix.

27:08.414 --> 27:10.790
Trauma consistent
with multiple penetration.

27:12.168 --> 27:13.877
Three-centimeter laceration.

27:14.295 --> 27:15.587
Let the Mets be uplifted.

27:15.671 --> 27:18.048
Let the Mets have a nice dinner at home.

27:18.132 --> 27:20.342
Let the Mets look
at the post-game highlights

27:20.426 --> 27:23.053
and see base hits all over the place.

27:23.429 --> 27:26.556
One bullet has been dodged!

27:27.516 --> 27:31.102
Just a couple more to go,
and I'll tell you something right now.

27:31.187 --> 27:35.607
The longer this series goes,
the longer this series goes,

27:35.691 --> 27:40.362
the Dodgers will get awfully tight,
and if it somehow gets to a Game 7...

27:55.127 --> 27:57.879
You girls know you're driving
with a taillight out?

27:58.005 --> 28:00.882
-Really?
-Yeah.

28:01.008 --> 28:03.009
No, we didn't know.

28:03.094 --> 28:04.344
But thank you for telling us.

28:04.428 --> 28:07.263
Let me see your license and registration.

28:12.228 --> 28:13.978
Hey.

28:14.063 --> 28:17.357
-Where's your license?
-Actually, l don't have my license with me.

28:17.441 --> 28:19.526
-You don't?
-No.

28:20.027 --> 28:23.655
-Do you have a driver's license?
-No.

28:23.739 --> 28:26.491
You don't have it with you?

28:26.575 --> 28:29.035
Whose car is this?

28:29.120 --> 28:31.162
Listen, this is our father's car.

28:31.247 --> 28:33.581
We don't have a license.

28:33.916 --> 28:34.999
Yeah?

28:37.044 --> 28:39.003
Does he know you got it?

28:40.089 --> 28:41.256
Yeah.

28:41.340 --> 28:42.632
He does?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.970
Does he know you got the car?

28:47.096 --> 28:48.763
Well, not exactly.

28:50.307 --> 28:52.142
-You being bad girls, huh?
-But it is our dad's...

28:52.226 --> 28:54.018
You being bad girls?

28:55.312 --> 28:57.397
Where are you coming from?

28:59.275 --> 29:00.692
New Jersey.

29:00.776 --> 29:01.943
Yeah?

29:02.695 --> 29:04.571
Got any drugs in the car?

29:04.655 --> 29:06.156
-No.
-No.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.533
-No drugs?
-No.

29:08.617 --> 29:10.535
-Of course not.
-Where were you tonight?

29:10.703 --> 29:13.538
We were at the Kat Club.

29:13.622 --> 29:15.540
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:15.624 --> 29:18.460
Yeah. We were at the Kat Club. Big deal.

29:19.170 --> 29:21.588
l should take you in for driving
without a license and registration.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.883
You know that, don't you?
That's a serious thing.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.803
Have to call your father up.

29:30.306 --> 29:31.890
How do you feel about that?

29:31.974 --> 29:33.975
Don't do that.

29:34.101 --> 29:35.518
Yeah?

29:36.645 --> 29:39.731
What were you girls doing at the,
what was it, the Kit Kat Club?

29:39.815 --> 29:44.068
Get a little stoned there?
Come on. l'm not going to...

29:44.153 --> 29:46.029
l'll do the right thing
if you do the right thing.

29:46.113 --> 29:47.739
l know what it's like
to get stoned a little bit,

29:47.823 --> 29:49.866
to get high a little bit.

29:50.826 --> 29:54.078
You're getting stoned there?
Have any grass there? Coke?

29:54.163 --> 29:56.790
-We smoked a little grass.
-Yeah?

29:57.374 --> 30:00.794
How would your father feel
if he knew you were here now?

30:00.878 --> 30:02.670
You won't tell him.

30:03.214 --> 30:06.341
Well, that depends.
What do you think about that?

30:07.259 --> 30:09.594
A couple of very beautiful girls,
you know that?

30:09.678 --> 30:12.138
Come on. Give us a break.

30:14.266 --> 30:20.438
Couldn't you just give us a warning
for the taillight and let us go home?

30:21.774 --> 30:25.568
Well, you know something?
Two such beautiful girls like you,

30:25.653 --> 30:27.779
l could give you a warning.

30:28.614 --> 30:30.365
You want a warning?

30:31.951 --> 30:33.952
Well, here's the warning.

30:34.703 --> 30:36.412
You do something for me,
and l'll do something for you.

30:36.497 --> 30:38.623
What do you say about that?

30:39.542 --> 30:41.543
You do something for me,
and your father won't find out

30:41.627 --> 30:44.879
you took his car
and you're driving without a license.

30:48.551 --> 30:50.385
You got a boyfriend?

30:51.387 --> 30:53.763
-You got a boyfriend?
-No.

30:54.181 --> 30:55.515
You don't?

30:56.308 --> 30:59.394
l'll tell you something right now.
Now listen up to me, okay?

30:59.478 --> 31:02.313
l'm going to take you down to
the precinct house and call your father.

31:02.398 --> 31:03.815
You hear me?

31:04.191 --> 31:07.151
-You hear me?
-You can't do that.

31:07.236 --> 31:09.654
What will you do for me if l don't do that?

31:09.738 --> 31:11.614
Whatever you say.

31:11.699 --> 31:14.075
-Yeah?
-You can't call our father.

31:24.378 --> 31:26.504
You ever suck a guy's cock?

31:28.340 --> 31:29.591
Did you?

31:31.051 --> 31:32.552
Look at me. You...

31:33.637 --> 31:35.096
You ever suck a guy's cock?

31:36.515 --> 31:37.599
Hey.

31:38.642 --> 31:40.226
l'm talking to you.
You ever suck a guy's cock?

31:40.311 --> 31:41.728
Are you serious?

31:41.812 --> 31:44.772
Did you? Did you?

31:44.940 --> 31:47.150
-Well, yeah. So?
-Yeah?

31:47.568 --> 31:50.528
Don't talk back. Don't talk to me that way.
You hear me?

31:50.613 --> 31:52.488
Don't you talk to me that way.

31:52.573 --> 31:54.407
l'm going to haul your ass right in.
You hear me?

31:54.491 --> 31:55.825
l'm sorry.

32:02.041 --> 32:03.750
Just let us go.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.295
-We'll get it fixed in the morning.
-l'll let you go. l'll let you go.

32:07.379 --> 32:09.756
Turn around. l want to see your ass.
Do you mind that?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.841
Just one look at your ass, okay?

32:11.926 --> 32:13.259
What do you say?

32:19.183 --> 32:21.768
You, come here. Look at me. Look at me.

32:22.227 --> 32:24.354
You ever suck a guy's cock?

Show me your mouth.

32:49.630 --> 32:50.713
What's the big fucking deal?

32:50.798 --> 32:53.007
You've sucked guys' cocks before,

32:53.342 --> 32:54.634
Come on.

32:57.346 --> 33:01.140

33:06.647 --> 33:08.481
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

33:08.565 --> 33:12.777
lt's the last time l'm going to ask you
or l'm taking you in, you hear me?

33:12.861 --> 33:15.071
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

33:15.155 --> 33:18.700
Show me with your mouth.
Show me with your mouth.

33:18.784 --> 33:20.451
Come on. Spit that gum out.
Give me the gum.

33:20.536 --> 33:22.161
Give me the fucking gum.

33:22.246 --> 33:24.706
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.

33:25.624 --> 33:28.751
Come on. Show me. Show me.

Show me. Open your mouth.

33:32.464 --> 33:37.218
Open your mouth and show me.
Show me. Open your mouth.

33:37.302 --> 33:40.430
Open your mouth. That's it.
Show me, like that. Like that.

33:40.514 --> 33:43.307
Come on, you little fuck.
Come on, you little fuck.

33:43.392 --> 33:44.767
Show me. That's it.

33:44.852 --> 33:47.186
You close your eyes
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.

33:47.271 --> 33:48.980
Come on. That's it. You suck it.

33:49.064 --> 33:52.108
You suck it up. You suck it the fuck up.

33:52.192 --> 33:54.485
You suck it up. You like sucking cock?

33:54.570 --> 33:58.406
Come on, baby, show me your mouth.
Show me that fucking mouth.

33:58.490 --> 34:01.159
Show it to me. Yeah, that's it. That's it.

34:01.243 --> 34:02.618
That's it.

34:04.121 --> 34:09.083
Yeah.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.585
You like sucking dick?

34:13.922 --> 34:16.466
You like sucking dick, you little fuck?

34:19.053 --> 34:21.387
You like sucking a fucking dick?

34:21.638 --> 34:23.681
Come on. Open your mouth.

34:23.766 --> 34:27.143
Open your mouth
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.

34:27.226 --> 34:29.978
ln your mouth,
you little fucking cocksucker.

34:30.063 --> 34:34.442
You little fucking cocksucker,
take it in your fucking mouth.

34:34.525 --> 34:35.777
Come on.

34:41.617 --> 34:44.284
Open up and take that fucking scum.

34:44.369 --> 34:46.120
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

35:15.150 --> 35:17.026
lt's okay. He's gone.

35:27.496 --> 35:28.746
Let's go.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.136
Go gently with her.

40:04.940 --> 40:09.652
Sister, l can't imagine
how you feel right now,

40:11.071 --> 40:12.863
but it's very important that we learn

40:12.948 --> 40:15.908
as much about what happened as possible

40:15.992 --> 40:19.620
so we can get this information out
over the police radio.

40:21.123 --> 40:23.874
What can you tell me
about what happened?

40:25.710 --> 40:28.629
Can you tell me
how many of them there were?

40:30.590 --> 40:32.466
Can you tell me what color they were?

40:32.551 --> 40:35.970
Were they black? Were they white?
Were they Hispanic?

40:37.305 --> 40:39.765
Can you tell me how old they were?

40:43.478 --> 40:45.729
Was one older than the other?

40:49.443 --> 40:51.360
There were two of them.

40:51.862 --> 40:53.737
Two young men.

40:55.824 --> 40:58.242
What can you tell me
about the older of the two?

41:01.163 --> 41:04.290
Were there any distinguishing marks
or tattoos?

41:04.583 --> 41:05.958
An earring?

41:08.837 --> 41:10.421
Did he have a beard or a mustache?

41:14.759 --> 41:17.178
Can you tell me how they were dressed?

41:19.347 --> 41:20.848
Sister, l know this is difficult,

41:20.932 --> 41:24.435
but l can't emphasize how important it is.

41:27.981 --> 41:30.900
The sooner we can get this information
out over the...

41:30.984 --> 41:33.486
Here it is, baII two from Franco,

41:33.570 --> 41:35.696
and John Franco is struggling.

41:35.780 --> 41:37.406
He walked Carlos Hernandez.

41:37.491 --> 41:39.742
He got behind on Scioscia, who singled.

41:39.826 --> 41:43.412
He got behind on Butler, who lined out.
lt's now 2 and 0.

41:43.497 --> 41:46.081
-Daniels in a game situation here.
-Come on, Daniels.

41:46.166 --> 41:49.585
If he can work his way aboard,
then the load falls once again

41:49.669 --> 41:52.796
to Darryl Strawberry,
as he has a chance to play hero

41:52.881 --> 41:56.509
once again for the Dodgers,
but it's up to Daniels at this point.

41:56.593 --> 41:58.093
-From the stretch...
-Come on, Daniels.

41:58.178 --> 41:59.261
Ball three!

41:59.346 --> 42:02.223
Good eyes, good eyes.
Take it. Take your next one.

42:02.307 --> 42:04.266
...a 3-0 count now.

42:04.351 --> 42:09.522
Daniels with Strawberry on deck.
Strawberry already with three hits tonight.

42:09.606 --> 42:12.942
Two to nothing ballgame, ninth inning,
and there's a strike.

42:13.026 --> 42:14.735
Three and one the count, as DanieIs...

42:14.819 --> 42:17.071
All right, all right.
Good move. Take the pitch.

42:17.155 --> 42:18.906
-Eyes, eyes.
-Three and one.

42:18.990 --> 42:20.783
Come on, Daniels. Eyes.
Use your fucking eyes.

42:20.867 --> 42:22.034
Two on, one out.

42:22.118 --> 42:23.494
Here's the 3-1 pitch.

42:23.578 --> 42:25.371
Ground ball to short. Could be two.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.248
Flipped to second for one, relay to first.

42:27.332 --> 42:29.625
-It's a double play!
-You cocksucker!

42:29.709 --> 42:32.378
You fucking miserable fucking cocksucker!

42:47.435 --> 42:49.311
Piece of fucking shit!

42:50.355 --> 42:53.023
You fucking nigger! Fucking cocksucker!

43:04.619 --> 43:07.162
You fucking piece of shit!

43:15.630 --> 43:26.724
-The body of Christ.
-Body of Christ.

43:26.808 --> 43:29.560
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.

43:29.978 --> 43:32.605
The body of Christ.

43:34.107 --> 43:36.483
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.

43:37.902 --> 43:44.533
The body of Christ.

43:44.618 --> 43:46.619
Congratulations, asshole.

43:47.495 --> 43:50.873
Now you owe him 30,000.
Now what are you going to do?

43:50.957 --> 43:52.958
l'm gonna go double or nothing
on the next game.

43:53.043 --> 43:54.501
Double or nothing?

43:54.586 --> 43:57.254
Come on, what are you,
out of your mind or what?

43:57.339 --> 44:00.174
There's no way l'm gonna let
that bastard take my money.

44:00.258 --> 44:01.842
Take your money? Really?

44:01.926 --> 44:06.347
This guy's going to blow your house up
with you and everybody else in it.

44:06.431 --> 44:08.223
There's no way LA's
going to lose this game.

44:08.308 --> 44:12.061
They're playing at home.
Strawberry's ready to break out.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.064
Fuck Strawberry.

44:15.148 --> 44:17.483
You're gonna wind up
owing this maniac 60,000.

44:17.567 --> 44:20.194
lt's my business. Just place the bet.

44:21.154 --> 44:23.697
-Body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.

44:24.866 --> 44:36.794
The body of Christ.

44:38.296 --> 44:40.881
-The body of Christ.
-Body of Christ.

44:41.800 --> 44:43.217
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.

44:44.135 --> 44:45.594
Those boys...

44:46.471 --> 44:49.056
Those sad, raging boys.

44:51.810 --> 44:54.186
They came to me as the needy do,

44:55.105 --> 44:57.981
and like many of the needy, they were rude.

44:59.067 --> 45:01.360
Like all the needy, they took.

45:02.570 --> 45:05.030
And like all the needy, they needed.

45:07.826 --> 45:10.285
Father, l knew them.

45:11.830 --> 45:16.166
They learn in our school,
and they play in our schoolyard,

45:16.251 --> 45:18.168
and they are good boys.

45:18.586 --> 45:20.129
You knew them?

45:22.048 --> 45:23.841
Who are they, Sister?

45:25.135 --> 45:26.802
Who are the boys?

45:27.095 --> 45:30.931
What are their names, the names of these

45:32.851 --> 45:34.560
good boys you knew?

45:35.770 --> 45:38.355
l could tell you their names now,

45:38.440 --> 45:41.191
and l know you are bound by a sacred vow

45:42.110 --> 45:43.777
to keep my secret,

45:44.279 --> 45:46.238
but l cannot tell you their names,

45:47.115 --> 45:48.949
for l, too, am bound.

45:51.244 --> 45:53.370
Jesus turned water to wine.

45:55.123 --> 45:58.709
l ought to have turned bitter semen
into fertile sperm,

45:59.544 --> 46:01.211
hatred to love,

46:03.631 --> 46:05.799
and maybe to have saved their souls.

46:06.426 --> 46:10.971
They did not love me,
but l ought to have loved them.

46:11.973 --> 46:14.641
For Jesus loved those who reviled him,

46:16.811 --> 46:19.146
and never again shall l encounter two boys

46:19.230 --> 46:21.565
whose prayer was more poignant,

46:22.317 --> 46:25.778
more legible, more anguished.

48:24.606 --> 48:28.817
Sid Fernandez and Darryl Strawberry,
a battle of wits and talent here

48:29.110 --> 48:31.945
in the bottom of the ninth in Los Angeles.

48:33.740 --> 48:35.824
Strawberry readies himself.

48:36.618 --> 48:38.702
Fernandez checks for the sign.

48:38.786 --> 48:41.663
The pitch on the way. Swinging. Strike one.

48:42.540 --> 48:44.291
One and one on Strawberry,

48:44.375 --> 48:48.503
as Fernandez came in with that fast baII,
and Darryl could not connect.

48:48.588 --> 48:50.130
One and one the count.

48:50.256 --> 48:51.840
Two outs. Bottom of the ninth.

48:51.925 --> 48:54.885
For Los Angeles, men on second and third.

48:54.969 --> 48:57.596
The Dodgers find themselves down by three

48:57.680 --> 49:00.641
and in need
of one of those Darryl moon shots.

49:01.309 --> 49:03.769
The 1-1 pitch from Fernandez.

49:03.853 --> 49:07.314
Swinging. Foul ball.
Off to the third base side.

49:08.066 --> 49:13.070
One and two the count to Strawberry now
as he once again walks around,

49:13.154 --> 49:17.366
thinks about what he might see
on this next pitch from Sid Fernandez.

49:18.868 --> 49:20.869
One and two to Strawberry.

49:24.082 --> 49:28.335
New York Mets trying to do something
that no other team has ever done,

49:28.836 --> 49:32.756
come back from a three-nothing deficit
in a best of seven series.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.635
Strawberry is ready. So is Fernandez.
Ease to the belt.

49:36.719 --> 49:39.054
The 1-2 pitch to Strawberry.

49:40.264 --> 49:41.974
On the way.

49:42.058 --> 49:45.185
High and outside, it's now 2-2.

49:46.521 --> 49:48.981
So the string runs a little bit longer.

49:49.065 --> 49:54.027
The tension builds here in Los Angeles
as Strawberry and Fernandez battle.

49:54.112 --> 49:55.862
Dodgers trying to eliminate the Mets.

49:56.280 --> 50:00.951
The Mets trying hard to send this series
to a seventh and final game.

50:01.244 --> 50:03.996
Fernandez wants to change baseballs now.

50:05.206 --> 50:07.874
He gets another one back
from the home plate umpire.

50:07.959 --> 50:10.877
It's now a 2-2 count in a game situation.

50:11.504 --> 50:13.839
Once again, no team has ever come back

50:13.923 --> 50:16.967
from a 3-0 deficit
to come back and win a series.

50:17.051 --> 50:19.428
That's what the Mets are trying
to accomplish here.

50:19.512 --> 50:22.681
Strawberry, with that big year this year
for the Dodgers,

50:22.765 --> 50:25.976
trying to continue his hot hitting
in this playoff.

50:26.060 --> 50:30.230
So it's lefty against lefty,
old teammate against old teammate.

50:31.065 --> 50:32.607
Strawberry steps in.

50:33.067 --> 50:35.068
Fernandez to the stretch.

50:35.611 --> 50:36.945
The pitch.

50:37.905 --> 50:39.823
He goes around... Did he go around?

50:40.074 --> 50:41.158
The appeal at third. Yes!

50:41.242 --> 50:45.328
Darryl Strawberry,
on the check-swing, goes too far.

50:45.413 --> 50:46.913
He strikes out.

50:46.998 --> 50:50.709
This game is over,
as Strawberry goes down looking,

50:51.044 --> 50:54.629
and the Dodgers are looking at a Mets team
that has tied the series at three.

50:54.714 --> 50:57.132
Oh, what drama on a 3-2 pitch.

50:57.216 --> 50:58.258
And a third base umpire said,

50:59.343 --> 51:01.219
"Yes, sir, he did go around."

51:01.304 --> 51:05.599
And the expression
on Darryl Strawberry's face says it all.

51:05.683 --> 51:07.684
We're tied at three games apiece,

51:07.769 --> 51:10.729
and the Mets win 8-5.

51:11.189 --> 51:14.149
This sets the scene
for one heck of a seventh game.

51:14.233 --> 51:17.194
Pitching-wise,
it's a match made in a fan's dream.

51:17.278 --> 51:21.406
lmagine, one game, and it's Dwight Gooden
against Orel Hershiser.

51:21.491 --> 51:24.159
Neither pitcher is as powerful
as he once was.

51:24.243 --> 51:26.912
Some of their magic removed
by a surgeon's knife.

51:26.996 --> 51:30.707
But they are still pressure pitchers
who know how to get it done,

51:30.792 --> 51:32.834
possibly two future Hall of Famers.

51:32.919 --> 51:35.837
And Game 7 certainly looks like a game...

51:38.007 --> 51:39.925
l can't help you.

51:43.471 --> 51:47.974
Hey. About time.
He finally shows up. Jesus Christ.

51:54.649 --> 51:56.149
Hey. Yo, Lieu!

51:57.318 --> 51:58.652
Come here.

52:01.864 --> 52:04.866
Hey, how you doing?
l never fucking thought you'd be here.

52:04.951 --> 52:07.244
-How's it going?
-Fucking great.

52:09.497 --> 52:11.248
The world is yours.

52:13.501 --> 52:16.169
Hey, Tommy, can l have some drink tickets?

52:38.526 --> 52:40.652
lt's not like the old days.

52:52.039 --> 52:53.373
Hello, fellas.

52:57.378 --> 52:59.171
Yeah, Papa.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.150
Move it!

53:31.871 --> 53:33.830
Help yourself out, okay?

53:40.296 --> 53:42.214
lf you're doing a hit, do a monster.

53:42.298 --> 53:44.424
-Come on. Here. Do a line.
-Hey.

53:44.508 --> 53:46.843
Come on. Did you have...
How many drinks did you have?

53:46.928 --> 53:48.053
Good.

54:09.283 --> 54:11.159
Hey, you got the money?

54:13.537 --> 54:14.913
What money?

54:15.581 --> 54:18.500
Stop fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

54:18.584 --> 54:21.461
-Got it with you?
-l don't got it. Not tonight.

54:23.506 --> 54:24.756
You can't get blood from a stone.

54:25.675 --> 54:27.842
Quit fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?

54:27.927 --> 54:31.388
Come on. This ain't no
fucking joke anymore, seriously.

54:33.057 --> 54:35.684
Just put $1 20,000 on tomorrow's game.

54:36.102 --> 54:38.895
-You're a fucking joke. You know that?
-Sweetheart.

54:39.313 --> 54:40.855
You make me laugh.

54:40.940 --> 54:44.442
-Can l get a vodka on the rocks?
-He's been waiting since the game ended.

54:44.527 --> 54:47.612
You got me waiting here three hours
like a fucking moron.

54:47.697 --> 54:51.074
What is this,
a fucking big game or something with you?

54:53.911 --> 54:55.537
l'm going to win.

54:57.290 --> 54:59.666
You just make sure the fucking bet's in.

54:59.750 --> 55:01.209
You know, l told you once before

55:01.294 --> 55:03.753
that this guy will come by your house
and blow your house up

55:03.838 --> 55:05.588
with your wife and kids and everybody in it.

55:05.673 --> 55:07.299
-You know that, right?
-Good. Good.

55:07.383 --> 55:10.218
l'll give him an extra 1 0 grand
for his trouble.

55:10.303 --> 55:11.803
-l hate that fucking house.
-Yeah?

55:11.887 --> 55:14.347
What do you think, maybe because
you're a cop he won't kill you?

55:14.432 --> 55:16.016
You're this close already to death.

55:16.225 --> 55:19.644
Hey, l've been dodging fucking bullets
since l was 14.

55:19.729 --> 55:21.479
No one can kill me.

55:21.856 --> 55:23.273
l'm blessed.

55:24.233 --> 55:26.151
l'm a fucking Catholic.

55:28.696 --> 55:30.530
How's the case going?

55:34.535 --> 55:36.745
-What case?
-What case?

55:36.829 --> 55:38.872
The case with the $50,000 reward.

55:38.956 --> 55:40.123
Remember?

55:40.207 --> 55:43.877
Yeah. We're on it big time. Lots of leads.

55:47.214 --> 55:49.341
You can use that 50
to get yourself out of this hole.

55:49.800 --> 55:53.386
The Dodgers are going to win the series.

55:53.471 --> 55:55.597
lt's a fucking lock.

55:55.681 --> 55:59.267
Get this, man. l was at the game today,

56:00.061 --> 56:02.729
face-to-fucking-face with Strawberry.

56:03.731 --> 56:05.190
And... And...

56:06.859 --> 56:11.488
And l knew that he struck out on purpose,

56:13.532 --> 56:16.826
and that he's saving it up
for the big one tomorrow.

56:18.079 --> 56:20.330
Today, for the first time, l understood that...

56:20.414 --> 56:22.040
You're sick in the fucking head.
You know that?

56:22.124 --> 56:25.960
That it never could have gone
any other way.

56:28.547 --> 56:31.049
Never could have gone any other way.

56:33.427 --> 56:36.054
So, you just better put in my fucking bet.

56:36.138 --> 56:39.849
$1 20,000 on the last game, the big one.

56:40.559 --> 56:42.268
Come on. You a bookmaker fuck or what?

56:42.353 --> 56:44.354
You know, l'll tell you the truth,
be honest with you.

56:44.438 --> 56:45.897
l'm fed up with this.

56:45.981 --> 56:48.316
Here. l'm going to give you
this guy's number.

56:48.401 --> 56:51.694
You call him yourself.
You tell him what the fuck you want.

56:51.779 --> 56:54.072
Put your own bets in from now on.

56:54.156 --> 56:55.323
Judas.

56:56.826 --> 56:59.244
-You leaving the sinking ship?
-Here. Take that.

56:59.328 --> 57:02.705
Yeah, l'll give you a sinking ship.
lt ain't no joke.

57:02.998 --> 57:05.708
Tell me something. You couldn't pay 60.

57:06.335 --> 57:09.212
You lose, you'll be in for 1 20

57:09.296 --> 57:11.631
to a fucking dago
who'll kill you for nothing.

57:11.715 --> 57:13.466
Yeah. Keep laughing.

57:18.973 --> 57:21.724
You're supposed to cover that,
you didn't even have the 60.

57:23.436 --> 57:24.936
lt's now 1 :00.

57:26.063 --> 57:27.730
Better be careful.

58:15.613 --> 58:17.947
Hey, what's up, man? Come on in.

58:21.035 --> 58:23.953
How you feeling, man?
Come on in. Come on in.

58:24.663 --> 58:27.499
Come on, come on.
Eat something. lt's dinnertime. Come on.

58:27.583 --> 58:30.585
You have to help your sister
with her homework. Come on. Hurry it up.

58:30.669 --> 58:32.003
Excuse me.

58:32.087 --> 58:36.216
Make yourself at home.
Make yourself at home. Sit down.

58:43.307 --> 58:44.849
l know, l know.

58:46.060 --> 58:50.855
Fourteen across is a three-letter word.
$30. Passing fancy.

58:50.940 --> 58:52.023
-Fad.
-Fad?

58:52.107 --> 58:53.733
-Would you please spell it, please?
-F-A-D.

58:53.817 --> 58:55.860
-Are you sure?
-l think so.

58:56.695 --> 58:58.446
All right. Continue.

58:58.989 --> 59:00.949
Number 17 across.

59:01.033 --> 59:05.912
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.

59:06.080 --> 59:09.707
This is a fluffy mass, as in smoke.

59:09.792 --> 59:13.336
A fluffy mass, as smoke.

59:13.921 --> 59:17.048
The clock's running.
Remember, you can use your scratch sheet.

59:17.132 --> 59:18.258
You can confer with one another,

59:18.342 --> 59:20.593
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.

59:20.678 --> 59:22.178
Because it sometimes helps.

59:22.846 --> 59:25.640
Fluffy mess... I'm sorry. It goes to Team B.

59:25.724 --> 59:28.059
You, too, can use your scratch sheet,

59:28.143 --> 59:30.270
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.

59:30.354 --> 59:32.021
Dodgers are going to win tomorrow.

59:32.106 --> 59:33.523
Yes, l know.

59:34.191 --> 59:38.861
A five-letter word. $50.
The last movement of a sonata.

59:38.946 --> 59:40.655
-Rondo.
-Would you spell it?

59:40.739 --> 59:42.240
R-O-N-D-O.

59:42.324 --> 59:44.909
All right. That's absolutely right.
Please go ahead.

59:44.994 --> 59:46.578
Seventeen across.

59:46.662 --> 59:51.958
Seventeen across.
A four-letter word. $40. A fluffy mass.

59:52.042 --> 59:54.043
There's 30 G in there, so be careful.

59:54.128 --> 59:55.753
-Flow?
-Can you spell that?

01:00:00.843 --> 01:00:03.553
-All right, number seven across.
-Seven across.

01:00:03.637 --> 01:00:06.180
Seven across. A three-letter word for $30...

01:00:14.565 --> 01:00:18.151
-All right, seven down.
-Seven down.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:23.990
Give me the definition, in three words,
of a river in central China.

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:27.035
-l know this.
-Central China.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.581
-Fifteen seconds... Ten seconds left.
-Han. H-A-N.

01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:34.834
That's absolutely right, Charlie.
Congratulations.

01:00:34.918 --> 01:00:38.463
-All right, the next choice, please.
-Seventeen across.

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:43.259
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:45.136
This is a fluffy mass,

01:00:45.846 --> 01:00:47.764
as in smoke. A fluffy...

01:00:47.848 --> 01:00:51.017
-Are you going to be all right, man? Yo.
-Yeah.

01:00:53.187 --> 01:00:54.771
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:00:56.065 --> 01:00:58.024
l got it. l got it. l...

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.193
l tell you, man, you better take it easy.

01:01:00.277 --> 01:01:02.362
A fluffy mass... I'm sorry.

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:06.574
You take care, man.

01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:54.302
Large?

01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:57.054
I want my money.

01:04:58.056 --> 01:04:59.807
lt's still my money.

01:05:01.685 --> 01:05:04.937
lf you want a chance
to have any part of it, shithead,

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.899
you will take my bet

01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:13.696
for $1 20,000 on tomorrow's game.

01:05:15.365 --> 01:05:17.575
What about the money you owe me
from yesterday's game?

01:05:17.659 --> 01:05:19.869
Fuck yesterday's game!

01:05:19.953 --> 01:05:23.915
The series is seven games, not six!

01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.336
Put in my bet!

01:05:29.922 --> 01:05:31.672
l'll think about it.

01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:33.758
There's nothing to think about.

01:05:33.842 --> 01:05:37.136
Either you put in my bet,
or you get nothing.

01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:40.306
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:05:41.975 --> 01:05:44.268
Really, l'm no fucking asshole.

01:05:45.103 --> 01:05:46.771
l'm a fucking cop!

01:05:47.189 --> 01:05:51.359
All right. You meet me tomorrow
in front of the Garden, 33rd and 8th.

01:05:51.443 --> 01:05:52.985
You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.

01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:43.345
There we go.

01:08:30.268 --> 01:08:32.144
lt's a beautiful vein.

01:09:02.425 --> 01:09:03.759
All right.

01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:11.559
ln it goes.

01:09:44.216 --> 01:09:47.720
Vampires are lucky.
They can feed on others.

01:09:47.804 --> 01:09:50.139
We got to eat away at ourselves.

01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:55.895
We got to eat our legs
so we got the energy to walk.

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:59.857
We got to come so we can go.

01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:02.401
We got to suck ourselves off.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.656
We got to eat away at ourselves
till there's nothing left but appetite.

01:10:10.619 --> 01:10:12.912
We give and give,

01:10:14.748 --> 01:10:16.582
and give crazy.

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:19.752
You have to give to make sense?
Ain't worth it.

01:10:22.589 --> 01:10:24.757
Jesus said 70 times 7.

01:10:30.305 --> 01:10:32.723
No one will ever understand why...

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:34.475
Why you did it.

01:10:36.311 --> 01:10:37.895
They'll just forget about you tomorrow,

01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:40.564
but you got to do it.

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:43.025
Hershiser leans in for the sign.

01:10:43.109 --> 01:10:46.612
Ease to the belt. His pitch to Bonilla.
BaII, outside.

01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:49.365
Orel Hershiser does not
have his good stuff.

01:10:49.449 --> 01:10:52.034
He has struggled the entire four innings.

01:10:52.118 --> 01:10:53.577
Dwight Gooden leads off third.

01:10:53.662 --> 01:10:56.038
Vince Coleman on first,
dancing back and forth,

01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:57.414
trying to distract Hershiser,

01:10:57.499 --> 01:11:00.876
who's having enough trouble
concentrating on his pitches at this point.

01:11:00.961 --> 01:11:03.545
Ease to the stretch.
Here's the 1-0 pitch to Bonilla,

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.173
and Bonilla rips it down the third base line.

01:11:06.258 --> 01:11:09.551
It's rolling toward the corner.
Gooden scores easily.

01:11:09.636 --> 01:11:11.720
Now the ball's bouncing around
in the corner,

01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:14.765
and Coleman is tearing around third.
He'll score.

01:11:14.849 --> 01:11:18.477
Bonilla around second, holds up,
goes back into second with a double.

01:11:18.561 --> 01:11:21.063
The Mets lead 5 to 0.

01:11:21.648 --> 01:11:22.815
Five to 0, and you got to wonder

01:11:22.899 --> 01:11:25.567
if the Dodgers can ever recover
from this deficit.

01:11:25.652 --> 01:11:27.569
That should be it for Hershiser.

01:11:27.654 --> 01:11:30.656
In fact, Tommy Lasorda's
coming out of the dugout right now.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:34.118
Before he even reaches the mound,
he has motioned to the bullpen,

01:11:34.202 --> 01:11:37.913
and in, in reIief, comes Ramon Martinez.

01:11:37.998 --> 01:11:42.751
Lasorda using every arm he has available
to try and win this series.

01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:45.212
Meanwhile, the game competitor...

01:12:34.888 --> 01:12:36.722
Listen to me, Sister.

01:12:38.933 --> 01:12:40.601
Listen to me good.

01:12:40.894 --> 01:12:45.105
The other cops will just put these guys
through the system.

01:12:47.692 --> 01:12:49.360
They're juveniles.

01:12:49.694 --> 01:12:51.153
They'll walk.

01:12:52.572 --> 01:12:53.781
Get it?

01:12:55.492 --> 01:13:00.496
But l'll beat the system and do justice.

01:13:02.248 --> 01:13:03.749
Real justice.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.211
For you.

01:13:10.256 --> 01:13:12.466
l have already forgiven them.

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.511
Come on, lady.

01:13:16.096 --> 01:13:19.014
These guys put out cigarette butts
on your...

01:13:23.895 --> 01:13:25.646
Get with the program.

01:13:32.737 --> 01:13:34.321
How could you...

01:13:37.242 --> 01:13:39.827
How could you forgive these mother...

01:13:42.247 --> 01:13:44.623
These... These guys? Excuse me.

01:13:48.294 --> 01:13:49.795
How could you?

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:55.634
Deep down inside, don't you want them
to pay for what they did to you?

01:13:57.971 --> 01:14:00.389
Don't you want this crime revenged?

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:07.479
l've forgiven them.

01:14:17.782 --> 01:14:18.949
But...

01:14:20.869 --> 01:14:22.744
Do you have the right?

01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:27.541
You're not the only woman in the world.

01:14:28.543 --> 01:14:30.752
You're not even the only nun.

01:14:33.965 --> 01:14:40.304
Your forgiveness
will leave blood in its wake.

01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:45.726
What if these guys do this to other nuns?

01:14:48.855 --> 01:14:50.355
Other virgins?

01:14:53.026 --> 01:14:55.527
Old women who'll die from the shock?

01:14:57.363 --> 01:15:01.241
Do you have the right
to let these boys go free?

01:15:04.787 --> 01:15:07.122
Can you bear the burden, Sister?

01:15:11.336 --> 01:15:12.836
Talk to Jesus.

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:15.547
Pray.

01:15:21.804 --> 01:15:24.223
You do believe in God, don't you?

01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:32.397
That Jesus Christ died for your sins?

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.645
What?

01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:59.276
You got something
that you want to say to me?

01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:01.445
You fuck.

01:17:02.905 --> 01:17:04.990
You rat-fucker.

01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:06.325
You rat-fuck!

01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:20.505
Here's your...

01:17:30.266 --> 01:17:31.350
What?

01:17:32.226 --> 01:17:35.437
Say something. l know.
You're just standing there.

01:17:46.616 --> 01:17:48.492
What am l going to do?

01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:56.833
You gotta say something!

01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:59.002
Something!

01:18:00.296 --> 01:18:01.380
You fuck!

01:18:01.464 --> 01:18:06.301
You fucking stand there,
and you want me to do every fucking thing?

01:18:07.053 --> 01:18:09.262
Where were you?

01:18:09.555 --> 01:18:12.057
Where the fuck were you?

01:18:12.392 --> 01:18:14.559
Where were you?

01:18:18.022 --> 01:18:20.524
Where the hell were you?

01:18:34.539 --> 01:18:40.752
l...

01:18:44.048 --> 01:18:45.382
l'm sorry.

01:18:46.926 --> 01:18:49.469
l'm so sorry!

01:18:50.722 --> 01:18:52.806
l'm sorry!

01:18:54.183 --> 01:18:57.602
l did so many bad things!

01:18:59.021 --> 01:19:01.022
l'm sorry!

01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:10.657
l tried to do...

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:17.247
l tried to do the right thing,

01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:21.376
but l'm weak. l'm too fucking weak!

01:19:23.838 --> 01:19:26.465
l need you to help me.

01:19:28.134 --> 01:19:29.801
Help me!

01:19:32.597 --> 01:19:35.098
l need you to help me.

01:19:36.434 --> 01:19:41.146
Forgive me.

01:19:42.315 --> 01:19:43.732
Forgive me, please.

01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:46.318
Forgive me, Father.

01:20:18.518 --> 01:20:19.518
Quite a match-up here.

01:20:19.602 --> 01:20:24.439
Ramon Martinez against Howard Johnson,
the power pitcher and the fastball hitter.

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:28.401
Vince Coleman is leading off third base.
Bobby Bonilla off first.

01:20:28.653 --> 01:20:31.196
HoJo has not had much
success against Martinez.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.032
l stole it from my husband's shop

01:20:35.993 --> 01:20:39.120
so's l could return it
to where it ought to be.

01:20:39.622 --> 01:20:41.289
lt's a holy thing.

01:20:41.874 --> 01:20:43.375
A holy thing.

01:20:44.627 --> 01:20:48.004
-Which way is it?
-The boys right across the street there.

01:20:48.089 --> 01:20:50.215
Julio and Paulo.

01:20:50.675 --> 01:20:52.300
lt's a holy thing.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.761
-A holy thing.
-Martinez challenged HoJo

01:20:54.846 --> 01:20:58.431
with his best, his fastbaII, and HoJo set...

01:21:07.233 --> 01:21:09.818
Me, like everybody else, had high hopes
for the Dodger club.

01:21:10.903 --> 01:21:15.574
There's a great deal of talent here,
but theyjust can't seem to keep it together.

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:25.125
Freeze.

01:21:25.626 --> 01:21:27.043
Go ahead
and keep your hands in front of you.

01:21:27.128 --> 01:21:29.379
Keep your hands out in front of you.
Get out of here.

01:21:30.256 --> 01:21:34.718
Way back, it may go. Gone!
A home run for Mike Scioscia.

01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:36.261
You, get out.

01:21:37.013 --> 01:21:40.056
Well, Scioscia seemed to wait on the pitch,
drove it the other way.

01:21:40.141 --> 01:21:43.018
Good piece of hitting
by the Dodger veteran.

01:21:43.102 --> 01:21:45.061
And the remaining Dodger fans,

01:21:45.146 --> 01:21:47.522
well, they finally have something
to cheer about.

01:21:47.607 --> 01:21:52.027
The Dodgers must've been wondering
if they could do anything right today.

01:21:59.952 --> 01:22:01.202
Put them on.

01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:03.288
Lock it.

01:22:15.968 --> 01:22:17.969
-What's your name?
-Julio.

01:22:19.347 --> 01:22:21.348
-What's your name?
-Paulo.

01:22:21.766 --> 01:22:24.392
David Cone is on, in relief,
for the New York Mets.

01:22:24.477 --> 01:22:26.478
Upside and high, ball one.

01:22:26.812 --> 01:22:31.149
Sid Fernandez and Pete Schourek
are both getting ready in the bullpen.

01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:34.778
Cone knows, with this big lead,
he has to throw strikes.

01:22:35.446 --> 01:22:38.531
Here's a pitch on the way,
breaking ball over called strike.

01:22:38.616 --> 01:22:40.825
Jose appeared to be taking...

01:22:42.954 --> 01:22:45.872
Put your hands up there
where l can see them.

01:22:46.624 --> 01:22:51.628
He had a bunt hit in the opening game
of the series.

01:22:56.133 --> 01:22:59.469
And the pitch is thrown outside and high.
Ball two.

01:22:59.553 --> 01:23:03.098
Jose seemed to be swinging away,
but wisely he laid off.

01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:06.017
Now David behind,
and the count two and one.

01:23:06.102 --> 01:23:09.270
Up by seven runs,
David just wants to throw strikes.

01:23:09.355 --> 01:23:12.273
Nothing's been real easy
for either team in the series.

01:23:12.358 --> 01:23:16.069
Cone into the windup. Bunted!
Handled easily, though. Throw to first base.

01:23:16.153 --> 01:23:17.237
Give me a light.

01:23:17.446 --> 01:23:20.782
And now the Mets need just one more out.

01:23:20.866 --> 01:23:23.827
You know, on the replay, you can see
that ball bounce right on the plate,

01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:25.787
making for the easy play.

01:23:25.871 --> 01:23:27.914
A lot like Coleman's hit in the fourth,

01:23:27.999 --> 01:23:31.251
but Coleman's ball must've gone
30 feet in the air.

01:23:31.836 --> 01:23:36.172
Now it's going to be Lenny Harris
representing the Dodgers' final hope.

01:23:36.424 --> 01:23:37.757
Harris, at .225...

01:23:37.842 --> 01:23:38.883
Hold it.

01:23:40.052 --> 01:23:42.053
You want some good shit?

01:23:42.138 --> 01:23:43.471
-Yeah.
-Pitch thrown to Len Harris.

01:23:43.556 --> 01:23:45.390
Swing and a miss. Strike one.

01:23:45.474 --> 01:23:49.352
Harris, like many of these Dodgers,
came out on fire when the series opened,

01:23:49.437 --> 01:23:51.479
but seems to have just disappeared.

01:23:51.564 --> 01:23:55.191
Of course, Met pitching has had a lot to do
with that disappearance.

01:23:55.276 --> 01:23:58.820
In the cIutch,
the Mets pitchers just could not be denied.

01:23:58.904 --> 01:24:02.657
Mets are now all standing
on the dugout steps in anticipation.

01:24:02.742 --> 01:24:04.325
Pitch thrown is ball one.

01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:08.329
Lenny Harris thought about it, he laid off.
And the count's even at one and one.

01:24:08.414 --> 01:24:10.832
At this point, well,
it looks like the Met fans...

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:13.126
Put your hand up there where l can see it.

01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:14.502
...here at Dodger Stadium.

01:24:14.587 --> 01:24:17.547
You can see pockets of Met rooters
aII around the stadium,

01:24:17.631 --> 01:24:19.174
and they're already celebrating.

01:24:19.258 --> 01:24:22.385
Foul ball coming back and out of play.
Now David Cone...

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:24.429
-Give me a light.
-...needs one more strike

01:24:24.513 --> 01:24:28.183
to complete the most amazing comeback
in playoff history.

01:24:28.267 --> 01:24:31.561
I'll never forget the '86 championship
against the Astros,

01:24:31.645 --> 01:24:34.022
but this one has to be the best.

01:24:34.106 --> 01:24:37.317
Everyone, but everyone,
had counted the Mets out,

01:24:37.401 --> 01:24:40.570
and now they're just one strike away
from winning it all.

01:24:40.654 --> 01:24:44.199
You know, this whole thing
is really unbelievable.

01:24:44.283 --> 01:24:48.286
Here we go. One and two the count.
Cone has his sign.

01:24:49.163 --> 01:24:51.206
The windup and the pitch on the way.

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:53.625
Strike three called! The Mets win it.

01:24:54.293 --> 01:24:58.671
Harris doesn't Iike it, but it's aII over.
The Mets have won the championship,

01:24:58.756 --> 01:25:02.008
and the Mets are the first team ever
to come back from a 3-0 deficit

01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:05.887
to win a playoff or a World Series.
The Mets are on the field.

01:25:05.971 --> 01:25:08.723
Jeff Torborg in the middle,
a very happy man.

01:25:08.808 --> 01:25:10.934
What a job he's done for the team.

01:25:11.018 --> 01:25:12.310
-Out the door.
-Dwight Gooden gets the victory

01:25:12.394 --> 01:25:16.231
with an aid and assist from David Cone
in the eighth and ninth innings.

01:25:16.315 --> 01:25:20.610
Well, you can't believe it.
The Mets are going on to the World Series.

01:25:21.737 --> 01:25:22.987
The Mets make history.

01:25:23.072 --> 01:25:26.407
Not only have they won
the National League Championship Series

01:25:26.492 --> 01:25:28.952
with this 8-1 victory over Los Angeles,

01:25:29.036 --> 01:25:32.747
they've become the first team
to come back from the brink of eIimination,

01:25:32.832 --> 01:25:34.415
down three games to none,

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.669
and win the series
by taking four straight games.

01:25:37.753 --> 01:25:41.756
I'd say that that's highly impossible,
but it's possible. They've done it.

01:25:41.841 --> 01:25:46.427
This miracle comeback stands side by side,
in the annaIs of this team,

01:25:46.512 --> 01:25:49.931
with all the exploits
of the 1969 Miracle Mets

01:25:50.015 --> 01:25:54.811
and their World Series Championship,
and the 1986 World Series win over Boston.

01:25:58.023 --> 01:25:59.983
You raped a holy thing.

01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:02.652
You destroyed that young girl,

01:26:03.696 --> 01:26:05.488
and she forgives you.

01:26:07.408 --> 01:26:09.617
You hear that? She forgives you.

01:26:10.035 --> 01:26:11.870
You fucking heroes.

01:26:14.748 --> 01:26:17.709
You like holding her down
and shoving your dick into her

01:26:17.793 --> 01:26:20.336
while she couldn't do nothing about it?
Did you like that?

01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:24.174
Watch this, motherfucker.
Here. Watch this, you cocksucker!

01:26:24.258 --> 01:26:26.885
Look at that.
You can't do a thing about that, can you?

01:26:26.969 --> 01:26:30.388
Can you? Look at me.
Can you? Can you, fuck-face? Can you?

01:26:30.723 --> 01:26:34.350
Go ahead. Move.
Move, you cocksucker. Move.

01:26:34.435 --> 01:26:36.811
l'd like to blow your fucking face apart.

01:26:38.397 --> 01:26:43.193
You fucking scumbags.

01:26:46.488 --> 01:26:48.281
And she forgives you.

01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:53.244
How could she forgive that?

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:58.208
How could she forgive
you slimy little bastards?

01:27:01.962 --> 01:27:04.005
How could she forgive a thing like that?

01:28:06.735 --> 01:28:09.862
All passengers westbound,

01:28:09.947 --> 01:28:14.742
Los Angeles, San Diego, now boarding.

01:28:17.204 --> 01:28:19.080
Attention, passengers.

01:28:19.999 --> 01:28:24.377
Last call for southbound
l-95 Scenic Cruiser.

01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.504
All aboard.

01:28:53.866 --> 01:28:56.784
lf you think you're not getting on this bus,

01:29:01.915 --> 01:29:03.833
you're dead wrong, man.

01:29:10.883 --> 01:29:12.717
There's no fucking way

01:29:13.385 --> 01:29:14.719
that you're going to miss this bus.

01:29:39.912 --> 01:29:42.413
You get on this fucking bus, man,

01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:48.544
'cause your life ain't worth shit in this town.

01:31:47.581 --> 01:31:48.873
Hey, cop!
