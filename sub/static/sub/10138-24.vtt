16:07.049 --> 16:08.968
to that prom.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.348
Well, I would go,

16:11.011 --> 16:14.348
but I think it's too late now.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.892
Even if Duane's cousin was ready

16:15.934 --> 16:17.226
I still don't see how

16:15.934 --> 16:17.226
I am supposed to get

16:17.268 --> 16:20.062
a dress and shoes

16:17.268 --> 16:20.062
and everything by tonight?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.522
Oh, I can help you with that.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.941
I'm a speedy shopper.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.484
When my sister was eloping

16:24.525 --> 16:27.779
I had one hour to get a hairdo,

16:24.525 --> 16:27.779
a dress, and a ladder.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.323
I'll meet you at the car.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.032
- Thanks.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.032
- You're welcome.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.117
See you later, Michelle.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.202
More hugging.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.830
- Bye.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.830
- Bye, sweetie.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.249
Michelle, I have an idea.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.960
Why don't we take

16:40.291 --> 16:41.960
a little look through

16:42.001 --> 16:43.920
the old family photo album, uh?

16:43.962 --> 16:46.130
Why? I wouldn't

16:43.962 --> 16:46.130
remember anything.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.924
Yeah, but let's

16:46.172 --> 16:47.924
just give it a shot.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.884
I-it might help, okay?

16:53.262 --> 16:54.221
Look at you.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.348
That's you.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.766
You're so cute.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.769
Okay, this is you in your

16:56.808 --> 16:59.769
honey bee outfit.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.730
See, it's not easy to pull off

16:59.811 --> 17:02.730
that antenna look.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.482
I don't remember.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.443
Alright.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.903
This was taken

17:07.485 --> 17:08.903
when we went Hawaii.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.656
Nope.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.909
Okay, w-we were all

17:13.574 --> 17:14.909
at Disney World.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.202
You were princess

17:14.951 --> 17:16.202
for a day.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.120
I don't want to see

17:16.243 --> 17:18.120
any more pictures.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.373
I hate this. I can't

17:18.162 --> 17:20.373
remember anything.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.669
I-I know how frustrating

17:22.583 --> 17:24.669
this must be for you.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.086
No, you don't.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.964
You know who you are.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.885
I'm sorry, honey.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.387
I think, maybe we've just been

17:31.926 --> 17:34.387
trying a little too hard.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.431
It's okay.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.431
I'm a little tired.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.933
Maybe I'll take a nap.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.143
Okay.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.815
What are you doing?

17:45.857 --> 17:47.233
Waiting for my hug.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.776
I thought that's what you do in

17:47.274 --> 17:48.776
this house

17:48.818 --> 17:50.820
when you leave a room.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.782

18:08.504 --> 18:10.590
I remember this bed.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.217
I remember it all.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.887
Who are you and why do you

18:13.259 --> 18:15.887
remember everything?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.598
It's my job.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.598
I'm your memory.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.849
Where the heck have you been?

18:19.891 --> 18:22.309
I've been looking

18:19.891 --> 18:22.309
all over for you.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.730
I know. When we fell off the

18:22.351 --> 18:25.730
horse, I got scared.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.231
So I hid.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.901
I hope I didn't 'cause

18:27.273 --> 18:29.901
you any trouble.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.485
Duh.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.488
I've been walking around this

18:31.527 --> 18:34.488
house with an empty head

18:34.530 --> 18:37.533
and hugging people

18:34.530 --> 18:37.533
I hardly even know.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.701
Well, get ready.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.620
Because once they

18:38.743 --> 18:40.620
realize I'm back

18:40.661 --> 18:43.497
they're going

18:40.661 --> 18:43.497
to go hug wild.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.874
Oh, great.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.166
Don't worry.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.002
Once you remember how much

18:46.208 --> 18:48.002
you love them

Please don't ever

18:49.629 --> 18:52.090
leave me again.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.259
I won't.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.259
I promise.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.511
Uh, we're supposed

18:55.301 --> 18:57.511
to hug now.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.973
Why doesn't that

18:57.553 --> 18:59.973
surprise me?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.144

19:03.309 --> 19:05.144

Nicky, Alex, what are you

19:40.138 --> 19:43.933
doing with my Rigby?

19:43.975 --> 19:46.769

19:43.975 --> 19:46.769
you couldn't have him.

Michelle, you remember something

19:51.565 --> 19:54.610
that happened last week?

19:54.652 --> 19:55.987
Why are you talking

19:54.652 --> 19:55.987
to me, Steph?

You said you'd

never forgive me.

Put me down!

Wait, wait, Michelle, come here.

Now this may sound

20:04.328 --> 20:05.496
a little weird

20:05.538 --> 20:07.081
but I wanna put this

20:05.538 --> 20:07.081
to the test.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.958

do I always vacuum the stairs?

This is wonderful.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.609
horse and hit your head.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.069
going to the prom?

Don't worry. I scrounged up

21:18.111 --> 21:20.988

of all of us was missing.
