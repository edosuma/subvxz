<font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:44.545 --> 00:45.580
Are you ready?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.748
Because I want you
to pay attention.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.418
This is the beginning
of something.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.860
Do you have time
to improve your life?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.556
Do you have precisely
30 seconds

00:54.721 --> 00:56.997
for a word
from Accutron Watches?

00:57.157 --> 00:59.034
The watch appears bottom third.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.399
The second hand moves
with a fluid sweep

01:01.562 --> 01:04.042
and above it--
"Accutron Time."

01:04.197 --> 01:06.040
You go into a business meeting.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.941
Is there food in your teeth?
Ashes on your tie?

01:09.102 --> 01:10.547
And you've got nothing to say.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.741
The meeting is boring,
but you can't be.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.852
But you're wearing an Accutron.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.386
This watch makes you interesting.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.785
It's a boardroom.
It's black and white.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.120
We hear light traffic.
No talking.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.627
We just see our man,
you, late 20s,

01:25.786 --> 01:29.131
shaggy with a youthful cowlick,
but in a suit and tie.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.769
This is a businessman
staring at his watch

01:31.925 --> 01:34.769
as muffled conversation
swirls around him.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.068
Now we just hear
the electronic hum.

01:38.231 --> 01:41.576
Omm-mm.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.272
He stands up
and the faces come into view.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.781
A couple of white-haired men

01:45.939 --> 01:48.783
and a contemporary
who looks like Steve McQueen.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.151
You shake hands and "Steve McQueen"
gets a look at your watch.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.155
We hear the first words.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.123
"Is that Swiss?"

01:56.283 --> 01:57.660
Now we're in color

01:57.818 --> 01:59.661
and it's a little interview
for the two of them

01:59.820 --> 02:03.290
while the other men look,
outlining the benefits of this watch.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.267
It is Swiss.
It is accurate.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.964
It is the height of design
and technology.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.111
"Accutron.
It's not a timepiece.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.906
It's a conversation piece."

02:20.273 --> 02:22.412
Wow, Freddy.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.820
That's a home run.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.016
Actually,
it's kind of an end run.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.297
That is not what I expected.

02:32.452 --> 02:33.692
There's a nice way to say that

02:33.854 --> 02:36.300
and there's the way
you just said it.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.595
Well, it's really good.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.830
They're going to resist
that black and white thing.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.304
Yeah, but nobody's done it.
Not that I know of.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.642
"Accutron, it's time
for a conversation."

02:47.801 --> 02:50.645
It's not as dramatic
and it hides the benefit.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.977
I don't know.
It sounds more elegant to me.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.780
Yes?

02:55.942 --> 02:57.819
You wanted me to tell you
when it was five minutes

02:57.978 --> 02:59.286
until the status meeting.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.289
Thank you, Shirley.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.818
So, I'll see you next week.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.554
I'm gonna have
another cup of coffee.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.131
You really put the "free"
in freelancer, don't you?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.813
Ahem. Hello?

03:25.972 --> 03:27.315
Hello, Daddy.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.147
Oh.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.754
How are you, honey?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.186
I'm well.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.326
I thought I'd catch you
before you went to the office.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.484
Right.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.063
I'd like to have brunch
Sunday morning.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.359
Sure.
That'd be nice.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.063
I'll bring vodka.
We'll have Bloody Marys.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.501
No, in a restaurant.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.538
How about the Plaza?
They have vodka.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.040
It'll just be me.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.611
Sounds touching.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.612
10:30.
Bye-bye.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.717
Bye, honey.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.916
I feel like we really
got somewhere last night.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.953
Hello, Dawn.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.395
- Gentlemen.
- The team is here.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.897
Fire when ready.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.637
How long is this meeting?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.034
That depends on you, doesn't it?

04:24.297 --> 04:27.039
Who do we have here?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

04:28.401 --> 04:30.381
That's very hip, Lou.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.881
- Should I get the door, Lou?
- Yes, Nurse.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.387
So, how is everybody today?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.048
Ready for your routine checkup?

04:41.214 --> 04:44.218
Just open your mouths
and say "ahh."

04:52.325 --> 04:53.565
Gentlemen.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.071
Get me those brand reviews.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.072
It's a deadline, knuckleheads!

04:58.231 --> 04:59.574
You know what it says to me?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.144
It says you don't care.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.180
And anybody who doesn't care
doesn't have to work here!

05:09.242 --> 05:11.916
And you do not have the weekend!

05:12.913 --> 05:14.824
- I can come back.
- No.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.360
Clara, can I get a buttered roll,
please, from the lobby?

05:18.518 --> 05:20.293
Yes, of course.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.126
Come on in.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.796
What are you holding?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.272
It's Avon.
You said you wanted to see me.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.933
How many accounts do I have?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.203
Well, it's all of them.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.347
It feels like more.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.382
I'm walking into this office every day
and I barely get ahead of things

05:39.539 --> 05:41.280
before I get Bob from Detroit
around noon

05:41.441 --> 05:43.387
and Pete from LA around 2:00.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.216
Is this Avon related,

05:45.378 --> 05:47.380
or did you just need someone
to hand you a tissue?

05:47.547 --> 05:52.326
I have no real help except Torkelson,
who's Cutler's guy.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.158
And I think he's making
Clara nightly.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.733
- That's juicy.
- He can have her.

05:56.890 --> 06:00.394
The point is Butler Footwear
just hired a new head of marketing

06:00.560 --> 06:02.403
and if I meet with him,
it's a demotion.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.633
You're head of accounts.
He'll think he's important.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.209
That's what it looks like to him.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.972
But to Charles Butler Jr.,
it looks like I'm only as important

06:09.135 --> 06:10.375
as his head of marketing.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.016
If I have no underlings,
I'm useless.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.015
Have Roger or Cutler
meet with him.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.552
That's two dumb ideas.
You're not listening to me.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.917
This is a hierarchy.
Do you understand that?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.021
Tell him I couldn't make it
at the last minute.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.227
I'm having dinner with Jerry Lewis
or GM or somebody.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.835
No, don't mention other clients.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.772
Certainly.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.603
I appreciate
your confidence in me.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.836
- Make him go away.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.242
I have your roll and I have
Bob Benson on the line.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.748
You see this?
I don't have time to take a crap.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.553
And last but not least,

06:52.712 --> 06:54.385
any news from the Motor City?

06:54.547 --> 06:57.756
Chevy XP collateral is scheduled
to go to press Monday.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.762
- Hallelujah.
- But we don't have approved copy.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.400
We don't even have a name for it.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.556
Dang it.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.532
Chevy graphics people
keep telling me

07:05.692 --> 07:07.535
there's a "Chevy way"
of doing things.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.038
- And money is no object.
- Get it in writing.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.572
You didn't pick an angle
for Accutron.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.236
Wow, is that today?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.644
Sure, I did.
Dawn, what did I say?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.310
"Just in time to be on time."

07:22.475 --> 07:25.285
That wasn't one of the choices.
I think that was a digression.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.789
How about
"Accutron is accurate"?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.894
That was one of the choices,
I'm positive.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.496
"It's time for a conversation."

07:32.652 --> 07:34.598
I think that one's more finished.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.825
And I think you're putting me
in a position of saying

07:36.990 --> 07:38.298
I don't care what you think.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.633
Why would you put
something in front of me

07:41.795 --> 07:43.297
that you don't want me to pick?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.602
Because you told me
to give you two ideas.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.472
You apparently only gave me one.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.843
Last week I gave you 30 choices
and you told me to bring you two.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.915
That's the way we do it.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.918

09:05.011 --> 09:07.890
One quick dinner, and the rest
of the weekend we're alone.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.049

- Oh, hey.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.928
Well, hello there.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.467
Why aren't you brown?

09:51.624 --> 09:54.400
- It's January in LA, too.
- That's no excuse.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.040
Oh, Moira, can you
remind me to pick up

09:56.196 --> 09:57.903
two dozen bagels
before the end of my trip?

09:58.064 --> 09:59.873
Aha.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.310
So, the missus misses New York.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.212
No, they are for Pete.
Nan loves California.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.045
Aren't you done
with your adventure?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.415
You know how many times
I've come down here looking for fun?

10:10.577 --> 10:11.647
Isn't Lou fun?

10:11.811 --> 10:14.382
Lou's great.
We just miss you.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.759
Why don't you move
St. Joseph's back another day?

10:18.918 --> 10:20.591
You'll still have time to catch up.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.630
You can come to
the inauguration with me.

10:22.789 --> 10:26.760
I'm supposed to take Sterling,
but say the word, I'll jettison.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.304
Moira, let's start with Chevy.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.463
You're really going to work?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.576
Pencil him in for tomorrow.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.846
"Dream For Sale"
playing in background

10:37.003 --> 10:38.744
That's what I've been saying.

10:38.905 --> 10:42.318
I know. Okay, Ira.
I've got to go.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.579
Hello, Alan.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.484
I'm sorry,
I think I'm a little early.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.924
First actress ever to say that.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.459
You look wonderful, honey.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.257
- Don Draper, this is Alan Silver.
- Don't get up.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.829
The husband is a matinee idol.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.473
I told you.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.337
Don, I want to get one thing
out of the way.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.603
Know that it was important to me

11:07.767 --> 11:10.714
that you know the man your wife
is spending so much time with.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.841
I assure you, it's greed
and nothing else.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.783
I feel completely at ease.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.481
My partners in New York
promise a lot of things to girls

11:20.647 --> 11:21.648
when they come West.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.521
They passed off a lot of dogs.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.527
But your girl is something.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.530
I mean, she's the kind of girl
who's gonna shine for the network

11:29.689 --> 11:31.999
in her callback for
the "Bracken's World" pilot.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.069
What?
Get out of here.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.399
I will not.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.007
I thought the guy hated me.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.836
But his boss loved you.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.671
I'll say one thing about this girl,

11:40.833 --> 11:43.143
she evokes strong feelings.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.250
I feel like I just ate
a bag of butterflies.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.044
Let's celebrate.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.243
Young man.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.720
Let me get a bottle
of French champagne

11:52.879 --> 11:55.382
for my French TV star here.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.858
I can't believe it.
When is it?

11:58.017 --> 12:00.361
Wednesday, 9:15.
We can hold off on fixing your teeth.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.522
Obviously I jumped
the gun on that.

12:02.689 --> 12:03.997
Okay.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.832
What network?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.404
NBC.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.563
Such great news, honey.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.511
Look at you two.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.772
You're my favorite couple.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.922
- Mr. Barnes? Wayne?
- That's me.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.553
I'm Joan Harris from SC&P.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.628
Should I tell them
that we're ready for a table?

12:32.785 --> 12:34.628
Maybe we should wait for Ken.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.630
Please, sit.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.765
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a Coke.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.909
Two Cokes.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.475
I'm so sorry.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.704
Ken was called away
on an emergency

12:48.868 --> 12:50.905
and rather than risk cancelling
on someone so important,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.549
he asked that I stand in.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.946
Look, I must be crazy
to be disappointed.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.452
I'm sure you had a hard time
keeping this seat empty,

12:57.610 --> 12:59.647
but this conversation
is best for Ken.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.094
Tell me about your new position.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.751
Head of marketing.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.625
That's not just new for you,
that's new for Butler Footwear.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.131
They pay me to think
about the four Ps--

13:10.290 --> 13:12.463
price, product, place,
and promotion.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.504
- Thank you.
- That's a smart way to think about it.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.073
I have a degree in business.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.141
It's not a science,
but we try to make it one.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.247
Advertising is just a small piece
of the marketing mixture

13:23.403 --> 13:25.314
and it might be more effective
if it's better integrated

13:25.471 --> 13:26.814
into our business.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.646
So are you thinking
about bringing

13:28.808 --> 13:31.482
one of our account executives
into your office?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.648
Actually, I'd like to move
all our advertising in-house.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.995
It does sound like the conversation
is getting bigger than the two of us.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.296
There's someone above you
and someone below you

13:46.459 --> 13:48.837
and everybody's buying
everybody dinner.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.442
Wouldn't it be cheaper for Mr. Butler
to just walk down the hall?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.272
SC&P's relationship
with Butler Footwear

13:56.436 --> 13:58.211
is very important
to our company.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.181
And I think you're being
shortsighted about our value.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.343
Well, I was hired to be bold.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.785
And I'm prepared
to make my recommendation.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.886
Forgive me, but my wife
will he excited

14:11.050 --> 14:13.690
to have me tuck the kids in
at least once this week.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.026
Certainly, I just--

14:17.690 --> 14:21.035
could you hold off on your
recommendation a few days

14:21.194 --> 14:23.640
so that you can at least have the dinner
you thought you were having?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.798
Sure.
Pleasure to meet you.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.876
You as well.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.307
Excuse me.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.148
Could I get a splash
of whiskey in this?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.593
I'll get the bag.
You go sit down.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.428
Take a quick look.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.903
Then I want to turn off the lights
so you can see the view.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.774
I like what you did with it.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.343
I love it.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.107
But my next house
is gonna have a pool.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.410
Our next house.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.952
Are you sure you don't want to move
into a more populated area?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.716
It's like Dracula's castle up here.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.757
They're far away, Don.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.794
It's just what happens
to the sound in the canyon.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.091
I'm scared, but I don't want
to turn the lights back on.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.734
I'm a little dizzy.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.435
I just-- l need to keep walking
just for a second.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.606
Oh!

15:47.914 --> 15:50.087
I'm sorry.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.593
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.456
Get some rest.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.136
Don, honey.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.280
Please don't flick any cigarettes
off the balcony.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.972
I don't know how,
but everyone says

16:12.138 --> 16:14.140
they can tell
where the fire starts.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.033
Don?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.770
I love my scarf.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.347
I thought with the convertible,
you'd need a few.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.644
It's 9:00 and I have to get to class.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.445
You want me to drop you
at the office?

16:49.609 --> 16:53.284
No, I'll take a cab.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.120
Just don't work all day, okay?

16:56.282 --> 16:59.320
And don't rip the ads
out of my magazines.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.695
Stan, you want coffee?

17:18.003 --> 17:19.415
What are you doing here?

17:19.571 --> 17:22.018
I'm just catching up on all the work
that's been going on.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.585
Looks good.
Lou, he's--

17:23.742 --> 17:26.019
Yes, absolutely.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.886
- So...
- I have a lot to do.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.552
Stan, do you want any coffee?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.322
- Yes.
- What?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.364
He said yes.

17:36.522 --> 17:37.865
Stan!

17:38.024 --> 17:41.005
You don't have to make me any.
I'll he out of here in a minute.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.508
Hey, Ted.
Good to see you.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.268
Hey, Stan.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.434
I thought you'd be tan.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.745
Well, you're in an office here,
you're in an office there.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.747
What's the difference?

17:53.906 --> 17:54.907
You know what?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.247
I'm just going to get my work
and get out of here.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.855
Good to see you guys.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.391
None of this seems
related to coffee.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.027
Buck up, chief.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.933
I'm fine.
It's fine.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.873
You look good.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.952
You look well, too.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.449
Iced tea.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.256
You really branched out
into a new environment.

18:39.418 --> 18:42.126
I did discover it
in a homesick moment.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.894
I flew back New Year's Eve
after a week with my brother

18:45.057 --> 18:48.300
and Christmas with Tammy
and my in-laws.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.407
Sat at the counter by myself

18:50.563 --> 18:52.304
and immediately felt divine.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.445
I'll have a Brooklyn Avenue.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.171
It's a pastrami with the coleslaw
right on the sandwich.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.508
Two of those.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.979
Believe it or not, Brooklyn Avenue
is a street in East Los Angeles.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.851
The New Yorkers here,
they brought as much as we need.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.822
But the bagels are terrible.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.659
Where are you living?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.299
I have an apartment
by the tar pits.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.958
It's one bedroom,
but it's two stories.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.695
Must have quite a view.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.034
The city is flat and ugly
and the air is brown,

19:24.196 --> 19:26.198
but I love the vibrations.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.637
You not only dress like a hippie,
you talk like one.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.341
What have you been up to?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.817
Keeping busy.
You sign anything out here?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.187
Yeah.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.053
The first week I signed
H. Salt Fish and Chips.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.693
Four stores.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.954
Didn't Roger make
an announcement?

19:46.118 --> 19:47.688
I wouldn't know.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.027
Oh, of course.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.228
Listen, you know if it was up to me,
you'd be back there already.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.039
How's Ted?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.541
I noticed you timed it so that you'd
be out here while he was back there.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.543
I came to see my wife.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.545
Yes, of course.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.206
I've been meaning to look her up.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.013
It's incredible, but he's sour.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.886
Maybe he doesn't like the sun.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.323
Last weekend,
middle of January,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.520
Sunkist sent us out
to the groves

20:19.685 --> 20:23.030
and I picked an orange
right off the tree.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.395
It's 75.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.366
There's snow on the mountains.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.563
Ted sat in the car with the door open
writing on a pad.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.277
It's good, isn't it?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.243
So although Beverly Hills
has the patina of show business,

20:39.405 --> 20:41.783
it's really just accountants,
lawyers, and dentists.

20:41.941 --> 20:45.514
And you can walk to lunch,
although I don't.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.089
Very nice.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.453
So this is the chamber of horrors.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.959
And then that's my office.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.698
Well, wonder who that could be.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.599
- Hello there.
- Bonnie Whiteside.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.802
This is Don Draper.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.605
Bonnie's a real estate agent.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.578
She's helping me find
the ideal pad.

21:11.737 --> 21:12.943
What, and leave the tar pits?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.415
It's cute, but he shouldn't
be renting.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.623
Those are some
nice-looking properties.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.252
Where are you living?

21:26.418 --> 21:29.456
I told you, honey,
Don's bicoastal.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.626
I wanted to be by the ocean,
but my wife rented a house in the hills.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.796
- Great view.
- City or valley?

21:37.396 --> 21:38.932
I don't know.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.908
Well, when you're tired
of commuting,

21:42.067 --> 21:43.944
give me a call.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.484
Don't get excited, Don.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.416
She turns it on for everyone.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.482
Ooh!

22:01.587 --> 22:03.658
Professor Podolsky?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.803
Mrs. Harris, I presume?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.199
I appreciate you meeting me
on a Saturday.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.172
Well, the price is right
and the company looks interesting.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.279
What exactly is the company,
by the way?

22:20.439 --> 22:22.851
The client is in footwear.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.318
Shoes, women's.

22:25.477 --> 22:29.186
The new head of marketing
wants to cut costs.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.228
I get it.

22:32.384 --> 22:35.365
It's 20 degrees out there
and the kids are in sandals.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.626
Lowering overhead
is not a bad idea.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.667
Is that where you'd start,

22:39.825 --> 22:41.805
keeping in mind "the four Ps"?

22:41.961 --> 22:43.963
Do you have an MBA?

22:44.129 --> 22:47.042
No, but their head
of marketing does.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.008
These kids.

22:49.168 --> 22:52.308
Believe me, Rockefeller didn't worry
about "the four Ps."

22:52.471 --> 22:55.042
Still, I'm going to need
an argument

22:55.207 --> 22:58.017
and I think it's going to need to be
more technical than that.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.248
I mean, if they're not quitters,
it makes more sense

23:00.412 --> 23:03.393
to diversify their lines
or open foreign offices.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.052
How much to get an analysis
like that in writing?

23:07.219 --> 23:09.825
Well, let's see if you have
anything to trade.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.394
This is a business school.
Doesn't money work here?

23:14.760 --> 23:17.502
I'm doing an advertising
research study.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.007
I wanted to know
what percentage of your clients

23:20.165 --> 23:22.270
work on fees
versus commission.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.339
Oh.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.279
Well, when I started working,

23:29.441 --> 23:31.751
my goodness--
16 years ago,

23:31.911 --> 23:33.913
all of our clients
were on commission.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.424
We started discussing
a fee-based model three years ago.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.585
Now we're at 50-50.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.389
I don't know
if you can answer this,

23:42.554 --> 23:45.125
or even understand it,

23:45.291 --> 23:47.771
but what is the difference?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.100
Actually, I can answer that.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.606
You're going to need another pad.

23:58.804 --> 23:59.805
Hello.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.451
You frying bacon?

24:04.710 --> 24:05.814
It's in the coq au vin.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.720
And I made bread pudding
with blueberries in it for dessert.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.656
Any wine left
or did the chicken drink it all?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.765
I picked you up a bottle.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.797
Better.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.431
I think you have the wrong address.
I don't know--

24:20.592 --> 24:22.299
Fellas, why don't you
put it over there?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.668
Over where?
It's huge.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.470
By the window. There's a wall.
That's where it goes.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.351
- Thank you very much.
- You've got to sign.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.018
Thank you.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.270
Why did you do that?

24:54.426 --> 24:57.373
- You have an antenna on the roof?
- It's huge.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.633
It's the way they make them now.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.003
How's it gonna look, Don?

25:00.165 --> 25:02.372
You know, everyone
I know here is starving.

25:02.534 --> 25:03.672
You're going to be on TV.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.372
Don't you want to watch yourself
in living color?

25:05.537 --> 25:07.539
Don't jinx me.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.387
I didn't know an expensive gift
would upset you.

25:12.544 --> 25:15.525
You're not here
long enough for a fight.

25:21.653 --> 25:22.893
What are you doing up so late?

25:23.055 --> 25:25.695
My mama said to tell you
the toilet's clogged.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.305
Well, she's not supposed
to flush things down it.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.168
She'll know what
I'm talking about.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.810
My mama said some people
just throw it out the window,

25:33.966 --> 25:34.967
but she's not gonna.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.135
You got to fix it.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.679
I'm sorry, Julio,
but l just got home from work.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.908
It's Saturday.
Why you got to work?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.882
You got to fix it!

25:43.042 --> 25:45.181
You could ask nicely.
That might work better.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.756
- She said to yell at you.
- Why?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.415
Because you don't listen.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.561
I don't understand her!

25:55.320 --> 25:58.597
Here. This is yours.
It's a gift. Good night.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.727
"Lost Horizon" score
playing on TV

26:31.256 --> 26:32.929
What is this?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.935
Let's go to bed.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.372
Hey.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.379
Yes?

26:46.538 --> 26:48.108
We haven't celebrated.

26:49.475 --> 26:52.422
Oh, I didn't know
if you wanted to.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.722
I do.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.795
Let me brush my teeth.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.259
Hold on.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.509
Are you okay?

27:59.144 --> 28:01.522
I'm just--

28:01.680 --> 28:03.717
I don't know why I feel nervous.

28:03.882 --> 28:06.328
About this?

28:06.485 --> 28:08.624
About everything.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.826
Don't.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.029
Good morning.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.008
How much time do we have?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.408
I'm on the red-eye.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.785
I hate this.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.251
We have the rest of the day.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.187
I know.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.759
I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.776
Hello.

29:32.037 --> 29:34.108
They saved all the construction
for Sunday.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.776
It's okay, Daddy.
Catch your breath.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.114
It's so good to see you.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.886
Sweetheart, being summoned
makes me nervous.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.120
No, everything is wonderful.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.129
Can you give us a minute?

29:52.257 --> 29:54.259
To the fear of an ambush.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.568
To being together.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.170
What the hell are you up to?

30:05.103 --> 30:06.810
I just wanted to see you

30:06.972 --> 30:09.578
and tell you that it's been
too long and that...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.813
well, when all is said and done,

30:13.979 --> 30:15.424
I forgive you.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.117
That's beautiful to hear.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.660
Because I forgive you, too.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
No, Daddy.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.830
I forgive you.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.627
And I forgive you.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.037
All of your transgressions...

30:32.130 --> 30:34.508
abandoning Mother,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.010
making me ask for money,

30:37.169 --> 30:39.945
your intermittent
interest in Ellery.

30:40.105 --> 30:43.848
I don't even care
that you smell like incense

30:44.009 --> 30:48.890
or have any thoughts about
your current, quote, "state of affairs."

30:49.948 --> 30:53.395
I-- I simply forgive you.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.965
You want me to say I'm sorry?

30:57.122 --> 31:00.365
Because I don't agree
with all that.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.004
Where the hell
is this coming from?

31:02.160 --> 31:05.698
Well, if you must know,
I've been searching.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.368
And with a little help,
I've come to understand

31:09.534 --> 31:12.743
that anger can be
vanquished by love.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.383
Are you going to church?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.678
Not in any way
you'd understand.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.686
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.415
You can't make it better.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.825
So now we're just supposed
to eat eggs Benedict?

31:26.985 --> 31:29.329
I would love that.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.585
Good evening.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.552
Evening.

31:57.182 --> 31:58.957
Thank you.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.727
Do you want a sleeping pill?

32:05.891 --> 32:07.097
No, thank you.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.135
You know what?

32:10.295 --> 32:12.036
Me either.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.803
I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you enjoy flying.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.709
I fly a lot.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.651
And I'm always hoping
I was seated next to,

32:22.808 --> 32:24.310
well, someone like you...

32:26.311 --> 32:28.222
instead of a man with a hairpiece
eating a banana.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.789
But why would I expect
anything else?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.988
You can blame
Madison Avenue for that.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.895
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.776
Where were you?
I was worried.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.969
I thought we hated
all things domestic.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.340
You sound uptight.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.948
Man walks in,
obviously having tied one on,

32:53.104 --> 32:55.414
woman says,
"Where were you?"

32:55.574 --> 32:56.985
Kind of establishment.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.122
Why are you being so mean?

32:59.277 --> 33:00.915
Move over.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.259
Oh, Christ.
Move him over, too.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.694
Is that my vest?

33:09.855 --> 33:12.699
If you were with someone,
I don't care.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.860
You know anyone's welcome
in this bed.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.370
I just want to get some sleep.

33:36.314 --> 33:40.558
I'd like to put this on,
but vanity is preventing me.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.323
You want me to wear mine
so I don't see you?

33:49.561 --> 33:52.565
This is nice.
I usually sleep alone.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.174
What about the man
that gave you that ring?

33:58.336 --> 34:00.748
He passed away.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.909
A year ago, actually.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.851
I was--

34:07.012 --> 34:09.925
he wanted his ashes
scattered at Pebble Beach.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.188
How was that?

34:13.351 --> 34:15.159
I failed.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.358
It's a very popular spot
for such things.

34:18.523 --> 34:22.096
Apparently, they don't want
another sand trap.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.934
I ended up at his second choice.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.371
Disneyland.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.275
Really?

34:32.370 --> 34:35.112
- Have you ever been there?
- I have.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.384
Where is he now?

34:39.543 --> 34:41.956
Tom Sawyer Island.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.791
That's probably
a popular destination, too.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.228
Yes, they were very vigilant.

34:49.387 --> 34:51.297
It took some doing.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.699
How old was he?

34:54.859 --> 34:56.964
He would have been 50.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.541
So, much older?

35:00.699 --> 35:03.703
He worked fast, too.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.811
What happened to him?

35:08.473 --> 35:12.319
He was thirsty.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.718
He died of thirst.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.918
His company sent him
to a hospital.

35:19.084 --> 35:21.496
I went with him.

35:21.653 --> 35:26.602
I was supposed to be
part of the cure somehow.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.134
And all I did was observe.

35:33.431 --> 35:38.505
I thought he was
really getting better.

35:39.904 --> 35:43.181
Then a doctor told me
he'd be dead in a year.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.183
All of them would be.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.771
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.488
Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning.

36:19.644 --> 36:22.318
Despite our best efforts,
we're still stacked up,

36:22.480 --> 36:24.551
but it looks like we're two away.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.026
I think that we'll begin
our descent in 15 minutes.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.324
Sorry, l think I dozed off.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.793
You have a few more minutes.

36:36.961 --> 36:39.965
If I was your wife,
I wouldn't like this.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.314
She knows I'm a terrible husband.

36:47.072 --> 36:50.349
How long have you
been married?

36:50.508 --> 36:52.510
Not long enough.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.359
I really thought
I could do it this time.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.895
- Did she kick you out?
- No.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.364
She doesn't know that much,
but she knows.

37:06.825 --> 37:11.274
Well, if she doesn't know,
you should just keep it that way.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.431
That's what people do.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.042
I keep wondering...

37:21.272 --> 37:23.616
have I broken the vessel?

37:25.744 --> 37:28.418
If you did,
what can you do about it?

37:28.580 --> 37:30.389
It's done.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.536
I bet I could make you
feel better.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.540
I bet you could.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.473
There's a car waiting for me.
I can give you a lift.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.817
I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

38:11.556 --> 38:14.935
Your tenant Mrs. Rodriguez
called again about her toilet.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.800
She was hard to understand,
but I think she said

38:16.961 --> 38:18.440
she's calling the alderman.

38:18.596 --> 38:20.132
Ugh.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.141
Call my sister Anita
and tell her to get Gerry

38:22.300 --> 38:23.506
and his friend
the plumber up there.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.976
- Shouldn't I just call Gerry?
- No.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.343
Anita can ask
her husband, I can't.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.781
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

38:29.941 --> 38:33.013
- How was your weekend?
- Peachy. Cut up some firewood.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.590
I'm sorry about last week.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.423
You're right that I shouldn't have
suggested something I didn't like.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.587
I never gave it another thought.

38:44.355 --> 38:48.326
Well, I did and I realized
that Freddy's original idea

38:48.493 --> 38:50.131
was the best,
but I didn't do it justice.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.275
What are you doing?
I already said yes.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.205
“Accutron,

38:54.365 --> 38:57.676
it's not a timepiece,
it's a conversation piece."

38:57.836 --> 38:59.281
Forget it.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.044
- Morning.
- Morning, Lou.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.884
This is actually a big idea.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.957
Why are you making this so hard?

39:10.114 --> 39:11.559
Open the door and walk in.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.787
You do not need to parachute in
through the ceiling.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.831
But I don't mind.
l just want to give you my best.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.831
I don't know, Peggy-

39:18.990 --> 39:21.368
I guess I'm immune
to your charms.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.836
Can I get some coffee?

39:29.667 --> 39:31.476
Good morning, Clara.
ls Ken in yet?

39:31.636 --> 39:32.637
No, he's on the plane.

39:32.804 --> 39:36.149
As soon as he lands, I need to speak
with him regarding Butler.

39:36.307 --> 39:39.413
Good for you.
Mr. Butler is coming in this week.

39:39.577 --> 39:40.988
What?

39:41.145 --> 39:43.921
Get Wayne Barnes
on the line-- now.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.862
Mr. Barnes on line three.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.269
Joan?

40:04.602 --> 40:07.412
- You already set a meeting?
- Good morning.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.348
I took you seriously,
but you didn't take me seriously.

40:10.508 --> 40:13.853
Look, I know you're fighting
for your job, but don't get emotional.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.582
I'm fighting for your job.

40:17.882 --> 40:21.193
Okay, well, I appreciate it,
but don't worry about me.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.923
- I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

40:24.088 --> 40:27.399
Let's talk about your in-house
advertising agency.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.539
You think you can go
into a network or a newspaper

40:30.695 --> 40:32.265
with your checkbook
and get the space we get

40:32.430 --> 40:35.434
when we deal with them
every day with 30 clients?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.443
You will be competing
against us,

40:37.602 --> 40:39.377
not against
other shoe companies.

40:39.537 --> 40:42.143
We both know the shoe business
is going to decline

40:42.307 --> 40:43.718
for some time in the future.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.445
If you make a bold move now,

40:45.610 --> 40:48.489
that decline will be
your responsibility.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.717
What are you gonna do then?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.623
You can only fire us once.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.458
So what am I supposed to do?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.156
I already set the meeting.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.392
Cancel it.

40:58.556 --> 41:01.002
No, I'm asking you,

41:01.159 --> 41:03.139
what do I do?

41:07.999 --> 41:10.411
Tell them we cancelled
the meeting.

41:10.568 --> 41:13.674
We need more time to present
a revised media strategy.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.648
- Yes.
- Good.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.788
I'm still expecting to meet with Ken.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.286
I'll follow up on that today.

41:20.445 --> 41:21.856
You'd better.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.159
Did you tell him to prepare
more boards for Accutron?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.361
- Do you want to do it?
- No, I want to do it.

41:35.526 --> 41:38.439
- I don't know what I did.
- Get out of here.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.769
He may be in the art department,
but he reports to me.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.208
We already have boards
for "Accutron is accurate."

41:43.368 --> 41:44.711
You know that's a loser.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.645
I think if he could see both of them,
he'll change his mind.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.716
Or at least let us
show both to the client.

41:49.874 --> 41:51.979
Let it go, baby.
It's dead.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.350
No, l just don't think he's given it
the proper thought.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.685
You're telling your boss
you think he's stupid.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.725
Well, I'm tired of fighting
for everything to be better.

41:58.883 --> 42:00.988
You're all a bunch of hacks
who are perfectly happy with shit.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.995
Nobody cares about anything.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.395
No one wants things
to be better, I got it.

42:05.556 --> 42:08.127
I'll just stand out here
all by myself.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.843
We find ourselves rich in goods,
but ragged in spirit--

42:17.001 --> 42:20.175
reaching with magnificent precision
for the moon,

42:20.338 --> 42:23.182
but falling into
raucous discord on Earth.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.582
We are caught in war
wanting peace.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.087
We're torn by division
wanting unity.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.420
We see around us empty lives
wanting fulfillment.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.584
We see tasks that need doing...

42:33.751 --> 42:36.425
- Come in.
- ...waiting for hands to do them.

42:40.158 --> 42:42.331
You know I'm breaking a rule here.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.769
I haven't had one of these
sausages since I quit.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.840
If this makes me
have dreams about beer,

42:46.998 --> 42:48.500
I'm gonna be mad at you.

42:51.869 --> 42:54.008
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.243
I should be paying you.

42:56.407 --> 42:59.786
You want that balcony door open?
It's freezing outside.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.593
Peggy went bananas
for your Accutron work.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.096
Of course she lifted her leg on it.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.965
Also, I swang by
J. Walter Thompson,

43:13.124 --> 43:15.297
thinking there was an emergency
with our copy for 7-Up.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.804
- You want a sweater?
- Nah.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.643
Turns out they're looking
for help on Oscar Mayer.

43:23.267 --> 43:26.146
You are making quite a name
for me out there.

43:26.304 --> 43:29.114
Bologna? Hot dogs?
It's moms and kids either way.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.877
Why don't you stop this Cyrano bit

43:31.042 --> 43:32.988
and march your ass in there
and get us both a job?

43:33.144 --> 43:34.714
Because I have a job.

43:34.879 --> 43:36.654
It's been two months.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.393
Nobody's called, right?

43:39.550 --> 43:40.995
I'm still being paid.

43:41.152 --> 43:43.291
Well, they had Christmas
without you.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.957
The Super Bowl.
Pretty soon it's gonna be Easter.

43:47.425 --> 43:49.234
You know, I've been there.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.339
You don't want
to be damaged goods.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.350
I tried to get a hold of you.

44:03.508 --> 44:06.114
Why? I spoke to Clara.
Thank you for solving that problem.

44:06.277 --> 44:09.087
I bailed it out,
but I think it's irreparable.

44:09.247 --> 44:11.124
It's only a matter of time
before we lose it.

44:11.282 --> 44:14.126
Every account man who's ever come
into my office has said that.

44:14.285 --> 44:15.855
But they haven't all
left one of these.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.525
- Oh.
- Stay out of my office.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.881
Sorry.

44:38.042 --> 44:39.453
I dozed off.

44:39.610 --> 44:42.386
Well, Jimmy says he'll be back
in the morning.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.857
He needed a part.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.053
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

44:47.218 --> 44:50.199
It seems silly for you to go all the way
out to Brooklyn and come back.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.698
It won't take long
this time of night.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.736
Are you sure?

44:56.894 --> 44:59.465
I don't like Anita there
alone in the house.

45:00.565 --> 45:02.238
Of course.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.846
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.
