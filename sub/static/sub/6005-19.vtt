that he could help me with.

Alvey will never be his bitch.

I think it's a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

you don't perform, you're out.

You got to tell Alvey today.

from someone else.

and I fucking... I love being here.

31:11.344 --> 31:11.944
Well, we... I don't...

31:11.978 --> 31:13.787
We love having you.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.947
Come on. You know I'm a pain in the ass.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.684
You think any of these fighters
are a day at the beach?

31:22.154 --> 31:23.259
Your mind made up?

31:25.390 --> 31:28.293
[Sobs softly]

31:28.697 --> 31:29.828
Yeah.

31:31.979 --> 31:32.765
I'm sorry.

31:32.832 --> 31:34.367
Ah, it's okay.

31:35.123 --> 31:36.002
Let me tell you something.

31:36.035 --> 31:37.803
You think you're
the first fighter to leave me?

31:38.170 --> 31:39.237
Hmm? You know how many
fucking tough guys

31:39.238 --> 31:41.307
sat on that couch, tears in their eyes,

31:41.374 --> 31:43.076
trying to nut up, tell me they're gone?

31:44.610 --> 31:45.777
I tell them all the same thing.

31:46.355 --> 31:48.781
This place, my team,
it's not for everyone.

31:49.715 --> 31:51.383
Sometimes it's just not a fit,

31:51.450 --> 31:52.732
you know, that's the way it goes.

31:54.858 --> 31:56.370
I don't feel that way about you.

31:56.656 --> 31:57.708
I love coaching you.

31:58.591 --> 31:59.899
I love watching you train.

32:00.923 --> 32:02.395
You're very talented.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.665
And you are as fucked up as I am.

32:05.731 --> 32:07.533
[Laughs]

32:07.566 --> 32:09.099
[Sniffles]

32:10.536 --> 32:12.029
But there's one fucking thing I know.

32:12.852 --> 32:15.131
This business will always
turn its back on you,

32:15.787 --> 32:17.971
so you need people in your life
that never will.

32:19.747 --> 32:21.235
And that's what I am for you.

32:23.059 --> 32:25.217
We're family. Okay?

32:25.620 --> 32:27.153
My door, it's always open.

32:27.219 --> 32:30.493
Always. Do you understand that?

32:31.290 --> 32:32.308
Yeah?

32:33.159 --> 32:34.319
- Thank you, Coach.
- Okay.

32:34.386 --> 32:37.492
I mean, for... for everything.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.277
I was nothing before I came here.

32:42.101 --> 32:43.173
It's okay.

32:45.021 --> 32:46.238
We'll miss you.

32:46.305 --> 32:47.428
[Sobs]

32:49.996 --> 32:51.772
You take some time in here, all right?

32:52.777 --> 32:54.212
I'll be around all day,
you want to talk to me.

32:54.279 --> 32:55.181
Thank you.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.545
You're welcome.

32:57.256 --> 32:58.369
You're all right.

33:02.788 --> 33:04.457
[Sighs]

33:09.938 --> 33:12.665
Ahhhh!

33:14.250 --> 33:16.469
[Clears throat]

33:16.535 --> 33:19.004
You don't give a shit
about this fight, do you?

33:23.354 --> 33:26.834
You know, I tried giving a shit
once, and it just...

33:27.813 --> 33:29.178
did not feel good.

33:29.615 --> 33:31.150
[Chuckles]

33:31.578 --> 33:33.451
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:34.436 --> 33:36.288
It's nice to see you drinking again.

33:36.355 --> 33:37.757
It's really good to be back.

33:37.823 --> 33:39.986
Been missing my jogging partner.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.547
[Laughs]

33:47.566 --> 33:49.064
What's going on with you?

33:50.534 --> 33:52.705
Won two title fights,
and I thought you'd be happy.

33:52.772 --> 33:54.711
Yeah.

33:56.108 --> 33:57.510
Well, I thought I would, too.

33:57.576 --> 33:59.166
So, why aren't you?

34:02.381 --> 34:05.174
Well, I thought my life
would be different somehow,

34:07.105 --> 34:08.597
that things would change.

34:09.388 --> 34:11.056
But nothing's different, you know?

34:11.389 --> 34:13.239
Not a fucking thing came my way.

34:13.306 --> 34:15.795
Okay, fine, well, I'm back now.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.329
Okay, and I can get you sponsors,

34:17.396 --> 34:20.266
but you have to keep the fucking
needle out of your arm.

34:20.331 --> 34:21.944
- Oh, I'm done with that.
- You promise?

34:28.761 --> 34:29.900
Hey.

34:39.456 --> 34:40.639
Moving on...

34:41.712 --> 34:43.880
Would you like to do this again?

34:45.090 --> 34:47.217
I would like to keep them coming, yes.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.560
Okay.

35:03.549 --> 35:05.503
Whiskey-ginger, please.

35:08.714 --> 35:10.222
Keep the tab open.

35:16.922 --> 35:19.058
I think that's it.

35:19.125 --> 35:21.327
All right, let me see.

35:21.393 --> 35:24.007
Oh. Fucking bullshit day.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.399
What happened?

35:30.269 --> 35:31.670
I lost a fighter.

35:32.494 --> 35:33.894
Oh, you missed one.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.743
This.

35:39.089 --> 35:40.411
Who was it?

35:40.479 --> 35:41.495
Alicia.

35:42.081 --> 35:43.215
Oh, shit.

35:43.282 --> 35:45.019
- Yeah.
- I liked her.

35:46.346 --> 35:48.744
Girl was living in her
fucking car when I met her.

35:51.490 --> 35:54.093
Gave her everything she wanted,
I gave her my fucking time.

35:54.633 --> 35:56.362
I was... I was gentle with her.

35:56.428 --> 35:58.764
I took care of her, I didn't
throw her out into deep water.

35:58.831 --> 36:00.881
Now she's got a fucking career.

36:02.489 --> 36:03.768
Thank you, Alvey.

36:04.370 --> 36:07.299
- [Scoffs]
- Yeah, that's frustrating.

36:09.314 --> 36:10.779
What did you say to her?

36:11.310 --> 36:12.978
Oh, I said I understood her decision,

36:13.045 --> 36:14.647
and that my door was always open.

36:14.713 --> 36:16.849
Oh, yeah? That was nice.

36:16.916 --> 36:18.984
Yeah. Well, anything else would be weak.

36:22.721 --> 36:25.937
But I remember every fucking
fighter that's ever left me.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.874
Even the ones I didn't want.

36:31.730 --> 36:33.743
These fucking people.

36:35.713 --> 36:36.802
They don't know what's important.

36:37.584 --> 36:38.404
They don't know.

36:38.437 --> 36:39.939
You know, she stood in front of me

36:39.972 --> 36:42.369
with fucking tears in her eyes,
telling me how hard this was.

36:43.024 --> 36:44.811
How much I've fucking done for her.

36:44.878 --> 36:46.144
You know, trying to make me
a fuckin' father,

36:46.145 --> 36:47.880
and now she's... now she's out the door

36:47.947 --> 36:49.949
because she's got
her fucking head turned.

36:50.015 --> 36:51.483
Well, good fuckin' luck, sweetheart.

36:51.550 --> 36:53.084
She'll be fuckin'...
She'll have five kids

36:53.085 --> 36:55.588
with three different dudes
before she's fuckin' 30, get...

36:55.621 --> 36:57.178
Alvey, Jesus, that's...

36:57.245 --> 36:58.214
What, that's what?

36:58.239 --> 36:59.158
I mean, that's a little harsh.

36:59.191 --> 37:01.111
That's my fuckin' business.

37:10.236 --> 37:12.638
[Ringtone chiming]

37:18.711 --> 37:20.312
[Sighs]

37:22.448 --> 37:23.657
Hey.

37:24.516 --> 37:25.665
Will: You coming or not?

37:26.385 --> 37:27.853
What? Where?

37:27.920 --> 37:29.655
- I'm at the bar.
- What? What bar?

37:29.722 --> 37:33.559
Uh, the bar that you wanted
to meet me at.

37:33.592 --> 37:34.816
I'm here now.

37:36.002 --> 37:38.797
I... don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

37:39.281 --> 37:41.133
You texted me
that you wanted to meet me.

37:41.664 --> 37:43.269
I didn't text you.

37:43.335 --> 37:44.403
Yes, you fucking did!

37:45.232 --> 37:46.471
Check your phone.

37:46.538 --> 37:48.874
- Will, I didn't text you.
- Oh, my God.

37:48.941 --> 37:50.957
I'll send you the fuckin' thread then.

37:51.429 --> 37:53.462
You know what, Nate, you're a nice guy,

37:53.583 --> 37:55.174
but you're obviously very confused,

37:55.269 --> 37:57.578
and I don't have time
for this in me life right now.

37:58.673 --> 38:00.352
Lose my number, please.

38:05.977 --> 38:07.359
[Scoffs]

38:31.517 --> 38:32.809
You good to drive?

38:32.876 --> 38:35.560
Yep. Licensed and everything.

38:36.568 --> 38:38.723
- Are you good to drive?
- I'm fine to drive.

38:42.644 --> 38:43.802
See, I'm good.

38:43.869 --> 38:45.504
Yeah, you're good. Get going.

38:45.571 --> 38:46.665
[Both laugh]

38:47.299 --> 38:48.801
- Thank you.
- For what?

38:49.565 --> 38:51.822
For making me feel normal tonight.

38:53.138 --> 38:55.474
[Sighs]

38:55.951 --> 38:58.543
Lisa, this is something
that happened to you, all right?

38:58.610 --> 39:00.614
It is not who you are.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.198
Yeah.

39:05.632 --> 39:06.526
I love you.

39:06.592 --> 39:07.885
I love you.

39:08.930 --> 39:09.955
Drive safely, okay?

39:10.022 --> 39:12.414
- You, too.
- I'll be fine.

39:12.481 --> 39:13.892
- I mean it.
- Yeah.

39:13.926 --> 39:15.619
I've had to pick you up from jail

39:15.644 --> 39:17.171
- a couple of times.
- Drive safely.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.129

[Tires squeal]

39:41.166 --> 39:42.901
[Slow rock song plays]

39:51.563 --> 39:52.731
Can I get a shot of whiskey?

39:59.926 --> 40:01.494
Are you drinking alone?

40:03.008 --> 40:04.209
Probably so.

40:06.257 --> 40:07.525
I was supposed to meet someone.

40:07.566 --> 40:08.978
Didn't show up.

40:10.209 --> 40:11.950
So, did I hear an accent?

40:13.022 --> 40:14.715
Yeah, English.

40:14.782 --> 40:16.488
No, United Kingdom.

40:16.522 --> 40:17.756
[Chuckles] That's the one.

40:17.823 --> 40:19.091
Right, yeah.

40:19.158 --> 40:20.406
What's your name?

40:21.616 --> 40:22.694
Will.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.762
Can you close me out?

40:24.830 --> 40:28.358
- And put Will's drinks on my tab.
- Oh, no, no, no.

40:28.425 --> 40:30.782
Mate, I can buy
me own drink, thanks anyway.

40:30.849 --> 40:32.818
No, no, that's nonsense really.

40:32.884 --> 40:35.342
It's... It's really nice to meet you,

40:35.409 --> 40:37.365
and I hope you enjoy your time here

40:37.431 --> 40:39.379
in these United States of America.

40:39.446 --> 40:41.127
- Cheers.
- God save the Queen.

40:41.194 --> 40:42.915
- Ah, fuck the Queen.
- Fuck the Queen?

40:42.981 --> 40:45.984
- Get out of here.
- Fuck the Queen.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.253
- Thanks for the drink.

- Wait a second.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.071
- Hey.
- Hi.

42:13.138 --> 42:14.812
It's, uh... It's kind of late.

42:14.813 --> 42:16.141
What are you doing here?

42:16.208 --> 42:19.564
Uh... I wanted to see you.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.080
Can I come in?

42:25.552 --> 42:27.568
[Whispering] Oh, she's here.

42:29.782 --> 42:31.356
I want to meet her.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.825

Nice to meet you.

42:49.940 --> 42:51.548
Nice to meet you, too.

42:55.733 --> 42:57.249
I'm gonna get my things.

42:57.316 --> 42:58.183
No, you don't have to leave.

42:58.216 --> 42:59.851
No, no, it's, uh... It's okay.

42:59.918 --> 43:02.054
I know you guys have
a lot to talk about, so...

43:07.792 --> 43:09.393
I'll be in the kitchen.

43:17.077 --> 43:20.339
She... is a drunk, so...

43:20.405 --> 43:22.685
Yeah, well, who's not?

43:23.542 --> 43:25.210
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

43:25.277 --> 43:27.144
Okay, I'm gonna to talk to her
and tell her to leave.

43:27.145 --> 43:28.547
No.

43:28.613 --> 43:31.083
Don't to that. I'm going.

43:31.149 --> 43:32.351
Come on.

43:32.417 --> 43:33.418
Come on, what?

43:33.485 --> 43:34.614
What?

43:35.954 --> 43:37.556
Good night.

[Door opens, slams]

43:51.603 --> 43:52.704

43:57.442 --> 43:59.111
She's beautiful.

43:59.664 --> 44:00.976
How old is she?

44:02.268 --> 44:03.315
About my age.

44:05.969 --> 44:08.320
Well, if she's had
any work done, you can't tell.

44:08.387 --> 44:09.754
[Chuckles]

44:10.856 --> 44:12.601
What is it that you want?

44:16.753 --> 44:19.264
I had a question
that I wanted to ask you.

44:19.331 --> 44:21.800
I was gonna call you
from the hotel, but I thought,

44:21.867 --> 44:24.056
you know what, I want to see his face.

44:27.648 --> 44:28.973
What is it?

44:32.144 --> 44:33.864
Why didn't you come get me?

44:37.825 --> 44:39.584
What does that mean, come get you?

44:40.872 --> 44:44.756
When our baby died,
why didn't you come get me?

44:44.823 --> 44:46.393
You didn't want me to.

44:47.885 --> 44:49.975
Are you fucking out of your mind?

44:50.041 --> 44:52.153
Your father called me and said
you didn't want to see me.

44:52.186 --> 44:53.031
My father?

44:53.098 --> 44:54.766
So fucking what?

44:54.833 --> 44:56.963
I was respecting your wishes.

44:58.637 --> 45:03.355
I'm dying, and you're
respecting my wishes?

45:07.986 --> 45:09.580
Did it ever occur to you

45:09.647 --> 45:12.260
that I didn't know
what the fuck I needed?

45:13.684 --> 45:15.027
That maybe...

45:15.921 --> 45:17.956
what I needed was you?

45:25.676 --> 45:26.997
Your father called me...

45:27.065 --> 45:28.867
My father fucking called?!

45:28.934 --> 45:30.268
Who the fuck cares?!
