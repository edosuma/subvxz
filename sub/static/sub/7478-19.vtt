WEBVTT

00:12.470 --> 00:14.344
Now we're talking.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.550
That's her. Hey, right here.

00:19.435 --> 00:21.309
Yo, right here. Yeah.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.021
Now we're talking. Yeah, please.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.347
Right here, baby.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.103
Over here.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.602
Over here. Yeah, yeah.

00:31.155 --> 00:32.186
Over here, Kelli.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.525
Kelli, you're beautiful.
Smile at the camera.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.342
Over here, you look beautiful.
Right here.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.946
Right here, right here.
Beautiful, beautiful. Thank you.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.335
Bupkis.

00:52.301 --> 00:53.630
Hey, Eddie, where are you going?

00:53.803 --> 00:56.638
Snooki from Jersey Shore
is pulling up.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.151
Hey, somebody call 911! Over here!

01:12.989 --> 01:14.613
What the hell?

01:41.893 --> 01:43.517
Okay, shot caller, call your shot.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.355
I'm thinking of new
and innovative ways

01:46.522 --> 01:47.803
to expose your weaknesses.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.642
I have an H. You have an H-O.

01:49.817 --> 01:51.442
Shoot, ho.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.857
Top of the key, off-hand, glass.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.491
That's the same shot as before.

01:57.658 --> 02:00.149
No, this is a bank shot now,
with the off hand.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.739
The key is not to over-think it.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.613
It's a concept I'm sure you'll have
no problem embracing fully.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.618
Same shot twice.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.881
Hey, I don't break the rules.
I just bend them.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.671
Listen, I love the rules.
The letter and the spirit.

02:16.844 --> 02:18.718
They're the foundation
of civil society.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.003
Ball.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.723
Knock yourself out.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.551
Guarantee I'll make this shot.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.183
Oh, the humanity!

02:33.694 --> 02:35.354
Hey, Hetty, wanna take a shot?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.487
I prefer the attaque au fer.

02:37.657 --> 02:41.737
When the tip of my foil
scores a direct hit

02:41.911 --> 02:44.580
against the unguarded chest
of my opponent.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.238
Come on, Hetty, one shot.
Save the planet.

02:47.416 --> 02:50.536
Boys' games can wait.
A dead marine can't.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.087
Upstairs. We get it.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.879
That better be waste paper
you're using.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.092
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.089
Yes.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.678
Lance Corporal Daniel Zuna,

03:06.853 --> 03:10.268
stationed without incident
at Camp Pendleton until last night.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.101
Taken by a member
of the paparazzi.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.837
That'd be "paparazzo" then,
wouldn't it?

03:15.945 --> 03:17.605
Because "paparazzi" with an I is plural,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.654
- so "paparazzo."
- Ahem.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.733
These were taken last night
near an alley

03:21.909 --> 03:23.783
outside of a nightclub
called Four-Twenty

03:23.953 --> 03:25.151
on Hollywood Boulevard.

03:25.329 --> 03:28.414
Four-Twenty has an incredible DJ.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.711
What? A girl's gotta get her freak on
now and then.

03:34.922 --> 03:36.416
Preliminary autopsy indicates.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.592
Lance Corporal Zuna
died from massive blood loss.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.251
- Gunshot?
- No, no signs of physical trauma.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.339
But here's the freaky part.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.891
He bled out through his eyes,
ears, nose and mouth.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.264
Lance Corporal Zuna
was on two-week leave.

03:51.772 --> 03:54.857
Spends a lot of his off time
at an MMA gym

03:55.234 --> 03:56.693
called the Blood & Guts Warriors.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.818
MMA. Mixed martial arts.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.815
Well, the victim has been on leave

04:00.990 --> 04:04.026
after coming off a guard duty rotation
at a bio-lab facility,

04:04.202 --> 04:07.072
so assume he may have been exposed
to a biohazard.

04:07.246 --> 04:09.784
HAZMAT assured me
there's no contagion.

04:09.957 --> 04:12.709
But due caution is advised.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.332
We need to track Zuna's movements
while he was on leave.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.999
Kensi, sniff around Zuna's gym.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.130
See what you can find out
from his buddies.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.180
We can always bring them in later
if we have to.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.965
Meanwhile, Sam and I
will be wearing gloves in an alley

04:24.138 --> 04:25.378
outside of Hollywood Boulevard.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.317
Substantial pooling.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.521
It's more like a lake.

04:40.696 --> 04:41.776
Don't go too close.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.867
You don't have to say
biohazard twice.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.387
It's close to the front door
of the club.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.448
You think he was waiting
to meet somebody?

04:52.124 --> 04:56.668
He didn't have a stamp on his hands.
He never even went inside.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.707
He was worried enough
to come armed.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.337
The average body
holds six quarts of blood.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.506
- Looks like Zuna lost every last drop.
- And then some.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.878
- Hey, G.
- Eric.

05:07.056 --> 05:10.140
Does Zuna's preliminary autopsy
report estimate blood loss?

05:10.309 --> 05:11.424
Let's see.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.722
Yeah, it estimates the victim
lost half his blood supply.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.475
This is more than three quarts
of blood.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.395
Call the pathologist. See
if Zuna's toxicology report's in yet.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.858
All right, hold on. I'm checking now.

05:23.030 --> 05:25.948
Before fights, some fighters
like to boost their blood supply.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.074
It adds red blood cells
and increases endurance,

05:28.244 --> 05:30.402
so they store up their own blood
and they reinject it.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.323
It's called blood packing.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.743
So Zuna gained a tactical advantage
by bending the rules.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.919
- Yeah, and it cost him.
- Maybe.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.757
It does explain the excess blood
in the body and on the ground.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.965
So do you have a theory
on why a healthy guy

05:45.136 --> 05:47.378
with no signs of trauma
would bleed out in an alley?

05:47.555 --> 05:49.631
Hey, guys, toxicology is back.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.476
Zuna had high levels of heparin
in his system.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.674
It's a blood thinner.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.373
Pathologist says
that amount of heparin

05:55.521 --> 05:57.395
would have caused
unstoppable haemorrhaging.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.601
It made the blood seep out the most
porous membranes in the body.

06:00.776 --> 06:02.852
Eyes, nose, ears.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.279
But nobody packs their body with blood
and willingly takes blood thinners.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.993
Looks like Hetty can stop worrying
that he was exposed to a biohazard.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.577
And we can start worrying
about who the murderer is.

06:25.992 --> 06:27.736
There you go. Don't wait.

06:28.445 --> 06:29.690
Don't wait. Don't wait.

06:29.863 --> 06:32.401
Gil, Gil, Gil. Don't wait.

06:32.574 --> 06:34.414
When he gives you his back,
get those hooks in.

06:34.576 --> 06:36.403
- You're gonna make a choke.
- Yes, sir, sure.

06:36.578 --> 06:37.741
Let's go and see it again.

06:39.081 --> 06:40.160
There you go.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.583
You wanna train,
it's 60 bucks a month.

06:43.752 --> 06:44.915
You bring your own gear.

06:45.087 --> 06:47.047
We got no women's locker room,
change in your car.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.417
No. I mean, hi.

06:48.590 --> 06:50.915
I'm not here to train. I'm a fr...

06:51.093 --> 06:52.635
Was a friend of Daniel's.

06:53.971 --> 06:57.256
- You heard what happened?
- I still can't believe it.

06:57.432 --> 07:00.932
I just thought I'd come see this place.
He was always talking about it.

07:03.397 --> 07:05.935
Well, Danny was a hell of a fighter.

07:06.108 --> 07:07.851
Even better man.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.268
- I'm Victor Janklow.
- Tracy.

07:10.445 --> 07:12.936
- You his girl?
- I guess.

07:13.115 --> 07:17.990
We only just started dating,
but it was intense.

07:19.121 --> 07:21.576
So how can you guys keep training
if, you know?

07:21.748 --> 07:23.990
We're Marines. It's how we do it.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.501
I was Danny's platoon sergeant.

07:27.671 --> 07:30.126
He talked about you a lot.

07:30.299 --> 07:32.587
Yeah, probably only half
of what he told you was true.

07:32.759 --> 07:34.467
Bad half.

07:34.803 --> 07:36.511
I thought maybe
if I saw where he trained,

07:36.680 --> 07:38.222
it would help me stay connected.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.632
- You know any of the guys?
- No, never met them.

07:40.809 --> 07:43.644
Hey, hey, hey.
Guys, guys, guys, come here.

07:43.812 --> 07:45.390
Come here.

07:45.981 --> 07:48.686
This is Corporal Craig Mangold,
retired.

07:48.984 --> 07:51.107
This is Corporal Dale Johnson.

07:51.278 --> 07:53.354
Corporal Nelson Shabazz.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.108
And that's Jason Wyler.

07:55.282 --> 07:57.274
This is Tracy, Danny's girl.

07:57.451 --> 07:59.776
Yeah? How did you find out?

07:59.953 --> 08:02.705
Police called me.
My number's in his cell phone.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.411
Danny had a lot of girls' numbers
in his cell phone.

08:05.584 --> 08:07.790
Well, I guess mine
was just the last one dialled.

08:10.505 --> 08:12.498
Come on, Jason,
we're all feeling bad.

08:12.674 --> 08:14.034
Maybe it was a mistake
coming here.

08:14.176 --> 08:15.800
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

08:15.969 --> 08:17.463
You come by here any time, okay?

08:21.016 --> 08:22.973
- Thank you.
- Thanks for stopping by.

08:24.561 --> 08:26.103
Hey.

08:26.730 --> 08:30.016
Sorry about Jason.
He's wound a little tight.

08:30.192 --> 08:31.603
That's okay.

08:33.236 --> 08:37.482
Listen, if you wanna talk,
there's some things I...

08:43.121 --> 08:44.153
Maybe a drink sometime.

08:44.331 --> 08:45.955
Sure. Um...

08:51.088 --> 08:52.748
One for Danny?

08:58.595 --> 09:00.884
Pathologist says
the heparin was injected in the body

09:01.056 --> 09:02.716
about an hour before he died.

09:02.891 --> 09:05.014
Means he lost a lot of blood
very quickly.

09:05.185 --> 09:07.145
I'm surprised
he didn't lose consciousness sooner.

09:07.270 --> 09:09.643
Well, his staff NCO said
he was one hell of a fighter.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.353
Which is especially interesting
given his slight stature.

09:12.734 --> 09:15.771
But Daniel Zuna was essentially
the runt of the Warriors' litter.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.985
Not physically strong,
more of a scrapper.

09:18.156 --> 09:20.908
Which is why you never turn your back
on a small guy.

09:25.205 --> 09:27.743
You know,
when I was surfing in Vietnam,

09:27.916 --> 09:30.917
they called me khong Io, "the giant."

09:36.842 --> 09:39.297
Well, this giant was forced
to develop the ability

09:39.469 --> 09:42.755
to take a lot of physical punishment
and still keep on fighting.

09:42.931 --> 09:44.591
That explains the blood packing.

09:44.766 --> 09:47.055
Look, Zuna was desperate
to prove himself.

09:47.227 --> 09:49.350
In my experience,
relentless behaviour like Zuna's

09:49.521 --> 09:52.392
is almost always driven by some
major league personal demons.

09:52.566 --> 09:56.646
Does major league personal demons
actually appear in the DSM IV?

09:56.820 --> 09:59.109
Well, sometimes I feel
like I'm getting too technical,

09:59.281 --> 10:01.487
so I like to throw in
the occasional colloquial term.

10:02.451 --> 10:04.942
Okay, Blood & Guts Warriors.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.489
Or in layman's terms,
the badass kickboxers.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.036
The Warriors fight as a team,

10:10.208 --> 10:12.782
mostly taking on
other gyms in the area.

10:14.212 --> 10:17.166
Victor Janklow and Craig Mangold
are former Marines.

10:17.340 --> 10:20.840
Janklow was their platoon sergeant
when they all served together in Iraq.

10:21.428 --> 10:23.136
He lost an eye,
left the Marine Corps.

10:23.305 --> 10:26.923
Now he owns the gym
and all the other guys train there.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.935
Dale Johnson and Nelson Shabazz
are active-duty Marines,

10:30.103 --> 10:31.895
both served with Zuna.

10:32.063 --> 10:34.056
Well, what about Jason Wyler?

10:34.232 --> 10:36.024
He strikes me as kind of a wannabe.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.975
Wannabe Wyler is the only one
who wasn't a Marine.

10:39.154 --> 10:41.727
- I got nothing on him yet.
- Keep looking, khong Io.

10:42.532 --> 10:44.359
Something about him
set off a warning bell.

10:44.534 --> 10:46.278
Maybe it was his baby blues.

10:46.453 --> 10:48.445
Or his fluffy hair.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.867
What about Zuna's phone records?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.869
Um... Let's see.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.499
In the last few days,
he called several of the Warriors

10:56.671 --> 11:00.123
and his former commanding officer,
guy by the name of Scott Davis.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.293
What about the last call he made?

11:02.969 --> 11:04.629
That was it. To Davis.

11:04.805 --> 11:07.260
He left the Marine Corps
as a lieutenant.

11:07.432 --> 11:09.804
Talk to Davis.
Find out why Zuna called.

11:10.393 --> 11:11.888
Kensi and I will hit Zuna's crib.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.268
That's colloquial for house.

11:15.690 --> 11:16.722
I knew that.

11:20.028 --> 11:22.863
Zuna wanted to meet this week.
I told him I was too busy.

11:23.031 --> 11:25.985
- Were you?
- The truth is I resented the call.

11:26.159 --> 11:28.531
Dan Zuna was nothing but trouble
when he was in my command.

11:29.204 --> 11:30.828
Trouble how?

11:31.832 --> 11:34.667
When I was his lieutenant,
it was my duty to mentor him.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.792
But as a civilian, it's a different story.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.583
What about the others?
Mangold, Shabazz, Johnson.

11:39.756 --> 11:42.627
Every man in Staff Sergeant Janklow's
platoon was a fine Marine.

11:42.801 --> 11:44.628
Except Lance Corporal Zuna.

11:45.178 --> 11:47.254
If you have to know,
Zuna had a drug problem.

11:48.723 --> 11:50.004
It never appeared on his record.

11:50.183 --> 11:52.176
I never reported it.

11:52.394 --> 11:53.805
We were taking casualties
every day.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.221
There was not let-up in sight.
Those were the dog days.

11:57.232 --> 11:58.952
You needed all the Marines
you could muster.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.098
I gave him a warning.

12:00.277 --> 12:03.278
I told him to get it together or take
an Other Than Honourable Discharge.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.069
Did your platoon sergeant
know about this?

12:06.241 --> 12:08.566
If Staff Sergeant Janklow knew,
he never let on.

12:08.743 --> 12:11.697
Maybe Zuna kept it from him,
but I don't know how.

12:11.872 --> 12:13.698
It's amazing
what you overlook in war.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.743
The platoon was tight.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.744
Still are from what I hear.

12:17.919 --> 12:22.415
You know, I lost two men
in a firefight in Fallujah.

12:22.591 --> 12:24.133
It's a miracle I didn't lose more.

12:24.801 --> 12:26.343
What does this have to do
with Zuna?

12:26.511 --> 12:28.171
Zuna was driving the Humvee.

12:28.346 --> 12:30.754
I don't know if he was high or not,

12:30.932 --> 12:32.676
but somehow
he got lost in the backstreets

12:32.851 --> 12:34.891
and he drove us straight
into an enemy strong point.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.270
We got pinned down. We had to fight
our way out, and after that

12:39.274 --> 12:41.480
the unit was never the same.

12:42.027 --> 12:43.485
Thanks for coming.

12:44.529 --> 12:46.189
You never told me.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.735
How Zuna died. Was it the drugs?

12:50.452 --> 12:52.444
Someone pumped him
full of blood thinner.

12:52.621 --> 12:55.705
He died in an alley.
Bled out all over the pavement.

13:00.128 --> 13:01.539
I know what you're gonna ask me.

13:02.631 --> 13:05.585
Did anyone in the squad blame him
for what happened in Fallujah?

13:05.759 --> 13:06.957
Blame him enough to kill him?

13:10.430 --> 13:12.588
It's been a long time.

13:12.891 --> 13:15.643
Long enough to forgive in my book,
but...

13:17.854 --> 13:19.432
It's a fair question.

13:22.150 --> 13:24.059
This is Zuna's place.

13:24.694 --> 13:26.486
Do you wanna do the honour?

13:26.655 --> 13:27.686
What? No key?

13:27.864 --> 13:29.323
Well, what's the challenge in that?

13:29.491 --> 13:32.029
Why does everything
have to be a challenge for you guys?

13:32.202 --> 13:34.657
The lock
has a double-sided cylinder.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.162
You saw it coming up the walk.

13:37.332 --> 13:38.910
Pain in the ass, aren't they?

13:44.464 --> 13:46.006
For some.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.593
Crappy furniture, brand-new TV.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.894
The man had his priorities.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.232
Laptop.

14:03.775 --> 14:06.183
Left on and not password protected.

14:06.736 --> 14:08.314
This is going to be easy.

14:09.698 --> 14:11.821
Maybe he's got nothing to hide.

14:19.541 --> 14:20.869
It's like a pharmacy in here.

14:25.422 --> 14:27.628
Oh, my God, you scared me.

14:28.758 --> 14:30.668
- How'd you get in here?
- Danny gave me a key.

14:30.844 --> 14:32.717
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

14:32.887 --> 14:34.631
Spare room.

14:35.181 --> 14:36.640
Danny's laptop?

14:36.808 --> 14:40.094
I e-mailed him some photos.

14:40.562 --> 14:42.768
Private photos.

14:42.939 --> 14:45.430
Like the two of you watching
the sunset at Santa Monica Pier?

14:45.609 --> 14:48.609
Or the kind where you're not
wearing anything but a smile?

14:49.070 --> 14:52.522
Certain kind of person
finds private photos like that,

14:52.699 --> 14:54.027
they end up on the Internet.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.569
Wow,
so definitely X-rated then, huh?

14:57.746 --> 15:00.201
Nobody under 17 admitted.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.286
Well-played.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.957
Yeah, Danny said he met a girl.

15:06.004 --> 15:07.332
Said that she was hot.

15:08.256 --> 15:09.335
You think he meant me?

15:10.425 --> 15:13.094
I sort of assumed he had others.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.088
Oh, no, no, no. He...

15:17.265 --> 15:19.222
He definitely meant you.

15:19.392 --> 15:22.346
Talked about how you two
used to party pretty hard together.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.600
One thing leads to another.

15:23.772 --> 15:26.726
The next thing you know
out comes the camera.

15:27.651 --> 15:28.765
Right.

15:28.943 --> 15:31.066
Except for he said your name
was Kate.

15:35.450 --> 15:36.695
So who the hell are you?

15:37.786 --> 15:40.111
I met him at a party.
Paid him for some stuff.

15:40.288 --> 15:42.495
He never delivered.
I came to pick it up myself.

15:42.957 --> 15:44.037
Is that why you're here?

15:44.209 --> 15:46.248
No, because I don't do drugs.

15:46.419 --> 15:48.259
So maybe Danny's connection
never came through.

15:48.421 --> 15:52.466
- You know who his supplier is?
- Well, I was hoping it was you.

15:54.469 --> 15:56.189
Or maybe you found
what you were looking for

15:56.346 --> 15:57.377
before I got here.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.514
Maybe you found some cash.

16:01.309 --> 16:03.053
Maybe you should empty
those pockets.

16:13.154 --> 16:14.352
Did you call for a cab?

16:14.948 --> 16:16.490
That would be me.

16:18.576 --> 16:20.569
Thanks for stopping by.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.638
Nice save with the cab.

16:49.816 --> 16:52.022
Dirty pictures. Nice touch.

16:52.193 --> 16:54.565
Yeah, except it didn't work.

16:54.738 --> 16:57.063
I had to switch up to a drug buy.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.364
And he was interested.

16:59.784 --> 17:00.982
You should consider investing

17:01.161 --> 17:03.367
in some of those little green-tree
air fresheners.

17:03.538 --> 17:05.079
I'm just saying.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.114
Thanks.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.012
That's my snitch money
for the entire month.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.577
Hetty's gonna blow a gasket.

17:12.756 --> 17:13.787
Yeah, Eric.

17:13.964 --> 17:17.500
Whoever Kensi's been talking with,
it's not Jason Wyler.

17:17.676 --> 17:20.595
I've checked every known database.
There's only a driver's licence.

17:21.013 --> 17:25.391
No social security number,
school records, immunization.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.885
Not even a library card.

17:28.354 --> 17:30.098
Your Jason Wyler doesn't exist.

17:41.743 --> 17:43.901
Anything new on Wyler?

17:44.078 --> 17:45.621
Still tracking his alias.

17:45.789 --> 17:48.280
Maybe he killed Zuna.
He shared his house.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.938
He must've known
he was blood packing.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.243
He could have easily introduced
the heparin.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.958
Lieutenant Davis says Zuna
had a drug problem in Iraq.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.871
Maybe it was a drug deal gone wrong
between him and Wyler.

17:58.009 --> 18:01.378
We can't answer the why
until we know who Wyler is.

18:01.554 --> 18:04.259
Nate, check for any recent
drug-related activity at the gym

18:04.432 --> 18:06.591
or involving MMA fighters.

18:06.768 --> 18:08.408
These guys are all looking
to get an edge.

18:08.561 --> 18:10.554
Methamphetamine,
ephedrine, cocaine,

18:10.730 --> 18:12.806
all likely stimulants
to appear in that environment.

18:12.982 --> 18:15.189
Not to mention
performance-enhancing drugs.

18:15.777 --> 18:17.022
Check it anyways.

18:17.195 --> 18:19.188
How are we doing
on the paparazzi footage?

18:19.364 --> 18:22.151
Literally thousands of shots.
I'm still sifting through it.

18:22.325 --> 18:23.570
I'm still stuck on Wyler.

18:23.952 --> 18:24.983
Stuck.

18:25.161 --> 18:26.786
Smitten. Whatever.

18:26.955 --> 18:29.956
He's hiding behind an alias.
He's carrying a weapon.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.201
From the first moment I saw him,
he seemed hinky.

18:35.713 --> 18:36.911
Warriors are down a fighter.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.711
You might wanna try out.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.756
- I'm gonna need to backstop you.
- Better hurry up, Eric.

18:41.928 --> 18:44.336
I gotta get that open spot
before somebody else does.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.756
Sounds like you're headed
for the gym.

18:51.938 --> 18:53.681
DeMarko Williams. Striker.

18:53.857 --> 18:56.577
Stand-up fighters tend to get their
asses handed to them around here.

18:56.734 --> 18:59.404
- I've got ground game too.
- Really?

19:00.029 --> 19:01.358
Is that right?

19:01.531 --> 19:03.371
The word is you guys
are looking for a new man.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.992
I'd like to show you what I've got.

19:05.201 --> 19:07.526
- Ever fight outside North Carolina?
- Not yet.

19:07.704 --> 19:09.424
I'm looking forward
to giving the West Coast

19:09.581 --> 19:11.490
- a little taste of home cooking.
- Heh.

19:11.666 --> 19:14.038
Well, you know, we got
a spot open on tonight's card.

19:14.210 --> 19:15.289
Let's see how you do.

19:15.461 --> 19:16.660
Cool. I appreciate it.

19:16.838 --> 19:18.629
Did I just hear that right?

19:18.798 --> 19:21.254
DeMarko Williams, Jason Wyler.

19:21.718 --> 19:23.627
I thought I was getting Zuna's spot.

19:23.803 --> 19:25.345
You're still a little green, Jason.

19:25.513 --> 19:27.921
So this guy just walks in off the street
and takes my place?

19:28.099 --> 19:30.056
Williams has a lot of fights
under his belt.

19:30.226 --> 19:32.349
He's got 27 bouts, 26 KOs.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.597
- What happened in that last fight?
- Forfeit.

19:35.106 --> 19:37.811
- The guy never showed up.
- All right, listen, I kept my head down.

19:37.984 --> 19:39.858
I did my training. I deserve my shot.

19:40.778 --> 19:41.858
Okay.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.607
You wanna fight your way in?

19:43.781 --> 19:45.573
You and Williams, tonight.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.450
Winner joins the Warriors.

19:51.372 --> 19:53.080
Have fun, gentlemen.

20:01.341 --> 20:04.460
Wyler's seen me, so I'm gonna be
watching from the Op Centre.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.712
Kensi will be in the crowd.

20:08.348 --> 20:10.629
This guy doesn't stand a chance
going toe-to-toe with you,

20:10.767 --> 20:13.472
so he's gonna wanna grapple,
get you on the ground.

20:13.645 --> 20:16.325
That's okay, I'll sprawl and brawl.
Stay on my feet and outlast him.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.888
Outlast? This isn't Survivor.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.736
Look, he tries an arm bar,
slam his head, don't wait.

20:21.903 --> 20:23.463
In the SEALs,
we learn combat techniques

20:23.571 --> 20:24.811
from a variety of martial arts.

20:24.948 --> 20:28.399
- I know my counter moves.
- Sam, take him out.

20:28.576 --> 20:29.607
Take him out fast.

20:29.786 --> 20:30.866
The longer this thing goes,

20:31.037 --> 20:32.697
the better chance he has
of getting lucky.

20:32.872 --> 20:34.192
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

20:34.332 --> 20:37.582
G, I'm gonna be okay.

20:40.255 --> 20:41.630
Trust me.

20:46.427 --> 20:48.005
Troubled, Mr. Callen?

20:48.179 --> 20:49.923
He's not ready.

20:50.139 --> 20:54.007
I beg to differ,
but Sam's technique is splendid.

20:54.185 --> 20:56.391
I'm not talking
about his technique, Hetty.

20:56.813 --> 20:58.141
He's reluctant.

20:58.314 --> 21:00.188
Because he has nothing to prove.

21:00.358 --> 21:03.359
There's no joy in a blood sport
for a man like Sam

21:03.528 --> 21:06.279
who has been tested
so many times in battle.

21:09.450 --> 21:11.028
Wyler's not gonna hold back.

21:11.202 --> 21:12.696
But you think Sam will.

21:12.870 --> 21:16.121
Sam doesn't wanna hurt him,
and I think that makes him vulnerable.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.206
Sam knows what he has to do.

21:23.006 --> 21:24.204
I just hope he does it.

21:25.258 --> 21:28.674
The body versus the mind.

21:28.845 --> 21:32.178
There's a fight indeed.

21:38.313 --> 21:40.982
Introducing first from the red corner,

21:41.149 --> 21:43.521
weighing in at 185 pounds,

21:43.693 --> 21:45.436
he hails from Los Angeles,
California,

21:45.611 --> 21:50.320
with 19 wins, 15 by the way of KO,
and only four defeats.

21:50.491 --> 21:53.528
It's Jason Wyler.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.447
His opponent from the blue corner...

21:56.623 --> 21:58.615
Full 1080p resolution
on the security cam.

21:58.791 --> 21:59.906
We got a great angle.

22:00.084 --> 22:01.329
On the big screen.

22:03.379 --> 22:06.250
Twenty-six KOs and one forfeit.

22:06.424 --> 22:11.252
He hails from Raleigh, North Carolina.
Please welcome DeMarko Williams.

22:11.429 --> 22:14.513
Janklow, I need to talk to you now.

22:18.936 --> 22:21.427
All right, gentlemen.
It's the first round, step back.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.101
Are you ready? Are you ready?

22:23.274 --> 22:24.519
Let's get it on.

22:39.874 --> 22:41.072
Not good.

22:41.501 --> 22:42.699
Sam, don't hold back.

22:50.843 --> 22:52.386
No spiking.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.600
You need to take care of this.

23:40.268 --> 23:41.928
Stay down. Stay down.

24:01.372 --> 24:03.116
That's it, that's it. He's done.

24:04.542 --> 24:07.033
- That's the end of round one.
- Fight's over, Hetty.

24:07.211 --> 24:09.667
But it's the first round for us.
Sam's in.

24:10.965 --> 24:12.543
Winner by knock-out.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.211
DeMarko Williams.

24:17.638 --> 24:20.474
- DeMarko Williams!
- I'm done, Janklow.

24:21.517 --> 24:22.798
Thanks for coming out.

24:22.977 --> 24:26.428
Come back tomorrow night
for another night of hard-hitting action.

24:26.606 --> 24:29.642
- Mangold, wait.
- It's gotta stop, you hear me?

24:29.817 --> 24:31.276
Why? Because you say so?

24:31.736 --> 24:33.416
I didn't take orders from you
in the corps,

24:33.571 --> 24:36.655
and I sure as hell ain't taking orders
from you now, corporal.

24:41.662 --> 24:42.694
Are you okay?

24:42.872 --> 24:44.829
Hotheaded son of a bitch.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.742
What happened?

24:47.460 --> 24:48.835
Nothing.

24:49.003 --> 24:50.830
It was nothing.

24:53.132 --> 24:55.374
Janklow and Mangold
just had it out in the office.

24:55.551 --> 24:57.045
I couldn't tell what it was about.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.928
Kensi, where's Sam?

25:01.057 --> 25:03.014
You did North Carolina proud.

25:03.184 --> 25:05.509
A little rusty, but I felt good.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.428
Looked like you pulled
a couple punches out there tonight.

25:08.606 --> 25:10.349
Don't wanna show my A game
until I have to.

25:10.525 --> 25:13.525
Always keep a little in reserves.
That's a good strategy.

25:13.694 --> 25:15.770
He's coming out now.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.145
Janklow's with him.

25:17.990 --> 25:21.406
Look, make sure you alternate heat
and ice on those bruises tonight.

25:21.577 --> 25:23.700
We'll see you first thing in the morning
for training.

25:23.871 --> 25:25.282
- Welcome to the Warriors.
- Thanks.

25:25.456 --> 25:27.663
- All right.
- All right.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.536
I worked hard for that spot.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.790
I guess not hard enough.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.212
Oh, trouble.

25:37.385 --> 25:38.879
Janklow just went back inside.

25:39.887 --> 25:40.918
Wyler came out.

25:41.097 --> 25:43.303
Stand by. Let Sam handle it.

25:43.474 --> 25:45.099
So how much? Huh?

25:45.268 --> 25:46.845
How much for you to walk away
right now?

25:47.019 --> 25:49.226
- Nobody buys me.
- Really?

25:49.397 --> 25:50.428
If you stick around here,

25:50.606 --> 25:52.566
you'll be looking over your shoulder
every minute.

25:52.733 --> 25:55.307
Is that supposed to scare me?
I already kicked your ass.

25:58.614 --> 26:00.607
- Stop it.
- They're fighting.

26:04.912 --> 26:07.450
Uh-oh. Bigger problem.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.451
L.A.P.D.'s on scene.

26:09.625 --> 26:10.870
L.A.P. D?

26:11.043 --> 26:12.586
How'd they get there?
Who called them?

26:12.753 --> 26:14.711
I don't know,
but they're taking them in.

26:14.881 --> 26:16.873
We cannot risk
blowing Sam's cover.

26:17.258 --> 26:18.538
Eric, call Parker Centre.

26:18.718 --> 26:20.757
Get me the chief of police.

26:20.928 --> 26:23.466
L.A.P.D. Is screwing up
our undercover.

26:31.772 --> 26:32.887
All right, let's go.

26:35.484 --> 26:37.144
Watch your head.

26:38.237 --> 26:39.731
You might need a stitch.

26:40.156 --> 26:42.825
Come on, Wyler.
What's your angle?

26:43.534 --> 26:45.112
Why do you want in the Warriors
so bad?

26:45.286 --> 26:48.821
Hang out with Marines? Ooo-rah.
Is that it?

26:48.998 --> 26:50.623
Wyler, on your feet.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.365
Well, well, well.

26:53.544 --> 26:55.453
I'll tell you what.

26:55.630 --> 27:00.624
It's been nice meeting you, Williams.
But I think I'm gonna take off.

27:00.801 --> 27:02.794
Williams, you're sprung too.

27:03.971 --> 27:05.050
Wait. What?

27:08.142 --> 27:10.182
- Who are you?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

27:10.311 --> 27:11.639
Right this way.

27:13.981 --> 27:16.733
So let me introduce you.

27:16.901 --> 27:20.768
Special Agent Sam Hanna, NCIS,

27:20.947 --> 27:26.533
meet Detective Marty Deeks,
L.A.P.D., who's undercover.

27:26.702 --> 27:28.991
Ain't that a kick in the head?

27:40.357 --> 27:42.266
So I put a call
into the West L.A. Station,

27:42.442 --> 27:44.522
had them hide two black and whites
around the corner.

27:44.695 --> 27:47.530
I needed you off the street,
so I picked a fight in the alley.

27:47.698 --> 27:50.782
L.A.P.D. Swooped in
and arrested us both.

27:50.951 --> 27:52.860
Figured they wouldn't release you
for 24 hours,

27:53.036 --> 27:55.236
and that might buy me the time
I needed back at the gym.

27:57.416 --> 27:58.696
Now, you guys...

28:00.168 --> 28:02.790
You guys
are some serious operators, huh?

28:02.963 --> 28:04.291
Yeah?

28:05.591 --> 28:09.423
Ahh. Because when I go in deep,
I'm on my own.

28:10.304 --> 28:12.676
But now you guys, well...

28:12.848 --> 28:17.842
I'll tell you what, our safe house
doesn't have a view of the water.

28:18.186 --> 28:21.805
Except for, of course,
when the plumbing backs up.

28:24.526 --> 28:26.934
But I bet you got some sort
of a situation room too.

28:27.154 --> 28:28.316
Yeah?

28:28.488 --> 28:29.528
Lots of technical support.

28:30.365 --> 28:32.157
Lots of cool hardware. Plasma TVs.

28:32.326 --> 28:35.529
Maybe a guy at a keyboard,
typing in some logistics.

28:35.704 --> 28:40.781
I mean, not right next door,
but close. Am I right?

28:40.959 --> 28:42.288
- Monterey Park.
- Culver City.

28:42.461 --> 28:43.789
That is adorable.

28:45.297 --> 28:46.460
Both talking at once.

28:49.176 --> 28:50.836
And you.

28:51.011 --> 28:52.691
Well, at first
I wasn't too sure about you,

28:52.846 --> 28:54.969
but that Internet photo thing
really sold me.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.967
So riddle me this.

28:57.142 --> 28:58.423
Did you pre-plan that?

28:59.019 --> 29:00.679
Or maybe...

29:01.188 --> 29:02.812
Maybe that happened in real life?

29:03.649 --> 29:07.693
Crashing in his spare bedroom?
Is that the best you can do?

29:08.195 --> 29:10.187
You were lucky I didn't shoot you.

29:10.364 --> 29:11.395
I was vamping.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.365
You in the mood to share, Deeks?

29:13.533 --> 29:15.213
That depends on
if the mood's reciprocated.

29:15.369 --> 29:17.575
I gotta be honest,
I'm not feeling a lot of love now.

29:17.746 --> 29:19.586
- Sorry for the left hook.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

29:19.748 --> 29:22.037
You aren't the only one
that pulled their punches.

29:26.421 --> 29:27.964
Okay.

29:29.049 --> 29:31.884
L.A.P.D.'s been getting intel
on the gym for about six months.

29:32.052 --> 29:34.652
We think it's a possible distribution
point for the Juarez Cartel.

29:34.763 --> 29:37.634
So heroin, coke, meth,
it's essentially a mini-mart for drugs.

29:37.808 --> 29:40.050
It's what you want when you want it.

29:40.227 --> 29:42.266
The Warriors, it's a tightknit group,

29:42.437 --> 29:44.477
but I managed to work my way in
through Danny Zuna.

29:44.648 --> 29:48.231
Zuna's autopsy turned up negative
for illegal drugs.

29:48.402 --> 29:52.351
That's because Zuna's jones were
steroids and prescription painkillers.

29:52.531 --> 29:53.811
Zuna was literally two days away

29:53.949 --> 29:55.869
from introducing me to
his supplier when he died.

29:55.993 --> 29:57.487
When he was murdered.

30:00.455 --> 30:02.415
He was acting pretty paranoid
those last few days.

30:02.541 --> 30:04.822
- Something was eating at him.
- We're working a homicide.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.760
And all you have
is possible drug distribution

30:06.920 --> 30:08.560
and loose connections
south of the border?

30:08.714 --> 30:11.169
These past 24 hours
have been tense, okay?

30:11.341 --> 30:14.093
This thing's coming to a head,
I can feel that.

30:14.428 --> 30:16.586
Thanks for all your help, Deeks.

30:18.140 --> 30:19.550
Thanks for...?

30:19.725 --> 30:21.005
Are you kidding me?

30:21.685 --> 30:23.263
I was undercover on this thing first.

30:23.437 --> 30:25.677
If anything, you guys
should be backing me up, all right?

30:25.814 --> 30:28.483
This is a Los Angeles
Police Department investigation.

30:28.650 --> 30:32.150
Because the case involves
serving Marines,

30:32.321 --> 30:35.772
it falls under NCIS jurisdiction.

30:35.949 --> 30:38.784
That said,
let's call this a joint operation

30:38.952 --> 30:40.826
and you'll both stay undercover.

30:40.996 --> 30:42.356
Gonna have to run this by my boss.

30:42.497 --> 30:44.953
I already have. Ruben says, "Hi."

30:46.376 --> 30:48.168
Mr. Callen?

30:49.338 --> 30:51.414
Pull up the unit's service records.

30:51.590 --> 30:55.753
Logs, reports, anything you can find
from their deployment in Fallujah.

30:56.678 --> 30:59.169
You ready for round two, detective?

30:59.348 --> 31:01.091
Ring that bell.

31:05.937 --> 31:08.475
The conquering hero.
What's up, Williams?

31:09.066 --> 31:10.975
The newest Warrior.

31:12.277 --> 31:13.985
Wyler.

31:14.446 --> 31:16.485
Heh-heh-heh.
What's up, Devil Dogs?

31:16.656 --> 31:19.112
- You a Marine?
- Second regiment, Lejeune.

31:19.284 --> 31:22.202
I knew it, man.
I could tell how you carried yourself.

31:22.371 --> 31:25.325
- What was your MOS?
- Three-three-eight-one, food service.

31:25.499 --> 31:26.697
You were a cook?

31:26.917 --> 31:28.660
Heh. Oh-three-eleven infantry.

31:29.127 --> 31:30.159
Knuckle-dragger.

31:31.338 --> 31:34.339
Although I did cook up a pretty good
ass-whopping for Wyler last night.

31:34.841 --> 31:36.798
Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, Wyler.

31:36.968 --> 31:38.676
Except for the ass-whopping part.

31:38.845 --> 31:42.510
Yeah.
Laid him out like Sunday's supper.

31:45.519 --> 31:46.764
We might have something.

31:46.937 --> 31:50.602
It turns out Lieutenant Davis was
disciplined after the Fallujah ambush.

31:50.774 --> 31:52.517
- The incident he blamed on Zuna.
- Yes.

31:52.692 --> 31:55.100
But the investigation was shelved
because a week later,

31:55.278 --> 31:57.900
Davis was wounded by a sniper
and repatriated home.

31:58.365 --> 32:00.986
From weak in the knees
to a Purple Heart. Go figure.

32:01.159 --> 32:04.279
If you read in between the lines,
Davis was not the most popular leader.

32:04.454 --> 32:05.774
Buried deep in one of the reports

32:05.914 --> 32:08.701
is a disciplinary reprimand
by Davis to one of his men

32:08.875 --> 32:12.410
who "verbally attacked him and
accused him of being a widowmaker."

32:12.587 --> 32:13.702
What's the Marine's name?

32:14.381 --> 32:15.412
Corporal Craig Mangold.

32:15.590 --> 32:18.710
I've searched through all the photos
leading up to discovery of Zuna's body.

32:18.885 --> 32:20.712
A whole lot of nada.

32:20.887 --> 32:22.679
What about
after they found his body?

32:22.848 --> 32:26.762
Paparazzi went on a feeding frenzy
until the cops shut down the alley.

32:28.228 --> 32:30.434
All these were taken after that.

32:36.319 --> 32:37.897
There.

32:39.489 --> 32:42.858
- Lieutenant Scott Davis.
- I'm gonna need his current address.

32:53.128 --> 32:54.326
It's a pretty nice house

32:54.504 --> 32:56.296
for a 28-year-old
former Marine lieutenant.

32:56.882 --> 32:58.590
Daddy's money or something else?

32:58.759 --> 33:00.336
Our drug connection?

33:04.806 --> 33:06.265
NCIS. Federal agents.

33:07.017 --> 33:08.641
Over here.

33:08.810 --> 33:10.470
Stand clear.

33:11.438 --> 33:14.522
Do you think Mangold beat us here?
Took Davis out?

33:17.277 --> 33:19.946
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, his name's...

33:23.575 --> 33:25.200
Mangold.

33:35.311 --> 33:37.268
Eric, find Davis.

33:37.772 --> 33:39.732
Looks like L.A.P.D.
Has already got a BOLO on him.

33:40.066 --> 33:42.983
I'll try using his cell as a GPS.

33:46.364 --> 33:48.072
Word travels fast.

33:48.616 --> 33:51.487
Chief of detectives called me
as soon as you ID'd Mangold's body.

33:51.661 --> 33:52.692
So how's it laying out?

33:52.870 --> 33:54.110
Zuna and Mangold both suspected

33:54.247 --> 33:56.702
that Davis was responsible
for their friends dying in Iraq.

33:56.874 --> 33:58.634
So Mangold's upset
over Zuna's murder, right?

33:58.751 --> 33:59.996
Thinks that Davis killed him.

34:00.169 --> 34:01.729
When Mangold gets here,
Davis spots him.

34:01.879 --> 34:02.911
Shoots him first.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.297
- Yeah?
- Callen, I'm tracking Davis.

34:06.467 --> 34:08.460
He's pulling up to the house.

34:09.469 --> 34:11.344
Davis is here.

34:13.933 --> 34:15.130
Federal agents.

34:15.309 --> 34:17.847
- Out of the car.
- What the hell?

34:18.020 --> 34:19.940
- Hands behind your head.
- I didn't do anything.

34:20.106 --> 34:22.098
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your head.

34:22.275 --> 34:23.306
Are you people crazy?

34:23.484 --> 34:24.895
Behind your head.

34:26.154 --> 34:27.696
So your place or mine?

34:27.864 --> 34:29.239
We can manage okay.

34:29.407 --> 34:31.530
Oh, come on, Callen.
At least, let me hear his story.

34:31.701 --> 34:33.243
We'll take it from here.

34:33.411 --> 34:34.822
What story? What have I done?

34:34.996 --> 34:37.913
Thanks, Deeks. For everything.

34:38.081 --> 34:39.956
What? No hug?

34:42.628 --> 34:44.538
I didn't kill Daniel Zuna.

34:44.714 --> 34:47.549
He was waiting for you
outside the nightclub.

34:48.634 --> 34:49.748
That's right.

34:49.927 --> 34:51.837
We know you were there.

34:52.847 --> 34:56.679
And by the length of the miniskirt
on your lady friend,

34:57.768 --> 34:59.346
I'm guessing she wasn't your wife.

35:00.146 --> 35:01.605
If you got anything
you wanna say,

35:01.772 --> 35:03.931
now would be a real good time
to say it.

35:04.317 --> 35:05.797
Zuna called,
said he needed to see me.

35:05.943 --> 35:07.687
So did Mangold.

35:07.945 --> 35:10.152
Didn't know what they wanted.
Didn't care.

35:10.323 --> 35:13.110
Yeah, the problem is
they're both dead.

35:13.284 --> 35:14.363
Craig Mangold's dead?

35:14.869 --> 35:16.577
Found him
at the side of your house.

35:16.913 --> 35:18.573
That's two murders
with premeditation.

35:18.748 --> 35:20.824
Suddenly,
this becomes a death penalty case.

35:21.334 --> 35:22.496
I'm not saying anything else.

35:22.668 --> 35:24.578
You were an officer, not a grunt.

35:24.754 --> 35:27.708
If Zuna and Mangold came after you
and you killed them in self-defence,

35:27.882 --> 35:29.682
there's a good chance
you walk away from this.

35:29.842 --> 35:31.562
But you've gotta get out
in front of it now.

35:31.719 --> 35:32.834
I didn't kill anyone.

35:33.012 --> 35:34.210
Not even in Fallujah?

35:37.934 --> 35:41.219
Officer said you led them
into an ambush.

35:42.647 --> 35:44.022
Called you the widowmaker.

35:44.190 --> 35:45.435
I made some mistakes.

35:45.608 --> 35:47.186
I was 24 years old, for God's sake.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.444
I got over there
and saw things you couldn't imagine.

35:50.821 --> 35:52.731
Those were bad days.
Very bad days.

35:52.907 --> 35:55.991
Hard to tell the friendlies
from the insurgents.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.156
Somebody had to make
the decision.

35:59.705 --> 36:02.457
But you didn't always
make the right one, did you?

36:06.254 --> 36:08.709
We were driving,
I got to this intersection and...

36:09.423 --> 36:12.093
I got confused.
The streets all looked the same.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.126
I told Corporal Zuna to turn,
but he said he didn't want to.

36:16.305 --> 36:17.930
He said it was the wrong way.

36:18.099 --> 36:19.890
I ordered him to turn down
that backstreet,

36:20.059 --> 36:21.850
and I got those men killed.

36:24.689 --> 36:25.720
A week later, I got shot.

36:25.898 --> 36:28.270
And I'll tell you something,
I felt lucky.

36:28.901 --> 36:31.143
It got me the hell out of there.

36:32.864 --> 36:35.236
I think if I'd have stayed,
my men would have killed me.

36:51.215 --> 36:52.615
Pretty big admission
that he thought

36:52.758 --> 36:54.502
he was gonna get fragged
by his own men.

36:56.637 --> 36:57.668
Nate?

36:57.847 --> 36:59.447
Well, when you told him
Mangold was dead,

36:59.599 --> 37:01.971
his reaction appeared
to be totally honest.

37:02.143 --> 37:03.174
His brow never furrowed.

37:03.352 --> 37:05.428
He never looked away,
not even for a moment.

37:05.605 --> 37:08.045
When he talked about his fears
of being killed by his own men,

37:08.190 --> 37:10.267
it not only felt genuine,

37:10.443 --> 37:13.859
but it seems as if it was the first time
he'd ever even admitted it.

37:14.322 --> 37:15.899
To anyone.

37:19.410 --> 37:20.785
- Eric.
- Yeah?

37:20.953 --> 37:22.364
Bring up Janklow's service records.

37:22.538 --> 37:24.198
- We're on our way back.
- I'm on it.

37:24.874 --> 37:27.032
Keep him company. Let's go.

37:32.048 --> 37:34.087
Janklow wasn't wounded
in the Fallujah ambush.

37:34.258 --> 37:37.508
That means he was still in Iraq
when Davis was shot by the sniper.

37:37.678 --> 37:39.338
If his men thought Davis
was a widowmaker,

37:39.513 --> 37:40.758
you can bet Janklow did too.

37:40.932 --> 37:41.972
And a week after Fallujah,

37:42.141 --> 37:44.299
Davis is shot by a sniper
while on patrol.

37:44.477 --> 37:46.185
Who else was with him
on that patrol?

37:49.273 --> 37:52.191
Zuna, Mangold, Johnson
and Shabazz.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.605
Everybody but Janklow.

37:53.778 --> 37:54.857
Warn Sam.

38:02.495 --> 38:04.238
Mom, I told you
not to call me at the gym.

38:04.413 --> 38:07.165
Fallujah was Davis' fault.
Now Mangold's dead.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.792
Janklow killed him and Zuna.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.074
Get out of there now.

38:10.252 --> 38:12.494
Mom, I'll call you
when I'm done, okay?

38:13.839 --> 38:18.051
So I got a buddy in personnel
at Camp Lejeune.

38:18.511 --> 38:20.171
My mom gave me that phone,
don't break it.

38:22.098 --> 38:24.933
Sam's phone's been shut off.
The battery's disconnected.

38:25.101 --> 38:27.010
Eric, pull up the camera in the gym.

38:27.186 --> 38:29.677
There's something
about you didn't sit right with me.

38:29.855 --> 38:31.135
You were too good to be a grunt.

38:31.273 --> 38:32.993
So you had your buddy check me out.
So what?

38:33.192 --> 38:35.861
Your records show you were there,
exactly when you said.

38:36.028 --> 38:37.357
All right, then.

38:37.530 --> 38:40.199
Then I called some men I know
from the Second Marine Regiment.

38:40.366 --> 38:43.201
They never heard of you.
Nobody else down there has either.

38:43.703 --> 38:46.573
Looks like you only exist on paper,
Williams.

38:48.082 --> 38:50.751
We got a problem.
Eric, find Deeks.

38:51.419 --> 38:53.791
I don't know what you did
in the service.

38:54.714 --> 38:56.374
Watch the door.

38:57.758 --> 39:00.166
So let's start with your name.

39:03.014 --> 39:04.472
Your real name.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.178
Why don't you tell me about Fallujah,
platoon sergeant?

39:07.351 --> 39:08.671
So that's what you're here about?

39:08.811 --> 39:09.890
That and Lieutenant Davis.

39:10.062 --> 39:11.971
Lieutenant Davis was an amateur.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.188
If I hadn't done something,
he'd have killed us all.

39:14.316 --> 39:15.859
There's no clock on the battle.

39:16.027 --> 39:18.066
It's a waiting game.
You have two, three days.

39:18.237 --> 39:20.277
Your adrenaline's pumping.

39:20.448 --> 39:23.899
It's only a matter of time
before your body betrays your mind.

39:24.076 --> 39:26.401
You don't want your men
falling asleep out there.

39:26.579 --> 39:27.824
You're damn right, I didn't.

39:27.997 --> 39:30.914
Every man's at risk.
You had to do something.

39:31.083 --> 39:33.408
Keep them awake.
Keep your men sharp.

39:33.961 --> 39:36.203
It's the only way to give them
an edge for that long.

39:36.380 --> 39:38.420
But the drugs didn't stop coming
when you got home.

39:38.591 --> 39:39.871
You think because you're home,

39:40.051 --> 39:41.771
everything just goes back
to the way it was?

39:42.428 --> 39:44.219
You kept the supply coming.

39:44.597 --> 39:48.096
Painkillers, uppers, downers, steroids.
Whatever they needed.

39:49.602 --> 39:52.140
Yo, I wanna cancel my membership.
Turn in my key.

39:53.939 --> 39:55.102
Janklow.

40:06.786 --> 40:09.905
- Deeks!
- I'm good.

40:16.837 --> 40:18.913
You timed that pretty well, Deeks.

40:20.049 --> 40:21.128
Good job.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.969
Yeah, you're not so bad yourself.

40:25.137 --> 40:26.762
Janklow injected Zuna with heparin,

40:26.931 --> 40:29.848
told him it was steroids
to stop him confessing to Davis.

40:30.017 --> 40:32.093
Mangold tried to warn Davis
that he may be next,

40:32.269 --> 40:34.143
but Janklow followed him
and killed him.

40:34.313 --> 40:36.233
Which is just about the time
that Deeks showed up

40:36.399 --> 40:37.561
to save your butt at the gym.

40:37.733 --> 40:40.355
Yeah.
That's exactly how it happened.

40:41.112 --> 40:42.440
He's not a bad operator, Deeks.

40:43.656 --> 40:45.233
He's all right.

40:46.325 --> 40:48.205
- Where are you going?
- A little light workout.

40:48.369 --> 40:50.409
- Iron out some of the soreness.
- I don't think so.

40:51.580 --> 40:54.154
- We've got unfinished business.
- What are you talking about?

40:55.167 --> 40:58.085
I believe you had H-O. I had H.

40:58.254 --> 40:59.831
Have fun.

41:00.005 --> 41:02.378
No, no, no.
No, I have H and you have H-O.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.791
No, no, no.

41:05.302 --> 41:06.678
Call your shot.

41:06.846 --> 41:08.554
Strong hand. Straight in.

41:09.014 --> 41:10.888
- Nothing but net.
- Let me see.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.305
Oh, the humanity!

41:17.148 --> 41:18.179
Are you guys good?

41:18.357 --> 41:20.350
Yeah, yeah.

41:22.153 --> 41:24.026
Detective Deeks?

41:25.614 --> 41:27.073
Hetty.

41:28.492 --> 41:30.817
Who doesn't have a last name.

41:30.995 --> 41:34.328
Lange. Hetty Lange.

41:38.377 --> 41:41.711
- Can I get you anything, Ms. Lange?
- I've already had tea.

41:41.881 --> 41:44.585
Thank you. And it's "Miss."

41:45.134 --> 41:46.676
And I prefer Hetty.

41:47.344 --> 41:48.542
Hetty it is.

41:50.806 --> 41:52.550
I imagine you're still smarting

41:52.725 --> 41:56.936
from where the chief of police
just ripped you a new one.

42:00.274 --> 42:01.305
How'd you know that?

42:01.484 --> 42:06.229
Because I just experienced
something similar from my director.

42:06.739 --> 42:12.077
It seems we need to coordinate
our operations a little better.

42:12.244 --> 42:18.496
My boss wants to assign
a liaison officer from L.A.P.D.,

42:18.667 --> 42:21.668
and your boss
thinks it's a good idea.

42:21.837 --> 42:24.079
You guys don't need
a liaison officer.

42:24.256 --> 42:26.083
I agree.

42:26.842 --> 42:28.835
I told him we already have one.

42:58.415 --> 42:59.660
Who are you guys?

43:00.209 --> 43:05.085
And, I mean, how did you get
all this information?

43:06.215 --> 43:08.124
I mean,
the only thing missing here is...

43:20.354 --> 43:22.560
No need to date it.
