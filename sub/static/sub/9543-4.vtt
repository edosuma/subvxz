00:45.203 --> 00:48.262
Excuse me, sir.
There's no smoking.

00:48.297 --> 00:51.979
- We are outside.
- It's our policy. I don't make the rules.

00:52.014 --> 00:55.270
Then change your policy.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:55.305 --> 00:59.550
- We're outside, for God's sake.
- Sergei, what are you trying to prove?

00:59.585 --> 01:03.157
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to enjoy a cigarette.

01:03.192 --> 01:06.511
Sir, if you don't put that out,
I'm going to call the police.

01:06.546 --> 01:12.124
Fine. I'm putting it out. There.

01:13.221 --> 01:15.213
Are you happy?

01:17.091 --> 01:19.579
Are you happy?

01:20.131 --> 01:22.901
Is everybody happy?

01:25.486 --> 01:29.948
This is how it started
in Nazi Germany, you know?

01:31.605 --> 01:33.950
Call 911.!

01:35.233 --> 01:39.086
- Oh, my God.! He's got a gun.!
- What are you doing?

01:53.538 --> 01:56.249
MONK Season 2 Epi. 04
Mr. Monk Goes to the Circus

03:28.123 --> 03:31.016
I can't believe it!
Man, we really lucked out.

03:31.051 --> 03:34.391
- That's Adrian Monk.
- Who?

03:34.426 --> 03:36.832
He's the best crime scene
investigator in the department.

03:36.867 --> 03:38.998
We studied all his cases at the academy.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.726
Huh. Really? Never heard of him.

03:40.761 --> 03:45.075
Oh, I can't believe he's here.
It's like meeting Mick Jagger.

03:45.110 --> 03:48.313
- Oh, that's Sharona, his nurse.
- He has a nurse?

03:48.348 --> 03:49.877
When his wife was killed,
he didn't leave the house

03:49.912 --> 03:52.576
for, like, three and a half years
until he met her.

03:52.621 --> 03:56.300
Now he can't do anything without her.
She's pretty hot, huh?

03:56.335 --> 03:59.404
Oh, you think so?
Hey, maybe they're together.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.424
No. Monk's not with anyone.
He's still hung up on his late wife.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.043
That's the one case he can't solve.

04:05.078 --> 04:10.680
Look at him. Adrian Monk.!
Oh, he's the man!

04:11.742 --> 04:15.181
- Hey, there. What's your name, son?
- Myers.

04:15.216 --> 04:18.031
Officer Myers, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave the area.

04:18.067 --> 04:21.726
- Me? What did I do?
- Nothing.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.042
It's your socks.
They don't match.

04:25.077 --> 04:30.295
My socks? Wha...I lost one, sir, so I...
They're pretty close, sir...

04:30.330 --> 04:34.082
Look, I couldn't care less
about your socks. It's Monk.

04:34.117 --> 04:37.303
You're distracting him.
He can't concentrate.

04:37.338 --> 04:41.869
- What's taking so long?
- Maybe next time. - Oh.

04:43.748 --> 04:45.547
Okeydokey.
Bad man all gone.

04:45.582 --> 04:48.023
He's directing traffic on Ridgewood Avenue.

04:48.058 --> 04:50.589
- Did he understand?
- No, he didn't understand.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.156
I've known you a long time,
Adrian, and I don't understand.

04:53.191 --> 04:54.683
- Just focus on the work now.
- Okay.

04:54.718 --> 04:59.188
All right. 12:30. Place is packed.
Everybody's having a good time.

04:59.223 --> 05:02.067
The perpetrator comes down
the fire escape and leaps down.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.950
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
He leaps down?

05:03.985 --> 05:08.659
Yes, leaps down. Now, the maitre d'
is trying to call 911 on his cell phone.

05:08.694 --> 05:12.082
Comes to confront the perp.
The perp does a spin move...

05:12.117 --> 05:14.834
- Hits the phone out of the
maitre d's hand. - Really?

05:14.869 --> 05:17.313
At this point, pulls a gun,

05:17.348 --> 05:21.202
fires one round right through
the guy's heart, kill shot.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.337
From here? What is that? Thirty feet?

05:23.372 --> 05:26.307
Thirty-four.
I know. That's a hell of a shot.

05:26.342 --> 05:29.985
Look at this. - We pulled that slug
out of the planter box.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.469
- What did he use, a cannon?
- It's a.454 from a Ruger Casull.

05:33.504 --> 05:37.765
- They use it on safaris to stop elephants.
- Elephants?

05:38.019 --> 05:39.989
And who was the victim?

05:40.024 --> 05:45.907
Uh, his name is Sergei Cluvarias.
They're running it now.

05:45.942 --> 05:47.935
Table's set for two.
Who was his date?

05:47.970 --> 05:52.069
Some broad. She ran off.
We'll have a sketch soon.

05:52.104 --> 05:53.481
Uh-huh.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.752
- Where is the sugar?
- Sugar?

05:56.787 --> 06:00.988
Sugar cubes. This bowl's empty.
All the other bowls are full.

06:01.023 --> 06:07.625
- Right. What's that mean?
- I... don't know.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.102
What about the cashier?

06:09.137 --> 06:11.966
No. Showed zero interest.
This wasn't about money.

06:12.001 --> 06:14.236
Or it was, and he got scared away.

06:14.271 --> 06:18.350
- What's that?
- Wood shavings.

06:18.385 --> 06:22.062
- Wood shavings?
- Sawdust?

06:22.097 --> 06:25.365
- Randy...
- What happened next?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.694
Well, the getaway.
Which is why you're here.

06:27.729 --> 06:29.437
I thought this might
be right up your alley.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.371
- No pun intended.
- What pun is that?

06:33.406 --> 06:36.068
Because of the alley.

06:36.103 --> 06:39.031
Shecky, can I continue?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.970
All right. For once, the witnesses
are all on the same page.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.670
They all saw the perp jump
to this table...

06:44.705 --> 06:48.885
and then leaped up to this bar and did
a somersault, and then over the valet,

06:48.920 --> 06:53.024
runs down the street and makes
a left turn down the alley.

06:55.763 --> 07:00.000
- Is there a circus in town?
- Circus?

07:00.035 --> 07:01.934
Circus... That makes a lot of sense.

07:01.969 --> 07:03.197
- Sir?
- Yeah.

07:03.232 --> 07:06.119
We just got a positive on the victim.

07:06.154 --> 07:10.325
He's the master of ceremony
at the Dratch and Denby Traveling Circus.

07:11.608 --> 07:13.693
- Master of ceremony?
- Yeah, the ringmaster.

07:13.728 --> 07:17.178
- At the circus?
- Circus. - Circus.

07:20.114 --> 07:21.745
We got a winner.!

07:28.381 --> 07:30.796
Dratch and Denby Circus.

07:30.831 --> 07:33.931
Founded in 1947.

07:33.966 --> 07:39.184
They do 400 shows a year in 65
different towns. Cool.

07:39.219 --> 07:41.510
Payroll: 240 people.

07:41.545 --> 07:45.276
Yeah, that's using the term "people"
very loosely. - Ooh!

07:45.311 --> 07:50.550
- You okay?
- I'm not really in my comfort zone here.

07:50.585 --> 07:52.952
Oh, that's hot.!

07:52.987 --> 07:55.731
- You have a comfort zone?
- Yes, I have a comfort zone.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.798
- I've never seen a comfort zone.
- It's not very big. It's, uh...

07:59.833 --> 08:03.135
It's kind of... small.

08:03.170 --> 08:05.374
I-I don't have a comfort zone.

08:05.409 --> 08:08.298
- Where do we start?
- Well, we follow the gun.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.391
There's a Ruger Casull handgun
registered to an employee here.

08:11.426 --> 08:13.476
Oh, yeah. His name's Nikolai Petroff.

08:13.511 --> 08:15.665
He's, uh, one of the animal trainers.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.399
You go on ahead.
We're gonna poke around on our own.

08:18.434 --> 08:22.894
All right. Meet you back here in a bit.
Stay out of trouble.

08:25.925 --> 08:28.029
Randy...

08:30.655 --> 08:35.273
Excuse me!
Uh, can you toss me one of those?

08:36.956 --> 08:40.873
Go ahead. It's okay. Just throw it.

08:41.447 --> 08:45.129
Yep. Just go ahead and throw it.

08:45.164 --> 08:49.847
I got it.
And, throw it.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.509
- Throw it.
- Throw the ball. He says to throw it.

08:53.544 --> 08:56.841
- Throw it. Now!
- Oh!

08:57.685 --> 09:00.961
- Let's go.
- Sorry.

09:01.450 --> 09:04.647
- So what's the plan?
- We find the stables.

09:04.682 --> 09:08.576
- Why the stables?
- Missing sugar cubes.

09:08.611 --> 09:10.601
Very good.

09:21.094 --> 09:26.407
Hi. Hi, I'm... I'm Adrian Monk.
And, uh, this is Sharona Fleming.

09:26.442 --> 09:29.421
- It's a beautiful horse.
- She's a Percheron,

09:29.456 --> 09:30.963
one of the strongest horses in the world.

09:30.998 --> 09:34.047
What are you doing? What are you...
Don't... Don't touch the horse.

09:34.082 --> 09:37.706
Why not? - People sit on that.
Sweaty circus people.

09:37.741 --> 09:40.945
No offense.
You want a wipe?

09:40.980 --> 09:45.970
- Will it make you happy?
- No. Take a wipe.

09:46.675 --> 09:48.794
- What is your name?
- Ariana Dakkar.

09:48.829 --> 09:52.886
Miss Dakkar, we're investigating
the death of Sergei Cluvarias.

09:52.921 --> 09:54.594
Why talk to me?

09:54.629 --> 09:58.380
You were with him, last night, weren't you,
at the cafe when he was killed?

09:58.415 --> 10:02.175
- Who told you that?
- No one told me.

10:02.210 --> 10:07.345
You shouldn't have taken
all the sugar cubes from the table.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.886
I shouldn't have run away.
I know. But I was scared.

10:10.921 --> 10:14.354
I was sure she was going
to kill me too. - "She"?

10:14.389 --> 10:16.781
You think the killer was a woman?

10:16.816 --> 10:21.138
I don't think anything.
I know exactly who it was.

10:21.173 --> 10:24.431
I know she was crazy, but I never thought
she would try something in public.

10:24.466 --> 10:27.566
- Who?
- Natasia Lovara.

10:27.601 --> 10:30.111
She calls herself the Queen of the Sky.

10:30.146 --> 10:33.470
- An acrobat?
- Sergei's ex-wife.

10:33.505 --> 10:35.116
Jealous bitch.

10:35.151 --> 10:37.644
She couldn't stand the thought
of him having a life.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.658
If she's miserable,
everybody else has to be miserable.

10:40.693 --> 10:43.749
She tried to kill him before,
six months ago.

10:43.784 --> 10:46.327
But there wasn't enough evidence
to indict her.

10:46.362 --> 10:50.038
If you knew who did it,
why didn't you go to the police?

10:50.073 --> 10:52.518
She was afraid.

10:52.553 --> 10:56.934
You're not a citizen yet, but you're about
to take your naturalization test.

10:56.969 --> 10:59.106
She was afraid to draw
attention to herself.

10:59.141 --> 11:02.516
- How did you know that?
- That pamphlet in your bag.

11:02.551 --> 11:07.229
You're studying the U. S. Constitution,
something no citizen would ever do.

11:07.264 --> 11:09.308
Good luck, by the way.

11:09.343 --> 11:15.679
- Thank you, Mr. Monk.
- Thank you.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.720
We'll be in touch.

11:35.562 --> 11:39.706
- Nikolai Petroff?
- Who's asking?

11:39.741 --> 11:43.259
This shiny little piece of metal's asking.

11:43.294 --> 11:46.732
- Are you Nikolai Petroff?
- Are you trying to scare me? Huh?

11:46.767 --> 11:48.913
This pussycat weighs
a couple hundred pounds.

11:48.948 --> 11:52.179
It could rip me apart in a heartbeat.
I ain't scared of her.

11:52.214 --> 11:54.471
You think I'm scared of you?

11:54.506 --> 11:58.247
Excuse me.
You may not be scared of the lieutenant,

11:58.282 --> 12:00.563
but you've got plenty of reason
to be scared of me.

12:00.598 --> 12:02.528
'Cause I got a little cage
like that downtown.

12:02.563 --> 12:04.943
It's not much bigger than that, actually.
It's not a whole lot friendlier.

12:04.978 --> 12:08.218
And if you obstruct my investigation,
sir, for one moment further,

12:08.253 --> 12:09.842
you're gonna spend some time in it.

12:09.877 --> 12:13.015
- What's your name?
- Yeah, okay. I'm Nikolai Petroff.

12:13.050 --> 12:16.134
Can we make this fast?
I have a show in 30 minutes.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.670
You're not gonna cancel the show
after what happened?

12:18.705 --> 12:21.382
Most people around here are celebrating.

12:21.417 --> 12:25.171
Really? I take it Sergei wasn't
very well liked. - Not by me.

12:25.206 --> 12:27.524
Well, it's no secret.
You're gonna find out anyway.

12:27.559 --> 12:30.337
Until last week,
I was with Ariana.

12:30.372 --> 12:34.322
- The woman he was with last night.
- To hell with both of them.

12:34.357 --> 12:37.064
- What is it you do around here?
- I'm a wrangler.

12:37.099 --> 12:40.148
Anton the Great goes into the cage.
I watch his back.

12:40.183 --> 12:41.238
You watch his back?

12:41.273 --> 12:43.779
So you've got a gun in case there's
a problem? - That's right.

12:43.814 --> 12:48.010
- And that gun's a.454 Ruger Casull?
- That's right.

12:48.045 --> 12:50.970
Could we see it, please?

12:53.691 --> 12:55.599
- What happened?
- You don't know?

12:55.634 --> 12:58.166
I swear to God,
I checked it last night.

12:58.201 --> 13:02.001
Sir, sir. Just step back, please.

13:10.276 --> 13:13.142
- Where is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

13:13.177 --> 13:15.121
Phone it in. Get S. I. D.
Down here right away.

13:15.156 --> 13:17.777
You, sir, are going to have to find
somebody else to feed your kitty cat.

13:17.812 --> 13:20.018
You're coming with me.

13:23.951 --> 13:26.616
There you are.

13:26.651 --> 13:29.951
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

13:29.986 --> 13:32.383
I turned around,
and you weren't there.

13:32.418 --> 13:35.239
I like it when I turn around,
and you're there.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.184
I'm-I'm sorry. I just... I don't know.

13:37.219 --> 13:38.676
It's okay. Let's go.

13:38.711 --> 13:40.477
I think we should talk to
Natasia, the ex-wife.

13:40.512 --> 13:43.755
I've got a good feeling about her.

13:45.451 --> 13:48.108
I can't help but notice you're not moving.

13:48.143 --> 13:51.247
Are you blind?
What kind of detective are you?

13:51.282 --> 13:54.025
Can't you see that I'm upset?

13:54.060 --> 13:56.159
You said you were fine.

13:56.194 --> 13:58.523
- Impossible.
- What?

13:58.558 --> 14:01.456
What's going on?

14:04.609 --> 14:08.489
- You promise you won't laugh?
- I never laugh.

14:08.524 --> 14:12.527
- I'm scared of elephants.
- Elephants?

14:12.562 --> 14:14.382
When I was seven, I went to the zoo.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.356
I saw a baby girl fall
into the elephant pit.

14:18.141 --> 14:20.343
- And she was hurt?
- No, she was fine.

14:20.378 --> 14:23.327
They got her out. But it scared me
to death. And now, ever since then,

14:23.362 --> 14:27.588
whenever I see an elephant,
I-I-I freak out, and I start shaking.

14:27.623 --> 14:35.046
- Can't help it. I hate 'em.
- Oh, brother.

14:35.081 --> 14:39.760
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, come on, Sharona.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.755
You're not a kid anymore.
You just suck it up.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.235
We're on a job here.
I need you now.

14:45.270 --> 14:47.230
- What did you just say?
- I said, I need you.

14:47.265 --> 14:49.905
No, no, no, no, no.
Before that.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.693
Did you just tell me to suck it up?

14:53.728 --> 14:56.533
- No.
- You know, I can't believe you, Adrian!

14:56.568 --> 14:59.084
You have thousands of phobias and quirks
that I have to deal with

14:59.119 --> 15:02.378
every single day,
and I am always there for you!

15:02.413 --> 15:06.955
Aren't I? Answer the question!
Yes or no?

15:06.990 --> 15:09.367
- Yeah.
- Right! I am.

15:09.402 --> 15:11.961
And now I have just one tiny,
little problem,

15:11.996 --> 15:14.982
and you have the nerve
to tell me to suck it up?

15:15.017 --> 15:18.289
Don't you have any compassion?

15:20.128 --> 15:25.329
You're the most selfish,
inconsiderate man I have ever met.

15:25.364 --> 15:29.106
- Great. Now I'm upset.
- Oh!

15:34.784 --> 15:37.834
- Miss Lovara?
- Come in.

15:38.410 --> 15:43.923
I'm Adrian Monk.
This is my assistant, Sharona.

15:43.958 --> 15:49.008
She'll say hello later.
I'm... We're...

15:49.043 --> 15:52.524
I'm investigating the murder
of your ex-husband.

15:52.559 --> 15:56.358
Of course.
Whatever I can do.

15:56.393 --> 15:59.834
Wipe.

15:59.869 --> 16:03.587
Suck it up.

16:03.622 --> 16:07.597
Okay. Anyway,
sorry to hear about Mr. Cluvarias.

16:07.632 --> 16:10.148
If you are sorry,
you didn't know him.

16:10.183 --> 16:13.066
I understand it was
not an amicable separation.

16:13.101 --> 16:17.994
Sergei was a terrible husband.
And a terrible ex-husband.

16:18.029 --> 16:21.438
But he's an excellent late husband.

16:21.473 --> 16:24.204
No. It was not, as you say, amicable.

16:24.239 --> 16:28.056
It would be foolish of me to pretend
otherwise. Everyone here knows how I felt.

16:28.091 --> 16:31.281
I should warn you, ma'am. Anything you
say can be used as evidence against you.

16:31.316 --> 16:35.034
- Are you taking notes?
- No.

16:36.524 --> 16:39.350
- Is this you?
- Da.

16:39.385 --> 16:42.680
And, uh...
And you're also a sharpshooter?

16:42.715 --> 16:46.470
- Mm-hmm.
- Where were you last night, Miss Lovara?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.757
I was here, alone.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.861
I was reading. Tolstoy.

16:51.896 --> 16:54.938
Uh-huh. This book?

16:54.973 --> 16:59.003
The spine hasn't been cracked.
No bookmark. No pages folded over.

16:59.038 --> 17:01.022
How do you know where you stop?

17:01.057 --> 17:03.782
I remember where I stopped.

17:03.817 --> 17:06.684
Could you excuse us?

17:07.962 --> 17:09.040
- Get away from me.
- Come on.

17:09.076 --> 17:11.751
Call the captain.
Tell him to meet us here. She's the guy.

17:11.786 --> 17:15.304
Motive. No alibi. And...
she already tried to kill him once.

17:15.339 --> 17:19.080
Mr. Monk. If you would like me
to come with you,

17:19.116 --> 17:21.750
all you have to do is ask.

17:21.785 --> 17:23.102
If you wouldn't mind.

17:23.137 --> 17:28.189
Not at all.
If you wouldn't mind getting the door.

17:38.988 --> 17:41.278
A leopard and panther wrangler?

17:41.313 --> 17:43.203
Yep. He works with the leopards
and the panthers,

17:43.238 --> 17:47.621
and he's got a.454 Ruger Casull handgun,
which he says he can't find.

17:47.656 --> 17:50.165
He had the hots for the horse trainer
the vic was seeing.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.552
And get this...
He's a trapeze artist wannabe.

17:53.587 --> 17:56.213
He's been practicing.
They say he's pretty good.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.585
And that's how we spell "primary suspect."

17:58.620 --> 18:02.326
Hmm. He's left-handed.

18:03.562 --> 18:05.568
Well, yeah. He works in the circus.

18:05.603 --> 18:07.145
What's that supposed to mean?

18:07.180 --> 18:10.436
They're freaks. They're all
ambidextrous. - Says who?

18:10.471 --> 18:14.316
Circus people are ambidextrous.
I read that somewhere.

18:14.351 --> 18:16.128
I like the ex-wife.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.685
You should have seen her.
She's cold as ice.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.708
Cold as ice with a broken foot.

18:19.743 --> 18:21.329
She's got a bad temper.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.335
A bad temper with a broken foot.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.949
You keep coming back to the foot.

18:24.984 --> 18:28.865
Monk, the killer did a somersault
and then ran away in front of witnesses.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.120
That's precisely why I think it's her.

18:31.155 --> 18:35.660
Why else would the killer jump around
like that in front of witnesses?

18:35.695 --> 18:40.846
There's only one reason...
to prove...

18:40.881 --> 18:44.420
prove that she could.

18:46.770 --> 18:49.314
Suck it up.

18:50.337 --> 18:54.785
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

18:55.976 --> 18:57.789
- Fine.
- Okay.

18:57.824 --> 19:00.357
As I was saying,
she has a broken foot.

19:00.392 --> 19:02.910
It's in a cast.
We don't know if it's really broken.

19:02.945 --> 19:04.997
We haven't exactly been
sleeping here, Monk.

19:05.032 --> 19:07.995
- Lieutenant?
- Her story checks out.

19:08.030 --> 19:11.955
She broke her left foot two weeks ago
in Kansas City.

19:11.990 --> 19:16.259
She, uh, always ended the show with
something she called the triple tailspin.

19:16.294 --> 19:18.676
You know, it's a specialty move.

19:18.711 --> 19:23.592
Anyway, she, uh, missed the bar
or something...and fell 25 feet...

19:23.627 --> 19:28.510
in front of 750 pretty freaked-out people.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.771
She missed the net?

19:36.806 --> 19:39.057
She never used a net.

19:39.092 --> 19:42.583
- She go to the hospital?
- No. She's a Romany Gypsy.

19:42.618 --> 19:44.994
They don't believe in doctors.
She set the bone herself.

19:45.029 --> 19:46.547
So she never saw a doctor.

19:46.582 --> 19:49.367
Which means a doctor never saw her.

19:49.402 --> 19:52.366
- Captain!
- All right, Monk.

19:52.401 --> 19:56.307
Lieutenant, see if our Queen of the Sky
will consent to an X-ray.

19:56.342 --> 19:58.332
- Fine.
- Thank you.

19:58.367 --> 20:01.143
You're welcome.

20:01.598 --> 20:04.690
You want to finish it?

20:06.361 --> 20:09.866
You know, when Karen and I
were having trouble last year,

20:09.901 --> 20:13.281
we went to a marriage counselor...
guy named Mosely. Decent guy.

20:13.316 --> 20:16.848
He didn't help us much, but I'm sure
Karen has the number if you'd like...

20:16.883 --> 20:20.357
We're not married.
And if we ever get married, shoot me.

20:20.392 --> 20:24.331
You know who you should never marry?
The Elephant Man.

20:24.366 --> 20:28.191
I'd marry the Elephant Man
before I'd marry you!

20:39.877 --> 20:43.311
"S. I. U." Know what that means? "S. I. U"

20:43.346 --> 20:45.790
Yes, I know what it means.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.628
- Here it is.
- Ah!

20:48.663 --> 20:52.392
- So, is it really broken?
- No, it's not broken.

20:52.427 --> 20:53.996
Hah!

20:55.140 --> 20:58.555
It's shattered... completely.

20:58.590 --> 21:03.075
The radiograph indicates multiple fractures
of the tarsal and metatarsal bones...

21:03.110 --> 21:06.072
- consistent with a crush-type injury.
- Ooh.

21:06.107 --> 21:11.951
There are also fractures along the tibia and
fibula at the medial and lateral malleoli.

21:11.986 --> 21:13.300
Ow.

21:13.335 --> 21:14.864
What happened to her?

21:14.899 --> 21:17.584
She fell 25 feet from a trapeze.

21:17.619 --> 21:20.188
- That would do it.
- Doctor, let me ask you something.

21:20.223 --> 21:24.018
Somebody with an injury like this... could
they do a somersault and run away?

21:24.053 --> 21:27.008
That's impossible.
The pain would kill her.

21:27.043 --> 21:28.913
She couldn't even hobble away.

21:28.948 --> 21:32.058
What if she took pills?
Painkillers?

21:32.093 --> 21:34.975
Well, we took a blood
test before the X-ray.

21:35.010 --> 21:36.394
Came up negative.

21:36.429 --> 21:43.513
- No drugs, no painkillers. She's clean.
- Thank you.

21:50.534 --> 21:53.539
What are you doing?
You don't smoke.

21:53.574 --> 21:55.374
Do now.

21:55.409 --> 22:00.214
This is a hospital, for God's sake.
You can't smoke in here.

22:00.249 --> 22:02.543
So?
Suck it up.

22:02.578 --> 22:04.344
Okay.
I'll suck it up.

22:04.379 --> 22:07.185
You two stay here.
I'll bring the car around.

22:07.220 --> 22:09.686
No, I'm going with you.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.047
Mr. Monk. Do you mind?

22:15.082 --> 22:17.604
I can't open it myself.

22:17.639 --> 22:19.433
Can't you?

22:19.468 --> 22:23.832
You saw the X-rays.
Do you have any other questions?

22:23.867 --> 22:29.005
Just one. How did you do it?

22:29.040 --> 22:31.692
I like you, Mr. Monk.

22:31.727 --> 22:35.244
You appear to be a careful
and cautious man.

22:35.279 --> 22:38.947
But inside, in your mind,
you're like me.

22:38.982 --> 22:44.766
You are up there working without a net,
risking everything.

22:44.801 --> 22:47.889
It is the only way to live.

22:47.924 --> 22:50.550
Am I right?

22:56.250 --> 22:58.829
Steady. Steady. No, no.

23:01.924 --> 23:06.245
All right.
Natasia, over here.

23:07.301 --> 23:10.526
- Heinz.
- Uh, thank you.

23:10.561 --> 23:11.703
Thank you for coming.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.911
What did you want to see me about?

23:13.946 --> 23:16.078
Did your girlfriend forget the routine?

23:16.113 --> 23:19.696
No. I just wanted you
to know I got your back.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.709
Don't worry.
I would never tell anyone.

23:23.744 --> 23:27.271
Tell them about what, Heinz?

23:27.306 --> 23:30.359
You know, about how you did it.

23:30.394 --> 23:33.732
How I did what?

23:33.767 --> 23:37.097
Well, uh, my trailer is over there.

23:37.132 --> 23:39.036
A couple nights ago,
I couldn't sleep.

23:39.071 --> 23:44.106
I looked out of the window,
and, uh, I saw you.

23:44.141 --> 23:47.107
Come on.
Don't make me say it.

23:48.734 --> 23:52.411
Look, I've always thought
you were a smart woman, Natasia.

23:52.446 --> 23:56.342
Very smart, very pretty.

23:56.377 --> 23:58.581
What do you want?
Money?

23:58.616 --> 24:03.547
Money? What would I do with money?
No, I...

24:03.582 --> 24:08.204
I just want to spend time with you.
I... I like you.

24:08.239 --> 24:13.345
Heinz, but I like you too.

24:13.380 --> 24:16.942
Oh... Mm-hmm.
I think we've got a lot to talk about.

24:16.977 --> 24:21.468
- Maybe I can buy you a drink?
- I would like that.

24:21.503 --> 24:25.512
- Tomorrow, after the matinee.
- I'll come to your tent.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.852
No, no, no, no.
Better I meet you here.

24:28.887 --> 24:34.444
- There's something I want to show you.
- Good. Good.

24:40.128 --> 24:44.466
Hello? - It's me, Adrian.
Adrian Monk, y-your boss.

24:44.501 --> 24:47.770
- I know. What do you want?
- I'm at the circus.

24:47.805 --> 24:49.414
I thought that you were
gonna meet me here.

24:49.449 --> 24:52.468
I told you I was taking the day off.

24:52.924 --> 24:55.980
- Are allowed to do that?
- No, so fire me.

24:56.015 --> 24:59.095
Please. It'll be my birthday present.

25:00.769 --> 25:03.726
- Got your flowers.
- Oh, good. Good.

25:03.761 --> 25:06.440
- The card was blank.
- I know. I...

25:06.475 --> 25:11.092
I didn't know what to say,
so I just... I just left it blank.

25:12.353 --> 25:15.772
- How did you know they were from me?
- All the same height.

25:15.807 --> 25:18.919
And all the flowers have the exact same
number of petals on 'em.

25:18.954 --> 25:21.164
Yeah, look, uh...

25:22.128 --> 25:26.346
Sharona, I-I just wanted to say
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

25:26.381 --> 25:28.301
That's not good enough.

25:28.336 --> 25:35.352
- I'm very, very, very, very sorry...
- You just don't get it.

25:38.264 --> 25:41.765
Yes, I do.
No, I... I don't.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.633
It's not that easy.
You can't just apologize.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.422
You have to really think
about how you treat me, Adrian.

25:47.457 --> 25:49.665
You really hurt me and
you have to try to understand...

25:49.700 --> 25:52.901
Wait. There she is. I gotta go.

25:52.936 --> 25:55.245
Be careful.

25:59.858 --> 26:04.167
Please don't...
don't do that.

26:14.816 --> 26:17.602
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

26:17.637 --> 26:20.715
Don't worry about them.
They know how to fall.

26:20.750 --> 26:25.436
That's the first thing we learn.
You brought your camera, Mr. Monk.

26:25.471 --> 26:28.360
Oh, sure. I love it here. It's so upbeat.

26:28.395 --> 26:32.776
You hate it here.
You think I can walk.

26:32.811 --> 26:37.492
- You're trying to catch me.
- You're right. I was.

26:37.527 --> 26:40.619
You saw the X-rays, Mr. Monk.
How can I walk on this?

26:40.654 --> 26:42.697
I'm curious.
What is your theory?

26:42.732 --> 26:46.744
Some people have
a very high threshold for pain.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.127
They can take it.

26:49.162 --> 26:53.140
Nice try. But any doctor will tell
you it's impossible.

26:53.175 --> 26:57.679
Besides, I was married to
Sergei for 15 years.

26:57.714 --> 27:01.170
It's enough pain for a lifetime.

27:01.205 --> 27:03.766
You fell two weeks ago, is that right?

27:03.801 --> 27:07.852
- Mmm. Your point?
- Your cast.

27:07.887 --> 27:10.137
Looks... Looks like new.

27:10.172 --> 27:13.141
No scuff marks.
It's not even discolored.

27:13.176 --> 27:17.522
Again, nice try.
My old one was itching.

27:17.557 --> 27:20.756
Ah. - So I put a new one
on four days ago.

27:22.996 --> 27:26.711
The show is about to begin,
you are missing it.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.207
You're wrong, Natasia.
I'm not missing a thing.

27:30.242 --> 27:34.474
The lights are coming on in the big top.!
Hurry up, folks.! Take your seats.!

27:34.509 --> 27:40.008
- So, how-how's the case coming?
- Good.

27:40.043 --> 27:43.516
Not good. Bad.

27:43.551 --> 27:47.404
I have a suspect.
She doesn't even deny she did it.

27:47.439 --> 27:50.156
- But I can't prove a thing.
- Hmm.

27:50.191 --> 27:54.148
- Well, how-how's that make you feel?
- Angry.

27:54.183 --> 27:59.041
Okay, so what do you do
when you feel angry?

27:59.076 --> 28:01.651
I get mad.

28:01.686 --> 28:08.494
Adrian, you've had tough cases before.
You usually don't get this rattled.

28:08.529 --> 28:10.345
What's going on with you and Sharona?

28:10.380 --> 28:13.846
She's still not talking to me.
She says I don't get it.

28:13.881 --> 28:17.804
- Well, I think maybe she's right.
- What don't I get? I don't understand.

28:17.839 --> 28:21.348
- I can't tell you that.
- You mean,

28:21.383 --> 28:24.218
you know, but you won't tell me?

28:24.253 --> 28:27.391
Adrian, you're gonna have to figure
this one out for yourself.

28:27.426 --> 28:32.351
I'm sorry. Uh...
I want to make sure I understand this.

28:32.386 --> 28:36.357
I have a problem.
You know the answer.

28:36.392 --> 28:39.600
- That's right.
- I'm paying you.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.213
- That's right.
- But you won't tell me.

28:42.248 --> 28:49.130
That's right.
Adrian, the answer is inside you.

28:49.165 --> 28:53.199
No, Doctor.
The answer is inside you.

28:53.234 --> 28:56.252
If you told me, I would hear it,

28:56.287 --> 29:00.145
and then the answer would be inside me!

29:01.497 --> 29:04.434
- What do you got?
- Bingo.

29:04.631 --> 29:06.731
What exactly does "bingo" mean, Randy?

29:06.766 --> 29:11.265
We got the murder weapon...
454 Ruger Casull.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.237
- Well, that's been fired recently.
- Any prints?

29:21.272 --> 29:24.604
Nope. It's been oiled down.
How'd it get in there?

29:24.639 --> 29:26.150
It's the backup cannon.

29:26.185 --> 29:28.074
Cannonball guy says anybody
could have dropped it in.

29:28.109 --> 29:30.335
- They haven't used it in a week.
- Backup cannon?

29:30.370 --> 29:34.372
Good Lord. Get that down to Ballistics.
Put it on the fast track.

29:35.243 --> 29:37.307
Excuse me.
Are you guys about done?

29:37.342 --> 29:40.131
Sir, could you please step back?
This is official police business.

29:40.166 --> 29:42.638
Maybe I should come to your office
and root through your stuff.

29:42.673 --> 29:45.921
How'd you like that? Huh?

29:45.956 --> 29:48.187
I hate that cannonball.

29:48.222 --> 29:50.549
Benjy, bring your bike around back.!

29:50.584 --> 29:56.577
How many times do I have to tell you?
God...

29:57.987 --> 30:00.082
- Adrian.
- Hello. It's me, Adrian.

30:00.117 --> 30:03.489
I know.
I'm looking right at you.

30:03.524 --> 30:08.949
Listen, Sharona. Uh, I've been
thinking about it. You know, "it"?

30:08.984 --> 30:13.207
And, uh, I just want to say...

30:14.906 --> 30:19.030
"About your fear of elephants...
I was way out of line.

30:19.065 --> 30:23.648
"I shouldn't have belittled you just
because you were being...

30:23.683 --> 30:27.338
irrational."

30:28.190 --> 30:29.936
Is that it?

30:30.900 --> 30:32.006
Uh-oh.

30:32.041 --> 30:37.220
My fear is irrational?
As opposed to... to what... your fears?

30:37.255 --> 30:41.639
Well, the stuff I'm afraid of is,
you know, based on fact.

30:41.674 --> 30:44.606
- It is?
- Like germs.

30:44.641 --> 30:47.277
Like, uh, crooked paintings?

30:47.312 --> 30:51.376
And-And sidewalk cracks?
And-And food touching?

30:51.411 --> 30:54.602
- And the wind?
- Hey, the wind can kill.

30:54.637 --> 30:58.152
- Hurricane Edna?
- Milk?

30:58.187 --> 31:00.788
At least they're things people
actually encounter.

31:00.823 --> 31:03.005
You have to make an appointment
to see an elephant.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.793
You have to sign up for
a safari or something.

31:06.828 --> 31:11.787
You don't get it, and you never will.

31:13.146 --> 31:15.674
- I'm gonna go play some video games.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:15.709 --> 31:16.859
Don't forget about your bike.

31:16.894 --> 31:19.772
If you don't do it,
your mom's gonna have to do it.

31:19.807 --> 31:22.848
- Just give her a break.
- Okay.

31:24.192 --> 31:27.643
- What did you say?
- Noth... Nothing.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.709
No. No, no, no.
Don't be scared. It was good.

31:30.744 --> 31:35.029
You said, "Let's give her a break."
That was empathy.

31:35.064 --> 31:39.748
That means you're
thinking about how I felt.

31:39.783 --> 31:41.762
I think you're getting it now.

31:41.797 --> 31:45.551
I am. So, we're back to
where we were.

31:45.586 --> 31:51.125
No.
But it's a start.

31:53.461 --> 31:56.447
Burundi! Foot.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.233
Steady, steady.
No, no. No, no.

31:59.268 --> 32:03.065
Ungawa.! Ungawa.!

32:07.200 --> 32:09.386
Back.

32:34.219 --> 32:38.883
Dede, bend down.
That's a good girl.

32:44.518 --> 32:47.290
Good girl. Good.

32:49.777 --> 32:52.329
- Why are you dragging me back here?
- Well, you'll see.

32:52.364 --> 32:54.408
Have a little faith, okay?

32:54.443 --> 32:56.666
Oh, no, no. Adrian, are you crazy?

32:56.701 --> 33:00.275
What are you doing? - Come on. All right.
Look, I spoke to the trainer earlier.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.793
I told him about your problem. And we
just thought that if you met the elephant,

33:03.828 --> 33:09.597
if you got to know her,
maybe you could get over your... fear.

33:09.632 --> 33:14.291
Thank you, but I can't.
I can't and I won't. I'm not doing this.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.795
- Mr. Monk. - Yeah.
- Hi, hi. Is this your friend?

33:16.830 --> 33:20.656
Yes. This is Sharona Fleming.
This is Edgar Heinz.

33:20.691 --> 33:25.279
- Hi. - - Hi.
- Right. And this... is Dede.

33:25.314 --> 33:29.035
There's... There's nothing to be afraid of,
Miss Fleming. Nothing.

33:29.070 --> 33:35.830
Look. See?
I'm petting her. Me.

33:35.865 --> 33:39.589
I'm petting her. - Elephants are very
passive. They're like children.

33:39.624 --> 33:43.656
Dede wouldn't hurt a fly. Really.

33:43.691 --> 33:46.624
Now you pet her. - I can't believe you
did this. I can't believe...

33:46.659 --> 33:50.673
Come on. You don't...
You don't want to end up like me.

33:51.084 --> 33:55.806
If... If I can do it, anybody can do it.

33:55.841 --> 33:59.180
Come on. Come on.

34:02.063 --> 34:05.796
There you go. Just... Just like I did.

34:05.831 --> 34:10.973
Go ahead. G-Go ahead.

34:11.864 --> 34:15.206
- Come on.
- Oh, she likes you.

34:15.241 --> 34:18.675
She likes you. - Uh, we're just about to
rehearse a couple of tricks.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.034
- Would you like to watch?
- Sure. Sure.

34:21.069 --> 34:23.387
I really don't want to do this.
I don't want to... - Yeah. Good. Good.

34:23.422 --> 34:29.139
Dede, back.
Back.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.040
- Ungawa.!
- I don't want to do this.

34:32.074 --> 34:38.264
Burundi!! Ungawa.!

34:39.389 --> 34:43.800
And now, for the grand finale!

34:53.070 --> 34:58.378
Oh, God. - Come on, now.
Don't worry. He knows what he's doing.

35:00.545 --> 35:05.872
Dede... - Burundi.!

35:05.907 --> 35:11.251
Ungawa.!
Dede, ungawa.

35:13.007 --> 35:14.724
Oh, my God!

35:16.081 --> 35:17.139
Ooh.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.158
Here you go.
Do you want to sleep?

35:25.193 --> 35:28.819
I can't. Every time I close my eyes,
I see it again. I...

35:28.854 --> 35:32.306
- Oh, it was so horrible.
- It's okay. I'm right here.

35:32.341 --> 35:36.095
I'll take care of you.
Ah, one hot cocoa coming up.

35:36.130 --> 35:39.403
Here. I'm gonna put on
some music for you.

35:39.438 --> 35:43.582
- Thank you, Adrian.
- Oh. You kidding?

35:43.617 --> 35:45.508
It's the least I could do.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.400
You've been there for me every day.

35:48.435 --> 35:51.412
And I spoke to that woman
from animal control.

35:51.447 --> 35:54.344
She said it was just a freak accident.

35:54.379 --> 35:57.615
The odds against it were a thousand to one.

35:57.650 --> 36:00.691
I really don't want to talk about it.

36:00.726 --> 36:06.552
Good idea. Sorry.
Is, uh... Is this a dollop?

36:06.587 --> 36:12.392
What? - A dollop. It says,
"Add one dollop of whipped cream."

36:12.427 --> 36:14.481
I don't know.
I think a dollop's, like, a teaspoon.

36:14.516 --> 36:17.208
Yeah, it doesn't say "teaspoon."
It says "dollop."

36:17.243 --> 36:19.727
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't have to be exact.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.645
I-I-It's like a pinch.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.773
How many pinches to a dollop?

36:23.808 --> 36:28.034
- I don't know.
- Well, maybe it's more like a schmear.

36:28.069 --> 36:35.382
I think it's three pinches to a schmear.
Or, uh... Ah, forget it.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.588
Forget it!
Let's make something else.

36:37.623 --> 36:39.412
What? You're throwing it out?

36:39.447 --> 36:43.343
Nobody can make this cocoa.
The recipe's impossible.

36:44.164 --> 36:47.082
Fine. I'll do it.

36:47.117 --> 36:49.284
Yeah, maybe you should do it.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.687
You mind if I sit down?

36:56.722 --> 36:59.232
What do you want in your cocoa?

36:59.267 --> 37:01.610
Do you have any of those
little marshmallows?

37:01.645 --> 37:04.234
- How many? Ten?
- Eight.

37:05.490 --> 37:08.603
I'll have eight.

37:08.638 --> 37:15.377
- Eight's good. Make it eight.
- Here.

37:16.505 --> 37:21.419
One... - There's eight.
You don't have to count.

37:21.454 --> 37:25.060
Four, five, six...

37:25.095 --> 37:29.141
- What?
- A thousand to one?

37:29.176 --> 37:31.182
What's a thousand to one?

37:31.217 --> 37:34.366
The odds of an elephant doing that.

37:34.401 --> 37:38.814
- What?
- It wasn't an accident.

37:38.849 --> 37:44.280
Energy! Phillipe, you're dragging
your feet! Point your toes!

37:45.860 --> 37:50.123
- Let's do it again!
- Excuse me.

37:50.158 --> 37:52.051
- Natasia Lovara?
- Da.

37:52.086 --> 37:54.446
I need to ask you one or two questions.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.599
If this is about my ex-husband,
you're wasting your time.

37:56.634 --> 37:58.265
This isn't only about Sergei, ma'am.

37:58.300 --> 38:03.175
You're also the suspect in the murder of
Edgar Heinz, the elephant trainer.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.386
Don't be ridiculous.

38:05.421 --> 38:08.796
- That was an accident. Tragic.
- No.

38:08.831 --> 38:14.886
It was homicide, premeditated, and we have
the murder weapon right here. Lieutenant!

38:21.121 --> 38:25.654
You waited for Mr. Heinz to put his head
under Dede's foot. - What?

38:25.689 --> 38:28.987
And then you gave the command
for the elephant to stomp.

38:29.022 --> 38:33.094
She is well trained, weighs over four tons.

38:33.129 --> 38:34.731
A perfect killing machine.

38:34.766 --> 38:37.494
Adrian, Adrian. I got to go.
Just tell me what happened.

38:37.529 --> 38:39.539
Tell me what...

38:39.574 --> 38:41.996
But I was nowhere near the pen
when it happened.

38:42.031 --> 38:43.312
That's true.

38:43.347 --> 38:48.626
You weren't there. You gave the command
from across the midway over a walkie-talkie.

38:48.661 --> 38:54.223
Oh. - Lieutenant, could you check
behind the elephant's ear?

38:56.895 --> 39:01.291
Got it. - Careful with that, Randy.
We need the prints.

39:01.326 --> 39:06.413
Why kill Edgar Heinz?
Well, you had no choice.

39:06.448 --> 39:11.244
He knew that you had murdered your
ex-husband... that Monday night.

39:11.279 --> 39:13.743
Mr. Monk, you are demented.

39:13.778 --> 39:16.482
Nevertheless, you did it.

39:16.517 --> 39:21.090
Excuse me. I'm...
I'm summing up the case here.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.939
The killer ran away.
My foot is broken.

39:23.974 --> 39:26.115
You saw the X-ray.

39:26.150 --> 39:28.759
All week I've been asking
the wrong question.

39:28.794 --> 39:31.360
I've been asking if your foot was broken.

39:31.395 --> 39:36.970
I should have been asking
when your foot was broken.

39:37.632 --> 39:39.816
It's true...
You fell during a show two weeks ago.

39:39.851 --> 39:44.124
But it wasn't an accident.
You said it yourself...

39:44.159 --> 39:46.991
the first thing you learn is how to fall.

39:47.026 --> 39:51.104
I'm guessing it was one of the best
performances of your life, Natasia.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.670
And your fear of hospitals
came in quite handy.

39:53.705 --> 39:59.367
There was no X-ray. Everyone just accepted
the fact that your foot was broken.

39:59.402 --> 40:05.049
- What is your problem?
- Hey, clown.! Take a walk.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.973
The night of the murder,
you slipped out of your cast...

40:11.008 --> 40:15.104
and followed your ex-husband
and his girlfriend.

40:15.139 --> 40:18.355
You waited until they were
in a crowded restaurant.

40:18.390 --> 40:20.730
You needed witnesses
to see you running.

40:20.765 --> 40:24.350
That was the key to your plan.

40:24.385 --> 40:28.489
I wasn't there,
but I heard you were dazzling.

40:28.524 --> 40:31.848
You really are the Queen of the Sky.

40:32.290 --> 40:35.195
An interesting theory, Mr. Monk.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.485
Perhaps you'd like to X-ray my foot again.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.403
No need for that.
I'm quite sure it really is broken.

40:42.438 --> 40:44.805
- Good.
- Now.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.265
You knew you'd be a suspect,
and you knew that we'd want an X-ray.

40:48.300 --> 40:53.090
It's not an easy thing to do...
breaking your own foot.

40:54.878 --> 40:57.213
After the murder, you came back here.

40:57.248 --> 40:59.393
It was late. Everyone was sleeping.

40:59.428 --> 41:02.888
Dede, ungawa.!

41:06.474 --> 41:09.211
Everyone except Dede's trainer.

41:09.246 --> 41:15.024
His trailer was right there.
He probably woke up and looked outside.

41:15.693 --> 41:18.157
Can't somebody do something
about this clown?

41:18.192 --> 41:24.804
Look, I'm a police officer. Knock it off.
Go ahead.

41:24.839 --> 41:29.445
Like Tolstoy, you know how to tell
a clever story. But you need proof.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.756
The elephant isn't talking.

41:31.791 --> 41:34.136
Anyone could have put
that radio thing in her ear.

41:34.171 --> 41:37.222
Randy, take that down to
the laboratory straightaway.

41:37.257 --> 41:40.216
I don't think they'll find any prints.
She's too smart.

41:40.251 --> 41:43.306
I'm sure she wiped it down.

41:43.341 --> 41:47.189
Then again, that walkie looks brand new.

41:47.224 --> 41:50.272
Which means she had to put batteries in it.

41:50.307 --> 41:55.571
You did remember to wipe your prints off
the batteries, didn't you, Natasia?

41:55.606 --> 41:58.779
- Wocka wocka!
- All right. That's it, freak!

41:58.814 --> 42:00.553
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

42:00.588 --> 42:03.362
For impersonating an officer!

42:04.023 --> 42:07.874
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!
Get her! Get her!

42:13.262 --> 42:16.540
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:18.227 --> 42:21.728
Don't move!
Go, go!

42:21.763 --> 42:25.694
...batteries!

42:25.729 --> 42:30.026
Are you all right?
You must have been so frightened.

42:30.061 --> 42:34.322
See, I'm empathizing with you.
I'm putting myself in your shoes.

42:34.357 --> 42:35.392
Will you shut up?

42:35.427 --> 42:39.299
Okay, now that's you getting annoyed
at me because I won't shut up.

42:39.334 --> 42:43.366
So I'm... That's me being
compassionate and sensitive.

42:43.401 --> 42:45.238
- I... I feel your pain.
- Oh, God.

42:45.273 --> 42:47.678
- I'm feeling your pain.
- I've created a monster.

42:47.713 --> 42:52.033
I hear that.
I'm hearing what you're saying.

42:52.267 --> 42:55.342
See, Mom?
I told you she was friendly.

42:55.377 --> 42:59.305
- How do you feel?
- Good. I think I'm over it.

42:59.340 --> 43:03.518
Maybe there's hope for you.

43:03.553 --> 43:05.721
- Ugh!
- What's wrong?

43:05.756 --> 43:08.238
I think I stepped in something.

43:08.273 --> 43:10.675
- Where?
- It's right here.

43:10.710 --> 43:15.010
- I don't see anything.
- I definitely stepped in something.

43:15.045 --> 43:18.500
- I have to go home.
- We just got here.

43:18.535 --> 43:21.042
- I want to go home.
- Just suck it up.

43:21.077 --> 43:22.546
I don't think it's my turn to suck it up.

43:22.581 --> 43:23.912
I think it's your turn to suck it up.

43:23.947 --> 43:25.539
Hey, why don't you both suck it up?

43:25.574 --> 43:28.075
Excuse me.
Do you kiss your mom with that mouth?

43:28.110 --> 43:31.687
- No.
- You should. Come here.

43:31.722 --> 43:34.795
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.
