00:32.720 --> 00:35.280
And on that point,
members of the jury...

00:35.400 --> 00:37.391
...I rest my case.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.833
<i>(camera shutter clicks)</i>

01:01.920 --> 01:03.273
<i>(alarm clock rings)</i>

01:29.080 --> 01:31.036
Hello, Wanda.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.833
Hi, Ken.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.109
Hello, W-W-Wanda.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.433
Ken...

02:46.360 --> 02:47.315
...this is Otto.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.954
Hello, Ken.
Wanda's told me a lot about you.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.195
Hey! Great fish!

02:52.400 --> 02:55.437
A squeeze of lemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

02:56.360 --> 02:58.032
George back yet?

02:58.160 --> 03:00.071
No, he had to g-g-go...

03:00.200 --> 03:02.430
...to the b-b-b...

03:05.080 --> 03:06.115
What?

03:06.240 --> 03:09.676
That's quite a stutter you've got there,
Ken.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.394
<i>(laughs)</i>
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.114
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.035
A cup of tea, Ken?

03:17.160 --> 03:18.957
Y-y-y...

03:19.080 --> 03:20.638
Yeah, he'd like one.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.320
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.953
Cost him his life, dammit.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.513
<i>(door opens)</i>

03:28.080 --> 03:29.832
Hi, George.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.877
Hello, George.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.069
Get you a Scotch?

03:34.200 --> 03:35.758
Yeah.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.835
George...

03:38.080 --> 03:39.433
...this is Otto.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.993
So...

03:42.120 --> 03:43.792
...you're Wanda's brother?

03:43.920 --> 03:45.319
Good to be here, George.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.158
England is a fine country.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.032
Did she tell you what we need?

03:54.080 --> 03:55.035
<i>(Ken gasps)</i>

03:57.880 --> 03:59.632
<i>(Otto)</i> Something like that?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.036
Something like that.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.033
Hello, Wendy.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.674
Had a good day?

04:11.520 --> 04:14.671
I spend the morning
<i>trying</i> to get a waste disposal man.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.110
At lunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband...

04:18.240 --> 04:21.072
...then I have to play
<i>three</i> rubbers with Philippa.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.998
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.633
Oh, no!

04:26.920 --> 04:28.478
Would you like some tea?

04:29.480 --> 04:30.674
Yes.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.359
I won the case.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.790
This is the first moment
I've had to myself all day.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.037
Hello, Portia! How was the show?

04:42.160 --> 04:44.355
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.438
- But you liked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.630
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.228
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.794
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.150
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'll do it!

05:00.280 --> 05:01.633
I won the case.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.796
Now this is cracked.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.192
They're worth about 100,000 each.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.432
There are 135 of them.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.028
That makes 13 millions, my friends.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.275
Dollars or pounds?

05:14.400 --> 05:15.355
Pounds, pet.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.232
This is the big one. So...

05:19.480 --> 05:21.357
OK.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.550
Yeah.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.557
Otto?

05:25.680 --> 05:26.908
Yes?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.268
OK?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.355
What?

05:29.480 --> 05:30.595
The plan.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.718
Yeah. Great. No problem.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.159
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

05:37.440 --> 05:40.273
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

05:40.400 --> 05:40.912
Yeah, yeah!

05:41.040 --> 05:42.871
I haven't finished yet.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.675
Because the police will watch
all the airports for 72 hours.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.676
I know.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.755
I know.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.428
Do you want me to g-g-get...

05:52.560 --> 05:54.835
...a b-b-big...

05:54.960 --> 05:57.918
...c- c-car?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.359
Getaway?

05:59.480 --> 06:00.833
A limo, OK?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.916
And put diplomatic plates on it.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.349
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.914
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.632
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.036
So, next week...

06:13.160 --> 06:15.116
...we won't have to look for work.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.231
And it won't have to look for us.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.236
Oscar Wilde.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.068
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.872
What's the attraction?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.592
Because you can t-t-t...

06:30.720 --> 06:34.030
...trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

06:34.160 --> 06:35.229
Shit on you?

06:35.360 --> 06:37.669
Show off all the time.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.109
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.629
He said they were God's second blunder.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.909
Bye, sis!

06:44.400 --> 06:47.790
Well, you tell him from me that I-I-I...

06:48.600 --> 06:49.828
Bye, George.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.035
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.116
- OK.
- (Don't let him touch you.)

06:55.240 --> 06:57.276
One more day, and we're together.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.356
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.993
I know he's insensitive.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.518
He's had a hard life.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.993
Dad used to beat him up.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.593
Good.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.675
Aaagh!

07:14.960 --> 07:16.951
<i>(screaming)</i>

08:35.080 --> 08:37.035
Anybody moves and you're dead.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.956
<i>(alarm rings)</i>

09:04.000 --> 09:05.956
<i>(dogs yap)</i>

09:07.080 --> 09:08.957
Look where you're going!

09:09.080 --> 09:10.638
Chauvinist pig!

09:10.760 --> 09:14.070
Really, people here
just think they own the pavement.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.314
<i>(engine starts)</i>

09:22.000 --> 09:24.070
<i>(brakes screech)</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:42.229
That was fun.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.998
I love robbing the English.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.156
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

09:46.280 --> 09:47.838
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

09:47.960 --> 09:49.188
We didn't hit the dog.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.949
- $20 million and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

09:53.080 --> 09:56.231
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

09:56.360 --> 09:57.315
<i>(George)</i> Shut up!

09:57.440 --> 09:58.759
<i>(siren)</i>

10:03.160 --> 10:04.434
Ken.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.035
Bye!

10:37.480 --> 10:38.595
Let's split.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.156
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie low. No celebrating.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.713
No celebrating?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.072
See you in a couple of hours.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.709
To $20 million.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.909
To a job well done.

11:36.040 --> 11:36.995
To us.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.839
To the best
brother and sister team since...

11:39.960 --> 11:41.029
Romeo and Juliet?

11:41.480 --> 11:44.836
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

11:44.960 --> 11:45.915
What morons!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.270
- I want you to know something.
- What?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.710
Even if you were my brother,
I'd still want to fuck you.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.795
Oooh!

11:54.480 --> 11:55.959
Make the call.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.638
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

11:57.760 --> 11:59.273
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

11:59.400 --> 12:00.355
Hey!

12:00.480 --> 12:03.677
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.268
- E linguine primavera...
- No. No.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.437
- Una cotoletta di vitello.
- Make the call, Otto.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.993
Are you really Italian?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.599
Absolutamente. Si!

12:12.720 --> 12:14.517
My name is Otto. It means eight.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.232
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.270
Bye, George.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.311
<i>(ltalian accent)</i> The police, please.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.032
Otto!

12:22.080 --> 12:23.957
<i>(English accent)</i> Yes, hello.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.038
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may like to know...

12:27.160 --> 12:32.188
...that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.835
He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions...

12:35.960 --> 12:39.270
...Murray Road, London W9.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.189
Wanda!

12:51.560 --> 12:53.516
<i>(siren)</i>

13:03.480 --> 13:05.755
<i>(banging on door)</i> Police! Open up!

13:06.640 --> 13:08.278
Come on, open up!

13:12.520 --> 13:14.988
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

13:24.840 --> 13:26.592
George Francis Thomason?

13:38.280 --> 13:39.633
Passport...

13:39.760 --> 13:40.909
...tickets...

13:41.040 --> 13:41.995
...money!

13:46.480 --> 13:47.833
<i>(honks horn)</i>

13:47.960 --> 13:49.598
<i>(Otto)</i> Asshole!

13:49.720 --> 13:51.358
<i>(crashing)</i>

13:59.240 --> 14:00.832
We're rich, Wanda.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.029
Yep?

14:02.160 --> 14:03.798
I bet these weeks with me...

14:03.920 --> 14:06.798
...have been
the most exciting weeks of your life.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.069
You said it.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.911
<i>(breathes deeply)</i>

14:20.480 --> 14:21.435
<i>(calmly)</i> OK.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.832
OK.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.439
Disappointed!

14:26.880 --> 14:28.233
Sonofabitch!

14:29.080 --> 14:31.640
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

14:31.760 --> 14:33.034
Shut up.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.720
People are always
taking advantage of me!

14:35.840 --> 14:38.035
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.869
What are you doing?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.956
I'm thinking!

14:44.080 --> 14:45.832
Thinking what I'll do to him.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.996
I'll hang him up with piano wire...

14:48.120 --> 14:51.078
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.029
Talk to who?

14:53.480 --> 14:54.595
Talk to who?!

14:54.720 --> 14:57.553
So, while installing these windows...

14:57.680 --> 15:01.309
...you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.589
That's right, sir.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.597
Your parents can confirm this?

15:04.720 --> 15:05.994
Yes, and his aunt...

15:06.120 --> 15:07.633
...Georgina Thomason.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.749
Good, Bartlett.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.233
- <i>(knock at door)</i>
- Yes?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.752
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.950
Thomason. A young lady to see you.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.311
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

15:18.440 --> 15:19.759
No, absolutely not.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.835
George!

15:20.960 --> 15:23.520
Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.

15:23.640 --> 15:24.789
- Thanks.
- De nada.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.592
What do you think, Mr Leach?

15:26.720 --> 15:30.713
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else will they come up with?

15:34.880 --> 15:35.949
<i>(wolf whistling)</i>

15:41.040 --> 15:42.792
Oh, George!

15:42.920 --> 15:45.639
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.671
That's not allowed in here, miss.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.949
Are you OK?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.229
It's all right.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.237
I don't think I can handle this.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.715
I was too afraid to sleep last night...

15:54.840 --> 15:56.637
Leave it out, leave it out, OK?

15:57.680 --> 15:59.398
Listen, listen, listen.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.999
Listen.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.036
You stayed at my place.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.991
We slept late.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.076
You made me breakfast.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.032
What?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.037
What's he doing here?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.037
He wanted to see you.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.796
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

16:21.920 --> 16:23.876
Do you want me to rub him out?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.956
Anything, you name it.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.355
I have friends making enquiries.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.038
Good.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.754
The jewels are very safe.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.589
If I get sent down, it all gets
handed back to cut my sentence.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.995
Now, to cut my sentence even more...

16:39.120 --> 16:41.475
...I could tell them who done it with me...

16:41.600 --> 16:44.239
...if I wasn't very happy about everything.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.797
What was the middle thing?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.876
Piss off.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.835
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

17:00.880 --> 17:02.233
George?

17:03.480 --> 17:05.038
You don't think...

17:05.160 --> 17:06.718
Do you?

17:06.839 --> 17:07.795
No!

17:11.040 --> 17:11.994
No.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.154
No!

17:14.280 --> 17:16.077
OK.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.189
- George.
- What?

17:19.240 --> 17:21.674
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.438
Trust me.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.311
Thank you very much.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.953
Thanks a lot. Bye.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.229
Have a good day.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.275
So?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.799
He's not sure it was you.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.875
What about you?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.353
No, no, he believes me.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.835
That's why he can't figure out about you.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.949
Figure out what?

17:40.080 --> 17:42.548
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

17:43.480 --> 17:45.436
Don't er...

17:45.560 --> 17:48.233
...ever, ever, <i>ever...</i>

17:48.360 --> 17:49.952
...call me stupid. OK?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.355
What?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.598
That's George's lawyer.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.675
The other guy must be the barrister.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.395
So?

18:04.520 --> 18:05.635
Trust me.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.509
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

18:11.640 --> 18:12.834
Excuse me.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.598
Don't I recognise you?

18:15.680 --> 18:17.716
No. No, I don't think so.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.432
Oh.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.949
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

18:22.480 --> 18:23.833
Erm...

18:23.960 --> 18:25.916
Well, hardly.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.315
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

18:30.280 --> 18:31.599
Yes, yes, certainly.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.675
Thanks.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.519
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.595
I'm American.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.675
Oh, really?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.439
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.516
What er... What brings you here?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.596
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.676
I... have a friend.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.028
Oh!

18:48.160 --> 18:49.115
I see.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.275
There you are.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.355
I knew it!

18:51.480 --> 18:52.993
You're Archie <i>Leash.</i>

18:53.120 --> 18:54.075
Leach.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.235
Right.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.759
I saw you in court!

18:56.880 --> 18:58.836
Er... two weeks ago.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.234
The casino break-in?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.918
You were great!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.996
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.872
I love the way you er...

19:06.000 --> 19:07.433
...cross-examine.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.829
Oh, I really admire your work.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.915
Thank you.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.150
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

19:16.280 --> 19:18.236
No? Fine, right.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.315
Well...

19:19.440 --> 19:20.953
Thank you for this.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.354
I'll treasure it.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.756
Au revoir.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.432
You speak French, too!

19:49.800 --> 19:51.472
What's going on?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.990
Whatever George decides to do,
he'll tell Leach first.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.473
Why?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.113
Because he's his lawyer.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.309
Yeah, I know that.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.556
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.678
So George will tell <i>him</i>
where the diamonds are?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.995
That's what I'm going to find out.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.914
You done well, my son.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.115
Now, where are we going to hide it?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.429
<i>(inaudible)</i>

20:26.560 --> 20:27.959
Very good!

20:28.080 --> 20:29.752
Don't tell Wanda anything.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.030
Otto might get something out of her.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.115
Now...

20:33.240 --> 20:34.832
George.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.712
You are going to g-get off?

20:36.840 --> 20:38.796
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.875
We'll fix it.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.479
Now, anything on Otto?

20:41.600 --> 20:43.397
No. Not yet.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.232
You watch him.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.072
Ken!

20:51.880 --> 20:53.029
OK.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.233
Looks like the police have been all over it.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.238
Let me change clothes,
then I'll help you look.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.832
<i>(English accent)</i> Hello...

21:01.960 --> 21:03.996
...K- K-Ken's p-p-pets.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.636
Hey!

21:06.680 --> 21:08.432
Wake up!

21:08.560 --> 21:09.834
Wake up, limey fish!

21:12.080 --> 21:15.390
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this lawyer?

21:15.520 --> 21:17.511
I don't know. I'll improvise.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.433
Fucking insects!

21:19.560 --> 21:23.235
I thought Englishmen didn't like women,
the way they talk.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.429
No!

21:24.560 --> 21:29.076
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.952
Have you got the hots for him?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.674
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.153
<i>(laughs)</i>

21:35.280 --> 21:37.669
What is this? Hump-a-limey week?

21:37.800 --> 21:39.358
Otto doesn't approve.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.038
Otto might get jealous.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.597
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.237
Molto pericoloso...

21:54.280 --> 21:55.349
Carissima.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.038
Oh, speak it, speak it!

21:57.800 --> 22:00.598
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

22:01.480 --> 22:06.270
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.833
Dov'ê la farmacia?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.632
Yes, yes, yes!

22:09.760 --> 22:10.715
No, no, no.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.273
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.549
No, not here.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.715
Otto, not here.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.193
Dov'ê la Fontana di Trevi?

22:16.320 --> 22:17.355
Not here, Otto!

22:17.480 --> 22:18.754
Erm...

22:18.880 --> 22:19.835
Mozzarella...

22:19.960 --> 22:21.075
Er... Parmigiana...

22:21.200 --> 22:24.033
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

22:24.160 --> 22:25.912
<i>(silence)</i>

22:28.080 --> 22:29.115
Wanda!

22:35.080 --> 22:37.036
Look what I've got, Wanda.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.433
Treasure!

23:07.480 --> 23:08.833
Ssh!

23:23.440 --> 23:24.236
Aaagh!

23:24.360 --> 23:25.873
Ooh!

23:26.000 --> 23:27.513
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

23:27.640 --> 23:29.596
I thought it was the police again.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.676
Isn't it horrible about George?

23:31.800 --> 23:35.031
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

23:35.160 --> 23:36.388
<i>- (clattering)</i>
- Shit.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.478
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.239
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.749
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

23:51.480 --> 23:52.356
Isn't it terrible about George?

23:52.480 --> 23:55.438
When I find the bastard who squealed!

23:55.560 --> 23:56.913
I love that man!

23:57.880 --> 23:59.632
What are you d-d-doing here?

24:00.600 --> 24:01.794
What am I doing here?

24:01.920 --> 24:04.992
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.235
Sh...

24:06.600 --> 24:09.194
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.598
I've got to speak to you.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.676
<i>(Wanda wails)</i>

24:14.800 --> 24:15.994
Are you OK, now, sis?

24:16.120 --> 24:19.237
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- Call me if you need me.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.478
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.636
Something f-f-funny is going on.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.113
Oh dear, oh dear.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.310
You don't know why you're excited.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.953
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

24:32.080 --> 24:35.516
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.471
Isn't it time you faced facts?

24:37.600 --> 24:39.033
Come on!

24:40.080 --> 24:41.877
You're a very attractive man.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.315
You're smart.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.396
You've got wonderful bones...

24:45.520 --> 24:48.114
...great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

24:48.240 --> 24:48.911
Wh-wh-wh...

24:49.040 --> 24:51.076
We could have a lot of fun together.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.873
I think we'd be really good for each other.

24:54.000 --> 24:54.955
What do you say?

24:56.800 --> 24:58.438
You must be j-j-j...

24:58.560 --> 24:59.675
May I kiss you, Ken?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.153
No, you fucking can't!

25:01.280 --> 25:02.793
Just a peck! No tongue!

25:02.920 --> 25:03.875
No, no!

25:04.000 --> 25:06.514
<i>(Otto)</i> Ken! Ken!

25:09.760 --> 25:10.954
Ken!

25:11.080 --> 25:13.275
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.356
OK, no, look.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.435
I'm sorry.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.357
I've handled this badly.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.516
Look, the physical side can wait.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.038
You need time.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.273
Will you think about it?

25:48.360 --> 25:49.713
Oh, my God.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.836
Oh, my God!

25:53.960 --> 25:55.552
Ken!

25:55.680 --> 25:57.318
Somebody just called!

25:57.440 --> 25:59.192
They said that the police...

25:59.320 --> 26:01.709
No, that the loot
is in a garage in Fulham.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.637
You and I have to go get it now.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.990
We have to move it
before the police find it.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.075
No, no, no...

26:07.200 --> 26:09.031
- What?
- It's all right!

26:09.160 --> 26:11.116
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge...

George...

26:12.880 --> 26:14.029
M-m-m...

26:14.160 --> 26:16.037
...moved...

26:16.160 --> 26:18.037
George moved the loot?!

26:18.160 --> 26:19.593
Yes.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.273
Where did he move it, Ken?

26:21.400 --> 26:23.038
Where did he move it?!

26:23.720 --> 26:25.676
C-c-c...

26:34.880 --> 26:38.031
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.115
It's in...

26:41.400 --> 26:42.355
Don't tell me.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.550
It's better that you don't tell me.

26:45.880 --> 26:49.395
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

26:53.840 --> 26:55.319
Otto...

26:56.880 --> 26:58.632
...tried to k-k-k...

26:58.760 --> 27:00.034
...kiss me.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.438
I thought he might.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.633
No.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.716
Nothing, no marks at all.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.796
But it is a safety deposit box key?

27:11.920 --> 27:14.275
Yes, but there are millions of them...

27:14.400 --> 27:16.152
...hotels, banks, offices.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.429
Sorry.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.834
Thank you.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.152
(Fuck!)

27:36.480 --> 27:37.993
That's him.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.076
That's him, Inspector.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.714
He's the one

- 12.30, sir.

28:08.040 --> 28:08.995
Right.

Come in!

28:20.880 --> 28:22.757
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

Am I interrupting?

28:24.840 --> 28:26.273
Absolutely not.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.355
Really?

28:27.480 --> 28:29.277
Really. Delighted to see you.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.355
Hello.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.435
So.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.433
This is the place.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.629
- This is it.
- Very nice.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.991
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

28:42.120 --> 28:43.758
Really, so much to know,

Everybody wears these. Do you?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.877
- Oh, ridiculous!

28:51.080 --> 28:52.035
Well, erm...

28:54.360 --> 28:55.315
I'm sorry.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.000
But until then,
I'm all yours, as they say.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.156
I just have a couple of questions.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.956
I'm having a little problem...

29:03.080 --> 29:06.231
...understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.514
What exactly is the committal?

29:09.640 --> 29:10.709
Ah. Interesting.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.912
Basically,
it's a preliminary investigation...

29:14.040 --> 29:16.679
...where the prosecution
presents evidence...

29:16.800 --> 29:19.030
...that the accused has a case to answer.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.037
That's what it says in the book.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.118
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.389
Right.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.438
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

29:28.800 --> 29:29.755
Yes.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.949
George Thomason?

29:31.880 --> 29:33.598
Yes. Do you know him?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.833
I'm defending him.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.678
What are you talking about?

29:38.800 --> 29:40.791
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.639
That's so great!

29:45.080 --> 29:47.150
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

29:47.280 --> 29:50.511
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

29:50.640 --> 29:51.595
Thank you.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.517
He's sure to get off now.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.833
Wow!

29:56.480 --> 29:58.038
I can watch you work now!

29:58.160 --> 29:59.752
Please.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.949
Amazing.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.274
Well, anyway.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.153
At the committal,
George would then plead...

30:07.280 --> 30:08.952
Not guilty.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.069
Really?

30:10.200 --> 30:13.078
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.555
But wasn't there an identification?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.511
True, but a very elderly lady.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.710
I think they've got the wrong man.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.232
You don't think he did it?

30:23.360 --> 30:24.315
No.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.829
Let's just say, for argument's sake...

30:26.960 --> 30:28.712
...that you did think he did it.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.877
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to light.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.955
Right, right.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.277
You would then advise him
to plead guilty...

30:36.400 --> 30:40.075
...and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.668
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

30:44.680 --> 30:46.318
Theoretically, yes, yes.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.395
Oh, of course.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.589
Erm. Well er...

30:50.080 --> 30:53.311
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

30:55.040 --> 30:55.995
Wanda.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.997
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.076
Well, Wanda, there are three...

31:05.160 --> 31:06.434
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.437
Yes.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.357
Oh, my God.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.469
What?

31:11.600 --> 31:12.749
You're his alibi.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.871
I can't talk to you!

31:15.000 --> 31:15.955
Why not?

31:16.080 --> 31:18.435
My dear lady, you're a defence witness!

31:18.560 --> 31:20.596
I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.278
What did I say?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.960
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.991
Everybody does it in America.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.758
Not in England, it's forbidden.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.275
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.356
I'm sorry. Please.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.472
Oh, Archie.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.439
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.232
Come on, you know!

31:50.720 --> 31:52.915
You knew the minute I walked in here.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.518
I want you.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.308
What?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.358
<i>(intercom buzzes)</i>

32:02.480 --> 32:04.152
- Hello?
<i>- Sir John is here.</i>

32:04.280 --> 32:05.429
Show him in, please.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.232
Make love with me.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.952
<i>- Pardon?</i>
- Nothing.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.640
- Will you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.799
Bye, Uncle.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.831
Hi!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.991
<i>(rousing music)</i>

32:38.080 --> 32:40.196
He's pleading not guilty...

32:40.320 --> 32:42.436
...so you're safe until the trial.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.991
Leach doesn't think he did it.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.640
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key...

32:49.760 --> 32:52.115
...but only George knows where it is.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.034
Thank you, Wanda(!)

32:57.400 --> 32:59.356
What have <i>you</i> found out?

32:59.480 --> 33:00.674
Not a lot.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.950
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.229
I know that!

33:04.360 --> 33:05.759
So nothing, huh?

33:05.880 --> 33:06.835
Nix.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.034
Zip.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.639
Diddly.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.193
Bupkiss.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.594
Niente.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.229
Oh, it's too big!

33:21.360 --> 33:23.669
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

33:23.800 --> 33:25.950
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

33:26.080 --> 33:27.638
No! Absolutely not!

33:27.760 --> 33:30.228
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

33:30.360 --> 33:31.509
Do shut up, Portia!

33:32.880 --> 33:35.872
All I get, all day,
is people complaining to me.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.877
Oh dear.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.316
Ecco I'uomo.

34:02.720 --> 34:06.633
Ooh, le due cupole grandi
della cattedrale di Milano.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.911
Benito Mussolini!

35:04.480 --> 35:06.311

Archie, I want <i>you</i> to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.348
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd listen to me.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.232
I want you to speak to Portia.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.555
I'll speak to her in the morning.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.033
Goodnight, Archie.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.752
Goodnight, Archie!

35:54.280 --> 35:55.998
Goodnight, Wanda.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.833
Goodnight, who?

35:59.080 --> 36:02.629
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow...

36:02.760 --> 36:04.716
...with some lousy old hag.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.832
Are you George Francis Thomason...

36:07.960 --> 36:10.520
...of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue...

36:10.640 --> 36:11.834
...London W9?

36:13.280 --> 36:14.474
Yes, sir.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.478
The charge is one of armed robbery.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.716
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

36:19.840 --> 36:23.230
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.634
That is correct, 6.2.

36:24.760 --> 36:28.150
Here are the statements,
all to be fully bound, please.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.071
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.475
You are committed to stand trial...

36:33.600 --> 36:36.160
...at the Central Criminal Court.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.635
There is some urgency about this case.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.512
The main witness, Mrs Coady...

36:40.640 --> 36:44.838
...is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.758
Is there any possibility
that this case...

36:47.880 --> 36:50.155
...might be put down for an early trial?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.748
That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.952
Take him down to the cell, please, officer.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.272
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.391
You look great. I love your hair.

37:18.520 --> 37:19.839
Got time for a coffee?

37:19.960 --> 37:22.269
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

37:22.400 --> 37:23.833
Why did he give you this?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.996
<i>Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.</i>

37:26.120 --> 37:28.634
Does he want you to send her flowers?

37:28.760 --> 37:29.749
Do her shopping?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.074
Show her a good time?

37:31.200 --> 37:33.031
Rub her out?

37:36.080 --> 37:38.036
He wants you to rub her out?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.273
He's going to kill her!

37:41.400 --> 37:42.276
<i>(laughs)</i>

37:44.480 --> 37:46.357
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.949
Limey fruits!

37:49.880 --> 37:52.758
So the old lady will
m-meet with an accident?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.950
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

37:55.080 --> 37:57.036
<i>(laughs)</i>

37:57.160 --> 37:58.673
What's so funny?

37:58.800 --> 38:02.031
Nothing.
Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.197
Well, it's better than b-buggering people.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.911
I bet you £1 you don't kill her.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.355
All right.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.755
All right.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.949
I love watching your ass when you walk.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.672
Is that beautiful or what?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.439
Don't go near him!

38:19.560 --> 38:21.073
He's mine!

38:21.960 --> 38:24.030
£1 says you won't kill her!

38:24.160 --> 38:25.991
<i>(laughs)</i>

38:27.280 --> 38:28.759
When could you look at it?

38:28.880 --> 38:32.316
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.238
I'll look at it then
and call you on Saturday.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.669
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

38:37.800 --> 38:38.755
Hi.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.156
I know we're not allowed to talk.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.508
Give me a call.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.789
I can't.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.035
Please?

38:46.160 --> 38:48.151
We're not allowed to speak.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.838
We don't have to.

38:50.880 --> 38:54.589
I don't want you for your conversation.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.511
I'd love to...

39:04.160 --> 39:06.116
<i>(wails)</i>

39:07.840 --> 39:09.956
<i>(continues howling)</i>

39:10.680 --> 39:12.955

- Got a date, Friday.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.150
<i>(whistles)</i>

39:27.240 --> 39:28.832
<i>(dogs yap)</i>

39:28.960 --> 39:30.439
Look here!

39:30.560 --> 39:33.199
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

39:33.320 --> 39:35.276
My dogs will be having their nap.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.277
Nice doggy.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.515
Nice... doggy.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.756
<i>(snarling)</i>

39:56.080 --> 39:57.593
Otto, what are you doing?

39:57.720 --> 40:00.154
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.157
It focuses your aggression.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.919
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.996
What kind of Buddhism is this?

40:08.680 --> 40:09.635
<i>(honks horn)</i>

40:10.560 --> 40:11.515
<i>(crashing)</i>

40:11.640 --> 40:13.153
Asshole!

40:14.080 --> 40:16.355
It's an early Tantric meditation...

40:16.480 --> 40:17.799
What is this?

40:17.920 --> 40:21.708
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.434
Well, we're ready now, at last.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.516
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.359
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- Marvellous.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.435
Be good.

40:31.240 --> 40:34.710
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

40:34.840 --> 40:36.637
Cordial? Courteous?

40:36.760 --> 40:37.988
Supportive? What?

40:38.120 --> 40:40.634
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

40:42.080 --> 40:45.152
So, friendly might include actual er...

40:45.280 --> 40:46.599
...what, penetration?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.597
I don't need your jealousy now.

40:48.720 --> 40:49.914
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.032
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

41:01.840 --> 41:03.637
What about my tits?

41:03.760 --> 41:05.193
Does he get to handle them?

41:05.320 --> 41:08.039
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'll stand by that.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.275
Nuzzling?

41:09.400 --> 41:11.595
I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.869
80 chance there.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.560
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.070
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.349
One thing, though.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.755
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

41:27.600 --> 41:30.160
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.679
Aren't we going, then?

41:31.800 --> 41:33.313
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

41:45.480 --> 41:46.833
(Hurry up.)

42:02.760 --> 42:04.716
Hi.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.637
Do you despise me?

42:12.080 --> 42:14.548
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.436
Can I stay, then?

42:22.160 --> 42:23.513
Of course. Look...

42:24.680 --> 42:26.113
- Wanda...
- I know.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.753
Your wife's coming back.

42:27.880 --> 42:30.030
No, it's not her. She'll be hours.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.957
It's about what I said to you.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.911
It <i>is</i> all right for us to speak.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.029
It is?

42:35.160 --> 42:37.674
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.629
Oh.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.149
Oh, fine.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.555
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

42:43.680 --> 42:45.432

There you are, dear. Cheers.

Nice to see you again.

- Whose car is it?

That's correct, ma'am.

...before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

46:51.840 --> 46:56.072
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.111
We're debriefing him as of now...

46:58.240 --> 46:59.559
...and we're just er...

- For KGB.

47:04.200 --> 47:06.350
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

No er... No, not now.

Well, why are you telling everyone?

47:26.800 --> 47:28.518

and you want me to give it back...

54:16.280 --> 54:18.475
<i>- I</i> don't want...
- They can't have it.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.555
- Wendy.
- No. No!

54:19.680 --> 54:21.238
- Wendy!
- NO!

54:21.360 --> 54:22.952
Tell them they can't have it!

54:23.080 --> 54:24.957
You're the bloody barrister!

54:58.280 --> 54:59.759
- Hello.
- Hello.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.636
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.796
It's just beautiful.

55:09.120 --> 55:10.997
Oh, my God, look!

55:12.680 --> 55:14.716
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.239
Isn't it wonderful?

55:16.360 --> 55:17.759
Whose is it?

55:17.880 --> 55:20.189
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.469
And where are they?

55:22.280 --> 55:23.508
Hong Kong.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.595
Ah so.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.236
Gone for weeks.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.430
Nice rug, Archie.

55:30.880 --> 55:32.233
May I?

55:34.760 --> 55:36.432
Archie, what are you doing?

55:36.560 --> 55:37.709
The polka, I think.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.116
You make me feel free!

55:44.240 --> 55:45.753
Free?

55:45.880 --> 55:49.555
Do you have any idea
what it's like being English?

55:49.680 --> 55:51.955
Being so correct all the time?

55:52.080 --> 55:57.473
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

55:57.600 --> 55:59.875
Asking someone, 'Are you married? '...

56:00.000 --> 56:01.956
...and hearing, 'My wife left me.'

56:02.080 --> 56:04.435
Or saying,
'Do you have children? '...

56:04.880 --> 56:07.792
...and hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday.'

56:07.920 --> 56:11.754
Wanda, we're all terrified
of embarrassment.

56:12.560 --> 56:15.120
That's why we're so... dead.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.111
Most of my friends are dead.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.708
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.156
But you're alive, God bless you.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.840
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with all this.

56:28.680 --> 56:31.069
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.795
I'm a good lover.

56:32.920 --> 56:36.515
At least, I used to be
in the early 14th century.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.956
Can we go to bed?

56:45.080 --> 56:46.479
Yeah.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.596
Hang on!

56:49.720 --> 56:51.836
Mind your head.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.352
Agh! Aagh!

56:54.480 --> 56:56.232
Aaagh! Aaagh!

56:58.280 --> 57:00.032
I think I love you, Wanda.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.116
Oh, Archie.

57:02.240 --> 57:04.117
Can I ask you a question?

57:04.240 --> 57:05.195
Anything.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.276
Where's my locket?

57:07.400 --> 57:08.469
I couldn't get it.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.715
What?

57:09.840 --> 57:11.990
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

57:12.120 --> 57:13.633
I got you this instead.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.512
Do you like it?

57:15.640 --> 57:18.234
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.999
What's the matter? Why?

57:21.880 --> 57:24.314
My mother gave it to me...

57:24.880 --> 57:29.237
...on her death... bed.

57:29.360 --> 57:31.157
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.633
All right, darling.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.193
I'll get it for you.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.275
You promise?

57:35.400 --> 57:36.913
I'll think of something.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.235
Sex is very, very difficult for me...

57:39.360 --> 57:42.432
...with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

57:43.080 --> 57:44.957
I promise I'll get it. OK?

57:45.880 --> 57:48.553
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

57:49.680 --> 57:53.878
<i>(Wanda)</i> I've loved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

57:54.000 --> 57:54.955

57:56.000 --> 57:57.558
What was that?

57:57.680 --> 57:59.193
What?

57:59.320 --> 58:02.198
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

58:02.320 --> 58:03.833
No.

58:03.960 --> 58:05.029
He's no idea?

58:05.680 --> 58:07.830
He doesn't have a clue.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.075
What?

58:09.880 --> 58:10.915
He is so dumb...

58:11.040 --> 58:11.995
Really?

58:12.120 --> 58:15.999
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where Lincoln lived.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.075
<i>(laughter)</i>

58:19.000 --> 58:23.118
Those terrible lies
he told about the CIA!

58:23.240 --> 58:24.195
So painful!

58:24.320 --> 58:27.357
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia...

58:27.480 --> 58:30.233
...he said,
'Why did they name her after a car? '

58:30.360 --> 58:32.316
<i>(hysterical laughter)</i>

58:35.080 --> 58:36.638
I love the way you laugh!

58:37.280 --> 58:39.157
I love you, you're funny.

58:40.680 --> 58:44.150
How come a girl as bright as you...

58:44.280 --> 58:46.350
...can have a brother who's so...

58:46.480 --> 58:48.072
Don't call me stupid.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.155
<i>(screaming)</i>

58:49.280 --> 58:51.350
Jesus Christ!

58:58.080 --> 59:00.150
Ouch! Otto!

59:00.280 --> 59:01.349
Come on!

59:02.480 --> 59:04.391
I'll deal with you later!

59:05.280 --> 59:06.952
What have you done with her?

59:07.080 --> 59:09.640
- She's all right!
<i>- (banging at door)</i> Otto!

59:09.760 --> 59:11.512
Now, apologise.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.710
What?

59:13.840 --> 59:15.398
Apologise!

59:15.520 --> 59:16.714
<i>(Wanda)</i> Shit!

59:16.840 --> 59:19.070
Are you totally deranged?

59:23.880 --> 59:26.030
You pompous...

59:26.160 --> 59:28.594
...stuck-up, snot-nosed...

59:28.720 --> 59:30.870
...English, giant twerp...

59:31.000 --> 59:34.675
...scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

59:34.800 --> 59:36.916
How very interesting.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.315
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

59:39.440 --> 59:41.510
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

59:41.640 --> 59:42.595
Now, apologise!

59:43.640 --> 59:45.710
What? <i>Me</i> to you(?)

59:50.280 --> 59:52.236
Apologise.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.353
All right, I apologise.

59:54.480 --> 59:55.708
You're really sorry?

59:55.840 --> 59:57.353
I'm really, really sorry.

59:57.480 --> 59:59.152
I apologise unreservedly.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.029
You take it back?

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.958
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.868
The imputation was <i>totally</i>
without basis in fact...

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.956
...and was in no way fair comment.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.196
It was motivated purely by malice.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.197
I deeply regret any distress...

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.118
...my comments
may have caused you or your family.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.958
I hereby undertake not repeat...

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.470
...any such slander
at any time in the future.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.194
OK.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.832
<i>(screams)</i>

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.393
<i>(church bells toll)</i>

<i># Miserere Dominus</i>

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.795
<i># Miserere Dominus</i>

<i># Canis mortuus est...</i>

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:40.833
You said you loved him!

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.352
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.436
A. Wanda was lying.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.516
B. Wanda was telling the truth.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.517
Which one are you going to pick?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.278
What was the first one?

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.277
You said you were not seeing him!

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.277
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.709
I was dealing with something delicate.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.035
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.958
He knows where the loot is
and if you'll be arrested.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.514
You lope in
like Rambo without a jockstrap...

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.312
...and dangle him from a window!

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.431
Now, was that smart?!

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.278
Was it shrewd?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.834
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.118
Don't call me stupid.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.555
Oh, right!

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.513
To call you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.949
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.116
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.232
You think you're an intellectual,
don't you, ape?

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.957
Apes don't read philosophy.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.755
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.519
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.631
Aristotle was not Belgian.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.475
The central message of Buddhism...

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.353
...is not every man for himself.
- You read...

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.711
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.035
Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.799
Now. You have just assaulted...

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.469
...the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.909
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.996
What would an intellectual do?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.072
What would Plato do?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.033
(Apologise.)

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.957
Pardon me?

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.035
(Apolo... )

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.115
What?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.835
Apologise!

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.915
Right!

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.633
I'm sorry.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.233
No.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.315
Not to me.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.793
To Archie.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.229
And make it good, or we're dead.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.239
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.315

No.

OK... Iceland?

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.794

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.759
I don't know.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.632
Why do I like you so much?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.715
Archie.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.795
Hm?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.512
Do you speak Italian?

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.595
I am Italian!

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.870

<i>(stutters)</i>

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.310
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.830
I'll just sit here and eat my chips
till you tell me.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.839
The English contribution to world cuisine.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.678
The chip.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.633
What do the English
usually eat with chips...

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.955
...to make them more interesting?

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.198
Wait a moment!

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.157
It's fish, isn't it?!

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.037
Here, boy.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.069
Down the hatch.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.195
Delicious!

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.675
You b-b-b...

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.552
Better eat the green one? OK?

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.555
What's this one's name?

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.796
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.592
I'm going to call her Lunch.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.790
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.032
Eugh!

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.116
Avoid the green ones.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.798
They're not ripe yet.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.878
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.989
Yes, sir.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.430
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was installing windows...

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.232
...the previous weekend...

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.957
...would explain the presence of
small particles of glass on his trousers.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.516
No hurry, Inspector.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.153
Please do take your time.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.189
I'm almost full.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.353
Almost.

What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.994
The Airway Sheraton?

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.075
The Post House?

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.474
The Cathcart Towers?

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.556
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.474
Mm? Mm?

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.189
Yes.

Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.630
Still, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

Oh!

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.949
- Hello?
- I know where the diamonds are.

Where's the key?

I've got it.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.309
When can you get
to George's apartment?

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.551
You are Wanda Gershwitz...

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.309
...of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.317
Yes.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.078
Would you tell the court...

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.156
...how do you know the defendant?

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.078
We've had a relationship for two years.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.552
Relationship?

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.069
We're lovers, your lord.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.236
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:48.716
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year...

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.159
...in the morning...

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.315
...where were you?

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.396
At the apartment at Murray Road.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.751
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.150
No. Somebody else was there.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.713
Who was that?

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.193
My brother.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.275
Did your b...?

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.038
Your brother?

My brother.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.554
Yes.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.479
Yes, and...

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.029
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.515
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.518
She's had a relationship
with him all her life.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.834
<i>(subdued laughter)</i>

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.073
Much obliged, my lord.

W-w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.396
Yes, George was there.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.873
But he left about 6.55.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.592

...how can you be so sure?

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.793
Oh, I looked at the clock.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.473
Cos I said to myself...

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.195
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun? '

Ah, you made it. Good.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.272
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.952
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.152
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.633
I'll see you in court.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.035
Yes.

Well.

George.

- What?
- We've got to talk.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.711
Tell those pigs to fuck off.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.068
Fuck off, pigs.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.759
Did you hear what I said?

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.835
Fuck off.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.553
What's she up to, George?

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.749
What are you up to?

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.432
You called her darling...

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.629
...and Wanda.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.718
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.909
It slipped out.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.712
Have you been coaching her?

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.354
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.436
They'll find you guilty, right?

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.916
Plead guilty now, tell them
where the loot is, you may get...

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.235
...eight years, out in five and a half.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.715
What if I tell them about Otto...
and Wanda?

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.838
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.029
Great, all right.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.912
Maybe six years, out in four?

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.759
So where are the diamonds?

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.518
Where's Bartlett?

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.517
Upstairs, calming things down.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.755
So, where are they?

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.474
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.719
George, it'd be a lot quicker
if you told me.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.757
OK! I'll tell Bartlett.

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.552
Where's Ken?

- Buenos Aires.

- We're going to George's flat first.

Check the briefcase for mine.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.273
Get your head down.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.310
So, you robbed the jeweller's,
turned one lover in...

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.159
...and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.840
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.712
Everyone does it in America.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.034
Not in this country!

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.196
Right(!) Nobody lies in England.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.279
- Like Margaret Thatcher never lied.
- You lied to me from the start.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.915
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I fell in love with you!

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:28.153
How come you dumped me, then?

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.236
