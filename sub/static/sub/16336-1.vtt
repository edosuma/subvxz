WEBVTT

00:31.640 --> 00:33.404
A fly-

02:21.520 --> 02:23.124
- Are they from Ciudadela?
- Yes.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.727
- The mussels are from Menorca?
- Yes.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.571
Okay. For three people...
One kilo.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.964
- Lluis.
- How are you?

02:54.160 --> 02:55.650
What are you doing here?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.243
I'm buying things for my mom.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.442
- How is she?
- Great.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.369
Did you cut your hair?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.210
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.327
This is Tim.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.642
He got here two days ago.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.966
Perfect.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.171
Okay, see you around.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.169
Say hi to your mom for me.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.600
I will.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.880
Can you put the mussels
in a bag for me?

03:49.360 --> 03:51.727
- Anything else?
- Yes.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.563
Give me 200 grams.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.685
Is that Miguel Angel?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.086
What are they doing?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.283
I'm going to stop for a second.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.209
- We got lucky.
- Yeah.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.362
I ran out of gas.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.282
- How are you?
-l'm going to the airport.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.970
Can you give us a ride
to the gas station?

07:00.160 --> 07:03.482
Hold on, I might have some gas
in back.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.564
Don't tell me you have gas...

07:05.880 --> 07:07.370
Look, I have a little.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.404
One liter is enough,
just to make it to the gas station.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.603
You're saving my life again.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.848
- Again.
- Thanks, honey.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.168
No problem.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.964
Sorry, I didn't introduce you.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.284
Fernando, Gloria.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.766
Gloria, Fernando.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.886
- Your friend from Madrid?
- My friend from Madrid.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.526
Miguel Angel invited me
to spend my vacation here.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.166
It's not a vacation,
don't listen to him.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.600
He's here to shoot a documentary.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.847
Well, with my camera...

07:35.720 --> 07:36.926
About Joan, his gardener.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.088
Mom, he's leaving!

07:39.360 --> 07:39.610
Olivia, I'm ready.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.170
- Shit.
- Damn.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.964
They're leaving.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.764
I'll take her to the airport.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.042
<i>-I'll</i> see you guys around.
<i>-l'll</i> call you.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.004
- See you later.
- Nice to meet you.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.201
Bye!

07:55.040 --> 07:56.610
Who is she?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.131
Nuria, the sculptor.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.765
- The sculptor?
- Yeah.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.325
I don't know why,
I thought she was fat.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.488
Who said she was fat?
She's hot.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.205
- Very hot.
- Yeah.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.243
Everybody here on the island
knows her but...

08:07.440 --> 08:09.488
Yeah? She's been around?

08:09.680 --> 08:11.808
No, not around...

08:12.000 --> 08:15.004
She's moved around.
She worked in Paris, New York...

08:15.200 --> 08:18.283
She's worth the trouble.
We'll have dinner with her.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.051
What has she got there?
A heart?

08:21.240 --> 08:23.720
I don't know?
Stuff she makes.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.127
She does her own thing.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.210
But I'll invite her to dinner
and you can get to know her.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.528
She's worth it, you'll see.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.926
What's the problem?

08:37.120 --> 08:40.010
There aren't any more
flights south.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.530
Let's go home.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.291
But please tell him
to come with us.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.691
He won't listen. He's talking
to his family in German.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.245
Tim!

08:58.320 --> 08:59.446
- Let's go.
- No...

08:59.640 --> 09:01.244
- No, let's go.
- We have to follow him.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.841
We're not going
to follow him, Olivia.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.565
You two have been at it
all afternoon...

09:05.760 --> 09:07.683
He doesn't speak Catalonian
or Spanish.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.767
He'll get by.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.966
So how are you?

09:15.160 --> 09:18.130
Fine, fine.
Actually I feel great.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.845
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.326
And the divorce?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.967
Fine, fine.
Very civilized, very normal.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.730
The worst pan was the move.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.762
The move, right.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.885
They say moving is the third
leading cause of depression.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.289
And divorce is number two,
so you can imagine...

09:35.480 --> 09:36.367
And the first?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.245
The death of a loved one,
of course.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.050
Sorry. I didn't mean
to bring that up.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.007
I've gotten over Mercedes.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.361
Right.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.006
- Hey, this island is paradise.
- Yeah, it sure is.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.441
You live like a god here.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.802
Not a care in the world...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.526
Well, actually, I am worried
about something right now.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.881
Yeah? What?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.962
I have to give a speech
before the queen.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.366
Before the queen?

10:03.560 --> 10:07.167
You're putting me on.
I thought we supported the Republic.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.727
We do,
but it's the queen.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.160
Right.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.409
- You always mix everything up.
- Go ahead.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.129
- Look, you know what?
- What?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.688
Relax, enjoy and remember
you're starting a new life.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.089
Yeah. And you know what
I want to do with it?

10:25.280 --> 10:26.042
What?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.925
Hear your speech
before the queen.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.924
What a bastard.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.681
Hey, is that Joan?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.689
Yeah. If he's here
at this hour.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.481
- Hold on, I'm going to film him.
- Now?

10:45.680 --> 10:48.206
Yeah, without him knowing.
It comes out much better.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.528
Okay, I'll bring in your suitcase.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.120
What heat!

11:11.320 --> 11:13.288
- Whose suitcase is that?
- Fer's.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.568
What is Fer doing here?
And what's he doing?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.401
The documentary, sweetie.
I told you he was coming.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.522
Chubby, you did not tell me
he was coming.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.606
I told you he was coming.
Later on I said he wasn't, but...

11:27.080 --> 11:30.004
No, look. You said he was
and then you said he wasn't...

11:30.320 --> 11:31.367
- And then I said he was.
- No.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.688
No, you didn't.
My mother's coming.

11:33.880 --> 11:34.961
- Your mother?
- Yes.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.322
I told you my mother
was coming.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.170
And then you said she wasn't.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.124
No, I said my mother
was coming,

11:41.320 --> 11:42.845
then that she wasn't
because of my sister,

11:43.040 --> 11:44.883
but then at lunch I said
she was coming.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.286
She's bringing all the kids.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.369
- What kids?
- All of them.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.210
How are you, sir?

11:54.680 --> 11:55.761
Hi. We're here.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.405
What do you say?

11:57.600 --> 11:58.886
To make the documentary.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.286
That's great.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.324
Olivia, please.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.289
What?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.084
Are you going to sit there
all day like that?

12:09.280 --> 12:11.567
- Like what?
- Like that.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.842
- Thinking about it.
- Yes.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.122
Why don't you take Max
for a walk?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.411
I don't feel like it.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.242
You're going to keep
thinking about it?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.369
Yes, I'm going to keep
thinking about it.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.281
Can't you ever give me
a little support?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.284
- I am, Olivia.
- No.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.484
Otherwise I'd say,
"Yeah, go after him."

12:36.360 --> 12:38.089
What for? He's angry,
leave him alone.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.648
Right now he's hurting,
or he's hurting himself...

12:42.120 --> 12:43.360
But it's not fair.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.724
He's hurting because of some
fairy tale he's heard about

12:47.920 --> 12:51.003
relationships having to be
like this, but it's absurd.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.209
We're in a long distance
relationship,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.402
we haven't seen each other
in 5 months.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.605
I assumed he had been
with other people.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.327
And I love him so much
that I don't care.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.204
He can love anybody he wants.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.847
Yeah, but what he feels isn't
the same as what you feel.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.727
If he's hurting, you'll probably

13:12.920 --> 13:15.730
have to try to accept it
and understand him.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.005
Because that's something

13:18.200 --> 13:20.123
he can't control.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.129
You saw how he jumped
out of the car.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.641
He lacks even more family
structure than I do practically.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.281
Olivia, you don't lack
family structure.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.846
I don't?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.081
No, you have a family.
The one you were dealt.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.930
And that's no reason to...

13:38.400 --> 13:40.243
I have never had

13:40.440 --> 13:42.807
a relationship around me
that worked.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.321
Olivia, nobody has a relationship
that works.

13:47.200 --> 13:47.928
That's my point.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.566
It may look like it
on the outside...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.923
but when you look inside,

13:53.120 --> 13:55.851
a perfect happy life?
Nobody has that.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.486
There are happier times
and less happy times.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.610
That's exactly what I'm saying.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.169
You need to be okay with yourself,
not have a perfect relationship.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.362
If you're okay,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.366
your relationship will be too.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.404
But you can't expect
the other person to make you happy.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.366
Tim can't expect his relationship
with you to make him happy.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.800
He's affected but...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.082
Mom, I agree with you on this.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.327
Okay.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.723
Don't say I don't give you
support.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.251
I support you in everything.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.851
Hold on a second.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.802
Miguel Angel.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.971
Hi, sweetie.
Look, I have a question.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.886
Have you rented your house?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.366
No, Olivia's here.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.131
Would you mind if l borrowed it
for a few days?

14:41.320 --> 14:42.845
Okay, you can have it.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.921
What's wrong?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.568
I'll tell you later.
Just a little mess, nothing serious.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.603
It's not for me,
it's for Fernando.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.121
In any case,
I'll tell you about it later.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.449
Too many people around.
Okay?

14:56.640 --> 14:57.766
Okay, tell me later.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.882
Thanks, you're a doll.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.286
Kiss.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.847
Bye.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.606
Miguel Angel.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.041
- What about him?
- I don't know, I don't get it.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.004
Hold up the microphone.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.168
A little lower, there.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.283
Wait one second,
sorry to interrupt.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.403
Nuria just called.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.568
She says we can go and see
her studio.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.491
- Nuria the sculptor?
- Yeah, the one from the car.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.284
Okay, then hold on.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.609
Joan, do you mind
if we continue tomorrow?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.006
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.921
If my wife lets me.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.045
So things are good with Silvia?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.323
With Silvia? Great.
She's an amazing woman.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.205
The problem is...

15:46.400 --> 15:47.925
She says she loves me,

15:48.120 --> 15:50.851
I think she's confusing love
with a charity.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.804
Jesus, man. You think that...?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.243
You have a wonderful wife,
she's young, beautiful...

15:56.440 --> 15:59.330
And she even came here
to take care of you.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.363
And commits suicide after?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.562
Don't even joke like that.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.683
I'm sorry, but...

16:06.040 --> 16:07.769
- What?
- It makes no sense, damn it.

16:07.960 --> 16:11.760
The best marketing mind
I've ever met planting tomatoes.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.043
She should be in Cannes
winning festivals.

16:15.240 --> 16:15.923
Yeah.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.168
- Is this it?
- Here we are.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.569
We're here. Wait until you see it,
it's incredible.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.331
- Great. It's all this?
- Yeah, all of it.

16:27.560 --> 16:31.690
From down there
to the end of the wall.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.882
- Wow.
-lt's amazing, you'll see.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.566
Let's see.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.403
Open the convent!
Nuria!

16:38.600 --> 16:39.840
"Marine Arse."

16:40.040 --> 16:41.610
"Arsenal."
Some prankster...

16:41.800 --> 16:44.007
- Hi.
- How's it going?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.770
- How's it going?
- Fine, fine.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.964
- Thanks for inviting us.
- This place is beautiful.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.845
-It's great...
- All of this.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.168
The inside is amazing.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.761
- Something to drink?
- I could use a glass of water.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.567
My mouth is dry.
I'll get it myself.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.330
This place was an arsenal?

17:03.560 --> 17:05.050
It was an arsenal.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.723
It was a very closed space

17:07.960 --> 17:11.042
and we remodeled,
added some windows...

17:11.240 --> 17:12.890
and now it's a workshop.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.367
- A splendid workshop.
- Cool, huh?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.643
-It's a great place to work.
- I see you paint as well.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.605
I do some painting
before I do sculptures.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.529
- Fernando paints too.
- Sketches.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.769
Well, I paint on Sundays.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.770
He's great. The one at my house
with the big leaves...

17:29.960 --> 17:32.327
Very pretty.
That's a very nice painting.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.486
- Give me one of yours.
- I already did.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.728
This is an engraving press.
You do engravings?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.890
- Yes, we do, with a friend.
- That's great.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.726
- Experimenting a little.
- Neat stuff.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.447
You have this here.
Great.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.810
<i>-L'll</i> tell you about the house later.
- What's going on?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.890
Silvia filled the house
with nephews again.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.162
- Is this copper?
- Yes.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.363
And what do you do?
Weave it?

17:58.560 --> 18:01.962
It's a fantastic material,
it really is.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.401
It's very pliable,
it never rusts...

18:04.600 --> 18:06.728
- I love it.
-l'm making...

18:06.920 --> 18:09.526
The color and that gloss
it has when...

18:09.720 --> 18:12.485
Look, it's different.
It's very pretty.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.364
Each one has its own character.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.562
It's great to work with.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.762
I'm mostly testing things
right now.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.122
-I'm getting an idea.
- What?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.402
Including Nuria in the documentary.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.250
- Do it.
- The one about Menorca?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.966
The one I told you about,
the history of the island.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.447
- Great idea.
- To give it balance.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.122
- I like it.
- The feminine side and all that.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.971
-I've never done it before.
- You don't have to do anything.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.561
I'm just going to film you.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.483
While you work,
while you do your thing...

18:43.680 --> 18:44.920
I can try it.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.691
-I'm sure it will be great.
- Very nice.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.689
- You had a good idea.
- Yes.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.891
And the house is free.
You can stay there if you want.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.684
- The house?
- Yeah.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.689
- The big house?
- Great idea.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.406
So you can work, right?
It's easier.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.601
I'm sorry, but...

19:00.800 --> 19:03.201
- Olivia, where are you going?
- To Mahon.

19:03.400 --> 19:03.889
Hi.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.203
Hi.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.164
Fernando will be staying
a few days.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.600
We'll be filming.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.040
I'm going to look for Tim.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.924
- We'll talk later.
- Bye.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.522
I've got your suitcase,
we can get it right now.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.881
What's the point of waiting?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.525
- Right now?
- Right now.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.051
Come on, let's go.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.651
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.088
- Great, huh?
- Fantastic.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.045
You sure I'm not bothering her?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.811
- Not at all. She invited you.
- That's true.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.322
Look, Fernando.
She's delighted. I know her.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.000
She's just a little withdrawn.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.043
Go ahead, grab it.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.851
What was I going to say?
Do you know if she has a boyfriend?

19:44.040 --> 19:46.646
No, never. Well, she was married,
but a long time ago.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.889
Eh, buddy?

19:49.080 --> 19:51.367
-I'm off, Silvia's waiting.
- Okay.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.688
Thanks a lot. Bye.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.167
Bye.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.081
Hi.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.367
What's wrong?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.362
He freaked out. A lot.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.369
What do you mean?
What happened?

20:37.560 --> 20:41.246
Tim got very upset
and he took off.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.171
Normal. What do you want
me to do, Olivia?

20:44.360 --> 20:45.691
Help me.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.006
- Help you?
- Please.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.488
We were together and now
you want me to help you find Tim?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.330
-It doesn't make any sense.
- Why not?

20:52.920 --> 20:56.163
Because it doesn't.
I don't want to help you.

20:56.360 --> 20:56.929
Please.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.202
I'm asking you please.
As a friend.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.209
As a friend?
We're friends now?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.084
- Yes.
- We're friends now.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.880
Yes, please.
Come on, Lluis.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.447
Damn.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.284
"Please, please."

21:09.480 --> 21:11.448
- You always get what you want.
- That's right.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.165
-"That's right."
- Come on.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.488
Bye.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.603
- He's probably getting drunk.
- Should we check this one?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.607
Yes, we came one day.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.931
Excuse me.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.329
Have you seen a tall Swiss kid
with blue eyes?

21:52.040 --> 21:53.724
No? Okay.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.771
That way?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.849
I think he might be
at the other place.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.288
Let's go home now, please.
That's it.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.204
- No.
- Yes. Please.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.691
Are you stupid or what?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.286
No!

22:46.800 --> 22:46.959
Fernando, what commercials
have you done?

22:46.960 --> 22:49.884
Fernando, what commercials
have you done?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.527
I've done a lot, actually.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.724
Less lately, because of
the crisis and all...

22:56.200 --> 22:59.568
I did the one with Rafil,
for lmagenio...

23:00.080 --> 23:02.242
Several for Nintendo...

23:02.800 --> 23:03.881
Laiker non-alcoholic beer,

23:04.080 --> 23:05.525
with the little boy playing soccer...

23:05.720 --> 23:08.326
- Remember it?
- I don't have a TV.

23:09.040 --> 23:09.848
Okay.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.681
I haven't seen any commercials.
But they're very nice.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.487
Yeah, I think they're son of
present day an.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.125
Right now,

23:19.320 --> 23:22.130
just like in the Renaissance
when Leonardo and Michelangelo

23:22.320 --> 23:25.961
had to work for popes
and patrons like the Medicis,

23:26.160 --> 23:30.051
now we have to work for
the big name brands

23:30.960 --> 23:33.042
and making commercials
is a way to express yourself.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.971
So that means any profession
is an an.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.605
Like someone making bread,

23:37.800 --> 23:41.043
hired by someone else,
that would be an too, right?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.328
But we're selling a message.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.081
Commercials reach a lot of people.
It's a responsibility we have.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.090
Yes, but what is the point
of making commercials?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.484
Well, obviously the point
is commercial.

23:53.680 --> 23:58.720
That doesn't mean
it's not artistic.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.049
I think, just like the Renaissance
had patrons,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.288
we have our patrons too.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.563
So the large companies
are modern day patrons?

24:07.760 --> 24:08.886
Sure. Yeah.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.208
I love doing
commissioned work too.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.607
But the intention behind
what I do

24:13.800 --> 24:16.849
has nothing to do with
that of a publicist

24:17.040 --> 24:18.849
-or a creative director.
- Why?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.041
Well, first of all,

24:20.240 --> 24:23.483
they have access to means
and a budget

24:23.680 --> 24:26.843
available to only 3 or 4 artists
in the an world.

24:27.040 --> 24:27.689
Yes.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.125
And also the intention behind

24:32.320 --> 24:35.403
a commercial is not the same

24:35.600 --> 24:39.127
as the one behind...
why you do an.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.563
But let's say you somehow...

24:42.760 --> 24:45.206
What do you mean
when you say intention?

24:45.760 --> 24:47.967
- Well, for me commercials...
- The message?

24:48.680 --> 24:50.250
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hello.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.169
- Hi.
- How did it go?

24:52.880 --> 24:54.325
Has Tim called?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.526
No, nobody has called.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.088
- Have you seen him?
- No.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.727
He hasn't called you?

25:05.120 --> 25:09.284
Olivia, have you moved your stuff
to make space for Fernando?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.411
My Stuff?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.245
From where?

25:13.440 --> 25:15.886
From the bedroom. Fernando...
Remember?

25:16.080 --> 25:17.081
He's staying a few days.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.930
It doesn't have to be...

25:19.280 --> 25:22.170
No, she can move a few things.
Do you need a hand?

25:22.360 --> 25:23.850
No, that's okay.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.405
- I can do it.
- Yeah?

25:26.800 --> 25:27.881
Thank you.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.364
Okay, so let's say,
when you think of a work,

25:33.560 --> 25:36.211
you don't have a message
to relay?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.289
A message?
I don't know if it's a message.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.089
- I try to say something.
- Sure.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.167
But something

25:43.120 --> 25:45.043
I think can be useful

25:45.240 --> 25:47.811
with an intention.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.002
I don't create a work of an
to sell it.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.691
What does that mean?

25:51.920 --> 25:53.968
That my goal isn't

25:55.880 --> 25:58.690
to sell the work.
I follow my process

25:58.880 --> 26:00.689
while I'm making it

26:00.920 --> 26:04.049
and then something comes out
which later maybe I can sell,

26:04.240 --> 26:06.163
which is of interest.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.840
- In the end you have to try...
- Sure.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.128
But to a certain extent,

26:12.320 --> 26:14.687
you manage to live off your an.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.450
Purely off your an.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.371
- I barely make a living.
- Yeah?

26:19.560 --> 26:21.801
Well, I do other things,

26:22.000 --> 26:23.490
but when I'm trying to do...

26:23.680 --> 26:25.682
For example, the exhibition
I'm doing in Palma,

26:25.880 --> 26:28.690
I try to set a path, a guide,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.565
and not do material work,

26:31.760 --> 26:34.240
but I try to create a discourse

26:34.440 --> 26:36.568
-on what I want to say.
- Right.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.208
You see?
You have a message.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.521
What do you mean by discourse?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.124
-I'm leaving...
- Need a hand with this?

26:45.360 --> 26:48.045
Can we finish the conversation...

26:48.240 --> 26:50.004
-another time?
- Sure, fine.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.891
- We'll continue talking tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.003
<i>-L'll</i> help you with your things.
- Okay.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.168
Good night, Fernando.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.330
If you need to, you can shut
the door and come back.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.286
<i>-L'll</i> clean up, don't worry.
- See you tomorrow.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.528
See you tomorrow.
Get some rest.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.330
- Good night.
- Bye.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.043
- Is the water clean?
- Yes.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.687
- Catch anything?
- Hi.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.486
I've got an octopus.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.685
- An octopus?
- Yes.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.726
You have to reel them in slowly,
like women.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.086
Otherwise,

29:08.280 --> 29:10.681
you'll never get
your hands on one.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.124
"Your Majesty
and dear friends of the island:

29:15.320 --> 29:18.881
I'd like to start by saying that
I'm proud to be representing..."

29:19.920 --> 29:22.491
Please stop running!

29:22.800 --> 29:24.768
Okay, Martin!

29:25.040 --> 29:26.883
Martin! Carlos! Be careful.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.845
Be careful!

29:30.400 --> 29:32.971
Hey! Over there!

29:33.160 --> 29:36.084
No splashing!
I said no! That's enough!

29:38.560 --> 29:39.721
Damn it!

29:40.680 --> 29:43.445
Look! We have a plague
of Argentinian ants.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.849
- If it were only the ants...
- What's wrong?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.846
You don't hear it?
I can't get any work done.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.601
How can I concentrate with all
these screaming kids around?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.246
-It's impossible.
- She's my mother.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.609
She's my mother, Miguel Angel.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.043
Wait, if she hears me
she'll get upset and leave.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.890
I haven't seen her in 6 months

30:04.080 --> 30:06.845
and she brought the kids,
which you know makes me happy.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.442
We're cut off from the world here.
It's going to drive me crazy.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.849
Look, this isn't working, Silvia.
Really.

30:14.040 --> 30:14.882
What?

30:15.080 --> 30:19.005
I came here for peace and quiet
and to forget the world...

30:19.200 --> 30:21.328
Sweetie, please, relax.
Please, relax.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.726
Listen to me.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.401
It's the speech.
This always happens to you.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.560
You're a man who...

30:28.880 --> 30:31.611
who gives great speeches.
A natural speech-giver.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.406
So relax, cheer up.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.762
My mom's here,
enjoy the kids...

30:36.960 --> 30:38.530
Open up, sweetheart.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.084
If my mother weren't here I'd...

30:41.280 --> 30:42.805
You are so full of it.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.529
I'll hold this for you.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.641
Okay.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.049
Where do you want me to stand?

30:50.240 --> 30:53.084
Right here, a little further away.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.202
Here?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.850
Yeah, right there is fine.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.726
Let's see.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.041
Yes. A little more...

31:03.240 --> 31:04.969
- Here?
- There.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.810
- When I give the word.
- Okay.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.685
Ready...

31:09.040 --> 31:09.927
Action!

31:10.120 --> 31:13.010
We're in Mongofre next to
the Aguja de Mongofre,

31:13.200 --> 31:15.123
which we built in 2012,

31:15.320 --> 31:17.766
the first piece
in the Latitud 40 project.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.884
The 40th parallel passes
right across this spot

31:21.080 --> 31:23.481
and we threaded the parallel
with this needle.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.763
It's the beginning of a project
designed to unite

31:26.960 --> 31:28.928
different places
with different pieces of an

31:29.120 --> 31:31.327
passing along the 40th parallel
with the intent

31:31.520 --> 31:36.242
of reestablishing peace and order
among cultures and civilizations.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.325
We'll be doing another piece

31:38.520 --> 31:42.241
in the Tajo River, then we're going
to Portugal, then to...

31:42.960 --> 31:47.488
New Jersey, California,
Japan, Beijing, Turkmenistan,

31:47.680 --> 31:49.444
Ankara, Mount Olympus...

31:50.040 --> 31:53.487
Would you mind if we stopped
for a second?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.007
They're coming in...

31:55.320 --> 31:56.526
What is it?

31:56.720 --> 31:59.166
I was meeting people.
They're early, but...

31:59.360 --> 32:02.091
We're doing a piece
with flags on the beach.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.328
- Yeah?
- We do it from time to time.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.603
They're silent actions.
We set it up and take it down.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.211
Can I film it?

32:09.520 --> 32:10.487
Yes, if you want.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.127
We'll stop and I'll help you.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.288
This piece is in memory

32:40.480 --> 32:44.121
of the actions we took
in Menorca in 2005 against

32:44.320 --> 32:45.731
the Iraq War.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.890
We tried to send a message
of peace to the...

32:49.720 --> 32:50.846
My cell phone is ringing.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.651
- Hold on a second.
- Answer it.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.007
Piedad?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.331
Tomorrow?

32:59.840 --> 33:02.764
I won't be able to go.
Why tomorrow?

33:03.320 --> 33:04.446
Really?

33:05.600 --> 33:08.206
Okay, okay. I'll try.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.449
I'll tell you later,
I'll call you in a little while.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.168
Okay, me too.
Big kiss. Bye.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.687
Do you have to go?

33:17.880 --> 33:20.486
I think so. But I'll be back
in a couple of days.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.326
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.649
I got a project in Madrid
I was waiting for.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.042
Okay, that's how it goes.

33:29.400 --> 33:33.769
Mom, I don't get why you have
to go to Madrid, now of all times.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.450
- Piedad called me.
- It sucks.

33:35.640 --> 33:36.880
It's a one-day trip.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.243
Piedad calls and you go.
I ask you to stay and you don't.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.330
Olivia, it's two days.
I'm coming right back.

33:43.520 --> 33:47.650
-I'm fragile right now.
- Fernando will look after you.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.569
Sure.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.161
Yeah. Remember to feed Max.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.840
- And water the garden.
- I always feed him.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.446
Don't worry,
everything will be fine.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.644
I'm sorry about what you
went through, but I can't fix it.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.922
- You're sorry?
- Yes, but...

34:06.120 --> 34:08.521
You can't fix it,
but you could be here with me.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.610
My being here doesn't matter.
And I have a job.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.485
I can't just give up everything
and stay here with you.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.331
What a great mom.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.569
Then you complain when
I talk about you in therapy.

34:20.920 --> 34:25.050
If I stayed, you'd talk about me
in therapy anyway.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.483
- There must be a reason I do it.
- Okay.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.362
We're born free because
we're free by nature,

34:50.560 --> 34:54.610
but it's true you're born
into certain circumstances

34:54.800 --> 34:58.725
and barriers, but as long as
you can decide, you're free.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.287
Yeah, but you have to face
whatever reality...

35:12.040 --> 35:12.802
Popcorn!

35:13.200 --> 35:14.406
Please, no hard drugs!

35:16.160 --> 35:16.968
Good one!

35:17.160 --> 35:19.049
- You guys from here?
- From San Climent.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.446
- Where?
- San Climent.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.130
Next to the airport.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.446
Okay, okay.

35:23.640 --> 35:24.687
How is life here?

35:24.880 --> 35:26.882
Quiet.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.924
- Where are you from?
- Madrid. Well, Navalcarnero.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.282
- Where?
- Navalcarnero.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.726
Where is that?

35:34.160 --> 35:36.162
Madrid is about 30 kilometers
from Navalcarnero.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.521
North or south?

35:37.720 --> 35:41.770
More like on one side,
to the west.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.651
Yeah, but freedom doesn't mean
"Do whatever you want."

35:44.840 --> 35:48.970
It means "Decide within the limits
you have to decide from."

35:49.160 --> 35:50.047
- In your opinion.
- Yeah.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.242
And now I've decided
we're going to dance.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.443
- Who wants to dance?
- Not me.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.085
- Not me.
- But...

36:00.280 --> 36:01.167
Come on, Charlie.

36:01.800 --> 36:02.608
I will.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.449
You?

36:03.640 --> 36:04.323
Yeah.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.328
- Fine.
- You mind?

36:05.520 --> 36:07.488
No. Come on, let's go.

36:08.080 --> 36:08.763
Go on.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.486
Are you okay?

36:36.680 --> 36:38.603
- The popcorn!
- What's wrong?

36:38.800 --> 36:41.087
- You want to drink something?
- Yes!

36:49.800 --> 36:51.040
Hi!

36:51.280 --> 36:52.247
Mom?

36:53.840 --> 36:57.890
Yeah, he's with me, he's fine.
Why?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.811
Hello?

37:02.160 --> 37:04.766
Yes, yes.
No, it's the neighbors.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.526
Yeah, they're having a huge bash
next door.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.724
Yeah, we told them, but nothing.
There's no way.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.367
What?

37:13.640 --> 37:15.324
You're staying longer?

37:15.520 --> 37:17.329
Okay, don't worry.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.127
Olivia will show me
all of your sculptures

37:21.320 --> 37:23.004
on the whole island.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.887
Okay. Thanks.
Big kiss. Bye.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.766
You've got some nerve!

37:30.960 --> 37:31.529
Come on.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.449
It's the least you can do.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.163
"Good luck."

37:42.360 --> 37:44.089
Sure, it's made horse shoes.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.528
I'm getting some great shots.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.569
-It's really cool.
- Yeah.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.884
It's great up here.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.884
This is called
"The Giant's View."

38:06.080 --> 38:09.482
It's free and transparent.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.167
It's in Santa Agueda square.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.887
Oli.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.851
I forgot to do the thing
with the drum.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.885
Hide.

38:32.920 --> 38:33.682
Action.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.491
Okay, perfect.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.647
Here?

39:06.640 --> 39:08.244
Come on, Fer!

39:09.560 --> 39:10.368
Jump in.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.885
Bend your knees a bit.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.365
- Like this?
- Like that.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.607
That's it!

39:19.160 --> 39:21.811
Very good!
Feeling and agility.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.929
How do you get along
with your mother?

39:28.160 --> 39:29.764
I treat her like shit
sometimes.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.851
- You do?
- Yes.

39:32.120 --> 39:37.604
She's the person I use
my bad temper on the most.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.248
But I always end up
listening to her because

39:40.960 --> 39:43.566
she's always right,
even if it bugs me.

39:43.760 --> 39:46.331
I don't know why,
a lot of things bug me.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.568
That's the thing about mothers,

39:48.760 --> 39:50.410
- I guess.
- Yeah.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.250
Although my mom...

39:52.840 --> 39:54.444
I don't know,
she's an example for me.

39:54.640 --> 39:58.440
Whenever I feel bad,
if I don't know where I am,

39:58.640 --> 39:59.687
if I'm lost.

39:59.880 --> 40:03.248
She says to create something,
to draw, to paint, anything,

40:03.440 --> 40:04.362
like...

40:04.840 --> 40:07.684
She associates an
very closely with healing.

40:07.880 --> 40:11.521
That's worked for me
and I think it has for her.

40:11.800 --> 40:16.488
And if you see my mother's work,
you're seeing her.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.091
Yeah, actually...

40:18.280 --> 40:21.887
there are a lot of figures
of women with roots in the earth.

40:22.080 --> 40:22.763
Holding up the world.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.281
Women embracing the world, yeah.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.482
Yeah.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.725
The world backwards.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.285
The world backwards,

40:30.480 --> 40:31.720
the ties that bond...

40:31.920 --> 40:34.491
They're broken, tied again...

40:34.800 --> 40:39.442
She's got clear ideas,
even if she changes her idea and...

40:39.800 --> 40:41.609
and has clear ideas again

40:41.800 --> 40:45.441
and changes her mind again
and has clear ideas again.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.285
- She's a roller coaster.
- Right.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.726
How does she handle
you seeing boys...

40:53.920 --> 40:56.491
- With boys?
- With this Tim, for example.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.840
Well, she says that as long as
I feel good about myself,

41:01.040 --> 41:03.088
-to go ahead.
- Okay.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.445
But anyway.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.324
I'm confused right now.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.569
But you're confused...?

41:10.760 --> 41:13.525
It's normal at your age
to have arguments.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.883
I don't know what
a normal relationship is like.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.484
I know I love Tim.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.844
The problem is...

41:23.680 --> 41:25.409
there's someone else too.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.726
Another boy?

41:27.080 --> 41:31.085
Yes. And I love them both,
but in different ways.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.365
One gives me one thing,
the other gives me another.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.531
I don't know.
I'm a little confused.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.611
I don't think relationships
nowadays work anyway...

41:43.120 --> 41:44.326
Did yours work?

41:44.520 --> 41:47.251
Mine worked while it worked.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.771
Many have worked.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.371
Not so great, huh?

41:50.720 --> 41:52.484
I've been married 3 times.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.567
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.451
And not anymore?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.051
No, I'm divorced now.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.045
- For the third time.
- For the third time, yeah.

42:00.240 --> 42:04.529
The first was what we might call
a conventional marriage,

42:04.720 --> 42:08.930
we had mutual friends,
we got along fine more or less,

42:10.280 --> 42:13.090
but we ended up fighting

42:13.920 --> 42:16.002
and things ended badly.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.926
Fernando, we're going home.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.851
One second, honey.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.530
Fernando, I am leaving.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.848
It's early, sweetcakes.
Wait a bit.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.567
For the last time,
are you coming or not?

42:26.880 --> 42:27.608
Goal!

42:27.960 --> 42:29.564
Pilar, wait, I'm coming with you.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.128
Do some breathing
and give it a rest, sweetcakes!

42:33.320 --> 42:35.891
- Are you stupid?
- I am for marrying you.

42:36.080 --> 42:36.842
Chump!

42:38.880 --> 42:41.042
And your second marriage?

42:41.960 --> 42:45.328
My second marriage was actually
a pretty serious relationship.

42:45.680 --> 42:49.207
She was quite a bit
younger than me.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.688
I was in my late forties,
she was in her early twenties...

42:53.640 --> 42:56.450
and things were great at first,
but...

42:57.240 --> 42:59.163
but we reached a point where

42:59.560 --> 43:01.961
I think you could notice
the age difference.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.640
She wanted kids,
I wasn't sure about it...

43:04.840 --> 43:08.083
That could be the difference
in age or in priorities.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.169
Yeah, maybe.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.651
But it ended between us
and not very well.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.801
You're a selfish son of a bitch!

43:17.120 --> 43:18.610
The perfect excuse, right?

43:18.800 --> 43:20.564
Poor Beatrice
has to put up with me.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.922
Poor Beatrice,
but she can fuck off.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.248
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.408
What does age matter?

43:27.600 --> 43:28.567
Even you've said it...

43:28.760 --> 43:31.206
If you really loved me,
you wouldn't think such nonsense.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.051
You just showed how twisted
you can be.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.926
I've given you everything
and I've never asked for anything,

43:38.120 --> 43:40.600
-not even a son.
- Excuse me, a son...

43:40.800 --> 43:44.168
I never complained about your
hang-ups, your eternal silences...

43:44.480 --> 43:45.891
Really...

43:46.440 --> 43:49.603
All I ask in return is for you
to love me back.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.168
But I see you have no desire
to fight for me.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.124
You've made that very clear.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.404
And then came the third.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.170
Yeah, the third.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.723
Well, the third was
a girl my age

44:03.200 --> 44:05.601
and we met in French class.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.445
Is something wrong?

44:26.720 --> 44:29.041
Paris must be so beautiful.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.521
Actually I don't think
we were great friends,

44:31.720 --> 44:34.849
but we ended up finding out
that we weren't in love.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.083
- So...
- Buddy.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.084
No point either, right?

44:39.280 --> 44:42.250
But it's important to end
a relationship well.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.807
Yeah, I think it's crucial.

44:45.040 --> 44:49.011
Because it's someone
who you've lived with...

44:49.920 --> 44:51.809
for years.

44:52.200 --> 44:55.044
Otherwise it's like
you wasted your time.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.529
Exactly. I think you learn
something from each woman.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.166
Every woman is a world
of her own,

45:02.360 --> 45:05.921
and I really like discovering
other worlds.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.566
- And women, right?
- And women.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.009
That's a good thing.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.846
We're here.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.280
- This is it?
- Yes.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.289
-It's a cave.
- You'll see.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.326
It's one of the most spectacular
places on the island.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.611
You're going to love it.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.085
What vertigo.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.202
I think people who have vertigo

46:16.680 --> 46:20.605
are afraid they can't control
their impulses.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.643
Well, hey. I'm leaving.

46:36.440 --> 46:37.646
Who's the baby?

46:38.840 --> 46:40.569
- That's my mother.
- Your mother?

46:40.760 --> 46:41.921
Yeah.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.009
But the baby's blond.

46:44.200 --> 46:45.929
She's got earrings.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.451
And that little boy?

46:47.800 --> 46:50.041
We don't have any boys
in my family.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.446
- No?
- All girls.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.608
- Yeah?
- That's Ana...

46:53.800 --> 46:55.211
Oh, that's Ana.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.164
- Marta...
- And Marta...

46:58.880 --> 47:00.928
How many sisters
has she got?

47:01.280 --> 47:03.487
- Six.
- Six.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.731
All women.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.570
What year is this from?

47:10.200 --> 47:11.884
From '68.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.606
The month of May, am I right?

47:17.920 --> 47:20.844
"Your Majesty and dear friends
of the island:

47:21.240 --> 47:24.323
I'd like to start by saying that
I'm proud to be representing

47:24.520 --> 47:26.841
a profession I love so much
at this forum."

47:27.040 --> 47:30.169
- Not so fast. Slow down.
- Okay.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.042
"Menorca is not an island,

47:34.240 --> 47:37.323
it's a legend anchored somewhere
in the Mediterranean.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.205
It might not even exist.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.410
Because such beauty
seems more like fantasy,

47:43.600 --> 47:45.364
a dream, than reality.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.848
The talaiots, the coves,
the north wind,

47:49.040 --> 47:50.724
the crystal-clear water...

47:51.200 --> 47:53.328
Who in their right mind
would ever believe

47:53.520 --> 47:55.727
-that all of this is real?"
- Sixto.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.127
- Sixto?
- Sixto. He's over there.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.522
On, m!

47:59.720 --> 48:01.484
- Hi!
- Look at them.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.891
- I don't feel like seeing him.
- Why? He's a nice guy.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.890
But he hasn't given me any work
at the agency since you left.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.481
Okay, then. This is the best time
to fix it.

48:11.760 --> 48:12.761
Let's go and see him.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.247
- You have to come.
- Sixto, stop, please.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.885
What's up, guys?

48:17.480 --> 48:19.642
- How's it going?
- What a surprise.

48:20.120 --> 48:22.122
- Miguel Angel.
- Sixto, how are you?

48:22.320 --> 48:24.004
- Great.
- Alicia.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.931
Alicia, this is...

48:27.120 --> 48:29.088
-"Say goodbye to coffee stains."
- Fernando.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.248
That's right, sorry.
Anyway, I was saying...

48:31.440 --> 48:33.886
You just caught me red-handed.

48:34.080 --> 48:37.084
I was trying to convince Silvia
to come to the agency.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.851
Well...

48:39.040 --> 48:41.088
You need it,
you have less superstars.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.965
But we have more clients,
and they're more satisfied.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.323
But seriously, it would be
wasting a huge talent.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.490
I agree, she should be in Madrid
making it big, but...

48:50.760 --> 48:53.684
- Exactly.
- Okay, I'm getting dizzy.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.929
- We'll see if goes for it.
- We'll see.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.044
Like I said, Alicia and I
are here on the boat.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.049
Come by and have a drink.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.322
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.841
- We're at the port in Mahon.
- See you there.

49:06.040 --> 49:08.122
-Okay, then. Great.
- Bye.

49:08.520 --> 49:11.126
- Think it over.
- Bye, Sixto.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.042
"Say goodbye to coffee stains?"

49:15.440 --> 49:17.522
When can I say goodbye
to this torture?

49:17.720 --> 49:19.961
- He's kidding.
- He does the same thing every time.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.128
-It's his sense of humor.
- And that slogan wasn't mine.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.322
-It's not like you.
- Of course not.

49:24.520 --> 49:29.401
And it's not like you
to talk to Sixto about my work.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.887
-"It's about time..."
- What's wrong with you two today?

49:32.080 --> 49:34.321
I don't know.
But it's not like you.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.490
Jesus, what a day.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.011
Do I have to go to his boat?

49:38.200 --> 49:41.044
Of course you do. You just said
he doesn't give you work.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.481
Now we have a chance
to spend time with him.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.842
- You have to go to his boat.
- Okay.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.410
Look, there they are.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.848
- How are you guys?
- Great.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.846
- How are you?
- Fine.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.566
Come in, Silvia, hi.

49:59.760 --> 50:03.082
Miguel Angel, welcome to
my humble Queen of Africa.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.604
Fernando, wait.

50:05.800 --> 50:08.041
- Can you help me cast off?
- Sure.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.488
Okay, hold on.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.006
This one?

50:12.200 --> 50:15.443
Wait until I loosen over here
or you won't be able to.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.850
- Now let it go. All right?
- Yeah.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.610
Great. Perfect. Drop it.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.326
Now get on! Get on!
We'll leave you behind!

50:24.520 --> 50:26.488
Get on, man.
You'll be left behind.

50:27.240 --> 50:30.926
Come on. That's it.
Great.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.125
Are you going to pout
the whole weekend?

51:22.640 --> 51:25.007
Of course I am,
until we leave here.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.680
These are people
I work with...

51:27.880 --> 51:29.723
I'm not here to work,
I'm on vacation.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.048
Me neither, but we saw them
on the beach

51:32.240 --> 51:33.730
and what else could I do?
Invite them.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.491
You said we were leaving
in two days.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.490
What's one more day?
Really...

51:39.680 --> 51:41.364
- I don't feel like it.
- Please.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.042
I don't understand, Miguel Angel.

51:46.320 --> 51:49.369
What do you want?
You want me to work in Madrid?

51:49.560 --> 51:52.450
To leave you here alone?
To get rid of me?

51:52.640 --> 51:55.166
Silvia, it's for your own sake.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.924
You do nothing here...

51:59.120 --> 52:03.091
Miguel Angel, please.
Are you serious? For my sake?

52:03.280 --> 52:03.849
Yeah...

52:04.040 --> 52:05.724
Leaving you here alone?

52:05.920 --> 52:10.323
And everything I've done so far,
leaving everything for you?

52:10.520 --> 52:14.002
Please, Miguel Angel.
Are you trying to get rid of me?

52:14.640 --> 52:15.482
No.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.247
I want you to get rid of me.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.170
Jesus Christ.

52:20.520 --> 52:25.686
Normal? Normal would be leaving.
You said we were days ago.

52:25.880 --> 52:28.326
But one more day
is no big deal...

52:28.520 --> 52:30.329
- Hi, there.
- Sixto...

52:30.520 --> 52:32.841
I'll go to Madrid with you.
I'll take the job.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.327
- Seriously?
- Yes.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.602
- Silvia, I'm so glad to hear it.
- Congratulations.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.290
That's wonderful.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.527
You can thank Miguel Angel.

52:40.720 --> 52:45.203
Let's go to the lsla del Colom
and celebrate. It's nearby.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.210
It's wonderful. It's a little
out of the way, but worth it.

52:48.680 --> 52:51.843
I promised a friend
I'd take her to the airport.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.444
Fernando, don't be
a stick in the mud!

52:55.640 --> 52:57.165
Look, say goodbye to coffee stains.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.204
We'll all go to the island
and have a great time.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.645
How are you?

53:13.360 --> 53:14.486
Fine.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.409
- How are you?
- Great.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.364
- How did you get here?
- On a scooter.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.085
What? Where's Fernando?

53:21.600 --> 53:23.568
He's on a boat with Miguel Angel.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.240
- And he let you?
- Yes.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.011
No. What about my suitcase?

53:29.400 --> 53:31.129
- I missed you.
- Me too.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.521
Thank you, Sixto.
It was great.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.246
- See you at the agency.
- Goodbye.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.408
- Take care of yourself.
- Thanks.

53:53.680 --> 53:54.920
- Bye.
- See you.

53:55.160 --> 53:58.607
I told you it was worth it.
The lsla del Colom.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.928
-It's amazing.
- Yes, very pretty.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.088
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.290
That sucked, man.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.687
Sucked? You made an ass
out of yourself, Fernando.

54:07.880 --> 54:08.847
- Who, me?
- Yes, you, damn it.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.849
All you had was shit
coming out of your mouth.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.166
How can he hire you?

54:12.360 --> 54:14.840
You never learn,
after all these years.

54:15.040 --> 54:18.806
I don't work at the agency anymore,
I can't give you anything.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.128
Either kiss his ass or go hungry,
it's up to you.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.606
You're not young anymore.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.567
-I'm doing a lot better.
- Yeah?

54:25.760 --> 54:28.411
Yeah. And Fer and I
got along very well.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.968
We complement each other
very well.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.164
So you two get along?
I was worried when I left.

54:34.360 --> 54:37.523
Yeah, because, I don't know.
He's very...

54:38.360 --> 54:42.445
-very adaptable.
- Yeah?

54:42.640 --> 54:44.449
Yes, very interesting.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.371
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:46.560 --> 54:48.767
- How are you?
- Fine.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.486
What's wrong?

54:50.680 --> 54:53.570
- Well, I got a little seasick.
- You look white.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.561
Are you okay?

54:56.760 --> 54:59.570
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm over it now.

54:59.760 --> 55:00.682
How was Madrid?

55:00.880 --> 55:02.723
Fine, really nice.

55:02.920 --> 55:07.528
Sorry I couldn't pick you up
because of this mess.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.723
Yeah, Olivia came on a scooter.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.083
The two of us on the back
with my suitcase...

55:13.600 --> 55:15.841
- Really?
- She almost had a heart attack.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.162
No, but that's fine.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.561
But you guys had fun, right?

55:24.760 --> 55:27.331
I just remembered,
I'm meeting Ainhoa for dinner.

55:27.520 --> 55:30.683
- I totally forgot.
- Tell her to come to dinner.

55:30.880 --> 55:32.769
No, we're going to Laia's.

55:32.960 --> 55:35.964
It's her turn, and she's never
cooked in her life,

55:36.160 --> 55:37.844
so we'll see what she makes.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.406
Please, step in for me.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.410
We're making eggplant
for a pisto.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.650
Thinly sliced.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.525
Okay, have fun.

55:49.760 --> 55:50.841
Have fun,

55:51.040 --> 55:52.530
both of you.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.680
- How do I cut this?
- Cut them in half.

55:58.880 --> 56:03.010
- Like this or...?
- No. Round and then in half.

56:11.360 --> 56:12.521
Hi.

56:12.840 --> 56:14.365
- How are you?
- Great, you?

56:14.560 --> 56:15.686
Great.

56:52.320 --> 56:53.560
Lluis?

56:54.360 --> 56:55.566
What are you doing here?

56:59.360 --> 57:00.361
Hi.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.369
I'd also like to thank you for
welcoming me here.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.801
-I've felt very at home.
- Yeah?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.128
I got along wonderfully
with Olivia.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.607
I'm glad because I didn't know
how she would react.

57:11.800 --> 57:15.122
She showed me all your work,
I've seen everything...

57:15.320 --> 57:19.211
I like your work very much.
Well, I think

57:19.400 --> 57:23.200
your presence is there,

57:23.400 --> 57:27.086
I see you in each woman,
each woman you draw

57:27.280 --> 57:28.691
or paint, right?

57:29.240 --> 57:33.404
And I've found a great deal
of communication. It's funny.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:35.560 --> 57:40.088
Without knowing you, I feel like
I know you very well. Right now...

57:40.600 --> 57:42.682
Seeing somebody's work...

57:42.880 --> 57:45.929
Yeah, it does have
a lot to do with the person.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.090
If I showed you my work,
it's Carrefour commercials...

57:49.280 --> 57:50.122
Of course.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.163
But they're also a testament.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.805
You mean my last words?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.163
No, I mean to who you are.
A commercial says a lot

57:57.360 --> 57:59.442
about the person behind it.

57:59.640 --> 58:06.410
Yes, but the director is given
very little space to maneuver.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.649
Someone accepting
to work for Carrefour...

58:09.840 --> 58:12.411
That also says something
about that person.

58:12.600 --> 58:16.127
In what sense?
Positively or negatively?

58:16.320 --> 58:18.766
I don't think it's either
positive or negative.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.405
I mean, it's real.
It is what it is.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.931
Right, yeah.

58:22.760 --> 58:25.047
Everyone has their own reality.

58:25.240 --> 58:28.244
Everyone picks what they want to do
with their life and...

58:28.480 --> 58:30.847
and how to develop their...

58:31.040 --> 58:34.408
What they can do
or what they want to do.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.843
I didn't know I would end up
making commercials.

58:38.040 --> 58:40.202
- I liked painting.
- Sure.

58:40.400 --> 58:44.200
And sculpting, which I never
got into because it's harder.

58:44.440 --> 58:48.604
With painting and drawing
you can do it whenever you want,

58:48.840 --> 58:51.889
but sculpting is more complicated.

58:52.880 --> 58:56.601
Well, you need
more infrastructure, of course.

58:57.720 --> 59:00.087
But I really love your studio.

59:00.280 --> 59:02.169
I love the whole house.

59:03.120 --> 59:07.250
It all looks so nice to me.
Like the song.

59:07.440 --> 59:10.011
Menorca has that quality.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.440
Yeah, but...

59:11.640 --> 59:13.961
Outsiders suddenly find themselves
on an island.

59:14.160 --> 59:17.130
But I think there's a lot
of your spirit here too.

59:17.320 --> 59:20.449
In the house, in the details...

59:20.960 --> 59:23.406
Those orchids,
the flowers drawn in,

59:23.600 --> 59:26.080
the poster over there...

59:27.120 --> 59:30.329
There's a little of you
in everything,

59:30.520 --> 59:34.241
you've done an amazing job
personalizing your work.

59:35.520 --> 59:37.761
Well, I've been at it for years.

59:38.320 --> 59:42.245
Remember the day
we went to pick up Tim?

59:43.960 --> 59:44.961
Yes.

59:46.280 --> 59:50.001
After you went home I was
meeting some friends for a beer

59:50.400 --> 59:52.084
and I ran into him.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.161
Hello. How are you guys?

59:55.440 --> 59:57.329
- How are you?
- Good, you guys?

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.490
I'm going to order a beer,
I'll be right back.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.407
Tim?

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.450
What are you doing here?

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.530
Damn!

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.608
No, stop for a second,
one second.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.125
I don't understand.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.087
Damn!

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.086
Tim, stop!

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.642
Airport.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.691
Airport.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.851
You didn't fly.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.611
"Nado, nadar."

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.280
No, "nadar" is this.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.130
"Volar."

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.929
Order... order another.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.970
Another, another?
Another.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.207
- Another.
- Another.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.648
Another! Another!

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.162
And we went to a cove.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.325
- A cove?
- For a swim.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.127
Cool, what a plan.
How fun!

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.402
- Yeah.
- A cove.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.807
Skinny-dipping, huh?
- No.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.408
To Sa Mesquida or...?

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.725
Was this before or after
you fucked?

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.605
Or during, or meanwhile,
I don't know.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.770
I've been straight with you,
I have to explain that too?

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.201
Yeah, draw me a sketch.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.004
- A conceptual map.
- Okay.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.850
- How cool.
- Perfect.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.611
I've never seen one.
Awesome.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.924
We went to Cami De Cavalls,
I wanted to show him Menorca,

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.767
and we've been together ever since.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.891
And that's everything.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.365
That's everything.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.602
That sums it all up,
that's everything.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.531
You wanted an explanation,
I gave you one.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.882
- This isn't how things are done.
- How are they done?

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.724
I don't know.
But not like this.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.921
I wasn't looking for it.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.043
No, it's bullshit.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.368
Did it have to be him?

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.921
You can both go fuck yourselves.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.246
- Excellent.
- Tasty, isn't it?

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.689
- You made it?
- Olivia.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.564
- She loves cooking.
- Olivia? Wow.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.805
Hey, I was thinking we could
go for a drink in Mahon.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.241
I'm really tired.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.646
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.729
After the trip...

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.048
Well, I also had the boat ride.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.846
But you go ahead,
go out for a drink. It's early.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.930
- To avoid calling a taxi...
- There's a bicycle.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:46.962
- There is?
- Yes.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.925
You can take it.
It's easy to find.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.690
It has a light?
Let's go.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.886
I'm going to clean up
and go to bed.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.365
Listen...

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.847
I was thinking that...

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.880
Damn, something about your face...

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.125
- What?
- I don't know.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.482
It's got this Etruscan quality.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Let's see.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.681
Show me a profile.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.446
Fernando...

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.165
I just don't know.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.443
Go out for a drink.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.486
- Why don't you come with me?
- Because I don't feel like it.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.082
And I don't feel like
you getting this close or...

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.089
- Okay, then...
- I mean...

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.569
- No, no.
- I don't know what you want.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.965
No, I wanted what's normal.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.651
What's normal?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.606
- You're a woman...
- So what?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.010
Miguel Angel's friend
who left you my house...

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.811
You've seen my work.
ls that normal?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.970
- And then you...?
- I what?

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.800
You stalk me.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.810
- Stalk you? I stalked you?
- Not stalked me,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.526
-but you make me feel awkward.
- I do?

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.562
Yes.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.606
Well, that's the last thing
I wanted to do.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.450
Well, you do.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.723
Yeah, because it's like
you have a right to.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.724
I didn't give you any,
I let you stay in my house...

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.083
Of course not,
nobody has any right.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.365
I don't have any right.
It's just that I like you and...

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.164
Well, I don't know.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.648
Get to know me a little,
there isn't much to like.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.648
- Well, I like...
- You've seen my work,

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.366
the island and my house,
nothing else.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.369
You got along great with Olivia,
that's it.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.801
- And I've seen you.
- Fine.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.570
But you don't know me.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.765
- I don't?
- No.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.049
And I don't like people...

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.924
You don't like me?

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.600
No, and I don't like
how you behave.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.925
I'm going to bed.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.002
No, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.082
Just that I'm sorry.
It's true that...

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.408
I don't know,
I guess I said the wrong thing.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.286
Don't take this like...

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.050
Know what your problem is?

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.287
You're looking for something in me

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.926
you should be
looking for in yourself

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.884
and that I can't give you.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.244
-I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.966
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.680
What were you doing?

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.003
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.328
- Nothing?
- Come on, I'll tell you.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.284
How did it go?

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.970
What happened?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.325
Hug.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.805
How was dinner?

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.521
Well, not too great, actually.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.602
I think he's a little lost.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.211
And you didn't like him.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.565
No, I didn't. And besides,
I can't help him.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.207
I don't know, for a second there
I thought you two might

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.206
fit together.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.402
Yeah, Mom, I know.
I'm sorry.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.762
Ijust really like him.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.322
I like him too, but

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.731
I was wrong.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.490
I'm sorry, because
I was the one who...

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.761
You were?

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.691
I may have gotten
his hopes up a little.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.486
What can I say?
I never know anything.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.331
I've had it, I swear.
I'm through.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.841
I'm through with men,
relationships, everything.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.282
Well, that's how you feel today.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.729
- No...
- You'll get over it.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.763
It's total bullshit.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.648
You were super happy
two days ago.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.490
Yeah, and I got fucked over.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.202
It's not fair.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:39.401
Why?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.809
Why do they say one thing one day
and the next day the opposite

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.810
and they end up hurting you
and after that

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.008
-you do the same thing.
- Let's go to bed.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.167
- You'll get through it.
- Can I sleep with you?

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.328
Yes, come on.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.249
- Mommy, I love you.
- I love you too.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.804
Hug.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.245
- Hi, Carlos.
- Good morning, Nuria.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.247
- You're not coming in?
- No.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:39.207
Okay.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:41.845
What's wrong?

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.207
Your mom shot me down.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.367
- I saw you guys.
- You did?

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.082
Damn. It's not just that,

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.369
everything is just falling apart
for me lately.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.447
Yeah.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.722
Tell me about it.
I saw Tim yesterday.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.807
Tim?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.604
Tim and Lluis.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.168
They've met someone else.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.561
Yeah?

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.160
It's like what I said.
Life sucks.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.766
No need to get so intense
about it.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.161
You can't take things
so seriously.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.649
Besides, the good things happen
when you least expect them.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.161
You have to learn
to have a little faith.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.644
Yeah, but I don't know.
I have zero hope for the future

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.123
and I don't feel like doing
anything.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.449
I feel like doing things,
and whatever happens after...

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.205
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm leaving.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.011
- To Miguel Angel's?
- No, anywhere else, I don't know.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.523
- Aren't you coming in?
- Yeah, right now.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.690
Mitiko and Olga are coming to lunch.
We have to make something.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.010
Stay for lunch.
You'll enjoy meeting Mitiko.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.560
Who is Mitiko?

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.406
An artist friend of my mom's.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.166
But she always says
very interesting things.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.328
Okay, I'll stay for lunch
and after...

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.806
Sure.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.369
- Chin up.
- Thanks.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.764
Can I serve anyone octopus?

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.610
- Carlos.
- No, thank you.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.926
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.282
-It's excellent.
- You caught it.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.090
- That's why.
- Very tasty.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.681
The octopus and I
have a special relationship.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.962
- Did you make it, Nuria?
- Yes.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.844
With Aunt Agueda's recipe.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.646
I have some, thank you.
It's very good.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.686
Aunt Agueda made it like this.
She loved cooking octopus.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.088
- Yeah? Aunt Agueda?
- Yeah.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.044
She took care of Grandma
and Matilde.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.890
- That's right.
- She killed herself.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:45.967
Did she?

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.284
- You don't know the story?
- No.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.168
She spent her whole life
taking care of...

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.567
First her father,

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.331
then, when Grandpa left,
Matilde

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.171
and Grandma.
And when they went to Madrid,

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.967
she was alone,
went into a depression,

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.322
and ended up committing suicide.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.002
Yeah?

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.488
- So she took the leap?
- Yes.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.526
How did she do it?
Who told you, Grandma?

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.131
- Grandma.
- She didn't tell me...

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.130
One day she finally lost her head,

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.006
on her way to a beach
in the south, a north wind...

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.087
- I swear.
- It just sounds...

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.725
She got in a boat...

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.969
She left a beautiful note,
with pretty handwriting

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.369
like the old days,
saying goodbye, got in the boat...

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.928
And she knew
that with the wind blowing north,

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.804
it affects you a lot

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.480
because it's a loud,
constant wind...

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.445
And she just headed south,
south, south...

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.684
She was never found.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.850
Suicide is very common in Menorca.
Lots of people do it.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.041
Tons.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.004
Well, before.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.205
And somehow I think

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.131
less people are doing it now
because

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.529
there's much more
human variety on the island.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.963
And before the island was,
let's say...

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.241
Very small.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.886
A limited territory,

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.644
and the people here
were the ones who were here.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.683
There was no Ryan Air.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.409
It was a closed island.
Now it's open. More open.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.402
Yes. And I think each suicide
has its reasons.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.290
Or two reasons to...

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.762
Fer?

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:10.962
Yes?

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.686
- Did you buy your ticket?
- No.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.884
I wasn't able to, look.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.249
- I get this thing...
- Let me see, move over.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.803
I don't know what
this security code thing is.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.411
- The CW?
- Yeah.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.603
Give me your card.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.084
-It was on the back?
- Yeah.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.480
CARD REJECTED

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.481
Damn.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.409
Have you got another card?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.082
Yeah, I have more,
but they're the same or worse.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.081
The truth is, I'm broke.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.526
We'll ask my mom for hers
when she gets back or...

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.570
I don't know.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.286
- Or Miguel Angel.
- Yes, Miguel Angel is better.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.209
Okay, then call him.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.088
I'm going to take Max
for a walk, okay?

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.008
Okay.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.122
Don't worry, everything
will work out.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.810
Okay, okay.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.642
Bye!

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.046
Maxi!

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.401
Come on.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.649
I got a flight, so you can be
alone like you wanted.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.080
You don't get anything.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.682
I'm going to Madrid...
Answer your cell phone.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.764
I know it is.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.408
Silvia, this can't end like this,
damn it.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.640
Miguel Angel?

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.606
Listen, something happened.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.961
Can you come over?
It's urgent.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.561
I do everything for you
and you don't even notice.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.167
Someone as smart as you.
I can't believe it.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.122
Everything...?

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.082
Yes, everything.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.123
So you wouldn't just sit here
and get bitter.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.966
Great. Then my mother comes
and you act like a jerk.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.004
And mope around all day.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.088
- Look...
- You're a bastard.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.085
- You're a bastard.
- But...

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.368
I love your mom,
she's awesome...

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.726
Oh, come on...

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.367
- You think my mom is awesome?
- Yes!

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.729
You love my mom,
I couldn't tell.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.844
I'll tell her to visit,
we'll see if you think she's awesome.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.090
Don't you get that
I did this for Fernando?

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.611
First my mom, now Fernando...
Make up your mind.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.564
I wanted him to come. I even
made up the documentary thing.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.081
- That's news to me...
-lt's news to you

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.607
but he was in a jam.
He's our friend

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.927
and you're not sensitive
at all to these things.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.929
- Hey...
-lt's true.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.482
You don't give a shit
about Fernando. He's in pain.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.443
What are you trying to say?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.246
His divorce, his job...

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.727
You're selfish.
And I'll tell you something:

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.685
Fernando is just fine
here on the island.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.689
He runs around
everywhere with Olivia.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.370
But you and I are not fine.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.767
And you don't realize because
you only look out for yourself.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.122
And right now I'm going
to close this suitcase

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.125
and I'll be out of your hair.
You're not leaving, I am.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.164
Okay, fine.
Have a nice trip.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.207
Hi.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.401
How are you?

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.322
- No.
- Where are you going?

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.167
Olivia, I want to talk to you.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.727
Wait.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.804
Go away, Lluis.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.930
Just go home!

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.122
Just listen to us.
You can do that after.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.560
Please, sit down.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.921
Listen.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.008
What is this, a joke?

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.691
We don't want to hurt you.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.603
We wouldn't have met each other...

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.647
if it weren't for you
and your tits.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.360
"Fish."

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.168
This is bullshit, Lluis.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.801
We hope...

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.286
I don't know why I came here.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.888
Look, Silvia, let's just drop it.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.367
I already dropped it before.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.721
This conversation is over.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.410
"It's over."

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.931
Let me take you to the airport.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.042
I called a taxi.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.049
Then cancel it!

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.566
<i>Something has happened.
Can you come?</i>

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.920
<i>It's urgent.</i>

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.320
Silvia.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.922
I have to go see Fernando,
I don't know what's wrong with him.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.561
And he leaves?

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.450
Fernando, what's going on?

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.563
I'll tell you later.
Let's go.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.727
- Where?
- To the airport.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.686
I'll have to pick up Silvia.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.562
- Is it serious?
- Drive.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.691
Damn.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.887
Fer! Fer!

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.289
Wait! Damn it!

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.849
- Mom!
- Max, why are you out?

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.566
- Where have you been?
- Why is Max out?

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.923
- Fer left for the airport.
- Where are you coming from?

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.088
- The house.
- Let me through.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.770
I need to leave this inside.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.645
Can we go and see him off?
He's leaving for Madrid.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.330
I'll just leave this.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.249
Please, Mom... No!

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.762
- What's the problem?
- Let's go. Please.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.527
What happened, Olivia?
What's with your hair?

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.487
- Nothing.
- Something happened.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.401
Fer wants to go back to Madrid.
Did you do something to him?

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.002
Did I do something to him?
Olivia, please...

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.802
- So tell me what happened.
- She rejected me.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.928
Damn, Fernando, you're unbelievable.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.566
Why?

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.211
What do you mean, why?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.289
How can I put this?

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.131
Fine, you fall in love
all the time, but...

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.806
- Me?
- You, you, you.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.924
Lorena from reception.
And before that,

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.681
Aurora, Laura the designer...
You never stop. But this time...

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.567
This time you went too far.
Way too far. No wonder...

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.724
I'm just surprised you haven't
gone to prison yet.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.888
Prison? What for?

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.406
Fernando, she's a minor!

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.881
You can't keep your boots on.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.162
You're not thinking...?

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.521
You're a filthy pig!

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.291
You think I'm a cradle-robber?

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.290
You're not talking about Olivia?

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.448
No, I'm talking about her mother!

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.603
- Oh, her mother!
- Of course, her mother. Nuria.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.122
Sorry about that, Fer.
I'm having a day... Damn!

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.323
-"L can't keep my boots on."
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.526
Well?

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.606
How was her mom?

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.366
Bad, I already told you,
but you don't listen to me.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.125
It's not that I don't listen to you,

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.563
this island has its own pace
and you rush things too much.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.082
This is the island of calm.
Like they say,

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.726
<i>Ppoc a poc.“
Neah, “pot. a pee.“</i>

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.369
She's the one who invited me.
She insisted I stay there.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.404
- To be closer.
- You're right, she did.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.011
Did I misread it?

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.407
No, this island just has
a life of its own.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.887
It's a living thing.
It welcomes you,

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.727
but if you push things,
the island rejects you...

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.049
Look, Fernando.
It rejected you.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.681
Yeah.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.569
- That's a taxi.
- Yeah.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.728
Damn is she stubborn!

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.331
I've been waiting for one hour.
One hour!

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.206
I told you I had a flight to catch.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.084
Talk to Fernando, it's his fault.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.926
No, it's your fault.
What does Fernando know?

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.083
Fernando, grab the suitcase.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.567
- What do I owe you?
- Thirteen euros.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.406
Thanks.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.207
- Okay...
- I don't want to hear it.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.563
Let him explain, this is his mess.
I had plenty of time.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:57.846
Jesus! It's not you, it's me.
I have to check in, damn it.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.204
You must have said
something to him.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.482
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.489
Mom, don't play dumb!

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.841
Did you have dinner with him
last night?

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.566
Fine, yes, I did...

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.089
You should think before
you treat people badly.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.404
That is such an exaggeration!

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.525
All that "save the world"
and "human footprint" stuff...

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.286
and the people closest to you,

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.608
you rip their hearts to pieces.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.563
- Olivia, please!
-lt's true.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.087
- Olivia, I swear...
- You're a heartbreaker.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.328
I didn't do anything.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.605
- What's wrong?
- I can't believe it.

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.080
Gasoline.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.569
I can't believe it. I think
I'm going to have an attack this time.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.843
Fill the tank when we leave!
This always happens to you!

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.884
This is too much!
Fernando, talk to him.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.650
Tell him I can't take it anymore.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.890
I'll need meditation
and acupuncture after this.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.889
And look how calm he is.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.006
We could be here for hours.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.767
There's nothing out here.
No cars.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.531
And look how calm he is.
He always does this.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.368
And that?

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.600
I don't know, what is it?

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.008
-It's a car.
- With a tree?

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.169
- Yeah, on top.
- Nuria!

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.842
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it's Nuria.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.406
Stop! Nuria! Stop!

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.370
This is great!

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.684
Just as well, just as well.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.961
Thank God.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.722
- We ran out of gas.
- What?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.729
Do you have a spare tank?

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.729
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.290
How is everything?

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.725
Well... they both came back
to my house.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.366
- They're in my bedroom.
- Really?

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.929
- But it's good?
- Yeah.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.250
I heard noises and...
Were you arguing?

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.090
No, I think we're in love.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.408
All three of you?
You're with both of them?

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.648
- Yeah.
- You don't say.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.366
Do you think it's possible
to love two people?

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.921
Loving one is tough,
maybe loving two is easier.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.365
-I'm going to help my mom.
- Okay.

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.564
Fernando, where were you going?

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.521
Since your hands were
already full and all that...

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.801
Where are you going?

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.128
- The airport.
- What?

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.527
Yeah, the island started
getting to me.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.768
Yeah? You can't handle it?

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.530
No, suddenly it's like...

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.007
Olivia said it's my fault.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.329
- Olivia said that?
- Yes.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.560
I don't know, maybe she's right.
I'm sorry if I...

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.443
Yeah?

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.768
- Yeah.
- No, well...

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.771
We have to take it slow.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.371
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.450
-"Poc a poc," like they say here.
-"Poc a poc."

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.529
I found it!

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.929
Fernando, quit chatting.
We're in a hurry.

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.009
Well, okay, then.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.601
Hey, that tree...

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.326
-lt's very pretty.
- They're roots.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.170
Roots? That's great.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.089
There's a poem by Tagore

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.124
that says
"Trees are the roots of the sky."

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.484
- That's beautiful.
- This reminded me of it.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.569
- Yeah.
- Completely.

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.208
I was trying to find a taxi.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.046
- You're my angel.
- What happened?

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.846
Suddenly everyone wants
to go to Madrid.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.121
Sixto?

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.000
Yeah?

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.682
In Menorca?

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.487
Of course, in Menorca.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.651
The thing is, you'd have to stay there
a little longer.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.687
To supervise Fernando's work.
You know, the creative touch.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.291
Great, yeah.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.761
Fer is right here, I'll put him on.
Okay, perfect.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.280
Sixto.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.001
<i>- Sixto?
- What's up, Fer?</i>

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.929
Your break is over!

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.690
Come on, I'm joking.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.521
Cheer up, Campofrio
is going to sponsor your documentary.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.328
And they said forget about
shooting on a thrift shop budget.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.966
They'll give you everything you need.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.367
Open bar, equipment...
Anything you want.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:24.961
Great.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.686
And give yourself a good salary.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.884
Don't hold back, I know you.
Ask for anything you want.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.411
Wow, thanks.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.011
Yeah, he's here.
I'll put him on.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.123
Sixto.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.129
You won't believe it.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.560
Sixto?

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.208
Hello? Yeah, yeah.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.327
Okay, I did what you said.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.807
I told them what you wanted me to say

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.402
and well, I might have gone
a little overboard. But it's done.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.564
But this is out of your pocket,
to the last euro.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.602
Of course.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.127
By the way, since we're
doing favors for each other,

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.447
you have to do one for me.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.166
Since I don't have your Silvia,

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.204
I have a situation here
with some clients

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.767
and I need you to come to Madrid.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.490
Not more than a couple of months,
maybe a little more.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.170
A favor for a favor.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.522
Yeah.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.960
Thanks.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.561
See you soon.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.888
Great. Bye.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.291
Fantastic!

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.766
We'll start with Nuria
interviewing Joan

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.167
and then we'll do close-ups.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.842
We should be done
in an hour and a half.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.601
Guys, give me a second.
This is the director, Fernando.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:54.882
Hi.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.402
Alfonso, director of photography.
Juana, his assistant.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.887
Carlos, Alberto, Antoine,

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.491
Montse, our photographer,

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.401
Silvia, our producer,
and you know the rest.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.251
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.524
- She's my assistant.
- Your assistant, great.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.210
Did we forget anyone?

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.324
Yeah, Laia Fuget,
Cap D'Agde Productions.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.288
We did forget someone.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.210
-I'm late. Hi.
- Hi.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.085
- This is Raki, your assistant.
- Nice to meet you.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.647
- My assistant?
- Yeah.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.286
- Always thinking ahead!
- Sorry.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.369
lam fucking stupid.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.971
Miguel Angel!

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.601
Well?

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.040
Having fun?

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.891
Look at you!

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.925
You got all dressed up
for the Americans!

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.168
You look so handsome!

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.011
Hey, one thing.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.407
Practice your English on the plane.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:54.648
-It's awful.
- Don't make fun of me.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.728
Don't complain.
You're always bitching.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.410
This rejuvenates you.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.365
Being here brings you down.
Think...

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.531
You got out of giving the speech
for the queen.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.960
You got out of it?

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.527
Of course, I have to go to the U.S.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.290
- Don't miss your flight!
- Too bad.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.641
Too bad?

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.207
- We're republicans.
- Yeah, but the queen...

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.803
Hey, one thing.
Since you're going to New York...

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.006
And you're going to see Sixto,
tell him I'm going to charge per week.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.204
Since it's a series and we don't
know how long it will last.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.802
-7,000 a week.
-7,000 euros?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.161
- Yeah.
- Per week?

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:35.842
It's a normal rate.
Sixto said it's no problem.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.201
I don't know...

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.326
He said to charge whatever I wanted.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:44.002
He said they're going to milk
this guy for cash.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.487
- This is the best crew on the island.
- Of course.

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.571
Excuse me. Alfonso says we have
a problem with the light

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.649
-and we have to get started.
- Okay.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.729
- I have to go.
- Have a good trip.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.127
Take care, everything will be fine.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.450
This is just to give me some
peace of mind. Talk to him.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.086
Okay, have a good trip!

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.808
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.369
How do you want to start?
With short interviews?

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.444
I'd rathe rjust start shooting.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.724
- Now?
- Yeah, without prepping.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.641
Okay, we're going to start.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.569
Nuria!

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.968
You guys, please.
We're going to start.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.447
Places everyone!
Guys!

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.290
Guys, keep it down.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.211
Here we go.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.050
Nuria, please.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:40.080
The taxi at 6 is impossible.
Cancel it.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.965
Be quiet!

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.049
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.201
Camera...

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.885
"Pretty Island," scene 1, take 1.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.721
Action!

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.605
PRETTY ISLAND

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:04.728
How has the island
changed since back then?

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.968
It was very peaceful, of course.

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.325
Everybody knew each other.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.922
You'd go to a beach
and there was nobody around.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.250
If you didn't see it for yourself,

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.886
you can't imagine
what it was like.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.845
But still, people who visit
the island

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.566
do get that feeling,

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.684
that things move
more slowly here.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.680
- Sure, people take it slow.
- It has another pace.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.045
Keep in mind that on the island,

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.040
for example, in a car, in 45 minutes

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.208
you've crossed the whole island.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.085
Imagine that. Imagine that.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.969
But anyway,
I think it's really nice.

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.442
We're used to living here.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.566
It's very quiet in the winter.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.401
In summer things get moving,
there are more people...

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.447
In winter there are
people who come here

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.042
and after a while
they get bored.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:14.562
It's harder for some people,
I admit I'm one of them.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.962
But anyway, those of us who
are used to it live wonderfully.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.801
When I was young I used
to go to Barcelona a lot

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.960
because my family
on my father's side

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.606
all lived in Barcelona.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.282
Cousins from back in my day,

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.245
and back then...

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.683
while here there wasn't
much to run after...

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.167
- To run after.
- Well...

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.004
You ran after some
in Barcelona.

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:53.286
And like I said, I had cousins
and friends from my day,

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.802
and every time
I went I had a blast.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.927
But after a few days,
I always wanted to come back.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.203
That happens to me too.

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.722
You get up there and
start running around...

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.562
<i>"I'll</i> miss the bus..."

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.286
I wasn't used to that.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.726
- I can run after some...
- Yeah.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.809
I get it.

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:25.768
I didn't mind running
after some at night.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.804
But after a few days,
I wanted to come back.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.130
There's one thing
that stood out to me.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:38.167
That someone from here
who you barely knew...

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.411
You run into them in Barcelona
or somewhere else

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.683
and suddenly they're
like a close friend.
