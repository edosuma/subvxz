WEBVTT

00:01.883 --> 00:05.991
So I was thinking, Woody,
you should buy me a new pet.

00:05.992 --> 00:10.023
Hell no. Every time I do, you do
a shitty job of taking care of it.

00:10.024 --> 00:12.893
That is nonsense. I
am totally responsible.

00:12.894 --> 00:15.234
Oh, really?

00:20.067 --> 00:23.170
Who are we to question God's plan?

00:23.171 --> 00:26.654
Sure, I've missed a couple
vaccinations and meals,

00:26.655 --> 00:28.901
but you can't pin that
hamster suicide on me.

00:28.902 --> 00:32.543
Wasn't that the cutest little
suicide note you ever saw?

00:32.543 --> 00:36.898
Look, I've changed. I promise I will
not let another pet die on my watch.

00:36.899 --> 00:42.799
Wait a minute. What happened to
that pony I got you last month?

00:46.335 --> 00:47.353
Aah!

00:47.354 --> 00:49.651
<i>♪ Brickleberry!</i>

00:49.652 --> 00:52.352
<i>♪ Brickleberry!</i>

00:54.717 --> 00:55.766
Listen up, Rangers.

00:55.767 --> 00:59.751
Brickleberry is hosting the Ranger
Games for the first time this year.

00:59.752 --> 01:02.587
I cannot stress how
important it is that we win.

01:02.588 --> 01:04.756
We're ready to rock!

01:04.757 --> 01:06.625
Uh, what are the Ranger Games?

01:06.626 --> 01:11.963
Only the most important competition
between all the world's Park Rangers.

01:11.964 --> 01:14.964
Ah, just watch this.

01:15.802 --> 01:18.922
Ooh, wrong tape. Here.

01:22.209 --> 01:25.257
On the evergreen tundra of the
world's most hallowed Park grounds,

01:25.258 --> 01:30.115
Rangers from around the globe gather
to compete for the coveted Golden Acorn.

01:30.116 --> 01:34.908
Goddamn Yellowstone has won the
Ranger Games every year since 1908.

01:34.909 --> 01:39.847
Ha ha! But now that Brickleberry's back
in the games for the first time since 1982,

01:39.848 --> 01:41.560
their reign is over.

01:41.561 --> 01:43.962
Why haven't we had a
team compete since 1982?

01:43.963 --> 01:47.085
- Yeah, uh, nobody knows.
- I know.

01:47.086 --> 01:50.702
Then in 1982 came the
Ranger Games' darkest day.

01:50.703 --> 01:54.306
Brickleberry's Woody Johnson was
near flawless in forest gymnastics.

01:54.307 --> 01:58.950
But he was beat out by 1/10th of a
point by Yellowstone's John Radcliff.

01:58.951 --> 02:01.124
What? This is hogshit.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.985
Aah!

02:04.517 --> 02:05.917
I'm a winner.

02:05.918 --> 02:10.058
You're being pissed on by a winner!

02:12.224 --> 02:15.310
At least you won the gold medal
for being a self-serving asshole.

02:15.311 --> 02:17.232
It's called cycling.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.185
Yellowstone wouldn't have
won shit if they'd have

02:19.186 --> 02:21.173
let blacks play in your
stupid Ranger Games.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.901
Instead, we had to compete
in our negro Ranger Games.

02:23.902 --> 02:26.671
Ah, Denzel, stop living in the past.

02:26.672 --> 02:30.141
The Ranger Games have been
fully integrated since 2008.

02:30.142 --> 02:34.111
So what sport you gonna dominate,
huh? Running? Jumping? Watching TBS?

02:34.112 --> 02:37.127
I'm gonna honor my hero
"frozen toes" Carruthers,

02:37.128 --> 02:39.873
the first black figure skater,
by competing in his event.

02:39.874 --> 02:42.676
God damn it! The one time you
could've been useful to me,

02:42.677 --> 02:45.389
and you pick the one sport
black guys aren't good at.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.132
That is so wrong.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.685
- They're also bad at swimming.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

02:49.686 --> 02:51.595
I'll do the log deadlift event.

02:51.596 --> 02:54.398
Lesbian super strength powers activate.

02:54.399 --> 02:55.432
I like to run.

02:55.433 --> 02:57.801
- Vag-first into boners.
- Shut up.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.829
So I'll take the deadly animal dash.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.773
And I'll compete in forest gymnastics.

03:02.774 --> 03:04.108
Forest gymnastics?

03:04.109 --> 03:06.577
- Hey, that's my old event.
- Exactly.

03:06.578 --> 03:08.445
I'm gonna make you proud, Woody.

03:08.446 --> 03:10.581
And since when are you a gymnast?

03:10.582 --> 03:11.916
I always loved the sport.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.451
They didn't have male
gymnastics in my town though.

03:14.452 --> 03:17.512
That didn't stop me.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.160
Oh.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.234
I see you went all out.

03:30.235 --> 03:31.898
Was the Home Depot out of Mexicans?

03:31.899 --> 03:36.406
No, they won't get in my car
anymore, since the pinata incident.

03:36.407 --> 03:39.076
Gather around, boys. It's payday.

03:39.077 --> 03:40.911
You're paying them with meth?

03:40.912 --> 03:44.121
Why not? It saves them a step.
Plus, it makes 'em work faster.

03:44.122 --> 03:45.873
- Thanks, boss.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:45.874 --> 03:47.250
This bag looks a little light.

03:47.251 --> 03:49.886
- Yeah, F.I.C.A. withholding.
- [Bleep] Obama.

03:49.887 --> 03:52.756
Keep up the good work, and you
boys just might get a raise.

03:52.757 --> 03:54.615
Thank you, Obama.

03:54.616 --> 03:56.126
Let's get back to work.

03:56.127 --> 03:57.361
What the...

03:57.362 --> 04:01.170
Wow, I can use that. Yeah,
this'll fit. This ought to fit.

04:01.171 --> 04:03.000
And who are you?

04:03.001 --> 04:06.469
Hobo Larry's name is Hobo Larry.

04:06.470 --> 04:08.271
- Yes, Sir.
- Hmm.

04:08.272 --> 04:10.972
Stray hobo, huh?

04:14.246 --> 04:17.781
Hey! Who the hell
took a shit in my boot?

04:17.783 --> 04:19.483
Oh, that must've been my new pet.

04:19.485 --> 04:22.021
Hobo Larry's sorry about that, yes, Sir.

04:22.022 --> 04:25.055
- W-won't happen again.
- You have a pet hobo?

04:25.056 --> 04:27.458
You wouldn't buy me my own
pet, so I had to make do.

04:27.459 --> 04:30.427
Okay. I see what's going on.

04:30.428 --> 04:32.321
You're doing this to screw with me.

04:32.322 --> 04:34.882
Well, fine. You want
a pet hobo, have at it.

04:34.883 --> 04:38.736
But if you let this one die, it's
the last pet you will ever get.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.605
You understand me? Ever!

04:40.606 --> 04:42.373
Thanks, Daddy.

04:42.374 --> 04:45.274
Now where's my other
boot? Oh, God damn it!

04:45.275 --> 04:48.069
Hobo Larry was wrong about that
whole shitting in the boot thing

04:48.070 --> 04:51.430
happening again, yes, Sir.

04:56.554 --> 04:57.788
Aah!

04:57.789 --> 05:00.429
Aah! Whoa! Aah!

05:02.633 --> 05:06.163
Yeah. This shit ain't for black people.

05:06.164 --> 05:09.629
How's it going, team Brickleberry?
Ready to kick some Yellowstone ass?

05:09.630 --> 05:13.230
I am. Check this out, Woody.

05:20.277 --> 05:23.048
Damn it. I guess I
should buy a male uniform.

05:23.049 --> 05:26.587
But it was still pretty awesome.
Right, Woody? What... Woody?

05:26.588 --> 05:28.415
Excellent, my new American friend.

05:28.416 --> 05:29.356
Who are you?

05:29.357 --> 05:34.057
Rangers, meet the ringer I hired to
ensure victory over Yellowstone...

05:34.058 --> 05:37.461
Olympic gold medal gymnast
Magnus Blickensderfer.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.431
Gymnast? B-b-but
that's my event!

05:40.432 --> 05:43.403
Oh, right, sorry, Magnus.
That's Steve's event.

05:43.404 --> 05:45.936
You'll have to get back on a
plane and go home to Switzerland.

05:45.937 --> 05:48.820
- Oh. Thanks so much, Wood...
- Oh, shut the hell up, Steve.

05:48.821 --> 05:52.443
Magnus ain't going anywhere. You suck
at everything, and you're off the team.

05:52.444 --> 05:55.546
Woody, you can't do this to...

05:55.547 --> 05:58.147
Ooh, uh, your... mm-mm.

05:58.148 --> 06:00.248
I know!

06:00.416 --> 06:02.130
So you're really an Olympic Champion?

06:02.131 --> 06:03.651
Yeah, but only twice.

06:03.652 --> 06:05.903
Wow. You won two events?

06:05.904 --> 06:08.938
No, I won two entire Olympics.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.584
Do you have a girlfriend?

06:10.585 --> 06:12.750
I'm saving myself for marriage.

06:12.751 --> 06:16.382
I cannot... how you say...
dip my meat in your fondue.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.851
But I can eat the
cheese all day and night.

06:18.852 --> 06:20.319
Oh, my.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.101
Oh, Ethel's just thinking
with her privates.

06:22.102 --> 06:23.689
I have a more intelligent question.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.858
Do you smoke the chronic?

06:25.859 --> 06:28.594
Good, you're all getting to know Magnus.

06:28.595 --> 06:32.195
I brought you breakfast, pal.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.534
Ah, don't waste energy
chewing your protein.

06:35.535 --> 06:36.702
I'll handle that.

06:36.703 --> 06:38.304
This'll digest nicely.

06:38.305 --> 06:41.749
And the second that turd
starts to crown, give me a call.

06:41.750 --> 06:45.478
Woody, why did you replace
me with this Swiss Miss?

06:45.479 --> 06:48.021
I told you, I'm good at gymnastics.

06:48.022 --> 06:51.377
Well, it's pretty simple.
Magnus is a winner. You're a...

06:51.378 --> 06:53.210
- Steve.
- Don't feel bad.

06:53.211 --> 06:58.224
Everyone seems like a Steve when you
compare them to Magnus Blickensderfer.

06:58.225 --> 07:01.302
Why don't you go back
to your stupid country...

07:01.303 --> 07:03.780
With its prosperous economy!

07:03.781 --> 07:07.832
And stick that Alemannic
dialect up your ass?

07:07.833 --> 07:10.535
Will you stop using
Wikipedia to insult him?

07:10.536 --> 07:13.560
Even if Magnus
burping-fur-burger

07:13.561 --> 07:17.241
is this "ringer" you claim,
there's one tiny problem...

07:17.242 --> 07:21.045
He has to be a ranger to
compete in the Ranger Games.

07:21.046 --> 07:23.481
Right. Thanks for the reminder, Steve.

07:23.482 --> 07:26.051
- Boom! Now he's a ranger.
- What?

07:26.052 --> 07:27.646
- Hooray!
- Hell yeah!

07:27.647 --> 07:30.183
You may have the badge, fondouche,

07:30.184 --> 07:33.726
but you're not a real Park
Ranger, so stay out of my way.

07:33.727 --> 07:34.807
Help!

07:34.808 --> 07:37.508
Watch and learn.

07:41.368 --> 07:42.835
Ow! Hurts!

07:42.836 --> 07:45.476
Aah! Hurts bad!

07:48.808 --> 07:54.708
Aw, he's like the son that I didn't let
drown in the lake because I was drunk.

07:56.315 --> 07:58.771
Magnus is too big for
the seat belt, yah?

07:58.772 --> 08:02.499
Yah. Listen, Magnus,
you seem like a nice guy.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.201
- I like you too, Steven.
- I didn't say I liked you.

08:05.202 --> 08:07.725
Look, I'll do anything
to get back on the team.

08:07.726 --> 08:09.527
So, I'm sorry about this.

08:09.528 --> 08:12.408
Sorry about what...

08:12.434 --> 08:14.466
So much for the ringer.

08:14.467 --> 08:18.907
- Steve, are you okay?
- How the... aah!

08:19.906 --> 08:22.724
Hobo Larry, how many times
do I have to tell you?

08:22.725 --> 08:25.425
No indoor fires.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.477
Well, how is Hobo Larry gonna keep warm?

08:28.478 --> 08:30.464
You ever hear of the thermostat?

08:30.465 --> 08:34.299
I got a thermos and a bat,
but the bat's dead. Yes, Sir.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.693
Look. I just need to
keep you alive for a week

08:36.695 --> 08:39.674
or two so Woody will
buy me a real pet, okay?

08:39.674 --> 08:43.095
Now here, eat your dinner.

08:44.212 --> 08:47.153
That's a good boy.

08:53.506 --> 08:57.766
Yeah, this'll fit. This ought to fit.

09:02.928 --> 09:05.690
I appreciate you taking
such good care of me.

09:05.691 --> 09:09.036
H-Hobo Larry loves you, Malloy.

09:09.037 --> 09:11.016
I love you, Hobo Larry.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.817
Uh!

09:14.220 --> 09:17.640
Mmm-mmm, re-barfed beans.

09:18.780 --> 09:20.081
What happened?

09:20.082 --> 09:21.282
We got into a wreck.

09:21.283 --> 09:22.584
- What?
- Are you okay?

09:22.585 --> 09:24.075
- Well, I-I...
- Some water?

09:24.076 --> 09:26.221
- A back rub?
- Over-the-drawers hand job?

09:26.222 --> 09:28.702
Broke my nose. Almost died.

09:28.703 --> 09:31.423
- Hello.
- Wow. They hate you so much.

09:31.424 --> 09:34.128
Shut up, Mal... oh, cool hobo.

09:34.129 --> 09:36.297
What is he, a wino? Junkie?

09:36.298 --> 09:38.365
He's a schizo-wino mix.

09:38.366 --> 09:42.369
I'm thinking of having his ears clipped.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.104
You guys, open your eyes.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.384
This jerk has you fooled
into thinking he's the best

09:46.385 --> 09:48.808
thing since Viggo Mortensen
erotic fan fiction.

09:48.809 --> 09:50.966
- Well, isn't he?
- No.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.674
What do you even know
about this foreigner?

09:52.675 --> 09:56.483
He could be a child molester
or a convict or a terrorist.

09:56.484 --> 09:59.026
Oh, that's rich... a Swiss terrorist.

09:59.027 --> 10:00.988
The Swiss are neutral, dumb-ass!

10:00.989 --> 10:04.289
Oh, boy, are you stupid.

10:04.626 --> 10:05.960
Ugh!

10:05.961 --> 10:07.609
All right, everybody, back to practice.

10:07.610 --> 10:11.870
Oh! Whoa! How you stop? How you stop?

10:11.900 --> 10:15.920
Screw this. I'm getting a Trainer.

10:16.471 --> 10:18.038
Yo, old-timer, wake up.

10:18.039 --> 10:19.573
Hey. Huh?

10:19.574 --> 10:20.942
What you want, punk?

10:20.943 --> 10:23.034
I was told that frozen
toes Carruthers lived here.

10:23.035 --> 10:24.845
- Are you him?
- I used to be.

10:24.846 --> 10:27.615
Now they call me "no toes" Carruthers.

10:27.616 --> 10:30.017
Oh, man. Did you lose
your toes to frostbite?

10:30.018 --> 10:31.819
Hell no! Diabetes.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.787
Oh. It's an honor to meet you.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.790
Listen, I need your help. I wanna
be a champion ice skater like you.

10:36.791 --> 10:39.026
- Can you teach me?
- Yes, I can.

10:39.027 --> 10:41.996
Or my name ain't "no penis" Carruthers.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.964
Damn, you lost that to diabetes too?

10:43.965 --> 10:45.432
Nah, frostbite.

10:45.433 --> 10:48.277
I got drunk and [Bleep] a snowman.

10:48.278 --> 10:51.518
Now let's get to work.

10:55.128 --> 10:59.028
Steve, I brought your Spanx back.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.383
Steve, are you okay?

11:02.384 --> 11:04.592
Go away, Connie. I wanna be alone.

11:04.593 --> 11:08.122
No way. You're not
going through this alone.

11:08.123 --> 11:10.291
Okay. This is weird.

11:10.292 --> 11:12.893
Expressing your feelings
is not weird, Steve.

11:12.894 --> 11:16.530
I want so badly to win my event
so Woody will finally respect me.

11:16.531 --> 11:19.264
Maybe I can cheat my
way back on to the team.

11:19.265 --> 11:22.002
Steve, listen to me. I know you're hurt.

11:22.003 --> 11:24.671
But you can't take shortcuts
just to win Woody's approval.

11:24.672 --> 11:26.440
Oh, like you'd know anything about it.

11:26.441 --> 11:29.851
Let me tell you a story about
a little girl, we'll call her,

11:29.852 --> 11:35.752
uh, Connie, who wanted to play
football so badly, she took steroids.

11:39.354 --> 11:41.574
Oh, yeah!

11:41.824 --> 11:45.797
They destroyed her mind and body
and turned her into a monster.

11:45.798 --> 11:49.458
Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie!

11:52.202 --> 11:56.371
So the lesson is don't ever take ster...

11:56.372 --> 11:57.706
Steve?

11:57.707 --> 12:00.809
I've never injected anyone
with this many steroids before.

12:00.810 --> 12:05.850
But that's why we call
it a medical "practice."

12:06.502 --> 12:11.962
Welcome to Brickleberry Park
and the 2013 Ranger Games.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.638
Aah!

12:18.347 --> 12:20.207
Ooh.

12:28.088 --> 12:29.441
Well, well.

12:29.442 --> 12:31.492
If it isn't Woody Johnson.

12:31.493 --> 12:36.130
I guess they'll let any psychopath
back in the Ranger Games these days.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.988
Radcliff, I will rip the
head off your mother's

12:38.989 --> 12:41.702
rotten corpse and make
her go down on herself.

12:41.703 --> 12:45.663
Hey, who you calling a psychopath?

12:46.025 --> 12:48.236
Oh, man, I'm missin'
the opening ceremonies.

12:48.237 --> 12:49.738
We gotta get this training started.

12:49.739 --> 12:52.107
- What's first?
- Iron my laundry, bitch.

12:52.108 --> 12:54.042
What? How is that
gonna help me ice skate?

12:54.043 --> 12:57.379
How dare you question
"crisp shirt" Carruthers?

12:57.380 --> 12:59.881
Now let's start the training montage.

12:59.882 --> 13:04.141
They don't call me "breaking the
fourth wall" Carruthers for nothing.

13:04.142 --> 13:05.742
Mop that floor.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.563
Cut that sandwich.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.039
Wipe my ass.

13:14.117 --> 13:17.753
I'm still not sure how bringing you
a keg of Colt 45 is training to be...

13:17.754 --> 13:19.674
What?

13:20.657 --> 13:23.659
I've been doing all these chores
just to set up some stupid party?

13:23.660 --> 13:25.060
I knew that wasn't training.

13:25.061 --> 13:27.228
You're right, son, that wasn't training.

13:27.229 --> 13:29.264
- This is.
- Gettin' drunk?

13:29.265 --> 13:31.931
My secret to skating
like a steed on speed

13:31.932 --> 13:35.771
is to do it while [Bleep]
up and liquor and weed.

13:35.772 --> 13:39.792
If it rhymes, it's gotta be true.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.970
What is it, boy?

13:48.752 --> 13:49.834
Oh, no.

13:49.835 --> 13:51.888
That's not one of your
regular scabs, buddy.

13:51.889 --> 13:53.517
That stray hobo bit you.

13:53.518 --> 13:55.391
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

13:55.392 --> 13:56.926
Bitten by a rabid hobo...

13:56.927 --> 13:59.028
Son, I'm afraid we'll
have to put your pet down.

13:59.029 --> 14:01.864
But don't worry. It'll
be extremely painful.

14:01.865 --> 14:04.232
- No!
- Well, okay.

14:04.233 --> 14:08.048
But if he shows any sign, you'll have to
follow the American Medical Association's

14:08.049 --> 14:13.869
guidelines and "cap that cracker
in his mother[Bleep] dome."

14:15.000 --> 14:21.074

14:24.254 --> 14:29.834
Now taking the ice for team
Brickleberry, Denzel Jackson.

14:33.463 --> 14:35.323
Woo!

14:44.977 --> 14:47.232
I hope I made you proud, Mr. Carruthers.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.832
Mr. Carruthers? Why, he died in 1998.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.068
This is Silly Willie.

14:51.069 --> 14:53.948
He has severe late stage
Alzheimer's. Very sad.

14:53.949 --> 14:57.819
They don't call me "where the
[Bleep] am I?" Willie for nothing.

14:57.820 --> 15:02.620
Now, for our final
event... forest gymnastics.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.392
Ha! Look at 'em, Magnus.

15:04.393 --> 15:08.496
You've got Radcliff so scared, he doesn't
even have someone to go up against you.

15:08.497 --> 15:12.697
The Golden Acorn is as good as ours.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.172
You guys, I'm really
worried about Steve.

15:17.173 --> 15:18.807
I can't find him anywhere.

15:18.808 --> 15:22.459
Competing for team
Brickleberry, the Swiss fist...

15:22.460 --> 15:25.460
Magnus Blickensderfer.

15:27.281 --> 15:33.181
And for team Yellowstone, the
ranger of danger Steve Williams.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.264
What's up, bitches?

15:38.194 --> 15:40.996
Steve, what did you do to yourself?

15:40.997 --> 15:43.566
I took a shit-ton of
steroids, like you told me to.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.334
I never told you to do that.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.435
You implied it.

15:46.436 --> 15:48.304
And now look at the Steve...

15:48.305 --> 15:49.405
He's ripped!

15:49.406 --> 15:50.740
Did you work out at all?

15:50.741 --> 15:51.874
You have to work out?

15:51.875 --> 15:53.809
What the hell good are steroids then?

15:53.810 --> 15:58.730
Ah, doesn't matter. I'm
gonna win either way.

16:03.887 --> 16:06.588
Uh, I think the 'roids are
messing with your emotions, Steve.

16:06.589 --> 16:08.758
Shut your fat filthy whore mouth!

16:08.759 --> 16:11.693
I'm sorry, Connie. I always loved you.

16:11.694 --> 16:13.274
Eat my balls in hell!

16:13.275 --> 16:14.551
Why would you do this?

16:14.552 --> 16:17.199
Nothing is more important
than winning, Connie.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.704
You're just jealous, because
the Steve is a winner!

16:21.705 --> 16:23.806
Please, the Steve, listen to me.

16:23.807 --> 16:27.005
- I'm your friend.
- I don't need friends.

16:27.006 --> 16:30.606
I need to crush that ringer.

16:34.685 --> 16:36.852
Okay, my balls just disappeared.

16:36.853 --> 16:38.811
Oh, God. What am I doing?

16:38.812 --> 16:40.089
What have I become?

16:40.090 --> 16:42.224
Everyone, can I have your attention?

16:42.225 --> 16:43.592
I have something to say.

16:43.593 --> 16:46.862
Hey, Adele, shut up and
sing Rolling in the Deep.

16:46.863 --> 16:48.157
In a minute.

16:48.158 --> 16:51.365
I, Steve Williams, am
withdrawing from this event.

16:51.366 --> 16:52.850
What? Why?

16:52.851 --> 16:56.568
Because I've hurt everyone I
care about, including my nuts.

16:56.569 --> 17:00.237
I thought winning was the most
important thing, but it isn't.

17:00.238 --> 17:02.971
Family is, my Brickleberry family.

17:02.972 --> 17:07.702
I pushed all of you away, even
this cool new guy named Magnus...

17:07.703 --> 17:09.242
Bird-turd-[Bleep].

17:09.242 --> 17:11.298
That was a nice speech, the Steve.

17:11.299 --> 17:14.246
And you're right, I will
totally be friends with you.

17:14.247 --> 17:16.982
Right after I blow this entire place up!

17:16.983 --> 17:19.383
Yah! Oh-ho!

17:20.438 --> 17:22.217
Magnus is a terrorist?

17:22.218 --> 17:24.117
I was right. Yes!

17:24.118 --> 17:26.693
I told you! In your face!

17:26.694 --> 17:29.684
Oh, great. I'm lactating.

17:29.685 --> 17:31.706
Stay where you are.

17:31.707 --> 17:33.899
This whole place is littered with bombs,

17:33.900 --> 17:37.642
all wired to this detonator
in my Swiss Army knife.

17:37.643 --> 17:39.574
But... but you're Swiss.

17:39.575 --> 17:41.175
How could you be a terrorist?

17:41.176 --> 17:45.980
Because the world mocks us for being
neutral, for not choosing a side.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.703
So I vow to destroy both sides.

17:48.704 --> 17:51.074
I'm really confused by your message.

17:51.075 --> 17:52.309
Hey, I'm Swiss.

17:52.310 --> 17:54.478
I'm new to the whole
terrorist thing, yah?

17:54.479 --> 17:57.481
Now shut up and prepare to die.

17:57.482 --> 18:00.250
Sorry, guys. This is all my fault.

18:00.251 --> 18:03.520
I really effed us in the
ass good, deep, and hard.

18:03.521 --> 18:05.021
Not yet you haven't.

18:05.022 --> 18:07.123
One of us has the
power to beat Magnus...

18:07.124 --> 18:10.194
The power of steroids.

18:10.195 --> 18:13.735
Do it for Brickleberry, son.

18:13.965 --> 18:15.547
Let's dance.

18:15.548 --> 18:19.466
Don't come any closer, fat man,
or everybody goes boom, yah?

18:19.467 --> 18:20.692
Easy now.

18:20.693 --> 18:24.097
Drop the knife full of useless attachments,
and we can settle this like men...

18:24.098 --> 18:25.262
Through gymnastics.

18:25.263 --> 18:27.811
You don't have the
balls to take me down.

18:27.812 --> 18:29.102
Literally.

18:29.103 --> 18:30.626
That's far enough.

18:30.627 --> 18:34.042
Death to some small part of America.

18:34.043 --> 18:36.185
I thought I wired the scissors.

18:36.186 --> 18:38.090
Magnifying glass? No.

18:38.091 --> 18:39.530
Nail file? No.

18:39.531 --> 18:41.095
Fish scaler? No.

18:41.096 --> 18:42.659
Bubble wand? No.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.276
Pregnancy test? No.

18:44.277 --> 18:45.550
Lipstick? No.

18:45.551 --> 18:46.737
Chapstick? No.

18:46.738 --> 18:48.324
Stain stick? No.

18:48.325 --> 18:49.702
Glue stick? No.

18:49.703 --> 18:51.190
Glow stick? No.

18:51.191 --> 18:52.510
Blow torch? No.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.558
Smaller Swiss Army knife? No.

18:54.559 --> 18:55.678
Baby dildo?

18:55.679 --> 18:57.539
Aah!

19:21.338 --> 19:23.699
You did it, Steve. You saved us.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.540
That was amazing.

19:25.541 --> 19:30.161
Sorry I ever doubted
your gymnastic skills.

19:30.707 --> 19:33.776
The Judges have a winner
for the gymnastics event.

19:33.777 --> 19:35.577
Wait. They were judging that?

19:35.578 --> 19:38.681
A perfect score for Steve Williams.

19:38.682 --> 19:41.684
I can't believe it. I won! I won!

19:41.685 --> 19:45.367
With that victory, the
Golden Acorn goes to...

19:45.368 --> 19:48.668
Yellowstone National Park.

19:49.126 --> 19:50.526
God damn it!

19:50.527 --> 19:53.587
Die, Steve, die, die!

19:53.873 --> 19:55.184
It's like a hug...

19:55.185 --> 19:59.565
A violent hug that's slowly killing me.

20:04.607 --> 20:06.107
No, Woody.

20:06.108 --> 20:08.076
There's no hope for him now, Malloy.

20:08.077 --> 20:09.377
He's sufferin'.

20:09.378 --> 20:11.546
You know what we've gotta do.

20:11.547 --> 20:12.647
I know, Woody.

20:12.648 --> 20:16.488
But he's my hobo. I'll do it.

20:25.035 --> 20:27.824
- Hello?
- Hi, Malloy. It's Dr. Kuzniak.

20:27.825 --> 20:32.245
I just wanted to let you know that
there's no such thing as hobo rabies.

20:32.246 --> 20:37.406
Turns out I was tripping balls
on ecstasy yesterday. Bye.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.266
Poor old Hobo Larry.

20:39.267 --> 20:43.421
I'm gonna make sure he
gets a proper funeral.

20:43.422 --> 20:47.182
One of these days, Malloy, you are
gonna kill something that won't flush.
