- Hey, now, that's a great idea.
- Sure.

09:09.649 --> 09:13.017
Uh, how much are you going
to pay me?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.645
I'm talking fame, not bucks.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.223
(Skip laughs)

09:17.357 --> 09:20.224
Nice try. (laughs)

09:20.360 --> 09:22.988
Run it down the flagpole.
Nobody saluted.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.893
Well, time for plan three.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.295
Right. I grovel and weep
at his feet.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.529
No. Look, Fonzie told me
what to do if this guy said no.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.865
Now watch.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.002
Well...

09:37.143 --> 09:39.475
Oh, Skip baby,
you know, I can't believe

09:39.612 --> 09:41.512
I'm standing next
to the Dean of Teens,

09:41.648 --> 09:44.549
the Ace of Rock, and the King
of Pop in the flesh.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.709
Look, I'm getting goose bumps.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.682
(Skip laughs)

09:50.824 --> 09:52.383
- Hey, I like this boy.
- RICHIE: Yeah. -Yeah.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.153
- Yeah, when do we audition?
- You got three minutes.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.059
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's set up. Thanks.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.358
- No problem.
- Thanks.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.626
- Oh, hey, Rich, Rich?
- Huh?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.702
Oh, come on.
Can't you wait three minutes?

10:05.405 --> 10:09.501

- Oh. All right. -Yay.
- Did you write that yourself?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.646
- Yeah. -You bet
your white bucks she did.

12:38.791 --> 12:39.986
Here's her tape, too.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.992
Okay, so when can we be
on your show?

12:42.128 --> 12:43.596
- You can't.
- RICHIE & RALPH: Huh?

12:43.730 --> 12:46.290
If you're not on the charts,
you're not on Sok Hop.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.491

Oh.

12:48.635 --> 12:51.605
<i>RICHIE: You know, basketball is
the best way in the world</i>

12:51.738 --> 12:53.263
<i>to cheer yourself up.</i>

12:53.406 --> 12:56.569
Well, Leather, we certainly
showed them a thing

12:56.709 --> 12:58.177
or two about basketball.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.211
Where did you get
that hook shot, Mrs. C?

13:00.346 --> 13:01.541
Well, it's family tradition.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.378
- Mother Kelp taught me.
It's all in the wrist. -Oh.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.179
- Wish I had a teammate who could
dribble. -(ball bouncing)

13:07.320 --> 13:09.379
Where does it say
in the rule book

13:09.522 --> 13:12.457
that you can't dribble
with two hands? Huh?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.617

13:20.800 --> 13:22.234
"Moonlight Love."

13:22.368 --> 13:24.496
Oh, I'm winded.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.106

13:31.678 --> 13:32.873
HOWARD:
What?

13:33.012 --> 13:35.743
My song's been stolen!

13:40.687 --> 13:42.086
You-- I want to talk to you.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.746
That dance you wrote
for me special, huh?

13:43.890 --> 13:46.257
My legs love it! Hey.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.521
Why is everybody's face lower
than a midget ant?

13:51.097 --> 13:53.566
Fonzie, someone stole
Leather's song.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.225
Had to be Skip Oliver, too.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.233
LEATHER:
Yeah, imagine.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.632
Skip Oliver a thief.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.135
Well, just a second now,
Leather.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.400
You know, that's a pretty strong
accusation.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.100
Dad, we auditioned for him.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.973
I mean, I handed the tape
to Skip Oliver myself.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.602
All right,
that's all I got to hear.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.377
Sok Hop, Chicago, 4:00 o'clock,
get your instruments, be there!

14:13.286 --> 14:15.516
Wait. Fonz, wh-what are you
gonna do to Skip Oliver?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.756
He's such a good neighbor.

Hey, take off your shoes

15:19.185 --> 15:21.415
I don't know.
He said he'd be here at 4:00.

15:21.554 --> 15:25.513
And let's start things off right
now with a spotlight dance!

15:45.678 --> 15:48.147
Joanie, what do you call
that dance he's doing?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.909
The swim, Mom,
but the way Richie's doing it,

15:51.050 --> 15:52.848
it looks more like
he's drowning.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.976
(upbeat instrumental
rock song playing)

16:12.772 --> 16:14.740

16:14.874 --> 16:16.171
- What?
- Seen him.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.902
Well, I don't see him.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.172
Oh, yeah, there he is.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.281
- Oh!
- Gee, he needs a haircut.

auditioned for you right here.

You glommed her song from her.

And you gave it to, uh,
Freddie and the Red Hots.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.056
I did? W-Why would I do
a thing like that?

18:12.191 --> 18:13.920

Look at this.
Look at this, huh?

18:15.995 --> 18:18.123
I'm looking
at a blank face here.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.323
You don't know anything
about this, do you?

18:20.466 --> 18:24.164
I don't. Actually, uh,
I'm not very bright.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.397
FONZIE:
Hey, uh, I made a little

18:26.539 --> 18:27.631

I'm gonna make it up to you.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.010
Wait a minute.
I can't do that.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.243
I've already announced
Freddie and the Red Hots.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.750
Hey, hey, hey,
the man is a thief.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.752
Yeah, you're right,
and he'll never be back

18:42.888 --> 18:45.619
in this show again,
but I can't cancel them now.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.783
He's got a new dance,
and I promised the kids.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.419
I can dig it, I can dig it.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.190
You know, I'll tell you
something Skippy, huh?

18:52.331 --> 18:54.425
You look great for your age.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.433
SKIP:
Fellow teenagers,

19:01.574 --> 19:02.803
are you ashamed
to leave the house

19:02.942 --> 19:05.206
because of unsightly blemishes?

19:05.344 --> 19:06.539
RICHIE:
Fonz,

19:06.679 --> 19:07.737
everything's all set, huh?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.314
Wrong. We're breaking camp.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.472
We're going on a hike?

19:10.616 --> 19:13.347
Will you just follow me?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.477
RICHIE:
Oh.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.591
You know, in this crazy,
mixed up, beautiful business

19:20.726 --> 19:24.560
that I'm fortunate enough
to be a giant in,

19:24.697 --> 19:27.291
acts come and go,

19:27.433 --> 19:29.697
but the biggest stars
continue to shine.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.965
Which makes today's guest one
of the brightest guys I know.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.268
The heavyweight champs of rock
and roll,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.810
Freddie and the Red Hots!

19:38.944 --> 19:41.038
-(applause and cheering)
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.581
God bless you, man.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.083
You stole "Moonlight Love."
You're finished. (laughs)

19:46.218 --> 19:48.983
Let me, uh...let me tell you
something about this man

19:49.121 --> 19:53.319
who is truly
a recording artiste.

19:53.459 --> 19:57.157
It all began in 1954
when, uh, Freddie was discovered

19:57.296 --> 20:00.994
singing in a hotel
in the Catskills.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.797
From there, he recorded a string
of classic wax.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.530
Unforgettable hits like

20:06.672 --> 20:09.937
"Memory Lane", "Lover's Lane",

20:10.076 --> 20:14.206
"Come Back, Elaine",

20:14.346 --> 20:17.213
and many, many, many more.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.114
And now, in this second decade
of performing,

20:20.252 --> 20:24.519
this musical pioneer is still
blazing trails in rock and roll.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.716
(applause)

20:31.030 --> 20:33.431
You're a thief.
Get lost.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.000
Yeah, I stole the song.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.193
What are you gonna do
about it, punk?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.800
You don't go around
calling people punks.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.313
Why not? I'm not getting pushed
around by any two-bit hood.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.975
You care to wager?

21:05.731 --> 21:08.132
And here they are with a new
dance, the moonlight stomp,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.326
the ever popular...

21:10.469 --> 21:12.460
Hey, you're not
the ever popular.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.041
Right again. Give me that thing,
I'll show you how to use it.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.700
Which one's my camera?

21:17.843 --> 21:19.004
Oh, uh, uh, this one here.

Yeah?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.374
How you doing out there?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.712
You want a new dance?
I got a new dance.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.649
And it's gonna be done
by a friend of mine,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.186
soon to be friend of yours.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.449

21:37.663 --> 21:39.290

some more friends of mine,

21:43.469 --> 21:46.530
