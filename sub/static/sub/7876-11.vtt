00:23.266 --> 00:24.440
synchro: mpm

00:34.375 --> 00:36.318
Francine, if your cooking
gets any better

00:36.443 --> 00:40.195
I'm gonna have to get a stomach staple,
then bust it out Roker-style.

00:40.491 --> 00:43.000
Poor Roker.
He will always be fat.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.174
It's this new deep fryer.

00:45.299 --> 00:48.441
It just makes every
single thing delicious.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.920
Look, I dropped my pen
in there by mistake.

00:53.027 --> 00:54.135
Fantastic.

00:54.658 --> 00:56.525
Speaking of things fantastic,

00:56.650 --> 00:57.838
behold.

00:57.963 --> 01:00.434
I've sewn on all
my new scout badges.

01:00.706 --> 01:02.257
That's for pervert awareness,

01:02.382 --> 01:04.131
that's for interior design

01:04.256 --> 01:05.815
and that one's sushi.

01:06.123 --> 01:10.069
I can identify over 60 types of sushi
with their correct Japanese names.

01:10.345 --> 01:12.253
Unagi, hamachi...

01:12.526 --> 01:14.052
salmon roll.

01:15.322 --> 01:17.157
What ever happened
to "pitching a tent?"

01:17.282 --> 01:19.281
That was part of
"pervert awareness".

01:20.845 --> 01:23.272
Lines like that are what earned me
my zinger badge.

01:23.747 --> 01:26.544
Okay, let's see who made
the crime beat today.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.451
No better way to shame
a first-time petty lawbreaker

01:29.576 --> 01:32.322
than by plastering their picture
all over the paper.

01:32.447 --> 01:34.558
- My God, guess who's in here?
- Santa?

01:34.683 --> 01:36.637
It's a local crime beat.

01:36.982 --> 01:38.708
- Is it Hayden Panettiere?
- Who?

01:38.833 --> 01:40.824
I don't even know who...
It's a local... Forget it.

01:40.949 --> 01:43.366
- It's Kristy White.
- What'd she do?

01:43.491 --> 01:46.860
She got busted getting high
in the parking lot of the multiplex.

01:46.985 --> 01:50.122
- What movie was she seeing?
- The new Pixar movie,<i>Clothes</i>.

01:50.358 --> 01:52.486
It's about the secret lives
of clothes.

01:52.611 --> 01:54.575
John Ratzenberger plays a tie.

01:56.679 --> 01:59.278
Hey, neighbor.
Nice mug in the local crime beat.

01:59.403 --> 02:02.584
Listen, I just mowed my lawn.
You wanna smoke the excess grass?

02:04.499 --> 02:07.136
My wife's brought shame to
my entire family.

02:08.015 --> 02:10.812
I guess you ate a slice
of "Humboldt" pie.

02:11.354 --> 02:14.319
Like Humboldt county
where they grow the best stuff?

02:14.573 --> 02:17.373
I have no idea how I know that.
I blame rap lyrics.

02:17.498 --> 02:18.763
Damn you, Heavy D.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.796
First I engaged in hyperbole,
then I made a pun,

02:22.921 --> 02:24.257
and finally I blamed rap.

02:24.382 --> 02:26.562
- There, you're all caught up.
- That is so unfair.

02:26.934 --> 02:28.731
The law against pot makes no sense

02:28.856 --> 02:31.609
and people shouldn't be publicly
shamed for not following it.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.236
Hayley's against the pot laws.

02:34.618 --> 02:36.905
Well, like it or not,
Hayley, it's the law.

02:37.030 --> 02:38.868
Laws protect us and create order.

02:38.993 --> 02:42.397
We don't question them, we obey them.
Or they put you in the paper.

02:42.522 --> 02:43.896
Well, it's a stupid law.

02:44.021 --> 02:46.207
Well, I think your face
is a stupid law.

02:46.694 --> 02:48.825
I was captain of the debate team
in high school.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.814
Well, because the rest of the team
died in a horrible bus accident.

02:51.992 --> 02:53.992
They based that movie
<i>The Sweet Hereafter</i> on it.

02:54.117 --> 02:55.971
Never saw it.
Francine wanted to see it,

02:56.096 --> 02:58.310
but I convinced her
to see <i>Ace Ventura 2</i>.

02:58.435 --> 03:01.616
Because I was captain
of the debate team. And we're back in.

03:01.741 --> 03:03.057
Hayley, here's what I know:

03:03.364 --> 03:06.895
I'm off to deliver food to the elderly
to earn my gerontology badge.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.480
I have this bike helmet
which crushes my ears,

03:09.605 --> 03:12.163
itches my head, and gives
me Bonnie Franklin hair.

03:12.288 --> 03:14.698
Now, why do I wear it?
Because it's the law.

03:14.823 --> 03:16.741
- Right, Dad?
- Right, Steve.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.588
Good kid.

03:20.851 --> 03:21.999
Going the wrong way.

03:22.124 --> 03:23.661
I get turned around sometimes.

03:26.566 --> 03:28.266
1,199,

03:28.616 --> 03:29.500
1,200.

03:30.881 --> 03:31.701
Pretty.

03:32.940 --> 03:33.755
One,

03:34.304 --> 03:35.262
two...

03:35.875 --> 03:38.122
- Did I miss happy hour?
- Yeah, just.

03:41.366 --> 03:44.534
- What's troubling you, friend?
- My great aunt has died.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.998
Will you look at...
Somebody picked out all the wasabi peas.

03:48.175 --> 03:50.447
When's the next time I'm
gonna get to Trader Joe's?

03:50.572 --> 03:52.022
The parking lot's a nightmare.

03:52.712 --> 03:53.754
Anyway,

03:54.156 --> 03:55.722
there was a notice in the paper.

03:55.847 --> 03:58.904
Some lawyers in D.C. are looking for me
to give me an inheritance.

03:59.629 --> 04:01.156
Okay, not bored yet.
Keep talking.

04:01.498 --> 04:04.016
They say I have to claim
the money in person,

04:04.141 --> 04:07.091
but I can't because the CIA
made me a freaking fish!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.350
Well, now bored.

04:12.062 --> 04:12.879
Three...

04:13.364 --> 04:16.334
four... I'll be the best-looking
one at the car show.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.214
Five... six.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.757
Wait a minute.

04:20.863 --> 04:23.345
You are given to disguises
from time to time, yes?

04:26.327 --> 04:27.543
If it's the same Roger

04:27.668 --> 04:29.788
who takes pints down
at the Cat and the Fiddle,

04:29.913 --> 04:31.663
he is prone to disguises.

04:31.870 --> 04:35.091
I also hear he's wanted in a string
of prostitute murders, he is.

04:35.657 --> 04:36.589
<i>Wunderbar</i>!

04:36.714 --> 04:39.172
You can pretend to be me,
go to the lawyers' office,

04:39.297 --> 04:41.030
and claim the inheritance.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.971
I do like pretend...

04:43.289 --> 04:44.615
but I don't like you.

04:45.078 --> 04:46.778
But I do like lawyers...

04:47.137 --> 04:48.771
but I don't like offices.

04:49.132 --> 04:50.832
But I do like peaches...

04:51.765 --> 04:53.692
Throw in a peach and I'll do it.

04:56.001 --> 04:57.669
<i>Who loves cute little kitties?</i>

04:57.794 --> 04:58.679
<i>Guilty.</i>

04:58.804 --> 05:00.113
<i>Then you'll love this.</i>

05:00.238 --> 05:03.049
<i>The city pound is now keeping
cats for only two days</i>

05:03.174 --> 05:05.047
<i>before they have them destroyed.</i>

05:07.094 --> 05:08.878
<i>In other news, citing
health concerns,</i>

05:09.003 --> 05:10.848
<i>the Langley Falls city
council has banned</i>

05:10.973 --> 05:13.781
<i>the sale, use and consumption
of all trans fats.</i>

05:13.906 --> 05:17.274
Which is good news for health nuts,
bad news for Kirstie Alley.

05:19.304 --> 05:21.645
Now you reminded me
of the dead kittens.

05:24.235 --> 05:26.867
Well, if that's the law,
then we're gonna have to follow it.

05:29.323 --> 05:31.502
What the hell, Francine?
This tastes like crap!

05:31.627 --> 05:32.627
I know.

05:32.752 --> 05:35.872
I used to cook everything
in oil containg trans fat,

05:35.997 --> 05:38.420
but since the new law,
you can't get it anymore.

05:38.662 --> 05:40.317
That's what trans fat is?

05:40.442 --> 05:42.453
The stuff that makes
everything taste wonderful?

05:42.578 --> 05:45.350
Why doesn't the city council
just declare a war on flavor?

05:45.475 --> 05:47.188
Like the English did years ago.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.682
- Their food is atrocious.
- I miss Lady Di.

05:49.968 --> 05:52.400
- She was the peoples' princess.
- I know who she was, Steven.

05:52.525 --> 05:54.278
You know what?
If the city council says

05:54.403 --> 05:56.716
I have to live without
trans fat, so be it.

05:56.841 --> 05:59.039
Won't stop me from
enjoying my dinner.

06:07.846 --> 06:10.744
Good boy, Cheesers.
Later we'll go for ice cream.

06:37.044 --> 06:39.396
Because corn dogs are fried.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.473
I haven't seen you
round these parts.

06:51.598 --> 06:54.246
Well, I was hanging out over there
by the batteries for a while,

06:54.371 --> 06:56.206
but, yeah, now I'm here...
in this part.

06:57.202 --> 06:59.801
You know, as long as I'm here,
I might as well do my marketing.

06:59.926 --> 07:03.921
- Anything I can help you find?
- Well, there is one thing...

07:06.241 --> 07:08.385
Are you gonna tell me what it is?

07:49.357 --> 07:51.261
You know what,
I'm just gonna eat at my desk.

08:25.362 --> 08:26.921
I want you in my mouth!

08:27.622 --> 08:29.228
Are you alone in there?

08:30.420 --> 08:32.288
What's going on in there?

08:32.576 --> 08:34.157
I smell good things,

08:34.282 --> 08:36.919
And I've never smelled good things
in here before.

08:38.092 --> 08:39.331
Be out in a moment.

08:41.490 --> 08:42.683
Finishing up now.

08:44.401 --> 08:46.720
Just one guy left...
he fell behind his friends.

08:50.648 --> 08:52.216
Why do you have a fork?

08:53.224 --> 08:55.264
It's not a pretty story, sir.

08:55.843 --> 08:57.000
Withdrawn.

09:03.016 --> 09:05.920
Remember, Roger, if you're gonna
help me get that inheritance,

09:06.045 --> 09:08.391
- you're going to have to be me.
- Got it.

09:08.516 --> 09:09.977
What's my favorite food?

09:10.102 --> 09:11.909
Trick question.
You have no taste buds.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.672
- What's my first pet's name?
- Monkey, the golden retriever.

09:15.038 --> 09:17.089
- My favorite movie?
- <i>Dude, Where's My</i>...

09:17.214 --> 09:18.773
We're doing this the wrong way.

09:18.898 --> 09:21.020
Perhaps I should tell you
all this stuff first.

09:22.372 --> 09:23.270
Do that.

09:26.292 --> 09:27.635
Mom, this is delicious.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.903
Too delicious.
This is fried in trans fat.

09:31.343 --> 09:33.439
- Mom, how could you...
- Don't you judge me.

09:33.564 --> 09:36.023
Do you know how hard it is
to cook for this family?

09:36.148 --> 09:38.469
Not very.
But I can't handle much.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.497
Steve, don't eat those.
Trans fats are illegal.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.609
Dad, are you breaking the law?

09:44.734 --> 09:47.852
Yes, son, but it's a stupid law.
It shouldn't exist to begin with.

09:47.977 --> 09:51.148
So, since the trans fat law is stupid,
we don't have to follow it?

09:51.273 --> 09:52.283
Smart boy.

09:52.408 --> 09:54.587
What can I buy you?
New baseball mitt, skateboard?

09:54.712 --> 09:56.401
- Can I have a bunny?
- To kill?

09:56.526 --> 09:58.085
No, to love.

09:58.369 --> 09:59.210
Geez.

09:59.731 --> 10:01.270
Dad, you're such a hypocrite.

10:01.395 --> 10:04.449
Besides that law is totally legit.
Trans fat can kill...

10:04.766 --> 10:06.698
Now am I supposed to get that?!

10:06.823 --> 10:09.027
It's too much!
It's all too much!

10:11.474 --> 10:13.122
Okay, Jer, see you in a few days.

10:13.247 --> 10:16.034
Sure thing, Stan. Let me know
if that lotto ticket's a winner.

10:16.159 --> 10:17.742
You'll be the first to hear, buddy.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.166
Well, after my boss when
I tell him to stick it.

10:24.293 --> 10:26.595
There goes the only man
I'll ever love.

10:36.868 --> 10:38.982
Evening, Officer.
What brings you here?

10:39.107 --> 10:41.199
Turlington, Internal Affairs.

10:41.324 --> 10:44.100
I've been assigned to watch the city
line and inspect for trans fats.

10:44.225 --> 10:45.470
That sounds pretty boring.

10:45.595 --> 10:47.488
What do you say you and me
go around the corner

10:47.613 --> 10:49.818
and make your job
a lot more exciting?

10:50.126 --> 10:52.572
I can tell by your lack
of interest that I was kidding.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.245
Pretty smart, aren't you?

10:55.158 --> 10:58.928
You wouldn't happen to be bringing any
trans fat across city lines, would you?

10:59.053 --> 11:01.297
'Cause I'd hate to see
your smart face on the crime beat.

11:01.422 --> 11:02.522
Crime beat?!

11:03.192 --> 11:05.872
Lovely day for a fast, short
backward drive, isn't it?

11:07.658 --> 11:09.241
What he's doing back there?

11:10.368 --> 11:14.086
Well, not my jurisdiction.
My jurisdiction lies this way.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.350
This quiet direction here.

11:19.268 --> 11:21.079
Well, that was just delightful.

11:21.204 --> 11:24.261
So, Officer, if you need to search
my car, feel free, because I've got...

11:24.386 --> 11:25.386
Oh, wait!

11:26.892 --> 11:27.978
... nothing to hide.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.326
Hello, all.

11:36.513 --> 11:38.470
Well, you have the smoking, down.

11:45.053 --> 11:47.147
- And the club foot.
- I have everything down.

11:47.272 --> 11:49.061
- Oh, do you?
- Indeed.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.875
- Favorite sausage?
- Weiswurst.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.899
- With?
- Sauerkraut.

11:53.024 --> 11:55.297
- Baseball player?
- Shonweiss.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.959
- Made-up word?
- Scheigelbarben.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.040
I have nothing left to teach you.
You are ready for the lawyers.

12:00.194 --> 12:02.180
Wait there is something else
you should know.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.747
I bedazzled my genitalia.

12:03.872 --> 12:07.307
Then we have a happy
coincidence going on here!

12:07.629 --> 12:08.643
Mine says "ABBA."

12:16.740 --> 12:18.653
Honey, what's the matter?
What is it?

12:21.056 --> 12:22.699
I'm pregnant, aren't I?

12:23.042 --> 12:25.389
That's it, isn't it?!
I'm pregnant!

12:26.124 --> 12:28.205
You told me I was on the pill!

12:28.534 --> 12:30.219
No, you're not pregnant, thank God.

12:30.344 --> 12:32.205
I wouldn't want to bring
a child into a world

12:32.330 --> 12:34.086
where I can't get
any more trans fat.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.585
- What?
- They're onto me.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.963
- I can't smuggle...
- Don't give me "can't".

12:38.088 --> 12:40.717
You're gonna have to try
harder or you're the one

12:40.886 --> 12:43.553
who's gonna tell this chick
it's not gonna be fried!

12:44.009 --> 12:47.264
You look into its sweet,
innocent face and say:

12:47.483 --> 12:48.688
"I'm sorry, Penny,

12:48.813 --> 12:51.645
"we're out of trans fat!
You won't be fried today!"

12:52.072 --> 12:54.994
Because I will not do it.

13:06.722 --> 13:10.655
- How'd you like to get that bunny?
- Would I? I already have a name for it,

13:10.885 --> 13:12.809
but I'm not ready to tell anybody.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.009
Whiskers.

13:14.491 --> 13:15.710
I'm mad at myself.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.190
All right, there's your trans fats.

13:18.315 --> 13:21.599
I'll see you next week.
And, you know, kiss your dad for me.

13:22.652 --> 13:23.943
Kiss him hard!

13:24.068 --> 13:26.026
Take the breath out of his lungs.

13:26.237 --> 13:28.223
I want him to have to sit down.

13:33.794 --> 13:35.328
Look innocent, smile,

13:35.453 --> 13:36.844
and tell him "hello"

13:36.969 --> 13:38.895
as if you've got nothing to hide.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.824
We did it, bike!

13:42.949 --> 13:46.338
I feel so good I'm going to ride
the next mile side-saddle.

13:51.711 --> 13:52.560
Well?

13:53.451 --> 13:55.801
My boy! Tonight we feast.

13:55.926 --> 13:58.553
- And this is for you, kiddo.
- A bunny!

13:58.678 --> 14:00.993
You've earned it.
You're a first-rate smuggler.

14:01.748 --> 14:03.508
What a cute little bunny!

14:04.075 --> 14:06.521
I'm gonna pop you
right in the fryer.

14:12.765 --> 14:14.843
Okay, here we are, Mrs. Washburn.

14:14.968 --> 14:16.524
Steve, I need my t-fats.

14:16.649 --> 14:19.270
Why are you wasting time helping
little old ladies across the street?

14:19.395 --> 14:22.289
Well, it's kind of page one
of the Scout Manual, Dad. And...

14:24.911 --> 14:27.472
Well played, son.
Way to mix it up.

14:28.506 --> 14:30.156
But what about me?

14:30.328 --> 14:32.675
You walked me clear
across the city line

14:32.800 --> 14:34.533
and 40 blocks more.

14:34.997 --> 14:37.568
I kept telling you,
"No, I live there!"

14:37.770 --> 14:39.428
I live back there!

14:39.553 --> 14:41.253
Not my problem, grandma.

14:44.272 --> 14:47.886
Time for 60 years of kegel exercises
to pay off.

14:55.619 --> 14:57.739
Gentlemen, my name is Klaus Heisler.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.205
Mr. Heisler.
We've been looking for you.

15:00.330 --> 15:03.565
Indeed. I was born to Peasants
in the quaint Hamlet of...

15:03.690 --> 15:05.823
Actually, we just need you
to sign this affidavit

15:05.948 --> 15:07.697
swearing that you are
who you say you are.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.361
Really? But I had to sit through
so many boring stories about my life.

15:13.232 --> 15:15.063
- Kill him.
- What's happening?

15:15.188 --> 15:17.123
We're gonna give you
what you have coming.

15:17.737 --> 15:20.106
Wait! Why are you
bearing down on me menacingly?

15:20.231 --> 15:21.652
I'm Klaus, I tell you.

15:22.954 --> 15:25.463
<i>Danke schön! Oktoberfest!</i> German!

15:25.588 --> 15:28.447
<i>Bye-bye, mein lieber Herr,
farewell mein lieber Herr,</i>

15:28.572 --> 15:31.429
<i>It was a fine affair,
but now it's over</i>

15:42.102 --> 15:43.327
Stupid law.

15:52.795 --> 15:55.287
Hello, officer.
What can I do you for?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.229
I've seen you come this way
an awful lot, lately.

15:58.354 --> 16:00.792
I always figured you to be
a trustworthy scout ranger.

16:01.370 --> 16:04.329
Then I noticed you weren't wearing
your helmet and I thought,

16:04.454 --> 16:06.588
"Maybe he's not so trustworthy."

16:07.039 --> 16:09.963
Right. I donated it
to "Helmets for Humanity."

16:10.259 --> 16:13.855
They give me helmets to landmine victims
in developing countries.

16:14.155 --> 16:17.396
My helmet's the only thing holding
a Cambodian boy's head together.

16:17.521 --> 16:18.996
What's in the basket?

16:19.826 --> 16:21.284
Sandwiches for the poor.

16:21.409 --> 16:23.845
How about you throw a turkey sandwich
and I'll turn the other way.*

16:23.970 --> 16:25.275
I'll pay you 4.25 for it.

16:28.132 --> 16:31.392
Good. I'll get my money
which I keep under the passenger seat.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.727
4.22...

16:47.852 --> 16:49.841
4.23...

17:00.356 --> 17:01.977
Will you take 4.23?

17:17.181 --> 17:18.953
Mama! If you can hear me,

17:19.354 --> 17:20.500
it's Daniel.

17:20.836 --> 17:22.911
I want that sandwich.

17:24.773 --> 17:25.773
A nickel.

17:28.449 --> 17:29.871
Sorry, just ran out.

17:30.444 --> 17:31.452
Mama?

17:31.577 --> 17:33.132
Mama, we were too late.

17:36.712 --> 17:38.890
What's with all these empty
trans fat cans?

17:40.051 --> 17:41.098
Recycling.

17:41.223 --> 17:44.615
Just pleasuring Mother Earth,
like a young boy should. Bye!

17:45.445 --> 17:48.608
Look where he's headed, Mama.
Right into my jurisdiction.

17:50.693 --> 17:52.175
This isn't home.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.704
My coordinates must be off.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.894
*
I gotta get this thing recalibrated.

18:05.097 --> 18:06.334
Ambush, huh?

18:06.935 --> 18:09.918
Now that I think about it,
there is one thing I left out.

18:10.043 --> 18:12.597
Back home,
I had a terrible gambling problem.

18:12.722 --> 18:14.899
Owed a fortune
to the East-German mafia.

18:15.671 --> 18:18.047
I guess they were trying
to smoke me out.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.932
Oh, my God, we fell for that one,
didn't we?

18:24.850 --> 18:27.377
Use your board.
Use your message board.

18:31.839 --> 18:34.638
"How cute is Daniel Day Lewis?"

18:35.289 --> 18:37.657
Good! The morphine
is finally kicking in.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.133
Dad! I got pulled over
at the city line,

18:46.258 --> 18:48.282
and then officer Turlington
followed me home.

18:48.407 --> 18:50.491
Steve, did he catch you with the...?

18:51.261 --> 18:53.606
I ate all the evidence
before he could find it.

18:53.878 --> 18:54.892
Attamule.

18:55.195 --> 18:57.704
I think I'm gonna go lie down.
I'm feeling a little sweaty.

18:57.829 --> 19:00.485
I wonder if it's connected
to all those cans of trans fat I ate.

19:00.610 --> 19:02.683
There's a shooting pain
in my left arm.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.196
And my chest hurts.

19:04.696 --> 19:05.937
That's so weird.

19:07.995 --> 19:08.797
Dad!

19:08.922 --> 19:10.567
I think I'm having a heart attack.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.597
Steve, we gotta get you
to the hospital.

19:13.429 --> 19:14.473
Don't do it.

19:14.598 --> 19:15.986
Turlington's on to us.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.833
We'll be found out and...

19:19.028 --> 19:20.241
shamed in the paper.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.476
But it's not too late.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.050
We can kill Turlington.

19:24.175 --> 19:26.607
Or firebomb the newspaper, or both!

19:26.732 --> 19:27.540
We can't.

19:27.999 --> 19:31.393
Why? 'Cause it's illegal to kill
a cop who's up in your business?

19:31.518 --> 19:34.525
But that's a stupid law.
And it's okay to break those, right?

19:37.400 --> 19:38.778
What have I done?

19:39.065 --> 19:41.713
I've turned my own son
into an amoral smuggler

19:41.838 --> 19:44.906
who believes you can pick and choose
which laws you follow.

19:47.005 --> 19:47.811
Dad!

19:48.155 --> 19:49.184
This is it.

19:51.681 --> 19:53.936
Steve, no! Don't go to the light!

19:54.181 --> 19:55.856
Go as close to the light as you can,

19:55.981 --> 19:58.837
and then ask my grand-father
why Jim Nabors was at his funeral.

19:58.962 --> 20:00.184
But then come back.

20:00.643 --> 20:01.944
Steve, can you hear me?

20:02.069 --> 20:05.243
Local crime beat be damned!
I'm taking you to the hospital.

20:05.591 --> 20:07.634
Unless of course
this kick revives you.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.561
- Dad?
- He's waking up.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.422
- What happened?
- Son, you're okay.

20:21.725 --> 20:23.840
Turns out you didn't have
a heart attack after all.

20:23.965 --> 20:26.601
Which in my opinion makes
all your dramatics on the kitchen floor

20:26.726 --> 20:29.083
a bit uncalled for, but whatever,
you thought what you thought.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.709
You have angina.

20:30.834 --> 20:34.825
Which, according to Dr. Natterson,
sounds like vagina.

20:35.430 --> 20:38.111
I don't know about that,
but he's the doctor.

20:38.675 --> 20:41.239
Dad, you...
You brought me to the hospital?

20:41.707 --> 20:42.989
Of course I did, son.

20:43.114 --> 20:45.159
Having you safe and sound
is all that matters.

20:45.637 --> 20:47.954
But that means your picture
is gonna be in the paper tomorrow.

20:48.327 --> 20:51.550
It was in the paper 6 weeks ago,
you've been in a medically-induced coma.

20:51.675 --> 20:53.892
I was shamed, I suffered,
and I moved on.

20:54.017 --> 20:56.438
And frankly, the family's recently been
far more concerned

20:56.563 --> 20:58.153
with Roger's runaway banana boat.

20:58.278 --> 21:00.300
It's been quite a story.
A little big, but funny.
