WEBVTT

00:00.346 --> 00:02.245
<i>Previously on
"Queen of the South"...</i>

00:02.281 --> 00:03.915
I want you to be part
of the business.

00:03.951 --> 00:06.584
- Would you die for me?
- I'll survive for you.

00:06.620 --> 00:08.653
What is this?
I never signed this paper.

00:08.689 --> 00:09.921
Camila's trying to set
you up to take the fall

00:09.957 --> 00:11.489
for her business.

00:11.525 --> 00:13.791
I'm leaving Camila.
Starting off on my own.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.293
Big britches you're
trying to fill, girl.

00:15.329 --> 00:16.794
I know the risks.

00:16.830 --> 00:17.996
<i>You tried
to set me up,</i>

00:18.032 --> 00:19.897
<i>but we can still make a deal.</i>

00:19.933 --> 00:22.603
The only deal that goes on here
will put you in the grave.

00:26.673 --> 00:29.007
<i>I picked you.
I housed you.</i>

00:29.043 --> 00:32.143
I protected you.
You kill Epifanio.

00:32.179 --> 00:36.314
<i>You're gonna watch
the love of your life die</i>

00:36.350 --> 00:38.684
<i>a slow and painful death.</i>

00:40.622 --> 00:42.153
Okay, he's not breathing.
Guero.

00:42.189 --> 00:44.256
You killed the man
that Teresa loved.

00:44.292 --> 00:46.858
I'm here for a truce.
Teresa's business is stalled.

00:46.894 --> 00:48.360
She needs my connection.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.861
She's not gonna want your help.

00:49.897 --> 00:52.364
She needs it.
And I certainly need hers.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.533
<i>It's the only way
to save my daughter.</i>

00:54.569 --> 00:56.768
I can set up the introduction
with the Colombians.

00:56.804 --> 00:58.170
What do you want in return?

00:58.206 --> 01:00.105
I want you to kill Cortez.

01:00.141 --> 01:02.174
You need more men.

01:02.210 --> 01:05.812
<i>That's why we contacted
Javier Jimenez, Boaz's cousin.</i>

01:09.051 --> 01:11.017
I'm rolling the dice on you,
Teresa.

01:11.053 --> 01:14.319
Together we can win.
We will run Phoenix.

01:14.355 --> 01:15.622
<i>We have a snitch.</i>

01:15.658 --> 01:17.790
You don't think... James?

01:17.826 --> 01:19.292
I found the mole.

01:19.328 --> 01:20.827
<i>I can't work
for someone</i>

01:20.863 --> 01:22.562
<i>who keeps questioning
my loyalty.</i>

01:22.598 --> 01:24.230
<i>Not after all
we've been through.</i>

01:24.266 --> 01:25.965
I wanna help you
take out Cortez

01:26.001 --> 01:29.202
and make sure you're secure,
but then I'm out.

01:29.238 --> 01:30.803
<i>They put a tracker
in Guero's necklace.</i>

01:30.839 --> 01:32.205
Can we use this?

01:32.241 --> 01:33.206
To track someone?
Absolutely.

01:33.242 --> 01:34.741
<i>Bueno?</i>

01:34.777 --> 01:36.576
<i>You have
something I want,</i>

01:36.612 --> 01:39.545
<i>and I have something you want.
Let's make a deal.</i>

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.580 --> 02:46.381
The shipment looks good.
200 kilos, as promised.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.819
50 are yours.

02:49.855 --> 02:52.888
That's twice what
we talked about.

02:52.924 --> 02:56.826
You got into this business
to help your tribe survive.

02:56.862 --> 02:59.762
If you agree to leave
in five years,

02:59.798 --> 03:02.131
I'll double your pay
until then.

03:06.004 --> 03:08.270
You have my word.

03:08.306 --> 03:10.107
But I wouldn't count
on the General's.

03:10.143 --> 03:12.408
And Cortez
is slippery as a snake.

03:12.444 --> 03:16.812
You have a deal with him now,
but odds are it won't last.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.748
You should take precautions.

03:29.796 --> 03:31.130
How are you?

03:33.132 --> 03:34.967
Things went smooth at the port.

03:37.069 --> 03:38.805
That's not what I meant.

03:41.407 --> 03:43.540
I buried Bilal at sea.

03:45.245 --> 03:48.045
That's what he
would have wanted.

03:48.081 --> 03:50.714
We both buried
family in this war.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.683
The ones we chose.

03:53.719 --> 03:58.055
- Feels harder.
- It does.

03:58.091 --> 04:00.858
Cortez needs to die.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.796
Y'all find him yet?

04:09.670 --> 04:11.636
<i>This is a long shot.</i>

04:11.672 --> 04:13.571
For all we know,
Cortez found the medallion

04:13.607 --> 04:15.540
the second he laid
eyes on Camila.

04:15.576 --> 04:18.476
She could be lying dead
in a ditch somewhere.

04:18.512 --> 04:20.878
My family wouldn't shed a tear,

04:20.914 --> 04:22.847
and neither would Teresa.

04:22.883 --> 04:25.184
Reynaldo Fieto would,
he's the new connect.

04:25.220 --> 04:28.053
So we need to keep
an eye on Camila

04:28.089 --> 04:30.354
and make sure she's alive.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.723
<i>Entiendes?</i>

04:33.127 --> 04:35.526
Eh, look at you
with the español.

04:37.966 --> 04:39.898
We're getting closer.

04:39.934 --> 04:42.701
If this works, we'll hit Cortez
before he knows what's coming.

05:04.059 --> 05:06.893
I don't know how you do it.

05:06.929 --> 05:11.363
Even in captivity,
you remain so very lovely.

05:11.399 --> 05:15.602
Even more lovely, perhaps.

05:32.155 --> 05:35.222
You made me pozole once.

05:35.258 --> 05:37.224
You told me we were family.

05:45.869 --> 05:49.770
Would you like to make pozole
for me again, Camila?

05:49.806 --> 05:52.106
I know you would give it
that perfect flavor.

05:58.448 --> 06:01.815
I know what you do to your
big times, like Batman.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.754
You don't scare me, Alberto.

06:09.026 --> 06:11.092
Brave words

06:11.128 --> 06:13.962
from a woman in captivity.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.864
I want to see my daughter.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.199
Bring her to me.

06:18.235 --> 06:22.003
You want to double
the ingredients?

06:22.039 --> 06:24.372
What a fine idea.

06:24.408 --> 06:26.141
I'll be happy to accommodate
your request.

06:45.496 --> 06:46.996
Hola, Teresa.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.066
<i>We just received
your delivery.</i>

06:50.102 --> 06:51.801
I take it all was in order.

06:51.837 --> 06:53.736
Yes, it was.

06:53.772 --> 06:58.040
George will oversee
the transport through Mexico.

06:58.076 --> 07:00.543
I'm glad to hear our prisoner
exchange has worked out

07:00.579 --> 07:02.478
as well for you
as it has for me.

07:02.514 --> 07:05.815
I guaranteed the Colombians
Camila's safety.

07:05.851 --> 07:10.087
If something happens to her,
we both lose our product.

07:10.123 --> 07:12.822
Camila is exactly
where she should be.

07:12.858 --> 07:14.690
Reynaldo has nothing to fear.

07:18.931 --> 07:21.697
Heads up.
We got trouble.

07:24.303 --> 07:25.601
Shit.

07:29.308 --> 07:31.408
Damn it!

07:34.914 --> 07:36.747
We're surrounded.

07:36.783 --> 07:38.385
There's no
way out of this.

07:39.755 --> 07:44.755
Subtitles by explosiveskull

07:53.077 --> 07:56.111
- You know her?
- No.

07:56.147 --> 07:58.413
If it was a ambush they would
have already hit us by now.

07:58.449 --> 08:02.117
If we run, they will follow.

08:02.153 --> 08:03.852
We need to do this.

08:03.888 --> 08:05.553
We'll cover you.

08:19.171 --> 08:21.270
I'm Castel Fieto.

08:21.306 --> 08:23.605
You made a deal with my uncle,
but not with me.

08:23.641 --> 08:25.941
Is el Reynaldo in charge
of your family?

08:25.977 --> 08:27.846
He is.
For now.

08:31.683 --> 08:33.616
Hey.

08:33.652 --> 08:36.318
Let me be frank with you,
Teresa.

08:36.354 --> 08:37.886
It's okay.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.587
Camila and Reynaldo
are dinosaurs,

08:39.624 --> 08:41.157
the way they run
their business.

08:41.193 --> 08:44.159
I have connections
in government.

08:44.196 --> 08:45.828
With politicians.

08:45.864 --> 08:48.931
Investments far beyond
the realm of cocaine.

08:48.967 --> 08:52.302
Your innovations with
product and distribution,

08:52.338 --> 08:53.636
cryptocurrency...

08:53.672 --> 08:55.272
You know a lot
about my business.

08:55.308 --> 08:58.241
Like I said,
I have connections.

08:58.277 --> 09:00.510
And that's my point.

09:00.546 --> 09:02.813
Camila and Reynaldo,
they...

09:02.849 --> 09:04.915
They don't know technology
like we do.

09:04.951 --> 09:08.985
They're the past,
and you and I,

09:09.021 --> 09:11.522
we're the future.

09:11.558 --> 09:14.291
You didn't come all the way
from Bogotá to praise me.

09:16.195 --> 09:19.129
You struck
a dangerous deal.

09:19.165 --> 09:21.031
The only true way
to power is violence.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.334
And Cortez,
he won't hesitate to use it.

09:23.370 --> 09:26.937
He delights in it,
like a child with a plaything.

09:26.973 --> 09:30.975
He knows what's at stake.
He won't hurt Camila.

09:31.011 --> 09:33.010
But he will harm you.

09:33.046 --> 09:35.213
Look how easily I got to you.

09:35.249 --> 09:37.548
My spies inside the General's
organization say

09:37.584 --> 09:39.484
he's already planning it.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.786
A strike against you
is imminent.

09:53.601 --> 09:57.569
There he is.
The tracker worked.

09:57.605 --> 10:00.239
I say we
raid the place.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.840
Knock those stars right
off the General's shoulder.

10:02.876 --> 10:06.281
Along with his pinche cabeza.

10:07.415 --> 10:10.415
I had a run-in
with Cortez once.

10:10.451 --> 10:12.584
His time will come.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.756
But we wait
for Teresa's orders.

10:21.062 --> 10:24.132
There's Isabela.
Camila's here.

10:42.151 --> 10:44.884
Are you okay?

10:44.920 --> 10:45.952
Did he hurt you?

10:45.988 --> 10:47.687
No.

10:47.723 --> 10:49.956
But you did.

10:49.992 --> 10:51.625
I did not order Kique's death.

10:51.661 --> 10:53.359
You have to believe me,
Isabela.

10:56.298 --> 10:58.965
I don't care
if I die right now.

10:59.001 --> 11:01.535
As long as you understand that.

11:01.571 --> 11:04.103
I know I hurt you.

11:04.139 --> 11:06.440
I just wish you
could forgive me.

11:06.476 --> 11:09.976
Careful what
you wish for, Camila.

11:10.012 --> 11:14.281
Even if your daughter
does forgive you,

11:14.317 --> 11:16.884
doesn't mean that justice
is served for Kique.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.552
Isabela...

11:24.794 --> 11:26.227
No.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.298
An eye for an eye.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.967
Look at me.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.936
- The Bible says...
- Don't listen to him.

11:35.972 --> 11:39.006
What do you think
God would want in exchange

11:39.042 --> 11:42.743
for the life of the man
your daughter loved?

11:42.779 --> 11:45.846
Don't listen to him, Isabela.
Look at me.

11:45.882 --> 11:49.484
Now is the time for vengeance.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.186
He lied.

11:51.222 --> 11:54.322
Because of her,
you have no father.

11:54.358 --> 11:56.191
No husband.

11:58.396 --> 12:00.929
She's given you
nothing but pain.

12:00.965 --> 12:02.464
Don't listen to him.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.000
On your knees.

12:06.904 --> 12:08.270
Now.

12:22.187 --> 12:24.720
You have to pay
for what you did to Kique.

12:28.093 --> 12:30.226
I don't believe you.

12:45.844 --> 12:48.077
How truly disappointing.

12:51.049 --> 12:53.883
- You failed me, Isa!
- Let her go.

12:58.191 --> 13:01.525
This is between us, Alberto.

13:05.131 --> 13:08.598
I tried to protect you both.

13:08.634 --> 13:12.537
I had so many plans for us.

13:12.573 --> 13:16.607
For a single moment
I just felt like

13:16.643 --> 13:18.609
we would be a family.

13:18.645 --> 13:19.843
But...

13:24.218 --> 13:25.616
She made her choice.

13:30.724 --> 13:33.291
Like mother,
like daughter.

13:33.327 --> 13:36.194
You will have
to kill me first.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.729
Fine.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.400
Reynaldo will blame you.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.625
I'm so sorry.

14:06.661 --> 14:07.993
It's okay.

14:08.029 --> 14:09.161
He made me
believe that.

14:09.197 --> 14:11.897
- I know.
- And he gave me the gun.

14:29.217 --> 14:30.853
I'll go check on the load.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.299
We're gonna need more soldiers.

14:46.335 --> 14:51.705
If Cortez makes his move,
like la Colombiana said,

14:51.741 --> 14:54.140
we've gotta be ready.

14:54.176 --> 14:57.845
What?
You don't believe her?

14:57.881 --> 14:59.946
I do.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.085
What I don't understand
is why she would warn me.

15:04.855 --> 15:06.620
She needs you in Phoenix.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.658
She wants something else.

15:10.227 --> 15:11.862
Yo, principessa.

15:13.563 --> 15:14.895
We got a problem.

15:20.604 --> 15:24.806
Don't tell me.
Cortez tried to short us.

15:26.711 --> 15:30.211
It ain't under.
It's over.

15:30.247 --> 15:33.414
- Nine kilos.
- Nine kilos?

15:33.450 --> 15:36.083
- You sure?
- Yep.

15:36.119 --> 15:38.487
No one goes over that much.

15:40.725 --> 15:43.023
Pote, move away.
Everybody move away now!

15:43.059 --> 15:44.392
Go!

15:54.052 --> 15:56.181
They're celebrating.

15:56.217 --> 15:58.283
Maybe Cortez took out
Camila and her daughter.

15:59.955 --> 16:03.622
No, he wouldn't ruin his
deal with the Colombians.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.625
It's gotta be something else.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.298
You're gonna
be all right.

16:15.404 --> 16:18.271
Pote, that shit
was too on the money.

16:18.307 --> 16:20.440
Someone's
got a detonator.

16:20.476 --> 16:22.041
Get him in.

16:22.077 --> 16:23.810
Teresa all right?

16:35.491 --> 16:37.925
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

16:37.961 --> 16:40.596
Cortez hid a bomb
in the shipment.

16:41.998 --> 16:43.764
- Is anyone hurt?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:43.800 --> 16:45.165
<i>There were
a few injuries.</i>

16:45.201 --> 16:47.266
George took them to the clinic.

16:47.302 --> 16:49.235
We need to attack
Cortez right now.

16:49.271 --> 16:50.437
We don't have any
more time to wait.

16:50.473 --> 16:52.306
Go now.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.141
Tell your men to gear up.

16:59.849 --> 17:00.981
<i>Bueno.</i>

17:31.148 --> 17:33.848
After the distraction,
I'm gonna take two soldiers

17:33.884 --> 17:35.517
and breach
the southern perimeter.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.357
What are you planning
for a distraction?

17:42.393 --> 17:44.827
Well, Cortez sent
a Trojan horse.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.195
So he's gonna get one
in return.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.491
Come on, here we go!

19:05.646 --> 19:07.080
Let's go.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.697
- What is it?
- It's right out there.

19:26.167 --> 19:29.101
Go!

19:52.794 --> 19:54.360
You led Teresa's people here.

19:54.396 --> 19:56.262
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:56.298 --> 19:57.498
No?

20:13.048 --> 20:15.448
A GPS tracker?

20:15.484 --> 20:18.484
You think you're so smart.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.322
You and Teresa
working together.

20:25.861 --> 20:29.796
There'll be a reckoning
when this is all over.

20:29.832 --> 20:31.664
I assure you.

20:48.251 --> 20:51.251
- I think we lost him.
- Then we find him.

20:51.287 --> 20:55.022
We cannot let him go.
He'll come back and finish us.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.039
Go, go!

21:27.725 --> 21:29.224
Hey, we gotta move.
We don't have time.

21:33.931 --> 21:35.530
Here.

22:04.796 --> 22:05.828
Go!

22:11.937 --> 22:13.636
We gotta move.

22:13.672 --> 22:15.238
On three I'm gonna fire
and you're gonna run.

22:15.274 --> 22:16.239
- Ready?
- Okay.

22:16.275 --> 22:18.141
One, two, go!

22:21.814 --> 22:24.181
<i>Pinche cabron</i> is starting
to piss me off.

22:28.988 --> 22:29.953
Go!

23:32.053 --> 23:34.019
Let's finish this.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.206
Teresa!

24:07.423 --> 24:08.692
Where is he?

24:08.757 --> 24:09.923
He's dead.

24:09.959 --> 24:11.791
Yeah?

24:11.827 --> 24:12.959
We're on the way
back to Phoenix now.

24:12.995 --> 24:14.294
We've got Cortez.

24:14.330 --> 24:15.428
<i>Bad news, though.</i>

24:15.464 --> 24:16.430
<i>The soldiers moved Camila</i>

24:16.466 --> 24:18.167
<i>before we could get her.</i>

25:11.493 --> 25:14.093
She has arrived.

25:14.129 --> 25:17.697
Ready to collect
your pound of flesh?

25:17.733 --> 25:20.933
Let's not make this harder
than it has to be.

25:20.969 --> 25:23.168
Call your men.

25:23.204 --> 25:26.306
And tell them to bring Camila.

25:26.342 --> 25:29.008
You think I'm a fool?

25:29.044 --> 25:31.211
I know I'm already dead.

25:31.247 --> 25:32.945
You're right.

25:32.981 --> 25:34.681
You're not leaving here alive,

25:34.717 --> 25:37.984
but how you die is up to you.

25:39.422 --> 25:41.621
Are you offering mercy?

25:41.657 --> 25:43.056
I'm offering you a bullet.

25:43.092 --> 25:44.658
You know the alternative.

25:49.666 --> 25:53.800
You live by the sword,
die by the sword.

25:53.836 --> 25:56.870
I knew
this day was coming.

25:56.906 --> 25:59.707
As for Camila,

25:59.743 --> 26:02.243
you don't have to worry
about finding her.

26:02.279 --> 26:06.046
She'll find you.

26:06.082 --> 26:07.548
I hope so.

26:24.301 --> 26:25.866
He's gonna help you
cross the border

26:25.902 --> 26:27.902
and keep you safe
until I can come get you.

26:27.938 --> 26:29.403
I don't wanna
leave without you.

26:29.439 --> 26:31.872
- Isabela...
- Now's our chance.

26:31.908 --> 26:35.209
We can escape all this.
Never look back.

26:35.245 --> 26:39.715
As long as Teresa is alive,
we're always gonna have to be

26:39.751 --> 26:42.617
looking over our shoulder.

26:42.653 --> 26:45.920
I need to end this now.
Once and for all.

26:45.956 --> 26:49.057
Then I'll stay until it's over.

26:49.093 --> 26:50.428
No, you won't.

26:52.096 --> 26:54.262
Isabela, listen to me.

26:54.298 --> 26:56.598
I love you very much.

26:56.634 --> 26:59.237
This is the one chance
I have to do things right.

27:00.238 --> 27:04.139
Please, don't take
that away from me.

27:09.914 --> 27:11.213
Go.

27:35.274 --> 27:37.240
How are you, <i>muñequita?</i>

27:37.276 --> 27:39.777
<i>Much better
now that we're safe.</i>

27:39.813 --> 27:43.079
Cortez did the wise thing
by calling us when he did.

27:43.115 --> 27:44.515
He protected you.

27:44.551 --> 27:46.850
Cortez was just
protecting his business.

27:46.886 --> 27:51.121
If it was up to him,
Isabela and I would be dead.

27:51.157 --> 27:53.357
<i>Nevertheless,
you're safe now.</i>

27:53.393 --> 27:55.159
<i>Castel is on her way,
and with the men</i>

27:55.195 --> 27:56.360
<i>that I sent you,</i>

27:56.396 --> 27:58.162
you can kill Teresa.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.330
<i>And we can be
done with this</i> pendejada

28:00.366 --> 28:03.000
<i>once and for all.</i>

28:09.409 --> 28:11.308
He looks tenderized
enough for you?

28:11.344 --> 28:13.379
Not quite.

28:15.483 --> 28:17.549
Everything's better with
a little more Tapatío.

28:21.988 --> 28:25.657
Last chance, <i>pendejo.</i>

28:25.693 --> 28:27.625
Where's Camila?

28:31.332 --> 28:33.298
Seems you got
a problem, General.

28:35.736 --> 28:38.670
If I remember correctly,
isn't that what you said

28:38.706 --> 28:40.638
Bilal had?

28:40.674 --> 28:43.208
You helped him out
with a little procedure.

28:43.244 --> 28:46.411
Now it seems like maybe
you could benefit

28:46.447 --> 28:48.747
from the very same thing.

28:48.783 --> 28:53.886
Only, uh, I'm gonna use
a different scalpel.

28:57.759 --> 29:00.992
You raped and pillaged
your way to the top.

29:01.028 --> 29:05.097
You enjoyed feasting
on the hearts of your enemies.

29:05.133 --> 29:11.570
And now I...
we're gonna take yours.

29:13.608 --> 29:15.174
See you in hell, <i>pendejo.</i>

29:20.917 --> 29:22.716
I'll bring the tortillas.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.095
Hello?

29:35.131 --> 29:37.264
<i>You survived
Cortez's strike.</i>

29:37.300 --> 29:39.199
<i>I assume the General
wasn't as lucky.</i>

29:39.235 --> 29:40.767
He was not.

29:40.803 --> 29:42.736
<i>Now you control
the Phoenix corridor</i>

29:42.772 --> 29:44.604
<i>all the way down to Sinaloa.</i>

29:44.640 --> 29:47.140
Smuggling and distribution.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.109
<i>You have my support,
Teresa.</i>

29:49.145 --> 29:51.411
<i>There's just one more thing
that needs to be settled.</i>

29:51.447 --> 29:52.613
Camila.

29:52.649 --> 29:54.882
She isn't far from Phoenix.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.250
Send me your address
so I can make arrangements.

29:57.286 --> 29:59.720
I thought your uncle
wanted to protect her.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.490
<i>My uncle and I don't
always agree on everything.</i>

30:02.526 --> 30:04.157
<i>Camila's one of them.</i>

30:04.193 --> 30:06.296
I'm betting on you, Teresa.

30:09.666 --> 30:10.731
Giving us Camila

30:10.767 --> 30:12.133
against her uncle's wishes.

30:12.169 --> 30:14.135
Sounds like a setup to me.

30:14.171 --> 30:16.070
I say we jump in
a <i>pinche</i> plane

30:16.106 --> 30:18.573
and get the hell
out of here.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.341
We have to do this.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.869
Time to settle accounts

30:47.905 --> 30:49.507
once and for all.

31:06.825 --> 31:08.391
Just say the word

31:08.427 --> 31:09.726
and I'll put
a bullet in her head.

31:09.762 --> 31:11.327
Easy, <i>gordo.</i>

31:21.407 --> 31:23.306
What about your uncle?

31:25.678 --> 31:27.811
As far as he
and Camila know,

31:27.847 --> 31:30.080
she was being taken
to a safe house.

31:30.116 --> 31:32.548
I'll handle him.
Finish it.

31:57.762 --> 32:00.563
- You brought this on yourself.
- Do it.

32:02.634 --> 32:05.869
We would have ended up
in the same place, you know.

32:05.905 --> 32:07.838
There can only
be one queen.

32:07.874 --> 32:10.106
You think I'm competing
with you?

32:12.645 --> 32:15.212
You've never known me
or understood who I am.

32:15.248 --> 32:18.849
You tell yourself that.
I know the truth.

32:18.885 --> 32:22.686
I knew it from the first
time I took you in.

32:22.722 --> 32:24.588
I can see it in your eyes.

32:24.624 --> 32:27.291
You're a wolf,
just like me.

32:27.327 --> 32:29.227
I am nothing like you.

32:29.263 --> 32:33.797
Oh, you don't see it now.
But you will in time.

32:33.833 --> 32:35.933
And then
you'll understand

32:35.969 --> 32:37.969
why I did what I did.

32:38.005 --> 32:39.636
And you'll thank me.

32:39.672 --> 32:42.073
Thank you?

32:42.109 --> 32:46.811
Your ego is blind to all
the pain you have caused.

32:46.847 --> 32:50.114
Even with a gun in my hand,

32:50.150 --> 32:53.383
with every reason to kill you,

32:53.419 --> 32:57.088
your arrogance still makes you
believe that you matter.

32:58.825 --> 33:01.158
I allow you to become what
you always wanted to be.

33:01.194 --> 33:04.462
You allow me?
Who are you to allow me?

33:04.498 --> 33:06.764
Teresa...

33:06.800 --> 33:10.269
- You're my greatest legacy.
- You are crazy.

33:21.983 --> 33:24.149
You're gonna live
the rest of your life

33:24.185 --> 33:26.752
as a fugitive
from your own country.

33:28.356 --> 33:31.456
- I'm sending you into exile.
- Kill me now.

33:33.294 --> 33:34.927
Or this won't be
the last time you see me...

33:34.963 --> 33:37.095
It will

33:37.131 --> 33:40.366
if you want
Isabela to live.

33:40.402 --> 33:44.103
Castel has her and is
keeping her safe for now.

33:44.139 --> 33:47.472
You already destroyed her life.

33:47.508 --> 33:49.375
You killed her innocence.

33:52.147 --> 33:53.880
Try to make a move against me.

33:56.318 --> 33:57.717
You know what will
happen to her.

34:35.692 --> 34:37.224
You eat people.
I heard this.

34:37.260 --> 34:40.428
There she is.

34:40.464 --> 34:43.197
Cortez is gone

34:43.233 --> 34:45.498
and you have a deal
with the Colombians.

34:48.205 --> 34:49.670
<i>Gracias.</i>

34:49.706 --> 34:52.373
48 hours ago,
we didn't have a supplier.

34:52.409 --> 34:54.909
Now we own the corridor
all the way from Sinaloa

34:54.945 --> 34:57.578
down to Phoenix.

34:57.614 --> 34:58.947
<i>Salud.</i>

34:58.983 --> 35:02.884
all: <i>Salud.</i>

35:05.890 --> 35:09.190
Can I have a word with you?

35:09.226 --> 35:11.526
What is it?

35:11.562 --> 35:13.396
Not here.

35:13.432 --> 35:18.270
all:

35:20.838 --> 35:23.105
Look, I have to go.
You don't need me anymore.

35:23.141 --> 35:25.307
You have that army.

35:25.343 --> 35:27.742
I'm sorry.

35:27.778 --> 35:29.211
Don't be.

35:29.247 --> 35:30.612
It's been a hell of a ride.

35:30.648 --> 35:32.616
This is where I get off.

35:34.519 --> 35:35.921
Your mind's made up?

35:37.022 --> 35:38.553
Yeah.

35:41.993 --> 35:43.325
I'm gonna miss you.

35:58.277 --> 36:00.477
I'll see you around.

36:00.513 --> 36:01.844
Take care of yourself.

36:04.050 --> 36:05.115
You, too.

36:24.155 --> 36:26.024
You're leaving us,
aren't you?

36:32.897 --> 36:34.830
Gonna miss you, <i>cabron.</i>

36:36.302 --> 36:38.434
Hey, you take care of her.

36:40.339 --> 36:41.604
Always.

36:48.547 --> 36:50.613
There he goes.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.782
The second best shot in Mexico.

36:56.188 --> 36:57.387
He's a good soldier.

36:59.492 --> 37:00.790
He'll be hard to replace.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.996
You know anyone
who might be interested?

37:10.903 --> 37:12.902
I might know a guy.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.907
He's not cheap.

37:42.737 --> 37:45.069
Teresa must really
be something special.

37:45.105 --> 37:48.039
I was half expecting you
to run after my call.

37:48.075 --> 37:50.311
I told her it was
my decision to leave.

37:51.545 --> 37:53.778
I know you can't run
from the CIA.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.851
How long have you known?

37:55.916 --> 37:57.549
The tracker you put
on Teresa's medallion,

37:57.585 --> 37:59.184
the hit on El Santo.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.721
One thing I can't figure out
is your connection

38:01.757 --> 38:03.922
with the Colombians.

38:03.958 --> 38:06.692
Castel, she work
for the agency?

38:06.728 --> 38:08.461
She's an asset.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.798
So that's why you
were hunting El Santo.

38:12.834 --> 38:15.267
To take out the competition
for the Colombians.

38:15.303 --> 38:16.968
She's a friend
of the agency.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.572
El Santo wasn't.

38:19.608 --> 38:21.273
Killing him served
both our purposes.

38:21.309 --> 38:23.109
And Teresa?

38:23.145 --> 38:26.545
Teresa will be safe
as long as she's useful to us.

38:26.581 --> 38:29.281
You, on the other hand,
you're a liability.

38:29.317 --> 38:32.753
That mess you made in Texas,

38:32.789 --> 38:34.420
this is how we clean it up.

38:34.456 --> 38:36.590
You come with us
so you won't be able

38:36.626 --> 38:38.090
to drag her down with you.

40:21.065 --> 40:24.099
- No, <i>gracias.</i>
- Take the pillow.

40:24.135 --> 40:25.935
It's gonna be a long flight.

40:28.407 --> 40:32.174
Mmm.

40:40.486 --> 40:43.553
You say we have a long flight?

40:43.589 --> 40:45.755
Where are we going?

40:45.791 --> 40:47.223
You'll see.
