00:02.125 --> 00:04.459
I got it! I got it!
It is for me.

00:05.167 --> 00:05.751
Hello?

00:06.584 --> 00:07.375
Hey, Harvey!

00:08.334 --> 00:09.751
Of course, question!

00:10.083 --> 00:12.083
Oh .. wait ... second.

00:13.459 --> 00:16.542
- Zelda Aunt, do you?
- Oh no, you are comfortable.

00:16.626 --> 00:18.751
No, I meant,
if you leave me alone?

00:20.001 --> 00:22.334
I get it.
Sorry.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.459
You were saying?

00:26.042 --> 00:27.292
More second.

00:27.292 --> 00:28.876
Salem, are you spying on me?

00:28.876 --> 00:32.375
I am a cat. I'm curious.
So kill me.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.042
Out!

00:34.042 --> 00:36.918
Okay. I understand
the delicacy of the moment.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.834
Harvey and Sabrina!
Harvey and Sabrina!

00:42.334 --> 00:43.584
Were going to ask?

00:44.459 --> 00:47.751
No, said the Sr.Pool
photosynthesis, do not leave the test.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.375
That's all?

00:50.501 --> 00:53.167
Okay ... ya,
until tomorrow.

00:55.209 --> 00:58.292
There, there. I am sure that the
Harvey will invite you to come out sometime!

00:58.375 --> 00:59.584
Thank you, Louisa.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.209
Were you listening?
I have no privacy in this house!

01:04.792 --> 01:07.083
Harvey and Sabrina!

01:24.918 --> 01:27.250
I'm ready to party.

01:30.626 --> 01:33.709
Just do not understand how people
will dance with these tables here!

01:33.709 --> 01:36.542
Sasha, let's take the tables.

01:37.042 --> 01:39.250
It seems that I go to the party.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.667
- With whom?!
- Me!

01:40.918 --> 01:44.001
The meetings is the way of
company control people.

01:44.001 --> 01:46.292
I will represent
the opposite.

01:46.292 --> 01:48.792
And I am sure it will be
that people will see.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.250
Want to come with me?
We can come alone, the two.

01:51.292 --> 01:52.292
No thanks.

01:52.292 --> 01:54.334
I was thinking it would be
fun to go with Harvey.

01:54.459 --> 01:55.626
You will invite him?

01:55.626 --> 01:58.125
Oh, I can not, I do not want
complicate our friendship.

01:58.334 --> 02:00.167
And if you invite him?

02:00.375 --> 02:02.876
Oh, I do not care if he
complicate our friendship.

02:03.709 --> 02:05.375
Hey Harvey, we're here.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.584
Thanks, would never notice that
sat at the table ever.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.959
So, you already have plans
the party tomorrow night?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.334
Oops, gotta go!

02:16.001 --> 02:18.250
I never saw her moving around so fast.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.542
Las to say about the party!?

02:20.542 --> 02:23.417
Probably will not.
School dances are not my type.

02:23.584 --> 02:24.792
And you?

02:24.792 --> 02:27.375
I did not make plans.
I mean, still.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.375
Hello Harvey, I can steal you a finger?

02:30.751 --> 02:31.792
Bright.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.834
Excuse me, we are talking about.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.626
There are more people with fingers,
know?

02:35.626 --> 02:38.542
Yes but Harvey are strong.
By the way, Harvey,

02:38.542 --> 02:41.834
I was thinking we could
go together to the party, okay?

02:42.209 --> 02:43.209
Okay.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.501
Great.
Thanks for the help.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.459
Okay? I thought
the balls were not your type?

02:51.542 --> 02:53.792
And there are
panic.

02:53.792 --> 02:58.083
I have difficulty saying no.
I think I have to work on it. No.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.792
Aunt Zelda, I need help.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.000
Of course, for what?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.417
Well it's a little private.

03:09.417 --> 03:10.792
Someone said private?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes

03:12.209 --> 03:14.083
I'm intrigued, continues.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.876
Okay, I'll be
promise to keep secret.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.918
Well, I go to party
tonight with this guy.

03:20.918 --> 03:21.918
Harvey.

03:22.501 --> 03:25.125
Sure.
But it goes with another girl.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.125
Libby.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.542
Okay, and what I do now?

03:27.542 --> 03:30.417
Oh dear, if you like Harvey
Libby's is his choice.

03:30.417 --> 03:33.083
But I do not think like.
I mean, was she who invited him ...

03:33.083 --> 03:35.375
and how he has difficulty
to say that we accepted.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.125
So why do not you invited?

03:37.125 --> 03:39.167
Because he would find out
I like it.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.501
But you like.

03:40.501 --> 03:42.083
Yes, but I can not tell.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.584
At least you understand this?

03:44.751 --> 03:48.834
Well, I smile a lot and it sometimes
when we play table football, let him win.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.918
He thus will never see.

03:51.918 --> 03:54.083
Teenage boys
very distracted

03:54.083 --> 03:56.334
If you like Harvey,
you have to tell you.

03:56.334 --> 03:58.375
Maybe you can even believe use of these.

04:01.292 --> 04:02.375
A hammer?

04:03.167 --> 04:05.083
Look, I think I prefer
a spell of love,

04:05.083 --> 04:07.042
but can not find anything
in my book of magic.

04:07.042 --> 04:10.626
Oh Sabrina, I am sorry to disappoint you
but there is no love spells.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.042
Love is more precious to move.

04:13.042 --> 04:15.959
Tell me, too strange, so
there is no standard formula,

04:15.959 --> 04:19.250
although Calvin Kline arrived
very closely with the "Obsession"

04:21.041 --> 04:23.042
So, being a witch did not help at all?

04:23.542 --> 04:25.417
Well, in this case, no.

04:25.667 --> 04:26.709
not necessarily.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.459
You can not make someone like you,

04:28.459 --> 04:32.375
but you can imprison him in a ring
not like you. See?

04:32.792 --> 04:35.876
Hilda, let me out.
Your love is growing on me.

04:36.918 --> 04:38.959
I love the way the light shines through.

04:39.209 --> 04:42.751
Look, hold Harvey in amber, not
is exactly what I have in mind.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.167
I think I need
to be alone again.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.918
Ah, the thing of privacy?

04:47.918 --> 04:51.334
Hilda, come on. We
down there if you need.

04:51.375 --> 04:55.209
True. We are here,
we worry and we have pie.

04:56.751 --> 04:58.250
This disgusts.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.334
With Harvey or without it
she should go to the ball ... I say party.

05:03.001 --> 05:06.876
The Sabrina needs someone modern and
fun, that makes it forget Harvey.

05:06.876 --> 05:09.959
I know we still have
Massa-Man here at home?

05:09.959 --> 05:12.250
Great idea.
A race to the kitchen.

05:17.501 --> 05:18.542
I got you!

05:19.334 --> 05:20.959
You are so immature.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.876
Care?
I'm busy contemplating the air.

05:23.876 --> 05:27.751
You can do that later. Let's
Sabrina had a date of your dreams.

05:27.751 --> 05:30.167
Oh, ooh, ooh, my food!

05:32.125 --> 05:33.167
Meeting dream.

05:39.751 --> 05:41.250
The nose is already!

05:44.042 --> 05:45.292
Get ears.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

06:00.876 --> 06:01.959
Ready.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.751
Wait a minute, one arm
is shorter than the other.

06:04.751 --> 06:06.334
Hilda, you had to eat pasta?

06:06.542 --> 06:07.542
No.

06:09.876 --> 06:12.959
- Now for the personality.
- Let's put.

06:13.042 --> 06:14.459
Let's make it a great dancer.

06:14.459 --> 06:15.626
And bold.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.834
And musician.

06:17.042 --> 06:18.876
Girls like musicians?

06:18.876 --> 06:21.042
Ever since the concert
"Feel the heat" of Mozart.

06:21.584 --> 06:25.626
- Oh! Exaggerated enthusiasm.
- He goes to a school dance,

06:25.626 --> 06:27.834
will need the maximum
enthusiasm as you can.

06:36.542 --> 06:40.417
What are you cooking?
I smell something ... good?

06:40.417 --> 06:41.709
Sabrina, you'll love.

06:41.709 --> 06:44.709
You will have a meeting of dream
done with mass-man.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.292
Mass-Man?

06:46.876 --> 06:48.751
He will be high,
mysterious and energetic.

06:48.751 --> 06:52.292
He is ready within 4 hours
which is perfect for your party.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.125
Yeah, perfect,

06:54.125 --> 06:57.167
except that they want to go with
Harvey, and not the human mass.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.834
Wait, knows the first
before you change your mind.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.667
You'll like it
he is truly enthusiastic.

07:03.876 --> 07:06.125
I have decided,
I will not.

07:11.334 --> 07:12.834
Man ready!

07:15.334 --> 07:18.751
Hey. Man, I'm so
happy to be here.

07:18.751 --> 07:20.584
Wow It is really enjoyable.

07:20.584 --> 07:23.876
Yeah, but as you
do not want to go to the party ...

07:23.876 --> 07:26.334
I changed my mind, I will.
give me a second to change me.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.375
There.
We have to go.

07:29.626 --> 07:33.042
My, you are amazing!
And this party seems to be high!

07:35.459 --> 07:38.709
Oh my, this place is fantastic!

07:39.501 --> 07:40.792
Your name?

07:40.876 --> 07:43.083
- The dining hall.
- The dining hall, the dining room!

07:43.125 --> 07:46.834
I have to remember that.
Wow, what a cool decor!

07:46.834 --> 07:49.125
Hey, you can keep it down?
You're talking too loud.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.292
- Hello
- Hello

07:50.501 --> 07:52.125
Hello
Who are you?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.918
I'm Jenny.
And you?

07:55.709 --> 07:58.083
<this is Chad ... Cory ... Dillan.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.667
- Great name.
- Thank you.

08:01.417 --> 08:03.667
Chad, you can bring
something to drink?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.501
She has bright ideas.

08:08.459 --> 08:09.876
What do you think?

08:09.876 --> 08:11.292
It's nice.
Where did you meet?

08:11.292 --> 08:15.542
My aunt showed us.
We came on the bike it.

08:16.209 --> 08:17.626
Approved.

08:17.667 --> 08:21.626
Ya Chad is perfect for an athlete,
bold and rock musician.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.501
Guess? They have 2 flavors,
orange and currant.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.876
Take it easy.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.459
Well, I'll dance.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.542
Wait a second.
We can dance here?

08:34.751 --> 08:35.918
Yes, you like to dance?

08:36.125 --> 08:39.417
I was made for dancing
and I love this song.

08:39.626 --> 08:42.292
Sorry, take it. Thank you,
thanks. Thank you indeed.

08:48.209 --> 08:50.209
Sasha, I missed something?

08:50.417 --> 08:51.834
Not much.
Where have you had?

08:52.042 --> 08:54.459
We had a problem with the engine
the Vette on the way here.

08:54.918 --> 08:57.918
- You drive a Corvette?
- Is "Shove ... ette.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.250
Hey! It's the same thing.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.250
Oh, please!

09:02.876 --> 09:05.709
Oh my God!
What is the type that is with Sabrina?

09:07.083 --> 09:11.584
His name is Chad and Cory Dillan yes
it is the bike that is out there.

09:13.751 --> 09:15.375
I think Sabrina is a win.

09:15.751 --> 09:20.083
I do not think. Anda
Harvey, gonna rock the runway.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.751
Actually Libby
I do not dance.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.542
Sorry?

09:24.751 --> 09:28.209
This is a dance
guess what you do here?

09:28.709 --> 09:31.542
Well, but for me,
dance is a metaphor.

09:32.751 --> 09:33.834
Why?

09:34.542 --> 09:36.209
I do not know anything?

09:37.042 --> 09:39.918
Can not believe I did it.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.209
Sasha!
Bathroom.

09:46.459 --> 09:48.292
Oh my, I am enjoying myself to the great.

09:48.292 --> 09:49.292
Me too.

09:58.334 --> 09:59.751
As previously stopped to dance?

10:00.417 --> 10:01.876
I saw a person.

10:01.876 --> 10:03.918
- Who?
- It's just a friend.

10:08.042 --> 10:11.250
This is fun. We did this
since the presidency of the Taft.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.709
Mm. What you put in your personality?

10:13.709 --> 10:17.125
I put a lot of optimism. Want
is a very optimistic.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.334
Ah, that's good.

10:18.542 --> 10:19.959
Ahah! Mine is ready.

10:21.626 --> 10:23.292
hello. I Hilda.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.334
Leave me alone?

10:25.751 --> 10:28.334
Still looking for work,
for bothering me.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.918
Did not seem very optimistic.

10:30.918 --> 10:32.501
Something went wrong.

10:32.626 --> 10:35.250
Check the date
validity of the optimism?

10:35.501 --> 10:38.959
- Oh no. Says not optimistic!
- Which means ...

10:38.959 --> 10:40.792
My meeting is hopeless.

10:40.834 --> 10:41.834
Ladies ...

10:43.209 --> 10:45.125
They want to end the feast of hens.

10:45.125 --> 10:48.417
Somewhere side is giving some kind
sports and I'm losing.

10:48.417 --> 10:51.209
Where is the TV?
Never mind, I find it.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.584
TV? TV? No.

10:54.918 --> 10:58.792
I have bad luck with men,
made with the same mass.

10:59.001 --> 11:00.542
Here. Want to start over?

11:00.542 --> 11:06.000
Yes .. No, wait. I have an idea.
Maybe you can change it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.209
Oh you know that Hilda
it never works.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.000
But I love a challenge.

11:10.209 --> 11:13.250
First, I earn his trust
pretending to like sports.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.501
Wait. Do you want to know mine?

11:16.834 --> 11:19.876
Let me guess. It is a firefighter
brave who loves milk?

11:19.876 --> 11:22.751
- How did you know?
- I found the calendar on the desk.

11:22.751 --> 11:25.375
The Sabrina is right,
there is no privacy in this house.

11:34.918 --> 11:37.375
Oh, hello kitty.
Got milk?

11:37.375 --> 11:40.459
What? Oh sorry, thought
they were talking to me.

11:43.751 --> 11:45.792
Oh my, this is the best
night of my life!

11:46.792 --> 11:49.167
Will you stop?
I am a bit tired.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.834
It is evil, come on. Though,
have to say I love this song.

11:52.834 --> 11:56.083
Well, then continues to dance.
Jenny, is here for me.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.834
Okay. But do not tarry,
I do not want to think that I sold.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.667
Hey, Harvey.
Are you busy?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.292
No, I dropped an item in the drink.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.667
Sounds good.

12:09.876 --> 12:11.125
Thank you too.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.000
This is what I used yesterday.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.792
But smell good.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.334
Where's Libby?

12:19.667 --> 12:22.709
In the bathroom, I think. It is
upset that I did not dance.

12:22.792 --> 12:25.459
Seriously
I thought I was good at it.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.626
Well, when I'm alone
in my room, yes.

12:28.626 --> 12:31.584
I mean, do not dance around
the man or something.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.167
I am very ashamed
in front of others.

12:34.167 --> 12:35.167
All we.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.083
Not your date.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.334
Oh, Chad is special.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.667
Wow I really like him, right?

12:42.667 --> 12:44.584
No! I wanted to say out of the ordinary.

12:44.584 --> 12:48.459
Hey, here you are.
Hello, I'm Chad Cory Dillan.

12:48.459 --> 12:50.042
Harvey Dwight Kinkle.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.334
Nice to meet you.

12:52.334 --> 12:55.375
Hey Sabrina, you have to come.
You do not know what you are losing.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.584
A highly musica?

12:57.292 --> 12:58.792
She knows everything.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.125
Hallelujah, come back, I thought
you had fallen inside.

13:04.709 --> 13:05.792
How charming.

13:08.125 --> 13:11.125
- What are you thinking?
- That referee is a stupid!

13:12.584 --> 13:15.584
We could talk while we see. I mean ...

13:15.876 --> 13:18.542
relationships are built
on the basis of communication.

13:18.751 --> 13:20.959
Why not shares
your feelings?

13:21.250 --> 13:22.876
Why not share the potatoes?

13:23.584 --> 13:25.667
- Simon, what I'm trying to do ...
- Look, look, look.

13:25.667 --> 13:29.375
When you give the advertising annoying,
we speak. Until then, you imported?

13:31.542 --> 13:34.834
Never seen a man drink so much milk.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.001
Aah! I love milk.

13:40.125 --> 13:44.209
Just do not see why not withheld
when I invited you to come to the party!

13:44.209 --> 13:46.417
I told you,
I have to work harder at it.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.083
Great! a quiet song.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.959
You know Chad,
'm not facing this dance.

13:51.959 --> 13:55.417
Why do not we
sit in those chairs?

13:56.209 --> 13:58.709
Genial!
You're a genius!

14:02.501 --> 14:05.167
This is too bizarre,
same for me.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.083
If you do not want to be here,
just go.

14:09.751 --> 14:13.001
- I do not say this to many people, but ...
- Here he is!

14:13.584 --> 14:17.042
- Hello I'm Libby.
- Hey, I'm Chad.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.918
I saw you dancing,
are really good.

14:20.042 --> 14:23.042
Well, I am also bold
and a rock musician.

14:23.042 --> 14:25.792
Really!
What instrument holes?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.417
I play lead guitar.

14:28.626 --> 14:29.876
Guitar solo!

14:30.042 --> 14:32.167
Hey Harvey,
burrows not an instrument?

14:32.209 --> 14:34.042
Yap. The bassoon.

14:34.167 --> 14:37.209
Wow, bassoon.
I find it very sexy.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.042
Perhaps, for a bassoon.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.876
Oh my, I love this song!

14:41.876 --> 14:44.918
Me too. Unfortunately
my partner can not dance.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.292
You know yes. Incidentally, Harvey
is a wonderful dancer.

14:49.292 --> 14:51.918
Sabrina! Technically
is not true.

14:51.918 --> 14:54.959
It is.
Why not the evidence now.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.167
Okay,
may know a few steps.

15:09.751 --> 15:12.792
Yah! Harvey is dancing
alone. Way to go!

15:15.083 --> 15:16.709
He is even better than Chad.

15:16.709 --> 15:17.709
Much better.

15:32.959 --> 15:35.417
- Has anyone seen?
- All saw.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.584
Now I am even ashamed.

15:37.584 --> 15:39.001
Let's dance.
I feel inspired.

15:39.209 --> 15:40.584
- But ...
- It is better to go.

15:40.584 --> 15:42.667
What!
Now I want to dance with you.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.584
Sorry, but you said
I could go if he wanted.

15:45.584 --> 15:47.584
I take it back.
You have to dance with me.

15:47.584 --> 15:50.542
Libby ... No!

15:52.876 --> 15:57.542
Wait Chad, this is not right,
Sorry but I have to go.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.459
Harvey!

16:01.250 --> 16:02.083
Harvey!

16:03.584 --> 16:04.459
Harvey!

16:04.834 --> 16:06.042
I'm here.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.042
I thought you were gone!

16:08.250 --> 16:11.542
And he was, but I have to be
waiting for the "triple A".

16:11.751 --> 16:15.542
Well, I can help you to wait.
I'm good at it, he notes.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.709
Thank you,
but you should not be in there ...

16:18.709 --> 16:20.751
with which is the name,
what is the name, what is the name?

16:21.459 --> 16:23.334
Nah, it's not my type.

16:23.334 --> 16:25.209
Why perfect is not your type?

16:26.042 --> 16:28.334
Indeed Harvey
I want to talk to you about it.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.083
But it's hard for me.

16:32.209 --> 16:33.501
What do you mean?

16:33.751 --> 16:37.876
Well, is this ...
I. .. can you see ...

16:37.876 --> 16:39.250
Sabrina, what is?

16:39.250 --> 16:40.250
Ice!

16:40.834 --> 16:44.042
I came to this party in the expectation
pass a good time with Chad,

16:44.042 --> 16:47.042
but when I saw you, eventually.

16:47.501 --> 16:51.584
I think great
be friends, but ...

16:51.751 --> 16:53.834
sometimes wish it was
more than that.

16:55.334 --> 16:57.626
I love you, Harvey.
I like too much of you, but ...

16:58.417 --> 17:01.876
I think by now, this is the only
way to get to tell you.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.083
Thanks for hearing.

17:07.541 --> 17:08.917
Did you say something?

17:08.917 --> 17:12.416
Yah. He said
Chad is not perfect.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.209
You know, has one arm
larger than the other.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.459
Well, you better come back.

17:18.209 --> 17:24.250
Sabrina was kind of thinking that a
Since here we are, do not you dance?

17:25.001 --> 17:26.416
You will not feel ashamed?

17:27.416 --> 17:28.626
We're just us.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.584
So, you love this music?

17:46.876 --> 17:47.876
It's nice.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.751
I'm getting a little embarrassed.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.042
Okay, I am.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.501
Sorry, that's all I can do.

18:01.250 --> 18:04.292
Was enough.
I'm ready to go.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.918
Since you want
leave the party ...

18:05.918 --> 18:08.584
do not want to go play
a game of table football?

18:08.584 --> 18:09.959
Yah, I love table football!

18:11.042 --> 18:13.542
Excuse
spent too much time with Chad.

18:14.918 --> 18:16.751
Well, I'll tell you that I'm leaving.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.125
I love you, Sabrina.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.709
Why do not you tell him in the face?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.334
Sabrina, come back!

18:29.501 --> 18:30.918
Chad have to talk.

18:30.918 --> 18:34.417
Look, it was sweet of you
bring me to the party, but ...

18:34.459 --> 18:35.834
but not with you I want to be.

18:36.042 --> 18:37.876
And who?

18:37.876 --> 18:38.876
Harvey.

18:39.209 --> 18:41.292
is an excellent choice,
it is a nice guy.

18:41.918 --> 18:43.751
Really are the same
a meeting of dream, Chad.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.834
So do not mind to go?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.209
Oh, sure, go ahead.
I'm here to miss you.

18:52.209 --> 18:53.792
I do not want you to.

18:53.792 --> 18:57.375
Look, we only have 2 more hours and have the
sure you love this song, so ...

18:57.667 --> 18:59.667
Why do not you invite
Libby to dance?

19:00.292 --> 19:02.417
I?
I like Libby.

19:02.834 --> 19:03.918
Do you like the Libby?

19:04.626 --> 19:06.918
Sorry, I think I
starting to look bad.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.250
Come on, win or lose.

19:13.918 --> 19:16.501
Hey, look.
The same size. Ha!

19:19.000 --> 19:22.083
So if you live by the pass,
die by the pass.

19:22.083 --> 19:25.626
They keep the ball down and staying fit
to put the ball in the red zone.

19:25.626 --> 19:28.667
You know, I can not hear Pat Samerell
while you are chattering.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.918
It's about advertising tools.

19:30.918 --> 19:31.918
Shh! Are talking about hammers.

19:32.626 --> 19:33.918
Okay, is this.

19:35.459 --> 19:36.501
Done!

19:36.501 --> 19:38.584
- 90 seconds.
- Got it!

19:38.834 --> 19:39.584
Here I go.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.584
Be right back.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.667
So what now?

19:49.292 --> 19:53.334
Well, I can register your bike
or make lasagna for 50!?

19:53.334 --> 19:54.959
Teach me to do
mouth to mouth?

19:54.959 --> 20:00.792
Sure, but first I have to drink more
milk to fortify my body.

20:01.375 --> 20:04.584
Yes, I finally understood
with Simon.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.751
Since my meeting
was a failure,

20:12.751 --> 20:14.667
it seems that we
have to share yours.

20:14.667 --> 20:18.918
Oh Oh no! I do not share.
He's mine.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.375
- Do not be evil.
- It was I who did it, drop it.

20:21.375 --> 20:22.375
Not off.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.751
Go! Go!

20:26.292 --> 20:28.000
Look, see what you did?

20:28.626 --> 20:29.792
My milk!

20:29.792 --> 20:31.834
Since it is spoiled.
Can I have it?

20:33.125 --> 20:34.959
Oh I love this song!

20:34.959 --> 20:37.209
We were made for each other.

20:47.042 --> 20:49.501
I ... to find ... condoms!

20:54.876 --> 20:56.751
Chad!
Chad!

20:58.626 --> 21:00.667
Chad? Chad?

21:05.417 --> 21:06.709
Gross!

21:12.000 --> 21:16.918
I have really enjoyed.
Oh my, I love this song!

21:20.792 --> 21:22.292
Speak a detective?

21:22.375 --> 21:24.459
Okay, I want to participate
disappearance.

21:24.667 --> 21:25.876
Chad Cory Dillan.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.751
He is very high,
and is very beautiful.

21:28.751 --> 21:32.167
He was last seen dancing with me,
were all looking at, it was fantastic.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.792
What? ... Well, he's just gone
to 20 minutes but I think ...

21:36.459 --> 21:38.167
No, I will not wait 24 hours.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.834
You do not realize that he
is the love of my life?

21:42.125 --> 21:45.792
Hello?
Hello?
