00:01.069 --> 00:02.858
In the criminal justice system

00:02.925 --> 00:04.616
sexually based offenses

00:04.686 --> 00:06.377
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.445 --> 00:08.617
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.685 --> 00:10.441
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.509 --> 00:12.135
are members of an elite squad

00:12.205 --> 00:13.831
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.901 --> 00:15.526
These are their stories.

00:18.445 --> 00:19.874
Guy's a slacker.

00:19.949 --> 00:23.364
Didn't contribute, showed up late.
Study group didn't need the dead weight.

00:23.437 --> 00:26.536
What'd you do? Tossed him
out on his pompous ass.

00:28.781 --> 00:30.788
Hey, there's that bum again.

00:30.861 --> 00:33.512
What's he up to? Probably
fertilizing the bushes.

00:33.581 --> 00:34.922
Hey, Harry.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.793
Where you going, Harry?

00:42.061 --> 00:44.264
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.

00:45.324 --> 00:47.462
Name's Kelly D'leah,
student at Hanford.

00:47.533 --> 00:51.078
Couple of joggers found her in the bushes
off the campus quad about 7:00 a. m.

00:51.148 --> 00:53.123
Her condition?
Semi-conscious, no panties...

00:53.195 --> 00:54.886
smell of alcohol
on her breath.

00:54.956 --> 00:57.674
Cordoned off the area, called
CSU. Partner's still on scene.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.391
What'd the doctor say?
That's him. Hey, Doc...

01:00.461 --> 01:02.761
Detectives Benson and
Stabler. What do we got?

01:02.828 --> 01:05.546
She's a little vague on the
details, but has all the earmarks.

01:05.612 --> 01:08.961
Abrasions to knees, arms, bruising
about the pelvis and neck, hickeys.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.010
Rape kit turn up anything?
Haven't done it.

01:11.083 --> 01:13.833
Once I started the exam,
she refused to proceed.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.234
I was hoping you might
be able to persuade her.

01:16.299 --> 01:17.347
Okay.

01:19.115 --> 01:20.871
Just a little longer.

01:25.355 --> 01:29.217
And that should do it.
Okay, Kelly. The exam's over.

01:30.027 --> 01:34.403
This is a high dose of oral
contraceptives. Birth control pills?

01:34.475 --> 01:36.296
The doctor found semen.

01:37.643 --> 01:41.026
What? The rapist didn't use a condom.

01:42.762 --> 01:44.071
No.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.211
The pills will
prevent pregnancy.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.551
We'll also give you
an antibiotic for any STDs...

01:48.619 --> 01:51.586
that may have been transmitted. No.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.173
No, I can't.

01:55.818 --> 01:58.274
You can't what, Kelly?
I can't deal with this.

01:58.346 --> 02:00.385
Okay, sweetheart, you don't
have to decide right now.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.563
But you will have to
within the next day or two...

02:02.634 --> 02:04.706
or the regimen
will be ineffective.

02:04.841 --> 02:07.176
You don't understand...

02:09.193 --> 02:10.852
I'm a virgin.

03:02.665 --> 03:05.731
Hi, I'm looking for Kelly D'leah.
They brought her in this morning.

03:05.801 --> 03:08.102
Are you a relative?
No, her roommate, Dana Kimble.

03:08.168 --> 03:10.056
I just brought her
a fresh change of clothes.

03:10.119 --> 03:11.746
Dana. Detective Stabler.

03:12.521 --> 03:15.270
I came as soon as the
hospital called. How is she?

03:15.335 --> 03:16.384
She's still with the doctor.

03:16.456 --> 03:19.391
Tell you what, though. Come on
over here, I'll talk with you, okay?

03:19.465 --> 03:21.886
Should be finished soon,
but in the meantime...

03:21.959 --> 03:23.748
do you know
where she was last night?

03:23.816 --> 03:27.393
She was out with Tess and Jodie,
a couple of our sorority sisters.

03:27.464 --> 03:30.692
They said she was still partying at
the Beta Lambda house when they left.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.832
What time was that?
About 1:30.

03:32.904 --> 03:36.766
They say who they left her with?
Joe Templeton and Hank Ludlow.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.596
They friends of hers?

03:39.783 --> 03:43.198
I wouldn't exactly call them friends,
but I know Joe had a thing for her.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.548
Okay, what's
that mean, "thing"?

03:44.615 --> 03:47.266
Ever since she shot him down
at a rush party last semester...

03:47.336 --> 03:49.822
he's been on her to go out
with him. Why won't she?

03:49.895 --> 03:52.578
She knows his type.
What type is that?

03:52.935 --> 03:54.145
He's a player.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.153
You know, she flirts with him
to tweak his ego a little bit.

03:57.222 --> 03:58.172
Yeah?

03:58.855 --> 04:01.157
She knows where
to draw the line.

04:02.022 --> 04:05.284
That's why I got worried when
she didn't come home last night.

04:05.735 --> 04:07.775
Okay, excuse me
one second, okay?

04:09.831 --> 04:12.319
Doctor confirms semen
and a torn hymen.

04:12.391 --> 04:14.562
Unfortunately, the victim's
a little vague on details.

04:14.631 --> 04:15.874
Blood alcohol's
still point 0.4.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.812
Roommate said she'd been out partying
with two frat boys last night.

04:18.886 --> 04:22.017
Let's hope they can explain
how she wound up in the bushes.

04:22.599 --> 04:23.678
I got a crime scene here.

04:23.749 --> 04:25.573
Should we rescue Gordy
from the campus fuzz?

04:25.638 --> 04:26.883
Better, or we'll be here
all day.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.957
Look, it'll take as long
as it takes.

04:29.030 --> 04:31.966
We need this area cleared for
pedestrians. What's the problem?

04:32.037 --> 04:34.590
We got 10,000 students swarming
this quad by 9:00 a. m...

04:34.661 --> 04:37.661
and your guys are still beating the
weeds looking for God knows what.

04:37.734 --> 04:40.068
It's a crime scene, Barney.
They're looking for evidence.

04:40.134 --> 04:41.443
Name's Monroe, Detective...

04:41.511 --> 04:43.582
and crime scene or not,
this is private property.

04:43.653 --> 04:45.508
The city's gonna pay
for these shrubs?

04:45.573 --> 04:49.283
I arrest you for obstructing justice,
the university gonna pay your bail?

04:49.349 --> 04:51.586
Just make it quick, will you?

04:52.677 --> 04:54.172
What do you got?
Used condom...

04:54.246 --> 04:56.734
handbag with the victim's
hairbrush and ID, and this scarf.

04:56.806 --> 04:58.366
Styling.
Bag it all.

04:58.437 --> 05:00.412
Where are the joggers?
Up there.

05:01.540 --> 05:04.956
I'm Detective Munch. This is
my partner, Detective Tutuola.

05:05.029 --> 05:08.541
We understand you found her. She
was laying down in the bushes.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.486
At first, I thought she was
dead, then I heard her moaning.

05:11.558 --> 05:14.786
She say anything?
A name. Josh, or John.

05:14.853 --> 05:17.024
It was hard to make out.
Anybody else around?

05:17.093 --> 05:19.481
Just this little creep
who loiters around campus.

05:19.557 --> 05:20.702
What's he look like?

05:20.773 --> 05:22.813
Greasy hair,
wears an old army coat.

05:22.885 --> 05:26.682
Took off the minute he spotted
us. Where can we find this guy?

05:31.268 --> 05:34.017
Want some syrup with
those flapjacks there, slappy?

05:45.829 --> 05:47.650
I didn't do anything.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.466
Why'd you run?
You were chasing me.

05:55.972 --> 05:58.655
You Kelly D'leah?
No, it's Harry.

05:58.723 --> 06:02.368
Harry, you're under arrest for
possession of stolen property.

06:02.436 --> 06:03.961
So take us through it, Kelly.

06:04.035 --> 06:08.640
Jodie, Tess, and I left the house about
9:30 and headed to the Kollege Keg...

06:08.804 --> 06:10.014
a bar near campus.

06:10.084 --> 06:12.254
Is that where you met up
with Joe and Hank?

06:12.323 --> 06:14.810
Yeah, they invited us to
join them at a booth.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.925
How long did you stay?

06:16.996 --> 06:20.126
An hour, maybe two.
Then what happened?

06:20.323 --> 06:23.454
We went to the Beta house to
play video games in Joe's room.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.180
Tell us about Joe.

06:25.699 --> 06:28.514
Not much to tell.
Typical frat rat.

06:28.579 --> 06:31.394
Your roommate said
that he had a thing for you.

06:31.778 --> 06:34.299
We flirted,
but it's not serious.

06:34.371 --> 06:37.218
What about Hank?
You gotta be kidding me.

06:37.282 --> 06:40.730
Did either one of these guys
make sexual advances toward you?

06:41.282 --> 06:44.991
Not more than usual,
but we were just having fun.

06:47.042 --> 06:49.278
How much
did you have to drink?

06:51.521 --> 06:53.943
One or two glasses
of margaritas.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.155
A few sips of beer
at the house.

06:56.226 --> 06:58.877
What's the last thing
that you remember that night?

06:58.945 --> 07:03.385
We were all sitting on the
floor, talking, laughing...

07:03.713 --> 07:08.383
and after that, it gets fuzzy.
What do you mean, "fuzzy?"

07:11.329 --> 07:13.118
I remember feeling cold...

07:14.178 --> 07:16.512
and someone
pulling on my hair.

07:17.569 --> 07:19.195
But then, nothing.

07:21.281 --> 07:24.926
I didn't think that I was drinking
that much, but I must have been.

07:24.993 --> 07:27.928
This wouldn't have happened
if I wasn't, right?

07:29.889 --> 07:31.743
Oh, God, what did I do?

07:36.130 --> 07:38.038
What did I do?

07:41.825 --> 07:45.141
Stellar bio you got here,
Harry. Petty theft, vagrancy.

07:45.217 --> 07:48.381
Even pinched a couple of times for
window shopping at the girl's dorm.

07:48.449 --> 07:51.318
I never hurt anybody.
So, why you taking souvenirs?

07:51.425 --> 07:53.312
Found them in the bushes.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.442
I was on my way to lost
and found to turn them in.

07:57.151 --> 07:59.541
Since when is lost and found
in a dumpster?

08:00.031 --> 08:02.421
I had to eat first.
Come again?

08:02.497 --> 08:05.343
Breakfast leftovers,
they get tossed by 11:00.

08:06.304 --> 08:09.272
Wanted to get my eats
while they were still hot.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.058
You think this is a joke?
No.

08:12.767 --> 08:13.978
No joke.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.182
I go there everyday.
Not anymore.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.157
We got you on possession
of stolen property.

08:19.232 --> 08:23.126
And we're a blood test away from
nailing your little scruffy ass for rape.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.742
Should've used a condom, Harry.
Please, I can't stand needles.

08:26.848 --> 08:29.530
No needles, please. Then
look, come at us straight...

08:29.599 --> 08:31.704
and maybe we can work
something out.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.006
All right.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.275
I was making my rounds...

08:40.640 --> 08:42.461
she came out of the house.

08:43.038 --> 08:44.948
What house?
Frat house.

08:45.983 --> 08:50.074
She was all wobbly, like
she was drunk. What time?

08:50.143 --> 08:54.420
Sun wasn't up, but it was
getting light. I followed her.

08:56.062 --> 08:59.096
She fell down a few times,
got up.

08:59.391 --> 09:03.319
Last time, she stayed down.
I went over.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.559
She was out cold.

09:06.590 --> 09:08.281
I took the money...

09:09.054 --> 09:10.330
the cards.

09:11.390 --> 09:14.837
I never raped anybody.

09:18.783 --> 09:20.473
You sons of bitches.

09:20.543 --> 09:24.371
You said I wouldn't have to take
a needle. Yeah, well, we lied.

09:24.573 --> 09:25.686
What do you think?

09:25.759 --> 09:27.798
If he was moving his way up
the food chain...

09:27.870 --> 09:30.259
from peeping Tom to rapist, she
would have been an easy mark.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.635
On the other hand, if his blood
test comes back negative...

09:32.701 --> 09:35.156
we're back to square one.
What did you find at the scene?

09:35.229 --> 09:38.841
Usual collegiate artifacts, used condom.
But since the rapist left semen...

09:38.909 --> 09:41.211
Test it anyway. What
about the missing panties?

09:41.278 --> 09:44.146
Still missing. Along with
about six hours of memory.

09:44.221 --> 09:46.076
All right, talk to
her party companions.

09:46.140 --> 09:49.305
See if we can start filling
in some of that missing time.

09:51.996 --> 09:53.851
We got to the house
about 11:00.

09:54.109 --> 09:55.516
What'd you do once
you got there?

09:55.581 --> 09:57.784
We went to Joe's room to play
strip poker on his computer.

09:57.853 --> 10:00.406
You been drinking?
We were all pretty happy.

10:00.477 --> 10:03.095
But, Kelly was pretty loose.
Really? How loose?

10:03.164 --> 10:06.066
She was hanging all over Joe,
making a fool of herself.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.344
But what else is new?
That happen a lot?

10:08.413 --> 10:10.486
She was always glued
on somebody.

10:10.557 --> 10:13.076
How long were you at the
Beta house? For a while.

10:13.149 --> 10:15.570
But when Kelly stripped down
to her bra and panties...

10:15.644 --> 10:17.749
Tess and I decided
to call it a night.

10:17.820 --> 10:20.024
You guys just left her there?

10:20.092 --> 10:22.329
She was giving Joe
a lap dance.

10:23.101 --> 10:25.402
And Joe?
He was lapping it up.

10:25.468 --> 10:26.876
Wouldn't you?

10:27.549 --> 10:28.759
Yeah, she had the hot ticket.

10:28.827 --> 10:32.603
And I'd have been happy to punch it for her
if she hadn't have puked all over the floor.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.667
Kind of put the old muzzle on Mr.
Happy, if you know what I mean.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.845
Anybody witness
this fateful hurl?

10:37.916 --> 10:41.015
Yeah, sure. We set up
bleachers and charged admission.

10:41.468 --> 10:44.337
What did you do after the wind
went out of your little sail?

10:44.412 --> 10:48.274
I left her on my bed to sleep it off. And
I went downstairs to crash on the sofa.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.257
I was in the TV room
watching wrestling...

10:50.331 --> 10:53.463
and Joe came in, threw me a blanket.
Told me we were sleeping there.

10:53.531 --> 10:56.215
You know, luckily, I had a good
buzz on. I passed out on the floor.

10:56.284 --> 10:58.585
And you got no idea how Kelly
wound up in the bushes?

10:58.651 --> 11:00.723
Look, man, I don't know
what this chick told you...

11:00.796 --> 11:03.031
but I heard she worked her way
through the Kappa Sigs...

11:03.099 --> 11:05.946
before setting her sights
on Joe. So she had it coming?

11:06.011 --> 11:06.994
I didn't say that.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.329
But I can tell you for a fact
that it wasn't Joe or me.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.881
Harry's blood type
doesn't match the semen.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.320
Any luck with her friends?

11:15.387 --> 11:18.518
According to her sorority sisters,
she was making all the moves.

11:18.587 --> 11:20.856
I thought she was a virgin.
Technically.

11:20.922 --> 11:24.217
Word on campus was, she was doing a
lot of practicing for her oral exam.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.257
So she deserves to be raped?

11:26.330 --> 11:28.185
We don't even know
if those rumors are true.

11:28.249 --> 11:30.160
Yeah, but witnesses said
she came on to Joe.

11:30.234 --> 11:33.976
No, witnesses said she flirted. A lap
dance sends a pretty strong signal.

11:34.043 --> 11:35.155
She was drunk.
So was he.

11:35.225 --> 11:36.241
So that excuses him?

11:36.314 --> 11:38.257
No, but her behavior's
open to interpretation.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.330
She might have played it out and woke
up with a case of buyer's remorse.

11:41.402 --> 11:44.085
So now we're blaming the
victim? Nobody is blaming her...

11:44.154 --> 11:47.602
but we all know how hard it is to get
an indictment on a he-said, she-said...

11:47.675 --> 11:49.364
even without the ambiguities.

11:49.434 --> 11:50.448
That was the lab.

11:50.522 --> 11:54.199
Tox screen just came back. They
found traces of GHB in Kelly's urine.

11:54.265 --> 11:56.305
So much for the ambiguities.

11:56.537 --> 11:59.503
Only one reason to slip
someone a date rape drug.

11:59.577 --> 12:02.708
Find out who spiked her drink,
you find the rapist.

12:04.570 --> 12:06.392
I met with
the dean of students.

12:06.457 --> 12:08.280
She said if I don't
press criminal charges...

12:08.345 --> 12:10.550
she can have the university's
disciplinary committee...

12:10.618 --> 12:12.439
handle my case
without a public trial.

12:12.505 --> 12:15.734
Rape is a criminal offense.
What if it was my fault?

12:16.153 --> 12:18.291
Jodie and Tess said I was
half naked when they left.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.377
I don't even remember.

12:19.449 --> 12:22.002
That's because they found GHB
in your system.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.567
What's GHB?

12:23.641 --> 12:26.096
It's a drug
that reduces inhibitions.

12:26.169 --> 12:28.852
The vomiting and the chills
were side effects.

12:28.921 --> 12:30.863
You could have died, Kelly.

12:30.937 --> 12:32.246
But I didn't take anything.

12:32.312 --> 12:34.287
Somebody probably
slipped it into your drink.

12:34.361 --> 12:37.677
Whoever did this to you took away
your ability to consent to have sex.

12:37.752 --> 12:38.931
He raped you.

12:40.889 --> 12:43.758
Who? That's what we're
trying to find out.

12:43.992 --> 12:46.031
But we need you to help us.

12:46.488 --> 12:48.976
You said you were drinking
margaritas at the bar.

12:49.047 --> 12:51.284
You ever leave
your drink unattended?

12:51.352 --> 12:54.648
Joe and I got up to dance, and
I went to the restroom once.

12:54.712 --> 12:57.942
But both times, I left my glass
on the table with everybody else's.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.910
How'd you feel when you left?
Fine, I guess.

13:00.984 --> 13:04.245
You go straight to the frat
house? Had a beer there?

13:04.824 --> 13:06.285
They kept pouring more
into my glass.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.142
But, that's when I started
to feel dizzy, so I stopped.

13:09.207 --> 13:12.655
Did anybody else join you at the
frat, once you got to Joe's room?

13:13.016 --> 13:14.641
Wally Parker.

13:15.159 --> 13:16.501
Who's Wally Parker?

13:16.568 --> 13:19.285
One of the brothers.
But he didn't stay long.

13:19.351 --> 13:21.490
So, that leaves
Hank and Joe.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.205
You think it's one of them?
We don't know...

13:24.279 --> 13:27.508
but for now, why don't we just keep
this conversation between us, okay?

13:27.576 --> 13:30.292
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

13:34.774 --> 13:37.230
You know how many frat rats
come in here every night?

13:37.303 --> 13:38.764
I wonder how many of them
are underage.

13:38.839 --> 13:42.188
Suppose we send in
an undercover team and see.

13:43.766 --> 13:45.709
It's the Babe.
Who?

13:46.103 --> 13:47.728
Bets me $20
against a free beer...

13:47.798 --> 13:49.805
that he can call a home run
at the top of the night...

13:49.878 --> 13:51.917
like Babe Ruth
in the World Series.

13:51.990 --> 13:55.218
Points out a girl,
if he bags her, he wins.

13:55.286 --> 13:58.635
What's his batting average? He
drinks a lot more than he pays.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.844
He ever take a swing
at this one?

14:03.062 --> 14:04.273
The other night.

14:04.342 --> 14:06.000
She walked in with
a couple other hotties.

14:06.070 --> 14:07.979
Joe was sitting here
with his sidekick. Hank?

14:08.053 --> 14:10.028
Yeah. Joe picked her out
and laid down his bet.

14:10.102 --> 14:12.971
Only this time,
bets me $50 against a pitcher.

14:13.046 --> 14:15.697
Getting cocky?
Ain't cocky if you deliver.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.675
Did he deliver with this one?

14:18.773 --> 14:20.912
Half hour later,
he's walking her out the door.

14:20.982 --> 14:23.764
I'm telling you, guy's got
an eye for the long ball.

14:27.413 --> 14:29.421
Yes, I spoke to Miss D'leah
this morning...

14:29.493 --> 14:30.921
and I gave her
my full support.

14:30.997 --> 14:33.234
But you tried to talk her out
of pressing criminal charges.

14:33.302 --> 14:35.887
I gave her an alternative
to criminal proceedings.

14:35.957 --> 14:37.168
The decision is hers.

14:37.237 --> 14:39.986
How exactly does this disciplinary
committee of yours work?

14:40.053 --> 14:43.599
It's composed of three
students and three faculty.

14:43.669 --> 14:46.703
Each presents their case, along
with three other witnesses...

14:46.772 --> 14:49.423
then the committee deliberates
and renders a decision.

14:49.492 --> 14:51.402
What kind of sentences
do you hand down for rape?

14:51.477 --> 14:54.444
Since we don't have criminal
jurisdiction, we can't incarcerate.

14:54.517 --> 14:57.200
However, we can suspend,
and, if warranted, expel.

14:57.268 --> 15:00.977
Has Joe Templeton or Hank Ludlow been
involved in a case like this before?

15:01.045 --> 15:02.474
I'm not at liberty to say.

15:02.549 --> 15:06.346
Dean Richter, you realize we're talking
about a girl who's been drugged and raped.

15:06.419 --> 15:08.046
I'm not unsympathetic.

15:08.117 --> 15:10.287
However, I cannot release
a student's private records...

15:10.356 --> 15:12.941
unless I have written
permission, or a court order.

15:15.604 --> 15:18.920
Sometimes the thought of Maureen in
college scares the hell out of me.

15:18.995 --> 15:20.010
I don't blame you.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.954
Higher education used to mean
B.A. s and Ph. D.s.

15:23.061 --> 15:24.882
Now it's roofies and GHB.

15:24.949 --> 15:28.014
And deans with confidential
disciplinary committees.

15:28.084 --> 15:30.986
It's an extension of the loco
parentis role of the university.

15:31.156 --> 15:32.945
They prefer to keep
these matters in house...

15:33.012 --> 15:34.899
to save the students
the ordeal of a public trial.

15:34.963 --> 15:37.167
And to relieve the school
of any public embarrassment.

15:37.234 --> 15:40.367
The dean definitely did not feel
comfortable playing public relations...

15:40.435 --> 15:43.435
which makes me think those student
records are gonna tell us a story.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.068
What'll it take to
get those records?

15:45.140 --> 15:47.823
The university will quash a
subpoena without more evidence.

15:47.891 --> 15:50.793
Evidence. No evidence
without those records.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.209
Hell of a catch-22.

15:52.275 --> 15:55.591
If this guy is a sexual predator,
chances are he's left other victims.

15:55.668 --> 15:58.155
If we establish a pattern,
we've got our probable cause.

15:58.227 --> 15:59.372
Any suggestions?

15:59.443 --> 16:02.258
Fin and I made friends with a guy
in the campus police department.

16:02.323 --> 16:04.145
We did?
Nick, the campus dick.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.244
Maybe, we can appeal to his fraternal
sense of brotherhood among cops.

16:07.315 --> 16:09.770
Kelly also mentioned a third
guy that was in Joe's room.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.890
Maybe he's worth a shot.

16:10.963 --> 16:14.279
Tell you what, at this point,
anything's worth a shot.

16:14.611 --> 16:16.912
All right, I'll see you later.
Wally Parker?

16:16.979 --> 16:18.701
Can I talk to you a minute?

16:19.059 --> 16:21.612
Is this about Kelly? We heard
you were there the other night.

16:21.682 --> 16:24.682
Not for long. I had a philosophy
exam, so I left to study.

16:24.754 --> 16:28.463
Now, before you left, did you
have any interaction with Kelly?

16:28.786 --> 16:30.640
What do you mean?
You talk with her?

16:30.707 --> 16:31.917
A little.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.795
She seem lucid to you
at the time?

16:35.154 --> 16:37.488
She was partying.
Was she dressed?

16:37.554 --> 16:38.601
Yeah.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.020
Anything seem out of
whack to you? Like what?

16:44.882 --> 16:46.224
You tell me.

16:48.017 --> 16:50.865
You either talk to us here,
or you talk to us downtown.

16:50.930 --> 16:53.831
Because right now we got you
pegged as an accomplice...

16:53.906 --> 16:58.096
so you'll have plenty of time to test the
bonds of brotherhood in criminal court.

17:01.105 --> 17:04.551
About 1:00, I went downstairs
for a drink of water...

17:04.626 --> 17:08.651
I saw Hank and Joe
sacked out in the TV room.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.542
And when I went back upstairs, she
was in Joe's room by herself, crying.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.756
Over what?
She wouldn't say.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.339
Her hair was messed up, and
there was vomit on the floor.

17:19.409 --> 17:21.513
She looked like
she needed a friend.

17:21.776 --> 17:24.526
I offered to walk her home,
and by the time I got my coat...

17:24.593 --> 17:26.284
she was already gone.

17:27.153 --> 17:28.493
Back to bust my chops?

17:28.560 --> 17:30.219
Actually, we came
to apologize.

17:30.288 --> 17:32.427
We might have been a little
harsh with you the other day.

17:32.497 --> 17:34.351
You know how it is,
boss breathing down our necks.

17:34.416 --> 17:37.580
Bad day all around. We're
not all windup cops, you know.

17:37.648 --> 17:39.656
I'm finishing my criminology
degree next month...

17:39.728 --> 17:41.867
and applying to the Feds.
My cousin's a G-man.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.357
I could put in a good word
as a professional courtesy.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.887
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

17:46.991 --> 17:50.253
We need some information on a student
who may have caused you problems.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.814
Who?
Joe Templeton.

17:51.887 --> 17:54.124
You make him for the
doer in that rape? Maybe.

17:54.192 --> 17:55.566
We'd like to pull
his records...

17:55.631 --> 17:58.697
but we're having problems getting
past the gatekeeper in the ivory tower.

17:58.768 --> 18:01.931
And you want me to ignore university
policy to help you make your case?

18:01.999 --> 18:04.520
We want you
to help us nail a rapist.

18:07.311 --> 18:10.061
Off the record,
the guy's a piece of work.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.542
In fact, I take more calls on that
house than any other frat on campus.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.597
What's his deal?

18:14.670 --> 18:17.224
Last semester, a woman on the
swim team claimed he raped her.

18:17.294 --> 18:18.701
Why isn't he in our system?

18:18.766 --> 18:21.516
She pressed charges through the
university's disciplinary board.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.925
Any details?

18:23.343 --> 18:26.158
Templeton got her drunk, did
her while she was in a stupor.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.617
Mandy Schumacher?
Yes.

18:32.687 --> 18:35.305
I'm Detective Munch. This is
my partner, Detective Tutuola.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.261
Can we talk?
Sure.

18:38.382 --> 18:40.073
It was a rush party.

18:40.303 --> 18:42.920
He started hitting on me
the minute I walked in.

18:43.535 --> 18:46.317
We danced,
and I had a lot to drink.

18:46.670 --> 18:49.452
The only thing I remember is him
on top of me, pulling my hair.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.078
I must have blacked out.

18:51.150 --> 18:54.532
Next morning, I woke up
with these God-awful hickeys.

18:54.607 --> 18:56.777
I don't even know
how I got home.

18:57.517 --> 19:00.300
If you blacked out, how
did you know you were raped?

19:00.366 --> 19:01.446
I didn't...

19:01.742 --> 19:04.775
until a few weeks later, when
I found out I was pregnant.

19:04.974 --> 19:08.138
I did the math.
It had to be him.

19:09.101 --> 19:11.687
I ended up getting an
abortion. What else could I do?

19:11.757 --> 19:13.897
Why didn't you call
the police?

19:14.701 --> 19:17.188
I spoke with my advisor
and a lawyer.

19:18.094 --> 19:20.101
Both agreed that I didn't have
much of a case...

19:20.173 --> 19:23.718
since there was no evidence,
and I couldn't remember anything.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.177
So I filed a complaint
with the review board.

19:26.253 --> 19:29.384
They found him guilty of
conduct unbecoming a student.

19:29.804 --> 19:32.804
He got put on probation
for one academic semester.

19:33.357 --> 19:35.211
You run into him since?

19:35.278 --> 19:38.091
Yeah, we see each other
on campus from time to time.

19:38.284 --> 19:40.040
He even tried to ask me out.

19:40.749 --> 19:41.959
I slapped him.

19:42.861 --> 19:46.276
Now he just snickers when he
passes by with his buddies.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.312
It's like being raped
all over again.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.263
Final labs
from Kelly's rape kit.

19:56.331 --> 19:59.464
In addition to semen, the rapist
left behind another little gift.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.769
Gonorrhea.
The gift that keeps on giving.

20:01.835 --> 20:04.553
He either doesn't know
he has it, or doesn't care.

20:04.619 --> 20:05.732
How could he not know?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.357
Some carriers
don't show obvious symptoms.

20:08.429 --> 20:10.151
Which means he could have
infected others.

20:10.219 --> 20:11.364
Or still may.

20:11.435 --> 20:13.857
We tie Joe to the GHB,
we can arrest him.

20:13.932 --> 20:16.168
We got enough for a
search warrant? Not yet.

20:16.235 --> 20:18.722
But we've got enough to secure
a subpoena for his records.

20:18.796 --> 20:20.705
And if those records
bear out Mandy's testimony...

20:20.779 --> 20:23.201
that'll give us a
search warrant. Let's go.

20:24.523 --> 20:28.102
I'm sorry, Robert, I'll call you
back. There's your court order...

20:28.172 --> 20:30.560
directing you to turn over
any personal, academic...

20:30.635 --> 20:33.385
and disciplinary files
for the individuals listed.

20:34.379 --> 20:36.485
You can't just walk in here
and invade their privacy.

20:36.555 --> 20:38.595
They're not even home.
We can and we are.

20:38.666 --> 20:41.830
Sir, please.
Get out of our way, squirt.

20:43.563 --> 20:46.148
Okay, look what we got here.
Hey.

20:46.858 --> 20:49.706
Blood stains. Didn't
bother to change the sheets.

20:50.059 --> 20:51.007
Guys...

20:53.515 --> 20:54.792
could be the mother lode.

20:54.859 --> 20:57.892
I'll take it to the lab, we'll
have an answer in an hour.

20:59.147 --> 21:01.797
See these graphic representations? Yeah.

21:01.866 --> 21:04.998
Each color represents a chemical
with a specific refraction rate.

21:05.066 --> 21:07.522
The graph on the left shows
the breakdown of the GHB...

21:07.594 --> 21:09.449
extracted from
the victim's urine.

21:09.515 --> 21:12.929
The graph on the right represents
the sample taken from the eyedropper.

21:13.002 --> 21:14.977
What do you see?
They look the same.

21:15.050 --> 21:16.576
That's because they are.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.684
The chemical composition of
the two samples is identical.

21:19.849 --> 21:22.371
We find out who made it, we
find out who drugged our victim.

21:22.442 --> 21:24.810
Right. How do you
make this stuff?

21:24.874 --> 21:26.729
The GHB tends
to be home-brewed.

21:26.794 --> 21:29.990
Often using cleaning solvent or
paint remover as base compounds.

21:30.057 --> 21:32.545
But this batch
is uncommonly pure.

21:32.618 --> 21:35.138
Whoever cooked it
had access to a lab.

21:35.370 --> 21:36.546
Thanks.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.224
Joe's been a busy guy.

21:40.297 --> 21:43.613
Every one of Mandy's witnesses
against Joe has a story to tell...

21:43.689 --> 21:44.736
none of them flattering.

21:44.809 --> 21:48.038
Gets them drunk, lures them to his
room, the hair pulling, the hickeys.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.698
It's like he's following
a play book.

21:49.770 --> 21:52.005
According to this, he offered
up only two witnesses...

21:52.074 --> 21:53.022
in his defense.

21:53.097 --> 21:56.675
Hank Ludlow, and his own
father, Joseph Templeton Sr.

21:56.746 --> 21:59.200
Now, what's his father doing
at a rush party?

21:59.977 --> 22:01.438
Character witness only.

22:01.513 --> 22:03.553
Guy must have some heft
with the university.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.705
Here we go.

22:04.905 --> 22:06.847
Mentions a chair he endowed
at the law school.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.223
Head of an alumni committee,
overseeing a building fund.

22:09.289 --> 22:11.493
No wonder little Joey got off
with a slap on the wrist.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.633
Not this time. Go.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.415
Hank Ludlow...

22:17.481 --> 22:21.376
you're under arrest for possession
of GHB, a controlled substance.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.237
Joe Templeton...

22:28.072 --> 22:29.632
put your hands right there.

22:29.704 --> 22:33.959
You're under arrest for possession
of GHB and the rape of Kelly D'leah.

22:34.216 --> 22:35.645
This is ridiculous.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.127
You have the right
to remain silent...

22:37.192 --> 22:39.297
and refuse to answer any
questions. Do you understand?

22:39.367 --> 22:42.466
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

22:42.536 --> 22:45.984
You have the right to an attorney. If
you cannot afford one, one will be...

22:50.471 --> 22:52.576
I demand to see my son.

22:53.159 --> 22:56.607
I'm sorry, Mr. Templeton, but he's
in with the detectives right now.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.330
I'm his father.
I have a right to be with him.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.781
He's an adult under the law, and in
point of fact, you don't have that right.

23:02.855 --> 23:04.229
Do you want me
to go over your head?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.143
I'm not some college provost
you can intimidate with threats.

23:07.206 --> 23:09.759
Now you wanna gun for me, sir,
you give it your best shot.

23:09.831 --> 23:12.352
But it won't help
your son one damn bit.

23:19.559 --> 23:21.566
You have children, Captain?

23:21.958 --> 23:22.907
No.

23:23.143 --> 23:26.175
I just want him to know that he
doesn't have to go through this alone.

23:26.247 --> 23:27.807
Then be there for him.

23:28.039 --> 23:31.037
But in the eyes of the law, Joe is
responsible for his own actions...

23:31.110 --> 23:34.241
and this time, he's gonna have
to stand on his own two feet.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.827
The eyedropper
was a cute idea.

23:41.222 --> 23:42.432
It's not mine.

23:42.503 --> 23:44.891
Then how did it
end up in your waste basket?

23:45.030 --> 23:48.030
I have no idea.
And the girl's underwear?

23:48.870 --> 23:52.797
I already told you that she slept in
my bed. And her blood on your sheets?

23:54.342 --> 23:55.324
I can't help you.

23:55.398 --> 23:57.219
The urine sample
you gave already has.

23:57.285 --> 23:59.260
It tested positive
for gonorrhea.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.116
What? No.

24:02.054 --> 24:04.987
No, I don't have gonorrhea.
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

24:05.157 --> 24:07.295
And since Kelly was a virgin
before you raped her...

24:07.366 --> 24:09.820
we know that she got it from
you. Circumstantial, at best.

24:09.894 --> 24:11.323
It's good enough
for an indictment.

24:11.397 --> 24:13.667
And if his DNA matches
the semen from the rape kit...

24:13.733 --> 24:16.515
he'll be transferring to a campus
upstate. You understand that?

24:16.580 --> 24:19.002
Assuming you can get a court
order for the blood test.

24:19.078 --> 24:21.346
Please. We both know that
that's just a formality.

24:21.414 --> 24:22.755
Nevertheless...

24:22.821 --> 24:26.814
we'll wait for the results of that
formality before responding to your charges.

24:26.884 --> 24:27.832
Let's go.

24:28.004 --> 24:30.110
Possession of GHB is
a schedule one offense.

24:30.181 --> 24:32.636
With your past record...
What past record?

24:32.708 --> 24:34.978
The juvie hit for
possession of ecstasy.

24:35.428 --> 24:39.422
That record was expunged after my
client finished his community service.

24:39.493 --> 24:43.137
It was expunged on the condition that
he keep his nose clean until he was 21.

24:43.203 --> 24:44.348
Your client's only 19.

24:44.419 --> 24:46.908
We'll start with possession,
move to acting in concert...

24:46.980 --> 24:48.442
top it off with rape.

24:48.515 --> 24:50.371
Wait a minute.
Enough with the scare tactics.

24:50.435 --> 24:53.120
What are you offering?
What are you selling?

24:55.587 --> 24:58.436
I never saw the stuff.
How did it get in your room?

24:58.500 --> 24:59.482
I don't know.

24:59.556 --> 25:01.760
But Tess and Jodie were
acting weird all night.

25:02.563 --> 25:05.433
They kept topping off Kelly's
beer, and calling it a love potion.

25:05.508 --> 25:07.646
I thought they were just
trying to get her drunk.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.570
Is your roommate in on this?

25:11.555 --> 25:12.503
Yeah.

25:13.956 --> 25:15.679
All I know is...

25:16.420 --> 25:17.532
after the girls left...

25:17.603 --> 25:20.570
Joe tossed me a blanket
and told me to hit the bricks.

25:20.643 --> 25:23.130
Said he was about to hit
another home run.

25:25.411 --> 25:28.161
According to Hank, Joe spent at
least a half hour alone with Kelly...

25:28.226 --> 25:29.721
before he went
downstairs to crash.

25:29.794 --> 25:33.056
His statement also implies a conspiracy
between Kelly's sorority sisters...

25:33.122 --> 25:34.846
for which we have no motive
and no proof.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.336
Why would her own sorority
sisters set her up to be raped?

25:37.411 --> 25:39.167
Exactly what
the grand jury's gonna ask.

25:39.234 --> 25:41.787
We don't supply an answer,
our whole case looks suspect.

25:41.859 --> 25:42.873
If they are involved...

25:42.947 --> 25:45.729
Tess and Jodie are not gonna be
very forthcoming with a motive.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.736
But I know someone who might.

25:49.667 --> 25:52.383
Kelly and Tess didn't get
along very well at first.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.134
In fact, Tess tried to get
Kelly dinged during pledge week.

25:55.202 --> 25:56.183
"Dinged"?

25:56.258 --> 25:58.495
Rejected by the membership.
Why?

26:01.026 --> 26:04.473
Look, Dana, I understand that
your sisters are pressuring you...

26:04.546 --> 26:06.750
but your friend was
drugged and raped.

26:06.818 --> 26:08.760
Now you need to decide
what's more important...

26:08.835 --> 26:11.452
living with them,
or living with yourself.

26:13.249 --> 26:15.616
Joe and Tess
were dating last semester.

26:16.002 --> 26:17.857
Kelly was new.
She didn't know.

26:17.922 --> 26:20.857
When Joe checked her out at a
rush party, she flirted back.

26:20.929 --> 26:22.937
Tess was furious.

26:23.266 --> 26:25.175
When Joe dumped her,
she blamed Kelly.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.966
Tess the type of person
to hold a grudge?

26:28.386 --> 26:31.287
A few weeks ago, I heard her
and Jodie in the bathroom.

26:31.362 --> 26:33.303
Tess found out
she had the clap.

26:33.378 --> 26:34.838
She get it from Joe?

26:35.201 --> 26:36.347
They were whispering.

26:36.417 --> 26:38.872
All I heard was something
about getting even.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.920
Things got a little strange
after that.

26:40.994 --> 26:42.967
She started acting
really friendly towards Kelly.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.278
You know, even offered
to be her big sister.

26:45.345 --> 26:47.254
But behind her back,
she was spreading rumors...

26:47.329 --> 26:49.085
about Kelly and how
she was sleeping around.

26:49.153 --> 26:51.292
Tess ever mentioned anything
about drugs?

26:51.361 --> 26:52.343
No.

26:52.417 --> 26:55.199
Did you ever see her or Jodie
handling a clear substance...

26:55.264 --> 26:56.922
possibly in an eyedropper?

26:57.760 --> 27:00.281
I saw them mixing chemicals
in their room.

27:01.985 --> 27:03.195
When was that?

27:04.193 --> 27:05.883
The night before
they went out.

27:05.953 --> 27:07.065
It looked like homework.

27:07.136 --> 27:09.919
Tess was reading
from her biochem notebook.

27:15.265 --> 27:17.336
That's Tess's station.
Open it.

27:22.496 --> 27:23.990
Bag everything.

27:25.087 --> 27:26.462
What are you doing?

27:26.528 --> 27:28.437
Lab TA said some items
are missing from storage,

27:28.512 --> 27:30.105
we thought they might
have been...

27:30.176 --> 27:33.404
misplaced in your drawer here.
Perhaps you could save us the trouble.

27:40.447 --> 27:43.163
You been out for a little jog?
What are you doing in my room?

27:43.230 --> 27:45.304
It's all in the warrant.

27:45.375 --> 27:47.416
This is harassment.
So sue me.

27:47.487 --> 27:49.429
You're a biochem major, aren't you? So?

27:49.504 --> 27:53.693
So, how about educating us to what the
scientific name for this little formula is?

27:54.911 --> 27:56.088
Well?

27:57.118 --> 28:00.501
Tess, possession is
just the beginning.

28:00.575 --> 28:02.964
Now we prove conspiracy,
you're looking at rape.

28:03.038 --> 28:05.689
Rape? You took away
her ability to consent.

28:05.758 --> 28:07.319
You'll never prove that.
No?

28:07.391 --> 28:10.554
One of your sorority sisters already
decided to break the code of silence.

28:10.623 --> 28:13.492
Told us how Joe gave you the clap
before he dumped you for Kelly.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.086
I mean, what better way to
get back at the little tease...

28:16.159 --> 28:18.810
than making sure she paid
full freight for the ride?

28:18.879 --> 28:21.300
And GHB was the ticket.
We traced the chemicals...

28:21.373 --> 28:22.651
we know where
you mixed them.

28:22.718 --> 28:24.857
All we have to do is execute
another search warrant...

28:24.926 --> 28:26.616
and we're gonna have more than
what we need...

28:26.686 --> 28:29.719
to put you and your accomplice
away for a very long time.

28:30.782 --> 28:33.848
I better call a lawyer.
Be my guest.

28:47.133 --> 28:50.168
You think she'll take the
bait? We'll know soon enough.

28:51.934 --> 28:52.949
Okay.

29:22.973 --> 29:23.920
You bitch.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.065
Prison is no sorority, Jodie.

29:31.132 --> 29:34.034
On the bright side, you
still might be young enough...

29:34.108 --> 29:36.759
to have kids when you get out.
You don't scare me.

29:36.829 --> 29:40.089
What if I told you we have enough
evidence to send you to prison?

29:40.157 --> 29:41.650
My father would
never let that happen.

29:41.724 --> 29:45.020
Your fingerprints on the eyedropper.
Daddy can't help you with that.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.670
Look, Jodie,
I was in a sorority, too.

29:47.740 --> 29:50.740
I understand that the bonds
of sisterhood run very deep.

29:51.515 --> 29:53.555
But Tess sold you out.

29:53.627 --> 29:54.576
She would never do that.

29:54.651 --> 29:56.985
She made a phone call
that put you in the basement.

29:57.052 --> 29:59.386
We know she was the one
who had the beef with Kelly.

29:59.452 --> 30:02.102
You just did the dirty
work for her. Look...

30:02.491 --> 30:03.735
you tell us the truth...

30:03.804 --> 30:07.152
and we'll try to convince the DA to
take your cooperation into consideration.

30:07.227 --> 30:08.688
You don't know Tess.

30:08.987 --> 30:10.775
If she did that to Kelly...

30:11.899 --> 30:14.321
I'm James Woodrow,
Miss Tomlinson's lawyer.

30:14.395 --> 30:17.296
Her father, Justice Tomlinson,
sends his regards.

30:17.371 --> 30:20.405
And meanwhile, my client is
invoking her constitutional right...

30:20.475 --> 30:22.515
to keep her mouth shut.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.517
Jodie's lawyer
has pulled the plug.

30:26.587 --> 30:29.455
I think he'll reconsider, once he
and her father see the evidence.

30:29.531 --> 30:33.426
At least we've got them on possession,
possibly rape three, acting in concert.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.545
Now the bad news.

30:34.619 --> 30:37.651
Joe's and Hank's DNA don't match
the semen from the rape kit.

30:37.723 --> 30:40.439
Are you sure?
Lab checked it twice.

30:40.762 --> 30:43.512
So we got a rape, but we
still don't have a rapist.

30:43.579 --> 30:45.650
What about Joe? Doesn't
the clap implicate him?

30:45.721 --> 30:48.918
Gonorrhea cannot be genetically
traced. So without the DNA...

30:48.987 --> 30:50.262
This is interesting.

30:50.331 --> 30:52.850
Remember that ugly scarf with
all the little fish on it?

30:52.922 --> 30:54.329
The one they found
in the bushes?

30:54.394 --> 30:56.466
Lab lifted two distinct
hair fibers from it.

30:56.537 --> 30:59.287
One belongs to Kelly,
the other matches the semen.

31:00.634 --> 31:02.040
Looks familiar.

31:02.392 --> 31:03.702
We found it where you fell.

31:03.770 --> 31:06.552
There were hairs on it belonging
to you and another person.

31:06.618 --> 31:09.073
The guy who raped me?
That's what we believe.

31:09.145 --> 31:12.528
Think hard, Kelly.
This is a very unusual scarf.

31:18.074 --> 31:20.626
You frat boys
and your nicknames.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.813
Walleye. That's a kind
of fish, isn't it?

31:34.265 --> 31:37.015
That wasn't a very bright
move, giving Kelly your scarf.

31:37.081 --> 31:39.153
I didn't.
You saying she stole it?

31:39.449 --> 31:41.271
She must have.

31:41.497 --> 31:43.504
From where?
I don't know.

31:43.576 --> 31:45.266
You don't know
where you keep your clothes?

31:45.337 --> 31:46.514
I don't know how she got it.

31:46.585 --> 31:49.651
Why don't we try and figure that one
out? You said you were in Joe's room.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.438
I left to study.
I meant later...

31:52.985 --> 31:55.439
when you found Kelly alone.

31:55.513 --> 31:59.855
Like I said, I offered to walk
her home, but she left without me.

32:07.288 --> 32:11.346
The hair fibers on the scarf, match
the semen that you left on Kelly.

32:14.903 --> 32:16.627
Why'd you lie, Wally?

32:23.511 --> 32:25.781
When I saw her
sitting there...

32:26.552 --> 32:28.439
she looked so sad.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.246
I took her to my room...

32:31.607 --> 32:34.543
and I brushed the hair
back from her face.

32:35.992 --> 32:37.900
And for the first time...

32:38.743 --> 32:42.998
she looked at me
like she actually saw me.

32:45.495 --> 32:47.382
And we sat on my bed...

32:48.183 --> 32:49.677
and talked...

32:50.743 --> 32:52.652
and then she kissed me.

32:54.678 --> 32:55.627
And...

32:56.246 --> 32:58.069
the rest just happened.

33:00.087 --> 33:02.934
I didn't know she was drugged.

33:03.638 --> 33:06.060
I thought she wanted
to be with me.

33:11.029 --> 33:13.648
It doesn't matter if Wally
knew, it's rape by statute.

33:13.718 --> 33:15.506
Could we offer him a deal?

33:15.574 --> 33:19.502
His DNA is the only concrete evidence
we have linking rapist to victim.

33:19.573 --> 33:22.922
I can't afford to compromise my case
against the others by dealing him out.

33:22.998 --> 33:24.820
Yet, somehow that
does not seem right.

33:24.886 --> 33:27.122
The kid goes down
because he misread signals?

33:27.190 --> 33:29.972
If we offer him a deal, we send
mixed signals to the grand jury.

33:30.038 --> 33:32.459
I can't ask them to indict
the sorority sisters on rape...

33:32.534 --> 33:33.843
without offering up a rapist.

33:33.909 --> 33:36.725
The case against Joe that
shaky? It's circumstantial.

33:36.789 --> 33:39.540
By itself, it's probably not
enough to secure an indictment...

33:39.606 --> 33:40.587
for acting in concert.

33:40.661 --> 33:43.443
You mean, after all this,
there's a chance Joe could walk?

33:43.510 --> 33:46.193
Which is why we can't afford
to lose Wally as a defendant.

33:46.262 --> 33:48.333
If we can secure indictments
across the board...

33:48.405 --> 33:50.674
I might be in a position to
offer him a lesser charge...

33:50.740 --> 33:52.366
in exchange for his testimony.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.109
I'm nervous.

34:00.469 --> 34:02.540
You're gonna do fine.
Just listen to Alex.

34:02.613 --> 34:05.483
She'll guide you through
the testimony, step by step.

34:05.747 --> 34:07.341
Will any of them
be in the room?

34:07.412 --> 34:09.900
No. Just you, Alex,
and the grand jury.

34:11.253 --> 34:14.003
I hope I'm doing the right
thing. Kelly, you are.

34:14.197 --> 34:16.813
I still can't remember anything.
What if they don't believe me?

34:16.885 --> 34:18.292
Just tell them what you know.

34:18.356 --> 34:21.138
The other witnesses
will tell them the rest.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.409
Ready?

34:25.299 --> 34:26.248
Kelly?

34:26.837 --> 34:29.170
I thought you said
they wouldn't be here.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.309
They won't be inside.
I promise.

34:32.788 --> 34:36.399
I was lying on my back
in the hospital, shaking.

34:37.268 --> 34:39.340
The doctor told me...

34:40.306 --> 34:41.868
I'd been raped.

34:43.411 --> 34:44.841
I was scared.

34:46.099 --> 34:48.717
It's like someone stealing
a piece of your soul.

34:49.364 --> 34:52.679
And even when you find out
who, and how...

34:52.755 --> 34:54.860
you can never get it back.

34:54.931 --> 34:57.233
I may not remember
that night...

34:58.163 --> 35:00.814
but I do remember
my life before it...

35:03.539 --> 35:05.776
and I'll never be
that person again.

35:07.251 --> 35:09.520
GHB acts as an intoxicant...

35:09.587 --> 35:13.416
depressing one's inhibitions
and making one extremely pliable.

35:13.490 --> 35:15.313
Does the drug affect
one's memory?

35:15.378 --> 35:19.153
In nearly all cases, the victim
suffers permanent short-term amnesia.

35:19.219 --> 35:22.153
We found a notebook
belonging to Tess Michner.

35:22.323 --> 35:25.802
Underneath the heading "Love
potion," was a formula for GHB...

35:25.874 --> 35:30.382
which exactly matched the GHB
found in Kelly D'leah's blood.

35:30.803 --> 35:32.395
Now, a few days later...

35:32.882 --> 35:35.435
base chemicals were discovered
in the sorority basement...

35:35.506 --> 35:38.224
and fingerprints
subsequently tied...

35:38.290 --> 35:41.421
Tess Michner and Jodie
Tomlinson to the containers.

35:41.714 --> 35:44.234
I saw Tess and Jodie
mixing chemicals...

35:44.434 --> 35:47.531
in their bedroom the night
before they went out with Kelly.

35:47.602 --> 35:50.352
What were they mixing?
I don't know.

35:50.674 --> 35:52.615
But they called it
a love potion.

35:52.690 --> 35:55.407
They kept laughing and filling
Kelly's glass.

35:55.474 --> 35:56.903
Did Joe say anything to you

35:56.978 --> 35:58.700
when he sent you
from the room?

35:59.954 --> 36:02.059
That he was going
to hit a home run.

36:02.225 --> 36:04.778
And who was in the room
when you left?

36:06.929 --> 36:08.336
Just Joe and Kelly.

36:08.498 --> 36:12.425
The examination revealed a torn hymen,
semen, and the presence of gonorrhea.

36:12.785 --> 36:15.153
Can gonorrhea be transmitted
without leaving semen?

36:15.217 --> 36:17.770
Yes, if the individual
penetrates without ejaculating.

36:17.841 --> 36:21.102
DNA analysis matched
the semen to Wallace Parker.

36:21.169 --> 36:25.609
However, that semen was free of gonorrhea.
What does that suggest to you, doctor?

36:25.681 --> 36:28.070
Someone else
infected Kelly D'leah.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.861
We discovered underwear stuffed
between Joe's bed and wall.

36:30.929 --> 36:33.384
Blood spots on his sheets
also belonged to Kelly D'leah.

36:33.457 --> 36:36.391
The crime lab analyzed a
sample of Joe Templeton's urine.

36:36.464 --> 36:39.812
What did they report? He
was infected with gonorrhea.

36:42.479 --> 36:43.658
How we doing?

36:44.176 --> 36:47.308
About as well as could be
expected. How are you holding up?

36:47.375 --> 36:49.317
All right, I guess.

36:49.392 --> 36:50.985
You wanted to see us?

36:51.215 --> 36:53.703
Wally's lawyer served us
with a cross 190.50.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.142
What's that?

36:55.216 --> 36:56.906
It means that Wally is
exercising his right

36:56.975 --> 36:59.080
to testify in front
of a grand jury.

36:59.151 --> 37:01.191
What's he have to say?
I don't know.

37:01.264 --> 37:03.174
I was hoping
you could tell me.

37:03.728 --> 37:05.669
I told you,
I don't remember anything.

37:05.744 --> 37:08.362
I don't think Wally's lawyer would
risk a grand jury appearance...

37:08.431 --> 37:10.920
if he didn't think his client
could be persuasive in an argument.

37:10.991 --> 37:13.032
A DNA match
will make anyone desperate.

37:13.136 --> 37:15.437
Unless there's
a mitigating explanation.

37:16.048 --> 37:18.502
Can you think of anything that
might have happened that night...

37:18.576 --> 37:20.363
to lead Wally to believe
his advances were welcomed?

37:20.431 --> 37:22.089
Anything that might be
construed as consent?

37:22.159 --> 37:25.094
I can't remember. Okay,
what about before that night?

37:26.351 --> 37:27.692
Think hard, Kelly.

37:27.823 --> 37:30.922
Did you ever flirt with
him even just a little? No.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.662
Well, maybe.

37:36.398 --> 37:37.347
Tell me.

37:38.703 --> 37:40.842
We had a couple classes
together.

37:40.911 --> 37:42.372
He was a whiz
at the classics...

37:42.447 --> 37:46.025
so I invited him for coffee a few
times afterward just to pick his brain.

37:46.095 --> 37:48.460
You know... And yes, I
knew he had a crush on me...

37:48.527 --> 37:51.973
but I never... What? That
doesn't mean I'm a slut.

37:52.047 --> 37:53.705
Kelly, we know.

37:53.774 --> 37:56.709
It's just, it might give them the
ammunition they need to plead innocent.

37:56.782 --> 37:59.400
I knew I shouldn't have
gone through with this.

37:59.790 --> 38:02.692
Okay. So what can you do?
Well...

38:03.118 --> 38:06.052
after he makes his statement,
I get to cross examine him.

38:06.126 --> 38:08.362
Don't worry,
I'll go after him.

38:11.566 --> 38:13.190
It began as a friendship...

38:13.262 --> 38:15.628
and became something more,
that night.

38:16.238 --> 38:17.896
We had sex.

38:18.318 --> 38:22.442
But I didn't know she was
drugged. I swear, I didn't know.

38:24.333 --> 38:27.978
Mr. Parker, just a couple of
questions for clarification.

38:29.102 --> 38:32.362
You saw the vomit on the floor. Yes.

38:33.325 --> 38:36.042
You saw her disheveled appearance. Yes.

38:36.108 --> 38:38.629
Her matted hair, the watering eyes. Yes.

38:39.245 --> 38:41.633
And you still didn't know
she was under the influence...

38:41.709 --> 38:44.938
when you asked her into your
room? I thought she was tired.

38:45.005 --> 38:47.721
Tired?
Upset, maybe.

38:48.429 --> 38:50.087
She looked sad.

38:50.285 --> 38:52.870
And you took that as
an invitation to have sex?

38:53.293 --> 38:55.016
No, I mean...

38:55.084 --> 38:57.507
Did she say she wanted
to have sex with you?

38:58.796 --> 39:01.252
She flirted with me.
When?

39:01.324 --> 39:03.811
In class, at the coffee shop.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.569
Did she say she wanted to
have sex with you then?

39:07.436 --> 39:08.384
No.

39:08.460 --> 39:09.988
Did she say she
wanted to have sex with you...

39:10.059 --> 39:13.540
the night that you took her into
your room? She didn't have to.

39:14.413 --> 39:16.102
I'll take that as a no.

39:18.188 --> 39:19.268
She kissed me.

39:19.340 --> 39:22.122
And you took that kiss as
the green light to go ahead?

39:22.187 --> 39:23.748
She never said no.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.958
Her shirt was stained
with vomit...

39:26.026 --> 39:28.777
her hair was matted,
her eyes were blurry...

39:28.844 --> 39:31.659
and you still thought
she wanted to have sex?

39:32.268 --> 39:33.315
Yes.

39:34.443 --> 39:37.030
I guess it was just
your lucky night.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.554
What is taking so long?

39:44.618 --> 39:46.145
Don't read too much into it.

39:46.219 --> 39:48.129
They have a lot of evidence
to sift through...

39:48.203 --> 39:50.625
a lot of testimony
to consider.

40:06.251 --> 40:07.199
Hey.

40:08.395 --> 40:09.343
So?

40:09.899 --> 40:12.965
The grand jury indicted Tess
and Jodie on possession...

40:14.315 --> 40:17.282
but they didn't return charges
against Wally or Joe.

40:17.642 --> 40:19.747
They're saying I wasn't raped?

40:19.819 --> 40:22.753
But what about the semen,
the gonorrhea, the hickeys?

40:22.827 --> 40:26.241
Apparently, the grand jury
split on the issue of consent...

40:26.314 --> 40:30.951
they believed that you were drugged, but
they didn't believe that the guys knew.

40:31.049 --> 40:33.897
On the other hand,
the dean expelled them all.

40:36.170 --> 40:38.079
Hardly seems worth it.

40:39.050 --> 40:42.082
Kelly, you did
the right thing.

40:45.322 --> 40:47.777
I never took those pills
the doctor gave me.

40:47.849 --> 40:50.239
I don't know why,
but I just... I couldn't.

40:50.601 --> 40:52.456
What if I'm pregnant?

40:54.762 --> 40:57.183
I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

40:57.514 --> 40:59.717
What about my parents?

41:01.610 --> 41:03.584
I haven't told them yet.

41:06.761 --> 41:08.254
Might be a good time, huh?
