WEBVTT

00:02.445 --> 00:05.754
- Happy Turkey Day.
- Yes! Right out of the gate.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.089
What?
What's going on?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.957
We're playing Boyle Bingo,
Thanksgiving edition.

00:08.991 --> 00:12.460
Everyone filled out their cards with
possible Charles-related scenarios.

00:12.495 --> 00:13.995
First to bingo
gets 100 bucks.

00:14.030 --> 00:17.166
I had "Boyle calls it 'Turkey Day'"
on the center square.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.836
"Boyle explains that they ate
lobsters at the first Thanksgiving."

00:20.870 --> 00:23.738
They did. Back in that time,
they called lobsters "ocean bugs."

00:23.739 --> 00:26.141
- And... I'll just mark it off for you.
- I think got the winning card here.

00:26.175 --> 00:29.044
Boyle tells us that he played
Pocahontas in his third grade play.

00:29.078 --> 00:30.379
All the girls were too big.

00:30.413 --> 00:33.542
This is a fun one... "Boyle says,
'Gobble, gobble, gobble.'"

00:33.549 --> 00:35.150
Well, now that I know
you want me to say that,

00:35.184 --> 00:37.052
I'll just say it
with two gobbles.

00:37.086 --> 00:39.154
Gobble, gobble...

00:39.722 --> 00:42.290
Gobble. God, it just
sounds right that way.

00:42.324 --> 00:43.658
Ugh. I don't like
this game.

00:43.692 --> 00:45.994
Ha! "Boyle objects
to Boyle Bingo."

00:46.028 --> 00:48.296
- Come on, guys.
- Boyle says, "Come on, guys."

00:48.330 --> 00:49.631
That's two for Terry.

00:49.665 --> 00:51.533
Well, guess what.
I can spoil your little game

00:51.567 --> 00:54.802
by sitting over here quietly
all day and doing nothing.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.901
- Oh!
- Aah!

00:56.902 --> 00:58.706
Anybody have "Boyle falls
on the floor?"

00:58.740 --> 01:00.841
- No one?
- That's a victory.

01:00.876 --> 01:02.943
That's a victory for Boyle.
Boom!

01:02.977 --> 01:04.811
Boyle says, "Boom!"

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:24.066 --> 01:25.901
Check it out, chair jockeys.

01:25.935 --> 01:30.138
While you were busy tickling the ivories
on your computers, I was doing a bust.

01:30.172 --> 01:31.940
Cocaine!

01:31.974 --> 01:33.274
Thanks, Lucius.

01:33.309 --> 01:35.610
He ran, I pursued.

01:35.645 --> 01:38.046
Whole thing turned into
an awesome car chase.

01:39.815 --> 01:42.050
- Aah.
- NYPD!

01:46.222 --> 01:48.390
Come on.
Move, move, move.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.939
Hey there, criminal.
It's me, Johnny Law.

01:51.973 --> 01:53.607
Well, at least
you're done early,

01:53.642 --> 01:56.444
so you have time to go home and
change for my Thanksgiving dinner.

01:56.445 --> 01:58.427
Ugh. Why do we have
to dress up for Thanksgiving.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.402
I don't even
celebrate that stuff.

02:00.437 --> 02:01.771
The whole holiday is
based on overeating.

02:01.805 --> 02:04.206
We should be wearing
velvet track suits and diapers.

02:04.241 --> 02:05.508
Jacket and tie.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.743
Rosa's even wearing
her formal leather jacket.

02:07.778 --> 02:09.211
It's the one without
any blood on it.

02:09.246 --> 02:11.013
You're gonna dress up,
and you're gonna

02:11.048 --> 02:12.715
give a toast about
what you're thankful for.

02:12.749 --> 02:13.816
Start preparing.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.785
Oh, I prefer not
to prepare for my toasts.

02:15.819 --> 02:17.720
I just wing 'em
like scat jazz.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.958
- Are we singing?
- No, no, no, no.

02:23.801 --> 02:26.463
OK... That's nice.

02:26.497 --> 02:29.099
You don't have to...

02:29.133 --> 02:31.468
I'm not
dressing up for your party.

02:33.345 --> 02:36.140
Damn it, Boyle.
You left the fridge open.

02:36.141 --> 02:38.475
The door couldn't shut
because of your empty pizza box.

02:38.476 --> 02:42.182
Pizza? Please. This is a butternut
squash and truffle butter flatbread.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.614
Everything's spoiled.
My lunch is ruined.

02:44.649 --> 02:50.354
My chicken, my potatoes,
my pasta, my meatballs,

02:50.388 --> 02:53.190
ham, my yogurt.

02:53.225 --> 02:55.316
- Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
- I love yogurt.

02:55.327 --> 02:57.828
So this is your lunch
for, like, the month?

02:57.862 --> 03:01.097
I need to eat 10,000 calories a day
to maintain muscle mass.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.799
My wife made me all of this before
she left town with the kids.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.568
That was everything
in my fridge.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.170
- Scully.
- Hey-a, Sarge.

03:08.205 --> 03:10.139
I know you got a secret stash
of food hidden somewhere.

03:10.173 --> 03:11.440
- Oh, no.
- Where is it?

03:11.475 --> 03:13.443
- No, I don't.
- Is it in your pockets?

03:13.477 --> 03:14.611
Oh, come on.

03:14.645 --> 03:16.979
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets.
Turn around.

03:17.014 --> 03:18.873
Sarge. Sarge!

03:18.874 --> 03:20.483
Go limp, Scully.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.151
This is fun.

03:22.185 --> 03:24.854
Release your sweets.

03:28.157 --> 03:29.825
Can I help you,
Santiago?

03:29.859 --> 03:33.028
Oh, Captain, didn't
expect to see you there.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.433
In my office?

03:34.434 --> 03:36.131
So, I just wanted
to make sure that

03:36.132 --> 03:39.402
you knew about the Thanksgiving dinner
I'm hosting for the squad after work.

03:39.403 --> 03:43.173
Yes, I received your "Save the date"
decorative gourd,

03:43.207 --> 03:45.742
your ornamental cornucopia,

03:45.776 --> 03:49.612
and this beautiful handcrafted card
of a turkey wearing a top hat.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.816
- It's a pilgrim's hat.
- Where's the buckle, Santiago?

03:52.850 --> 03:54.251
The buckle.

03:54.285 --> 03:58.455
My husband's out of town for work,
so of course I will attend your dinner.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.457
Cool. Whatever.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.826
Yeah, don't worry about it,
either way.

04:02.861 --> 04:04.921
It's not a big deal.

04:06.398 --> 04:08.263
- Yes!
- Why so excited?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.935
Did you make the cover of
"Hair Pulled Back" magazine?

04:10.969 --> 04:13.436
The captain is coming
to my party.

04:13.471 --> 04:17.440
I'm gonna give a toast, tell him how
thankful I am to have him in the precinct,

04:17.474 --> 04:19.709
and officially ask him
to be my mentor.

04:19.743 --> 04:23.012
Wait, are you only hosting dinner
because you wanna suck up to Holt?

04:23.047 --> 04:26.649
Not cool. This was supposed
to be about friendship.

04:26.684 --> 04:30.153
You said you were only coming to see if
my apartment was the reason I was single,

04:30.187 --> 04:32.489
or if it was my personality,
like you suspected.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.859
Yeah, but that was before I knew
I could get up on this high horse.

04:35.893 --> 04:37.327
Love the view up here.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.785
Clip clop, clip clop,
clip clop.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.367
Same to you, Your Honor.

04:43.402 --> 04:46.103
- Oh, what judge were you talking to?
- That was my mother.

04:46.104 --> 04:47.671
You call your mom
"Your Honor"?

04:47.705 --> 04:49.539
She's a federal judge
in the Ninth Circuit.

04:49.574 --> 04:51.484
- What else would I call her?
- Yeah, okay.

04:51.509 --> 04:54.344
Captain, paperwork is
all done on that drug bust.

04:54.379 --> 04:57.648
- What else you got for me?
- Nothing. All open cases are assigned.

04:57.682 --> 05:00.151
Come on, there's gotta be
something I can investigate.

05:00.185 --> 05:01.552
No, there's nothing.

05:01.586 --> 05:03.787
All right, well, when there's nothing,
there's nothing, you know? What can you...

05:03.822 --> 05:05.422
Whoa!
Who did that?

05:05.457 --> 05:08.559
Don't worry, sir. I will stay
here all night figuring this out.

05:08.593 --> 05:10.194
I know what you're
up to here, Peralta.

05:10.228 --> 05:12.996
Damn straight. I'm trying to catch
the mad paper scatterer.

05:13.031 --> 05:15.878
You want an excuse to skip
Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner,

05:15.879 --> 05:17.200
because for some reason,
you refuse

05:17.234 --> 05:19.202
to celebrate this holiday
like a normal person.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.338
Fine. You're right. I wanna do
what I do every year -

05:21.372 --> 05:24.166
Sit at home, watch football,
and eat mayo nut spoonsies.

05:24.323 --> 05:27.121
Those are spoonfuls of mayo,
sprinkled with peanuts.

05:27.122 --> 05:28.317
That's revolting.

05:28.318 --> 05:30.339
Maybe so, but it's what
I invented when I was six

05:30.340 --> 05:32.615
because my mom was working,
so I had to make dinner for myself.

05:32.649 --> 05:34.550
My sad story
trumps your insult.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.985
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

05:36.019 --> 05:37.520
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

05:37.554 --> 05:38.754
Thank you, Boyle.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.522
If a case opens up,
it's yours.

05:40.557 --> 05:45.594
But if not, you will be at Santiago's
as a professional courtesy. Dismissed.

05:45.628 --> 05:48.930
From what?
I thought we were just chatting.

05:48.965 --> 05:51.733
We never chat anymore.

05:53.059 --> 05:56.571
Oh, my God, Amy, that's so cool that
you still live with your grandmother.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.441
I live alone.
This is my stuff.

05:59.476 --> 06:03.304
- I like quilts.
- Stop. Each sentence is getting sadder.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.247
<i>It looks like you live
on the set of Murder, She Wrote.</i>

06:05.281 --> 06:07.916
Well, I gotta say, it's not as bad
as I thought it would be.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.153
I mean, the football game's not on,
so I can still watch it later at home.

06:11.187 --> 06:13.989
And it's kind of cool to visit a time
before electricity was invented.

06:14.024 --> 06:16.024
I have to practice my toast.

06:16.059 --> 06:18.093
- God, how long is that?
- Eight pages.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.661
- Single-spaced?
- Double-sided.

06:19.695 --> 06:21.062
- Santiago style.
- Mm-hmm.

06:21.097 --> 06:23.031
Hey, excuse me.
Can we please eat?

06:23.065 --> 06:25.667
My body is starting
to digest itself.

06:25.701 --> 06:27.702
Terry needs nutrients.

06:27.737 --> 06:29.537
No eating until
the captain gets here.

06:29.538 --> 06:32.238
- Okay? Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

06:32.239 --> 06:35.075
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving
at your house than with my sister.

06:35.076 --> 06:36.977
"Things you find
a the beach."

06:37.011 --> 06:39.926
- For "S", I had seagull.
- Good one, Diana!

06:39.927 --> 06:42.249
- Ice cream break.
- Yay!

06:42.283 --> 06:43.317
Yay.

06:43.351 --> 06:45.286
It's so pleasant and boring.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.488
But, Holt, at your house,
surrounded by these idiots?

06:47.523 --> 06:49.757
Guaranteed train wreck.
Thanks for the invite.

06:50.992 --> 06:53.761
He's here! Okay, he's here, everybody.
Be cool.

06:53.762 --> 06:55.363
Hitchcock, why do you
have your shirt off?

06:55.398 --> 06:57.699
Can't spill food on your shirt
if you're not wearing one.

06:57.734 --> 06:59.401
What...

07:00.803 --> 07:02.804
- Captain Holt.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

07:02.838 --> 07:04.839
Your apartment was
very easy to locate.

07:04.873 --> 07:08.670
Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.

07:09.778 --> 07:11.245
Weirdest conversation ever.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.514
Nice work, you two.

07:13.549 --> 07:15.884
Before we eat,
I'd like everyone

07:15.918 --> 07:18.520
to go around and say what
they're thankful for this year.

07:18.555 --> 07:20.623
Fine, I'll go first.

07:20.657 --> 07:23.927
I am thankful that Thanksgiving
only comes once a year.

07:23.961 --> 07:26.897
People stuff themselves,
and then at midnight they

07:26.931 --> 07:30.234
run to appliance stores
and trample each other to death.

07:30.268 --> 07:32.536
It's a garbage holiday.

07:32.570 --> 07:36.706
I'm sorry, I just get emotional when
I talk about how bogus Thanksgiving is.

07:36.741 --> 07:38.307
I'll just go.

07:38.342 --> 07:41.277
- I actually prepared a little something.
- You did?

07:41.311 --> 07:43.402
When I was a little girl,
playing cops and robbers...

07:43.413 --> 07:44.547
Excuse me.

07:44.581 --> 07:46.415
Please.
Continue, Santiago.

07:46.450 --> 07:48.548
- Or I could wait.
- No waiting, just toasting.

07:48.549 --> 07:50.286
I want you to toast.
Now I wanna eat toast.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.521
- Give me some toast!
- OK, I'll be right there.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.010
- I have to head back to the precinct.
- No. Why?

07:55.011 --> 07:57.146
Someone stole $10,000
from the evidence lockup.

07:57.328 --> 07:58.995
Yes!
Oh, awesome.

07:59.030 --> 08:00.697
- Why is that awesome?
- It's a case.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.432
You said I could
hop on any case that came up.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.734
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

08:04.769 --> 08:07.570
Have fun, you guys.
Let's roll!

08:09.373 --> 08:11.873
You'd think that one place money
would be safe is a police station.

08:11.874 --> 08:13.192
I hear that.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.787
Remember when Santiago
called you beautiful?

08:14.821 --> 08:16.628
Yes, that was odd.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.058
We need to get this money
back, the exact bills,

08:19.092 --> 08:21.391
so the commissioner's office
won't make our lives hell.

08:21.477 --> 08:22.719
What is this?

08:22.754 --> 08:24.421
Uh, this is Terry dancing.

08:24.456 --> 08:26.223
People do the weirdest stuff
in the evidence lockup

08:26.257 --> 08:27.590
when they think
no one's watching.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.393
Fast forward, fast forward,
fast forward.

08:30.428 --> 08:33.763
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
- Okay, so here's our money.

08:33.798 --> 08:35.063
Fast forward.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.967
Hold it,
hold it, go back.

08:38.001 --> 08:40.303
There's our guy.
Got him.

08:40.337 --> 08:42.373
Okay, we should start
by checking all the perps

08:42.407 --> 08:44.015
that were released
from holding today.

08:44.017 --> 08:46.310
- Good idea.
- And if it's none of them,

08:46.742 --> 08:48.910
we may miss Santiago's
altogether.

08:48.911 --> 08:51.048
Thanksgiving is dead!

08:51.082 --> 08:54.351
Santiago, can we please,
please just eat?

08:54.386 --> 08:56.120
What if captain Holt
and Jake are coming back?

08:56.154 --> 08:58.989
Hang on.
I have a toast.

08:59.023 --> 09:01.848
I am thankful to have someone
in my life

09:01.849 --> 09:04.405
who gives me a reason
to get out of bed every morning.

09:04.406 --> 09:07.797
And I hope that my relationship
with this person

09:07.831 --> 09:11.634
will only grow more intimate.

09:11.668 --> 09:13.609
Who are you talking about?

09:13.610 --> 09:17.479
Um, Hitchcock.

09:19.442 --> 09:21.977
OK, enough is enough.
I'm eatin'.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.349
What's in these?

09:27.383 --> 09:29.117
Potatoes, butter,
a little milk.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.420
Oh, and I ran out of salt,
so I used baking soda.

09:31.454 --> 09:33.055
Why wouldn't you?

09:33.089 --> 09:34.556
They're both white powders.

09:34.591 --> 09:36.525
Of course they're
interchangeable.

09:36.559 --> 09:38.126
Yeah.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.029
There were two men
released from holding today

09:42.064 --> 09:44.799
that were the right height and weight
to be our thief on the security footage.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.667
Even if it is one of them,
how will we know?

09:46.702 --> 09:48.583
Easy. The guy on the footage
was left-handed.

09:48.584 --> 09:50.967
We just give all of our suspects
some made-up form to sign,

09:50.968 --> 09:52.473
and see which hand they use.

09:52.507 --> 09:54.821
All right, amigo.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.878
Punch it.

09:59.983 --> 10:02.998
Good. Did that.
Now punch it.

10:03.920 --> 10:08.013
Uh-huh. Safety first.
Punch it!

10:10.527 --> 10:12.995
Okay, see, now I just feel like
you're messing with...

10:14.731 --> 10:17.433
- Anyone want seconds?
- Can't. I'm so stuffed.

10:17.467 --> 10:21.303
- Amy, the toilet's overflowing.
- What? Ew!

10:21.338 --> 10:23.072
Scully, what did you do?

10:23.106 --> 10:26.008
- And the night gets worse better.
- I didn't do it.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.843
Although, I understand
why you suspect me.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.828
Well, then who clogged it?

10:35.452 --> 10:37.720
So none of you ate anything?

10:37.755 --> 10:39.856
Terry, you said
you ate the whole turkey.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.090
Toilet.

10:44.027 --> 10:46.561
I ate one string bean.
It tasted like fish vomit.

10:46.596 --> 10:49.497
- That was it for me.
- But I'm a good cook.

10:49.531 --> 10:51.766
You all ate those brownies
I brought in last week.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.435
- I thought they were erasers.
- Charles said he loved them.

10:54.469 --> 10:57.004
I'm a textbook people-pleaser.
I have a serious problem.

10:57.038 --> 11:00.074
This was great though.
You must be so proud.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.988
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.958
Everybody go home. We're just...
We're done hanging out together.

11:04.992 --> 11:08.131
I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go
to the bar, they serve food there.

11:08.132 --> 11:10.464
- That's a great idea.
- Oh, look at that.

11:10.498 --> 11:12.265
"Boyle saves Thanksgiving."

11:12.300 --> 11:13.734
- Does it really say that?
- No.

11:13.768 --> 11:16.003
But it does say,
"Boyle believes obvious lie."

11:16.070 --> 11:17.704
Damn it.

11:17.738 --> 11:19.272
So what's our strategy here?

11:19.306 --> 11:21.507
I'm thinking maybe we could
do the whole thing in character.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.475
I'll play
detective Bart Barley...

11:23.510 --> 11:26.078
Tightly wound, hates
violence against animals.

11:26.079 --> 11:28.412
And you're my partner,
Gerald Jimes...

11:28.413 --> 11:31.150
A man who solved every crime,
but one...

11:31.151 --> 11:34.374
- The murder of his wife.
- Peralta, take this seriously.

11:34.396 --> 11:36.831
I am. As seriously
as you're taking the search

11:36.832 --> 11:38.724
for the man
who killed Jane Jimes.

11:38.758 --> 11:41.526
Your only clue?
He wore a yellow sweater.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.894
Eh?

11:42.928 --> 11:45.561
You're considering it.
Let's get in there.

11:46.231 --> 11:48.254
NYPD.

11:48.868 --> 11:51.257
What's going on? I'm right
in the middle of carving turkey.

11:51.258 --> 11:53.451
I'm vegetarian.
Eating meat is murder.

11:53.452 --> 11:56.375
- I hate violence against animals.
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.

11:56.409 --> 12:00.942
We overlooked our release form we were
supposed to have you sign. We apologize.

12:01.715 --> 12:04.316
Yeah, he's really right-handed.
Let's go.

12:04.350 --> 12:05.617
♪ Look out, bad guys

12:05.651 --> 12:07.385
♪ it's Barley and Jimes

12:07.420 --> 12:09.888
♪ Barley and Jimes
are on the case ♪

12:09.923 --> 12:12.593
Please refrain
from make believe this time.

12:12.594 --> 12:14.703
Fine.

12:14.878 --> 12:18.298
Evening, ma'am. NYPD.
Barley and Jimes.

12:18.332 --> 12:21.801
- We're looking for Donny Romano.
- Ugh. Come in.

12:21.836 --> 12:25.004
Donny, what'd you do?
Cops are here.

12:25.039 --> 12:26.506
Aww.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.291
What do you guys want?

12:28.292 --> 12:29.909
Sorry to bother you, sir,
my partner here

12:29.944 --> 12:31.534
forgot about a form
we need you to sign.

12:31.535 --> 12:33.473
What's happening, Donny?
What'd you do?

12:33.481 --> 12:35.798
I didn't do anything.
It's not my fault.

12:35.827 --> 12:38.429
- Same old story. It's never you, is it?
- What did Donny do?

12:38.455 --> 12:40.330
I swear, ma, I don't know
what this is about.

12:40.364 --> 12:43.400
- Why won't you ever believe me?
- 'Cause I raised a liar.

12:43.434 --> 12:45.435
- You lie.
- Shut up, ma.

12:45.470 --> 12:46.737
Hey, don't
talk to ma like that.

12:46.771 --> 12:48.739
Don't you tell me
what to do, Louie!

12:48.773 --> 12:49.973
Excuse me.

12:49.974 --> 12:50.974
- Hey!
- Not the rolls!

12:51.008 --> 12:52.242
George, do something.

12:52.276 --> 12:53.943
Excuse me, if...

12:55.346 --> 12:56.847
You know,
you're gonna get hurt.

12:56.881 --> 12:58.115
- Get off now.
- Get off.

12:58.149 --> 13:00.851
My wife was murdered by a man
in a yellow sweater!

13:01.330 --> 13:04.728
It's the one case
I can't solve.

13:05.401 --> 13:06.635
Don't fight with family.

13:06.857 --> 13:10.126
It can all go away
so quickly.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.828
Sign this?

13:17.071 --> 13:19.938
That's a hell of a breakthrough,
Jimes. I'm proud of you.

13:19.972 --> 13:23.208
Also, we just
caught our man.

13:23.242 --> 13:26.010
- He signed with his right hand.
- That's right, he did.

13:26.045 --> 13:27.445
But he didn't do it.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.046
- He did.
- What?

13:29.047 --> 13:31.816
Couldn't help but notice you throwing
those rolls with your left hand, boss.

13:31.850 --> 13:35.069
Not mention, this hoodie matches
our security footage exactly.

13:35.371 --> 13:36.922
You stole that money
when you came in to pick up

13:36.956 --> 13:38.524
your brother from holding
today, didn't you?

13:38.559 --> 13:40.527
- Damn it.
- Nice work, Peralta.

13:40.561 --> 13:43.029
- So where's the money now?
- It's not here, all right?

13:43.063 --> 13:44.063
I bet it all
on the football game.

13:44.097 --> 13:45.498
- My bookie has it.
- Yes!

13:45.532 --> 13:46.666
The case continues.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.036
- This is not good.
- Right. Sorry, Jimes.

13:50.070 --> 13:52.972
His father was murdered
by a bookie.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.007
I know you miss him.

13:59.162 --> 14:02.622
Our perp says the bookie operates
out of a hidden back room.

14:03.127 --> 14:04.928
- Try to blend in.
- Good idea.

14:04.929 --> 14:08.435
I'll just age myself 60 years,
become Chinese and female.

14:08.436 --> 14:10.271
Here we go. Whoosh.

14:10.451 --> 14:12.285
- Did it work?
- $10 to play.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.723
- Oh, we're just looking around.
- $40 just to look around.

14:15.758 --> 14:18.460
- All right, we'll play.
- $15 to play.

14:18.494 --> 14:19.895
All right.

14:21.397 --> 14:24.667
- Tommy, can we order some food?
- The cook's gone. I sent him home.

14:24.668 --> 14:27.059
- Do you have any more of these pretzels?
- Sure.

14:30.516 --> 14:33.193
- I'm gonna call the cook.
- Smart. Good call.

14:34.286 --> 14:36.187
Hey, rough night?

14:36.222 --> 14:39.324
Yeah, it certainly hasn't
gone according to plan.

14:39.358 --> 14:40.826
Aw, no. Aw, Amy,

14:40.860 --> 14:43.161
I was ordering a drink
called "A Rough Night."

14:43.195 --> 14:45.763
It's tequila
with a nicotine patch.

14:45.798 --> 14:47.532
Right.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.767
How do I get Holt
to pay attention to me?

14:49.802 --> 14:51.903
He sure spends a lot
of time on Peralta.

14:51.937 --> 14:54.939
Maybe I should start
screwing up, like Jake does.

14:54.973 --> 14:57.775
- I can act out too, you know?
- Please do.

14:57.810 --> 15:00.378
Okay. Watch this.

15:05.985 --> 15:07.018
Oops.

15:07.053 --> 15:09.555
Out...
All of you.

15:09.589 --> 15:11.824
- But the cook is coming back.
- Out!

15:13.573 --> 15:15.340
Fine!

15:15.828 --> 15:17.328
But I'm taking these olives.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.521
Sorry.
Happy Turkey Day.

15:26.906 --> 15:28.372
Ah.

15:28.407 --> 15:30.308
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

15:30.342 --> 15:33.778
These tiles are either
game pieces or candy.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.130
Game pieces. Here we go.

15:39.464 --> 15:41.249
I think I just won.

15:41.495 --> 15:44.343
The guy by the bathroom seems very
interested in the commotion you just made.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.912
Yeah, and he's been waiting
for the toilet since we got here.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.247
Ten-to-one that's not a bathroom,
and he's a lookout.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.479
- Let's go.
- You got it.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.618
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.799
- There is nothing here.
- Don't worry, guys, I found food.

16:02.122 --> 16:04.256
Are you eating
packing peanuts?

16:04.698 --> 16:07.433
Okay, I do keep a secret stash
of food in the office.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.363
I knew it!
Where?

16:09.364 --> 16:10.903
Where?

16:11.518 --> 16:14.172
- Sarge, am I too heavy?
- No. Where is it?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.975
- There, the one with the water stain.
- There's a lot of food up there?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.611
Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.889
- I think the rats got to it.
- You think?

16:29.923 --> 16:31.791
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.192
Okay, it's over.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.060
Thanksgiving time of death:
Now.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.742
No, this will not
be our Thanksgiving.

16:37.743 --> 16:39.310
All right,
you all wait here.

16:39.344 --> 16:41.846
Give me an hour.
Terry, to the door.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.214
I'm just gonna
put you down, man.

16:43.248 --> 16:45.476
Yeah, totally. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

16:45.484 --> 16:47.051
Hey, there.
Bathroom?

16:47.086 --> 16:48.820
There's another one upstairs,
over there.

16:48.854 --> 16:51.824
Aah. Oh!

16:54.461 --> 16:56.662
Oh. Never mind.
Let's go.

16:56.696 --> 16:58.464
- What, it's really a bathroom?
- No, no, no.

16:58.498 --> 17:00.532
There's tons of illegal stuff
happening in there.

17:00.566 --> 17:03.067
But they're watching the football
game and I DVR'd it.

17:03.102 --> 17:05.250
- I don't wanna see the score.
- What?

17:05.259 --> 17:07.359
Okay, fine.
We'll go get the stolen money.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.594
NYPD. Freeze.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.195
Change the channel
and then freeze.

17:10.231 --> 17:12.865
Put it down!

17:12.900 --> 17:14.200
Put it down,
put it down.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.868
This is a weird request, but
will you switch places with me?

17:16.904 --> 17:18.257
I really don't wanna
see the score.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.945
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
That's so much better. Oh!

17:26.980 --> 17:30.049
Why are there
so many TVs in here?

17:30.084 --> 17:31.284
Thank you.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.087
The money was still in the bookie's safe.
All the numbers match.

17:34.121 --> 17:37.090
- Let's head back to Santiago's party.
- Ah, no thanks.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.354
I think I'm gonna head home
and watch the football game,

17:39.355 --> 17:41.404
which was ruined for me!

17:41.405 --> 17:43.197
What's your problem
with celebrating Thanksgiving?

17:43.231 --> 17:45.478
It's a sucky holiday.
It's always sucked.

17:45.479 --> 17:49.047
My mom worked. My dad was gone.
And I sat at home, watching football.

17:49.082 --> 17:50.716
Look, Jake.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.085
I came from
a very formal family.

17:53.119 --> 17:55.520
My parents were not
especially affectionate.

17:55.554 --> 17:57.919
Really? "Your Honor"
wasn't a big snuggler?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.494
But the beauty of being an adult
is that you can make a new family

18:01.528 --> 18:03.306
with new traditions.

18:03.563 --> 18:06.042
Well, that's nice, captain, but
I don't have a new family yet,

18:06.043 --> 18:09.535
so I guess I'm stuck with
my awesome old traditions.

18:09.569 --> 18:12.337
Okay. I'll tell the squad
you couldn't make it.

18:12.371 --> 18:13.471
Thank you.

18:13.505 --> 18:15.439
Before you go,
can I borrow some money?

18:15.474 --> 18:17.775
I'm getting some pretty serious
vibes from Wendy over there,

18:17.810 --> 18:20.645
and I'd like to take her
someplace special.

18:25.584 --> 18:28.186
Hey. What are y'all
doing here?

18:28.221 --> 18:30.522
Amy broke everything and
got us kicked out of the bar.

18:30.556 --> 18:33.592
Then we got attacked by rats.
It's the best Thanksgiving ever.

18:33.626 --> 18:35.455
Fascinating.

18:35.456 --> 18:38.564
Happy Turkey Day.
Right through there, gentlemen.

18:38.598 --> 18:39.931
Not a lot of places
are open,

18:39.966 --> 18:43.335
so this will be a multiethnic,
nontraditional Thanksgiving.

18:43.369 --> 18:46.464
It's a real culinary challenge.
Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.

18:46.465 --> 18:47.588
Make it five.

18:47.589 --> 18:49.841
You eat with your eyes,
so the plating alone...

18:49.875 --> 18:52.277
Five, Boyle!

18:56.414 --> 18:57.547
- Captain?
- Hm?

18:57.582 --> 18:58.882
I wanna tell you something.

18:58.916 --> 19:01.284
I think you're...

19:01.319 --> 19:03.186
Like, when I was
a little girl...

19:03.221 --> 19:05.755
You think I'm like
when you were a little girl?

19:05.790 --> 19:09.250
- Forget it. The moment's passed.
- Is this about your toast?

19:10.161 --> 19:12.454
- How'd you get that?
- Gina gave it to me.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.755
It's very well-written.

19:13.789 --> 19:17.454
There are several compelling anecdotes.
The fonts suit the tone.

19:17.455 --> 19:18.855
Good work.

19:19.728 --> 19:22.930
I do feel, however, the word choice
could've been improved in spots.

19:22.965 --> 19:26.967
I marked them "Awk"
for "Awkward."

19:31.527 --> 19:33.462
That was the best thing
anyone's ever said to me.

19:33.496 --> 19:35.531
"I marked them 'Awk'
for 'Awkward'?"

19:35.565 --> 19:38.357
It's advice.
He's mentoring me.

19:38.456 --> 19:40.424
Yes!

19:41.037 --> 19:44.205
So this is kind of a play on your
typical Thanksgiving dinner.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.210
For turkey, we have the Peking duck
with a veggie samosa stuffing.

19:48.244 --> 19:52.814
The potatoes are the empanadas
with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy.

19:52.849 --> 19:55.483
And for dessert,
some seasonal gelatin cups.

19:55.517 --> 19:56.750
Okay, I ran out of money.

19:56.785 --> 19:58.319
They're from when Hitchcock
got his colonoscopy.

19:58.353 --> 19:59.887
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

19:59.921 --> 20:01.121
I'm here, I'm here.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.558
Finally something
to actually be thankful for.

20:04.592 --> 20:07.261
- What are you wearing?
- Santiago said to dress up, so...

20:07.295 --> 20:08.929
Well, you look beautiful.

20:08.964 --> 20:10.831
That's my thing now.
I'm just owning it.

20:10.866 --> 20:13.067
Okay. Before we eat...

20:13.101 --> 20:15.569
- Nope, not doing that again. Move.
- Could you pass the, uh...

20:15.604 --> 20:17.886
You get that hand near me again,
you're gonna lose it.

20:17.887 --> 20:20.522
Okey-doke, let's eat.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.943
Hey, thanks for giving a copy
of my toast to Holt.

20:22.978 --> 20:24.845
- That was nice of you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.981
I mean, you don't have to get
so freaked out around him.

20:27.015 --> 20:29.197
You were just trying
to tell him you respect him.

20:29.217 --> 20:30.685
Okay.

20:30.719 --> 20:33.256
But, to be honest, I kinda
gave it to him as a prank,

20:33.257 --> 20:35.624
'cause I thought it would be
super embarrassing for you.

20:35.658 --> 20:37.993
But I'm happy it worked out.

20:38.027 --> 20:40.836
But I would've been happy
if you hated it.

20:40.837 --> 20:42.922
But I'm happy you didn't.

20:43.183 --> 20:46.269
So, you pretty much got
the disaster night you were hoping for?

20:46.270 --> 20:49.634
Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving
meal I've ever had and ruined it.

20:51.285 --> 20:56.691
Excuse me! Uh, so, earlier at Amy's,
I didn't give a real toast because...

20:56.716 --> 20:58.136
I didn't know what to say.

20:58.161 --> 21:00.161
But, since that time,

21:00.186 --> 21:03.776
a wise, unsmiling man
named Gerald Jimes

21:03.801 --> 21:05.801
<i>made me realize
what I am thankful for.</i>

21:05.826 --> 21:09.738
So, I'd just like to say
I'm happy to be here...

21:09.763 --> 21:11.368
With my family.

21:11.393 --> 21:15.295
My super-weird family,
with two black dads and...

21:15.483 --> 21:18.867
Two Latina daughters
and two white sons and...

21:19.133 --> 21:21.133
Gina, and...

21:21.243 --> 21:24.629
I don't know what you are...
Some strange giant baby?

21:24.654 --> 21:27.588
- To the Nine-Nine!
- To the Nine-Nine!

21:27.613 --> 21:29.160
That was perfect.

21:29.185 --> 21:31.383
Uh, Boyle cries!
I got Boyle Bingo!

21:31.408 --> 21:33.408
- No...
- Yeah!

21:34.305 --> 21:40.802
