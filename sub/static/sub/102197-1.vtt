WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:04.238
(ethereal ominous music)

00:14.415 --> 00:17.085
- [Decker] Is the car there?

00:17.085 --> 00:18.819
This shouldn't take long.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.020
Keep your eyes open.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.655
This is Olivier
we're talking about.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.890
He's not to be trusted.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.629
- [Sasha] What do
you want me to say?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.566
- You understand?
- No.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.807
- They know, Sasha.
- So.

00:41.675 --> 00:42.943
- [Artemis] You have no idea

00:42.943 --> 00:43.911
what these people
will do to you.

00:43.911 --> 00:44.745
- I don't care.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.913
- I care.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.916
These people.

00:48.916 --> 00:52.052
(soft delicate music)

01:08.369 --> 01:09.203
I'm sorry.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.741
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:15.709 --> 01:16.544
I am.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.284
I have to.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.420
- It all meant nothing.

01:27.921 --> 01:28.922
Everything you said.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.394
Wow.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.630
(soft folk music)

01:36.630 --> 01:37.431
Fine.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.070
Just leave please.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.472
- [Artemis] I'm
trying to protect you.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.307
- Yeah, I don't need
your protection.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.743
I can protect myself.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.680
You're giving up on us.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.817
- It's the only way.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.051
- No, it's not.

02:04.124 --> 02:04.958
Fine.

02:07.060 --> 02:07.961
Just leave.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.866
Just leave, just
leave, just leave,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.504
just leave, just leave.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.473
- [Decker] Don't you think
it's time you let her go?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.643
(soft dramatic music)

02:37.358 --> 02:40.027
(phone ringing)

02:46.734 --> 02:47.568
- Anything?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.639
All right, stay on.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.674
As soon as you hear
anything you call me,

02:53.674 --> 02:54.508
you understand?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.710
Time is of the essence.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.082
Calling someone?

03:06.153 --> 03:07.421
It's about time to let that go.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.522
It's been long enough.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.392
Besides you got more
important matters

03:11.392 --> 03:12.526
to deal with right now.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.367
Where's Decker and your team?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.401
- Out of the country.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.737
- You sure about that?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.341
Decker's been acting
paranoid lately.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.579
- I'm sure about it.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.382
Right here.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.685
Dred's (muffled speaking)

03:37.685 --> 03:38.519
You come with me.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.889
Cash.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.725
(muffled speaking)

03:44.725 --> 03:45.726
Come join the party.

03:47.094 --> 03:47.928
Let's go.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.932
(door slamming)

04:07.147 --> 04:08.982
- What we have here
is a rendezvous.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.701
- How you doing, Max?

04:27.701 --> 04:28.869
You ready to go?
- Hold up a minute.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.439
- What?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.609
- Where you going?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.877
- Why?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.380
- Maybe I want to see
my grandson sometime.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.614
- I'll drop you a postcard.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.083
- I asked you
where you're going.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.252
I deserve an answer.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.354
- I lost all my money.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.858
Lives of some friends
and all I really want,

04:50.858 --> 04:53.160
you said you was gonna
give me back my son, Pop.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.164
(dog barking)

04:58.399 --> 04:59.633
You gotta forgive me.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.668
I just don't give
a damn what you

05:00.668 --> 05:02.135
think you deserve right now.

05:02.135 --> 05:02.970
- Son.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.773
You're not a killer.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.476
You think I'm after him.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.744
You won't be able to stop them.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.981
They'll take him and
we'll never see him again.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.915
- They won't.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.049
- They won't what, take him?

05:17.084 --> 05:20.988
(soft dramatic music)

05:20.988 --> 05:23.056
- You said you was gonna
give him back to me.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.091
You said, "Meet me at my house."

05:24.091 --> 05:25.192
- I know what I said.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.994
- You said--
- I know what I said,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.462
god dammit!

05:28.462 --> 05:30.263
- So what are we doing?

05:30.263 --> 05:34.101
(soft dramatic ominous music)

05:37.371 --> 05:39.507
- So you sure about this?

05:39.507 --> 05:40.408
- Positive.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.447
- Okay then.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.920
No more money, no
more protection.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.088
No nothing.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.290
For you or the boy.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.395
You made your bed
now you lie in it.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.866
(soft dramatic music)

06:18.612 --> 06:21.849
(background murmuring)

07:12.900 --> 07:16.236
(soft orchestral music)

07:26.947 --> 07:29.883
(soft piano music)

07:36.957 --> 07:38.091
- You mad at me?

07:40.928 --> 07:41.762
Still?

07:49.603 --> 07:52.072
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

07:55.108 --> 07:55.943
Hey!

08:05.152 --> 08:05.986
Sit down.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.425
Over here.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.564
(soft piano music)

08:25.472 --> 08:26.306
Hey.

08:34.314 --> 08:38.418
I ain't gonna leave you
there no more, I promise.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.223
I ain't gonna do it no more.

08:49.997 --> 08:50.831
- Promise?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.205
- I promise.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.817
(soft dramatic folk music)

09:14.722 --> 09:17.290
(cars beeping)

09:21.895 --> 09:24.197
- [Olivier] You made your
bed, now you lie in it.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.434
You made your bed,
now you lie in it.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.604
(soft dramatic music)

10:02.703 --> 10:04.304
(answering machine beeping)

10:04.304 --> 10:06.073
- [Man On Answering Machine]
(muffled speaking) punk.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.407
Bring him to me.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.814
(background murmuring)

10:23.857 --> 10:24.692
- Well?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.227
- It's him.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.228
- You sure about that?

10:29.396 --> 10:31.298
- As sure as I am that
the confederate flag

10:31.298 --> 10:33.767
no longer flies
in South Carolina.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.436
(both laughing)

10:37.637 --> 10:39.372
Look, I know this
must be hard for ya.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.408
He's gotta be stopped.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.679
Why don't you and the
boy get out of here?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.580
I'll track him down.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.816
I'll take care of him myself.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.818
- You don't even know
where he is, man.

10:52.152 --> 10:52.953
- I can find him.

10:53.887 --> 10:54.654
- When?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.597
- He can't hide here forever.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.902
- So you're gonna
meet him, alone?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.137
- What else?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.872
Gonna bring Dreds.

11:11.872 --> 11:12.906
- Dreds?

11:12.906 --> 11:13.807
Dreds is a baby.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.742
- He's a sniper.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.276
- He's barely off breast milk.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.812
- He's not that much
younger than you.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.213
- You better bring a
pacifier and a diaper bag,

11:20.213 --> 11:22.249
'cause that boy is
gonna poop in his pants.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.284
- He's the only guy I
can trust other than you.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.419
Plus he's--

11:26.419 --> 11:27.254
- Go ahead.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.356
You can say it.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.457
- He's a better shot.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.525
- You gotta be shitting me.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
One time in El Segundo.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.763
Other than that
I've been spot on.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.899
- It was that time.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.270
(laughs) Yeah.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.208
- Seriously, don't go.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.211
Nothing good could come of this.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.785
- I hear you.

11:57.785 --> 12:01.454
(dramatic suspenseful music)

12:17.838 --> 12:19.506
- [Decker] What's
taking him so long?

12:24.411 --> 12:27.014
- Welcome, welcome,
welcome to mi casa.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.952
(rhythmic electronic music)

12:43.730 --> 12:44.564
- Careful.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.899
Good to see you.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.501
Robin.
- Artemis.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.904
- Red.

12:50.904 --> 12:51.704
Decker.

12:55.008 --> 12:55.809
Talk to me.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.414
- So as you know,
Artemis, 10 years ago,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.318
we orchestrated a
coup in South Africa.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.824
We set aside $100,000,000
to help the transition.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.025
- [Artemis] Right.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.527
- We had two of our guys
secure the transfer.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.430
The following morning we
went to retrieve the money.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.498
We found our agent.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.332
- My friends,

13:22.602 --> 13:23.403
dead.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.440
(soft dramatic music)

13:27.440 --> 13:30.143
- This guy tied them up,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.579
took plastic bags and
placed them over their head

13:32.579 --> 13:34.514
and asked him for the money.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.316
And then when they
wouldn't give him the money

13:36.316 --> 13:38.018
he held them until
the passed out.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.324
- And when they finally broke,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.761
and they told him everything
that he wanted to know,

13:48.761 --> 13:51.398
he still killed them.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.735
(soft dramatic music)

13:56.769 --> 13:57.570
That is why

14:04.711 --> 14:07.480
I will not rest until
I find that money.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.216
(bag crinkling)

14:09.216 --> 14:10.050
- Jesus!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.988
(Robin screaming)

14:14.988 --> 14:15.822
Jesus Decker,

14:15.822 --> 14:17.257
what is going on?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.932
- That man is your father.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.299
- We got the boy.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.134
He's secure.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.405
(soft dramatic piano music)

14:43.150 --> 14:46.686
(fire crackling)

14:46.686 --> 14:49.356
(phone buzzing)

15:05.338 --> 15:09.076
(dramatic suspenseful music)

15:13.180 --> 15:18.185
- (muffled speaking), I
shoulda got information.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.854
- She said she has
good information.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.125
But she says a lot of things.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.898
They can't move Max until
tomorrow at the earliest.

15:31.898 --> 15:32.899
- How much you want?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.070
- Two million.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.005
- How much we got?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.007
- How much you need?

15:41.908 --> 15:42.742
- Two million.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.213
Down goes Frasier.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.184
- Let me see what I can do.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.253
- Right.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.889
So what do you want to do?

15:56.889 --> 15:59.192
- Checked all the safe houses.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.060
He's not there.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.830
Talked to everybody I
know, everybody you know,

16:03.830 --> 16:05.132
everybody everybody knows.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.433
Don't nobody know nothing.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.574
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.745
- [Dreds] Sasha might be
the last chance you got.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.816
- Well that all depends.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.752
Can you put your hands
on two million dollars?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.220
- You gotta be kidding me?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.189
You're gonna actually
give her the money?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.658
I mean that's assuming he
can at least get it first.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.726
It's a waste of time,
time we don't have.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.663
- Can you, Dreds?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.432
- Black folks like
fried chicken.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.935
- Put your hands on
that money, you call me.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.953
- What do you want me to do?

17:00.953 --> 17:02.622
- Put your hands on
everything we've got.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.791
Liquidate it, flip it.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.326
I don't care what
you sell it for.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.261
Turn it into cash, and as
soon as you got the cash,

17:11.464 --> 17:12.299
call me.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.770
- What are you gonna do?

17:18.938 --> 17:22.709
(dramatic suspenseful music)

17:26.613 --> 17:28.448
(men grunting)

17:28.448 --> 17:31.284
(fists thwacking)

17:33.253 --> 17:34.421
- Aw shit.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.255
Ow!

17:36.523 --> 17:38.191
(fist thwacking)

17:38.191 --> 17:39.459
- All you got?

17:39.459 --> 17:42.129
(feet thumping)

17:44.897 --> 17:47.734
(fists thwacking)

17:51.638 --> 17:53.440
(both grunting)

17:53.440 --> 17:55.608
(fists thwacking)

17:55.608 --> 17:58.278
(fist pounding)

18:07.954 --> 18:11.124
(soft dramatic music)

18:14.994 --> 18:17.597
(gun clicking)

18:18.731 --> 18:21.334
- (laughs) Well, well, well.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.869
If it ain't the prodigal son.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.773
You don't look like much.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.143
- I don't think we
should be doing this.

18:30.143 --> 18:30.977
- Shut the fuck up.

18:30.977 --> 18:31.811
Sh!

18:32.812 --> 18:33.646
- Michael!

18:35.848 --> 18:36.849
Hello, Artemis.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.288
Been a long time.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.392
It's taken everything
in my power

18:45.392 --> 18:47.860
not to let these
guys loose on you,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.631
'cause nobody wants
you dead more than me.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.168
- Let me have him boss.
- You heard Olivier.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.271
You can't kill him,

19:02.074 --> 19:03.743
but we can hurt him.

19:04.844 --> 19:05.678
- (laughs) Oh!

19:05.678 --> 19:07.514
(gun firing)

19:07.514 --> 19:10.183
(body thumping)

19:11.284 --> 19:12.485
- (laughs) In here, son.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.924
- They're coming for you.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.227
- Let them come.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.564
- Where is he?

19:24.564 --> 19:25.998
I know you know.
- You don't know shit.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.567
Why would I tell you anything?

19:29.402 --> 19:32.705
They came to your house
and just took him.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.977
(laughs) Like when the little
kids took your lunch money.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.314
(laughs) And Daddy
had to swoop in

19:41.314 --> 19:43.316
and kick they little asses.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.317
- I really wish I
could sit around here

19:44.317 --> 19:45.885
and talk about bedtime stories

19:45.885 --> 19:47.320
and your fucked up
parenting skills,

19:47.320 --> 19:50.390
but I didn't come here for that.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.591
- Then why are you here?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.661
You chose your side.

19:54.661 --> 19:55.728
Stay on it!

19:58.064 --> 19:59.999
Oh, wait a minute.

19:59.999 --> 20:00.900
I got it.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.504
You thought you were
better than good old dad?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.240
Huh?

20:07.240 --> 20:10.877
You with all your ethics
and morality and honor.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.379
All that dumb shit.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.748
Then you jumped your ass
over to the other side

20:15.748 --> 20:17.417
and got your little
heart broken.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.821
Poor sensitive little bitch.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.657
Where was all that morality
when you gave your son to me?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.295
Lower your gun.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.697
Lower it!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.205
- Like it or not,
I'm his father.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.642
- You might be his father,

20:44.644 --> 20:45.978
but I'm his daddy.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.115
- He's my son.
- I raised him!

20:49.115 --> 20:49.949
- You destroyed him.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.983
- I saved him!

20:50.983 --> 20:52.852
- From what?
- From you!

20:52.852 --> 20:55.087
I saved him from you.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.089
You come in here with
your chest all out

20:57.089 --> 20:59.025
like I'm the bad guy.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.593
You federal motherfuckers

21:00.593 --> 21:02.895
have been terrorizing
countries for years.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.033
You're careless.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.001
You're weak.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.571
So is the boy.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.075
He's probably spilling
his guts out right now.

21:16.075 --> 21:16.909
- He don't nothing, man.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.411
- He knows everything.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.880
- He don't know nothing!
- Everything, everything!

21:23.316 --> 21:24.917
Walk while you can.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.287
Walk son.

21:29.356 --> 21:33.025
(dramatic suspenseful music)

21:33.025 --> 21:34.627
- Is that a threat?

21:36.663 --> 21:38.331
- You want it to be?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.812
(muffled speaking)

21:55.314 --> 21:57.450
* Yeah

21:57.450 --> 21:58.785
* What

21:58.785 --> 22:00.753
* I know what time it is

22:00.753 --> 22:04.256
* What time

22:04.256 --> 22:05.525
* What time

22:05.525 --> 22:07.860
* Is y'all ready
for this let it go *

22:07.860 --> 22:11.398
* Yeah yeah yeah yeah

22:11.398 --> 22:14.934
* Yeah yeah yeah

22:14.934 --> 22:18.938
(rhythmic upbeat hip hop music)

22:20.873 --> 22:22.909
* Time it is

22:22.909 --> 22:25.244
* Yeah yeah

22:27.647 --> 22:28.481
- We good?

22:30.082 --> 22:31.784
- Black folks like
collard greens?

22:32.819 --> 22:33.820
- What?

22:33.820 --> 22:36.389
- Turnips, ham hocks?

22:36.389 --> 22:37.223
Pig skins?

22:37.223 --> 22:38.057
- Get in the car.

22:41.327 --> 22:42.862
- (muffled speaking) cornbread.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.332
Dressing.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.101
(Dreds laughing)

22:49.101 --> 22:51.738
(hands slapping)

22:51.738 --> 22:53.139
- Is that what I think it is?

23:03.149 --> 23:04.584
(bag thumping)

23:04.584 --> 23:07.319
(zipper zipping)

23:11.724 --> 23:13.025
You know I'm good for it, right?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.062
- From who I took
from you better be.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.002
- Went by and saw
my dad last night.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.140
He don't know where Max is.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.611
He don't know nothing.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.648
I think he was right.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.919
So it's just my last chance.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.588
I appreciate the money.

23:45.758 --> 23:49.962
- It's always about the
cash, right, isn't it?

23:49.962 --> 23:50.797
- Always.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.668
Always.

23:55.668 --> 23:56.469
- I mean,

23:58.270 --> 24:00.707
you know I'm sorry
but no disrespect.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.008
- Mm-hm.

24:02.008 --> 24:02.942
- But you really gonna trust her

24:02.942 --> 24:04.376
with two million dollars?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.882
- I don't see why I got
much of a choice, Dreds.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.685
- You know the streets
of (muffled speaking)

24:12.685 --> 24:13.920
nothing to play with.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.754
- Yeah, I know that.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.624
I trust her.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.861
(Dreds laughing)

24:21.861 --> 24:23.062
What the fuck that mean?

24:25.264 --> 24:26.699
What?

24:26.699 --> 24:28.568
- You know the streets of
(muffled speaking) run together.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.003
- That what they say?

24:31.003 --> 24:31.838
- She helps you
close a couple cases,

24:31.838 --> 24:33.372
that y'all got close.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.074
- What the fuck y'all say
the streets saying, Dreds?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.711
- She helped you close
a couple of big cases

24:38.711 --> 24:41.047
and y'all got close, real close.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.882
So close they had
to blow your cover

24:42.882 --> 24:44.016
and disperse your team.

24:49.055 --> 24:52.191
- Is that what the
streets are saying?

24:52.191 --> 24:53.626
Or is that what you saying?

24:57.664 --> 25:00.366
- I thought you told
me you were the best.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.935
Isn't that what you
said, when I hired you?

25:02.935 --> 25:05.304
I'm hiring the best,

25:08.307 --> 25:09.408
Taz?

25:11.544 --> 25:12.378
- Yes, boss.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.214
He won't get past me again.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.248
- Oh, I know that.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.921
So if you were me,

25:23.489 --> 25:25.524
what would you do about you?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.593
What, tell me.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.429
Fuck it.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.832
(gun firing)

25:35.501 --> 25:36.569
What's wrong?

25:37.937 --> 25:39.238
Look.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.674
(gun firing)

25:45.444 --> 25:46.278
(gun clicking)

25:46.278 --> 25:47.113
This a bitch.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.955
Mm, lucky motherfucker.

25:56.856 --> 25:57.924
Clean up this shit.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.993
- You heard the boss.

26:00.993 --> 26:01.961
Clean this shit up.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.935
Boy, it's a good thing you
got on your best, homeboy.

26:10.102 --> 26:10.937
Hold on.

26:12.138 --> 26:12.972
You alive?

26:15.775 --> 26:16.876
Check his pulse.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.649
(soft folk music)

26:45.337 --> 26:48.074
(fire crackling)

26:54.647 --> 26:57.984
(soft mysterious music)

27:19.105 --> 27:21.941
(engine humming)

27:21.941 --> 27:24.677
(feet pattering)

27:30.850 --> 27:34.754
(speaking in foreign language)

27:37.924 --> 27:39.425
- Did you miss me?

27:40.459 --> 27:44.230
(soft delicate guitar music)

27:53.139 --> 27:54.640
You got the money?

28:01.981 --> 28:02.815
All of it?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.157
Good.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.101
And now you're gonna let it go?

28:29.708 --> 28:33.479
- Why does it always have to
be about the money with you?

28:33.479 --> 28:36.648
(soft dramatic music)

29:11.517 --> 29:13.519
- That's what I thought.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.460
Look for the white angel.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.399
(soft dramatic music)

29:30.302 --> 29:31.137
- Right.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.341
- Artemis.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.585
You never answered my question.

29:48.687 --> 29:49.521
- What was it?

29:51.157 --> 29:52.324
- You know what it was.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.496
- If I said yes would
it change anything?

29:57.496 --> 30:00.666
(soft dramatic music)

30:13.712 --> 30:16.382
(door slamming)

30:21.653 --> 30:22.989
- Yes, it would.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.739
- [Olivier's Henchman]
He's on the move.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.577
- Where's he headed?

30:55.287 --> 30:57.823
- [Olivier's Henchman] Sasha's.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.059
- You sure?

31:03.062 --> 31:05.331
- [Olivier's Henchman] Yes.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.835
- What about the boy?

31:11.770 --> 31:15.107
- [Olivier's Henchman]
Nowhere in sight.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.314
- Did I ever tell
you I was born a god?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.922
It frightened my mother.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.890
My friends, my teachers.

31:34.460 --> 31:38.697
At any moment I could look at
them and they would tremble.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.699
Look dead in their eyes.

31:42.101 --> 31:42.901
I knew when they were lying.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.305
I have that gift.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.078
(suspenseful dramatic music)

31:57.883 --> 31:58.951
Stay on Artemis.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.222
He'll lead you to the boy.

32:06.792 --> 32:07.626
- [Olivier's
Bodyguard] No problem.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.538
- After that go to
that bitch's house

32:19.538 --> 32:20.772
and get me my money.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.180
- [Olivier's Bodyguard] Got it.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.015
- Hey.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.051
Hey.
- Yes?

32:33.585 --> 32:34.786
- Stay close.

32:37.889 --> 32:41.393
(suspenseful eerie music)

32:52.404 --> 32:54.406
- [Man With Black Hair] Yeah,
I want two redheads please.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.076
- Make mine a blond.
- Wait, no scratch that.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.444
Make it a--
- And a puffy nipple.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.313
- Big, big, make it
one blond, one redhead,

33:01.313 --> 33:02.681
big boobs.
- You're serious?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.983
- 18 to 30, hey,
come on, come on.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.119
- We cannot be doing this.

33:07.119 --> 33:11.223
- Yeah, make it your freakiest
girls please if you could.

33:15.094 --> 33:18.330
6810 Aqueduct Avenue,
is that what it is?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.731
- Yeah, Aqueduct.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.133
- Yeah, the big white house.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.102
Yeah, please, please.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.970
Again, your freakiest,
your nastiest.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.605
- This is crazy.
- All right, we'll be waiting.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.439
- This is crazy.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.309
- All right, yeah.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.443
We'll be paying cash.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.546
He'll be paying cash, thank you.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.986
- You should've just
given them our names.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.021
- You know, you're right, man.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.323
I should have, stupid.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.359
- We,

33:47.359 --> 33:50.129
(phone slamming)

33:50.129 --> 33:55.134
they said no one is
to know where we are.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.271
- They're just
hookers, man, come on.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.606
Hey, you gotta calm down.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.607
Hey.

34:01.607 --> 34:02.974
We take this boy tomorrow,

34:02.974 --> 34:04.410
there's no telling
where we're gonna be.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.345
How long we're gonna be there.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.779
Just have some fun, all right?

34:07.779 --> 34:08.714
Hey look, look.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.816
We're gonna get laid tonight.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.484
I don't know about
you, but I am.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.452
You need to.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.256
Just have some fun.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.424
I do this all the time.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.896
(fist knocking)

34:24.896 --> 34:26.998
Yeah see.
- Well, that was fast.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.100
- That's what they do.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.937
Hey, be nice, all right?

34:31.937 --> 34:33.172
Answer the door, be nice.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.374
- I'm always nice.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.246
(soft dramatic music)

34:47.453 --> 34:49.255
- Tony, who is it?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.794
Tony!

34:55.794 --> 34:56.928
Tony, where you at man?

34:57.963 --> 34:58.797
- Gun.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.302
Right.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.840
(soft dramatic music)

35:40.872 --> 35:43.609
(feet pattering)

35:49.815 --> 35:50.649
- Decker.

35:51.750 --> 35:52.584
Hey.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.086
- What are you doing here?

35:55.086 --> 35:56.021
- We need to talk.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.291
- Where's Robbie?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.059
- Something's come up.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.262
- We got him.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.730
- Not yet.

36:04.730 --> 36:05.731
- Then why are you here?

36:05.731 --> 36:07.132
It's not about Olivier.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.166
We have nothing to talk--
- They go the boy.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.235
Okay, they hit the safe house--

36:09.235 --> 36:09.901
- Who?
- And somehow they

36:09.901 --> 36:11.002
got the boy.

36:11.002 --> 36:11.837
- Who?

36:13.205 --> 36:14.506
- They think it's Olivier.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.445
- Shit's never gonna end.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.979
- Just thought you should know.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.316
- Are the two
agents still alive?

36:26.852 --> 36:27.686
- Yeah.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.820
- Then it's not Olivier.

36:30.088 --> 36:31.757
Do we still have
eyes on Artemis?

36:32.924 --> 36:35.193
We gotta move now and
we gotta move fast.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.662
- Okay.
- Get as many guys

36:36.662 --> 36:38.063
as you can.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.231
Make sure that we
can trust them.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.966
- [Cash] Okay, on it.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.909
(soft dramatic piano music)

37:45.431 --> 37:48.667
(car door slamming)

37:48.667 --> 37:50.402
- [Decker] You ready?

38:03.715 --> 38:05.951
- Look I know I ain't

38:05.951 --> 38:07.218
been a good father.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.858
But I'm trying.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.929
I'd do anything for you, man.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.169
And I apologize for
bringing you over

38:24.169 --> 38:25.737
to my father's house like that.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.572
I mean,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.141
I didn't know he was gonna

38:30.141 --> 38:31.710
show you the things
he showed you.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.544
I just,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.651
I didn't know what else to do.

38:44.356 --> 38:47.158
I just tried to do what's right,

38:47.158 --> 38:48.894
and then it just
blows up in your face.

38:48.894 --> 38:49.728
It's like,

38:53.399 --> 38:57.202
people got these wolves
inside of them, right?

38:57.202 --> 38:58.504
Two of 'em.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.038
One good, one bad.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.275
They make us do dumb things.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.579
They just battle, you know?

39:10.148 --> 39:11.249
- Which wolf wins?

39:17.423 --> 39:18.990
- The one you feed.

39:24.496 --> 39:28.333
(soft delicate piano music)

39:28.333 --> 39:29.668
I love you, son.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.405
- I love you too, dad.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.713
- Get some sleep.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.062
- Time to say hello
to an old friend.

40:05.103 --> 40:08.006
(car door slamming)

40:08.006 --> 40:11.443
(intense dramatic music)

40:18.316 --> 40:22.087
(refrigerator door slamming)

40:28.426 --> 40:31.863
(bag crinkling)

40:31.863 --> 40:33.465
- Best thing in the
middle of the night

40:35.333 --> 40:36.502
is a cold drink, right?

40:44.610 --> 40:47.178
(Decker sighs)

40:47.178 --> 40:47.979
Going somewhere?

40:50.248 --> 40:51.049
- No.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.287
(mouth whistling)

41:04.195 --> 41:07.499
- The best thing that
you can do is cooperate.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.333
- Mm-hm.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.401
- Dad, dad!

41:10.401 --> 41:11.236
- [Cash] Decker, got the boy.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.070
(walkie talkie beeping)

41:12.070 --> 41:12.904
- [Max] Let me go!

41:12.904 --> 41:15.807
(body thumping)

41:15.807 --> 41:17.042
- Cash?

41:17.042 --> 41:18.043
(walkie talkie beeping)

41:18.043 --> 41:19.244
- [Cash] Decker, what?

41:19.244 --> 41:20.546
- Find them.

41:20.546 --> 41:23.849
(walkie talkie beeping)

41:23.849 --> 41:25.517
I don't want you.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.451
We've been through this.

41:26.451 --> 41:27.953
I want your father.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.889
- I don't know nothing.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.726
I keep trying to tell
you I don't know nothing.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.064
- I looked up to you.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.068
Cash.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.170
(walkie talkie beeping)

41:45.170 --> 41:46.071
- [Cash] Decker, we've
searched everywhere.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.939
He's not here.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.476
(walkie talkie beeping)

41:51.476 --> 41:55.446
- So, what's it gonna be

41:56.414 --> 41:58.984
because you're either with me

42:02.253 --> 42:03.288
or you're against me.

42:18.937 --> 42:19.771
You and me,

42:23.108 --> 42:24.676
we're gonna go
for a little ride.

42:27.779 --> 42:30.782
(car door slamming)

42:38.156 --> 42:39.791
I got the boy.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.359
- So you got the boy right now.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.561
What about the money?

42:43.561 --> 42:44.395
I'm gonna get that to you.

42:45.797 --> 42:46.632
Where you at?

42:48.600 --> 42:49.768
Text it to me.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.072
I got it.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.108
- You running from me?

43:00.078 --> 43:02.914
(Olivier laughing)

43:04.650 --> 43:07.719
You know, as I was
looking for you,

43:07.719 --> 43:11.923
I ran across the craziest
thing up on top of the hill

43:11.923 --> 43:13.825
at the end of the block.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.293
You know which one I'm
talking about, right?

43:15.293 --> 43:16.227
Yeah.

43:16.227 --> 43:21.032
I ran across a pack of wolves,

43:23.168 --> 43:24.670
howling wolves.

43:28.339 --> 43:33.111
You could hear the
hunger in their sound.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.287
(Olivier howling)

43:46.124 --> 43:47.525
Once you hear it,

43:48.727 --> 43:50.962
once you hear their hunger,

43:51.963 --> 43:54.565
to hear my hunger and my sound.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.504
(Olivier howling)

44:05.711 --> 44:06.778
I'm starving.

44:10.515 --> 44:11.950
I'm hungry.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.587
If I thought for any reason
you were running from me--

44:16.587 --> 44:17.889
- I'm not running from you.

44:17.889 --> 44:19.124
- Good.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.893
Because if I thought you
were running from me,

44:25.430 --> 44:28.399
I would snatch
you by your weave,

44:30.335 --> 44:35.306
snatch your head clean off
and feed it to those wolves.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.645
You got my money?

44:41.679 --> 44:43.148
You got my money?

44:43.148 --> 44:44.049
- I'm on it.

44:49.755 --> 44:50.989
- You're on it.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.495
We hit the safe house, no money,

44:59.330 --> 45:04.269
which leaves me to
conclude you got my money!

45:05.804 --> 45:06.772
- Come on, I don't.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.409
But if you just give me
a little bit of time,

45:11.409 --> 45:12.610
I promise, I'll have it.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.150
- What about the boy?

45:20.485 --> 45:21.953
What about the boy?

45:23.088 --> 45:25.723
- I'll have the boy and
I'll have your money

45:27.292 --> 45:28.126
by sunrise.

45:36.467 --> 45:39.537
- You willing to
bet your life on it?

45:39.537 --> 45:41.606
You willing to bet
your life on it?

45:45.343 --> 45:47.312
See ya in the morning.

46:02.360 --> 46:05.030
(door slamming)

46:10.335 --> 46:14.439
(soft ominous suspenseful music)

46:16.774 --> 46:19.777
(car door slamming)

46:28.887 --> 46:31.556
(phone ringing)

46:32.390 --> 46:33.224
- Cash.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.363
- We got a problem.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.699
- What is it?
- Artemis is off the grid.

46:43.401 --> 46:45.336
- Maybe he want it that way.

46:45.336 --> 46:48.039
- No, he wouldn't go anywhere
without letting me know.

46:50.008 --> 46:52.010
- What makes you so important?

46:52.010 --> 46:53.411
- Because I got all the money.

46:59.250 --> 47:02.954
- All of it?
- All of it.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.422
- Text me when you get close.

47:12.363 --> 47:14.966
(gun clicking)

47:16.634 --> 47:19.137
(engine revving)

47:19.137 --> 47:21.639
(car beeping)

47:23.541 --> 47:26.277
(engine roaring)

47:29.948 --> 47:32.017
- Hey, what's up, homie?

47:32.017 --> 47:34.319
You got a package?

47:34.319 --> 47:35.820
- Why are you talking like that?

47:35.820 --> 47:37.088
- Like what, cous'?

47:37.088 --> 47:38.356
- Stop it.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.058
- Hey, it's cool, it's cool.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.093
Hey, take a chill
pill home slice.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.761
Let's get to business.

47:43.761 --> 47:44.695
- Everything ready?

47:46.031 --> 47:46.965
- For shizzle my nizzle.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.199
- Unlock the fucking shed.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.200
I'm gonna get the
boy out the car.

47:50.301 --> 47:51.169
- On it (laughs).

47:53.238 --> 47:57.408
(soft dramatic
suspenseful music)

48:25.503 --> 48:28.173
(door rattling)

48:30.775 --> 48:33.378
- You gonna lock it?
- What for?

48:37.949 --> 48:38.984
The boy's secure.

48:40.285 --> 48:42.353
- All eyes on the
target till I get back.

48:42.353 --> 48:43.188
Let me talk to T.

48:44.189 --> 48:45.523
- You got it.

48:45.523 --> 48:48.859
(walkie talkie beeping)

48:51.362 --> 48:52.230
- Is Ellie there?

48:53.131 --> 48:54.632
- Not yet, boss.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.067
- Keep an eye out.

48:56.067 --> 48:57.702
It's gonna get a little tricky.

48:57.702 --> 48:58.703
(walkie talkie beeping)

48:58.703 --> 48:59.937
I'm gonna make a little detour.

48:59.937 --> 49:03.208
(walkie talkie beeping)

49:13.318 --> 49:16.087
(feet pattering)

49:18.523 --> 49:19.657
- Anything from Decker?

49:19.657 --> 49:20.491
- Just lost him.

49:21.726 --> 49:22.860
- Yeah, well find him.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.131
- It's Mike.

49:26.964 --> 49:27.798
This is Mike.

49:29.534 --> 49:33.704
(soft dramatic
suspenseful music)

49:41.679 --> 49:43.048
(phone ringing)

49:43.048 --> 49:44.282
- [Sasha] Hey
(muffled speaking).

49:44.282 --> 49:46.117
- I followed him down
here like you said.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.319
He's in trouble.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.320
I think you better
get down here.

49:50.888 --> 49:55.060
(soft dramatic
suspenseful music)

50:00.365 --> 50:01.299
Well?

50:01.299 --> 50:02.433
- [Mike] Still nothing.

50:06.704 --> 50:07.538
- Where's T?

50:10.241 --> 50:11.076
- T?

50:12.443 --> 50:13.278
T!

50:15.346 --> 50:16.547
- I don't like that guy.

50:18.916 --> 50:19.750
- [T] What?

50:21.719 --> 50:23.088
- What the hell are you doing?

50:24.322 --> 50:25.823
- Why?

50:25.823 --> 50:27.058
- [Mike] Come on you two.

50:30.795 --> 50:33.531
- I was checking the perimeter
if that's okay with you.

50:36.934 --> 50:40.205
- I really, really
don't like that guy.

50:40.205 --> 50:44.342
(soft dramatic
suspenseful music)

50:53.384 --> 50:56.621
- The problem with our
agency is the rules.

50:58.889 --> 51:00.658
Can't do anything
without procedure.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.595
But if I can speak frankly,

51:06.731 --> 51:08.133
it just takes too damn long.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.438
And by the time you
finish with protocol,

51:13.438 --> 51:15.072
it really doesn't
matter anymore.

51:16.874 --> 51:20.811
But the good thing is...

51:24.315 --> 51:25.816
(fist thwacking)

51:25.816 --> 51:27.785
(Artemis groaning)

51:27.785 --> 51:28.619
- Here!

51:32.990 --> 51:36.727
- I'm not working for
the agency anymore

51:36.727 --> 51:38.229
thanks to that little incident

51:41.532 --> 51:42.367
at your place.

51:46.471 --> 51:51.276
So make it easy on yourself

51:51.276 --> 51:52.777
and tell me what I need to know

51:56.347 --> 51:59.217
'cause I'm not
gonna ask you again.

52:00.251 --> 52:03.154
(soft guitar music)

52:06.291 --> 52:07.292
- [Woman In Black Jacket]
I thought you said you

52:07.292 --> 52:08.293
were through with that, dude.

52:08.293 --> 52:10.695
- Just give me the gun.

52:10.695 --> 52:11.529
(gun clicking)

52:11.529 --> 52:12.497
I'll take it from here.

52:12.497 --> 52:14.365
You have a nice day.

52:14.365 --> 52:16.033
- Really?
- Yep.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.304
- If you need me
you know what to do.

52:21.839 --> 52:22.673
Bitch.

52:24.074 --> 52:25.075
- I heard you.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.821
(soft eerie music)

52:37.755 --> 52:39.924
- I'm gonna count to five.

52:47.998 --> 52:51.135
One, two,

52:53.471 --> 52:54.272
three,

52:57.275 --> 52:58.075
four.

53:01.412 --> 53:05.149
(dramatic suspenseful music)

53:06.717 --> 53:08.253
Five.

53:08.253 --> 53:10.921
(gun firing)

53:10.921 --> 53:14.692
(suspenseful dramatic music)

53:26.070 --> 53:28.339
- I knew you missed me.

53:28.339 --> 53:31.609
(festive guitar music)

53:33.010 --> 53:33.844
* Hoo

53:33.844 --> 53:36.914
(dog barking)

53:36.914 --> 53:41.352
* Hoo

53:41.352 --> 53:45.055
* Hoo

53:45.055 --> 53:46.891
* Hoo

53:49.093 --> 53:50.661
(Artemis groaning)

53:50.661 --> 53:53.931
(door thumping)

53:53.931 --> 53:54.765
- Mack.

53:56.334 --> 53:57.702
Find your partner.

54:03.708 --> 54:06.311
(leaves crunching)

54:06.311 --> 54:07.144
- Hey kid.

54:10.848 --> 54:13.250
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

54:16.053 --> 54:16.954
But I will.

54:18.489 --> 54:21.826
(soft delicate music)

54:21.826 --> 54:24.662
(muffled singing)

54:39.410 --> 54:42.112
(phone beeping)

54:43.147 --> 54:45.816
(phone ringing)

54:55.225 --> 54:56.594
- Hm, motherfucker.

54:56.594 --> 54:57.995
(gun firing)

54:57.995 --> 54:58.996
Fuck.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.966
(gun firing)

55:01.966 --> 55:03.167
(gun firing)

55:03.167 --> 55:04.435
(glass shattering)

55:04.435 --> 55:07.638
(phone ringing)

55:07.638 --> 55:09.407
Where did I put it?

55:09.407 --> 55:10.508
Awesome.

55:10.508 --> 55:13.944
(phone ringing)

55:13.944 --> 55:14.879
Where are you at?

55:14.879 --> 55:16.013
- Just around the corner.

55:16.013 --> 55:16.847
Fuck.

55:20.485 --> 55:23.053
(wind blowing)

55:42.473 --> 55:45.410
- [Woman With Blond Hair] There.

55:45.410 --> 55:50.415
Hi.

56:12.703 --> 56:13.704
- Where are my clothes?

56:13.704 --> 56:15.640
- They're being washed.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.907
- Where's Sasha?

56:16.907 --> 56:18.142
- That's a really good question.

56:18.142 --> 56:20.077
You know, sometimes when
you take an agent out,

56:20.077 --> 56:21.946
you should lay low
for a little while.

56:28.486 --> 56:29.754
- Where am I?

56:29.754 --> 56:31.021
- Safe with me.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.358
- Who are you?

56:35.893 --> 56:38.162
- Who do you want me to be?

56:46.471 --> 56:47.304
- Okay.

56:48.539 --> 56:50.207
What's next?
- Thought you'd never ask.

56:56.213 --> 56:58.716
- Who are you texting?
- Sasha.

57:02.887 --> 57:05.623
You know, you strike me as
a really intelligent man.

57:05.623 --> 57:09.193
But you gotta explain to me
how do you leave your son

57:09.193 --> 57:11.361
with a psychopath like Olivier?

57:13.097 --> 57:15.600
- That psychopath's my father.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.844
He was a good man until
he killed my mother.

57:30.047 --> 57:32.917
Things went bad from there.
- What happened?

57:39.690 --> 57:41.158
- My father was an agent.

57:43.861 --> 57:45.329
He's an insider.

57:45.329 --> 57:46.664
He knows somebody that
gets inside organizations

57:46.664 --> 57:49.033
and tears them out
from inside out.

57:50.434 --> 57:51.536
He's the best.

57:54.038 --> 57:54.905
His last mission,

57:57.141 --> 57:58.509
things got really crazy.

58:00.711 --> 58:04.982
Suicide mission and they
left him there to die.

58:07.652 --> 58:09.754
They sent a clean
up crew to mom's.

58:09.754 --> 58:10.588
My mother,

58:15.693 --> 58:17.728
(muffled speaking) they ran.

58:25.035 --> 58:27.805
Just can't run forever.

58:31.576 --> 58:34.579
So they found us and

58:36.614 --> 58:39.617
she dropped me off on the steps
of a church and disappeared.

58:50.728 --> 58:52.029
- And how do you feel now?

59:02.406 --> 59:05.009
(gun clicking)

59:06.644 --> 59:07.544
Here we go.

59:15.152 --> 59:17.988
(soft folk music)

59:39.476 --> 59:42.713
- So I guess this is a goodbye.

59:42.713 --> 59:44.782
- Where are you going?
- Somewhere far

59:45.650 --> 59:47.051
where they can't find me.

59:50.655 --> 59:55.660
You coming?

59:57.461 --> 59:58.295
- Not yet.

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:01.832
- Right.

1:00:04.869 --> 1:00:07.705
You can find Olivier
here and Max.

1:00:07.705 --> 1:00:09.640
Be careful, they will
be expecting you.

1:00:19.917 --> 1:00:23.087
(soft dramatic music)

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:45.676
See.

1:00:47.344 --> 1:00:48.913
It's not always about the money.

1:00:58.789 --> 1:00:59.589
- Sasha?

1:01:00.891 --> 1:01:02.226
- [Sasha] Mm-hm.

1:01:07.898 --> 1:01:09.299
- [Artemis] I will find you.

1:01:14.772 --> 1:01:15.605
- I know.

1:01:20.110 --> 1:01:23.213
(soft hip hop music)

1:01:35.993 --> 1:01:36.827
- Tony.

1:01:39.463 --> 1:01:40.564
Unholster your weapon.

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:43.734
- Excuse me?

1:01:43.734 --> 1:01:45.335
- Unholster your fucking weapon!

1:01:51.876 --> 1:01:55.445
Put the barrel
against nephew's head.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:02:00.217
Put the goddamn barrel
against his head!

1:02:05.823 --> 1:02:07.357
Now pull the trigger.

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:17.802
Give me the goddamn gun.

1:02:17.802 --> 1:02:19.904
Give it to me, give it here.

1:02:19.904 --> 1:02:22.472
(gun thumping)

1:02:26.877 --> 1:02:31.215
You must be able to
answer the question.

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:33.417
Nephew.

1:02:41.358 --> 1:02:43.260
Are we clear?

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.062
Am I clear?

1:02:45.062 --> 1:02:45.896
- Yes.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:50.434
- Now where was I?

1:02:53.070 --> 1:02:53.871
Right.

1:02:55.705 --> 1:02:57.141
There was a shoot out.

1:02:58.542 --> 1:03:00.544
Like we're in the
fucking Ukraine!

1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:07.985
My son and the rest
of those misfits,

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:11.155
nowhere to be found

1:03:12.890 --> 1:03:17.061
and you tell me some agent,

1:03:17.061 --> 1:03:20.097
some clown who
claims to be an agent

1:03:20.097 --> 1:03:23.100
wants to return
my grandson to me.

1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:26.570
All I gotta do is buy
a ticket to the circus

1:03:26.570 --> 1:03:29.974
and hand over five
million dollars.

1:03:29.974 --> 1:03:32.109
- Boss, we'll handle him.

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:35.745
Rest assured, we got him.

1:03:37.647 --> 1:03:38.883
We got this.

1:03:45.555 --> 1:03:46.390
- Johnson,

1:03:48.758 --> 1:03:49.759
set up the meeting.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:52.196
Surround the compound.

1:03:54.932 --> 1:03:56.766
Leak the information
about the meeting,

1:03:56.766 --> 1:03:59.336
make sure all of the
channels are informed.

1:04:01.638 --> 1:04:05.142
Draw all the flies to the honey.

1:04:12.282 --> 1:04:14.751
- Sir?
- Yes.

1:04:15.719 --> 1:04:17.454
- The question.

1:04:17.454 --> 1:04:20.257
You said, "You have to know
the answer to the question."

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:24.428
What's the question, sir?

1:04:25.529 --> 1:04:27.597
- Set up the goddamn trap!

1:04:33.403 --> 1:04:34.671
- I don't like this shit.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:42.812
(phone ringing)

1:04:42.812 --> 1:04:44.414
Change of plans.

1:04:44.414 --> 1:04:46.450
Meet me at the gas
station on third.

1:04:46.450 --> 1:04:48.018
Black pickup.

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:50.220
You got 30 minutes,
no money, no deal.

1:04:59.529 --> 1:05:00.830
- [Johnson] He
changed the location.

1:05:00.830 --> 1:05:01.999
He changed the fucking location!

1:05:01.999 --> 1:05:04.734
- What do you mean
they changed locations?

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.370
- [Johnson] I don't
know what to do!

1:05:07.604 --> 1:05:08.772
What do you--
- Hey, hey, hey,

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.840
this is not fucking
calculus, huh?

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:12.142
Simple arithmetic.

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:14.511
One plus one equal two.

1:05:14.511 --> 1:05:16.280
Does he have the boy?

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.547
- [Johnson] Man,

1:05:17.547 --> 1:05:18.983
we talking five
million dollars here!

1:05:18.983 --> 1:05:20.484
Five million dollars
and he out here playing.

1:05:20.484 --> 1:05:22.352
- I'm not to be
fucked with today.

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:25.389
It's simple math.

1:05:25.389 --> 1:05:27.091
One plus one equal two.

1:05:27.091 --> 1:05:28.525
Does he have the boy?

1:05:29.393 --> 1:05:30.794
- [Johnson] You know what?

1:05:30.794 --> 1:05:31.728
We should back out.

1:05:33.063 --> 1:05:34.198
I'm headed back, that's it.

1:05:34.198 --> 1:05:35.399
- Yeah, shut the fuck up.

1:05:35.399 --> 1:05:36.900
Just shut the fuck up.

1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:38.402
Does he have the boy?

1:05:39.303 --> 1:05:41.071
- Yes.
- Then pay him.

1:05:42.072 --> 1:05:44.908
(phone ringing)

1:05:44.908 --> 1:05:45.942
- [Man On Phone] Clock's
ticking, Mortega.

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.711
What's your status?

1:05:47.711 --> 1:05:49.179
- I said I'd get the money.

1:05:49.179 --> 1:05:51.081
Just need a little
bit more time.

1:05:51.081 --> 1:05:52.316
Just till the end of the day.

1:05:52.316 --> 1:05:54.118
- [Man On Phone]
You have one hour.

1:05:54.118 --> 1:05:54.951
- Hello?

1:05:56.086 --> 1:05:57.154
Hello?

1:05:57.154 --> 1:05:57.988
- Don't worry.

1:05:59.389 --> 1:06:00.190
He'll pay.

1:06:03.393 --> 1:06:04.228
- Oh yeah?

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:07.531
- Yeah.

1:06:08.832 --> 1:06:13.170
He's crazy, but he loves me.

1:06:19.676 --> 1:06:22.546
(engine revving)

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:23.380
Told ya.

1:06:28.285 --> 1:06:31.788
(car door slamming)

1:06:31.788 --> 1:06:35.059
(soft dramatic music)

1:06:35.059 --> 1:06:38.062
(car door slamming)

1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:13.597
(soft mysterious music)

1:07:22.839 --> 1:07:26.743
(soft delicate dramatic music)

1:07:55.605 --> 1:07:56.440
- He good.

1:08:00.944 --> 1:08:02.112
He been expecting you.

1:08:04.047 --> 1:08:07.217
(soft dramatic music)

1:08:19.363 --> 1:08:22.566
(door squeaking)

1:08:22.566 --> 1:08:24.134
- I have a gift you see.

1:08:26.803 --> 1:08:29.806
I can look right
into a man's eyes

1:08:30.974 --> 1:08:33.977
and know when he's scared.

1:08:37.314 --> 1:08:39.483
- When you look in my
eyes what do you see?

1:08:45.389 --> 1:08:46.223
- Me.

1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:54.097
They burned her, your mother.

1:08:57.667 --> 1:08:58.935
Took her out on a boat.

1:09:03.039 --> 1:09:05.209
Tied a bag over her head.

1:09:06.743 --> 1:09:09.679
(soft piano music)

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:13.049
An anchor to her feet.

1:09:18.622 --> 1:09:19.823
Dropped her into a lake.

1:09:27.864 --> 1:09:29.599
Left her there for days.

1:09:39.409 --> 1:09:44.348
I think about that every day.

1:09:44.348 --> 1:09:49.353
I think about that.

1:09:52.456 --> 1:09:53.290
Every day.

1:09:57.294 --> 1:09:58.528
I think about her.

1:10:04.601 --> 1:10:05.502
They did that.

1:10:08.037 --> 1:10:09.406
And I'm the monster.

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:15.579
Anyone can be a killer, anyone.

1:10:18.615 --> 1:10:22.752
- She called for you, my mother.

1:10:25.489 --> 1:10:27.957
Day after day after
this she called for you.

1:10:30.894 --> 1:10:32.362
I don't understand how a man

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:34.431
can spend his entire life
protecting the country

1:10:34.431 --> 1:10:36.065
and can't protect
his own family.

1:10:42.105 --> 1:10:43.473
Anything you've ever given me,

1:10:43.473 --> 1:10:45.074
the money, the protection,

1:10:45.074 --> 1:10:46.643
you gave me 'cause
you wanted to.

1:10:46.643 --> 1:10:48.244
I never asked you for nothing.

1:10:52.782 --> 1:10:54.351
I'm asking you now, Pop.

1:10:57.521 --> 1:11:00.490
I know you know where
he is and if I'da,

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:06.129
if you don't know where
he is you got him.

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:10.567
And I'm asking you,

1:11:13.069 --> 1:11:14.203
they're coming for you.

1:11:16.005 --> 1:11:18.074
They're coming for you
and it's not to talk, Pop.

1:11:20.444 --> 1:11:24.514
(soft dramatic orchestral music)

1:11:25.615 --> 1:11:29.118
My son deserves a
chance at a normal life.

1:11:38.328 --> 1:11:39.796
- Yeah.

1:11:39.796 --> 1:11:43.767
Tomorrow afternoon, my
house (muffled speaking).

1:11:45.068 --> 1:11:46.235
It'd be safer there.

1:11:48.271 --> 1:11:49.072
Okay?

1:11:53.076 --> 1:11:53.877
Okay.

1:12:05.389 --> 1:12:08.558
(dramatic jazz music)

1:12:20.370 --> 1:12:23.540
(background chatting)

1:12:25.642 --> 1:12:26.576
(muffled speaking)

1:12:26.576 --> 1:12:28.344
- You almost killed her, Decker.

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:29.212
You don't care.

1:12:30.614 --> 1:12:31.715
- I almost killed her?

1:12:33.116 --> 1:12:34.418
I'm the one that got shot.

1:12:36.085 --> 1:12:39.188
Robbie, I'm right about this.

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:41.024
You'll see.

1:12:45.028 --> 1:12:46.796
Did you get what
I asked you to do?

1:12:48.131 --> 1:12:49.165
What'd you find?

1:12:50.166 --> 1:12:51.701
- You're in way over your head.

1:12:51.701 --> 1:12:53.269
- And what did you find?

1:12:53.269 --> 1:12:54.538
- It is my duty to inform you

1:12:54.538 --> 1:12:56.973
that the agency will
not back you on this.

1:12:56.973 --> 1:12:59.308
- You're right,
they won't back me.

1:13:05.081 --> 1:13:06.483
- There's a meeting planned.

1:13:08.284 --> 1:13:09.486
- Do you have an address?

1:13:14.758 --> 1:13:17.226
- [Robbie] There's nothing I
can say to stop you, is there?

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:27.236
- How do you think that
Olivier has stayed two steps

1:13:27.236 --> 1:13:28.572
ahead of us the whole time?

1:13:31.708 --> 1:13:33.910
If Olivier's Batman
I'll be damned

1:13:33.910 --> 1:13:35.879
if Artemis isn't his Robin.

1:13:35.879 --> 1:13:37.113
They're working together.

1:13:40.784 --> 1:13:42.251
- You make an
accusation like that,

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:44.287
you're going to need proof.

1:13:44.287 --> 1:13:45.489
- [Decker] That's
what I'm doing.

1:13:49.425 --> 1:13:50.727
So do you have an address?

1:13:56.633 --> 1:13:58.334
Call it in, I'm
gonna need backup.

1:13:59.703 --> 1:14:02.271
(phone ringing)

1:14:04.173 --> 1:14:05.174
- [T] Hello?

1:14:05.174 --> 1:14:06.442
(muffled speaking)

1:14:06.442 --> 1:14:07.443
- [Robbie] I'm
gonna need you to go

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:08.377
to that rendezvous point.

1:14:08.377 --> 1:14:09.345
- [T] Out by the towers?

1:14:09.345 --> 1:14:10.213
- Yes, that one.

1:14:10.213 --> 1:14:11.247
As fast as you can.

1:14:11.247 --> 1:14:12.782
And have units ready.

1:14:12.782 --> 1:14:14.283
This could be big.
- Listen.

1:14:15.519 --> 1:14:16.352
Hello?

1:14:18.254 --> 1:14:19.088
Sh!

1:14:28.464 --> 1:14:30.199
(phone ringing)

1:14:30.199 --> 1:14:31.467
Something's come up.

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:34.270
I'll be a little late
but I'm still coming.

1:14:34.270 --> 1:14:38.007
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1:14:46.550 --> 1:14:49.218
(phone ringing)

1:14:51.788 --> 1:14:52.622
- Anything?

1:14:55.692 --> 1:14:56.926
All right, stay on it.

1:14:56.926 --> 1:14:59.128
As soon as you hear
anything you call me.

1:14:59.128 --> 1:15:00.496
You understand?

1:15:00.496 --> 1:15:01.731
Time is of the essence.

1:15:06.469 --> 1:15:07.303
Calling someone?

1:15:10.574 --> 1:15:12.375
It's about time to let that go.

1:15:12.375 --> 1:15:13.476
It's been long enough.

1:15:14.978 --> 1:15:16.312
Besides, you got more
important matters

1:15:16.312 --> 1:15:17.446
to deal with right now.

1:15:22.385 --> 1:15:24.287
Where's Decker and your team?

1:15:24.287 --> 1:15:25.354
- Out of the country.

1:15:27.591 --> 1:15:28.692
- You sure about that?

1:15:30.426 --> 1:15:32.295
Decker's been acting
paranoid lately.

1:15:35.632 --> 1:15:36.633
- I'm sure about it.

1:15:38.501 --> 1:15:39.335
Right here.

1:15:40.837 --> 1:15:41.905
Dred's clean.

1:15:42.972 --> 1:15:43.807
You come with me.

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:48.778
Cash, just get a permit.

1:15:49.713 --> 1:15:51.114
Come join the party.

1:15:53.650 --> 1:15:56.653
(car door slamming)

1:15:59.155 --> 1:16:01.758
(wind whipping)

1:16:12.636 --> 1:16:15.138
- What we have here
is a rendezvous.

1:16:25.949 --> 1:16:28.718
(birds chirping)

1:16:31.554 --> 1:16:32.756
- How you doing, Max?

1:16:32.756 --> 1:16:34.290
You ready to go?
- Hold up a minute.

1:16:35.825 --> 1:16:36.660
- What?

1:16:39.462 --> 1:16:41.130
- Where you going?
- Why?

1:16:41.130 --> 1:16:44.333
- Maybe I want to see
my grandson sometime.

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:45.601
- I'll drop you a postcard.

1:16:45.601 --> 1:16:48.004
- I asked you
where you're going.

1:16:48.004 --> 1:16:49.438
I deserve an answer.

1:16:50.306 --> 1:16:51.407
- I lost all my money.

1:16:54.343 --> 1:16:56.045
Lives of some friends
and all I really want,

1:16:56.045 --> 1:16:58.848
you said you was gonna
give me back my son, Pop.

1:16:58.848 --> 1:17:01.284
(dog barking)

1:17:03.086 --> 1:17:03.920
You gotta forgive me.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:05.254
I just don't give a damn

1:17:05.254 --> 1:17:06.890
what you think you
deserve right now.

1:17:06.890 --> 1:17:07.724
- Son,

1:17:09.325 --> 1:17:10.694
you're not a killer.

1:17:11.594 --> 1:17:13.429
If they come after him,

1:17:13.429 --> 1:17:15.665
you won't be able to stop them.

1:17:15.665 --> 1:17:18.968
They'll take him and
we'll never see him again.

1:17:18.968 --> 1:17:19.769
- They won't.

1:17:19.769 --> 1:17:21.237
- They won't, what?

1:17:21.237 --> 1:17:22.071
Take him?

1:17:23.773 --> 1:17:26.109
(soft dramatic music)

1:17:26.109 --> 1:17:27.744
- You said you were gonna
give him back to me.

1:17:27.744 --> 1:17:29.478
You said me at--
- I know what I said!

1:17:29.478 --> 1:17:31.981
- You said--
- I know what I said,

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:33.016
goddammit!

1:17:34.818 --> 1:17:36.252
- I doesn't mean anything.

1:17:36.252 --> 1:17:37.086
- You're right.

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:43.126
It means everything.

1:17:53.837 --> 1:17:54.670
- We're going in.

1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:58.274
Now.

1:18:03.112 --> 1:18:04.380
Send everyone.

1:18:04.380 --> 1:18:06.615
- Take him before
I change my mind.

1:18:06.615 --> 1:18:08.517
Go on, son, get out of here.

1:18:09.652 --> 1:18:12.822
(soft dramatic music)

1:18:16.225 --> 1:18:17.994
- [Artemis] Let's go.

1:18:19.562 --> 1:18:22.465
(muffled speaking)

1:18:28.772 --> 1:18:30.473
- Go get the truck.

1:18:30.473 --> 1:18:31.908
- They coming?

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:33.910
- Fuck it, go get my boy.

1:18:33.910 --> 1:18:35.311
- Go, go, go, go, take him!

1:18:36.545 --> 1:18:40.316
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:18:52.929 --> 1:18:53.963
(engine revving)

1:18:53.963 --> 1:18:55.865
(tires squealing)

1:18:55.865 --> 1:18:58.234
(gun firing)

1:18:58.234 --> 1:18:59.435
- Dreds, cover me!

1:18:59.435 --> 1:19:01.871
(guns firing)

1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:19.122
(helicopter blade whirring)

1:19:19.122 --> 1:19:20.423
- [Police Officer] This
is the (muffled speaking).

1:19:20.423 --> 1:19:21.657
Drop your guns.

1:19:25.528 --> 1:19:28.131
(cops yelling)

1:19:34.603 --> 1:19:36.940
- What the fuck are they doing?

1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:38.174
You okay?
- Yeah.

1:19:46.983 --> 1:19:47.817
- What the fuck was that?

1:19:47.817 --> 1:19:49.052
You shooting at me?

1:19:49.052 --> 1:19:51.720
- Don't you know I'm
willing to do anything

1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:53.722
and everything for Max?

1:19:53.722 --> 1:19:55.591
- That makes two of us.

1:19:55.591 --> 1:19:56.826
They're shooting at Max.

1:19:58.094 --> 1:19:59.328
They're shooting at him.

1:19:59.328 --> 1:20:01.097
- I know what the
fuck they're doing.

1:20:01.097 --> 1:20:02.531
- Don't push me, Pop.

1:20:02.531 --> 1:20:04.200
I swear to God, don't push me.

1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:06.702
- Think about what
you're saying.

1:20:06.702 --> 1:20:08.371
How far are you willing to go?

1:20:09.538 --> 1:20:11.107
- As far as you want to go.

1:20:12.275 --> 1:20:14.510
- This motherfucker
hung up on me.

1:20:14.510 --> 1:20:17.546
Motherfucker, I
will bury your ass!

1:20:22.718 --> 1:20:24.520
(phone ringing)

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.822
- Artemis.
- We need to meet.

1:20:26.822 --> 1:20:27.991
- Sasha's MIA.

1:20:27.991 --> 1:20:29.525
Cash and Dreds are in prison.

1:20:30.459 --> 1:20:31.861
And your dad wants you dead.

1:20:33.429 --> 1:20:38.234
So you really don't
have anyone left.

1:20:40.069 --> 1:20:42.005
- Bakersfield, farmhouse.

1:20:43.239 --> 1:20:44.040
Come alone.

1:20:46.009 --> 1:20:48.878
(car horn honking)

1:21:10.466 --> 1:21:13.136
(hay crunching)

1:21:20.143 --> 1:21:20.977
You alone?

1:21:22.011 --> 1:21:23.279
- You'd know if I wasn't.

1:21:27.183 --> 1:21:28.684
- I need four things from you.

1:21:30.019 --> 1:21:32.688
One, let Cash go.

1:21:35.624 --> 1:21:36.459
That's two.

1:21:37.994 --> 1:21:41.564
Three, get your tail off of me.

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:45.234
- What do I get for this?

1:21:48.137 --> 1:21:48.938
- My father.

1:21:50.706 --> 1:21:52.541
- How do I know that
I can trust you?

1:21:56.812 --> 1:21:57.780
- You don't.

1:22:03.652 --> 1:22:06.789
(both laughing)

1:22:06.789 --> 1:22:07.790
- Artemis.

1:22:07.790 --> 1:22:10.059
- You can trust me, Decker.

1:22:11.427 --> 1:22:14.163
(Decker sighing)

1:22:17.466 --> 1:22:18.834
- Don't fuck with me.

1:22:23.239 --> 1:22:25.608
The way that I see it I
still owe you a bullet.

1:22:35.551 --> 1:22:39.288
- You never asked me
what the fourth one was.

1:22:40.723 --> 1:22:41.524
Time will come

1:22:46.996 --> 1:22:49.732
where I'm gonna need you to
help me find an old friend.

1:22:51.734 --> 1:22:55.204
(soft delicate guitar music)

1:22:55.204 --> 1:22:57.106
Can you do that for me?

1:23:23.899 --> 1:23:25.901
- We had him surrounded.

1:23:29.905 --> 1:23:33.642
I don't know how the
fuck this dude got away.

1:23:40.216 --> 1:23:41.117
- Where is he now?

1:23:44.587 --> 1:23:45.954
- Nobody seems to know.

1:24:26.462 --> 1:24:29.132
(phone ringing)

1:24:31.834 --> 1:24:33.035
- [Artemis] Last chance.

1:24:34.403 --> 1:24:35.338
- Fuck me.

1:24:37.005 --> 1:24:37.840
Deal.

1:24:42.645 --> 1:24:45.481
(water splashing)

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:13.276
(water splashing)

1:25:14.343 --> 1:25:17.246
(bottle squeaking)

1:25:18.614 --> 1:25:21.617
(alcohol splashing)

1:25:30.393 --> 1:25:31.760
(phone ringing)

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:33.796
- [Dreds] Yo, this is Dreds.

1:25:33.796 --> 1:25:36.064
- Yeah, I'm sending
nephew to pick you up.

1:25:36.064 --> 1:25:37.466
- [Dreds] Pick me up (laughs)?

1:25:38.501 --> 1:25:40.035
Which you mean pick me up?

1:25:40.035 --> 1:25:41.970
- Last chance to save yourself.

1:25:43.038 --> 1:25:44.207
He'll be there shortly.

1:25:44.207 --> 1:25:45.908
Get in the car.
- You don't even know

1:25:45.908 --> 1:25:47.009
where I am.

1:25:47.009 --> 1:25:48.311
- Negro please.

1:25:59.222 --> 1:26:02.090
- [Artemis] Max, stay here.

1:26:02.090 --> 1:26:03.592
- [Max] Okay, dad.

1:26:15.971 --> 1:26:16.805
- Find Sasha?

1:26:20.008 --> 1:26:20.843
- Not yet.

1:26:23.979 --> 1:26:25.648
- Why you call me here then?

1:26:25.648 --> 1:26:26.482
What are we doing?

1:26:26.482 --> 1:26:27.783
- T2 Ortega.

1:26:29.685 --> 1:26:33.489
Graduated head of his
class, highly decorated.

1:26:33.489 --> 1:26:35.224
Over 10 years of experience.

1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:39.995
Two years ago while
working a case in Haiti

1:26:41.497 --> 1:26:43.065
his cover was compromised.

1:26:44.333 --> 1:26:45.668
Unable to get their hands on him

1:26:45.668 --> 1:26:46.969
they captured his brother.

1:26:48.271 --> 1:26:50.473
Put him up for a five
million dollar ransom.

1:26:54.410 --> 1:26:57.012
Word on the street is that
to get that kind of money

1:26:59.848 --> 1:27:04.753
he kidnapped your son
and sold him to Olivier.

1:27:09.692 --> 1:27:11.226
During said transaction,

1:27:11.226 --> 1:27:13.296
a federal agent was
shot and killed.

1:27:17.466 --> 1:27:18.434
That agent was Ray.

1:27:28.110 --> 1:27:29.278
- Where is it?

1:27:30.713 --> 1:27:34.383
(soft dramatic piano music)

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:45.494
- A little advice,

1:27:47.630 --> 1:27:48.464
from a friend.

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:52.435
Let it go.

1:27:54.202 --> 1:27:55.838
You have everything
you need now.

1:27:58.273 --> 1:27:59.107
Let it go.

1:28:01.377 --> 1:28:04.547
(soft dramatic music)

1:28:05.981 --> 1:28:07.282
- I don't know how you keep
a lady (muffled speaking).

1:28:08.451 --> 1:28:10.218
If I ever tell 'em what
I do, forget about it.

1:28:10.218 --> 1:28:11.654
They're gone,
right out the door.

1:28:11.654 --> 1:28:12.888
- Tell 'em you're in
finance, that's what I do.

1:28:12.888 --> 1:28:13.822
- Right, right, I'm
an investment banker.

1:28:13.822 --> 1:28:15.057
I'm an investment banker.

1:28:15.057 --> 1:28:16.459
- Man, what in the
fuck is y'all doing?

1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:18.894
- Oh fuck.

1:28:18.894 --> 1:28:19.562
- Did y'all secure
the damn perimeter?

1:28:20.529 --> 1:28:21.797
Well?

1:28:21.797 --> 1:28:23.832
This motherfucker
could be anywhere.

1:28:23.832 --> 1:28:24.967
Hey, go left, man.

1:28:24.967 --> 1:28:26.101
Come on, let's go.

1:28:26.101 --> 1:28:27.035
Go right.
- All right, hey,

1:28:27.035 --> 1:28:27.836
take it easy.
- Go away.

1:28:27.836 --> 1:28:28.837
Take your ass right.

1:28:28.837 --> 1:28:29.772
Trying to get me
killed out here.

1:28:29.772 --> 1:28:30.138
They pay me for this shit!

1:28:32.741 --> 1:28:34.910
God damn, I forgot to
check the fucking gate.

1:28:39.548 --> 1:28:42.117
(gun clicking)

1:28:43.386 --> 1:28:44.219
- Son.

1:28:51.059 --> 1:28:54.930
There's a bullet pointed
at your head right now.

1:28:57.600 --> 1:28:59.502
If you even breath,

1:29:00.803 --> 1:29:02.605
that bullet will
stop your heart.

1:29:03.639 --> 1:29:04.740
You know me, son.

1:29:06.875 --> 1:29:08.577
And you know how
I feel about Max.

1:29:11.814 --> 1:29:13.949
- I know how I feel
about him too, Pop.

1:29:15.918 --> 1:29:20.823
- Son, you can't protect him.

1:29:20.823 --> 1:29:21.657
You know that.

1:29:25.828 --> 1:29:27.430
Last chance.

1:29:29.732 --> 1:29:30.966
Where is he?

1:29:35.738 --> 1:29:39.107
(Olivier sighing)

1:29:39.107 --> 1:29:40.843
Look, give him back.

1:29:42.110 --> 1:29:44.312
I promise I'll let
you walk out of here.

1:29:50.018 --> 1:29:51.019
- No, you won't.

1:29:53.221 --> 1:29:56.391
(soft dramatic music)

1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:05.768
- You're right.

1:30:08.437 --> 1:30:09.271
I won't.

1:30:13.208 --> 1:30:14.209
Goodbye son.

1:30:18.146 --> 1:30:20.549
(gun firing)

1:30:24.352 --> 1:30:25.521
- Goodbye dad.

1:30:27.456 --> 1:30:31.527
(soft dramatic orchestral music)

1:30:39.401 --> 1:30:42.104
(sirens blaring)

1:30:45.841 --> 1:30:49.211
(intense dramatic music)

1:31:06.328 --> 1:31:07.395
- Shoot them!

1:31:07.395 --> 1:31:08.564
(gun firing)

1:31:08.564 --> 1:31:09.898
Hey!

1:31:09.898 --> 1:31:12.400
(guns firing)

1:31:15.938 --> 1:31:17.540
Fuck!

1:31:17.540 --> 1:31:20.275
(sirens blaring)

1:31:32.821 --> 1:31:34.022
- Decker.

1:31:34.022 --> 1:31:34.823
- Artemis.

1:31:38.026 --> 1:31:39.427
- See you got your job back.

1:31:48.203 --> 1:31:49.672
- I got a promotion.

1:31:55.944 --> 1:31:57.445
- (laughs) Is that right?

1:31:59.481 --> 1:32:00.282
- That's right.

1:32:10.158 --> 1:32:11.326
You know, when I
asked for Olivier,

1:32:11.326 --> 1:32:14.396
I didn't mean in a pine box.

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:19.568
- I lived up to my
end of the bargain.

1:32:23.606 --> 1:32:24.940
- I'll deliver on mine too.

1:32:28.577 --> 1:32:29.745
- I'm waiting.

1:32:35.618 --> 1:32:36.451
Find her.

1:32:38.453 --> 1:32:42.390
(soft delicate dramatic music)

1:32:53.268 --> 1:32:55.971
(engine revving)

1:33:03.411 --> 1:33:05.981
- Can I ask you a question?

1:33:05.981 --> 1:33:06.815
- Shoot.

1:33:08.550 --> 1:33:10.518
- How much did you
pay to get me back?

1:33:11.887 --> 1:33:13.155
- Get you back?

1:33:13.155 --> 1:33:15.290
Shit, they paid me
to take you back.

1:33:15.290 --> 1:33:18.126
(both laughing)

1:33:18.126 --> 1:33:20.696
- You know, I'm real glad
you came and got me, bro.

1:33:21.764 --> 1:33:22.898
- I told you I would.

1:33:22.898 --> 1:33:24.199
- It took you long enough.

1:33:30.105 --> 1:33:32.507
- Nobody touched you, did they?

1:33:32.507 --> 1:33:33.441
You can tell me if they did?

1:33:33.441 --> 1:33:34.276
- No.

1:33:35.510 --> 1:33:36.311
I'm good.

1:33:38.681 --> 1:33:41.049
- Whatever happened to
you before I got to you,

1:33:43.151 --> 1:33:43.986
I got you now.

1:33:47.022 --> 1:33:48.256
- [T's Brother] What is it?

1:33:49.725 --> 1:33:50.959
- Nothing.

1:33:50.959 --> 1:33:53.729
It's time for you to go to bed.

1:33:53.729 --> 1:33:55.297
- Oh, come on big bro.

1:33:55.297 --> 1:33:56.298
- Come on, let's go.

1:33:56.298 --> 1:33:58.400
Call it a night, come on.

1:34:00.202 --> 1:34:03.305
(soft dramatic music)

1:34:11.046 --> 1:34:14.149
- You know, it feels
good to be home.

1:34:17.019 --> 1:34:18.586
Goodnight, bro.

1:34:18.586 --> 1:34:19.587
- Goodnight.

1:34:27.996 --> 1:34:29.031
- You didn't think I'd
forget about you now,

1:34:29.031 --> 1:34:29.865
did ya?

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:33.668
- What are the chances

1:34:33.668 --> 1:34:35.603
if I promise you'll
never see me again,

1:34:35.603 --> 1:34:37.405
you'll let me pass
and go on my way?

1:34:39.307 --> 1:34:40.308
- Slim to none.

1:34:40.308 --> 1:34:41.977
Slim just took a
cigarette break.

1:34:47.649 --> 1:34:49.351
- It's crazy what you'll
do for someone you love.

1:34:49.351 --> 1:34:50.819
- [Artemis] Tell me about it.

1:34:54.122 --> 1:34:55.457
- [T] I'm sorry.

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:06.601
- [Artemis] Me too.

1:35:10.405 --> 1:35:11.940
- [T] Damn.

1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:13.475
(fist thwacking)

1:35:13.475 --> 1:35:15.643
(both grunting)

1:35:15.643 --> 1:35:18.213
(both yelling)

1:35:19.347 --> 1:35:22.017
(foot thumping)

1:35:23.786 --> 1:35:25.320
(Artemis screaming)

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:26.388
(fist thwacking)

1:35:26.388 --> 1:35:29.057
(both grunting)

1:35:30.993 --> 1:35:32.527
I said let him go!

1:35:32.527 --> 1:35:33.628
But you say no!

1:35:33.628 --> 1:35:34.529
Now you do!

1:35:35.397 --> 1:35:38.834
(both grunting)

1:35:38.834 --> 1:35:41.669
(fists thwacking)

1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:54.682
(gun firing)

1:35:54.682 --> 1:35:58.453
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1:36:06.628 --> 1:36:09.431
- [Artemis] Where you going?

1:36:09.431 --> 1:36:11.099
(gun firing)

1:36:11.099 --> 1:36:12.634
Where you going?

1:36:12.634 --> 1:36:13.836
(gun firing)

1:36:13.836 --> 1:36:14.669
Hm, hm?

1:36:17.672 --> 1:36:18.941
Where you going?

1:36:18.941 --> 1:36:21.343
(gun firing)

1:36:36.391 --> 1:36:40.062
(soft dramatic piano music)

1:37:36.751 --> 1:37:40.655
(intense dramatic piano music)

1:37:43.691 --> 1:37:46.528
(muffled singing)

1:38:24.032 --> 1:38:28.937
* Come back come back

1:38:28.937 --> 1:38:31.273
* Come back
