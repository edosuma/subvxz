WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.310
I believe there are things
beyond comprehension.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.910
Is one of those things
god? I don't know.

00:06.950 --> 00:09.860
Why do you find it hard to believe?

00:10.596 --> 00:12.630
Wherever they went,
wherever they took rachel,

00:12.665 --> 00:13.798
They could be anywhere by now.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.618
We keep asking where they took her,

00:15.653 --> 00:16.963
But we haven't asked why.

00:16.998 --> 00:18.239
Can you tell me where I am?

00:18.274 --> 00:20.564
A waiting room. A waiting room for what?

00:20.599 --> 00:23.089
We remove the genetic
information, put it in vitro,

00:23.124 --> 00:24.424
And let natural birth occur.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.416
And she carries the child. Now it's time

00:26.451 --> 00:29.232
With the one that'll
actually bear the son of god.

00:29.267 --> 00:30.702
Rachel, where
- Where are you?

00:30.737 --> 00:32.101
I'm in some monastery somewhere.

00:32.137 --> 00:34.710
I brought some people to
see you. They can help.

00:34.745 --> 00:35.962
We're gonna go there,

00:35.997 --> 00:37.990
And we're gonna bring rachel home.

00:38.986 --> 00:40.770
Something's happening.

00:40.805 --> 00:42.520
I want to be fixed.

00:42.555 --> 00:45.336
I can fix you, but you
need to do one last thing.

00:45.371 --> 00:47.909
You want me to kill.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.829
<i>Zero is the number of mystery,</i>

00:57.864 --> 01:00.368
<i>An hour with no friend.</i>

01:00.403 --> 01:03.225
<i>Sometimes it's the beginning.</i>

You're gonna get us in trouble.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.574
You're already in trouble.

02:05.609 --> 02:07.394
This place is not what you think it is.

02:07.429 --> 02:09.137
We have to get out of here.

02:28.355 --> 02:30.741
You have the most uncanny ability

02:30.776 --> 02:33.127
To show up at just the right time.

02:33.162 --> 02:34.497
Thank you.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.719
There's something I'm going to do now,

02:41.754 --> 02:44.542
Something I don't want you to see.

02:44.577 --> 02:48.243
But in return of doing this,

02:48.278 --> 02:50.809
I'm going to get that woman to fix you,

02:50.844 --> 02:53.673
Just as she's going to fix me.

02:53.708 --> 02:56.371
Would you like that?

02:59.069 --> 03:01.808
We'll be fine, you and me. I promise.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.708
I say we stay.

03:07.743 --> 03:10.940
Ms. Lynch knows what's best for us.

03:12.766 --> 03:15.423
Did ms. Lynch know
what was best for yamin?

03:15.458 --> 03:18.494
Aren't you wondering where she is?

03:18.529 --> 03:20.486
Why she never came back?

03:21.482 --> 03:23.184
She's right.

03:24.927 --> 03:27.957
The time has come for
us to leave this place.

04:17.308 --> 04:18.512
This way.

04:26.315 --> 04:27.893
This is just like the
door to my apartment.

04:27.928 --> 04:30.223
12 handles?

04:30.258 --> 04:32.333
12... like the numbers on a clock.

04:32.368 --> 04:34.000
Seriously?

04:34.035 --> 04:36.111
Does everything have to be
about a clock with you people?

04:36.146 --> 04:38.452
Is that what this is? Another puzzle?

04:38.487 --> 04:40.724
12 possible ways to open the door.

04:40.759 --> 04:43.789
Actually, if it's not
about the right handle,

04:43.824 --> 04:45.082
But the right order of handles,

04:45.117 --> 04:47.276
Then there's thousands of possible ways.

04:47.311 --> 04:49.143
We don't have that kind of time.

04:49.178 --> 04:52.049
A lion... a castle...

04:52.084 --> 04:53.300
A ship.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.252
Like they're telling some kind of story.

04:55.287 --> 04:57.818
Well, maybe if we could
figure out the story...

04:57.853 --> 04:59.645
We could figure out the way in.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.583
It's locked.

05:06.618 --> 05:08.900
All right, the one thing that we learned

05:08.935 --> 05:10.069
From the puzzles in the clocks

05:10.104 --> 05:12.304
Is that the answers
always had something to do

05:12.339 --> 05:14.130
With who designed them, right?

05:14.165 --> 05:15.175
So who designed this?

05:15.210 --> 05:16.876
It had to be a true believer,

05:16.911 --> 05:18.695
Someone who thought that this was where

05:18.730 --> 05:20.445
They were gonna greet the apocalypse.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.593
Gentlemen, I want to thank
you for your dedicated service.

05:23.628 --> 05:25.665
We've waited long for this moment,

05:25.700 --> 05:27.702
And the time is finally upon us.

05:27.737 --> 05:30.573
It is as it is written.

05:30.608 --> 05:33.658
Okay, new testament
- When jesus returned,

05:33.693 --> 05:37.297
Do we know who was chosen
to ascend to heaven?

05:37.332 --> 05:40.901
The descendents of the
12 tribes of israel.

05:51.693 --> 05:54.937
God...

05:54.972 --> 05:57.421
It's coming.

05:57.456 --> 05:58.874
What?

06:00.659 --> 06:03.149
The end.

06:19.751 --> 06:21.619
We need to keep moving.
Go back the other way.

06:21.654 --> 06:24.856
Wait. I hear someone coming.

06:31.497 --> 06:33.248
Check all the doors.

06:33.283 --> 06:35.524
Check all the doors. We need to hide.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.560
Come on, this way, this way. Shh! Shh!

06:47.595 --> 06:49.635
Come on. Come on. Come on.

07:02.295 --> 07:05.076
Shh! Stay quiet.

07:05.111 --> 07:07.822
It's gonna be okay.

07:07.857 --> 07:11.800
12 tribes of israel. 12
handles, one for each tribe.

07:11.835 --> 07:13.550
That tree-

07:13.585 --> 07:16.096
That's the symbol for
the tribe of asher.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.607
And the flower... the tribe of reuben.

07:18.642 --> 07:20.803
The tribe of judah, isaac.

07:20.838 --> 07:22.930
Joseph. They all match.

07:22.965 --> 07:24.958
Okay, so which handle do we pull?

07:24.993 --> 07:27.538
Genesis. 35.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.768
The birth of jacob's
sons. There was an order.

07:30.803 --> 07:32.096
Reuben was first.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.496
Simeon was next. The city symbol.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.356
Whoa, hey, hey, hey. You're
doing something right.

07:45.710 --> 07:46.873
Judah the lion.

07:48.616 --> 07:51.729
Issachar. Zebulun.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.354
Joseph.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.610
Benjamin. And...

07:55.645 --> 07:57.734
Dan and naphtali.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.823
Gad, asher...

08:06.879 --> 08:09.037
Welcome to new jerusalem.

08:34.895 --> 08:37.095
Okay, we'll check each
room. Clear them one by one.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.669
Follow my lead.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.332
I know you're frightened.
Why shouldn't you be?

08:51.367 --> 08:53.282
I'm here to take your life.

08:54.985 --> 08:57.973
But I'm going to give
one of you a chance

08:58.008 --> 09:00.878
To no longer be afraid.

09:00.913 --> 09:02.752
Just come forward,

09:02.787 --> 09:04.738
Show me where you're hiding,

09:04.773 --> 09:07.395
And you'll be spared.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.588
What the hell is this?

09:39.164 --> 09:41.820
Rebecca. Hands on your head. Now!

09:41.855 --> 09:43.683
He's okay. He's not armed.

09:43.718 --> 09:45.511
Tell me
- Are we too late?

09:45.546 --> 09:47.602
For what?

09:47.637 --> 09:49.659
Conception.

09:52.313 --> 09:53.309
Yes.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.998
Stop! Put the guns down now!

09:59.033 --> 10:01.024
This man will answer for his sins.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.006
Then I guess we all will.

10:07.164 --> 10:09.866
What about you, rachel?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.892
Do you want to see hank again?

10:23.050 --> 10:25.042
Do you want to see the boy with the hair

10:25.077 --> 10:27.122
That seems quite fond of you?

10:27.157 --> 10:29.397
Do you want them to welcome you home,

10:29.432 --> 10:31.512
Or cry at your funeral?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.167
It's up to you.

10:39.685 --> 10:41.592
There you are.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.002
Move aside.

10:51.037 --> 10:52.283
We have no quarrel with you.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.786
Harm him, and you will.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.735
Rebecca, you don't have to do this.

10:56.770 --> 10:58.514
The whole way over here
I've reminded myself

10:58.549 --> 10:59.975
What the book tells us-

11:00.010 --> 11:02.647
"Judge not, and you
shall not be judged."

11:02.682 --> 11:05.285
It also tells, "the
wages of sin is death."

11:05.320 --> 11:07.036
"But if ye do not forgive,

11:07.071 --> 11:08.899
"Neither will your father in heaven

11:08.934 --> 11:10.485
Forgive your trespasses."

11:10.520 --> 11:13.926
Now, we all know you've done
your share of trespassing.

11:15.712 --> 11:18.619
You sure you wanna roll the
dice so close to judgment day?

11:32.951 --> 11:34.986
What are you
- What are you doing here?

11:35.021 --> 11:36.815
We're looking for someone. A girl.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.151
Oh, uh, your friend. I was-

11:38.186 --> 11:39.639
I was here when they brought her in.

11:39.674 --> 11:41.557
Is she okay? I, uh...

11:41.592 --> 11:44.375
I
- I don't know. Um... white vincent...

11:45.578 --> 11:47.656
Lynch sent him to...

11:47.691 --> 11:49.235
To what?

11:50.772 --> 11:52.642
Sent vincent to do what?!

11:54.178 --> 11:55.985
Turn around.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.792
Face the wall.

12:02.195 --> 12:04.481
All of you.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.640
No...

12:07.762 --> 12:09.347
I want you to look me in the eye

12:09.382 --> 12:11.625
When you execute these innocent girls...

12:12.664 --> 12:15.031
So you never forget this moment.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.393
I don't want to do this, believe me.

12:19.428 --> 12:21.684
But an agreement was made.

12:21.719 --> 12:24.585
<i>This is about keeping your word?</i>

12:24.620 --> 12:27.416
It's about keeping my sight.

12:27.451 --> 12:30.527
You don't know me
- Or my situation.

12:32.312 --> 12:36.182
You're right, I don't.

12:36.217 --> 12:39.499
But I do know that right
now you have a choice,

12:39.534 --> 12:41.748
And you're gonna have to live with it.

12:41.783 --> 12:45.813
Unfortunately, I had
to live with far worse.

12:52.460 --> 12:56.365
What are you doing? I
told you not to follow me.

13:06.085 --> 13:09.865
My choice just became...

13:09.900 --> 13:11.693
Much easier.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.385
All right, they kept the girls in a dorm

13:17.420 --> 13:18.845
Somewhere in this area,

13:18.880 --> 13:21.122
But now that lynch doesn't
need them anymore...

13:21.157 --> 13:23.548
Wh-What do you mean, doesn't need them?

13:23.583 --> 13:26.735
They're just guinea pigs, lab rats.

13:26.770 --> 13:29.887
The seed-It's... it's in her now.

13:29.922 --> 13:32.054
In lynch? Yes.

13:32.089 --> 13:33.508
But there's something...

13:33.543 --> 13:35.584
Uh, I was analyzing her lab work,

13:35.619 --> 13:37.862
Uh, just to make sure
everything was still stable,

13:37.897 --> 13:39.894
And...

13:39.929 --> 13:41.857
It's not.

13:41.892 --> 13:43.699
The cells-They're mutating.

13:43.734 --> 13:45.845
Whatever's inside of her,

13:45.880 --> 13:47.957
I don't think it's a child.

13:49.703 --> 13:53.648
I swear to god, if they've
done anything to ray...

13:53.683 --> 13:55.722
Rebecca.

13:55.757 --> 13:57.726
This way.

13:57.761 --> 13:59.360
Where are you going?

13:59.395 --> 14:00.925
To get us a ride.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.710
I figure once you get those girls,

14:02.745 --> 14:05.654
We're gonna need a
way out of here, right?

14:05.689 --> 14:07.198
There's only one place here

14:07.233 --> 14:09.143
Where you can get a
call out to civilization.

14:09.178 --> 14:11.261
It's... it's pretty secure, but...

14:12.716 --> 14:13.796
Beck.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.160
Be careful.

14:19.154 --> 14:21.480
Tell rachel I'll see her soon.

14:24.221 --> 14:26.340
Keep an eye out for vincent.

14:27.504 --> 14:30.293
It's done.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.654
I'm ready to be fixed now.

14:32.689 --> 14:34.946
The girls
- Did they suffer?

14:34.981 --> 14:38.346
Oh, there's no such
thing as a painless death.

14:38.381 --> 14:40.679
I suggest you remember that

14:40.714 --> 14:43.081
Before answering my next question.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.986
Have you lied to me?

14:47.021 --> 14:49.018
Vincent, I don't have-

14:49.053 --> 14:51.015
It's a yes or no question!

14:52.055 --> 14:53.557
See, I recently learned

14:53.592 --> 14:56.006
You may not have the ability

14:56.041 --> 14:58.659
To repair the damage you've done to me.

14:58.694 --> 15:00.774
Is that true?

15:00.809 --> 15:02.819
Yes, vincent.

15:02.854 --> 15:06.054
There is no way for me to fix you.

15:06.089 --> 15:07.846
But worry not.

15:07.881 --> 15:10.125
Soon you will be perfect

15:10.160 --> 15:12.367
In the eyes of god.

15:13.532 --> 15:15.405
Mm. Seems neither of us

15:15.440 --> 15:18.681
Have been honest with the other.

15:25.078 --> 15:29.814
I may... perhaps kill you in her place.

15:29.849 --> 15:31.684
They say in the land of the blind,

15:31.719 --> 15:33.470
The one-Eyed man is king.

15:34.550 --> 15:38.205
But what of the man with no eyes?

15:38.240 --> 15:39.867
What becomes of him?

16:01.510 --> 16:04.750
Come here!

16:06.204 --> 16:08.529
Enough!

16:15.925 --> 16:18.464
This man's blood is pure.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.455
A descendant of the 12 tribes.

16:21.490 --> 16:25.728
It would be wrong for
us to take his life.

16:28.219 --> 16:30.547
Let the cold do it.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.615
No one's here.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.642
So where can they be?

17:28.259 --> 17:30.217
That man-

17:30.252 --> 17:31.911
What do you think he's doing with alima?

17:31.946 --> 17:33.163
I don't know.

17:33.198 --> 17:34.652
But we're not gonna find
out by staying in here,

17:34.687 --> 17:36.153
So come on, help me.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.803
With mr. Vincent now unavailable,

17:38.838 --> 17:41.419
I need someone to clean up his mess.

17:41.454 --> 17:42.707
The girl.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.939
With each breath, she gives air

17:48.974 --> 17:52.336
To that abomination inside her womb.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.699
There can be only one child, jacob.

17:55.734 --> 17:57.815
Of course. It's just that...

17:57.850 --> 17:59.850
What?

18:00.971 --> 18:02.017
The men-

18:02.052 --> 18:04.292
They're unwilling to harm her.

18:05.579 --> 18:06.789
Unwilling?

18:06.824 --> 18:08.740
She's a holy vessel.

18:08.775 --> 18:11.474
They'd rather die today
than be damned for eternity.

18:16.706 --> 18:18.843
Alima, darling,

18:18.878 --> 18:20.946
Come to me.

18:20.981 --> 18:23.720
It's time we had a talk...

18:23.755 --> 18:29.087
Woman to woman.

18:29.122 --> 18:32.855
On the count of three.
Three, two, one...

18:32.890 --> 18:35.382
Shh, shh, shh. There it is again.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.875
I think it's coming from there. Yeah.

18:41.610 --> 18:43.441
Excuse me, who are you?

18:43.476 --> 18:46.006
This isn't good, hank.
There's no problem here.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.579
Wait. Hank?!

18:47.614 --> 18:48.884
Rachel?!

18:48.919 --> 18:50.120
Arron!

18:50.155 --> 18:52.230
We're in here! I'm in here!

18:52.265 --> 18:54.305
No, arron! No, no, no, arron!

18:55.673 --> 18:56.960
No!

19:01.896 --> 19:02.773
You all right?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.484
So... that happened.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.161
Ahh. Oh, god. Let's go.

19:08.196 --> 19:09.992
Rachel? Rachel?

19:10.027 --> 19:11.936
Rachel? Hank? Arron? I'm-I'm in here!

19:18.948 --> 19:20.904
Oh, my god, are you okay?

19:20.939 --> 19:22.729
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

19:22.764 --> 19:24.922
You're bleeding from the
face. I'm fine, I'm fine.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.127
You came for me.

19:27.162 --> 19:29.527
Well, don't let it go to your head.

19:29.562 --> 19:31.192
If I had a dollar

19:31.227 --> 19:32.472
For every girl I
rescued from a monastery

19:32.507 --> 19:34.464
In tajikistan, I'd be-

19:38.240 --> 19:40.065
Okay, we need to get out of here.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.890
Come on, everybody. Everyone, out.

19:41.925 --> 19:43.051
Let's go, out. Out.

20:05.994 --> 20:08.359
I pray this is god's work.

20:08.394 --> 20:10.273
Yeah, we all do.

20:10.308 --> 20:11.988
It's okay. It's okay. Lynch sent me.

20:12.023 --> 20:13.634
She asked me to bring her the sat phone.

20:13.669 --> 20:16.324
You know you're not allowed
outside the lab unescorted.

20:16.359 --> 20:18.814
Uh, actually, you are right,

20:18.849 --> 20:22.008
But... I'm not alone.

20:32.794 --> 20:35.000
We got a signal.

20:35.035 --> 20:36.984
You are not the person I remember.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.851
Yeah, neither are you.

20:40.719 --> 20:42.046
Okay, rebecca, you have to understand

20:42.081 --> 20:43.706
The things they did to me.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.409
The only way I could survive

20:46.444 --> 20:47.771
Was to remove any part
of me they could hurt.

20:47.806 --> 20:49.229
Knowing I was gonna spend

20:49.264 --> 20:51.304
The rest of my life without you

20:51.339 --> 20:54.740
Was more pain than I could stand, so...

20:57.023 --> 20:58.703
I had to stop.

20:58.738 --> 21:00.383
Stop what?

21:03.079 --> 21:04.739
Loving you.

21:06.523 --> 21:08.763
I thought you were dead.

21:08.798 --> 21:11.757
I never stopped.

21:11.792 --> 21:15.153
Come on. We have to call the cavalry.

21:22.911 --> 21:25.483
The woman. Lynch.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.020
Where is she?

21:28.055 --> 21:30.508
Do you know some churches have removed

21:30.543 --> 21:33.426
Their fonts of holy
water because they fear

21:33.461 --> 21:36.310
It's a source of bacterial
and viral infection?

21:36.345 --> 21:39.107
We've reached the point when even

21:39.142 --> 21:41.869
Something blessed, something holy

21:41.904 --> 21:44.542
Can be harmful to us.

21:44.577 --> 21:47.145
The water in here-

21:47.180 --> 21:49.592
It's colder than normal.

21:49.627 --> 21:51.661
Perhaps your body's just warmer.

21:51.696 --> 21:53.773
Mother, it hurts.

21:53.808 --> 21:55.851
Can't you feel it?

22:00.581 --> 22:02.578
Wh...

22:02.613 --> 22:03.900
What is happening?

22:05.890 --> 22:09.300
You... are happening, alima.

22:09.335 --> 22:12.528
There's something unholy
growing inside you.

22:12.563 --> 22:14.029
That's not true.

22:14.064 --> 22:16.346
I gave you clothes, shelter, love.

22:16.381 --> 22:19.889
Now what I give you is truth.

22:19.924 --> 22:23.363
What you've just witnessed

22:23.398 --> 22:26.053
Is the beginning of
the end for all of us.

22:27.132 --> 22:28.673
Unless...

22:28.708 --> 22:30.867
You have the courage,

22:30.902 --> 22:32.771
The grace

22:32.806 --> 22:34.641
To save us.

22:36.094 --> 22:37.588
How?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.188
By taking your life.

22:53.601 --> 22:55.177
I thought suicide was a sin.

22:55.212 --> 22:57.051
There's suicide,

22:57.086 --> 22:59.368
And there's sacrifice.

23:00.322 --> 23:02.313
God condemns one, but...

23:02.348 --> 23:04.269
He rewards the other.

23:04.304 --> 23:08.039
Ms. Lynch. We have uninvited
guests inside the walls.

23:08.074 --> 23:10.784
Shepherds? Perhaps.

23:10.819 --> 23:12.228
How would you like me to handle it?

23:36.622 --> 23:38.574
The old man said she's in the chapel,

23:38.609 --> 23:40.481
Just across this courtyard.

24:08.651 --> 24:11.327
We're gonna have to turn around!

24:11.362 --> 24:13.968
Wait, wh-What happened? Never mind.

24:14.003 --> 24:16.741
Is there another way to
get to the front gate? Wait.

24:16.776 --> 24:18.615
There's someone else in there.

24:18.650 --> 24:21.477
Her name is alima. I
know this sounds crazy,

24:21.512 --> 24:23.005
But they took her from the
room and when she came back,

24:23.040 --> 24:24.785
There was something different about her.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.496
I don't know what it was, but there was

24:26.531 --> 24:28.399
Something different, and if
what we've been talking about

24:28.434 --> 24:29.733
This whole time is true,

24:29.768 --> 24:31.594
Then I think she's carrying it.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.088
The child.

24:34.123 --> 24:36.495
Are... are you sure?

24:36.530 --> 24:40.015
As sure as you can be
about something impossible.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.078
All right. I want you
guys to head for the gate.

24:46.113 --> 24:48.645
W
- Wait, what are you doing? I'm gonna go back in for her.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.760
Hank, wh
- It's gonna be all right.

24:50.795 --> 24:52.467
Just get to the front gate.

24:52.502 --> 24:53.622
All right, come on, come on. Shh, shh.

24:53.657 --> 24:55.611
Beck should be there. Okay.

24:55.646 --> 24:57.530
Hank, hank, wait, wait.

24:57.565 --> 24:59.803
Are you going in there for this girl,

24:59.838 --> 25:01.795
Or is it something more?

25:03.289 --> 25:06.069
You don't have to be a believer...

25:06.104 --> 25:08.018
To believe.

25:54.649 --> 25:56.103
Thank you.

26:07.677 --> 26:10.961
You sure this is the right way?

26:10.996 --> 26:13.485
Why don't you just
tell me which way to go?

26:14.854 --> 26:16.729
I'm afraid he can't tell you anything.

26:16.764 --> 26:19.460
He has been robbed of
that particular privilege.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.540
And you had him bring me here?

26:21.575 --> 26:24.527
No, the boy found you
entirely on his own.

26:24.562 --> 26:29.209
It seems that he developed
a certain fondness of me.

26:29.244 --> 26:32.030
You have two seconds to
tell me what you want.

26:32.065 --> 26:33.903
I want to help you.

26:33.938 --> 26:36.013
From where I'm standing, you
don't look like much help.

26:36.048 --> 26:39.704
Let me guess. You want
to rescue that girl alima?

26:41.033 --> 26:44.441
Oh. A noble man is
always so easy to predict.

26:44.476 --> 26:47.214
You've always been noble
- This life and the last.

26:47.249 --> 26:48.755
What those men did in 1938

26:48.790 --> 26:50.664
Has nothing to do with what we do today.

26:50.699 --> 26:53.977
Oh, we could spend hours
debating fate and destiny.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.877
But I don't think we
have hours to spare.

26:56.912 --> 26:59.708
There's only one door into that chapel.

26:59.743 --> 27:04.638
Well guarded. To get through
it, men have to be killed.

27:04.673 --> 27:06.730
Are you up for the task?

27:06.765 --> 27:08.752
You could leave me here

27:08.787 --> 27:11.277
And try to kill those men on your own.

27:11.312 --> 27:13.234
Or release me,

27:13.269 --> 27:17.999
And allow me to do what I
was put on this earth to do,

27:18.034 --> 27:20.256
And we all might have a chance

27:20.291 --> 27:22.444
To come out of here alive.

27:22.479 --> 27:25.818
We're dealing with a monster, hank.

27:25.853 --> 27:29.158
Only a monster can best a monster.

27:53.050 --> 27:54.966
I wonder if this was god's plan for us,

27:55.001 --> 27:56.512
A resurrection of sorts,

27:56.547 --> 27:59.796
Because we didn't finish
what we were supposed to do

27:59.831 --> 28:02.210
The first time-

28:04.043 --> 28:06.457
To protect the blood of his son in 1938.

28:08.538 --> 28:10.932
So maybe he brought us back...

28:10.967 --> 28:13.327
To finish the job more properly.

28:16.658 --> 28:19.905
You're starting to sound
like a believer, vincent.

28:21.404 --> 28:24.319
For once in life, call me brother.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.808
They say these were born of the saplings

28:44.843 --> 28:46.643
From the tree of life.

28:46.678 --> 28:48.409
It's... beautiful.

28:48.444 --> 28:51.503
The purest things always are.

28:51.538 --> 28:56.100
Unfortunately, you,
alima, are not so pure.

28:56.135 --> 28:59.647
Which is why the beast
has come to our doorstep.

28:59.682 --> 29:02.163
But I... I didn't do anything.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.498
Of course, dear. None
of this is your fault-

29:04.533 --> 29:07.513
The ground trembling beneath our feet,

29:07.548 --> 29:11.521
Your very hands turning
blessed water to ice.

29:11.556 --> 29:13.325
We should have known...

29:13.360 --> 29:15.575
What would occur if we gave this gift

29:15.610 --> 29:18.300
To someone who was not chosen.

29:18.335 --> 29:21.600
But just as the son of
god died for our sins,

29:23.100 --> 29:24.273
So must you.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.367
We'll never get across
there. It's suicide.

29:40.402 --> 29:43.686
I believe the israelites
said the same to moses, yes?

29:43.721 --> 29:45.811
Thing is, moses could see.

29:45.846 --> 29:48.132
Well, it wasn't his sight
that helped him cross.

29:49.752 --> 29:51.795
Now, come.

29:51.830 --> 29:53.457
You have to go now.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.486
You wait for me outside the gates.

29:55.521 --> 29:57.106
I won't fail you.

29:57.141 --> 29:58.163
Go.

29:58.198 --> 29:59.185
Go!

30:13.770 --> 30:16.222
It's time for you to show yourselves.

30:52.871 --> 30:55.240
Come on.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.274
Easy.

30:57.309 --> 30:59.273
Got you.

31:01.141 --> 31:04.009
I'm trying to decide if
that was incredibly brave

31:04.044 --> 31:05.302
Or incredibly foolish.

31:05.337 --> 31:08.247
Most of the time, they are the same.

31:08.282 --> 31:09.998
Take the higher path,

31:10.033 --> 31:14.064
And you will live forever
in the kingdom of his grace.

31:14.099 --> 31:16.522
Turn your back on him,

31:16.557 --> 31:18.677
And you'll burn with the rest.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.592
W
- Wait! Stop!

31:35.838 --> 31:37.084
Put the knife down.

31:38.415 --> 31:40.085
Stay still, my lamb.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.173
A nonbeliever's come to prey
on your doubts and fears.

31:43.208 --> 31:46.275
Don't listen to her. You
know what has to be done.

31:46.310 --> 31:49.343
Shed light on the darkness
that grows inside you!

31:49.378 --> 31:51.381
Whatever darkness she's talking about-

31:51.416 --> 31:53.001
It grows in her.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.712
Liar.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.905
I've seen the lab reports, melanie.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.865
Your cells are mutating.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.559
Whatever life you think you're carrying,

32:01.594 --> 32:04.718
It's devouring you from the inside.

32:04.753 --> 32:07.668
Lies!

32:10.992 --> 32:13.153
I thought you were a
woman of science, melanie.

32:13.188 --> 32:15.314
But now you don't
believe what it tells you?

32:15.349 --> 32:17.731
I am a woman of faith!

32:17.766 --> 32:19.974
Who uses science to play god.

32:20.009 --> 32:23.168
And right now, both
of them are telling you

32:23.203 --> 32:26.406
Alima is healthy and you are sick.

32:26.441 --> 32:29.609
I will not have my beliefs questioned

32:29.644 --> 32:32.524
By someone who has none!

32:32.559 --> 32:35.301
If you want proof that something
miraculous is occurring,

32:35.336 --> 32:37.255
You don't get it from a lab report

32:37.290 --> 32:38.705
Or from a microscope.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.121
You get it from above!

32:41.825 --> 32:44.818
I watched her turn water to ice.

32:44.853 --> 32:46.736
She carries the beast!

32:46.771 --> 32:49.679
She carries the cold
that cannot be colder!

32:49.714 --> 32:52.172
Look around you! Can't you see?!

33:02.312 --> 33:03.766
Oh, god!

33:04.806 --> 33:05.968
No!

33:10.913 --> 33:13.533
Oh, god!

33:15.318 --> 33:16.696
No!

33:16.731 --> 33:19.224
We need to move.

33:20.222 --> 33:22.181
Let's go.

33:22.216 --> 33:26.911
Go. Allow a blind old lion
a final moment of grace.

33:26.946 --> 33:29.653
See you in the next life, brother.

33:30.693 --> 33:32.770
I hope so, brother.

33:38.462 --> 33:40.478
Let's meet our maker.

33:40.513 --> 33:42.494
I've made my peace.

33:42.529 --> 33:43.907
Have you?

33:49.891 --> 33:51.263
Hank! Hey!

33:51.298 --> 33:52.681
Hank!

33:52.716 --> 33:55.833
What the hell is going
on? Is this the end?

34:45.364 --> 34:47.444
Move! Move!

34:49.023 --> 34:51.100
Come on, come on!

34:51.135 --> 34:54.132
Hank!

34:56.210 --> 34:57.956
Give me your hand! There you go!

35:43.540 --> 35:45.908
Be right back, okay?

35:49.441 --> 35:50.861
So what's gonna happen with her?

35:50.896 --> 35:54.509
She'll disappear. I'll
make sure she does.

35:54.544 --> 35:57.311
So we'll... we'll never know?

35:57.346 --> 36:00.079
It needs to unfurl on its own,

36:00.114 --> 36:01.914
Anonymously,

36:01.949 --> 36:04.982
Where the world can't interfere.

36:05.979 --> 36:08.223
And if she's carrying what we think,

36:08.258 --> 36:10.318
You will know.

36:10.353 --> 36:12.379
We all will.

36:17.782 --> 36:19.484
Come on. Let's go.

36:21.106 --> 36:24.346
Letting the scoop of
your life walk away, hank.

36:25.801 --> 36:27.546
Nobody'd believe it anyway.

36:27.581 --> 36:29.506
Come on.

36:29.541 --> 36:32.408
I don't believe it.

36:42.338 --> 36:44.090
Yes, ed.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.328
I'll come up and see you guys tomorrow.

36:46.363 --> 36:47.782
Me, too.

36:53.849 --> 36:57.276
This... is 1948 dallanach.

36:57.311 --> 37:00.669
It was acquired in loch ness.

37:00.704 --> 37:03.945
I was up there looking
for a very rare creature.

37:03.980 --> 37:07.187
All I found was a very
rare bottle of scotch.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.928
I told myself that I would drink it

37:10.963 --> 37:13.837
If I ever found proof that...

37:15.664 --> 37:17.950
Pour a fourth, if you don't mind.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.444
Of course.

37:22.396 --> 37:24.106
I wanted to thank you.

37:24.141 --> 37:27.258
I got something back
that I wouldn't have

37:27.293 --> 37:29.044
If it hadn't been for you.

37:29.079 --> 37:32.003
So, you and theo...

37:32.038 --> 37:36.490
Well, let's just say we're hopeful.

37:36.525 --> 37:40.513
Well, I couldn't think
of a better thing to be.

37:41.595 --> 37:42.965
Here's to being hopeful.

37:48.533 --> 37:51.527
Something tells me I'll see you again.

37:53.064 --> 37:54.809
I hope so.

37:57.303 --> 37:59.089
Bye. Bye.

38:00.835 --> 38:02.578
Hey.

38:07.316 --> 38:10.024
I remember our premiere issue.

38:10.059 --> 38:13.134
Ah, my first letter from the editor.

38:13.169 --> 38:15.009
Started with a quote...

38:15.044 --> 38:17.829
"There are more things
in heaven and earth

38:17.864 --> 38:20.614
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

38:20.649 --> 38:21.825
"Hamlet."

38:21.860 --> 38:23.737
You know, it actually used to bug me-

38:23.772 --> 38:26.640
People always quoted that
to defend the possibility

38:26.675 --> 38:30.296
That there might be... U.F.O.S

38:30.331 --> 38:34.125
And bigfoots and...

38:34.160 --> 38:36.612
It's so much easier to disprove

38:36.647 --> 38:39.064
Than it is to believe, right?

38:40.933 --> 38:43.177
And then one day you see something

38:43.212 --> 38:46.384
And you're not so sure.

38:46.419 --> 38:48.434
Well, you could always change the name

38:48.469 --> 38:50.449
Of the magazine to "modern believer."

38:50.484 --> 38:52.451
Not yet.

38:52.486 --> 38:55.726
But... in the spirit of journalism,

38:55.761 --> 38:58.967
I think we should revisit everything.

38:59.002 --> 39:01.675
Everything that we've disproved.

39:01.710 --> 39:05.740
Yeah, from... area
51, bermuda triangle...

39:05.775 --> 39:07.527
I mean, you name it.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.488
'Cause maybe...

39:09.523 --> 39:11.357
We missed something.

39:11.392 --> 39:14.384
You want to revisit everything?

39:15.299 --> 39:17.209
Everything.

39:42.515 --> 39:44.697
They've come again-

39:44.732 --> 39:46.879
The blind, the sick-

39:46.914 --> 39:48.849
To be healed.

39:48.884 --> 39:50.750
It's okay.

39:50.785 --> 39:53.362
No need to turn anyone away.

39:53.397 --> 39:55.315
I'll see each of them.

40:10.191 --> 40:14.516
We've found her, haven't we?

40:14.551 --> 40:18.841
The one that can fix us both?
