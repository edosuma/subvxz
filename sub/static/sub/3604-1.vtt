must feel to know such power,

24:23.212 --> 24:24.918
to feel so special.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.183
It worked.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.555
What have you done?
What my father never could.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.012
l've isolated
the genetic building block
of these abilities.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.516
I've found its source.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.519
l have to get
to the loft, to my lab.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.568
There's a centrifuge there.
I have to verify and
duplicate these results.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.111
This is incredible.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.063
I don't understand.
What have you found?

24:52.158 --> 24:56.151
The contents of this
single syringe could
give powers to anyone.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.031
Give powers?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.787
And with the added
component of adrenaline,

25:00.875 --> 25:02.911
the effects would
be instantaneous.

25:38.579 --> 25:43.289

I admit. But I don't want
to fight you, Claire.

what you have.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.414
You see,
I lost everything
that made me special.

25:55.221 --> 25:59.214
Lost, but now found.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.345
There's a whole shopping list
of abilities right here.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.230
But I'm gonna start
with the best.

26:09.944 --> 26:12.105

26:55.823 --> 26:56.983

26:58.534 --> 27:00.741
I'm looking
for answers, too.

27:03.039 --> 27:06.372
Why don't I feel anything?
No nerve endings.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.583
An amazing bit
of machinery, this.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.793
And how much of it
do we actually use?
10%? Maybe 20?

27:16.552 --> 27:19.464

29:32.396 --> 29:33.727

29:35.024 --> 29:37.766
There's so much about yourself
you don't even understand.

Your brain is not

You are not like the others.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.025
You're different.

29:44.909 --> 29:48.743
You're special.
And I couldn't kill you
even if I wanted to.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.030
You can never die.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.710
And now I guess
neither can I.

30:16.107 --> 30:19.895
I ran two samples
in the centrifuge.
The enzymes held both times.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.193
You need to destroy
that, Dr. Suresh.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.406

talking about?

30:25.950 --> 30:29.488
It's like you said.
It's against
the laws of nature.

30:29.578 --> 30:33.446
No. Maya, this is a discovery
of world-changing proportions.

30:33.541 --> 30:37.534
The possibilities for
the advancement of science,
for our entire species...

30:37.628 --> 30:40.165
Ordinary people...
Would have my ability.

30:40.256 --> 30:44.340
No, no. Each individual's
blood chemistry is unique,
like fingerprints.

30:44.427 --> 30:47.385
These abilities could
manifest in an infinite
number of ways.

30:47.471 --> 30:51.009
But they can still
end up terrible,
like mine.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.809
Or they could be wonderful.
Flight, telepathy,
super strength.

30:54.895 --> 30:55.884
Of course, it would
have to be perfected.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.221
There'll be research
and development,
clinical trials.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.941
But in the wrong hands...
It's in the wrong
hands now, Maya.

31:02.028 --> 31:06.067
An entire clandestine company
dedicated to hiding it
from the rest of the world.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.864
Yes, because
of people like me!

31:09.493 --> 31:10.482
People like Sylar!

31:10.578 --> 31:13.445
Exactly. Sylar
killed my father.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.201
lfl had had
a legitimate chance to
inject myself with this,

31:16.292 --> 31:17.953
to give myself a power,

31:18.461 --> 31:20.372
then perhaps
I could've stopped that.

31:20.463 --> 31:21.794
That's my point.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.463
You would actually
inject yourself with that?

31:28.345 --> 31:32.133
There are quantum leaps
in science that one
dreams of being a part of.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.726
This is one of them.
I don't see why
you don't understand that.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.847
And I don't see
why anyone would want
these abilities. It's a curse!

31:46.489 --> 31:49.151
Can what's in that syringe
cure me or not?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.281
Then it's evil,

31:55.372 --> 31:59.581
and you should destroy it,
for the sake of all of us.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.265
Am I still here?
Yeah.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.436
"Touched by God."
That's what you
said in the chapel.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.867
I thought I dreamed that.

32:37.748 --> 32:41.536
It's true, Pete.
He saved me.
He came for me.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.544
He brought me back.

32:46.632 --> 32:51.217
We've seen
what people like us
can do, Nathan.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.841
Things no one
in the world can.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.388
I came back
from the dead.

32:57.059 --> 32:59.721
You had third-degree burns
over half your body.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.513
And who's to say
this isn't the hand of God?

33:06.235 --> 33:08.396
All of us
with these powers.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.481
Didn't you ever stop
and think about it, Pete?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.576
We can be angels,

33:19.165 --> 33:21.281
all here to do
God's bidding.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.081
What happened to
telling the world
aboutus?

33:31.802 --> 33:37.172
Well, we couldn't be
angels if everyone knew,
now, could we?

33:52.823 --> 33:56.065
I don't expect
you to understand
what I did to you.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.778
But I hope someday
you'll forgive me.

34:10.507 --> 34:13.044

isn't it, Nathan?

who healed me.

that shapes our ends,

for great things, Nathan.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.651

34:37.243 --> 34:39.609

of divine intervention

34:42.831 --> 34:45.573
