00:00.079 --> 00:02.444
What are you doing
in Mali, Nathan?

00:02.464 --> 00:04.030
<i>You went down there to get</i>

00:04.050 --> 00:05.439
the troop deal signed.

00:05.459 --> 00:08.471
<i>Troop deal has not
been signed, therefore</i>

00:08.491 --> 00:10.352
<i>I'm assuming
there is a problem.</i>

00:16.149 --> 00:18.568
Harry and Leyla recruited me
to translate for them.

00:21.275 --> 00:23.304
He says you have come to steal
from under our feet.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.140
And they were leading
the mission?

00:25.160 --> 00:28.210
- No, it was some guy called Miller.
- Nathan

00:28.230 --> 00:29.980
<i>Miller?</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:31.200
Why would you tell the parents
of a guy that died

00:31.220 --> 00:33.160
that his death achieved nothing,
if he actually helped

00:33.180 --> 00:36.150
<i>four colleagues escape?</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:39.060
- No!
- Maybe they never escaped.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.100
I know people who can get us
out of here, George.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.150
But if they do,
nobody can ever know about it.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.110
From the president's lips.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.050
He's signing the deal tomorrow.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.190
- We found these.
- Of course. Why wouldn't

00:50.210 --> 00:53.020
they bug
the anti-corruption minister?

00:53.040 --> 00:55.980
Were you in on it
with Miller and Jones all along?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.020
Amanda Jones?

00:58.040 --> 01:01.180
- <i>She's here.</i>
- <i>Harry?</i>

01:09.130 --> 01:12.030
Harry, what are you doing?

01:12.050 --> 01:15.020
- Harry, you need to let this go!
- What?

01:15.040 --> 01:16.100
Aicha's safe.
It's over.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.990
No.
No, not for me.

01:19.010 --> 01:20.990
Why, because Amanda Jones
is here, suddenly you do a 180?

01:21.010 --> 01:23.220
These are the same people
that fucked us last time,

01:24.010 --> 01:26.170
that tried to have us killed.
That doesn't bother you?

01:26.190 --> 01:29.000
No. You know why?

01:29.020 --> 01:31.160
Because it's in the past.
It's done.

01:31.180 --> 01:35.030
No. No, it's not.
I didn't do a deal with anyone.

01:35.050 --> 01:36.210
And there it is.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.040
This is about Max.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.080
You're going to get us killed
because you want to prove

01:41.100 --> 01:42.200
that you're not
your father's son.

01:42.220 --> 01:44.080
You know what, you know what,
fuck you, Leyla.

01:44.100 --> 01:47.040
You fucking ghosted me.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.130
And then you gate-crashed
my life and asked for my help.

01:50.150 --> 01:53.030
But now I'm the one
that's got to let it go.

01:55.030 --> 01:57.070
This is not just about Max,
it's about everything,

01:57.090 --> 02:00.030
and you're just as big a part
of it as he is.

02:02.030 --> 02:04.000
You said I crawled under a rock.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.170
I did.

02:05.190 --> 02:07.200
Well, I refuse
to live like that.

03:45.210 --> 03:46.210
Thank you.

03:46.230 --> 03:49.120
- Come to make sure I leave?
- Clarke and Toumi

03:49.140 --> 03:51.990
- didn't board their flight.
- Where are they?

03:52.010 --> 03:53.140
Outside Sissoko's house.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.180
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.190
- For fuck's sake!
- Harry, just leave it.

04:02.210 --> 04:05.020
What the hell
are you two doing here?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.190
Amanda Jones is in Bamako.

04:07.210 --> 04:09.010
I don't know what game
you are playing,

04:09.030 --> 04:10.220
but you need to leave.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.050
Is she working
on the troop deal with Miller?

04:16.110 --> 04:19.079
Amanda Jones
does not work for the CIA.

04:29.230 --> 04:32.170
You've got five minutes.

04:32.190 --> 04:35.040
Jones works <i>at</i> the CIA,

04:35.060 --> 04:37.200
- but she does not work for them.
- I don't follow.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.040
She works for a multinational

04:40.060 --> 04:41.110
<i>called KMPH.</i>

04:41.130 --> 04:43.040
<i>Government contractors</i>

04:43.060 --> 04:45.160
<i>who make a killing
out of conflict zones.</i>

04:45.180 --> 04:48.070
If Jones is involved
in the troop deal,

04:48.090 --> 04:51.040
it's KMPH who are behind it,
not the U.S. government.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.210
Wait-wait a second.

04:52.230 --> 04:55.110
How do they know about KMPH?

05:00.150 --> 05:02.080
Did you know?

05:05.060 --> 05:07.130
You didn't think to tell me?

05:07.150 --> 05:11.220
You didn't think that this was
pertinent information, Amanda?

05:15.220 --> 05:17.190
I asked you a question.

05:21.110 --> 05:23.210
There's something
you need to see.

05:30.110 --> 05:33.140
What is this?
What am I looking at?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.990
<i>My name is Martin Collins.</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:46.020
<i>I'm an attorney</i>

05:46.040 --> 05:48.020
<i>at Greenburg,
Morgan and Squire.</i>

05:48.040 --> 05:51.010
<i>My client... my only client...</i>

05:51.030 --> 05:52.210
<i>is William Kingsley</i>

05:52.230 --> 05:54.150
<i>of Kingsley Merchant
Proctor Hall,</i>

05:54.170 --> 05:57.140
<i>an engineering
and construction company</i>

05:57.160 --> 06:01.120
<i>with subsidiaries in defense
and private security.</i>

06:02.190 --> 06:05.130
<i>They made $40 billion</i>

06:05.150 --> 06:07.060
<i>from the Iraq War.</i>

06:07.080 --> 06:09.100
<i>After that,
they set about trying to insure</i>

06:09.120 --> 06:11.980
<i>those kinds of returns.</i>

06:12.000 --> 06:14.050
<i>To that end,</i>

06:14.070 --> 06:16.110
<i>they infiltrated
the intelligence services</i>

06:16.130 --> 06:18.030
<i>to act on their behalf.</i>

06:18.050 --> 06:20.190
<i>Their key contact
is Amanda Jones,</i>

06:20.210 --> 06:22.120
<i>a senior supervisor</i>

06:22.140 --> 06:25.150
<i>at the Central
Intelligence Agency.</i>

06:41.210 --> 06:43.230
There's something else.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.140
I made a deal with Max Easton.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.030
Harry Clarke's father.

06:51.050 --> 06:53.070
Of course you did.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.030
You keep his family safe,

06:56.050 --> 06:58.190
and he doesn't...

06:58.210 --> 07:00.200
release this tape.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.040
Pretty much.

07:02.060 --> 07:04.080
Yeah, we talked

07:04.100 --> 07:07.130
about releasing
Clarke and Toumi.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.130
We were in this room.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.190
And I said that they had
no skin in the game.

07:18.010 --> 07:20.000
That's what I said.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.170
Those were my exact...

07:22.190 --> 07:24.150
words.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.990
And you sat there...

07:27.010 --> 07:29.110
and you said fucking nothing!

07:31.140 --> 07:32.990
I didn't think
they would come back.

07:33.010 --> 07:34.050
No, you <i>hoped</i>

07:34.070 --> 07:36.160
that they wouldn't come back.

07:36.180 --> 07:40.130
That's not the same
fucking thing, Amanda.

07:40.150 --> 07:43.230
We're supposed to be
on the same fucking side.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.090
How are we supposed to deal
with them now?

07:48.110 --> 07:52.080
They're gonna
fuck this whole thing up.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.080
What are you gonna do?

08:07.110 --> 08:09.140
I'm gonna go back to D.C.

08:11.070 --> 08:14.040
And I'm gonna
take this to Kingsley...

08:16.000 --> 08:18.010
and see if he can't figure out

08:18.030 --> 08:20.000
what to do about this tape.

08:20.020 --> 08:22.170
Kingsley knows.

08:22.190 --> 08:25.220
About the tape.
Kingsley knows.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.010
Of course he does.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.210
Un-fucking-believable.

08:32.230 --> 08:35.020
Is there anything else
you want to tell me,

08:35.039 --> 08:37.030
Amanda Jones?

08:43.159 --> 08:46.150
I need to know
what's gonna happen.

08:46.170 --> 08:48.140
Nathan, my name is on there.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.010
I don't know
what's gonna happen...

08:54.030 --> 08:56.210
Amanda.

08:56.230 --> 09:00.090
But I can't imagine that it's
gonna end very well for you.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.070
Pick 'em up.

09:07.090 --> 09:09.000
I don't care
what you got to do...

09:09.020 --> 09:11.030
issue a warrant...
just pick 'em up.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.110
And I don't want you
to do anything with them

09:13.130 --> 09:15.220
until you hear from me,
do you understand?

09:26.090 --> 09:28.080
<i>They funnel arms</i>

09:28.100 --> 09:30.130
to Al Moctar,
destabilize the region,

09:30.150 --> 09:33.150
create a problem
for American troops to clean up.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.120
That's where they make
their money.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.070
Look, you take this
to President Diabate,

09:37.090 --> 09:38.980
this changes everything.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.070
The president
is no longer taking my calls.

09:41.090 --> 09:43.180
Besides, you have
a conspiracy theory.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.080
- No more.
- Fine, so we-so we find a link

09:46.100 --> 09:49.040
- between KMPH and Al Moctar.
- Just like that?

09:49.060 --> 09:51.070
Did Miller ever come back to the camp?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.110
- No.
- Okay. What about the weapons...

09:53.130 --> 09:56.040
- did you see who supplied them?
- No.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.070
I translated the deal,
but they kept me blindfolded.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.140
<i>Merci.</i>

09:59.160 --> 10:02.170
There are American soldiers
at the gates.

10:02.190 --> 10:04.140
They have a warrant
for your arrest for the attack

10:04.160 --> 10:06.110
on the bar.
They want all of you.

10:06.130 --> 10:09.030
- Sorry, for what? - This just gets better.
- I-I have a car

10:09.050 --> 10:11.040
in the garage.
You can leave out the back.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.010
Okay. Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.110
Aicha.

10:14.130 --> 10:15.130
Aicha, where are you going?
This way.

10:15.150 --> 10:17.010
Seydou and Sonata.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.170
Aicha, I'm sorry,
we can't take them with us.

10:18.190 --> 10:21.030
We have to go.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.090
- Where?
- Put on your shoes.

10:23.110 --> 10:25.040
Come on. Wake up, bubba.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.060
Aicha, we can't take them.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.180
They will be safe here.
I promise.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.220
They're coming
through the gates. Come on!

10:34.110 --> 10:36.210
Aicha, we need to go.

10:36.230 --> 10:40.020
I need you to be strong, okay?

10:56.190 --> 10:59.020
Good luck.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.210
Go, go, go!

11:06.210 --> 11:09.190
They're heading east
in a black station wagon.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.220
Bollocks.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.990
Move!

12:18.010 --> 12:20.050
- Move! Out! Out!
- Come on, move!

12:20.070 --> 12:21.200
Hey. Hey.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.000
We're losing them!

12:35.020 --> 12:37.030
What are we going to do,
mow down a bunch of kids?

13:52.020 --> 13:54.020
Adam McKay.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.050
Rodgers International.
We're here to get you

13:56.070 --> 13:58.140
- to Bamako safely.
- Nathan Miller.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.060
That's George White.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.140
Leyla Toumi,
that's Harry Clarke.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.210
This everyone? I was briefed
you had a five-man team.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.060
We lost one.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.140
Right. Well, we'll need
to move quickly.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.060
You're still
a walking price tag.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.010
George, we can go back for her.

14:16.030 --> 14:17.980
- Sorry, what's that?
- There's a local translator

14:18.000 --> 14:20.030
we were working with.
She was left behind.

14:20.050 --> 14:22.060
Yeah, but with
this extra manpower...

14:22.080 --> 14:24.060
- I'm sorry, you want to go back?
- There's no reason

14:24.080 --> 14:27.020
- why we can't do this.
- I'm not risking my men for a local raghead.

14:28.090 --> 14:30.980
What the fuck did you just say?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.980
You fucking heard
what I said to you.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.060
- Fuck you! Fuck you.
- Everybody just calm down, okay?

14:35.080 --> 14:37.180
Catch a fucking clue.
She is irrelevant.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.020
- Leyla.
- Put a fucking leash on this one.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.180
- Please?
- Leyla.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
We don't have a choice.
Let's just go.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.980
Go.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.010
Right, so we'll
spend the night here.

15:17.030 --> 15:19.010
Flight out in the morning.

15:25.130 --> 15:29.080
Come on in, then.
Make yourself at home.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.120
Plenty of beer in the fridge.

15:41.050 --> 15:44.000
Look, I know things

15:44.020 --> 15:46.030
didn't go as planned out there.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.050
I know how you're feeling.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.180
- I'm feeling it, too.
- Are you?

15:55.140 --> 15:58.110
What, you think
that was easy for me?

15:58.130 --> 16:01.070
Come on, Leyla,
I had to make a choice.

16:02.230 --> 16:04.130
And I chose to get us home.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.100
Now, the ransom...

16:12.140 --> 16:14.170
...was aid money,

16:14.190 --> 16:17.060
diverted from
its intended destination.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.170
That can never, <i>ever</i>

16:20.190 --> 16:22.160
leave this room.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.040
And when we debrief, we escaped.

16:28.060 --> 16:29.990
And during the course
of that escape,

16:30.010 --> 16:34.040
Isaac Turner
was tragically shot.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.080
Are we clear?

16:41.150 --> 16:44.000
Harry?

16:45.020 --> 16:47.140
Mm-hmm. Clear.

16:55.090 --> 16:59.040
Leyla, are we clear?

17:03.080 --> 17:05.089
Yes.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.140
Thank you.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.060
How you holding up?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.160
He came to me as an intern.

19:02.060 --> 19:04.140
Isaac... he...

19:04.160 --> 19:06.170
he wanted to change the world.

19:10.030 --> 19:12.170
He was so enthusiastic.

19:16.100 --> 19:20.010
I cannot remember the last time
I felt enthusiasm like that.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.190
And maybe that's why
I was so fond of him.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.220
He reminded me
of what I've lost.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.060
To Isaac.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.150
Um...

19:44.170 --> 19:47.100
this is gonna seem
a little insensitive...

19:47.120 --> 19:50.110
The job goes on.
I get it.

19:50.130 --> 19:54.100
What was your take on Al Moctar?

19:56.150 --> 19:58.170
He's dedicated.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.210
And he's smart.

20:00.230 --> 20:04.070
And he commands loyalty, but...

20:04.090 --> 20:08.020
he has no common cause
with Ansar Dine or al-Qaeda.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.990
He's not interested
in an Islamic state.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.100
Think of what he could do
with the right kind of backing.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.000
Take the fight
to the insurgents.

20:17.020 --> 20:19.190
Disrupt them, at the very least.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.000
Our enemy's enemy.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.020
Even if he did put a bullet
in the back of Isaac's head.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.190
Yeah, it's hard to take, I know.

20:27.210 --> 20:30.010
Yeah, I know.
I get how the world works, Nate.

20:30.030 --> 20:32.070
We've been in bed with worse.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.990
Do you know anyone here

20:35.010 --> 20:37.220
that could help us
get him some hardware?

20:41.220 --> 20:45.080
There's somebody
I could introduce you to, yeah.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.130
Thank you.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.000
Yes?

20:55.060 --> 20:56.140
Hey.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.100
What, are you checking up on me?

20:59.130 --> 21:02.050
Yeah, I am.

21:04.050 --> 21:06.080
I'd kill for a good read.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.120
No, I can't help you with that.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.180
What can you help me with?

21:14.130 --> 21:17.130
- Sorry. I... That was just really...
- No, I get it.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.020
I get it.

21:28.130 --> 21:32.080
I've been through
some fucked-up shit.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.220
I usually put it in a box...

21:36.100 --> 21:37.230
...seal it up, move on.

21:42.150 --> 21:44.210
That's how I deal with it.

21:44.230 --> 21:48.020
And now I can't stop
thinking about her.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.100
Aicha.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.980
We should never have
gotten her involved.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.150
No, we weren't to know.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.220
That may be.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.020
But this is on us.

22:12.180 --> 22:15.060
I'll, um...

22:15.080 --> 22:16.130
I'll let you get some rest.

22:16.150 --> 22:19.090
Yeah.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.030
Stay.

22:37.010 --> 22:39.230
I can't really
be around anyone else.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.010
And I don't
want to be on my own.

23:20.130 --> 23:22.070
George.

23:22.090 --> 23:24.090
- Dan.
- Been too long, my friend.

23:24.110 --> 23:26.200
Yes, it has.
Uh, this is the gentleman

23:26.220 --> 23:28.160
I was telling you about,
Nathan Miller.

23:28.180 --> 23:30.170
- Mr. Lotz.
- If we're talking business,

23:30.190 --> 23:33.190
it's Dan.
Please come in.

23:33.210 --> 23:37.210
I've just opened up
a rather robust Malbec.

24:03.190 --> 24:05.010
Good morning.

24:12.050 --> 24:15.080
- Morning.
- I should probably...

24:16.100 --> 24:18.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.210
All right, well, I'll,

24:39.230 --> 24:43.000
um... see you out there.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.100
Yeah.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.170
Morning, Adam.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.020
Oh, you lucky devil.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.170
How the hell did you swing that?

25:13.190 --> 25:15.100
You don't say much, do you?

25:15.120 --> 25:17.020
What are you,
the soul of discretion?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.990
Well, you can obviously close
a deal. Actually, I could use

25:20.010 --> 25:23.130
a guy like you,
if you ever tire of the game.

25:23.150 --> 25:26.990
Not a bad life.
Tax man doesn't see a penny.

25:27.010 --> 25:30.170
Yeah, thanks, um...
it's not really my thing.

25:30.190 --> 25:33.210
Right. Yeah.

25:33.230 --> 25:36.000
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

25:36.020 --> 25:37.160
you know where to find me.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.010
Seydou.

26:01.030 --> 26:03.010
- Aicha.
- Aicha!

26:05.080 --> 26:09.040
Aicha! Aicha! Aicha!

27:12.230 --> 27:15.080
I hear you have money to spend.

27:22.020 --> 27:25.080
The air force.
That is my problem.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.050
I can help you with that.

27:30.070 --> 27:33.180
Light to carry, easy to operate, FIM-92.

27:33.200 --> 27:37.000
Shoulder-firing
by a single operator,

27:37.020 --> 27:38.130
average flying speed:

27:38.150 --> 27:41.120
1,600 miles an hour.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.210
Targeting range:

27:43.230 --> 27:47.050
up to 15,700 feet.

27:47.070 --> 27:49.130
Now, one of these puppies
will set you back

27:49.150 --> 27:52.100
100,000 U.S. dollars.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.020
Naturally, if you're
considering bulk buying,

27:55.040 --> 27:56.140
we can discuss a discount.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.150
Okay, this is me.

28:14.170 --> 28:18.140
Commercial to D.C.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.010
Thank you.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.030
All of you.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.030
George.

28:27.050 --> 28:29.210
- We'll talk soon, huh?
- We will. Safe travels.

28:37.010 --> 28:39.140
Take some time off.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.150
It's the least you deserve.

28:43.050 --> 28:45.060
Thank you, sir.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.000
Both of you.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.180
Got one piece of advice:

28:50.200 --> 28:53.070
don't wallow.

28:53.090 --> 28:55.030
Nope.

28:59.090 --> 29:01.220
What are you gonna do?

29:03.170 --> 29:05.020
Don't know.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.200
Drink.

29:08.130 --> 29:11.040
Well, maybe we could, uh...

29:12.060 --> 29:13.210
Probably not a good idea.

29:13.230 --> 29:16.040
Probably not.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.130
We have to work together,
you know?

29:19.150 --> 29:22.090
Right.
No, you are right.

29:27.010 --> 29:28.190
See you on the next one.

29:28.210 --> 29:30.040
Yeah.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.090
Yeah, see you.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.070
William.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.160
You look like shit.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.130
Just came straight
from the airport.

29:53.150 --> 29:55.060
Which explains the monkey.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.080
Ah, Dulles Airport...

29:57.100 --> 29:59.000
Best mall in America.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.130
It's for Katie.

30:00.150 --> 30:03.090
I didn't think
it was for your wife.

30:03.110 --> 30:05.090
Thank you, Nathan.
I don't say that

30:05.110 --> 30:07.170
as often as I should.

30:07.190 --> 30:11.170
I can only imagine
what you've been through.

30:11.190 --> 30:14.050
Well, it's all part
of the service, right?

30:14.070 --> 30:16.170
Still, it is nice
to be appreciated.

30:16.190 --> 30:19.200
Thank you, William,

30:19.220 --> 30:21.110
for stepping up.

30:21.130 --> 30:24.980
I know that
that was a big chunk of change.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.040
Think of it as an investment.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.000
Hmm.

30:30.020 --> 30:32.160
You think this George White...

30:32.180 --> 30:35.100
you think
he might come in useful?

30:35.120 --> 30:37.050
Oh, we'll keep working on him.

30:37.070 --> 30:39.060
And Al Moctar... is he our guy?

30:39.080 --> 30:41.090
I got to tell you,

30:41.110 --> 30:45.010
I think he is exactly
what we're looking for.

30:45.030 --> 30:46.210
Support in place?

30:46.230 --> 30:49.060
White introduces me
to this guy, Dan Lotz.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.100
Seriously connected.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.140
Five minutes
into the conversation,

30:53.160 --> 30:57.100
he name-drops Joseph Damba,
the minister of transportation.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.020
- That's a convenient double act.
- Yeah, yeah.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.150
So, between the two of them,

31:02.170 --> 31:04.120
getting the hardware
into the country and getting it

31:04.140 --> 31:05.980
to Al Moctar
shouldn't be a problem.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.180
Well, I'd say you've turned
defeat into victory.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.060
By the hair
on my chinny-chin-chin.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.060
Thank you.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.110
Katie bird!

31:35.130 --> 31:37.110
Daddy!

31:37.130 --> 31:39.140
- Daddy.
- Ah, ha!

31:39.160 --> 31:42.110
Oh, it's so good to see you.

31:42.130 --> 31:44.990
Oh, I missed you so much.

31:45.010 --> 31:46.110
- I missed you, too.
- Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.140
Hey, oh. Ow.
Wait a second.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.030
There's something wrong
with my shoulder.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.980
- Would you just see...?
- Ooh.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.190
Thank you so much. I love her.

31:54.210 --> 31:57.140
- You're welcome. I love you.
- Hey, you. You didn't call.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.200
Ah. I wanted to surprise you.

31:59.220 --> 32:01.190
Well, we had no idea
you were coming.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.090
Uh, well, you know, I didn't,
either, until the last minute.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.990
How was your trip?

32:06.010 --> 32:08.000
The usual.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.210
You look exhausted.

32:10.230 --> 32:12.170
- Coffee's on.
- Yeah, I'd love one.

32:12.190 --> 32:15.100
- I'll pour it for you.
- Perfect. Thank you.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.000
Been drinking?

32:20.020 --> 32:22.200
I had one
with William at breakfast.

32:22.220 --> 32:24.160
So you didn't come
straight home, then?

32:24.180 --> 32:26.040
Here's your coffee, Daddy.

32:26.060 --> 32:28.030
Ah.
Okay, let me see.

32:28.050 --> 32:30.080
Is this still the best
cup of coffee in America?

32:30.100 --> 32:31.990
Should be.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.030
Well, let's see. Mmm.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.130
Mmm.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.150
Yes, it is.

32:37.170 --> 32:40.200
Hey, I have an idea.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.210
What?

32:42.230 --> 32:46.090
What if we were
to all go eat at Jack's tonight?

32:46.110 --> 32:48.010
I have a fund-raiser tonight.

32:48.030 --> 32:49.090
Abbie's secured a couple
of new investors.

32:49.110 --> 32:52.010
They're expecting
a full charm offensive. I...

32:52.030 --> 32:54.080
Well, you are
the most charming person I know.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.120
- Right.
- Congratulations.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.070
How about you, huh? Huh?

32:58.090 --> 32:59.140
You want to go
on a date with me?

32:59.160 --> 33:02.010
Well, I'd love to, but

33:02.030 --> 33:04.000
I have sleepover
at Emily's tonight.

33:04.020 --> 33:06.080
We didn't know
you were coming home, Nate.

33:06.100 --> 33:09.050
- I could cancel.
- No. No, no, no, no.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.050
I know that's important to you.
It's okay.

33:11.070 --> 33:13.020
- Okay.
- We'll do it another time, huh?

33:13.040 --> 33:14.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.090
You should drink your coffee,
you know.

33:17.110 --> 33:19.090
Okay, I'll drink my coffee.

33:19.110 --> 33:22.090
Mom, what time
are you taking me to Em's?

33:22.110 --> 33:26.130
Well, we can go quite soon
if you want to. You ready to go?

33:31.030 --> 33:33.020
<i>So,</i>

33:33.040 --> 33:34.180
how was your trip?

33:34.200 --> 33:38.060
It's London.
Grey, inhospitable.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.180
You want a coffee?

33:39.200 --> 33:41.150
- Three shots.
- What?

33:41.170 --> 33:43.170
What?
So I'm an addict.

33:43.190 --> 33:46.200
Espresso, please.
Three shots.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.060
You figured out
who paid Miller's ransom?

33:51.080 --> 33:54.150
Not yet, but Elliot told me

33:54.170 --> 33:57.010
it wasn't Al Moctar's
first hostage scenario,

33:57.030 --> 34:01.010
which means there must be
money trails, account transfers.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.990
Thank you.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.130
- Remember Jacob Hirsch?
- Yeah.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.199
Didn't he move over

34:09.219 --> 34:12.190
to the Terrorist Finance
Tracking Program?

34:12.210 --> 34:15.179
I think so.
You want me to set up a meet?

34:15.199 --> 34:17.210
Yeah. Don't have him
come by the office.

34:17.230 --> 34:20.070
Let's do this one at home.

34:20.090 --> 34:22.000
<i>Still looking.</i>

34:22.020 --> 34:23.139
Well, I was-I was hoping...

34:23.159 --> 34:26.159
Excuse me. I was hoping
that you had better news for me.

34:26.179 --> 34:28.030
<i>Well, we know
they're heading north.</i>

34:28.050 --> 34:29.190
Have you spoken to Kingsley yet?

34:29.210 --> 34:32.000
<i>Look, the only thing
you need to be concerned with</i>

34:32.020 --> 34:34.080
is finding Clarke and Toumi.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.150
<i>Today the first U.S.
troops arrived in Bamako</i>

34:40.170 --> 34:43.110
<i>under the recently-signed
aid and assist deal.</i>

34:43.130 --> 34:45.100
She'll be with you
in a moment.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.040
Jacob.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.010
Senator.

34:49.030 --> 34:51.080
Thank you so much
for doing this.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.179
Not a problem.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.030
- Coffee?
- Uh, yeah, thank you.

34:56.210 --> 34:58.210
So, your guy, Al Moctar...

34:58.230 --> 35:01.000
been on our radar since 2012.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.160
Linked to terrorist funding?

35:02.180 --> 35:04.160
Not directly.

35:04.180 --> 35:07.210
He was a sporadic participant
in the kidnap-and-ransom game.

35:07.230 --> 35:12.000
That whole region...
northern Mali, east into Niger...

35:12.020 --> 35:14.130
it's like a Disneyland
of corporate abduction.

35:14.150 --> 35:18.110
Private company insurance has
paid out hundreds of millions,

35:18.130 --> 35:19.190
and people have no clue.

35:19.210 --> 35:21.120
You have anything on him?

35:21.140 --> 35:23.120
Oh, yes.

35:23.140 --> 35:26.080
Last known tracking linked
to Al Moctar

35:26.100 --> 35:29.140
gave us a whole bunch
of account numbers.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.060
Where are we with Clarke
and Toumi?

35:37.080 --> 35:38.200
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

35:38.220 --> 35:40.130
We will find them, Nate.

35:45.070 --> 35:47.160
Nate?

35:47.180 --> 35:49.050
I got to go.

35:49.070 --> 35:51.030
I'm pulling up
at Kingsley's now.

36:27.150 --> 36:30.080
Take over
here, would you, Bobby?

36:35.040 --> 36:37.190
You here for
the rib eye, Nathan?

36:37.210 --> 36:39.080
Mr. Weaver.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.060
I work very hard
to keep a clear distance

36:44.080 --> 36:47.060
between personal
and professional.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.010
If they have to be bridged,

36:50.030 --> 36:53.170
the least I expect
is the courtesy of a call.

36:53.190 --> 36:56.020
I'm afraid I couldn't
take that risk, sir.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.050
Then I assume we have
a serious problem.

37:00.070 --> 37:02.090
We do.

37:03.210 --> 37:07.180
You have Kingsley in place
for these situations.

37:09.020 --> 37:12.040
I'm afraid that
he is the problem, sir.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.040
<i>This is the long arm</i>

37:14.060 --> 37:17.070
<i>of KMPH and others like them.</i>

37:17.090 --> 37:19.990
<i>Governments come and go.</i>

37:20.010 --> 37:23.110
<i>These guys... are forever.</i>

37:23.130 --> 37:26.060
<i>They determine who to bomb,</i>

37:26.080 --> 37:27.190
<i>where to invade,</i>

37:27.210 --> 37:29.180
<i>they build the drones,
the Hellfire missiles</i>

37:29.200 --> 37:31.150
<i>that destroy the homes,
the factories.</i>

37:31.170 --> 37:33.110
<i>Then they get the contracts</i>

37:33.130 --> 37:37.080
<i>to rebuild those same homes,
those same factories.</i>

37:37.100 --> 37:39.050
<i>Cash from chaos.</i>

37:39.070 --> 37:40.210
<i>War on terror.</i>

37:42.110 --> 37:44.170
<i>War in perpetuity.</i>

37:45.180 --> 37:47.040
Jesus Christ.

37:47.060 --> 37:50.120
How the fuck did this happen?

37:50.140 --> 37:51.210
I don't know.

37:53.220 --> 37:57.190
Jones and Kingsley decided
to keep this one to themselves.

37:57.210 --> 38:00.040
You know what Kingsley told me?

38:00.060 --> 38:03.160
That we lost our senior contact
in the Iranian regime.

38:03.180 --> 38:07.010
That's why Tehran
was put on hold.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.210
- Yes, sir.
- And I believed him.

38:09.230 --> 38:13.030
Hell, I've trusted Kingsley
for 20 years.

38:13.050 --> 38:15.020
And he's delivered.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.140
Every step of the way.

38:19.230 --> 38:22.030
Clarke and Toumi are a threat

38:22.050 --> 38:24.080
to the operation in Mali, sir.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.040
So deal with them.

38:26.060 --> 38:28.090
If we do that,
there is a chance

38:28.110 --> 38:31.120
that Harry Clarke's father
will release this tape.

38:34.040 --> 38:38.060
What a fucking mess.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.210
We need to deal with this, sir.

38:39.230 --> 38:41.190
How?

38:45.190 --> 38:48.120
We let...

38:48.140 --> 38:50.130
Kingsley go.

38:50.150 --> 38:54.050
KMPH is no longer viable.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.150
It can't service
the operation in Mali.

38:56.170 --> 38:59.050
As a corporation...

38:59.070 --> 39:01.100
however this thing
plays itself out...

39:01.120 --> 39:04.020
it is now toxic.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.210
Now, how do you know

39:10.230 --> 39:13.110
I'm not gonna call up Kingsley
the moment you leave

39:13.130 --> 39:16.040
and tell him about
your little visit?

39:20.110 --> 39:21.140
I-I don't.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.980
There's a total
of 15 million here

39:27.000 --> 39:29.100
heading into what we think
is an Al Moctar account.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.140
33 payments of disparate amounts

39:31.160 --> 39:35.140
were sanctioned on or around the
date that Miller was released,

39:35.160 --> 39:39.150
processed and proceeded
through 19 shelter companies,

39:39.170 --> 39:41.180
and then hit this account,

39:41.200 --> 39:44.070
assuming it is Al Moctar's.

39:44.090 --> 39:48.170
But he did receive 50 million,
albeit from multiple sources?

39:48.190 --> 39:50.200
And that's not uncommon.

39:50.220 --> 39:55.020
Usually finds its way through
to arms dealers, through, uh,

39:55.040 --> 39:57.020
opaque sounding companies,

39:57.040 --> 39:59.100
import-export, licensing.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.060
But what's weird

40:01.080 --> 40:02.990
are the specifics in this case.

40:03.010 --> 40:05.030
How so?

40:05.050 --> 40:07.110
One of the first payments
originated

40:07.130 --> 40:10.050
from a company here,
in Virginia.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.180
What does it trade in?

40:12.200 --> 40:14.180
Death.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.030
Sure this is the right address?

40:23.050 --> 40:24.070
Yeah.

40:42.180 --> 40:44.070
We finally catch a break.

40:44.090 --> 40:47.080
The source of the ransom.
And it's this place?

40:47.100 --> 40:49.030
Doesn't add up.

40:51.070 --> 40:53.030
Let's go home.

40:57.140 --> 40:59.170
I'm back.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.200
Gina?

41:05.220 --> 41:09.190
Honey? I could
murder a glass of...

41:15.110 --> 41:17.230
What is it?

41:22.150 --> 41:23.150
Gina.

41:25.220 --> 41:27.120
I've been suspended.

41:27.140 --> 41:30.020
- What?
- Escorted off campus.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.130
It was... it was hu-humiliating.

41:32.150 --> 41:34.040
I don't understand.
Why?

41:34.060 --> 41:36.090
I've been accused of,

41:36.110 --> 41:39.090
uh, um...

41:39.110 --> 41:41.050
of harassment.

41:41.070 --> 41:43.170
One of-one of my students.

41:43.190 --> 41:46.180
They-they won't tell me who.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.000
It-it's bullshit.
You know that I-I wouldn't...

41:49.020 --> 41:51.030
Hey, I know. I know. I know.
Come here.

41:51.050 --> 41:54.030
Okay. Okay.

42:15.230 --> 42:18.980
We'll stop around here.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.050
Get something to eat.

42:52.060 --> 42:54.030
Yeah, it'll do.

42:58.210 --> 43:02.100
I'm gonna go and find us
some food. Okay?

43:11.030 --> 43:12.120
Where are we going?

43:12.140 --> 43:13.190
To find food.

43:13.210 --> 43:15.060
Yeah, after that.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.120
We keep driving.

43:21.140 --> 43:25.040
Cross the border. Mauritania,
Senegal, whichever's closest.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.980
And then what?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.030
You don't have a plan, do you?

43:30.050 --> 43:32.130
You brought us out here
on a fucking whim.

43:32.150 --> 43:35.040
A fucking whim
that kept us alive.

43:35.060 --> 43:37.000
You know, you could
help here, Leyla.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.140
To do what?

43:38.160 --> 43:41.130
To take on Amanda Jones?
To take on KMPH?

43:41.150 --> 43:43.070
Get the truth out there?
Will that do it?

43:43.090 --> 43:45.120
Will it be enough?

44:13.160 --> 44:15.190
Yeah.

44:18.190 --> 44:21.050
- Sir.
- Mm-hmm?

44:23.190 --> 44:27.110
The details.
For Isaac's parents.

44:27.130 --> 44:29.150
Thank you.

44:31.150 --> 44:33.090
I could arrange
for someone else to go.

44:33.110 --> 44:35.180
No, no.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.170
I'll handle it myself.

44:41.090 --> 44:43.180
<i>We're very grateful
for his patriotism,</i>

44:43.200 --> 44:45.990
<i>for his dedication
and his service,</i>

44:46.010 --> 44:48.200
and his sacrifice
for queen and country.

44:48.220 --> 44:51.190
Rest assured
he did not die in vain.

44:53.040 --> 44:56.140
My uncle died in the Falklands,
Mr. White.

44:56.160 --> 45:00.090
My dad's best friend
died in the first Iraq war.

45:01.200 --> 45:04.200
My best man
died in the second one.

45:06.110 --> 45:07.990
And for what?

45:08.010 --> 45:11.140
Nothing changes.

45:11.160 --> 45:15.060
I don't want your empty words.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.980
What I want to know is

45:18.000 --> 45:21.110
how did my son die?

45:21.130 --> 45:24.160
Because that's
the least you owe us.

45:27.140 --> 45:30.010
Isaac was executed.

45:32.160 --> 45:35.980
He was shot
in the back of the head

45:36.000 --> 45:38.220
after a failed escape attempt.

45:41.140 --> 45:43.170
Thank you.

46:00.020 --> 46:04.020
I've never found the answers
at the bottom of a glass.

46:06.090 --> 46:09.210
Well, that depends
on how hard you look.

46:12.140 --> 46:15.190
Please.
Join me in the search.

46:15.210 --> 46:18.040
Uh, can I get two more, please?

46:20.050 --> 46:22.000
How'd it go
with Turner's parents?

46:22.020 --> 46:24.990
It was...

46:25.010 --> 46:27.150
Actually, it was rough.

46:28.170 --> 46:30.170
Thank you.

46:33.090 --> 46:35.180
They don't appreciate
what we go through...

46:35.200 --> 46:38.120
our political masters.

46:41.070 --> 46:44.150
They don't deserve us.

46:44.170 --> 46:48.000
And they certainly
didn't deserve Isaac Turner.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.160
Most of the time
I don't think they give a shit.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.140
You've got that right.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.210
- Hey.
- <i>Nathan.</i>

47:03.230 --> 47:06.010
I just sat with George White.

47:06.030 --> 47:08.010
<i>And? Is he on board?</i>

47:08.030 --> 47:10.020
Let's just say he's in play.

47:11.190 --> 47:13.060
I've got another call.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.000
That is great, great,
great work, Amanda.

47:18.090 --> 47:20.150
Dan, how did it go?

47:20.170 --> 47:23.980
<i>Good. Very good.</i>

47:24.000 --> 47:25.110
<i>You made sure he got the 92s?</i>

47:25.130 --> 47:26.190
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:26.210 --> 47:29.010
Apparently, he couldn't
get enough of them.

47:29.030 --> 47:30.090
Like a kid on Christmas morning.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.990
Wow.

47:33.010 --> 47:34.050
Okay, here we go.

47:34.070 --> 47:35.090
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:35.110 --> 47:37.070
- All right, then.
- <i>Talk soon.</i>

47:55.010 --> 47:56.150
Hey.

47:56.170 --> 47:58.050
Wow. You look...

47:58.070 --> 47:59.120
beautiful.

47:59.140 --> 48:01.020
Thanks.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.140
Have you seen my keys?

48:02.160 --> 48:04.170
Oh, here they are.

48:06.090 --> 48:08.150
Uh, I'm running late.

48:08.170 --> 48:10.150
Don't wait up.

48:12.010 --> 48:13.130
I won't.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.980
What?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.060
Nothing.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.990
Don't do this, Nate.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.000
Not now.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.190
Do what?

48:25.210 --> 48:29.080
What am I doing?

48:29.100 --> 48:32.020
You always do this.
You always put it on me.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.150
Is that what I'm doing, Nicole?

48:33.170 --> 48:35.200
Yeah. You come home,
no warning,

48:35.220 --> 48:38.110
and you expect me
to just jump up and down

48:38.130 --> 48:40.040
- and throw my arms around you...
- A little affection

48:40.060 --> 48:41.050
would be nice.

48:41.070 --> 48:43.000
I had a pretty tough week.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.010
Well, I wouldn't know,
would I?

48:44.030 --> 48:46.080
I mean,
what do you want from me?

48:46.100 --> 48:47.080
I...

48:47.100 --> 48:48.120
You don't live here.

48:48.140 --> 48:50.080
What are you talking about?

48:50.100 --> 48:52.120
Yes, I do.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.140
- Oh.
- I sleep here.

48:54.160 --> 48:56.030
My-my clothes are here.

48:56.050 --> 48:57.160
My life is here.
You and Katie are here.

48:57.180 --> 48:59.120
This is a hotel for you.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.070
You check in, you check out.

49:01.090 --> 49:03.160
We're not supposed to know
where you go in between.

49:03.180 --> 49:05.000
We're supposed to just adapt.

49:05.020 --> 49:06.130
And, you know what,
that's killing us, Nate.

49:06.150 --> 49:08.150
But, hey,

49:08.170 --> 49:11.200
we've learned
to get along without you.

49:16.220 --> 49:19.190
Well, I had no idea
that this was how you felt.

49:19.210 --> 49:23.200
How could you not fucking know?

49:27.210 --> 49:30.040
I can't do this.

49:30.060 --> 49:31.050
Okay, fine.

49:31.070 --> 49:33.100
Fine, we'll talk about it later.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.230
No.

49:36.010 --> 49:38.010
This.

49:38.030 --> 49:39.210
You. Me.

49:39.230 --> 49:42.050
I...

49:42.070 --> 49:44.210
It's not working.

49:44.230 --> 49:47.160
Not anymore.

49:50.190 --> 49:52.200
Nicole, come on,
don't say that.

49:52.220 --> 49:55.000
I have to go.

49:59.070 --> 50:02.050
Nicole.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.230
Let's go! Let's go!

51:03.040 --> 51:05.150
Fuck!

51:18.140 --> 51:20.050
I fucked this all up.

51:21.050 --> 51:22.100
I'm sorry.

51:28.130 --> 51:30.040
Do we open fire?

51:30.060 --> 51:32.190
Orders are to take 'em
into custody.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.040
What is that?

52:01.180 --> 52:03.070
What do we do?

52:07.230 --> 52:08.180
<i>Targets have stopped.</i>

52:08.200 --> 52:11.010
Multiple insurgent vehicles
ahead.

52:11.030 --> 52:12.120
Request assistance immediately.

52:12.140 --> 52:16.230
I'm not going out there,
not without backup.

52:21.110 --> 52:24.040
Harry, what are we gonna do?

52:49.120 --> 52:50.130
- No, no, no, no. Harry, listen to me.
- Wait.

52:50.150 --> 52:53.000
Harry. Harry, listen.

52:53.020 --> 52:54.190
Harry.

52:54.210 --> 52:56.120
Harry.

53:02.170 --> 53:04.180
What is he doing?

53:04.200 --> 53:06.160
He fucking insane?

53:12.150 --> 53:15.040
What is he doing?
