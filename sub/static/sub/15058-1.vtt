<i>Mr. Gorbachev,
tear it down this wall.</i>

02:31.796 --> 02:33.672
<i>...bringing
to an end the Soviet empire</i>

02:33.756 --> 02:36.257
<i>and its 70-year experiment
in Communism.</i>

02:36.342 --> 02:38.986
<i>Yet while jubilation
at the prospect of freedom...</i>

02:39.070 --> 02:41.513
<i>...widespread corruption
and economic misery</i>

02:41.597 --> 02:43.932
<i>resulting in a virtual
tidal wave of crime...</i>

02:44.016 --> 02:48.228
<i>The Russian mafia has evolved into
a world-class organized crime network</i>

02:48.312 --> 02:52.315
<i>with profits in billions, including
substantial US operations.</i>

03:02.184 --> 03:06.788
<i>...announcing the unprecedented
opening of an FBI legal attachÃ©</i>

03:07.456 --> 03:12.251
<i>along with the first-ever joint US
and Russian law enforcement operation.</i>

04:35.459 --> 04:36.959
It's her.

05:24.508 --> 05:27.093
- Ghazzi's in the club.
- He's in position.

05:27.177 --> 05:29.554
Okay. Op's a go.
MVD only.

06:32.366 --> 06:37.037
What is this? An American?
Who the fuck are you?

06:37.747 --> 06:40.372
Deputy Director
Carter Preston, FBI.

06:40.457 --> 06:42.374
FBI.

06:42.542 --> 06:47.213
You fuck Americans now,
you ugly militia whore.

06:47.923 --> 06:51.050
And, you,
go fuck yourself.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.302
This is not Chicago.
This is Russia.

06:53.428 --> 06:56.263
So take your bitch and
get the fuck out of here.

06:56.473 --> 06:59.141
Do you think I'm afraid
of the MVD?

07:02.646 --> 07:06.315
I swear I will kill you and your
fucking whore mothers.

07:06.441 --> 07:07.900
I repeat,
you are advised...

07:07.984 --> 07:11.820
Fuck you! Fuck you,
you scar-faced cunt!

07:12.322 --> 07:14.615
Fuck you!
All right, that's enough.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.320
It's never easy
taking a life.

07:54.697 --> 07:58.283
But you saved one,
too. Mine.

08:00.286 --> 08:02.370
Thank you.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.798
We had no warning.

08:13.966 --> 08:16.384
They must have ambushed
our man outside.

08:16.719 --> 08:18.720
Before we knew it,
there were militia

08:18.804 --> 08:21.306
with their guns out in
every corner of the room.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.725
They just opened fire
and killed him.

08:25.060 --> 08:29.522
It happened so fast, it was
over before it started.

08:29.732 --> 08:32.859
God, my poor brother.

08:36.572 --> 08:39.073
How many militia
did you kill?

08:41.201 --> 08:43.494
Terek, please,
we didn't stand a chance.

08:43.578 --> 08:45.496
There were 30 of them,

08:45.581 --> 08:46.706
plus the Americans.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.250
Yes, yes, but how many
did you kill?

08:50.836 --> 08:51.836
Well...

08:53.172 --> 08:55.381
Well, none.

08:55.924 --> 08:58.009
None? Not even one?

08:59.093 --> 09:01.053
Terek, please.

09:01.596 --> 09:03.347
I did what I could.

09:05.350 --> 09:08.935
You did what you could.
You did what you could.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.856
You let those militia pigs and that
American scum kill my brother

09:13.566 --> 09:16.443
without killing
one in return.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.946
Okay,
that's what you could do.

09:20.782 --> 09:22.783
Here's what I can do.

09:32.418 --> 09:34.378
I loved this man
like a brother.

09:35.129 --> 09:37.798
He was a dear friend
and partner to me.

09:38.466 --> 09:40.926
So I took no joy in that.

09:42.261 --> 09:44.262
But just think,

09:44.764 --> 09:47.140
if I could do this
to one I love,

09:47.683 --> 09:49.768
what could I do
to someone I hate?

09:50.812 --> 09:51.853
Hmm?

09:53.981 --> 09:58.318
So, the American FBI
declares war on us?

10:02.824 --> 10:04.991
Then war it is.

10:05.993 --> 10:09.078
Unlike other less
cunning predators,

10:09.162 --> 10:14.166
the hyena takes no chances,
never attacking unless sure of a kill.

10:15.127 --> 10:19.672
Though a consummate killer,
he is clearly no gentleman.

10:23.468 --> 10:26.011
I apologize
for keeping you waiting.

10:26.138 --> 10:28.931
I had some other business
to dispose of.

10:29.015 --> 10:30.599
So much wasted time

10:30.684 --> 10:34.019
confusing motion with accomplishment.
Another drink?

10:50.370 --> 10:52.663
The MVD killed my brother.

10:52.914 --> 10:56.167
For that, I will see
they drown in blood.

10:56.334 --> 11:00.546
But to their allies in America,
I wish to send a message.

11:01.047 --> 11:03.632
A very public message.

11:03.717 --> 11:07.094
I want to strike fear into
the marrow of their bones.

11:09.890 --> 11:12.224
Can you kill this person?

11:14.936 --> 11:15.936
Yes.

11:23.402 --> 11:25.987
If I take this job,
I'll have to disappear

11:26.071 --> 11:27.405
forever.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.409
So if you want me
to do this, you're going
to have to pay me.

11:31.911 --> 11:33.703
How much?

11:34.538 --> 11:36.122
American dollars.

11:36.248 --> 11:38.374
All cash, of course.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.960
Half now,
half upon completion.

11:45.925 --> 11:47.926
$70 million.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.932
Why not?

11:54.642 --> 11:55.808
Done.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.728
How many people
know about this?

11:58.812 --> 12:00.021
You and I.

12:00.105 --> 12:01.439
Keep it that way.

12:02.107 --> 12:05.443
Don't refer
to our arrangement by
telephone or fax, ever.

12:06.237 --> 12:10.532
You should find a place
outside of Russia to hide
until the mission's completed.

12:10.616 --> 12:12.283
If word of this leaks,
it'll be my choice

12:12.368 --> 12:13.952
whether to continue
the mission or not.

12:14.620 --> 12:18.581
Either way,
I keep the initial payment.
Agreed?

12:19.458 --> 12:20.542
Okay.

12:22.920 --> 12:27.714
Informants tell us
Terek's put bounties on
all MVD and FBI personnel.

12:27.799 --> 12:31.510
Deputy Director Preston
and I have special bounties
on our lives.

12:31.636 --> 12:34.638
In two weeks,
seven MVD operatives
have been killed.

12:34.764 --> 12:36.139
At least we know
we're getting to him.

12:36.224 --> 12:38.308
Informants say
this is just the start.

12:38.434 --> 12:40.978
Terek's planning
something more dramatic.

12:42.313 --> 12:43.480
Eight days ago,

12:43.565 --> 12:45.190
Terek and his two top
lieutenants were spotted

12:45.275 --> 12:46.858
at a pension
in the town of Porvoo,

12:46.943 --> 12:48.860
60 kilometers
west of Helsinki.

12:48.987 --> 12:51.905
They've been there ever since,
taking the entire third floor
for themselves

12:51.990 --> 12:53.448
and their bodyguards,

12:53.533 --> 12:56.785
all former Spetsnaz,
nine in all.

12:56.869 --> 12:59.454
Not one's left the building
in five days.

12:59.539 --> 13:03.667
Their only contact with
the outside is this man,
Victor Politovsky.

13:03.751 --> 13:06.378
He goes to
the Porvoo post office twice
a day for Terek's mail

13:06.462 --> 13:08.755
which arrives
general delivery.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.967
Contact Interpol
and get everything
you can on Politovsky.

13:12.051 --> 13:13.093
Yes, sir.

13:13.177 --> 13:17.347
Terek's men are
notoriously hard to turn out.
Should we get the opportunity

13:17.473 --> 13:21.977
we must be prepared
to conduct the interrogation
with the utmost efficiency.

13:22.061 --> 13:23.437
Good day to you,
Mr. Preston.

13:23.521 --> 13:24.771
Sir.

13:29.986 --> 13:33.030
I don't think
I want to know
what that means.

15:24.306 --> 15:26.725
The new lamination's
the tricky part.

15:26.976 --> 15:29.269
You got to use
ethyl acetone.

15:29.353 --> 15:33.064
Nasty stuff.
Gives you liver cancer.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.234
And I use a disc drive
to erase the magnetic strip.

15:38.487 --> 15:39.654
It's perfect.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.947
Thank you.

15:41.031 --> 15:42.741
You really do
beautiful work.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.951
Oh, well. Art comes
in various guises,
doesn't it?

15:45.035 --> 15:46.411
Yes, it does.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.746
What do I owe you?

15:47.830 --> 15:49.497
Right.

15:50.374 --> 15:54.753
Well, I think your balance
is about L375.

15:55.504 --> 15:56.795
This is L500.

15:57.297 --> 15:58.839
Oh, thank you.

15:58.923 --> 15:59.923
Good luck with the baby.

16:00.008 --> 16:01.675
Thank you.
Cheers.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.177
See you next time.

16:28.703 --> 16:30.370
How do you want
the accounts handled?

16:30.455 --> 16:33.290
Split the deposit equally
between the Macao
and the Panama accounts.

16:33.374 --> 16:34.541
And the balance?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.210
Leave it here in dollars.

16:36.294 --> 16:38.670
I'll need you to open me
a Luxembourg account.

16:38.755 --> 16:39.963
And get me
some credit cards.

16:40.048 --> 16:43.342
Use an American bank.
I'll send you the names
this week.

16:43.426 --> 16:46.595
I'll overnight
the credit cards to
your box in Montreal.

16:46.679 --> 16:48.722
Oh. This also came
in the draft.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.140
Ah. Yes.

16:50.225 --> 16:51.809
I'll need to use
your computer, Clive.

16:51.893 --> 16:52.893
Of course.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.102
Everything's ready for you.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.729
Good. Thank you.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.528
- Good afternoon.
- How may we help you?

17:02.612 --> 17:06.489
I'm interested in
an intermediate range system,
high cyclic rate.

17:09.117 --> 17:10.617
Man portable?

17:10.702 --> 17:12.662
Compact,
vehicle-mounted unit.

17:13.622 --> 17:14.914
What caliber?

17:14.998 --> 17:17.375
No smaller than 7.62.

17:17.459 --> 17:18.751
Available:

17:18.919 --> 17:23.631
7.62 millimeter
M134 electric Gatling gun.

17:24.340 --> 17:27.801
I prefer non-US equipment,
single-parallel system.

17:28.428 --> 17:29.512
Available:

17:29.596 --> 17:33.766
Yugoslav 20 millimeter
19/55 cannon.

17:34.977 --> 17:36.644
Too heavy.

17:36.770 --> 17:37.937
Available:

17:38.021 --> 17:42.191
Polish ZSU-33 electric,
14.5 millimeter.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.944
1,400 rounds per minute.

17:46.697 --> 17:47.989
Interested.

17:48.115 --> 17:51.909
3,500 meters.

17:51.994 --> 17:56.038
1,700 meters per second.

17:57.082 --> 17:58.165
I'll take it.

17:58.250 --> 18:02.003
Cost will be $200,000 US.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.632
Transfer of funds
in the usual manner.
Half now, half on delivery

18:06.717 --> 18:08.259
to the following address.

18:08.510 --> 18:12.597
Letterham Shipping,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada,

18:12.681 --> 18:15.432
GIH 876.

18:15.683 --> 18:18.018
Client name,
Murdock, Charles C.

18:28.195 --> 18:31.740
"What are they planning?
Why is Terek in Finland?"

18:31.824 --> 18:35.493
"The Americans.
Kill. Example."

18:35.953 --> 18:39.497
"Jackal? What Jackal?
It doesn't make sense."

18:40.041 --> 18:41.958
"What are they planning
at work?"

18:43.920 --> 18:45.587
"Who are you?"

18:49.759 --> 18:51.718
"You fucking Jackal."

18:56.140 --> 18:59.017
"Why you hanging around?
Revive him."

19:01.437 --> 19:03.063
Jesus.

19:05.024 --> 19:09.319
Drug-assisted interrogation
is perfectly legal
in matters of state security.

19:09.570 --> 19:13.573
Unfortunately,
Mr. Politovsky had an
undiagnosed heart condition.

19:15.034 --> 19:18.036
He said, "Jackal"?

19:18.996 --> 19:21.581
Does this mean
something to you,
Mr. Preston?

19:21.874 --> 19:24.792
There's supposedly
a killer for hire
who uses that name.

19:24.876 --> 19:27.336
Several assassinations
are credited to him,

19:27.420 --> 19:30.881
but we've never been
able to prove
if he even exists.

19:44.145 --> 19:46.563
From time to time,
he was KGB asset.

19:47.232 --> 19:48.482
Do you have a name?

19:48.566 --> 19:50.067
No name.

19:50.443 --> 19:53.404
Payments were made
to the contracting
organization

19:53.488 --> 19:55.614
or a Hong Kong
bank account.

19:55.699 --> 19:57.992
No KGB member
has ever seen him.

19:58.076 --> 20:00.661
Do we know if he ever
operated in the US?

20:00.912 --> 20:03.122
No. But

20:05.291 --> 20:08.460
Politovsky's briefcase
contained biographical
material

20:08.545 --> 20:11.338
on your Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.

20:11.881 --> 20:15.092
Jesus Christ.
This guy's going
for the gold, huh?

20:15.176 --> 20:16.719
Get him on
the phone for me.

20:16.803 --> 20:17.845
Yes, sir.

20:43.328 --> 20:45.913
Good morning.

20:45.998 --> 20:47.999
Purpose of your
visit to Canada?

20:48.083 --> 20:49.125
Steelhead.

20:49.418 --> 20:50.626
Hmm?

20:51.253 --> 20:53.046
Fishing.

20:54.715 --> 20:56.924
Enjoy your stay,
Mr. Hayslip.

20:57.009 --> 20:58.593
Thank you. I will.

21:02.681 --> 21:04.891
I'll give you
a good deal on this minivan,
you know.

21:04.975 --> 21:06.809
It's brand-new.
It's fully loaded.

21:06.894 --> 21:09.103
We've even got
a six-disc CD changer
for you.

21:09.188 --> 21:12.023
Now, the only thing I need
right now is your driver's
license, your credit card

21:12.107 --> 21:13.941
and I'll check this
with the credit manager.

21:14.026 --> 21:15.526
I think everything should
be okay, Mr. Murdock.

21:15.611 --> 21:16.986
Make it Charlie, aye?

21:17.071 --> 21:18.488
All right then, Charlie.
See you in a second.

21:18.572 --> 21:19.822
Take your time.

22:29.225 --> 22:32.227
I want this op close-hold,
no publicity.

22:32.937 --> 22:36.481
Put a working group together.
State, CIA, Secret Service,

22:37.108 --> 22:38.817
Russian Embassy.

22:38.901 --> 22:43.071
They'll have daily
progress reports, 9:00 p.m.
every evening, this office.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.324
Major Koslova,
anything else?

22:46.409 --> 22:51.413
Since 1 983,
KGB provided funding for
five direct-action missions.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.623
One bombing
and four assassinations
by gunshot.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.917
The Jackal was
the operative used.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.962
Not giving me much
to work with, Preston.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.714
We don't have much, sir.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.508
Major Koslova's informers
can't finger him.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.511
They don't know who he is,
CIA can't track him.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.263
Then what?

23:09.347 --> 23:12.141
Using KGB files,
I've identified
six operatives

23:12.267 --> 23:14.185
we believe to have
actually seen him.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.853
Four are dead,
one in Libya,

23:15.937 --> 23:18.439
but the last is
believed to be here
in the United States.

23:18.523 --> 23:21.984
A Basque separatist
name Isabella Celia Zancona.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.278
She might at least know
what he looks like.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.947
But we have no idea
of her whereabouts.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.115
Well,
someone must have.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.619
Interpol says that
in the '80s
she was involved with

23:31.703 --> 23:34.496
one Declan Joseph Mulqueen,
an IRA sharpshooter.

23:34.623 --> 23:35.664
The word is
he burned out, sir.

23:35.749 --> 23:39.210
They decided to get him out
of Ireland entirely,
shipped him over here.

23:39.294 --> 23:43.464
In '89, he picked up
twice 25 years for some old
weapons trafficking charges.

23:43.548 --> 23:47.384
He's serving time
at a maximum-security
state pen in Massachusetts.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.803
All right.
Say he does know
where she is.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.764
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

23:51.848 --> 23:54.975
I'm hoping he'll cooperate
for a reduced sentence.

23:55.060 --> 23:59.146
- But don't promise too much.
- After all, he's a terrorist.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.539
You got some visitors,
Mulqueen.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.758
What do you want
with Isabella?
She's done nothing here.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.927
She entered
the country illegally.

24:33.722 --> 24:38.977
What? The FBI's sending
deputy directors out
after illegal aliens?

24:41.021 --> 24:43.773
Give over, Preston.
Who you really looking for?

24:43.941 --> 24:47.277
A pro.
Calls himself "The Jackal."

24:48.946 --> 24:50.780
That fellow.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.866
The mystery man.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.745
We think she might have
seen him and may be
able to help us find him.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.164
If so, we'll arrange
a pardon for her

25:00.374 --> 25:02.792
signed by
the President of
the United States.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.587
And guarantee no extradition.
We'd also guarantee
the Spanish government

25:06.672 --> 25:08.631
will never know
her whereabouts.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.466
They don't know now,
do they?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.467
And neither do you.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.469
Let's keep it that way.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.148
Would it matter
that you might be
saving a human life?

25:26.232 --> 25:29.735
And whose human life would
I be saving that would be
important enough for all this?

25:29.944 --> 25:32.988
Mr. Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.284
Wouldn't that be droll?

25:38.911 --> 25:42.873
Look. We know that
certain gang elements in
this prison want you dead.

25:42.957 --> 25:45.500
An entire government
wants me dead, mister.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.585
Yet here I am.

25:46.669 --> 25:49.087
All right, smart ass,
let's cut the bullshit.

25:49.672 --> 25:53.175
You cooperate and
we'll get you transferred to
a minimum-security facility.

25:53.259 --> 25:54.843
That's our deal.

25:54.927 --> 25:56.094
And that's your only chance

25:56.179 --> 25:58.513
to ever walk out
of this goddamn place
in one piece.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.641
That's a one-time offer.
Now take it or leave it.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.978
Stuff it then,
as many fucking times
as you like.

26:05.396 --> 26:07.981
Pardon the language.
I've been in prison.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.413
All right,
what will it take
for you to help us?

26:26.500 --> 26:29.960
First, I'd have to be
convinced Isabella
would be kept safe.

26:30.087 --> 26:31.670
Done.

26:32.506 --> 26:34.090
Then you'd have
to let me go.

26:34.174 --> 26:36.592
Back to Ireland,
a free man.

26:37.010 --> 26:39.136
Out of the question.

26:40.764 --> 26:44.392
Besides gunrunning,
you're a known killer of
British government personnel.

26:44.476 --> 26:47.019
Not to mention all the women
and children you've probably
blown up.

26:47.104 --> 26:50.314
It's not my war.
I was never a bomber.

26:50.399 --> 26:53.401
I don't see the distinction.
You still took human lives.

26:53.485 --> 26:57.363
The distinction is I killed
in a war. Now I want
to go home. Simple as that.

26:57.447 --> 26:58.781
Simple for you, perhaps.

26:58.865 --> 27:01.909
Look, even in Russia,
soldiers go home when
the treaty's signed, nyet?

27:01.993 --> 27:04.745
Well, that's not
gonna happen. Sorry.

27:07.332 --> 27:09.583
All right,
just the chance then.

27:11.336 --> 27:13.796
Your best efforts
to get me free.

27:14.548 --> 27:16.632
I'll settle for
your word on it.

27:18.427 --> 27:19.677
Sorry.

27:23.723 --> 27:26.267
So the Jackal's after
your director, is he?

27:26.351 --> 27:28.519
Best tell him to get
his affairs in order

27:28.895 --> 27:30.646
because nobody
can save him now.

27:30.730 --> 27:34.190
Nobody except me.
Because I met him.

27:38.571 --> 27:40.780
Oh, yeah,
didn't I mention it?

27:52.751 --> 27:56.671
I can identify him
by his face,
given the opportunity,

27:56.964 --> 27:59.299
but more importantly,
by his methods.

28:01.343 --> 28:04.095
So you can leave
Isabella out of this.

28:04.763 --> 28:06.639
Did you work with him?

28:06.724 --> 28:09.350
With him?
No. No way.

28:12.062 --> 28:14.314
Do you have a problem
with this man?

28:16.358 --> 28:18.776
That's between
him and me.

28:24.158 --> 28:27.577
Isabella Zancona
is the only confirmed
contact we have

28:27.661 --> 28:29.829
and we will find her.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.707
With or without your help.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.876
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:37.296 --> 28:40.380
I want three things.
One, get me out of here.

28:40.507 --> 28:42.466
I'm no use to you
sitting here on my ass.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.510
What's to keep you from
trying to taking off?

28:44.594 --> 28:46.512
Nothing.

28:46.846 --> 28:48.764
Except I give you my word.

28:50.225 --> 28:53.435
Two, I go with you
to meet Isabella.

28:54.187 --> 28:55.812
Why?

28:56.439 --> 28:58.565
I want to see her, is all.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.446
And the third thing?

29:05.740 --> 29:07.741
A decent razor.

29:12.121 --> 29:13.830
Here's how
it's gonna go, Mulqueen.

29:13.915 --> 29:15.624
You will be searched
on a random schedule.

29:15.708 --> 29:18.460
And if we turn up as much
as a paper clip that
hasn't been authorized,

29:18.545 --> 29:20.254
I'll send you
right back to prison.

29:20.338 --> 29:21.755
Same goes for using
the telephone.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.340
What?
You don't trust me?

29:23.424 --> 29:25.092
As far as I can throw you.

29:25.176 --> 29:27.135
But I have little choice.

29:27.220 --> 29:30.264
If you've got any thoughts
about an IRA snatch,

29:30.390 --> 29:32.474
we'll shoot to kill,
them and you.

29:32.559 --> 29:35.561
And not necessarily
in that order.
Understand?

29:35.645 --> 29:37.521
I heard you.

29:37.605 --> 29:40.357
Go along
and we'll get along.

29:50.284 --> 29:52.243
I'm gonna keep
a real good eye on you.

29:57.332 --> 29:59.292
Miss Koslova, is it?

29:59.501 --> 30:00.835
Mmm-hmm.

30:06.508 --> 30:08.718
What would
your first name be then?

30:09.595 --> 30:11.220
Major.

30:11.972 --> 30:14.223
Major Koslova.

30:20.981 --> 30:23.149
A wee bit rusty,
that's all.

30:39.249 --> 30:42.752
Subassembly
of titanium, as light as
the stresses will allow.

30:43.545 --> 30:45.963
The arm's got to
traverse 270 degrees.

30:46.048 --> 30:48.883
Feed and drive mechanisms
run on 21 0 amp servos.

30:48.967 --> 30:51.093
The whole thing has got
to run off 1 2-volt DC.

30:51.178 --> 30:54.722
Okay. Yeah,
it's a car battery.
That's cool.

30:54.806 --> 30:56.599
How much weight is
the arm gonna have
to support?

30:56.683 --> 30:58.267
Fifty-five kilograms.

30:58.352 --> 31:01.394
It's a big fucker, yeah?

31:02.188 --> 31:03.938
Hey, you want one?

31:04.023 --> 31:05.440
No.

31:06.484 --> 31:08.902
I'm gonna want this
in eight days.

31:09.195 --> 31:10.779
I can do that.

31:11.072 --> 31:12.364
Okay.

31:12.448 --> 31:14.074
How much?

31:16.369 --> 31:18.703
Well, the titanium's
gonna be a problem.

31:18.788 --> 31:20.705
It's a listed material
up here. It's gonna take
some time,

31:20.790 --> 31:22.082
a little more money.

31:23.668 --> 31:25.502
$50,000?

31:29.090 --> 31:33.218
I mean, like, well, 40.
Forty grand.

31:35.096 --> 31:38.431
All right. Half now,
half on delivery.

31:40.184 --> 31:43.186
This sucker's definitely
gonna kick some ass, yeah?

31:45.815 --> 31:47.399
Get this straight.

31:47.608 --> 31:51.319
When you finish this unit,
you're gonna turn over the
plans and any scrap material.

31:51.404 --> 31:54.948
You're gonna forget about
Charlie Murdock and the tech
specs on these plans.

31:55.032 --> 31:57.575
Yeah. Shit, man, I'm cool.

31:58.119 --> 31:59.452
Relax.

32:02.415 --> 32:04.165
All right.

32:33.862 --> 32:35.612
Are you nervous?

32:38.658 --> 32:41.827
Eight years.
That's a lifetime,
isn't it?

32:44.289 --> 32:45.956
Hello.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.333
Mr. Decker, is it?
Yes.

32:48.418 --> 32:51.336
Yeah. Hello there.
I'm Declan Mulqueen.

32:51.713 --> 32:54.965
This is Major Koslova.

32:55.049 --> 32:56.049
How do you do?

32:56.134 --> 32:57.176
Hi.

32:57.510 --> 32:59.595
We'd like to speak
to your wife.

33:01.222 --> 33:03.599
Izz,
someone to see you.

33:41.804 --> 33:44.180
I'll take the kids
out back.

33:46.308 --> 33:48.059
Daddy, who's that?

33:49.061 --> 33:51.229
My beautiful Irish...

34:04.618 --> 34:06.994
They let me out
to ask you something.

34:08.621 --> 34:12.667
Sir, I was thinking maybe
we could use the Zancona
woman as insurance

34:12.960 --> 34:14.335
in case Mulqueen
gets happy feet.

34:14.418 --> 34:15.503
Listen,

34:15.587 --> 34:17.713
however he plays it,
we play it straight.

34:17.797 --> 34:21.132
Isabella Zancona's
involvement
remains classified.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.969
That means nothing
in the report.

34:24.179 --> 34:26.931
No name, no location,
nothing. Got it?

34:27.431 --> 34:28.764
Yes, sir.

34:33.312 --> 34:35.981
I never knew
his name, but he was
definitely American.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.525
He had some kind of
special military training

34:38.609 --> 34:41.652
where he learned Spanish,
in El Salvador, I think.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.322
I didn't like
talking to him.

34:44.447 --> 34:47.492
I suppose we were
all dangerous people

34:47.618 --> 34:50.286
but he was different.

34:50.371 --> 34:54.040
I mean, Declan was fire,
all passion.
He had a cause.

34:54.208 --> 34:57.794
This man was ice.
No feeling, nothing.

34:58.379 --> 35:01.548
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Decker.
You've been very helpful.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.552
Incidentally,
it would be best if you keep
our conversation confidential,

35:05.636 --> 35:06.928
even from your husband.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.806
Don't worry about George.

35:10.182 --> 35:13.685
He doesn't know
anything about my past
and he doesn't want to.

35:13.811 --> 35:17.022
All he needs to know
is that I love him.

35:20.484 --> 35:22.485
I see. Well,

35:23.362 --> 35:25.196
I thank you again.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.199
I'll wait for you
in the car.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.501
This opens a locker
at Norfolk Greyhound
Terminal.

35:40.003 --> 35:43.714
Inside is a clean passport
and $1 0,000 cash.

35:44.174 --> 35:47.551
Your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up.

35:48.178 --> 35:51.388
Take it and go
back to Ireland.

35:52.182 --> 35:53.682
I can't.

35:54.184 --> 35:55.809
What?

35:57.228 --> 35:59.146
You gave your word? Huh?

36:00.857 --> 36:03.317
Go now.

36:03.401 --> 36:06.695
Once he kills whoever
he's after, they'll send
you back to prison.

36:06.780 --> 36:09.281
When I believe that,
I'll use the key.

36:22.879 --> 36:24.797
Are you happy at least?

36:24.881 --> 36:27.967
Yes. I love my children.

36:29.135 --> 36:32.554
And my husband,
in my way, I mean.

36:42.565 --> 36:47.068
Some nights I can
close my eyes and sleep

36:49.780 --> 36:52.448
and no dead faces
come to wake me.

36:52.950 --> 36:55.410
That's more than
I ever had.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.748
You wouldn't have me
give that up, would you?

37:04.753 --> 37:07.171
Give me some credit,
will you?

37:40.080 --> 37:42.415
She's Basque,
isn't she?

37:43.959 --> 37:45.334
Aye.

37:45.961 --> 37:48.463
They say Basques
live by the vendetta.

37:49.131 --> 37:51.591
If they hate someone,
it's to the death.

37:51.675 --> 37:54.093
It's the same way
when they love.

37:57.430 --> 37:59.806
My first name is Valentina.

38:06.481 --> 38:08.523
You have family in Russia?

38:08.649 --> 38:11.651
My parents.
My brother,
in the navy.

38:11.778 --> 38:13.820
Husband? Kids?

38:14.280 --> 38:17.324
No. I have not
found the time.

38:21.496 --> 38:25.457
In truth, it's never
been a conflict for me.

38:25.666 --> 38:28.668
This is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman.

38:36.844 --> 38:38.095
By the way,

38:38.179 --> 38:40.889
whatever Isabella
gave you after I left,

38:41.182 --> 38:45.185
I trust you won't use it
until after our business
is concluded.

38:46.687 --> 38:48.605
Don't miss a thing,
do you?

38:48.689 --> 38:50.398
No, Mr. Mulqueen.

38:51.526 --> 38:53.360
I see everything.

39:03.538 --> 39:06.664
Maybe we should
start by canceling
your public appearances.

39:06.748 --> 39:09.542
No, I don't think
that's necessary.
I mean, not yet.

39:09.668 --> 39:13.170
This fellow's gonna need
to make preparations.
He'll need time.

39:13.255 --> 39:14.713
How tight are the borders?

39:14.798 --> 39:16.590
Mexico and Canada have...

39:17.592 --> 39:21.387
Mr. Mulqueen?
Something you'd like
to share with us?

39:22.556 --> 39:25.015
He'll likely be using
four false identities.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.102
Three will be on him,
and one in reserve
at a drop box somewhere.

39:28.186 --> 39:29.854
At least that's the way
he used to operate.

39:29.938 --> 39:31.522
What matter if he has 40?

39:31.606 --> 39:35.860
It's still one man.
Might we not be creating
a storm in a tea cup?

39:35.944 --> 39:38.028
Exactly. I agree
with you 1 00 percent.

39:39.906 --> 39:41.907
Director Bolitonov.

39:41.992 --> 39:45.703
Terek has always made
doing his own killing
a point of honor.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.247
Usually very bloody
and very public.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.583
A statement,
if you will.

39:50.876 --> 39:53.294
So, if he's hired
an outsider,

39:53.378 --> 39:56.547
obviously, this is something
he takes very seriously.

39:56.631 --> 39:58.966
Until this Jackal
is captured or killed,

39:59.259 --> 40:01.427
I don't think we can
afford to do any less.

40:01.553 --> 40:04.930
Come on.
Let's get real here, okay?
I mean, it's one guy.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.099
It's just one guy.
Bolitonov's right.

40:07.934 --> 40:11.103
With the assets in this room,
the guy is as good as got.

40:11.229 --> 40:13.522
That's if he doesn't go ahead
and stick his dick
in a wringer first,

40:13.607 --> 40:17.192
like a lot of these clowns.
Remember that guy?
What was his name?

40:19.278 --> 40:21.112
What's that,
Mr. Mulqueen?

40:22.114 --> 40:25.283
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown,
but this man is no clown.

40:25.492 --> 40:27.952
He knows all your moves,
back to front.

40:28.662 --> 40:31.080
Right now, you got a name.
That's all you got.

40:31.165 --> 40:34.500
The Jackal's got a target.
You. He's got a timetable.

40:34.627 --> 40:38.630
And as to making mistakes,
he's spent 20 years in a trade
that doesn't forgive error.

40:38.756 --> 40:40.673
And he's prevailed.

40:41.926 --> 40:44.385
You think he's the one
who is up against us?

40:44.470 --> 40:45.762
It's the other way around.

41:47.448 --> 41:49.366
Hi.
Hi.

41:50.994 --> 41:53.453
Can I buy you a drink?

41:53.538 --> 41:54.621
Yeah.

42:07.385 --> 42:09.720
I think you should
come home with me.

42:11.472 --> 42:13.140
I'd love to

42:14.058 --> 42:16.018
but I can't.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.978
I have to go
back to Atlanta

42:18.062 --> 42:20.856
to finalize
my very messy divorce.

42:23.318 --> 42:25.068
Does she know?

42:25.194 --> 42:27.070
She does now.

42:30.408 --> 42:32.326
So how am I gonna
see you again?

42:32.410 --> 42:34.910
You could give me
one of your cards.

42:41.543 --> 42:43.419
You're not gonna call.

42:43.587 --> 42:45.379
Douglas.

42:47.716 --> 42:51.260
You just have to have
a little faith in people,
that's all.

42:51.595 --> 42:53.554
Like I do.

44:05.918 --> 44:08.420
Open your shirt.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.465
Easy now. Easy.

44:12.550 --> 44:13.591
Now!

44:16.512 --> 44:18.304
Easy.

44:18.848 --> 44:20.598
Open your shirt.

44:20.683 --> 44:22.517
Easy now.

44:29.608 --> 44:32.360
Souvenirs of
British hospitality.

44:37.908 --> 44:38.992
I apologize.

44:43.414 --> 44:44.664
No problem.

44:44.748 --> 44:49.169
Oslo Travel came up
with a James William Hayslip
who flew from Toronto,

44:49.253 --> 44:52.005
August 25, two days before
the meeting with Terek.

44:52.089 --> 44:56.508
We checked the Social Security
number on his passport,
and guess what?

44:57.719 --> 44:58.969
It belongs to an inmate

44:59.053 --> 45:02.598
committed to
a mental institution
in Virginia 1 2 years ago.

45:03.850 --> 45:06.310
Now, Canadian Travel
says he flew

45:06.394 --> 45:09.730
to Montreal nine days ago.

45:57.403 --> 45:58.403
Hello?

45:59.864 --> 46:00.906
Hello?

46:00.990 --> 46:03.241
Yeah?
Yeah, Charlie Murdock.

46:03.492 --> 46:05.117
Picking up a delivery, eh?

46:07.538 --> 46:09.455
Invoice.

46:09.748 --> 46:11.290
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

46:11.375 --> 46:12.750
It's a hot one, eh?

46:12.834 --> 46:13.876
You can say that again.

47:17.189 --> 47:20.609
Hi. I need to use
one of your computers.

47:21.402 --> 47:23.320
Sure. Any one.

47:27.908 --> 47:29.743
Can I get online with this?

47:29.827 --> 47:31.745
Yeah, sure.

50:17.910 --> 50:20.119
Go check upstairs.

51:50.959 --> 51:52.877
Thank you.

51:53.378 --> 51:55.212
Hayslip's disappeared.

51:55.297 --> 51:58.924
Border Patrol has
the passport photo,
but nothing's shown up yet.

51:59.301 --> 52:00.801
He's moved on.
I told you.

52:00.886 --> 52:02.845
One moment.

52:02.971 --> 52:05.806
The only place we're sure
he's been is Montreal.

52:06.057 --> 52:09.518
What if he started using
the next identity there?

52:10.020 --> 52:11.520
I'm not following you.

52:11.646 --> 52:14.481
Hayslip disappeared,
that doesn't mean
the Jackal did.

52:14.566 --> 52:16.650
Perhaps something
has happened.

52:18.153 --> 52:22.239
Witherspoon, have the Montreal
police go through their logs
for the last 48 hours.

52:22.324 --> 52:25.200
If he's on to the next name,
it's because it's in the plan.

52:25.327 --> 52:26.410
A man like this
doesn't make mistakes.

52:26.494 --> 52:27.578
No?

52:27.662 --> 52:30.247
They always make one,
somewhere.

52:30.498 --> 52:32.833
Isn't that how
you were caught?

52:34.336 --> 52:35.628
Ouch.

52:44.262 --> 52:46.347
What's her story, then?

52:47.015 --> 52:48.891
Major Koslova

52:49.434 --> 52:52.686
ends the debate about
women in combat,
as far as I'm concerned.

52:52.771 --> 52:54.188
How's that?

52:55.190 --> 52:58.359
When she saved my life
and took out Terek's brother,

52:58.944 --> 53:02.862
she did it knowing she'd
be drawing a death sentence
down on her own neck.

53:03.405 --> 53:08.117
But when we offered
to set her up someplace
else when this is over,

53:08.202 --> 53:10.578
you know what she said?

53:11.372 --> 53:14.248
"The good guys don't hide."

53:17.127 --> 53:18.586
Fierce woman.

53:18.671 --> 53:22.131
In that country,
under that system...

53:23.801 --> 53:25.385
Staggering.

53:28.889 --> 53:32.266
Oh, shit, you know what?
I couldn't get titanium.

53:32.393 --> 53:35.520
So, I had a friend
mould the base out
of carbon fiber instead.

53:35.604 --> 53:38.690
Came in 23 kilos
under the weight
you asked for.

53:38.774 --> 53:39.774
Is that cool?

53:39.858 --> 53:41.067
Yeah, that's great.

53:41.652 --> 53:45.655
I'm still gonna want
the plans, the mould and the
scrap material. Remember?

53:45.739 --> 53:48.783
Yeah. Um... Hmm.

53:49.743 --> 53:51.619
Maybe we ought to
talk about that.

53:51.704 --> 53:52.787
Oh?

53:52.871 --> 53:54.247
See, uh...

53:55.416 --> 53:57.041
Well, I mean, this rig,

53:57.126 --> 54:00.420
I figure it's to support
something pretty heavy,
right?

54:00.796 --> 54:04.465
Like a Gatling gun,
maybe?

54:05.217 --> 54:07.760
Or a 20-millimeter cannon?

54:07.845 --> 54:10.512
So you gotta be shooting
at something pretty big,
right?

54:10.596 --> 54:12.514
Armored car, maybe?

54:13.766 --> 54:15.183
Bank vault?

54:15.268 --> 54:19.521
I don't know. You know, you
could be shooting a fucking
airliner for all I know.

54:19.772 --> 54:21.857
But the point is,

54:22.275 --> 54:25.944
a job like this
can attract
a lot of attention.

54:27.613 --> 54:29.281
I don't want
any attention.

54:29.365 --> 54:31.950
Right, right.
And that's why I'm saying.

54:32.368 --> 54:35.620
I think the plans
and mould are worth
a little bonus.

54:36.789 --> 54:37.956
How much?

54:38.041 --> 54:39.124
I don't know.

54:40.376 --> 54:42.169
$1 00,000?

54:44.505 --> 54:46.214
Come on, man.
You know it's worth it.

54:46.299 --> 54:48.800
You got a serious piece
of equipment there.

54:58.311 --> 55:00.312
All right.

55:00.646 --> 55:02.689
I'll get you
$50,000 tomorrow.

55:03.608 --> 55:07.569
I'm gonna need a place to
test this, though. Someplace
that won't draw any attention.

55:07.653 --> 55:10.864
We got a place like that.
We got a place just like that.

55:27.172 --> 55:31.592
Target's in place.
Man, I think I should have
brought some beer.

55:37.265 --> 55:41.018
Motherfuckin' motherfucker.

55:41.436 --> 55:45.439
That motherfucker
is state of the art!

55:45.941 --> 55:47.191
Dude, I knew
it was gonna be big.

55:47.275 --> 55:50.444
I didn't know it was
gonna be the fuckin'
prototype cannon.

55:50.612 --> 55:53.197
It's a fucking mole.

55:53.365 --> 55:54.532
Damn.

55:54.616 --> 55:56.158
Some hairy-looking rounds.

55:56.243 --> 55:57.785
Made from depleted uranium.

55:57.869 --> 55:59.620
It'll go through anything.

56:00.205 --> 56:02.039
Once they get inside,
they just spall.

56:02.165 --> 56:04.291
Hell, yeah.
They spall? Yeah.

56:04.876 --> 56:07.044
They get in there,
and they just...

56:08.380 --> 56:09.713
That rocks.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.132
Look at the friggin' lens
on that thing.

56:11.216 --> 56:12.466
Don't touch that.

56:12.551 --> 56:15.469
It's got, like,
a 2,000-mile zoom lens.

56:16.054 --> 56:17.888
That thing is kick-ass.

56:18.390 --> 56:20.891
Dude, is this thing
a prototype, or what?

56:21.393 --> 56:24.562
I bet you it cost you
a shitload. That rocks.

56:25.730 --> 56:27.189
Man, you rock.

56:27.315 --> 56:29.482
Do you know
what I'm saying?

56:29.567 --> 56:31.568
Rock!

56:34.071 --> 56:36.239
Fucking thing
kicks ass.

56:46.208 --> 56:47.542
Oh, yeah.

56:49.086 --> 56:51.671
Bring on the spall, baby.

56:52.006 --> 56:54.507
I can't wait
to see the fuck...
Lamont.

56:55.676 --> 56:57.427
Close your mouth.

57:10.441 --> 57:12.066
Smooth action, yeah?

57:33.923 --> 57:35.548
Ready?

57:41.721 --> 57:44.890
Yeah! Spall!

57:52.065 --> 57:53.482
Well, at least

57:54.442 --> 57:55.567
it took out the target.

57:55.652 --> 57:57.069
No, it's off.

57:57.612 --> 57:58.904
By at least
three millimeters.

57:58.988 --> 58:02.324
No. No, dude.
That's precision
craftsmanship.

58:02.909 --> 58:04.409
It ain't off
no three millimeters.

58:04.494 --> 58:05.786
So, Lamont,

58:07.372 --> 58:09.581
tell me how you sight in
this thing automatically.

58:09.666 --> 58:13.794
Uh, you just, uh, punch in
the windage and the elevation
you want and hit enter.

58:14.504 --> 58:16.296
So you just kind of
guestimate it, huh?

58:16.381 --> 58:18.465
Basically guestimation.

58:21.010 --> 58:21.969
And hit enter.

58:22.053 --> 58:23.053
Uh-huh.

58:26.849 --> 58:29.059
Hey, hey, hey!
I give up!

58:29.227 --> 58:31.144
Well,

58:32.230 --> 58:33.563
I guess the automatic
sighting works.

58:33.648 --> 58:34.648
Yeah.

58:34.732 --> 58:36.608
I thought I was
about to sprawl.

58:36.693 --> 58:39.486
Well, Lamont,
I'm gonna have to
speed test it now.

58:39.570 --> 58:41.238
Mmm. Speed test.

58:41.906 --> 58:44.074
So, run.

58:49.621 --> 58:51.497
What do you mean?

58:52.541 --> 58:55.793
I mean run, now.

59:10.976 --> 59:12.893
Run to your right!

59:40.422 --> 59:42.298
Get up. Get up!

59:46.136 --> 59:48.804
All right, good!
Oh, oh! Stop there!

59:50.307 --> 59:52.224
Just stop there!

59:52.517 --> 59:54.477
Turn around!

59:55.520 --> 59:57.812
Hold out that
pack of cigarettes!

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:02.650
Don't be afraid!

01:00:09.408 --> 01:00:10.992
Stand very still!

01:00:21.754 --> 01:00:23.713
Stand still!

01:00:39.939 --> 01:00:42.190
I told you it was off.

01:00:44.735 --> 01:00:47.278
Move over by the car!

01:00:47.863 --> 01:00:50.532
Quick, before you pass out!

01:01:43.668 --> 01:01:46.545
Here we go, sir.
Major. Mac.

01:01:46.713 --> 01:01:49.673
Eleven days ago,
Charles C. Murdock
bought himself

01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:51.425
a brand-new Dodge minivan.

01:01:51.509 --> 01:01:55.429
Now, that was a big surprise
to Mr. Murdock

01:01:55.513 --> 01:01:59.766
whose passport and wallet
were stolen 16 days ago
at the Helsinki airport.

01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:01.226
Anything
from the border?

01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:04.229
We sent a description
of the van to every crossing
from here to Manitoba.

01:02:04.314 --> 01:02:08.567
I have something.
Uphall Station. It's a small
town outside Ottawa.

01:02:08.651 --> 01:02:10.235
I think your man
has been there.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.570
Let's go.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.671
The owner is Ian Lamont,
small-time hood.

01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:32.924
The coroner has
what's left of him
at Broxburn.

01:02:33.008 --> 01:02:35.218
Yeah,
we get the idea.
Let's get to the shop.

01:02:45.312 --> 01:02:47.688
Hello. Think I got
something here.

01:02:54.112 --> 01:02:55.446
What is it?

01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:58.241
This is a remote
firing station.

01:02:58.617 --> 01:03:00.243
See, it maneuvers
a weapon.

01:03:00.327 --> 01:03:04.539
The servos run off
a remote control,
like a model airplane.

01:03:04.623 --> 01:03:07.542
We used to make these things
for mortars or such,

01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:09.835
but nothing
like this size.

01:03:10.295 --> 01:03:12.296
He needs a van
just to move it around.

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.049
What would something
this size be used for?

01:03:15.133 --> 01:03:17.885
Antiaircraft?
No, no, you can buy
a mount for that.

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.845
No, a missile's
the best thing for
an aircraft.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:23.015
No, this is for
something else entirely.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.809
Something with
one hell of a range.

01:03:25.893 --> 01:03:27.978
Not just the range, though.

01:03:28.062 --> 01:03:30.647
See, if it is a gun,
it's the cyclic rate.

01:03:31.482 --> 01:03:35.819
You can send off 100 bullets
before the first one
ever hits the target.

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:42.367
Good thing
about a boat like this
is it sells itself.

01:03:42.493 --> 01:03:45.912
It's a hell of a lot of boat
for the money. It's got radar,

01:03:45.997 --> 01:03:50.166
GPS, autopilot, auto-furling.
You can take this baby out
by yourself.

01:03:51.252 --> 01:03:53.211
This has even got
a cellular phone.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.130
You can call your wife
if you want to.

01:03:57.216 --> 01:03:59.009
So, what do you think?

01:04:00.011 --> 01:04:02.178
"Deja Vu. "

01:04:05.016 --> 01:04:06.975
She's perfect.

01:05:51.328 --> 01:05:52.912
Yes?
Jackal.

01:05:52.996 --> 01:05:54.580
They know about Hayslip.

01:05:54.665 --> 01:05:58.960
They know you were in Canada,
and they have an Irishman
helping them.

01:05:59.253 --> 01:06:00.294
Irishman's name?

01:06:00.379 --> 01:06:01.879
Mulqueen.

01:06:03.674 --> 01:06:04.799
Declan Mulqueen?

01:06:04.883 --> 01:06:06.634
Declan Mulqueen.

01:06:09.638 --> 01:06:11.681
The operation's still a go.

01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:15.893
Declan.

01:06:15.978 --> 01:06:20.106
Every crossing point and
airport has his photograph,
but RCMP has nothing.

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:23.484
On our side,
the Border Patrol, the INS
are both on the highest alert.

01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:25.111
Again, nothing.

01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:27.029
I mean, let's face it,
you don't have to be Houdini

01:06:27.114 --> 01:06:28.740
to make it across
from Canada.

01:06:28.824 --> 01:06:30.408
He probably
walked across,
for Christ's sake.

01:06:30.492 --> 01:06:32.827
He won't be walking,
I can tell you that.

01:06:33.203 --> 01:06:34.996
He's got a weapon to move.

01:06:35.164 --> 01:06:36.914
What kind of security patrols
do you have on these?

01:06:36.999 --> 01:06:40.209
The Great Lakes?
Not a lot. No need.

01:06:40.419 --> 01:06:42.336
People either drive or fly.

01:06:42.504 --> 01:06:44.297
There are a few
ferry services,

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.257
but we checked
those out as well.

01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:48.634
What about people
with boats?

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:50.803
What kind of
immigration controls
do you have?

01:06:50.888 --> 01:06:53.097
Arriving vessels
have to check
with the harbormaster.

01:06:53.182 --> 01:06:54.931
Mmm. Voluntarily?

01:06:55.016 --> 01:06:57.517
Yeah.
No active enforcement.

01:06:57.685 --> 01:07:00.103
All right.

01:07:00.188 --> 01:07:03.648
Say he does use a boat,
he'll still want to
mix with others.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.859
Are there many gatherings
to speak of?

01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:09.279
Yeah, the Mackinaw Regatta
is going on now.

01:07:09.363 --> 01:07:11.531
It's the biggest regatta
on Lake Michigan.

01:07:11.616 --> 01:07:12.824
From where to where?

01:07:12.909 --> 01:07:16.328
It starts in Mackinaw
and it ends in Chicago.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:27.857
Witherspoon,
take Waveland.

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.568
Declan, Valentina,
Chicago Yacht Club.

01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:32.903
I'll take the locals.
And remember,

01:08:32.988 --> 01:08:34.988
it'll be an Ontario
registered boat
if it's here,

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:37.323
so look at everything
and stay on your radios.

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:39.201
If you do find something,
call in backup.

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:41.078
I want an arrest,
not a fire fight.

01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:49.295
All right,
let's get to it.

01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:54.508
Preston, what about
letting me have a gun?

01:08:55.051 --> 01:08:56.510
Are you crazy?

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:59.220
If the right people knew
I was letting you walk
around without cuffs,

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:00.930
I'd get forced retirement.

01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:05.560
No fucking gun.

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:11.399
So many people.

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:13.068
So many rich people.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.278
Shall we dance?

01:09:16.322 --> 01:09:18.323
He wouldn't give me a gun.

01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:15.630
He is hot.

01:10:17.466 --> 01:10:19.550
He's mine.
Back off.

01:10:23.888 --> 01:10:25.806
Hey, you want
some champagne?

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.307
Come on. Join us.

01:10:27.392 --> 01:10:28.600
Maybe later.

01:10:28.726 --> 01:10:29.977
Join us.

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:18.417
Declan!

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.867
Get out of the way!

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.351
Preston,
can I talk to you?

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:25.024
Look, he saw me.
He wasn't surprised.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:26.818
Like he was expecting me.

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.444
One of your team
is playing
for the other side.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.489
Impossible. I can vouch
for every man on this team.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:32.657
I'm telling you,
you've got a traitor.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.200
This is not the IRA.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:35.451
We don't get
infiltrators.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.786
Somebody got to him.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:40.665
Look, this is a manhunt,
not your cause.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.250
Don't make it personal.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.419
What do you fucking know?

01:13:54.804 --> 01:13:56.388
I'll tell you
what I know.

01:13:56.472 --> 01:13:59.224
I know the Jackal
set you up in that
arms deal in Libya.

01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:03.270
I know Isabella
was wounded when you
walked into the trap.

01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:06.899
I also know that it was
the business you had chosen.

01:14:06.983 --> 01:14:10.319
Did you also know that
Isabella was pregnant
when she got shot?

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:12.613
That our child
didn't survive?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.078
Don't tell me it's not
personal, Mr. Preston.

01:14:22.415 --> 01:14:25.500
I can't let you
jeopardize us
in a vendetta.

01:14:25.793 --> 01:14:27.461
There's no vendetta.

01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:31.298
All I hope for
is a fresh start,
you know?

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:39.681
Maybe it'll happen.

01:16:09.771 --> 01:16:12.272
This was recorded
at 1:00 a.m. this morning.

01:16:12.356 --> 01:16:15.734
It's a call to a number
in Brighton Beach, New York.

01:16:17.278 --> 01:16:18.486
Item four.

01:16:18.571 --> 01:16:22.490
At 1:05 p.m., Director Brown
is scheduled to meet
the First Lady

01:16:22.575 --> 01:16:24.659
at a diplomatic reception
at the White House

01:16:24.744 --> 01:16:27.329
regarding the New Hope
Hospital opening.

01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:29.748
Other participants
will be decided...

01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:34.169
That information
came out of this room.

01:16:37.089 --> 01:16:39.591
Who? Whose voice is it
on that tape?

01:16:46.974 --> 01:16:48.433
Mine.

01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:53.855
Mr. Ambassador,

01:16:54.732 --> 01:16:57.400
we have arranged
to hold a 9:00 p.m.
Aeroflot flight to Moscow.

01:16:57.485 --> 01:17:00.403
A car is waiting to drive
Colonel Bolitonov
to the airport.

01:17:17.797 --> 01:17:19.922
How did you know
whose phone to tap?

01:17:20.131 --> 01:17:23.967
I didn't,
so I tapped everybody's.

01:17:24.928 --> 01:17:28.013
But I have
diplomatic immunity.

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:30.849
Who authorized you
to tap my telephone?

01:17:31.226 --> 01:17:32.726
I did, Ambassador.

01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:34.311
We're currently
examining documents

01:17:34.396 --> 01:17:36.814
taken from Director
Bolitonov's apartment.

01:17:52.997 --> 01:17:54.915
Get me a helicopter.

01:18:22.235 --> 01:18:23.694
Jackal.

01:18:24.195 --> 01:18:28.198
Director Bolitonov
is no longer contactable
at this number.

01:18:28.283 --> 01:18:30.658
All inquiries should be
forwarded to...

01:18:36.415 --> 01:18:38.708
This is only a precaution
for a short while,

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:40.126
until we get this man.

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:42.628
You and your family will be
safer in Washington.

01:18:42.754 --> 01:18:45.131
You don't
really think you'll find him,
because you won't.

01:18:45.215 --> 01:18:46.507
Believe me, you can't.

01:18:46.592 --> 01:18:48.217
It's our job to try.

01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:51.721
And waste your time
and maybe get killed
for nothing?

01:18:53.515 --> 01:18:55.391
I began this.

01:18:56.059 --> 01:19:00.188
I have to do what I can,
so please
get your family away.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:07.820
Let's go.

01:19:13.076 --> 01:19:14.243
Okay.

01:19:24.546 --> 01:19:25.546
Everything okay?

01:19:25.631 --> 01:19:28.049
Valentina's evacuating
Isabella and her family

01:19:28.133 --> 01:19:31.052
in case the Jackal knows
where she lives.

01:19:33.096 --> 01:19:36.432
Look, the director
doesn't even know
where Isabella lives.

01:19:36.558 --> 01:19:38.476
I ordered Witherspoon
to keep her
out of the report.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.976
No way Jackal knows.

01:19:40.853 --> 01:19:44.856
Well, our Russian black-heart
surely passed everything else
to him, didn't he?

01:19:45.191 --> 01:19:46.525
Here, look.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.780
That's your phone number.
That's Valentina's.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:54.199
You know those two
at the bottom?

01:19:57.995 --> 01:19:59.996
The first one's
the Russian Embassy.

01:20:01.749 --> 01:20:03.667
The second one's...

01:20:06.128 --> 01:20:07.379
Son of a bitch.

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.297
What?

01:20:10.299 --> 01:20:12.592
This is an FBI access code.

01:20:18.516 --> 01:20:19.558
FBI Data Center.

01:20:19.642 --> 01:20:21.560
This is Special Agent
Carter Preston.

01:20:21.644 --> 01:20:25.564
My authorization number
is 223578-Kilo.
Shit!

01:20:25.648 --> 01:20:27.732
I need a voice
transcription
of field report

01:20:27.817 --> 01:20:30.318
November Alpha
from 9-1 5 this year.

01:20:30.403 --> 01:20:34.239
Agent filing,
Witherspoon, Timothy I.
And I'm in a hurry, operator.

01:20:38.828 --> 01:20:40.829
I shouldn't have trusted you.

01:20:43.499 --> 01:20:47.544
Field report November Alpha
filed 0900 hours...

01:20:47.628 --> 01:20:48.752
Scroll.

01:20:48.837 --> 01:20:51.755
To perform interview
of subject Isabella Zancona

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.923
at the following address...
Shit.

01:20:53.008 --> 01:20:55.384
Witherspoon,
you by-the-book asshole!

01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:56.468
Shit!

01:21:13.528 --> 01:21:15.404
I'm gonna check upstairs.

01:21:15.655 --> 01:21:17.317
Witherspoon?

01:22:10.751 --> 01:22:11.918
Come out!

01:22:13.087 --> 01:22:14.754
Please don't shoot me.

01:22:16.256 --> 01:22:18.216
Just taking out
the garbage.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.385
I got one more trip.

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:21.511
Hurry.

01:22:21.595 --> 01:22:22.804
We'll meet you
at the front.

01:22:22.888 --> 01:22:23.930
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:33.107 --> 01:22:36.442
All locked up.
Where's Witherspoon?

01:22:36.527 --> 01:22:38.569
He's in the backyard,
taking out the trash.

01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:44.117
It's coming from the back.
Let's go!

01:22:59.133 --> 01:23:00.133
Where is it coming from?

01:23:00.551 --> 01:23:01.634
I don't know.

01:23:27.493 --> 01:23:29.786
Set to go off
two minutes ago.

01:23:30.997 --> 01:23:32.497
What the hell?

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.376
Where's McMurphy?

01:25:36.954 --> 01:25:40.790
Press here, hard.
It'll slow the bleeding.

01:25:54.388 --> 01:25:56.723
See, that's bad.

01:25:57.016 --> 01:26:00.476
Blood's almost black.
That means the bullet's
in your liver.

01:26:00.686 --> 01:26:02.520
You got about
20 minutes to live.

01:26:04.023 --> 01:26:07.609
If the pain gets too much,
you can take your hand away

01:26:07.693 --> 01:26:10.987
and you'll be dead
in five minutes.

01:26:16.535 --> 01:26:20.705
When Declan kills you,
you think of me, okay?

01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:25.335
Okay.

01:26:26.545 --> 01:26:28.171
I'll make a note of that.

01:26:30.507 --> 01:26:33.801
If you see Declan
before you die,

01:26:33.886 --> 01:26:37.012
you tell him that
he can't protect his women.

01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:06.500
They're all right.
Let them through.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.713
Valentina?

01:27:16.678 --> 01:27:18.345
You'll be fine.
Huh?

01:27:18.429 --> 01:27:19.721
Yeah.
Hi.

01:27:19.806 --> 01:27:21.223
Yeah.
Declan...

01:27:28.398 --> 01:27:31.108
It's all right, darling.
You're gonna be fine.

01:27:31.359 --> 01:27:34.152
I tried

01:27:34.237 --> 01:27:36.321
to protect Isabella.

01:27:36.406 --> 01:27:38.824
Oh, I know, I know.
You did fine.

01:27:40.034 --> 01:27:42.828
He said to tell you,

01:27:43.413 --> 01:27:48.916
say, "You can't
protect your women."

01:27:52.587 --> 01:27:53.879
Valentina.

01:27:55.215 --> 01:27:59.260
Oh. No, Valentina.
No, don't. Valentina!

01:27:59.553 --> 01:28:02.304
Don't go. Stay.
Stay with me.

01:28:09.855 --> 01:28:11.105
Oh, Declan.

01:28:58.444 --> 01:29:00.487
Oh, Declan,
it was him, wasn't it?

01:29:01.989 --> 01:29:04.240
I thought this was
all behind us.

01:29:06.118 --> 01:29:08.453
Is this ever gonna end?

01:29:09.622 --> 01:29:13.208
Yes. I promise you,
it will end,

01:29:17.338 --> 01:29:18.922
and I will end it.

01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:26.054
Do you have a gun?

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.533
Following a low-light
helicopter insertion

01:29:46.659 --> 01:29:49.119
a team could infiltrate
the weapon to a point here,

01:29:49.203 --> 01:29:52.163
covering the northern
approaches and Route One.

01:29:52.248 --> 01:29:56.334
If your weapon has nearly
the range and cyclic rate
you're advertising,

01:29:56.418 --> 01:29:59.587
it could engage any
ground vehicle and aircraft
approaching the base.

01:29:59.672 --> 01:30:04.300
He doesn't have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up.

01:30:04.384 --> 01:30:05.717
He's alone.

01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:08.387
What do you say, Mulqueen?

01:30:08.471 --> 01:30:12.432
Well, the only way
he can make the kill and
escape is from a distance.

01:30:14.394 --> 01:30:17.229
So we make sure you're
always secure indoors

01:30:17.397 --> 01:30:20.190
with a perimeter of men
outside your location.

01:30:20.275 --> 01:30:21.525
And pick our battles?

01:30:21.609 --> 01:30:22.860
Exactly.

01:30:24.112 --> 01:30:26.280
Tying a noose,
if you like.

01:30:26.906 --> 01:30:28.490
When he makes his move,

01:30:28.575 --> 01:30:30.701
we tighten the noose
and we hang him.

01:30:31.911 --> 01:30:34.955
Not exactly foolproof,
I know, but it's
the best we got.

01:30:35.248 --> 01:30:37.374
The best we've got?

01:30:43.798 --> 01:30:45.340
You have a call on line six.

01:30:45.425 --> 01:30:46.633
Thank you.

01:30:49.137 --> 01:30:50.345
This is Doug.

01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:51.889
Told you I'd call.

01:30:52.307 --> 01:30:54.308
Oh, hi.
How are you?

01:30:54.392 --> 01:30:57.102
You've just got
to have a little faith
in people, Douglas.

01:30:59.272 --> 01:31:03.025
Okay. Well, okay.
Now that I've got faith,
are you busy tonight?

01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:04.818
Are you here?
You're in town, yes?

01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:25.046
...feels like temperatures
are gonna be...

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:26.881
Hello?

01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:29.383
...next couple of days.
No rain expected
right now.

01:31:29.468 --> 01:31:31.010
I'm home.

01:31:31.303 --> 01:31:35.056
We are looking at the system
that's moving into our area
later on tonight...

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.849
I see you found the keys.

01:31:37.976 --> 01:31:39.435
Where are you?

01:31:40.145 --> 01:31:41.604
In the garage!

01:31:53.158 --> 01:31:54.867
Wow. You dyed your hair.

01:31:55.869 --> 01:31:57.119
Yeah.

01:31:57.287 --> 01:31:58.329
Like it?

01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:02.667
Yeah, sure.

01:32:07.339 --> 01:32:09.006
You like Korean food?

01:32:10.133 --> 01:32:11.759
Uh, sure. Yeah.

01:32:13.178 --> 01:32:14.345
Dig in.

01:32:18.392 --> 01:32:20.309
I thought we were gonna...

01:32:21.478 --> 01:32:23.187
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:26.857 --> 01:32:28.483
I thought we were
gonna go out.

01:32:29.068 --> 01:32:31.361
Yeah. Maybe later.

01:32:32.822 --> 01:32:35.615
- Thank you, Michael.
- Great weather report.

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.659
Recapping tonight's top story,

01:32:37.743 --> 01:32:40.662
police are asking
for your help
in locating this man.

01:32:40.746 --> 01:32:44.124
He's wanted in several states
in connection with a series
of brutal murders,

01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:46.835
but police believe he's in
the Washington area tonight.

01:32:46.919 --> 01:32:49.129
The man is thought to be armed
and extremely dangerous.

01:32:49.213 --> 01:32:51.381
If you see him, police warn
not to approach him,

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:53.800
but to notify
authorities immediately.

01:32:54.677 --> 01:32:56.511
Temperatures around
the area, like we said,

01:32:56.595 --> 01:32:58.722
here at National Airport
in the District, 89 degrees.

01:33:01.559 --> 01:33:03.184
If you're looking for some
of the cooler temperatures,

01:33:03.269 --> 01:33:04.853
head on out
to the mountains...

01:34:01.951 --> 01:34:03.869
You know,
when I first moved here,

01:34:03.953 --> 01:34:07.456
I realized I was living
in someone else's house

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.791
and that's a huge burden.

01:34:08.875 --> 01:34:12.169
You're invited to live
in the White House
for four years...

01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:14.380
So you feel
like a renter in a sense?

01:34:14.464 --> 01:34:17.716
Most definitely.
With a lease
that's renewable or...

01:34:17.967 --> 01:34:22.221
John F. Kennedy said once
that if somebody wanted
to kill a public official,

01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:25.557
they can get away with it
as long as they're willing
to pay the price.

01:34:25.642 --> 01:34:29.228
It's impossible to provide
100 percent safety.
Would you agree?

01:34:29.312 --> 01:34:32.439
Certainly.
I mean, there is
no way around that,

01:34:32.524 --> 01:34:36.235
but hopefully there aren't
that many people
who are willing to do that.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.362
Preston!

01:34:38.446 --> 01:34:40.155
Declan, what?

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.240
Do you remember
Valentina said,

01:34:41.324 --> 01:34:43.950
"A statement,
public and brutal."

01:34:44.076 --> 01:34:46.828
Now, it always bothered me.
Why did he keep coming

01:34:46.912 --> 01:34:48.746
when he knew we could
protect the director,

01:34:48.831 --> 01:34:50.415
especially once
I got involved.

01:34:50.499 --> 01:34:52.583
But he didn't abort. Why?

01:34:52.668 --> 01:34:56.087
It didn't come together
until I remembered
what he said to Valentina.

01:34:56.171 --> 01:34:58.798
"Tell Declan he can't
protect his women."

01:34:58.966 --> 01:35:00.633
Wasn't he referring
to Isabella?

01:35:00.717 --> 01:35:02.677
No. Any woman. All women.

01:35:02.761 --> 01:35:06.013
But remember,
"Public and brutal."

01:35:06.682 --> 01:35:07.807
We're guarding
the wrong person.

01:35:08.684 --> 01:35:09.934
He's after the First Lady.

01:36:08.576 --> 01:36:11.828
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

01:36:11.913 --> 01:36:14.748
I'm sure you're as happy
as I am to be here today.

01:36:14.832 --> 01:36:17.626
It's been a lot of hard work
for a lot of us

01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:20.962
but here we are,
and we're about to celebrate.

01:36:21.047 --> 01:36:23.673
And now it gives me
great pleasure to introduce

01:36:23.758 --> 01:36:26.927
the Surgeon General
of the United States.

01:36:31.557 --> 01:36:34.392
Madam Chairperson,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:35.269 --> 01:36:38.313
I'd like to chat
with you today
about the family.

01:37:00.461 --> 01:37:02.044
She's already on the dais.

01:37:02.128 --> 01:37:04.129
Secret Service wants to know
what's going on.

01:37:04.214 --> 01:37:05.214
Tell them.

01:37:05.298 --> 01:37:07.299
No! No, they'll try
to get her off the dais.

01:37:07.384 --> 01:37:10.219
If they do that,
he'll shoot off
into the crowd.

01:37:21.648 --> 01:37:24.358
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal,

01:37:24.442 --> 01:37:27.987
and I must say that we
certainly have accomplished
what we set out to do

01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:29.905
since we first began

01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:31.699
with a seed of an idea.

01:37:31.783 --> 01:37:34.743
It took many
long and hard hours to...

01:37:45.839 --> 01:37:47.214
Get the word?

01:37:47.299 --> 01:37:51.427
Looking for a dark brown
minivan and anything else
that's out of its place.

01:37:51.511 --> 01:37:54.096
The only minivan we found
is this red one here.

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.681
I checked it out
about 1 5 minutes ago.

01:37:55.765 --> 01:37:58.767
They got a local
parking permit, DC tags.

01:37:58.852 --> 01:38:00.394
We can check it out again,
if you want.

01:38:00.478 --> 01:38:03.772
Nah. It's probably
one of those safer-than-sorry,
circle-jerk type deals.

01:38:03.857 --> 01:38:04.940
Yeah.

01:38:05.025 --> 01:38:06.358
I'll see you.

01:38:06.443 --> 01:38:08.027
You guys be safe.

01:38:25.502 --> 01:38:28.630
Secret Service says
the search came out negative.

01:38:28.714 --> 01:38:31.466
They're on alert,
but she's going to the podium.

01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:32.967
Guess it's on us.

01:38:38.349 --> 01:38:39.807
You'll need a gun.

01:38:50.694 --> 01:38:52.236
Forget the laser.

01:38:52.321 --> 01:38:54.489
You'll have to walk me
through the optics
on this thing.

01:38:54.573 --> 01:38:56.366
I haven't shot a gun
in a while.

01:39:04.541 --> 01:39:07.835
I can see by the warm and
friendly faces out there

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.381
that this christening
has been long anticipated.

01:39:11.924 --> 01:39:15.927
Thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible.

01:39:16.595 --> 01:39:19.806
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal

01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:23.934
and I must say that
we certainly have accomplished
what we set out to do.

01:39:30.692 --> 01:39:35.112
It's proof that when we
set out to reach new heights,
it can be done.

01:40:12.483 --> 01:40:14.505
Go! Clear!

01:40:32.836 --> 01:40:34.462
I'm going
for the First Lady.

01:40:34.546 --> 01:40:37.381
You're cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter.

01:40:42.262 --> 01:40:44.930
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

01:40:45.015 --> 01:40:48.434
to introduce the First Lady
of the United States.

01:40:55.984 --> 01:40:59.361
It's a beautiful day
for the beginning of New Hope.

01:41:02.783 --> 01:41:04.825
All right.
Go, go, go!

01:41:54.458 --> 01:41:55.750
Give me the gun.

01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:16.187
So that's how
he plans to get out.

01:42:16.272 --> 01:42:18.523
The phone,
give me your phone.

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:41.087
But also right now
there are police officers
risking their very lives

01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:44.507
to help kids stay out
of trouble and off drugs.

01:42:50.722 --> 01:42:51.722
He's clear.

01:42:58.897 --> 01:43:01.481
But also right now,
there are dedicated teachers

01:43:01.566 --> 01:43:04.735
preparing lessons
for a new day's class.

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:09.781
Red minivan,
hillside by the trees.

01:43:09.866 --> 01:43:10.991
One o'clock.

01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:13.493
Jesus.

01:43:13.578 --> 01:43:14.745
Range it.

01:43:15.914 --> 01:43:18.790
750, 762 meters.

01:43:22.045 --> 01:43:24.588
...but values his family.

01:44:03.835 --> 01:44:06.212
Right. I'm after him.
You take out the minivan.

01:44:46.586 --> 01:44:48.796
Move it! Go, go, go!

01:45:40.556 --> 01:45:41.598
Coming through!

01:45:41.682 --> 01:45:42.682
Hey!

01:46:03.829 --> 01:46:05.580
Look out!
Coming through!

01:46:11.879 --> 01:46:14.255
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, man!

01:47:09.352 --> 01:47:13.438
Now arriving, the inbound
train from Turnbull Station.

01:47:13.523 --> 01:47:15.941
Please stand clear
of the doors.

01:47:46.346 --> 01:47:48.055
No!

01:47:58.275 --> 01:47:59.817
Shite!

01:48:01.778 --> 01:48:04.864
The next train
departing Capitol Heights...

01:48:07.534 --> 01:48:08.534
Come on!

01:48:13.415 --> 01:48:14.749
Yeah, Capitol Heights.

01:48:24.051 --> 01:48:25.051
Shit.

01:50:25.086 --> 01:50:26.086
Hey!

01:50:33.386 --> 01:50:34.970
Shut up!

01:50:37.265 --> 01:50:39.350
Get out!
Get out of here! Now!

01:50:42.604 --> 01:50:44.813
Run!
Oh, my God!
Don't stop! Keep going!

01:50:44.898 --> 01:50:46.440
Give me your hand!

01:51:13.801 --> 01:51:15.968
Help me, please!

01:51:22.476 --> 01:51:24.185
Help me!

01:51:26.688 --> 01:51:28.272
Say, "Help me, Declan."

01:51:28.357 --> 01:51:30.483
Help me, Declan.
Help me, Declan.

01:51:30.567 --> 01:51:32.777
Help me, Declan!

01:51:37.574 --> 01:51:39.450
Please help!

01:51:41.954 --> 01:51:44.205
Please, Declan, help me!

01:51:46.625 --> 01:51:49.544
Please help me!
Help!

01:51:50.921 --> 01:51:52.505
Declan!

01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.969
Louder!
Help me, Declan!

01:51:58.053 --> 01:52:00.138
Help me, Declan!

01:52:01.515 --> 01:52:04.434
Now tell me where
the man with the gun is.

01:52:05.184 --> 01:52:06.226
Around the corner.

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:08.812
Good girl,
good girl, good girl.

01:52:11.774 --> 01:52:14.025
What are you gonna do,
Declan?

01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:17.028
You just can't
seem to protect
any of your women.

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.948
Let her go.
She has nothing
to do with this.

01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:22.492
Now, you can
save this girl.

01:52:22.577 --> 01:52:23.743
What's your name?

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:27.080
Maggie.
Maggie. You can
save Maggie, you see?

01:52:27.165 --> 01:52:29.082
You can save her
right now.

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:32.294
You just have
to put down
your little gun.

01:52:35.089 --> 01:52:36.339
Okay?

01:52:40.595 --> 01:52:41.845
Declan!

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.725
No!

01:52:51.314 --> 01:52:53.899
Go ahead.
Take the shot.

01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:02.908
Oh, Maggie,
you did so good.
You did so good.

01:53:07.663 --> 01:53:09.789
You're slipping, Declan.

01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:16.962
Now let her go.

01:53:18.089 --> 01:53:19.924
Step away from the gun.

01:53:21.092 --> 01:53:23.302
Step away from the gun!

01:53:23.386 --> 01:53:25.679
Ah, Maggie, Maggie.

01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:27.473
You're so brave.

01:53:27.557 --> 01:53:30.309
You'll remember this
for the rest of your life.

01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:38.859
Kneel down.

01:53:43.198 --> 01:53:44.949
Kneel down.

01:54:09.266 --> 01:54:11.141
Sorry, Declan.

01:55:35.892 --> 01:55:38.393
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:55:38.895 --> 01:55:40.479
It's okay.

01:55:46.277 --> 01:55:48.153
It's finished.

01:56:34.450 --> 01:56:36.993
I wonder
if we'll ever know

01:56:37.078 --> 01:56:39.705
who the hell
he really was.

01:56:40.998 --> 01:56:43.416
We know all
we need to.
He was evil.

01:56:44.584 --> 01:56:47.461
He's dead and he's gone.
Nothing more matters.

01:56:50.465 --> 01:56:54.093
Sorry they didn't
give you your pardon.
You'll get minimum security.

01:56:54.177 --> 01:56:55.970
It's like a country club.

01:56:56.054 --> 01:56:59.724
By the way,
Director Brown sends
his warmest thanks.

01:56:59.891 --> 01:57:02.810
Oh, that's nice.
Look forward to
playing tennis with him.

01:57:04.646 --> 01:57:06.731
Did I tell you
I'm going back
to Russia?

01:57:06.815 --> 01:57:11.402
And I'm going to stay
until Terek Murad rots
in prison or in the grave.

01:57:13.113 --> 01:57:14.822
She'd appreciate that.

01:57:15.699 --> 01:57:17.408
I think so.

01:57:17.701 --> 01:57:19.493
And Isabella?

01:57:20.954 --> 01:57:23.497
Back safe
with her family.

01:57:23.707 --> 01:57:24.790
For good.

01:57:25.834 --> 01:57:28.461
I know about
that key she gave you.

01:57:29.254 --> 01:57:32.882
I know you could
have used it to take off
any time you wanted to.

01:57:32.966 --> 01:57:36.802
You've got one of those
drop boxes, too,
like the Jackal?

01:57:39.347 --> 01:57:42.641
Did you read the paper today?
I'm quite the hero
because of you.

01:57:42.726 --> 01:57:44.602
The agent who saved
the First Lady.

01:57:46.021 --> 01:57:50.065
I could screw everything
else up for the rest
of my life and still be

01:57:50.567 --> 01:57:52.067
untouchable.

01:57:52.985 --> 01:57:54.110
That a fact, then?

01:57:55.446 --> 01:57:57.947
Going back
to the drop box,

01:57:58.282 --> 01:58:00.742
an operative with
your experience

01:58:00.826 --> 01:58:02.869
with a clean passport

01:58:02.953 --> 01:58:04.871
a wad of cash.

01:58:05.831 --> 01:58:09.083
I'll bet
if you had taken off

01:58:12.087 --> 01:58:14.214
we never would
have found you.

01:58:17.843 --> 01:58:19.385
Do you drink coffee?

01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:22.555
Oh, no, that's right.
They drink Guinness
in Ireland.

01:58:23.557 --> 01:58:27.018
I'll ask across the street.
See if they've got any.

01:58:27.353 --> 01:58:29.020
Coffee, I mean.

01:58:29.104 --> 01:58:30.855
I'll be back in

01:58:31.816 --> 01:58:34.651
30 minutes, okay?

01:58:40.783 --> 01:58:43.117
Thanks, Declan,
for everything.

01:58:44.078 --> 01:58:45.954
No, thank you, Da.
