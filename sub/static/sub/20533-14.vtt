00:01.752 --> 00:02.753
Previously on...

00:02.795 --> 00:04.129
Adrianna was so worried
this morning,

00:04.171 --> 00:05.506
when she saw Vanessa,
she told me everything.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.175
Stop pretending you
don't know she's back.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.718
You were on your way
to meet her.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.428
I can't let you do that.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.972
You'll be traveling in this.

00:13.012 --> 00:13.848
You're going to put me in a box?

00:13.889 --> 00:14.974
If you won't let me
protect you,

00:15.015 --> 00:16.934
you leave me no other choice.

00:16.976 --> 00:17.893
How long have you been
staying in L.A.?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.102
I'm just here for a
job interview.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.729
So, you're moving here.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.272
I don't know if it's
going to pan out.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.858
I mean, I got to meet you.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.234
And take away your only chance
to have a baby.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.903
Mr. Montgomery stipulated
you hire a third party

00:27.945 --> 00:29.112
to carry the child.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.198
There is one other candidate.
Shane has a sister.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.075
You have to be
so incredibly brave

00:34.117 --> 00:36.370
to trust somebody you just
met to carry your baby.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.206
I'd really like the chance
to be that person.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.124
Hey, Silver.
Hey.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.170
I will do whatever it takes
to get out of your contract

00:45.212 --> 00:48.089
and out of your life.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.968
I was going to release you

00:51.010 --> 00:52.803
so you could work with him
without me.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.389
I'm done. Okay?
You're released.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.905
Yo.
Yo.

01:12.531 --> 01:15.409
Is there a reason why you're
taking apart my sink?

01:15.450 --> 01:18.245
Annie invested 200 grand into
my record label,

01:18.286 --> 01:20.706
and I spent it all on
startup costs.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.166
But then I dropped Ade,
which means I have no artist,

01:23.208 --> 01:24.752
no income,
no way to pay my sister back.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.253
Since Annie's living here,

01:26.294 --> 01:28.463
I figured I'd fix the sink
so she doesn't think

01:28.505 --> 01:30.257
of her brother as some
great, big loser.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.300
Wouldn't it be easier just to
sign a new artist?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.386
No established artist wants
to sign with me right now.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.722
And all the big labels
are taking all the new ones.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.139
So, basically, I'm screwed.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.224
Can I help?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.601
Can you sing?

01:40.642 --> 01:42.352
I meant with the sink.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.564
Yeah, apparently record labels
aren't the only thing

01:45.606 --> 01:46.815
I can't figure out. (chuckles)

01:46.857 --> 01:49.150
Hand me that wrench.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.485
Here.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.113
And, uh... here.
What are...

01:53.154 --> 01:54.573
This doesn't even...

01:54.615 --> 01:56.283
Whoa-oh.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.452
Is this a subpoena?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.578
Yeah, it's no big deal.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.121
I've got to go to court tomorrow

02:01.162 --> 02:02.539
to testify at Ashley's
preliminary hearing.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.625
You're testifying against
the lady that kidnapped you?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.501
That's kind of heavy.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.628
Are you okay?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.420
(sighs) I'm fine.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.131
Once I testify,
this whole thing will be over,

02:11.172 --> 02:13.550
I never have to think about
the kidnapping again,

02:13.592 --> 02:15.427
and my life can get finally
get back to normal.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.513
Done.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.474
Well, if you need a ride down
to the courthouse,

02:20.515 --> 02:22.225
I'm your man.
I have nothing but time.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.477
Nah, I'm actually good.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.645
I'm going to go with Adrianna.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.396
She's got to be down there
anyway for her...

02:26.438 --> 02:28.732
wardrobe malfunction.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.609
Yeah,
tell her to plead insanity.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.693
(wry laugh)

02:33.737 --> 02:34.905
(sighs)

02:39.200 --> 02:41.745
Thank you for letting me go
through your closet, Silver.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.538
I can't believe that they're
charging me

02:43.580 --> 02:45.373
with indecent exposure.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.208
I need something to wear in
court that screams

02:47.250 --> 02:48.627
"I'm not a sex criminal."

02:48.669 --> 02:52.380
All of my non-slutty clothes are
probably on the left-hand side.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.590
I knew flashing a stadium
full of people

02:53.632 --> 02:55.258
at a charity event would
impact my career,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.511
but I had no idea it was going
to become my trademark.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.888
I haven't been able to book a
gig since it happened.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.264
And every time I talk to
someone,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.350
I feel like they're imagining me
with my shirt off.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.643
I'm sorry,
I really would love to talk

03:04.685 --> 03:06.103
but I have to bolt.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.186
I'm supposed to pick up Michaela
in, like, five minutes,

03:07.228 --> 03:08.396
and show her around C.U.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.565
Michaela?

03:10.607 --> 03:11.566
Oh, your surrogate.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.069
And Shane's sister.
Weird, I know.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.654
Teddy and I are splitting
the living costs,

03:15.696 --> 03:16.697
but I have to oversee everything
else:

03:16.738 --> 03:18.157
her doctor's appointments,
her housing,

03:18.197 --> 03:19.407
her diet, her exercise.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.201
It's super overwhelming,
and I can't talk right now.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.704
But help yourself to anything
in the closet

03:23.745 --> 03:25.372
and we'll totally catch up
later.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.624
(door closes)

03:31.545 --> 03:32.963
Shirazi.

03:33.005 --> 03:36.133
Dude, finals week sucks.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.760
All of our extracurricular
activities are on hold,

03:38.802 --> 03:41.388
so I don't get to watch your
buddy Liam pound anybody.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.347
(chuckle)

03:42.389 --> 03:43.765
You going to Finals Frolic
tomorrow?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.808
There's going to be
plenty of women,

03:44.850 --> 03:45.809
Battle of the Bands.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.435
Yeah, maybe.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.312
I just have to get through this
exam first.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.397
Oh, please, God.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.816
Don't sweat it,
you're gonna do fine.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.484
Yeah, I wish I had your
confidence.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.652
Calculus is not my best subject.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.863
Navid, you are a member of
the Cronus Society.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.115
Everything is our best subject.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.534
Just don't forget to leave
your phone on, all right?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.369
Why?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.414
In case I have to call with more
party info or something.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.624
See ya, bud.
See ya.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.543
So this is C.U.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.294
Teddy said you were a semester
away from graduating,

04:13.336 --> 04:14.755
so I figured we could sign
you up with some classes.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.964
Obviously nothing too crazy,

04:16.005 --> 04:17.091
because I don't think
an all-nighter would

04:17.132 --> 04:18.382
be good for the baby.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.677
Actually, school's kind of
more my family's thing.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.679
That's why I was so excited
to get this job.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.473
I get to move to L.A.,
meet a bunch of cool people.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.892
Yeah, meet a bunch of
cool people, that will happen.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.186
Maybe while you're
pregnant though,

04:29.228 --> 04:30.771
you'll want
to learn something. Right?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
Navid.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.400
This is Michaela,
remember?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.152
Oh, yeah.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.445
We met at, uh, Dixon's place.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.571
Yeah.
How's it going?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.697
It's great.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.533
I'm going to go grab
a course book.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.492
Just in case.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.786
I'll be right back.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.998
Hey, look, thanks for not
saying anything,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.959
about us hooking up
the other night.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.376
Yeah, I figured
it's not the impression

04:53.418 --> 04:54.669
you wanted to make during
your interview.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.588
(chuckling):
No, definitely not.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.506
Plus, if it got back
to Teddy and Shane,

04:58.548 --> 04:59.925
my whole family would start
freaking out

04:59.967 --> 05:02.803
that I wasn't being like
responsible Michaela.
Yeah.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.721
Even though we were totally
responsible.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.847
Twice.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.390
It's cool. I get it.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.811
Uh. besides, Silver and I
have a complicated past,

05:10.852 --> 05:12.646
and telling her I slept
with her surrogate

05:12.687 --> 05:14.731
might make things
a little more complicated.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.276
Found it.
Oh, thank you.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.610
Oh, there is an amazing organic
smoothie place

05:18.652 --> 05:20.528
right down the street.
I think you're going to love it.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.571
You want to come?

05:21.613 --> 05:22.739
Sounds extra super,

05:22.781 --> 05:24.324
but I've got to make it
to my calculus final.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.450
You two ladies have a great day.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.952
Yeah, good luck.
Bye.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.662
See ya.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.506
(phone buzzes)

05:57.440 --> 05:59.026
(sighs)

06:01.360 --> 06:02.487
Okay, Naomi,
I got your emergency text.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.822
It better be bigger
than a shoe sale,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.406
because I have a lot
going on right now.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.368
Annie, this is Mark Holland.
(giggles)

06:09.410 --> 06:10.704
He owns a food truck.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.956
I told him how we need his help
planning a massive party.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.582
We do?

06:14.624 --> 06:15.876
I was a little surprised, too.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.376
I appreciate you considering me,

06:17.418 --> 06:19.378
it's just, I own a taco truck.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.631
I'm still not clear
who gave you my number.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.841
Annie and I have a half-brother

06:22.883 --> 06:25.010
who was given up for adoption
before we were born.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.595
Her father seduced my mother
at a high school dance,

06:27.637 --> 06:29.556
and the rest is sordid
family history.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.725
Which you just shared
with a total stranger.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.435
And we need your help planning
a celebration

06:34.477 --> 06:36.604
to welcome him back
into our lives.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.565
Uh, no, we don't.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.983
It's time.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.651
Don't you remember what happened
the last time

06:41.693 --> 06:42.903
a half-brother came into
our lives?

06:42.944 --> 06:43.904
He stole money from your mother

06:43.945 --> 06:45.613
and almost ruined our
friendship.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.657
That was completely different;
he was an impostor.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.658
You know what?

06:48.700 --> 06:49.784
Why don't you guys
talk privately,

06:49.826 --> 06:50.869
figure out what
you want,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.496
and if it ends up
being a taco truck,

06:53.538 --> 06:54.664
give me a call.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.918
I don't know what got this
into your head,

06:57.959 --> 06:59.418
but it is a horrible idea.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.712
What makes you think you can
even find this person

07:00.754 --> 07:01.796
in the first place?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.548
Because I already did.
He's right here?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.551
Oh, hi.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.053
Why are you both looking at me?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.847
He's our half-brother?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.101
Surprise!

07:15.643 --> 07:18.479
Welcome to our family.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.111
(theme music playing)

07:38.959 --> 07:40.919
I can't believe you
would go looking

07:40.961 --> 07:43.171
for our half-brother without
talking to me first, Naomi.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.006
How could you do
something like this?

07:45.048 --> 07:46.341
I hired a P.I.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.093
You hired someone to find me?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.345
I am so sorry.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.679
My divorce from Max
left a hole in my life,

07:51.721 --> 07:53.014
one that I would usually fill by

07:53.056 --> 07:54.849
jumping in bed with the
next man I met.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.517
But I am trying to evolve.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.438
So, I need a deeply personal,
yet non-sexual relationship--

07:59.479 --> 08:03.400
like you have with Dixon--
hence, I found my brother.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.903
So, is there a job or not?

08:06.945 --> 08:09.697
No, I made that up
to bring you here.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.409
All right then, take it easy.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.868
You're leaving?

08:13.910 --> 08:16.163
You don't want to know about...
me... about your family?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.497
I already know about my family:

08:17.538 --> 08:18.957
they're the people
who raised me.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.542
The non-sexual hole
you're looking to fill

08:21.584 --> 08:22.710
really isn't my problem.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.004
Now, if you'd excuse me,

08:24.045 --> 08:25.464
I have a business to run.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.469
I can't believe
he just walked out.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.847
Like this?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.597
He's your brother, too, Annie.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.934
And his temper clearly comes
from your side of the family.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.102
(sighs)

08:42.856 --> 08:46.109
You went shopping,
you wonderful woman, you.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.448
What the heck is "spelt"?

08:51.490 --> 08:52.824
A whole grain.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.992
And, for the record,

08:54.034 --> 08:56.036
all of this food
is for Michaela only.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.121
All of it?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.539
Which reminds me,

08:59.580 --> 09:02.042
here's Michaela's first month's
rent check

09:02.083 --> 09:03.168
from me and Teddy.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.879
Look, I-I hope giving your
surrogate a room

09:05.920 --> 09:07.672
kind of makes up for the time

09:07.714 --> 09:09.924
I implied that you weren't ready
to be a mother.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.718
(sighs)

09:11.759 --> 09:13.678
You're really helping us out
giving us a good deal on rent,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.597
but, feel free to keep
apologizing.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.807
Dixon, your place is amazing.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.808
Thanks.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.768
God, look at that ocean.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.064
Hey, do you think you could
teach me how to surf?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.690
Oh, that's probably not going to
happen.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.775
I mean, the water's, like,
really polluted and, uh...

09:27.817 --> 09:29.777
those guys out there take really
big falls, so...

09:29.819 --> 09:32.322
It's pretty safe, actually.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.991
But, I wouldn't even have the
time to show you.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.076
It's crazy.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.911
Actually, I've got to make
my way down

09:37.952 --> 09:39.120
to the Offshore right now.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.122
Annie says she has a big
surprise for me.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.875
Hopefully, it's a trust fund
that I don't know about.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.668
See you guys later.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.591
I actually have a
surprise for you, too.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.260
Nothing exciting, but...

09:53.301 --> 09:54.469
some books on pregnancy!

09:54.511 --> 09:55.595
Oh...

09:55.636 --> 09:58.806
What to eat, what not to
eat, the whole thing.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.100
And I signed us up
for yoga tomorrow.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.601
Tomorrow?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.853
Yeah. Why, do you
have something going on?

10:03.895 --> 10:07.232
Oh, no, I mean, I just
thought since we

10:07.274 --> 10:09.817
spent the last few days shopping
for course materials

10:09.859 --> 10:11.152
and prenatal vitamins,

10:11.194 --> 10:13.863
maybe I could have tomorrow off?

10:13.905 --> 10:16.116
I don't really know what
you mean by off.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.242
I mean, you're having my baby.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.618
It's not like a
nine-to-five job

10:18.659 --> 10:19.702
you can just punch a clock.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.830
Right. So, yoga tomorrow then?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.791
Yes, that would be awesome.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.418
I think you're
going to love it.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.794
Yeah.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.296
Fun, fun, fun.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.173
Oh. Psst!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.883
Campbell, hey. Dude.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.051
Hey, what's up?

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
Hey, uh, are you
out of your mind?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.930
Why did you text me
those answers yesterday?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.432
I was doing fine on that test.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.476
Navid, it's no big deal,
all right?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.018
It's just a little
something we do for

10:44.060 --> 10:45.895
for our Cronus Society members
to keep our grades up.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.606
Besides, you didn't have
to use the answers

10:47.688 --> 10:48.731
if you didn't want to.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.775
Yeah, uh,
(quietly): I couldn't help it.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.527
Okay, once I saw them scrolling
across my phone,

10:52.569 --> 10:53.945
I couldn't get them out
of my head.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.573
Great, so you did
a little better

10:56.615 --> 10:57.865
than you would have otherwise.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.784
Nobody got hurt.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.952
Now you can return the favor.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.745
Favor?
Yeah.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.997
What-what do you mean?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.915
Our physics final is coming up.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.708
You've aced every test
this semester.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.043
So, once you figure out
the answers

11:09.085 --> 11:11.087
just text them to the rest
of the guys.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.213
Yeah, uh...

11:12.255 --> 11:13.798
I-I can't do that.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.634
Accepting help for something
I didn't ask for was one thing,

11:15.674 --> 11:16.801
but people get kicked out
of school

11:16.843 --> 11:17.760
for this kind of stuff.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.847
Hmm. Fine.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.973
Then you're out of Cronus.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.267
Are-are you serious?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.644
Yeah.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.145
And since you know about
our little arrangement,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.896
we're going to have to kill you.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.609
Dude... I'm kidding.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.444
All right,
loosen up.
Yeah, of course
you are.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.736
It's not that big of a deal.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.114
We'll just get somebody else
to do it.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.074
Really?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.700
Yeah.
All right.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.786
It takes a lot of guts to stand
up for your convictions

11:43.828 --> 11:44.996
instead of help out
your friends.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.080
I admire that.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.748
I'll see you at
the Frolic, right?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.083
Yeah, absolutely.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.794
All right,
see ya, bud.
Yeah, see ya.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.672
(sighs)

11:59.678 --> 12:01.012
I can't believe my sister

12:01.054 --> 12:03.557
took over a college Battle of
the Bands to find me clients.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.559
This officially makes me the
worst music producer in history.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.101
No, it doesn't.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.688
New artists are discovered
this way all the time.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.481
They found Justin Bieber
on the Internet.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.731
Do you know how many
dancing babies

12:12.773 --> 12:14.150
and weirdly talented cats
you got to go through

12:14.192 --> 12:15.652
just to find something
like that?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.612
This is going to be easy.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.946
As my talent coordinator,

12:18.988 --> 12:20.448
you get V.I.P. access
to all the bands.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.992
With any luck, you'll find
someone you'll want to sign,

12:23.034 --> 12:24.703
your music label will be
back in business,

12:24.743 --> 12:26.829
and you can finally stop
stressing.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.082
Start listening to demos.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.458
Annie, hi.
Have you seen Liam?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.293
I need to talk to him about
renting the Offshore

12:32.335 --> 12:33.752
to start a restaurant.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.134
This has something
to do with Mark, doesn't it?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.886
Our brother who sells food
out of a truck? No.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.096
Naomi.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.098
Okay, look, I realize
that my little stunt yesterday

12:45.139 --> 12:47.726
backfired,
so I'm turning to plan B.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.893
If Mark doesn't have time for me
in his private life,

12:48.935 --> 12:50.103
I will buy a restaurant
and be a part

12:50.144 --> 12:51.479
of his professional one.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.107
Well, in case you've forgotten,
I already have a brother.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.984
And Dixon's already under
a huge amount of pressure

12:57.026 --> 12:58.777
after losing Ade from his
record label, okay?

12:58.819 --> 13:01.197
Last time a half-brother showed
up, he completely flipped out.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.116
He doesn't need this right now,
and neither do I.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.910
Uh-huh, what about Mark?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.161
You saw how cute
and middle-class he was.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.413
He needs me in his life.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.665
Okay, you can't just take
over people's lives

13:10.707 --> 13:12.667
and fix them, Naomi.
It doesn't work.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.669
Hey, Annie, thanks
for hooking this up.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.922
Some of these bands are actually
pretty decent.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.174
If you forcing me to do
this contest

13:20.216 --> 13:21.718
brings me back into this
business,

13:21.760 --> 13:25.096
I officially owe all of my
success to my beautiful sister.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.431
(giggling)

13:26.473 --> 13:27.890
Oh.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.101
(laughs quietly)

13:30.143 --> 13:31.311
Hi, kettle, I'm pot.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.479
Nice to meet you.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.314
(scoffs)

13:36.899 --> 13:38.817
Okay, how does this sound?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.861
Your Honor, I know that I have
made some mistakes,

13:40.903 --> 13:42.863
and every since the incident,

13:42.905 --> 13:44.699
my career has a taken a huge
nosedive,

13:44.741 --> 13:46.367
but throwing the book
at me would be cruel

13:46.409 --> 13:49.370
and unusual punishment.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.748
You flashed a group of people,
you didn't rob a bank.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.249
They'll probably just give
you a warning.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.833
That'd be great.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.961
That way I could put this huge
mess behind me.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.088
I can't wait to put this
behind me either.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.007
Sooner they put Ashley away,

14:01.048 --> 14:02.300
the sooner
I can start pretending

14:02.342 --> 14:04.093
this whole kidnapping thing
never happened.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.012
Liam Court.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.472
Yeah. That's me.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
Wish me luck.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.975
ASHLEY:
Liam.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.143
Liam, thank God you're here.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.894
Everyone is so confused.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.063
They don't understand
I was trying to protect you.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.107
You have to tell them
the truth.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.443
Liam! Liam!

14:22.445 --> 14:24.905
Are you okay?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.574
Yeah, just got to get
some water.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.290
(breathing heavily)

14:38.044 --> 14:39.170
Are you sure
you're okay?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.380
(grunts)

14:42.965 --> 14:44.091
(choking)

14:44.133 --> 14:46.177
Hey, get off of her.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.514
Hey, why are you grabbing me,
she's the one who...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.684
Come on.
Ade...

15:02.068 --> 15:03.570
How's Ade?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.113
Shaken but fine.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.240
She's worried
about you.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.991
The court said
they wouldn't release me

15:09.033 --> 15:11.202
until I saw a medical
professional.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.537
Maybe they're right.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.954
Maybe I do need help.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.165
Adrianna told me
what's going on with you.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.460
The kidnapping,
your friend's shooting.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.880
Liam, have you been having
trouble sleeping?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.631
Mood swings, anxiety?

15:23.673 --> 15:24.924
No more than anyone else

15:24.965 --> 15:26.509
who almost got shipped to
Mexico in a box.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.927
Liam, I think you are suffering

15:27.968 --> 15:29.512
from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

15:29.554 --> 15:33.140
PTSD? It's not like
I went to war.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.143
Combat isn't the only cause,
but treatment's pretty standard.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.938
(sighs)
Cognitive
behavior therapy.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.357
You need to confront the things
that remind you of your trauma

15:41.399 --> 15:43.568
and deal with what happened
instead of hiding from it.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.237
So, you're saying I need to do
more of what I did today,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.405
'Cause that worked out great.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.448
Confronting your past

15:48.489 --> 15:50.116
is the only way
to start feeling better.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.411
Don't take this the wrong way,
but that sounds crazy.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.248
(sighs)

15:57.290 --> 15:59.751
Are we done here?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.487
Hello. Welcome to C.U.'s
First Annual

16:27.528 --> 16:29.656
Food Truck Competition.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.949
Wait, you work here?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.284
If by work here you mean,
created the entire contest,

16:33.326 --> 16:36.162
then yes.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.122
What are you doing?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.457
I already wasted
half my day yesterday

16:39.499 --> 16:40.750
with your fake catering job.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.085
I think I'll pass on the
pretend food contest.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.213
Oh, so I guess it doesn't matter
that Wolfgang Puck is judging?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.591
The Wolfgang Puck?

16:48.633 --> 16:49.801
Such a charming man.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.010
I mean, he single-handedly
changed the face

16:51.051 --> 16:51.970
of American cuisine.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.471
The guy's amazing.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.055
He started with nothing
and created an empire.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.141
You could do the same thing
if you win the contest.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.226
First prize is a write-up
from Wolfgang,

16:59.268 --> 17:01.270
plus a silent partner will
help you open up

17:01.312 --> 17:04.231
your own restaurant at this
amazing waterfront location.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.358
But if you
prefer selling tacos

17:06.400 --> 17:09.529
to tourists at the tar pits,
then by all means, fly free.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.991
Okay, fine, I'll
do the contest.

17:13.031 --> 17:13.950
But just so we're clear,

17:13.992 --> 17:15.117
I'm doing this to help
my business.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.368
Don't think it
means we're taking

17:16.410 --> 17:17.494
family vacations together.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.005
Adrianna.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.509
Oh, hey. Hi.

17:31.551 --> 17:35.013
Look, I just wanted to apologize
again for yesterday.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.890
It's fine.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.642
You didn't
realize it was me.
Yeah.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.519
So, did you talk to that
therapist?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.479
Yeah. But she's clueless.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.606
She keeps trying to talk me
into some kind

17:45.648 --> 17:46.524
of stupid treatment.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.067
But, Liam,
if you don't get help,

17:48.108 --> 17:50.152
how do you know this isn't
going to happen again?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.321
Okay, let's-let's make a deal.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.531
Once you fix your own life,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.449
then you can tell me
how to run mine.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.879
Didn't I meet you at
a bar somewhere?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.380
I didn't know you were
going to be here.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.381
Where's Silver?

18:10.423 --> 18:11.340
Not here.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.509
I needed a break,
so I got away.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.178
And since there's not a baby
supply store within sight,

18:16.220 --> 18:17.680
I think
we're safe.
Ah.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.390
You feel like hanging out?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.808
Sure, yeah.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.352
Who's to say we didn't, uh,
just bump into each other?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.188
And decided to catch
a little music.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.941
Awesome.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.149
So, I'm going to get some food

18:29.191 --> 18:31.069
that doesn't contain
any healthy fiber.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.236
I'll see you in five.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.696
Okay.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.746
So... looks like
you totally hooked up

18:41.788 --> 18:43.915
with that girl from the
bar the other night
and didn't tell us.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.249
Ah, she's-she's a nice girl.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.418
I didn't want to make
a big deal.
Mm-hmm.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.296
And if her boss found out it
could cause a lot of problems.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.839
Hey, so can you do me a favor,

18:51.881 --> 18:53.257
and just keep this between us?

18:53.299 --> 18:58.096
You want me to lie to the
guys about what I just saw?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.557
I'm starting to see some cracks
in that moral code of yours.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.517
But, hey, your
secret's safe with me.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.728
I mean, that's what Cronus
is all about, right?

19:05.770 --> 19:08.481
Friends helping each other out.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.190
All right, I got to go man,
I'll see ya.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.859
See ya.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.365
Man, this is probably
the best taco

19:18.407 --> 19:19.575
I've ever had in my life.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.119
And I'm not just saying
that because

19:21.160 --> 19:22.495
I've been working
since 8: 00.
Thanks.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.247
This event's actually turning
into huge business for me.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.500
Yeah, well, hopefully
for me, too.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.085
Running this contest
was my sister's idea,

19:29.127 --> 19:31.295
and it's actually turning out
to be a pretty good one.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.379
You know what?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.007
I kind of got dragged into this
the same way.

19:34.048 --> 19:34.924
But I'm having a blast.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.384
I-I-I'm Mark.
Dixon.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.178
Good to meet you, man.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.514
Uh, what are you doing here?

19:41.555 --> 19:42.974
I'm getting a taco.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.185
Mark, this is
my sister, Annie.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.520
Wait, she's your sister?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.064
And Dixon is my one
and only brother.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.190
If you know what I mean?

19:51.231 --> 19:52.191
I don't.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.484
Look, I'm just here
to win Naomi's

19:53.526 --> 19:54.610
food truck contest.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.113
Wait, this whole contest
was Naomi's idea?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.157
Yeah, I didn't realize
throwing contests

19:59.198 --> 20:01.283
for your relatives
was a family tradition.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.702
So, you guys
know each other

20:02.743 --> 20:04.453
and you know Naomi?

20:04.495 --> 20:05.746
We shouldn't hold
the line up.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.166
Uh, we would love to
stick around and chat

20:08.207 --> 20:09.291
but Dixon and I have a
lot to do right now

20:09.333 --> 20:10.376
and I'm sure
you do, too.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.669
It was nice
meeting you. Bye.

(laughs)

21:03.303 --> 21:04.680
Wolfgang, thanks
again for coming.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.682
You have turned our
little contest

21:06.724 --> 21:08.184
into an enormous success.

21:08.226 --> 21:12.354
I love helping young chefs get
the recognition they deserve.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.647
How are you finding the food?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.399
Anyone in particular standing
out in your mind?

21:15.441 --> 21:16.358
As a matter of fact,

21:16.400 --> 21:19.028
the taco truck over
there is fantastic.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.696
You know,
I'm completely impartial,

21:20.738 --> 21:22.656
but they're my favorite, too.
(laughs)

21:22.698 --> 21:26.285
Right now, he's in first place
with this crepe truck over here.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.162
Oh, tied?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.372
Yeah, maybe I have to go for
another tasting.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.374
That's an excellent idea.
(laughs)

21:32.416 --> 21:34.293
But first, do you want to go
cleanse your palate

21:34.334 --> 21:35.253
over at the beer garden?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.462
You can tell them
Naomi sent you.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.922
Thanks.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.139
Mmm. Peppers.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.683
Careful, these jalapeños
are painfully spicy.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.185
Everyone is loving your tacos,

21:51.227 --> 21:52.645
but... the contest
isn't over yet.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.563
So, if you have any tricks up
your sleeve,

21:54.605 --> 21:56.356
you might want to whip
them out now.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.566
What kind of tricks?

21:57.608 --> 22:01.821
Oh, I don't, a secret
sauce or something.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.905
This is pretty much what I do.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.364
Well, you don't want

22:04.406 --> 22:05.449
anything getting in the way

22:05.491 --> 22:07.201
of opening up
your restaurant.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.494
Besides, if you're
anything like me,

22:08.535 --> 22:10.204
you want to crush
the competition.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.706
Well, then, I guess
I'm not anything like you.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.541
I got to get back to work.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.692
(singing softly)

22:41.568 --> 22:43.279
Hey, Ade.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.404
Look, I really need your help.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.158
Um, I'm kind of trying
to learn this song.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.659
Can it wait? This is,
like, an emergency, all right?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.452
Michaela, she bailed
on yoga class.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.662
Now I can't find her anywhere.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.539
Oh, my God, seriously?

22:53.580 --> 22:55.499
What? This is important.
Yeah, like,

22:55.541 --> 22:56.583
way more important than anything

22:56.625 --> 22:57.835
going on in my life right now.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.461
Like the fact that
I'm about to get on stage

22:59.503 --> 23:01.505
with a band that I just met
five minutes ago.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.590
Or how about yesterday,
when I was in court with Liam

23:03.632 --> 23:04.717
and he tried to strangle me?

23:04.758 --> 23:05.926
What?

23:05.968 --> 23:07.511
Liam tried to strangle you?

23:07.553 --> 23:08.846
(scoffs)
You know what?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.223
Don't even worry about it.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.431
It doesn't affect your life,

23:11.473 --> 23:12.975
so it's not important, right?

23:13.017 --> 23:15.311
Now, if you'll excuse me,

23:15.353 --> 23:17.604
I have to go try
and save my career.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.323

as interesting

23:28.824 --> 23:30.784
as what just happened
at the food truck.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.371
Dixon, nothing was going on.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.872
I just needed
to get you back here.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.832
I mean, I didn't put on
this whole contest

23:36.874 --> 23:37.958
so you could stand around

23:38.000 --> 23:39.752
chatting with some taco guy.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.920
Well, he seemed
like he was

23:40.961 --> 23:42.420
more than just
some taco guy.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.505
He wasn't.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.464
Annie, come on.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.507
We're grown, okay?

23:45.549 --> 23:46.675
You can tell me the truth.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.510
What, did you sleep
with him or something?

23:48.552 --> 23:50.179
Ew, Dixon. No.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.429
Okay, fine. If
you won't tell me,

23:51.471 --> 23:52.514
then I know Naomi will.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.640
Okay.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.725
Okay, look.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.812
He is not just the taco guy.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.940
He's our half-brother.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.733
He's our what?

24:02.775 --> 24:03.901
Naomi tracked him down.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.945
She insists that she needs
family in her life,

24:05.986 --> 24:07.363
but I told her I didn't want

24:07.405 --> 24:09.489
any part of it.
And you weren't
gonna tell me?

24:09.531 --> 24:10.908
I was trying to protect you.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.618
The last time I saw you
this stressed out,

24:12.659 --> 24:14.078
you ended up in rehab,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.453
okay? So...

24:15.495 --> 24:17.497
I don't care what Naomi
needs in her life,

24:17.539 --> 24:19.375
because I need you in mine.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.419
You're my brother, not him.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.796
I admit things aren't
great for me right now,

24:23.837 --> 24:25.798
but there's nothing
that's gonna put me

24:25.839 --> 24:26.966
back on drugs.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.884
How can you be so sure of that?

24:28.926 --> 24:30.636
Because I have a
12-step program.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.762
Because I have you.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.306
A crazy-ass sister
who's always

24:33.347 --> 24:34.514
gonna be there for me.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.267
So, I totally understand

24:36.309 --> 24:37.601
why Naomi would
need something

24:37.643 --> 24:38.978
like that in her life.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.314
I just worry
about you, you know?

24:41.355 --> 24:43.149
I know, I know.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.776
But, uh, like it or not,

24:45.818 --> 24:48.486
I'm not your only
brother anymore.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.740

24:51.782 --> 24:53.491

We won!

24:53.533 --> 24:55.493
You won.
All you.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.954
Congratulations, Mark.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.623
Your tacos were some of the best
I have ever tasted.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.459
You have no idea
what that means to me.

25:01.499 --> 25:02.668
Honestly, when I saw
the crepe truck,

25:02.709 --> 25:03.877
I didn't think I could win.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.421
That guy does some great work.

25:05.463 --> 25:06.464
I thought so, too.

25:06.504 --> 25:07.547
But after my second tasting,

25:07.589 --> 25:10.508
then he put something crazy
in his batter.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.886
It tasted like
jalapenos.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.930
I'm sorry, did you
say "jalapenos"?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.098
Mark, you
might want to

25:16.140 --> 25:17.641
pose for the
cameras here.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.809

What?

25:34.408 --> 25:35.868
You sabotaged
another chef's food

25:35.909 --> 25:37.036
so I'd win some contest?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.204
What kind of person does that?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.413
I needed you to win.

Liam.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.741
Ade told me
what happened yesterday.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.701
I really don't want
to talk about it.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.078
I'm just here

27:01.120 --> 27:02.079
to listen to some music

27:02.121 --> 27:03.997
and grab a beer
while Navid's buying.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.210
♪ When you feel it ♪

27:08.252 --> 27:09.503
Michaela!

27:09.545 --> 27:10.670
I've been calling you

27:10.712 --> 27:12.465
and looking for you...

27:12.506 --> 27:14.007
Are you drinking beer?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.134
No, the-the beer's mine.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.302
Uh, don't worry about it,

27:16.343 --> 27:17.635
I just gave her a little taste.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.721
So, what, y-you bail on yoga

27:19.763 --> 27:20.889
so you can come and party?

27:20.931 --> 27:23.016
I just needed a
break. All right?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.477
I mean, I thought
about telling you,

27:24.518 --> 27:25.769
but I didn't want
you wigging out.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.853
I'm not pregnant yet.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.646
I think it's cool
if I have a beer.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.274
MAN:
Come on...

27:30.316 --> 27:31.900
let the girl
have a drink, you know?

27:31.942 --> 27:32.985
Maybe Navid'll get lucky again.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.570
Okay, what the hell
is this guy talking about?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.737
He's drunk,
just ignore him.

27:35.779 --> 27:36.863
Are you seriously
telling me, man,

27:36.905 --> 27:38.198
that you didn't
bag this chick
No.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.075
at that bar
last weekend?

27:40.117 --> 27:42.660
Because the official Cronus
position, uh, is that you did.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.829
You know what, buddy? I think

27:43.870 --> 27:45.581
it's time for you to shut up.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.707
Wait. Did you guys hook up?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.876
Silver, it's not what you think.
MICHAELA:
Oh, my God, screw this.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.045
I don't care if Shane
and the rest of my family

27:52.087 --> 27:54.173
think I'm like
the Whore of Babylon.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.715
Navid and I hooked up.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.800
All right?
And who knows,

27:56.842 --> 27:58.135
maybe we'll
do it again.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.219
Hey, dude.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.346
What's your problem, man?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.679
My problem is everyone asking me

28:01.721 --> 28:02.973
what my problem is.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.642
(crowd gasps)

28:05.601 --> 28:07.227
Liam, what are you doing?

28:08.187 --> 28:09.771
I got to get some air.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.983
(grunts)
Hey!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.610
Seriously?

28:14.652 --> 28:16.487
You have to give me
a chance to fix this.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.238
Being adopted doesn't
make me an orphan.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.948
And it doesn't make you
my Daddy Warbucks.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.825
I was fine before you
came into my life.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.951
Yes, well,
maybe I wasn't, okay?

28:22.993 --> 28:23.994
In case
you haven't noticed,

28:24.036 --> 28:25.996
my life is kind of
a mess right now.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.081
I-I just...
I really need my brother.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.416
I'm not your brother.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.418
And I don't even know you.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.050
Fire!

28:39.301 --> 28:41.595
(tires squeal)

28:41.637 --> 28:44.640
(Naomi screams, Mark grunts)

28:44.682 --> 28:45.724
Liam, wait, where we going, man?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.142
(screams in distance)

28:47.184 --> 28:48.227
(screams)

29:03.325 --> 29:05.369
Hey, that's the guy
that punched me.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.370
His name's Liam Court,

29:06.412 --> 29:07.454
and I want you
to arrest his ass.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.122
Sir, you're gonna need
to come with us.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.833
You got to be kidding me.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.963
Mark?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.301
I'm sorry.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.264
(Naomi sighs)

29:27.224 --> 29:29.851
Is she gonna be okay?

29:36.066 --> 29:37.276
Hey, guys.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.570
I'm really sorry

29:39.612 --> 29:40.862
this didn't work out.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.281
We were killing it up there.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.949
But who knows?

29:43.990 --> 29:45.659
Maybe we'll still win.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.619
You know, honestly?

29:46.660 --> 29:47.745
We thought you'd put
a little bit

29:47.786 --> 29:48.746
more into your performance.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.748
You know, rip your
top off like you did

29:50.789 --> 29:51.624
at the charity event.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.501
But I thought you liked
my singing.
I do.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.336
But I said we were fans
of your work,

29:56.378 --> 29:58.130
which includes showing
a little something extra.

29:58.171 --> 30:02.259
It's kind of what
you're known for.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.101
You're here.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.936
I wasn't sure
where you were going.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.063
Maybe you should put a
tracking device in my car.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.232
(laughs)
I'm sorry,

30:17.274 --> 30:18.984
I just can't believe
that you slept with Navid

30:19.025 --> 30:20.068
and didn't tell me.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.321
Well, I can't believe
you think it's okay

30:22.362 --> 30:24.490
to dictate my behavior
for the next nine months.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.032
It's a baby, Silver.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.494
People have them
all the time.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.454
Yeah, but this is
my baby, okay?

30:30.496 --> 30:32.205
And since I can't
carry it myself,

30:32.247 --> 30:33.457
I'm paying you
to be responsible

30:33.499 --> 30:34.541
and take it seriously.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.878
All right, look.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.006
I know this is weird for you,

30:41.047 --> 30:43.133
because it's really weird
for me, too.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.551
I had a vision

30:44.593 --> 30:46.178
for how my pregnancy would go,

30:46.219 --> 30:50.098
and it most definitely
did not involve a surrogate.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.350
So, everything that I was

30:51.391 --> 30:54.269
planning on doing
for my baby, I...

30:54.311 --> 30:57.564
I have to do through you.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.149
Does that make sense?

31:00.108 --> 31:01.360
Yeah, it does.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.570
But you spend
so much time

31:03.612 --> 31:04.988
obsessing over this baby

31:05.030 --> 31:07.073
that you don't have time
for anything else.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.451
Not a relationship, not school,

31:09.493 --> 31:10.577
not even your friends.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.162
I just want everything
to be perfect.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.539
And is it?

31:15.081 --> 31:16.667
Take it from me.

31:16.709 --> 31:17.876
From somebody whose family

31:17.917 --> 31:20.462
is completely over-involved
and controlling.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.381
It's not healthy.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.132
Not for you, and
certainly not

31:24.174 --> 31:25.384
for the baby.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.566
Hey, Josh.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.859
Hey, Campbell, uh,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.109
do-do you have a second?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.111
Man, I'm sorry Simon
outed you and that girl

31:45.153 --> 31:46.238
to all your friends.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.823
Kid's got a big mouth.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.115
But Liam really
laid him out, huh?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.992
Hope he doesn't
get into a ton of trouble.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.870
Yeah, well, I guess it
all depends on Simon.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.496
Yup.
He's a... he's a Cronus guy,

31:54.538 --> 31:55.831
right?
Mm-hmm.

31:55.873 --> 31:56.874
Is there any way

31:56.915 --> 31:57.916
that you could talk to him

31:57.957 --> 31:59.334
and convince him to let
the whole thing go?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.378
Wait a second,
you're seriously asking me

32:01.420 --> 32:02.838
to bend the rules for you again?

32:02.880 --> 32:04.130
Because I thought you had

32:04.172 --> 32:05.424
a whole thing about that.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.759
Well, no, this is different.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.510
Okay, uh, Liam's a
good friend of mine,

32:08.552 --> 32:10.429
and, uh, he could
really use my help.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.971
No, I get it, I really do.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.390
It just... it seems
a little unfair

32:13.432 --> 32:15.141
if you're not willing
to return the favor,

32:15.183 --> 32:16.351
you know?

32:16.393 --> 32:18.311
The offer's still on the table.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.272
See you at the physics final
tomorrow, all right?

32:20.313 --> 32:22.733
Yeah.
All right, buddy.

32:32.576 --> 32:33.911
Hey.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.456
I wanted to come
and check on you.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.374
(sighs)

32:39.416 --> 32:41.084
Dixon found out about Mark,

32:41.126 --> 32:42.419
and he was okay with it.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.046
Turns out I don't need
to worry about him

32:45.088 --> 32:46.256
as much as I thought.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.092
Are you gonna be okay?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.176
I managed to

32:50.218 --> 32:51.929
screw up every
meaningful relationship

32:51.970 --> 32:53.263
I've ever had in my life, but...

32:53.305 --> 32:58.059
My, uh, husband, my sister,
my parents, everybody.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.144
(chuckles)

32:59.185 --> 33:01.647
It's okay.

33:01.688 --> 33:06.234
I just wanted someone
to share a bond with me

33:06.276 --> 33:08.445
that we couldn't
walk away from, you know?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.489
Something like you have
with Dixon.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.407
No matter
what happens,

33:12.449 --> 33:15.619
you always have each other.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.456
You're his something.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.961
And that's, uh...

33:24.002 --> 33:26.546
something I may never have.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.381
You don't know that.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.343
Since I don't have any more
half-siblings out there, I...

33:33.303 --> 33:35.221
Well, I figure,

33:35.263 --> 33:37.724
Mark was my last shot.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.203
That is one
messed-up food truck.

33:58.244 --> 34:02.332
Look, if Naomi sent you to make
some kind of sales pitch,

34:02.374 --> 34:04.167
you can save your breath.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.004
I don't want anything to do
with her or your crazy family.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.129
I totally get that.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.382
When I found out about
you, I felt the same way.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.342
I kind of got the feeling
you didn't like me.

34:12.384 --> 34:16.179
Yeah, well, family can be
a huge pain in the ass.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.514
I recently figured that out.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.391
So I'm guessing you don't
have any brothers or sisters?

34:20.433 --> 34:24.103
My parents adopted me because
they couldn't have kids.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.524
I gave them so much trouble,
they didn't want more.
Oh.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.609
My family adopted Dixon
when we were eight.

34:29.650 --> 34:33.487
And even though
it hasn't always been easy,

34:33.530 --> 34:35.741
it's really nice knowing
there's someone there

34:35.782 --> 34:37.534
who loves you and has your back.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.327
But maybe you
have enough

34:39.369 --> 34:41.454
people in your life
like that already,

34:41.496 --> 34:45.083
in which case,
congratulations.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.127
Anyway, Naomi wanted me to
swing by and give you this.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.338
She wants to take the
truck off your hands

34:50.380 --> 34:53.632
so you can
buy a new one.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.510
She didn't have to do that.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.512
You're right.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.472
She didn't.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.773
(sighs)

35:09.524 --> 35:11.234
Hey.
Mm.

35:11.276 --> 35:14.112
Hey, is, uh...
is everything okay?

35:14.153 --> 35:16.155
Yeah, it will be.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.909
That kid that I hit yesterday
decided not to press charges,

35:18.951 --> 35:20.493
so I'm off the hook.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.038
No way. Hey,
that's-that's fantastic.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.291
Yeah. I could have really hurt
that guy, though... or Ade.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.501
I realized that I just
can't keep pretending

35:28.543 --> 35:30.128
like nothing's wrong.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.380
Yeah. So, uh,
what are you gonna do?

35:32.422 --> 35:35.550
Well, according to
my court-appointed therapist,

35:35.592 --> 35:38.053
the first step is confronting
what happened to me,

35:38.095 --> 35:40.430
so... that's what I'm doing.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.391
You're not going to kill someone
with a screwdriver, are you?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.351
No.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.353
(chuckles quietly)

35:47.395 --> 35:49.773
Oh, uh, by the way,
I ran into Campbell.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.067
He wanted me to give you these.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.111
Lakers tickets, court side.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.738
He said, uh, some of the guys
were going out to celebrate

35:56.780 --> 35:59.157
a physics test they aced?

35:59.198 --> 36:01.284
Oh.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.664
Awesome.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.501
I got your text.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.420
What's wrong? Michaela ran out
of flaxseed oil?

36:12.462 --> 36:13.672
(sighs)

36:13.713 --> 36:16.925
Okay, I totally deserve that.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.511
Look, I've been
a terrible friend lately.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.472
(sighs)

36:22.514 --> 36:23.890
I've been self-centered,

36:23.932 --> 36:27.602
and I've been totally obsessed
with this baby thing.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.771
I'm sorry. I miss you.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.025
I've really missed you, too.

36:33.066 --> 36:35.360
I'm not saying I won't still
occasionally check in

36:35.401 --> 36:37.195
on Michaela,
or go a little baby-crazy,

36:37.236 --> 36:39.698
but I'm gonna try to have
a normal life again.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.741
You know, like,
turn over a new leaf.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.785
I'm turning over
a new leaf, too.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.746
That wardrobe malfunction
is going to follow me around

36:46.788 --> 36:48.999
as long as I'm in the spotlight.

36:49.041 --> 36:52.251
So I've decided to take some
time off from my singing career.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.130
That might be the best news
I've ever heard, because

36:55.172 --> 36:57.674
I talked Naomi into letting
me have her brother's old

36:57.716 --> 36:59.217
food truck.

36:59.258 --> 37:02.137
What are you going to do,
sell burritos, or...?

37:02.179 --> 37:03.596
No, 'cause the kitchen's shot.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.515
But I figured...

37:05.557 --> 37:08.185
we can come up
with something creative.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.686
We could do something awesome.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.813
If you want to be my partner.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.149
Oh, my God!

37:14.191 --> 37:16.275
These are adorable!
I love them!

37:16.317 --> 37:18.904
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yes. Yes!

37:18.945 --> 37:21.364
(laughs)
Gonna be awesome!

37:21.406 --> 37:22.699
Yup.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.825
Yes!

37:23.867 --> 37:25.535
(laughter)

37:28.205 --> 37:29.873
(doorbell rings)
Ow. Oh.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.875
Come in!

37:31.917 --> 37:33.960
(footsteps approaching)

37:37.630 --> 37:40.341
Annie didn't give you my check?

37:40.383 --> 37:43.386
She did. I'm gonna
make this short.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.347
I've always felt like I
had a pretty full life,

37:46.389 --> 37:50.643
and then you swooped in
and... obviously need me.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.395
(sighs)
I'm not a charity case.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.438
I can order in.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.775
Oh, and waste such a
beautiful kitchen?

37:56.816 --> 37:59.027
Losing my truck
gives me an excuse

37:59.069 --> 38:01.613
to do something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.782
And even without your
jalapenos, I'm pretty sure

38:03.823 --> 38:06.618
I would have kicked that
fake Frenchie's butt.

38:06.659 --> 38:10.455
So... you still interested

38:10.496 --> 38:12.498
in opening that restaurant?

38:12.540 --> 38:14.417
Are you serious?

38:14.459 --> 38:16.544
A few rules. You leave
the cooking to me,

38:16.586 --> 38:17.629
and no more surprises. Deal?

38:17.670 --> 38:20.215
Deal. I'm a horrible cook.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.217
I'll drop by tomorrow.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.886
You can show me this
amazing waterfront place.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.224
Oh.

38:29.266 --> 38:32.185
I'll see you later... sis.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.312
(footsteps retreating)

38:35.688 --> 38:38.150

38:38.191 --> 38:41.360

38:50.578 --> 38:52.330
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were here.

38:52.371 --> 38:55.167
No, no, no, don't-don't...
don't apologize.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.794
That was... that was actually
pretty great.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.378
Too bad I didn't find

38:59.420 --> 39:01.464
anyone like you
at that contest yesterday.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.424
What do you mean?
I own

39:03.466 --> 39:05.844
a music label, and I was there
looking for new talent.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.513
Um, someone I could turn
into a star.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.099
It was a complete wash, but you
know, it's okay. I'll be fine.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.351
I'm sorry,
can we go back to the part

39:13.392 --> 39:14.727
about you owning a music label?

39:14.769 --> 39:17.856
Are you saying
you could make me a star?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.734
I have to say, I'm happy

39:21.776 --> 39:24.279
someone finally decided
to rent this space.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.698
It's been empty
for a long time.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.784
So, what are you going
to do with it?

39:29.826 --> 39:31.619
I don't know.

39:31.661 --> 39:33.538
Uh, I decided it was time

39:33.579 --> 39:35.248
to start looking
towards the future,

39:35.290 --> 39:37.959
and this seemed like the
right place to start.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.503
Well, good luck.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.672
Thank you.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.561
ASHLEY:
You'll be traveling in this.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.653
LIAM:
You're gonna put me in a box?

40:05.695 --> 40:08.990
ASHLEY:
Just long enough to ship you
to Southern Mexico.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.791
LIAM:
You're insane.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.837
ASHLEY:
I'm not insane.
I'm doing this for you.
