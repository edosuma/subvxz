WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:09.576
Hey, Frasier.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.577
Hello, Poppy.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.078
You should have your
hearing checked.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.079
I've been yelling,
"Wait up,"

00:13.079 --> 00:14.381
for the last
four blocks.

00:14.381 --> 00:15.648
Well, I must be getting old.

00:15.648 --> 00:17.650
Like an old man
could walk that fast.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.152
You were practically running
the last block.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.154
Did I ever tell you about
my uncle who ran everywhere?

00:21.154 --> 00:22.088
He ran to the store...

00:22.088 --> 00:24.024
Well, that's
a very amusing story.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.824
I'll see you
at the station.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.559
Roz!

00:26.559 --> 00:28.962
Good God. Thank
God you were here.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.463
I know exactly how
you feel.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.898
Last week, I ducked
into a bathroom stall

00:31.898 --> 00:32.966
to get away from her,
and there were

00:32.966 --> 00:34.801
three other women
already in there.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.637
Gosh.

00:37.637 --> 00:38.538
Listen, I have
a favor to ask.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.372
This friend of mine
is running

00:39.372 --> 00:40.940
this charity dinner/dance
Friday night...

00:40.940 --> 00:42.208
Oh, Roz,
say no more.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.476
What do they need,
an autographed picture

00:43.476 --> 00:44.344
for their silent auction?

00:44.344 --> 00:46.646
That would be a silent auction.

00:46.646 --> 00:47.981
Oh, very funny.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.449
No, what I was hoping you would
do is buy some tickets.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.384
They're only 100 bucks each.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.352
I don't know, Roz.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.319
You know,
I'd have to take a date.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.821
Seattle does have
certain expectations

00:54.821 --> 00:56.790
about the sort of person
I should be seen with.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.591
Well, that's easy.
Here he is. Oh.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.326
Let's see if he's free.
I'll let you know.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.729
Hey, Roz. Frasier.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.730
Niles.
Mind if I join you?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.230
Well, actually,
I'm not staying.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.299
I'm avoiding
someone.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.301
Oh? Who?

01:08.301 --> 01:09.736
The new so-called
arts critic

01:09.736 --> 01:12.072
at the station--
Poppy. Oh. Uh-huh.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.273
The woman
drives me mad.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.841
She's gassing
on endlessly

01:14.841 --> 01:16.176
about the most
mundane matters.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.011
It's absolutely
infuriating,

01:18.011 --> 01:20.380
as is that
smirk of yours.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.681
Well, I'm sorry.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.249
I've noticed
that not a day goes by

01:23.249 --> 01:25.085
that you don't bad-mouth
this woman.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.921
Well, with good reason.
The woman is a wind sock.

01:27.921 --> 01:28.755
Mm-hmm.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.589
I'm wondering
if someone

01:29.589 --> 01:31.591
isn't protesting
a bit too much.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.594
She's very attractive,
obviously well-bred.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.063
Perhaps all this pigtails-
in-the-inkwell hostility

01:37.063 --> 01:39.065
is actually a latent attraction.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.533
Oh, well, bravo,
Dr. Crane.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.402
Yes, I think you're really
onto something there.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.070
POPPY:
Hey, where'd Roz go?

01:44.070 --> 01:45.338
Oh, she dashed
off to the office.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.906
We're going to continue
our meeting there.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.241
You know, Poppy,
I was just telling my brother

01:48.241 --> 01:51.111
what an enchanting
storyteller you are.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
Why don't you
take my seat,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.615
and he can find
out for himself.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.617
Ta-ta.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.119
Well, it's, uh,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
nice to finally
meet you, Poppy.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.991
Must be quite a story
behind that name.

02:04.991 --> 02:06.793
Yes.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.164
So...

02:11.164 --> 02:12.665
you're the new arts critic
at the station.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.101
That... that must be
interesting.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.337
Oh, yes.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.240
Okay, well, um...

02:20.240 --> 02:21.241
if you don't feel
like talking,

02:21.241 --> 02:22.742
I should really
be running anyway.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.676
No, don't go.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.612
I am just amazed

02:25.612 --> 02:27.447
at how different you are
from your brother.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.249
He's sort of
intimidating.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.750
I get so flustered
around him,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.285
I just start
babbling.

02:32.285 --> 02:35.555
But you...
you're different.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.790
You're very warm.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.259
Thank you.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.261
So are you.

02:41.261 --> 02:42.762
And polite.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.698
Not to mention
stylish and charming

02:45.698 --> 02:49.002
and incredibly handsome.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.506
Oh, my God, am
I babbling again?

02:53.506 --> 02:54.941
If you were,
I'd be too charming

02:54.941 --> 02:56.409
and polite to tell you.

03:01.314 --> 03:05.652
Well, what the
hell are you doing?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.423
I've been waiting

03:10.423 --> 03:12.292
for 20 minutes.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.762
I am so sorry.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.031
You're probably
wondering

03:18.031 --> 03:19.732
who I am.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.669
I'm mildly curious.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.638
I was in the shower--
my shower...

03:25.638 --> 03:27.640
Uh, I just moved in next door.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.642
I probably should have started
with that, huh?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.644
Anyway... oh, I'm
Regan Shaw, by the way.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.413
Nice to see you.
Anyway, uh...

03:33.413 --> 03:35.615
the doorbell rang, and I figured
it was the phone guy,

03:35.615 --> 03:37.183
'cause I've been waiting
all day long.

03:37.183 --> 03:40.186
So I ran to catch him,
stepped out into the hallway

03:40.186 --> 03:41.955
and locked myself out.

03:41.955 --> 03:46.259
Luckily, luckily,
your father came along.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.062
Hey, Fras.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.231
Yes, that was lucky.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066
All right, well, this
should keep you nice and warm,

03:53.066 --> 03:54.567
and I'll just run
in the kitchen

03:54.567 --> 03:57.303
and get you
your herbal tea.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.138
If you'll excuse me,

03:59.138 --> 04:01.107
I'll just show my father

04:01.107 --> 04:03.009
where it's kept.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.845
Pretty sweet, huh?

04:05.845 --> 04:06.846
I just found her
right out in the hall.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.282
Yes, well, I'm sorry, Dad,
but you can't keep her.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.620
No. I brought her here for you.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.089
I've been talking you up
the whole time. Really?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.490
Yeah. Listen.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.791
I'm serving this one
to you on a platter.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.562
In fact, if it wasn't
for the jasmine on your robe,

04:22.562 --> 04:24.364
I'd say that this one
was a slam dunk.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.565
I just wonder...
It's a basketball term.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.567
Yes, I know that, Dad.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.003
I just wonder how to chat up
a half-naked woman

04:30.503 --> 04:31.804
without looking uncouth.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.640
Well, just
be friendly.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.476
She's a veterinarian,
she's single, uh...

04:36.476 --> 04:39.312
She's very athletic,
as you can tell from that body.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.680
Lord in heaven!

04:40.680 --> 04:42.015
Oh, Dad, please...

04:42.015 --> 04:43.516
Just because you're
serving the cake

04:43.516 --> 04:44.984
doesn't mean you can't
have a few crumbs

04:44.984 --> 04:47.387
that drop off.
(groans)

04:47.387 --> 04:48.788
(chuckling):
Hi.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.791
Well, here we go.

04:51.791 --> 04:52.625
There you are.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.494
Now, uh, I got
a call to make,

04:54.494 --> 04:56.996
so Frasier will keep you
entertained.

04:56.996 --> 04:57.997
Thanks for the tea.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.432
You're welcome.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.802
So, uh... you're next door.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.570
Oh, that's right.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.740
Judge Gilroy moved
in with his daughter.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.443
I bet he never wandered into
your apartment wearing a towel.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.811
No, no. I did
hear he wandered

05:11.811 --> 05:14.314
into work one day
wearing a towel, though.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.816
I guess that's why he had
to move in with his daughter.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.686
That was dumb.
I walked off with your car keys.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.889
I should have known
from the big "BMW" on it.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.197
Thank you, Dad.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.032
So...

05:33.032 --> 05:35.401
"Regan." That's an unusual name.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.869
Is it, by any chance, from...

05:36.869 --> 05:37.837
From King Lear, yeah.
A-ha.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.672
One of the ungrateful
daughters.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.841
I don't know what
my dad was thinking.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.643
Never do.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.144
I'm sorry.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.447
I have some issues
with my father.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.248
Excuse me again.

05:50.249 --> 05:53.586
I have no idea what
that would be like.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.691
Well, I'd better be
on my way, huh,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.360
and, uh,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.994
just let you
two talk.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.364
Oh, he's a wonderful
listener, you know?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.865
In fact, that's the motto

06:05.865 --> 06:08.801
on his very popular
radio show: "I listen."

06:08.801 --> 06:10.670
Yes, Dad,
don't forget

06:10.670 --> 06:12.805
my sign-off:
"Good-bye."

06:17.877 --> 06:19.812
I actually listen to your show.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.281
Really? Well, I'm
flattered. Thank you.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.217
I think if I hadn't gone
into veterinary medicine,

06:24.217 --> 06:25.485
it would have been psychology.

06:25.485 --> 06:29.255
I guess I was always
just drawn to animals.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.727
Yes, it is hard
not to love them.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.074

06:48.674 --> 06:51.744
MARTIN:
I just feel so responsible.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.247
Maybe there was something
more I could have said,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.582
something more I
could have done.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.853
I keep playing it
over and over in my head.

07:00.853 --> 07:05.258
I'll ask her out today, Dad.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.693
So, Dr. Crane,
do you believe women have

07:07.693 --> 07:09.195
an intuition about men?

07:09.195 --> 07:10.696
Uh, intuition?

07:10.696 --> 07:12.698
Well, like
they might know

07:12.698 --> 07:14.200
when a man has
a little crush,

07:14.200 --> 07:16.202
you know, by the way
he fidgets

07:16.202 --> 07:19.539
or gets a look
in his eye or... Well...

07:19.539 --> 07:22.608
(alarm ringing)

07:22.608 --> 07:23.943
(alarm stops)

07:26.446 --> 07:28.948
I only ask because
I'm getting that feeling

07:28.948 --> 07:30.883
from your brother.
Really? Hmm.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.785
He's all moony-eyed today.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.287
There's someone
he's quite keen on.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.289
Yes. Actually, I know who it is.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.291
I called him on it yesterday
in the coffee shop.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.258
He won't admit to it.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.060
The problem is...

07:41.060 --> 07:42.862
Yeah?

07:43.362 --> 07:45.364
I've developed
a crush myself,

07:45.364 --> 07:46.833
and it happens to be...

07:48.568 --> 07:49.836
Frasier?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.176
What ya doing?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.214
Nothing. Come in. Come in.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.716
So, Niles,
how are you?

08:03.716 --> 08:06.552
Uh, well, the question is,

08:06.552 --> 08:09.622
how are you?

08:09.622 --> 08:10.957
I hear you've been
mooning around

08:10.957 --> 08:12.391
like a lovesick schoolboy.

08:12.391 --> 08:13.759
Who told you that?

08:13.759 --> 08:14.594
Oh, let's just say

08:14.594 --> 08:15.595
the birds around
here are chirping.

08:15.595 --> 08:19.165
Anyway... are you
prepared to admit

08:19.165 --> 08:22.101
that my little theory
yesterday was correct?

08:22.101 --> 08:24.604
Are you talking
about Poppy? Yes.

08:24.604 --> 08:28.040
The woman you so adamantly
denied having any attraction to.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.009
I still do. She's loathsome.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.880
Does it gall you so much
to admit I'm right?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.047
But you're not right.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.350
Oh. Well, then,
who is this person

08:37.350 --> 08:38.618
you're so interested in?

08:38.618 --> 08:40.419
You don't know her.
Uh-huh.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.921
Tell me about her.
It's premature.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.422
Oh, brother.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.423
All right, fine.

08:44.423 --> 08:46.325
If you must know,
the woman happens to be...

08:46.325 --> 08:47.193
(knocking on door)
Hello?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.462
Her-- my next-door neighbor.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.064
Oh, what good timing she has.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.334
Hi. Come on in.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.336
I just wanted
to return this teacup.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.871
Oh, well, you're
welcome anytime.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.840
Uh... Regan Shaw,

09:00.840 --> 09:03.242
this is my brother,
Dr. Niles Crane.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.612
Hello.
Hello.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.947
Do you two know
each other?

09:07.947 --> 09:09.815
Yes.
No.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.618
Well...

09:12.618 --> 09:14.053
I'll just go
get us all some coffee,

09:14.053 --> 09:19.458
and you two can decide
if you know each other or not.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.327
I'm so sorry,

09:21.327 --> 09:22.295
Dr. Crane.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.796
I was just
a little startled

09:23.796 --> 09:25.298
seeing you
outside your office.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.799
Uh, please, don't
even think about it.

09:26.799 --> 09:27.633
Have a seat.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.002
Uh... well,
so I gather

09:30.002 --> 09:31.003
this is your
new building.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.005
Yes. Right next door
to your brother,

09:33.005 --> 09:34.507
who I just met.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.509
Is that so strange?

09:36.509 --> 09:37.343
Yes. Well,
remember,

09:37.343 --> 09:40.012
I have a policy
of total confidentiality.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.381
He never needs to know that
you've started seeing me.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.888
Oh. Here it is.

09:50.957 --> 09:51.724
What did you
find out?

09:51.724 --> 09:54.226
Well, it sounded like
they've had a date or two.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.528
He mentioned
having seen her.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.798
Damn him.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.266
Come to think of it,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.267
he said something
in the elevator

10:01.267 --> 10:03.035
about having a crush on someone.

10:03.035 --> 10:04.337
I'll just have to confront him,
see if he's man enough

10:04.337 --> 10:06.639
to admit that he's horned in
on my territory.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.940
Well, excuse me,
Dr. Crane,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.942
but didn't your brother
meet her first?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.944
Oh, honestly, Daphne,
just try to keep up.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.913
It's not that complicated.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.382
Well, here we are.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.817
Actually, I can't stay.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.185
I've got
the cable man coming.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.187
Oh. Could I take
a rain check?

10:21.187 --> 10:22.188
Well, certainly.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.190
Uh... would you like

10:24.190 --> 10:26.192
to go out for
coffee sometime?

10:26.192 --> 10:27.693
Yeah, I'd like that.

10:27.693 --> 10:28.694
Great.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.196
Bye.
Bye.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.197
Bye.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.438
So, I take it
you two do know each other.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.641
Uh, we met briefly
at some event.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.542
I see.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.544
Changing the
subject completely,

10:45.544 --> 10:47.546
Daphne just mentioned
that you happen to have

10:47.546 --> 10:49.048
a little crush on
someone yourself.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.384
(sighs):
Yes, I have.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.252
Care to elaborate?

10:53.252 --> 10:54.253
Actually, I will.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.522
Unlike you, I don't mind
being candid.

10:56.522 --> 10:59.659
The woman... is Poppy.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.560
Poppy?

11:03.396 --> 11:07.066
Uh, we had coffee yesterday
after you left.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.368
Uh... you're not upset?

11:09.368 --> 11:10.236
No, not at all.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.738
Thank you
for your candor, Niles.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.741
I'm sure that you and Poppy
will be very happy together.

11:15.741 --> 11:16.709
(stifles laughter)

11:16.709 --> 11:19.178
Are you laughing at me?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.180
You think so little
of my chances?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.415
FRASIER:
No, no, Niles.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.750
I wish you and Poppy
the very best.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.220
I don't need
this smug attitude of yours.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.722
I fully intended
to discuss this amiably.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.058
You refused,
so I'll just say good-bye.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.326
Very well, thanks
for dropping by. Off you go.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.661
Oh!

11:35.661 --> 11:38.130
What kind of a fool
does he take me for?

11:38.130 --> 11:39.632
He is obviously
pursuing Regan.

11:39.632 --> 11:42.134
The man has the nerve
to say he's chasing Poppy!

11:42.134 --> 11:43.536
Poppy?
Yes, as if anyone

11:43.536 --> 11:48.074
could pursue
that insufferable air horn!

11:48.074 --> 11:49.341
If it's deceit
and chicanery he's after,

11:49.341 --> 11:50.843
I'll give him more
than he can handle.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.713
Dr. Crane, before it
gets to that level,

11:53.713 --> 11:56.115
wouldn't it make sense
for you two to just have

11:56.115 --> 11:57.883
one open and honest
conversation?

11:57.883 --> 11:59.251
Oh, honestly, Daphne,
how you manage

11:59.251 --> 12:01.687
to oversimplify
absolutely everything!

12:06.258 --> 12:08.227
These shoes
are killing me.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.762
I can't wait
to sit down.

12:09.762 --> 12:10.730
Well, you're not
going to sit there.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.032
Why not? I'm expecting
someone for coffee.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.167
Well, Niles is small.
We can share.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.035
It is not Niles.

12:16.535 --> 12:17.536
Would you stop
saying that?

12:17.536 --> 12:18.471
It happens to
be a woman.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.906
Well, I'll move
when she gets here.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.908
By the way, I still have
four tickets left

12:22.908 --> 12:24.677
for that charity ball
Friday night.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.945
Oh, I'm sorry, Roz;
thanks anyway.

12:25.945 --> 12:26.812
Oh, come on.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.680
It's for a good cause.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.548
They provide disaster relief.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.750
Howdy, partners!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.118
How soon can they get here?

12:33.619 --> 12:35.121
Frasier, I was leaving
the booth,

12:35.121 --> 12:36.122
and I saw this umbrella.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.591
I think it belongs
to you.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.992
FRASIER:
Yes.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.927
It's my emergency umbrella.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.829
I always leave it in the booth.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.266
Don't feel bad.
I'm forgetful, too.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.237
You know, I think
I'll just go...

12:51.237 --> 12:52.738
see what's
keeping my latte.

12:52.738 --> 12:56.242
Would you watch my table,
please, Roz?

13:02.815 --> 13:05.117
Hello, Roz.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.619
I noticed that
Poppy was here.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.620
Did she mention where
she was headed?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.455
No. But listen, Niles,

13:09.455 --> 13:10.790
could I interest you
in a couple of tickets

13:10.790 --> 13:12.291
for a charity ball this Friday?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.726
It's a great event.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.094
Is Frasier going?
No,

13:15.094 --> 13:16.996
but do you have to go
to everything together?

13:16.996 --> 13:17.963
I'll take two.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.466
Uh, I'm in a hurry;
I'll send you a check.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.469
Where is Niles in
such a rush off to?

13:23.469 --> 13:24.436
I have no idea.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.972
Last chance--
only two tickets left.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.374
What? I thought
there were four.

13:28.374 --> 13:29.608
Niles just bought a pair.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.477
Damn him!

13:31.477 --> 13:33.479
He's probably off to
intercept Regan right now.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.480
Who?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.981
I'm sorry, Roz.
I'm in a hurry.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.250
I'll write you
a check for these.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.518
Enjoy the table.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.988
This is the best kind
of party.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.491
We get to dress up,
have a wonderful time,

13:45.491 --> 13:47.326
and it's all
for a good cause.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.128
Well, it really is
an impressive organization.

13:49.128 --> 13:52.631
I've heard that within 24 hours
of any worldwide disaster,

13:52.631 --> 13:54.133
they can put together
a ball.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.935
(giggles)

13:55.935 --> 13:57.970
Oh, look, it's
your brother.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.104
What?

13:59.104 --> 14:00.840
NILES:
Oh. So it is.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.741
Uh, why don't you find
our table,

14:02.741 --> 14:03.742
and I'll get us
some champagne.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.744
Okay.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.248
Roz, you didn't tell me

14:09.248 --> 14:10.115
Frasier was going
to be here.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.951
Yeah, he bought
the last two tickets.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.352
After he knew I'd
be here with Poppy.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.321
Obviously, he wants to get a
shot at her himself.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.089
He brought that woman
along as his beard.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.191
Do you think Frasier's
interested in Poppy?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.026
I shouldn't
be surprised

14:21.026 --> 14:22.528
the subtle signs of
attraction are lost on you--

14:22.528 --> 14:24.530
a woman to whom the
gunning of a Harley engine

14:24.530 --> 14:26.866
is like a "come
hither" look.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.604
Hello, Roz.
Hi.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.373
I see that Niles has brought
himself a date for the evening.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.709
Yep, and you'll never guess
what he thinks.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.177
Oh, I know
exactly what he thinks.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.678
He thinks by bringing Poppy
as his patsy,

14:39.678 --> 14:41.180
he can steal a few minutes
with Regan,

14:41.180 --> 14:42.481
try to win her for himself.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.816
That's not
what he thinks. Roz!

14:43.816 --> 14:48.287
He likes Poppy.
Oh... dear, simple Roz.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.222
After six years
of listening at my feet,

14:50.222 --> 14:52.191
have you learned nothing
of the dark forces

14:52.191 --> 14:53.225
that move people?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.194
Open your ears.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.139
Are you looking
at your brother again?

15:07.139 --> 15:08.641
Yes. I'm sorry.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.643
It's just that he keeps
staring over here,

15:10.643 --> 15:11.477
for God's sakes!

15:11.477 --> 15:12.811
He hasn't paid
any attention

15:12.811 --> 15:13.646
to his date
whatsoever!

15:13.646 --> 15:15.481
Can you imagine how
that woman must feel?

15:15.481 --> 15:18.450
Yeah. Women hate that.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.352
He's doing it again.
What?

15:20.352 --> 15:21.854
My brother is
staring at us,

15:21.854 --> 15:22.888
obviously thinking

15:22.888 --> 15:24.657
what a striking couple
we make.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.226
In fact, let's give him
something to stare at.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.463
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:31.463 --> 15:32.965
Same toe as before?

15:32.965 --> 15:33.966
Yes, same toe
as before.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.200
(chuckles)

15:35.200 --> 15:38.037
What is going on
with you two tonight?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.539
All right.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.540
I suppose you're going
to find out

15:41.540 --> 15:42.541
sooner or later anyway.

15:42.541 --> 15:46.545
You see... I know
about you and Niles.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.546
You do?

15:47.546 --> 15:49.048
Yes, but it's all right.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.549
I don't mind.

15:50.549 --> 15:53.052
It's just that, well...

15:53.052 --> 15:55.054
he's really quite
smitten with you.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.055
(gasps)

15:56.055 --> 15:58.524
Oh, my God. Really?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.926
You think you're going
to lose the nail?

16:00.926 --> 16:02.928
No, no. I just need
to sit for a minute.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.965
(tango playing)

16:05.965 --> 16:08.467
Oh, my gosh, I
love the tango!

16:08.467 --> 16:09.935
You won't mind
if I dance one

16:09.935 --> 16:11.837
with your brother?
What?

16:11.837 --> 16:12.638
Well, actually,
Poppy, I...

16:12.638 --> 16:14.139
Oh, come on.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.641
Niles can keep
Regan company.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.142
Ow!

16:19.144 --> 16:21.146
Uh, you know...

16:21.146 --> 16:23.649
Regan, I'm getting
a second wind.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.417
Uh, shall we show
them how it's done?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.119
Well, actually, Dr. Crane, I...

16:27.119 --> 16:28.053
Oh, don't be so formal.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.522
We're not doctor
and patient tonight.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.524
Oops.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.333
Your brother's
quite the romantic,

16:41.834 --> 16:42.768
inviting me to a ball

16:42.768 --> 16:44.336
on our very first date.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.839
He certainly doesn't
waste time, does he?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.607
No, he doesn't,
does he?

16:53.846 --> 16:57.850
You do realize that I'm
interested in your brother.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.352
You mean you're developing
real feelings for him?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.353
Yeah.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.355
Well, you may
think so now,

17:03.355 --> 17:06.157
but trust me, your
future's not with him.

17:06.992 --> 17:10.496
I know this
is confusing.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.000
You'll see everything
more clearly

17:15.000 --> 17:16.502
when I've got you
on the couch.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.436
Oh.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.577
Well, I can't take
any more of this.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.012
All right, I
have to cut in.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.014
See? How romantic.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.016
Yes, come with me.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.520
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.889
Your tango wasn't so
impressive, either.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.690
I'm talking
about your behavior tonight.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.192
You mean that I won't
simply stand aside

17:40.192 --> 17:41.560
and let you have
the woman you want?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.929
Exactly. Obviously,
one of us has to back off--

17:43.929 --> 17:45.831
not just tonight,
but permanently.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.267
Frasier, can I talk
to you a minute alone?

17:48.267 --> 17:49.134
Of course.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.969
Just give me one more moment
with my brother.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.404
Niles, when you're
finished,

17:52.404 --> 17:53.405
I'd love
one more dance.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.408
Ah. I'll be right there.

17:57.376 --> 18:00.679
Well, I believe
she has made her choice.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.849
Yes, I believe she has.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.958
Uh...

18:12.958 --> 18:14.326
Frasier, I think
I'd like to leave,

18:14.326 --> 18:15.327
if that's all right.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.728
Leave? Already?

18:16.728 --> 18:20.032
Well, couldn't we just
have one last dance?

18:20.032 --> 18:20.933
Well, I guess.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.935
I'm just feeling
a little uncomfortable.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.403
Yes, I certainly don't
blame you for that,

18:24.403 --> 18:25.871
but you see,
now that I've spoken with him,

18:25.871 --> 18:27.372
Niles has agreed
to behave himself.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.875
Now I can... put all
my attention on you.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.376
Oh...

18:31.376 --> 18:33.378
That is a relief.

18:33.378 --> 18:34.880
I mean, you
can understand

18:34.880 --> 18:37.716
how I was a kind of
freaked out by all that.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.685
Right?

18:40.619 --> 18:43.088
Frasier.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.991
FRASIER: He's a brave
little soldier, isn't he?

18:45.991 --> 18:49.895
Awash in despair,
and yet he dances.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.363
This is when
they wrote songs

18:51.363 --> 18:53.866
that were really
about something--

18:53.866 --> 18:57.369
true love...
broken hearts...

18:57.369 --> 18:59.872
Yes, there's nothing
quite so poignant

18:59.872 --> 19:01.373
as someone with
a broken heart

19:01.373 --> 19:04.710
pretending
that it isn't.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.045
No wonder he keeps
staring over at us.

19:07.045 --> 19:11.049
He's suffered such
a crushing defeat tonight.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.551
Can we go?

19:12.551 --> 19:14.853
Well... yes, of
course, that's...

19:14.853 --> 19:16.655
that's the best
thing to do.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.057
No... let me just have
one last word with him.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.493
Oh, my God.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.428
Niles, if you don't mind.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.864
You guys are going
to wear me out.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.233
Could I see you
at the bar, please?

19:29.635 --> 19:31.103
I think I'm going
to catch a cab.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.604
Aren't you having
a good time?

19:32.604 --> 19:34.039
Frankly, no. Are you?

19:34.039 --> 19:38.310
Well, yes. I think Niles has got
quite a little crush on me.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.646
But, actually, Poppy,
there's something

19:40.646 --> 19:43.582
you should know
about Niles.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.018
Niles, I just want
you to know that I...

19:46.018 --> 19:47.519
I'm not happy
with the way

19:47.519 --> 19:49.021
things have ended
this evening.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.024
Well, neither am I.
How could I be?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.526
And the worst thing is,
it's not just tonight.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.029
What happens when we keep
running into each other?

19:57.029 --> 19:57.963
Yes.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.932
The victor will have his trophy.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.800
The loser will be empty-handed.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.169
Hardly seems worth it,
given the permanent damage

20:04.169 --> 20:05.170
this could do
to our relationship.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.171
Yes, I can't
help but wonder

20:06.171 --> 20:08.674
if perhaps we're being
a bit shortsighted.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.677
Niles, is that Regan

20:11.677 --> 20:13.145
and Poppy leaving
just now?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.648
It was, wasn't it?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.588
I want you to go after her.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.855
What?

20:23.855 --> 20:27.793
Yes. I won't stand
in your way.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.729
No. Frasier,
I would feel better

20:30.729 --> 20:32.130
if you went after her.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.299
No. No, I couldn't
do that to you.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.601
(sighs)

20:35.601 --> 20:38.370
I think we're both feeling
the same thing.

20:38.370 --> 20:43.141
I know we are...
you noble bastard.

20:43.141 --> 20:46.011
Right back at you.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.248
Oh, it's for the best.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.517
After all, the most important
thing is our friendship.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.686
I think that's worth
drinking to.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.021
Two bourbons.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.489
You know, while
we're at it,

20:57.489 --> 20:58.957
let's propose a toast

20:58.957 --> 21:01.960
to one pretty
remarkable woman.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.462
Well, she'd have to be

21:03.462 --> 21:04.963
to have won
both of our hearts.

21:04.963 --> 21:05.931
Hear, hear.

21:05.931 --> 21:06.865
Well, then...

21:06.865 --> 21:08.867
To Poppy.
To Regan.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.344
I think we're going
to need two more here.
