00:02.536 --> 00:04.370
Schmidt? Schmidt.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.938
Nah, it's me.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.340
Easier to clean
myself off this way.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.109
Aly told me
she loved me last night.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.677
Then she yakked on my pants,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.479
and then I yakked on my pants.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.546
I picked the wrong day

00:14.548 --> 00:16.148
to start cuffing my pants.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.549
(laughing)

00:17.551 --> 00:19.685
Yeah, she ain't going
to make it to the wedding.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.287
Have you seen Schmidt? This
is very important. What?

00:22.289 --> 00:24.823
The best man has lost the groom,
or something?

00:24.825 --> 00:27.126
In what world
would that happen in?

00:27.128 --> 00:28.627
In what world?

00:28.629 --> 00:31.163
In what world
would that happen in?

00:31.165 --> 00:33.465
It's one thing for Sam to dump
me on your wedding day,

00:33.467 --> 00:34.867
but then to be like,

00:34.869 --> 00:36.735
"You have feelings for Nick."

00:36.737 --> 00:39.171
Yeah, nice diagnosis, Dr. Dick.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.673
Is he that off-base?
Yes.

00:41.675 --> 00:42.975
Now, we're not
devoting any more

00:42.977 --> 00:44.476
of your wedding day
to this subject.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.178
(over walkie-talkie) Nick for Jess.
Incoming knocking.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.446
Jess, have you seen...

00:48.649 --> 00:51.016
...uh, uh, cherries?

00:51.018 --> 00:53.585
I'm so confused
by your question,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.654
that I'm just going
to answer it, uh, directly.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.156
Yes, I've seen them.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.924
Hmm...

00:58.926 --> 01:01.760
but have you seen the cherry
that I'm talking about?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.062
What do you mean?

01:03.064 --> 01:04.997
I... the... I was with it,

01:04.999 --> 01:07.066
and then the cherry's gone.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.133
(phone rings)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.837
This is cherries.
This is cherries.

01:11.839 --> 01:12.905
Yes!

01:12.907 --> 01:14.840
Yeah, I'm counting down
the minutes

01:14.842 --> 01:16.508
till I can get
in that guy's pants.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.843
(laughs softly)

01:17.845 --> 01:21.080
Ah. Thank God, Schmidt.
Where are you?

01:21.082 --> 01:23.282
I'm flying to Portland
to try to get Cece's mom

01:23.284 --> 01:24.683
to come to the wedding.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.951
Hold on, one second, okay?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.219
No!

01:27.221 --> 01:28.754
It was my job.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.856
You still there?

01:34.361 --> 01:35.427
I-I don't know
if you remember this,

01:35.429 --> 01:37.096
but w-we have plans today.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.864
It'll be fine, okay?
I have return tickets

01:38.866 --> 01:40.365
for 1:00, 2:00 and 3:00 p.m.

01:40.367 --> 01:44.103

no-frills, disgusting airline.

01:44.105 --> 01:47.106
Tray tables, $12.
Cece is crushed

01:47.108 --> 01:48.807
that her mom is not coming,
and I can't take a vow

01:48.809 --> 01:50.609
that all I care about
is her happiness

01:50.611 --> 01:52.077
and not try to do
something about it.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.445
I know you're a terrible liar,

01:53.447 --> 01:54.980
but I need you to lie to Cece.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.949
You can handle this, Nick.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.084
Schmidt's on a plane?! You said
you weren't going to yell.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.121
You said, and I quote,
"It's no biggie."

02:02.123 --> 02:03.489
Hey, um, I think

02:03.491 --> 02:04.990
I did something wrong
with my bangs.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.125
I'll be right there.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.426
So will Schmidt.
Oh, my God.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.961
What?
Uh, no, he won't.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.829
It's bad luck for the bride
to see the groom

02:10.831 --> 02:12.164
on the wedding day, Nick. Uh,
that's just dumb superstition.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.398
He'll be right in.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.000
Cece. Two minutes.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.768
Okay, I'm timing you.
(door closes)

02:16.770 --> 02:18.137
I need you to pull it together,

02:18.139 --> 02:19.404
and just say something simple.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.639
Schmidt's asleep.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.508
Schmidt is<i> asleep. </i>
That's...

02:22.510 --> 02:24.443
Schmidt's asl... What-what
rhythm are we doing?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.978
The normal human rhythm.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.179
Okay. Schmidt is<i> asleep.</i>

02:27.181 --> 02:28.514
<i> Schmidt</i> is asleep.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.582
Nick.
Did I say it, or no?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.583
You said it,
But it wasn't right.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.784
but it sounded very weird.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.119
But it wasn't right.
Just say it like

02:34.121 --> 02:35.120
all one. In all one.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.122
Yeah, Schmidt<i> is</i> asleep.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.323
You could just say, Schmidt's asleep.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.758
<i> Schmidt's</i> asleep. Got it.

No, you're putting
weird emphasis

on weird syllables.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.996
You do it.
Schmidt's asleep.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.497
Hey, Cece,
Schmidt's sleeping, slip.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.100
I'm so nervous, I'm
going to screw this up.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.434
You're always

02:49.436 --> 02:51.837
so ready to believe
the worst in yourself,

02:51.839 --> 02:54.039
and right now, I need you
to believe the best, okay?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.441
I just need you
to tell one lie.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.644
Okay.
I believe in you.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.713

COACH:
Yo, Winnie.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.054
Hey.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.989
How you going to prank
the wedding, bro?

03:10.991 --> 03:13.559
You always prank weddings,
that's what you do.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.494
You've never gone along
with one of my pranks before.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.162
This is exciting.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.072
Coach, I've lived many lives.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.507
The Winston that
you used to know

03:28.509 --> 03:30.008
is gone.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.077
A few hours ago,
Aly told me she loves me,

03:32.079 --> 03:33.912
and that made me a serious man,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.647
in a serious relationship.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.015
The Winston Bishop

03:37.017 --> 03:38.417
that you see here today

03:38.419 --> 03:41.086
is about one thing
and one thing only:

03:41.088 --> 03:43.388
and that is
organizational excellence.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.556
You forgot to make an aisle.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.660
Aw, shoot.

Schmidt is asleep.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.439
Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.873
I know, I'm an
incredible liar.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.775
Yeah, pace yourself,
'cause that was one lie.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.711
We're going to need
about 40 more.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.878
Or one big one.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.014
Okay, we tell Cece
we're giving her

04:09.016 --> 04:10.682
a bridal vitamin,

04:10.684 --> 04:13.085
but secretly we give her
a sleeping pill

04:13.087 --> 04:14.953
that we take from Dr. Sam.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.256
(sighs)

04:17.258 --> 04:20.125
Dr. Sam dumped me. Last night.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.193
He was in love

04:21.195 --> 04:22.928
with his best friend, so.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.930
Predictable.
(laughs nervously)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.265
He's out of his mind.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.532
Thanks.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.734
You okay?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.103
Yeah.
Yeah.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.238
Ah, so we're both going solo
to the wedding.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.773
Yeah.
We're both

04:34.775 --> 04:35.907
going drag.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.876
I think it's stag.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.911
Hmm?
Never mind.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.114
Let's go together.
For old times' sake.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.448
Let's go together.
Have some fun.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.483
You're going to need
someone to dance with.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.584
You know I'm a good dancer.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.752
Okay, but I'm not dancing

04:46.754 --> 04:47.919
to "Single Ladies."
All right.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.121
We won't dance to
"Single Ladies."

04:49.123 --> 04:52.157
Okay. I might dance
to "Single Ladies."

04:53.260 --> 04:54.960
Hey, guys.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.261

05:10.010 --> 05:12.010
You asked me to be
your date to the wedding,

bathroom's still the bathroom,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.419

Oh, I know.
He texts me every day.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.356

calling me from the sky?

05:24.358 --> 05:25.524
This Chinatown bus

05:25.526 --> 05:26.958
doesn't have a sky-phone,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.960
or working landing gear,
apparently.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.330
They said we're going to be
stuck on the tarmac for hours.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.798
You're screaming in my ear.
That's motherhood, lady.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.932
Get used to it.

I love you so much.
This is why I'm marrying you,

This is the happiest day
of my life.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.860
It's also so dumb.
So dumb.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.994
Like, so dumb.
Just the dumbest.

all your clothes off

06:04.498 --> 06:06.198

06:09.403 --> 06:11.036

Great, look at this.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.945
What is that, a towel?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.580
I think it's a pashmina.
"Pashomina"?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.581
Pashmina.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.383
I'm sorry, I just can't
believe you came.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.584
I did.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.052
Things I'm feeling:

07:34.054 --> 07:35.053
excited.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.489
Number two: scared.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.990
I mean, are we gonna do this?
You and me?

07:38.992 --> 07:39.958
Take it home.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.992
Take it to the mat.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.927
I don't know what that means.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.396
You know, like, the big "R."

07:45.999 --> 07:48.166
Oh, a relationship?

07:51.338 --> 07:52.737
No.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.139
(laughs)
No, no.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.441
No. See when I say,
The big "R,"

07:56.443 --> 07:58.510
I'm, of course,
talking about, uh,

07:58.512 --> 08:00.979
rasslin'.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.914
Yeah, I think
that's a "W," "W-R."

08:02.916 --> 08:06.485
Do you ever feel, deep down,
that you know at some point

08:06.487 --> 08:09.020
you're gonna have a stroke
and it's gonna be really bad?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.655
Jess...

08:10.657 --> 08:12.858
I have some Honduran
matrimony beads for my son.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.493
Where's Schmidt?

08:14.495 --> 08:15.794
JESS (whispering):
Winston.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.195
Winston.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.498
I cannot believe
I'm asking this...

08:19.500 --> 08:22.701
but I need you
to prank this wedding.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.869
Please.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.103
Please, we need

08:25.105 --> 08:26.104
to distract people.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.205
He's a serious
man now.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.206
He doesn't
prank anymore.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.875
Just look at his eyes.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.109
All the mischief's gone.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.712
If this were another
time, another day,

08:33.714 --> 08:35.113
hell, even six hours ago...

08:35.115 --> 08:37.983
Listen to me,
you bird-shirted, puzzle baby.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.718
You get out there

08:39.720 --> 08:42.654
and you do something totally
idiotic right now!

08:42.656 --> 08:44.556
(May and Coach laugh)

08:44.558 --> 08:46.291
Funston, we have a pranklem.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.359
(laughs)

08:47.361 --> 08:48.360
I'm not good at these.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.361
It's a weird one.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.030
Okay... update.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.064
The vibe's getting ugly.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.066
People are getting
dangerously drunk.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.002
I found a loose EpiPen on the
floor, which can't be good.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.570
I think we're gonna
have to start telling

08:58.572 --> 09:00.372
people that Schmidt's...
on a plane.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.141
Or not.
Don't freak out.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.876
Mom?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.778
Schmidt's on a plane?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.184
Mom, what are
you doing here?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.386
If you've come to object
to this wedding,

09:14.388 --> 09:15.487
you are too late,

09:15.489 --> 09:16.922
and in another sense,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.356
because it's delayed,

09:18.358 --> 09:21.092
you're... too early.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.127
That's not at all why I'm here.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.696
SCHMIDT: Mama P.
Schmidt with the latest,

09:24.698 --> 09:26.531
"Why I Love Cece."
Today's episode:

09:26.533 --> 09:27.899
Honesty with a Capital

09:27.901 --> 09:29.901
Ouch.
He called you?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.103
Every Monday for the past year.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.908
(beeps) Your daughter
is the best thing...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.044
(beeps) I just lost a fight
in the desert, but...

09:39.046 --> 09:40.845
(beeps) And I want her to
be the last thing I see

09:40.847 --> 09:41.880
when she pulls the plug.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.882
(beeps)
But it's not an A-plus

09:43.884 --> 09:44.950
unless we both finish.
(beeps)

09:44.952 --> 09:46.401
She's so beautiful.

09:46.402 --> 09:47.851
The odds are really stacked
against our children.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.404
They're not all winners.

09:49.405 --> 09:50.955
(beeps) I just know that if you
miss your daughter's wedding,

09:50.958 --> 09:53.692
you're going to regret it
for the rest of your life.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.260
I am delighted

09:55.262 --> 09:57.028
for you to marry this man.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.266
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: For those
keeping score with row five,

10:01.268 --> 10:03.368
Cece's mom is at the wedding!

10:03.370 --> 10:06.771
(cheering, laughter)

10:06.773 --> 10:08.139
(cheering continues)

10:10.277 --> 10:11.977
Just get here
when you can, okay?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.845
We'll wait until you do.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.482
You know what?
Have the party without me.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.984
Babe.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.485
No. Okay, no.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.120
Have the party. We'll...

10:22.122 --> 10:24.723
We'll get married at City Hall
with all the immigrants

10:24.725 --> 10:26.791
and liberals and first cousins.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.094
Your whole life has been
about this party.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.129
My whole life is you.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.732
Plus, my cousin Nathan is just
dying for something to go wrong.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.667
I'm so happy.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.328
When I first met this guy,

12:10.330 --> 12:15.667
Schmidt, I thought, "I'm not
gonna be friends with him.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.169
I don't like his personality."

think about something,

12:27.047 --> 12:28.847

12:28.849 --> 12:30.415
In a couple generations,

12:30.417 --> 12:31.883
we're all gonna be dead,

12:31.885 --> 12:33.118
and no one's gonna remember
any of us.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.285
I mean, think about it.
Do you remember

12:34.287 --> 12:37.055
your great-great
grandparents or...

12:37.057 --> 12:38.857
or their parents,
or what they did day to day?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.358
The point is, it doesn't matter.

12:40.360 --> 12:45.130
Everyone you know will be dead.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.231
That's right.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.532
Congratulations, man.
I love you.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.867
Best friends.

Thank you.

it wouldn't be my wedding.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.107
Your speech
wasn't that bad.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.408
My speech was fantastic.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.077
It's the best
17 minutes of my life.

I was gonna say.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.915
Nah, I'm just feeling
bad about Reagan.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.217
I think I came on
too strong, or-or...

13:06.219 --> 13:08.920
I don't know. She told me she's
leaving tonight on a train.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.055
On a train?
Where's she going, Hogwarts?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.257
No, San Diego.

I don't know if "Hog-warts"
is near San Diego.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.394
I've never heard of it.
Never mind.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.930
But, I mean, it's okay. I just,
I feel like I, you know...

13:18.932 --> 13:20.098
I just got excited
for a second.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.935
Nick, she came here
to see you.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.137
I bet you're reading into it.
What if I go talk to her?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.972
Talk me up a little bit?

13:27.974 --> 13:30.642
Woman to woman?
That's implied.

Give me those.
That's a fatty. You got a fatty.

This is not Winnie's day.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.960

your jacket.

Give me the damn jacket.

Tie it around your waist.

Then that leaves the
front porch open or the back.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.371

this is gonna work.
