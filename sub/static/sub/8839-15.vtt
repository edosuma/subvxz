SO EXCITED ABOUT?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.757
YOU SEE WHAT HE DONE?

02:55.925 --> 02:58.177
THE LITTLE VARMINT

02:58.344 --> 03:01.180
SO? A NEW CANE
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET,

03:01.347 --> 03:03.974
BUT THE LITTLE BOY,
YOU'RE FRIGHTENING HIM.

PLEASE, LET HIM GO.
EVEN THE HOLY BOOK SAY,

03:20.158 --> 03:24.119
"IF YOU MUST BEAT A
CHILD, USE A STRING."

03:27.874 --> 03:29.583

WHAT'S THE MATTER,
NELS? DIDN'T YOU
THINK THAT WAS FUNNY?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.291
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT OLD ISAAC

04:11.459 --> 04:13.377
DOES THE BEST
WOODWORK IN
HERO TOWNSHIP.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.379
THERE'S
NOBODY THAT
CAN TOUCH HIM.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.714
WELL, HOWEVER,
MR. LARRABEE,

04:17.882 --> 04:19.758
THE ONLY REASON THAT
WE LET THE OLD JEW

04:19.926 --> 04:21.176
INTO THE STORE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

04:21.344 --> 04:24.763
IS BECAUSE HE DOES
MAKE VERY GOOD COFFINS,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.723
AND WE DO STOCK COFFINS.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.394

THAT YOU SHOULD
EVER NEED ONE.

REALLY?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.473
WHAT DOES IT
SAY ABOUT HER?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.141
WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

05:51.309 --> 05:53.810
IT SAYS SHE'S AN
ATTRACTIVE GIRL

05:53.978 --> 05:55.687
FROM A GOOD FAMILY.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.274

11:50.710 --> 11:53.002

MANY DIFFERENT KINDS.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.423

NEVER BE ASHAMED OF
ANY WORK YOU'VE DONE.

HOW TO MAKE STUFF.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.358
YOU KNOW, I, UH...

12:57.526 --> 13:01.446
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HIRING A NEW APPRENTICE.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.283
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN WORKING WITH ME?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.410
OH, YOU
BET I WOULD!

13:07.578 --> 13:10.497
BUT I'D HAVE TO ASK
MY PA'S PERMISSION.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.415
ASK HIM!

13:12.583 --> 13:14.834

13:35.356 --> 13:37.148
SURE.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.692
WELL, MR. SINGERMAN
ASKED ME TO BE
HIS APPRENTICE,

13:39.860 --> 13:42.570
AND I'D LIKE YOUR
PERMISSION TO WORK
WITH HIM AFTER SCHOOL

13:42.738 --> 13:45.156
INSTEAD OF
DOING CHORES.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.075
ARE YOU SURE YOU
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING INTO?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.911
BEING AN APPRENTICE
TO A CRAFTSMAN, THAT'S
PRETTY SERIOUS BUSINESS.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.831
I KNOW, BUT
I STILL WANT
TO DO IT.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.415
HOW COME THIS SUDDEN
INTEREST IN WOODWORK?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.334
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PRETTY SET ON
BEING A FARMER.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.462
WELL, I AM,
I JUST...

13:59.630 --> 14:02.715
JUST THOUGHT IT
WOULDN'T BE BAD TO
LEARN ANOTHER TRADE.

14:02.883 --> 14:03.967
THAT'S
GOOD THINKING.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.552
YOU COULDN'T LEARN
FROM A BETTER MAN.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.928
YEAH, I KNOW.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.597
AND, WELL, WITH
HIS SON GOING BACK
EAST AND ALL,

14:09.765 --> 14:10.807
I KIND OF
THOUGHT THAT--

14:10.975 --> 14:12.350

HE MIGHT BE YEARNING

14:12.518 --> 14:14.435
FOR SOME COMPANY
FOR A WHILE.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.104
YEAH.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.398
THERE'S
JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM, PA.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.774
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN DO IT,

14:19.942 --> 14:21.526
BUT I DON'T WANT
YOUR HOMEWORK
SUFFERING.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.444
OH, IT WON'T,
THANKS, PA!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.238
OKAY.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.002

MR. BROWER.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.628
Mr. Brower:
GOOD MORNING.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.177
HOW'S EVERYTHING
BY YOU, MR. BROWER?

14:48.345 --> 14:50.346
FINE, STILL
BREATHING, YOU?

14:50.514 --> 14:51.723
JUST FINE.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.601
HEARD THAT KID
OF YOUR'N RAN OFF
TO NEW YORK CITY.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.728
AH, HE DIDN'T
EXACTLY RUN OFF.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.062
HE WENT TO
GET MARRIED.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.691
I KNOW THAT STORY, RAISED
5 YOUNG'UNS MYSELF.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.444
AND NOT ONE OF THEM
EVER COMES TO SEE ME.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.905
IN OUR VILLAGE,
THERE IS A SAYING.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.241
ONE FATHER CAN
SUPPORT 10 CHILDREN.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.035
10 CHILDREN...

15:12.202 --> 15:13.870
CAN SUPPORT ONE FATHER.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.748
AMEN TO THAT, BROTHER.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.541
MR. BROWER,

15:18.709 --> 15:21.336
I NOTICE YOU HAVE
AN EXTRA BUCKET...

15:23.213 --> 15:25.632
AND I NEED ONE
VERY BADLY.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.801
WOULD BE WILLING
TO TRADE FOR
THIS CANE?

15:38.354 --> 15:42.231
WORKMANSHIP AIN'T BAD.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.734
YOU SAY YOU WANT TO
MAKE AN EVEN SWAP?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.945
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.529
Mr. Brower: GUESS
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.948
OK, IT'S A DEAL.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.117
Mr. Singerman:
THANK YOU, MR.
BROWER, AND BE WELL.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.453
Mr. Brower:
THE SAME TO YOU.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.871
Albert: I DON'T GET IT.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.290
HOW COME YOU TRADED HIM
THAT GREAT WALKING STICK

15:59.458 --> 16:00.583
FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.919
Mr. Singerman:
HEH HEH, ALBERT,

16:03.087 --> 16:05.630
THERE'S A JEWISH
WORD, RACHMONES.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.341
IT MEANS IN ENGLISH
"COMPASSION."

16:08.509 --> 16:12.387
LIFE WITHOUT RACHMONES
IS NOT WORTH LIVING.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.763
HE'S A POOR MAN.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.683
HE NEEDS A NEW
WALKING STICK.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.935
Albert: THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST GIVE IT TO HIM?

16:19.103 --> 16:21.229
WHY TRADE IT FOR
A RUSTY OLD BUCKET?

16:21.397 --> 16:24.774
Mr. Singerman: BECAUSE
OUR FAITH SAYS WHEN
YOU GIVE CHARITY,

16:24.942 --> 16:28.569
YOU MUST GIVE SO
THE PERSON RECEIVING
THE CHARITY

16:28.737 --> 16:30.363
FEELS NO SHAME.
