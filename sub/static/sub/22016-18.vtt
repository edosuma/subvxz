WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.130
How we doin'?

00:04.200 --> 00:06.300
It's the most stressful day of the year

00:06.370 --> 00:07.670
for Claire...

00:07.740 --> 00:08.740
our anniversary.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.240
She tends to leave her gift shopping
till the last minute,

00:11.310 --> 00:12.870
and the pressure can really get to her.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.440
I'm great.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.880
Huh.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.010
- Oh, did you forget it's our...
- No.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.510
Happy Anniversary.

00:22.580 --> 00:23.650
You're strangely calm.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.590
Is this the legendary
realm beyond madness?

00:25.650 --> 00:27.650
I already got your gift.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.190
And I nailed it.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.590
I even stayed below the $100 limit.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.190
- You?
- Oh, you'll be quite pleased.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.990
Once I find something.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.630
This time I left my shopping
till the last minute,

00:37.700 --> 00:40.030
maybe just to give Claire
a chance at our competition.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.730
Am I too competitive?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.900
I mean, she does often say,

00:43.970 --> 00:47.210
"Phil, do you always
have to finish first?"

00:47.280 --> 00:49.840
Joe, I'm coming for you.

00:49.910 --> 00:52.150
Hey, have you guys seen Joe?

00:52.210 --> 00:54.050
Aw, man!

00:54.120 --> 00:56.380
You found me so easy.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.150
But that was for fun.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.550
Hide and seek?

00:59.620 --> 01:01.020
What am I, 4?

01:01.090 --> 01:04.220
I'm here because Luke has
the new zombie video game

01:04.290 --> 01:06.060
that my mom would never let me play.

01:06.130 --> 01:09.130
So... what else? What else?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.060
Hey, didn't you get a new video game?

01:11.130 --> 01:12.800
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

01:12.870 --> 01:14.600
- Did you see her yesterday?
- No, why?

01:14.670 --> 01:16.070
That's what she says when she realizes

01:16.140 --> 01:17.500
she just slept through an entire day.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.940
So, my boss went away for the weekend,

01:19.010 --> 01:20.510
and I realized I left my phone
at her house.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.680
There's a doggy door,
but then I would have to find a dog,

01:22.740 --> 01:25.080
somehow learn how train it
to go inside, and then find it.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.110
- And I don't know where to get a...
- Honey...

01:27.850 --> 01:29.490
Oh my God, duh.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.120
Joe, you have a dog.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.850
Come on.

01:41.430 --> 01:46.430

01:50.410 --> 01:52.870
Now see, this is when
entertainment was classy.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.470
Max Feldman wore a tux,

01:54.540 --> 01:56.280
the audience smoked cigars.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.210
And his act is as fresh today
as it was in the '70s.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.680
<i>What are you, an Eskimo?</i>

02:00.750 --> 02:02.020
<i>You got 50 words for "snow,"</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:04.480
<i>but apparently none for "toothbrush."</i>

02:05.920 --> 02:08.990
I don't understand
why you guys like that man.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.060
He's a bully.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.290
See, this is why we're not bringing you
to his show tonight.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.530
You don't get the jokes,

02:13.600 --> 02:14.930
you ask questions the whole time...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.300
It ruins the experience.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.830
I understand funny jokes.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.730
This is not funny. This is mean.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.070
He just told that guy

02:21.140 --> 02:23.940
that he looked like
a beef jerky wearing a tuxedo.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.510
And that guy was Ronald Reagan
and he loved it!

02:26.570 --> 02:28.340
I hope Feldman zetzes me tonight.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.640
- Is that why you're wearing that shirt?
- Huh? No.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.880
Anyways, I'm gonna go
and run some errands.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.610
If Jorge arrives before I'm back,

02:34.680 --> 02:36.580
please don't bore him with this stuff.

02:36.650 --> 02:39.550
Jorge was this steamy Latin musician
your mother used to date.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.750
Apparently she feels
she has to invite him here,

02:41.820 --> 02:43.390
instead of just thinking about him

02:43.460 --> 02:45.430
while she pages through
a high-school yearbook

02:45.490 --> 02:48.230
on her third Scotch
like a normal person.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.600
Jay, don't be jealous.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.960
It was 20 years ago,

02:51.030 --> 02:53.270
and I only dated him for six months.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.570
And we never had what you and I have.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.590
Well, that's nice to hear.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.700
It was only physical.

02:59.670 --> 03:01.670
Manny...

03:01.740 --> 03:03.540
you're gonna learn something today.

03:03.610 --> 03:05.240
I try to learn something every day.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.910
It keeps me young,
or nuori, as they say in Finnish.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.980
Assuming you stop
saying stuff like that,

03:10.050 --> 03:11.480
one day you will be married,

03:11.550 --> 03:13.290
and eventually the ex will show up

03:13.360 --> 03:14.450
sniffing around,

03:14.520 --> 03:16.720
puffing out his pretty-boy chest,

03:16.790 --> 03:18.590
which is your cue to go alpha.

03:18.660 --> 03:19.990
Don't you think Mom will get annoyed

03:20.060 --> 03:21.690
when she sees you being rude
to an old friend?

03:21.760 --> 03:22.800
Not at all.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.500
Deep down, she wants to see me vanquish

03:24.570 --> 03:25.630
all who came before.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.230
It's basic animal stuff.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.900
Oh, I get it.

03:28.970 --> 03:31.000
My girlfriend Karen
was pretty frisky the other night

03:31.070 --> 03:32.670
after her ex showed up,
and I bested him

03:32.740 --> 03:34.640
in a chocolate-soufflé bake-off.

03:34.710 --> 03:35.910
I don't need to tell you

03:35.980 --> 03:37.810
my soufflé wasn't
the only sweet brown dish

03:37.880 --> 03:39.150
she devoured that night.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.880
- Because...?
- I also made molasses cookies.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.450
I've learned to ask the second question.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.790
I don't even remember
what the fight was about.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.160
Uh-huh. Then why does your teacher
want to have a chat with us?

03:49.220 --> 03:50.890
- Maybe she has trouble meeting people.
- Ah.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.090
Hey.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.630
Oh, that is a... that's bold.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.960
- It's too young, isn't it?
- No!

03:56.330 --> 03:57.360
Oh god, these things
have lie detectors now.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.530
Sir, please give me your bag.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.430
Oh...we... well, the cashier probably

04:00.500 --> 04:02.740
just forgot to take
a security tag off of the...

04:03.840 --> 04:05.040
Where did that come from?

04:05.110 --> 04:06.610
Possible 488.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.470
No. I wouldn't steal a bra!

04:08.540 --> 04:10.210
I don't wear bras!

04:10.280 --> 04:11.640
Oh. Well, maybe once.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.680
Our friend Pepper had
a "Turning 50 is a Drag" party.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.210
Yeah, he's had five of those.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.350
- So...
- Sir, please come with me.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.579
No... No, no, no, no, no.
Mitchell, call a lawyer!

04:18.649 --> 04:19.649
I'm a lawyer.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.790
Yeah, but you've lost more suits
than a Men's Wearhouse in a tornado.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.220
April Fool's!

04:23.290 --> 04:24.960
They thought you were a shoplifter!

04:25.030 --> 04:27.060
Burn!

04:27.130 --> 04:29.060
A fight at school,
and now a shoplifting prank?

04:29.130 --> 04:30.430
If you wanted to rebel,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.370
why don't you just put
a pink streak in your hair?

04:32.430 --> 04:33.630
I told you, I don't want one.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.870
But you would look so cute.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.120
Okay, well, whatever this phase is,
I'm not a fan.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.020
I blame us.
We've been far too permissive.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.810
Agreed. You are grounded
for one month, Missy!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.210
We got the Cirque du Soleil tickets.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.540
- Except for Cirque du Soleil!
- And the Disneyland trip.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.900
And for Disneyland!
But you are not going to

04:46.930 --> 04:48.700
Christina's slumber party tonight
no matter how much...

04:48.720 --> 04:50.580
- We have reservations at Cactus.
- Okay, Christina's slumber party

04:50.650 --> 04:51.820
is the last one for a while.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.390
Right. That's right.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.960
<i>Scented candles.</i>

05:01.530 --> 05:03.500
The simpleton's choice.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.200
The perfect gift has three elements...
not something you'd buy for yourself,

05:07.270 --> 05:10.400
takes you on an emotional journey,
that journey is on a ship...

05:10.470 --> 05:12.240
A showmanship.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.810
Mm.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.680
I mean, finding a gift
that has all three is challenging,

05:15.740 --> 05:18.180
but here's the thing.
Bad ideas aren't your enemy.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.110
In fact, sometimes if you free-associate

05:20.180 --> 05:22.650
from the bad ideas,
you discover great ones.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.280
Let's try it.

05:24.350 --> 05:26.320
Sir, would you like a bonsai tree?

05:26.390 --> 05:27.450
Novelty key chain.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.990
First thing that popped into the noodle.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.220
It's terrible.
Let's see what that key unlocks.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.230
Novelty key chain. Novelty lock.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.430
Loch Ness Monster. Monster bike.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
Bike lock. Padlock.
Mouse pad. Novelty mouse pad!

05:39.570 --> 05:42.640
Novelty key chain!
What... just... happened?

05:43.670 --> 05:45.540
It was like my muse just disappeared.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.110
<i>And she wasn't coming back.</i>

05:47.180 --> 05:49.440
Soap?! She's not your grandma, Phil!

05:49.510 --> 05:51.710
If I don't care that it
mops, dusts, squeegees,

05:51.780 --> 05:52.850
and lights up,

05:52.910 --> 05:54.380
would I care that Stacey Keach says

05:54.450 --> 05:56.220
it's the last cleaning tool
you'll ever need?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.550
Box of chocolates.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.660
Count Chocula.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.830
Chaka Khan, conman, Isle of Man.

06:05.890 --> 06:07.690
"I Love Lucy," Lucy Liu.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.900
Lululemon, lemon peel.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.600
"Key & Peele," key chain!

06:11.670 --> 06:13.000
Novelty key chain?!

06:13.070 --> 06:15.500
No! No!

06:17.750 --> 06:20.240
- Laundry, right?
- Oh, it never ends.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.810
I heard that.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.350
- Happy Anniversary, by the way.
- Thank you.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.080
Did you get anything special for Phil?

06:26.150 --> 06:27.550
Kid's smooth like butter.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.220
Just like I coached him.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.120
I am very excited
about the present I got for Phil.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.390
Come on over here. Come on closer.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.590
But you have to promise

06:33.660 --> 06:35.290
that you are not gonna tell anybody.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.560
Talk to papa.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.700
I don't want anybody else
to hear what it is.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.430
It's a really good secret.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.800
And the present is...

06:42.870 --> 06:43.970
Ow!

06:44.040 --> 06:45.740
Why would you do that?!

06:45.810 --> 06:48.210
My ears are still developing!

06:48.270 --> 06:50.010
Nice try, Phil.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.280
That's so funny!

06:51.340 --> 06:52.880
Oh. Hey, honey. How are you?

06:52.950 --> 06:54.210
I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.950
Oh, boy.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.650
Hello, Robert...

06:57.720 --> 06:59.380
Not too much. How are you?

06:59.450 --> 07:01.790
There are a lot of ways
you can establish status

07:01.850 --> 07:03.520
over another man, like Jorge.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.790
A firm handshake...

07:06.060 --> 07:07.930
...displays of wealth...

07:07.990 --> 07:09.860
and feats of strength.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.830
Interesting. Moving that rug

07:13.900 --> 07:15.000
was the hardest thing
in the world for you

07:15.070 --> 07:16.270
when I needed to practice tap dancing.

07:16.340 --> 07:18.800
There are also more subtle moves,

07:18.870 --> 07:21.170
what I call micro-aggressions.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.440
Call him by the wrong name.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.640
Throws him off the moment he meets you.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.580
You must be Huevos!

07:27.650 --> 07:29.380
Jay! Pleasure.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.550
Jorge de la Selva.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.750
In English, it's George of the Jungle,

07:31.820 --> 07:33.420
so I stick with Spanish.

07:33.490 --> 07:35.650
- Hey, who's got the great taste?
- That would be me!

07:35.720 --> 07:36.920
Nice!

07:36.990 --> 07:38.590
Uh, hello...

07:38.660 --> 07:42.390
So, you and Gloria... you used to, uh...

07:42.460 --> 07:43.890
Yep.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.930
Hey, so he was a little more handsome

07:48.000 --> 07:49.230
than you were expecting,

07:49.300 --> 07:51.440
but pull yourself together, man.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.370
Now, fights are very common
at Lily's age.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.740
I mean, so many parents ask me,

07:55.810 --> 07:57.370
"What happened to my sweet little kid,"

07:57.440 --> 07:59.240
and I say, "that's puberty."

07:59.310 --> 08:00.510
Puberty?

08:00.580 --> 08:01.750
Well, Lily's a little young
for that, so...

08:01.810 --> 08:04.220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What is this? The inner ear?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.450
That is the female reproductive system.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.620
- Oh.
- Cam.

08:07.690 --> 08:09.590
Oops. Heh. I dropped the, uh...

08:09.660 --> 08:10.990
I want to say egg chute,

08:11.060 --> 08:13.190
but I know it's probably
something more Latin-y.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.490
It can be a challenge

08:14.560 --> 08:16.630
when a child enters into adolescence,

08:16.700 --> 08:17.800
so I was thinking...

08:17.860 --> 08:19.230
does Lily have any aunts

08:19.300 --> 08:21.500
or any other female figures in her life?

08:21.570 --> 08:22.600
Yes, why?

08:22.670 --> 08:23.870
Well, she might want to talk to a woman

08:23.900 --> 08:24.900
about what she's going through.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.070
Okay. I see.
So meaning, as a gay couple,

08:27.140 --> 08:29.670
we're not up to the task
of raising a daughter on our own.

08:29.740 --> 08:30.770
- No...
- Okay.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.940
Mitchell, I'm stuck.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.179
I'm just saying that
Lily may be self-conscious

08:34.250 --> 08:36.150
talking to men... even her dads...

08:36.220 --> 08:39.179
about certain female body issues.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.419
Did she tell you
what the fight was about?

08:42.490 --> 08:45.360
- Yes. Obviously.
- Yes, we are a very open family.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.960
It's not like we wouldn't
just not follow up.

08:48.030 --> 08:49.060
And what did she tell you?

08:49.130 --> 08:51.030
- Uh, that... a boy..?
- A...

08:51.100 --> 08:52.100
- No.
- Girl.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.400
A girl tried to snap Lily's...

08:53.470 --> 08:54.870
- Finger!
- Bra.

08:54.930 --> 08:57.000
- But Lily doesn't have a bra.
- Exactly.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.470
And now she's getting teased,

08:58.540 --> 09:00.700
because unlike the other girls,
she doesn't have a...

09:00.770 --> 09:03.410
- Oh, just say it. A mom.
- A bra.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.510
- Oh.
- Okay, so...

09:04.580 --> 09:07.080
Oh, that wasn't a joke when she
stuffed that bra in your bag.

09:07.150 --> 09:09.210
She wants one. She's just...

09:09.280 --> 09:10.580
she was too embarrassed
to ask for it.

09:11.690 --> 09:12.850
Oh, boy.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.320
You don't think this is gon...
gonna come up

09:14.390 --> 09:15.850
at the slumber party, do you?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.550
Not Christina S's slumber party?

09:17.620 --> 09:18.860
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

09:18.930 --> 09:22.030
She single handedly sent
our lunch lady back to rehab.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.960
I would strongly consider
bringing Lily...

09:24.030 --> 09:25.330
Thank you, we got it.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.560
Mm.

09:26.630 --> 09:27.770
Obviously you were gonna say

09:27.830 --> 09:30.670
we should bring Lily... home?

09:30.740 --> 09:33.170
Actually, I was going to say
bring Lily a training...bra.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.010
- Training bra!
- A train set! Bra.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.210
See? We all said training bra
at the same time.

09:40.150 --> 09:42.410
Oh, wow. This crema is incredible.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.780
The secret is Amore beans
from Guatemala.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.150
Low-acid, shade-grown,

09:46.220 --> 09:48.890
individually massaged
by an order of hill nuns.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.420
Oh, I'm very familiar
with the Amore bean.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.520
I get why you have trouble

09:52.590 --> 09:53.590
vanquishing this guy.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.060
He's perfect. So, Jorge, um,

09:56.130 --> 09:58.900
you were Gloria's boyfriend
right before Javier?

09:58.970 --> 10:00.600
Yeah, and a little during, you know?

10:00.670 --> 10:02.200
She kinda bounced around
between the two of us.

10:02.270 --> 10:04.230
Um, where is she anyway?

10:04.300 --> 10:05.770
I got to be at a Dodger game in an hour.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.300
Oh, you like sports?

10:07.370 --> 10:08.810
That's fantastic!

10:08.870 --> 10:11.380
I tried to get this one into baseball.
No go.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.340
Actually, I hate baseball.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.780
I'm here to sing the national anthem.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.410
I'm an opera singer.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.080
I just finished two months at La Scala.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.280
The house that Toscanini built?!

10:20.350 --> 10:21.790
Yeah, well, it's been rebuilt
a few times.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.890
You know, a bunch of opera
singers prancing around.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.620
It, uh, takes its toll
on the foundation.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.190
- Yeah.
- Hey.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.230
I'm here to pick up Mom's old boombox
from storage?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.660
She needs it for...

10:32.300 --> 10:34.260
How many Mannys do you see
through these things?

10:34.330 --> 10:36.200
That's Gloria's ex-boyfriend.

10:36.270 --> 10:37.700
Wait, how far ex?

10:37.770 --> 10:40.240
Roughly 20 years.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.510
Oh, my God.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.010
Is... Is it possible?
What does Gloria say?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.310
She hasn't even seen him yet.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.480
The odd bit is,

10:45.540 --> 10:47.110
these two clones
don't see the resemblance.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.610
Maybe she won't either?
I'm not gonna force it on her.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.050
I mean, it's no easy thing to say

10:51.120 --> 10:52.580
"Is there a chance you're so dumb

10:52.650 --> 10:54.350
you don't even know
who the father of your baby is?"

10:54.420 --> 10:57.760
We could do a DNA test.
I could do one at the lab at school.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.490
And then you would have
a definitive answer.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.720
If it comes back negative,

11:00.790 --> 11:02.360
mm, you don't even really
have to tell Gloria.

11:02.430 --> 11:03.690
Well, what do you need, saliva?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.200
We take these two down to the Sizzler,

11:05.260 --> 11:07.300
and you squeegee what you need
off the salad-bar window?

11:07.370 --> 11:08.900
They use hairs now!

11:11.030 --> 11:14.090
"But we hanged Wichita Willy
yesterday," said the sheriff.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.300
"Could he be back for revenge?"

11:16.360 --> 11:17.700
That's when they looked up

11:17.760 --> 11:19.870
and there was Wichita Willy,

11:19.930 --> 11:21.730
the noose still dangling from his neck.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.440
Hey, sweetie. What you guys doing?

11:29.510 --> 11:31.010
Have you heard of Twice Hung Willy?

11:31.080 --> 11:33.450
Um, yes, I'm familiar
with his films, but...

11:33.510 --> 11:34.650
What are you doing here?

11:34.720 --> 11:35.780
There's something
we forgot to pack for you.

11:35.850 --> 11:36.980
Can... can I talk to you for a second?

11:37.050 --> 11:39.680
- No. It's girls only.
- Yeah, no, but you're gonna love it.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.990
What is it?

11:41.050 --> 11:42.890
Oh, it's not for you, Christina.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.090
- Uh...
- Oh, God.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.790
Lily...?

11:45.860 --> 11:47.990
Why does your dad have a fallopian tube?

11:48.060 --> 11:49.390
- That's what it is.
- Oh.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.730
What's wrong with you?!

11:50.800 --> 11:52.660
Calm down, okay?
Your father was fiddling

11:52.730 --> 11:54.030
with your teacher's reproductive organ.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.730
Oh, my God! Ms. Wolfe?!

11:55.800 --> 11:57.300
No, ju... the model on her desk.

11:57.370 --> 11:58.940
And then he put his finger into it,

11:59.010 --> 12:00.340
and then he couldn't...

12:00.410 --> 12:01.740
- Well, now mine's stuck!
- Okay, let me...

12:01.810 --> 12:02.940
- Okay, this is tight.
- Push your finger through.

12:03.010 --> 12:04.380
Oh, no.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.640
- Are they like this in real life?
- I don't think so.

12:05.710 --> 12:07.150
This is gross!

12:07.210 --> 12:08.350
No. It's not gross, okay?

12:08.420 --> 12:10.020
Nothing about your body is gross to us.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.980
Yes. Not your cycles, not your fluids...

12:12.050 --> 12:15.490
Oh my God, just stop talking forever.
Just go!

12:16.590 --> 12:19.160
Oh, well, that was a disaster.

12:19.230 --> 12:21.130
You know, maybe it's just time
we start to admit

12:21.190 --> 12:22.530
that straight couples have strengths

12:22.600 --> 12:24.260
that we don't, you know?

12:24.330 --> 12:27.300
And maybe moms know
more about girls than we do.

12:27.370 --> 12:28.970
Is it time to start
farming some of this girl stuff out?

12:29.040 --> 12:31.540
Yeah, but to who?
Claire's an over-sharer.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.710
Gloria... is her body even human?

12:33.770 --> 12:35.570
Haley knows less than Lily.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.580
- So who do we go to? Alex?
- I guess.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.810
I mean, it'll be dull,
but it'll be right.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.480
- Let's prank call Milo again.
- You totally like him.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.880
I do not! I just want to torture him.

12:44.950 --> 12:46.550
Okay...so, see, are we supposed to hear
something like that

12:46.620 --> 12:47.790
- and say nothing?
- Yes, we are.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.920
- Come on.
- Okay, hi.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.320
If you want to get a boy's attention,

12:50.390 --> 12:52.860
you know, a prank call
is probably not the move.

12:52.930 --> 12:53.960
Dad!

12:54.030 --> 12:55.860
Cam, this is not our place.
But, he's not wrong.

12:55.930 --> 12:57.230
I just like to make him mad!

12:57.300 --> 12:58.600
Yeah, well,
we just thought you liked him

12:58.670 --> 13:00.700
and you wanted to know
the best way to get his attention,

13:00.770 --> 13:03.170
but apparently not.
So good night.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.750
Wait!

13:04.790 --> 13:07.580
Okay. Okay, so,
who's Milo's best friend?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.320
- Barrett.
- Okay, you're gonna text Milo,

13:09.340 --> 13:12.810
"You're hilarious! Crying-laughing face,
and winky face emoji."

13:12.880 --> 13:15.180
Then wait a beat.
Then you're gonna text back,

13:15.250 --> 13:16.680
"Oops, sorry. That was for Barrett.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.850
Neutral-face emoji
with straight-line mouth."

13:18.920 --> 13:21.750
Oh my God. Genius.

13:21.820 --> 13:23.620
Wow, I've never seen her smile.

13:23.690 --> 13:24.890
Dudes!

13:24.960 --> 13:26.190
Milo just texted me back.

13:26.260 --> 13:27.430
Okay, what'd he say?

13:27.490 --> 13:30.330
"You're a jerk. Winky eye face
with the tongue hanging out."

13:30.400 --> 13:32.330
- Oh, you're in. You're in.
- Oh! Yeah.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.300
Do not text him back, okay?

13:34.370 --> 13:35.670
But when you see him on Monday,

13:35.740 --> 13:37.440
walk right past him
and throw him a quick...

13:37.500 --> 13:38.570
"Hey."

13:38.640 --> 13:40.540
- Hey.
- Yes!

13:40.610 --> 13:41.740
All right, you girls got it from here.

13:41.810 --> 13:42.870
We have a dinner reservation.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.810
Hey, I saw what you put in the bag.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.940
Thanks.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.680
You're welcome, sweetie.
And we love you.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.610
Are you gonna be this cool
when I like a boy?

13:49.680 --> 13:51.680
- Oh, no. No.
- No. Not a chance.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.220
- Good, you're home.
- One second.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.230
Papi, you look great
in that new shirt!

14:01.290 --> 14:04.460
- So handsome!
- Gloria!

14:04.530 --> 14:06.730
Oh. I thought you were Manny.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.530
Good. You're caught up now.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.870
I know I put on a few,

14:09.940 --> 14:11.640
but they don't take you
seriously as an opera singer

14:11.710 --> 14:13.140
when you're too skinny.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.440
Do you know what happens
when the thin lady sings?

14:15.510 --> 14:16.880
The show just keeps going.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.310
It's so wonderful to see you.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.910
I'm gonna go and open a bottle of wine.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.690
Do you think that Jorge could be...?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.190
Jorge mentioned you bounced around

14:30.260 --> 14:31.320
between him and Javier.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.960
How much bouncing did you do?

14:34.030 --> 14:36.460
Technically, it's possible.

14:36.530 --> 14:37.730
Oh, my God.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.330
- How is Manny going to handle this?
- Not great.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.600
You know he doesn't respond well
to surprises.

14:42.670 --> 14:43.800
Remember how upset he got

14:43.870 --> 14:45.200
when he found out those mashed potatoes

14:45.270 --> 14:46.740
were really just whipped cauliflower?

14:46.810 --> 14:49.240
What are we going to do?

14:49.310 --> 14:51.910
Okay, Grandpa, I got...
Oh, Gloria, you're here.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.580
What do you bring with you,
besides that guilty look?

14:54.650 --> 14:57.280
Okay, in order to get
a definitive answer,

14:57.350 --> 15:00.090
I had Alex perform a DNA test.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.750
You got them both to spit?

15:01.820 --> 15:03.720
- They use hair now.
- Eugh.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.990
Hey, lotion's on the sink, Jorge.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.330
Hey, turns out I'm not the only one

15:07.390 --> 15:10.130
who suffers from dry naval.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.730
Uh, Alex, why do you have a medical form
with my name on it?

15:14.330 --> 15:17.040
I don't think I should be
the one to explain this.

15:20.070 --> 15:21.810
Manny... as you know,

15:21.880 --> 15:24.680
your mother and Jorge
had a relationship.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.880
You're a lot alike,

15:25.950 --> 15:28.250
and it made us curious as to whether...

15:28.320 --> 15:30.480
Uh, are... are you saying...

15:30.550 --> 15:32.050
This is a DNA test.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.550
Your mom didn't even find out
until today.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.290
So... I...

15:37.360 --> 15:40.020
I... I don't even know how to react.

15:40.090 --> 15:42.790
So my whole childhood was a lie?

15:42.860 --> 15:44.300
I thought Javier was my dad.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.400
Now he's just some stranger
who gave me baths?

15:46.470 --> 15:47.970
Listen, buddy.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.830
It's not who brings you into the world.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.440
It's what you do when you're there.

15:51.510 --> 15:52.770
You're not Javier.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.210
You're not this guy. You're you.

15:54.270 --> 15:55.640
And what you are is amazing.

15:55.710 --> 15:58.480
And for the record,
I've been your dad since you were 10,

15:58.550 --> 16:01.580
and I'm gonna be your dad
until I'm gone.

16:01.650 --> 16:04.180
I love you, and I always will.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.480
I love you too, Jay.

16:11.690 --> 16:14.490
Ha! April Fool's!

16:14.560 --> 16:17.700
Now who doesn't understand a joke?!

16:17.760 --> 16:18.830
What?

16:18.900 --> 16:21.200
I never dated Jorge!

16:21.270 --> 16:23.300
He's the butcher at the grocery store!

16:23.370 --> 16:25.640
I just thought
that he looked like Manny!

16:25.710 --> 16:27.940
Why would you do that?

16:28.010 --> 16:31.280
Because you said
that I didn't understand funny.

16:31.340 --> 16:33.210
I didn't know you were going
to take the prank this far.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.650
You made Grandpa cry.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.710
I know! He was like,

16:36.780 --> 16:39.950
"I love you and I always will."

16:42.720 --> 16:43.920
Okay, look, I'm out.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.390
Uh, I used to raise veal,

16:45.460 --> 16:47.560
and this has to be the cruelest thing

16:47.630 --> 16:48.660
I've ever been a part of.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.130
Okay, almost there... almost there...

16:53.200 --> 16:54.230
Hang on. One second.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.730
Claire's gift involved a blindfold

16:56.800 --> 16:58.100
and a second location...

16:58.170 --> 16:59.670
showmanship of the highest order.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.350
To make things worse,
the clock ran out on me.

17:02.390 --> 17:03.440
My gift...

17:04.180 --> 17:05.380
I settled...

17:06.680 --> 17:08.050
I can't even say it out loud.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.220
And...

17:10.280 --> 17:11.380
Ta-da!

17:11.410 --> 17:12.420
Oh, my God.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.819
Our old apartment.

17:14.859 --> 17:18.390
I know. I was noodling around
on Airbnb a couple of weeks ago

17:18.460 --> 17:20.430
and it was just right there listed.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.530
Unbelievable.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.460
It's $85 for the night,

17:24.530 --> 17:26.660
$6 for our old favorite
Arizona fish sticks,

17:26.730 --> 17:29.300
which you will smell
warming right now...

17:29.370 --> 17:32.340
...$3 for the "Forget Paris" rental.

17:32.410 --> 17:35.710
Aw, you even found cans of
the wine we used to like.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.540
You completely nailed it.

17:37.610 --> 17:40.040
I know. I really did! I did! I did!

17:40.110 --> 17:42.150
And it was the first time ever.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.510
And...

17:43.580 --> 17:45.050
I really want this feeling to last.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.280
Would it be weird if I asked you

17:46.350 --> 17:47.790
not to give me your gift until tomorrow?

17:47.850 --> 17:49.520
- You got it.
- Yes!

17:49.590 --> 17:50.920
In fact, I might, uh...

17:50.990 --> 17:52.920
I might sneak off and trade this in

17:52.990 --> 17:54.360
for something really terrible

17:54.430 --> 17:55.760
just to seal your victory.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.060
All right.

17:57.130 --> 17:58.960
Now let's get this party started.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.270
- No.
- Mm.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.170
- The old mixtape I made you?
- Mm-hmm.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.340
Oh, yeah. "Songs in the key of Phil."

18:06.410 --> 18:08.040
- Oh, no!
- Oh. Oh.

18:08.110 --> 18:09.870
Aw, no. Wait, hang out.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.680
- It's not going back in.
- You know what?

18:11.750 --> 18:13.410
Sometimes it's nice to not have music.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.420
Well, I'm not listening to that
all night.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.680
Oh.

18:18.750 --> 18:22.350
I wonder if the old
intercom system still works.

18:22.420 --> 18:23.960
Oh, yeah!

18:24.020 --> 18:25.960
- Yeah.
- Give it to 'em.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.390
Tell 'em how I feel.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.560
Hey!

18:31.910 --> 18:32.910
Hey! Ahh!

18:32.970 --> 18:34.170
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, oh, oh!

18:34.230 --> 18:36.530
It's okay! Okay. No need to be alarmed.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.970
- Oh, no, not the fish sticks!
- Okay...

18:41.610 --> 18:43.510
Oh, oh, Phil?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.340
Open the window,
and it'll stop the alarm!

18:47.610 --> 18:48.650
- Oh, God!
- Whoa!

18:48.720 --> 18:49.810
- Oh, God!
- Oh, it's okay!

18:49.880 --> 18:51.680
- Phil! Phil!
- Oh! I got you!

18:51.750 --> 18:53.280
- Okay...
- I got you!

18:53.350 --> 18:54.450
Oh, God.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.160
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.390
- Waah!
- Wine is flammable?!

18:59.460 --> 19:00.860
No! But that is!

19:00.930 --> 19:01.960
Oh, God.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.830
Ahh... Ohh...

19:05.530 --> 19:06.860
Raccoons!

19:06.930 --> 19:08.700
Oh, for God's sake, Phil,
just swear like an adult.

19:08.770 --> 19:09.970
No!

19:10.700 --> 19:13.070
Part of me always knew
this is how I was gonna go out.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.510
In a wine fire surrounded by raccoons?

19:15.580 --> 19:16.610
Wait.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.650
What is that?

19:25.550 --> 19:27.520
Oh, my goodness. Oh, yes.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.090
What... what is this?

19:31.420 --> 19:32.490
Ohh...

19:33.530 --> 19:35.830
Ahh! Oh, yes!

19:35.900 --> 19:38.530
Yeh-ha! Yah! Yah! Yah!

19:38.600 --> 19:40.630
- Yeah! Get out!
- You shut your mouth!

19:40.700 --> 19:42.500
Oh, yeah!

19:42.570 --> 19:44.770
And since the neighbors
can't take a hint...

19:45.340 --> 19:46.440
Oh!

19:46.510 --> 19:48.440
That was amazing.

19:48.510 --> 19:52.580
My dear, Nothing but the best for you...

19:53.750 --> 19:55.350
...on our anniversary.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.380
Now...

19:58.720 --> 20:00.050
...where were we?

20:00.120 --> 20:01.250
Okay.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.420
Oh.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.190
May I have this dance?

20:10.260 --> 20:11.730
Yes.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.660
Oh...

20:13.730 --> 20:15.930
I am the luckiest girl in the world.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.200
- Shh.
- Mm.

20:17.270 --> 20:20.900
- Did you get me a mop for our...?
- Shh.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.070
Come on.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.410
Honey, what happened?

20:28.470 --> 20:29.670
I spilled some milk.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.140
Apparently the only thing
this mop can't do is mop.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.150
Well, there's no use crying over it.

20:34.210 --> 20:35.410
Just call them and complain.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.680
Oh, you're right.

20:37.450 --> 20:40.040
<i>This is your emergency moperator,
how can I help?</i>

20:40.070 --> 20:43.840
The mop function on my mop
isn't working.

20:43.870 --> 20:47.440
<i>I'm sorry to hear that. I'm gonna
go ahead and do a remote reset,</i>

20:47.470 --> 20:49.600
<i>so you may notice your mop
gets extremely hot.</i>

20:49.620 --> 20:52.360
- Oh... Should I...
- <i>I'm kidding.</i>

20:52.400 --> 20:55.060
Good one, moperator.

20:55.090 --> 20:58.750
- You should have seen his face!
- <i>I did! You're and adorable couple.</i>

20:58.780 --> 21:00.070
Get rid of it.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.490
