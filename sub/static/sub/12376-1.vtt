02:14.617 --> 02:16.084
Thank you.

02:25.827 --> 02:28.625
You won't believe this,
you've probably heard it before...

02:28.797 --> 02:30.560
but I've never known any artists.

02:30.832 --> 02:34.131
- I am not an artist.
- Well, what's all this?

02:34.336 --> 02:37.100
I do sketches for fashion drawings.

02:37.372 --> 02:40.136
- May I see it?
- Oh, no, it's not good.

02:40.309 --> 02:44.006
If I let you see it, you might not
want to know any artists, ever.

02:44.313 --> 02:47.770
I'm afraid it would have to be pretty bad
to do that. Besides, look:

02:47.982 --> 02:50.678
"Let no one say,
and say it to your shame..."

03:15.775 --> 03:18.266
Irena Dubrovna, is that a Russian name?

03:18.445 --> 03:21.346
- No, I'm from Serbia.
- Oh, I see.

03:21.514 --> 03:23.209
Would you mind spelling it?

03:23.917 --> 03:26.112
Want to know how to spell my name?

03:26.586 --> 03:29.782
- Are you going to write me a letter?
- I'd like to write you a letter.

03:29.955 --> 03:31.980
- What about?
- I would say in this letter:

03:32.157 --> 03:35.786
"Dear Miss Dubrovna..."
I would say, "Will you have tea with me?"

03:37.029 --> 03:39.930
In that case, I'd just have
to write you another one. I'd say...

03:40.099 --> 03:41.726
Here's my house.

03:45.270 --> 03:48.831
Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like
to have tea in my apartment?

03:49.807 --> 03:52.173
Oh, Miss Dubrovna...

03:52.343 --> 03:54.538
you make life so simple.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.587
You know...

04:08.159 --> 04:12.322
I never cease to marvel at what lies
behind a brownstone front.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.436
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

04:23.740 --> 04:24.968
But you...

04:25.142 --> 04:29.636
- You looked at me in such a funny way.
- I've never had anyone here.

04:29.913 --> 04:32.403
You're the first friend I met in America.

04:32.748 --> 04:34.579
Oh, I know lots of people in business.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.880
Editors, secretaries,
other sketch artists, you know.

04:39.088 --> 04:44.287
- But you might be my first real friend.
- Thank you.

04:53.201 --> 04:55.066
- Nice.
- That's Lalage.

04:55.236 --> 04:57.932
- Lalage?
- The perfume I use. I like it.

04:58.106 --> 05:02.543
Perhaps too well. Maybe I use
too much of it, living alone like this.

05:02.711 --> 05:06.511
It's hard to describe.
Not like flowers, exactly. It's...

05:06.748 --> 05:08.841
It's like something warm and living.

05:34.707 --> 05:36.004
What's that?

05:36.175 --> 05:40.271
It's the lions in the zoo.
One can hear them here often.

05:40.446 --> 05:44.849
Many people in this building complain.
The roaring keeps them awake.

05:45.017 --> 05:47.110
- And you don't mind it?
- No.

05:47.286 --> 05:50.517
To me, it's the way the sound
of the sea is to others:

05:50.690 --> 05:54.592
Natural and soothing. I like it.

05:56.294 --> 05:59.525
Some nights there is another sound,
the panther.

05:59.698 --> 06:02.223
It screams like a woman.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.425
I don't like that.

06:04.936 --> 06:07.598
Oh, I hadn't realized how dark
it was getting.

06:09.574 --> 06:13.010
I like the dark. It's friendly.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.511
No, no, keep still, please.

06:39.269 --> 06:42.102
- Are you admiring my statue?
- Not exactly.

06:42.272 --> 06:44.297
- Who's it supposed to be?
- King John.

06:44.474 --> 06:46.908
Oh, King John, the Magna Carta
and all that stuff?

06:47.076 --> 06:49.510
No. King John of Serbia.

06:49.679 --> 06:51.544
He was a fine king.

06:51.714 --> 06:55.081
He drove the Mamluks out of Serbia
and freed the people.

06:55.318 --> 06:58.809
- Well, why have this around?
- Well, perhaps you have in your room...

06:58.987 --> 07:02.115
a picture of George Washington
or Abraham Lincoln.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.883
Well, what does it mean?

07:04.059 --> 07:08.120
- Why is he...? Why is he spearing that cat?
- Oh, it's not really a cat.

07:08.297 --> 07:13.291
It's meant to represent the evil ways
into which my village had once fallen.

07:14.369 --> 07:17.827
You see, the Mamluks
came to Serbia long ago...

07:18.006 --> 07:20.030
and they made the people slaves.

07:20.408 --> 07:22.706
Well, at first, the people were good...

07:22.877 --> 07:26.369
and worshipped God
in a true Christian way.

07:26.547 --> 07:30.415
But little by little, the people changed.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.581
When King John drove out the Mamluks...

07:34.755 --> 07:37.451
and came to our village...

07:37.625 --> 07:40.058
he found dreadful things.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.652
People bowed down to Satan...

07:43.830 --> 07:46.162
and said their Masses to him.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.994
They had become witches...

07:50.170 --> 07:52.229
and were evil.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.369
Well, King John put some of them
to the sword...

07:56.776 --> 07:58.539
but some...

07:58.712 --> 08:02.306
the wisest and the most wicked...

08:03.115 --> 08:05.549
escaped into the mountains.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.446
Now do you understand?

08:08.621 --> 08:11.385
Well, I still don't see
what it has to do with you.

08:13.525 --> 08:17.188
Those who escaped, the wicked ones...

08:17.363 --> 08:20.890
their legend haunts the village
where I was born.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.941
Boys who come to tea
can't expect to stay to dinner.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.044
Some other time perhaps.

08:39.317 --> 08:40.682
Tomorrow?

08:45.222 --> 08:47.190
Well, what time tomorrow?

08:47.357 --> 08:48.949
Dinner?

09:16.585 --> 09:18.519
A little more to the left, Harry.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.555
Easy. Just a hair.

09:22.725 --> 09:27.752
- I'm afraid she's gonna be all right, Alice.
- She's got what it takes, commodore.

09:51.552 --> 09:54.180
Isn't it a darling?

09:56.123 --> 09:57.647
- Where'd you get it?
- I bought it.

09:57.825 --> 10:01.090
- You're not going in for cats, are you?
- No, I bought it for a friend.

10:01.261 --> 10:04.458
We arrive at the inescapable conclusion
that our Oliver has a girl.

10:04.631 --> 10:05.996
A brilliant deduction, Carver.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.326
- I want to show you something.
- A girlfriend?

10:08.501 --> 10:10.492
- A girl.
- Anybody I know?

10:10.670 --> 10:12.467
Not yet, but I know you'll like her.

10:12.705 --> 10:15.173
Well, if you like her, she's okay with me.

10:26.052 --> 10:30.010
- Well, hello.
- Look, Irena. I brought you a present.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.200
Why, you little devil.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.798
Oh, it's all right.

10:51.976 --> 10:55.036
It's just that cats don't seem to like me.

10:55.212 --> 10:56.941
Yeah, but this is only a kitten.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.712
It's very friendly.
When I had it in the office...

10:59.884 --> 11:02.546
Alice, that's the girl who works
in our department...

11:02.720 --> 11:04.153
it played with her.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.288
Cats just don't like me.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.016
Oh, I know what we can do.

11:10.226 --> 11:13.161
- You got it at a pet store, didn't you?
- Yes.

11:13.329 --> 11:16.662
Good. Well, we could exchange it
for some other pet.

11:18.101 --> 11:19.864
I'll get my coat.

11:47.996 --> 11:51.624
- I'd like to exchange this kitten for a canary.
- You'll have to talk louder.

11:51.866 --> 11:56.098
- What did you say?
- I can't understand a word you say.

12:03.911 --> 12:05.879
I can't imagine what...

12:06.047 --> 12:08.811
Oh, landie, dearie me. I can't imagine
what got into them.

12:08.983 --> 12:10.280
All that caterwauling.

12:10.451 --> 12:13.146
The last time they did that was
when an alley cat got in...

12:13.320 --> 12:15.220
and ate up one of my nice Rice finches.

12:15.388 --> 12:17.549
I wanted to exchange this kitten
for a bird.

12:17.724 --> 12:19.919
Why, of course.
I have some lovely canaries.

12:20.093 --> 12:23.961
One little lemon-colored fellow
with top notes like Caruso.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.597
As peaceful as my dream of heaven.

12:29.803 --> 12:32.966
Shall we go back now
and select just which little birdie?

12:33.172 --> 12:36.403
You go, please, Oliver.
You pick the one you like.

12:36.642 --> 12:38.576
I'd rather stay here.

12:39.211 --> 12:41.941
Of course. I'll only be a minute.

12:42.781 --> 12:44.612
Animals are ever so psychic.

12:44.783 --> 12:47.149
There are some people
who just can't come in here.

12:47.319 --> 12:49.048
My dear brother's wife, for instance.

12:49.221 --> 12:52.384
She's a very nice girl.
I have nothing against her...

12:52.558 --> 12:56.459
but you just should see what happens
when she puts her foot inside this place.

12:56.628 --> 12:59.188
The cats particularly. They seem to know.

12:59.364 --> 13:03.061
You can fool everybody, but landie,
dearie me, you can't fool a cat.

13:03.234 --> 13:07.102
They seem to know who's not right,
if you know what I mean.

13:07.272 --> 13:10.639
Here we are.
Isn't he a ducky little angel?

13:13.845 --> 13:15.971
- This is it.
- Thank you.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.257
- What do you think of it?
- Oh, he is sweet.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.295
He will like me very much. You will see.

13:35.499 --> 13:39.696
- I like to be liked.
- That ought to be easy. Really easy.

13:53.149 --> 13:54.946
- Irena.
- Yes.

13:55.785 --> 13:58.617
- I've been asleep.
- I know.

13:59.254 --> 14:01.415
It couldn't have been
very entertaining for you.

14:02.057 --> 14:04.025
I was watching you.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.984
And that was fun?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.461
Do you love me, Irena?

14:14.135 --> 14:16.069
You know I love you, don't you?

14:21.742 --> 14:23.710
I've never kissed you.

14:24.878 --> 14:26.937
Do you know, that's funny.

14:28.382 --> 14:31.408
- Why?
- Well...

14:31.885 --> 14:35.480
When people in America are in love,
or even think they're in love...

14:35.656 --> 14:38.124
they've usually kissed long ago.

14:41.127 --> 14:42.617
Well?

14:46.532 --> 14:48.830
Irena, what's wrong?

14:50.470 --> 14:53.234
I've lived in dread of this moment.

14:54.974 --> 14:57.568
I've never wanted to love you.

14:59.178 --> 15:02.044
I've stayed away from people...

15:03.181 --> 15:05.206
I lived alone.

15:06.785 --> 15:10.482
- I never wanted this to happen.
- But you just told me you love me.

15:10.889 --> 15:12.481
I do.

15:13.492 --> 15:14.789
I do.

15:15.761 --> 15:18.025
I've fled from the past...

15:18.697 --> 15:21.290
from things you could never know...

15:21.632 --> 15:23.395
or understand.

15:24.602 --> 15:26.399
Evil things.

15:27.471 --> 15:28.961
Evil.

15:29.874 --> 15:31.637
Irena...

15:31.809 --> 15:33.777
you've told me something of the past.

15:33.944 --> 15:36.344
About King John and the witches
in the village...

15:36.514 --> 15:38.414
and the cat people descended from them.

15:38.582 --> 15:40.072
They're fairy tales, Irena.

15:40.251 --> 15:43.413
Fairy tales heard in your childhood.
Nothing more than that.

15:43.687 --> 15:45.746
They've nothing to do with you, really.

15:45.989 --> 15:49.083
You're Irena. You're here in America.

15:49.359 --> 15:53.193
You're so normal, you're in love with me,
Oliver Reed, a good, plain Americano.

15:53.463 --> 15:55.488
You're so normal, you're gonna marry me...

15:55.665 --> 16:00.125
and those fairy tales, you can tell them
to our children. They'll love them.

16:21.924 --> 16:23.255
Comitadji.

16:23.425 --> 16:27.758
Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call
a good man that.

16:27.929 --> 16:30.557
But it's Serbian. I got it
from my barber this afternoon.

16:30.732 --> 16:32.222
But you might insult him.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.860
- Comitadji means "thief," "bandit."
- I've been double-crossed.

16:39.674 --> 16:44.736
Oliver's bride seems to be a very nice girl.
And a very pretty one too.

16:45.579 --> 16:47.809
Carver tells me she's a bit odd.

16:47.981 --> 16:51.439
- He's worried about the marriage.
- Nonsense, Irena's a grand girl.

16:51.651 --> 16:53.983
She and Oliver are going
to be very happy together.

16:54.154 --> 16:55.416
I certainly hope so.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.752
- To the bride.
- To the bride.

17:12.104 --> 17:15.232
Look at that woman. Isn't she something?

17:19.244 --> 17:20.473
Looks like a cat.

17:23.082 --> 17:26.017
Thank you so much
for this lovely party, Alice.

17:26.419 --> 17:28.443
I didn't know
there was a Serbian restaurant.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.884
Anything you want to know
about this city, ask me.

17:31.055 --> 17:33.114
I know all the unimportant details.

18:01.051 --> 18:02.848
Well, how do you like that?

18:03.020 --> 18:05.045
What did that woman say to you, darling?

18:06.323 --> 18:08.052
Well, what did she say?

18:08.691 --> 18:11.091
Now, wait a minute.
It can't be that serious.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.625
Just one single word.

18:12.795 --> 18:14.422
She greeted me.

18:15.031 --> 18:17.295
She called me sister.

18:18.434 --> 18:20.493
You saw her, Oliver.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.434
- You saw what she looked like.
- Oh, the cat people.

18:23.606 --> 18:27.975
She looks like a cat, so she must be one
of the cat people. One of King John's pets.

18:28.144 --> 18:30.668
Irena, you crazy kid.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.180
I know a joke about weddings.

18:37.352 --> 18:40.651
Why would my wedding
be a dollar-and-cents wedding, eh?

18:40.956 --> 18:42.253
All right, why?

18:42.424 --> 18:44.654
I haven't a dollar,
and me girl hasn't any sense.

18:44.826 --> 18:49.092
- That's a corny joke even for you, doc.
- Come on, Carver.

19:07.181 --> 19:08.842
What is it, darling?

19:09.950 --> 19:13.385
I'm... I'm going to beg.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.384
Mrs. Reed.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.558
It's nice to hear that. Nice.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.964
- I want to be Mrs. Reed.
- Well, you are.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.232
But I want to be Mrs. Reed really.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.894
I want to be everything
that name means to me.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.467
And I can't. I can't.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.509
Oliver...

19:38.844 --> 19:41.278
be kind, be patient.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.242
Let me have time.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.246
Time to get over that feeling
there's something evil in me.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.277
Darling...

19:50.122 --> 19:53.250
you can have all the time
there is in the world if you want it...

19:53.424 --> 19:55.756
and all the patience
and kindness there's in me.

19:56.827 --> 19:58.727
Only a little time, Oliver.

19:59.630 --> 20:01.564
I don't want more than that.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.337
Good night, Irena.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.432
Good night, Oliver.

20:40.169 --> 20:41.466
Good night, Irena.

21:06.494 --> 21:08.985
Well, ain't seen you here
in some time, ma'am.

21:09.163 --> 21:12.064
I've been married.
I've been married for almost a month.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.025
That's what I tell this critter.

21:14.202 --> 21:17.261
Nobody comes to see him
when they're happy. No, sir.

21:17.437 --> 21:20.031
The monkey house and the aviary
gets the happy customers.

21:20.207 --> 21:21.697
But he's beautiful.

21:22.909 --> 21:24.399
No, he ain't beautiful.

21:25.278 --> 21:26.745
He's an evil critter, ma'am.

21:27.914 --> 21:30.906
You read your Bible. In Revelations...

21:31.084 --> 21:34.076
where the book's talking about
the worst beast of them all.

21:34.254 --> 21:35.619
It says:

21:35.789 --> 21:38.053
"And the beast which I saw...

21:38.224 --> 21:40.055
was like unto a leopard."

21:40.292 --> 21:43.022
- Like unto a leopard.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.459
Like a leopard, but not a leopard.

21:46.632 --> 21:48.600
I guess that fits this fella.

21:48.768 --> 21:50.895
Yes, it fits him.

21:58.978 --> 22:01.445
Best wishes for your marriage, ma'am.

24:27.885 --> 24:29.819
Would you like some sherry?

24:38.796 --> 24:41.959
If you're determined to mourn that bird,
we'll have a regular wake.

24:42.133 --> 24:45.193
It's not just because the bird died.

24:45.369 --> 24:46.801
It's me.

24:46.970 --> 24:50.599
I envy every woman I see on the street.

24:50.774 --> 24:54.335
- They can't match your little finger.
- I envy them.

24:54.978 --> 24:58.470
They are happy.
They make their husbands happy.

24:58.648 --> 25:01.549
They lead normal, happy lives.

25:02.686 --> 25:04.551
They're free.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.555
- Do you know what happened to the bird?
- It died.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.824
It died of fright when I tried
to take it in my hand.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.468
All right, the bird was afraid of you.
That's nothing.

25:20.636 --> 25:22.536
I had a rabbit once that hated me...

25:22.705 --> 25:25.333
yet I grew up to be quite a nice fella.

25:27.910 --> 25:29.137
Oliver.

25:30.879 --> 25:33.712
When I went past the panther's cage...

25:34.382 --> 25:36.373
I had to open the box.

25:37.018 --> 25:39.384
I had to throw the bird to him.

25:40.054 --> 25:44.548
Do you understand?
I had to. I had to do it.

25:48.696 --> 25:50.822
That's what frightens me.

26:00.607 --> 26:04.634
Irena, I've been trying
to kid you out of it.

26:04.811 --> 26:06.073
Maybe that's wrong.

26:06.246 --> 26:09.977
- I've tried to...
- No one could have been more gentle...

26:10.150 --> 26:11.377
or more patient.

26:11.550 --> 26:14.849
I've tried to make you realize
all these stories are so much nonsense.

26:15.288 --> 26:19.418
But now I see it's not the stories.
It's the fact that you believe them.

26:20.226 --> 26:22.091
We've got to have help, Irena.

26:26.766 --> 26:27.994
Not that sort of help.

26:28.267 --> 26:31.793
There's something wrong, and we have
to face it in an intelligent way.

26:31.970 --> 26:35.098
We don't need a King John
with fire and sword.

26:35.273 --> 26:39.266
We need someone who can find
the reason for your belief and cure it.

26:41.212 --> 26:43.077
That's what we need.

26:44.449 --> 26:45.507
A psychiatrist.

26:46.117 --> 26:48.108
Oh, find one for me, Oliver.

26:48.820 --> 26:52.483
The best one. The very best one.

26:54.158 --> 26:56.251
You were saying, the cats...

26:57.328 --> 26:59.023
They torment me.

26:59.964 --> 27:01.397
I wake in the night...

27:01.932 --> 27:05.925
and the tread of their feet
whispers in my brain.

27:07.404 --> 27:09.463
I have no peace...

27:11.008 --> 27:12.999
for they are in me.

27:15.845 --> 27:17.244
In me.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.311
In me.

27:47.442 --> 27:49.034
Hypnosis always tires me.

27:49.211 --> 27:51.839
Some of my patients, too,
find it exhausting.

27:52.180 --> 27:55.377
It's only that I remember nothing.

27:55.549 --> 27:58.916
It's my duty to remember.
I have it all here.

27:59.186 --> 28:00.414
Most interesting.

28:00.788 --> 28:05.054
You told me of your village
and the people and their strange beliefs.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.753
I am so ashamed. It must seem so childish.

28:08.929 --> 28:12.092
And the cat women of your village too.
You told me of them.

28:12.299 --> 28:15.894
Women who, in jealousy or anger
or out of their own corrupt passions...

28:16.070 --> 28:19.163
can change into great cats, like panthers.

28:20.106 --> 28:22.404
And if one of these women
were to fall in love...

28:22.609 --> 28:25.635
and if her lover were to kiss her,
take her into his embrace...

28:25.812 --> 28:28.747
she would be driven by her own evil
to kill him.

28:29.783 --> 28:32.946
That's what you believe and fear,
isn't it?

28:34.554 --> 28:37.454
These things are very simple
to psychiatrists.

28:39.391 --> 28:41.325
You told me about your childhood.

28:41.493 --> 28:45.224
Perhaps we will find this trouble stems
from some early experience.

28:45.497 --> 28:47.624
You said you didn't know your father.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.827
That he died in some mysterious
accident in the forest before your birth.

28:52.004 --> 28:55.235
And because of that, the children
teased you and called your mother...

28:55.407 --> 28:57.500
a witch, a cat woman.

28:59.310 --> 29:03.644
These childhood tragedies
are inclined to corrode the soul...

29:03.815 --> 29:06.010
to leave a canker in the mind.

29:06.184 --> 29:08.550
But we will try to repair the damage.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.545
You're not to worry.

29:11.722 --> 29:14.054
And what shall I tell my husband?

29:14.225 --> 29:16.785
Naturally, he is anxious
to have some word.

29:16.961 --> 29:20.418
What does one tell a husband?
One tells him nothing.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.342
Alice, it's so nice to see you.

29:36.746 --> 29:37.974
Hello, darling.

29:38.148 --> 29:40.581
- How did you make out with Louis?
- Louis?

29:40.816 --> 29:42.511
Dr. Judd.

29:43.419 --> 29:44.647
Alice knows, darling.

29:46.222 --> 29:50.124
Of course. Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd?
I met him on the commodore's boat.

29:50.292 --> 29:53.318
The way he goes around kissing hands
makes me want to spit cotton.

29:53.696 --> 29:56.631
But I guess he knows all
there is to know about psychiatry.

30:01.036 --> 30:03.560
I told Alice. I knew she'd know
some good doctor.

30:05.073 --> 30:07.507
I don't see why that was necessary.

30:09.511 --> 30:12.480
Sorry. I seem to have put
my big foot in it.

30:17.986 --> 30:19.681
I'm sorry, Irena.

30:19.888 --> 30:23.220
I'm sure neither Oliver nor I
had any notion of offending you.

30:23.524 --> 30:25.549
I'm dreadfully sorry.

30:27.828 --> 30:29.159
Goodbye, Alice.

30:38.305 --> 30:41.001
- Darling, really, there's no reason to...
- But, Oliver...

30:41.175 --> 30:43.075
how can you discuss such things?

30:43.242 --> 30:47.474
Such intimate things about me?
How much did you tell her?

30:47.647 --> 30:50.980
You can tell Alice anything. She's
a good egg, she understands anything.

30:51.150 --> 30:55.280
There are some things a woman doesn't
want other women to understand.

31:59.949 --> 32:01.211
Irena.

32:04.687 --> 32:07.553
I woke up. You were gone.

32:07.723 --> 32:11.318
- What's wrong, darling?
- I couldn't sleep. I went out.

32:11.526 --> 32:14.393
- Where'd you go?
- Just walked.

32:14.596 --> 32:16.621
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.492
I just didn't think.

32:20.669 --> 32:22.330
Oliver...

32:22.504 --> 32:24.529
we should never quarrel.

32:24.706 --> 32:27.573
Never let me feel jealousy or anger.

32:27.743 --> 32:31.735
Whatever is in me is held in,
is kept harmless...

32:31.912 --> 32:33.345
when I am happy.

32:33.514 --> 32:35.675
I'd turn handsprings, darling.

32:35.850 --> 32:38.512
I'd dance in the streets
to make you happy.

32:46.193 --> 32:47.785
Toward the sheer line.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.995
Sixty-two degrees.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.865
Hey.

32:57.003 --> 33:00.939
I'm sorry. I must have given you
the wrong figure. Let me try again.

33:01.107 --> 33:02.734
Wait, let's have a cigarette first.

33:02.909 --> 33:06.037
That's the third wrong figure
you've given me this morning.

33:06.212 --> 33:08.237
Getting careless in my old age.

33:08.415 --> 33:11.747
Something's on your mind. Anything wrong?

33:12.785 --> 33:14.150
Nope.

33:17.589 --> 33:19.386
Must be marriage.

33:20.993 --> 33:22.961
Well, in a way, it is.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.054
I'm worried about Irena.

33:25.230 --> 33:27.721
But I thought she was going to Dr. Judd.

33:27.900 --> 33:31.232
Yeah, that's what I thought.
But I ran into Dr. Judd this morning.

33:31.402 --> 33:33.461
She hasn't been back
since the first visit.

33:33.638 --> 33:37.005
But you told me she seemed
so anxious to be cured.

33:37.942 --> 33:41.241
- Apparently not.
- I'm sorry, Ollie.

33:41.412 --> 33:43.744
Must make you very unhappy.

33:45.016 --> 33:47.109
You know, it's a funny thing.

33:47.852 --> 33:50.685
I've never been unhappy before.

33:51.055 --> 33:55.354
Things have always gone swell for me.
I had a grand time as a kid.

33:55.525 --> 33:57.618
Lots of fun at school...

33:57.794 --> 34:01.560
and here at the office with you
and the commodore and doc.

34:02.933 --> 34:05.993
That's why I don't know
what to do about all this.

34:06.803 --> 34:08.293
I've just never been unhappy.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.341
Hey.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.309
Now, wait a minute.

34:24.320 --> 34:28.051
I can't help it. I just can't help it.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.224
I can't bear to see you unhappy.

34:31.393 --> 34:35.123
I love you too darn much,
and I don't care if you do know it, Ollie.

34:35.295 --> 34:37.025
I love you.

34:38.666 --> 34:41.692
I'm sorry. Forget it.

34:41.870 --> 34:45.533
- There's Irena, you're in love with her.
- I don't know.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.972
All this trouble has made me think...

34:51.079 --> 34:53.639
I don't know what love really is.

34:54.248 --> 34:55.737
I don't know...

34:55.916 --> 34:59.716
- even whether I'm in love with Irena.
- I know what love is.

35:00.053 --> 35:01.953
It's understanding.

35:02.356 --> 35:05.757
It's you and me,
and let the rest of the world go by.

35:06.126 --> 35:10.529
It's just the two of us living our lives
together, happily and proudly.

35:10.831 --> 35:13.197
No self-torture and no doubt.

35:13.834 --> 35:16.063
It's enduring and it's everlasting.

35:16.335 --> 35:18.235
Nothing can change it.

35:18.738 --> 35:20.865
Nothing can change us, Ollie.

35:21.374 --> 35:23.001
That's what I think love is.

35:23.776 --> 35:25.141
Well...

35:25.745 --> 35:28.043
that isn't the way I feel about Irena.

35:29.048 --> 35:30.811
It's a different feeling.

35:32.418 --> 35:34.477
I'm drawn to her.

35:35.121 --> 35:37.611
There's a warmth from her...

35:38.290 --> 35:40.349
that pulls at me.

35:40.592 --> 35:43.425
I have to watch her
when she's in the room.

35:43.595 --> 35:46.223
I have to touch her when she's near.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.560
But I don't really know her.

35:50.735 --> 35:53.226
In many ways, we're strangers.

35:54.039 --> 35:55.973
You and I...

35:56.675 --> 35:59.165
we'll never be strangers.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.602
You forgot your key.

36:31.774 --> 36:34.641
Oh, I'm always forgetting it.
But ain't no worry in it.

36:34.811 --> 36:37.575
Nobody would want to steal
one of them critters.

36:45.254 --> 36:47.779
You resist temptation admirably.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.789
- Temptation?
- The key.

36:50.993 --> 36:53.791
- Why would I want it?
- For many reasons.

36:53.962 --> 36:58.661
There is, in some cases, a psychic
need to loose evil upon the world.

36:58.834 --> 37:01.961
And we all of us carry within us
a desire for death.

37:02.136 --> 37:06.129
You fear the panther, yet you're drawn
to him again and again.

37:06.707 --> 37:09.904
Couldn't you turn to him
as an instrument of death?

37:11.212 --> 37:14.704
You didn't come back to see me Friday,
I've had to come to you.

37:14.882 --> 37:19.285
- Well, how did you know where to find me?
- You told me many things.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.314
Why didn't you come back?

37:22.489 --> 37:24.548
I don't feel you can help me.

37:24.724 --> 37:27.158
You're very wise, you know a great deal...

37:27.327 --> 37:31.093
yet when you speak of the soul,
you mean the mind.

37:31.264 --> 37:35.257
- And it is not my mind that is troubled.
- What a clever girl.

37:35.435 --> 37:38.029
All the psychologists
have tried for years to find...

37:38.204 --> 37:40.399
that subtle difference
between mind and soul.

37:40.574 --> 37:41.836
And you found it.

37:42.008 --> 37:44.407
It does seem presumptuous of me,
doesn't it?

37:45.010 --> 37:46.534
Goodbye, doctor.

38:04.596 --> 38:05.961
Irena.

38:15.039 --> 38:17.564
I'm worried. What's happening to us?

38:17.742 --> 38:19.471
I love you, Oliver.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.737
I know, but people can love...

38:21.913 --> 38:24.279
and people can still drift apart.

38:24.448 --> 38:27.212
And that's what I feel is happening to us.

38:28.285 --> 38:29.718
We don't talk together openly.

38:29.886 --> 38:33.151
- You're not frank with me.
- I've never lied to you.

38:34.992 --> 38:37.654
I ran into Dr. Judd today.

38:39.796 --> 38:42.731
- You haven't been back to see him.
- He cannot help me.

38:42.899 --> 38:46.629
Well, you won't let him help you.
You won't let me help you.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.201
You won't even help yourself.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.402
It's what I said to Alice this afternoon.

38:50.573 --> 38:52.564
- You're content to go on as we are...
- Alice.

38:57.313 --> 39:00.407
Oh, I... I promised you
we'd never quarrel.

39:02.084 --> 39:03.415
Let's calm down a bit.

39:05.521 --> 39:07.647
I'll go back to the office.

39:08.423 --> 39:10.391
I've got some work to do.

39:34.181 --> 39:36.513
Oh, do you wanna go up
to the office, Mr. Reed?

39:36.684 --> 39:40.814
I think I'll go around to Sally Lunn's, get
a cup of coffee before I get to work.

39:40.988 --> 39:42.751
I'll be back.

39:57.804 --> 40:00.238
- Hello, Mr. Reed.
- Minnie.

40:00.406 --> 40:02.636
Maybe you'd like some nice
chicken gumbo today?

40:02.809 --> 40:04.401
No, thanks, Minnie.

40:04.577 --> 40:07.137
How about some apple pie
and a cup of coffee?

40:07.313 --> 40:08.644
Yes, sir.

40:08.915 --> 40:12.179
My goodness, don't nobody
like chicken gumbo?

40:31.469 --> 40:32.868
Hello?

40:34.505 --> 40:35.494
Hello?

40:36.640 --> 40:38.335
Hello?

40:38.509 --> 40:39.737
Hello?

40:46.217 --> 40:49.345
John Paul Jones, don't you hate
people who do that?

40:57.093 --> 40:58.492
Good night, John Paul.

41:14.176 --> 41:16.872
Here, Mrs. Agnew, new
matchbooks for your collection.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.706
Oh, thank you, Miss Moore.

41:18.881 --> 41:21.372
Chartreuse. Ain't that elegant?

41:22.217 --> 41:24.151
Too bad you wasn't here just a minute ago.

41:24.319 --> 41:26.480
- Mr. Reed looked in.
- Oh, where did he go?

41:26.655 --> 41:28.646
Said he was going around to Sally Lunn's.

41:28.824 --> 41:32.487
- I'll see if I can catch him. Good night.
- Good night, Miss Moore.

41:40.001 --> 41:42.834
- Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me?
- Hello.

41:43.004 --> 41:47.498
I sure could, only this coffee's
been working so long it's got muscles.

41:47.942 --> 41:51.378
What are you doing in this part of town
at this hour of night?

41:53.614 --> 41:55.274
Stormy weather.

42:07.928 --> 42:10.522
You're going to have to solve
your problems your own way.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.927
I'm going to drink up and go home.

42:15.267 --> 42:18.395
I think you'd better go home too
and make it up with Irena.

42:18.571 --> 42:20.801
Alice, you're very swell.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.942
That's what makes me dangerous.
I'm the new type of other woman.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.599
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

42:25.778 --> 42:27.643
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

42:37.422 --> 42:40.914
- You cold?
- A cat just walked over my grave.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.664
Don't you want me to walk you home?

42:50.835 --> 42:53.531
No, thanks. I'm a big girl now
and I'm not afraid.

42:53.705 --> 42:56.731
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

44:31.264 --> 44:34.961
Climb on, sister. Are you riding with me,
or ain't you?

44:37.437 --> 44:41.373
- You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- Did you see it?

45:38.928 --> 45:40.361
Taxi, lady?

46:06.187 --> 46:08.917
No, please, don't. Don't touch me.

46:11.726 --> 46:13.057
Irena.

46:13.728 --> 46:15.491
I'm sorry.

46:15.663 --> 46:19.690
I've been worried to death.
I didn't know where you were. I thought...

46:22.470 --> 46:25.337
What happened tonight
happens in every family.

46:25.506 --> 46:27.564
I was all on edge.

46:27.908 --> 46:31.002
You've got to understand
and you've got to forgive me.

46:34.548 --> 46:36.516
I forgive you.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.235
- Irena.
- What?

47:04.276 --> 47:08.372
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

47:38.809 --> 47:41.175
To loose evil upon the world.

47:41.345 --> 47:46.476
There is, in some cases, a psychic
need to loose evil upon the world.

47:46.984 --> 47:51.818
There is, in some cases,
a psychic need, a desire for death.

47:52.455 --> 47:55.754
To loose evil. A desire for death.

47:55.925 --> 47:58.792
A psychic need. The key.

47:59.162 --> 48:00.959
The key.

48:01.230 --> 48:03.164
The key.

48:03.332 --> 48:05.197
The key.

48:46.307 --> 48:48.366
I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.

48:48.542 --> 48:50.942
Darling, there are some
beautiful moderns upstairs.

48:51.111 --> 48:54.409
- Why don't you take a look at them.
- But I like these little boats.

48:54.581 --> 48:56.173
I want to be with you.

48:56.349 --> 48:58.579
- Don't send me away.
- We're not sending you away.

48:58.751 --> 49:00.742
We just don't want you to be bored.

49:02.722 --> 49:05.384
We'll meet you in the main lobby
in an hour.

49:07.427 --> 49:10.453
Ollie, look, a drawing of the Victory.

49:10.697 --> 49:14.223
You know, that's the last man-of-war
with a lateen sail aft.

49:59.109 --> 50:02.010
- Could I have the key to the swimming pool?
- Of course, dearie.

50:02.178 --> 50:03.702
What a darling kitten.

50:03.880 --> 50:07.247
Yeah. It's one of four.
A tabby had them about a month ago.

50:09.619 --> 50:13.316
- Turn the lights out when you're through.
- I won't forget.

50:13.923 --> 50:15.220
Hello?

50:20.562 --> 50:21.824
Yeah.

50:23.065 --> 50:25.795
- Just a moment, dearie. Yes?
- Is Miss Moore in?

50:25.968 --> 50:28.061
She just went downstairs
to the swimming pool.

50:28.237 --> 50:30.137
Would it be all right
if I went to see her?

50:30.306 --> 50:33.070
Of course, dearie.
Right down them steps there.

50:33.676 --> 50:35.735
Oh, gee, I can't tonight.

52:14.171 --> 52:15.661
Help!

52:18.909 --> 52:20.900
Help!

52:24.180 --> 52:26.011
Gee whiz, Mrs. Hanson.

52:26.949 --> 52:29.247
Help!

52:39.896 --> 52:41.796
What is the matter, Alice?

52:46.935 --> 52:49.529
- Gee whiz, dearie, are you all right?
- It's nothing.

52:49.704 --> 52:53.231
It was dark down here, and Mrs. Reed
coming in unexpectedly frightened me.

52:53.408 --> 52:54.773
I'm terribly sorry.

52:57.179 --> 52:59.647
No, don't go. I'm coming right out.

53:05.085 --> 53:07.053
Sorry to have disturbed you, Alice.

53:07.221 --> 53:10.452
I missed you and Oliver,
and I thought you might know where he is.

53:10.624 --> 53:14.958
We waited for you at the museum.
You'll probably find him at home.

53:15.129 --> 53:17.859
If you don't mind then, I'll run on.

53:32.679 --> 53:35.614
- Could I have my robe, please?
- Sure.

53:37.717 --> 53:40.709
Gee whiz, honey, it's torn to ribbons.

53:54.366 --> 53:56.698
Thank you for coming
at so late an hour, Dr. Judd.

53:56.902 --> 54:00.167
I phoned you because I'm troubled.
I think you can help me.

54:00.639 --> 54:02.937
How much do you believe
about the cat people?

54:03.108 --> 54:04.336
The cat people?

54:04.510 --> 54:07.479
- The story Mrs. Reed told me?
- Yes.

54:07.645 --> 54:11.706
I believe, my dear Miss Moore,
exactly as I told Mrs. Reed:

54:11.883 --> 54:16.877
The story is a product of her own fear,
her own overworked imagination.

54:17.054 --> 54:19.784
What would you say, Dr. Judd,
if I were to tell you...

54:19.957 --> 54:22.425
- that I believe Irena's story?
- Yes?

54:22.793 --> 54:25.591
Twice I've been followed
by something that was not human...

54:25.763 --> 54:28.527
something that attempted to take my life.

54:28.965 --> 54:32.196
I believe that was the cat form of Irena.

54:32.369 --> 54:34.860
But why should she wish to harm you?

54:35.272 --> 54:37.206
Because I'm in love with her husband.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.599
My dear Miss Moore...

54:39.776 --> 54:42.472
this story grows more and more charming.

54:42.646 --> 54:45.206
Simpler too, all the time.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.751
You're both victims of fear.

54:48.919 --> 54:52.581
Mrs. Reed fears the past,
and you fear the present.

54:52.755 --> 54:55.553
Mrs. Reed has a very strong imagination...

54:55.724 --> 54:57.749
and you have an equally strong conscience.

54:57.927 --> 55:00.589
Dr. Judd, the danger that threatened me
was very real.

55:00.763 --> 55:03.288
You disappoint me, Miss Moore.

55:05.134 --> 55:07.261
Here is my robe.

55:11.539 --> 55:13.871
To understand this,
I should first have to hear...

55:14.042 --> 55:16.704
Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself.

55:17.512 --> 55:19.742
That should be a most
interesting interview.

55:19.914 --> 55:22.348
I shouldn't advise you to see her alone.

55:22.517 --> 55:25.577
Do you think I'm afraid
of so charming a lady?

55:25.753 --> 55:28.881
Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me,
but you must be careful.

55:29.057 --> 55:31.547
Oh, you want me to carry
some means of protection.

55:31.758 --> 55:35.194
A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet.
Is that what you mean?

55:35.362 --> 55:37.887
If you are lucky enough to have one.

55:39.032 --> 55:40.897
Of course...

55:42.202 --> 55:44.261
this isn't silver.

55:46.239 --> 55:47.934
Good night, Miss Moore.

55:54.413 --> 55:57.610
You say you have lapses of memory
for which you cannot account.

55:57.783 --> 56:00.115
They are becoming more frequent,
and you're afraid.

56:00.286 --> 56:02.220
Help me.

56:02.388 --> 56:04.948
I can't help you.
You're not truthful with me.

56:05.124 --> 56:08.924
But I am. I've told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

56:09.095 --> 56:12.258
Do you sincerely believe that
if your husband were to kiss you...

56:12.431 --> 56:15.627
you would change into a cat
and rend him to bits?

56:15.800 --> 56:18.701
I don't know. I am only afraid.

56:20.672 --> 56:22.936
And if I were to kiss you?

56:24.075 --> 56:27.704
I only know that I should not like
to be kissed by you.

56:31.549 --> 56:34.074
My dear Mrs. Reed,
sometimes in my profession...

56:34.252 --> 56:37.516
there comes a contest of wills
between the doctor and his patient.

56:38.288 --> 56:41.485
Patients are clever. Very clever.

56:41.659 --> 56:44.685
And they can fool the doctor sometimes.

56:47.998 --> 56:49.431
You are very clever.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.831
And perhaps you enjoy this little game
you are having with me.

56:53.003 --> 56:55.527
But I shall discover your secret.

56:55.705 --> 56:58.970
Dr. Judd, believe me.
I beg you to believe me.

56:59.142 --> 57:03.772
I have no secret. I told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

57:03.946 --> 57:06.039
I need your help.

57:06.683 --> 57:08.583
I can't help you.

57:09.819 --> 57:11.844
But I can warn you.

57:12.021 --> 57:14.581
These hallucinations approach insanity.

57:14.757 --> 57:18.715
This nonsense about Miss Moore
at the park and in the swimming pool...

57:18.894 --> 57:22.591
it's a deterioration of the mind,
escape into fantasy.

57:22.764 --> 57:24.755
And it's dangerous.

57:25.734 --> 57:27.395
At this moment...

57:27.569 --> 57:31.562
I could go before a board
and have you put away for observation.

57:31.740 --> 57:34.607
You are that close to real insanity.

57:39.447 --> 57:41.142
I can't help you.

57:41.315 --> 57:43.146
You can only help yourself.

57:43.317 --> 57:46.582
You keep going back
to the mad legends of your birthplace.

57:46.754 --> 57:48.517
Forget them.

57:48.689 --> 57:51.715
You surround yourself
with cat objects, pictures.

57:51.892 --> 57:55.293
Get rid of them. Lead a normal life.

57:56.297 --> 57:58.924
You know, for the first time
you've really helped me.

57:59.099 --> 58:01.795
Maybe it's because you interest me.

58:25.691 --> 58:27.249
Oliver.

58:27.426 --> 58:29.951
I went back to Dr. Judd's office.

58:30.262 --> 58:32.560
I'm no longer afraid.

58:33.665 --> 58:36.634
Believe me, Irena, I'd have been
the happiest man in the world...

58:36.802 --> 58:38.702
if you told me that a little while ago.

58:39.238 --> 58:41.330
But things have changed.

58:42.673 --> 58:46.473
I had to learn, maybe through
this marriage of ours.

58:46.744 --> 58:49.008
I didn't want to tell you this...

58:49.313 --> 58:51.975
but now, you see, I have to.

58:52.750 --> 58:54.547
I love Alice.

58:54.952 --> 58:56.943
Irena, it's too late.

58:57.121 --> 58:58.748
Too late.

59:00.324 --> 59:03.383
Well, there seems only one decent thing
for me to do.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.990
I'll give you a divorce.

59:06.797 --> 59:09.561
- Believe me, it's better this way.
- Better?

59:10.167 --> 59:13.603
- Better for whom?
- Irena, I...

59:13.770 --> 59:15.499
Speak.

59:15.772 --> 59:17.763
You can't speak.

59:17.941 --> 59:20.102
There's nothing you can say.

59:21.511 --> 59:23.774
There's only silence.

59:28.651 --> 59:30.812
But I love silence.

59:30.986 --> 59:32.920
I love loneliness.

59:33.689 --> 59:35.657
And they... They are in me.

59:35.825 --> 59:38.453
Their strength, warmth.

59:38.627 --> 59:41.755
They're soft. They're soft.

59:41.931 --> 59:45.525
- Irena, you're talking like an insane woman.
- Please go.

59:46.868 --> 59:49.200
I want you to go, please.

59:49.671 --> 59:51.298
Go.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.102
Go.

01:00:18.465 --> 01:00:20.490
Bavarian cream?

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.566
Roquefort?

01:00:27.506 --> 01:00:29.940
And you get the apple pie.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:33.938
I have pointed out
two alternatives, Mr. Reed:

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:36.707
Either have her put away
for observation and restraint...

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.748
or have your marriage annulled.

01:00:38.918 --> 01:00:41.079
It's tough for Oliver either way, doctor.

01:00:41.621 --> 01:00:44.988
As a psychiatrist, I should recommend
that you have her put away.

01:00:45.157 --> 01:00:48.421
As your friend, however, I have
much more reasonable advice to offer.

01:00:48.593 --> 01:00:50.754
I think you should have
your marriage annulled.

01:00:50.929 --> 01:00:53.489
In that way, you are free
of responsibility.

01:00:53.665 --> 01:00:56.793
- You two could marry.
- And if Irena's sent away?

01:00:56.968 --> 01:01:00.301
The law is quite explicit.
One cannot divorce an insane person.

01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:03.039
If she's not well,
I've got to take care of her.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.766
It's the only right thing, Ollie.

01:01:04.943 --> 01:01:07.536
As you will. I'll have
the commitment papers drawn up...

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:10.839
and arrange an interview
with Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.

01:01:11.015 --> 01:01:12.778
Shall we say 6:00?

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.668
Let's not play that.

01:01:33.603 --> 01:01:36.868
I don't think Irena's coming.
We've waited an hour and a half.

01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:40.205
Perhaps it's useless to wait.

01:01:41.311 --> 01:01:43.609
I don't think she intends coming.

01:01:44.147 --> 01:01:46.445
She's probably walking in the park.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.689
Ollie, let's get back to the office.
We've had a broken-up day...

01:01:54.856 --> 01:01:57.848
- and there's lots of work to be done.
- Suits me.

01:02:20.481 --> 01:02:23.177
How stupid of me, I left
my walking stick in the apartment.

01:02:23.351 --> 01:02:25.216
- I'll get it for you.
- No, it's my fault.

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:27.616
Give me the key. I shall only be a moment.

01:02:54.113 --> 01:02:56.081
Five and a half.

01:02:56.915 --> 01:02:58.405
Five and a half.

01:02:58.584 --> 01:03:00.279
And...

01:03:01.186 --> 01:03:04.883
one and three-eighths.

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:07.918
And one and three-eighths.

01:03:08.093 --> 01:03:09.720
There.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:11.993
I'll get it.

01:03:17.802 --> 01:03:19.099
Hello?

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.703
Hello?

01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:24.373
Hello?

01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:29.236
They hung up on me.

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:33.109
- That's funny.
- What?

01:03:33.284 --> 01:03:35.683
It happened once before like that.

01:03:35.919 --> 01:03:38.547
The telephone rang, and I answered.

01:03:38.955 --> 01:03:41.287
There was someone
on the other end of the line.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:43.323
I could almost hear them listening.

01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:46.758
And then there was a little click
as they hung up the receiver.

01:03:47.364 --> 01:03:50.629
That was the night
I was followed on the transverse.

01:03:50.867 --> 01:03:52.630
Ollie...

01:03:52.803 --> 01:03:55.327
let's get out of here. I'm afraid.

01:03:55.938 --> 01:03:58.065
That was Irena.
I know it was Irena who called.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.232
She could call from downstairs.
She may be on her way up now.

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.139
Get your things.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.410
The door's open. We can see
to get out into the hall.

01:04:15.623 --> 01:04:18.023
I'll turn out the table lights.

01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:24.087
It's shut now.
Just a minute ago, it was open.

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:32.999
It's locked.

01:04:59.298 --> 01:05:00.663
Irena.

01:05:02.135 --> 01:05:03.659
Irena.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.071
Leave us, Irena!

01:05:19.217 --> 01:05:22.345
In the name of God, leave us in peace.

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:40.598
Come on.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.256
Let's go down the stairs.

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.802
Don't, Alice. It's gone.
Everything's all right. Don't be afraid.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.870
I'm not afraid.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.370
Look.

01:06:21.476 --> 01:06:25.173
Irena's perfume. Strong. Sweet.

01:06:35.924 --> 01:06:38.085
I need a drink.

01:06:59.947 --> 01:07:01.471
- Yes?
- Dr. Judd.

01:07:01.649 --> 01:07:02.843
Miss Moore?

01:07:03.017 --> 01:07:06.975
Yes. We've been trying to get you
on the phone, Dr. Judd. I called your hotel.

01:07:07.153 --> 01:07:11.055
Yes, I know, that's what
I want to talk about. Are you alone?

01:07:11.224 --> 01:07:14.455
You'd better leave then.
She may be on her way back now.

01:07:14.828 --> 01:07:17.524
But she is dangerous, Dr. Judd.
I warn you.

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:23.027
Hello? Hello, Dr. Judd?

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:27.934
Dr. Judd?

01:07:28.674 --> 01:07:30.938
I think Irena just came in.
He hung up on me.

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:32.702
Come on.

01:07:33.078 --> 01:07:34.978
We'll get a taxi.

01:07:36.782 --> 01:07:38.977
You're late, aren't you?

01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:41.381
I kept my appointment.

01:07:42.254 --> 01:07:44.916
You see, I've never believed your story.

01:07:46.324 --> 01:07:48.485
I am not afraid of you.

01:07:50.094 --> 01:07:52.255
I take you in my arms.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.997
So little, so soft.

01:07:56.601 --> 01:07:58.967
This warm perfume in your hair.

01:07:59.137 --> 01:08:00.798
Your body.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.365
Don't be afraid of me, Irena.

01:09:31.124 --> 01:09:32.819
He's dead.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.688
Mr. Reed. Oh, Mr. Reed.

01:09:44.136 --> 01:09:45.661
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Reed.

01:09:45.837 --> 01:09:49.171
Sue Ellen and I phoned the police
just as soon as we heard the racket.

01:09:53.412 --> 01:09:55.141
Thank you.

01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:08.052
Sue Ellen, you know better than that.

01:10:08.226 --> 01:10:11.923
You're not supposed to touch anything
until the police get here.

01:10:12.129 --> 01:10:14.393
- The sword cane.
- Broken. Half of it's gone.

01:10:14.565 --> 01:10:17.056
We've got to find her. Come on.

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:09.503
She never lied to us.
