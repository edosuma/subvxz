00:37.954 --> 00:40.206
<i>Five thousand years ago...</i>

00:40.289 --> 00:43.125
<i>a fierce warrior known</i>
<i>as the Scorpion King...</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:45.211
<i>led a great army on a campaign...</i>

00:45.294 --> 00:47.797
<i>to conquer the known world.</i>

02:08.711 --> 02:13.382
<i>After a vicious campaign</i>
<i>which lasted seven long years...</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:16.135
<i>the Scorpion King and his army</i>
<i>were defeated...</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:19.931
<i>and driven deep into</i>
<i>the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.</i>

02:42.745 --> 02:47.166
<i>One by one, they slowly perished</i>
<i>under the scorching sun...</i>

02:49.418 --> 02:52.922
<i>until only the great warrior himself</i>
<i>was left alive.</i>

03:00.346 --> 03:02.014
<i>Near death...</i>

03:02.098 --> 03:06.227
<i>the Scorpion King made a pact</i>
<i>with the dark god Anubis...</i>

03:06.352 --> 03:09.021
<i>that if Anubis</i>
<i>would spare his life...</i>

03:09.105 --> 03:11.691
<i>and let him conquer his enemies...</i>

03:11.774 --> 03:14.443
<i>he would give him his soul.</i>

03:21.951 --> 03:25.621
<i>Anubis accepted his offer</i>
<i>and spared his life.</i>

03:53.316 --> 03:56.194
<i>Anubis gave the Scorpion King</i>
<i>command of his army...</i>

03:58.487 --> 04:01.073
<i>and like an evil flood,</i>
<i>they washed away...</i>

04:01.157 --> 04:03.451
<i>all that lay before them.</i>

04:14.170 --> 04:16.047
<i>When his task was done...</i>

04:16.172 --> 04:20.051
<i>Anubis forced the Scorpion King</i>
<i>to serve him for all time.</i>

04:27.183 --> 04:31.062
<i>His army was returned</i>
<i>to the sands from whence they came...</i>

04:36.108 --> 04:39.028
<i>where they wait, silently...</i>

04:39.111 --> 04:41.280
<i>to be awakened once again.</i>

06:17.960 --> 06:20.171
Alex?

06:20.296 --> 06:23.090
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.885
I'll tell you a story some time.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.012
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us in the temple.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.889
It's dangerous down here.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.683
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?

06:32.808 --> 06:35.269
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche just like it.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.688
With the pyramid and the eye...

06:37.813 --> 06:40.608
and the two kings and everything.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.610
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.780
Okay. Well, I'll be up to take
a look at that in a minute.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.366
In the meantime, I want you
to wait for us up there.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.368
Pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up in the temple.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.331
Go on.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.375
And what should I do?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.877
I don't know. Surprise me.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.463
- Build a better mousetrap.
- Okay.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.674
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.690
Go away.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.320
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.406
What was all that about?

07:28.531 --> 07:31.200
Nothing.
Alex wanted to show me something.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.995
I swear...

07:34.120 --> 07:36.497
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.833
You mean
more attractive, sweet...

07:38.958 --> 07:41.085
and devilishly charming?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.671
No, he's driving me crazy.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.548
Now, where were we?

07:46.632 --> 07:48.551
Hammer and chisel.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.433
All right, all right!
Let's do it your way.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.934
Thank you.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.830
Ever since I had that dream...

08:17.914 --> 08:21.209
this place is all
I can think about.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.504
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night of sleep.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.591
I feel like I've been here before.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.718
I know I've been here before.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.013
Evy, nobody's been here before,
not in at least 3,000 years.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.015
Except for these guys.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.731
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I'm going?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.248
Let's go.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.034
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.206
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.169
I'll sort out the O'Connells.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.556
If you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.392
I just had a vision.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.729
It was like my dream,
but it was real.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.232
It was like I was actually here
in ancient times.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.776
Well, if you actually were here...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.445
could you show me
how to open this thing?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.989
Hold this.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.966
- Now you're starting to scare me.
- I'm starting to scare myself.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.928
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.181
The Egyptians never had a clue.
Look at that stuff.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.642
It's all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.438
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.610
Jacques,
something's hit me head!

12:15.735 --> 12:16.777
Shut up, Spivey.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.613
This place is cursed.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.535
We do not want to wake the gods.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.643
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.146
He's supposed to be pure myth.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.149
No trace of him has ever been
found before. No artefacts.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.151
No archival evidence.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.237
Maybe they didn't want
anybody to find him.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.322
- Let's open this.
- Evy, I don't know.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.408
- I don't have a good feeling about this.
- It's only a chest.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.494
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.788
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.666
- Remember how that one went?
- Come on. We can't stop now.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.001
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.169
For once.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.046
Rubbish.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.340
Dreck. Chintz.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.889
God, that hurt!

13:45.825 --> 13:49.245
Hon? Let's do it your way.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.057
The bracelet of Anubis.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.359
I'll take care of this.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.201
Oh, my God.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.078
It's a bit late for that!

14:31.204 --> 14:34.415
- Put it in your rucksack.
- Let's leave it here.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.043
- It's a bit late for that!
- What's it say?

14:37.126 --> 14:40.004
"He who disturbs this bracelet...

14:40.129 --> 14:42.215
shall drink from the Nile."

14:42.298 --> 14:44.008
That doesn't sound too bad.

15:02.401 --> 15:06.614
Jacques is gonna make
a nice fillet out of you, my son.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.411
Spivey! Jacques!
Let's get the hell out of here!

15:13.746 --> 15:15.248
Come on.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.102
This is bad, Evy.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.396
- We've had bad before.
- This is worse.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.187
Mom? Dad?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.731
I can explain everything.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.636
The Book of the Dead gives life.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.639
And the Book of the Living...

17:39.392 --> 17:41.602
takes life away.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.646
I thought that was my job.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.442
We're getting close.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.850
Did you acquire it?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.172
We're getting very close.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.022
We found him.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.819
We found him! We found him!

20:11.711 --> 20:14.046
Step aside there.
Out of the way.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.928
Imhotep.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.972
It's him. It's Imhotep.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.313
Now we must raise
those that serve him.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.607
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.234
Get out of my way
or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.737
He means it.
He shot someone before.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.113
Give it to me.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.241
The opportunity passed us by.

20:43.493 --> 20:47.038
- We need that bracelet.
- We need it before it opens.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.835
Enough.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.465
My dear Hafez...

20:57.590 --> 21:00.468
I told you
I should have handled it.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.679
I did not want
your past history...

21:03.804 --> 21:05.389
to cloud the issue.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.767
Don't worry. We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.436
No, we'll take care of it.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.314
I have a different chore
for you now.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.483
Where is the bracelet?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
It's on its way
to merry old London.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.572
Then London is where we must go.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.801
<i>I think the bracelet</i>
<i>is some sort of guide...</i>

21:41.884 --> 21:43.970
to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.722
Evy, I know what you're thinking...

21:46.806 --> 21:48.516
and the answer's no.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.560
We just got home.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.063
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.316
Why don't you just give me
one good reason?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.443
It's just an oasis...

22:01.404 --> 22:02.780
darling.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.867
A beautiful...

22:05.950 --> 22:07.410
exciting...

22:08.661 --> 22:10.037
romantic...

22:12.832 --> 22:14.709
oasis.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.921
The kind with the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...

22:19.005 --> 22:21.048
and the cool, clear, blue water?

22:22.508 --> 22:25.636
We could have some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.891
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good. What's the catch?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.560
Supposedly it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.104
You see? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.106
How did I know that?
And let me guess.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.817
It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

22:39.942 --> 22:42.570
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.573
And if someone doesn't kill him,
he's gonna wipe out the world.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.618
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.621
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere...

22:51.704 --> 22:55.458
was sent by Ramses the Fourth
over 3,000 years ago.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.419
- He sent over a thousand men.
- None of them was ever seen again.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.505
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.757
- Did I mention the pyramid of gold?
- Twice.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.134
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.136
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.138
- Look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.516
Yeah, but we're smarter than him.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.184
- Taller too.
- Exactly.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.354
- That's why we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller?

23:17.813 --> 23:20.816
- That's why I love you.
- Nice try.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.214
Mom!

23:43.339 --> 23:45.383
What do I do with this chest?

23:45.508 --> 23:47.385
Sucker weighs a goddang ton.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.637
Alex, watch your language.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.347
Rather weighty, this.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.152
Evy, that first weird dream of yours
was exactly six weeks ago, right?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.280
Yes, but what's that
got to do with anything?

24:08.865 --> 24:11.993
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.080
That's right.
What a coincidence.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.292
Maybe.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.794
All I'm saying
is let's be cautious.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.098
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.330
You and Alex are the only thing
that matter to me.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.831
Well...

25:00.082 --> 25:03.461
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...

25:03.586 --> 25:05.963
to run the British Museum.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.775
Cripes, how do you get
this thing off?

25:25.858 --> 25:28.069
Have I kissed you today?

25:36.869 --> 25:39.247
I hate it when you do that.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.748
Why?

25:40.873 --> 25:43.876
- Makes me agree to anything.
- Anything?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.009
Those knickers are not mine.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.596
Jonathan.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.099
Alex, behave yourself
for five minutes, all right?

25:58.975 --> 26:00.393
You betcha.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.530
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn't be happier.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.074
It's the Year of the Scorpion.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.201
- Neat.
- Thought you might like that.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.497
So I killed the mummy and his minions
and stole his sceptre.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.541
Oh, you're so brave.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.585
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

26:25.668 --> 26:28.004
What do you think I'm doing here?

26:30.339 --> 26:33.843
- Sorry, we must be in the wrong house.
- You said this was your house.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.469
- I didn't.
- Call me!

26:37.346 --> 26:39.765
- You're not Sheila's husband?
- No.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.477
If you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.771
I don't know any Johnny.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.191
We are looking for
the bracelet of Anubis.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.027
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.820
Where is it?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.615
Ah, you're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

26:55.698 --> 26:58.034
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.162
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.832
Mr. O'Connell? Hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma...

27:04.957 --> 27:06.501
That bracelet.
Now I remember.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.879
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.928
It can't be.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.354
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?

27:26.479 --> 27:27.813
You mean Evy.

27:27.897 --> 27:31.067
I think she went off to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.445
The girl's a free spirit.
Did I mention I was single now?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.412
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

27:44.831 --> 27:45.915
It's downstairs.

27:45.998 --> 27:51.712
There's a safe.
The combination is 3-20-58.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.130
393-something.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.132
It's in the safe downstairs.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.801
I told you!

27:56.926 --> 27:58.469
And your point is?

27:58.594 --> 28:02.139
- I told you so you wouldn't kill me.
- When did we make that arrangement?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.570
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.864
Well, when you're popular...

28:17.947 --> 28:21.242
I'm serious. If you've lost
that key, you're grounded.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.328
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.248
Well, you better
start finding it then.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.750
I will, Mom.
There's nothing to worry about.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.545
Good evening.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.675
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.178
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.

28:42.555 --> 28:43.806
Give it to me now.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.770
Get out of my house.

28:49.896 --> 28:50.980
Whoa, Mom.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.482
- Maybe not the best idea.
- Alex, get back there.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.697
Definitely not the best idea.

28:59.822 --> 29:02.116
I think it's time
to yell for Dad now.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.161
- I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.374
Ardeth.
What are you doing here?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.460
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.128
Ardeth Bay.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.214
Lock-Nah.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.382
Hey, folks,
knowing my brother-in-law...

29:18.508 --> 29:20.635
he probably deserves whatever
you're about to do to him...

29:20.760 --> 29:22.136
but this is my house.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.305
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.228
Shoot him!

29:58.214 --> 30:00.174
Whoa, Mom!

30:00.299 --> 30:02.969
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I have no idea.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.226
That I learned from your father.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.438
I'll take that.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.659
Not bad for a Medjai.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.917
Let go!

30:43.759 --> 30:46.762
- What's in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!

31:01.611 --> 31:04.113
They must not get the bracelet.

31:04.197 --> 31:05.990
Get it and get out of here!

31:11.704 --> 31:13.623
Mom, look out!

31:14.540 --> 31:15.583
Evelyn!

31:34.477 --> 31:36.938
What'd you do this time?

31:37.063 --> 31:39.190
I haven't done anything
to anybody.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.610
- Lately.
- Come on!

32:04.257 --> 32:06.217
Rick!

32:07.260 --> 32:09.053
Look out, Rick!

32:18.771 --> 32:20.314
Dad! Dad!

32:21.691 --> 32:23.860
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

32:29.282 --> 32:31.993
What the hell are you doing here?
Scratch that. I don't care.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.162
Who are those guys
and where are they taking my wife?

32:34.287 --> 32:37.165
My friend, I'm not sure...

32:37.290 --> 32:38.749
but wherever this man is...

32:38.875 --> 32:41.252
your wife will surely be.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.673
Hey, I know him.
He's the curator.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.301
- He works at the British Museum.
- Are you sure?

32:48.384 --> 32:51.762
Better believe him. He spends more
time there than he does at home.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.142
Okay, you're here.
The bad guys are here.

32:56.225 --> 32:58.186
Evy's been kidnapped.
Let me guess.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.271
They once again removed
the creature from his grave.

33:00.396 --> 33:03.608
Not to point fingers, but isn't it your
job to make sure that doesn't happen?

33:03.733 --> 33:07.069
That woman with him knows things
no living person could possibly know.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.614
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.

33:09.739 --> 33:12.867
We hoped she would lead us to
the bracelet. She obviously did.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.535
Now they have it.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.538
I wouldn't get
too nervous just yet.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.500
Is that gold?

33:20.583 --> 33:22.502
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

33:22.585 --> 33:25.671
Then whoosh... straight across
the desert to Karnak.

33:25.755 --> 33:28.674
You have started a chain reaction that
could bring about the next apocalypse.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.345
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.347
You, get in the car.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.314
I am sorry if I alarmed your son,
but you must understand.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.274
Now that the bracelet's on...

33:45.358 --> 33:47.360
we have
7 days before the Scorpion King awakens.

33:47.443 --> 33:48.820
We? What we?

33:48.945 --> 33:51.614
If he is not killed,
he will raise the Army of Anubis.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.742
- I take it that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.078
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.209
<i>Whomever can kill</i>
<i>the Scorpion King...</i>

34:03.292 --> 34:05.211
can send his army back
to the Underworld...

34:05.294 --> 34:08.005
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.

34:08.130 --> 34:12.260
They dug up Imhotep 'cause he's tough
enough to take out the Scorpion King.

34:12.385 --> 34:13.511
That is their plan.

34:26.065 --> 34:29.777
Alex, I got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.196
- I could do that.
- Protect the car?

34:32.321 --> 34:35.241
Come on. Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.493
- I know.
- Dad!

34:38.578 --> 34:41.455
If you see anyone come running out
screaming, it's just me.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.958
Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.418
Now you're talking.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.507
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.

34:59.849 --> 35:03.644
If I were to say to you, I'm a stranger
travelling from the east...

35:03.769 --> 35:05.646
seeking that which is lost...

35:05.771 --> 35:08.316
Then I would reply that I am
a stranger travelling from the west.

35:08.441 --> 35:11.027
- It is I whom you seek.
- Then it is true.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.155
- You have the sacred mark.
- What, that?

35:14.280 --> 35:16.657
That got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.285
That mark means
you're a protector of man...

35:19.368 --> 35:22.330
a warrior for God, a Medjai.

35:22.455 --> 35:25.291
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.295
Mr. Hafez.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.177
They found him.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.899
Imhotep.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.520
Do not be frightened.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.939
I am not afraid.

39:03.676 --> 39:05.386
You know...

39:05.511 --> 39:10.016
a couple of years ago, this would've
seemed really strange to me.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.648
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.577
Where is it?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.954
Where is the bracelet?

39:32.788 --> 39:34.957
I think I know.

39:35.041 --> 39:39.253
At the very top of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.755
How huge?

39:40.838 --> 39:43.758
It was so big,
it would reflect the sun...

39:43.883 --> 39:46.093
and wink at distant travellers...

39:46.219 --> 39:49.013
beckoning them to their deaths.

40:09.158 --> 40:11.452
Get off! Get off!

40:15.164 --> 40:16.666
Oh, my God.

40:19.335 --> 40:21.879
You wait!
I'll put you in your grave again.

40:22.004 --> 40:25.007
Our thinking was, not if we
put you in your grave first.

40:26.843 --> 40:27.969
Burn her!

40:28.052 --> 40:29.220
You bast...

40:43.526 --> 40:46.070
- Open it! Open it!
- I'm trying!

41:07.466 --> 41:09.802
- Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!

41:11.053 --> 41:12.930
- You broke it!
- Be quiet!

41:13.055 --> 41:15.975
If there's gonna be any hysterics,
they'll come from me!

42:00.186 --> 42:01.729
Go, go, go!

42:17.370 --> 42:20.331
Oh, no. Not these guys again.

42:29.632 --> 42:32.051
What are we gonna do?

42:32.134 --> 42:34.929
You're asking me?
I'm only eight years old!

42:42.728 --> 42:45.982
Honey, what you doin'?
These guys don't use doors.

42:48.818 --> 42:51.070
Where the hell's Jonathan?

42:56.325 --> 42:58.202
- Alex!
- What's the matter with my car?

42:58.327 --> 43:01.122
I was forced to find an alternative
means of transportation.

43:01.247 --> 43:03.291
- A double-decker bus?
- It was his idea.

43:03.416 --> 43:04.542
- Was not!
- Was too!

43:04.667 --> 43:06.711
- Just go!
- It was too!

43:22.351 --> 43:24.937
No, not my car!

43:29.108 --> 43:31.402
Oh, I hate mummies.

43:31.527 --> 43:34.906
- Glad to see me now?
- Just like old times, huh?

45:14.463 --> 45:15.756
Turn, turn!

45:34.400 --> 45:36.027
No! Get out of the way!

46:05.598 --> 46:07.183
Look out!

47:09.829 --> 47:12.123
Great driving, Uncle Jon.

47:12.248 --> 47:13.583
Yeah.

47:19.672 --> 47:21.465
You all right?

47:21.591 --> 47:24.635
This was my first bus ride.

47:31.851 --> 47:35.396
- What would I do without you?
- Are all librarians this much trouble?

47:35.521 --> 47:36.981
Jeez, get a room.

47:50.870 --> 47:52.246
Let me go!

47:52.371 --> 47:53.789
Silence!

47:55.208 --> 47:57.001
Stop!

49:41.230 --> 49:44.358
Please do not fear
for your son, my friends.

49:44.484 --> 49:47.028
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.

49:48.321 --> 49:49.864
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

49:49.989 --> 49:53.075
When he put it on, he said he saw the
pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.

49:53.159 --> 49:56.579
At Karnak, the bracelet will show him
the next step of the journey.

49:58.164 --> 50:02.168
If we don't get to Karnak before them,
we won't know where to look for him.

50:02.251 --> 50:04.212
Seems to me...

50:04.337 --> 50:06.506
like we need a magic carpet.

50:25.191 --> 50:27.985
When Lord Imhotep last
encountered the O'Connells...

50:28.110 --> 50:31.572
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.

50:31.697 --> 50:35.284
As powerful as he will become,
he is still vulnerable.

50:35.368 --> 50:38.913
Only with the Army of Anubis
will he be invincible.

50:40.206 --> 50:42.458
He will need your help.

50:45.878 --> 50:47.672
Keep this with you always.

50:49.799 --> 50:52.134
The Book of the Dead!

50:52.218 --> 50:54.720
What a bright little child.

50:56.055 --> 50:58.766
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

50:58.891 --> 51:01.269
If you wish to see her again,
you'd better behave.

51:01.394 --> 51:03.855
Lady, I don't behave
for my parents.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.982
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you?

51:06.065 --> 51:07.150
Silence!

51:07.233 --> 51:11.612
Because your parents wouldn't slip
poisonous snakes into your bed...

51:11.737 --> 51:13.865
while you were sleeping.

51:14.657 --> 51:16.784
Lord Imhotep wishes
to meet the boy.

51:17.577 --> 51:21.497
Now we shall see
how brave you are.

51:21.581 --> 51:24.917
Hey, watch the suit.

51:25.001 --> 51:26.836
Ow! Me fingers.

51:28.171 --> 51:29.964
Nice.

51:33.176 --> 51:34.343
Very nice.

51:34.427 --> 51:36.470
Did you acquire what we asked?

51:36.596 --> 51:40.725
We acquired it, all right.
You know what?

51:40.850 --> 51:44.812
We had to kill two of those guards
at the mausoleum to acquire it.

51:44.937 --> 51:46.314
This chest is cursed.

51:48.941 --> 51:50.985
It says there is one...

51:51.110 --> 51:52.487
the undead...

51:52.612 --> 51:54.989
who will kill all those
who open this chest.

51:55.114 --> 51:59.076
Yes, and the creature will suck them dry
then become whole again.

51:59.202 --> 52:00.995
We've all heard this story before.

52:01.120 --> 52:04.832
Yeah, but I heard the Yanks
who found it nine years ago all died.

52:04.957 --> 52:07.126
Horrible deaths, they were.

52:07.210 --> 52:09.378
- So with that in mind...
- We want ten.

52:10.046 --> 52:11.506
Quiet!

52:14.300 --> 52:16.302
The agreement was for five.

52:16.385 --> 52:19.222
Well, we want ten
or we'll take it elsewhere.

52:19.305 --> 52:21.849
- If you...
- Ten will be just fine.

52:21.974 --> 52:23.351
Follow me, gentlemen.

52:25.645 --> 52:27.063
Get in.

52:49.168 --> 52:51.045
It is you
who are the chosen one...

52:51.170 --> 52:55.007
you who will take me
to Ahm Shere.

52:55.091 --> 52:59.262
What if I don't?
What if I get a little lost?

53:01.430 --> 53:04.100
You have strength, little one.

53:04.851 --> 53:09.188
You are your father's son,
but I know something you don't.

53:09.939 --> 53:11.858
This bracelet is a gift...

53:12.692 --> 53:14.861
and a curse.

53:14.944 --> 53:17.363
The sands of time...

53:17.446 --> 53:20.116
have already begun
to pour against you.

53:24.203 --> 53:26.247
Yeah, I already heard this part.

53:26.372 --> 53:28.416
From the minute
I put the bracelet on...

53:28.541 --> 53:31.085
seven days do I have
before the Scorpion King wakes up.

53:31.210 --> 53:33.546
Did you also hear that if you
do not enter the pyramid...

53:33.629 --> 53:36.090
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning...

53:36.215 --> 53:39.677
that the bracelet
will suck the life out of you?

53:39.802 --> 53:41.679
That part I missed.

53:41.804 --> 53:45.016
Hey, wait a minute. That means
I've only got five days left.

53:45.141 --> 53:49.353
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost, don't you?

53:49.479 --> 53:53.149
My dad is going to kick your ass.

54:00.072 --> 54:02.033
I do not think so.

54:06.746 --> 54:10.791
In here, gentlemen,
you shall receive your just rewards.

54:10.917 --> 54:13.085
No tricks now, woman.

54:13.169 --> 54:15.630
We're not givin' up this chest
till we're satisfied.

54:15.755 --> 54:19.217
Don't worry.
There is much satisfaction to be had.

54:28.267 --> 54:29.727
What's going on?

54:34.273 --> 54:38.069
This place is cursed.

54:38.194 --> 54:42.114
- What is it with you and curses?
- He ain't happy without a good curse.

54:42.198 --> 54:44.784
"This is cursed. That is cursed."

54:44.867 --> 54:46.911
Give it a rest, will ya?

54:49.789 --> 54:51.499
Christ!

54:59.799 --> 55:03.636
He wants you to open the chest.
Open the chest!

55:26.492 --> 55:27.785
Where'd he go?

55:27.910 --> 55:29.787
Where'd he go?

56:18.628 --> 56:22.006
- This is the magic carpet?
- It'll be fine. He's a professional.

56:24.717 --> 56:25.968
Izzy!

56:31.891 --> 56:33.684
He definitely remembers you.

56:33.809 --> 56:36.229
He's a little shy.
Jonathan, get our bags.

56:36.312 --> 56:39.273
- Oh, my hands are full.
- Now.

56:39.398 --> 56:41.734
- Right. I'll get the bags.
- I'll deal with the flight details.

56:43.402 --> 56:46.697
- Honey, you're not a subtle man.
- We don't have time for subtle.

56:49.575 --> 56:51.744
Izzy, come here.

56:53.079 --> 56:55.832
- Doesn't look happy to see you.
- Never turned me down yet.

56:55.915 --> 56:58.709
Whatever it is, whatever you need,
I don't care. Forget it, O'Connell.

56:58.835 --> 57:00.878
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot.

57:01.003 --> 57:04.549
Last time I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.

57:04.674 --> 57:07.802
- Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?
- Bank job?

57:07.927 --> 57:11.180
- It's not like it sounds.
- It's exactly how it sounds.

57:11.264 --> 57:13.516
I'm flying high,
hiding in the sun.

57:13.599 --> 57:16.519
The white boy here flags me down,
so I fly in low for the pick-up.

57:16.602 --> 57:18.729
The next thing you know,
I get shot.

57:18.855 --> 57:21.107
I'm lying in the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out...

57:21.190 --> 57:24.318
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.

57:24.443 --> 57:26.404
Belly dancer girl?

57:26.529 --> 57:28.990
- Izzy, I think you and I should talk.
- As long as I don't get shot.

57:29.115 --> 57:31.951
Quit your whining.
You're gonna get paid this time.

57:34.620 --> 57:37.582
Have you looked around here any?
What do I need money for?

57:37.707 --> 57:40.084
What the hell am I
gonna spend it on?

57:40.209 --> 57:42.879
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy's out there.

57:42.962 --> 57:45.256
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.

57:53.055 --> 57:55.057
If you give me that gold stick,
you can shave my head...

57:55.141 --> 57:57.268
wax my legs
and use me for a surfboard.

57:58.478 --> 58:00.980
Didn't we do that in Tripoli?

58:01.063 --> 58:04.233
Say, by the way,
when did you lose your eye?

58:05.651 --> 58:08.821
I didn't. I just thought
it made me look more dashing.

58:10.990 --> 58:12.658
Come on. Get to work.

58:13.743 --> 58:17.330
- You're not catching me at my best.
- Oh, I'm sure I am.

58:25.338 --> 58:28.299
I knew it.
I'm gonna get shot.

58:29.258 --> 58:31.928
These are the commanders
of the 12 tribes of the Medjai.

58:33.346 --> 58:34.931
Horus.

58:40.186 --> 58:41.813
Pet bird.

58:41.938 --> 58:43.606
My best and most clever friend.

58:43.689 --> 58:46.609
He will let the commanders know
of our progress so that they may follow.

59:04.794 --> 59:06.879
If the Army of Anubis arises...

59:08.297 --> 59:11.467
they will do all they can
to stop it.

59:11.551 --> 59:15.096
- Are you sure Izzy is reliable?
- Yeah, he's reliable-ish.

59:20.977 --> 59:23.938
- Isn't she beautiful?
- It's a balloon.

59:24.063 --> 59:25.773
It's a dirigible.

59:25.898 --> 59:28.901
- Where's your airplane?
- Airplanes are a thing of the past.

59:28.985 --> 59:31.237
- Izzy, you were right.
- I was?

59:31.320 --> 59:33.114
Yeah, you're gonna get shot.

59:34.073 --> 59:36.117
She's faster than she looks.

59:36.242 --> 59:37.827
And she's real quiet.

59:37.910 --> 59:41.914
Perfect for sneaking up on people,
which is a very good thing.

59:41.998 --> 59:44.041
Unless, of course,
we go with your approach...

59:44.167 --> 59:47.587
barging in face first, guns blazing,
gettin' your friends shot in the ass.

59:50.590 --> 59:53.551
Why can't you people ever
keep your feet on the ground?

01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:43.768
O'Connell does not want to believe,
but he flies like Horus to his destiny.

01:00:43.893 --> 01:00:47.730
Yes, very interesting.
Tell me more about this gold pyramid.

01:00:47.814 --> 01:00:50.441
It is written that since
the time of the Scorpion King...

01:00:50.566 --> 01:00:53.736
no man who has laid eyes upon it
has ever returned to tell the tale.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.447
Where is all this stuff written?
Hello!

01:00:58.741 --> 01:01:00.159
Got it.

01:01:05.414 --> 01:01:07.083
Pretty nice, eh?

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:09.460
This is all I have left
in the world.

01:01:09.585 --> 01:01:11.587
The rest of my fortune was lost...

01:01:11.671 --> 01:01:14.131
to some rather unscrupulous
characters, actually.

01:01:14.257 --> 01:01:17.802
If the curator reacted the way you say,
it must be very important.

01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:20.263
If I were you,
I would keep it close.

01:01:20.346 --> 01:01:23.975
My friend, the gods
couldn't take this away from me.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.685
- That's mine.
- No, it's not!

01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:30.940
Keep your hands off it.

01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:42.493
I want him back, Rick.

01:01:42.618 --> 01:01:44.662
I want him in my arms.

01:01:44.787 --> 01:01:46.164
I know.

01:01:48.207 --> 01:01:50.126
We taught him well.

01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:53.129
He's smarter than you.

01:01:54.213 --> 01:01:56.132
He's tougher than me.

01:01:56.215 --> 01:01:58.801
- I love him so much, I just can't...
- I know. We both do.

01:01:58.885 --> 01:02:00.678
Alex knows that.

01:02:02.638 --> 01:02:04.682
I'll get him back, Evy.
I promise.

01:02:04.807 --> 01:02:06.726
I know you will.

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:36.297
- Are we there yet?
- No.

01:02:48.518 --> 01:02:51.020
That was amazing.
Perfect aim.

01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:54.106
What are you talking about?

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:55.483
I missed.

01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:05.993
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:03:37.066 --> 01:03:39.026
Make it quick.

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:46.742
Hurry up.

01:03:50.746 --> 01:03:52.915
- Hey, reading material!
- Now!

01:03:58.171 --> 01:04:01.007
I can't go when someone's watching.

01:04:03.092 --> 01:04:05.761
I don't trust you.
You'll look.

01:04:14.437 --> 01:04:15.855
Darn!

01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:21.068
Oh, my God!

01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:24.405
Doesn't anyone around here know
how to flush a toilet?

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.050
Karnak.

01:06:06.465 --> 01:06:09.969
If a man does not embrace his past,
he has no future.

01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:11.429
Look...

01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:15.808
even if I was some sort
of sacred Medjai...

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:17.810
what good does that do me now?

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:20.021
It is the missing piece
of your heart.

01:06:20.146 --> 01:06:23.941
If you embrace it and accept it,
you can do anything.

01:06:24.066 --> 01:06:25.568
Sounds great.

01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:28.696
Listen, what can we expect
from our old friend Imhotep?

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:31.449
His powers are returning quickly.

01:06:31.574 --> 01:06:35.119
When he reaches Ahm Shere, even the
Scorpion King won't be able to stop him.

01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:38.983
Evy, I know you haven't been yourself
lately with these dreams and visions...

01:12:39.108 --> 01:12:41.777
No, they're memories
from my previous life.

01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:44.655
Honestly, I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.325
- That's why we found the bracelet?
- Exactly.

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:50.495
- I was its protector.
- Now do you believe, my friend?

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.914
Clearly, you were destined
to protect this woman.

01:12:53.039 --> 01:12:56.167
Right. She's a reincarnated princess,
and I'm a warrior for God.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:13:00.338
Your son leads the way to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:03.216
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.

01:13:03.299 --> 01:13:04.967
And how does the story end?

01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:07.720
Only the journey's written,
not the destination.

01:13:07.804 --> 01:13:08.888
Convenient.

01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:11.015
How else do you explain
Evy's visions?

01:13:11.098 --> 01:13:13.893
That it is your son
who wears the bracelet?

01:13:13.976 --> 01:13:16.646
- How do you explain your mark?
- Coincidence.

01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:21.025
My friend, there is a fine line
between coincidence and fate.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.130
Don't even think about it.

01:13:47.176 --> 01:13:49.762
Hold on there, partner.

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.892
When the time comes...

01:13:55.017 --> 01:13:58.729
I shall truly enjoy killing you.

01:13:59.605 --> 01:14:02.066
But until that time...

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.153
you'd better be
a little nicer to me.

01:14:05.278 --> 01:14:07.446
Now, where's my water?

01:14:11.701 --> 01:14:13.119
No ice?

01:14:17.748 --> 01:14:19.667
Make sure he doesn't move!

01:14:50.072 --> 01:14:52.533
They've gone.
We've lost them.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:21.270
Alex left us his tie...

01:15:21.395 --> 01:15:25.191
and he made us
a little sand castle.

01:15:25.274 --> 01:15:27.735
It's the Temple Island of Philae.

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.738
- They've gone to Philae.
- Attaboy, Alex. Come on!

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:45.294
The great temple of Abu Simbel.

01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:16.302
That's the Blue Nile down there.
We must be out of Egypt by now.

01:17:16.385 --> 01:17:20.264
In ancient times, all this
still belonged to the upper kingdom.

01:17:20.389 --> 01:17:22.600
The oasis must be
around here somewhere.

01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:25.603
Don't worry. We'll find him.
He's a smart kid.

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:27.647
He'll leave us a sign.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.779
Surprised to see me?

01:17:34.862 --> 01:17:37.198
Leaving bread crumbs, huh?

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.504
We're in trouble!

01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:47.602
Horus, fly!

01:18:51.314 --> 01:18:55.026
Izzy, come hard right!
Starboard! Starboard!

01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:40.863
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention?

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:46.828
People?

01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:07.849
Ahm Shere.

01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:19.485
Right.

01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:27.368
He's back!

01:20:31.247 --> 01:20:32.540
Hang on!

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.097
Well, that's not good.

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:51.392
Hang on!

01:20:58.232 --> 01:21:00.485
Mom?

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:02.695
Dad?

01:21:11.245 --> 01:21:13.122
We're gonna go get my son.

01:21:13.206 --> 01:21:16.125
Then we're gonna want to get out of here
fast, so make this work, Izzy.

01:21:16.209 --> 01:21:20.463
You don't understand. This thing was
filled with gas. Not hot air, gas.

01:21:20.588 --> 01:21:24.217
I need gas to get this thing in the air.
Where am I gonna get gas around here?

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.969
Bananas? Mangoes?
Tarzan's ass?

01:21:27.053 --> 01:21:30.306
Maybe I could finagle it
to take hot air.

01:21:30.389 --> 01:21:33.601
But do you know how many cubic meters
I'd need? It's too big!

01:21:33.684 --> 01:21:37.605
If anybody can fill this thing up
with hot air, Izzy, it's you.

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:45.822
Come to Daddy.

01:21:58.709 --> 01:22:01.003
So, Rick, what's the plan?

01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:02.922
Let's find some higher ground.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:31.242
- I must go.
- Where?

01:22:31.367 --> 01:22:33.578
To tell the commanders where we are.

01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:36.747
- If the Army of Anubis arises...
- I need you to help me find my son.

01:22:42.295 --> 01:22:45.715
Then first I shall help you.
Thank you.

01:23:24.253 --> 01:23:26.631
Look. Roman legionnaires.

01:23:28.758 --> 01:23:32.970
And here, turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.

01:23:33.054 --> 01:23:36.140
What in the name of Anubis did this?

01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:58.704
- You hear that?
- What?

01:23:59.872 --> 01:24:01.833
Nothing.

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.501
Absolutely nothing.

01:24:04.627 --> 01:24:07.839
My word!

01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:13.386
I say, chaps, look at this.

01:24:13.469 --> 01:24:17.265
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know how they do that.

01:24:20.059 --> 01:24:21.477
Just curious.

01:24:26.649 --> 01:24:28.860
You any good with that?

01:24:28.985 --> 01:24:32.530
Three times <i>Fox and Hound's</i>
grand champion. You any good with that?

01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:36.325
You'll know soon enough...

01:24:36.409 --> 01:24:40.621
because the only way to kill an Anubis
warrior is by taking off its head.

01:24:41.497 --> 01:24:43.624
I'll remember that.

01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:50.131
Try to remember to...

01:24:52.175 --> 01:24:55.094
just keep it tight
in the shoulder and...

01:24:56.679 --> 01:24:59.474
lead the target a little bit,
and then...

01:25:00.766 --> 01:25:02.810
squeeze the trigger...
don't pull it.

01:25:05.188 --> 01:25:07.064
I won't miss.

01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:47.355
Pyramid.

01:25:49.106 --> 01:25:51.526
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.

01:25:51.651 --> 01:25:54.403
Now may I kill him?

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.668
- Retrieve that bracelet.
- With pleasure.

01:26:35.111 --> 01:26:38.489
Something is coming.

01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:04.015
That's my husband
and my son down there.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.267
Make me proud.

01:27:06.642 --> 01:27:08.519
Today's that day, Evy.

01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:17.737
Where's the boy?

01:28:36.732 --> 01:28:38.317
The Black Book!

01:28:43.739 --> 01:28:45.324
Let's go!

01:29:14.937 --> 01:29:16.355
There you are!

01:29:18.774 --> 01:29:20.860
The time has come,
my little friend.

01:29:20.943 --> 01:29:23.112
Let go!

01:29:39.962 --> 01:29:42.924
- Dad!
- Alex!

01:30:03.486 --> 01:30:06.364
Time to remove that bracelet,
my good son.

01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:18.501
Behind you!

01:31:42.084 --> 01:31:44.962
- Let's go.
- Thank God for that.

01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:55.890
The two of you must
sacrifice yourselves for me.

01:31:56.933 --> 01:31:59.393
You shall be rewarded in heaven!

01:32:17.203 --> 01:32:18.621
Nice shootin', Tex.

01:32:18.704 --> 01:32:21.958
- What were those creepy pygmy things?
- Just the local natives.

01:32:22.041 --> 01:32:24.043
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. It was nothing.

01:32:24.126 --> 01:32:27.421
Come on, Mom. Come on, Dad.
We have to get to the pyramid.

01:32:27.547 --> 01:32:29.423
I have to get the bracelet off now!

01:32:29.549 --> 01:32:31.551
Leave it on.
Looks good on you.

01:32:31.634 --> 01:32:33.719
No, you guys, you don't understand.

01:32:33.803 --> 01:32:38.558
It'll kill me if I don't get inside
the pyramid before the sun hits it...

01:32:38.641 --> 01:32:39.684
today!

01:32:39.809 --> 01:32:41.644
Oh, my God.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.357
Time to go!

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.318
I thought you said
it was nothing!

01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:03.833
Where's Jonathan?

01:33:13.843 --> 01:33:16.721
Look! There's a burial ground!
We're safe! We're safe!

01:33:16.846 --> 01:33:19.182
They'll never cross
those sacred stones!

01:33:19.265 --> 01:33:22.435
- You are sure?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

01:33:37.366 --> 01:33:38.993
Sorry. My mistake.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.671
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up, Jonathan!

01:33:51.798 --> 01:33:53.591
Wait for me!

01:33:53.716 --> 01:33:57.178
- What's that for?
- Just something in case of an emergency.

01:34:19.826 --> 01:34:21.244
Let's go, Alex.

01:34:30.336 --> 01:34:33.756
Run! Come on, Alex, faster!

01:34:35.758 --> 01:34:38.010
Dad! The bracelet!

01:34:38.094 --> 01:34:40.429
Come on! Come on!

01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:04.745
You know...

01:35:04.871 --> 01:35:07.915
it's not easy being a dad.

01:35:09.292 --> 01:35:12.253
Yeah, but you do it really good.

01:35:13.379 --> 01:35:14.547
Thanks.

01:35:33.399 --> 01:35:36.402
They made it.
Thank God.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.655
Yes. Great.

01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:41.574
Fabulous.

01:36:10.603 --> 01:36:13.731
- She's going to be all right, isn't she?
- She'll be fine.

01:36:13.856 --> 01:36:15.274
Take him.

01:36:15.358 --> 01:36:17.068
Mommy's fine.

01:36:17.193 --> 01:36:18.528
It's okay.

01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:21.739
Your mother's
going to be fine. Okay?

01:36:23.032 --> 01:36:25.743
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it.

01:36:25.868 --> 01:36:27.161
You're fine.

01:36:28.287 --> 01:36:30.206
What do I do?

01:36:34.043 --> 01:36:36.295
Take care of Alex.

01:36:39.882 --> 01:36:41.300
Sweetheart, no.

01:36:43.386 --> 01:36:44.929
I love you.

01:37:02.238 --> 01:37:04.157
Come back, Evy.

01:37:07.076 --> 01:37:08.452
Come back.

01:38:35.915 --> 01:38:37.333
Stay here.

01:40:12.094 --> 01:40:14.847
Try to think of it
like this, Alex.

01:40:14.931 --> 01:40:17.350
She's gone to a better place.

01:40:17.433 --> 01:40:20.311
- Like it says in the good book.
- The book!

01:40:20.436 --> 01:40:22.230
- What?
- That's it.

01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:23.773
- That's it!
- That's what?

01:40:23.856 --> 01:40:27.068
Come on, Uncle Jon!
That's it! The book!

01:40:36.369 --> 01:40:38.538
You're too late, O'Connell.

01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:40.498
I have released
the Army of Anubis.

01:40:40.623 --> 01:40:43.918
Lord Imhotep shall soon
kill the Scorpion King...

01:40:44.043 --> 01:40:46.003
and take command.

01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:48.047
Not after I get through with him.

01:41:29.255 --> 01:41:32.216
You realize, of course,
that this can only be done...

01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:34.760
by someone who can actually read
ancient Egyptian.

01:41:34.844 --> 01:41:37.805
I don't know about you,
but I'm a tad rusty.

01:41:39.098 --> 01:41:41.517
- Now where?
- We go right.

01:41:41.601 --> 01:41:43.978
How do you know?

01:41:46.105 --> 01:41:49.525
Basically,
"This way to the Scorpion King."

01:41:51.027 --> 01:41:52.403
Mum taught me.

01:41:55.781 --> 01:41:57.700
This just might work.

01:42:28.731 --> 01:42:31.234
It's time someone taught you
a lesson, wench. Come on.

01:42:40.076 --> 01:42:41.661
This is for my sister.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.814
Is that all you've got?

01:45:25.241 --> 01:45:26.993
Hurry up, Alex!

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:24.342
Uncle Jon, I don't know
what this last symbol is!

01:46:24.467 --> 01:46:26.010
What's it look like?

01:46:26.135 --> 01:46:27.845
It's a bird. A stork!

01:46:30.306 --> 01:46:33.351
I know that one!
I know that one!

01:46:33.476 --> 01:46:35.394
Then what is it?

01:46:39.816 --> 01:46:41.234
That's it!

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.113
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

01:47:27.864 --> 01:47:28.990
Oh, my God.

01:47:29.115 --> 01:47:31.117
- Evy!
- Take Alex. Go and help Rick.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.244
- But, Mom...
- No "buts."

01:47:33.369 --> 01:47:34.287
Come on.

01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:39.792
I'll be just fine.

01:47:39.876 --> 01:47:41.878
- We did it, Uncle Jon!
- Right, partner.

01:47:41.961 --> 01:47:43.880
Now let's go help your dad.

01:49:46.502 --> 01:49:48.504
That's a little something new.

01:50:16.699 --> 01:50:18.868
My lord!

01:50:20.453 --> 01:50:22.371
Save me! Save me!

01:51:47.707 --> 01:51:50.001
Okay, now I'm a believer.

01:51:56.048 --> 01:51:57.133
It's a spear!

01:51:57.216 --> 01:51:59.927
The golden stick thing!
It's a spear!

01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:03.055
Really?
Doesn't look like a spear!

01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:05.766
That's because
it opens up into one!

01:52:05.892 --> 01:52:08.227
Yes? And?

01:52:08.311 --> 01:52:11.939
It opens up into a spear!

01:53:07.203 --> 01:53:09.747
- Twist it!
- Push!

01:53:09.872 --> 01:53:11.082
You have to pull!

01:53:13.793 --> 01:53:15.211
Jonathan, quick!

01:53:29.976 --> 01:53:32.645
Throw it!
Kill the Scorpion King!

01:53:32.728 --> 01:53:34.730
Send his army
back to the Underworld!

01:53:34.814 --> 01:53:37.733
Step aside, Alex.
I'm a professional.

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:45.301
Go to hell,
and take your friends with you!

01:56:22.648 --> 01:56:25.568
Get out of here!
Just get out of here!

01:56:46.756 --> 01:56:47.924
Hang on, Rick!

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.418
Let's go up!

01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:28.691
This whole damn place is gonna
get sucked up! Let's move up! Go!

01:58:42.121 --> 01:58:43.706
Go, Alex!

01:58:54.634 --> 01:58:56.552
Rick, we're trapped!

01:59:09.816 --> 01:59:13.820
Get your butts moving! Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!

01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:19.784
You're next! Go!

01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:29.252
Jonathan! Hold on!

01:59:29.335 --> 01:59:32.463
- Pull him up!
- Pull me up!

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:38.261
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!

01:59:38.344 --> 01:59:41.764
- It's not worth your life, you idiot!
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

01:59:44.767 --> 01:59:46.269
Right.

01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:56.237
Pull me up! Pull me up!

02:00:15.631 --> 02:00:19.177
- O'Connell, you almost got me killed!
- At least you didn't get shot.

02:00:21.554 --> 02:00:24.474
Thank you! Thank you!

02:00:28.478 --> 02:00:31.606
O'Connell, who the hell have you
been messing with this time, huh?

02:00:31.731 --> 02:00:32.982
You know, the usual.

02:00:33.065 --> 02:00:36.277
Mummies, pygmies...

02:00:36.402 --> 02:00:38.321
big bugs.

02:01:06.849 --> 02:01:09.769
I thought
I almost lost you there.

02:01:09.852 --> 02:01:11.771
For a moment there, you did.

02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:15.691
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

02:01:17.026 --> 02:01:18.486
Later.

02:01:22.532 --> 02:01:24.617
- Oh, please!
- Oh, please!

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.786
- That's half mine, you know.
- What?

02:01:26.869 --> 02:01:30.206
- That's half mine.
- What are you talking about?

02:01:30.289 --> 02:01:32.458
You took my gold stick!

02:01:32.542 --> 02:01:36.796
I swear on the head of my wife, I have
no idea what you're talking about.

02:01:36.879 --> 02:01:38.714
You ain't got a wife!

02:01:38.798 --> 02:01:41.217
I don't have
your gold stick either!
