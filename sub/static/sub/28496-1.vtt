You can call me Jennifer.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.960
LEROY: Hi, Jennifer.

01:03.962 --> 01:05.961
You describe in your book how

01:05.963 --> 01:09.666
just two weeks after the
horrible assault on you,

01:09.668 --> 01:11.934
you seduced the mentally
retarded Matthew

01:11.936 --> 01:14.571
to have intercourse
with you in the woods.

01:14.573 --> 01:17.773
Then you lured Johnny,
the leader of the gang,

01:17.775 --> 01:19.778
to have sex with
you in the bathtub.

01:20.778 --> 01:23.679
Those low-lives beat
the hell out of you,

01:23.681 --> 01:26.782
they savagely raped
and sodomized you

01:26.784 --> 01:29.051
and then left you for dead.

How could you chose to give
them, how shall I put it,

the ultimate pleasure of
life before you killed them?

to be as vulnerable as I was

01:38.763 --> 01:40.931
when they assaulted me.

01:40.933 --> 01:44.800
Naked, defenseless and helpless.

you let your body come again

advantage at my disposal

02:50.969 --> 02:52.739
was by God's given weapon,

02:53.638 --> 02:55.004
my sexual appeal.

No, Mom, actually I don't.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.098
You never have time for that.

wanted to talk about?

So what is there to be tired of?

06:33.692 --> 06:36.392
Tired of the
constant pressure.

06:36.394 --> 06:37.993
Tired of flying.

06:37.995 --> 06:39.796
I'm tired of airplane food.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.698
Tired of sleeping everyday
in a different bed

06:41.700 --> 06:42.969
in a different hotel.

06:44.069 --> 06:46.835
I'm tired of posing in
front of the cameras

06:46.837 --> 06:49.272
and cat walking every
day on a different ramp

06:49.274 --> 06:52.778
and not even knowing what
city, or even country, I'm in.

06:53.945 --> 06:55.378
I'm tired of wondering
what the people

06:55.380 --> 06:57.283
are really poking their eyes at.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.116
Is it the piece that I'm wearing

07:00.118 --> 07:01.921
or it is my ass and my tits?

07:03.187 --> 07:04.988
Let's face it, Mom,

07:04.990 --> 07:06.722
I'm nothing but a
fucking walking mannequin

07:06.724 --> 07:08.291
being used to sell a product.

07:08.293 --> 07:10.029
Who gives a damn, Christy?

07:11.128 --> 07:13.762
You got the look
that sells magazines,

07:13.764 --> 07:15.735
the body that sells clothes.

07:16.901 --> 07:19.137
That's why you're
being paid in gold.

07:21.072 --> 07:22.207
What else do you wish for?

07:24.075 --> 07:27.312
You must be very grateful for
everything you have, Christy.

07:28.245 --> 07:29.882
You never know in life.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.948
It can all suddenly change

07:32.950 --> 07:35.984
before there's time
to appreciate it.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.256
Mom, come on, you know
that I appreciate it.

07:39.356 --> 07:40.191
It's just,

07:41.392 --> 07:43.325
it just doesn't mean
much to me anymore.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.262
You know, I wanna do
something that challenges me,

07:46.264 --> 07:48.067
uses my brains.

07:49.334 --> 07:52.801
And, unlike you, I'd like to
find a nice guy who loves me

07:52.803 --> 07:56.972
and I love too, settle down,
have kids, get married.

07:56.974 --> 07:58.677
Four or five kids.

07:59.377 --> 08:01.013
Make you a grandma.

08:02.012 --> 08:03.014
Thanks, Christy.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.052
You warm my heart.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.852
You made me cry.

08:09.854 --> 08:10.689
Oh.

08:11.889 --> 08:14.356
You were only five
when you said to me,

08:14.358 --> 08:17.329
"Mommy, when I grow
up, can I be a model?"

08:19.029 --> 08:23.168
And I said, "Christy, you can
be anything you wanna be."

08:24.002 --> 08:25.237
And I say that now.

08:27.139 --> 08:28.074
Besides,

08:29.240 --> 08:31.810
modeling has a very
short shelf life.

08:33.344 --> 08:34.842
Thanks, Mom.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.846
Well now, I guess I
can tell you something

08:36.847 --> 08:38.313
that I couldn't before.

08:38.315 --> 08:39.150
Oh?

08:41.251 --> 08:45.321
I was offered half a
million to shave my head

08:45.323 --> 08:49.092
and pose for the cover of
a men's fashion magazine.

08:49.094 --> 08:50.360
And...

08:51.563 --> 08:54.467

if I do it topless.

Please don't tell me
what I think you said.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.101
I did.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.202
You devil, you.

09:00.204 --> 09:02.472
You turned it down.

09:02.474 --> 09:03.408
I'll be damned.

09:04.575 --> 09:06.342
Go tell them, for
a million bucks,

09:06.344 --> 09:10.947
I'll do it head shaven

12:51.036 --> 12:52.467
They came together
out of the rest...

12:52.469 --> 12:56.105

We couldn't help it,
Becky, she was there.

Pleased to meet you.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.629
I've seen you in loads
of ads and TV commercials

13:53.631 --> 13:55.134
since you were much younger.

13:56.501 --> 13:58.170
You used to smile then.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.647
And I've been watching you
lately on the runway too.

14:09.814 --> 14:13.519
You looking like a fucking
anorexic, sad walking mannequin.

14:14.618 --> 14:16.218
What did you expect, Becky?

14:16.220 --> 14:18.386

They wanna look like toothpicks.

14:20.358 --> 14:22.757
Yeah, don't you know?

14:22.759 --> 14:24.459
Starving is a way of life

14:24.461 --> 14:28.563
it'll fucking drive
all those smiles away.

14:28.565 --> 14:30.668
Why aren't you
fucking smiling no more?

as you think you are.

15:15.345 --> 15:16.180
You ain't!

15:35.767 --> 15:39.669
You are getting mighty famous

15:39.671 --> 15:41.772
and filthy rich

15:42.706 --> 15:44.707
on account of my
husband's blood.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.641
And the innocent blood

15:46.643 --> 15:48.944
of my dear brother, Stanley!

15:48.946 --> 15:51.816
And my cousin, Andy.

15:52.684 --> 15:53.685
He was like a big brother to me

15:54.551 --> 15:55.887
and she, she slaughtered him.

15:56.887 --> 15:58.623
Johnny loved me and the kids.

He was a good man.

Andy and Stanley
didn't go to church

16:06.330 --> 16:08.396
but they was good men too.

Matthew did.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.632
Mhmm, he went to church.

16:10.634 --> 16:12.334
Yeah but Matthew was a retard.

16:12.336 --> 16:13.836
He don't fucking count.

16:13.838 --> 16:15.240
Retards do count.

16:21.345 --> 16:24.182
Johnny was always
faithful to me

16:25.483 --> 16:29.655
Until you, like a bitch in heat,

16:30.754 --> 16:32.557
came along and seduced him.

butcher him, didn't it?

I can imagine what a
thrilling fucking moment

16:47.805 --> 16:48.839
that was for you.

16:50.842 --> 16:54.577
But the kick you got
from cutting off his dick

16:54.579 --> 16:56.681
was just the foreplay.

16:58.049 --> 16:59.218
You got hotter

17:00.884 --> 17:01.518
and hotter

17:04.622 --> 17:07.792

17:09.026 --> 17:10.962

17:36.853 --> 17:39.458
until you felt in
fucking seventh heaven.

17:42.826 --> 17:44.729
That's why you
killed him, isn't it?

17:46.698 --> 17:50.669

17:54.372 --> 17:56.374
Life is a bamboozling journey.

And we don't fucking know

18:00.344 --> 18:02.644
when in how we'll die.

18:02.646 --> 18:06.350
We can just wish it
won't be fucking painful

18:07.818 --> 18:11.389
as the horrible deaths you
inflicted on your victims.

18:14.825 --> 18:15.861
You

18:17.527 --> 18:19.695
made goddamn sure

18:19.697 --> 18:21.733
that each of them
died painfully.

18:23.767 --> 18:26.004
But the way you
let my husband die,

their ain't no fucking way
more painful than that!

willingly to his death

fucking resurrected!

week to bury him.

to go into his grave

you do with it?

river and the fishes ate it.

Christ, where are you?

02:17:11.154 --> 02:17:13.924
(GUN CLICKING)

02:17:16.059 --> 02:17:18.925
What am I to do now without you?

02:17:18.928 --> 02:17:20.998
(CRYING) What? What?

02:17:38.781 --> 02:17:39.918
Go ahead, child.

02:17:43.219 --> 02:17:44.555
Do what you gotta do.

02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:49.057
But first let me say a prayer.

02:17:49.058 --> 02:17:50.661
A prayer to save you.

02:17:51.661 --> 02:17:53.594
To free you of the evil spirits

02:17:53.597 --> 02:17:55.933
that dwell in your
body and soul.

02:17:57.567 --> 02:17:58.570
Or else, you,

02:17:59.936 --> 02:18:00.736
like your mother,

02:18:02.239 --> 02:18:04.975
will be lead straight
into Satan's kingdom.

02:18:06.109 --> 02:18:08.075
Oh, you say a
pray for yourself,

02:18:08.077 --> 02:18:13.114
you goddamn miserable old fool!

02:18:13.116 --> 02:18:15.052
Why don't you repent?!

02:18:15.718 --> 02:18:16.187
You!

02:18:19.623 --> 02:18:21.125
No prayer for you, child.

02:18:24.027 --> 02:18:25.129
You ain't deserve it.

02:18:29.633 --> 02:18:31.299
Because you're doomed.

02:18:31.302 --> 02:18:35.272
Doomed to the
everlasting fire of hell.

02:18:38.008 --> 02:18:40.077
(CRYING)

02:18:41.712 --> 02:18:44.780
My life ain't worth
no goddamn shit now

02:18:44.781 --> 02:18:46.784
without my beloved wife.

02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:49.520
Ain't worth no goddamn shit.

02:18:52.156 --> 02:18:53.754
Now go ahead.

02:18:53.757 --> 02:18:54.725
Pull the trigger.

02:18:55.793 --> 02:18:56.627
Pull it.

02:18:58.227 --> 02:19:02.228
Keep us together in
death as we was in life.

02:19:02.231 --> 02:19:05.602
Dispatch us to the
Kingdom of Heaven.

02:19:08.204 --> 02:19:09.106
Oh, I will.

02:19:11.275 --> 02:19:12.544
First,

02:19:13.843 --> 02:19:16.013
you gotta keep
your promise to me.

02:19:17.246 --> 02:19:20.050

02:20:06.329 --> 02:20:08.198
You be good to old Lucy, here.

02:20:10.133 --> 02:20:11.301
She don't need much.

02:20:14.104 --> 02:20:16.203
Just dump plenty of
Mobile 1 down her throat

02:20:16.205 --> 02:20:18.239
to quench her thirst.

02:20:18.241 --> 02:20:19.344
She'll keep on going.

02:20:20.711 --> 02:20:22.145
They don't make them
like this no more.

02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:28.219
I kept my promise, young lady.

02:20:29.886 --> 02:20:31.188
It's your turn to keep yours.

02:20:52.742 --> 02:20:53.410
So be it.

02:20:57.114 --> 02:20:59.714
Forcing a man to go on living
without his beloved wife

02:20:59.716 --> 02:21:02.754
aint but a cruel and
heartless punishment, child.

02:21:03.954 --> 02:21:07.125
It's all in these
Almighty's hands, all.

02:21:08.292 --> 02:21:10.192
Reckon He wishes
me to go on living

02:21:10.194 --> 02:21:11.425
because He wants me to witness

02:21:11.427 --> 02:21:14.431
the day His wrath
descends upon you.

02:21:15.933 --> 02:21:18.236
The mighty wrath of God.

02:21:20.237 --> 02:21:23.938
May God have mercy on you,

02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:25.309

I did what I did.

02:22:28.238 --> 02:22:30.508

02:22:31.207 --> 02:22:33.111
