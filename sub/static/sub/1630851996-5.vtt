We both know what it is
to have so little to cling to.

when he died.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.122
What did you see?

17:20.205 --> 17:22.499
- Every night,

17:22.583 --> 17:25.502
I dream his death as my own.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.004
I have other dreams, too,

17:27.087 --> 17:29.715
where I am, Kazu,
worrying about you.

17:31.425 --> 17:35.429
Between us, there's
a lot of Kazu still here.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.477
- He got good
at sharing at the end.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.270
Those things.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.982
Kazu told me if he saw himself
trapped in Holons, like Chase,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.651
he couldn't rest
until they were at peace.

17:49.735 --> 17:54.865
