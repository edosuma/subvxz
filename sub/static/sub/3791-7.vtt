01:17.494 --> 01:18.745
So let me get this straight:

01:18.829 --> 01:21.497
You wake up snuggling
a girl that you didn't even get to fuck?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.499
I'm not repeating
myself again.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.461
- It's disgusting.
- What is disgusting about that, Drama?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.087
What's disgusting
is the only reason

01:28.172 --> 01:30.423
a guy should be forced
to snuggle a girl

01:30.507 --> 01:32.717
is if he's allowed
to fuck her first.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.886
Or at least if she promises
she'll fuck him later.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.180
- Who snuggles in a threesome anyway?
- Question.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.224
- Who uses the word snuggle?
- E and E.

01:40.309 --> 01:43.019
Men spoon, E.
Women snuggle.

01:43.479 --> 01:44.687
I'm glad you're in
on this too, Vince.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.272
What?
Come on, it was funny.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.816
Besides, I just got fired.
I need a good laugh.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.068
Well, you can laugh in the car.
I promised Sloan

01:51.153 --> 01:53.112
I'd look at her setup for tonight.
I want you guys to come.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.614
We're going to her
charity event tonight,

01:54.698 --> 01:56.157
why do we have to go
again this morning?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.701
Because Tori'll be there and it'll
be freakin' awkward.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.203
If you guys are there I can say we're
going to lunch,

02:00.287 --> 02:01.287
otherwise I might get stuck.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.415
Okay, fine, E.
If you need us to go, we'll go.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.375
Okay?
Right, guys?

02:06.710 --> 02:09.252
- Yeah, of course.
- All right, we'll go.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.007
We'll go. But what
you really need, E,

02:13.091 --> 02:15.551
is a good snuggle.
Get over here!

02:20.390 --> 02:23.434
Just checking in, Eric,
wanted to see how our boy is holding up.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.812
He wants to know
how you're doing.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.147
Well, besides the fact
that the "L.A. Times" compared me

02:28.232 --> 02:30.191
to Terrell Owens, I'm doing great.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.860
- You hear that, Ari?
- Yeah, the Eagles got rid of T.O.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.153
And look where they landed.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.656
"Aquaman 2" is gonna
make "Speed 2"

02:36.740 --> 02:38.616
look like
"Citizen fucking Kane. "

02:38.742 --> 02:41.369
All right, you tell Vince
we will bounce back.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.455
You can tell him yourself
at Sloan's event tonight, right, Ari?

02:45.207 --> 02:46.916
Ah, come on, Ari.
It's for a good cause.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.209
Help her out.
It would mean a lot to me.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.753
I get hard thinking about the fact
that you actually like me, E.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.839
However, I am sitting down
with your father-in-law

02:52.923 --> 02:54.173
for the first time in nine months.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.968
If all goes well,
I promise you

02:57.052 --> 03:00.763
that I will try to show up if you
promise me not to wear any panties.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.765
- Bye, Ari.
- Bye, Eric.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.478
- Ari!
- I hoped you sharpened your fangs, Bar,

03:07.563 --> 03:09.438
because it is go time.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
Hold that!

03:12.276 --> 03:13.234
Terrance.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.112
Ari, you look a little haggard.
Everything all right?

03:16.238 --> 03:18.614
It's called aging, Terrance.
Not everyone can stay young

03:18.699 --> 03:20.658
by sucking the blood
of their employees.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.828
Gentlemen, let's keep
this civil. I suggest...

03:23.912 --> 03:26.956
Ari, you and I are both
born negotiators.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.834
So let's keep the legal eagles
out of this, shall we?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.335
- Absolutely.
- Good.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.504
Now, in the interest
of putting this

03:33.589 --> 03:36.048
whole sordid mess
behind us,

03:36.133 --> 03:38.050
I think you'll find
this offer very generous.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.470
We've been here before.
You know what? Save a tree,

03:41.847 --> 03:42.847
say it out loud.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.767
I'm prepared to offer you

03:46.852 --> 03:48.477
$4 million.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.563
Four?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.651
Okay, first let me counter
by saying "Fuck you. "

03:56.194 --> 03:57.528
You see,
while you were off

03:57.613 --> 04:00.573
on your eight-year
"sabbatical"...

04:00.657 --> 04:01.908
sailing, duck hunting,

04:02.159 --> 04:04.035
whatever the fuck
it is you do...

04:04.119 --> 04:07.663
I took that agency
from the midlevel shithole it was

04:07.748 --> 04:09.916
to the powerhouse
it currently is

04:10.334 --> 04:13.252
- and I can prove it.
- And I thought I had an ego.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.379
You want to go
to court? Let's.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.005
I got nothing but time.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.301
Or have you forgot I got a very rich
wife who loves to spoil me.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.677
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.721
Wait.

04:26.642 --> 04:27.642
10 million.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.436
- 12 million.
- Fine.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.688
- 11 it is.
- You got yourself a deal.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.401
Thank fucking God!

04:37.486 --> 04:39.320
Yeah!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.280
Way to earn your commission
in there, Bar.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.078
So what's your
opening line gonna be?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.996
- Fuck off.
I don't think they'll like that.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.083
Just make sure you say hello to Sloan
first, everything will be fine.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.627
- Thanks for that tip, Drama.
- Look, if you don't want us here...

04:54.711 --> 04:56.379
Just get in here.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.678
- Hey.
- Hi, baby, how are you?

05:06.765 --> 05:08.849
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.979
- Hi, guys.
- What's up?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.105
Hey.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.609
- The place looks amazing.
- Yup.

05:19.027 --> 05:19.986
Thank you.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.113
Yeah, you guys really
work well together.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.700
So, Sloan,
I think it's great

05:25.784 --> 05:27.493
what you're doing here and I just want
to say if there's anything

05:27.577 --> 05:29.412
I can do to help tonight,
I'm down with the cause.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.247
Really? Anything?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.124
- Anything.
- That is great,

05:33.208 --> 05:35.793
because we're supposed to auction off
a dinner date with Zach Braff,

05:35.919 --> 05:38.004
but he literally
just bailed.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.213
Anything else?

05:40.257 --> 05:42.967
- No, that's it.
- Whatever you need.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.845
Thank you so much.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.556
Oh, the flower guys.
Hold on one second.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
Hello.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.226
Yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah...

05:53.478 --> 05:56.647
I'm gonna go back to the hotel and work
on my tan, so I'll see you guys later.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.857
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.358
- Peace.
- Goodbye, Eric.

05:59.609 --> 06:00.776
Later.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.487
Ooh yeah.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.198
Jesus, and you thought
you wanted to get in and out fast.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.658
- She was cold, right?
Cold?

06:07.743 --> 06:10.578
She ran from you like a chicken
with a bad cough.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.039
- What does that mean?
- It's an avian flu reference.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.623
Oh, good one.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.792
This is not good.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.503
E, I don't know what
you're obsessing about.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.838
She thinks I'm a freak.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.716
You hit her with the unsolicited
snuggle, you are a freak.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.802
You know what, take me home. I'm gonna
drive over to her hotel and apologize.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.681
What? Apologize?
For snuggling her?

06:30.766 --> 06:32.808
For invading her space.
I don't know.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.643
You're a sensitive guy, E.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.396
- It's kinda queer.
- Whatever.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.565
You know what, Drama?
He is sensitive.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.983
Maybe we should
all go with him.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.569
Thanks, Turtle, but I don't
need support on this one.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.781
Wasn't going for support. Was going
to see Tori's ass in a bathing suit.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.794
Ah, the girls
from Wisteria Lane.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.046
Which one of you is hiding a large
black man in your basement?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.048
Funny, Ari.
What are you doing here?

07:04.633 --> 07:07.218
I came here to tell you, honey,
that our marriage is a sham

07:07.302 --> 07:09.261
and the last 15 years
have meant nothing.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.972
- What are you talking about?
- I came here to tell you

07:12.057 --> 07:14.558
that I want it to actually
mean something this time.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.353
Oh my God!

07:18.271 --> 07:19.772
- Ari!
- Let me put it on you, baby.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.440
- Oh my God.
- Look at that.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.275
Whip 'em out, ladies.
Let's see who's got the biggest.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.778
- I take it the meeting went well.
- It went well, baby.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.698
Let me show you how well it went.
I'm stealing the bride-to-be, everyone.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.867
- Where are we going?
- It's a secret.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.745
Lunch is on me provided that Joyce,
you still have your stomach stapled.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.541
Fuck you, Ari. Just for that I'm
ordering a bottle of Cristal.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.585
The new Gold Standard.
It's gonna make the Endeavor building

07:41.670 --> 07:43.712
look like a fucking
Dunkin' Donuts.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.673
Oh my God,
it is huge.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.842
It'll house 150 agents.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.261
All of whom, if they're
sexually harassed,

07:50.345 --> 07:52.721
have only one person
to sue... me.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.808
Ari, can we afford this?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.310
Baby, listen, we've been
planning this for nine months.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.896
With this money all
the pieces are in place.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.941
I know you're scared.
But it's time.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.484
Just say yes.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.237
Yes.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.490
Let's go take a lap
in the executive Jacuzzi.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.992
- You've got a Jacuzzi in here?
- Not yet,

08:13.076 --> 08:14.451
- but they'll put one in.
- No, they're not.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.120
- We could talk about it.
- We just did.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.330
- I don't know. Maybe I can bribe you.
- Here?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.999
Ari, are you out
of your mind?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.125
Oh!

08:39.227 --> 08:42.770
- Eric. Yo, what's up, E?
- Hey, Seth. What's going on?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.690
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.943
How's Vince, man? I can't believe
they fired him. That is brutal.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.779
It's for the best really.
Frees us to do other projects

08:50.864 --> 08:52.698
- we're more interested in.
- Good.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.116
Sorry about your show
getting canceled.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.118
Oh yeah, what are you
gonna do, man?

08:56.203 --> 08:59.330
Nobody believed that four guys in their
30s were gonna live together.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.874
Yeah, well I lived
at the guest house until last year.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.086
You get moved up to the maid's quarters
now? I'm kidding.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.546
How's Sloan?

09:07.631 --> 09:08.672
She's good.
You know Sloan?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.674
Yeah, I know Sloan.
She's a great girl, man.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.301
- Yeah.
- You guys doing all right?

09:12.385 --> 09:15.554
- Yeah, good. I'll tell her you said hi.
- You should.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.974
- Eric?
- Hey, Tori.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.559
Oh, excuse me.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.355
- It's not what it looks like, Seth.
- It never is, man.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.023
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.107
Can we get a drink?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.402
Um, yeah, sure.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.699
All right, look, I just wanted to come
by and apologize.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.369
- For what?
- For the other day.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.497
- You know, the way we woke up.
- You mean the way I woke up.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.540
Yeah. It was completely
unintentional.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.584
Well, obviously,
I mean, you were sleeping.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.295
Exactly. I was
as surprised as you were.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.422
But I just prefer
if we didn't tell Sloan.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.592
I mean, she might think it was weird.
I mean, it was a little weird, right?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.095
Well, I mean,
actually waking up

09:56.179 --> 09:57.888
with you spooning me
was kind of funny

09:57.973 --> 10:01.517
but I think Sloan would think it was a
lot weirder that you're here right now.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.020
Well, the only reason
I came here was to apologize.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.856
I hope so.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.276
Why else would I be here?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.986
Eric, I have no idea.
I hardly know you.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.697
But let me tell you
something about me.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.573
The other night was fun
and nothing more.

10:16.992 --> 10:17.950
I know.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.036
And Sloan is a really good friend
of mine and she's your girlfriend

10:21.121 --> 10:25.541
so you just being here behind her back
is making me totally uncomfortable.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.044
Sorry.
Fine.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.963
I can't believe
we just did that.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.632
What? It was like freshman year
at the Z.B.T. House.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.427
We didn't do it freshman year
at the Z.B.T. House, Ari.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.929
You're right.
It was Amy Myers.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.764
You fucked Amy Myers?
Oh my God.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.807
You're gonna get mad about it?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.059
It was 20 years ago and you
landed the big prize.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.437
- I did.
- I love you. Come here.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.690
Oh my God, Ari!
What the hell?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.150
- I think that was Adam Davies.
- Who?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.652
It's that rat-fuck that screwed me
with Terrance last year.

10:53.737 --> 10:57.197
- So what?
- So? Is that rock fucking blinding you?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.325
If Terrance knows
that I'm taking the big space

10:59.409 --> 11:01.285
he'll know that I'm
starting the big agency.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.912
So what's the difference
if he knows?

11:04.706 --> 11:06.540
- Oh my God, we don't have the money.
- We have an agreement.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.375
Baby, it's all...
He didn't see anything. It's all good.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.711
- Get me up.
- Don't worry about it.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.130
What the fuck was that?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.009
My wife lost
a contact, Davies.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.594
Why don't you pop out
and help us?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.221
Maybe I'll give you a little curbing
when you're on your knees.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.515
You'd love to see me with something
hard in my mouth, huh, Ari?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.684
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.644
He brings it out of me.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.104
Later.

11:29.981 --> 11:30.981
What, baby?
It's all good.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.108
He doesn't suspect a thing.
Come on.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.778
- She basically called me a stalker.
- Basically?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.447
From snuggler to stalker.
Sounds like an M.O.W.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.700
Girls have a tendency
to throw that term around, E.

11:41.785 --> 11:42.910
I wouldn't sweat it.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.079
The only reason I went down there
was to apologize.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.206
Which I didn't understand
in the first place.

11:47.290 --> 11:52.044
Vince, let's for a moment just assume we
understand the reason for the apology.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.047
- Why to her?
- Yeah, E, why to her?

11:55.131 --> 11:57.466
- Yeah, why her?
- What do you mean?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.927
I mean if anything you should
be apologizing to Sloan.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.679
Exactly. After all, she was the one
you weren't snuggling with.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.390
Maybe there's another reason
you went down there.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.975
Maybe there's a reason
behind the snuggle.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.811
Oh no.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.815
Did E fall in love
during a threesome?

12:12.899 --> 12:16.026
If anyone could do it, it's E.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.071
You're like a chick. I mean, the guy
cannot have unemotional sex.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.739
- I didn't have sex.
- Whatever.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.075
You can't whack off
without weeping.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.245
I went down there for no other reason
than to say that I'm sorry

12:26.329 --> 12:28.163
and apologize
for cuddling

12:28.248 --> 12:30.332
or spooning
or whatever, Drama.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.959
It was unintentional.
It was an accident.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.545
Freud says there
are no accidents.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.008
You guys crossed swords
during your threesome. Accident?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.557
Yo yo, Eric Murphy.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.934
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- I'm coming.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.979
I can't believe I'm the one
telling you that.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.772
- Yo.
- Yo.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.026
- Never mind.
- Come on, what's up?

12:59.154 --> 13:00.779
I can't stop
thinking about Tori.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.823
It makes me sick.
I feel guilty.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.867
Jesus.
Really?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.035
I was just kidding.
You're really into her?

13:07.412 --> 13:12.082
No, it's just that when we were doing
our whole, you know, thing,

13:12.167 --> 13:13.333
I wanted her.
Bad.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.377
So?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.503
More than I wanted Sloan.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.298
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.678
E, you had a threesome. Any guy's gonna
want what he's never had during that.

13:24.971 --> 13:25.971
I still want her.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.849
You were this close to having her.
It was a big tease.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.559
If you would have had it
it'd be over now.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.394
- You think?
- Absolutely.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.564
And here's the good news.
She's not into you.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.442
She thinks you're a stalker.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.738
She was probably wanting the whole
threesome thing just to get to Sloan.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.074
And she lives 3000 miles away so just
get through the night and it's over.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.118
It should be a good one.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.913
Hey, I'm the one who's being sold
like I'm on eBay.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.504
It could be fun, Vince.
Like that time you got auctioned off

13:58.588 --> 14:01.215
- for the Feed the World event.
- Jesus, remember that Cuban guy

14:01.299 --> 14:03.509
who bought me and wanted me
to come live with him in Havana?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.886
Guy never sent me those cigars
he promised. I should call.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.680
Ask if he knows any good lefties for
the Yanks bullpen while you're at it.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.015
Great mother of God.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.893
Oh, she cleans up good, huh?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.271
Just get through the night.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.942
Hey, guys.
Hey!

14:20.026 --> 14:22.611
Thank you so much
for coming. Hi.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.655
- Things look like they're going well.
- They are.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.032
They're about to get even better.
Vince, come with me?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.867
Let's show the ladies what
they're bidding on.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.702
- I thought it was a silent auction.
- It is.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.455
But I've got to present
the merchandise.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.292
Let's go get a drink.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.420
Where do you want to go?
French Riviera, St. Barts,

14:40.505 --> 14:43.507
- Australian outback?
- No more spending, Ari.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.300
Not until we're
in the clear.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.303
We are in the clear, baby.
I don't know why I panicked.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.389
Davies saw us
in the middle of the street.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.224
What does that mean to him?
Absolutely nothing.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.393
Pick a vacation
destination.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.311
No more spending, Ari.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.982
It's charity.
Come on, it's a tax write-off.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.068
You know what?
I'm gonna bid on all of them.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.119
- How are you, mate?
- Cheers, Ari.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.832
Prick.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.460
All I'm saying is me
and a girl like Tori

15:20.545 --> 15:23.505
are wild kindred
free spirits.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.675
I'd never want to go
where you've been, E,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.136
but since you never
actually got there,

15:29.220 --> 15:30.762
you mind if I try it
on for size?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.180
You tried the other night,
Drama, no luck.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.766
I'm with E.
You got no shot, Drama.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.894
Look, I'm not gonna debate
whether or not I can get the girl.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.730
I'm only asking
if E would care.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.274
- I have a girlfriend.
- Then just say you don't care.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.486
- You can't say it.
- I don't care.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.822
Sweet.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.741
Yeah, well,
here she comes.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.201
- She looks angry.
Good, I like it mean.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.746
Makes taming them
a greater challenge.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.039
Just relax.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.166
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.709
Hi there.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.880
- Um, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.968
And now our featured item
of the evening:

16:10.678 --> 16:13.847
A lovely night of dinner and dancing
under the stars...

16:13.931 --> 16:15.891
- Dancing?
- One dance.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.227
...the dashing
Vincent Chase, everybody.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.277
Here he comes.
Vincent.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.446
Vincent Chase,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.241
Come on, ladies,
there he is...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.661
as handsome off screen
as he is on screen...

16:35.745 --> 16:38.664
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off as harsh earlier.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.708
You were right. I shouldn't have come
to your hotel.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.834
Yeah, well I was
kind of cold

16:43.044 --> 16:45.504
and I probably made you feel
like something was wrong

16:45.588 --> 16:48.465
but I know that you're
a good guy, Eric.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.384
I knew that...

16:50.468 --> 16:52.886
Even before you
so lovingly embraced me.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.847
Jesus. I haven't done
a lot of these. You?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.309
A few more than you.
But not a lot.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.105
So how were we?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.691
Well, I don't know
about you...

17:05.775 --> 17:07.401
Well, Sloan and her rules.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.609
Yeah.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.070
We'll get her to drop
those rules tonight

17:11.155 --> 17:13.781
and I'll make a later flight.
We'll try again.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.618
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.094
Ladies, this is your chance
to spend the evening

17:34.178 --> 17:36.304
with a real live superhero.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.057
So put your bid
in now or lose out.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.395
- You owe me big time.
- I know I do.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.021
Can I sample the goods?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.733
- I'm selling stock to get you.
- Wow.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.235
If I pay more, can I keep
you for the weekend?

17:50.319 --> 17:53.071
You know what?
We'll discuss it with your husband.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.240
- You seem like a hot ticket tonight.
- I feel like an iPod.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.118
- Hey, will you buy me?
- I don't think I could afford you.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.578
I could loan you
the money.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.956
It's exquisite.
It's so unlike you.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.084
- Well...
- I must compliment Ari.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.502
God, this must have
cost a fortune.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.882
Well actually,
it's just a C.Z.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.009
Oh...

18:14.677 --> 18:17.304
- Don't tell anyone.
- No. Never.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.312
What?

18:25.396 --> 18:27.773
I can't believe I had to tell
that bitch this was a fake.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.150
You didn't have to do that.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.235
I thought we were keeping
the money a secret.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.654
No, Terrance knows
we have money.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.449
- He gave it to me.
- How the fuck am I supposed to know?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.910
You have me so confused. I don't like
secrets, I don't like lying.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.871
Office space.
You just can't say office space.

18:43.873 --> 18:44.873
Well...

18:58.346 --> 19:00.347
Yeah, I thought
about tattoos a couple times,

19:00.431 --> 19:02.474
but I could never really
decide on one.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.060
Me either.
That's why I have four.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.104
Really?
I thought I spotted one.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.857
The rest are hiding.

19:11.734 --> 19:12.734
Huh.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.157
Will you excuse me
for one second?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.159
I will be right back,
I promise.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.410
Okay.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.916
Psst.
Hey.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.336
- You're spinning like a top out there.
- I've got to get out of here.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.338
- Why, what happened?
- I can't be around this girl.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.924
E, come on,
we went over this.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.260
She wants another go around.
This time no rules.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.679
- Wow, that's nice.
- No, it's not nice.

19:40.763 --> 19:41.847
I don't want
another go around.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.682
Not with Sloan there,
you mean.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.643
I don't know what it is.
I got something crazy for this girl.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.645
I told you what it is.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.273
Either way, I want to grab her, I want
to take her in the coatroom.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.608
Come on, E.
You're not a coatroom kind of guy.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.194
Exactly. I'm not a threesome kind
of a guy either. That's the problem.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.697
- Just relax.
- No, I can't relax, okay?

19:58.781 --> 20:01.074
I cannot be around Sloan
and her together.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.243
She's gonna see it's written all over my
face, know what I'm saying?

20:03.327 --> 20:06.037
Yeah, I do.
You're a good Catholic boy.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.874
It's cute. So avoid temptation.
Go home.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.458
I'll tell them
you're sick.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.461
Coatroom.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.342
Eric. Hey,
where are you going?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.887
I was just gonna go outside.
I'm not feeling that well.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.223
- Oh no.
- I'm just feeling a little nauseous.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.058
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.352
You know, I think
I might need to go home.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.896
Yeah, of course.
Go to my place.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.815
I'll just finish up here and wait for
Tori's car to arrive,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.859
then I'll come back
and take care of you, okay?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.944
- Okay.
- I love you.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.571
I love you too.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.911
- See you.
- Feel better.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.580
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.000
It's time to announce
the winners of tonight's silent auction,

20:52.501 --> 20:55.462
the winner of the Dodgers
box seats,

20:55.546 --> 20:57.297
Peter Vapnick.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.507
Figures. The only thing
I actually wanted.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.676
- You don't deserve it!
- Congratulations, Peter.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.054
It's okay, Ari. I have something better
you can bid on.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.097
What, are you selling
your ass again, Davies?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.933
No, my client list.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.311
I know you're taking space.
I want in.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.813
You're crazy.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.945
I'd think that too if I didn't see you
dive under that car to avoid me today.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.280
But I did.
It made me curious.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.824
So much so that I pulled
a U-ey and went snooping.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.285
And guess what I found.

21:27.370 --> 21:31.623
Office space that says unless your
wife's baby blanket biz went big time,

21:31.707 --> 21:35.335
you are about to open
the largest agency in town.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.128
I want partnership,
corner office

21:37.213 --> 21:39.547
and $1 million
guaranteed salary.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.347
You wouldn't get that even
if I did like you, Davies.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.809
And B: Even if I were taking space,
which I am not,

21:50.893 --> 21:52.978
you fucked me last year.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.438
Do you really think
we can work together?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.816
Come on, Ari.
We're all animals.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.985
We just go wherever
there's the most food.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.529
My fridge is bare, pal.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.573
Okay, should we see what
Terrance thinks about it?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.827
Winner of St. Barts
for $12,800

22:08.911 --> 22:10.745
is Ari Gold.

22:13.791 --> 22:17.502
Next up, a week of sun and fun
on the French Riviera.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.838
And the winner is
Ari Gold.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.633
Really spending
that money, eh, Ari?

22:23.718 --> 22:25.760
What else did you buy?

22:25.886 --> 22:29.931
- Oh, nice suit, Davies.
- Thank you, Terrance.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.307
...a date
with a movie star...

22:32.018 --> 22:34.185
the gorgeous
Vincent Chase...

22:34.645 --> 22:37.439
Molly Burns.
Molly Burns.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.442
Here she is.
Let her hear it.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.945
Come on up, Molly.
Vince, ladies and gentlemen.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.367
Vincent Chase.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.829
- Where the fuck is he?
- Where is he?

22:53.414 --> 22:54.873
Vincent Chase
to the podium.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.459
Hiding is my guess.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.919
Vincent Chase, please.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.921
Vincent Chase
to the podium.

23:02.006 --> 23:05.216
- I wonder what you sold for.
- I wonder who I sold to.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.304
He's here somewhere.
We're gonna find him.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.599
Wait!

23:12.683 --> 23:14.893
Shh!

23:23.569 --> 23:24.569
Hey.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.072
Hey, baby.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.325
How are you feeling?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.494
Good.
Who's here?

23:33.120 --> 23:36.164
Tori. She missed her flight.
She's gonna crash on the couch.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.707
Her car is coming
at 5:30.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.459
Oh.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.336
I'm gonna get ready for bed.
Go back to sleep.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.504
Okay.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.822
Oh, you're still here?

24:09.365 --> 24:10.782
Oh, sorry.
Did I wake you?

24:10.866 --> 24:13.785
No, just going to get
a drink 'cause I'm thirsty.

24:13.869 --> 24:14.994
Okay.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.331
- Listen, it was nice to meet you.
- You too.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.629
- What are you thinking, Eric?
- I don't know.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.464
Want to jump on the couch
for 20 minutes

24:26.549 --> 24:27.757
while Sloan's sleeping
in the other room?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.136
No.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.931
- Go back to bed.
- I can't sleep.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.015
Take an Ambien.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.272
Listen, am I crazy,
or do we both want this?

24:43.983 --> 24:44.983
Does it matter?

24:47.361 --> 24:49.154
You got a great girl
in there, Eric.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.655
She almost let you
have this.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.575
Don't fuck it up.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.747
- Bye.
- Bye.
