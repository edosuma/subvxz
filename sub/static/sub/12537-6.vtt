01:00.275 --> 01:01.449
So...

01:02.543 --> 01:04.173
so why did you call me?

01:09.265 --> 01:11.700
I knew you'd come.

01:11.968 --> 01:13.902
What about your handler?

01:16.106 --> 01:17.974
I don't have one.

01:21.579 --> 01:24.714
I'm not a cop.
They took my badge.

01:26.316 --> 01:28.250
Why didn't you tell me?

01:29.786 --> 01:31.954
I got results.
Isn't that what matters?

01:36.426 --> 01:38.828
What matters is
who you've been talking to.

01:40.731 --> 01:43.800
What matters is who's been
tracking my phone,

01:45.035 --> 01:47.203
who ran Charlie's money.

01:49.073 --> 01:52.209
You're not the only one with
an inside source, Jimmy.

01:57.181 --> 01:59.116
You're not in jail, are you?

02:41.128 --> 02:43.663
I was gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?

02:44.298 --> 02:47.300
I have English Breakfast,
Earl Grey.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.036
- Irish Breakfast.
- Irish Breakfast?

02:50.071 --> 02:53.840
Yeah. English is like...
good morning. Care to wake up?

02:53.874 --> 02:56.376
Irish is more... get the fuck
out of bed, lazy ass.

02:57.111 --> 03:03.983
Um... that sounds great but my mom is
dropping Evie off so I should probably...

03:04.584 --> 03:08.487
No. No. Absolutely.
You, you should go.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.022
You should definitely
be there for her.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.257
Yeah.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.995
Thank you.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.730
You got it.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.131
Okay.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.061
Max Laszlo.

03:51.063 --> 03:54.032
Detectives Wilson and Fleming.
Oakland PD.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.737
Some people use a worm for bait,
but, hey... each to his own.

03:59.372 --> 04:03.575
Ha. Are you here to give me a ticket
or may I be of some assistance?

04:04.811 --> 04:06.678
We're looking for Jackie Hays.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.615
- Who?
- Yeah, yeah. Where is she?

04:10.817 --> 04:12.418
What did she do?

04:12.452 --> 04:15.154
Her car was involved in
an accident last night.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.957
Is she okay?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.892
If we knew that,
would we be here?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.962
Well, when was the last time
anyone saw her?

04:23.297 --> 04:26.966
So you're concerned now, 'cause
a moment ago you didn't know who she was.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.668
Did anyone check the hospitals?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.971
- Should we?
- What if she's lying in a ditch somewhere?

04:31.005 --> 04:34.307
- She's not.
- Right, so you do know something.

04:34.909 --> 04:36.977
This isn't a joke,
you little prick.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.413
Somebody took a shot at her.

04:39.881 --> 04:42.883
As a recent parolee, we know
you'll want to cooperate.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.953
So we'll ask you one more time.

04:46.588 --> 04:49.356
No. I'm sorry,
I haven't seen her.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.061
If she turns up...

04:57.498 --> 04:58.899
Absolutely.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.967
Good luck finding her,
Detectives.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.172
I'll call it in to Hernandez.

05:05.206 --> 05:08.041
I'll call it in to Hernandez.
You practice doing paperwork.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.378
Come on, Fleming.
Typey typey.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.699
Hello?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.868
Someone took a shot at me
last night.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.071
Christ.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.207
Are you okay?

05:41.241 --> 05:43.409
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.479
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.682
Do you think it's connected to
Jimmy's mole?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.685
Hernandez.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.188
If she's the mole.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.191
Whoever it was, tried to burn you once,
why not come after you again?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.594
No. Jimmy's not behind this.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.963
How the fuck can you tell that?

06:08.534 --> 06:12.003
It doesn't make sense.
Think about the timing.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.338
<i>Think about what
we discovered yesterday.</i>

06:14.373 --> 06:18.276
- Michael Chen.
- You pulled his file.

06:18.310 --> 06:21.413
Maybe you raised a flag.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.849
Maybe someone doesn't want us
asking questions.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.852
I'm the one who pulled the file.
Why come after you?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.690
You think someone's been
watching us?

06:35.762 --> 06:36.996
Shit.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.666
What's that?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.769
Nothing.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.639
I want you to be really careful,
okay?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.710
Okay.

07:14.369 --> 07:16.704
You're talking to your source.
Hm?

07:18.740 --> 07:20.207
Yeah.

07:23.578 --> 07:25.345
Everything okay?

07:27.581 --> 07:29.949
What was Charlie doing with
marked bills?

07:31.385 --> 07:32.885
What?

07:32.919 --> 07:36.489
Yeah. I traced 'em back to
a Fed named Michael Chen.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.660
Chen was onto you
for money laundering.

07:40.694 --> 07:44.630
Well, that's news to me.
Honestly.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.433
I guess you can't trust
your source after all.

07:48.169 --> 07:51.805
I haven't been able to trust him
for a fucking long time.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.709
Why do you think
I've been relying on you?

07:58.813 --> 08:03.416
You know so much.
Where's my money?

08:03.451 --> 08:05.184
What money?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.489
Did someone steal from you?

08:11.691 --> 08:14.260
Your source didn't mention
that part, hm?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.528
How much?

08:17.797 --> 08:18.864
Jimmy?

08:19.466 --> 08:20.867
All of it.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.904
What? A million,
two million...?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.973
Oh, no, no.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.509
25.

08:31.145 --> 08:33.111
Why didn't you tell me?

08:33.147 --> 08:34.881
My business.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.683
Our business.

08:40.087 --> 08:44.023
Jimmy, we can't do this unless we
tell each other what's going on.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.895
Was Tony Aldon in on it?

08:49.430 --> 08:52.933
They killed Tony for his share
and then came after me.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.670
You wanna tell me anything else?

09:26.434 --> 09:29.069
Daddy! Daddy! Guess what.

09:29.103 --> 09:30.237
What?

09:30.772 --> 09:33.874
Do you know what the dog said
to the sandpaper?

09:33.909 --> 09:35.376
What did the dog say
to the sandpaper?

09:35.410 --> 09:37.044
- Rough rough.
- Rough-rough rough-rough!

09:37.079 --> 09:39.213
Come on, honey. Let Daddy be.

09:39.415 --> 09:41.382
Downstairs, please. Now.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.917
Cath, it's fine.

09:44.687 --> 09:47.855
You have a big day.
She can tell you jokes later.

09:48.490 --> 09:50.624
Why does Daddy have a big day?

09:51.393 --> 09:54.295
Because Daddy's starting
his new job today.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.097
What about Grandpa?

09:56.131 --> 10:00.234
He's still working with Grandpa but
now he's doing Uncle Charlie's job too.

10:00.269 --> 10:02.737
It's the most important job
in Grandpa's company.

10:02.771 --> 10:04.472
It's not that big a deal.

10:05.841 --> 10:08.177
It's a really super-duper
big deal.

10:09.479 --> 10:13.382
Daddy's gonna do an amazing job,
he's been working on this for a long time.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.185
Grandpa's putting a lot of faith
in Daddy.

10:16.219 --> 10:18.487
And he's gonna do an amazing job.

10:23.993 --> 10:25.894
Anyone drive by,
check the place out?

10:25.928 --> 10:27.562
<i>Had someone there all night.</i>

10:27.597 --> 10:30.432
- Anyone follow him home?
<i>- Yeah. 6:30.</i>

10:30.466 --> 10:33.234
- 6:30 this morning. You sure?
<i>- Yeah, boss.</i>

10:33.269 --> 10:34.702
All right.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.595
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.534
I'm sorry for the early call but no-one
was home last night. David Kelly.

11:08.569 --> 11:10.603
I live over on Maple.

11:10.638 --> 11:12.572
Tom Travis.
How can I help you?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.841
My car was broken into
a few weeks back.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.644
The police said these things
happen all the time.

11:17.679 --> 11:20.214
But I've got kids, you know? These
things... It's not acceptable, in my book.

11:20.248 --> 11:22.984
My wife and I want to keep
things safe for families

11:23.018 --> 11:26.620
so we thought we'd start a
neighborhood watch program.

11:26.655 --> 11:29.023
Sounds like a good idea. Yes.

11:29.057 --> 11:31.058
Have you got five minutes?
I'd love to get your input.

11:31.093 --> 11:32.760
Er... well, right now.

11:32.794 --> 11:35.329
I could come back later
but my son has Little League.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.765
It wouldn't look good
if the coach didn't show.

11:37.799 --> 11:39.600
Right. Um...

11:39.634 --> 11:42.169
You know what? Sure. Fine. Come on in.
I got some coffee going. You want some?

11:42.203 --> 11:44.872
- Please. Thank you so much.
- Come on in. Any time.

11:44.906 --> 11:47.141
- The kitchen's back this way.
- All right.

11:54.516 --> 11:56.584
You have a lovely house.

11:57.085 --> 11:58.619
Thank you.

12:17.106 --> 12:19.774
- Milk?
- Black's fine. Thanks.

12:23.712 --> 12:25.613
Black coffee.

12:25.648 --> 12:26.814
Thank you.

12:26.849 --> 12:30.418
- This your wife?
- Yeah, that's her.

12:31.821 --> 12:35.957
You think she could help?
We could use all the hands we can get.

12:36.059 --> 12:40.329
It's hard enough to get her to a
parent-teacher conference and I'm a teacher.

12:40.363 --> 12:42.664
Found it! It was in
with the clean clothes.

12:42.699 --> 12:44.633
Thought you were supposed to put
those away.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.468
You have your system,
I have mine.

12:46.936 --> 12:48.303
Oh. Hi.

12:48.338 --> 12:49.971
Sweetheart, Evie, this is...

12:50.006 --> 12:52.908
- David. - David. Sorry.
David, this is my daughter Evie.

12:53.242 --> 12:55.810
- Nice to meet you, Evie.
- You too.

12:56.111 --> 12:58.546
- You ready, Dad?
- Yes, ready to go.

12:59.948 --> 13:01.916
You have your mother's eyes.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.617
Thank you.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.886
- I should let you go.
- Mm.

13:05.921 --> 13:09.524
Tom, can I sign you up?
Neighborhood watch.

13:09.558 --> 13:11.859
The next coffee's on me.

13:11.893 --> 13:14.929
- All right. What the hell. Sure.
- Thank you.

13:14.963 --> 13:17.465
Come on, come on, come on.

13:18.334 --> 13:19.867
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

13:19.902 --> 13:22.703
- I'll leave a letter in your box.
- All right. That's fine.

13:23.705 --> 13:25.706
- Hello.
- Tommy.

13:27.142 --> 13:30.010
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

13:30.044 --> 13:34.982
- Evie? <i>- Yeah. She's fine. She's right</i>
<i>here. What's going on? What's wrong?</i>

13:35.016 --> 13:36.984
<i>- Grace?</i>
- Yeah.

13:37.018 --> 13:39.553
What is it?

13:40.388 --> 13:43.156
I need you to stay someplace
else for a few days.

13:43.191 --> 13:44.558
What?

13:44.592 --> 13:46.560
- Hey, Dad, can we go?
- Why?

13:46.594 --> 13:49.964
Hold on, sweetheart
Just give me a sec, okay?

13:49.999 --> 13:51.766
Gracie, what the hell's
going on?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.568
Can you just do it, please?

13:53.602 --> 13:54.869
Why?

13:55.938 --> 13:58.373
It's probably nothing.
I just...

13:58.407 --> 14:00.375
You brought your shit to our
doorstep, didn't you?

14:00.409 --> 14:02.510
- Tom.
<i>- Are we in danger?</i>

14:02.544 --> 14:05.980
- No. - Then why the fuck do
we have to leave the house?

14:06.015 --> 14:09.517
Look. I'm being cautious, that's all.
All right?

14:12.587 --> 14:15.022
What exactly do I need to be
worried about?

14:16.257 --> 14:18.592
- I can't.
- Goddamnit, Grace.

14:18.626 --> 14:23.095
Tommy, please, it's a few days.
To be safe. I gotta go.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.765
- Of course you do.
- Tommy, promise me.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.434
- Please.
- Bye.

14:30.538 --> 14:32.138
Fuck.

14:32.740 --> 14:33.940
Evie, honey.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.784
Hey, hey. Guys, guys, come on!

14:43.819 --> 14:46.554
Oh, buddy, buddy, it's over.
That's it. It's done.

14:46.588 --> 14:48.857
I've got to use these.
That's what the boss says.

14:48.891 --> 14:50.358
End of story. Come on.

14:50.393 --> 14:53.228
Alec spoke to you, right?
You already went through this.

14:53.263 --> 14:56.532
Oh, yeah. Him and his
fucking thousand-dollar suit.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.901
The rest of us don't got money
coming out our asses.

14:58.935 --> 15:01.737
- Come here.
- What...

15:01.772 --> 15:03.038
Come on, easy.

15:03.073 --> 15:05.007
Call your boss.

15:05.775 --> 15:10.712
Lloyd, Lloyd, why the fuck do I care
if he won't use our containers?

15:10.747 --> 15:12.748
That's Max's problem now.

15:12.782 --> 15:14.850
Dumb fucking prick.

15:19.955 --> 15:22.824
Oh, well, look at you, babyface.

15:22.859 --> 15:25.594
Doesn't your new office
have a desk?

15:25.629 --> 15:27.430
We should get someone on that.

15:27.464 --> 15:31.101
There's also the floor.
Plenty of space...

15:31.368 --> 15:33.770
What are you doing? Huh?

15:33.804 --> 15:35.605
Paper airplanes?

15:35.640 --> 15:38.308
I'm checking last year's
tax returns.

15:38.343 --> 15:40.177
Ooh. Sounds important.

15:40.211 --> 15:42.946
Charlie's business is showing
too much income.

15:42.981 --> 15:45.615
Thank fucking Christ
you're here to save us.

15:45.650 --> 15:49.018
What do you want me to say, Alec?
I didn't ask for this job.

15:49.053 --> 15:51.221
Get out of Dad's chair.

15:51.255 --> 15:54.624
Honestly, I had no idea
he had this much faith in me.

15:54.658 --> 15:56.193
Out of the chair.

15:57.562 --> 15:58.728
Okay.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.136
Look, I'm sure it's
no reflection on you.

16:14.679 --> 16:15.946
Hey! Hey!

16:15.980 --> 16:17.681
Guys, come on.

16:23.288 --> 16:25.089
Come on. Leave the guy alone.

16:41.006 --> 16:42.740
That's enough!

16:42.774 --> 16:45.175
That's enough! That's enough!

16:45.209 --> 16:47.110
Get the fuck off me.

16:47.145 --> 16:48.745
- Get off me!
- Calm down.

16:48.780 --> 16:52.249
Get off! Get back to work!

16:52.850 --> 16:55.686
Get off! Get off me!

16:56.688 --> 16:59.123
You need help, Alec.

16:59.524 --> 17:01.626
You need help.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.995
Let's go.

17:04.029 --> 17:05.864
What the fuck
are you looking at, huh?

17:20.612 --> 17:25.148
Actually, Sarah,
I'm grateful I got caught.

17:26.685 --> 17:29.387
Lieutenant Hernandez
probably saved my life.

17:29.421 --> 17:33.824
'Cause if I'd stayed under in
the Laszlo Organization...

17:38.262 --> 17:43.434
In our first meeting you suggested
it was a bit of a rush,

17:43.468 --> 17:46.604
having no authorization,
no backup.

17:48.907 --> 17:51.275
You must have worked with
dozens of UCs.

17:51.309 --> 17:55.179
Isn't there a little adrenaline
junkie in all of us?

17:55.647 --> 17:59.050
I guess I just wanted to feel
something else.

18:01.453 --> 18:03.988
Something other than...

18:04.022 --> 18:05.156
Yeah.

18:08.794 --> 18:13.331
It's easier to focus on the rush
than the loss.

18:14.466 --> 18:18.103
And now that there is
no distraction?

18:19.806 --> 18:21.007
It's...

18:23.276 --> 18:25.477
It's living hell.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.751
Thank god for Tom and Evie.

18:32.353 --> 18:34.054
'Cause without them...

18:37.057 --> 18:39.325
Does that answer your question?

18:42.597 --> 18:46.600
I'll send my findings to the
committee, hopefully by next week.

18:47.869 --> 18:51.104
Then they'll take a view on
your probation.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:17.164 --> 19:20.099
- Come on in.
- You got new security?

19:20.133 --> 19:22.801
Yeah. You told me to be careful,
didn't you?

19:25.271 --> 19:27.172
Yeah, but...

19:29.875 --> 19:32.977
God, Mitch, I'm sorry
for dragging you into this.

19:33.012 --> 19:35.847
Ah, don't be. I'm not.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.551
What happened to your eye?

19:39.585 --> 19:42.454
No. It's not Hernandez.

19:43.389 --> 19:46.825
The mole.
We're looking for a man.

19:47.894 --> 19:49.661
Since when?

19:49.962 --> 19:52.097
Since this morning.
I just found out.

19:52.765 --> 19:55.233
From Jimmy?

19:56.369 --> 19:59.070
- He didn't just say it.
- Really?

19:59.772 --> 20:02.940
So when did he just not say it?

20:05.177 --> 20:08.713
My car was shot to shit
and the police were coming.

20:08.747 --> 20:10.181
Who else was I gonna call?

20:10.216 --> 20:12.451
Jesus, Grace,
you could've called me.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.388
You're already deep enough
in my crap.

20:16.422 --> 20:18.891
Exactly. So what's
a little more. Huh?

20:19.526 --> 20:21.527
Anyway, come here.
Look at this.

20:22.229 --> 20:24.096
Ballistics on Michael Chen.

20:29.135 --> 20:31.770
- Chen's bullet was home-made.
- Just like the others.

20:31.804 --> 20:34.506
- So he was murdered.
- Maybe.

20:34.540 --> 20:37.443
And we might actually get
an answer for once. Look.

20:39.212 --> 20:42.047
- Is this what I think it is?
- I'm running it.

20:42.415 --> 20:46.752
As soon as I get the rest of the stuff from the
Feds on Chen, we might get a full picture.

20:46.786 --> 20:50.122
You're a fucking genius.

20:50.156 --> 20:51.957
I like to think so.

21:03.103 --> 21:05.905
You look good in that chair.

21:09.844 --> 21:12.345
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened?

21:12.380 --> 21:14.247
- I'm fine.
- Did Alec do that?

21:14.282 --> 21:16.683
- It's nothing.
- Let me look at you.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.455
You know what he's like. He doesn't
know what he's doing half the time.

21:20.489 --> 21:23.458
- Don't you fucking defend him.
- It was a misunderstanding, okay?

21:23.492 --> 21:26.962
- You want me to talk to him?
- No. I can look after myself.

21:26.996 --> 21:29.632
Anyway, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

21:29.666 --> 21:32.969
- You heard about Jacks?
- Lloyd said the cops came by.

21:33.004 --> 21:36.239
- Yeah. Have you seen her? Is she
all right? - You know as much as I do.

21:36.274 --> 21:38.942
- If she's in trouble...
- What the fuck you gonna do?

21:38.977 --> 21:41.611
You can't even sort your shit out
with your own fucking brother.

21:41.646 --> 21:44.114
- I need you to focus on the business.
- I am.

21:44.148 --> 21:47.651
I put a lot of faith in you.
Don't make me regret it.

21:48.085 --> 21:49.486
You won't.

21:55.093 --> 21:57.394
What is it, Dad?

21:57.428 --> 21:59.162
Something's going on.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.935
It's fucking Charlie, that's what.

22:04.970 --> 22:06.337
Why?

22:06.371 --> 22:09.240
It looks like the bastard was
taking money from a bent Fed.

22:09.675 --> 22:12.676
- They were in it with Tony?
- Fucked if I know.

22:13.511 --> 22:15.446
Look through Charlie's files,
all of them.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.881
See if anything ever came up,
anything at all.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.351
What's this guy's name,
this Fed?

22:20.385 --> 22:22.420
Michael Chen.

22:22.454 --> 22:25.156
- And put some ice on this.
- It's fine.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.792
And sort your shit out
with your brother.

22:56.822 --> 23:01.359
When I think "out to pasture",
I always picture green hills,

23:01.394 --> 23:03.361
cows chewing the cud,

23:03.396 --> 23:04.796
you...

23:06.599 --> 23:08.533
Where is she, Mitch?

23:08.568 --> 23:10.102
Who's that?

23:11.204 --> 23:13.005
I was her fucking handler.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.807
I got the flags.

23:17.678 --> 23:24.184
Don't tell me that out of pretty Mr. Blue Sky you
suddenly developed an interest in the Laszlos.

23:24.219 --> 23:26.387
Where is she, Mitch?

23:26.421 --> 23:29.824
Sorry, you said something
about a flag.

23:29.858 --> 23:31.759
She's got to be getting
her intel from somewhere.

23:33.728 --> 23:37.164
She could be getting it on her
own, she was well trained.

23:37.199 --> 23:41.034
Fucking pathetic. Glory days
spent training other people.

23:41.069 --> 23:42.869
Blow me.

23:43.504 --> 23:45.204
Another day.

23:47.541 --> 23:50.543
If you don't tell me
where she is, Mitch...

23:50.578 --> 23:52.345
You'll what?

23:55.682 --> 23:58.218
I just want to know she's okay.

24:02.924 --> 24:06.060
Her car was bent like a tin can.
Did you know that?

24:07.362 --> 24:11.264
If someone's trying to kill her
I need to know who and why.

24:12.433 --> 24:14.501
You're the guy to help.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.037
Why the fuck not?

24:18.506 --> 24:21.040
Is it so ridiculous I might
actually give a shit?

24:22.376 --> 24:25.344
If I hear from her I'll let her
know you came by. How's that?

24:25.379 --> 24:27.313
Great. You do that.

24:27.347 --> 24:28.747
Yeah.

24:42.061 --> 24:43.495
- Hey.
- Max.

24:43.763 --> 24:44.996
You okay?

24:45.865 --> 24:47.432
You're asking me?
What happened to you?

24:47.466 --> 24:49.701
Nothing. It's nothing.

24:49.735 --> 24:51.703
The cops came by
looking for you.

24:51.737 --> 24:53.805
Sounds like you pissed someone
off about a car accident.

24:55.007 --> 24:56.374
Is that what they said?

24:56.409 --> 25:00.212
Actually they said
there were shots fired.

25:00.246 --> 25:02.414
- Who was it?
- Honestly?

25:02.448 --> 25:06.085
- Don't lie to me.
- I have no idea.

25:08.622 --> 25:11.824
Well... I'm here for you.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.960
Just saying that.

25:15.362 --> 25:18.297
Rough day for you, too?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.868
- You don't have to tell me.
- Oh, it's...

25:25.072 --> 25:27.640
It's my dearest brother.

25:29.910 --> 25:32.945
I'm worried about him,
Jacks, actually.

25:32.979 --> 25:35.781
I think he's losing it.
First this thing with the heads. Now this.

25:37.817 --> 25:40.319
I'm sorry. You know what,
it's not your problem.

25:40.353 --> 25:42.421
- Never mind.
- No. Max, come on.

25:42.456 --> 25:44.490
I'm just glad you're okay.

25:46.793 --> 25:48.627
You wanna go for a drink later?

25:48.661 --> 25:50.829
I just think we could
both use one.

25:52.699 --> 25:54.900
Let's see what the day brings.

26:06.445 --> 26:08.447
Hm? Cover your tracks?

26:09.382 --> 26:12.750
The cops know I'm too smart
to come back here.

26:12.785 --> 26:14.685
You know the Fed
I told you about?

26:14.720 --> 26:16.120
Yeah. What about him?

26:16.155 --> 26:20.124
Supposedly, a few months back
he committed suicide.

26:20.158 --> 26:22.726
The bullet in his head
was home-made.

26:22.761 --> 26:24.528
Okay.

26:24.563 --> 26:26.831
This time, the casing had
a stamp on it.

26:26.865 --> 26:29.133
- Traceable?
- Barely, but yeah.

26:29.167 --> 26:33.504
Manufacturer sold a batch to a
shooting range outside Livermore.

26:33.538 --> 26:35.873
- You up for a drive?
- Sure.

27:07.606 --> 27:09.741
Is this a joke?

27:09.775 --> 27:11.809
Your genius
can get us an address

27:11.843 --> 27:14.245
but doesn't think to make
a fuckin' phone call?

27:14.279 --> 27:17.381
Whoever made our bullets
got the casings here.

27:28.692 --> 27:30.693
Takes a lot of work
to get lost out here.

27:30.727 --> 27:34.664
When did this place shut
down? I used to shoot here.

27:34.698 --> 27:37.734
And now you're trespassing.
Get back in your car.

27:39.203 --> 27:40.737
270 Winchester.

27:40.772 --> 27:42.406
You're a genius.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.575
Is it still usable?

27:44.609 --> 27:46.377
Ten seconds I start shooting.

27:46.411 --> 27:48.046
You didn't answer my question.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.315
I'm an excellent shot.

27:50.349 --> 27:52.484
Someone's making bullets
out of these.

27:52.518 --> 27:54.185
Five seconds.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.020
And we have business
for that someone.

27:56.055 --> 27:58.189
- Time's up.
- We got it.

27:58.223 --> 28:01.225
You don't want our money,
we'll spend it elsewhere.

28:01.260 --> 28:04.661
500 to start. Plus double
my hourly for details.

28:04.696 --> 28:06.197
Your hourly? Jesus.

28:06.231 --> 28:08.665
You think I watch this dump
for free?

28:08.700 --> 28:11.234
How can we be sure you know
who we're looking for?

28:12.237 --> 28:14.405
You can't.

28:20.278 --> 28:24.182
He's a skinny guy. White.
Trashy as they come.

28:24.216 --> 28:27.385
Collects shell casings. Throws
me cash to look the other way.

28:27.420 --> 28:30.822
- How often is he here?
- I'd consider that a detail.

28:32.525 --> 28:34.893
I make ten an hour.
I assume you can do the math.

28:40.701 --> 28:42.435
He doesn't have a schedule.

28:42.469 --> 28:45.638
Sometimes shows up every week.
Sometimes not for months.

28:45.672 --> 28:47.840
You got a way
to get a hold of him?

28:53.414 --> 28:55.615
- No.
- This is fuckin' ridiculous.

28:55.650 --> 28:59.586
So's making ten an hour after serving
your country for five years.

29:04.458 --> 29:07.893
He lives in the hills. Generator,
chicken coops. That type.

29:07.928 --> 29:09.361
Got an address?

29:28.212 --> 29:32.658
_

30:40.586 --> 30:43.187
- Hey!
- Don't!

30:43.222 --> 30:46.223
Shut the fuckin' dogs up.

30:53.431 --> 30:57.134
All right.
Who do you supply to?

30:58.202 --> 31:00.304
Jonah. Huh?

31:01.372 --> 31:03.573
I don't consider patience
a virtue.

31:03.608 --> 31:07.210
Neither did Esau.
And thus we have Israel.

31:07.245 --> 31:10.247
A fuckin' Bible lesson?
You make bullets.

31:10.281 --> 31:12.282
As is my Constitutional right.

31:12.316 --> 31:14.785
Who buys them? Hm?

31:15.553 --> 31:17.921
- Who buys them?
- Give us a name, Jonah.

31:17.955 --> 31:20.457
A well regulated militia,
being necessary...

31:20.492 --> 31:22.559
..free state...

31:23.662 --> 31:25.162
Name!

31:25.196 --> 31:28.966
The right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be...

31:29.000 --> 31:30.934
It's all downhill from here.

31:30.969 --> 31:34.805
They're mine! All right? I make 'em
so that when that day comes...

31:34.839 --> 31:36.607
Hmm?
The fuckin' day has come.

31:36.641 --> 31:38.742
I only sold 'em once!

31:38.777 --> 31:41.745
I sold 'em once.
I never got the guy's name.

31:42.914 --> 31:44.682
I never got his name.

31:45.784 --> 31:47.818
Is this him?

31:48.520 --> 31:51.122
- That is him.
- Fuckin' Charlie, huh?

31:51.156 --> 31:54.291
Did you kill Charlie? Did you
fuckin' kill Charlie? Is that you?

31:54.326 --> 31:57.395
- I didn't kill Charlie.
- Who was he working for?

31:57.429 --> 31:58.996
Fuck!

31:59.031 --> 32:01.833
Who was he working for?

32:01.867 --> 32:03.468
Fuck!

32:06.004 --> 32:08.773
- You fuckin' killed Charlie!
- I didn't kill Charlie!

32:08.807 --> 32:11.776
You killed Charlie!

32:12.411 --> 32:15.213
- Who the fuck was he working for?
- I don't know!

32:15.247 --> 32:18.049
Who the fuck
was he working for?

32:19.051 --> 32:22.754
- You fuckin' killed Charlie!
- I didn't kill Charlie!

32:22.789 --> 32:25.057
Ever see someone
with their cheek blown out?

32:26.325 --> 32:29.328
No. No, he doesn't
know anything, Jimmy!

32:29.362 --> 32:31.596
- I didn't kill him!
- Jimmy!

32:31.631 --> 32:34.199
No! He doesn't know anything!
Jimmy, listen to me!

32:34.233 --> 32:37.702
Both cheeks?
You'll have fuckin' flaps.

32:37.736 --> 32:42.373
Jimmy, stop it! He's another fucking dead end.
Come on. Let's go!

32:45.878 --> 32:47.712
Let's go.

33:06.533 --> 33:08.834
We're going round in circles.
Jesus.

33:08.868 --> 33:11.837
We get to Charlie
and then this Jonah.

33:11.871 --> 33:14.707
And now we're back
to fuckin' Charlie.

33:14.741 --> 33:17.476
- We'll find something.
- Huh? Maybe.

33:17.511 --> 33:20.179
Maybe you got more faith
than I do.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.217
- Hm?
- We need to clear our heads.

33:24.251 --> 33:26.552
And get some sleep.

33:28.455 --> 33:30.857
- I should check in at home.
- Yeah.

33:31.925 --> 33:34.227
Will I see you
back at the hotel?

33:34.261 --> 33:35.861
Hm?

33:35.896 --> 33:37.864
I'll call you.

34:05.894 --> 34:07.929
Mitch, it's me.

34:07.964 --> 34:12.065
I need you to run a name.
Jonah Mann.

34:12.101 --> 34:14.469
See if he was ever
in Santa Rita Jail.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.174
Does Mom know we're here?

34:19.208 --> 34:22.444
Your grandmother's got her church group over.
You rather stay there instead?

34:22.478 --> 34:25.981
- When can we go home?
- Depends on the exterminators, sweetheart.

34:26.014 --> 34:27.949
What? So we suddenly
have termites?

34:27.984 --> 34:29.752
Shh.

34:34.657 --> 34:36.024
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:36.059 --> 34:38.994
Apparently, we have termites.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.967
Thank you for letting us stay.

35:03.921 --> 35:05.921
_

35:11.862 --> 35:15.098
- Hey.
- What took you so long?

35:15.133 --> 35:19.268
Gee, thanks, Mitch, for
dropping your son off early,

35:19.303 --> 35:22.004
coming all the way down here
to meet me, get me in.

35:22.039 --> 35:23.640
That, too.

35:23.674 --> 35:25.975
- You know I appreciate it.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:26.010 --> 35:29.045
- I'm telling you, these two
knew each other. - We'll see.

35:31.882 --> 35:34.384
Need to scan your ID's, please.

35:42.293 --> 35:45.195
- This... this can't be right.
- What?

35:45.229 --> 35:49.332
According to this, our guys weren't in the
same housing unit, let alone the same cell.

35:51.502 --> 35:53.136
Can you double check
the system?

35:53.170 --> 35:56.139
- If it's in the file...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

35:56.173 --> 35:58.775
All right.
We'll keep looking.

35:59.610 --> 36:02.512
Housing units 2 and 33.
How close are they?

36:02.547 --> 36:04.414
California and Egypt.

36:04.449 --> 36:08.051
And you're positive that if you bothered
to check that you would discover...

36:08.086 --> 36:10.921
Hey. My boss said yes
to this. Not me.

36:10.956 --> 36:12.723
I'd be happy
to give him a call.

36:12.757 --> 36:15.625
No, no. That's okay.
That's okay.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.995
Mind checking if those
visitor logs are here yet?

36:18.029 --> 36:19.963
Thanks.

36:21.332 --> 36:24.033
- Travis...
- What is wrong with you?

36:24.068 --> 36:27.804
Max said that his friend drove
40 miles for Fat Lucy's. Right?

36:27.839 --> 36:31.675
Jonah Mann, who lives 40 miles away,
had a trash can full of that shit.

36:31.710 --> 36:35.513
Don't say it's a coincidence, Mitch. They
were in here together. They know each other.

36:35.547 --> 36:38.449
I actually was gonna tell you to just
dial it back a little bit

36:38.483 --> 36:41.051
before the prick kicks us out of
here and we got nothing. All right?

36:44.656 --> 36:47.358
What about their work details?

36:48.393 --> 36:52.029
Max was in the kitchen.
And Jonah... laundry.

36:54.165 --> 36:56.133
The kitchen and laundry.
Where are they?

36:56.167 --> 36:58.835
Services would be
in the Service building.

37:00.638 --> 37:03.973
- How many men working out there?
- I don't know. Couple of hundred.

37:04.008 --> 37:07.510
That puts them in proximity.
You have their rec schedules?

37:07.544 --> 37:09.779
No, proximity's all we need.

37:09.813 --> 37:11.814
They're both white.

37:11.848 --> 37:13.449
So?

37:13.483 --> 37:16.986
Nortenos, triads, blacks.
It's self-segregation.

37:17.020 --> 37:19.822
If they were in a gang,
their files would be red.

37:19.856 --> 37:24.226
Thank you. You don't have to be Aryan
Brotherhood to want to stick together.

37:24.261 --> 37:27.062
Not if you look like these two.

37:29.299 --> 37:31.934
So are those
the visitors' logs?

37:35.339 --> 37:37.006
Thanks.

37:43.346 --> 37:46.382
Motherfucker. Check this out.

37:47.384 --> 37:52.121
Tony Aldon visited Max,
April 21st, April 28th.

37:52.155 --> 37:54.656
What the fuck was Tony Aldon
doing visiting Max?

37:54.691 --> 37:58.126
And when was Michael Chen
killed? April 24th.

37:58.161 --> 38:01.297
So Chen shows up dead three days
after Tony Aldon's first visit?

38:01.331 --> 38:02.698
Yeah.

38:02.732 --> 38:05.734
- When did Tony die?
- September 7th.

38:07.303 --> 38:09.739
September. September...

38:11.241 --> 38:13.409
September.

38:14.544 --> 38:16.546
Oh, fuck.

38:16.580 --> 38:19.415
Tony visited Max again
on September 6th.

38:19.449 --> 38:21.551
The day before he was shot.

38:22.319 --> 38:24.553
All roads lead to Max.

38:25.322 --> 38:28.190
It's Jimmy's own kid. Christ.

38:51.845 --> 38:55.413
Hey, it's me.
Something came up tonight.

38:55.447 --> 38:57.047
Something you should
be aware of.

38:57.082 --> 38:59.783
Take a look.
I'm sending it right over.

39:24.172 --> 39:26.140
Hi.

39:28.643 --> 39:30.611
I'm so glad you're here.

39:30.645 --> 39:33.247
It has been quite a day.

39:33.281 --> 39:35.449
- You want a drink?
- Yeah.

39:37.384 --> 39:40.320
- What can I get for you?
- Whiskey neat. Thanks.

39:44.124 --> 39:46.859
Wow. We make
quite a pair, huh?

39:46.893 --> 39:48.927
Yeah.

39:51.129 --> 39:53.264
Why would anyone shoot at you?

39:53.298 --> 39:56.500
Well, they didn't stick around
long enough for me to ask.

39:58.703 --> 40:01.472
Come on, Jacks.
You're talking to me.

40:03.141 --> 40:05.543
Someone tried to take you out.

40:06.778 --> 40:08.345
Who'd want you dead?

40:09.747 --> 40:12.416
Same people
who want Jimmy dead.

40:12.450 --> 40:16.053
You got something they want?
You know something you shouldn't?

40:16.087 --> 40:19.623
What is it? Come on.
What secrets are you hiding, Jackie?

40:22.794 --> 40:25.062
Thank you.

40:28.332 --> 40:30.500
I'm sorry.

40:30.535 --> 40:34.004
I wouldn't ask you all these
questions. It's just...

40:34.038 --> 40:37.040
I'm... worried about Dad.

40:38.843 --> 40:42.345
You know, he seems preoccupied.
He just takes off.

40:43.347 --> 40:45.514
The crew are jumpy.

40:45.549 --> 40:48.383
They rely on him.

40:50.887 --> 40:53.088
I understand. I get it.

40:54.157 --> 40:58.728
Sometimes it's easier talking to
someone who's not so involved.

41:00.897 --> 41:03.399
I envy him. He's got you.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.672
Something's going on.

41:10.175 --> 41:12.777
Tell me.
Just between the two of us.

41:12.811 --> 41:15.646
Please. He's my dad. I want
to make sure he's okay.

41:20.018 --> 41:21.985
Believe me,

41:22.020 --> 41:24.621
if there was something
you needed to know,

41:25.623 --> 41:27.858
I would tell you.

41:30.093 --> 41:32.928
I just can't believe
your own brother did that.

41:34.564 --> 41:37.099
It's gotta be tough.

41:37.133 --> 41:39.702
Alec, the heir apparent...

41:41.204 --> 41:43.973
inheriting Jimmy's
operation. Come on.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.076
You wanna know the truth?

41:51.381 --> 41:55.084
- I feel sorry for Alec.
- What?

41:55.118 --> 41:56.752
I always have.

41:59.122 --> 42:01.123
When I was a kid...

42:02.125 --> 42:06.328
I was playing hide-and-seek
with this friend from across the street.

42:06.363 --> 42:08.464
And...

42:08.498 --> 42:11.067
I was hiding in the front yard.

42:11.101 --> 42:13.603
And this man
comes up to the house.

42:14.705 --> 42:17.306
He's shaking. He's terrified.

42:18.408 --> 42:20.943
He owed my dad money.

42:22.245 --> 42:24.714
He couldn't pay it.

42:24.748 --> 42:29.552
My dad opens the door and this guy,
he's stood there. He's... shaking.

42:31.688 --> 42:33.689
Cos he's got nothing.

42:34.691 --> 42:37.226
He thinks my dad
is gonna kill him.

42:41.364 --> 42:46.401
So he offered up his wife...

42:48.038 --> 42:50.808
He offered his wife
to pay the debt.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.613
And my dad...

42:57.250 --> 42:59.418
he looks at him...

43:00.820 --> 43:03.022
and he smiles...

43:04.525 --> 43:06.660
and he says, "No."

43:10.432 --> 43:12.867
That power my dad had...

43:16.037 --> 43:18.105
it fascinated me.

43:21.209 --> 43:23.377
And it scared me.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.181
Honestly,

43:28.215 --> 43:31.151
I don't know what I'd do
with that kind of power.

43:45.297 --> 43:46.498
Sorry.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.370
Yeah. I'm with someone.

43:52.404 --> 43:55.573
The untraceable number
that Charlie sent his last text to.

43:55.607 --> 43:58.275
The last empty text?
It just received this.

44:06.617 --> 44:09.319
- Yeah.
<i>- You there?</i>

44:09.353 --> 44:12.122
Yeah. That's...
that's interesting.

44:12.156 --> 44:15.225
<i>Yeah. It was sent from
right outside the prison.</i>

44:15.259 --> 44:17.494
<i>Probably that fuckin' guard.</i>

44:19.764 --> 44:22.833
Well, why don't you
do me a favor and...

44:24.436 --> 44:25.970
return the greeting?

44:26.004 --> 44:27.771
What's that gonna prove?

44:27.805 --> 44:30.540
It might even alert them
to the fact that we're...

44:31.809 --> 44:35.011
Christ.
Who are you with right now?

44:35.046 --> 44:37.981
Just... just do it for me,
will you?

44:38.015 --> 44:40.050
<i>I'm sending it now.</i>

44:46.392 --> 44:48.426
You're not gonna walk out
on me again?

44:48.461 --> 44:50.395
Oh, I hope not.

44:59.148 --> 45:01.288
_

45:07.512 --> 45:09.513
You know...

45:10.815 --> 45:14.117
you can tell a lot about
someone from their hands.

45:14.935 --> 45:16.565
Yeah.

45:22.561 --> 45:24.562
Maybe...

45:25.831 --> 45:27.799
we should go somewhere else.

45:27.834 --> 45:29.935
Get some dinner.

45:36.543 --> 45:40.146
Well, why don't I just go
freshen up in the bathroom?

46:16.918 --> 46:18.118
Jackie.

46:20.521 --> 46:22.155
What?

46:24.325 --> 46:25.859
What's wrong?

46:31.966 --> 46:34.267
Why are you running, Jackie?
