00:02.220 --> 00:07.970
Listen,mom,I know I promised,but it's the only
time the realtor can show me through the office.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.660
Sarah,it's an office.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.160
The only thing you need to
knowis does it have a window?

00:12.220 --> 00:17.610
Just because greenatopia's doing well,I can't take the risk
that kyle and ethan aren't gonna suddenly turn into donald trump.

00:18.110 --> 00:21.090
I promise that I will
come and meet ryan.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.370
- Like when?
- Mom,I have to go.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.550
Oh,goD.I'm so sorry.I
forgot to call you back.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.820
To confirm,I hope.

00:26.890 --> 00:28.900
Yeah,you know what?Something,um,something
came up at the office.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.730
What could be so important you can't
find the time to meet your half brother?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.900
Can you,uh,hang on for a sec?

00:34.520 --> 00:36.470
It's my mom.You can
talk to her.She's nice.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.960
hey,mom. I,uh,I-I can't talk right now.

00:42.030 --> 00:43.950
Fine.Then just listen.

00:44.090 --> 00:47.960
I made a reservation for 1:00 at
that new little bistro on colorado.

00:48.030 --> 00:49.430
I wish I
could.I-I-I can'T.

00:49.530 --> 00:51.400
No,tommY.Don't you dare cancel on me.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.540
Mom,look,holly just put together a
last-minute meeting I cannot cancel.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.530
Push it.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.230
I definitely can't push it.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.280
All right,um,I gotta go,mom. Bye.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.940
all rise.

01:03.010 --> 01:06.090

honorable arthur gray presiding.

calling the case of  people vs.Thomas
walker.Docket number 3-7-5-6-4.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.710
you know what?Screw tommy.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.510
You think he would've remembered
what it was like when dad embezzled.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.810
I mean,he practically took the
business to his grave with him.

01:28.890 --> 01:30.870
You know,it wouldn't have been
the worst thing if you'd gone.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.050
Becca,how-- how can you even
say that?I mean,he lied to you.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.870
- He made you think buying that land was your idea.
- Yeah.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.890
I'm sorry,but you couldn't pay
me to go to his arraignment.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.850
someone's calling.

01:43.990 --> 01:46.680
Oh,great.It's my mom,again.I'm
so not answering that.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.210
well,she probably wants to talk
about everythingthat's going on.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.750
She actually doesn't
even know what's going on.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.040
We're supposed to wait
for tommy to tell her.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.410
She just wants me to hang out with ryan.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.020
And that was enough.The last
thing I need is another sibling.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.000
And I'm sure you said the same thing
about me,but look where that got us.

02:02.070 --> 02:06.890
If you think that I'm going to be dating ryan
in a year,that's just really weird and gross.

02:08.889 --> 02:12.920
I know you say that I shouldn't blame myself
for this,but it's not ryan's fault,either.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.480
Yeah,you're right.It's
tommy and your mom'S.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.870
My mom didn't do anything.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.550
Rebecca,you know what I mean.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.260
No,what do you mean?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.940
nothing,all right?You know
what?Let's not fight about this.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.240
The last thing I need is you
on a red-eye to new york again.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.670
My leaving had nothing
to do with my mother.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.110
Except for the fact that she stormed
in here and blamed me for everything.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.890
okay,you know what?You're right.We
shouldn't talk about this.Let's just not.

02:33.950 --> 02:36.210
Let's do that,all right?Let's just
promise that we're not gonna talk about it.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.640
We love each other too much
to take sides,all right?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.350
- You're right.
- Promise?Let's stay out of it?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.570
- **********?
- Okay,I promise.No more talk about it.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.430
Promise?No more?

02:44.960 --> 02:46.320
Okay.Oh,I so don't want to go to work.

02:46.430 --> 02:47.390
Why?I mean,tommy's not gonna be there.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.050
So?Still,it's-

02:49.130 --> 02:53.520
- rebecca,we're not talk--
you're right.I'm sorry.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.590
Bye. Bye,baby.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.810
And give ryan a break.

02:58.950 --> 03:01.530
Fine.But I'm not hanging out with him.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.300
no,no,no,no,ryan.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.670
You don't have to do that.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.830
Oh,it's okay.Really.I
mean,you are putting me up.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.530
I'm glad to.Get-- let me
finish that.Don't worry.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.710
So what time are we meeting everybody?

03:18.390 --> 03:21.170
Actually,it looks like it's
just you and me for lunch.

03:21.250 --> 03:26.350
It seems that kevin and tommy and sarah are all
stuck in meetings,and I can't get ahold of justin.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.820
I can never get hold of justin.

03:27.930 --> 03:28.970
It's okay.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.470
You know,I--I'm not sure
I'd want to meet me,either.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.370
I am their dad's
illegitimate child,so--

03:33.410 --> 03:36.230
no,nothing-- nothing
about you is illegitimate.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.100
They're just busy,that's all.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.810
Yeah,well,I feel like I just
kinda... came outta nowhere,you know?

03:41.870 --> 03:44.540
Well,I asked you to come,anytime.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.560
I'm so glad you're here.

03:46.620 --> 03:49.920
I-I just don't want it to seem like
I'm being presumptuous,like I think...

03:51.390 --> 03:54.970
I can just show up here and
kind of... belong or anything.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.030
Ryan,william turned their
life upside down,too.

03:59.090 --> 04:00.590
That's why I want you to meet them.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.410
They're living proof
you can get through this.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.720
You know what?

04:03.770 --> 04:05.570
We should go to ojai after lunch.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.370
You could see the family business.Tommy
will be out of his meetings by then.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.140
I'm sure he'd love to show
you around.What do you think?

04:12.090 --> 04:13.190
Okay.

04:14.290 --> 04:16.380
Okay.Great.

04:17.230 --> 04:21.750
Very well,mr. Walker's posted bail.We'll
see you all back on march 25th.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.640
Thank you,your honor.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.170
Is that good?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.260
- as well as can
be-- are we done?

04:26.310 --> 04:27.980
yeah.

04:32.820 --> 04:34.780
she's off-limits,tommy.Not a word.

04:37.590 --> 04:40.370
Gotta give her credit
for burying the smile.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.070
Oh,wait till she gets
to the parking garage.

04:42.150 --> 04:44.180
She'll break out into song.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.300
Hey,julia.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.820
Did he do this?

04:49.900 --> 04:52.490
you know what?You really need
to talk to him about this.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.150
Right.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.400
and you'll get me those bank
statements as soon as you can?

05:00.510 --> 05:01.550
Yes,of course.

05:01.650 --> 05:03.690
Okay.We'll talk more this afternoon.

05:03.810 --> 05:05.710
Hey,go home and get some rest.All right.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.530
Thanks.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.430
oh,finally.

05:11.510 --> 05:16.290
I have never seen more stupid
bureaucracy in my entire life.

05:16.430 --> 05:18.750
That's what you have to say?

05:19.660 --> 05:21.390
You did this.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.340
Um,can we not do this here?

05:23.430 --> 05:25.200
That's why all the promises,right?

05:25.260 --> 05:28.040
- The new car,redoing the backyard-- were you
just trying to distract me... - of course not.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.730
So I wouldn't suspect anything?

05:29.850 --> 05:32.260
- Babe--no!- What if
you go tjail,then what?

05:32.330 --> 05:33.560
Did you even think about us?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.370
- Can we do this at home?
- No,we cannot.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.470
- I don't want you
there.- Julia--julia.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.100
No,you're on your own,tommy.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.070
Do not come home.

<i>"Taking Sides"</i>

05:52.950 --> 05:54.620
I think we should go to holly.

05:54.660 --> 05:55.940
After all,she's human.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.920
Well,that's disputable.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.370
Anyway,it's not up to her.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.020
It's with the D.A. Now,right?

06:00.160 --> 06:03.380
Well,we're not talking enron here.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.140
Ojai's not a public company.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.330
There's a chance--if
somehow holly agreed to it--

06:08.430 --> 06:12.910
we could go to the D.A.,Tell them tommy made
restitution and that we worked it out privately.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.180
The D.A. Might let it go.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.010
It'd save the state a
ton of time and money.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.120
Great.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.160
- I'll go see her.
- No,I don't think that's a good plan.

06:19.270 --> 06:20.070
Well,you can't go.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.310
What do you mean,I can't
go?Of course I can go.

06:21.400 --> 06:26.190
I just tell holly that tommy changed his mind
and he wasn't gonna go ahead with his stupid plan.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.110
- After she asked you about it and you lied?
- Come on.

06:28.210 --> 06:29.280
Come on,honestly.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.170
I think I've got a better
chance of getting through to her.

06:31.250 --> 06:35.290
Both of you can stop,because neither of you will
talk to her without a lawyer present,you hear me?

06:35.380 --> 06:38.090
- You're a lawyer.
- Absotely not.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.500
- If tommy wanted our help,he'd be here.
- Come on,stay focused.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.810
Tommy has to work things out
with julia,so cut him some slack.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.610
You know what?I think we've
done all we can for today.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.470
I have to get back to the office.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.300
,Would you tell kitty what's going on?

06:48.380 --> 06:50.350
Sure,if you tell tommy
he has to talk to mom.

06:50.470 --> 06:51.700
Fine.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.690
Bye.Bye.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.600
- So now what?
- Justin.

06:55.690 --> 06:56.600
What do you mean?

06:56.720 --> 06:58.940
- He could talk to rebecca.
- so how's it goin'?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.490
- Ac,itally's going fine.
- That's great.

07:00.690 --> 07:02.560
Oh,hey.Do you have a
sec?I can't get online.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.360
Oh,yeah.J-- let
me call you back.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.000
Uh,yeah,sure.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.640
Um,actually,you know
what?I'll meet you in there.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.090
- I'm just--I'll finish up
relyuick.- Okay. Okay,thanks.

07:10.150 --> 07:12.440
Oh,my god.Oh,my god.You're
not gonna believe this.

07:12.550 --> 07:13.880
Nora just walked in with ryan.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.500
What?You gotta get her outta there.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.130
- I know.
- I mean,what if e bumps into your mom?

07:17.220 --> 07:18.150
She doesn't know about tommy.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.230
I know.Let me figure it out.

07:19.330 --> 07:20.750
I'll call you back.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.800
Rebecca.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.290
You remember ryan?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.850
Yeah,of course.Of course.

07:26.970 --> 07:28.420
Uh,what brings you guys by today?

07:28.470 --> 07:31.270
Oh,you didn't get the memo?It's--it's
"bring your illegitimate child to work" day.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.980
Oh,yeah.I went to that last year.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.250
cute,kids.Really cute.

07:35.330 --> 07:39.040
I-I was hoping that tommy would be out
of his meeting and he could give us aour.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.740
You know what?I think
he has meetings all day.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.660
Oh,no.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.880
Pretty soon,ryan is gonna think
I made up these kids of mine.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.750
oh,no.They exist.Trust me.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.820
Well,I know the place like the back
of my hand.I'll give you a tour.Okay.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.470
Oh,no.Why--why don't
i give you a tour?

07:54.530 --> 07:57.290
Um,we could start out by the loading
dock.We just got a shipment of pears.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.880
It's amazing.

07:59.150 --> 08:00.770
Wow,you must really like pears.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.400
Pears are good.I like pears.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.200
- What is this?
- Surprise.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.510
The kids did it.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.250
- They're here?
- No.No,robert.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.730
They're at the hotel.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.050
But I did tell them that I was gonna
call them as soon as you got home.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.630
Good.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.480
Yeah.

08:26.610 --> 08:28.250
You didn't tel'em?

08:28.790 --> 08:30.480
What,tell them that
you had a heart attack?

08:30.490 --> 08:36.039
No. No,but--but... robert,they're
gonna find out eventually.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.360
I really do think you have to tell them.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.020
Yeah.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.430
are you,uh... you okay?

08:47.140 --> 08:49.140
No,you--you seem like
you're in--in pain.

08:49.230 --> 08:51.130
No,no,I'm good.Go--
go be with the baby.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.860
All right,all right.But--but listen
to me,the doctor said no stress.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.640
you're not allowed.

09:01.330 --> 09:04.770
You know,if you want,we can--
we can,uh,tell the kids together.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.200
Yeah,no.I-I need to do it myself.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.780
Okay. Okay.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.560
So,um,I need...

09:15.140 --> 09:17.860
look,I know it's a stretch,I
just thought,coming from rebecca,

09:17.970 --> 09:20.650
there's a chancehat
holly might be convinced.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.890
I knew there was a reason
why you made me cookies.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.500
He's in serious trouble,justin.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.860
I know,sarah.That's exactly
why we're not getting involved.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.460
And I get that completely,but we're
talking about tommy going to jail.

09:31.890 --> 09:33.280
stupid.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
you know julia kicked him out?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.300
- She did?
- Yeah.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.370
Oh,no.

09:39.450 --> 09:41.940
And the thing is,he--
he was trying to undo it.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.130
He just--he
ran out of time.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.670
Sarah,he still stole money from
the company to buy that land.

09:45.730 --> 09:46.870
I'm not condoning his methods.

09:46.930 --> 09:50.570
I'm just saying that... he was there
for you when you were at your bottom.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.280
He wasn't there for me.He
didn't even speak to me.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.200
That was out of love.

09:54.270 --> 09:55.880
And right now,he needs ours.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.040
You don't understand.Rebecca and I
are on really rocky ground,all right?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.290
And this whole tommy
situation is not helping.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.480
This is family,justin.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.870
You can't pretend that
you're not involved.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.360
We're staying out of it.

10:12.450 --> 10:15.170
I thought you'd send kevin.

10:15.230 --> 10:18.300
- Maybe even
saul,but-- no,just me.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.040
May I come in?

10:20.100 --> 10:21.440
Sure.

10:25.220 --> 10:28.200
listen,holly,there is another
way that we could do this.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.420
- Sarah-- just
please hear me out.

10:34.690 --> 10:38.190
***

10:38.570 --> 10:40.700
*****

10:40.830 --> 10:45.250
Forfeit all his shares and his voting
rights... never set foot in the building again.

10:46.550 --> 10:50.020
And in exchange,the
prosecution would be dropped.

10:50.070 --> 10:51.550
Tommy would go scot-free.

10:51.670 --> 10:56.750
I wouldn't call it scot-free,but...
he would be spared jail,yeah.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.560
It's like d?

10:59.670 --> 11:03.670
Someone in your family screws up,and
you come to me asking for help.

11:04.510 --> 11:10.410
I'm asking you to consider that tommy has lost
everything that he spent his whole life building .

11:11.650 --> 11:13.300
and that he has a young family

11:13.400 --> 11:14.550
Whom he should've considered.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.610
Holly,you know that he wasn't
gonna go through with it.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.170
It's why he canceled the board meeting.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.260
The board meeting where he
was going to have me fired.

11:21.290 --> 11:22.590
No,he changed his mind.

11:22.630 --> 11:24.530
Of course he did,once he was caught.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.670
God,what is wrong with you?!

11:26.760 --> 11:27.690
You've won,holly.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.930
You got what you wanted.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.860
- All of this is yours
- it's amazing.

11:31.950 --> 11:39.860
I hold up my end of the bargain,I behave honorably,and
still,you and your family think that this  my doing.

11:39.940 --> 11:42.130
I'm not here to argue with you,holly.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.140
What tommy did was wrong.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.120
I'm not gonna dispute that.

11:47.370 --> 11:52.720
But if you really loved my father,you would know that
he wouldn't want to see one of his children destroyed

11:52.840 --> 11:55.830
because of this company,because
of something that he built.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.690
That may be.

11:57.790 --> 12:02.330
But this has nothing to do
with your father anymore.

12:03.060 --> 12:06.310
Tommy did this to himself.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.690
well,that's pretty much it.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.350
The rest is just offices
and then more offices.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.130
And,uh,well,yeah.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.460
I hope i didn't bore you to death.

12:23.530 --> 12:26.530
No way.I had no idea
so much went into fruit.

12:26.610 --> 12:29.400
Now you're just lying.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.460
rebecca,why don't you
come over fodinner,tonight?

12:31.530 --> 12:33.070
- Tonight?
- You know what?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.930
I'll invite everyone.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.310
You know,uh,I don't really
think,um,that it's a good idea.

12:38.380 --> 12:39.650
- Why not?
- Well,no,just for me.

12:39.730 --> 12:40.960
I just have a lot of work to do.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.000
We'll make it a late
dinner.Say 8:00 or 8:30.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.420
Nora,you really don't have to do
that.I'm totally fine on my own.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.230
Really.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.810
I'M... I'M...
m-- okay,yeah.

12:51.890 --> 12:53.510
Uh,8:30,I guess,could work.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.990
Great.So we'll just go and
get out of your hair now.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.570
bye,honey.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.530
- Bye.
- Hey,thanks for showing me around.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.570
Yeah,see you later.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.670
saul,you have to get them here.

13:09.770 --> 13:12.530
Tell them they have no
choice in the matter.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.630
Because they listen to you.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.000
Look,I gotta go.Okay.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.720
So I have good news.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.170
Everyone is coming to dinner tonight.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.550
- Everyone?
- Yeah.

13:26.690 --> 13:28.190
What'd you do,threaten them?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.530
no.

13:29.670 --> 13:33.500
Well,kitty has to stay with robert and
the baby,but you'll meet them soon enough.

13:33.590 --> 13:34.970
That's totally okay.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.190
I'm nervous enough as it is.

13:36.300 --> 13:40.420
You'll be fine.Believe me,with this group,you
won't be able to get a word in edgewise.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.990
- So don't be nervous.
- Oh,I'm okay.

13:42.070 --> 13:47.900
I just,uh... rebecca told me about her first dinner
here,and she was just saying that everyone sat around

13:48.000 --> 13:50.950
and quietly stared at
her the entire time.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.440
Okay,so we'll do a buffet.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.580
That's much better,much,much better.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.340
It's easy,it's loose.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.370
It'll be great.

14:00.770 --> 14:01.940
Well,can I help you cook?

14:02.010 --> 14:04.360
No,no,no.I've got it all under control.

14:04.430 --> 14:06.330
I'm a pretty good cook.

14:06.770 --> 14:07.720
Really?

14:07.820 --> 14:09.670
Yeah.

14:09.860 --> 14:11.400
Julia left him?

14:11.490 --> 14:14.270
Yeah,she kicked him
out.He's crashing at sarah'S.

14:14.330 --> 14:15.910
What about elizabeth?

14:15.990 --> 14:17.760
I don't know.

14:18.130 --> 14:23.370
You know,like,I... I want to
help him and... you're right.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.260
We're not talking about this.

14:25.530 --> 14:29.080
You know,I need to give these to my mom.I
guess I'll just drop them off before dinner.

14:30.510 --> 14:31.480
Wait,you're going over there now?

14:31.580 --> 14:34.660
I'll meet you at your mom'S.Don't
worry.I'm not trying to get out of it.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.560
Maybe you could,uh... I don't know.

14:39.660 --> 14:42.080
You know,may-maybe
you could talk to her.

14:43.390 --> 14:44.710
- Justin-- no,I
know,rebecca.I know.

14:44.820 --> 14:47.590
- I'm sorry to even a-- I don't--I
don't even know what I would say.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.090
I mean,she's hurt and she's angry.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.070
Look,I understand all that,and
I'm not telling her to forgive him.

14:51.140 --> 14:57.220
I... just may-maybe you can get her to...
like,reconsider pressing charges,you know?

14:57.300 --> 14:58.700
I mean,he--he's
my brother.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.130
That would be forgiving him,justin.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.790
You're right.You're right.I'm sorry.I
sh--I shouldn't have brought it up.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.180
No,it's fine.I-I understand.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.230
I mean,I know that you
want to help him.I just--

15:09.330 --> 15:11.070
- I don't know what-- let's
just-- let's just drop it.

15:14.930 --> 15:16.160
Is tommy gonna be at the dinner?

15:16.230 --> 15:17.940
I don't know if I can do that.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.740
Rebecca,look,I will not let
anything bad happen to you,okay?

15:21.820 --> 15:23.490
********

15:23.570 --> 15:27.040
I mean,he's not
gon  jus-I don't--

15:27.130 --> 15:30.230
you have nothing to worry
about in this whole situation.

15:30.490 --> 15:33.940
You... you're--
you're switzerland.

15:34.010 --> 15:37.870
You're beautiful and... neutral.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.800
Okay? Come here.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.230
- I'll see you at dinner,okay?
- Yeah.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.720
He's due back in court in ten days.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.160
Oh,and sarah's appointed herself leader
of the "free tommy walker" campaign.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.660
Oh,what does that entail?

15:53.700 --> 15:55.470
So far just bed and board.How's robert?

15:55.610 --> 15:56.710
I don't know.You know,it's hard to tell.

15:56.790 --> 16:00.800
He's not very forthcoming,kind of like
your press releases about his condition.

16:00.890 --> 16:01.970
Have you told him about tommy?

16:02.120 --> 16:05.120
God,no.Kevin,are you crazy?

16:05.230 --> 16:10.080
I mean,he's stressed out enough as it is without going
ballistic over the political implications of that.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.410
You know,kit,I tried to talk him out
of going through with this campaign.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.000
That would require him to
acknowledge that his life has changed.

16:17.030 --> 16:20.060
And you know what?He's
not,not even to his own kids.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.110
that sounds like tommy.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.710
He won't even admit he might have to
go to prison,he thinks he's invincible.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.770
No,he thinks he's dad.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.540
at least you get out
of this ryan soiree.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.060
Oh,you know,honestly?

16:30.210 --> 16:33.730
I think it would come as a
welcome relief at this point.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.080
You know what,kevin?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.120
Courtney's here with the kids.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.680
I-I better get back.Will
you,uh,tell tommy that I love him?

16:40.730 --> 16:44.630
Okay,tell robert I... l-like him a lot.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.770
well done.

16:50.790 --> 16:52.480
yes!

16:55.380 --> 16:57.630
He fell asleep as soon as he ate.

16:58.870 --> 17:03.490
Oh,death,taxes and robert's inability to
show weakness-- some things never change.

17:04.890 --> 17:09.190
Well,I-I think that he'S...
putting on a good face for the kids.

17:09.230 --> 17:11.550
Right,but you'd think he just
had his wisdom teeth pulled.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.260
Okay.Okay,you try,dad.

17:18.220 --> 17:19.589
Uh,no,no,no,no,no.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.569
I-I think that you should
just be the referee.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.440
- Please,can daddy play?
- Why don't you just let daddy watch?

17:23.540 --> 17:25.970
I'm not gonna break.Look
at the two of you...

17:26.069 --> 17:28.640
boy,that's why I never
understood polygamy.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.250
Okay,here we go.Ready?

17:34.950 --> 17:35.940
All right.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.280
Yes! Nice!

17:37.370 --> 17:38.750
That's how you knock 'em down.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.200
Low five,low five.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.320
You know,honey--
what?

17:42.420 --> 17:45.330
I-I think it would be a good idea if
you took a break,maybe took a little--

17:45.390 --> 17:47.780
I don't need to be put down for a nap.

17:49.770 --> 17:50.660
I'm sorry.

17:50.730 --> 17:51.540
Oh,no,sweetie.

17:51.580 --> 17:54.540
No,you--you,uh,you
didn't do anything wrong.

17:55.590 --> 17:59.160
No,you know what?She's
right.I should go lay down.

17:59.310 --> 18:02.180
But listen,I want you
guys to practice,okay?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.890
Because when I come back,it is so on.

18:05.070 --> 18:06.700
Okay?

18:13.950 --> 18:16.260
You know what,guys?Maybe
we should get going,huh?

18:21.610 --> 18:24.190
Okay.I took some
notes,drew up a timeline.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.840
Okay.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.440
Okay,that's great.I'll see you then.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.620
uh,sorry.Just my lawyer.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.340
So I gathered.

18:33.410 --> 18:37.280
David,there are a few things I
need to take care of for this case.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.410
Like going to the arraignment?

18:40.790 --> 18:46.480
Okay,I know I said that I
wouldn't go,but ojai is my company.

18:46.530 --> 18:48.840
- I needed to be there
to-- what,to gloat?

18:48.900 --> 18:50.860
I don't want this drama.

18:50.950 --> 18:53.280
I-I don't want any of this.

18:55.790 --> 18:57.840
rebecca.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.970
Uh... I brought you these.

19:02.030 --> 19:04.390
Oh,thanks.You didn't need to do that.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.960
No problem.

19:07.030 --> 19:08.000
Am I interrupting something?

19:08.070 --> 19:09.370
No,you're not interrupting anything.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.980
No,your,uh,your mom was just telling me how
much she's not enjoying this business with tommy.

19:14.040 --> 19:18.270
I know it's hard for you to
believe,but this has been hard for me.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.790
I know.It's very painful.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.620
Stop.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.930
- You know,tommy's actually really suffering.
- I know.I'm sorry.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.680
And there's nothing
I can do to change it.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.990
You could drop the charges.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.940
What?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.930
Mom,I know what he did was unforgivable.

19:36.980 --> 19:42.820
But if tommy goes to jail... mom,I love
you,but justin and i love each other,too,

19:42.900 --> 19:46.090
and it's coming between us
even though we're trying.

19:47.410 --> 19:50.140
you're the only person that can stop it.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.330
She's right,holly.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.260
I'm not asking you to do it for tommy.

19:54.470 --> 19:57.540
But if there's any way
that you can do it for me...

19:59.220 --> 20:00.950
I'll think about it.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.960
I will.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.120
I stopped in at ojai.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.300
That's a joke,right?

20:16.610 --> 20:21.230
It must be,because I know you heard me this morning
when I specifically said that would be a terrible idea.

20:21.290 --> 20:25.180
I'm sorry if I'm a little concerned that-- that the
only time I might be able to see my brother for the next,

20:25.260 --> 20:28.690
I don't know,five years,is
through a sheet of glass.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.990
- We can't let it happen,kevin.
- I know,I know.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.080
It doesn't mean we can stop it.

20:34.190 --> 20:35.630
Do we even know if he's coming tonight?

20:35.680 --> 20:40.320
Yes,he agreed to come,and after
we leave,he's gonna tell mom.

20:40.830 --> 20:41.920
Good.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.470
- How do I look?
- What?

20:45.550 --> 20:47.990
Is this too fancy,with the bow?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.000
I don't care.

20:50.050 --> 20:55.290
You'd think I would know what to wear to one of
these "meet your new half sibling" shindigs by now.

20:49.820 --> 20:52.400
You'd think I would know what to wear to one of these

20:52.400 --> 20:56.340
"meet your new half sibling" shindigs by now.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.000
all right,let me guess.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.090
Mm,preemptively intoxicating yourself before the worst-timed dinner in walker family history?

21:02.090 --> 21:04.960
I thought hiding in the corner might help,too.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.360
So thank you for the strong-arm phone call.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.630
Please.I'm merely the messenger.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.010
That was all nora's work.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.860
has tommy even told her?

21:12.860 --> 21:15.940
Or is he just gonna wait until she notices a prison postmark on his first letter?

21:15.940 --> 21:19.890
Well,I suspect he's having a bit of denial,if that's what you're asking.

21:19.890 --> 21:21.330
Well,this is gonna be fun.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.960
Where are harold and maude?Thank you.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.670
Maude's in the kitchen.Harold's upstairs.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.250
All right.Don't,uh,don't worry about it.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.860
We haven't even,uh,started eating yet,so...

21:28.860 --> 21:31.100
 all right.Sweet.I'll,uh,I'll talk to you later.

21:31.100 --> 21:31.850
All right.Bye.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.070
who was that?

21:33.070 --> 21:35.170
Oh,that was rebecca.

21:35.710 --> 21:36.820
what,is there a problem?

21:36.820 --> 21:37.720
Oh,no,justin.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.720
Hey,I should invite joe.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.180
Because apparently there is no limit to the amount of tension

21:42.180 --> 21:43.310
that this family can bear.

21:43.310 --> 21:44.700
Sarah,you know what?It's not her problem.

21:44.700 --> 21:45.580
It's tommy's problem,all right?

21:45.580 --> 21:46.760
So let him deal with it.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.540
Deal with what?

21:49.540 --> 21:50.950
Justin invited rebecca.

21:50.950 --> 21:52.120
Actually,mom did,okay?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.570
And she has every right to be here.

21:53.570 --> 21:54.600
This is unbelievable.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.880
Wow,man.Well,I really apprecia the support.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.890
You know what,dude?Don'T.

21:57.890 --> 21:59.350
Maybe you're the one that shouldn't be here,all right?

21:59.350 --> 22:00.420
-Oh,really?Know what?
-hey,hey,guys.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.660
Now is not the time to talk about this,so keep your voice down.

22:02.660 --> 22:06.120
Listen,everybody-- 

22:06.120 --> 22:07.840
all right,you guys.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.540
I know what you're doing.

22:10.540 --> 22:15.080
Dling... 

22:15.890 --> 22:17.790
-mom,um... 
-he's just upstairs.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.350
He's gonna come down any minute.

22:19.350 --> 22:20.420
Mom,we're not even talking about ryan.

22:20.420 --> 22:21.900
-We're talking about... 
-you okay?

22:21.900 --> 22:22.660
Yeah,it's spicy.It's good.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.160
Sure you're not talking about ryan,and I'm the queen of sheba.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.020
Actually,you are.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.540
Please,please,please,just be nice tight.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.810
Just be yourselves.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.730
be nice or be ourselves--which is it?

22:31.730 --> 22:33.280
good point,kevin.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.690
So you see?They do exist.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.200
Kevin.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.000
-Hi,kevin.
-Really nice to meet you.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.600
Nice to see you again,man.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.410
I'm tommy.Scotty and sarah.sarah walker.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.170
I told them to be themselves.

22:50.170 --> 22:52.670
Who the hell are these people?

22:57.280 --> 23:00.730
So,uh,how's berkeley working out for you?

23:00.730 --> 23:01.750
It's good.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.720
You know,I actually really wanted to go there.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.420
Mom talked me out of it.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.530
That's funny.She said it was kinda of the opposite.

23:08.530 --> 23:09.790
That's ridiculous.

23:09.790 --> 23:13.100
Oh,my--you gotta watch her.She's very good at rewriting history.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.930
I guess history gets rewritten a lot around here,doesn't it?

23:16.930 --> 23:19.560
*********?

23:31.020 --> 23:32.510
hey,babe.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.190
You made it.

23:34.190 --> 23:36.630
I need to talk to you when you get a second,okay?

23:36.630 --> 23:37.670
Sure.

23:37.670 --> 23:38.540
Everything all right?

23:38.540 --> 23:39.880
Hey,long time,no see.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.000
Hey,thanks again for the tour.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.860
Uh... what--what tour?

23:44.860 --> 23:46.860
Oh,rebecca showed me around ojai today.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.050
Really?So you guys went to,uh,ojai?

23:50.050 --> 23:51.510
Yeah,nora took me over there.

23:51.510 --> 23:54.480
It's a really impressive operation you guys got going on.

23:55.030 --> 23:59.370
Your mother must be so proud,rebecca.

24:04.370 --> 24:07.510
I'm gonna set my stuff down.

24:07.890 --> 24:09.090
-Tommy.
-What?

24:09.090 --> 24:10.150
Not now.

24:10.150 --> 24:13.560
actually,guys,go ahead.I'm gonna get a refill.

24:16.630 --> 24:18.780
I'm sorry.I have a problem with the way he's been acting tonight.

24:18.780 --> 24:20.580
Aren't we all acting on account of ryan?

24:20.580 --> 24:21.640
Isn't that the mandate?

24:21.640 --> 24:23.850
Tommy was arrested for felony embezzlement.

24:23.850 --> 24:25.770
You think a little humility might be in order.

24:25.770 --> 24:27.220
Stop taking it so personally.

24:27.220 --> 24:30.590
Besides,the night is almost over.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.640
Thank god.

24:37.550 --> 24:38.940
oh,yeah.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.800
You're a little fussy,huh?

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
Well,how do you feel?

24:45.440 --> 24:46.980
You hungry?You want some soup?

24:46.980 --> 24:49.820
No.Where-- where are the kids?

24:49.820 --> 24:54.440
Well,you know,they're on east coast time,so courtney took 'em back to the hotel.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.850
Courtney and those damn schedules.

24:55.850 --> 24:58.730
Actually,that's not why they left.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.830
What do you mean?

24:59.830 --> 25:02.550
What happened to telling the kids?

25:02.550 --> 25:03.700
I told you.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.410
-I'm gonna tell 'em.
-When?

25:06.410 --> 25:09.160
I'm sorry.I know that you've been through a lot.

25:09.160 --> 25:13.060
And I-I don't want to upset you,but this is not okay.

25:13.060 --> 25:16.210
You've got to stop shutting everybody out like this.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.290
I'm doing the best I can do.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.100
Robert,your kids are not stupid.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.700
They sense that something is wrong,and by not telling the truth,

25:21.700 --> 25:23.820
it makes it even scarier for them.

25:23.820 --> 25:25.900
And you think the truth is less scary?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.070
that I almost died?

25:27.070 --> 25:28.770
Are you kidding me?

25:28.770 --> 25:30.860
Kids don't want to hear that about their father.

25:30.860 --> 25:33.220
Well,maybe they don't want to know it,but they need to know who their father is.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.450
They need to know what he's thinking and what he feels.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.670
I'll tell you how I feel.

25:36.670 --> 25:38.360
I'm exhausted.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.580
I can barely keep my eyes open.

25:39.580 --> 25:43.350
I have pain everywhere-- in my chest,in my legs,in my I.V. Sites.

25:43.350 --> 25:46.190
When I walk across the room,it feels like my heart's about to jump out of my chest.

25:46.190 --> 25:48.670
Is that what you want me to tell jack and sophie?

25:48.670 --> 25:53.870
I want you to stop pretending that everything is fine when it isn'T.

25:53.870 --> 25:57.230
I mean,if you want to act that way towards me?Fine.

25:57.230 --> 26:04.480
But sophie and jack deserve more and... and so does evan.

26:15.460 --> 26:17.670
What are you doing sitting in here all by yourself?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.540
You're the guest of honor.

26:19.540 --> 26:20.590
it's okay,really.

26:20.590 --> 26:21.930
No,it's not okay.

26:21.930 --> 26:23.340
I wish you could hear them talking.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.050
They're saying the nicest things about you.

26:25.050 --> 26:28.290
Thank you,but you don't need to cover anymore.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.290
I mean,I know why you didn't want me to know,but... 

26:30.290 --> 26:31.970
know what?

26:31.970 --> 26:33.610
About tommy getting arrested.

26:33.610 --> 26:36.590
I--it's--it's-- it's good,though.I was getting really paranoid.

26:36.590 --> 26:39.650
Everyone was starting to act weird around me,and then...

26:39.650 --> 26:41.130
what are you talking about?

26:41.130 --> 26:44.910
It's okay.I know he embezzled money... 

26:45.500 --> 26:49.110
oh,god.Why do I get the feeling I just screwed up?

26:49.110 --> 26:52.380
It's okay. 

26:52.750 --> 26:55.380
It's okay. 

26:55.970 --> 26:57.930
It's okay.

27:00.150 --> 27:03.070
where's tommy?

27:07.340 --> 27:10.180
When were you gonna tell me?

27:10.180 --> 27:11.910
nora,don't do this now.Ryan doesn't have to-- 

27:11.910 --> 27:15.440
ryan is the only one with the decency to let me know.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.430
Are--are you kidding me?

27:16.430 --> 27:18.040
Why would you say something to her?

27:18.040 --> 27:19.790
-I didn't know.
-Oh,stop it.

27:19.790 --> 27:21.810
This has nothing to do with him.

27:21.810 --> 27:24.220
Who--who did youembezzle from?

27:24.220 --> 27:26.310
You know what?Now really  isn't the time for this.

27:26.310 --> 27:27.140
Kevin's right.This is much more-- 

27:27.140 --> 27:29.790
I'm talking to tommy.Who did you embezzle from?

27:29.790 --> 27:31.380
Look,mom,it's complicated,all right?

27:31.380 --> 27:36.820
I needed money to fund a deal,so I-I borrowed it froojai.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.810
From ojai?

27:37.810 --> 27:40.640
Yeah,and I will put it back.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.880
Just like your father was.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.050
oh,I see.

27:47.050 --> 27:51.180
See,I'm just doing what you're all scared to do,and that's get holly out.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.510
You can't blame my mother for this.

27:52.510 --> 27:53.680
-Rebecca-- 
-oh,please.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.550
It's not enough that--that she destroys my parents' marriage?

27:56.550 --> 27:58.150
Now she's gotta take ojai as well?

27:58.150 --> 27:59.170
She didn't do anything wrong.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.520
She had her eye on ojai before she even met us.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.670
Everybody knows it.

28:02.670 --> 28:04.260
It's not a secret,recca.

28:04.260 --> 28:05.290
Tommy,not in front of her.

28:05.290 --> 28:06.580
I don't care about holly.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.040
What are you doing,tommy?

28:08.040 --> 28:09.150
What are you doing?

28:09.150 --> 28:11.050
You have a child.You have a wife.

28:11.050 --> 28:13.590
How could you have such little regard for them,for us?

28:13.590 --> 28:16.580
For god sakes,that's why I'm doing this,mom--

28:16.580 --> 28:19.380
for our family,for us,for our kids.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.650
She is trying to take everything dad ever built.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.810
-I'm so sick of you blaming her for everything.
-Rebecca,stop getting involved.

28:23.810 --> 28:24.970
No,no,no.My mother trusted you.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.970
She built walker landing with you,she stepped in to help ojai,and what?

28:27.970 --> 28:29.220
-What?You lie to her,you use me.
-Please.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.310
Look,rebecca,spare us,all right?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.670
We all know whose side you're on.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.520
Yeah,which is exactly why I want you to shut up.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.440
No,you shut up.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.490
Look,my dad worked his butt off building this company.

28:39.490 --> 28:41.240
I'm doing exactly what he would've done.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.740
Your father?Your father.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.630
What your father did was unforgivable.

28:44.630 --> 28:47.900
I despise him for it.

28:47.900 --> 28:52.450
Really?Well,you sure loved living off of it,mom.

28:57.140 --> 29:00.030
Feel better?

29:01.460 --> 29:06.730
Sometimes I wonder if this family is even worth saving.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.570
I'm sorry,ryan.

29:23.570 --> 29:28.010
I thought meeting my children would be helpful to you.

29:28.550 --> 29:32.120
clearly,I was wrong.

29:56.650 --> 29:58.160
you okay?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.500
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.060
I just--I wish I didn't come tonight.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.860
Yeah,but we're just...  it was really cool what you did in there,standing up to them.

30:09.860 --> 30:12.790
It took a lot of courage.

30:12.790 --> 30:17.330
I wish justin had some.He just stood there.

30:17.330 --> 30:21.890
He'S... probably just not good under pressure.

30:23.290 --> 30:26.950
I really thought that we could get through this.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.690
I just don't know.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.280
I'm sorry.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.560
last thing you want to hear about are my problems.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.660
I'm really sorry that you had to witness all of that.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.420
Are you kidding me?

30:41.420 --> 30:44.700
You really took the spotlight off of me and my big mouth.

30:44.700 --> 30:48.820
if it wasn't for you,I'd be fish food for the entire walker clan.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.780
They're not always like that.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.470
Really?

30:52.470 --> 30:57.730
Well,and here I thought they were this perfect,produce-loving family.

30:58.810 --> 31:01.380
turns out my brother's a real jerk,huh?

31:01.380 --> 31:03.510
Which one?

31:03.510 --> 31:06.430
I was talking about tommy.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.760
are you sure you're okay?

31:14.040 --> 31:16.570
I don't know.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.360
I know it's te.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.830
It's okay.It's okay,nora.

31:33.830 --> 31:36.940
I was gonna call you tomorrow anyway.

31:36.940 --> 31:39.140
Sarah told me everything.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.230
-I see.
-You knew.

31:41.230 --> 31:45.230
-Yes,I knew. 
-How long?

31:45.970 --> 31:48.170
Uh... a few months,probably.

31:48.170 --> 31:49.060
A few months?

31:49.060 --> 31:52.760
Nora,please understand that I told tommy that I was against this from the beginning.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.300
You knew tommy was determined to break the law,

31:55.300 --> 31:58.010
and all you did was advise him against it?

31:58.010 --> 31:58.740
Just a second,nora.

31:58.740 --> 32:02.120
I warned him about this adamantly from the very beginning.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.560
Tell me,what else was I supposed to do? 

32:03.560 --> 32:06.880
Tell me. Tell me.

32:06.880 --> 32:10.510
The minute you knew he was thinking of heading down that path,you should've told me.

32:10.510 --> 32:12.690
I should've told you?

32:12.690 --> 32:14.570
I didn't think it was my place to involve you.

32:14.570 --> 32:18.810
He's my son. He's my son,damn it.

32:20.650 --> 32:22.460
oh,I know why he came to you.

32:22.460 --> 32:23.940
The same reason william did--

32:23.940 --> 32:26.760
because you're comfortable dealing in lies,saul.

32:26.760 --> 32:30.030
You always have been.

32:30.650 --> 32:31.710
Tell me something.

32:31.710 --> 32:34.110
What are you comfortable with,nora,hmm?

32:34.110 --> 32:35.380
Truth?

32:35.380 --> 32:37.250
I don't think so.

32:37.250 --> 32:41.010
If you wanted to know the truth about william,all you had to do was open your eyes.

32:41.010 --> 32:42.800
But you didn't want to.

32:42.800 --> 32:47.050
You made it very clear that you were better off not knowing the messy parts.

32:47.050 --> 32:51.350
so I didn't tell you all these things about tommy because you didn't tant meo,sister.

32:51.350 --> 32:55.500
I know.That's true.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.750
but it's not true now.

33:02.750 --> 33:05.700
I've changed.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.850
I don't need you to protect me anymore.

33:07.850 --> 33:09.960
I don't want you to.

33:09.960 --> 33:15.520
I want all the uncomfortable truth,all the awful secrets out in the open.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.490
That's why I invited ryan here.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.630
Because if I had anything to do with his suffering,

33:19.630 --> 33:23.180
then I want to take responsibility for it.

33:23.180 --> 33:26.410
My eyes are open,saul.

33:26.410 --> 33:29.890
From now on,my eyes are open.

33:34.710 --> 33:42.280
You've asked me to see all the ways you've grown and changed over the last year.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.120
Right now,all I can see are the ways you haven'T.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.690
and there's the bell  for round two.

33:57.690 --> 34:02.060
And it's crueshoff right back  in there holding terrell...

34:02.060 --> 34:03.420
I was looking for you all over the place.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.150
Your mom said you left.

34:05.150 --> 34:09.449
Well,you seemed pretty cght up talking with ryan.

34:11.030 --> 34:15.510
you're not actually gonna make this about ryan.

34:16.650 --> 34:19.070
Justin,you hung me out to dry in front of your entire family.

34:19.070 --> 34:20.699
Because we said we weren't gonna get involved.

34:20.699 --> 34:23.429
Oh,like this morning when you asked me to get involved 

34:23.429 --> 34:26.730
-I suppose that was different?
-It was a mistake.

34:27.110 --> 34:28.920
Justin,you said that you would be there for me tonight

34:28.920 --> 34:31.360
if I went with you,and you weren'T.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.770
-What did you want me to do?
-I wanted you to defend me.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.659
Or at least t tell me to shut up and just stand there

34:36.659 --> 34:39.139
while kevin acted like I was some witness for the prosecution.

34:39.139 --> 34:41.300
You know,I'm sorry.I didn't know it was gonna go down like that,rebecca.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.120
I didn't know that your loyalty was contingent on the circumstances.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.270
Tommy might go to jail,okay?

34:46.270 --> 34:48.889
I'm sorry if my family's a little harsh on you.

34:48.889 --> 34:50.620
A little harsh?

34:50.620 --> 34:51.900
Talk about taking sides.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.469
Don't!Don't act like you're above it.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.000
You took your mom's side the entire time.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.010
Someone has to!

34:58.990 --> 35:00.870
-You don't get it.
-No,I don't get it.

35:00.870 --> 35:03.440
No,you don'T.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.520
And no matter what,it's always gonna be the same.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.860
You will always choose them.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.170
And that's fine.

35:12.170 --> 35:15.960
But I need to make a choice,too.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.150
So I'm choosing my family.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.270
-What does that mean?
-It's not gonna work.

35:21.270 --> 35:24.300
It never was.

35:24.900 --> 35:26.630
Seriously?

35:26.630 --> 35:28.810
Awesome.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.990
I was wrong.

35:35.990 --> 35:39.260
I should never have asked you to go easy on tommy.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.450
Do whatever you need to do.

36:02.780 --> 36:07.240
I can't remember the last time someone in this house got up before me.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.070
I was--I was having trouble sleeping.

36:09.070 --> 36:10.160
I made some coffee.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.110
It's a little strong,though.

36:11.110 --> 36:13.590
Sounds perfect.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.680
about last night,I wouldn't have said anything

36:18.680 --> 36:21.440
if-- if I thought you didn't know.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.260
I don't know what to say...

36:24.260 --> 36:28.450
except I wouldn't blame you if you got the next flight outta here.

36:28.740 --> 36:32.800
Actually,I was kinda hoping I could stick around for a little bit.

36:32.800 --> 36:38.370
You know,they're not perfect,but that's actually a little bit of a relief,you know,that they're...

36:39.850 --> 36:42.050
screwed up?

36:42.050 --> 36:43.620
you can say it.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.800
Screwed up.

36:47.770 --> 36:54.130
You know,the funny thing is... now I feel like I can actually fit in.

36:58.030 --> 37:02.350
Who knows?Maybe we-- we can help each other.

37:04.780 --> 37:06.070
your charm bracelet?

37:06.070 --> 37:07.430
I can'T.It's your favorite.

37:07.430 --> 37:08.470
but it's also  my good luck charm.

37:08.470 --> 37:11.300
I mean,if you wear this,todd will for sure  ask you to the dance.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.410
There you guys are. 

37:13.410 --> 37:15.210
sorry.We were just hanging out.

37:15.210 --> 37:16.840
Oh,no.It's--it's okay.

37:16.840 --> 37:23.570
I'm just... coming to see you and maybe talk to you guys.

37:23.570 --> 37:26.710
You know,I,um... I never really got to explain

37:26.710 --> 37:30.060
what happened to me inhe hospital.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.540
Mom told us you were sick.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.390
Yeah,yeah,but what happened was that I had a heart attack.

37:35.390 --> 37:37.770
But I'm fine now.

37:37.770 --> 37:40.700
But chandler wilson's dad had a art attack,and he--

37:40.700 --> 37:43.310
honey,I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

37:43.310 --> 37:44.700
I promise.

37:44.700 --> 37:49.820
I mean,I had an operation,and everything went really well.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.280
So you're okay now?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.770
Yeah.

37:54.030 --> 37:58.760
I shoulda told you sooner,but I think... I was just scared.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.540
You were scared?

38:01.540 --> 38:03.350
Yeah.

38:03.350 --> 38:07.920
Everybody gets scared,even daddies.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.830
I'm sorry to interrupt,but it's--it's time.

38:20.830 --> 38:22.250
Oh,is courtney ready?

38:22.250 --> 38:24.670
Courtney's actually in the car.

38:24.880 --> 38:28.290
time to go.And listen,when I'm better,we're going camping.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.680
come on,come on.Chop-chop.You guys got a plane to catch.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.720
Bye,dad.love you.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.200
Do you,uh,need anything?

38:37.200 --> 38:38.900
No,I'm fine.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.540
Just... just shut the door.

38:42.540 --> 38:45.350
Sure.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.180
justin.

39:08.770 --> 39:11.340
are you okay?

39:13.020 --> 39:16.230
We broke up.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.950
Oh,I'm sorry.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.830
What happened?

39:20.830 --> 39:22.010
I don't want to talk about it.

39:22.010 --> 39:25.040
No,of course.Okay.

39:25.650 --> 39:28.370
And last night was awful,'cause all I could think about was using.

39:28.370 --> 39:33.940
Justin,if you need to stay here,you can stay as long as you like.

39:36.380 --> 39:40.160
-You mean that?
-Come on.Of course.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.770
Come here.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.400
Oh,babe.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.130
thank you,sarah.

39:50.130 --> 39:51.790
Now don't go overboard.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.710
You're gonna have to fight tommy for the couch.

39:55.530 --> 39:56.750
oh,jeez.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.930
this is some awesome!

39:58.930 --> 40:00.170
what is that?

40:00.170 --> 40:01.560
A barcalounger.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.310
Isn't it great?

40:14.860 --> 40:15.860
ryan.

40:15.860 --> 40:18.860
Hey,I just--I wanted to come by and check on you and make sure you were okay,

40:18.860 --> 40:23.070
you know,after last night and--and everything.

40:23.070 --> 40:26.930
Oh,that's really sweet of you.Thank you.

40:29.290 --> 40:30.880
well,it seems like you're okay.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.230
So I don't want to bother you or anything.

40:33.230 --> 40:35.750
Oh,no.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.000
Um... do you want to come inside?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.980
I was just,um,I was watching some tv.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.260
Yeah,that's what I've been doing at nora'S.

40:43.260 --> 40:45.300
I could really use a change of scenery.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.060
I could use the company.

40:49.330 --> 40:52.850
justin and I broke up.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.720
************

40:54.720 --> 40:57.710
