WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:09.260
Oh, so you gon' act like you forgot
what happened last week on "P-Valley"?

00:09.301 --> 00:12.930
Forcing deserving folk off their property
is not a way to run a city.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.517
Auction's only two weeks away,
and your ass is gon' be on the
block.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.436
You everybody punk, from what I heard.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.938
Nigga, you is dead to me!

00:20.980 --> 00:22.523
Somebody danced in my place?

00:22.565 --> 00:26.110
Yeah, they called her
M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter...

00:26.152 --> 00:28.279
Somebody done posted
a video of me from last night.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.281
Your vajayjay done went viral, girl.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.949
You don't know Patrice Woodbine.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.534
She stole from me.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.788
All the money I had stashed up
in the church building fund,

00:37.830 --> 00:40.583
she used it for her own fucking church.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.169
It was the only way
I could get Terricka back.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.422
You need to leave Terricka with
'Shelle.

00:46.464 --> 00:49.258
Need to let somebody take you on up
out this office for a minute.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.385
Where you gon' take me?

00:54.346 --> 00:56.098
Oh, fuck.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.350
- I'ma go talk to her.
- Let me handle her.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.187
My wife went missing
the day Hurricane Drake hit.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.690
I'll get my deputies to put up some flyers
around town quick-fast.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.484
What do you mean I'm not allowed
any more transfers?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.527
Apologies, Miss Savage,
but our records show

01:08.569 --> 01:10.571
that you've done over ten
in the past few days.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.615
I can run you ten stacks
by the end of the week.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.409
- What I got to do?
- We gon' need IDs.

01:15.451 --> 01:16.911
I know this man named Mane
that can hook us up.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.662
- How many you need?
- Ten.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.914
Okay.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.515
Oh, okay.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.360
Terricka, just give it
a little flick of the wrist.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.327
Hey.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.956
Yeah, she doing good.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.750
You look good out there.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.628
- Stop lying.
- Excuse me?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.005
Don't make me jump over this fence.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.882
Show some respect for your mama.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.760
You couldn't even be my mama
for, like, one weekend.

04:19.802 --> 04:23.138
I know you was supposed to come over last
weekend, but things went sideways a bit.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.600
I saw you on the Chucalissa news.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.061
Yeah.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.021
Well, despite my lil' detour,

04:31.063 --> 04:32.523
you best believe I'ma do exactly

04:32.564 --> 04:34.149
what I gots to do
to get right back on track.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.567
That's what you always say.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.278
Look, I know my gym not happening,
like, right-right now,

04:38.320 --> 04:40.781
but maybe 'Shelle'll let you
come back on the team.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.574
- I don't want to come back.
- But why?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.326
You love dance.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.202
No.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.831
I just love being around you.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.959
You said three months ago
that you was gon' talk to 'Shelle.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.753
You been sayin' it and sayin' it,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.922
that one day, I'ma come live wit'
you.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.925
- It's gon' happen.
- When?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.344
Everything all right over here?

05:02.386 --> 05:03.554
Yes, ma'am.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.597
Terricka, go on back to your lesson.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.099
- But, Ma...
- Don't "but, Ma" me.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.475
Get back over there.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.355
Child have any idea
how much Serena made last year?

05:14.023 --> 05:15.941
Mercedes, what you doin' here?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.609
She ain't return any of my textses.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.403
So you thought bum-rushin'
her tennis lesson

05:19.445 --> 05:21.780
was a good idea after you wound up in jail

05:21.822 --> 05:23.574
the first weekend
you supposed to spend with her?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.284
'Shelle, you know Patrice Woodbine.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.702
I know she be trying it,

05:26.744 --> 05:28.746
but you out here on the news
fighting like a lowlife,

05:28.787 --> 05:30.873
and Terricka can't be part of that shit.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.001
'Shelle, please, I got a room
made up for her and everything.

05:34.043 --> 05:38.380
Look, sometime a mama got to learn
how not to disappoint.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.383
I can't tell you how many times
I've had to get that girl

05:41.425 --> 05:44.178
up off the bathroom floor
every time she hears,

05:44.219 --> 05:46.305
"Mercedes not gon' make it today,
baby."

05:46.346 --> 05:49.016
I can't keep watching you
hurt my lil' girl.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.809
Your lil' girl?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.019
Funny.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.688
I do remember pushing her out my coochie.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.274
Cortez probably rolling over in his grave.

05:57.316 --> 06:00.819
Cortez ain't rolling nowhere
'cause I burned his cheating ass up.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.447
Don't come 'round here talking
about what her daddy might do,

06:03.489 --> 06:05.824
'cause he just ashes
in an urn on a mantel.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.285
I'm the one that's alive.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.995
I'm the one you need to deal with.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.915
I'm the one who's got custody.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.876
All I'm saying is that
she actually my blood,

06:15.918 --> 06:18.837
and I ain't gon' let her down,
come hell or high water.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.675
Look, I'm finna go. My Uber been waiting.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.472
Then go get your chariot,
but you just remember

06:28.514 --> 06:31.016
you got to prove
to a judge that you ready,

06:31.058 --> 06:34.686
but, most importantly,
you got to prove it to me.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.688
So you go have a blessed day.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.192
Okay, okay.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.746
- What?
- I didn't say nothin'.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.707
Bitch, even when you quiet,
you stay doin' the most.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.586
You a tennis coach now?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.926
Bitch! Oh, this cute.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.845
Can it actually kill people,

07:07.886 --> 07:09.847
like your dead baby daddy widow?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.933
I got it since we rolling
with this damn money.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.143
- Let's get to the next drop.
- Okay.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.478
I'ma ask Mane to get us some more IDs.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.149
You can be Thelma, and I'll be Louise.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.965
Look at you looking all,
like, krispy, baby Regal.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.468
We just won't tell Daddy
how much they cost.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.970
No, we won't.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.972
No, we won't.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.142
Oh, yeah.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.189
You late.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.776
Look, I don't know what you think
you saw the other night...

08:05.652 --> 08:08.447
...but if you think you 'bout to
bribe me,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.407
you got another thing coming.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.751
I don't even know what you
talkin' about right now.

08:24.504 --> 08:28.133
Actually, I brought you here
'cause I got a question for you.

08:29.843 --> 08:34.723
How, like, serious are you
about this music thing?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.733
Somebody linked it
to my 'Gram this morning.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.946
"Today's WorldStarHipHop fitness girl
of the day is @MissCrookedLetter

08:48.987 --> 08:52.199
going HAM on the pole to a fresh track
by rapper Lil"...

08:52.241 --> 08:53.617
Hold up.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.371
Mu'fuckin' WorldStarHipHop, man?

08:57.412 --> 08:59.623
- Yeah.
- I'm glowin' the fuck up.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.585
I'ma shoot this over to Woddy 'nem.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.836
What? For what?

09:04.878 --> 09:08.131
Who Woddy gon' slide it on to?
He ain't got no connections.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.509
He's just some weird-ass nigga
who grew up in a funeral home.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.886
- He my manager.
- What he managin'?

09:12.928 --> 09:16.765
You only got, like, five pictures
on your page, no tweets.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.351
You ain't got no brand and no base...

09:19.393 --> 09:21.395
at least not yet.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.107
You want to know how many folks
started followin' me

09:25.148 --> 09:26.400
since the video made the rounds?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.487
Get the fuck of here.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.534
There's something magnetic about a man
with a masterpiece on his arm.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.705
Folks find out you booed up
with a Dirty Delta dime,

09:39.746 --> 09:41.790
they ain't gon' know what to do.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.459
What, you tryin' to be Keyshia
Ka'Oir to my Gucci Mane?

09:44.501 --> 09:45.544
Yuh.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.255
Bitches got to want to fuck you,

09:48.297 --> 09:50.299
and niggas got to want to be you.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.636
I likes that line.
I'ma throw that in my next joint.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.930
Well, credit the right person.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.309
That's Uncle Clifford's line, not mine.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.066
This been goin' for a Mississippi
minute.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.527
I don't know what you talkin' 'bout.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.070
Black girls don't bruise.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113
Yeah, they do.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.745
So we gon' build
on this momentum or what?

10:19.786 --> 10:23.290
'Cause, you know, as fast this shit
hit, fast as it can go away.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.542
What your man gon' think?

10:26.335 --> 10:27.711
He gon' be cool with it.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.921
He ain't got no choice but to be.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.424
Aight, then.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.343
Whatchu got in mind?

10:39.348 --> 10:41.391
What's yo' selfie game like?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.066
Right.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.945
It's okay, baby.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.627
Nigga, where you think you going?

12:32.669 --> 12:33.962
To the kitchen.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.840
Come on.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.801
Dance with your Gran Muva.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.056
Come on, baby.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.490
All right, now.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.283
Folks wouldn't know you was blind.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.496
I don't need no eyes, child, to cut a rug.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.665
I just needs my feets.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.668
And I hold off on that sugar,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.837
I keeps my feets.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.297
What you said.

13:19.341 --> 13:23.887
I remember when James Brown
came on down to the joint.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.973
He thought he was somebody,

13:27.015 --> 13:30.101
but soon as he showed up, I showed out!

13:30.894 --> 13:33.104
So you trying to tell me you
done out-danced James Brown?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.357
Now, I don't know if that's
a tall tale or a lie.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.900
Wait a minute, now.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.694
- You tried it. You tried it.
- Oh, help me up.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.154
Oh, yeah.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.574
See, them girls you got
working down at The Pynk

13:44.616 --> 13:46.284
think they doing some shit,

13:46.326 --> 13:50.288
but they don't know folks been dropping it
like it's hot in that spot

13:50.330 --> 13:54.459
since before they mamas
and daddies was even thought of.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.253
Come on, now, baby, hand me my blunt.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.173
Hey.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.342
Yeah, baby.

14:09.891 --> 14:13.770
You know, they say weed
bring back your sight.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.525
It don't,

14:18.567 --> 14:23.113
but it sure as hell make you forget
you ain't got it.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.245
You want some of them
neck bones I cooked up?

14:30.287 --> 14:33.164
- No, I ain't hungry.
- What's they name?

14:33.206 --> 14:36.710
- Who name?
- That nigga, owl.

14:36.751 --> 14:40.255
- Mind your bitness.
- Your bitness is my bitness.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.756
No, the bitness you need
to be worrying about

14:41.798 --> 14:43.967
is this damn club
you done saddled me with.

14:44.593 --> 14:45.927
There you go again.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.137
What...

14:47.178 --> 14:48.597
You know, all them loans you done took out

14:48.638 --> 14:51.558
to keep Ernestine's afloat,
they still ain't do shit.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.936
Well, you was the one
who said turning a juke joint

14:54.978 --> 14:56.980
into a shake joint was gon' save
it.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.316
Well, coochie can only do so much.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.862
The Pynk is going up
on the auction block next week.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.865
Next week? How in the hell...

15:06.906 --> 15:09.034
How in the hell? This is how in the hell.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.828
Right here.

15:13.455 --> 15:17.500
This refinancing loan,
that one, this payday loan,

15:17.542 --> 15:20.629
that one, this one,
just all this shit here, Gran Muva.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.505
I mean, you know, it's probably
more in the kitchen.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.632
You right.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.637
I signed some things
I shouldn't have signed.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.556
I ain't seen the numbers wasn't right.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.894
But you done signed some shit
you wasn't supposed to sign, too.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.773
That's 'cause I wanted a champagne room,
not no Zinfandel room.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.609
Now, look, I took on some debt,
but look what I started out with.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.488
Gran Muva, I think
we gon' lose it this time.

15:47.530 --> 15:50.075
Clifford Sayles, that is not an
option.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.077
Well, we done run out of them.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.662
I ain't got no more money.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.957
The Pynk is gone.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.293
It's gone.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.673
Look, I think it's time
you get on your knees

16:04.714 --> 16:05.924
and ask your God for a favor.

16:05.965 --> 16:10.053
Oh, God don't want His dick sucked
by me. I still got my teeth.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.846
Oh, God, you just so uncouth.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.682
Oh, Clifford.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.601
Something gon' happen.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.644
I see it.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.314
You ought to bring him on by.

16:22.273 --> 16:25.026
Ain't nobody bringing nobody
over here on no date.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.736
Well, we could put a whole lot of love

16:26.778 --> 16:30.281
in that pot of neck bones,
you know what I'm saying?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.701
That ain't gon'...

16:35.704 --> 16:37.414
...work.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.120
What the fuck?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.549
- Big L?
- What's happening, man?

17:30.759 --> 17:32.552
How the fuck you find me here?

17:32.594 --> 17:35.555
Neighborhood candy man
ain't never hard to find, man.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.726
Come on, man.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.574
Please don't...

17:55.366 --> 17:56.951
Don't tell Gidget I'm in town, all right?

17:57.494 --> 17:58.995
No, for real, now.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.164
Yeah, I'm the last person
you have to worry about.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.374
That motel manager's a Deep Throat.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.586
Yeah, sadly, she ain't got one, though.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.589
She a good brand manager, though.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.007
The way you looking,

18:11.049 --> 18:13.218
she must have figured
you needed a lil' relief.

18:14.803 --> 18:18.389
I don't get high,
but I might need me a supply.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.808
You want to hold something?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.936
I thought The Pynk was too good
for that stash life.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.396
This ain't about what
Uncle Clifford would do.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.816
It's about what Big L gon' do.

18:29.025 --> 18:29.984
So you was serious,

18:30.026 --> 18:31.945
what you said when you helped me load
the truck last time?

18:31.986 --> 18:33.238
I don't know if you heard,

18:33.279 --> 18:35.365
but The Pynk ain't got long
for this world.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.742
Yeah, I heard something on the matter.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.911
Yeah, you gon' need somebody
to stash your shit.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.705
Well, where you gon' stash
since The Pynk be closing?

18:42.747 --> 18:44.541
Don't worry about all that.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.834
Well, if you babysitting my shit,

18:45.875 --> 18:47.252
I'ma need to know
where to pick it up, now.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.421
I got ways of hiding things.
Just need a time and a chance.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.175
What Uncle Clifford say

18:54.217 --> 18:56.427
if she knew you even held shit
there for a minute?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.806
Uncle Clifford ain't gon' find out,
but if she do,

18:59.848 --> 19:01.808
I'll tell her this...

19:01.850 --> 19:05.436
"You saved me from death once before.
Now it's high time for me to save you."

19:09.232 --> 19:10.233
All right, bro.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.906
I'll pay you 5K for the first hold.

19:16.948 --> 19:17.866
Bet.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.050
Welcome, pick nail color.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.852
Phiphuong told me 'bout your five
o'clock. Sit down and kiki with me.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.939
That was English.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.864
- What you doing here?
- I gots me a hot date tonight.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.449
So I'm here to get slayed.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.658
What 'bout you?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.243
Oh, don't tell me, this is your me time,

20:02.285 --> 20:04.120
'cause I know most
of your time be the Mayor's.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.496
He do keep me busy.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.499
You been working down there at city hall.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.170
You done forgot all about
your family at The Pynk.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.880
I sure wish you had told us
about your boss

20:13.922 --> 20:15.465
expediting that foreclosure notice.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.258
I didn't know nothing about that.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.676
Oh, like hell you ain't know.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.763
A stripper-turned-house mother
know how to stay with open ears, okay?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.140
I'm actually hurt.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.517
As much as The Pynk done for you...

20:27.143 --> 20:29.145
You was the first hoe I graduated.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.690
Show a bitch some mu'fuckin'
gratitude.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.526
I'll always be grateful for The Pynk.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.363
That was truly a stepping-stone for me.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.573
Well, the man you working for
trying to put a tombstone

20:40.615 --> 20:42.283
on the one ladder left in this town

20:42.325 --> 20:45.662
for pretty big-booty bitches like you.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.752
Now, if there's any tea you can spill,

20:52.794 --> 20:54.671
lukewarm or scorching,

20:54.712 --> 20:56.172
I needs to sip it.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.718
You was the first ho I graduated,

21:00.760 --> 21:04.472
but you best make sure
that you ain't the last.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.701
This bitch.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.413
It got, like, 365,287
mu'fuckin' views.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.749
You'd think Keyshawn's 'Gram was a mirror,
you looking at it so much.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.792
Girl, please.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.963
That's to get your car out the impound.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.258
Now, if we split up, you hit the Telex
up in Tupelo and Booneville.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.135
Fucking Booneville, man?

21:42.176 --> 21:44.512
Best be some gas money up in here, too.

21:44.554 --> 21:48.349
And since you ain't at The Pynk,
I'ma need the combination to your locker.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.393
My refrigerator won't close no more.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.229
Well, you stupid, you tryin'
to hide money up in a locker.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.148
Not as stupid as a church building
fund.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.733
Duly noted, bitch.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.485
And next time you want to
squirrel away some scrilla...

21:59.527 --> 22:00.570
You like that?

22:00.611 --> 22:03.197
I been running with you so much,
I'm beginning to sound like you.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.407
Bitch, you wish.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.494
But for real, though,
next time, put your money

22:08.536 --> 22:11.289
where nobody can find it...
offshore account.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.082
Transfer it into Bitcoin.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.710
- Bitch coin?
- Bitcoin.

22:15.752 --> 22:19.380
After you change the currency,
you can transfer cash again and again,

22:19.422 --> 22:21.257
just like what we doing now.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.800
We best not get caught.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.178
How you gon' get caught
stealin' your own money?

22:25.219 --> 22:28.848
Well, I just know by the end of this week,
I'll have 10K, halfway there.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.516
I'ma put it right down on another gym.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.311
Look, if you ain't gon' take
my other piece of advice,

22:33.352 --> 22:35.146
at least take this.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.190
You gon' need an investor
for that dance gym.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.609
- Spread the risk.
- And spread the reward?

22:39.650 --> 22:42.820
I ain't gon' have nobody to thank
but my damn self when my gym pop off.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.822
Just giving a friendly piece of ad...

22:46.074 --> 22:47.408
Advice.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.208
Hey, pickup for Watkins.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.420
What? Y'all ain't talking no more?

23:00.421 --> 23:03.216
Nope, ain't spoken to him in over a week.

23:06.135 --> 23:10.098
Girl, with the look he done shot
over here, even my ass is pregnant.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.308
Shut up.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.853
You smart to dead that shit,
especially if a nigga spoil yo'
appetite.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.896
Let it go.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.064
Check, please.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.857
Y'all good. That gentleman
just handled y'all bill.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.652
Damn!

23:22.693 --> 23:25.279
You finessed him without even looking?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.907
God damn you high yellow heifers.

23:33.204 --> 23:35.289
They say Confederate General Pemberton

23:35.331 --> 23:37.834
fired this at the beginning
of the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.087
Look at that steel catch trigger,
that walnut wood stock.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.672
Boy, she's a beauty.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.508
Be careful with that, Andre.
Might have some bullets.

23:47.552 --> 23:50.138
I never thought I'd get
to hold a Spencer carbine.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.017
Hey, now, well, you know your guns.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.062
Oh, I think I watched
one too many episodes of "Drunk History."

24:00.106 --> 24:02.859
Speaking of drunk,
that's where I'm headed.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.360
You pour me another one,
would you, Corbin?

24:05.361 --> 24:06.779
You know, this little baby here...

24:06.821 --> 24:08.406
one of Wyatt's favorite things
we inherited.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.241
- Yes, sir.
- Mine was the farm.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.536
Well, I'll keep the gun.
This land can go to hell.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.371
All right, Wyatt, come on, now.

24:20.543 --> 24:23.254
Well, let's do this
the old-fashioned way this time.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.882
I just need y'all's signatures.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.050
What was it you said before?

24:28.092 --> 24:30.344
Most any landowner got
per acreage in all...

24:30.386 --> 24:32.388
Of Mississippi history?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.600
Let's go ahead and sign this fucker.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.144
Then you and I, we can open up
Daddy's bottle of bourbon.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.187
Amen, brother.

24:42.857 --> 24:45.568
Corbin, why don't you go ahead
and sign first?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.217
What you doing, Corbin?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.220
I'm still reading.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.641
Come on, now, stop pretending
you's a lawyer and sign the damn deal.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.486
- I can't.
- I told you, Wayne.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.154
I told you he was gonna up
and do this shit.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.531
Leasing to the casino
is what we should be doing.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.742
- Tell him, Andre.
- Did you hear the man?

25:34.784 --> 25:37.328
This is the most anyone's
ever gotten here in history.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.247
It ain't just about the money
to me, Wayne.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.415
- What the fuck is it about?
- Legacy.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.793
What, you's want to leave
something for your kinfolk?

25:43.834 --> 25:44.835
Is that what this is?

25:44.877 --> 25:47.004
Why you think you where
you at right now, huh?

25:47.046 --> 25:49.215
Things been passed down to you,

25:49.257 --> 25:51.425
and it ain't my fault
you done blew it all away.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.719
Daddy told us we need to make something
out of our inheritance.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.264
Daddy didn't give a shit
about our inheritance.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.725
The only thing he gave a damn about
was guns and pussy,

25:59.767 --> 26:02.853
and he damn near ran this family
into the ground playing with both.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.648
Why you want to give this up?

26:06.941 --> 26:08.985
We need to keep it in the family,

26:09.026 --> 26:10.611
do what Daddy wanted.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.030
I don't want nothing to do with that man.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.534
Fact, I'm happy he's in the grave...

26:17.285 --> 26:19.245
...'cause if he wasn't,
I would've put him there myself

26:19.287 --> 26:21.580
on account of what he did
to his real family.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.627
I am real.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.340
And you gon' have to deal
with me for life.

26:33.050 --> 26:36.137
Look, I'm not a family therapist.
I'm just a lawyer.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.139
And if y'all don't come
to an agreement today,

26:38.180 --> 26:40.057
then Promised Land will have to walk away.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.560
- Then nobody gets...
- I've had about enough of this shit.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.396
- What the fuck are you doing, Wayne?
- What the fuck you think I'm doing?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.317
There ain't any bullets in there.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.319
Is there?

26:52.862 --> 26:55.114
Now, you know so much
about history, Andre.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.867
Why don't you tell me who won
the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou?

26:57.908 --> 27:00.202
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, now, Morehouse.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.370
They ain't teach you that?

27:01.412 --> 27:02.330
The Confederacy.

27:05.541 --> 27:09.545
But it was the Union
that eventually won, Wayne.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.548
Well, see, now...

27:14.133 --> 27:16.135
...contrary to popular belief...

27:16.844 --> 27:19.472
...Civil War ain't over yet.

27:20.348 --> 27:24.185
Fact, sometimes I wonder
if it's just begun.

27:28.856 --> 27:29.940
I'll sign.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.361
I'll sign.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.365
I'll sign.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.174
Well, look at that.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.385
It's empty.

28:03.808 --> 28:08.104
And I told Ike if he laid hand
one more 'gain on Tina,

28:08.145 --> 28:12.483
I was gon' stuff a cone
in his ass my damn self.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.443
Gran Muva, why don't you
quit telling a story?

28:14.485 --> 28:16.278
Oh, let the elder speak.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.572
Oh, hell, nigga,

28:18.614 --> 28:21.534
stories is all a old lady got.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.661
You see that picture
over in the far corner?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.870
Come on, let me show you.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.664
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.958
Now, see? See there?

28:28.999 --> 28:33.295
There, that's me and Ann Peebles.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.925
Honey, when she sang this song,

28:37.967 --> 28:40.469
she about made the corrugated roof

28:40.511 --> 28:43.973
turn straight like a white girl's hair.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.809
Now, most folks don't know,

28:46.851 --> 28:49.395
but Ernestine's is where
she met her manager,

28:49.437 --> 28:52.148
and, well, the rest is her-story.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.985
Seems like Ernestine's juke joint
was good on making stars.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.279
You might want to go
and put my picture up there.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.864
Oh, you sing?

28:59.905 --> 29:00.823
Rap.

29:01.866 --> 29:04.535
Well, if Ernestine's was still around,

29:04.577 --> 29:07.705
but I don't think them girls at The Pynk

29:07.746 --> 29:11.000
is gon' share they pole with you.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.378
Don't matter.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.921
It's all gon' be over soon.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.466
Well...

29:19.341 --> 29:22.636
...no one expected us
to last this long anyhow.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.141
I remember a time when Pussy Valley

29:27.183 --> 29:30.478
was more packed than hell.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.022
You see, they pushed all us hos

29:33.063 --> 29:36.317
to the end of the universe near the river.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.279
And one by one, each brothel...

29:41.071 --> 29:44.033
...was felled by flame and by flood,

29:44.074 --> 29:47.495
but our lil' spot just kept on
truckin'.

29:48.996 --> 29:52.666
Some say it was 'cause of God's grace,

29:52.708 --> 29:54.793
but I'm a practical bitch.

29:54.835 --> 29:59.048
I says it was 'cause we was on that bluff

29:59.089 --> 30:00.716
'sides the levee.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.302
I call it luck.

30:04.136 --> 30:08.891
But maybe it truly was...

30:09.517 --> 30:11.310
...God's grace.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.939
Seems like The Pynk's built to last, then.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.317
There's not much on this Earth that is.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.278
That's why I say
if you got something good,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.447
you got to keep hold to it.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.699
You hear me, Clifford?

30:27.993 --> 30:30.287
And who is this lil' nigga?

30:31.413 --> 30:33.541
Goddamn.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.834
You was a snaggletooth-ass queen.

30:35.876 --> 30:39.255
Nigga, fuck you.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.509
Honey, that boy came out
the coochie switching.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.315
Oh, what, you gots to go?

31:00.609 --> 31:01.777
Nah.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.822
Nah, I'm good. I'm good.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.785
Go on and top you off
with a little somethin'.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.581
- What is it?
- Come here. Smell that.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.126
That's good. That smell good.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.252
Your guy don't got that.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.170
Oh, now, he can come back.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.808
- Y'all.
- Yes?

31:36.186 --> 31:38.689
Your girl up here doing the most.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.234
It's your girl
Miss M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter

31:42.276 --> 31:46.530
chopping it up with my partner
in crime, Lil' Murda!

31:48.198 --> 31:50.492
God is really shining down on me now.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.077
And the Devil gon' be
right there behind him.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.788
If y'all fell for "Fallin'," y'all
gonna go hard fuh this next joint.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.249
Just y'all niggas wait.
Inspired by my Mississippi
Pride-Pride...

31:57.291 --> 31:58.917
Yo' baby daddy gon' be lit over
this.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.294
Stupid-ass ho.

32:00.336 --> 32:03.422
- What the fuck is you doing, Keyshawn?
- It ain't nothing.

32:03.464 --> 32:05.466
We was just throwin'
a lil' something to the stans.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.134
They was hangry.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.386
- This ain't no kind of good.
- What y'all so scared for?

32:33.202 --> 32:36.997
Wonder what Mercedes would think
about you taking over her locker.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.249
Same thing she think
about you taking over her spot.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.544
But unlike her...

32:45.255 --> 32:47.049
...I share my shit.

32:50.094 --> 32:53.305
Combination 34-36-15.

33:38.892 --> 33:41.520
Uncle Clifford, can you believe
some of these folks drove

33:41.562 --> 33:43.355
all the way from Biloxi to see me?

33:43.397 --> 33:45.232
Like, can you believe it?

33:45.274 --> 33:46.692
This shit going all, like, worldwide.

33:46.734 --> 33:50.779
Oh, bitch, Biloxi is down the street.
It ain't worldwide.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.948
You know what I mean.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.326
How you feel about a night
with me as the headliner?

33:58.829 --> 34:02.332
They have eyes,
but they do not have sense.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.959
Slow your roll, Miss Missy.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.670
We could call it Murda Night.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.715
Hear me on out, now.

34:09.757 --> 34:13.177
With Mercedes gone,
you ain't got no kind of headliner.

34:13.218 --> 34:14.678
Lil Murda song popping.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.014
Even WorldStar done said
it's, like, the pick of the week.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.849
Between me and him,
we could bring the folks on in here

34:18.891 --> 34:20.267
before this go away for serious.

34:20.309 --> 34:21.977
Did Lil' Murda put you up to this?

34:22.019 --> 34:25.439
No, but we workin' together now.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.566
Don't be J.

34:28.150 --> 34:32.404
So this is goin' down, like, this Sunday.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.740
Invites goin' on the 'Gram tonight.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.242
Keyshawn, you best not
be trying to run me, heifer.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.120
Hey!

34:40.162 --> 34:41.663
Oh, Murda Night.

34:43.999 --> 34:45.793
I taught her so well.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.344
Don't blow up on my doorstep, boy.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.638
Girl, you know you want my slime.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.306
Nigga, whatever. Give me the goods, now.

35:01.975 --> 35:06.522
So I got you a Jaderia Wilkins
and a DeeDee Strom.

35:06.563 --> 35:10.567
I got homegirl a Amber Cross
and a Bryanna Jackson.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.277
Why I get Jaderia and she get Amber?

35:12.319 --> 35:14.696
Well, you want these folks
to believe y'all's lies, now, don't you?

35:16.907 --> 35:18.617
Fine ass.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.161
Damn.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.419
So that's it.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.171
Just these last few, and we done.

35:31.213 --> 35:32.339
Damn, girl.

35:32.381 --> 35:33.715
If I'd known
you was running stacks like this,

35:33.757 --> 35:35.425
I'd been tried to be your girlfriend.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.011
But alas, I's celibate.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.304
Well, what about Mane?

35:39.346 --> 35:41.598
Girl, you can't smash
in your own backyard,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.642
but I loves to finger myself

35:43.684 --> 35:46.019
to that lil' bow-legged mu'fucka
right there.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.980
I can't with you.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.065
- Where's the restroom?
- Right thataway.

35:50.107 --> 35:53.652
The way you make your Kool-Aid
is trash, by the way.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.196
Yeah, yeah, bitch, and your mama.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.509
I know you hard of hearing,

36:17.551 --> 36:19.428
but I know you ain't hard of seeing.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.097
So I know you seen this ain't
no mu'fuckin' bathroom.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.349
My bad.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.101
I thought it was, so I just...

36:26.894 --> 36:28.103
You like it, though?

36:33.150 --> 36:34.276
The walls...

36:35.903 --> 36:37.654
...they're a good girl color.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.658
That's what I was thinking.

36:43.911 --> 36:47.873
Only thing is,
she fucking hates purple now.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.460
She likes fucking green.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.922
So she got it from her mama.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.934
I been decorating this room
for seven years.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.606
Got the bed from the pawnshop,

37:12.648 --> 37:14.691
bed skirt from Dollar Tree.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.401
What about that glitter pillow?

37:16.443 --> 37:18.320
Bitch, Marshalls had a sale.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.324
Folks always ask why I stay in Chucalissa.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.161
Go to Memphis, Atlanta.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.331
You make more
at the clubs there than here.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.960
Her not living here is far enough.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.546
Time gonna come when I got her with me...

37:37.756 --> 37:38.966
...where she belong...

37:39.967 --> 37:41.718
…with her real mama.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.554
What's her name?

37:46.765 --> 37:47.933
Terricka.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.479
What's yours?

37:56.358 --> 37:57.567
Autumn.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.993
It's hard livin' without them, ain't it?

38:08.870 --> 38:10.372
Some days...

38:12.582 --> 38:14.334
...it's hard livin' at all.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.962
No, it ain't never that bad, baby.

38:17.671 --> 38:21.049
Whatever make you feel like that,
give it the chop.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.385
That's what I done learned
in this lil' life of mine.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.430
Bones meant to be put in they grave.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.598
You're lucky.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.813
You get to be with her again.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.357
You have to do

38:37.399 --> 38:40.610
everything in your power to do that.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.240
Hey I'm...

38:45.824 --> 38:48.243
You said the bathroom was this way, right?

38:52.122 --> 38:54.249
Bora Bora's looking good on you, Bill.

38:54.291 --> 38:57.377
I'm supposed to be paragliding
with my wife in a few, Mr. Watkins.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.171
Well, I promise to keep this short.

38:59.212 --> 39:02.007
So the sale of Kyle Farms...
we're supposed to be good, right?

39:02.049 --> 39:03.842
You got that signature?

39:04.676 --> 39:08.013
Wayne Kyle and his brother, Corbin,
couldn't come to an agreement.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.599
I couldn't get the signature.
But they may be willing to lease.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.393
Shit. Well, that's it for Chucalissa.

39:13.435 --> 39:16.813
Maybe we got to go
to another town up the river and build.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.024
Need I remind you
we're already getting The Pynk

39:19.066 --> 39:20.609
for below our 200K cap,

39:20.650 --> 39:22.944
and Chucalissa is on the crux
of three states...

39:22.986 --> 39:25.405
Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee...

39:25.447 --> 39:27.824
with a major interstate
slicing right through,

39:27.866 --> 39:30.619
straight on the Mississippi River
beside a bluff...

39:30.660 --> 39:32.412
- I understand that.
- ...and on a levee.

39:32.454 --> 39:35.415
When you find the one,
you put a ring on it,

39:35.457 --> 39:36.541
and to do that,

39:36.583 --> 39:38.668
I think we should lease
the Kyle farm instead.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.045
- Lease?
- Pay the Kyle family

39:40.087 --> 39:41.963
what they're worth, not what they want.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.008
Lock them into a leasing fee
of $15,000 per month.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.053
Well, just get it done, or you're done,

39:48.095 --> 39:50.388
and so is that 5% commission.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.560
Fuck, yeah.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.785
It's yuh girl Miss Mississippi.

40:11.827 --> 40:15.455
We out here in the cut

40:15.497 --> 40:16.581

40:18.834 --> 40:21.002
You hear that? Lil' Murda on the
track.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.089
DJ Neva Scared on that 808 and that
Mooge.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.549
Holla!

40:25.590 --> 40:29.010
Tell yuh friends that slayage
is going down at The Pynk.

40:29.052 --> 40:32.222
Slide through this Sunday
for Murda Night.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.557
You don't want to miss it.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.934
My niggas finna get bodied
up in that bitch.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.145
Murda Night.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.105
Good looking out, Keyshawn.

40:40.147 --> 40:42.315
Look, if we ain't have an in,
I don't know what we would do.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.860
- What the fuck you mean by that?
- Damn, nigga.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.821
Why you always on jump mode?
Nigga, I ain't Pico.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.991
I'm just talking to lil' shawty
and DJ over there.

40:51.032 --> 40:54.327
You just need to pack The Pynk out
like it's a problem.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.746
You call yourself my manager,
then manage it, nigga.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.915
You over there worried about advertising.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.750
You ain't got a new song yet, my nigga.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.336
Damn, young one,
let me rest my laurels a little bit.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.546
This one just bust.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.965
Yeah, your folk gon'
want to know what's next.

41:07.007 --> 41:10.844
You would've already had a song,
but you missing your sessions.

41:11.428 --> 41:15.182
Qwan said he text you the other
night and you said you was gon'
slide through.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.434
But you ain't pull up, so what's up?

41:21.646 --> 41:23.231
He was busy.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.984
Yeah, you see it.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.785
Let's get to work. Come on, y'all.

41:53.929 --> 41:56.181
- Hey, babe.
- Baby, what up, though?

41:56.223 --> 41:57.390
Been trying to catch you.

41:57.432 --> 41:58.892
Oh, I just finished my rounds.

41:58.934 --> 42:01.269
Can you believe another gunshot wound?

42:01.311 --> 42:04.231
For some strange reason,
you sound happy about that.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.398
No.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.942
Well, kind of.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.987
- So what are you doing?
- Oh, you know, the usual.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.573
Come on, you never tell me about work.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.242
Long story short...

42:16.368 --> 42:18.411
...I saved my company millions of dollars.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.038
Baby, that's great!

42:20.080 --> 42:22.207
Look at you doing the do, okay.

42:22.249 --> 42:23.458
Yeah, I did that.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.503
Only thing is,
God-daddy might get a bit mad.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.421
Why? He's always so proud of you.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.549
Well, once he finds out
what I did in this new deal,

42:31.591 --> 42:33.051
he may be a bit pissy.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.472
But, hey, it's for the greater good.

42:41.643 --> 42:44.104
Hey. Hey, you there?

42:44.145 --> 42:45.689
Yeah, I'm here.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.357
Oh, it's just, you kind of froze there.

42:47.399 --> 42:49.109
No, my connection is good here.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.569
Do you think that was a good idea?

42:51.611 --> 42:53.280
I mean, why bite the hand that feeds you?

42:53.321 --> 42:55.448
Maybe because the hand
is being shady as fuck

42:55.490 --> 42:56.449
and needs a little nibbling.

42:56.491 --> 42:57.909
He knows what his city needs.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.078
I mean, you're just
some outsider flying in...

43:00.120 --> 43:01.913
Outsider?

43:01.955 --> 43:03.456
Chucalissa's my home.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.792
No, Atlanta's your home.

43:07.502 --> 43:11.298
Andre, look, I miss you.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.092
I miss your hugs...

43:14.884 --> 43:16.970
...your kisses, your...

43:17.012 --> 43:19.931
Look, I got to go finish this new deal.

43:19.973 --> 43:21.558
I'ma hit you back a little later,
all right?

43:21.599 --> 43:22.726
- Bye, babe.
- Andre...

44:10.231 --> 44:13.693
All right, bitches, these day laborers
here is spending that dough.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.362
Y'all better go on out there,
get this mo...

44:16.154 --> 44:17.614
Hello? Hello?

44:17.655 --> 44:20.116
Jupiter, girl, you going
to nursing school?

44:20.158 --> 44:21.493
Child, that's so good.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.203
Girl, I told my mama on her deathbed

44:23.244 --> 44:25.330
that I was gonna get
that nursing degree, okay?

44:25.372 --> 44:26.748
Okay, child.

44:26.790 --> 44:28.416
Well, lookie here.

44:28.458 --> 44:32.337
Eloise done finally come back to the slums
to kick it with the serfs.

44:32.379 --> 44:33.588
Do my eyes deceive me?

44:33.630 --> 44:35.924
'Cause I know that ain't no Eloise.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.178
Maite, ramen noodles, please.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.516
I got to tell you, child,
I don't miss this desk right here.

44:44.557 --> 44:47.977
Well, I'm sorry we ain't got
the good oak you accustomed to

44:48.019 --> 44:49.646
at the mayor's office.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.314
- Lucky we got wood at all.
- You know what?

44:51.356 --> 44:53.942
You keep yapping, you can go
on back to gutting them houses,

44:53.983 --> 44:55.443
talking about my wood.

44:55.485 --> 44:58.363
Don't make me fire your ass
and bring back Eloise, now.

44:58.405 --> 45:01.908
Uncle Clifford, can we take
this reunion outside?

45:03.827 --> 45:06.496
I listen to them talk shit
like I ain't there,

45:06.538 --> 45:08.581
like I'm some kind of wallpaper.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.292
And at first, I was like, "How dare they?"

45:11.334 --> 45:13.628
And then my silence got real loud.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.589
Now, this casino is just the beginning.

45:16.631 --> 45:20.510
They got plans to turn this town
into some kind of Candyland,

45:20.552 --> 45:22.220
and I'm like, "For who?"

45:22.804 --> 45:24.764
First the casino, then the outlet,

45:24.806 --> 45:28.435
then some kind of subdivision
called Casey's Plantation.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.603
You hear what I'm saying?

45:30.645 --> 45:32.730
Now, I've been blessed

45:32.772 --> 45:35.233
to be the wallpaper
in the room where it happens,

45:35.275 --> 45:37.110
and this is happening.

45:37.152 --> 45:39.529
Now, they trying to slip
this shit through on the low,

45:39.571 --> 45:41.406
but they gots to follow the law.

45:44.242 --> 45:47.036
- What this is?
- Charter for the city council.

45:48.246 --> 45:51.040
Now, with regard to gambling
in Mississippi,

45:51.082 --> 45:54.794
the city council can push through a casino
without a city vote.

45:54.836 --> 45:58.173
You trying to tell me that Wayne Kyle
and his six good old boys on the council

45:58.214 --> 46:00.550
can force this casino shit
just down our throats?

46:00.592 --> 46:01.676
They can try.

46:01.718 --> 46:03.136
Only thing that can stop them

46:03.178 --> 46:06.181
is a petition for a citywide vote
on the casino.

46:06.222 --> 46:08.683
Oh, man, you know these niggas don't vote.

46:08.725 --> 46:12.228
True, niggas don't vote,
and crackers vote for the wrong crackers.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.522
But one thing I do know

46:14.564 --> 46:16.232
is that these niggas round here

46:16.274 --> 46:18.693
love them some titties
on a Saturday night.

46:18.735 --> 46:21.488
Hey, more than they love God
on Sunday morning.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.365
Mayor Ruffin might reign over Chucalissa,

46:24.407 --> 46:26.743
but last I checked,

46:26.784 --> 46:29.954
Clifford Sayles is the mayor
of Pussy Valley.

46:47.472 --> 46:48.306
You?

46:48.348 --> 46:49.682
You posted my bail?

46:49.724 --> 46:51.726
Who else you think it was gon' be?

46:51.768 --> 46:55.230
Ain't nobody descending from no heavens
to come bail yo' ass out.

46:55.897 --> 46:57.815
I'm your Jesus tonight.

46:57.857 --> 46:59.442
I don't need no saving from you.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.110
You need some saving from somebody.

47:01.152 --> 47:04.280
Who done come for you?
I know Mercedes ain't.

47:04.322 --> 47:07.075
You been in here nine days
and was gon' be in here nine more

47:07.116 --> 47:09.661
if I ain't walk into Vale's Bail
and lay it down.

47:09.702 --> 47:11.079
You's a lie.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.164
You ain't paid no stacks for my bail.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.874
Oh, no, no, no, no, you right.

47:14.916 --> 47:17.877
I ain't put no money down
on your triflin' ass.

47:17.919 --> 47:19.754
But I did put down my club.

47:21.798 --> 47:24.217
- You put down your club?
- Sure did.

47:24.259 --> 47:26.511
See, that's another way they get us.

47:26.553 --> 47:29.097
Folks be so desperate
to get they loved ones out of jail,

47:29.138 --> 47:30.890
they willing to bet the whole farm,

47:30.932 --> 47:32.225
and the way I see it,

47:32.267 --> 47:34.894
it's about to be put up
on the auction block anyway,

47:34.936 --> 47:36.813
so it was a gamble I was willing to take.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.107
- You must want something.
- Of course I do.

47:39.148 --> 47:40.900
Well, I don't make deals with devils.

47:40.942 --> 47:42.819
Well, I do.

47:44.571 --> 47:49.367
And, bitch,
you best not be no flight risk.

47:50.243 --> 47:53.788
Since I got you out, you owe me.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.208
What you want from me?

47:58.918 --> 48:00.378
You say you want that church?

48:01.671 --> 48:03.381
How much you willing to pay for it?

48:41.085 --> 48:43.713
Andre, you there?

48:43.755 --> 48:46.049
Yeah. Yeah.

48:46.883 --> 48:49.177
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

48:49.218 --> 48:51.846
No worries, none at all.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.933
Thank you for the food.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.227
Oh, you didn't have to call me for that.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.606
Let me show you I have some home training.

49:01.648 --> 49:02.857
Okay.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.945
How you doing, Hailey?

49:12.909 --> 49:16.412
Chucalissa looks so beautiful

49:16.454 --> 49:18.206
in the morning from here.

49:20.208 --> 49:21.459
Are you at The Mounds?

49:22.377 --> 49:24.671
I wanted to see it one more time...

49:26.089 --> 49:27.048
...before I go.

49:30.468 --> 49:33.888
- Can I...
- I think I'm better as a memory.

49:35.682 --> 49:38.518
I know it might not feel
like it sometimes,

49:38.559 --> 49:42.021
but you're right where you
need to be, right here.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.608
Try telling my wife that.

49:50.905 --> 49:52.490
Good-bye, Andre.

50:20.309 --> 50:22.270
Boy, bring your fat ass on.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.152
Shit.

50:29.193 --> 50:32.238
Man, this the last time
I'm babysitting yo' bracelet.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.531
Man, shut up.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.492
Your fat ass always crying and shit.

50:41.330 --> 50:42.957
Now, you stay fed, don't it?

50:44.125 --> 50:45.334
Aight, then.

50:56.262 --> 50:57.722
What the fuck?
