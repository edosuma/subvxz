00:57.870 --> 01:02.041
Well, the president just saw me come.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.918
Oh...

01:07.044 --> 01:08.879
- You don't like my giraffe?
- No.

01:11.448 --> 01:15.368
You know I'm divorced twice
and have a daughter in college, right?

01:15.435 --> 01:19.273
- It's on your Wikipedia page.
- Wikipedia.

01:19.355 --> 01:20.982
Christ.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.944
I don't have any expectations.

01:25.361 --> 01:27.447
I never have, of anyone.

01:28.573 --> 01:29.992
You shouldn't either.

01:32.661 --> 01:35.081
How many events have we skipped today?

01:35.164 --> 01:37.333
Mm...

01:39.543 --> 01:42.420
Three so far.

01:42.504 --> 01:44.923
And we're about to skip a fourth.

01:45.007 --> 01:48.510
- All on the Telegraph's dime.
- Hey, I'm a free agent.

01:48.593 --> 01:51.805
Means I'm free to bail on a speech
I've already seen ten thousand times.

01:51.889 --> 01:54.808
You are entitled...

01:57.102 --> 01:58.770
- to nothing.
- Stop.

01:58.854 --> 02:01.606
Let me be clear.
I say, I say...

02:01.690 --> 02:03.400
Come here, boy.

02:03.483 --> 02:05.819
You are entitled...

02:05.903 --> 02:07.321
To nothing!

02:07.404 --> 02:10.657
Now, here's the truth:
The American dream is broken.

02:10.741 --> 02:13.577
And when we are robbed of our dreams,

02:13.660 --> 02:16.163
well, let me ask you, folks,
what are we left with?

02:16.247 --> 02:17.414
Nothing!

02:17.497 --> 02:20.792
And when I asked Congress
to help me take this country

02:20.876 --> 02:26.298
from a welfare state to a fully-employed
nation, what did Congress do?

02:26.382 --> 02:27.507
Nothing!

02:27.591 --> 02:30.552
And when we proved that
America Works actually works,

02:30.635 --> 02:34.932
when we created 50,000 jobs
in Washington DC,

02:35.015 --> 02:37.684
Congress didn't just stop at nothing,

02:37.768 --> 02:41.021
they killed progress in its tracks.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.403
Believe me, I know how you feel.

02:47.485 --> 02:49.363
But we have to remember why we're here.

02:49.445 --> 02:52.741
We have to turn that anger into action.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.369
Ma'am, the Secretary General...

02:55.451 --> 02:58.622
America Works will succeed,
but we need your help.

02:58.705 --> 02:59.915
Hello?

02:59.998 --> 03:04.044
You need to let them know
that a vote for Frank Underwood

03:04.128 --> 03:06.630
is a vote for America Works!

03:09.300 --> 03:13.971
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works!

03:14.763 --> 03:19.810
Now, I had the great pleasure of meeting
a woman this morning named Gloria.

03:19.893 --> 03:23.272
She has a degree
from Iowa State University

03:23.355 --> 03:26.900
and even with her degree,
she can't get employed.

03:26.984 --> 03:30.028
Now, why?
Why is that the case?

03:30.112 --> 03:33.407
Becau... My wife, ladies and gentlemen.

03:41.748 --> 03:45.877
I think what my wife is gently trying
to tell me is that I've run overtime.

03:45.961 --> 03:50.466
She has a very clever nickname for me.

03:50.548 --> 03:51.842
- "Verbosity."
- Yeah.

03:53.344 --> 03:56.180
Now, the main difference
between Claire and me,

03:56.263 --> 03:58.765
aside from her stunning beauty,
of course,

03:58.849 --> 04:01.643
is that she actually knows
what that word means.

04:03.187 --> 04:07.565
Now, look, I would love to stay here all
afternoon and answer all your questions,

04:07.649 --> 04:10.902
but then I'd leave all your friends
in Cedar Rapids waiting for me

04:10.986 --> 04:13.780
even longer than they have
and we don't want to do that.

04:13.864 --> 04:17.284
So I want to thank you all
for coming out to see me today,

04:17.368 --> 04:19.995
to hear about this battle,
this fight we're in.

04:20.077 --> 04:22.122
I want you to caucus for me,

04:22.206 --> 04:26.084
and let's help get Gloria a job!

04:26.168 --> 04:29.505
America Works only if you make it work!

04:29.587 --> 04:33.633
God bless Iowa!
God bless the United States of America!

04:33.717 --> 04:37.554
- Thank you!
- Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

04:38.722 --> 04:41.641
An IED right off Route 90,
three kilometers from the Jordan River.

04:41.725 --> 04:43.310
- When?
- Thirty-six minutes ago.

04:43.394 --> 04:45.915
Russian unit was on patrol.
Two armored vehicles were destroyed.

04:45.979 --> 04:48.065
- All eight troops were killed.
- Who's Cathy spoken to?

04:48.148 --> 04:49.816
Foreign Minister
hasn't returned her call.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.277
We have to make sure the Secretary
General doesn't say anything

04:52.361 --> 04:55.322
until we have a better handle. Remy,
I need to speak to Petrov immediately.

04:55.322 --> 04:57.741
I contacted the Kremlin.
They said he'll reach out soon.

04:57.824 --> 04:59.585
We need the UN
to investigate the blast site.

04:59.617 --> 05:02.178
The Russians have cordoned it off.
They're not letting anyone in.

05:02.246 --> 05:03.663
- Why not?
- We don't know.

05:03.747 --> 05:06.067
We had a unit nearby that
heard the blast, went in to help.

05:06.124 --> 05:08.335
- Russians turned them away.
- I don't like the feel of this.

05:08.419 --> 05:10.579
Cathy says the Israelis want
to send in their own team.

05:10.587 --> 05:13.227
We can't let that happen. The second
Israeli boots hit the ground...

05:13.257 --> 05:15.800
Remy, I don't care what you have to do,
you get Petrov on the phone.

05:15.884 --> 05:17.386
We need to head this off at the pass.

05:17.469 --> 05:19.929
And make sure no one in Congress
overreacts either.

05:20.497 --> 06:54.990
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

06:59.530 --> 07:00.947
How was the game?

07:01.031 --> 07:03.033
Great, until my phone
started blowing up.

07:03.116 --> 07:05.994
Let me see what you have so far.

07:09.373 --> 07:10.582
Um... no.

07:10.666 --> 07:14.252
This is no good.
The language is too obtuse.

07:14.336 --> 07:17.548
- Simpler. More direct.
- Look, here's the deal:

07:17.631 --> 07:20.717
If the Russians don't play ball,
the Israelis will get nervous.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.387
If the Israelis send troops in,
the Palestinians will go apeshit.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.911
If the Palestinians go apeshit,
there could be mortar attacks.

07:25.972 --> 07:28.975
And if there are mortar attacks,
the whole peacekeeping mission

07:29.059 --> 07:31.499
- could go down the drain.
- You want me to actually say that?

07:31.520 --> 07:34.064
God, no.
We need to say the opposite.

07:34.147 --> 07:38.068
Look, make it as clear as the doomsday
scenario that I just described,

07:38.151 --> 07:41.279
but then flip it around
and put a happy face on it.

07:43.198 --> 07:44.949
We can reschedule
everything else,

07:45.033 --> 07:48.161
- but I'm concerned about Harlan Traub.
- The IDP Chairman.

07:48.245 --> 07:50.581
And President
of the Food Processors Association.

07:50.664 --> 07:53.250
He's big for us statewide. We were
supposed to meet with him tonight.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.168
Well, this is a national
security emergency.

07:55.252 --> 07:56.628
He hasn't met with Dunbar yet.

07:56.712 --> 07:58.392
If we cancel,
she gets a clean shot at him.

07:58.422 --> 08:00.674
- All right, so put him on the plane.
- FEC rules.

08:00.757 --> 08:03.801
Campaigning on Air Force One
costs 179,000 an hour.

08:03.885 --> 08:06.012
- Aside from the message it sends...
- So I won't campaign.

08:06.096 --> 08:08.515
I won't have time anyway.
Uh, just make him feel special.

08:08.599 --> 08:10.434
Give him some face time in Washington.

08:10.517 --> 08:11.518
Anything?

08:11.602 --> 08:13.853
Moryakov's office
is giving me the runaround.

08:13.937 --> 08:16.231
An IED
has killed eight Russian troops

08:16.314 --> 08:17.691
on patrol in the Jordan Valley.

08:17.774 --> 08:20.611
So far, no one has claimed
responsibility for this attack.

08:20.694 --> 08:23.572
The only reaction from the Kremlin,
a brief written statement

08:23.655 --> 08:26.283
from Foreign Minister Bugayev
that reads, quote,

08:26.366 --> 08:30.245
"The perpetrators will be found
and brought to justice." End quote.

08:30.328 --> 08:33.331
- Wheels up in 20 minutes.
- I gotta grab my bags from my room.

08:33.414 --> 08:35.917
- Okay. Meet me out front.
- We should take separate cars.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.081
A cab won't even get here
before the plane takes off.

08:38.128 --> 08:40.087
You're coming with me.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.506
Yes, sir.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.424
Not a good day to play hooky.

08:43.508 --> 08:46.303
It's gonna be a late night here.

08:46.386 --> 08:49.847
It depends what Petrov does.
So far, just incredibly loud silence.

08:49.931 --> 08:53.351
I gotta go, hon. Foreign Affairs
is holding an emergency session.

08:54.311 --> 08:55.562
I love you, too.

08:57.105 --> 08:59.274
- I don't have much time.
- Neither do I.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.777
Talking points.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.867
These make me uncomfortable.

09:09.951 --> 09:12.579
Even in a closed session,
whatever I say will get out.

09:12.663 --> 09:14.914
- I'll take hits in Iowa.
- You can't criticize the mission.

09:14.998 --> 09:16.358
We need you to keep everyone calm.

09:16.416 --> 09:18.835
You know how I feel about
unnecessary military involvement.

09:18.918 --> 09:21.638
You asked to be on the ticket, Jackie.
It's been non-stop resistance.

09:21.672 --> 09:23.353
If you don't want
to support the president,

09:23.423 --> 09:26.176
you shouldn't want to be his number two.
I'm sick of pulling teeth.

09:27.344 --> 09:31.181
You're right. I'll do what I can.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.266
Jackie...

09:38.563 --> 09:39.981
I didn't mean to snap.

09:41.775 --> 09:45.529
I know it's hard having a presence here
and campaigning at the same time.

09:46.446 --> 09:48.573
I'm sure it's tough on Alan
and the kids, too.

09:48.657 --> 09:50.701
Alan's been a big help, actually.

09:53.662 --> 09:57.374
I'm glad he's stepping up,
giving you the support you need.

09:57.457 --> 10:00.377
I thought I would hate it,
the whole marriage thing.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.045
But it's nice.

10:03.338 --> 10:06.924
When I can get home,
everyone around the table.

10:09.010 --> 10:10.804
I even cook sometimes.

10:10.887 --> 10:13.890
- Badly, but they indulge me.
- No.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.601
- I have my June Cleaver moments.
- Apron and all?

10:16.685 --> 10:18.061
Don't push it.

10:23.191 --> 10:25.777
I can't remember the last time
I had a home-cooked meal.

10:29.698 --> 10:32.283
- Session's about to start.
- Yeah.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.077
I'll fill you in after.

10:42.544 --> 10:43.545
Tom.

10:47.591 --> 10:49.952
- Where have you been all day?
- Sorry. Working on the book.

10:50.009 --> 10:52.209
I know we were supposed to have
an opportunity to speak,

10:52.262 --> 10:54.347
- but obviously now, it's...
- Of course.

10:54.431 --> 10:56.511
Listen, you can come up
and sit up front if you like.

10:56.558 --> 10:59.603
- I spoke to Claire about it.
- I'm fine back here. Thanks.

10:59.686 --> 11:01.062
Okay.

11:21.499 --> 11:25.002
I need to know this passport lock
is being lifted.

11:25.086 --> 11:29.257
- Show me what you got.
- I'm tired of being strung along.

11:29.340 --> 11:34.262
- You have a location?
- Yeah. But I want a timeline.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.097
- Week or two.
- No.

11:36.180 --> 11:37.891
They've stopped giving me
new assignments.

11:37.973 --> 11:39.694
That means they're getting ready
to fuck me.

11:39.768 --> 11:41.436
It has to happen sooner than that.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.357
What are you doing?

11:48.443 --> 11:50.487
E-mailing a friend in Homeland.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.530
He always gets back to me quickly.

11:55.742 --> 11:57.619
You satisfied?

12:20.266 --> 12:21.309
Rachel.

12:23.186 --> 12:25.104
- It says Jane Doe.
- No, it's her.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.065
It's her.

12:29.317 --> 12:32.027
She ghosted the identity of a girl
named Rebecca Sands.

12:32.111 --> 12:34.405
The birthday's pretty close.

12:34.489 --> 12:38.284
It's August 1990, then she died
in '93, along with her whole family.

12:38.368 --> 12:40.620
But her social went active
about six months ago.

12:40.704 --> 12:44.499
But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands.
It says Jane Doe.

12:44.582 --> 12:46.918
State troopers
found her body in a ditch,

12:47.002 --> 12:50.922
in an abandoned construction site
outside of Tucson.

12:51.006 --> 12:54.926
I mean, there's no...
There's no picture.

12:55.010 --> 12:57.762
There's no proof of anything.

13:15.112 --> 13:17.615
"And do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God

13:17.699 --> 13:20.577
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

13:20.660 --> 13:24.622
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger

13:24.706 --> 13:28.960
and clamor and evil speaking
be put away from you."

13:42.057 --> 13:43.600
No.

13:45.643 --> 13:50.023
- No, no. That's not her.
- Come on, man. There's fingerprints.

13:50.105 --> 13:52.609
Fingerprints from the Tale of Two Cities
book that you gave me.

13:52.692 --> 13:54.819
I ran it against the autopsy report.

13:57.655 --> 14:00.491
It was a ten-point match with Jane Doe.

14:07.707 --> 14:10.251
I need the passport lock lifted now.

14:13.838 --> 14:14.923
- Uh!
- Oh!

14:15.590 --> 14:17.070
- I'm on it.
- When will you be on it?

14:17.133 --> 14:18.509
- Soon.
- Soon? How soon?

14:18.593 --> 14:20.386
As soon as I can!

14:25.391 --> 14:28.311
I did my part.
Get the lock lifted.

14:52.627 --> 14:56.255
You've reached Seth Grayson.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

14:58.215 --> 15:00.677
I need to see him.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.637
My mother died.

15:24.617 --> 15:26.786
Come on!

15:27.537 --> 15:28.997
Hey!

15:31.207 --> 15:32.458
Are you okay?

15:33.668 --> 15:35.211
Hey, man. What the fuck?

15:37.964 --> 15:39.507
Sorry.

15:39.590 --> 15:42.343
You believe this guy?
You want to say it to her, shithead?

15:42.426 --> 15:44.261
Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

15:44.345 --> 15:46.681
- Drinks on me.
- We don't want drinks, shithead.

15:46.764 --> 15:49.266
You need to get out of here.
Tommy, this guy's trashed.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.603
Here. Drinks on me.

15:52.687 --> 15:55.065
No, no. We don't want drinks.
We want you to leave.

15:55.148 --> 15:56.983
Come on. Just take it.
I said I was sorry.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.818
- I don't give a shit.
- Take it.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.946
No, he's apologizing.
I'm telling you.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.073
Sorry.

16:03.156 --> 16:05.992
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- I will bust your fucking face!

16:06.076 --> 16:08.161
- Calm down. Let me get you a cab.
- Okay.

16:11.915 --> 16:16.586
Hello, everyone.
I'm afraid I don't have much news.

16:16.669 --> 16:20.256
We are in touch, uh, with the Russians,
but there's very few details.

16:20.339 --> 16:22.258
I'm waiting to speak
with President Petrov.

16:22.341 --> 16:25.344
- Any reason for the delay?
- He just lost eight soldiers.

16:25.428 --> 16:28.014
Talking to their families
is his priority as it would be mine.

16:28.098 --> 16:30.558
Think this could jeopardize
the peacekeeping mission?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.685
Well, every country
that contributed troops

16:32.769 --> 16:35.271
knew that something
like this was a possibility.

16:35.354 --> 16:38.566
But the Russians fought this plan hard.
This gives Petrov the perfect out.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.569
I wouldn't presume to know
what President Petrov is thinking.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.821
I'll know more once we have
a chance to speak.

16:43.905 --> 16:46.657
What about Congress?
They weren't fans of this mission.

16:46.741 --> 16:49.619
I'm gonna consult with Congressional
leadership as soon as we get back.

16:49.702 --> 16:52.705
In the meantime, my focus is to help
the Russians in any way that I can.

16:52.789 --> 16:55.332
How can you help them when they won't
let anyone near the blast site?

16:55.416 --> 16:56.918
Well, that hasn't been confirmed.

16:57.001 --> 17:00.588
Unless, of course, you have better
intelligence than the Pentagon.

17:02.257 --> 17:04.092
Thank you all very much.
More soon.

17:17.438 --> 17:21.067
Israel wants to go public,
blame Palestine for the attack.

17:21.151 --> 17:22.358
There's no evidence yet.

17:22.443 --> 17:26.321
Yes, well, the message is that Palestine
should be keeping its people in check.

17:26.405 --> 17:28.531
They've also moved 500 troops
to a staging area

17:28.616 --> 17:33.037
- across the border from Beit She'an.
- Christ. Try the Kremlin again, please.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.836
You try yawning?

17:39.919 --> 17:42.588
That works for you, not for me.

17:42.672 --> 17:44.548
What about some water?
Sometimes that helps.

17:44.632 --> 17:48.052
I don't need water, I need a phone call.

17:48.136 --> 17:51.347
Maybe you should talk to Traub
while you're waiting for that phone call.

17:56.978 --> 17:59.314
- You're not eating?
- I'm not hungry.

17:59.396 --> 18:01.149
I think you don't like to fly.

18:01.232 --> 18:03.567
Holding onto that table
like it's a stripper's tits.

18:03.651 --> 18:05.903
Harlan. I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

18:05.987 --> 18:07.947
Please, don't get up.
How's your lobster?

18:08.031 --> 18:09.740
It tastes like it was caught
this morning.

18:09.824 --> 18:13.536
Well, it was.
Nothing but the best for Air Force One.

18:13.619 --> 18:15.621
Sir, I know you have a million things
on your mind,

18:15.705 --> 18:18.025
but I would just love to talk to you
about how to modernize

18:18.041 --> 18:20.168
the food-processing industry in Iowa.

18:20.251 --> 18:23.713
Please, slit my wrists
with his butter knife.

18:23.796 --> 18:26.632
We can't talk election on the plane,
Harlan. That's an FEC no-no.

18:26.716 --> 18:28.301
This isn't about the campaign.

18:28.384 --> 18:30.887
We're talking about the economy,
not the caucus. Right, Harlan?

18:30.970 --> 18:32.513
That's right.

18:32.596 --> 18:34.891
I'm sure you're aware, sir,
that we lead the states

18:34.974 --> 18:37.018
in corn and soybean production.

18:37.101 --> 18:39.436
It's a good thing,
given the trend towards vegan.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.938
But our food-processing plants...

18:41.022 --> 18:43.691
- Well, the largest industry in Iowa.
- That's correct.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.651
And they're slow on the uptake, sir.

18:45.735 --> 18:47.778
We need federal funding
to help subsidize

18:47.862 --> 18:50.948
- the transition toward healthier...
- Mr. President. Your call from Russia.

18:51.032 --> 18:52.552
Oh. I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

18:52.575 --> 18:55.370
But Harlan, we'll get into it,
I promise.

18:55.452 --> 18:58.789
Viktor, it's a terrible tragedy,
Mr. President.

18:58.873 --> 19:00.291
I feel for your loss.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.086
This is why your people
were so persistent?

19:03.169 --> 19:05.796
So you could offer your sympathy? Hm?

19:05.880 --> 19:08.341
It's important that we talk.

19:08.424 --> 19:10.718
You're not letting anyone
near the blast site.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.970
We're conducting our investigation.

19:13.054 --> 19:15.932
Well, is there anything wrong
with allowing UN investigators

19:16.015 --> 19:17.767
to work in conjunction with your people?

19:17.850 --> 19:20.477
UN Command sent my men on that patrol,

19:20.561 --> 19:23.439
the most dangerous stretch
of Route 90 in the entire valley.

19:23.522 --> 19:26.943
- And you sent my men.
- Me? What are you talking about?

19:27.026 --> 19:29.195
You saw my men as expendable.

19:30.405 --> 19:33.366
Viktor, I don't personally oversee
the peacekeeping forces,

19:33.449 --> 19:36.452
and you can't possibly think that
there was some deliberate attempt

19:36.535 --> 19:39.455
- to put your men in harm's way.
- So I am to believe, what?

19:39.538 --> 19:42.959
That this was a random
act of fate, yes?

19:43.042 --> 19:47.422
Listen, whoever's responsible, we can't
let them foment distrust between us.

19:47.504 --> 19:49.465
If we do, then they win.

19:49.548 --> 19:52.927
Let's show them that an incident
like this makes us stronger.

19:53.010 --> 19:55.054
Let us help you find out who did this.

19:55.138 --> 19:57.723
Russians are dead.
Russia will find the killers.

19:57.807 --> 20:00.226
I don't understand
why you're refusing our assistance.

20:00.310 --> 20:01.852
Because we don't need it.

20:01.936 --> 20:04.480
Well, can we at least
keep the dialogue open?

20:04.563 --> 20:07.275
Consult with each other
before you make any move?

20:07.358 --> 20:11.154
I'm going to do what I must,
Mr. President.

20:12.655 --> 20:14.573
Viktor, please listen to me.
We have...

20:14.657 --> 20:17.910
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the line has been disconnected.

20:20.371 --> 20:22.290
He hung up on me.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.631
Cathy Durant, please.

20:32.549 --> 20:34.010
Baldwin was right.

20:34.093 --> 20:36.762
Those eight bodies give Petrov options.

20:36.846 --> 20:40.266
He's not shedding tears,
he's popping champagne corks.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.226
I can hear them.

20:54.822 --> 20:58.117
Not here. Sir.
Restroom's this way.

21:00.203 --> 21:03.247
Who was that?
The guy who just came in?

21:03.331 --> 21:05.124
Didn't see him.

23:22.803 --> 23:25.306
I would've come to your office.

23:25.389 --> 23:28.142
This is the only room
at the UN we don't monitor.

23:28.225 --> 23:31.937
- I'm assuming you don't either.
- No, we haven't bugged it.

23:32.938 --> 23:36.900
- So we can speak openly.
- I think we should.

23:39.487 --> 23:42.697
You talk. I'll listen.

23:45.660 --> 23:49.664
Palestine says it can't control Hamas
if Israeli troops cross into the valley.

23:51.541 --> 23:55.545
We have to back channel this, Alexi.
Petrov won't listen to Francis.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.762
Alexi, please. This whole thing,
you can't let it devolve

24:05.846 --> 24:08.015
into something nobody can control.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.893
Well, maybe that was the objective.

24:12.562 --> 24:14.063
What was?

24:15.690 --> 24:19.652
The president...
never wanted the peacekeeping mission.

24:19.734 --> 24:23.113
You said "objective." Are you telling me
this was somehow planned?

24:23.197 --> 24:27.742
- I haven't said anything.
- But you want to.

24:27.826 --> 24:31.038
The whole world wants to know
who is responsible.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.999
Your troops won't let anyone
near the blast site.

24:39.630 --> 24:42.258
Because they don't want
the world to know.

24:42.341 --> 24:45.094
My brother... he's in the FSB.

24:46.387 --> 24:48.972
We spoke a week ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

24:49.973 --> 24:52.184
Are you absolutely certain about this?

24:55.938 --> 24:57.940
Alexi, go public.

25:00.192 --> 25:02.236
We'll protect you.

25:02.319 --> 25:03.862
Like you did Xander Feng?

25:05.489 --> 25:07.575
That was different.

25:08.492 --> 25:10.244
I have a family.

25:12.538 --> 25:15.291
The FSB has conducted
these sorts of operations before.

25:15.374 --> 25:17.167
The apartment complex that blew up,

25:17.251 --> 25:20.045
Petrov used that
to justify invading Chechnya.

25:20.129 --> 25:22.214
The opera house that was gassed,

25:22.298 --> 25:24.592
he removed all provincial
governors after that.

25:24.675 --> 25:27.303
We do believe the FSB
participated in the first.

25:27.386 --> 25:29.639
We're still uncertain
about the opera house.

25:29.722 --> 25:33.976
But blowing up his own soldiers,
I find that very difficult to believe.

25:34.059 --> 25:37.854
Did he tell you point blank?
Did he say the words?

25:39.356 --> 25:41.233
He said as much as he could.

25:41.317 --> 25:43.944
But the implication was crystal clear.

25:44.027 --> 25:45.820
I'm sure he was very convincing.

25:45.904 --> 25:48.783
All Russian diplomats go through
FSB counter-intel training.

25:48.865 --> 25:51.661
They're trying to provoke
some sort of reaction out of us.

25:51.744 --> 25:53.162
But what about his brother?

25:53.245 --> 25:55.539
It is true that his brother
works for the FSB,

25:55.623 --> 25:57.500
and that we lost track
of him last week.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.461
- That part of the story holds up.
- What's our profile on Moryakov?

26:00.544 --> 26:03.297
We have our agent who's been
assigned to him, sir. Jim?

26:03.380 --> 26:06.883
Moryakov has been considered
a bit of a wild card in Moscow.

26:06.967 --> 26:08.843
Petrov considered recalling him twice,

26:08.927 --> 26:11.681
but held off because
his father's a family friend.

26:11.764 --> 26:14.057
Now, we picked up some chatter
in recent months,

26:14.141 --> 26:18.187
his misgivings with how the Kremlin's
been handling the Jordan Valley.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.731
But does he strike you as a traitor?

26:20.815 --> 26:23.609
He's a complicated man.
Fiercely nationalistic.

26:23.693 --> 26:26.403
But he definitely
has doubts about Petrov.

26:30.616 --> 26:32.867
Shouldn't we at least
entertain the possibility?

26:32.951 --> 26:35.912
Yeah, but how can we determine it
one way or the other? Definitively?

26:35.996 --> 26:37.748
Our satellites aren't enough.

26:37.832 --> 26:42.002
We'd have to get men to the blast site,
retrieve soil samples and blast debris.

26:43.462 --> 26:45.548
How soon could we get a team in?

26:45.631 --> 26:47.257
I'd estimate 72 hours.

26:47.341 --> 26:49.593
Well, three days seems
an awfully long time.

26:49.677 --> 26:52.137
Don't we already have the basics
in place for deployment?

26:52.221 --> 26:54.473
That doesn't take into account
the Russian forces.

26:54.557 --> 26:56.266
We'd want better intel before deploying.

27:00.437 --> 27:03.148
Am I correct in assuming
that every hour that passes,

27:03.232 --> 27:06.861
our chances of retrieving
any proof diminish?

27:06.943 --> 27:08.404
That is correct, sir.

27:08.487 --> 27:10.947
What's the absolute soonest
you can deploy?

27:12.408 --> 27:15.994
Twelve hours, Mr. President. But that
would involve an extremely high degree...

27:16.078 --> 27:18.913
Yeah, I'm aware of the risk, Admiral.

27:18.997 --> 27:20.666
What are the odds of success?

27:21.876 --> 27:25.212
Honestly, sir,
without proper intelligence,

27:25.295 --> 27:27.172
I can't say better than 50/50.

27:29.508 --> 27:31.719
You're certain?

27:31.802 --> 27:34.179
Yes, I am.

27:37.725 --> 27:39.727
Let's put it in motion.

27:41.854 --> 27:44.231
- Mr. President?
- Mark.

27:44.314 --> 27:47.443
Shouldn't the UN be conducting the
investigation instead of the Russians?

27:47.526 --> 27:50.780
The Russians have been our partners in
this mission from day one of deployment,

27:50.863 --> 27:53.783
so I would say that they're conducting
their own investigation

27:53.866 --> 27:57.745
on behalf of the United Nations,
not instead of.

27:57.828 --> 27:59.747
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

27:59.830 --> 28:02.875
Is it correct to say that they are
in no way reporting to UN Command?

28:02.957 --> 28:05.586
In peacekeeping missions,
nations volunteer their forces.

28:05.669 --> 28:07.922
They answer to their own
governments first and foremost,

28:08.004 --> 28:11.383
then they cooperate with the UN Command.
That's an important distinction to make.

28:11.467 --> 28:14.136
Now, any other questions
with respect to the Jordan Valley

28:14.219 --> 28:15.930
should be directed
to the State Department.

28:16.012 --> 28:18.808
But if any of you have questions
that don't relate to yesterday's events,

28:18.891 --> 28:21.017
I'll take one or two.
Yeah, Stephanie.

28:21.101 --> 28:23.479
Mr. President,
Kate and I both had a question.

28:23.562 --> 28:24.772
Thank you, Stephanie.

28:24.855 --> 28:27.608
Mr. President, are you aware, sir,
that campaigning on Air Force One

28:27.691 --> 28:30.527
- is a violation of FEC rules?
- Yes, in general, I am.

28:30.611 --> 28:33.739
Harlan Traub was on the plane yesterday.
It's hard to imagine he was there

28:33.823 --> 28:36.303
for any other reason than you'd be
seeking his support in Iowa.

28:36.366 --> 28:39.369
You don't know how long I've known him,
and yes, he was on the plane yesterday.

28:39.453 --> 28:42.372
But it's not a violation
if you don't campaign, which I didn't.

28:42.456 --> 28:45.793
I think the extent of our conversation
was asking him how he liked his meal.

28:45.876 --> 28:48.044
But I'm happy to let the FEC decide.

28:48.128 --> 28:51.340
Now, does anybody else have any question
that somebody else asked them to ask me?

28:52.508 --> 28:53.759
Where's Traub now?

28:53.843 --> 28:55.803
At the Hay-Adams.
Should be here in an hour.

28:55.886 --> 28:57.930
It'd be bad if anyone saw him
at the White House.

28:58.013 --> 28:59.640
Well, I don't even
want him in DC now.

28:59.723 --> 29:01.976
The last thing we need
is some bullshit FEC story

29:02.058 --> 29:03.738
while I'm trying to deal
with the Russians.

29:03.811 --> 29:05.604
Let's get him back to Iowa.
And you handle this.

29:05.688 --> 29:07.606
You have better people skills
than Vaughn.

29:07.690 --> 29:11.234
And you talk to Baldwin. You make it
crystal clear we violated no regulations.

29:11.318 --> 29:14.571
Sir? I got a voicemail
from Doug last night.

29:14.655 --> 29:17.950
- He said his mom died.
- My God, that's awful.

29:19.034 --> 29:21.370
Except Julia Stamper
passed away ten years ago.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.163
I know, I was at the funeral.

29:23.246 --> 29:25.916
Send some flowers.
Actually, get Doug in here.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.251
I'd like to give my condolences
in person.

29:30.838 --> 29:33.883
There's a whole host of ways we can
revolutionize food processing in Iowa

29:33.966 --> 29:36.218
through America Works.
The subsidies you want for R and D

29:36.301 --> 29:38.804
- can be financed as a jobs...
- You don't have to do this.

29:38.888 --> 29:40.472
- Do what?
- Sweet talk me.

29:40.556 --> 29:42.975
And a cab would've been fine.

29:44.309 --> 29:47.354
I wanted to drive you myself so we had
a chance to talk about your concerns.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.941
Well, I'm used to talking to candidates,
not chauffeurs.

29:54.152 --> 29:57.155
- I'm not a chauffeur.
- Hm?

29:57.239 --> 29:59.408
Well, it's your hands on the wheel.

30:32.357 --> 30:33.734
Seth?

31:03.430 --> 31:06.642
- Shit.
- Registration and insurance, please.

31:06.725 --> 31:09.227
I'm sorry, officer.
I left my wallet at work.

31:09.311 --> 31:11.146
Registration? Proof of insurance?

31:11.229 --> 31:13.816
- In my wallet.
- You're supposed to keep it in the car.

31:13.899 --> 31:16.944
Yeah. But if someone steals
your car, why give 'em the paperwork?

31:17.027 --> 31:20.238
All right, I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for a moment, please.

31:21.406 --> 31:24.451
Officer, my name is Remy Danton.
I'm Chief of Staff to the president.

31:24.534 --> 31:27.579
Without your identification, sir,
I don't know who you are.

31:27.663 --> 31:30.248
- Got my government pin.
- That doesn't matter, sir.

31:30.332 --> 31:33.293
I still need to see your identification.
Would you step out of the car, please?

31:33.376 --> 31:36.171
Officer, you run a search on Remy Danton,
you'll get my photo.

31:36.254 --> 31:39.091
Sir, I asked you to step out of the car.
Please.

31:45.097 --> 31:47.516
- Any weapons on you?
- Of course not.

31:47.599 --> 31:50.352
All right. You mind stepping
to the rear of the vehicle, please?

31:53.188 --> 31:55.107
I'm gonna pat you down,
just to make sure.

31:57.526 --> 31:59.444
Feet back.

31:59.528 --> 32:03.115
Car comes back to a Virginia
corporation, no address.

32:03.198 --> 32:05.784
I'm cleared Top Secret,
my information is masked.

32:05.868 --> 32:08.203
Sir, I need you to stay here
for a moment, please.

32:10.998 --> 32:12.708
- What do you got?
- No address on file.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.710
- Why'd you stop me?
- One moment, sir.

32:14.793 --> 32:17.379
No, not one moment. I got the right
to know why you stopped me.

32:17.462 --> 32:19.303
Sir, I asked you to keep
your hands on the car.

32:19.381 --> 32:22.384
I'm gonna need your badge number. Trying
to show off for your partner, brother?

32:22.467 --> 32:24.427
I'm not your brother.
Don't make us restrain you.

32:24.511 --> 32:25.971
- Officer Davis.
- Sir.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.389
Officer Corchoran.

32:27.472 --> 32:29.599
Know what? I'm gonna take a photo.

32:30.433 --> 32:31.977
What the fuck?!

32:33.187 --> 32:35.856
- What's your problem?!
- Calm down!

32:35.939 --> 32:38.025
Sir!

32:38.108 --> 32:39.526
I'm gonna need your badge number!

32:47.910 --> 32:50.620
Mr. Danton, I'm Lieutenant Hixson.

32:50.704 --> 32:53.165
I'm very sorry
for this misunderstanding.

32:53.248 --> 32:54.708
Watch your head.

32:56.835 --> 32:59.588
I hope you accept my apology
on their behalf.

33:00.422 --> 33:03.299
- They said I was stopped for speeding.
- Yes.

33:03.383 --> 33:05.928
When they encounter someone
without a license and registration...

33:06.011 --> 33:07.262
Write up the ticket.

33:07.345 --> 33:09.666
You don't have to worry about that, sir.
You're free to go.

33:09.681 --> 33:11.558
If I was speeding,
give me the damn ticket.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.853
That's really not necessary
after everything we put you through.

33:14.937 --> 33:16.479
Lieutenant.

33:24.613 --> 33:27.574
Hey. I'd invite you up,
but the kids, they're...

33:27.657 --> 33:31.078
We're bringing them to Iowa
this trip and it's a total shit-show.

33:31.161 --> 33:33.789
I didn't come here to talk to you
about the campaign.

33:33.872 --> 33:37.500
I probably... you know, I shouldn't
have just shown up like this, but...

33:37.584 --> 33:39.628
Here. Come this way.

33:42.172 --> 33:44.633
It's stupid.
I don't even know why I came over.

33:44.716 --> 33:46.676
Did something happen?

33:46.760 --> 33:50.222
I got pulled over. For speeding.

33:50.305 --> 33:54.059
Things got out of hand.
A nigger in a nice car.

33:54.143 --> 33:56.519
Jesus.

33:57.813 --> 33:58.981
I left my wallet at work.

33:59.064 --> 34:02.151
When I tried to tell the guy who I was,
he didn't believe me, so...

34:03.568 --> 34:05.403
I don't know.

34:05.487 --> 34:07.156
I didn't believe me.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.534
There I was with my hands
in cuffs and it was like, uh...

34:14.913 --> 34:17.040
It was like I was outside of myself.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.168
I could've been anyone.

34:20.252 --> 34:21.585
I wasn't me.

34:25.924 --> 34:28.551
- Does that make any sense?
- You got rattled.

34:28.635 --> 34:31.304
No, it's not that.

34:31.387 --> 34:34.641
I look at you and Alan,
and even Frank and Claire.

34:34.724 --> 34:38.103
This happened and I didn't have
anyone to tell about it.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.438
You have me, right?

34:42.815 --> 34:44.275
I'm glad you came over.

34:45.568 --> 34:49.989
It's not fair.
Intruding on you like this.

34:50.072 --> 34:53.034
If I thought you were intruding,
I wouldn't have come downstairs.

35:08.758 --> 35:11.469
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:11.553 --> 35:12.554
I...

35:13.555 --> 35:15.473
You still mean a lot to me.

35:15.557 --> 35:18.060
I am there for you, as your friend.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.814
You should go back up. Finish packing.

35:23.732 --> 35:25.525
Safe flight.

35:28.570 --> 35:32.782
We're set to insert at 2100 EST,
0400 local time.

35:32.866 --> 35:35.327
We'll use a Fulton recovery
of any material samples.

35:35.410 --> 35:36.619
The extraction?

35:36.703 --> 35:40.498
The team will make its way on foot
to this rendezvous point for extract.

35:40.582 --> 35:42.222
How are they gonna pass
the Russian lines?

35:42.292 --> 35:44.836
Our intel is spotty at best,
but our team is scheduled

35:44.920 --> 35:48.048
to link up with a local agent
who will assist.

35:48.131 --> 35:51.176
Let's move this down to the Situation
Room. I'll be there in a few minutes.

35:51.260 --> 35:52.844
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

35:56.639 --> 35:58.058
Did he say anything?

35:58.141 --> 36:00.560
He wouldn't even look at me
when I said hello.

36:00.643 --> 36:01.978
Send him in.

36:08.277 --> 36:09.611
Doug.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.272
Are you certain?

37:34.779 --> 37:37.699
Who gathered all this inform...
Oh, never mind. I shouldn't know.

37:39.701 --> 37:42.412
Was it you... who...?

37:43.205 --> 37:44.789
No.

37:47.959 --> 37:51.046
You shouldn't have brought this here.

37:51.129 --> 37:52.964
I wanted you to see it.

37:54.257 --> 37:56.218
So you would believe me.

37:57.802 --> 37:59.346
Brutal.

38:01.639 --> 38:03.892
I'm drunk, sir.

38:06.728 --> 38:08.980
I'm... I'm drunk right now.

38:15.653 --> 38:17.906
This girl really meant something to you,
didn't she?

38:17.989 --> 38:19.282
Yeah.

38:21.076 --> 38:22.577
She did.

38:26.622 --> 38:28.458
I've been working for Dunbar.

38:35.298 --> 38:38.051
I pushed myself too much.
It's my fault.

38:41.054 --> 38:44.140
It was for you.
To see how close I could get.

38:44.224 --> 38:47.185
If I could find something,
a silver bullet.

38:49.521 --> 38:52.815
To prove that...
I was still useful.

39:00.865 --> 39:02.534
How can I help you, Doug?

39:02.617 --> 39:05.036
I can't go to rehab.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.456
- Just not another hospital, or...
- Okay.

39:07.539 --> 39:10.292
I just... I can't... I can't do it.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.336
We'll figure something out.

39:15.589 --> 39:17.715
I'm not Peter Russo.

39:19.301 --> 39:21.677
I won't go like he did.

39:29.144 --> 39:32.522
No, you won't.
You're going to get better, Doug.

39:34.274 --> 39:36.401
I promise you that.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.369
Yes, send Meechum in here.

40:05.221 --> 40:08.183
There's an envelope on my desk.
I need it to be incinerated.

40:08.266 --> 40:09.643
Yes, sir.

40:14.314 --> 40:16.816
And then I need you to take Doug home.

40:20.236 --> 40:22.113
Come on, Doug, it's time to go.

40:35.126 --> 40:36.794
This way, Mr. Stamper.

40:39.839 --> 40:42.091
You stay with him
until we figure out what's next.

40:42.175 --> 40:43.510
Yes, sir.

40:53.645 --> 40:55.522
Some privacy, please.

40:57.566 --> 41:00.360
- This is Heather Dunbar.
- I'll connect you momentarily.

41:01.903 --> 41:03.530
Heather?

41:03.613 --> 41:04.906
Mr. President?

41:04.989 --> 41:08.284
Doug Stamper is my friend,
and you came very close to killing him.

41:08.368 --> 41:11.120
- Excuse me?
- You're aware he's an alcoholic?

41:11.204 --> 41:13.707
- Yes.
- And how serious his injuries were.

41:13.789 --> 41:17.377
- Mr. President...
- But you still put him to work.

41:17.460 --> 41:21.381
A man who's trying to recover,
who's trying to get back his life.

41:21.464 --> 41:23.717
Did you honestly think
that he could handle that?

41:23.799 --> 41:25.093
Douglas came to us.

41:25.176 --> 41:30.098
And you should've turned him away
if you had one ounce of decency.

41:31.558 --> 41:33.226
What's happened?
Is he okay?

41:33.309 --> 41:36.104
You don't have the right
to ask me that question.

41:36.187 --> 41:38.732
And if you do anything
that endangers his health again,

41:38.814 --> 41:44.904
I swear to God,
I will put you in your fucking grave.

41:58.793 --> 42:01.087
Let's continue.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.759
Thirty-two thousand feet,
one minute to insert.

42:05.841 --> 42:07.969
Let's hear comms.

42:08.052 --> 42:09.721
Audio on.

42:09.804 --> 42:11.765
Stand up!

42:12.641 --> 42:14.476
Twenty seconds. Last checks.

42:16.394 --> 42:18.187
Last checks! Gather round.

42:26.821 --> 42:30.784
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven,

42:30.866 --> 42:33.328
six, five, four,

42:33.411 --> 42:36.872
three, two. Green light.

42:36.956 --> 42:40.585
- Video will go dark once they jump.
- Go. Go.

42:49.093 --> 42:51.137
Chutes deployed.

42:52.305 --> 42:53.723
The rally point.

42:53.807 --> 42:56.726
Link-up with indig agent happens here,

42:56.810 --> 42:58.394
half a klick from the drop zone.

42:58.478 --> 43:00.689
He'll arrange safe passage
to the blast site.

43:15.411 --> 43:17.497
Motherfucker!

43:18.164 --> 43:20.916
Agent is rogue.
Repeat, we have a bad agent.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.252
- We've been compromised.
- Man down! Man down!

43:23.336 --> 43:24.546
- Fuck.
- Over there!

43:24.629 --> 43:26.964
- Agent is kilo.
- Get pressure on that wound.

43:27.716 --> 43:29.384
We should abort, sir.

43:29.467 --> 43:31.636
- Mr. President.
- Shut it down. Bring them home.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.388
"Match Stick," I repeat, "Match Stick."

43:33.471 --> 43:36.098
Head directly to waypoint X-ray.
How copy, over?

43:36.182 --> 43:37.851
Proceeding to X-ray.

43:49.445 --> 43:51.947
- Hello?
- He's in the bedroom.

44:06.212 --> 44:07.881
Hey, brother.

44:31.237 --> 44:32.947
Say again. Over.

44:35.450 --> 44:36.785
Confirmed, sir.

44:36.868 --> 44:41.289
The element is off the X and moving
to extract. Three wounded, one KIA.

44:42.582 --> 44:44.417
I'll need the name, next of kin.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.959
Yes, sir.

45:16.031 --> 45:17.450
Yes?

45:18.618 --> 45:21.370
Sir, President Petrov
is on the line.

45:21.454 --> 45:23.873
I'll take it in here.
Shut the door, please.

45:26.876 --> 45:29.420
- Viktor.
- We know it was your men.

45:29.504 --> 45:31.004
What was?

45:31.088 --> 45:33.215
Did you think we wouldn't detect you?

45:33.299 --> 45:36.051
Whatever you're accusing us of,
I don't know anything about it.

45:36.135 --> 45:38.972
Oh, yes, you do.
And so do the Israelis.

45:39.054 --> 45:41.140
We leaked footage
of the firefight to them.

45:42.684 --> 45:44.310
I can't imagine they'd be pleased

45:44.393 --> 45:48.731
America is conducting covert operations
without consulting with them first.

45:48.815 --> 45:50.900
You killed your own men, Viktor.

45:53.235 --> 45:55.070
It was your man who got shot last night.

45:55.154 --> 45:57.824
I mean the blast. We have the intel.

45:57.907 --> 46:00.827
It was you, not terrorists.
It was FSB.

46:00.910 --> 46:04.663
So you humiliate me in Washington,
humiliate me in Moscow,

46:04.747 --> 46:07.542
and now you insult me
with these ridiculous fantasies.

46:07.625 --> 46:09.711
What do you want
out of all of this, Viktor?

46:09.794 --> 46:13.214
Justice, for my soldiers who died
on a mission you devised.

46:13.297 --> 46:15.424
If anyone is to blame
for their deaths, it's you.

46:15.508 --> 46:16.676
Goodbye, Viktor.

46:19.428 --> 46:21.890
Francis, what did he say?

46:24.726 --> 46:26.602
I have to finish this letter.

46:42.827 --> 46:44.746
Over the last several hours,

46:44.829 --> 46:46.789
Israeli forces entered
the Jordan Valley.

46:46.873 --> 46:50.919
Eyewitness reports say they've taken up
positions near the encampments

46:51.002 --> 46:53.963
where Russian troops are refusing access
to a blast site

46:54.047 --> 46:56.591
where eight of their countrymen
were killed two days ago.

46:56.674 --> 46:59.552
The Israeli Prime Minister
had this to say, quote:

46:59.635 --> 47:01.888
"With both Russian forces
refusing to leave

47:01.971 --> 47:05.016
and the presence of covert operations
from other nations..."

47:05.098 --> 47:07.727
Hamas and Hezbollah
are getting involved.

47:08.603 --> 47:09.604
How?

47:09.687 --> 47:12.648
They've vowed to raise local militias
if the Israelis cross the border.

47:12.732 --> 47:15.818
...nor has the American government
regarding covert operations.

47:15.902 --> 47:19.321
- This is gonna be bad.
- Yeah, it sure is.

47:19.405 --> 47:21.323
I should get to the White House.

47:21.407 --> 47:24.660
- Lock the door on the way out?
- Mm-hm.

47:39.425 --> 47:41.510
The Israelis.

47:41.594 --> 47:44.263
I know,
I've been watching the news all night.

47:44.346 --> 47:46.432
We should get to the Situation Room.

47:46.515 --> 47:48.392
Let me finish this first.
I'll be right down.

47:48.476 --> 47:50.020
All right, I'll see you down there.
