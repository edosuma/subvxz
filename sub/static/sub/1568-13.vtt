WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.169
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.379 --> 00:05.421
It's started.
They're bleeding my friends.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.923
I think I know
how to take Mount Weather.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.174
We just need someone
on the inside.

00:08.384 --> 00:09.384
Bellamy?

00:09.593 --> 00:10.802
They're already
using their blood,

00:11.011 --> 00:12.720
and things are gonna
get ugly in here real fast.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.138
You're not taking
anyone else

00:14.348 --> 00:15.890
out of this room
without a fight.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.685
No. Hey!

00:18.894 --> 00:21.020
Uh!
Ugh!

00:21.230 --> 00:24.190
Everybody move!
Take the level! Go!

00:24.400 --> 00:26.401
There's a war council meeting
happening tonight,

00:26.610 --> 00:27.944
and all the leaders
are going to be there.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.278
We're gonna
use a missile.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.655
Whitman
to Mount Weather command.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.240
All targets accounted for.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.533
We have to start
evacuating.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.784
If we evacuate,
they'll know we have

00:34.994 --> 00:36.369
a spy inside
their walls.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.871
We slip away
right now.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.623
On your command, sir.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.666
Fire.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.086
We have to leave now.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.216
You knew.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.384
Mom--

00:51.593 --> 00:53.678
please tell me
this wasn't you.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.888
I wish I could.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.234
Clarke.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.988
No. No. Clarke.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.909
I could have
warned them.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.285
I could
have saved them.

01:59.495 --> 02:01.621
If they see us,
they'll strike again.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.248
Clarke...

02:04.458 --> 02:07.585
Victory stands on
the back of sacrifice.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.504
You know that.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.550
I want the
Mountain men dead,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.886
all of them.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.142
Look out!
Let's go here!

02:23.352 --> 02:28.106
Let's go! Come on!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.399
All right.
You're good.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.485
I need bandages!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.153
Right here.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.079
It's no use.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.455
She's still alive.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.583
We save those
who can be saved.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.005
I'm so sorry.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.683
Lincoln, be careful.
It's not stable.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.185
They're down there.
Yaagh!

03:06.395 --> 03:07.937
Do you hear someone?

03:10.941 --> 03:14.652
Abby, I'm sure
Clarke is OK.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.572
We'll find her.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.783
Indra. She's alive.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.081
Oh, Indra.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.835
Raagh!

03:43.015 --> 03:45.183
Oh!

03:45.392 --> 03:48.019
Sniper!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.354
Octavia, go.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.865
The spotter.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.117
He aimed the missile.
He's alone.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.785
Clarke,
just slow down.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.913
If he is a spotter, he's here
to make sure we're dead.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.706
If he tells the Mountain
were alive--

04:08.916 --> 04:09.916
he won't.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.584
How can you
be sure?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.419
Because I'm
gonna kill him.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.010
Agh!

04:21.220 --> 04:22.386
Get down!

04:32.189 --> 04:34.023
Uh!

04:35.442 --> 04:38.736
Lincoln, you must
stop the bleeding.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.946
Uh!

04:40.155 --> 04:42.114
Indra, let me help you.
No.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.868
What do we do?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.453
Whoa! No!

04:47.663 --> 04:48.955
Agh!

04:52.042 --> 04:52.792
We're trapped.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.586
I say we use the
sky girl to draw fire.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.004
You got a problem?
Yes.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.881
You are the bringers
of death.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.932
Uh!

05:08.141 --> 05:10.851
Uh! Uh!

05:14.064 --> 05:15.523
Help.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.275
Someone's alive
down there.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.241
Please,
we need help!

05:40.924 --> 05:43.050
Ah...

06:26.386 --> 06:27.845
All right. Just go ahead
and get rid of yours.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.889
Attack the main line
of you can.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.018
Ooh!

06:37.647 --> 06:39.482
Jasper, where
do you want this?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.150
Put it here,
no weak spots.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.651
We need to make sure
they don't get in.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.570
They won't.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.156
We took the level,
but now we have to hold it.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.950
They will be coming,
and we need to be ready.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.952
Harper, get some pots
from the kitchen,

06:52.162 --> 06:56.123
fill them with water,
as big as you can find, OK?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.333
Watch out.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.252
Good, Fox.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.545
Let's go get those
hallway cameras, all right?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.089
Nope. Leave the
hallway cameras.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.548
We'll need eyes
out there.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.966
You can do that?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.968
Have you met me?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.053
Where are we
on the doors?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.346
Elevators
are all disabled,

07:10.555 --> 07:11.972
and I shorted the other
stairwell locks.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.933
This one is tricky, though.
I can't seem to--

07:16.561 --> 07:18.187
that works, too.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.569
How long you think
we can hold them off?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.155
As long
as we have to.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.085
I've got to get
down there.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.005
Uh!

07:45.215 --> 07:46.590
Now.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.968
Aargh!
Uhh!

07:54.349 --> 07:55.307
Go, go. Come on.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.475
Let's take it!
Come on!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.571
All right, all right.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.072
Gah!

08:11.867 --> 08:13.701
What are we gonna do?
We can't move.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.244
I'm going
for the shooter.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.745
I'll sound the horn
when it's done.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.956
All right, my friend.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.584
I'm going with you.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.918
No. Nyko needs
you here.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.295
Are you sure
you're up to this?

08:35.599 --> 08:39.268
What can I do?
Pressure here.

08:39.478 --> 08:43.606
This is my village.
You're the chief second.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.107
Save our people.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.484
We're pinned down,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.152
and the other seconds
won't follow me.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.280
So make them.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.908
Indra?
Oh...

08:55.952 --> 08:57.036
She's losing
too much blood.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.623
Indra. We have
to do something.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.833
Thanks, sky girl,
but there's nothing to do

09:03.043 --> 09:04.418
until the sniper
is dead.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.276
We are not
ready for this.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.819
Yes, we are.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.280
Just follow the plan,
we'll be OK...

09:34.491 --> 09:36.617
I promise.
OK.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.911
No guns.
You were right.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.455
It's because they
can't kill us,

09:41.665 --> 09:43.249
not like this,
anyway.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.417
Be careful with that thing.
We're in close.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.502
You could hit
one of us.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.836
Wait a second.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.381
Some of them aren't
wearing Hazmat suits.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.007
What's it mean?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.051
Means they're cured.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.553
Marrow treatments
worked.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.223
Get this down.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.266
Get ready.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.350
Get it open!

10:01.560 --> 10:02.768
Let's go.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.611
We got it.
Alpha team, go.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.284
Smoke in.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.746
Cover your mouth. Go.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.957
Take it down.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.919
Go, go, go.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.904
Now!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.373
Yaah!

11:14.674 --> 11:18.844
Retreat! Retreat.
Pull back. Pull back now.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.016
Raah!

11:27.646 --> 11:29.438
We did it!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.067
Seal the barricade!

11:33.276 --> 11:37.488
Jasper!
No! No! Jasper!

11:37.697 --> 11:40.157
Fox! Fox! No! No!

11:40.367 --> 11:43.452
I told her
she'd be OK.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.914
I promised her.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.177
Ungh...

12:03.556 --> 12:05.683
Uh...

12:08.895 --> 12:12.022
Aah! Oh! Uh!

12:33.712 --> 12:37.339
Hold on. I'm coming.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.141
Marcus.

12:49.728 --> 12:53.981
Marcus, it's OK.
I'm here.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.900
Marcus...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.902
It's OK.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.905
Abby.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.074
It's my leg.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.506
You're bleeding,
but not bad.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.550
Can you move
your toes?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.386
Yeah.
Good.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.513
I don't think
anything is broken.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.269
You're lucky.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.646
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.946
Nngh!

13:47.410 --> 13:48.911
Aah!

13:51.831 --> 13:54.082
Not that lucky.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.339
That could be Clarke.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.842
I'm not leaving
you here.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.554
Rrgh!

14:08.681 --> 14:12.768
No! Uh! Uh!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.438
Oh...

14:18.149 --> 14:20.067
I'll prep the table.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.112
Uh! No. No. Uh!

14:29.410 --> 14:30.911
Thanks.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.046
Bellamy...

14:41.256 --> 14:42.339
You OK?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.174
OK. It's all right.
Gonna be OK.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.052
Gonna be OK.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.805
Come on. We have
to get her someplace safe.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.598
You're OK.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.441
Dad, you're home.
Yeah.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.485
The drill bit
broke again.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.242
What are they
doing here?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.410
Look. They're in trouble.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.786
We just need someplace
safe to stay.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.121
They need to go now.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.789
Let me explain.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.417
How about you explain
where he got that uniform?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.044
Maya, you know
how dangerous this is.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.504
What are you doing?

15:22.714 --> 15:25.215
What mom
would've done.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.884
I need you to leave.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.969
Sorry.
We can't do that.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.555
That's OK.
He's gonna help us.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.348
Really? Because
I'm not getting that.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.850
My parents were
part of a movement

15:35.059 --> 15:38.437
that was against using
outsider blood.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.190
My mom refused the treatments,
and it killed her.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.235
She was willing to die
for what she believed in.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.780
Maya, you were 5.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.699
I couldn't
leave you alone.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.951
Not a little
girl anymore.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.621
They were willing
to kill you before.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.080
If you get caught--

15:57.290 --> 15:58.999
we won't
if you help us.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.085
Please.
They're killing us.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.087
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

16:09.761 --> 16:14.014
Just this once,
just for one night.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.436
My room is this way.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.438
Thank you.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.607
You know they'll
never stop, right?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.108
If the rumors are true
and your bone marrow

16:25.318 --> 16:26.902
can get us back
to the ground,

16:27.111 --> 16:29.821
they'll never stop.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.951
It'll be light soon.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.869
We won't have
the darkness to hide us.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.955
Neither will he.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.207
I feel your anger,
Clarke.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.919
Do me a favor--
no more lessons.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.588
You need to focus.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.173
We do what we must
to survive.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.841
The enemy
does the same.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.551
It's not personal.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.387
It is to me.

16:53.596 --> 16:54.721
You think that
killing the shooter

16:54.931 --> 16:56.056
will make you feel
better, but it won't.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.349
The only thing
that will do that

16:57.558 --> 16:58.433
is winning this war.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.519
That's enough.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.405
Is it him?

17:16.995 --> 17:20.122
No.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.332
Lincoln.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.589
Clarke?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.556
Commander, wh...

17:37.765 --> 17:38.807
Octavia
said you were both--

17:39.017 --> 17:41.184
you've seen Octavia?
Yeah.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.311
The few that survived
the explosion

17:43.521 --> 17:45.439
are being pinned down
by a sniper.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.690
That's why I'm here.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.444
Come on. We need to get
to the high ground.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.950
G'uh!

17:58.828 --> 18:00.037
Uh!

18:12.884 --> 18:16.553
Uh! Nngh!

18:16.763 --> 18:18.555
Don't move. Don't move.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.141
Yaagh!

18:21.350 --> 18:23.268
Your femoral artery
is lacerated.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.187
The weight of the beam,

18:25.396 --> 18:28.940
it's the only thing
keeping you alive.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.069
Ha! Hell of a bandage.
Ohh...

18:32.278 --> 18:34.488
I'll figure it out.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.621
Abby, just...

18:45.041 --> 18:46.750
Go find
your daughter.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.752
If I can get a tourniquet
around your leg,

18:48.961 --> 18:50.045
it buys us more time.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.089
Go find Clarke.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.341
She's not here.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.766
She's...Fine.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.977
Lexa, too.

19:09.941 --> 19:14.152
Aah! Aah! Aah!

19:22.286 --> 19:24.454
Lovejoy's key card will
get you into the armory.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.248
The guns are locked, but
the guard has the key.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.290
I can lure him away or--

19:27.500 --> 19:28.750
no. There's no time.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.377
Once I get the guns, how
do I get them to level 5?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.878
They're watching
every door.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.757
Maybe not. The mess hall
has a trash chute.

19:35.967 --> 19:36.883
A trash chute?

19:37.093 --> 19:37.968
There's one
on every level.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.636
Best part--no
radiation alarms.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.971
The hatches
leak like crazy.

19:41.180 --> 19:41.972
So they put in
these airlocks

19:42.181 --> 19:43.265
just to be safe.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.516
You get the guns,

19:44.725 --> 19:46.434
I'll get them
into the mess hall.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.186
You're a natural-born
revolutionary.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.522
My mom was
the revolutionary.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.150
I'm just trying
to do what's right.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.318
Be back here
in 30 minutes.

20:04.162 --> 20:08.582
Maya, we were just
on our way to see you.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.755
How can I help you,
Mr. president?

20:19.594 --> 20:21.636
They're gonna come in
a lot hotter next time.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.221
You know that, right?

20:23.431 --> 20:24.556
All we got to do
is hold the floor

20:24.765 --> 20:25.974
until Bellamy finds
a way out.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.434
We're gonna need more
than a bucket of water

20:27.643 --> 20:29.769
and 4 guns
to do that.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.522
Cage, on radio:
This is president Wallace

20:32.732 --> 20:34.816
talking to the people
who just killed 10 of my men.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.443
Jasper.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.944
I thought
we'd try something

20:38.154 --> 20:40.322
a little different this time.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.783
There's only 20 minutes
of oxygen in Maya's suit.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.952
I know she's a friend of yours.

20:46.162 --> 20:51.499
20 minutes, your friend
will either suffocate or burn...

20:54.295 --> 20:56.338
But you can save her.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.548
All you have to do is surrender.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.936
No! No!

21:18.277 --> 21:19.319
We can't wait anymore.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.280
Our people
are dying down there.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.911
If we can get
to the crater,

21:28.120 --> 21:29.913
we can tunnel in
from the side.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.665
There's no cover.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.710
I'll do it.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.507
Get back. Get back.
Agh!

21:40.716 --> 21:44.010
Any other
bad ideas?

21:51.060 --> 21:54.521
Ahh. Just one.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.023
Unh!

22:03.990 --> 22:04.906
Unh!

22:18.087 --> 22:19.587
Now what,
sky girl?

22:19.797 --> 22:21.172
Now we dig.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.215
Stay down.
Stay down. Stay down.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.551
Move it.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.518
Hey, you're OK.

22:36.731 --> 22:41.151
Listen to me.
Fox is OK.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.278
Bellamy saved her.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.239
He's gonna get some guns
in here through the trash chute.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.783
If we can get guns in,
we can get you out.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.871
No. We can't.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.750
I dismantled the chute.
I'm sorry.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.710
I didn't think we'd be
trying to open it ourselves.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.384
I can fix it.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.220
Thank you.
Go help him.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.722
Harper...

23:14.685 --> 23:18.355
I won't let you die.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.899
I won't let you
surrender.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.785
Uh!

23:33.662 --> 23:35.288
Mm...

23:40.461 --> 23:42.879
Ah...Uh...

23:52.681 --> 23:55.266
Uh! Uh...

23:55.476 --> 23:58.353
Ungh!

24:01.524 --> 24:03.566
Marcus?

24:05.361 --> 24:07.487
Uh!

24:10.825 --> 24:14.411
Marcus, Marcus,
wake up.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.038
Open your eyes.
You have to wake up.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.541
Marcus, open your eyes.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.087
Oh, I'm so cold.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.340
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

24:27.550 --> 24:31.136
I'm OK.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.305
I'm sorry, Marcus.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.477
I'm so sorry.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.108
It's not
your fault, Abby.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.486
It is my fault.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.489
She's my daughter.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.915
What are you
talking about?

25:06.464 --> 25:09.591
She knew.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.843
Clarke escaped...

25:14.221 --> 25:16.723
Before the attack.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.853
She knew
it was coming.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.356
Yes.
Oh...

25:26.650 --> 25:31.321
How could she do
something like this?

25:33.282 --> 25:36.034
Because she grew up
on the ark.

25:38.454 --> 25:42.457
She learned
what to do from us.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.751
She let this happen.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.006
She could've
stopped it.

25:50.216 --> 25:54.052
She made a choice,

25:54.261 --> 25:58.348
like executing people
for stealing

25:58.557 --> 26:02.352
medicine and food...

26:05.064 --> 26:07.565
Like sucking the air

26:07.775 --> 26:14.072
from the lungs
of 300 parents

26:15.199 --> 26:17.033
so they could save
their children.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.087
Like floating
the man you love...

26:31.549 --> 26:34.133
To save your people.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.934
Yes.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.983
We have to answer

26:50.192 --> 26:52.485
for our sins, Abby.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.621
After everything
we've done,

27:03.831 --> 27:07.584
do we even deserve
to survive?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.590
She's almost
out of oxygen.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.008
It's been
19 minutes.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.676
You're not helping,
Harper.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.386
Don't worry. We'll get
it open, won't we, Monty?

27:18.596 --> 27:19.470
Almost there.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.513
Almost isn't
good enough.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.432
I just need
to bypass the--oh!

27:22.641 --> 27:24.100
Screw this.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.435
What the hell
did you do?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.353
Cut the power to the motor.
Help me.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.981
All right.
Uh! Come on.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.818
We can't get leverage.

27:34.028 --> 27:34.944
There's
someone in there.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.155
They're coming in!

27:39.783 --> 27:41.200
Bellamy.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.577
Get her in here.
Come on.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.454
Come on!
Go, go, go!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.039
Hurry up.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.174
Uh!

27:57.384 --> 27:58.718
Uh!

28:00.679 --> 28:02.305
I got you.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.183
Decontamination complete.
All clear.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.322
Dad, what are you
doing here?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.115
What your mother
would have done.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.867
Come here.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.037
Ha ha ha! Uh!

28:27.331 --> 28:29.123
Hey, listen to me.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.583
Clarke is coming
with an army of grounders.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.001
What?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.586
We have to keep all
of you safe until then.

28:33.796 --> 28:34.712
And don't tell me
Finn finally

28:34.922 --> 28:36.881
got his peace talks.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.634
Something like that.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.887
Come on. We got
a lot of work to do.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.844
So much for the element
of surprise.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.011
I'll draw his fire.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.638
No. I will.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.620
Aagh!

30:03.761 --> 30:05.011
Hrrgh!

30:12.895 --> 30:15.646
Uh! Ah!

30:17.441 --> 30:18.816
Drop the weapon.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.654
Gah! Just let him kill me,
then take him out.

30:23.864 --> 30:27.533
Go on, Clarke. Please.
You people need you.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.286
You are my people.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.748
Ah...

30:36.752 --> 30:38.252
Uhh!

30:39.797 --> 30:42.632
Uh...

30:45.594 --> 30:47.845
Good shot.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.317
Did that make you
feel better?

31:01.527 --> 31:03.402
No.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.289
Ugh!

31:16.834 --> 31:19.752
Uh!

31:19.962 --> 31:21.921
Oh!

31:22.130 --> 31:25.716
Aagh!

31:25.926 --> 31:27.677
Uh! It's no use.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.887
Come on! We can do this.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.100
Wait. Listen.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.946
Lincoln. He did it.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.365
We still can't
get them out.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.242
Want to bet?
Get back in there.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.413
It's been 30 minutes. So
the girl is dead by now.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.416
I know that, lieutenant.
They've made their choice.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.751
Go in strong.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.670
Take them alive
if you can, but take them.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.213
Copy that.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.423
Throw in
the flashbangs.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.049
Fire in the hole.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.051
Let's go! Go!

32:13.932 --> 32:15.182
Mr. president...

32:32.784 --> 32:35.036
Find them.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.413
Yes, sir.
Come on. Let's go.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.378
It's all clear.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.343
Won't they see us?

32:50.552 --> 32:51.886
Relax. Maya took out
the cameras.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.137
Yeah, well,
we're still sitting ducks

32:53.347 --> 32:54.513
in a group like this.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.182
You're right.
So we're gonna split up.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.518
No. We do this together.
We survive together.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.020
Bellamy's right.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.521
Well, they don't
trust Maya anymore.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.274
Who the hell
is gonna help us now?

33:09.613 --> 33:11.822
They are.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.034
We're going
to hide you.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.369
Not everyone here
agrees with Cage,

33:16.578 --> 33:18.120
not by a long shot.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.456
Come with,me. We'll divide you
along the way. Let's go.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.418
It'll be OK.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.003
Let's go.
You're safe now.

33:26.213 --> 33:29.715
Quick, quick.
Go this way. That way. Go.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.467
Find your people.
Find your people. Go.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.887
Hey,
we're coming with you.

33:35.097 --> 33:36.722
No, you're not.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.599
They still don't
know I'm here,

33:38.809 --> 33:41.018
and I need to
keep it that way.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.144
So what do we do?

33:42.354 --> 33:46.232
Stay alive.
Be ready to fight.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.901
War is coming.

34:10.298 --> 34:13.175
Marcus...

34:15.262 --> 34:18.806
Marcus, Marcus,
wake up.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.601
Marcus, wake up.
Wake up!

34:22.811 --> 34:23.686
Uh!

34:25.731 --> 34:28.107
Nngh!

34:28.316 --> 34:29.734
Aah!

34:35.323 --> 34:36.782
Uh...

34:38.827 --> 34:42.204
Hold on. Hold on.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.585
Hold on. Hold on.

34:47.794 --> 34:51.213
It's still not working!

34:58.055 --> 34:59.055
Sky people!

34:59.264 --> 35:02.183
A group of them!

35:04.811 --> 35:06.687
We saw the missile,

35:06.897 --> 35:08.814
heard the blast, figured
you could use some help.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.317
Just in time.
Thank you.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.278
There's many more
down there.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.490
OK. All right.
We need help.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.743
I need everybody
on that rope.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.369
Make way.
Let it through.

35:24.831 --> 35:25.998
Marcus...

35:27.584 --> 35:28.542
Marcus...

35:31.129 --> 35:33.089
Do you hear that?

35:41.264 --> 35:44.475
We've got
two survivors.

35:46.061 --> 35:50.481
Abby, Kane, we'll
get you out of here.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.820
We're gonna be OK.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.618
All ready.

36:02.828 --> 36:07.039
Got them? Come on.
All right. Bring them up.

36:07.249 --> 36:10.251
Over here. Ugh!

36:11.419 --> 36:14.421
Here you go.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.550
Blood over here.
All right. Hurry up.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.510
OK.

36:25.725 --> 36:26.851
Oh...

36:30.313 --> 36:31.856
You did it.

36:32.065 --> 36:35.317
Yeah. I had
a little help.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.369
Kane needs blood,
"o" neg., right now.

36:45.579 --> 36:46.954
Abby, slow down.
You're bleeding.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.289
You need help, too.

36:48.498 --> 36:49.623
I'm fine.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.167
Heda!
Heda!

36:51.376 --> 36:52.710
Heda!
Heda!

36:52.919 --> 36:54.587
Heda!
Heda!

36:54.796 --> 36:57.214
Heda!
Heda!

37:00.677 --> 37:04.305
What happened here
will not stand.

37:04.514 --> 37:08.517
The Mountain
will fall.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.519
The dead will be avenged!

37:14.149 --> 37:16.609
Enough!
That's enough.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.321
There are still others
in the wreckage.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.115
We heard them.
Go to work!

37:24.826 --> 37:26.118
Let's get a rope up here.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.370
Haul them up. Let's go!

37:28.580 --> 37:29.955
Wait till I say.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.835
With our two people
working together,

37:35.045 --> 37:37.504
we're gonna win
this war, Clarke.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.020
You're not ready.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.189
I will not
miss this fight.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.948
You've done well,
Octavia of the sky people.

38:04.157 --> 38:09.411
Today you saved lives.
Tomorrow you'll take them.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.456
Now get my gear.
We leave with the commander.

38:19.923 --> 38:20.881
Wait.

38:47.951 --> 38:50.536
I thought
you were dead.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.955
I'm glad you're not.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.250
You, too.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.015
How's Kane?

39:11.224 --> 39:14.101
He'll live.

39:16.688 --> 39:20.357
We could really
use your help.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.652
I can't.
We're leaving.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.905
I've arranged for
a caravan to take you

39:27.115 --> 39:29.867
and the wounded
back to camp Jaha.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.785
Clarke--

39:31.995 --> 39:34.788
the sniper wasn't
wearing a Hazmat suit.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.419
The marrow treatment
works.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.047
They're gonna kill
all my friends.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.470
Then you
better hurry.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.271
I need you to do
something for me.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.151
Don't forget that
we're the good guys.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.653
It's time.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.583
May we meet again.
