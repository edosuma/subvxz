01:13.900 --> 01:15.670
Vikram!

01:22.233 --> 01:24.073
That's it?

01:24.100 --> 01:26.670
Big full moon parties going on
all down the coast.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.570
Demand is up,
so the supply is down.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.230
You know I've always been
your best customer, Vikram.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.827
That's what they all say.
Do you want this or not?

01:33.867 --> 01:36.067
Yes. Yes, I want it all.

01:37.367 --> 01:39.267
Just give me a minute, will you?

01:55.333 --> 01:57.503
He's alive. He's breathing!
Come on!

01:57.533 --> 01:59.133
Get him out of the water!

01:59.167 --> 02:01.067
Come on.
Can you help me here, buddy?

02:02.700 --> 02:04.430
That's good.

02:40.233 --> 02:43.103
Treat her like a lover
and she won't want to fight you.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.073
I thought you said
you could drive.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.570
I can. Cars!

02:46.600 --> 02:50.370
Sensible little cars with pedals
and automatic climate controls.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.630
More throttle. And this time,
ease the clutch out gently.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.427
Er...or you could always
ride pillion.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.273
A lot of girls prefer it?

03:08.633 --> 03:10.033
Right.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.127
Clutch...

03:11.167 --> 03:12.727
and down.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.427
3,000 revs.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.197
Clutch...

03:47.467 --> 03:49.797
Male, early 30s,
found face down in the sand.

03:53.833 --> 03:57.103
Lungs are clear - no sign of any
pulmonary oedema. He's lucky.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.433
- Does he have a name?
- Nothing was on the beach.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.467
- No bag or wallet.
- Probably a tourist.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
Early morning swim gone wrong.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.633
People underestimate
the currents.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.327
Most of them
are never seen again.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.367
A ray of sunshine as ever,
Dr Varma.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.570
Gorgeous and lucky.
An ideal combination.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.300
Can we say that
about a patient?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.632
A medical observation,
Dr Walker, nothing more.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.267
From the definition
of his rectus abdominis,

04:19.300 --> 04:20.800
it's obvious he
takes care of himself.

04:20.833 --> 04:24.033
I think these days
they call it a six pack.

04:24.067 --> 04:26.497
His identity will have to wait
till he comes round,

04:26.533 --> 04:28.473
or someone arrives to claim him.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.630
It can't be every day
you misplace an Adonis.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.627
Even on a full moon.
It's not just about the party.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.467
- I don't get how that's...
- Well, strange things happen.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.830
You know, things even
I can't explain - seriously.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.167
Do stop it!

04:40.200 --> 04:43.030
Dr Walker isn't a beach shack
seduction - she's here to work!

04:43.067 --> 04:45.297
She's not interested in
ridiculous superstition.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.003
This way, Dr Walker.

04:48.533 --> 04:51.203
If you can tear your eyes away
from his abdominals,

04:51.233 --> 04:52.803
I have a job for you.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.473
Dr Varma.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.100
I'm assuming you've done
a school check before?

04:57.133 --> 04:58.603
Actually, no.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.103
In England, the GP did it,
but I did community work.

05:01.133 --> 05:04.203
Small children are equally
disgusting the world over.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.703
Dr Varma here will help with
any communication issues.

05:06.733 --> 05:10.103
I'm quite capable of doing this
myself. It will be easier.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.433
But not as educational
for Dr Walker.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.427
How are
the language lessons going?

05:14.467 --> 05:16.827
Namaskaram!
Ente peru Ruby ennannu.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.427
Not bad, but the accent
is truly appalling.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.027
Still, I suppose Mumbai
wasn't built in a day.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.597
If Dr Varma would rather go
alone, I really don't mind.

05:24.633 --> 05:28.373
Whether this is nascent sexual
tension or genuine dislike,

05:28.400 --> 05:31.070
in this hospital we must all
find a way to work together,

05:31.100 --> 05:32.570
whether we like it or not.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.800
Make sure to check
the boys' testicles.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.603
As I recall,
two is the magic number.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.697
Is a blessing really necessary?

05:47.733 --> 05:50.133
On these roads, you need
all the help you can get.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.303
Should we have a lighter that
close to the petrol tank?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.530
Ready?

06:10.133 --> 06:11.733
OK, consider yourself blessed.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.097
I've asked both Ganesh
and Vishnu to protect you.

06:14.133 --> 06:15.733
If you insist on
driving in India,

06:15.767 --> 06:17.667
two gods
are better than one.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.167
Be safe!

06:55.300 --> 06:58.130
I don't see why we need
to involve him.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.397
We have an unidentified person
on the ward.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.403
And involving the police will
simply complicate the matter.

07:03.433 --> 07:04.533
Inspector Gomez...

07:04.567 --> 07:07.427
..is a hare-brained ignoramus
whose only saving grace

07:07.467 --> 07:10.067
is that he's eating himself
into an early grave.

07:10.100 --> 07:14.070
Who, despite all that,
is in a position of authority.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.070
Our mystery man
will come round soon enough.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.530
- And what if he doesn't?
- Sorry.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.397
Dr Fonseca. I thought you'd want
to know. He's awake.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.203
How many now?

07:24.233 --> 07:25.403
Three.

07:25.433 --> 07:28.803
Your brain appears to function,
at least at a basic level.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.833
Now all we need is a name.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.227
Sorry?

07:32.267 --> 07:34.197
They found you on the beach.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.803
No identification.
So we have no idea who you are.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.233
Just go around it!
Or run him over, I don't care.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.233
It's only a python.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.127
It's harmless.

08:08.167 --> 08:09.727
They can swallow a small dog

08:09.767 --> 08:13.297
but even pythons draw the line
at English doctors.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.573
Funny!

08:14.600 --> 08:16.430
Or you can turn around
and go back home.

08:16.467 --> 08:18.527
Keep on going
till you get back to England.

08:18.567 --> 08:22.267
Do you know you're very rude?
Disrespectful, in fact.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.100
But it's not gonna work.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.070
Are you on holiday? Travelling?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.299
I'm trying. I...just don't know.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.133
The accent, can you place it?

08:41.167 --> 08:42.626
Unhelpfully international.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.427
What's wrong with me?

08:44.467 --> 08:46.467
Physically, zero.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.530
Vous Ãªtes francais, peut-etre?

08:50.800 --> 08:53.300
Wie heisst du?

08:53.333 --> 08:56.303
So you're really telling us
you don't remember anything,

08:56.333 --> 08:59.773
that you have no memory
of your life before now?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.730
Nothing. Nothing at all.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.530
So...your call.

09:39.567 --> 09:42.497
Heads for pricks,
tails for balls.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.773
Tails?

09:45.133 --> 09:46.373
Tails it is.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.600
So I'll do the vaccinations.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.533
And the balls are all yours.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.767
Dr Varma usually
comes by himself.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.800
He must be glad of the help.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.573
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.770
I've always found him
most professional.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.670
Perhaps he's worried that the
children will like you more.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.470
Maybe we should get down
to business.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.330
First I'll need
to examine the boys,

10:11.367 --> 10:13.767
make sure they're all...
developing correctly.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.203
Of course.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.730
Er...

10:29.767 --> 10:32.027
I was thinking
maybe one at a time?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.830
That's a lot of tiny balls
for one morning.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.397
They're cute -

10:38.433 --> 10:41.203
the boys, not the balls.

10:41.233 --> 10:43.033
Are they always
this well behaved?

10:43.067 --> 10:44.267
Without fail.

10:44.300 --> 10:47.630
Because they hold their esteemed
teacher in such high regard.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.267
Or the fact I promised them

10:49.300 --> 10:51.670
they could all skip mathematics
if they kept quiet.

10:54.067 --> 10:57.197
- That's bribery, surely?
- This is India, Dr Walker.

10:57.233 --> 11:00.273
A bit of baksheesh now and then
makes our lives a little easier.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.400
I'm surprised
this is your first visit here.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.133
Don't you have relatives,
family?

11:04.167 --> 11:07.467
Possibly. Probably?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.200
My mother's English but my
father was born in Mumbai.

11:10.233 --> 11:12.403
They met back home
but he left when I was a baby.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.703
So you've never even met him?

11:14.733 --> 11:16.533
And you believe
he returned to India?

11:16.567 --> 11:18.097
I don't think anyone knows.

11:18.133 --> 11:21.103
Excuse me.

11:21.133 --> 11:22.533
Hey!

11:39.367 --> 11:41.027
Nothing?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.467
Profound
and total memory loss.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.430
I can see how that would make
it difficult to identify him.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.797
Yes, but what are you actually
going to do,

11:49.833 --> 11:52.303
apart from standing here
littering my office,

11:52.333 --> 11:54.333
masticating like a bovine?

11:54.367 --> 11:56.697
Well, if there's no crime
been committed...

11:58.067 --> 12:00.697
First we must follow
the approved procedure.

12:00.733 --> 12:05.103
A formal missing persons report,
then full state notification.

12:05.133 --> 12:08.033
We should have a preliminary
answer within a week or so.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.467
A week! Ridiculous!

12:09.500 --> 12:12.030
My patient doesn't have a week!
I need an answer today.

12:12.067 --> 12:15.267
Here's a thought - why don't you
go and find out who he is?

12:15.300 --> 12:17.630
Ask questions, look for clues.
You have six hours.

12:17.667 --> 12:20.067
And give me that chocolate,
you're too fat!

12:20.100 --> 12:22.300
No wonder your
blood pressure's sky high.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.697
What are you waiting for?
Go!

12:45.700 --> 12:47.330
Hello?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.097
How can I... Not again!

12:50.133 --> 12:52.203
This bastard just bit me.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.273
Where this time?

12:53.300 --> 12:55.430
Just now, behind the old bakery.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.367
Where on your body?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
On my leg. Here.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.333
Must have sneaked up behind me.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.167
The place is crawling!

13:04.200 --> 13:07.230
It's the grain brings the rats,
the rats bring the snakes.

13:07.267 --> 13:10.267
And the snakes bring Juan
Gonzalo, the snake catcher.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.100
Only now, they're biting back!

13:13.133 --> 13:16.033
- May I see it, please?
- Yeah.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.567
The snake.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.203
Here.

13:23.833 --> 13:26.773
- Russell's viper?
- Correct.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.570
I blame it on the full moon.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.270
Always makes them
more aggressive.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.070
- Russell's viper...
- I'll fetch the antivenom.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.130
Thank you.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.697
Yet again, Juan.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.233
Senor Gonzalo.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.527
I'm Ram Nair.
I'm the senior doctor here.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.797
Along with Dr Fonseca.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.833
I know the good doctor.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.827
May we take a look
at your leg, please?

14:03.867 --> 14:05.367
Yes.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.370
Is there a problem?

14:18.233 --> 14:20.533
Yes, I understand.
I'm on my way.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.833
Hey, where you going?

14:23.867 --> 14:25.727
We've run out of
antivenom again.

14:25.767 --> 14:28.097
I need to fetch some
from the Dhoni Clinic.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.703
You need to get back on your
own. Think you can handle that?

14:30.733 --> 14:32.733
I'm sure I'll cope. About the...

14:32.767 --> 14:35.127
boy you were talking to...

14:36.700 --> 14:38.700
You're being abandoned?

14:38.733 --> 14:40.733
There was an emergency.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.267
But I think we were pretty much
finished here.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.070
I was going to ask Dr Varma.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.070
Could you take a look at someone
for me before you leave?

14:48.100 --> 14:49.630
A child I have
some concerns about.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.267
He's been falling behind
in class, losing weight too.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.670
- Yeah, of course.
- Vijay!

15:04.833 --> 15:07.073
You're Dr Varma's friend,
aren't you?

15:09.767 --> 15:11.467
Doctors are like rats.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.300
One could be
just passing through.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.633
Two, mean you've definitely
got a problem.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.030
I mean, usually
you just jab me in the back

15:19.067 --> 15:20.767
and send me back to work.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.530
There's no antivenom left.

15:23.567 --> 15:26.627
The nearest supply
is in the city.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.667
We're doing our best to get you
some as soon as possible.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.133
I... I see.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.573
Well, in that case...

15:38.567 --> 15:40.697
..I'd like you to call
this number, please.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.427
Please.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.500
Well, his examination is normal,

15:58.533 --> 16:01.103
but I agree,
he seems small for his age.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.373
Any other symptoms?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.270
He falls asleep
in class sometimes.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.670
Sometimes has abdominal pains.
I think he's hungry.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.470
What about his parents?
Are they concerned too?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.770
That's part of the problem. I
understand the father is absent.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.070
I tried Vijay's mother
but she doesn't respond.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.430
- Does she live nearby?
- The next village.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.797
I think she has a stall
at the local flea market.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.833
I should take some blood tests.

16:21.867 --> 16:25.697
Normally we check with parents,
but in the circumstances...

16:25.733 --> 16:27.473
Please...

16:31.100 --> 16:32.200
Nanni.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.333
- What did he say?
- That he is brave.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.327
Also that your accent is funny.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.027
These are lovely, Paul.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.767
Yes, I'll take them.
They're only 200.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.070
Nanni. Put them
in that black bag there.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.170
There's another stall I just
want to have a quick look at.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.233
Nice colour. OK.

17:00.533 --> 17:01.673
Beautiful.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.730
This is our highest quality
garment.

17:03.767 --> 17:05.597
It's really lovely.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.573
But I've spent so much
already today.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.030
My husband will have my guts
for garters.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.067
But this is your perfect colour.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.829
Surely your husband
will see that immediately?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.827
You're not wrong.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.027
And they do say
you only live once?

17:20.267 --> 17:23.327
Actually, Hindus believe
we all live many lives.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.329
Sir! Insect!

17:27.367 --> 17:29.667
Insect in your ear!

17:29.700 --> 17:32.700
- Please! Huge one!
- What? Where? Christ!

17:32.733 --> 17:34.733
OK, sir. Gone now!

17:34.767 --> 17:36.597
I take away. Please!

17:36.633 --> 17:39.573
- Please! Please!
- Get out of here!

17:39.600 --> 17:40.730
I'm sorry.

17:40.767 --> 17:43.497
Little conman!
Let me help you, sir.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.603
No, don't worry. It's fine.
I can do it.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.133
Not more?

17:58.167 --> 18:00.067
I'll give you a twirl.

18:13.267 --> 18:15.027
I'll let you know as soon
as we get the results.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.827
Thank you.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.067
- It's the full moon tonight.
- I know!

18:19.100 --> 18:20.600
Weird things happen, right?

18:20.633 --> 18:22.573
Magic in the air,
the dead walk the earth.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.670
Everyone round here
goes to Greg's.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.730
If you're free tonight...

18:26.767 --> 18:30.427
Sounds fun but I was thinking
of hitting the phrase book.

18:30.467 --> 18:33.067
Lydia wants me fluent
by the end of the month.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.330
It's more original than
the hair-washing excuse.

18:36.367 --> 18:39.327
Clearly I meet a lot of women
who have dirty hair.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.367
No excuses, honestly.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.130
Plus...

18:44.167 --> 18:46.397
- It's a long story.
- The best kind.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.333
I'm sort of getting
over someone.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.367
On my own.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.230
I understand.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.267
A broken heart
needs time to mend.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.830
And perhaps a little distance?

18:58.867 --> 19:01.027
Thank you for helping Vijay.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.127
- Let me know what you find.
- Of course.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.070
I guess
that might've been my fault.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.067
I can give you a lift.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.567
- OK?
- Yeah.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.500
Move over, Vishnu.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.573
What are you doing in my home?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.200
Who are you?

20:21.233 --> 20:22.503
I'm Dr Walker.

20:22.533 --> 20:24.233
Ruby Walker,
from the hos...pital.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.800
You did this?

20:26.833 --> 20:29.073
It's simply a routine
blood sample.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.730
I know we should have asked
your permission first.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.400
Of course, it might just be
simple failure to thrive.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.533
You know how I feel about
those vultures!

20:41.567 --> 20:43.767
But I'm concerned
the child is neglected.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.670
- I want to know who let him in!
- Senor Gonzalo insisted.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.530
- Dr Fonseca!
- Will you just wait?

20:48.567 --> 20:51.197
I can only be furious
about one thing at a time!

20:54.633 --> 20:55.833
You, out!

20:55.867 --> 20:56.927
Now!

20:56.967 --> 20:59.567
Senor Gonzalo asked me
to hear his last confession.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.130
Did he now? Then, in that case,
I'll save you both a job.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.467
All this man's done for the last
ten years is gamble,

21:05.500 --> 21:08.470
kill snakes and drink too much
coconut feni on a Friday night.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.170
He also cheats at gin rummy
but thinks no one notices.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.400
- That's a lie! I never cheat!
- Get out of my hospital.

21:14.567 --> 21:17.097
- Say three Hail Marys and a...
- Out!

21:23.167 --> 21:24.527
Give me your hand.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.300
Now you listen to me,
Juan Gonzalo.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.733
Dr Varma will get
the antivenom here in time.

21:34.767 --> 21:37.827
You will die only when
I tell you that you can die

21:37.867 --> 21:40.427
and not a minute before,
do you understand?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.427
Good.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.200
Increase the fluids.
Another dose of steroids.

21:48.233 --> 21:50.133
- And no more priests!
- Yes, Dr Fonseca.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.727
- Where is Dr Varma?
- I'll call him now.

22:09.567 --> 22:10.597
Nanni.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.703
Hey! Hey, hey!

22:44.733 --> 22:45.703
Hey!

23:28.133 --> 23:31.333
Total amnesia. Remarkable.

23:31.367 --> 23:33.297
I haven't seen a case like that
since 1987.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.173
He really has no idea who he is?

23:35.200 --> 23:36.800
So it seems.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.667
The police are investigating,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.470
if you can dignify it
with that label.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.630
Why don't you go and talk
to him, Dr Walker?

23:44.667 --> 23:46.427
You're a similar age.
See what you can find out.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.097
What exactly
do you want me to do?

23:48.133 --> 23:50.133
Examine, chat, interrogate.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.167
Just make him open up.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.600
Use your feminine wiles.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.673
About the child
at the school...

23:55.700 --> 23:57.030
And then come and find me!

24:05.767 --> 24:07.597
What is it telling you, exactly?

24:07.633 --> 24:09.633
I'm testing your pupil reaction.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.367
Also, it looks professional.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.600
You're sure
you're a real doctor?

24:13.633 --> 24:14.903
Honestly?

24:14.933 --> 24:18.503
It isn't really my area but the
boss asked me to examine you.

24:18.533 --> 24:20.533
I need to make it look good,
so...

24:20.567 --> 24:22.467
Just go with it, OK?

24:24.167 --> 24:25.827
So what is your area?

24:25.867 --> 24:28.027
Paediatrics - kids.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.067
At least it was.

24:30.100 --> 24:33.200
Now I'm meant to turn my hand to
anything. In a foreign language.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.300
So do you remember anything?

24:38.333 --> 24:39.803
Parents?

24:39.833 --> 24:41.433
Friends?

24:41.467 --> 24:43.697
- Nothing.
- Aren't you scared?

24:45.667 --> 24:47.127
I would be.

24:47.167 --> 24:50.367
The other doctor said it usually
comes back...eventually.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.300
But what if it doesn't?

24:53.600 --> 24:55.370
Would that be such a bad thing?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.370
I'd be scared. I mean...

24:58.400 --> 25:01.200
My life hasn't exactly
been perfect, but...

25:02.467 --> 25:04.367
..I'd want to know it happened.

25:05.767 --> 25:08.727
But haven't you ever dreamed
of a new life?

25:08.767 --> 25:13.027
To just wipe the slate clean,
start again?

25:14.500 --> 25:17.300
Sometimes the past isn't
something you want back.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.367
Something doesn't quite add up.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.730
Which is?

25:21.767 --> 25:23.797
I'm not sure.
It's just a feeling.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.533
The woman who works in the
corner shop has feelings.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.227
Doctors work in specifics.
Well?

25:29.267 --> 25:30.627
If you lost your life,

25:30.667 --> 25:32.797
everything that makes you
who you are,

25:32.833 --> 25:34.833
wouldn't you want it back,

25:34.867 --> 25:37.127
more than anything else
in the world?

25:37.167 --> 25:38.797
- Precisely.
- Dr Fonseca!

25:40.567 --> 25:42.467
We'll make a real doctor
of you yet.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.830
Get me 200 milligrams
of hydrocortisone.

25:58.867 --> 26:02.127
- We'll need some adrenaline.
- Magdalena! Is that you?

26:02.167 --> 26:04.567
It's his late wife.
He keeps asking for her.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
What the hell's keeping
Dr Varma?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.803
Hurry up with those steroids,
please.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.373
And get that priest back.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.030
I commend you, my dear brother,
to Almighty God,

26:14.067 --> 26:15.567
and entrust you
to your Creator.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.100
May you return to Him who formed
you from the dust of the earth.

26:19.133 --> 26:22.473
May the holy Virgin Mary,
the angels, and all the saints

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
come to meet you,
as you go forth...

26:24.533 --> 26:26.233
Where the hell have you been?

26:38.333 --> 26:39.803
What happens now?

26:39.833 --> 26:41.403
We wait.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.673
And pray.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.200
Come!

26:59.233 --> 27:03.073
I've given you a whole day.
How much time do you need?

27:03.100 --> 27:07.070
The correct procedures
must be adhered too.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.600
Typical man.

27:08.633 --> 27:11.533
Obsessed with rules and
incapable of getting results.

27:11.567 --> 27:14.797
Dr Fonseca,
I must formally protest.

27:14.833 --> 27:18.133
To regard all men
as equally useless

27:18.167 --> 27:20.797
is prejudice at its most vile.

27:20.833 --> 27:22.733
You had your chance
and found nothing.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.827
And don't you
lecture me on prejudice.

27:24.867 --> 27:29.127
We women, as usual, will have
to deal with this ourselves.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.670
You can't just retire.
What about my alcohol supply?

27:33.700 --> 27:35.600
Old men must make way for youth.

27:38.767 --> 27:40.797
Dr Fonseca.
Can I get you a drink?

27:40.833 --> 27:43.403
Anyone who drinks before 6pm
is a dipsomaniac.

27:43.433 --> 27:47.103
You insult both my customers
and my business model.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.033
I need your help.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.397
He's really got no memory?

27:52.433 --> 27:54.273
He says his mind
is a complete blank.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.730
I want you to talk to him.
You have a lot in common.

27:56.767 --> 28:00.067
I've heard nothing round here.
Could ask around again,

28:00.100 --> 28:02.200
find some people
further up the coast,

28:02.233 --> 28:03.733
if I wasn't so busy today.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.327
Come on. You'll be doing
a vital public service!

28:06.367 --> 28:08.527
And you're asking
an idiot man like me?

28:08.567 --> 28:10.367
Indication of my desperation.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.670
If you weren't so nice to me,
I might take off...

28:12.700 --> 28:15.300
Careful. There are plenty more
options, you know.

28:15.333 --> 28:19.103
Yet night after night, you
consistently refuse them.

28:19.133 --> 28:21.533
I don't pretend to understand,
Dr Fonseca.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.597
I just lie back
and think of England.

28:23.633 --> 28:25.633
Are you refusing to help me?

28:25.667 --> 28:28.267
I didn't say that.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.430
Perhaps there's something
you could do for me first.

28:31.467 --> 28:33.697
Vikram?

28:33.733 --> 28:35.173
Vikram?

28:41.533 --> 28:43.633
Age-related
cervical spondylosis.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.267
Retirement is the only option.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.570
That's your advice?

28:46.600 --> 28:49.530
You'll have to get your booze
from a legitimate wholesaler.

28:49.567 --> 28:53.097
- Where did you get that?
- Found it on the beach today.

28:53.133 --> 28:55.703
I can't read it.
I think it's Russian.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.303
That's not Russian,
that's Hebrew.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.803
I need to take this.
Or we can discuss my fee?

29:07.133 --> 29:08.673
Thank you.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.800
He's Israeli.

29:44.233 --> 29:46.733
Private Silver?

29:46.767 --> 29:49.067
I think you'd better start
talking, don't you?

29:51.167 --> 29:52.567
I threw this in the water.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.500
I thought I was done
with the Army.

29:55.533 --> 29:58.503
My unit has been here
for a week on leave.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.433
Yesterday was my last night.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.097
Suddenly, I just knew that
I couldn't go back there.

30:05.133 --> 30:08.103
I knew I couldn't be a soldier
any more.

30:12.433 --> 30:14.133
I'd asked to be released

30:14.167 --> 30:16.167
but they told me
it would be impossible.

30:17.767 --> 30:19.227
So I went to the beach.

30:19.267 --> 30:21.467
I wanted to walk, to think.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.000
Then I saw the moon.

30:26.433 --> 30:29.203
It was as if it was
calling out to me.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.200
And in that moment,
it felt like the only answer.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.503
You wanted to die?

30:36.533 --> 30:38.433
I think I did...

30:39.567 --> 30:41.097
..last night.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.703
I don't believe in God.

30:43.733 --> 30:45.533
Something saved me.

30:45.567 --> 30:48.467
Something wanted me to live
and to leave the past behind.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.100
A new life.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.073
All I had to do
was forget the old one.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.170
Do you have a family
back home?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.330
A mother in Tel Aviv,
a sister...

30:57.367 --> 30:59.627
And they love you, this family?

30:59.667 --> 31:01.227
Yes, they do.

31:01.267 --> 31:02.697
Do you think they'll forget you?

31:02.733 --> 31:04.333
It's my choice...

31:04.367 --> 31:05.697
my life.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.767
Will your mum forget you when
she walks down the street?

31:10.800 --> 31:15.170
Or will she stare at every young
man, willing them to be her son?

31:15.200 --> 31:18.300
Or will she wait by the phone,
hoping and praying to get a call

31:18.333 --> 31:22.603
telling her that her missing son
has been found safe and well?

31:22.633 --> 31:25.733
People here say there's
a little magic in the full moon.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.797
I say it's nonsense
and superstition,

31:27.833 --> 31:29.603
but just maybe I'm wrong.

31:29.633 --> 31:31.603
Just maybe
you're the living proof.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.727
Too many lost souls
go missing in this world.

31:36.767 --> 31:38.667
Don't be one of them.

31:40.567 --> 31:44.067
If the full moon saved you, then
maybe it saved you for a reason.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.600
To go home again.

31:50.633 --> 31:51.773
Here.

32:07.833 --> 32:10.533
You sensed it too.
No real panic, no emotion.

32:10.567 --> 32:13.197
Because he was faking.
We just had to prove it.

32:13.233 --> 32:17.173
Medicine is more than lists
and tables, Dr Walker.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.630
The real skill is to learn
how to read their minds.

32:19.667 --> 32:22.597
- What will they do to him?
- Counselling, I expect.

32:22.633 --> 32:24.703
Or a military prison.
One of the two.

32:24.733 --> 32:26.573
You don't care?

32:26.600 --> 32:28.330
We all make bad decisions
in life.

32:28.367 --> 32:29.797
Just don't compound the error.

32:29.833 --> 32:32.103
- The money you gave my son.
- What's going on?

32:32.133 --> 32:34.373
- 200, 250...
- It's the boy from the school.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
The one I was trying
to talk to you about.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.800
How dare you touch my son
with that money?

32:39.833 --> 32:43.033
He gave her that money
to buy food for Vijay, I think.

32:43.067 --> 32:45.067
Perhaps he's attempting
to atone.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.270
Doctor Fonseca?
It's Mr Gonzalo.

33:10.133 --> 33:11.373
Thank you.

33:14.433 --> 33:16.333
What the hell is he doing here?

33:18.233 --> 33:20.173
You took bloods without consent?

33:20.200 --> 33:22.170
His teacher was concerned
about him.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.270
Weight loss, failure to thrive,
I just did some basic screening.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.330
We need parental consent for all
medical procedures whatsoever.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.197
The rules are as strict here
as in the UK.

33:30.233 --> 33:32.273
Even if I believe it was
in his best interests?

33:32.300 --> 33:34.370
You know nothing about
the family circumstances.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.500
I saw you.

33:36.533 --> 33:38.473
I saw you give him that money

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
and I saw her throw it back
in your face.

33:40.533 --> 33:42.433
Why?

33:42.467 --> 33:44.367
That is none of your business.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.270
Dr Varma?
Nanni.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.200
Our appointment?

33:59.700 --> 34:01.400
I know you're a busy man,

34:01.433 --> 34:04.233
but I haven't got time to sit
twiddling my thumbs.

34:04.267 --> 34:07.127
Come.

34:07.167 --> 34:11.496
So your brain tumour is called
Anaplastic astrocytoma.

34:11.533 --> 34:14.072
Now it's not suitable
for surgery.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.730
You have declined radiotherapy.

34:15.766 --> 34:18.427
So median survival
in cases like yours is...

34:18.467 --> 34:20.527
Six months to a year.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.527
I don't want to go home.

34:23.766 --> 34:27.067
If I stay, I need to know
you can help me.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.500
This is a complex condition.

34:31.266 --> 34:33.597
As a doctor,
I'd have to recommend

34:33.632 --> 34:37.333
that you return home
and be cared for by specialists.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.266
What if I refuse to go?

34:40.766 --> 34:42.766
What if I refuse to help you?

34:42.800 --> 34:44.670
If ifs and buts
were pots and pans,

34:44.699 --> 34:46.600
we'd have no need for tinkers.

34:48.632 --> 34:51.303
I'm sorry, I have absolutely
no idea what you just said.

34:56.300 --> 35:00.100
I have fallen in love,
Dr Varma.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.003
With this place.
With India.

35:05.267 --> 35:07.667
I've lived on this planet
for over 60 years

35:07.700 --> 35:11.400
and I never knew a heaven
like this even existed.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.770
I need to know
you understand the risk.

35:17.367 --> 35:20.497
The treatment we can offer you
here is basic.

35:20.533 --> 35:23.533
Now, if there's an emergency,
we may not be able to help.

35:24.833 --> 35:28.433
And if that happens...
you will die here.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.070
That's the plan.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.700
Ssh.

35:33.733 --> 35:35.773
Don't tell anyone.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.700
I understand.

35:40.067 --> 35:42.297
Help me. Please.

35:44.867 --> 35:47.067
What does your husband
think about this,

35:47.100 --> 35:48.700
about staying in Barco?

35:48.733 --> 35:51.603
He's behind me 150 per cent.

35:51.633 --> 35:54.203
So...do we have a deal, then?

35:58.800 --> 36:01.070
Against my better judgment...

36:01.100 --> 36:02.170
yes.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.067
See? I'm gonna get it all in.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.830
I know you thought you'd defeat
me, but guess what?

36:18.867 --> 36:21.497
You can fold your way
out of any crisis.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.133
What?

36:30.767 --> 36:32.667
I don't understand.

36:34.633 --> 36:37.503
What have we got to go back to?
I mean, really?

36:37.533 --> 36:39.373
Home, family.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.530
NH bloody S.

36:40.567 --> 36:44.367
I've checked. The local hospital
will take care of me.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.170
Great.
That's fine, then.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.770
Silly me,
worrying about nothing.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.030
You know I hate it
when you're sarcastic.

36:50.067 --> 36:53.027
And I hate it when you get
diagnosed with a brain tumour

36:53.067 --> 36:55.297
and decide on a whim
to stay in bloody India!

36:55.333 --> 36:57.573
Christ! Bollocks!

37:00.100 --> 37:03.170
I just don't get it.
What's this about, Maggie?

37:03.200 --> 37:06.000
Make me understand
what the hell this is about.

37:07.567 --> 37:10.427
You remember that time when we
went to the South of France

37:10.467 --> 37:14.097
on the back of that...
damned motorbike?

37:14.133 --> 37:15.603
'72.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.803
'73.

37:16.833 --> 37:21.473
And three miles outside Lyon,
I told you I was pregnant.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.400
And you didn't say a word.

37:23.433 --> 37:25.433
Just put your helmet on
and we set off.

37:27.833 --> 37:31.373
Then at the next stop,
you asked me to marry you.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.130
I remember.

37:34.267 --> 37:36.167
I loved that trip.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.467
But that was the last time...

37:41.500 --> 37:44.130
it was just you and me.

37:44.167 --> 37:46.067
The two of us together.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.367
Like the rest of the world
didn't exist.

37:52.133 --> 37:54.133
Then it was...

37:54.167 --> 37:57.427
the kids, family,
your bloody mother.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.527
But you and me...

38:01.567 --> 38:03.467
was how it all started.

38:05.433 --> 38:06.733
And you and me...

38:08.333 --> 38:11.273
..is how I want it to end.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.500
Together.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.230
Please.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.773
You know how much
this bloody place costs?

38:26.800 --> 38:29.600
We can't afford to stay here.

38:29.633 --> 38:31.333
Don't worry.

38:31.367 --> 38:33.267
I've thought of that already.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.500
What do you think?

38:58.800 --> 39:00.370
Lovely.

39:12.133 --> 39:14.033
Look at this.

39:31.367 --> 39:33.697
Coming through. Yeah.

39:33.733 --> 39:35.733
So how did you manage
to replace me?

39:35.767 --> 39:37.367
I called for an ambulance.

39:38.733 --> 39:41.403
- So?
- Waved me across the border.

39:41.433 --> 39:43.173
I told them they could
look inside

39:43.200 --> 39:46.300
but only if I vaccinated
them all for Lydia Fever first.

39:46.333 --> 39:49.203
- Lydia Fever?
- I made it up. Deadly, no cure.

39:49.233 --> 39:51.233
Tell me about it.

39:51.267 --> 39:52.497
Right.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.433
Champagne!

39:58.067 --> 39:59.827
One beer, one pina colada.

39:59.867 --> 40:02.397
Fully loaded. I've gone legit.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.433
Everything imported
fair and square.

40:04.467 --> 40:07.127
Of course, now I'm losing
money on the deal.

40:07.167 --> 40:09.997
Sometimes life has a way of
rewarding the virtuous.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.233
What's the matter with you?

40:21.700 --> 40:25.430
I'm still worried about Vijay
and Dr Varma.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.730
It was nearly five years ago.

40:29.767 --> 40:32.697
Vijay's father was
an extremely anxious man,

40:32.733 --> 40:34.533
always at the hospital,

40:34.567 --> 40:37.327
complaining of one spurious
malady or another.

40:37.367 --> 40:38.697
Always nothing.

40:38.733 --> 40:42.173
This time it was
lower abdominal pain.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.400
Gabriel didn't consider it
serious, sent him away.

40:45.433 --> 40:47.433
- His wife was with him.
- I met her.

40:47.467 --> 40:50.597
She called her husband lots of
names and dragged him home.

40:50.633 --> 40:55.033
Next morning, she found him dead
from a ruptured appendix.

40:55.067 --> 40:58.227
As you can imagine,
Gabriel took it very hard.

40:58.267 --> 41:01.227
A wife without a husband,
a fatherless child.

41:01.267 --> 41:02.497
And she blames him.

41:04.133 --> 41:05.773
We doctors can bury
our mistakes,

41:05.800 --> 41:07.770
it doesn't mean
we can ever forget them.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.500
I'm gonna...

41:27.500 --> 41:28.730
Hi.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.600
I erm...spoke to Lydia.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.433
She told me about Vijay's dad.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.000
She shouldn't have told you.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.300
Well, I'm glad she did.

41:47.333 --> 41:50.403
In case you hadn't noticed,
this is an official apology.

41:53.500 --> 41:57.400
I was younger, I was arrogant.

41:57.433 --> 41:59.433
I thought I knew everything.

41:59.467 --> 42:01.367
Unlike now, right?

42:03.533 --> 42:05.433
We all get it wrong sometimes.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.467
Vijay's mum shouldn't blame you.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.000
Well, I disagree.

42:14.233 --> 42:16.533
Thanks to me,
her husband is dead.

42:18.533 --> 42:21.403
Our actions have consequences.

42:21.433 --> 42:23.333
Sometimes there are no excuses.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.473
How's the study?

42:32.767 --> 42:35.497
I was er...sort of persuaded.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.633
So I see.

42:38.667 --> 42:41.597
Can I get you a beer?

42:41.633 --> 42:44.473
- You're alone?
- Yeah, looks that way.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.470
And this is what I call
a Full Moon Fandango.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.070
Enjoy! Love in a glass.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.800
Cheers.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.373
Be gentle with him.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.470
Evening.

43:13.167 --> 43:15.197
Morning!

43:15.233 --> 43:17.033
Pina Colada.

43:17.067 --> 43:19.067
Guaranteed hangover-proof.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.700
I'll try and keep that in mind.

43:20.733 --> 43:23.033
And to stay on speaking terms
with your liver,

43:23.067 --> 43:24.667
avoid the Mumbai Scotch.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.530
Greg swore
it was ten years old.

43:26.567 --> 43:29.167
There's one born every minute,
Dr Varma.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.030
However,
your nocturnal activities

43:31.067 --> 43:32.297
are none of my business.

43:32.333 --> 43:34.603
Here are the blood results
to be checked and filed.

43:34.633 --> 43:36.703
Whilst the analgesia
takes effect,

43:36.733 --> 43:38.633
you can both meet me
on the wards.

44:12.467 --> 44:14.667
- What do you want?
- Can I come in?

44:14.700 --> 44:16.700
It's about Vijay.

44:16.733 --> 44:17.773
Dr Walker.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.100
Vijay is intolerant to gluten.

44:30.133 --> 44:31.803
It explains everything -

44:31.833 --> 44:34.073
the weight loss,
lack of concentration.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.170
Coeliac disease
is unusual in India

44:36.200 --> 44:38.100
but not unknown.

44:38.133 --> 44:40.203
- You told her?
- First thing.

44:40.233 --> 44:41.733
She seemed happy.

44:41.767 --> 44:43.667
She didn't slam the door
in my face.

44:45.267 --> 44:47.597
"Well done, Dr Walker.
Nice work back there.

44:47.633 --> 44:49.273
Congratulations."

44:50.767 --> 44:52.567
How is she?

44:52.600 --> 44:54.200
Well...

44:55.300 --> 44:56.730
The odds were against it, but...

44:58.100 --> 45:01.370
..I think she's going
to pull through.
