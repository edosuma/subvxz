Roger that.
Medevac 305 approaching the pad.

00:27.177 --> 00:28.861
Medevac, I see you!

00:29.012 --> 00:30.696
MANNY:
It's weird.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.272
What's that?

00:32.424 --> 00:33.924
The place where
this heart's coming from,

00:33.942 --> 00:36.109
that was a tragedy.

00:36.262 --> 00:38.704
But once we land, it's gonna
turn into a miracle, right?

00:38.931 --> 00:40.855
(chuckles softly)

00:40.875 --> 00:43.292
Yeah. I like that.

00:43.952 --> 00:46.295
Miracle incoming.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.724
Ah, I can't see the pad--
hang on!

00:58.951 --> 01:00.784
Pulling up!

01:00.803 --> 01:02.452
What the hell?

01:02.471 --> 01:04.396
I've lost the whole tail rotor.

01:07.459 --> 01:08.734
Hang on!

01:10.813 --> 01:12.479
Generator should've kicked in
automatically.

01:12.631 --> 01:13.630
Something's wrong.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.908
-(thudding above)
-(shouting, clamoring)

01:16.059 --> 01:17.984
That came from the roof.

01:18.137 --> 01:20.454
Let's go.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.505
The generators will have
to wait.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.324
EDDIE:
Window washing cables.
This thing's holding on

01:40.417 --> 01:42.826
-by a thread, Cap.
-118, I want ropes,

01:42.919 --> 01:45.345
webbing and the heavy winch
on the rooftop, double-time.

01:45.497 --> 01:47.589
-We're not waiting
for any of that, right?
-No!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.333
First thing we do is get
those rotors turned off.

01:49.351 --> 01:51.351
Hen, Buck, you check that cabin

01:51.503 --> 01:53.261
and see what we got.
Eddie, you're with me.

01:53.355 --> 01:55.489
(coughing)

02:01.864 --> 02:03.847
Kid! Can you hear me?!

02:03.866 --> 02:05.290
Can't move.

02:05.517 --> 02:06.683
Chim, this is Hen.

02:06.702 --> 02:08.776
I need you to bring me
a backboard and C-collar

02:08.796 --> 02:10.704
-from inside.
-Copy that.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.281
Hang in there, kid,
we're gonna put this fire out

02:13.300 --> 02:15.050
and then get you out, okay?

02:19.531 --> 02:21.390
It's slipping!

02:27.982 --> 02:30.983
(grunting)

02:34.229 --> 02:37.138
-Help me!
-We're okay! We're okay!

02:37.158 --> 02:39.733
We're okay. You're okay.

02:39.885 --> 02:41.218
Wh-What's your name?

02:41.311 --> 02:43.144
-Manny.
-Manny?

02:43.238 --> 02:44.554
How long you been a paramedic?

02:44.573 --> 02:46.481
-Been at it almost a month.
-Oh, wow.

02:46.575 --> 02:48.000
You're lucky, Manny!

02:48.227 --> 02:50.410
It was a while before I got
to see any real action.

02:50.562 --> 02:52.820
This ain't quite the action
I was hoping for.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.080
You're gonna be okay, kid.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.583
Buck, let's get
the pilot out of here!

02:56.735 --> 02:59.586
(grunting)

02:59.680 --> 03:00.721
Here.

03:01.831 --> 03:02.923
Backboard!

03:03.075 --> 03:04.850
-Hen, what do we got?
-Spinal.

03:05.077 --> 03:06.076
I'm guessing cervical.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.352
We need to flip him
on this backboard.

03:07.504 --> 03:09.262
-That's a two-person job.
-EDDIE: I'm available!

03:09.356 --> 03:10.672
Trick is,
how do we do that here?

03:10.766 --> 03:12.416
The backboard's long enough
to cover this opening.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.267
-You're gonna flip me
over the window?
-I know.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.844
-It's not optimal.
-No, very not optimal!

03:16.864 --> 03:18.588
Listen, it'll work.
Strap him in.

03:18.607 --> 03:20.532
We'll figure out a way
to pull him out.

03:24.187 --> 03:25.779
All right, flip him on three.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.873
One, two, three!

03:28.100 --> 03:30.358
(grunts)

03:30.377 --> 03:32.860
-How you doing, Manny?
-Breathing's good.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.028
Pulse feels right.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.030
-Okay.
-I can move my fingers.

03:36.124 --> 03:37.716
Not my toes.

03:38.535 --> 03:40.219
That's good, Manny.

03:40.446 --> 03:42.721
You're making our job very easy.

03:42.948 --> 03:44.372
Thanks for that.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.642
Good job.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.062
Eddie!

03:50.213 --> 03:52.689
Secure this to the board.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.811
-All set, Cap!
-Okay, we're all set!

03:57.963 --> 03:59.363
Go!

04:00.056 --> 04:01.314
Wait!

04:01.408 --> 04:02.991

04:09.065 --> 04:10.640

04:11.401 --> 04:13.643
You worry about that later.
Let's get him out.

04:13.662 --> 04:15.161
EDDIE:
Go, Hen, come on!

04:15.256 --> 04:17.071
Get him up over that ledge!

04:17.165 --> 04:19.574

in his lower extremities.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.841
Possible spinal cord injury.
He needs cold fluids right away.

CHIMNEY:
Once we get the generators
running, prep for a CT

04:47.863 --> 04:49.179
and put him in a cold OR.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.748

He was brought in five days ago.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.388
Some kids found him
in MacArthur Park.

09:16.539 --> 09:17.872

09:17.966 --> 09:20.617
Looked like he'd been dumped
there-- no wallet, no I.D.

09:20.635 --> 09:23.970
He lost a lot of blood, and we
were able to repair the wound,

09:24.122 --> 09:25.955
but it caused a stroke.

09:26.049 --> 09:27.791

31:58.475 --> 32:00.900
in the apartment
with a baby and no power.

32:00.994 --> 32:02.586
Yeah, but it's Maddie.

32:02.737 --> 32:04.813
She's been through worse
than a blackout, Chim.

32:04.831 --> 32:07.424
And she's always been able
to handle herself.

32:10.988 --> 32:12.988
Yeah, Maddie's...

32:13.006 --> 32:14.990
not really Maddie lately.

32:15.008 --> 32:17.917
She has postpartum depression.

32:18.011 --> 32:19.436
It started a few months ago.

32:19.587 --> 32:22.731
It's kind of been
a roller-coaster ride.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.850
No one knows?

32:26.003 --> 32:27.444
No.

32:27.595 --> 32:29.613
She already feels like a failure
'cause she's struggling so much.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.491
So other people knowing
would just make it worse.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.178
So you're hovering?

32:36.196 --> 32:38.288
Maybe, a little.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.107
Probably a lot. I just
don't know how to stop myself.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.518
Chim, she's not your patient.

32:43.611 --> 32:45.445
She's your partner.

32:45.539 --> 32:48.614
She just needs you to love her
and support her.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.968
So stop trying to fix her.

32:53.864 --> 32:55.621
Yeah.

32:55.716 --> 32:57.307
You're right, it's Maddie.

32:57.534 --> 33:02.037
She'll be fine.

33:02.055 --> 33:04.372
If you think this is great...

33:04.466 --> 33:07.067
wait till I show you the ocean.

33:08.136 --> 33:10.529
(Jee-Yun cooing)

33:17.830 --> 33:20.831
(gasping)

33:20.982 --> 33:22.407
(crying)

33:22.559 --> 33:24.835
Are you okay?

33:25.062 --> 33:27.337
(panting)

33:29.066 --> 33:31.299
Okay, okay.
(shushing)

33:33.012 --> 33:35.495
I'm so sorry.

33:35.589 --> 33:38.056
I'm so sorry.
(crying)

33:44.839 --> 33:45.764
So she's okay?

33:45.858 --> 33:48.191
Lungs seem clear.
02 levels look good.

33:48.343 --> 33:50.027
I don't think
she inhaled any water.

33:50.178 --> 33:51.361
And what about her head?

33:51.513 --> 33:52.696
CT doesn't show any injury

33:52.847 --> 33:54.514
and I checked her head twice--
no sign of a bump.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.774
Thank God.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.517
Now, obviously, I want you
to keep an eye on her.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.036
If there's any change
in her breathing pattern,

33:59.187 --> 34:00.428
if she starts coughing

34:00.447 --> 34:02.021
or vomiting,
bring her back immediately.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.856
-I will.
-But...

34:03.876 --> 34:06.025
I think she's gonna be fine.

34:06.119 --> 34:07.936
How are you doing?

34:07.954 --> 34:09.362
Shaky.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.273
Just feel like
the adrenaline's wearing off.

34:11.291 --> 34:13.441
Then you should get her home.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.277
I bet you both could use
a good night's sleep.

34:15.295 --> 34:17.596
I'll have the nurse
have you discharged.

34:18.799 --> 34:20.557
Thank you.

34:21.451 --> 34:23.209
For everything.
It's been

34:23.228 --> 34:25.378
a pretty terrifying night
so far.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.139
Well, probably not
the last you'll experience

34:28.233 --> 34:30.308
before she makes it
to adulthood.

34:30.460 --> 34:32.294
And I speak from experience.

34:32.312 --> 34:33.978
I feel like I age
a decade every time

34:34.073 --> 34:35.989
one of my kids has an accident.

34:43.473 --> 34:45.373
♪ ♪

34:51.982 --> 34:54.382

34:57.096 --> 34:59.429
How was your day four?

34:59.581 --> 35:02.490
Or are we in day five
of this craziness?

35:02.509 --> 35:04.434
Well, five, I think.

35:04.661 --> 35:06.328
You know, lions, tigers...

35:06.346 --> 35:08.254

35:10.425 --> 35:12.109

35:19.192 --> 35:20.600
<i> Yeah? How so?</i>

35:21.361 --> 35:24.512
I am sitting outside
this woman's home,

35:24.531 --> 35:26.865
waiting for Jeffery Hudson
to make a move.

35:27.017 --> 35:29.701
And yet I haven't warned her.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.277
Or the other victims.

35:31.371 --> 35:33.613
<i> They're not</i>
<i> helpless bait, Athena.</i>

35:33.707 --> 35:34.873
They are protected because

35:35.025 --> 35:36.374
you are there
looking out for them.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.526
That man stood in court
the other day

35:38.545 --> 35:40.786
called me a rogue cop.

35:40.881 --> 35:42.788
Here I am,

35:42.883 --> 35:44.382
fulfilling the prophecy.

35:44.534 --> 35:45.700
<i> You are doing your job, and</i>

Is it bad that I hope he does?

I hope that for you too, baby.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.302
<i> Bobby Nash.</i>

35:56.321 --> 35:59.305
Did you just say you hoped
I come face to face

35:59.324 --> 36:02.325
with a dangerous
escaped fugitive tonight?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.444
I believe I did.

36:04.554 --> 36:07.146
Well, that might be
the sweetest thing

36:07.166 --> 36:08.481
you have ever said to me.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.149
<i> I want you to be the one</i>
<i> who gets him.</i>

36:10.243 --> 36:12.243
Except this time,
don't shoot him in the leg.

36:12.396 --> 36:14.078
<i> Oh, I'm gonna aim higher</i>

36:14.231 --> 36:16.080
and empty the clip.

36:16.233 --> 36:18.066
Believe that.

36:18.084 --> 36:19.734
Got to call you back.

36:19.753 --> 36:23.071
I just got some very esteemed
reinforcements.

36:23.089 --> 36:25.423
<i> Be safe.</i>

36:25.517 --> 36:27.425
Well, this might be
an LAPD first.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.002
Don't think I've ever seen
a captain on a stakeout.

36:30.096 --> 36:33.005
That's why I left my bars
at the station.

36:33.099 --> 36:34.249
Captain,
what are you doing here?

36:34.267 --> 36:36.359
Eh, you know, one way or another

36:36.511 --> 36:40.255
Hudson is responsible
for slicing up one of my guys

36:40.273 --> 36:42.682
and putting him
on life support, so...

36:42.701 --> 36:45.777
at this point, it's personal.

36:45.929 --> 36:47.537
(chuckles)

36:47.689 --> 36:49.264
So I'm relieving you.

36:49.357 --> 36:50.932
(exhales)

36:51.025 --> 36:52.600
Respectfully, Captain...

36:52.619 --> 36:55.027
thanks but no thanks.
I'm not leaving.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.713
Yes, you are.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.440
Ransone is awake.

36:58.458 --> 37:01.051
And he's asking for you again.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.037
We were able to extubate him
a few hours ago,

37:05.131 --> 37:06.798
but he hasn't been able
to speak.

37:06.950 --> 37:09.133
He's still got the pen and
paper, though, which tells me

37:09.228 --> 37:11.210
the stroke hasn't
significantly impaired

37:11.230 --> 37:14.439
-his cognitive abilities.
-That is good news.

37:23.149 --> 37:26.301
I heard you were looking for me.

37:26.394 --> 37:28.470
(sobs)

37:28.488 --> 37:30.154
(grunting)

37:30.249 --> 37:33.399
You save your strength, Lou.

37:33.493 --> 37:35.085
But it is...

37:35.312 --> 37:37.545
damn good to see you too.

37:47.657 --> 37:49.157
Yeah, we found her dead.

37:49.175 --> 37:51.417
Gunshot wound.
Probably...

37:51.436 --> 37:53.478
two days old.

37:59.594 --> 38:01.669
I figured it.

38:01.688 --> 38:05.365
I just put the pieces together
a little too late.

38:08.028 --> 38:11.288
I'm so sorry
I wasn't there, Lou.

38:19.706 --> 38:21.539
In the wind.

38:21.691 --> 38:23.591
Again.

38:26.621 --> 38:29.213
More like some hunches.

38:29.366 --> 38:31.957
Maynard thinks
he's probably long gone by now,

38:32.052 --> 38:34.394
but I'm not so sure of that.

38:40.226 --> 38:43.153
I think that's our best chance
of catching him.

38:43.304 --> 38:45.563
We have
surveillance units posted

38:45.715 --> 38:47.824
at all the victims' houses.

38:47.975 --> 38:49.642
And we're waiting for him.

38:49.736 --> 38:51.494
(grunting)

38:57.652 --> 39:00.086
My house? What about it?

39:01.414 --> 39:04.698
No, no, it's okay, Lou,
it's okay.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.250
You're...

39:06.403 --> 39:07.844
victim...

39:08.071 --> 39:09.679
too.

39:15.169 --> 39:17.503
These people aren't leaving.

39:17.597 --> 39:18.855
(groans)

39:19.082 --> 39:20.582
I should've let Harry

39:20.600 --> 39:22.692
-charge them by the hour.
-(chuckles)

39:22.844 --> 39:26.254
Guess you're regretting
that "we're supposed to help

39:26.272 --> 39:28.106
our neighbors
in their time of need" speech?

39:28.200 --> 39:29.366
Yeah, well,
technically, they're not

39:29.517 --> 39:31.092
-my neighbors anymore.
-Ooh.

39:31.185 --> 39:33.018
-Hmm?
-(laughs)

39:33.113 --> 39:35.455
(indistinct chatter)

39:37.042 --> 39:39.709
No. Mom has to work
until the emergency's over.

39:39.936 --> 39:41.769
That's too bad.

39:41.788 --> 39:44.381
I was really hoping to see her.

39:44.532 --> 39:46.424
(chuckles softly)

39:53.558 --> 39:55.783
(phone ringing)

39:55.802 --> 39:57.376
Athena?

39:57.396 --> 39:59.062
Bobby, I'm on my way
to the house,

39:59.231 --> 40:01.714
but I'm still ten minutes out.
Can you get there before me?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.625
<i> Well, I can try.</i>
<i> Traffic is</i>

40:03.643 --> 40:05.384
<i> pretty clogged here</i>
<i> by the firehouse.</i>

40:05.404 --> 40:06.903
Aren't Michael and David there
with Harry?

40:07.054 --> 40:07.979
<i> They're not picking up.</i>

40:08.131 --> 40:09.981
Bobby...

40:10.133 --> 40:12.150
I was so worried about
Jeffery Hudson going after

40:12.244 --> 40:13.985
one of his victims
that I forgot...

40:14.137 --> 40:16.471
You're one of them, too.

40:16.489 --> 40:17.580
I'm on my way.

40:17.732 --> 40:19.082
-Chim.
-What's up, Bobby?

40:19.233 --> 40:20.733
Here, you're in charge.
I'm taking the captain's truck.

40:20.827 --> 40:21.993
I will explain later.

40:22.145 --> 40:23.661
What?
What's going on?

40:23.813 --> 40:26.047
(engine starts)

40:28.168 --> 40:29.834
-(phone ringing)
-Elaine, I'm almost home.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.319
<i> I'm five minutes away.</i>

40:31.337 --> 40:32.929
And I managed to get
some units out there.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.246
Do not go in there alone.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.433
-I don't think that's an option.
<i> -Athena!</i>

40:36.584 --> 40:38.268
The last time you went in
without backup,

40:38.419 --> 40:39.510
it did not end well.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.996
People keep talking to me
about the last time.

40:42.015 --> 40:46.317
I no longer have the luxury
to dwell on that.

41:06.873 --> 41:10.049
Michael?
You here?

41:18.702 --> 41:20.727
(glass breaks in distance)

41:37.537 --> 41:39.645
-Hands up! Don't move!
-No, no, no! Athena, it's me!

41:39.664 --> 41:42.314
-It's me, it's me, it's me!
-Michael, what the hell?!

41:42.408 --> 41:45.059
-I almost shot you!
-Yeah, I can see that.

41:45.152 --> 41:46.652
Now, what the hell is going on?

41:46.671 --> 41:48.246
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

41:48.398 --> 41:50.656
Where is everyone?
Why is the house so dark?

41:50.675 --> 41:53.251
-I thought you had people here.
-The generator went out.

41:53.403 --> 41:55.327
Everybody left.
(chuckles)

41:55.421 --> 41:57.830
Goes to show you
who your friends are, right?

41:58.742 --> 42:01.075
-Ah! And let there be light.
-(exhales)

42:01.094 --> 42:03.019
Oh good. We're back.

42:03.170 --> 42:04.854
Wait, did it just out of gas?

42:05.081 --> 42:06.430
No, it was unplugged.

42:06.583 --> 42:09.508
Someone must have kicked out
a plug by accident.

42:09.602 --> 42:11.176
MAYNARD:
Athena?

42:11.196 --> 42:12.937
-Everything okay?
-He's not here.

42:13.089 --> 42:14.589
Who's not here?

42:14.607 --> 42:17.200
Would somebody mind telling me
what in the hell is going on?

42:17.427 --> 42:18.868
Michael.

42:19.095 --> 42:20.111
Where's Harry?

42:20.205 --> 42:21.779
Uh, he was just here.

42:21.931 --> 42:23.706
Uh, there's his phone.

42:29.289 --> 42:32.048
(gasps)

42:36.963 --> 42:39.556
(indistinct radio chatter)

42:44.621 --> 42:46.378
Residents only.

42:46.398 --> 42:49.274
You're gonna have to turn
around or show some ID.

42:50.977 --> 42:52.293
Sorry about that, Detective.

42:52.312 --> 42:54.128
We've had some reports
of break-ins.

42:54.147 --> 42:56.739
Can never be too careful.
