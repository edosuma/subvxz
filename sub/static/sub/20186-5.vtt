00:27.704 --> 00:29.271
Found a phone!

00:30.458 --> 00:33.170
It looks like it's from
1967, but I think it'll work.

00:33.195 --> 00:34.857
Just a sec, Jimmy.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.730
Excellent. Thank you
for being so careful.

00:37.766 --> 00:39.132
- Sir.
- Hmm?

00:39.167 --> 00:41.100
- We have to get in your attic.
- For what?

00:41.136 --> 00:42.420
Oh, the hook-up.

00:42.445 --> 00:43.611
Oh, no. That's all right. Don't bother.

00:43.636 --> 00:44.982
Oh, it won't take 20 minutes.

00:45.007 --> 00:46.575
Plus, you really can't
use it if I don't do it.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.366
No, it's all right. We're not gonna...

00:48.402 --> 00:49.768
Uh, when you're done here,

00:49.803 --> 00:51.469
would you get some more
lamps in the garage?

00:51.505 --> 00:52.737
Thanks.

00:54.174 --> 00:55.607
- So, we got a phone.
- Yeah.

00:55.642 --> 00:56.832
The yard's half-mowed.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.977
Uh, the sockets and
stuff are looking a-ok.

00:59.012 --> 01:01.079
I'm gonna check again just to make sure.

01:01.114 --> 01:02.380
We're almost there.

01:02.416 --> 01:03.448
Good. Good.

01:03.483 --> 01:05.917
Um, what do you think?

01:05.953 --> 01:08.286
On? Off?

01:08.322 --> 01:11.323
Ohh. I think... off.

01:11.358 --> 01:14.125
Yeah. You're right. Off it is.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.690
- Chuck.
- Hmm?

01:15.715 --> 01:17.463
You sure this is the right play?

01:17.488 --> 01:18.797
I mean, in my experience,

01:18.832 --> 01:22.457
the bigger the lie, the
harder it can be to dig out.

01:22.888 --> 01:25.457
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

01:29.239 --> 01:31.076
Hey, guys, think we're
set with the lamps.

01:31.111 --> 01:34.412
Uh, could someone give me a
hand with this phone? Gracias.

02:29.684 --> 02:30.976
Mmm.

02:49.222 --> 02:50.722
It's open!

02:59.740 --> 03:01.073
Rebecca.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.134
- Chuck.
- You look lovely.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.336
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- And you.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.520
- Oh.
- Hey,

03:07.545 --> 03:09.254
what's with the candles?

03:09.279 --> 03:10.598
Why you sittin' here in the dark?

03:10.623 --> 03:12.177
Ye, I was wondering the same thing.

03:12.212 --> 03:15.487
Oh, my God, the afternoon I've had.

03:15.512 --> 03:17.682
Two hours ago, I take the sea bass out.

03:17.707 --> 03:20.385
No sooner is it prepped and resting

03:20.410 --> 03:22.821
then, boom... power goes down.

03:22.856 --> 03:25.119
I get on the phone to the city.

03:25.144 --> 03:26.543
To make a long story short,

03:26.568 --> 03:29.761
those bozos at PNM mixed up my payment.

03:29.796 --> 03:32.664
The deadbeat at 512 San Cristobal

03:32.699 --> 03:34.432
hasn't been paying his bills.

03:34.468 --> 03:36.034
And, of course, I'm...

03:36.069 --> 03:38.862
- 215. Mm-hmm. Mm.
- 215, exactly.

03:38.887 --> 03:41.005
They say they'll have
it on again by tomorrow.

03:41.041 --> 03:44.442
In the meantime, I borrowed some
camping gear from my neighbors.

03:44.478 --> 03:46.881
Hence, the rustic flair.

03:46.906 --> 03:48.113
- Jeez.
- Oh, yeah.

03:48.148 --> 03:49.547
So, what do we do?

03:49.583 --> 03:51.763
Uh, get out of here
and go to a restaurant?

03:51.788 --> 03:54.378
We could hit Seasons. Your treat.

03:54.403 --> 03:56.701
We could, yeah.

03:56.726 --> 03:59.090
But, um, you know,
dinner's almost ready.

03:59.126 --> 04:01.359
And the fish... I would have
just had to throw it out.

04:01.394 --> 04:03.027
All I have to do is toss it in a pan.

04:03.063 --> 04:04.763
How about we just rough it?

04:04.798 --> 04:06.097
Huh? You okay with that?

04:06.133 --> 04:07.899
Uh, um...

04:07.934 --> 04:10.969
Well... why not? It'll be fun.

04:11.004 --> 04:13.772
We'll do an haute-cuisine camp-out.

04:13.807 --> 04:16.565
Great! Then it's settled.
Let me take that. Take your...

04:16.591 --> 04:17.837
- Oh, yeah, here. Oh, thank you.
- Here, I'll take that.

04:17.862 --> 04:19.495
Mm-hmm.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.823
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.433
Oh, my God.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.825
I can't eat another bite.

04:29.756 --> 04:32.390
Cheers to the Galloping Gourmet.

04:32.415 --> 04:33.832
- Mm!
- Ah.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.956
Yeah.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.491
Mm.

04:37.549 --> 04:39.082
The Calvados is perfect.

04:39.107 --> 04:41.162
Mm. You always liked it.

04:41.505 --> 04:42.833
Here.

04:42.858 --> 04:44.247
Uh, um...

04:44.272 --> 04:45.341
- Let me get this.
- No, no, Jimmy.

04:45.366 --> 04:46.691
- You don't have to.
- No, least I can do...

04:46.716 --> 04:48.401
- ... is the dishes.
- Oh.

04:48.426 --> 04:49.996
Thank you.

04:50.021 --> 04:51.858
Thanks, Jimmy.

04:55.341 --> 04:57.802
This turned out better than I thought.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.925
Uh, I'm so... sorry about the lights.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.723
Oh, it's nice. Atmospheric.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.256
I mean, I still can't get
over Jimmy being a lawyer.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.977
Neither can I.

05:10.002 --> 05:12.104
He's got his own shingle
out and everything.

05:12.129 --> 05:13.815
I mean, a real, responsible citizen.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.630
I mean, who woulda thought?

05:15.665 --> 05:16.922
Yeah.

05:18.868 --> 05:20.367
Mm.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.337
This place is the same.

05:23.373 --> 05:25.439
I mean, I-I would've thought you'd...

05:27.369 --> 05:29.008
change things up.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.499
Move things around.

05:30.524 --> 05:33.225
You've got great taste.
And if it ain't broke...

05:34.352 --> 05:35.816
How's the tour going?

05:35.852 --> 05:36.969
It's good. Good.

05:36.994 --> 05:38.794
- Um, the Far East this fall.
- Oh.

05:38.819 --> 05:41.132
Uh, China, South Korea, and Vietnam.

05:41.157 --> 05:43.004
- That's gonna be exciting.
- Yeah.

05:43.029 --> 05:45.480
And then, um, after Santa Fe this week,

05:45.505 --> 05:48.347
- uh, we're back to Central Europe.
- And it's good?

05:48.433 --> 05:50.166
- Well, it's a lot of hotels.
- Yeah.

05:50.212 --> 05:52.412
I mean, in Budapest,
I think I saw mostly

05:52.447 --> 05:55.495
the inside of the concert
hall and the Marriott.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.184
But, you know, I shouldn't complain.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.214
You're not complaining.
You're observing.

06:04.559 --> 06:06.459
Did you finally get to see Salzburg?

06:06.495 --> 06:09.168
Not yet, but next month, after Vienna.

06:09.246 --> 06:11.765
Do you remember when we
tried to go to Salzburg?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.200
And that crazy old
lady on the scooter...

06:14.227 --> 06:16.995
- Oh, yes! Yes!
- ... chased us out of the train station.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.684
Yeah! And then, um...

06:18.709 --> 06:20.221
and then we went and got, uh,

06:20.246 --> 06:23.807
it was a-a-a raspberry
Linzer torte in Innsbruck?

06:23.832 --> 06:25.573
- Mm.
- To make ourselves feel better?

06:25.598 --> 06:27.781
Mm. You said, "We'll never finish this!"

06:27.816 --> 06:28.989
And then we did.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.821
So, what's after Asia? Any
plans for a stateside tour?

06:34.871 --> 06:37.270
Oh, you know, hopefully next year.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.126
You know, maybe a residency.
Oh, that would be sweet.

06:40.162 --> 06:41.561
I mean, you know, I like the buses

06:41.596 --> 06:43.653
and trains and planes fine,

06:43.678 --> 06:45.200
but I, um...

06:45.754 --> 06:49.348
I miss having one...
one place to hang my hat.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.177
Oh, God!

06:57.212 --> 06:59.813
I'm sorry. I-I-I hate that thing.

06:59.848 --> 07:02.983
I feel like I'm on a leash. Ugh!

07:03.614 --> 07:05.001
I'm sorry.

07:08.707 --> 07:10.807
Oh. Oh, it's my conductor.

07:10.832 --> 07:13.659
Um, I have to take this. I'm sorry.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.161
H-Hi, Andre.

07:15.197 --> 07:17.653
No, I'm just at dinner. What's up?

07:18.395 --> 07:19.799
Well, I can do that at rehearsal.

07:19.835 --> 07:21.995
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

07:22.020 --> 07:25.305
No, I-I know that they're
coming in late on bar 16.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.841
Y-Yeah. Got it. Got it.

07:27.876 --> 07:29.676
I will make sure that...

07:29.711 --> 07:31.511
Uh, c-c-can you hold on a second?

07:31.546 --> 07:33.243
Let me just get a pen.

07:33.268 --> 07:34.697
Mm-hmm.

07:35.658 --> 07:37.627
Yeah. No, I-I...

07:38.420 --> 07:40.453
Yeah, hold on one second.

07:40.489 --> 07:42.555
Yeah, I can do it... I
mean, whatever you need.

07:42.591 --> 07:44.157
Mm-hmm. Okay.

07:44.192 --> 07:45.392
All right, shoot.

07:46.695 --> 07:48.628
Okay...

07:50.731 --> 07:51.796
Chuck?

07:52.346 --> 07:53.400
I'm all right.

07:53.435 --> 07:56.469
Well, do you want me to
rehearse the cellists separately?

07:56.505 --> 07:57.971
Rebecca. Rebecca.

08:01.009 --> 08:03.910
Well, no, it's not just
him. It's the whole section.

08:03.945 --> 08:05.588
Rebecca!

08:05.619 --> 08:06.846
Uh, no.

08:06.882 --> 08:08.869
T-That's fine.

08:08.894 --> 08:10.517
Yeah.

08:10.552 --> 08:12.713
Chuck, what the hell?!

08:15.749 --> 08:17.223
Andre?

08:17.259 --> 08:19.559
I-I-I have to... I'll
have to call you back.

08:19.594 --> 08:21.070
I'm sorry.

08:22.764 --> 08:25.134
What is your problem?

08:27.584 --> 08:29.418
Say something.

08:33.570 --> 08:35.775
It is incredibly bad manners

08:35.811 --> 08:38.711
to answer a cellphone in company.

08:38.746 --> 08:40.732
It's very rude.

08:40.756 --> 08:43.928
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

08:43.953 --> 08:46.944
I-I didn't know that you felt that way.

08:46.969 --> 08:50.170
I... didn't mean to offend you, Chuck.

08:50.205 --> 08:52.339
I-I may have overreacted.

08:52.374 --> 08:54.421
- That was very abrupt. Uh..
- No.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.281
I understand.

08:58.484 --> 08:59.835
Uh...

09:00.624 --> 09:02.382
It's getting late.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.917
Thank you for a lovely dinner,

09:03.952 --> 09:06.320
but I should be getting
back to the hotel.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.254
Just gimme a minute, and we can...

09:08.290 --> 09:10.423
No. Uh, um, I'll just get a cab.

09:10.459 --> 09:11.625
I don't want to put you out
any more than I already...

09:11.650 --> 09:13.627
- Please, let me.
- No, really.

09:13.662 --> 09:15.662
A cab is the easiest.

09:17.562 --> 09:19.245
You gotta do somethin'.

09:19.277 --> 09:21.036
Y-You can't let her leave like this.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.536
- Just tell her what's going on.
- No. No.

09:23.572 --> 09:25.138
She'll understand.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.774
She'll... Would you rather
she think you're a raging prick

09:27.809 --> 09:29.190
than know the truth?

09:29.215 --> 09:30.426
No.

09:31.002 --> 09:32.812
Look, if you won't
tell her, then I will.

09:32.848 --> 09:34.714
No, no. No!

09:34.750 --> 09:36.395
You will not tell her.

09:36.985 --> 09:40.137
You... will not tell her.

09:40.895 --> 09:42.489
All right.

09:43.152 --> 09:45.612
Hi, Andre. Yes, I'm sorry about that.

09:45.637 --> 09:47.470
I dropped the phone.

09:57.114 --> 10:01.636
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

10:21.536 --> 10:23.075
Jesus. What're you doing, man?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.989
There's barely any oxygen in that bag.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.308
- You're suffocating her!
- "Her"?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.418
Yeah, just because you
don't see swingin' dicks

10:29.443 --> 10:32.377
doesn't mean you can't tell
a boy fish from a girl fish.

10:32.838 --> 10:33.981
Oh, yeah, see.

10:34.006 --> 10:35.942
Now I can see the lipstick.

10:36.137 --> 10:39.484
This is a living creature.
It's not a piece of furniture.

10:39.509 --> 10:41.476
So, after this, you take her home.

10:41.501 --> 10:44.008
You put her in a big
bowl, at least a gallon.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.961
Get a good bubbler,

10:45.986 --> 10:47.531
maybe a plecostomus.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.226
And don't feed her too much.

10:49.251 --> 10:50.388
People get fat.

10:50.413 --> 10:52.614
Fish, they drown in leftover food.

10:52.639 --> 10:54.606
All right already, Jacques Cousteau.

10:54.641 --> 10:55.974
Point made.

10:56.009 --> 10:57.342
Good.

11:00.185 --> 11:02.948
I'm guessing our friend
didn't refer you to me

11:02.983 --> 11:05.545
to get ichthyological advice.

11:06.076 --> 11:08.954
I'm looking for someone
with a light touch.

11:08.989 --> 11:12.129
I'm not talking some teenager
taking a five-finger discount

11:12.154 --> 11:13.658
on string cheese at the Stop 'N' Shop.

11:13.683 --> 11:16.028
I need highly skilled,

11:16.053 --> 11:18.619
high-end, discreet.

11:18.665 --> 11:20.215
A real pro.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.551
You gotta fit him in a tight space?

11:23.810 --> 11:25.577
I don't think so.

11:27.674 --> 11:29.777
I got just the guy, then.

11:47.826 --> 11:49.861
That's why I say golfing
is a contact sport.

11:52.199 --> 11:55.200
Great job, Ms. Wexler. Very refreshing.

11:55.235 --> 11:58.170
Believe me, uh, we're happy
to get this one off the docket.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.904
Not as happy as we are.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.406
Again, great job.

12:01.441 --> 12:03.389
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

12:07.414 --> 12:10.015
Ladies, dinner's on me.

12:11.132 --> 12:13.618
Kim, I knew you were good, but
I didn't know you were this good.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.954
Oh, I'm glad you're happy.

12:15.989 --> 12:17.335
We couldn't have done it without you.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.819
And I hope you realize this means

12:18.844 --> 12:20.859
a whole lot a work comin' your way.

12:20.894 --> 12:23.607
Oh, that's... that's great.

12:24.464 --> 12:26.725
Well, you don't sound like it's great.

12:28.183 --> 12:29.785
I hate to be a buzzkill, but...

12:29.810 --> 12:32.704
there is something you need to
hear before we get any deeper in.

12:32.739 --> 12:36.074
It's about your former
attorney, Charles McGill.

12:36.101 --> 12:37.402
What about him?

12:37.427 --> 12:40.342
Charles has been making
some very ugly allegations

12:40.367 --> 12:42.349
about his brother, Jimmy,

12:42.396 --> 12:44.783
with whom I happen to
share an office space.

12:44.818 --> 12:47.857
Allegations? Of what?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.082
Charles thinks that Jimmy

12:51.107 --> 12:52.848
somehow took control of your documents

12:52.873 --> 12:54.209
while he was working
on them at his home.

12:54.234 --> 12:56.995
He believes Jimmy transposed
the address numbers.

12:57.030 --> 12:59.520
Transposed the numbers?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.900
How would he even do that?

13:02.388 --> 13:05.535
Charles contends that
Jimmy took the documents

13:05.560 --> 13:06.805
pertaining to the Rosella branch

13:06.840 --> 13:09.254
and, while Charles was indisposed,

13:09.279 --> 13:11.676
photocopied and doctored them.

13:11.966 --> 13:14.679
That's pretty baroque.

13:14.715 --> 13:16.147
The important thing here

13:16.183 --> 13:18.637
is I think it could make
some noise in public.

13:18.662 --> 13:19.951
Soon.

13:19.986 --> 13:21.912
I wanted to tell you this in
the spirit of full disclosure.

13:21.937 --> 13:24.365
I thought it was better
if you heard it from me.

13:26.586 --> 13:29.791
If you have any reservations
at this point, or...

13:29.816 --> 13:32.630
if you are not comfortable
staying with me,

13:32.666 --> 13:34.667
we can discuss options.

13:40.324 --> 13:41.970
If there's one thing I cannot abide,

13:41.995 --> 13:44.806
it's a man who won't
own up to his mistakes.

13:44.973 --> 13:47.868
Now, whatever mud McGill is slinging

13:47.893 --> 13:50.322
he's not gonna screw
me out of the best...

13:50.347 --> 13:53.048
outside counsel I've ever had.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.287
That's...

13:56.323 --> 13:57.939
I'm so glad to hear that.

13:57.964 --> 14:00.423
We appreciate the heads-up, but
you can call this baby put to bed.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.293
Now the most important thing... dinner.

14:02.329 --> 14:04.337
7:00 good for you?

14:04.362 --> 14:06.331
- Uh, works for me.
- Great.

14:06.366 --> 14:07.899
We'll talk strategy...

14:07.934 --> 14:10.609
We move on Colorado or Utah first?

14:10.634 --> 14:12.275
See ya at 7:00.

14:12.907 --> 14:14.736
This McGill thing.

14:14.761 --> 14:17.868
You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?

14:18.595 --> 14:19.978
I am.

14:20.352 --> 14:23.462
Mesa Verde isn't involved
in any way, shape, or form.

14:25.011 --> 14:27.095
Okay. Good.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.154
Then, I'll see you tonight.

14:29.189 --> 14:31.134
Okay, great. See you then.

14:47.942 --> 14:49.466
Okay, this is it.

14:49.491 --> 14:52.206
We can run without lights and mics.

14:52.231 --> 14:53.464
We'll collect all cellphones

14:53.489 --> 14:55.346
and hold them for the
duration of your testimony.

14:55.382 --> 14:57.549
The, uh, court reporter,
would it be possible

14:57.584 --> 14:59.951
to move him or her farther
from the witness stand?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.714
Um, yeah, I think we can arrange

15:01.739 --> 15:03.677
having them in the back of the court.

15:04.724 --> 15:07.091
I'm sorry. There's nothing I
can do about the exit signs.

15:07.127 --> 15:08.293
It's code.

15:08.328 --> 15:11.062
I appreciate all
you're doing. Thank you.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.222
Mr. Alley, I wonder if
you'd give us a moment.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.950
I'd like to go over
something with my colleague.

15:16.975 --> 15:19.286
No problem. I'll be
outside when you're ready.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.210
Howard?

15:23.515 --> 15:25.410
How you feeling, Chuck?

15:26.501 --> 15:29.447
- I'll muddle through.
- Because this is a lot to ask.

15:29.483 --> 15:32.450
And if you're not up to it...
just throwing this out there...

15:32.486 --> 15:34.118
maybe you don't need to testify at all.

15:34.154 --> 15:35.265
No, I do.

15:35.290 --> 15:37.648
I'm the only person who
can adequately explain

15:37.673 --> 15:39.056
the context of that tape.

15:39.081 --> 15:41.570
Otherwise, the defense'll
tear it to shreds.

15:41.595 --> 15:43.228
It's already a solid case.

15:43.263 --> 15:46.212
We have Jimmy's statement from
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.833
There's my testimony
and the private eye's.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.747
Maybe there's no need to put you
through the wringer like this.

15:52.772 --> 15:55.807
This isn't about me or my health.

15:55.842 --> 15:57.970
This is about PR.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.458
We lost a client.

16:00.861 --> 16:04.616
That happened because, while
you were... incapacitated,

16:04.651 --> 16:06.173
your brother accessed documents

16:06.198 --> 16:08.994
that should have been secured at HHM.

16:09.775 --> 16:12.845
What Jimmy did is unconscionable, yes...

16:13.017 --> 16:16.594
but one of my jobs is to
safeguard the firm's reputation.

16:16.630 --> 16:19.228
This is not the time to
worry about how we look.

16:19.253 --> 16:22.133
This is about what's
right and what's wrong.

16:22.168 --> 16:24.335
I'm not gonna risk Jimmy getting, what?

16:24.371 --> 16:27.539
A year's suspension? Maybe two?

16:27.574 --> 16:31.509
He deserves disbarment,
not some slap on the wrist.

16:31.564 --> 16:34.955
No, Howard. There's
only one way forward.

16:35.849 --> 16:39.134
Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall.

16:41.345 --> 16:43.855
Sorry to keep you
waiting. This'll do nicely.

16:44.054 --> 16:46.555
Please extend my thanks to the
Committee for their flexibility.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.646
Good morning. I'm Robert
Alley for the State Bar.

16:53.374 --> 16:55.079
In the matter of James M. McGill,

16:55.104 --> 16:57.688
the State Bar intends to
prove the following violations

16:57.713 --> 16:59.679
of the Ethical Code.

16:59.725 --> 17:02.306
16-102...

17:02.331 --> 17:05.494
engaging in conduct a
lawyer knows is criminal.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.415
Mr. McGill certainly knew that
breaking down his brother's door

17:08.440 --> 17:10.607
was criminal behavior.

17:10.825 --> 17:13.590
16-804...

17:13.616 --> 17:15.895
committing a criminal act
that reflects adversely

17:15.920 --> 17:20.128
on the lawyer's honesty or
trustworthiness as a lawyer.

17:20.746 --> 17:22.268
Any reasonable person would agree

17:22.303 --> 17:24.804
that assaulting another
lawyer in his own home

17:24.839 --> 17:28.442
reflects badly on Mr. McGill's
fitness as an attorney.

17:29.844 --> 17:32.091
16-304...

17:32.116 --> 17:34.680
unlawfully altering, destroying,

17:34.716 --> 17:38.818
or concealing material having
potential evidentiary value.

17:38.853 --> 17:41.020
Mr. McGill broke into his brother's home

17:41.045 --> 17:42.888
and destroyed an audiocassette

17:42.924 --> 17:45.081
which contained a
recording of a conversation

17:45.106 --> 17:48.556
between himself and his
brother, Charles McGill.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.409
We will show that this
recording was evidence

17:50.434 --> 17:52.510
in an ongoing legal case.

17:53.568 --> 17:54.834
The State Bar believes that,

17:54.859 --> 17:56.869
once we have presented the facts,

17:56.905 --> 17:59.605
the Committee will agree
that disbarment is warranted

17:59.641 --> 18:01.623
for James McGill.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.005
Thank you very much.

18:04.724 --> 18:06.612
Thank you, Mr. Alley.

18:06.637 --> 18:08.302
Ms. Wexler?

18:13.310 --> 18:15.381
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

18:16.124 --> 18:17.552
Good morning.

18:17.577 --> 18:20.115
I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel
with James McGill,

18:20.140 --> 18:21.394
for the defense.

18:21.429 --> 18:25.027
You've already read Mr. McGill's
Pre-Prosecution Statement.

18:25.052 --> 18:28.000
We don't dispute he broke
into his brother's house,

18:28.036 --> 18:30.029
an act he regrets...

18:30.711 --> 18:32.138
deeply.

18:32.173 --> 18:34.740
But there is another side to this story.

18:34.776 --> 18:37.647
One not about calculation...

18:37.672 --> 18:40.373
or ill intent,

18:40.682 --> 18:43.015
but about about two brothers,

18:43.365 --> 18:46.795
whose relationship,
after years of strain,

18:47.330 --> 18:48.797
finally broke.

18:50.818 --> 18:53.826
We believe that, after you
have the complete picture,

18:53.861 --> 18:56.599
you'll understand
James McGill is an asset

18:56.631 --> 18:58.395
to our legal community.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.912
And he should remain a full
member of it in good standing.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.849
Thank you.

19:06.341 --> 19:08.138
Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.217
Okay, if, uh, everyone's ready to...

19:15.242 --> 19:17.068
begin testimony...

19:17.467 --> 19:19.285
Mr. Alley, call your witness.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.356
Bang! Bang! Bang!

19:21.381 --> 19:22.788
Then he kicked down the door.

19:22.824 --> 19:25.222
Jimmy was very agitated.
He was shouting.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.047
He demanded Charles turn over

19:27.072 --> 19:29.057
- the evidence he'd been collecting...
- Objection.

19:29.104 --> 19:32.399
We haven't established the
tape is evidence of anything.

19:32.424 --> 19:34.734
The defense has only acknowledged
it as a piece of property.

19:34.769 --> 19:36.776
Uh, allow me to rephrase.

19:37.739 --> 19:41.073
Jimmy demanded an audiocassette
in Charles' possession,

19:41.109 --> 19:42.508
which Jimmy proceeded,

19:42.543 --> 19:45.344
with the help of an
iron fireplace implement,

19:45.380 --> 19:47.759
to pry from Charles' desk.

19:47.784 --> 19:49.649
He then broke the cassette into pieces

19:49.674 --> 19:51.817
and went on to confront his brother.

19:51.853 --> 19:54.820
What happened after the
defendant smashed this tape?

19:54.856 --> 19:56.255
Mr. Brightbill and I...

19:56.290 --> 19:58.557
That's the private
investigator that Charles hired?

19:58.593 --> 20:00.326
That's correct.

20:00.361 --> 20:03.996
He and I were concerned that
Jimmy might strike his brother.

20:04.418 --> 20:06.236
So that's when we stepped in.

20:06.261 --> 20:08.067
- Thank you, Mr. Hamlin.
- Certainly.

20:08.102 --> 20:09.682
Nothing further at this time.

20:09.707 --> 20:11.537
Ms. Wexler?

20:12.874 --> 20:14.730
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

20:22.332 --> 20:26.455
You testified you've known
my client for some time.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.090
How long exactly?

20:28.115 --> 20:30.063
Nearly 10 years.

20:30.088 --> 20:32.080
How did you come to know him?

20:32.105 --> 20:35.027
His brother asked to hire him
in the mail-room at our firm.

20:35.063 --> 20:36.980
- And you did.
- Yes.

20:37.732 --> 20:39.777
What was your opinion of him then?

20:40.542 --> 20:42.957
I thought...

20:44.277 --> 20:46.439
he had a lot of get-up-and-go.

20:46.474 --> 20:47.707
He was a hard worker.

20:47.732 --> 20:50.011
You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

20:51.112 --> 20:52.378
"Charlie Hustle."

20:52.413 --> 20:54.019
"Charlie Hustle."

20:54.363 --> 20:56.982
How'd you feel when you found
out he'd become a lawyer?

20:57.018 --> 20:58.250
Surprised.

20:58.286 --> 21:00.052
He'd put himself through law school

21:00.088 --> 21:02.752
and taken the Bar Exam without
telling any of the partners.

21:02.777 --> 21:03.889
Even Charles.

21:03.925 --> 21:06.125
He bootstrapped his
way into a law degree

21:06.160 --> 21:07.927
while working in your mail-room.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.496
Did you consider taking
him on as an associate?

21:10.531 --> 21:11.777
We did.

21:12.511 --> 21:13.666
Briefly.

21:13.701 --> 21:16.192
Sounds like you didn't
hire him. Why not?

21:16.217 --> 21:17.570
With that kind of grit.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.308
The partners decided it would be best

21:19.333 --> 21:21.847
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

21:22.363 --> 21:25.527
We felt hiring Jimmy
might damage morale.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.652
Nepotism.

21:28.216 --> 21:31.250
Your firm is "Hamlin,
Hamlin, and McGill," right?

21:31.285 --> 21:33.017
Who's the other Hamlin?

21:35.538 --> 21:37.009
My father.

21:41.162 --> 21:44.890
Which partner was the most
concerned with nepotism?

21:45.476 --> 21:47.140
Charles McGill.

21:47.568 --> 21:50.382
- So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.
- Objection.

21:50.407 --> 21:53.806
How are the hiring practices of
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill relevant here?

21:53.841 --> 21:55.441
It's relevant to understand

21:55.476 --> 21:57.676
the relationship between these brothers.

21:58.970 --> 22:01.714
We'll, uh, give you
some leeway, Ms. Wexler,

22:01.749 --> 22:03.482
but don't stray too far.

22:03.518 --> 22:05.851
Charles McGill is not the
subject of this hearing.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.134
Thank you.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.078
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one

22:10.103 --> 22:11.791
that prevented you from hiring him?

22:11.826 --> 22:14.326
No. He did not.

22:15.212 --> 22:17.630
Eventually, he was hired
by the firm of Davis & Main.

22:17.665 --> 22:20.650
I'd be happy to say more
about that, if you'd like.

22:21.169 --> 22:23.803
No. Thank you.

22:23.838 --> 22:26.531
When Charles' condition appeared,

22:26.556 --> 22:28.040
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

22:28.075 --> 22:29.525
I believe so.

22:30.072 --> 22:32.536
Jimmy was struggling to
build his solo law practice,

22:32.561 --> 22:34.974
and yet, every single day, without fail,

22:34.999 --> 22:37.974
he brought his brother food, supplies...

22:37.999 --> 22:40.328
even his favorite
newspapers. Isn't that right?

22:40.353 --> 22:41.585
He did.

22:42.671 --> 22:46.038
Could you speak to the terms
of Charles' leave of absence?

22:46.577 --> 22:48.061
You know I can't.

22:48.086 --> 22:51.958
It was an FMLA leave.
Anything more is confidential.

22:51.983 --> 22:53.899
But you can confirm it was
due to mental illness, correct?

22:53.935 --> 22:57.568
Objection! Charles McGill's
mental health isn't at issue.

22:57.593 --> 23:00.201
This is a smear job on the
State Bar's upcoming witness...

23:00.226 --> 23:01.474
nothing more.

23:01.499 --> 23:03.542
This is not a competency
hearing, Ms. Wexler.

23:03.578 --> 23:05.990
Mr. Hamlin is not a
psychiatric professional.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.577
Do you have any questions
that would be more germane

23:07.602 --> 23:09.601
to his experience?

23:10.151 --> 23:11.546
No.

23:12.151 --> 23:13.951
I have nothing further.

23:14.297 --> 23:16.436
The witness is excused.

23:28.169 --> 23:29.869
At this time, the State Bar would like

23:29.894 --> 23:32.015
to enter Exhibit Five into evidence.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.106
We ask that Charles
McGill's recording be played.

23:34.141 --> 23:35.774
I'm respectfully renewing my objection.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.543
The probative value
of playing this Exhibit

23:37.578 --> 23:39.211
is outweighed by how prejudicial it is.

23:39.247 --> 23:40.455
All due respect to Ms. Wexler,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.982
but the State Bar feels
this is fundamental to hear.

23:43.017 --> 23:44.283
We don't want to leave any question

23:44.308 --> 23:46.151
as to the intentions of both parties.

23:46.187 --> 23:48.287
Ms. Wexler, we already
ruled this was fair game

23:48.322 --> 23:50.656
when we denied your motion to suppress.

23:50.691 --> 23:54.260
I'll add, the rough-and-tumble
of your client's conduct aside,

23:54.295 --> 23:55.807
we need to know whether one lawyer

23:55.832 --> 23:58.307
attempted to tamper
with another's evidence.

24:11.069 --> 24:12.241
Come here.

24:13.361 --> 24:14.513
What are you still doing here?

24:14.548 --> 24:17.016
- Flight's delayed.
- How delayed?

24:17.051 --> 24:18.851
40 minutes, last I checked.

24:18.886 --> 24:22.154
Shit. Okay. Keep me posted.

24:24.191 --> 24:25.624
Um, yes.

24:25.675 --> 24:27.047
Here we go.

24:30.131 --> 24:31.497
Thank you for your patience.

24:31.532 --> 24:33.165
The State Bar is ready to proceed.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.598
Um, begging your pardon.

24:34.623 --> 24:38.910
Um, the defense requests a
moment to review, if we could?

24:40.508 --> 24:41.941
All right.

24:41.976 --> 24:43.642
When you're ready.

24:43.678 --> 24:45.356
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

24:52.122 --> 24:54.186
What are we doing?

24:54.221 --> 24:55.692
We're stalling.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.464
Yes. Yes.

24:59.489 --> 25:02.722
My brother has many admirable qualities.

25:02.747 --> 25:06.856
I-In some ways, I can say I admire him.

25:07.445 --> 25:09.045
Too cold.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.442
I love my brother.

25:13.174 --> 25:16.395
But Ted Kaczynski's
brother loved him, too.

25:16.420 --> 25:18.477
And he wanted to help.

25:18.512 --> 25:21.413
That's sanctimonious.

25:21.449 --> 25:23.749
I love my brother.

25:23.784 --> 25:27.090
He's a good person. He has good in him.

25:27.922 --> 25:31.067
But the law is too important.

25:34.873 --> 25:35.928
Ah.

25:37.198 --> 25:39.160
Be right there, Howard!

25:45.139 --> 25:48.440
The law is too important.

25:48.876 --> 25:50.275
Hmm...

25:50.311 --> 25:53.759
I sure shit wouldn't
be tellin' ya otherwise.

25:54.057 --> 25:55.634
But, yes...

25:56.113 --> 25:57.658
it's the truth.

25:58.586 --> 26:01.453
You'd go to such
lengths to humiliate me?

26:01.489 --> 26:03.922
I did it for Kim!

26:03.947 --> 26:07.048
She worked her butt
off to get Mesa Verde

26:07.073 --> 26:11.181
while you and Howard sat around
sipping scotch and chortling.

26:11.206 --> 26:14.314
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill...
more like Scrooge and Marley!

26:14.339 --> 26:16.502
Kim deserves Mesa Verde...

26:16.527 --> 26:18.737
not you, not HHM.

26:18.773 --> 26:21.206
She earned it, and she needs it!

26:21.242 --> 26:23.108
I did it to help her,

26:23.144 --> 26:26.612
but I-I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

26:26.647 --> 26:29.314
I thought you'd just say,
"Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

26:29.350 --> 26:31.784
and go on with your life,
like a normal person!

26:31.819 --> 26:32.951
But, oh, no!

26:32.987 --> 26:35.020
Wishful thinking!

26:37.320 --> 26:39.925
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

26:39.960 --> 26:43.125
you're not quitting or
retiring or whatever?

26:45.132 --> 26:48.434
And can we take all this
shit down off the walls?

26:50.604 --> 26:53.003
I'm gonna go call Howard.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.528
Jimmy.

26:54.973 --> 26:58.739
You do realize you just
confessed to a felony?

26:59.094 --> 27:00.715
I guess.

27:01.115 --> 27:03.114
But you feel better, right?

27:04.285 --> 27:07.098
Besides, it's your word against mine.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.486
Uh. Um.

27:18.165 --> 27:20.699
All right, uh, Mr. Alley, uh,

27:20.734 --> 27:23.698
we need to make accommodations
for your next witness.

27:23.723 --> 27:25.528
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.

27:25.553 --> 27:26.644
All right.

27:26.669 --> 27:29.842
For those who don't know,
we need to prepare the room.

27:29.877 --> 27:32.945
Uh, the Clerk is going to
collect your, uh, cellphones,

27:32.980 --> 27:35.481
watches, key fobs...
anything electrical.

27:35.516 --> 27:38.745
If you prefer not to,
please secure your items...

27:38.770 --> 27:40.219
- Thank you.
- ... outside this room.

27:40.254 --> 27:42.154
Thank you for understanding.

27:42.189 --> 27:43.388
Your phone, sir?

27:43.424 --> 27:45.317
I left it in the car.

28:34.185 --> 28:36.074
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.542
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.309
Please raise your right hand.

28:53.763 --> 28:56.631
Do you swear or affirm to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

28:56.656 --> 28:58.222
and nothing but the truth?

28:58.247 --> 28:59.480
I do.

29:04.292 --> 29:05.800
Could you state your name?

29:05.825 --> 29:07.761
Charles L. McGill.

29:07.796 --> 29:11.893
I'm a senior partner at the law
firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.751
Can the court reporter hear me?

29:13.776 --> 29:15.676
Yes, sir. I can hear you fine.

29:15.701 --> 29:17.637
Mr. McGill, I'll try to be brief.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.428
We don't need to dwell on the burglary

29:19.453 --> 29:21.187
or the assault that you suffered.

29:21.212 --> 29:22.680
Thank you. I appreciate that.

29:22.705 --> 29:25.029
What I would like to
hear about is this tape.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.787
What compelled you to make it?

29:26.812 --> 29:29.856
I had a suspicion my brother
had tampered with documents

29:29.881 --> 29:31.518
in a case I was working on.

29:31.553 --> 29:32.850
And why would he do that?

29:32.875 --> 29:35.041
Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.616
I believe it was his hope
that the tainted documents

29:37.641 --> 29:40.193
would cause the client
to become disillusioned

29:40.228 --> 29:41.995
with my representation

29:42.030 --> 29:43.944
and return to their previous attorney,

29:43.969 --> 29:45.106
Ms. Wexler.

29:45.131 --> 29:48.268
Which, I should note, is
precisely what happened.

29:48.303 --> 29:49.623
Objection.

29:49.648 --> 29:52.186
I'm not saying Ms. Wexler
knew what Jimmy was doing

29:52.211 --> 29:53.753
or had any involvement.

29:53.778 --> 29:55.959
I'm only stating that it happened.

29:56.373 --> 29:59.327
Did you have any evidence to
support your suspicions about James?

29:59.352 --> 30:01.714
No. My brother,

30:01.750 --> 30:04.389
whatever else can be said
of him, can be quite clever.

30:04.414 --> 30:06.719
Did an excellent job
of covering his tracks.

30:06.755 --> 30:10.077
Objection. The witness has admitted
there's no corroborating evidence

30:10.102 --> 30:12.116
this supposed crime even occurred.

30:12.141 --> 30:14.553
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

30:15.545 --> 30:17.197
We're going to continue.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.897
Uh, we'll extend you the same
latitude on cross, Ms. Wexler.

30:21.803 --> 30:23.600
Go on, Mr. McGill.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.967
Without physical evidence,

30:24.992 --> 30:27.053
I felt that a recorded confession...

30:27.078 --> 30:29.542
if I could get one... was my best bet.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.006
On its own, I knew the tape
would be somewhat flimsy,

30:32.061 --> 30:33.327
but it was a start.

30:33.363 --> 30:36.631
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

30:36.656 --> 30:39.115
I suppose that Jimmy must have felt

30:39.150 --> 30:41.168
the tape was decisive
evidence on its own.

30:41.193 --> 30:43.159
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
broken in to destroy it.

30:43.184 --> 30:45.023
Objection. More speculation.

30:45.048 --> 30:46.915
How can he know what was
going on in Jimmy's head?

30:46.940 --> 30:50.047
Sustained. We just need to
hear what happened, Mr. McGill.

30:50.072 --> 30:52.280
I-I apologize.

30:52.315 --> 30:55.257
I recorded my brother to
build a case against him.

30:55.282 --> 30:56.470
And at the time,

30:56.495 --> 30:58.686
would you say that you were in
possession of your faculties?

30:58.721 --> 31:00.187
All due respect, but...

31:00.223 --> 31:02.822
but you do sound somewhat
unhinged on the recording.

31:02.847 --> 31:04.225
Yes, I understand that.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.560
But what you heard was theater.

31:06.596 --> 31:08.696
A performance, play-acting.

31:08.731 --> 31:12.094
I exaggerated the symptoms of my disease

31:12.119 --> 31:13.673
to extract the truth.

31:13.698 --> 31:15.870
Can we talk about your
disease for a moment?

31:15.905 --> 31:18.352
I'd like everybody here to
be on the same page about it.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.407
Of course.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.876
It is sometimes referred to as EHS,

31:21.911 --> 31:24.211
electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

31:24.247 --> 31:28.082
I describe it as an acute
allergy to electromagnetism.

31:28.117 --> 31:30.626
It's not a common condition, is it?

31:30.651 --> 31:32.987
I know it sounds strange. I do.

31:33.022 --> 31:36.002
But 30 years ago, no one had
heard of peanut allergies.

31:36.027 --> 31:38.059
But you admit that no one...

31:38.094 --> 31:40.658
uh, no doctor... has ever diagnosed you.

31:40.683 --> 31:44.619
AIDS was not identified
properly until 1981.

31:44.644 --> 31:47.702
HIV wasn't known as the cause until '83.

31:47.737 --> 31:51.072
These things take time to
unravel, even for doctors.

31:51.107 --> 31:52.504
Would you say that your illness

31:52.529 --> 31:54.542
affects your ability to think clearly?

31:54.577 --> 31:56.510
No. It affects me physically.

31:56.546 --> 32:00.041
It causes me great pain.
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

32:00.072 --> 32:01.349
Thank you.

32:01.384 --> 32:04.785
Mr. McGill, I have only
one more question for you.

32:06.247 --> 32:08.353
Do you hate your brother?

32:09.625 --> 32:11.658
Absolutely not.

32:12.377 --> 32:14.528
I love my brother.

32:14.564 --> 32:17.226
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

32:18.334 --> 32:20.656
He has a way of doing the worst things

32:20.681 --> 32:23.404
for reasons that sound almost noble.

32:24.999 --> 32:27.062
But what I know for sure is that the law

32:27.087 --> 32:29.803
is too important to be toyed with.

32:29.828 --> 32:32.295
It's mankind's greatest
achievement... the Rule of Law,

32:32.320 --> 32:33.948
the idea that, no matter who you are,

32:33.983 --> 32:36.217
your actions have consequences.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.820
And the way my brother treats the law...

32:41.252 --> 32:43.124
it breaks my heart.

32:43.159 --> 32:45.844
That's why I did what
I did. Not to hurt him,

32:45.869 --> 32:48.756
but to protect something
that I hold sacred.

32:48.781 --> 32:50.598
Thank you, Mr. McGill.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.533
The State Bar rests.

32:56.202 --> 32:58.478
I think we need to put on the brakes.

33:01.819 --> 33:05.226
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and
I need a moment to confer.

33:06.069 --> 33:07.915
Please be brief, Counselor.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.617
Yes, of course.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.138
She'll be here.

33:14.857 --> 33:17.039
Do you have anything for cross?

33:17.064 --> 33:19.345
Uh, can I look at your notes?

33:19.370 --> 33:20.711
Yeah, of course.

33:20.736 --> 33:21.962
Can we, um...

33:21.998 --> 33:23.798
Yeah.

33:34.076 --> 33:35.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:35.378 --> 33:36.877
So glad you made it.

33:40.154 --> 33:42.283
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.

33:42.318 --> 33:46.053
Um, might I have a moment,
uh, to get a breath?

33:46.088 --> 33:48.155
Oh, of course, Mr. McGill.

33:48.191 --> 33:51.058
Uh, folks, let's call this 15.

33:51.093 --> 33:55.229
Everybody, please be back
and ready to go on the hour.

34:03.012 --> 34:05.309
- Rebecca.
- Chuck.

34:05.708 --> 34:06.874
It's good to see you.

34:06.909 --> 34:09.877
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

34:09.911 --> 34:11.679
Did Jimmy subpoena you?

34:11.704 --> 34:14.400
You're not on the witness
list. You don't have to testify.

34:14.426 --> 34:16.484
No, no, no, no. I'm not here for that.

34:16.518 --> 34:18.512
Well, what, then?

34:18.855 --> 34:21.371
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

34:21.887 --> 34:25.159
I-I can't believe what
you've been going through.

34:25.194 --> 34:26.827
How long has it been?

34:26.862 --> 34:28.244
Ah.

34:28.268 --> 34:29.929
You're here to help.

34:29.966 --> 34:32.266
Because all this is so stressful for me.

34:33.402 --> 34:34.994
Is that what Jimmy told you?

34:35.018 --> 34:36.370
He's worried about you, Chuck.

34:36.405 --> 34:38.672
In spite of everything that's
happened between the two of you,

34:38.708 --> 34:39.739
he... he cares.

34:39.775 --> 34:40.940
What exactly did he say?

34:40.976 --> 34:43.344
Um, well, that you had been sick.

34:43.379 --> 34:45.177
Allergic to electricity?

34:45.202 --> 34:47.114
He sent me pictures of the house.

34:47.149 --> 34:49.373
Chuck, my God.

34:50.052 --> 34:52.018
Why didn't you tell me?

34:52.054 --> 34:54.088
I didn't want to upset you.

34:54.123 --> 34:56.123
Worry you unnecessarily.

34:57.894 --> 34:59.793
But now you're here.

34:59.829 --> 35:01.595
And now you know.

35:04.066 --> 35:06.468
I came because I thought
it was the right thing.

35:06.493 --> 35:09.270
I thought... I don't know...
that you'd want me to.

35:09.305 --> 35:12.906
But I guess that I'm
more of a distraction.

35:12.931 --> 35:14.275
So, uh...

35:14.310 --> 35:16.310
I'm gonna be in town for a few days,

35:16.345 --> 35:19.613
and I would love to
spend some time with you.

35:19.649 --> 35:21.585
But right now, I-I think I should go.

35:21.632 --> 35:23.617
No. No, no, please. I want you to stay.

35:23.653 --> 35:25.553
Really? You don't seem happy to see me.

35:25.588 --> 35:27.121
I am.

35:27.156 --> 35:29.759
Just surprised, that's all.

35:30.134 --> 35:32.493
Please, stay.

35:32.528 --> 35:33.720
Are you sure?

35:33.745 --> 35:35.439
Yes, I'm sure.

35:35.464 --> 35:38.232
You've been sold a
bill of goods, Rebecca.

35:38.689 --> 35:41.009
I want you to see what's what.

35:49.978 --> 35:52.259
She's not what I expected.

35:53.516 --> 35:55.849
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

35:55.885 --> 35:57.704
I don't know. Just...

35:58.258 --> 35:59.797
not her.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.563
You know, she's gonna
hate you when this is over.

36:08.010 --> 36:09.345
Yep.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.579
All right, uh, Mr. McGill,

36:22.615 --> 36:24.442
I'll remind you you're still under oath.

36:24.467 --> 36:25.750
I understand.

36:25.785 --> 36:28.423
At this time, I'd like to
turn cross-examination over

36:28.448 --> 36:30.615
to my co-counsel, James McGill.

36:37.271 --> 36:39.496
Uh, well, there's been
a lot of fuss about it,

36:39.521 --> 36:42.622
but you and I have never really
talked about this tape you made.

36:42.657 --> 36:44.123
We lost the opportunity

36:44.159 --> 36:46.771
when you burglarized
my house to destroy it.

36:46.796 --> 36:48.067
Fair enough.

36:48.092 --> 36:49.929
Um, and I was in the wrong there.

36:49.964 --> 36:53.266
But, still, I'd like to
try and follow your story

36:53.301 --> 36:55.821
of why and how you recorded it.

36:55.846 --> 36:58.104
Oh, is this where you
claim the tape is spurious?

36:58.139 --> 36:59.872
That it's not really your voice?

36:59.908 --> 37:02.197
No. That's me on the tape.

37:02.744 --> 37:05.119
But, still, I have some
questions. Like, the recorder,

37:05.144 --> 37:08.572
it must've hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

37:09.072 --> 37:11.451
There was a degree of
discomfort, that's true.

37:11.486 --> 37:12.819
And where did you hide it?

37:12.854 --> 37:14.454
I mean, the sound's pretty clear,

37:14.489 --> 37:16.605
so it wasn't in the
couch cushions, was it?

37:16.630 --> 37:19.158
Tucked under a space
blanket. Out of sight.

37:19.194 --> 37:20.493
Wow.

37:20.528 --> 37:22.228
So there's no chance I would see it.

37:22.263 --> 37:23.529
Not with the state your place was in.

37:23.565 --> 37:25.465
- Isn't that right?
- I suppose.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.271
Would you like to set the scene
for the Disciplinary Committee?

37:28.296 --> 37:30.230
Tell them, you know, what
your house looked like

37:30.255 --> 37:31.681
at the time of the recording.

37:31.706 --> 37:34.140
Objection. Relevance?

37:34.175 --> 37:37.677
Well, the circumstances of the
recording are materially relevant.

37:37.712 --> 37:39.412
How can you know what
the tape really means

37:39.447 --> 37:41.848
unless you know what was
going on when it was recorded?

37:41.883 --> 37:44.397
Overruled. The witness
can answer the question.

37:44.422 --> 37:48.654
I covered most of the walls
with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.

37:48.690 --> 37:51.695
I also hung a number of space blankets.

37:52.352 --> 37:54.342
Compact Mylar sheets.

37:54.367 --> 37:55.595
They insulate and protect

37:55.630 --> 37:58.633
against mild electromagnetic radiation.

37:59.033 --> 38:02.881
All right, so, shiny
insulation and space blankets

38:02.906 --> 38:04.737
all over the walls and the ceiling.

38:04.773 --> 38:07.273
It was like being
inside of a disco ball.

38:07.308 --> 38:09.234
Do you have a point?

38:09.984 --> 38:12.578
Well, um, I'm impressed

38:12.614 --> 38:15.081
by how much work went
into entrapping me.

38:15.116 --> 38:16.182
You went all out.

38:16.217 --> 38:17.925
I didn't entrap you.

38:17.950 --> 38:20.686
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

38:20.722 --> 38:22.455
That's not the same thing.

38:24.050 --> 38:26.926
How did you know it would work?

38:26.961 --> 38:28.361
What do you mean?

38:28.396 --> 38:31.364
How did you know your
"provocation" would work?

38:31.389 --> 38:33.966
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic

38:34.002 --> 38:36.144
would make me say anything?

38:36.589 --> 38:40.197
Isn't it because you knew
that it was precisely the thing

38:40.222 --> 38:41.574
that would worry me so much

38:41.609 --> 38:43.776
that I'd say anything to talk you down?

38:43.812 --> 38:46.546
- Objection.
- Okay. Withdrawn.

38:46.941 --> 38:49.615
Let's... let's get back to your house,

38:49.651 --> 38:52.736
every surface covered in tinfoil.

38:52.761 --> 38:54.720
Nothing crazy about that, huh?

38:54.745 --> 38:56.261
As I've said,

38:56.286 --> 38:59.648
I was playing up my condition.

38:59.694 --> 39:01.494
Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.

39:01.529 --> 39:03.062
You think your house is normal?

39:03.097 --> 39:06.077
Can I call your
attention to Exhibit Nine?

39:10.538 --> 39:12.338
This is your house, right?

39:12.373 --> 39:13.673
Yes.

39:13.708 --> 39:16.171
So, exposed wires.

39:17.812 --> 39:20.351
There's a camp stove.

39:20.682 --> 39:23.916
There's a lantern on top of newspapers.

39:23.952 --> 39:25.184
You call this normal?

39:25.220 --> 39:27.587
I call them adaptations.

39:27.622 --> 39:31.023
A prophylactic measure for a
physical, medical condition.

39:31.059 --> 39:33.304
Did the doctor who granted
me guardianship for you

39:33.329 --> 39:35.944
- think this was a physical condition?
- Objection.

39:35.969 --> 39:38.224
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

39:38.249 --> 39:40.015
Besides which, the
panel has already ruled

39:40.040 --> 39:42.674
that Mr. McGill's mental
health is not at issue.

39:42.699 --> 39:45.348
No, the State Bar opened
the door to this on direct

39:45.373 --> 39:48.474
when the witness talked about
his supposed "play-acting."

39:48.510 --> 39:51.544
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

39:51.579 --> 39:53.179
We discussed the physical allergy,

39:53.214 --> 39:54.280
not a mental disability.

39:54.315 --> 39:55.481
Potato, po-tah-to.

39:55.517 --> 39:57.370
It comes down to this...

39:57.395 --> 39:59.819
In order to understand
what I was thinking,

39:59.854 --> 40:02.247
you need to see Chuck through my eyes.

40:02.272 --> 40:06.125
You need to know if I believed
that tape was evidence.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.411
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing...

40:08.474 --> 40:11.130
My brother hates me.

40:11.165 --> 40:15.201
Now, he claims that he lied to
me to get me to tell the truth.

40:15.236 --> 40:16.636
And I'm telling you

40:16.671 --> 40:19.405
I lied to my brother
to make him feel better.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.039
Which of us you believe

40:21.064 --> 40:25.032
depends on how we all understand
the mind of Charles McGill.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.078
Well, we did promise
the defense some leeway.

40:31.103 --> 40:32.569
You may proceed.

40:32.594 --> 40:35.399
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
- But watch yourself.

40:42.410 --> 40:44.597
Chuck, I'd like to go
back a little further,

40:44.632 --> 40:47.033
talk about when these
symptoms first started.

40:47.068 --> 40:50.886
It was shortly after you
were divorced, is that right?

40:52.644 --> 40:54.173
Yes.

40:54.208 --> 40:56.776
You think the stress of the
divorce brought on the illness?

40:56.811 --> 40:59.228
I doubt it. It was an amicable split.

40:59.253 --> 41:01.558
My ex-wife and I are
still on good terms.

41:01.583 --> 41:05.051
In fact, your ex-wife is present
with us today, is she not?

41:05.086 --> 41:06.786
When was the last time
you two saw each other?

41:06.821 --> 41:09.064
Objection. This is not family court.

41:09.089 --> 41:11.580
We're not here to re-litigate
the witness' divorce.

41:11.605 --> 41:13.259
I can't see what purpose this serves.

41:13.294 --> 41:14.961
I can.

41:14.996 --> 41:18.364
I'll tell you why my brother
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

41:18.406 --> 41:20.803
4,000 miles she came,

41:20.828 --> 41:23.521
lured by concern for me.

41:23.927 --> 41:26.865
What Jimmy's driving at
is the last time I saw her,

41:26.890 --> 41:28.566
I covered up my illness.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.077
I'd been suffering
from it for some time,

41:31.112 --> 41:34.447
but I went to great lengths
to conceal that fact from her.

41:36.184 --> 41:38.833
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

41:41.089 --> 41:44.146
I didn't want you to think less of me.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.637
Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.

41:48.662 --> 41:50.496
You know why?

41:50.531 --> 41:52.254
To rattle me.

41:52.279 --> 41:54.535
He knows I still have a...

41:54.560 --> 41:58.270
a lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.

41:58.306 --> 42:01.140
He's hoping this will break me down.

42:01.175 --> 42:02.521
Split me apart at the seams,

42:02.546 --> 42:06.076
like a murderer confessing on
an episode of "Perry Mason."

42:07.215 --> 42:10.650
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint you, Jimmy.

42:12.487 --> 42:16.588
Have I answered your
questions to your satisfaction?

42:16.900 --> 42:19.228
Do you have anything else?

42:20.795 --> 42:22.627
Yeah, I do.

42:23.033 --> 42:25.464
Earlier, you talked
about other diseases.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.369
Physical conditions, you said.

42:27.394 --> 42:30.503
Uh, so, okay, if you'd
had, um... I don't know...

42:30.538 --> 42:34.658
lung cancer, would you
have told Rebecca then?

42:36.259 --> 42:39.311
If that had been the
case, maybe. I might have.

42:39.347 --> 42:42.815
- So how is this different?
- Mr. McGill. Move it along.

42:42.850 --> 42:44.120
You don't have to answer that.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.534
I want to get down to brass tacks.

42:45.559 --> 42:47.953
I want to be very, very specific here.

42:47.989 --> 42:50.563
This illness, what does it feel like?

42:50.588 --> 42:52.291
You mentioned it's painful.

42:52.326 --> 42:53.502
It is.

42:53.527 --> 42:55.745
There's a tightness in my chest,

42:55.770 --> 42:57.407
difficulty breathing,

42:57.432 --> 43:00.299
and pain, burning pain.

43:00.334 --> 43:02.468
The pain spreads everywhere.

43:02.503 --> 43:04.799
Sounds horrible. Does it hurt right now?

43:04.824 --> 43:07.923
There's always some discomfort, yes.

43:07.948 --> 43:10.313
Electricity is everywhere
in the modern world.

43:11.679 --> 43:14.914
But I very much appreciate
the indulgence of the panel

43:14.949 --> 43:16.979
for their accommodation here today.

43:17.004 --> 43:19.104
I can handle this fine.

43:22.623 --> 43:25.377
Right, so, with the lights
out, you don't feel them?

43:25.417 --> 43:27.220
If the current's not flowing, no.

43:27.245 --> 43:29.161
Oh. Sorry about the exit signs.

43:29.197 --> 43:31.259
I guess they couldn't
kill those for you.

43:31.284 --> 43:33.399
Well, they're not drawing much
current, and they're far away.

43:34.736 --> 43:36.869
Intensity drops off with distance,

43:36.904 --> 43:38.437
per the inverse-square law.

43:38.473 --> 43:39.739
Okay, whoa!

43:39.774 --> 43:41.213
Inverse-square... I'm not a physicist.

43:41.238 --> 43:43.609
Could you dumb that down a shade for me?

43:43.644 --> 43:44.995
The farther away it is,

43:45.020 --> 43:47.857
the stronger the source
needs to be to have an effect.

43:47.882 --> 43:49.182
Got it. Got it.

43:49.229 --> 43:52.118
So, if I had a small battery,
say, from a watch or something,

43:52.153 --> 43:54.917
and I got it close to you,
close to your skin, you'd know?

43:54.942 --> 43:56.523
I would feel it, yes.

43:56.557 --> 43:57.612
Can you feel more current

43:57.637 --> 44:00.227
coming from any particular
direction right now?

44:00.252 --> 44:01.761
Uh, from that back wall

44:01.796 --> 44:04.296
or, uh, from over there

44:04.332 --> 44:05.931
or up through the floor?

44:05.967 --> 44:08.400
Can you tell us where
the nearest source is

44:08.436 --> 44:09.935
right now?

44:13.741 --> 44:16.623
Jimmy, do you have
something in your pocket?

44:18.365 --> 44:21.396
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

44:24.654 --> 44:26.254
My cellphone.

44:26.279 --> 44:30.055
From this distance, you should
feel it, and you don't, do you?

44:30.091 --> 44:34.070
Mr. McGill, you were warned to
leave your electronics outside.

44:34.095 --> 44:35.795
It's all right.

44:35.830 --> 44:37.428
It's all right.

44:38.145 --> 44:39.654
May I?

44:41.228 --> 44:42.553
Ah.

44:45.273 --> 44:47.038
Just as I thought.

44:47.063 --> 44:48.741
There's no battery in here.

44:48.776 --> 44:50.576
You removed the battery.

44:52.031 --> 44:55.347
That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?

44:55.383 --> 44:58.504
Yeah, you got me, Chuck. Dead to rights.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.753
I removed the battery.

45:00.788 --> 45:02.922
- Objection.
- Sustained.

45:02.957 --> 45:04.990
Y-You've taken all the leeway
you're getting, Mr. McGill.

45:05.026 --> 45:06.709
Wrap it up fast.

45:07.084 --> 45:08.779
God, Jimmy.

45:09.219 --> 45:11.707
Don't you know by now this is real?

45:11.732 --> 45:12.965
I feel this.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.267
It's a physical response to stimuli.

45:15.303 --> 45:17.467
It's not a quirk.

45:19.195 --> 45:21.707
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

45:22.234 --> 45:23.767
I don't know, Chuck.

45:24.357 --> 45:26.139
Could you reach into your breast pocket

45:26.164 --> 45:28.214
and tell me what's there?

45:29.646 --> 45:31.092
What now?

45:37.740 --> 45:40.225
Can you tell the court what that was?

45:42.396 --> 45:44.196
- A battery.
- Mr. Chairman, please.

45:44.232 --> 45:45.831
Do you recognize that man in back?

45:45.867 --> 45:48.534
His name is Huell Babineaux.
He's on our witness list.

45:48.569 --> 45:50.256
You bumped into him in the stairway.

45:50.281 --> 45:53.516
He'll testify he planted this
fully charged battery on you

45:53.541 --> 45:55.140
over an hour and a half ago.

45:55.176 --> 45:56.575
Hour and 43 minutes ago.

45:56.611 --> 45:59.712
An hour and 43 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Babineaux.

45:59.737 --> 46:01.512
And you felt nothing.

46:01.537 --> 46:02.548
No, no, no.

46:02.583 --> 46:04.786
- No, no. It's a trick. It has to...
- Enough is enough.

46:04.811 --> 46:08.053
I submit that Mr. McGill's
mental illness is a non-issue.

46:08.089 --> 46:09.301
- If he were schizophrenic...
- Schizo...

46:09.326 --> 46:10.583
... it wouldn't take
away from the fact...

46:10.608 --> 46:12.315
- ... that the defendant...
- I am not crazy!

46:16.230 --> 46:18.163
I am not crazy.

46:18.831 --> 46:20.877
I know he swapped those numbers.

46:20.902 --> 46:23.168
I knew it was 1216.

46:23.204 --> 46:24.570
One after Magna Carta.

46:24.605 --> 46:26.331
As if I could ever make such a mistake.

46:26.356 --> 46:28.007
Never. Never!

46:28.042 --> 46:30.589
I just... I just couldn't prove it.

46:30.614 --> 46:32.128
H-H-He covered his tracks.

46:32.153 --> 46:34.790
He got that idiot at the
copy shop to lie for him.

46:34.825 --> 46:36.636
Mr. McGill, please. You
don't have to go in...

46:36.661 --> 46:37.909
You think this is something?

46:37.934 --> 46:40.853
You think this is bad,
this... this chicanery?

46:40.888 --> 46:43.589
He's done worse. That billboard!

46:43.624 --> 46:46.625
Are you telling me that a man
just happens to fall like that?

46:46.661 --> 46:48.589
No. He orchestrated it!

46:48.614 --> 46:49.987
Jimmy!

46:50.784 --> 46:54.166
He defecated through a sunroof!

46:54.191 --> 46:57.136
And I saved him, and I shouldn't have.

46:57.161 --> 46:59.510
I took him into my own firm.

46:59.535 --> 47:01.740
What was I thinking?!

47:01.776 --> 47:03.642
He'll never change.

47:03.678 --> 47:05.044
He'll never change.

47:05.079 --> 47:07.613
Ever since he was 9, always the same.

47:07.648 --> 47:10.416
Couldn't keep his hands
out of the cash drawer.

47:10.451 --> 47:12.117
But not our Jimmy.

47:12.153 --> 47:14.553
Couldn't be precious Jimmy!

47:14.588 --> 47:16.800
Stealing them blind.

47:16.825 --> 47:18.958
And he gets to be a lawyer?!

47:18.993 --> 47:21.126
What a sick joke!

47:21.162 --> 47:23.963
I should have stopped
him when I had the chance!

47:23.998 --> 47:25.764
And you... you have to stop him!

47:25.800 --> 47:27.299
You...

47:49.490 --> 47:51.236
I apologize.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.970
I lost my train of thought.

47:59.047 --> 48:01.280
I got carried away.

48:06.830 --> 48:08.563
Do you have anything else?

48:10.912 --> 48:12.413
No.

48:12.438 --> 48:14.170
Nothing further.
