WEBVTT

00:00.286 --> 00:02.594
Previously on Royal Pains.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.652
This is a pager watch.

00:04.777 --> 00:08.093
- When it beeps you would proceed directly here.
- I'm in.

00:08.413 --> 00:11.943
Excellent work.
I knew you had it in you.

00:12.543 --> 00:15.765
Hank, meet my translator, Christina Dumond,

00:15.890 --> 00:17.678
- pleased to meet you.
- And you.

00:17.803 --> 00:19.493
I'd like to offer my car and driver

00:19.635 --> 00:21.469
for you to have
an evening and a meal out

00:21.471 --> 00:22.503
with Christina.

00:22.505 --> 00:24.572
Well, that's very generous.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.051 --> 00:41.022
Just look at her.
She's, like, perfect.

00:41.024 --> 00:43.992
Sexy curves, great body.

00:43.994 --> 00:46.628
- Should I be jealous?
- Mm-hmm.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.064
Very. Rowwr!

00:50.066 --> 00:53.034
And her, she's the one
I'm taking home,

00:53.036 --> 00:56.037
along with her 454 horses.
Okay, babe,

00:56.039 --> 00:58.006
I know you've always dreamed
of owning a Ferrari,

00:58.008 --> 01:00.275
but it's a very expensive
raffle ticket.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.877
You think you can afford
that gamble?

01:02.879 --> 01:05.180
No, I can't,
but my company can.

01:05.182 --> 01:07.182
Come on.

01:07.184 --> 01:09.517
Why does a medical practice
need a Ferrari?

01:09.519 --> 01:10.985
To cut down on response time.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.621
That is the only reason
I'm doing it... for the patients.

01:13.623 --> 01:15.790
- The only reason?
- Okay, maybe also because

01:15.792 --> 01:17.759
it's my destiny
to own a Ferrari.

01:17.761 --> 01:19.794
I think it's so cute

01:19.796 --> 01:21.930
you believe you're gonna win
the charity raffle.

01:21.932 --> 01:23.398
Count me in.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.732
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24.734 --> 01:26.801
But let's drum up a lot
of business at this rally,

01:26.803 --> 01:28.203
just to cover our bases.

01:28.205 --> 01:30.972
I really like it
when you crack the fiscal whip,

01:30.974 --> 01:34.142
as it were...
It's sexy.

01:34.144 --> 01:37.779
Speaking of sexy.

01:37.781 --> 01:39.514
So... First of all,
she's red.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.683
That's extra sexiness points
off the bat.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.251
Exposed engine.
And the interior...

01:43.253 --> 01:44.652
this one has
a "do not touch" sign.

01:44.654 --> 01:45.887
I'm not gonna touch it.
I just want to sense it

01:45.889 --> 01:47.188
and smell it
and take in its aura.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.924
Ah, leather.

01:49.926 --> 01:52.260
Interesting. The cow is...

01:54.830 --> 01:56.664
Don't touch it.
You're gonna make it worse.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.333
Okay, that has my name on it.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.734
Those are my business cards.

01:59.736 --> 02:01.603
All right...
Oh, my God.

02:01.605 --> 02:03.705
Um, I... I...
Hi.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.208
I'm Sam chard.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.576
I see you brought me
some gelato.

02:08.578 --> 02:10.845
And it goes so nicely
with my leather seats.

02:10.847 --> 02:13.414
- I am so... I'm so sorry.
- He is so sorry.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.149
It's okay.
It's just a car.

02:15.151 --> 02:18.286
"It's just a car."
Wow...

02:18.288 --> 02:19.287
I'm a little offended right now

02:19.289 --> 02:20.421
that you're not cursing at me

02:20.423 --> 02:22.056
in Italian.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.424
And I am gonna be right back

02:23.426 --> 02:25.627
to rescue your Italian leather.

02:25.629 --> 02:27.295
Thank you, babe.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.931
- Let's see the damage. Wow.
- Yeah, it got right in there.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.233
- Oh, is this yours?
- Oh, God.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.701
- This is... Oh.
- Yeah.

02:33.703 --> 02:36.671
- Are you a doctor?
- No, no, I'm not.

02:36.673 --> 02:39.240
I can have one here faster
than this baby can do 0 to 60.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.241
Why, is someone sick?

02:40.243 --> 02:44.712
Yeah. Me.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.254
Jeremiah,
is there something that I...

02:53.256 --> 02:57.892
would you take
my first patient?

02:57.894 --> 03:01.229
Why don't you want to work
with Mrs. small?

03:01.231 --> 03:03.765
Uh, she's a...
she's a geographical outlier

03:03.767 --> 03:05.300
on the schedule
Paige arranged for me.

03:05.302 --> 03:07.835
She's 4.6 Miles east
of Mr. adler, and, uh...

03:07.837 --> 03:10.204
Jeremiah...

03:10.206 --> 03:13.508
Are you afraid of handling
emotional women?

03:15.644 --> 03:19.113
It hasn't been within
the scope of my practice.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.616
I don't have the tools
to treat postpartum depression.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.451
Severe mood swings...

03:23.453 --> 03:25.553
Spells of anger towards others,
inability to be comforted.

03:25.555 --> 03:27.722
Yes, I know the symptoms.

03:27.724 --> 03:30.658
Jeremiah, you're not working
in a laboratory any more.

03:30.660 --> 03:33.928
You have to evolve to become
a part of this practice.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.633
Look, when I first started
at Hankmed,

03:38.635 --> 03:41.636
I struggled
with self-destructive patients.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.072
People who took foolish risks
with their own health

03:44.074 --> 03:46.941
and expected me
to bail them out.

03:46.943 --> 03:51.479
But I began to evolve.
And so can you.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.382
Maybe I can do this.

03:56.285 --> 03:58.319
If you come with me.

04:02.191 --> 04:06.260
So how can I help you, Sam?

04:06.262 --> 04:08.529
Doctor/patient confidentiality
applies to everything

04:08.531 --> 04:09.731
I tell you, right?

04:09.733 --> 04:11.766
Yeah, unless you plan
to commit a crime.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.701
On the contrary.

04:13.703 --> 04:16.170
I am not a rich socialite.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.906
I don't own a Ferrari.
This isn't even my dress.

04:18.908 --> 04:20.475
It's my disguise.

04:20.476 --> 04:23.177
You're working undercover?

04:23.179 --> 04:24.979
D.E.A.

04:24.981 --> 04:26.180
Here in the Hamptons?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.349
I didn't say it was a bad gig.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.450
But the hair extensions,

04:29.452 --> 04:31.285
the spanx,
the six-inch heels...

04:31.287 --> 04:33.454
Yes, being rich
is very hard work.

04:33.456 --> 04:36.190
Do you have any idea
how many squat thrusts it takes

04:36.192 --> 04:39.127
to burn off six ounces
of caviar?

04:39.129 --> 04:40.828
Right. Okay.

04:40.830 --> 04:44.198
You know, the fact
that you don't believe me

04:44.200 --> 04:45.700
is kind of a compliment.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.001
I didn't say
I don't believe you,

04:47.003 --> 04:48.503
it's just that
you don't look exactly...

04:48.505 --> 04:50.738
Henry Lawson, born August 23rd.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.840
I won't mention the year because
that just wouldn't be classy.

04:52.842 --> 04:55.309
Passaic high,
Northwestern university,

04:55.311 --> 04:56.778
mt. Sinai school
of medicine.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.980
Your brother's fiancee's father
is running for senate.

04:58.982 --> 05:01.783
Oh, and unlike your father,
you've never been arrested.

05:01.785 --> 05:04.585
Except for that time
in Atlantic city.

05:06.288 --> 05:09.023
I was 20 years old, and it was
a few hands of Blackjack.

05:09.025 --> 05:10.491
I know.

05:10.493 --> 05:12.160
Can we just talk about you?

05:12.162 --> 05:14.629
Great. Um...

05:17.433 --> 05:21.035
Okay, the first symptoms started
a couple weeks ago...

05:21.037 --> 05:23.705
headaches, trouble sleeping,
fatigue.

05:23.707 --> 05:26.140
My old partner started
the same way.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.909
And so did a lot of other agents
who worked meth cases

05:27.911 --> 05:29.811
back in the '90s.

05:29.813 --> 05:32.146
"Meth toxicity"
is what they called it.

05:32.148 --> 05:36.350
Most of them eventually
had to leave the agency,

05:36.352 --> 05:41.622
and a lot of 'em died,
including my partner.

05:41.624 --> 05:44.492
And you're wondering
if your symptoms are consistent

05:44.494 --> 05:45.793
with toxicity as well.

05:45.795 --> 05:49.397
I'm done wondering, Hank.
I just...

05:49.399 --> 05:51.733
I need to know how bad it is.

05:58.875 --> 06:03.544

06:03.546 --> 06:08.316

Sync and correction by Tony for
www.Addic7ed.Com

06:25.342 --> 06:27.710
do you know how many units
the last one sold?

06:27.712 --> 06:29.912
Uh-huh, that's right,
half a million...

06:29.914 --> 06:31.614
In the first week.

06:31.616 --> 06:33.116
I wanted a 30% bump,

06:33.118 --> 06:34.550
and this offer is
practically nothing,

06:34.552 --> 06:36.185
other than an insult.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.353
Call me back when you're
at least in the ballpark.

06:37.355 --> 06:41.891
- Oh!
- We'll be back in a moment.

06:41.893 --> 06:45.161
I must say, Mrs. small,
you don't seem to be manifesting

06:45.163 --> 06:46.996
many symptoms
of postpartum depression.

06:46.998 --> 06:50.099
Oh, I'm not suffering
from postpartum depression.

06:50.101 --> 06:52.635
My husband is.

06:52.637 --> 06:54.937
Making sure you'll always

06:54.939 --> 06:58.074
be there for him,
even when you aren't.

07:03.046 --> 07:06.616
He uses these rallies
as his front.

07:06.618 --> 07:08.217
I was in Newport beach
last week,

07:08.219 --> 07:11.687
I'm here now, and I'll be
wherever he goes next.

07:11.689 --> 07:13.189
I thought that these days
you guys wear

07:13.191 --> 07:14.957
all kinds of protective gear.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.993
You know, especially
when busting meth labs.

07:16.995 --> 07:19.395
Well, we do when we know
we're busting one.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.565
But about a year ago
I was chasing a suspect

07:22.567 --> 07:24.467
into a garage when suddenly

07:24.469 --> 07:26.102
everything when orange
and white.

07:26.104 --> 07:28.738
It sounded like a train
crashing into,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.173
well, a meth lab.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.108
Wow, that must have
 been scary.

07:32.110 --> 07:35.111
I was down ten minutes
breathing in toxic fumes

07:35.113 --> 07:36.546
before they could get me out.

07:36.548 --> 07:38.381
A meth lab explosion...

07:38.383 --> 07:39.715
I mean, it could have been
a lot worse.

07:39.717 --> 07:41.684
You're lucky.
I don't believe in luck.

07:41.686 --> 07:43.319
I believe in being prepared.

07:43.321 --> 07:46.222
Which is why I need to know
how bad this is.

07:46.224 --> 07:50.126
If I can't continue this case,
I need to find a replacement.

07:50.128 --> 07:53.529
Well, don't turn in
your manolos just yet.

07:53.531 --> 07:54.897
Your X-ray looks clean,

07:54.899 --> 07:55.731
and the symptoms
you're experiencing

07:55.733 --> 07:57.266
can have many causes.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.701
Let's wait and see
what the blood work shows,

07:58.703 --> 07:59.702
and take it from there.

07:59.704 --> 08:01.871
Okay.

08:01.873 --> 08:06.342
118 over 69.

08:09.179 --> 08:10.246
98.4.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.948
All normal.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.983
See? I told you guys
I'm fine.

08:13.985 --> 08:16.185
"Fine" is not
a medical term, JJ.

08:16.187 --> 08:19.455
The truth is, men undergo
hormonal changes too.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.756
One in ten new fathers

08:20.758 --> 08:22.258
experiences
postpartum depression,

08:22.260 --> 08:24.360
even though most of them
never even know it.

08:24.362 --> 08:26.028
So how do you guys know
it's one in every ten?

08:26.030 --> 08:29.298
That's a valid
scientific challenge.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.900
Sorry, but it is.

08:30.902 --> 08:33.635
Yes. Let's not dwell
on the numbers.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.504
Jill, we're more interested
in you.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.306
So how is your diet?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.975
Diet's fine.
I eat like a champ,

08:38.977 --> 08:40.342
believe you me.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.746
- Any changes at work?
- No, not really.

08:43.748 --> 08:45.047
How about serious injuries?

08:45.049 --> 08:46.849
No serious injuries.

08:46.851 --> 08:48.584
Okay, honestly, you guys,
everything is great.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.753
I may be a little
emotional lately,

08:50.755 --> 08:54.090
but it's because
of triple-j.

08:54.092 --> 08:56.225
I'm sorry, triple-j?

08:56.227 --> 08:57.927
That's what I call my son,
JJ junior.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.795
And I love him more
than anything, just like I love

08:59.797 --> 09:02.064
my beautiful
but overzealous wife.

09:02.066 --> 09:04.133
I mean, these things should
make you emotional, right?

09:04.135 --> 09:07.003
Can you hold that for me?
Yes, yes, yes.

09:07.005 --> 09:07.970
Here, honey, take the baby.

09:07.972 --> 09:11.207
I got him.

09:11.209 --> 09:12.375
Come here.
Moo moo moo moo.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.477
Shh, it's okay.
Come on.

09:14.479 --> 09:19.348
- Thank you, honey.
- Mm-hmm.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.651
She wishes I'd act
a little more macho.

09:21.653 --> 09:24.220
She's afraid of me coming off
like a stie,

09:24.222 --> 09:26.088
thinks it's bad
for appearances.

09:26.090 --> 09:28.391
But, anyways, listen.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.993
Thank you for coming
to check on me, but I'm fine.

09:30.995 --> 09:33.195
I'm healthy.
You look healthy to me.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.463
Uh, clinically speaking.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.165
If there is anything else
that we can do,

09:36.167 --> 09:39.735
even if it is just to talk...

09:39.737 --> 09:41.504
Please don't hesitate to call.

09:41.506 --> 09:43.739
Okay. All right.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.014
You don't think
anything's wrong?

09:52.016 --> 09:54.650
Really?

09:59.389 --> 10:00.523
I wake up to tears every night,

10:00.525 --> 10:02.091
and they're not coming
from the baby.

10:02.093 --> 10:04.627
At the moment, there isn't
much else we can do.

10:04.629 --> 10:05.928
Can't you give him something?

10:05.930 --> 10:07.797
Not if he says
he doesn't need it.

10:07.799 --> 10:08.931
Look, if he doesn't
stop weeping,

10:08.933 --> 10:10.399
I'm gonna stick my head
in that blender

10:10.401 --> 10:11.534
just so I don't have
to hear it.

10:11.536 --> 10:14.337
Try these first.

10:14.339 --> 10:18.040
Ear plugs.
Huh.

10:20.978 --> 10:23.980
See?
You do have the right tools.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.122
Come over tonight.
I'll make dinner.

10:33.124 --> 10:35.358
I have this Russian cookbook
that's been useless to me

10:35.360 --> 10:37.393
without a translator.

10:37.395 --> 10:41.130
Come over to your guesthouse
at shadow pond.

10:41.132 --> 10:42.999
Unfortunately,
that's the only guesthouse

10:43.001 --> 10:44.867
I have at the moment.

10:44.869 --> 10:47.803
How about room service instead?

10:47.805 --> 10:49.372
In your hotel?

10:49.374 --> 10:51.607
Unfortunately, I can't get them

10:51.609 --> 10:53.242
to bring food to me
anywhere else.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.545
This is a nice car.

10:56.547 --> 10:58.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.751
So Sam...
What's her deal?

11:01.753 --> 11:03.352
Who is she?
What does she do?

11:03.354 --> 11:05.087
I don't think
she's retainer material.

11:05.089 --> 11:07.056
Are you kidding?
She drives a Ferrari.

11:07.058 --> 11:08.824
The ring on her finger
was the size of a...

11:08.826 --> 11:10.092
Lot of money.

11:10.094 --> 11:12.762
Yeah, I know, but...

11:12.764 --> 11:15.498
Ah, yes. Well...

11:15.500 --> 11:18.601
Yes. Hi.

11:18.603 --> 11:20.669
Evan. R. Lawson,
I'm the cfo of Hankmed.

11:20.671 --> 11:22.705
And Hank's only brother,
actually.

11:22.707 --> 11:24.240
- Christina.
- Christina.

11:24.242 --> 11:27.309
Christina.
Hank's never mentioned you.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.311
Don't take that personally,
though,

11:29.313 --> 11:31.514
because Hank doesn't
tell me anything.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.616
He does play it
close to the vest.

11:33.618 --> 11:35.217
Don't I, though?

11:35.219 --> 11:37.787
Yeah, sometimes a little
too close for my taste.

11:37.789 --> 11:39.488
So how did you guys meet?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.090
Wewe were... it was a...

11:41.092 --> 11:42.892
we have a mutual acquaintance.

11:42.894 --> 11:45.027
That's it.
We have a mutual acquaintance.

11:45.029 --> 11:46.729
Oh, it's a mutual acquaintance.

11:46.731 --> 11:50.933
Yeah, it is an acquaintance
that is, in fact... Mutual.

11:50.935 --> 11:55.704
Oh, you, uh...
you like what you see?

11:55.706 --> 11:58.941
I am such an Aston Martin girl.

11:58.943 --> 12:00.409
Really?
That's... that's good news.

12:00.411 --> 12:01.544
That's one less person
to compete against

12:01.546 --> 12:03.012
in the Ferrari raffle, right?

12:03.014 --> 12:05.514
Right.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.149
I guess you are being summoned.

12:07.151 --> 12:08.250
I am.

12:08.252 --> 12:09.785
So she knows about

12:09.787 --> 12:12.088
the house arrest
beeper-watch as well?

12:12.090 --> 12:14.623
- Yeah.
- Wow, so...

12:14.625 --> 12:16.125
When's the wedding, Henry?

12:16.127 --> 12:18.294
And am I even invited to it?

12:18.296 --> 12:20.396
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

12:20.398 --> 12:21.764
Mwah!

12:21.766 --> 12:22.698
Don't answer any
of his questions.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.266
Bond, just don't talk.

12:24.268 --> 12:27.169
Wha...

12:35.579 --> 12:38.547
Boris.
I got your page.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.150
Dmitry's local doctors
wanted to thank you

12:41.152 --> 12:43.419
for the medical records
you sent.

12:43.421 --> 12:46.455
It seems our Russian friend
is getting a new liver.

12:46.457 --> 12:48.891
He got on the transplant list.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.826
That seems premature.

12:50.828 --> 12:52.528
He's not in liver failure.
List?

12:52.530 --> 12:55.531
Dmitry's not the type
to queue up, wouldn't you say?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.766
Much less wait for failure.

12:57.768 --> 13:00.269
I'll give his internist a call.

13:00.271 --> 13:02.071
I trust you had a pleasant
evening with Christina

13:02.073 --> 13:05.074
before she left?

13:05.076 --> 13:06.709
She's still in the Hamptons,

13:06.711 --> 13:09.378
but I'm guessing
you already know that.

13:09.380 --> 13:13.516
Hank, I don't foresee
Christina settling down

13:13.518 --> 13:17.386
with a...
A country doctor.

13:17.388 --> 13:18.888
You set me up with her.

13:18.890 --> 13:23.526
Yeah, I wanted you two
to have a nice dinner.

13:23.528 --> 13:27.363
Never imagined
that she'd stay past dessert.

13:27.365 --> 13:30.566
At least not the Christina
I know.

13:30.568 --> 13:31.967
Are we done here?

13:31.969 --> 13:33.669
Hank, I'm sure
I needn't remind you,

13:33.671 --> 13:35.271
if she asks any questions
about me...

13:35.273 --> 13:36.772
believe me, your name
hasn't come up.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.574
And I don't expect it to.

13:42.346 --> 13:44.680
Just be careful, Hank.

13:46.983 --> 13:49.752
I'll call Dmitry's doctor now.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.438
Is Hank picking up
his schedule,

13:59.440 --> 14:00.973
or does he need me
to email it to him?

14:00.975 --> 14:02.841
Who knows what he's doing?
He sure doesn't tell me.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.944
Very helpful.
I'll go call him.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.479
Bye, guys.

14:07.481 --> 14:08.781
Oh, no, wait.
You know what?

14:08.783 --> 14:10.215
We should, uh...
we should talk for one second

14:10.217 --> 14:11.517
about your share
of the raffle ticket.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.185
Raffle ticket?

14:13.187 --> 14:15.087
Yes, for the soon-to-be
Hankmed Ferrari.

14:15.089 --> 14:17.890
You got the memo, right?
I thought it was a joke.

14:17.892 --> 14:19.992
Did you also think
it was a joke?

14:19.994 --> 14:22.194
I did not.
But in Divya's defense,

14:22.196 --> 14:24.863
tone is notoriously hard
to decipher in emails.

14:24.865 --> 14:28.067
Great. So you're in
for 20%?

14:28.069 --> 14:31.203
Oh... No. Sorry.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.671
Let me guess, you think
a Ferrari is

14:32.673 --> 14:33.939
an impractical mode
of transportation.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.241
No, it's just...

14:36.243 --> 14:38.010
statistically,
you think the odds

14:38.012 --> 14:39.545
don't justify the price.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.013
No, it's not about
the probabilities.

14:41.015 --> 14:44.349
Not to be so cfo, but,
Divya, this is for 40%.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.718
Yes. I'm covering
Jeremiah.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.553
Just please stop talking
to us about it.

14:47.555 --> 14:49.288
Okay, great. Awesome.
Moving on.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.856
So, Jeremiah, you are
following up with Mr. small?

14:50.858 --> 14:52.191
Yes, he is.

14:52.193 --> 14:54.893
But, uh, didn't he say
he was fine?

14:54.895 --> 14:57.496
Well, men with depression
often deny their symptoms.

14:57.498 --> 14:59.631
Also, I saw him drinking
a protein shake.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.333
Perhaps a soy-based protein.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.102
Well, evidence of soy
increasing estrogen

15:03.104 --> 15:04.870
is anecdotal.

15:04.872 --> 15:07.172
Yes, I know, but it isn't
always about the science.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.208
Sometimes we need
to encourage dialogue

15:09.210 --> 15:12.244
with our new patients
until they trust us.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.445
There's something
going on with JJ,

15:13.447 --> 15:14.947
and I am sure
that you are going

15:14.949 --> 15:15.881
to get to the bottom of it.

15:15.883 --> 15:17.149
Wait, his name is JJ?

15:17.151 --> 15:19.318
Mr. small is JJ small?

15:19.320 --> 15:21.620
The defending UFM champion?

15:21.622 --> 15:23.322
The bad boy of MMA?

15:23.324 --> 15:24.990
MMA?

15:24.992 --> 15:27.059
The brutal combat sport
in which caged men fight

15:27.061 --> 15:28.160
to near death.

15:28.162 --> 15:29.895
"MMA" stands
for mixed martial arts.

15:29.897 --> 15:31.630
Exactly.

15:31.632 --> 15:34.233
I ordered it on-demand
by mistake.

15:34.235 --> 15:38.036
I thought it was a special on
the medicare modernization act.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.674
It must be a different
JJ small.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.543
Our patient is quite
mild-mannered.

15:44.545 --> 15:47.513
This your patient?

15:47.515 --> 15:50.716
Oh, my God, why does he
have blood all over his face?

15:50.718 --> 15:52.151
Oh, you should have seen
the other guy.

15:52.153 --> 15:53.452
Guess how many copies
that sold.

15:53.454 --> 15:55.053
Half a million
in the first week.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.022
Yeah. Try half a million
in the first week.

15:57.024 --> 16:01.193
JJ small, he's a superstar,
and he's a barbarian.

16:01.195 --> 16:03.462
He's got a huge fight
this weekend at Nassau coliseum.

16:03.464 --> 16:04.763
It's the first time
an MMA fight's ever been allowed

16:04.765 --> 16:05.831
in New York.

16:05.833 --> 16:06.865
Probably gonna be the last too

16:06.867 --> 16:08.500
after he's done with Jason sol,

16:08.502 --> 16:10.335
short, little bastard.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.571
Evan. Evan!

16:12.573 --> 16:15.274
Does he ever get hit
in the head when he is fighting?

16:15.276 --> 16:17.075
Do you ever use your accent
when you're speaking?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.478
He could have
a traumatic brain injury.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.146
Which could be causing
his disproportionate

16:21.148 --> 16:22.447
emotional displays.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.715
We need to follow up
right away.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.519
Does this mean he's not
gonna fight Jason sol?

16:32.392 --> 16:35.994
I'm starting to get used
to this Hamptons lifestyle.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.531
Leaving will be harder
than I expected.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.939
Then take your time leaving.

16:46.941 --> 16:49.408
I wish I could.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.677
So do I.

16:51.679 --> 16:54.012
This is starting to feel
like more than just some fun

16:54.014 --> 16:56.114
over poker and <i>wohdka.</i>

17:01.254 --> 17:04.189
So do you think Boris is going
to Istanbul in a few weeks?

17:04.191 --> 17:07.826
His villa there
is pretty amazing.

17:07.828 --> 17:12.830
Um, you really want
to talk about Boris right now?

17:12.833 --> 17:15.367
Personally, I'd rather leave
our pasts behind us.

17:15.368 --> 17:19.003
Hank, that was just
my not-so-subtle way

17:19.006 --> 17:20.806
of asking
when I'll see you again.

17:20.808 --> 17:26.878
I was hoping that Boris
might bring you along.

17:26.881 --> 17:29.815
Right. Right.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.697
I'm sure he'd want you there

17:45.699 --> 17:48.667
with Dmitry facing
a liver transplant.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.025
JJ, I'm so sorry
to interrupt you.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.628
Really? Now?

18:16.630 --> 18:19.598
- Please?
- One sec.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.134
All right, let's go.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.407
Okay, now I'm good.

18:28.409 --> 18:30.175
You look great.

18:30.177 --> 18:33.345
Thank you.

18:33.347 --> 18:37.649
Okay, over my career I've had,
like, five broken ribs,

18:37.651 --> 18:39.785
a punctured lung,
and three concussions.

18:39.787 --> 18:41.453
Do you guys count
pinky fractures?

18:41.455 --> 18:43.055
'Cause I don't count
the pinkies.

18:43.057 --> 18:45.190
Why did you tell me
that you hadn't had

18:45.192 --> 18:46.758
any serious injuries?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.827
'Cause in my line of work,
"serious" is a relative term.

18:48.829 --> 18:50.762
Hey, Schwann, man, I'm really
sorry about that, buddy.

18:50.764 --> 18:52.230
- No problem, JJ.
- Okay?

18:52.232 --> 18:52.998
I'll call and check up
on you later, all right?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.232
Thanks, buddy.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.334
Hey, could you do me a favor?

18:55.336 --> 18:56.601
Can you put his nose on my tab?

18:56.603 --> 18:59.671
JJ, I am concerned
about your history

18:59.673 --> 19:01.473
of concussive head injuries.

19:01.475 --> 19:02.941
Yeah, I appreciate that,
but it doesn't seem to be

19:02.943 --> 19:04.443
causing me any problems.

19:04.445 --> 19:07.145
It could be the reason
for your... for your crying jags.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.048
Or maybe because I got a lot
going on right now.

19:10.050 --> 19:11.316
I mean, I am trying to prep

19:11.318 --> 19:12.918
for one of the biggest fights
of my career.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.854
JJ...

19:15.856 --> 19:17.622
You and I are not sparring.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.359
You can let your guard down
with me.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.098
It's Heather, okay?
She's concerned.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.533
She worries so much about me.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.068
Like this crying,
it starts out of the blue,

19:30.070 --> 19:31.436
and I can't control it.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.904
But that doesn't mean
I don't want to... I do.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.406
I believe you.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.608
Which is why we want
to do an mri of your head

19:36.610 --> 19:38.643
so that we can check
for any damage.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.847
I get it, but not now.
Tomorrow's the weigh-in.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.582
So?

19:43.584 --> 19:46.718
So? The weigh-in is
just as big as the fight itself.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.153
I mean, it's where we face off

19:48.155 --> 19:49.454
and try to psych
each other out.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.089
It's the last and the biggest
media frenzy

19:51.091 --> 19:52.624
of the whole event.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.126
It's why I rented this house
in the Hamptons,

19:54.128 --> 19:55.961
and why I gotta keep my head
in the game right now,

19:55.963 --> 19:57.396
and not some machine.

19:57.398 --> 19:59.831
You're also a new father.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.700
If you've had
concussive injuries,

20:01.702 --> 20:03.235
one more blow to your head
could cause

20:03.237 --> 20:06.338
permanent brain damage.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.907
This mri isn't just for you.

20:08.909 --> 20:14.413
I mean, you have to stay safe
for... for triple-j.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.154
Yeah, you're right.

20:22.156 --> 20:25.590
Maybe I did have
one fight too many.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.797
I coulda... I could have retired
three championships ago.

20:31.799 --> 20:34.466
You think it's too late for me?

20:34.468 --> 20:38.203
In my line of work,
"too late" is a relative term.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.919
Hi.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.921
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.956
Can't get enough of her.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.558
If Magnum P.I. Were
still working today,

20:59.560 --> 21:00.959
this is the car
he'd be driving.

21:00.961 --> 21:02.761
Mm.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.200
And she's next to this.

21:08.202 --> 21:11.103
Now, this...

21:11.105 --> 21:12.871
This is basically
the automotive equivalent

21:12.873 --> 21:15.340
of a roided-out meathead
at the club

21:15.342 --> 21:17.342
who's, like...

21:17.344 --> 21:18.977
"Come on, it's money."

21:18.979 --> 21:20.312
And she's the girl
he's trying to hit on,

21:20.314 --> 21:22.314
who's, like,
"ha ha ha... No."

21:22.316 --> 21:24.983
You really like Ferraris.

21:24.985 --> 21:26.785
I do. Yeah.

21:26.787 --> 21:27.986
When I was a kid,
my dad always said

21:27.988 --> 21:28.954
we'd have one one day.

21:28.956 --> 21:31.223
He was a bit of a dreamer.

21:31.225 --> 21:32.557
I didn't know that
at the time, though.

21:32.559 --> 21:36.061
So he kinda made me into
a bit of a dreamer too, I guess.

21:36.063 --> 21:37.429
Well, maybe one day.

21:37.431 --> 21:40.932
Seems like you have
a really solid business idea.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.367
It's funny
you should mention that, Sam.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.536
So I've been thinking,

21:44.538 --> 21:46.605
if you were a Hankmed
retainer client...

21:46.607 --> 21:49.174
oh, you know what, you can
just save your salesmanship

21:49.176 --> 21:51.276
because I'm just in town
for the rally.

21:51.278 --> 21:53.879
Totally get it.
But just so you know,

21:53.881 --> 21:55.947
we also have
a Hankmed traveler's package,

21:55.949 --> 21:58.350
which, uh...
which is designed specifically

21:58.352 --> 22:00.852
for on-the-go vips,
such as yourself.

22:00.854 --> 22:02.187
Actually, there's
a clause in here

22:02.189 --> 22:05.357
specifically for... whoa!
Watch out.

22:05.359 --> 22:06.992
Aah!

22:13.199 --> 22:14.466
What can I do for you, Hank?

22:18.405 --> 22:22.674
Did you tell Christina
about Dmitry's liver transplant?

22:22.676 --> 22:25.544
I did not.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.982
Then we need to talk.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.553
You're lucky, Sam.

22:36.555 --> 22:39.222
Other than a small laceration
and some pretty good bruising,

22:39.224 --> 22:40.790
you'll be fine.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.759
You sure you're all right,
Evan?

22:42.761 --> 22:44.994
Me?
Yeah, I'm great.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.863
I just can't believe that car
heard what I said about it

22:46.865 --> 22:48.198
and tried to strike back.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.533
But thank you again
for saving my head,

22:50.535 --> 22:51.668
by the way.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.336
You have lightning-fast
reflexes too.

22:53.338 --> 22:56.005
Were you, like, a ninja
in a former life or something?

22:56.007 --> 22:58.074
Okay, ev, don't you have
a raffle ticket to go buy?

22:58.076 --> 23:00.343
Bought.
Now just pray for us.

23:00.345 --> 23:02.112
I'm praying.
Don't you have anything else

23:02.114 --> 23:03.480
you can go do?

23:03.482 --> 23:05.315
I could go check out Ferrari's
new line of accessories.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.583
I hear the sportswear
collection for men

23:06.585 --> 23:08.218
just introduced
a very distinguished...

23:08.220 --> 23:10.820
great.
Go do that, then.

23:10.822 --> 23:13.056
Oh, you just want me to...

23:13.058 --> 23:17.460
yeah, I kinda want you to...

23:17.462 --> 23:19.496
- You coulda just said that.
- I did. Three times.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.865
I think it was
actually twice, but whatever.

23:21.867 --> 23:25.635
The door.

23:25.637 --> 23:29.239
Sorry about that.
About him.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.740
Oh, actually, it helps to have

23:30.742 --> 23:32.909
a bit of unpredictability
around.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.210
Keeps me on my toes.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.278
Yeah, he's good at that.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.581
I've lived on my toes
for 30 years.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.450
I'm worried, Hank.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.019
This isn't the first time
I've been clumsy lately.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.287
Okay, let me take a look.

23:45.923 --> 23:48.424
Here, hold your hands up.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.127
Okay, now,
push against my hands.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.630
Good.
Pull towards you.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.632
Okay, good.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.967
Grab my fingers.

23:57.969 --> 24:00.937
Okay, now squeeze.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.905
Okay.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.140
Uh, can you feel that?

24:04.142 --> 24:05.875
Yeah.

24:05.877 --> 24:08.211
Do both sides feel
the same, or different?

24:08.213 --> 24:09.312
Same.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.447
Okay.

24:11.449 --> 24:13.383
I'm not sure what's causing
your tremors, but...

24:13.385 --> 24:14.918
this is just
what happened with John

24:14.920 --> 24:16.452
right before it got really bad.

24:16.454 --> 24:19.122
John your partner John?

24:19.124 --> 24:21.825
He wasn't just my partner.

24:21.827 --> 24:24.594
Oh.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.964
People say not
to bring your work home,

24:27.966 --> 24:30.867
but undercover work
isn't just a job.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.068
It's a whole new identity.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.904
Relationships get complicated,

24:34.906 --> 24:38.775
and... I found the complicated
love of my life.

24:40.778 --> 24:43.847
Anyway, John told me never
to give up on a case,

24:43.849 --> 24:46.049
to see everything through
to the end.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.484
Which is exactly
what I intend to do.

24:48.486 --> 24:51.554
Sam, I've done some reading
on meth toxicity,

24:51.556 --> 24:54.390
and nearly every case I saw
resulted from repeat exposure.

24:54.392 --> 24:56.926
But one really bad exposure
could do it.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.995
Yes, it could.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.064
But all your blood panels
came back negative,

25:01.066 --> 25:02.232
which is a good sign.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.633
So I'd like to do
a full-body ct

25:03.635 --> 25:05.702
and just keep looking
for other causes.

25:05.704 --> 25:10.039
Okay.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.475
I'll go with you
to the hospital...

25:16.180 --> 25:19.716
As soon
as my replacement arrives.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.184
Thanks.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.052
Yeah.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.757
JJ's findings look good.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.026
No sign of post-concussive
syndrome.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.895
I was hoping to find
an indisputable reason

25:31.897 --> 25:34.764
that he shouldn't
fight any more.

25:34.766 --> 25:38.601
I don't want him to be unwell,
just retired.

25:38.603 --> 25:41.037
But isn't that judging
your patient's behavior?

25:41.039 --> 25:43.139
I thought you had evolved
past that.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.008
I said I began to evolve.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.377
I'm still a work
in progress too.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.847
Thank you for your honesty.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.583
Especially since...
Here, look at this.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.652
Is that a slight loss
of neurons in the hippocampus?

25:55.654 --> 25:56.853
Huh.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.388
He's not in any danger,

25:58.390 --> 25:59.989
though his career may be.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.791
He's at the weigh-in
right now.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.359
We should probably
get over there fast,

26:03.361 --> 26:05.228
before he suffers
another emotional episode.

26:05.230 --> 26:09.032
It seems that you're feeling

26:09.034 --> 26:10.900
more comfortable
with your patient already.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.702
Yeah, I always feel
more comfortable with emotion

26:12.704 --> 26:15.071
when it has a specific
neurological explanation.

26:16.941 --> 26:18.675
Yeah.

26:27.718 --> 26:28.952
So I've already
worked out a schedule.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.987
Each of us will get the car
one day a week.

26:30.989 --> 26:34.691
Paige already has Thursdays,
so I will take Fridays.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.292
Which makes sense because,
obviously,

26:36.294 --> 26:37.493
I'll be looking after it
on Saturdays and Sundays.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.696
- Obviously.
- And, as the last to chip in,

26:39.698 --> 26:42.231
you will most likely
get mondays,

26:42.233 --> 26:45.668
which is also wash and wax day,
just so you know.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.171
And speaking of,
you still owe me your 20%.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.339
I don't know where
you got the idea

26:49.341 --> 26:50.773
I was going in
on a Ferrari lotto with you.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.442
I mean, it's absurd, Evan.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.645
Okay, it's not absurd.
Excuse me.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.313
What?

26:57.315 --> 27:02.418
Did you just ignore miss
"I'm such an Aston Martin girl"?

27:02.420 --> 27:03.653
She shouldn't take it
personally.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.154
I'm ignoring you too.

27:05.156 --> 27:08.358
So what's up
with you and her anyway?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.193
Henry?

27:10.195 --> 27:11.494
Oh, come on!

27:11.496 --> 27:12.362
I used to tell you
about every girl I met,

27:12.364 --> 27:13.930
like, the second I met her.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.232
I used to tell you about girls
I fantasized about meeting.

27:16.234 --> 27:17.834
Just give me the <i>cliffsnotes.</i>

27:17.836 --> 27:20.003
The <i>cliffsnotes</i> just aren't
available on this one, okay?

27:20.005 --> 27:22.572
Henry, come on,

27:22.574 --> 27:24.407
talk to your little brother
about your girl troubles.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.275
As the one with more
relationship experience

27:26.277 --> 27:27.543
these days, I'd be happy
to shed some light

27:27.545 --> 27:28.611
on the female condition
for you.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.246
There's a reason Paige calls me

27:30.248 --> 27:31.514
"the fiance whisperer."

27:31.516 --> 27:33.416
Oh, what will it take
to shut you up?

27:33.418 --> 27:35.451
- Your 20%.
- Done. You got it.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.187
Nice doing business with you.

27:41.058 --> 27:43.393
And his opponent,
hailing from utica, New York,

27:43.395 --> 27:45.028
coming in with a record
of 22-1,

27:45.030 --> 27:47.964
including ten knockouts
and five submissions,

27:47.966 --> 27:51.234
ladies and gentlemen, JJ small!

27:54.873 --> 28:00.676
JJ's official fight weight
is 182 pounds.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.081
- Hey.
- Do you have JJ's mri results?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.050
We do.
He's not post-concussive.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.351
But we do know what it is,

28:08.353 --> 28:10.053
and the good news
is we can treat it.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.354
Well, I wish you got here
five minutes earlier

28:11.356 --> 28:13.723
because he's about to have
a breakdown onstage.

28:15.426 --> 28:16.926
This is a disaster.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.895
If he sheds a tear,
he'll be a laughing stock.

28:18.897 --> 28:21.230
His career will be ruined.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.802
Look at him.
We have to do something.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.537
We have to stop this.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.926
Dr. Sacani,
what got into you?

29:00.928 --> 29:02.294
Come again?

29:02.296 --> 29:05.331
I said, "what got into you?"

29:05.333 --> 29:07.599
The button said,
"push in case of emergency."

29:07.601 --> 29:09.435
We had an ill patient
under duress.

29:09.437 --> 29:11.437
Nicely done.

29:11.439 --> 29:13.305
Talk about saved by the bell.

29:14.976 --> 29:16.475
So where were we, medically?

29:16.477 --> 29:20.145
JJ, your mri showed a loss
of neurons in the hippocampus,

29:20.147 --> 29:22.214
an absence that can cause
dyscratic seizures.

29:22.216 --> 29:25.384
It's a neurological disorder
called pseudobulbar affect,

29:25.386 --> 29:26.919
or pba.

29:26.921 --> 29:28.354
It occurs when the area
of the brain

29:28.356 --> 29:30.155
that controls
the normal expression of emotion

29:30.157 --> 29:31.724
is impaired.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.659
Okay, so how did I get
this pba?

29:33.661 --> 29:35.728
Oh, it's
an idiopathic phenomenon.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.297
Which is medical
for no one really knows.

29:38.299 --> 29:39.798
But there is no reason to think

29:39.800 --> 29:42.868
that it is related
to your career.

29:42.870 --> 29:44.837
It would have manifested itself

29:44.839 --> 29:46.839
no matter what your line
of work.

29:46.841 --> 29:48.440
What do we do about it?

29:48.442 --> 29:51.643
This injection of lorazepam

29:51.645 --> 29:53.846
will temporarily control
the emotion

29:53.848 --> 29:56.081
and allow you to complete
the weigh-in with your opponent.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.417
- Okay.
- Expose your right shoulder.

29:58.419 --> 30:00.285
Yes. It's so good
to hear, you guys.

30:00.287 --> 30:02.621
Thank you so much.
It's all clear, everybody.

30:02.623 --> 30:04.490
They need my delicate
little flower back in there.

30:04.492 --> 30:06.925
Little pinch.

30:06.927 --> 30:10.529
How long does this take
to kick in?

30:15.368 --> 30:18.837
I love you.

30:18.839 --> 30:21.106
That'll work.

30:26.012 --> 30:27.546
Ladies and gentlemen,
make your way over

30:27.548 --> 30:28.814
to the Ferrari ff

30:28.816 --> 30:32.384
for the announcement
of its new owner.

30:32.386 --> 30:35.521
Excuse us.
Ticket holder. Thanks.

30:35.523 --> 30:39.892
Hello, baby.

30:39.894 --> 30:43.128
The winner of this year's
Hamptons speed rally

30:43.130 --> 30:45.497
charity raffle is...

30:45.499 --> 30:47.800
Please. Please.

30:50.270 --> 30:52.137
- Evelyn Larson!
- Yes!

30:52.139 --> 30:54.506
- I won!
- Yes! Yes!

30:54.508 --> 30:55.941
- Evan!
- I can't believe I won it.

30:55.943 --> 30:57.142
What?

30:57.144 --> 30:58.143
He didn't say
"Evan R. Lawson."

30:58.145 --> 31:00.579
He said "Evelyn Larson."

31:00.581 --> 31:02.014
No, he did...
he... he...

31:02.016 --> 31:04.183
who the...

31:04.185 --> 31:06.151
congratulations, Evelyn Larson.

31:06.153 --> 31:07.553
Evelyn Larson?

31:07.555 --> 31:09.321
What the hell kind
of name is that?

31:09.323 --> 31:10.722
There's always
next year's raffle.

31:10.724 --> 31:12.157
And the charity wins
either way.

31:12.159 --> 31:13.358
She's sitting in my car, Paige.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.893
Hey, good for you.

31:14.895 --> 31:17.029
Now you can drive yourself
to bingo night.

31:17.031 --> 31:20.599
All right, cool.
At up to 193 Miles per hour.

31:20.601 --> 31:22.968
All right.
Excuse me.

31:22.970 --> 31:24.103
That's the spirit.

31:24.105 --> 31:27.339
Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:30.443 --> 31:32.511
Uh, Sam?
What are you doing?

31:32.513 --> 31:33.946
This was getting in my way.

31:33.948 --> 31:35.681
I told you I can't have
my shooting hand tied up.

31:35.683 --> 31:39.585
- But it hasn't had time to he...
- Oh, my God.

31:39.587 --> 31:41.220
No, no, no.
Sam?

31:41.222 --> 31:43.088
Sam, what's going on?
I can't lose him now.

31:43.090 --> 31:44.423
Your suspect?

31:44.425 --> 31:46.758
What are you doing?
My job.

31:46.760 --> 31:50.762
Sam, you're not thinking
clearly.

31:50.764 --> 31:51.797
Hang on.

31:53.399 --> 31:55.501
Hey, get back here!

31:55.503 --> 31:56.602
Sam, stop the car.

31:56.604 --> 31:57.703
If you chase him,

31:57.705 --> 31:59.171
it'll blow your cover.

31:59.173 --> 32:02.508
Whoa, whoa, Sam.
Sam, look out! Sam!

32:02.510 --> 32:04.476
Hank, he's getting away
from me.

32:04.478 --> 32:06.645
- Sam, slow down.
- No.

32:06.647 --> 32:09.414
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

32:13.720 --> 32:15.254
Sam, listen to me.

32:15.256 --> 32:16.455
You're not in your right mind
right now.

32:16.457 --> 32:17.890
I gotta get this guy, Hank.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.491
Hit the brakes!

32:23.930 --> 32:27.199
Oh, my God, what just happened?

32:27.201 --> 32:29.101
Wow, Sam.

32:29.103 --> 32:31.203
I can't believe
I just did that.

32:31.205 --> 32:33.038
Whoa...

32:33.040 --> 32:35.741
I'm trained to be calm
and calculating, not impulsive.

32:35.743 --> 32:37.109
What's happening to me, Hank?

32:37.111 --> 32:38.777
I'm not sure,
but irrational behavior

32:38.779 --> 32:40.179
is probably a symptom.

32:40.181 --> 32:42.381
My replacement's
supposed to come tomorrow.

32:42.383 --> 32:45.117
I think I better
move up the schedule.

32:45.119 --> 32:46.652
Yeah, I think
that might be wise.

32:46.654 --> 32:50.122
Thanks for being here, Hank.

32:50.124 --> 32:54.326
You saved that waitress's life.

32:54.328 --> 32:56.361
Even if it's too late
to save mine.

32:56.363 --> 32:59.598
Actually, Sam...
I don't think it is.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.900
What
what are you talking about?

33:01.902 --> 33:06.071
The kf rings
around your irises.

33:06.073 --> 33:07.806
What, the problem
is in my eyes?

33:07.808 --> 33:09.875
Actually, it could be anywhere.

33:09.877 --> 33:12.911
Your body's been poisoned,
but not by meth.

33:12.913 --> 33:15.414
We have to get to the hospital
right now.

33:15.416 --> 33:18.083
Uh, I'll drive.
Okay.

33:25.459 --> 33:28.093
Ooh, yeah.

33:28.095 --> 33:30.929
That man must have a stage three
complete ligament rupture

33:30.931 --> 33:33.198
with joint dislocation
between his humerus and ulna.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.766
No, it's just
a really nice armbar.

33:34.768 --> 33:36.768
And he just escaped.
See?

33:36.770 --> 33:41.273
So, um, tell me,
did JJ have a Ferrari?

33:41.275 --> 33:43.408
No, what am I doing?
It's too hard.

33:43.410 --> 33:46.311
Never mind. Ugh!

33:46.313 --> 33:49.281
God... Evelyn Larson?

33:49.283 --> 33:51.483
Her name
was Evelyn freakin' Larson!

33:51.485 --> 33:53.552
Evan!

33:53.554 --> 33:56.421
Maybe it's time
you give up the dream.

33:56.423 --> 33:58.123
You know, at least for now.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.825
I think it's bringing back
your childhood

33:59.827 --> 34:00.993
in more ways than one.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.729
Let's go.
Come on.

34:03.731 --> 34:05.464
Okay, okay, I have seen enough

34:05.466 --> 34:07.833
ankle locks
and guillotine chokes for today.

34:07.835 --> 34:09.400
Maybe we should have lied
and told him

34:09.402 --> 34:11.536
he had a head injury,
'cause clearly, someday he will.

34:11.538 --> 34:14.572
Hemorrhagic stroke,
cerebral edema,

34:14.574 --> 34:17.909
parkinsonism for sure.
Mmhmm.

34:24.717 --> 34:26.385
Okay, so now he's got his back.

34:26.387 --> 34:29.288
Okay, so...
so the guy at the back

34:29.290 --> 34:30.856
is gonna try to jump on
like a monkey.

34:30.858 --> 34:33.525
See, there you go.
Now he's gonna get his legs in.

34:33.527 --> 34:35.694
Legs locked.

34:35.696 --> 34:37.295
You know, his hooks are in.

34:37.297 --> 34:39.031
Two hands on one.
He's trying to get out.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.533
Rear naked choke.

34:41.534 --> 34:43.168
Rear naked choke...
oh!

34:43.170 --> 34:44.202
He slammed him
right on his head!

34:44.204 --> 34:45.370
Now he's punching him
in the face.

34:49.542 --> 34:52.110
- Divya.
- Yes?

34:52.112 --> 34:58.016
I wanted to thank you, um,
for helping me, well, with JJ.

34:58.018 --> 35:01.219
For helping me evolve.

35:01.221 --> 35:03.789
It was my pleasure.

35:03.791 --> 35:06.625
And my hat's off to you
for confronting that challenge.

35:06.627 --> 35:08.126
You were terrific.

35:11.964 --> 35:14.199
Would you like
to go eat now together?

35:14.201 --> 35:18.337
Thanks to our patient,
I've lost my appetite.

35:18.339 --> 35:22.607
Oh, actually, uh...
I'd be willing...

35:22.609 --> 35:23.809
oh, my God!

35:23.811 --> 35:25.177
Oh, my God, it's over.

35:25.179 --> 35:27.279
Guys, come here!
JJ won.

35:40.026 --> 35:44.296
So the ct and blood tests
both confirmed Wilson's disease.

35:44.298 --> 35:46.231
It's a...
Genetic disorder

35:46.233 --> 35:48.066
in which copper accumulates
in body tissue.

35:48.068 --> 35:50.736
In my case, in the brain,
and can cause

35:50.738 --> 35:53.038
fatigue, tremors,
irrational behavior...

35:53.040 --> 35:54.406
all my symptoms.

35:54.408 --> 35:56.975
Nice investigative work.

35:56.977 --> 35:59.077
I guess you also know
what made it accumulate now?

35:59.079 --> 36:00.512
It's been accumulating
my whole life,

36:00.514 --> 36:02.047
and the symptoms
only started now

36:02.049 --> 36:04.416
because the accumulation
had reached a crisis level.

36:04.418 --> 36:06.418
Very impressive.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.920
Chelation pills will help
remove the excess copper

36:08.922 --> 36:10.555
that your body wasn't able
to metabolize,

36:10.557 --> 36:13.191
and the zinc will ensure
that this never happens again.

36:13.193 --> 36:15.193
So where did the copper
come from?

36:15.195 --> 36:17.963
Copper's in a lot of normal,
everyday things we consume,

36:17.965 --> 36:20.132
like oysters and chocolate.

36:20.134 --> 36:22.901
Okay, my two favorite
food groups.

36:22.903 --> 36:25.137
So this was addiction-related
in a way.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.773
In a way, but not related
to meth exposure.

36:27.775 --> 36:29.007
It would have manifested itself

36:29.009 --> 36:30.776
no matter
what your line of work.

36:30.778 --> 36:34.880
Speaking of my job,
when can I get back to it?

36:34.882 --> 36:36.982
When's your suspect's
next rally?

36:36.984 --> 36:39.184
Labor day weekend in Miami.

36:39.186 --> 36:41.019
Good think you didn't blow
your cover, Sam.

36:41.021 --> 36:43.321
Thanks to you.

36:43.323 --> 36:46.558
So I guess I'll just have
to keep wondering

36:46.560 --> 36:50.896
what your real name is?

36:53.699 --> 36:56.001
- Hank...
- Yeah.

36:56.003 --> 36:57.469
You saved my life.

36:57.471 --> 37:00.005
I don't want you to live
in curiosity forever.

37:00.007 --> 37:03.208
That just wouldn't be fair.

37:03.210 --> 37:04.843
I'll call you when I retire.

37:04.845 --> 37:07.846
Great.

37:07.848 --> 37:09.414
I'll look forward to that call.

37:09.416 --> 37:12.317
Okay.

37:21.727 --> 37:23.094
Sorry I couldn't
meet you earlier.

37:23.096 --> 37:24.162
I had an emergency.

37:24.164 --> 37:29.000
I had
an unexpected situation too.

37:29.002 --> 37:30.635
Boris fired me...

37:30.637 --> 37:34.372
And said you'd be able
to explain why.

37:34.374 --> 37:37.108
Oh, he did, did he?

37:37.110 --> 37:40.745
Well, I assume it's because
you were talking to Dmitry

37:40.747 --> 37:42.414
behind Boris's back.

37:42.416 --> 37:45.150
Look, loyalty isn't something
Boris takes lightly.

37:45.152 --> 37:48.286
When the summit ended,
so did my work for Boris.

37:48.288 --> 37:50.155
Dmitry was happy
with my services

37:50.157 --> 37:51.890
and hired me
for an upcoming trip.

37:51.892 --> 37:54.559
Oh.

37:54.561 --> 37:56.795
Did you explain that to Boris?

37:56.797 --> 37:58.330
I did,
and Boris doesn't like it.

37:58.332 --> 38:01.933
But Boris doesn't own me
the way he owns so many others.

38:01.935 --> 38:04.536
Look, I was getting
mixed messages, Christina.

38:04.538 --> 38:06.271
So you assumed the worst.

38:06.273 --> 38:08.540
You treated me like a spy
and a liar

38:08.542 --> 38:10.609
when all you had to do
was ask me.

38:10.611 --> 38:13.144
You're right.

38:13.146 --> 38:14.679
And I'm sorry.

38:14.681 --> 38:16.181
I guess I'm still learning
this game

38:16.183 --> 38:18.016
that seems to come
so naturally to the rest of you.

38:18.018 --> 38:20.752
Maybe your brother
was right, Hank.

38:20.754 --> 38:24.723
Maybe you do play your hand
too close to the vest,

38:24.725 --> 38:27.926
especially when you have
no idea what you're holding.

38:31.297 --> 38:34.165
I enjoyed the poker

38:34.167 --> 38:37.669
and the vodka.

38:37.671 --> 38:40.405
Sorry it wasn't more
than that after all.

38:42.742 --> 38:46.444
Good-bye, Hank.

39:07.704 --> 39:12.056
Hey. I got your text. Who's the patient?

39:12.181 --> 39:14.148
What are they unhappy about?
There's no patient.

39:14.150 --> 39:17.218
The address I texted you
was my own.

39:20.455 --> 39:23.190
So... You live here?

39:23.192 --> 39:25.726
Evan, I'm very wealthy.

39:25.728 --> 39:29.797
Mazelhtov, man.

39:29.799 --> 39:34.869
In my last job,
I had a mentor who was...

39:34.871 --> 39:38.839
whom I found difficult to know.

39:38.841 --> 39:41.108
And he died.

39:41.110 --> 39:43.911
And when he did,
he left me the royalties

39:43.913 --> 39:46.480
from his medical patents...

39:46.482 --> 39:47.882
And his house.

39:49.352 --> 39:52.486
And one other thing.

40:16.811 --> 40:18.245
This is why I didn't think
the raffle was

40:18.247 --> 40:19.747
a logical investment.

40:19.749 --> 40:24.051
If Hankmed needs a Ferrari,
they can use mine.

40:24.053 --> 40:25.586
When would you like it?

40:31.526 --> 40:34.194
Yeaaaah!

40:39.200 --> 40:44.071
Oh, yeah. Evelyn Larson,
eat your heart out!

40:44.073 --> 40:47.408
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Whoo!

40:54.417 --> 40:55.916
It's all right,
it's all right...

41:07.228 --> 41:09.296
I presume
Christina has spoken with you.

41:09.298 --> 41:10.764
She did.

41:10.766 --> 41:12.900
Do not blame yourself, Hank.

41:12.902 --> 41:14.868
You did the right thing.

41:14.870 --> 41:17.204
And what did I do, exactly?

41:17.206 --> 41:19.039
You made me aware
of Christina's

41:19.041 --> 41:21.108
conflict of interest,
which, as you know,

41:21.110 --> 41:22.576
I cannot afford to risk
these days.

41:22.578 --> 41:25.546
So I severed my working
relationship with her.

41:25.548 --> 41:27.748
Purely a business decision.

41:27.750 --> 41:30.918
Boris, you're usually
a much better liar.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.653
I beg your pardon.

41:32.655 --> 41:34.955
I've seen the way
you do business,

41:34.957 --> 41:37.558
the way you play the game.
Hank...

41:37.560 --> 41:39.493
If you wanted,
you would have somehow used

41:39.495 --> 41:41.795
her conflict of interest
to your advantage.

41:41.797 --> 41:43.230
- Careful, Hank.
- This was personal.

41:43.232 --> 41:45.099
You've never gotten over
Christina.

41:45.101 --> 41:46.867
You set me up with her
to prove to yourself

41:46.869 --> 41:50.137
and to her...
That is enough!

41:55.010 --> 41:57.044
I think we are done here, Hank.

41:57.046 --> 41:59.213
I couldn't agree more.

42:00.782 --> 42:03.584
If you don't feel well,
call me.

42:03.586 --> 42:06.453
Other than that...

42:06.455 --> 42:08.222
I'm out.

42:44.692 --> 42:45.959
<i>This isn't gonna work.</i>
