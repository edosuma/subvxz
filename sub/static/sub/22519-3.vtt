01:04.857 --> 01:11.572
There's nobody there,
there's nobody there!

01:11.655 --> 01:15.951
Help me, help me,
help me, help me!

01:16.076 --> 01:17.452
There's nobody there!

01:17.578 --> 01:18.912
There's nobody there!

01:18.996 --> 01:20.789
There's nobody there!

01:24.459 --> 01:29.423
Help me, help me,
help me, help, help!

01:29.506 --> 01:35.220
Treachery, ruined, ruined,
[inaudible] England!

02:19.014 --> 02:23.101
Holmes, Holmes?

02:23.185 --> 02:26.813
Holmes?

02:28.065 --> 02:32.694
Holmes, Holmes?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.822
You come as a crisis,
Watson!

02:45.707 --> 02:48.001
Help yourself to tobacco
from the Persian slipper.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.796
I shall be at your service
in an instant.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.983
If this remains blue,
all is well.

03:11.066 --> 03:15.696
If it turns red,
it's a man's life.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.868
I thought as much.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.953
Mrs. Hudson!

03:24.079 --> 03:26.582
Mrs. Hudson!

03:31.086 --> 03:32.379
Would you find Billy,
please,

03:32.462 --> 03:35.591
and tell him to dispatch
these telegrams without delay.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.508
Thank you.

03:36.592 --> 03:40.345
Oh, Sit down, Watson.

03:44.099 --> 03:48.854
A commonplace
little murder!

03:48.937 --> 03:52.608
You have something
more interesting, I fancy.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.943
You are the stormy petrel
of crime, Watson.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.112
What is it?

03:57.237 --> 04:00.157
I've had a letter from a boy
I was at school with.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.535
I think you
should read it.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.954
Percy Phelps,
brilliant boy,

04:06.079 --> 04:07.956
carried off every prize
the school had to offer,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.375
went on to fresh
triumphs at Cambridge.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.168
I must confess,

04:11.293 --> 04:15.297
he'd passed completely
out of my mind until this.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.464
"My Dear Watson:

04:16.589 --> 04:19.091
I have no doubt you remember
Tadpole Phelps,

04:19.218 --> 04:22.304
who was in the third form
when you were in the fifth.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.014
It's possible
you may have heard

04:24.139 --> 04:25.933
that through
my uncle's influence

04:26.016 --> 04:28.894
I obtained a good appointment
at the Foreign Office."

04:28.977 --> 04:31.647
His uncle's Lord Holdhurst.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.899
"And that I was in a position
of trust and honor

04:33.982 --> 04:38.111
till a horrible misfortune came
suddenly to blast my career."

04:38.237 --> 04:41.740
Yes, his gaudy connections
did him little good at school.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.200
It seemed to us
a piquant thing

04:43.325 --> 04:45.911
to chevy him about
the playground,

04:45.994 --> 04:50.457
hit him over
the shins with a wicket.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.167
"Do you think you could bring
your friend Mr. Holmes

04:52.292 --> 04:54.795
down to see me?"

04:54.920 --> 04:56.338
That doesn't tell us much.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.548
Hardly anything.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.717
But the writing is of interest,
it is a woman's.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.261
No, no,
a man's, surely.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.847
No, a woman's.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.851
At the commencement of a case
it is always something to know

05:08.976 --> 05:12.271
that a client is in
close contact with someone who,

05:12.354 --> 05:17.818
for good or evil,
has an exceptional nature.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.153
You're interested?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.324
Indeed.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.158
Well, if you are ready,

05:25.242 --> 05:29.121
let us start for
Briarbrae House Woking, at once.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.414
Well, my practice--

05:30.539 --> 05:32.207
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

05:32.332 --> 05:34.376
Well, I mean, if your cases
are more interesting than mine.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.169
I was gonna say,

05:35.252 --> 05:38.213
my practice would do very well
for a day or two.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.340
It's the slackest time
of the year.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.177
Excellent.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.304
Then let us visit
this diplomatist

05:45.387 --> 05:47.347
who is in such evil case,

05:47.431 --> 05:51.560
and the lady to whom
he dictates his letters.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.063
Mrs. Hudson, hot water!

06:07.075 --> 06:08.160
Ah, Rose.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.330
Check this for me, would you?
That's a good love.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.877
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.921
And this is my colleague
and friend, Dr. Watson.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.964
Dr. Watson,
I'm so glad you've come.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.927
Percy's been inquiring after you
all morning, poor chap.

06:25.010 --> 06:31.058
I perceive that you, yourself,
are not a member of the family?

06:32.643 --> 06:36.230
Of course,
you see my JH monogram.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.899
Now, for a moment I thought
you'd done something clever.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.859
Joseph Harrison
is my name,

06:40.943 --> 06:43.278
and since Percy is betrothed
to my sister Annie,

06:43.362 --> 06:46.031
I shall at least be
a relation by marriage.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.242
You'll find her
in his room,

06:48.325 --> 06:52.371
she's been nursing him
these past two months.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.581
Rose, in the house.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.970
Now, listen,
they're here.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.263
Shall I leave?

07:09.388 --> 07:11.598
No, no.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.823
My dear Watson,
I should never have known you

07:27.906 --> 07:28.699
under that mustache,

07:28.824 --> 07:31.201
and I daresay you wouldn't
be prepared to swear to me.

07:31.326 --> 07:35.539
Not at all,
still the same dear old Tadpole.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.959
And this, I presume,
is your celebrated friend?

07:39.042 --> 07:43.172
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
Mr. Percy Phelps.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.090
And I'm Miss Harrison.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.342
My fiancé, and my nurse.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
Please, sit down.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.853
I, uh, I showed Holmes
the letter that you wrote to me.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.229
Yes, I hoped you would.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.440
It was rather short on detail.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.859
Then let me
get straight to the point.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.986
I work as a clerk
in the Foreign Office.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.614
My uncle
is Lord Holdhurst.

08:08.697 --> 08:12.326
When he became Foreign Minister,
he gave me,

08:12.409 --> 08:14.161
ocassional delicate
missions of trust,

08:14.286 --> 08:17.039
which I always managed
to conduct successfully.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.666
I'm sure you did, old chap.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.753
Pray, continue, Mr. Phelps.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.213
Nearly ten weeks ago,

08:24.296 --> 08:26.381
it was the evening
of the 23rd of May,

08:26.507 --> 08:28.634
he called me
into his private room.

08:38.602 --> 08:42.188
Ah, Percy, my dear boy!

08:42.313 --> 08:43.941
Good evening, sir.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.944
You've heard
of the Naval Treaty

08:47.069 --> 08:51.114
that has just been drawn up
between England and ltaly?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.824
I've read rumors
in the press, sir.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.910
Most regrettable,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.912
and it is of
the utmost importance

08:57.037 --> 08:58.747
that nothing further
should leak out.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.999
The French
and Russian embassies

09:01.083 --> 09:05.379
would pay an immense sum
to learn its contents.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.840
This is the original.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.800
It should
not leave my bureau

09:09.925 --> 09:13.011
were it not absolutely necessary
to have it copied.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.097
Take it straight to your office
and lock it up.

09:15.180 --> 09:19.726
Now, remain behind
when the others go,

09:19.810 --> 09:21.061
so that you can work
at your leisure

09:21.144 --> 09:24.231
and without fear
of being overlooked.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.024
And when you have finished,

09:26.108 --> 09:30.654
relock both the original
and the draft in your own desk,

09:30.779 --> 09:35.117
and hand them over to me
personally tomorrow morning.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.788
The very greatest care,
Nephew.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.623
You may rely on it, sir.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.958
This treaty,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.961
can you be more precise
as to its nature?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.589
Well, in outline it defined
the position of Great Britain

09:48.672 --> 09:50.007
towards the Triple Alliance

09:50.132 --> 09:51.300
in the event
of the French fleet

09:51.425 --> 09:56.013
gaining complete ascendancy
over ltaly in the Mediterranean.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.472
I returned straight
to my office

09:57.598 --> 09:59.224
where I found
a colleague of mine,

09:59.308 --> 10:02.644
Mr. Charles Gorot,
still working.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.856
Well, chap,

10:05.981 --> 10:09.193
what did Uncle want?

10:09.318 --> 10:13.155
To congratulate me
on my engagement.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.698
Splendid.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.638
Nothing else?

10:37.721 --> 10:41.308
Some fishing dispute
he wanted me to copy.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.697
You're not still on that
Bulgarian piece, are you?

10:55.822 --> 10:59.159
It's extremely long-winded
and tiresome,

10:59.243 --> 11:02.621
and I am fagged out
for the night.

11:02.704 --> 11:06.041
You working late again?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.835
Just a few things.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.045
You want to slack off a bit,
old man.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.589
Ambition is a fine thing
and all that,

11:12.714 --> 11:16.134
but do not neglect
the beautiful Miss Harrison.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.555
Some other chap
might step in.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.973
She wouldn't have you, Charles.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.391
Well, not me, old man.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.644
I've got my Daphne.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.187
Goodnight to you.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.273
Goodnight.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.954
You made sure that he was gone
before you started work?

11:44.079 --> 11:46.456
Quite sure,
and I copied as fast as I could,

11:46.582 --> 11:49.501
for I knew that Joseph,
my fiancé's brother--

11:49.585 --> 11:52.004
We met him in the garden.

11:52.087 --> 11:52.796
He was in town,

11:52.921 --> 11:55.841
and was traveling back to Woking
by the 11:00 o'clock train.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.093
And I wanted to catch it,
if possible.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.721
But it was a long document?

12:00.846 --> 12:03.390
Written in French.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.565
By 9:00 o'clock,
I was feeling drowsy

12:11.648 --> 12:14.484
and scarcely a third
of the way through.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.820
I thought a cup of coffee
might clear my brain,

12:16.945 --> 12:19.907
so I rang the commissioner
who stays on duty all night

12:20.032 --> 12:23.744
in a small lodge
at the bottom of the stairs.

12:30.918 --> 12:36.590
To my surprise, it was a woman
who answered the summons.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.385
I'm sorry, I was ringing
for Mr. Tangey.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.595
I'm his wife, sir,

12:41.720 --> 12:44.431
I do the char work
in this building.

12:44.515 --> 12:51.313
Ah, well, I was wondering if you
might bring me a cup of coffee.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.482
I'll go and ask him, sir.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.610
This woman,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.071
you've never noticed her
in the building before?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.031
Never.

13:01.156 --> 13:09.289
The coffee was some time coming,
so I went down to investigate.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.209
Leaving the room unguarded?

13:13.502 --> 13:15.504
Yes.

13:18.507 --> 13:23.887
I found Tangey--asleep.

13:37.192 --> 13:42.447
Mr. Phelps, sir,
I'm very sorry, sir.

13:42.531 --> 13:46.118
I must have just
dropped off for a moment.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.077
Your coffee, sir.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.960
Well, if you're here, sir,
who's ringing the bell?

13:55.043 --> 13:56.962
Bell, what bell is it?

13:57.045 --> 13:58.881
It's the bell in the room
in which you're working, sir.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.971
You ran back upstairs

14:06.054 --> 14:09.641
and the document was gone
from your desk.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.311
Yes!

14:12.394 --> 14:15.397
God no--

14:19.067 --> 14:21.653
You passed
no one in the corridor?

14:21.737 --> 14:24.239
No one,
there was no one!

14:24.364 --> 14:27.034
And the room
and the corridor

14:27.159 --> 14:29.828
all seemed exactly
as I'd left it!

14:29.912 --> 14:32.039
Percy has drawn a rough chart
of the building, Mr. Holmes,

14:32.164 --> 14:33.540
which he thought
might be of use.

14:33.624 --> 14:38.086
Yes, yes, that's of the utmost
importance, Mr. Holmes.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.633
Yes, I think
I quite follow it.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.719
On your discovery of the theft,
what did you do then?

14:45.802 --> 14:47.054
Well, I recognized
in an instant

14:47.137 --> 14:50.432
the thief must have come up
through the side door.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.142
This one here.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.602
Yes, of course.
Well, you'd have met him

14:53.685 --> 14:55.646
if he'd come the other way.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.023
And you are satisfied that they
could not have been concealed

14:58.106 --> 14:59.900
in the room
or in the corridor?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.735
Absolutely impossible.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.403
All the other doors
were locked.

15:03.487 --> 15:07.241
Strict
Foreign Office regulations.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.284
There was no cover at all.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.121
A rat couldn't have
concealed himself there.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.918
Tangey and I both rushed out

15:18.001 --> 15:19.878
down the stairs that lead
into Charles Street.

15:19.962 --> 15:20.629
Mr. Phelps!

15:20.754 --> 15:24.341
The door at
the bottom was closed, unlocked.

15:24.466 --> 15:28.804
It was dark, raining.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.558
There was no one!

15:32.641 --> 15:38.021
But I distinctly remember
the three-quarters of Big Ben.

15:38.146 --> 15:42.568
A quarter to ten.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.612
That is of
enormous importance.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.449
They came out here,
you see, Holmes.

15:49.533 --> 15:50.868
On the corner
we found a policeman,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.327
but he'd seen no one
leave the building

15:52.411 --> 15:53.287
in the last
quarter of an hour

15:53.370 --> 15:54.955
except for
the Commissioner's wife,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.833
so we ran
through to Whitehall.

15:57.958 --> 16:03.380
It was full of traffic,
people coming and going,

16:03.505 --> 16:05.507
all only too eager
to find a place of shelter

16:05.632 --> 16:08.177
on so wet a night.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.637
No lounger to tell you
who'd passed?

16:10.721 --> 16:11.972
None.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.725
Had it been raining
all evening?

16:14.850 --> 16:16.351
Since about 7:00.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.353
Ah, this chain of events

16:18.437 --> 16:22.107
is certainly of
extraordinary interest.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.860
And so you returned
to the office,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.528
examined it, I presume,

16:26.653 --> 16:29.615
to see if the intruder
had left any traces;

16:29.698 --> 16:34.578
muddy foot marks, any cigar end,
or dropped glove, hairpin?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.872
There was nothing.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.665
Except the tangible fact

16:38.790 --> 16:41.001
that the Commissioner's wife
had run out of the building

16:41.126 --> 16:44.796
not ten minutes earlier.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.633
What did you do next,
Mr. Phelps?

16:47.716 --> 16:53.180
The constable
alerted Scotland Yard.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.974
It was then
for the first time

16:56.058 --> 17:00.437
the full horror of
my situation came upon me.

17:00.562 --> 17:04.066
I'd been so confident
of regaining the treaty,

17:04.191 --> 17:07.944
I dared not think--

17:08.069 --> 17:08.904
Watson will tell you

17:09.029 --> 17:12.699
I was a nervous,
sensitive boy at school.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.743
It's my nature.

17:15.868 --> 17:21.500
I thought of my uncle,
his cabinet colleagues,

17:21.583 --> 17:28.674
the shame I'd brought
upon them, myself,

17:28.757 --> 17:32.302
everyone connected with me.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.764
Although I was the victim
of an accident,

17:35.848 --> 17:41.270
there are no allowance for
accidents in diplomatic circles.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.856
Ruined,

17:43.939 --> 17:49.278
shamefully,
hopelessly ruined!

17:49.403 --> 17:51.989
Steady on, old chap.

17:58.036 --> 18:01.957
Stand back,
will you, Holmes.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.272
Is the investigation concluded?

18:25.397 --> 18:30.485
Adjourned.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.906
Poor old Percy,
terrible strain, all this,

18:33.989 --> 18:36.575
career in the balance.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.660
It seems not to have affected
your sister's devotion.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.621
How long has she known
Mr. Phelps?

18:40.704 --> 18:43.415
Well, they met
in Northumberland in the winter.

18:43.499 --> 18:45.292
Percy was traveling
on government business

18:45.375 --> 18:46.835
in that part
of the world.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.170
It was love
at first sight.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
Do your people approve
of the match?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.799
Indeed, Mr. Holmes,

18:52.883 --> 18:55.135
especially when they learned
of Percy's connection

18:55.219 --> 18:56.678
with Lord Holdhurst.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.680
My father is an iron-master,

18:58.764 --> 19:01.600
and a staunch supporter
of the Conservative Party.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.352
She came down here
to meet Percy's people,

19:03.477 --> 19:04.436
and you came as escort?

19:04.520 --> 19:05.187
That's right,

19:05.312 --> 19:07.564
just before they left
for America.

19:07.689 --> 19:11.693
The, um, the wedding
is planned for September,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.028
if the poor chap recovers.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.030
I suppose you only intended
a short visit,

19:15.155 --> 19:16.323
and then came the smash?

19:16.448 --> 19:18.659
Mm.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.665
May I ask you
what your occupation is

19:24.790 --> 19:28.335
that allows you to while away
the summer in Woking?

19:28.418 --> 19:30.045
As the eldest son,
Mr. Holmes,

19:30.170 --> 19:33.507
I have expectations of
inheriting my father's business.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.009
I also dabble in
stocks and shares,

19:36.093 --> 19:39.513
which grants me
a certain independence.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.016
My apologies if
my question offended you.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.686
On the night
of May the 23rd,

19:45.811 --> 19:49.147
had you arranged to
meet Mr. Phelps at Waterloo

19:49.231 --> 19:50.899
to take the 11:00 o'clock
train together?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.526
No.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.069
That may have been
his intention,

19:54.194 --> 19:56.780
he knew I was in London
dining with my stockbroker.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.950
But I wasn't expecting
to meet him.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.286
Then thank you for your time,
Mr. Harrison.

20:02.411 --> 20:08.876
Shall I, um,
and would you, the sick room.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.509
Mr. Holmes,
I do apologize.

20:17.593 --> 20:22.806
I feel calmer now, thanks to
Watson's ministration.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.308
Gently with him, Holmes.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.560
Ah.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.729
Mr. Phelps,

20:28.812 --> 20:31.773
there is just the matter
of the Commissioner's wife.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.400
Yes, of course.

20:33.483 --> 20:37.321
As I remember, shortly after
our return to my office,

20:37.446 --> 20:38.655
Inspector Forbes
of the Yard

20:38.780 --> 20:42.618
arrived to take up the case
with considerable energy.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.912
We hired a hansom,
and within half an hour

20:45.037 --> 20:47.331
we were at the Tangeys' home
in Brixton.

20:47.456 --> 20:51.418
The door was opened
by his eldest daughter.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.461
Hey, what do you want?

20:52.544 --> 20:53.587
Is your mother at home?

20:53.712 --> 20:54.796
Not yet.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.798
She does a night job--
cleaning.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.842
We'll wait for her,
if you don't mind.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.845
In here.

21:01.970 --> 21:05.933
And you get back in here,
now go on, and shut the door.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.648
After about ten minutes,
we heard the front door,

21:12.731 --> 21:14.775
and here we made
one serious mistake

21:14.900 --> 21:18.403
for which I blame myself.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.783
Mum, there's two men in
the parlor wants to talk to ya'.

21:22.866 --> 21:25.452
Oh, my God!

21:33.710 --> 21:35.379
If it isn't Mr. Phelps
of the office.

21:35.504 --> 21:36.547
Come, come,
who did you think we were

21:36.672 --> 21:37.714
when you ran away from us?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.466
I thought you was the bailiffs.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.510
We've had some trouble
with a tradesman.

21:41.593 --> 21:47.391
Here, let go,
let go, let--

21:47.516 --> 21:48.058
We've reason to believe

21:48.183 --> 21:49.726
that you've taken a paper
of importance

21:49.852 --> 21:51.353
from the Foreign Office,

21:51.478 --> 21:53.689
and you ran in here
to dispose of it.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.274
Now, you better come back
with us to Scotland Yard

21:55.357 --> 21:55.983
to be searched.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.192
Get your hands off me!

21:57.317 --> 22:00.070
I didn't take no paper!
That will be enough--

22:00.195 --> 22:01.989
There will be peace and quiet.

22:02.114 --> 22:07.786
Mr. Phelps...no, stop it!

22:25.554 --> 22:28.390
You made a full examination
of the kitchen?

22:28.473 --> 22:29.975
Yes.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.228
There was no sign
of the documents.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.064
A four-wheeler was brought

22:36.148 --> 22:39.860
and we all three drove back
in it to Scotland Yard.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.571
I waited in
an agony of suspense

22:42.696 --> 22:45.574
until the female searcher
came back with her report.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.201
They found nothing.

22:47.326 --> 22:50.621
After that,
I have no clear recollection.

22:50.746 --> 22:54.249
I believe a police officer
drove me to Waterloo

22:54.374 --> 22:56.251
where by the merest
good fortune,

22:56.335 --> 22:58.587
I met Dr. Ferrier,
who lives near us

22:58.712 --> 23:01.465
and was traveling
down by the next train.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.509
The train you caught now
would have been?

23:03.592 --> 23:06.762
The 11:40, I think.

23:06.887 --> 23:10.390
Dr. Ferrier most kindly
took charge of me.

23:10.474 --> 23:13.435
Just as well he did,
for I had a fit in the station

23:13.519 --> 23:18.357
and before we reached home I was
practically a raving lunatic.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.567
Your brother
had already returned?

23:20.651 --> 23:22.027
Yes.

23:22.110 --> 23:26.073
I was surprised, but not unduly
worried that he was alone.

23:26.156 --> 23:29.952
Percy often worked late, and
I knew there was another train.

23:30.077 --> 23:32.579
So I went to bed.

23:32.663 --> 23:35.582
And sometime after midnight?

23:35.666 --> 23:39.461
I was woken by the most
fearful commotion in the hall.

23:39.586 --> 23:43.632
Bring him in here,
bring him in here!

23:43.757 --> 23:46.426
Oh, God...

23:48.053 --> 23:50.848
Your brother was sleeping
down here in this room?

23:50.973 --> 23:51.682
Yes.

23:51.807 --> 23:54.309
My family were taking advantage
of their trip to America

23:54.434 --> 23:56.812
to have several of the upstairs
bedrooms redecorated.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.815
It was evident that poor Percy
was in for a long illness.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.276
So, Joseph
was bundled up to my room,

24:02.359 --> 24:08.740
and this was turned
into a sick room for me.

24:15.539 --> 24:20.294
Why, it's a very cheery room.

24:20.419 --> 24:23.672
I have lain here
for nine weeks, delirious.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.550
If it had not been for Miss
Harrison and the doctor's care,

24:26.675 --> 24:29.761
I should not
be speaking to you now.

24:29.845 --> 24:32.055
She nursed me by day,

24:32.181 --> 24:35.601
a hired nurse
looked after me at night,

24:35.726 --> 24:39.479
for in the mad fits
I was capable of anything.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.647
It's only in
the last few days

24:40.772 --> 24:45.652
that my reason
has slowly cleared.

24:45.736 --> 24:47.863
I've wired Inspector Forbes,

24:47.988 --> 24:51.366
but he's told me
no clue has been discovered.

24:51.450 --> 24:56.914
So I turn to you, Mr. Holmes,
as my last hope.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.877
Just one question of the utmost
importance, Mr. Phelps.

25:02.002 --> 25:05.923
Did you tell anyone that you had
this special task to perform?

25:06.048 --> 25:07.007
No one.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.551
Not Miss Harrison,
for example?

25:09.635 --> 25:11.261
No.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.305
I had not been
back to Woking

25:13.388 --> 25:19.019
in between getting the order
and executing the commission.

25:22.773 --> 25:27.611
What a lovely thing a rose is.

25:27.736 --> 25:32.741
There is nothing in which
deduction is so necessary

25:32.866 --> 25:35.369
as in religion.

25:35.494 --> 25:39.748
It can be built up as an exact
science by the reasoner.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.709
Our highest assurance of
the goodness of Providence

25:42.793 --> 25:45.754
seems to me
to rest in the flowers.

25:45.879 --> 25:49.299
It is only goodness
which gives extras,

25:49.424 --> 25:51.969
and so I say again,

25:52.094 --> 25:58.559
we have much to hope for
from the flowers.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.814
Do you see any prospect

26:03.939 --> 26:10.612
of solving this mystery,
Mr. Holmes?

26:10.737 --> 26:12.614
Mystery?

26:12.698 --> 26:17.244
Ah, it would be
absurd to deny

26:17.369 --> 26:19.913
that the case is
abstruse and complicated.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.582
Do you see any clue?

26:21.665 --> 26:22.749
You have furnished me
with seven,

26:22.833 --> 26:24.376
but I must put them
to the test

26:24.459 --> 26:27.087
before I can pronounce
on their value.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.672
You suspect someone?

26:28.797 --> 26:32.301
I suspect...

26:32.426 --> 26:33.510
myself.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.761
What?

26:34.845 --> 26:38.348
Of coming to conclusions
too rapidly.

26:38.473 --> 26:44.813
Then go back to London
and test your conclusions!

26:44.938 --> 26:50.777
Your advice is very excellent,
Miss Harrison.

26:54.406 --> 26:58.619
Mr. Phelps, do not indulge
yourself in false hopes,

26:58.744 --> 27:01.163
the affair is
a very tangled one,

27:01.246 --> 27:05.459
and I am not a magician.

27:08.962 --> 27:13.634
Hey, little varmint!

27:13.759 --> 27:16.011
What do you think
of Miss Harrison?

27:16.136 --> 27:19.014
A good sort,
or I'm mistaken.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.974
I thought you were
rather terse with her.

27:21.058 --> 27:22.476
Was I?

27:22.559 --> 27:24.311
She was only
protecting her loved one.

27:24.436 --> 27:27.272
A little
overprotective, perhaps.

27:27.356 --> 27:28.148
Surely, you don't believe

27:28.232 --> 27:31.485
that she had anything
to do with it?

27:31.568 --> 27:34.363
The most difficult crime
to track down, Watson,

27:34.488 --> 27:35.697
is the one which
is purposeless.

27:35.823 --> 27:38.242
Now, this is
not purposeless,

27:38.367 --> 27:40.994
but who is it
that profits by it?

27:41.119 --> 27:43.997
Well, there's the French
Ambassador, the Russian,

27:44.081 --> 27:46.041
and whoever might sell it
to either of those.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.877
And Lord Holdhurst.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.295
While it is not inconceivable

27:50.379 --> 27:52.548
that a statesman might
find himself in a position

27:52.673 --> 27:54.091
where he was not sorry

27:54.216 --> 27:57.177
to see such a document
accidentally destroyed.

27:57.261 --> 27:58.095
Not a statesman

27:58.220 --> 28:01.306
with the honorable record
of Lord Holdhurst.

28:01.390 --> 28:06.728
George, the Foreign Office,

28:06.854 --> 28:10.065
Charles Street entrance.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.192
George, I want you
to do something for me.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.486
Find the cab
which dropped a fare there

28:14.570 --> 28:19.408
just after half past 9:00
on the evening of May the 23rd.

28:23.745 --> 28:27.666
Gorot, a French name.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.418
Huguenot, actually.

28:29.543 --> 28:33.046
But I'm as English in sympathy
as you are, Mr. Holmes.

28:33.172 --> 28:36.842
Am I under some sort of cloud
because of my name?

28:36.925 --> 28:39.887
Oh, no, no,
Holmes has a French grandmother.

28:44.558 --> 28:47.519
I'd make yourself scarce if you
want to avoid Inspector Forbes.

28:47.603 --> 28:50.063
We've arranged to meet him here
in five minutes.

28:50.147 --> 28:56.195
Yes, I have
been questioned by him already.

28:56.278 --> 28:59.990
I shall do as you say.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.200
Goodnight to you both.

29:01.283 --> 29:01.909
Goodnight.

29:01.992 --> 29:03.952
Goodnight.

29:04.077 --> 29:05.454
No secret doors,

29:05.537 --> 29:07.998
the windows quite
30 feet above the ground,

29:08.123 --> 29:10.959
fastened on
the inner side.

29:16.465 --> 29:21.470
The carpet prevents any
possibility of a trap door.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.388
Now, whoever rang
the bell rope

29:23.472 --> 29:27.392
must have come
right over to the desk.

29:27.476 --> 29:31.772
Why ring it?

29:31.897 --> 29:36.068
I mean, was it the thief,
out of bravado?

29:36.151 --> 29:41.073
Or was it someone with the thief
who tried to prevent the crime?

29:45.494 --> 29:48.455
Or was it--

29:54.002 --> 29:56.922
Inspector Forbes,
I believe.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.634
Mr. Holmes,
I'm a very busy man.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.970
I have other cases
besides this one.

30:03.053 --> 30:07.850
But none so vital to the
national interest, I'll wager.

30:07.975 --> 30:11.770
May I introduce my friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson?

30:15.023 --> 30:17.317
What do you
want from me, Holmes?

30:17.442 --> 30:19.528
I know about your methods.

30:19.653 --> 30:21.822
You're ready enough
to use our information,

30:21.905 --> 30:23.657
then you try and finish
the case yourself

30:23.782 --> 30:25.492
and bring discredit on us.

30:25.576 --> 30:28.662
On the contrary,
in my last 53 cases,

30:28.787 --> 30:31.039
my name has
appeared in only 4

30:31.165 --> 30:37.838
and the police have
the credit in 49.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.882
I don't blame you
for not knowing this,

30:40.007 --> 30:43.385
you are young
and inexperienced.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.512
But if you wish
to get on in your duties

30:45.596 --> 30:48.098
you will work with me
and not against me!

30:48.223 --> 30:51.435
Now, then, what steps
have you taken?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.313
Tangey, the commissioner,
we've cleared.

30:54.396 --> 30:57.065
He left the Guards
with a good character.

30:57.191 --> 31:00.611
His wife is a bad lot,
though, she drinks.

31:00.736 --> 31:04.198
What about the clerk, Gorot?

31:04.323 --> 31:06.450
He's been shadowed
all these nine weeks.

31:06.575 --> 31:08.327
We can show
nothing against him.

31:08.410 --> 31:12.581
Have you formed any theory
about how this bell rang?

31:12.706 --> 31:13.624
No.

31:13.749 --> 31:16.043
I must confess,
that beats me.

31:16.126 --> 31:18.086
It was a cool hand,
whoever it was,

31:18.212 --> 31:19.421
to go and give
the alarm like that.

31:19.546 --> 31:22.299
Yes, yes, it was
a very queer thing to do.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.592
Well, many thanks,
Inspector,

31:23.717 --> 31:25.552
and if I can put this thief
in your hands,

31:25.636 --> 31:26.887
you shall hear from me.

31:27.012 --> 31:30.015
Come along, Watson.

31:30.098 --> 31:34.186
May I ask where
you're going now?

31:34.269 --> 31:38.649
To interview Lord Holdhurst,
the Cabinet Minister

31:38.774 --> 31:42.194
and very possibly
the next Premier of England.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.280
Good evening, Inspector.

31:46.532 --> 31:47.616
I can't pretend, Mr. Holmes,

31:47.741 --> 31:50.994
that I am ignorant of
the reason for your visit,

31:51.119 --> 31:53.622
but in whose interests
are you acting, may I ask?

31:53.747 --> 31:55.582
In the part
of Mr. Percy Phelps.

31:55.666 --> 31:58.168
Ah, my unfortunate nephew.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.920
You can understand
that our kinship

32:00.045 --> 32:04.508
makes it the more impossible
for me to screen him in any way.

32:04.633 --> 32:08.512
Yes, but if the document
is found, Lord Holdhurst?

32:08.637 --> 32:14.768
That, of course,
would be different.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.355
Lord Holdhurst,
it was in this room

32:18.480 --> 32:23.402
that you gave instructions
for the copying of the document?

32:23.485 --> 32:26.071
It was.

32:26.155 --> 32:28.365
And you mentioned it to
nobody else except your nephew,

32:28.490 --> 32:30.117
you're certain of that?

32:30.242 --> 32:32.161
Absolutely.

32:32.244 --> 32:34.454
Then if nobody
else knew of it,

32:34.580 --> 32:39.168
you would agree that the thief's
presence in your nephew's room

32:39.293 --> 32:40.210
was purely accidental.

32:40.335 --> 32:43.630
I mean, he saw his chance
and took it.

32:45.174 --> 32:50.888
You take me out of my province
there, Mr. Holmes.

32:51.763 --> 32:56.935
There is one other
very important point.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.313
You feared,
so I understand,

32:59.396 --> 33:00.898
that very grave results

33:01.023 --> 33:06.278
might follow from the details
of this treaty becoming known?

33:06.361 --> 33:09.990
Very grave results indeed.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.618
Have they occurred?

33:12.701 --> 33:14.453
Not yet.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.580
If the treaty had reached,
let us say,

33:16.705 --> 33:19.416
the Russian
or the French Foreign Office,

33:19.541 --> 33:21.793
you would expect
to hear of it?

33:21.877 --> 33:23.795
I certainly should.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.882
Then since
nearly ten weeks have elapsed,

33:27.007 --> 33:29.301
it is not unfair
to suppose then

33:29.384 --> 33:35.516
that the treaty for some reason
has not reached them.

33:35.599 --> 33:36.767
But Holmes,
we can hardly suppose

33:36.892 --> 33:40.187
that the thief took the treaty
in order to...

33:40.312 --> 33:45.025
frame it and hang it
on his wall.

33:45.108 --> 33:51.824
Well, perhaps he's waiting
for a better price, Watson.

33:51.907 --> 33:56.161
Or maybe he's
had a sudden illness.

33:56.245 --> 34:02.209
A brain storm,
for example?

34:02.292 --> 34:05.546
I did not say so.

34:05.671 --> 34:10.717
Lord Holdhurst, we have taken up
too much of your valuable time.

34:13.594 --> 34:17.641
Fine fellow,
heavy responsibilities.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.893
Yes, but he has a struggle
to keep up his position,

34:19.976 --> 34:24.565
and he's far from rich.

34:24.690 --> 34:29.194
You noticed, of course,
that his boots had been resoled.

34:29.277 --> 34:32.197
Really?!

34:33.699 --> 34:34.741
I shall do nothing more today

34:34.824 --> 34:37.578
unless I get an answer
to my cab inquiry.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.788
Ah.

34:46.043 --> 34:49.089
All right.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.513
Oh, Watson, I won't
detain you any longer

34:56.638 --> 34:59.349
from your legitimate work.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.976
But I should be
extremely obliged

35:01.101 --> 35:03.270
if you would come down
to Woking with me tomorrow,

35:03.353 --> 35:05.981
the same train
that we took today.

35:06.106 --> 35:09.860
Yes, of course.

35:11.487 --> 35:14.114
Goodnight, Holmes.

35:19.161 --> 35:25.292
No, no, tonight I shall sleep
my own sleep, and alone.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.376
But Percy.

35:26.502 --> 35:28.504
Mr. Holmes has imbued me
with fresh hope,

35:28.629 --> 35:31.507
and I feel
I'm on the mend.

35:31.632 --> 35:36.136
We have an appointment in church
in September, my love,

35:36.220 --> 35:39.973
and I mean to keep it.

36:05.582 --> 36:07.835
He sent the nurse away.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.379
At last.

36:10.462 --> 36:13.423
He puts too much faith
in the great detective.

36:13.549 --> 36:14.716
It's you that's kept
his flame alive,

36:14.842 --> 36:16.218
not some detective.

36:16.343 --> 36:18.512
And you, brother.

36:18.595 --> 36:23.016
Without you
to support me--

37:33.921 --> 37:37.925
Could it be that I am the center
of some monstrous conspiracy,

37:38.050 --> 37:41.178
and that my life is aimed at,
as well as my honor?

37:41.303 --> 37:43.597
I haven't as far as I know,
an enemy in the world!

37:43.722 --> 37:47.017
You certainly have had your
share of misfortune, old chap.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.312
I think I may have
found the spot

37:50.437 --> 37:54.483
where the fella'
scaled the wall!

37:57.402 --> 37:59.404
It's towards the road.

37:59.488 --> 38:01.114
Ah, do you think
this was done last night?

38:01.198 --> 38:02.658
It looks rather old to me.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.618
No, I fancy we shall get
no help there.

38:04.701 --> 38:10.040
Now, why did the intruder choose
the window onto the courtyard?

38:10.165 --> 38:10.916
I should have thought

38:10.999 --> 38:13.752
this side of the house
would have been easier.

38:13.836 --> 38:15.170
It's more visible
from the courtyard.

38:15.295 --> 38:17.256
Ah, yes, of course.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.633
Have you ever had an alarm
like this before?

38:19.716 --> 38:22.427
There's no plate in the house,
or anything to attract burglars?

38:22.511 --> 38:27.391
Nothing of value.

38:28.475 --> 38:29.810
Was there anything
in London?

38:29.893 --> 38:32.479
Well, we've seen
Inspector Forbes,

38:32.604 --> 38:34.773
we've seen your uncle.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.984
Holmes has set one
or two things in motion.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.735
So you've not lost heart.

38:38.861 --> 38:41.822
Oh, by no means!

38:41.947 --> 38:43.282
God bless you
for saying that.

38:43.365 --> 38:46.410
If we keep
our courage and patience,

38:46.535 --> 38:48.996
the truth must come out.

38:52.374 --> 38:53.667
Miss Harrison,

38:53.792 --> 38:56.503
you must remain in this room
for the rest of the day.

38:56.628 --> 38:57.921
It is of vital importance.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.798
Now, tonight,
when you go to bed,

38:59.882 --> 39:02.968
lock that door from the outside
and keep the key.

39:03.051 --> 39:03.635
But Percy?

39:03.719 --> 39:04.261
Tell no one!

39:04.386 --> 39:06.513
Now, quick, promise!

39:08.765 --> 39:10.767
Why are you
moping in here, honey?

39:10.893 --> 39:12.102
Come out in the sunshine.

39:12.227 --> 39:14.396
I'll be your crockie.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.066
I have a slight headache

39:18.192 --> 39:20.736
and this room is deliciously
cool and soothing,

39:20.861 --> 39:22.404
thank you, Joseph.

39:22.529 --> 39:25.991
Mr. Phelps, while we're
investigating this minor affair

39:26.074 --> 39:30.829
we must not lose sight
of our main inquiry.

39:30.913 --> 39:32.706
It would help me very much

39:32.831 --> 39:34.500
if you would come up
to London with us.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.210
Do you feel strong enough?

39:36.293 --> 39:39.630
Yes, if you really think
I can be of help.

39:39.755 --> 39:42.674
Do you want me
to stay the night?

39:42.758 --> 39:44.593
I was on the point
of proposing it.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.678
Then if my friend of the night
comes to visit me,

39:46.762 --> 39:47.971
he'll find the bird flown.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.681
But, what about Annie?

39:49.765 --> 39:51.683
Ah, Mr. Harrison
will look after her,

39:51.767 --> 39:54.603
and my friend Watson will take
care of your medical needs.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.231
Could you be ready to leave
in an hour?

39:57.356 --> 40:00.901
We are all in your hands,
Mr. Holmes.

40:08.575 --> 40:10.369
There are one or two points
I wish to clear up,

40:10.452 --> 40:14.581
and your absence, Mr. Phelps,
will rather assist me.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.542
Watson,
when you reach London

40:16.625 --> 40:18.460
drive our friend
straight to Baker Street

40:18.585 --> 40:21.797
and remain with him
until I see you again.

40:21.922 --> 40:25.175
And now, gentlemen,
I shall leave you.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.970
What about our
investigation in London?!

40:28.095 --> 40:32.099
I hope to be in London
in time for breakfast.

40:33.100 --> 40:37.104
He really is the most
inscrutable fellow, Watson.

41:01.962 --> 41:04.631
Oh, you're still in here.

41:04.756 --> 41:06.175
How's your headache?

41:06.300 --> 41:09.761
A little better.

41:09.887 --> 41:14.224
The first day for nine weeks
without the invalid,

41:14.349 --> 41:17.644
and you choose
to spend it in here.

41:17.728 --> 41:20.564
Force of habit.

41:20.689 --> 41:22.608
Are you dining tonight?

41:22.691 --> 41:25.694
I'm not hungry,
and I'm enjoying my book.

41:25.819 --> 41:29.323
Mm, I understand.

41:29.448 --> 41:34.620
My poor little sister,
what a time you've had.

42:20.582 --> 42:23.126
That'll be Mr. Holmes
returning now, sir.

42:24.795 --> 42:27.756
Thank you, Horace.

42:36.139 --> 42:38.350
He looks like a beaten man.

42:38.433 --> 42:41.854
I confess you may be right.

42:45.858 --> 42:48.902
I'd hoped for so much!

43:01.957 --> 43:04.001
Holmes, you're wounded!

43:04.126 --> 43:06.253
Oh, it's only a scratch
through my own clumsiness.

43:06.336 --> 43:08.463
Good morning, Mr. Phelps,
this case of yours

43:08.589 --> 43:13.510
is certainly one of the darkest
I have ever investigated.

43:15.971 --> 43:17.890
It has been
a remarkable experience.

43:17.973 --> 43:20.934
Oh, come along, Holmes, that
bandage tells of adventures.

43:21.018 --> 43:22.603
Now, what happened?

43:22.686 --> 43:23.979
After breakfast,
my dear Watson.

43:24.104 --> 43:25.272
Remember,
I have breathed

43:25.355 --> 43:27.608
30 miles of Surrey air
this morning.

43:27.733 --> 43:30.944
There's been no answer
to my cab inquiry, I suppose?

43:31.028 --> 43:33.322
Well, one cannot score
every time.

43:33.447 --> 43:37.618
Mrs. Hudson, you have risen
to the occasion.

43:37.701 --> 43:39.286
Won't you join us,
Mr. Phelps?

43:39.411 --> 43:41.330
Now, what's in this?

43:41.413 --> 43:42.831
Curried chicken, sir.

43:42.915 --> 43:43.499
And this?

43:43.624 --> 43:45.459
Ham and eggs.

43:45.542 --> 43:47.252
Her cuisine
is a little limited,

43:47.336 --> 43:50.923
but she has as good an idea
of breakfast as any Scotswoman.

43:51.006 --> 43:53.842
Now, what will you take,
Mr. Phelps, curried fowl, eggs,

43:53.967 --> 43:55.219
or will you help yourself?

43:55.344 --> 43:56.637
Thank you.
I can eat nothing.

43:56.762 --> 43:58.764
Oh, please, try
the dish before you.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.974
Thank you, I would
really rather not.

44:01.099 --> 44:05.479
Oh, well, then, I suppose you
have no objection to helping me?

44:09.858 --> 44:12.486
Oh!

44:21.703 --> 44:23.497
It's the treaty.

44:25.916 --> 44:30.379
It's the treaty.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.047
It's the treaty.

44:32.172 --> 44:36.844
My God, it's the treaty!

44:36.927 --> 44:38.095
It's the treaty!

44:38.220 --> 44:44.518
It's the treaty!

44:44.601 --> 44:47.312
Watson, brandy.

44:48.438 --> 44:49.356
Ah, there, there, there,

44:49.439 --> 44:51.900
it really was too bad of me
to spring it on you like that,

44:52.025 --> 44:52.985
but Watson here
will tell you

44:53.068 --> 44:55.988
that I never can resist
a touch of the dramatic.

44:56.071 --> 45:00.367
God bless you
for saving my honor.

45:01.869 --> 45:03.162
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

45:03.245 --> 45:09.918
Oh, thank you for
your many considerations.

45:10.043 --> 45:15.883
A Scotswoman's breakfast,
indeed, a silly bit of paper!

45:15.966 --> 45:22.347
Please, tell me how you got it,
where it was!

45:22.431 --> 45:24.057
After I left you,

45:24.183 --> 45:26.351
I settled myself into
the English countryside

45:26.435 --> 45:29.730
and spent
a charming afternoon.

45:29.855 --> 45:33.567
I remained there until dusk,

45:33.650 --> 45:36.278
and then I returned
to your house.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.071
I clambered over the wall

45:38.155 --> 45:40.949
and made my way
through the undergrowth

45:41.074 --> 45:42.743
until I reached the stables,

45:42.868 --> 45:47.789
just opposite
your bedroom window.

45:47.873 --> 45:49.958
The blind in your window
had not yet been drawn,

45:50.083 --> 45:53.504
and I could see Miss Harrison
reading a book

45:53.629 --> 45:57.674
by the light from a lamp.

45:58.592 --> 46:01.929
It was about a quarter-past ten
when she closed the book,

46:02.012 --> 46:08.936
moved across the room,
carrying the lamp with her.

46:09.019 --> 46:13.065
But I felt quite sure that she
had turned the key in the lock.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.441
Key?

46:14.566 --> 46:16.193
The instructions I gave her,

46:16.318 --> 46:18.529
which she carried out
to the letter.

46:18.654 --> 46:22.282
Mr. Phelps, she is a lady
of rare character.

46:22.407 --> 46:23.492
Without her cooperation,

46:23.617 --> 46:26.954
you would not have that paper
in your hand now.

46:27.079 --> 46:29.665
It was a weary vigil,

46:29.790 --> 46:32.876
but it had the sort of
excitement a sportsman feels

46:33.001 --> 46:34.795
when he lies before
the watercourse

46:34.878 --> 46:39.258
and waits for the big game.

46:42.511 --> 46:44.805
What happened,
what happened?!

46:45.472 --> 46:47.808
It was about 2:00 o'clock
in the morning,

46:47.891 --> 46:53.313
when I heard the gentle sound
of a bolt being pushed back.

47:35.105 --> 47:36.231
All right.

47:36.356 --> 47:40.027
All right, Holmes,
what you gonna do with me?

47:41.987 --> 47:44.907
I've got what I want.

47:44.990 --> 47:48.368
Ow!--Run.

48:03.509 --> 48:06.553
Joseph!

48:06.637 --> 48:09.765
You let him go?!

48:09.890 --> 48:12.351
I wired full particulars
to Inspector Forbes.

48:12.434 --> 48:14.436
If he's quick enough to catch
his bird, well and good.

48:14.561 --> 48:17.105
But if, as I shrewdly suspect,
he finds the nest empty,

48:17.231 --> 48:20.609
why, all the better
for the government.

48:20.734 --> 48:22.402
I fancy Lord Holdhurst,
for one,

48:22.528 --> 48:25.823
and Mr. Percy Phelps
for another,

48:25.948 --> 48:30.160
would much rather the affair
never got to a police court.

48:30.285 --> 48:33.747
My God, do you tell me that
during my 10 long weeks of agony

48:33.872 --> 48:39.920
the stolen papers were in the
very room with me all the time?

48:40.045 --> 48:44.716
And Joseph,
a villain and a thief!

48:44.800 --> 48:48.262
From what I gather, he had lost
heavily dabbling in stocks,

48:48.387 --> 48:50.931
and concealed the fact
from his father,

48:51.056 --> 48:53.892
a man of strictly
conservative habits.

48:53.976 --> 48:57.312
Yes, but his own
sister's happiness,

48:57.437 --> 49:01.275
and your reputation,
your health!

49:01.358 --> 49:04.945
He knew that you
often worked late,

49:05.028 --> 49:07.447
and he was in town having dinner
with his stockbroker,

49:07.531 --> 49:09.116
as he told me.

49:09.199 --> 49:12.536
But he was free
by half past 9:00,

49:12.661 --> 49:16.748
and called by your office,
entering through the side door.

49:16.832 --> 49:19.001
Percy?

49:26.842 --> 49:28.552
Finding no one in there

49:28.677 --> 49:32.431
but the light on and work
evidently in progress,

49:32.514 --> 49:34.766
he rang the bell.

49:34.850 --> 49:38.979
The instant he did so, his eye
caught the paper on the table.

49:39.104 --> 49:41.815
He knew at once that chance
had put in his way

49:41.940 --> 49:46.653
a state document
of immense value,

49:57.956 --> 49:59.458
returned alone to Woking

49:59.583 --> 50:02.920
and concealed it in what he
thought was a very safe place,

50:03.045 --> 50:05.214
intending to remove it
in a day or two,

50:05.339 --> 50:06.924
and take it to
the French embassy

50:07.049 --> 50:10.052
or wherever he thought
a long price was to be had.

50:10.177 --> 50:12.387
There's nobody there,
there's nobody there!

50:15.557 --> 50:19.728
Then came your sudden return.

50:19.853 --> 50:23.315
Without a moment's warning
he was bundled out of his room

50:23.440 --> 50:24.525
and from that moment on,

50:24.650 --> 50:27.569
there were always at least
two of you in there,

50:27.694 --> 50:34.201
preventing him from regaining
his treasure, maddening for him.

50:34.326 --> 50:36.703
My suspicions
became certainties

50:36.829 --> 50:37.830
when the attempt to break in

50:37.913 --> 50:40.999
was made on the first night
that the hired nurse was absent,

50:41.083 --> 50:43.710
which showed
that the intruder

50:43.794 --> 50:47.256
was well accustomed
with the ways of the house.

50:47.381 --> 50:50.509
At last,
he had his chance.

50:50.592 --> 50:53.971
But you baffled him
with your wakefulness.

50:54.096 --> 50:57.850
Yes! I didn't take
my sleeping draft!

50:57.933 --> 51:00.561
But he had another chance
when you came up to London.

51:00.644 --> 51:07.025
I kept Miss Harrison in the room
all day so as to anticipate him.

51:07.109 --> 51:09.987
But if you already knew
the papers were in the room?

51:10.112 --> 51:11.864
I thought
they probably were,

51:11.947 --> 51:14.074
but I had no desire to rip up
all the skirting

51:14.158 --> 51:15.576
in search of them.

51:15.659 --> 51:17.494
By allowing him to lead me
to the hiding place,

51:17.619 --> 51:20.122
I saved myself
an infinity of trouble.

51:20.247 --> 51:23.292
And caught him red-handed!

51:23.417 --> 51:24.835
Quite so.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.628
Yes, but why did
he try the window

51:26.753 --> 51:28.547
when he might have come in
through the door?

51:28.630 --> 51:30.924
To appear to be a burglar,
and if necessary,

51:31.008 --> 51:34.511
make good his escape
across the courtyard.

51:34.636 --> 51:36.263
The knife,

51:36.388 --> 51:40.559
you don't think he had
any murderous intentions?

51:40.642 --> 51:41.435
My dear fellow,

51:41.518 --> 51:44.313
I can only say that Mr. Joseph
Harrison is a gentleman

51:44.438 --> 51:48.942
to whose mercy I should be
extremely unwilling to trust.

51:49.067 --> 51:52.488
That will be a young lady
for you, Mr. Phelps.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.366
Annie!

51:56.492 --> 52:00.162
I left her a note to come
to London the moment she woke.

52:00.287 --> 52:01.872
But Mr. Phelps,

52:01.997 --> 52:07.336
she knows nothing as yet
of her brother's criminality.

52:07.461 --> 52:10.422
Oh, yes.

52:10.506 --> 52:16.261
My dear Holmes,
I can't thank you enough.

52:18.680 --> 52:23.810
I shall go down at once
and explain everything.

52:25.312 --> 52:32.110
Percy, good-bye,
and good luck!

52:34.947 --> 52:38.492
Thank you for
restoring my happiness.

52:40.953 --> 52:44.665
There's a young lady
at the door, sir.

52:44.748 --> 52:49.086
Mr. Holmes, hot water!

52:51.380 --> 52:52.714
Thank you.
