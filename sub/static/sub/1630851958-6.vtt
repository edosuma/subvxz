00:06.131 --> 00:09.342
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:20.497 --> 01:22.332
Hope it turns out good.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.800
Add a little more paprika, cabrón.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.742
Don't forget to set a plate for Delfina.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.039
It's a tradition.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.336
I'm so glad
you bring up traditions because…

02:57.010 --> 02:58.219
What is that?

03:08.104 --> 03:11.107
You're going to put her
on the dining table with her boobs out?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.468
Come in!

03:43.264 --> 03:44.474
What's this, mija?

03:53.983 --> 03:57.570
- My love! These are for me?
-Yes.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.409
They are beautiful.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.499
I remember when your uncles
brought these shoes…

04:10.250 --> 04:12.168
home, I burned them.

04:13.503 --> 04:17.006
Because I didn't want them
to look like cholitos.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.260
Well, look, times change, old man.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.887
-They look cool, no?
-Yes.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.394
- I love you very much.
-Thank you, my love.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.085
No, no, no, mijita!
Sit. She thinks she's an adult.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.593
Pilgrim's blood.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.722
Listen up!
I want to say something.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.767
If you can give me your attention.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.895
-Chris.
-Please. Your attention, family!

05:58.232 --> 06:00.360
This year has been difficult.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.363
We've had a lot of changes.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.115
The truth is…

06:07.617 --> 06:10.995
we may never be
together again like we are today.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.581
-Stop.
-It's the truth, and it needs to be said.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.418
Yes, on this Thanksgiving,

06:18.419 --> 06:21.297
we have to be thankful
for all the good we have.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.635
Raise your blood of chingadera.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.556
And happy Thanksgiving
to the Morales family.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.725
Happy Thanksgiving to the Morales family.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.580
Please. All I want
is a happy Thanksgiving.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.141
Let's go!
I'm really hungry! Let's eat dinner!

08:39.101 --> 08:41.938
You with your five types
of potatoes. Go sit down.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.909
Come, mijo. Sit here.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.870
-Gracias.
-Did you say hello to your mother?

09:00.414 --> 09:03.292
Ernesto,
why isn't Luz with you?

09:03.376 --> 09:06.420
- Better not start without me.
-Does your wife hate you that much?

09:06.504 --> 09:09.632
She's on a ski vacation,
but thanks for asking.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.030
New traditions,
my love. Ándale.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.699
Come on, don't be rigid.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.426
But we're hungry!

10:23.748 --> 10:26.709
You the kind of
people who pay someone to listen to you?

10:28.502 --> 10:30.254
-How ridiculous!
-Amá!

10:30.838 --> 10:33.716
Why don't you pay me?
I can listen to you better.

10:48.022 --> 10:52.276
Women should take care
of their husbands. Lupe knows that, right?

10:52.360 --> 10:55.196
Young women today are too self-sufficient.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.661
But not by choice, mijita.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.638
Talking about sex at the table?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.723
What about the booby statue?

11:52.378 --> 11:54.213
I'll get it! I'll go.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
How are you? Thanks for the…

13:59.964 --> 14:03.008
Ay!
Everything looks delicious.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.770
Don't be rude.
We have to wait for everyone.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.604
The turkey.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.070
Rest? What? Is she tired?

16:05.339 --> 16:07.383
Look at that beauty!

16:07.466 --> 16:10.678
Why go to Paris?
You already have a Michelin star here.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.061
The community here
values him too, right, mijo?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.571
Chuey is a tough critic.

16:57.766 --> 17:01.228
Unbelievable! We had an
agreement. You weren't gonna let him go.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.771
Me? I didn't know.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.233
- Stubborn, old man.
- What's with you?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.568
What's bothering you?

17:24.168 --> 17:26.336
Ernesto, I'm warning you.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.463
I'm warning you.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.685
Again with this? Hm?

17:41.769 --> 17:44.980
I'm the one to blame?
Alejandro came back to help his father.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.732
Yes, he wanted to stay, Casimiro.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.780
It was an accident.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.958
What did you to say to him?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.503
"Stop wasting your time!
You won't make money with that"

18:36.073 --> 18:37.699
Beatriz, tell them the truth.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.079
We don't need his money.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.674
"I don't want
to see your face again!"

18:53.757 --> 18:57.469
¡Basta ya! I won't have
this kind of talk at my own table!

18:57.553 --> 18:59.596
With such disrespect!

20:33.023 --> 20:35.067
Thank you, Lupita. Sit down.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.536
My son is right.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.706
I'm not a saint.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.421
It's true what Ernesto said.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.594
Maybe I never told your dad
to give up his dream straight out…

21:05.222 --> 21:07.349
but I always told him that family…

21:08.433 --> 21:09.393
comes first.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.647
And that's what he did.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.358
No, let me finish.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.487
The day I left Mexico,
I didn't want to come.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.826
But my father told me
it's what I had to do.

21:27.744 --> 21:28.745
To sacrifice…

21:30.038 --> 21:31.832
everything for the family.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.920
Because that's what men do.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.718
They sacrifice.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.597
Leaving Mexico…

21:49.308 --> 21:50.684
without Delfina…

21:53.520 --> 21:54.855
without my boys…

21:58.108 --> 21:59.234
not knowing if…

22:00.360 --> 22:03.947
I'd ever see them again,
was the hardest decision of my life.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.869
But it had to be done.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.999
The last time I ever saw my dad…

22:15.250 --> 22:16.793
sitting on his horse…

22:18.879 --> 22:21.256
wearing his Tejana and his boots…

22:22.549 --> 22:23.842
He was very proud.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.057
Teaching me the only way he knew…

22:32.601 --> 22:34.311
how to love his family.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.235
And I tried to love my boys…

22:45.489 --> 22:47.366
the only way I know how.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.127
Ana, you were too young

23:44.423 --> 23:45.966
I felt responsible.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.026
I love you so much.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.150
Don't feel obligated to,

26:50.692 --> 26:52.902
but you can stay as long as you like.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.660
I was thinking…

27:01.536 --> 27:04.372
How about I stay until the hearing?

27:05.874 --> 27:08.084
I'd like to spend some time with you.

28:08.812 --> 28:09.896
What's that noise?

29:19.466 --> 29:21.509
I love you too, Casimiro.
