<i>at my apartment to watch
the Super Bowl.</i>

00:04.903 --> 00:06.777
<i>Well, not all of us.</i>

00:06.778 --> 00:10.106
ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to
Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.

00:10.107 --> 00:12.592
Get a load of that guy.

00:12.593 --> 00:15.965
You think that's his real number?

00:15.966 --> 00:16.933
Well, that explains

00:16.934 --> 00:19.375
where Barney is. Dibs on his wings.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.465
(ringtone playing) Hey, guys. Hey.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.799
Does anyone know who won the Super Bowl?

00:35.800 --> 00:37.701
You were there. It was the... I won,

00:37.702 --> 00:41.402
because I am now in
possession of a magic phone

00:41.403 --> 00:42.936
that always rings.

00:42.937 --> 00:44.270
And do you know who's always

00:44.271 --> 00:45.371
usually on the other end?

00:45.372 --> 00:46.471
A chick.

00:46.472 --> 00:48.873
So how many chicks do I have calling me now?

00:48.874 --> 00:50.875
Infinity.

00:50.876 --> 00:51.877
(ringtone continues)

00:51.878 --> 00:53.781
You guys remember Ranjit. Hello.

00:53.782 --> 00:55.583
TED & MARSHALL: Hey, Ranjit,
good to see you. Hey.

00:55.584 --> 00:57.219
I've enlisted Ranjit's
services as my personal driver

00:57.220 --> 00:58.388
because for the next week,

00:58.389 --> 00:59.989
I will be sleeping with hundreds of women,

00:59.990 --> 01:03.461
and I don't want to take the subway,
'cause you know, germs.

01:03.462 --> 01:05.364
Wait, you're actually gonna
hook up with these girls

01:05.364 --> 01:07.332
that call you? Oh, indubitably.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.933
I'm meeting the first one here any minute.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.668
Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater.

01:10.669 --> 01:12.436
Based on her texts, she's dirty,

01:12.437 --> 01:15.772
dyslexic, and wants to 96 me.

01:15.773 --> 01:18.141
Semicolon, end parentheses.

01:18.142 --> 01:19.508
TED: This ought to be good.

01:19.509 --> 01:21.410
I can only imagine the quality
of girl that... Oh, my God,

01:21.411 --> 01:23.778
<i>you are the guy from the Super Bowl.</i>

01:23.779 --> 01:27.515
Magic phone, guys, magic phone.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.516
ROBIN: Hey, guys, hey, Ranjit.

01:29.517 --> 01:31.485
How's it going? Hey. Hello. Hey.

01:31.486 --> 01:33.822
That beer looks a little flat.

01:33.823 --> 01:34.824
It's Scotch.

01:34.825 --> 01:35.825
Whoa.

01:35.826 --> 01:36.859
Something troubling you, kiddo?

01:36.860 --> 01:39.095
(sighs) Don.

01:39.096 --> 01:42.400
<i>Don was Aunt Robin's co-host on her morning
show.</i>

01:42.401 --> 01:44.202
<i>Now, even though her show
was on so early</i>

01:44.203 --> 01:45.336
<i>that no one watched,</i>

01:45.337 --> 01:47.673
<i>Aunt Robin was a consummate
professional,</i>

01:47.674 --> 01:48.975
<i>but Don was not.</i>

01:48.976 --> 01:50.076
Oh, yeah.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.646
<i>But that morning,
Don had gone too far.</i>

01:52.647 --> 01:57.086
Now, that's what I call having
a "woof" over your head.

01:57.087 --> 01:59.354
Don.

01:59.355 --> 02:00.523
Don?

02:00.524 --> 02:04.127
<i>Why is Ulee's Gold in
every crossword?</i>

02:04.128 --> 02:06.363
Oh, it's me? Sorry, sorry.

02:06.364 --> 02:09.166
Uh, next Sunday is Valentine's Day,

02:09.167 --> 02:11.035
and one lucky patient will be receiving

02:11.036 --> 02:15.206
a very special chocolate heart-
a human heart.

02:15.207 --> 02:16.241
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.509
I've been meaning to ask you.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.079
Robin, do you have any, uh,
Valentine's Day plans?

02:21.248 --> 02:22.715
He asked you out?

02:22.716 --> 02:24.984
He asked me out. That's crazy.

02:24.985 --> 02:26.920
And they use "Ulee" because of the vowels.

02:26.921 --> 02:27.920
Ah.

02:27.921 --> 02:29.222
What did you say? Well,

02:29.223 --> 02:32.458
we were on the air,
I was on the spot, so I said okay.

02:32.459 --> 02:33.726
(chuckles)

02:33.727 --> 02:37.730
Robin, you are going to marry
this guy so freaking hard.

02:37.731 --> 02:39.064
Right in the butt.

02:39.065 --> 02:41.967
What?! No, I hate Don,

02:41.968 --> 02:43.134
and now I can't cancel

02:43.135 --> 02:45.403
because I said I would go
out with him on the air.

02:45.404 --> 02:46.871
What would your viewer think?

02:46.872 --> 02:48.072
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:48.073 --> 02:49.740
you said you'd go out
with him on Valentine's?

02:49.741 --> 02:50.775
I thought we had plans.

02:50.776 --> 02:51.943
What, getting drunk

02:51.944 --> 02:54.546
and cleaning the apartment was a plan?

02:54.547 --> 02:59.083
I did not say it was a good plan.

02:59.084 --> 03:01.185
Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now,

03:01.186 --> 03:04.589
and it is getting interesting.
Look at these texts.

03:04.590 --> 03:06.091
Read this one.

03:06.092 --> 03:07.092
Yowza!

03:07.093 --> 03:09.161
Now, look at this one. Does she text

03:09.162 --> 03:10.596
her mother with those fingers?

03:10.597 --> 03:11.830
Now, look at this one.

03:12.265 --> 03:13.565
Or this one

03:13.566 --> 03:15.100
or this one or this one.

03:15.101 --> 03:16.201
Okay, okay, okay,

03:16.202 --> 03:17.936
buddy, how, how about you do this?

03:17.937 --> 03:20.738
Go nail that girl, then read your texts.

03:20.739 --> 03:22.206
I can't do that, Ted. (ringtone playing)

03:22.207 --> 03:25.476
I just can't hook up with a
girl if there is a hotter girl

03:25.477 --> 03:28.779
out there with whom up can be hooked.

03:28.780 --> 03:31.315
Isn't there always a hotter girl?

03:31.316 --> 03:32.283
I know.

03:32.284 --> 03:34.118
Isn't it wonderful?

03:35.054 --> 03:36.187
Go for Barney.

03:36.188 --> 03:37.688
Cut to the chase-- what's your cup size?

03:37.689 --> 03:38.890
Oh, hi, Mom.

03:40.559 --> 03:42.660
There's always a hotter girl.

03:42.661 --> 03:44.461
Isn't that the problem in a nutshell?

03:44.462 --> 03:46.330
There's too many options-
you got Internet dating,

03:46.331 --> 03:47.297
you got bars...

03:47.298 --> 03:48.398
Holding up

03:48.399 --> 03:49.967
your phone number on national TV.

03:49.968 --> 03:50.968
(both chuckle)

03:50.969 --> 03:53.571
I never had that problem.

03:53.572 --> 03:57.676
When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage,

03:57.677 --> 04:01.547
and I love my wife more and more every day.

04:01.548 --> 04:02.782
Hmm. MARSHALL: It is true.

04:02.783 --> 04:05.485
It's, it's very rare
that two people just meet

04:05.486 --> 04:07.387
and fall madly in love, like Robin and Don.

04:07.388 --> 04:08.555
Oh,

04:08.556 --> 04:10.523
we-we're not even, like,
going out for dinner.

04:10.524 --> 04:12.025
We're just hanging out at his place.

04:12.026 --> 04:13.192
LILY & TED: Ooh...

04:13.193 --> 04:14.460
No, it's not like that.

04:14.461 --> 04:16.396
It's just us and a bunch of other people.

04:16.397 --> 04:18.331
Oh. Oh. Whoo...

04:18.332 --> 04:22.735
Wait, Robin, what exactly did
Don say when he asked you out?

04:22.736 --> 04:24.704
I'm having some friends over
at my place for a little party.

04:24.705 --> 04:26.106
You should come by if you want.

04:26.107 --> 04:28.175
Uh...

04:29.043 --> 04:31.345
Okay.

04:31.346 --> 04:35.348
Robin, Don didn't ask you out.

04:35.349 --> 04:37.484
Uh, of course he asked me out.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.652
Uh, no, he didn't.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.253
Yes, he did.

04:40.788 --> 04:41.821
He did.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.290
He did-- he did!

04:43.291 --> 04:44.424
Okay.

04:44.425 --> 04:45.425
Well, dog

04:45.426 --> 04:46.426
my cats.

04:46.427 --> 04:47.861
I think I know what's going on here.

04:47.862 --> 04:51.397
Robin, did you want Don to ask you out?

04:51.398 --> 04:52.932
What?! (laughter)

04:52.933 --> 04:54.967
No, I hate Don.

04:54.968 --> 04:57.303
I-I can't stop thinking
about how much I hate him.

04:57.304 --> 04:58.972
It's like, it's like all the time.

04:58.973 --> 05:00.640
I just want to attack him

05:00.641 --> 05:02.075
and rip his stupid clothes off

05:02.076 --> 05:03.810
and just spank him with his little paddle

05:03.811 --> 05:05.978
until his bum's all red.

05:05.979 --> 05:07.380
Shut up!

05:08.249 --> 05:10.717
See?

05:10.718 --> 05:13.487
That right there is what
free will gets you--

05:13.488 --> 05:16.457
constant, ego-shattering uncertainty.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.525
I'm done with that.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.994
I want what Ranjit has.

05:18.995 --> 05:20.629
I've spent my entire adult life

05:20.630 --> 05:22.464
looking for the perfect woman,

05:22.465 --> 05:25.134
and I'm spending Valentine's
Day scrubbing the toilet.

05:25.135 --> 05:26.435
I need someone else

05:26.436 --> 05:29.271
to find me that woman.

05:29.272 --> 05:33.908
Marshall, Lily, arranged marriage me.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.477
(ringtone playing) Or this one

05:35.478 --> 05:38.346
or this one or this one.

05:43.264 --> 05:45.751
You want us to arrange your marriage?

05:45.752 --> 05:46.697
Absolutely.

05:46.732 --> 05:48.391
Look, there's two sides to dating, right?

05:48.426 --> 05:50.114
Picking and getting picked.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.864
Getting picked I'm good at.

05:51.899 --> 05:54.039
Ladies love Teddy West Side.

05:55.541 --> 05:57.709
You're waiting for me to comment

05:57.710 --> 06:00.646
on your self-assigned nickname.

06:00.647 --> 06:02.782
All right, well, here's my comment.

06:02.783 --> 06:04.451
I love it. Really?

06:04.452 --> 06:06.586
Teddy West Side, continue.

06:06.587 --> 06:07.721
It's the picking I suck at.

06:07.722 --> 06:10.090
I pick the wrong girls, but you guys--

06:10.091 --> 06:11.358
you're the best pickers I know.

06:11.359 --> 06:12.593
You picked each other.

06:12.594 --> 06:14.028
Aw-- well, with a slight assist

06:14.029 --> 06:15.430
from the Wesleyan Housing Department.

06:15.431 --> 06:18.900
And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir.

06:18.901 --> 06:20.568
Get out there, find me a girl.

06:20.569 --> 06:22.236
We'll double-date on Valentine's Day.

06:22.237 --> 06:24.839
If I like her, I will marry her...

06:24.840 --> 06:27.274
if she's cool with it, and she will be...

06:27.275 --> 06:29.243
'cause I'll wear my nice blazer.

06:29.244 --> 06:33.980
I love that blazer almost
as much as Robin loves Don.

06:33.981 --> 06:35.115
I do not love Don.

06:35.116 --> 06:36.149
Robin,

06:36.150 --> 06:37.650
neurologically speaking,

06:37.651 --> 06:39.952
the part of the human brain
that makes you hate people

06:39.953 --> 06:42.021
is located right next
to the part of the brain

06:42.022 --> 06:43.556
that makes you want to jump people's bones.

06:43.557 --> 06:45.391
The two responses are so similar,

06:45.392 --> 06:46.625
it's hard to tell them apart.

06:46.626 --> 06:49.027
You know what it's like? Wait.

06:49.028 --> 06:50.028
I have to get a book.

06:50.029 --> 06:51.330
Give me 30 seconds!

06:51.331 --> 06:52.965
Okay, this is fun.

06:52.966 --> 06:53.966
Look at this picture.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.601
It's a rabbit.

06:55.602 --> 06:57.003
You can look at it for hours

06:57.004 --> 07:00.239
and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit,

07:00.240 --> 07:02.041
but then one day you look at it

07:02.042 --> 07:03.677
and you realize-- wait a second--

07:03.678 --> 07:05.979
it's a duck.

07:05.980 --> 07:08.148
Hmm. It's a rabbit, it's a duck.

07:08.149 --> 07:10.117
Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck.

07:10.118 --> 07:11.252
Isn't this fun?

07:11.253 --> 07:12.720
<i>NARRATOR: It sure was.</i>

07:12.721 --> 07:13.788
Well, relationships are like that.

07:13.789 --> 07:16.458
I mean, look, when you first met Don,

07:16.459 --> 07:17.392
you hated him.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.394
You thought, "This guy is a duck,"

07:19.395 --> 07:21.397
but one of these days,
you're going to realize,

07:21.398 --> 07:23.299
"This is actually something that I love.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
He's a rabbit."

07:24.301 --> 07:25.401
TED: Whoa.

07:25.402 --> 07:27.536
I think you got it backwards there, buddy.

07:27.537 --> 07:29.972
The duck is the thing you love,

07:29.973 --> 07:32.474
the rabbit is the thing you hate.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.809
What? Yeah, I gotta

07:33.810 --> 07:35.110
agree; ducks up, rabbits down.

07:35.111 --> 07:37.645
Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.

07:37.646 --> 07:38.846
MARSHALL: Ducks are...

07:38.847 --> 07:39.947
Ducks are..

07:39.948 --> 07:41.015
MARSHALL: Rabbits are adorable!

07:41.016 --> 07:42.250
Ducks are, like...

07:42.251 --> 07:44.886
Have you ever been in a fight with a duck?

07:44.887 --> 07:46.255
I mean, ducks are jerks!

07:46.256 --> 07:48.457
<i>This led to one of the most
intense arguments</i>

07:48.458 --> 07:50.159
<i>our group has ever had.</i>

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
(fast-forwarding)

07:51.161 --> 07:52.261
Duck is delicious!

07:52.262 --> 07:54.063
Rabbit is all gamey!

07:54.064 --> 07:55.764
We're not talking about flavor, Ted!

07:55.765 --> 07:56.865
Flavor counts!

07:56.866 --> 07:58.333
(fast-forwarding)

07:58.334 --> 08:00.803
Who carries around a
duck's foot for good luck?!

08:00.804 --> 08:01.837
Anyone?!

08:01.838 --> 08:03.105
(fast-forwarding)

08:03.106 --> 08:04.540
You wrap yourself in a comforter

08:04.541 --> 08:05.841
stuffed with rabbit hair!

08:05.842 --> 08:09.544
I'll wrap myself in one
stuffed with duck feathers!

08:09.545 --> 08:10.713
Who's cozier?

08:10.714 --> 08:13.749
No, no, no, no, but who's cozier?!

08:13.750 --> 08:14.750
(fast-forwarding)

08:14.751 --> 08:16.685
Hold on! I have to get another book!

08:16.686 --> 08:18.187
(fast-forwarding)

08:18.188 --> 08:24.193
(shouting in native tongue)

08:24.194 --> 08:25.828
(fast-forwarding)

08:25.829 --> 08:27.897
Then why don't we take a rabbit, a duck,

08:27.898 --> 08:30.733
<i>stick 'em in a cardboard box, and let them
fight it out?!</i>

08:30.734 --> 08:32.235
Because it's illegal, Ted!

08:32.236 --> 08:34.236
Only if we bet on it, Marshall!

08:34.238 --> 08:35.804
(fast-forwarding)

08:35.806 --> 08:38.140
Fine!

08:38.142 --> 08:39.442
I concede!

08:40.243 --> 08:41.577
You win!

08:41.578 --> 08:43.645
Say it.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.815
You have to say it.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.684
Ducks good...

08:51.354 --> 08:52.788
(faintly): rabbits are bad.

08:52.789 --> 08:54.389
Yes! Yes!

08:54.390 --> 08:55.857
Yes! It feels so good!

08:55.858 --> 08:57.092
Yes.

08:57.093 --> 08:58.927
Thank you. And Don is--

08:58.928 --> 09:01.430
and always will be-- a rabbit.

09:01.431 --> 09:03.866
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.434
Think about it. Don?

09:05.435 --> 09:07.403
Donald?

09:07.404 --> 09:09.939
Donald... Duck?

09:10.974 --> 09:15.611
And what, I wonder,
does Donald Duck never wear?

09:15.612 --> 09:16.546
Pants.

09:16.547 --> 09:17.947
Pants.

09:19.116 --> 09:21.651
Don's a duck.

09:21.652 --> 09:22.985
(sighs) (sighs)

09:22.986 --> 09:24.153
Permission to say "lawyered"?

09:24.154 --> 09:24.955
I'll allow it.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.556
Lawyered.

09:26.557 --> 09:29.225
<i>Yes, kids, sometimes
there's a fine line</i>

09:29.226 --> 09:30.527
<i>between love and hate.</i>

09:30.528 --> 09:31.694
<i>Case in point:</i>

09:31.695 --> 09:34.431

09:36.867 --> 09:40.970

09:40.971 --> 09:42.472
I should get that.

09:45.509 --> 09:47.143
Go for Barney.

09:47.144 --> 09:49.179
Look, I'm sort of in the middle of someone--

09:49.180 --> 09:50.847
something right now, and I...

09:50.848 --> 09:53.884
You're a hot lady bullfighter?

09:53.885 --> 09:56.720
You gotta go.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.188

10:13.568 --> 10:16.870
Would you excuse me for one moment?

10:16.871 --> 10:18.138
Go for Barney.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.339

Well, hello...

10:43.866 --> 10:46.201
I realize that you're very busy,

10:46.202 --> 10:48.002

10:48.003 --> 10:49.170
Okay.

10:59.347 --> 11:01.281
(sputtering)

11:01.282 --> 11:03.583
And that's my bad leg.

11:03.584 --> 11:05.352
Very bad.

11:05.353 --> 11:08.422
(ringtone playing)

11:08.423 --> 11:10.324
Are you okay?

11:10.325 --> 11:11.458
Yeah, of course.

You know what? We forgot about this.

I'm sure Ted did, also.

I'm just saying, if they do,

14:02.800 --> 14:05.068
I'll just say, "Well,
I got a dinner rez," and then...

14:05.069 --> 14:06.203
Wait. This is the best part.

14:06.204 --> 14:07.738
I've been working on this for a while.

14:07.739 --> 14:08.472
Hmm.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.074
I'll duck out.

Ha, ha, ha.

But, yeah, do that.

14:14.513 --> 14:15.947
Mm-hmm.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.851
Hello, Robin.

14:19.852 --> 14:21.353
(shrieks) Oh!

14:21.354 --> 14:23.988
Well, I got a dinner rez.

14:26.027 --> 14:28.956
Oh! Oh, God, Don,
what the hell are you doing?!

14:28.991 --> 14:31.282
I don't know. It's something
called The Naked Man.

14:31.317 --> 14:33.430
I read about it on some guy's blog.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.066
My God, I'm so stupid.

14:35.101 --> 14:36.859
Why did I ever think it would
work on someone like you?

14:36.838 --> 14:39.573
Yeah, 'cause I would never...

14:39.574 --> 14:42.944
Could, like... standards, so, you know.

14:42.945 --> 14:44.913
I-I thought this was a party.

14:44.914 --> 14:47.015
I only said that to get
you to come over here.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.449
I didn't think you'd bring a date.

14:48.450 --> 14:49.784
Ted's not my date.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.352
He's a friend. Oh, God.

14:51.353 --> 14:53.554
You probably think I'm some
kind of playboy now, right?

14:56.958 --> 14:59.526
You could say that.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.628
So he's a rabbit.

15:01.629 --> 15:03.363
At least you know for sure.

15:03.364 --> 15:05.031
Ted, this may hurt a little.

15:05.032 --> 15:08.467
I'm recycling your old
Architecture Weekly Magazines.

15:08.468 --> 15:09.835
What are you doing?

15:09.836 --> 15:12.138
Cleaning. You go on your date.

15:12.139 --> 15:13.973
Happy Valentine's Day.

15:19.213 --> 15:20.880
Oh, thank God you're here.

15:20.881 --> 15:22.315
Yeah, I've been thinking.

15:22.316 --> 15:24.250
Um, maybe we should call
this whole thing off.

15:24.251 --> 15:26.519
No! Ted, we got her. What?

15:26.520 --> 15:28.387
We got her. It's, it's the craziest thing.

15:28.388 --> 15:31.257
We were searching all week,
and then, a couple hours ago...

15:31.258 --> 15:32.192
Trudy?

15:32.193 --> 15:33.226
Married.

15:33.227 --> 15:34.493
Blah, blah?

15:34.494 --> 15:35.061
Committed.

15:35.062 --> 15:35.861
Relationship?

15:35.862 --> 15:36.696
Bellevue.

15:36.697 --> 15:38.698
Natalie?

15:38.699 --> 15:40.900
Ted's her least favorite
person in the world.

15:40.901 --> 15:43.236
Well, she's not getting any younger.

15:43.237 --> 15:44.370
(ringtone plays)

15:44.371 --> 15:46.138
Get rid of it!

15:46.139 --> 15:46.873
What?

15:46.874 --> 15:48.441
This phone is cursed.

15:48.442 --> 15:50.109
Cursed, I tell you!

15:50.110 --> 15:53.079
I try to ignore it,
but it just never stops ringing!

15:53.080 --> 15:54.914
It's ruining my life!

15:54.915 --> 15:56.116
I should get that.

15:56.117 --> 15:57.050
No, please.

15:57.051 --> 15:58.118
Please!

15:58.119 --> 15:59.452
Please, Marshall, let me answer it.

15:59.453 --> 16:00.620
It could be an emergency.

16:00.621 --> 16:02.856
She could be trapped in a giant bra!

16:02.857 --> 16:04.524
Barney, Barney...

16:04.525 --> 16:07.027
let it go... to voice mail.

16:07.028 --> 16:08.528
(cries)

16:08.529 --> 16:10.697
(mumbling)

16:10.698 --> 16:12.265
Okay.

16:12.266 --> 16:15.268
(crying)

16:15.269 --> 16:17.537
We have to find Ted a wife.
We're being too choosy.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.538
It almost doesn't matter
who it is at this point.

16:19.539 --> 16:21.540
Okay.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.408
(ringtone continues)

16:23.409 --> 16:25.110
It's a phone girl? I know.

16:25.111 --> 16:26.244
I know, but no.

16:26.245 --> 16:27.746
Then we met her, and Ted,

16:27.747 --> 16:31.515
she's a world-class violinist,
she's a gourmet cook, and...

16:31.516 --> 16:33.618
<i>she can quote every line
from Caddyshack.</i>

16:33.619 --> 16:36.154
Wow.

16:37.490 --> 16:38.823
Hello, Ted.

16:38.824 --> 16:42.461
And what brings you to
this nape of the woods?

16:42.462 --> 16:43.896
Neck of the wape?

16:43.897 --> 16:45.732
Why are you here?

16:47.468 --> 16:49.303
<i>NARRATOR: So we all had dinner.</i>

16:49.304 --> 16:52.039
<i>And kids, Marshall and Lily's hard work had
paid off,</i>

16:52.040 --> 16:54.007

16:54.008 --> 16:55.242
<i>In fact...</i>

16:55.243 --> 16:57.945
Oh, but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.

16:57.946 --> 17:00.313
Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!

17:00.314 --> 17:02.249
Well, unfortunately,

17:02.250 --> 17:04.718
I'm going to have to leave the country soon

17:04.719 --> 17:06.855
because my visa is about to expire.

17:06.856 --> 17:08.723
LILY (whispering): She needs to get married!

17:08.723 --> 17:10.758
(whispering): Federal law expressly dictates

17:10.759 --> 17:12.926
that a foreign national
can't maintain residency

17:12.928 --> 17:16.063
for longer than six months
without a work visa, so...

17:16.064 --> 17:17.997
NARRATOR: But when it came down to it...

17:17.998 --> 17:19.933
And you, sir? The rabbit or the duck?

17:19.934 --> 17:21.099
What?

17:21.101 --> 17:22.300
It's a prix-fixe menu

17:22.301 --> 17:23.569
for Valentine's Day,

17:23.569 --> 17:25.804
and we're already out of steak,
fish and chicken.

17:25.805 --> 17:27.606
So, rabbit or duck?

17:33.145 --> 17:35.113
Rabbit. Sorry, guys.

17:35.114 --> 17:36.648
I got to go.

17:36.649 --> 17:39.517
Why would Ted order rabbit
if he was just gonna run out?

17:39.518 --> 17:42.520
(whimpering): I need it back!
Where's the phone?

17:42.521 --> 17:43.955
Well, hello.

17:43.956 --> 17:45.490
Oh, I met you already.

17:45.491 --> 17:46.891
Where's the phone?!

17:46.892 --> 17:48.359
(sighs) It's hidden.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.828
Where?!

17:49.829 --> 17:51.396
<i>NARRATOR: Where had Aunt
Lily hidden the phone?</i>

17:51.397 --> 17:53.532
<i>Well, to answer that, we have to back up a
little bit.</i>

17:53.533 --> 17:55.367
You go on your date.

17:55.368 --> 17:57.070
Happy Valentine's Day.

17:57.071 --> 17:59.705
(ringtone playing faintly)

18:04.979 --> 18:07.214
(ringtone playing louder)

18:07.215 --> 18:09.217
It's Barney's phone.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.253
I wonder how it got in there.

18:12.254 --> 18:13.855
Ted?

18:13.856 --> 18:15.324
Come on. Big date.

18:17.426 --> 18:18.994
Ah, what's the harm?

18:18.995 --> 18:20.162
Hello?

18:20.163 --> 18:22.698
<i>And just like that, I was hooked.</i>

18:22.699 --> 18:24.332
Terrific. I will see you there.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.301
And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer.

18:26.302 --> 18:29.871
Oh, I think you'll know the
blazer when you see it.

18:29.872 --> 18:31.640
Ooh. I gotta go.

18:31.641 --> 18:32.644
Oh, thank God you're here.

18:32.742 --> 18:34.776
So... rabbit or duck?

18:41.650 --> 18:43.050
Rabbit. Sorry, guys.

18:43.051 --> 18:44.985
I gotta go.

18:44.986 --> 18:47.755
<i>Well, hello.</i>

18:47.756 --> 18:49.123
(ringtone plays)

18:49.124 --> 18:50.791
Sorry, babe. I gotta take this.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.526
Barney's phone.

18:52.527 --> 18:53.460
Teddy West Side speaking.

18:53.461 --> 18:54.695
<i>It's my phone!</i>

18:54.696 --> 18:55.829
I am taking it back!

18:55.830 --> 18:57.331
And I'm taking your cool nickname, too!

18:57.332 --> 18:58.532
Barney West Side speaking.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.535
No! I love it so much! It just keeps ringing

19:00.536 --> 19:02.037
and ringing and ringing. Hey, baby.

19:02.038 --> 19:03.171
Give it to me. Come on.

19:03.172 --> 19:04.773
Stop. It's mine now.

19:04.774 --> 19:05.841
It's not your--

19:05.842 --> 19:08.077
Lily. Ah!

19:08.078 --> 19:09.211
(screaming) No!

19:09.212 --> 19:10.445
Oops.

19:11.448 --> 19:12.815
(scoffs)

19:12.316 --> 19:14.483
Being single sucks. Mm.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.351
It turns you into a crazy person.

19:16.352 --> 19:17.987
I know.

19:17.988 --> 19:20.390
So much running around and
freaking out, and for what?

19:20.391 --> 19:22.057
It's all so you can find someone

19:22.058 --> 19:23.492
you can sit on a couch

19:23.493 --> 19:25.127
and put off cleaning the bathroom with.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.295
(chuckles)

19:26.296 --> 19:28.130
Well, the joke's on the rest of the world,

19:28.131 --> 19:29.965
because we can do that on our own.

19:30.535 --> 19:31.751
Exactly.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.145
Exactly.

19:33.180 --> 19:33.984
Hmm.

19:44.625 --> 19:45.692
Robin, I-I have to apologize--

19:45.693 --> 19:47.893
Just save it. Let's just do the news.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.463
No, listen.

19:51.464 --> 19:53.164
After you left the other night,

19:53.165 --> 19:54.532
I was embarrassed.

19:54.533 --> 19:55.800
Not because I was naked.

19:55.801 --> 19:57.601
I'm actually pretty okay with my body.

19:57.602 --> 19:58.635
Clearly.

19:58.636 --> 20:00.204
(sighs)

20:00.205 --> 20:02.139
I got married in college.

20:02.140 --> 20:04.474
I just got divorced three months ago.

20:04.475 --> 20:06.910
I have no idea how to be single.

20:06.911 --> 20:09.246
But that's not why I was embarrassed.

20:09.247 --> 20:11.182
I was embarrassed about my behavior

20:11.183 --> 20:12.784
right here at Channel...

20:12.785 --> 20:14.686
Um...

20:14.687 --> 20:17.222
It starts with a one.
I know that much. Uh...

20:17.223 --> 20:18.858
Twelve. 12! Channel 12.

20:18.859 --> 20:20.526
I mean, just look at your mug.

20:20.527 --> 20:21.794
Right.

20:21.795 --> 20:24.531
Well, no. You look at this mug.

20:24.532 --> 20:25.966
You are a tremendous news anchor.

20:25.967 --> 20:29.035
And you deserve a c
o-anchor who gives a crap.

20:29.970 --> 20:33.040
And from here on out, that's gonna be me.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.442
Well, I'll believe that when I see it.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.610
Well, you'll see it right now.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.613
I'll go get you some coffee.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.218
Don...

20:44.219 --> 20:45.952
You're wearing pants.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.123
Well, look at that.

20:51.025 --> 20:53.393
Ah, duck.
