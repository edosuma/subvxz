WEBVTT

00:01.626 --> 00:03.920
Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.255
Where even are we anyway?

00:05.338 --> 00:07.882
Valley Road. Where they found Dad
after the heart attack.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.676
Why? It's just a random road.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.928
Haven't you ever wondered why was he here?

00:12.012 --> 00:14.222
Your dad was after this guy, John,
I worked for a few times.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.642
Hired me to do some little stuff.
Scare people, break windows, slash tires.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.769
-You know John's last name?
-No.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.565
You saved the judge, the chief,
and I'm pretty sure you saved me too.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.442
Nah, Hooch did most of the work.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.902
Well then, Hooch is a hero.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.237
So are you.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.658
Uh…

00:33.742 --> 00:37.579
-Hi.
-Erica Mounir, this is Brooke Mailer.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.997
Brooke, this is Erica.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.250
Scott, you didn't tell me
how adorable the dog lady was.

00:42.334 --> 00:46.004
You didn't tell me
that the prosecutor had such great hair.

00:48.214 --> 00:52.761
Hey, do you think that we can reconnect?
Grab some dinner sometime?

00:52.844 --> 00:54.304
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

01:13.031 --> 01:17.077
Too many balconies. Lacks taste.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.124
Oh, yeah. That's good.

01:38.556 --> 01:42.102
No one of importance.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.109
You telling the truth? I don't buy it.
Tell me the truth!

01:49.734 --> 01:50.985
Oh. Love this song.

01:55.907 --> 01:56.908
Yeah.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.622
-Ooh! Oh, gosh. Whew.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.208
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.460
What are you listening to?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.504
Oh, uh, I have no idea.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.297
Just on a random shuffle. There we go.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.133
Laura, what are we doing here?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.884
You made me drop everything to drive here.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.803
Shh. We are investigating.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.222
You know those old records,
the ones I had Grady get for me?

02:19.305 --> 02:20.849
-Yeah.
-Well…

02:23.268 --> 02:25.562
Stuff in there was a total game-changer,
okay?

02:25.645 --> 02:28.773
Turns out that guy from the trailer park,
the sleazebag, was telling us the truth.

02:28.857 --> 02:32.652
Dad was tailing this land developer guy,
John Gillen. And he lives right there.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.945
Let me see the police records.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.116
Okay. John Gillen and Associates.
Commercial land development.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.200
Permit lawsuit.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.327
There's no charges here.
It's not even an arrest.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.955
Look how much stuff is in there.
Dad was tailing him for weeks.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.498
He's gotta be guilty of something.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.001
Okay. A, that's not how the law works.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.878
B, Dad hated all land developers,

02:49.961 --> 02:52.380
and C,
you could've told me this on the phone!

02:53.840 --> 02:56.217
If I had, would you have let me
come with you to talk to him?

02:56.301 --> 02:58.928
-No.
-Precisely. Shall we?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.890
You're hopped-up on juice boxes,
and I don't like it.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.278
Mr. Gillen? Hello?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.746
See, this is weird. His car's out front.
No sound in the house. It's 8:45 p.m.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.081
-It's a big house.
-Oh, God.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.874
What if he's keeping someone prisoner?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.001
Bad guys always have basements.
This is textbook.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.419
What textbook?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.672
-Oh, God. Oh, God. What did you do?

03:33.755 --> 03:36.091
-Me? I'm standing right here.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.636
-Mr. Gillen? Mr. Gillen, are you there?

03:39.719 --> 03:40.887
Hello! Mr. Gillen!

03:44.891 --> 03:45.892
Stay here.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.977
It's never good when it's open.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.814
-Mr. Gillen, are you here?
-

03:50.897 --> 03:52.565
Mr. Gillen, I heard the alarm.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.450
Mr. Gillen, are you here?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.630
What's happening?
-Aah! Geez, Laura.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.590
I told you to wait outside!

04:17.674 --> 04:20.593
You didn't say for how long! I counted
ten Mississippis, then I came inside.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.722
Laura! This isn't tag! Just-- Stay here.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.433
-For how many Mississippis?
-Oh, my God.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.397
I checked the house. There's nobody here.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.107
So, what happened? Where did he go?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.151
I don't know.
Wherever it was, he went in a hurry.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.653
See this? It's a gun case and ammunition.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.322
He grabbed his gun and left.
But why did he need it?

04:41.406 --> 04:43.199
Admit it! I'm onto something.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.660
You're onto a maybe-something.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.204
Ha! Yes!
I'm onto a maybe-something, Hooch!

04:48.288 --> 04:51.833
And look. We found this in the trash.
He orders from Hooked Fish.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.917
Maybe it's a clue?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.003
Columbo, you can't just break into
someone's house

04:55.086 --> 04:56.463
and look through their garbage.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.548
-Hooch, we gotta go.
-Oh, so-- Okay.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.010
Can I use the bathroom, please?
I drank an entire block of juice boxes.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.596
That's a good idea.
Leave more DNA evidence we were here.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.139
Oh, man.

05:53.770 --> 05:58.066
Comme on dit, fantastique.
Comme on dit, fantastique.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.150
All right.

05:59.651 --> 06:03.113
Now, when Brooke gets here, you're gonna
sit and stay, right? You hear me?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.865
Be good if you ever want to see
Mr. Horsey again.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.409
-Hey, Scott.
-Hey.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.368
What brings you by?

06:08.451 --> 06:11.955
Uh, this paperwork.
Good old-fashioned paperwork.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.206
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.749
Oh, and you brought Hooch.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.459
Come on in.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.796
So nice of you
to bring this by hand, by the way.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.047
You could have just emailed it.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.341
Pfft. You know. Computers, right?

06:24.676 --> 06:27.053
Um… Oh, hey.
You know, I was just thinking.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.347
I know you mentioned getting dinner,
or whatever.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.266
Oh, yeah. We totally should.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.144
Yeah. Um, so I've been brushing up
on my French…

06:34.227 --> 06:36.980
What do you say
to a French cuisine do-over?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
Oh, my God.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.817
I completely forgot about
the Cour de Lapin disaster.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.153
What did you order again? Spleen?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.155
-Yeah. That was an accident.
-

06:45.238 --> 06:49.200
Um, no. But, uh, there's this place,
Le Majestique.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.954
It's usually booked three months out,
but they randomly have an opening tonight.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.498
They're supposed to have a great
'87 Côtes du Rhone,

06:55.582 --> 06:59.544
and the coq au vin
is, comme on dit, fantastique.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.467
Answer the lady, Hooch.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.178
- His French is a little rusty.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.598
Um, s-so, what do you say? Le Majestique?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.309
I would love to, Scott.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.644
And you are very cute when you beg.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.401
Oh, this is good, Hooch.
We're making progress with Brooke.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.737
I think we might have
really turned a corner here.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.368
You know that was Hooch, right?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.245
-I seem to have lost my appetite.
-Me too.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.834
Ugh, did you eat a rat?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.378
-Ugh.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.798
Hey. What's up?

07:44.881 --> 07:47.425
Hey. I was just wondering
when you're gonna get here.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.095
Oh, no. We have training today.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.556
Yeah, kinda, sorta. Tuesdays at 8:30.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.433
I totally spaced.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.103
I had a meeting
at the US Attorney's office this morning,

07:58.186 --> 07:59.854
and now I gotta get to work.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.857
Oh. Um, that's where
your friend works, right?

08:02.941 --> 08:06.236
The one with the pretty skin
and she's super fit?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.320
Probably likes running?

08:07.404 --> 08:10.824
Uh, yeah. The attorney one.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.619
Um, hey. Listen. I am so sorry.
Can-- Can we reschedule?

08:14.703 --> 08:18.289
Yeah. Of course.
I mean, you know, probably.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.750
Uh, I'll check my schedule.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.920
Okay, awesome. I'm so sorry again.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.672
-Sorry.
-

08:29.718 --> 08:31.011
Oh, that's different.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.180
So, got a new job. Need a partner.

08:34.264 --> 08:38.226
It's a very cool job.
VCJ, as the kids say.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.936
-Do they say that?
-They will.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.941
Real estate fraud, wire fraud.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.278
Last seen in El Dorado, so I figured
we'd head up there today and, um--

08:48.361 --> 08:50.071
Um, I'm--

08:50.155 --> 08:52.699
Any other day,
I would love to go get this guy.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.200
Just I-- I have a thing tonight.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.410
Mm.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.580
Pretty sure you said you'd do any job
I needed help with last week.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.540
Yes, I did say that.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.250
Great. We'll head up in ten.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.627
I want to get there early
and scout venues for my wedding.

09:06.338 --> 09:10.300
I'm sorry. Um, you're-- You're engaged?
To, like, a regular person?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.010
I me-- I mean, to who?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.012
The most perfect woman in the world.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.349
Well, that is-- Good for you, man.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.685
Hey. This warrant we're serving.
Do you think we could be back by 6:00?

09:20.769 --> 09:22.729
We could put it out into the world. Sure.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.648
Vest up.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.984
-I'll drive.
-All right.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.946
-Guess we're going to El Dorado.
-

09:53.343 --> 09:56.805
Can we speed up a bit, maybe?
The way you drive, it's gonna be hours.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.515
You said we'd be back by 6:00.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.475
Nah, I said we'd put it out
into the world.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.978
What does that mean?
We're either back in time or we're not, X.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.523
Or it could be you're holding on
to these plans too tight.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.402
Maybe you should loosen up your grip.
Let it go. See if it comes back.

10:10.485 --> 10:15.073
If you let go of a reservation
at Le Majestique, it doesn't come back.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.866
It's gone.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.202
All right, amigo. Then we'll do our best.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.206
Those mountains… Transcendent.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.588
Stay right here, bud. I'll be right back.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.466
Yeah, I'm digging the vibe
of this El Dorado place.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.302
All these ancient trees, this soil--

10:36.386 --> 10:39.139
I mean, think about all the pioneers
who threw caution to the wind

10:39.222 --> 10:41.141
and came out West, seeking a better life.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.851
It's kinda like getting married.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.477
Great.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.438
Uh, yeah, should be pretty easy.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.522
Guy's in his 50s.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.691
Let's get it done, get back to SF.
I'll take the door.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.860
-Are you sure you don't want me to--
-I got it.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.655
I'll head around back, in case he squirts.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.906
All right.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
Police! US Marshals!

11:11.463 --> 11:12.547
-Hello.
-Leigh Anderson?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.090
We have a warrant for your arrest.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.636
Uh, no. There's no Leigh Anderson here.
I think you got the wrong house.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.513
I doubt that very much.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.642
Wow, you're kidding me.
Yeah, that does-- Looks a lot like me.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.727
You know what, Officer?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.729
I'm gonna go get my license,
and we can clear this up.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.522
Open the door, sir. Open the door.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.232
X!

11:31.316 --> 11:33.401
X, watch the exit! He's trying to run.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.987
X!

11:47.332 --> 11:49.793
That was a rush.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.128
It's like dropping
into the Banzai Pipeline.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.047
It was a rush losing the fugitive?

11:54.130 --> 11:58.093
Hey. You ride the wave, you wipe out.
There's always another wave.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.388
Call in the description of the car.
We'll look for more evidence inside.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.474
-Hooch, change of plans.

12:08.186 --> 12:12.190
-Hooch, easy. Calm down. Calm down.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.484
I found a cell phone bill.
Called in a phone warrant.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.405
Yeah, for a phone he probably ditched.
At least you found something.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.115
It looks like he barely lived here.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.158
All I found was
a bag of old art magazines.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.869
Nice. That's a good place to start
while we wait on this warrant.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.123
What's a good place to start?
Uh, Scenes of Surrealism?

12:28.206 --> 12:31.835
No, the bag. It's probably
where he's been shopping.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.671
That's actually a good lead.
I gotta start looking at bags.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.631
-Hooch, what's wrong with you?

12:36.715 --> 12:38.008
I don't know what's up with him.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.553
Okay, now. You know what?
We're just gonna…

12:46.516 --> 12:49.227
What the--
No, no. Hooch. Hooch, that's evidence.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.603
Come. No, no, no, no.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.689
Hooch, come back. Hooch.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.984
Stay. Stay.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.068
-Oh…

12:57.152 --> 12:58.528
Hooch, don't stay!

12:58.611 --> 13:01.865
Don't stay. Hooch, do not stay!

13:06.411 --> 13:08.496
-Oh, man. That smell is so bad.
-

13:09.789 --> 13:10.790
Yo.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.000
Hey, Juice.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.252
You got a location
on Leigh Anderson's phone yet?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.713
Yeah, I just checked a minute ago.
Nothing.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
Cool. Can you check again?
We're kinda in a rush.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.260
Hooch just got sprayed by a skunk,
and Scott has a date tonight.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.554
What-- Scott Turner has a date?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.348
-With Brooke?
-Yeah.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.309
Ooh. Look who's fancy.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.146
Oh, wait. Hol' up.
Anderson's still in town.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.523
Then I guess we're staying
in town until we catch him.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.400
Might have to put that date on hold.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.902
Can't just walk away from a manhunt.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.820
Nobody's walking away. No walking.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.031
We're just gonna catch him fast
and go home.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.283
Good luck with that.
-Thanks, J.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.161
Of course.
Oh, and, uh, Scotty, for the skunk spray?

13:48.244 --> 13:49.954
Maybe try a tomato juice bath.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.915
From what I hear,
it works great for a skunking.

13:51.998 --> 13:52.999
Thanks for the tip.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.834
-Yeah, be safe tonight.
- Thanks, J.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.837
So, we'll go to the Blu Market & Café
and canvass for an hour.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.756
Get a location,
maybe that takes another hour…

13:59.839 --> 14:01.424
If the universe
doesn't want this to happen--

14:01.508 --> 14:03.677
Then the universe is gonna have to
change its mind.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.761
You don't get it.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.971
I-- I told you Brooke and I used to date,
right?

14:07.055 --> 14:09.140
She was this hotshot lawyer from the city,

14:09.224 --> 14:11.351
and I was this kid
from Cypress Beach, and…

14:11.976 --> 14:13.937
So, one night I took her
to this French place,

14:14.020 --> 14:17.899
and it wound up being
the most humiliating night of my life.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.526
-Do you know what tripe is?
-No.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.777
Yeah, neither did I.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.823
Anyway, we broke up at the end
of that summer, and I don't know,

14:24.906 --> 14:27.617
-I just always wanted another chance.
-Mmm.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.662
And now I ran into her,
and-- a-and we reconnected, and…

14:30.745 --> 14:32.706
You don't want to wipe out again.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.084
I feel you. But you can't force it.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.504
Now, I met Olivia on a joint op
with the Oakland PD.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.214
She was one of the patrol officers.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.508
On our first date,
we were at the Olive Garden.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.927
And I look into her eyes,

14:46.845 --> 14:50.140
and behind her I see this mugger
take this old lady's purse,

14:50.890 --> 14:51.933
and we both get up.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.561
It was poetry.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.731
This beautiful dance
as we chased this guy.

14:57.814 --> 15:02.444
And you know, even though it wasn't easy,
it was easy.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.362
You know what I mean?

15:04.946 --> 15:07.824
No. Two hours, 59 minutes.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.413
Fifty-three, your order's ready.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.710
Hi, I'm Laura Turner,
and I'm doing an investigation.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.671
Mind if I ask you some que--
No, that's lame.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.256
Mind if I ask you some questions?

15:23.340 --> 15:26.176
I'm Laura Turner, investigator.
Ugh, God. Come on. Come on--

15:26.259 --> 15:29.804
There's a line here.
-Oh, no. Not cutting, just investigating.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.640
Excuse me?

15:32.724 --> 15:35.101
Sorry. There's about a 30-minute wait.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.312
Laura freaking Turner!

15:37.395 --> 15:38.772
Amanda freaking Mitchell!

15:38.855 --> 15:39.939
-

15:40.023 --> 15:41.274
Hi.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.442
Wait, you work here?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.819
-Oh, I own the place.
-Oh, you own the place?

15:44.903 --> 15:46.946
I bought it from
the Merz sisters months ago.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.031
You never come in.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.532
I know. Mom life.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.243
Hi.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.829
Sharon Bingham? Serena Cho?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.832
My gosh, it's like a Cypress Beach High
reunion in here.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.167
Always.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.252
How are you, Laur?
Let's grab you a seat, yeah?

16:01.336 --> 16:02.462
Oh, my God. You're so sweet.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.673
I'm actually on a mission.
I was hoping you could help.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.049
-Do you have a second?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.551
-I have all the seconds.
-The phone? Do you need to get that?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.011
-I have all the seconds.
-Great.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.848
So, I know this is so random, but I need
to know about a guy, John Gillen,

16:13.932 --> 16:15.350
and I guess he orders from here.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.393
Oh, totally.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.603
-His receptionist comes in for his orders.
-Oh.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.397
Do you remember the girl
from second period,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.315
sophomore year, always wore tie-dye?

16:22.399 --> 16:24.317
She said her dad invented it?
Natalie something.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.694
-Natalie. It was Natalie…
-Something.

16:25.777 --> 16:29.572
-Natalie Leaman.
-Natalie Leaman! Thank you, Sharon.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.616
Okay, I just need to figure out
a way to find her.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.284
Oh, it's not a problem. Sit.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.995
We can Google-stalk Natalie
while you have some fries.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.873
-Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah.
-Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.875
-Okay. All right.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.423
You got your head on a swivel there.
Think Anderson might be around?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.217
-Nah, he's too smart for that.
- Ooh!

16:49.300 --> 16:52.429
Hey, hey, hey. Check out that bakery.
Look at those cakes.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.763
Instead of one big wedding cake,

16:53.847 --> 16:55.598
I was thinking of having
a lot of little cakes.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.350
You think this place could handle that?

16:57.434 --> 17:00.437
How would I know that?
Am I a wedding planner-- Gosh. Sorry.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.355
-Sorry about that.
- Ooh, what was that?

17:02.439 --> 17:03.815
Hooch, rude! Rude.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.608
God. This skunk has really spun him up.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.861
Also, why are we talking about
your wedding vendors?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.612
Okay? The clock is ticking here.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.115
Shouldn't we be trying to find
that Bluhouse Market & Café?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.117
We did. It's right here.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.913
Well, good. After you.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.373
Okay.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.422
-Welcome to the Bluhouse--

17:27.505 --> 17:28.423
- Oh!

17:28.506 --> 17:30.592
-Sorry! Sorry.
-Oh, boy.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.053
He's a little wound up.
He just got sprayed by a skunk.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.556
-Oh, my God. So sorry.

17:36.639 --> 17:40.060
You should try a tomato juice bath.
It gets the stink off.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.604
-Yeah, I just heard that.
-Ma'am, we're with the US Marshals.

17:42.687 --> 17:47.609
-We have a few questions.
-US Marshals. How exciting!

17:47.692 --> 17:50.236
We're looking for this man.
Leigh Anderson, who shopped here.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.782
Leigh. I know him, sure.
He in some kind of trouble?

17:53.865 --> 17:56.868
For now, we just need to find him.
Any idea where he might be?

17:56.951 --> 17:58.078
Friends? Associates?

17:58.161 --> 18:02.540
He comes in here once or twice a week.
Never talked about himself.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.126
I remember he spent some time
at Connie's Gallery.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.962
Maybe he's some kind of artist.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.881
The old art magazines at the house.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.094
-Okay. I'm so sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry.
-No, no.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.805
Hooch, come on.
I gotta take him outta here.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.683
No, no, no. Don't worry about the oranges.
I'll take care of them.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.227
-Okay.
-Um, Connie's Gallery?

18:22.310 --> 18:24.521
Connie's Gallery and Print Shop.
It's just down the road.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.190
Oh, um, before I go,
do you sell tomato juice?

18:27.273 --> 18:30.902
All out. Can't keep it on the shelf
in skunk season.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.742
-Good girl. Now bring it back. Catch.
-

18:37.826 --> 18:40.495
-

18:40.578 --> 18:42.664
Oh! Hello? Scott?

18:42.747 --> 18:45.750
Hi. I got a bit of a situation.
Wondering if you could help.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.502
Oh, a situation?

18:47.585 --> 18:50.672
Uh, depends on the situation,
but I love a situation.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.340
Uh… Yeah, it's Hooch.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.176
I'm out of town on a job,
and he's totally out of control.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.220
Jumping. Pulling.
He got sprayed by a skunk.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.180
-Sorry. Sorry.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.350
Oh, a skunk spray situation.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.686
Yeah. I mean,
he's just totally out of control.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.896
He's jumping up on counters.
He's running at people.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.356
I-I-I don't know what to do.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.235
He might just be excited by the smell.
I mean, that's a pretty powerful odor.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.112
Yeah. Yeah, it's powerful to everyone.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.031
I wish I could be more helpful.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.034
It's just-- It's hard to know
what's going on if we don't,

19:19.117 --> 19:20.744
you know, rule out the skunking.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.038
Maybe just give him a bath,
and if he's still acting up,

19:23.121 --> 19:24.706
we'll figure it out from there.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.583
All right, I'll try that. Thank you.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.876
No problem.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.506
Afternoon, folks.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.843
Your dog is welcome to come in,
by the way.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.096
Ah, trust me. You don't want him in here.
He just got sprayed by a skunk.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.432
Oh, poor thing.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.393
So, is there anything
I can help you with today?

19:45.477 --> 19:47.145
Yeah, actually, we're looking for, um…

19:48.396 --> 19:49.731
Are those wedding invitations?

19:49.814 --> 19:51.149
Why, yes, they are.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.276
We do all kinds of wedding printing here.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.404
Um, signs, name cards…
I design them all myself.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.656
It's cotton fiber. Nice density.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.910
That's actually the linen finish,
but I've got recycled cotton.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.328
Can you do the deckled edge?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.788
-Yep.
-You know what? Hey.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.457
Can we put a pin in
the wedding planning stuff for a second?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.334
Ma'am, we're with the US Marshals.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.919
Oh.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.881
Actually, we're looking for this man.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.342
Leigh Anderson. Have you seen him?

20:17.425 --> 20:18.468
Leigh.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.679
Yes, he came in.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.223
Think he said something about
being from out of town?

20:23.682 --> 20:27.018
-I would guess a big city.
-Big city. Why would you say that?

20:27.102 --> 20:30.897
He was a little snobby about the art.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.524
Which is crazy, right?

20:32.607 --> 20:35.568
I mean,
art is about bringing joy into the world.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.572
I'll go check on him.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.908
-You should try a tomato juice bath.
-Tomato juice bath.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.243
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

20:44.119 --> 20:47.122
-Um… Hmm. If you remember anything…
-Yep. Mm-hmm.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.251
Hey, um…

20:52.752 --> 20:53.795
Do you do portraits?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.340
I've always wanted to have
my engagement photo painted.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.092
-Sure.
-Yeah?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.469
If you can erase
all my dang parking tickets.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.804
I can't.

21:02.887 --> 21:03.972
Right.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.850
-All right.
-Mm-hmm. Yep, that's yours.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.185
Okay.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.151
Natalie? Natalie Leaman? It is!

21:16.234 --> 21:18.528
Hi! It's Laura.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.946
Laura Turner from high school.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.783
Oh. Right. How's it going?

21:23.867 --> 21:28.038
Good! Good. Wow, and it's so random
just bumping into you here.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.207
After 13 years? Yeah.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.001
I know.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.962
You know, I was just talking
to Amanda Mitchell at Hooked Fish Bar,

21:36.046 --> 21:39.090
and I was saying that
I was totally interested in real estate,

21:39.174 --> 21:42.135
and then she said that you work
at John Gillen's office.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.428
Wait.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.180
You had that conversation,

21:45.263 --> 21:48.433
and then you just happened to
walk by the place where I read every day?

21:48.933 --> 21:51.728
Yeah. Like I said, so random.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.773
Do you think you could
put me in touch with John?

21:54.856 --> 21:56.191
I'm just-- I'm such a huge fan.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.443
I think what he's doing
for mini-malls is so great.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.986
I mean, the American mall.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.948
You remember in high school…

22:04.032 --> 22:05.283
We'd skip last period,

22:05.367 --> 22:08.703
and we'd drive out to Sun Towers Mall
and get Orange Julius?

22:08.787 --> 22:12.707
No? I was never invited
to get Orange Juliuses.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.044
You know what we should do?
We should catch up.

22:16.127 --> 22:19.297
My son's at his dad's,
and I'm making tacos at my place tonight.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.299
I make a mean margarita.

22:22.634 --> 22:27.013
Laura Turner is inviting me over
for margaritas.

22:28.723 --> 22:29.724
Uh-huh.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.269
I guess I could go for a margarita.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.938
Yay!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.774
-Okay.
-Okay, bye!

22:37.857 --> 22:39.734
Um, I don't know where you live.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.784
If we go lights and sirens,
we could be back in 80 minutes.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.285
Something to think about.

22:51.496 --> 22:55.834
So, the Marin County Biker Club's in town,
and there are only two vacancies.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.628
Now, I figured, we canvass
until nightfall, and then in the morning--

22:58.712 --> 23:00.296
You seriously think
we gotta spend the night?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.799
We haven't caught the bad guy yet.
But I believe in us.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.093
Plus, we can scout the hotel
for the wedding.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.970
-Oh.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.973
Olivia's coming soon.
You should tell your prosecutor to come.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.476
Oh, yeah. X, tonight was supposed to be
our first date in years.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.980
You want me to ask her to drive two hours,
have a grilled cheese with my stinky dog?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.773
Kinda the opposite impression
I'm trying to make.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.817
I could call the chief,
see if he'll send someone else.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.778
"Hey, Chief. Mind if Scott bails
on the manhunt for a date?"

23:23.862 --> 23:25.739
Yeah, that'll go over great.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.450
No, you're right.
We gotta stay till we catch the guy.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.827
-You mind?
-Yeah.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.413
-Hooch.
-

23:33.496 --> 23:35.957
-

23:36.624 --> 23:38.460
Hello?
-Hey, Brooke. It's me.

23:38.543 --> 23:42.047
-Oh, hey, Scott. What's happening?
-You know, I have some not-so-great news.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.175
I'm so sorry to do this,
but I'm on a manhunt,

23:45.258 --> 23:47.385
and it looks like the guy we're after
is still in town,

23:47.469 --> 23:48.762
and I can't leave until we catch him.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.306
-So, I'm gonna have to cancel tonight.
-Cancel what?

23:52.557 --> 23:53.558
Our dinner?

23:53.641 --> 23:56.561
Oh, right. Ah, fantastique.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.979
I mean, not fantastique.

23:58.063 --> 24:01.191
Uh, but honestly, I'm buried today.
I would love to reschedule.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.153
Great! Yeah. Reschedule. Perfect. Perfect.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.279
Okay. Bye.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.408
She didn't even remember.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.203
Sounds like you two may not be riding
the same wave.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.455
I don't think
we're in the same ocean.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.833
Or is it all one ocean?

24:20.043 --> 24:22.462
Thank you for your never-ending
aquatic references.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.680
For you.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.600
Are those sour candies?

24:35.684 --> 24:38.311
Oh, yeah.
Leftover Halloween candy from my kid.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.021
"Muy authentico."

24:40.105 --> 24:41.481
Oh.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.733
So, tell me things.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.819
I mean, all I know is
that you're a receptionist.

24:45.902 --> 24:46.903
Do you love it?

24:47.487 --> 24:50.740
Do I love my job? As a r-- a receptionist?

24:51.449 --> 24:52.450
Yeah, fair point.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.619
Do you like your boss, at least?

24:54.703 --> 24:56.371
We don't talk much.

24:56.454 --> 25:01.042
Oh. 'Cause I know some people think
developers are kinda, like, bad people,

25:01.126 --> 25:03.586
but that's probably
just stereotype, right?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.422
-No. I work for a jerk.
-Mmm.

25:05.505 --> 25:09.342
Did you bring me here to remind me
that my life sucks right now?

25:09.426 --> 25:13.471
No. I'm sure you can handle your boss.
You seem tough.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.849
Maybe because people like you
made me tough.

25:16.808 --> 25:17.809
What do you mean?

25:17.892 --> 25:20.895
Like in high school,
when everyone was mean and made fun of me?

25:20.979 --> 25:22.188
But I never did that.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.815
You didn't stop them.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.692
Yeah.
-Whatev.

25:25.775 --> 25:29.070
I don't expect someone like you
to understand.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.030
Like me?

25:31.031 --> 25:32.824
I was nobody in high school, Laura.

25:32.907 --> 25:36.995
The kind of person that you,
in your white rhinestone jeans

25:37.078 --> 25:40.665
and perfect boyfriend Grady Garland,
didn't even notice.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.003
Oh, God. Those jeans.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.839
Also, Grady was not perfect.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.468
And we got divorced.
And that was awful for my kid and…

25:52.052 --> 25:53.428
It-- It doesn't matter.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.723
What matters is my friends
were mean to you.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.225
And I was mean for not stopping them.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.273
I should tell you.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.360
I lied to get you here.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.821
I just-- I really wanted to talk to you.

26:11.905 --> 26:15.075
Before my dad died,
he was investigating your boss.

26:15.158 --> 26:16.951
And now I'm investigating and…

26:17.702 --> 26:20.705
I was really excited,
and now I feel really bad.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.707
I wanna say I'm sorry.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.668
I'm sorry for what I did to you
in high school,

26:24.751 --> 26:26.836
and I'm sorry for lying to you right now.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.342
It's okay.

26:33.885 --> 26:36.346
It was a long time ago, and…

26:38.723 --> 26:40.058
the tacos are good.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.434
Thank you.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.604
So, are things better now, at least?

26:44.688 --> 26:47.691
I'd like to say yes,
but I'm back living in Cypress Beach.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.693
Back in Cypress Beach? You left?

26:49.776 --> 26:51.778
I lived in France for a while.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.698
Then a French underwear model guy used me
to get a green card.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.324
A French underwear model guy?

26:57.659 --> 27:00.662
You know, I have a really big bottle
of tequila and plenty of candy.

27:00.745 --> 27:01.621
Oh.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.415
-Continue.
-I'll start at the beginning.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.083
-His name was Jean.
-Of course it was.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.167
Jean Luc.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.588
I love it so much!

27:10.672 --> 27:11.673
My O!

27:11.756 --> 27:13.216
My X!

27:13.299 --> 27:15.969
Mmm.

27:17.012 --> 27:20.348
Hey. So, we got lucky.
The only two rooms left are suites.

27:20.432 --> 27:24.144
Yeah, $504 a night. Almost as much
as dinner at Le Majestique.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.479
-

27:26.563 --> 27:28.606
And you must be Hooch.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.192
-Wow. That is a powerful smell.
-Yeah.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.277
I'm Olivia.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.447
I know y'all are busy,
but you won't even notice me. I swear.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.200
Bless their hearts.
They've got fruit in the lobby water.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.327
-Mm-hmm.
- My mom will love this place.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.623
Give him a tomato juice bath.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.625
-I should.
-Okay.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.052
Mmm. I didn't even know
there was a Disneyland Paris.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.803
So, that's where you met your ex?

27:58.887 --> 28:01.848
-No. We met on safari in Tanzania.
-Oh.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.476
He was French Nigerian
and was traveling with his family,

28:04.559 --> 28:06.895
who turned out to be royalty and crazy.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.439
Ha! So, then you came back
to Cypress Beach

28:09.522 --> 28:13.443
-to get your real estate license?
-I'm taking the test in two weeks.

28:13.526 --> 28:17.655
I have been trying to get it together
to take my vet tech exam for years.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.907
Your life is amazing.

28:18.990 --> 28:23.078
Can't believe the guacamole princess
is calling my life amazing.

28:23.161 --> 28:26.831
Yeah, well, this guacamole princess
has never left the country.

28:26.915 --> 28:30.043
She definitely didn't expect to be
divorced by 27

28:30.126 --> 28:33.755
or still be a vet assistant at 30
or be boring.

28:35.006 --> 28:40.011
Well, she is investigating a mystery.
That's not boring.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.180
To new projects and new lives.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.182
Yeah. And to new friends maybe?

28:44.265 --> 28:45.517
And new friends.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.019
-Yeah.
-

28:49.396 --> 28:50.480
Hey, you like karaoke?

28:50.563 --> 28:53.358
I love karaoke.
I love it so much.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.489
Thanks.

29:58.757 --> 30:00.050
Whoo!

30:28.536 --> 30:30.205
-

30:34.584 --> 30:38.254
-

30:43.176 --> 30:44.427
Did I change my alarm?

30:45.804 --> 30:47.806
-

30:47.889 --> 30:49.224
I see you judging me.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.395
Yep.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.531
Wow.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.121
Hey, Laura.
- Hey, Scott.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.831
I think I found a way to get to Gillen.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.667
Laura, I-- I can't really talk right now.
I'm on a job.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.086
No. I think that I just cracked the case.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.880
Do you think you can make it
back to CB ASAP?

31:20.964 --> 31:22.924
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.718
-Okay, I gotta go.
-No, I really--

31:24.801 --> 31:26.386
-Scott?

31:26.469 --> 31:28.888
-Hey.
-Good news. They got little cakes.

31:29.889 --> 31:30.932
Ooh.

31:31.016 --> 31:33.977
I thought you gave Hooch a bath.
He…  …still smells.

31:34.060 --> 31:37.605
Yeah. I did. A $517 tomato juice bath.

31:37.689 --> 31:40.150
Turns out, Hooch hates tomatoes.
It was everywhere.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.609
It looked like The Shining in there.

31:41.693 --> 31:42.944
I don't like scary movies.

31:43.528 --> 31:44.529
Okay.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.365
Hooch, don't eat anyone.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.285
-You tracked down Leigh yet?
-Uh, we're working on it.

31:50.368 --> 31:53.705
-Well, good luck. Enjoy the coffee.
-

31:57.208 --> 31:58.543
Look at my O.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.086
Isn't she perfection?

32:00.879 --> 32:03.715
Yeah. She's very nice and normal.

32:06.343 --> 32:08.470
-Why wouldn't she be normal?
-No reason.

32:08.553 --> 32:09.554
Look, no offense,

32:09.637 --> 32:12.182
but the romantic talk's
just a little hard to take right now.

32:12.265 --> 32:15.101
I just missed a date I've been thinking
about for half a decade.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.688
Yeah, well, it's not about one date.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.232
When love is right,
the universe will let you know.

32:21.316 --> 32:24.027
Oh, well then, I'm pretty sure
the universe hates me right now.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.445
-Check this out.

32:25.528 --> 32:29.074
Yo. I literally just asked you
to cool out on the true love photos.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.242
No, it's not a photo. Message from Jess.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.078
Cell tower picked up Anderson's phone.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.454
-He's still here.
-Really?

32:37.123 --> 32:38.625
-

32:40.752 --> 32:41.795
This dog.

32:43.171 --> 32:44.214
I'm so sorry.

32:44.297 --> 32:47.175
Your dog seems to have attacked
the tip jar.

32:47.258 --> 32:48.677
Hooch, no, no, no. No.

32:49.219 --> 32:52.138
-I'm sorry. Hooch, give it to me.
-

32:52.222 --> 32:54.891
Why are you so determined
to eat this bill? Give it.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.559
Ugh.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.061
-Sorry.
-

32:58.144 --> 32:59.145
Wait.

33:00.897 --> 33:03.692
Where did this come from?
Who put this 20 in the jar?

33:03.775 --> 33:07.946
I did. We stick 20s in to remind folks
tips come in all sizes.

33:09.364 --> 33:13.660
You see this, Cookie?
Sometimes these are full of explosives.

33:13.743 --> 33:17.372
Now you're gonna sniff the bag
and find the explosives. Ready?

33:17.455 --> 33:20.625
No. Not a bed, Cookie. Not a…

33:22.335 --> 33:24.504
Okay, it's a bed just this once.

33:24.587 --> 33:25.672
Hey, Scott.

33:25.755 --> 33:28.550
Hooch still freaking out?
-Sorry. No, no, no. Well, yes.

33:28.633 --> 33:30.176
I tied him up outside this café, right?

33:30.260 --> 33:31.928
He ran inside,
went straight for the tip jar,

33:32.012 --> 33:33.555
and he started playing in the money.

33:33.638 --> 33:35.265
Look, I don't think it was the skunk.

33:35.348 --> 33:37.934
I think it's the money in this town
that's driving Hooch nuts.

33:38.018 --> 33:41.438
I don't know. If there was a drug residue
on the bills or something?

33:41.521 --> 33:45.984
Well, I doubt that because there's
pretty much drug residue on all bills.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.862
Well, then what could it be?
-Wait a minute.

33:48.945 --> 33:50.155
Could it be counterfeit?

33:50.238 --> 33:53.116
The chemicals on counterfeit bills,
they smell really weird.

33:53.199 --> 33:56.077
And Secret Service sometimes uses dogs
to find fake bills.

33:56.161 --> 33:58.121
You're amazing. Thank you.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.331
-Thank you.
-You know, it's nothing.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.251
He already hung up.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.003
But he said I was amazing.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.755
I mean, he said I was amazing.

34:06.838 --> 34:07.881
The bills are counterfeit.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.758
Makes sense. Leigh was an artist.

34:09.841 --> 34:11.509
He probably hung around town
to print more money.

34:11.593 --> 34:13.636
-And if he's printing more cash…
-The gallery.

34:13.720 --> 34:14.804
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.139
-Come on.
-

34:17.932 --> 34:19.517
Oh, hi.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.936
Welcome back.

34:22.020 --> 34:24.773
-Um, we're closing for lunch.
- I just need a sec.

34:24.856 --> 34:28.109
I showed the invitations to my fiancée,
and she loved it.

34:28.193 --> 34:31.696
Right. The woodland pattern.
I can ring it up after lunch.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.617
Just one question.
Do you do the printing yourself?

34:35.700 --> 34:38.244
I do it all myself. Just me.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.330
Perfect. I would love to see the printer.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.708
I-- The… The printer's broken today.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.920
That's fine. I need to see it anyway.
Just to make sure it's eco-friendly.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.841
Just let me tidy up.

34:51.925 --> 34:53.927
Stop right there. No!

34:54.010 --> 34:56.805
We've gotta get out of here!
- What's going on?

34:56.888 --> 34:58.390
The cops are here! Go!

34:58.473 --> 35:00.308
Ready? One, two, three.

35:05.563 --> 35:07.774
- That's them. Let's go.

35:07.857 --> 35:10.402
Give me the keys. The way you drive,
we're never gonna catch 'em.

35:20.745 --> 35:22.580
Go, go, go!

35:28.712 --> 35:31.006
X, baby, this is heaven.

35:31.089 --> 35:33.216
O, hey-- Do you got your gun on you?

35:33.299 --> 35:34.676
What's going on? Are you in trouble?

35:34.759 --> 35:37.721
We're chasing two suspects, headed east,
and we don't have a visual.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.556
I'm guessing they're headed
to the municipal airport.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.891
-We need backup.
-On my way. I need my feet.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.436
Namaste.

35:47.272 --> 35:49.774
See them?
-I can't see anything, Connie.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.943
Are you even looking?
You have to look.

35:52.027 --> 35:54.446
Maybe if you had a normal car
with a back window,

35:54.529 --> 35:58.366
instead of a van filled with garbage
and canvases, I could!

35:58.450 --> 36:01.619
The cleanliness of my van is now
a priority when the feds are after us.

36:01.703 --> 36:04.414
As if that has ever been a priority,
Connie.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.916
Oh, my God. With the judging.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.501
It's, like, all you can do.

36:08.585 --> 36:11.296
Am I insane? What am I even doing
running off to Mexico with you?

36:11.379 --> 36:12.964
I was perfectly happy in El Dorado,

36:13.048 --> 36:16.384
forging bank records for the drug cartel
and selling my art.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.511
You call that art, do you?

36:25.352 --> 36:26.895
Hey! You with the tattoo!

36:27.687 --> 36:28.730
I need some help.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.024
I don't see him anywhere.

36:31.107 --> 36:32.734
How'd you know
there was an airport out here?

36:32.817 --> 36:35.362
From scouting for the wedding.
Olivia's got cousins in Chicago.

36:35.445 --> 36:36.988
Seriously? Scouting for the wedding?

36:37.072 --> 36:39.115
-Over there. By the hangar!
-Got it.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.543
-Come on, boy.

36:54.756 --> 36:55.799
One, two…

36:57.133 --> 36:58.468
They're here!

37:00.345 --> 37:01.388
-X!

37:03.723 --> 37:05.100
I think I got one!

37:06.017 --> 37:08.395
X! X, talk to me. Are you all right?

37:08.478 --> 37:11.272
-Move faster! What's wrong with you?
- It's heavy.

37:11.356 --> 37:13.358
Get it in the plane.
We gotta get out of here.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.443
-Where are you hit? You all right?
-

37:21.741 --> 37:23.368
So that's what that feels like.

37:23.451 --> 37:24.911
-Bulletproof vest, huh?
-

37:25.537 --> 37:26.955
-Hey!

37:27.038 --> 37:27.997
What's going on?

37:28.081 --> 37:31.167
There's a dog!
It's trying to get the money!

37:31.251 --> 37:33.461
-Well, stop it then!
-

37:33.545 --> 37:35.839
Hooch? Hooch!

37:35.922 --> 37:37.882
Can't we just go? This is crazy!

37:37.966 --> 37:40.844
No. Crazy would be going to Mexico
with a dead broke idiot

37:40.927 --> 37:42.595
who can't even appreciate fine art!

37:43.304 --> 37:44.848
Connie! Connie!

37:46.182 --> 37:47.308
-Hey!
-To hell with it.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.519
Hey! Connie!

37:49.602 --> 37:52.522
Connie! Connie!

37:53.523 --> 37:55.150
-US Marshal!
-On the ground!

37:55.233 --> 37:56.985
Get on the ground now!

37:59.946 --> 38:01.865
Hey! Hey! Don't move that plane!

38:02.490 --> 38:04.200
Go get her! I got this! Go!

38:23.053 --> 38:24.971
Out of the plane!
Hands where I can see 'em!

38:25.055 --> 38:26.973
-Slowly. Slowly.
-Your hands!

38:27.057 --> 38:29.059
Don't-- D-D-Don't sh--

38:29.142 --> 38:30.352
Who the hell are you?

38:30.935 --> 38:32.604
That's my girl.

38:32.687 --> 38:34.397
And I'm gonna marry her in three months…

38:34.481 --> 38:35.899
Two weeks and three days.

38:37.609 --> 38:40.904
When love is right,
the universe lets you know.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.072
I love you.

38:42.864 --> 38:44.115
Ew.

38:49.746 --> 38:52.832
No, no, no. Outside.
I'm sorry. I can't. It's--

38:52.916 --> 38:55.794
-Yeah, honestly, I can't smell it anymore.
-That's sad, Turner.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.838
You guys caught a big tuna this week.

38:58.922 --> 39:00.256
Got a call from the Secret Service.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.550
They've been after
Leigh's operation for months.

39:02.634 --> 39:03.885
They sent this.

39:04.469 --> 39:06.930
Heard you took a bullet to the vest.
How's that hit feeling?

39:07.013 --> 39:10.558
Like a bittersweet reminder
of the fleeting nature of existence.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.019
Okay. Well, good job.

39:13.103 --> 39:17.190
-So, is this you two teaming up now?
-I think we may walk the same path.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.317
Yeah. Could be.

39:20.026 --> 39:21.403
Didn't see that coming.

39:21.486 --> 39:24.114
Uh, anyway, great job.
Get that dog outta here.

39:25.156 --> 39:26.616
The healing power of melons.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.951
-Turner.
-Yo.

39:28.034 --> 39:30.620
Have you tried tomato juice on Hooch?
Heard it works wonders.

39:30.704 --> 39:32.789
-Thanks for the tip, Chief.
-

39:36.584 --> 39:38.795
Thank you so much
for meeting me here so quickly.

39:38.878 --> 39:39.963
I know that you're busy,

39:40.046 --> 39:42.340
and I'm sure you wanted to wash Hooch
before you came.

39:42.424 --> 39:43.925
Everything smells the same now.

39:44.009 --> 39:46.720
So, how'd you get this Gillen guy
to agree to meet with us?

39:46.803 --> 39:48.388
I thought you said
he was totally off the grid.

39:48.471 --> 39:49.931
That was before Natalie Leaman.

39:50.015 --> 39:52.934
Remember, from high school?
Told everyone her dad invented tie-dye?

39:53.018 --> 39:54.019
That rings a bell.

39:54.102 --> 39:56.604
Yeah. Turns out,
her dad did kind of invent tie-dye.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.149
-Hmm.
-I found out she's Gillen's receptionist,

39:59.232 --> 40:00.567
and we totally reconnected.

40:00.650 --> 40:04.279
I guess he was hiding at his lake house?
Oh. Oh, God. They're here.

40:07.699 --> 40:10.076
Mr. Gillen. I'm Scott Turner.
This is my sister, Laura--

40:10.160 --> 40:12.245
Yeah, look. Here's the deal.
I don't wanna be here.

40:12.328 --> 40:15.165
But I don't need the feds after me either,
so let's just clear this up.

40:15.248 --> 40:17.125
-What do you wanna know?
-Have a seat.

40:22.547 --> 40:25.050
Our father was investigating you. Why?

40:26.676 --> 40:27.677
You don't mind, do you?

40:28.261 --> 40:29.304
-No.
- She does.

40:33.308 --> 40:34.476
Simple version?

40:34.559 --> 40:37.312
Your dad thought my mini-malls
were ruining Cypress Beach.

40:37.395 --> 40:39.356
I thought he was an old fart
stuck in the past.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.232
-That's pretty much it.
-That right?

40:42.067 --> 40:45.945
We spoke to a guy named Wyatt Tolliver.
Said he did some work for you?

40:47.697 --> 40:50.367
All right. So I scared off
a couple of losers

40:50.450 --> 40:52.118
to get a better deal on some properties.

40:52.202 --> 40:54.913
Hey, don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

40:54.996 --> 40:56.915
That particular "game"
is actually called extortion.

40:56.998 --> 40:57.999
It's a federal crime.

41:00.043 --> 41:02.671
All right. All right.
Did I cut some corners?

41:02.754 --> 41:05.674
And your dad got pissed about it? Yeah.

41:05.757 --> 41:07.884
But you guys are on the wrong track here,
all right?

41:07.967 --> 41:09.928
Then why did you run? Why were you hiding?

41:10.011 --> 41:12.514
Wyatt freaked out
after you guys talked to him.

41:12.597 --> 41:14.974
Told everyone that you were investigating
some big crime.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.726
Next thing I know, the guy disappears?

41:16.810 --> 41:21.272
Then I start seeing this creepy-looking
station wagon parked in front of my house?

41:21.356 --> 41:23.942
I ran because I didn't wanna be next.

41:25.235 --> 41:28.238
I-- All right, look. I don't know
what your dad was investigating,

41:28.321 --> 41:31.658
It was a lot bigger than me.

41:31.741 --> 41:33.243
All right? He told me so himself.

41:33.868 --> 41:37.080
He said he was gonna drop the case.
Had bigger fish to fry.

41:37.163 --> 41:38.707
Bigger fish? What does that mean?

41:38.790 --> 41:41.167
I don't know, but that's what he said
last time I spoke to him.

41:41.251 --> 41:44.504
So, you know what? Unless you're
gonna arrest me, I'm leaving.

41:48.675 --> 41:51.011
Oh, uh, by the way,

41:51.094 --> 41:54.639
my mom was one of the "losers"
who sold you her house.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.475
Find a new receptionist,
'cause, uh, I quit.

41:59.144 --> 42:00.145
Great.

42:03.398 --> 42:04.941
I wanted to do that for a long time.

42:05.025 --> 42:06.401
-

42:06.484 --> 42:09.529
I'll get the check. I still have
the company credit card.

42:13.825 --> 42:17.162
That was amazing. Hooch, that was amazing.
I felt like I was in a movie.

42:17.662 --> 42:19.289
Who do you think "bigger fish" means?

42:19.372 --> 42:20.790
I don't know.

42:21.458 --> 42:24.961
I like Detective Laura though.
You did good. You got us a lead.

42:26.129 --> 42:30.216
Honestly, I have not been this fired up
about anything in a long time.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.718
I mean, I just-- I--

42:32.302 --> 42:35.722
I love Matthew,
and I love my animals, but me-wise?

42:36.389 --> 42:37.932
You know, Natalie made me think.

42:38.683 --> 42:41.061
I don't wanna look back on my life
and say,

42:41.144 --> 42:42.896
"Man, I didn't do stuff," you know?

42:44.647 --> 42:48.109
Well, all I know is when you do stuff,
you're good at it.

42:49.069 --> 42:50.528
Aw, Scott.

42:52.906 --> 42:54.699
All right, let's go. The dog stinks.

42:54.783 --> 42:56.493
-Okay.
-I mean, it's bad.

42:58.495 --> 43:01.998
Mmm. Oh, my God. This is so good.

43:02.082 --> 43:05.543
I mean, what is in this?
This is like all things I ever wanna eat.

43:05.627 --> 43:09.464
It's chicken, rice, peas, cheese

43:09.547 --> 43:12.634
and secret ingredient, panko crumbs.

43:13.218 --> 43:16.304
The dogs just love it,
and Angel and I thought,

43:16.388 --> 43:18.473
since the baby's on the way,
that you wouldn't wanna cook.

43:18.556 --> 43:20.183
So, we just made extra.

43:20.266 --> 43:21.685
-So sweet.
-Mm-hmm.

43:21.768 --> 43:25.897
How are you doing with the whole baby
inside your body?

43:25.980 --> 43:29.818
Yes. Um, well, the new thing is
I now pee when I sneeze.

43:29.901 --> 43:32.904
-Oh.
-But Darius always brings me fresh pants.

43:32.987 --> 43:33.988
That's love right there.

43:34.072 --> 43:37.200
Speaking of love,
we gotta find you a somebody, E.

43:37.283 --> 43:38.284
Mm-hmm.

43:38.368 --> 43:40.787
Me, like a human man somebody?

43:40.870 --> 43:42.580
Yeah. Somebody like Scott.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.667
Why would you think that?
I never said I liked Scott.

43:46.292 --> 43:48.545
-Did you…
-Ooh. Mm-mmm.

43:48.628 --> 43:50.547
No. Darius brought it up.

43:50.630 --> 43:54.634
He just said he thought you and Scott
made a cute couple, like, out of the blue.

43:54.718 --> 43:55.969
Out of the blue.

43:56.052 --> 43:59.889
But if you were interested,
hypothetically, the timing isn't bad,

43:59.973 --> 44:03.268
'cause I just happen to know
Scott got stuck on an assignment,

44:03.351 --> 44:04.728
and his big date fell through.

44:04.811 --> 44:07.313
He had a date? Oh, it was with… Brooke.

44:07.397 --> 44:08.815
Don't you mean Prosecutor Barbie?

44:08.898 --> 44:10.775
-

44:10.859 --> 44:11.860
She is really pretty.

44:11.943 --> 44:14.571
If you like that J. Crew kinda thing.
If that's your vibe.

44:15.155 --> 44:16.781
Hundred bucks she owns golf clubs.

44:16.865 --> 44:18.241
-Oh, yeah.

44:18.324 --> 44:20.368
-No. She owns golf clubs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:20.452 --> 44:21.911
I say make a move.

44:21.995 --> 44:25.290
Like with this lady right here,
one date and I knew.

44:25.957 --> 44:28.918
As soon as I got in my car,
I called her for a second one.

44:29.002 --> 44:32.172
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, he did. He did.
-And it worked?

44:32.255 --> 44:34.215
-Yeah.

44:34.299 --> 44:36.926
You know what?
Show up to his place with flowers.

44:37.510 --> 44:38.678
Heck! Do it tonight.

44:38.762 --> 44:41.473
No, no, no. No.
You want him to think she's crazy?

44:41.556 --> 44:45.352
It's the 21st century, babe.
A woman can buy a dude flowers.

44:45.435 --> 44:47.145
And I know a great flower shop.

44:47.228 --> 44:49.064
No. Do not get him flowers.

44:49.147 --> 44:50.148
-It's too soon.
-No?

44:50.231 --> 44:52.776
Roses. Trust me.
- Roses.

44:52.859 --> 44:54.194
Roses.

44:58.531 --> 45:00.033
This is how it's gonna happen.

45:00.575 --> 45:04.120
We're gonna go in the bath, all right?
We're not doing it like last time, right?

45:04.204 --> 45:05.580
-

45:05.663 --> 45:07.248
Mrs. Mandelbaum.

45:08.416 --> 45:10.001
Ugh. Come on.

45:10.543 --> 45:12.879
Mrs. Mandelbaum needs to chill, Hooch.

45:12.962 --> 45:15.090
Mrs. Mandelbaum, there's a dog in my--

45:16.841 --> 45:17.926
-Hi.
-Hi.

45:18.009 --> 45:21.054
-Nice, um… outfit.
-

45:22.305 --> 45:24.099
-Hey, Hooch.
-

45:24.182 --> 45:26.434
Oof. Did he get skunked?

45:26.518 --> 45:27.602
-Yeah. He did.
-Wow!

45:27.686 --> 45:29.896
Yeah, I'm actually just giving him a bath.

45:29.979 --> 45:34.651
I just-- I wanted to apologize
for forgetting about dinner.

45:34.734 --> 45:36.778
I googled the place, and it looks amazing,

45:36.861 --> 45:38.655
and I was driving by your house,
so I just…

45:38.738 --> 45:42.450
Wow. I-- That's great.
I wish I wasn't in the middle of--

45:42.534 --> 45:44.452
Do you need help with the bath?

45:45.412 --> 45:46.413
Sure.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.082
Okay. Let's do this.

45:53.712 --> 45:56.506
- I'm so sorry.

45:57.674 --> 45:59.634
-I'm not.
-That's-- That's so much.

45:59.718 --> 46:01.386
I didn't mean to.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.222
-Oh, my gosh.
-

46:04.931 --> 46:06.016
Thank you.

46:11.604 --> 46:13.815
-
