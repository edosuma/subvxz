01:21.916 --> 01:23.081
Here's your shit.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.349
Can't we talk about this?

01:24.351 --> 01:25.717
Talk about what?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.018
The fact that you're a loser

01:27.020 --> 01:29.221
and you're always
going to be a loser?

01:29.223 --> 01:30.757
Well, we could do that,

01:30.759 --> 01:32.725
but I don't wanna make the
conversation all about me.

01:32.727 --> 01:35.261
Everything is
always a joke to you.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.130
Can't you take anything serious?

01:37.132 --> 01:39.766
I'm serious about
us, about you.

01:39.768 --> 01:41.503
Doesn't that count?

01:42.028 --> 01:44.505
Come on, let's go back
inside and talk about this.

01:44.507 --> 01:46.874
When we met, you told
me you were a chef.

01:46.876 --> 01:48.441
I thought you were going places.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.244
Come to find out, you live
at home with your parents

01:50.246 --> 01:51.678
and you don't even have a job.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.747
Well, I can get
a job if I want to.

01:53.749 --> 01:56.117
I'm just waiting
for the right one.

01:56.119 --> 01:58.453
Wait, is this what
this is all about?

01:58.455 --> 01:59.754
That's what'll make you happy?

01:59.756 --> 02:02.156
Oh my god, I will go out
and get a job right now.

02:02.158 --> 02:05.659
Face it, Barnaby, you're
never going to change.

02:05.661 --> 02:07.263
You're always going to be a bum

02:07.265 --> 02:09.098
who lives at home
with mom and dad,

02:09.100 --> 02:11.533
and I'm not going to waste
another second of my life

02:11.535 --> 02:14.135
in a relationship
with a failed cook.

02:14.137 --> 02:16.205
You take that back.

02:16.207 --> 02:17.206
I'm a chef.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.809
No, you're a cook.

02:19.811 --> 02:21.177
Do you even know
what the difference

02:21.179 --> 02:22.814
between a chef and a cook is?

02:23.681 --> 02:24.613
'Cause I'm pretty sure a cook

02:24.615 --> 02:25.648
wouldn't have a culinary degree.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.452
Goodbye Barnaby.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.486
And I'm pretty sure a cook

02:29.488 --> 02:31.822
wouldn't have a
badass set of knives.

02:31.824 --> 02:33.256
Well, maybe he would,

02:33.258 --> 02:36.094
but he wouldn't have a badass
set of knives like this.

02:36.096 --> 02:38.328
Where are my knives?

02:38.330 --> 02:39.930
Ah!

02:39.932 --> 02:42.036
What, are you psycho?

02:42.902 --> 02:45.004
Who throws knives at people?

02:45.006 --> 02:47.972
What if one of 'em had come
out and hit me in the face?

02:47.974 --> 02:49.607
You know what, I'm
glad we're breaking up

02:49.609 --> 02:51.911
'cause you're obviously crazy.

02:54.116 --> 02:57.650
I'm sorry babe, I
didn't mean that.

02:57.652 --> 02:59.719
You're not crazy.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.791
Maybe just a little, but
that's why I love you.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.193
Really?

03:07.195 --> 03:09.330
You're not gonna give me
back my autographed football?

03:09.332 --> 03:10.366
Do you have any idea how long

03:11.534 --> 03:13.169
it took me to forge
those signatures?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.169
Oh!

03:15.171 --> 03:18.807
Would you stop throwing
stuff at my face?

03:18.809 --> 03:21.210
And don't bother calling.

03:21.945 --> 03:23.745
I'm changing my number.

03:23.747 --> 03:25.315
And one more thing,

03:26.183 --> 03:30.155
I've always hated your cooking.

04:10.431 --> 04:12.398
Dear Barnaby, your
father and I have decided

04:12.400 --> 04:14.432
it's time for you to do
something with your life.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.673
Is this some kind of a joke?

04:20.442 --> 04:22.142
Come on, Dad, I
know you're home.

04:22.144 --> 04:24.913
I can see you
through the window.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.616
Oh, no, oh!

08:28.910 --> 08:32.178
Hey, old man,
wanna play a game of pig?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
Are you talkin' to me?

08:34.082 --> 08:37.082
I don't see any other senior
citizens playing basketball.

08:37.085 --> 08:38.318
Do you?

08:38.320 --> 08:39.854
Are you sure you
can play basketball?

08:39.856 --> 08:42.557
I don't what you dyin' on
me from a heart attack.

08:42.558 --> 08:44.793
And I don't want you to fall
over and dislocate your hip.

08:44.795 --> 08:46.830
Ooh, good one.

08:47.998 --> 08:49.264
Haven't heard that
a million times.

08:49.266 --> 08:50.766
Well, I don't want
ya to take a break

08:50.768 --> 08:53.034
midway through the game
and go get a cheeseburger.

08:53.036 --> 08:54.737
And I don't want you to
cheat while we're playing

08:54.739 --> 08:56.939
and fart dust in my eyes.

08:56.941 --> 08:59.709
This is gettin' old,
are we gonna play or not?

08:59.711 --> 09:02.113
Fine, but I get ball first.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.551
Before I sink this, 20
bucks says I beat you.

09:07.553 --> 09:10.320
Fine, you wanna
bet on the game?

09:10.322 --> 09:11.788
Let's make it 40 then.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.223
Fine with me.

09:13.225 --> 09:14.524
You got 40 bucks on ya?

09:14.526 --> 09:16.359
Sure do, do you?

09:16.361 --> 09:17.460
Of course I do.

09:17.462 --> 09:19.464
What do I look like, a kid?

09:19.466 --> 09:21.566
All right then, game on.

09:23.469 --> 09:25.338
Aw, that's too bad.

09:34.181 --> 09:38.752
♪ Someone's got a P ♪

09:44.091 --> 09:46.828
Check it out kid,
my eyes closed.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.407
Easy shot.

10:04.847 --> 10:07.617
Look who else has a P.

10:17.227 --> 10:18.995
Looks like we're all tied up.

10:18.997 --> 10:20.429
So?

10:20.431 --> 10:22.700
We both know you're gonna
miss this next shot.

10:28.473 --> 10:32.842
What was that about me
missin' the next shot?

10:32.844 --> 10:35.614
Don't tell me you're nervous.

10:43.724 --> 10:45.725
That's 40 bucks, pay up.

10:50.464 --> 10:51.465
20...

10:52.566 --> 10:53.399
40.

10:55.904 --> 10:59.070
Nice doin' business
with ya, old timer.

10:59.072 --> 11:02.474
Whatever, just don't
spend it all on one meal.

11:02.476 --> 11:04.709
Buy some vegetables.

11:43.321 --> 11:45.955
Things just keep
gettin' better and better.

12:03.543 --> 12:04.644
One.

12:05.244 --> 12:07.244
Two, three.

12:08.214 --> 12:09.947
13, 14.

12:12.118 --> 12:13.818
$15.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.221
I'm so hungry.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.402
I'll bet they'll
have food there.

13:42.183 --> 13:43.017
Barnaby?

13:44.119 --> 13:45.551
Barnaby, is that you?

13:47.054 --> 13:48.988
Actually, it's Arnie.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.223
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,

13:50.225 --> 13:51.357
are you livin' out of your car?

13:51.359 --> 13:52.791
Why would you think that?

13:52.793 --> 13:54.994
Dude, aw dude,
no, check this out.

13:54.996 --> 13:56.796
He's livin' out of his car.

13:56.798 --> 14:00.468
It's Arnie, and I never said
I was living out of my car.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.335
Damn
bro, what happened?

14:02.337 --> 14:03.803
It's none of your business.

14:03.805 --> 14:06.674
Well look, Noah and I are
insurance brokers downtown now.

14:06.676 --> 14:09.744
Yeah, nothin' too fancy
though, corner office.

14:09.746 --> 14:10.979
Six-figure salary.

14:10.981 --> 14:13.615
We get to go home
to an actual home.

14:13.617 --> 14:16.283
But hey, you know what,
Barnaby, you're livin' the life.

14:16.285 --> 14:19.154
Yeah, no commitments,
nothin' to tie ya down.

14:19.156 --> 14:20.622
And at least you
get to travel, right?

14:22.526 --> 14:23.860
Really, six figures?

14:23.862 --> 14:25.962
Yeah man, six figures.

14:25.964 --> 14:28.530
Just so you know, when
people make six figures,

14:28.532 --> 14:31.568
they don't count the
numbers after the decimal,

14:31.570 --> 14:34.838
and insurance brokers,
wow, I'm impressed.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.942
So what, they had
like an internship

14:38.944 --> 14:40.410
for special ed graduates

14:40.412 --> 14:43.381
or did they wanna diversify
the sexual orientation,

14:43.383 --> 14:45.650
so they hired your two homos?

14:45.652 --> 14:46.651
Hey, hey, hey.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.852
Relax man, he's not worth it.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.720
We're not gay.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.256
When you're ready
to tie the knot,

14:51.258 --> 14:53.191
I know the perfect
wedding planner.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.493
No, screw you.

14:54.495 --> 14:57.028
I appreciate the
offer, but no thanks.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.098
You know what, enjoy
sleepin' in your car tonight,

14:59.100 --> 15:01.068
Barnaby.

15:06.141 --> 15:07.640
Hey Gisele, does Tom Brady

15:07.642 --> 15:10.744
know you're cheatin' on
him with Forest Whitaker?

15:24.661 --> 15:26.762
Arnie, is that you?

15:28.864 --> 15:29.897
Madison?

15:31.234 --> 15:33.135
How have you been?

15:33.137 --> 15:34.803
Did you just get here?

15:34.805 --> 15:36.804
Actually, I was just leaving.

15:36.806 --> 15:37.872
Oh, me too.

15:37.874 --> 15:40.342
Really, didn't it just start.

15:40.344 --> 15:43.713
Yeah, but I wasn't
really feeling the DJ, so.

15:43.715 --> 15:46.685
Yeah, me too, he was terrible.

15:48.086 --> 15:50.152
It was actually a woman DJ.

15:50.154 --> 15:52.555
Wait, did you not go inside?

15:52.557 --> 15:54.892
No, well, I was going to,

15:54.894 --> 15:57.260
but then I ran into
Noah and Chris,

15:57.262 --> 15:59.128
and I forgot that they
have crushes on me,

15:59.130 --> 16:01.098
so I didn't want to
awkwardly deal with them

16:01.100 --> 16:02.999
making passes at me all night.

16:03.001 --> 16:05.271
Yeah, that makes sense.

16:06.806 --> 16:10.774
Oh, I'm in the process
of moving right now.

16:10.776 --> 16:12.210
Okay, yeah.

16:12.212 --> 16:15.746
Yeah, my last two
roommates were real dicks.

16:15.748 --> 16:18.150
Plus, you know, they're old

16:18.152 --> 16:20.752
and they were always
tellin' me what to do.

16:20.754 --> 16:22.188
You know, besides, I
thought my girlfriend

16:22.190 --> 16:24.959
would take me more seriously
if I lived on my own.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.528
Y-you have a girlfriend?

16:29.697 --> 16:33.668
Well, I had one,
but I feel that

16:34.869 --> 16:36.936
we'll get back together
once I get my own place.

16:36.938 --> 16:38.406
Oh, I see.

16:39.807 --> 16:42.810
Well, I-I hope it works
out between the two of you.

16:42.812 --> 16:44.811
Yeah, I hope so too.

16:44.813 --> 16:46.613
Well, uh, I have to get going,

16:46.615 --> 16:50.151
but maybe we can chat some
more over coffee sometime?

16:50.153 --> 16:51.853
Yeah, that-that'd be great.

16:51.855 --> 16:52.956
Okay.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.860
Oh, I'm on Facebook.

16:58.862 --> 17:01.529
Oh, I actually
don't have Facebook.

17:01.531 --> 17:03.032
What, why?

17:03.034 --> 17:05.601
Uh, I was always getting
friend requests from weirdos

17:05.603 --> 17:07.303
and like people poking me

17:07.305 --> 17:11.006
and that porn that was
popping up on my timeline.

17:11.008 --> 17:12.508
I know, right?

17:12.510 --> 17:15.645
It's like, what, this hot
chick wants to be my friend,

17:15.646 --> 17:17.080
and then you click
on her profile

17:17.083 --> 17:19.316
and you see her account
was made yesterday,

17:19.318 --> 17:22.085
and the porn, it's
like, whoa bro,

17:22.087 --> 17:23.954
I got enough porn
on other sites,

17:23.957 --> 17:26.056
I don't need it on Facebook.

17:26.058 --> 17:28.492
Then you're at work or
a kid's birthday party

17:28.493 --> 17:31.729
scrollin' through your
Facebook feed bored as hell,

17:31.731 --> 17:36.101
and then bam, big ol' P in a
V. It's like, bing, bing, bing,

17:36.103 --> 17:39.004
and then all of a sudden, your
boss or a little kid sees it.

17:39.006 --> 17:40.939
Before you know it, you're
sittin' front row center

17:40.941 --> 17:42.709
at your own intervention.

17:42.711 --> 17:45.210
People are cryin' because
your sex addiction's

17:45.212 --> 17:47.682
hurtin' everyone, and yeah.

17:48.482 --> 17:49.317
Yeah.

17:51.552 --> 17:53.653
So, how we gonna
stay in touch?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.589
Uh, the old-fashioned way.

17:56.591 --> 17:58.491
What, writin' letters?

17:59.595 --> 18:01.761
No, give me your hand.

18:04.399 --> 18:05.234
Oh-oh.

18:06.069 --> 18:08.405
On the phone, smart.

18:09.271 --> 18:12.039
Letters are way too slow.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.375
I know.

18:13.377 --> 18:16.877
Well, uh, actually
have to get going,

18:16.879 --> 18:20.083
but see you soon, yeah?

18:20.551 --> 18:21.051
Yeah.

18:40.839 --> 18:41.674
Ah.

18:43.409 --> 18:44.244
Yeah.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.281
Yeah, all you can eat.

18:50.283 --> 18:51.916
All you can eat, yeah.

19:59.558 --> 20:01.327
Hey, get back here!

20:22.049 --> 20:24.884
Dear Barnaby, your
dad and I figured

20:24.886 --> 20:28.721
you'd spend all the money
we gave you by now on junk,

20:28.723 --> 20:31.891
so here's a little
more to get you by.

20:31.893 --> 20:35.328
P.S. this is the last
money we're giving you.

20:35.330 --> 20:39.901
P.P.S. the P.S. was your
dad again, love mom and dad.

20:54.118 --> 20:56.187
Go away, nobody's home.

20:57.621 --> 20:59.021
Come on, Henry, can't
we just see if he's okay.

20:59.023 --> 21:00.088
You're
always babying him.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.190
This is why he is the way he is.

21:02.192 --> 21:03.425
What if he's hurt?

21:03.427 --> 21:06.464
Oh, he's
fine, now come on.

21:07.665 --> 21:08.933
Love you too.

21:21.913 --> 21:22.748
Ugh!

21:34.126 --> 21:34.961
Uh!

22:47.239 --> 22:48.073
Hm.

22:49.909 --> 22:52.843
This is quite the impressive
resume you have here, Barnaby.

22:52.845 --> 22:54.679
Please, call me Arnie.

22:54.681 --> 22:56.348
All right, Arnie.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.617
This is quite the
impressive resume.

22:58.619 --> 23:00.252
Thank you, sir.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.753
On thing though, it says here

23:01.755 --> 23:05.792
you were a game developer
for Atari from 1980 to '84.

23:05.794 --> 23:08.162
Exactly how old are you?

23:08.896 --> 23:10.129
It says 1980 on there?

23:10.131 --> 23:12.532
That's correct.

23:12.534 --> 23:15.937
Uh, just a second, 30, 34,

23:16.537 --> 23:20.442
42, 43, I'm 44.

23:21.743 --> 23:25.413
Wow, really, you don't
look a day over 29.

23:26.548 --> 23:28.047
Well, unfortunately, you're-

23:28.049 --> 23:30.517
you're a bit
overqualified for the job,

23:30.519 --> 23:32.354
but thank you for coming in.

23:32.356 --> 23:36.393
Let me just cross off
a few of these here.

23:36.859 --> 23:38.327
Uh, huh.

23:40.764 --> 23:43.200
And there we go.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.101
I think you'll find

23:45.103 --> 23:48.406
I'm just the right
amount of qualified now.

23:49.139 --> 23:50.839
I like your style,

23:50.841 --> 23:53.276
but I'm afraid someone with
your amount of experience

23:53.278 --> 23:55.412
would just get bored.

23:55.414 --> 23:57.213
But I'll keep your
resume on file,

23:57.215 --> 24:01.183
and if something should come
up, I'll give you a call.

24:09.529 --> 24:10.861
It says that
you were on a team

24:10.863 --> 24:13.431
that developed a
vaccine for SARS?

24:13.433 --> 24:14.499
Is that what it says?

24:14.501 --> 24:16.702
Uh, yup, right there.

24:16.704 --> 24:17.871
Yeah.

24:19.072 --> 24:22.075
Well then, yes, I
was on that team.

24:23.010 --> 24:25.444
Mm-hmm, it was a
lotta long days,

24:25.446 --> 24:27.146
about five of them to be exact.

24:27.148 --> 24:30.550
Wait, you cured
SARS in five days?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.452
That's what I just said.

24:32.454 --> 24:37.459
You know, I remember
the day I cured SARS.

24:38.659 --> 24:42.364
I was like, guys,
I think I got it.

24:43.099 --> 24:45.201
I think I got the cure.

24:46.602 --> 24:50.638
And they were like, no way,
and I was like, yes way,

24:50.640 --> 24:54.376
and then I showed them the
cure, and they were like, nice,

24:54.378 --> 24:56.578
except for Jessica, she
was a little jealous,

24:56.580 --> 24:59.480
so she was like, psh, whatever.

24:59.482 --> 25:02.316
Anyway, we went out in public,

25:02.318 --> 25:05.587
then started stickin'
needles in people

25:05.589 --> 25:09.025
and just like that,
SARS is cured.

25:09.027 --> 25:10.793
Just like that.

25:10.795 --> 25:12.195
Yeah, just like that.

25:12.197 --> 25:13.429
So, you just went out

25:13.431 --> 25:16.097
and started sticking
needles in people?

25:16.099 --> 25:20.336
Um, yeah, I mean, how do
you think people get vaccines?

25:21.773 --> 25:24.941
Um, I don't know,
doctors' appointments.

25:24.943 --> 25:28.045
Oh yeah, well,
you could do that,

25:28.047 --> 25:30.014
but SARS was spreading fast,

25:30.016 --> 25:32.650
and we were under
emergency protocol.

25:32.652 --> 25:33.487
Right.

25:34.921 --> 25:37.689
Um, I'm actually gonna have
to get back to you on the job,

25:37.691 --> 25:40.258
um, but you don't mind if I
hang onto your resume, do you?

25:40.260 --> 25:42.060
So, I can show everyone.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.028
I mean, it's not every
day the guy who cured SARS

25:44.030 --> 25:47.132
comes into your work, right?

25:47.134 --> 25:48.067
Yeah.

25:48.069 --> 25:49.201
It's cool, I have copies.

26:11.494 --> 26:12.960
Yeah, I don't care!

26:12.962 --> 26:16.831
I'm gonna leave the toilet
seat up if I want to, Sharon!

26:16.833 --> 26:17.735
Yes?

26:18.601 --> 26:19.935
I'm here about the job.

26:19.937 --> 26:22.204
I saw in the paper
you're hiring.

26:27.410 --> 26:29.311
Do you know how to
rake and bag leaves?

26:29.313 --> 26:31.448
Huh, doesn't everyone?

26:33.083 --> 26:35.417
Can you start today?

26:35.419 --> 26:36.953
Today?

26:36.955 --> 26:40.125
I mean, tomorrow's
actually better.

26:42.661 --> 26:44.562
Today's good, I can do today.

26:44.564 --> 26:46.265
All right, here.

26:46.998 --> 26:48.631
This is the address.

26:51.170 --> 26:55.142
Be there in one hour
and change your clothes.

26:56.977 --> 27:00.477
Sharon, for the last time, I
don't know whose urine that is!

27:00.479 --> 27:03.515
All right, what I need you to do

27:03.517 --> 27:07.085
is to rake and bag this whole
entire section of the park.

27:07.087 --> 27:08.789
Can you do that?

27:09.656 --> 27:11.791
That's gonna take forever.

27:11.793 --> 27:16.228
Well, it looks like you
better get started then, huh?

27:16.230 --> 27:19.665
Why don't I do just
a small area today,

27:19.667 --> 27:22.170
like that parkin' lot?

27:22.904 --> 27:23.937
That's a parkin' lot!

27:23.939 --> 27:25.806
It has no grass on it!

27:25.808 --> 27:28.809
Well, there's a little
grass right there,

27:28.811 --> 27:30.310
and then I'll do
the rest tomorrow.

27:30.312 --> 27:33.514
No, what I need you
to do is to rake and bag

27:33.516 --> 27:34.816
this section of the park.

27:34.818 --> 27:37.420
Take this, I gotta take a piss.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.942
Well, this is just stupid.

27:59.610 --> 28:04.015
Well, he never said nothin'
about not takin' a break.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.628
Hey, hey, wake up.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.763
Wake up, time to go.

28:17.765 --> 28:18.599
Really?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.465
Yeah, really.

28:20.467 --> 28:24.468
Oh, before you go, don't
leave without your pay.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.737
This is a dollar,
I was here all day.

28:26.739 --> 28:31.179
Uh huh, you earned every cent
of it, sleepin' on the job!

28:32.346 --> 28:34.479
What time do we
start tomorrow?

28:34.481 --> 28:36.482
You don't start tomorrow.

28:36.484 --> 28:37.550
We got tomorrow off?

28:37.552 --> 28:39.552
No, we don't got tomorrow off.

28:39.554 --> 28:42.488
You don't work for me anymore!

28:42.490 --> 28:43.558
You're fired!

28:44.727 --> 28:47.129
You can't fire
me, dude, I quit.

28:49.965 --> 28:50.800
Cool.

29:00.376 --> 29:01.208
Hey.

29:01.210 --> 29:02.910
Hey.

29:02.912 --> 29:04.144
So,
what are you up to?

29:04.146 --> 29:06.649
You know,
just lookin' for a job.

29:06.651 --> 29:07.917
Is that your resume?

29:07.919 --> 29:08.851
Yeah.

29:08.853 --> 29:09.854
Can I see it?

29:10.320 --> 29:10.887
Sure.

29:16.595 --> 29:19.028
You've seriously been
applying to jobs with this?

29:19.030 --> 29:20.296
Yeah.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.700
Everything on here's made up.

29:23.702 --> 29:25.201
Well, so?

29:25.203 --> 29:26.970
Every-Everyone makes up
somethin' on their resume.

29:26.972 --> 29:28.238
Yeah, but when they do,

29:28.240 --> 29:29.941
they make sure it
sounds plausible.

29:29.943 --> 29:33.044
It says here you're a crash
test dummy for three years,

29:33.046 --> 29:34.912
an Olympic torch holder,

29:34.914 --> 29:37.781
a henchman, which even
if that were a real job,

29:37.783 --> 29:40.250
I don't know why you would
put that on an application.

29:40.252 --> 29:41.787
Why not?

29:41.789 --> 29:45.423
A professor at Oxnard, a
Knight of the Round Table,

29:45.425 --> 29:48.660
and a professional Rock
'Em Sock 'Em Robot fighter,

29:48.662 --> 29:49.895
whatever that is.

29:49.897 --> 29:51.129
Oh, it's that game
where you try and

29:51.131 --> 29:53.934
knock the other
robot's head off.

29:56.638 --> 29:59.438
Whatever, were you like
three when you wrote this?

29:59.440 --> 30:03.009
If by three you mean
yesterday, then yes.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.512
The only job on here that
sounds even remotely real

30:05.514 --> 30:07.814
is the chef job at the
mom and pop restaurant.

30:07.816 --> 30:10.350
Well, that's because
I actually did that,

30:10.352 --> 30:12.352
for a few years actually.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.387
And what happened?

30:14.389 --> 30:15.925
They fired me

30:16.927 --> 30:20.462
for putting strawberries
on pancakes.

30:20.464 --> 30:22.164
They're like, Arnie,

30:22.166 --> 30:25.433
we're not runnin' a
five-star restaurant here.

30:25.435 --> 30:27.135
They fired you just for that?

30:27.137 --> 30:29.572
Well, that and when
they told me not to,

30:29.574 --> 30:32.574
I started to put
strawberries on everything,

30:32.576 --> 30:36.879
cheeseburgers, chicken
strips, homeless people,

30:36.881 --> 30:40.617
small children, you name it,
I put strawberries on it,

30:40.619 --> 30:42.018
so technically, that's probably

30:42.020 --> 30:43.920
the real reason they fired me.

30:43.922 --> 30:45.455
Got it.

30:45.457 --> 30:48.391
So, why haven't you tried to
look for another cooking job.

30:48.393 --> 30:49.826
I mean, being a chef somewhere

30:49.828 --> 30:51.928
sounds like kind of a big deal.

30:51.930 --> 30:56.335
I don't know, it's just
not what I thought it'd be.

30:57.503 --> 30:59.070
Do you have any
idea what it's like

30:59.072 --> 31:01.972
to have a culinary degree and
then end up working at a place

31:01.974 --> 31:03.842
where the fanciest
thing on the menu

31:03.844 --> 31:06.245
is a grilled cheese and ham?

31:06.247 --> 31:08.279
It's terrible.

31:08.281 --> 31:10.783
Yeah, sounds like
a total nightmare.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.084
I'm being serious.

31:13.086 --> 31:16.389
I went to school with dreams
of doing amazing things,

31:16.391 --> 31:18.557
making food that
looked like art,

31:18.559 --> 31:21.228
being on the cover of one of
those stupid chef magazines,

31:21.230 --> 31:23.363
and now I don't even
have a place to stay.

31:23.365 --> 31:26.401
You're living out of your car?

31:26.868 --> 31:27.635
Yeah.

31:28.605 --> 31:31.105
Kind of already knew.

31:31.107 --> 31:32.673
Really?

31:33.710 --> 31:35.643
Well, when Chris and Noah

31:35.645 --> 31:37.444
entered the gymnasium
for our reunion,

31:37.446 --> 31:40.581
they yelled out, Barnaby's
living out of his car!

31:40.583 --> 31:44.120
So, most of our
graduating class knows.

31:45.622 --> 31:47.755
Well, this has been the
most emotional week ever.

31:47.757 --> 31:51.693
First, my girlfriend dumps
me, my parents kick me out,

31:51.695 --> 31:53.428
they don't even
tell me to my face,

31:53.430 --> 31:55.365
they just put all
my stuff in a box

31:55.367 --> 31:57.569
and wrote me this letter.

32:06.212 --> 32:07.477
Barnaby's bucket list.

32:07.479 --> 32:08.646
That's
the wrong letter.

32:08.648 --> 32:11.782
One, get past
level one on Pac-Man.

32:13.252 --> 32:16.221
Two, hold my breath under
water for 30 seconds.

32:16.223 --> 32:21.228
Three, stay in a hotel room
with no parents and jump on bed.

32:22.094 --> 32:24.329
Wow, these are quite ambitious.

32:24.331 --> 32:25.463
For your information,

32:25.465 --> 32:27.698
I have completed
everything on that list.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.069
Well, except for jumpin'
on the hotel bed,

32:30.071 --> 32:33.572
but I mean, who's gonna rent
a hotel room to a kid, right?

32:33.574 --> 32:35.841
And yes, I'd say
for a 17-year-old,

32:35.843 --> 32:38.377
that is extremely ambitious.

32:38.379 --> 32:40.580
You were 17 when
you wrote this?

32:40.582 --> 32:44.286
No, you dork,
I was like eight.

32:45.321 --> 32:47.586
Here's the real letter.

32:47.588 --> 32:48.423
Hold on.

32:51.492 --> 32:56.065
Yeah, this is, this
is the right one.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.734
Dear Barnaby, your
father and I have decided

32:59.736 --> 33:02.036
it's time for you to do
something with your life,

33:02.038 --> 33:04.672
and so, we're kicking you out.

33:04.674 --> 33:06.909
I wanted to tell you in
person, but your father said

33:06.911 --> 33:09.111
I would never go
through with it if I did

33:09.113 --> 33:11.246
and end up letting you stay.

33:11.248 --> 33:13.181
Sorry for putting all
your stuff outside,

33:13.183 --> 33:14.682
but it had to be done.

33:14.684 --> 33:18.755
P.S. no, we won't cosign
for you to get an apartment.

33:18.757 --> 33:22.558
P.P.S. that was your dad
that wrote the first P.S.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.960
Of course, we'll cosign for you,

33:23.962 --> 33:26.261
but you have to get a job first.

33:26.263 --> 33:27.665
Love mom and dad.

33:29.469 --> 33:32.103
Your mom sounds
like a sweetheart.

33:32.105 --> 33:34.838
Your dad sounds like
kind of an asshole.

33:34.840 --> 33:35.675
Yeah.

33:37.109 --> 33:41.113
Well, now I gotta get a job,
so I can get an apartment,

33:41.115 --> 33:43.749
prove to everyone
that I'm not a loser,

33:43.751 --> 33:45.617
and get my girlfriend back.

33:45.619 --> 33:48.653
Well, you can start
by fixing your resume.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.388
Get rid of all of this nonsense

33:50.390 --> 33:52.759
and build on the one
job you actually had.

33:52.761 --> 33:54.963
Okay, fine, I'll, yeah.

33:56.331 --> 33:58.697
But I'm gonna need some
spending money in the meantime.

33:58.699 --> 34:01.768
Hm, you can't
ask your parents?

34:01.770 --> 34:03.903
They wrote another
note about that too.

34:03.905 --> 34:05.505
Seriously?

34:05.507 --> 34:06.909
Yeah.

34:08.077 --> 34:09.443
Well, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

34:09.445 --> 34:12.946
I was gonna, you know,

34:12.947 --> 34:14.483
n- nothin'.

34:15.851 --> 34:17.085
I have a friend who does
these get-togethers once a month

34:17.087 --> 34:19.953
and she told me her
caterer just canceled.

34:19.955 --> 34:21.889
So, maybe you could do it?

34:21.891 --> 34:23.158
I don't know.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.493
Oh, come on, do you
need the cash or not?

34:25.495 --> 34:26.995
Fine.

34:26.996 --> 34:28.530
Okay, great.

34:28.532 --> 34:32.268
I'm gonna text you the
details, all right?

34:37.275 --> 34:39.043
Whoa oh oh oh!

34:39.643 --> 34:40.976
Woohoo!

34:40.978 --> 34:42.610
Woo!

34:42.612 --> 34:44.447
Woo baby!

34:44.449 --> 34:45.949
Oh, shake it baby!

34:45.951 --> 34:47.384
Nice butt. Ooh!

34:47.386 --> 34:48.918
Whoa oh!

34:48.920 --> 34:50.087
Whoa, all right!

35:00.300 --> 35:02.300
All of the pots, pans,
and cooking utensils

35:02.302 --> 35:04.236
are in the drawers
and cupboards.

35:04.238 --> 35:06.370
Let me know if you need
help finding anything.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.339
The guests will be
here in an hour.

35:08.341 --> 35:09.575
Any questions?

35:09.577 --> 35:11.442
Do you have a microwave?

35:11.444 --> 35:12.678
A microwave?

35:12.680 --> 35:14.346
Yeah, you know,
microwave oven.

35:14.348 --> 35:18.050
It's a, people use
it to cook stuff.

35:18.052 --> 35:19.385
I know what a microwave is.

35:19.387 --> 35:20.887
What do you need it for?

35:20.889 --> 35:23.155
Oh, well 'cause I have a
bunch of frozen TV dinners,

35:23.157 --> 35:25.557
and how else am I gonna cook it?

35:25.559 --> 35:29.796
I'm not usin' the oven, that's-
that's way too much work.

35:29.798 --> 35:32.098
You're actually going
to serve my guest garbage

35:32.100 --> 35:34.234
you got from the
frozen food section?

35:34.236 --> 35:36.102
Relax, I'm just kidding.

35:36.104 --> 35:38.071
I'll have the food
ready in an hour.

35:38.073 --> 35:41.242
Um, little hint, the next
time you wanna tell a joke,

35:41.244 --> 35:43.513
make sure it's funny first.

35:44.380 --> 35:46.083
O-kay.

36:10.975 --> 36:13.576
Wow, it smells
amazing in here.

36:13.578 --> 36:15.779
And it looks like someone's
havin' fun, look at that.

36:15.781 --> 36:16.713
You hungry?

36:16.715 --> 36:17.749
Duh.

36:17.751 --> 36:19.651
Okay, all right.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.391
Tell me what you
think about this.

36:25.258 --> 36:26.259
Be honest.

36:30.497 --> 36:31.398
It tastes

36:32.700 --> 36:34.299
incredible.

36:34.301 --> 36:36.669
I mean, I figured you can cook,

36:36.671 --> 36:39.205
but I thought it'd just be
like whatever, not like this.

36:39.207 --> 36:41.541
This is delicious.

36:41.543 --> 36:43.275
You have a gift.

36:43.277 --> 36:44.410
So, when you say delicious,

36:44.412 --> 36:46.112
do you mean delicious
when compared

36:46.114 --> 36:48.414
to the Chef Boyardee
standard you had for me

36:48.416 --> 36:50.115
or delicious when compared

36:50.117 --> 36:53.321
to actual restaurants
you've eaten at?

36:53.323 --> 36:54.922
Actual restaurants.

36:54.924 --> 36:58.628
Nice restaurants or
like fast food joints.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.828
Nice restaurants.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.730
Now, will you just shut up
and take the compliment?

37:03.732 --> 37:05.266
Yeah, all right, thank you.

37:05.268 --> 37:06.501
You're welcome.

37:06.503 --> 37:08.070
Now, what else do
you have to eat?

37:08.072 --> 37:09.306
Uh, try this.

37:15.411 --> 37:17.481
Take the whole bite there.

37:18.182 --> 37:19.283
Oh my god.

37:21.118 --> 37:22.517
That is so good.

37:22.519 --> 37:24.453
The guests are arriving,
is the food ready?

37:24.455 --> 37:25.988
Yes, it is.

37:25.990 --> 37:27.323
Well, come on then, bring
it out into the living room.

37:27.325 --> 37:29.192
Right away, Mussolini.

37:29.194 --> 37:30.693
Huh?

37:30.695 --> 37:33.699
Benito Mussolini, you
know, the French dictator.

37:35.301 --> 37:36.532
You look French,
so I just wanted

37:36.534 --> 37:38.668
to pick somethin' close to home.

37:38.670 --> 37:39.838
I know who he is.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.205
Do I look uneducated to you?

37:41.207 --> 37:42.707
Which apparently, you are

37:42.709 --> 37:45.510
because Benito Mussolini
was an Italian dictator.

37:45.512 --> 37:49.247
Either way, I'm not French
or Italian, I'm English.

37:49.249 --> 37:50.814
I was gonna say Italian.

37:50.816 --> 37:51.884
I'm sure you were.

37:51.886 --> 37:53.755
I was, Queen Mary.

37:54.888 --> 37:56.087
Is there some point
where you realize

37:56.089 --> 37:57.322
that you're being obnoxious

37:57.324 --> 37:59.891
and you stop telling
your humorless jokes?

37:59.893 --> 38:04.196
No, he's just like
this all the time.

38:04.198 --> 38:07.700
Luckily, I don't care
what either of you think

38:07.702 --> 38:10.736
because my mom
thinks I'm hilarious.

38:10.738 --> 38:13.740
Just hurry up and
bring out the food.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.078
Okay, so are you gonna help me

38:18.080 --> 38:19.446
before your friend murders me

38:19.448 --> 38:21.482
or just keep stuffin' your face?

38:21.484 --> 38:24.618
Oh god, Chloe
wouldn't hurt a fly.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.956
Please, I know the face of
a murderer when I see one.

38:27.958 --> 38:29.624
Whew!

38:29.626 --> 38:31.659
Besides, she said
she was English.

38:31.661 --> 38:33.162
You know who else is English?

38:33.164 --> 38:33.996
Who?

38:33.998 --> 38:35.463
Jack the Ripper?

38:35.465 --> 38:36.831
I was gonna say
Charles Manson,

38:36.833 --> 38:39.534
but yeah, I think
he's English too.

38:39.536 --> 38:40.469
Oh, really?

38:40.471 --> 38:41.805
Yes, now help me out with this

38:41.807 --> 38:43.772
before I end up
on a milk carton.

38:43.774 --> 38:45.509
Fine, you big baby.

39:04.064 --> 39:05.330
Boo!

39:05.332 --> 39:06.997
Please
don't kill me, Chloe,

39:06.999 --> 39:08.633
I'm too young to die.

39:08.635 --> 39:10.035
What?

39:10.037 --> 39:11.472
Really, wow.

39:12.573 --> 39:14.171
You really are
afraid of my friend.

39:14.173 --> 39:15.007
No!

39:16.643 --> 39:19.045
I was just messing with ya.

39:19.047 --> 39:21.980
I saw ya hidin' over there.

39:21.982 --> 39:23.782
Yeah, sure you did.

39:23.784 --> 39:27.186
Anyway, what are
you still doin' here?

39:27.188 --> 39:29.656
Oh, I-I just forgot something
inside of Chloe's house,

39:29.658 --> 39:31.225
so I came back to get it.

39:31.227 --> 39:35.729
Oh yeah, well if it's
leftovers, I suggest you hurry.

39:35.731 --> 39:38.231
I mean, there was a lotta
food still when I left,

39:38.233 --> 39:42.838
but that was like two
or three minutes ago,

39:43.940 --> 39:45.974
and she's all up
there by herself, so.

39:47.444 --> 39:51.214
It's-It's not the leftovers,
but thanks for the heads up.

39:52.450 --> 39:57.119
Hey, um, what are
you doin' after this?

39:57.121 --> 39:59.088
Well, I did just make $300,

39:59.090 --> 40:02.490
so I think the
obvious answer is uh,

40:02.492 --> 40:04.493
hittin' up the strip club.

40:04.495 --> 40:06.163
Seriously?

40:06.165 --> 40:08.031
Yeah, you're probably right.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.766
I'm gonna need more money if
I'm gonna go to the strip club.

40:11.837 --> 40:13.270
Why, what are you doin'?

40:13.272 --> 40:15.540
Uh, I'm-I'm not sure.

40:17.644 --> 40:21.247
Hey, do you wanna
grab a drink with me?

40:22.115 --> 40:25.215
Promise not to roofie it?

40:25.217 --> 40:26.918
I can't promise that.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.520
In that case, I'm game.

40:29.522 --> 40:32.625
Okay, cool, um,
I'll be right back.

40:41.101 --> 40:44.470
Oh, so, did you
have fun tonight?

40:44.472 --> 40:45.871
Fun doin' what?

40:47.141 --> 40:49.309
Cooking, what
else were you doing?

40:49.311 --> 40:51.313
Oh, you know what?

40:52.080 --> 40:54.348
I did have fun tonight.

40:54.350 --> 40:55.783
Yeah?

40:55.785 --> 40:57.620
- Yeah.
- I could tell.

40:58.488 --> 41:00.087
More fun than cooking those

41:00.089 --> 41:01.388
grilled cheese and
ham sandwiches?

41:02.624 --> 41:04.826
I-I don't know
if I'd go that far.

41:04.828 --> 41:06.927
You know, from time to
time, I did get pretty fancy

41:06.929 --> 41:09.664
with those grilled cheese
and ham sandwiches.

41:09.666 --> 41:10.498
Is that right?

41:10.500 --> 41:11.834
Yes, ma'am.

41:13.136 --> 41:14.335
So, what do you think?

41:14.337 --> 41:16.205
Are you gonna give
cooking another shot?

41:16.207 --> 41:18.006
I don't know, maybe.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.042
Just maybe?

41:20.044 --> 41:21.012
But.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.046
Barnaby,

41:23.981 --> 41:24.815
hello?

41:25.416 --> 41:26.314
She's here.

41:26.316 --> 41:27.951
Who's here?

41:27.953 --> 41:29.420
My ex, Elaina.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.924
You mean that girl that's
standing next to that hot guy.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.962
Joking, joking, he's
not-he's not that cute.

41:38.364 --> 41:41.801
Okay, okay, I'm not gonna
lie, he's-he's a little cute.

41:43.302 --> 41:46.772
She sees me, she's
comin' over here.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.640
Hey, Barnaby!

41:49.642 --> 41:50.941
Elaina.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.677
Wait, wait, your
name is Barney,

41:52.679 --> 41:54.013
like the children's dinosaur?

41:54.015 --> 41:57.549
No, it's Arnie, and
it's short for Barnaby.

41:57.551 --> 42:00.018
Bro, you gotta introduce
me to your friends.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.920
Are you talkin' about her?

42:01.922 --> 42:05.224
No, your friends, you
know, Barney and Friends.

42:05.226 --> 42:07.227
Who are you exactly?

42:07.229 --> 42:09.428
This is my
boyfriend, Geppetto.

42:12.333 --> 42:16.805
Geppetto, like,
Pinocchio Geppetto?

42:17.540 --> 42:18.906
Yeah, that's his name.

42:20.109 --> 42:21.741
Is that his real name
or like a nickname?

42:21.743 --> 42:24.111
It's my real name.

42:24.113 --> 42:28.619
No, so on your birth
certificate, it says Geppetto?

42:30.054 --> 42:33.354
So, your parents actually
made the conscious decision

42:33.356 --> 42:36.793
to name you after a
fairytale character.

42:37.728 --> 42:39.562
How's your brother Jiminy doin'?

42:39.564 --> 42:40.830
Would you grow up?

42:40.832 --> 42:41.864
It's okay babe, if
I was named after a

42:41.866 --> 42:43.299
giant purple dinosaur

42:43.301 --> 42:45.868
who sang and danced with
children, I'd be immature too.

42:45.870 --> 42:48.006
Babe, that's cute.

42:49.374 --> 42:50.906
How long you been
dating, a couple of days?

42:50.908 --> 42:53.077
No, actually, me and this
beautiful slice of roast beef

42:53.079 --> 42:55.813
have been together for
what, six months now?

42:55.815 --> 42:58.782
Six months, but
we were still--

42:58.784 --> 43:00.150
Who's this, your friend?

43:00.152 --> 43:03.487
His girlfriend
actually, Madison.

43:03.490 --> 43:05.256
And we were just leaving.

43:05.258 --> 43:07.993
Geppetto, so nice to meet you.

43:07.995 --> 43:10.629
Please tell the Blue
Fairy I said hello,

43:10.631 --> 43:13.464
and Elaina, Arnie told
me you were skinny,

43:13.466 --> 43:17.605
but wow, it's called food
have you heard of it?

43:21.174 --> 43:23.208
You don't think I'm
too skinny, do you babe?

43:23.210 --> 43:24.442
No, babe, you're perfect.

43:24.444 --> 43:26.244
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

43:26.246 --> 43:28.147
If anything, you could
lose some weight.

43:28.149 --> 43:29.483
So now I'm fat?

43:29.485 --> 43:31.218
No, I'm just saying
you're not that skinny.

43:31.220 --> 43:32.551
- Thanks.
- Babe, wait.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.675
Hey, are you all right?

43:53.677 --> 43:56.678
I'm fine, I just
need a minute.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.814
Look, I don't really
know you're ex-girlfriend,

43:58.816 --> 44:02.751
but from what I saw tonight,
she's a real piece of crap,

44:02.753 --> 44:05.254
and if she chose that
Geppetto guy over you,

44:05.256 --> 44:07.589
then she's definitely
not very bright either.

44:10.861 --> 44:12.096
I'm gonna go.

44:13.165 --> 44:14.332
Arnie, wait.

44:15.635 --> 44:17.867
Don't you wanna talk about it?

44:17.869 --> 44:19.836
It-it might help.

44:19.838 --> 44:21.641
Talk about what?

44:23.108 --> 44:25.409
The fact that my ex-girlfriend
was cheating on me for months

44:25.411 --> 44:27.913
with a guy who calls
her roast beef slice

44:27.915 --> 44:31.415
and happens to be the main
character of a children's book?

44:31.417 --> 44:35.687
Or how 'bout the fact
that I don't have a job?

44:35.689 --> 44:38.223
Or that I live in my car?

44:38.225 --> 44:40.659
Is that what you
wanna talk about?

44:40.661 --> 44:43.862
'Cause I don't see how talking
is gonna change any of that.

44:43.864 --> 44:47.833
Oh, okay, maybe not, but
it-it might help you move on

44:47.835 --> 44:50.104
or ease the pain a little.

44:51.506 --> 44:55.343
Face it, Madison, I'm a loser.

44:57.245 --> 45:00.682
No amount of talking
is gonna change that.

45:02.283 --> 45:04.918
You might as well just
stay away from me.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.588
You're not a loser.

45:07.590 --> 45:09.326
Goodbye Madison.

45:32.750 --> 45:35.120
How could you be so stupid?

45:36.587 --> 45:39.858
She was cheating on
you for six months,

45:40.894 --> 45:43.329
and there were so many signs.

45:44.197 --> 45:45.832
The new haircuts,

45:46.733 --> 45:48.200
the new clothes,

45:48.934 --> 45:50.169
the constant nagging,

45:51.337 --> 45:53.106
having to sleep
out on the couch,

45:54.574 --> 45:56.275
and the most obvious,

45:56.277 --> 45:59.847
when she butt dialed
you while having sex,

46:01.582 --> 46:04.450
and to think you
actually believed her

46:04.452 --> 46:07.619
when she told you
that she fell asleep

46:07.621 --> 46:10.624
while watching 15
Shades of Gray.

46:13.728 --> 46:17.864
No woman would fall
asleep while watching

46:17.866 --> 46:20.169
15 Shades of Gray.

46:25.274 --> 46:27.042
You know what Elaina?

46:28.244 --> 46:31.579
Forget you I don't
even care anymore.

46:31.581 --> 46:36.586
Elaina, I miss you so much.

46:42.126 --> 46:44.028
Hello, hi.

46:44.895 --> 46:47.798
Um, what's your biggest pizza?

46:48.966 --> 46:51.469
Oh okay, can I get
three of those?

46:53.005 --> 46:55.007
Actually make that four.

46:56.375 --> 46:58.911
Do I sound like a ninja turtle?

47:00.012 --> 47:03.781
Yeah, I want anchovies,
I want anchovies.

47:03.783 --> 47:07.618
Sunny Ranch Apartments,
unit H seven, Elaina.

47:10.823 --> 47:13.624
Hi, do you guys deliver?

47:13.626 --> 47:18.198
Perfect, can I get 30
bowls of white rice?

47:19.065 --> 47:21.333
Yeah, to Sunny Ranch Apartments.

47:21.335 --> 47:25.873
Hi, can I get one of the
six-foot subs, party subs?

47:27.242 --> 47:29.244
Ah, wait hold on.

47:30.111 --> 47:33.749
What, you wanna get two of 'em?

47:34.515 --> 47:35.851
Are you sure?

47:36.751 --> 47:37.885
Okay.

47:38.753 --> 47:41.188
Can we get, make, make that two.

47:41.190 --> 47:43.693
Um, we're pretty
hungry over here.

47:45.295 --> 47:50.300
Um, what's um, what'd you
got for your hot wings?

47:51.167 --> 47:52.336
What's the biggest order?

47:53.202 --> 47:56.472
Sixty, no that's not enough,

47:57.441 --> 47:59.874
Lemme get three of those.

48:29.642 --> 48:30.476
Hm

48:31.645 --> 48:32.576
You have four

48:32.578 --> 48:35.613
new messages, first message.

48:35.615 --> 48:38.283
Seriously Barnaby,
you think you're funny?

48:38.285 --> 48:41.320
I know it was you that
ordered the pizza.

48:41.322 --> 48:44.623
End of
message, new message.

48:44.625 --> 48:47.592
Really, 30
orders of white rice?

48:47.594 --> 48:50.128
When I see you next,
you are so dead,

48:50.130 --> 48:52.799
you hear me, you are dead!

48:52.801 --> 48:55.968
End of
message, new message.

48:55.970 --> 48:58.872
Party subs,
I take that back.

48:58.874 --> 49:01.975
I'm not going to kill
you when I see you,

49:01.977 --> 49:04.978
no, that's not good
enough for you.

49:04.980 --> 49:07.248
I'm going to hurt you so bad,

49:07.250 --> 49:08.815
you're going to
wish you were dead.

49:10.085 --> 49:11.918
Are you freaking kidding?

49:13.389 --> 49:16.091
I have a
delivery of wings for Elaina?

49:17.361 --> 49:20.963
Argh, you better hope I
dint find you, Barnaby!

49:20.965 --> 49:24.298
End of
message, new message.

49:24.300 --> 49:26.267
I'm looking at all
this food you had delivered

49:26.269 --> 49:29.005
and I've decided I'm
gonna save it for you.

49:29.007 --> 49:30.406
I'm going to find you,

49:30.408 --> 49:32.275
I'm going to take
you back to my place,

49:32.277 --> 49:33.777
and I'm going to tie you up

49:33.779 --> 49:36.712
and make you eat all of it
until your gut explodes.

49:36.714 --> 49:38.447
And after that happens,

49:38.449 --> 49:42.019
I'm going to make you
keep eating until you die!

49:42.021 --> 49:43.753
Remember that movie Seven?

49:43.755 --> 49:45.689
Yeah, that's gonna be you,

49:45.691 --> 49:48.158
dead in my living
room you asshole!

49:48.160 --> 49:52.330
End of message,
you have no new messages.

49:52.332 --> 49:53.834
Whoa!

50:20.562 --> 50:24.899
Excuse me sir, it's illegal
to be naked in public.

50:27.603 --> 50:29.839
Come on, don't run.

50:42.285 --> 50:44.486
Hey Madison, it's me Arnie.

50:44.488 --> 50:46.154
I just wanted to
call and apologize

50:46.156 --> 50:49.124
for the way I acted last night.

50:49.126 --> 50:51.360
And uh, if you're free later,

50:51.362 --> 50:54.663
I'll be at the basketball
court by the beach.

50:54.665 --> 50:57.368
So uh, hope to see you there.

50:58.536 --> 51:01.739
All right, talk
to you later, bye.

51:11.416 --> 51:14.586
Ah, I remember you,

51:16.422 --> 51:19.759
got you on our first
Valentine's together.

51:21.395 --> 51:23.730
What are you so happy about?

51:28.602 --> 51:33.338
And this, from when you said
we'd always be together.

51:33.340 --> 51:36.143
Well, we both know
how that turned out.

51:57.066 --> 51:58.900
Goodbye, Elaina.

52:08.913 --> 52:10.815
Nice shot, Gramps.

52:11.549 --> 52:14.382
Ah god, not you again.

52:14.384 --> 52:16.552
I bet I know what
you do for a living,

52:16.554 --> 52:17.987
you're a brick layer.

52:17.989 --> 52:19.822
Get it, a brick layer?

52:19.824 --> 52:21.191
Yeah, I get it.

52:21.193 --> 52:23.594
Don't you have
school or something?

52:23.596 --> 52:24.762
It's Saturday.

52:26.164 --> 52:28.499
Don't you have like a job
to go to or something?

52:28.501 --> 52:29.700
It's Saturday.

52:29.702 --> 52:32.102
So, my dad works
on a Saturday.

52:32.104 --> 52:34.339
Yeah, I'm sure your
dad works every day

52:34.341 --> 52:36.107
if he has to make
enough to feed you.

52:36.109 --> 52:37.942
And I bet you have
to work two jobs

52:37.944 --> 52:40.445
just to afford the candles
on your birthday cake.

52:40.447 --> 52:42.181
I gotta be honest
with you kid,

52:42.183 --> 52:43.715
I'm a little jealous of the fact

52:43.717 --> 52:46.384
that when you go places you
get the group discount rate.

52:46.386 --> 52:47.885
And I'm kinda jealous

52:47.887 --> 52:51.691
that you get the senior
discount when you go places.

52:51.693 --> 52:55.394
That's basically what I
just said but good for you.

52:55.396 --> 52:58.098
Hey, isn't it almost 4:00?

52:58.100 --> 52:59.598
Shouldn't you be at Costco

52:59.600 --> 53:01.401
before they stop givin'
out all the free samples?

53:01.403 --> 53:04.237
Shouldn't you be at home
watching silent movies?

53:04.239 --> 53:05.538
As much as I'd
love to stand here

53:05.540 --> 53:07.241
and do this with you all day,

53:07.243 --> 53:10.580
I have better things
to do, so get lost.

53:28.565 --> 53:30.466
Hey Arnie.

53:30.468 --> 53:33.469
Hey, I want sure if
you got my message.

53:33.471 --> 53:35.804
Wait, you know this guy?

53:35.806 --> 53:37.339
Are you Arnie's friend?

53:37.341 --> 53:40.977
Who him, you think
I'm his friend?

53:40.979 --> 53:42.345
He wishes.

53:42.347 --> 53:43.881
Yeah, whatever.

53:43.883 --> 53:47.584
I'm Will, but you can
call me whatever you want.

53:47.586 --> 53:49.653
Nice to meet you
Will, I'm Madison.

53:49.655 --> 53:52.290
Hey, whoa, whoa, get your
grubby little hands off of her.

53:52.292 --> 53:54.859
Whoa, don't be jelly, bro.

53:54.861 --> 53:56.928
Yeah Arnie, don't be jelly.

53:56.930 --> 54:00.699
I'm not jel-I'm
not jealous all right?

54:00.701 --> 54:04.537
Wait, is this old
timer your boyfriend?

54:04.539 --> 54:06.204
Would you get lost?

54:06.206 --> 54:09.041
Fine I'll go,
but if you need me,

54:09.043 --> 54:11.811
I'll be on the bleachers
in the winners' section.

54:11.813 --> 54:13.881
Cool, now leave.

54:15.584 --> 54:18.551
You have no idea how
annoying that kid is.

54:18.553 --> 54:21.488
Yeah well, he seems
like he likes you.

54:21.490 --> 54:23.857
Oh, I think he likes
you a little bit more.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.835
Do you know how
to play basketball?

54:34.837 --> 54:36.637
Maybe you should
stick to cooking.

54:36.639 --> 54:40.241
Aha, someone
thinks they're funny.

54:40.243 --> 54:42.579
Let's see you do better.

54:48.718 --> 54:49.753
Lucky shot.

54:50.553 --> 54:51.656
Oh yeah?

54:55.460 --> 54:57.025
Still think it was lucky?

54:57.027 --> 54:58.594
How 'bout a little one-on-one?

54:58.596 --> 55:01.697
Oh, are you sure you
wanna lose to a girl?

55:01.699 --> 55:03.300
You know I don't
wanna embarrass you.

55:03.302 --> 55:04.501
Oh I don't think I'm the one

55:04.503 --> 55:06.537
that's gonna be
gettin' embarrassed.

55:06.539 --> 55:08.939
Okay, you wanna
make this interesting?

55:08.941 --> 55:09.874
How so?

55:09.876 --> 55:11.776
If I win, you're gonna let me

55:11.778 --> 55:16.214
fix that ridiculous resume
you've been handing out.

55:16.216 --> 55:18.683
Fine, but if I win,

55:18.685 --> 55:21.453
you have to help me
Saran wrap Elaina's car.

55:21.455 --> 55:25.391
Okay, done deal, but
I get the ball first.

55:27.461 --> 55:28.994
Hey wait I wasn't ready.

55:28.996 --> 55:33.567
Doesn't matter, one zero,
first one to get to 11 wins.

55:35.436 --> 55:37.871
I got 20 bucks on the girl.

55:41.444 --> 55:42.408
Woo!

55:42.410 --> 55:45.578
Tss, we'll take that action.

55:47.850 --> 55:50.216
Can you even throw
the ball that far?

55:50.218 --> 55:53.122
I don't know, let's find out.

56:04.535 --> 56:07.370
Oh, what, two points!

56:26.959 --> 56:28.293
Next point wins.

56:29.062 --> 56:30.328
Ha, gay!

56:40.340 --> 56:42.907
Whew, and that's game.

56:42.909 --> 56:47.348
Hey grandpa, thanks,
you just won me 20 bucks!

57:00.861 --> 57:04.833
Hey, I wanna say
sorry for last night.

57:06.002 --> 57:08.101
Aw, you don't
have to apologize.

57:08.103 --> 57:09.904
I probably would have
acted the same way

57:09.906 --> 57:12.540
if I found out my ex
that I just broke up with

57:12.542 --> 57:15.610
was cheating on me while
I was still with them.

57:15.612 --> 57:19.814
Still I mean, I shouldn't
have taken it out on you.

57:19.816 --> 57:22.483
Yeah you're kind of a dick.

57:22.485 --> 57:24.653
You're just lucky I'm so cool.

57:24.655 --> 57:26.922
You know, most girls would
have blown you off by now.

57:26.924 --> 57:29.257
Well you're just
lucky that I'm so cool.

57:29.259 --> 57:30.525
Most guys wouldn't let a girl

57:30.527 --> 57:32.627
beat them in a
game of basketball,

57:32.629 --> 57:34.964
especially not with their
reputation on the line.

57:34.966 --> 57:36.598
Would you give it up?

57:36.600 --> 57:39.101
We both know you
didn't let me win.

57:39.103 --> 57:41.037
That's what'll help
you sleep at night.

57:41.039 --> 57:43.005
Okay, lets play
again right now.

57:43.007 --> 57:45.474
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

57:45.476 --> 57:48.345
I don't know, I'm still a
little tired from the last game.

57:48.347 --> 57:49.845
How about we do it nother day?

57:49.847 --> 57:52.649
Okay, either you admit that
I beat you fair and square,

57:52.651 --> 57:54.752
or we're gonna play
again right now.

57:54.754 --> 57:57.123
Fine, lets go again,

57:58.290 --> 57:59.857
but don't expect me
to go easy on you.

57:59.859 --> 58:04.332
Fine, just don't expect
me to go easy on you either.

58:05.498 --> 58:08.199
Wait, you were
goin' easy on me?

58:22.984 --> 58:25.618
You do realize you'd have
to be like 1,500 years old

58:25.620 --> 58:27.288
to have some of the
jobs you listed?

58:27.290 --> 58:31.559
I know, I look pretty
good for my age, right?

58:31.561 --> 58:34.396
I'm like, Brendan Fraser...

58:34.998 --> 58:36.764
Tom Cruise.

58:46.242 --> 58:50.077
So if you had to get rid of
one holiday, what would it be?

58:50.079 --> 58:51.214
Only one?

58:51.216 --> 58:52.915
Mm-hmm.

58:52.917 --> 58:54.616
Easy, Valentine's Day.

58:54.618 --> 58:58.589
Ah, a romantic, why's that?

58:59.790 --> 59:02.792
Well, for starters, I
already know I'm single,

59:02.794 --> 59:05.461
I don't need a national
holiday reminding me.

59:05.463 --> 59:06.930
And even if I wasn't,

59:06.932 --> 59:09.365
I'm only a month and a
half away from New Year's,

59:09.367 --> 59:11.568
I haven't broken my
resolution to lose weight yet

59:11.570 --> 59:14.137
and then here we are with
a holiday where I get

59:14.139 --> 59:17.909
showered with chocolate
gifts, ya know?

59:17.911 --> 59:19.277
What about you?

59:19.279 --> 59:22.846
I'd have to say
Valentine's Day too for me,

59:22.848 --> 59:24.415
but for different reasons.

59:24.417 --> 59:27.186
You see I am terrible
at giving gifts.

59:27.188 --> 59:29.588
One year, because I
know how important

59:29.590 --> 59:31.423
personal hygiene is to women,

59:31.425 --> 59:35.061
I got Elaina
deodorant, mouthwash,

59:35.063 --> 59:39.334
hair removal gel, and a
feminine freshness kit.

59:41.035 --> 59:43.236
You know, for her um.

59:43.238 --> 59:45.406
Yeah, no, I got it.

59:46.607 --> 59:49.208
Well, she was pissed,
and then the next year,

59:49.210 --> 59:51.079
I got her the morning after pill

59:51.081 --> 59:53.046
with a little note that said

59:53.048 --> 59:54.817
this is for tomorrow.

59:55.585 --> 59:57.617
She, she hated that too.

59:59.155 --> 01:00:00.954
Yeah I wonder why?

01:00:00.956 --> 01:00:03.158
Yeah, and then most recently,

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.794
I took her to a special
screening of Unfaithful.

01:00:06.796 --> 01:00:08.196
Really?

01:00:08.198 --> 01:00:11.600
That's kind of ironic
of you think about it.

01:00:11.602 --> 01:00:14.268
Yeah, no wonder she
kept lookin' at me weird

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:17.239
the whole time, ah.

01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:19.175
She probably thought
you were on to her.

01:00:19.177 --> 01:00:21.911
Luckily she doesn't know
how dumb you really are.

01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:25.148
Funny, heh, ha, ha.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:26.549
Now would you focus please?

01:00:26.551 --> 01:00:28.519
This resume isn't
gonna fix itself.

01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:31.421
I know, that's why I got you.

01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:32.923
Well, you wanted to do it.

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.493
Right, I realize that
but had I known at the time

01:00:35.495 --> 01:00:37.194
that I'd be doing all the work

01:00:37.196 --> 01:00:38.663
I would have asked
for something else.

01:00:38.665 --> 01:00:39.931
Hm.

01:00:39.933 --> 01:00:41.933
Is the degree
in culinary real,

01:00:41.935 --> 01:00:43.902
or did you make those up to?

01:00:43.904 --> 01:00:47.773
Yes it's real, I'm not
a complete loser, jeez.

01:00:47.775 --> 01:00:51.144
Well, I'm sorry but it's hard
to take any degree seriously

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:53.579
when it's listed after
your degrees in law,

01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:57.950
nuclear engineering,
politics, economics,

01:00:57.952 --> 01:00:59.417
and adventure.

01:00:59.419 --> 01:01:01.220
You know, I actually
can't believe

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:04.958
you put you earned a
degree in adventure,

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.761
wait you do know that's
not a real degree, right?

01:01:10.598 --> 01:01:12.866
Looks like the
jokes on you Madison,

01:01:12.868 --> 01:01:16.204
turns out that adventure
is a real degree.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.472
Really?

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.640
Yeah, I looked it
up on the internet.

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:23.644
Huh, and how does one
earn a degree in adventure?

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.213
Well isn't it obvious?

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:27.382
By going on adventures.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:30.386
Ya know, I'm sorry
I asked, delete.

01:01:30.388 --> 01:01:31.219
Aw.

01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:38.896
So, favorite quarterback?

01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:40.930
All-time or currently playing?

01:01:40.932 --> 01:01:42.132
Currently playing.

01:01:42.134 --> 01:01:43.400
Easy, Tom Brady.

01:01:43.402 --> 01:01:45.137
Tom Brady?

01:01:46.271 --> 01:01:49.405
Over Drew Brees,
Aaron Rodger, Manning?

01:01:49.407 --> 01:01:51.142
And no, not Eli.

01:01:51.144 --> 01:01:52.410
Seriously?

01:01:52.412 --> 01:01:54.444
Seriously, what?

01:01:54.446 --> 01:01:57.247
Tom Brady's made six
Super Bowl appearances,

01:01:57.249 --> 01:01:59.283
he's tied with Joe Montana
for Super Bowl wins

01:01:59.285 --> 01:02:01.585
and not to mention, he's
been to the Pro Bowl

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:05.458
11 times and NFL MVP twice.

01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:07.425
Yeah.

01:02:07.427 --> 01:02:09.427
So, I expanded your duties
at the mom and pop restaurant,

01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:12.231
and I highlighted your
culinary training and degree,

01:02:12.233 --> 01:02:15.567
and I've added myself and
a friend as a reference.

01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:16.403
Hm.

01:02:17.705 --> 01:02:20.707
Chloe, the serial killer?

01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:21.674
Yes, her.

01:02:21.676 --> 01:02:23.178
She hates me.

01:02:24.312 --> 01:02:26.312
I'm not gonna get a job
if they call her up.

01:02:26.314 --> 01:02:28.882
Relax, she's not
gonna say anything bad.

01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:30.817
When I went back to
get my stuff I forgot,

01:02:30.819 --> 01:02:32.085
she wouldn't stop talking about

01:02:32.087 --> 01:02:33.587
how much she loved your food.

01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:35.755
Okay, well, if
I turn up missing,

01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:39.227
you know who to have the
police question first, right?

01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.095
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Barnaby} Okay.

01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:43.298
All right, so I'm gonna
print some of these off

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.633
when I get home, and then
I'll give 'em to you later?

01:02:45.635 --> 01:02:46.469
Cool.

01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:49.970
So, you ready
to have some fun?

01:02:49.972 --> 01:02:52.609
What did you have in mind?

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.214
Is that what I think it is?

01:02:58.216 --> 01:02:59.016
Uh huh.

01:03:00.585 --> 01:03:03.421
Remind me never
to make you mad.

01:03:26.981 --> 01:03:28.479
No, you dork.

01:03:28.481 --> 01:03:30.581
Like this, see, roll
it from underneath,

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:31.650
so it doesn't get stuck.

01:03:31.652 --> 01:03:33.218
- Oh.
- See?

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.452
My bad.

01:03:34.454 --> 01:03:36.488
I didn't realize
you were an expert.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:40.362
So uh, you Saran wrap
a lotta cars or what?

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:43.263
A few.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:44.797
Serious?

01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:46.765
Yes, now come on, we
have to go under the car

01:03:46.767 --> 01:03:48.033
and then over the roof.

01:03:48.035 --> 01:03:49.403
Obviously.

01:03:55.378 --> 01:03:56.212
Ah.

01:03:57.713 --> 01:03:59.179
It's my friend's wedding,

01:03:59.181 --> 01:04:03.886
and I thought we'd surprise
her with an early wedding gift.

01:04:12.796 --> 01:04:13.696
Keep goin'.

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:21.704
All right, let's go hide and
wait for her to come out.

01:04:21.706 --> 01:04:22.774
Okay.

01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:24.009
There.

01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:26.878
Sorry.

01:04:34.553 --> 01:04:35.888
Ding, ding, pow.

01:04:44.498 --> 01:04:46.130
So, you gonna tell me
about those other cars

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.599
you Saran wrapped?

01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:48.435
Nope.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:52.039
Come on, was it ex-boyfriends?

01:04:54.008 --> 01:04:55.640
Ex-girlfriends?

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.175
It doesn't matter.

01:04:57.177 --> 01:04:59.512
I knew it, ex-girlfriends.

01:04:59.514 --> 01:05:00.845
Right on.

01:05:00.847 --> 01:05:03.183
It was an ex-boyfriend, okay?

01:05:03.185 --> 01:05:05.719
Found out he had
a wife and a son.

01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:07.389
Just leave it alone.

01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:12.458
All right, so a
what, you Saran wrapped

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.926
both his and his wife's car?

01:05:15.865 --> 01:05:18.198
You know, you can be a
little stupid sometimes.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.101
Only sometimes.

01:05:20.103 --> 01:05:24.439
Did you just accidentally
give me a compliment?

01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:26.277
Shh, here she comes.

01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:35.518
Barnaby!

01:05:37.254 --> 01:05:39.755
You're dead next time I see you!

01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:44.226
Barnaby, is that you?

01:05:44.228 --> 01:05:46.061
Get over here so I
can kick your ass.

01:06:17.865 --> 01:06:18.932
What the?

01:06:21.836 --> 01:06:23.004
Ooh!

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.708
Were you just trying
to break into my car?

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:30.409
No, this is your car?

01:06:30.411 --> 01:06:31.478
I thought it was mine.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.880
You have the same car?

01:06:33.882 --> 01:06:36.819
What kinda car is this then?

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:38.588
SUV.

01:06:39.722 --> 01:06:42.055
I meant make
and model, genius.

01:06:42.057 --> 01:06:44.628
Uh, Ford?

01:06:45.095 --> 01:06:45.762
No.

01:06:46.662 --> 01:06:47.861
Chevy?

01:06:47.863 --> 01:06:49.263
Okay, now you're
just guessing.

01:06:49.265 --> 01:06:50.799
Hey, some people don't know

01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:52.636
what kind of car
they drive, right?

01:06:53.237 --> 01:06:54.802
Uh, I guess.

01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:57.741
Wait a second, don't I know you?

01:07:00.344 --> 01:07:01.810
No.

01:07:01.812 --> 01:07:04.180
You're the asshole that stole
my bag of cans and ran off.

01:07:04.182 --> 01:07:07.082
Hey, you mistook
me for someone else.

01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:08.552
No, I know it's you.

01:07:08.554 --> 01:07:12.222
You're wearin' that same
silly pants and everything!

01:07:14.893 --> 01:07:16.261
What's that?

01:07:22.368 --> 01:07:24.402
I can still see you.

01:07:24.404 --> 01:07:26.505
Uh, no, you can't.

01:07:26.507 --> 01:07:27.474
Yes.

01:07:28.175 --> 01:07:29.441
No?

01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:33.113
Whatever dude, just
stay away from my car!

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.616
Excuse me, sir.

01:08:07.618 --> 01:08:09.216
This is the second
time I tell you

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.517
it's illegal to be
naked in public.

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:13.587
We're gonna have to take you in.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.190
Quit resisting,
you're under arrest!

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.493
Is he resisting?

01:08:17.495 --> 01:08:18.661
He sure is.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:19.461
Looks like we're
gonna have to tase him!

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.662
No, I'm not resisting.

01:09:04.312 --> 01:09:06.345
Thanks for bailin' me out.

01:09:06.346 --> 01:09:08.214
No problem.

01:09:08.216 --> 01:09:09.715
Nice clothes.

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:13.486
It's all they had.

01:09:13.488 --> 01:09:14.953
What happened to your clothes?

01:09:14.956 --> 01:09:16.890
Did they not give 'em back?

01:09:16.892 --> 01:09:19.359
I wasn't wearing any
clothes when they arrested me.

01:09:19.361 --> 01:09:20.292
What?

01:09:20.295 --> 01:09:21.729
You were naked?

01:09:21.731 --> 01:09:23.729
If naked means I wasn't
wearing any clothes,

01:09:23.732 --> 01:09:25.332
then yeah, I was naked.

01:09:25.334 --> 01:09:26.466
What happened?

01:09:26.469 --> 01:09:27.734
Wait, why were you naked

01:09:27.737 --> 01:09:29.537
and what did you'd
do to get arrested?

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.640
Well apparently,
they have a law

01:09:31.642 --> 01:09:34.408
against showering
naked in public.

01:09:34.411 --> 01:09:36.143
Stupid, right?

01:09:36.145 --> 01:09:37.377
Why have a shower
in a public place

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.549
if you can't take a
naked shower under it?

01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:41.384
You mean beach showers?

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.019
Because I'm pretty sure you're
only supposed to use those

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.923
to like get sand
off of your body.

01:09:46.925 --> 01:09:48.457
Really?

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.126
Yeah.

01:09:50.127 --> 01:09:51.394
Oh.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.630
Well, good news, I
sent off your resume

01:09:54.632 --> 01:09:57.000
to a couple of restaurants
that were looking for a chef.

01:09:57.002 --> 01:09:58.434
One of 'em messaged me back

01:09:58.436 --> 01:10:00.603
and they want you to
come in for an interview.

01:10:00.605 --> 01:10:02.207
Cool.

01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:04.408
Don't sound too excited.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:07.112
I just don't think I'm gonna
make it to that interview.

01:10:07.114 --> 01:10:08.212
Why?

01:10:08.214 --> 01:10:09.881
Well, I told you already,

01:10:09.883 --> 01:10:12.183
I don't really wanna
be a chef anymore.

01:10:12.185 --> 01:10:13.851
But you're good at it.

01:10:13.853 --> 01:10:16.555
And this isn't gonna be
like the last job you had.

01:10:16.557 --> 01:10:19.290
Their menu is amazing,
I made sure of it.

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:20.559
I know you're gonna like it.

01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:21.894
It's not that.

01:10:21.896 --> 01:10:23.128
Then what is it?

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:27.366
It's, uh, you ever,
you ever just think

01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:29.002
that you'd be further
along in your life

01:10:29.004 --> 01:10:31.103
when you got to this age.

01:10:31.105 --> 01:10:33.339
I mean, look how old we are.

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:36.142
I thought when I got this
old, I'd have a house, wife,

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:41.150
kids, an actual career I can
be proud of, but look at me.

01:10:41.917 --> 01:10:43.483
If I take this job,

01:10:43.485 --> 01:10:44.986
they'll most likely start
me off at a low position,

01:10:44.988 --> 01:10:49.723
and I'll waste even more time
tryin' to move my way up,

01:10:49.725 --> 01:10:50.992
and I'll be in the
same place I was in

01:10:50.994 --> 01:10:53.694
when I graduated
from high school.

01:10:53.696 --> 01:10:56.230
And then, what if
that doesn't work out?

01:10:56.232 --> 01:10:58.032
I don't wanna be 40
livin' out of my car

01:10:58.034 --> 01:11:01.336
tryin' to figure out
what to do with my life.

01:11:03.241 --> 01:11:06.309
I don't think anybody
has it figured out, Arnie.

01:11:06.311 --> 01:11:07.776
You think having a good job

01:11:07.778 --> 01:11:09.913
and a house and
family'd change that?

01:11:09.915 --> 01:11:11.681
Because I know a lot of
people who have those things,

01:11:11.683 --> 01:11:13.550
and they're just as
confused as you are.

01:11:13.552 --> 01:11:16.052
I highly doubt that.

01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:18.689
Everything always looks
better from the outside in.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.790
You know what you should
do with your life?

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:22.325
Something that you love.

01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:25.029
What is it that you love, Arnie?

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.764
I guess I do like to cook.

01:11:26.766 --> 01:11:28.001
Then cook.

01:11:29.168 --> 01:11:30.936
You know, most people
spend their life

01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:33.638
searching for something
they love, and you found it.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.107
So in my book, you're
way ahead of the rest.

01:11:37.109 --> 01:11:38.810
You do have a point.

01:11:38.812 --> 01:11:40.181
Uh, yeah.

01:11:42.115 --> 01:11:43.950
What is it that you like to do?

01:11:43.952 --> 01:11:44.785
Me,

01:11:45.954 --> 01:11:47.185
I like to eat.

01:11:48.455 --> 01:11:50.490
So, I guess that makes
us the perfect pair.

01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:52.225
I guess we are.

01:11:52.227 --> 01:11:55.697
Speaking of food, I am starving.

01:11:56.598 --> 01:11:58.865
The prison food was terrible.

01:11:58.867 --> 01:12:00.766
Do you wanna get somethin'?

01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:02.369
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:13:57.295 --> 01:13:59.396
Thanks for comin' with me.

01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:02.902
Hey, relax, you're
gonna do fine.

01:14:03.869 --> 01:14:05.268
You think so?

01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.505
I know so.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:09.876
I don't know.

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:15.048
It's been a long time since
I've cooked at this level.

01:14:15.783 --> 01:14:17.918
Maybe we should just go.

01:14:18.785 --> 01:14:20.654
Look at me, Arnie.

01:14:22.088 --> 01:14:25.791
You're an amazing cook, and
you're gonna go in there,

01:14:25.793 --> 01:14:30.630
and they're gonna see that,
and they're gonna love you.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.098
Maybe.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.000
Would you stop dong that?

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:35.167
Doing what?

01:14:35.169 --> 01:14:37.170
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.773
I don't feel sorry for myself.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:42.309
Yes, you do, all
the time, actually.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.449
It's not that I feel
sorry for myself, it's just,

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:50.787
I don't know if I'm good enough.

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:55.425
And I don't wanna go in there
and make a fool outta myself.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.362
But Arnie, you
are good enough.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.165
Oh, maybe.

01:15:05.436 --> 01:15:09.707
Look, you can have all
the talent in the world,

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:12.208
but if you don't
believe in yourself,

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.345
it really doesn't
matter, does it?

01:15:15.347 --> 01:15:19.015
And maybe you go in there
and totally screw up,

01:15:19.017 --> 01:15:20.917
but who cares?

01:15:20.919 --> 01:15:22.819
At least you went in
there and found out

01:15:22.821 --> 01:15:26.927
instead of spending the rest
of your life wondering what if.

01:15:28.328 --> 01:15:31.730
You know, you can be quite
persuasive when you want to be.

01:15:31.732 --> 01:15:32.930
I know.

01:15:32.932 --> 01:15:36.201
Um, my driver-side
door is broken,

01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:39.204
so I have to.

01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:40.806
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

01:15:40.808 --> 01:15:41.640
Sorry.

01:15:41.642 --> 01:15:42.710
It's all good.

01:15:45.179 --> 01:15:46.645
Got it?

01:15:47.948 --> 01:15:49.282
There ya go.

01:15:50.952 --> 01:15:52.119
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:53.652
Okay.

01:15:53.654 --> 01:15:56.022
Why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

01:15:56.024 --> 01:15:59.925
Well, my name is Barnaby,
but everyone calls me Arnie,

01:15:59.927 --> 01:16:02.897
and I recently broke
up with my girlfriend

01:16:02.899 --> 01:16:04.599
who I later found out
had been cheatin' on me

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:06.669
for the last six months.

01:16:09.071 --> 01:16:11.007
What I meant to say is,

01:16:12.876 --> 01:16:16.377
I love to cook, and after
graduating culinary school,

01:16:16.379 --> 01:16:20.849
I got a terrible job at
a terrible restaurant,

01:16:20.851 --> 01:16:23.851
nothing like this place,
this place is great,

01:16:23.853 --> 01:16:26.789
and I forgot how
much I love to cook,

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.825
but then recently, a really
amazing friend of mine

01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:32.529
reminded me of how
much I love it.

01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:36.168
Heat, the smell, the art,

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:40.137
watching people's faces light
up when they taste your food,

01:16:40.139 --> 01:16:42.839
and so here I am.

01:16:42.841 --> 01:16:45.609
What do you know
about our restaurant?

01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:48.846
Well, I know you're open from
11:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m.

01:16:48.848 --> 01:16:50.182
Sunday through Monday,

01:16:50.184 --> 01:16:53.117
open until midnight
Friday and Saturday,

01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:56.454
have been voted best local
restaurant three years running,

01:16:56.456 --> 01:16:59.890
have a menu consisting
of 60% Italian dishes,

01:16:59.892 --> 01:17:01.527
and are located
in a part of town

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:04.630
that receives a lot of
high-end consumer foot traffic.

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:06.998
Well done, you've
done your homework.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.202
You're damn right I did.

01:17:09.204 --> 01:17:13.371
Well now, in front of you
are several ingredients.

01:17:13.373 --> 01:17:15.742
I want you to write
me a menu and cook it.

01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:18.444
You have 30 minutes
starting from now.

01:17:20.982 --> 01:17:21.883
Yes?

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:24.485
Is menu with one n or two?

01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:29.593
Just kiddin', I know it's two.

01:18:22.616 --> 01:18:25.685
Ha, you can put
your hands down now.

01:18:25.687 --> 01:18:26.520
Right.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:34.593
So, what do you think?

01:18:34.595 --> 01:18:38.598
For someone who can't spell
menu, that's quite good.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.200
I know there's only one n.

01:18:40.202 --> 01:18:42.135
And no e on the end.

01:18:44.073 --> 01:18:46.005
Well, I've got one
more interview,

01:18:46.007 --> 01:18:48.142
but you should be
hearing from me soon.

01:18:48.144 --> 01:18:49.844
Awesome.

01:18:49.846 --> 01:18:50.681
Thank you.

01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:02.524
So, got a little bored
while I was waiting,

01:19:02.526 --> 01:19:04.092
and I was digging
through your stuff,

01:19:04.094 --> 01:19:06.895
and I found your
autograph football.

01:19:06.897 --> 01:19:08.163
Oh yeah?

01:19:08.165 --> 01:19:09.198
It's cool, right?

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.666
Yeah.

01:19:10.668 --> 01:19:12.734
It took me like two weeks
to forge the signatures.

01:19:12.736 --> 01:19:14.070
I bet.

01:19:14.072 --> 01:19:14.906
So?

01:19:16.742 --> 01:19:18.741
How'd it go in there?

01:19:18.743 --> 01:19:21.345
Uh, she has one other
person to interview,

01:19:21.347 --> 01:19:24.247
uh, but it looks
like I got the job.

01:19:24.249 --> 01:19:25.717
Really?

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.884
Yeah, well, I mean, she's
gonna call me tomorrow.

01:19:27.886 --> 01:19:29.086
See?

01:19:29.088 --> 01:19:30.455
And you didn't
wanna go in there.

01:19:30.457 --> 01:19:31.856
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:33.193 --> 01:19:34.825
Let's go celebrate.

01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:36.126
Okay.

01:19:36.128 --> 01:19:37.964
Where do you wanna go?

01:19:39.266 --> 01:19:41.200
I have a place in mind.

01:19:41.202 --> 01:19:42.734
Get in, I'll drive.

01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:16.237
Oh, I gotta be honest.

01:20:16.239 --> 01:20:17.505
When I woke up this morning,

01:20:17.507 --> 01:20:20.277
I did not see my
day ending here.

01:20:21.879 --> 01:20:23.346
Is that right?

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.683
You, uh, didn't see
your day ending with you

01:20:27.685 --> 01:20:32.057
crossing off the final
thing from your bucket list?

01:20:33.425 --> 01:20:34.991
Oh.

01:20:34.993 --> 01:20:37.125
That's what this is about?

01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:39.496
I thought we were gonna--

01:20:39.498 --> 01:20:42.000
Oh, I know what you thought.

01:20:43.668 --> 01:20:47.038
So, you wanna come
up here and join me?

01:20:47.539 --> 01:20:48.404
Yes.

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:08.726
Oh, when I was a kid,

01:21:08.728 --> 01:21:11.262
I thought this was
gonna be a lot more fun.

01:21:11.264 --> 01:21:14.601
Yeah, uh, I guess it has lost

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.704
some of its fun
over the years, huh?

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.509
So, what do you wanna do?

01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:23.876
Well, I still have some
of the money left over

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:27.081
from when I cooked
for your friend.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:29.649
How 'bout we pig
out on room service?

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:31.051
Thought you'd never ask.

01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:44.765
Okay, you
gotta try this one.

01:21:49.773 --> 01:21:52.809
Oh my god, that is terrible.

01:21:52.811 --> 01:21:54.110
I know, right?

01:21:54.112 --> 01:21:57.779
Hm, why would you
make me taste that?

01:21:57.781 --> 01:21:59.449
You're the one
that ordered it.

01:21:59.451 --> 01:22:00.285
Ugh.

01:22:03.089 --> 01:22:03.922
So,

01:22:06.259 --> 01:22:09.293
I don't think I ever
told you thanks.

01:22:09.295 --> 01:22:10.995
For what?

01:22:10.997 --> 01:22:12.431
For everything.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.736
I don't know where I'd be
right now if it wasn't for you.

01:22:17.738 --> 01:22:19.737
It's no problem.

01:22:19.739 --> 01:22:23.241
I'm sure you would've
done the same for me.

01:22:23.243 --> 01:22:24.077
Yeah.

01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:27.180
What?

01:22:27.182 --> 01:22:28.349
Nothin'.

01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:29.584
Tell me.

01:22:30.884 --> 01:22:32.020
It's just,

01:22:33.353 --> 01:22:35.988
I've never seen someone

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:39.193
eat food without chewing.

01:22:41.996 --> 01:22:45.565
I know you can do it, I've
just never seen it done before.

01:22:45.567 --> 01:22:47.268
Okay, shut up.

01:22:48.003 --> 01:22:49.503
Ah, I was just jokin'.

01:22:49.505 --> 01:22:50.606
Yeah, sure.

01:22:53.143 --> 01:22:57.411
So, whatever happened to that
married guy you were datin'?

01:22:57.413 --> 01:22:59.747
Were you two
together for a while?

01:22:59.749 --> 01:23:03.253
Um, yeah, we were,

01:23:04.387 --> 01:23:06.455
we were together
for quite some time.

01:23:06.457 --> 01:23:08.190
Like a few months?

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:09.825
Two years.

01:23:09.827 --> 01:23:11.093
He was married the whole time

01:23:11.095 --> 01:23:15.064
and you didn't figure
that out for two years?

01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:18.569
What about women's
intuition and all that?

01:23:20.071 --> 01:23:22.740
I'm sorry, continue.

01:23:23.408 --> 01:23:25.911
Um,

01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:29.313
well, the whole
time we were dating,

01:23:29.315 --> 01:23:33.951
I was always busy working and
I was taking night classes.

01:23:33.953 --> 01:23:37.955
Um, we didn't see
each other that much.

01:23:37.957 --> 01:23:40.626
I mean, I always figured
he was hiding something,

01:23:40.628 --> 01:23:45.263
but I also thought maybe I
was just imagining things.

01:23:45.265 --> 01:23:47.598
How'd you find out
about his wife and kids?

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.270
That was by accident really.

01:23:50.272 --> 01:23:53.905
Um, I was out with
a friend somewhere

01:23:53.907 --> 01:23:57.511
and um, there he was,

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.245
across the street
at a little cafe

01:24:00.247 --> 01:24:02.816
with his wife and son,

01:24:02.818 --> 01:24:06.288
and they looked like
a regular family.

01:24:07.789 --> 01:24:10.025
I mean, they looked so happy,

01:24:13.297 --> 01:24:16.464
and he looked over
at me at one point,

01:24:16.466 --> 01:24:18.366
and then he went back
to talking to his wife

01:24:18.368 --> 01:24:19.567
and playing with his son,

01:24:19.569 --> 01:24:22.939
like he didn't even
know who I was.

01:24:24.007 --> 01:24:26.941
What a real sack of shit.

01:24:26.943 --> 01:24:29.211
So, what'd you do?

01:24:29.213 --> 01:24:30.982
Did you tell his wife?

01:24:32.215 --> 01:24:33.217
Key his car?

01:24:34.619 --> 01:24:35.650
Egg his house?

01:24:37.055 --> 01:24:37.889
No.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:39.425
Uh

01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:42.558
I just deleted
him from my phone,

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.264
and I've been single ever since.

01:24:46.764 --> 01:24:50.101
You know, I didn't even tell
my friends what happened.

01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:53.006
I, uh, I was too embarrassed.

01:24:55.108 --> 01:24:59.477
You're actually the first
person I've ever told.

01:24:59.479 --> 01:25:00.678
Well, this night

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.515
has really taken a turn
for Depressionville.

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:09.121
Oh, well, you're the one
who asked me about my ex.

01:25:09.123 --> 01:25:10.355
Well, I just didn't know

01:25:10.357 --> 01:25:13.560
you were gonna make it
sound so sad, you know?

01:25:13.562 --> 01:25:15.194
Oh, oh, okay.

01:25:15.196 --> 01:25:18.967
Um, was-was I supposed
to make it sound happy?

01:25:20.369 --> 01:25:25.140
Well, you could made
it a little more happier.

01:25:26.742 --> 01:25:27.576
I'm sorry,

01:25:28.978 --> 01:25:32.849
I'm gonna stop talking
now and go take a shower.

01:25:34.783 --> 01:25:37.052
It's been a while
since I've taken shower

01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:38.855
in an actual bathroom.

01:25:42.192 --> 01:25:46.194
Okay, so, yeah,

01:25:46.196 --> 01:25:48.265
I'll be in the shower.

01:25:59.676 --> 01:26:01.112
Did you want one?

01:26:07.186 --> 01:26:10.052
Hey, Madison, you really gotta

01:26:10.054 --> 01:26:12.691
try this shower before we leave.

01:26:15.961 --> 01:26:18.630
It's got one of those
shower heads with the hoses,

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:22.233
so you can get all
up in your spaces.

01:26:22.235 --> 01:26:24.771
It's really quite amazing.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.842
Hey, Madison, did
you hear what I said?

01:26:29.844 --> 01:26:32.311
Got one of those shower
heads with the, uh.

01:27:37.117 --> 01:27:37.950
Hello.

01:27:40.887 --> 01:27:41.721
This is him.

01:27:44.925 --> 01:27:45.758
Really?

01:27:48.127 --> 01:27:49.963
No, that's great news.

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.468
Where at?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.374
When would you want
me to be there by?

01:28:01.544 --> 01:28:03.711
Yes, I can be there then.

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:06.948
No, thank you.

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:09.817
Bye.

01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:24.000
Madison?

01:28:26.203 --> 01:28:27.038
Yeah.

01:28:31.508 --> 01:28:32.842
I got the job.

01:28:35.011 --> 01:28:38.081
They wanna hire me as head chef.

01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:39.416
I start Monday.

01:28:39.418 --> 01:28:40.983
What?

01:28:40.985 --> 01:28:42.887
That's great, Arnie.

01:28:44.623 --> 01:28:48.291
What's wrong, why
do you look so sad?

01:28:48.293 --> 01:28:50.196
They want me to move.

01:28:52.031 --> 01:28:52.865
Far.

01:28:55.802 --> 01:28:57.103
How-how far?

01:28:58.137 --> 01:28:59.138
Seattle.

01:29:02.475 --> 01:29:04.109
That is far.

01:29:04.111 --> 01:29:05.713
Tell me about it.

01:29:09.782 --> 01:29:14.520
Well, it sounds like
a great opportunity.

01:29:14.522 --> 01:29:17.091
You should definitely go for it.

01:29:18.525 --> 01:29:20.528
I mean it is, but, uh.

01:29:22.296 --> 01:29:23.197
But what?

01:29:28.037 --> 01:29:31.140
I don't know, it's
just really far.

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:36.009
Head chefs take
vacations, right?

01:29:36.011 --> 01:29:37.179
Yeah.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.050
Then you can always
come and visit.

01:29:42.052 --> 01:29:43.286
I guess so.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.662
So, when do you have to leave?

01:29:52.664 --> 01:29:55.230
I should probably leave by,

01:29:55.232 --> 01:29:57.432
well, I should probably leave
in the next couple of hours

01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:00.271
if I'm gonna be there by Monday.

01:30:01.607 --> 01:30:04.074
Yeah, you should
probably get to it, then.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.913
Would you stop looking so sad?

01:30:09.915 --> 01:30:11.750
This is good news.

01:30:13.653 --> 01:30:15.588
I guess you're right.

01:30:27.868 --> 01:30:30.402
So, this is real, you're-
you're really moving?

01:30:30.404 --> 01:30:33.371
Yeah Dad, I'm really movin'.

01:30:33.373 --> 01:30:35.040
I told you we should
never have kicked him out.

01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:36.810
Now, we're never
gonna see him again.

01:30:36.812 --> 01:30:40.046
Relax Mom, I'll
be back to visit.

01:30:40.048 --> 01:30:41.014
Promise?

01:30:41.016 --> 01:30:43.816
Yes, every chance I get.

01:30:43.818 --> 01:30:46.185
All right, well
give your mom a hug.

01:30:46.187 --> 01:30:48.320
Goodbye, Mom.

01:30:48.322 --> 01:30:50.190
No, this is not goodbye.

01:30:50.192 --> 01:30:53.462
This is, this is see ya later.

01:30:55.197 --> 01:30:57.698
All right, see ya later, Mom.

01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.600
All right, I have to go in

01:30:59.602 --> 01:31:01.535
before the neighbors see me cry.

01:31:02.906 --> 01:31:05.607
So, tell me more about
this friend of yours.

01:31:05.609 --> 01:31:07.644
Who, Madison?

01:31:08.811 --> 01:31:10.077
Eh, is that the
name of the girl

01:31:10.079 --> 01:31:13.016
who's uh, dancing to
music in your car?

01:31:17.489 --> 01:31:19.589
Yeah, that's her.

01:31:19.591 --> 01:31:20.758
She's amazing.

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.128
Yeah?

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.528
Yeah.

01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:30.535
Well hey, if it doesn't
work out in Seattle,

01:31:31.704 --> 01:31:33.269
or if you wanna
stick around here

01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:36.908
and give it another
shot for any reason,

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:39.043
you're welcome to move back in.

01:31:39.045 --> 01:31:40.845
Thanks, Dad.

01:31:40.847 --> 01:31:45.583
Besides, your mom's driving
me crazy without you here.

01:31:45.585 --> 01:31:46.650
Give your old man a hug.

01:31:46.652 --> 01:31:47.785
I need to go check on your mom.

01:31:47.787 --> 01:31:49.189
- Okay
- Hm.

01:32:29.333 --> 01:32:30.166
Hold on a second.

01:32:31.602 --> 01:32:34.936
This is getting,
nice really, really Arnie?

01:32:34.938 --> 01:32:36.373
Wow.

01:32:37.209 --> 01:32:38.040
Well, uh,

01:32:40.045 --> 01:32:42.047
I guess this is goodbye.

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.881
No goodbyes,
only see ya later.

01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:47.652
That's funny.

01:32:48.787 --> 01:32:50.687
That's what my mom just said.

01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:52.723
Your mom sounds
like a smart woman.

01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:53.559
Yeah.

01:32:54.793 --> 01:32:59.030
Well, um, I'll call
you when I get there.

01:32:59.899 --> 01:33:02.069
Let you know how everything is.

01:33:02.802 --> 01:33:04.134
If that's okay with you.

01:33:04.136 --> 01:33:05.972
Yeah, I'd-I'd like that.

01:33:07.007 --> 01:33:08.008
All right.

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:09.709
Well,

01:33:11.078 --> 01:33:12.947
I guess I should be going.

01:33:18.887 --> 01:33:20.722
See ya later, Arnie.

01:33:24.826 --> 01:33:25.758
Madison.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.594
Yeah?

01:33:31.767 --> 01:33:33.635
I'll see ya later.

01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:35.204
Later.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.026
I noticed you
forgot a signature,

01:34:29.028 --> 01:34:32.030
and don't worry, I let a
little air out of your ball

01:34:32.032 --> 01:34:34.435
to make it more realistic.

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:50.483
Dear Future Employer,
what can I say

01:34:50.485 --> 01:34:54.854
other than I love to cook,
and I mean I really love it.

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:58.524
Put me in the kitchen and I
light up like a Christmas tree.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:01.095
Madison, you're such a dork.

01:35:01.097 --> 01:35:04.765
And the food I put on the
plate, it's phenomenal.

01:35:04.767 --> 01:35:06.801
I promise that if you
give me the opportunity

01:35:06.803 --> 01:35:10.907
to show you what I can
do, I won't let you down.

01:35:54.288 --> 01:35:56.255
You did this for me?

01:35:56.257 --> 01:35:57.223
What?

01:35:58.392 --> 01:36:00.926
Oh no, it's for one
of your neighbors.

01:36:00.928 --> 01:36:02.361
They should be comin'
out any moment.

01:36:02.363 --> 01:36:03.962
Smart ass.

01:36:03.964 --> 01:36:05.565
Wait, what about the job?

01:36:05.567 --> 01:36:07.600
About that, I
thought about it,

01:36:07.602 --> 01:36:10.770
and do I really
wanna live in a place

01:36:10.772 --> 01:36:14.575
where the NFL team mascot
isn't even a real bird?

01:36:14.577 --> 01:36:17.011
You passed up a job
because of a mascot.

01:36:17.013 --> 01:36:20.047
Well, that and you.

01:36:22.518 --> 01:36:25.019
So, does that
mean you like me?

01:36:25.021 --> 01:36:28.824
Well, I don't know if
I'd go as far to say like.

01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:32.193
What's between like and loathe?

01:36:32.195 --> 01:36:34.161
Would you shut up
and kiss me already?

01:36:50.048 --> 01:36:51.280
Before we go any further,

01:36:51.282 --> 01:36:53.649
I should probably put
those candles out.

01:36:53.651 --> 01:36:55.085
Yeah, we should
definitely do that

01:36:55.087 --> 01:36:57.253
before your car catches on fire.

01:36:57.255 --> 01:36:58.755
What were you thinking
setting up candles

01:36:58.757 --> 01:37:00.090
inside of your car anyway?

01:37:00.092 --> 01:37:02.534
Oh, I don't know, I
thought it was romantic.
