I'm en route.

04:39.095 --> 04:43.794

I'll call you when I have anything more.
I'm here. All right.

05:06.622 --> 05:10.058
Inspector, it's up this way.
- What do we got, Lou?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.853
- SNEU team took it hard.
- Who?

05:12.028 --> 05:15.088
Ruiz and Gillick, DOA. Mercer and
Cavanaugh, getting worked on now.

05:15.264 --> 05:17.232
Motherfucker.
We know how this happened?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.424
Still sorting it out.

05:18.601 --> 05:19.932
Is the XO working?
- No.

05:20.103 --> 05:22.537
I want his ass notified and here,
forth-fucking-with.

- Keep the press back...

05:27.043 --> 05:28.305
...and I mean fucking very.

05:28.478 --> 05:30.070
- Make a lane for these buses.
- Yes.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.270
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

05:31.447 --> 05:32.937
This is a royal cluster, sir.

05:33.116 --> 05:35.346
- What do we know, Tom?
- We don't know shit, sir.

05:35.518 --> 05:39.045
We know there was an anonymous call,
shots fired, that SNEU picked up...

05:39.222 --> 05:41.349
...and went 84 immediately on.

05:41.524 --> 05:44.425
Two minutes later, the neighbors call in,
another shot's fired.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.256
They think the fucking building's
coming down around them.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.594
Sectors respond, and they come to this
fucking bloodbath.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.337
How's he doing?
- Multiple gunshot wounds.

05:56.506 --> 05:57.973
He likely?
- Lost a lot of blood.

05:58.141 --> 06:01.372
Inspector, we got this covered.
You ought to be with your men.

06:01.544 --> 06:04.513
- These are my fucking men.
- Yes, sir.

06:07.016 --> 06:11.009

Yeah. Let's get him on the bus.

- Critical, we gotta get him out.

You hang tough, Billy.
You fucking hang on, brother.

06:28.037 --> 06:31.700
I'm gonna see you at the hospital,
all right? You fucking hang tight, man.

06:31.874 --> 06:33.569
Watch the door.

06:35.411 --> 06:38.710
Let's fucking move.
Get these cars out of here!

06:38.881 --> 06:40.644
Yo, we gotta make a lane for the bus.

06:42.051 --> 06:43.985
Right here.
- Move that one out of here.

Lonnie. Oh, my God.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.658
You know this guy?
- We know him. We know him.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.667
I'll ride with you.
- Talk to him. Keep his eyes open.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.327
Upstairs, second floor.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.167
We've got the block locked down,
the crime scene secured.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.707
A level-three mobilization
worked out on anything...

07:07.877 --> 07:10.903
What the fuck is Ruiz doing in here
lying with these scumbags?

07:11.080 --> 07:12.308
Go.
- Get him out of here!

07:12.482 --> 07:14.382
<i>Central, you got any...?</i>

07:14.550 --> 07:17.178

Being assembled. Smitty's on point.

08:36.399 --> 08:38.025
All right. I want the best men available.

The severity of the situation
is such I want cops we can trust.

08:47.910 --> 08:50.777
Don't beat yourself up here, Franny.
There's no blame in this.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.609
There's not a goddamned thing
any one of us could've done.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.577
My cops, my command, Pop.

08:55.751 --> 08:59.050
We lose officers in the line, Francis.
It's not your fault.

08:59.222 --> 09:03.022
Forty years wading through shit like this,
watching our guys die.

09:03.192 --> 09:04.284
You keep the rage.

09:05.094 --> 09:07.460
You cut the rest of it loose.

Let me go! I wanna see
my fucking husband.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.295
I can't let you back here.
There's nothing I can do.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.265
I wanna see my fucking husband!

Trish.

Hell of a thing, huh?

10:43.859 --> 10:45.588
Good you came.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.993
You were there for Lonnie at least, huh?

10:48.798 --> 10:50.231
Yeah.

10:50.399 --> 10:54.768
I sat down with Bill Avery and Armstrong.
We're gearing up task force.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.235
Yeah, well, everyone's gonna
want in on that.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.302
You're gonna get all the oranges.

11:01.477 --> 11:04.241
How about you throw your hat in the ring?
Make a phone call.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.812
Me?

11:08.117 --> 11:10.244
No. No, definitely not.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.387
Don't you think it's time you got back...

11:12.555 --> 11:15.217
...after two years on the tit
feeling sorry for yourself?

11:15.391 --> 11:17.951
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I'm just not up for that.

11:18.127 --> 11:21.927
How about Lonnie? You feel sorry for him?
His wife, his kids?

11:22.098 --> 11:25.295
- You guys came up together.
- Oh, come on. Don't lay that on me, okay?

11:25.468 --> 11:27.800
- If it was you, he'd be all over this.
- Yeah.

11:27.970 --> 11:30.200
- Be the first one signing up.
- I know that.

11:31.340 --> 11:35.003
Not a goddamn thing I can do
for Lonnie now, Pop.

11:35.177 --> 11:37.372
I held his hand
in the back of that ambulance...

11:37.546 --> 11:39.707
...and even that didn't do any good.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.274
He died looking into the face
of a friend, Raymond.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.079
Yeah.

11:49.658 --> 11:52.593
You're too smart not to know
that you're wasting your talent...

11:52.762 --> 11:54.286
...in goddamn Missing Persons.

11:54.463 --> 12:00.026
- For you, it's a fucking dumping ground.
- Yeah, well, it doesn't bother me.

12:00.202 --> 12:01.931
It bothers you.

12:03.172 --> 12:04.639
Yeah, look.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.468
Pop, it's been a shitty night, okay?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.837
I just wanna get out
of these fucking clothes...

12:09.011 --> 12:11.070
...and wash this whole day off.
I'll see you.

12:11.247 --> 12:13.238
Don't turn your back on me, Raymond.

12:13.416 --> 12:17.546
You're my kid, my blood, but you
might as well be a fucking Martian.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.678
Okay.

12:20.923 --> 12:23.892
I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say,
and then I'm out of here.

12:24.059 --> 12:26.755
I'm walking out, and it's over.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.063
I want you on the task force.

12:29.532 --> 12:31.591
I want you on the task force.

12:31.767 --> 12:35.134
But fuck if I'm gonna go after
a favor and have you run from it.

12:35.304 --> 12:38.205
Now, the men who were killed
were under your brother's command.

12:38.374 --> 12:42.504
You could be a benefit here and show you're
worth all that early praise and promise.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.738
Show everybody that gives a shit
that you haven't abandoned them.

12:45.915 --> 12:49.078
Now, Raymond, do me a favor.
Forget the past.

12:49.251 --> 12:51.219
Forget Mott Haven, all that shit.

12:51.387 --> 12:54.845
Now is now. I know it's a hell of a thing
to break back in on...

12:55.024 --> 12:58.721
...but you worked those streets. You know
the neighborhoods up and down. Yes?

12:58.894 --> 13:00.623
Yeah, I worked those streets, Pop.

13:00.796 --> 13:02.889
Okay, so you take the task-force spot...

13:03.065 --> 13:05.863
...and you go at it
with all the gifts God gave you.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.537
Cops died here, Raymond.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.472
Four cops.

13:16.278 --> 13:21.113
And no matter what we've forsaken
of ourselves, we can't forsake them.

13:22.618 --> 13:24.984
Don't sit on your hands here, kiddo.

13:26.655 --> 13:29.180
Don't sit on your hands here.

13:36.332 --> 13:38.766
<i>I knew you couldn't stay away</i>
<i>from all this forever.</i>

13:38.934 --> 13:40.333
<i>Yeah, don't get used to it.</i>

13:40.503 --> 13:43.336
So, what do we got?
Crime Scene process these tracks?

13:43.506 --> 13:44.837
Yeah, it's done.

13:45.007 --> 13:48.773
They get anything off the canvass?
- Uh-uh. Still pending, bro.

13:48.944 --> 13:50.411
So they found our guy up there?

13:50.579 --> 13:53.912
Yeah, Gillick.
Must've went up when it popped off.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.847
Got hit halfway up,
fell back on the landing.

13:57.019 --> 14:00.352
Wait, they're still calling this a 911, right?
Shots-fired call?

14:00.523 --> 14:02.457
Yeah. Why?

14:02.892 --> 14:05.918
Well... I mean...

14:06.262 --> 14:08.730
I don't know, man.
How you figure this went down?

14:08.898 --> 14:12.561
I mean, our guys go in, maybe they
take down the guy right inside the door.

14:12.735 --> 14:16.671
Then the whole thing touches off and you
got a lot of firing, very close quarters.

14:16.839 --> 14:20.605
So that shooter, I mean, wherever he is,
he could've split, but he didn't.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.767
He dug in, shot it out.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.311
I mean, maybe he
surprised them somehow.

14:25.481 --> 14:27.176
Maybe.

14:28.050 --> 14:29.415
Somebody hit him.

14:29.585 --> 14:33.419
He comes out,
catches Gillick coming up the stairs.

14:33.589 --> 14:36.285
Then he comes down,
he's dumping blood all over the place.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.154
And he splits for the street.
Then he does what?

14:39.328 --> 14:42.092
He didn't hail a cab.
He have a car waiting?

14:42.264 --> 14:45.290
Go.
- Could've jacked somebody.

14:47.736 --> 14:50.261
Whoever he was, he was no amateur.

14:50.439 --> 14:53.101
No, he's just a lucky
motherfucking perp, man.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.074
Maybe.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.912
What's up, Ray?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.646
Is that you?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.519
No.

15:06.689 --> 15:08.384
Is that yours?

15:09.491 --> 15:11.186
Where is that?

15:11.860 --> 15:15.227
I got it, I got it.
- No, no, don't touch that. Don't touch that.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.237
You got a bag?

15:32.247 --> 15:34.647
All right. All right, listen up.
Here's what we got.

15:34.817 --> 15:37.479
We ran the stamp name on the smack
recovered at the scene.

15:37.653 --> 15:39.177
It's called WMD.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.223
Six hits, six names.
Their sheets and mug shots are inside.

15:43.392 --> 15:47.123
Not a big group, so we should be able to
iso these fuckers and close them out.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.025
So I'm gonna say it again.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.393
Share your information. Anything.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.997
Hints, hunches,
any scrap or shred of information.

15:55.170 --> 15:58.503
I don't care if it goes off the back
of a matchbook, a strung-out CI.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.541
Put it inside the fives, get it in print
and get it to me.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.007
- Where's our list?
- I got it.

16:03.178 --> 16:04.975
Anybody speak Spanish?

16:05.147 --> 16:08.378
- Yeah, I'm all right. What's up?
- I need some help with an interview.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.211
Hey, vouch that and do a dump on it.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.718
- See how quick they can turn it around.
- All right.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.378
- What's up?
- Got a kid inside...

16:14.556 --> 16:18.219
...who might have seen something, but
I can't understand a word they're saying.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.123
And <i>papi's</i> giving me a hard time.

16:20.295 --> 16:23.753
- Yeah, all right. I'll give it a shot.
- All right.

16:41.984 --> 16:43.008
Yeah, all of it.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.455
That's right. Take it easy.
You hit the calm button, all right?

16:47.623 --> 16:51.354
If I gotta put an arm on you, you're
gonna spend Christmas in central booking.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.020
He's just a little boy.
You don't understand.

17:28.196 --> 17:30.062
No, I know, I know.

17:30.232 --> 17:33.793
I just need him to point me
in the right direction. Please.

17:34.436 --> 17:38.429
Come on, now. We really need
your help here. Just five minutes, okay?

17:42.177 --> 17:46.477
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man, calm down.
It's the fucking holidays.

18:05.134 --> 18:06.692
It's Manny?

18:12.574 --> 18:14.838
- You speak English okay, Manny?
- Uh-huh.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.570
Okay. This is gonna be easy. Okay.

18:18.113 --> 18:19.740
So...

18:20.649 --> 18:22.014
Now, you remember last night?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.277
There was some loud noises
across the street.

18:24.453 --> 18:26.080
Guns?

18:26.255 --> 18:28.689
Yeah, there were guns.
You know what guns sound like?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.621
I hear them lots of times.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.123
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

18:36.732 --> 18:40.259
Okay, so when you heard the guns,
where were you?

18:40.435 --> 18:42.995
Were you over by the door
in your daddy's shop?

18:43.172 --> 18:44.196
Uh-huh.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.638
Yeah? Could you see out onto the street?
Did you have a good view of the street?

18:47.810 --> 18:49.038
Mm-hm.

18:49.244 --> 18:52.441
Okay. Now, when the guns
stopped shooting...

18:52.614 --> 18:57.916
...do you remember if a man ran out
from behind that building?

18:58.086 --> 18:59.485
Uh-huh.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.087
And did he get into a car?

19:02.257 --> 19:04.691
- Uh-huh.
- He did.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.488
Okay, now,
I want you to think for a second.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.597
Did that man look like
he was hurt to you?

19:11.767 --> 19:14.031
In the leg, he was bleeding.

19:14.203 --> 19:16.603
In the leg, he was bleeding.

19:17.339 --> 19:20.740
- In the belly, he was...
- In his belly?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.035
Uh-huh.

19:22.311 --> 19:26.975
Okay. Manny, that's the guy
that I'm looking for. Okay?

19:27.149 --> 19:32.348
So I'm gonna show you some pictures.
Just a couple pictures of people.

19:32.521 --> 19:37.015
And if you see the guy that you saw,
the guy who got in that car, you tell me.

19:37.192 --> 19:38.523
Manny.

19:42.865 --> 19:44.457
Okay? All right.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.398
How about this guy?

19:47.970 --> 19:49.835
Is that him?

19:55.477 --> 19:57.240
How about him?

19:58.146 --> 19:59.443
No?

20:02.484 --> 20:04.179
How about him?

20:05.754 --> 20:07.415
How about that one?

20:10.559 --> 20:12.220
That's the man?

20:13.228 --> 20:15.253
That's the man that you saw?

20:15.430 --> 20:16.954
Mm-hm.

20:17.933 --> 20:18.957
You sure?

20:21.270 --> 20:23.704
Do you remember
what color that car was?

20:23.872 --> 20:27.535
- Um. White.
- White.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.870
- <i>You sound pretty sure about that.</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

20:30.712 --> 20:32.304
<i>It was a cab.</i>

20:32.481 --> 20:34.949
<i>But not the yellow kind.</i>

20:35.117 --> 20:37.142
<i>Manny, you're good, man.</i>

20:37.319 --> 20:40.516
<i>You don't remember if it had two doors</i>
<i>or four doors, do you?</i>

20:40.689 --> 20:43.249
<i>Um... Four.</i>

20:43.425 --> 20:45.586
<i>You have a great memory.</i>

20:45.761 --> 20:49.219
<i>Anything else?</i>
<i>You remember anything else?</i>

20:49.398 --> 20:51.389
<i>He looked scared.</i>

20:51.566 --> 20:54.467
<i>Who? Who looked scared?</i>

20:54.636 --> 20:57.901
<i>The man driving the car.</i>

20:58.874 --> 21:01.104
<i>He looked really scared.</i>

21:23.332 --> 21:25.061
What do we got?

21:26.268 --> 21:30.034
It's the fucking cabbie. Tezo must've
whacked him and had someone pick him up.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.763
He's a fucking <i>que pasσ,</i> Jimmy.

21:31.940 --> 21:35.137
Fucking termite choking on splinters,
had a run of good fucking luck.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.005
No one's that fucking lucky, Kenny.

21:37.179 --> 21:40.842
Tezo got tipped off our boys were
coming through that door to get him.

21:41.016 --> 21:42.813
Christ.

21:43.151 --> 21:45.244
You gotta give
the little fuck credit, though.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.981
On the fly, under pressure?
It's a fucking tight piece of work here.

21:49.157 --> 21:52.183
We gotta find this guy, Jimmy.
We gotta kill this prick.

21:52.361 --> 21:53.453
These guys were... Jesus.

21:53.628 --> 21:55.823
Hey, do me a big favor, all right?
All of you.

21:55.998 --> 21:59.229
Say nothing about this I don't already
know. It's a waste of fucking words.

22:00.602 --> 22:03.935
They're dead. Our money's missing. There's
only one of those things we can get back.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.170
Yeah, we all loved those guys.

22:07.342 --> 22:10.903
It was a shitty way to punch out,
so pray they died quick and leave it alone.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.070
First things first, we got handed up.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.682
By who, we're gonna find out
real quick. Get the can.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.751
We gotta pull the pin on this fuck now.

22:17.919 --> 22:21.355
- The rat squad gets an angle on this...
- They'll blow our shit sky-high.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.820
What about Casado?

22:22.991 --> 22:26.290
What about him? Still wants Tezo
taken out. Nothing's changed.

22:26.461 --> 22:28.486
How do we know Tezo
didn't jet out of town?

22:28.663 --> 22:30.756
Because his fucking juice is here.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.834
Goes somewhere else speaking next to no
English, he's fucking washing dishes.

22:36.304 --> 22:37.464
Get it good, Kenny.

22:37.639 --> 22:41.871
We leave nothing for them. We stay out
in front of the task force on this.

22:42.044 --> 22:45.104
You got a gun, you got passport
to wherever this prick's holed up.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.847
Toss every block in the five boroughs
till we find this piece of shit.

23:33.128 --> 23:35.062
I'm sorry, Mr. Tezo.

23:35.230 --> 23:36.891
I'm sorry.

23:40.035 --> 23:41.593
Baby.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.871
Bring me a potato.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.200
I'm sorry.

23:49.377 --> 23:51.208
Damn it. Fuck, I don't like that.

24:06.595 --> 24:11.464
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It hurts. I am sorry.

24:12.968 --> 24:13.992
Hello?

24:21.943 --> 24:24.434
Oh, you think?
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.479
I'm gonna fucking cut you, doc.

24:28.316 --> 24:32.810
Okay, we are done.
That should do it for us.

24:34.289 --> 24:38.453
We need money for this <i>mamaρι,</i>
this bullshit <i>dagabanza.</i>

24:43.431 --> 24:45.296
Oh, very good.

24:47.869 --> 24:49.029
Thank you.

24:49.204 --> 24:51.104
Thank you, Mr. Tezo.

24:59.714 --> 25:00.738
Hey, doc.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.922
Hey, who's this?

25:41.089 --> 25:43.250
Hey, Filk, it's Ray Tierney.

25:43.425 --> 25:46.724
Yeah. Hey, can you
check something out for me?

25:46.995 --> 25:50.192
That perp who was right inside the door,
the one who had his coat on?

25:50.365 --> 25:53.095
Yeah, see if he got processed
that afternoon.

25:53.735 --> 25:55.396
Yeah.

25:55.870 --> 25:57.531
Hang on.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.576
It's Lupa. L-U-P-A. Sam...

26:02.744 --> 26:04.837
Son of a bitch.

26:05.780 --> 26:09.375
I got water in my bedroom.
Don't ask.

26:09.718 --> 26:12.983
Sammy Lupa. Yeah.
It's not on his sheet, but look at the...

26:13.154 --> 26:14.849
Look at those photos. He's got...

26:15.023 --> 26:17.651
He's got no laces in his shoes,
he's got no belt on.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.226
I mean, what does that say to you?

26:20.528 --> 26:23.190
Well, that's why I thought so.

26:24.065 --> 26:25.930
All right, let me know.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.834
Yeah. Merry Christmas. Bye.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.004
Shit.

27:11.813 --> 27:13.007
Hey.

27:13.181 --> 27:15.308
You weren't gonna knock or anything?

27:16.518 --> 27:18.042
Yeah, I wasn't sure...

27:19.754 --> 27:21.984
I thought you'd be out, anyway.

27:22.157 --> 27:24.682
Figured you were out
doing your last-minute shopping...

27:24.859 --> 27:26.690
...tearing around, you know.

27:26.861 --> 27:30.661
I found that a while ago.
I've been meaning to give it to you.

27:32.434 --> 27:34.334
Thanks.

27:36.504 --> 27:38.028
You gonna go your mom's?

27:38.807 --> 27:41.469
- No, they're coming here.
- Oh.

27:41.776 --> 27:43.573
My sister's in town with the kids.

27:44.779 --> 27:46.770
Good. Good.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.142
I miss them. Give them my love, okay?

27:51.886 --> 27:55.913
You? You going over to your parents'?

27:56.524 --> 27:57.991
No.

27:58.793 --> 28:02.957
We're gonna get everybody
over at Fran and Abby's this year.

28:03.531 --> 28:07.661
Just better. You know?

28:07.836 --> 28:09.133
How is she?

28:11.306 --> 28:12.830
She's the same.

28:13.007 --> 28:14.770
Franny, how's he holding up?

28:14.943 --> 28:16.103
He's okay, I guess.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.311
He doesn't talk that much about it.

28:22.050 --> 28:24.450
But we had a bad couple days.

28:26.888 --> 28:28.685
You heard?

28:29.758 --> 28:31.749
Yeah, I heard.

28:32.927 --> 28:36.863
I know how close you and Lonnie were,
and I'm really sorry, Ray.

28:37.031 --> 28:39.295
Would it have killed you to call me?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.828
- We can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

28:45.006 --> 28:48.100
It's Christmas morning.
You're leaving presents on my stoop. Why?

28:48.276 --> 28:49.800
You're my wife for another month.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.674
I can't leave you a Christmas present?
Are we down to that?

28:52.847 --> 28:55.145
We have tried and we have tried, Ray.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.113
We went over it and we went over it...

28:57.285 --> 28:59.549
...and we keep coming up
against the same wall.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.618
Come on. Come on.

29:01.790 --> 29:05.226
No. No. That's not true.

29:06.494 --> 29:10.123
- Tash, if you knew how much...
- I know.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.930
I feel the same way, Ray.

29:17.505 --> 29:21.737
But I'm doing what I have to do.

29:22.310 --> 29:25.245
This is what I need to do for me.

29:31.152 --> 29:32.744
Okay.

29:37.759 --> 29:40.091
Have a merry Christmas, okay?

29:40.261 --> 29:42.786
Yeah, you too. You too.

29:43.465 --> 29:46.366
Okay. Okay, okay.

29:56.978 --> 29:58.775
Whole thing's fucked.

29:58.947 --> 30:00.244
Tezo's gone with the wind...

30:00.415 --> 30:04.078
...and we're out here doing this shit
on Christmas fucking morning.

30:04.252 --> 30:06.743
Hey, fucko, you forget
four of our guys got killed?

30:08.256 --> 30:11.589
Tezo was out of control. He was dishing
on the street, dealing his shit.

30:11.759 --> 30:14.990
The cocksucker was a fucking liability.

30:15.163 --> 30:17.597
Lived by it, now he's
gonna fucking die by it.

30:17.765 --> 30:19.494
Think Casado's any better?

30:19.667 --> 30:21.430
Casado knows.

30:21.603 --> 30:24.800
Keep it inside, man,
behind closed doors.

30:24.973 --> 30:28.704
Out of sight, out of mind.
And the fucking envelope's on time.

30:28.977 --> 30:30.842
The way it was.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.736
Just the way it was.

30:41.155 --> 30:44.147
You gotta keep your head up.
We're not paying the piper on this.

30:44.325 --> 30:47.317
There's no way.
We're not going to fucking jail. Okay?

30:47.495 --> 30:50.521
Family seeing us behind glass, fuck that.

30:51.366 --> 30:53.231
Fuck that.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.960
Fuck it. Come on.

30:56.137 --> 30:58.697
Let's go pay Pepe a visit.

31:22.196 --> 31:24.824
Let me get a couple AA batteries, bro.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.201
Angel Tezo. You know him, right?

31:28.870 --> 31:30.132
No, I don't.

31:31.039 --> 31:33.234
- Angel Tezo, you know the cocksucker?
- No.

31:33.408 --> 31:35.933
- You don't know Angel Tezo?
- No, I don't.

31:36.444 --> 31:39.641
- Aah!
- Fucking liar.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.078
Try to be a fucking gentleman.
Get on your knees.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.444
Get on your fucking knees!

31:43.618 --> 31:45.142
- Tezo, where is he?
- I don't know.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.949
You think I don't know you're running
drugs here for him, you greasy fuck?

31:49.123 --> 31:51.523
- Angel, you work for him? You feel that?
- Yes, I do.

31:51.693 --> 31:54.127
- You do. Where is he?
- I don't know. I don't know.

31:54.295 --> 31:58.163
You tell me where he is and you live.
- I don't know. I'm telling you, I don't know.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.267
- I know you're hooked up.
- I don't know.

32:00.435 --> 32:01.459
Where?
- I don't know!

32:01.636 --> 32:05.094
I'm gonna put a bullet right in your head.
You're gonna die for that shit.

32:05.273 --> 32:07.673
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna shoot you.

32:07.842 --> 32:10.208
Where the fuck is he? Where is he? One.

32:10.378 --> 32:12.676
I swear to God, I don't know!

32:12.847 --> 32:14.508
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know!

32:14.682 --> 32:15.876
One.
- Eddie!

32:16.050 --> 32:17.711
- He knows where he is!
- I don't know!

32:17.885 --> 32:22.185
- Eddie. Eddie, he doesn't know where he is.
- He fucking knows! Back off! Two. Three!

32:23.658 --> 32:25.523
- Eddie, what the fuck, bro?
- Ha-ha-ha.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.355
I'm fucking with you, man. See? See?

32:28.529 --> 32:29.757
Get up. Get up. Get up.

32:29.931 --> 32:32.627
Look at your fucking nose, bro.
What the fuck?

32:32.800 --> 32:34.791
Tell you what.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.233
I want you to find out
where that motherfucker is.

32:37.405 --> 32:39.873
Hey, we're still friends, right?
We're friends, right?

32:40.041 --> 32:41.065
Let's get out of here.

32:41.242 --> 32:44.109
Tomorrow, I'm gonna have bullets
in my gun, though. All right?

32:44.278 --> 32:47.111
Clean up your nose, man.
<i>Feliz Navidad,</i> brother.

32:47.281 --> 32:48.805
Let's go.

32:51.953 --> 32:53.147
I'm not playing!

32:54.689 --> 32:57.317
Think that's right to do that?
- Yep.

32:57.492 --> 33:00.984
That is not right to do that, Bailey.
I'll have you...

33:01.162 --> 33:04.154
- It is not right to do that.
- I could have you in cuffs.

33:04.332 --> 33:08.132
That's silly. I know what's gonna
happen next, you'll jump me.

33:14.876 --> 33:17.936
- How you doing?
- I'm good to go.

33:18.112 --> 33:19.773
You all right?

33:20.915 --> 33:24.646
- Last chance to slip out the back.
- Not a chance.

33:24.819 --> 33:26.411
All right.

33:26.954 --> 33:29.218
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, that's a good...

33:29.390 --> 33:30.914
Bailey.
- Yeah?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.219
You wanna come help Mo-Mo
bake some Christmas cookies?

33:33.394 --> 33:34.452
Uh-huh.

33:34.629 --> 33:38.326
Oh, good. We got stars, we got snowmen,
we got Santa Clauses...

33:38.499 --> 33:42.663
- If you forfeit the game, you lose.
- I didn't forfeit the game, I won.

33:42.837 --> 33:47.501
And for you, mister, we got no more
of this. Come on, give me the drink.

33:47.675 --> 33:48.937
- No, no.
- Give me the drink.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.737
- You've had enough for a while.
- No.

33:50.912 --> 33:52.243
- You've had enough.
- My dear.

33:52.413 --> 33:53.812
I know.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.400
What have you done?

34:27.181 --> 34:29.342
You gotta open it up to find out.

34:58.045 --> 34:59.273
Is?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.509
Gaelic.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.708
What does it say?

35:04.886 --> 35:08.117
It says <i>"Mo Cion Daonnan."</i>

35:10.358 --> 35:14.761
- What does that mean?
- It means "My love eternal."

35:52.033 --> 35:54.831
They can go. They can eat them.
- You got it, sweetheart?

35:57.338 --> 36:00.171
- Merry Christmas! Hello?
- Hey, Grandma.

36:00.808 --> 36:02.503
Oh, here they come, Mo-Mo.

36:02.677 --> 36:04.645
- Look who's here.
- Aunt Megan! Aunt Megan!

36:04.812 --> 36:06.780
Sorry I'm late.
Uncle Jimmy's got presents.

36:06.948 --> 36:08.609
There he is. There's Pop-Pop.

36:08.783 --> 36:11.411
Can we open presents now?
- Merry Christmas. Not yet.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.644
Merry Christmas, chief.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.583
- Hey, Ma.
- Merry Christmas.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.280
There's my girl. How are you, buddy?

36:17.458 --> 36:18.652
- You get good stuff?
- Yeah.

36:18.826 --> 36:21.192
I heard Santa Claus
comes out of the chimney.

36:21.362 --> 36:23.159
Whoa, it's a ball!

36:23.331 --> 36:24.798
- What is that?
- What about mine?

36:24.966 --> 36:27.799
No opening, not yet. We don't open yet.

36:27.969 --> 36:30.767
- Oh, look who's here.
- Ma, can we open the presents now?

36:30.938 --> 36:33.372
Yes.
- Yeah, presents!

36:33.541 --> 36:35.736
Okay. You can open the presents.

36:35.910 --> 36:38.344
- Hey there.
- Merry Christmas.

36:38.512 --> 36:43.245
Merry Christmas. You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

36:43.417 --> 36:45.317
All right, Christmas time. Presents.

36:45.486 --> 36:47.681
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
You look beautiful.

36:47.855 --> 36:48.879
Thank you so much.

36:49.056 --> 36:51.286
Come on, Dad.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.188
All right, kids. Gifts. Gifts, gifts.

36:53.361 --> 36:56.296
- Hi, handsome.
- Hey.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.125
How you doing?

36:58.299 --> 37:02.759
- I'm okay, you know.
- Yeah? Did you see her?

37:03.037 --> 37:04.868
Yeah, I went by this morning.

37:05.039 --> 37:06.666
And?

37:07.742 --> 37:10.233
It's the same.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.837
- Holy smokes.
- One more.

37:14.015 --> 37:15.141
Rescue gear.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.752
What's going on? Talk to me.
- Nothing. We ain't got shit.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.251
What do you know about Tezo?

37:20.421 --> 37:22.753
He's a lowlife dealer.
He operates a couple blocks.

37:22.924 --> 37:24.858
So you're telling me we're in the clear?

37:25.026 --> 37:27.586
Franny, I was with Jack Gillick
last week at the range...

37:27.762 --> 37:29.525
- He didn't say anything?
- Not a word.

37:29.697 --> 37:30.857
Are you sure about that?

37:31.032 --> 37:33.227
My guys were doing something,
I'd know about it.

37:33.401 --> 37:36.097
- We gotta get this guy.
- Give me a couple days. Let me ask.

37:36.270 --> 37:38.465
- And we'll find out. Trust me.
- All right. Yeah.

37:38.639 --> 37:41.506
Come on, we're missing Christmas.
Come on.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.406
All right, who wants ham?

37:45.046 --> 37:48.072
I need a knife.
- Hot stuff.

37:48.382 --> 37:51.317
Where's?
- Megan, this is...

37:51.485 --> 37:53.976
All right.
- There you are.

37:54.155 --> 37:55.918
Franny.

37:57.091 --> 37:59.559
- Last but not least.
- Oh, potatoes.

37:59.727 --> 38:02.423
They don't want the
Brussels sprouts. That's a little big.

38:02.596 --> 38:03.927
So we got sweet potatoes.

38:04.932 --> 38:06.923
Do these kids need any sweet potatoes?

38:07.101 --> 38:10.537
- Only Monday of next week.
- Monday?

38:10.705 --> 38:14.232
Well, yeah. It wasn't just today, right?
I bring back souvenirs...

38:14.408 --> 38:16.501
Didn't that happen with Jimmy Jr?

38:16.677 --> 38:19.805
We went to the Poconos.
That was the first time we ever took a trip.

38:19.981 --> 38:22.211
I'd like to go on a great vacation.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.509
What are you talking about?

38:26.554 --> 38:29.887
Wait three years and I'll take you
anywhere you want, sweetie pie.

38:38.199 --> 38:39.632
So how you finding being back?

38:41.602 --> 38:45.663
Good. I mean, I wish it was a better
circumstance, but we've got a good team.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.502
- Guys treating you all right?
- I worked with these guys.

38:48.676 --> 38:50.610
- You remember Chris Miller?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:50.778 --> 38:52.973
- I was on some cases with him.
- He's a good guy.

38:53.147 --> 38:55.877
Yeah.
- It's just like riding a bicycle.

38:56.050 --> 38:58.109
You never forget to ride a bicycle.

38:58.285 --> 38:59.411
It's just like him.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.455
Look how happy you made the old man.
It's the best Christmas present.

39:03.624 --> 39:08.391
- Caught a lucky break with that kid.
- There's nothing lucky about it.

39:08.562 --> 39:11.554
You have the instinct for it.
You have the talent for it.

39:11.732 --> 39:14.292
You can see everything
when they're kids.

39:14.468 --> 39:16.368
I could see him when he was a kid.
- Mm-hm.

39:17.071 --> 39:20.438
He was the brains. He was the thinker.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.371
He solved problems.

39:22.543 --> 39:26.172
And that's what he does now as an adult,
he solves problems.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.372
And he was always a leader.

39:29.150 --> 39:31.778
He was a leader of men,
and people listened to Franny.

39:32.353 --> 39:34.583
He has a personality.

39:35.189 --> 39:40.217
He's gonna be a full inspector
before you know it, Abby.

39:40.394 --> 39:44.057
And then there's my little baby girl there.

39:44.398 --> 39:47.731
And she was always just
the way she is right now.

39:47.902 --> 39:50.735
She had a heart
as big as the whole world.

39:52.039 --> 39:53.631
As big as the whole world.

39:53.808 --> 39:58.302
And that's why... That's what she is now.
That's why she's a nurse.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.344
My kids.

40:03.584 --> 40:06.747
That's my kids.
Most important thing in the world.

40:06.921 --> 40:10.379
That's a pretty high bar we set,
me and Mo-Mo, huh?

40:10.558 --> 40:11.991
Pretty high bar we set.

40:12.927 --> 40:15.020
You're okay, old man.

40:15.796 --> 40:17.991
You're not bad yourself.

40:35.049 --> 40:36.641
Shit.

40:37.952 --> 40:39.613
Lisette.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.724
Fuck, man! I fucking...

40:58.706 --> 41:01.004
10-13, 10-13...

41:13.988 --> 41:15.250
Okay, this is what we got.

41:15.422 --> 41:17.287
Number one's got a bullet in the head.

41:17.458 --> 41:19.949
You're looking at an exit wound.
Went out the window.

41:20.127 --> 41:23.961
Number two put his arm up, bullet went
through the arm and into the head.

41:24.131 --> 41:27.498
Number three back here, he's been here
a couple days. He's a little ripe.

41:27.668 --> 41:29.363
Took one to the back of the head.

41:29.537 --> 41:33.166
And we don't really know
where the fuck he fits in just yet.

41:41.715 --> 41:45.742
We're thinking that's the way he took off,
through that fucking window.

41:47.321 --> 41:49.186
You wanna see the witness?

41:49.456 --> 41:50.753
- Yeah.
- Look at me.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.086
She's back here.
- Hey, Lisette.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.524
Now, fuck this
you-don't-understand-me bullshit.

41:55.696 --> 41:57.357
Steve.

41:59.066 --> 42:01.933
Want you to meet Ray Tierney
from the task force.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.036
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey. Ray.

42:04.205 --> 42:05.934
How you doing?

42:06.106 --> 42:08.040
So, what do you got?

42:08.209 --> 42:09.540
Well, she's pretty scattered.

42:09.710 --> 42:12.577
About half a gram of coke, some hypos,
two decks of heroin...

42:12.746 --> 42:14.145
...you know, out of her purse.

42:14.315 --> 42:16.340
- Why he didn't just waste her...
- Yeah.

42:16.517 --> 42:17.541
What'd she say?

42:17.718 --> 42:20.744
Nothing I can understand.
It's all ghetto shit.

42:20.921 --> 42:22.388
- Can I have a few minutes?
- Yeah.

42:22.556 --> 42:24.524
- Get a crack at it?
- Yeah, sure.

42:33.734 --> 42:35.258
Lisette.

43:05.099 --> 43:06.259
Is that your little girl?

43:08.802 --> 43:11.532
You're gonna lose her.
We're gonna bust you for possession.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.969
Child Services is gonna
take her away from you.

43:14.141 --> 43:17.406
Is that what you want to happen?
Is that what you want?

43:17.978 --> 43:19.673
Wait a minute, what is that?

43:20.147 --> 43:22.980
What's this? What is this?

43:26.854 --> 43:28.651
What happened there?

43:29.189 --> 43:31.180
He do that to you?
Did Tezo do that to you?

43:32.526 --> 43:35.461
Did he, Lisette?
Did he put that gun to your head?

43:40.067 --> 43:41.728
What happened?

43:55.482 --> 43:58.747
- Has anybody looked at her?
- There's a bus on its way.

43:59.420 --> 44:02.878
Okay. Look, I wanna help you, okay?

44:03.057 --> 44:05.184
But you gotta give me something.

44:08.762 --> 44:11.230
I know you got something.
Give me something.

44:15.169 --> 44:16.568
Who?

44:17.204 --> 44:19.035
Sandy.

44:23.210 --> 44:25.440
Sandy helped him escape. Who's Sandy?

44:41.362 --> 44:42.852
What?

44:48.569 --> 44:50.901
She talking about us?
- No. Shh. Shh.

44:53.374 --> 44:55.842
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

44:57.644 --> 44:58.975
Sandy's <i>policνa?</i>

44:59.613 --> 45:01.706
Tezo's friend's a cop?

45:08.455 --> 45:10.616
If you're lying to me...

45:10.791 --> 45:13.521
...I'm gonna take your fucking kid
away from you.

45:16.096 --> 45:19.122
She's bugging out.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

45:19.299 --> 45:21.563
I tell you what, do me a favor.

45:21.735 --> 45:24.795
Hold on to her till she gets straight.
I'll meet you at the house.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.496
- All right.
- Nobody talks to her.

45:26.673 --> 45:27.697
- All right.
- Okay?

45:27.875 --> 45:30.173
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

46:15.956 --> 46:19.119
Why does a man choose
to be a police officer?

46:19.293 --> 46:23.957
What kind of man gets up in the morning,
showers, shaves, and goes to work...

46:24.131 --> 46:27.897
...not knowing whether he'll be alive
at the end of the day?

46:28.602 --> 46:33.335
What kind of man has the courage
to stand at the door of the temple...

46:33.507 --> 46:38.945
...and say to those who seek to corrupt,
rob and harm our citizens:

46:39.112 --> 46:43.606
"Not on my watch.
You will not harm one of mine"?

46:44.451 --> 46:46.817
Lonnie Mercer was that kind of man.

46:47.821 --> 46:50.187
As we commit his body to the earth...

46:50.357 --> 46:53.622
...we ask God to take Lonnie's soul
into everlasting light.

46:54.962 --> 46:57.556
May his soul rest in peace.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.596
Amen.

47:05.572 --> 47:08.006
Present arms.

47:41.408 --> 47:42.875
Hey.

47:43.043 --> 47:44.635
Franny.

47:45.812 --> 47:47.541
Hey, Ray.
- Hey.

47:48.682 --> 47:51.116
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.344
- Hey, you did good.
- You think so?

47:53.520 --> 47:55.112
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.984
Yeah.

47:57.524 --> 47:58.821
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

47:58.992 --> 48:03.019
I gotta go home and see Abby and the kids.
Wanna spend the day with them, you know?

48:03.196 --> 48:06.359
Sure, yeah. Listen, I gotta talk to you
about some things.

48:06.533 --> 48:08.467
Okay. What's up?

48:09.236 --> 48:13.434
You and Jimmy coming up with anything
about why your guys were in that building?

48:13.907 --> 48:15.966
No, Ray. They were just
being cops, you know?

48:17.244 --> 48:20.611
Are you sure your guys didn't run
a plant-and-bust on Tezo that day?

48:21.181 --> 48:23.979
It feels like they popped that guy
on nickel-and-dime shit...

48:24.151 --> 48:26.142
...so they could use him on a door knock.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.922
I know these SNEU guys.
They'll go around a warrant doing that.

48:30.090 --> 48:32.115
I need to know
if you were giving them that.

48:32.292 --> 48:35.159
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Did I miss something here?

48:35.329 --> 48:38.594
Did you already catch the scumbag
that killed four of my guys? Did you?

48:38.765 --> 48:39.993
Listen to me. Listen.

48:40.167 --> 48:44.001
We found a cell phone outside
of that apartment. It was Tezo's.

48:44.171 --> 48:47.106
We dumped it. Somebody called him
right before our guys went in.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.609
Now, I checked it against the trace
on that 911 call.

48:50.777 --> 48:53.109
It's the same number, Fran.

48:54.181 --> 48:57.446
And you know where the call came from?
It came from Coney Island.

48:58.685 --> 49:01.483
How are shots fired in Washington Heights
heard in Brooklyn?

49:01.655 --> 49:03.646
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Tell me that.

49:03.824 --> 49:06.622
Half your guys were at that
football game, okay?

49:06.793 --> 49:09.489
If you were gonna pull a sting,
that would be a good time.

49:09.663 --> 49:12.894
Look, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
I'm helping. I'm trying...

49:13.066 --> 49:15.626
Do you wanna help me?
Do you wanna fucking help me?

49:15.802 --> 49:18.066
You find that scumbag
that killed four of my guys.

49:18.238 --> 49:20.001
Yeah. Hey, hey, that's what I'm doing.

49:20.173 --> 49:23.768
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I talked to this broad Lisette.

49:24.077 --> 49:28.309
She says that a friend of his called him
and tipped him that our guys were coming.

49:29.883 --> 49:33.319
She says it was a cop, Franny.
She said, <i>"La policνa."</i>

49:33.487 --> 49:36.115
She said it was someone named Sandy.

49:36.289 --> 49:39.258
You got any cops in your precinct
named Sandy?

49:39.426 --> 49:40.757
No.

49:41.261 --> 49:42.285
No nicknames, nothing?

49:42.462 --> 49:45.727
- I said I don't know anyone named Sandy.
- Okay, okay, listen.

49:45.899 --> 49:48.197
I have not shared this around, Franny.

49:48.368 --> 49:52.361
It is not gonna take peerless detective work
for someone else to connect these dots.

49:52.539 --> 49:54.598
I know you're trying to protect your guys...

49:54.775 --> 49:58.973
...but you gotta get...
- Protect? Protect? They're gone, Raymond.

49:59.312 --> 50:03.112
Freddie, Jack, Billy, Lonnie.
They're all dead.

50:03.283 --> 50:05.683
What the fuck do I gotta
protect them from now, huh?

50:07.754 --> 50:10.188
Fran. I'm trying to protect you.

50:11.158 --> 50:14.924
You know, these questions are gonna come,
Fran. We gotta start dealing with it.

50:17.798 --> 50:20.824
Find fucking Tezo, Ray,
all right? Do me a favor.

50:31.645 --> 50:33.579
Anybody in?

50:33.747 --> 50:35.214
Yeah.

50:39.486 --> 50:41.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:42.022 --> 50:43.580
Come on in.

50:46.059 --> 50:47.686
What happened?

50:49.196 --> 50:52.893
My carpet. What happened to the carpet?

50:53.567 --> 50:57.230
You're supposed to fix the leaks before you
put the carpet down, Pop. You know that?

50:57.404 --> 50:58.666
Oh...

50:59.172 --> 51:02.835
Boats leak, Raymond.
It's the nature of things.

51:05.212 --> 51:06.543
Close the door, will you?

51:12.686 --> 51:14.176
There you go.

51:14.788 --> 51:18.747
- Have a few nips this evening, Pop?
- Had a glass of Scotch, officer.

51:18.925 --> 51:20.017
Just one, huh?

51:20.761 --> 51:22.388
I used the same glass, yeah.

51:24.064 --> 51:26.225
Let me put on a pot of coffee.

51:29.169 --> 51:31.296
Oh, boy.

51:32.606 --> 51:35.040
Got some memories in this tub.

51:35.208 --> 51:37.108
Here. Drink that.

51:39.079 --> 51:41.013
It's nice and warm.

51:43.817 --> 51:45.910
Your brother called me.

51:47.020 --> 51:48.715
Oh, yeah? Did he get something?

51:48.889 --> 51:51.414
Ears to the ground,
but they're getting blanked.

51:53.460 --> 51:55.189
He said you came at him a little bit.

51:57.330 --> 51:59.890
Asking about his boys,
how they were operating.

52:00.066 --> 52:02.899
I ran up against some shit
didn't feel right.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.466
I went to see if Franny and Jimmy
could clear it up for me.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.939
But it didn't file?
You didn't put it down in the fives?

52:10.110 --> 52:12.578
No, I didn't put it in the fives yet.

52:12.746 --> 52:14.213
But some of it, Pop, I gotta.

52:14.381 --> 52:17.214
Raymond, you got
something case-pertinent...

52:17.384 --> 52:20.979
...help us catch this cocksucker,
by all means, share.

52:21.154 --> 52:22.985
But you start looking for loose ends...

52:23.156 --> 52:26.557
...where your brother's boys
are concerned, where's that gonna fall?

52:26.726 --> 52:29.854
You think I'm not thinking about that?
This isn't loose ends.

52:31.097 --> 52:33.895
Pop, I got the shooter's girl saying...

52:34.701 --> 52:37.192
Saying that he got tipped off.

52:37.370 --> 52:39.634
And she says it was a cop
that made the call.

52:44.544 --> 52:46.876
Are you telling me
we're gonna suppress that?

52:47.147 --> 52:48.944
Not suppress, Raymond.

52:49.115 --> 52:52.346
Sit on, for the moment,
anything that might go sideways on us.

52:52.519 --> 52:54.043
Oh, come on. It's the same thing.

52:54.221 --> 52:56.587
You know what position
that's gonna put me in?

52:56.756 --> 52:59.020
Raymond, eight years
as a Major Case narc...

52:59.192 --> 53:02.650
...and you never let something settle
before you put it in print?

53:02.829 --> 53:05.798
Made sure it wasn't gonna come back,
bite you, jam you up?

53:05.966 --> 53:08.491
I'm not looking to jam anybody up,
not intentionally.

53:08.668 --> 53:10.795
Intentionally, unintentionally.
Doesn't matter.

53:10.971 --> 53:13.963
Anything that makes cops look culpable
is no good, Raymond.

53:16.710 --> 53:18.302
What do you want me to do with it?

53:19.012 --> 53:21.344
- You want me to spell it out for you?
- Yeah.

53:21.514 --> 53:25.644
Stay on point. Keep your focus
on finding the fuck who killed our guys.

53:25.819 --> 53:28.151
And if you find anything else
that seems off...

53:28.321 --> 53:32.348
...you come to me
and we deal with it. Okay?

53:32.525 --> 53:34.493
If you say so.

53:37.397 --> 53:39.331
I say so.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.495
Okay.

53:50.343 --> 53:52.243
- Hey, Lou, you still here?
- Yes, boss.

53:52.412 --> 53:55.381
No one goes downstairs.
- You got it, boss.

54:05.292 --> 54:07.089
Hey, Sandy.

54:09.296 --> 54:12.993
Hey, boss.
What are you doing here this late?

54:14.935 --> 54:16.596
Come here.

54:22.375 --> 54:25.037
Hey, guys. Clear it out.

54:25.478 --> 54:28.641
Zach, take it upstairs.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.322
What's up?

54:38.992 --> 54:41.017
I'm gonna ask you this one time, Sandy.

54:41.194 --> 54:42.786
Okay.

54:43.229 --> 54:46.665
And if your first impulse is to lie,
you better fucking resist like hell.

54:46.833 --> 54:48.858
Boss, what are you talking about?

54:50.503 --> 54:52.061
Angel Tezo.

54:53.807 --> 54:55.297
Yeah?

54:56.409 --> 54:59.276
This girl they hauled in
up in the Bronx, Lisette Rivera...

55:00.814 --> 55:02.873
...she was the last one with him.

55:03.249 --> 55:06.980
She said a cop tipped Tezo off
to the Washington Heights raid.

55:07.620 --> 55:10.316
She said this cop
went by the name Sandy.

55:11.091 --> 55:13.753
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

55:14.627 --> 55:16.390
Well, shit, I don't know no...

55:16.563 --> 55:17.723
You set them up to die?

55:17.897 --> 55:19.296
- Your own men!
- I didn't know.

55:19.466 --> 55:23.334
- You let them walk into that?
- I didn't know! Jesus Christ, cap, please.

55:23.503 --> 55:27.132
He was... I've known him since we
were kids. He was my ex-wife's cousin.

55:27.307 --> 55:29.036
You fucking piece of shit!

55:29.209 --> 55:32.667
I told him to get out, they were coming.
I didn't know he'd stay.

55:32.846 --> 55:34.040
You didn't know he'd stay?

55:34.214 --> 55:36.444
I swear, I didn't know
it would end up like that!

55:36.616 --> 55:38.447
What did you think would happen, Sandy?

55:38.618 --> 55:41.849
They were going in there to kill him.
Egan said for them to kill him.

55:42.022 --> 55:43.580
What...? What?

55:43.757 --> 55:45.622
Jimmy? Jimmy Egan said what?

55:45.792 --> 55:48.317
He wanted Tezo dead.
He sent them in there to do him...

55:48.495 --> 55:49.553
...take his money.

55:49.729 --> 55:52.755
Are you fucking telling me Jimmy Egan
was going after drug money?

55:52.932 --> 55:57.096
Kill Tezo, steal his shit,
get into business with Casado.

55:57.270 --> 55:59.329
That was the deal.

56:06.413 --> 56:09.610
You're telling me the fucking SNEU team
was going after drug dealers?

56:09.783 --> 56:13.549
That Jimmy Egan was fucking putting hits
out on people for fucking money?

56:13.720 --> 56:16.018
- That's what you were doing on the street?
- Yeah.

56:16.189 --> 56:18.783
And you dealt with that
by setting up your own crew?

56:18.958 --> 56:20.755
By sending them into a fucking ambush?

56:20.927 --> 56:23.828
You don't call me?
You don't fucking come to me, Sandy?

56:23.997 --> 56:27.023
- I'm your fucking CO!
- I didn't know they'd die.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.931
And I thought you knew.
Everybody knew.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.113
Hey, get out of here.

56:41.281 --> 56:43.044
Get the fuck out of here!

56:54.227 --> 56:56.525
You're done. Tonight.

56:57.263 --> 56:59.493
Turn in your gun, shield, ID card.

56:59.666 --> 57:03.693
And if I see you around here, Sandy,
I will shit-can your pension for good.

57:04.337 --> 57:06.032
This is all I got.

57:08.108 --> 57:10.372
Well, you don't got this anymore.

59:00.053 --> 59:01.680
Fuck!

59:01.854 --> 59:04.823
Aah! Whoo!

59:07.227 --> 59:08.421
Ready?
- Yeah.

59:08.595 --> 59:09.619
Four.
- Hut-hut.

59:09.796 --> 59:10.956
Hike.

59:14.334 --> 59:15.733
There's nothing wrong with...

59:15.902 --> 59:17.961
That means we're gonna have,
what, four kids?

59:18.137 --> 59:21.038
Four kids? I can't afford that shit.
Four kids?

59:21.207 --> 59:22.799
This one.

59:23.343 --> 59:24.401
You think that's fun?

59:24.577 --> 59:27.307
It's definitely time for hot chocolate
and marshmallows.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.811
Do you have ice in your boot?

59:31.384 --> 59:34.376
Okay. There we go, baby. Whoo!

59:35.255 --> 59:37.815
- All right, honey, boots.
- Okay.

59:38.157 --> 59:39.920
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, I'm sorry, pumpkin.

59:40.093 --> 59:41.424
- I'm okay.
Okay.

59:42.762 --> 59:46.528
Oh, who's that?
Who is that? Let's go get the door.

59:50.036 --> 59:51.833
What's up, guy?

59:52.472 --> 59:54.531
Hi there.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Egan.

59:54.707 --> 59:56.334
Is Jimmy home?

59:56.509 --> 59:57.874
Yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?

59:58.044 --> 01:00:00.569
- I'm a old friend of his.
- You're an old friend of his?

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:03.716
Baby, I got it. Jimmy, come here.
Come here. Get inside.

01:00:03.883 --> 01:00:07.319
- Get some hot chocolate. I got it.
- He's an old friend.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.548
What the fuck you doing here,
Casado? Get around back. Now.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.088
Who's that, baby?

01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:17.229
Nobody. He's out of here in five minutes.

01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:20.560
- Where do you know him from?
- From work. He shouldn't be here.

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:22.462
So why is he here?

01:00:22.902 --> 01:00:24.096
I'm gonna get rid of him.

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:26.500
Kiss for me? Rah!

01:00:27.006 --> 01:00:29.338
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

01:00:29.609 --> 01:00:31.201
You too, Mommy.

01:00:31.678 --> 01:00:33.543
Do you have any juice?

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:36.238
Jimmy, Franny's called you
like a thousand times today.

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:39.817
- You gonna call him back or what?
- Yeah, Bobby's going on vacation.

01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:44.184
Probably wants me to cover.
I'll talk to him tonight.

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:54.429
You know how many cops
I got as neighbors, moron?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.760
I figured that.

01:00:55.935 --> 01:00:57.994
What got into your head,
you come to my home?

01:00:58.171 --> 01:01:02.267
Well, I call you on your jack
and it's disconnected.

01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:05.969
You could have caught a tail. They could
have eyes and ears on us right now.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:09.205
Better slow down how you talking to me.
I'll smack fire out you.

01:01:09.382 --> 01:01:11.509
And I don't give a fuck
if you a cop or no cop.

01:01:11.684 --> 01:01:13.879
- Understand me?
- Listen, you fucking cocksucker.

01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:17.511
I don't care how much jack you think
you got, who's backing your play.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:21.285
You come to my house, you try to
press me in front of my kids, my wife...

01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:23.429
...it's a fucking mistake.

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:27.464
- Yeah, laugh, you fucking scumbag.
- You hard as fuck, Jimmy, wow.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.258
But you slipping, J. You slipping.

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:34.895
- Why is this motherfucker still breathing?
- We on a buzzer beater with you?

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:37.065
- Is this a clock?
- Might as well be.

01:01:37.243 --> 01:01:41.043
I give you money,
and this shit ain't handled?

01:01:41.214 --> 01:01:44.115
You fucking with old boy,
you should be fucking with me, Jimmy.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:47.514
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- You glance at a TV lately?

01:01:47.687 --> 01:01:48.813
- Yeah.
- What'd you see?

01:01:48.988 --> 01:01:52.890
Your boys been getting blasted lately,
but I don't give a shit about that.

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:56.620
I just wanna know, are we straight?
Are we straight, Jimmy?

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.161
Did I make the arrangement?

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.933
- Did I take the money?
- You took the money.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.068
- What does that say?
- That don't say shit...

01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:05.932
Listen to me. Listen.
Do not fucking shout in my doghouse.

01:02:06.105 --> 01:02:08.266
- You need to slow the fuck down.
- Listen.

01:02:08.441 --> 01:02:11.376
- Listen to me, you motherfucker. Listen up.
- What you gonna say?

01:02:11.544 --> 01:02:13.671
When he's dead, it's done.

01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:15.876
If I see you come around here again...

01:02:16.048 --> 01:02:19.176
...anywhere near my house,
anywhere near my fucking family...

01:02:19.352 --> 01:02:24.016
...if you even mention a word about my
kids and my wife again, I will kill you.

01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.918
Stop. Give me that.

01:02:33.433 --> 01:02:39.201
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- You fucked up, Jimmy. You fucked up.

01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:45.366
Get that fucking dirty-ass fucking
monkey language out of my fucking yard.

01:02:45.545 --> 01:02:48.605
Get that fucking monkey language out of
my fucking yard.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.249
Don't. Give me it.

01:02:56.422 --> 01:02:58.856
Say goodbye to the family for me, okay?

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.529
Kenny.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.028
I'm in here, baby.

01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:48.064
Yeah, okay. Hold on.

01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:54.279
Okay. I'll be right there.

01:03:54.447 --> 01:03:56.881
- Hey, Jimmy, what's up?
<i>Where the fuck is everybody?</i>

01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:59.540
<i>Calling Eddie, Sandy.</i>
<i>No one's picking up.</i>

01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:02.483
Eddie's sleeping off Christmas.
I don't know where Sandy is.

01:04:02.655 --> 01:04:07.115
<i>I got some intel from a guy in Heida.</i>
<i>You remember Coco Dominguez?</i>

01:04:07.293 --> 01:04:11.821
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tezo's lieutenant.
- <i>Yeah, Tezo's lieutenant. He fucked up.</i>

01:04:11.998 --> 01:04:15.525
<i>Back in town from the D.R.</i>
<i>He came in to see his kids for the holidays.</i>

01:04:15.701 --> 01:04:17.931
<i>He's not gonna give him up.</i>

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.696
<i>No way Coco's gonna talk, Jimmy.</i>

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:24.771
Hey, Coco.

01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:30.210
- Where is he?
- Get down. Get the kids down.

01:04:30.383 --> 01:04:32.783
- He gone, you motherfucker. Gone.
- Gone where, Coco?

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.547
Gone, nigga. Now, do your fucking job
and find him, motherfucker.

01:04:45.197 --> 01:04:48.633
If you let me get out of this shit,
I'm gonna come back and stab you... Aah!

01:04:49.235 --> 01:04:52.671
- Deranged motherfucker.
- You're gonna tell me where he is.

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:55.306
- You're gonna tell me.
- I'll tell you where he is.

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:57.965
I'll tell you.
He's up your mama's ass, bitch!

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.203
Please.
- Angelique, put the boy back!

01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:03.246
Angelique, put the boy back in!
Push that nigga back!

01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:07.079
Angelique, get the boy back in the room
now! Push that nigga back, Angelique!

01:05:07.253 --> 01:05:09.847
Angelique, get the boy back in!
Put the baby back in!

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:12.115
- Put the baby back in the room!
- Ugh!

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.991
Shut up. Do you understand me?
You speak English?

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:22.225
Shut up! Shut your fucking...
Shut your mouth. Shut it.

01:05:25.371 --> 01:05:28.033
Still up my mother's ass? Huh?

01:05:29.442 --> 01:05:31.103
Talk to me.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.943
Kenny, put in a call to ACS.

01:05:36.716 --> 01:05:40.379
Tell them they gotta take an infant.
First-degree burns over most of its body.

01:05:40.553 --> 01:05:44.182
- Tell them the baby's face is disfigured.
- Sure thing, Jimmy.

01:05:45.257 --> 01:05:47.316
Use your phone, <i>muchacho?</i> Hm?

01:05:57.169 --> 01:05:58.261
Angel Tezo.

01:05:59.672 --> 01:06:02.869
Fuck you, Jimmy. Kiss my fucking ass.

01:06:06.912 --> 01:06:09.813
Wait, wait! He's up in Morrisania
in the Bronx at the bitch's place.

01:06:09.982 --> 01:06:12.746
- Where? Where? You talk to him?
- At his bitch's place.

01:06:12.918 --> 01:06:14.215
- Who? Who?
- Esther, Esther!

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:18.824
Esther fucking what?
You better fucking tell me! Esther what?

01:06:18.991 --> 01:06:20.151
You tell him where he is!

01:06:20.326 --> 01:06:22.556
- Esther fucking what?
- Kane. Kane, nigga! Kane!

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:27.222
Esther-motherfucking-Kane, nigga!
Now, put the baby down, nigga!

01:06:31.537 --> 01:06:33.198
Please.
- Come here. You're okay.

01:06:33.372 --> 01:06:35.966
Oh, no! Please, please, officer.

01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.173
- Oh, God.
- He's beautiful.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.252
You breathe a word of this,
and I come back here.

01:06:58.698 --> 01:07:02.532
I'll slit your throat, fuck your wife
and kill your kid.

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:04.326
Look at me.

01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:07.597
You tip Angel off,
I'll make it even worse.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.570
I'll send an ambulance over.

01:07:45.578 --> 01:07:47.409
Oh, shit.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.741
Go, go, go!

01:07:57.389 --> 01:07:58.754
Hey, Took.

01:07:58.924 --> 01:08:01.688
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, come on. Leave me alone, bro!

01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:04.329
- Come on, Took.
- I didn't do nothing.

01:08:05.297 --> 01:08:07.595
- Where you going?
- Leave me alone, yo!

01:08:07.767 --> 01:08:09.826
Come here, dipshit. Come here.
- Come on.

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:12.766
You run on me? You running
from me? Get up against the wall.

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:14.200
- All right!
- Shut up.

01:08:14.373 --> 01:08:16.000
- All right.
- You got a demo in here?

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.939
- If I cut my hand, I'm gonna get...
- In my pocket. My pocket.

01:08:19.111 --> 01:08:22.308
- What pocket?
- The other pocket, bro. The other one.

01:08:22.481 --> 01:08:25.973
You been smoking too much of this
devil's shit. It's messing with your mind.

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:28.416
Your friend come to check up on you,
you bug out?

01:08:28.587 --> 01:08:30.919
I haven't seen you in a long time.
What you expect?

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:33.957
I just came to talk.
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

01:08:34.126 --> 01:08:36.526
- You chill? You gonna chill out?
- I'm chill, B.

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:39.425
- Okay, you don't look chill.
- I'm chill, yo. I'm chill.

01:08:39.598 --> 01:08:41.292
What you expect, bro?
You scared me, man.

01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:44.493
Whoa! What is this, the fucking airport?
Give it over. Give it.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:46.934
What do you want from me?
- You know how it works.

01:08:47.106 --> 01:08:49.540
Come on. We help each other out,
just like old times.

01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:50.732
- Okay?
- Why?

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:53.310
Give me some good skank,
I'll give you your cook-up.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:55.207
- What?
- Okay? I want Angel Tezo.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:58.042
You and every other cop in the city's
asking that shit, B.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:01.277
- I don't know shit, B.
- Oh, yeah? You weren't steering for him?

01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:03.921
Getting cracked out with his cousin?
Don't shine me.

01:09:04.089 --> 01:09:07.889
I swear on everything I love, yo.
He'll smoke me if I talk to you, yo. Chill.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.188
If I pop you for this, you're dodging
dicks in Rikers before Friday.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.523
- Come on.
- Take your pick.

01:09:12.698 --> 01:09:14.221
- Give me my shit.
- Want your shit?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.527
- I pick my shit. Come on.
- Want your shit?

01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:18.169
No, stop.
- There's your shit.

01:09:18.337 --> 01:09:20.965
Stop playing, Tierney! Man!
Tierney, come on, yo.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.233
- What is this, a charity I'm running?
- No, no.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.741
We're here to trade.
You gotta sell me something.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.435
- Nothing?
- No, no, no!

01:09:28.613 --> 01:09:30.377
- No!
- Too bad. Last one.

01:09:30.549 --> 01:09:32.608
- Stop playing. Chill. No.
- A little bit.

01:09:32.785 --> 01:09:34.446
- Come on, please.
- What do you think?

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.712
- What do you think? Got something?
- All right.

01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:38.720
Where's he at? Who's helping him?

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:41.654
No, Ray, no, no, last one. All right.
All right. All right.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:50.993
Miller, I got a line on Tezo.
I got a line on Tezo. Send backup.

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:55.266
I'm on my way there right now.
433 Central Avenue, Morrisania.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.740
Yeah, no, I know. I know,
but we missed it. We missed it, okay?

01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:02.369
Just... I'll see you there.
I'll explain it there.

01:10:10.389 --> 01:10:12.084
Come on.

01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:37.732
Audubon 6 to Central,
I got shots fired. Shots fired.

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:41.175
433 Central Avenue in the Bronx.
I need backup.

01:11:48.087 --> 01:11:51.056
I'm going in. I need backup forthwith.

01:12:19.184 --> 01:12:20.913
Shit.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:39.866
Go away.

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.840
Get him up, man!

01:12:48.013 --> 01:12:50.641
Pig! Get the fuck off me!

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:53.880
Fuck you!

01:13:02.094 --> 01:13:04.085
Open his fucking mouth.

01:13:12.404 --> 01:13:14.269
Give me something.

01:13:15.674 --> 01:13:16.698
Give me something.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:17.933
Fucking answer.

01:13:20.712 --> 01:13:23.010
I want a fucking name.

01:13:27.352 --> 01:13:28.910
Sandy.

01:13:29.088 --> 01:13:30.851
Finish him.

01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:33.417
Jimmy.

01:13:34.259 --> 01:13:35.624
Hey, no, no! It's Ray!

01:13:35.794 --> 01:13:38.922
- Ray? Ray, we got him.
- Jimmy, what the fuck is going on here?

01:13:39.098 --> 01:13:40.122
- We got him.
- What?

01:13:40.299 --> 01:13:42.699
- We got him.
- What are you guys even doing here?

01:13:42.868 --> 01:13:44.392
- What is he...?
- It's handled, Ray.

01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:47.130
What do you mean, it's handled?
What are you...? Come on!

01:13:47.306 --> 01:13:49.035
Hey. Enough. Enough.

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:50.732
- Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:52.672
- Don't fucking take it out!
- Hey, hey.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.369
- Motherfucker.
- Don't take it out.

01:13:54.546 --> 01:13:56.946
- Take your hands off of me.
- Ray, put the gun away.

01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.016
Put your hand on me again, asshole.

01:14:04.256 --> 01:14:05.985
Oh, my God.

01:14:06.158 --> 01:14:09.753
- Fuck him, he's done.
- He's not done. He's alive.

01:14:12.631 --> 01:14:14.360
Jesus.

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:17.165
Jesus.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.230
He's dead.

01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:25.433
Jimmy.

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:29.772
Good work, Ray.

01:14:30.249 --> 01:14:31.944
Good work.

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:42.351
You motherfucker! You motherfucker!
What the fuck are you thinking?

01:14:42.528 --> 01:14:44.257
- Get back.
- Have you lost your mind?

01:14:44.429 --> 01:14:45.896
Ray.

01:14:48.433 --> 01:14:52.699
I fucking love you, Ray.
You know I do. You're family.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.806
Your backup's coming.

01:14:56.108 --> 01:14:57.803
So here's what happened.

01:14:57.976 --> 01:15:00.843
Now, you got here first. He resisted.

01:15:01.613 --> 01:15:03.740
You had to put three in him.

01:15:04.716 --> 01:15:05.978
It was a clean shoot.

01:15:07.219 --> 01:15:10.780
- You have lost your fucking mind.
- You're a cop, Ray.

01:15:11.056 --> 01:15:12.387
Just like us.

01:15:12.858 --> 01:15:14.951
You're a fucking cop.

01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:21.090
- Get your fucking hands off me. Get off me.
- Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.631
He knows what he's
gotta do here, right, Jimmy?

01:15:24.503 --> 01:15:26.403
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

01:15:42.554 --> 01:15:44.852
You talk to him?
- No. Look, Ray...

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:48.857
- What are you doing here? Talk to him.
- Calm down. We're gonna figure this out.

01:15:49.027 --> 01:15:52.292
Was there static on the line?
Did you hear what I fucking said?

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:57.094
Jimmy executed him. He took my fucking
gun off me, Francis, and shot him.

01:15:57.269 --> 01:15:59.965
What the fuck is going on here?
Did you send him in there?

01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:03.301
- What did you know? Were you in on this?
- No, I didn't know, Ray.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:04.635
You didn't know like
you didn't know about Sandy?

01:16:06.699 --> 01:16:10.726
I come to you and I asked you if you had
a cop in your precinct named Sandy.

01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:13.395
A nickname, I said.
Tell me you weren't lying to me.

01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:16.440
I needed to find out for myself.
You've been gone a long time.

01:16:16.609 --> 01:16:19.544
Come on.
I came to you to try to help you.

01:16:19.712 --> 01:16:23.671
Do you have any idea what Jimmy's been
doing under your roof? Do you even care?

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.181
I'm doing my best. All right?

01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:29.048
I'm in the hospital all day with my wife,
who's fucking dying.

01:16:31.624 --> 01:16:35.116
Look, I know Jimmy's out of control.
Believe me, I'm gonna take care of him.

01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:38.423
But you and I, we gotta keep
our heads up here, Ray.

01:16:38.598 --> 01:16:41.294
We gotta handle this so no one else
gets hurt. You hear me?

01:16:41.468 --> 01:16:42.765
We're not gonna handle this.

01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:46.372
What do you think? You think we're
gonna go with Pop and smooth this over?

01:16:46.539 --> 01:16:50.031
That is not gonna happen. This isn't
Mott Haven. I won't stand up for that.

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:53.145
You know, it's not Mott Haven.
This is not about the department.

01:16:53.313 --> 01:16:57.773
This is about me. My command.
All this shit falls on me, Ray.

01:16:57.951 --> 01:17:01.409
So, what do you wanna do? You wanna
cut me off at the fucking knees?

01:17:01.588 --> 01:17:03.488
You wanna watch me go down in flames?

01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:06.489
Is that gonna satisfy your sense
of right and wrong?

01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:09.557
We got an out here, Ray.

01:17:12.665 --> 01:17:14.997
Jesus, Francis.

01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:21.633
I know this is fucked up, okay?

01:17:21.808 --> 01:17:23.776
But I need you.

01:17:26.079 --> 01:17:28.673
This is fucking you and me.

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:33.610
When we were kids,
all we ever talked about was being cops.

01:17:34.487 --> 01:17:38.287
How the fuck did we end up at this?

01:17:45.565 --> 01:17:47.590
What are you gonna do, Ray?

01:17:49.602 --> 01:17:51.160
I don't know.

01:17:52.138 --> 01:17:55.039
I don't know.
I'm gonna get this fucking blood off me.

01:17:56.342 --> 01:17:57.866
Ray.

01:18:14.394 --> 01:18:17.795
<i>You were gone a long time.</i>
<i>Where were you?</i>

01:18:17.964 --> 01:18:19.431
Uh...

01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:21.824
I just...

01:18:22.702 --> 01:18:25.432
I just had to talk to Ray
about something.

01:18:25.939 --> 01:18:27.930
What is it, Francis?

01:18:28.107 --> 01:18:30.268
Is everything okay?

01:18:34.714 --> 01:18:36.944
You know, Ab, it's not.

01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:39.645
What's going on?

01:18:42.488 --> 01:18:44.479
Oh, fuck, Abby.

01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:48.058
Oh, Francis, talk to me.

01:18:48.227 --> 01:18:51.788
I mean, don't not tell me
something which is...

01:18:55.168 --> 01:18:57.102
Because...

01:19:01.874 --> 01:19:04.104
Those men, Abby.

01:19:06.546 --> 01:19:08.741
Those four cops.

01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:13.945
I am right in the middle of something...

01:19:15.588 --> 01:19:18.216
...and I don't know
how to get out of it.

01:19:21.327 --> 01:19:24.524
And I am really fucking scared.

01:19:39.879 --> 01:19:41.642
Can...

01:19:42.448 --> 01:19:44.382
...you see how to...

01:19:46.352 --> 01:19:48.616
...make it right?

01:19:54.394 --> 01:19:56.123
Not without...

01:19:57.797 --> 01:20:04.361
Not without ruining everything
I've been working for.

01:20:07.674 --> 01:20:10.165
You're a good man, Francis.

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:12.578
I don't know how...

01:20:13.046 --> 01:20:14.570
How...

01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:18.310
How you got yourself...

01:20:21.387 --> 01:20:24.948
I trust you with my children.

01:20:25.425 --> 01:20:29.452
I need you to be that man.

01:20:33.933 --> 01:20:36.299
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:20:37.904 --> 01:20:39.394
Yeah.

01:20:49.515 --> 01:20:51.813
I got your back, Abby.

01:20:54.454 --> 01:20:56.979
<i>A neighbor says she saw</i>
<i>three men she can't identify...</i>

01:20:57.156 --> 01:21:00.614
...get out of a yellow, possibly gold,
'80s Monte Carlo or Grand Prix...

01:21:00.793 --> 01:21:04.160
...and enter the building where
Angel Tezo was later found shot dead.

01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:06.389
EMT on the scene confirmed,
off the record...

01:21:06.566 --> 01:21:09.000
...that the victim suffered
a crushed larynx.

01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:12.103
- At the coroner's office...
- Hey, Carlos, you have a call on one.

01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:13.295
Who is it?
- Won't say.

01:21:13.473 --> 01:21:15.407
<i>killed after exchanging gunfire with...</i>

01:21:15.575 --> 01:21:19.409
The coroner's office has yet
to release a copy of the autopsy report...

01:21:19.579 --> 01:21:21.774
...nor have they returned
any of my phone calls.

01:21:21.948 --> 01:21:24.576
WOMAN responsible for the
<i>slaying of four New York City cops.</i>

01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:25.945
Hey, guys.
- Bragon.

01:21:26.119 --> 01:21:28.849
WOMAN Tezo shooting,
<i>whose names are withheld at present...</i>

01:21:29.021 --> 01:21:32.821
- <i>... are being hailed</i> as...
- Do I know...? Hey, who is this?

01:21:35.695 --> 01:21:39.654
All right. Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

01:21:39.999 --> 01:21:43.230
All right. You have to give me some...

01:21:43.402 --> 01:21:45.461
You have to give me something small.

01:21:49.642 --> 01:21:51.075
Uh-huh.

01:21:56.182 --> 01:21:59.674
Okay. And, look, I'm gonna need a name.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.633
Are you alone?

01:22:48.801 --> 01:22:50.792
Yeah.
- Don't fuck with me, man.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:54.929
- I swear to God, don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man. I'm being straight.

01:22:55.107 --> 01:22:57.735
Nobody knows I'm here,
nobody knows you're here.

01:23:03.549 --> 01:23:05.540
You recording this?

01:23:05.985 --> 01:23:07.543
Do you want me to?

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.846
You got a recorder?

01:23:09.021 --> 01:23:10.045
No.

01:23:11.724 --> 01:23:14.352
Then I don't want you to record it.

01:23:14.627 --> 01:23:16.060
Okay.

01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:21.323
All right, look, you could just...
You just talk, all right?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.628
Tell me anything you wanna say,
I won't interrupt you. Say whatever.

01:23:24.804 --> 01:23:27.534
So you can get my story, right?
So you can fuck me.

01:23:27.707 --> 01:23:30.904
- Turn my name to shit, is that it?
- Hey, Sandy. You called me.

01:23:31.077 --> 01:23:33.568
I'm not a priest, I'm a writer.

01:23:34.747 --> 01:23:39.411
I came down here to freeze my ass off
sitting in this fucking car. I did my part.

01:23:42.855 --> 01:23:45.483
I gotta get this out of me.

01:23:47.026 --> 01:23:49.961
- I gotta get this out.
- What?

01:23:50.563 --> 01:23:52.531
We're all dirty.

01:23:54.066 --> 01:23:58.264
We sold our shields off,
highest bidder, murder for hire.

01:24:00.039 --> 01:24:04.203
Stole drugs off dead men, planted shit...

01:24:05.544 --> 01:24:06.636
...beat suspects.

01:24:06.812 --> 01:24:09.747
We robbed and...

01:24:16.756 --> 01:24:20.658
We condemned four of our own to die.

01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:24.025
- What are you talking about?
- Washington Heights.

01:24:24.931 --> 01:24:27.229
We sent them into a slaughter.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.360
- Who? Who, Sandy? Who sent those men?
- I fucking told you, no names!

01:24:32.538 --> 01:24:35.598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:24:38.277 --> 01:24:40.507
I can't undo it now.

01:24:41.447 --> 01:24:43.608
There's no atoning.

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:47.318
I'm gonna burn, man.
I'm gonna fucking burn.

01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:49.920
No, no, no. No, this is...
We can work this out, okay?

01:24:50.089 --> 01:24:53.286
No, no, no.
- Look, I'm gonna call my city desk.

01:24:53.459 --> 01:24:55.893
All right? I'm gonna call my editor.
All right?

01:24:56.062 --> 01:24:59.031
To save space for your story, okay?
Your story.

01:25:00.232 --> 01:25:01.756
Okay?

01:25:03.302 --> 01:25:05.270
Becoming a cop...

01:25:08.174 --> 01:25:10.642
...the respect that earned us...

01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:16.274
...the pledge we took...

01:25:17.483 --> 01:25:20.213
...to uphold something honest...

01:25:20.953 --> 01:25:25.185
Being in the blue, wearing that shield...

01:25:29.795 --> 01:25:32.263
...the pride that I felt...

01:25:34.633 --> 01:25:36.726
...the fucking glory...

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.400
We let it all go out from under us.

01:25:52.218 --> 01:25:54.550
I was a good man once.

01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:53.703
Who is it?

01:26:53.879 --> 01:26:55.346
It's Kenny.

01:26:55.514 --> 01:26:56.879
What does he want?

01:26:57.049 --> 01:26:59.711
I just got up.
How the fuck should I know?

01:27:03.355 --> 01:27:05.721
Jesus Christ.

01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:11.354
We're about to get fucked.

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:13.225
He's dead. Jimmy, he's fucking dead.

01:27:13.399 --> 01:27:14.923
Sandy fucking killed himself.

01:27:15.101 --> 01:27:16.830
Shh. Come on.

01:27:17.002 --> 01:27:18.128
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:27:18.938 --> 01:27:22.271
...it is with sorrow
and a deep sense of regret...

01:27:22.441 --> 01:27:25.137
...that I appear before you today.

01:27:26.212 --> 01:27:27.975
At 10:30 p.m. last night...

01:27:28.414 --> 01:27:33.010
...Officer Ruben Santiago of the
31 st Precinct in Washington Heights...

01:27:33.752 --> 01:27:35.310
...took his own life.

01:27:35.488 --> 01:27:37.820
Officer Santiago...

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:41.949
...along with the four officers slain
in Washington Heights...

01:27:42.128 --> 01:27:45.495
...had formed an illicit criminal cabal.

01:27:45.664 --> 01:27:49.225
Working in collusion
and under the aegis of the N.Y.P. D...

01:27:49.401 --> 01:27:53.360
...these officers undertook all manner
of criminal misdeed.

01:27:53.539 --> 01:27:56.736
Investigators from Internal Affairs
have isolated the involvement...

01:27:56.909 --> 01:27:59.469
Where the hell have you been?
- of this rogue unit...

01:27:59.645 --> 01:28:01.840
...to the deceased men.
- Yeah, we need to talk.

01:28:02.014 --> 01:28:05.506
- No other officer in 31 st Precinct...
- Yeah, okay. Tonight.

01:28:05.684 --> 01:28:07.879
...has been found culpable of...
- You be there.

01:28:08.053 --> 01:28:11.045
...or in any way linked
to this criminal conspiracy.

01:28:11.223 --> 01:28:13.020
Francis.

01:28:15.327 --> 01:28:17.158
Francis.

01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:19.620
What the hell is going on here?

01:28:19.798 --> 01:28:23.734
- I can't talk, Pop, I gotta go.
- What the hell is going on here, Francis?

01:28:24.069 --> 01:28:26.230
How involved are you?

01:28:27.873 --> 01:28:29.465
Look at me.

01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:31.405
Look at me.

01:28:35.214 --> 01:28:36.909
Did you know what they were doing?

01:28:38.017 --> 01:28:39.951
I knew enough.

01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:48.219
Dad, come on, man. All those years,
you never got jammed up?

01:28:48.394 --> 01:28:51.454
- It never came down on top of you?
- No.

01:28:51.964 --> 01:28:53.397
Because I kept my head up.

01:28:53.566 --> 01:28:56.228
All I took was a check cut by the city.
That's all I took.

01:28:56.402 --> 01:28:58.870
I didn't take any money.
I didn't take a fucking cent.

01:28:59.038 --> 01:29:02.166
Then what? What did you do?

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.211
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- Francis, sit down. Let's talk.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.781
- I'm here to help you, Franny.
- I can't do this now, Pop. I gotta go.

01:29:11.951 --> 01:29:15.751
I gotta do this my way, all right?
I'm sorry.

01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:35.586
Happy New Year!

01:29:50.136 --> 01:29:53.230
Happy fucking New Year!

01:29:54.273 --> 01:29:55.968
Taxi!

01:30:08.621 --> 01:30:10.316
Thanks.

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:32.034
Fuck!

01:30:32.211 --> 01:30:33.940
Move, I'll break it off.

01:30:34.113 --> 01:30:35.239
Who are you?

01:30:35.415 --> 01:30:38.248
Bragon, Carlos Bragon.
I'm a reporter, for chrissake!

01:30:39.052 --> 01:30:41.885
- You know me, Tierney.
- Shut up, shut up!

01:30:42.055 --> 01:30:44.649
You know me, Tierney. You know me.

01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:48.224
Yeah, I know you, you fucking hack.

01:30:48.394 --> 01:30:51.488
What the fuck are you doing following me?
What do you want?

01:30:51.964 --> 01:30:53.727
I'm writing a story.

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:56.835
I got two versions,
I wanna run them by you.

01:30:57.003 --> 01:30:58.800
First one goes like this:

01:30:58.971 --> 01:31:02.566
Hero detective captures cop killer.
Kills him in self-defense.

01:31:02.742 --> 01:31:04.369
Yeah, what else?

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:07.570
The other one is key witness
in a cop-corruption case...

01:31:07.747 --> 01:31:11.148
...dies mysteriously in the presence
of cops from the 31 st Precinct.

01:31:11.317 --> 01:31:14.115
- Which one sounds better?
- Whatever sells more papers, right?

01:31:14.287 --> 01:31:17.222
Yeah, I know cops from the 31
were there before you, Ray.

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:19.483
That's your brother's house, isn't it?

01:31:21.794 --> 01:31:26.788
Sources are telling me that Angel Tezo
was tortured and was executed.

01:31:26.966 --> 01:31:30.299
He had half his teeth shoved down
to his belly, splinters in his throat.

01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:33.234
- You carry a stick?
- Keep pushing me, you're gonna find out.

01:31:33.406 --> 01:31:37.069
I'm trying to help you. Be smart.

01:31:37.744 --> 01:31:39.712
I can be writing a story
about Ray Tierney.

01:31:39.879 --> 01:31:41.972
But I should be writing a story
about the 31.

01:31:45.351 --> 01:31:48.582
You were there. Here's your opportunity
to set it straight right now.

01:31:48.888 --> 01:31:51.152
I don't like my odds with you.

01:31:51.457 --> 01:31:53.982
Last cop you talked to
blew his brains out in your car.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.254
Last time I saw you, you were
feeding bullshit to the grand jury.

01:31:57.430 --> 01:32:00.888
I was only sitting there
because of your hard-on to crucify cops.

01:32:01.067 --> 01:32:04.127
I do. Because they were protecting
their own and burying the truth.

01:32:04.303 --> 01:32:08.296
Don't talk to me about the truth. You got
no idea what it takes to do what we do.

01:32:08.474 --> 01:32:10.806
- You weren't there.
- You wanna know what I know?

01:32:10.977 --> 01:32:13.411
I know you took a bullet in the face
during the raid.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:17.179
I know Kareem Aldovise, a 19-year-old
kid, went off that roof and died.

01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:18.374
Everybody knows that.

01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:21.782
Yeah, and I know a witness
saw him surrender before they did it.

01:32:22.488 --> 01:32:25.457
He had no priors, he had no gun.

01:32:26.425 --> 01:32:29.326
You wanna bullshit the grand jury, fine.
Don't do it to me.

01:32:29.495 --> 01:32:33.431
Well, in case you didn't hear, they cleared
us two years ago, okay? Case closed.

01:32:33.599 --> 01:32:37.035
So don't get in my face because you're
skeeved about losing your Pulitzer.

01:32:37.203 --> 01:32:39.296
But you know what?
I don't really think about it that much.

01:32:51.684 --> 01:32:54.653
Wake up, all right? Come on.

01:32:59.492 --> 01:33:01.119
Jimmy!

01:33:01.294 --> 01:33:02.727
Jimmy!

01:33:02.895 --> 01:33:04.157
Help.

01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:06.764
Help me, Jimmy.

01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:19.639
Hey, boss.

01:33:21.247 --> 01:33:22.305
Where is he?

01:33:59.151 --> 01:34:01.676
Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:34:02.154 --> 01:34:06.750
Mayor goes on TV, moans the loss, gives us
a clean bill of health. What's the problem?

01:34:06.926 --> 01:34:10.191
I asked you point-blank, "Were you
involved in this?" What did you say?

01:34:10.363 --> 01:34:11.921
I said what you wanted to hear.

01:34:12.098 --> 01:34:14.566
- I wanted the fucking truth.
- What truth?

01:34:14.734 --> 01:34:18.966
Truth about the money we were getting?
The dirty cops you preside over?

01:34:19.138 --> 01:34:21.606
You knew. All you cared about
was your promotion.

01:34:21.774 --> 01:34:23.639
- I knew what was fucking going on?
- Yeah.

01:34:23.809 --> 01:34:26.801
I gave you room to get the job done.
If you took a little here...

01:34:26.979 --> 01:34:29.106
...I wasn't looking.
But you crossed the line.

01:34:29.282 --> 01:34:32.479
What, you think because you didn't
take an envelope, it absolves you?

01:34:32.652 --> 01:34:34.882
Silk hat, same pig.

01:34:35.054 --> 01:34:37.716
Crimes down, collars up.
It's what you wanted.

01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:40.324
End justifies the means, buddy boy.

01:34:40.493 --> 01:34:42.893
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

01:34:43.062 --> 01:34:47.590
You think you can set Ray up for this?
You are dead fucking wrong.

01:34:47.767 --> 01:34:51.066
We took you in.
You were a fucking brother to us.

01:34:51.237 --> 01:34:54.729
My sister's your wife, your family's my
family, and you jam us up like this?

01:34:54.907 --> 01:34:58.570
I jam you? I saved you. It's a lay-up, Fran.

01:34:58.744 --> 01:35:01.076
Oh, yeah? How's that, Jimmy?
Run that by me.

01:35:01.247 --> 01:35:04.182
- Ray sticks to the story, he's a hero.
- That's not gonna happen.

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:07.046
- You're gonna make this right, or I swear...
- Or what?

01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:09.653
What the fuck are you gonna do, Franny?

01:35:09.822 --> 01:35:13.622
You gonna burn down your own house?
Blow up everything you worked for?

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.223
All Ray's gotta do is walk into IAB...

01:35:16.395 --> 01:35:19.762
...say what needs to be said,
end of fucking story.

01:35:19.932 --> 01:35:23.265
- We go home, we go to sleep at night.
- You think this ends that simply?

01:35:23.436 --> 01:35:27.372
We all go to sleep at night. Let me tell you,
what we've done does not get forgiven.

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.974
Here we go with the
Sister Mary Margarets.

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:31.871
Someone says you're dirty, who cares?

01:35:32.044 --> 01:35:34.239
They say you're fucking corrupt.
Fuck them.

01:35:34.413 --> 01:35:36.404
Do they know how these animals live?

01:35:36.582 --> 01:35:39.050
We tour the sewers, Franny!

01:35:39.218 --> 01:35:42.244
I will not apologize for doing what I do.
I earn 65 grand a year.

01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:46.380
Some fuck like Tezo wipes his ass
with that shit in a week.

01:35:47.994 --> 01:35:50.224
We're in this together, Franny.

01:35:51.063 --> 01:35:54.430
- What the fuck is that?
- It's your cut. I've been keeping it for you.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:57.130
Take the fucking money, Franny.

01:35:59.071 --> 01:36:00.902
Take the fucking money, Franny.

01:36:01.974 --> 01:36:04.135
You were my brother, Jimmy.

01:36:04.577 --> 01:36:07.068
Franny. Take...

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.320
Fuck.

01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:44.182
Yeah, Tierney.

01:36:47.386 --> 01:36:50.014
Whoa, whoa, whoa. IAB?

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:57.252
Well, no, no,
but I thought I'd have some time.

01:36:59.465 --> 01:37:01.660
<i>Detective, let me start</i>
<i>by saying we're aware...</i>

01:37:01.834 --> 01:37:04.564
<i>... of your outstanding service record...</i>

01:37:04.737 --> 01:37:07.604
<i>... and we wanna thank you</i>
<i>for your role in solving this case.</i>

01:37:07.773 --> 01:37:11.004
<i>We're gonna make this as brief as possible,</i>
<i>gonna get you out of here.</i>

01:37:11.177 --> 01:37:15.341
<i>We need a statement detailing</i>
<i>your participation in the incident on record.</i>

01:37:15.514 --> 01:37:19.041
<i>Now, you declined to give a
<i>statement at the scene of the shooting.</i></i>

01:37:19.218 --> 01:37:21.482
- <i>Is that correct?</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

01:37:21.654 --> 01:37:25.750
Mr. Tezo was tried and sentenced
in a bathroom in the Bronx.

01:37:26.225 --> 01:37:28.159
<i>But you're prepared to give us one now?</i>

01:37:28.327 --> 01:37:29.658
Far removed from a jury.

01:37:29.829 --> 01:37:32.093
- Far removed from a judge.
- <i>I'm gonna do my best.</i>

01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:36.496
<i>Far removed from our basic rights</i>
<i>endowed on all men by our Constitution.</i>

01:37:36.936 --> 01:37:38.597
This march will commence at noon.

01:37:38.771 --> 01:37:42.036
<i>Can you explain how your</i>
<i>investigation led to the apprehension of Tezo?</i>

01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:44.608
- and end up on the steps
of the 31 st Precinct.

01:37:44.777 --> 01:37:48.338
<i>Angel Tezo was identified by</i>
<i>witnesses at the scene of the shooting.</i>

01:37:48.514 --> 01:37:50.982
<i>I sought information</i>
<i>regarding his whereabouts...</i>

01:37:51.150 --> 01:37:53.414
<i>... from a former confidential informant.</i>

01:37:53.586 --> 01:37:56.783
<i>He directed me to the location in question</i>
<i>in Morrisania...</i>

01:37:56.956 --> 01:37:58.617
<i>... and I followed that lead.</i>

01:37:58.791 --> 01:38:03.091
The reverend reiterated
that this planned march is about peace...

01:38:03.262 --> 01:38:08.791
<i>... and is not intended as a condemnation</i>
<i>of the entire N.Y.P.D.</i>

01:38:08.968 --> 01:38:11.493
<i>His target: the 31 st Precinct...</i>

01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:15.401
...and the officers involved in the
Angel Tezo killing.

01:38:15.574 --> 01:38:17.371
The investigation is continuing.

01:38:17.543 --> 01:38:20.979
- Now, did you pursue this lead alone?
- No.

01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:24.373
I called the task force.
I spoke to my colleague, Detective Miller.

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:28.418
I told him where I was going.
I requested backup, and he initiated that.

01:38:28.587 --> 01:38:30.782
But you arrived on the location alone.

01:38:30.956 --> 01:38:33.481
I arrived before the rest of the team, yes.

01:38:34.727 --> 01:38:36.388
Okay.

01:38:38.664 --> 01:38:42.964
Now, could you describe for us what
transpired at the location in question...

01:38:43.135 --> 01:38:46.400
...leading up to you having to
discharge your weapon?

01:38:56.415 --> 01:38:57.746
Detective?

01:39:13.599 --> 01:39:15.999
This isn't gonna go how you want it to.

01:39:17.203 --> 01:39:18.431
Excuse me?

01:39:23.008 --> 01:39:25.704
I know what you guys want me to say...

01:39:26.212 --> 01:39:27.577
...but it's not gonna happen.

01:39:27.746 --> 01:39:31.443
No one's looking for you to say anything
except your version of what happened.

01:39:31.617 --> 01:39:33.812
- Really?
- All we need is a full accounting...

01:39:33.986 --> 01:39:35.851
...of what happened,
then we can go home.

01:39:36.021 --> 01:39:38.046
Yeah, I know what you need.

01:39:38.857 --> 01:39:42.315
But I can't give it to you,
because I didn't shoot him.

01:39:42.494 --> 01:39:45.952
Are you aware that ballistics
has confirmed that the perp was killed...

01:39:46.131 --> 01:39:48.929
<i>... by three bullets fired from your gun</i>
<i>at close range?</i>

01:39:49.101 --> 01:39:50.329
<i>I am.</i>

01:39:50.502 --> 01:39:52.470
<i>But you maintain</i>
<i>that you didn't shoot him?</i>

01:39:52.638 --> 01:39:54.105
<i>I do.</i>

01:39:54.273 --> 01:39:56.798
<i>Could you elaborate on that?</i>
- <i>No, I would not care to.</i>

01:39:56.976 --> 01:39:59.069
<i>What are you saying, detective?</i>

01:39:59.245 --> 01:40:01.679
<i>From here on out, nothing.</i>

01:40:01.847 --> 01:40:04.941
<i>I respectfully refuse</i>
<i>to answer any further questions.</i>

01:40:05.117 --> 01:40:08.177
<i>Are you denying that you</i>
<i>were involved in the Angel Tezo killing?</i>

01:40:08.354 --> 01:40:12.916
<i>I respectfully refuse</i>
<i>to answer any more questions.</i>

01:40:13.092 --> 01:40:15.492
<i>If you don't start answering,</i>
<i>this is gonna go bad.</i>

01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:17.128
<i>We can do this all afternoon...</i>

01:40:17.296 --> 01:40:20.959
<i>... but I have nothing more to say</i>
<i>in this matter.</i>

01:40:22.401 --> 01:40:25.962
<i>This wasn't like Ray. He's not that guy.</i>

01:40:26.138 --> 01:40:28.402
<i>He's a fucking good cop.</i>

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:31.375
<i>He's a good man.</i>

01:40:32.044 --> 01:40:34.877
<i>He said something about Lonnie Mercer,</i>
<i>"Lonnie and I."</i>

01:40:35.047 --> 01:40:38.710
<i>I remember that they were close.</i>
<i>They were partners.</i>

01:40:38.884 --> 01:40:42.479
<i>Lonnie Mercer, one of the</i>
<i>officers killed in the Washington Heights raid?</i>

01:40:42.655 --> 01:40:43.849
<i>That's right.</i>

01:40:44.023 --> 01:40:45.991
<i>What happened next?</i>

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.187
<i>I tried to revive Mr. Tezo.</i>

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.056
<i>I didn't know if he'd had a heart attack...</i>

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:53.562
<i>... or if he was still alive.</i>
<i>I tried to revive him.</i>

01:40:53.732 --> 01:40:56.599
<i>I checked for a pulse,</i>
<i>I couldn't find a fucking pulse.</i>

01:40:56.769 --> 01:40:58.168
<i>He looked pretty fucking dead.</i>

01:40:59.371 --> 01:41:02.534
<i>So I did some fucking CPR.</i>

01:41:02.708 --> 01:41:07.771
<i>After I tried to revive him,</i>
<i>I was still kneeling over the body.</i>

01:41:10.716 --> 01:41:12.980
<i>That's when the shots went off.</i>

01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:19.553
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

01:41:19.725 --> 01:41:21.420
<i>Who was shot?</i>

01:41:21.593 --> 01:41:24.721
- <i>Mr. Tezo was shot?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:41:24.897 --> 01:41:27.730
<i>Yeah, he was shot. Yeah, he was shot.</i>

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.165
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.</i>
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.</i>

01:41:31.704 --> 01:41:33.831
<i>Who shot Mr. Tezo?</i>

01:41:37.276 --> 01:41:39.938
<i>I would've done the same thing myself.</i>

01:41:40.112 --> 01:41:43.411
<i>Who shot Angel Tezo, Sergeant Egan?</i>

01:41:49.188 --> 01:41:51.247
<i>Detective Tierney.</i>

01:41:52.825 --> 01:41:55.316
<i>Detective Raymond Tierney?</i>

01:42:01.266 --> 01:42:02.631
<i>Yes.</i>

01:42:13.278 --> 01:42:15.007
Listen, Frank...

01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:20.675
...I know how this must feel,
and I wish I knew what to say.

01:42:21.787 --> 01:42:26.622
But you should know that these officers
are all prepared to testify at a grand jury.

01:42:27.459 --> 01:42:30.257
So what's critical now,
from here on out...

01:42:30.429 --> 01:42:34.490
...is that we handle this thing quietly,
with as little incident as possible.

01:42:34.666 --> 01:42:37.134
He's not capable of that.

01:42:37.736 --> 01:42:39.601
I know my son. He's not capable of that.

01:42:39.772 --> 01:42:43.071
Frank, we're gonna have to bring Ray in.

01:42:50.849 --> 01:42:52.407
You okay?

01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:54.712
Hey.

01:42:59.958 --> 01:43:01.892
I'm proud of you.

01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:05.722
Call me when it's done.

01:43:06.598 --> 01:43:10.591
<i>They wanna take you in,</i>
<i>put "arrest pending" in the press tomorrow.</i>

01:43:10.769 --> 01:43:13.602
I'm sitting there on my ass,
watching this fucking testimony.

01:43:13.772 --> 01:43:15.797
You believe that shit
that Jimmy's spinning?

01:43:15.974 --> 01:43:20.070
- You gonna tell me you believe that?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

01:43:20.245 --> 01:43:23.772
I told you to run everything through me
and that we would handle it.

01:43:23.949 --> 01:43:27.112
And then you sit down
with the goddamn IAB...

01:43:27.286 --> 01:43:28.685
...and don't give me a heads up?

01:43:28.854 --> 01:43:31.118
No fucking phone call?
You don't talk to me, Ray.

01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:33.258
I'm here. I'm telling you now, okay?

01:43:33.425 --> 01:43:36.622
Listen to me. Jimmy is a drug dealer, Pop.

01:43:36.795 --> 01:43:40.128
He murdered that guy, and Fran is in it.
Pop, he's in up to his neck.

01:43:40.299 --> 01:43:44.463
Now, I tried. I tried to talk to Fran,
and when I sat in there with those guys...

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:48.367
...I gave them nothing.
I said as little as I could say.

01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:53.477
But if Jimmy's gonna box me in, I gotta tell
them what I know. I got no fucking choice.

01:43:53.645 --> 01:43:55.772
The fuck you got no choice.

01:43:55.948 --> 01:43:58.610
You could've taken that lay-up
that they were handing you.

01:43:58.784 --> 01:44:01.582
- Oh, no. No, Pop.
- And saved us a fucking mess.

01:44:01.753 --> 01:44:03.516
Come on. What good would it have done?

01:44:03.689 --> 01:44:07.523
Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus.
We'll take care of him.

01:44:07.693 --> 01:44:11.754
But we got a hole that needs
to get plugged up...

01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:14.160
...before it takes down
half the department.

01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:16.130
It's too late, Pop.

01:44:17.002 --> 01:44:19.334
We protect our own, Ray.

01:44:19.505 --> 01:44:23.168
That is all I know. We protect our own.
You gotta show me some fucking loyalty.

01:44:23.342 --> 01:44:27.904
No. Don't use that word with me. It doesn't
mean shit to me anymore, you know that?

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.980
I done your loyalty. It cost me too much.

01:44:30.148 --> 01:44:33.311
- What did it cost you?
- It cost me everything!

01:44:33.919 --> 01:44:36.513
It cost me the woman that I love.

01:44:38.123 --> 01:44:40.853
Because she told me that we were wrong
on Mott Haven.

01:44:41.026 --> 01:44:42.391
She told me. I didn't listen.

01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:45.496
Look, you said you weren't sure about
what you saw. I heard it.

01:44:45.664 --> 01:44:48.360
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Don't bullshit me.

01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:51.867
It was a lie to protect a bad cop,
and you knew it, and I knew it.

01:44:52.037 --> 01:44:54.733
And I got up there and said it
in front of the grand jury.

01:44:54.907 --> 01:44:56.602
- I got it.
- I'm not gonna do this.

01:44:56.775 --> 01:44:58.640
- Not for you.
- I'm responsible, huh?

01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:03.008
- This is my responsibility, this shit?
- No. We did wrong. I wanna hear you say it.

01:45:03.181 --> 01:45:04.580
Both of you, stop the yelling.

01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:06.877
- Get out of here, Mo.
- No. Stop it.

01:45:07.052 --> 01:45:08.747
- Get out of here.
- I am not leaving.

01:45:08.921 --> 01:45:10.411
- This is not for you.
- No, no.

01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:12.853
- I am not leaving.
- I don't want you hearing this.

01:45:13.025 --> 01:45:14.549
Hey, hey, hey. Dad, take it easy.

01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:17.456
- Don't yell at her.
- Get upstairs.

01:45:18.497 --> 01:45:19.691
This is too much.

01:45:38.283 --> 01:45:41.480
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

01:45:41.653 --> 01:45:43.712
This is not just about the department.

01:45:43.889 --> 01:45:46.483
That's not what we're talking about here.

01:45:46.658 --> 01:45:49.286
This is family. This is our way of life.

01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:50.928
Jimmy is married to your sister.

01:45:51.096 --> 01:45:54.896
He's the father of her children,
for chrissake.

01:45:55.067 --> 01:45:59.401
And your brother is in a bad hour here,
and the only way through this is you.

01:45:59.571 --> 01:46:01.835
You're the only door.

01:46:02.474 --> 01:46:06.274
Jimmy is gonna take back his story.
I'll see to that.

01:46:06.445 --> 01:46:09.539
And you just follow the crumbs
like they're laid out for you.

01:46:09.715 --> 01:46:11.979
Take a deep breath
and say what needs to be said.

01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:16.678
Like you believe it with every bone of your
body, and then we move through this thing.

01:46:16.855 --> 01:46:20.018
- And that's what you're gonna do.
- No.

01:46:20.726 --> 01:46:23.160
No, he's not gonna do that, Pop.

01:46:25.397 --> 01:46:29.561
- Franny, listen.
- Ray is not getting hung out for what I did.

01:46:29.735 --> 01:46:30.929
What I did.

01:46:31.603 --> 01:46:33.594
He'll get a slap on the wrist,
nothing more.

01:46:33.772 --> 01:46:36.639
- You're not thinking clearly, Franny.
- Yeah, I am.

01:46:36.808 --> 01:46:42.178
Listen to me, Pop. This shit ends now.

01:46:42.347 --> 01:46:44.212
Tonight.

01:46:46.318 --> 01:46:49.651
And if that means
I can't be a cop anymore...

01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:52.384
...I'm okay with that.

01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:11.274
What do you want me to do?

01:47:12.744 --> 01:47:16.202
We're gonna get Jimmy.
That's what we're gonna do.

01:47:17.215 --> 01:47:19.376
Yeah. Okay.

01:47:35.367 --> 01:47:37.801
Just gonna make a stop over here.

01:47:38.170 --> 01:47:39.967
Real quick.

01:47:41.673 --> 01:47:43.470
What are you doing?

01:47:43.809 --> 01:47:45.333
I gotta pick something up.

01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:47.978
Picking up what?
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?

01:47:48.146 --> 01:47:51.343
- I gotta make a collection.
- A collection with a gun? Jesus, come on.

01:47:51.516 --> 01:47:53.950
Jimmy told us to lay low.
Stay under the radar.

01:47:54.119 --> 01:47:57.418
- You know what? Fuck Jimmy.
- Fuck Jimmy? What are you talking about?

01:47:57.589 --> 01:48:00.387
- Jimmy's looking out for us.
- Jimmy ain't looking out for me!

01:48:00.559 --> 01:48:05.223
He ain't paying my fucking rent! I got no
fucking money in my pocket. I'm broke!

01:48:05.397 --> 01:48:08.195
- Jeez, you coming with me or not?
- No, I'm not coming, Eddie.

01:48:08.366 --> 01:48:11.358
- Do what you wanna do. Stay here.
- I will fucking stay here.

01:48:17.576 --> 01:48:19.271
Yo, bro.

01:48:36.828 --> 01:48:40.195
No, I'm not a fucking cop anymore.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:48:43.068 --> 01:48:45.263
You gotta do this every time?

01:48:46.738 --> 01:48:49.468
Let's fucking go, Eddie. Let's go.

01:48:51.943 --> 01:48:53.467
- Shit, Eddie!
- Get down. get down.

01:48:53.645 --> 01:48:56.170
Eddie, fucking... Eddie.

01:48:56.348 --> 01:48:58.111
I see how it is.

01:48:58.283 --> 01:49:02.515
Out of the store. I'm a cop. Out of the
fucking store. Get the fuck out of the store!

01:49:02.687 --> 01:49:05.212
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun now.

01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:10.191
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Out now! Go.

01:49:10.362 --> 01:49:12.887
He got a gun, man.
- You! You!

01:49:13.899 --> 01:49:17.357
- You!
- Oh, shit.

01:49:17.536 --> 01:49:19.367
Yo, that's that nigga right there.

01:49:28.013 --> 01:49:29.446
<i>That's what I said.</i>
- You sure?

01:49:29.614 --> 01:49:31.605
<i>Yes, I'm sure.</i>

01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:34.785
No, I can't talk right now, Megan.

01:49:36.087 --> 01:49:38.146
I know it, I'm with him.

01:49:39.191 --> 01:49:41.284
No, we'll call you soon.

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.886
Okay.

01:49:45.897 --> 01:49:48.127
He's at Irish Eyes.

01:49:50.969 --> 01:49:53.699
You motherfucker, unlock that door!

01:49:53.872 --> 01:49:58.468
You stupid, stupid idiot, Eddie.
You fucking...

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:04.876
How do I get out of here?

01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:06.574
Is there another way out of here?

01:50:06.751 --> 01:50:08.810
Tell me.
Is there another way out of here?

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.327
- Back door.
- Fucking show me. Show me!

01:50:18.496 --> 01:50:20.088
Goddamn it. Go right or left?

01:50:20.265 --> 01:50:21.857
Left.

01:50:24.536 --> 01:50:27.437
Oh, shit! Is there another fucking exit?

01:50:27.606 --> 01:50:29.335
No, fuck it. Don't talk.

01:50:29.507 --> 01:50:32.135
<i>Callback, Central.</i>
- <i>Stand by, units.</i>

01:50:34.746 --> 01:50:36.509
- Tierney.
<i>We got a 10-30 on Audubon.</i>

01:50:36.681 --> 01:50:40.139
- I know. It's coming over the radio.
- <i>That ain't the problem, I got a riot.</i>

01:50:40.318 --> 01:50:42.843
Wait, man, slow down.
I can't understand you. What?

01:50:43.021 --> 01:50:45.683
<i>Looks like it's two guys from</i>
<i>your command. Two SNEU guys.</i>

01:50:46.224 --> 01:50:47.782
Who?

01:50:49.761 --> 01:50:51.558
I'm on my way.

01:50:52.197 --> 01:50:53.687
It's Dugan and Carbone.

01:50:53.865 --> 01:50:56.095
<i>I'm gonna need units for crowd control.</i>

01:50:56.268 --> 01:50:57.565
You gotta go.

01:50:57.736 --> 01:50:59.863
I'll get Jimmy.

01:51:00.038 --> 01:51:01.699
Destroy that piece of shit!

01:51:13.551 --> 01:51:16.247
I fucking told you not to do it.

01:51:24.796 --> 01:51:27.663
Chief Tierney,
I'm Captain Lavier from Internal Affairs.

01:51:27.832 --> 01:51:30.960
Have a warrant for your son's arrest.
We'd like him to come with us.

01:51:31.136 --> 01:51:33.229
What makes you think he's here?

01:51:33.805 --> 01:51:34.999
Car's outside.

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.001
Got a message? I'll tell him.

01:51:38.176 --> 01:51:41.634
- How about if I come in myself and tell him?
- No, you're not invited.

01:51:41.813 --> 01:51:45.305
Now, get the hell off my porch
and take your boys with you.

01:51:46.484 --> 01:51:47.917
Let's go.

01:51:48.086 --> 01:51:50.486
You can tell your superiors I said so.

01:51:51.756 --> 01:51:52.950
Let's go.

01:51:57.696 --> 01:52:00.961
They got the fucking place surrounded.
Just get down here, Jimmy.

01:52:02.634 --> 01:52:04.465
We'll meet back here.

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.342
What's going down in there? Pepe okay?

01:52:18.883 --> 01:52:21.317
I hope Pepe killed 20
of you motherfuckers.

01:52:21.486 --> 01:52:23.454
Let's go. Move back.

01:52:24.322 --> 01:52:26.517
Do you believe this shit?

01:52:26.691 --> 01:52:30.252
- We got any communication established?
- I requested Hostage Negotiation, sir.

01:52:30.428 --> 01:52:32.726
They give you an ETA?
- Not yet, sir.

01:52:32.897 --> 01:52:36.492
All right.
I want this perimeter pushed back.

01:52:36.668 --> 01:52:39.637
Big Stevie, Ponch, you're my shooters.

01:52:42.073 --> 01:52:43.768
I'm going in.

01:52:44.275 --> 01:52:45.799
Boss.

01:52:45.977 --> 01:52:48.070
These are my guys.

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.813
I'm going in.

01:53:00.725 --> 01:53:03.319
Where is everybody? Get over there!

01:53:03.495 --> 01:53:05.326
Let's go, move it!

01:53:05.497 --> 01:53:08.261
Fuck, man. Come on, hurry up.

01:53:13.738 --> 01:53:17.105
They knocked my tooth out. Black and blue.
My whole family disrespected.

01:53:17.275 --> 01:53:19.402
These motherfuckers!

01:53:27.652 --> 01:53:30.519
Whoa. Whoa, man, easy.

01:53:30.688 --> 01:53:32.849
Kenny, easy.

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:34.924
Let's not lose our heads here.

01:53:35.093 --> 01:53:36.617
I'm gonna fucking kill him, boss.

01:53:36.795 --> 01:53:40.128
Kenny, just keep it calm, all right?
It's just me.

01:53:40.498 --> 01:53:42.762
Get them motherfuckers out of here!
It's on.

01:53:43.368 --> 01:53:46.860
I swear to Jesus Christ,
I will fucking kill him, Franny.

01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:55.238
In about two minutes,
we got everybody showing up here.

01:53:55.413 --> 01:53:59.144
You do not want that to happen. You do not
want me to lose control of this scene.

01:53:59.317 --> 01:54:01.842
Do not fucking play me, Franny.

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:05.649
There's no play here, Kenny.
There's no fucking play.

01:54:06.391 --> 01:54:09.326
You wanna talk to me or
you wanna talk to a stranger?

01:54:11.563 --> 01:54:12.587
Kenny.

01:54:13.131 --> 01:54:14.962
Open the door.

01:54:46.664 --> 01:54:49.690
Police. I want everyone
out of this bar right now.

01:54:52.837 --> 01:54:54.634
You too, Mac.

01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:19.522
You got anything you wanna say to me
about what you've done?

01:55:21.032 --> 01:55:23.364
You left me no choice, Ray.

01:55:23.868 --> 01:55:26.928
Push to shove, it's me and mine.
It's Megan and the kids.

01:55:27.272 --> 01:55:29.763
After that, it's every swinging dick
for himself.

01:55:30.008 --> 01:55:32.670
You broke our fucking hearts, Jimmy.

01:55:35.413 --> 01:55:37.711
Lot of hearts broken, Ray.

01:55:39.984 --> 01:55:41.679
There's a lot of hearts broken.

01:55:50.094 --> 01:55:52.289
So how do you think this ends?

01:55:56.067 --> 01:55:57.261
You gonna take me in?

01:55:58.603 --> 01:56:00.901
Take your gun out and put it on the bar.

01:57:26.858 --> 01:57:28.849
Turn on me, Ray!

01:57:29.027 --> 01:57:33.430
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:58:12.136 --> 01:58:16.436
I'm gonna send in a crew! Open it up!
Let's go, let's go!

01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:54.935
Back! Everybody step back.

01:58:58.716 --> 01:59:00.411
You gotta push these guys back.

01:59:29.313 --> 01:59:31.247
Ray. Ray.
- Shut up, Jimmy.

01:59:31.416 --> 01:59:33.509
- Move. Move.
- Ray.

01:59:35.253 --> 01:59:37.380
That's him. That's that nigga Egan. Go.

01:59:37.555 --> 01:59:39.216
- Get behind me.
- Take the cuffs off.

01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:41.483
- Shut up. Get behind me.
- Yo, that's him!

01:59:41.659 --> 01:59:45.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Right there. Police
officer. Stay back. This man's under arrest.

01:59:46.063 --> 01:59:48.327
Take the cuffs off, give me my gun.
- Shut up.

01:59:48.499 --> 01:59:50.467
We want Egan, not you.
Walk away, you live.

01:59:50.635 --> 01:59:52.330
Fuck you! Stay back.

01:59:52.503 --> 01:59:54.471
- I'm not kidding.
- You gonna kill everybody?

01:59:54.639 --> 01:59:56.504
Try me.
- They're gonna tear us apart.

01:59:56.674 --> 02:00:00.132
- This ain't your fight.
- That nigga's dead. Give me that stick.

02:00:00.311 --> 02:00:02.575
You walk out with me right now.
Let's go.

02:00:05.249 --> 02:00:06.409
Jimmy!

02:00:09.353 --> 02:00:10.843
Let him be. Let him be.

02:00:11.022 --> 02:00:12.455
- You motherfuckers!
- Back off!

02:00:12.623 --> 02:00:13.851
Jimmy!
- Back the fuck off!

02:00:14.025 --> 02:00:15.424
Jimmy!
Back off!

02:00:15.593 --> 02:00:17.618
Back off! Nigga's mine.
This nigga's mine!

02:00:17.795 --> 02:00:21.731
Get off of me, you motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

02:00:22.233 --> 02:00:25.293
No! Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!

02:00:26.237 --> 02:00:27.727
Tell her I love her.

02:00:27.905 --> 02:00:30.874
Don't you fucking do it! No! Jimmy!

02:00:31.042 --> 02:00:33.806
No! No! Don't fucking do it!

02:00:33.978 --> 02:00:35.275
Don't you do it!

02:00:38.416 --> 02:00:39.474
Jimmy.

02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:19.954
Detective Tierney. Your CO's my brother.

02:01:20.124 --> 02:01:21.921
You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

02:01:22.093 --> 02:01:23.856
- You sure?
- I'm all right.

02:01:58.029 --> 02:02:00.964
You go find him, I got the brief.
- Okay. Great job, boss.

02:02:01.132 --> 02:02:02.622
Thanks.

02:02:03.367 --> 02:02:07.736
Hi, chief. Couple of my suspended guys
were involved in this 30...

02:02:28.726 --> 02:02:30.557
The fuck happened to you?

02:02:31.896 --> 02:02:33.329
What?

02:02:34.799 --> 02:02:35.823
Where's Jimmy?

02:02:41.839 --> 02:02:42.897
Let's go home.
