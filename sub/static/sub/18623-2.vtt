00:21.084 --> 00:24.055
He said, "I don't bother with
the Grand National any more."

00:24.056 --> 00:28.039
"Last year, my horse started at
33-1 at Aintree and ended up as"

00:28.040 --> 00:31.024
"two for one at ASDA!"

00:32.076 --> 00:36.047
Excuse me. Could we get the bill,
please? Of course.

00:36.048 --> 00:40.999
Anyway, like I was saying, we
were at Lingfield... '89, was it?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.063
No, it was later than that. Eh?
Yes, it was after Diana had died.

00:44.064 --> 00:47.051
What's she got to do with it?
I just remember.

00:47.052 --> 00:49.059
All right, well, '99, whatever.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.039
And the Professor here had worked
out if we put this

00:52.040 --> 00:54.331
accumulator on seven races,
we could have made...

00:54.357 --> 00:56.027
What was it, Archie?
Half a million.

00:56.028 --> 00:59.043
Half a million. Well, it wasn't
half a million. It was 469,000.

00:59.044 --> 01:02.039
All right. Fucking hell. We're
not to the nearest quid, are we?

01:02.040 --> 01:05.022
Kevin, will you stop interrupting
my flow? Yeah, sorry.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.075
So, we all had to pick
seven horses and put

01:07.076 --> 01:09.075
a tenner each in the diddlum.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.039
The what?

01:11.040 --> 01:13.051
The diddlum.

01:13.052 --> 01:14.542
What's a diddlum? The diddlum!
It's

01:14.555 --> 01:16.055
a wotsit where you all chip in.

01:16.056 --> 01:19.027
It's the diddlum.
You never heard of a diddlum? No.

01:19.028 --> 01:22.051
It's where you pay in a bit each
week. It's a savings scheme.

01:22.052 --> 01:25.054
Like a northern thing? You
know, "Put tha' money in't

01:25.067 --> 01:28.079
diddlum and buy some whippets
and barm cakes and..."

01:28.080 --> 01:30.047
Sorry, go on.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.056
So, anyway, we'd all put
in our diddlum money

01:32.069 --> 01:34.087
and chose a horse each
for the first round.

01:34.088 --> 01:36.070
You had, what was it?
Hoof Hearted?

01:36.083 --> 01:38.075
Hoof Hearted, 3-1,
second favourite.

01:38.076 --> 01:41.047
Prof chose some fancy
writer thing. Outrageous...

01:41.048 --> 01:44.015
Outrageous Fortune. That's it,
after the Bette Midler film.

01:44.016 --> 01:47.083
Shakespeare.
And I had Mashie Niblick at 50-1.

01:47.084 --> 01:50.055
See? Clever boy,
back the outsider. Exactly!

01:50.056 --> 01:51.091
To push the winnings up.

01:51.092 --> 01:55.023
Life is either a daring adventure
or it is nothing at all.

01:55.024 --> 01:59.075
Do you know who said that?
Helen Keller. Going for Gold.

01:59.076 --> 02:01.999
That's Henry Kelly!

02:02.000 --> 02:03.011
Yeah, sorry.

02:03.012 --> 02:04.998
So, anyway, what happened
next, I gave the

02:05.011 --> 02:07.007
diddlum money to Archie...
He didn't.

02:07.008 --> 02:09.095
I did! He says he did, but he was
found... No, let me finish!

02:09.096 --> 02:11.538
He was found in the
hospitality area... Rubbish!

02:11.551 --> 02:14.003
..with two dolly birds and
a full English breakfast.

02:14.004 --> 02:16.020
Slightly the worse for wear.
Well, I was upset

02:16.033 --> 02:18.059
that Diana had died! And
he'd spent the lot. No!

02:18.060 --> 02:20.526
Yeah, kerching. What?
Diddled the diddlum? He

02:20.539 --> 02:23.015
did indeed. Malcolm! So,
just be warned, Craig,

02:23.016 --> 02:25.019
you can't trust him as far
as you can throw him.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.059
Excuse me, Archie!
People in glass houses!

02:28.060 --> 02:30.036
What?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.004
Shouldn't throw stones.

02:37.008 --> 02:40.019
No, they should throw sex parties
with strippers. LAUGHTER.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.039
So, come on, then.
What happened then?

02:42.040 --> 02:45.079
No, don't tell me. All the horses
came in, right? Yeah, exactly.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.051
Half a million down the drain.
Well, 469,000.

02:48.052 --> 02:50.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
It's only money

02:50.049 --> 02:52.043
in't it, Craig? Not
worth falling out over.

02:52.044 --> 02:54.075
Here you go, gentlemen.

02:54.076 --> 02:56.532
I hope you enjoy your meal.
It was lovely, thanks.

02:56.545 --> 02:59.011
Excuse me, darling. Can we
get some mints? Please?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.014
You know, the mints
in the bowl by the

03:01.027 --> 03:03.039
till, just to
cleanse the palate.

03:03.040 --> 03:07.047
Oh, no, the kitchen boy
will cleanse the palate.

03:07.048 --> 03:08.075
No, no. Not plates.

03:08.076 --> 03:11.071
The palate. You know? The palate.

03:11.072 --> 03:15.035
I mean the mints. In the mouth.
Sucky-sucky.

03:15.036 --> 03:18.060
Oh, sorry. Yes. I'll get you
some. It's my first day. So...

03:20.036 --> 03:24.003
Well, she's not getting a tip. I
wouldn't mind giving her MY tip.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.007
What are you doing,
asking for piss-mints? Eh?

03:27.008 --> 03:29.055
Piss-mints by the till.
Why are they piss-mints?

03:29.056 --> 03:32.007
Because people come out the bogs,
they don't wash their hands

03:32.008 --> 03:34.055
and then they dip in for
a mint on the way past. No!

03:34.056 --> 03:35.534
People aren't animals.
They are,

03:35.547 --> 03:37.035
actually. They did a test.
Exactly.

03:37.036 --> 03:39.091
They tested a bowl, they
found 15 different types of piss.

03:39.092 --> 03:41.083
What do you mean - different
types of piss?!

03:41.084 --> 03:44.079
There aren't different types of
piss! There are! Like fine wines!

03:44.080 --> 03:47.011
Jesus Christ! I can't wait to get
back to Chiswick.

03:47.012 --> 03:49.047
Yeah, because London piss is like
sparkling water,

03:49.048 --> 03:51.087
you just drink it straight back
down again. Pretty much, yeah.

03:51.088 --> 03:54.071
Well, I'm just telling you,
mints in northern restaurants,

03:54.072 --> 03:56.524
they're all drenched in piss.
And faecal

03:56.537 --> 03:58.999
matter. There you go, I
give you big handful.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Look at them, Craig!
You not going

04:01.013 --> 04:03.023
to cleanse your palate, then?
Er...

04:03.024 --> 04:05.091
No, I think I'll take them
for the kids.

04:05.092 --> 04:08.019
How many kids do you have, Craig?
I've got two.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.035
It's half-term,
so they come up with the au pair.

04:10.036 --> 04:12.091
I told them it was a safari,
but with poor people. Hey!

04:12.092 --> 04:14.080
There's plenty of lolly
swilling around up here, you

04:14.093 --> 04:16.091
know. As long as you know
where to look for it.

04:16.091 --> 04:19.027
And your wife, is she...?
Divorced.

04:19.028 --> 04:22.079
Best three-quarter of
a million pound I ever spent.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.059
Really? Yeah.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.087
Why is a wife like
a hand grenade?

04:26.088 --> 04:30.067
Remove the ring and boom, your
house has gone. LAUGHTER.

04:30.068 --> 04:32.063
That's a terribly expensive
business.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.039
Do you know why it's
so expensive, Kevin?

04:35.040 --> 04:38.043
Because it's worth it.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.019
Talking of unseemly
squabbles about money,

04:41.020 --> 04:44.000
let's have a little
look at this bill.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.500
Well, there's my contribution,

04:47.513 --> 04:50.003
including a 10% service charge.
10?

04:50.004 --> 04:53.031
You tight bastard! Give her 15,
like a normal human being!

04:53.032 --> 04:56.063
10 is industry standard. What
industry? She's slopping plates

04:56.064 --> 04:59.003
round for a room
full of fat pigs!

04:59.004 --> 05:02.083
Honestly, Kevin! Give it here,
Craig. I'm going to get this.

05:02.084 --> 05:06.027
No, Malcolm. No way, that's not
right. Shut up, I am. It's on me.

05:06.028 --> 05:08.023
You got it last time,
let me get this one.

05:08.024 --> 05:10.048
Get off, I'm paying it.
How much is

05:10.061 --> 05:12.095
it? Ooh, Jesus Christ!
Go on, then!

05:12.096 --> 05:14.078
Joking! I'm joking!
I don't mind,

05:14.091 --> 05:16.083
honestly. No, I'm
not having that.

05:16.084 --> 05:18.030
I invited Craig along.
I was going

05:18.043 --> 05:19.999
to pay for him anyway. So what?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.004
Craig's my friend. You
can't play with him! Don't

05:22.017 --> 05:24.031
be so childish, Archie.
I'm not being childish.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.042
You're the one who's being
childish. Hey, it doesn't

05:26.055 --> 05:28.075
matter. It does. You're
messing it up. It's not fair.

05:28.076 --> 05:31.003
Guys, listen, I'm getting it.
No! No! Yes!

05:31.004 --> 05:32.532
I'm going back to
civilisation soon. I know

05:32.545 --> 05:34.083
that all you northerners
are very poor,

05:34.084 --> 05:37.083
what with your Christmas clubs
and your diddums... Diddlums.

05:37.084 --> 05:40.999
So, I'd like to treat you all,
please. No arguments!

05:41.000 --> 05:43.015
Well, thank you, Craig.
That's very kind of you.

05:43.016 --> 05:44.506
Bloody hell, Kevin!
That was quick. You

05:44.519 --> 05:46.019
thanked him before
he'd even offered!

05:46.020 --> 05:48.063
Doesn't miss a trick, does he?
No, I offered to pay my way.

05:48.064 --> 05:49.534
Yeah, like the time
you offered me petrol

05:49.547 --> 05:51.027
money for that league
game in Otley!

05:51.028 --> 05:53.042
That was based on mileage
as the crow flies, divided

05:53.055 --> 05:55.079
by the four of us. Â£2! It
was mathematically sound!

05:55.080 --> 05:57.063
Yeah, all in coppers!

05:57.064 --> 06:00.047
Right, shall I split
you four ways? No.

06:00.048 --> 06:02.087
No, but I wouldn't mind
splitting you four ways.

06:02.088 --> 06:05.095
No, I'm getting this. It's been
very nice to meet you, Craig.

06:05.096 --> 06:08.075
You played very well tonight,
the pair of you beat Kevin and I

06:08.076 --> 06:10.534
fair and square, so Victoribus

06:10.547 --> 06:13.015
Spolia, to the
victor, the spoils.

06:13.016 --> 06:15.095
Well, I won't argue with you,
Malcs. I'm sorry, Malcolm.

06:15.096 --> 06:18.095
That is bullshit! Eh? We've never
played that before, loser pays!

06:18.096 --> 06:22.023
It's a very dangerous precedent
to set. It's not a precedent.

06:22.024 --> 06:23.500
I would like to pay for your

06:23.513 --> 06:24.999
meals. Put it all
on this, please.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.023
No, put on this, please.
I insist.

06:27.024 --> 06:29.040
All right, calm down. You'll
give yourself a heart

06:29.053 --> 06:31.079
attack. Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

06:31.080 --> 06:35.039
It's just important to me,
all right? Thank you, Archie.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.039
That's very kind. Bloody hell!

06:38.040 --> 06:39.538
Never realised that
badminton was so

06:39.551 --> 06:41.059
competitive. It's
not competitive.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.542
It's just that Malcolm is
overgenerous at times,

06:43.555 --> 06:46.047
aren't you, Malc? This
is my treat, everybody.

06:46.048 --> 06:48.024
You can get the next one.
Sorry,

06:48.037 --> 06:50.024
it's run out of paper.
I'll be back.

06:53.056 --> 06:55.075
I'll be back!

06:55.076 --> 06:57.048
Terminator.

06:59.008 --> 07:00.520
Very clever, Archie.
Very clever

07:00.533 --> 07:02.055
trick. I can see
what you're doing.

07:02.056 --> 07:04.022
What do you mean?
Letting me get the

07:04.035 --> 07:06.011
next one, which is,
oh, let me think,

07:06.012 --> 07:08.000
wives and girlfriends
night at Browns. So?

07:08.013 --> 07:10.011
So, it'll be double
the price, won't it?

07:10.012 --> 07:12.043
Even more, if your Susie puts it
away like she did at the

07:12.044 --> 07:14.087
Christmas do! Malcolm!
All those mojitos!

07:14.088 --> 07:18.048
You shouldn't bring Susie into
it, Malcolm. That's wrong.

07:20.044 --> 07:22.043
I like the sound of Susie!

07:22.044 --> 07:24.043
Has she got a sister?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.007
Anyway, it's fine.
You just get this little starter.

07:27.008 --> 07:29.047
I'll pay for the proper grown-up
meal next time. Well done.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.554
Fine, I'll get the
next one as well, if

07:30.567 --> 07:32.083
you're keeping track.
No-one's keeping track.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.060
You clearly are, if you're
thinking one ahead.

07:34.073 --> 07:36.059
It hadn't occurred to me
what the next one was.

07:36.060 --> 07:39.015
Why don't you just
split it, then?

07:39.016 --> 07:43.023
Eh? Why don't you just split it
two ways? Then no-one loses face.

07:43.024 --> 07:46.027
Who's losing face? I'm not losing
face. Why two ways anyway?

07:46.028 --> 07:48.031
Why not three ways?

07:48.032 --> 07:51.023
Fine, fine. If Craig wants...
I meant with you!

07:51.024 --> 07:54.015
Jesus! What a blue cock! What's a
blue cock? A tight-fisted wanker.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.039
Ha! That's good!
I'm having that! No, no.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.047
Listen, I'm happy to pay my way.
I've already demonstrated that.

07:59.048 --> 08:01.035
Oh, put your little purse away,
Ebenezer.

08:01.036 --> 08:02.075
We don't need your shrapnel.

08:02.076 --> 08:03.568
Do you want me to pay or not?
Yeah,

08:03.581 --> 08:05.083
three ways! So we
can treat Craig!

08:05.084 --> 08:07.532
It's not necessary. Fine!
Well, I don't drink

08:07.545 --> 08:10.003
and I didn't have a
starter, so... So what?

08:10.004 --> 08:12.091
You contributed to the evening,
to the company provided,

08:12.092 --> 08:15.015
not what's in your belly!
He always does this!

08:15.016 --> 08:18.027
No, it's just that I know all
these menus... Kids' menus!

08:18.028 --> 08:19.536
That is not the point
and I know exactly

08:19.549 --> 08:21.067
what I'm going to have
before I come out.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.039
And I like to have the requisite
funds about my person.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.012
I don't have the
same resources as

08:26.025 --> 08:28.007
you, do I? I have
to be careful.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.039
Careful?!
He's got two houses in Clitheroe!

08:30.040 --> 08:32.022
Well, they're flats and one
of them's got my mother

08:32.034 --> 08:34.027
in it, so... And how much
rent do you charge her?

08:34.028 --> 08:36.095
None of your business!
Bloody hell! I was joking!

08:36.096 --> 08:38.535
He's that mean, when he
takes a tenner out of

08:38.549 --> 08:40.999
his wallet, the Queen
blinks in the light!

08:41.000 --> 08:42.589
No, it's that I don't
think it's fair that

08:42.602 --> 08:44.201
I end up subsidising
other people's...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.091
What?

08:47.092 --> 08:50.035
Gluttony!

08:50.036 --> 08:52.083
Are you directing
that at me, Kevin?

08:52.084 --> 08:55.047
Are you directing that at me?
Cos this is glandular!

08:55.048 --> 08:58.015
Right. So, it was, Mr Simkins...?
Yes.

08:58.016 --> 08:59.067
No, no, guys, honest.

08:59.068 --> 09:02.087
I've got this. Now, put it away.
No. Please! I'd really like to!

09:02.088 --> 09:04.060
I'll pay.

09:09.096 --> 09:12.016
I'd like to pay the whole bill,
please.

09:14.016 --> 09:16.091
Kevin, that is...
so generous of you.

09:16.092 --> 09:18.059
Are you sure?

09:18.060 --> 09:20.000
It's fine.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.051
Perhaps you could all put
in for the tip.

09:27.052 --> 09:29.554
Well, wonders never cease.
Oh, and

09:29.567 --> 09:32.079
I have these vouchers
for 50% off.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.075
What?! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
50% off?!

09:34.076 --> 09:36.056
Yes, I got them from
a coupon website.

09:36.069 --> 09:38.059
You were going to
let ME pay for it?

09:38.060 --> 09:40.038
Well, I was saving them
for another time. What

09:40.051 --> 09:42.039
other time? You never go out!
I'm sorry, Kevin.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.546
If you're paying for
dinner, you're paying

09:43.559 --> 09:45.075
for dinner. None of
this coupon shit!

09:45.076 --> 09:49.051
They are out of date anyway.
I'm sorry. LAUGHTER.

09:49.052 --> 09:52.019
They're like your condoms, Kevin!
Use by January 2000!

09:52.020 --> 09:55.095
Get your pound notes out with
Isaac Newton on the back!

09:55.096 --> 09:59.071
I'm sorry about that. I
was just... Let me...

09:59.072 --> 10:02.020
Oh... Ah...

10:04.072 --> 10:06.055
I come back in a minute.

10:06.056 --> 10:09.999
Um... Can I offer you guys
to be shot, or something?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.035
Sorry? She means a free drink.

10:12.036 --> 10:14.999
Oh, yes. Thank you. Oh, that
made his eyes light up, look.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.075
Got any Limoncello? Please?

10:16.076 --> 10:18.071
It's a liqueur.

10:18.072 --> 10:20.095
Lick your what? Sorry?

10:20.096 --> 10:22.051
It's a drink.

10:22.052 --> 10:25.043
Um, I will check. I'll be back.

10:25.044 --> 10:28.055
You wait, she'll come back
with a lemon and a cello!

10:30.084 --> 10:34.055
I was dreading this week.
One boring seminar after another.

10:34.056 --> 10:36.032
If I hadn't met Archie,
it would have been one

10:36.045 --> 10:38.031
long round of business
lunches and hotel porn.

10:38.032 --> 10:39.059
Don't sound too bad!

10:39.060 --> 10:44.039
You guys, you made it bearable.
So, please, let me get this. No.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.071
I'm getting it, I'm just...
Leave it, Kevin! I'll get it!

10:47.072 --> 10:51.023
You're not getting it! I've told
you! Don't point at me, Malcolm.

10:51.024 --> 10:53.051
Honestly, let me.
It's no skin off my nose.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.024
We all know you're really rich.
What's that supposed

10:55.037 --> 10:57.019
to mean? Hey, I don't
care if he's Bill Gates.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.007
He played at our club, I'm club
sec, I'm paying for his meal.

11:00.008 --> 11:01.492
And there it is in a nutshell,

11:01.505 --> 11:02.999
Craig. You've been bought.
Kerching.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.023
Not this again. I'm afraid
so, Malcolm. This again.

11:05.024 --> 11:07.019
How many votes was it? Tell him.
I don't remember.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.035
17-5 and he's club secretary. I'd
been there five years before him.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.059
Don't dredge up old graves,
Archie. It's unseemly.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.024
There was no funny business.
Who did you vote

11:14.037 --> 11:16.011
for, then? You don't
have to tell him, Kevin.

11:16.012 --> 11:18.014
It was anonymous. You
were seen, Kevin, a

11:18.027 --> 11:20.039
Garfunkel's lunch every
day for a fortnight.

11:20.040 --> 11:23.055
That's not true! Were you
spying on us? Bloody hell!

11:23.056 --> 11:25.032
If you're that desperate,
put your name up next

11:25.045 --> 11:27.031
time. I won't stand again.
Don't worry, I will!

11:27.032 --> 11:29.040
If that's all you've got
to worry about, I'm happy

11:29.053 --> 11:31.071
for you, Archie. You must
have a very nice life.

11:31.072 --> 11:33.046
Get off my back, Malcolm!
You've got

11:33.059 --> 11:35.043
no idea about my life!
Guys, don't.

11:35.044 --> 11:37.522
It's just a couple of hundred
quid. It's literally

11:37.535 --> 11:40.023
nothing. Oh, it's nothing,
is it, Mr Monopoly?

11:40.024 --> 11:41.532
Archie, what's got into you?
Besides, the

11:41.545 --> 11:43.063
club would never have
allowed somebody with

11:43.064 --> 11:44.566
a criminal record
to become club

11:44.579 --> 11:46.091
secretary. Nobody
cares about that!

11:46.092 --> 11:49.027
That was me utilising a clause
in a mortgage contract!

11:49.028 --> 11:51.012
Also known as fraud.
You're the fraud, pal!

11:51.025 --> 11:53.019
You bought every single
one of those votes!

11:53.020 --> 11:55.047
Because I treated Kevin to
a foot long from Subway?! Yes!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.520
And this is what
he's doing now,

11:56.533 --> 11:58.015
Craig, so just be aware.
Bull crap!

11:58.016 --> 11:59.502
He's putting you
in his pocket, in

11:59.515 --> 12:01.011
case he needs you
at a later date!

12:01.012 --> 12:03.012
I'm offering to buy
everyone's meal!

12:03.025 --> 12:05.036
Yes, because you're
a selfish prick!

12:11.068 --> 12:13.023
He isn't, Archie.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.047
Just calm down.

12:14.048 --> 12:16.016
He isn't.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.020
Because I am paying
for this meal.

12:22.004 --> 12:25.059
Yes, I live in London!
Yes, I'm very rich!

12:25.060 --> 12:28.063
But that is my prerogative,
as your guest, all right?

12:28.064 --> 12:30.534
Here we go. Some
Limoncello for you, and

12:30.547 --> 12:33.027
have you decide yet
who pay the bill?

12:33.028 --> 12:36.059
Yeah, put it all on this.
And put on 25% for yourself.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.520
Right, gentlemen,
I'd like to thank

12:38.533 --> 12:41.003
you for your company
this evening.

12:41.004 --> 12:43.008
And for a good game of badminton.
And if any of

12:43.021 --> 12:45.035
you happen to find yourself
in the Chiswick area,

12:45.036 --> 12:48.003
please don't hesitate to
NOT ring me! Cheers!

12:48.004 --> 12:49.060
Cheers.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.004
Ah!

13:01.088 --> 13:03.064
Don't envy you going
back to London,

13:03.077 --> 13:05.063
Craig. All those pickpockets.

13:05.064 --> 13:08.019
Yeah, well,
it's not what it was, Kevin.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.059
I mean, I'd be happy to move on,
to be honest with you.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.534
I crave a bit of excitement.
Last

13:13.547 --> 13:16.031
year, I went climbing
in Canada...

13:16.032 --> 13:20.027
Excuse me, sir.
But your card is not welcome.

13:20.028 --> 13:25.075
What? It is reject. Bad.
Do you have perhaps other card?

13:25.076 --> 13:27.008
Um...

13:28.048 --> 13:30.063
No, not on me.

13:30.064 --> 13:34.011
I don't understand. There's at
least 250 in that account.

13:34.012 --> 13:36.059
That settles it, then. I'll pay.
Hang on, hang on.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.067
I've got an AMEX card back
at the hotel.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.064
I'll phone the au pair and
get her to give me the

13:40.077 --> 13:42.083
number. I'm not sure...
Craig, there's no need.

13:42.084 --> 13:44.032
Sshh!

13:47.060 --> 13:51.067
Anoushka? Yeah, it's me.
Can you go up to my room, please?

13:51.068 --> 13:54.530
Yeah, it was very nice,
thank you. Yeah, go into my

13:54.543 --> 13:58.015
room and go over to the
bedside cabinet and open

13:58.016 --> 14:00.055
the second drawer down.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.999
No, no. Not the top one.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.088
Do not open the top one!

14:07.096 --> 14:10.027
Yeah, the second one.

14:10.028 --> 14:13.007
Right. And in there
is my AMEX card.

14:13.008 --> 14:14.059
Yes, the gold one.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.046
Now, I need the
long number on the

14:16.059 --> 14:18.055
front and the four digits just

14:18.056 --> 14:20.079
above that in the
right-hand corner.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.008
Digits.

14:23.064 --> 14:25.031
Digits!

14:25.032 --> 14:26.522
I tell you what,
why don't you just

14:26.535 --> 14:28.035
bring the card down to me?
No, no.

14:28.036 --> 14:30.051
It's fine, it's fine.

14:30.052 --> 14:32.022
No, they're fine.
They'll be fine.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.015
They're asleep, aren't they?

14:34.016 --> 14:36.055
Well, just leave quietly!

14:36.056 --> 14:37.552
Well, if you're
that worried, just

14:37.565 --> 14:39.071
unplug everything!
No, Craig! No!

14:39.072 --> 14:43.015
Don't worry, Baboushka! It's
fine! You don't have to come.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.067
Look, I appreciate what you're
trying to do,

14:45.068 --> 14:46.554
but it's daft you
putting your kids'

14:46.567 --> 14:48.063
lives in danger when I've got

14:48.064 --> 14:52.047
a good card right here.
We can split it. No.

14:52.048 --> 14:55.075
I'm getting this.
No more arguments.

14:55.076 --> 14:58.016
That is the absolute end
of the matter.

15:00.008 --> 15:02.055
Well, under these circumstances,

15:02.056 --> 15:05.007
I'd be very happy to accept
your very kind offer.

15:05.008 --> 15:07.075
Thank you, Malcolm.
Not a problem at all.

15:07.076 --> 15:09.040
Yes, thank you.

15:11.076 --> 15:15.024
All right, fine. Will you just
give us a minute, please, love?

15:18.092 --> 15:21.071
This is not the way
I wanted to do this.

15:21.072 --> 15:25.083
But I've...
I've got something to tell you.

15:25.084 --> 15:27.071
What? You've got a voucher?

15:27.072 --> 15:29.091
No.

15:29.092 --> 15:32.032
No, I've not got a voucher.

15:33.064 --> 15:35.084
I've got a brain tumour.

15:38.092 --> 15:40.075
You're joking.

15:40.076 --> 15:43.008
No, I'm not, Malcolm.
And I wish I was.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.524
It's er... inoperable
and I've got

15:47.537 --> 15:50.051
three months at
best, I'm afraid.

15:50.052 --> 15:52.071
Oh, Archie, I'm so sorry.

15:52.072 --> 15:55.039
Thanks, Kevin.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.048
That is why I wanted
to pay this meal.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.048
Sorry, Malcolm.
I should have told you sooner.

16:04.036 --> 16:05.096
Will you excuse me?

16:16.020 --> 16:19.007
Listen, Archie, um...

16:19.008 --> 16:22.044
We had someone in my office who
had something very similar.

16:23.044 --> 16:25.028
And we took him over
to Switzerland.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.036
Dignitas. No, it was Geneva.

16:29.036 --> 16:31.091
We got him one of the top
surgeons over there.

16:31.092 --> 16:34.095
He had the best
possible treatment.

16:34.096 --> 16:37.075
Did he survive?

16:37.076 --> 16:39.999
No.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.091
But he had a private room,
52-inch plasma,

16:43.092 --> 16:46.035
and all the channels.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.079
It's a nice touch.

16:47.080 --> 16:51.063
Thanks, Craig, but I've talked it
over with Susie and we want

16:51.064 --> 16:55.047
to try and make it as normal as
possible for the kids' sakes.

16:55.048 --> 16:59.015
So, if you could do me the
honour, the very great honour,

16:59.016 --> 17:04.007
of allowing me to pay that bill,
probably for the last time...

17:04.008 --> 17:06.027
Don't say that, Archie.

17:06.028 --> 17:08.000
Just... in case, Kevin.

17:09.064 --> 17:12.012
It really would mean the
world to me.

17:13.028 --> 17:14.067
Or course, Archie.

17:14.068 --> 17:16.064
Thank you.

17:21.023 --> 17:23.079
If you want, we can pay the tip.

17:25.060 --> 17:28.090
It's fine, Kevin.
I'll get all of it.

17:28.092 --> 17:34.039
It's just nice to spend what time
I've got left amongst friends.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.067
You lying fucking monster! Eh?

17:36.068 --> 17:37.564
I've just texted Susie.
She doesn't

17:37.577 --> 17:39.083
know anything about a tumour!

17:39.084 --> 17:42.091
He's lying! He's a liar!
Is this true, Archie?

17:42.092 --> 17:44.052
I haven't told her yet.
I wanted to tell

17:44.065 --> 17:46.035
you first. You said
you'd talked it over.

17:46.036 --> 17:47.544
I can't believe you'd
pretend to be dying,

17:47.557 --> 17:49.075
just so you can pay
for a tapas meal!

17:49.076 --> 17:51.048
I can't believe you'd
ring up to check! Texting

17:51.061 --> 17:53.043
a dying man's wife to
confirm his story?!

17:53.044 --> 17:56.043
You're not dying though, are you?
I can't take much more of this.

17:56.044 --> 17:59.083
How dare you try and swindle your
way into paying for this meal!

17:59.084 --> 18:02.011
You've driven me to it, Malcolm!
You're a control freak!

18:02.012 --> 18:03.038
Why can't I have a
pat on the back?

18:03.051 --> 18:04.087
Good old Archie, for a change?

18:04.088 --> 18:07.047
Swooping in and claiming every
act of generosity!

18:07.048 --> 18:09.011
You're both unbelievable!

18:09.012 --> 18:11.034
The pair of you! It's
ridiculous behaviour! Strutting

18:11.047 --> 18:13.079
around, point scoring,
I mean, it's pathetic!

18:13.080 --> 18:16.019
You're the one who was happy for
his kids to be burnt to death,

18:16.020 --> 18:18.010
just so he could flash
his gold card! What?!

18:18.023 --> 18:20.023
Right, where's that bill?
I am paying this! Right?

18:20.024 --> 18:22.510
You're not! Yes, I am!
I'm getting this!

18:22.523 --> 18:25.020
Let him go! I'm getting this!
Argh!

18:28.004 --> 18:30.004
Stop this now!

18:31.040 --> 18:33.063
Stop it or I call the police!

18:33.064 --> 18:36.051
Sorry.
There is no-one else here now.

18:36.052 --> 18:38.039
I need to close the restaurant.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.059
My manager says this meal
can be at the home.

18:41.060 --> 18:45.071
She means on the house.
Yes. Please.

18:45.072 --> 18:50.088
Let me take the bill
and we all go home.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.056
No!

18:58.016 --> 19:01.007
We're going to sort this,
once and for all.

19:01.008 --> 19:03.012
It's not about the bill.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.087
It's gone beyond that now.

19:06.088 --> 19:09.027
Look,
can't we just split it four ways?

19:09.028 --> 19:11.018
I'm happy to put in for
the drink, even though I

19:11.031 --> 19:13.031
never had any, although I
did have that Limoncello.

19:13.032 --> 19:16.024
Mind you, that was free. Miss?
Will you bring us

19:16.037 --> 19:19.039
the sharpest knife in
your kitchen, please? No!

19:19.040 --> 19:23.091
The matter is closed! There is
no bill! There's always a bill!

19:23.092 --> 19:26.051
Somebody has to pay!

19:26.052 --> 19:28.059
No!

19:28.060 --> 19:31.063
Fellas, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

19:31.064 --> 19:33.079
I would probably
advise against it.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.576
I'm sure there must
be an alternative.

19:34.589 --> 19:36.096
What is he doing, Archie?

19:38.060 --> 19:40.091
I know.

19:40.092 --> 19:45.000
Stab Scotch. Also known
as Pin Finger. Nerve...

19:46.004 --> 19:47.072
Or Five Finger Fillet.

19:50.024 --> 19:52.075
Archie and I have played
this since school.

19:52.076 --> 19:54.051
We used a compass back then.

19:54.052 --> 19:56.031
Or the sharp end of a 2B pencil.

19:56.032 --> 19:58.067
The rules are very simple.

19:58.068 --> 20:02.011
You pass the knife between each
finger and back again ten times,

20:02.012 --> 20:05.023
fastest time wins, winner pays
the bill. Agreed, Archie?

20:05.024 --> 20:06.055
If you wish, yes.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.087
Kevin, will you
time this, please?

20:08.088 --> 20:10.564
Malcolm, wait! Think
what you're doing! We've

20:10.577 --> 20:13.063
got the county semis
coming up in Doncaster.

20:13.064 --> 20:15.558
You don't want to be
butchering yourself like

20:15.571 --> 20:18.075
this! I'll be fine. I
know what I'm doing.

20:18.076 --> 20:22.027
Ahem. I'm not sure I want to go
through with this.

20:22.028 --> 20:24.043
Well, you don't have to.

20:24.044 --> 20:26.088
It's between me and Malcolm now.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.052
Tell me when.

20:50.064 --> 20:53.023
Sorry. I'm just waiting for it
to get to the top.

20:53.024 --> 20:55.038
Look, come here, I'll do
it on my phone. I cannot

20:55.051 --> 20:57.076
allow this! Don't watch, then!
Sshh, sshh, sshh!

21:00.092 --> 21:03.003
Right, are you ready?

21:03.004 --> 21:06.063
Three, two, one.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.036
Go.

21:10.052 --> 21:12.027
One.

21:12.028 --> 21:14.091
Two.

21:14.092 --> 21:16.028
Three.

21:17.072 --> 21:19.063
Four.

21:19.064 --> 21:21.075
Five.

21:21.076 --> 21:24.015
Six.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.051
Seven.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.067
Eight.

21:28.068 --> 21:29.072
Nine.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.084
Done!

21:34.092 --> 21:36.083
23 seconds.

21:36.084 --> 21:38.055
Very good.

21:38.056 --> 21:40.028
Not bad.

21:43.096 --> 21:45.064
Well done.

21:47.096 --> 21:49.075
No, this isn't fair.

21:49.076 --> 21:52.055
He might have double vision
because of his brain tumour.

21:52.056 --> 21:54.071
He hasn't got a tumour, remember?

21:54.072 --> 21:56.004
Oh, yeah. No, carry on.

21:57.072 --> 21:59.091
I'm happy to pay the bill now.

21:59.092 --> 22:02.087
And we can all go home.
No, thank you, Malcolm.

22:02.088 --> 22:05.020
I'm fine.

22:06.052 --> 22:09.004
When you're ready, Craig.

22:11.044 --> 22:17.999
Three, two, one.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.084
Go.

22:22.084 --> 22:25.003
One.

22:25.004 --> 22:26.080
Two.

22:28.088 --> 22:30.079
Three.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.019
Four.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.027
Five.

22:34.028 --> 22:36.031
How long? 15 seconds.

22:36.032 --> 22:37.999
Six.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.040
Argh!

22:40.064 --> 22:43.043
Seven. Argh! Stop it now, Archie!
You're bleeding!

22:43.044 --> 22:45.023
Make him stop!

22:45.024 --> 22:46.060
Stop it!

23:11.008 --> 23:14.063
What did you do that for?
I didn't do anything!

23:14.064 --> 23:18.095
It wasn't his fault. It was an
accident. Get me some napkins!

23:18.096 --> 23:20.076
Quick!

23:22.032 --> 23:24.006
What shall we do?
Shall we call for

23:24.019 --> 23:26.003
an ambulance? The police? What?

23:26.004 --> 23:27.087
I don't know. Is she alive?

23:27.088 --> 23:30.095
Only just.
Her windpipe's been severed.

23:30.096 --> 23:32.080
Give me that knife.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.047
Archie, what should I do?
Shall I call the police?

23:38.048 --> 23:40.079
Give me your phone.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.079
I haven't got much credit
left on it.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.044
Fine. Use it.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.999
She's dead.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.071
Oh, God, no!

23:56.072 --> 23:59.015
We've got to get our
story straight, OK?

23:59.016 --> 24:00.514
It was Archie that did
it and you were trying

24:00.527 --> 24:02.035
to stop him. I was
trying to stop him!

24:02.036 --> 24:03.544
Yeah, and that's what we'll say.
Do

24:03.557 --> 24:05.075
we mention the stab cock?
What?!

24:05.076 --> 24:08.095
The game, the fish finger.
No! It's irrelevant.

24:08.096 --> 24:11.015
We'll just say we were
arguing about the bill.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.502
All of a sudden, he
grabbed a knife,

24:12.515 --> 24:14.011
he's got cuts on
his hand anyway...

24:14.012 --> 24:15.071
Yes! Right, it's been sorted.

24:15.072 --> 24:16.546
Now, all we have
to do is disappear

24:16.559 --> 24:18.043
and this will be dealt with.

24:18.044 --> 24:22.039
What do you mean? The less you
know about it, the better.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.011
Don't let your wives and your
girlfriends see you.

24:25.012 --> 24:28.063
Get rid of your clothes.
Get clean. Have showers.

24:28.064 --> 24:30.030
Clean your showers. Sounds
like you do this on

24:30.043 --> 24:32.019
a weekly basis. You don't
spend time in prison

24:32.020 --> 24:33.534
without making contacts.
People who'll watch

24:33.547 --> 24:35.071
your back. What, when
they're trying to bum you?

24:35.072 --> 24:37.040
Fine, I'll cancel it, then.
We'll call the

24:37.053 --> 24:39.031
police instead! Guys,
look, I can't be here.

24:39.032 --> 24:42.015
This was supposed to be a tapas
meal with the badminton people.

24:42.016 --> 24:43.520
I need to be back in
London tomorrow. What

24:43.533 --> 24:45.047
about the girl? Surely,
she'll be missed.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.554
You heard what she said.
She's only just

24:46.567 --> 24:48.083
come here. She's
probably illegal anyway.

24:48.084 --> 24:50.087
It's a risk we'll have to take!

24:50.088 --> 24:52.036
Malcolm?

24:54.080 --> 24:56.056
Do it.

24:58.032 --> 25:01.051
Right, before we go,
we need to sort out the money.

25:01.052 --> 25:03.039
You can pay it, Archie!
I'm not bothered now!

25:03.040 --> 25:05.011
I'm not talking about the bill!
I mean this!

25:05.012 --> 25:06.530
The clean up! It's not
a free service, you

25:06.543 --> 25:08.071
know? I've not got a
couple of coupons!

25:08.072 --> 25:09.999
How much does he want?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.999
200. Oh, that's actually very
reasonable. Thousand.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.028
I haven't got that. It's
all right. We'll split

25:16.041 --> 25:18.079
it four ways. What?
50 grand each? Yeah.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.556
Like a diddlum. I
can get it wired

25:19.569 --> 25:21.055
tomorrow morning, first thing.

25:21.056 --> 25:23.075
Has to be cash and
he wants it tonight.

25:23.076 --> 25:27.027
That's just unrealistic! It's
half 11! Archie, one question.

25:27.028 --> 25:29.051
It's just that I didn't actually
touch the knife,

25:29.052 --> 25:30.518
so technically, I
think I probably

25:30.531 --> 25:32.007
owe less. Oh, here we go!

25:32.008 --> 25:34.027
I'm just saying that my...
Shut up, Kevin!

25:34.028 --> 25:36.071
We're all paying the same!
Oh, you've changed your tune!

25:36.072 --> 25:38.067
You were going to pay the whole
bill a minute ago!

25:38.068 --> 25:40.071
Yeah, when it was 200 quid,
not 200 grand!

25:40.072 --> 25:42.046
Stop it! We're running
out of time! It's

25:42.059 --> 25:44.043
just that I haven't got
that kind of money!

25:44.044 --> 25:46.027
I have!

25:46.028 --> 25:47.091
Anoushka.

25:47.092 --> 25:51.011
It's me again. Right, I want you
to go back into my room.

25:51.012 --> 25:54.052
Go into the right-hand wardrobe.
No, not the left one!

25:56.000 --> 25:58.011
Do NOT go in the left!

25:58.012 --> 26:01.027
Right, inside,
you'll see a grey safe.

26:01.028 --> 26:03.091
I need you to open it.

26:03.092 --> 26:06.024
The number is six.. Ow!

26:12.048 --> 26:15.080
Oh... Good... She's still alive.

26:16.096 --> 26:20.035
But we'll still need the money to
clean everything up, won't we?

26:20.036 --> 26:22.027
Forget it. It's over.

26:22.028 --> 26:23.075
She's blown it.

26:23.076 --> 26:26.055
He stood on my hand!

26:26.056 --> 26:28.052
Don't blame me! So close!
We'd have had

26:28.065 --> 26:30.071
him if you'd have
kept your mouth shut!

26:30.072 --> 26:34.039
Anoushka... I'll call you back.
What's going on?

26:34.040 --> 26:36.032
I'd have thought that was
obvious. Have you really

26:36.045 --> 26:38.047
got 200 grand in your
right-hand side wardrobe?

26:38.048 --> 26:41.011
Never mind that. I want to know
what's in the left-hand side.

26:41.012 --> 26:42.087
Archie? What is this?

26:42.088 --> 26:44.035
It's a washout.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.051
I told you it was too elaborate.
It was going fine.

26:47.052 --> 26:50.079
It was just geography. He stood
on her hand. I'm sorry, Prof.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.999
But she's going way over the top
with that accent!

26:53.000 --> 26:54.059
It's barely believable now.

26:54.060 --> 26:57.043
"Can I offer you guys to be
shot?" Oh, piss off, Jerry!

26:57.044 --> 27:00.007
You couldn't do it! And you were
the one who mentioned Susie!

27:00.008 --> 27:01.063
No names, remember?

27:01.064 --> 27:04.047
All this was a set up?
Well, the restaurant's real.

27:04.048 --> 27:07.051
We just had to pay the manager
to take the night off.

27:07.052 --> 27:09.071
And they put their prices up.
They want 1,500 now.

27:09.072 --> 27:11.039
People are such greedy bastards.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.003
You've been scamming me.
I thought we were friends.

27:15.004 --> 27:18.052
Well, see it as a holiday
bromance. And you ARE very rich.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.051
I don't know what to say.

27:22.052 --> 27:25.091
Speechless. Well, I wish she was!
He crushed my fingers!

27:25.092 --> 27:29.007
What about my fucking fingers?
All right! That's enough!

27:29.008 --> 27:31.056
Stop squabbling and abort.
Sorry, Prof.

27:33.044 --> 27:35.063
Karen?

27:35.064 --> 27:37.008
Go and clean yourself up.

27:41.044 --> 27:45.043
I'm afraid you're going to have
to give us that phone.

27:45.044 --> 27:47.019
You what? Why?

27:47.020 --> 27:49.095
Well, we can't have you going
to the police, can we?

27:49.096 --> 27:51.083
You just tried to rob me
of 200 grand!

27:51.084 --> 27:53.067
You got a free meal out of it.

27:53.068 --> 27:55.040
Hand it over.

27:59.024 --> 28:02.036
Sorry... No.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.016
I'm not going to do that.

28:17.016 --> 28:21.056
All right. Well, we've got
a bit of problem, haven't we?

28:30.020 --> 28:33.007
Anyway, we were at Lingfield...
'89, was it?

28:33.008 --> 28:35.087
No, it was later than that. Eh?
It was after Diana had died.

28:35.088 --> 28:38.039
What's she got to do with it?
I just remember. All right.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.999
Well, '99, whatever.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.011
And the Professor here had worked
out if we put this

28:42.012 --> 28:44.015
accumulator on seven races,
we could have won...

28:44.016 --> 28:45.522
How much was it, Jack?
Half a million. Half

28:45.535 --> 28:47.051
a million. Well, it
wasn't half a million.

28:47.052 --> 28:51.088
It was 469,000. Excuse me.
Can we get the bill, please?

28:54.084 --> 28:56.067
Certainly, sir.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.024
I won't be a second.
