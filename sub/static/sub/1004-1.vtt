01:36.830 --> 01:39.700
That wasn't a store robbery.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.802
That was an assassination.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.173
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.542
How do I know? (CHUCKLES)

01:48.576 --> 01:52.213
I spent a little time with
the FBI's
organized crime unit.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.548
I guess you could say that
I'm intimately knowledgeable

01:54.582 --> 01:56.617
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

01:56.650 --> 01:59.287
in the Midwest
section of this country.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.422
I know a gangland
slaying when I see one,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.524
and that's exactly
what this baby is.

02:03.557 --> 02:07.361
I'd look into it
myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

02:07.395 --> 02:10.163
Think I'll take
the private jet out

02:10.198 --> 02:12.800
and fly to Spain,
pick up the little lady.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.636
Do the subsonic tummy
bump at 30,000 feet.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.472

I know what you're gonna say,
"Jim. Jim Dodge, settle down.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.446
"Relax. You owe it to
yourself." (CHUCKLING)

02:25.479 --> 02:27.581
I'll tell you what I
tell everybody else.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.585
Any little Fraulein that
expects anything more from me

02:31.619 --> 02:33.287
than a little bit of pleasure
and a little bit of danger

02:33.321 --> 02:35.489
and a great set of pectorals,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.425
she's looking for
a fall right on her ass.

Get out of here!
Let me tell you something.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.736
If you know
what's good for you,
don't you ever come back!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.038
Wait a minute, now, Hubie.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.674
You're not gonna find someone
who has the relationship
with those animals

02:53.707 --> 02:55.443
that I do.
(BARKING CONTINUES)

02:55.476 --> 02:58.178
Listen to the dogs, Hubie.
They love me!

02:59.680 --> 03:02.783
It all started when I was 15.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.819
That's when I invented
the artificial cow heart.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.556
Oh, that was a big thing.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.792
A little before your time,
but it made all
the newspapers,

03:11.825 --> 03:14.528
ABC, NBC, CBS,
they all picked up on it,

03:14.562 --> 03:17.798
but it's more or less
a hobby for me, boys.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.001
BOY: Scoot over!

03:21.034 --> 03:23.437
(GRUNTS) Actually,

03:24.672 --> 03:28.442
today I decided that I've gone
just about as far I can go

03:28.476 --> 03:30.611
in the animal
health-care business.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.814
But that's your question.
The reason that I'm not
at work this afternoon,

03:33.847 --> 03:38.652
is because I was made an offer
that I simply cannot refuse.
I sold.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.454
Whatcha gonna do
with the cash, Jim?

03:40.488 --> 03:42.423
I don't know. Maybe
I'll invest it overseas.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.458
I've got some projects
in eastern Europe right now.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.294
I don't know. I've got
everything a man needs.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.330
Jim, you just bought
the animal hospital.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.865
How come you sold it so fast?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.969
Tax problem.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.472
And here's my
accountant right now.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.808
Earl, take a bow. (LAUGHS)

04:00.841 --> 04:04.011
20 minutes for lunch, okay?
Go buy another suit.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.347
(LAUGHS) He works for me.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.616
He's scouting some
real estate for me right now.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.018
Yeah,
but the market's real tight.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.423
I like the new uniform,
Lorraine.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.028
You know, with
the right shoes and handbag,

04:21.060 --> 04:23.397
that might be suitable
for a cocktail party.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.434
So... Question.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.803
When in
the world are you going
to start serving sashimi?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.805
Maybe when I
find out what it is.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.744
(CHUCKLES) You've
never heard of sashimi?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.912
You've got to be kidding.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.350
It's this special
Japanese fish you eat raw.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.817
With a little butter sauce,

04:43.851 --> 04:46.887
and you're ready
to go to heaven.

04:46.920 --> 04:51.925
I'd hire you in a minute
if I hadn't already
fired you so many times.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.662
Did you ever
think of leaving town?

04:55.829 --> 04:59.032
Thousands of people
over in St. Louis...

04:59.066 --> 05:02.370
Got no idea how
full of shit you are.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.641
You've been alive for
21 years, my friend.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.812

to find a place
for themselves.

Well,
I'm not like everybody else.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.586

05:18.619 --> 05:20.688

didn't you? Didn't you?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.018
Yeah.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.520
(STAMMERING)
Who told you that?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.856
Hubie Marshall
called me at work.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.991
He called you at work?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.862
That's it. Okay,
I'm gonna... I'll speak...
What'd he say?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.731
He said he fired ya!

06:37.765 --> 06:40.033
He said that?
And you believed him?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.502
Damn straight I do!

06:41.535 --> 06:46.874
With all due respect, Dad,
you're Mr. Gullible,
sometimes. (CHUCKLING)

06:46.907 --> 06:49.042
The truth of the matter is,
Dad, I resigned.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.144
I'll tell you
something else, Dad.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.179
Shut up, Jimmy!

06:52.212 --> 06:54.548
When I took the job,
I had no idea

06:54.582 --> 06:57.585
it was gonna be
a hire-fire situation.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.953
Luther Betenhauser's boy
is doing much better.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.188
What's wrong with him?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.623
Fell off his
grandfather's silo.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.891
He's got brain damage.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.092
(MUFFLED) He does not.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.794
He does, too.

tongue's gonna hang out

07:08.662 --> 07:10.197
the side of his mouth
the rest of his life.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.032
And when he dies
and they bury him,

07:12.065 --> 07:14.502
at the funeral they're
gonna put a mask on him.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.837
Do I have to listen to
this while I'm eating?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.607
Let's talk about
something else.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.080
Josie McClellan
moved to New York.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.050
She did not. I saw her today.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.052
Well,
I don't know how you could.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.022
I heard at the bank
that she got tired
of taking care of her father,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.423
and she told him
to jump in a lake,

07:36.456 --> 07:39.893
and then she left for New York
to get her MBA in
high-fashion design

07:39.927 --> 07:42.630
at the University
of New York City.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.233
I just saw her down
at the gas station
in living color.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.936
We had a cup of java together.

07:48.969 --> 07:53.006
Well,
I'm gonna take Lou Selby's
word over yours any day.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.810
Lou Selby.
Lou Selby's a drunk.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.647
You know, for a guy who's just
lost his umpteenth job,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.615
you sure are handy
with the tongue sword.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.684
You got canned again?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.686
Well, he didn't get canned.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.755
He got fired.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.924
That's gotta be
some kind of a record.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.627
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:15.295 --> 08:17.230
Not only are you
an obnoxious slug,

08:17.264 --> 08:20.067
but you're
a freeloading obnoxious slug.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.969
Well, you should talk.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.137
What are you?
In your mid-forties
and still living at home.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.275
I'm 24, and I pay rent.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.077
JIM: So do I.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.144
You did pay rent.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.582
Dad, you mean
you're cutting my rent?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.650
Hell, no!

08:37.684 --> 08:39.251
You're not paying a rent
'cause you don't have a job

08:39.285 --> 08:40.554
and you don't have any money.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.691
You're out of school
and you live in this house,
you pay rent!

You know, getting this job,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.031
restoring your
faith and pride in me

09:24.064 --> 09:26.099
is a number-one
priority right now, Dad.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.603
Priority ought to be making
something of yourself.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.171
That's right up there.

09:31.204 --> 09:35.342
When I was your age,
I couldn't wait to get
out of my folks' house.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.946
I love living at home.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.993
I don't think this is such
a great place for
me to work, Dad.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.264
Okay,

09:57.297 --> 10:00.600
say I don't get this job,
hypothetically.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.770
Are you gonna be upset?

10:02.803 --> 10:06.073
You don't get this job,
you're on a bus to St. Louis.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.908
St. Louis?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.678
Uncle Jeff's offered
to put you to work
in his garden shop.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.412
I don't know
anything about gardening.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.948
You will learn!

10:14.982 --> 10:18.251
I'm getting
a distinct feeling that
you want me out of your life.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.254
I don't want you
out of my life.
I want you out of my house.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.892

sure I can't offer you
a coffee and a bear claw?

and I don't need one.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.222

10:55.255 --> 10:56.656
I love the darn things,
though, I tell you.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.292
You know, I got a sweet tooth,
I could eat those
things by the dozen.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.061
By the looks of it, I have.
(LAUGHS)

11:01.094 --> 11:02.763
(LAUGHS) Right.

11:02.796 --> 11:06.299

that you're considering

11:06.333 --> 11:08.902

We all are.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.872
I appreciate that.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.275
Good, then, let's cut
right to the chase, shall we?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.947

car allowance,

11:31.825 --> 11:35.095

relocating expenses.

11:35.128 --> 11:39.699

11:45.773 --> 11:47.307

11:47.340 --> 11:50.210

in my mind, and...

11:59.019 --> 12:00.220
(EXHALES)

12:08.095 --> 12:09.196
Hmm.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.968
(CHUCKLING) You've got me.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.036
(CHUCKLING)

12:16.069 --> 12:17.470

Thank you.

I'd like to buy you lunch.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.211
No, no, no.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.546
Your money's no good here.
Lunch is mine, all right?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.148
I'm not going to
argue with you.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.516
You better not.
I'm bigger than you are.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.118
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

12:31.151 --> 12:33.086
Hang on a second, will you?
I told her to hold my calls.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.521
Get it.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.123
Yeah, Peg. Uh-huh.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.827
(CHUCKLING) No, it's okay.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.261
No, he's right here
with me now. (LAUGHS)

12:41.294 --> 12:42.863
Hi, Peg. (LAUGHS)

12:42.896 --> 12:45.098
We just closed the deal.
Uh-huh.

12:45.132 --> 12:49.302
Oh, it was a slam-dunk, too.
I got him for 45.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.238
(CHUCKLING)

12:54.441 --> 12:56.276
No, he's right here.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.413
What do you mean,
he missed the plane?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.218
Then who the hell
am I talking to?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.156
(SIGHS) Oh, Lord!

13:10.924 --> 13:14.161
I'll, uh...

13:23.871 --> 13:25.138

13:29.509 --> 13:32.479
James, I'm afraid we have
a little
misunderstanding here.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.215
You see, I thought you
came in for the, uh...

13:35.248 --> 13:38.485

13:38.518 --> 13:41.054
I have you down here
as night cleanup boy.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.193
Well, I'm a little overpaid

13:46.226 --> 13:49.096
for night cleanup boy,
wouldn't you say, C.D.?
(LAUGHS)

13:50.931 --> 13:54.935
The truth is, James,
I can offer you
$4.44 per hour.

13:58.005 --> 14:01.341
Uh, four, four... $4.44...

14:01.374 --> 14:03.176
$4.44.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.145
What about the benefits?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.447
Two fifteen-minute breaks
and a half hour for lunch.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.619
And the title is,
uh, night cleanup boy?

14:13.453 --> 14:14.621
Yes.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.092
I'll take it.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.194
Oh, and, uh, lose the curl.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.165
Hello, boys.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.533
Going to Paris on an F-14.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.436
Got a little peace meeting
with the Vice-President
of Bulgaria.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.306
Business, you know?
Then I'm going to Venice,

18:26.339 --> 18:28.841
for a big spaghetti dinner
with the princess of Austria.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.578
A beautiful lady...
Really big bones.

Jim is so cool!

20:08.641 --> 20:09.642

20:11.744 --> 20:13.746
Got a loose tile here.
First thing in the morning,

20:13.780 --> 20:16.316
I want you to take
some epoxy cement
and take care of this.

Please bring all your

What did you say?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.346
I'm askin' you
a simple question.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.548
Are you lazy?
No, sir.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.816
'Cause the last guy
that wore that uniform
was a lazy slacker,

21:23.850 --> 21:25.652
and I fired his no-good butt.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.491
will I be getting my own?

(LAUGHS) You work out,
which I doubt,

21:33.893 --> 21:35.628
you can have
yourself a new name patch.

(CHUCKLES)

21:40.733 --> 21:43.403
Eh, uh... Would I be
able to have it laundered?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.372
It smells a little bit
like Darnell. (CHUCKLES)

21:45.405 --> 21:48.375
I don't think you know
who you're messin' with, boy.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.777
Right, after you clean
the ladies' and
men's crappers,

21:50.810 --> 21:52.912
I'm talking about
you'd better be able
to eat off those bowls.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.781
Oh, sure.
You clean my coffeemaker,

21:54.814 --> 21:56.449
then you wax my desk.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.651
Uh, clean what?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.453
You clean my
coffeemaker and wax my desk!

22:00.487 --> 22:02.489
I got it!

22:02.522 --> 22:04.657
You, uh, sweep the aisles,
startin' with
health and beauty,

22:04.691 --> 22:06.559
and you work your way over
to juniors and misses.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.529
Ups and downs, leaving your
debris in the cross aisles.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.663
So I start with
health and beauty...

22:10.697 --> 22:11.731
What did I just say?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.966
I just said to start
with health and beauty, okay?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.668
Then you do your cross aisles.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.537
That'll bring your
dustbin into play.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.772
You take the debris.
You load it into the dustbin.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.675
You take the dustbin out
to the loading dock area

22:22.709 --> 22:24.611
and you empty it
into the receptacle.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.845
You got that? Easy as pie.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.547
Yeah.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.549
Now, I was employed
for a brief period
at Del Taco, and...

22:29.582 --> 22:32.419
I don't care about your
Del Taco experiences, boy.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.821
All right. Now,
we've got this little problem
in this store with grazers.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.656
You know what
a grazer is, boy?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.825
Is that some
sort of farm term?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.660
A grazer is
a customer or an employee

22:40.693 --> 22:42.429
that eats off the shelves,
okay?

22:42.462 --> 22:45.097
Sort of similar
to a cow grazing
in a field of grass.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.800
Only this isn't
a field of grass, okay,
and you're not a cow.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.503
There's no eatin'.
You're not being
paid to eat, so don't!

22:50.537 --> 22:51.871
You got any questions?

22:51.904 --> 22:53.406
Not right offhand, no.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.807
You think you can handle it?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.142
Oh, I'll give it
the old college try.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.810
Don't touch me!

22:58.811 --> 23:01.113
Well,
despite our age difference,

23:01.147 --> 23:02.449
I think I'm really gonna
enjoy working with you.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.017
Let's get
something straight, boy.
You ain't workin' with me.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.986
You're working for me.
(EXCLAIMS)

23:07.019 --> 23:09.722
Still,
I think it's gonna be fun
being around you.

23:09.756 --> 23:10.990
Yeah, I ain't gonna
be anywhere near you.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.793
I'm gonna be home

out of Colleen Jackson.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.596
Hell, no.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.834
I'm gonna be here by myself?

23:21.868 --> 23:25.605
Yeah, that's right!
And you'd better stay out
of the ladies' undergoods.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.543
Wait a minute.
Nobody told me
I'd be here alone.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.878
What are you doing?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.179
Saving money.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.147
Wait a minute. Are you
turning off the lights?

23:35.181 --> 23:37.750
In 25 seconds, you got light
in every third aisle.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.951
When the sun
comes up, you turn off

23:38.985 --> 23:39.886
all the lights.
You understand?

23:41.087 --> 23:44.023
No, I don't understand.
Just hold on a second!

What if there's a fire?

24:02.609 --> 24:03.843
Then the fire
department will come.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.424
Well, sir,
she didn't leave on the bus.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.594
Apparently, she isn't here.
Let's go look for
her someplace else.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.131
She wouldn't be dumb
enough to thumb, would she?

32:12.164 --> 32:15.534
Does she have any friends
that she might
have run off with?

32:16.235 --> 32:17.603
Boyfriends?

32:17.636 --> 32:21.407
Would you just get in the car
so we can go look
for the girl, please?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.442
I'm tired,
I had to get out of the bed,

32:23.475 --> 32:25.477
I haven't had any coffee.
I don't feel good.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.979
My daughter, I don't know
where the hell she is.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.580
And you're
standing by the car there,

32:28.614 --> 32:30.449
sounding like some goddamn
preacher or something!

32:30.482 --> 32:32.151
Come on. Get in the car!

32:34.020 --> 32:35.154
Prick.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.294
Are you sure you
didn't hurt yourself?

32:42.328 --> 32:45.064
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

32:45.097 --> 32:47.499
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.035
Can I ask what you were doing?

32:49.068 --> 32:51.037
Uh...
Oh, I was roller-skating.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.472
I know, but why?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.574
Oh, why not?

32:55.607 --> 32:59.311
I got bored. One thing
led to another and...

32:59.345 --> 33:02.414
And I'm roller-skating
in my shorts. (CHUCKLES)

33:02.448 --> 33:04.616
Better question would be,
"What are you doing here?"

33:05.451 --> 33:07.186
Shopping.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.688
Well, we've been
closed for five hours.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.091
Yeah. I fell asleep.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.492
While shopping?

33:13.525 --> 33:15.194
No,
in the ladies' dressing room.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.664
That makes no sense.
You're
a high-profile young ingenue.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.499
I was debating...
What?

33:20.532 --> 33:24.036
Whether or not to get
arrested for shoplifting.

33:24.070 --> 33:27.173
Doesn't your father own, like,
$10 million worth of
real estate in this town?

33:27.206 --> 33:28.807
Well, it's not my fault.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.609
No, no, I didn't imply such.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.812
It just seems funny
that someone of your...

33:33.845 --> 33:35.614
Wealth?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.349
If you will.
Would be shoplifting...

33:37.383 --> 33:39.718
I didn't do it.
I chickened out.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.455
Would consider shoplifting.

33:43.489 --> 33:47.226
It's a long,
dull, self-indulgent,
highly unromantic story

33:47.259 --> 33:49.628
about an overbearing father,

33:49.661 --> 33:51.797
deceased mother and brother

33:51.830 --> 33:55.501
and a completely confused girl
who looks a little like me.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.414
(EXCLAIMS)

34:09.148 --> 34:10.248
(SIGHS)

34:33.371 --> 34:36.175
I sure am glad you dropped by.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.810
I was getting pretty
tired of being with myself.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.684
I guess...
I guess, I'm what you
call a people person.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.222
What are you cooking?

34:50.255 --> 34:51.357
Uh, Hobo Chicken.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.659
It's a glazed
chicken in wine sauce

34:53.692 --> 34:56.594
with vegetables
and skin-on potatoes.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.730
Silverware... Silverware...

35:02.234 --> 35:04.170
It's only 210 calories.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.405
And I don't know
if you're watching

35:06.438 --> 35:08.574
your figure, but I sure am.
(CHUCKLES)

35:08.607 --> 35:10.742
Uh, if you can just
grab a serving spoon

35:10.776 --> 35:12.844
over there,
I think we'll be set.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.419
Uh, keep your
distance from these things.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.588
I think it's safe
to keep five feet.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.122
(BELL DINGS)

35:27.626 --> 35:29.728
I think they're about done.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.366
Well,
dining room's right this way.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.570
Mmm!

35:38.870 --> 35:41.540
Mmm. Oh.

35:41.573 --> 35:45.211
I think my father poured
the cement for your pool.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.548
He's a cement contractor.
Good man.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.318
Bud Dodge?

35:52.351 --> 35:54.953
My mother works at Hoenicker's
over Christmas, part time.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.855
My sister's
a teller at the bank.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.758
My brother's in grade school.
He's not
employed at the moment.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.561
I used to work at
the animal shelter.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.931
But I was terminated.
And now...
Now I'm working here.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.236
Do you always talk this much?

36:12.804 --> 36:15.374
Yeah, I guess I do.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.409
I like talking to people.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.780
I was thinking maybe
you should go into sales.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.181
I've actually tried that.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.824
Some fresh ground pepper?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.360
Please.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.630
Some people don't
like a lot of pepper.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.432
Say when.
That's fine.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.435
I happen to
really like it a lot.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.838
I think it enhances
the natural flavor
of the chicken.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.312
I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.315
I've had dreams about you.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.450
You've had dreams about me?

36:59.985 --> 37:01.553
Not recently.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.689
I've had dreams
about you in the past.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.292
I've had dreams about
entire cheerleading squads,

37:06.325 --> 37:08.360
so don't get me wrong.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.562
It's kid stuff, you know.
How 'bout you?

37:10.596 --> 37:11.930
Do I dream?
Mmm.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.368
That's about all I do.

37:30.382 --> 37:33.785
ROGER:
Raisin' a kid's hard work.
You got any kids?

37:33.819 --> 37:36.688
No, sir. No, sir.
And from
listening to you talking

37:36.722 --> 37:38.590
and from observin' this,

37:38.624 --> 37:41.760
I'm kinda grateful old Emily
turned up infertile.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.747
Shouldn't you be
cleaning up the store?

38:02.648 --> 38:04.015
I got plenty of time.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.685
Big store.
Huge.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.988
Always smoke cigars?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.959
I enjoy a good one
after a fine meal.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.927
It settles the stomach.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.797
You're the town liar, right?

38:23.769 --> 38:24.870
What?

38:24.903 --> 38:28.907
I'm sorry.
That really came out wrong.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.642
I don't see how
something like that
could come out right.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.010
I guess I meant that's
what people call you.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.512
But I didn't mean to imply
that it's actually true.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.680
People are
actually calling me that?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.382
I thought you knew.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.783
Know what?
That I was the town liar?

38:37.816 --> 38:38.984
You didn't?

38:39.017 --> 38:40.051
No. I'm not.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.920
I think that you might have
the wrong information.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.054
I didn't mean to offend you.

38:44.523 --> 38:45.857
Did you think that
was a compliment?

38:45.891 --> 38:47.993
No. No. And I apologize.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.696
You know, I can't
repeat things like that.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.365
Don't think about it.
It's all right.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.834
As I said, I think you've got
the wrong information.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.836
But, if people
are calling me that,

38:57.869 --> 39:00.539
it's only
because they're small,
cheap, petty, and jealous.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.941
Small towns are notorious
for that kinda thing.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.142
I'm sure
there's a word for me.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.677
Oh, yeah. Sure.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.845
What do they call me?

39:06.878 --> 39:08.046
A tease.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.548
Tease?

39:11.483 --> 39:13.785
Yeah, I can see that.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.086
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.789
Actually, I never teased.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.058
This is becoming amusing.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.960
Who exactly calls me a liar?

39:21.993 --> 39:23.862
Everybody.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.564
Everybody.
No, not everybody.

39:25.597 --> 39:26.965
I'm sure there's
some old people in town.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.500
Right.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.508
Well, what do you think?

39:36.542 --> 39:38.009
What do I think?

39:40.011 --> 39:41.880
Do you think I'm a liar?

39:41.913 --> 39:44.015
Well,
I don't know you well enough.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.819
You've known me
for almost 17 years.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.121
We went to the same schools
from kindergarten on up.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.891
I knew of you,
but I didn't
know you personally.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.194
That's always bothered me.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.931
I mean, that old "in-out,
us-them" thing.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.500
That's the way it's been.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.834
I know.
It's always bothered me.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.170
Sure, but it's
water over the dam now.

40:05.203 --> 40:08.607
(SIGHS) Yeah, but it's
your dam and my water.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.442
I got crapped on
a lot of years.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.611
I just meant that
it's in the past.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.481
Well, the present is
a result of the past.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.683
I look at my high
school yearbook,

40:17.716 --> 40:20.752
and I don't see
four fabulous years.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.921
Actually, what I'm reminded of
is what it feels like

40:22.954 --> 40:25.023
to have my
underwear yanked up my ass

40:25.056 --> 40:27.526
by some big football player
with arms like
telephone poles.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.928
Okay,
and where are those guys now?

40:31.663 --> 40:36.067
I know they're not
working nights at Target.
I'll tell you that. (LAUGHS)

40:36.101 --> 40:38.904
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. You know,

40:38.937 --> 40:40.906
I look at my yearbook

40:40.939 --> 40:44.142
and I see four fabulous years

40:45.777 --> 40:47.679
that are gonna be
the highlight of my life.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.781
Here's what it's like...

40:49.815 --> 40:53.018
First,
you feel a hand going down
the back of your pants

40:53.051 --> 40:54.786
and tighten around
the elastic waistband...

40:54.820 --> 40:56.522
Highlight.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.189
Sometimes I'd
actually see stars.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.958
It's not going
to get any better.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.594
And if I was
particularly unlucky,

41:02.628 --> 41:04.963
my shorts would like
rip completely free

41:04.996 --> 41:06.498
and I would get this
really drastic fabric...

41:06.532 --> 41:07.733
Jim? Do you hear me?

41:10.736 --> 41:11.837
Yeah.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.877
I don't really care
about a graphic description
of a childhood prank.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.112
Hey, that prank was
a motif in my life.

41:25.751 --> 41:29.254
You know,
I'm locked in this store here

41:29.287 --> 41:32.257
because I didn't have
the guts to steal a skirt,

41:32.290 --> 41:35.126
so I could get arrested
and embarrass my father

41:35.160 --> 41:37.796
in this stupid,
desperate, childish,

41:37.829 --> 41:39.931
pathetic
attempt to leave home.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.568
(SMIRKS) And you
have your underwear
yanked up your ass.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.503
I have my entire
life yanked up my ass.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.274
Well,
you're speaking figuratively.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.543
I was speaking literally.
And you're happy.

41:51.577 --> 41:52.744
You know, you're happy.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.581
I'm not happy.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.115
I'm working nights.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.718
Uh,
everybody thinks I'm a liar.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.286
My whole
family's laughing at me.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.655
Reverend Harwell gave me
the finger last week.

42:03.689 --> 42:04.956
Okay, okay, you're not happy,

42:04.990 --> 42:06.725
but at least you have
some control over your life.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.694
So do you.
My father controls my life.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.129
You're over 18.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.098
You can tell him to drop dead,
and get on a plane.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.265
So can you.

42:14.299 --> 42:15.567
I don't want to.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.070
I like living at home.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.305
No, you don't.

42:20.338 --> 42:23.174
What am I, a garden snail?

42:24.309 --> 42:26.277
An involuntary
muscle in a janitor suit?

42:26.311 --> 42:28.046
I,
uh, I know what I want to do.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.616
What could you possibly like

42:30.649 --> 42:32.951
about living at
home at your age?

42:32.984 --> 42:37.055
The meals are great.
I mean, there's the, uh...
There's cable.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.827
Um, the accommodations
are excellent, five-star.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.829
What do you care if I'm
living at home or not?

42:45.063 --> 42:47.833
Hey, I didn't come
here to irritate you.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.334
Well, you're beginning to.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.774
(SIGHS) Great.
That's really great.

42:55.807 --> 42:58.777
I gotta stop saying
those kinds of things.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.312
Those freakin' kids!
I knew I couldn't trust 'em.

43:01.346 --> 43:04.650
Town liar.
That's a nice rep. Nice rep.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.351
I bet it was Gregory,
that little weasel.

43:06.384 --> 43:08.253
Top secret,
top secret, I tell 'em,

43:08.286 --> 43:10.055
and they still
shoot off their mouths!

43:10.088 --> 43:12.123
If I'd really
been a French spy,

43:12.157 --> 43:14.626
those little tots
would've gotten me killed!

43:14.660 --> 43:16.394
Piano wire
wrapped around my neck.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.129
My testicles
shoved down my throat,

43:18.163 --> 43:20.165
a piece of
dynamite stuck up my ass.

43:24.135 --> 43:26.171
(SIGHS)

43:26.204 --> 43:27.639
She's so beautiful.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.609

JOSIE: (OVER P.A.)
Jim, there's no
reason to lie right now.

45:19.818 --> 45:22.187
There's no one to impress.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.955
You know,
I'm not impressed by a man

45:23.989 --> 45:25.791
telling me he
likes living at home.

45:25.824 --> 45:29.127
Excuse me. I'm not lying,

45:29.160 --> 45:31.262
and I'm not
trying to impress you.

45:31.296 --> 45:33.431
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

45:33.464 --> 45:36.001
I have to clean dead flies
out of the lighting fixtures.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.204
Okay, okay, my error.
I apologize.

45:39.237 --> 45:43.174
It's just that I
can't imagine a man,

45:43.208 --> 45:46.444
giving up his independence,
his right to mate,

45:47.245 --> 45:49.080
to have a family,

45:49.114 --> 45:52.450
to have children,
to build a life for himself,

45:52.483 --> 45:53.819
for good cooking.

45:53.852 --> 45:55.086
Hold on.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.956
I have not given
up my right to mate.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.225
(CHUCKLES) I have
the right to mate

46:00.258 --> 46:03.261
anytime I feel like mating.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.864
You go out with someone.

46:05.897 --> 46:07.498
You bring her home.

46:07.532 --> 46:09.534
You introduce her to...

46:09.567 --> 46:12.770
Mom, Dad, sis, Billy,

46:13.304 --> 46:14.973
Woofie the dog.

46:15.006 --> 46:16.875
Cocktails in
the rumpus room, and then

46:17.843 --> 46:19.310
do it on the bunk bed?

46:19.544 --> 46:21.279
Oh,

46:21.312 --> 46:23.114
let's analyze that remark.

46:23.882 --> 46:25.550
First, I don't have a dog,

46:25.583 --> 46:27.285
my brother's not named Billy,

46:27.318 --> 46:30.421
and I don't even
have a rumpus room.
So I don't even...

46:30.455 --> 46:32.023
JOSIE: You know what I mean.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.831
Yeah, I know what you mean.

46:40.966 --> 46:42.567
Spit on me,
make me feel lousy.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.909
Jim?

46:52.277 --> 46:54.412
You said something
that wasn't true.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.015
No.

46:57.048 --> 47:01.519
No, I said that I can
have sex when I want to,

47:01.552 --> 47:04.389
and I do. I do.

47:04.422 --> 47:07.425
However, I was
looking forward to a nice,
quiet evening of janitoring.

47:10.195 --> 47:12.030
I don't think you see
what I'm getting at.

47:12.597 --> 47:14.532
I see what you're getting at.

47:14.565 --> 47:17.202
I'm a lying monk
with an Oedipus complex

47:17.235 --> 47:18.236
and an appetite
for home cooking.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.138
Don't forget. You're
the indecisive shoplifter.

47:20.171 --> 47:22.140
Yes! Exactly!

47:22.173 --> 47:24.242
I would do anything
to be in your shoes.

47:25.043 --> 47:27.445
These are Darnell's shoes.

47:27.478 --> 47:30.148
You know, you have freedom,
and you're not using it.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.284
It makes me sad.

47:33.318 --> 47:35.921
Well, you have
the collective wealth
of the entire town,

47:35.954 --> 47:38.556
and you're trying to
get yourself arrested.
Now, that makes me sad.

47:38.589 --> 47:40.591
That makes me sad, too.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.060
That's pretty stupid.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.261
It's very stupid.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.464
Are you serious?

47:46.497 --> 47:48.900
I mean,
you haven't been drinking?

47:48.934 --> 47:50.501
This isn't the bottle talking?

47:51.369 --> 47:52.603
No.

47:53.604 --> 47:56.341
Then why don't you
just talk to the guy?

47:58.509 --> 48:01.412
For the same reason
that you can't leave home,

48:01.446 --> 48:03.381
I can't tell my
father to go to hell.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.451
Why not?

48:09.287 --> 48:12.123
Because I don't
want to be alone.

48:32.443 --> 48:33.911
(GRUNTING)

48:39.985 --> 48:41.419
Mr. McClellan?

48:43.054 --> 48:46.057
You ever have any
family problems,
you and your daughter?

48:47.225 --> 48:49.194
What the hell do
you think this is?

48:51.129 --> 48:52.397
You got a point.

48:58.336 --> 49:00.038
Would you go
with me somewhere?

49:03.074 --> 49:04.542
Where?
Florida?

49:05.310 --> 49:07.412
Wyoming? Spain?

49:07.445 --> 49:09.580
It doesn't really matter,
just away somewhere.

49:11.182 --> 49:12.550
I'd love to.

49:13.384 --> 49:16.087
I just can't afford to be

49:16.121 --> 49:18.189
capricious and
carefree like yourself.

49:18.223 --> 49:21.993
I, uh, I've gotta set
my sights on something
and really go for it.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.429
Night janitor?

49:25.430 --> 49:27.432
It's a beginning.
I'm looking at...

49:27.465 --> 49:29.134
It's an end.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.704
Maybe if you had,
like, a destination in mind,

49:33.738 --> 49:36.107
that would make
all
the difference in the world.

49:37.208 --> 49:39.310
Why?

49:39.344 --> 49:41.712
Well,
uh, I'm, uh, I'm just not

49:41.746 --> 49:44.215
built to
aimlessly roam the world.

49:44.249 --> 49:46.484
(STAMMERING) I'm too
conservative for that.

49:48.086 --> 49:49.754
Well,

49:49.787 --> 49:52.057
I was thinking
about Los Angeles.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.125
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.461
What for?

49:56.494 --> 49:57.495
Live. Work.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.066
At what?
Whatever.

50:01.699 --> 50:03.734
And what about your father?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.372
When I don't die,

50:07.405 --> 50:10.575
he'll realize that I
can make it on my own.

50:10.608 --> 50:14.712
If I do,
he'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that I can't.

50:14.745 --> 50:18.216
If I run and he
brings me back,
or if I go back on my own,

50:18.249 --> 50:19.784
either way he's just,
uh, gonna beat
the shit out of me.

50:19.817 --> 50:21.586
So it doesn't
really make a difference.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.121
What, uh, literally?

50:26.724 --> 50:27.725
Yeah.

50:29.260 --> 50:30.495
Sad.

50:31.496 --> 50:32.763
Yeah, it's sad.

50:32.797 --> 50:35.266
Until he throws you
across the room, it's sad.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.768
I'm just afraid
to live with him,

50:37.802 --> 50:39.537
and I'm afraid to
live without... You know,

50:39.570 --> 50:42.507
you didn't come to
work to hear this stuff.
I'm really sorry.

50:42.540 --> 50:43.774
That's all right.

50:43.808 --> 50:45.143
I'm gonna clean this up.

50:53.318 --> 50:55.353
I'm, uh, I'm just surprised.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.288
I thought everything
was okay, you know.

50:58.289 --> 50:59.557
I figured you got
a nice car, you got

50:59.590 --> 51:00.791
a nice house,
you got some money.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.327
Everything's okay.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.129
It should be,

51:04.162 --> 51:05.630
but it's not.

51:05.663 --> 51:07.665
It's twisted,
and it's distorted,

51:07.698 --> 51:10.401
and it can't be changed,
and it cannot be saved.

51:17.875 --> 51:19.344
I'll go with you.

51:24.649 --> 51:26.217
Really?

51:27.285 --> 51:28.453
Yeah.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.856
We have to get a car.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.260
Let's get through the night,
first.

51:35.293 --> 51:36.627
I have money.

51:36.661 --> 51:37.762
How much?

51:37.795 --> 51:39.464
$52,000.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.201

I've never seen so
much money in my life.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.692
(SNIFFS) This is
more than my house cost.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.262
Jim,

52:11.296 --> 52:13.431
now that I'm
spending the night,

52:13.464 --> 52:15.166
how can I pay you back

52:15.200 --> 52:17.468
for being so cold to
you in high school?

52:20.371 --> 52:22.207
Do you need
an answer right away?

52:22.473 --> 52:23.641
No.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.511
Sometime before
the sun comes up.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.516
Well, uh,

52:32.517 --> 52:34.485
you're probably not
going to remember this,

52:34.719 --> 52:36.887
but, uh,

52:36.921 --> 52:39.590
there was a homecoming dance
our sophomore year.

52:39.624 --> 52:40.825
Mmm-hmm.

52:40.858 --> 52:42.227
Do you remember Mrs. Noble?

52:43.394 --> 52:45.896
Large, hairy gym teacher

52:45.930 --> 52:47.798
with a suspiciously
cumbersome groin bulge?

52:47.832 --> 52:49.600
I had her for two years.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.202
Well, she made
everybody switch partners

52:51.236 --> 52:52.503
because all the fat girls
were dancing together,

52:52.537 --> 52:54.205
and the doinks,
myself included,

52:54.239 --> 52:55.640
were standing
against the wall,

52:55.673 --> 52:57.808
blowing spit bubbles.
Right.

52:57.842 --> 53:03.614
Well, uh, for three-quarters
of one verse of a slow song,

53:05.250 --> 53:06.484
we danced together.

53:08.253 --> 53:09.520
You reeked of Stridex.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.423
Oh, no, that was Larry Fry.

53:13.691 --> 53:14.925
I'm sorry.

53:16.394 --> 53:17.528
I don't remember.

53:17.562 --> 53:19.564
Well...

53:19.597 --> 53:21.499
You got your hair
caught in my braces.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.668
I don't remember.

53:23.701 --> 53:24.969
Well, it's not important.

53:27.672 --> 53:28.973
I had...

53:29.006 --> 53:30.675
Well, I just always...

53:31.776 --> 53:33.711
Dreamed of
finishing that dance.

53:36.981 --> 53:37.982
Okay.

53:41.452 --> 53:44.922
Oh, don't, uh, don't feel
you have to answer right away.
(LAUGHS)

53:44.955 --> 53:48.493
It's just a small portion
of my life that's incomplete.

53:48.526 --> 53:50.695

something different.

53:56.867 --> 53:58.436

Oh!

Ah, matter of fact,
I just saw her yesterday,
yeah.

I only work nights.

she's missing.

her and I come past.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.425
JOSIE:
Do you want to get on top?

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.103
You check the office.
I'll scope the dressing rooms.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.471
Right.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.481
You're on top.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.218
Did you want to be on top?

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.120
Oh, no.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.823
No,
no, uh, I'm fine where I am.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.357
Sure.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.065
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:44.228
(WHISPERING) Ow, ow, ow.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:47.898
I think he went to the back.

Evening.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:07.417
NESTOR: Nice.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.286
Excellent.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.522
Hey, you got a tattoo?

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.226
JIM: No, sir.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.862
Not you, asshole!

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.930
I'm a missing person.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.432
The whole town
is looking for me.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.402
What, are you hidin' out?
Yes.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:27.905
And I would appreciate
it if you'd let us sit up.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.806
What about the tattoo?

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.542
I don't have one.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.011
You owe me a buck.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.179
Actually, it's up to two.

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:38.248
I borrowed that one
off you at Burger King.
(MUTTERING)

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.917
Excuse me.
(GUN COCKING)

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.888
Are you planning to shoot us
in the back of the head?

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:46.456
We haven't
decided yet, have we?

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:49.493
Who are you?

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:52.296
Uh, you don't want to know.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.865
He wouldn't have asked
if he didn't want
to know, butthead.

01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:56.633
He's a little crazy.
He's my brother.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.468
He's not quite right.
That's not true.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.570
She doesn't even know me.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:02.239
Somebody better start
talking straight here.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.607
That's the truth.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.976
Okay.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.846
You want to know?

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:12.616
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, good.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.985
But, uh...

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.155
Come on over here.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.491
What?
JIM: Come on over.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.460
Come on over here! Over here.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:41.178
(COUGHS)

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.980
Come on down here.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.551
That's right.
Down here. Down here.

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:49.453
Uh-huh?

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:51.989
Okay.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.993
You dumb sons of bitches.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:00.064
Do you realize that
you have just walked

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.500
straight into a $60-million
drug transaction?

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.335
(GUN COCKING)

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:07.337
NESTOR:
So, you're running this

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:11.141
multi-zillion-dollar
drug transaction by yourself?

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:13.010
Little Target boy.

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.112
No.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.647
No,
I'm not doing it by myself.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.349
Oh, no, no.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.086
As a matter of fact,

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.522
in about 10 minutes,

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:28.692
this place is gonna be
alive with the meanest,

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:32.362
ugliest,
most impatient animals
you guys have ever seen.

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:35.665
So I'll tell you what,
I'll give you
five minutes to take

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:38.435
whatever you want
in the whole store.
Anything you want and just go.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:41.405
I won't tell. Just go.
Just take your guns and go.
Scoot.

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.974
Okay, then, who's the girl?

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.477
I'm his hostage.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:48.578
Yes, yes.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:52.682
Is that true? Hmm?

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:55.185
Yes! Yes, it's true.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.354
And, um...

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.526
If the deal doesn't go down,

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.561
she becomes pig feed.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:05.695
Bullshit.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.597
Oh, really?

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:11.768
Well, blow her away.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.038

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:15.305
(GRUNTING)

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.640
Okay.

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:21.511
Then give me your guns
and I'll do it for you.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:23.747
It's bullshit, right?

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.017
NESTOR: We'll see.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.221
Roll over.

01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:32.622
Come on, you heard him.
What?

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.658
Roll over!
That's right. You too, honey.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.161
You heard me.
Roll over. Come on, do it!

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:40.730
Come on, come on!
Roll! Roll. That's it.
Very good.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:44.201
Mmm! Yeah.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:47.171
Um, give me the guns.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.738
Ah!

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.374
No way, man. Uh-uh.

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.176
Fine. Fine.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:54.244
You do it. I don't
need her anymore, anyway.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:57.314
I only needed her to
get through customs.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.049
I don't like this.

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:00.584
This sucks. It's not worth it.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.219
Come on, we don't
have much time. Do it!

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:03.553
All right.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.226
It's nothing personal.

Too late. They're here!

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.364
It's too late. They're here.

It's the girl
you want, not us!

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:29.646
Just relax, okay.
Ned, we got a WD-40.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.248

putting down the guns.

lives are at stake here.

Now, get back, get back.

a surprise for you, too.

You're full of shit.

I think everybody at
one time in their life
is full of shit.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.442
I'll throw on
a couple of corn dogs

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.544
and we'll all get
to know each other.

goes on inside your heads.

the big one, you had the...

No.

Sorry. I could've
sworn you had the big one.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.488
Ha!

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.792
I lied.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:55.665
These are the men that
killed that guy in Saltburg.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.269
I'm fairly sure
that we're gonna die.

01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:00.904
I just want to tell
you how disappointed I am

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:02.738
that we're not going
to California together.

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.508
We're not dead yet.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.345
Pretty darn close.
No.

If I can get them
to take me with them,

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.350
maybe I can get away
and come back for you.

whatever I do, okay?

I might need more
than just a quarter.

You know...
No.

down in the back.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.596
You certainly don't
know anything about him.

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:20.997
These are
hardened criminals here!

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.099
Okay, come here.
That's enough.
That's enough!

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.133
Gil.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:29.205
Don't waste your time.
You could get a hernia.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.541
You know,
if my foot could talk,

01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:34.544
it would say,
"May I please go
up this geek's ass?"

01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:35.712
NESTOR: Forget him!
Forget him.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.013
GIL: Come on! All right.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:40.016
He's no use to us.
After all, the guy's
built like an oyster.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.651
Listen, little mister.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.922
If you tell on us,

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:47.190
I'll kill you.

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:54.598
Fine.

01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:01.538
Jim.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:11.648
Don't be an ass.

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:16.820
Okay, Jimbo?
(PATTING JIM'S BACK)

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.757
Let's go, shall we?

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.246
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:49.719
GIL: Ahem.

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:52.055
Come on, come on, come on!

01:14:58.728 --> 01:14:59.863
(GRUNTING)

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.502
(GRUNTS)

01:15:10.774 --> 01:15:13.142
I got 'em.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:23.286
(GUNSHOTS)

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:39.295
JIM: (OVER P.A.) That
wasn't a store robbery.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.765
That was an assassination.

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:43.800
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.770
How do I know?

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:50.039
I spent a little time with
the FBI's
organized crime unit.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:52.008
I guess you could say
that I'm
intimately knowledgeable

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.910
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.713
in the Midwest
section of this country.

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:59.415
Let me just say,
I know a gangland slaying
when I see one,

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.117
and that's exactly
what this baby is.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:06.890
I'd look into
myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:17.333
Attention Target shoppers.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.004
(SHOTGUN BLASTS)

01:17:30.914 --> 01:17:32.348
(YAWNING)

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.682
Jim!

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:04.107
He is so cool.
