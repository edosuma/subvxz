[Bill] <i>Previously on "Roadies..."</i>

00:17.619 --> 00:18.986
[Milo] <i>Kelly Ann to eight.</i>

00:18.988 --> 00:20.155
Go for Kelly Ann.

00:20.157 --> 00:22.326
Nobody thinks you're leaving.

00:22.328 --> 00:24.731
I'm going to film school.
I'm going to film school.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.502
Can you stay one more
night and nanny Winston?

00:26.504 --> 00:29.106
I got this ticket and I got
to be on a red-eye at 11:00.

00:29.108 --> 00:30.141
What are you leaving us for?

00:30.143 --> 00:32.279
How can you leave your band?

00:32.281 --> 00:34.784
They barely even gave me
a nickname and I hate it.

00:34.786 --> 00:36.655
[Bill] <i>Management
calling this early?</i>

00:36.657 --> 00:38.091
Now he's sending someone?

00:38.093 --> 00:39.961
A new financial advisor.

00:39.963 --> 00:41.598
No, I'm actually looking for Phil.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.136
Hello, Head and The Heart!
Welcome to the family!

00:44.138 --> 00:46.508
I don't hear the music the same way.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.444
<i>I don't feel like it's mine anymore.</i>

00:48.446 --> 00:50.048
[Phil] <i>It comes and
goes, sweetheart.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:52.453
<i>But if you love the music,</i>

00:52.455 --> 00:54.691
<i>and I know you do,</i>

00:54.693 --> 00:56.193
you might want to give
it all another chance.

00:56.195 --> 00:57.797

00:57.799 --> 01:01.638
<i>♪ Is all I need to know ♪</i>

01:01.640 --> 01:03.074
I want my job back.

01:03.076 --> 01:05.245
This ain't a good time to un-quit.

01:05.247 --> 01:07.517
You are invited to leave the organization.

01:07.519 --> 01:09.487
- Now.
- Let me just caution...

01:09.489 --> 01:10.456
- Oh, God! Down, down!

[Wesley] <i>What the fuck?</i>

01:24.653 --> 01:26.521
[Milo] <i>I can't believe
he did it again.</i>

01:26.523 --> 01:28.792
[Kelly Ann] <i>You guys talking
about the fingertips kiss?</i>

01:28.794 --> 01:30.295
[Donna] Could be unconscious, like,

01:30.297 --> 01:31.865
maybe he doesn't even know he's doing it.

01:31.867 --> 01:34.003
It's guilt, man. That British douchebag

01:34.005 --> 01:35.506
just broomed a bunch of his crew.

01:35.508 --> 01:37.209
He subconsciously feels guilt.

01:37.211 --> 01:39.983
No, guilt makes you wash
your fingers, not kiss them.

01:42.722 --> 01:44.958
Somebody hid my work box
behind a fucking Zamboni.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.664
I mean, it's almost like
he's openly craving love.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.166
But not contemporary love.

01:49.168 --> 01:50.670
It's like he channeled Freddie Mercury

01:50.672 --> 01:52.807
and borrowed a stage move from 1982.

01:52.809 --> 01:54.978
- You know what I think?
- [Milo] Forget the fingertips.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.017
There's some serious
shit going on, all right?

01:58.019 --> 02:00.088
Exhibit B:

02:00.090 --> 02:03.428
One of Rick's sacred Potato Heads

02:03.430 --> 02:07.603
with a Dirty Sanchez, a
mustache made of excrement.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.839
[Wesley] Is that actual shit?

02:08.841 --> 02:10.810
It's a chunky brown crayon.

02:10.812 --> 02:12.814
The point is, Phil was our leader,

02:12.816 --> 02:13.882
and without a true leader...

02:13.884 --> 02:15.185
What about Bill?

02:15.187 --> 02:17.055
...we go to lawlessness,

02:17.057 --> 02:19.159
disorder, chaos!

02:19.161 --> 02:21.565
Exhibit A was our cases missing, all right?

02:21.567 --> 02:23.635
I mean, do you think The
Head and The Heart would dare

02:23.637 --> 02:25.906
to fuck with us if Phil was still around?

02:25.908 --> 02:27.543
You actually think

02:27.545 --> 02:29.481
The Head and The Heart hid our cases?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.983
Yes! Without Phil, a true leader,

02:30.985 --> 02:33.989
the fucking opening act
feels emb... emboldened

02:33.991 --> 02:35.425
to just take out their
petty aggressions on us.

02:35.427 --> 02:36.828
Fuck yeah!

02:36.830 --> 02:38.866
Mark my words, this
woeful lack of leadership

02:38.868 --> 02:40.368
will destroy this band.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.709
It's just the fingertips of the iceberg.

02:43.711 --> 02:45.378
- [chuckles]
- What about Bill?

02:45.380 --> 02:47.182
Bill's already cracking
from the pressure, all right?

02:47.184 --> 02:48.619
It's too much for him.

02:48.621 --> 02:49.687
Someone say there were wings?

02:49.689 --> 02:51.593
Fuck yeah! Back here!

02:53.898 --> 02:56.300
I like how you started
with B and then segued to A.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.870
- That was sick.
- Cheers, mate.

02:57.872 --> 03:00.543
- Hey, Donna...
- For the last time, you left.

03:00.545 --> 03:03.047
This is my bunk now.
You're not getting it back.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.320
But I never even left
the fucking parking lot.

03:08.026 --> 03:09.863
[Bill] <i>The band just
seem a little off.</i>

03:11.700 --> 03:14.403
They... they don't like how
you walk 'em to the stage.

03:14.405 --> 03:16.340
What? They said that?

03:16.342 --> 03:18.244
They... they miss how Phil did it.

03:18.246 --> 03:20.014
- [man] <i>Shelli?</i>
- Ugh! Go for Shelli.

03:20.016 --> 03:21.350
[man] <i>Did you find your case?</i>

03:21.352 --> 03:22.854
Yeah, yeah, we... we got 'em all back now.

03:22.856 --> 03:24.289
It's a fucking nightmare. Thank you.

03:24.291 --> 03:28.431
Strange... I mean, who
would have hidden our cases?

03:28.433 --> 03:30.569
I've got a really weird feeling
about The Head and The Heart.

03:30.571 --> 03:34.042
Hey, careful about accusing
an innocent support band.

03:34.044 --> 03:36.815
I mean, need I remind you that
a certain British douchebag

03:36.817 --> 03:40.388
has axed how many people on
this tour in the last 24 hours?

03:40.390 --> 03:42.593
- Three.
- Three other potential suspects

03:42.595 --> 03:44.731
with motive and opportunity.

03:44.733 --> 03:47.904
So I'd make sure that, you
know, you have all the facts

03:47.906 --> 03:49.139
before you start pointing fingertips.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.110
- [breathing heavily]
- What?

03:51.112 --> 03:52.279
Why are you breathing like that?

03:52.281 --> 03:53.649
Like what?

03:53.651 --> 03:55.018
This is how I breathe.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.588
The other thing?

03:56.590 --> 03:58.525
I don't really fucking care how Phil

03:58.527 --> 04:00.128
used to walk 'em to the stage.

04:00.130 --> 04:03.367
I-I-I got my own
style, you know, Shelli?

04:03.369 --> 04:06.307
I got my own way of doing
it. I say supportive stuff.

04:06.309 --> 04:07.944
I tell 'em inside jokes.

04:07.946 --> 04:11.317
I point out the fan club
honeys on the first five rows.

04:11.319 --> 04:15.659
I give 'em a little piece of
my heart every single night.

04:15.661 --> 04:17.329
I'm sorry to add to your burden.

04:17.331 --> 04:18.832
What burden?

04:18.834 --> 04:20.668
I got the greatest job in the world.

04:20.671 --> 04:22.339
This is what I signed up for.

04:22.341 --> 04:23.809
I'm big wave surfing.

04:23.811 --> 04:26.748
I'm the Laird Hamilton
of rock, and I love it.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.520
Growing up, other kids,
they were reading "Sounder."

04:29.522 --> 04:31.156
I was reading "Hammer of the Gods."

04:31.158 --> 04:32.860
[sighs]

04:32.862 --> 04:34.831
I'll see you on the bus.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.102
[panting softly]

04:37.104 --> 04:39.774
[sighs]

04:39.776 --> 04:41.478

Look, maybe just call Phil and...

06:40.149 --> 06:41.484
Call Phil?

06:41.486 --> 06:43.020
Why do I fucking need to call Phil?

06:43.022 --> 06:44.657
What do I need to call Phil for?

06:44.659 --> 06:47.128
For advice about walking them to the stage.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.299
- And then...
- [water running]

06:49.301 --> 06:50.802
And... and then what?

06:50.804 --> 06:53.140
Well, and then, while
you have him on the phone,

06:53.142 --> 06:55.679
ask if maybe he can help
us find a new opening act.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.183
W-we have zero proof that the opening act

06:58.185 --> 06:59.487
is trying to sabotage us.

06:59.489 --> 07:00.889
- Zero.
- Oh, oh, okay, no, no.

07:00.891 --> 07:02.960
I-I have Nancy Drew-ed
this shit up and down.

07:02.962 --> 07:06.968
For all those sweet
harmonies and amazing songs,

07:06.970 --> 07:08.905
they are provocateurs.

07:08.907 --> 07:11.276
And I don't know if
those passive-aggressive,

07:11.278 --> 07:13.682
seemingly kind but secretly
vicious motherfuckers...

07:13.684 --> 07:15.688
[door opens]

07:17.123 --> 07:20.294
Bathroom's free. It's all yours.

07:20.296 --> 07:23.601
Then what? Shelli, come on.

07:23.603 --> 07:24.870
Come on.

07:24.872 --> 07:27.308
They... they pranked us last night.

07:27.310 --> 07:29.379
You have to get them in line or fire them.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.316
Because that's what Phil would do, right?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.853
- Oh, no. I didn't say...
- No, you're thinking if Phil

07:32.855 --> 07:34.557
were here, none of this would've happened.

07:34.559 --> 07:35.959
This wouldn't've happened on Phil's watch.

07:35.961 --> 07:37.796
You don't know what I think. I-I...

07:37.798 --> 07:39.834
No, you thought it, because
you thought if Phil were here...

07:39.836 --> 07:42.973
There is a large man in a... in a towel.

07:42.975 --> 07:44.977
Reg, you're here early.

07:44.979 --> 07:46.313
Well, I was up most of the night.

07:46.315 --> 07:48.350
Mostly because I am finding it tough going,

07:48.352 --> 07:49.487
sleeping in a cupboard.

07:49.489 --> 07:50.756
But also... Harvey?

07:50.758 --> 07:53.193
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've, uh...

07:53.195 --> 07:55.532
...been looking at Harvey's books,

07:55.534 --> 07:57.703
and while I have cut away a
fair amount of the deadwood

07:57.705 --> 08:01.544
these last few days, as you
can see it's still not enough.

08:01.546 --> 08:04.215
I need, uh, to individually speak

08:04.217 --> 08:05.519
to each remaining crew member.

08:05.521 --> 08:06.788
The undeadwood?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.157
- [snickers]
- Yes.

08:08.159 --> 08:12.131
Yeah, we need to eliminate one more person,

08:12.133 --> 08:13.735
and I cannot, uh, determine who that is

08:13.737 --> 08:15.070
until I actually understand...

08:15.072 --> 08:16.072
- Hmm.
- [Bill] Right.

08:16.074 --> 08:17.709
...what it is you all do.

08:17.711 --> 08:20.181
Reg, look, th... that's unacceptable.

08:20.183 --> 08:21.551
- I mean, not to mention...
- That doesn't...

08:21.553 --> 08:22.753
...a waste of the crew's time.

08:22.755 --> 08:24.088
