WEBVTT

00:35.291 --> 00:38.250
I'd like an application
for club membership.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.458
(officer)
'Unit 42 to Dispatch'

01:19.542 --> 01:21.291
'requesting
immediate medical assistance'

01:21.375 --> 01:22.625
'for a female victim.'

01:22.709 --> 01:24.375
'Gunshot wound to the head.'

01:24.458 --> 01:28.500
'At the intersection
of Fifth and College. Hurry.'

02:00.000 --> 02:01.959
(male #1)
'Ms. Rush? Lilly?'

02:02.041 --> 02:05.625
'Is there someone
we should contact?'

02:24.291 --> 02:26.375
You under
the weather, Lil?

02:26.458 --> 02:28.750
Oh, I was up
late.
Paperwork.

02:29.959 --> 02:31.125
Why are we here?

02:31.208 --> 02:34.709
The ME wants us to take
a look at a Jane Doe.

02:34.792 --> 02:35.875
They just find the body?

02:35.959 --> 02:37.709
A guest
of St. Michael's Hospital.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.333
Eighteen years
on the city dime.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.166
Well, how's that
make her a homicide?

02:41.250 --> 02:42.500
She died last night.

02:42.583 --> 02:43.792
Back in '89, she got caught

02:43.875 --> 02:44.875
on the wrong side of town

02:44.959 --> 02:46.250
the wrong end of a gun.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.709
ME says death's
the result of the bullet
wound

02:48.792 --> 02:50.041
to her head.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.875
Meaning Jane Doe's
our jurisdiction.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.625
Original theory
is she's a transient

02:53.709 --> 02:55.291
some kind of altercation.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.875
- Anything new?
- Just a mysterious admirer.

02:57.959 --> 02:59.458
Leaves a care package
every month.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.709
Champagne, caviar,
Godiva chocolate.

03:01.792 --> 03:03.250
Some care package.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.834
Not that
Jane Doe
noticed.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.917
Been in one of those
persistent vegetative states

03:07.000 --> 03:08.458
since the shooting.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.083
Trapped inside her own mind.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.375
What a way to go.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.917
They let you across
the street in daylight?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.083
Prepping testimony.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.583
Some of these
medical types need coddling.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.333
And they send you?

03:21.417 --> 03:23.208
That's funny.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.917
And with that
ringing endorsement..

03:26.000 --> 03:28.083
Don't be so sensitive.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.250
I should go.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.041
Glad to see you
back on the job.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.542
Thanks.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.291
Lieutenant.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.542
Detective.

03:38.625 --> 03:42.125
[whistles]
And I thought the Cold War
was over.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.458
Now, what are
you talking about?

03:43.542 --> 03:45.750
Only thing you didn't do
was pull her pigtails.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.458
Ah.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.917
I'll meet you inside. Hmm?

04:04.250 --> 04:05.792
(female #1)
'This woman suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage'

04:05.875 --> 04:07.500
'resulting
in a massive stroke.'

04:07.583 --> 04:10.875
Bullet fragments dormant in the
brain accelerated the process.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.542
You saying
almost 20 years dying

04:12.625 --> 04:14.834
in a hospital bed
is accelerated?

04:14.917 --> 04:16.750
I'm saying
the bullet killed your
victim.

04:16.834 --> 04:19.667
- Just took some time doin'
it.
- Yeah, this we knew.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.333
Got somethin' else?

04:21.417 --> 04:23.792
As I was saying
before you decided to honor us

04:23.875 --> 04:25.458
with your presence

04:25.542 --> 04:27.583
'I believe I do.'

04:28.792 --> 04:30.166
What are we looking at?

04:30.250 --> 04:32.083
Saline breast implants.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.500
Circa 1989.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.000
Uncommon back then?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.875
Well, most of the industry
still used silicone.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.500
This...was rare.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.792
So these things expensive?

04:40.875 --> 04:43.166
Yeah...must have spent

04:43.250 --> 04:45.166
'fifteen grand on them.'

04:45.250 --> 04:47.208
A lot of money
to spend on yourself.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.166
Woman was no transient.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.667
Means someone out there
should be missing her.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.959
That or they're glad
she's finally dead.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.458
(Stillman)
Jane Doe, mid 30s

05:33.542 --> 05:36.291
found in the Badlands,
shot in the face.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.583
(Rush)
Well, cops back then figured
she was homeless.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.959
Thinking now, rich girl
gets robbed for her Cartier.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.417
Puts up a fight.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.625
Ballistics can't get much
on the bullet fragments.

05:44.709 --> 05:45.917
Probably a 9 millimeter.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.542
Hmm. Well, that narrows it down.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.583
Only witness seems to be
the victim herself.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.917
Leaves us with one photo
to identify her.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.709
'And half her face is gone.'

05:55.792 --> 05:58.125
Well, that's where
18 years helps us.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.458
Computer-generated renderings

05:59.542 --> 06:01.583
of what Jane Doe looked like
before she was shot.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.834
We're circulating them
to missing persons bureaus

06:03.917 --> 06:05.083
across the country.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.500
Pretty lady.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.709
Got something.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.500
Serial number
on the saline pouches

06:09.583 --> 06:12.250
traced back to
a Dr. Jeremy Fincher.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.959
Plastic surgeon
out of Cherry Hill, New
Jersey.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.458
Well, bring him in. Let's see
what the doctor remembers.

06:22.041 --> 06:25.208
This is Margot Chambers
from the club.

06:25.291 --> 06:28.458
We used to mingle
on the 19th hole.

06:28.542 --> 06:29.959
19th hole.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.417
That in Cherry Hill?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.291
It's anywhere my friends
Johnny and Walker reside.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.458
Gotcha.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.333
Margot came to the club,
I don't know

06:38.417 --> 06:40.041
winter of '89.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.667
Left six months later.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.291
- You two close?
- 'I wouldn't call it
that.'

06:44.375 --> 06:46.291
She came in
for breast augmentation.

06:46.375 --> 06:49.291
- I thought it was strange.
- Why is that?

06:49.375 --> 06:53.542
Margot had a classic beauty
most women would have envied.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.458
She was..

06:55.542 --> 06:58.834
...she was exquisite,
really.
Hmm.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.583
Sounds like
you were fond of her.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.083
I didn't see
the need for the
work

07:02.166 --> 07:04.834
but Margot had a way
of convincing people.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.709
Any idea
why she was so insistent?

07:06.792 --> 07:10.166
She didn't say, but a couple
of weeks after the procedure

07:10.250 --> 07:13.750
I realized she was competing
in a different league.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.667
And country club women
play dirty.

07:31.041 --> 07:33.834
You're staring
at my breasts, Jeremy.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.709
Just admiring the craftsmanship.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.667
- Yes, you do good work.
- You made it easy, Margot.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.542
I feel ashamed
to even accept money for it.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.041
[chuckles]
That's okay.
I don't intend to pay.

07:49.709 --> 07:52.083
That son of a bitch.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.542
Hi, Margot.

08:04.625 --> 08:07.542
Don't "Hi, Margot" me,
you little hussy.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.000
Excuse me.

08:09.083 --> 08:12.041
Your husband aware you're
a full-service operation,
dear?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.959
Ms. Chambers, I think
you've had too much to
drink.

08:14.041 --> 08:15.875
What's she do
for you that I don't?

08:15.959 --> 08:18.750
Huh? What's this
two-piece whore got on me?

08:18.834 --> 08:20.709
Listen, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.583
Damn straight there is,
sweetheart.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.917
You're messing
with private property.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.917
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.250
Come closer.
I'll be clearer.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.625
Listen, Margot,
you need to stop.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.166
'You're making
a fool of yourself.'

08:32.250 --> 08:35.083
How can you do this?
We have something, Spencer.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.333
It's over, and you..

08:38.417 --> 08:40.417
Let go of me this instant
or I'll..

08:40.500 --> 08:43.291
What?
What, you'll get me fired?

08:43.375 --> 08:46.750
You've got far more
than a job to lose.

08:46.834 --> 08:50.417
You push me, Margot,
I'll push back.

08:56.375 --> 08:59.917
Needless to say, the pool boy
was gone after that incident.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.583
But Margot disappeared, too.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.125
I-I always assumed she went

09:03.208 --> 09:04.667
to Aspen, the Hamptons.

09:04.750 --> 09:09.000
What about Spencer's
hot squeeze, Melissa?

09:09.083 --> 09:10.041
She still around?

09:10.125 --> 09:12.208
Mel? Mel's a fixture.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.959
Her husband
practically owns the
club.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.959
Did her mouth last year.

09:17.041 --> 09:18.500
Frown lines.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.667
This won't take long, will
it?
Tee time's in 15.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.542
It's about Spencer Mason.

09:30.625 --> 09:33.542
Young guy worked here
about 18 years ago, cabana boy.

09:33.625 --> 09:34.959
Can't pin him down.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.166
He might be involved in the
shooting of a Margot Chambers.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.333
You knew her.

09:38.417 --> 09:40.542
Yes, but I have
no memory of him.

09:40.625 --> 09:41.750
(Rush)
'Well, that's kind of funny
'cause we did'

09:41.834 --> 09:43.333
a little background on you.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.750
Pulled credit card
records from 1989.

09:45.834 --> 09:49.542
There's a lot of charges,
Marriot, Ritz, Hilton..

09:49.625 --> 09:51.834
Those are hotels, right?

09:51.917 --> 09:54.208
Spencer and I were involved.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.375
A tryst with the pool boy.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.667
More than a tryst.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.166
He was my ticket
away from this
place.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.166
Talk about
Margot and Spencer.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.166
He said that dragon
lady
had him by the throat.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.792
She was blackmailing him
to continue seeing her.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.000
How'd she manage that?

10:09.083 --> 10:10.125
Said if he didn't keep her happy

10:10.208 --> 10:11.834
she'd accuse him of rape.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.000
Turn him in to the cops.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.625
Well, hell hath no fury.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.834
Spencer needed to get away.

10:17.917 --> 10:21.375
He was in trouble.
I was gonna save
him.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.667
Spencer?

10:36.959 --> 10:38.959
- Spencer?
- Shh.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.792
- Were you followed?
- No.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.083
Margot's been watching
my every move.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.375
Are you sure
you weren't followed?

10:43.458 --> 10:44.959
I was careful.

10:50.792 --> 10:51.875
Did you bring the money?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.208
The dream's almost ours.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.125
You and me,
white, Jamaican sands.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.834
We're gonna be so happy.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.542
She's here. I thought
you said you were careful.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.667
I was. I..
What do we do?

11:12.750 --> 11:14.417
I'll take the car,
lose her on the expressway.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.083
- Come back for you.
- What'll I do without you?

11:16.166 --> 11:19.083
Baby, there's no telling what
she might do if she sees you.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.625
Hide here.
I'll come back for you.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.417
(Spencer)
'Hold onto this.'

11:30.041 --> 11:33.667
And be careful.
That's my heart.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.417
I hid in that place for hours.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.792
He took my car, $50,000 cash.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.750
Played me like the fool I was.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.291
Ever report it?

11:52.375 --> 11:55.166
Told my husband
I had a gambling
problem.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.875
Went into therapy
for a few months.

11:57.959 --> 12:00.250
Moved on with my life.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.291
Now, if there
isn't
anything else..

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
No. You can go.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.792
This guy's a pro.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.000
Plays two rich broads
off against each other

12:12.083 --> 12:13.500
comes out clean.

12:13.583 --> 12:14.834
Not so clean

12:14.917 --> 12:17.625
if Margot caught up
with him a few weeks later.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.000
They mix it up.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.333
And he took more than her money.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.750
You turned me in
to IAD, didn't you?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.333
Your charm never ceases
to amaze.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.333
Not even denying it?
Unbelievable.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.834
'I got asked a question.'

12:38.917 --> 12:40.834
Answered honestly.
Try it sometime.

12:40.917 --> 12:43.875
Where I come from, we got an
issue with someone we tell
'em.

12:43.959 --> 12:47.000
Where I come from
we don't tolerate screw-ups.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.208
No, what's your problem?

12:48.291 --> 12:50.917
I could ask you the same thing.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.250
You're pissed
I never made a move?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.709
Come on, Scotty.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.792
Figured you were smarter
than that.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.625
Oh, yeah, you got me
all figured out, huh?

12:59.709 --> 13:03.750
You are nothing
if not
predictable.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.875
See that comin'?

13:09.959 --> 13:11.166
Go ahead.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.667
Destroy everything.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.000
It's what you're good at.

13:14.083 --> 13:17.500
You got no idea
what I'm capable of.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.083
Is that right?

13:32.959 --> 13:34.250
Got a hit off the photo

13:34.333 --> 13:36.709
we're circulating
on Margot Chambers, boss.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.542
- Someone step forward?
- Well, you could say that.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.333
Margot Chambers is also..

13:42.417 --> 13:44.917
'...Margot Chandler..'

13:45.000 --> 13:46.625
'...Margot Keller..'

13:48.458 --> 13:49.917
Margot Kentworth.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.875
Each name comes with
its own Social Security number

13:51.959 --> 13:54.625
birth certificate
and criminal record.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.792
She has outstanding
warrants
in four states.

13:56.875 --> 14:00.583
Fraud,
check-kiting,
grand theft.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.625
Margot's no rich victim.
She's a con artist.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.333
Just like Spencer.

14:06.417 --> 14:07.750
In fact..

14:07.834 --> 14:09.875
...they were a team.

14:12.667 --> 14:13.917
Hmm.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.917
(Rush)
Well, Margot and Spencer
had quite the partnership.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.083
(Miller)
They spent years
crisscrossing the country

14:27.166 --> 14:28.917
runnin' their various scams.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.083
(Vera)
The flop,
the flat joint

14:31.166 --> 14:33.333
the sawbuck switch.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.417
(Miller)
You got some kind of secret
past we don't know about, Nick?

14:36.500 --> 14:40.166
- Just his old Uncle Vernon.
- He knew some things.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.083
Yeah,
unfortunately
all the wrong
things.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.959
(Rush)
'Well, by the time Margot
and Spencer ended up back East'

14:46.041 --> 14:48.750
they had their country club
scam
going strong.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.792
Spencer roped in
the lonely rich
girls

14:50.875 --> 14:51.959
Margot scared them.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.083
And they walked away
with a pile of cash.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.750
So what got between them?

14:55.834 --> 14:58.542
Maybe Spencer got tired
of doing all the heavy
liftin'.

14:58.625 --> 14:59.959
Must've been exhausting pulling

15:00.041 --> 15:02.542
the knock-and-tickle
on all those trophy wives.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.792
Or she was jealous.
Older woman, younger man.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.333
Afraid she couldn't keep
his interest.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.709
So how do we find a guy
who changes his name

15:08.792 --> 15:09.917
more often than his underwear?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.125
Figure he's the one who slipped

15:11.208 --> 15:12.959
in and out of
Margot's
hospital.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.458
Left gifts
every month for 18
years.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.125
That's some
guilty conscience.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.834
Like maybe he'd wanna pay
his last respects at her
grave.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.250
(Kat)
'So we plant an obit.'

15:23.333 --> 15:25.458
"Margot Chambers,
blah, blah, blah

15:25.542 --> 15:27.375
being buried
at Oak Pines
Cemetery."

15:27.458 --> 15:28.500
Stake it out.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.333
- No, not me. Got court.
- When?

15:32.834 --> 15:35.000
Whenever the stakeout is.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.333
"Plant an obit," she says.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.834
"Stake it out."

15:48.917 --> 15:50.667
Yeah.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.750
Day and a half of my
life
I'm not getting back.

15:53.834 --> 15:57.166
'Cause I'm so stimulated
sitting next to you?

16:01.083 --> 16:04.667
What in the hell
is the sawbuck switch?

16:04.750 --> 16:06.875
Uh, you got a $20 bill?

16:09.125 --> 16:11.250
You wanna see
the trick or
not?

16:18.125 --> 16:20.166
So I go into a busy tavern

16:20.250 --> 16:22.875
and I order a beer
waving this 20.

16:22.959 --> 16:27.375
You pour my suds
and give me change for the
20..

16:27.458 --> 16:29.875
...instead of the ten
I actually gave you.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.125
Got a car comin'.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.041
Spencer Mason?

17:00.125 --> 17:01.625
He's rabbiting!

17:32.458 --> 17:34.166
It's tough.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.959
Losing someone close.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.709
I'm certain
wherever she
is

17:41.792 --> 17:44.250
she's glad you came.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.959
Don't be too sure.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.208
My husband.

17:50.291 --> 17:53.208
Sometimes I feel responsible.

17:53.291 --> 17:54.291
You know?

17:54.375 --> 17:57.208
You like older men, detective?

17:57.291 --> 18:01.083
'Cause your husband
died in 1942.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.792
Nice trick with the decoy.

18:06.875 --> 18:10.458
Well, if I knew they'd send
a cop looks like you, I..

18:10.542 --> 18:12.625
...I wouldn't have bothered.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.542
Gonna make this
hard on us,
Spencer?

18:19.625 --> 18:21.709
Wouldn't dream of it.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.709
You've been lucky
a long time, Spencer.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.834
Eighteen years,
not one arrest.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.834
Yeah, well, it's not luck
that's kept me out of
trouble.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.458
I'm out of the game.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.959
Just like any working man.

18:38.041 --> 18:39.500
Fake Social.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.333
Half a dozen aliases.

18:41.417 --> 18:42.875
Which name's real?

18:44.792 --> 18:46.208
You gonna turn me
in to the Feds?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.667
We're not interested
in your scams, Spencer.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.333
We're murder police.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.083
You think I shot Margot.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.750
I've been in
and out of that hospital

18:55.834 --> 18:57.208
a thousand times.

18:57.291 --> 19:00.333
If I wanted Margot dead,
I could've done it easy.

19:00.417 --> 19:04.166
FBI's just
a phone call away, Spencer.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.417
'They'd be real excited
to meet you.'

19:08.500 --> 19:10.709
Alright, wait.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.166
After we took
the redhead in Cherry
Hill

19:13.250 --> 19:15.417
I wanted out.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.291
I was sick of the game.

19:17.375 --> 19:20.291
But then we got
to Philly and..

19:20.375 --> 19:22.208
...it started again.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.625
Got a dream.

19:26.709 --> 19:29.542
Little white shack in Jamaica.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.458
Right on the beach.

19:31.542 --> 19:33.250
It's not much

19:33.333 --> 19:36.417
but I'd kill or die
to have you there.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.917
You're overselling.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.583
Too specific in the
beginning,
too grand at the end.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.250
You want to entice the girl.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.542
What the hell
are you looking
at?

19:46.750 --> 19:49.125
You know
why you like
her?

19:49.208 --> 19:51.083
She looks like me.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.083
Trailer park version, anyway.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.125
I'm sick of this.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.583
The same bit, the same girl

19:55.667 --> 19:57.750
the same crappy motel.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.625
I'm tired.

20:00.709 --> 20:03.041
You tired of this, too?

20:04.417 --> 20:05.834
(male #2)
'Margie, I know you're
there!'

20:05.917 --> 20:07.250
Who is it, the cops?

20:07.333 --> 20:09.000
[whispering]
Just get in the bathroom now.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.875
(male #2)
'Open this damn door now!'

20:16.542 --> 20:18.542
- Where is he?
- It's been a while, Lenny.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.125
What brings you
to the big city?

20:20.208 --> 20:21.625
I know that little turd's
here somewhere.

20:21.709 --> 20:24.417
Don't take another step.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.834
You gonna do me
like you did Hank?

20:25.917 --> 20:27.917
I didn't put that gun
in your brother's mouth.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.291
Might as well have, Margie.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.542
It's Margot now.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.208
You took every penny Hank had.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.625
You took his pride.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.250
He had fun while it lasted.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.959
He was my baby brother, Margie.

20:38.041 --> 20:40.417
I told you it's Margot.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.166
Now get the hell
out of my room.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.625
You made a mistake.

20:46.709 --> 20:49.125
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

20:49.208 --> 20:52.333
'Cause I sure as hell
am going to make you pay.

21:03.291 --> 21:06.291
It was the first time
I saw what we did to people.

21:06.375 --> 21:09.125
After

21:09.208 --> 21:10.917
'I got out after that.'

21:11.000 --> 21:13.166
I took my split
from Cherry Hill

21:13.250 --> 21:15.375
went to Florida the next day.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.667
And Margot?

21:16.750 --> 21:20.500
Well, when I left,
she was running scared.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.792
Was plannin' a quick exit.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.375
Not quick enough.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.500
You buyin' this line?

21:29.583 --> 21:30.709
Story holds.

21:30.792 --> 21:32.792
Henry Delpy out of Blossburg, PA

21:32.875 --> 21:34.917
reported a Margie Kentworth

21:35.000 --> 21:36.417
taking everything he owned

21:36.500 --> 21:37.917
back in the mid '70s.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.875
Guy ended up eatin' his gun.

21:39.959 --> 21:43.375
Brother Lenny goes after
her
thinking eye for an eye?

21:43.458 --> 21:45.083
Mm.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.709
Check him out.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.583
What about
Prince Charming?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.542
Cut him loose.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.250
But put a plainclothes unit
on him, see what he does.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.333
Margie finally
got in over her head.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.792
(Jeffries)
'You mean, Margot.'

22:09.875 --> 22:12.542
Well, she could've called
herself the Queen of Sheba.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.542
It wasn't gonna change
who she was.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.750
Trailer park trash
like all of us.

22:16.834 --> 22:18.542
Are you saying
she came from here?

22:18.625 --> 22:20.834
Oh, yeah. Two rows back
as a matter of fact.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.458
Though by the age of ten, you
could see she meant to get
out.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.750
- Ambitious.
- Motivated.

22:25.834 --> 22:28.417
Mom beat the crap
out of her daily.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.542
Yeah, Margie would watch
the old movies to escape.

22:30.625 --> 22:33.667
What was the one? Audrey
Hepburn
and Humphrey Bogart.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.750
Uh..."Sabrina," yeah.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.000
Poor girl makes good.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.250
Like Margot.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.750
Yeah, Margie
watched it over and over.

22:40.834 --> 22:43.750
Started believing she deserved
more than a welfare husband

22:43.834 --> 22:45.166
or canned chili dinner.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.375
(Vera)
'Sad story.'

22:46.458 --> 22:48.125
Oh, no.
She got what she deserved.

22:48.208 --> 22:49.792
(Jeffries)
'Well, not the attitude
I'd be going for'

22:49.875 --> 22:52.291
if I was trying
to look
innocent.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.250
I-I wasn't out to kill her.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.542
I was gonna turn her
in to the cops.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.542
Uh-huh.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.792
This old hick from the boonies

22:57.875 --> 23:00.083
had a few tricks
up his own sleeve.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.500
Planted a bug in her room.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.291
Lenny, you're a man
after my own heart.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.625
What's that?

23:22.709 --> 23:26.125
You've never had
Pop Rocks before?

23:26.208 --> 23:27.125
Okay.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.542
Pour some
in your
mouth.

23:34.959 --> 23:37.375
Funny, right?
Now drink some soda.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.375
Where'd you come from?

23:46.458 --> 23:47.792
Nowhere.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.500
Born on the run,
lived that way ever since.

23:50.583 --> 23:53.583
Fifteen states
in eighteen years.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.500
How about you?

23:55.583 --> 23:58.333
Five miles
down the
interstate

23:58.417 --> 24:01.333
where I was born, raised..

24:01.417 --> 24:03.125
...probably where I'll die.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.959
Mmm.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.166
Sounds like paradise.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.959
Um...sorry.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.667
Um, I'll just go.

24:28.875 --> 24:33.834
Leave the towels.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.500
No time to be doing the maid.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.792
I mean, honestly,
what's the angle?

24:37.875 --> 24:40.375
The angle, Margot,
is none of your business.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.041
Everything's my business
right now. We're in trouble.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.917
And while you were servicing
the help

24:45.000 --> 24:47.500
I was working
our exit strategy.

24:48.959 --> 24:51.667
- Life insurance?
- Three million dollars'
worth.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.667
All I got to do is sign over
the beneficiary card to you.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.959
I die.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.875
'We're rich.'

24:57.959 --> 25:01.375
You kind of really need a
body
to make this work.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.709
Insurance companies
won't take your word on
it.

25:04.792 --> 25:07.333
That maid of yours, Kylie

25:07.417 --> 25:10.166
she really does a crap job.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.417
No way.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.875
- She's off limits.
- She looks like me.

25:13.959 --> 25:15.291
'With a little work,
the right clothes'

25:15.375 --> 25:16.750
we could pass as twins.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.291
I've never asked you
for anything

25:19.375 --> 25:21.583
not once,
but I'm asking now.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.083
We don't have the time.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.667
And she already trusts you.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.834
It's perfect.

25:28.917 --> 25:32.208
- I won't do it.
- You don't have a choice.

25:32.291 --> 25:35.917
Your other option is run
for the rest of your life.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.208
'Cause Lenny's just the first.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.250
There's more out there,
guaranteed.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.959
'We've reached
the end of the line, baby.'

25:42.041 --> 25:46.625
But with this,
not only do we disappear

25:46.709 --> 25:48.750
we do it rich.

25:50.834 --> 25:54.792
Then you can buy
any kind of normal you want.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.208
So by the time I got the tape
to anyone who'd listen

26:01.291 --> 26:02.875
Margie and the kid
had disappeared.

26:02.959 --> 26:05.792
And I mean vanished
off the face of this earth.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.834
So Margot was
gonna fake her own
death

26:07.917 --> 26:09.834
using the boyfriend's new girl?

26:09.917 --> 26:11.333
Boyfriend?

26:11.417 --> 26:13.291
Is that what you guys think?

26:13.375 --> 26:15.875
Spencer wasn't
Margie's boyfriend.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.000
He was her son.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.750
Mm. Heard about mother issues
before, but this is messed up.

26:29.834 --> 26:31.333
Must've had the kid
when she was 14.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.291
Put him to work
before he could talk.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.500
Conspiracy, fraud, murder.

26:35.583 --> 26:38.041
Hallmarks
of any mother-son
relationship.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.875
I got it.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.917
I found the insurance policy.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.417
"Three million dollars,
taken out on Margot McKinney.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.333
Payable to...Linus Larrabee."

26:47.417 --> 26:49.125
Expired three years ago.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.959
Woman takes a bullet
to the skull, manages to hold
on

26:52.041 --> 26:54.041
three years
after her insurance expires.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.792
What I call resolve.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.834
Now, who's Linus Larrabee?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.750
Figure Spencer
can shed some light.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.959
'Cause he's been
so forthright up to now?

27:02.041 --> 27:04.667
Doesn't matter. Spencer ducked
his tail an hour ago.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.709
'Lost in a crowd of tourists
by Independence Park.'

27:07.792 --> 27:09.750
(Valens)
'That slick son of a bitch.'

27:09.834 --> 27:11.041
On the other hand,
we've got a lead

27:11.125 --> 27:13.375
on Kylie Kramer,
the motel maid.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.667
- Not dead?
- Very much alive.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.250
She's got a history, too.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.458
Juvenile record.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.125
Ah, so it's sealed.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.583
Not anymore.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.041
Kylie's father went down
for rape when she was nine.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.333
'Put her in bad
with men from the start.'

27:27.917 --> 27:29.166
This girl's no joke.

27:29.250 --> 27:31.250
[clears throat]
Stalking charges, battery.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.333
Agg assault?

27:32.417 --> 27:34.166
Knifed a guy
who was two-timing her.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.834
Maybe Kylie gets wind of
Margot's plan to do her in..

27:37.917 --> 27:40.333
Does Margot first.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.709
Spencer was good, you know?

27:49.792 --> 27:52.125
Better than them
other slugs out there.

27:52.208 --> 27:53.709
Kinda guy
you wanna hang on to, huh?

27:53.792 --> 27:57.125
Believe me, girl, I tried,
with everything I got.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.750
Mother issues, right?

28:00.834 --> 28:02.875
Same story, different book.

28:02.959 --> 28:04.375
If it's not a wife

28:04.458 --> 28:05.625
'it's a mom.'

28:05.709 --> 28:08.125
Margot was a bitch on wheels.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.917
Bitch that deserved to die?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.125
That's not me sayin' it.

28:12.208 --> 28:14.750
I heard you were handy
with a blade.

28:14.834 --> 28:16.500
Push comes to shove.

28:16.583 --> 28:20.000
Troubled youth is
what they call it.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.583
But that's the past.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.250
(Miller)
'Like to believe you,
Kylie.'

28:23.333 --> 28:24.792
The only problem is

28:24.875 --> 28:27.041
Margot was looking
to take you out of the
picture.

28:27.125 --> 28:30.583
(Rush)
'You still being here,
and her being dead..'

28:30.667 --> 28:33.000
...brings up questions.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.250
Well, maybe
I have some answers.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.959
I told you, Margot.
I don't want it.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.750
Of course, you
do.
It's Godiva.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.625
- It's got sauce inside.
- Not sauce, cherry cordial.

28:49.709 --> 28:51.583
It's not
a thousand-dollar
napkin.

28:51.667 --> 28:52.875
Margot, she's an adult.

28:52.959 --> 28:56.000
Well, all evidence
to the contrary.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.750
Let's see if we've made
any improvement.

29:01.834 --> 29:04.208
What the hell is this?

29:05.041 --> 29:06.875
I think you look great.

29:06.959 --> 29:09.792
I look like you.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.834
But that's what
Spencer likes,
dear.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.500
No. I liked her
the way she was.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.875
Oh, don't frown, Kylie.

29:17.959 --> 29:21.875
Show off those pearly whites
we fixed for you.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.625
The bill's paid.

29:23.709 --> 29:24.667
By whom?

29:24.750 --> 29:25.834
A red-headed woman.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.625
She left this,
said it belongs to him.

29:31.542 --> 29:33.208
How did she find us?

29:33.291 --> 29:34.375
We've got to complete
this tonight.

29:34.458 --> 29:35.375
We can't.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.834
We don't got a choice, Spencer.

29:37.917 --> 29:39.500
Complete what?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.667
Should've seen
the looks on their
faces.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.166
Like they just
got goosed or
somethin'.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.625
What happened after that?

29:50.709 --> 29:53.208
I go to Spencer's room
that night and he is
gone.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.375
I mean, not a trace.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.667
Margot, too.

29:56.750 --> 30:00.000
Along with my last
chance
at something real.

30:00.083 --> 30:03.000
Take it from me, girl,
you dodged a bullet.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.959
- Rush.
- 'Your boss made a mistake.'

30:08.041 --> 30:10.583
(Spencer)
'Should've put you on my
tail.'

30:10.667 --> 30:11.917
Where are you, Spencer?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.583
'Haven't guessed
my real name yet?'

30:14.667 --> 30:16.208
I'm not playing games.

30:16.291 --> 30:19.166
'Go to the beginning,
figure it out.'

30:19.250 --> 30:21.750
'When you do, I'll be waiting.'

30:24.041 --> 30:25.458
(Stillman)
'You lied to us, Melissa.'

30:25.542 --> 30:27.542
You weren't over Spencer,
far from it.

30:27.625 --> 30:31.208
You were followin' him.
Looking to settle the score.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.959
That's not true.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.583
A witness places you
at a Philadelphia hair salon

30:37.667 --> 30:40.041
with Margot
same day she took a bullet.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.375
(Valens)
'Got a registered
9 millimeter Beretta.'

30:42.458 --> 30:45.208
- Belongs to your husband.
- 'They took from you,
Melissa.'

30:45.291 --> 30:47.917
Played you like a cheap piano.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.875
Nearly destroyed my marriage.

30:49.959 --> 30:51.458
I don't doubt it.

30:51.542 --> 30:53.750
Trying to explain away
all that cash.

30:53.834 --> 30:55.083
It wasn't the money.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.750
It was the humiliation.

30:57.834 --> 31:00.291
They were laughing at me.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.417
You couldn't let that stand.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.583
I tracked him down.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.583
Took weeks.

31:10.667 --> 31:13.291
Calling every damn country
club
in New Jersey

31:13.375 --> 31:15.333
New York, Pennsylvania.

31:15.417 --> 31:18.500
And that's when
you decided to kill them.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.875
I watched them at the motel.

31:22.542 --> 31:25.291
Waited for dark.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.291
For my moment.

31:28.375 --> 31:31.250
<i>I saw a woman going</i>
<i>into Spencer's room.</i>

31:31.333 --> 31:33.625
<i>At first,</i>
<i>I thought it was Margot</i>

31:33.709 --> 31:36.166
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

31:56.834 --> 31:59.166
<i>Margot was in the next room.</i>

31:59.250 --> 32:02.333
<i>Then everything</i>
<i>just got crazy.</i>

32:06.917 --> 32:09.583
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.542
I don't know
what the hell happened

33:10.625 --> 33:13.208
and I don't want to know.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.208
I left.

33:15.291 --> 33:18.166
Tried to forget
I was ever there.

33:29.834 --> 33:32.583
So Kylie and Spencer
double-crossed Margot.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.500
They fake her
murder,
make it look real.

33:35.583 --> 33:36.917
Why?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.083
Well, they needed her to
sign
the beneficiary card

33:39.166 --> 33:41.667
on the insurance.

33:41.750 --> 33:45.000
That means Margot
the master grifter

33:45.083 --> 33:47.709
got beat
at her own game.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.542
I did what you said.

34:09.625 --> 34:12.166
I went to the beginning.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.917
Blossburg.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.208
Not much consensus on Margot,
except everyone remembers

34:19.291 --> 34:22.375
she loved those old movies..

34:22.458 --> 34:24.458
...especially "Sabrina."

34:24.542 --> 34:27.875
Yeah, must have seen it
a thousand times.

34:27.959 --> 34:30.000
It's a good one.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.834
What was Humphrey Bogart's
name in it again?

34:33.917 --> 34:36.625
Uh..

34:36.709 --> 34:38.166
...Linus..

34:38.250 --> 34:39.250
...Larrabee.

34:40.750 --> 34:44.083
Linus Larrabee.

34:44.166 --> 34:47.917
The same name's
on the hotel
registry.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.667
Also the beneficiary
on Margot's insurance
policy.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.834
Your birth name, right?

34:56.250 --> 34:59.417
Yeah, Margot
thought it sounded fancy.

35:01.166 --> 35:05.083
It didn't do me any favors
on the playground.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.792
I know
what it's
like.

35:07.875 --> 35:10.250
Having a difficult mother.

35:10.333 --> 35:13.000
'Took you out
on the road early, huh?'

35:13.083 --> 35:15.125
Put me to work at six.

35:15.208 --> 35:18.917
Well, that kind of life..

35:19.000 --> 35:21.333
...anyone could understand
your anger.

35:22.917 --> 35:26.458
Playing the sympathy card.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.083
Is that your game, Lilly?

35:28.166 --> 35:30.542
You wanted me
to find you
here.

35:30.625 --> 35:31.875
Why?

35:34.291 --> 35:36.583
I'd never hurt Margot.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.000
I took care of her
all those years.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.583
Because she was your mother.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.667
Plus she was
the only one who knew me.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.625
I mean, no one..

35:45.709 --> 35:50.291
...will ever love me
the way she did.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.458
Then why'd you kill her?

35:54.834 --> 35:57.709
'Now, you're a con man.'

35:57.792 --> 36:00.417
'Probably lie
with your last breath.'

36:02.333 --> 36:05.917
But I need you to be honest.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.667
Not for me.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.834
For Margot.

36:13.291 --> 36:14.834
'For your mother.'

36:16.333 --> 36:18.583
I just wanted to be normal.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.125
Stand up, baby. You're gonna
get blood everywhere.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.166
Come on. Move.

36:39.583 --> 36:42.208
[sighs]
Gotta go now, baby.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.709
Everything's
gonna be okay.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.792
I'll make sure of it.

37:13.875 --> 37:17.458
You have to sign the
beneficiary
card over to me.

37:17.542 --> 37:20.542
You earned it tonight, kid.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.667
Guess I did.

37:26.750 --> 37:29.750
We'll dump the body,
get rid of the car.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.291
I got the bus tickets, too.

37:41.625 --> 37:42.875
Blanks?

37:47.458 --> 37:50.291
I didn't think
you had it in you.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.667
Honestly, I didn't see it
coming at all.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.875
Work of art, darling.

37:54.959 --> 37:57.291
And who knew you had a brain.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.458
Spencer,
do it already.

38:01.208 --> 38:02.875
Put the gun down, Linus.

38:02.959 --> 38:04.166
'She's not worth it.'

38:04.250 --> 38:05.709
(Spencer)
'Shut up, Margot.'

38:05.792 --> 38:07.875
I did it all for you..

38:07.959 --> 38:09.875
...because I love you.

38:09.959 --> 38:12.000
'You're the only one
who matters.'

38:12.083 --> 38:13.834
Don't listen to her, Spencer.

38:13.917 --> 38:17.834
The day you were born, I swore
you'd have a better life.

38:17.917 --> 38:20.709
'You're my only reason
to live, Linus.'

38:21.750 --> 38:23.333
You're my son.

38:25.959 --> 38:29.875
- I can't.
- And I'm your mother.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.542
You're a monster!

38:33.917 --> 38:35.166
Mama?

38:38.875 --> 38:40.125
'Mama?'

38:41.291 --> 38:42.959
Just say something.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.542
Please.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.667
Sorry, mama.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.125
I'm so sorry.

38:59.458 --> 39:03.917
I wanted so bad
to have my own life

39:04.000 --> 39:06.125
to be free of her.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.583
Now after
all these years..

39:10.417 --> 39:11.959
...you are.

39:13.875 --> 39:17.417
And I'm so..

39:17.500 --> 39:20.000
...lost without her.

39:28.208 --> 39:30.583
It was his idea..

39:30.667 --> 39:32.333
...the whole thing.

39:32.417 --> 39:35.625
'Take her down
and get the money.'

39:35.709 --> 39:38.375
But I never had a chance
with that woman in his life.

39:38.458 --> 39:42.625
He was what she made him.
She was his mother.

39:42.709 --> 39:45.917
[sobbing]
We were supposed
to be free after her.

39:49.208 --> 39:52.667
But Spencer just sat there,
starin' at her.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.166
So you did everything.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.875
Cleaned the room,
dumped the body, the car.

40:02.125 --> 40:04.583
All he had to do
was come and get me.

40:06.291 --> 40:08.083
He never showed.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.291
Three days I waited..

40:15.709 --> 40:18.583
...and then I heard
the news on the
radio.

40:22.166 --> 40:24.291
That bitch
was still
alive.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.583
(Kylie)
'I've been waiting.'

40:41.291 --> 40:42.959
Where were you?

40:49.709 --> 40:51.291
Spencer.

40:51.375 --> 40:54.166
It's time to go
before somebody sees us here.

40:58.417 --> 41:01.625
I did this for you, you know?

41:01.709 --> 41:04.417
For our dreams.
Remember?

41:06.667 --> 41:10.750
[sobbing]
'We're free now.
We can go anywhere we want.'

41:13.625 --> 41:16.500
Please don't make me go alone.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.000
I can't leave her.

41:21.709 --> 41:23.583
She's my mother.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.333
