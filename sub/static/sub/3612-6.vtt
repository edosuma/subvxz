00:02.003 --> 00:03.743
Previously on Lost:

00:08.676 --> 00:09.665
These are our names.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.716
- Where's Jacob?
- I don't know.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.465
Why is my name written on this?

00:13.556 --> 00:15.217
- He didn't tell me.
- What does he want?

00:15.308 --> 00:18.675
I had to get you and Jack as far away
from that Temple as I possibly could.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.469
- What? Why?
- 'Cause someone's coming there.

00:23.316 --> 00:24.305
Someone bad.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.279
- There's still time.
- Not for me.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.269
Where's Jarrah?

01:09.028 --> 01:11.269
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Where is he?

01:11.364 --> 01:14.731
Considering he just killed Dogen,
I don't think he's gonna be joining us.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.736
- Who's Dogen?
- Guy in charge of the Temple.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.204
- Sayid killed the interpreter, too.
- You sure?

01:19.288 --> 01:22.325
He was standing over their dead bodies
holding a bloody dagger. I'm sure.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.123
- You said we were safe at the Temple.
- That's what I was told.

01:25.211 --> 01:27.042
- What about the beach?
- What beach?

01:27.129 --> 01:30.087
Where we buried Locke. Where they lived.
We'll have the water at our backs,

01:30.174 --> 01:33.666
and it's familiar territory.
Anybody else got a better idea?

01:34.345 --> 01:35.926
No. The beach it is.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.514
- That way.
- Move.

01:40.518 --> 01:43.931
And it was on this island
that everything changed.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.730
That everything finally became clear.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.932
Elba...

01:49.735 --> 01:52.943
...is where Napoleon
faced his greatest test.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.897
Because exile wasn't
the worst of his fate.

01:55.992 --> 01:59.905
What was truly devastating to him
was the loss of his power.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.863
Sure, they allowed him
to keep the title of Emperor,

02:03.499 --> 02:05.660
but without any power,
it was meaningless.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.707
He mightjust as well have been dead.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.789
All right. Remember,
five and six tomorrow. Thank you.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.217
Principal Reynolds. Good morning.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.212
Walk with me.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.465
Linus, there's been a schedule shift.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.223
I need you to supervise detention
after school today.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.804
- What?
- In fact, all week.

02:27.898 --> 02:31.265
Cutbacks, budget crises,
events above your pay grade.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.897
Needless to say,
some of us have to pull double duty.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.774
We have History Club.
Those kids need me.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.607
There are five students
in History Club. They'll live.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.942
Shouldn't we be encouraging
the ones with ambition?

02:41.037 --> 02:43.995
The club isn't for them, it's for you.
Makes you feel needed.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.414
Unfortunately, for now,
you're needed... in detention.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.583
Thanks for your understanding, Linus.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.247
lt's Dr. Linus, actually.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.427
For the love of...
It's ruined! lt's ruined.

03:01.432 --> 03:04.765
- What's the problem, Leslie?
- Formaldehyde.

03:04.852 --> 03:08.015
Formaldehyde's the problem.
Know what gets out formaldehyde?

03:08.105 --> 03:10.892
Nothing. Maybe ifl had
some freaking lab aprons,

03:10.983 --> 03:14.601
I wouldn't pay for incompetent students
with another trip to Marshalls.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.196
Budget cutbacks.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.488
How hard would it be for Reynolds to
spread a little love to the sciences?

03:19.575 --> 03:22.066
l'm dealing with
lab equipment from the 1950s.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.196
Now, why is that?

03:23.829 --> 03:27.196
Principal Reynolds is an administrator.
He's not a teacher.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.624
He's forgotten what
the public school system is about.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.124
Summers off in exchange for a crap
pension. I'm happy to remind him.

03:34.465 --> 03:37.707
Taking care of the kids.
That's what's important.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.542
OK. You just keep dreaming.

03:39.637 --> 03:43.129
Well, I know you've given up,
but I refuse to.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.673
Maybe you should be the principal.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.353
So says the substitute.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.272
What do you mean,
I should be the principal?

03:54.360 --> 03:56.396
Sounds like you care about this place.

03:56.904 --> 04:01.238
And if the man in charge doesn't,
then maybe it's time for a change.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.067
I appreciate the sentiment,
but who's gonna listen?

04:08.332 --> 04:09.492
I'm listening.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.012
Tell me what that thing back there was.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.261
That thing killed her friends
at the statue.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.512
And Jacob, right?

04:30.813 --> 04:32.053
lt killed Jacob, too.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.314
- Yeah, of course. And Jacob.
- Of course.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.940
You're Miles, right? Miles Straume?

04:40.406 --> 04:41.942
You communicate with the dead.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.988
Not technically. l...
I can tell you how someone died,

04:46.078 --> 04:48.785
pick up their last thoughts
before they check out...

04:48.873 --> 04:53.037
- I need to be near their bodies.
- This is what's left of Jacob's body.

04:56.464 --> 04:59.797
So tell me, Miles, how did he die?

05:34.877 --> 05:37.493
- Linus killed him.
- What?

05:37.922 --> 05:39.412
That's not true.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.294
Are you sure?

05:44.053 --> 05:47.170
He was standing over Jacob's
dead body with a bloody dagger,

05:47.264 --> 05:49.926
so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.566
Thank you.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.442
Jacob was the closest thing
I ever had to a father.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.169
I'm gonna look for some tools
and get to work on some shelter.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.594
The rest of you see what food's left.
Maybe get a fire going.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.801
Yeah, a fire will fix everything.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.812
There anything you'd like me to do?

07:33.871 --> 07:37.204
You know, psychics, totally unreliable.

07:38.375 --> 07:42.038
Miles actually tried to
blackmail me once into...

07:46.091 --> 07:48.047
You make friends easy, don't you?

08:10.282 --> 08:13.615
I made you one of the turkey meals
with the cranberry sauce you like.

08:14.078 --> 08:17.036
It ain't one of them lean deals, is it?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.499
No, Dad. lt's organic.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.333
- I'm trying to keep you healthy.
- It's a little late for that.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.245
How was work?

08:26.965 --> 08:29.832
l have a doctorate
in Modern European History...

08:32.513 --> 08:35.300
...and yet I'm babysitting
burnouts in detention.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.765
Detention, huh?

08:40.104 --> 08:41.640
And, the worst of it is,

08:41.730 --> 08:47.020
as I look out at those ingrates
that I'm tasked with watching...

08:49.530 --> 08:51.395
...I can't help thinking...

08:56.704 --> 08:59.491
...that, maybe, I'm more
a loser than any of them.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.911
This isn't the life
I wanted for you, Ben.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.293
- I wanted so much more.
- I know.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.751
That's why I signed up
for that damn Dharma lnitiative

09:13.846 --> 09:15.757
and took you to the island, and...

09:16.306 --> 09:18.297
They were decent people.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.057
Smarter than I'll ever be.

09:22.438 --> 09:26.898
Imagine how different our lives
would have been if we'd stayed.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.100
We'd have both lived happily ever after.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.775
No, I'm serious, Ben.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.737
Who knows what you would've become?

09:39.997 --> 09:42.704
- Now, does that feel better?
- Yes.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.498
Thank you.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.831
- Alex?
- Dr. Linus.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.501
Where were you today?
We had to cancel History Club.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.505
I'm so sorry. I should've
put a note on the door.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.433
The meetings have to be postponed.
I'm in detention all week.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.851
Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.685
Principal Reynolds
needs me to cover, so...

10:09.359 --> 10:10.735
AP test is Friday.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.686
l was kind of counting on the tutoring.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.650
All right. How about this?

10:19.745 --> 10:23.363
Tomorrow morning, seven am, in the
library. And you bring the coffee.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.535
Thanks.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.204
God, you're the best, Dr. Linus.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.502
- My pleasure, Alex.
- OK.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.504
See you.

10:47.523 --> 10:50.890
Excuse me. How long
are we going to stay here?

10:51.318 --> 10:55.061
- I told you, I don't know yet.
- I need to find my husband.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.533
Trust me, if anyone
wants to find him, it's me.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.528
But I don't know where to look.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.739
Why do you want to find Jin?

11:04.373 --> 11:07.740
Because your last name is Kwon,
so is his.

11:08.710 --> 11:12.248
I don't know whether I'm supposed
to protect you, him, or both of you.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.206
Protect us? What are you talking about?

11:17.511 --> 11:20.969
You're candidates... to replace Jacob.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.348
Replace him? To do what?

11:25.394 --> 11:28.682
If you're the one selected,
I imagine you'll find out.

11:31.275 --> 11:35.939
Wait. You said "candidates."
How many are there?

11:36.947 --> 11:39.905
Six. There are only six left.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.451
- Cheese curds...
- Hurley. Come on. Wake up.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.426
Come on. Let's go.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.509
We'll make the Temple by nightfall.

12:02.139 --> 12:06.803
- I'm hungry. Let's eat breakfast first.
- No, we can eat on the way.

12:07.811 --> 12:08.971
What's the rush?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.807
You know, maybe we should take our time.

12:12.691 --> 12:13.806
Why?

12:14.484 --> 12:15.610
Because.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.477
I'm leaving, Hurley. You coming or not?

12:27.623 --> 12:29.784
Dude, it's this way.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.826
- No, we came this way.
- Yeah, but that was a mistake.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.663
This is faster.
Trust me, it's just around here.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.919
- It's a shortcut.
- No, it's not.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.675
You're both wrong.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.591
Temple's that way.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.592
Where did you come from?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.729
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.649
Not yet. But if you wanna go
to the Temple, it's this way.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.613
Dude, you trust that guy?

13:06.203 --> 13:07.739
At least he's not stalling.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.124
When you're finished in the library,
give me a hand getting firewood.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.959
Just looking for something useful.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.386
The things people
will bring on a trip...

13:33.939 --> 13:35.054
"Oceanic."

13:36.942 --> 13:40.400
I remember that plane
breaking in half like it was yesterday.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.727
You sound nostalgic.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.197
- Maybe I am.
- l was supposed to be flying it.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.451
Oceanic 815.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.993
- And why didn't you?
- l overslept.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.290
Come on.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.414
Can you believe it?
Imagine how different

13:58.505 --> 14:02.748
- my life'd be had that alarm gone off.
- How different would it have been?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.048
The island still got you
in the end, didn't it?

14:12.436 --> 14:13.676
Walk.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.494
- OK, wait. You don't have to be so...
- Stop! On the ground, face down.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.643
What are you doing? Look,
If this is about what Miles said...

15:01.651 --> 15:03.733
- Pick it up.
- What?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.276
Pick it up and start digging.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.949
- Dig what?
- A grave.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.658
- For who?
- You murdered Jacob.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.326
It's for you.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.088
Now, you know this. I know you do.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.087
Expanded Lord Cornwallis' powers
as Governor-General.

15:31.181 --> 15:35.094
Very good. Now, moving on
to the Charter Act of 1813.

15:35.185 --> 15:39.554
At the time of the charter,
the East India Trading Company's power

15:39.648 --> 15:42.685
extended to all of India except for...

15:46.780 --> 15:49.237
- I don't know!
- It's OK. It's just a test.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.609
Just a test?

15:51.993 --> 15:54.279
It's only my entire life, Dr. Linus.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.407
Alex, I think you're a bit overdramatic.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.616
Am I? My mom works two jobs
just to pay our rent.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.621
How am I gonna pay for college?

16:03.421 --> 16:06.629
Let alone Yale.
Assuming I can even get in.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.213
You're one of the brightest students
I've ever had.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.254
I don't worry about your future at all.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.218
- Really?
- Really.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.811
What can I do to help? I'll write you
a great letter of recommendation...

16:20.897 --> 16:22.558
No, I need someone who went there.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.769
Unfortunately, the only one | know's
that pervert, Principal Reynolds.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.312
Excuse me, "pervert?"

16:32.367 --> 16:33.607
Forget I said that.

16:34.578 --> 16:39.288
- l was just angry.
- Alex, has Principal Reynolds...

16:39.374 --> 16:42.241
- ...done something to you?
- What?

16:43.795 --> 16:46.628
- No! I swear, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

16:49.885 --> 16:52.968
Dr. Linus, if I tell you,
will you promise to keep it between us?

16:53.054 --> 16:54.260
Of course I promise.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.928
OK.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.444
So I was in the nurse's office
a few months ago.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.861
I had a stomachache and | just went in
to find a cot, and fell asleep.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.903
When I woke up, after school,
in the other room,

17:15.994 --> 17:19.953
Principal Reynolds was there.
And the nurse, well,

17:20.040 --> 17:22.406
I guess she forgot I was in there.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.666
They were...

17:25.795 --> 17:29.913
...you know, doing it.
In the room right next to me.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.716
Where they give kids hearing tests.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.761
- Isn't that totally gross?
- Totally.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.225
Dr. Linus, you're not gonna
say something, are you?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.974
No, no. A promise is a promise.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.732
Well, shall we return to the high seas?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.945
Yeah. Sure.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.974
Not exactly tearing it up
on the digging front, are you?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.182
I'm not in a big hurry.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.939
Brought you some grub. Hope you like

18:30.026 --> 18:32.403
green beans and banana,
'cause that's all we got.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.065
Not really hungry.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.948
Suit yourself.

18:39.536 --> 18:43.779
Miles. Do you remember once
you asked me for 3.2 million dollars?

18:43.873 --> 18:44.862
Do you still want it?

18:45.542 --> 18:48.909
What are you gonna do? You gonna
write me a check on this banana leaf?

18:49.004 --> 18:51.290
I can get off this island.
And, when I do,

18:51.381 --> 18:55.715
l have a vast network of people and
resources that will get you that money.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.340
- All you have to do is cut me loose.
- Why would I need your money

18:59.431 --> 19:02.298
when there are jabonies
under there named Nikki and Paulo

19:02.392 --> 19:06.055
who got buried alive with eight million
dollars in diamonds on top of them?

19:07.105 --> 19:10.438
I can't believe you're just gonna
stand by and watch this happen.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.350
llana's gonna murder me
for killing Jacob,

19:13.445 --> 19:15.652
a man who didn't even care
about being killed.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.940
- No, he cared.
- Excuse me?

19:20.410 --> 19:23.618
Right up until the second
the knife went through his heart,

19:23.705 --> 19:25.491
he was hoping he was wrong about you.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.537
I guess he wasn't.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.839
Dig!

19:48.855 --> 19:52.188
- So, you're not time traveling?
- No.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.017
But you look the same
as you did 30 years ago.

19:55.111 --> 19:58.023
- How is that possible?
- It's not easy to explain.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.485
Is this like a Terminator thing?
You a cyborg?

20:01.576 --> 20:04.283
- No, I'm not a cyborg.
- Vampire?

20:04.746 --> 20:09.331
- Jacob gave me a gift.
- Jacob. What do you know about him?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.793
I know he's dead.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.588
You said we were going to the Temple.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.219
- I lied.
-Why?

20:27.310 --> 20:29.221
Because everyone at the Temple is dead.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.145
What do you mean they're all dead?

20:36.945 --> 20:37.980
What happened?

20:38.738 --> 20:42.230
I'm not sure what happened,
but I just came from there.

20:43.785 --> 20:48.324
- There's no survivors.
- What about our friends? Sayid, Kate.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.280
No, they weren't there.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.873
Well, maybe they made it out alive.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.413
Whatever you're looking
for at the Temple, it's not there.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.008
You didn't want to go back.
Did you know?

21:02.554 --> 21:04.510
Jacob kind of, sort of, hinted at it.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.843
- You spoke to Jacob?
- Yeah.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.519
Well, whatever he said,
don't believe him.

21:15.692 --> 21:16.852
Where are you going?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.400
- l have something I need to do.
- To do what?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.281
Die.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.743
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Yes, I guess.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.123
Might as well just give them all Fs.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.923
How hard is it to learn the difference
between a genus and a species?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.213
What do you want?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.636
You're good with computers, aren't you?

21:47.974 --> 21:51.558
Something tells me you wouldn't be here
if you didn't already know I was.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.135
Could you, hypothetically,

21:54.230 --> 21:57.188
access someone's e-mail account
without their knowledge?

21:57.275 --> 22:00.767
- Yeah. It depends on the account.
- Say, a faculty account.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.152
Hypothetic.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.439
- Whose?
- Nurse Kondracki.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.116
Kim? Why? You got the hots for her?

22:09.204 --> 22:15.074
No, l'mjust... I'm curious
about some of her correspondence.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.753
With whom?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.838
OK, that's fine.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.668
I didn't come to see you.
You came to see me.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.844
I don't have time
to play 20 Questions.

22:27.931 --> 22:32.391
Either tell me what you're doing, or let
me finish grading my papers in peace.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.933
All right, all right.

22:34.479 --> 22:38.313
l have reason to believe
that she might be engaged

22:38.399 --> 22:42.893
in an inappropriate personal
relationship with Principal Reynolds.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.240
You're making a play.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.986
You're going after the big job,
aren't you?

22:49.077 --> 22:51.784
Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?

22:54.958 --> 22:56.448
I want a good spot.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.617
- I'm sorry?
- I want Lamour's spot

22:59.712 --> 23:00.997
in the main parking lot.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.831
The one next to the maple tree,
not under the maple tree.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.210
That way I get the shade

23:05.301 --> 23:07.678
but not all that tree crap
over the hood of my car.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.590
And I want aprons.
I want lots of aprons.

23:10.682 --> 23:14.174
And I want lab equipment in here
that was built in this decade. Deal?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.555
Deal.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.893
You know, you really had me fooled
with that sweater vest.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.976
Linus, you're a real killer.

24:20.877 --> 24:21.866
Been here before?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.376
Yes.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.795
And in all the time
that I've spent on this island,

24:29.886 --> 24:32.172
today is the first time
I've ever come back.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.717
Jack?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.843
- Dude, where are you?
- I'm in here.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.321
Do not open that.
There's dynamite, mega unstable.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.498
- I know.
- So did Dr. Arzt.

25:02.585 --> 25:05.167
Then I was wiping him
out of my shirt two days later.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.245
- Dude, it's time to go.
- No, not yet.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.707
He's opening a crate of dynamite,
and said he wanted to kill himself.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.758
I can't kill myself.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.336
- What?
- Even if I wanted to,

25:15.431 --> 25:18.138
trust me, I do, I can't kill myself.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.301
Which is why I want you to do it for me.

25:21.396 --> 25:22.852
What are you talking about?

25:25.483 --> 25:29.271
What I'm talking about, Jack,
is that, well, Jacob touched me.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.567
And when Jacob touches you,
well, it's considered a gift.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.566
Except it's not a gift at all.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.743
It's a curse.

25:40.123 --> 25:44.082
- Dude! Seriously, let's go now!
- Why do you want to die?

25:44.919 --> 25:47.251
I devoted my life,

25:47.338 --> 25:51.672
longer than you can
possibly imagine, in service of a man

25:51.759 --> 25:54.466
who told me that everything
was happening for a reason.

25:54.554 --> 25:58.923
That he had a plan.
A plan that l was a part of.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.849
And, when the time was right,
that he'd share it with me.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.803
And now that man's gone. So...

26:05.606 --> 26:09.645
Why do I want to die? Because I just
found out my entire life had no purpose.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.900
Now, ifl light this myself,
it won't work.

26:15.199 --> 26:16.814
But you can light it for me, Jack.

26:17.785 --> 26:20.026
I made the fuse long enough
so you'll have time to get out.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.529
Jack, please tell me
you're not considering this.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.999
If he wants to die,
there's nothing to stop him.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.834
Thank you.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.497
Now...

27:05.666 --> 27:07.042
...let's talk.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.085
Jack! Dude, we got to go.
The guy's crazy, and I know crazy!

27:18.179 --> 27:20.545
- Go ahead. We'll be all right.
- You're gonna blow up!

27:20.640 --> 27:22.505
Got to talk to him, Hurley. Just go.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.183
- No, I'm not going without you.
- Hurley, I'll be fine.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.652
When you change your mind,
I'll be a mile away.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.443
You should go with him, Jack.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.988
- No, Richard, I shouldn't.
- Then you're gonna die.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.492
I don't think either
one of us is gonna die.

27:44.622 --> 27:47.785
- What makes you think that?
- | just came from a lighthouse...

27:49.210 --> 27:52.668
...where my name was etched in wood
on a dial that turned a mirror...

27:54.257 --> 27:57.169
...that somehow reflected the image
of the house I grew up in.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.259
Jacob's lighthouse.

28:02.682 --> 28:05.173
He got Hurley to bring me
because he wanted me to see

28:05.268 --> 28:08.977
what was reflected in that mirror.
For some reason, he wanted me to know

28:09.063 --> 28:11.475
that he'd been watching me
ever since I was a kid.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.938
- Why?
- l have no idea why.

28:18.656 --> 28:21.773
But I'm willing to bet you
that if Jacob went to that trouble...

28:22.535 --> 28:25.197
...that he brought me to this island
for a reason,

28:25.288 --> 28:27.779
and it's not to blow up
sitting with you right now.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.161
That's a big risk you're taking.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.376
- Yes.
- What if you're wrong?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.829
I'm not.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.077
Wanna try another stick?

29:12.001 --> 29:13.662
All right, Jack.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.211
You seem to have all the answers.
So, now what?

29:18.633 --> 29:20.214
We go back to where we started.

29:51.499 --> 29:52.659
Hello, Ben.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.831
What are you doing here?

30:00.257 --> 30:03.715
- Visiting. What are you doing?
- l'm digging my own grave.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.214
Why?

30:07.098 --> 30:09.555
Because you talked me
into killing Jacob.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.217
Do you see that woman eating a mango?

30:13.312 --> 30:16.600
She's his bodyguard
and she knows what I did.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.520
You've got what you wanted
because she's going to kill me.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.272
I don't want you to die, Ben.

30:23.406 --> 30:26.364
In fact, I went back to
the statue to get you, but you'd gone.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.157
Get me? For what?

30:29.245 --> 30:32.328
l'm gathering a group
to leave this place for good.

30:33.374 --> 30:38.164
But, once we're gone, someone's gonna
need to be in charge of the island.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.748
Me?

30:41.257 --> 30:43.418
I can't think of a
better man for the job.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.752
It doesn't seem very likely, does it,
under the circumstances?

30:48.264 --> 30:49.970
How am I gonna get away from...

30:55.438 --> 30:57.850
Come to the other island,
to the Hydra Station.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.055
That's where we'll be.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.648
She'll come after me.

31:01.736 --> 31:04.022
Two hundred yards inland,
there's a tree in a clearing

31:04.113 --> 31:06.525
with a rifle leaning up against it.
If you go now,

31:06.615 --> 31:09.277
you'll get there first
and you'll have the drop on her.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.363
But don't hesitate.

31:12.955 --> 31:13.944
She won't.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.167
See you soon, Ben.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.014
Hey!

31:45.654 --> 31:47.110
Come in.

31:50.785 --> 31:54.073
Linus, I don't have time to listen
to you complain about detention.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.449
That's not why I'm here.
I want you to read something.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.916
Well, if this is some attempt
to revive your little club...

32:07.009 --> 32:09.967
Those are 30 e-mails
that cover a three-month period.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.763
It's pretty lascivious stuff.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.350
Which would be fine if it was private,
but they seem to describe acts

32:18.437 --> 32:20.678
that took place on school property.

32:21.774 --> 32:27.690
Acts which, morality aside,
I think the school board would frown on.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.361
Not to mention your wife.

32:33.786 --> 32:34.775
What do you want?

32:35.663 --> 32:36.823
Yourjob.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.916
You're gonna resign...

32:40.543 --> 32:42.033
...for, I don't know...

32:42.962 --> 32:46.454
...personal reasons, health, your call.
But, with your resignation,

32:46.549 --> 32:49.916
you're gonna recommend the school board
hire me as your replacement.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.344
And the irony of all this
is that they hold you in such esteem...

32:55.141 --> 32:56.722
...that I'll get the job.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.055
So, do we have an understanding?

33:06.235 --> 33:07.566
Linus...

33:08.612 --> 33:10.477
May | read you an e-mail?

33:19.623 --> 33:22.535
"Dear Principal Reynolds,
I would appreciate it if you could

33:22.626 --> 33:26.335
write a letter of recommendation
to Yale on my behalf.

33:26.422 --> 33:30.540
It would mean the world to me.
Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau."

33:31.969 --> 33:34.460
It's a funny thing about
recommendations, Linus.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.046
They work both ways.

33:38.017 --> 33:42.010
So, I put the ball back in your court.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.935
You can execute your little
Machiavellian maneuvers.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.861
Go for my job, sit at my desk.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.733
But, alas, there will be
an unfortunate side effect.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.901
I will torch Miss Rousseau
and her future.

33:59.747 --> 34:04.116
Is my job, my power,
that important to you?

34:08.047 --> 34:12.962
So. What will it be, Dr. Linus?

34:31.570 --> 34:34.528
Drop it. Put the gun down!

34:51.465 --> 34:53.001
What are you waiting for?

34:56.220 --> 34:57.676
I want to explain.

34:58.681 --> 34:59.670
Explain what?

35:00.432 --> 35:04.266
I want to explain
that I know what you're feeling.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.101
You have no idea what I'm feeling.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.932
I watched my daughter,
Alex, die in front of me.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.644
And it was my fault.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.525
I had a chance to save her.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.194
But I chose the island.

35:24.957 --> 35:25.992
Over her.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.075
All in the name of Jacob.

35:32.548 --> 35:35.210
l sacrificed everything for him.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.802
And he didn't even care.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.138
l stabbed him.
I was... so angry.

35:47.938 --> 35:53.183
Confused. l was terrified
that l was about to lose

35:53.277 --> 35:56.940
the only thing that had
ever mattered to me, my power.

35:59.158 --> 36:02.025
But the thing that really mattered...

36:04.330 --> 36:06.070
...was already gone.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.036
I'm sorry that I killed Jacob.

36:11.628 --> 36:12.754
I am.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.750
And I do not expect you to forgive me,

36:15.841 --> 36:20.756
because... I can never forgive myself.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.638
Then what do you want?

36:26.602 --> 36:28.888
Just... let me leave.

36:31.565 --> 36:32.930
Where will you go?

36:35.819 --> 36:37.400
To Locke.

36:38.489 --> 36:39.729
Why?

36:39.823 --> 36:43.156
Because he's the only one
that'll have me.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.447
I'll have you.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.213
- Dr. Linus.
- Hello, Alex.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.962
l was just coming by
to thank Principal Reynolds.

37:43.053 --> 37:46.045
He wrote me the most incredible letter
of recommendation.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.676
Wow. Wonderful.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.424
Did you have something to do with it?

37:50.936 --> 37:55.475
I mean, I thought he might say some
nice things, but he really went all out.

37:55.566 --> 37:58.603
No, it wasn't me. But I always say
you're a great student.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.810
Obviously, lwasn't
the only one who noticed.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.110
- Thanks...
- Linus,

38:02.197 --> 38:04.404
what the hell are you doing
in my office?

38:05.784 --> 38:10.073
Just dropping off the detention sign-up
sheet for the week, per your request.

38:10.164 --> 38:12.200
Just put it on my desk.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.953
- So, will I see you at History Club?
- You mean when it's back on?

38:19.047 --> 38:21.083
Oh, no, we've got our old slot back.

38:21.175 --> 38:24.008
Principal Reynolds found someone
to cover detention. Right?

38:25.888 --> 38:29.847
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, then, see you at four.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.184
Bye.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.568
Hey. Did you do it?

38:44.740 --> 38:46.651
- No.
- No?

38:47.701 --> 38:49.316
No? Wait.

38:49.411 --> 38:53.029
- What about my parking space?
- You can have mine.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.816
Do you need a hand?

40:07.239 --> 40:08.900
Please help me with the tarp.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.652
Sir, there are people on the beach.

42:13.782 --> 42:16.239
- Should we stop?
- No.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.452
- Proceed as planned.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Widmore.
