34:48.293 --> 34:50.379
Really? Working for Dad?

34:50.838 --> 34:53.174
Just for the moment. He just asked me
to help him out with some stuff.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.217
Huh.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.842
[♪♪♪]

34:55.927 --> 35:00.223
-When did he ask you?
-Mmm. I don't know. A few hours ago.

35:04.936 --> 35:05.770
Hm.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.941
[♪♪♪]

35:12.360 --> 35:15.029
Connor, with all due respect,
what are you doing here?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.823
I'm going home.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.616
You offered me a job.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.326
That's not good enough.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.953
And you need me.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.037
And why is that?

35:23.121 --> 35:27.208
Because I single-handedly beat your law firm
in a case that I had no right to win.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.920
You need me because I'm smart, I'm aggressive...

35:31.003 --> 35:32.004
Humble.

35:33.005 --> 35:37.844
When necessary. And you need me
because I can help you and your firm.

35:38.261 --> 35:42.014
But while we do some environmental law,
mostly we do litigation.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.268
And that's exactly why I got into law
in the first place.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.353
Fine. I'm interested.

35:49.897 --> 35:55.695
So how did you end up
going into environmental law?

35:55.778 --> 35:56.612
Well...

35:58.406 --> 36:03.119
I let others choose my path for me.
And I'm done doing that.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.079
Hmm.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.588
We lost this case to the city.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.549
You have 48 hours to show me
how we could have won it.

36:17.633 --> 36:20.219
You want me to dazzle you?

36:21.345 --> 36:22.430
If you want a job.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.515
[♪♪♪]

36:34.650 --> 36:38.487
-I think your break's almost over.
-Can I get five more minutes, boss?

36:38.571 --> 36:40.740
It's not how it works. Gonna have to dock you.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.707
You know, I don't let a lot of people in.

36:49.790 --> 36:54.170
-So no one knows the real Trace Riley?
-Not a lot of people, no.

36:55.838 --> 36:59.926
-Because of the business?
-Not just that.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.554
When I was a kid, my family wasn't big
on discussing their feelings.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.724
Sometimes it's just easier that way.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.351
So you don't get hurt.

37:08.434 --> 37:12.063
So you get hurt less. It's, uh, safer.

37:15.316 --> 37:19.362
You know, you don't have
to protect yourself around me.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.821
[♪♪♪]

37:20.905 --> 37:22.782
You don't have to hide how you really feel.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.288
KEVIN:
Your ride awaits.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.332
-You all set to leave?
-Almost.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.210
Just finishing this note from the playwright.

37:34.293 --> 37:37.213
So you finally found out
what the real you has to say.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.297
Uh...

37:39.507 --> 37:42.677
Yeah, kind of, I guess. Not really.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.887
I did find out why I was stressing out, though.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.099
It's because I have nothing to stress out about.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.228
Yeah, that's strange, having everything work out.

37:53.479 --> 37:58.567
Sarah and I are just happy,
planning our future together,

37:58.651 --> 38:00.945
our wedding dinner, everything else.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.031
And I keep expecting that I'm gonna wake up.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.576
-I know, right? Like it's all just a dream.
-Yeah, that it won't last.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.330
But then I think...

38:12.957 --> 38:15.584
maybe we deserve this.

38:17.086 --> 38:22.967
You know, like, for just a moment,
everything's good.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.344
And everything works out as we planned.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.804
[♪♪♪]

38:31.767 --> 38:34.270
Well, we got through the day.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.563
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]

38:37.189 --> 38:40.860
-And tomorrow will be better.
-Always is.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.987
That reminds me, I got you a present.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.365
-Really?
-It's okay if you didn't get me anything.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.993
Even though it was the first day
and you should've, but--

38:49.076 --> 38:50.703
-I'm kidding. Close your eyes.
-Now?

38:50.786 --> 38:51.620
Mm-hm.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.709
-Okay.
-Aww, a calendar.

38:56.792 --> 39:00.087
So we will always know what day it is.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.382
This would've been a lot more useful
than a spice rack.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.508
[♪♪♪]

39:04.592 --> 39:06.552
It's okay, you don't have to get me anything.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.221
-Got it.
-Got it.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.081
Are you all right?

39:35.164 --> 39:38.793
I've been better. Hasn't been
a great month for my reputation.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.586
Yeah, well, it's really difficult

39:40.669 --> 39:44.465
to see something
that you've built up just fall apart.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.383
Oh-ho.

39:48.010 --> 39:52.431
You know, I talked to Jess today.

39:52.515 --> 39:56.102
And she is very concerned about you and Megan.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.646
Oh?

39:58.729 --> 40:00.439
Yeah.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.857
How do you feel about it?

40:01.941 --> 40:06.946
Well, I think you've always had something special.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.656
And I want you to be happy.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.741
[♪♪♪]

40:10.825 --> 40:12.076
Thank you, Mom.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.124
Admiral? What course will we be taking?

40:18.207 --> 40:22.002
It be morning soon, so we point the bow
toward the rising sun.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.005
CAITLYN: Aye, aye, admiral.
But what if there not be land?

40:25.089 --> 40:27.633
CARRIE: Then we'll be setting a new course.
-That's you. Let's go.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.593
CAITLYN:
Time to abandon hope.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.263
Trace. What are you doing here?

40:32.346 --> 40:34.181
I told the girls I'd come by and help out.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.725
Oh, um...

40:37.810 --> 40:41.480
Thank you for, um, building the sets.
They look better than the originals.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.774
Yeah, no worries.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.486
You know, I heard about the Porter Fund.

40:48.821 --> 40:52.283
-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm better now.

40:52.950 --> 40:53.993
Good.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.162
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING]

40:56.245 --> 40:58.122
I, um... Heh-heh.

40:58.205 --> 41:01.000
I have to go do a, uh, costume change.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.376
Yeah, yeah, sure.

44:08.395 --> 44:11.732
-There's a timing for everything, Mick.
-Yeah, including when to retaliate.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.859
As of today, I'm firing back.

44:13.942 --> 44:17.988
According to our records, your occupancy permit
didn't go into effect until yesterday.

You're getting engaged?

44:19.907 --> 44:23.452

-Brian Higgins. We should do lunch.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.954
So that's her.

44:26.038 --> 44:29.124
-You still have feelings for her, don't you?
-It's not that simple.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.629
have to go.
