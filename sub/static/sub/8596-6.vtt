WEBVTT

00:01.211 --> 00:03.338
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.546 --> 00:04.422
Clarke, on radio:
Carl Emerson,

00:04.631 --> 00:05.799
I have a message
for your leader.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.051
I will not
stop until my
people are free.

00:08.259 --> 00:12.430
If you don't let
them go, I will
irradiate level 5.

00:12.639 --> 00:15.809
We all have pain.
Some of it is physical.

00:16.017 --> 00:19.270
It'll make it
go away.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.314
Time to get
back to work, raven.

00:21.523 --> 00:23.024
The city
of light is real.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.318
And that's supposed to
take me to the city of light?

00:34.536 --> 00:35.954
On your feet.

00:36.162 --> 00:38.498
The grounders out there
will attack this camp.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.958
We wait, we die.

00:40.166 --> 00:43.128
This land is ours now.

00:43.336 --> 00:46.381
Resist, and you will be
greeted by death.

00:46.589 --> 00:47.799
Here we stand
on the brink

00:48.008 --> 00:50.552
of another war,
a war you could stop.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.429
Blood must not
have blood.

01:14.034 --> 01:16.828
Mm...Mm...

01:21.416 --> 01:25.962
Hey, hey, it's OK.
You're OK.

01:27.881 --> 01:29.632
What were you
dreaming about?

01:29.841 --> 01:31.217
Commanders
before me.

01:31.426 --> 01:33.053
They speak to me
in my sleep.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.889
I saw their deaths--

01:36.097 --> 01:39.601
at war, at the hands
of an assassin.

01:39.809 --> 01:40.977
It was just
a nightmare.

01:41.186 --> 01:45.356
No. No.
It's a warning.

01:45.565 --> 01:49.652
They think I'm
betraying their legacy.

01:49.861 --> 01:53.698
Jus drein just daun
has always,

01:53.907 --> 01:56.659
always been the way
of our people.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.788
Listen to me.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.832
A cease fire
is not a betrayal.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.085
What you did
on that battlefield

02:05.293 --> 02:08.129
stopped a war.

02:08.338 --> 02:12.759
Your legacy
will be peace.

02:23.645 --> 02:27.065
Oh, um, that's, um--

02:27.273 --> 02:29.609
it's not finished yet.

02:34.864 --> 02:36.491
Enter.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.287
Pardon me, Heda.

02:41.496 --> 02:43.957
I didn't realize
you were busy.

02:49.379 --> 02:51.631
Are you going to tell me
what's in the box, or not?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.049
Forgive me.

02:53.258 --> 02:55.760
This is a gift from
king roan of Azgeda

02:55.969 --> 02:58.221
for Wanheda.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.140
The messenger said
this is both proof

03:00.348 --> 03:02.851
of Azgeda's loyalty
to the coalition

03:03.059 --> 03:07.230
and an answer to a
yet-unanswered question.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.940
May I?

03:10.316 --> 03:12.443
Open it.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.660
Emerson.

03:27.041 --> 03:31.171
Stop him!
Get him out of here!

03:31.379 --> 03:33.506
Put him in a cage now!

03:33.715 --> 03:34.883
I'm fine.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.350
We done here?

04:25.558 --> 04:27.435
10-meter draw,
and I'm good.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.525
Pike's detail
is still at it--

04:34.734 --> 04:35.902
soil and
water samples.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.654
Any idea what
they're up to?

04:37.862 --> 04:39.656
No, but considering how
heavily they're armed,

04:39.864 --> 04:42.325
I don't think they want
anyone to find out.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.412
- Crap.
- What?

04:46.621 --> 04:48.957
There's a
grounder kid. Hang on.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.131
Hello there.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.468
Don't be scared.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.012
We can't let him go.

05:03.221 --> 05:04.973
He'll tell his
people he saw us.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.684
Octavia,
please respond.

05:07.892 --> 05:08.893
Hannah.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.612
Fan out. With me.

05:19.821 --> 05:21.572
Octavia, you there?

05:21.781 --> 05:22.865
Huh!

05:23.992 --> 05:24.909
They're going
after the kid.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.411
I'm trying
to cut them off.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.251
Split up.

05:39.007 --> 05:41.050
Uh!

05:42.844 --> 05:45.179
Uh!

05:49.142 --> 05:51.144
Shh shh shh shh shh.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.526
We lost him.

05:58.735 --> 06:00.278
Double back
towards the river.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.864
He can't have
gotten far.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.921
Mm.

06:24.594 --> 06:25.845
Mm.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.854
Hey, hey...

06:35.980 --> 06:39.609
You're welcome.
Ah...

06:39.817 --> 06:42.862
- Kane.
- I'm here. You OK?

06:43.071 --> 06:45.823
You need to find out
what pike is up to

06:46.032 --> 06:47.533
right now.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.160
Whatever it is,
they were willing

06:49.369 --> 06:50.953
to kill a kid
to keep it quiet.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.956
We're on it.
You stay safe.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.586
How about now?
Anything?

06:58.795 --> 07:02.799
Nope. All good.
Pain's gone.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.009
Hmm, your leg's--

07:05.218 --> 07:07.720
still doesn't work.
I know.

07:07.929 --> 07:10.306
I just don't
hurt anymore.

07:13.643 --> 07:15.436
Hey, hold on.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.192
Pupils aren't dilated.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.197
Jaha gave me the key
to the city of light,

07:26.406 --> 07:28.825
Abby, not drugs.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.828
Yeah. Let's see what
the blood tests say.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.539
Thought you'd
be happy for me.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.166
I am.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.753
It's just unusual for pain
to subside this quickly.

07:40.962 --> 07:44.215
Uh, so
am I all clear?

07:44.424 --> 07:46.759
Apparently.

07:48.094 --> 07:50.221
Let Sinclair know
that I said

07:50.430 --> 07:52.473
it was OK for you
to go back to work,

07:52.682 --> 07:54.434
but you're benched
again if I find

07:54.642 --> 07:56.769
anything abnormal
in those tests.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.981
You won't.
Thanks, doc.

08:06.821 --> 08:08.698
You step aside in case
someone answers.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.783
I told you,
no one's home.

08:17.165 --> 08:18.666
What?

08:18.875 --> 08:20.126
Bet you didn't
think we'd be

08:20.334 --> 08:21.335
breaking the law
together when

08:22.044 --> 08:24.172
this isn't
a game, Nate.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.923
If we don't find out
what pike's up to,

08:26.132 --> 08:27.341
more people
will die.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.386
Then let's not
get caught.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.059
Chancellor pike,
good to see you.

08:37.268 --> 08:39.979
Hey, you put it somewhere
smart, out of sight.

08:40.188 --> 08:42.940
I'll buy you
some time.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.990
There you are.

08:51.199 --> 08:52.992
We need to talk about these
things Jaha's distributing.

08:53.201 --> 08:55.119
No, we don't. That's
Abby's department.

08:55.328 --> 08:56.871
I have much more
immediate concerns.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.581
Like the imprisoned
grounders?

08:58.789 --> 09:00.958
Interned for their safety
as well as ours.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.752
They came in
for our help.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.961
If we're not gonna
give it to them,

09:05.171 --> 09:06.255
They're a liability.

09:06.464 --> 09:07.924
Let them go,
they'll tell their people

09:08.132 --> 09:09.425
what they know about us--
our defenses and capabilities.

09:09.634 --> 09:10.801
We're talking
about Lincoln here.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.512
No. We're talking
about the enemy.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.013
Not all grounders
are the enemy.

09:14.222 --> 09:15.515
Kane, we've been
through this, all right?

09:15.723 --> 09:16.933
The election
decided it.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.352
Public opinion is
a funny thing, Charles.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.356
My job is to keep us safe,
not to be liked.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.399
Then keep up
the good work.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.635
They seem
pretty happy.

09:56.013 --> 09:59.684
Yeah.
They sure do.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.145
A lot more of them
today, too.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.189
I know
you're tempted,

10:05.398 --> 10:09.819
but let me figure out
what it is first, OK?

10:16.367 --> 10:19.328
OK. Let's get
this meeting started.

10:19.537 --> 10:22.748
Welcome farm station's
own Monty green

10:22.957 --> 10:25.001
and factory girl Zoe Monroe

10:25.209 --> 10:27.920
as we begin our next
crucial phase--

10:28.129 --> 10:32.883
expansion and salvation,
and this will lead the way.

10:33.092 --> 10:34.343
Dirt?

10:34.552 --> 10:37.597
Soil--fertile, arable soil,

10:37.805 --> 10:40.808
vastly more rich than anything
we've found since landing.

10:41.017 --> 10:43.769
We'll clear the trees
and plant within the month.

10:43.978 --> 10:46.522
We start
with soybeans and corn.

10:46.731 --> 10:48.274
They grow
the fastest.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.361
What's wrong, Monty?
Don't like corn?

10:52.570 --> 10:55.239
I've never had
corn, actually.

10:55.448 --> 10:57.450
Is this where
we're going?

10:57.658 --> 10:58.909
That's right.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.244
There's
a village here.

11:00.453 --> 11:01.704
What about the people
who live there?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.748
Sector 4.
We talked about this.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.124
The people there
are not a threat.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.752
We need that land.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.630
With the loss of mount
weather's resources,

11:10.838 --> 11:13.466
Arkadia will be starving
in less than a year.

11:17.887 --> 11:20.056
With all
due respect, sir,

11:20.264 --> 11:22.433
you still haven't answered
Monty's question.

11:22.642 --> 11:24.226
You know
the answer.

11:24.435 --> 11:26.312
Every field must be
cleared of stones

11:26.520 --> 11:27.730
before it's tilled.

11:27.938 --> 11:28.981
We were
spotted by a child,

11:29.190 --> 11:30.858
so they'll be
expecting us,

11:31.067 --> 11:33.486
but they lost their fighters
when we took out the army.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.696
We don't expect
resistance.

11:35.905 --> 11:39.033
They're grounders.
They'll resist.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.828
Even if they don't,

11:43.037 --> 11:45.456
the commander's
message was clear.

11:45.665 --> 11:47.166
Blood must not have blood.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.668
That doesn't mean
we can start taking--

11:48.876 --> 11:50.127
what would you
prefer,

11:50.336 --> 11:51.671
die fighting
for your home

11:51.879 --> 11:53.881
or starve to death?

11:55.966 --> 11:57.927
Will you do what
needs to be done

11:58.135 --> 12:00.596
for your people
to survive, or not?

12:11.774 --> 12:14.527
We'll do what
needs to be done.

12:23.119 --> 12:24.412
You're letting her
cloud your judgment at a time--

12:24.620 --> 12:25.621
I thought you were
supposed to be loyal.

12:25.830 --> 12:28.416
I am, but you are
too personally in--

12:28.624 --> 12:30.251
here she is.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.794
You wanted to
see me, commander?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
Yes.

12:34.088 --> 12:37.174
I need to discuss the fate
of the last Mountain man.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.093
I believe he
deserves death.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.137
She can speak
for herself, Titus.

12:46.142 --> 12:48.602
Titus is right.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.191
You see?

12:54.400 --> 12:57.862
It is human nature
to need vengeance.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.614
Only once satiated
can there be peace.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.659
- That is our way.
- That was our way.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.373
Clarke...

13:14.170 --> 13:16.505
So blood must not
have blood applies

13:16.714 --> 13:19.008
only when it is
my people who bleed.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.427
That was about
stopping a war.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.637
This is about
finishing one.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.432
I'm sorry, but if
you want my advice,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.893
I agree with Titus.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.353
He deserves to die
for what he did.

13:31.562 --> 13:35.191
I'm not looking for advice.
I'm looking for a decision.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.860
He was gifted
to you.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.945
Crime he stands
charged with

13:40.154 --> 13:42.239
is against
your people.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.452
So what will it be,
then, Clarke...

13:48.954 --> 13:51.540
Banishment from
our lands forever

13:51.749 --> 13:55.211
or death by 49 cuts
from your hand?

13:55.419 --> 13:57.421
You have till sundown
to decide.

14:16.982 --> 14:20.861
Oh, finally.
Where's my horse?

14:21.070 --> 14:22.988
Outside. Nice
to see you, too.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.490
Octavia, wait a second.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.075
You actually think
that a bunch of grounders

14:26.283 --> 14:27.618
are gonna give up their homes
because you asked them to?

14:27.827 --> 14:30.830
If it's that or
be wiped out, maybe.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.456
OK. Then what if
they don't leave?

14:32.665 --> 14:35.876
Then we're leading
our people into an ambush.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.711
Maybe if you just
talk to your brother--

14:37.920 --> 14:40.422
my brother is on
the wrong side.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.799
So, what, then,
we don't even try?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.259
What do you
think happens

14:43.467 --> 14:44.802
when Lexa finds out
that Skaikru

14:45.010 --> 14:48.055
massacred another
grounder village?

14:50.182 --> 14:52.935
War, more
dead friends.

14:54.353 --> 14:59.149
Stop the attack,
stop a war.

15:22.006 --> 15:23.507
Feeling better?

15:23.716 --> 15:26.176
Better? I feel
incredible.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.012
Thank you,
both of you.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.763
Thanks you, raven.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.849
More are joining
the city of light

15:32.057 --> 15:33.058
because of you.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.770
Anything I could
do to help.

15:38.439 --> 15:39.773
What?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.775
Now that you're back
on the engineering core--

15:41.984 --> 15:42.985
uh, thanks to Alie--

15:43.193 --> 15:44.820
we'd like you to do
a job for us.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.238
Name it.

15:46.447 --> 15:48.240
I've been looking for
something for a long time,

15:48.449 --> 15:51.118
searching for it
in scavenged technology.

15:51.327 --> 15:53.913
It's one of the reasons
we came to Arkadia first.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.998
I believe that
version two of my code

15:56.206 --> 15:58.542
is somewhere in the computer
system of the ark.

15:58.751 --> 16:00.210
Why did there need
to be a version two?

16:00.419 --> 16:01.253
Was there something
wrong with you?

16:01.462 --> 16:02.504
Oh, nothing's
wrong with her.

16:02.713 --> 16:03.631
No offense.

16:03.839 --> 16:04.798
I'm just saying,
programmers

16:05.007 --> 16:06.342
and engineers
generally don't go

16:06.550 --> 16:07.551
to a version two
unless there is--

16:07.760 --> 16:08.928
raven--

16:09.136 --> 16:10.846
of course.

16:11.055 --> 16:13.849
Of course
I'll help you,

16:14.058 --> 16:15.351
but I got to say,
I'm fairly certain

16:15.559 --> 16:17.102
if there was an AI
on the ark,

16:17.311 --> 16:18.270
I would know.

16:18.479 --> 16:19.939
It will likely be
a dormant program,

16:20.147 --> 16:23.609
that or
an unfinished one.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.736
If you can gain me
access to the mainframe,

16:25.945 --> 16:27.279
I can search for
and download

16:27.488 --> 16:29.114
any residual code.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.159
Sounds like
a plan, red.

16:32.368 --> 16:34.244
See you on
the other side.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.668
Why would you not tell
her the truth about me?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.753
John Murphy
knew the truth,

16:42.962 --> 16:44.630
and we lost him,
remember?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.966
John Murphy never saw
the city of light.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.635
Call it an abundance
of caution, then.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.471
We are, after all,
asking her to find

16:52.680 --> 16:53.973
an upgrade for
a computer program

16:54.181 --> 16:56.558
that ended the world.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.197
That's a lot
of firepower.

17:10.406 --> 17:11.991
Let's hope
we don't need it.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.492
What's the mission?

17:13.701 --> 17:15.577
Planning
for our future.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.871
You know, that looks
a lot like our past.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.582
We are building
a life here,

17:20.791 --> 17:23.627
now trying to make peace
with a people

17:23.836 --> 17:25.295
who only
understand war.

17:25.504 --> 17:27.589
Damn right.

17:27.798 --> 17:30.634
Hannah, you just
got your son back.

17:30.843 --> 17:33.178
Don't send him
out there to die.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.431
No one's dying today.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.479
Now let's move out.

17:47.735 --> 17:50.154
Hey, where the hell
have you been?

17:50.362 --> 17:51.989
Oh, I lost
the damn horse.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.576
Actually, the horse
lost me, but--

17:55.784 --> 17:57.828
I'm glad you're OK.

17:58.037 --> 18:00.247
I wish you didn't
have to go with them.

18:00.456 --> 18:02.041
Today, Bryan.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.420
Duty calls.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.798
Yeah. Hey,
be careful, please.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.595
All right.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.217
AI nou na bash yo op.

19:01.016 --> 19:04.019
Liar.
I've seen your face.

19:04.228 --> 19:06.146
You were at the battle
of the Mountain.

19:08.524 --> 19:12.528
Your guns killed
our brothers and sisters,

19:12.736 --> 19:14.530
warriors sent
by the commander

19:14.738 --> 19:16.490
to keep you safe.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.118
I'm sorry
for your loss,

19:19.326 --> 19:22.121
but I'm here to warn you
that the soldiers

19:22.329 --> 19:25.374
who did that
are coming here now.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.460
They want your land,
and they will kill

19:28.669 --> 19:31.296
all of you to get it.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.049
You need to leave
this place right now.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.759
Are you
threatening us?

19:35.968 --> 19:38.637
Uh! Ah!

19:38.846 --> 19:40.430
Rrgh!

19:53.527 --> 19:56.155
You're the one
who saved Gavriel?

20:02.578 --> 20:04.872
Don't leave.

20:08.667 --> 20:12.462
Couldn't have said something
before I got kicked in the face?

20:18.343 --> 20:21.346
Chronic pain just doesn't
go away overnight.

20:21.555 --> 20:24.433
The data
says it does.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.435
Elevated levels of
serotonin and dopamine

20:26.643 --> 20:27.811
in raven's blood
are consistent

20:28.020 --> 20:29.229
with her claims,
and since it's

20:29.438 --> 20:31.607
within normal
limits, I'd say

20:31.815 --> 20:35.527
it's not
drug-induced.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.197
You look
disappointed.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.450
No. Surprised.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.785
We've all been
through so much

20:43.994 --> 20:48.582
that it's hard
to recognize hope,

20:48.790 --> 20:52.211
even when it's right
in front of us.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.216
Jackson,
can you go check

20:57.424 --> 20:59.009
on the grounder
patients in lockup?

20:59.218 --> 21:00.677
Report back
to me, OK?

21:06.642 --> 21:09.853
Octavia should be
at the village by now,

21:10.062 --> 21:13.148
but if she can't convince
them to evacuate--

21:13.357 --> 21:15.317
you have done
everything you can.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.860
No.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.657
No, I haven't.
I let this happen.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.912
I demanded
an election...

21:33.043 --> 21:34.920
And now we have
chancellor pike.

21:35.587 --> 21:39.299
We're on the brink
of a war we can't win,

21:39.508 --> 21:42.052
and all I can do
to stop it

21:42.261 --> 21:46.056
is send kids
into harm's way.

21:46.265 --> 21:50.269
Hey, in case
you haven't noticed,

21:50.477 --> 21:53.522
they're not kids
anymore.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.943
With Clarke gone,
Bellamy's the key.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.486
I've been trying
to reach him,

21:59.695 --> 22:01.947
but pike's influence
is strong,

22:02.155 --> 22:03.991
and he really
believes he's doing

22:04.199 --> 22:05.659
the right thing.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.744
Everybody
always does.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.632
What was that?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.680
Let's call it hope.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.236
You can pet him
if you want.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.329
Gavriel...

22:51.705 --> 22:53.790
Go on.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.712
His parents
were warriors,

22:58.920 --> 23:01.256
both killed
by Skaikru guns.

23:01.465 --> 23:03.675
You decided
to leave.

23:03.884 --> 23:07.804
As you say, we're no
match for Skaikru.

23:08.013 --> 23:13.143
What you're doing is as brave
as going to battle, Semet.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.863
Uh! Agh! Ah!

23:25.072 --> 23:26.573
Ah...Ah...

23:35.874 --> 23:38.043
What is this?

23:38.251 --> 23:41.713
You think you know us?
You know nothing, girl.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.340
Rragh!

23:46.843 --> 23:50.430
All set.
We just got to patch you in.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.391
Can I ask you a question?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.643
Why would the second
AI be in space?

23:54.851 --> 23:57.104
My creator thought
she needed

23:57.312 --> 23:59.356
a more secure
work environment.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.525
So did you go, too?

24:01.733 --> 24:03.944
No. I was
the reason

24:04.152 --> 24:06.446
she wanted a more
secure environment.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.039
She's in.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.836
Who's in?

24:21.044 --> 24:23.130
Jasper, you don't have
access to be down here.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.132
Like that's
ever stopped me.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.926
Is that Jaha's
backpack?

24:32.973 --> 24:34.391
What do you want,
Jasper?

24:34.599 --> 24:36.184
Came to apologize.

24:36.393 --> 24:39.438
Might have stolen
Finn's ashes,

24:39.646 --> 24:42.399
spread them
at the Dropship.

24:42.607 --> 24:46.445
You're not...
Pissed?

24:46.653 --> 24:49.698
I'm not pissed.

24:49.906 --> 24:52.284
OK. What are you on,

24:52.492 --> 24:55.120
and how
do I get some?

24:57.873 --> 25:00.709
Simple.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.795
I just decided
I'd suffered long enough.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.547
So have you, Jasper.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.842
If you're ready,
Jaha has the key.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.807
Give us a minute.

25:25.317 --> 25:26.818
Carl Emerson,

25:27.027 --> 25:28.945
mount weather
security detail.

25:29.154 --> 25:31.198
I've heard
what they call you now--

25:31.406 --> 25:35.327
Wanheda,
commander of death.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.412
I should've known
it was you

25:37.621 --> 25:39.748
who told them how
to destroy the Mountain.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.876
I didn't destroy
mount weather.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.045
You did.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.673
381 people--

25:48.882 --> 25:51.551
182 men,

25:51.760 --> 25:54.763
173 women,

25:54.971 --> 25:57.390
26 children.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.521
Two of them were mine.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.901
Your president
gave us no choice.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.820
Raagh! Guh!

26:13.740 --> 26:16.159
What's the matter,

26:16.368 --> 26:20.080
you don't like to be
faced with your demons?

26:22.332 --> 26:24.000
If you want mercy,

26:24.209 --> 26:26.461
you're gonna have
to ask me for it.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.880
Ha ha ha!

26:29.089 --> 26:31.883
I don't want mercy.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.594
I want revenge.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.263
I want you
to suffer

26:36.471 --> 26:39.057
the same way
that I've suffered.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.187
You can kill me, Clarke.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.648
You can never escape
what you did.

26:46.856 --> 26:51.236
My pain ends today!
Yours has just begun!

27:01.580 --> 27:04.040
Titus, what are you
doing in my room?

27:07.752 --> 27:09.713
You spend so much time
talking about peace,

27:09.921 --> 27:11.798
I think it's time
we made peace

27:12.007 --> 27:14.092
with each other,
don't you?

27:15.719 --> 27:17.596
All right.

27:27.188 --> 27:30.775
I appreciate the predicament
you're in, Clarke. I do.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.361
After convincing Lexa
not to avenge the massacre

27:33.570 --> 27:35.947
of our army, it must
be hard for you

27:36.156 --> 27:39.075
to choose to take
your own revenge.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.077
Perhaps now you realize
how difficult

27:41.286 --> 27:44.080
this new policy will be
for our people to accept.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.874
This has nothing to do
with what happened

27:46.082 --> 27:47.876
to your army.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.253
Emerson is guilty.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.922
Wiping out my people
for the crimes of a few

27:53.131 --> 27:54.341
is not justice.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.176
Did you not
wipe out his people

27:56.384 --> 27:58.887
for what a few of them
did to yours?

27:59.095 --> 28:03.808
You're a leader, Clarke.
Lexa listens to you.

28:06.478 --> 28:09.356
Help me to protect her.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.650
Blood must not
have blood is folly.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.236
Our people will not
accept it, and I fear--

28:15.445 --> 28:18.156
I fear it will
get her killed.

28:21.409 --> 28:24.037
I can't help you
do something

28:24.245 --> 28:26.122
that leads to war
against my people.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.511
Then we're
at an impasse.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.155
Does it hurt?

29:00.323 --> 29:02.242
He's ready.

29:02.450 --> 29:05.245
Takes away pain.
It doesn't cause it.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.125
What if--what if you
don't have physical pain,

29:10.333 --> 29:13.586
and what if it's more--
it's more in your head?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
Pain is pain.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.758
Pain is pain.

29:18.967 --> 29:23.388
Your scars
run deep, Jasper.

29:24.889 --> 29:27.058
You only get scars
once you've healed.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.651
I'll see you
on the other side.

29:38.236 --> 29:40.488
Am I interrupting?

29:40.697 --> 29:44.242
Not at all.
Please join us.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.495
May I?

29:54.002 --> 29:56.755
You seem to be
working miracles with these.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.006
What is it?

29:58.214 --> 30:00.884
And I don't want to hear
that it's a key.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.845
Give me the science.

30:04.053 --> 30:05.972
It's all right.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.558
Tell her.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.935
It's a silicon-based device.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.271
Once ingested, the
filaments reconstitute

30:13.480 --> 30:14.939
in the brain stem

30:15.148 --> 30:17.484
and interrupt
pain receptors,

30:17.692 --> 30:20.403
inhibiting certain
neural pathways

30:20.612 --> 30:22.572
from firing.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.784
Should've
stuck with key.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.202
Ha ha!

30:27.410 --> 30:29.412
Would you mind if I run
some trials on it?

30:29.621 --> 30:33.500
I just want to make sure that
there aren't any side effects.

30:33.708 --> 30:37.045
Would you have given it to Wells
without testing it first?

30:38.838 --> 30:39.923
Wells?

30:42.801 --> 30:45.220
Your son.

30:48.223 --> 30:50.683
Yes.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.521
Yes. Of course.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.148
Jasper, I need
a minute, please.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.150
Could I have
that back?

30:59.359 --> 31:01.444
Now, please.

31:07.951 --> 31:10.286
I'm shutting you down.

31:11.830 --> 31:12.997
That's
not necessary.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.290
Please, Abby,
it's been so long

31:14.499 --> 31:16.376
since I've
thought of my son.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.086
Huh. I'm sorry.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.754
I'm not gonna let you
give this to anyone else

31:19.963 --> 31:22.590
until I get a chance
to look at it.

31:25.301 --> 31:28.179
I am only trying to
help eliminate pain,

31:28.388 --> 31:30.014
same as you.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.225
Whatever it is,

31:32.433 --> 31:36.563
it's eliminating
more than just pain.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.744
We cannot
let her stop us.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.622
Don't worry,
Thelonious.

32:00.628 --> 32:03.381
I'll keep
an eye on her.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.898
Mm...

32:30.450 --> 32:31.743
No.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.340
Mm!

32:53.973 --> 32:55.975
I don't hear
anything.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.644
Maybe
no one's home.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.194
Hello?
Anyone here?

33:06.402 --> 33:09.072
Maybe they saw
our lights and left.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.248
Mm...Uh!

33:23.795 --> 33:25.505
- Uh!
- Yah!

33:42.480 --> 33:44.983
Contact, two o'clock.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.402
Bellamy! Get them
out of there!

33:47.610 --> 33:49.737
It's a trap!

33:51.531 --> 33:55.410
- Fire!
- Incoming! Take cover!

33:55.618 --> 33:58.538
The smoke is poison!

34:01.916 --> 34:03.418
Fall back. Fall back!

34:03.626 --> 34:06.754
Stay away from the smoke.
Get back to the rover.

34:06.963 --> 34:11.092
Monty! Help!

34:11.300 --> 34:12.468
Let me go!

34:12.677 --> 34:14.512
Please help me!

34:14.721 --> 34:17.098
I have to save her.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.517
- Monroe!
- Monty!

34:19.726 --> 34:21.561
Stand down!
Fall back!

34:21.769 --> 34:23.438
Hannah, come on!

34:23.646 --> 34:24.856
Come on!

34:25.064 --> 34:28.860
Monroe! Monroe!

34:29.068 --> 34:31.029
Monroe!

34:34.949 --> 34:37.702
Uh!

34:37.910 --> 34:39.287
Monty!

34:41.539 --> 34:42.832
Monty, come on.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.126
We got to get her
away from the smoke.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.890
How the hell
did they know?

35:03.728 --> 35:05.813
Monroe?

35:07.565 --> 35:09.025
- Monroe.
- No.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.402
Your sister
did this.

35:11.611 --> 35:14.197
How the hell
did she know?

35:14.405 --> 35:16.908
We have traitors
in our camp.

36:13.965 --> 36:15.508
Wanheda...

36:24.642 --> 36:27.061
Vengeance is yours.

36:48.082 --> 36:49.542
No.

37:05.725 --> 37:08.895
I don't know if your death
would bring me peace.

37:09.103 --> 37:12.273
I just know
I don't deserve it.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.358
This man must die.

37:14.567 --> 37:17.153
If Skaikru will not take
his life, then Heda will.

37:17.361 --> 37:20.072
Heda will speak for herself.
Enough, Titus.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.909
What the hell
is this?

37:23.117 --> 37:25.703
I wouldn't be killing you
for what you've done.

37:25.912 --> 37:28.497
I'd be killing you for
what I've done.

37:51.062 --> 37:53.648
Wanheda knows this.

37:53.856 --> 37:58.486
Her actions show us a promise
for a new future,

37:58.694 --> 38:03.199
a world in which violence
does not always answer violence,

38:03.407 --> 38:07.119
a world in which
our children can flourish

38:07.328 --> 38:09.747
without the shadow
of death.

38:21.842 --> 38:24.971
This prisoner is
banished from my land.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.723
He will live,
but he will live

38:27.932 --> 38:30.893
with the ghosts of
those he has lost,

38:31.102 --> 38:33.437
haunted until
the end of his days

38:33.646 --> 38:36.190
by the knowledge
that he

38:36.399 --> 38:38.317
is the last
of his kind.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.745
May you live forever.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.470
You wanted
to see me, sir?

39:11.934 --> 39:15.479
- How you holding up?
- I've been better.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.815
Yeah. We all have.

39:20.568 --> 39:23.487
We need to talk
about your sister.

39:23.696 --> 39:25.990
Two of our people died
today because of her,

39:26.198 --> 39:28.451
not to mention
the ash-poisoned soil,

39:28.659 --> 39:29.994
making the land useless.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.621
The grounders did that.
Octavia tried to warn them.

39:32.830 --> 39:35.708
Yes, after
she warned them.

39:43.591 --> 39:47.261
Someone in this camp is
giving her information.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.388
I need to know who.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.474
We both know who.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.811
Kane.

39:59.982 --> 40:02.109
We have no proof.

40:03.861 --> 40:06.030
We need to find
me some.

40:07.740 --> 40:09.784
Yes, sir.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.496
You're dismissed.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.465
Please listen to me, OK?

40:24.673 --> 40:26.634
I don't know anything more
about Clarke, all right?

40:26.842 --> 40:29.887
Listen. I don't
know anything.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.932
Forget about Clarke.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.768
Tell me about this.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.479
We have some willing converts,
but no keys.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.147
That's gonna be
a problem.

40:40.356 --> 40:41.524
One problem at a time.

40:41.732 --> 40:43.150
There's no trace
of Alie's code

40:43.359 --> 40:44.819
or anything like it
on the ark.

40:45.027 --> 40:46.278
You were sure.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.280
I remain certain that
Becca went into space.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.241
Unfortunately, it
appears that she wasn't

40:50.449 --> 40:52.159
on any of
the 12 stations

40:52.368 --> 40:54.036
that made up
the ark.

40:54.245 --> 40:56.247
I'm sorry.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.749
I know how important
it is to you to find that AI.

40:58.958 --> 41:01.252
13.

41:03.337 --> 41:04.755
13?

41:04.964 --> 41:09.301
The ark was made up
of 12 stations--that's true--

41:09.510 --> 41:11.554
but there were
supposed to be 13.

41:11.762 --> 41:13.806
I didn't find that
on any of the data.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.809
That's because
it was scrubbed.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.769
Blowing a space station
out of the sky

41:18.978 --> 41:20.896
to get others to join
isn't exactly

41:21.105 --> 41:23.649
an inspirational
unity day story.

41:24.859 --> 41:25.985
No. Hold on. Hold on.

41:26.193 --> 41:27.027
Wait, wait. Just listen
to me, OK? Listen.

41:27.236 --> 41:29.613
Aagh! Aah!

41:29.822 --> 41:31.115
Tell me more.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.616
I wish I could.

41:32.825 --> 41:34.076
All I know is that
it happened...

41:34.285 --> 41:36.328
- Yah!
- Ah!

41:36.537 --> 41:38.038
Yaah!

41:38.247 --> 41:39.915
That it was
called Polaris.

41:40.124 --> 41:42.543
Agh! Aah!
