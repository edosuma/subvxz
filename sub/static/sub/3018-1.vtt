00:22.481 --> 00:25.567
Don't grieve,
Admiral.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.613
It is logical.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.578
The needs
of the many outweigh...

00:38.705 --> 00:41.708
the needs of the few.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.669
Or the one.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.838
And I have been

00:45.921 --> 00:48.340
and always shall be

00:48.423 --> 00:50.801
your friend.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.763
Live long...

00:56.473 --> 00:58.016
and prosper.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.315
We are assembled
here today

01:05.399 --> 01:09.319
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.366
This death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

01:14.449 --> 01:16.869
the sunrise
of a new world,

01:16.952 --> 01:18.787
a world
our beloved comrade

01:18.871 --> 01:21.248
gave his life to protect
and nourish.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.917
He did not feel
this sacrifice

01:24.001 --> 01:26.044
a vain or empty one.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.717
Of my friend,
I can only say this.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.057
Of all the souls
I have encountered

01:39.141 --> 01:41.059
in my travels,

01:41.143 --> 01:42.811
his was the most...

01:46.732 --> 01:47.816
human.

01:50.319 --> 01:53.822
Honors, hup!

02:12.591 --> 02:17.471
Space, the final frontier.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.224
These are
the continuing voyages

02:20.265 --> 02:23.727
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.229
Her ongoing mission-

02:25.270 --> 02:28.899
to explore
strange new worlds,

02:28.941 --> 02:31.860
to seek out
new life forms

02:31.944 --> 02:34.738
and new civilizations.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.074
To boldly go

02:37.115 --> 02:39.993
where no man has gone

02:40.077 --> 02:41.495
before.

05:28.287 --> 05:32.708
U.S.S. Enterprise,
Captain 's personal log.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.044
With most of our
battle damage repaired,

05:36.128 --> 05:37.754
we're almost home.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.589
we're almost home.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.425
Yet I feel uneasy,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.427
and I wonder why.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.975
Perhaps it is
the emptiness

05:50.058 --> 05:52.936
of this vessel.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.481
Most of our trainee crew
have been reassigned.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.984
Lieutenant Saavik
and my son David

05:59.067 --> 06:00.986
are exploring
the Genesis planet,

06:01.069 --> 06:02.571
which he helped create.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.573
And Enterprise feels
like a house

06:04.615 --> 06:07.451
with all
the children gone.

06:07.618 --> 06:10.579
No. More empty
even than that.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.752
The death of Spock
is like an open wound.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.754
It seems that
I have left

06:18.795 --> 06:20.589
the noblest
part of myself

06:20.631 --> 06:23.467
back there,
on that newborn planet.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.803
Status, Mr. Sulu.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.430
On course, Admiral.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.974
Estimating space dock
in 2.1 hours.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.852
Mr. Chekov, I'll need
a pre-approach scan.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.355
Take the science
station, please.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.856
Yes, sir.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.358
Uhura.

06:39.441 --> 06:43.362
Any response from Starfleet
on our Genesis inquiries?

06:43.445 --> 06:46.156
No, sir. There
is no response.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.991
That's very odd.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.454
Scotty,
progress report.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.830
It's almost done, sir.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.375
You'll be automated
by the time we dock.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.377
Your timing
is excellent.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.379
You fixed
the barn door

07:00.462 --> 07:02.840
after the horse
has come home.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.342
How much refit time
is needed?

07:05.384 --> 07:09.221
Eight weeks, sir,
but I'll do it in two.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.349
Have you always multiplied
your repair estimates

07:12.391 --> 07:14.768
by a factor of four?

07:14.852 --> 07:17.855
How else can I
keep my reputation

07:17.896 --> 07:19.857
as a miracle worker?

07:19.898 --> 07:22.150
Your reputation
is secure, Scotty.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.237
Mr. Sulu,
take the con.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.239
I'll be
in my quarters.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.282
Aye, sir.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.117
Sir?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.618
I was wondering,

07:31.702 --> 07:32.619
are they
planning a ceremony

07:32.703 --> 07:34.621
when we get in?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.164
I mean a reception?

07:36.248 --> 07:40.085
A hero's welcome-
is that what you'd like?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.546
God knows
there should be.

07:42.588 --> 07:46.550
We've paid for the party
with our dearest blood.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.294
Steady.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.795
Steady, boys.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.464
Keep scanning.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.885
I thought you
people were reliable.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.386
Where is he?

08:31.470 --> 08:33.804
He's been here
for some time.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.308
Put me on
hailing frequency.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.269
Commander Kruge.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.105
This is Valkris.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.240
Well done,
Valkris, well done.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
What the hell is-

10:07.983 --> 10:10.402
What the hell's
going on?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.404
When do
I get paid off?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.698
Soon, Captain.
Quite soon.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.442
Approach control,
this is Enterprise,

11:32.484 --> 11:34.319
ready for
docking maneuver.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.655
Enterprise is
cleared to dock.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.656
Lock on.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.161
Systems locked.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.624
Spacedock,
you have control.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.126
Affirmative,
Enterprise.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.587
Enjoy the ride,
and welcome home.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.005
Enterprise confirms.

12:28.832 --> 12:32.169
Would you
look at that.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.379
My friends,

12:34.463 --> 12:36.798
the great experiment...

12:36.882 --> 12:38.967
the Excelsior,

12:39.051 --> 12:41.470
ready for trial runs.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.392
She's supposed to
have transwarp drive.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.395
Aye. And if
my grandmother had wheels,

12:50.479 --> 12:52.397
she'd be a wagon.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.899
Come, come,
Mr. Scott.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.360
Young minds, fresh ideas.
Be tolerant.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.699
Acknowledge
doors are closing.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.889
Stand by, umbilical

13:25.931 --> 13:27.891
and gravitational
support systems.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.853
Moorings activated.
All systems standing by.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.604
Admiral.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.147
This is not possible.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.649
Mr. Chekov?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.569
An energy reading
from "C" deck,

13:38.610 --> 13:41.280
from inside
Mr. Spock's quarters.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.532
I ordered Spock's
quarters sealed.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.076
Yes, sir. I sealed
the room myself.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.620
Nevertheless, I'm reading
a life form there.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.124
This entire crew seems on
the edge of obsessive behavior

13:52.165 --> 13:54.209
concerning Mr. Spock.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.715
Sir, security reports the door
to Spock's quarters

13:59.798 --> 14:01.300
has been forced.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.177
I'm on my way.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.053
Mr. Sulu, continue
docking procedure.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.054
Aye, sir.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.228
Hmm?

14:50.974 --> 14:51.892
Jim...

14:53.268 --> 14:54.686
Help me.

14:59.650 --> 15:03.195
You left me
on Genesis.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.531
Why did
you do that?

15:05.614 --> 15:07.241
Help me.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.997
Bones.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.211
What the hell
are you doing?

15:19.294 --> 15:21.713
Have you
lost your mind?

15:21.797 --> 15:24.049
Help me, Jim.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.551
Take me home.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.053
Bones, we are.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.556
We are home.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.726
Then perhaps
it's not too late.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.895
Climb
the steps, Jim.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.982
Climb the steps
of Mount Seleya.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.443
Mount Seleya?

15:45.153 --> 15:47.614
Bones, Mount Seleya
is on Vulcan.

15:47.698 --> 15:50.075
We're home, on Earth.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.581
Remember.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.250
Admiral,
docking is completed.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.751
Starfleet Commander Morrow

15:59.835 --> 16:01.753
is on his way
for inspection.

16:01.837 --> 16:04.715
Uhura, get
the medics down here!

16:04.756 --> 16:06.758
Get them now!

16:12.431 --> 16:14.391
You've all done
remarkable service

16:14.433 --> 16:16.393
under the most
difficult conditions.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.895
You'll be receiving

16:17.978 --> 16:19.688
Starfleet's
highest commendation,

16:19.771 --> 16:24.234
and more importantly,
extended shore leave.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.737
That is,
all but you, Mr. Scott.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.780
They need your wisdom
on the Excelsior.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.075
Report there tomorrow
as Captain of Engineering.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.577
With all
appreciation, sir,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.913
I'd prefer
to supervise

16:35.954 --> 16:37.414
the refit of
Enterprise.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.043
I'm afraid that
won't be necessary.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.711
But, sir...

16:42.753 --> 16:44.213
I'm sorry, Mr. Scott,

16:44.254 --> 16:46.548
but there
will be no refit.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.091
Admiral.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.593
I don't understand.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.094
The Enterprise is not-

16:51.136 --> 16:54.473
Jim, the Enterprise
is 20 years old.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.434
We feel
her day is over.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.436
But we had
requested...

16:59.478 --> 17:03.148
We'd hoped to take
her back to Genesis.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.858
That is out
of the question.

17:05.943 --> 17:06.984
Why?

17:07.069 --> 17:09.363
In your absence,
Genesis has become

17:09.445 --> 17:11.490
a galactic
controversy.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.371
Until the Federation
Council makes policy,

17:17.454 --> 17:21.083
you're all under orders
not to discuss with anyone

17:21.165 --> 17:23.669
your knowledge
of Genesis.

17:23.752 --> 17:27.548
Consider it
a quarantined planet

17:27.631 --> 17:29.550
and a forbidden subject.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.727
To fully understand
the events I report,

17:40.811 --> 17:42.729
it is necessary
to review

17:42.813 --> 17:45.232
the theoretical data
on the Genesis device

17:45.315 --> 17:48.569
as developed by Doctors
Carol and David Marcus.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.739
Genesis, simply put,
is life from lifelessness.

17:52.823 --> 17:56.243
We intended to introduce
the Genesis device

17:56.326 --> 17:59.246
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body-

17:59.329 --> 18:02.082
a moon or
other dead form.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.042
The device,
when delivered,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.879
would instantaneously
cause the Genesis effect.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.881
Instead of a dead moon,

18:08.922 --> 18:11.383
a living, breathing
planet now exists,

18:11.425 --> 18:13.427
capable of sustaining
whatever life forms

18:13.468 --> 18:16.430
we see fit
to deposit on it.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.488
So?

18:33.572 --> 18:34.656
Speak.

18:36.617 --> 18:40.412
Great power
to control...

18:40.454 --> 18:41.788
dominate.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.124
Speak.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.751
Impressive.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.629
They can make
planets.

18:48.754 --> 18:49.713
Oh, yes.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.216
New cities,
homes in the country,

18:52.299 --> 18:54.009
your woman
at your side,

18:54.092 --> 18:55.761
children playing
at your feet,

18:55.802 --> 18:58.263
and overhead, fluttering
in the breeze,

18:58.347 --> 19:00.224
the flag
of the Federation.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.100
Charming.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.310
Station.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.478
Yes, my lord.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.858
Share this
with no one.

19:09.942 --> 19:13.070
Understood,
my lord.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.364
We are going
to this planet.

19:15.447 --> 19:20.369
Even as our emissaries negotiate
for peace with the Federation,

19:20.452 --> 19:24.873
we will act for the preservation
of our race.

19:24.957 --> 19:28.877
We will seize the secret
of this weapon.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.880
The secret
of ultimate power!

19:31.964 --> 19:33.966
Success, my lord.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.407
We have reached
the destination planet

19:58.448 --> 20:00.909
at .035.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.286
Very well,
Lieutenant.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.747
Helm, execute
standard orbital approach.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.749
Standard orbit.
Aye, sir.

20:07.791 --> 20:08.917
Communications.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.920
Send a coded message
for Starfleet Commander-

20:11.962 --> 20:13.422
priority one.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.424
"Federation science
vessel Grissom

20:15.465 --> 20:19.136
"arriving Genesis planet
to begin research.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.762
J.T. Esteban,
commanding."

20:20.804 --> 20:22.931
Aye, sir.
Coding now.

20:22.973 --> 20:26.101
Dr. Marcus,
it's your planet.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.061
Begin scanning,
please.

20:30.689 --> 20:34.151
This is where
the fun begins, Saavik.

20:34.193 --> 20:37.154
Just like your father-
so human.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.655
All units functional.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.157
Recorders are on.

20:40.199 --> 20:41.450
Scanning Sector 1 .

20:42.618 --> 20:45.120
Foliage in fully-developed
state of growth.

20:45.204 --> 20:49.041
Temperature-22.2 Celsius.

20:49.124 --> 20:52.127
Sector 2 indicating
desert terrain.

20:52.211 --> 20:53.670
Minimal vegetation.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.299
Temperature-39.4.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.636
Sector 3-
subtropical vegetation.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.680
Temperature
decreasing rapidly.

21:06.517 --> 21:07.935
It's snow.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.895
Snow in
the same sector.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.522
Fantastic.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.773
Fascinating.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.901
All the varieties
of Earth's land and weather

21:15.984 --> 21:18.028
within
a few hours' walk.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.613
Metallic mass.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.241
Close-range scan.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.869
A photon tube.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.121
Gravitational fields
were in flux.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.582
It must have
soft-landed.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.501
In code to Starfleet-

21:32.584 --> 21:35.462
"Captain Spock's tube
located on Genesis' surface."

21:35.546 --> 21:37.548
Yes, sir.
Coding your message.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.346
I don't believe it.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.641
What is it?

21:47.724 --> 21:50.477
If equipment
is functioning properly,

21:50.561 --> 21:53.272
indications are
an animal life form.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.608
You said there
wouldn't be any.

21:56.650 --> 21:57.860
There shouldn't be any.

21:57.943 --> 21:59.903
Cross-referenced
and verified.

21:59.987 --> 22:02.865
An unidentifiable
life form reading.

22:02.948 --> 22:04.283
Shall we advise Starfleet?

22:04.366 --> 22:05.951
Wait a minute.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.954
We don't know what
we're talking about here.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.330
Let's
beam it up.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.373
No, you don't.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.875
Regulations
specifically state

22:12.958 --> 22:14.543
nothing shall
be beamed aboard

22:14.626 --> 22:17.504
until danger of contamination
has been eliminated.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.048
The logical alternative
is obvious.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.050
Beaming down
is permitted.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.678
If the Captain
decides the mission

22:24.761 --> 22:27.222
is vital and reasonably
free of danger.

22:27.306 --> 22:30.559
Captain, please, we've got to
find out what it is.

22:30.642 --> 22:31.977
Or who.

22:37.191 --> 22:38.734
Absent friends.

22:40.652 --> 22:44.072
Admiral, what will happen
to the Enterprise?

22:44.156 --> 22:46.074
She's to be
decommissioned.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.076
Will we get
another ship?

22:48.160 --> 22:50.078
I can't get
an answer.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.581
Starfleet is
up to its brass

22:52.664 --> 22:54.082
in a galactic
conference.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.085
No one has time
for those who wait.

22:57.169 --> 22:59.755
Sir, about
Dr. McCoy...

22:59.838 --> 23:01.590
how is he?

23:01.673 --> 23:03.550
He's home,
resting comfortably.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.552
Pumped full
of tranquilizers.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.554
They say
it's exhaustion.

23:07.596 --> 23:10.057
He promised me he'd stay put.
We'll see.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.893
Ah, Mr. Scott.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.228
Come.

23:25.656 --> 23:26.740
Sarek!

23:30.327 --> 23:33.247
Ambassador, I had no idea
you were here.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.831
You know my crew.

23:36.124 --> 23:39.837
I will speak
with you alone, Kirk.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.589
Please excuse us.

23:45.759 --> 23:49.096
Ambassador, I would
have come to Vulcan

23:49.137 --> 23:51.014
to express
my deepest sympathies.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.475
Spare me your
human platitudes.

23:53.559 --> 23:55.477
I have been
to your government.

23:55.561 --> 23:58.480
I've seen the Genesis
information and your own report.

23:58.564 --> 24:01.483
Then you know your son
met his death bravely.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.986
Why did you leave
him on Genesis?

24:04.027 --> 24:05.571
Spock trusted you,

24:05.654 --> 24:09.533
and you denied him
his future.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.451
I saw no future.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.162
Only his body
was in death.

24:14.246 --> 24:17.207
You were the last
one to be with him.

24:17.249 --> 24:18.542
Yes, I was.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.170
You should have come
with him to Vulcan.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.379
But why?

24:22.462 --> 24:25.549
Because
he asked you to.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.302
He entrusted you

24:28.385 --> 24:30.888
with his
very essence,

24:30.971 --> 24:33.056
with everything
that was not of the body.

24:33.140 --> 24:36.226
He asked you
to bring him to us

24:36.310 --> 24:39.062
and to bring that
which he gave you-

24:39.146 --> 24:43.817
his Katra-
his living spirit.

24:43.901 --> 24:47.070
Sir...

24:47.112 --> 24:52.117
your son meant more to me
than you can know.

24:52.201 --> 24:55.913
I'd have given my life
if it would have saved his.

24:55.954 --> 24:59.166
Believe me, he made
no request of me.

24:59.249 --> 25:01.835
He would not have
spoken of it openly.

25:01.919 --> 25:03.670
Then how...

25:03.754 --> 25:06.548
Kirk, I must
have your thoughts.

25:06.632 --> 25:09.301
May I join your mind?

25:12.304 --> 25:13.430
Certainly.

25:33.659 --> 25:36.036
He spoke
of your friendship.

25:37.496 --> 25:38.830
Yes.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.586
Asked you
not to grieve.

25:46.505 --> 25:47.589
Yes.

25:49.174 --> 25:52.261
The needs
of the many...

25:54.179 --> 25:55.639
outweigh...

25:58.016 --> 26:00.352
the needs
of the few.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.479
Or the one.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.401
Spock.

26:09.027 --> 26:11.947
I have been...

26:12.030 --> 26:14.867
and always
shall be...

26:14.950 --> 26:17.202
your friend.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.873
Live long...

26:20.956 --> 26:22.541
and prosper.

26:24.126 --> 26:25.586
No.

26:39.725 --> 26:40.684
Forgive me.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.605
It is not here.

26:46.648 --> 26:50.110
I had assumed
he mind-melded with you.

26:50.152 --> 26:52.613
It is
the Vulcan way

26:52.654 --> 26:55.741
when the body's
end is near.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.284
We were separate.

26:59.161 --> 27:01.121
He couldn't touch me.

27:01.163 --> 27:02.706
I see.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.505
Then everything
that he was...

27:11.548 --> 27:13.509
everything
he knew...

27:15.552 --> 27:17.054
is lost.

27:27.189 --> 27:28.857
Please wait.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.529
He would have
found a way.

27:33.612 --> 27:36.532
If there was
that much at stake,

27:36.615 --> 27:38.617
Spock would have
found a way.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.370
Yes. But how?

27:41.453 --> 27:45.207
What if he joined
with someone else?

27:48.627 --> 27:51.088
Engine room,
flight recorder visual.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.882
Stardate 8128. 78.

27:53.966 --> 27:55.050
Go.

27:56.635 --> 27:58.053
The ship...

27:58.136 --> 28:00.389
out of danger?

28:01.598 --> 28:03.517
Yes.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.811
Back .77.

28:07.145 --> 28:10.482
Flight recorder
visual 28. 77.

28:10.524 --> 28:11.692
Go.

28:11.775 --> 28:14.194
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

28:14.278 --> 28:15.195
He'll die.

28:15.279 --> 28:17.406
He's dead already.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.491
Back .76.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.124
Flight recorder
visual 28. 76.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.250
Go.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.503
You're not
going in there.

28:31.587 --> 28:33.005
Perhaps you're right.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.507
What is Mr. Scott's
condition?

28:35.591 --> 28:37.009
I don't think he-

28:37.092 --> 28:38.510
Sorry, Doctor,

28:38.594 --> 28:41.054
I have no time
to discuss this logically.

28:43.599 --> 28:46.310
Freeze.

28:46.393 --> 28:48.520
Repeat and augment.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.941
Remember.

28:57.112 --> 28:58.363
McCoy!

28:58.447 --> 29:00.532
One alive, one not,

29:00.616 --> 29:02.910
yet both in pain.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.995
What must I do?

29:05.078 --> 29:09.041
You must bring them
to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.544
Only there
can both find peace.

29:12.586 --> 29:14.505
What you ask...

29:16.590 --> 29:18.592
is difficult.

29:18.675 --> 29:21.845
You will
find a way, Kirk.

29:24.598 --> 29:27.017
If you
honor them both,

29:27.100 --> 29:28.685
you must.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.022
I will.

29:33.607 --> 29:35.025
I swear.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.534
Transporter room,
stand by to energize.

29:43.617 --> 29:45.994
Aye, sir.
Energizing now.

30:02.469 --> 30:03.887
Grissom to Saavik.

30:03.971 --> 30:07.224
We're picking up radiation
from the life form.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.559
Affirmative,
Captain.

30:08.642 --> 30:11.061
Our readings are well below
danger level.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.563
Exercise caution,
Lieutenant.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.565
This landing
is Captain's discretion,

30:14.648 --> 30:17.651
and I'm the one
who's out on a limb.

30:17.693 --> 30:19.987
I'll try
to remember that.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.588
There are your
life forms.

30:37.671 --> 30:41.091
These were microbes
on the tube's surface.

30:41.175 --> 30:44.094
We shot them here
from Enterprise.

30:44.178 --> 30:46.597
They were fruitful
and multiplied.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.600
But how could they have
evolved so quickly?

31:02.446 --> 31:03.739
Saavik.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.585
What is it?

31:16.627 --> 31:18.754
Spock's burial robe.

31:24.635 --> 31:28.263
Aaahhh...

31:29.640 --> 31:33.685
Aaahhh...

31:35.646 --> 31:37.272
No. Absolutely not,
Jim.

31:37.356 --> 31:38.732
You're
my best officer,

31:38.815 --> 31:40.609
but I am Commander-
Starfleet,

31:40.651 --> 31:42.611
so I don't
break rules.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.112
Don't quote rules.

31:44.196 --> 31:47.115
I'm talking about
loyalty and sacrifice.

31:47.199 --> 31:49.952
One man
who's died for us,

31:50.035 --> 31:51.828
another with
emotional problems.

31:51.912 --> 31:54.957
This business about
Spock and McCoy-

31:55.040 --> 31:57.918
honestly, I never understood
Vulcan mysticism.

31:58.001 --> 32:00.504
You don't
have to believe.

32:00.587 --> 32:03.632
I'm not even sure
that I believe.

32:03.715 --> 32:06.051
But if there's
even a chance

32:06.134 --> 32:08.387
that Spock has
an eternal soul,

32:08.470 --> 32:10.180
then it's
my responsibility.

32:10.222 --> 32:11.723
Yours?

32:11.765 --> 32:16.562
As surely as if
it were my very own.

32:18.230 --> 32:20.065
Give me back
the Enterprise.

32:20.107 --> 32:22.067
With Scotty's help-

32:22.150 --> 32:24.570
No. The Enterprise would never
stand the pounding.

32:24.653 --> 32:27.573
Then I'll find a ship.
I'll hire a ship.

32:27.656 --> 32:29.074
Out of the question.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.576
The council
has ordered

32:30.659 --> 32:33.453
that no one
but the science team

32:33.537 --> 32:34.830
goes to Genesis.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.374
Jim, your life
and your career

32:37.457 --> 32:38.876
stand
for rationality,

32:38.959 --> 32:41.128
not for
intellectual chaos.

32:41.211 --> 32:43.088
Keep up this
emotional behavior,

32:43.172 --> 32:44.590
and you'll lose
everything.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.633
You'll destroy
yourself.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.719
Do you
understand me, Jim?

32:50.846 --> 32:52.264
I hear you.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.601
I had to try.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.603
Of course.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.229
Thanks for the drink.

32:59.313 --> 33:00.606
Anytime.

33:07.321 --> 33:08.780
The word, sir?

33:08.822 --> 33:11.074
The word is no.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.076
I am therefore
going anyway.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.078
You can
count on our help.

33:15.162 --> 33:16.580
Thank you.
I'll need it.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.081
Shall I alert
Dr. McCoy?

33:18.165 --> 33:20.792
Please. He has a long
journey ahead of him.

33:44.191 --> 33:46.109
Long time, Doc.

33:46.193 --> 33:49.530
Yeah. Anybody been
looking for me?

33:49.613 --> 33:52.324
I have.
What will it be?

33:52.407 --> 33:54.076
Altair water.

33:54.159 --> 33:56.328
That's not your
usual poison.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.959
To expect one to order
poison in a bar

34:02.042 --> 34:03.418
is not logical.

34:03.502 --> 34:05.587
Got it.

34:16.098 --> 34:18.559
To your planet,
welcome.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.938
I think that's
my line, stranger.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.565
Oh, forgive.

34:25.649 --> 34:27.734
I here am new.

34:27.818 --> 34:29.902
But you are known,

34:29.987 --> 34:33.197
being McCoy
from Enterprise.

34:34.658 --> 34:37.578
You have me
at a disadvantage, sir.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.580
I name
not important.

34:39.663 --> 34:41.415
You seek l.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.750
Message received.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.795
Available ship
stands by.

34:46.879 --> 34:50.174
How much and how soon?

34:50.257 --> 34:52.259
How soon is now.

34:52.342 --> 34:55.094
How much is where.

34:56.179 --> 34:59.099
Somewhere in
the Mutara sector.

34:59.183 --> 35:01.935
Oh...
Mutara restricted.

35:02.019 --> 35:04.021
Take permits many.

35:04.104 --> 35:06.273
Money more.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.526
There aren't going
to be any damn permits.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.528
How can you get a permit

35:11.612 --> 35:13.530
to do a damn
illegal thing?

35:13.614 --> 35:15.866
Look, price you name.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.284
Money I got.

35:17.367 --> 35:18.869
Place you name.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.537
Money I name.

35:20.621 --> 35:23.165
Otherwise,
bargain no.

35:23.248 --> 35:25.167
All right, damn it.
It's Genesis.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.670
The name of the place
we're going is Genesis!

35:28.754 --> 35:30.214
Genesis?

35:30.255 --> 35:31.548
Yes, Genesis!

35:31.590 --> 35:35.219
How can you be deaf
with ears like that?

35:35.302 --> 35:37.554
Genesis allowed
is not.

35:37.638 --> 35:39.848
Is planet forbidden.

35:39.932 --> 35:41.558
Look,
my backwards friend,

35:41.642 --> 35:43.602
Genesis may be
planet forbidden,

35:43.644 --> 35:45.103
but I'm damn well-

35:47.147 --> 35:49.816
Sir, your voice
is carrying.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.569
You don't want to discuss
this subject in public.

35:52.653 --> 35:54.613
I'll discuss
what I like!

35:54.655 --> 35:56.615
Who the hell
are you?

35:56.657 --> 35:59.618
Could I offer you
a ride home, Dr. McCoy?

35:59.660 --> 36:02.538
Where's the logic?
lf I wanted a ride home,

36:02.621 --> 36:06.166
would I be chartering
a space flight?

36:07.459 --> 36:09.586
How do you know
who I am?

36:09.670 --> 36:11.964
Federation
security, sir.

36:19.137 --> 36:22.683
You're going to get
a nice long rest, Doctor.

36:45.539 --> 36:47.082
Saavik to Grissom.

36:47.165 --> 36:50.252
We are definitely reading
a second life form.

36:50.335 --> 36:51.587
We concur.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.589
Proceed with
caution, Saavik.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.010
What the hell
is going on down there?

36:59.178 --> 37:00.596
Make it quick,
Admiral.

37:00.679 --> 37:04.057
They're moving him
to the Federation funny farm.

37:04.099 --> 37:05.559
Poor friend.

37:05.601 --> 37:08.061
I hear he's fruity
as a nutcake.

37:08.103 --> 37:09.062
Two minutes.

37:15.277 --> 37:16.737
Jim!

37:16.778 --> 37:19.031
How many fingers
do I have up?

37:19.072 --> 37:21.074
That's not very funny.

37:21.158 --> 37:23.118
You're sense
of humor's returned.

37:23.202 --> 37:25.454
The hell it has.
What's that?

37:25.537 --> 37:26.455
Lexorin.

37:26.538 --> 37:28.665
Lexorin? What for?

37:28.749 --> 37:32.336
You're suffering from a Vulcan
mind-meld, Doctor.

37:32.419 --> 37:35.297
That green-blooded
son of a bitch!

37:35.380 --> 37:39.343
It's his revenge for
those arguments he lost.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.094
Let's see your hand.

37:41.136 --> 37:44.723
This will make you
well enough to travel.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.311
Where's Admiral Kirk?

37:49.394 --> 37:50.812
He's with
the prisoner.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.314
Get him quickly.

37:52.397 --> 37:54.816
Commander Starfleet
wants him right away.

37:57.903 --> 37:59.821
Oh, hum.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.406
Keeping you busy?

38:08.163 --> 38:10.499
Don't get smart, Tiny.

38:10.541 --> 38:11.959
Admiral, Starfleet-

38:12.000 --> 38:14.461
This man's sick.
Take a look.

38:18.006 --> 38:19.466
Side elevator.

38:19.508 --> 38:20.968
Agents coming up.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.312
Don't call me Tiny.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.317
The Kobayashi Maru

38:37.401 --> 38:40.487
has set sail
for the promised land.

38:40.571 --> 38:41.947
Acknowledge.

38:42.030 --> 38:45.325
Message acknowledged.
All units will be informed.

38:45.409 --> 38:48.579
You're taking me to
the promised land?

38:48.662 --> 38:50.122
What are friends for?

38:58.422 --> 39:01.258
Ah, Mr. Scott.
Calling it a night?

39:01.300 --> 39:02.634
Uh, yes, sir.

39:02.718 --> 39:06.763
Looking forward to breaking
some speed records tomorrow.

39:06.847 --> 39:08.682
Yes, sir.
Good night.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.268
Level, please.

39:11.351 --> 39:12.769
Transporter room.

39:12.853 --> 39:13.937
Thank you.

39:14.021 --> 39:15.439
Up your shaft.

39:17.191 --> 39:21.278
Roger. Old City Station
at 2200 hours. All is well.

39:21.361 --> 39:23.280
Understood.
All stations clear.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.282
You amaze me,
Commander.

39:25.365 --> 39:26.783
How is that?

39:26.867 --> 39:28.535
A 20-year space veteran,

39:28.619 --> 39:31.955
yet you choose
the worst duty station.

39:32.039 --> 39:35.459
This is
the hind end of space.

39:35.542 --> 39:38.253
Peace and quiet
appeals to me, Lieutenant.

39:38.337 --> 39:40.756
Maybe that's okay
for someone like you,

39:40.839 --> 39:43.425
whose career
is winding down.

39:43.509 --> 39:47.429
But me, I need some challenge
and adventure in my life.

39:47.513 --> 39:49.848
Maybe even
just a surprise.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.351
You know
what they say.

39:52.392 --> 39:54.353
Be careful
what you wish for.

39:54.394 --> 39:55.854
You may get it.

39:57.856 --> 40:00.817
Good evening, Commander.
Is everything ready?

40:00.901 --> 40:04.321
Step into my parlor,
gentlemen.

40:04.363 --> 40:06.365
That's Admiral Kirk.
My God!

40:06.406 --> 40:08.367
Very good for you,
Lieutenant.

40:08.408 --> 40:10.369
But it's damn irregular.

40:10.410 --> 40:13.372
No destination orders,
no encoded IDs.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.373
All true.

40:14.414 --> 40:15.874
What'll we do?

40:15.916 --> 40:17.876
I'm not doing anything.

40:17.918 --> 40:20.796
You're going to sit
in the closet.

40:20.879 --> 40:21.922
The closet?

40:22.005 --> 40:23.882
Have you lost
all your sense of reality?

40:23.924 --> 40:26.051
This isn't reality.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.179
This is fantasy.

40:29.263 --> 40:31.557
You wanted adventure.
How's this?

40:31.598 --> 40:33.308
The old
adrenaline going?

40:33.392 --> 40:35.477
Good. Now get
in the closet.

40:35.561 --> 40:37.437
Okay.

40:37.521 --> 40:38.897
Uh...

40:38.939 --> 40:40.399
Go on. Go on.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.860
I'll just get
in the closet.

40:42.943 --> 40:43.902
Okay!

40:47.072 --> 40:49.783
I'm glad
you're on our side.

40:49.867 --> 40:52.786
I'll have Mr. Adventure
eating out of my hand,

40:52.870 --> 40:55.789
and I'll see you
at the rendezvous.

40:55.831 --> 40:57.249
Oh, and, Admiral...

40:58.959 --> 41:00.586
All my hopes.

41:18.395 --> 41:21.315
As promised,
she's all yours, sir.

41:21.398 --> 41:23.817
All systems
automated and ready.

41:23.901 --> 41:26.987
A chimpanzee
and two trainees could run her.

41:27.070 --> 41:30.407
I'll try not
to take that personally.

41:31.658 --> 41:36.121
My friends, I can't ask
you to go any further.

41:36.205 --> 41:38.624
Dr. McCoy and I
have to do this.

41:38.707 --> 41:40.626
The rest of you do not.

41:40.709 --> 41:43.962
Admiral, we're losing
precious time.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.672
What course,
please, Admiral?

41:47.090 --> 41:48.592
Mr. Scott?

41:48.634 --> 41:51.678
I'd be grateful
if you'd give the word.

41:54.932 --> 41:56.350
Gentlemen...

41:56.433 --> 41:59.603
May the wind
be at our backs.

41:59.686 --> 42:00.646
Stations, please.

42:03.357 --> 42:05.317
Engage all the systems.

42:05.359 --> 42:06.818
Aye. Engaged!

42:06.860 --> 42:08.654
Clear all moorings.

42:08.695 --> 42:09.780
Clearing, sir.

42:09.863 --> 42:11.782
One quarter
impulse power.

42:11.823 --> 42:13.825
One quarter impulse.

42:27.422 --> 42:28.423
Sir.

42:28.507 --> 42:30.425
Commander Starfleet
orders you

42:30.509 --> 42:32.886
to surrender this vessel.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.346
No reply, Chekov.

42:34.388 --> 42:36.431
Steady as she goes.

42:42.229 --> 42:44.690
Yellow alert.
Captain to the bridge.

42:44.731 --> 42:45.732
Yellow alert.

42:47.401 --> 42:50.320
How can you have
a yellow alert in spacedock?

42:50.404 --> 42:54.366
Sir, someone is stealing
the Enterprise!

42:56.410 --> 42:57.870
I'm on my way.

42:58.996 --> 43:00.372
Alert. Yellow alert.

43:00.414 --> 43:02.791
All stations,
yellow alert.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.793
Alert. Yellow alert.

43:04.877 --> 43:06.670
All stations,
yellow alert.

43:10.591 --> 43:13.093
One minute to space doors.

43:13.135 --> 43:15.804
Are you just going
to walk through?

43:15.888 --> 43:17.514
Calm yourself, Doctor.

43:24.730 --> 43:28.775
Sir, Excelsior powering up
with orders to pursue.

43:28.859 --> 43:30.319
Yellow alert.

43:31.403 --> 43:32.654
Status?

43:32.738 --> 43:35.407
All automates ready
and functioning.

43:35.490 --> 43:36.825
Automatic moorings
retracted.

43:36.909 --> 43:38.327
All speeds available

43:38.410 --> 43:39.828
through
transwarp drive.

43:39.912 --> 43:41.330
Incredible machine.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.291
Helm.

43:46.335 --> 43:48.295
One quarter
impulse power.

43:53.842 --> 43:57.095
30 seconds
to space doors.

43:57.179 --> 43:59.181
Warning.
Secure space doors.

44:00.432 --> 44:03.101
Warning.
Secure space doors.

44:03.185 --> 44:06.230
And...now,
Mr. Scott.

44:06.313 --> 44:07.523
Sir?

44:07.606 --> 44:09.066
The doors,
Mr. Scott.

44:09.149 --> 44:11.401
Aye, sir.
I'm working on it.

44:14.363 --> 44:17.366
Danger.
Space doors are closed.

44:17.407 --> 44:22.079
Danger.
Space doors are closed.

44:46.603 --> 44:48.856
We have cleared
space doors.

45:02.452 --> 45:03.954
Full impulse power.

45:04.037 --> 45:05.289
Aye, sir.

45:13.463 --> 45:14.798
Standby tractor beam.

45:14.882 --> 45:16.300
Tractor beam, aye.

45:16.383 --> 45:20.095
If he tries to get away
with warp drive,

45:20.137 --> 45:22.848
he's really in
for a shock.

45:36.570 --> 45:38.739
Excelsior closing
to 4,000 meters.

45:38.822 --> 45:40.449
We'll need everything
you have.

45:40.532 --> 45:42.910
Aye, sir.
Warp drive standing by.

45:44.912 --> 45:46.538
Kirk, if you do this,

45:46.622 --> 45:50.375
you'll never sit in
the captain's chair again.

45:50.459 --> 45:52.169
Warp speed.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.505
Aye, sir.

45:54.588 --> 45:56.381
Warp speed.

45:59.510 --> 46:01.345
Prepare for warp speed.

46:01.428 --> 46:03.096
Standby transwarp drive.

46:07.392 --> 46:09.394
Transwarp
at your command.

46:09.478 --> 46:10.562
Full power available.

46:10.646 --> 46:11.563
Execute.

46:18.904 --> 46:20.322
...Power available...

46:23.742 --> 46:26.578
Transwarp drive,
full...power... available....

46:36.421 --> 46:37.840
Transwarp drive,

46:37.923 --> 46:42.845
maximum velocity
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

46:51.061 --> 46:53.856
Scotty, as good
as your word.

46:53.939 --> 46:56.358
The more they over think
the plumbing,

46:56.441 --> 46:59.361
the easier it is
to stop up the drain.

46:59.444 --> 47:01.864
Here, Doctor, souvenirs
from one surgeon to another.

47:01.947 --> 47:05.909
I removed them from her
transwarp computer drive.

47:05.993 --> 47:09.329
Nice of you
to tell me in advance.

47:09.371 --> 47:11.832
You shouldn't miss
staff meetings.

47:11.874 --> 47:13.834
Your work today
has been outstanding.

47:13.876 --> 47:16.336
I'll recommend you all
for promotion...

47:16.378 --> 47:19.339
in whatever fleet
we end up serving.

47:19.381 --> 47:21.175
Best speed to Genesis.

48:38.001 --> 48:39.795
The Genesis wave.

48:39.878 --> 48:42.840
His cells could have
been regenerated.

48:46.385 --> 48:48.303
Captain,
this is Saavik.

48:48.387 --> 48:49.721
Come in, please.

48:49.805 --> 48:51.306
Yes, Saavik.
Go ahead.

48:51.390 --> 48:54.309
We have found
the life sign.

48:54.393 --> 48:56.061
It is a Vulcan child,

48:56.144 --> 48:58.480
perhaps 8-1 0 Earth
years of age.

48:58.564 --> 49:00.649
A child?
How did he get there?

49:00.732 --> 49:04.736
It's Dr. Marcus' opinion
that this is...

49:06.405 --> 49:09.741
that the Genesis effect
has regenerated...

49:09.825 --> 49:11.368
Captain Spock.

49:16.164 --> 49:17.749
Uh...

49:17.833 --> 49:19.793
Saavik, that's, uh...

49:19.835 --> 49:21.295
That's extraordinary.

49:21.336 --> 49:23.547
What will you do next?

49:23.630 --> 49:26.466
Request permission
to beam aboard immediately.

49:26.550 --> 49:29.761
Does Dr. Marcus think
there's any chance

49:29.845 --> 49:31.763
of radioactive
contamination?

49:31.805 --> 49:33.307
No.

49:33.348 --> 49:35.309
None that he can detect.

49:35.350 --> 49:38.645
I'll advise Starfleet
and get instructions.

49:38.687 --> 49:41.148
I'm sure Starfleet
would approve.

49:41.190 --> 49:44.401
Probably true,
but let's follow rules.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.737
Stand by
on this channel.

49:46.820 --> 49:47.946
Go.

49:48.030 --> 49:50.824
Starfleet Command,
this is U.S.S. Grissom

49:50.866 --> 49:52.826
on subspace
coded channel 98.8.

49:52.868 --> 49:54.661
Come in, please.

50:00.709 --> 50:02.669
Something is jamming
our transmission.

50:02.711 --> 50:04.213
An energy surge.

50:04.296 --> 50:05.339
Locate.

50:08.884 --> 50:10.677
It's from astern,
Captain.

50:14.681 --> 50:16.391
Oh, my God!

50:26.527 --> 50:28.695
Captain,
what is happening?

50:28.737 --> 50:30.239
We're under attack!

50:30.322 --> 50:31.865
Stand by for evasive.

50:31.907 --> 50:32.866
Bah!

50:53.971 --> 50:55.138
May I suggest-

50:55.222 --> 50:57.266
Say the wrong thing!

50:57.349 --> 50:59.935
If you
want prisoners,

51:00.018 --> 51:01.895
there are
life signs there.

51:01.979 --> 51:04.231
Perhaps the very
scientists you seek.

51:04.273 --> 51:05.816
Very good.

51:05.899 --> 51:07.818
Grissom,
this is Saavik

51:07.901 --> 51:09.319
on emergency frequency.

51:09.403 --> 51:10.821
Come in, please.

51:14.157 --> 51:15.909
What happened
to them?

51:15.993 --> 51:19.788
Grissom was destroyed
by an enemy attack.

51:21.331 --> 51:22.833
We must go.

51:22.916 --> 51:25.335
They will soon
come after us.

51:30.757 --> 51:33.844
Estimating Genesis,
2.9 hours, present speed.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.846
Can we hold speed?

51:35.929 --> 51:38.849
Aye. She's got
her second wind.

51:38.932 --> 51:41.351
Scan for vessels
in pursuit.

51:41.435 --> 51:44.354
Scanning.
Indications negative at this time.

51:49.193 --> 51:52.237
Well, did I
get it right?

51:52.321 --> 51:55.324
Great, Bones,
just great.

52:26.146 --> 52:30.025
It's time for total
truth between us.

52:30.108 --> 52:33.028
This planet is not
what you intended

52:33.111 --> 52:35.280
or hoped for, is it?

52:35.364 --> 52:38.200
Not exactly.

52:38.283 --> 52:40.118
Why?

52:40.202 --> 52:44.623
I used protomatter
in the Genesis matrix.

52:44.706 --> 52:45.874
Protomatter.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.376
An unstable substance

52:47.459 --> 52:49.878
which every ethical scientist
in the galaxy

52:49.962 --> 52:52.297
has denounced as
dangerously unpredictable.

52:52.339 --> 52:55.634
It was the only way
to solve certain problems.

52:55.676 --> 53:00.389
So, like your father,
you changed the rules.

53:00.472 --> 53:01.890
If I hadn't,

53:01.974 --> 53:05.310
it might have
been years or never.

53:05.394 --> 53:08.939
How many have paid the price
for your impatience?

53:09.022 --> 53:11.066
How many have died?

53:11.149 --> 53:13.944
How much damage
have you done?

53:14.027 --> 53:15.821
And what is
yet to come?

55:09.643 --> 55:11.603
This planet's aging
in surges.

55:11.687 --> 55:13.480
And Spock with it.

55:13.564 --> 55:15.482
It seems
they' rejoined together.

55:15.566 --> 55:16.733
They are.

55:16.817 --> 55:19.069
How long?

55:19.111 --> 55:20.821
Days...

55:22.072 --> 55:23.615
maybe hours.

55:26.410 --> 55:27.703
I'm sorry.

55:31.915 --> 55:34.209
It will be
hardest on Spock.

55:34.293 --> 55:39.339
Soon he will feel the burning
of his Vulcan blood.

55:39.423 --> 55:40.591
I don't understand.

55:40.674 --> 55:42.092
Pon Farr.

55:42.176 --> 55:44.595
Vulcan males
must endure it

55:44.678 --> 55:47.931
every seventh year
of their adult life.

55:55.731 --> 55:57.816
Whoever they are,
they're getting closer.

55:57.858 --> 55:58.817
I'll go.

55:58.859 --> 56:00.569
No.

56:00.652 --> 56:02.237
I'll do it.

56:02.321 --> 56:04.489
Give me
your phaser.

56:12.539 --> 56:15.250
Sir, Starfleet
calling U.S.S. Grissom.

56:15.334 --> 56:17.336
A warning about us.

56:17.419 --> 56:18.504
Response?

56:19.838 --> 56:22.007
Nothing, as before.

56:23.842 --> 56:26.261
What's the Grissom
up to?

56:26.345 --> 56:29.264
Will she join us
or fire on us?

56:29.348 --> 56:33.477
Break silence. Send
Captain Esteban my compliments.

56:33.560 --> 56:34.853
Aye, sir.

56:38.732 --> 56:40.150
How are we doing?

56:40.234 --> 56:41.652
How are we doing?

56:41.735 --> 56:45.656
It's funny you should
put it quite that way, Jim.

56:45.739 --> 56:47.157
We are doing fine,

56:47.241 --> 56:50.744
but I'd feel safer giving him
one of my kidneys

56:50.827 --> 56:53.205
than what's scrambled
in my brain.

56:53.288 --> 56:56.708
Admiral, there's no response
from Grissom on any channel.

56:59.127 --> 57:00.546
Keep trying, Chekov...

57:00.629 --> 57:02.172
at regular intervals.

57:35.789 --> 57:38.709
It is called Pon Farr.

57:40.919 --> 57:42.880
Pon Farr.

59:00.541 --> 59:03.502
We are secured
for warp speed.

59:03.544 --> 59:05.128
Now entering
Genesis sector.

59:05.212 --> 59:07.464
Proceed at impulse power.

59:19.101 --> 59:22.020
Vessel entering
sector.

59:22.104 --> 59:25.649
Yes. Federation
battle cruiser.

59:25.732 --> 59:27.192
Have they scanned us?

59:27.234 --> 59:29.027
Not yet.

59:29.069 --> 59:30.404
Ahh.

59:56.555 --> 59:59.474
I'd swear there
was something there, sir.

59:59.558 --> 01:00:02.060
What did you see?

01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:07.107
For an instant,
a scout-class vessel.

01:00:07.149 --> 01:00:08.817
Could be Grissom.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:10.903
Patch in
a hailing frequency.

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:17.576
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:19.494
Please come in.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:27.586
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:29.087
Do you read?

01:00:29.129 --> 01:00:30.631
Yiahuq!

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:31.924
Spock!

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:42.893
Dah!

01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:47.189
I've come a long way
for the power of Genesis,

01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:50.692
and what do I find?

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.778
A weakling human,

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:54.321
a Vulcan boy,

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:55.989
and a woman.

01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:59.201
My lord, we are survivors
of a doomed expedition.

01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:02.204
This planet will
destroy itself in hours.

01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:04.164
The Genesis experiment
is a failure.

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:05.541
A failure.

01:01:05.624 --> 01:01:11.046
The most powerful destructive
force ever created.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:21.473
You will tell me the secret
of the Genesis torpedo.

01:01:21.557 --> 01:01:23.517
I have no knowledge.

01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:28.272
Then I hope pain is
something you enjoy.

01:01:30.148 --> 01:01:31.108
Johwi'.

01:01:33.485 --> 01:01:34.903
I ordered
no interruptions!

01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:37.489
But, sir, Federation
starship approaching.

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:39.324
Bring me up.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.993
Grissom...

01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:42.995
this is Enterprise
calling.

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:44.496
Do you read?

01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:49.001
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling.

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:50.669
Please come in.

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.217
Grissom.

01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:59.219
This is Admiral Kirk

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:02.222
calling Captain Esteban
or Lieutenant Saavik.

01:02:02.306 --> 01:02:03.724
Please come in.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.225
Report status.

01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:06.727
We are cloaked.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.229
Enemy closing
on impulse power.

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:10.731
Range,
5,000 kellicams.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.024
Good.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:16.111
This is the turn of luck
I've been waiting for.

01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:25.245
Nothing
on my scanner.

01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:27.831
Short range scan,
Mr. Chekov.

01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:30.792
Put it on visual,
Mr. Sulu.

01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:38.383
Range, 3,000 kellicams.

01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:40.427
Steady.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:43.639
Continue on
impulse power.

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:49.353
Range, 2,000 kellicams.

01:02:50.646 --> 01:02:54.274
Stand by to transfer
energy to weapons...

01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:58.111
at my command.

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:07.454
There.

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:10.832
That distortion.
See it?

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:13.794
It's enlarging
as we close in.

01:03:13.836 --> 01:03:15.963
Firing range, sir.

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:34.523
Opinion, Mr. Sulu.

01:03:34.606 --> 01:03:36.900
It's an
energy surge.

01:03:36.984 --> 01:03:38.402
Enough to hide
a ship?

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:39.736
A cloaking device.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.281
Red alert,
Mr. Scott.

01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:44.199
Aye, sir.

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:47.327
1 ,000 kellicams,
closing.

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.538
Power to
weapons systems.

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:51.081
Wait.

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:53.166
Wait.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.918
No shields?

01:03:55.002 --> 01:03:56.587
My guess is right.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.006
They have to decloak
before firing.

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:01.717
May all your
guesses be right.

01:04:01.758 --> 01:04:04.386
Vaq valis qeliqap.

01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:07.055
Tyrusch.

01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:08.599
Shoha!

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:16.940
Klingon bird of prey, sir.
She's arming torpedoes.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.066
Fire!

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.411
Good shooting, Mr. Scott.

01:04:33.207 --> 01:04:34.833
Precautionary,
Mr. Chekov.

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.376
Shields up.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.836
Aye, sir.

01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:45.344
Emergency power

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:47.804
to the thrusters!

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:52.601
Sir, the shield's
nonresponsive.

01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:54.061
Scotty?

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:55.812
The automation system's
overloaded.

01:04:55.854 --> 01:04:58.649
I didn't expect
to go into combat.

01:05:00.943 --> 01:05:02.402
Bah!

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:15.249
Emergency power.

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:17.334
Prepare to return fire.

01:05:17.376 --> 01:05:21.922
Can you transfer power
to the phaser banks?

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.174
I don't think so.

01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:25.551
What happened?

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.928
They've knocked out
the automation center.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.596
I've got no control.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.014
Mr. Sulu?

01:05:31.056 --> 01:05:32.558
Nothing, sir.

01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:38.146
So...

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.816
we're a sitting duck.

01:05:44.653 --> 01:05:47.072
Ready to fire
emergency tube.

01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:53.704
Why haven't they
finished us?

01:05:53.745 --> 01:05:56.290
They outgun me
1 0 to 1 .

01:05:56.373 --> 01:06:00.085
My lord, the enemy
commander wishes a truce.

01:06:00.127 --> 01:06:02.754
Put him on-screen.

01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:05.716
This is Admiral
James T. Kirk

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.759
of Federation starship
Enterprise.

01:06:09.887 --> 01:06:13.056
So...the Genesis
commander himself.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.100
A violation of treaty-

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:19.229
your presence here
is an act of war.

01:06:19.313 --> 01:06:22.274
You have two minutes
to surrender,

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:24.860
or we will destroy you.

01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:26.320
He's hiding
something.

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:28.864
We may have hit him

01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:31.325
more seriously
than I thought.

01:06:31.408 --> 01:06:33.368
How can you tell?

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:35.412
I trust
my instincts.

01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:38.457
Admiral Kirk, this is
your opponent speaking.

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:41.335
Don't lecture me
about treaty violations.

01:06:41.418 --> 01:06:44.338
The Federation, in creating
an ultimate weapon,

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:47.758
has become a gang
of intergalactic criminals.

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:50.761
It is you
who will surrender.

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:01.855
On the planet below,

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:03.899
I have three prisoners

01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:09.321
from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon.

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:11.990
If you do not
surrender immediately,

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:14.326
I will execute them
one at a time

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:16.245
as enemies
of galactic peace!

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:17.621
Who is this?

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:19.373
How dare you
take prisoners?

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:22.167
Who I am
isn't important.

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:25.671
That I
have them is.

01:07:25.754 --> 01:07:28.715
I will allow you
to speak to them.

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:35.347
Admiral, this is
Lieutenant Saavik.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.431
Saavik!

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:38.725
Is David with you?

01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:41.395
Yes. Also
a Vulcan scientist

01:07:41.478 --> 01:07:43.480
of your acquaintance.

01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:48.527
This...

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:49.736
Vulcan...

01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:53.949
Is he alive?

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:56.785
He's not himself,
but he lives.

01:07:56.827 --> 01:07:59.621
He's subject
to rapid aging.

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.249
Hello, sir.
It's David.

01:08:02.332 --> 01:08:04.793
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:08.130
I should've
known you'd come.

01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:11.550
This planet will
destroy itself in hours.

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:13.468
David,
what went wrong?

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:16.305
I went wrong.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:18.055
I don't understand.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.018
Just don't surrender.
Genesis doesn't work.

01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:25.272
I can't believe
they'd kill us for it.

01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:28.066
I meant
what I said.

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:31.569
To show that my intentions
are sincere,

01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:34.698
I shall kill one
of the prisoners.

01:08:34.865 --> 01:08:36.908
Wait!
Allow me to talk.

01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:22.621
Saavik?

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.042
David?

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:34.758
Admiral,
David is dead.

01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:48.939
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:58.949
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

01:10:08.834 --> 01:10:11.879
You Klingon bastard!

01:10:11.962 --> 01:10:15.966
There are two more
prisoners, Admiral.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:19.803
Do you want
them killed, too?

01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:21.847
Surrender your vessel.

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:26.643
All right.

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:28.145
All right, damn you.

01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:31.648
All right.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:40.032
Give me a minute
to inform my crew.

01:10:40.073 --> 01:10:41.867
I give two minutes

01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:44.494
for you and your
gallant crew.

01:10:54.004 --> 01:10:55.422
Take every last man.

01:10:55.506 --> 01:10:57.591
Form a boarding
party armed heavily.

01:10:57.674 --> 01:10:58.759
They outnumber us.

01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:00.260
We are Klingons!

01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:02.262
Once you control
the ship,

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:04.264
we'll transfer
our flag there

01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:08.477
and take Genesis from their own
memory banks.

01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:19.279
Mr. Sulu,

01:11:19.363 --> 01:11:21.657
what is the crew complement
of a bird of prey?

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.910
About a dozen
officers and men.

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.955
With some of them
on the planet.

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:34.002
I swear to you,
we're not finished yet.

01:11:34.086 --> 01:11:36.964
Bones, you and Sulu
to the transporter room.

01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:40.968
The rest of you,
we have a job to do.

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:45.138
Commander,
Klingon vessel...

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.141
Prepare to board
on my next signal.

01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:50.561
No tricks, Kirk.

01:11:50.644 --> 01:11:52.688
You have one minute.

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.982
No tricks.

01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:58.694
I'm looking
forward to meeting you.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:17.546
Computer, this is
Admiral James T. Kirk.

01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:19.214
Request security access.

01:12:22.926 --> 01:12:26.013
Computer,
destruct sequence one,

01:12:26.054 --> 01:12:28.807
code 1 -1 a.

01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:39.776
Computer, Commander Montgomery
Scott, chief engineering officer.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:45.574
Destruct sequence two,
code 1 -1 a-2b.

01:12:51.288 --> 01:12:53.916
Computer, this is
Commander Pavel Chekov,

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:56.043
acting science officer.

01:12:56.126 --> 01:12:59.213
Destruct sequence three,

01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:03.550
code 1 b-2b-3.

01:13:03.634 --> 01:13:07.471
Destruct sequence
completed and engaged.

01:13:07.554 --> 01:13:09.973
Awaiting final code
for one-minute countdown.

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:15.103
Code zero zero zero.

01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:18.357
Destruct.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.733
Zero.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:24.613
Destruct sequence
is activated.

01:13:32.996 --> 01:13:36.333
Kirk, the time
runs out.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:37.960
All set?

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:39.211
Aye, sir.

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:43.131
Commander,
Klingon vessel.

01:13:43.215 --> 01:13:46.134
We are energizing
transporter beam now.

01:13:46.218 --> 01:13:49.304
Transporter, stand by.

01:14:06.405 --> 01:14:07.614
Hara.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:38.520
My lord, the ship appears
to be deserted.

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:41.857
How can that be?
They're hiding!

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.027
The bridge
is run by computer.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.279
It's the only
thing speaking.

01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.364
Speaking?

01:14:49.448 --> 01:14:50.782
Let me hear.

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:55.662
9...8...7...6...

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:57.247
5...

01:14:57.331 --> 01:15:00.292
Get out!
Get out of there!

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.627
1...

01:15:56.849 --> 01:16:00.936
My God, Bones,
what have I done?

01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:05.065
What you had to do.
What you always do.

01:16:05.107 --> 01:16:08.777
Turn death into
a fighting chance to live.

01:16:11.655 --> 01:16:13.532
Planet core readings.

01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:16.326
Unstable,
changing rapidly.

01:16:18.036 --> 01:16:19.830
What about
surface life signs?

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:22.249
There.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:40.559
Yaaa!

01:16:58.702 --> 01:17:00.871
Aah!

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:12.758
No, don't
touch him.

01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:06.353
Bones.

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:45.517
What happened?

01:18:45.559 --> 01:18:48.520
He gave his life
to save us.

01:18:52.566 --> 01:18:54.026
Rapid aging.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:57.029
All genetic functions
highly accelerated.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:58.697
What about his mind?

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.199
His mind's a void.

01:19:00.282 --> 01:19:04.369
It seems I've got
all his marbles.

01:19:04.453 --> 01:19:06.538
Is there anything
we can do?

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:09.458
Only one thing-
get him off this planet.

01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:13.629
His aging is part
of what's going on around us.

01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:41.657
Klingon Commander, this is
Admiral James T. Kirk.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:44.618
I'm alive and well
on the planet surface.

01:19:44.701 --> 01:19:47.746
I know this will come
as a pleasant surprise,

01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:50.666
but our ship had
an unfortunate accident.

01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:52.334
Sorry about your crew,

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.629
but as we say on Earth,
c'est la vie.

01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:00.801
I have what you want.

01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:04.847
I have the secret
of Genesis.

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:10.769
You're going to have to
bring us up there to get it.

01:20:10.853 --> 01:20:12.688
Do you hear me?

01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:17.317
I'm waiting for you.

01:20:19.611 --> 01:20:21.363
What is your answer?

01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:30.914
Aaahhh!

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.381
Drop all weapons!

01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:46.221
Over there.
All but Kirk.

01:20:55.772 --> 01:20:57.024
Maltz.

01:20:57.107 --> 01:20:59.401
Prisoners are
at beam coordinates.

01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:01.069
Take the Vulcan, too.

01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:02.237
No!

01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:03.697
But why?

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.282
Because you wish it.

01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:22.299
Genesis.
I want it!

01:21:22.341 --> 01:21:25.219
Beam the Vulcan up,

01:21:25.302 --> 01:21:27.221
and we'll talk.

01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:29.139
Give me what I want,

01:21:29.223 --> 01:21:31.099
and I'll consider it.

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:33.227
You fool,
look around you!

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.937
The planet's
destroying itself!

01:21:34.978 --> 01:21:37.606
Yes, exhilarating,
isn't it?

01:21:37.648 --> 01:21:41.401
If we don't help each other,
we'll die here.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:45.113
Perfect. Then that's
the way it shall be.

01:22:00.546 --> 01:22:03.549
Give me Genesis!

01:22:34.538 --> 01:22:35.706
Aah!

01:23:05.277 --> 01:23:06.653
Give me your hand!

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:17.206
I...

01:23:17.289 --> 01:23:18.999
have had...

01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:20.959
enough of you!

01:24:35.284 --> 01:24:38.328
Maltz...

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:40.581
Jolyichu!

01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:02.978
Don't.

01:25:03.061 --> 01:25:04.229
How many more?

01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:06.023
Just him, sir.

01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:08.358
Bones, help Spock.

01:25:08.442 --> 01:25:11.028
We've got to
break out of orbit.

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:13.822
You,
help us or die.

01:25:13.864 --> 01:25:16.491
I do not
deserve to live.

01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:18.827
Fine. I'll
kill you later.

01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:20.287
Let's get
out of here.

01:25:31.715 --> 01:25:33.675
Where's the damn
anti-matter inducer?

01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:34.885
This?

01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:36.595
No, this!

01:25:37.971 --> 01:25:40.057
That or nothing.

01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:49.358
If I'm right,
we have full power.

01:25:49.399 --> 01:25:50.692
Go, Sulu.

01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:06.583
Goodbye, David.

01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.921
We are clear
and free to navigate.

01:26:11.004 --> 01:26:12.714
Best speed to Vulcan.

01:26:12.798 --> 01:26:14.216
Take the prisoner below.

01:26:14.299 --> 01:26:15.217
Aye, sir.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.886
Wait. You said
you would kill me.

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:18.929
I lied.

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:28.564
Spock,

01:26:28.605 --> 01:26:31.650
for God sakes,
talk to me.

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:38.073
You stuck this damn thing
in my head, remember?

01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:39.241
Remember?

01:26:41.869 --> 01:26:44.788
Now tell me
what to do with it.

01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:47.958
Help me.

01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:08.770
I'm going to
tell you something

01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:13.609
that I never thought
I'd ever hear myself say.

01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:19.281
But it seems
I've missed you.

01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:25.120
I don't know
if I could...

01:27:25.162 --> 01:27:27.998
stand to
lose you again.

01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:47.059
Ambassador,
they're on approach.

01:27:47.142 --> 01:27:49.353
They're requesting
permission to land.

01:27:50.812 --> 01:27:52.064
Permission granted.

01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:53.732
Tell them...

01:27:53.815 --> 01:27:55.734
tell Kirk...

01:27:55.817 --> 01:27:57.402
we'll be ready.

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:08.205
Mr. Sulu,
you're on manual.

01:28:08.288 --> 01:28:10.374
It's been a while, sir.

01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:11.708
Here we go.

01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:25.597
Retrothrusters.

01:29:11.185 --> 01:29:13.270
Sarek is waiting
above, sir.

01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:14.122
Kaltorfalikal.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.876
Sarek...

01:30:19.837 --> 01:30:22.422
Child of Skon,

01:30:22.506 --> 01:30:24.299
child
of Solkar...

01:30:26.343 --> 01:30:29.680
the body of your son
breathes still.

01:30:31.515 --> 01:30:33.267
What is
your wish?

01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:37.729
I ask for
Fal-tor-pan,

01:30:37.813 --> 01:30:39.064
the re-fusion.

01:30:40.482 --> 01:30:44.736
What you seek has not
been done since ages past...

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.739
and then,
only in legend.

01:30:47.823 --> 01:30:50.784
Your request
is not logical.

01:30:50.826 --> 01:30:52.828
Forgive me, T'lar.

01:30:52.911 --> 01:30:58.250
My logic...is uncertain

01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:00.711
where my son
is concerned.

01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:06.091
Who is the keeper
of the Katra?

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:08.927
I am.

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.387
McCoy,

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:13.182
Leonard H.,
son of David.

01:31:13.223 --> 01:31:16.226
McCoy, son of David,

01:31:16.268 --> 01:31:17.644
since
thou art human,

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:19.229
we cannot
expect thee

01:31:19.313 --> 01:31:21.023
to understand fully

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:23.567
what Sarek
has requested.

01:31:23.609 --> 01:31:25.861
Spock's body lives.

01:31:25.903 --> 01:31:27.321
With your approval,

01:31:27.404 --> 01:31:29.781
we shall use
all our powers

01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:31.783
to return
to his body

01:31:31.867 --> 01:31:34.203
that which
you possess.

01:31:35.704 --> 01:31:36.955
But, McCoy,

01:31:37.039 --> 01:31:38.749
you must
now be warned.

01:31:38.832 --> 01:31:41.376
The danger
to thyself

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:45.797
is as grave
as the danger to Spock.

01:31:49.468 --> 01:31:51.553
You must
make the choice.

01:31:54.765 --> 01:31:56.725
I choose the danger.

01:31:58.769 --> 01:32:01.230
Hell of a time
to ask.

01:32:30.509 --> 01:32:36.640
Ben... val...navu.

01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:14.631
I'm all right, Jim.

01:35:17.551 --> 01:35:19.595
What about Spock?

01:35:19.678 --> 01:35:22.639
Only time
will answer.

01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:27.644
Kirk...

01:35:27.728 --> 01:35:29.104
I thank you.

01:35:29.188 --> 01:35:30.272
What you
have done-

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:31.648
What I have done...

01:35:31.732 --> 01:35:34.318
I had to do.

01:35:34.401 --> 01:35:36.737
But at what cost?

01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:39.281
Your ship, your son.

01:35:40.782 --> 01:35:43.410
If I hadn't tried,

01:35:43.452 --> 01:35:45.495
the cost would've
been my soul.

01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:24.178
My father says

01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:27.181
that you have
been my friend.

01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:30.350
You came back
for me.

01:37:30.434 --> 01:37:33.353
You would have done
the same for me.

01:37:35.772 --> 01:37:37.941
Why would
you do this?

01:37:41.528 --> 01:37:45.115
Because the needs
of the one...

01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:47.784
outweigh the needs
of the many.

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:11.850
I have been

01:38:11.892 --> 01:38:14.853
and ever shall be

01:38:14.895 --> 01:38:16.188
your friend.

01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:17.814
Yes.

01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:20.567
Yes, Spock.

01:38:22.402 --> 01:38:24.363
The ship...

01:38:24.404 --> 01:38:25.656
out of danger?

01:38:25.697 --> 01:38:28.033
You saved the ship.

01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:29.660
You saved us all.

01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:31.537
Don't you remember?

01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:46.301
Jim.

01:38:49.054 --> 01:38:51.932
Your name is Jim.

01:38:53.392 --> 01:38:54.476
Yes.
