00:00.041 --> 00:01.750
Previously on
Being Mary Jane...

00:01.753 --> 00:04.346
I'm working on some things to
get Niecy and the kids with me.

00:04.354 --> 00:06.017
Niecy, you don't hear
Isabelle in there screaming?

00:06.020 --> 00:08.640
She's fine. I just looked in
on her a few minutes ago.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.766
She has to cry through it.
That'll teach her independence.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.641
And who's teaching
you independence?

00:12.645 --> 00:14.807
He couldn't possibly
want her like that.

00:14.808 --> 00:16.641
Oh, my God.
We're talking about David?

00:16.643 --> 00:17.848
I just feel like I need closure.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.662
He's with somebody else, mama.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.600
When he came over that night,
he didn't want to leave.

00:21.615 --> 00:24.761
I think you should go through the
process of freezing your eggs.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.968
It's like the modern day
woman's insurance policy.

00:27.187 --> 00:28.273
Done.

Hola, velma.
- Hola, Ms. Mary.

00:40.253 --> 00:44.026

00:44.027 --> 00:47.185
_

00:49.551 --> 00:52.383

00:52.407 --> 00:53.476
No, no...

00:53.477 --> 00:54.867
_

00:55.711 --> 00:59.819
_

01:01.725 --> 01:04.474
No, I never called you obese, Niecy.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.681
Those words never
came out of my mouth.

01:06.683 --> 01:08.765
I didn't call you fat either.

01:08.766 --> 01:10.969
Well, maybe.

01:11.342 --> 01:12.881
Okay, no. No.

01:12.928 --> 01:14.896
That's not right either.
What are you trying to say, Paulie?

01:14.920 --> 01:16.357
What are you trying to say?

01:17.017 --> 01:18.744
What I'm trying to say, Niecy,

01:18.759 --> 01:20.337
is that you are a...

01:20.953 --> 01:22.656
...bigger girl.

01:22.788 --> 01:24.247
Some might even say

01:24.248 --> 01:26.140
"overweight."

01:26.142 --> 01:29.319
Ugh. By whose standards?
- America's!

01:29.321 --> 01:31.844
I don't know. The first lady's
"let's move!" Campaign...

01:31.850 --> 01:33.642
The American diabetes
association.

01:33.645 --> 01:35.181
I just had a freaking baby.

01:35.183 --> 01:36.646
I've lost 15 pounds already.

01:36.670 --> 01:38.881
I know, and I am so
proud of you, but I...

01:38.912 --> 01:40.177
maybe I just don't want you to,
you know,

01:40.193 --> 01:41.630
fall back into old habits.

01:41.832 --> 01:43.872
This is me being motivational.

01:43.874 --> 01:46.121
Well, I don't feel motivated.

01:46.123 --> 01:47.957
I feel ridiculed
and forced to be a size two.

01:47.961 --> 01:49.290
No, no. No, no.

01:49.293 --> 01:51.777
Absolutely not, because
I'm not a size two.

01:51.823 --> 01:54.238
This conversation is
about your health,

01:54.240 --> 01:56.049
about diabetes,
high cholesterol,

01:56.073 --> 01:58.075
high blood pressure.
- I am healthy.

01:58.115 --> 01:59.699
I'm just thick.
- No, no.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.533
No, do not get me started on the

02:01.534 --> 02:03.477
whole "I'm thick" conversation.

02:03.485 --> 02:05.776
Oh, please, get started.
Please.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.237
Okay. Okay. Why does
every overweight

02:08.244 --> 02:10.650
black woman in the hood
think she's thick?

02:10.862 --> 02:13.261
We don't eat well.
We don't exercise,

02:13.277 --> 02:16.078
and then we justify our
diabetes, high cholesterol,

02:16.086 --> 02:19.025
and high blood pressure by
saying, "I was born this way.

02:19.026 --> 02:21.727
God... God made me 60 pounds
overweight."

02:21.750 --> 02:23.476
'Cause, you know what,
it's all fun and games

02:23.492 --> 02:26.693
until you lose a foot
at 40 from diabetes,

02:26.716 --> 02:28.948
messing around trying
to be an ass model on instagram.

02:28.964 --> 02:31.776
Ain't nobody gonna call you thick
when you got three toes left.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.003
Auntie, you are
so brainwashed.

02:34.018 --> 02:37.346
No, no, you were the one,
baby doll, that was crying

02:37.369 --> 02:39.069
because you didn't feel beautiful.

02:39.110 --> 02:42.525
First of all, I was pregnant
and full of hormones.

02:42.527 --> 02:45.776
But I'm not saying I can't
stand to lose some weight.

02:45.777 --> 02:48.175
I can, but I'm gonna let you

02:48.191 --> 02:50.105
or anybody else convince me

02:50.112 --> 02:52.983
that skinny is it when models
are passing out on runways

02:52.985 --> 02:54.688
they can't even
walk down and back.

02:54.703 --> 02:57.702
And you can't walk up a flight of
stairs without breathing heavy.

03:00.235 --> 03:03.443
Trust me. I don't want to be
having this conversation with you,

03:03.447 --> 03:05.943
but because I love you so...

03:07.193 --> 03:09.150
Much.

03:09.151 --> 03:10.235
Okay.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.650
I remember a few months ago,
I came across some research

03:16.652 --> 03:19.933
that linked overeating
with depression.

03:20.985 --> 03:22.443
No. Okay?

03:22.447 --> 03:24.233
I'm not depressed.

03:24.235 --> 03:26.324
The snacks under the bed

03:26.363 --> 03:28.198
are for Treyvion.

03:29.026 --> 03:31.416
I keep them in here so he won't
be running all over your house

03:31.440 --> 03:33.549
with food as per
your house rules.

03:34.026 --> 03:37.233
We both know Treyvion didn't
eat all that food by himself.

03:37.235 --> 03:38.817
Come on, now.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.776
Look, I really am
trying to help.

03:41.777 --> 03:43.777
I could be, like,
your life coach.

03:43.779 --> 03:46.208
So because I'm living in your
house, I got to do what you say?

03:46.224 --> 03:47.819
No, no... yes.

03:47.822 --> 03:49.442
Yes, you do,

03:49.443 --> 03:53.108
because I want you to leave
here better than when you came.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.944
'Cause you know
this is temporary, right?

03:58.130 --> 04:00.091
How much weight do I have to lose

04:00.099 --> 04:03.914
to muzzle you up, auntie?
- It's not about weight.

04:04.235 --> 04:06.173
It's about a healthy body,

04:06.610 --> 04:09.193

05:25.944 --> 05:28.692
I told you, I hate
the taste of water.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.402
Did you read your quote
this morning?

05:34.961 --> 05:37.656
There is an ever-increasing
number of women in this country

05:37.695 --> 05:40.439
nearing the age of 40 who
still desire motherhood,

05:40.455 --> 05:43.376
but find themselves single and
without a traditional option.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.564
Well, I'm one of those women,

05:45.735 --> 05:47.317
and today, I'm happy to report

05:47.318 --> 05:50.317
that societal attitudes finally
seem to be catching up to us

05:50.318 --> 05:54.043
and what modern science has been
doing since the early 1970s.

05:54.406 --> 05:56.336
After the break,
our talk back cameras

05:56.352 --> 05:59.764
will follow me into a fertility
clinic and roll camera

05:59.796 --> 06:02.282
as I take the first step in
a two-week course of treatment

06:02.285 --> 06:04.777
to stop my own biological clock

06:05.027 --> 06:07.405
through a process known
as cryopreservation,

06:07.407 --> 06:10.447
more commonly referred
to as egg freezing.

06:10.449 --> 06:13.238
You don't want to miss this.
Stay with us.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.239
Cross fade on the logo.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.821
This is Dr. Jacob Marrs.

06:16.823 --> 06:19.863
He's a reproductive
endocrinologist and gynecologist.

06:20.105 --> 06:21.730
We just completed the ultrasound.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.145
Everything checked out okay,

06:23.146 --> 06:25.531
so we're going to move
onto the next phase.

06:25.570 --> 06:26.662
Dr. Marrs,

06:26.663 --> 06:28.741
thank you so much for guiding me
through this journey.

06:28.772 --> 06:29.803
Thank you for taking it.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.029
Tell him to go a little
tighter in on the doctor there.

06:32.053 --> 06:34.770
Just recently
lifted the experimental label

06:34.772 --> 06:36.001
from egg freezing,

06:36.024 --> 06:38.056
declaring the technique safe,

06:38.079 --> 06:40.896
effective, and standard.

06:40.897 --> 06:42.604
But I'm 38.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.563
Did I wait too late?
- No.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.777
However, starting the process
as early as possible is ideal.

06:48.313 --> 06:50.812
See, what he did there was he...
he offered a kind way

06:50.814 --> 06:53.297
of saying I should've brought
my tail in just a little sooner.

06:53.324 --> 06:55.269
Mention the insurance coverage.
- I had to work.

06:55.277 --> 06:58.647
This is a very expensive
process, one that is not covered

06:58.648 --> 07:00.298
by most insurance plans.
- Yes,

07:00.335 --> 07:02.421
on average,
just to take the drugs...

07:02.468 --> 07:03.913
Talk about the injection.

07:03.928 --> 07:06.374
Talk about the drugs
that women have to take.

07:06.939 --> 07:08.305
You mentioned drugs.

07:08.563 --> 07:10.397
Now, that's the first step
in this process,

07:10.400 --> 07:12.314
the ten-day treatment

07:12.315 --> 07:14.123
of hormone shots, correct?

07:14.155 --> 07:16.647
Yes, yes. If you could hop
up on the table, please.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.232
Now, what can you tell me about

07:18.264 --> 07:20.061
the injection I'm about to receive?

07:20.092 --> 07:23.826
It's a follicle-stimulating
hormone injection

07:23.881 --> 07:26.373
referred to as FSH,

07:26.427 --> 07:27.982
and you'll give it to yourself

07:28.006 --> 07:29.735
once a day for ten days.

07:29.813 --> 07:33.478
MJ, ask him what women
should avoid doing or...

07:33.480 --> 07:35.839
Or drinking or any of that.
Don't forget to ask that.

07:36.193 --> 07:38.669
You'll drop more than
one egg at a time.

07:39.443 --> 07:42.442
Is there anything I should avoid
during this ten-day process?

07:42.443 --> 07:43.817
Stress,

07:43.819 --> 07:45.358
secondhand smoke,

07:45.360 --> 07:47.852
alcohol, jacuzzis.
- Okay.

07:47.899 --> 07:50.493
So I shouldn't be stressed out
drinking in a jacuzzi

07:50.501 --> 07:52.040
next to somebody smoking.
Got it.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.618
One glass of wine
a night is fine.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.095
Okay. I'm...

07:55.751 --> 07:57.485
...really nervous.
I hate needles.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.943
All right. Make sure we get
a shot of the needle, okay?

07:59.946 --> 08:01.983
You're going to be fine.

08:01.985 --> 08:04.817
Do me a favor. Count
down from five for me.

08:04.819 --> 08:06.272
Five, four,

08:06.291 --> 08:07.483
three,

08:07.507 --> 08:08.674

09:24.290 --> 09:27.883
The house is so quiet
without Niecy and the kids.

09:28.170 --> 09:30.373
If by quiet, you
mean peaceful,

09:30.375 --> 09:31.457
then, yes.

09:35.499 --> 09:37.621
You should put the
three right there.

09:37.623 --> 09:40.861
See? Then you have it
horizontally and vertically.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.497
I saw that.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.623
Mm-hmm.

09:47.873 --> 09:51.080
I don't know where you're
going with this story,

09:51.082 --> 09:53.247
you and the eggs.

09:53.249 --> 09:55.997
It's this whole infotainment angle
that Kara and I are taking.

09:55.998 --> 09:58.122
A lot of the new shows
are doing it, mom.

09:58.123 --> 10:01.330
Well, I don't see why you
have to be the Guinea pig.

10:01.332 --> 10:04.758
I'm sure there are plenty
of other desperate women

10:04.782 --> 10:08.165
out there willing to put
all their business on TV.

10:09.499 --> 10:11.405
I... I'm not even sure

10:11.413 --> 10:13.207
how to respond
to that lovely kick to the face.

10:13.209 --> 10:15.381
I guess my desperation,

10:15.383 --> 10:18.038
we'll... We'll just see
how that turns out.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.997
Mm-hmm.

10:20.998 --> 10:22.830
How is Niecy?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.330
Great.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.538
Yeah.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.249
I think we made
a little breakthrough.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.541
She's exercising and eating

10:29.542 --> 10:32.229
healthy and obeying my rules.

10:33.290 --> 10:34.784
For now.

10:36.623 --> 10:38.747
Have you eaten?

10:38.748 --> 10:40.982
No, I've been doing this.

10:41.036 --> 10:42.965
All right. I'm gonna
make some lunch.

10:42.998 --> 10:44.497
Oh, thank you.

10:44.499 --> 10:46.830
But don't make me
anything healthy.

10:47.281 --> 10:49.655
Remember, I'm closer
to dying than living.

10:49.657 --> 10:51.047
Make it good...

10:51.117 --> 10:52.867
Tasty.

10:52.946 --> 10:54.322
Okay.

10:54.365 --> 10:57.240
Hm. Okay.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.669
I didn't
know you were home.

11:01.273 --> 11:04.355
And I didn't know I had to
announce myself in my own house.

11:04.357 --> 11:06.813
At 28, I don't think
our parents' house

11:06.815 --> 11:08.397
qualifies as your house.

11:08.399 --> 11:10.980
I'm still living here, okay?

11:10.981 --> 11:12.903
Now, go on, letta.
I'm working.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.147
The gifting alliance?

11:15.148 --> 11:17.771
How did you manage to
get an invite to this?

11:17.773 --> 11:18.980
How?

11:18.981 --> 11:21.148
Because I'm Paul Patterson, hater.

11:21.152 --> 11:22.448
I'm not hating.

11:22.472 --> 11:24.439
I just don't understand
how one minute

11:24.440 --> 11:26.315
you're twirling mattress signs
on the corner,

11:26.346 --> 11:29.680
and then the next, you're being invited
to elite millionaire investment meetings.

11:29.681 --> 11:30.977
You think they made
their millions working

11:30.989 --> 11:32.406
a 9:00 to 5:00,
punching a time clock,

11:32.415 --> 11:33.681
taking 45-minute lunches?

11:33.713 --> 11:34.938
No. They took risks.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.148
And how did you make
the millionaires club, huh?

11:37.152 --> 11:38.564
Selling weed?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.147
I just used my weed nest egg

11:40.148 --> 11:43.272
to buy a 20% stake in a cannabis
dispensary in Colorado.

11:43.273 --> 11:46.105
So, yeah, maybe.

11:46.107 --> 11:49.630
The Harvard business review called
cannabis the next billion-dollar industry.

11:49.661 --> 11:51.813
Do you understand
how huge this is?

11:51.815 --> 11:53.482
I mean,
Sheldon DeWitt is speaking.

11:55.518 --> 11:58.601
I've been trying to get an interview
with him since I was at CNN.

11:59.399 --> 12:01.172
It's settled.
- What?

12:01.188 --> 12:04.453
I'm your plus one.
- Hah. No, you're not.

12:04.469 --> 12:05.855
I already have a plus one.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.063
Who?

12:07.065 --> 12:09.897
My business partner.
- What business partner?

12:09.898 --> 12:12.366
The person I'm in business with.
Now, go on.

12:16.812 --> 12:19.897
Did Dr. Morris go over all
the side effects with you?

12:19.898 --> 12:21.397
Yes, he did.

12:21.399 --> 12:23.008
There's nausea,

12:23.031 --> 12:25.352
weight gain, night sweats,

12:25.375 --> 12:26.671
headaches,

12:26.765 --> 12:29.507
acne, and insomnia.
I am fully informed.

12:29.531 --> 12:30.531
Thank you.

12:31.773 --> 12:34.232
I know you're still processing
David and the pregnancy.

12:34.235 --> 12:36.569
No. I'm not, Lisa.

12:36.695 --> 12:39.648
David and I have moved on, and
we really wish you would too.

12:39.774 --> 12:43.022
Look, I don't know how
much more clear I can be.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.813
Kara and I discussed this whole
egg freezing thing months

12:45.815 --> 12:47.897
before I ever found out
anything about David.

12:47.898 --> 12:51.720
Okay, then why can't we just
take a beat and talk about it?

12:52.065 --> 12:54.533
Mary Jane,
I really just want to help you.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.722
You want to help me, Lisa?

12:55.724 --> 12:58.056
Just give me the damn shot.
I don't need a lecture

12:58.072 --> 13:00.580
or a diagnosis from you.
Just the shot. Okay?

13:00.603 --> 13:02.140
I want to make sure you
you're doing this for you

13:02.143 --> 13:03.806
and not some one-up to David.

13:03.807 --> 13:05.518
You know what, never mind.
I'll do it myself.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.018
Thank you.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.080
It's best I learn how to do
this anyway

13:09.087 --> 13:11.875
since I have to give myself the
shot the same time every day.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.016
Thank you.

13:27.648 --> 13:29.155
Niecy, can you
come here for a second?

13:29.179 --> 13:30.567
Really, Mary Jane?

13:31.773 --> 13:33.107
Yeah, auntie. What's up?

13:33.110 --> 13:35.336
I need you to give
me this injection.

13:37.065 --> 13:38.147
Isn't...

13:38.148 --> 13:39.480
Yeah.

13:39.482 --> 13:41.522
I'ma talk to the
two of you later.

13:41.524 --> 13:43.399
We don't need her. Okay?

13:43.402 --> 13:44.771
I've already cleaned the area.

13:44.773 --> 13:46.480
Lisa's prepared the shot.

13:46.482 --> 13:49.105
All you have to do is stick me.
- Then why can't you do it?

13:49.107 --> 13:51.439
Bec... because I asked
you to do it, okay?

13:51.440 --> 13:53.522
Just stick me. All right?

13:53.524 --> 13:54.940
That's all you got to do.

13:56.606 --> 13:59.480
Okay, so I'm sure
there's a YouTube video

13:59.482 --> 14:01.023
that can teach me
how to do this.

14:01.027 --> 14:02.773
So I'ma go look one up,
and I'll be right back.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.066
Can you hurry up, please?

14:06.885 --> 14:09.408
Mama!
- Sit down.

14:09.611 --> 14:13.147
I see, yes, I understand that
you can't get another ticket.

14:13.148 --> 14:15.855
Uh-huh. All right. Thanks.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.607
The mayor
can't get another ticket?

14:17.611 --> 14:19.095
I have no one else to call.

14:19.353 --> 14:22.915
Oh, no. You get back on that phone,
and you call PJ, and you beg him.

14:22.938 --> 14:25.232
You lease him a new car.
You do whatever you have to do.

14:25.235 --> 14:26.688
We need that ticket, MJ.

14:31.482 --> 14:33.065
Hello?

14:33.068 --> 14:34.440
PJ. Hey.

14:34.444 --> 14:36.813
Seriously, I'ma need
to be your plus one.

14:36.815 --> 14:38.774
Letta, I'm not just
gonna disinvite someone.

14:38.776 --> 14:39.940
Don't make me pull the

14:39.943 --> 14:41.773
"but you owe me" card,
'cause you do

14:41.776 --> 14:43.482
for everything
that you have done,

14:43.485 --> 14:45.482
everything that you're gonna
do that I'ma find out about

14:45.483 --> 14:46.606
and have to bail your ass out.

14:46.607 --> 14:47.816
PJ, please.

14:47.817 --> 14:49.022
Please.

14:49.023 --> 14:50.105
Please.

14:50.107 --> 14:51.607
Hey, look.

14:51.611 --> 14:53.524
Are we really having
this conversation right now?

14:53.527 --> 14:56.135
Yes, we are
having this conversation.

14:56.455 --> 14:57.682
PJ.

14:57.707 --> 14:58.908
Um.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.666
PJ.

15:01.273 --> 15:02.938
PJ.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.480
Letta, listen.
Listen, listen.

15:05.482 --> 15:08.247
Um. Okay.

15:08.263 --> 15:09.855
Listen, letta. All right?

15:09.856 --> 15:11.272
The answer's no.

15:11.273 --> 15:12.938
Okay? It's no. Call David.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.898
I hear he's got an invite.
What do you... what do you want?

15:14.902 --> 15:16.606
What do you want?

15:16.607 --> 15:20.023
You still talk to David?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

15:20.027 --> 15:21.545
Y'all's relationship

15:21.999 --> 15:25.467
or whatever you got going on is
completely separate from our friendship.

15:25.506 --> 15:27.564
All right.
I'll take to you later.

15:27.565 --> 15:30.232
Oh, God. Girl, you
so damn sexy.

15:33.357 --> 15:34.754
Listen.

15:34.755 --> 15:36.247
I have a meeting downstairs.

15:36.262 --> 15:39.713
Lance and the team are cooking
up some stories for Monday,

15:39.721 --> 15:41.180
so I'll run them by you later,
okay?

15:41.191 --> 15:43.940
Right after you find me another
ticket to the gifting alliance?

15:43.943 --> 15:47.230
You better find that ticket, girl.
Get on that phone.

15:47.232 --> 15:48.856
Do your thing. Come on.

16:08.856 --> 16:10.788
David paulk.
- Hey.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.938
Uh, David, it's Mary Jane.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.813
Hey, Mary Jane. How are you?

16:16.815 --> 16:18.272
I'm good.

16:18.273 --> 16:19.754
How are you?

16:19.755 --> 16:21.356
Uh...

16:21.357 --> 16:22.855
Doing all right.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.980
Good.
That's good.

16:24.981 --> 16:27.352
So I heard about this event,

16:27.609 --> 16:29.147
the gifting alliance,

16:29.148 --> 16:31.413
and I sort of remember you were

16:31.460 --> 16:35.272
affiliated with this investment
group that sponsored it.

16:35.273 --> 16:38.188
Well, actually, I was
attempting to affiliate myself,

16:38.190 --> 16:40.565
but this is my first
actual invite.

16:42.065 --> 16:44.480
Attempting to affiliate,
yes, I stand corrected.

16:44.482 --> 16:48.810
Curious... do you have access
to additional tickets?

16:48.833 --> 16:50.541
No, I don't.

16:50.565 --> 16:52.330
I don't know anything
about any additional tickets.

16:52.354 --> 16:54.439
I mean, I do have a plus one.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.564
I would prefer your tickets.

16:57.565 --> 17:00.439
I'm sure, but they're
non-transferrable, so.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.465
Okay, well, I
will stand by while you

17:03.496 --> 17:06.559
run that by your live-in
girlfriend slash baby mama.

17:07.617 --> 17:08.897
I'm sure she won't mind.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.914
All I can offer you is
my plus one, Mary Jane.

17:12.815 --> 17:15.938
I would love your plus one.
Thank you.

17:15.940 --> 17:19.813
Well, I guess we'll just
meet up there, right?

17:19.815 --> 17:22.230
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good to me.

17:22.232 --> 17:23.981
Okay. I'll see you then.

17:23.984 --> 17:25.772
Okay, I'll see...

17:35.399 --> 17:38.105
Come here, buddy. Come here.

17:38.107 --> 17:39.938
Come here. Hey, buddy.

17:39.940 --> 17:43.105
Funny how we both get calls
from the exes today.

17:43.107 --> 17:45.765
Yeah, Mary Jane just wants to
go to the gifting alliance.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.897
I thought you said
you weren't gonna go.

17:48.898 --> 17:50.773
I said I wasn't sure.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.355
Well, I gave Sarah all the
documents overnight to graphics.

17:56.357 --> 17:58.482
We should be done with
the adjustments for the site

17:58.485 --> 17:59.814
by tomorrow,

17:59.837 --> 18:01.617
and we should go over the
marketing strategy for the world

18:01.633 --> 18:03.355
fashion collective next week.

18:03.357 --> 18:04.855
I want to make a good showing.

18:04.856 --> 18:06.439
Wait. Go back.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.188
And I'm going to
leave for Florence

18:09.190 --> 18:11.522
on the 11th instead
of the 12th.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.072
I want to get there a few
days before the collective.

18:15.607 --> 18:17.230
Bram's gonna be there.

18:17.232 --> 18:19.314
He wants to talk.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.272
Oh.

18:21.273 --> 18:23.107
About what?

18:29.940 --> 18:32.711
Is that why it was so important for
you to attend this conference?

18:33.068 --> 18:36.018
I can't cut him off any more
than you can cut off Mary Jane.

18:36.773 --> 18:39.314
Well, I think it's a
little different.

18:39.315 --> 18:40.771
There's no difference.

18:40.773 --> 18:42.980
Well, actually, there's
a big difference.

18:42.981 --> 18:45.475
You can't compare
some dude living in Australia

18:45.483 --> 18:47.938
to somebody who's living right here.
- Some dude?

18:47.940 --> 18:49.399
We were together
for three years.

18:49.402 --> 18:52.522
I owe him closure at least.

18:52.524 --> 18:54.272
At least?

18:54.273 --> 18:56.771
Does closure at least
mean you have intentions

18:56.773 --> 18:59.022
on going out there and
sleeping with him?

18:59.023 --> 19:01.399
Isn't that what happened with
you and Mary Jane at the hotel?

19:01.402 --> 19:03.853
Pretty sure I told
you we talked.

19:04.357 --> 19:05.938
Didn't have sex.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.773
Well, that's all we're
gonna do, too, is talk.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.760
All right.
Watch your alignment, pop.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.584
You turned a little to the left.

19:15.945 --> 19:17.237
Just don't want to pull it.

19:20.873 --> 19:22.103
All right.

19:22.104 --> 19:24.582
Not bad. Not bad.
- Yeah.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.259
Ah, that's a good one.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.957
Eh, it's okay.
I used to get close to the flag.

19:31.958 --> 19:33.595
Yeah, I remember. Ha-ha.

19:35.072 --> 19:37.692
Just a little rusty. It'll
all come back to you.

19:38.165 --> 19:40.071
Hey, you know what,
just like old times,

19:40.086 --> 19:43.112
you and I out here together.
- Yeah, it is.

19:43.873 --> 19:45.706
Yeah. Golfing is your sport.

19:45.707 --> 19:47.248
You've got the mind for it.

19:50.751 --> 19:51.876
Uh-oh.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.791
How are things going
with the job?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.080
They're going all right.

19:59.081 --> 20:01.332
Talked to my supervisor
about getting some overtime,

20:01.335 --> 20:03.822
so he's lobbying
for me, this boss.

20:04.207 --> 20:06.123
I'm still putting out
resumes, so.

20:06.127 --> 20:07.871
Well, that's good.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.896
What about the apartment for
you and Niecy and the kids?

20:12.457 --> 20:14.374
Now they're saying
a couple more months.

20:16.690 --> 20:18.858
Patrick, you know I... I
could make a few calls for you.

20:18.860 --> 20:21.230
Dad, no.
- No, no. Hear me out.

20:21.232 --> 20:22.647
Your sheepskin from morehouse

20:22.649 --> 20:24.315
and your experience
running your own business,

20:24.319 --> 20:26.023
you could have
a management job today.

20:26.027 --> 20:27.898
Well, thank you, dad, but I
don't want you to do anything.

20:27.902 --> 20:29.230
I wasn't asking for anything.

20:29.232 --> 20:32.399
I know you're not asking, but listen you...
- Paul Patterson.

20:32.402 --> 20:34.147
Hey, George.

20:34.148 --> 20:36.549
Good to see you. Good to see you.
It's been a while.

20:36.588 --> 20:38.283
It's been a while.
You remember my son, Patrick.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.149
Yes. How are you?

20:40.258 --> 20:42.813
If I'm not mistaken you're the
one with that dance club.

20:42.815 --> 20:45.361
Downtown around about?
- Yes, sir.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.897
Yeah, it... It closed
a few years back.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.782
What you got going now?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.980
Well...

20:53.981 --> 20:55.897
Hey, George.

20:55.898 --> 20:57.773
I want to ask you
about that building project

20:57.776 --> 20:59.482
that you and leanne
had at the vineyard.

20:59.483 --> 21:02.771
What's going on with that?
- They're still working on it.

21:02.773 --> 21:05.109
It's leanne's pet project.
I've given up.

21:05.288 --> 21:07.931
She had the contractor
redo the kitchen twice,

21:07.959 --> 21:10.023
and then she picks out
a backsplash...

21:25.107 --> 21:26.981
Do you want
me to call Dr. Marrs again?

21:26.984 --> 21:28.743
No, it'll pass.

21:29.483 --> 21:31.952
Auntie, are you sure you
should be going out?

21:32.576 --> 21:34.739
Yeah, baby. I have to go.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.350

Come on. I'm not gonna

23:38.607 --> 23:40.581

23:42.065 --> 23:44.107
Greg. Hey.

23:44.971 --> 23:46.887
Babe, give mommy one minute,
okay?

23:46.914 --> 23:49.036
I'll be right back. Promise.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.105
Hey.

23:53.107 --> 23:55.522
So we've got our egg

23:55.524 --> 23:57.445
and they're not bad.
They're fine.

23:57.453 --> 23:58.880
Now, I pulled in a lot
of favors

23:58.888 --> 24:00.700
to get the network to cover
Mary Jane's medical costs.

24:00.716 --> 24:02.565
I know, and I promise
it's gonna be worth it.

24:02.569 --> 24:05.397
And the good news is that
Mary Jane's Facebook

24:05.399 --> 24:08.438
and Twitter pages are flooded
with messages from women

24:08.445 --> 24:09.771
all around the country.

24:09.773 --> 24:12.148
They love what we're doing.
- Good.

24:12.152 --> 24:13.393
And, hey,

24:13.395 --> 24:16.995
I talked Mary Jane
Paul into hormone injections.

24:17.027 --> 24:18.816
I mean, that's like a miracle. Right?

24:18.839 --> 24:21.914
Keep me appraised.
- I will. Thank you, Greg.

24:23.773 --> 24:26.190
I met Sheldon DeWitt back in...

24:26.193 --> 24:29.943
Well, best I can
recall, may of 1998,

24:30.183 --> 24:33.745
when I had the unfortunate
occasion to be opposing council

24:33.776 --> 24:35.691
on a little court case:

24:36.065 --> 24:39.250
Fielder versus mcglothlin foods.

24:40.524 --> 24:43.310
I'm sure there's a second-year
law student out there

24:43.325 --> 24:47.355
somewhere learning all about how
we had our proverbial asses

24:47.357 --> 24:49.522
handed to us by Mr. DeWitt

24:49.524 --> 24:53.230
and his merry practice
group of avengers.

24:53.232 --> 24:55.003
But all joking aside,

24:55.004 --> 24:56.771
quite simply,

24:56.773 --> 24:59.766
Sheldon is the best civil
trial lawyer I know.

25:00.055 --> 25:03.323
Hell, I even tried to recruit
him a couple of times myself,

25:03.745 --> 25:07.084
but he made more money suing
all of my clients instead.

25:08.025 --> 25:11.179
Sheldon has spent over 20 years

25:11.565 --> 25:13.510
fighting David and goliath cases

25:13.570 --> 25:17.356
and taking on corrupt
multibillion-dollar corporations,

25:17.357 --> 25:19.813
and now, three years
into his retirement,

25:19.815 --> 25:22.111
he is back to help us understand

25:22.166 --> 25:24.673
not only why it's
good to give back,

25:24.837 --> 25:27.762
but how giving back can
increase our wealth.

25:28.648 --> 25:30.496
Do I have your attention now?

25:30.965 --> 25:32.543
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:32.683 --> 25:35.813
my dear friend Sheldon DeWitt.

25:46.149 --> 25:48.523
Thank you
for that introduction, Harold.

25:48.526 --> 25:51.688
Listen, I often tell people when
I do these types of engagements

25:51.690 --> 25:54.521
that it was not until I
stopped hunting money

25:54.523 --> 25:58.064
that I began to reflect
on its inequities.

25:58.065 --> 26:00.605
The wealthy, they
can buy justice.

26:00.606 --> 26:02.004
They do every day.

26:02.043 --> 26:04.081
But what can the poor buy

26:04.082 --> 26:06.147
when someone's
ransacked their hopes

26:06.149 --> 26:08.443
and profited from
their insecurities?

26:09.190 --> 26:11.230
As a friend of mine once said,

26:11.232 --> 26:13.605
"equality is a commodity."

26:13.606 --> 26:15.064
I believe that.

26:15.065 --> 26:17.605
I believe it's
easier to get money

26:17.606 --> 26:20.976
than to change the structure of
our community, of our world.

26:21.381 --> 26:23.944
But as Harold pointed
out, I love a challenge.

26:31.315 --> 26:32.982
Mr. DeWitt.
- Hello.

26:32.985 --> 26:35.180
You must be friends
with Walter mosley...

26:37.107 --> 26:39.524
The friend that you referenced
in the speech you just gave,

26:39.526 --> 26:41.274
the one that told you equality
is a commodity?

26:41.277 --> 26:43.356
I was referencing
Walter mosley, yes.

26:43.357 --> 26:44.730
But he's not really a friend.

26:44.731 --> 26:49.605
No? I totally count all
of my imaginary friends.

26:49.606 --> 26:52.194
They're some of my better
conversationalists.

26:52.773 --> 26:54.920
I don't believe we've met.
Sheldon.

26:55.315 --> 26:56.752
Mary Jane Paul.
- Pleasure.

26:56.775 --> 26:58.549
It's great to
finally meet you.

26:58.563 --> 27:00.095
Nice to meet you.

27:00.134 --> 27:01.931
Do you have a second?
- Sure.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.107
Okay.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.865
So an interview...
That's what you want.

27:09.517 --> 27:12.368
I've been following your career
for years, ever since I was

27:12.399 --> 27:14.882
a correspondent back
in my early days...

27:14.905 --> 27:17.265
Simpson versus Texas petroleum,

27:17.623 --> 27:20.481
rand versus Southern... I
could go on and on and

27:20.496 --> 27:22.550
on and on.

27:22.640 --> 27:26.015
I'm impressed, but I'm sure you're well
aware I've never granted an interview.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.306
I am.

27:27.307 --> 27:29.307
But earlier, during
your speech,

27:29.309 --> 27:32.805
you spoke so eloquently
about your new awakenings,

27:32.807 --> 27:36.349
ideological shifts, so
perhaps you need a platform

27:36.350 --> 27:38.222
to discuss your new views.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.763
Very well played.
- Have I convinced you?

27:40.765 --> 27:42.139
No.

27:42.140 --> 27:44.306
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

27:44.307 --> 27:45.515
Then neither will I.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.014
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.222
Thank you for listening.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.391
And thank you,

28:06.392 --> 28:07.555
and thank you.

28:07.556 --> 28:08.870
And listen so and tweedle Dee

28:08.871 --> 28:10.180
and tweedle dum.

28:41.681 --> 28:44.347
So bad. So bougie.

28:49.765 --> 28:50.847
Ooh.

28:50.933 --> 28:52.132
Uh.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.147
Where's the Palmer's
around here?

28:59.163 --> 29:00.473
Seriously.

29:11.109 --> 29:12.804
Ooh.

29:52.441 --> 29:55.329
Did you remember to leave the
porch light on for junior?

29:56.182 --> 29:57.932
Yeah, I turned it on.

30:01.315 --> 30:04.716
You never did tell me how
it went today with Patrick.

30:05.899 --> 30:07.759
It went well.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.103
Hm.

30:11.107 --> 30:12.663
Yeah, it went well.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.503
What was he talking about?

30:17.398 --> 30:20.035
He asked his boss
for overtime.

30:20.732 --> 30:22.929
Oh, that's good.

30:23.607 --> 30:26.862
More hours means more money.

30:27.481 --> 30:29.822
Maybe he'll be able to get
on the seat soon, huh?

30:30.815 --> 30:32.957
Hm.

30:34.523 --> 30:36.190
What is it?

30:40.899 --> 30:43.049
He won't let anybody help him.

30:44.149 --> 30:46.190
It's his pride.

30:48.315 --> 30:50.347
I wonder where he got that.

30:52.375 --> 30:54.086
It's not the same, Helen.

30:55.523 --> 30:57.149
Paul.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.398
Baby,

31:03.548 --> 31:06.390
he wants to do it on his own.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.273
But he doesn't have to.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.557
Hm.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.782
You know, sometimes,

31:17.871 --> 31:19.554
I think I worked too much,

31:20.607 --> 31:22.123
traveling.

31:25.107 --> 31:28.132
You give your whole
life to a place

31:29.690 --> 31:33.605
and turn around years later and
realize it was the wrong place.

31:33.607 --> 31:37.480
I... I should've been here.

31:37.481 --> 31:38.878
I should've been here

31:38.879 --> 31:41.522
when they were growing up.
- Oh, baby.

31:41.523 --> 31:46.565
You were... are a good father.

31:52.273 --> 31:54.273
You should've seen him today,
Helen.

32:00.815 --> 32:03.141
You know that little...

32:04.773 --> 32:06.273
Smile he has?

32:09.752 --> 32:11.720
He's gonna be fine.

32:14.273 --> 32:16.315
Let him show you he can do it.

32:18.732 --> 32:20.857
Be patient with him.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.940
Yeah.

32:33.315 --> 32:34.973
Mm-hmm.

32:35.815 --> 32:37.690
Next.

32:48.210 --> 32:49.377
Mm.

32:54.127 --> 32:56.375
Ooh, is she drinking again?

32:57.134 --> 32:58.634
Mm.

33:08.481 --> 33:09.482
What?

33:14.224 --> 33:15.653
Ooh,

33:16.357 --> 33:18.524
auntie.

33:22.732 --> 33:24.194
Wow.

33:26.149 --> 33:27.605
Oh.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.982
How many times I've told you not
to walk to your car by yourself?

33:35.273 --> 33:38.397
It's not a circumstance I choose,
but I manage to survive.

33:38.398 --> 33:41.022
All right, well. I'm here.

33:41.024 --> 33:43.563
Did you tell Ana I
was your plus one?

33:43.565 --> 33:47.271
I did, and I'll tell her I
walked you to your car too.

33:47.273 --> 33:48.674
Hm.

33:50.356 --> 33:51.867
Yeah, she's got

33:52.324 --> 33:54.647
another guy out in Australia.

33:54.648 --> 33:56.480
Wow.

33:56.481 --> 33:58.113
You guys
have an open relationship.

33:58.184 --> 33:59.715
How very modern of you.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.399
I don't know what we have.

34:02.107 --> 34:05.147
What am I supposed to
say to that exactly?

34:05.149 --> 34:06.940
Or is that just
some sort of update

34:06.944 --> 34:08.647
on your relationship status?

34:08.648 --> 34:12.273
We're having a conversation, I thought.
- About what, exactly?

34:13.982 --> 34:15.397
It's complicated.

34:15.398 --> 34:17.855
We are too damn old to
be complicated, David.

34:17.857 --> 34:20.022
And yet that has been our
entire relationship.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.149
That was
our entire relationship, yes,

34:22.152 --> 34:24.324
but I want something different.

34:24.565 --> 34:25.605
Come here.

34:40.773 --> 34:43.147
No. No.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.563
Mary Jane, listen. Listen.

34:45.565 --> 34:47.271
Okay, I know.

34:47.273 --> 34:50.452
I really, really messed this up.
I know.

34:50.507 --> 34:53.331
Stop. Okay? Just stop.

34:53.982 --> 34:56.005
We always do this.

34:56.242 --> 34:59.451
Every time, we always do this.

35:00.421 --> 35:02.110
And then it's over,

35:02.139 --> 35:04.022
and you go on about your life,

35:04.024 --> 35:07.106
and then, there I am
left behind waiting,

35:07.107 --> 35:08.962
hoping that you call me

35:08.963 --> 35:10.814
or send me Calla Lilies

35:10.815 --> 35:13.461
or show up at my house
with chips and salsa.

35:13.857 --> 35:16.355
You know, you keep saying
I'm the crazy person,

35:16.356 --> 35:20.064
but you're the one who
plays mind games, David.

35:20.065 --> 35:22.041
I'm not some third wheel

35:22.057 --> 35:23.775
to help you get over the hump
with your baby mama,

35:23.799 --> 35:25.939
and I'm not the
side chick who...

35:25.940 --> 35:28.480
When your wife gives you lazy head.
I'm not.

35:28.481 --> 35:29.528
What?

35:30.489 --> 35:32.560
I don't know when I
became that person.

35:32.940 --> 35:35.107
I have worked so hard

35:35.108 --> 35:36.774
to be someone new.

35:37.273 --> 35:38.859
God, I... I just...

35:39.523 --> 35:41.738
I just want to feel
good about me.

35:42.913 --> 35:45.060
You get that?

35:46.317 --> 35:47.815
Just feel good about me.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.940
Mary Jane.
- No, no, no. Don't. No, stop.

35:52.944 --> 35:55.772
No. Leave me alone, David.

35:55.773 --> 35:58.522
Seriously. Okay?

35:58.523 --> 35:59.690
