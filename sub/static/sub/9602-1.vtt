No problem.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.146
I did not.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.032
I don't see a stain.

15:12.203 --> 15:16.697
Ah, well, no problem, then. Off to dinner.
Can't wait for that surprise.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.284
Is something wrong?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.661
Huh?

15:19.710 --> 15:23.043
Wrong? Oh, come on. No, no, no.
Everything's just fine.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.006
You aren't hiding anything from me,
are you?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.962
Any more secrets?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.468
Secrets?

15:31.347 --> 15:32.336
(COUGHS)

15:33.474 --> 15:37.843
Of course not. Uh...
I almost lost you once that way.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.470
-|'|| never make that mistake again.
-(SQUAWKS)

15:40.523 --> 15:41.558
What?

15:47.989 --> 15:49.525
Yee-haw!

15:52.535 --> 15:56.653
He's big. He's blue. He's back!

15:56.706 --> 15:58.321
-Genie!
-You came back!

15:58.374 --> 16:01.207
Ow! Ooh! Watch the sunburn!

16:02.712 --> 16:06.830
Ha! Kidding! Did you miss me?
Be honest.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.545
Take care of these, my good mammal.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.379
Careful, they're heavy. Hang on.
I got souvenirs for everybody.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.388
Whoo, she dances.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.432
You saw the whole world already?

16:22.565 --> 16:25.181
(SINGING) It’s a small world after all

16:26.027 --> 16:29.690
But Agrabah has something that
no other place in the world has.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.773
You guys!

16:38.456 --> 16:41.163
(SINGING) l parachuted down
into the Taj Mahal

16:41.250 --> 16:43.832
l rollerbladed all along
the great Great Wall

16:43.920 --> 16:46.662
I even made the famous
Leaning Tower fall

16:46.756 --> 16:50.590
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody!

16:50.927 --> 16:53.589
The Moscow Circus hired me
to fly trapeze

16:53.638 --> 16:56.254
On Mount Olympus
ran a race with Hercules

16:56.307 --> 16:59.094
It's easy when you're chased by
killer bees

16:59.143 --> 17:02.761
Who said, "Gesundheit, "
when lsneezed (SNEEZES)

17:02.980 --> 17:04.936
So now I'm home

17:05.024 --> 17:07.606
Home again with you

17:07.693 --> 17:10.275
You chase the clouds away

17:10.488 --> 17:12.444
Whenever! am blue

17:12.490 --> 17:13.605
You're always blue.

17:13.699 --> 17:18.614
And though the pyramids
I highly recommend

17:19.622 --> 17:24.958
There is nothing in the world
quite like a friend

17:25.169 --> 17:28.206
Slept like a babe in Bombay
on a bed of nails

17:28.464 --> 17:30.955
Moroccans loved my daring
Dance of Seven Veils

17:31.050 --> 17:33.541
Why, single-handedly
I even saved the whales

17:33.636 --> 17:36.173
No one was there to hear my tales

17:36.264 --> 17:37.629
(WEEPS)

17:37.682 --> 17:40.640
In Acapulco, joined a mariachi band

17:40.726 --> 17:43.308
I rode the raging rapids
down the Rio Grande

17:43.354 --> 17:45.845
Flew in an air balloon
But when I tried to land

17:45.982 --> 17:49.691
Nobody laughed or lent a hand

17:50.027 --> 17:52.814
Without you
the Amazon is just a trickle

17:52.863 --> 17:55.479
Without you
the Sahara's not so hot

17:55.575 --> 17:58.658
Without you
Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet

17:58.744 --> 18:01.486
The QE2 is just some yacht

18:03.249 --> 18:05.581
Now that I'm home

18:05.668 --> 18:08.000
Home again, it's clear

18:08.504 --> 18:10.495
All I ever wanted

18:11.173 --> 18:14.165
Seems to be right here

18:14.260 --> 18:20.005
I've traveled east and west
and now I’m back again

18:20.266 --> 18:25.727
And there '3 nothing in the world
quite like a friend

18:26.022 --> 18:29.014
There 's nothing in the world

18:29.066 --> 18:31.398
Nothing in the whole wide world

18:31.527 --> 18:37.397
There is nothing in the world
quite like a friend

18:42.705 --> 18:45.071
Nothing in the whole wide world!

18:45.875 --> 18:48.241
So, Genie, how does it feel to be free?

18:48.419 --> 18:50.910
Seriously? I love it!

18:51.005 --> 18:51.994
(CRACKING)

18:52.298 --> 18:55.040
Okay, maybe my powers aren't
what they used to be.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.875
Let's say they're semi-phenomenal,
nearly cosmic.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.426
But don't sell me short.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.217
I may be free,
but I still have some magic in me.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.219
I can still do this!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.722
Hate to lose face in front of you guys.
Give me another chance.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.437
Who's first? I can do this.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.228
-Genie. Genie, we have to go to...
-Dinner. We're late!

19:17.657 --> 19:22.276
Oh! You probably have
a romantic dinner for two planned.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.153
You don't need a big blue lug
gumming up the works.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.497
-But, Genie...
-Three's a crowd. You kids go on.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.161
Genie, I would be honored
if you'd join us for dinner.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.290
You would?

19:35.299 --> 19:36.664
Come on, everyone,

19:36.759 --> 19:38.124
get in here.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.592
Home cooking, let's go!

19:41.013 --> 19:42.503
Oh, boy! (SQUEAKS)

19:42.973 --> 19:45.931
Not you, Abu.
You have a job to do, remember?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.094
You have to guard Iago.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.177
Oh!

19:53.484 --> 19:55.975
Giddy up, slowpoke.
What's keeping you?

19:56.278 --> 19:59.145
Nothing. Well, something,

19:59.782 --> 20:01.113
but I'll tell you later.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.321
That stinking Aladdin!

20:09.166 --> 20:11.532
That stinking Abis Mal.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.289
First chance we get,
let's slice him in half.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.245
Hey! Get over here and wash up!

20:16.340 --> 20:18.752
It's bad enough to have to look at you
without having to smell you.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.670
Come, we do it now.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.376
No witnesses.

20:24.849 --> 20:25.838
Ow!

20:26.350 --> 20:29.558
What is this? So help me,
I'll sue whoever runs this well.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.934
A lamp?

20:31.021 --> 20:36.311
It might be worth a few shekels
once it's cleaned up.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.519
It will be of little use to you, Abis Mal,

20:39.613 --> 20:43.151
except to light your way
in the Valley of the Dead.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.606
Ah!

20:44.744 --> 20:45.950
It is bewitched!

20:46.829 --> 20:48.615
(EVIL LAUGHTER ECHOES)

20:52.084 --> 20:53.073
(WHINNIES)

20:58.966 --> 21:00.422
I am free!

21:00.801 --> 21:04.385
Free to exact vengeance upon he
who has imprisoned me.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.760
(GRUNTING)

21:10.561 --> 21:12.176
It is the curse of the lamp.

21:12.271 --> 21:18.016
All the power in the universe and
I am bound by the rules of the genie.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.695
Which means I can't kill
that upstart Aladdin.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.700
Unless I have someone
arrange it for me.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.073
Take me to Agrabah at once!

21:30.164 --> 21:31.153
(WHIMPERS)

21:34.126 --> 21:35.787
(JABBERS AND WHIMPERS)

21:38.130 --> 21:43.124
I suppose I am a bit too much
for his limited mind.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.973
I trust you'll find me
a little less overwhelming now?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.467
You're a genie?

21:54.188 --> 21:57.100
You are astonishingly perceptive.

21:59.985 --> 22:04.604
If you're a genie,
then don't I get wishes?

22:04.907 --> 22:07.398
Yes, three wishes.
That is a minor formality.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.530
But first, I must go to Agrabah.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.909
You will take the lamp there for me.

22:14.792 --> 22:18.205
Then, uh, you need me.

22:19.547 --> 22:24.632
I'll take you to Agrabah,
but first, I want my wishes.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.258
(YELPING)

22:33.227 --> 22:35.013
Why, you...

22:41.277 --> 22:44.110
You shall have your wishes.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.281
I shall? I mean, of course I shall.
(LAUGHS)

22:48.367 --> 22:51.234
I want riches, treasure.
Let's see... I know...

22:51.370 --> 22:56.706
I wish for the legendary
sunken treasure ship of Kordumair.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.750
Your wish is my command.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.328
Oh!

23:11.181 --> 23:13.263
Poor, sweet baby.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.675
Aren't we enjoying our wish?

23:15.811 --> 23:16.846
No!

23:17.229 --> 23:19.845
Perhaps you wish me to return you
to the desert?

23:20.524 --> 23:21.559
Yes.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.140
Very well.

23:28.282 --> 23:32.070
That was two wishes.
Take your time with the third,

23:32.161 --> 23:35.824
or you will wish
you had never been born.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.707
On the other hand,
if you cooperate with me,

23:39.793 --> 23:42.751
I will see that you are amply rewarded.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.711
-Rewarded?
-First,

23:44.798 --> 23:47.540
you will help me get revenge
on a certain street rat

23:47.635 --> 23:51.594
by the name of Aladdin.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.472
Aladdin? I want revenge on him, too!

23:55.559 --> 23:57.345
He robbed me,
turned my men against me,

23:57.436 --> 23:59.176
and he fought dirty!

23:59.271 --> 24:01.762
My brilliant swordsmanship
availed me not.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.016
I hate when I do that.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.478
Let's not be too hasty,
my simple-minded friend.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.406
It's not enough that
we simply destroy Aladdin.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.279
After all,

24:14.578 --> 24:18.947
there are things
so much worse than death.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.581
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

24:30.344 --> 24:34.383
Okay, prepare yourselves
for a real culinary treat.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.219
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

24:38.602 --> 24:39.933
Oh, my!

24:41.939 --> 24:43.270
Whoopsie!

24:48.904 --> 24:50.394
Most amusing.

24:51.532 --> 24:56.777
Amusing? Right.
Excuse me while I pull myself together.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.577
(LAUGHING)

24:58.622 --> 25:00.613
Absolutely delightful.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.952
Now to business.

25:03.502 --> 25:08.838
Aladdin, you have proven to be
a man of strong moral character.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.546
That is why I've decided to make you

25:13.220 --> 25:15.836
my new royal vizier.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.550
Me? Really?

25:17.891 --> 25:19.131
Isn't it wonderful?

25:20.227 --> 25:23.219
Wow! Royal vizier!

25:24.690 --> 25:27.602
Aladdin would like to thank
the Academy for this great honor.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.024
You want 'em, we got 'em,

25:29.111 --> 25:30.317
royal vizier T-shirts.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.939
(HORN SOUNDING)

25:32.114 --> 25:34.651
All hail Aladdin, the royal vizier!

25:34.742 --> 25:37.199
So, what's a royal vizier?

25:38.162 --> 25:42.781
Well, he will be my most trusted advisor.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.491
Well, that makes sense.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.919
He's bound to be better than
that Jafar character.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.333
Quite so.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.791
-And Iago! Talk about a rat with wings.
-Uh, Genie?

25:54.136 --> 25:56.798
Phew! That bird was mean.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.054
Sultan want a cracker?
Sultan want a cracker?

25:59.141 --> 26:00.256
Remember that?

26:00.350 --> 26:03.763
I can still taste them, the traitor!

26:04.271 --> 26:05.431
Yes, sir.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.480
You don't see this guy hanging out
with any evil parrots.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.349
(LAUGHS) Uh...

26:10.444 --> 26:13.026
It's funny you should mention Iago.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.733
Oh, oh, monkey?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.315
(HOOTING)

26:17.367 --> 26:21.781
Come on, monkey.
Little birdie want to talk to monkey.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.237
Have nice banana.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.529
(HOOTING)

26:25.000 --> 26:30.245
Birdie get monkey a pretty banana
if monkey open cage. Yum-yum.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.704
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:31.799 --> 26:36.259
Come on!
I've got a wife and three eggs!

26:36.720 --> 26:40.759
(SOBS) Imagine them hatching,
never knowing their daddy.

26:40.849 --> 26:44.216
Come on! Open the cage!

26:44.311 --> 26:46.552
Open it, open it, open it!

26:48.065 --> 26:50.226
Yeah, that's more like it. Ah!

26:50.317 --> 26:51.682
(GROWLS)

26:52.194 --> 26:55.061
Close the cage!
Close it, close it, close it!

26:59.827 --> 27:00.816
(YELLS)

27:02.371 --> 27:04.828
Aladdin, your monkey's
trying to kill me!

27:04.915 --> 27:06.655
I saved your life!

27:07.042 --> 27:09.749
It's payback time, Aladdin.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.245
(YELLS)

27:14.466 --> 27:15.455
Whoa! (YELLS)

27:15.634 --> 27:17.170
Aladdin!

27:23.851 --> 27:27.685
Rajah, you know better than to
tear around the palace like that.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.352
Help! Hey!

27:29.898 --> 27:31.559
So, Aladdin,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.437
why did you bring up
that deceitful parrot?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.863
Uh, Sultan, I have to tell you something
about Iago.

27:38.907 --> 27:39.987
(SNEEZES)

27:42.369 --> 27:43.358
(GULPS)

27:43.579 --> 27:44.864
He's here.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.030
-(GASPS) Iago! Guards!
-(ALADD|N PROTESTING)

27:48.083 --> 27:50.199
-No, wait! You don't understand.
-Get that bird!

27:50.252 --> 27:51.537
Yes, Your Highness.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.248
It would be my pleasure.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.745
No, Sultan, no!

27:55.465 --> 27:58.798
-Move out of my way, boy.
-You don't understand. Just listen.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.133
-I have a...
-Your Highness!

28:00.262 --> 28:04.301
I trust he has a fitting explanation
for this scandal.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.760
He had better.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.592
Your Highness, I think Iago was... Uh...

28:09.271 --> 28:10.351
Mesmerized.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.439
Yeah, yeah. He was under Jafar's spell.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.935
Remember the snake staff?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.274
Iago was only... Uh...

28:17.821 --> 28:18.936
Look, | just...

28:18.989 --> 28:20.445
lago's not all that bad.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.528
At least, I don't think so, anyway.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.282
Should have stuck with
the snake staff defense.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.450
Not all bad?

28:29.541 --> 28:32.624
He only served my greatest enemy,
that's all!

28:32.878 --> 28:36.120
We can't allow that
traitorous bird to run free!

28:36.298 --> 28:38.459
Then I'll watch him! Uh...

28:39.301 --> 28:42.634
Your Highness, I meant,
with your permission,

28:42.679 --> 28:45.967
I'd like to take full responsibility
for Iago.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.051
You would?

28:47.142 --> 28:50.179
Your priorities seem
questionable to me,

28:50.312 --> 28:52.223
but so be it.

28:52.856 --> 28:57.566
Aladdin, you will watch Iago
every moment.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.195
And if the bird makes one wrong move,

29:02.366 --> 29:05.358
you shall be the one | pluck, boy.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.153
Uh, that could've gone worse.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.329
Jasmine, I thought I was sunk.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.823
Ooh, not good.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.583
You were hiding Iago all along,
weren't you?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.665
I think it just got worse.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.830
Well, yes. But...

29:19.883 --> 29:23.375
How could you?
More secrets, more lies.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.670
Aladdin, I thought you had changed.

29:26.848 --> 29:31.012
Jasmine, wait!
Back in the marketplace, Iago, he...

29:31.687 --> 29:32.847
He saved my life.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.892
Some grand vizier I'm going to make.
Everybody's mad at me.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.525
Hey, Jasmine's just a little steamed.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.568
This isn't cheering you up, is it?

29:51.873 --> 29:52.862
Yuck!

29:52.958 --> 29:54.198
I don't get it, Genie.

29:54.251 --> 29:57.709
I try to do something good
and it blows up in my face.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.789
(SIGHS) That's the problem with
doing the right thing.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.250
Sometimes you do it by yourself.

30:05.762 --> 30:10.381
That kid saved my life.
Nobody's ever looked out for me before.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.304
Now it's... It's like I owe him.

30:13.895 --> 30:14.930
Nah!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.887
Just let your conscience be your guide.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.565
Conscience? Never had one. Never.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.564
Phew! What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

30:27.409 --> 30:29.149
A-ha! You do have a heart.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.826
An itty-bitty one, but it is there.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.666
Can you quit with
the hocus-pocus already?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.329
Look at him.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.503
Would it kill you to
do something nice for him?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.923
Possibly. I don't do nice.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.091
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.591
I don't do fun, either.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.255
We have to get A! and the Princess
back together.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.761
Look, I definitely don't do mushy stuff.
It's not me.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.021
I know, but it's going to be tricky.

31:00.108 --> 31:04.101
Tricky is good. Tricky I can do.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.860
(WEEPING)

31:12.120 --> 31:13.985
IAGO: Come on, Princess,

31:14.122 --> 31:15.862
don't waste your tears on him.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.372
You! You get out of here!

31:18.460 --> 31:20.291
Hey! Don't take it out on me!

31:20.379 --> 31:24.042
He's the creep.
I never should've saved his life.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.299
Saved his life?

31:28.345 --> 31:31.303
Yeah, he owed me one.
That's why he stood up for me.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.304
But he didn't have to lie to me.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.967
You are so right.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.015
(SINGING) Forget about that guy

31:39.856 --> 31:43.474
Forget about the way
you fell into his eyes

31:45.362 --> 31:47.353
Forget about his charms

31:47.864 --> 31:51.231
Forget about the way
he held you in his arms

31:53.412 --> 31:57.155
Walking on air's obnoxious

31:57.249 --> 32:01.367
The thrills, the chills
will make you nauseous

32:01.503 --> 32:03.084
And you'll never get enough

32:03.880 --> 32:06.212
Just forget about love

32:06.716 --> 32:09.048
She's buying it.
Now make with the magic.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.175
Forget about romance

32:11.847 --> 32:15.385
Forget about the way
your heart begins to dance

32:15.517 --> 32:16.723
Jasmine.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.510
Then you feel the blush

32:19.938 --> 32:23.522
When he’s spouting out
some sentimental mush

32:26.236 --> 32:29.194
Love really is revolting

32:29.406 --> 32:33.365
It's even worse than
when you're molting

32:33.452 --> 32:35.363
Enough of this ﬂuff

32:35.871 --> 32:37.361
Just forget about love

32:37.456 --> 32:41.040
I had almost forgotten the way it felt

32:41.084 --> 32:44.747
When he held out his hand for mine

32:45.255 --> 32:47.416
My heart all aﬂutter

32:47.549 --> 32:49.039
Oh, how I shudder

32:49.134 --> 32:51.375
The ﬁrst time we kissed

32:51.470 --> 32:53.051
It won ’t be missed

32:53.388 --> 32:54.798
Forget about his touch

32:57.392 --> 32:59.428
It doesn’t matter much

32:59.561 --> 33:03.395
-It matters so much
-You're better on your own

33:03.899 --> 33:07.483
A meal becomes a banquet
when you eat alone

33:07.652 --> 33:09.358
(HUMMING)

33:09.404 --> 33:13.238
-Love's ﬁlled with compromises
-Love's ﬁlled with compromises

33:13.408 --> 33:17.401
And don ’t you hate those
big surprises?

33:17.454 --> 33:19.740
A cozy rendezvous

33:19.789 --> 33:21.450
Oh, please!

33:21.583 --> 33:24.916
-Candlelight for two
-Oh, jeez!

33:24.961 --> 33:26.917
Look, you’re calling my bluff

33:27.005 --> 33:30.623
-I can 't forget about love
-Just forget about love

33:32.052 --> 33:33.007
Uh, Jasmine.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.961
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have kept Iago a secret.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.429
-Aladdin, you don't have to... Shh.
-Please, I've got to say...

33:38.934 --> 33:40.925
(SINGING) I can't forget about my heart

33:41.019 --> 33:42.759
I can 't forget about my heart

33:42.812 --> 33:45.770
And how it felt to fall for you
right from the start

33:45.815 --> 33:47.771
I 'm still falling

33:47.817 --> 33:49.478
Whatever we may do

33:49.653 --> 33:51.609
-Whatever we may do
-You are here for me

33:51.655 --> 33:55.273
-And I'll be there for you
-I’// be there

33:55.367 --> 33:59.360
-To wish, to want, to wander
-To wish, to want, to wander

33:59.454 --> 34:03.788
To ﬁnd the sun
through rain and thunder

34:03.833 --> 34:06.119
A cozy rendezvous

34:06.211 --> 34:07.667
Yes, please

34:10.131 --> 34:11.621
IAGO: Oh, jeez!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.126
Enough is enough

34:13.301 --> 34:17.294
-We can 't forget about love
-We can ’t forget about love

34:40.996 --> 34:41.985
(THUDS)

34:42.205 --> 34:43.820
We did it. We're in.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.702
It's about time. It was getting hot.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.828
How very like Iago.

34:51.339 --> 34:55.548
He's lost no time endearing himself
to those in power,

34:55.719 --> 34:59.928
which fits in perfectly with my plan.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.971
I'm sorry, Jasmine.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.006
Shh.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.595
(GENIE SIGHS)

35:04.686 --> 35:07.928
Love. Don't mind us.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.272
Yeah, well, this is
kind of a special moment.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.518
Right. Got it. Say no more.
Enough said. Roger, over and out.

35:19.701 --> 35:20.736
Rolling.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.115
Today's special moments
are tomorrow's memories.

35:25.206 --> 35:29.745
Looking great, Jas. More emotion, Al.
Tilt your chin a bit.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.957
What does he have to do to
make it clear to you Iunkheads?

35:33.048 --> 35:36.211
The show's over!
They want to be alone!

35:36.301 --> 35:37.757
Break it up!

35:38.637 --> 35:40.127
Are you sure about him?

35:40.221 --> 35:42.758
Move it, primate! Shoo! Go on!

35:45.560 --> 35:47.300
That takes care of the peanut gallery.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.886
If you need me,
I'll be lazing about in the lap of luxury.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.223
I'm sure about this.

35:56.404 --> 36:00.818
Oh, yeah. Being one of the good guys
has its advantages.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.065
Ah.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.824
Advisor to Aladdin,
the new grand vizier.

36:06.915 --> 36:13.332
And when Aladdin becomes sultan,
that will make me the grand vizier.

36:13.421 --> 36:17.790
Only I'm not going to blow it
like that idiot Jafar.

36:20.595 --> 36:24.304
I'll never have to stand
in his shadow again.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.600
Jafar!

36:30.939 --> 36:31.974
Buddy?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.517
A funny thing happened.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.853
You see, this guy took the lamp.
You probably thought it was me

36:39.948 --> 36:41.859
because it sounded a lot like me.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.033
But a lot of people sound like me.
Anyway, he took the lamp and... Oh!

36:45.120 --> 36:47.452
Calm yourself, Iago.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.623
I haven't come for revenge against you.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.871
So, that's good to hear.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.330
I got it! I could wish for

36:55.463 --> 36:57.954
the famed treasure chest
of King Malakhan!

37:03.805 --> 37:06.296
Oh, I am dreadfully sorry.

37:06.683 --> 37:10.801
I thought that was your wish.
Are you quite all right?

37:10.854 --> 37:16.520
-No, I am not quite...
-Wonderful. Good to see all's well.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.896
Abis Mal here is my new friend.

37:19.320 --> 37:23.814
And I couldn't help noticing that
you've made some new friends, too.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.820
Like Aladdin.

37:27.537 --> 37:33.658
Friend? "Friend" is such a strong word.
He's more like an acquaintance.

37:33.752 --> 37:38.496
I'm arranging a little surprise
for Aladdin,

37:38.548 --> 37:41.915
and yourjob is to lead him to the party.

37:43.011 --> 37:46.003
You know,
I don't think I'm the guy for this job.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.008
You know, you should talk to...
Uh...

37:48.349 --> 37:51.591
The monkey. Yeah!
The monkey's really got Aladdin's ear.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.768
No, Iago.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.387
You!

38:01.905 --> 38:06.365
You know, Aladdin... AI...
Here's an idea.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.191
l was just thinking...

38:08.244 --> 38:11.236
GENIE: Aiming, focus, focus.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.577
Focus, focus.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.749
Focus, focus.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.289
Aiming and

38:20.548 --> 38:21.583
shoot

38:22.926 --> 38:23.915
(YELLS)

38:28.598 --> 38:31.385
Oh, sorry, little feathered friend.
I'll get that out.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.049
Friend? Ha!

38:34.437 --> 38:35.768
Oh, it's stuck good.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.224
Cue-ball-ectomy.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.308
Nurse!

38:40.735 --> 38:45.479
Abu, Iago here is our friend now.
We can trust him.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.656
Now let's get that ball out of his beak.
What do you say?

38:49.077 --> 38:51.489
Well, okay.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.287
Brilliant, Nurse Heimlich.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.751
Thanks, Bobo.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.672
-It's Abu.
-Whatever.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.248
That's the spirit.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.417
We're all one big family now.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.426
Yeah. Sure. Family.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.756
Oh, brother.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.595
Yeah, well, I've got to find AI.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.096
Your shot.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.473
Pool's a man's game,

39:18.606 --> 39:21.769
so being a rug, you'll be at a...

39:21.943 --> 39:24.275
Ah, pool's a dumb game, anyway.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.607
ALADDIN: I can't explain it, Jasmine.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.484
I think we can trust Iago.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.110
Well,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.697
then I guess I can give him a chance.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.777
(DOOR SQUEAKS)

39:35.957 --> 39:37.037
Jago?
-Uh...

39:39.002 --> 39:41.038
l was just thinking,

39:41.129 --> 39:44.371
maybe it's time you patched things up
with the sultan.

39:44.799 --> 39:48.963
He might enjoy a nice,
scenic carpet ride?

39:49.137 --> 39:50.468
Hmm, that's a good idea.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.513
And I'll bring Genie.
He was a big hit with the sultan.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.723
No! No! No! I mean,

39:55.894 --> 40:00.558
Genie's... He's too flashy, he's too loud.
You'd never get a word in.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.021
Good point, Iago.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.901
You need some quiet time with Father.
Let him get to know you.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.651
Yeah. And I...

40:08.323 --> 40:11.315
-I can take you to the perfect spot.
-Great.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.985
Come on, let's get Father.
Just a minute.

40:15.038 --> 40:18.530
Iago, this isn't easy for me to say,

40:19.751 --> 40:21.867
but I was wrong about you.

40:24.881 --> 40:25.870
(GROANS)

40:26.257 --> 40:28.498
-Wait a second!
-Yes, Iago?

40:31.012 --> 40:32.001
Uh...

40:32.430 --> 40:34.421
I'll be along in a minute.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.725
Excellent.

40:41.397 --> 40:45.891
-Give them a chance, Father.
-Oh, I'll try, dearest.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.146
After you, Your Highness.

40:51.783 --> 40:55.025
Oh! (GIGGLES)

40:56.871 --> 40:59.658
-All right, Carpet, let's go.
-Whoopie!

40:59.707 --> 41:00.867
Have a good time.

41:01.334 --> 41:05.668
Hey, clear the way!
Make room for the picnic boys.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.083
They already left, Genie.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.378
-(GASPS) Without us?
-Without us?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.881
-No problem. I'll catch up in a flash.
-Wait!

41:14.472 --> 41:15.837
Without me, too.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.256
Aladdin needs
some time alone with Father

41:18.351 --> 41:19.511
to patch things up.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.806
You know what this means,
monkey boy?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.137
More food for us!

41:24.273 --> 41:25.683
All right!

41:28.945 --> 41:30.560
I'm sorry. Did you want some?

41:30.655 --> 41:33.567
I'm not hungryjust now.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.364
You two go ahead.

41:41.916 --> 41:42.951
(SULTAN LAUGHS)

41:43.042 --> 41:46.534
Come on, my boy,
show me what this thing can really do.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.171
(ALL YELL)

42:02.562 --> 42:06.396
That's the spot. On top of the waterfall.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.183
I'm losing my feathers here!

42:11.446 --> 42:13.903
You're lucky
you haven't lost more than that.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.945
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

42:20.204 --> 42:21.535
Oh, what fun.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.447
(GROANS)

42:25.668 --> 42:27.078
Iago, l have to hand it to you.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.618
This is a nice place.

42:29.589 --> 42:33.173
It doesn't get any better than this,
eh,shaggy?

42:33.259 --> 42:35.500
How about a nice drumstick?

42:36.637 --> 42:39.629
This could use
some secret herbs and spices.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.135
Spiders!

42:46.272 --> 42:47.933
Things could get ugly.

42:58.868 --> 43:02.656
Sorry to spoil your picnic, boys.

43:02.747 --> 43:05.238
But I can't have any genies
mucking about,

43:05.333 --> 43:08.325
ruining my plans.

43:08.461 --> 43:12.170
Don't worry, Abu. He's a genie,
and genies can't kill anyone.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.926
But you'd be surprised
what you can live through.

43:19.055 --> 43:22.172
(LAUGHING)
You always were good for a laugh.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.385
Oh, yeah?

43:32.902 --> 43:34.017
(PANTING)

43:34.445 --> 43:35.434
(LAUGHS)

43:35.947 --> 43:37.812
Who's laughing now?

43:37.907 --> 43:39.898
(LAUGHING THUNDEROUSLY)

43:41.702 --> 43:43.442
Why, I believe it's me.

43:45.623 --> 43:50.868
(SINGING) lmust admit
your par/or tricks are amusing

43:50.962 --> 43:54.671
I bet you've got
a bunny under your hat

43:56.300 --> 43:59.588
Now here ’3 your chance
to get the best of me

43:59.679 --> 44:01.419
Hope your hand is hot

44:01.973 --> 44:05.386
Come on, clown
Let's see what you’ve got

44:06.310 --> 44:09.017
You can try to slam me
with your hardest stuff

44:09.105 --> 44:11.596
But your double whammy
isn’t up to snuff

44:11.691 --> 44:14.182
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out-of-date

44:14.277 --> 44:16.689
You're only second-rate

44:16.779 --> 44:19.566
You believe your cat's a meany
but your tiger's tame

44:19.657 --> 44:22.364
You've got a lot to learn
about the genie game

44:22.451 --> 44:24.988
So, for your education, [reiterate

44:25.079 --> 44:27.866
You're only second-rate

44:28.499 --> 44:33.619
Men cower at the power in my pinky

44:33.713 --> 44:37.376
My thumb is number one on ever list

44:39.051 --> 44:42.214
But if you’re not convinced
that I’m invincible

44:42.388 --> 44:44.049
Put me to the test

44:44.390 --> 44:49.009
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest

44:49.103 --> 44:51.560
Go ahead and zap me
with the big surprise

44:51.689 --> 44:54.271
Slap me in a trap
Cut me down to size

44:54.358 --> 44:55.438
I’ll make a great escape

44:55.526 --> 44:56.891
It's just a piece of cake

44:56.986 --> 44:59.318
You're only second-rate

44:59.739 --> 45:02.321
You know, your hocus—pocus
isn't tough enough

45:02.408 --> 45:04.865
And your mumbo jumbo
doesn’t measure up

45:05.077 --> 45:06.283
Let me pontiﬁcate

45:06.370 --> 45:07.655
Upon your sorry state

45:07.747 --> 45:10.033
You're only second-rate

Alakazomnibus

45:19.300 --> 45:21.632
This thing's bigger than the both of us

45:21.719 --> 45:23.926
So spare me your tremendous scare

45:24.013 --> 45:26.254
You look horrendous
in your unden/vear

45:26.349 --> 45:29.011
And I can hardly wait
to discombobulate

45:29.101 --> 45:31.592
I'll send you back and packing
in a shipping crate

45:31.687 --> 45:34.269
You'll make a better living
with a spinning plate

45:34.357 --> 45:37.770
You're only second-rate

45:43.991 --> 45:46.607
Hello? Hello?

45:51.165 --> 45:53.121
That was invigorating.

45:53.376 --> 45:57.790
Come, Abis Mal,
we have other lives to ruin.

46:02.176 --> 46:06.010
Sultan, look, I'm sorry
for not telling you about Iago.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.586
(HUFFS)

46:08.015 --> 46:09.721
I guess I saw some good in him.

46:10.142 --> 46:13.009
Just like you saw some good
in a street rat.

46:14.730 --> 46:20.475
The good I saw in a...
Well, yes, I suppose.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.019
Well said, my boy.

46:23.281 --> 46:26.239
Oh, you'll be a fine vizier.

46:28.494 --> 46:34.990
-This was a great idea, Iago. Thanks.
-Oh, don't thank me. Really.

46:35.418 --> 46:36.828
(NEIGHING)

46:40.756 --> 46:41.745
(GASPS)

46:48.806 --> 46:49.841

46:52.435 --> 46:54.426
Aladdin! Stop!

46:55.563 --> 46:56.894
(COUGHING)

47:01.235 --> 47:02.691
You traitor!

47:02.987 --> 47:04.978
"Traitor" is such a strong word.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.357
SULTAN: Aladdin!

47:06.449 --> 47:07.905
Help!

47:09.201 --> 47:12.034
I'll settle with you later.
Come on, Carpet.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.113
Look, they're trapped on the cliff.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.199
When they stop, we'll... What?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.294
Abis Mal knows magic?

47:26.427 --> 47:27.416
Whoa!

47:32.933 --> 47:35.970
What? Get them! Get the sultan!

47:36.062 --> 47:38.553
Hang on, Sultan.
This is where we lose them.

47:50.493 --> 47:51.482
(SULTAN YELLS)

47:52.161 --> 47:54.743
Sultan! We have to go back, Carpet.

48:09.804 --> 48:10.793
(ABIS MAL LAUGHING)

48:15.893 --> 48:17.178
Yes!

48:17.311 --> 48:18.300
Wha?

48:20.356 --> 48:22.187
What are you doing?

48:39.333 --> 48:41.540
Are you nuts? You saved him!

48:41.752 --> 48:45.119
He was this close to being
a greasy little smear on the rocks.

48:45.214 --> 48:50.504
Look, you little...
I mean, my dear Abis Mal.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.084
If you remember the plan,

48:52.179 --> 48:55.637
it is not yet time
for the boy to meet his end.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.423
Um... I knew that.

48:57.518 --> 48:59.179
Soon our revenge will be complete,

48:59.270 --> 49:01.511
and you shall have your third wish.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.687
Oh, boy, the little wishy.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.105
And you, Iago,

49:05.860 --> 49:08.101
you have done well.

49:08.487 --> 49:11.069
Please, don't mention it.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.533
(COUGHS)

49:20.624 --> 49:23.741
Sultan! Iago.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.714
SULTAN: Jafar, you ﬁend!

49:30.801 --> 49:33.838
I should've known
that this was your treachery.

49:33.929 --> 49:37.217
But I couldn't have done it without Iago.

49:37.558 --> 49:38.593
Ugh!

49:38.684 --> 49:41.346
I played a minor role, really.

49:41.437 --> 49:45.476
Jafar! This rug won't cooperate!

49:54.283 --> 49:56.569
When Aladdin returns...

49:56.744 --> 50:01.204
I think we have ample time
to prepare for his arrival.

50:03.876 --> 50:07.835
Hey, that was a nice hat.
I could've worn that hat.

50:07.922 --> 50:10.208
We need this for our plan.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.756
Couldn't we use another hat
for the plan?

50:12.843 --> 50:15.926
Oh, no. The sultan's turban
and this dagger

50:16.013 --> 50:18.345
are exactly what we need

50:18.807 --> 50:22.095
to seal Aladdin 's doom.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.108
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

50:32.196 --> 50:35.108
-Razou|, the sultan's been...
-Seize him!

50:35.157 --> 50:38.615
You are under arrest
for the murder of the sultan.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.318
What? No!

50:42.706 --> 50:45.789
And then you went over
the waterfall, eh?

50:45.918 --> 50:46.953
Pah!

50:47.002 --> 50:48.117
How did you survive?

50:48.796 --> 50:51.287
I don't know.

50:51.715 --> 50:54.331
How very convenient.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.629
It's the truth!
Why won't you believe me?

50:56.720 --> 50:58.551
JASMINE: Because
we know you're lying.

50:59.390 --> 51:04.885
I found this in your room.
My father's turban, slashed.

-You can't think...
-I thought you loved me,

51:07.481 --> 51:10.564
but now I see that all you wanted to do
was rule Agrabah.

51:10.818 --> 51:13.400
-I never wanted...
-He shall die at dawn

51:13.487 --> 51:15.193
for the murder of my father.

51:19.326 --> 51:20.736
Jasmine, please!

51:20.828 --> 51:24.662
You're in my hands now, street rat!

51:35.217 --> 51:36.707

the look on Aladdin's face

when Princess Jasmine
sentenced him to death.

51:44.393 --> 51:46.258
-No!
-Oh, yes!

51:46.353 --> 51:47.843
And then I get my wish.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.179
Yes, and then you get your wish.

51:50.357 --> 51:54.020
Iago! I swear
one day you will pay for this.

51:55.029 --> 51:58.192
I really think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.359
Hmm, such spirit.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.317
Perhaps after a few days in chains,

52:03.370 --> 52:05.406
you'll be more kindly disposed
toward me.

52:05.539 --> 52:09.031
Especially if you want
your father to remain healthy.

52:09.918 --> 52:11.328
Ah, Iago!

52:12.212 --> 52:15.670
You betrayed me
and allied yourself with my enemies.

52:15.716 --> 52:19.254
And you turned on them
as soon as it was in your best interests.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.752
That's what I love about you.

52:21.889 --> 52:24.596
You're so perfectly predictable.

Oh, what does it look like I'm doing?

53:39.508 --> 53:46.471

Good to see you, too, Abu.

There's somebody else
who wants to talk to you.

Hello.

55:44.258 --> 55:45.418
You set me up!

How could you show your face?
You're nothing but a...

55:48.095 --> 55:50.507
Aladdin, Iago rescued us.

He didn't have to, but he did.

Rescued? Him?

Please note, "Did not have to, but did."

So this means I could have more stuff?

57:40.707 --> 57:42.993
Ooh! I always wanted one of those.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.996
Nice. More. More!

57:58.016 --> 57:59.381
Oh, dear.

58:01.895 --> 58:05.137
Now, if that's obscenely
excessive enough,

58:05.399 --> 58:08.732
perhaps you'd care
to grant my freedom.

58:09.069 --> 58:11.185
What? Oh, yeah. Right.
| wish you were free. Sure thing. Yeah.

58:14.241 --> 58:16.357
I wish for Jafar to be...

58:16.827 --> 58:18.192
Wait.

58:18.829 --> 58:23.243
How do I know that these things
won't disappear once I set you free?

58:23.667 --> 58:26.158
The more pressing question is,

58:26.253 --> 58:29.245
how will you stay alive if you don't?

58:29.923 --> 58:33.040
But you said genies can't kill.
You said that.

58:33.343 --> 58:36.756
You'd be surprised
what you can live through.

58:36.847 --> 58:37.836
What?

58:38.974 --> 58:40.009
Huh?

58:40.100 --> 58:41.840
-Hey!
-|'|| take that.

58:42.227 --> 58:43.763
My lamp. Give me that...

58:44.438 --> 58:46.599
The street rat, still alive?

58:47.024 --> 58:48.434
No!

58:54.322 --> 58:55.311
Ah!

59:03.540 --> 59:05.781
(SCREAMING)

59:10.756 --> 59:12.292
Thanks, Genie.

59:13.675 --> 59:14.960
Where's the lamp?

59:26.438 --> 59:28.429
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

59:34.488 --> 59:35.898
The lamp!

59:39.034 --> 59:40.114
Not so fast.

59:42.746 --> 59:43.906
Give it up, Jafar.

59:43.997 --> 59:46.204
We're obviously
too much for you to handle.

59:46.291 --> 59:49.408
You! You're a fool to Challenge me.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.829
I am all-powerful.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.289
Some all-powerful.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.841
You can't even get rid
of a lowly street rat.

59:58.136 --> 1:00:02.630
A problem I mean to rectify right now.

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:03.839
JASMINE: Aladdin!

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:07.008
(YELLS)

1:00:09.564 --> 1:00:11.020
-What?
-GotCha.

1:00:12.150 --> 1:00:13.390
Go, All

1:00:14.945 --> 1:00:16.060
Genie!

1:00:16.863 --> 1:00:18.023
Faster, Carpet.

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:27.449
Carpet, no!

1:00:30.377 --> 1:00:31.457
Aladdin!

1:00:38.552 --> 1:00:40.008
-Whoa!
-(LAUGH|NG)

1:00:50.397 --> 1:00:51.477
Genie, wake up.

1:01:03.410 --> 1:01:04.900
(ALADDIN YELLS)

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:22.216
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

1:01:22.804 --> 1:01:24.294
Give it up, boy!

1:01:28.143 --> 1:01:30.350
You shall never have my lamp.

1:01:30.437 --> 1:01:33.520
And there is no one
to save you this time.

1:01:33.607 --> 1:01:37.520
Hey, Jafar! Shut up!

1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:39.855
Iago?

1:01:40.322 --> 1:01:42.187
Traitor!

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:51.867
No!

1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:56.626
(JAFAR LAUGHS)

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:59.796
Good help is so hard to find these days.

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:01.673
Isn't it, Aladdin?

1:02:04.512 --> 1:02:05.501
(GASPS)

1:02:10.018 --> 1:02:11.007
(YELLS)

1:02:15.857 --> 1:02:16.892
Iago!

1:02:23.907 --> 1:02:25.738
(ROARS)

1:02:46.930 --> 1:02:47.919
(SCREAMS)

1:02:57.232 --> 1:02:58.688
(SCREAMS)

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:32.050
All right!

1:03:38.356 --> 1:03:39.516
Iago.

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:40.896
No.

1:03:47.157 --> 1:03:49.864
But I thought
a genie couldn't kill anyone.

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.232
(COUGHS)

1:03:52.287 --> 1:03:55.074
You'd be surprised
what you can live through.

1:03:57.167 --> 1:03:58.247
All right!

1:03:58.835 --> 1:03:59.995
Oh, Iago!

1:04:01.755 --> 1:04:03.916
He's alive!

1:04:07.886 --> 1:04:11.720
IAGO:
And so the bird lived happily ever after,

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:17.768
wallowing in luxury
as Aladdin's palace pal.

1:04:18.313 --> 1:04:23.307
Now, my dear boy.
Or should I say my new vizier?

1:04:23.485 --> 1:04:24.895
Oh, say it!

1:04:25.028 --> 1:04:27.610
Sultan, I'm very honored, but...

1:04:27.739 --> 1:04:31.652
But? What "but"?
"But" is such a strong word.

1:04:33.161 --> 1:04:34.492
Why, I ought to...

1:04:35.121 --> 1:04:36.406
I can't be your vizier.

1:04:36.748 --> 1:04:40.457
What?
Sultan, the boy's talking crazy talk.

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:41.828
Don't listen!

1:04:42.712 --> 1:04:45.670
-What more do you want?
-The world.

1:04:47.008 --> 1:04:50.421
Look, personally, I'm with you, kid,
but let's take it one step at a time.

1:04:53.181 --> 1:04:54.296
ALADDIN: I mean...

1:04:54.599 --> 1:04:56.009
I wanna see the world.

1:04:56.226 --> 1:04:57.762
l can'tjust stay in the palace.

1:04:57.852 --> 1:05:00.264
There's too much to do,
too much to see.

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:02.388
Hey, what about your girlfriend?

1:05:02.482 --> 1:05:07.977
Do you think that this lovely princess
is just gonna wait around here?

1:05:08.696 --> 1:05:10.357
| most certainly will not.

1:05:11.032 --> 1:05:12.238
There, you see?

1:05:12.367 --> 1:05:14.483
I'm going to see the world, too.

1:05:15.286 --> 1:05:18.528
Okay, that's it.
The madness is spreading.

1:05:18.998 --> 1:05:20.829
(SQUAWKS) Crazy talk.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:24.876
Why do I keep getting hooked up
with these warped people?

1:05:25.130 --> 1:05:29.794
Shouldn't somebody ask
what the brave parrot wants to do?

1:08:57.050 --> 1:08:59.211
Does this mean
I don't get my third wish?
