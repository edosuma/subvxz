ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - NSC ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ
(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

00:23.077 --> 00:24.943
In the criminal justice system,

00:24.943 --> 00:28.644
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.644 --> 00:29.912
In New York City,

00:29.912 --> 00:33.436
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.436 --> 00:36.462
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.462 --> 00:38.689
These are their stories.

00:40.393 --> 00:42.390
Morning, Maggie.

00:45.899 --> 00:48.215
Maggie, where's my coffee?

00:48.610 --> 00:50.127
Maggie?

00:53.453 --> 00:54.893
Maggie?

00:59.299 --> 01:01.097
Oh, my God.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.648
I...I need help.

01:20.243 --> 01:21.214
Two victims.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.187
Night manager, Margaret Sandomir.

01:23.187 --> 01:25.674
As far as we can tell,
she was raped and shot.

01:25.674 --> 01:27.337
John Doe was by the trash...

01:27.337 --> 01:30.291
stabbed several times in the back,
chest, and genitals.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.590
- He is on his way to Mercy.
- Who called it in?

01:32.590 --> 01:36.082
Alvin Maddox.
Works construction.

01:36.959 --> 01:38.555
Mr. Maddox?

01:38.771 --> 01:41.317
I'm Detective Benson.
How you holding up?

01:41.317 --> 01:44.946
I never did see a dead body in my life.

01:44.946 --> 01:47.936
I mean, not before an undertaker
got to them, you know.

01:47.936 --> 01:50.289
I'll try to make this as quick and
painless as possible.

01:50.289 --> 01:51.978
I just need you to tell me what you saw.

01:51.978 --> 01:56.245
I really didn't notice anything wrong
until I got to the coffee pot.

01:56.245 --> 01:57.960
There was none.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.949
Then I saw all the blood and
Maggie behind the counter.

02:02.531 --> 02:04.146
Who would do that?

02:04.146 --> 02:06.334
Everybody loved her.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.335
Did you know the other victim
who was found outside?

02:09.335 --> 02:13.666
I didn't even see the poor bastard at first.
Almost lost my breakfast.

02:13.882 --> 02:16.553
Mr. Maddox,
I'm gonna need your shoes.

02:16.712 --> 02:19.470
Oh, my God. I didn't...

02:19.646 --> 02:22.383
I wasn't... / I just need to
eliminate your footprints

02:22.383 --> 02:25.670
so I'll write you a receipt and we'll
return them to you when we're done.

02:25.670 --> 02:26.490
Are you kidding?

02:26.490 --> 02:28.729
Toss them or burn them.
I'll never wear them again.

02:28.729 --> 02:31.648
Okay, sit tight.
I'll have someone take you home.

02:41.221 --> 02:43.369
Body's been tampered with.

02:43.996 --> 02:48.280
Shot in the back, but laying face up
and the shoes are on the wrong feet.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.500
The M.E. Said
he found no trace of fluids

02:51.500 --> 02:54.462
so it looks like our guy wore a condom.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.453
So far, too much blood and
not enough forensics.

02:58.453 --> 03:00.530
Just what I like.
A smart predator.

03:00.530 --> 03:04.101
Okay, so we got two victims,
one shot, one stabbed.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.776
One inside, the other out on the street.

03:05.776 --> 03:07.789
But from the looks of it,
it all started in here.

03:07.789 --> 03:09.674
If he had a gun, why the knife?

03:09.674 --> 03:11.691
Something went wrong.

03:13.162 --> 03:15.788
Maybe we're looking for two perps.

03:58.949 --> 04:02.336
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/11/24

04:05.011 --> 04:07.664
Money was still in the drawer.
$200 and change.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.861
That's why we're thinking
it's a rape that got interrupted.

04:09.861 --> 04:12.138
- Surveillance camera?
- Non-functional for some time.

04:12.138 --> 04:13.760
It's not in a high crime area.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.591
The owner thought its presence
was deterrent enough.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.077
Well, who's our corpse?

04:18.077 --> 04:20.831
Margaret Sandomir, night manager.

04:20.831 --> 04:24.106
Works midnight to 6:00 a.m.
Beloved by all.

04:24.106 --> 04:26.479
Not entirely.
Has the family been notified?

04:26.479 --> 04:27.856
Mother took a sedative.

04:27.856 --> 04:29.731
Our second vic has no ID.

04:29.731 --> 04:32.357
Just a few dollars in his pocket
and a set of keys.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.935
So he's probably going
in for a midnight snack

04:34.935 --> 04:37.675
and winds up getting stabbed
in the chest and genitals instead.

04:37.675 --> 04:40.464
Focused or frenzied attack?

04:40.633 --> 04:43.313
Both. / Two different guys,
two different weapons

04:43.313 --> 04:46.030
so one was organized,
the other one out of control.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.835
What if we got one guy,
two weapons?

04:47.835 --> 04:49.523
Maybe he was in control and lost it

04:49.523 --> 04:51.659
when our second victim
interrupted his flow.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.039
I'll check the computer to see if

04:53.039 --> 04:55.694
they got any hits on perps
that like to carry both.

04:55.694 --> 04:59.934
Until our victim wakes up
to give us any pertinent information.

04:59.934 --> 05:03.412
Munch, Fin, knock on doors.
If he's local, let's try to ID the guy.

05:03.412 --> 05:08.534
Benson, Stabler, talk to the Sandomir family.
Get some background.

05:09.023 --> 05:11.883
Sandomir Residence
356 West 19th Street
Monday, November 13

05:11.883 --> 05:13.412
She was getting her Ph.D.

05:13.412 --> 05:16.470
In psychology at Columbia
during the day.

05:16.974 --> 05:20.737
We thought since the market was
just two blocks away that she'd be safe.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.847
It's our neighborhood.
Everybody knows her.

05:23.847 --> 05:27.766
Did she have any enemies?
Was there ever any trouble?

05:31.094 --> 05:34.495
She did have some difficulty with
one of the patients at the clinic

05:34.495 --> 05:36.610
but she assured me that
was taken care of.

05:36.610 --> 05:38.227
What patient was this?

05:38.227 --> 05:40.693
Maggie interned
at a mental health clinic twice a week.

05:40.693 --> 05:45.582
This man fantasized that he and
Maggie had a relationship.

05:45.582 --> 05:48.092
He stalked her.

05:48.292 --> 05:50.409
What's his name?

05:50.409 --> 05:52.551
Oh, I don't remember.

05:53.179 --> 05:54.735
There was a police report.

05:54.735 --> 05:58.508
Maggie assured me that
he wasn't dangerous.

05:58.508 --> 06:00.217
Do you have the name of the clinic?

06:00.217 --> 06:02.621
H.M.H. Clinic.

06:02.869 --> 06:05.576
Homeless Mental Health.

06:11.317 --> 06:13.212
Hi. / Hi. Can I help you?

06:13.212 --> 06:15.848
- Could I see Dr. Klein?
- She's in a session.

06:15.848 --> 06:16.909
Need about five minutes.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.829
She'll be done in 30.
So have a seat.

06:20.429 --> 06:22.494
Great.
Thank you.

06:23.426 --> 06:26.389
Guy stalking our victim
is Ben Moreland.

06:26.389 --> 06:27.920
She took out a restraining order.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.639
So much for him not being dangerous.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.773
You want to go and come back later?

06:32.661 --> 06:34.665
Let's have Munch take it.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.058
They pulled the 61 on Moreland.

06:51.058 --> 06:53.414
He was stalking our victim
for almost a month.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.528
Became agitated when
approached by uniforms.

06:55.528 --> 06:58.324
He had box cutters taped to his hands.
One cop almost got cut.

06:58.324 --> 06:59.272
When was this?

06:59.272 --> 07:00.805
- Two weeks ago.
- He at Rikers?

07:00.805 --> 07:02.059
Claims insanity.

07:02.059 --> 07:04.949
Said the Unis had laser beams for eyes
and were trying to fry him.

07:04.949 --> 07:07.678
The judge ordered him to take
his meds and sent him home.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.393
Address is West 54th Street.

07:09.393 --> 07:12.197
What are the odds
he's still not taking his pills?

07:15.255 --> 07:16.758
Hello?

07:17.030 --> 07:18.838
Ben Moreland?

07:27.842 --> 07:29.871
What's this about?

07:29.871 --> 07:31.976
Maggie Sandomir.

07:33.893 --> 07:37.311
I'm not allowed within 500 feet of her.

07:37.311 --> 07:39.825
Where were you last night?

07:40.839 --> 07:42.810
Right here. Why?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.992
Anyone with you?

07:45.883 --> 07:49.357
Just me and the four walls closing in.

07:50.061 --> 07:54.530
She say I was bothering her again?
Because I swear I wasn't.

07:54.530 --> 07:57.278
Miss Sandomir is dead.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.303
No.

08:01.312 --> 08:04.543
- I just talked to her.
- In person?

08:05.044 --> 08:07.122
She called me.

08:07.122 --> 08:11.643
Wanted to know how things were
going with the new shrink.

08:11.643 --> 08:14.335
She referred him.
She was always good to me.

08:14.335 --> 08:17.655
I guess that's why I'm fixated.

08:18.617 --> 08:23.179
She helped me get my disability
and get off the street.

08:23.179 --> 08:26.004
- Take my meds consistent.
- The court order helped, too.

08:26.004 --> 08:27.476
You still complying?

08:27.476 --> 08:29.263
I take Fluphenazine.

08:29.263 --> 08:35.712
Guess I'm supposed to live
with the drooling and the shakes.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.914
You're very talented.

08:40.475 --> 08:42.727
Only when I'm crazy.

08:43.474 --> 08:46.733
I haven't been able to work since
they forced me to take the medication.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.071
Is it helping?

08:48.071 --> 08:49.989
Depends.

08:50.849 --> 08:55.241
I'm not hearing voices telling me
to rip my own throat out.

08:55.241 --> 08:58.262
It's supposed to make me better,
so I can hold down a job.

08:58.262 --> 09:00.816
Who the hell's going to hire me like this?

09:00.816 --> 09:04.626
I don't work. I'm going to be out
on the street again.

09:06.477 --> 09:09.477
It's tragic,
what happened to Maggie.

09:09.689 --> 09:12.709
- Anything I can do?
- Yes, we need a list of her patients.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
Anything except that.

09:14.792 --> 09:17.187
Doctor, we understand you'd like to
protect their confidentiality

09:17.187 --> 09:18.991
but this is a rape-murder investigation.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.448
- That list won't help you.
- Why not?

09:21.448 --> 09:22.856
These people don't have addresses.

09:22.856 --> 09:24.670
They're scattered all over the city.

09:24.670 --> 09:28.425
Can we get the schedule of when they're
due to come in for their medication?

09:28.425 --> 09:31.135
So they can be traumatized
by the experience?

09:31.135 --> 09:33.871
I betray their trust,
they don't show the next time.

09:33.871 --> 09:36.490
It's hard enough to get them to
take their meds to begin with.

09:36.490 --> 09:37.746
We can get a court order.

09:37.746 --> 09:39.178
Then that's what you'll have to do.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.010
I'm not unsympathetic, just protective.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.355
And uncooperative.

09:43.355 --> 09:47.304
My patients suffer from manic depression
mood disorders, and schizophrenia.

09:47.304 --> 09:49.052
That doesn't make them killers.

09:49.052 --> 09:53.051
Yet there's an unbelievable stigma
when most of them are not violent.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.252
Doctor, are all of your patients
under control?

09:55.252 --> 09:57.762
If they take their meds and
work with their doctors, yes.

09:57.762 --> 09:59.543
And if they don't?

09:59.543 --> 10:02.587
Instead of hounding patients struggling
with their disease

10:02.587 --> 10:05.276
you should be checking
the subject of Maggie's thesis.

10:05.276 --> 10:06.499
Mark Nash.

10:06.499 --> 10:09.281
And why doesn't he fall
under your protective cover?

10:09.281 --> 10:11.341
Mark Nash was non-compliant.

10:11.341 --> 10:13.463
He refused to take medication.

10:13.463 --> 10:17.405
I absolutely believe
that medication and therapy

10:17.405 --> 10:20.940
give the best possible
relief for schizophrenia.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.209
Maggie advocated
a patient's right to choose.

10:24.209 --> 10:29.037
But how can a sick mind
even recognize that it's ill?

10:30.417 --> 10:33.565
Lab came back on our footprints.
Only three sets.

10:33.565 --> 10:36.324
The victim outside and
our witness, Maddox.

10:36.324 --> 10:39.029
Looks like we're looking for
only one perp.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.790
Nothing on Mark Nash.

10:40.790 --> 10:43.525
No complaints, no violence.
Nothing. Zip.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.125
First time for everything.

10:45.125 --> 10:48.392
So you think the guy goes from zero to rape
and murder because he's schizophrenic?

10:48.392 --> 10:50.395
If he's not in his right mind, hell, yes.

10:50.395 --> 10:53.319
And who is the arbiter of mental health?
Are you sane?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.658
And how do you know
if you're not unless somebody tells you?

10:55.658 --> 10:57.692
And how do they know they're not?

10:57.692 --> 10:59.696
What about Moreland?
He look good to you?

10:59.696 --> 11:01.492
Nothing so far.
He's got no alibi.

11:01.492 --> 11:03.666
But I don't see him going out
in that condition.

11:03.666 --> 11:06.981
He stalked her. If anybody's
seen him lately, we'll find out.

11:06.981 --> 11:10.896
Be hard to miss him with all
the facial twitches, tremors, and drool.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.516
Probably extra-pyramidal.

11:12.516 --> 11:16.439
I got Maggie Sandomir's thesis
from Dr. Klein.

11:16.439 --> 11:20.683
That sounds like the side effects you
get from long-term usage of anti-psychotics.

11:20.683 --> 11:23.862
You get involuntary muscle spasms
among other things.

11:23.862 --> 11:25.823
That's why a lot of them
refuse the medication.

11:25.823 --> 11:28.547
Right, but we can't possibly know
which ones are dangerous

11:28.547 --> 11:29.466
when they are gonna snap.

11:29.466 --> 11:31.859
That's why taking their meds
shouldn't be an option.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.098
You'd suppress an individual's right
to refuse medical treatment?

11:35.098 --> 11:37.176
For the public safety?
Absolutely.

11:37.176 --> 11:39.899
Our John Doe is out of
surgery and awake.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.634
So let's get his statement.
All right, keep me posted.

11:47.771 --> 11:49.400
How's he doing?
He still got all his parts?

11:49.400 --> 11:50.609
Can't this wait?

11:50.609 --> 11:52.968
And if he croaks in the next five minutes?

11:52.968 --> 11:54.797
He just came out of major surgery.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.531
We're trying to find out
who put him there.

11:56.531 --> 11:58.585
Don't worry, this'll be short and sweet.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.131
Sir.

12:00.617 --> 12:01.748
Yeah.

12:02.943 --> 12:04.434
What's your name?

12:04.434 --> 12:05.938
Miller.

12:06.323 --> 12:08.128
Earl Miller.

12:08.345 --> 12:10.631
Can we call anybody for you?

12:11.456 --> 12:12.873
No.

12:13.144 --> 12:15.685
Did you get a good look at
who did this to you?

12:18.735 --> 12:20.750
Slight...

12:20.750 --> 12:22.198
white...

12:22.371 --> 12:24.875
in 20s or 30s...

12:25.391 --> 12:27.612
brown hair...

12:29.239 --> 12:31.369
crazy.

12:31.369 --> 12:33.064
I saw him attack that woman.

12:33.064 --> 12:35.960
Crazy?
What, did he say something?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.347
Russian something.

12:37.347 --> 12:39.041
He spoke with an accent?

12:39.041 --> 12:40.930
No.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.159
Please.

12:58.594 --> 13:00.360
Mr. Nash?

13:03.474 --> 13:05.591
Mark Nash?

13:05.808 --> 13:08.446
"Raskolnikov..."

13:08.446 --> 13:10.122
"it was I..."

13:10.122 --> 13:13.604
"who killed the old pawnbroker woman
and her sister with an axe."

13:13.604 --> 13:15.433
Mr. Nash, I'm going to need
to see your hands.

13:15.433 --> 13:17.319
"317 rubles."

13:17.319 --> 13:19.429
- I need to see your hands.
- "60 kopecks."

13:19.429 --> 13:21.648
Mr. Nash, why don't you
stand up slowly?

13:21.648 --> 13:23.238
Show me your hands.

13:23.238 --> 13:25.251
Put your hands behind your head.

13:26.671 --> 13:28.036
Down.

13:29.336 --> 13:31.822
Mr. Nash, you're under arrest.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.795
- "I do not repent."
- That's great.

13:55.672 --> 13:59.597
Mark, we already know what happened,
so it's okay for you to tell us.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.054
You had an episode.

14:01.054 --> 14:02.808
You got all lost in your head, right?

14:02.808 --> 14:04.974
Did she say something
or do something that set you off?

14:04.974 --> 14:07.024
- Is that why you hit her?
- No. No. No. No.

14:07.024 --> 14:10.984
Mark, I tell you, you hit her so hard,
she came out of her shoes.

14:11.131 --> 14:13.585
You felt bad, so you tried to
put them back on her feet

14:13.585 --> 14:16.950
but you got them
on the wrong feet, is that right?

14:16.950 --> 14:20.410
"Razumihin, you think I'm mad?"

14:20.410 --> 14:21.863
"Have a drink.
You'll feel better."

14:21.863 --> 14:23.868
You've had enough for all of us.

14:23.868 --> 14:25.641
I can still smell the beer on you.

14:25.641 --> 14:27.535
You're not drunk, are you?

14:27.535 --> 14:29.222
Is Maggie dead?

14:29.222 --> 14:31.313
You know she is,
because you killed her.

14:31.313 --> 14:33.789
And then you stabbed a witness.
He might not make it.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.028
I hope he's dead.

14:35.028 --> 14:37.820
- So you did stab him?
- Yes.

14:43.315 --> 14:44.425
Mark.

14:46.124 --> 14:47.806
Just calm down.

14:47.806 --> 14:49.930
Mark, calm down, okay?

14:49.930 --> 14:53.341
We just want to help, so why don't you
sit down and we'll talk?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.492
We won't be getting
anything out of him for now.

15:03.492 --> 15:05.197
Not while he's delusional.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.916
Defense is going to ask for a 730.

15:06.916 --> 15:09.006
State Examiner will keep him
until he's fit for trial.

15:09.006 --> 15:12.741
Maybe we'll get his story instead of
Dostoyevsky's Crime And Punishment.

15:12.741 --> 15:16.069
We've got enough for the assault to
confine him to a state hospital.

15:16.069 --> 15:18.306
The blood on the knife
came back as Miller's.

15:18.306 --> 15:19.864
I'd like the gun to close it up tight.

15:19.864 --> 15:22.686
The M.E. Found two hairs on the body,
follicles intact,

15:22.686 --> 15:24.512
so maybe we don't need it.

15:24.512 --> 15:26.232
I never turn down evidence.

15:26.232 --> 15:29.524
Munch and Fin are talking to
Nash's mother in the interview room.

15:29.524 --> 15:33.612
Let's serve her the notice while
she's here, and then go toss the house.

15:34.638 --> 15:37.190
When he didn't come, I went looking.

15:37.190 --> 15:40.721
He didn't have his keys.
He loses them or forgets them.

15:40.721 --> 15:43.425
I went to the market.
It was closed.

15:43.425 --> 15:46.433
There was yellow crime scene tape
over it.

15:46.433 --> 15:49.660
I've been running everywhere
trying to find my son.

15:49.660 --> 15:53.618
In hospitals, police stations,
even the morgue.

15:53.618 --> 15:57.392
Now I'm here.
So, please, what did Mark do?

15:57.392 --> 15:59.214
Maggie Sandomir is dead.

15:59.214 --> 16:01.511
She was sexually assaulted
and shot in the back.

16:01.511 --> 16:02.447
Oh, my...

16:02.447 --> 16:05.062
Customer came in.
Wrong place, wrong time.

16:05.062 --> 16:08.436
He got stabbed for his trouble,
but he'll make it.

16:10.225 --> 16:11.694
My son isn't violent.

16:11.694 --> 16:16.622
Mrs. Nash, he took a knife out of his pocket,
and his clothes are stained in blood.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.496
This is impossible.

16:22.138 --> 16:24.496
He adores Maggie.

16:24.496 --> 16:28.384
He was so withdrawn,
and she took the time to reach him.

16:28.384 --> 16:30.832
They spent evenings together.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.411
Sometimes he helped her
in the market.

16:33.411 --> 16:35.099
They were close.

16:35.099 --> 16:38.346
As close as Mark can be.

16:38.346 --> 16:40.957
He would never hurt her.
Never.

16:40.957 --> 16:44.625
He refuses to take any medication.
Has he ever been on anything?

16:44.625 --> 16:47.833
Clozapine made
his white blood cells drop.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.132
Chlorpromazine made him sleep...

16:50.132 --> 16:53.500
18 out of 24 hours in a day.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.409
He refuses to try again.

16:55.409 --> 16:56.975
Does he drink?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.568
Yes.

16:58.568 --> 17:02.292
I never give him much money,
but he always manages to buy beer.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.406
Did he ever show any signs of violence?

17:04.406 --> 17:05.506
Never.

17:05.506 --> 17:06.890
Do you own a handgun?

17:06.890 --> 17:08.015
Yes.

17:08.015 --> 17:10.922
I understand if you're afraid of him.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.648
I bought that gun...

17:13.648 --> 17:17.548
to protect Mark against
the neighborhood ignorants.

17:17.548 --> 17:20.214
They chase him and frighten him.

17:20.214 --> 17:22.826
They're obsessed, terrified...

17:22.826 --> 17:26.685
that he'll freak out and hurt them
or their children.

17:26.685 --> 17:30.833
The media has done an excellent job
of demonizing schizophrenics

17:30.833 --> 17:35.553
so that when people look at my son
they don't see a human being.

17:35.553 --> 17:38.281
Mark doesn't scare me, Detective.

17:38.281 --> 17:42.335
Pathetic, narrow-minded people do.

17:46.431 --> 17:47.664
Ms. Cabot.

17:48.313 --> 17:50.345
Matt Wooding, counsel for Mark Nash.

17:50.345 --> 17:52.390
Alex Cabot for the People.

17:52.390 --> 17:54.209
Nice day for a walk in the park.

17:54.209 --> 17:56.604
Maybe. What are you offering?

17:56.604 --> 17:58.319
10 years in a state hospital.

17:58.319 --> 18:00.807
Court-monitored medication
compliance for the duration.

18:00.807 --> 18:04.138
That's a little stiff. Six inside,
remaining four on compliance.

18:04.138 --> 18:07.456
No. Have you seen
the crime scene photos?

18:08.479 --> 18:10.372
You've only got him
for Miller's assault.

18:10.372 --> 18:12.002
Last I checked,
he was still breathing.

18:12.002 --> 18:14.600
Just barely and now
he's missing a piece of action.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.235
Eight inside, five on compliance.

18:16.235 --> 18:18.670
But if I find the murder weapon,
the deal's off the table.

18:18.670 --> 18:22.643
You mean if you find a gun with
Mark's prints on it, don't you?

18:23.583 --> 18:25.990
I'll talk to the mother.

18:27.322 --> 18:29.741
Nash Residence
172 West 25th Street
Monday, November 13

18:29.741 --> 18:31.934
We're looking for a.38.

18:31.934 --> 18:37.173
Suspect's mother owns one,
so concentrate on her bedroom.

18:38.342 --> 18:40.691
I guess this is his corner.

18:41.884 --> 18:45.577
- He's got the right idea.
- It just seems nutty to me.

18:46.624 --> 18:49.541
You know, maybe it's his way of
making the shows more interesting.

18:49.541 --> 18:52.316
Maggie gave Mark Nash a chance,

18:52.316 --> 18:54.877
and it cost her, her life.

18:55.485 --> 18:58.129
Is that your reason for doing
what you did in the interview?

18:58.129 --> 19:00.351
- What did I do?
- Well, he was starting to talk.

19:00.351 --> 19:02.693
If we had just gone at him easy,
he would've come around.

19:02.693 --> 19:05.106
I asked the hard questions,
he confessed.

19:05.106 --> 19:07.372
They should all be that easy.

19:09.557 --> 19:12.398
Six months out of the Academy,
I worked a crime scene...

19:12.398 --> 19:15.690
where a schizophrenic hacked his father
to death and then he offed himself.

19:15.690 --> 19:17.734
Whole place was covered with blood.

19:17.734 --> 19:19.730
Turns out he stopped taking his meds.

19:19.730 --> 19:22.550
Look, Olivia, that is your experience
with one guy.

19:22.550 --> 19:25.342
Even shrinks can't predict their behavior.

19:25.342 --> 19:27.581
It's for their good that
they take their medication.

19:27.581 --> 19:29.926
Okay, what are we gonna do?
We gonna shove pills down their throats?

19:29.926 --> 19:31.384
If it will get the job done.

19:31.384 --> 19:32.742
You're uncomfortable
with the mentally ill.

19:32.742 --> 19:35.708
No, I am uncomfortable
with dangerous unpredictability.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.528
I found this in her lingerie drawer.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.849
Been fired recently?

19:43.909 --> 19:45.946
Arraignment Court Part 65
Wednesday, November 15

19:45.946 --> 19:47.802
"People versus Mark Nash."

19:47.802 --> 19:50.666
"The charges are one count murder
in the second degree"

19:50.666 --> 19:52.757
"one count of rape in the first degree"

19:52.757 --> 19:55.479
"one count assault in the first degree."

19:55.479 --> 19:56.523
How do you plead?

19:56.523 --> 19:57.498
Not guilty.

19:57.498 --> 19:59.835
Going for insanity.
What a surprise.

19:59.835 --> 20:01.315
Self-defense.

20:01.315 --> 20:02.951
Ms. Cabot?

20:03.526 --> 20:05.649
Your Honor, remand without bail.

20:05.649 --> 20:08.262
The defendant is a serious threat
to the community.

20:08.262 --> 20:11.288
We'd also like a psych evaluation to
determine mental competence.

20:11.288 --> 20:12.090
Objection.

20:12.090 --> 20:14.573
There's no reason to assess
the defendant's mental health.

20:14.573 --> 20:18.273
We will stipulate that he suffers from
paranoid schizophrenia.

20:18.273 --> 20:20.859
A debilitating disease,
but not an incapacitating one.

20:20.859 --> 20:23.893
The defendant raped and fatally
shot one victim known to him

20:23.893 --> 20:26.986
and severely maimed an innocent
bystander who interrupted his crime.

20:26.986 --> 20:29.256
I want to determine whether
or not his illness is a factor

20:29.256 --> 20:30.857
in the commission of these brutal crimes.

20:30.857 --> 20:33.801
The American Psychiatric Association
would strongly disagree

20:33.801 --> 20:35.826
with Ms. Cabot's narrow-minded
assumption

20:35.826 --> 20:38.933
that mental illness is always
a precursor to criminality.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.829
That's very P.C., Counselor but...

20:41.829 --> 20:45.961
let's just see what the members of
the A.P.A. Actually have to say about it.

20:45.961 --> 20:49.112
Remand without bail,
pending psychiatric evaluation.

20:49.112 --> 20:51.690
The defendant reserves
the right to refuse medication.

20:51.690 --> 20:53.066
So noted.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.299
Shouldn't have to take the poison.

21:02.299 --> 21:03.773
Already got cyanide in my head.

21:03.773 --> 21:05.503
Don't want any more.
It's in the water.

21:05.503 --> 21:07.928
- Mark.
- Agranulocytosis.

21:07.928 --> 21:09.993
Seizures, Tardive Dyskinesia...

21:09.993 --> 21:12.774
Akathisia, Dystonia, Torticollis...

21:12.774 --> 21:16.165
Hypotension, Parkinsonism.

21:16.165 --> 21:19.069
Those are side effects
of anti-psychotics.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.987
Mark, is the reason you
refuse medication

21:21.987 --> 21:25.352
that you prefer the world
you live in to reality?

21:25.352 --> 21:29.353
I'd be crazy if I didn't, wouldn't I?

21:31.139 --> 21:32.839
Don't look at me.

21:32.839 --> 21:33.790
Why not?

21:33.790 --> 21:37.091
Because you can see
the books in my head.

21:37.825 --> 21:39.297
What kind of books are they?

21:39.297 --> 21:41.499
Prognostication.

21:41.499 --> 21:45.754
I do it before I see it
and it's exactly like I saw it.

21:45.754 --> 21:49.142
What do you see?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.474
I see the safe.

21:55.406 --> 21:57.693
Do you understand
what happened to Maggie?

21:57.693 --> 21:58.790
Maggie died.

21:58.790 --> 22:01.684
- She was murdered.
- I know that. She was raped, too.

22:01.684 --> 22:03.082
Yes.

22:05.368 --> 22:07.356
Ugly.

22:07.601 --> 22:09.319
What is?

22:09.965 --> 22:12.689
How I feel about my mother.
Maggie understood...

22:12.689 --> 22:16.570
that my hatred stemmed from
a matriarchal obsession with Christ.

22:16.570 --> 22:19.901
I focus not on the crucified but...

22:19.901 --> 22:22.750
on the suffering of his mother.

22:22.933 --> 22:25.174
Did you study psychology?

22:25.864 --> 22:27.275
Of course.

22:27.801 --> 22:29.938
Sociology, theology...

22:29.938 --> 22:31.553
pathology...

22:31.553 --> 22:33.505
I'm an autodidact.

22:33.505 --> 22:36.036
I sometimes hate my mother.

22:36.414 --> 22:39.550
If it weren't for her great suffering...

22:39.841 --> 22:42.223
then I could end all this.

22:43.156 --> 22:46.660
Do you remember exactly
what happened to Maggie?

22:48.114 --> 22:49.718
The safe.

22:49.718 --> 22:53.410
The combination to the safe
is needed to get within it.

22:53.410 --> 22:56.960
My life is in the safe,
and the keys are needed to get within.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.470
Where is the safe?

22:58.470 --> 23:01.736
Below the floor. In hell.

23:03.781 --> 23:08.209
I dream of angels,
but I live with demons.

23:13.946 --> 23:16.434
Miller IDed the loon out of
the photo array.

23:16.434 --> 23:17.652
Words have power, Fin.

23:17.652 --> 23:20.423
Keep up the bad karma
I see the Alzheimer's in your future.

23:20.423 --> 23:23.471
At least I won't remember
how great I used to be.

23:24.023 --> 23:24.905
What did I miss?

23:24.905 --> 23:27.378
Ben Moreland's prints were found
at the crime scene.

23:27.378 --> 23:31.170
And according to DNA, the hairs found
on Maggie Sandomir's body...

23:31.170 --> 23:33.154
are not Mark Nash's.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.911
I can let you have that real cheap.

23:43.911 --> 23:45.756
It's not yours to sell.

23:45.756 --> 23:48.642
Mr. Moreland is three months
behind in his rent.

23:48.642 --> 23:50.880
There's an eviction process.
It's the law.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.507
I followed every step.

23:52.507 --> 23:54.727
Furniture's mine and so is the art.

23:54.727 --> 23:57.786
Moreland signed an agreement
before I put him out.

23:57.786 --> 24:00.635
He said it was like Picasso
paying for his meals.

24:00.635 --> 24:02.986
- Any idea where he went?
- No.

24:03.248 --> 24:05.497
I can let you have that for $50.

24:05.497 --> 24:08.083
Take it inside or
I'm gonna have to fine you.

24:12.156 --> 24:15.064
I haven't seen Ben Moreland
since the situation with Maggie.

24:15.064 --> 24:16.416
We found him a new clinic.

24:16.416 --> 24:19.302
- Have you checked with them?
- They haven't seen him in two weeks.

24:19.302 --> 24:21.934
And it wasn't a situation.
He was stalking her.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.301
I don't have time for this.

24:23.301 --> 24:25.453
I have a lot of patients waiting
to see me.

24:25.453 --> 24:27.611
I suggest you cancel
the rest of your schedule

24:27.611 --> 24:30.497
because you're going to be
in lock-up for the duration.

24:30.497 --> 24:31.638
On what charge?

24:31.638 --> 24:34.691
Aiding and abetting a prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

24:34.691 --> 24:37.146
Now look, Doctor...

24:37.146 --> 24:40.919
we're not asking you to
reveal privileged information here.

24:40.919 --> 24:44.198
Look, if Moreland was coming
to you for his meds

24:44.198 --> 24:46.296
then that means he was
homeless at the time.

24:46.296 --> 24:49.943
So why don't you just tell us
where he liked to hang out?

24:49.943 --> 24:52.203
Try the Shepherd's Flock Shelter.

24:52.203 --> 24:55.184
They used to let him draw on the walls.

24:56.659 --> 24:58.806
I think we should check out
the psych wards also.

24:58.806 --> 25:00.194
Stabler.

25:01.289 --> 25:03.094
When did that happen?

25:03.580 --> 25:05.242
Thanks a lot.

25:05.464 --> 25:07.258
Ben Moreland's in the tombs.

25:07.258 --> 25:10.043
- What for?
- Destruction of private property.

25:10.967 --> 25:14.372
You lied to us when you said
you hadn't seen Maggie.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.481
No, I didn't.

25:16.481 --> 25:19.521
We found your fingerprints in the market.

25:21.858 --> 25:25.181
I lied to the other detectives,
I didn't lie to you.

25:25.181 --> 25:27.673
Did you kill Maggie Sandomir?

25:32.199 --> 25:34.072
I did.

25:34.425 --> 25:38.752
I'd like to do my time at Creedmoor.

25:38.937 --> 25:41.740
Just tell us what happened first.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.368
I went to talk to Maggie.

25:45.368 --> 25:49.128
I wanted her to tell that quack
she sent me to change my meds.

25:49.128 --> 25:52.856
She told me to leave
before she had to call the cops.

25:53.055 --> 25:56.656
- Traitor.
- That must have made you angry.

25:57.465 --> 25:58.715
Sure.

25:58.715 --> 26:01.572
Is that when you stabbed her?

26:05.242 --> 26:10.238
And then I hit her and she fell down.

26:10.997 --> 26:13.219
And then I kicked her.

26:14.285 --> 26:16.439
Twice.

26:17.156 --> 26:19.545
Then what?

26:22.485 --> 26:26.190
Ben, how did you kill Maggie?

26:26.860 --> 26:29.492
You don't know?

26:33.828 --> 26:37.282
You know, they have
an art studio there.

26:37.282 --> 26:40.366
- It's part of the therapy.
- What is?

26:40.617 --> 26:42.636
Painting.

26:42.898 --> 26:46.392
I could probably have my own wall.

26:47.942 --> 26:50.160
Take a blood sample to
match against the hairs.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.310
If it comes back negative,
cut him loose.

26:52.310 --> 26:56.155
We are now down to zero suspects.
Any thoughts?

26:56.155 --> 26:58.196
We haven't looked at Miller.

26:58.438 --> 27:00.459
You think our second victim's the doer?

27:00.459 --> 27:02.258
He's got no ID.

27:02.258 --> 27:04.334
But wait, he just recently
moved here, right?

27:04.334 --> 27:06.189
From New Hampshire.
They never heard of him either.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.537
An alias?

27:07.537 --> 27:09.535
No hits on NCIC.

27:09.535 --> 27:10.970
Granted it looks suspicious,

27:10.970 --> 27:14.589
but I hope there's another reason
to turn the screws on one of our victims.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.563
How about why that market
when his address is 20 blocks away?

27:17.563 --> 27:19.777
I mean, that's a hell of
a hump for a midnight snack.

27:19.777 --> 27:23.375
When we asked, he said he was
on his way home from visiting a friend.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.956
This friend have a name?

27:27.990 --> 27:29.350
Oh, God.

27:29.722 --> 27:33.038
I wonder when I can have
solid food again.

27:33.642 --> 27:36.023
So, what can I do for you?

27:36.023 --> 27:37.527
Just want to go over your statement.

27:37.527 --> 27:39.037
Want to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

27:39.037 --> 27:42.518
Now you told detectives
you were coming home

27:42.518 --> 27:44.727
- from a friend's house, is that correct?
- That's right.

27:44.727 --> 27:46.556
And the friend's name?

27:46.556 --> 27:48.568
Why? / Depending on the D.A.,

27:48.568 --> 27:51.653
they might want to call your friend in to
testify as to what time you went home.

27:51.653 --> 27:53.783
I thought it was a no-brainer.

27:53.783 --> 27:57.705
I heard the guy was found
with the knife in his pocket

27:57.705 --> 27:59.009
and my blood on his clothes.

27:59.009 --> 28:03.446
Just give us his name, Mr. Miller,
and we'll get out of your hair.

28:04.841 --> 28:09.627
The thing is,
I wasn't with a friend, actually.

28:09.627 --> 28:11.654
I was with a pro.

28:11.654 --> 28:14.360
Oh, okay. Her place?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.398
- Her car.
- And her name?

28:18.134 --> 28:21.233
Why would I want to know that?

28:25.426 --> 28:26.454
Thanks.

28:29.099 --> 28:30.402
Changing his story.

28:30.402 --> 28:32.596
A prostitute in that neighborhood
with a car?

28:32.596 --> 28:34.671
- You notice his eating habits?
- It's convict posture.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.965
It's pretty hard to shake.

28:37.276 --> 28:38.633
Excuse me, miss.

28:38.633 --> 28:39.937
Yes?

28:40.392 --> 28:41.926
Can you go into Mr. Miller's room,

28:41.926 --> 28:44.274
and remove his food tray
but don't touch anything on it?

28:44.274 --> 28:46.390
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

28:46.390 --> 28:49.517
Earl Miller's prints belong to Earl Gilmore.

28:49.517 --> 28:53.100
Did a seven-out-of-twelve-year stretch
in Sing Sing for armed robbery.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.181
So maybe he goes in to steal...

28:55.181 --> 28:56.574
but he does Maggie instead...

28:56.574 --> 28:59.196
Nash is the witness,
he sees the attack on his friend

28:59.196 --> 29:00.807
grabs the knife and shreds his stem.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.420
- In his mind, poetic justice.
- In anybody's mind.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.825
Any sex offense charges that
didn't hold up?

29:05.825 --> 29:06.647
Not one.

29:06.647 --> 29:09.735
Seven years in Sing Sing could change
anybody into a sexual predator

29:09.735 --> 29:11.444
and make them smart
enough to know that

29:11.444 --> 29:13.753
DNA can nail you
if you don't use a condom.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.836
We run Gilmore's blood
from the crime scene

29:15.836 --> 29:17.789
we'll get a DNA match,
I guarantee it.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.269
It's a chain of evidence issue.
Check with Cabot.

29:20.269 --> 29:22.851
If it's a match, it might be
enough for probable cause.

29:22.851 --> 29:25.828
Munch, Fin, head up to
Ossining and get his prison file.

29:25.828 --> 29:27.765
Can't they send it?

29:28.239 --> 29:32.480
And while you're there, talk to anybody
who recalls the ex-con's reputation.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.840
Some incidents just
don't make it into the file.

29:36.288 --> 29:39.783
Sing Sing Correctional Facility
Ossining, New York
Monday, November 20

29:39.783 --> 29:41.785
Earl Gilmore's file.

29:42.002 --> 29:44.339
All you had to do is make a phone call.

29:44.339 --> 29:45.738
I'd have sent it over immediately.

29:45.738 --> 29:48.393
Truth is we wanted
a drive in the country.

29:48.393 --> 29:50.421
Gilmore cause any problems?

29:50.421 --> 29:51.960
The usual disruptions.

29:51.960 --> 29:55.051
Nothing serious, or we'd have
flagged him before parole.

29:55.051 --> 29:58.185
Which guards were assigned to
Gilmore's cellblock?

29:58.185 --> 29:59.168
Why?

29:59.168 --> 30:02.167
We'd like to talk to them and
get some background on the prisoner.

30:02.167 --> 30:05.661
Best people to do that are the ones
that eyeballed him every day.

30:05.661 --> 30:07.794
I don't think that's necessary.

30:07.794 --> 30:10.565
All the information you need is in that file.

30:10.849 --> 30:12.943
Now, if you'll excuse me.

30:14.618 --> 30:17.892
I haven't seen tap dancing like that
since Bring In 'Da Noise.

30:17.892 --> 30:18.893
He's protecting his flank.

30:18.893 --> 30:21.498
He wants no appearance that
they paroled a convict

30:21.498 --> 30:24.894
with violent tendencies back into
the unsuspecting population.

30:24.894 --> 30:27.231
It says right here
the shift changes at four.

30:27.231 --> 30:29.538
Guard named Wheeler comes on then.
You want to wait?

30:29.538 --> 30:30.803
Why him?

30:30.803 --> 30:32.646
He filed most of the petty complaints.

30:32.646 --> 30:35.035
He might've objected to
the hump's early release.

30:35.035 --> 30:37.046
You suppose we can get
a home address on Wheeler?

30:37.046 --> 30:40.351
I'll wait right here while
you go back and ask.

30:43.303 --> 30:44.988
Gary Wheeler?

30:47.576 --> 30:49.110
You Wheeler?

30:50.518 --> 30:54.344
Yeah. / You remember
an ex-con named Earl Gilmore?

30:55.075 --> 30:58.080
Got out last year.
Should've done the whole bit.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.004
Why you say that?
Was he a hard ass?

31:00.004 --> 31:04.170
When he rotated in, he had the usual bluster
right up until lights out.

31:04.170 --> 31:07.205
His cell mate initiated him
into life at Sing Sing.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.514
How bad was that?

31:08.514 --> 31:11.534
Fourteen stitches and
a week in the infirmary. / Ouch.

31:11.534 --> 31:14.721
It went from bad to worse
till Gilmore decided to pump up.

31:14.721 --> 31:17.742
Smuggled in steroids instead
of the regular contraband.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.126
Steroids made him more aggressive?

31:19.126 --> 31:20.911
And strong as hell.

31:20.911 --> 31:25.302
He never once lifted a finger against
the guards but when the new meat arrived,

31:25.302 --> 31:28.409
he was on it like a hungry dog.

31:29.241 --> 31:31.550
Blood matches the hairs.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.342
But don't arrest him yet.

31:33.342 --> 31:34.490
Why not?

31:34.490 --> 31:36.590
It's all circumstantial.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.983
I don't have the murder weapon and

31:37.983 --> 31:40.424
I need a credible witness
to charge him with rape.

31:40.424 --> 31:42.866
- Mark Nash is a witness.
- I said credible.

31:42.866 --> 31:44.324
He's psychotic.

31:44.324 --> 31:48.331
Even if I wanted to I couldn't instruct
a jury to disregard his delusions.

31:48.331 --> 31:51.456
So you're saying you can't
win with what we've given you.

31:51.456 --> 31:53.588
You ever hear of reasonable doubt?

31:53.588 --> 31:55.059
I need the gun.

31:55.726 --> 31:58.067
Fast Stop Market
648 West 23rd Street
Monday, November 20

31:58.067 --> 32:00.482
This is exactly where
Gilmore was found.

32:00.482 --> 32:02.554
I don't see him getting
very far in his condition.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.981
He's laying here, he slips the gun in
with the rest of the garbage.

32:04.981 --> 32:06.128
He's home free.

32:06.128 --> 32:08.725
Wait a minute, there was
more garbage here before.

32:08.725 --> 32:11.700
Yeah. Trash is collected
every Wednesday, if we're lucky.

32:11.700 --> 32:14.460
That was last week?
What company do you use?

32:14.460 --> 32:16.192
Hell if I know.

32:16.662 --> 32:20.103
Lassiter. Lassiter Sanitation.

32:21.177 --> 32:24.237
Is it possible to pinpoint exactly
where it is now?

32:24.237 --> 32:27.459
Sure. Each truck carries
22 tons of garbage.

32:27.459 --> 32:30.084
It takes 70, 80 trucks to fill a barge.

32:30.084 --> 32:31.761
- Sounds like we're wasting our time.
- Trust me.

32:31.761 --> 32:33.598
Whatever you're looking for,
we'll find it.

32:33.598 --> 32:36.727
Look, even with 800 tons
of garbage in a barge

32:36.727 --> 32:39.692
I know exactly where each of
my trucks are off-loaded.

32:39.692 --> 32:43.594
We'll just cart it to Staten Island,
have the Hazmat guys sift through it.

32:43.594 --> 32:45.922
- When did we do the pickup?
- Last Wednesday.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.439
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

32:48.586 --> 32:50.178
Why not?
Where's the barge now?

32:50.178 --> 32:53.718
Somewhere down river,
on its way to Virginia.

33:06.984 --> 33:09.945
You cannot force Mr. Nash
to take anti-psychotics.

33:09.945 --> 33:11.198
He has rights.

33:11.198 --> 33:14.144
One of those rights is the right
to refuse medication.

33:14.144 --> 33:17.441
Isn't there any way to use
the assault charge to force him?

33:17.441 --> 33:19.978
He exhibited a violent reaction
against someone.

33:19.978 --> 33:22.366
Doesn't that constitute a danger
to himself and others?

33:22.366 --> 33:24.603
Until I can prove it, no.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.995
He hasn't been convicted of anything.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.127
What about his mother?

33:28.127 --> 33:29.627
His mother has instructed their attorney

33:29.627 --> 33:32.696
that under no circumstances is
her son to receive medication.

33:32.696 --> 33:35.281
She's certain it's his wish,
and she's adamant about it.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.107
Then we're out of options.

33:37.107 --> 33:41.369
Gilmore walks on murder, and
the witness goes to jail for knifing him.

33:42.552 --> 33:44.257
Rikers...

33:44.257 --> 33:47.492
can't be all that comfortable for Mr. Nash.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.048
I can't imagine it's fun for anybody.
Why?

33:50.048 --> 33:54.841
The general population wouldn't
be sensitive to his disease.

33:54.973 --> 33:58.240
You want me to cut him a deal
so he can go home.

33:59.692 --> 34:03.055
In order to prove self-defense your client
has to testify on his own behalf

34:03.055 --> 34:05.128
and I don't see him doing that
without medication.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.392
You have a suspect.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.958
Earl Gilmore, ex-con, out on parole.

34:08.958 --> 34:12.034
He went up once for armed robbery.
That's why he went in that market.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.692
There was no money missing,
so it's just conjecture...

34:14.692 --> 34:17.867
unless I get a lucid statement
from your client saying otherwise.

34:17.867 --> 34:20.616
- My client refuses medication.
- Then he's going to prison.

34:20.616 --> 34:22.878
I've got him cold for assault one.

34:22.878 --> 34:24.726
What are you selling, Ms. Cabot?

34:24.726 --> 34:29.491
I'll rule it justifiable in exchange
for a statement about the entire event.

34:29.491 --> 34:32.536
You want him on medication.

34:33.643 --> 34:36.523
An injection of an anti-psychotic
that'll last about a month.

34:36.523 --> 34:37.422
Risks?

34:37.422 --> 34:41.768
Without psychiatric care, Mr. Nash
will be ill equipped to deal with reality.

34:41.768 --> 34:44.353
And any medication carries
the risk of side effects.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.781
Why such a long-acting injection?

34:46.781 --> 34:49.471
If I need Mr. Nash for trial,
he's medicated.

34:49.471 --> 34:52.056
If I get a confession from Gilmore,
the drug will wear off

34:52.056 --> 34:55.996
and he could go back to his psychosis
if that's what he still wants.

34:55.996 --> 34:58.178
No. No.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.075
No.

35:00.774 --> 35:03.648
I think you just got your answer.

35:14.177 --> 35:17.700
Who did that to your face, Mr. Nash?

35:21.345 --> 35:23.195
Would you like to go home?

35:23.195 --> 35:26.409
Yes. I want to go home.

35:27.569 --> 35:32.937
You have to agree to take your medication,
or you have to stay here.

35:40.308 --> 35:43.170
I'll take the medication.

36:01.143 --> 36:03.769
I'd rather talk to you guys anyway.

36:03.769 --> 36:06.451
Gonna do a lineup or something?

36:06.451 --> 36:08.852
No, you picked him out of the photos.
No question.

36:08.852 --> 36:10.890
That guy shanked you.

36:11.032 --> 36:12.243
But he tells a different story,

36:12.243 --> 36:16.065
so we were wondering if you wanted
to amend your statement.

36:17.196 --> 36:20.042
You're going to listen to
a nut job over me?

36:20.042 --> 36:23.445
You said when you entered the store
you didn't see anything right away,
is that correct?

36:23.445 --> 36:25.413
- Yeah.
- You went to get a six-pack.

36:25.413 --> 36:28.574
That's when you see the guy behind
the counter over the victim, right?

36:28.574 --> 36:30.430
That's what I told you.

36:30.430 --> 36:33.045
So why didn't he just shoot you?

36:33.358 --> 36:35.099
He came after me.

36:35.099 --> 36:37.712
I ran, ducking between the aisles.

36:37.712 --> 36:40.400
Maybe he couldn't get a shot off.
I don't know.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.041
Is that when he stabbed you
in the back? / Yeah.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.765
Hurt like a bitch, too.

36:44.765 --> 36:46.130
- You buy that?
- Yeah.

36:46.130 --> 36:49.126
What if you're our perp?
You get stabbed, there's a big struggle.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.578
Somehow you manage to escape.

36:50.578 --> 36:53.022
You've lost a lot of blood
you collapse, crawl to the street

36:53.022 --> 36:56.775
because you've got to get rid of the gun
put it in the trash, that was smart.

36:56.775 --> 36:58.810
I don't know, Munch.
If I'm Gilmore and I got a gun...

36:58.810 --> 37:01.170
why don't I just shoot the guy
with the knife?

37:01.170 --> 37:02.714
He thinks he's alone.

37:02.714 --> 37:04.599
Clerk's dead,
so he put the gun in his pocket

37:04.599 --> 37:08.125
but when he got attacked he couldn't
get to it, fending off knife blows from behind.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.659
How's that sound?

37:09.659 --> 37:11.740
I want a lawyer.

37:16.982 --> 37:20.856
- Don't give my son anything.
- Mrs. Nash, he agreed to this.

37:20.856 --> 37:22.295
Because you forced him.

37:22.295 --> 37:24.435
You already know what happened
in the market that night.

37:24.435 --> 37:26.181
Mark's done nothing wrong.

37:26.181 --> 37:27.374
Why are you doing this?

37:27.374 --> 37:29.599
Ma'am, because he is
the witness to Maggie's death.

37:29.599 --> 37:31.733
We can't make our case without him.

37:31.733 --> 37:33.748
So you treat him like a criminal.

37:33.748 --> 37:35.330
You never asked him.

37:35.330 --> 37:39.310
You hold a gun to his head and you
have the audacity to say that he agreed.

37:39.310 --> 37:41.741
Prison or this.

37:44.576 --> 37:47.275
Mark, you don't have to do this...

37:47.275 --> 37:49.795
Mom. / I'll figure something out.

37:49.795 --> 37:54.120
They told me... / I will find a way
to keep you out of jail.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.409
I can't go back.

37:55.409 --> 37:57.773
The bars.
There's microwaves in the bars,

37:57.773 --> 37:59.849
so they can read your mind.

37:59.849 --> 38:01.949
They put razors in the food.
I spit up blood.

38:01.949 --> 38:03.100
He signed an agreement.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.705
He didn't know what he was doing.

38:05.705 --> 38:10.200
You would have to get a competency
hearing to supersede his rights.

38:12.027 --> 38:15.655
Months. It would take months.

38:16.091 --> 38:17.948
I talked to Maggie.

38:17.948 --> 38:20.639
She told me she wanted to die.

38:20.803 --> 38:22.552
You cut me!

38:44.295 --> 38:46.301
Show me your cards.

38:46.301 --> 38:49.866
Seven years in prison
turned your client into a sexual predator.

38:49.866 --> 38:52.035
Really? How do you prove it?

38:52.035 --> 38:55.716
I find and put every man
he raped in prison on the stand.

38:55.716 --> 38:57.712
Not without making a lot of deals.

38:57.712 --> 38:59.614
I don't think the public
would appreciate it.

38:59.614 --> 39:01.531
- Next?
- He was at the scene.

39:01.531 --> 39:03.846
He likes to shop there. So what?

39:03.846 --> 39:06.545
So I've got a potential witness.

39:06.739 --> 39:08.168
And what else?

39:08.168 --> 39:10.166
- DNA.
- Not possible.

39:10.166 --> 39:12.267
Your client is a very stupid man.

39:12.267 --> 39:15.728
Who you calling stupid,
you scum-sucking bitch?

39:17.502 --> 39:19.198
Plead to life now...

39:19.198 --> 39:21.501
or wait for my witness's statement

39:21.501 --> 39:25.206
and end up with a potassium
chloride cocktail.

39:27.988 --> 39:30.136
Ten minutes.

39:31.143 --> 39:35.039
Do you remember
what happened that night?

39:37.131 --> 39:39.583
Maggie was killed.

39:40.956 --> 39:44.344
Did you see anyone enter the market?

39:45.348 --> 39:47.162
No.

39:47.657 --> 39:50.754
I usually stayed in the cold case.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.576
I like beer.

39:55.029 --> 39:58.079
I heard a loud pop.

39:58.266 --> 40:00.831
That's when I saw the guy.

40:00.831 --> 40:04.002
He was standing over Maggie.

40:05.360 --> 40:09.782
Her pants were down,
but she wasn't moving.

40:10.373 --> 40:13.144
Did you see him rape her?

40:13.144 --> 40:14.653
No.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.903
But I know he did it.

40:18.441 --> 40:22.904
He was exposed.

40:25.196 --> 40:28.489
He was searching through
her pockets...

40:28.489 --> 40:31.553
Iooking for the keys to the safe.

40:31.553 --> 40:34.046
Where's the safe?

40:34.046 --> 40:37.540
It's in the floor behind the counter.

40:37.796 --> 40:40.502
I didn't know if Maggie was still alive.

40:40.502 --> 40:43.960
That's when I grabbed the knife
and stabbed him.

40:44.248 --> 40:47.039
Did he have a gun?

40:47.039 --> 40:49.999
I saw the bulge.
It was in his pocket.

40:51.430 --> 40:57.083
He lifted his hands to fight me
so I stabbed him lower.

40:57.933 --> 41:02.741
When he went down, I went to Maggie.
I didn't see him leave.

41:05.398 --> 41:07.210
Mark...

41:08.007 --> 41:11.726
was Maggie already dead?

41:15.815 --> 41:18.858
I couldn't let anyone see her like that.

41:18.858 --> 41:21.718
I know she wouldn't have liked it.

41:22.694 --> 41:25.903
So I did what I could...

41:26.067 --> 41:28.854
and then I had to get away.

41:30.163 --> 41:32.364
Why didn't you call the police?
Why didn't you wait?

41:32.364 --> 41:34.458
For what?

41:34.458 --> 41:36.890
My friend was dead.

41:37.775 --> 41:40.483
He did that to her...

41:40.483 --> 41:43.402
and she didn't yell for me.

41:44.801 --> 41:47.448
While he brutalized her...

41:47.448 --> 41:50.205
threatened her with a gun...

41:50.373 --> 41:53.352
she didn't make a sound.

41:54.226 --> 41:56.741
Not once.

42:03.668 --> 42:04.814
Deal's off the table.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.328
Your client's headed for death row.

42:06.328 --> 42:07.943
That's up to a jury.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.922
For my sake and yours,
don't talk to anybody.

42:10.922 --> 42:12.563
Please stand up.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.593
What's going on?

42:13.593 --> 42:15.622
See you in court.

42:16.161 --> 42:20.699
Earl Gilmore you are charged with the murder
and rape of Maggie Sandomir.

42:27.009 --> 42:29.591
When I said I'd have dinner with you,
I thought we might be sitting.

42:29.591 --> 42:31.495
We'll sit in the car.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.452
- You're a classy guy, you know that?
- Yes, I am.

42:33.452 --> 42:35.882
Yeah, I do. You know something?

42:35.882 --> 42:36.794
I'm paying for it.

42:36.794 --> 42:39.673
It's on me, don't worry.
Stabler.

42:42.997 --> 42:44.864
- Be right there.
- What?

42:44.864 --> 42:47.133
Here. Let's go to the hospital.

42:50.744 --> 42:53.649
I'm Dr. Warner.
You the SVU detectives?

42:53.649 --> 42:56.769
Yeah, Stabler. This is Benson.
What happened?

42:56.769 --> 42:59.177
Strangulation.

42:59.908 --> 43:02.757
Belt around the neck
and hospital bed post.

43:02.757 --> 43:04.653
He asphyxiated.

43:04.653 --> 43:06.819
Very effective.

43:09.737 --> 43:13.012
Why would he...

43:13.012 --> 43:14.193
The meds made him lucid.

43:14.193 --> 43:16.851
But with the voices gone,
so were his friends.

43:16.851 --> 43:20.766
Loneliness led to depression
and then to suicide.

43:20.766 --> 43:24.738
You can't face a reality
you're not used to living in.

43:25.772 --> 43:27.795
His parents been contacted?

43:27.795 --> 43:31.156
His mother's coming down
to ID the body.

43:48.828 --> 43:51.200
Mrs. Nash...

43:52.369 --> 43:54.833
I'm so sorry.

43:57.336 --> 43:59.417
Go to hell.
