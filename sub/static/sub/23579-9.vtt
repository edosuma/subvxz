WEBVTT

00:45.211 --> 00:46.963
I know what happened to Bancroft.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.384
This pardon is extensively thorough.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.013
-I'm autonetic, not deaf.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.973
You discovered the truth,
whatever that may be,

00:57.057 --> 01:00.685
after enlisting all of us
in an elaborate ruse that required,

01:00.769 --> 01:03.271
among other things,
that I kill a fellow AI.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.691
Whom you hated and was trying
to make Lizzie into a sex slave.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.943
I like to think
that would have ended poorly for him,

01:09.027 --> 01:12.155
or anyone else
who would harm Ms. Elizabeth again.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.116
Kristin, pick up.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.166
I think your relationship with honesty
is passing at best.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.168
-Elliot, pick up.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.171
I believe the Elliots went for dinner.
I recommended a place nearby.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.965
There's still tension
between the two of them.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.718
Kristin, call me back.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.762
Why isn't she answering?

01:35.845 --> 01:37.639
Perhaps because
the last time you saw her,

01:37.722 --> 01:39.849
you told her you cared for another woman. It's purely conjecture, of course.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.865
Killing your sister. A bunch.

02:09.921 --> 02:13.174
What kind of sick person
uses the sleeve of a kid?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.385
I don't know what the hell
you were thinking.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.932
-She's got backups. Fail-safes.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.227
She's gonna be putting herself
back together.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.437
You make her sound superhuman.

02:33.903 --> 02:39.534
I thought by aiding Mr. Kovacs...
I would help us all feel safe.

02:39.617 --> 02:45.165
Instead, I'm finding
violence seems to beget violence.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.791
It's called fighting back.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.626
I believed I was helping you.

02:49.294 --> 02:53.214
I worry if I've shown you the right path.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.674
It was the only path.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.678
I go out on the Array sometimes by myself.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.183
Just look and listen and find things out.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.896
You spy on people? I collate data.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.525
It makes a web inside my head.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.696
Spiders can spin webs
that cover whole trees.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.365
But they have a signal line,
a single thread they touch,

03:19.449 --> 03:22.160
and they know what's happening
anywhere in their web.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.871
They can even feel vibrations
if something is about to hit the silk

03:24.954 --> 03:26.414
before it even happens.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.084
Lizzie, I don't understand.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.336
You will.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.964
I have to practice. It's almost time.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.432
She's gonna be coming back for you.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.232
You didn't think to mention that
before you sent me to kill her clones?

03:53.483 --> 03:54.734
Before I what?

03:56.319 --> 04:00.531
Yeah. Outside of Psychasec.
I know what you really meant.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.492
What are you talking about?

04:02.575 --> 04:08.581
Maybe you didn't say it explicitly, but it
was clearly what you wanted me to do.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.375
I was trying to protect you.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.918
I know.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.548
I also know what else you meant, too.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.466
No, I didn't--

04:18.549 --> 04:21.219
Oh, come on, Kovacs.
You always mean something else.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.264
Do you want to give me a straight answer
for a change?

04:27.767 --> 04:28.935
Do you love me?

04:33.106 --> 04:36.567
-It's not a complicated question.
-Everything about this is complicated.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.361
Yes or no. Is that simple enough?

04:40.238 --> 04:41.823
Why're you playing games?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.076
Maybe I like games.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.543
What did you do with her?

04:55.211 --> 04:58.506
I told you, I killed all of her clones.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.426
-Ow! Ow!

05:01.509 --> 05:03.344
-Ow, you're hurting me.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.312
That took you way too long, Tak.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.440
What gave it away?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.442
What did you do with her, Rei?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.862
I can see what you like about this sleeve.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.906
It's...

05:26.617 --> 05:28.745
-nice.

05:28.828 --> 05:33.082
Relax. When you've lived long enough,
you'll get it.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.378
There are no rules. We do what we want.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.838
Is she still alive?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.887
People still argue,

05:46.637 --> 05:49.307
"Is DHF the human soul?"

05:50.433 --> 05:52.310
Well, if it is, I've got hers.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.603
Is she alive?

05:55.813 --> 05:57.732
Yes, fine. She's alive.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.444
Although she shouldn't be,
after what she pulled.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.658
I'm sorry, Tak.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.745
I should have trusted you.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.209
This was fun, wasn't it?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.672
At least now I know I don't need to deal
with both of you. Just her.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.927
-Take the money Bancroft paid me.
-That's not the kind of coin I require.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.513
Blood was taken from me. Blood is owed.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.723
Whose blood?

06:35.895 --> 06:39.065
<i>Leung. Now he believes in souls.</i>

06:39.732 --> 06:40.566
Collects them.

06:42.610 --> 06:46.781
He's a bit of a zealot.
But he understands respect.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.908
Whose blood?

06:48.991 --> 06:51.869
Careful.
Remember whose sleeve you're bruising.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.581
You tell him to back off.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.837
I won't let anything
come between us again.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.967
Ortega messed with my family,
so I'm going to take hers.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.012
No.

07:10.096 --> 07:14.684
Let go of all these fireflies, Tak.
If you don't, I'll do it for you.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.727
I'll burn every one of them down,

07:16.811 --> 07:19.230
if that's what it takes
to bring you back to me.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.164
Xalbador Ortega?

07:37.748 --> 07:39.125
Yes. What is it?

07:40.084 --> 07:41.210
Are you a believer?

07:42.587 --> 07:46.799
Uh, I am, friend.
Are you here from the church?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.885
Father Huerta said
someone might be coming by.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.094
May I come in?

08:11.532 --> 08:15.745
Come to the kitchen!
I made cookies!

08:15.828 --> 08:17.371
Are you a believer?

08:20.875 --> 08:24.504
Hail Mary, full of Grace,
the Lord is with thee...

08:25.379 --> 08:28.466
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is...

08:28.549 --> 08:32.845
<i>Pray for us now... </i>

08:45.441 --> 08:47.527
<i>There they are. Let's move!</i>

08:59.455 --> 09:00.873
Hey, what the fuck?

09:46.127 --> 09:49.964
<i>♪ You can run on for a long time ♪</i>

09:50.047 --> 09:53.217

11:05.581 --> 11:08.417
You called sooner than I expected.
It's only been a day.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.759
Should I know who that is?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.766
Hell of a loose end
when the police lost Mary Lou's body.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.230
Then it shows up without a stack.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.025
If you don't want her...

11:42.535 --> 11:45.830
She worked for you.
But she was never Neo-C.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.207
That's all you figured out?
I'm a little disappointed.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.875
You found a way to fake religious coding. Okay, less disappointed.

11:53.796 --> 11:58.175
You recruited street whores.
Secretly recoded them, served them up.

12:00.219 --> 12:04.432
And if they die... they stay silent.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.644
Now I might even be impressed.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.276
So how many lives have you taken?
How much blood's on your hands?

12:15.901 --> 12:19.572
Girls like Mary Lou are only a small part
of the services I provide.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.451
I built an empire
that spans the Settled Worlds

12:23.534 --> 12:25.161
and I did it for us.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.831
You keep your empire. I'm leaving.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.920
I'm going on a little island vacation
and then I'm casting off this rock. I'm...

12:37.506 --> 12:38.632
I'm done.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.474
When we played, I'd always win.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.979
Pretending not to care won't work on me.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.025
What about Ortega? I gave her to Leung.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.361
Not quite sure what he's doing with her,
probably something in virtual.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.656
I don't care about her.
I don't care about you.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.743
I don't care about anyone.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.538
Please.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.458
You left me once.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.969
I didn't have any photos of her. Of us.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.348
Remember what Mom used to say?

13:29.308 --> 13:32.102
"I love you so much, I could eat you up."

13:33.229 --> 13:37.441
When you were arrested,
they put me in an orphanage.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.153
All I had left of you
was one of your old shirts.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.490
When the yakuza came,
they said I couldn't take anything.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.991
I fought them.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.370
They ripped that shirt out of my hands.

13:49.954 --> 13:54.250
I can still feel it tearing,
the threads still in my fingers,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.835
and I knew they were gonna take those too.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.714
So I swallowed them.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.969
Just to have something, anything,
left of you.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.689
It's in the past.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.400
Doesn't matter.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.741
You're the only person
who knows me as I was.

14:29.201 --> 14:33.581
The sister I remember... she was kind.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.667
I can't save you.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.087
I can't save anyone. I'm done trying.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.181
Abandon all the rest of them,
turn your back. That's fine.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.059
They deserve it. But not me.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.063
You'll come back.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.650
Follow him.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.009
Hello, Takeshi<i>-san.</i>

15:43.692 --> 15:45.277
There he goes.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.792
There I go.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.343
<i>I'll burn every one of them down,</i>

16:09.426 --> 16:11.929
<i>if that's what it takes</i>
<i>to bring you back to me.</i>

16:12.388 --> 16:14.306
-Shit.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.892
Poe, give me the address
of that restaurant.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.815
I barely understand
what Lizzie's turning into.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.488
But I can't stop thinking
about those men.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.034
What they... What they did to her...

16:35.327 --> 16:36.787
Men like Bancroft...

16:38.372 --> 16:42.710
It makes me...
It makes me wanna kill someone.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.969
I can't ever expect your forgiveness.
Or hers.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.680
We both left her.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.191
Vernon, what happened?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.113
Someone broke her mind.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.617
I'm not sure who, but...

17:16.744 --> 17:19.204
-We are getting her back.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.207
Ava, she's coming back.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.878
And we're gonna be together again,
in the real.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.344
We gotta go. Now.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.399
I thought you were dead.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.944
You should keep your fucking ONIs on.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.197
-We were having a private conversation.
Why would we be dead?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.658
Look, Ortega went after my sister.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.410
Reileen's got her
and I thought she'd come after you.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.290
Oh.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.377
I'm guessing you heard.
It's all over the precinct.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.546
Everybody's running scared.
I'm running scared.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.549
I'm feeling singularly uncharitable
toward strangers at the moment.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.801
I recommend you vacate the premises.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.599
Immediately.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.477
Let's hear what he's got to say.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.571
I told Ortega to get out of my office.
I told her I wouldn't help her anymore.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.741
And now I don't know where she is.
I don't even know if she's alive.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.370
Her whole family.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.040
No one's gonna do anything.
Tanaka's not gonna do anything.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.128
I finished the trace program.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.463
Tanaka doesn't know,
but I tracked the Ghostwalker.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.466
-I know where he is.

19:37.759 --> 19:42.014
His name is Leung. He works for Reileen.
He's got Ortega.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.476
We got the target. What's the run?

19:46.935 --> 19:49.354
I'll need a tac-op workstation
installed in my room.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.899
Wait. Where are you going?

19:54.359 --> 19:57.196
-You need to get the fuck outta here.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.280
I just got here.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.700
I mean out of Bay City.
You need to pack up and leave.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.368
Leave

20:03.452 --> 20:05.162
Put her around your neck.
Take her with you.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.163
And go where?

20:06.246 --> 20:10.167
Far away from here as possible.
You get them new IDs. I'm buying.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.753
Wait a second.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.339
-I need to get my birth sleeve back.
-I have responsibilities.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.841
I'm going after my sister.
I can't be worrying about you.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.177
And I need your identity code tag.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.641
Here. Why did you say you needed it?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.434
I'm gonna break into the evidence lockup

20:27.517 --> 20:28.810
-and steal some shit.
-No.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.647
That's a security violation.
I'll lose my job.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.648
Kovacs, wait.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.525
When I get back, you better be gone.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.504
Wake up.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.429
Let me out.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.597
Let me out, bitch!

21:05.681 --> 21:08.392
You wanted to take my brother
away from me.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.898
I killed the last woman who did that.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.151
You're going to spend some time
with Mr. Leung in VR.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.612
Pay for your sins.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.284
And I want you to know
I told Tak I have you.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.119
And he doesn't care.

21:31.331 --> 21:36.211
Let me out! Let me out! Let me ou--

21:45.554 --> 21:48.223
Sir, I believe the Elliots
would like to speak with you.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.892
I told you. Get them new IDs
and get them out of here.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.603
-Just fucking do it.
-And, of course, let no one in your room.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.147
Yeah.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.123
What the fuck?

22:13.206 --> 22:14.624
You didn't answer.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.335
I did not let Mr. Elliot in.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.171
Oh, let me guess. We're not friends.
You don't care about me.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.380
Something like that?

22:20.464 --> 22:23.467
All this is because of me.
That's why I gotta fix it alone.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.551
Here we go again.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.053
Whoa. Is that... Did you grow a...

22:28.680 --> 22:30.932
Just get the fuck out of here.

22:31.016 --> 22:31.892
Microwire cam.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.935
Schematics for Head in the Clouds.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.066
The whole ship is comm-jammed,
conventional tech.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.609
But these rooms here...

22:41.568 --> 22:43.195
That's a military-level dark field

22:43.278 --> 22:45.614
and it opens like clockwork
every 24 hours,

22:45.697 --> 22:48.116
just long enough
for a DHF backup to cast out.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.494
I bet that's Reileen's quarters.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.871
Why do you care? I don't care about you.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.581
That's what we Envoys do.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.042
We make neat little rows of friends
wherever we go,

22:57.125 --> 22:59.795
and then line up behind the cannon fodder
and watch you die.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.713
We're friends?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.299
Not really enough of us for cannon fodder.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.884
Do you really think you can solo

23:05.967 --> 23:08.136
a full DHF copy and download
without defrag?

23:08.220 --> 23:11.807
This microwire camera needs
to be installed surgically in your eye.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.228
You got a lot to lose. I don't.
Why don't you listen?

23:18.355 --> 23:21.274
You gave me my daughter back.
And my wife.

23:21.358 --> 23:25.403
You helped my daughter and my husband
when no one else would.

23:25.487 --> 23:29.157
I want Ortega back.
If this bitch has her, she's going down.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.076
This fight is not just yours anymore.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.248
Doing a double sleeve
requires a DHF copy transfer.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.127
Conscious mind-cloning.
It's... gonna hurt.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.096
This is weird.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.640
It's about to get weirder.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.935
I don't know how that's possible.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.312
We got a decision to make.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.455
You trying to get drunk?

24:16.913 --> 24:19.124
I don't see the point
in going through this sober.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.543
Just like to believe
I'd beat you fair and square.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.545
Fair is for dead men and losers.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.922
I know what you're thinking.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.427
All the shit that you've done,
you should get to go on the suicide run,

24:30.510 --> 24:32.804
and I go on vacation on orgy island.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.807
You can throw the game.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.144
You can't throw the game.
That's the point of the game.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.687
Don't try to guilt me.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.191
I'm you. I see what you're doing.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.862
-Trying to throw the game.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.615
Two out of three?

24:52.199 --> 24:53.283
Three out of five.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.299
There he goes.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.854
There I go.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.900
So, you won and he gets to go
to the tropical sex paradise?

25:26.983 --> 25:28.401
I won the right to decide.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.987
And technically,
he hasn't had sex yet, so...

25:31.071 --> 25:32.072
seemed fair.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.591
Do you remember me?

25:52.509 --> 25:55.136
You're Tak. You came to find me before.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.557
Thanks for bringing me here
and getting rid of the rats.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.267
I'm glad I could help.

26:02.811 --> 26:06.439
I'm going away for a while
and I wanted to come and say goodbye.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.442
You can say it later,
when one of us is dead.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.405
Can't remember if it's you or me.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.074
No one's gonna die, Lizzie.

26:18.702 --> 26:22.664
They said Cassandra of Troy was insane,
but she just remembered things backwards.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.502
She fell asleep in the temple
and snakes went into her ears.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.014
That worm. Have you seen it before?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.057
They used them to drive me mad,

26:41.141 --> 26:44.436
to make me quiet, to close my mouth.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.603
But I'm not quiet now.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.399
Where
The Wei Clinic?

26:49.691 --> 26:50.942
I'm going to miss this throw.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.320
Lizzie, I need you to tell me.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.532
See?

26:58.491 --> 27:00.577
I'm going down
the wrong side of the street.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.829
I won't talk about this anymore.
You have to go.

27:03.830 --> 27:04.956
Goodbye.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.666
Or is it hello?

27:09.210 --> 27:11.129
It's hard to keep them straight.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.216
I'll see you soon.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.304
I know.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.808
You've done this before, right?

27:26.102 --> 27:28.605
Would it make you feel better
if I lied and said yes?

27:29.648 --> 27:32.359
Wanna tell me what you wanna do
with a microwire camera?

27:33.860 --> 27:36.863
Gonna make her confess.
She's gotta pay for what she's done.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.117
Hmm. And that's gonna help how?

27:41.201 --> 27:44.079
She'll lose her backups, the money, power.

27:45.288 --> 27:48.708
Wake up in a century or two,
maybe be a human again.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.796
It's the only shot I have at saving her.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.631
What if that doesn't work?

27:57.634 --> 28:03.098
Reileen's next backup is in exactly
3 hours, 47 minutes and 12 seconds.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.519
This antenna is slaved to the frequency.
But it has to be within one meter of her

28:07.602 --> 28:09.938
-when her backup starts.
-So I gotta get close.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.732
Window of opportunity is seconds.
Hell of a needle you're trying to thread.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.275
What about heat sensors?

28:14.359 --> 28:16.569
All guests are given a thermal tag.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.364
Any untagged body temperature
is gonna set off the alarms.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.157
I can spoof you an all-access tag,

28:21.241 --> 28:23.493
but only if I can get into the system
from onboard.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.371
-No problem. I got that.
-Head in the Clouds only serves Meths.

28:26.454 --> 28:30.959
Mickey and I constructed Mr. Elliot's
upgraded military identity as a general,

28:31.042 --> 28:32.836
and we purchased
the most expensive package,

28:33.545 --> 28:35.463
the Iridium Experience.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.050
However, it requires
that you have completed

28:39.134 --> 28:40.927
several introductory sessions.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.597
-Doesn't matter. You're not gonna do it.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.890
Damn straight he's not.

28:45.974 --> 28:50.019
So, we smuggle you onboard,
I avoid some freaky Meth sex thing,

28:50.103 --> 28:52.522
and get Mickey into the tag system,
then get out. Got it.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.528
I'll piggyback on their grids,
hack their signal for our comms

28:58.611 --> 29:00.321
until you get into Reileen's stateroom.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.283
Once you go through those doors,
we lose contact with you.

29:03.366 --> 29:06.453
-Your ONI won't stream, nothing.
-Except for the microwire cam.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.622
<i>Yes. It's self-contained, </i>
<i>no uplink, couple hours of storage. </i>

29:09.706 --> 29:11.291
<i>But you'll have to get the cam</i>
<i>off the ship</i>

29:11.374 --> 29:12.834
for us to retrieve the recording.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.503
Any good news?

29:31.519 --> 29:32.353
Okay.

29:32.437 --> 29:36.107
-Five by five.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.526
<i> <i>Ava, do you read me?</i>
-Yeah, I can hear you fine.</i>

29:38.610 --> 29:40.111
You're supposed to say "five by five."

29:40.195 --> 29:41.988
Oh, no. I just ruined the mission.

29:42.071 --> 29:47.327
Hon, turn left to bearing 223
and descend towards docking bay three.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.862
Reileen's backup
is T-minus 17 minutes and counting.

30:22.946 --> 30:23.863
Copy that.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.977
Welcome, General, to Head in the Clouds.

31:07.907 --> 31:11.703
I'm certain the general will find
everything to his satisfaction.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.788
<i>This floor is entirely yours.</i>

31:13.872 --> 31:15.498
Doorway, end of the hall.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.459
<i>Leads to an access panel</i>
<i>to get Mickey into the system. </i>

31:18.543 --> 31:21.087
<i>That's how we'll get Kovacs </i>
<i>past the heat sensors.</i>

31:22.380 --> 31:25.216
We offer your fantasies...

31:27.176 --> 31:31.097
but you... make them real.

31:41.399 --> 31:44.986
So, General,
are you ready to fire your gun?

31:46.821 --> 31:49.032
Vernon, dose her and go.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.327
How old are you?

31:52.911 --> 31:56.789
Don't worry. I'm not some
old hag resleeved into this.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.669
This is my flesh. All 19 years of me.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.380
But if you don't wanna take me first...

32:06.466 --> 32:07.800
I guess we can get right to it.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.720
Get right to what?

32:12.096 --> 32:16.476
<i>Iridium Experience. I'm all yours.</i>

32:16.559 --> 32:17.852
Vernon?

32:17.936 --> 32:18.978
Fuck.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.688
Is that what you want

32:23.691 --> 32:24.692
Then you can...

32:26.861 --> 32:28.780
You could cut holes in me anywhere.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.658
Fuck me in them.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.661
Tear me apart, General.

32:34.744 --> 32:38.247
<i>Rip me open with that big dick.</i>

32:42.502 --> 32:43.586
Huh?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.547
Do you want me to scream

32:47.340 --> 32:48.341
Beg?

32:49.300 --> 32:52.053
Please. Please, don't. Please.

32:52.136 --> 32:56.975
<i>Please. Please, don't. </i>
<i>Please. Please. Please. Please.</i>

32:57.058 --> 32:58.893
Head in the Clouds runs girls
as snuff whores?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.353
<i>Kovacs, did you know?</i>

33:00.436 --> 33:04.023
Reileen told me she provides a lot
of services. I didn't ask for details.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.025
-This is not what I want.
No. What?

33:06.818 --> 33:07.902
This is not what I want.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.531
Uh, what? I'm not coded or anything.
Really.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.324
-No. No.
-It's... It's okay.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.743
-No. It's not okay.
-They're gonna resleeve me.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.120
<i>Really, it's okay.</i> No, it's not okay.

33:19.038 --> 33:22.500
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
They said it'll ruin the fantasy.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.712
Did I ruin the fantasy?

33:27.630 --> 33:30.216
Oh, God. Oh, no.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.301
Oh...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.724
How many times have you done this?

33:43.229 --> 33:44.564
It's my first.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.026
Do you know of any other girls
that come back?

33:49.777 --> 33:53.114
Well, turnover's pretty high and...

33:53.740 --> 33:57.452
we don't, you know, socialize.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.204
But you have to kill me.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.498
If you don't, they're gonna fire me.
Please.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.250
<i>Please.</i>

34:04.542 --> 34:07.670
You want a drink? I need a drink.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.840
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.182
That's why you have to qualify.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.518
They must put the johns
through virtual first,

34:22.602 --> 34:26.272
because the ones that come sniffing back
will pay anything for the real thing.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.779
Killing a girl who doesn't know
that she'll never come back.

34:44.791 --> 34:45.958
Oh.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.961
Oh.

34:49.962 --> 34:50.797
Take it easy.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.424
Thanks.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.511
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.305
Okay. It's okay.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.520
It's okay.

35:06.020 --> 35:10.066
Honey, we are gonna shut
this whole place down. Okay?

35:12.193 --> 35:16.322
You're never gonna have to do
anything like this again. I promise.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.123
Clock's ticking.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.458
<i>10:27 to backup and counting.</i>

35:29.001 --> 35:30.586
<i>Vernon, we need to hurry.</i>

35:31.462 --> 35:32.588
I'm on my way.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.764
<i>Access panel's across</i>
<i>the corridor to your right.</i>

35:47.395 --> 35:48.271
Okay, I'm in.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.773
Swipe the sub-menu docking bay three,
go into the tag file.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.775
Docking bay. Tag file.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.323
Real death'd every person in the building.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.783
Slagged the fucking receptionist.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.578
I was just lucky I was late for my shift.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.829
What's that?

36:07.623 --> 36:11.669
-Okay. So, a little issue here.
-Shit.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.254
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>
-Fuck.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.964
<i>Shit. It's not letting me in.</i>

36:15.047 --> 36:17.133
-Worst backup ever.
-Hold on, man. I got this.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.759
<i>You must exit the car immediately.</i>

36:18.843 --> 36:21.220
<i>He'll set off the heat sensors.</i>
<i><i> Vernon, you tap into</i></i>

36:21.304 --> 36:23.389
<i>the security subset</i>
<i>of docking bay three's power loop?</i>

36:23.472 --> 36:26.017
<i>Working on it.</i>
<i>We do not have time for this.</i>

36:26.100 --> 36:28.728
<i>I think I said </i>
<i>I was working on it. </i>

37:08.309 --> 37:09.227
Kovacs, you okay?

37:09.310 --> 37:12.355
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>
-Please tell me you saved the antenna.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.065
Yeah.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.360
Why are the alarms not going off?

37:18.402 --> 37:22.198
It's Reaper on the blade.
Lowered my body temp to fool the sensors.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.992
Did he just say Reaper?
Is he gonna pass out?

37:25.076 --> 37:26.994
Mr. Kovacs has a singular force of will.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.287
What does that mean?

37:28.371 --> 37:30.373
He's a suicidal idiot who never gives up.

37:32.875 --> 37:33.918
Sir? Are you--

37:34.001 --> 37:37.630
Oh, I was looking for you.
I had a fantastic time. Outstanding.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.384
I hope the general's experience
was as satisfactory as it was quick?

37:41.884 --> 37:44.720
Oh, I see you took a souvenir
to remember the occasion.

37:45.137 --> 37:48.599
Maybe we could find you
another young lady?

37:49.809 --> 37:50.977
Or a man?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.354
Or perhaps a child?

37:53.437 --> 37:54.730
Oh, my God.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.484
I think it's time I was going.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.581
<i>Three minutes, 23 seconds to backup.</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:18.129
Wait, where are you going?

38:18.212 --> 38:20.756
<i>Take the starboard service corridor. </i>
<i>There are no guards there.</i>

38:20.840 --> 38:22.133
This way is faster.

38:23.342 --> 38:25.928
<i> Gotta risk it. Not enough time.</i>

38:37.189 --> 38:39.400
<i>One minute, 38 seconds to backup.</i>

38:41.193 --> 38:43.863
<i>Kovacs, can you hear me? </i>
<i>Kovacs, can you hear me?</i>

38:55.207 --> 38:56.167
Can you hear me?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.439
<i>Kovacs, can you hear me?</i>

39:18.522 --> 39:20.358
Fifty-seven seconds to backup.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.942
<i>Kovacs, are you there?</i>

39:22.026 --> 39:23.444
God damn it. What's wrong?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.448
Sir, please.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.327
Your pleasure is my only concern.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.788
All you need is to tell me
what you want to do.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.669
That.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.505
Mickey, I need a fix on him.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.465
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

39:47.802 --> 39:48.969
Kovacs, what's wrong?

39:49.845 --> 39:52.681
<i> Thirty-two seconds to backup.</i>

39:52.765 --> 39:56.352
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just the fucking Reaper.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.690
Ten seconds to backup.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.150
I got it! I got it!

40:07.196 --> 40:08.489
Three...

40:09.532 --> 40:10.783
two...

40:12.159 --> 40:13.828
Make me proud, baby. Go to work.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.287
One.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.612
Shit. Fuck, we're down!

40:49.572 --> 40:53.742
It's some kind of counter-intrusion surge.
We're shut out of the system completely.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.078
-We're blind.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.874
Did you have enough time to get in?

41:02.543 --> 41:03.711
-Fuck, yeah.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.384
That's made for killing livestock.
Not a lot of range.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.178
I can make it work.

41:12.761 --> 41:17.725
It was all a trick. Not caring.
And I bought it.

41:18.517 --> 41:19.810
And who is that with Miriam?

41:23.397 --> 41:24.607
You double-sleeved.

41:27.818 --> 41:31.655
And you lied to me. To me, Tak.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.367
The only person
who's ever truly loved you.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.578
And you did it for her?

41:38.662 --> 41:39.747
-Jesus.
-Wait.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.040
Leung's in there with her.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.459
If we pull her out,
he'll know something's wrong.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.503
Nice try.

41:48.964 --> 41:52.092
It was so much better
when we were on the same side.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.470
No outsiders getting in your head.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.015
Which one's this again?

41:58.098 --> 41:59.767
Let me shoot her. Please.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.228
Oh, it's Elliot.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.193
Honestly,
all grounders look alike to me.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.402
Must be the film of dirt.

42:10.486 --> 42:13.948
You may wanna reconsider insulting the guy
with a bolt gun pointed at your head.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.991
Aren't you forgetting something?

42:16.075 --> 42:19.703
Kill me here and I'll be resleeved
from my last backup, which just happened.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.747
So it doesn't matter what you do.

42:21.830 --> 42:25.000
I'll come back
and I'll remember you were here.

42:26.418 --> 42:29.713
If you'd really walked away,
they would have all lived.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.508
But now, I'm coming
for your pathetic little pack

42:32.591 --> 42:34.468
and they're all going into virtual
for years.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.386
Shut up.

42:35.469 --> 42:37.388
Gonna watch Ortega
eat her own fucking eyeballs!

42:37.471 --> 42:39.473
I said shut up.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.767
I had Ava spike your backup with Rawling.

42:42.810 --> 42:43.644
No.

42:50.359 --> 42:52.820
You don't have access to stackpox.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.947
I stole the Envoy stacks,
Ava stitched the virus.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.907
Your backups are gone.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.828
Jimmy de Soto says hello.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.789
Tak, you wouldn't.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.669
You got one life left
and you're wearing it.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.255
Why are you doing this?

43:13.173 --> 43:17.553
'Cause I saw my sister for a moment.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.972
And I'm gonna get her back.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.517
You never lost me, Tak.

43:28.814 --> 43:29.898
A full confession.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.694
Bancroft, 653, Mary Lou Henchy, all of it.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.989
No one will believe you.

43:39.783 --> 43:40.659
Microwire cam.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.247
Tell me everything. It's your only chance.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.749
Chance to what?

43:48.917 --> 43:50.294
Become a human again.

43:51.378 --> 43:52.379
Tak.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.799
You wouldn't let them put me on ice, Tak.

43:59.011 --> 43:59.928
Please.

44:06.810 --> 44:10.105
No more alarms, no more bullshit,
no more games.

44:11.148 --> 44:15.027
One more mistake
you're determined to make.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.613
Remember, when it's time to pay,
I tried to stop you.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.371
Start with the night Bancroft got torched.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.802
I knew he liked to choke girls out.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.930
I knew he was coming back
from Osaka angry.

44:45.891 --> 44:47.601
That night, I needed him to go further.

44:49.687 --> 44:50.521
Why?

44:51.438 --> 44:54.191
So I could blackmail him
into stopping 653.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.822
You had him drugged with Stallion.
How did you do that?

45:01.657 --> 45:02.991
Transdermal.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.619
<i>Through a kiss.</i>

45:19.216 --> 45:20.467
Miriam.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.392
<i>She owed me.</i>

45:28.934 --> 45:31.395
She knew once he was dosed,
he'd kill the next thing he fucked.

45:31.478 --> 45:34.273
She also knew it wouldn't be her.

45:34.356 --> 45:35.732
And Mary Lou Henchy?

45:37.109 --> 45:38.235
She jumped.

45:38.318 --> 45:39.695
Yeah, but why?

45:39.778 --> 45:42.781
Because she didn't wanna die
at Bancroft's hand.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.204
<i>I'd invited him to Head in the Clouds.</i>

45:49.288 --> 45:51.790
<i>Made sure he was dosed, and it worked.</i>

45:51.874 --> 45:53.500
<i>He went further, all right. </i>

45:58.088 --> 46:01.592
<i>He real death'd the first girl, </i>
<i>smashed her stack.</i>

46:06.555 --> 46:09.558
<i>Even I didn't know </i>
<i>there was that much fury in him.</i>

46:12.478 --> 46:14.229
<i>So, Mary Lou ran.</i>

47:23.090 --> 47:25.050
Don't worry about him.

47:28.887 --> 47:30.722
Worry about me!

47:38.855 --> 47:42.526
<i>She did the one thing </i>
<i>she thought could checkmate us both.</i>

47:44.027 --> 47:48.657
<i>She thought her body would die, </i>
<i>but her stack would be found,</i>

47:48.740 --> 47:51.535
<i>that they'd spin her back up,</i>
<i>she'd tell the police what happened. </i>

47:52.077 --> 47:55.539
What she didn't know is I recoded her
the moment I hired her.

47:55.622 --> 47:56.790
Brings us to Ryker.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.418
He wouldn't back off.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.338
He was a piece that
needed to be taken off the board.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.424
So when Mary Lou washed up,
coded and dead,

48:05.507 --> 48:06.633
he guessed what happened.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.012
I was lucky he was so unstable.
He wasn't hard to frame.

48:10.971 --> 48:13.265
But 653 was moving forward and...

48:14.725 --> 48:18.562
I'd be ruined. Erased.

48:18.645 --> 48:21.398
So you used Bancroft for his influences
at the UN court.

48:21.481 --> 48:24.109
It took planning, being ready to leap
at the perfect moment,

48:24.192 --> 48:26.111
force him to do what I wanted. Once he'd slaughtered
two Neo-C-coded whores,

48:28.196 --> 48:29.573
he had as much to lose as I did.

48:31.992 --> 48:34.745
<i>He did what I told him, derailed 653. </i>

48:36.913 --> 48:38.874
But what happened next,
I couldn't predict.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.630
<i>He has an archaic streak.</i>

48:45.881 --> 48:47.591
<i>You'd call it honor.</i>

48:51.720 --> 48:53.722
<i>The fool wanted to forget.</i>

48:55.515 --> 48:58.310
As if that would make him clean
of what he'd done.

49:02.481 --> 49:04.941
<i>He slagged his own stack.</i>

49:10.280 --> 49:13.617
His arrogance wouldn't let him believe
he killed himself.

49:15.952 --> 49:19.998
He insisted he was murdered,
wouldn't let it go.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.459
Which brings us to you.

49:23.418 --> 49:27.964
You needed somebody
that Bancroft could trust. An Envoy.

49:28.548 --> 49:30.258
I didn't need someone.

49:31.551 --> 49:33.428
I needed you.

49:35.931 --> 49:39.184
You're right about the blood on my hands.
I drenched myself.

49:39.267 --> 49:41.603
To build a future for us.

49:42.562 --> 49:43.939
I waited.

49:44.022 --> 49:45.774
I waited for you, Tak.

49:45.857 --> 49:50.070
I waited for the perfect moment
to get you out so we could start again.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.491
I missed you so much.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.744
Never thought I'd be whole again.
