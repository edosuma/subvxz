AL MONTE: Hey, hey, hey!
You're digging the master
jock for solid rock.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.517
Sweet Al Monte
blasting, babies.

05:09.601 --> 05:14.313
Being bold and pouring coal
on station KRML in quaint
little Carmel-by-the-Sea.

05:14.398 --> 05:18.192
And we're right next door to
magnificent Monterey, home
of the annual jazz festival.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.487
And don't forget, even though
it's four months away, you
got to get your tickets, Jim,

05:21.571 --> 05:23.656
because they're going fast
and they can't last.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.826
All right, now. The time
is 7:54 and there's a breeze
of 50 degrees

05:26.910 --> 05:30.121
around your ever-loving hips,
and the weatherman says
we have a taste of fog.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.749
I say we got a bowl of soul,
and if you think your heart
can take it, whoo!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.669
Come fly higher
with The Heavy!

05:38.213 --> 05:40.214
Now we're gonna wrap it up
for the week, folks.

05:40.298 --> 05:44.635
A brand new release
from the funk capital
of the world, Squeeze Me.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.014
Uh-oh. Here he comes,
the big "D" himself,
Dave Garver.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.642
Dave, people, is gonna
bring you five hours
of mellow groove.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.519
So, in the meantime,
this is Sweet Al Monte saying

05:53.603 --> 05:57.273
hang in there, babies,
because everything is
going to be everything.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.482
Bye.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.859
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

05:59.943 --> 06:03.112
Hey, what's that
letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?

06:03.613 --> 06:04.864
Yeah.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.907
All right,
so what's happening?

06:06.992 --> 06:10.077
They want the usual thing.
A biography, pictures.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.122
Oh, really? Is that
that Madge Brenner chick?

06:14.332 --> 06:16.375
Yeah, she's the one
putting it together.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.627
Well, in that case,
David, you're in.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.173
How do you figure that?

06:22.257 --> 06:25.092
(LAUGHS) Now, David,
come on, man.
Are you kidding?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.303
Hey, she's a grandmother.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.680
Well, so when did
that ever stop you?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.226
(EXCLAIMING)

06:43.987 --> 06:46.113
Hey, man. You better
get a move on. I already
played your theme.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.741
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.951
And you're
on the air, baby.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.579
All right.

"Or as a girl,
naked to love
or be a man with"

This is Dave Garver
with a little verse,
a little talk

07:19.689 --> 07:23.734
and five hours of music
to be very, very nice
to each other by.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.536
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.870
WOMAN: Hello?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.288
Hi, what'll it be?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.040
Play Misty for me.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.291
Misty, huh?

07:40.252 --> 07:43.838
We have that
right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.884
I see you got your little
Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.679
Swing low.
You take it easy now, huh?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.181
See you in the a.m.

Hi, Murphy.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.013
Oh. Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.139
No?

08:35.222 --> 08:36.515
Heard your show tonight.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.683
Yeah?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.311
Well, it sure beats hell
out of working for a living.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.062
Thanks for the plug.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.438
What are friends for?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.899
Bartender.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.901
Coke? Coming right up.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.531
Uh-uh.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.284
She's waiting for someone.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.535
You sure?

08:56.620 --> 08:59.455
That's what she says.
Guys have been
striking out all night.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.462
One game?

09:07.631 --> 09:08.839
Cry Bastion?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.257
What else?

09:10.342 --> 09:13.928
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.142
Don't take all night. Move.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.310
Okay.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.027
Move.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.822
Palfrey's Gambit.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.158
Dirty rat.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.910
Are we playing
Copenhagen rules?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.246
Make it easy on
yourself, Murph.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.254
Cry Bastion.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.340
Sorry, no Bastion.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.342
Damn, I didn't see that.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.970
It's too bad,
Murphy. Too bad.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.272
Careful now.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.190
That ought to do it.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.611
Be really careful now.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.864
Careful.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.034
Hi.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.079
He doesn't see it.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.081
Oh, yeah?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.541
Cry Bastion.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.047
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.260
Care to play the winner?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.512
I'll just watch.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.681
My name is Dave Garver.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.890
Evelyn Draper.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.977
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.897
Care for a drink?
Okay.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.025
What'll it be?
Surprise me.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.276
Screwdriver.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.069
Nice game. Congratulations.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.237
Thank you.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.780
What happened?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.657
I won.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.159
How? When?

11:01.745 --> 11:03.370
When you said, "Okay."

11:05.874 --> 11:07.374
I ought to be mad.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.001
But you're not.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.295
Not really.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.806
Well, it certainly
was nice of you to bring
me home, Mr...

11:22.891 --> 11:24.224
Garver?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.726
That's right.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.773
I don't think I've been
stood up on a date since the
ninth grade back in Albany.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.651
Is something wrong?

11:34.736 --> 11:38.280
No. I keep getting the feeling
I know you from someplace.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.115
You do?

11:42.243 --> 11:44.203
Here. Why don't
you let me do that?

11:44.287 --> 11:46.538
Oh, no, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.415
Why don't you see
if you can get
the fire started?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.676
There are some matches
right next to it.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.095
All right.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.772
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not
keeping you up?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.650
No. I rarely get to bed
before 3:00 a.m.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.988
I didn't have
a date tonight.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.411
I went there because
you talk about it on
your program sometimes.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.287
And I wanted to meet you.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.838
I listen to you
all the time.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.549
I knew somebody
was out there.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.676
(LAUGHS) You're
making fun of me.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.970
No, I'm not.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.680
Say something else, huh?

12:45.014 --> 12:46.223
Such as?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.934
"Play Misty for me"?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.352
Very good.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.316
You sure I'm not
keeping you up?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.818
Don't you like me?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.114
You're a very nice girl.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.117
But who needs nice girls?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.370
No, I like them.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.914
I'm kind of hung up on one.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.583
And you don't want
to complicate your life.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.959
That's exactly right.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.794
Well, neither do I.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.923
But that's no reason
we shouldn't sleep together
tonight, if we feel like it.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.087
(DOOR CLOSING)

14:35.833 --> 14:39.545
Hi, ho, David, my man!
How you been, baby?

14:39.629 --> 14:42.673
See you got the joint
cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.

14:42.757 --> 14:43.882
Care for a beer?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.385
No, not really. I could go
for something more uplifting,

14:46.469 --> 14:48.887
but not a brew, David.
Not a brew, my man.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.890
Beer is all we've got.
Hey, Al, you're gonna
have to ease on out.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.600
I got a heck of a lot
of work to do today.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.061
Yeah, but you don't
understand, man. I've been
sent over here to get you.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.312
By whom?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.648
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.400
Carol?
Yeah, that's the one.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.985
Girl thinks you've been
working too hard, man.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.528
She said we
should get together
and go out tonight.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.113
Blast the town open
a little taste.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.739
Who's this "we"?

15:07.824 --> 15:10.826
Me, you, her and one of them
hens that you can dig up.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.080
Man, there is a fantastic
new Mexican place in
Carmel called Susinos.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.250
And the albondigas soup
is not to be believed.
It is a mind-bender...

15:18.334 --> 15:22.004
I know the joint,
but I don't have a date,
and I got a lot to do, really.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.089
Big deal, man. Get one!

15:24.841 --> 15:29.011
Look. If you have any problems
getting one, I'll get one
for you, as nice as I look.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.097
It's too late, and besides,
I've got a lot of work to do.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.682
Hey, man, but you
gotta eat, David.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.226
Yes, well, I'm gonna
whip up something right
here in my own kitchen.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.646
You know, David,
I'm really worried
about your social life.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.982
You know something,
you're gonna make somebody
a tremendous mother.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.067
Too narrow in the pelvis.

15:44.694 --> 15:49.114
I sure appreciate you
dropping by, Al. Come by
again sometime, anytime.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.075
Never let it be said
that Sweet Al Monte
can't take a hint.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.785
Who's hinting?
Hi.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.871
Why, hi there, yourself.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.498
Dave Garver live here?

15:58.583 --> 16:01.084
Well, that depends
on your point of view.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.794
Oh, hi.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.713
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.132
Right inside.
Just come on in
and help yourself.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.718
Swing right around
the bend there.
Thank you.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.264
I know, David, she's
from Chicken Delight.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.642
Look, don't work
too hard, my man.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.310
Don't strain yourself.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.192
How come you
don't have any beer?

16:25.276 --> 16:27.361
And what is this?
A shrunken head?

16:27.445 --> 16:28.987
Who was that guy?
Does he live here?

16:29.072 --> 16:30.739
Hey, look. I wanted...
I hope you like steak.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.158
I thought you look like
a steak-and-potatoes type.
Hang on.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.745
I said to myself,
a nice green salad with
Roquefort and tomatoes,

16:36.829 --> 16:38.455
and baked potato with...

16:38.539 --> 16:40.082
What's going on here?

16:40.750 --> 16:41.917
Don't send me away.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.418
No, I want to
ask you a question.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.420
I just wanted to surprise you.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.297
Surprise?

16:47.924 --> 16:50.634
What happens if he and I
had been talking business?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.719
Or maybe I have female
company or something,

16:52.804 --> 16:54.721
and you come traipsing in
with an armload of groceries?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.932
That would be some surprise.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.267
I'm sorry.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.104
Why don't you keep that stuff?
I think I've lost my appetite.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.855
Hang on a minute.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.773
I'm just trying to
tell you something,
that's all.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.026
I don't understand.
Should I go or should I stay?
What do you want?

17:08.111 --> 17:11.530
I'm trying to tell you
that there's a telephone, and
I pick it up and I dial it.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.700
You answer and I say,
"Hey, what are you doing?"

17:14.784 --> 17:16.660
And I say,
"I'll be right over."

17:16.743 --> 17:19.371
Fine. Next time,
why don't we do it that way?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.290
Okay. Any way you like.
Next time.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.169
How do you like your steak?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.964
Extremely rare.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.300
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.972
I'll get some wine.
Here. A little vino.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.974
Vino! All this
and heaven, too!

17:39.100 --> 17:41.977
Wow! Terrific!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.814
This is gonna be some dinner.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.192
Hey, what happened
to that discussion
we had last time?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.320
You know, the deal
about no strings and all that?

17:53.448 --> 17:55.991
There are no strings,
but I never said anything

17:56.075 --> 17:58.994
about not coming back
for seconds, did I?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.831
That's right. You didn't.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.924
When will I see you?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.843
I'll give you a call.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.179
(LAUGHS) Dave, you're funny.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.347
How's that?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.476
If you want to keep playing
these games, okay,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.770
but they're really
not necessary anymore,
not for me.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.689
Hey! People trying
to sleep here!

18:28.316 --> 18:30.609
People are trying
to talk here!

18:30.735 --> 18:32.360
How'd you like to
tell it to the law?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.404
How'd you like
to go screw yourself?

18:34.489 --> 18:36.406
(HONKING)

18:36.491 --> 18:39.868
Hey! Take it easy!
Guy's just trying
to sleep, that's all.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.539
You're right.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.375
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.171
Bye-bye.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.882
Hey, wait a minute!

20:17.717 --> 20:18.800
Yeah?

20:19.427 --> 20:20.427
Oh.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.805
Excuse me, I saw
the sweater, and I thought
you were somebody else.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.557
Oh, you must be David.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.158
Where have you been?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.914
Oh, around.

20:50.833 --> 20:54.419
I was trying to join
the revolt against
the representational.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.921
Didn't quite
make that, though.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.715
So now I'm just
trying to play it cool.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.801
Not quite making that, either.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.678
Got time for a break?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.515
Yeah.
Let's go.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.940
When did you get in town?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.274
Yesterday.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.776
You weren't
gonna call me?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.111
Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.406
Well, you shouldn't
lend your sweaters
to blabbermouths.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.784
You've gotten thinner.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.285
Oh, no!

21:28.371 --> 21:31.164
Well, so much for Sausalito.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.543
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.629
Jay Jay's place?

21:37.713 --> 21:38.755
Oh, it's nothing much, really.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.675
It's just a little
pied-Ã -terre, but it's
handy to the fleet.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.677
You told me you didn't
know where she was.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.679
So I lied. Picket me.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.722
Thanks a lot.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.891
Listen, stud,
it wasn't my idea.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.643
You should have
caught her act.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.813
The whole Bette Davis,
through-finished-kaput scene.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.106
And at 3:00 a.m.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.567
Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.489
Well, I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you
the afternoon off.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.243
What happened, pussycat?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.954
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.958
That bitch should be hung
by the thumbs or something
equally appropriate.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.002
DAVE: It's all set up.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.420
Let's go.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.463
Oh, well, it's nothing
personal, really.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.966
It's just that I happen
to think she could be
a first-rate artist

22:23.050 --> 22:25.760
if her damned hormones
didn't keep getting
in the way.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.595
There's not much
he can do about that.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.264
He could kill himself.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.892
Jay Jay, why don't you
go cruise some sailors, huh?

22:33.436 --> 22:36.438
Oh, please, don't
mention seafood.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.857
(LAUGHS)

22:38.941 --> 22:40.191
Come on.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.703
I really missed
this place.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.246
I missed you.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.542
You'd do me a big favor
if you didn't say things
like that.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.252
Why is that?

23:00.046 --> 23:02.964
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out
the worst in me.

23:03.132 --> 23:06.968
It makes me want
to say things like,
"How's that redhead?"

23:07.053 --> 23:08.136
What?

23:08.262 --> 23:11.389
The redhead,
the one who worked
in the bookstore.

23:11.474 --> 23:13.767
She went back to
Berkeley or whatever.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.393
Oh, that's too bad.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.856
You always have that
blonde from Santa Barbara
to fall back on.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.277
If that's the phrase
I'm looking for, and
I think it probably is.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.782
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?

23:28.866 --> 23:30.700
Who's got that kind of time?

23:31.702 --> 23:34.287
I just don't know if
I'm up to it anymore.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.747
Up to what?

23:36.791 --> 23:41.086
Those nights sitting and
waiting for you to finish
your program and come by.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.588
Nights when it would
start to get late

23:43.672 --> 23:46.424
and I'd start to think,

23:46.509 --> 23:51.096
"I wonder if he's run himself
off a cliff. Or maybe
he's run into a blonde."

23:52.139 --> 23:55.141
There was a time when
I started rooting for
the accident, you know.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.394
I mean, if it was a choice
between that and a blonde.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.855
You know how secure
you make me feel.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.066
Oh, I didn't wish you
anything too serious.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.277
Just a couple of
months in traction.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.029
You're all heart.

24:08.489 --> 24:12.992
You know, the thing I hate
the most in the whole world
is a jealous female,

24:13.077 --> 24:15.620
and that's what
I was getting to be.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.956
TOBIE: That's why
I had to split.

24:18.040 --> 24:23.294
I was starting to
be one of my most
unfavorite people.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.381
I hated it.
I know you did, too.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.055
That still works, anyway.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.182
Too well, sometimes.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.809
What does that mean?

24:37.893 --> 24:41.646
I mean, there's a little spot
in the middle of each day,
just about your size.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.985
Well, there's lots of
girls my size, if you're
really looking.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.071
I'm not. That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.660
You mean you've
given up girls?

24:55.744 --> 24:59.664
I haven't exactly been
the monk of the month
or anything like that,

24:59.748 --> 25:02.292
but I have been
making an effort.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.129
Boy, there must be
a real consternation
among those gropies.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.672
That's "groupies," isn't it?

25:07.756 --> 25:10.341
I don't know.
Groupies, gropies.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.346
You know, you've
got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.266
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.395
DAVE: You get a little bit
of the blame, too, you know.

25:22.479 --> 25:26.482
You and that parade of
roommates that keep moving
in and out of your place.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.068
I didn't realize they
were such a trial to you.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.196
What trial? I enjoyed it.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.908
You and I sitting
in front of the fireplace,

25:35.075 --> 25:39.787
and then some chick sitting
there with a bathrobe on,
eating Fig Newtons.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.497
(LAUGHS)

25:41.582 --> 25:43.541
DAVE: What about the one
with the St. Bernard?

25:43.626 --> 25:46.127
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.297
And then that other one,
the one that took
the flute lessons.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.175
Yeah, well maybe it was
a little rough on you.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.184
I can think of
a thousand reasons why
we should try again.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.695
(SIGHS) I've got about
seven million things to do.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.782
What do you think?
You want to try
for a new start,

26:15.866 --> 26:17.283
right from the letter "A"?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.582
What am I gonna do with you?

26:24.667 --> 26:25.833
A lot.

26:29.672 --> 26:32.423
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.549
Hi.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.178
You've met Anjelica, my...

26:37.304 --> 26:39.097
Roommate. Yes.

26:39.181 --> 26:43.518
I think I'll drive into
Carmel and see if I can't
find some cleaning solvent.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.770
There's plenty under the sink.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.897
Okay.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.483
This house ought to
have a revolving door.

26:50.693 --> 26:54.112
You know when my father
left me this house,
he left me payments.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.947
I can't handle that
expense by myself,

26:56.031 --> 26:58.283
and most girls
find the isolation
is too much for them.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.951
It's a long way from town.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.035
I know.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.997
I better get back to work.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.293
Thanks.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.169
That's it, "Thanks"?

27:14.216 --> 27:16.926
Four months in Sausalito
is a long time.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.556
I am not gonna
get back on that same
old merry-go-round again.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.684
What do I have to do,
give you a notarized
statement?

27:26.812 --> 27:30.273
I need a couple of
more days to try and

27:30.357 --> 27:32.317
figure out where I'm at.

27:33.569 --> 27:37.989
Okay. You get your bearings,
and then you'll give me
a call, all right?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.331
(SIGHING)

27:46.749 --> 27:48.708
(PHONE RINGING)

27:51.086 --> 27:52.170
Hi, Murph.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.421
Oh, hi, Dave.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.049
Sardine Factory.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.344
Dave Garver?

28:00.596 --> 28:02.764
You said this is Evelyn?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.265
No.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.601
Sorry, you've just missed him.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.063
What do you mean?

28:10.147 --> 28:12.190
He's gone.
He's not here.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.234
I think you'd
better look again.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.903
Believe me,
you just missed him.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.655
Now, if you're interested
in someone a little more
suave and sophisticated,

28:19.782 --> 28:21.949
(HANGS UP PHONE)
I'll be happy to...

28:22.201 --> 28:24.535
That's what I get for
being a dirty old man.

28:24.620 --> 28:28.373
There's a message for you,
a Madge somebody
from San Francisco.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.707
Brenner?
Yeah, that's it.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.667
Al Monte gave her
this number.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.920
"Received pictures
and biography.

28:34.004 --> 28:37.173
"Please send a two-hour
tape of your show
as soon as possible."

28:37.257 --> 28:38.424
Hey, thanks, Murph.

28:38.509 --> 28:39.550
Don't mention it.

28:39.635 --> 28:43.012
I can't tell you
how thrilled I am to be
your social secretary.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.266
You will put that on my tab?

29:07.663 --> 29:08.663
Surprise!

29:15.003 --> 29:16.129
What are you doing here?

29:16.213 --> 29:18.381
It was funny. I was
calling you from that
phone booth over there,

29:18.465 --> 29:20.758
and he was telling me
you'd left, and I was
staring right at your car.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.468
(GIGGLING)
Isn't that funny?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.513
Yeah, kind of funny.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.349
Why didn't you take my call?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.435
Where does it say that
I gotta drop what I'm doing

29:30.519 --> 29:32.770
and answer the phone
every time it rings?

29:33.272 --> 29:37.108
Do you know your nostrils
flare out into little wings
when you're mad?

29:37.484 --> 29:38.484
It's kind of cute.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.944
Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.028
I'd love a Coke.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.947
Not tonight. I gotta
get to the station.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.407
No, you don't.

29:44.491 --> 29:48.035
Hey, you're talking
to your number one fan.
You don't work tonight.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.745
(SIGHS)

29:49.830 --> 29:51.372
I've got this show
that I'm trying to set,

29:51.457 --> 29:53.291
and it happens to be
a very important show to me.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.169
That means I gotta pick
the music, I got to
write the lead-ins

29:56.253 --> 29:58.463
and I gotta find
some poetry.
Now come on, will you?

29:58.547 --> 29:59.755
Poetry?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.549
Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.050
I know all kinds by heart.
Not tonight!

30:12.269 --> 30:14.145
Does he want his keys?

30:14.229 --> 30:15.188
Come on, Evelyn.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.148
Speak. Come on!

30:17.232 --> 30:18.774
God!

30:18.859 --> 30:21.360
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.071
Come on.
Give me my keys.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.407
Come on. Give me the keys.
Come on.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.951
(LAUGHING)

30:29.036 --> 30:31.454
Give me the keys,
God damn it!

30:32.372 --> 30:34.207
MAN 1: Having some
trouble, lady?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.416
Get lost!

30:35.501 --> 30:37.502
Yeah, get lost, assholes!

30:38.253 --> 30:40.004
MAN 2: Yeah, let's split.
He's got enough
trouble already.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.756
MAN 1: Yeah. Excuse me.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.472
Bye. See you later.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.147
EVELYN: Hi. Get all
your work done?

31:47.406 --> 31:48.864
What do you want, Evelyn?

31:49.408 --> 31:50.449
One Coke?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.661
I'll tell you, tonight
I'm really whipped.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.165
(GIGGLES)

32:48.008 --> 32:49.258
What time is it?

32:49.718 --> 32:51.135
Time for me to go home.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.388
Go back to sleep.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.643
Hey, I've got an idea.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.186
What's that?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.605
Some night this week,
after the show,

33:02.689 --> 33:05.816
corned beef and potato salad,
dill pickles, the whole bit.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.860
My place. Deal?

33:07.944 --> 33:09.445
I'll call you.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.746
Thursday's good for me.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.176
(DOOR CLOSING)

33:46.942 --> 33:49.151
Oh, shit.

34:29.650 --> 34:34.112
And now from KRML,
the big-band sounds
of Dee Barton.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.114
Here's a fresh reel of
tape for your air check.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.742
You want me
to thread it up?

34:37.826 --> 34:39.994
No, leave it here. Thanks.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.913
All right. I think I will
go out and hit the streets,
but before doing that,

34:42.998 --> 34:46.125
I will blow me
a little number. Would you
care to partake, my man?

34:46.208 --> 34:48.168
Take it in the other room,
will you?

34:48.295 --> 34:51.045
I get zonked just
breathing the air around here.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.215
All right, be that way.

34:54.676 --> 34:55.885
Al?

34:55.969 --> 34:57.052
Yeah?

35:01.725 --> 35:04.101
Do you ever find yourself

35:04.186 --> 35:06.812
being completely
smothered by somebody?

35:06.897 --> 35:08.105
Anybody I know?

35:08.190 --> 35:10.274
Yeah, you met her
at my house the other day.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.568
Ooh! Chicken Delight!

35:12.652 --> 35:14.862
Well, that's what I call
a pretty good smothering,
cousin.

35:14.946 --> 35:19.366
You start a relationship
thinking you're gonna be
completely honest,

35:19.451 --> 35:22.578
and all of a sudden
the whole thing
gets out of hand.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.288
Yeah, well, what's
the problem?

35:24.372 --> 35:27.416
The problem is
I've been trying to
un-complicate my life,

35:27.501 --> 35:30.085
and now I can't even
answer the doorbell.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.630
Besides, Tobie's back.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.548
Oh, really? Tobie? When?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.008
I ran into her Sunday.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.385
That was a goody.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.929
Hey, I'll tell you
the truth, David.

35:40.013 --> 35:43.849
I've always thought that
Tobie was one of the foxiest
chicks on the peninsula.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.644
And why you gotta have
so much action, I just
don't understand it, anyway.

35:46.728 --> 35:47.978
You know what I mean?

35:48.063 --> 35:51.148
It's just a hang-up
I have, or had.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.651
But now that I seem
to have that all
straightened away,

35:53.735 --> 35:56.695
I can't seem to solve
this other problem.

35:57.197 --> 36:00.407
Well, you know what
they always say, my man.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.409
No. What?

36:05.705 --> 36:08.958
"He who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword."

36:10.418 --> 36:13.379
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.632
Later.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.264
DAVE: We'll have more smooth
sounds in just one minute.

36:23.765 --> 36:27.601
But first, at 10 minutes
to the hour, we're
broadcasting from KRML

36:27.686 --> 36:29.562
in the Carmel Rancho
Shopping Center,

36:29.646 --> 36:32.773
home of the Buccaneer,
the man's boutique.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.531
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.867
The whole point in having
an answering service

36:42.951 --> 36:46.412
is to call them
once in a while and see
if you've got any messages.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.372
Hi, Evelyn. What's happening?

36:48.540 --> 36:51.417
What could be
happening, darling?
You're not here yet.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.751
"Yet"?

36:52.836 --> 36:55.838
I hope you like
pastrami, because they
didn't have any corned beef.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.340
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.

36:59.134 --> 37:02.177
Are you trying to tell me
you forgot that we have
a date tonight?

37:02.262 --> 37:05.055
I thought I was supposed
to call you on that.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.974
It's just that I feel
kind of silly sitting here

37:07.058 --> 37:08.976
in my brand-new
lounging pajamas.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.937
I just assumed...

37:13.315 --> 37:15.149
Apparently, I assumed wrong.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.651
That's right.
You assumed wrong.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.908
You don't have to come over,
Dave, if you've got something
better to do.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.243
No, that's all right, I'll
be over in a little while.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.704
You and I are gonna
have to have a talk.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.290
Whatever you say.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.376
In the meantime, haven't
you forgotten something else?

37:34.461 --> 37:35.836
What's that?

37:36.379 --> 37:38.547
Weren't you gonna
play Misty for me?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.593
Yeah. I have
that one right here.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.428
Thank you, darling.

38:03.365 --> 38:07.576
And now we have
a pretty one for lonely
lovers on a cool, cool night.

38:08.078 --> 38:11.038
It's the great Erroll Garner
classic, Misty.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.375
And this one is
especially for Evelyn.

Come in.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.656
Hi.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.537
Cold night, huh?
Yeah.

38:51.621 --> 38:54.248
But you got here
anyway. Stout fella.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.875
Look, Evelyn, there's
something we're gonna
have to get straight.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.254
It's amazing what a man
will go through for
a hot pastrami sandwich.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.422
Now look...

39:01.506 --> 39:03.841
Wait a minute. You haven't
told me how nice I look.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.467
You look fine.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.511

guaranteed you'd flip.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.846
Now, listen. Can we talk?

39:08.930 --> 39:10.180
Wait.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.515
First...

39:23.570 --> 39:24.862
Surprise.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.740
Don't you like them?

39:27.949 --> 39:29.366
Yeah, they're great, but...

39:29.451 --> 39:32.494
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.

Stop it, Evelyn!

39:41.713 --> 39:43.589
Now, we've gotta talk!

39:44.591 --> 39:46.050
Have I done something wrong?

39:46.134 --> 39:49.136
I'm just trying to be
straight with you, that's all.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.431
Be nice to me instead.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.974
Jesus Christ!

39:57.020 --> 39:58.771
I don't understand.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.192
Are you trying to say
you don't love me anymore?

40:04.319 --> 40:06.945
I never told you
that I loved you.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.448
Not in words, maybe,

40:09.532 --> 40:12.910
but, Dave, there are lots
of ways of saying things that
have nothing to do with words.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.287
I'm sorry you
read it that way.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.000
It's that other
bitch, isn't it?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.503
What are you talking about?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.505
The picture in the
silver frame in your dresser.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.924
Look, that picture has got
nothing to do with you.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.134
What does have to do with me?

40:29.219 --> 40:30.385
I never lied to you.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.262
Big deal.
He never lied to me.

in my little whore suit,

and master to call?

40:43.149 --> 40:44.900
Nobody asked you
to wait for anything.

You're not dumping me,
buster blue eyes.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.529
Get off my back, Evelyn!

40:48.613 --> 40:52.157
Get off your back?
That's where you've been
keeping me, isn't it?

You're not even good in bed!

I've been saying to you.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.097
Yes, I have. I've heard
everything you said.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.516
You did, huh?
All right, tell me.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.353
You don't
believe me, huh?

drive you home, that's what.

as bad as it looked.

You know, Dave,
I'm supposed to turn
a report in on this.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.180
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.

48:12.932 --> 48:14.307
I'd rather be the one
to tell her,

48:14.392 --> 48:16.309
and not have her read it
in the paper somewhere.

48:16.394 --> 48:20.564

I'll tell Marie. We'll
do the spaghetti number.

be around here today?

pretty good.

before you take her home.

And how long will that be?

48:32.243 --> 48:34.327
It's hard to say. Why?

Tobie out tonight.

this afternoon, 5:00 or so.

Is she gonna be all right?

48:46.757 --> 48:49.175

pretty superficial.

she'll try it again?

Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.

48:57.768 --> 49:02.188
I wouldn't leave her alone
if she seems unusually
depressed or insecure.

wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?

and ready to go.
What time is the party?

Well, Madalyn's already
left, and she won't be
back for a long time,

51:01.642 --> 51:02.976
Would you be
terribly disappointed

51:03.060 --> 51:06.229
if we didn't go to
the party and just
stayed here instead?

Well, I think I can
bear up under it.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:09.173
I don't know.
What about her family?

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:11.258
I don't know that either.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:17.056
She just listens
to my radio show, and
we met one night. That's all.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.974
Practically a stranger.

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:20.184
That's right.

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:23.062
Then how does she
happen to have a key
to your front door?

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:25.981
I don't know that either.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:29.652
It boils down to,
you don't know
a hell of a lot, do you?

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:32.905
What it boils down to is
I'm getting sick of
your questions.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.657
And so am I!

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.493
But they get upset
with me down at the store
if I don't ask them.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.871
Just take her through.
I'll be right along.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.122
Right.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.791
Take her through what?

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.084
Booking.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.881
What she really needs
is psychiatric help.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.133
Really?

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:59.098
Now, look, those cuts
on her wrists...

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.935
Don't know
anything about those.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.566
There's one other thing.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.444
I know. "Don't leave town."

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:16.198
I was gonna say,
"Why don't you play
some Mantovani sometime?"

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.619
Didn't know you
liked the show, Sergeant.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.788
I don't. I like Mantovani.

She just paid me a visit
with a butcher knife.

Well, I sure like the way
you broke your ass to
let me know about it.

about it myself.

down there, anyway?

want to help find her

did she say to you?

she was well and that
she was going to Hawaii.

did she say?

It was a line from a poem.

the line. Wouldn't I?

you play Mantovani.

listen to the show.

down at the station,

before I turned your show on.

to grab her the next time
she tries it.

she be back?

in a state sanitarium.

they let her out.

to worry about it.

gonna try to remember.

isolated down there.

to do is just call Al Monte
and have him sub for me.

we've got is when she
phones in here tonight.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:38.396
Annabel.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:53.828
Good, huh?

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:55.162
Mmm. Too much.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.004
So is this.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:04.922
Thank you.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:07.633
Just one thing.
Do you mind?

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:09.301
No, be my guest.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.304
The eyes are wrong.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:17.852
David's are more...

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:20.563
How shall I say?

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.064
Colder.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.026
I didn't know you knew David.

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:27.611
Hmm?
I didn't realize
you and David were...

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.700
Were friends.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.035
Friends?

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:40.875
(LAUGHS) Oh.
No, not friends.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:46.338
Not friends.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:03.314
God, you're dumb.

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:44.063
EVELYN: "Because this
maiden she lived with
no other thought

01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:46.690
"Than to love and
be loved by you"

01:30:57.869 --> 01:30:59.203
(DIALING)

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:07.711
Tobie?

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:10.214
EVELYN: We're waiting
for you, David.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:39.243
(ON TAPE) This is Dave Garver
with a little verse,

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:41.912
a little talk and
five hours of music

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:44.915
to be very, very nice
to each other by.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.459
(GRUNTING)

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:36.425
Careful.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:39.637
I might put your eye out.

01:32:46.019 --> 01:32:48.312
I'll bet David
loves your eyes.

01:33:02.702 --> 01:33:04.203
And your hair.

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:14.672
Does he run his fingers
through your hair?

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:27.685
Have to get you
all nice for David.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.189
For David.

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:45.911
I hope he likes what he sees
when he walks in here,

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:50.165
because that's what he's
taking to hell with him.

01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:38.797
(GATE CREAKING)

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:54.938
Miss Williams?

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:30.099
(SCREAMING)

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:32.643
(GASPING)

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.038
McCallum?

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.184
(GLASS CRUNCHING)

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:32.155
(MOANING)

01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:34.908
(MUFFLED SPEECH)

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:47.337
(SCREAMING)

01:38:48.006 --> 01:39:32.424
(GRUNTING)

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.227
(SCREAMING)

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:52.796
DAVE ON RADIO: And now here's
a pretty one for lonely
lovers on a cool, cool night.

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:55.841
It's the great Erroll Garner
classic, Misty.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.969
And this one is
especially for Evelyn.
