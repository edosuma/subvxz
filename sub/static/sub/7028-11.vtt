I've never believed
in anything more in my life.

08:35.734 --> 08:37.232
All right.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.303
Are we protecting her
or enabling her?

08:40.339 --> 08:41.270
A little of both.

08:41.306 --> 08:42.606
Okay, you guys.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.208
We are, like,
99% sure Javi was kidnapped.

08:45.244 --> 08:46.176
[all gasp]

08:46.211 --> 08:47.577
Mm-hmm.

08:47.613 --> 08:51.281
Now, he was last seen wearing...
actually, I'm not sure,

08:51.316 --> 08:53.083
so I'm just gonna take
a wild guess and say jeans

08:53.118 --> 08:55.118
that are way too tight
and a lot of hair product.

08:55.154 --> 08:56.253
Oh, and the sparkly blouse.

08:56.288 --> 08:58.321
- Mm, that was yesterday.
- Oh, yeah.

08:58.357 --> 09:00.724
We need to get this
on milk cartons ASAP.

09:01.794 --> 09:02.959
Okay?

09:02.995 --> 09:05.729
I know, it's the most
respectable photo I found.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.464
We've got to figure out
who my stalker is

09:07.499 --> 09:10.133
by CSI'ing
all the clues we have.

09:10.169 --> 09:14.438
Here's everything
my stalker sent me.

09:17.576 --> 09:20.243
Well, I haven't figured out
the identity of your stalker,

09:20.279 --> 09:22.679
but they made a collage
of your Target receipts.

09:22.714 --> 09:24.347
How many throw pillows
do you need?

09:24.383 --> 09:25.549
You only have one couch.

09:25.584 --> 09:27.951
Hey, Roxie,
this looks really elaborate.

09:27.986 --> 09:28.952
What have you found out?

09:28.987 --> 09:31.321
Found out?
Not much.

09:31.356 --> 09:33.590
But how cool is this?

09:33.625 --> 09:35.091
I made a flower.

09:35.127 --> 09:36.660
Ana, this is a lot of stuff.

09:36.695 --> 09:38.428
Can you think of anyone who
would hold a grudge against you?

09:38.464 --> 09:40.096
No, people love me.

09:40.132 --> 09:41.865
Uh, my evil twin sister,

09:41.900 --> 09:43.533
when you proved that she was
out to get me.

09:43.569 --> 09:45.135
Kate from "Scientifico Sexy"

09:45.170 --> 09:46.536

<i>at her own game.</i>

09:46.572 --> 09:47.838
My ex-husband
when you made sure

09:47.873 --> 09:49.153
that we didn't get back
together.

09:49.174 --> 09:52.909
Your ex-boyfriend/boss
whose heart you broke.

09:52.945 --> 09:55.679
Plus, that guy that you cut
off on your way in this morning,

09:55.714 --> 09:57.581
he said you were bitchy.

09:57.616 --> 10:00.116
Wait, that was me.
Sorry.

10:00.152 --> 10:03.220
Okay, okay, so I may have
stepped on a few toes,

10:03.255 --> 10:04.621
but we've been at this
for hours,

10:04.656 --> 10:06.756
and all we have to show for it
is that I should wear a bra

10:06.792 --> 10:08.792
when I take out the trash.

10:08.827 --> 10:11.528
Guys,
I guess I have to admit it.

10:11.563 --> 10:13.096
Javi's not kidnapped.

10:13.131 --> 10:16.700
He just probably decided
he didn't want to be with me.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.802
I just wasn't ready to face it.

10:18.837 --> 10:21.137
- Ana.
- No, no, it's okay.

10:21.173 --> 10:23.006
I'm just gonna go home
and hang out with that bird

10:23.041 --> 10:24.374
that won't leave my condo.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.946
Hey, hey, hey, Isaac.

10:29.982 --> 10:32.082
Since you've been working
on a new show idea,

10:32.117 --> 10:34.184
it would be very irresponsible
of me

10:34.219 --> 10:35.619
not to show you
my special skills.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.124
Mime. Really?

10:45.330 --> 10:49.366
Okay, that's not bad.

10:49.401 --> 10:50.367
Wait.
[coughs]

10:50.402 --> 10:51.868
I got more stuff.

10:51.904 --> 10:53.570
I feel so bad for Ana.

10:53.605 --> 10:56.606
She's probably facedown
in a chicken potpie by now.

10:56.642 --> 10:58.942
Okay, where do you think Javi
really is?

10:58.977 --> 11:01.745
Oh, okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

11:01.780 --> 11:03.900
I think he might have gotten
back together with Kelly.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.148
Are we saying that
out loud now?

11:05.183 --> 11:06.623
'Cause I've been thinking it
all day.

11:06.652 --> 11:08.218
I wish for Ana's sake
it wasn't true,

11:08.253 --> 11:09.386
but, I mean, come on.

11:09.421 --> 11:10.720
Kelly is amazing.

11:10.756 --> 11:13.490
Right? Saving all those orphans
from that burning building.

11:13.525 --> 11:16.793
And she's in incredible shape from
her award-winning samba dancing.

11:16.828 --> 11:19.796
And she worked in a hospital
saving lives.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.765
Hospital?

11:21.800 --> 11:23.934
Samba dancing?

11:23.969 --> 11:25.135
Orphans.

11:25.170 --> 11:26.403
Do you know what this means?

11:26.438 --> 11:29.105
Kelly's way too busy.
She needs to unplug.

11:29.141 --> 11:31.441
No, Kelly has been copying

11:31.476 --> 11:34.177
everything that Ana's
been doing in her shows.

11:34.212 --> 11:36.046
But was Ana ever
a cross-dressing

11:36.081 --> 11:38.782
cruise ship director?

11:38.817 --> 11:39.849
[both gasp]

11:39.885 --> 11:41.585
Does this mean
the stalker is...

11:41.620 --> 11:43.920
Kelly,
what are you doing here?

11:43.956 --> 11:45.755
I heard you were looking
for Javi.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.592
Well, I found him.

11:48.627 --> 11:49.826
[grunting]

11:49.861 --> 11:52.195
Yes, bound and gagged.
I knew it.

11:54.232 --> 11:55.712
I'm sorry.
Did you find him like that?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.167
Or did you do that to him?

11:57.202 --> 12:00.437
Oh, no, my bad.
Yeah, I totally did that to him.

12:00.472 --> 12:01.538
Oh.

12:01.673 --> 12:02.906
Oh.

12:04.404 --> 12:06.805
So wait.
You're my stalker?

12:06.840 --> 12:10.675
We prefer
unrequited best friend.

12:11.271 --> 12:13.638
Why is this happening?
I don't even know you.

12:13.673 --> 12:15.406
Yes, but I know you.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.642
See, my parents worked
all the time.

12:17.677 --> 12:20.178
Literally.
They owned a 24 Hour Fitness.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.080
So I was raised by babysitters,

12:22.115 --> 12:24.382
and they all watched
your telenovelas.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.051
In a way, the one constant
in my life was you.

12:27.087 --> 12:28.386
Aww.

12:28.421 --> 12:29.754
Kelly, just let Ana go.

12:29.789 --> 12:30.855
She doesn't have anything
to do with this.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.591
Ana has everything
to do with this.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.693
You're just a pawn, pretty boy.

12:35.729 --> 12:37.028
Ooh, hoo-hoo.

12:37.063 --> 12:38.963
I don't understand.
What do you want?

12:38.999 --> 12:42.867
To be you, of course, which
is why I copied your shows.

12:42.902 --> 12:44.302
I followed you everywhere.

12:44.337 --> 12:45.603
I went through your trash.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.939
P.S.,
you should really recycle more,

12:47.974 --> 12:49.474
if not for us,
then for the children.

12:49.509 --> 12:51.509
- They are our future.
- Why are you agreeing with her?

12:51.544 --> 12:53.845
Because she has us tied up.
Plus, she has a point.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.481
I did whatever I could
just to be you,

12:56.516 --> 12:57.949
including date Javi,

12:57.984 --> 13:00.251
but it was pretty clear that
he still had feelings for you,

13:00.286 --> 13:02.787
that I would never be enough
for him.

13:02.822 --> 13:05.523
And then I realized
that no matter what I did,

13:05.558 --> 13:07.959
I could actually never
really be you.

13:07.994 --> 13:10.995
So I might have gone
a little bit crazy.

13:11.031 --> 13:13.531
But now I have a new plan.

13:13.566 --> 13:15.733
To let us go? Great.
No harm, no foul.

13:15.769 --> 13:19.270
- We keep this between us.
- No, if I can't be Ana,

13:19.305 --> 13:22.140
I'm gonna be Ana's best friend.
Do you want to be best friends?

13:22.175 --> 13:23.107
Yes.

13:23.143 --> 13:24.308
Yes!

our last conversation,

14:31.478 --> 14:32.944
and that's what you want
to talk about?

14:32.979 --> 14:34.145
Besides, those jeans have
too many pockets.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.291
Oh, I love it.
That's incredible.

17:00.326 --> 17:01.626
- Where did you buy it?
- Okay.

17:01.661 --> 17:04.694
Ahh!

17:04.731 --> 17:06.097
Wait. Wait.

17:06.132 --> 17:07.811
Are you really gonna kill
your best friend?

17:07.834 --> 17:10.233
Well, we've only been best
friends for, like, 20 minutes.

17:10.270 --> 17:11.301
I'll get over it.

17:11.337 --> 17:12.569
Argh!
Ahh!

17:18.678 --> 17:20.144
Let's go save Ana.

17:20.179 --> 17:21.612
- Whoo!
- Oh!

17:23.616 --> 17:25.583
Or that could happen.

17:43.980 --> 17:48.315
Hey, that was pretty scary
stuff back there, huh?

17:48.317 --> 17:50.818
I didn't know how crazy
Kelly is.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.453
You know what was crazy?

17:52.455 --> 17:54.256
You were gonna let her kill you
to protect me.

17:55.624 --> 17:57.257
Look, Javi,
I really need to know

17:57.259 --> 17:59.293
so I can move on either way.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.894
Were you gonna show up
to coffee?

18:00.896 --> 18:02.796
Yes, I was.

18:02.798 --> 18:04.798
The only thing that could have
kept me away from you

18:04.800 --> 18:06.433
was a knife-wielding maniac.

18:06.435 --> 18:08.135
Although I was running late,

18:08.137 --> 18:10.437
because I was parallel parking,
and someone was watching,

18:10.439 --> 18:12.973
but I was gonna be there.

18:14.377 --> 18:17.478
I can't stop thinking about you,
Ana, about us.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.447
Me too.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.549
How do you have your guitar?

18:22.551 --> 18:25.052
I always have it.
I actually wrote you a song.

18:25.054 --> 18:26.820
I was gonna sing it for you
at the coffee shop.

18:26.822 --> 18:28.422
I mean, I know how much
you hate my guitar,

18:28.424 --> 18:30.024
so I don't have to;
I really don't have to.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.658
Sing the damn song, Javi.

I'm back from the dead.

You died?

19:52.208 --> 19:53.907
I fell off a mountain.

I was buried in snow for days.
It took me weeks to recover.

Weren't you wondering why
you didn't hear from me?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.515
The first thing I did
when I got back to Miami

20:01.517 --> 20:04.051
was get me a snow cone.

20:07.256 --> 20:09.089
Ana, the only thing
that kept me alive out there

20:09.091 --> 20:11.024
was the thought
of getting back to you.
