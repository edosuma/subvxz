WEBVTT

00:52.040 --> 00:56.557
So by examining the boy's head you will know
whether he is of a criminal disposition?

00:56.720 --> 01:00.839
There is a depression here
in the area of causality,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.516
indicating the subject is unaware
of the consequences of his actions.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.752
How did you get into the Palace, boy?

01:06.920 --> 01:10.231
If I tell you that, I won't ever
be able to go back now, will I?

01:11.720 --> 01:17.239
An apothecary's errand boy.
How could he just walk in off the street?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.869
Maybe he... climbed.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.793
Over a wall like a cat.

01:21.960 --> 01:25.431
Like a curious, curious cat
who wanted to see his Queen.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.239
- It sounds like a nursery rhyme.
- This is serious.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.153
What if he had had a knife?

01:31.320 --> 01:33.915
What if he had stabbed us in our sleep?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.673
What...

01:35.840 --> 01:37.672
What if he had hurt Vicky?

01:37.840 --> 01:39.797
He was just a little boy, Albert.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.600
Even I could have overpowered him
in my condition.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.480
The way that this palace
is run, it's chaos.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.916
Cobwebs in every corner.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.198
The drains are like an Augean stable.
And it's porous.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.512
If it bothers you so much,
stop complaining and do something about it.

01:54.680 --> 01:58.151
You are giving me permission
to reform the way the Palace is run.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.518
Well, if it will stop you
ruining my breakfast, then yes.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.630
Let your papa show you how efficient he is.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.952
Well, thank you for coming
all the way down from London, Doctor.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.918
I'm afraid the local man's...
run out of remedies.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.552
The weakness on the left side
suggests a grave disorder.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.270
I must advise complete rest
and an absence of stimulants.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.990
The cure sounds worse than the complaint.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.119
I'm not talking about a cure, my Lord.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.477
With a case like this,
the prognosis isn't certain.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.999
In some cases, there is a steady decline, while
for others things progress more quickly.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.919
May I suggest, my Lord,
that you put your affairs in order?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.879
<i>It's most curious.</i>

02:50.440 --> 02:53.877
I have written to Lord M several times
and received no reply.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.275
He has not answered my
letters either, Ma'am.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.670
Could you go and see him,
find out what's the matter?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.036
Yes, of course, Ma'am.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.830
Mr Penge, it is your duty to oversee
the Palace staff, is it not?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.798
- Yes, sir.
- Well, can you explain to me why

03:10.960 --> 03:15.193
in all the time that I've been here in the
Palace, the windows have not been cleaned once?

03:15.360 --> 03:17.352
Look at them. They are filthy.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.395
Only on the outside, sir,

03:19.560 --> 03:22.871
which falls under the jurisdiction
of the Commissioner for Woods and Forests

03:23.040 --> 03:26.397
who perhaps, on this occasion,
has been remiss in his duties.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.554
The inside, which is my domain,
if you'll permit me...

03:32.400 --> 03:33.754
.. is spotless.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.077
Thank you.

03:39.720 --> 03:45.193
There are more begging letters than usual,
Ma'am, some even requesting an audience.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.192
But in your condition...

03:47.360 --> 03:50.512
His nose is quite dry.
Don't you think, Skerrett?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.830
Oh. Yes, Ma'am.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.279
I shall write to Mr Bascombe and all the
others and tell them that you're indisposed.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.635
Bascombe?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.950
I know that name.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.998
He wove the silk for your
wedding dress, Ma'am.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.719
Yes, of course. I remember now.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.637
He managed to put our monogram
into the material. Exquisite.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.031
Well, I shall certainly see Mr Bascombe.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.192
And, Skerrett, will you see that Dash is given
a dish of those chicken livers he likes?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.352
Yes, Ma'am.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.511
A bushel of sugarplums a month.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.514
Would you say this palace
is efficiently run, Brodie?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.672
Why, no, sir.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.433
But that is to be expected.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.389
When you come into royal service, sir,
you know the wages won't be much.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.951
But it's a great honour
to be working at the Palace.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.635
- And the perks are plentiful.
- Perks?

04:53.200 --> 04:56.557
The housemaids get the household
tea leaves, for example.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.360
What on earth
can they do with used tea leaves?

04:59.520 --> 05:01.398
They sell them, sir.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.711
There's still a brew to be had in them.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.831
<i>I have brought you a letter from the Queen.</i>

05:18.000 --> 05:21.914
You should have told me you were coming. I'd
have arranged all manner of entertainments.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.517
If I'd told you I was coming,
you would have found a way to put me off.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.672
Yeah, well, that's probably true.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.556
I have become something
of a hermit of late.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.592
The Queen would like to know why
you haven't answered her letters.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.629
I've found myself with nothing to say.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.909
I think she would find
that hard to believe.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.312
Well, what to tell her?

05:55.360 --> 05:59.115
Tell her there's nothing wrong with me
apart from congenital laziness.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.634
How's that?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.193
He doesn't want to play today.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.513
- He's getting older, Ma'am.
- Dash isn't old. Are you?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.870
- Sit there.
- Mr Bascombe, Your Majesty.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.269
Oh, yes.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.113
Mr Bascombe.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.992
How can I help you?

06:24.240 --> 06:26.232
Your Majesty.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.235
I come on behalf of
the silk weavers of Spitalfields.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.995
We come to implore you
to preserve our livelihood

06:33.160 --> 06:36.073
from the import of silk from the Continent.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.278
- Well, I'm not sure that I...
- Look at this silk.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.072
You can see how lustrous it is.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.999
How the warp and weft
are separate but harmonious.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.116
Now, look at this foreign material.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.751
You see how dull it is in comparison?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.238
How crude the colours are?

07:02.840 --> 07:05.594
Yes. Yes, I can see the difference.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.353
I have a son. Nathaniel.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.397
I always thought he'd succeed me...
my loom at Fournier Street.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.679
But if we allow this inferior material
to put us out of business, then...

07:19.320 --> 07:21.312
he'll have no profession.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.759
He'll just be another hungry boy
on the streets of London looking for work.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.317
But the Government cannot
introduce a tariff

07:31.480 --> 07:35.076
to protect every industry
threatened by cheaper imports, Ma'am.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.596
But isn't that exactly
what the Corn Laws do, Sir Robert?

07:37.760 --> 07:41.390
Protect English farmers
from the imports of cheaper corn.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.155
I fear you may be
oversimplifying things, Victoria.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.118
The two cases are very different, Ma'am.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.320
Yes. The silk weavers of Spitalfields
do not have seats in the House of Lords.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.473
I wonder, Ma'am, if I
might make a suggestion.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.834
As the leader of fashionable society,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.914
if you were to make it known that you
will only wear Spitalfields silk...

08:02.080 --> 08:06.120
Indeed, Ma'am.
If you were to preside at an occasion

08:06.280 --> 08:09.193
at which all the guests
were required to wear it,

08:09.360 --> 08:14.151
well, that I believe would bring the matter to
the public's attention as nothing else could.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.836
An excellent notion. What about a ball?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.399
Of course, it would have to be soon.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.429
I wonder, Ma'am,
given the considerable discontent

08:26.600 --> 08:29.069
among the lower orders at the moment,

08:29.240 --> 08:32.677
whether a ball might be... misconstrued.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.914
Misconstrued, Prime Minister?

08:35.080 --> 08:38.198
I'm thinking of Marie Antoinette,
the late Queen of France, Ma'am,

08:38.360 --> 08:42.991
who, when the Paris mob demanded bread,
replied, "Let them eat cake."

08:44.640 --> 08:47.758
If I were a member of the lower orders...

08:48.560 --> 08:50.517
I might blame the Prime Minister,

08:50.680 --> 08:54.674
who supports the Corn Laws that make bread
unaffordable, for my misfortunes.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.994
These are difficult times, sir.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.914
Another bad harvest,
strikes in the North...

09:06.080 --> 09:08.072
the country is in a state of unrest.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.475
The Chartists claim to have
three million signatures to their petition.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.111
This ball of Her Majesty's
could not have come at a worse time.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.834
I understand your concern.
Let me speak with the Queen.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.392
The ball must be fancy dress,

09:30.560 --> 09:33.758
so that everyone will have a new costume
made of Spitalfields silk.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.640
And it will be a chance
to see so many old friends.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.556
- Harriet must come.
- Yes, Ma'am.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.712
And I have written to Lord M.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.199
I want to fill my dance card.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.360
Surely you're not intending
to dance, Ma'am?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.399
And why on earth not?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.871
Oh, Duchess, you cannot keep
all the partners to yourself.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.157
If I dance the first two sets with you,

09:58.320 --> 10:01.597
I think I should be allowed
at least one waltz with Victoria.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.710
A woman in your condition
should not be gallivanting, Ma'am.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.236
I believe you have a cold, Duchess.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.232
You have my permission to withdraw.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.159
I was wondering
if we could have a medieval theme.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.916
This is Edward Ill.
He founded the Order of the Garter.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.232
Well, he reminds me of you.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.552
Is it right, Victoria,

10:40.720 --> 10:44.316
for us to hold a ball when so many
of your people are starving?

10:44.480 --> 10:47.040
But this is a way of trying
to help them, Albert.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.874
I think you have the legs of a Plantagenet.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.990
And I think you would look magnificent
in a crown. Don't you think, Ernest?

10:55.160 --> 10:57.277
Well, to the manner born, I would say.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.710
Here are Edward Ill and his wife,
Queen Philippa of Hainault.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.749
Edward once laid siege
to the town of Calais.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.833
But rather than destroy the whole town,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.597
he asked that six of its most prominent
citizens surrender themselves to him.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.516
He was going to execute
these poor... grey-bearded old men

11:56.680 --> 12:00.674
until his wife, the kindly Queen Philippa,

12:00.840 --> 12:06.837
pleaded with him on the life of their
unborn child to spare their lives.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.992
Such a charming story.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.712
And so fitting.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.040
Might I show you the stained glass, Ma'am?

12:22.800 --> 12:26.760
You are intending
to attend the ball, then, sir?

12:27.440 --> 12:31.753
The Queen is of the belief that this...
spectacle, as you call it...

12:32.960 --> 12:36.237
.. will remind the rich of
their obligation to the poor.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.678
I understand the Queen means well.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.993
But I beg you, sir, ask her to reconsider.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.517
The Queen has made up her mind,
I'm afraid, Sir Robert.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.720
And there is nothing
that I would say that could change it.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.079
Allow me to show you
the carving in the east transept.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.640
Have you chosen your costume yet, sir?

13:12.800 --> 13:14.234
Are you going to be a knight?

13:14.400 --> 13:17.279
Oh, I think there will be
enough armour at the ball.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.675
I would like to go as someone
completely different.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.719
A cat among the heraldic pigeons.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.312
Someone like Robin Hood?

13:27.360 --> 13:31.400
He was an outlaw who lived in Sherwood
Forest with his band of archers

13:31.560 --> 13:34.917
fighting for King Richard
against the wicked usurper King John.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.072
A lawless archer...

13:38.040 --> 13:40.350
Yes, I think that would suit me very well.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.279
One man, one vote. Sign
this petition here...

13:48.440 --> 13:50.397
If you can't sign your name,
just make your mark.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.995
One man, one vote. Come
on, sir, don't be shy.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.992
Sign the petition here.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.551
There.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.433
Shall we put it on her?

14:01.600 --> 14:05.435
- Silk?
- The Queen is expecting again.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.000
I've been doing the alterations.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.834
- That was quick.
- Don't think she's too happy about it.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.993
Doesn't make a difference
if you're the Queen or a laundry maid.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.152
You get caught just the same.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.590
You should count yourself lucky, Nancy.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.912
I should go.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.317
Her Majesty has a fitting
for her ball costume.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.472
Thought you said she was expecting.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.192
The Queen thinks it will help
the silk weavers to have another ball.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.795
Sounds like an excuse for a party to me.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.076
I think she means well.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.597
I'm sure she does but she don't know
what it means to be hungry.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.558
Someone eats a pie in the street out there,

14:41.720 --> 14:44.554
the kids follow behind
like birds looking for crumbs.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.157
They don't need balls. They need bread.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.358
The whole of London is in a state
of excitement about the ball.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.516
I shall be going as
the Abbess of Woldingham.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.312
A woman who wields power with discretion.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.193
And you?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.758
Have you chosen a costume?

15:11.920 --> 15:14.640
I thought I might go as Dante.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.157
On his way to Paradise,
not the other place.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.312
So you are going to come?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.032
Why shouldn't I?

15:37.560 --> 15:39.552
From Garrard's, Ma'am.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.472
Thank you.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.554
This is for you.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.120
- Me?
- Yes, you.

15:56.280 --> 16:00.991
Oh, well, we have not yet finished the
memorandum into the Treaty of Nanking, so...

16:01.160 --> 16:05.234
We can open the box
when we've finished our work.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.594
All right, Albert, you
finish the memorandum.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.398
Oh, it's perfect.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.192
It's just perfect.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.113
Don't you think, Dash?

16:21.240 --> 16:23.232
I wonder if it will fit.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.552
- Mm.
- Very well.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.157
Well, aren't you going to finish
the memorandum?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.630
You're not going to let me look in the box?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.352
Say please.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.596
Please, Victoria, open the box.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.152
Open it.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.432
Aren't you going to try it on?

16:59.920 --> 17:01.912
Fits you perfectly.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.435
What do you think, Dash?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.592
Do you like it? Hm?

17:08.480 --> 17:09.960
My liege.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.630
<i>Is Her Majesty so naive</i>

17:18.800 --> 17:22.476
<i>that she believes her patronage
to the weavers of Spitalfields</i>

17:22.640 --> 17:26.429
<i>might house the countless women
and children on her streets?</i>

17:26.880 --> 17:31.238
<i>How does that benefit the poor people
and weavers of Spitalfields</i>

17:31.400 --> 17:37.397
that their Queen wears a costume to a ball
of a value of Â£64,000?

17:39.200 --> 17:40.793
Answer, sir!

17:41.480 --> 17:42.834
Answer the question!

17:43.000 --> 17:44.400
Answer the question!

17:48.280 --> 17:51.273
<i>For once, Sir Robert is speechless.
Shame on you, sir!</i>

17:51.440 --> 17:55.036
<i>I stand today to speak for those
who shall no longer be forgotten.</i>

17:55.200 --> 17:56.270
<i>Sit down, I say, sir.</i>

17:56.440 --> 18:00.070
<i>The millions amongst whom we live
shall no longer be left to starve.</i>

18:00.240 --> 18:03.039
<i>The Queen is doing
what she thinks is right for the country.</i>

18:03.200 --> 18:07.558
<i>It has become clear that the keepers of
wealth are not the keepers of compassion.</i>

18:07.720 --> 18:13.159
<i>In their rancid extravagance,
they expose their callous inhumanity.</i>

18:13.320 --> 18:15.232
<i>Shame on you, sir.</i>

18:15.400 --> 18:16.675
<i>Shame on you!</i>

18:16.840 --> 18:20.800
<i>What have the Whigs ever done
for the poor people of this country, sir?</i>

18:20.960 --> 18:23.077
<i>Order! Order!</i>

18:23.240 --> 18:27.792
<i>What the past tells us,
the future will confirm.</i>

18:27.960 --> 18:31.556
<i>The people will take back
what is justly theirs.</i>

19:20.000 --> 19:22.674
Don't the Queen and the Prince
look magnificent, Aunt.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.797
Like something out of Walter Scott.

19:24.960 --> 19:29.477
This whole rigmarole is just an excuse
for the Prince to play the King.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.631
It's like a fairy tale.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.991
Yes. That's exactly what it's like.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.790
May a humble outlaw request
the pleasure of a dance?

20:38.960 --> 20:41.759
- I fear I'm out of practice, sir.
- Nonsense.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.151
Once you've learnt the
step, one never forgets.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.270
I wish I'd danced more when I was younger.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.078
Can I be of assistance, Ma'am?

21:08.240 --> 21:09.993
Thank you.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.320
Lord M.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.633
- My disguise is not very effective, it seems.
- I'm so glad you could come.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.314
Why, I see so little of you now.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.200
Well, I am no longer your Prime Minister,
Ma'am.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.999
We are both rather busy elsewhere.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.595
I suppose your orchids
must be very time-consuming.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.752
Very.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.231
I did wonder if you might be unwell.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.074
Illness is for people
with nothing better to do, Ma'am.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.357
Then you have no excuse
for not answering my letters.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.672
Well, I would if I thought you
really needed my counsel, Ma'am.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.639
But you're quite capable now
of going your own way.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.237
You don't need me to tell you
when you're doing the right thing.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.392
I see.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.117
Perhaps you are right, Lord Melbourne.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.034
After all, we cannot be as we were.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.232
No, indeed.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.832
Shall we join the party?

22:20.640 --> 22:24.270
You see. You remember the steps perfectly.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.275
Well, you, I feel sure,
have been practising.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.635
You know, Harriet, nothing has changed.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.593
- May I write to you, please?
- There's no point.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.240
Then why are you dancing with me?

22:48.680 --> 22:50.672
Because I cannot forget.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.072
A magnificent spectacle, Ma'am.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.074
My current Prime Minister thinks
it's altogether too splendid.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.232
But look at all the beautiful silk.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.152
Woven especially for the occasion.

23:31.280 --> 23:36.196
I want this ball to be a symbol
of how the Crown can help the people.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.158
You make a very persuasive case, Ma'am.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.754
And you agree with me?

23:39.920 --> 23:43.311
I think the ball has
many admirable features.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.472
I wanted him to have his own crown.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.872
I'm sure he's very grateful, Ma'am.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.032
As I'm sure are the silk weavers.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.912
You don't talk like you used to.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.792
I'm out of practice, Ma'am.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.273
Shall we dance?

24:05.440 --> 24:08.751
After all, it won't be long
until my dancing days are over.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.913
- I would like to, Ma'am, but...
- But it's a waltz, Lord M.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.991
In that case, we must seize the moment.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.479
You know,
all those years growing up in Kensington,

24:29.640 --> 24:31.996
I never knew what it meant to be happy.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.833
But you knew it was possible.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.992
Oh, I knew I would make my own way.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.354
One day.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.512
There could be no doubt about that, Ma'am.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.120
I really do think that
you and the Prince...

24:46.200 --> 24:47.919
.. are just what the country needs.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.560
You're a beacon of...

24:50.320 --> 24:51.800
You're a beacon of...

24:53.880 --> 24:55.872
- Oh...
- Whatever is the matter?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.070
Oh...

24:58.240 --> 25:00.357
- The Prince is asking for you, Ma'am.
- It can wait.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.718
No... Ma'am. He is most insistent.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.556
You don't miss much, do you, Emma?

25:21.400 --> 25:23.551
I have spent my life watching you, William.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.438
O, what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,

25:32.600 --> 25:35.957
alone and palely loitering?

25:36.120 --> 25:38.555
Why aren't you in there
delighting the damsels?

25:38.720 --> 25:40.712
I don't know, Lord Alfred.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.320
Why aren't you?

26:02.440 --> 26:05.114
Look at all those people.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.954
What are they doing, Mrs Skerrett?

26:08.120 --> 26:10.794
Dreaming of a decent meal
and a warm bed, I expect.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.680
"Now is the winter
of our discontent."

26:18.000 --> 26:19.992
Albert.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.359
Are you feeling the weight
of it already, Albert?

27:33.320 --> 27:34.595
Well...

27:36.520 --> 27:38.876
I think my outlaw days are over.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.832
Such a waste.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.912
Yes, Ma'am.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.999
I think the remains
should be distributed to the poor.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.192
Excellent idea, Ma'am.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.679
Mr Speaker!

28:39.840 --> 28:43.880
According to the Morning Chronicle,
the weavers of Spitalfields

28:44.040 --> 28:45.997
"will dine for a day or two

28:46.160 --> 28:51.110
and the ball over,
they relapse into brooding on doorsteps."

28:53.520 --> 28:55.159
Order! Order!

28:57.520 --> 29:00.991
Pages of criticism,
but nothing about the real purpose.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.197
I wish I'd never held the stupid ball.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.831
Really, why can't people see
I was only trying to help?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.880
In my experience, Ma'am,
no good deed ever goes unpunished.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.032
May I have a word, Ma'am?

29:16.680 --> 29:20.959
I wonder if I might take a leave of absence
to visit my sister.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.679
She has had a difficult confinement

29:22.840 --> 29:26.516
and I would very much like
to help in her recovery.

29:26.680 --> 29:30.959
Of course, Emma,
you must go if your sister needs you.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.192
I hope you won't stay away too long.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.475
The Duchess is not the most
congenial companion.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.233
I will come back as soon as
I am no longer needed, Ma'am.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.714
Doesn't your sister's estate
lie next to Brocket Hall?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.314
Well remembered, Ma'am.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.154
So you can see Lord M, whenever you like.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.312
That is true, Ma'am.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.120
Dash!

30:22.480 --> 30:27.032
I do not mean to interrupt,
but I wanted to say goodbye.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.429
Goodbye?

30:28.600 --> 30:33.038
I am going back to Coburg. I do not
trust my father to behave without me.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.836
And I wish you bon voyage, sir.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.550
I'm just going to check to see
if the mews has your carriage ready.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.680
Goodbye.

30:44.440 --> 30:48.070
These are for you, Miss Coke.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.470
Chopin.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.599
I have enjoyed playing with you very much.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.514
I wanted to give you something
to remember me by.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.832
I appreciate the thought, sir.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.399
But you must not only
play Chopin, Miss Coke.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.677
I do not think the Duchess would like it.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.432
No, sir.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.152
Auf Wiedersehen.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.237
You were right, Sir Robert.
I should have listened to you.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.960
To hold a ball, it was not sensitive.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.355
No, sir, it was not.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.558
I allowed myself to be persuaded.
The Queen was so determined.

31:41.720 --> 31:46.112
But er... Well, although I happened
to be wearing the crown that night,

31:46.280 --> 31:48.590
I cannot resist her,
even if I had wanted to.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.470
You do not need a crown, sir,
to do great things for this country.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.439
I'm afraid I'm not sure
that I agree with you.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.192
Take a look over here, sir.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.640
You see there?

32:03.440 --> 32:06.000
That is the site of the
new Parliament building.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.230
At the moment, nothing is being done,
because no one can agree

32:10.400 --> 32:13.950
what sort of building it should be
or how much it should cost.

32:15.160 --> 32:19.916
What this vital project
requires, sir, is a patron.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.798
A patron who is above party.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.830
A man of taste who can shape the building

32:28.000 --> 32:30.993
that will house the political
heart of this country.

32:32.160 --> 32:36.234
I believe that you are a man
who looks to the future

32:36.400 --> 32:38.596
and that is precisely what we need.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.269
Good day, Mr Bascombe, Master Bascombe.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.793
I hope I do not disturb you.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.076
Your Majesty.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.472
Such a delightful noise.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.709
Yes. We like to whistle
with them as we work.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.831
This... This is an honour
beyond my wildest dreams, Ma'am.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.274
You are busy?

33:46.280 --> 33:47.714
I can't work fast enough.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.156
Even with Nathaniel,
I can't keep up with the orders.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.357
So the ball brought you some benefit?

33:52.520 --> 33:55.479
Ah... Do you see this silk?

33:57.760 --> 33:59.638
This is Nathaniel's work.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.156
He has a real way with the thread.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.192
He will be a master weaver one day.

34:05.840 --> 34:10.437
And... Well, that's thanks to you
and your kindness, Ma'am.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.193
This is Westminster Hall,

34:16.360 --> 34:20.149
the only part of the original Parliament
building to survive the fire.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.838
Please.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.038
Lord Melbourne.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.192
Oh, Your Royal Highness.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.958
I didn't see you come in.

34:36.120 --> 34:39.511
You were in a Traumerei,
I believe, a daydream.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.558
- I think we should...
- Oh...

34:41.719 --> 34:43.598
Yes, I was...

34:43.760 --> 34:45.911
I was admiring the ceiling, sir.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.072
Ah. Please.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.831
Thank you.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.518
It's 500 years old.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.511
I gave the order to save it from the fire.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.752
I sometimes think
it's my most lasting achievement.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.079
It is magnificent.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.039
Lord Melbourne, did you know that erm...

35:09.000 --> 35:12.710
Sir Robert Peel has asked me to be
the patron of the new Parliament building?

35:12.880 --> 35:14.917
Oh. Capital idea.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.753
Oh, that's a job well worth doing.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.792
You think Parliament will listen
to the ideas of a foreign prince?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.679
Oh, well, there may be a few grumbles,

35:22.840 --> 35:25.309
but, no, I think a lot of
them will be very pleased

35:25.480 --> 35:27.995
to have a disinterested party in charge.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.152
I know you will make a good job of it.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.636
Thank you. That's very kind.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.272
I wish I had built something now.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.392
Left some sort of
impression on this country.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.153
You were the Prime Minister.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.789
Oh, any damn fool can be
Prime Minister, but...

35:47.960 --> 35:50.350
to leave behind a thing of beauty...

35:52.280 --> 35:54.272
.. something like this...

35:55.800 --> 36:01.114
.. something that...
people will marvel over centuries from now,

36:01.280 --> 36:03.078
that's...

36:04.080 --> 36:05.878
.. that's worth living for.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.037
You are in an elegiac mood, Lord Melbourne.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.152
Elegiac...

36:17.320 --> 36:19.312
Yes, I suppose I am.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.799
Please, sir, forgive me
for asking, but erm...

36:27.000 --> 36:28.992
.. are you quite well?

36:31.760 --> 36:33.797
No, I can't say that I am, sir.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.752
I can't say that I am.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.553
All alone?

36:50.760 --> 36:52.956
Emma Portman has gone to her sister's.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.633
Harriet has left
and Lord M never comes to town.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.032
I saw him today.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.953
You saw him?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.191
Was he well?

37:05.360 --> 37:08.114
At the ball, he did not quite seem himself.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.752
What is it?

37:17.600 --> 37:19.910
What is it, Albert? You
must tell me the truth.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.952
Lord Melbourne is ill. Gravely so.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.954
Why didn't he tell me?

37:31.120 --> 37:33.112
He does not want you to know.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.830
So, as you care for him,
you must say nothing.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.517
The Prince wants to see you, Mr Penge.

37:54.040 --> 37:58.796
After analysing the household accounts,
I have made two discoveries.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.156
One is that the system for ordering
defies all logic.

38:03.320 --> 38:08.156
In some instances, it appears to be
organised fraud against the Royal purse.

38:09.160 --> 38:15.396
But my second discovery is that
the Royal servants' wages are...

38:16.760 --> 38:18.513
.. uncommonly low.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.797
So, that leads me to conclude

38:20.960 --> 38:24.556
that, were those wages increased...

38:25.560 --> 38:29.270
.. then perhaps the accounts
would become more sensible.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.797
Do you believe that I am correct, Baroness?

38:32.960 --> 38:35.919
It is an interesting idea, sir.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.912
If I may say so, sir...

38:38.920 --> 38:41.833
.. you have hit the nail on the head.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.158
Her Majesty the Queen.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.480
I am glad to have caught you before
you disappeared back to Brocket Hall.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.233
Your Majesty,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.552
please allow me to apologise
for not saying good night at the ball.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.313
There is no need.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.952
Please, sit.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.037
I have brought you something.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.398
You just wind it up here...

39:43.520 --> 39:45.910
.. and you can have music

39:46.080 --> 39:48.072
whenever you want.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.752
Mozart.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.115
Your favourite.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.272
It's most ingenious, Ma'am.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.076
But may I ask, what have I done
to deserve such a magnificent gift?

40:00.920 --> 40:03.276
I thought you might like
to listen to it sometimes.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.159
Mm.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.073
When you are at Brocket Hall.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.075
I shan't be able to travel much soon.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.992
And so I wanted you to have something..

40:18.640 --> 40:20.552
.. to remind you...

40:22.200 --> 40:25.318
.. of all the fun to be had in London
when you choose to return.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.032
That's most thoughtful.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.712
It is a beautiful thing.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.197
These are such difficult times. I...

40:44.360 --> 40:45.999
I wish you were not so far away.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.836
Oh, I feel quite certain that you
can manage without me now, Ma'am.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.312
You will write to me?

41:04.040 --> 41:06.236
Yes.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.392
Yes, of course.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.157
When you return from Brocket Hall,
we must go riding in the park...

41:13.560 --> 41:15.552
.. like we used to.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.112
Such talks we had, Ma'am.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.832
I learnt so much from you, you know.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.711
You learnt from me?

41:30.880 --> 41:33.076
More than you can imagine.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.512
Goodbye, Lord M.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.276
Thank you.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.792
Oh, Liebes.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.919
Oh, I am so sorry.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.960
- He was always there.
- I know.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.312
I can't bear it.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.032
Yes, you can.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.120
He was old, Liebes.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.472
His time had come.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.512
I will miss him so much.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.317
Everything changes, Victoria.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.672
Except us.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.280
His attachment was without selfishness.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.479
His playfulness without malice.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.357
His fidelity without deceit.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.878
Reader, if you would live beloved
and die regretted...

44:36.320 --> 44:40.360
.. profit by the example of Dash.
