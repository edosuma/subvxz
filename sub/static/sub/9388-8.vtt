00:37.908 --> 00:39.249
Mom, where's Dad?

00:39.344 --> 00:40.759
Over across the street.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.221
He's collecting Cleveland's
mail while he's out of town.

00:43.256 --> 00:44.478
Black guy mail.

00:44.513 --> 00:47.097
Peter, you're just supposed
to pick up Cleveland's mail,

00:47.132 --> 00:48.211
not go through it.

00:48.246 --> 00:50.544
Lois, black people are
different than you and I.

00:50.579 --> 00:52.554
And me, I find
that hilarious.

00:52.698 --> 00:55.282
Boy, Cleveland gets
a lot of magazines.

00:55.605 --> 00:57.000
Grape Soda Today.

00:57.404 --> 00:59.018
Orange Soda Quarterly.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.708
The Fruit Punch Reader.

01:00.730 --> 01:02.313
Hey, what you got
there, Stewie?

01:02.479 --> 01:04.903
Ooh, Mustache Aficionado.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.341
Wow, look at these men.

01:07.406 --> 01:09.213
What class, what grace.

01:09.358 --> 01:11.650
And all because
of a little upper lip hair.

01:11.685 --> 01:12.350
Lois,

01:12.518 --> 01:14.482
I am going grow a mustache.

01:14.526 --> 01:16.821
Then I'll have it made
like the Monopoly guy.

01:17.107 --> 01:18.682
Except when he goes
directly to jail.

01:19.408 --> 01:22.271
I wish I could tell you
that the Monopoly guy

01:22.316 --> 01:25.143
fought the good fight
and the Sisters let him be.

01:25.295 --> 01:27.151
I wish I could tell you that.

01:27.308 --> 01:30.172
But prison is no
fairy-tale world.

01:34.487 --> 01:36.273
Hey, Rupert,
what if the refrigerator

01:36.316 --> 01:38.071
was a monster that
talked like this?

01:38.795 --> 01:39.792
I am a monster.

01:40.085 --> 01:42.230
I am going to bite
your fingers.

01:42.388 --> 01:43.492
Here I come.

01:43.525 --> 01:44.822
I'm going to get you.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.002
Ah! I don't want to play anymore

01:46.037 --> 01:47.151
Normal voice, normal voice!

01:47.187 --> 01:48.261
The refrigerator can't hurt me.

01:48.307 --> 01:49.123
Okay?

01:49.846 --> 01:52.281
Oh, my God, Dad,
what's on your face?

01:52.437 --> 01:54.011
It's a mustache, Meg.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.300
Oh, I think it's sexy.

01:56.347 --> 01:57.472
I think it's gay.

01:57.515 --> 01:58.573
It's not gay, Brian.

01:58.605 --> 02:00.761
If I'm gay, then
Freddie Mercury was gay.

02:00.797 --> 02:02.912
Freddie Mercury
the lead singer of Queen?

02:02.968 --> 02:04.063
He was incredibly gay.

02:04.135 --> 02:04.812
He was not!

02:04.855 --> 02:07.800
He had a mustache
which is praal like wedding ring

02:07.847 --> 02:10.330
I imagine you're going to be
much more of a stern father,

02:10.377 --> 02:11.630
now that you have a mustache.

02:11.676 --> 02:14.250
Well, Chris, there may bemore lap sitting
than there'sn.

02:14.297 --> 02:16.843
And I might answer most of
your questions with a story.

02:16.877 --> 02:18.671
But, mostly,my mustache tells people

02:18.707 --> 02:21.582
that there is a 90% chance
that I am poorly educated,

02:21.806 --> 02:24.732
that I keep upscale pornziou the open

02:24.746 --> 02:27.570
and that I listen tothe Little River Band
with giant headphones.

02:27.617 --> 02:31.343
Ugh! That's the ugliest thing the Fatman's grown
since that horse leg.

02:31.916 --> 02:33.353
Hey, Peter, have you seen my...

02:33.495 --> 02:36.083
Aw, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?

02:36.116 --> 02:37.901
Do not stand behin me.

02:38.108 --> 02:39.902
Because I will get scared.

02:43.557 --> 02:45.562
And now back to One Tree Hill.

02:45.805 --> 02:47.860
Dude, let me tell
you something:

02:48.007 --> 02:51.373
There is nothing that'll ever
happen in the rest of our lives

02:51.418 --> 02:54.753
that's as important as what's
going on right here, right now,

02:54.786 --> 02:57.040
in high school,
by these lockers.

02:57.088 --> 02:59.051
I've got so many problems.

02:59.207 --> 03:02.643
Hey, nothing that can't be
fixed by staringa.

03:02.807 --> 03:10.202
High school is sucha serious thing
These problems matter.

03:11.697 --> 03:13.841
God, these high school
students are lame.

03:13.996 --> 03:16.282
I'm a freakin' baby, andI'm cooler than they are.

03:16.328 --> 03:17.720
What the hell do youknow about high school?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.691
Are you kidding?

03:18.736 --> 03:20.990
These kids today areso easy to manipulate.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.320
If you plopped me inthe middle of a high school,

03:23.365 --> 03:25.331

03:25.375 --> 03:26.051

07:27.305 --> 07:28.802
What isthat on your head?

07:28.836 --> 07:30.260
It's a mustache, Lois.

07:30.307 --> 07:32.131
What, you never seena mustache before?

07:32.167 --> 07:34.172
Lois, would you mind callingthe police

07:34.218 --> 07:35.182
Quiet, mustache!

07:41.256 --> 07:44.083
No. I'm not living my life without a mustache.

07:44.236 --> 07:47.670
Even if, sometimes,my mustache
has Alpo gas

07:47.715 --> 07:49.110
Mustache fart.

07:51.128 --> 07:53.131
Hello, I'm lookingfor Peter Griffin.

07:53.166 --> 07:53.961

07:53.998 --> 07:55.972
Mr. Griffin, my nameis Todd Meyers.

07:56.006 --> 07:58.262
I'm the man you rescuedfrom McBurgertown.

07:58.306 --> 08:00.801
Oh yeah,
you're the guywho cost me my mustache.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.312
What, you come over here to rape
my daughter?

08:03.328 --> 08:06.593
No, I own the restaurant,
and to show my gratitude,

08:06.638 --> 08:11.001
I'd like to offer you
a lifetimesupply of McBurgertown burgers.

08:11.805 --> 08:12.913
Free burgers?

08:12.945 --> 08:16.532
Oh, man, this isa way better offer
than the one I gotfrom Helen Hunt.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.263
You wanna have sex?

08:18.548 --> 08:20.273

08:30.616 --> 08:32.181
Peter, you shouldreally slow down.

08:32.227 --> 08:33.760
You've already hadlike 30 hamburgers.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.453
Shut up, Brian.

08:34.488 --> 08:36.780
It relieves the painof mustachelessness.

08:37.505 --> 08:38.611
And it's working.

08:38.655 --> 08:40.340
I no longer feel the pain.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.669
Come to think of it,I can't really feel anything

08:42.706 --> 08:44.251
on the left half of my body.

08:44.285 --> 08:44.963
Really?

08:45.007 --> 08:46.541
That doesn'tsound good.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.550
Peter, are youwinking at me?

08:51.356 --> 08:53.442
Oh, my God, someonecall an ambulance!

08:59.328 --> 09:01.873
Mrs. Griffin, your husbandhas had a stroke.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.921
The left half of his bodyis completely paralyzed.

Oh, my God!

09:06.366 --> 09:08.511

09:55.366 --> 09:56.443

10:00.826 --> 10:02.181

10:14.637 --> 10:15.262
That's what.

10:15.308 --> 10:16.231
No, but seriously,

10:16.278 --> 10:17.732
there's something I wantto talk to you about.

10:17.765 --> 10:19.991
Sure, Zac.Anything for you.

10:20.025 --> 10:21.750
You wanna go out toAnal Point this weekend,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.303
see what all thebuzz is about?

10:23.338 --> 10:24.872
OMG!

10:24.905 --> 10:27.061
That'd be so awesome!
Sweet.

10:27.108 --> 10:29.183
We're gonna havea real ragin' time.

10:29.218 --> 10:31.381
Before you know it,
we'll belike an old married couple.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.153
- Uh, Lois?
- Yeah?

10:59.297 --> 11:01.500
Uh, Peter's getting in the car.

11:07.308 --> 11:08.462
...baffled, trumped,tethered, cropped

11:08.508 --> 11:12.292
Look at that low plane,fine then, uh-oh, overflow

11:12.328 --> 11:14.013
Population, common food,but it'll do

11:14.055 --> 11:15.063
Shave yourself,serve yourself

11:15.106 --> 11:17.423
World serves its own needs,listen to your heartbeat

11:17.466 --> 11:20.103
Dummy with the rapture and therevered and the right, right

11:20.138 --> 11:22.650
Your vitriolic, patriotic,slam, fight, bright light

11:22.685 --> 11:24.461
Feeling pretty psyched

11:24.506 --> 11:28.663
It's the end of the worldas we know it...

11:33.836 --> 11:36.990
Stroke, stroke,stroke!

11:37.028 --> 11:39.000
Stop mocking me!

11:43.885 --> 11:45.280
Well, Brian, you'velost your bet.

11:45.328 --> 11:48.150
I- or rather, myalter ego, Zac Sawyer-

11:48.198 --> 11:51.060
am currently the most popular boy
at James Woods High.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.583
Well, Stewie, you got
the best of meon this one.

11:53.607 --> 11:54.803
Congratulations.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.803
I guess you'll behanging up your wig now?

11:56.845 --> 11:57.630
Oh, no, Brian.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.353
I'm enjoyingmyself to much

11:59.397 --> 12:01.083
Do you know thatI've got a date

12:01.118 --> 12:03.983
with Connie D'Amico
this Saturday night,at Anal Point?

12:04.108 --> 12:05.953
Ah, I've heardabout that place.

12:05.988 --> 12:06.991
Really?What's it like?

12:07.036 --> 12:08.001
'Cause I haveno idea.

12:08.018 --> 12:13.170
Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it
like a parking spacethat you think,

12:13.215 --> 12:15.472
"Gosh, there's no way
I'm gonna be ableto fit in there."

12:16.008 --> 12:17.902
But then you fold inthe sideview mirrors and

12:17.938 --> 12:19.491
sure enough,well, look at that.

12:19.616 --> 12:21.501
Well, in that scenario,
it sounds like I'd rather be

12:21.546 --> 12:22.903
the parking spacethan the car.

12:22.945 --> 12:24.661
Yeah, that's whatI've always guessed.

12:28.686 --> 12:30.983
I hate being all strokey.

12:31.275 --> 12:33.851
This is all your fault,McBurgertown.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.452
You and your delicioushamburgers!

12:36.495 --> 12:39.020
I swearI'll get back at you someday

12:39.315 --> 12:42.432
for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.

12:42.478 --> 12:47.893
I would gladlypay you Tuesday
for a hamburger today.

12:47.926 --> 12:52.231
If only there were some way
I could belike everybody else again.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.603
How long was I in there?

13:08.637 --> 13:09.711
About five minutes.

13:09.757 --> 13:12.053
Why are we notfunding this?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.782
Sweetheart, that's incredible.

13:16.828 --> 13:18.623
And it only took five minutes?

13:18.655 --> 13:20.573
Five minutes.I went in there
they injected me

13:20.616 --> 13:22.500
with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam

13:22.538 --> 13:24.062
good ol'gambling man Peter.

13:24.108 --> 13:26.693
And now I can
take my revengeon McBurger Town.

13:26.736 --> 13:27.521
Wait. What?

13:27.555 --> 13:29.561
It's their fault
I had a stroke, Brian.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.161
And I'm gonna sue 'em for it.

13:31.306 --> 13:32.723
Peter, you ate 30 hamburgers.

13:32.766 --> 13:33.842
It was your own fault.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.123
Yeah, besides, Peter,

13:35.125 --> 13:37.601
those companies have
huge legal divisions.

13:37.645 --> 13:38.752
You can't fight that.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.762
I'll find a way with the help

13:40.808 --> 13:42.203
of my snarky cat lawyer

13:42.238 --> 13:43.312
Meowsy McDermott.

13:43.358 --> 13:45.071
You've got to be kitten me!

13:45.107 --> 13:46.511
Ha!

13:51.105 --> 13:53.741
This court finds in
favor of the defendant,

13:53.747 --> 13:55.121
McBurgertown Industries.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.151
What?! Hey, come on!
That's not fair!

13:57.187 --> 13:59.112
Mr. Griffin, what did you expect?

13:59.148 --> 14:01.033
They have a hundred lawyers,

14:01.035 --> 14:02.712
and you tried to bribe me

14:02.755 --> 14:05.441
with a subscription to Grape Soda Today

14:05.445 --> 14:06.901
which I already have.

14:06.938 --> 14:08.333
Case dismissed.

14:10.927 --> 14:12.032
What did I tell you, Peter?

14:12.077 --> 14:13.391
One man can't take on a

14:13.396 --> 14:15.513
multinational fast food conglomerate.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.060
Oh, yes, I can.
This ain't over, Brian.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.202
Those people are bad and

14:19.217 --> 14:20.683
I'm gonna prove it to the world.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.123
How do you expect to do that?

14:22.156 --> 14:23.231
Are you kidding?

14:23.278 --> 14:24.950
I've tackled tougher jobs before.

14:24.995 --> 14:26.520
Remember that time I was Robin

14:26.526 --> 14:27.950
Williams' jumping-off point?

14:28.446 --> 14:30.702
- Okay... religion.
- Oh, religion.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.700
You kill me, I kill you,
we both go to heaven.

14:32.736 --> 14:34.660
72 virgins, huh!

14:34.707 --> 14:35.533
You might have to help me out

14:35.538 --> 14:36.191
with the last ten or so

14:36.226 --> 14:38.770
because Mr. Happy
gets tired- religion.

14:40.286 --> 14:41.283
Politics.

14:41.365 --> 14:45.090
Well, we're gonna come down there
and take all your oil.

14:45.138 --> 14:46.210
But this is our oil.

14:46.246 --> 14:48.220
Yee-haw!
Well, here's my missile.

14:48.257 --> 14:50.261
Okay, take it, take it.
Politics.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.951
Uh, you know what?

14:51.987 --> 14:53.130
I'm gonna take a
five-minute break.

14:53.178 --> 14:54.251
Huh, five-minute break.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.862
What are you,
a construction worker?

14:55.907 --> 14:57.411
Hey, baby, I'm not gay.

14:57.445 --> 14:59.350
Does this yellow hat make
my ass look fat?

14:59.386 --> 15:00.550
Five-minute break.

15:03.768 --> 15:05.162
You enjoyed the movie, baby?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.981
Yeah, but I think I'm gonna

15:06.987 --> 15:08.371
enjoy this even more.

15:08.665 --> 15:10.512
Ugh! No, thanks.
I am stuffed.

15:10.555 --> 15:12.302
So, we just gonna sit here and talk

15:12.306 --> 15:13.403
or are we gonna do it?

15:13.436 --> 15:15.531
All right, baby,
those are the magic words.

15:15.955 --> 15:16.971
Now check this out!

15:17.405 --> 15:18.692
Oh, my God!

15:18.907 --> 15:20.961
Yeah, I am ready for sex.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.001
I drank eight gallons
of water today.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.751
This baby's ready to explode.

15:25.205 --> 15:26.001
Is..

15:26.107 --> 15:28.463
is there more underneath
of is that it?

15:28.496 --> 15:29.211
I'm sorry?

15:31.626 --> 15:34.493
Zac, just get the hel
lout of my car.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.160
That's it?
That was sex?

15:41.208 --> 15:41.941
What a rip-off.

15:41.945 --> 15:42.780
I should sue her.

15:42.828 --> 15:45.400
Be careful you're not held
in contempt of cat.

15:51.438 --> 15:51.903
Pardon me.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.181
We're two Asian businessmen

15:53.185 --> 15:53.980
looking to invest

15:54.026 --> 15:55.323
in McBurgertown Industries

15:55.326 --> 15:57.180
and we'd like a tour of your facility.

15:57.215 --> 15:58.293
You don't look Asian.

15:58.328 --> 16:00.103
Well, I guess we'll just take

16:00.105 --> 16:02.062
our millions of Dongs elsewhere.

16:02.096 --> 16:03.171
Wait, wait!

16:03.215 --> 16:04.933
Let me get our
general manager.

16:05.508 --> 16:07.801
Peter, what the hell do you
expect to accomplish here?

16:07.845 --> 16:08.910
Evidence, Brian.

16:08.956 --> 16:10.641
I'm gonna find just
the right piece

16:10.677 --> 16:13.250
of incriminating evidence to
bring down this company.

16:14.198 --> 16:16.670
Over here is a menu from our first

16:16.676 --> 16:19.001
McBurgertown restaurant in 1952.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.441
At that time, our value meal

16:20.446 --> 16:21.702
consisted of a hamburger,

16:21.737 --> 16:23.602
a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.

16:23.907 --> 16:25.852
Wow. How much did all that cost?

16:25.886 --> 16:27.802
Back in the '50s,
one straw penny.

16:27.835 --> 16:30.782
- A whole strawpenny?
- Indeed. Follow me.

16:32.507 --> 16:33.611
Hey, what's in there?

16:33.656 --> 16:35.340
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's off limit.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.063
Now if you'll excuse me for a second,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.430
I have to go to the bathroom

16:38.438 --> 16:39.390
for about 30 minutes

16:39.436 --> 16:40.792
as I eat a lot of meat.

16:40.836 --> 16:42.131
Please give me your word that

16:42.135 --> 16:43.301
you won't go in that door.

16:43.327 --> 16:43.952
Okay.

16:43.996 --> 16:45.423
Good.
See you in a half hour.

16:46.577 --> 16:48.081
Peter, this is your chance!

16:48.127 --> 16:49.562
Brian, I gave him my word.

16:49.606 --> 16:50.262
The hell with that.

16:50.266 --> 16:51.450
Let's see what's behind this door.

16:55.196 --> 16:56.871
My God, what is this?!

16:56.916 --> 16:59.493
This must be the
McBurgertown slaughterhouse.

16:59.607 --> 17:01.600
Sir, you are correct.

17:01.798 --> 17:03.853
But in here, we call it "DaCow."

17:03.886 --> 17:05.403
- DaCow?
- DaCow.

17:05.506 --> 17:08.073
Except we spell the
"chau" part C-O-W,

17:08.117 --> 17:12.702
Like "cow," so it's
kind of a... eh, sort of a dark joke.

17:12.748 --> 17:14.433
Yeah, yeah, it's a Holocaust joke.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.859
That's, that's really funny.

17:15.905 --> 17:17.390
Unfortunately, life in a

17:17.396 --> 17:19.700
slaughterhouse is no laughing matter.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.682
They have killed a great many of us,

17:22.685 --> 17:24.771
including my beloved wife.

17:24.906 --> 17:25.882
Peter, this is it.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.641
This is the evidence
you've been looking for.

17:27.926 --> 17:30.513
If we can get you out of here,
would you be willing to testify

17:30.548 --> 17:32.203
publicly about these atrocities?

17:32.238 --> 17:33.243
Oh, absolutely.

17:33.247 --> 17:35.392
But how do you intend to escape?

17:35.455 --> 17:38.260
You leave that to us.
Come on.

17:41.716 --> 17:42.501
Hey!

17:42.705 --> 17:44.292
There they are!
After them!

18:22.787 --> 18:29.381
<i>Here in status symbol land...</i>

18:38.285 --> 18:40.013
Hey, hey, what's up, Lucas?

18:41.005 --> 18:42.310
What the hell's your problem?

18:42.606 --> 18:44.602
Hey, Logan, what's going on?

18:45.106 --> 18:46.502
What the hell is going on here?

18:46.535 --> 18:48.400
Nothing, baby penis.

18:50.356 --> 18:51.502
Well, yes, I have a baby-

18:53.228 --> 18:54.560
Well, for your information,

18:54.566 --> 18:55.800
I don't want a big penis.

18:55.847 --> 18:57.532
I think they're messy.

18:59.107 --> 19:00.610
Well, you've effectively ended

19:00.647 --> 19:02.121
my reign of coolness,
haven't you?

19:02.417 --> 19:03.813
You're a disgrace,
you know that?

19:03.848 --> 19:06.142
Hey, you're the one
with the tiny penis.

19:06.807 --> 19:08.733
You know, Connie, look,
you're right.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.852
I behaved like a fool.
And I apologize.

19:11.888 --> 19:13.010
But, before I go,

19:13.018 --> 19:15.202
could I maybe have one last kiss?

19:15.605 --> 19:17.631
Well, I guess so.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.503
Look, this girl
is making out with a baby!

19:23.538 --> 19:25.101
A nude baby!

19:27.396 --> 19:28.201
Hey!

19:29.128 --> 19:30.552
That's right.
To hell with you all!

19:30.908 --> 19:32.562
I am who I am.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.012
<i>Here comes the story

19:37.007 --> 19:40.033
<i>The man the authorities
came to blame</i>

19:40.656 --> 19:43.193
<i>For something that he never done...</i>

19:46.637 --> 19:47.783
Quiet, everybody, this is it.

19:47.907 --> 19:50.052
The McBurgertown
franchise suffered

19:50.088 --> 19:52.602
a publicity setback today
from which it may not recover,

19:52.707 --> 19:54.530
thanks to testimony regarding

19:54.538 --> 19:56.693
its practices by a very brave cow.

19:57.108 --> 20:00.262
I have revealed to you,
today, these horrors

20:00.308 --> 20:03.003
in the hope that you will
see the need for change.

20:03.297 --> 20:06.163
But always remember what
I have done here today

20:06.206 --> 20:08.422
is not a courageous act.

20:08.466 --> 20:11.331
The courage lies with a
man who has the guts

20:11.377 --> 20:13.973
to say no to a fast food restaurant

20:13.476 --> 20:16.500
and eat a salad instead.

20:16.505 --> 20:19.453
To say, "I will eat
this salad with pride.

20:19.456 --> 20:22.270
I don't care if I look
like a gay person."

20:22.308 --> 20:25.121
So to all of you
salad-eating homosexuals,

20:25.156 --> 20:27.133
I say thank you.

20:27.705 --> 20:30.460
And thank you, Peter,
for all you've done

20:30.468 --> 20:32.873
to help expose
this grave injustice.

20:33.077 --> 20:35.171
Where will you go now,
Mr. Cow?

20:35.207 --> 20:36.322
I cannot stay here?

20:36.407 --> 20:38.333
Peter said I could stay here.

20:38.408 --> 20:41.200
Oh... gosh...yeah, I don't,

20:41.407 --> 20:43.501
I don't really see how
that's gonna work out.

20:43.906 --> 20:48.771
Oh. Well, as I said,
Peter just promised...

20:48.957 --> 20:50.182
Yeah, I should stop you there.

20:50.186 --> 20:51.542
I didn't really promise anything.

20:51.575 --> 20:54.282
I just said "Maybe, if it was okay with Lois."

20:54.327 --> 20:56.990
Boy, it just it seems like
a real burden to me.

20:57.607 --> 21:01.012
Well, this is pretty awkward.

21:03.608 --> 21:07.910
Ciaoooooo...
