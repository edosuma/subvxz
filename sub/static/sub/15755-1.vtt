I don't know why you're not

This is South America, man. Is what
our lives have been leading up to.

01:36.606 --> 01:39.072
I do think it's been great.

01:39.155 --> 01:42.929
I just don't think it's like...
The only option.

01:43.109 --> 01:44.704
Dude, what the fuck else
is there to do, man?

01:45.021 --> 01:47.289
You do the gap year, do Uni.
Then you go find a job...

01:47.290 --> 01:49.030
- ...and then have a life.
- That's what everyone's doing, Tommy.

01:49.031 --> 01:52.239
What about, you know, the paths
less trodden and all that?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.923
What, Thailand? Are you kidding me?

01:53.924 --> 01:55.463
Are you joking? We've spoken about this.

01:55.471 --> 01:57.938
We've spoken about the ladyboy
thing, and how freaky that is.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.247
Freaks you out!

02:00.297 --> 02:01.347
Yeah.

02:03.536 --> 02:04.586
It's cool that, isn't it?

02:05.245 --> 02:07.133
Oh, it's a bit arty.
All I've seen so far...

02:07.206 --> 02:08.604
...is a bit of side-boob.

02:08.898 --> 02:09.948
It's ID magazine.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.225
It's not that sort of thing.

02:11.227 --> 02:12.839
Yeah, clearly, but
this edition just checked...

02:12.927 --> 02:15.547
...a couple of trendy titty pics only
for the lads, get 'em going,...

02:15.840 --> 02:16.890
...and you'll boost sales.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.030
Jack, Jack.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.561
People are here. Can you and Tom
please come downstairs and says hello?

02:20.625 --> 02:21.675
Yeah, I'll come down.

02:22.115 --> 02:24.482
Oh, you are a sweetie. Thanks, Tom.

02:25.118 --> 02:27.729
- Come on, Jack. Come on.
- Coming.

02:38.529 --> 02:43.152
Right, now, plenty of
opportunities here, Jack.

02:43.518 --> 02:45.674
Right? Come on.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.898
- Jack.
- Hi, Mr. Walker.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.662
How are you, Mrs. Walker?

02:52.663 --> 02:54.642
Nice to see you.

02:54.723 --> 02:56.774
I haven't seen you since
you finished school.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.370
Congratulations on getting
into Bristol. It's fantastic.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.080
Oh, thank you very much.

03:01.202 --> 03:02.284
What are you going to read?

03:02.301 --> 03:04.181
Uh, I'm going to read history...

03:04.424 --> 03:07.024
- ...at the moment.
- And then a law conversion.

03:07.025 --> 03:09.695
So he'll be coming your way
for a job soon, Bill.

03:10.805 --> 03:12.214
Yes, when your father mentioned that...

03:12.216 --> 03:13.898
...you're interested
in doing an internship.

03:14.784 --> 03:15.932
It'll be good to have a straight...

03:16.078 --> 03:18.463
...down-the-line chap
like you about the place.

03:18.478 --> 03:22.310
Oh, oh, thank you, yeah.
Um, I mean,...

03:22.311 --> 03:23.403
...I'm not sure whether...

03:23.405 --> 03:25.556
Ah, come on now, Jack.
Don't be modest.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.159
I'm sure we can find
something for you to do.

03:28.161 --> 03:29.527
I appreciate it, Bill.

03:30.705 --> 03:32.831
So, you're taking a gap year?

03:32.833 --> 03:35.745
Yes. Yeah, yeah, I am. With
Tom, which will be great.

03:35.746 --> 03:39.526
I'm sort of hoping it, uh, turns
into more of a gap life, really.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.621
Hello there, sir,
can I talk to you for a sec?

03:45.622 --> 03:50.270
Lovely to meet you.
Take care. Alright. Bye, bye.

03:50.287 --> 03:51.401
Smash.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.487
The grandmas, mate, they just love you.

03:53.663 --> 03:56.074
No, they're wise.
They know what's good.

03:59.248 --> 04:01.957
Tom? Tom.

04:05.956 --> 04:10.164
Fuck off. Fuck off.
You've gotta go and speak to her.

04:10.663 --> 04:14.243
- I'm not gonna speak to her.
- No, you have to. Come on.

04:14.413 --> 04:15.948
I don't wanna do it.
I don't know what to say.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.744
I don't know, just mention
her Spice Girls jacket.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.156
Um, excuse me, miss?

04:34.496 --> 04:36.933
Uh, uh, I was wondering
if I could have, um,...

04:36.935 --> 04:39.162
...uh, time, a couple
of your minutes to, uh...

04:39.329 --> 04:42.493
...a couple of minutes to talk
about the London Heart Trust?

04:42.663 --> 04:45.448
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

04:45.517 --> 04:49.219
Uh, uh, so what do you,
what do you wanna know?

04:50.454 --> 04:53.260
I'm sure that's not
what you're meant to say.

04:53.263 --> 04:55.825
Oh, uh, no, it's not, actually. Um...

04:55.997 --> 04:58.515
Uh, so, uh, we at the London
Heart Trust, uh, we're trying...

04:58.517 --> 05:01.891
...to gain funding for
new research and, um...

05:01.892 --> 05:04.974
Are you gonna say
these are gonna kill me?

05:07.392 --> 05:10.368
Uh, well, that wasn't actually
in the speech but, um...

05:10.370 --> 05:11.803
They're awful for you.

05:11.804 --> 05:13.142
Right.

05:13.143 --> 05:15.479
Sorry Jack, I was wonde...
Oh my God, you're with a customer.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.781
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:16.851 --> 05:18.760
- I am Tom.
- Evelyn.

05:18.761 --> 05:20.391
- Jack.
- Good, we got names sorted.

05:20.392 --> 05:23.474
So, um, are you, are you
gonna sign up with us today?

05:23.475 --> 05:25.265
No, I don't think so.

05:28.684 --> 05:32.724
Well, if you've got five minutes, I can
take a break if you wanna grab a coffee.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.718
- Well, I'm afraid I'm meeting someone.
- Brutal.

05:38.143 --> 05:40.927
But you could walk me to that corner?

05:41.726 --> 05:44.510
To the corner? Yeah, sure.
To the corner.

05:49.642 --> 05:52.446
- So you're from France?
- Yes, I'm from Paris.

05:52.621 --> 05:55.718
Oh, Paris. But you live here?
Oh, nice.

05:57.101 --> 05:58.598
I like the jacket, by the way.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.683
Thanks.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.390
Which one would you be?

06:02.767 --> 06:03.964
I'd be Scary.

06:04.142 --> 06:05.734
No, you wouldn't.

06:05.736 --> 06:08.049
What, don't tell me
you think I'd be Posh?

06:08.621 --> 06:10.741
No, Baby.

06:10.743 --> 06:14.183
Baby? Oh. She's the cutest one.
I'll take that.

06:16.934 --> 06:19.137
What do you do?

06:19.308 --> 06:23.254
This at the moment. Just charity.
And then, uh, traveling with Tom...

06:23.434 --> 06:24.801
...and then probably...

06:24.803 --> 06:28.341
No, I mean, like, what do you do?
What do you like?

06:28.475 --> 06:31.933
What do I, what do I...?
Oh, I, I don't know.

06:33.350 --> 06:35.756
You're not good at small talk, are you?

06:35.830 --> 06:39.278
Yeah, it's... it's feeling
that way, isn't it?

06:39.976 --> 06:42.298
It's okay. It's useless.

06:44.684 --> 06:47.931
- Well, this is me.
- Oh, sure.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.672
- Oh, it was, it was nice to meet you.
- Me too, Jack.

06:50.674 --> 06:51.531
Okay.

06:54.517 --> 06:58.307
And, Jack, if you're ever knocking
about, come to The Fiddler's Green.

06:58.892 --> 07:02.423
- What's that?
- It's a pub on Frithville Place.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.581
Sure. Okay.

07:09.684 --> 07:11.058
See you.

07:18.642 --> 07:22.339
Well, tell me. Come on. Tell me what
happened, man. What did she say?

07:22.517 --> 07:26.547
She just said, uh, there's a pub.
Come to... Obviously, you're gonna go.

07:26.549 --> 07:33.345
- You think so?
- Yes. Course you should go.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.591
Imagine when we're at the top
of Machu Picchu, just lapping up...

07:37.593 --> 07:39.764
...all those beautiful vistas.

07:39.934 --> 07:41.719
Did you say "beautiful vistas"?

07:41.721 --> 07:43.976
There are gonna be beautiful vistas.

07:44.142 --> 07:48.135
Oh, a seven. Go on.
Mate, that's not too exciting...

07:48.309 --> 07:50.269
...think about all those
beautiful Brazilian women.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.510
You keep saying this.

07:51.684 --> 07:54.931
I'm not sure why Brazilian women are
so great. How many do you know?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.530
Not a lot. That's the whole point.

07:56.532 --> 07:58.549
So how do you know
they're gonna be great?

07:58.726 --> 08:01.480
I don't understand why you're
even asking that question.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.514
Why do you think they won't be?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.006
Oh, she's a, she's a six.

08:06.008 --> 08:08.805
No. My judgment is terrible.
She's a four. She's horrible.

08:08.976 --> 08:11.512
I'm not saying that they won't be,
I'm saying they'll be...

08:11.514 --> 08:14.048
...ugly, but there are some
beautiful women in the UK, too.

08:14.225 --> 08:17.741
And I know that you're expecting every
single one to look like Adriana Lima.

08:17.743 --> 08:18.886
That's your only reference point.

08:18.893 --> 08:21.328
And Gisele. Some might look like her.
And completely I'm fine with that.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.141
I'm cool with it.

08:22.142 --> 08:24.678
- You'll make do, okay.
- Okay, here's a thing.

08:24.851 --> 08:28.346
Name me one Brazilian girl
that isn't hot?

08:28.517 --> 08:31.515
- I don't know any Brazilian women.
- Apart from Adriana and Gisele?

08:31.684 --> 08:32.716
Apart from them, yeah.

08:32.717 --> 08:35.299
Exactly! So we're operating
at 100% success rate!

08:35.475 --> 08:39.006
Oh, 7.5. Look at her. Wow.

08:40.517 --> 08:43.027
I might, um, I might
Shag Issi before that.

08:43.029 --> 08:45.424
Just get, you know,
get some practice in.

08:46.434 --> 08:48.009
How's that going for you?

08:48.183 --> 08:51.217
I mean, it's, you know,
I'm just playing the long game.

08:51.392 --> 08:54.758
I don't get it, man. Issi's sort
of a bitch to you, isn't she?

08:54.934 --> 08:56.192
And you've been trying it for ages.

08:56.194 --> 08:58.098
No, you should go and
see that girl in that pub...

08:58.267 --> 09:02.925
...before you start giving me lectures
about having no chance, mate.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.059
Yeah. Yeah, I might.

09:06.062 --> 09:08.391
No disrespect, but you're
never gonna go some pub.

09:08.392 --> 09:11.131
And even if you did, you
wouldn't know what to say.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.346
I mean, I wouldn't
even know what to say.

09:15.184 --> 09:17.174
Alright, love doctor.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.667
Issi's having people round tonight.

09:19.669 --> 09:20.918
Course she is. Again.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.885
Yeah.

09:22.350 --> 09:24.341
- You're going, aren't you?
- Yeah, I might go.

09:24.517 --> 09:26.140
- You're definitely going.
- Yeah, I'll see.

09:26.309 --> 09:28.346
Yeah, which means, "I have to go."

09:31.851 --> 09:33.894
At Exeter, you get five weeks' Easter...

09:33.896 --> 09:35.798
...holiday, so we can
still go to Thailand.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.339
It's like having a gap year.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.906
Oh, my God, we're gonna
have so much fun. That's...

09:41.580 --> 09:43.053
I'm gonna go.

09:43.055 --> 09:47.030
Five of us now,
with Amy, Cesca and Kate.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.017
I hope Andy's going.
He's absolutely gorgeous.

09:55.517 --> 09:58.349
- Who the fuck is Andy?
- I don't know.

09:59.517 --> 10:01.472
Come on, man. Don't go.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.672
I'm not really up to it, to be honest.

10:03.674 --> 10:06.639
What are you gonna do, go home?
Like, it's not even that late.

10:07.517 --> 10:09.580
I think I might go check out that pub.

10:09.582 --> 10:11.642
- What, the one with that girl?
- Yeah.

10:12.809 --> 10:14.081
You're welcome to come.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.348
No, it's alright. I'm not,
I'm not really feeling it.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.929
Just stay, man. Like,
it's never gonna happen, is it?

10:21.892 --> 10:26.264
- Might as well find out.
- Yeah. Yeah, alright, cool.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.965
- Good luck, man.
- Yeah, good luck to you.

10:29.142 --> 10:30.635
Good luck with "gap year."

10:31.809 --> 10:33.640
- Call me later.
- I will do, man. See you.

- So you're a dog?

13:45.059 --> 13:46.159
I'm a dog. Why is that?

13:46.161 --> 13:49.267
Well, if you're unspecified
in a man, you know, like a man,

13:49.434 --> 13:51.754
- you're a dog.
- Okay.

13:52.643 --> 13:56.636
Ev's a cat. Watch out for cats
'cause she's you know can be tricky.

13:56.808 --> 14:00.968
But they always come back.
Speaking of cats! I thought you'd left.

14:01.142 --> 14:02.155

- Hey. How's it going?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.359
Yeah, I work here.

He makes sure the girls
outnumber the boys five to one.

14:13.975 --> 14:16.215
I'm surprised he even let you in.

14:16.392 --> 14:18.715
He came with Ev, so I didn't
really have a choice.

been hearing about your friend.

- Quite the charmer, isn't he?
- Where did you both meet?

14:24.975 --> 14:28.555
- In the street.
- Yeah, I'm working for a charity, so...

14:28.725 --> 14:30.828
I felt sorry for her.
Brought her in from the cold.

14:30.830 --> 14:31.601
What?!

14:31.975 --> 14:34.986
This is mine. I've gotta take this.
Jack, you're a beautiful, man.

16:02.551 --> 16:03.697
Thank you.

16:04.226 --> 16:06.347
You were very late last night.

16:06.518 --> 16:08.840
I was just out with some friends.

16:11.059 --> 16:13.014
How's your job, darling?

16:13.080 --> 16:16.162
Mmm, yeah... it's fine.

16:16.164 --> 16:18.533
Can't wait to get started
at the firm, I expect, eh?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.093
Well, I don't know.
I'm quite enjoying...

16:22.267 --> 16:26.427
It's all very exciting.
My son, the lawyer.

16:28.267 --> 16:32.261
- I think you mean the tea-maker.
- Hmm, don't take that attitude.

16:32.434 --> 16:34.969
Bill Walker doesn't
give out favors often.

16:35.142 --> 16:36.929
What is there to complain about?
I'd have...

16:36.931 --> 16:38.674
...jumped at the opportunity
if I were you.

16:40.184 --> 16:42.933
University's
the bare minimum these days.

16:43.101 --> 16:45.802
It's not easy to get a job
in this climate, you know, Jack.

16:47.017 --> 16:50.519
I-I know and I, you know, I'm,
grateful, I'm grateful to Bill,

16:50.521 --> 16:53.889
but I just, uh... you know.

16:55.017 --> 16:56.640
Well, I don't know.

16:57.267 --> 17:01.213
Maybe... University's not for me.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.303
Ah, you've always had a very dry wit!

17:13.434 --> 17:15.887
- Sure it, how was it?
- Ah, it was cool, actually.

17:16.059 --> 17:18.724
We went to this place
called The Drambuie.

17:18.892 --> 17:21.641
- Met some really nice people.
- Is that a club?

17:23.142 --> 17:25.511
- Sort of, yeah.
- Was it like,

17:25.684 --> 17:29.629
"No way, you're here", or was she like,
"Oh, yeah, you. What's your name again?"

17:29.809 --> 17:33.056
- She remembered my name, yeah.
- That's cool. - Yeah.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.845
The whole thing is kinda wicked.

17:36.017 --> 17:40.677
And, uh, and then from there...
What's up?

17:41.934 --> 17:43.723
It's Issi, man.

17:44.475 --> 17:48.256
Like, after you left the other
night everything was fine.

17:48.433 --> 17:52.509
And we actually got some time
to talk, which was nice, until...

17:52.684 --> 17:55.228
lona, with the help of Freddy,
of course,

17:55.230 --> 17:57.591
starts mixing up this, this rum punch.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.967
And then she starts coming at me,
and basically saying

18:01.142 --> 18:02.584
that I'm a second-class citizen,
because she's going

18:02.587 --> 18:04.391
to Exeter, and I'm going to Bristol,

18:04.558 --> 18:06.932
which is below on The Sunday Timeslist.

18:06.934 --> 18:10.767
She has one drink too many, and
starts being sick everywhere.

18:10.892 --> 18:14.056
- For you, sir?
- Uh, a Crony.

18:14.226 --> 18:17.010
A Crony? Someone's picking up the verse.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.637
- So you score the other night?
- Score?

18:20.809 --> 18:23.049
I fell in love. You had fun?

18:23.226 --> 18:26.307
- Yeah, man, it was wicked.
- What's your plan tonight?

18:26.475 --> 18:28.798
I dunno. Where's Evelyn?

18:28.976 --> 18:31.993
- Why? Do you like her?
- No.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.218
- Oh, shit. You actually do.
- I said no.

18:35.392 --> 18:37.270
Jacky, you listen to Cas.

18:37.272 --> 18:39.932
Don't go near that.
It's too much stress.

18:40.101 --> 18:42.595
Yeah, I mean that's fine.
I don't like her, so...

18:42.597 --> 18:44.842
And, uh, anyway, she's
with Milo, isn't she?

18:45.017 --> 18:47.055
Yeah, she is.

18:51.392 --> 18:54.888
So, what do you like?
What's your thing?

18:56.433 --> 18:58.804
- Evelyn asked me the same question.
- Here we go again!

18:58.976 --> 19:01.262
No, come on, I didn't mean it like that.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.349
- That's not fair.
- I'm fucking with you, Jacky boy.

19:04.517 --> 19:07.244
Tell me, what would you do
if money didn't matter?

19:07.246 --> 19:09.969
If you could do anything,
just for the kick of it.

19:10.142 --> 19:14.846
- I mean, I quite like taking photos.
- There you go. So where's your camera?

19:15.017 --> 19:17.341
- At home.
- Is it film?

19:17.517 --> 19:20.305
- No, it's digital.
- You gotta be shooting on film, baby.

19:20.306 --> 19:21.100
I know.

19:21.101 --> 19:24.631
- You do it all the time?
- I try to. Um...

19:24.809 --> 19:27.301
I mean, my girlfriend
wasn't really sort of...

19:27.406 --> 19:29.820
Don't let chicks get in
the way of what you love.

19:29.892 --> 19:32.345

21:39.986 --> 21:42.206
Uh, well, uh, Taurus, actually.

21:42.207 --> 21:44.638
But you're sort of right
about the girlfriend thing.

21:44.639 --> 21:46.860
- Taurus. Really?
- Yeah, I didn't see that one.

21:46.861 --> 21:49.429
Yeah, anyway, we gotta
go check on our tie-dye.

- Not much.

- So a weird place.
- Why?

22:48.945 --> 22:51.617
Well, I-I just don't get any of it.

22:51.618 --> 22:54.082
What is it that you don't get?

22:54.083 --> 22:56.547
Well, we've only got
seven minutes, so...

22:56.548 --> 22:59.151
Oh, well, you'd better get started.

22:59.152 --> 23:00.785
OK.

- Really?

23:13.597 --> 23:15.853

23:15.854 --> 23:19.707
Um, Cassius works at The Drambuie.

23:19.708 --> 23:22.416
- Uh, the sisters, they just...
- What about Milo?

23:25.541 --> 23:28.423
That question wasn't on the list.

23:29.291 --> 23:32.416
Um, what do you do?

23:33.562 --> 23:37.346
I'm a full-time daughter of darkness.

23:40.332 --> 23:41.930
Right.

23:41.931 --> 23:44.498
But, no, I just think you're different.

23:44.499 --> 23:47.138
We're just kids, man, like you.

23:47.139 --> 23:49.499
Like me? I'm not so sure.

23:51.548 --> 23:55.056
There is something
about you, Jack, isn't there?

24:02.729 --> 24:04.881
Now, which ones?

24:04.882 --> 24:07.693
Um... those ones.

24:07.694 --> 24:09.604
Great shout.

24:11.653 --> 24:12.832
So d'you live here, man?

24:12.833 --> 24:15.818
Yeah, Jacky. This is where it goes down.

24:15.819 --> 24:18.526
Where are Viola and Elena's parents?

24:18.528 --> 24:20.957
They're not really around anymore, Jack.

24:20.958 --> 24:23.735
- Bad car crash, man.
- Oh, shit. I didn't know.

24:23.736 --> 24:25.644
No, no, no, no, they're fine.

24:25.645 --> 24:28.040
I mean, the girls are.

24:28.041 --> 24:31.443
A couple of days ago I hooked up
with this artsy-fartsy baby.

24:31.444 --> 24:32.659
She left her camera here.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.784
It's like a Panto or
a Pentagon or some shit.

24:35.785 --> 24:39.151
She's not coming back for it?

24:39.152 --> 24:42.033
She's never coming back.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.736
You want it?

24:47.451 --> 24:49.707
- This is a Pentax.
- Is that good?

24:49.708 --> 24:52.867
Is it good? It's the best.

24:52.869 --> 24:55.332
Start taking some photos, then.

24:55.333 --> 24:59.707
You know what? I think, for a Pentax,
I can take some photos.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.757
Good.

25:02.694 --> 25:05.436
Thanks, man.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.902
- You wanna be my first photo?
- Let's go.

25:07.903 --> 25:09.535
You ready?

25:20.333 --> 25:22.102
Oh, sister!

25:22.103 --> 25:24.881
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

25:24.882 --> 25:26.964
- How's it going?
- Good.

25:26.966 --> 25:30.402
So, who dumped who?

25:31.166 --> 25:32.415
What?

25:32.416 --> 25:35.506
Who dumped who?
You or your girlfriend?

25:35.507 --> 25:37.728
Yeah, it wasn't really like that.

25:37.729 --> 25:39.603
You know, it was more of a, um...

25:39.604 --> 25:40.888
She dumped you.

25:40.889 --> 25:43.144
Yeah, dumped you real good.

25:43.145 --> 25:46.096
No, no, I promise.
It wasn't. It was, it was fine.

25:46.097 --> 25:48.770
I love a good dumping.

25:48.771 --> 25:52.346
It's like one of those ones
from out of nowhere. It's like...

25:52.347 --> 25:55.193
But I... I love you.

25:55.194 --> 25:56.964
I need you.

25:56.965 --> 25:59.534
I am nothing without you.

25:59.535 --> 26:02.102
It's good, though.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.534
You know, you've got emotions, Jacky.

26:04.535 --> 26:08.040
- I can call you Jacky, right?
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.367
I mean, that's more than
can be said about some.

26:10.368 --> 26:13.631
True. Not mentioning
any names or anything.

26:13.632 --> 26:14.777
Milo.

26:14.778 --> 26:17.381
- Who?
- Milo.

26:17.382 --> 26:19.394
Where do you think
she'll say he is tonight?

26:19.395 --> 26:21.790
I'm going for "fuck knows."

26:21.791 --> 26:26.026
Obviously.
"Fuck knows" sounds right.

26:26.027 --> 26:28.284
Not eaten you alive yet,
have they, Jacky?

26:28.285 --> 26:29.881
He calls him Jacky, too!

26:29.882 --> 26:32.415
Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm hanging in there.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.943
Elena's got a girl for you.

26:33.944 --> 26:35.680
I don't need hook-ups.
Come on, Jack.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.735
It's for us. You got your
boogie shoes on, baby?

26:38.736 --> 26:40.610

29:02.139 --> 29:03.110
Oh.

29:03.111 --> 29:05.610
What are you doing today?

29:05.611 --> 29:09.151
Oh, um...

29:09.152 --> 29:12.624
I dunno. I probably
should be getting home.

29:12.625 --> 29:16.548
Oh, not on an empty stomach.
What would your mother say?

29:16.549 --> 29:19.500
Come on.

29:22.590 --> 29:24.708
Hmm. You don't wanna know.

29:30.264 --> 29:32.659
You've known the sisters for a while?

29:32.660 --> 29:34.464
Yeah. A year, I suppose.

29:34.465 --> 29:36.548
I just moved in, like,
a year ago or something.

29:36.549 --> 29:39.290
Oh, nice. And they're so sweet.
They love you.

29:39.291 --> 29:42.762
Hmm, they love you.

29:42.764 --> 29:43.804
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:43.805 --> 29:45.576
Although I'm totally blaming them

29:45.577 --> 29:48.701
for how I feel this morning.
I just feel so bad.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.659
Sorry I'm late, baby.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.123
- Counted on it.
- Well, that's sweet.

29:55.124 --> 29:57.312
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

29:57.937 --> 30:00.472
I'm good.

30:00.473 --> 30:03.144
- Where have you been?
- Just busy.

30:03.145 --> 30:06.548
Um, excuse me.
Can I get a coffee, please?

30:06.549 --> 30:08.353
Yeah, coming right up.
Anything to eat?

30:08.354 --> 30:09.603
No, I'm good, thank you.

30:09.604 --> 30:13.005
- You should eat.
- I'm not hungry.

30:13.007 --> 30:15.852
I sorta never eat breakfast.

30:15.853 --> 30:17.589
Most important meal of the day.

30:17.590 --> 30:20.540
Well, that depends when you
start your day, though, right?

30:20.541 --> 30:23.527
True. Normally in the morning,
but not today, apparently.

30:23.528 --> 30:26.478
- There you go, love.
- Thank you so much.

30:26.479 --> 30:27.660
Enjoy.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.624
What do you do, Jack?

30:32.625 --> 30:36.374
Mmm... sorry, mouth full. Um...

30:36.375 --> 30:38.839
I'm going to Bristol uni next year.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.956
He's working for the London Heart Trust.

30:40.958 --> 30:43.284
You're a chugger? That's beautiful.

30:43.285 --> 30:45.888
He's a real-life Robin Hood.

30:45.889 --> 30:47.867
Yeah, without the bow and arrow.

30:47.868 --> 30:49.326
Is that yours?

30:49.327 --> 30:51.929
Um, yeah. Well, uh,
it's Cassius's actually.

30:51.930 --> 30:55.852
Or his friend's, but, um,
he gave it to me, which is...

30:55.853 --> 30:58.075
- Really? That's sweet of him.
- Yeah.

30:58.076 --> 31:03.006
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Try and take some photos.

31:03.007 --> 31:05.540
Other than Cassius in his underwear...

31:07.035 --> 31:09.257
Some proper photos, you know.

31:11.097 --> 31:12.555
How was the party?

31:12.556 --> 31:17.172
It was fun. Jack is my new best friend.

31:17.173 --> 31:19.672
Watch out, man. She's flaky.

31:19.673 --> 31:24.256
I'm flaky?
You're the flakiest person I know.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.061
Jack is a little reliable rock.

31:26.062 --> 31:28.457
- There's a compliment for you.
- Right.

31:28.458 --> 31:32.138
Yeah, no, I love being compared
to inanimate objects. That's...

31:32.139 --> 31:35.056
I'm going for a smoke.

31:43.528 --> 31:45.957
She really lives in her own world.

31:47.832 --> 31:50.019
I wish I could be
more like her sometimes.

31:50.020 --> 31:54.638
- Like all of 'em.
- Yeah? All that's pricey.

31:54.639 --> 31:56.165
What does that mean?

31:56.166 --> 31:59.117
They're a bit lost. Going
round and round in circles.

31:59.118 --> 32:02.555
You just keep your head, you know.

32:02.556 --> 32:05.403
Yeah. Thanks.

32:06.861 --> 32:08.493
What about her?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.263
Well, if she ever lived in it,

32:10.264 --> 32:14.256
she'd be the most beautiful
thing the real world ever saw,

32:14.257 --> 32:15.609
but...

32:15.610 --> 32:17.623
Yeah, she's hard to work out, I guess.

32:17.624 --> 32:19.535
I wouldn't even try.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.804
Hang out with me one of these days.

32:23.805 --> 32:25.818
We can try and work you out.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.590
- Are you done?
- Yeah, sure, man.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.936
Can we go? If it's not too dull.

32:32.937 --> 32:34.882
Not too dull at all.

32:38.979 --> 32:40.889
See you later, Jack.

33:24.534 --> 33:26.930
Is this how you imagined your life, Mum?

33:26.931 --> 33:28.701
What do you mean, love?

33:30.369 --> 33:33.040
When you were younger.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.749
Is this how you thought
things would pan out?

33:38.041 --> 33:40.402
I mean, was this the dream?

33:40.403 --> 33:42.902
No, of course not.

33:44.882 --> 33:46.581
Then why?

33:46.582 --> 33:48.735
Because that's just how it works.

33:48.736 --> 33:52.348
You know, you...
Life doesn't always...

33:53.770 --> 33:57.034
...play out the way
you think it's going to.

33:57.035 --> 34:01.271
In a funny way that's what
makes life more interesting.

34:04.153 --> 34:05.922
You don't really think that, do you?

34:05.923 --> 34:08.319
Yes. Yes, I do.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.097
That's... that's how it works.

34:16.618 --> 34:20.018
- I was going to be a painter.
- I know.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.735
And Nancy was going
to be a fashion designer.

34:23.735 --> 34:26.686
And together we were
going to, you know...

34:26.687 --> 34:29.081
- Take over the world.
- Exactly, darling.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.068
Hmm.

34:32.069 --> 34:34.639
And then I fell in love with your dad.

36:29.639 --> 36:33.456
Cassius asked me the question
the other day, and I didn't...

36:33.457 --> 36:34.742
I didn't have an answer.

36:34.743 --> 36:36.825
I get that.

36:36.827 --> 36:38.492
I think that life is too short

36:38.493 --> 36:43.352
to... to do something
that you don't like, but it...

36:43.353 --> 36:48.665
I don't know, it takes a lot
of courage and bravery to...

36:48.666 --> 36:51.270
...to really have trust in yourself,

36:51.271 --> 36:54.359
and do what you wanna do and...

36:54.360 --> 36:58.422
I... you know, I didn't
wanna end up like my parents,

36:58.423 --> 37:02.832
and spend the rest of my days
doing a job that I don't like,

37:02.833 --> 37:08.736
and not having the time
to see my children and, um...

37:12.000 --> 37:14.986
It's... it's not always easy.

37:16.444 --> 37:17.936
Yeah.

37:17.937 --> 37:20.297
Don't you worry?

37:20.298 --> 37:23.352
Yeah, I worry a lot.

37:23.353 --> 37:26.202
Being around you guys
makes me worry less, though.

37:27.381 --> 37:29.014
And you shouldn't worry.

37:29.882 --> 37:32.380
If, uh...

37:32.381 --> 37:36.097
If anyone deserves happiness
more than you, I wanna meet 'em.

37:36.098 --> 37:39.256
That's sweet.

38:02.486 --> 38:05.089
Well played, man.
Good job. Played, Aaron.

38:05.090 --> 38:07.936
See you, Michael.
See you later, Josh, mate.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.298
Played, Josh. Take care, man.

38:12.312 --> 38:15.992
- Well played, dude.
- Yeah, man, you did brilliant.

38:15.993 --> 38:19.290
- There's little Reid.
- Alright, Reid?

38:19.291 --> 38:20.958
Alright, Jack?

38:22.035 --> 38:24.951
Why weren't you at work yesterday, man?

38:24.952 --> 38:27.380
Oh, yeah, man. I was, uh...

38:27.381 --> 38:29.672
I've decided to stop working.

38:29.673 --> 38:31.999
What? How are you
gonna pay for South America?

38:32.000 --> 38:35.957
Yeah, that's what I... what
I wanted to talk to you about.

38:35.958 --> 38:39.672
I'm not sure I necessarily
wanna go anymore.

38:39.673 --> 38:43.388
- What?
- Yeah. I just...

38:43.389 --> 38:44.811
We've both worked really hard,

38:44.812 --> 38:46.964
and we've saved up money,
a lot of money...

38:46.965 --> 38:48.526
Yeah.

38:48.527 --> 38:51.582
And I'm not exactly sure
it's what I wanna do with it.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.248
What's gonna be better

38:53.249 --> 38:55.784
than going with your best mate
to South America for six months?

38:55.785 --> 39:00.888
Like, it was an amazing plan,
and I wanted it too, but...

39:00.889 --> 39:03.214
But it's this new girl, right?

39:03.215 --> 39:06.027
It's got nothing to do with
the new girl, man. I'm not with her.

39:06.028 --> 39:08.318
But I've had time to think and,
you know, I...

39:08.319 --> 39:11.547
No, I don't know.
I don't know at all.

39:11.548 --> 39:14.325
You might have a better time
if you go with someone else.

39:14.326 --> 39:16.547
What are you on about?
You're my best mate!

39:16.548 --> 39:19.846
We've been best mates since,
like, I can remember.

39:19.848 --> 39:21.200
And now you're...

39:21.201 --> 39:23.492
As your best mate,
I'm saying it's not what I want.

39:23.493 --> 39:25.124
Whether that's shit of me, or not,

39:25.125 --> 39:27.380
I'm not gonna waste
that period of my life.

39:27.381 --> 39:31.652
Next thing you'll say you're
not going to Bristol anymore.

39:31.653 --> 39:34.013
I haven't made any decisions
about Bristol.

39:34.014 --> 39:36.964
- You out of your fucking mind?
- What?

39:36.965 --> 39:39.881
- What did your mum and dad say?
- I haven't told them yet.

39:39.882 --> 39:42.519
- What, so it's not definite?
- What do you mean?

39:42.520 --> 39:44.672
You can't just change your plans, mate.

39:44.673 --> 39:47.311
I can change my plans, Tom!
I'm an adult!

39:47.312 --> 39:49.048
What do you... what do you mean?

39:49.049 --> 39:52.034
Like, if I don't wanna go to uni,
I don't have to go to uni.

39:52.035 --> 39:54.707
I'm not gonna go traveling with you.
Deal with that.

39:54.708 --> 39:57.519
Whatever. I'm going to work.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.618

Yes, Jack.
Have you got a problem with it?

42:31.827 --> 42:34.464
Well, yeah.
I mean, it seems pretty fucked.

42:34.465 --> 42:36.410

No, but I mean how...

44:49.708 --> 44:53.353
You're probably the best person to ask.

44:53.354 --> 44:55.367
I'm not sure I am.

44:55.368 --> 44:58.318
Well, he likes you,
and I like that, but...

44:58.319 --> 45:02.452
Well... everybody likes you.

45:06.826 --> 45:08.665
You like playing this little game?

45:08.666 --> 45:10.402
Are we playing a game?

45:10.403 --> 45:13.353
Ooh, I think you might be.

45:13.354 --> 45:16.235
Well, if we were playing a game,

45:16.236 --> 45:18.736
I don't think I would play it with you.

45:22.035 --> 45:23.943
That's a shame.

45:40.333 --> 45:41.478
Whoo!

45:41.479 --> 45:43.424
Yeah! Wow!

46:39.916 --> 46:41.305
Let's take a cab.

46:41.306 --> 46:42.831
Let's walk.

46:42.832 --> 46:46.998
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Let's walk.

46:46.999 --> 46:50.611
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. You want to?

46:52.103 --> 46:55.123
OK. Take us all night, but...

46:55.124 --> 46:57.798
That's fine. I've got all night.

47:06.583 --> 47:10.263
How did you end up
living with El and Vi?

47:10.264 --> 47:13.561
I don't know if I can tell you.
You're gonna laugh.

47:13.562 --> 47:16.339
I'm not gonna laugh. Tell me.

47:16.340 --> 47:19.290
On a school trip. French exchange.

47:20.749 --> 47:23.040
OK. That is quite funny.

47:23.041 --> 47:26.269
That's perfect.

47:26.270 --> 47:30.922
And so, what, you just kinda...
stayed and never left?

47:30.923 --> 47:35.228
Well I-I had to go back to Paris
to finish high school.

47:35.229 --> 47:38.527
And, um, when the accident happened,

47:38.528 --> 47:41.513
I came back and I stayed.

47:41.514 --> 47:43.944
Oh, that's nice.

47:46.062 --> 47:48.769
What about your parents?
I mean, do they...?

47:48.770 --> 47:50.714
They must miss you, like...

47:50.715 --> 47:55.194
Yeah, well, you know, they're busy,
and I'm busy too, so...

47:55.749 --> 47:57.936
Right.

47:57.937 --> 48:00.748
Do they come visit or...?

48:00.749 --> 48:02.172
Not really.

48:02.173 --> 48:05.783
They call me, every Monday at 9:30.

48:05.784 --> 48:07.451
Oh, like a set time. Wow.

48:07.452 --> 48:08.909
It's very stupid.

48:08.910 --> 48:11.165
It's strict.

48:11.166 --> 48:14.742
Actually,
they still think I'm in college.

48:14.743 --> 48:16.131
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:16.132 --> 48:17.589
For art?

48:17.591 --> 48:21.269
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I tried that, but, I don't know,

48:21.270 --> 48:26.582
I'm not really good with
this color structure, I guess.

48:26.583 --> 48:29.950
OK. Well, that's alright, you know.

48:29.951 --> 48:31.964
I mean, there are
a ton of famous artists

48:31.965 --> 48:36.166
- that never trained.
- Yeah, right.

48:38.494 --> 48:40.436
So, can I see some of this art?

48:40.437 --> 48:42.485
I don't know.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.742
I don't, I don't really
like to show my art.

48:44.743 --> 48:49.326
Such an artist thing to say.
That right there.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.929
Well, maybe I'll show you one day.

48:51.931 --> 48:54.395
Yeah? OK.

48:54.396 --> 48:56.652
I look forward to that.

49:13.285 --> 49:15.473
Interesting.

49:16.132 --> 49:17.868
Cas?

49:24.882 --> 49:27.208
My two favorite people.

49:29.951 --> 49:32.832
Want a beer?

49:32.833 --> 49:34.117
Yeah, thanks, man.

49:34.118 --> 49:35.922
Thought you were Cassius.

49:35.923 --> 49:38.040
You guys have fun tonight?

49:38.041 --> 49:39.431
Loads.

49:40.125 --> 49:41.930
Jacky?

49:41.931 --> 49:44.638
Yeah, man.

49:44.639 --> 49:46.617
Yeah. Why did you leave?

49:46.618 --> 49:49.221
Don't worry, baby.
I'm just glad you had fun.

49:49.223 --> 49:51.581
And you, Jack.

49:55.853 --> 49:57.763
Saved by the bell.

49:57.764 --> 50:00.264
- Are you OK?
- No, not really.

50:01.826 --> 50:03.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:03.701 --> 50:06.895
- You're being a bore again.
- Oh, the biggest.

50:11.548 --> 50:13.077
Let's go to bed.

50:15.819 --> 50:18.041
You really are a beautiful man.

50:24.603 --> 50:26.166
You really are.

50:29.431 --> 50:31.339
Jacky, he'll get over it.

50:31.340 --> 50:32.901
How do you know?

50:32.902 --> 50:34.811
He cares more about his car than her.

50:34.812 --> 50:36.548
Milk?

50:43.354 --> 50:45.056
Tea?

50:45.958 --> 50:48.006
Peanut butter?

50:48.007 --> 50:50.264
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

50:53.285 --> 50:54.360
Bed?

50:54.361 --> 50:56.617
Yeah, come on.

50:56.618 --> 50:59.360
Anyway, Jack, you know we love you.

50:59.361 --> 51:01.028
- Sleep well.
- Thanks.

51:40.402 --> 51:42.382
Wake up, mate.

51:43.423 --> 51:45.263
Jack.

51:45.264 --> 51:47.485
Wake up.
I've got you a cup of tea, yeah.

51:49.499 --> 51:51.374
Hey, man.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.769
- Big night, was it?
- Yeah.

51:53.770 --> 51:57.381
- Been a while.
- Yeah.

51:58.910 --> 52:01.027
What's up, man?

52:01.028 --> 52:02.484
What's up with you?

52:02.485 --> 52:05.436
Uh, I've felt better.

52:07.764 --> 52:11.791
- Haven't seen you in ages.
- Yeah. You're good, though?

52:14.257 --> 52:16.895
Why haven't you introduced me
to your new mates?

52:17.903 --> 52:19.498
They're not my new mates.

52:19.499 --> 52:22.207
Whatever the fuck they are.
Why haven't you introduced me?

52:22.208 --> 52:25.644
Are you embarrassed by me?
They cooler than me or what?

52:25.645 --> 52:27.589
Am I emb...?

52:27.590 --> 52:30.228
Why are you in my room, Tom?

52:30.229 --> 52:32.589
I don't know, actually.
I'm just... I'm gonna go.

52:32.590 --> 52:35.055
I'll just...
I'll see you whenever. It's fine.

52:35.056 --> 52:36.756
OK. Walk away, and be a child about it.

52:36.757 --> 52:38.839
Are you joking me?
Are you kidding?

52:38.840 --> 52:40.853
I was gonna say the same
thing to you, mate.

52:40.854 --> 52:42.971
It's three o'clock in the afternoon.

52:42.972 --> 52:44.915
Sort your shit out!
Look at this place!

52:44.916 --> 52:47.867
I don't care what time it is!
And why do you?

52:47.868 --> 52:49.464
What does that matter to you?

52:49.465 --> 52:52.415
Why are you in my room?
Asking me all these questions?

52:52.416 --> 52:54.429
Is this 'cause I won't
go traveling with you?

52:54.430 --> 52:56.235
- No.
- So what is it about, Tom?

52:56.236 --> 52:59.048
It's about you turning
into a fucking arsehole, mate!

52:59.049 --> 53:00.401
How am I an arsehole?

53:00.402 --> 53:02.623
How would you know?
I haven't seen you!

53:02.624 --> 53:05.194
I haven't been with you,
and you can't deal with that.

53:05.195 --> 53:07.035
Fuck off!

53:08.806 --> 53:12.867
- Oh.. good, great, nice.
- Jack.

53:12.868 --> 53:15.228
Sorry, mate, you've gotta understand...

53:15.229 --> 53:20.194
Jack... Jack, can we please have a chat?

53:20.195 --> 53:22.902
You and them both, huh?
This is great. Everyone's having a go.

53:22.903 --> 53:25.610
I didn't mean to push you.
I just lost it for a second.

53:25.611 --> 53:28.839
You know what?
It's good. I needed it.

53:28.840 --> 53:34.049
Any idea how much money you've
spent over the last few weeks?

53:35.506 --> 53:37.450
Are you actually joking me right now?

53:37.451 --> 53:39.429
Your internship starts tomorrow.

53:39.430 --> 53:43.110
Oh, you're right!
I'm so sorry! I totally forgot!

53:43.111 --> 53:45.055
I should be downstairs ironing my tie!

53:45.056 --> 53:47.276
How do you think
Bill Walker likes his coffee?

53:47.277 --> 53:50.505
You have no idea how lucky
you are to be working for Bill!

53:50.506 --> 53:52.833
Bill Walker can fuck off!

53:54.430 --> 53:56.444
Excuse me.

53:58.319 --> 53:59.882
Jack.

54:52.903 --> 54:56.408
- Oh, you missed him.
- He was quite far away.

54:56.410 --> 54:58.596
Yeah, you should have just hit his car.

54:58.597 --> 55:00.297
Smashed window would've been nice.

55:00.298 --> 55:01.790
Or right on his head.

55:01.791 --> 55:04.707
- Dans la tête?
- Ah, oui, c'est ça.

55:06.270 --> 55:08.076
Hey.

55:08.077 --> 55:10.680
What's with the backpack,
Huckleberry Finn?

55:10.681 --> 55:13.076
Oh, I've run away.

55:13.077 --> 55:14.672
First time?

55:14.673 --> 55:17.381
Yeah. Yeah, it's my first time.

55:18.389 --> 55:20.193
Livin' the dream, brah.

55:20.194 --> 55:23.596
Actually, I was gonna ask you
guys whether I could stay here.

55:23.597 --> 55:25.748
- Yeah, sure.
- You can have my room.

55:25.749 --> 55:28.456
- Wait, where are you staying?
- I got a date.

55:28.458 --> 55:29.881
Like a sleepover date?

55:29.882 --> 55:31.200
Not officially, but...

55:31.201 --> 55:32.589
You are such a sleaze.

55:32.590 --> 55:34.602
You're like an advert for chlamydia.

55:34.604 --> 55:36.514
It's way too early for this.

55:38.597 --> 55:40.125
Shall we do something?

55:42.207 --> 55:44.185
Uh, us?

55:44.186 --> 55:46.894
Yeah.

55:46.895 --> 55:48.701
Why don't you guys go up to the country?

55:48.702 --> 55:52.347
Yeah, we've got a place.
We haven't been there in ages.

55:59.119 --> 56:00.540
Do you want to?

56:00.541 --> 56:02.623
Yeah, I mean... I want...
Do you want to?

56:02.624 --> 56:05.541
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, yeah, OK.

56:07.035 --> 56:09.430
- What's...?
- Drive safe.

56:11.653 --> 56:13.735
I'm just gonna pack,
and I... I come back.

56:13.736 --> 56:15.091
I'll, I'll wait here.

56:30.332 --> 56:32.623
Oh, my God.

56:32.624 --> 56:34.360
Ta-da!

56:36.791 --> 56:38.839
I'm sure it's not that hard.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.826
Yeah.

56:41.827 --> 56:44.569
I can drive. I just...

56:45.402 --> 56:46.721
...don't have a license.

56:46.722 --> 56:49.985
That's fine, then.
I believe in you, baby.

56:49.986 --> 56:51.583
Wait, wait.

56:54.812 --> 56:56.791
- Miss.
- Thank you.

56:59.743 --> 57:01.374
Fucking hell.

57:04.812 --> 57:07.276
This is an awful idea.

57:07.277 --> 57:11.410
- I mean, like, really bad.
- Do it for me.

57:14.291 --> 57:16.618

Thanks.

59:26.444 --> 59:28.215
Bedtime.

59:49.812 --> 59:53.005
Which one do you want?

59:53.006 --> 59:56.929
I don't mind. Which one do you want?

59:56.930 --> 01:00:01.722
Well, that bed is better.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:05.228
You could always be a gentleman
and give me that one.

01:00:06.306 --> 01:00:09.013
Not sure about being a gentleman.

01:00:09.014 --> 01:00:13.770
- We could toss a coin for it.
- Fuck you!

01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:17.033
OK, well, Rock, paper, scissors then?

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:18.702
Right.

01:00:20.055 --> 01:00:22.763
Go on, count it in, pussy.

01:00:22.764 --> 01:00:24.326
One, two, three.

01:00:25.507 --> 01:00:28.076
What is it that you call me again?

01:00:28.806 --> 01:00:30.992
One, two, three.

01:00:30.993 --> 01:00:33.318
Pussy. I called you a pussy.

01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:35.123
OK, well. Big time.

01:00:35.124 --> 01:00:39.257
- Oh, massive! Huge moment.
- One, two, three.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.519
Oh, fuck.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.915
Paper beats rock.

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:48.874
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:52.451
You know, in France,

01:00:52.452 --> 01:00:55.645
I don't think that paper
really beats rock.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:58.943
In France, yeah. That's good
because we're in England now.

01:00:58.944 --> 01:01:01.513
In England, the rules are
that paper does beat rock.

01:01:01.514 --> 01:01:03.214
- Oh, yeah.
- So French rock,

01:01:03.215 --> 01:01:07.035
unless we're in France
that wouldn't work.

01:01:08.702 --> 01:01:10.507
Go run the bath for me.

01:03:41.895 --> 01:03:43.424
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

01:03:46.027 --> 01:03:48.214
It's so early.

01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:50.124
It's beautiful.

01:03:50.819 --> 01:03:52.416
Yeah.

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:54.811
Do you know you snore?

01:03:54.812 --> 01:03:58.215
Sorry about that.

01:04:01.722 --> 01:04:03.977
Last night was really fun.

01:04:03.978 --> 01:04:06.132
You're always fun, Jack.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.437
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:04:12.243 --> 01:04:14.673
- Jack.
- Yeah?

01:04:15.923 --> 01:04:17.556
Stop.

01:04:23.007 --> 01:04:24.743
OK.

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:32.727
Um, I'm gonna go and make a cup of tea.

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:34.500
Yeah.

01:05:18.354 --> 01:05:20.124
How do you feel?

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:22.348
What?

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:25.679
How are you feeling?

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.416
About what?

01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:30.785
About us, Ev.

01:05:33.077 --> 01:05:35.123
Don't start that game, man.

01:05:35.124 --> 01:05:37.693
I'm not... Don't call me "man."

01:05:37.694 --> 01:05:38.769
Man, man, man.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:40.888
What is wrong with you?

01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:44.117
Nothing. What's wrong with you?

01:05:44.118 --> 01:05:45.644
Oh, good.

01:05:45.645 --> 01:05:47.867
We're back doing this now
where you don't tell me anything.

01:05:47.868 --> 01:05:49.464
- Hey!
- What?

01:05:49.465 --> 01:05:52.208
Just look at me.
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.506
I'm not playing a game.

01:05:55.507 --> 01:05:58.249
- We're all playing games.
- No.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.811
No, you and Milo might play games.

01:05:59.812 --> 01:06:04.221
- I'm not playing a game.
- Don't work yourself up, Jacky.

01:06:04.223 --> 01:06:05.436
I'm not getting...

01:06:05.437 --> 01:06:07.763
What does that mean,
"Don't work yourself up"?

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:10.818
You all play games.
It's all a joke to you.

01:06:10.819 --> 01:06:13.873
Am I a joke to you, Ev?

01:06:13.874 --> 01:06:16.686
You play games with Milo.
Milo definitely plays games with you.

01:06:16.687 --> 01:06:19.533
Always messing you around.
And now you're playing games with me.

01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:21.027
He's not playing games with me.

01:06:21.028 --> 01:06:25.123
Oh, Milo doesn't play games
with you! Really?

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:28.526
What d'you think he's doing
every time he's not with you?

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:30.575
What?

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:33.284
- His work.
- Yeah.

01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:36.097
- It's sick.
- How exciting.

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:41.202
You have no idea what he does?

01:06:44.882 --> 01:06:47.867
OK, well, let me fill you in.

01:06:47.868 --> 01:06:51.444
You're better than him, and
what he does and how he is.

01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:55.368
And you and me,
we can get away from all this.

01:06:55.369 --> 01:06:57.971
- Do you never ask questions?
- Do you ever stop?

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.089
Do you wonder
what your boyfriend is doing

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.721
when he's not with you?

01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:05.263
- If he loved you...
- What are you talking about?

01:07:05.264 --> 01:07:08.388
Who are you to tell me
what to think about my boyfriend?

01:07:08.389 --> 01:07:10.194
You don't know anything.

01:07:14.223 --> 01:07:15.644
You don't make any sense.

01:07:15.645 --> 01:07:17.901
Well, that's the best compliment
anyone ever paid me.

01:07:17.902 --> 01:07:20.193
I'm trying to help you, Ev.

01:07:20.194 --> 01:07:23.423
You never ever had to do that.

01:07:23.424 --> 01:07:26.931
It's not about what I had to do.
It's about what I want to do Evelyn, OK.

01:07:29.777 --> 01:07:31.409
I get it.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:35.818
You liked me, you wanted me,
and now, now you've fucked me.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.451
You happy?

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:43.007
And did me fucking you mean anything?

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:47.382
Yeah, it meant lots.

01:07:51.757 --> 01:07:54.047
So where does that leave me?

01:07:54.048 --> 01:07:58.840
Where it leaves me.
Part of your history.

01:08:06.478 --> 01:08:10.299
I don't want you to be my
history. I want us to be real.

01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:13.423
Jack, we...

01:08:15.472 --> 01:08:17.590
We barely know each other.

01:08:18.631 --> 01:08:20.957
Don't...

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:24.118
Don't try to make that
what it can't be right now, and...

01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:32.589
Just try to enjoy it as it is.

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:34.569
As it can be.

01:08:36.202 --> 01:08:37.868
A spark.

01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:46.131
- Jack...
- Not now.

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.444
We thought you'd run off.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:01.270
Hey. I didn't realize
you guys were coming down.

01:10:01.271 --> 01:10:05.228
I didn't have a birthday party,
so I thought it'd be fun.

01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:07.451
- The others are downstairs.
- Sure.

01:10:10.681 --> 01:10:13.631
- Oh, hey, Jack.
- Jack!

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:15.888
I can't believe they let you
drive the Rolls.

01:10:15.889 --> 01:10:18.456
- Why can't I drive the Rolls?
- Cause you don't have a license.

01:10:18.457 --> 01:10:20.610
- Whatever.
- Still I think it's unfair.

01:10:20.611 --> 01:10:23.943
You and Jack go sort out the barbecue.

01:10:23.944 --> 01:10:25.576
Let's get out of here.

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:35.367
So there must be quite a lot of
people coming to Vi's birthday?

01:10:35.368 --> 01:10:38.527
Any minute now, baby.
Any minute now.

01:10:40.298 --> 01:10:44.152
- How was last night?
- Yeah, it was fine, man.

01:10:44.153 --> 01:10:48.145
- What went down?
- Nothing. We just went to bed.

01:10:48.146 --> 01:10:50.194
Something happened, surely?

01:10:50.195 --> 01:10:52.902
Jesus, why the interrogation, Cas?

01:10:52.903 --> 01:10:54.117
You fuck her?

01:10:54.119 --> 01:10:59.082
- Shut up.
- No. No?!

01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:02.623
- No. No.
- Cas, shut up.

01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:05.541
What the fuck were you thinking, Jack?

01:11:07.208 --> 01:11:09.186
You better keep that
to yourself, my man.

01:11:09.187 --> 01:11:12.380
Yeah, of course.

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.568
Good. Good.

01:11:15.993 --> 01:11:20.957
- Fuck! What was it like?
- Shut up, man.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:25.089
Please God, tell me Dave
didn't drive you all down?

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:27.589
Do you all have a death wish?

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:30.298

It's my dad, man.
I just don't think we see eye-to-eye.

01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:14.221
What about your parents?

01:13:14.222 --> 01:13:18.214
Parents are tricky, man.
They are tricky.

01:13:18.215 --> 01:13:22.102
Hey, guys. D'you wanna play
fire hockey later?

01:13:22.103 --> 01:13:25.193
- Uh, what's that?
- Oh, it's the best, man.

01:13:25.194 --> 01:13:27.729
Come on, Jack. Don't be a bore.

01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:30.263
Come on, Jacky.

01:13:30.264 --> 01:13:33.109
Um, yeah, I might sit
this one out, you guys.

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:34.812
Who's being a bore?

01:13:37.035 --> 01:13:42.034
Come on, Jacky. Play the game.
What's wrong?

01:13:42.035 --> 01:13:45.576
Nothing, man.
Yeah, um, let's play.

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:49.673
- Let's play.
- Cool.

01:13:52.277 --> 01:13:53.457
You go there.

01:14:04.743 --> 01:14:06.547
Whoo!

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:15.750
Over here!

01:14:58.597 --> 01:15:00.090
It'll be OK.

01:15:02.034 --> 01:15:04.604
Come on. Let's get you a drink.

01:15:16.861 --> 01:15:20.784
Want one?

01:15:20.785 --> 01:15:24.081
Or are you one of those
"I don't like salt and vinegar" losers?

01:15:24.082 --> 01:15:28.561
Uh, thanks.

01:15:28.562 --> 01:15:31.861
See, I knew you were
part of our team, Jacky.

01:15:35.228 --> 01:15:36.931
I know what you're thinking.

01:15:42.694 --> 01:15:44.673
You want cheese and onion, don't you?

01:15:50.785 --> 01:15:52.242
Do we have any cheese and onion?

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:54.638
No, only salt and vinegar.

01:15:54.639 --> 01:15:57.033
Jacky wants cheese and onion.

01:15:57.034 --> 01:16:00.298
I'm fine, really.

01:16:04.639 --> 01:16:06.687
Let's go and put Dave to bed.

01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:15.611
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

01:16:21.757 --> 01:16:25.403
- Milo and I are...
- Listen, you don't have to...

01:16:27.277 --> 01:16:29.984
You don't have to explain. It's...

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:32.694
It's fine, really.
Thank you, though.

01:16:34.152 --> 01:16:35.750
I understand.

01:16:44.812 --> 01:16:48.248
What about the boy you were
with the first time I met you?

01:16:51.827 --> 01:16:53.631
Tom?

01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:55.923
Yeah. How is he?

01:16:57.452 --> 01:16:59.082
Um...

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.415
Tom, how's... how's Tom?

01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:04.014
Um...

01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:07.798
I don't really know.

01:17:07.799 --> 01:17:11.582
To be honest, I haven't
spoken to him in a while, so...

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.944
Well, maybe you should call him, then.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:18.874
Yeah, I don't know, uh...

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.519
How much he's gonna wanna hear from me.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.055
I haven't been that good to him,
but, uh...

01:17:27.035 --> 01:17:29.326
Yeah, no, I will. Thanks.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:32.416
I'll do that.

01:17:42.069 --> 01:17:43.909
Why, um...?

01:17:47.868 --> 01:17:50.298
Why... Why did last night happen?

01:17:52.277 --> 01:17:56.097
Because I wanted to.

01:17:57.486 --> 01:18:00.611
I'm sorry, I just don't have
any other explanations.

01:18:03.874 --> 01:18:05.819
Yeah, no, that's...

01:18:07.243 --> 01:18:09.187
That's OK. That's, that's fine.

01:18:15.681 --> 01:18:16.964
But you'll be alright.

01:18:16.965 --> 01:18:20.227
Yeah, you reckon?

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.867
You're gonna be a great photographer.

01:18:25.403 --> 01:18:28.422
It's really me you should worry about.

01:18:28.424 --> 01:18:30.680
Oh, yeah? How's that?

01:18:30.681 --> 01:18:33.665
Well, I'm just a lost girl from Paris.

01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:42.381
What about, uh,
what about your painting?

01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:44.915
Well, I don't show my art, so...

01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:47.520
Oh, right. I forgot.

01:18:50.819 --> 01:18:52.937
Well, that's up to you, you know.

01:20:42.173 --> 01:20:44.534
Hey, Tommy, it's me.
How are you doing, man?

01:20:44.535 --> 01:20:46.790
Um, listen, it was so good
to see you last night,

01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:49.950
and I just wanna say again
good luck on your trip.

01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:51.339
That smug look on your face

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.318
while you're overlooking
the beautiful vistas

01:20:53.319 --> 01:20:55.540
with Gisele on your arm
will be priceless.

01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:58.561
And, listen, if you need to get
bailed out a Colombian prison,

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.123
just give me a call.

01:21:00.124 --> 01:21:01.894
Anyway, have a safe flight, my man,

01:21:01.895 --> 01:21:03.839
and can't wait to hear all your stories.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.424
Lots of love. Speak soon. Bye.
