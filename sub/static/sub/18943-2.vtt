00:01.480 --> 00:04.959
(Kurt) Top five female singers
in order of shaggability.

00:04.959 --> 00:08.159
(Brian) Current or in their prime?
(Kurt) In their prime.

00:08.159 --> 00:10.839
- Debbie Harry.
- (Simon) Madonna.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.358
Celine.

00:12.359 --> 00:16.120
It's like trying to work out
the top five shaggable men... ever.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.919
- It's impossible.
- You choose a category then.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.400
What about the top five
members of staff?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.799
Modesty prevents me from entering.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.958
I said top five, not top 55.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.109
- Top of the tree's Penny.
- What a surprise.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.400
She's not emotionally unstable enough
for you, Kurt.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.718
- (All laugh)
- Oh, fuck off.

00:34.719 --> 00:37.719
Here, check out his mobile.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.120
Yeah.

00:43.319 --> 00:46.159
- 12 text messages.
- 43 the other evening.

00:46.159 --> 00:49.159
"Why?" "Why?" "Why?" "Why?" "Why?"

00:50.879 --> 00:53.080
It sounds like she wants to know why.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.120
- Poor Carol.
- "Poor Carol"? What about me?

00:56.120 --> 00:59.199
- I need help!
- If she's still chasing after you,

00:59.199 --> 01:01.158
she needs the help.

01:01.159 --> 01:04.160
Shag someone else,
she'd know there wasn't a chance.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.719
- How's he gonna manage that?
- Good point.

01:06.719 --> 01:11.999
- (Susan) Set up Carol with someone.
- Well, we'd need a really hopeless case.

01:11.999 --> 01:15.009
- How about Simon?
- (Simon) What about JP?

01:15.840 --> 01:19.690
You thought he was desperate enough
to go out with you.

01:19.999 --> 01:22.479
JP and Carol, I don't think so.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.120
But you think me and Carol's all right?

01:25.120 --> 01:27.719
He'd be in my top five staff members.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.199
Why?

01:29.199 --> 01:32.209
He's good-looking,
intelligent, charming...

01:32.839 --> 01:36.619
He's OK in a handsome,
great fun, clichéd kind of way.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.840
You don't find him a little bit irritating?

01:39.840 --> 01:42.239
No. Why, do you?

01:42.240 --> 01:45.250
No, I just threw it in there as a question.

01:46.959 --> 01:49.959
(Slot machine bleeps and pays out)

01:51.160 --> 01:54.160
(♪ The Hives: Hate To Say I Told You So)

02:16.719 --> 02:19.799
(Pedestrian crossing bleeps,
brakes screech)

02:26.559 --> 02:28.558
See you there.

02:28.559 --> 02:30.839
♪ Do what I want cos I can and if I don't

02:30.839 --> 02:33.839
- ♪ Because I wanna ♪
- (Horn pips)

02:35.360 --> 02:38.790
- ♪ Be ignored by the stiff... ♪
- (Mobile beeps)

02:38.920 --> 02:41.920
- How many's that?
- Six, so far.

02:43.279 --> 02:47.159
I don't understand
the fucking hysteria around the bloke.

02:47.159 --> 02:50.159
- Who's getting hysterical?
- Well, you.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.660
- Till he knocked you back.
- It was just a passing thing.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.760
Look at that. See?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.880
What about that lab assistant, Tricia?

03:03.719 --> 03:06.160
The one who smells of sulphur? Ugh.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.158
Occupational hazard.

03:08.159 --> 03:10.800
You don't need to go out with someone.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.040
You just need to look like
you're going out with someone.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.999
Or if every time Carol's around,

03:15.999 --> 03:19.569
she sees you with someone else,
laughing, chatting.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.999
Eventually,
she'll put one and one together.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.999
That is genius.

03:39.479 --> 03:42.839
Penny's got no idea
what a sad little perv you are.

03:42.839 --> 03:45.359
She's the only woman
who wouldn't run a mile

03:45.359 --> 03:48.559
if you stood next to her
for more than 30 seconds.

03:48.559 --> 03:51.559
(Kurt) Perfect.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.880
Sit.

03:56.559 --> 04:00.759
These are the amended schedules
and timetables, as promised.

04:00.919 --> 04:03.919
Sorry they're late.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.439
- Please get to know them.
- Hi.

04:06.439 --> 04:09.760
Pupils gormlessly wandering
the corridors we can cope with

04:09.760 --> 04:12.770
but I'd like to avoid staff doing the same.

04:17.238 --> 04:21.279
I'm starting gate monitors
for the beginning and end of school.

04:21.279 --> 04:25.520
Liz has very kindly drawn up a rota
and this week's winners are

04:25.520 --> 04:27.478
Mr McKenna

04:27.479 --> 04:29.799
and Mr Keating.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.120
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't do it tonight, Clare.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.959
(Low growl)

04:33.960 --> 04:35.570
(Arctic wind whistling)

04:37.919 --> 04:40.919
(Profound subterranean rumbling)

04:46.319 --> 04:49.319
- Sorry?
- (Eruption crashes)

04:49.400 --> 04:52.479
I'm expecting a delivery of videos
for the languages lab.

04:52.479 --> 04:56.539
I don't want valuable resources
sitting around unattended.

04:59.919 --> 05:02.999
Fine. Referring down
to the reserves. Simon.

05:03.359 --> 05:06.359
I've... got stuff on today, too.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.280
- What, at the end of school?
- Could be.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.500
(Clare) Put down Mr Casey.
Any more questions?

05:15.079 --> 05:18.079
- (Kurt) Ahem!
- Yes, Mr McKenna.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.560
You wanted to say something?

05:21.560 --> 05:25.760
Er, no, just, er, looking forward to...
monitoring the gate.

05:26.879 --> 05:29.879
(Sighs) Thank you, everyone.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.720
How the hell did JP
get out of monitoring?

05:35.720 --> 05:38.960
- Dazzled Clare with his charm.
- We can all be charming.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.758
Go on, then.

05:40.759 --> 05:43.160
It's not something you can just turn on.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.160
I thought that was exactly what it was.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.998
- Clare?
- Problem?

05:57.999 --> 06:00.999
No, I just...

06:01.840 --> 06:04.920
Keen as I am to be seen
as a responsible and

06:05.520 --> 06:08.530
- reliable member of staff...
- Your point?

06:09.599 --> 06:13.000
I was wondering if I might
be excused monitoring today.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.839
Why?

06:14.840 --> 06:17.960
I had planned to talk
to a couple of my year 11s

06:17.960 --> 06:21.530
straight after school
about their projected grades.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.439
Talk to them tomorrow.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.570
Plus, I'm not feeling 100%,
a touch of the stomach troubles

06:30.400 --> 06:33.358
and I'd really appreciate...

06:33.359 --> 06:36.400
- You're not still pulling that one?
- What?

06:36.400 --> 06:39.839
"The tropical disease
I picked up in Malaysia" routine.

06:39.839 --> 06:42.439
But I was doing all right until then, yeah?

06:42.439 --> 06:46.219
Constant reinvention
is the key to a successful skive.

06:46.599 --> 06:48.489
- Ask your pupils.
- (Buzz)

06:49.919 --> 06:51.520
(Girl) A Marechal Niel?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.919
(Boy) No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.

06:53.919 --> 06:56.679
- Why?
- Because you are like a pink rose,

06:56.679 --> 06:59.678
- Cousin Cicely.
- What's missing here?

06:59.679 --> 07:02.559
Brandon sounds bored.
He should be more...

07:02.559 --> 07:05.399
- What? Charming?
- Yeah.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.400
OK? And what is charm?

07:08.520 --> 07:12.039
Being nice to someone.
Making them feel good and special.

07:12.039 --> 07:14.920
But isn't it really being nice
to get what you want?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.918
S'pose.

07:16.919 --> 07:19.919
- And what does he want?
- Her.

07:20.199 --> 07:23.199
So he's using it to get into her knickers.

07:24.399 --> 07:28.399
- What does that tell you about charm?
- It's getting what you want.

07:28.399 --> 07:30.519
That it's essentially fake.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.519
(Laughter and talking outside)

07:32.519 --> 07:35.119
Why does it work?

07:35.120 --> 07:39.640
It works because people are suckers
for being told how great they are.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.039
- (Laughing gets louder)
- What the hell's going on?!

07:43.039 --> 07:48.080
Sorry, Mr Casey. We were trying to tell
jokes in French and we got carried away.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.080
- It was just...
- No, we were being disruptive.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.720
Can't you lot be more like
Mr Casey's class? They're quiet.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.198
- They were loud earlier.
- Sorry.

07:57.199 --> 07:59.479
Don't worry about it.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.480
Do you wanna go through?

08:03.399 --> 08:06.399
Sorry.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.559
Right... where were we?

08:15.560 --> 08:18.560
Charm works
because people are suckers.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.000
(Kurt) Got to get
Carol and Penny in the same room,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.680
then make it look like Penny's
interested in me. Not too difficult.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.318
(Brian) Men have walked on the moon.

08:29.319 --> 08:32.318
Pass it, you big twat!

08:33.320 --> 08:36.198
(Boy) On the wing! Chris, he's out there!

08:36.200 --> 08:39.200
Hey.

08:40.279 --> 08:42.999
(Brian) Imagine the look
on my friends' faces

08:42.999 --> 08:44.920
if I turned up with her on me arm.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.999
I am your friends.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.200
- You'd be surprised, wouldn't you?
- I'd be fucking amazed.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.890
But you wouldn't ask her out,
would you? Seriously?

08:56.240 --> 08:58.278
Nah.

08:58.279 --> 09:02.239
I wouldn't go for Penny
under normal circumstances either.

09:02.239 --> 09:06.019
- Lovely girl but it'd get too complicated.
- Exactly.

09:07.239 --> 09:10.200
Best to keep it all
on a professional standing.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.679
That way, you avoid hurting anyone.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.239
(Brian) And making a tit of yourself.

09:15.239 --> 09:18.199
Hey. (Hiccups)

09:18.200 --> 09:20.759
- (Kurt) Where you going?
- Office.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.999
(Hiccups)

09:23.000 --> 09:25.319
Must be something I've eaten.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.240
- Talk about Penny again.
- Why?

09:27.240 --> 09:30.119
- Just talk about her again.
- Lovely tits.

09:30.119 --> 09:33.078
- (Hiccups)
- Now something else.

09:33.079 --> 09:35.239
Barnsley were robbed Saturday.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.520
You only hiccup when it's to do with her.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.740
- Bollocks.
- Must be a stress-related reflex.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.359
It'll be that kebab I finished for breakfast.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.480
- (Hiccups)
- Stop thinking about her.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.278
- How's it going?
- Great.

09:48.279 --> 09:52.000
If you're up for it tonight,
I'm going to this new bar.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.599
Always ready to broaden our horizons.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.590
You've had a lot of experience
with females, haven't you?

09:59.319 --> 10:03.169
- You're asking for advice about women?
- We need help.

10:03.279 --> 10:06.640
Well, I might not be
the authority you think I am.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.640
You've got to be better than us.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.519
Backs of the thighs are my favourite.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.520
Are you coming for a drink?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.838
Sorry, are you talking to me?

10:22.839 --> 10:25.279
We thought
we'd try somewhere different.

10:25.279 --> 10:28.279
- Who's we?
- JP suggested somewhere.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.719
Won't I be in the way? If you're gonna
beg for a second chance...

10:32.719 --> 10:35.719
Shut up now.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.959
How's that gonna work?

10:37.960 --> 10:39.918
That's what I said.

10:39.919 --> 10:45.280
If you have to do this, don't sneak
around like idiots, talk to Penny direct.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.158
What are they talking about?

10:48.159 --> 10:51.449
I'm only halfway through
my lip-reading course.

10:55.839 --> 10:58.839
Who's on for tonight? Simon?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.079
Hands up who remembers me

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
suggesting going
to another pub last week.

11:05.239 --> 11:08.040
- You suggested a shithole.
- This place is all right.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.080
- I think I'll go down the pub.
- Why?

11:10.080 --> 11:13.860
- Because I like the pub.
- Let's go to the pub, then.

11:15.039 --> 11:17.319
You don't have to go just cos I'm going.

11:17.319 --> 11:19.760
- I like the pub, too.
- You don't have to.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.119
- Yeah, I know.
- As long as we're clear.

11:22.119 --> 11:25.119
That's... settled... then.

11:25.159 --> 11:28.320
- You're going to the pub now?
- Looks like it.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.240
What if I was looking forward
to a night away from you lot?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.919
♪ ..folks who knew me well,
they'll say, nice boy

11:34.919 --> 11:37.919
♪ He's always been well behaved

11:38.560 --> 11:40.838
♪ Kind of strange... ♪

11:40.839 --> 11:43.839
Another day ends and the pub beckons.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.919
Actually, I think I might
give it a miss tonight.

11:47.919 --> 11:51.979
That's a turnaround, isn't it?
From social secretary to...

11:53.359 --> 11:55.199
antisocial secretary.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.599
I just decided to have a night on me own.

11:57.599 --> 12:00.440
It's women who are supposed
to have the mood swings.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.320
- You're starting to sound like Simon.
- Is he all right?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.540
Are you talking physically
or psychologically?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.798
He seems pissed off about something.

12:10.799 --> 12:12.959
He's always pissed off.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.000
It's like I've done something
to wind him up.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.780
Being a likeable, entertaining,
half-decent human being

12:20.759 --> 12:24.320
who gets on with his friends
has something to do with it.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.760
Plus the fact that most of the women
in the school fancy you.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.320
Would it make a difference
if he knew I was gay?

12:30.320 --> 12:34.080
You're male and under 25.
He's looking over his shoulder.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.200
Don't worry. It's fun watching him
run around like a mental case,

12:38.200 --> 12:41.210
trying to read you
and getting it so wrong.

12:41.439 --> 12:44.439
- Excellent.
- (Susan laughs)

12:45.480 --> 12:47.918
(Slot machine bleeps)

12:47.919 --> 12:50.919
(Hiccups)

12:53.439 --> 12:56.439
There's a quiz night here
on a Wednesday.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.358
Really?

12:59.359 --> 13:02.359
(Susan) Make a note in your diary.

13:02.679 --> 13:05.679
(Simon) OK, top five
world leaders' wives.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.918
Hillary Clinton,

13:10.919 --> 13:13.519
- Mrs Gorbachev.
- Imelda Marcos.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.678
Is this what you always do?

13:15.679 --> 13:18.278
- (Simon) No.
- Yes it is.

13:18.279 --> 13:21.279
It's only the categories that change.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.640
I can't take any more stimulation.
I'm heading home.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.910
Thank you for the recreation
of my Auntie Margaret's funeral.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.520
(Penny) I've got a game,
if anyone fancies playing it.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.520
(Susan) Anything.

13:36.839 --> 13:38.920
What are you thinking right now?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.240
- What?
- You say it, that's the game.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.719
- That's not a game.
- It is, what were you thinking?

13:43.719 --> 13:46.399
Fantastic tits. (Hiccups)

13:46.400 --> 13:49.400
- What?
- Did I say that out loud?

13:49.560 --> 13:53.399
Er, maybe it's not such a great game
to play in present company.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.059
I can't take all the credit, actually.

13:58.199 --> 14:01.039
- They're not real?
- Had them done three years ago.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.560
- How could you afford that?
- On HP.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.559
They're false?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.199
They still look and feel like the real thing.

14:08.199 --> 14:11.199
- Do they?
- Feel 'em.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.919
Erm...

14:32.159 --> 14:35.159
Christ.

14:40.359 --> 14:42.439
Oh, I thought they'd be hard.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.839
No, you have to massage them
every day when they're first in.

14:45.839 --> 14:48.279
- Keep them malleable.
- Don't they feel weird?

14:48.279 --> 14:50.439
- You get used to it.
- And, er,

14:50.439 --> 14:52.520
are the nipples still sensitive?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.520
Very.

14:59.479 --> 15:02.439
Congratulations. You're the first person

15:02.440 --> 15:06.439
to have maintained their full attention
for, er, 30 seconds.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.439
31 ...32...

15:13.400 --> 15:15.119
(Simon sighs)

15:15.120 --> 15:18.120
Don't sit here all night. Cheers.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.399
(Susan) See you tomorrow.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.400
Same time, same place.

15:29.239 --> 15:31.278
What did he mean by that?

15:31.279 --> 15:33.760
He meant don't sit
in here drinking all night.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.599
No, he meant don't sit in here too long
cos it's a shithole.

15:37.599 --> 15:41.729
And cheers meant, "Thanks for
reinforcing my preconceptions

15:41.839 --> 15:44.760
"about what this evening
was gonna be like."

15:44.760 --> 15:48.319
Anything to be read into
the way he put on his jacket?

15:48.319 --> 15:52.359
How does he manage to make
me feel like a complete wanker?

15:52.359 --> 15:55.000
He doesn't have to work hard to do that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.200
- He shouldn't even be here.
- Why not?

15:57.200 --> 16:00.039
Because he hasn't
been around long enough.

16:00.039 --> 16:04.320
You wait to get invited in,
then you do the apprenticeship thing,

16:04.320 --> 16:08.450
work your way up to acceptance
until you achieve inclusion.

16:08.479 --> 16:13.729
Then, and only then, can you suggest
an alternative place to fucking drink.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.760
You don't think
you're overreacting a little bit?

16:17.760 --> 16:20.760
- No.
- It's totally understandable.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.720
- What is?
- You feeling a bit... resentful.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.678
I do not feel resentful.

16:27.679 --> 16:30.039
What then? Challenged, threatened?

16:30.039 --> 16:33.360
Give me one good reason
why I should feel threatened.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.770
He's new, therefore, novel.
He's young, smart, funny, charming,

16:39.919 --> 16:45.029
enthusiastic, reliable, responsible,
gets on with the staff and the kids,

16:45.520 --> 16:48.530
does his job well,
appeals to both women...

16:49.400 --> 16:51.199
and men,

16:51.200 --> 16:54.200
has good taste, good teeth,
a good body...

16:55.840 --> 16:58.840
I only asked... for one.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.959

18:26.199 --> 18:28.800
You wouldn't get the words out,
you soppy git.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.119
- I can't help it.
- False tits, though.

18:31.119 --> 18:33.799
False leg, who gives a fuck?

18:33.800 --> 18:37.650
What happens if she doesn't
keep up on the HP payments?

18:37.759 --> 18:40.559
Do they come round
and take them back?

18:40.560 --> 18:44.340
Hopefully, they go for
the television and video first.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.278
(JP) Morning, lads.
(Kurt) Morning.

18:51.279 --> 18:52.779
(Muttering)

18:53.479 --> 18:55.479
Go for it.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.480
Remember, it's pretend.

19:03.359 --> 19:06.359
Hey!

19:15.920 --> 19:18.920
(Sighs)

19:19.759 --> 19:23.049
- He's blowing it.
- Get in there and help him.

19:39.719 --> 19:42.719
(Loud hiccup)

19:42.999 --> 19:45.078
You've still got them, then.

19:45.079 --> 19:48.079
What? (Hiccups) What?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.759
Hiccups.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.760
Not really.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.239
Erm...

20:00.240 --> 20:03.120
Kurt wants to know
if you'll help him with something.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.120
Er, it's... delicate.

20:07.599 --> 20:10.358
Very... delicate. (Hiccups)

20:10.359 --> 20:13.789
Concerning a certain assistant
to a head teacher.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.358
(Brian) Who wears glasses.

20:17.359 --> 20:20.680
Carol's having trouble coming to terms
with her split from Kurt.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.079
- Oh, no.
- He wants to make clear to her

20:23.079 --> 20:25.920
that it's over without upsetting her again.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.640
So he needs someone,
a new girlfriend, to be seen with.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.680
You want me to go out with Kurt?

20:31.680 --> 20:34.680
(Loudly) Pretend. It's only... pretend.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.318
- Why don't you talk to her?
- l-l can't.

20:38.319 --> 20:41.919
She's hanging on, it's doing her no good.
She's making herself ill.

20:41.919 --> 20:43.958
That's awful.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.719
- I knew you'd understand.
- I meant for Carol.

20:46.719 --> 20:51.520
Now you mention it, I did sense
a lot of negative energy in that office.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.758
We need to let her down gently.

20:53.759 --> 20:56.920
And you think this is the best
thing for both of you?

20:56.920 --> 20:59.640
I just don't wanna rub salt in the wounds.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.560
I've got a free period.
We can talk it through.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.599
I've got a lesson now,
could we do it (hiccups) later?

21:05.599 --> 21:08.599
Let's go.

21:11.159 --> 21:14.449
In a dormant volcano,
the hump is more rounded.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.600
Like a... like a...

21:18.760 --> 21:20.598
Like a what, sir?

21:20.599 --> 21:23.599
Er, (hiccups)...

21:24.039 --> 21:27.039
rounded thing.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.400
I think Kurt's planning
to break our agreement.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.479
What agreement?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.999
That neither of us
is going to go after Penny.

21:45.999 --> 21:49.399
That they're just gonna pretend
to be an item for Carol.

21:49.399 --> 21:53.739
- This is JP's plan?
- It'll work if Kurt doesn't bollocks it.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.760
Have you checked out
gate monitors for today?

21:56.760 --> 22:00.750
- You're down to fill in for JP.
- He must be busy again.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.199
Amazing how busy he keeps himself.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.239
He must have another delivery.

22:05.239 --> 22:08.809
- He really had one yesterday?
- If he says he did.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.160
JP, Brian wants a quick word with you.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.199
- Do I?
- He's, er,

22:16.200 --> 22:18.679
he's got badminton after school.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.880
Now he's covering for you,
he's got this gate monitor stuff on.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.079
- Why didn't you say so?
- He is saying so now.

22:26.079 --> 22:28.159
If it's a problem, I can do it.

22:28.159 --> 22:29.769
No delivery today then?

22:30.359 --> 22:32.400
Yeah, but if Brian can't cover...

22:32.400 --> 22:36.199
Busy department, languages.
Do they deliver one tape at a time?

22:36.199 --> 22:38.679
They changed it last minute to today.

22:38.679 --> 22:41.599
But if it's difficult, I'll do the monitoring.

22:41.599 --> 22:44.559
- (Brian) Cheers, mate.
- Not a problem.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.560
That's that sorted.

22:51.319 --> 22:54.319
- He's cleverer than I thought.
- Is he?

22:54.639 --> 22:57.160
He said "yes" cos he knew
I was testing him.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.639
He didn't wanna look bad. You wait.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.959
He'll be palming it off
onto someone else in five minutes.

23:02.959 --> 23:05.959
(Bell)

23:08.239 --> 23:11.759
After negotiation, emotional blackmail
and the odd white lie,

23:11.759 --> 23:15.520
Penny agreed to help.
We liaise in the office in five minutes.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.599
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

23:17.599 --> 23:21.720
- Penny and I can handle it.
- This is all as we discussed, right?

23:21.720 --> 23:25.570
- What did we discuss?
- You know, about complications?

23:26.520 --> 23:30.440
Kurt and a woman?
Complications come with the territory.

23:32.319 --> 23:35.319
- I'm coming in.
- Fine.

23:36.359 --> 23:39.359
- Ready?
- When you are.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.760
(Hiccups)

23:56.680 --> 23:58.760
- How's it going?
- All right.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.760
- All right.
- How are you, er,

24:02.199 --> 24:04.838
getting on with the new bloke?

24:04.839 --> 24:07.200
Er, don't have him
but he seems all right.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.200
You, er... You, er... like him?

24:11.400 --> 24:13.398
Yeah, he's all right.

24:13.399 --> 24:15.009
As all right as, say...

24:17.600 --> 24:19.398
me?

24:19.399 --> 24:21.639
Yeah.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.078
No...

24:24.079 --> 24:26.519
worse or better?

24:26.520 --> 24:29.398
No.

24:29.399 --> 24:32.198
You don't find him a bit too pushy?

24:32.199 --> 24:35.199
No.

24:35.639 --> 24:38.639
Not a bit too cheerful?

24:38.680 --> 24:41.680
- I quite like that.
- Good, good.

24:44.239 --> 24:47.239
Good.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.480
- What was that all about?
- Fuck knows.

24:57.999 --> 25:00.999
Hi. Is Carol around?

25:01.119 --> 25:04.639
She's chasing up stationery supplies.
Will I not do?

25:04.639 --> 25:07.639
- Not for this, no.
- Intriguing.

25:10.119 --> 25:11.619
Penny, how are you?

25:12.439 --> 25:15.439
- Good. Er, you?
- Yeah, very... good.

25:15.519 --> 25:17.718
Er, great to see you.

25:17.719 --> 25:19.758
(Hiccups)

25:19.759 --> 25:22.759
- Is Carol coming back soon?
- Why?

25:22.839 --> 25:25.200
- No reason.
- Why do you want to see her?

25:25.200 --> 25:28.200
I'll... try again later.

25:28.239 --> 25:31.118
- Erm, thanks, Liz.
- Er...

25:31.119 --> 25:34.639
Didn't you wanna get something
from the office, from Carol?

25:34.639 --> 25:38.040
- Carol's not here.
- And I can't help, apparently.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.040
So, I'm-I'm leaving.

25:41.799 --> 25:43.558
(Hiccups)

25:43.559 --> 25:45.480
- What were you doing?
- What?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.320
- You know what.
- Give me a hint.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.238
Your fucking arm around Penny.

25:50.239 --> 25:52.959
- What about it?
- We had an agreement.

25:52.959 --> 25:55.959
So?

25:56.520 --> 25:59.479
This is a selfless act
Penny's performing, to help Carol.

25:59.479 --> 26:01.198
You think so.

26:01.199 --> 26:04.600
Who else would have agreed
to appear as your girlfriend?

26:04.600 --> 26:07.600
- You tell me.
- No one.

26:07.759 --> 26:10.439
Exactly. So why do you think she did?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.279
- And don't say to help Carol.
- Why else?

26:13.279 --> 26:16.199
- Maybe she enjoys it.
- Bollocks!

26:16.200 --> 26:21.760
If she's willing to appear as my girlfriend,
maybe she fancies being my girlfriend.

26:21.760 --> 26:26.170
And if she does, I'd be an idiot
to pass it up, wouldn't I? Eh?

26:32.679 --> 26:35.919
I don't think I can stand
that pub for another night.

26:35.919 --> 26:38.919
We're not going to the pub.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.440
Aren't we?

26:44.360 --> 26:48.039
There's a karaoke night on
at the bar JP was talking about.

26:48.039 --> 26:51.039
I'd rather have my arms
hacked off with a rusty chisel.

26:51.039 --> 26:53.519
- That can be arranged.
- I'm going to the pub.

26:53.519 --> 26:56.200
I thought you couldn't stand
another night there.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.599
- At least it'll be quiet.
- Because you'll be on your own.

26:59.599 --> 27:02.599
- I do have other friends.
- Who?

27:02.879 --> 27:06.799
I don't need fucking Jim-Bob
to organise my social life.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.159
What are you scared of,
that it'll be a good night?

27:10.159 --> 27:13.600
- I know it'll be a good night.
- So why not come?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.640
Because I've got better things to do

27:15.640 --> 27:20.820
than reinforce the false impression
that I don't have better things to do.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.920
Are you feeling rejected
by your friends, ignored?

27:23.920 --> 27:26.319
I feel like part of the fucking furniture.

27:26.319 --> 27:28.840
There are no easy answers
to an identity crisis.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.200
- This isn't an identity crisis.
- Classic case.

27:33.879 --> 27:38.600
Are people finding me less interesting,
do I need to... reinvent myself?

27:38.600 --> 27:41.480
You can't suddenly
become what you're not.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.759
You have your own peculiar appeal.

27:43.759 --> 27:46.839
A kind of whingeing,
useless, moaning charm.

27:46.920 --> 27:51.470
That's why I come to you. You always
make me feel so much better.

27:52.719 --> 27:55.719
It's not a competition
between you and JP.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.920
(Quiet humming)

28:23.400 --> 28:26.400
(Quietly hums)

28:28.240 --> 28:30.478
Something we can do for you?

28:30.479 --> 28:33.629
No, I was just...
just checking the new rota.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.440
(Sighs)

28:39.480 --> 28:41.919
Been a... long day.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.398
- Yep.
- (Carol continues humming)

28:44.399 --> 28:47.399
Tired. Need to... unwind.

28:50.079 --> 28:52.078
Dry throat.

28:52.079 --> 28:55.579
Is this list of mundane ailments
leading anywhere?

28:56.559 --> 28:59.439
Oh, I was just thinking, you...

28:59.440 --> 29:01.960
You don't fancy a drink tonight, do you?

29:01.960 --> 29:04.640
- Has everyone else died?
- No, I just...

29:04.640 --> 29:07.640
thought you might fancy
going for a drink.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.970
- Where are the other two?
- I don't know and I don't care.

29:12.840 --> 29:17.039
You've had a falling out
and you've got no one else to play with.

29:17.039 --> 29:19.039
- Do you wanna go for a drink?
- Love to.

29:19.039 --> 29:22.329
- Great.
- But unfortunately, I'm already busy.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.038
(Carol continues humming)

29:27.039 --> 29:30.039
How about... you?

29:30.559 --> 29:33.559
- She's busy, too.
- Thought I'd ask.

29:35.839 --> 29:38.360
(Susan) Pretend I'm Penny. Talk to me.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.360
(Brian) You look nothing like her.

29:55.559 --> 29:57.059
- Better?
- (Hiccups)

29:57.439 --> 30:00.439
Good. Go again.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.519
- Une pipe.
- Une pipe.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.520
(Laughing)

30:10.599 --> 30:14.869
I, er, don't suppose you fancy
going out for a drink tonight.

30:15.359 --> 30:17.758
- No, right. Stupid idea.
- Drink?

30:17.759 --> 30:20.600
- Yeah, just a thought.
- Where, in a pub?

30:20.600 --> 30:24.310
- That's the general idea.
- Yeah, I'd love to. Yeah.

30:25.079 --> 30:26.579
Thanks for asking.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.719
- Sort out Brian?
- If he stops hiccuping,

30:33.719 --> 30:36.839
he starts belching.
We've stuck to the hiccups.

30:36.839 --> 30:39.279
- Sorted out your evening?
- Yes.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.880
I don't know why
you're letting this get to you.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.660
I don't like that my friends
are suddenly his friends.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.600
Maybe it's because you're similar.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.600
You like the same people,
the same people like you.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.800
Except they seem to like him more.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.160
They just haven't found
his irritating bits yet.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
I-I-I've got irritating bits?

30:59.919 --> 31:03.080
Stunted emotions,
the need to be centre of attention,

31:03.080 --> 31:05.119
the constant reassurance needed.

31:05.119 --> 31:09.280
- Isn't, isn't that everyone?
- Only once you get to know them.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.280
So, he's similar to me but newer?

31:14.079 --> 31:16.720
- It's a theory.
- And, therefore, more...

31:16.720 --> 31:19.319
exciting and attractive?

31:19.320 --> 31:23.030
- Well...
- You're saying he's like me... but better.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
(Susan) Have you got homes to go to?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.360
Thank you.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.359
It's sabotage.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.519
I did not nick your deodorant
or your hair gel. All right?

31:43.519 --> 31:46.519
Look at me, for fuck's sake.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.120
- You definitely not coming?
- How's it going with Kurt?

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
- OK.
- Why are you doing it?

31:59.839 --> 32:03.520
Chasing after somebody
who's not interested is the worst thing.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.440
- I've been there.
- You don't think it's unfair to her?

32:07.720 --> 32:10.720
No more unfair than your plan was.

32:13.039 --> 32:16.039
Can I ask you something?

32:16.159 --> 32:19.038
When you look at me, what do you see?

32:19.039 --> 32:22.039
I don't know. Erm, a teacher.

32:22.919 --> 32:24.958
You see a teacher first?

32:24.959 --> 32:27.359
Do I detect a crisis of identity here?

32:27.359 --> 32:29.039
Oh, for fuck's sake, no.

32:29.039 --> 32:31.199
I know all about identity crisises.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.840
From the age of 13 to 19, I was invisible.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.840
Literally?

32:37.040 --> 32:40.330
- When were you born?
- January 28th 1974. Why?

32:41.279 --> 32:44.279
Aquarius with Venus rising.

32:44.959 --> 32:46.639
Is that... is that good?

32:47.240 --> 32:50.810
The water carrier, erm,
single-minded but neurotic,

32:51.279 --> 32:53.720
prone to self-doubt and back problems.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.879
If you give me the time of day
that you were born,

32:56.879 --> 33:00.099
- I can do your chart.
- I don't need a chart.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.319
That's what everybody
who needs a chart says.

33:03.319 --> 33:05.358
What triggered this off?

33:05.359 --> 33:08.359
Er, I... I thought I knew who I was

33:09.000 --> 33:12.959
but I'm not him, apparently,
but I'm still trying to be him

33:12.959 --> 33:15.879
and not coming to terms
with who I really am

33:15.879 --> 33:19.379
and now someone else is him
and I'm... fuck knows.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.120
Believe me, you need a chart.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.960

You're sweating already.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.558
Oh, shit.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.799
Don't worry. Some women like that.

33:42.799 --> 33:45.879
Sweaty, smelly little blokes
with crap hair.

33:45.919 --> 33:48.918
What's going on with you and Penny?

33:48.919 --> 33:52.079
- Ah, you've noticed.
- She asked me about you.

33:52.079 --> 33:55.929
About any previous sexual deviancy
I might be aware of.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.050
This got anything to do
with you and Carol?

33:59.319 --> 34:03.279
What, someone can't be
interested in me for me? Is that it?

34:03.279 --> 34:08.520
It has to be part of some sordid little plan
cooked up to get Carol off my back?

34:08.520 --> 34:10.559
Well, thanks very much.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.960
I thought I was held
in a bit more esteem than that.

She's not remotely
fucking interested in Kurt.

34:51.399 --> 34:55.080
I mean, does she know about
Carol's psychotic tendencies?

34:55.080 --> 34:57.679
- We forgot to mention it.
- Shouldn't you?

34:57.679 --> 35:00.679
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

"Karaoke, yeah!"

- I don't want to go to fucking karaoke!

35:13.119 --> 35:15.240

35:44.319 --> 35:47.320

What?

41:30.239 --> 41:32.720
He didn't get the headship
at the third attempt

41:32.720 --> 41:34.759
and he hasn't had a shag in 23 years.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.349
- Fucking hell.
- That's what I said.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.360
So, how was, how was your evening?

41:44.440 --> 41:47.278
We got knocked back by Penny.

41:47.279 --> 41:49.878
You amaze me.

41:49.879 --> 41:52.719
We didn't bank on Jenny
shoving her oar in.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.719
So, the golden boy's plan failed.

41:58.239 --> 42:01.239
(♪ Stealin Beats: Kid Galahad)

42:06.759 --> 42:09.759
Hey!

42:12.240 --> 42:15.240

42:18.760 --> 42:21.038

- That's it?

42:38.999 --> 42:40.998
Yep.

You're in the clear, then.

♪ Swingers sway to town... ♪

42:57.320 --> 43:00.680
I heard it was a bit
of a disappointing evening.

43:00.839 --> 43:03.479
- It had its moments.
- So I hear.

43:03.480 --> 43:06.919
Kurt said it was like being kissed
by a vacuum cleaner.

43:06.919 --> 43:09.118
And how was Bob?

43:09.119 --> 43:12.199
We've got a much better understanding
of each other now.

43:12.199 --> 43:15.279
- Is that good or bad?
- It's gotta be good.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.599
- Sorry about last night.
- What?

43:20.600 --> 43:23.879
Well, I got the impression
it wasn't a great success.

43:23.879 --> 43:26.600
- It was all right, wasn't it?
- (Both) Yeah.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.600
(Mobile bleeps)

43:31.239 --> 43:34.040
That's the third
text message this morning.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.438
What does it say?

43:36.439 --> 43:38.119
"I know where you live."

43:47.480 --> 43:50.480
D'you get home all right?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.838
Course.

43:52.839 --> 43:56.899
You were out like a light
as soon as you hit the bus seat.

43:57.119 --> 44:01.039
- Got those lesson plans for me?
- I'll get them to you.

44:02.719 --> 44:05.239
- End of tomorrow, latest.
- Oh, I'll try.

44:05.239 --> 44:08.160
- Don't just try, do it.
- What's wrong with you?

44:08.160 --> 44:11.679
Just cos we go out for a drink,
it doesn't change anything here.

44:11.679 --> 44:15.949
I still want those plans
and I want them on time. Understand?

44:34.479 --> 44:36.800
Bob's even worse than he was before.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.920
Course he is, he's opened up to you.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.319
He's scared you're going to blab.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.839
I wouldn't want anyone knowing
I hadn't had sex in 23 years

44:44.839 --> 44:47.879
and I'd failed three times
to get the headship,

44:47.879 --> 44:50.760
- so I'm not about to blab.
- You just have.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.119
- Shit.
- He just needs reassuring.

44:53.119 --> 44:54.919
Who fucking doesn't?

44:54.920 --> 44:57.999
Still worried about becoming
part of the furniture?

44:57.999 --> 45:00.358
Nah. Should I be?

45:00.359 --> 45:04.079
No more than anyone else.
Just you're more Parker Knoll

45:04.079 --> 45:07.160
than Terence Conran
steamed beechwood recliner.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.160
- And JP's the recliner.
- For now.

45:10.200 --> 45:14.260
- Well, what are you?
- I'm more your wood-frame wingback.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.479
A common-sense buy
with added comfort.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.599
And in cupboard terms?

45:19.600 --> 45:22.640
You're a Welsh dresser
to his maple hi-fi unit.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.079
Single file down the corridors.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.879
Table?

45:26.880 --> 45:31.290
Mahogany-effect nest to his
blond wood glass-topped occasional.

45:31.879 --> 45:33.678
Shall I go on?

45:33.679 --> 45:36.678
So I'm functional rather than exciting.

45:36.679 --> 45:39.439
- Functional's good.
- But it's not dazzling.

45:39.439 --> 45:41.839
- You'll have your moments.
- Yeah?

45:41.839 --> 45:46.109
And I'd far rather sit on something
functional than dazzling.

45:47.039 --> 45:50.039
Are we still talking furniture?

45:50.280 --> 45:53.280
We are still talking furniture.
