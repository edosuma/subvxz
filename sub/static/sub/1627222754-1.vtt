01:06.734 --> 01:08.937
I am a public
defender.

01:13.473 --> 01:16.945
And there are only 15,000 of
me for the 10.5 million people

01:16.978 --> 01:18.980
who were arrested last year in
America.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.022
I work for a machine,

01:28.056 --> 01:30.223
that is the U.S. Criminal
Justice System.

01:33.962 --> 01:37.065
Once you fall in, it's
almost impossible to get out.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.269
For most of the prosecutors,

01:45.138 --> 01:45.974
the defenders,

01:49.242 --> 01:50.078
cops,

01:51.913 --> 01:53.748
and everyone else caught up in
the system,

01:57.986 --> 02:02.023
that's just the harsh
reality of the machine.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.359
Punk ass.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.531
All right, what do we
have here?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.034
But what
if reality isn't fixed?

02:16.203 --> 02:17.471
What if you can shape it?

02:20.173 --> 02:23.310
What if, hear me out, with a
little help,

02:23.343 --> 02:25.345
you can beat the system at its
own game?

02:33.988 --> 02:34.822
Okay, Mr.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.192
Ah-Chot, Ah-Chat.

02:40.061 --> 02:41.963
Yes, me, Ah-Chut.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.196
Were you selling batteries

02:43.230 --> 02:45.867
without a license on
the Downtown Six train?

02:45.900 --> 02:46.868
Huh?

02:46.901 --> 02:48.636
Batteries, license, you sell?

02:52.540 --> 02:53.841
Can we get a translator?

02:53.875 --> 02:55.475
No problem, what do you need?

02:56.844 --> 02:58.378
Chinese, Cantonese.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.279
Dreams are nice.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.214
I had them once.

03:01.248 --> 03:04.384
Oh damn, what am I
supposed to do with this?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.252
Home?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.423
No home, here, just overnight,
sorry.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.659
Home.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.964
Okay.

03:16.998 --> 03:18.566
One chance, you say nothing.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.466
The judge ask you anything.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.835
You nod, okay?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.770
As in now, nod if you
understand, sir.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.841
Judge ask, nod, okay?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.843
Right okay, that's it, all
right.

03:29.911 --> 03:32.312
People versus Ah-Chut, let's
go.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.982
People are fine with
a charge of 240 and 20

03:35.016 --> 03:36.416
and community service.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.919
That's our offer.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.588
Your Honor, my client has
been in the system 29 hours.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.156
The fine for discount alone,

03:42.190 --> 03:45.358
would ensure he's right back
out there selling Energizers.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.694
I believe it was
Duracell.

03:46.728 --> 03:48.495
Whatever, let's just do an
ACD.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.897
Send this gentleman back home

03:49.931 --> 03:51.999
where we could all go to
bed with a clean conscience.

03:52.033 --> 03:53.266
From the looks of you,

03:53.300 --> 03:55.235
bed isn't somewhere you
land often, Counselor?

03:55.268 --> 03:57.270
Sleep is for lawyers
who lose, Your Honor.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.740
Cute, but not really.

04:15.890 --> 04:19.827
Mr. Ah-Chut, do you understand
what your lawyer just said?

04:28.970 --> 04:30.370
- Approach please.
- No, no, no, no.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.371
He just nodded, Your Honor.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.206
It was subtle.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.273
He's a got a weak neck,

04:33.306 --> 04:35.375
- so let me just-
- Please, approach.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.244
Okay.

04:38.146 --> 04:40.480
Trying to slip your client by?

04:40.515 --> 04:42.817
- No, I'm not.
- Do not interrupt me.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.153
Like I would just rubber stamp
his plea.

04:45.186 --> 04:47.320
My client doesn't
speak a romance language,

04:47.354 --> 04:49.791
which leaves him stuck
in here another 12 hours.

04:49.824 --> 04:52.425
Then we'll just have
to see him tomorrow,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.762
and the constitution survives
another day.

05:17.018 --> 05:17.852
Next.

05:26.194 --> 05:30.031
I like them nails,
like Mona Lisa with bite.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.202
What's this?

05:35.402 --> 05:37.605
My buddy's car got jacked.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.273
I'm not sure whatever
it take to get it out,

05:39.307 --> 05:41.909
but, and that's the plate
number.

05:49.684 --> 05:50.885
Do you have the notarized
letter

05:50.918 --> 05:53.353
from the owner authorizing
you to pick it up?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.489
See, that's the thing that
dude's not exactly available.

05:58.326 --> 05:59.160
He's in Rikers.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.196
Yeah, I can't help you.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.802
Can you at least let me know
it's there.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.737
No paperwork, no car.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.605
Next!

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375
I thought we were hitting it
off here.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.044
I didn't know we were on a
date.

06:20.181 --> 06:21.249
Maybe we should be.

06:27.088 --> 06:29.056
Casi, my man, 50 grand.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.760
- Why so nonplussed, baby?
- Jimmy, what are you?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.061
- You look-
- Good?

06:34.095 --> 06:34.996
Good, yeah.

06:35.029 --> 06:37.565
It's all you, baby.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.867
The doctor you sent me to,
put me on your cocktail.

06:39.901 --> 06:42.370
Got me those transfusions,
to beat back the Hep C.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.505
I played two sets at Small's
last night,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.173
didn't have anything
stronger than the Sprite.

06:46.207 --> 06:47.407
Mr. Clean.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.010
Jimmy, I got him to
delay your sentencing

06:49.043 --> 06:50.410
based on you being sick.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.512
You got me well, baby.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.847
If the judge sees you this
way-

06:52.880 --> 06:54.749
- The T-count up to 800, check
it.

06:56.918 --> 06:57.952
Liver's looking good.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.189
Christ, you're healthier than
I am.

07:02.223 --> 07:04.091
That possession thing is
ancient, right?

07:04.125 --> 07:06.127
Ain't no way they're
gonna push for real time,

07:06.160 --> 07:07.962
now that they see I'm on the
narrow.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.197
They might, Jimmy.
Let me figure this out.

07:10.231 --> 07:11.132
Wait here, okay?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.774
From the previous
judge's files,

07:19.807 --> 07:22.977
I'm shocked to see Mr.
Coates so hale and hearty,

07:23.010 --> 07:25.445
- or breathing.
- Thank you.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.981
Mr. Coates looks fine to me.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.285
You have a recent medical
report.

07:31.319 --> 07:33.154
It's right there, Your Honor.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.423
It's from 90 days ago.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.258
When was the last
time you had a checkup?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.498
10-minute break, Counselor, in
chambers.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.971
- Casi, what's happening?
- I'll take care of it.

07:50.004 --> 07:51.739
She's saying that I
should've stayed sick,

07:51.772 --> 07:53.741
otherwise I go to jail?

07:53.774 --> 07:54.842
What's her plan?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.744
I hear Cuba's good this time
of year.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.979
I'll be right back, I got this.

07:58.012 --> 07:58.980
We're good, okay?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.452
It's a death sentence sending
him straight

08:04.518 --> 08:07.254
to a mandatory one and a half to
three.

08:07.288 --> 08:09.323
Do you get that this isn't a
contest?

08:10.191 --> 08:11.659
Your Honor.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.128
Showing up here with outdated
medical records,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.197
and the belief woefully
misplaced,

08:16.230 --> 08:18.199
that if you just talk fast
enough

08:18.232 --> 08:20.134
and flash those shiny veneers-

08:20.167 --> 08:21.702
- Now, they're real, I wore
braces-

08:21.736 --> 08:25.006
- Hey, hey, hey, I've
cited better PDs than you

08:25.039 --> 08:26.874
for a whole lot less.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.009
Can I speak frankly?

08:29.310 --> 08:31.512
Can we agree that treatment
is a better option

08:31.545 --> 08:32.780
than jail time?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.682
And why would we do
that, start agreeing?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.049
Sending a man to jail

08:36.082 --> 08:37.852
because he isn't dying
fast enough seems petulant.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.153
Even for you, Your Honor.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.522
Oh, I see that we're
still speaking frankly.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.289
Okay, I get what this is.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.625
You don't like me, that's
awesome.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.826
I probably agree with you
mostly,

08:45.860 --> 08:48.162
but Mr. Coates, shouldn't be a
casualty.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.564
There are treatment
options inside the penal-

08:50.598 --> 08:53.868
- He's working his treatment
on the outside and well,

08:53.901 --> 08:56.303
very well, sending him back to a
box.

08:56.337 --> 08:58.039
Treatment is not punishment.

08:58.072 --> 08:59.473
Yeah, unless you're white,
ex-urban,

08:59.508 --> 09:00.975
and the gateway drug was
introduced by a big pharma.

09:01.008 --> 09:01.909
It's so funny

09:01.942 --> 09:03.577
- how that works out.
- Get out.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.812
Okay, Your Honor, I just-

09:04.845 --> 09:06.781
- Unless you'd like an officer
to help.

09:08.883 --> 09:09.950
No, no, no.

09:16.424 --> 09:18.426
Sure Mr. Coates will be right
back?

09:18.459 --> 09:20.061
Oh, I have no doubt.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.096
That's the beauty of bench
warrants.

10:39.273 --> 10:41.909
And now, it's
that mysterious blackout

10:41.942 --> 10:44.345
that is leaving thousands of New
Yorkers-

10:44.378 --> 10:47.181
- Lock anyone away
tonight, chief?

10:47.214 --> 10:48.482
I work with the bad guys.

10:50.552 --> 10:52.419
My friend

10:52.453 --> 10:55.389
how can you defend someone
you know is guilty?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.697
Hundreds of people
are stuck in elevators,

11:03.731 --> 11:05.866
others stranded on the subway.

11:40.502 --> 11:41.335
Angus!

12:01.088 --> 12:02.489
Hey.

12:02.524 --> 12:03.424
My hero.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.393
Make thyself comfortable.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.195
That doesn't sound promising.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.231
Well, I'm worried about you.

12:10.264 --> 12:11.899
This place actually looks clean
for once.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.269
- Celebrating, the ripple.
- The what?

12:15.302 --> 12:16.737
Space time.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.205
They finally detected it.

12:18.239 --> 12:20.542
The fabric that binds us all
together.

12:20.575 --> 12:23.143
- Your friends at LIGO.
- Fucking bastards.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.412
A-ha.

12:25.446 --> 12:27.248
- Please say-
- No, false alarm.

12:27.281 --> 12:28.782
Great, and there I was this
close

12:28.816 --> 12:32.219
to the greatest sleep I've never
had.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.288
- How do you know?
- Know what?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.923
It's a great sleep.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.560
Let alone the greatest if you're
asleep.

12:39.594 --> 12:41.696
I know, my body knows.

12:41.730 --> 12:44.699
Your body is an imperfect
instrument for evaluation.

12:44.733 --> 12:45.734
The fact is, you don't know

12:45.766 --> 12:47.101
what's on the other side of
sleep.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.537
Oh work, in four hours.

12:49.571 --> 12:50.971
Hence, my need for those twin
set of keys

12:51.005 --> 12:52.773
I entrusted you with.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.074
A show of confidence

12:54.108 --> 12:55.776
and that feels woefully
misplaced, my friend.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.478
It's not what they
think it is, you know?

12:57.512 --> 12:58.713
Not exactly.

12:58.747 --> 13:00.247
- We still on sleep?
- The ripple.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.716
- Black hole.
- Right.

13:01.750 --> 13:05.085
We can now see the
unseeable and it's not stable.

13:05.119 --> 13:08.155
These blackouts we've been
experiencing are proof.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.927
What would you say if I
told you that the bindings

13:13.961 --> 13:16.930
of our universe are unraveling,

13:16.964 --> 13:20.301
that worlds we couldn't
previously conceive of

13:20.334 --> 13:22.102
are crashing into our own.

13:22.136 --> 13:24.606
I'd say, I'm fucking
sleeping on your couch tonight.

13:24.639 --> 13:25.674
And you'd be wrong.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.080
The shadow kingdom, what the
fuck?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.951
By all means, use my personal
computer.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.854
Oh Jesus fucking Christ!

14:13.887 --> 14:14.888
What are you doing?

14:14.922 --> 14:16.056
- Me?
- Yeah.

14:16.090 --> 14:18.192
Who said you could
get all up into my shit.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.193
I couldn't sleep.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.800
You didn't strike me
as a fan of the royals.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.401
The opposite, actually.

14:34.074 --> 14:34.908
Check it out.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.979
You notice anything funny?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.247
I don't even know what I'm
looking at.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.516
- Look!
- What?

14:42.550 --> 14:45.052
Her eyes, oh my God.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.755
She's got reptoid eyes.

14:46.788 --> 14:47.988
You're not serious.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.189
You know, House of Windsor,

14:49.223 --> 14:51.892
isn't the only bloodline bred
into power.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.061
But these people, if
you can call them that,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.063
they control everything.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.499
And look, it takes time to
absorb, I know.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.067
You seem like a nice guy,
Craig.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.536
Really.

15:01.569 --> 15:03.437
And I'd be happy to help you
get your friends car out,

15:03.470 --> 15:06.574
- but-
- So you checked?

15:06.608 --> 15:08.275
What?

15:08.308 --> 15:11.846
The uh, the Navigator's still
there?

15:11.880 --> 15:12.714
Yeah.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.552
Hey, you're lucky the city
hadn't auctioned it off yet.

15:17.585 --> 15:19.486
All right, okay.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.556
Thanks for the fuck.

15:21.589 --> 15:22.590
It's time to bounce.

15:24.958 --> 15:29.963
No, no, we still have
unfinished business between us.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.766
Any business you got
left can be taken care of

15:31.800 --> 15:33.300
by your hand.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.168
I'm tired.

15:35.936 --> 15:36.771
Okay.

15:39.473 --> 15:40.441
Let's start to bounce.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.747
Get the fuck out.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.316
I'm serious.

15:50.919 --> 15:55.924
You know, so am I.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.131
You catch anything
yesterday?

16:04.164 --> 16:06.668
Dead, like two class Cs.

16:06.701 --> 16:08.101
Oh, except for this guy.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.838
We had to stand around
waiting for the EMS guys

16:09.871 --> 16:10.971
to haul him off.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.407
Broken jaw, blood everywhere,
crying.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.776
Some old Chinese guy.

16:14.809 --> 16:15.710
What's his name?

16:17.211 --> 16:18.312
I don't know, Charlie Chan.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.581
What's his fucking name?

16:20.447 --> 16:21.448
Back off, asshole.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.350
I'm sorry.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.018
Look, I think he's a guy of
mine.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.788
He owe you money or
something?

16:26.821 --> 16:28.121
His name, please?

16:29.691 --> 16:30.525
Choo-Choo.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.026
Something like that.

16:35.229 --> 16:36.029
Dick.

16:53.748 --> 16:56.518
Tell me you didn't just
try to beat up two ADAs.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.285
- No.
- Holy shit.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.386
I would kiss you.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.688
- I would kiss you-
- What do you want?

17:00.722 --> 17:01.556
If I didn't have this little
sore.

17:01.589 --> 17:03.490
I can't quite ID, what I want?

17:03.525 --> 17:06.026
Well, I need you to do me
a little bit of a favor.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.862
I just caught an arraignment.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.696
Oh, a whole Office of
the Public Defender thing

17:09.731 --> 17:11.900
at the bottom of your paycheck
means something today.

17:11.933 --> 17:13.001
- Interesting.
- Right.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.402
Well, she's a former client of
yours

17:15.435 --> 17:16.738
and she wants you, slugger,

17:16.771 --> 17:19.071
which judging by her
ears is a mission I would

17:19.106 --> 17:20.508
dutifully accept.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.977
- Her ears?
- Her ears.

17:23.011 --> 17:24.746
I mean, they were so pretty.

17:24.779 --> 17:28.315
And you could say that they
bordered on sexually attractive,

17:28.348 --> 17:29.483
and it wasn't so much the lobe

17:29.517 --> 17:30.718
that was pretty either, Casi.

17:30.752 --> 17:32.720
- It was-
- So why didn't you?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.690
- What?
- You know, accept.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.693
Well, you and I both know

17:38.726 --> 17:40.662
that I'm likely to phone in a
defense

17:40.695 --> 17:42.697
if I feel that my client
doesn't share a belief

17:42.730 --> 17:46.066
in my unequivocated brilliance.

17:46.099 --> 17:51.940
And Lea Deleon, just so
happens to be an unbeliever.

17:51.973 --> 17:54.676
- What, Lea, Lea, Lea?
- Yeah.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.544
- She's back?
- Back.

17:56.578 --> 17:57.979
First name basis.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.015
It was meant to be.

18:01.049 --> 18:03.450
She was arrested last night
of possession of heroin.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.553
She wants to strike deal with
the cops.

18:05.587 --> 18:07.622
Okay, just leave it on my
desk.

18:07.655 --> 18:09.423
I'll deal with it later.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.860
Actually, she's already
at the DA's office.

18:12.894 --> 18:14.062
Are you fucking serious?

18:14.094 --> 18:15.262
You might actually
be a few minutes late.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.531
Fuck you Dane.

18:16.564 --> 18:19.132
- This is, really, now?
- I couldn't find you.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.602
I've been looking all over.

18:20.635 --> 18:23.370
Like now, like right this
second now?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.138
As soon as you can get there.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.808
- Thanks, buddy.
- You owe me one.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.155
Well, if it isn't my fresh out

18:42.189 --> 18:43.591
of law school sensation.

18:43.625 --> 18:44.993
Three years ago maybe,

18:45.026 --> 18:47.028
but in public defender time
one year is like 75, so.

18:47.929 --> 18:50.598
You don't look a day over 110.

18:53.034 --> 18:55.135
So, what'd you tell the AO?

18:55.168 --> 18:58.006
Nothing the H they found on me
didn't.

18:58.039 --> 18:59.406
- Jesus, Lea.
- It was total bullshit

18:59.439 --> 19:01.009
- how they picked me up.
- So what are you?

19:01.042 --> 19:03.811
You're muling for a
sketchy boyfriend again?

19:03.845 --> 19:04.679
Boyfriend, no.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.615
Sketchy is being generous.

19:07.649 --> 19:10.018
And technically, last time
I only went rented the cars

19:10.051 --> 19:12.486
for the mules, which as you
know,

19:12.520 --> 19:14.656
I had no idea about.

19:14.689 --> 19:15.623
But this you did?

19:16.490 --> 19:17.825
Yeah, I can't front on that.

19:17.859 --> 19:20.193
This guy, if he finds
out, I've been picked up,

19:23.564 --> 19:25.432
I need to walk out of here.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.534
I wish it was that easy.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.971
- I need to walk. Right now.
- Okay.

19:30.004 --> 19:34.207
Lea, if you violate your
promise after they let you out,

19:34.241 --> 19:35.543
you'll be begging for
the four to nine years,

19:35.576 --> 19:36.544
they're currently offering you.

19:36.577 --> 19:37.812
Four to nine.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.113
I might've plead you
down at two

19:39.147 --> 19:40.648
if you kept your mouth
shut about cooperating.

19:40.682 --> 19:43.183
Right, let the system do its
magic.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.485
You know how hard it is to live

19:45.520 --> 19:47.187
with a rap sheet hanging over
you?

19:48.990 --> 19:50.124
How hard I had to hustle

19:50.158 --> 19:52.060
to even get a shit job at the
tow pound?

19:54.428 --> 19:56.329
I have to get out, I have to get
out.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.397
All right, all right.

19:57.431 --> 19:58.900
So plead not guilty, and drop
bail.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.367
Look, if you're right about
this questionable stop,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.836
we have a shot at getting
this thing dismissed.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.270
- I promise you.
- Bail.

20:04.438 --> 20:05.740
Jesus, if I had 50,000,

20:05.773 --> 20:06.841
you'd think I'd be

20:06.874 --> 20:08.042
- in this mess?
- Whoa, whoa, 50,000?

20:08.076 --> 20:09.877
What judge set that number?

20:09.911 --> 20:12.345
- Some fat guy.
- That narrows it down.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.186
Okay, these baddies you're
rolling.

20:19.854 --> 20:21.321
Tell me everything.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.657
No lies, please.

20:26.728 --> 20:27.562
Early bird.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.100
Spread the wealth.

20:34.869 --> 20:38.072
So this guy, Craig,
approached me a few days ago,

20:38.106 --> 20:40.307
asking questions about
a car that was towed.

20:41.909 --> 20:42.944
Before he came in,

20:42.977 --> 20:44.579
he Googled everyone at the tow
pound,

20:44.612 --> 20:46.047
guess whose mugshot came up.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.851
Knowing I had a record,
he offered me 100 grand

20:49.884 --> 20:50.885
if I'd help him out.

20:52.053 --> 20:53.855
Help him, how?

20:53.888 --> 20:55.056
By grabbing a sample of the
heroin

20:55.089 --> 20:57.091
that was stashed inside that
Navigator.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.106
I thought it'd be easy money.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.742
Instead I was arrested
coming back from the preview.

21:16.677 --> 21:18.212
Preview for what?

21:18.246 --> 21:20.615
Craig needed the
sample to set up a deal.

21:20.648 --> 21:22.750
He plans to buy the car
at the tow pounds auction,

21:22.784 --> 21:24.652
before anyone else finds out
about it.

21:26.788 --> 21:28.288
So who did the drugs
belong to?

21:28.321 --> 21:29.624
A Mexican cartel.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.458
Jesus, Lea.

21:33.261 --> 21:34.494
Their mule lost the
cargo

21:34.529 --> 21:36.864
while he was visiting
his girlfriend in Queens.

21:38.699 --> 21:41.235
And the girlfriend
told Craig about it?

21:41.269 --> 21:44.038
Yeah, she was hooking
up with Craig on the side.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.407
Why?

21:47.440 --> 21:50.310
Why risk it?

21:50.343 --> 21:52.513
I was tired of my life.

21:52.547 --> 21:53.514
You're late.

21:53.548 --> 21:54.682
Just getting my game face on.

21:54.715 --> 21:56.083
There are other ways to the
game

21:56.117 --> 21:58.519
if you wanna trade that window
for a desk.

21:58.553 --> 22:00.855
And I saw an
opportunity to change it.

22:03.224 --> 22:04.859
So, I jumped.

22:21.909 --> 22:22.810
You warned me.

22:24.512 --> 22:25.345
About?

22:27.648 --> 22:29.550
The people I let into my life.

22:30.585 --> 22:31.953
I'm always letting myself be
chosen,

22:31.986 --> 22:32.920
I need to choose.

22:36.924 --> 22:39.126
Here come the detectives.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.828
Be careful of what you say,
okay?

22:52.039 --> 22:55.176
Okay, your story checks out.
Dates.

22:55.209 --> 22:57.712
When is the Navigator
set to be auctioned off?

22:57.745 --> 22:58.713
A week from Wednesday.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.480
You sure about that?

23:00.514 --> 23:03.217
Wednesday is the day it all
goes down.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.417
Win the car, win the dope.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.188
- What's the play?
- Play?

23:07.221 --> 23:09.357
There's a ton of
fucking dope in that car.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.092
You're selling it to someone,
who?

23:12.193 --> 23:13.194
It's a weird name.

23:13.227 --> 23:14.427
I can't tell you if he made it
up.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.428
I don't give a fuck
if the name is weird,

23:15.462 --> 23:17.365
- what's the fucking name?
- The Golem.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.203
That mean something to you
boys?

23:25.273 --> 23:26.874
What do you say?

23:26.908 --> 23:28.776
This is some Popeye Doyle level
shit.

23:30.144 --> 23:35.116
15 million and a big fish like
the Golem.

23:35.149 --> 23:37.251
Guess the risk is worth the
walk, I think.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.975
Hey baby, where you
been?

24:01.008 --> 24:03.644
What happened to radio
silence?

24:03.678 --> 24:05.445
The interweb was wonky
at my fleabag motel.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.714
So I figured I'd tap yours.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.849
Had a big Skype I couldn't miss.

24:09.984 --> 24:11.752
- Wanna know who with?
- Not really?

24:12.820 --> 24:14.588
- Guess.
- Meryl Streep.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.557
Reptoid, next.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.426
I'm not playing this game,
Craig.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.162
The Grand Resistor.

24:21.195 --> 24:23.496
- I don't know who that is.
- That's the thing.

24:23.531 --> 24:24.365
No one does.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.868
I took a screenshot of our
convo.

24:29.537 --> 24:30.371
Check it out.

24:31.439 --> 24:32.273
Freaky, right?

24:33.541 --> 24:35.209
I can't believe I swiped
right.

24:40.047 --> 24:42.850
Anyway, you still haven't told
me

24:42.883 --> 24:44.218
where you were last night.

24:45.619 --> 24:46.954
I slept over at a friend's.

24:46.988 --> 24:47.788
Friends, huh?

24:47.822 --> 24:49.557
Mm-hmm, yeah.

24:50.658 --> 24:51.659
Who is he?

24:52.793 --> 24:53.627
She.

24:54.729 --> 24:56.197
And who I fuck is my business.

24:56.230 --> 24:57.064
Nice.

25:02.536 --> 25:04.872
Come on, hop in.

25:06.407 --> 25:07.541
We got somewhere to be.

25:10.211 --> 25:12.713
You think I'm getting
in there with that?

25:12.747 --> 25:14.281
You're nuttier than I thought.

25:14.315 --> 25:15.349
Let's go.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.217
I ain't asking.

25:17.218 --> 25:18.519
You let her walk?

25:18.552 --> 25:19.887
I detect a note of skepticism.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.789
I worked in corporate America.

25:21.822 --> 25:23.157
I know a con when I see one.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.494
You're gonna find me
after like three days.

25:26.527 --> 25:27.862
A month, don't knock it.

25:32.233 --> 25:33.167
Whatever.

25:36.670 --> 25:37.972
Now, come on,

25:38.005 --> 25:40.207
how many felonies are you
handling?

25:40.241 --> 25:41.042
Right now?

25:41.075 --> 25:43.210
Oh, 80 something.

25:43.244 --> 25:46.247
All right, and how many
actually go to trial?

25:46.280 --> 25:47.882
I don't know, none.

25:50.351 --> 25:51.520
Booya motherfucker!

25:51.552 --> 25:52.887
Exactly, exactly.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.754
50 grand.

25:54.889 --> 25:56.323
Then I'll tap your ass out.

25:56.357 --> 25:57.158
I'll take that back.

25:57.191 --> 25:57.992
No, asshole.

25:58.025 --> 25:59.427
That's the bail they set.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.929
Instead of going to trial
and fighting a clean slate,

26:01.962 --> 26:04.398
the Lea's of the world plea,
why?

26:05.766 --> 26:07.835
Life's a bitch, and now it's
in heat?

26:07.868 --> 26:09.603
Did you believe in anything?

26:13.407 --> 26:16.610
All the sainted ones that
you lose so much sleep over,

26:16.644 --> 26:18.712
like that hottie you just helped
out.

26:20.214 --> 26:23.451
The only thing that can save
them, you don't have. Money.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.123
Your client, Mr. Coates, was
allowed

26:29.156 --> 26:33.127
to remain out pending
intermittent medical updates.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.796
The last of which revealed
him to be stable enough

26:35.830 --> 26:37.566
to appear for sentencing.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.734
During which, he left at great
delay

26:40.768 --> 26:42.803
and aggravation to the court.

26:42.837 --> 26:45.372
Per the statutory sentencing
requirements,

26:45.406 --> 26:47.741
the court will recommend
three to six years,

26:47.775 --> 26:49.910
pending the approval of the
Department of Probation.

26:49.944 --> 26:50.911
Your Honor, you have the power

26:50.945 --> 26:52.480
to waive a mandatory minimum

26:52.514 --> 26:53.747
- if you could just authorize-
- One more word

26:53.781 --> 26:55.816
while I am speaking.

26:57.351 --> 26:58.719
Are you aware of

26:58.752 --> 27:01.722
what Mr. Coates told the
court before your arrival?

27:01.755 --> 27:03.090
No, Your Honor.

27:03.124 --> 27:04.825
Mr. Coates claimed that you
told him

27:04.859 --> 27:07.294
to leave the courtroom on his
last visit.

27:08.829 --> 27:09.830
No, I did not.

27:09.864 --> 27:11.465
You suggested he jumped off to
Cuba.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.733
That was a joke.

27:12.766 --> 27:16.170
Ah, hence the jocularity
which has ensued.

27:16.203 --> 27:17.671
He'd just been told he's
rewarded

27:17.705 --> 27:19.173
for staying clean, for not
dying,

27:19.206 --> 27:20.641
was going to jail.

27:20.674 --> 27:24.812
But he inferred that you
meant for him to jump bail.

27:24.845 --> 27:27.915
I'm sorry, is that what
you believe, like personally?

27:27.948 --> 27:31.118
I'm sorry, Casi, she was
yelling at me.

27:31.152 --> 27:33.154
Got me all jammed up,
and I said, whatever,

27:33.187 --> 27:34.021
you mad?

27:35.789 --> 27:38.759
How could I be mad at
someone who plays like you?

27:38.792 --> 27:41.028
Ask me how many days I last
used?

27:42.997 --> 27:43.831
How many?

27:46.133 --> 27:46.967
105.

27:50.572 --> 27:51.640
One going in.

27:57.978 --> 28:00.447
Well, now that that's out of
the way,

28:00.481 --> 28:03.817
the only thing left to consider
is your conduct, Counselor.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.352
Am I being cited?

28:05.386 --> 28:07.721
A contempt proceeding is
career-ending

28:07.755 --> 28:09.490
for such a young attorney.

28:09.524 --> 28:11.292
With all due respect,

28:11.325 --> 28:13.994
- I've done this-
- Oh, why start now?

28:14.028 --> 28:16.163
You haven't done yourself
any favors before me.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.567
There are no complaints I'm
aware of.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.000
No?

28:20.034 --> 28:23.003
Then I would read the formal
complaint very closely,

28:23.037 --> 28:24.673
when it's submitted to your
superiors.

28:26.941 --> 28:28.643
Next docket.

28:59.773 --> 29:01.442
Come on, chop chop.

29:01.475 --> 29:04.111
Not until you tell me what's
going on.

29:04.144 --> 29:05.412
The Golem got in touch.

29:06.914 --> 29:08.415
I thought we were good to go.

29:08.449 --> 29:10.417
There's been a wrinkle.

29:10.451 --> 29:11.720
He says, I gotta show
up with who was with me

29:11.752 --> 29:12.654
at the preview.

29:13.787 --> 29:14.589
Aka you.

29:15.990 --> 29:16.957
- Come on.
- No.

29:20.427 --> 29:21.962
What is this place?

29:21.996 --> 29:24.298
We have a partner, remember?

29:24.331 --> 29:25.933
The reason we know what we know.

29:27.569 --> 29:28.435
The mule's girl?

29:29.970 --> 29:31.272
I know.

29:31.305 --> 29:33.508
It's time you two had
a little face to face.

29:35.909 --> 29:37.278
You, stay put.

29:39.813 --> 29:40.649
Not with him.

29:42.082 --> 29:43.817
Just you and me, that's it.

30:29.897 --> 30:30.765
Hey.

30:35.503 --> 30:36.904
Shut the fuck up!

30:38.305 --> 30:39.139
Shut up.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.677
The guys behind this shit,

30:42.711 --> 30:44.311
they must have paid her a visit.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.649
She was dead when I found her.

30:47.682 --> 30:49.383
I didn't want the cops
asking any questions

30:49.416 --> 30:50.819
that might derail this
motherfucker,

30:50.851 --> 30:52.554
so I stashed her here.

30:52.587 --> 30:53.387
You hear me?

30:55.022 --> 30:58.092
They know my name, and you.

31:02.162 --> 31:02.996
Okay?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.168
I take this away, you won't
scream?

31:09.504 --> 31:10.772
Get the fuck off me.

31:12.873 --> 31:13.874
I'm just trying to bring you

31:13.907 --> 31:15.275
into the cone of shit going down
here.

31:17.579 --> 31:19.113
So we all know the stakes.

31:31.693 --> 31:35.095
- One million.
- One million what?

31:35.129 --> 31:38.065
- That's my new cut.
- Blow me.

31:38.098 --> 31:40.134
I did, very underwhelming.

31:42.035 --> 31:44.405
You need me at a drop I
wanted nothing to do with.

31:44.438 --> 31:46.073
The crew we're ripping
off, leaving bodies behind,

31:46.106 --> 31:48.041
so I need one fucking million.

31:48.075 --> 31:50.244
That's the cost to get your 14.

31:50.277 --> 31:52.179
Plus a promise I don't
have to see your face again

31:52.212 --> 31:54.248
until the day of the auction.

31:54.281 --> 31:55.449
250, final offer.

31:57.084 --> 31:58.018
It's not gonna cut it, Craig.

31:58.051 --> 31:58.887
Come on.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.622
I'm not ending up like her.

32:00.655 --> 32:03.257
One million is a figure it takes
to get me out of this life,

32:03.290 --> 32:04.124
on my terms.

32:12.567 --> 32:13.601
All right.

32:41.328 --> 32:43.163
Thanks for meeting me.

32:43.197 --> 32:45.466
I don't usually meet clients
outside the courthouse.

32:45.499 --> 32:48.435
Professional, though some
judges might disagree.

32:51.004 --> 32:56.109
- You okay?
- The plan.

32:56.143 --> 33:00.648
When I got back, Craig said
something that has me freaked.

33:03.116 --> 33:04.853
Like?

33:04.886 --> 33:09.156
I think something happened
to the mule's girlfriend.

33:11.793 --> 33:14.929
Okay, you have to tell
Winston.

33:14.963 --> 33:15.763
Yeah, right.

33:15.797 --> 33:16.865
I'm being serious.

33:16.898 --> 33:19.132
It's the only way to protect
yourself.

33:19.166 --> 33:22.135
Assault, impersonating a
police officer, grand larceny.

33:22.169 --> 33:24.973
Craig Bayonne's illustrious
body of work goes on and on.

33:28.408 --> 33:30.812
- No charges of murder?
- Not yet.

33:34.716 --> 33:35.884
Anything else?

33:41.523 --> 33:44.391
In the tow pound, on the
wall in the waiting room,

33:44.424 --> 33:46.728
there's this picture of a
mountain,

33:46.761 --> 33:48.462
like Everest or something.

33:48.495 --> 33:50.364
Years ago, it must have been
put up to take the edge off.

33:50.397 --> 33:52.399
Like a plant you didn't have to
water.

33:53.902 --> 33:57.337
I asked the lady at window
five who has been there forever

33:57.371 --> 34:00.542
if she knew where it was
or who put it up or why?

34:01.543 --> 34:04.512
Not a clue, not a clue.

34:04.546 --> 34:06.046
She never even thought to ask.

34:08.550 --> 34:11.853
That's why I knew I had to
get the fuck out of there.

34:11.886 --> 34:16.089
And when I did, I'd find that
mountain.

34:16.123 --> 34:18.693
You know, most thieves pick a
beach,

34:18.726 --> 34:21.495
you know, nice views,
kayaking, all that stuff.

34:21.529 --> 34:26.233
- I'm not most thieves.
- Right.

34:27.869 --> 34:29.069
And I don't wanna live my life
looking

34:29.101 --> 34:30.370
at lost opportunities.

34:35.877 --> 34:36.710
I'm with you.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.081
It's crazy to think

34:42.382 --> 34:44.284
someone's gonna see 15 million
dollars,

34:45.319 --> 34:48.487
all in one room, all at once.

34:51.224 --> 34:53.061
Think of the lives that could
change.

34:59.399 --> 35:01.569
- Be right back.
- All right.

35:48.850 --> 35:50.317
Need a refill, hun?

35:50.350 --> 35:51.351
Thank you.

35:55.957 --> 35:58.960
- Little more?
- I got it.

36:03.998 --> 36:06.668
Should you get back to grinding
the gears of bureaucracy?

36:06.701 --> 36:08.268
Mm-hmm.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.806
- All you had to do-
- I know.

36:11.839 --> 36:12.640
I told you.

36:12.674 --> 36:14.408
Did I not tell you, Casi?

36:16.476 --> 36:18.345
You couldn't just shut up and do
your job?

36:18.378 --> 36:19.814
Selling mattresses is a job.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.214
Mmm, Lord.

36:21.248 --> 36:23.551
My guys, I gotta look out for
them.

36:23.584 --> 36:26.654
By making me do this
thing I don't wanna do?

36:26.688 --> 36:28.455
It's not about letting me down.

36:28.488 --> 36:31.626
Your clients, what about them?

36:31.659 --> 36:33.226
This is a bullshit
complaint and you know it.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.228
Then apologize to the
judge.

36:35.262 --> 36:36.130
To Cymbeline?

36:36.164 --> 36:37.197
Fuck that.

36:37.230 --> 36:38.900
I'd rather eat her fucking ankle
weights.

36:40.702 --> 36:41.936
Six months suspension.

36:44.204 --> 36:47.742
I don't think they'll disbar,
maybe.

36:55.449 --> 36:56.283
Casi.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.460
What are you gonna do?

37:08.062 --> 37:09.262
I hear Cuba's nice.

37:10.363 --> 37:11.264
And now you're just being an
asshole.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.499
What do you want me to say?

37:12.533 --> 37:13.735
This is what I do.

37:13.768 --> 37:15.570
Excuse me, for busting my ass,

37:15.603 --> 37:16.938
trying to level the playing
field.

37:16.971 --> 37:19.707
You can't fight everyone,
every step of the way.

37:20.742 --> 37:23.177
We're all on the same side.

37:23.211 --> 37:24.545
Maybe that's the problem.

37:34.387 --> 37:35.223
You were right.

37:36.090 --> 37:36.991
Of course I was.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.260
About what?

37:40.293 --> 37:41.929
The strong will always eat the
weak.

37:41.963 --> 37:44.132
No, however could that be.

37:47.135 --> 37:48.435
Tough week for you, champ?

37:49.670 --> 37:51.639
All right, come on,

37:51.672 --> 37:55.243
a night of heroic drinking
and revenge fantasies, on me.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.517
Who wants this job anyway?

38:06.087 --> 38:08.990
Bright side? At least now you
can see if wonder ears likes

38:09.023 --> 38:10.323
you for more than your docket.

38:12.093 --> 38:15.263
Lea Deleon used me, she lied.

38:15.295 --> 38:17.565
Stop the presses.

38:17.598 --> 38:19.100
- Bigfoots a fiction?
- Oh no, no,

38:19.133 --> 38:20.101
deal's going down all right.

38:20.134 --> 38:22.603
Just not the date she told vice.

38:29.777 --> 38:30.611
Huh.

38:32.345 --> 38:33.748
This is crazy.

38:33.781 --> 38:35.415
I don't know if you're
serious or just smoking crack.

38:35.448 --> 38:38.019
- I'm 100% both.
- Then obviously, no

38:38.052 --> 38:39.654
Don't be fucking so
close-minded.

38:39.687 --> 38:42.322
No, no, let me save you time.

38:42.355 --> 38:43.825
I will, under no circumstance,

38:43.858 --> 38:46.194
participate in an attempt
to steal millions of dollars

38:46.227 --> 38:50.164
in drug money Lea Deleon
has told the DA about, no.

38:50.198 --> 38:51.265
Why not?

38:51.299 --> 38:52.867
Because it's the definition of
fantasy.

38:52.900 --> 38:55.136
Hey, even if you acknowledged
that we,

38:55.169 --> 38:57.337
properly armed with the
pertinent facts,

38:57.370 --> 38:59.439
could devise a plan that would
enable us

38:59.472 --> 39:02.510
to steal said monies
without detection or harm?

39:03.845 --> 39:07.281
Listen, as long as the Golem
gets his cut

39:07.315 --> 39:08.983
and the buyers get their
product,

39:09.016 --> 39:11.118
the list of who we're
actually stealing from,

39:11.152 --> 39:12.553
is pretty fucking short and
sexy.

39:12.587 --> 39:13.955
Oh now you know.

39:13.988 --> 39:17.158
We know literally more
than anyone else involved.

39:17.191 --> 39:20.027
It's the perfect setup
for the perfect crime.

39:20.061 --> 39:21.896
Still needs to be perfectly
executed.

39:21.929 --> 39:23.164
You know, excuse me if I don't
think

39:23.197 --> 39:24.565
we're the men for that job.

39:25.398 --> 39:27.134
So it's fear of failure?

39:27.168 --> 39:29.203
- Amongst other things.
- Like?

39:29.237 --> 39:30.071
I don't wanna go to jail,

39:30.104 --> 39:31.572
and I don't wanna get shot.

39:31.606 --> 39:32.974
Both distinct probabilities.

39:33.007 --> 39:35.076
- What if we're caught?
- By who?

39:35.109 --> 39:36.978
I suppose by whose job
it is to catch criminals

39:37.011 --> 39:39.379
- who steal money.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

39:39.412 --> 39:40.815
We know these people.

39:40.848 --> 39:42.350
They couldn't catch a cold

39:42.382 --> 39:45.152
in a freezer wearing wet sponge
pajamas.

39:46.020 --> 39:46.821
Fuck off, buddy.

39:46.854 --> 39:47.588
Get outta here.

39:49.123 --> 39:52.360
Okay, let me pose this hypo.

39:52.392 --> 39:55.263
What if I was in a position
to guarantee success?

39:55.296 --> 39:56.496
Do you have a ring?

39:56.530 --> 39:57.365
That you could put on and
become invisible?

39:57.397 --> 39:58.933
'cause I love that, love that.

39:58.966 --> 39:59.934
That's the spirit.

39:59.967 --> 40:00.935
- What then?
- I still wouldn't do it.

40:00.968 --> 40:04.505
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong.

40:04.538 --> 40:06.007
- It's wrong?
- It's wrong.

40:06.040 --> 40:06.874
It's wrong?

40:07.775 --> 40:09.377
Casi!

40:09.409 --> 40:11.178
You can't ignore this, Casi.

40:11.212 --> 40:13.714
- Wake up to your disease.
- Go home.

40:13.748 --> 40:16.217
You're diseased as am I,

40:16.250 --> 40:17.785
as are the majority of the
schmucks

40:17.818 --> 40:19.120
who come herding through that
meat grinder

40:19.153 --> 40:21.222
- of so-called justice.
- What disease is that?

40:21.255 --> 40:22.757
Poverty is the medical term,

40:22.790 --> 40:24.926
- also known as slavery.
- Oh, slavery now.

40:24.959 --> 40:26.060
Yes, because in this world,

40:26.093 --> 40:27.361
you have money or money has you?

40:27.395 --> 40:30.298
And we both know what
category you fall into.

40:30.331 --> 40:33.401
- You're dying.
- I'm 26, bitch.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.468
It should serve as not
the slightest consolation

40:35.503 --> 40:38.306
that your disease is in a
temporary remission, okay?

40:38.339 --> 40:39.740
It's drug money, Dane.

40:39.774 --> 40:42.810
- Blood money.
- So what?

40:42.843 --> 40:45.112
Nobody cares where the money
comes from,

40:45.146 --> 40:46.647
just what it can do.

40:46.681 --> 40:48.049
Think about it Casi,

40:48.082 --> 40:50.651
I'm offering you a cure here.

40:50.685 --> 40:52.887
- What, to my disease?
- Yes.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.790
Look, I'm dying too, all right.

40:55.823 --> 40:57.658
And the worst part is not
knowing what you have.

40:57.692 --> 40:59.760
I don't know if it's brain
cancer,

40:59.794 --> 41:02.663
a gunshot or a fucking
Acme safe to the head.

41:02.697 --> 41:05.733
All I know for sure is it's
coming, okay?

41:05.766 --> 41:06.901
It's fucking coming.

41:06.934 --> 41:08.336
Then go climb Kilimanjaro or
something.

41:08.369 --> 41:09.770
Go find yourself-

41:09.804 --> 41:11.272
- Do I look like a
fucking dilettante to you?

41:11.305 --> 41:13.307
- No.
- This is it, man.

41:13.341 --> 41:15.076
This is our chance.

41:15.109 --> 41:18.279
Our chance to carve our
names across the back ass

41:18.312 --> 41:19.313
of the universe.

41:19.347 --> 41:22.083
Legacy time.

41:22.116 --> 41:26.120
Now, are we reaching in to this
wormhole

41:26.153 --> 41:28.089
that the universe has opened up
for us

41:28.122 --> 41:33.828
and pulling out 15 million
tax-free dollars or what, huh?

41:53.147 --> 41:55.850
- Oh, you been busy lately.
- Jesus.

41:57.218 --> 41:59.620
And I see some red lights
blinking.

41:59.653 --> 42:02.223
What the fuck are you talking
about?

42:02.256 --> 42:05.159
- Your friend.
- I have lots of them.

42:05.192 --> 42:07.028
Well, this one's a public
defender,

42:09.063 --> 42:09.930
and your defender.

42:16.170 --> 42:20.207
- He was worried about me.
- What do you mean?

42:20.241 --> 42:22.309
After you dragged me with
the sample to the Golem,

42:22.343 --> 42:23.512
I got tossed by NYPD

42:23.544 --> 42:24.979
- on my way home.
- The fuck?

42:25.012 --> 42:27.081
With my priors, I had no
choice but to cooperate.

42:27.114 --> 42:28.716
- Look, I told them everything.
- The fuck!

42:28.749 --> 42:31.052
- But the dates.
- You fucked me.

42:31.085 --> 42:32.219
Are you listening to me?

42:32.253 --> 42:33.020
I'm gonna do you like the
other girl.

42:33.054 --> 42:34.321
I lied to them.

42:34.355 --> 42:36.057
- They think it's next week.
- I don't wanna do.

42:36.090 --> 42:38.359
What did you say?

42:38.392 --> 42:43.697
- What did you say?
- Hey, what did you,

42:43.731 --> 42:45.366
what did you say?

42:45.399 --> 42:47.168
That you gave them a head fake?

42:47.201 --> 42:47.935
You killed her?

42:53.407 --> 42:54.842
Jesus, I knew it,

42:54.875 --> 42:56.310
I knew you were a psycho.

42:58.813 --> 42:59.647
No.

43:02.083 --> 43:03.784
Well, I handled my side of
things,

43:05.719 --> 43:06.787
and you handled yours.

43:35.116 --> 43:36.217
Whoa.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.318
You should see the
other guy.

43:37.351 --> 43:40.087
- Dale.
- Something like that.

43:41.288 --> 43:42.591
What's up?

43:42.656 --> 43:45.192
I'm liminal down there on a
new proof.

43:48.829 --> 43:50.364
See if you can help a guy out.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.736
Batteries, candles, canned
gazpacho.

43:55.769 --> 43:59.240
This is quite an apocalypse-y
list you have here.

43:59.273 --> 44:01.775
Does it have something to do
with that ripple of yours?

44:02.810 --> 44:04.445
Let's just say that I hope you
know

44:04.478 --> 44:06.213
how to use that thing.

44:10.284 --> 44:11.685
I took fencing junior year.

44:13.988 --> 44:14.889
It was pass, fail.

44:17.358 --> 44:18.192
I passed.

44:20.961 --> 44:24.533
- Just get this stuff.
- I will.

44:26.000 --> 44:26.834
Mm-hmm.

44:43.552 --> 44:44.553
Hello?

44:44.586 --> 44:46.655
Golden boy, bad
time?

44:46.687 --> 44:47.656
How'd you get my number?

44:47.688 --> 44:49.658
'Cause I'm a fucking
detective.

44:49.723 --> 44:51.158
Heard you spoke to my informant.

44:51.192 --> 44:52.693
Anything I should know?

44:52.726 --> 44:53.562
Beyond the continued existence

44:53.595 --> 44:55.896
of client attorney privilege?

44:55.930 --> 44:57.632
You are no longer her lawyer.

44:57.666 --> 45:00.034
First of all, I'm sorry, what a
shock!

45:00.067 --> 45:01.135
Neither of those things are
true.

45:01.168 --> 45:03.572
Second, remember you vouched for
her.

45:03.605 --> 45:06.040
Any part of that story
turns out to be bullshit.

45:06.073 --> 45:07.875
Or that little lady of
yours does something stupid,

45:07.908 --> 45:11.045
and that dope ends up on
the street, it is on you.

45:11.078 --> 45:14.649
You'll be responsible for any
of the damage that she does.

45:14.683 --> 45:16.016
You got it?

45:16.050 --> 45:17.418
Now, get the fuck off my phone.

46:28.188 --> 46:29.557
36th Street.

46:29.591 --> 46:30.424
36th Street.

46:30.457 --> 46:32.694
Step aside and let 'em off.

46:34.629 --> 46:36.263
Attention, passengers.

46:36.297 --> 46:38.600
This line is no longer in
service.

46:38.633 --> 46:40.669
Due to a city-wide power outage,

46:40.702 --> 46:42.771
this line is no longer in
service.

46:42.803 --> 46:47.474
Please move safely and
swiftly to the nearest exit.

46:47.509 --> 46:48.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:51.211 --> 46:53.147
- This your stop?
- No.

46:54.549 --> 46:56.618
Safely and swiftly,
ladies and gentlemen.

46:56.651 --> 46:57.752
It's a power outage.

46:57.786 --> 46:59.621
Line's out of service.

47:04.693 --> 47:06.160
No one likes to admit it,

47:06.193 --> 47:09.129
but people love the danger
of nights like this.

47:10.799 --> 47:11.832
People or you?

47:16.571 --> 47:17.404
Five bucks?

47:27.414 --> 47:28.817
How do I look?

47:28.849 --> 47:30.884
All we need is a baseball
bat and a grocery cart,

47:30.918 --> 47:32.587
and we can go shopping right
now.

47:35.055 --> 47:35.889
This is me.

47:37.592 --> 47:38.425
Okay.

47:41.495 --> 47:44.031
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, shoot.

47:46.166 --> 47:47.501
What do you get out of it?

47:50.337 --> 47:51.171
What?

47:52.439 --> 47:54.709
Defending people like me.

47:56.678 --> 47:59.581
Ah, I mean there's so much.

47:59.614 --> 48:00.414
The shit pay.

48:00.447 --> 48:02.883
The professional disrespect.

48:02.916 --> 48:05.486
In all honesty, I have a
masochistic side that believes

48:05.520 --> 48:08.623
everyone deserves a
second chance, even you.

48:10.924 --> 48:13.494
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:13.528 --> 48:14.361
Great.

48:15.530 --> 48:16.363
Well, thank you.

48:21.435 --> 48:22.269
Night.

48:24.572 --> 48:26.574
What, you're not coming?

48:36.316 --> 48:38.952
There's some candles in the
kitchen, under the sink.

48:38.986 --> 48:39.821
Okay.

49:36.376 --> 49:38.780
How'd you get that?

49:38.813 --> 49:40.314
Looks like a burn.

49:42.684 --> 49:44.117
Pot of water on the oven.

49:46.554 --> 49:47.956
I used to get nosebleeds.

49:49.223 --> 49:50.123
It's embarrassing.

49:51.693 --> 49:52.794
Like a humidifier.

49:54.461 --> 49:56.564
Foster family I lived
with used to do that.

49:59.199 --> 50:00.300
Must've hurt.

50:02.637 --> 50:04.973
Not as much as seeing
my mother get dragged away

50:05.005 --> 50:07.341
and sent back to Columbia
for putting it there.

50:09.644 --> 50:10.512
I'm sorry.

50:17.886 --> 50:22.590
That mountain, at the tow
pound,

50:26.059 --> 50:27.094
it's not real, is it?

50:36.370 --> 50:39.172
I know you lied to them, the
cops.

50:40.608 --> 50:42.342
I know the auction's on
Saturday.

50:42.376 --> 50:44.278
It's not Wednesday like you
testified.

50:46.213 --> 50:48.983
Lea, look, what I don't
understand is

50:49.017 --> 50:50.752
how you can think you can play
all sides

50:50.785 --> 50:52.219
without getting hurt.

50:52.252 --> 50:53.922
I don't care how smart you are.

50:53.955 --> 50:56.189
Since when do lawyers
stalk their clients?

50:56.223 --> 50:58.091
You're way in over your head.

51:00.929 --> 51:04.699
Go back to Winston, and
just say the dates changed.

51:06.734 --> 51:08.536
No.

51:08.570 --> 51:11.039
You're a part of this, aren't
you?

51:11.071 --> 51:12.439
The exchange.

51:12.472 --> 51:13.608
You told me to protect myself.

51:13.641 --> 51:14.709
I'm doing the best I can.

51:14.742 --> 51:16.209
But you know

51:16.243 --> 51:18.546
what will happen the second
Craig gets his cash, right?

51:18.580 --> 51:19.413
You know.

51:22.482 --> 51:23.785
Come clean on this.

51:25.419 --> 51:26.888
And then what?

51:26.921 --> 51:29.757
Go back to a dead end job and
blow my boss for a pension

51:29.791 --> 51:30.892
that'll never pay off?

51:32.092 --> 51:34.028
Maybe I just quit.

51:34.062 --> 51:35.964
Let a whole new crop of
people sit in judgment

51:35.997 --> 51:37.832
of my criminal record and reject
me?

51:39.099 --> 51:39.934
Fuck that.

51:41.669 --> 51:46.574
If I am what everyone
already thinks I am, then

51:46.608 --> 51:47.775
excuse me

51:47.809 --> 51:48.810
if I'm just thinking
the only future I have

51:48.843 --> 51:50.277
is one I take for myself.

51:52.981 --> 51:55.315
I tell Winston if you won't.

51:55.349 --> 51:58.151
I don't think you will.

51:58.185 --> 52:00.287
How do you know?

52:01.623 --> 52:03.958
Because you don't think
I deserve any of this.

52:06.126 --> 52:08.295
And you wouldn't be
here if you didn't care.

52:10.163 --> 52:11.331
Just help me, Casi.

52:20.842 --> 52:22.175
Sorry.

52:28.315 --> 52:29.517
Hey, that's my wallet.

52:30.852 --> 52:31.786
Yeah, so it is.

52:34.789 --> 52:36.624
Hey, Casi, huh?

52:36.658 --> 52:38.860
Hey, you know who I am,
Mr. Public Defender?

52:40.695 --> 52:41.529
Huh?

52:46.701 --> 52:47.501
No?

52:47.535 --> 52:49.436
I know you,

52:49.469 --> 52:51.204
you better not be trying to
get in the middle of something

52:51.238 --> 52:53.440
that has nothing to do with you.

52:53.473 --> 52:55.175
For her sake.

52:55.208 --> 52:56.010
- No.
- No?

54:01.308 --> 54:02.944
You realize it's
not a fencing sword, right?

54:05.813 --> 54:07.247
Yeah, client gift.

54:08.482 --> 54:10.618
My first trial victory.

54:10.651 --> 54:13.521
The samurai used it to
protect the innocent.

54:13.554 --> 54:15.288
Now, I use it as a wall
decoration.

54:18.126 --> 54:19.093
What am I doing?

54:22.096 --> 54:23.898
It's six am, you tell me.

54:25.666 --> 54:26.934
The time and temperature sign

54:26.968 --> 54:29.269
on the building outside
the courthouse this week.

54:29.302 --> 54:31.639
You know what the temperature
was?

54:31.672 --> 54:34.809
- Hot.
- 150 degrees.

54:37.477 --> 54:40.181
And how am I the only person
who noticed this is broken?

54:41.983 --> 54:44.819
Maybe it's not the clock
that's broken.

54:44.852 --> 54:48.222
You're familiar, I'm
sure, with singularities.

54:48.256 --> 54:51.324
And not the man merges
with computer singularity

54:51.358 --> 54:54.629
as rehearsed by Kurzweil
and other futurists, but,

55:00.601 --> 55:04.005
but singularity involving
the laws of physics.

55:05.338 --> 55:07.942
Yes, somehow my law school
missed that.

55:09.110 --> 55:09.944
Okay.

55:11.646 --> 55:13.413
Picture a star turning into a
black hole

55:13.446 --> 55:15.448
which happens from time to time.

55:16.517 --> 55:18.318
It starts to shrink,

55:18.351 --> 55:21.923
the pull of gravity
accelerating until nothing,

55:21.956 --> 55:24.391
not even light can escape.

55:25.660 --> 55:28.196
And what is at the
center of that black hole

55:28.229 --> 55:29.697
into which we can't see?

55:30.965 --> 55:32.066
A singularity.

55:34.401 --> 55:35.903
Give that man a steak.

55:37.337 --> 55:40.541
The universe is collapsing.

55:40.575 --> 55:45.012
Suddenly, and all around
us, too much matter.

55:46.214 --> 55:47.715
And you're seeing signs of it.

55:48.916 --> 55:50.618
Right.

55:50.651 --> 55:52.520
That isn't the first spliff
you've had tonight, is it?

55:52.553 --> 55:55.723
I'm telling you, things
that used to have no mass,

55:55.756 --> 55:58.159
now, suddenly do.

55:58.192 --> 56:00.695
Like punishments that don't fit
the crime.

56:05.933 --> 56:07.101
Laws, Casi.

56:08.736 --> 56:10.838
People like to think they're
fixed,

56:10.872 --> 56:14.308
be it in physics or that
courthouse of yours.

56:14.342 --> 56:17.879
It comforts them to know
what props up their world.

56:17.912 --> 56:21.182
Especially, when they see it
falling apart, all around them.

56:23.217 --> 56:24.518
Like you, my friend.

56:27.454 --> 56:30.191
And whatever it is, it's
scaring you, don't let it.

56:36.230 --> 56:38.666
One can break the law, my
friend,

56:38.699 --> 56:40.101
and still believe in justice.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.055
Okay, I'm in.

57:02.657 --> 57:03.524
In what?

57:04.959 --> 57:07.460
You know, that brainstorm of
yours.

57:07.494 --> 57:10.865
I'm a man of many storms of
the brain.

57:10.898 --> 57:12.733
It's like fucking Jupiter in
here.

57:12.767 --> 57:13.868
Which one again?

57:13.901 --> 57:15.403
You're fucking with me, right?

57:17.138 --> 57:18.039
Ah.

57:18.072 --> 57:19.540
You know what, forget it.

57:19.573 --> 57:20.374
This was a mistake.

57:20.408 --> 57:21.776
You're an asshole.

57:21.809 --> 57:23.044
All right, all right.

57:23.077 --> 57:24.211
All right, all right.

57:24.245 --> 57:25.079
I'm an asshole.

57:29.417 --> 57:30.952
So what's the plan, huh?

57:32.086 --> 57:33.220
We sneak into the tow
pound,

57:33.254 --> 57:35.890
replace the NYPD trackers with
our own.

57:35.923 --> 57:37.291
And follow Lea to the Golem.

57:39.527 --> 57:42.997
She doesn't know yet,
but she'll get her cut.

57:43.030 --> 57:43.864
Asshole.

57:46.834 --> 57:48.769
And we'll make sure
those drugs never end up

57:48.803 --> 57:49.637
on the street.

58:14.662 --> 58:15.495
Hey.

58:39.854 --> 58:40.688
Hey.

58:43.858 --> 58:45.226
Eagle two taking flight.

58:50.164 --> 58:51.198
Eagle one landed yet?

58:55.236 --> 58:56.537
Eagle two getting worried.

59:00.174 --> 59:01.308
Eagle's in his nest.

59:01.342 --> 59:02.443
Shut the fuck up, Dane.

59:05.046 --> 59:06.213
Okay, first
vehicle

59:06.247 --> 59:09.216
on the block is a 2006 Honda
civic.

59:09.250 --> 59:11.419
Fair condition, but bidder
beware,

59:11.452 --> 59:14.155
the bloodstains might not
be able to come out, okay?

59:14.188 --> 59:15.356
We'll start at 15.

59:39.046 --> 59:40.515
Hey, you're the guys from
Narcotics?

59:40.549 --> 59:42.116
Yeah.

59:42.149 --> 59:43.884
She's been missing since last
Friday.

59:43.918 --> 59:45.786
- Boyfriend?
- Big time weirdo,

59:45.820 --> 59:47.588
small time dealer.

59:47.621 --> 59:50.091
Thought you guys might
know him, Craig Bayonne.

01:00:02.336 --> 01:00:04.972
You still thinking about my
offer?

01:00:05.005 --> 01:00:05.840
Every night.

01:00:08.577 --> 01:00:10.978
Do I hear 2,750 anyone?

01:00:11.011 --> 01:00:13.914
2750, all right,

01:00:13.948 --> 01:00:15.616
I see someone in the back.

01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:16.917
Can we go higher?

01:00:16.951 --> 01:00:17.751
What about three?

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:19.954
Three, anyone three, huh?

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.056
No, all right.

01:00:22.089 --> 01:00:24.925
Going once, going twice, 2,750
sold

01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:27.795
to my man over there
with the hat, all right.

01:00:27.828 --> 01:00:28.629
Next.

01:00:42.611 --> 01:00:43.444
Next.

01:00:46.714 --> 01:00:47.516
Excuse me.

01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:49.183
Help, my car was towed.

01:00:49.216 --> 01:00:52.019
It's on the wall there,
in 96 different languages.

01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:53.287
It's kind of pointless

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.523
if you guys don't speak
every one of the 96.

01:00:54.556 --> 01:00:55.956
License and registration.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.159
It's a rental, the
contract's in the car.

01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:04.665
Not an easy task for you in
this little glass box of yours.

01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:06.467
Must feel like a prison in
there.

01:01:07.636 --> 01:01:09.670
Not that you've ever been to
prison.

01:01:10.572 --> 01:01:12.973
- Do I know you?
- No, I doubt it.

01:01:13.007 --> 01:01:14.643
I have that kind of face.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.179
Resting asshole face.

01:01:18.212 --> 01:01:19.213
Bring that around the corner,

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:20.314
and bring the paperwork back to
me

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:21.315
and we'll get you processed.

01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.350
Ooh, I love getting processed.

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:48.876
I don't know.

01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:50.044
Sure as shit something though.

01:01:52.179 --> 01:01:53.013
Shit.

01:01:55.115 --> 01:01:56.116
- Tow pound?
- Yup.

01:01:57.918 --> 01:02:01.656
Next, we have a 2015 Lincoln
Navigator.

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:03.558
Black, excellent condition.

01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:05.359
We're gonna start the bidding at
15.

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:06.727
Can I get 15?

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.663
Right up front for my decisive
gentleman,

01:02:08.697 --> 01:02:10.331
15 right off the bat.

01:02:10.364 --> 01:02:11.198
All right.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.669
Here she is.

01:02:14.703 --> 01:02:15.537
Oooh, yo.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.815
Can I get 16?

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:30.851
16 from the gents in the back.

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:32.953
- Do I hear-
- 17 grand.

01:02:32.987 --> 01:02:34.623
Sir, you need to hold your
paddle up.

01:02:34.656 --> 01:02:36.023
Your paddle up, sir.

01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:42.697
18 from the back.

01:02:42.731 --> 01:02:44.231
Can we get 19?

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:46.900
19 from my friend upfront.

01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:50.304
- 25.
- 25,000, all right.

01:02:50.337 --> 01:02:51.573
Can we go higher?

01:02:51.606 --> 01:02:53.073
Can we get 26?

01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:57.311
26, anybody?

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:59.079
40 fucking grand.

01:02:59.113 --> 01:03:00.881
Sir, you understand-

01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:02.717
- Come on, just say it, all
right?

01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:04.918
Going once, going twice, sold.

01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:08.088
Okay, $40,000, going once,
going twice.

01:03:08.122 --> 01:03:08.989
60,000.

01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:19.133
Ah, thoroughly processed.

01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:24.238
- Let me guess, Sagittarius.
- Seriously?

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:27.107
What, you don't believe in
the great astrological arts?

01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:29.076
Only what they tell
me about guys like you.

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:31.845
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- Run.

01:03:40.854 --> 01:03:41.690
Okay.

01:03:43.658 --> 01:03:45.993
If we're gonna do this,
let me just warn you,

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:48.028
I will dedicate myself almost
exclusively

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:50.799
to achieve the removal
of one of your eyeballs.

01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:52.099
Now, this will be done
without consideration

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:55.436
of my own safety or the
result of this combat.

01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:57.404
Are you willing to live with
that, sir?

01:04:03.977 --> 01:04:06.347
Hey, what are you doing in
here?

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:14.121
I thought we were keeping a
low profile.

01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:15.724
- I know they're here.
- Who?

01:04:15.757 --> 01:04:18.158
The guys whose stuff
we're trying to shanghai.

01:04:18.992 --> 01:04:20.894
Right fucking outside now.

01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:22.697
Please, don't tell me they
outbid you.

01:04:22.731 --> 01:04:25.165
Who knew I needed to
roll with 60 fuckin' Gs?

01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:29.002
Give me your driver's license.

01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:30.304
Huh?

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:31.271
You heard me, give me
your driver's license.

01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:38.178
Take this, and wait in the
room around the corner.

01:04:38.212 --> 01:04:39.748
What are you gonna do?

01:04:39.781 --> 01:04:41.181
Earn my million.

01:04:47.121 --> 01:04:48.122
Thank you.

01:04:56.598 --> 01:04:58.265
Anyone else here from the
auction?

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:03.772
Can I have your license
please, Mr-

01:05:03.805 --> 01:05:04.639
- Ballena.

01:05:12.112 --> 01:05:13.080
Sorry, it doesn't look like-

01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:14.849
- It's here.
- Don't worry, I'm sure.

01:05:14.883 --> 01:05:16.116
This happens all the time.

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:19.621
Let me just check with my guys
in the lot.

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:48.008
Eagle One, what the
fuck happened to you?

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:50.210
Remember when I said
the strong eats the weak?

01:06:50.244 --> 01:06:51.946
I just ran into the thing
that eats everything.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:52.847
I have no idea what that
means.

01:06:52.881 --> 01:06:54.214
All right, it doesn't matter.

01:06:54.248 --> 01:06:55.617
It's over, they know.

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.518
The Mexican cartel?

01:06:56.551 --> 01:06:57.384
Fucking Lea and Bayonne.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.920
And that big whale, he has...

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:03.791
Dane, what Mexican cartel?

01:07:03.825 --> 01:07:05.425
The dudes who lost the heroin.

01:07:07.094 --> 01:07:08.796
And they won the auction, I
think.

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.731
- Goddamn.
- Guess they weren't

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:11.131
as in the dark as we thought.

01:07:11.164 --> 01:07:12.867
Are you fucking kidding?

01:07:12.901 --> 01:07:15.737
- I'm done, I'm done.
- Take a deep breath.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.238
Casi, Casi, hey, hey, hey
we can still salvage this.

01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:19.541
This we're not prepared for.

01:07:19.574 --> 01:07:20.742
The last time I fucking bled
like this,

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.677
- I had a paper cut.
- And you gutted it out.

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:23.678
Fuck you, Dane.

01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:24.879
- Fuck you.
- Okay, just breathe.

01:07:24.913 --> 01:07:25.914
Take a deep breath.

01:07:25.947 --> 01:07:26.915
Maybe not through your nose.

01:07:26.948 --> 01:07:28.348
Take a breath, okay?

01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:35.723
Okay, looks good.

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:36.591
Thanks.

01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:45.399
Can I help you?

01:07:46.768 --> 01:07:48.335
Yes.

01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:52.406
Oh fuck, here he comes.

01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:53.273
Fuck.

01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:02.584
No no no no.

01:08:02.617 --> 01:08:05.085
Start the car, start the car.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.895
Start the car!

01:08:13.928 --> 01:08:15.462
Goddammit, I lost my
car!

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:39.152
You, that Navigator better
still fucking be here.

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:51.966
They're close.

01:08:53.001 --> 01:08:55.603
Shit, I think they pulled over.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.979
I thought you said no one
carries.

01:09:06.014 --> 01:09:07.314
Yeah, guns.

01:09:07.346 --> 01:09:08.616
This here is 10,000 volts

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.652
of grade A certified reptoid
repellent.

01:09:13.554 --> 01:09:15.089
Don't fuck this up for me,
Craig.

01:09:15.122 --> 01:09:18.026
You realize we can call
this thing off, right?

01:09:18.059 --> 01:09:19.326
That's still an option.

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:20.160
An option?

01:09:20.193 --> 01:09:21.962
What are you, David Lewis?

01:09:21.996 --> 01:09:23.930
Professor, formerly of
Princeton,

01:09:23.965 --> 01:09:26.801
and recently admitted into
the great nothing, philosophy,

01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:28.636
- know him?
- David Lewis, okay, sure.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:29.703
Didn't think so.

01:09:29.737 --> 01:09:31.203
But surely, you know Leibniz,
right?

01:09:31.238 --> 01:09:33.541
And his concept of many possible
worlds

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:35.143
as alluded to in Voltaire's
"Candide."

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:36.343
And Dane, I know Lewis too.

01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:37.477
What's your point?

01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:38.680
My point is,

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:41.448
if we accept his form of
modal realism as true,

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.216
and we agree that we could
just walk away from our plan,

01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:45.819
then we must acknowledge

01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:48.622
that there is a world out there
where you and I do pussy out

01:09:48.656 --> 01:09:49.524
and go home.

01:09:49.557 --> 01:09:50.792
But that means-

01:09:50.825 --> 01:09:52.093
- There's world where we don't.

01:09:52.926 --> 01:09:53.761
Okay.

01:09:56.698 --> 01:09:57.532
Oh shit.

01:10:41.642 --> 01:10:42.476
All right.

01:10:43.778 --> 01:10:46.047
Are we doing this or what?

01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:03.097
I mean, it's kind of annoying

01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:04.632
to think there's someone
out there that looks like me

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:06.266
who goes around calling himself
Casi, who comes this close

01:11:06.299 --> 01:11:09.036
to achieving the perfect
heist, then bails.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:10.872
All right, fuck that guy.

01:11:10.905 --> 01:11:13.440
I mean, even if there's only
one of all possible worlds

01:11:13.473 --> 01:11:16.944
in which we succeed,
shouldn't that we be us?

01:11:24.519 --> 01:11:26.521
Leave the key and the opener
in the car.

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:51.979
All right.

01:11:57.118 --> 01:11:58.318
What is that?

01:11:58.351 --> 01:12:00.855
- What is what?
- That.

01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:01.956
I thought we said no guns.

01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:03.490
This, it's not a gun.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:05.293
Oh, it looks like a fuck ton
of gun.

01:12:05.358 --> 01:12:07.528
You told me to get tear gas.

01:12:07.562 --> 01:12:09.263
Yeah, like canisters, so we
can roll.

01:12:09.297 --> 01:12:11.199
We're taking out literally
one guy, not Falluja.

01:12:11.232 --> 01:12:13.768
It's exactly the same effect,

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.368
plus it looks badass as shit.

01:12:15.402 --> 01:12:16.436
- Dane-
- Appearances matter.

01:12:16.469 --> 01:12:19.040
- We are not using this.
- We are.

01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:19.874
We are.

01:12:19.907 --> 01:12:21.341
Look in my eyes.

01:12:21.374 --> 01:12:24.411
Look in my plastic eyes.

01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:27.380
Colin fucking Powell.

01:12:27.414 --> 01:12:28.850
Colin Powell what?

01:12:28.883 --> 01:12:32.352
Clear objective, overwhelming
force, exit strategy.

01:12:32.385 --> 01:12:36.624
You brought two of the three,
I completed the trinity.

01:12:36.657 --> 01:12:38.059
Now, if you have another way

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:43.130
to neutralize our wildcard
lizard worshiper, I am all ears.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:07.688
Okay, we're good then.

01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:16.297
Wait here.

01:13:34.048 --> 01:13:36.449
We're all good to go.

01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.831
Okay, this should
lead them right to it.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.604
- Someone spot it?
- Even Better

01:13:57.805 --> 01:14:00.908
It looks like Lea Deleon
had a change of heart.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.825
Craig, I'm pretty sure they
counted it.

01:14:17.858 --> 01:14:19.927
Like I trust the guy
dressed like a vampire

01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:22.763
on the hottest day of the year.

01:14:22.797 --> 01:14:24.265
No offense.

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:25.533
When we leave, you can go.

01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:28.035
Yeah.

01:14:43.684 --> 01:14:46.988
- Give me the keys.
- I can drive.

01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:48.622
The fuck you will.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:03.871
See what the fuck is going on.

01:15:17.718 --> 01:15:18.819
- Keys.
- Craig.

01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:20.054
- Now!
- Craig.

01:15:21.555 --> 01:15:23.457
Come on.

01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:38.973
Fuck it.

01:15:39.006 --> 01:15:40.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:40.775 --> 01:15:42.209
- What are you doing?
- We're going in.

01:15:42.243 --> 01:15:43.744
Wait a minute.

01:15:43.778 --> 01:15:45.880
Two minutes ago, and you wanted
to abandon ship, remember?

01:15:45.913 --> 01:15:48.517
Just because it's taking a
little longer than expected,

01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:51.352
now you wanna fucking storm the
beaches.

01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:53.020
You said it yourself.

01:15:53.054 --> 01:15:54.355
Colin fucking Powell.

01:15:56.123 --> 01:15:57.425
Fuck yeah.

01:16:26.987 --> 01:16:27.955
Fuck you, bitch.

01:16:27.988 --> 01:16:31.692
Where do you think you're going,
huh?

01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:37.765
- Now, freeze motherfuckers!
- Yes!

01:17:33.487 --> 01:17:34.321
No, don't puke.

01:17:34.355 --> 01:17:36.357
DNA, DNA is the evidence.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.292
- Is he dead?
- He's dead.

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:39.160
Go.

01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:43.831
You boys have no reason to
hold me.

01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:45.332
Well, we are,

01:17:45.366 --> 01:17:48.369
until you tell us why you bought
that Navigator for $60,000.

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:49.937
Sight unseen.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.005
We're almost to it.

01:17:58.412 --> 01:17:59.813
Get off of her right now.

01:18:04.752 --> 01:18:06.854
Damn if you don't bring
the idea of public defender

01:18:06.887 --> 01:18:08.122
to a whole new level.

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:09.423
I would do what he says.

01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:13.460
I said, get up!

01:18:13.494 --> 01:18:14.828
I swear to God.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:15.896
Now, get the fuck up.

01:18:20.701 --> 01:18:21.536
Help her.

01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:29.243
- Okay, I got you.
- Thanks.

01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:37.586
You know how I knew
we were being overrun?

01:18:38.919 --> 01:18:41.989
Lady Justice, it's like
a CT scan of everything

01:18:42.022 --> 01:18:43.357
that's wrong with America.

01:18:44.858 --> 01:18:46.695
One set of laws for the slaves,

01:18:48.963 --> 01:18:50.431
one for the slavers.

01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:03.110
You've seen it,

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:05.980
haven't you?

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.114
There it is.

01:21:24.519 --> 01:21:25.687
You know, I kinda feel sorry

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.722
for the other Casi and
Dane who didn't make it.

01:21:29.691 --> 01:21:30.525
Fuck 'em.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.395
Fuck 'em.

01:22:01.155 --> 01:22:02.590
You're welcome.

01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:21.643
I guess I chose well.

01:22:23.177 --> 01:22:24.011
Just not me.

01:22:44.532 --> 01:22:45.999
Thanks for second chance.

01:22:55.342 --> 01:22:58.847
Hey, make it count.

01:23:00.682 --> 01:23:02.517
You too.

01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:54.301
I'd say I'm surprised
to see you back here,

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:57.805
but it's too late in the
day for me to fake it.

01:23:57.839 --> 01:23:58.640
Go ahead.

01:23:58.673 --> 01:24:00.207
Tell me your tale of woe.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.209
My client pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

01:24:02.242 --> 01:24:04.846
Mr. Gartrell is an honor
student at Bronx Science,

01:24:04.879 --> 01:24:08.248
a good kid, and sitting on
his stoop before sundown

01:24:08.282 --> 01:24:09.751
is not a good enough reason

01:24:09.784 --> 01:24:12.419
for an arresting officer to
fracture his orbital socket.

01:24:12.452 --> 01:24:14.689
The defendant resisted
arrest, Your honor-

01:24:14.722 --> 01:24:16.658
- It's not illegal to ask a
police officer

01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:18.560
why he's demanding your ID.

01:24:18.593 --> 01:24:20.227
I left the copy of my
Fourth Amendment home,

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.897
but you should take my word for
it.

01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:25.533
There's the 220 marijuana
possession.

01:24:25.567 --> 01:24:29.169
A civil violation that
deserves a fine, rightly so,

01:24:29.202 --> 01:24:32.540
but it was also discovered
after he was beaten.

01:24:34.107 --> 01:24:36.176
My office will be filing a
wrongful imprisonment suit

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:37.779
against the city at the very
least.

01:24:37.812 --> 01:24:40.582
Are the other attorneys in
your little firm like you?

01:24:42.784 --> 01:24:46.420
It's just me at the
moment, but I'm hiring.

01:24:46.453 --> 01:24:47.387
If you know anyone.

01:24:49.222 --> 01:24:52.827
Mr. Gartrell, I'm gonna
ask you this one more time.

01:24:53.895 --> 01:24:56.463
Your lawyer, recently
reinstated,

01:24:56.496 --> 01:25:00.233
perhaps suffering some
residual enmity at this bench

01:25:00.267 --> 01:25:04.072
for his much deserved and long
vacation.

01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:07.041
And yet, still shouting into the
wind,

01:25:07.075 --> 01:25:09.142
is taking your case to trial.

01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:13.548
If that doesn't fill you
with complete confidence,

01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:16.784
now is your chance to
speak on your behalf.

01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:23.958
Like he said, not guilty.

01:25:27.662 --> 01:25:30.330
- People.
- People request $25,000 bail

01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:32.299
and electronic monitoring.

01:25:32.332 --> 01:25:34.401
I can't, how am I gonna pay
that bail?

01:25:34.434 --> 01:25:35.670
What'd I tell you?

01:25:37.437 --> 01:25:39.172
That legal fund you were
talking about?

01:25:39.206 --> 01:25:40.775
Yeah.

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:42.309
Bail's fine, Your Honor.

01:25:42.342 --> 01:25:43.176
I got you.

01:25:44.277 --> 01:25:46.179
Court sets the bail at 25,000,

01:25:46.213 --> 01:25:49.017
plus electronic monitoring
and house arrest.

01:25:50.183 --> 01:25:51.019
Couldn't be this easy.

01:25:51.052 --> 01:25:52.553
It must be a dream, Counselor.

01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:57.892
Just the best of all
possible worlds, Your Honor.

01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:02.864
Next docket

01:26:02.897 --> 01:26:05.566
343, People
versus Antonio Guiterriez.

01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:08.368
What happens now?

01:26:10.138 --> 01:26:12.239
We go to trial and we win.
