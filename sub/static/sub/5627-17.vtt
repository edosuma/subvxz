00:07.620 --> 00:09.880
Previously on Criminal Minds.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.080
Woman, you are driving me
crazy, you know that?

00:13.540 --> 00:15.080
Derek

00:15.080 --> 00:16.250
I don't know.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.040
Derek! Derek, talk to me.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.830
Derek!

00:20.290 --> 00:22.830
Savannah, call Hotch. Call Hotch!
Call Hotch!

00:22.830 --> 00:24.250
Are you there

00:25.290 --> 00:26.790
We did just take down a network
of online hitmen,

00:26.790 --> 00:28.210
but is this is blowback, why Morgan?

00:28.460 --> 00:29.540
Time to die.

00:30.540 --> 00:31.620
Not yet.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.830
Hey.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.380
So next time you ask,

00:47.210 --> 00:49.460
I will not be late for you.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.120
Or our son.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.880
But I don't know if it's a boy.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.000
It could be a girl.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.790
Will you marry me?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.170
Yes.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.290
6 MONTHS LATER

02:30.710 --> 02:34.000
NEAR WICHITA, KANSAS

03:31.080 --> 03:32.330
Mummy!

03:32.330 --> 03:33.460
Mummy, help!

03:33.920 --> 03:35.460
-Mummy, help me!
-

03:35.460 --> 03:37.250
Ronnie? Ronnie!

03:37.250 --> 03:38.620
Mummy! Mummy!
-I can't see.

03:38.620 --> 03:41.120
Jim, wake up! Wake up!

03:41.120 --> 03:42.380
Jim!

03:44.080 --> 03:45.420
Help, Mummy! Help!

03:45.420 --> 03:46.670
Ronnie!

03:46.670 --> 03:47.790
- -Ronnie!

03:47.790 --> 03:48.960
Ronnie, where are you?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.540
Ronnie, where are you?

03:52.330 --> 03:54.080
Help, Mummy! Help!

03:54.080 --> 03:56.210
Ronnie, where are you?

03:56.210 --> 03:57.710
- -

03:59.540 --> 04:01.380
I can't see!

04:01.620 --> 04:04.330
No, no! No!

04:09.670 --> 04:12.120
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. There you are.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.290
How are you settling in?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.120
Oh, you know. Like riding a bike.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.790
Yeah, you know,
I've been meaning to ask,

04:18.790 --> 04:21.420
um, I've got an opening
in my poker group next week.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.790
Why don't you join us?

04:22.790 --> 04:24.790
Er, my dance card's kind of full
these days, Rossi.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.040
You know, getting ready for a baby.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.880
Well, that's all the more reason
to play, you know.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.170
Jump-start the kid's college fund
with a little money.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.330
Okay.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.000
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.880
I left a file in the conference room.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.250
I was just in there.
I didn't see any files.

04:44.330 --> 04:46.620
-You sure about that?
-Positive. No files.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.000
I... I would have noticed.

04:48.620 --> 04:52.080
All right, your eyes are starting
to do that little thing that they do.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.710
-Let's have it.
-Have what?

04:53.710 --> 04:54.920
It's not my birthday.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.330
And I said to you,
"Please, no welcome back party."

04:59.040 --> 05:00.960
All right, look, I'm not saying,

05:00.960 --> 05:02.290
but I was supposed to distract you,

05:02.290 --> 05:05.460
so do me a favor and act surprised
when you go in there, all right?

05:06.210 --> 05:07.790
All right, I got you covered.

05:07.790 --> 05:11.420
And let's just give it
an extra 30 seconds, just to be sure.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.880
No problem.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.080
So my eyes do this thing, huh?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.210
Little bit.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.790
I better work on that before poker night.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.880
Surprise!

05:30.880 --> 05:32.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.170
-No, you didn't.
-

05:34.170 --> 05:36.540
Not my idea, babe. I was outnumbered.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.580
How long has this been in the works?

05:39.040 --> 05:41.080
Oh, two weeks. You didn't suspect?

05:41.080 --> 05:43.290
I, er, had no idea.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.750
That's good. A certain amount
of cluelessness is nice in a husband.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.210
Amen to that.

05:47.210 --> 05:50.330
A woman is entitled to her secrets,
especially from a profiler.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.880
Well, this profiler may not
be changing any diapers,

05:52.880 --> 05:54.790
but I will tear up some diaper cake.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.250
Oh, you look like
a diaper changer to me.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.500
Yes, you will be
changing some diapers.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.420
Ladies, I was joking, I was joking.
I was...

06:00.420 --> 06:02.750
Look, baby, I was joking. It was a joke.

06:04.210 --> 06:05.460
Yeah, we're on the way.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.000
I'll activate the child abduction
rapid deployment team from here.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.170
- -Yeah, thanks. Come in.

06:10.790 --> 06:13.380
Hey, I have been sent
to commandeer you, sir.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.250
Party's in high gear.

06:15.670 --> 06:18.420
There's been a double homicide
and a child abduction in Wichita.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.250
Er...

06:23.250 --> 06:24.710
I'll go let the others know.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.830
JJ.

06:28.210 --> 06:29.330
Give them 10 minutes.

06:29.330 --> 06:31.620
There's time while
the plane's being readied.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.750
"Parents are the bones
on which children sharpen their teeth."

07:40.750 --> 07:42.210
Peter Ustinov.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.330
Thank you.

07:44.540 --> 07:46.880
Ronnie Brewer is still missing.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.540
Both parents' eyes were filled with sand
and glued shut.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.960
Mr. Sandman, bring me a nightmare.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.880
This is a well-organized UnSub.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.500
He managed to kill both parents,
perform a complicated ritual

07:58.500 --> 08:00.330
and successfully abduct the boy.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.460
Yeah, JJ's right.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.790
It's a lot of moving parts
for one person to orchestrate.

08:03.790 --> 08:04.920
Could we be looking at a team?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.500
This is reminiscent of the killing
of the Clutter family in 1959,

08:07.500 --> 08:08.670
also in Kansas.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.120
That crime was perpetrated
by two ex-cons working together.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.750
The In Cold Blood murders.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.210
But that was a robbery gone bad.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.170
Doesn't seem to be the case here.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.290
Well, assuming Ronnie Brewer
was the ultimate target,

08:18.290 --> 08:19.830
why risk entering the home at all?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.500
I mean, wouldn't it be simpler just
to grab the kid on the way to school?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.830
Well, the abduction of the child
from a place of presumed safety

08:25.830 --> 08:27.880
must be an essential part of his ritual.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.540
Who knows? Maybe the killer had
a score to settle with mum and dad, too.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.960
The sealing of the eyes
could indicate remorse.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.460
He didn't want them to see
what he was doing to their kid.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.420
Then why not just
kill them immediately?

08:38.420 --> 08:39.580
I mean, he must have a reason

08:39.580 --> 08:42.170
for rendering the parents
functionally blind first.

08:42.170 --> 08:44.460
You know, the sand in the eyes
could be a purely symbolic gesture.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.000
The Sandman was a mythical character

08:46.000 --> 08:49.420
who would sprinkle magic dust
in the eyes of children while they slept.

08:49.420 --> 08:50.830
Yeah, but I thought
he was a benevolent figure,

08:50.830 --> 08:52.120
a bringer of good dreams.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.620
Not always. In one version of the myth,

08:53.620 --> 08:55.670
he would actually
pop the eyeballs out of kids

08:55.670 --> 08:57.670
to use as food for his own offspring.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.750
Jeez. I stand corrected.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.620
All right, when we land, Dave,
you and JJ go to the crime scene.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.790
Reid and Lewis, to the M.E.,

09:03.790 --> 09:05.710
and Morgan and I will get set up
at the precinct.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.080
Wichita P.D.
WICHITA, KANSAS

09:12.620 --> 09:14.210
An AMBER alert has been issued

09:14.210 --> 09:16.420
and police checkpoints
have been established.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.330
Here, here and here.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.250
I understand a witness saw a vehicle
leaving the area

09:20.250 --> 09:21.830
about the time of the murders?

09:21.830 --> 09:24.210
That's right. A farmhand
employed by Mr. Brewer.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.000
He reported seeing a white male
in a gray sedan speeding away.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.210
Did he get the make or model?

09:28.210 --> 09:31.040
No. The car was out on the main road,
not the driveway,

09:31.040 --> 09:33.580
so the worker didn't think much of it
until he discovered the bodies.

09:33.580 --> 09:34.920
About what time was that?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.210
Shortly before dawn.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.620
Well, this is a small
agricultural community.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.670
If the killer stalked
the Brewer family beforehand,

09:40.670 --> 09:41.960
someone may have noticed.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.210
Or he could be a seasonal worker
with no local connections.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.710
Which would be
our worst-case scenario,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.290
someone who came from nowhere
and is now headed back to nowhere.

09:51.210 --> 09:52.830
No tread marks anywhere.

09:52.830 --> 09:56.330
The UnSub probably parked his car
along the main road and walked in.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.080
Does the family have dogs?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.250
No. No security system either.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.670
Well, there's nothing around back.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.920
The garage and storage were unlocked.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.540
And I bet the Brewers probably
never locked their front door.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.830
You know, it's not so unusual.

10:08.830 --> 10:11.670
I grew up in a place like this
and that's just how it was.

10:11.670 --> 10:12.790
People trusted one another.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.960
Trust is a good thing.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.250
-So are deadbolts and a Rottweiler.
-

10:21.750 --> 10:25.290
Hopefully some of this blood's
the UnSub's and we can pull DNA.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.620
Lyla Brewer's body
was found in the hallway.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.670
But her husband
never made it out of bed.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.250
He must have been killed first.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.380
Well, it makes sense.

10:32.380 --> 10:34.880
Eliminate the primary threat
before moving on to mother and child.

10:41.460 --> 10:44.880
Mrs. Brewer spent some time
stumbling around out here.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.040
And in the child's bedroom,

10:48.040 --> 10:51.120
and in the bathroom and in the study.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.500
She covered a lot
of ground before dying.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.620
There are, er, fresh scratches
on the floor here.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.670
Too heavy for her to have moved.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.500
What if the UnSub did it to block
the top of the stairs?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.580
Seal off the child's escape, maybe?

11:10.580 --> 11:13.960
Or prevent a blinded Mrs. Brewer
from taking a fall?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.330
Strange that he'd be concerned
for her safety

11:16.330 --> 11:18.080
right before crushing her skull.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.210
I don't get it.

11:19.210 --> 11:20.580
If the goal was the child,

11:20.580 --> 11:23.710
and Jim Brewer's attack
was quick and lethal,

11:23.710 --> 11:25.500
why did the UnSub
let Lyla stumble around

11:25.500 --> 11:27.380
for so long before finally killing her?

11:31.170 --> 11:33.290
-Good to see you again, Dr. Reid.
-Nice to see you.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.420
-Again?
-Yeah.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.960
-We had a case here four years ago.
-Right.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.540
The tornado guy.
That was one for the books.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.460
So, do we have a COD on the victims?

11:40.460 --> 11:43.500
Mr. Brewer's was massive blood loss
from a severed trachea,

11:43.500 --> 11:45.670
most likely a thin-bladed serrated knife.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.000
And Mrs. Brewer?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.960
Her skull was fractured.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.790
Some type of blunt-force trauma.

11:50.790 --> 11:54.290
It's highly unusual for a killer to use
different weapons on different victims.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.920
Speaking of unusual, take a look.

11:57.710 --> 12:00.250
Corneal tissue samples
from the eyes of each victim.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.420
Mr. Brewer's on the left
and Mrs. Brewer's on the right.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.920
Mrs. Brewer's has
many more macrophages.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.250
That's right. It's a natural immunological
response to a foreign substance.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.330
Huh. But the white blood cells
in Mr. Brewer's sample

12:11.330 --> 12:12.500
are completely normal.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.120
Plain English, his eyes didn't react
to the glue.

12:16.290 --> 12:19.170
Plainer English, he was already dead
when it happened.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.250
Garcia's not coming up with much.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.830
The Brewer family was well-liked.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.250
No known enemies.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.250
What about registered
sex offenders in the area?

12:28.250 --> 12:30.380
There's over 1,000 in Wichita alone.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.000
Garcia's checking them out.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.750
Agent Hotchner, the body
of a young boy was just found.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.330
-Where?
-Prairie Creek Road,

12:38.330 --> 12:40.210
a few miles from the crime scene.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.040
The description matches
Ronnie Brewer.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.500
The child's body
has not yet been identified,

12:45.880 --> 12:48.920
but there is growing fear
that it could be Ronnie Brewer,

12:48.920 --> 12:52.420
the boy missing from the attack here
in Wichita, last night.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.500
Stay...

13:17.580 --> 13:19.420
Hey, Hotch, we're done here.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.710
It's definitely Ronnie.
I recognize him from the family photos.

13:23.290 --> 13:24.670
Body temperature
and state of rigor indicates

13:24.670 --> 13:26.460
that he's been dead
seven to eight hours.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.040
So he must have been killed
immediately after the abduction.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.080
Doesn't make sense.
All the effort put into taking him.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.250
Well, maybe the compulsion
is about the pursuit of the child,

13:34.250 --> 13:36.000
rather than the child itself.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.920
Well, if that's the case,
he's gonna try again soon.

13:38.620 --> 13:39.920
With someone else.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.330
Josie!

13:45.960 --> 13:47.380
Time to come in.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.750
I'm texting with Gaby. In a minute.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.000
That's what you said 20 minutes ago.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.670
I want your homework
done before dinner.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.080
Unfortunately, all of the blood
at the Brewer crime scene

14:09.080 --> 14:10.540
was either from Lyla or Jim Brewer.

14:10.540 --> 14:11.750
Nothing from the UnSub.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.920
I just talked to the M.E.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.210
Ronnie Brewer died from asphyxiation
but had not been sexually assaulted.

14:16.210 --> 14:18.790
Unless strangling the boy
was the sexual release.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.540
Or it could have been the UnSub's
first abduction and he panicked,

14:21.540 --> 14:23.710
disposed of the child immediately
once he had him.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.170
The M.E. also said that the type of glue
in the Brewers' eyes

14:26.170 --> 14:27.960
is frequently used for surgical closures,

14:27.960 --> 14:30.250
so the drying process on the skin
is well documented.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.540
15 a.m.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.040
20,

14:37.040 --> 14:38.460
so if that was our UnSub,

14:38.460 --> 14:40.620
what was he doing
in the house for that hour?

14:44.170 --> 14:46.580
All Josie ever does
is stare at that phone.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.710
It's not normal.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.380
She's 13. It's normal.

14:51.210 --> 14:54.120
Girls her age
should be out doing things.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.540
What's so funny?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.330
Picturing you 100 years ago.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.880
"Motor cars aren't normal.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.420
"What the hell's wrong
with the horse and buggy?"

15:04.670 --> 15:06.170
-Good night.
-Good night.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.710
The glue our UnSub used
is sold practically everywhere,

15:14.710 --> 15:16.750
so we can't isolate point of purchase.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.210
A mineral analysis
from the sand, however,

15:18.210 --> 15:21.290
indicates that it came from
the Seneca River in upstate New York.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.960
You okay?

15:27.750 --> 15:28.830
Yeah.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.620
Morgan, we're gonna find the people
who tried to kill you.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.290
He was in his pajamas.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.170
Ronnie Brewer.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.710
Out there by the side of the road,
he was still in his pajamas.

15:52.420 --> 15:53.830
I'm sorry, kid, I...

15:54.330 --> 15:55.500
I don't know, I...

15:57.170 --> 15:58.920
Six months on the side-lines.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.670
I guess I still have a few blisters
where I used to have calluses.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.380
I don't think that's what this is.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.330
Oh, no?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.080
Then what is it?

16:11.380 --> 16:14.420
You're about to be a dad. You know?

16:14.710 --> 16:17.960
You have to expect the world
to start to feel different.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.460
It just feels so hard.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.620
Not as in difficult.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.710
Literally hard.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.210
Like asphalt is hard.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.790
Like pavement.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.380
And children are soft.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.880
Yeah.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.080
Defenseless.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.670
That's why every day,

16:49.170 --> 16:51.420
we try to make this world a little safer.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.830
If there's one thing I'm sure of,

16:54.830 --> 16:58.330
it's that you and Savannah
are going to be great parents.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.540
Charge by the hour, Doc?

17:09.710 --> 17:10.790
Josie?

17:11.330 --> 17:12.380
Josie!

17:15.290 --> 17:16.920
No.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
Oh, my God.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.710
Eleven.
-

17:37.080 --> 17:38.210
So what do we know?

17:38.210 --> 17:39.620
Our father's dead, daughter's missing,

17:39.620 --> 17:40.750
but we may have caught a break here.

17:40.750 --> 17:41.880
The mother survived.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.080
Do you know if she's able to talk?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.250
No, she just went into surgery.
JJ's at the hospital with her.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.710
But it's definitely our guy.

17:46.710 --> 17:49.290
Glue and sand in both parents' eyes
and the father's throat was slit.

17:49.290 --> 17:51.000
I saw an alarm panel by the front door.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.120
Yeah, it wasn't activated,

17:52.120 --> 17:54.920
but it did keep a computerized log
of all home activity.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.920
35 a.m.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.420
47 a.m.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.040
An hour, just like the other attack,
but this time he left a witness.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.420
Well, he may have gotten sloppy
and assumed she was dead.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.460
I mean, she was found unconscious
in a pool of blood.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.580
Family have any other children?

18:06.580 --> 18:08.080
Just Josie, the missing daughter.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.460
-How old is she?
-Thirteen.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.460
Preferential sex offenders usually
cross age and gender lines

18:13.460 --> 18:15.210
only when their
preference isn't available.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.460
And Ronnie Brewer
wasn't sexually assaulted,

18:17.460 --> 18:19.120
so we may not be dealing
with a pedophile.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.290
No, I don't think we are.

18:20.290 --> 18:22.620
This is something else entirely.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.000
We're looking for a family annihilator.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.670
We believe he's a white male
in his early to mid-30s.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.210
He is intelligent,
well organized and meticulous.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.710
Family annihilators are often
quick and ruthless,

18:31.710 --> 18:34.710
but this UnSub prolongs
the suffering of his victims.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.290
He appears to kill in stages.

18:36.290 --> 18:39.330
First the father, then the mother
and finally the child.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.210
The mother seems to be
the primary target of the UnSub's rage.

18:42.210 --> 18:45.620
She is forced to endure a sense
of helplessness for upwards of an hour,

18:45.620 --> 18:46.710
while her child is in danger.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.380
So we're dealing with a sadist?

18:48.380 --> 18:50.620
Yes, but not sadism
as we typically think of it.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.500
Despite the savagery of the attacks,

18:52.500 --> 18:55.540
the killer does not derive gratification
from inflicting pain.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.830
It's from observing the panic
in his victims.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.330
The sadism is psychological.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.460
Something may have
happened in the UnSub's childhood

19:01.460 --> 19:02.670
where he felt unprotected.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.170
Perhaps his own mother turned a
blind eye to a real or perceived danger.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.620
And this could explain the ritual
of placing sand and glue

19:08.620 --> 19:09.750
in the parents' eyes,

19:09.750 --> 19:12.460
symbolically blinding them
as punishment.

19:12.460 --> 19:13.920
Ellie Zumwalt survived her injuries,

19:13.920 --> 19:17.620
and this may discourage this UnSub
and make him more cautious.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.170
Or have the opposite effect.

19:19.170 --> 19:22.040
It could infuriate him and spur him
to attack again, soon,

19:22.040 --> 19:23.790
with increased violence.

19:23.790 --> 19:26.500
Residents in remote or rural areas
and families with an only child

19:26.500 --> 19:29.170
should exercise extreme caution
in the coming days.

19:29.170 --> 19:30.290
Thank you.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.960
Still no sign of Josie Zumwalt.

19:53.210 --> 19:56.330
And we scoured every inch of road
in a 10-mile radius.

19:56.330 --> 19:58.620
Well, either she's still alive,

19:58.620 --> 20:01.210
or the UnSub did a much better job
of body concealment this time.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.420
If he did kill her,

20:04.420 --> 20:06.580
why deviate from his
previous disposal method?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.710
My gut says he's still holding her.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.290
But why her and not the Brewer boy?

20:11.290 --> 20:12.620
I'm not sure.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.420
But things didn't go as planned
in the second attack.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.170
Ellie Zumwalt survived.

20:16.170 --> 20:17.960
Okay. Maybe it's like we profiled.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.500
He has to kill sequentially, in the order
of the Brewer family murders.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.750
So, until the mother dies,
he can't kill the child.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.880
I'll have the hospital beef up security.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.000
Yeah.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.500
Guys. Take a look at this.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.580
The hourglass.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.250
Yeah,
it isn't in the Christmas photo,

20:38.250 --> 20:39.880
which was only taken
a couple of months earlier.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.830
Could be a recent purchase
or they might have moved it there

20:41.830 --> 20:42.960
from some other place in the house.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.250
Except we know the UnSub spends
an hour at each crime scene.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.920
What if he brought it
with him as a kind of timer?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.120
Okay. I'll have Sergeant Whitfield

20:50.120 --> 20:52.750
search the Zumwalt house
for a similar hourglass.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.790
It's Hotch.

20:55.790 --> 20:58.330
Ellie Zumwalt is out
of surgery and awake.

20:58.330 --> 20:59.500
Thank you.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.960
We appreciate you talking
to us, Mrs. Zumwalt.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.790
We know this is a difficult time.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.380
My husband is dead, isn't he?

21:07.040 --> 21:08.080
Yes, he is.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.040
We're very sorry.

21:12.420 --> 21:13.920
What about Josie?

21:15.170 --> 21:17.040
Is my daughter all right?

21:17.040 --> 21:18.120
We're hopeful.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.620
That's why it's important that
you tell us everything you can

21:20.620 --> 21:22.000
about what happened.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.210
I was asleep,
and then there was a scream.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.620
It was Josie.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.920
I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.080
Josie kept screaming.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.750
And every time I went
to where I thought she was,

21:38.750 --> 21:40.580
the scream came from somewhere else.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.080
We realize you couldn't see well,

21:42.080 --> 21:45.120
but could you make out
any features about this man?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.210
No.

21:47.330 --> 21:50.380
He wore something on his face.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.540
They were like, um,
I don't know, glasses.

21:53.540 --> 21:54.750
Like eyeglasses?

21:54.750 --> 21:56.080
No, no. Bigger than that.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.250
More like, um, goggles.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.670
That's all I could make out.

22:01.460 --> 22:02.710
Did he speak?

22:04.460 --> 22:05.620
Only at the end.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.080
"Eleven."-Eleven.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.290
That's all he said.

22:12.750 --> 22:13.830
"Eleven."

22:14.830 --> 22:16.500
Mrs. Zumwalt,

22:16.500 --> 22:19.080
do your or anybody in the family
own an hourglass?

22:20.920 --> 22:24.790
Police found this in your living room.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.420
I've never seen that before in my life.

22:28.790 --> 22:29.960
What you got, baby girl?

22:29.960 --> 22:32.960
What I've got is fail, fail
and more fail.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.750
Remember
Thomas Alva Edison, Penelope.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.080
"I have not failed.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.880
"I've just found 10,000 ways
that won't work."

22:39.880 --> 22:41.120
Okay, let me rephrase what I just said.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.710
I'm currently waist-deep
in what is not working.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.750
Despite the distinctive craftsmanship,

22:45.750 --> 22:48.460
I cannot figure out
who made these hourglasses,

22:48.460 --> 22:50.170
and I haven't been able to find
a single person

22:50.170 --> 22:53.420
who recently relocated
from upstate New York to Wichita.

22:53.420 --> 22:57.120
Something must connect our UnSub
to the Seneca River.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.620
All the sand in the world right here

22:58.620 --> 23:01.500
and this guy brings dirt
from 1,500 miles away.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.580
Garcia, you've confirmed
that the hourglasses were handcrafted?

23:04.580 --> 23:07.460
Oh, for sure. We're talking
top-notch museum quality,

23:07.460 --> 23:09.290
but not by any artisan known

23:09.290 --> 23:10.880
in the high-end
glass-blowing community.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.460
And, yes, there is such a thing

23:12.460 --> 23:14.500
as the high-end
glass-blowing community.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.670
All right, look for boys,
ages eight to 12,

23:16.670 --> 23:19.790
who were sexually victimized
and/or abducted in upstate New York

23:19.790 --> 23:21.580
in the mid-1990s, all right?

23:21.580 --> 23:23.710
Okay. Hit you back if and when.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.620
They're analyzing the sand
from both hourglasses now

23:27.620 --> 23:29.540
to see if it matches what was put
in the victims' eyes.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.210
So far no prints or DNA.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.380
The UnSub's careful.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.040
And precise. I calculated
the width of hourglass necks

23:35.040 --> 23:37.920
with the average grain of sand,
having a .2-millimeter diameter

23:37.920 --> 23:40.620
and a volume
of .0042 cubic millimeters.

23:40.620 --> 23:44.460
Given the weight of the sand, that's a
gravity flow duration of 3,600 seconds.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.330
You know, obviously give or take a few.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.580
Skill level off the charts,
yet his work is unknown.

23:49.580 --> 23:51.420
Not for sale, not even for display.

23:51.420 --> 23:52.960
This guy operates in a vacuum.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.420
Which speaks to the intensely private
nature of his obsession.

23:56.420 --> 23:59.540
Mineral analysis just came in
on the hourglass sand.

23:59.540 --> 24:00.920
Also from upstate New York?

24:00.920 --> 24:02.000
No, it's local.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.620
Most likely from the Platte River.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.210
What's the matter, Sergeant?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.250
It's what they found mixed in
with the sand.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.420
Human bone and tooth enamel.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.330
Please, don't hurt me.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.750
Please.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.540
Hi there.

24:47.540 --> 24:50.620
Er, I was trying to call Hotch,
but it kept going to voicemail.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.420
He's still at the hospital with JJ.
What's going on?

24:52.420 --> 24:54.580
Okay, I did what man chocolate asked.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.880
I got this list.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.620
There are certain things
that should never, ever exist,

24:58.620 --> 25:01.460
and one of those is this
depressingly long list.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.540
Does anything specific jump out at you?

25:03.540 --> 25:06.120
Aside from the horribleness of it all, no.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.880
You know, send me all the police,
hospital and child services transcripts

25:08.880 --> 25:10.080
associated with the cases.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.290
Everything on all of them?

25:11.290 --> 25:12.500
Yeah, I'll print out hard copies here.

25:12.750 --> 25:13.920
Okay. You're gonna need a forklift,

25:13.920 --> 25:15.380
and I hope
you're using recyclable paper,

25:15.380 --> 25:17.040
but on its way.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.500
All right. Thank you so much, Garcia.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.420
Why are you doing this?

25:28.080 --> 25:30.080
I never did anything to you.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.290
I don't understand.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.830
No, no, no. Please! Please, I'll be quiet.

25:36.830 --> 25:39.670
No, don't!
Please, I don't want to go in there!

25:39.670 --> 25:42.540
I promise I'll be quiet! No, don't!

25:42.540 --> 25:44.210
No! Don't!

25:44.210 --> 25:46.380
Please, I'll be quiet! Please!

25:47.330 --> 25:48.920
I want to go home!

25:48.920 --> 25:50.120
Please!

26:05.210 --> 26:08.830
I wonder what
the UnSub meant by "Eleven."

26:08.830 --> 26:11.500
We know he measures the time spent
in each house.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.040
It could be some sort of countdown.

26:13.710 --> 26:15.460
What are you thinking, Aaron?

26:15.460 --> 26:16.830
The hospital report on Ellie Zumwalt.

26:16.830 --> 26:18.120
Her injuries were minor.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.330
It was the gradual loss of blood
that caused her to lose consciousness.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.250
Well, the UnSub must have thought
she bled out and left her for dead.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.380
That was his big mistake.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.750
I don't think there was a mistake.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.880
What do you mean?

26:27.880 --> 26:30.250
What if Ellie Zumwalt
was never meant to die.

26:30.250 --> 26:33.330
That the mistake that the UnSub made
was actually at the first crime scene?

26:33.330 --> 26:35.170
The Brewer murders?
The guy's a family annihilator.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.460
He killed them all. To me
that sounds like mission accomplished.

26:37.460 --> 26:39.460
We didn't understand why he used
two different murder weapons

26:39.460 --> 26:40.670
on Jim and Lyla Brewer.

26:40.670 --> 26:42.500
That's because there never was
a second weapon.

26:43.460 --> 26:44.750
I'm still not following.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.210
Dave, you said that
a large piece of furniture

26:46.210 --> 26:48.380
was moved to block the top of the stairs
of the Brewer house.

26:48.380 --> 26:51.670
That's right. JJ and I assumed
it was to prevent her from escaping.

26:51.670 --> 26:52.790
I don't think so.

26:52.790 --> 26:53.960
It wasn't to set her up for the kill.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.420
It was to keep her from falling down
the stairs and killing herself.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.620
So her skull fracture
was what, an accident?

26:58.620 --> 27:02.210
The victim was blinded,
hardwood floors slippery with blood.

27:02.210 --> 27:04.960
She could have fallen and hit her head
on a blunt object.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.380
That means the UnSub's plan all along
was for both mothers to survive.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.460
Exactly.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.710
-But why?
-That's what we need to figure out.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.830
Josie's fate depends on it.

27:38.620 --> 27:41.210
-Found someone.
-Who?

27:41.210 --> 27:42.960
Patrick Sorenson of Oswego, New York.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.830
He was on Garcia's list
of potential victims.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.000
Abducted by a pedophile in 1993
when he was nine,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.170
raised by a single mother
with substance abuse problems.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.750
A mother who was literally asleep
at the wheel when the boy was taken.

27:51.750 --> 27:55.250
She was passed out drunk in her car,
parked behind their house.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.420
Mummy!

28:15.290 --> 28:17.460
The boy said he screamed for help,
but the mum never came.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.000
Well, that explains the ritual

28:19.000 --> 28:20.540
of blinding the surrogate mother
while she sleeps.

28:20.540 --> 28:21.710
And it gets worse. Listen to this.

28:21.710 --> 28:23.210
While Patrick was recovering
in the hospital,

28:23.210 --> 28:25.580
the mother left a good-bye note
on the kitchen table

28:25.580 --> 28:26.960
and was never heard from again.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.960
She abandoned him.
The guilt must have been too much.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.580
Any idea of the whereabouts
of Patrick or the mother?

28:30.580 --> 28:31.880
The mum never surfaced.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.120
Patrick went into the foster care system
and moved back to Oswego,

28:34.120 --> 28:36.290
where he lived quietly
up until six weeks ago,

28:36.290 --> 28:37.880
when he vanished without a trace.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.420
Garcia can't even find a picture of him
as an adult,

28:39.420 --> 28:41.540
but here, read that part right there.

28:41.540 --> 28:43.210
It says here Patrick told authorities

28:43.210 --> 28:45.580
he got through the assault
by focusing on sand.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.750
His attacker made him
stare at an hourglass,

28:47.750 --> 28:48.880
while the abuse went on.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.250
He was told that if he didn't cry
until all the sand emptied out,

28:51.250 --> 28:52.420
he wouldn't be killed.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.920
So the trauma of the assault was fused
with the image of an hourglass.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.500
And launched an obsession with time,

28:56.500 --> 28:58.120
so much so that he went on
to build devices

28:58.120 --> 29:00.750
that measure it with
extraordinary mathematical precision.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.420
00,

29:03.420 --> 29:05.460
00.

29:05.460 --> 29:06.580
Eleven hours later.

29:06.580 --> 29:07.750
That's what he meant
with Ellie Zumwalt.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.580
He was telling her the amount of time
that he, himself,

29:09.580 --> 29:10.960
had been held in captivity.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.380
And that may be
Josie Zumwalt's timeline.

29:12.380 --> 29:14.250
So the clock is on Ellie, not Josie.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.250
She's got 11 hours to give this UnSub
what he didn't get from his own mother.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.620
30 this morning,

29:18.620 --> 29:20.500
30 this afternoon.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.750
JJ, are you still at the hospital?

29:22.750 --> 29:24.120
Good. Here's what I need you to do.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.040
An apology?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.210
We can do it from here.

29:29.210 --> 29:32.170
This room, one cameraman,
no reporters.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.290
I don't understand.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.330
The man who took your daughter
left you alive intentionally.

29:37.330 --> 29:38.960
But... But why?

29:39.460 --> 29:43.920
Because he needs to hear you express
how sorry you are for what happened.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.040
But it wasn't my fault.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.250
Josie knows that I didn't...

29:47.250 --> 29:49.750
I know. You're not apologizing to Josie.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.420
In fact, don't ever mention her name.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.170
Just refer to her as your child.
Don't even say daughter.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.460
You're really talking
to the man who took her.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.040
Well, how do we know
he'll be watching?

29:59.040 --> 30:01.750
My team's coordinating with local media
to get the word out.

30:02.170 --> 30:03.620
He'll be watching.

30:03.620 --> 30:06.750
And if I do this, then he'll let Josie go?

30:07.210 --> 30:09.670
There's a chance, yes.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.500
Word just in from a local hospital

30:20.500 --> 30:21.830
that Ellie Zumwalt,

30:21.830 --> 30:25.420
recovering from injuries suffered
in the latest attack on local families,

30:25.420 --> 30:27.960
is going to speak to the public
within an hour.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.250
We don't know what
this unexpected statement will be,

30:30.250 --> 30:32.210
but concern is rising as the hours pass

30:32.210 --> 30:34.380
with no word
on her abducted daughter.

30:34.670 --> 30:36.420
Come on, Penelope, think.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.670
Patrick Sorenson didn't
just vanish into thin air.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.120
There's got to be some way that he...

30:48.290 --> 30:54.290
Oh, yes, there might be some
Thomas Alva Edison in me yet.

30:54.290 --> 30:55.420
What do you got, Garcia?

30:55.420 --> 30:58.250
What I have got
is Betty Cordray of Wichita, Kansas,

30:58.250 --> 30:59.710
which I know makes no sense,

30:59.710 --> 31:01.330
but actually, Betty Cordray
is not Betty Cordray,

31:01.330 --> 31:03.790
she's Betty Sorenson of long-lost fame.

31:03.790 --> 31:05.170
The mother
who abandoned Patrick.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.120
None other.
HOTCH: Is she still in the area?

31:07.120 --> 31:09.420
No. She died six weeks ago
of kidney failure,

31:09.420 --> 31:10.580
and then when the paperwork started,

31:10.580 --> 31:12.000
you know, the paperwork
that happens when you die,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.670
her real identity was revealed and
Patrick was called as her next of kin.

31:15.670 --> 31:16.830
That must have been the trigger.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.580
That was when he dropped off
the map in New York.

31:18.580 --> 31:21.330
Yeah, and if he was holding out hope
for answers from that mother one day,

31:21.330 --> 31:22.500
that hope was suddenly gone.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.080
Garcia, did Betty Sorenson
own any property in the Wichita area?

31:25.580 --> 31:27.290
Nope, she lived in a studio apartment.

31:27.290 --> 31:29.670
And after she died,
was she buried or cremated?

31:29.670 --> 31:32.210
Er... Neither.
She was held in the morgue,

31:32.210 --> 31:34.420
Patrick was called to identify her body
but he never showed up.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.000
I guess she's still there?

31:36.290 --> 31:37.710
All right, I'll check it out.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.500
We're recording.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.250
This is a message for my child.

31:44.790 --> 31:48.790
If you can hear me, sweetheart,
please listen carefully.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.750
There's something I need to tell you.

31:50.750 --> 31:52.290
I've been a bad mother,

31:53.670 --> 31:56.460
and I did a terrible thing
to let this happen to you.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.120
It's all my fault.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.290
You deserve better than this.

32:04.830 --> 32:07.210
You deserve so much more.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.170
Even though I know you're brave,

32:11.790 --> 32:14.540
And you're not crying,

32:14.540 --> 32:16.420
you need to know
I cried for you.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.500
You're so much stronger than I am.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.380
Stronger than I am.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.250
Honey,
if you come home safely now,

32:27.250 --> 32:30.790
I promise I will love you
and hold you

32:30.790 --> 32:34.120
and never let
any more harm come to you.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.710
If you can hear me now,
please call as soon as you can.

32:37.710 --> 32:39.210
You know how to reach me.

32:39.500 --> 32:43.830
I promise I will explain to you,
once and for all, why I did what I did.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.420
-Okay, it's over. You did great.
-

32:56.420 --> 32:57.580
You did great.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.540
We'll keep bodies on ice
for as long as three or four months.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.830
If nobody claims them by then,
they get buried on the city's dime.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.710
And Mrs. Sorenson's son
never showed up?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.120
No, ma'am. We tried
to track him down, but...

33:12.880 --> 33:15.920
This is it. Pretty sad.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.120
You live your life,

33:18.120 --> 33:21.290
and you end up
like unclaimed baggage.

33:26.080 --> 33:29.460
Hotch, we solved the mystery
of the bone fragments in the hourglass.

33:31.830 --> 33:33.710
Patrick was going to have
that reunion with his mother,

33:33.710 --> 33:34.750
one way or the other.

33:48.540 --> 33:52.000
Patrick Sorenson has to be
holed up nearby, but where?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.880
Someplace secluded, that's for sure.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.580
Hauling a corpse through the front door
would tend to perk up the neighbors.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.170
Well, if there was an 11-hour clock
on Josie Zumwalt,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.210
the bell just rang.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.120
Don't hurt me. Please.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.210
Please.

34:16.380 --> 34:17.620
Call her.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.670
What?

34:19.670 --> 34:21.210
Your mother.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.620
-Hello Is that you?

34:35.620 --> 34:37.330
Are you all right, sweetheart?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.790
I want to come home, Mum.

34:39.790 --> 34:41.960
Keep it going. Keep it going.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.120
You will. You will, soon.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.580
But first I need to explain to you
why I wasn't there to protect you.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.120
What are you talking about?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.580
It wasn't your fault that...

34:51.580 --> 34:52.880
Yes. Yes, it was.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.540
I need to explain to you
why I did the things I did.

34:56.540 --> 34:57.790
I have an addiction,

34:57.790 --> 35:00.540
and it kept me from being the mother
I should have been for you.

35:00.540 --> 35:01.920
An addiction?

35:01.920 --> 35:03.380
Why... Why are you...

35:03.380 --> 35:05.210
No, don't interrupt me, please.

35:05.580 --> 35:08.500
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.210
I know you're brave.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.250
I know you don't cry.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.830
But you need to come home.

35:16.830 --> 35:19.040
Come back to our house.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.620
He's not gonna let me.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.540
You have to come back to me!
Do you hear me, Josie?

35:24.540 --> 35:26.750
Josie! Josie?

35:27.960 --> 35:29.000
Don't!

35:29.710 --> 35:32.460
No! Please! I don't want to be in here!

35:32.460 --> 35:35.170
No! Please! No!

35:35.170 --> 35:37.380
I just want to go home!

35:37.380 --> 35:38.620
-Please!
-Lies. Lies.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.920
Lies!

35:43.210 --> 35:44.830
I said her name.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.170
I forgot.

35:48.170 --> 35:49.620
It's all right.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.580
Garcia, were you able to trace it?

35:51.580 --> 35:52.750
No. I was so close.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.330
But I have the cell tower
it pinged off of.

35:54.330 --> 35:55.920
I just sent that to your phones.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.540
What's this area like, Sergeant?

35:58.540 --> 36:00.380
Mostly blue-collar residential.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.670
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.

36:02.670 --> 36:05.170
That's where the old railroad spur line
used to come into town.

36:05.170 --> 36:08.080
Mostly just abandoned structures
out there now.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.290
We're on it.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.290
There.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.170
Grey sedan.

36:27.580 --> 36:28.830
New York plates.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.540
I've been a bad mother.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.330
I did a terrible thing
to let this happen to you.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.670
It's all my fault.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.670
I have an addiction.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.880
You're so much stronger than I am.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.710
Time's up, Patrick! Drop the weapon!

37:04.000 --> 37:05.210
- -

37:37.540 --> 37:39.040
Okay, the bet's to you, General.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.710
All right, I see you

37:41.960 --> 37:43.500
and raise you 10 bucks.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.080
Oh, hell, no. I'm out.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.960
All right, that General's out.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.290
And the host makes three.

37:48.290 --> 37:50.830
Okay, I'm really trying to figure out
which one of you all is bluffing.

37:50.830 --> 37:51.960
The retired Marine General

37:51.960 --> 37:54.920
or Mr. Rock-and-Roll
Hall-of-Fame over here.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.960
This hand's too good
to waste on a bluff.

37:58.170 --> 38:00.580
Is that the lyric
to one of your songs, Joe?

38:01.960 --> 38:04.540
All right, I think
both of you all are bluffing.

38:04.540 --> 38:05.670
So here's what I'm gonna do.

38:05.670 --> 38:07.290
I'm gonna see your 10

38:07.290 --> 38:09.420
Ooh.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.750
-Boom. What you think about that?
-Step up.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.080
"Never interrupt an enemy
when he's making a mistake."

38:16.080 --> 38:18.170
Ooh!
-Sun Tzu, Art of War.

38:18.170 --> 38:22.120
A book, I believe, both of these generals
may be familiar with.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.170
Okay, it's on you, Joe.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.540
Okay, okay.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.790
-That's pretty good. That's pretty good.
-Full house.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.460
Whoa!

38:31.460 --> 38:32.670
Marines have landed.

38:32.670 --> 38:35.040
Okay. Okay, I don't know if you're ready
for what I got right here.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.250
Oh, I think we're ready.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.040
Because in the words of Mr. Withers,

38:39.580 --> 38:42.170
-"Ain't no sunshine in these cards."
-

38:42.620 --> 38:44.210
No, man!

38:44.210 --> 38:45.960
All right, all right, all right.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.960
No. No, wait. We agreed

38:47.960 --> 38:52.420
25% of every pot
goes to the baby Morgan tuition fund.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.750
Much appreciated.

38:53.750 --> 38:56.290
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is this child going to school,

38:56.290 --> 38:57.580
Harvard and Yale?

38:58.790 --> 39:02.040
Hey, listen, I really appreciate
you letting me rob you for the night,

39:02.040 --> 39:04.500
but, um, I got to get up out of here.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.620
Come on.
MAN 2: Come on.

39:05.620 --> 39:09.170
For what? You get 25%
out of each pot just for sitting there.

39:09.170 --> 39:10.500
Okay, look here, Pops...

39:10.500 --> 39:12.000
-Said the weasel.
-

39:12.960 --> 39:15.620
Okay, okay, I clearly cannot compete
at this table,

39:15.620 --> 39:17.920
but, look, I got to go
hang out with wifey.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.330
We're taking those Lamaze lessons.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.790
Lamaze. Is that where they do
the breathing to ease the pain?

39:21.790 --> 39:23.170
Yeah, it actually works.

39:23.170 --> 39:26.080
You know, you breathe fast
and then slow, you know, like...

39:27.290 --> 39:29.210
I don't know, like a...
Like a dog or something.

39:29.210 --> 39:32.120
I wouldn't touch that line
with a road crew tour bus.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.620
- -Do you remember everything

39:33.620 --> 39:35.000
you've ever touched? I'm just saying.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.460
Gentlemen, seriously,
this has been a pleasure.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.250
Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.460
-All right, Morgan, take care of yourself.
-All right. Later.

39:42.460 --> 39:45.330
All right, everybody in.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

39:45.330 --> 39:47.210
I don't need to talk back...

39:50.040 --> 39:52.580
"Lucky I'm sane
after all I've been through.

39:53.670 --> 39:56.120
"Life's been good to me so far."

39:56.120 --> 39:57.380
Joe Walsh.

39:58.750 --> 39:59.920
Hey.

40:00.710 --> 40:01.750
Hey, beautiful.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.080
How was the poker game?

40:04.080 --> 40:05.120
Mmm... Ah.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.330
Broke even.

40:07.330 --> 40:13.000
But this little one chilling inside
your beautiful belly didn't do so badly.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.670
-Whatever that means.
-Don't worry about it.

40:16.670 --> 40:19.790
There's, er, one more thing.

40:20.290 --> 40:23.120
Garcia, she asked me
about a week ago,

40:23.120 --> 40:24.880
who the godparents were gonna be,

40:24.880 --> 40:30.420
as in, "Hello, like, I'm right here,
like, right in front of you."

40:30.830 --> 40:32.000
She'll be wonderful,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.670
but I have a few folks on my side of
the aisle lobbying for the same position.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.250
Oh, Lord. So what are we doing,
god-parenting by committee?

40:39.250 --> 40:40.880
May have to be.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.380
Derek!

40:44.750 --> 40:46.830
TO BE CONTINUED...
