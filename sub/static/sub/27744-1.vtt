Oh.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.575
-Where do you think you're going?
-We can't go back.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.327
We had a long run.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
And I've seen my death,

01:19.370 --> 01:22.373
it's me walking peacefully into the ocean.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.417
You wanna come?

01:24.501 --> 01:28.588
Well, I've seen your death, too,
and my hands are way more on your throat.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.883
Fine. Then we'll be beach people now.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.720
We'll fondue everything,
and what we don't fondue, we'll toast.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.057
How could the kids not have told us
the house sold?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.268
Unless-- Oh, God.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.647
Unless they did tell us and we forgot.
Frankie...

01:46.314 --> 01:47.440
did you forget?

01:47.524 --> 01:51.277
What happened to "us" forgetting?
I thought we forgot as a team now.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.198
You're right. And this is exactly
what they'd want us doing.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.866
Doubting ourselves.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.328
-Frankie, I will never doubt you.
-Thank you.

02:03.039 --> 02:06.292
You really think it's a good idea
to light a joint with a blowtorch?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.086
That lasted a good second.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.390
Oh, it's the kids.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.475
It's the fourth time they've called.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.145
-Oh, to hell with them.
-Totally.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.104
Uh...

02:26.187 --> 02:27.522
Frankie, it's a little thing,

02:27.605 --> 02:30.358
but would you not put my phone
in your boobs anymore?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.610
How the hell did that get there?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.446
Can you check your bra for mine?

02:36.281 --> 02:37.323
Wait a minute.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.576
Never mind.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.702
Mine's in here, too.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.287
[chuckles]

02:46.457 --> 02:48.001
Whose is this?

02:58.052 --> 02:59.012
[Robert] Oh.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.182
Robert?

03:03.016 --> 03:03.850
[whispers]
Robert?

03:03.933 --> 03:05.476
[whispers]
Sorry. Didn't know what else to do!

03:05.560 --> 03:06.436
Everything okay?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.188
Fine!

03:08.271 --> 03:11.065
He fainted! He just needs air!

03:11.149 --> 03:12.901
[Robert] You should faint, too. It works.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.986
How do you think I got through
my first marriage?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.654
-[Sol] He's coming.
-Oh, shit.

03:17.947 --> 03:18.781
Let's get him to the couch.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.367
Aren't you even a little cold?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.036
Oh... no. [chuckles]

03:26.331 --> 03:27.457
[doorknob clicks]

03:28.166 --> 03:30.126
[Grace] Looks like they fixed the house.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.045
Nobody inside. It's totally empty.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.797
[Frankie]
Or it's not and this is an ambush.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.051
I've seen this Gerard Butler movie
too many times. [chuckles]

03:38.134 --> 03:41.679
It's a beach house in La Jolla, Frankie,
not an embassy in Baghdad.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.390
You obviously have never seen
<i>Fallen Shores.</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:45.558
Nor have you.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.228
That was an idea you scribbled on
an Entenmann's box.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.314
Hey, since they haven't moved in yet,

03:51.397 --> 03:53.399
maybe there's a chance
we can get our house back.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.317
Exactly.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.111
-Like Gerard Butler did in <i>Fallen Shores.</i>
-[scoffs]

03:57.695 --> 03:58.571
[doorknob clicks]

03:58.821 --> 04:00.782
-It's locked.
-No worries.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.617
I have a hidden key.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.327
[exhales]

04:04.410 --> 04:06.746
It's hidden from your memory, isn't it?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.873
So it's working on a certain level.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.291
[chuckles]

04:13.544 --> 04:14.671
Aha!

04:15.463 --> 04:16.714
Oh, damn it.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.095
Oh, of course. Of course.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.389
I know you're in there. Come on.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.974

Oh, she's coming toward us.

04:36.901 --> 04:41.114
Oh, my God, Grace,
she looks exactly like you!

04:41.739 --> 04:44.367
Only the years have ravaged her.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.996

-Oh, God.
-Oh, God.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.426
-Oh, God.
-Talk about a gender reveal party.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.470
I would like to turn away.
My body is not moving.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.098
Is he okay? Daddy, are you okay?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.391
[Coyote] Are you okay?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.102
-Hello.
-What the hell is happening in here?

05:11.185 --> 05:14.814
It's a Freudian nightmare
with a very special guest star.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.859
Please put this on.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.360
-Bud, no.
-Thanks.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.279
[Roy] I'll just...

05:22.447 --> 05:23.823
Ah.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.203
Roy, would you mind putting on
your actual clothes?

05:29.287 --> 05:30.288
[chuckles] Sure. Sorry.

05:33.041 --> 05:33.958
Hi, I'm Roy.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.418
-Hi, Roy.
-Hi, Roy.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.587
[chuckles]

05:38.629 --> 05:40.590
Did you know he's a graduate of Stanford?

05:42.008 --> 05:45.762
Smart... smart penis-- Man!

05:46.429 --> 05:47.263
Man with a...

05:50.266 --> 05:52.852
-What's everyone doing here?
-[Robert] This better be serious.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.315
It's Mom and Grace. They...
Well, they stole a golf cart.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.443
I said serious,
not the plot to<i> Caddyshack.</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:02.153
[Bud]
They haven't been seen in hours.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.072
They don't even have their purses.
We're worried.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.033
Sorry. I can't find my pants.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.660
[Brianna] Don't be sorry.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.371
[Robert sighs]

06:12.288 --> 06:13.581
Are there others?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.124
[grunts]

06:16.334 --> 06:18.336
Oh, this is horrible.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.172
I feel like I'm trespassing
in my own house.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.425
Oh, if only you could feel that way
when I'm in my bathtub.

06:24.509 --> 06:28.096
Ah, we were in the middle of
a conversation!

06:28.179 --> 06:30.139
Well, I thought the conversation ended

06:30.223 --> 06:32.392
when I said,
"I'm gonna go take a bath now."

06:32.517 --> 06:34.519
-[footsteps]
-Ah!

06:35.019 --> 06:36.813
[whispers] Someone's coming! Get down.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.022
[footsteps]

06:38.481 --> 06:41.359
[Frankie]
Oh, shit, fondue pot! Fondue pot!

06:41.442 --> 06:43.111
[groans]

06:45.488 --> 06:47.198
[sighs]

06:47.281 --> 06:50.743
I neither hide nor seek
nor peek nor boo,

06:51.369 --> 06:55.581
because those are child's games
and I hate children...

06:55.873 --> 06:57.166
because they're awful.

06:58.042 --> 07:02.588
Now, make yourself be known
and don't be a child.

07:05.758 --> 07:06.843
Hey, girl!

07:06.926 --> 07:08.052
Who the fuck are you?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.804
Who the fuck are you?

07:09.887 --> 07:11.597
No, I "who-the-fuck-are-you"-ed first.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.057
Seems we're at an impasse.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.977
It seems you're breaking and entering.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.896
No, we just wanted to see the house again.
We used to live here.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.274
Not to bore you with a bunch of legalese,

07:21.357 --> 07:25.736
but double stampsies, no erasies,
we want our house back.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.780
No takesies-backsies.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.616
Damn. I see you went to law school.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.327
See, we didn't intend to sell.
It was a mistake.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.246
We weren't thinking right.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.499
So now you've sobered up,
you're breaking into people's homes.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.503
Well, our kids sold it right from under us
after we asked them to.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.047
I can see why, it's a terrible house.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.007
-Pardon?
-What?

07:46.090 --> 07:48.426
If you think it's terrible,
why did you buy it?

07:48.509 --> 07:50.011
Oh, I didn't.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.721
"Who did", you ask?

07:51.804 --> 07:56.058
My extremely wealthy employer
who demands anonymity.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.936
Who is it you said demands anonymity?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.104
I don't know why

08:00.188 --> 08:04.734
I am not hearing the scurrying
of orthopedic shoes to Applebee's.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.152
-God, who--
-Ow...

08:06.235 --> 08:07.570
Grace, I got this.

08:07.653 --> 08:13.201
You know, I knew the second we met
we were gonna be<i> amigos huevos.</i>

08:13.284 --> 08:14.702
Egg friends?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.288
<i>Egg-xactly.</i>

08:17.371 --> 08:19.999
[chuckles]
And over eggs we're gonna dish

08:20.082 --> 08:22.376
about my gay ex and my black son.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.129
How much in common do we have?

08:25.213 --> 08:27.840
I don't know, do you hate you?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.344
[gasps]
Take it, Grace.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.304
[exhales]

08:33.513 --> 08:36.140
We are both formidable people
who detest children.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.683
So I don't wanna waste your time.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.269
But I need to talk to your boss
for maybe five minutes.

08:40.353 --> 08:44.148
Not even five seconds, egg friend.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.610
No tea, no shade,
but why you gaggin', bitch?

08:48.444 --> 08:49.445
-What?
-What?

08:49.779 --> 08:50.613
Okay.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.908
-Out to the curb,
-Whoo!

08:53.991 --> 08:57.328
...like two antique floor lamps
that no one knows what to do with

08:57.411 --> 08:59.997
once Gene Kelly's widow dies.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.499
[Frankie] Gene Kelly died?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.626
You know, there's a thing called a phone.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.336
Yeah, we tried calling you,

09:05.419 --> 09:08.464
but you didn't answer,
then we were worried about you, too.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.509
But we're here now
and can see that everything is cool.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.511
This may feel like an awkward moment--

09:13.594 --> 09:15.179
-Yeah.
-Which it is.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.683
But it is also a teachable one.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.229
Although, it is not
quite what it looks like,

09:23.312 --> 09:26.315
it is a little bit what it looks like,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.609
except we didn't--

09:28.693 --> 09:31.612
Stop teaching... please.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.407
[exhales]

09:34.865 --> 09:36.242
So you wanna say something?

09:36.325 --> 09:37.243
No.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.663
Jesus.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.418
-What an asshole that guy was.
-He's a complete monster.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.212
Why do I want his approval so badly?

09:48.296 --> 09:49.672
I don't know...

09:50.423 --> 09:52.758
-But I want it, too.
-Right?

09:53.175 --> 09:55.511
Ah! This sucks coconuts.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.930
I'm gonna do something constructive.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.101
Are you gonna stop with the sign
or torch the whole house?

10:02.184 --> 10:03.519
-I might as well.
-[blowtorch blowing]

10:03.603 --> 10:06.147
The rich jerk who bought the place
doesn't care,

10:06.230 --> 10:09.609
hiring that tall drink of fabulous water,

10:09.692 --> 10:11.652
who I will be friends with,

10:11.736 --> 10:13.362
to do all the work.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.407
-Oh, my God.
-What?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.908
I know who bought the house.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.536
-Who?
-Who do we know who's extremely wealthy,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.538
who wouldn't want us to know
who they were,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.582
and who threatens to buy everything?

10:25.041 --> 10:28.210
Oh, my God, Leslie Uggams!
[chuckles]

10:28.294 --> 10:29.295
No, it's Nick!

10:29.795 --> 10:31.213
Who's Nick Uggams?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
-No--
-Oh, I know Nick Uggams.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.844
I'm talking about my Nick,
my former Nick.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.138
He bought the house.
It must've been him.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.683
Today, he threatened to buy
all of Walden Villas if I didn't leave.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.810
This is incredible! It's amazing!

10:44.894 --> 10:47.313
This is a disaster. It's terrible.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.940
I feel as though
we are totally in sync on this.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.942
Yet another person who treats us

10:52.026 --> 10:55.196
like we're enfeebled and incompetent
and need to be saved.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.324
Right. But in this case,
he's super-saving us.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.743
-We got to get out of here.
-And go where?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.411
-To Nick's house.
-Gotcha.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.580
Not this one!

11:06.957 --> 11:08.125
Oh.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.378
[sighs]

11:10.461 --> 11:11.420
I knew that.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.800
What's the word?

11:15.883 --> 11:16.884
Okay.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.136
Arlene said they were both upset.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.596
Grace just broke up with Nick

11:20.680 --> 11:23.974
and Mom was incensed
that they confiscated her fondue pot.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.185
Well, to be fair,
she has weaponized it in the past.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.647
And she might again. Security footage
shows them leaving with the fondue pot

11:29.730 --> 11:32.233
-and a toaster and a blowtorch.
-What?!

11:32.316 --> 11:33.693
This makes no sense.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.445
Or... does it make perfect sense?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.948
Grace was upset because of the break-up,

11:39.031 --> 11:43.035
Mom wanted to cheer her up
with a fondue party, which isn't allowed,

11:43.119 --> 11:46.539
so they broke out to melt some cheese.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.168
Or... that isn't what happened
and they're missing

11:51.252 --> 11:54.088
-and we need to split up and find them.
-I think that's a good idea.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.631
We need to check
the all-night cheese barn.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.466
We should check the all-night booze barn.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.427
I think you're all overreacting.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.972
You can't go crazy every time
an old person doesn't answer their phone.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.349
Either we don't want to
or we don't know how.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.352
Well, sometimes we do
get stuck in dumbwaiters

12:08.436 --> 12:10.271
like Mr. Purcelli last month.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.982
You know, if my mom went missing,
I'd be worried sick.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.442
Exactly.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.611
-So...
-Roy.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.448
Roy. Of course. Um...

12:20.531 --> 12:22.908
How is it exactly
that you know our fathers?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.828
-We should go look for your mothers.
-We met on this cruise--

12:25.911 --> 12:27.288
-[Sol] Yes.
-Oh, I'll come help.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.290
No! No...

12:29.373 --> 12:32.251
He means, you stay here
in case they call or show up.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.669
-Done.
-Good.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.880
Then let's all go!
Come on. Everyone. Let's go.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.758
Okay, and I'll just stay back here
and chat with Roy.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.092
[Roy chuckles]

12:40.176 --> 12:41.886
-I'll tell you the rest of the story.
-Yeah!

12:41.969 --> 12:43.387
-So, we--
-Get in the goddamn car.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.890
Geez.

12:45.973 --> 12:46.974
Thank you, Roy.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.897
[Frankie]
Okay, this is crazy gorgeous.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.898
[elevator dings]

12:56.692 --> 12:59.236
Sir, would you mind hitting Penthouse?
Thank you.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.863
Fancy.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.156
[chuckles]

13:02.364 --> 13:04.366
He's got the entire top floor.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.037
Great, so he doesn't need to crash
at his new beach house.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.663
Ooh, wait, wait, wait!

13:20.007 --> 13:21.675
Roy seems... nice.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.594
Still not talking about it.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.972
Roy was more
of a late-in-life exploration than an act.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.808
I'd rather not know what that means.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.894
Well, Bud, what it means is that...

13:32.978 --> 13:35.231
Nothing? You can't tell us anything?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.942
I can tell you I never should've
defrosted that pork chop.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.610
I never heard that lingo before.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.403
So, who gave who the "go ahead"?

13:41.487 --> 13:44.323
-You know about the "go ahead"?
-I live in the world, Dad.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.034
And I wanna live in any other world
than the one in this car.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.536
Can I just ask you one question?

13:48.619 --> 13:51.121
Are you spending
my inheritance on a prostitute?

13:51.205 --> 13:55.000
Roy... is a folk-loving friend

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
who turned out to be a sensualist.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.255
Can we please stop talking about this
and focus on Mom?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.590
-Yes... of course.
-[Bud sighs]

14:02.216 --> 14:03.050
[Bud sighs]

14:03.133 --> 14:06.262
Truth be told,
your mother was also a sensualist.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.223
[Grace] How can you be pissed
at the kids and not at Nick?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.600
Because this is nothing like the kids!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.269
They railroaded us.

14:13.352 --> 14:17.940
Nick was the one and only person
who said you shouldn't be in that place.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.193
And he knows how much
you loved that house.

14:21.277 --> 14:25.614
And if you ask me, buying it for you
was pretty dang romantic.

14:26.407 --> 14:30.369
Yeah, actually, it's the most romantic
thing anybody ever did for me.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.122
Oh, God, I must look like hell.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.540
How's my hair?

14:34.623 --> 14:37.626
Um, ideally, you would've
one of those cute cloches

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
-like the flappers wore.
-[scoffs]

14:39.295 --> 14:41.589
Here. Would you hold that for a second?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.011
Here.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.304
Excuse me?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.222
She needs it more than you do.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.393
I love that shade.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.395
Thanks.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.230
-No, thank you. [chuckles]
-[elevator dings]

14:58.689 --> 14:59.523
[elevator door opens]

15:00.190 --> 15:01.191
[sighs]

15:01.775 --> 15:02.610
Here.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.113
Sorry, did you ladies forget
to press your floor?

15:06.196 --> 15:09.909
We're going to the penthouse.
You know, friends in high places.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.535
[clang]

15:12.077 --> 15:15.039
Oh, so I guess this isn't a date.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.208
With Nick?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.418
Yeah. [chuckles]

15:20.044 --> 15:22.671
I didn't realize he called me
to come to a party.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.256
[elevator dings]

15:30.346 --> 15:31.347
Aren't you coming?

15:31.889 --> 15:34.391
No. We're... [clears throat]
going down.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.357
[Robert] I don't see them here either.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.525
I hope they're okay.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.569
I know, we should get a drink.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.112
I'm on it. Martinis?

15:47.905 --> 15:48.739
Please.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.077
God. I have needed one
since we saw all of Roy.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.998
Okay. My 75-year-old dad
is in a <i>thruple</i> with a porn handyman

15:58.082 --> 16:00.876
and I'm in a relationship
with a cardigan that does math.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.379
-Okay, first, Barry's adorable.
-It doesn't feel good.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.797
In certain cardigans.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.924
Second, at least you and Dad
are getting some.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.176
I'm the only one
with no sex life in this family.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.596
Please stop complaining about this
and do something.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.847
Like what?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.892
Like update your status already.
It's time to change it to "single."

16:16.976 --> 16:19.311
But then everyone would know
that I failed at my marriage.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.605
Well, everyone
whose status is "single" has failed.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.649
Dad, I found Mom.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.901
To Mom.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
[sighs] To Mom.

16:33.033 --> 16:37.121
Look, we've got
the Macho Combo Burrito for you,

16:37.204 --> 16:41.125
a jacked-up Value-Beans-Rice-and-Cheese
Burrito for me,

16:41.667 --> 16:44.378
Queso Loaded Nachos for the table.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.089
How could I be so stupid?

16:48.173 --> 16:51.719
How could I possibly think a man
I broke up with is gonna buy me a house?

16:51.802 --> 16:55.514
Well, it's not so much stupid...
as it is vain.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.765
[scoffs] You're right.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.601
I'm thinking he's thinking of me, when...

17:00.436 --> 17:03.105
all he's thinking about is moving on.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.734
Well, he sure didn't waste any time,
did he?

17:06.817 --> 17:08.235
We only broke up today.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.364
Well, you did kind of break up with him,
like, 14 times.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.616
And you did move without telling him.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.287
But let's not draw on facts.
They're so over.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.873
What about the fact
that we don't have any place to go?

17:20.956 --> 17:23.500
There's always Walden Villas, I guess.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.793
Oh, be honest.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.129
Can you ever see us being happy there?

17:27.212 --> 17:28.672
I know.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.925
It felt so great, didn't it,
when we broke out of that place?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.177
What a mess.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.636
That, it is.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.221
[sighs]

17:43.562 --> 17:44.396
Mm.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.024
My, oh my!

17:47.107 --> 17:48.067
Good, right?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.320
[choking up]
I've never felt this way before.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.322
Welcome to Del Taco.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.490
Oh.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.449
[laughs]

17:55.532 --> 17:58.494
Nothing. We've searched
every cheese shop that's open.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.953
Is this our life now?

18:00.037 --> 18:02.206
The roles are reversed,
we're constantly worried about them?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.166
You're being a little dramatic.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.210
-Maybe they're having a great time.
-[cell phone rings]

18:06.293 --> 18:09.296
I mean, people rarely steal a golf cart
if they're in peril.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.340
-I'm Bud.
-Robert's right.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.301
I'm sure they're fine
and you'll hear from them very soon.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.262
-You're right, Sol. We should go home.
-Hmm.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.140
I'm sure you have a lot to do at home.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.851
-I'm talking about the naked man.
-[Robert] I'm not!

18:25.521 --> 18:26.730
[sighs]

18:28.148 --> 18:29.358
Now what do we do?

18:29.566 --> 18:33.779
We could... keep drinking and talk
about your new relationship status.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.614
You didn't.

18:35.697 --> 18:39.868
-Uh, duh. Of course I did.
-How did you know my password?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.912
It's always the name of your last kid.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.789
How did you know the name of my last kid?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.457
I mean, I had a couple failed attempts.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.375
[chuckles]

18:47.042 --> 18:48.043
You're single.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.169
[sighs]

18:50.045 --> 18:51.046
Fuck.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
That was the security guard
from Walden Villas.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.094
They found the golf cart
abandoned at La Jolla Shores.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.930
-Why would it be at La Jolla Shores?
-Because it's down the beach--

19:00.013 --> 19:02.057
Oh, my God, they went to the house.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.603
Can I get this to go?

19:06.687 --> 19:09.314
I think I finally understand
emotional eating.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.775
-The Del is here for you, my friend.
-[Grace chuckles]

19:11.859 --> 19:15.320
I'll be back in a jiff
with two cinnamon churros

19:15.404 --> 19:18.240
and four caramel cheesecake bites.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.158
What do you want?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.286
I wanna go home.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.996
I know, me too.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.914
We'll figure out a way.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.296
Aw. Well, another new face.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.923
-Welcome. I'm Frankie.
-I'm Bob.

19:35.007 --> 19:35.841
Ah.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.511
You go away a couple of months
and it all changes.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.721
You feel me, Bob?

19:40.804 --> 19:42.306
Uh...

19:42.389 --> 19:46.643
Okay, two cinnamon churros
and four caramel cheesecake bites.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.147
Two cinnamon churros
and four caramel cheesecake bites to go.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.356
No, not to go.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.275
We have no place to go.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.819
Uh, but the dining room is closed.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.615
No, the dining room closes at 10:00.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.992
It's only 9:52.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.536
-Right, but since there's no one here--
-We're here.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.079
Do you not see us, Bob?

20:06.872 --> 20:07.956
Are we not here?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.751
No, of course, ma'am,
but it's almost 10:00, so--

20:10.834 --> 20:14.254
So, you're just gonna throw us
out on the street, kick us to the curb?

20:14.338 --> 20:17.507
Have Terry from the kitchen
physically remove us?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.509
-Uh... I don't--
-Is Craig here?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.387
Is Jacinda here?

20:22.471 --> 20:25.390
Could you get one of them
on the phone for me, please?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.643
Craig is taking his SATs tomorrow.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.937
Frankie, we don't need any dessert.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.688
You're wearing enough food as it is.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.941
This is not just about dessert, Grace!

20:34.024 --> 20:37.110
This is about something
much bigger than dessert!

20:37.194 --> 20:38.946
But it's also about dessert!

20:39.029 --> 20:40.656
Why are you getting so upset?

20:40.739 --> 20:44.451
They're trying to throw us out of here
and we are not ready to leave.

20:44.534 --> 20:48.872
So, we are not leaving until we decide
that it's time for us to go!

20:49.581 --> 20:52.793
Yes, ma'am. [chuckles]
And you stay as long as you like.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.504
Your Del Taco family's here for you.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.384
Wow. [chuckles]

21:00.467 --> 21:03.804
Sometimes you just have to say
"fuck it" and refuse to leave.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.306
Frankie, you're a genius.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.143
I've been waiting for you
to realize that.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.438
Why am I a genius?

21:13.522 --> 21:17.776
I think the problem is Roy doesn't get
what we're trying to do as gay men.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.988
The other problem is we don't really get
what we're trying to do.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.075
I just want to know,
when we invite people over for dinner,

21:25.158 --> 21:26.743
their clothes are staying on.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.038
Well, we can't keep going
around and around with Roy.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.790
It's not fair to him...

21:32.708 --> 21:34.459
and it's not us.

21:36.086 --> 21:40.966
I guess
we're just boring, traditional guys.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.135
But I kind of like that about us.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.928
I love that about us!

21:45.012 --> 21:50.475
Some people need to get
their excitement from a three-way

21:50.559 --> 21:53.895
and other people get it
from a new Audible book.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.981
And we know who we are.

21:56.064 --> 22:01.445
So... we have to tell Roy
we just can't see him anymore.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.572
-You should do it.
-It's better if you do--

22:06.283 --> 22:07.743
Rock-paper-scissors?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.422
[car door clicks]

22:20.756 --> 22:22.716
[Coyote grunts]

22:27.971 --> 22:30.766
Well, it looks like they were here.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.768
[Mallory sighs]
Okay.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.102
Huh.

22:36.813 --> 22:37.647
Excuse me, sir?

22:38.732 --> 22:39.858
Who's this for?

22:40.942 --> 22:44.321
-"Ray Donovan and Eleanor Roosevelt".
-They're here.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.035
You don't have to worry about this.
It's fine.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.040
Hoo.

22:55.832 --> 22:56.792
All right, let's go.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.054
[whispers] What a shame to wake him.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.516
Maybe we should wait until morning?

23:12.599 --> 23:15.977
I don't even want to think about
what we might see in the morning.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.563
Come on, let's do it together.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.775
[Robert sighs]

23:26.113 --> 23:27.322
[Robert clears throat]

23:29.282 --> 23:31.201
Uh... Roy?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.120
[Sol] Roy?

23:34.162 --> 23:37.040
Oh! You're not Roy.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.836
-I was for, like, a week in college.
-Where is he?

23:40.919 --> 23:45.465
He said, "Sorry for the misunderstanding,"
and left when I got here.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.300
So what are you doing here?

23:47.384 --> 23:48.552
I-- Uh...

23:50.011 --> 23:51.513
I'll tell you in the morning.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.272
[door closes]

24:10.240 --> 24:11.658
Uh, Mom?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.495
Oh, Jesus.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.832
Kids, what a... pleasant surprise.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.126
[Frankie] Don't just stand there.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.627
Bud, pay the man.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.299
Um...

24:28.467 --> 24:29.718
What are you guys doing?

24:30.218 --> 24:33.096
We're having
a nice, quiet evening at home.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.764
This is not your home anymore.

24:35.348 --> 24:38.226
Yeah, and thanks for telling us that, BTW.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.563
-BTY?
-No, you had it.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.689
Don't doubt yourself.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.775
-The house just sold.
-Just!

24:45.859 --> 24:47.861
-We were going to tell you.
-Soon.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.571
We thought this is what you wanted.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.781
And you didn't want to deal with it.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.366
Isn't it why you gave us
power of attorney?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.826
We have seller's remorse.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.121
I know that because you sold it
and now we're remorseful.

24:58.914 --> 25:02.000
Look, Mom, we talked to Arlene.
We know that you're upset about Nick--

25:02.083 --> 25:06.004
Uh-uh. No, I'm upset
because you all manipulated us.

25:06.087 --> 25:09.841
Yeah, why don't you take us into
separate rooms and have your way with us--

25:09.925 --> 25:13.553
And that didn't come out right.
I know that, but you get the point!

25:13.637 --> 25:15.514
We didn't manipulate you!

25:15.597 --> 25:17.307
We convinced you.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.435
And does it matter? Sometimes
you got to do what you got to do.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.230
Especially when you're worried
about your mom

25:23.313 --> 25:26.650
who happens to be sitting inside
on outside chairs

25:26.733 --> 25:31.112
in a house that she doesn't even own
with a toaster but no electricity!

25:33.073 --> 25:34.449
We have a blowtorch.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.368
Oh, you've got a blowtorch.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.412
Okay, then all seems well here.
We should go, guys.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.539
We really should.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.500
We're breaking the law
just by being in here. Come on. Now!

25:43.583 --> 25:46.461
-Mom--
-No! We're not going anywhere.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.964
-What do you mean?
-We're not leaving here again.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.090
But you have to!

25:50.173 --> 25:52.467
Ask Bob at Del Taco what we have to do.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.387
We're having ourselves
a nice, old-fashioned squat.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.305
We are taking our house back.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.933
-No, that is ridiculous.
-Are you insane, Mom?

26:00.016 --> 26:01.560
[Mallory] Seriously, what are you doing?

26:01.643 --> 26:03.520
No, this is so ridiculous.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.606
[meditative vocalizing]

26:08.024 --> 26:09.859
Now that we have your attention.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.112
-Out!
-[Grace] Go on.

26:12.195 --> 26:13.738
What? Mom?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.949
-That's hurtful.
-She spanked me.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.200
I bruise easily.

26:17.284 --> 26:21.871
You know, Mom, we went to Walden Villas
today to throw a surprise party for you.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.499
And, for what it's worth,
you're officially alive.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.500
[chuckles]

26:25.584 --> 26:27.419
You bet your ass I am.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.588
Glad you're getting off on this,
but it won't change a thing.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.424
-Even if you could get this place back...
-And you can't--

26:32.507 --> 26:34.801
...you'd still have
the same problems you had before.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.928
It's only getting worse from here.
You know that.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.015
You could make a good case
that it's already worse.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.309
What are you going to do if you fall?

26:42.392 --> 26:45.729
Or if one of you has a stroke?
What's the plan?

26:45.812 --> 26:48.064
Yeah, I got to say
it doesn't make a lot of sense.

26:50.984 --> 26:51.943
Fuck it.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.324
Excuse me?

26:58.533 --> 27:00.035
-Hey...
-[Coyote] Yeah.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.247
-[Mallory] We're just leaving them here?
-[Bree] I guess so.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.751
I mean, they don't have toothpaste
or toothbrushes, but okay.

27:10.086 --> 27:13.298
[Downtown Boys' "A Wall" playing]

27:18.928 --> 27:19.971
Fuck it.
