00:01.213 --> 00:02.202
Previously on Angel:

00:02.373 --> 00:04.841
- Fred disappeared five years
ago. They never found her.

00:05.013 --> 00:07.083
-  Cordy's been sucked into the portal.

00:07.293 --> 00:08.567
-  They use you as a slave.

00:08.773 --> 00:10.001
Handsome man...

00:10.213 --> 00:12.010
... saved me from the monsters.

00:12.333 --> 00:13.846
So we know each other?

00:14.013 --> 00:15.685
Yeah. Really well.

00:15.853 --> 00:17.730
-  Not to sound all
movie-of-the-week...

00:17.933 --> 00:20.652
...but I think you might
have some kind of amnesia.

00:20.853 --> 00:24.243
I think there's a way we might be
able to sort this out. Pick a song.

00:24.453 --> 00:26.842
- So Lorne can read you.
- You sing, he sees your future.

00:30.453 --> 00:31.806
Great! Enough.

00:32.012 --> 00:33.446
- What did you see?
- Go away.

00:33.613 --> 00:35.490
If it's that bad, I need to know.

00:35.653 --> 00:36.847
It's that bad.

00:37.053 --> 00:41.444
Evil's coming, Angel, and
it's planning on staying.

00:42.093 --> 00:45.449
You're sure that it's her? Put
an extraction team together.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.127
- Wolfram and Hart are
planning to extract Cordelia.

00:48.293 --> 00:50.284
And I doubt your boy
will be able to stop them.

00:54.213 --> 00:55.885
We should probably get you back home.

00:56.053 --> 00:58.806
Actually, I'd like to stay here...

00:59.253 --> 01:01.130
...with Connor.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.332
- Oh, my God.
- Lorne?

01:04.053 --> 01:06.169
- Is he alive?
- Who did this?

01:06.853 --> 01:08.445
- Wolfram and Hart.
- But why?

01:08.613 --> 01:10.126
They must know Lorne read her.

01:10.293 --> 01:13.091
They were after what
Lorne saw when she sang.

01:13.293 --> 01:15.170
- You played me.
- Freewill. Look it up.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.449
- Lilah...
- You're the one who decided to take...

01:17.613 --> 01:19.843
...what you overheard
to the good and plentys.

01:20.053 --> 01:22.851
- How much did they get?
- All of it.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.521
That's my girl!

01:35.933 --> 01:39.892
- All right, let me check it out.
- Page 19. It's not a big article.

01:40.053 --> 01:43.204
- Not like it's featured or anything.
- Got it. "Super Symmetry...

01:43.373 --> 01:45.933
- and P
-Dimensional Subspace, by Winifred Burkle."

01:47.893 --> 01:49.087
You don't have to read it.

01:49.293 --> 01:51.409
Of course I'm gonna read it, right now.

01:53.213 --> 01:56.922
"In multidimensional
superstring theory...

01:57.093 --> 02:00.529
...distance scales
inverted by T-duality...

02:00.693 --> 02:04.083
...apply to heterotic theories."

02:04.253 --> 02:07.962
The pictures are nice.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.810
Give it to me, sweetness. Right there.

02:22.973 --> 02:24.725
-  Here you go.

02:26.453 --> 02:28.364
- How's your head?
- Smashing.

02:28.573 --> 02:31.451
Listen, I know I've been a bit
jumpy the last couple of days...

02:31.613 --> 02:35.845
...but did I hear a scream?
- It's just Fred. I think it's a Texas thing.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.605
Well, it's all too much Sturm
und Drang for my appetite.

02:41.253 --> 02:44.370
Cordelia shacking up with
your hellspawn. No offense.

02:45.653 --> 02:48.963
- And the hole between my horns.
- And you're probably a little on edge...

02:49.133 --> 02:52.284
...because of the whole,
"slouching toward Bethlehem" thing.

02:52.533 --> 02:54.091
No.

02:54.253 --> 02:57.768
- No? That's good because...
- Sorry, I jumped ahead.

02:57.933 --> 03:01.403
That "no" was the one that comes after
you asking me to read Cordy again.

03:01.573 --> 03:05.646
I wasn't gonna ask you that immediately.
I was gonna build up to it subtly.

03:05.813 --> 03:09.328
I appreciate that, sugar pie,
really. But the answer's no.

03:09.533 --> 03:13.128
I'm not a champion, I'm just a regular
old karaoke-singing empath demon.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.403
You saw something. If
we knew what it was...

03:15.573 --> 03:17.848
Yeah, Wolfram and Hart
would come after me again.

03:18.013 --> 03:20.811
And maybe they wouldn't stop
with a little gray matter.

03:20.973 --> 03:22.201
-  I'm listening.

03:22.413 --> 03:24.608
Hey, death just doesn't look good on me.

03:24.773 --> 03:27.810
I wish I could tell you what
was coming and when, but...

03:31.333 --> 03:34.052
When you say listening,
you don't mean to me.

03:34.773 --> 03:36.445
You heard something, didn't you?

03:37.093 --> 03:39.243
It's probably just Fred.

03:40.813 --> 03:42.485
-  I got your back.

04:24.213 --> 04:26.124
Oh, hi.

04:27.173 --> 04:28.765
Sorry.

04:29.213 --> 04:31.090
I'm used to it.

04:33.253 --> 04:36.643
Front door is always open,
Connor. You don't have to sneak in.

04:37.053 --> 04:39.328
Cordy wanted some of her stuff.

04:41.493 --> 04:44.166
How's she doing, Cordy?
Anything coming back to her?

04:44.333 --> 04:46.403
Nothing about you.

04:47.533 --> 04:52.243
- Is she alone right now? Because...
- She's safe. I can take care of Cordelia.

04:53.493 --> 04:54.892
Can I go?

04:55.853 --> 04:58.128
Sure. Sorry.

05:00.693 --> 05:02.285
Wait.

05:03.693 --> 05:06.366
You should take her fuzzy slippers.

05:07.053 --> 05:09.613
- Her feet get cold.
- I know.

05:09.813 --> 05:12.202
She's always stealing the covers.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.328
Super Symmetry

06:18.133 --> 06:20.328
-  You don't wanna go in there.

06:22.613 --> 06:27.129
Girl kept me up all
night. She is unstoppable.

06:28.093 --> 06:29.412
More than I need to know.

06:29.573 --> 06:31.370
Did Charles tell you?

06:31.573 --> 06:32.688
He didn't describe it.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.771
I've been asked to present my
article at the Physics Institute.

06:35.933 --> 06:38.652
P-Dimensional subspace has
always been a fascinating area...

06:38.853 --> 06:41.128
...but I had no idea
there'd be so much interest.

06:41.813 --> 06:43.690
Can I practice my speech for you?

06:43.853 --> 06:47.050
I think Lorne's a little conked. Okay.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.883
Oh, yay. We're back.

06:51.093 --> 06:55.086
That, all night. Well, mostly that.

06:55.293 --> 06:57.170
I didn't know Fred
was back into physics.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.130
I don't think she wanted anyone to know.

06:59.293 --> 07:03.286
- Think she was afraid she lost the knack.
- She seems over that.

07:06.613 --> 07:10.049
It's nothing big, really. Just a little
breakthrough in quantum particles.

07:10.253 --> 07:12.562
Emphasis on little.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.122
Probably be disproven in no time.

07:17.013 --> 07:21.848
It's just, I used to dream I'd discover
some revolutionary concept and...

07:22.533 --> 07:25.127
- Oh, it's silly.
- Doesn't sound silly.

07:26.373 --> 07:29.888
I guess I just wanted all
those people I looked up to...

07:30.053 --> 07:32.886
...I wanted them to see me too.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.809
And then I got sucked
into Pylea and, well...

07:36.973 --> 07:40.170
...when you're a cow-slave, you
don't want anyone to see you at all.

07:40.373 --> 07:42.523
Everybody will be watching you now.

07:45.693 --> 07:47.809
I gotta practice.

07:48.653 --> 07:50.450
You'll be there?

07:50.653 --> 07:52.848
Cheering you on. Right?

07:56.653 --> 08:00.487
The little nipper dropped in
for a midnight visit last night.

08:00.693 --> 08:03.412
- Connor was here?
- Hope he didn't wanna kiss and make...

08:03.573 --> 08:05.450
He picked up some of Cordelia's things.

08:07.373 --> 08:10.843
She's just trying to put
the pieces back together.

08:11.053 --> 08:13.726
It'll work out, and
it'll all be for the best.

08:15.573 --> 08:16.801
It will!

08:16.973 --> 08:21.410
Five years of unendurable torture aside,
if I hadn't been sucked through a portal...

08:21.573 --> 08:24.770
...I wouldn't have figured out
my string compactification theory.

08:24.933 --> 08:28.164
Exactly. Because, you
know, strings need...

08:28.333 --> 08:30.324
...to compactify.

08:45.493 --> 08:49.930
- Surprise.
- Oh, look. A bribe. How thoughtful.

08:51.173 --> 08:54.882
No, it can't be a
bribe. Must be a setup.

08:56.813 --> 08:59.771
Can't it just be a gift?

09:02.653 --> 09:04.052
Open it.

09:14.173 --> 09:19.008
We seem to be butting heads lately.
Now you'll have the advantage.

09:20.453 --> 09:23.570
- This must have cost a fortune.
- Yes.

09:24.973 --> 09:30.172
It'll take you hours
to thank me properly.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.246
Fortunately...

09:39.413 --> 09:41.847
...I've taken the afternoon off.

09:44.093 --> 09:46.323
I have to leave, actually.

09:52.053 --> 09:54.089
But thank you, Lilah...

09:54.493 --> 09:56.165
...for the gift.

10:29.613 --> 10:31.126
There.

10:31.293 --> 10:33.045
Almost done.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.404
- Connor?
- Yeah?

10:41.573 --> 10:43.803
How come there's no picture of Angel?

10:44.853 --> 10:46.332
Uh...

10:46.493 --> 10:48.245
Didn't see any.

10:48.533 --> 10:52.811
Oh. Well, it's okay. You got
all the other important stuff.

10:53.373 --> 10:54.806
Apparently, I'm a nester...

10:54.973 --> 10:58.363
...because this place is starting
to look not entirely unhomey.

11:10.573 --> 11:13.292
- What?
- Nothing.

11:15.373 --> 11:17.011
Except...

11:18.093 --> 11:21.290
...well, I thought I'd feel different.

11:21.493 --> 11:26.931
I mean, I have my pictures and slippers
and superluscious peau de soie blouse...

11:27.893 --> 11:31.408
...but why does it still
feel like something's missing?

11:46.613 --> 11:50.208
- How does that feel?
- Uh, woodsy.

11:51.813 --> 11:56.091
Maybe you miss the action.
The thrill of the kill.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.722
You know, you used to be a demon hunter.

11:58.893 --> 12:01.248
It's true. You're just out of practice.

12:01.413 --> 12:03.483
It'll come back fast, though.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.324
I can train you.

12:08.693 --> 12:10.331
What should I wear?

12:13.413 --> 12:15.005
Thank you.

12:15.413 --> 12:18.086
At least I remember the uniform.

12:18.293 --> 12:22.525
- All these people here to see you?
- I'm just a minor speaker.

12:22.693 --> 12:25.002
Oh, God!

12:25.213 --> 12:28.967
I'm between Ed Witten and Brian Greene?

12:31.133 --> 12:33.693
Think Nomar Garciaparra and Sammy Sosa.

12:34.573 --> 12:37.087
Fred skipped the minors and
went straight to the show.

12:37.293 --> 12:39.204
Somebody must've made a mistake.

12:39.413 --> 12:44.168
Listen up. All that stuff about particles
and stuff, it's gonna blow them away.

12:44.333 --> 12:48.167
- Nothing to worry about.
- Well, what if my theory's wrong?

12:48.333 --> 12:51.291
- Professor Seidel!
- Winifred.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.211
Laurie, I'll meet you back at the lab.

12:57.533 --> 13:00.684
There you are. It's been,
what, two years or so.

13:00.853 --> 13:06.291
Yeah, heavy on the or so.
Wow, it is great to see you.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.172
Are you gonna be in there?

13:09.853 --> 13:10.888
I'm introducing you.

13:11.053 --> 13:14.329
I had to arm-wrestle the chair
of the department for the honor.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.687
Oh.

13:15.893 --> 13:19.522
Winifred, you have done some great work.

13:19.693 --> 13:22.127
You don't have anything to worry about.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.085
- Ahem.
- Oh.

13:24.293 --> 13:26.443
These are my friends Charles and Angel.

13:26.613 --> 13:27.841
Hey.

13:28.053 --> 13:31.682
I was gonna be a history major, then I
took Professor Seidel's physics class...

13:31.853 --> 13:34.811
...and, well...
- Winifred's a natural.

13:35.013 --> 13:37.652
By the end of the first
semester, she was taking on WIMPs.

13:37.813 --> 13:39.769
You should see her
now. Killer left hook.

13:41.293 --> 13:44.683
WIMPs are Weakly Interactive
Massive Particles.

13:45.213 --> 13:47.681
Oh, yeah. Just kidding.

13:47.853 --> 13:50.242
Do you remember that
Higgs Scalars tutorial?

13:50.453 --> 13:53.763
I still remember your take on
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

13:53.973 --> 13:58.091
You know, it's filling up.
I'm gonna go save some seats.

13:58.293 --> 14:01.524
Why don't you stop by the office.
I'd love to talk about your article.

14:01.693 --> 14:05.766
- Is tomorrow too soon?
- Tomorrow's perfect.

14:05.973 --> 14:10.205
I have some questions about how
Kaluza-Klein models fit with your theory.

14:10.373 --> 14:16.323
Oh, okay. Because string regularization
is kind of vital to what I'm proposing.

14:19.613 --> 14:21.126
Sorry about that.

14:35.093 --> 14:36.811
Oh, Dr. Shepard...

14:36.973 --> 14:39.851
...I want you to meet one of my
best students, Winifred Burkle.

14:40.013 --> 14:43.688
Of course. I read your article.
Intriguing. Nice to meet you.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.450
Listen, man, I'm gonna need
simultaneous translating on this thing.

14:48.613 --> 14:52.288
- But just give me the highlights.
- No problem.

14:52.453 --> 14:54.648
Of course, I have no idea
what she's talking about.

14:54.813 --> 14:58.362
Will you tell Fred? She thinks we're
both stupid, I won't stand out as much.

15:05.653 --> 15:10.010
There have been many recent
insights into string theory.

15:10.173 --> 15:15.452
But few have so elegantly tied
together the disparate threads...

15:15.613 --> 15:18.002
...as the one you will hear tonight.

15:18.173 --> 15:22.325
As a student, Winifred Burkle showed
outstanding intellectual rigor.

15:23.253 --> 15:26.370
Her work continues to exemplify...

15:26.533 --> 15:30.811
...the highest standard
of academic excellence.

15:31.573 --> 15:37.967
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
honor to introduce Winifred Burkle.

15:43.293 --> 15:45.568
Thank you, professor.

15:49.413 --> 15:52.052
This one just says, "open with joke."

15:52.213 --> 15:54.966
But I forgot to think of one.

15:55.133 --> 15:58.443
Of course, it's possible my
theory will take care of that.

16:01.173 --> 16:02.811
There are...

16:06.253 --> 16:09.802
There are several competing
dimensional theories.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.769
And while each provides
insights, physicists...

16:13.973 --> 16:16.043
...have long searched
for a unifying theory.

16:16.213 --> 16:19.922
One that can account for the behavior
of the smallest subatomic particles...

16:20.093 --> 16:22.004
...and the largest forces of nature.

16:22.213 --> 16:25.808
If space-time can undergo massive
rearrangement of its structure...

16:26.013 --> 16:28.652
...which I believe it can,
tearing and re-connecting...

16:28.813 --> 16:32.249
...according to a predetermined
disposition, then T-duality...

16:32.413 --> 16:35.962
...would allow for the compactification
of extra space dimensions.

16:36.173 --> 16:39.609
Consider the non-perturbative
properties of superstring theory...

16:39.773 --> 16:43.129
...in D-branes, especially as applied
to Dirichlet boundary conditions...

16:43.293 --> 16:45.853
...with dual open strings
that are T-transformed.

16:46.053 --> 16:48.123
This leads to the
conclusion that strings...

16:48.333 --> 16:50.608
...can only end in
P-dimensional... - Oh, my God!

16:59.373 --> 17:00.965
-  Fred! No!

17:09.093 --> 17:10.765
-  Fred!

17:15.853 --> 17:17.650
-  Hang on, baby. I got you!

17:22.292 --> 17:23.567
Hang on!

17:25.133 --> 17:26.361
-  Yeah...

17:26.573 --> 17:29.246
...vampire, strangling not gonna happen.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.131
It's over, baby. You're fine.

17:57.933 --> 18:01.084
That's cool. The top
just comes right off.

18:02.093 --> 18:05.449
Hey, if this is about the Jolly Green
Demon, I could've had him killed.

18:05.613 --> 18:07.922
- But do I hear a thank you?
- Before we get to that...

18:08.093 --> 18:11.165
...how about you tell me why a
portal happened to open over Fred...

18:11.333 --> 18:15.724
...right after you slithered out?
- Tragedy struck Gidget? Really?

18:15.933 --> 18:18.493
Did she go to that place
in the big Texas sky?

18:18.693 --> 18:21.412
Gunn and I took care of it.
But if we hadn't been there...

18:21.613 --> 18:25.083
...I'm sure your good friend
Wesley would've stepped right in.

18:25.253 --> 18:27.483
Come on. If I were
gonna kill the twig...

18:27.653 --> 18:29.848
...would I do it in a
room full of people...

18:30.013 --> 18:33.130
...and then make a conspicuous
getaway so I looked extra suspicious?

18:33.333 --> 18:36.723
Add videotape, sounds like
vintage Wolfram and Hart.

18:40.133 --> 18:42.283
Except somebody else
deserves the credit.

18:42.493 --> 18:43.846
You're quick.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.611
About Lorne, there's
gonna be a conversation.

18:49.813 --> 18:52.452
You know, Angel, coming from you...

18:52.613 --> 18:56.492
...idle threats are so, well, idle.

18:56.653 --> 18:59.451
You remember when I
ripped your car in half?

18:59.613 --> 19:02.002
Yeah, yeah. Hulk smash.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.607
-  Fred?

19:23.773 --> 19:26.333
-  P versus NP...

19:26.493 --> 19:30.532
...where NP is non-deterministic
polynomial time.

19:30.693 --> 19:32.843
Versus NP...

19:33.053 --> 19:34.691
...plus time...

19:34.853 --> 19:38.641
- Time spent.
- Never liked the paint in here.

19:38.813 --> 19:41.850
Yeah, let's redo the
place, really make it ours.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.285
I was just... I couldn't sleep.

19:48.173 --> 19:52.485
Fred. Demons, portals, that happens.

19:52.653 --> 19:55.406
Doesn't mean you're going back to Pylea.

19:55.773 --> 19:59.209
Every time I close my eyes, I see it.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.523
Like it's happening all over again.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.248
I know, baby.

20:03.413 --> 20:07.770
Five years of hiding in caves and
scrounging for food, wearing that collar.

20:08.413 --> 20:12.292
- You don't know! You couldn't.
- You're never going back to that place.

20:13.293 --> 20:15.568
- You're safe now.
- I was safe in the library...

20:15.733 --> 20:18.088
...until I opened that
book and read those words.

20:18.253 --> 20:22.041
- Then I hurtled through dimensions.
- Come back to bed, all right?

20:22.253 --> 20:26.531
- It'll all look different in the morning.
- Morning? As in tomorrow.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.445
Which as of now is today, which means...

20:28.613 --> 20:31.525
You're gonna talk to your professor
because nothing has changed.

20:31.693 --> 20:35.129
It has. He was there. He saw the...

20:35.293 --> 20:38.126
- He probably thinks...
- That you're brilliant, just like I do.

20:38.293 --> 20:40.443
He can't see me, not like this.

20:40.613 --> 20:43.332
There's nothing wrong with
you, like this or any other way.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.087
- To you, maybe.
- Look.

20:46.853 --> 20:48.571
Go, okay?

20:48.733 --> 20:52.362
Forget about all this, and talk
about strings and WIMPs and whatever.

20:52.533 --> 20:57.288
Angel and I'll take care of all
the demony portal stuff. No problem.

21:12.373 --> 21:15.365
Great. Our girl's not
the only one redecorating.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.162
You were there.

21:17.973 --> 21:19.247
Okay.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.932
What are we doing,
playing musical chairs?

21:28.253 --> 21:29.766
Nerdy guy.

21:29.973 --> 21:31.486
Older nerdy guy.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.891
Girl in black there.

21:37.093 --> 21:38.845
Okay, catching on, sort of.

21:39.693 --> 21:42.048
How come you never pulled
this parlor trick before?

21:42.253 --> 21:45.086
It's not an automatic reflex,
just kicked in when I saw Lilah.

21:46.173 --> 21:47.572
Hold up. Lilah was there?

21:47.733 --> 21:49.928
Not a huge leap thinking
she opened the portal.

21:54.093 --> 21:58.405
- She was just stalking Wesley.
- Wesley? He came to see...?

21:59.453 --> 22:02.013
- He was waiting.
- Wesley?

22:02.213 --> 22:05.046
Guy in the second row, center seat.

22:05.253 --> 22:07.687
A guy wearing a tan
T-shirt that said, "Thwak."

22:11.573 --> 22:13.370
He had a camera.

22:15.613 --> 22:18.889
- I think I know where to find him.
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on.

22:19.053 --> 22:20.725
Daylight. I need a coat.

22:20.893 --> 22:23.282
Well, get on it. Because
when my girl's not happy...

22:23.493 --> 22:25.211
I'm not happy!

22:25.813 --> 22:26.882
Is he gonna hurt me?

22:27.053 --> 22:29.442
Think Daredevil 181. I'm
Bullseye, you're Elektra.

22:29.613 --> 22:31.524
One wins, one dies. Get what I'm saying?

22:31.693 --> 22:34.332
Yeah, but we're kind of
crushing the Dark Horses.

22:35.973 --> 22:38.328
You were taking pictures
of my girlfriend. Why?

22:38.533 --> 22:39.932
The ceiling was ripping apart.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.890
Why were you there?

22:42.213 --> 22:45.046
I wanted to see if it was true.
If she was really one of them.

22:46.253 --> 22:48.608
You know, one of the
students who disappeared.

22:48.973 --> 22:50.486
One of?

22:50.813 --> 22:55.489
Pylea was a hell dimension,
actually. Not as bad as Quor-toth...

22:55.653 --> 22:58.292
...but if Angel and Gunn and
the rest hadn't rescued me...

22:58.453 --> 23:01.047
...I'd probably be dead by now.

23:01.493 --> 23:04.803
Winifred, I'm a theoretical physicist...

23:04.973 --> 23:08.807
...completely open to the idea
of other dimensions, but...

23:08.973 --> 23:10.247
...your naming them...

23:10.413 --> 23:15.965
I know. It took me a while to
believe it too, and I was there.

23:16.373 --> 23:18.682
You know Laurie Drummond, don't you?

23:18.853 --> 23:21.925
You were the TA for High Energy Physics.

23:22.093 --> 23:25.210
I still am. Not all of us are geniuses.

23:25.813 --> 23:27.531
I'd be lost without Laurie.

23:28.293 --> 23:29.521
Welcome back.

23:34.093 --> 23:37.005
I've been holding on
to something for you.

23:44.493 --> 23:46.563
The last test I took before...

23:48.613 --> 23:49.648
A-minus?

23:49.813 --> 23:52.452
Well, I would have given
another student an A-plus...

23:52.613 --> 23:55.525
...but with you, I had to
use a different standard.

23:56.373 --> 23:58.523
Now he tells me.

23:59.973 --> 24:03.932
I'd love another crack
at it. Teaching you.

24:04.413 --> 24:06.973
You have a gift. It shouldn't be wasted.

24:07.533 --> 24:12.891
It's been so long. I mean,
writing the article was great...

24:13.733 --> 24:15.246
...but I have another life now.

24:15.453 --> 24:19.241
Sounds like a life you stumbled
into, not one you chose.

24:20.213 --> 24:22.204
I guess it kind of chose me.

24:23.413 --> 24:26.803
You know, I don't know
what I saw yesterday.

24:28.253 --> 24:32.849
There are studies about subconscious
suggestion, mass hysteria.

24:33.413 --> 24:35.324
But I know what I see right now.

24:36.653 --> 24:37.802
You do?

24:38.413 --> 24:43.567
A talented young woman who deserves
to live in the world she was meant for.

24:48.533 --> 24:50.285
You guys know how it is.

24:50.453 --> 24:54.685
You hear things, but you don't
know if they really happened.

24:54.853 --> 24:57.572
Like the one about the girl,
the cat and the peanut butter.

24:57.733 --> 25:00.531
That one's true. Long story.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.291
Yeah, like, you're Angel, right?

25:02.693 --> 25:05.161
There are whole forums
on you in chat rooms, man.

25:05.613 --> 25:07.888
But who knew you
actually, like, existed?

25:08.493 --> 25:09.892
The disappearances?

25:10.853 --> 25:14.368
Supposedly there were three before
your girlfriend and one since.

25:14.573 --> 25:16.052
- What do you know?
- Just rumors.

25:16.253 --> 25:19.529
They were all science types.
These weren't everyday kidnappings.

25:19.733 --> 25:23.772
Hey, maybe I could help
you guys. Be your intern.

25:24.413 --> 25:27.962
We're full up on interns, but
the decoder ring's in the mail.

25:29.013 --> 25:31.083
They talk about me in the chatty rooms?

25:33.133 --> 25:37.251
You really should read
Quantum Cryptography.

25:38.373 --> 25:41.126
Professor Seidel, the
oscillator's tweaked again.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.005
I'll have a look.

25:43.693 --> 25:45.843
Would you write down
your numbers for me?

25:46.013 --> 25:49.050
I don't wanna lose track of
you for another six years.

25:49.573 --> 25:53.168
You laugh. I do have a system.

26:06.973 --> 26:10.602
Plasma and Fluid Turbulence
in with neutrino books?

26:10.773 --> 26:13.128
That's just wrong.

26:22.773 --> 26:25.924
- I'll meet you back at
4:00. I have some pressing...

26:36.693 --> 26:39.491
I don't like this, man.
I got a bad feeling. What?

26:39.653 --> 26:42.213
Here. The thing all those
students had in common.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.612
Oliver Seidel.

26:45.373 --> 26:47.887
As in, the guy she's with right now.

26:48.933 --> 26:51.447
Fred, there's something we
gotta tell you. The portal...

26:51.613 --> 26:53.046
It was Professor Seidel.

26:53.533 --> 26:54.522
Yeah.

26:55.333 --> 26:56.971
And he's done it before.

26:57.573 --> 27:00.007
- That's right. There are others.
- No.

27:00.893 --> 27:02.485
To me.

27:02.653 --> 27:05.326
He's the son of a bitch
that sent me to Pylea.

27:05.893 --> 27:07.292
What?

27:07.453 --> 27:10.729
- We're gonna get this guy.
- Count on it. He's gonna pay.

27:11.133 --> 27:12.566
No.

27:13.373 --> 27:15.443
He's gonna die.

27:20.293 --> 27:22.170
What do you mean, die?

27:22.453 --> 27:26.412
I don't know yet. But
it's gonna be about pain.

27:29.213 --> 27:30.566
The halberd could work.

27:30.973 --> 27:34.124
Acting like I'm all addle-brained,
talking about other dimensions.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.369
"Pylea? Never heard of it." Right.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.888
How about a flail-whipping?
Would that take long?

27:39.093 --> 27:43.211
Hours, if you do it right. Not
that you should do it at all.

27:44.213 --> 27:45.441
Ever.

27:46.013 --> 27:48.891
He's a killer, and he's just
sitting there, smiling...

27:49.053 --> 27:52.045
...telling me I'm so gifted
and how he wants to teach me.

27:52.213 --> 27:56.092
- Oh, there's gonna be a lesson, all right.
- All right, Fred, let's calm down.

27:56.293 --> 27:58.523
I idolized him, and he sent me to hell.

27:58.693 --> 28:01.332
Me and God knows how many
others who didn't make it back.

28:01.493 --> 28:03.768
So sure, I'll calm down. When he's dead.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.248
A few years ago I would've
done in the guy myself.

28:06.413 --> 28:08.369
But this? It isn't what we do.

28:08.533 --> 28:11.605
- We kill monsters every day.
- We help people.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.367
Fred, if you do this, the
demons you'll be living with...

28:14.533 --> 28:17.570
...won't be the horned kind. They'll
be the kind you can't get rid of.

28:17.773 --> 28:19.172
- You're wrong.
- He's right.

28:19.893 --> 28:23.010
Whatever you do now, it's nothing
compared to how it'd be afterward.

28:23.453 --> 28:26.172
- What you're saying goes
against everything you believe.

28:26.373 --> 28:30.286
Everything we believe in.
Fred, you idolized him...

28:30.453 --> 28:32.808
...but don't let him be
defining what you are now.

28:35.173 --> 28:37.243
Can I have the axe?

28:41.893 --> 28:43.929
I'm sorry, Charles.

28:44.733 --> 28:47.372
- I guess I kind of lost it.
- You want a drink?

28:47.573 --> 28:48.972
I can make you some cocoa.

28:49.533 --> 28:53.082
No, thanks. I'm just...

28:53.253 --> 28:57.292
...gonna go lay down for a few days.

29:02.013 --> 29:04.083
So, what are we gonna do to this guy?

29:04.253 --> 29:05.606
No idea.

29:06.333 --> 29:07.607
But let's do it fast.

29:07.893 --> 29:11.124
We gotta get to him before Fred
changes her mind because vengeance...

29:11.293 --> 29:12.362
...it can get ugly.

29:12.933 --> 29:16.084
Vengeance? Sounds good.

29:16.533 --> 29:19.491
Angel and Gunn want me to
be all sweetness and light.

29:19.653 --> 29:22.690
Cute little Fred, she'll turn
the other cheek like a good girl.

29:22.973 --> 29:25.612
I mean, they saw what
Professor Seidel is capable of.

29:25.773 --> 29:28.003
He opened that portal
right in front of them.

29:28.173 --> 29:30.562
You dealt with it handily enough.

29:31.053 --> 29:32.611
You were there?

29:32.773 --> 29:34.968
I read your article,
saw you'd be speaking.

29:35.253 --> 29:37.244
It was an excellent piece.

29:37.693 --> 29:41.572
Although I'm not sure I understand how
Pauli repulsion is so readily reversed.

29:43.613 --> 29:45.285
Layman's opinion.

29:46.373 --> 29:48.329
You've been keeping track of me.

29:49.853 --> 29:51.172
Yes.

29:51.853 --> 29:54.970
Well, about this Professor
Seidel. What did you have in mind?

29:55.173 --> 29:59.132
Beyond pain, I'm not really
sure. That's why I came to you.

30:03.453 --> 30:04.647
Fred...

30:04.813 --> 30:07.566
...you do know everything
Angel and Gunn told you is true.

30:08.413 --> 30:10.165
Vengeance will have a price.

30:11.013 --> 30:13.766
And once you've acted,
you can't go back.

30:14.933 --> 30:17.049
You have to live with
your actions forever.

30:18.493 --> 30:20.085
He's a serial killer.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.126
All right, then.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.088
I'm sure we'll find...

30:29.533 --> 30:32.206
...an appropriate solution.

30:41.853 --> 30:46.881
Oh, here's something interesting.
Once practiced in ancient Egypt.

30:47.253 --> 30:48.572
Is that his tongue?

31:04.213 --> 31:05.441
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

31:16.893 --> 31:18.008
Can I help?

31:18.853 --> 31:19.968
Ooh, that hurts!

31:26.773 --> 31:29.446
I did that. I did it.

31:29.613 --> 31:31.331
I did it!

31:43.173 --> 31:46.006
And I'm asking if she
wants cocoa. Stupid!

31:46.213 --> 31:47.646
She's gonna kill him.

31:48.013 --> 31:50.732
If he doesn't kill her first.
You know where she went.

31:50.933 --> 31:53.401
- Look, I'm faster on my own.
- Go. I'll meet you there.

31:53.573 --> 31:55.325
She'll be okay.

32:05.693 --> 32:09.652
- Remember everything we went over?
- I do.

32:09.813 --> 32:15.092
And I'm going to give him exactly
what he deserves. Thanks to you.

32:18.493 --> 32:19.812
What?

32:20.133 --> 32:22.169
I was just thinking.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.928
Not that I don't get his point...

32:25.373 --> 32:27.841
...but I'm surprised Gunn's not here.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.765
No matter what the consequences.

32:30.373 --> 32:32.682
Charles doesn't have it in him.

32:33.173 --> 32:35.289
It's part of what I love about him.

32:38.933 --> 32:42.448
You can still back out
if you think Gunn's right.

32:42.653 --> 32:44.962
It's not about what's right.

32:46.013 --> 32:47.571
Pull over there.

32:53.293 --> 32:55.249
I'd ask to tag along...

32:55.413 --> 32:57.210
But you know what the answer would be.

33:04.453 --> 33:08.446
- Going somewhere?
- No. No, I...

33:11.773 --> 33:15.925
I hear Pelican Bay's nice this time of
year. The inmates will love your lectures.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.089
- Get out of here.
- See, I can't do that.

33:18.253 --> 33:19.572
Fred's a friend of mine.

33:19.733 --> 33:22.611
And that little sabbatical you
had planned for her? Not nice.

33:22.813 --> 33:24.451
You don't have evidence. You can't...

33:24.653 --> 33:28.248
Oh, but I can. And when I'm done, I'm
guessing there's gonna be a full...

33:33.373 --> 33:34.886
Great.

33:41.533 --> 33:43.251
You know what they say about payback?

33:44.453 --> 33:46.808
Well, I'm the bitch.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.724
How about some more training?

34:07.973 --> 34:10.612
- Then tomorrow we can...
- Connor.

34:13.132 --> 34:14.327
We need to talk.

34:14.493 --> 34:16.563
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:19.973 --> 34:21.452
Sit down.

34:28.013 --> 34:31.527
About what happened earlier...

34:33.013 --> 34:36.005
The non-CPR
mouth-to-mouth.

34:36.213 --> 34:37.407
When you kissed me.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.252
Right.

34:40.013 --> 34:41.081
I shouldn't have.

34:41.493 --> 34:43.051
- But...
- Connor.

34:46.373 --> 34:47.601
I don't know who I am...

34:48.652 --> 34:51.326
...much less where I belong or who with.

34:51.493 --> 34:55.610
There's a picture over there when you
were a baby, it's only eight months old.

34:55.973 --> 34:58.726
There's a lot I need to figure out.

34:59.813 --> 35:01.166
I'm sorry.

35:04.733 --> 35:07.611
- So I'm gonna...
- You're going back to him.

35:07.933 --> 35:09.161
Aren't you?

35:13.893 --> 35:17.124
I just need some time to think, okay?

35:36.853 --> 35:38.764
Oh, man.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.686
What the...?

35:47.013 --> 35:48.162
Stay right there.

35:49.133 --> 35:50.646
Winifred.

35:51.253 --> 35:53.847
Fred, please...

35:55.093 --> 35:57.527
...let's talk about this.
- Talk?

35:58.013 --> 36:01.130
Sure, let's talk. Because
you gave me the chance to...

36:01.693 --> 36:03.490
Oh, wait. No, you didn't.

36:04.333 --> 36:08.565
- Oh, well, no talking.
- Fred, I know you.

36:08.893 --> 36:11.009
You're not capable of hurting anyone.

36:11.213 --> 36:13.807
You don't know me. Not anymore.

36:13.973 --> 36:18.330
Five years of pain in a hell dimension
will make a girl capable of a lot of things.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.210
Come on. I'm holding your head.

36:36.773 --> 36:40.561
It's funny thinking how threatened you
were by me when I was a grad student.

36:40.773 --> 36:42.729
That's why you sent
me and the others away.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.571
You couldn't handle the competition.

36:44.733 --> 36:47.088
- Fred.
- And that's why Laurie's still around.

36:47.253 --> 36:49.483
She's not smart enough
to overshadow you, is she?

36:49.653 --> 36:52.008
Not like me. I'm special.

36:52.173 --> 36:55.370
Special on a Pylean platter
with a side of you-make-me-sick!

36:55.533 --> 36:57.569
- Why don't you just let me...
- Go?

36:57.733 --> 37:00.008
Well, since you asked so nicely, sure.

37:00.573 --> 37:03.292
I've even practiced a goodbye speech.

37:11.213 --> 37:13.443
- Fred, no!
- Go away, Charles!

37:13.613 --> 37:15.808
You asked me not to
kill him, and I'm not.

37:15.973 --> 37:17.804
- Not exactly.
- Sure you are.

37:18.093 --> 37:19.651
No way he can survive that!

37:21.373 --> 37:23.329
Fred, don't let him do this to you!

37:23.493 --> 37:27.611
How dare you? You don't know!
You don't know what it was like!

37:29.853 --> 37:31.286
Please help me!

37:32.293 --> 37:35.126
I promise we'll stop him.
We'll find some other way.

37:35.333 --> 37:38.450
Fred! Winifred, please, help me!

37:38.653 --> 37:41.929
Don't you see? He'll never
stop. He'll do it again!

37:42.133 --> 37:44.363
If you kill him, I'm gonna lose you.

37:45.773 --> 37:47.889
Help me! Help me!

37:51.093 --> 37:52.208
Charles, no!

38:10.453 --> 38:12.444
What happened to the professor?

38:14.133 --> 38:15.851
It's taken care of.

38:27.413 --> 38:30.052
Sucked into his own portal.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.522
Wish I could have seen his face.

38:33.693 --> 38:36.332
Yeah. I'm gonna...

38:37.493 --> 38:38.972
-  Good night.

38:41.333 --> 38:42.482
Good night.

38:53.733 --> 38:55.007
Hi.

38:56.413 --> 38:57.482
Cordelia.

38:58.013 --> 38:59.412
Can we...?

39:16.733 --> 39:19.566
- You should have someone look at that.
- It'll be okay.

39:19.933 --> 39:23.050
Run-in with a Voynok demon.
Turns out they have nine lives.

39:23.213 --> 39:26.922
- Like a cat?
- Only less standoffish.

39:29.293 --> 39:31.170
We were friends.

39:31.653 --> 39:32.768
I know that.

39:34.933 --> 39:38.323
Not just from the pictures, but...

39:42.013 --> 39:45.926
And I know that's why you
lied before. To protect me.

39:46.973 --> 39:49.771
Well, l... I staked a vamp today.

39:49.933 --> 39:52.686
- Connor took you...?
- And what I realized is...

39:53.333 --> 39:55.847
...whoever I was before...

39:56.533 --> 39:58.205
...I'm still her.

39:59.253 --> 40:03.246
She didn't need protecting,
and neither do I.

40:04.533 --> 40:06.444
So no more lies.

40:07.413 --> 40:08.846
No more lies.

40:10.013 --> 40:11.332
Good.

40:11.653 --> 40:15.487
Because there's
something I need to know.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.971
Were we in love?
