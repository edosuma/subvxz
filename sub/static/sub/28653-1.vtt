10:43.559 --> 10:46.228
every Thursday and Fridaymorning at eight bells.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.522
That's nautical talkfor "8:00 a.m."

10:48.564 --> 10:49.732
Well, sadly, Miss Richards,

10:49.774 --> 10:51.567
I won't beyour skipper this summer.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.569
What? Why?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.029
Well, I decidedit was time

10:55.029 --> 10:57.406
to turn the helm overto someone younger,

10:57.448 --> 10:59.575
and I thoughtI'd come down here today

10:59.617 --> 11:01.077
to tell you that, well,

11:01.118 --> 11:03.037
the missus and Iare finally retiring

11:03.037 --> 11:04.747
and gonna travel a bit.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.042
That's wonderful,but we're going to miss you.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.543
Well, I'm gonnamiss you, too,

11:09.543 --> 11:12.880
but I sold the "Seagull"to a fellow Navy man,

11:12.922 --> 11:14.382
fine sailor,

11:14.423 --> 11:18.260
and I know he's gonna takeexcellent care of you all.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.596
Well, if he's gotyour seal of approval,

11:20.638 --> 11:22.515
I'm surewe'll be in good hands.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.726
Ahoy there!

11:26.894 --> 11:29.021
[♪♪]

11:31.482 --> 11:33.734
I thought you were a fisherman.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.277
Well, occasionally, I am,

11:35.319 --> 11:37.446
when I'm not losingall of my bait.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.657
So you know two each other?

11:39.698 --> 11:42.243
Oh, we met the other day.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.994
Well, I would sayit was more of a collision

11:44.036 --> 11:46.455
than an actual meeting.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.999
Well, now we can properly meet.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.584
I'm Tom Hastings,

11:50.584 --> 11:52.753
but you can call me Captain.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.088
Claire Richards,

11:54.130 --> 11:55.631
but you can call meMs. Richards,

11:55.673 --> 11:57.508
especially in frontof my students.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.760
Actually--

11:59.802 --> 12:01.137
Okay, everyone,

12:01.178 --> 12:02.680
a change of plans.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.182
Captain, um... Hastings,was it?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.977
Will be taking us outto the island for the month.

12:08.018 --> 12:08.936
That's right.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.521
Who's ready for an adventure?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.315
All right! If we headstraight to the bow,

12:13.357 --> 12:14.859
we can beginour safety walk-through.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.152
I don't know about you,

12:16.193 --> 12:17.903
but I can't focuson an empty stomach.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.989
If the kids like,we've prepared snacks,

12:20.030 --> 12:21.282
and they're waitingin the galley.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.074
Snacks?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.451
You don't like snacks?

12:23.451 --> 12:24.452
Of course, I love snacks.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.870
Everybody loves snacks,

12:25.911 --> 12:27.288
but we're ona bit of a schedule here.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.457
Well, we've gotstrong winds today.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.417
We'll make good time.Don't worry about it.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.003
Hmm. Okay, everybody.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.796
Let's get onboard.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.630
And get snacks!

12:39.049 --> 12:41.552
This is my first mate, Mick.He'll show you the way.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.097
Welcome.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.141
Hey.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.060
About yesterday...

12:50.102 --> 12:51.145
You know what?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.646
You don't need to apologize.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.731
[laughs]

12:53.773 --> 12:55.316
I, uh, I wasn'tgonna apologize.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.400
What?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.443
You ran into me.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.695
I saved youfrom falling into the water.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.072
Which I wouldn't have beenfalling into in the first place,

13:02.114 --> 13:03.199
if you hadn't run into me.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.159
And I lost a lot of bait.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.161
Yeah, onto my sweater.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.039
Yeah, and mine.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.292
Did you, uh, did you usethe baking soda?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.336
Yes, I did.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.378
Good.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.671
After you.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.507
Thank you.

13:22.718 --> 13:26.138
[♪♪]

13:46.033 --> 13:47.535
[indistinct conversations]

13:51.080 --> 13:52.289
All good here?

13:52.331 --> 13:55.209
We're all good. Jack, get down.We're good, thanks.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.545
Hey.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.550
You dropped this yesterday.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.261
I have beenlooking everywhere for this!

14:05.302 --> 14:06.262
Thank you.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.141
Did you really seea Higby's banded plover?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.561
You opened my notebook?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.896
Only to seewho it belonged to.

14:15.896 --> 14:16.897
I promise.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.649
You can ask Mick.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.276
And you just happened

14:20.317 --> 14:22.903
to see the part aboutHigby's banded plover?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.488
It caught my eye.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.449
Higby's banded plover?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.995
My father workedfor the military.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.913
We traveled quite a bit.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.874
Spent some timein New Zealand.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.292
My little brother and Iused to watch

14:36.333 --> 14:38.168
the plovers forageon the mud banks.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.087
I had no ideathere were any over here,

14:40.087 --> 14:42.798
and now, thanks to you,I do.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.220
They were a stapleof Blue Island for decades,

14:48.262 --> 14:50.764
but they haven't been seenon the island in over 50 years.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.602
So you're lookingfor a bird that hasn't been seen

14:54.602 --> 14:57.396
in over 50 years.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.939
Why?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.482
Because...

15:00.524 --> 15:03.235
sometimes, things come back.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.533
[♪♪]

15:17.416 --> 15:18.459
When I was child,

15:18.500 --> 15:21.045
my parents and Iused to sail out here.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.632
My mother was a teacher.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.967
She was my first,and she was my best.

15:27.009 --> 15:27.968
I'm gonna take you all

15:27.968 --> 15:30.179
on a guided hikearound the island,

15:30.220 --> 15:31.639
and I want youto keep your eyes open

15:31.639 --> 15:34.808
for as many different typesof wildlife as you can spot.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.810
You should each startthinking about a project

15:36.810 --> 15:39.313
to count and studythe different species

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
that inhabit Blue Island,

15:41.106 --> 15:44.151
and your research needsto be sound and scientific.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.694
Everybody ready?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.987
[students, overlapping]Yeah.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.325
One of my favorite thingsabout Blue Island

15:51.367 --> 15:53.827
is that you can spend daysand days out here

15:53.869 --> 15:57.331
without ever running intoanother living soul.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.832
Except today?

16:01.126 --> 16:03.170
Oh. Um...

16:03.170 --> 16:04.672
Excuse me?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.090
Uh, what are you doing?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.591
Surveying.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
I'm a surveyor.It's what I do.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.095
Ha. Very funny.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.179
The island is city-owned.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.972
Belongs to the townof Willow Bay.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.724
Until someone buys it.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.269
Well, they can't buy it,because it's not for sale.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.771
Might be...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.856
if I can ever finish my survey.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.857
What are you talking about?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.109
Well, town council

16:25.150 --> 16:27.695
is considering sellingBlue Island for development.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.862
That's impossible.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.698
They need the moneyfor municipal improvements,

16:30.698 --> 16:32.032
and they think the islandis underutilized.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.076
Of course it's underutilized!

16:34.118 --> 16:35.202
That's the whole point.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.372
Hello?

16:38.372 --> 16:40.207
Excuse me,I wasn't quite done.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.292
Ma'am, excuse me.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.215
They're selling Blue island?

16:48.257 --> 16:49.216
Mm-hmm.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.592
The surveyorwouldn't tell me much,

16:50.634 --> 16:52.386
but he mentionedthe "R" word.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.762
Roads?

16:53.804 --> 16:56.557
Mm-mm. Resort.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.517
I thought that landwas protected.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.768
No.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.894
No, it's always beenthe town's choice

17:00.894 --> 17:02.354
to just leave it alone,

17:02.396 --> 17:05.733
but it's always been such a bigpart of Willow Bay's identity.

17:05.773 --> 17:07.984
Well, I'm surprised you didn'thead straight to city hall

17:08.027 --> 17:09.737
the moment you got backonto the mainland,

17:09.778 --> 17:11.238
to talk to Councilman Haines.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.740
Oh, I did, but he was out.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.409
I made an appointment, though.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.410
He can't avoid me.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.079
Speaking of people to avoid...

17:19.079 --> 17:21.665
Mark ran into Jason today.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.835
Well, it's kind of inevitable.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.920
He was invitedto Amber's wedding, too.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.756
Have you talked to him yet?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.424
I haven't seen him.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.427
I'm still trying to figure outwhat to say when I do.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.804
Any ideas?

17:35.846 --> 17:38.932
[Claire sighs]

17:38.974 --> 17:40.476
Honestly?

17:40.517 --> 17:43.937
I just want to scream out,"Give us another chance!"

17:43.937 --> 17:45.272
You can't do that.

17:45.314 --> 17:50.652
I know, but that's how I feel.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.697
I've always had this imageof how my life would be.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.949
Following my dreamsand my passions

17:55.991 --> 17:57.451
and making a difference...

17:57.451 --> 17:58.660
and I'm doing all that,

17:58.702 --> 18:02.122
with Blue Islandand my students.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.042
Well, you can't livein the past, Claire.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.295
You're gonna miss out on allthe new, wonderful adventures.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.839
I found the perfect veil.

18:10.881 --> 18:11.840
No, I found the perfect veil.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.800
You know what?

18:12.841 --> 18:14.176
I think I'm gonna gowithout a veil.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.637
How'd the orientation go?

18:16.678 --> 18:17.638
It was good,

18:17.638 --> 18:19.640
except Captain Mayweatheris retiring

18:19.640 --> 18:20.808
and he sold the "Seagull."

18:20.808 --> 18:22.476
-Well, that's nice.-Yeah.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.813
Except the new owner,Captain Hastings,

18:25.854 --> 18:27.606
is really different.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.732
He's younger

18:28.774 --> 18:30.984
and kind of a know-it-all.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.152
Younger?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
Cute?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.114
No comment.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.198
Which is always a yes!

18:36.240 --> 18:38.033
It's besides the point.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.243
Something tells me

18:39.284 --> 18:42.955
he's gonna be harderto manage than my students.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.504
It's always goodto see you, Claire.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.713
Tim, I met the surveyors.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.007
They told me that Blue Islandmight be for sale.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.176
Ah. And it might've been nice

18:56.218 --> 18:58.846
to hear that firstfrom your godfather?

18:58.846 --> 18:59.847
Yes.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.515
I didn't want to worry you,

19:01.515 --> 19:03.725
and right nowit's strictly exploratory.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.519
But it might beon the sale block?

19:05.519 --> 19:06.854
Well, the town is just lookingat their options at this time.

19:06.895 --> 19:10.732
Tim, you knowwhat the island means

19:10.774 --> 19:11.859
to this community.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.026
I do.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.487
And I'll let you knowif anything changes,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.906
but right now,it's just the first step.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.366
Nothing may come of it.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.285
But something might.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.454
Claire.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.707
Or should I stickwith "Ms. Richards"?

19:26.748 --> 19:27.749
[laughs]

19:27.791 --> 19:29.293
Claire's finewhen I'm not teaching.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.335
All right.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.587
What brings you here?

19:31.628 --> 19:33.255
Uh, fishing license.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.716
I'm renewing, so watch out.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.385
Ah. Well, as long asyou're licensed to sail.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.387
Ah, no worries about that.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.263
[chuckles]

19:41.305 --> 19:42.973
I'll see ya.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.975
[♪♪]

19:46.351 --> 19:47.895
Hi.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.897
Hi...

19:49.938 --> 19:51.982
I heard you were back.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.027
Yeah.Just got in yesterday.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.574
Oh... I won't keep you.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.575
I'm sorry.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.035
It's not thatit's not nice catching up.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.620
I'm just kind of running lateas it is.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.914
There's no need to explain.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.749
Wish we had more timeto catch up.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.209
Well, we have Saturday.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.669
Amber's wedding.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.424
Right.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.509
To be continued.

I know.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.808
It's been untapped potentialfor years,

46:09.808 --> 46:12.478
but we can putthat island to good use.

46:12.478 --> 46:14.313
It already has a good use.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.564
It could be more.

46:15.606 --> 46:18.025
More jobs,more opportunity.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.152
And never mind at what cost?

46:20.194 --> 46:22.905
The resort footprintis actually quite small.

46:22.946 --> 46:25.991
Minimally invasive,an enhancement.

46:25.991 --> 46:28.035
And I seethat it says "phase one,"

46:28.076 --> 46:31.497
which probably means there'sa "phase two" coming, right?

Look, Claire.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.845

46:46.887 --> 46:49.014
We have a lot of investors

46:49.056 --> 46:51.016
who will need to getto and from the island,

46:51.058 --> 46:52.351
and when we open,

46:52.351 --> 46:54.186
plenty of gueststo take out on excursions.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.104

46:56.146 --> 46:58.106
He didn't say no.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.198
[Claire] I feel so betrayed.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.366
You know, I really thought

47:07.366 --> 47:08.951
that he loved the islandas much as I do.

47:08.992 --> 47:12.204
I'm sure he thinkshe's helping Willow Bay.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.705
Well, he's wrong!

47:13.747 --> 47:17.584
The island has value beyondwhat some hotel would bring.

And the worst part isthat nobody even seems to care.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.756

58:49.484 --> 58:51.069
Watch your step.

58:51.110 --> 58:53.112
There's a dip here.

58:57.283 --> 58:59.827
I used to work summers hereas a guide.

58:59.869 --> 59:02.455
So I'm gettingthe official tour?

59:02.497 --> 59:04.499
On the house.

59:07.460 --> 59:08.628
This is so cool.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.256
Right?Isn't it so beautiful here?

59:11.297 --> 59:12.215
Yeah.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.509
This lighthousewas built in 1858.

59:17.971 --> 59:20.807
It's been guiding men homefrom sea ever since.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.937
It's a real piece of history.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.274
Fresnel lens?

59:29.315 --> 59:32.735
Gem lens.You can see it for miles.

59:39.200 --> 59:43.496
After my mother passed away,it was just my dad and I.

59:43.538 --> 59:46.124
So it got pretty toughto watch him go away,

59:46.124 --> 59:48.042
sometimes for days at a time.

59:48.084 --> 59:49.961
[takes a deep breath]So...

59:49.961 --> 59:51.296
I took a job here to...

59:52.338 --> 59:53.798
...feel like I was playinga small part

59:53.840 --> 59:56.301
in keeping him safe.

59:56.342 --> 59:57.468
Come on.

59:57.468 --> 59:59.220
This is whatI really wanted to show you.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.520
[Tom chuckles]

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.899
You were right.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.401
This is a view.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.403
Yeah.

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:18.197
Do you think you'll miss it?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.034
When you're gone?

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.494
When I'm gone?

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:25.330
Yeah.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:28.333
Onto your next big adventure.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.545
Right.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.467
It'll be tough to leave.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:41.512
Maybe you're more sentimentalthan you think.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:42.764
Is that so?

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.848
-Yeah.-All right.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.767
[both laughing]

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.941
Thank you for showing me that.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.361
I really appreciate it.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.696
I thought you might like it.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.823
And I'd loveto return the favor.

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:02.367
What are you doingfor dinner tonight?

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:05.203
I don't have any plans.

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:07.997
Well, now you do.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:12.085
[♪♪]

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.767
Hi.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.560
[laughs] You're early.

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:34.899
What's all this?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.444
Dinner.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.116
This looks delicious.

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:44.909
Thank you.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.702
You made this?

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:47.912
No.

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.248
[laughing]

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.125
But I did order itfrom a very long list.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.209
Oh.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.422
I have a question.

01:01:57.463 --> 01:02:01.092
-Mm. I may have an answer.-Okay.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.559
[overlapping] Cheers.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.603
[inhales deeply]

01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:14.981
Jason McClure.

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:17.108
Mm, right.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:23.614
Well, we've known each othersince high school,

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:26.951
and after college,we dated for a few years,

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:33.166
and when all of our friendsstarted planning their weddings,

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:36.043
I was pretty sureours would be the fourth.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.299
What happened?

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:45.511
He took a jobat a law firm in another state.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:47.805
It was really important to him,

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:50.224
but Willow Bayis important to me.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:54.729
And he didn't seemto understand that,

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:58.232
so we ended things.

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:01.819
And now he's back.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.822
Mm. Now he's back.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:09.702
Is that why you invited meto the wedding?

01:03:11.078 --> 01:03:12.997
The way I remember it,

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.333
you were only in itfor the wedding cake.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.459
[chuckles]

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:19.962
I'm serious, though.

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.466
Did you just invite meto make him jealous?

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:27.261
No.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:32.266
No, I asked youbecause I wanted you there.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.228
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:37.897
[laughing]

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:40.525
You order very well.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.985
I have years of practice.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.532
[Claire]Do you really think it'll work?

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:49.534
What?

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:52.453
Going to the board meeting.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.747
Well, the whole town shows up,

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.458
then they're gonnahave to listen,

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.002
and if you let them knowhow you feel...

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.214
You're very persuasive.

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:13.558
Thank you for all of your helpand support...

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.560
and for dinner.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.938
Anytime...

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.899
for all of the above.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:24.819
I'm gladwe ran into each other.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.114
On which occasion?

01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:31.075
All of them.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.663
[♪♪]

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.593
I should go.

01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.597
Okay.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.348
Yeah.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.487
I'll see you at the meeting.

01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.448
I'll be there.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.417
[♪♪]

01:05:23.544 --> 01:05:28.633
Oh! So, I've hired your captainto take us to the island.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:32.303
He is not "my captain."

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:35.139
He is merelyacaptain,

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.807
and...

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:39.310
while we have beenspending some time together,

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.354
that doesn't make himmy captain.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.528
What's going on here?

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:50.988
Hmm?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.698
Nothing.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.825
What aren't you telling me?

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:55.868
We kissed!

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:56.994
[sighs]

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.372
We were spendingall day together yesterday,

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:00.498
and he helped mewith Blue Island,

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:03.209
and then we hadthis beautiful dinner,

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.960
and then we...

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:06.337
You kissed.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.255
We kissed.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.010
Okay, so how do you feelabout the whole thing?

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:14.345
I don't know.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:15.596
Well, you weren'tthinking about Jason?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:16.889
Definitely not.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:17.890
Well, that's good.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:18.974
Mm-hmm.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:21.227
You know...

01:06:21.268 --> 01:06:23.354
I think you might be right.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.565
I think it's time to leavethe past in the past.

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:28.651
Good.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:36.033
The value of Blue Islandcannot be overstated.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.035
We, um...

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.328
[frustrated sigh]

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.373
This would be betterwithout the cards, wouldn't it?

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.749
The cards are fine.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.668
I want to make sure it soundslike it's coming from the heart.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.294
No one who hears that

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.922
will have any doubtof your sincerity.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.549
What if nobody shows up?

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.550
They will.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.634
How can you be so sure?

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.387
You have alwayshad this ability

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.848
to inspire great thingsin others, Claire.

01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.392
Trust that.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:06.439
[♪♪]

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.775
Claire, you're startingto make me seasick.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.986
Oh, sorry, I'm just anxious.

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:14.905
Still not much of a crowd.

01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:16.282
There's time.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:18.325
Yeah, it'll fill up soon.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:21.245
Have you heard from Tom?

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.955
No, not yet.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.749
I'm sure he's just held up.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.292
Yeah.

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:28.919
[gavel bangs]

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.382
Here we go.

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:43.100
The business before the council

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.103

[clears her throat]

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.462
Hi.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.964
Um, my name is Claire Richards,

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:17.801
and I teach summer enrichmentbiology for the high school.

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:20.470
We do field study researchon Blue Island.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:22.807
[takes a deep breath]

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.225
I've runthe summer enrichment program

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.853
for five years now,

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.189
and I can't evenbegin to express

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.733
the impactthat it has on our children.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.984
I grew up in Willow Bay.

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:36.654
It's my home,

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:38.738
and for anyonewho grew up in Willow Bay,

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.326
Blue Islandis a huge part of life.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:46.831
It means somethingto the people of this town.

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:51.292
[sighs] Um...

01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:53.212
[door opens]

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.675
[♪♪]

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:03.139
My mother used to always say

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.599
that the islandhad a lot to teach me,

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.185
but I think it hasa lot to teach all of us...

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:12.022
about appreciatingthe things that we have

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.691
while we have them,

01:09:13.732 --> 01:09:15.234
and not taking for granted

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:18.279
the thingsthat make us truly happy.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.241
Blue Islandisn't just a piece of land.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.787
It's...camping in the summer.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:30.249
It's nature walksin the spring.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.084
It's trips with your family,

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.586
and senior skip days,

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.546
and... and first dates.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.176
It's Willow Bay.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.636
It doesn'tjust connect us to nature.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.265
You know, it connects usto each other...

01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:53.856
And we simply cannot lose that.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.736
Thank you.

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:00.696

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.940
It's over.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:30.028
It is?

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.488
We won.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:33.823
We won?

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:35.867
We won! We won!

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:37.577
Ah, that is such good news.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:42.666
And you were the first personthat I wanted to tell.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.293
I'm right here.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.879
For how long, though?

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.839
And you have plans, too.

01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:51.716
Sail the world...

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:54.386
Well, my plans changed, too.

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:55.512
They did?

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.430
Yeah.

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.683
If I was gonna sailaround the world,

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:02.352
then who would stay hereand help you look for plovers?

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.479
And who would make surethat I had my snacks?

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.189
That's very important.

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:07.232
And who would keep you from

01:23:07.273 --> 01:23:08.525
falling off the dockinto the water?

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.360
Listen, I was notgonna fall into the water

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:12.696
in the first place,if it wasn't for you.

01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:14.948

Your turn.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.044
Good catch.

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:29.254
No.

01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:30.255
No?
