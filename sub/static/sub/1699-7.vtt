WEBVTT

00:10.734 --> 00:12.592
Please, Rae, it does
not matter who wins

00:12.593 --> 00:14.267
these student
council elections.

00:14.268 --> 00:16.704
I mean, the president never
gets anything done.

00:16.705 --> 00:19.122
We need a president who
will actually do something.

00:19.123 --> 00:20.875
This place is
falling apart.

00:20.876 --> 00:22.166
It's not that bad.

00:26.604 --> 00:28.663
Uno, dos, tres...

00:32.942 --> 00:35.178
Come on, Rae, look at
these lockers. Yeah, I know.

00:35.179 --> 00:37.368
It's horrible the way
they just open up like that.

00:37.369 --> 00:40.271
Ooh, girl, look--
the new Mary J. Blige CD.

00:40.272 --> 00:42.208
Oh! I got to borrow this one.

00:47.496 --> 00:48.518
You know what, it
would be so easy

00:48.519 --> 00:49.322
to just get them fixed.

00:49.323 --> 00:50.413
All you have to do
is write a letter

00:50.414 --> 00:52.129
to the school maintenance
department.

00:52.130 --> 00:55.046
It's right there in Section G-42
of the student manual.

00:57.395 --> 00:59.034
You know the student manual?

01:06.364 --> 01:08.170
You know, you
should just run.

01:08.171 --> 01:11.102
Rae, there's no running
in the school hallways.

01:11.103 --> 01:13.849
Section I-14,
"Hallways: Do's and Don'ts."

01:14.522 --> 01:16.498
I meant you should run
for student president.

01:16.499 --> 01:18.010
Do's and Don'ts.

01:19.568 --> 01:20.646
I don't know, Rae.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.433
I'm not the kind of person
people vote for.

01:22.434 --> 01:24.330
You know, you've got to be,
like, in the "in crowd"

01:24.331 --> 01:25.615
and who wants that?

01:25.616 --> 01:26.665
Yeah.

01:26.666 --> 01:27.762
I do.

01:29.121 --> 01:30.312
I don't know, I mean

01:30.313 --> 01:32.816
I know I'd be, like, a really
good president, but...

01:32.817 --> 01:34.903
"But"? But what,
Chelsea?

01:34.904 --> 01:36.776
I mean, you know about
all the problems...

01:40.004 --> 01:42.071
And when you get elected
could you please

01:42.072 --> 01:43.377
do something about that stench?

01:45.024 --> 01:46.729
Ben Sturky!

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:56.901 --> 01:58.256
Student council elections?

01:58.257 --> 01:59.643
I think I'm going to run.

02:00.064 --> 02:01.352
I smell victory.

02:01.353 --> 02:02.865
Oh, I'm sure
everybody does.

02:03.905 --> 02:05.300
Oh! Thanks!

02:05.301 --> 02:06.425
Rock the vote.

02:06.998 --> 02:08.584
How about wash
the vote?

02:09.934 --> 02:11.789
You know, Rae, I was
thinking I wouldn't be

02:11.790 --> 02:12.591
that bad at it.

02:12.592 --> 02:13.630
I could be a really
good president.

02:13.631 --> 02:17.607
You know, I'm friendly,
I'm loyal, I'm energetic.

02:18.161 --> 02:20.200
I just described a dog,
didn't I?

02:21.194 --> 02:22.435
Well, yeah.

02:22.436 --> 02:24.614
But, you know,
people love dogs.

02:26.664 --> 02:29.404
Think about it, Chels--
you against Ben Sturky?

02:29.405 --> 02:30.810
Girl, you do the math.

02:40.564 --> 02:43.319
Actually, math wasn't
my very best subject.

02:44.199 --> 02:46.296
Okay, Rae, I want
to do it.

02:46.297 --> 02:47.405
You totally convinced me.

02:47.406 --> 02:48.216
I want to run.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.314
Oh, I never even
would have thought

02:49.315 --> 02:50.799
about doing this
if it wasn't for you.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.959
Thank you.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.849
Yeah... girl.

02:54.331 --> 02:55.700
What are friends for?

03:46.654 --> 03:48.064
Yep, that's me.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.738
Eddie, you should have seen
this vision.

03:56.739 --> 04:00.138
Chelsea got three votes
and Ben got 187.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.533
Did you tell her?

04:01.534 --> 04:02.812
No, I couldn't do that.

04:02.813 --> 04:03.824
You know Chelsea.

04:03.825 --> 04:05.612
I mean, she'll take it
all personally.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.129
I wouldn't do that
to her.

04:07.746 --> 04:11.038
Oh... look how cute she
looks passing out her fliers.

04:11.039 --> 04:12.554
Who wouldn't vote
for that?

04:17.274 --> 04:20.380
My pistachio praline
triple scoop!

04:21.079 --> 04:22.960
Oh, Mr. Lawler...

04:22.961 --> 04:24.343
I'm so sorry.

04:24.344 --> 04:26.659
Oh, no problem.

04:26.973 --> 04:28.679
Ah... what the heck.

04:32.434 --> 04:34.268
How does she get
two votes?

04:34.269 --> 04:35.332
No, three votes.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.802
I'm on the fence.

04:40.445 --> 04:41.593
Okay, Chels...

04:41.594 --> 04:43.733
this is how it
breaks down.

04:43.734 --> 04:47.698
In our school,
there are 64 jocks

04:47.699 --> 04:49.363
22 nerds

04:49.364 --> 04:50.817
16 hip-hoppers

04:50.818 --> 04:53.192
and three Jamaican
exchange students.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.190
Now, in order
to get their votes

04:55.191 --> 04:56.437
you got to speak their language.

04:56.758 --> 04:59.112
I mean, you gots to walk
the walk

04:59.113 --> 05:00.579
and talk the talk.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.084
Or walk the walk
and chit the chat.

05:03.559 --> 05:05.218
I just added my
own little flair.

05:05.789 --> 05:07.835
Yes, you sure did.

05:07.836 --> 05:08.993
Don't.

05:11.430 --> 05:12.819
We're going to start
with the jocks.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.148
Okay, there's two things
you got to know, Chels.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.729
You gots
to keep it simple

05:16.730 --> 05:18.265
and you gots to grunt.

05:20.565 --> 05:21.531
Yo.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.899
Yo.

05:24.339 --> 05:25.704
Yo-yo!
Yo-yo!

05:28.872 --> 05:29.888
Ouch!

05:32.104 --> 05:33.088
Yo!

05:33.089 --> 05:34.060
Vote for Chelsea!

05:34.061 --> 05:35.242
Are we going
to win this thing?

05:35.243 --> 05:36.528
Are we going to win
this thing?

05:36.529 --> 05:38.898
Yeah, Coach-- we're going
to win this thing!

05:39.373 --> 05:42.108
Go, go, go, go...

05:42.109 --> 05:44.041
Eddie, watch it!

05:44.042 --> 05:45.167
Your Aunt Lois

05:45.168 --> 05:46.295
is in that vase!

05:46.296 --> 05:47.407
Yo, Ma!

05:47.408 --> 05:49.975
Sorry, they were just helping me
with my campaign.

05:49.976 --> 05:51.233
Vote for Chelsea!

05:51.234 --> 05:53.508
Go... Chelsea!

05:53.916 --> 05:55.116
That was my jock!

05:56.457 --> 05:59.234
And it was very good.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.599
Help her.

06:02.137 --> 06:05.734
Well, you know you got my vote,
baby.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.491
Well, at least you know
you got the round people's vote.

06:09.492 --> 06:11.003
Okay...

06:11.004 --> 06:12.646
We're going to work
on the hip-hoppers.

06:12.647 --> 06:13.948
Oh, let me do
that one.

06:13.949 --> 06:16.268
We're talking about
my girl, Chelsea, here

06:16.269 --> 06:18.398
I mean, she's in
the heezy forsheezy

06:18.399 --> 06:19.600
She's off the chain

06:19.601 --> 06:20.733
She got my vote

06:20.734 --> 06:22.038
She got my props and...

06:22.039 --> 06:24.119
She got my shirt.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.667
What are you doing
in my shirt?

06:26.668 --> 06:29.139
Mom... now, we're just
using it for the campaign.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.119
No big deal.

06:30.705 --> 06:32.959
Yo-ho, Mom

06:32.960 --> 06:35.888
I was just borrowing
your shirty basirty

06:35.889 --> 06:39.542
Because mine was all dirty
basirty, yeah.

06:39.543 --> 06:41.315
Can you use the same word
twice?

06:44.539 --> 06:45.753
Uh, yeah, Rae...

06:46.600 --> 06:48.076
I'm off the fence.

06:50.809 --> 06:51.665
Okay, Chels...

06:51.666 --> 06:53.638
maybe we should work
on the Jamaican vote.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.263
Oh, now,
that one's easy.

06:55.264 --> 06:56.938
You want a Jamaican vote, child?

06:56.939 --> 06:58.163
Me gonna tell you how.

06:58.164 --> 07:02.434
Come closer and listen
to the island breezes.

07:04.004 --> 07:10.464
Come closer and listen
to the island breezes.

07:12.164 --> 07:15.303
Methinks a vote for Chelsea

07:15.304 --> 07:17.507
is a vote
for better lockers...

07:17.508 --> 07:20.498
a new bike rack...

07:21.390 --> 07:24.670
And jerk chicken
in the cafeteria, mon.

07:24.671 --> 07:25.957
Boo-boo!

07:27.835 --> 07:29.696
Hey, Chelsea,
listen to me.

07:29.697 --> 07:31.213
Come here.
Excuse me.

07:32.944 --> 07:34.893
The Jamaicans
are over there.

07:41.997 --> 07:43.638
All right, Chelsea...
nerd votes.

07:43.639 --> 07:44.682
Go get them.

07:49.334 --> 07:51.957
Greetings, guys.

07:52.928 --> 07:54.463
Chelsea Daniels here.

07:54.464 --> 07:56.503
I tell you,
to vote for me

07:56.504 --> 07:59.047
and I'll increase the volume
of space

07:59.048 --> 08:01.294
in all of your lockers.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.270
Well...

08:05.271 --> 08:07.735
since volume is length
times width times height

08:07.736 --> 08:08.833
and height is a constant

08:08.834 --> 08:10.820
I severely doubt you can
increase the size

08:10.821 --> 08:11.918
of our lockers.

08:17.904 --> 08:20.007
Oh, okay...
keep up...

08:20.008 --> 08:21.659
keep that snoring thing
going, you guys.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.577
It really drives girls wild.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.338
What can I do
to get your vote?

08:28.339 --> 08:29.200
It'd be great

08:29.201 --> 08:29.981
if we had
some better food

08:29.982 --> 08:30.951
around here.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.739
I'm going to march
into that kitchen

08:33.740 --> 08:35.695
and I'm going to close
the door behind me

08:35.696 --> 08:37.224
and I'm gonna tell that cook

08:37.225 --> 08:39.308
"I'm not leaving here

08:39.308 --> 08:40.876
"until you give us vegetables
that are green

08:40.876 --> 08:42.360
and meat that's not."

08:42.361 --> 08:43.548
He's got my vote.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.820
Go, Ben...

08:45.821 --> 08:47.404
Go, Ben.

08:48.634 --> 08:50.998
Hey, how we going
to compete with that, Rae?

08:50.999 --> 08:52.791
He's stinkin' his way
to the top.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.503
He's not there yet,
okay?

08:54.504 --> 08:56.601
We can't just give up
and let Chelsea lose.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.472
She'll be totally humiliated.

09:02.204 --> 09:03.563
Hey, guys...

09:03.564 --> 09:06.371
all right, before you vote
for Ben... you know.

09:10.138 --> 09:12.099
Let me tell you some
of Chelsea's ideas.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.456
First, you know how sometimes
the ceiling falls down on us?

09:14.457 --> 09:15.854
Well, it turns out, like

09:15.855 --> 09:18.239
it violates all these,
like, laws and things.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.398
And, um, Chelsea knows
just who to complain to.

09:23.399 --> 09:24.733
I don't care about that.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.908
Really? Well, Joy,
what do you care about?

09:27.909 --> 09:30.007
Cause whatever it is, girl,
Chelsea will hook it up.

09:30.974 --> 09:33.434
I care about getting these
library books back on time.

09:34.413 --> 09:35.409
Really?

09:35.410 --> 09:39.684
Well, um, it's a deal...
if you vote for Chelsea.

09:40.053 --> 09:41.424
Don't tell her.

09:41.425 --> 09:42.704
Cool. I'll vote
for her.

09:42.705 --> 09:43.165
Okay.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.209
Hey, if you walk
my dog after school

09:45.210 --> 09:46.867
I'll vote for Chelsea,
too.

09:46.868 --> 09:48.163
Deal.

09:48.164 --> 09:50.293
Just don't tell her.

09:53.064 --> 09:55.598
Uh, Rae,
what are you doing?

09:55.599 --> 09:57.233
I'm getting some votes.

09:57.234 --> 09:59.089
Hey, it's two more
than we had.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.035
What's a couple
of extra chores?

10:05.734 --> 10:08.060
Just a couple
of extra chores, huh?

10:09.281 --> 10:11.099
Okay, consider your wheels
oiled.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.033
Vote Chelsea.
Next.

10:13.034 --> 10:14.999
Uh, one tuba washed and buffed.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.223
Got it... vote Chelsea.

10:16.224 --> 10:16.866
Don't tell her.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.671
Keep it moving, people.
keep it moving.

10:19.672 --> 10:22.887
Keep...
keep it moving, Chels.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.524
What you doing here,
sweetheart?

10:24.525 --> 10:26.402
Rae, we always
meet for lunch.

10:26.403 --> 10:27.559
You know,
I've been meaning

10:27.560 --> 10:28.854
to talk to you
about that.

10:28.855 --> 10:29.981
We need to mix it up.

10:29.982 --> 10:31.263
Get to see new people.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.761
And you know
what they say.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.198
When you love someone,
you got to let them go.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.404
I love you, Chelsea,
go.

10:39.545 --> 10:41.678
Rae, why are all
these people lined up?

10:42.116 --> 10:43.343
They're your public.

10:44.964 --> 10:46.301
Everybody!

10:46.631 --> 10:47.702
I would like you

10:47.703 --> 10:50.889
to meet the new president
of these United...

10:52.664 --> 10:55.734
classes... Chelsea...

10:59.472 --> 11:00.939
She's over here.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.668
Daniels!

11:06.734 --> 11:09.661
Wow... looks like things
are starting to get better.

11:09.662 --> 11:11.146
I'm going to get
some more fliers, okay?

11:11.147 --> 11:11.865
Okay.

11:15.764 --> 11:17.793
See? You see
how happy she is?

11:17.794 --> 11:18.733
And you know what?

11:18.734 --> 11:20.494
It really didn't really take
all that much work.

11:20.892 --> 11:22.476
Baby-sit my
little sister.

11:28.904 --> 11:30.063
One at a time..

11:30.064 --> 11:32.038
one at a time, people...

11:32.039 --> 11:33.134
one at a time!

11:38.942 --> 11:40.927
Okay, uh, one bike wash.
Got you.

11:40.928 --> 11:42.037
Vote Chelsea.

11:43.544 --> 11:44.655
Hello.

11:44.656 --> 11:45.631
Yes, it's true.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.603
One vote for Chelsea
gets you a favor.

11:49.555 --> 11:51.898
Yeah, sure, Eddie will take
you out on Saturday.

11:51.899 --> 11:52.714
What?!

11:53.573 --> 11:54.864
Oh, and he'd love to wear that.

11:54.865 --> 11:55.548
Okay, bye.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.499
Vote Chelsea.

11:57.404 --> 11:59.004
Wear what,
and who was that, Rae?

11:59.005 --> 12:01.814
Uh, I don't know, but she going
to pick you up at 8:00

12:01.815 --> 12:03.083
and wear your biker shorts.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.384
Oh, great.

12:05.385 --> 12:08.545
First I'm a dog washer,
now I'm somebody's boy-toy.

12:08.921 --> 12:11.617
Eddie, listen, we do
not want Chelsea

12:11.618 --> 12:13.334
to lose this
election, okay?

12:13.335 --> 12:15.754
You know how she gets when one
person doesn't like her.

12:15.755 --> 12:19.263
This is 187 people
not liking her.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.863
Oh, sweetie.

12:20.864 --> 12:22.638
Take...
it's good.

12:22.639 --> 12:24.075
Yummy, see?

12:29.867 --> 12:30.752
Okay, now I know why

12:30.753 --> 12:32.460
they feed that to people
who can't talk.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.451
Come here.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.046
For all this work

12:37.047 --> 12:38.371
Chelsea going to have
to break me off

12:38.372 --> 12:39.680
a little something
something.

12:39.681 --> 12:41.387
If you tell Chelsea
about all this

12:41.388 --> 12:43.540
I'll break you off
into a little nothing nothing.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.908
Whoa, stinky baby!

12:48.254 --> 12:51.075
I think his poop
just pooped.

12:53.755 --> 12:54.911
Corey, you go
get the door.

12:54.912 --> 12:56.056
Eddie, come change
this baby.

12:56.057 --> 12:57.814
Why do I have
to change him?

12:57.815 --> 12:58.990
Because I fed him.

12:58.991 --> 13:00.152
Exactly.

13:00.153 --> 13:01.724
You fed him,
so that means

13:01.725 --> 13:05.081
this is your fault all up
in the booty area.

13:07.392 --> 13:09.799
I fill the top,
you empty the bottom.

13:14.204 --> 13:15.204
Chelsea!

13:16.876 --> 13:18.182
Sorry, baby.

13:22.396 --> 13:23.663
It's Chelsea!

13:23.664 --> 13:25.062
What is she doing here?

13:25.063 --> 13:26.755
Well, maybe she's
dropping off her laundry.

13:26.756 --> 13:28.655
I mean, everybody else
in the world is.

13:29.604 --> 13:32.336
You guys, change the garage
and put everything in the baby.

13:33.269 --> 13:35.134
Reverse that, strike it, okay.

13:37.302 --> 13:39.551
Hey, Chelse,
how's it going, girl?

13:39.552 --> 13:40.884
Great.
I have my speech.

13:40.885 --> 13:41.511
Do you want to hear it?

13:41.512 --> 13:42.791
Oh, and ruin the surprise?

13:42.792 --> 13:43.999
Never.

13:52.929 --> 13:55.401
How come everyone keeps
slamming the door in my face?

13:57.239 --> 14:00.545
Because, um, yeah, um...

14:00.546 --> 14:04.394
Corey is doing a science project
on, um, how many times

14:04.395 --> 14:05.938
somebody can get
the door slammed in their face

14:05.939 --> 14:07.370
before they say something.

14:07.699 --> 14:08.963
Yeah, uh...

14:08.964 --> 14:10.528
Corey, she's a three!

14:12.434 --> 14:13.947
Anyway, want to hear
my speech now?

14:13.948 --> 14:15.727
Oh, oh, girl, I would love to

14:15.728 --> 14:17.217
but I got to go answer
the phone, okay.

14:18.088 --> 14:19.742
I- I didn't hear the phone ring.

14:21.944 --> 14:22.969
Right.

14:23.504 --> 14:26.386
That's because, um, I'm psychic.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.617
I see the future.

14:28.364 --> 14:29.343
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

14:29.344 --> 14:30.309
Oh, there goes another one.

14:30.310 --> 14:31.807
I have psychic call waiting.

14:34.261 --> 14:35.744
I can't get rid
of Chelsea.

14:35.745 --> 14:36.815
You guys have to get
all this stuff

14:36.816 --> 14:38.638
out of...
what are you doing?

14:38.639 --> 14:39.963
Shh.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.016
No sudden moves, Rae.

14:41.017 --> 14:42.498
We're trying to take
him by surprise.

14:42.955 --> 14:45.838
Sweet little baby.

14:45.839 --> 14:46.833
Sweet?

14:46.834 --> 14:48.418
That ain't chocolate
in there.

14:50.109 --> 14:52.075
Okay, listen.
all you do

14:52.076 --> 14:54.010
is take off these
little tabs like this.

14:54.011 --> 14:55.478
There's nothing to it.

15:00.312 --> 15:01.965
Is that a dog in there?

15:07.453 --> 15:08.962
Rae, Rae, I could
have sworn

15:08.963 --> 15:09.748
I heard barking.

15:09.749 --> 15:10.834
Oh, girl, that's
just my cough.

15:12.252 --> 15:14.459
No, it didn't
sound like that.

15:14.460 --> 15:17.486
It sounded more like
a dog barking-- a real dog.

15:17.487 --> 15:19.055
Girl, that's crazy.
I don't have a dog.

15:19.056 --> 15:19.837
I know.

15:22.864 --> 15:24.476
Well, have you met my dog?

15:24.477 --> 15:26.181
You just said you
didn't have a dog.

15:26.182 --> 15:27.630
Um, I don't. You do.

15:27.631 --> 15:29.560
Happy birthday!

15:30.304 --> 15:32.233
Here, take this dirty diaper.

15:32.234 --> 15:33.442
What do you want me
to do with it?

15:33.443 --> 15:34.663
Toss it.
Oh, okay.

15:34.664 --> 15:36.033
I don't want it, man, here.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.782
I don't want it.
I don't want it neither.

15:41.864 --> 15:44.926
Ugh, it's cooking.

15:48.432 --> 15:49.343
Where you going?

15:49.344 --> 15:50.512
To get something
to drink.

15:50.513 --> 15:53.046
Oh, I'll get something
to drink for you.

15:53.047 --> 15:55.265
Don't worry about
that, Chelsea.

15:59.004 --> 16:00.456
Here you go.

16:00.457 --> 16:01.552
There.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.886
I'll make sure
it's good for you.

16:05.887 --> 16:08.556
Thanks, but I was thinking
something more like a soda.

16:09.104 --> 16:11.559
Soda? Girl, do you know
that stuff is bad for you?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.270
Milk brings strong bones.

16:13.271 --> 16:13.985
Got to work on it.

16:13.986 --> 16:16.998
I'll even join you
with... a nice soda.

16:18.740 --> 16:19.903
Thanks.

16:19.904 --> 16:21.233
Oh, I'll get that.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.765
You just sit down and
take care of your new dog.

16:23.766 --> 16:24.589
Okay.

16:26.047 --> 16:27.624
Hey, what do you want?

16:27.625 --> 16:29.273
You said you'd take
Buddy for a walk.

16:29.274 --> 16:31.198
Oh, well, how did
you guys get here?

16:31.199 --> 16:32.683
We walked.

16:32.684 --> 16:34.168
Well, I guess my job is done.

16:34.169 --> 16:35.134
Vote Chelsea.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.251
Oh, man, another baby.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.504
Who laughing now, little man?

17:01.264 --> 17:02.749
What is going on
in that kitchen?

17:02.750 --> 17:03.745
Nothing.

17:05.464 --> 17:06.851
What was that?

17:07.544 --> 17:08.832
You know what?

17:08.833 --> 17:11.704
First you want to spoil
your birthday present

17:11.705 --> 17:13.661
and now you want
to ruin Christmas?

17:13.662 --> 17:15.363
You got me a baby?

17:15.364 --> 17:16.938
Some people would
just say thank you.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.251
Rae, what is
going on in there?

17:21.252 --> 17:22.832
Chelsea, trust me.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.268
You don't want to see what's
going on in that kitchen.

17:28.917 --> 17:29.938
Okay, Rae.

17:29.939 --> 17:31.034
Okay.

17:34.864 --> 17:36.769
Want to scrub my back, baby?

17:39.806 --> 17:42.889
Hey, um, yeah, so,
Eddie just dropped by

17:42.890 --> 17:43.998
and brought us
some surfboards

17:43.999 --> 17:45.084
and some babies.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.364
What's going on?

17:49.419 --> 17:51.083
Hey, what's up, Raven?

17:51.084 --> 17:52.054
We had a deal.

17:52.055 --> 17:53.215
If you don't walk my dog

17:53.216 --> 17:55.064
I'm not voting for her.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.605
What is she talking about, Rae?

18:02.534 --> 18:05.164
Are you bribing people
to vote for me?

18:06.934 --> 18:08.229
Are you?

18:08.832 --> 18:10.895
Yes, but only because
I had a vision

18:10.896 --> 18:13.410
that you were going
to lose, so...

18:13.986 --> 18:15.603
Then why didn't you
just tell me?

18:15.604 --> 18:17.568
Because I didn't want
you to get hurt.

18:17.569 --> 18:18.929
Yeah?

18:19.529 --> 18:21.434
Well, how do you think
I feel now?

18:25.064 --> 18:27.947
Chelse, please...
No, wait, Chelse!

18:31.404 --> 18:34.035
People, today the candidates

18:34.036 --> 18:36.104
will be presenting
their platforms.

18:37.781 --> 18:39.240
Why is that important?

18:39.871 --> 18:41.664
Because every one of us

18:41.665 --> 18:44.851
is a participant
in the political process.

18:50.950 --> 18:52.787
No need to panic, people.

18:52.788 --> 18:54.301
I'll just have

18:54.302 --> 18:55.744
to project.

18:58.506 --> 18:59.776
Go away.

18:59.777 --> 19:00.862
I called
you last night.

19:00.863 --> 19:02.161
You've got to talk
to me sometime.

19:02.162 --> 19:03.723
No, I don't.
Go away.

19:03.724 --> 19:04.496
Come backstage.

19:04.497 --> 19:05.151
No!

19:05.152 --> 19:06.073
I'll hit you.

19:06.554 --> 19:07.504
You will not.

19:14.864 --> 19:15.742
What?

19:15.743 --> 19:18.395
Okay, um, well,
I'm just going to say it.

19:18.396 --> 19:21.876
Bribing people was
a very bad thing

19:21.877 --> 19:23.682
and girl, from my heart,
I am really sorry.

19:23.683 --> 19:25.801
I am really, really sorry.

19:25.802 --> 19:27.198
Okay, give me some love.

19:27.199 --> 19:28.069
Are you done?

19:28.872 --> 19:31.736
Yeah, I would be if
you gave a girl some love.

19:33.264 --> 19:35.295
Wait, okay,
Chelsea, please.

19:36.304 --> 19:38.615
Listen, I didn't want
you to get hurt.

19:38.616 --> 19:40.655
I thought I was being
a good friend.

19:40.964 --> 19:42.789
You don't have to protect
me all the time.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.846
I'm a big girl.

19:45.070 --> 19:47.098
So what if I lose by 100 votes?

19:47.099 --> 19:48.497
187.

19:50.036 --> 19:51.726
Okay, didn't need to know that.

19:52.986 --> 19:54.416
Look, it's
disappointing

19:54.417 --> 19:56.952
but I'll get over it.

19:57.638 --> 19:58.663
I guess I should have told you

19:58.664 --> 20:00.703
about my vision
in the first place, huh?

20:00.704 --> 20:02.747
But you didn't,
and now I have to go out there

20:02.748 --> 20:04.226
in front of all those people,
and I don't know

20:04.227 --> 20:05.180
what to say.

20:05.181 --> 20:08.335
Well, what do you want to say?

20:10.696 --> 20:11.994
I don't know.

20:11.995 --> 20:14.864
I mean, part of me wants
to tell them that I quit

20:14.865 --> 20:17.505
but... but then
the other part of me

20:17.506 --> 20:18.333
wants to say that

20:18.334 --> 20:20.222
that all bribes are off

20:20.223 --> 20:21.471
but you should vote
for me anyways

20:21.472 --> 20:23.068
because I would make
such a good president

20:23.069 --> 20:25.381
and I really care
about this school.

20:25.382 --> 20:26.249
Why?

20:26.250 --> 20:27.369
Why?

20:29.176 --> 20:32.000
Because we spend more time
here than we do at home

20:32.001 --> 20:34.292
and we deserve a ceiling that
doesn't fall on us

20:34.293 --> 20:37.367
and we deserve lockers that
actually work right

20:37.368 --> 20:38.800
and two lines
in the cafeteria

20:38.801 --> 20:40.088
so we can get
our food faster

20:40.089 --> 20:41.730
and actually have time
to eat it.

20:44.638 --> 20:45.225
You know what, Rae?

20:45.226 --> 20:46.233
None of that even matters now

20:46.234 --> 20:47.735
because I'm not even
going to run.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.373
You sure about that?

21:06.204 --> 21:07.548
Rae, what am I going to do?

21:08.219 --> 21:10.096
I can't watch your
back all the time.

21:17.050 --> 21:18.029
Hi.

21:19.273 --> 21:20.669
I'm Chelsea Daniels...

21:21.953 --> 21:23.408
and I want to be your president.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.601
86. Guess
I changed your vision.

21:44.602 --> 21:46.044
You sure did, girl.

21:46.045 --> 21:48.250
And you lost
all on your own.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.541
I'm so proud of you.

21:53.095 --> 21:54.568
We want more vending machines... Done.

21:54.569 --> 21:55.851
increased library time
Fine.

21:55.852 --> 21:57.518
and air conditioning
in the summer.

21:57.519 --> 21:59.607
Oh, I can't.
It's a budget thing.

21:59.608 --> 22:00.763
It's impossible.

22:01.549 --> 22:02.897
We want it!

22:02.898 --> 22:04.211
You've got it.

22:08.064 --> 22:09.292
Score!
