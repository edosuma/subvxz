WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:04.238
- Ugh, where is this guy?

00:04.272 --> 00:05.582
Deal was supposed to
go down ten minutes ago.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.108
Stupid criminals have no respect

00:07.141 --> 00:08.385
for the people
trying to bust them.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.111
- Yeah, I really wish
he'd show up.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.388
I gotta go to
the bathroom so bad.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.281
- That's, like,
the third time today, man.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.092
- What is going on with you?
- Oh, Amy freaked out

00:15.116 --> 00:16.393
'cause I told her
I never drink water

00:16.417 --> 00:18.295
so now she's making me drink
eight glasses a day.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.121
It's, like,
there's water in soda,

00:20.154 --> 00:21.389
there's water in coffee,

00:21.422 --> 00:23.257
there's little pools
of water on pizza.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.801
- That's grease, Jake.
- Well, it's wet, isn't it?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.227
- It's our guy.
- Billy Ocampo.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.595
Deal's going down.
Let's go.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.163
- All right,
and then we're gonna pee.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.633
- Count.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.235
- NYPD! Freeze!

00:34.268 --> 00:36.270
- Cops!
- We got a jackrabbit.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.345
Ah! Damn it.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.648
Ocampo got away.
What happened to him?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.350
- Dumb-dumb tried
to jump down the stairs.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.452
Shattered his ankle.
Foot's all floppy.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.163
- Great, let's get 'em
back to the Nine-Nine,

00:53.187 --> 00:54.298
see if Floppy Foot
and his friend

00:54.322 --> 00:55.623
know where our man's hiding.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.326
- They don't know anything.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.827
They're undercover cops.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.329
- Floppy Foot's a cop?

01:01.362 --> 01:04.165
- Crap, that's Lieutenant
Melanie Hawkins.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.300
- I know.
- She's literally my hero.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.136
Hello, Lieutenant Hawkins.

01:08.169 --> 01:12.306
- You idiots just ruined
a three-month operation.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.309
- My name is Detective
Ignatius Pennyfeather IX.

01:15.343 --> 01:19.180
That's I-G...

01:19.213 --> 01:20.213
Nacious.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.234 --> 01:41.511
- These two bozos screwed up
a three-month operation.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.471
- Well, this sucks.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.914
Lieutenant Hawkins is my idol,
and now she hates me.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.374
- She is so cool.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.875
She's been buried alive
three times.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.477
I've only been
buried alive once.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.288
- I heard she doesn't let anyone
take her photograph

01:51.312 --> 01:53.147
so that she can
still go undercover.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.291
Hey, Rosa, delete all
the pictures you have of me.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.683
- I don't have any.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.684
- Not even the
Splash Mountain one?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.319
Oh. Here comes Holt.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.488
- Well, Hawkins
is more enraged than ever.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.157
- Why? Ocampo's just
a low-level fence.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.392
- She wanted to use him

02:04.425 --> 02:05.535
to get to the
Golden Gang bank robbers.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.361
She thinks he's their fence.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.729
- Golden Gang? Damn.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.240
Those guys just hit
a bank in Bushwick,

02:10.264 --> 02:12.166
took 6 mil in diamonds.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.335
- That is a big deal.
- She should be mad at us.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.238
- You two, get in here.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.540
- You're in God's hands now.
- Good-bye.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.375
- You tank the operation,

02:21.409 --> 02:23.277
and you put one of my men
out of commission.

02:23.311 --> 02:26.247
I am this close to suspending
the both of you.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.258
- Almost looked like your
fingers were actually touching.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.526
- We're sorry
our signals got crossed.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.285
This is everything
we have on Ocampo.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.221
- Yeah, we've been on his tail
for a while.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.522
We know everything about him,

02:34.555 --> 02:37.325
all the way down to
his favorite fro-yo flavor...

02:37.358 --> 02:39.393
Monkeyberry Marshmallow Blaster.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.929
- The point is,
we can help you find him.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.398
- You wanna help?
- Stop looking for Ocampo,

02:44.432 --> 02:47.435
and stay away from my case.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.403
- Sounds good.
- We will definitely stop...

02:49.437 --> 02:51.205
not looking for him.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.416
We're gonna find Ocampo for her,

02:52.440 --> 02:53.750
and then she's not
gonna be mad anymore.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.409
- Dope.
- Dope indeed.

02:59.247 --> 03:02.216
I swear, I would rather
drink ginger ale, Rosa.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.218
Honestly! Ginger ale!

03:04.252 --> 03:06.587
- So a guy got stabbed
at 3rd and Union.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.757
You know what that means.
I got 3rd Street bagels!

03:11.425 --> 03:13.394
- Wow, it's so nice
and surprising

03:13.427 --> 03:14.995
- when somebody thinks of others.
- Nah.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.431
- Scully...
- I was thinking of you.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.467
I was thinking about
how stupid your face is.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.335
- That's it!

03:21.369 --> 03:22.812
I'm licking all these bagels.
You get none!

03:22.836 --> 03:24.572
- Oh, you think
your spit's gonna stop me?

03:24.605 --> 03:27.408
Brother, you don't
know me at all.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.443
- Mmm!
- Ugh, what are we watching?

03:29.477 --> 03:30.820
- They've been fighting
like little kids all morning,

03:30.844 --> 03:32.480
and I can't get 'em to stop.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.249
I tried everything,
ordering them to stop and...

03:35.283 --> 03:36.784
Well, that's really all I tried.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.595
But I'm their superior officer.
That should've worked.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.255
- Guys, why are you fighting?
- You're best friends.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.590
- Every Sunday after church,

03:42.623 --> 03:45.326
Scully and I have
dinner together at Wing Sluts.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.470
- We know. You get ribs
and White Russians

03:46.494 --> 03:47.828
and watch "Undercover Boss."

03:47.861 --> 03:49.273
- Last night,
Scully said he was sick,

03:49.297 --> 03:50.564
so I went by myself.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.267
Guess who was there,
healthy as a clam?

03:53.301 --> 03:55.603
Mr. Liar
and his new tart Cindy Shatz.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.605
What happened to our bro code?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.040
- Badge before va...
- Hitchcock, no.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.610
- You always get mad
when I spend time with Cindy,

04:02.643 --> 04:05.446
so I lied, because I didn't
want you to throw a fit...

04:05.479 --> 04:07.815
- Ya cuck.
- You're the cuck, snowflake!

04:07.848 --> 04:09.817
- No, you are!
- Gina, as you know,

04:09.850 --> 04:12.420
my fountain pen is being
re-nibbed in Germany.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.522
- Yes, it's all
no one is talking about.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.325
- Due to its absence,
I borrowed Amy's favorite pen,

04:17.358 --> 04:19.360
and... I lost it.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.362
- That pen is her best friend.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.872
I'm not even saying that
as an insult.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.832
I've heard her say it.
How'd you lose it?

04:24.865 --> 04:27.301
- I have a COMPSTAT
presentation coming up,

04:27.335 --> 04:30.304
and I was toying with the idea
of using hand gestures,

04:30.338 --> 04:31.639
for emphasis,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.641
so I went out on the roof
to practice...

04:33.674 --> 04:35.476
And, ladies and gentlemen,

04:35.509 --> 04:38.546
violent crime
has gone down by 10 perce...

04:40.548 --> 04:43.484
Amy is going to be very angry,
maybe even angrier

04:43.517 --> 04:45.386
than when they added "YOLO"
to the dictionary.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.321
- You know,
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.623
Amy's, like, physically
incapable of being mad at you.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.067
- I don't think
she'll be disrespectful,

04:51.091 --> 04:52.460
but certainly she'll be upset.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.895
- Ehh... watch this.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.665
Amy,
someone lost your pen, girl.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.533
- Gina, you better be joking.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.645
That pen is my best friend,
and I will straight up...

05:01.669 --> 05:03.404
- It was Captain Holt.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.539
- Oh, that's fine.
- It's just a pen.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.675
- It's just a pen.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.678
Hey, so I talked to my C.I.s,

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
and nobody's heard
anything about Ocampo,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.382
but I talked to Skeezy J,

05:14.415 --> 05:15.892
who said he's been taking
night classes.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.352
He wants to be a dietician.
I'm excited for him.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.663
- Hawkins knows
we're working the case.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.431
- I highly doubt it.
- What makes you say that?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.890
- She just called and said,

05:22.923 --> 05:24.668
"Get over here.
I know you're working the case."

05:24.692 --> 05:26.594
- Hmm, so it appears
you were onto something.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.897
Very good. TouchÃ©.
Well, off to death.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.732
- This place is awesome.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.577
I've always wanted to work
in a covert facility.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.403
- I know. We're in
a black site, Rosa.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.405
I bet they have
some awesome name for it.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.640
- Welcome to the Slaughterhouse.
- Told ya.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.542
Hey, so listen,

05:41.575 --> 05:42.952
we know you told us
to stop looking for Ocampo,

05:42.976 --> 05:44.512
but we figured
we'd find him for you,

05:44.545 --> 05:45.613
try and make things right.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.548
- It's all good.
- I'm not mad.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.150
I checked out your files.
You guys do good stuff.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.919
I think you might be
our best option

05:51.952 --> 05:53.730
at finding this guy again.
You think you can do that?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.589
- Can a paring knife
remove a human heart

05:55.623 --> 05:57.434
- in under a minute?
- Yes, I've seen it happen.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.926
- Lucky.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.537
- So why don't you both
come back tomorrow

06:00.561 --> 06:01.771
and we can start
working this together?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.631
And, who knows,
if you find the guy,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.166
I got an open spot on my squad.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.601
Maybe one of you could fill it.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.737
- Or maybe one of us
could fill it.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.605
- Excuse me?
- What you said... better.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.741
Rosa, leave now?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.443
This is amazing.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.786
I've always wanted to be
on that squad.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.488
- Me too. Working with her
would be insane.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.947
- What do we do?

06:19.980 --> 06:21.658
I mean, there's only one spot
and the two of us,

06:21.682 --> 06:23.551
unless one of us
wanted to back off

06:23.584 --> 06:25.753
because the other said it first.
That seems fair.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.564
- Look, none of this matters
if we don't find Ocampo.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.156
Let's just do our jobs,

06:29.189 --> 06:30.767
and Hawkins will do
whatever she's gonna do.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.426
Doesn't have to be
a competition, right?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.495
- Right. Right?
- Right.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.465
- Right?
- Right.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.500
Right.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.071
- So based on
these phone records,

06:44.104 --> 06:45.482
we think Ocampo
is definitely still in Brooklyn.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.107
Is it true

06:47.140 --> 06:48.809
you still have a bullet
lodged in your hip

06:48.842 --> 06:50.119
from your shootout with
the Canarsie Killer?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.779
- No.
- Darn.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.980
- It's in my jaw.
- Yes.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.782
- This is nice work, guys.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.750
Who figured out
he was cloning his credit card?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.061
- Oh, uh, couldn't tell you.
- I don't know.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.787
- Can't remember.
- Yeah, can't recall.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.021
- We don't really keep score.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.823
- Yeah, we're super
non-competitive.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.858
- Great.
- So what's our next move?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.827
How do we find this guy?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.104
- I say we tap
his brother's phone.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
They're tight.
He'll definitely call.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.532
- Jake, you agree?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.933
- Yes, I think
that's a great idea.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.868
Fully support that.
Totally love it.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.570
The one thing
I will say, though,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.872
is, it could take us a while
to get a warrant.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.574
And we know
he's hard up for cash,

07:20.608 --> 07:22.085
and we also know
that's his primary buyer,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.578
so we could see
what this guy knows.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.014
- Both smart suggestions.
- I say we do...

07:28.882 --> 07:30.851
- Peralta's.
- Yes.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.953
Sorry, it's... muscle spasm.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.955
- Whatever.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.557
- Diaz, you ride?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.859
- Yeah, I got a supercharged R1.
- Engine?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.861
- 4-stroke, in-line four
with dual overhead cams.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.596
- Wow, that's a lot of bike.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.566
I ride a custom-6
L-capacity superbike.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.501
- What is that?
- Like, 180 horses?

07:47.535 --> 07:49.603
- 210.
- Purrs like a puma in heat.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.038
- I also ride motorcycles.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.606
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you ride?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.608
- Oh, it's in the shop
right now.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.076
Yeah, the torque felt low,

07:56.109 --> 07:58.145
so I was like,
"Bro, we gots to up the torque."

07:58.178 --> 08:00.113
We all know how it is.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.025
Anyways, I could talk about
my steel horse all darn day.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.985
We got work to do.
Rosa.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.821
- Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully
are out of control.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.633
They got into a fight
over the ranch dressing,

08:09.657 --> 08:11.058
and now it's everywhere.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.527
I figured it out, Boyle.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.095
They've been acting like kids,

08:15.128 --> 08:17.130
so I'm gonna
treat 'em like kids.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.100
- Ooh, Daddy's gonna dish out
some Daddy discipline.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.035
As a fellow daddy, I approve.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.909
- Stop saying "daddy."
- You got it, Papa Bear.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.906
- Hmm, I actually
kinda like that one.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.641
Makes me feel strong.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.543
Anyway, I'm gonna take away
something they love

08:29.577 --> 08:30.911
until they stop fighting.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.546
- Papa Bear punishment.
- Daddy like!

08:32.580 --> 08:35.649
- Boyle!
- You two, up now!

08:35.683 --> 08:38.552
I'm taking away the thing
you love most in the world.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.820
Sitting.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.087
You'll get your chairs back

08:41.121 --> 08:42.556
when you apologize
to each other.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.658
- Fine.
- I'm sorry...

08:44.692 --> 08:47.194
I ever met you, you bald freak!

08:47.227 --> 08:50.564
- Don't you push my desk,
you basic bitch!

08:50.598 --> 08:51.599
- Guys, enough.
- Guys...

08:51.632 --> 08:53.000
- Freak!
- Biatch!

08:53.033 --> 08:54.713
- Oh, the ranch.
- It's all over the floor.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.640
- Oh!
- Oh!

09:02.643 --> 09:03.977
- Ocampo?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.579
Nah, haven't seen him in months.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.581
- I don't know how to reach him.
- Okay.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.158
Then I guess we'll just set up
surveillance here full-time.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.952
I'm sure your shady customers
will love that.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.988
- Oh, well, I...
- Tell me where he is.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.190
I'm gonna count to three.
There will not be a four.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.159
- Okay, fine,
he was here this morning,

09:19.192 --> 09:21.161
but I didn't buy anything.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.172
Here, he left this number
in case I change my mind.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.198
- Uh, thank you.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.201
- Here you go, Lieutenant.
- "There will not be a four."

09:28.235 --> 09:30.070
"Die Hard." Nice.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.072
- You like "Die Hard"?
- Best movie ever.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.707
- Best franchise ever.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.709
I even have the Justin Long one
on Blu-ray.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.611
- I saw the fifth one
in the theaters.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.055
- So did I! Wait, there was
only one other person there.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.714
- Was that you?
- Atlantic Avenue?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.158
- No, but that would've been
a cool coincidence.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.652
- I also like "Die Hard."

09:44.685 --> 09:46.887
- Really, Rosa?
- What's your favorite part?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.031
- The shootouts.
- Interesting.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.057
Vague and interesting.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.692
But it's funny
'cause I always thought

09:51.725 --> 09:53.727
your favorite movies
were made by Nancy Meyers.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.128
- Seriously?
- What? No.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.030
- I hate that crap.
- Really?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.175
So you hate the one starring
Diane Keaton and John Wick?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.101
- What was it called again?
- I don't know.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.646
- "Something Has to Give"?
- "Something's Gotta Give."

10:02.670 --> 10:04.271
I got ya.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.174
- Can I get a trace on
this number right away, please?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.710
- No need.
- We know where Ocampo is.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.244
We got the warrant
for Diaz's tap.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.756
He called his brother
and arranged a meet-up.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.281
It's about to go down.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.959
- So it looks like
my idea worked after all.

10:15.983 --> 10:16.950
- Did it, though?
- Yes, it did.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.752
Nice job, Diaz.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.296
Come on, suit up, everyone.
We gotta go right away.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.098
- Sounds good.
- Maybe we should take our bikes.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.191
- Cool idea, but is it
the best move tactically?

10:24.224 --> 10:26.002
- Yes, it is. That way,
we can slip through traffic.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.661
- Totally.
- However, as mentioned,

10:27.695 --> 10:30.030
my hog is up in the torque shop,

10:30.063 --> 10:33.033
just getting...
torqued up the hog,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.769
so we should probably
just share one car over there.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.971
- Ah, I bet you Floppy Foot
will loan you his bike.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.049
- And yet, I don't want to
inconvenience Floppy Foot.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.317
- Sure he wouldn't mind.
- Right.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.976
Even so, it's not like
we have his keys.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.745
- Uh, look at that.
- Let's go.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.213
- You found them.
- That's fun.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.016
I can't wait
to drive this motorcycle

10:49.049 --> 10:50.449
that I definitely
know how to drive.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.090
Too much torque!

10:57.124 --> 10:58.759
Too much torque!

10:58.792 --> 11:01.695
- Santiago, I've been
your CO for four years.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.064
By now, you should be able
to stand up for yourself,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.699
even if that means
telling me off.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.134
- You're right.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.745
Just say the word,
and I will tell you off.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.104
- Okay, tell me off
about losing your pen.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.073
- Oh. Right now?

11:13.106 --> 11:17.310
Okay, well, it makes me
feel pretty annoyed.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.247
- Good. Go on.
- It grates my cheese.

11:20.280 --> 11:25.085
I mean, it just really
grates my cheese.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.219
Grr!

11:26.253 --> 11:28.288
- Oh, Santiago, you're faking.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.290
- Faking? What?

11:30.323 --> 11:32.726
Uh, did you hear that "grr"?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.161
- Just admit it.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
- Okay, fine,
I was faking the whole time,

11:36.129 --> 11:38.107
but I only did it because
I wanted you to enjoy it.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.733
- That ruins it.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.277
I mean, it's supposed to be
good for both of us.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.146
- It was good.
- Just because I didn't get angry

11:43.170 --> 11:45.072
doesn't mean I didn't get
anything out of it.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.841
- Yeah, but the whole point
is for you to get angry.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.010
- Did you even get close?
- Uh...

11:50.043 --> 11:52.012
- What about your last CO?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.114
- Could he make you angry?
- Well, he...

11:54.147 --> 11:55.291
- You know what?
- I don't wanna know.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.785
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.228
Did you find him?
Where is everybody?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.867
- They already left.
- Ocampo wasn't here.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.859
He must've heard us coming
or something.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.237
- Did you enjoy your ride over?
- I think you know I didn't.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.873
- Well, maybe you shouldn't
have brought up Nancy Meyers.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.832
- Oh, okay,
I see what's happening.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.334
This is a competition.
We're officially competing.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.179
- Oh, yeah, we're competing.
- Fine, then it's on,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.772
and I'm gonna crush you.
Also, I need a ride.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.774
Can I please sit on
the back of your motorcycle?

12:20.808 --> 12:21.842
- No.
- Well played.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.176
Looks like I'm gonna find out

12:23.210 --> 12:25.112
if a motorcycle
fits on the subway.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.184
- Ugh, I gotta find Ocampo
before Rosa does.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.153
I'm so wound up!
I can't focus!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.198
- Oh, are you flipping out
about Tiandra getting kicked off

12:35.222 --> 12:38.091
- "So You Think You Can Dance"?
- Definitely not.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.061
- Well, you should be.
- Her Nay Nay was nonpareil.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.163
- I know what's happening.
- I'm finally hydrated,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.098
and it's unlocking
my brain's full potential.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.100
It's too much for me.
I'm "Limitless" -ing.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.036
- I don't think
water makes you jittery.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.904
- It does if it's laced
with caffeine.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.077
- You dosed my water?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.146
- You just drank
960 cups of coffee.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.114
- Oh, that esprains
why I no talk butter.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.050
Me having stirk?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.085
Good luck solving that case.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.020
Why would you drink more?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.989
- My brain wants its fast juice.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.925
- Hey.
- Why are you in here?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.169
- I'm hiding from
Hitchcock and Scully.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.028
I can't take anymore.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.865
They got into a meatball fight
at breakfast.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.900
They win.
The bullpen is theirs.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.101
- No way, Papa Bear.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.311
When Nikolaj
and his best friend fight,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.204
I have them do
an activity together,

13:24.237 --> 13:26.306
like a puppy puzzle.
Makes 'em cooperate.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.909
- So are you saying we give
Hitchcock and Scully a case

13:28.942 --> 13:30.277
and make 'em work it together?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.046
- No, no, no, we give them...
- a puppy puzzle.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.216
Now let's go to town on 'em
daddy-style.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.219
All right, I need you guys
to assemble this jigsaw puzzle

13:39.252 --> 13:40.954
for a case I'm working on.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.131
- Why do we have to
do it together?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.958
- Yeah.
- Uh... 'cause?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.194
- Can't argue with that.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.162
- Cooperation
instead of punishment.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.098
Damn, Boyle,

13:51.131 --> 13:52.876
that is some advanced level
parenting right there.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.210
- I learned from the best...
- Thank you.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.103
- Lorelai from "Gilmore Girls."
- Okay.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.981
- I guess being a daddy
just comes naturally to me.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.873
Die!

13:59.907 --> 14:01.308
- Hitchcock, no!
- Die!

14:03.343 --> 14:05.245
- How's it going?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.190
Ah, I noticed your pupils
have stopped pulsating.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.524
- Yeah, because I found
the perfect antidote

14:08.548 --> 14:10.017
to your little prank.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.919
Sure, caffeine speeds you up,

14:11.952 --> 14:14.554
but half-and-half
slows you down.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.995
Ah, dairy.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.132
You made one fatal mistake.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.100
You forgot how gross I am.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.202
- Yep. Oh, now feels like
a good time to tell you

14:29.236 --> 14:31.004
I dosed that half-and-half
with caffeine.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.348
- Come on!
- What are you two up to?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.374
- Being normal. Why?
- Not misbehaving. What?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.910
- Huh, Skeezy J just called.
- Oh, did he pass his final?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.979
- No, but he said,
"Ocampo's in a warehouse

14:39.012 --> 14:41.148
on the corner
of Richards and Lefferts."

14:43.150 --> 14:45.285
Uh...

14:45.318 --> 14:48.155
What's wrong, Rosa? Out of gas?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.961
Yeah, it got all in my mouth.
It was horrible.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.197
But still not as bad as water.
See ya never!

14:57.230 --> 15:00.100
- What's wrong, Jake?
- Out of steering wheels?

15:00.133 --> 15:03.203
- You know that I am!
- That's okay. I can run too.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.239
Oh, the half-and-half
just met the gasoline.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.175
They're not mixing well.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.950
- Sir, are you all right?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.385
- I failed you, Santiago.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.363
I want my officers to
respect the chain of command,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.389
but I never want anyone
to be so terrified of me

15:22.422 --> 15:25.058
that they repress
basic emotions.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.960
- I'm a terrible captain.
- Stop that.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.234
You are not a terrible captain.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.297
- Santiago, face facts.
- I'm garbage.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.201
- No, this is about me
and my issues with authority.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.403
- You've been great.
- Wrong, I've been a disaster.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.314
- I can't believe you would
blame yourself for this.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.173
- How stupid are you?
- So stupid.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.085
- I'm such a stupid head.
- The fact that you think

15:42.109 --> 15:44.411
this has anything
to do with you is insane.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.346
Do you even...
Oh, my God, I'm yelling at you.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.981
- Yes, you are.
- You're in the zone.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.150
- Keep going.
- Oh, okay.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.086
I can't believe you lost my pen.
That was careless and rude!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.255
- And?
- And it was a real jerk move!

15:55.288 --> 15:58.258
- Santiago! You did it!
- And I am so sick of you

15:58.291 --> 16:01.094
playing your damn classical
music in your office all day.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
It's too loud!
We can all hear it!

16:03.130 --> 16:04.464
- Okay, well, this has been...

16:04.497 --> 16:06.142
- You shut your mouth
when I'm talking to you.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.068
- Santiago...
- Right, too far.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.237
I'm sorry.
This is all very new for me.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.174
- Son of a bitch.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.175
Where'd you find
a steering wheel?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.077
- I didn't.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.121
I had a Frisbee in the trunk,
and I taped it on.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.379
That's right.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.489
I MacGyvered
the donk out of this thing,

16:20.513 --> 16:22.415
and it worked flawlessly.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.260
Actually, I hit a ton of stuff
on the way over here.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.461
- It was awful.
- Of course you did.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.453
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.121
This is the warehouse.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.090
Listen, I know
we're competing, but...

16:30.123 --> 16:31.334
- We can't let him get away.
- We should work this together.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.026
- Okay, but the second
that we find him...

16:33.060 --> 16:34.137
- We go back to being
arch rivals.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.029
No two ways about it.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.141
- Yep, I'll boil your flesh
and drink from your skull.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.200
- Yeah, totally.
- I'll do that to you too,

16:40.233 --> 16:43.336
if I win.
We're both lunatics.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.273
NYPD! Down on the ground!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.407
- Ocampo, freeze!

16:58.085 --> 16:59.419
What are you doing?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.188
- He went outside.
- Feels like a setup.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.331
I mean, he could have
opened the door

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
but stayed inside to trick us.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.258
- No way.
- This guy is not that smart.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.335
We could split up,
follow our hunches.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.694
- Winner takes all.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.298
- Dummy.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.304
NYPD! Put your hands
where I can see them!

17:17.337 --> 17:19.106
Oh, my God.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.315
- Damn it.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.488
You're under arrest.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.333
Also, I'm gonna have to pee
while I hold you at gunpoint.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.637
I've been drinking
so much water.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.396
- Hey.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.640
Before we take Ocampo
over to the Slaughterhouse,

17:44.664 --> 17:46.733
I just wanted to
make sure you were okay,

17:46.766 --> 17:49.669
'cause you are sharpening
that knife very intensely.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.371
- Makes me feel better.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.306
- I'm the same way
with "MAD" magazine

17:53.340 --> 17:55.308
and "Cracked" magazine.
Ah, they're both so good.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.685
Tough to pick.
I mean, "MAD" is the original,

17:56.709 --> 17:58.545
but "Cracked"...
They've always got a take.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.747
- Okay, I'm done.
- Let's go.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.549
- Wait.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.826
Look, I know it sucks
there's only one spot,

18:03.850 --> 18:06.519
but working for Hawkins
is my dream.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.431
I mean, she takes down the
biggest criminals in the city.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.323
- I get it.
- Dude, it's just,

18:10.357 --> 18:11.834
our captain's a man,
our sergeant's a man.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.661
Every superior officer
I've ever had has been a man.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.529
It just seemed cool
to work for a badass woman

18:16.563 --> 18:18.498
like Hawkins for once,
but whatever, I'm good.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.835
Also, I spiked your gum
with caffeine.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.571
- How?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.807
- Face it, Charles,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.442
we couldn't make 'em get along.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.710
We failed as parents.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.679
- Why did I think
I knew what I was doing?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.681
Poor Nikolaj.
His life is ruined.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.450
- My God, you two are fools.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.591
Your folly was in
treating them as children.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.460
- Of course, we should've been
treating 'em like adults.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.828
- No, wrong again.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.597
They're not children.
They're not adults.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.733
They're animals...
Filthy, wild animals...

18:53.766 --> 18:55.502
And they need to be
treated accordingly.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.637
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it right now!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.706
But he won't let me...

19:02.509 --> 19:07.380
- You two gonna be friends now?
- No? Okay, fine, yeah.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.383
Who wants a cookie?
Ah, let me hear you apologize.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.652
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, better apology, please.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.721
- I'm sorry for neglecting
our friendship.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.556
- You're my best friend.
- Your turn.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.625
- Well, I'm sorry too.
- You're my best friend.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.460
- Good boys!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.562
Stay.
Stay, stay.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.397
Eat it!

19:24.431 --> 19:27.634
God, I'm gonna make
a great dad someday.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.438
- You got Ocampo?
- Oh, yeah,

19:31.471 --> 19:33.506
and you'll never guess
where we found him.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.775
In the bathroom...
not going.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.777
He was hiding.
I ruined the story.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.513
- Did he give you any info about
the Golden Gang bank robbers?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.790
- No, we thought
we'd leave that to you.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.616
- Well, I appreciate that.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.852
So who found him?

19:45.885 --> 19:47.754
- Who's gonna join my squad?
- Jake.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.889
- Thank you, Rosa,
for introducing me.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.858
Yes, I am Jake,
and I'm announcing that

19:51.891 --> 19:54.561
the person joining your
task force is Detective Diaz.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.596
- What? No, you found him.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.640
- Because you said
we should split up.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.865
It was the correct call.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.667
- Yeah, but you brought him in.
- You won.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.910
- Agree to disagree.
- I say you won.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.670
- I think you won.
- I say you won.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.538
- Dude, you clearly won...
- Shut up!

20:05.572 --> 20:07.774
You've got each other's backs.
I like that.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.610
Loyalty is the most
important thing to me,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.545
so I tell you what I'm gonna do.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.557
How about I'm gonna put you
both on the task force?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.450
- Oh, okay, whatever.
- That works, I guess.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.927
- It's fine idea.
- Not that we really cared.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.696
- I wasn't really listening.
- What are we talking about?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.590
- Ah! We got it!
- Ah!

20:23.623 --> 20:26.526
Wait a minute. Are we hugging?
Have we ever done this before?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.903
- No, and if you tell anyone,
I'll slit your throat.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.696
- Oh.
- Thank you so much, Jake.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
- Please.
- I'm just glad you finally

20:31.598 --> 20:32.841
get to work for a woman
as badass as you are.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.934
And as a man,
I'd like to apologize

20:34.967 --> 20:36.736
- for my gender's history...
- Don't ruin it.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.913
- Okay.
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink

20:37.937 --> 20:39.839
that doesn't have
any pills in it.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.584
- Sounds good, but I wish
you hadn't mentioned liquid.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.818
Now I have to pee.
I promise you

20:42.842 --> 20:44.544
I will never drink water
ever again.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.713
- Thank God.
- It's the worst. BRB.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.821
- Did you tell 'em anything?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.924
- No, they have no idea
what's really going on.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.792
- Pretty.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.794
See how much you can
get me for these, hmm?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.764
Try not to get caught this time.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.733
- Oh, no.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.668
She dirty.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.904
- Not a doctor. Shh.
