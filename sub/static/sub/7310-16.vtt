WEBVTT

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
Hey.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.300
Be right there.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.200
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.700
Elvis has left the building.

01:38.900 --> 01:39.900
Yeah, we got it.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.600
Get in there, DiNozzo.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.700
On my way, boss.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.700
So where are we going
on this... mystery date?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.900
Well, it wouldn't be a
mystery if I told you, Gina.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.400
Should I have brought my toothbrush?

02:02.300 --> 02:03.900
Going right on Connecticut.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.700
- You left the bar early last night.
- Yes.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.400
My husband was calling from Fallujah.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
- What did you do when I left?
- Nothing.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.500
Went home, went to bed.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.200
Should I get on the expressway?

02:17.700 --> 02:18.700
Nope.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.400
I like a man who keeps secrets.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.500
- What's the gap?
- Almost two blocks.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.700
- Boss...
- You done?

02:58.900 --> 03:01.100
Don't need the bugs, boss,
got Hoffman's latest victim.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.500
Number five.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.200
Female Caucasian, mid to late twenties.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.100
Dead on the living room floor.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.600
What about the finger?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.100
Yep, missing a finger.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.800
Call Ziva... give her the distress code.
Tell her we're taking Hoffman down now.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
Hello.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.700
Bernard?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.700
No, you've got the wrong number.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.100
If you're not going to
tell me where we are going,

03:36.200 --> 03:37.900
I'm gonna need a ladies' room.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.000
- What are you doing?
- Who's Gibbs?

03:44.900 --> 03:45.900
Wrong number.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
His name's number two
on your speed dial.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.100
He was an ex-boyfriend, okay?

03:50.600 --> 03:53.000
Can I have my phone back, please?

03:55.100 --> 03:56.100
Drive.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.300
They just turned west.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.200
All right, the car is
stopped two blocks ahead.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.800
You're a cop, aren't you?

04:31.300 --> 04:32.900
Why did you kill those women, Andy?

04:33.300 --> 04:34.400
For their husbands.

04:34.700 --> 04:35.900
Save them the humiliation

04:36.000 --> 04:38.500
of finding out that their wives
were screwing around on them

04:38.535 --> 04:40.500
while they were serving their country.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.700
Is that what happened to you?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
You don't need to know
what happened to me.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.100
Walk.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.400
Get in there.

05:45.700 --> 05:46.700
Ziva!

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
Ziva.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.100
Come on.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.400
You all right?

06:20.252 --> 06:21.852
Sorry.

06:22.595 --> 06:24.195
She should go for X-ray.

06:24.395 --> 06:25.495
I am fine.

06:26.195 --> 06:27.295
You don't look fine.

06:27.395 --> 06:29.995
Well, don't stand there,
Mr. Palmer, get the gurney.

06:30.095 --> 06:32.195
- Yes, doctor.
- He did not hurt me.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.695
Need your clothes.

06:35.995 --> 06:36.995
Get changed,

06:37.295 --> 06:38.295
get an X-ray,

06:38.330 --> 06:39.330
go home.

06:40.195 --> 06:42.095
I don't need to see you again today.

06:58.395 --> 07:01.495
Where the hell are you, McTardy? I'm
still here alone with the dead body.

07:01.795 --> 07:04.695
We're still processing our own,
Tony. We'll be there soon as we can.

07:04.730 --> 07:05.730
How's Ziva?

07:06.795 --> 07:07.895
Pretty shaken up.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.495
- Keep me updated.
- I will.

07:13.495 --> 07:14.995
Finally got the dirtbag.

07:15.495 --> 07:17.695
His name's Andrew
Hoffman. You heard of him?

07:18.595 --> 07:19.595
No.

07:19.895 --> 07:21.595
But I hear you've got another body.

07:21.995 --> 07:23.195
Victim number five.

07:23.395 --> 07:24.495
Military wife?

07:24.695 --> 07:25.795
Don't know yet.

07:27.195 --> 07:29.460
- How'd you get on to Hoffman?
- Officer David

07:29.495 --> 07:32.595
was working undercover in the bar
where two of the victims were last seen.

07:32.795 --> 07:36.595
Planning to do the same thing ourselves
if you guys hadn't taken over the case.

07:36.695 --> 07:39.295
You know, Rosetti, I don't
think Hoffman is your type.

07:48.595 --> 07:50.095
Nice work, David.

07:53.595 --> 07:55.695
I'll get someone to
take you to the hospital.

07:56.795 --> 07:58.295
I can give you a lift.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.795
No, I'm fine, Detective.

08:02.495 --> 08:05.195
I'm fine, really, thank you.

08:27.895 --> 08:29.095
I told you to go home.

08:29.195 --> 08:31.095
My statement is on your desk.

08:31.195 --> 08:32.794
Have you identified the last victim?

08:33.195 --> 08:34.195
No.

08:39.195 --> 08:42.294
I thought I would go back to
the bar where I met Hoffman,

08:42.495 --> 08:43.695
show the victim's photo.

08:44.595 --> 08:45.895
Do you have a face shot?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.195
Yeah, I'll print one.

08:53.095 --> 08:54.795
You stay with her, DiNozzo.

08:55.695 --> 08:56.695
Okay.

09:00.795 --> 09:01.795
What?

09:02.095 --> 09:03.295
You don't look so bad.

09:04.395 --> 09:05.895
McGee said you were a wreck.

09:10.195 --> 09:11.695
I was just gonna tussle your hair.

09:12.895 --> 09:14.695
Sometimes it makes you smile.

09:17.695 --> 09:18.695
Sorry.

09:19.295 --> 09:21.195
A fifth, still unidentified victim

09:21.295 --> 09:23.995
was found this afternoon
inside Hoffman's home.

09:24.195 --> 09:27.295
His shooting death by
an undercover NCIS agent

09:27.495 --> 09:30.195
ends the series of brutal
murders of military wives

09:30.295 --> 09:32.795
found in war memorials around DC.

09:32.895 --> 09:36.295
The murders have been taking
place over the last two months...

09:38.295 --> 09:40.395
- I'll take the bartender.
- Her name is Heidi.

09:42.095 --> 09:43.095
Hidey-ho.

09:44.295 --> 09:46.295
Gina, you hear about Andy Hoffman,

09:46.795 --> 09:48.795
- guy that sits at the end of the bar?
- Yes.

09:48.995 --> 09:50.795
You were just talking
to him the other night.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.495
- Can you believe he would...
- Michael.

09:52.695 --> 09:54.995
My name is, not Gina.

09:55.695 --> 09:56.995
My name is Ziva.

09:59.195 --> 10:01.295
You're an undercover
cop? That... that was you?

10:01.395 --> 10:02.995
I'm a federal agent, actually.

10:03.695 --> 10:05.895
Holy crap... You never...

10:07.495 --> 10:09.795
So when you were chatting
me up, you were...

10:09.895 --> 10:11.295
I mean, you thought I might be...

10:11.395 --> 10:13.395
- Michael, I was doing my job.
- Sure,

10:14.295 --> 10:15.795
just doing your job.

10:15.895 --> 10:17.595
Have you ever seen this woman before?

10:17.795 --> 10:18.795
She's dead?

10:20.595 --> 10:22.295
She was never in here on my shift.

10:22.495 --> 10:24.295
She's the one they
found at Hoffman's house?

10:24.395 --> 10:26.095
Yes, she is.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.495
- Did you ever talk to him?
- All the time.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.195
Actually gives me the
creeps thinking about it.

10:31.495 --> 10:34.095
There's a couple of guys in here
I would've suspected before him.

10:34.195 --> 10:35.795
He ever mentioned his ex-wife?

10:35.895 --> 10:38.295
- I didn't know he was married.
- Interesting...

10:38.695 --> 10:40.895
You know who that guy is
over there in the corner?

10:41.195 --> 10:42.195
With Gina?

10:42.395 --> 10:43.895
His name is Michael.

10:43.995 --> 10:45.195
What's his story?

10:45.795 --> 10:48.795
Michael used to come in here
all the time with his girlfriend.

10:48.995 --> 10:52.995
She walked out on him a few weeks ago,
and he hasn't been able to find her.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.595
This girl's name is Julie.

10:55.895 --> 10:58.695
I don't know her surname. I
talked to her once or twice.

10:58.795 --> 11:01.795
I thought maybe she knew
Devon, my girlfriend... ex.

11:03.995 --> 11:06.095
I still haven't found
her... it's been three weeks.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.695
You don't think Hoffman...

11:10.895 --> 11:13.495
I mean, you think they're
gonna find more bodies?

11:13.995 --> 11:15.295
I hope not.

11:16.195 --> 11:17.295
I'm worried.

11:17.395 --> 11:19.995
She used to be married to a
Navy SEAL... it fits the profile.

11:22.795 --> 11:23.895
Did he do that?

11:30.895 --> 11:32.295
Name's Julie Ann Smight.

11:32.395 --> 11:35.295
Employer filed a missing person
with the Chevy Chase PD this morning.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.995
- She married?
- Yeah, to...

11:37.195 --> 11:39.295
Petty Officer First Class Donald Smight.

11:39.395 --> 11:40.995
He's aboard the U.S.S. Eisenhower.

11:41.095 --> 11:44.395
She was last seen two nights ago,
leaving a lounge on U Street...

11:44.795 --> 11:45.795
alone.

11:46.095 --> 11:49.495
Petty Officer Massey's here to pick
up his wife's personal belongings.

11:58.995 --> 12:00.195
How you holding up?

12:00.395 --> 12:01.795
I'm all right, I guess.

12:02.595 --> 12:03.760
Hope you don't mind, ma'am,

12:03.795 --> 12:05.995
but I asked Special Agent
DiNozzo to bring me up here.

12:07.595 --> 12:10.295
I wanted to thank you personally
for killing that bastard.

12:11.895 --> 12:13.995
I hope you made him
suffer for what he did.

12:16.895 --> 12:17.895
DiNozzo,

12:18.595 --> 12:20.895
take Petty Officer Massey
down to the evidence locker.

12:21.095 --> 12:22.195
Will do. This way.

12:34.395 --> 12:35.395
Hey.

12:40.295 --> 12:42.395
- What do you want, Duck?
- Jethro.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.995
I've reviewed the autopsies
of the first four victims,

12:46.095 --> 12:48.795
and I'm currently examining the fifth.

12:48.895 --> 12:50.395
All four were stabbed

12:50.695 --> 12:52.695
in the same manner with the same knife.

12:52.895 --> 12:54.995
In all five, tox screens show

12:55.295 --> 12:57.795
large amounts of Rohypnol and alcohol.

12:57.830 --> 12:58.830
But

12:58.895 --> 13:02.395
in regard to the fingers,
or lack thereof...

13:05.095 --> 13:07.995
I found a curious inconsistency.

13:08.295 --> 13:09.795
Four of the five

13:09.995 --> 13:11.595
were severed postmortem.

13:11.795 --> 13:13.695
Based on lividity and blood flow,

13:13.895 --> 13:17.395
I'd estimate several hours after death.

13:17.795 --> 13:20.095
But the finger of fourth victim...

13:21.195 --> 13:23.395
was cut off almost immediately.

13:23.695 --> 13:26.295
Maybe someone interrupted him
so he had to rush to finish it.

13:32.695 --> 13:34.095
Abby, what are you doing?

13:34.295 --> 13:35.595
Efficiency, Gibbs.

13:35.895 --> 13:39.195
I took off 14 and a half seconds from
what it usually takes me to get here.

13:39.395 --> 13:42.495
So, I estimate that I
could gain 17 minutes a day.

13:42.895 --> 13:45.595
That would be 85 minutes in a week.

13:45.795 --> 13:48.495
382 minutes in a month. So, in a year...

13:48.530 --> 13:49.530
Abs.

13:49.895 --> 13:50.895
Yes, Gibbs?

13:51.095 --> 13:52.995
Is that knife gonna tell me something?

13:54.395 --> 13:55.495
Yes and no.

13:55.695 --> 13:59.595
I mean, it definitely is the serrated
knife that severed the victims' fingers.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.560
But?

14:00.595 --> 14:02.695
But, I found a...

14:03.095 --> 14:05.295
partial print in blood on the handle.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.595
It doesn't match Hoffman
or the other victims.

14:08.295 --> 14:10.495
I don't think Hoffman was working alone.

14:19.973 --> 14:21.773
Die, you stupid machine!

14:22.173 --> 14:23.673
She seems unfazed.

14:23.973 --> 14:27.473
Those are standard Mossad style
copy machine assault tactics, McGee.

14:27.873 --> 14:28.873
She's fine.

14:29.173 --> 14:31.573
Hey, McGee thinks you're
raging against the machine

14:31.673 --> 14:34.073
'cause you had to take down
your serial killer boyfriend.

14:36.573 --> 14:37.673
Thanks for that.

14:38.773 --> 14:40.473
Ziva, I was just concerned...

14:40.573 --> 14:42.873
- I am fine.
- See? McGee?

14:43.373 --> 14:44.973
She's a steely-eyed killer.

14:45.073 --> 14:46.173
Sheket bevakasha!

14:46.373 --> 14:48.073
I don't know him.
Borscht-belt comedian?

14:48.108 --> 14:49.673
It is Hebrew. For shut up.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.173
Really did affect you, huh?

14:51.573 --> 14:53.613
Have you had your mandatory
session with the shrink?

14:55.573 --> 14:56.573
Yes.

14:56.673 --> 14:57.973
Still crazy, then?

15:00.373 --> 15:01.573
Getting off your case.

15:01.673 --> 15:03.473
Well, you can stay on this one.

15:03.573 --> 15:06.873
Abby found a partial print on the murder
weapon that does not match our killer.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.673
Hoffman had an accomplice?

15:08.773 --> 15:11.273
- That's one explanation.
- Could be a copycat killer.

15:11.373 --> 15:13.473
Copycats copy. They
don't use the same weapon.

15:14.473 --> 15:17.473
Re-examine the crime scene,
canvass Hoffman's neighborhood,

15:17.773 --> 15:19.973
take another look at
the surveillance video.

15:20.173 --> 15:21.173
Tomorrow.

15:22.873 --> 15:23.873
Go home.

15:23.973 --> 15:25.273
Been a long day.

15:25.773 --> 15:26.973
Get some rest.

15:28.173 --> 15:29.173
You.

15:30.873 --> 15:33.273
I do not need to see you here tomorrow.

15:37.973 --> 15:40.273
Anyone want to, get a drink?

15:44.273 --> 15:45.273
Drink?

15:45.473 --> 15:46.773
Not tonight, Tony.

15:51.073 --> 15:52.073
Listen...

15:52.373 --> 15:54.873
I wasn't trying to make light
of what you went through.

15:55.373 --> 15:57.673
Just trying to snap you out
of your head space, you know?

15:57.773 --> 16:00.273
I have perfectly good space in my head.

16:00.573 --> 16:01.373
Great.

16:01.473 --> 16:02.773
Then let's get a drink.

16:02.873 --> 16:04.273
You talk, I'll listen.

16:04.573 --> 16:05.973
I don't want a drink.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.173
Okay.

16:08.773 --> 16:10.673
One drink. I'll talk, you listen.

16:10.873 --> 16:11.873
Tony.

16:12.273 --> 16:13.273
No.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.673
Let me buy you the next one.

16:25.973 --> 16:27.673
- You working?
- No.

16:29.773 --> 16:31.173
No, really. I'm not working.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.473
Just...

16:32.573 --> 16:33.573
drinking.

16:33.873 --> 16:34.873
Heidi!

16:34.973 --> 16:36.173
Uno más, s'il vous plaît.

16:36.273 --> 16:38.073
- Coming up!
- You're mixing your languages.

16:38.273 --> 16:39.373
And my liquors.

16:39.773 --> 16:42.273
Not exactly the place to come
if you're not on the case.

16:42.473 --> 16:43.973
There's a thousand bars in this town.

16:44.673 --> 16:46.873
I like the atmosphere. And Heidi...

16:47.973 --> 16:49.573
makes one killer mojito.

16:49.873 --> 16:52.373
I thought maybe you took a
shine to one of the patrons.

16:55.673 --> 16:56.673
And you?

16:56.873 --> 16:58.273
You are here, no doubt,

16:58.773 --> 17:00.073
in search of Debbie?

17:00.573 --> 17:01.573
Devon.

17:01.773 --> 17:02.973
Potato, potahto.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.673
Yeah, well, not
searching. Just drinking.

17:15.272 --> 17:16.973
So, tell me about Debbie.

17:17.073 --> 17:18.272
Just kidding.

17:18.772 --> 17:19.772
Devon.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.873
Very pretty.

17:21.973 --> 17:22.973
And smart.

17:23.173 --> 17:24.173
Funny.

17:24.673 --> 17:26.373
Terrible sense of direction.

17:26.673 --> 17:29.673
Drive you insane with her
incessant movie references.

17:31.073 --> 17:33.673
Worries about others more than
herself. Generous to a fault.

17:33.873 --> 17:35.573
No wonder you're looking for her.

17:35.873 --> 17:37.173
She sounds amazing.

17:37.273 --> 17:41.173
Other than the fact that we were totally
incompatible, Devon was perfect for me.

17:42.073 --> 17:43.173
You miss her?

17:43.573 --> 17:45.673
I'm not looking to get
back with her. I just...

17:45.773 --> 17:47.073
want to know she's okay.

17:48.673 --> 17:49.873
I'm going to help you.

17:50.273 --> 17:51.373
You already have.

17:51.573 --> 17:52.573
How so?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.373
By killing Hoffman.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.073
One less nightmare.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.973
You okay?

18:05.573 --> 18:06.573
Never better.

18:24.073 --> 18:26.973
- Thought you were taking the day.
- Gibbs' idea. Not mine.

18:27.973 --> 18:29.073
That Hoffman?

18:29.673 --> 18:31.273
Yeah, I'm reviewing the tapes.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.173
Victim number three?

18:35.273 --> 18:37.373
Monica Bishop, judging by the dress.

18:37.673 --> 18:38.973
Look at this guy here.

18:40.173 --> 18:41.473
He's watching 'em.

18:41.773 --> 18:44.373
If Hoffman had an accomplice,
he could very well be him.

18:45.673 --> 18:47.673
Or he could just be a passerby.

18:48.973 --> 18:50.173
There he goes.

18:54.073 --> 18:56.573
Look, he's heading in the same
direction Hoffman took the girl.

18:56.873 --> 18:58.573
Or he could be going to a bar.

18:58.973 --> 19:01.373
Or he was checking to make
sure no one was following them,

19:01.473 --> 19:03.873
before joining Hoffman
and killing the woman.

19:04.873 --> 19:06.673
That's got to be Hoffman's accomplice.

19:09.673 --> 19:11.273
Man without a face.

19:11.573 --> 19:13.773
Spoke to the neighbors.
They barely knew Hoffman.

19:13.973 --> 19:16.173
- Guy was an enigma.
- Well, he still is.

19:16.273 --> 19:19.173
Found a stack of photos, too.
Not a woman in any of them. Just

19:19.373 --> 19:21.573
Hoffman and his Marine buddies.

19:21.773 --> 19:23.773
Any one of 'em a potential accomplice.

19:23.973 --> 19:25.338
Good a place to start as any.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.473
Gibbs, I thought we closed
the case on this one.

19:27.673 --> 19:31.373
Yeah, found a partial print on Hoffman's
knife that doesn't belong to him.

19:31.473 --> 19:33.473
Most serial killers work alone.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.273
Yeah. Most.

19:35.573 --> 19:38.223
Wouldn't be the first time a
killer worked with a partner.

19:38.258 --> 19:40.873
You got the Cook brothers,
Eric and Lyle Menendez...

19:40.973 --> 19:42.173
I wouldn't get too excited

19:42.273 --> 19:44.573
about a partial print on a
knife... it could be anything.

19:44.773 --> 19:46.973
I need to review all
the evidence you have.

19:47.073 --> 19:49.073
I already given you
everything I think is relevant.

19:49.173 --> 19:51.573
Well, then give me
everything you think isn't.

19:51.673 --> 19:54.938
Gibbs, you've got your killer,
you've got all your bodies...

19:54.973 --> 19:57.884
Most of the bodies. Five of the fingers
that he cut off the victims are missing.

19:57.908 --> 19:59.573
Doesn't mean that
there's a second killer.

19:59.673 --> 20:01.923
Well, maybe Hoffman kept
the bodies as a prize,

20:01.958 --> 20:04.173
and his accomplice got
to keep the fingers.

20:04.373 --> 20:05.473
DiNozzo.

20:05.873 --> 20:06.973
You were a cop.

20:07.273 --> 20:10.173
Tell your boss what it's like to
have 20 open case files on your desk.

20:10.273 --> 20:12.873
You know what, Rosetti? I don't
care if you've got a hundred.

20:13.373 --> 20:15.273
There could still be a killer out there.

20:35.773 --> 20:37.673
Well, I hope you weren't looking for me.

20:37.773 --> 20:39.573
Is that really what you are hoping?

20:39.673 --> 20:40.873
Not even close.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.773
You know, I could,
buy you a drink, or...

20:44.073 --> 20:45.073
Or what?

20:45.273 --> 20:46.673
You could come home with me.

20:47.873 --> 20:48.973
Why would I do that?

20:49.273 --> 20:51.473
Because you feel guilty
about lying to me.

20:51.773 --> 20:53.973
Or because you just
killed somebody and...

20:54.273 --> 20:55.473
need someone to hug.

20:55.573 --> 20:59.173
Why do I have the feeling that you
are angling for more than just a hug?

20:59.373 --> 21:00.673
Angling? No.

21:01.573 --> 21:02.573
Hoping?

21:05.373 --> 21:07.673
Have you been telling me the
truth about your girlfriend?

21:07.773 --> 21:10.873
Or are you just taking
advantage of my raw

21:11.073 --> 21:12.373
emotional state?

21:12.673 --> 21:13.673
Yes.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.073
And...

21:15.873 --> 21:16.873
yes.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.973
No, easy. Easy. Just
reaching for my glasses.

21:43.673 --> 21:45.273
You should not do that to me.

21:57.973 --> 21:59.073
Look...

22:00.773 --> 22:02.773
I don't usually
do this kind of thing.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.473
Neither do I.

22:07.773 --> 22:09.473
Is that the gun you shot Hoffman with?

22:10.073 --> 22:11.073
No.

22:13.073 --> 22:14.973
We struggled and then I...

22:15.773 --> 22:16.873
No, it's not the gun.

22:18.373 --> 22:19.373
So,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.573
what's it like to shoot someone?

22:23.573 --> 22:24.773
It is what it is.

22:25.573 --> 22:27.373
It is what you have to do.

22:29.673 --> 22:31.373
These are not things I dwell upon.

22:37.073 --> 22:38.573
I mean, were you scared?

22:40.673 --> 22:41.673
No.

22:42.673 --> 22:44.373
Sorry. That's a...
that's a dumb question.

22:44.473 --> 22:47.373
I guess you wouldn't be an NCIS
agent if you had a problem with it.

22:47.773 --> 22:49.773
I'm not an NCIS agent.

22:51.173 --> 22:52.773
I am Israeli Mossad.

22:57.473 --> 23:00.373
Guessing Hoffman's not
the first guy you've...

23:04.373 --> 23:07.273
Why does everyone think all
Mossad agents are assassins?

23:08.673 --> 23:09.673
Are you?

23:13.273 --> 23:14.273
You know,

23:14.473 --> 23:16.173
I've never handled a gun before.

23:16.973 --> 23:19.073
Well, you're not going
to handle one now.

23:20.773 --> 23:23.973
Well, I guess I'll just have
to handle something else.

23:40.773 --> 23:43.473
I've re-sampled the image as
many times as I can, McGee.

23:43.573 --> 23:45.573
Try removing compression artifacts.

23:46.273 --> 23:47.573
It's too pixelated.

23:48.073 --> 23:49.773
Did you try detecting edges?

23:51.273 --> 23:52.673
I am detecting an edge.

23:52.873 --> 23:55.373
I'm good, McGee, but
I can't work miracles.

23:55.473 --> 23:56.538
This is impossible.

23:56.573 --> 23:58.738
I've told you once, I've
told you a thousand times...

23:58.773 --> 24:01.373
There is no substitute for
quality source imagery. I know.

24:03.073 --> 24:04.373
Where are you going?

24:04.873 --> 24:06.038
I am going back to work.

24:06.073 --> 24:09.173
Well, you think I'm going to give up
that easily? You think I'm a quitter?

24:09.273 --> 24:12.473
You, of all people should know that
I thrive in the face of adversity.

24:19.373 --> 24:21.473
You're making the face of adversity.

24:21.773 --> 24:24.773
I found each of the victim's
blood on the murder weapon.

24:25.373 --> 24:27.373
Hoffman didn't clean the
knife after each murder?

24:27.573 --> 24:29.673
No, he did meticulously.

24:29.973 --> 24:32.973
But I found trace evidence where
the blade goes into the handle.

24:33.273 --> 24:37.073
Okay, look, four of the victims
have blood type O-positive.

24:37.573 --> 24:40.273
- The fifth victim has blood type A.
- Positive.

24:40.308 --> 24:41.438
That's not that strange.

24:41.473 --> 24:43.873
Most killers don't chose
their victims by blood type.

24:43.973 --> 24:45.873
No, no, that's not what's strange.

24:46.173 --> 24:48.373
I also found traces of a B-positive.

24:48.573 --> 24:50.173
Then it must be Hoffman's blood.

24:50.973 --> 24:51.973
No.

24:52.373 --> 24:53.673
He's O-negative.

24:53.873 --> 24:54.873
Not a match.

24:55.173 --> 24:56.873
There's a sixth victim, McGee.

24:58.073 --> 24:59.973
Whose body hasn't been found yet.

25:07.018 --> 25:09.418
Did she leave any
forwarding number or address?

25:09.518 --> 25:11.218
- No, I'm afraid she didn't.
- Okay.

25:11.918 --> 25:13.718
Well, if she makes contact,

25:14.318 --> 25:15.518
will you please notify me?

25:16.218 --> 25:17.918
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:19.418 --> 25:20.483
What are you doing?

25:20.518 --> 25:22.818
Checking into Locke's
missing girlfriend. You?

25:23.318 --> 25:24.318
Same.

25:24.418 --> 25:25.418
What?

25:25.718 --> 25:26.718
Why?

25:27.418 --> 25:29.118
Devon Linden Katz.

25:29.318 --> 25:31.118
Yeah, not like the musical.

25:31.218 --> 25:32.818
Starts with a K, ends with a Z.

25:32.918 --> 25:34.518
- Got it.
- Thanks. All right.

25:35.218 --> 25:36.583
Checking her medical records.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.479
What, you think she's been lying in
some hospital, unable to communicate?

25:39.503 --> 25:42.318
No. I think she's been lying in a
shallow grave, unable to communicate.

25:42.418 --> 25:44.418
Medical records are
privileged information.

25:44.518 --> 25:45.618
You need a subpoena.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.818
Not if you have an IOU.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.918
From a county clerk with a
very expressive poker face. Hey.

25:50.918 --> 25:53.018
There it is. Thanks, Laramie. I owe you.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.118
Well, not as much as
you owe me, of course.

25:55.318 --> 25:56.318
Right.

25:56.718 --> 25:58.718
Guess what Locke's
girlfriend's blood type is?

25:59.018 --> 26:01.418
The same blood type Abby found
on the knife... B-positive.

26:01.618 --> 26:04.318
Although it's hard to be positive
when the news is so negative.

26:04.818 --> 26:06.118
Millions have that blood type.

26:06.218 --> 26:08.818
Only ten percent of Americans
have that blood type.

26:08.853 --> 26:11.383
So you have narrowed it
down to what, millions?

26:11.418 --> 26:14.129
Narrows it down a lot further when
you consider that she was a regular

26:14.153 --> 26:16.818
at the bar frequented
by two other victims.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.218
She could easily be victim number six.

26:19.418 --> 26:22.118
And your pal Locke could be her killer.

26:22.418 --> 26:24.518
- He is not a killer.
- Okay.

26:25.218 --> 26:27.918
Co-killer, assistant
killer, killer's apprentice.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.918
Michael was not involved in the murders.

26:30.218 --> 26:31.218
Michael?

26:32.518 --> 26:33.518
That is his name.

26:34.018 --> 26:35.618
That is his first name.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.118
You didn't.

26:39.818 --> 26:41.018
Don't tell me.

26:44.418 --> 26:46.418
- Okay, tell me.
- What I did

26:46.818 --> 26:49.718
or did not do is none of your business.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.618
Detective Rosetti, morning.

27:07.618 --> 27:10.718
Here are the case
files your boss wanted.

27:14.318 --> 27:15.518
Sorry.

27:19.218 --> 27:20.718
- Hoffman's car.
- Yep.

27:21.018 --> 27:24.118
All 786 square feet of dustable surface.

27:24.618 --> 27:25.818
You find anything?

27:26.018 --> 27:29.918
$3.50 in change. An impressive
gum wrapper collection.

27:31.018 --> 27:32.918
All right. Thanks for
the files, Detective.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.318
You want the rest?

27:35.818 --> 27:37.618
You guys wanted everything.

27:41.218 --> 27:42.418
Here's everything.

27:43.818 --> 27:46.818
You didn't happen to make a digital
catalogue of all the evidence, did you?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.118
Digital catalogue?

27:50.818 --> 27:52.518
- That's a good one.
- Okay.

27:53.118 --> 27:54.118
Four boxes,

27:54.318 --> 27:57.018
four bags of evidence, four
bags of personal effects.

27:57.053 --> 27:58.783
I am going to be here forever.

27:58.818 --> 28:01.018
This one has your name
written all over it.

28:01.318 --> 28:02.318
Thank you.

28:02.618 --> 28:03.818
Got an address book.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.518
That's great.

28:07.718 --> 28:10.718
So far, all of the prints from
the car they match Hoffman.

28:10.918 --> 28:12.818
There's just no sign of an accomplice.

28:12.918 --> 28:14.318
What about the video still?

28:14.418 --> 28:16.118
I have tried everything.

28:16.318 --> 28:18.118
I just... I can't get an ID.

28:18.318 --> 28:19.718
You're admitting defeat?

28:20.018 --> 28:21.018
No.

28:22.318 --> 28:23.918
I have a new tactical plan.

28:27.018 --> 28:29.618
By triangulating the
heights of the landmarks.

28:29.718 --> 28:31.418
Like the street lights
and cars and stuff.

28:31.518 --> 28:34.618
I think I can figure out an
approximate height and weight

28:34.818 --> 28:36.818
of Hoffman's alleged accomplice.

28:36.853 --> 28:37.853
That's great.

28:38.018 --> 28:39.218
There's a page missing.

28:39.918 --> 28:40.918
Torn out.

28:41.218 --> 28:43.618
That's why the pages fell.
Someone tore out the binding.

28:43.818 --> 28:45.918
Why would someone tear out a page?

28:52.018 --> 28:53.518
How tall is your buddy Locke?

28:53.718 --> 28:56.218
About six-one, six-two.

28:56.418 --> 28:57.818
How much do you think he weighs?

28:58.618 --> 28:59.818
Why do you ask?

29:00.118 --> 29:01.218
Why don't you answer?

29:01.318 --> 29:03.018
170, 180.

29:03.218 --> 29:05.283
Abby calculated the
height and the weight

29:05.318 --> 29:09.118
of the mystery man on the surveillance
video. Six-one, 180, just like Locke.

29:09.318 --> 29:12.118
Well, the only thing that
proves is that you are jealous.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.618
I'm concerned.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.318
Slim build, just like Locke.

29:16.318 --> 29:19.718
Of course, with your hands-on experience
last night, maybe you could elaborate.

29:20.118 --> 29:22.018
Saw you two leaving the bar together.

29:23.118 --> 29:25.218
- You followed me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

29:25.418 --> 29:27.618
You do look good on the
surveillance video, though.

29:27.918 --> 29:29.318
Adds about ten pounds.

29:33.018 --> 29:36.218
O/~ Come with me My love...

29:36.718 --> 29:39.118
Address book belonged to Monica
Bishop, victim number three.

29:39.218 --> 29:42.118
Missing page is from the Rs.
Pull up her phone records.

29:42.818 --> 29:46.518
O/~ I want to tell
you. Just how much I...

29:46.618 --> 29:48.918
"Sea of Love", boss.
Remember that movie?

29:49.118 --> 29:52.218
Al Pacino plays a cop, sleeps with a
serial killer played by Ellen Barkin?

29:52.418 --> 29:55.218
But the zany twist here is,
Ziva's Pacino, and Locke is Barkin.

29:55.318 --> 29:57.518
- Might even be biting.
- Shut your trap, DiNozzo!

29:57.618 --> 29:59.218
Am I missing something here?

30:01.518 --> 30:02.918
Boss, I got it.

30:03.018 --> 30:06.718
Matching calls Bishop sent or received
over the past year against the letter R.

30:07.018 --> 30:09.218
Reeves, Rexon, Richards.

30:09.518 --> 30:10.518
Rosetti.

30:10.718 --> 30:14.018
Over a two-week period last year,
Rosetti called Bishop five times.

30:14.053 --> 30:16.218
Rosetti never said boo about
knowing the third victim.

30:16.318 --> 30:18.218
He's covering for
something. Bring him in.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.218
You know the ramifications
of tampering with evidence?

30:22.818 --> 30:25.518
- What are you talking about?
- Belonged to Monica Bishop.

30:26.318 --> 30:27.618
Victim number three.

30:30.718 --> 30:31.718
You forget?

30:33.218 --> 30:35.418
Nobody knows this case
better than me, Gibbs.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.618
Well, I'm guessing

30:38.918 --> 30:41.318
you knew Monica more than a little bit.

30:42.018 --> 30:45.818
That why you tore the page out of
this with your name and address on it?

30:49.118 --> 30:50.618
How did it go down, Chris?

30:51.318 --> 30:54.518
Did you meet Hoffman in the same
bar where you met Monica Bishop?

30:56.818 --> 30:58.318
What was your beef?

30:59.618 --> 31:00.618
Rejection?

31:01.918 --> 31:02.918
Jealousy?

31:04.218 --> 31:05.218
Impotency?

31:07.718 --> 31:09.718
I had an affair with Monica Bishop.

31:09.918 --> 31:10.918
End of story.

31:11.018 --> 31:13.718
Feels more like the middle, actually.

31:16.618 --> 31:18.818
Did you help Hoffman, or you just watch?

31:19.018 --> 31:20.518
Go to hell, Gibbs.

31:22.018 --> 31:23.618
You got the wrong story.

31:23.818 --> 31:24.918
Put me straight.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.118
I met her at that bar six months ago.

31:28.518 --> 31:30.018
She was a fixture there.

31:30.318 --> 31:32.718
You could drag a dozen guys
in here who slept with her.

31:32.918 --> 31:34.218
She had it coming?

31:34.318 --> 31:35.918
It was just an affair.

31:36.018 --> 31:37.018
No big deal.

31:37.318 --> 31:38.918
Yeah? Then why'd you hide it?

31:40.618 --> 31:42.418
She was married, I was married.

31:42.818 --> 31:46.318
You don't tamper with evidence because
your afraid your wife's gonna see it.

31:49.518 --> 31:52.218
If my captain found
out I slept with her,

31:53.518 --> 31:56.018
- he would have taken me off the case.
- Well, he should have.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.018
I wanted to catch this guy.

31:58.118 --> 31:59.618
You were getting laid.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.818
- You wanted to protect your ass.
- No!

32:03.218 --> 32:05.018
I wanted the scumbag dead!

32:05.618 --> 32:07.618
I was investigating
the first two murders

32:07.918 --> 32:10.418
before she turned up
as the third victim.

32:10.918 --> 32:13.118
If you guys hadn't taken over this case,

32:13.318 --> 32:16.418
I would have caught Hoffman,
and I would have popped him.

32:16.618 --> 32:17.618
Gladly.

32:29.318 --> 32:31.418
Gibbs doesn't think
Rosetti's the killer.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.518
Neither do I.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.718
Guess that just leaves your boyfriend.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.718
You got to stop staring
at this one, Ziva.

33:46.318 --> 33:47.718
Put it behind you.

33:57.018 --> 33:59.118
- You seeing Locke?
- You have a problem with that?

33:59.153 --> 34:00.518
I do if he's a suspect.

34:00.618 --> 34:02.318
- Is he?
- You tell me.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.217
Look, if you're going to give
me a lecture on my bad judgment,

34:08.253 --> 34:09.818
I don't need to hear it.

34:10.018 --> 34:11.518
Is that what this is about?

34:11.618 --> 34:13.518
You doubting your judgment?

34:13.618 --> 34:15.217
I should've moved earlier.

34:15.318 --> 34:16.918
You would've if you could've.

34:17.418 --> 34:19.918
- I left it too late.
- You still took him out.

34:22.318 --> 34:23.618
I almost died.

34:24.618 --> 34:25.918
But you didn't.

34:28.118 --> 34:30.418
You've got to trust your judgment, Ziva.

34:32.318 --> 34:33.818
Moment you don't...

34:35.918 --> 34:37.618
it won't be "almost".

34:51.463 --> 34:52.663
Devon, it's me.

34:52.862 --> 34:54.463
Did you tell Michael about us yet?

34:54.663 --> 34:57.663
'Cause if you meant what you said
last night, it's over between you two.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.263
You've got to tell him about us.

34:59.463 --> 35:00.963
'Cause if you don't, I will.

35:01.063 --> 35:02.663
- Who is he?
- Don't know yet.

35:02.763 --> 35:04.863
It's a deleted message
from Devon Katz's phone.

35:05.263 --> 35:07.063
Locke's missing girlfriend.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.063
Mystery voice was obviously
begging her to dump Locke.

35:10.463 --> 35:12.963
- How did we get the recording?
- Tell him, McSneaky.

35:13.063 --> 35:14.763
Accessed the phone provider's mainframe.

35:14.863 --> 35:15.928
What we got on him?

35:15.963 --> 35:18.774
He's been hanging out at the bar where
two of the victims were last seen.

35:18.798 --> 35:21.263
We can tie him to Hoffman.
Bartender says they were friendly.

35:21.363 --> 35:23.963
Locke reported Devon Katz
missing two weeks ago.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.163
- Covering his tracks.
- No trace of her.

35:26.363 --> 35:28.028
Her blood type was B-positive.

35:28.063 --> 35:30.663
Same as the blood type
Abby found on the knife.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.028
Victim six?

35:32.063 --> 35:34.163
My guess is Locke found
out she was bouncy-bouncy

35:34.263 --> 35:36.863
- with some other guy and he killed her.
- You're wrong.

35:37.563 --> 35:39.363
You've got to look at
this objectively, Ziva.

35:39.463 --> 35:40.863
Evidence says he's guilty.

35:40.963 --> 35:42.263
All circumcised.

35:42.363 --> 35:43.663
Circumstantial.

35:43.763 --> 35:45.963
I think she knows what
she's talking about.

35:51.263 --> 35:52.763
His print is on the barrel.

35:53.863 --> 35:56.363
- What are you doing?
- Trusting my judgment.

36:00.663 --> 36:03.763
Come on, you big band of belted butyl.

36:10.863 --> 36:11.863
Good.

36:12.063 --> 36:13.563
I could use some help here.

36:14.863 --> 36:16.363
Not tired of those things yet?

36:18.863 --> 36:20.363
Hold this, carefully.

36:20.563 --> 36:21.963
Locke's fingerprint's on it.

36:22.063 --> 36:23.163
Roll aside.

36:24.563 --> 36:25.863
Man's work.

36:30.363 --> 36:31.363
Heavy.

36:38.463 --> 36:39.463
Thank you.

36:43.463 --> 36:44.763
Oh my...

36:45.063 --> 36:46.063
What?

36:57.663 --> 36:59.563
You brought me here for a reason.

37:01.963 --> 37:03.363
I need some answers.

37:04.863 --> 37:07.163
I thought you said you
wanted to put this behind you.

37:20.463 --> 37:22.763
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just a few minutes.

37:22.863 --> 37:24.563
You match the fingers
to the victims yet?

37:24.598 --> 37:26.163
I'm working on it, Gibbs.

37:27.263 --> 37:28.563
Did you call Ziva?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.163
Not answering, boss.

37:30.363 --> 37:32.463
Okay. So this one...

37:32.763 --> 37:34.463
No-brainer, easy to match.

37:34.563 --> 37:37.363
I've always really liked this
color. It's called Arctic Blue.

37:37.763 --> 37:38.863
And the rest?

37:39.363 --> 37:41.063
Well, I'll give you a hand, Abby.

37:41.263 --> 37:42.663
It shouldn't take us long.

37:43.663 --> 37:45.063
So what went wrong?

37:45.863 --> 37:47.163
Waited too long.

37:48.263 --> 37:49.963
I should have moved faster.

37:53.863 --> 37:55.363
Right about here...

37:58.963 --> 38:00.463
There was nowhere left to go.

38:04.863 --> 38:06.563
And we fell onto the floor.

38:07.863 --> 38:10.963
We struggled, and then I pushed him off.

38:11.763 --> 38:13.563
Jethro, based on blood type,

38:13.663 --> 38:16.663
skin tone, angle of
cut, I am 95% certain

38:16.763 --> 38:20.063
that these belong to victims
one, two, three and five.

38:20.263 --> 38:22.663
As you recall, victim
number four's finger,

38:22.863 --> 38:26.563
unlike the others, was severed
immediately after death.

38:26.663 --> 38:28.663
Copycat theory sounding
pretty good, boss.

38:28.763 --> 38:30.874
Whoever killed number four
knew to cut off the finger,

38:30.898 --> 38:32.974
but didn't know Hoffman was
keeping them as souvenirs.

38:32.998 --> 38:34.663
Or where he stashed them.

38:36.363 --> 38:37.463
I crawled.

38:43.763 --> 38:45.163
I grabbed the gun.

38:46.263 --> 38:47.863
I rolled over...

38:53.463 --> 38:54.963
and there he was.

38:55.263 --> 38:56.363
And you shot him.

39:03.763 --> 39:04.863
I shot him.

39:05.863 --> 39:07.163
I don't understand.

39:07.863 --> 39:10.363
- Why didn't you shoot him earlier?
- I was undercover.

39:11.863 --> 39:13.363
I didn't have my gun.

39:15.563 --> 39:16.763
Just like now.

39:20.763 --> 39:22.063
Locke was all whorls.

39:22.163 --> 39:23.863
Bad guy, loops and arches.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.663
Locke is not the killer.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.463
You owe Ziva an apology.

39:27.963 --> 39:31.763
Yes, but we still have to account
for victim number four's finger,

39:31.863 --> 39:33.563
cut off right after death.

39:33.763 --> 39:35.463
Patricia Massey, military wife.

39:35.763 --> 39:38.663
Copycat hides her murder
among Hoffman's victims.

39:38.763 --> 39:39.763
Husband?

39:40.163 --> 39:41.563
Always suspect the spouse.

39:42.063 --> 39:44.363
Speaking from personal
experience, Jethro?

39:44.563 --> 39:46.863
That's why I'm never getting married.

39:47.063 --> 39:49.063
Petty Officer Massey's build does match

39:49.163 --> 39:51.463
the guy following Hoffman
on the surveillance video.

39:52.063 --> 39:53.163
Call her.

39:56.663 --> 39:57.763
Abs.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.863
- Yes, Gibbs?
- Lose the wheels.

40:05.963 --> 40:08.763
- What do you want, Tony?
- Locke print doesn't match the partial.

40:09.563 --> 40:11.363
- His print is not a match?
- Right.

40:11.563 --> 40:13.763
Well, next time we should
both listen to my instincts.

40:13.863 --> 40:14.863
Yeah.

40:18.263 --> 40:19.563
Was that about me?

40:21.463 --> 40:24.263
Was this about me, still a suspect?

40:26.463 --> 40:27.663
I never believed it.

40:27.963 --> 40:29.163
How'd you get my print?

40:29.463 --> 40:30.763
You touched my gun.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.263
So you took my fingerprint, ran it.

40:34.563 --> 40:38.063
I didn't match up, and now you're
telling me you never believed it was me?

40:38.563 --> 40:39.563
Look...

40:40.363 --> 40:42.163
I tried to stop this, okay?

40:44.163 --> 40:45.463
I'm sorry, Michael.

40:45.863 --> 40:47.563
I wish I could believe you,

40:47.763 --> 40:49.463
Ziva, Gina...

40:50.463 --> 40:51.463
whatever.

41:11.063 --> 41:12.028
Hey, something wrong?

41:12.063 --> 41:14.103
Yeah. Like to talk to you.
Need you to come with us.

41:14.363 --> 41:16.463
Yeah, we're a man short
today. Can it wait?

41:16.563 --> 41:17.963
- No.
- What's the problem?

41:18.063 --> 41:19.963
Got some theories on your wife's murder.

41:20.063 --> 41:21.563
Yeah, you got the guy, he's dead.

41:21.763 --> 41:23.763
We don't think Andy Hoffman killed her.

41:25.063 --> 41:26.963
Sure you want to do this here, Massey?

41:27.263 --> 41:28.363
I got nothing to hide.

41:29.363 --> 41:32.163
Hoffman was killing women who
were cheating on their husbands.

41:32.363 --> 41:33.928
You saying my wife was cheating on me?

41:33.963 --> 41:36.163
Probably why you were
drinking at your favorite bar.

41:36.463 --> 41:37.963
Same bar Hoffman frequented.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.163
Same bar where he picked
up two of his victims.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.263
You noticed him,

41:41.363 --> 41:43.774
heard about the killings in the
news. Put two and two together.

41:43.798 --> 41:46.163
The night Hoffman picked up
his third victim at the bar,

41:46.198 --> 41:47.663
you watched them leave.

41:47.698 --> 41:48.763
Not me.

41:48.863 --> 41:50.763
You followed them back
to Hoffman's house.

41:50.798 --> 41:52.663
When he left and she
didn't, you broke in.

41:52.963 --> 41:53.963
It's pretty neat.

41:54.063 --> 41:57.563
Copycat killing using the same
knife and MO as the original killer.

41:58.263 --> 41:59.963
You guys got a wild imagination.

42:00.263 --> 42:02.623
Yeah, well, the mistake you
made, the thing you didn't know,

42:02.763 --> 42:05.663
is that Hoffman kept the
fingers, except your wife's.

42:06.163 --> 42:07.363
Well, that looks deep.

42:07.963 --> 42:09.463
Working on the engine.

42:09.663 --> 42:12.663
No. I think it's from cutting
off your wife's finger.

42:13.363 --> 42:15.963
We found a partial print and
traces of blood on the murder weapon

42:15.998 --> 42:17.763
that don't match Hoffman or the victims.

42:18.263 --> 42:20.363
DNA's going to narrow it down to you.

42:43.263 --> 42:44.263
Hi.

42:44.963 --> 42:46.163
What do you want?

42:49.263 --> 42:50.463
Telephone number.

42:50.863 --> 42:51.863
I found Devon.

42:55.763 --> 42:57.463
I thought I owed you that much.

42:58.863 --> 43:00.663
She wants to talk to you.

43:04.263 --> 43:05.263
Ziva.

43:08.963 --> 43:09.963
Thanks.
