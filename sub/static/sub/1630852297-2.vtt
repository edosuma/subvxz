(AUDIENCE WHOOPS, CHEERS)

00:42.240 --> 00:44.280
- WOMAN: He's ready to see you now.
- Thank you.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.760
MAN: Thanks for coming in today.
Really appreciate you sending in your CV.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.160
- No problem.
- It was funny.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.320
- Oh? OK. That wasn't my intention but...
- Great.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.960
Our current situation is unusual

00:57.080 --> 01:00.560
in that we don't have many...
any women working here.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.160
- Mainly due to the...
- The sexual harassment case.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.840
- ..sexual harassment case, yes.
- Yes, yes.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.600
- Are you all right?
- Yes sorry.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.200
I just ran from the station. Sorry.
I'm a bit hot. I'm really excited...

01:10.320 --> 01:12.760
- Water?
- No, no. I don't...

01:14.400 --> 01:16.440
- Actually, water would be great....
- We're looking for someone

01:16.560 --> 01:18.600
who can handle themselves
in a competitive environment.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.880
It will mainly be filing,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.440
but we have some pretty good
filers here, so... (HE CHUCKLES)

01:22.560 --> 01:24.960
(FORCED LAUGH)

01:26.360 --> 01:27.360
Yeah.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.120
It also involves updating the website
and throwing up an occasional twit.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.720
It says here that you've done something
similar at the café that you used to...

01:34.840 --> 01:36.320
Ah, OK.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.160
I'm sorry. That won't get you
very far here any more.

01:44.680 --> 01:48.640
Oh no, sorry,
I thought I had a top on underneath.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.200
Yeah. OK. But for the record...

01:52.320 --> 01:54.479
Seriously.
In this case, genuine accident.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.720
With our history here, I understand
why you might have thought...

01:56.840 --> 01:59.200
No, I wasn't trying to...
Jesus, I was hot!

01:59.320 --> 02:01.240
I take this kind of thing
very seriously now.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.840
I'm not trying to shag you!
Look at yourself.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.360
(SHE LAUGHS)

02:10.520 --> 02:12.520
OK. Please leave.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.920
What?

02:18.400 --> 02:21.000
- But you don't understand. I need this...
- Please just leave.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.120
- Perv!
- Slut!

02:31.240 --> 02:32.720
Wow!

02:32.840 --> 02:35.640
- Please leave.
- You please leave.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.160
- It's my office.
- Yeah?

02:43.360 --> 02:44.760
OK.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.800
(FOOTSTEPS WALKING AWAY)

02:47.840 --> 02:48.920
Wait!

03:03.760 --> 03:08.920
Three nights ago,
I ordered myself a very slutty pizza.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.400
I mean, the bitch was dripping!

03:14.720 --> 03:17.200
That dirty little stuffed crust
wanted to be in me so bad

03:17.320 --> 03:20.880
I just ate the little tart like she meant
nothing to me, and she loved it.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.840
That pretty much nailed that,
and it was pretty late now

03:24.960 --> 03:28.200
so I dragged myself upstairs
to get into my office, or my bed,

03:28.320 --> 03:30.920
and tried to work
on the figures for the café.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.280
I run a guinea-pig themed café,
but it's out of cash

03:34.400 --> 03:36.400
and it's going to close
unless a cheque falls out of the sky

03:36.520 --> 03:39.280
or a banker comes on my arse,
but neither are going to happen.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.320
And I don't want to dignify
the banker man with a proper mention

03:42.440 --> 03:44.680
so I'm not going to talk about him.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.440
Or how I do sometimes wish
I could own up to not having morals

03:47.560 --> 03:51.200
and let him come on my arse
for £10,000.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.760
But apparently,
we're not supposed to do that.

03:55.800 --> 04:01.080
So, OK, I won't.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.840
Even though it would solve everything,
I won't.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.600
Even though I could.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.680
Lying in my office, the café numbers start
to jump out at me like little ninjas.

04:12.800 --> 04:17.040
So, I rationalise it would be good
to switch off for a bit, improve my mind.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.880
So I watched a pretty good movie,
actually, called 17 Again.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.040
With Zac Efron, who is... He's fit!

04:27.240 --> 04:31.080
I know. But seriously,
he's actually a really good actor.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.680
The film could have been worse.
Honestly, check it out.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.920
So when that finished,
I lay there, thinking ―

04:39.040 --> 04:43.000
Café. Numbers.
Numbers. Zack. Numbers.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.560
Googled Obama
to keep up with... you know.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.120
― OBAMA: I am so happy to be here.
― Who, as it turns out, is also...

04:50.240 --> 04:53.000
― It is wonderful to see all those...
― ..attractive.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.880
Lay there thinking.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.240
Café, numbers, numbers, Obama,

04:58.360 --> 05:00.360
numbers, Zack,
Obama, numbers, Zack.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.000
Suddenly I was on YouPorn
having a horrible wank.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.600
I found just the right sort of gangbang,

05:10.200 --> 05:13.200
Now that really knocked me out,
so I put my computer away,

05:13.320 --> 05:16.080
leaned over, kissed my boyfriend Harry
good night and went to sleep.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.120
The next morning,
I wake to find a note from Harry

05:24.240 --> 05:26.600
which reads, 'That was the last straw.'

05:28.440 --> 05:30.000
Bit out of the blue, to be honest.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.720
Didn't know he was counting straws,
but nice to know he was paying attention.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.840
All of his stuff was gone.

05:36.960 --> 05:41.040
And everything in the fridge.
I was a bit thrilled by his selfishness.

05:41.159 --> 05:45.640
Suddenly fancied him again. But I was
relieved that one of us did something.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.200
He used to say things to me like,
'You're not like other girls.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.880
'You can keep up.'

05:55.840 --> 05:58.640
Keep up?

06:01.680 --> 06:04.080
I stood staring
at a hand-print on my wall

06:04.200 --> 06:06.360
from when I had a threesome
on my period.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.200
Harry and I break up every
12-18 months and when we do, well...

06:20.960 --> 06:24.120
I wish I could tell you my threesome
story was awkward and sticky

06:24.240 --> 06:26.640
and everyone went home
a little bit sad and empty,

06:26.760 --> 06:28.320
but it was lovely.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.920
Sorry.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.240
I do admire how much Harry
commits to our breakups.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.520
The fridge was a new detail,
but he does always go the extra mile.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.840
A few times
he's even cleaned the whole flat.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.200
Like it's a crime scene.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.640
I've often considered
timing our breakups

06:48.760 --> 06:51.000
when the flat needs
a bit of a going over.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.480
I never know
what's going to set him off.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.600
Keeps me on my toes.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.480
I sit on the loo

06:58.600 --> 07:01.120
and think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.560
I'm not obsessed with sex.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.920
I just can't stop thinking about it.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.560
The performance of it.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.480
The awkwardness of it.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.080
The drama of it.

07:17.120 --> 07:23.960
The moment you realise
someone wants your body.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.920
Not so much the feeling of it.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.640
I reckon I've got about a week
before Harry gets back.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.400
So, I'd better get on it.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.920
Into the shower. Boom. Bedroom. Makeup.
Boom. Gonna really make an effort.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.880
I take half an hour trying to look nice
and I end up looking amazing.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.040
It's the best in ages.
One of those days. Boom!

07:48.159 --> 07:52.320
Gorgeous, fresh faced, heels,
wearing a skirt, new top, little bit sexy,

07:52.440 --> 07:55.080
on my way to save my café
and yes, I am strutting.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.240
I can see a man coming
towards me from the bus stop.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.000
He just cannot take his eyes off me.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.520
And I'm walking like I've got
a paintbrush up my arse, thinking,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.920
'Yeah, you check me out, 'cos it's never
going to happen, Chub-Chub.'

08:09.560 --> 08:11.960
I opened the café with my friend, Boo.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.480
She's dead now.
She accidentally killed herself.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.240
It wasn't her intention,
but it wasn't a total accident.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.040
She didn't think she'd actually die.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.120
She just found out that
her boyfriend fucked someone else

08:21.240 --> 08:22.920
and wanted to punish him
by ending up in hospital

08:23.040 --> 08:24.760
and not letting him visit her for a bit.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.360
She decided to walk
into a busy cycle lane

08:27.480 --> 08:30.000
wanting to get tangled in a bike,
break a finger, maybe.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.600
But it turns out, bikes go fast
and flip you into the road.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.080
Three people died.
She was such a dick.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I never told her parents the truth.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.120
I told her boyfriend.

08:43.559 --> 08:44.840
He cried.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.040
A lot.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.520
(FOOTSTEPS)

08:50.640 --> 08:52.440
Chub-Chub's getting closer.

08:52.560 --> 08:57.040
Oversized jacket. Meaty face.
Looks me up and down.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.360
It's like he's confused
about how attractive I am.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
Like he can't quite believe it.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.040
I worry for a second I'm going to make
a sex offender out of the poor guy.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.080
Oh, he's going to say something.
Here we fucking go.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.760
This better be good.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.840
He's passing, he's passing.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.040
He brings his hand to his mouth
and he coughs.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.920
'Walk of shame!'

09:25.640 --> 09:27.960
Too late for me to go home
and change.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.160
I have flat shoes in my bag,
and anyway he was fat.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.680
And he can't take that off at night.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.680
Harry's a bit fat.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.920
He lightly pats his belly
like he's a little bear,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.400
proud of what he's achieved ―

09:47.520 --> 09:50.280
hunted, gathered, eaten.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.560
Pat.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.520
Evidence. Pat, pat. It makes me laugh.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.360
A pretty girl at a party once asked me

10:00.480 --> 10:02.960
if I secretly liked
that Harry had a little paunch

10:03.080 --> 10:06.240
because it made him
less attractive to other women.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.280
Her boyfriend was the whale in the corner,
blocking the doors to the toilets!

10:12.080 --> 10:16.120
I asked her if he made her
wash the bits he can't reach.

10:17.320 --> 10:21.680
She slapped me. Actual slap.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.800
Which means he did.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.280
Boo's death hit the papers.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.240
'Local café girl gets hit by bike
and a car and another bike.'

10:34.880 --> 10:36.920
There was a buzz
around the café all of a sudden.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.000
Notes, flowers, guinea pig memorabilia
were left in her memory.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.000
Boo made sense of the guinea pig theme.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.400
She was all small and cute and put
pictures of guinea pigs everywhere.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.520
I pretend they're not there.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.120
Which I suspect makes the whole
guinea pig café experience a bit creepy.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.760
Boo was built a bit like a guinea-pig.

10:56.320 --> 11:00.000
No waist or hips. Just straight down.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.080
But she rocked it.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.480
And she was beautiful.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.360
Tricky, though.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.360
Jealous. Sensitive.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.320
But beautiful.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.440
And my best friend.

11:22.720 --> 11:28.720
Ten past 11 at the café.
Quiet. Eerily so.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.400
Boo always used to play music,
read out horoscopes

11:32.520 --> 11:34.920
and shrivel crisp packets
in the microwave.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.000
It used to make the place stink,

11:37.120 --> 11:38.760
but she'd turn the little packets
into key-rings

11:38.880 --> 11:41.480
and give them to the people
who were especially polite.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.760
One guy in the corner drinking tap water
and using the plug.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.400
He should buy something,
but it's just nice to have someone around.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.960
He's reading.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.920
He's quite attractive, actually,
but he doesn't look at me.

11:59.040 --> 12:03.520
Even when I purposely drop a cucumber
just so I have something to bend over for!

12:04.760 --> 12:08.880
Even Joe hasn't turned up.
Joe is always here at 11.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.080
Proper old geezer,
cockney from the toes up,

12:11.200 --> 12:13.040
one of life's good people.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.880
Huge teeth, white hair, ludicrous grin

12:17.000 --> 12:20.280
and a joy that slaps you in the face
until you can't help but smile at it.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.840
Even the fucking furniture loves Joe.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.360
I swear the door swings open voluntarily
when he arrives,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.600
if only to give the man an entrance.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.960
Suddenly he'll just be there.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.720
Crash!
(SHOP BELL RINGS)

12:31.840 --> 12:34.680
It almost clatters off its hinges
with the force of him.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.720
Nothing touches Joe.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.640
He's invincible.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.160
You can hear him bellowing
'Allo sweetpea!'

12:45.280 --> 12:48.040
to the whole street
before he swaggers in.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.920
Long white hair blowing behind him,

12:50.040 --> 12:52.160
cut-off chequered trousers,
white T-shirt, braces.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.160
Dripping wet from the rain.
All 'All right, magic?'

12:55.280 --> 12:58.640
'What a beautiful morning! I can't get
over how glorious it is out there!'

13:00.080 --> 13:03.560
'Lucky to live, eh? Lucky to live.'

13:05.360 --> 13:10.960
I don't know what he does. I just know
he comes in at eleven. Usually.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.040
I find myself watching the door.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.720
I never really noticed he was such
a regular when Boo was here, but now...

13:21.320 --> 13:24.560
But then it's OK, cos I see his silhouette
take up the window

13:24.680 --> 13:26.600
and wait for the door to crash open.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.080
But today it just flops to its side
with a whimper.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.240
And Joe limply shuffles to the counter.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.960
I'm not prepared for this.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.920
All right, Joe?

13:39.560 --> 13:43.520
(FLAT) 'Er, yeah, yeah, ducky.
Yeah, yeah. I'm all right.'

13:45.840 --> 13:47.240
Tea, Joe?

13:48.480 --> 13:50.880
'Er, yeah, darling, that'd be lovely.
Thank you.'

13:51.000 --> 13:53.880
'I'll just... I'll just be out the back.'

13:55.960 --> 13:58.520
I make his tea. Six sugars.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.160
I take it outside,
place it on his little table.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.800
He rolls a fag
and watches the cup steam.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.280
'Now, ain't that a beautiful thing?'

14:13.000 --> 14:14.760
I'm not sure what to...

14:15.760 --> 14:19.520
I ask him for a rollie. I don't smoke.
Well, I do, but... Oh, shut up!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.160
Can I have a rollie, Joe?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.400
'Sugarplum, you can have anything
you want. May I have the honour?'

14:28.520 --> 14:29.880
Yeah, thanks

14:30.000 --> 14:32.720
He rolls it for me with his spindly,
inky fingers.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.720
Takes four seconds. Proper pro.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.120
I take it from him. Light it.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.360
We smoke. I sit beside him.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.200
Two of us on these
tiny little kids' chairs.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.880
Sort of a gimmick thing,
but really they were cheaper.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.400
He looks ridiculous.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.880
'I love these chairs, y'know?'

14:58.360 --> 15:00.320
What's wrong, Joe?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.520
'Ah, my girl, my girl.'

15:08.160 --> 15:11.320
'I love people. I love people.'

15:13.040 --> 15:14.920
'But they get me down.'

15:17.160 --> 15:20.320
Yeah. Yeah, people are shit.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.600
He turns to me, I can see into
every deep line of his face.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.800
'Oh no, darlin', no.
People are amazing!'

15:33.200 --> 15:38.680
'But when will people realise,
that people are all we got?'

15:41.680 --> 15:43.960
He smiles at me,
but I feel a bit ambushed.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.800
So I pretend I have to wash
the cappuccino machine,

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
just go inside
and wipe the nozzle a bit.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.360
Five o'clock. Northern line.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.480
I'm trying to read an article
about how the word 'feminist'

15:55.600 --> 15:57.040
has apparently become dirty.

15:57.960 --> 16:02.160
I try to engage, but all it makes me think
of is a bunch of dirty little feminists.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.080
I snort-laugh at myself

16:10.200 --> 16:14.240
and then catch the eye
of an attractive looking man!

16:15.040 --> 16:16.240
Oh!

16:17.080 --> 16:20.200
Well, he is attractive
when holding his paper to about here.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.120
It all gets a little rodenty
from the nose down,

16:23.240 --> 16:25.720
but it's good enough
for some eye-fucking on the tube.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.720
He smiles at me with his tiny mouth.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.280
I smile back.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.160
He looks down. I look down.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.080
And then we both look up
at the same time.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.360
Little giggle.

16:54.480 --> 17:01.520
Other people in the carriage
start to notice, charmed by the moment.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.880
It's revolting.

17:06.400 --> 17:12.119
The tube pulls in to Tottenham Court Road
and we both stand up at the same time.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.599
I could vomit!

17:15.359 --> 17:20.520
He says to me, 'Um, well, this doesn't
happen very often, does it?'

17:24.920 --> 17:31.560
I give a horribly giggly,
'No, no, it suppose it is quite rare.'

17:34.040 --> 17:37.280
He says it might sound a bit crazy,
but he's got this crazy idea,

17:37.400 --> 17:40.200
and the crazy idea is to take my number.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.680
We give credit to the moment
and exchange numbers.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.640
I leave the Tube
and suddenly have a Harry panic.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.920
He just won't be there any more.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.080
Madam Ovary is telling me
to run back to safe place.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.080
You can make baby in safe place.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.160
I've got to ride it out. The fridge
means nothing. He'll text me later.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.880
Ride it out. I met a nice rodent on
the Tube. I have a lot to be thankful for.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.920
WOMAN: Welcome to Women Speak.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.000
The lecture will commence
in five minutes.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.480
Please have your tickets ready.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.000
I find my sister outside the lecture hall.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.040
She's uptight and beautiful
and probably anorexic,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.920
but clothes look awesome on her, so...

18:16.880 --> 18:21.400
Mum died two years ago. She had a double
mastectomy, but never really recovered.

18:21.520 --> 18:25.240
It was particularly hard
cos she had amazing boobs.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.000
She used to tell me that I was lucky
cos mine will never get in the way.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.680
When I asked her what she meant
she used to demonstrate

18:33.800 --> 18:36.760
by pretend struggling
to open a fridge door.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.960
'And then you can't.'

18:40.680 --> 18:42.600
'Have to sort of go in the side.'

18:44.000 --> 18:45.480
'Agh!'

18:48.760 --> 18:51.760
Or pretending to not be able
to see what's on the floor.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.840
'Fucking nightmare, darling.
Can't see a thing.'

18:54.960 --> 18:57.760
'I've no idea what's there.'

18:59.320 --> 19:02.520
'Is there something there?
You're very lucky.'

19:05.600 --> 19:10.840
My sister's got whoppers.
But she got all of Mum's good bits.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.480
Dad's way of coping
with two motherless daughters

19:14.600 --> 19:16.280
was to buy us tickets
to feminist lectures,

19:16.400 --> 19:18.880
start fucking our godmother
and eventually stop calling.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.640
These lectures are every three months.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.120
It's virtually the only time
I see my sister.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.120
She looks tired.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.000
We sit in the waiting room.

19:34.200 --> 19:39.280
I realise I'm wearing the top
that she 'lost' years ago.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.720
So... Yeah, this is going to be tense.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
She really fucking loved this top.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.160
Her eyes fix on it.

19:51.840 --> 19:58.680
But, and I can see her brain ticking,
she decides to bank it for later.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.000
Makes me nervous. Ammo.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.560
She's reading her Kindle.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.520
She's done her hair a bit fancy.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.360
I wonder if she's going out
after the lecture

20:17.480 --> 20:19.440
or if she's just got her period.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.760
She always does something
a bit different around her period.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.960
She gets really bad PMT.

20:24.080 --> 20:30.040
Mum used to call it her
'monthly confidence crisis', but it's PMT.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.640
The only way she can get through it
is to reinvent herself in some small way.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.440
One particularly bad month,
she came into the kitchen,

20:37.560 --> 20:40.720
on the brink of tears, in full Lycra.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.480
Even Dad had to leave the room.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.800
Looked like she'd climbed into a condom.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.720
That was an emotionally complex
couple of days

20:52.840 --> 20:54.720
that we are not allowed
to talk about any more.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.040
She's sitting so still.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.560
She's definitely having
a monthly confidence crisis.

21:04.920 --> 21:09.000
I mean it's in plaits, both sides,
sort of tied to the top. It's unbearable.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.120
I can't resist

21:50.640 --> 21:53.040
Hair looks nice.
'Fuck off!'

21:56.040 --> 21:57.600
Brilliant!

21:58.360 --> 22:00.760
She asks me about work
and I get all spiky.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.800
I tell her the café lease is up
in a couple of days

22:02.920 --> 22:05.680
unless I can find at least five grand,
which is impossible.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.360
So, I'm having to deal with letting go
of the only thing I have left of Boo,

22:08.480 --> 22:11.320
the only thing that's stopping me from
becoming a corporate lady slave like her,

22:11.440 --> 22:12.880
and I know that everyone thought
I was going to fuck it up

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
and now it looks like I've surpassed
everyone's expectations.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.520
Which I didn't mean to say,
it just falls out,

22:17.640 --> 22:19.760
and now I'm gonna get her smugness
all up in my face.

22:21.120 --> 22:26.320
But she just looks at me. No reaction.
I know the rules.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.280
so I ask her about her super
high-powered, perfect job-work-super-life.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.040
She tells me she's finally been offered
the wet-dream of a job in Finland,

22:34.160 --> 22:35.920
where they want to over-pay
and under-work her

22:36.040 --> 22:38.360
and she doesn't have to wear
power suits any more.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.080
Wow. Finland?

22:41.200 --> 22:42.720
But she's turning it down,

22:42.840 --> 22:45.280
because her husband says
she shouldn't go because of Jake.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.920
Jake's her step-son. He's really weird.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.800
Probably clinically,
but no-one really talks about that.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.680
He freaks out
if she's gone for longer than a day.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.640
And he's got this thing about trying
to get into the bath with her.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.360
He's 15!

23:00.280 --> 23:02.360
I tell her, he's not your son.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.120
'That's not the point.'

23:09.440 --> 23:12.200
'Don't make a face.'
I didn't make a face.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.920
Go! This is about you.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.120
I knew you'd say that.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.400
I tell her she's making
a terrible mistake.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.720
She shouldn't let other people
get in the way of what she really wants,

23:25.840 --> 23:28.320
and Finland's what she really wants.

23:28.440 --> 23:34.800
She tells me that her husband
'isn't other people'.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.600
Her husband is her life.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.160
So, I tell her that her husband
tried to touch me up at Christmas.

23:49.240 --> 23:54.440
I don't know why I said it.
It's true, but he was drunk, so...

23:55.360 --> 23:57.200
Martin's always drunk.

23:57.320 --> 24:01.600
But it's odd, because she's so straight.
Maybe that's not odd.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.240
But he's very good at being drunk,
in that he's fun drunk!

24:06.360 --> 24:07.880
No one wants to admit
there's a problem

24:08.000 --> 24:10.040
because then they don't get to have
crazy nights out

24:10.160 --> 24:12.240
with fun drunk Martin any more.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.640
Martin.

24:21.800 --> 24:28.560
He's one of those men who is explosively
sexually inappropriate with everyone.

24:28.680 --> 24:32.400
Who makes you feel bad if you take offence
because he was just being fun.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.920
Honestly, you can tell him you're going
to pop to the loo and he'll say,

24:36.040 --> 24:37.880
'Ay, ay, you pop to the loo,

24:38.000 --> 24:42.320
'pull your little knickers down
and I'll come in and FUCK YOU!'

24:48.200 --> 24:50.120
Claire always tries to sort of...

24:55.880 --> 25:01.280
..half laugh like she gets the joke,
which isn't even a joke.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.840
Welcome to Women Speak.
Sorry for the delay.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.560
The lecture will begin shortly.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.440
There is no food or drink
permitted in the auditorium.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.880
She just stares at me.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.280
Then her neck goes red.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.240
I've only seen that happen once before.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.400
Then she looks ahead of her.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.880
I give her half my sandwich.
Which she eats.

25:28.320 --> 25:32.240
Maybe she's not anorexic.
Maybe clothes just...

25:34.560 --> 25:35.680
Bitch!

25:37.720 --> 25:40.760
We sit and wait, eating the sandwich.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.520
I can't read her.
I've never been able to read her.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.880
She pulls out a card from Dad
and puts it on the seat between us.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.680
It's probably still there.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.880
Women's Speak is about to commence.
Please enter the auditorium.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.080
The lecture hall is huge.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.440
We go right to the front and sit down.
I still can't read her.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.200
Suddenly she says...

26:05.720 --> 26:07.680
'I'm going to go to fucking Finland.'

26:09.880 --> 26:11.080
OK.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.960
'I hate these suits.'

26:17.520 --> 26:18.720
OK.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.480
'How much do you need to save Boo's café?'

26:25.400 --> 26:27.280
About five grand.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.200
'OK. I'll transfer the money tomorrow.'

26:34.520 --> 26:36.760
'But I don't want to come to these
any more.'

26:39.760 --> 26:40.960
OK.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.880
'And I want my top back'

26:50.720 --> 26:52.000
OK.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.600
- Thanks, Claire
- (FEEDBACK ON MIC)

26:58.120 --> 27:03.560
Thank you. Gosh, look at you all!
Thank you so much for coming.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.080
I am overwhelmed by how many
faces I see before me.

27:07.800 --> 27:12.240
I hope I do your efforts justice
with what I have to say this evening.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.400
But before I begin,
I want to ask you a question ―

27:16.520 --> 27:20.280
the same question
that inspired me to give this lecture.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.440
The same question that was posed
to women all around this country

27:24.560 --> 27:28.440
― with, frankly, shocking results.
― (MOUTHS)

27:28.560 --> 27:33.000
Now, I don't know about you,
but I need some reassurance.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.600
(SPEAKER CHUCKLES)

27:35.720 --> 27:39.480
So, I pose the same question
to the women in this room today.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.440
Please raise your hands

27:42.560 --> 27:51.280
if you would trade five years of your
life for the so-called 'perfect body'.

28:04.440 --> 28:09.120
400 women stare at us horrified.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.240
We are bad feminists.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.840
After the lecture, Claire says
she's going home to talk to Martin.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.560
I want to ask her to have a drink with me
before she goes, but...

28:28.680 --> 28:30.400
I don't know how, so...

28:31.280 --> 28:34.600
I just watch her plaits disappear
into the crowd outside the Tube.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.960
(PHONE CHIMES)

28:40.080 --> 28:44.200
Text from rodent.
'Still smiling!' Smiley face.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.680
Oh, God!

28:48.040 --> 28:50.040
I text back. 'You free now?'
He is.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.080
We meet up and get very, very drunk.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.320
I can't stop staring at his tiny mouth.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.040
He's telling a story
like he doesn't want to let the words out.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.760
(MUMBLING)

29:10.840 --> 29:13.360
He tells me that his sister is deaf.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.360
Which is his way of letting me know
that he's interesting and sensitive,

29:16.480 --> 29:18.400
which is fine.

29:18.520 --> 29:23.080
But then he is the only one in his family
who didn't learn sign language.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.960
Apparently, because they grew up together,
she can lip-read him brilliantly.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.040
Which makes me wonder
what she thinks he's saying all the time.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.960
To me, it looks like... (MUMBLING)

29:50.160 --> 29:52.400
He tells me his sister is so instinctive.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.200
How she can read people brilliantly.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.160
How she'd be able to read me.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.160
He's having an excellent time.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.240
Harry has terrible instincts.
Once...

30:12.880 --> 30:15.320
I think this might be
the best thing he's ever done.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.080
Once, he was in a restaurant.
He's quite shy really.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.800
He was in a restaurant having had a
filthy night out with me the night before!

30:21.920 --> 30:25.000
I mean, the man was hanging.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.040
And he was having lunch with
these really important website bods,

30:29.160 --> 30:32.480
when suddenly it hit him halfway
through the starter that...

30:32.600 --> 30:35.320
(MIMICKS HARRY) Yeah.
Yeah, he was going to be sick.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.880
Yeah, like, now.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.360
So he excused himself and hurry-walked
to the loo, only to burst in

30:42.480 --> 30:45.400
to discover that all the cubicles
were locked all the urinals were taken

30:45.520 --> 30:47.680
and he couldn't bring himself
to spew in one of the sinks.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.800
So, in a panic,
he kicked down one of the cubicle doors,

30:51.920 --> 30:54.240
revealing a man having a shit.

30:56.800 --> 31:02.480
And then boom, it just all came out.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.080
He puked all over this guy!

31:05.800 --> 31:10.360
His face, his chest, his balls,

31:10.480 --> 31:14.280
his feet, the walls, drenched him!

31:14.400 --> 31:18.240
But then, and this is the best bit,

31:18.360 --> 31:21.600
in the frenzy of it all,
Harry rationalised.

31:21.720 --> 31:25.640
'Oh, God! I just puked on this guy.
He's going to punch me.'

31:25.760 --> 31:27.800
So, he smacked him in the face!

31:38.000 --> 31:39.600
Isn't it beautiful?

31:40.920 --> 31:44.160
It was particularly good
cos when he first told me and Boo

31:44.280 --> 31:46.400
he didn't know it was a funny story.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.160
It will never be heard like that again.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.480
(MIMICKS HARRY) It was
such a serious story.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.320
He was mortified.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.840
Boo loved poo stories,

32:04.960 --> 32:07.480
so she couldn't actually deal
with the glory of this one.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.720
She just stared, open-mouthed,
paralysed with joy as he told it.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.480
A few weeks ago,

32:24.600 --> 32:27.520
when Harry thought I was sleeping,

32:27.640 --> 32:31.040
he rolled over,
stroked my hair and whispered...

32:32.360 --> 32:34.240
(WHISPERS) 'Where have you gone?'

32:40.480 --> 32:42.480
(WHISPERS) 'Where have you gone?'

32:46.640 --> 32:51.480
He thinks I'm neglecting him,
but when your heart is...

32:57.240 --> 32:58.480
I wish he'd just fuck me.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.760
All he wants to do is make love.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.800
He's wasting me.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.520
I was once fucking this guy
who would breathe with every thrust...

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
'You're so young!'

33:11.840 --> 33:13.880
'You're so young!'

33:22.600 --> 33:25.000
I masturbate about that all the time.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.880
I masturbate a lot these days.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.120
Especially when I'm bored

33:35.240 --> 33:38.040
or angry

33:38.160 --> 33:39.600
or upset.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.800
Or happy

33:44.360 --> 33:45.640
Last Tube.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.160
Attempting to kiss Tube Rodent,

33:47.280 --> 33:50.960
but it's like target practice
with a very small moving target.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.280
I ask him if he wants
to come back to mine.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.800
He says he's got work tomorrow.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.200
I say I can go back to his.
He says it's an early start.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.440
I tell him I'll get him a cab to work
in the morning. He says that's ridiculous.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.400
I say, 'What the fuck is your problem?'

34:05.200 --> 34:08.159
He says nothing,
he just wants to see me again, not rush.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.440
I tell him he's a prick.
He say's he's not sure what's going on.

34:12.840 --> 34:16.080
I tell him he's a pathetic excuse for
a man and I leave him at the barriers. Ha!

34:18.440 --> 34:21.679
It's a bit weird then because we both
have to come down the same escalator.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.920
I push my bum out a bit.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.440
Give him some perspective.

34:30.199 --> 34:34.719
I turn round when I get to the platform,
but he's gone.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.159
At the end of the platform,

34:40.280 --> 34:43.280
sat on the sort of bench thing,

34:43.400 --> 34:46.360
is the drunkest girl I have ever seen.

34:47.360 --> 34:53.560
Head rolled forward,
tit hanging out, bag sprawled.

34:53.679 --> 34:57.840
Nicely dressed, normal looking girl
who clearly just had one hell of a night.

34:58.840 --> 35:03.280
Last Tube rolls in, she doesn't move.
I nudge her awake.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.320
She gets up only to stumble onto
the carriage, slump into another seat.

35:07.440 --> 35:14.880
Head still rolling, other tit folded out
now, bag tangled in her feet.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.560
I ask her where she needs to get off
and she says...

35:32.160 --> 35:33.800
'Waterloo.'

35:37.520 --> 35:39.760
Great, my stop. I help her off.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.600
I ask her where she needs
to get to next, and she says...

35:49.600 --> 35:51.080
'London Bridge.'

35:52.760 --> 35:53.800
OK.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.360
And then Kent.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.480
The Tubes are finished, so we're finding
an Overground to London Bridge.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.200
At one point, we're walking
and she just falls flat on her face.

36:08.320 --> 36:12.200
Get her up. Keep going.
Try and keep her talking.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.840
Her head's going all over the place.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.040
After about 45 minutes...

36:18.800 --> 36:20.520
45!

36:22.040 --> 36:23.560
We're on an escalator.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.760
There's a bit of a lull

36:26.880 --> 36:29.240
and she turns to me and she says...

36:31.160 --> 36:32.880
'Aw!'

36:36.360 --> 36:38.840
'You're such a lovely man!'

36:49.480 --> 36:52.000
Her train pulls in,
but I don't let go of her.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.160
I ask her if she'd rather spend
the night with me, and she says...

36:55.280 --> 36:59.800
(SLURRED) 'How dare you, naughty boy. No!'

37:00.320 --> 37:02.880
So I push her on the carriage
and she's gone.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.040
I leave the station and think,
what's one more?

37:06.160 --> 37:11.840
I go to a bar. It's a business bar.
People are doing business.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.040
I drink a lot
and pretend that I'm in business.

37:17.920 --> 37:22.480
A bald, sweaty man
cups my vagina from behind at the bar.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.320
But he buys me a drink, so...

37:32.920 --> 37:34.960
He's nice, actually.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.520
After a while, he disappears.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.720
Then the business bar closes.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.240
Closed for business.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.040
Shutting up shop.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.560
That's what Boo used to say
whenever she closed the café.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.920
'Shutting up shop!'

38:02.040 --> 38:04.560
Like she was drunk.
Which we often were.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.680
We'd lock up, sink a bottle of wine.

38:07.800 --> 38:12.400
She'd play the ukulele
and we'd make up filthy songs for hours.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.760
♪ Another lunch break, another abortion ♪

38:21.000 --> 38:26.520
♪ Another piece of cake
Another two, fuck it, 20 cigarettes ♪

38:26.640 --> 38:35.040
♪ And we're happy,
we're so happy to be modern women ♪

38:36.520 --> 38:38.800
Suddenly, I'm at a familiar doorstep.

38:38.920 --> 38:43.680
I ring the bell and ring the bell and
hammer on the door and yell like a goat.

38:43.800 --> 38:47.200
This should be a humiliating experience,

38:47.320 --> 38:49.560
howling through a man's letterbox
in the middle of the night,

38:49.680 --> 38:51.200
but I'm rolling with it.

38:52.480 --> 38:57.480
A light goes on. I see his silhouette
as he trudges down the stairs.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.880
He must recognise mine through the door,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.080
because his body language
changes suddenly.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.640
He slowly unhooks the latch,
opens the door.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.120
He looks like shit.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.720
I place my hand

39:16.840 --> 39:18.960
right over his face.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.760
And I push it a bit.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.920
Strikes me as something
I never thought I'd do to a parent, but...

39:33.760 --> 39:36.120
..it feels right at the time.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.640
He stands in the doorway,
boxer shorts, T-shirt.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.520
I can see the shape
of his little manboobs.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.280
All right, Dad?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.600
'Um... What's going on?'

39:52.280 --> 39:54.560
Oh. No, no, I'm absolutely fine.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.560
'OK?'

40:00.960 --> 40:05.040
I just, er... I just...

40:06.760 --> 40:08.080
Er...

40:09.120 --> 40:10.360
'Yeah?'

40:12.520 --> 40:13.960
Nothing.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.320
I don't even, um... OK.

40:16.440 --> 40:20.080
I just, er... Oh, sorry.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.760
I'll just...

40:23.720 --> 40:26.120
Ah, fuck it. I have a horrible feeling

40:26.240 --> 40:30.960
that I'm a greedy, perverted,
selfish, apathetic, cynical,

40:31.080 --> 40:33.040
depraved, mannish-looking,

40:33.160 --> 40:36.120
morally bankrupt woman
who can't even call herself a feminist.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.720
He just looks at me.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.160
'Well, er...'

40:55.320 --> 40:57.160
'You get all that from your mother.'

41:07.160 --> 41:08.440
Good one.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.720
I wonder if he'd find me attractive
if I wasn't his daughter.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.640
If you saw me on the internet...

41:25.600 --> 41:27.240
..would you click on me?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.440
'I'm going to call you a cab, darling'

41:38.280 --> 41:41.520
He lets me wait in his living room
as he calls me a cab.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.400
I can hear my godmother trying
to be quiet at the top of the stairs.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.720
When the cab comes, he gently puts
me into it. Gives me 20 quid.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.320
I'm in a cab.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.880
I can go anywhere.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.920
So, I tell him to take me to...

42:17.920 --> 42:19.120
...my flat.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.400
Already thinking about
what I'm going to look up.

42:23.520 --> 42:26.040
(WOMAN PANTING
AND GROANING SEXUALLY)

42:28.920 --> 42:32.400
Back at the flat.
I turn on the TV and cry for a bit.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.080
I start thinking
about this girl called Lily

42:35.200 --> 42:37.600
I used to touch a bit when we were drunk.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.320
Harry didn't know, but girls don't count.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.440
I text her.
She lives quite close, I think.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.200
Suddenly, I'm on PornHub,
wet as a beach towel,

42:47.320 --> 42:49.560
but I can't get there
cos the girl's got spots on her arse.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.440
Some of them just don't make the effort.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.960
Nothing back from Lily.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.440
I start thinking about this ginger guy
I met at a festival last summer.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.040
It was about a month after Boo had died.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.360
I'd taken a pill,
and flown off into the woods.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.400
I was desperate to get away from Harry.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.240
He'd started to relentlessly hug me,
telling me how much he loved me,

43:13.360 --> 43:16.040
asking how much I loved him
and checking if I was OK.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.200
There was a rave in the wood.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.240
I was panicking
and touching my face a lot.

43:24.360 --> 43:27.040
And suddenly he was there, ginger guy.

43:28.120 --> 43:31.840
He told me that I could follow him
and he would take me back to my tent.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.040
We were walking for ages.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.720
He was holding me by my wrist.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.960
It was very dark.
I couldn't work out where we were.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.840
At one point, he even picked me up.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.200
He was holding my legs really tightly.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.520
Said that I was too weak to walk
and I had to trust him.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.080
Eventually, we stopped.

43:59.080 --> 44:02.000
I felt him lie me down
on my back in a tent.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.280
And then he...

44:07.680 --> 44:08.880
He...

44:11.840 --> 44:14.360
He put a cover over me
and a bottle of water next to my arm

44:14.480 --> 44:16.600
and he sat outside till I fell asleep.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.960
Thought he could have at least tried
to touch me up a bit.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.600
I never quite let that go.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.480
I text him. Tell him I'm single and horny.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.120
He says he's out
and can be here in 20 minutes.

44:35.240 --> 44:38.640
Great. Quickly drink half a bottle of
wine, get in the shower, shave everything.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.360
Decide I'm going
to up my game a little bit.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.360
Pull out some Agent Provocateur
business, suspender belt, the whole bit.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.920
Open the door to him. Hello.
We get to it immediately.

44:48.040 --> 44:51.240
After some pretty standard bouncing,

44:51.360 --> 44:54.600
I realise he's edging
towards my arsehole.

44:56.080 --> 44:59.080
But I'm drunk, and I owe him a thank you
for being nice to me at the festival,

44:59.200 --> 45:01.040
so...

45:01.160 --> 45:02.440
I let him.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.720
He's thrilled!

45:06.760 --> 45:08.520
The next morning,

45:08.640 --> 45:16.600
I wake to find him sitting on the bed,
fully dressed, gazing at me.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.680
He tells me that last night
was incredible.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.320
Which I think was an overstatement.

45:22.680 --> 45:25.640
He goes on to say
it was particularly special

45:25.760 --> 45:27.720
because he's never actually managed to...

45:30.120 --> 45:33.760
..up the bum with anyone before.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.960
To be fair, he does have a large penis,

45:36.080 --> 45:38.360
and even though
it's always been a fantasy of his,

45:38.480 --> 45:41.120
he'd never found anyone
he could do it with.

45:41.760 --> 45:46.680
He touches my hair
and thanks me with a genuine earnest.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.400
It's sort of moving.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.720
Then he kisses me gently.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.560
I kiss him back.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.120
And then he leaves.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.280
And I spend the rest of the day
wondering...

46:18.120 --> 46:20.760
Do I have massive arsehole?

46:34.520 --> 46:37.400
It's five to 11 at the café.
I'm still thinking about it.

46:39.240 --> 46:43.080
I haven't heard from my sister.
No transfer yet.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.680
I wonder if Martin's murdered her, and
is now stalking the city looking for me.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.680
The door smashes open.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
His legs are too long for his body.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.040
'Look at this beauty!'

46:57.160 --> 47:01.200
He holds up a ukulele that apparently
someone gave him in a pub last night.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.240
Just gave him a ukulele.

47:03.840 --> 47:06.480
He says he's written a song.
I don't want to hear it.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.720
He holds up another ukulele

47:08.840 --> 47:13.720
that apparently another person
gave him in another pub.

47:14.760 --> 47:17.040
'Crazy how the world speaks
to you all at once, eh!'

47:18.640 --> 47:22.240
He says he's going to sing his song to me.
Then he's going to teach it to me.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.760
So we can both sing it to Hilary.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.560
I tell him I'm too busy and sit out
the back till I hear him leave.

47:29.400 --> 47:35.200
He tinkles a bit,
but... I don't hear him sing.

(UKULELE PLAYING
FAINTLY IN DISTANCE)

47:40.040 --> 47:44.000
School kids used to come into the café.
Mainly because of Hilary.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.960
Basically, I'm shit at presents
and for Boo's birthday two years ago

47:47.080 --> 47:48.440
I panicked and bought her a guinea pig.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.720
She called it Hilary
and now I'm stuck with it.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.520
I don't feel anything about guinea pigs.
They're pointless.

47:53.640 --> 47:56.000
But Boo took Hilary
very seriously as a gift

47:56.120 --> 47:58.920
and soon everything
became guinea pig related.

47:59.560 --> 48:02.840
I think she was just relieved to have
another animal associated with her.

48:03.440 --> 48:11.520
When Boo was about five, she mentioned,
on a childish whim, that she liked owls.

48:13.400 --> 48:16.520
For the rest of her life, she got owls.

48:17.680 --> 48:23.680
Owl duvet covers, owl pens, books
about owls, trips to owl sanctuaries.

48:23.800 --> 48:28.920
She fucking hated owls. Show her an owl
and she would lose her shit.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.440
What she really liked, and I knew this,
was screwdrivers.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.800
She was crazy about them.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.840
We'd spend hours unscrewing things.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.320
Screwing them back up.

48:49.240 --> 48:52.560
She slept with screwdrivers
under her pillow till she was about ten.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.560
Come to think of it,

48:56.680 --> 48:58.640
a screwdriver would have been
a better present than a...

49:00.320 --> 49:01.840
..guinea pig.

49:03.840 --> 49:06.880
Midday. Still nothing from my sister.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.280
Martin's going to hate me.
I picture his massive Scottish head.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.240
Hope he hasn't beaten
the shit out of her or anything.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.840
Nah, he'd never do anything
as sexy as that.

49:21.720 --> 49:23.360
I'm joking!

49:23.480 --> 49:24.760
I'm joking.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.080
Jesus! OK.

49:30.920 --> 49:35.280
Hilary is fat and ginger with frizzy bits,
like Annie the orphan.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.280
If she was grown up,
and fat, and a guinea pig.

49:39.040 --> 49:42.000
Which... Well, who knows
what became of her?

49:43.360 --> 49:45.080
She's got this sort of punky bit of fur

49:45.200 --> 49:49.000
that explodes off the crown
of her head and falls down over her eyes.

49:49.120 --> 49:53.240
Makes her look pretty badass.
She has a very straight expression.

49:54.520 --> 49:56.560
Boo always said
that if Hilary was in a band,

49:56.680 --> 50:00.280
she'd be the guitarist
that takes the music really seriously.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.560
She did take music seriously, actually.

50:04.680 --> 50:07.800

in the café she'd be all...

She knows how to open her hutch door.
I've seen her do it.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.600
She pushes the little wood stopper till
it drops out and the door swings open.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.240
Then she freezes!

50:47.120 --> 50:49.600
Like she hasn't done anything.

50:49.720 --> 50:53.360
Then she actually turns herself around

50:53.480 --> 50:56.400
and lowers herself down onto the counter,

50:56.520 --> 50:58.480
little legs kicking,

50:58.600 --> 51:01.560
looking over her shoulder occasionally,
checking.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.160
Checking.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.280
She often does
a little poo in the excitement.

51:17.080 --> 51:21.440
Then, once landed, she creeps...

51:25.880 --> 51:29.960
..all the way along the counter
till she gets to the window.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.920

51:33.040 --> 51:35.240
in her frenzy of freedom...

51:37.040 --> 51:40.640
..she sits down and she looks out.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.280
Watching the world.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.440
If she wants me to think she's really
profound and poetic doing that,

51:48.560 --> 51:50.040
I'm not rising to it.

51:51.680 --> 51:56.160
Apparently, guinea pigs need other
guinea pigs or they can die of loneliness.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.760
But Hilary never needed a mate.
She got more than enough attention.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.080
The punters loved her,
she was always on someone's lap,

52:01.200 --> 52:03.920
and she had Boo,
who never left her alone.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.160
They adored each other.

52:07.080 --> 52:11.840
The morning Boo's boyfriend told her
he'd fucked someone else,

52:11.960 --> 52:16.360
she walked right past me,
took Hilary out of her hutch

52:16.480 --> 52:18.640
and sat out the back with her for hours.

52:22.520 --> 52:27.000
I once read a story from the paper
to Boo and Hilary about a little boy

52:27.120 --> 52:31.400
who repeatedly stuck rubber-ended pencils
up the class hamster's arsehole

52:31.520 --> 52:33.760
cos he liked it
when their eyes popped out.

52:34.480 --> 52:36.760
He was sent to a juvenile boot camp.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.720
I read it out as a bit of a joke really,
but Boo was distraught.

52:40.840 --> 52:45.800
'What? They sent him away?
But he needs help!'

52:47.040 --> 52:48.840
She was a surprising person.

52:49.720 --> 52:51.920
Yeah, he pencil fucked a hamster.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.800
What are you gonna do?

52:55.080 --> 52:59.840
'Yeah, but he's obviously not happy.
Happy people don't do things like that.'

53:01.040 --> 53:02.840
Fair point.

53:02.960 --> 53:06.520
'And anyway, that's the very reason
they put rubbers on the ends of pencils.'

53:10.120 --> 53:13.440
What, er... What, to fuck hamsters?

53:14.840 --> 53:17.480
'No! No.'

53:17.600 --> 53:21.440
'Because... people make mistakes.'

53:26.280 --> 53:31.200
But now Boo's gone it's a death café,
so no-one comes in any more.

53:32.600 --> 53:36.760

staring at me.

turns his phone on,
then he screams, really high-pitched.

She must have wandered over to the window
while we were having sex.

For a second, I laugh at his reaction,
but she moves, and he screams again.

She tries to run towards me,
but panics and sort of slips off the side.

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:52.400
Hilary's making this horrible,
chattering noise.

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.520
I take her out of her hutch, put her on
my lap, stroke her but she doesn't stop.

1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:00.960
I put her back.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.080
I go to the Rabbit and Winslow pub.

1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:07.160
I smoke outside. There are three
people laughing by the door.

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:10.880
I can just make out the white hair
and the braces through the crowd.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.680
(FAINT CONVERSATION, LAUGHTER)
I can hear him.

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.720
(UKULELE STRUMMING)

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:19.240
Someone's let him on stage
with his ukulele.

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:24.640
He's singing his song.
People are laughing and clapping.

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:28.400
I listen to it from outside.

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:31.840
It's about a train journey
he once took through Ireland,

1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:34.040
where he met a man
who told stories to everyone

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:38.520
about love and home
and romance and adventure.

1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:42.600
And beautiful women and beautiful men
and mothers and daughters.

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.480
And fathers and sons and monsters
and fairies and parties and wishes.

1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:50.880
All the usual crap.

1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.960
The whole scene is like something out of
a revolting rom com, but he's nailing it.

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:02.360
He goes to the bar after.
Everyone buys him drinks.

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.520
The man doesn't need to work.

1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.560
I realise I'd forgotten
to give Hilary her Earl Grey.

1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:13.040
10:30 that night.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:15.480
I hammer and hammer and ring the bell.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:21.120
I can see his silhouette at the top of
the stairs, but he doesn't open the door.

1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:26.320
Back at the flat,
Harry's obviously been round.

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:29.120
The TV has gone
and it smells like he did a shit.

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:32.520
He never used to shit in the flat.
He was really weird about it.

1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:34.440
Used to go to the pub across the road.

1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:40.600
I sit on my stripy sofa.

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:43.440
Open my laptop.

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:02.760
Suddenly,
the sun's creeping in and I'm raw.

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:05.160
Lease is up today. Still nothing
from my sister. I leave the flat.

1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:06.560
Hi, this is Boo...

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:08.440
I've put the closing sign
up outside the café.

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:16.840
Three minutes past 11.
He's not here yet.

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:22.600
Ten past. The door flies open.

'I'm a little late, but have I got
a morning story for you or what!'

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.360
'Listen to this.'

1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:33.720
I tell him to shut up and close the door.
He looks confused, but he does it.

1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.440
Why do you come here, Joe?

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:47.320
'What?'

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:51.480
I lock the door and close the blinds.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:55.240
Why do you come here, Joe?

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:02.240
'Tea, love. See my ladies.'

1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:06.840
Hilary's not moving.

1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:11.280
It's OK, Joe. I understand.

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:14.640
There's nothing wrong with you.

1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:20.640
I take off my top, unhook my bra
and place them gently on the counter.

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:23.840
He stares at me.

1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:29.040
I step forward,
showing him my young tits.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:41.560
He shuffles a bit. His breathing changes.
He's trembling. He moves his hand up.

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:48.080
Nine o'clock that morning. My sister's
door. Martin looking down at me.

1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:49.840
'Hello, you.'

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:53.400
Is Claire here?
'Aye.'

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.160
I try to get past him into the house,
but he won't let me.

1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:00.920
Claire comes to the door.
She's crimped her fringe.

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:07.920
I deliver a beautifully constructed joke
about it, but she snaps at me.

1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:10.800
Tells me I've got to stop talking to
people like I'm doing a stand-up routine,

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:12.560
that some things
just aren't fucking funny.

1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:16.280
I laugh.

1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:20.200
And then I don't laugh.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:26.200
Then my throat goes dry.
No-one says anything for a bit.

1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:30.640
You didn't transfer the money.

1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:34.560
'No.'

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:38.680
You're not going to Finland.

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:42.120
'No.'

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:45.760
Why is he still here?

1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:49.800
'He didn't touch you.'

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:52.840
He tried.

1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:57.880
'He said it was more like
the other way round.'

1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:03.640
What? But that's just not true.

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:07.080

That wasn't my fault.

1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:36.280
He wanted me.

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:39.440
So...

1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.440
11.15 now. Joe's shaking.

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.559
I'm standing, topless,
just the right angle.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.600
His hand keeps rising,
till it rests on his eyes.

1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:04.319
'Put your clothes back on, darling.'

1:09:07.399 --> 1:09:09.200

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:12.240
'Put your clothes back on.'

1:09:14.719 --> 1:09:18.840
It's OK, Joe. I'm not going to judge you.

'I... I come here for my tea, darling.'

1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:29.479
'And to see you.'

1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:02.960
He stops.

1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:07.600
He brings his hand down from his eyes
and he finally looks at me.

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:14.360
'Go home, darling.'

1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.120
'I'm sorry, but this ain't my bag.'

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.639
I grab his arm as he walks past me.

1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:30.559
He's thin but baggy. His skin
pinches in my grasp. It's disgusting.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:35.800

There's something not right
about that man.

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.240
Hilary's teeth are going again,
crashing against each other.

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.040
The noise is unbearable,
this relentless, relentless chattering.

1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:51.719
They do that when they're in pain
or distressed. I can't listen to it.

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:54.800
I take her out her hutch.

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:58.400
I hold her little body to my naked chest.

1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:02.240
I can feel her claws.

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:06.120
Her bones feel bent
and her breathing is shallow,

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:10.360
but her teeth are going like... I can't...

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:15.520
I look into her face
through her little punky bit.

1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:21.680
I imagine sticking my finger in
to make her eyes pop out.

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:26.080
I imagine that. I imagine doing that.

1:11:28.719 --> 1:11:30.880
As my hand moves down
her body I...

1:11:33.719 --> 1:11:35.200

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.719
When I first gave her to Boo
she was so tiny.

1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:44.960
I put her in this little gift box
from a crappy card shop.

1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:47.960
She just sat on this bit of cotton wool
looking up through her tiny punky bit.

1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:51.719
She was ridiculous,
this overexcited little fuzzball.

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:53.360
She'd just sit in your hand like...

1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:57.320
Boo's face!

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:05.320
Boo's face when she opened that box.
A huge grin spread over her whole body.

Did you get...? What is this?'

I don't know. Something to love?

I'm crying. My fingers are gripping her.

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:29.760
But I can't...

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:34.000
I can feel how scared she is.

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.559
How much pain she's in.

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:41.280
But I can't...

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.440
I hold her to me tightly.

I hold her to me tighter
until I feel her bones crack against me

What if I wrote
that I fucked that café into liquidation?

That I fucked up my family, that I fucked
my friend by fucking her boyfriend.

1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:37.760
That I don't feel alive
unless I'm being fucked,

I don't feel in control unless I'm fucking

tighten around me.

I've been watching people fuck for
as long as I've been able to search for it

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:47.960
and that I know that my body as it is now
really is the only thing I that have.

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:51.120
And when that gets old and unfuckable
I may as well just kill it.

And that sometimes I wish that
I didn't even know that fucking existed

because somehow there isn't anything worse
than someone who doesn't want to fuck me.

1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:01.320
That I fuck everything but this time...

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:03.800
This time I really wasn't,
I genuinely...

1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:12.320
Either everyone feels like this
a little bit...

..and they're just not talking about it...

Not for the first time.

It's ruined the reputation of the business
I've been building up my whole life,

1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:04.719
and has completely alienated me
from my family.

- Why did you do it?
- It was a terrible mistake.

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:17.680
- People make mistakes
- Yes, they do.

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:22.719

on the ends of pencils.

- Shall we start this interview again?
- OK.

Really appreciate you sending in your CV

1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:06.400
- No problem.
- It was funny.
