00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:35.249 --> 00:36.716
We need this completely filled.

00:36.783 --> 00:38.774
We don't have time
to haggle over price.

00:38.852 --> 00:40.319
Understood.

00:44.758 --> 00:45.725
Captain.

01:05.412 --> 01:06.879
Janeway to Voy...

01:06.947 --> 01:07.811
Get up!

01:17.457 --> 01:18.754
Get away from her!

03:19.179 --> 03:20.271
Commander...

03:20.347 --> 03:21.712
any word on that tellerium?

03:21.782 --> 03:22.749
Not yet.

03:22.816 --> 03:23.874
How bad is it?

03:23.950 --> 03:26.544
The antimatter reaction rate
is down to 12 percent.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.053
If it drops below nine,

03:28.121 --> 03:29.213
the plasma injectors
will lock up

03:29.289 --> 03:31.587
and we'll never be able
to reinitialize the nacelles.

03:31.658 --> 03:32.920
Options?

03:32.993 --> 03:35.223
If we're going to reduce
our power demands even further,

03:35.295 --> 03:37.160
we're going to have
to drop the shields.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.891
I don't want to leave
the ship defenseless

03:38.965 --> 03:40.455
this close to a hostile planet.

03:40.534 --> 03:42.661
All other systems
are already off-line.

03:42.736 --> 03:43.930
Life support is at minimal.

03:44.004 --> 03:45.403
You asked for options.

03:45.472 --> 03:46.769
Thas our last one.

03:48.442 --> 03:50.376
All right,
power down the shields.

03:59.119 --> 04:00.916
That helped.

04:00.987 --> 04:02.318
ls only a matter of time.

04:02.389 --> 04:04.289
There's nothing more we can do
without the tellerium.

04:04.357 --> 04:06.291
Neelix to Voyager.

04:06.359 --> 04:07.519
Yes, Neelix.

04:07.594 --> 04:09.562
The rest of the away team
is gone, Commander.

04:09.629 --> 04:10.891
They've been taken by the Mokra.

04:10.964 --> 04:13.125
What do you want me to do?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.258
Did you get the tellerium?

04:14.334 --> 04:15.858
Yes, I have it.

04:15.936 --> 04:17.197
Then we need you here.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.204
Prepare to beam directly
to Engineering.

04:19.272 --> 04:22.366
Rerouting emergency power
to Transporter Room 2.

04:22.442 --> 04:23.704
And...

04:23.777 --> 04:25.142
energizing.

04:31.985 --> 04:34.749
Chakotay to away team.
Captain, can you hear me?

04:35.822 --> 04:37.221
Unlock the control conduit.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.558
Tuvok, Torres,

04:40.627 --> 04:42.595
please respond.

04:42.662 --> 04:43.754
Keep an eye on the flow rate.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.797
Yes, sir.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.168
Rate's holding steady.

04:49.236 --> 04:51.670
The reaction rate
is stabilized

04:51.771 --> 04:53.261
at 13 percent.

04:53.340 --> 04:57.299
Up to 15...18.

04:57.377 --> 04:58.935
It worked then.
We're all right?

04:59.012 --> 04:59.944
Maybe.

05:00.013 --> 05:01.378
Once the rate is up to normal,

05:01.481 --> 05:03.915
we'll try getting
the warp drive back on line.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.144
Then we'll see
if there was any damage.

05:05.218 --> 05:07.743
Begin rerouting power
back to all key systems.

05:07.821 --> 05:09.288
What happened down there?

05:09.356 --> 05:11.756
I don't know, exactly.

05:11.825 --> 05:13.190
I went in the shop,
completed the trade,

05:13.260 --> 05:15.387
then I heard weapons fire
on the street.

05:15.462 --> 05:16.588
By the time I got out there,

05:16.696 --> 05:18.323
the Captain
and the others were gone.

05:18.398 --> 05:19.592
Are you sure it was the Mokra?

05:19.666 --> 05:21.964
I spoke to witnesses
on the street.

05:22.035 --> 05:23.969
They said it was quite a fight.

05:24.037 --> 05:26.198
Any idea how the Mokra
knew you were down there?

05:27.674 --> 05:30.268
Someone must have told them
we were coming.

05:30.343 --> 05:33.073
The Mokra have informants
everywhere.

05:33.146 --> 05:35.011
Could your contact
be one of them?

05:35.081 --> 05:37.549
I don't think I would have
made it back here

05:37.617 --> 05:39.551
with the tellerium
if he had been.

05:39.619 --> 05:41.610
Besides, he's involved

05:41.688 --> 05:43.212
with the Alsaurian
resistance movement.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.087
He would never help the Mokra.

05:45.158 --> 05:46.955
They've probably got
the resistance movement

05:47.027 --> 05:48.289
under surveillance.

05:48.361 --> 05:49.555
Commander.

05:49.629 --> 05:51.688
I think we're ready
to give the engines a try.

05:57.203 --> 05:59.501
I'm opening
the plasma injectors.

06:08.682 --> 06:11.776
Warp engines are back on line.

06:11.851 --> 06:13.478
All systems normal.

06:13.553 --> 06:15.077
Good work, Mr. Kim.

06:15.155 --> 06:16.520
Mr. Neelix, you're with me.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.024
I thinkit's time
we contact the Mokra.

06:21.361 --> 06:23.124
Mr. Paris, set a new course.

06:23.196 --> 06:24.527
Bring us out
from behind the moon

06:24.598 --> 06:26.759
and establish a standard orbit
around the planet... slowly.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.095
We don't want
to look aggressive.

06:28.168 --> 06:29.396
Yes, sir.

06:29.469 --> 06:32.336
What kind of response should
we expect when they see us?

06:32.405 --> 06:34.896
The Mokra are paranoid
and hostile.

06:34.975 --> 06:36.875
They have little use
for diplomacy.

06:36.943 --> 06:37.910
I wouldn't be surprised

06:37.978 --> 06:41.209
if they started shooting
at us immediately.

06:41.281 --> 06:43.806
We'll be in full view
of the planet in a few seconds.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.888
Their orbital sensor net
has picked us up.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.756
They're scanning the ship.

06:57.097 --> 06:58.587
We're being hailed.

06:58.665 --> 06:59.632
On screen.

07:01.001 --> 07:04.835
I am Third Magistrate Augris
of the Mokra Order.

07:04.904 --> 07:07.964
Commander Chakotay of the
Federation Starship Voyager.

07:08.041 --> 07:10.703
May I assume
you're seeking permission

07:10.777 --> 07:12.711
to conduct business with us?

07:12.779 --> 07:14.474
No. Some of my crew members

07:14.547 --> 07:16.139
have already been
to the surface.

07:16.216 --> 07:17.843
We've lost contact with them.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.544
I see.

07:19.686 --> 07:22.985
You must have been unaware
of our regulations.

07:23.056 --> 07:25.923
I'll transfer a complete copy
for future reference.

07:25.992 --> 07:28.961
I have reason to believe
they're being detained.

07:29.029 --> 07:30.428
Detained?

07:30.497 --> 07:32.192
Thas possible.

07:32.265 --> 07:33.755
I'll look into it for you.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.960
I'll contact you shortly.

07:36.036 --> 07:37.401
Thank you.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.831
He's not like any Mokra
I've ever met.

07:41.908 --> 07:43.899
I can't believe
he'll really help us.

07:43.977 --> 07:46.002
If there's any chance
for a diplomatic solution,

07:46.079 --> 07:47.171
we have to pursue it.

07:47.247 --> 07:49.738
In the meantime, I want
continuous scans of the surface.

07:49.816 --> 07:51.807
Standard search pattern.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.769
I advise caution.

08:13.773 --> 08:16.003
There's a control circuit there.
I can see it.

08:21.147 --> 08:23.172
If only we knew
that Neelix made it

08:23.249 --> 08:25.183
back to the ship
with the tellerium,

08:25.251 --> 08:27.583
then at least this
would be worth it.

08:27.654 --> 08:31.647
I regret I have no such
reassurance to offer you.

08:31.725 --> 08:33.488
We don't even know what
happened to the Captain.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.585
She might have been killed
out there on the street.

08:35.695 --> 08:37.162
That is possible.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.765
It is also possible

08:40.833 --> 08:42.597
that she has safely
returned to Voyager.

08:42.702 --> 08:44.067
We have insufficient evidence

08:44.136 --> 08:46.537
to dismiss either conclusion.

08:48.441 --> 08:50.102
I guess thas the Vulcan way

08:50.176 --> 08:52.201
of telling me
to hope for the best.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.812
Look who's awake.

09:33.153 --> 09:35.053
Just rest.

09:35.121 --> 09:37.214
You must be thirsty.

09:37.290 --> 09:40.191
Maybe hungry?

09:40.260 --> 09:42.194
For a little something?

09:46.132 --> 09:47.759
Oh, what shall I make?

09:47.834 --> 09:51.531
What, what can I make?
What, what?

09:53.706 --> 09:55.469
Oh...

09:59.379 --> 10:00.368
Where am I?

10:00.446 --> 10:03.074
Oh, it hasn't been that long.

10:03.149 --> 10:05.879
I wish I had some...
There.

10:05.952 --> 10:08.284
This will do.

10:12.225 --> 10:14.250
T- To drink.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.797
Thank you.

10:21.868 --> 10:23.665
I'll fix you some soup.

10:23.736 --> 10:27.672
Now, just...lie down.

10:27.740 --> 10:28.798
You're very kind, but I have...

10:28.875 --> 10:30.809
ls all right.
You're safe now.

10:30.877 --> 10:31.536
I really can't...

10:31.611 --> 10:33.841
Shh, shh.

10:33.913 --> 10:35.380
Don't worry.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.313
Everything's all right now.

10:40.386 --> 10:42.217
My little girl is home.

11:11.517 --> 11:12.745
I'm very grateful

11:12.819 --> 11:13.979
for everything
you've done for me.

11:14.053 --> 11:15.850
But you know there's
nothing I wouldn't do

11:15.922 --> 11:16.889
for my sweet Ralkana.

11:16.956 --> 11:20.517
My name is Kathryn Janeway.

11:20.593 --> 11:21.958
"Kathryn"?

11:22.028 --> 11:24.394
Thas an unusual name.

11:24.464 --> 11:26.398
Very pretty.

11:26.466 --> 11:27.865
l- I like it.

11:27.934 --> 11:29.925
I am a starship Captain.

11:30.003 --> 11:33.700
It is very important
that I contact my ship.

11:34.774 --> 11:36.173
Wonderful.

11:36.242 --> 11:41.737
Captain...Kathryn
of a glorious starship.

11:43.082 --> 11:44.515
Then what happens?

11:44.584 --> 11:45.846
Go on.

11:45.919 --> 11:46.908
I'm listening.

11:46.986 --> 11:47.953
I love your stories.

11:48.021 --> 11:49.420
ls not a story.

11:49.489 --> 11:51.514
ls a request.

11:51.591 --> 11:53.855
May I use
your communications equipment?

11:53.927 --> 11:55.690
Communications...

11:55.762 --> 11:58.322
Uh, we're not supposed
to have any of that.

11:58.398 --> 12:00.059
The Mokra don't allow it.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.226
They can't have control
of everything.

12:02.335 --> 12:04.997
Surely there's someone
who has an illegal transmitter.

12:05.038 --> 12:08.906
I know what you'd like...
some talsa root soup.

12:10.710 --> 12:11.608
Can you at least tell me

12:11.711 --> 12:12.939
what happened
to the other people

12:13.012 --> 12:14.070
I was with on the street?

12:14.147 --> 12:16.138
You really should be
more careful out there.

12:16.215 --> 12:20.015
Those Mokra will pick
a fight for no reason.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.850
I don't want you
getting hurt...again.

12:23.890 --> 12:27.826
But I saw the way you
handled that ugly one.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.653
I couldn't have done any better.

12:31.764 --> 12:33.664
I was so proud of you, Ralkana.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.634
My two friends...
did the Mokra take them?

12:36.703 --> 12:37.795
I'm afraid so.

12:37.870 --> 12:39.565
Where would they
have been taken?

12:39.639 --> 12:40.697
A detention center?

12:43.209 --> 12:44.301
The prison.

12:45.511 --> 12:46.671
All right.

12:46.746 --> 12:47.906
How do I get there?

12:47.981 --> 12:49.471
Soup.

12:49.549 --> 12:50.880
I'm forgetting the soup.

12:50.950 --> 12:54.511
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I can't stay here.

12:54.587 --> 12:56.020
I've got to get to that prison.

12:56.089 --> 12:57.454
You're right,
the time has come.

12:57.523 --> 13:01.015
Now we're together again,
we can't wait another day.

13:01.094 --> 13:05.190
My beautiful and brave...
girl.

13:05.264 --> 13:08.392
The Mokra won't stand
a chance against us.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.567
You're very kind to offer,

13:12.638 --> 13:15.232
but I didn't mean
we'd be going together.

13:15.308 --> 13:21.269
You must eat and rest
to get your strength back.

13:21.347 --> 13:22.609
We'll leave soon enough.

13:22.682 --> 13:23.979
We don't want
to keep her waiting

13:24.050 --> 13:25.483
any longer than we have to.

13:29.455 --> 13:30.979
Keep who waiting?

13:32.492 --> 13:36.326
She must miss you so terribly.

13:36.396 --> 13:38.489
ls hard to bear...

13:38.564 --> 13:42.159
thinking of her alone
in that dark cell.

13:44.604 --> 13:46.196
ls been difficult
for all of us,

13:46.272 --> 13:49.867
but don't worry,
we'll get her out.

13:49.942 --> 13:52.308
You'll see your mother again.

14:03.389 --> 14:05.584
Our world has come
under attack before.

14:05.658 --> 14:07.990
You can understand our concern

14:08.061 --> 14:11.224
at finding strangers
who arrive secretly

14:11.297 --> 14:13.265
from a hidden ship.

14:13.332 --> 14:16.301
I assure you, we have
no hostile intentions.

14:16.369 --> 14:19.566
I believe you,
but some of my colleagues

14:19.639 --> 14:23.200
are cautious
about dealing with...

14:23.276 --> 14:24.709
disreputable ships.

14:24.777 --> 14:26.472
What does that mean?

14:28.414 --> 14:31.144
It seems you've been making
more enemies than friends

14:31.217 --> 14:32.616
since you arrived from the...

14:32.718 --> 14:34.549
Alpha Quadrant, is it?

14:34.620 --> 14:37.714
Some think even that story
is a lie.

14:37.790 --> 14:38.779
But not you.

14:38.858 --> 14:40.120
Of course not.

14:40.193 --> 14:41.785
I am here to help.

14:43.563 --> 14:45.963
Then I'd like to talk
to my crew members.

14:46.032 --> 14:48.023
I'm afraid
that will be difficult

14:48.101 --> 14:50.399
in the current climate
of mistrust.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.064
Perhaps if you could tell us

14:53.139 --> 14:54.606
more about
what brought you here...

14:54.674 --> 14:56.665
who you've been dealing with.

14:56.776 --> 14:58.869
I'll consider that

14:58.945 --> 15:00.810
after I talk to my crew members.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.907
You're not making it very easy
for me to help you.

15:09.722 --> 15:12.316
Let me see what I can arrange.

15:12.391 --> 15:14.359
It may take some time.

15:14.427 --> 15:15.416
Commander.

15:23.169 --> 15:25.160
Talk to your contacts again.

15:25.238 --> 15:26.865
I want an alternative
to sitting here

15:26.939 --> 15:28.463
waiting for him
to get back to us.

15:31.043 --> 15:33.511
Your question is based
on a faulty assumption.

15:33.579 --> 15:34.944
I cannot answer it.

15:35.014 --> 15:36.208
You can't deny

15:36.282 --> 15:38.716
being in contact
with the resistance.

15:38.784 --> 15:41.548
I deny that we are intending
to supply them with weapons.

15:41.621 --> 15:43.851
These lies are useless.

15:43.923 --> 15:46.255
We know you're helping
the subversives.

15:46.325 --> 15:48.987
I want names.

15:49.061 --> 15:50.528
I have none to give you.

15:50.596 --> 15:52.291
He told you already...
we don't know anything

15:52.365 --> 15:53.798
about the resistance!

15:53.866 --> 15:58.565
I've heard that many times
from many people.

15:58.638 --> 16:00.071
Take him.

16:01.874 --> 16:04.035
Lieutenant, stop!

16:04.110 --> 16:05.907
That will not help either of us.

16:05.978 --> 16:07.741
He's right.

16:21.327 --> 16:22.259
Open up!

16:22.328 --> 16:23.260
No!

16:23.329 --> 16:24.557
Break it down!

16:28.701 --> 16:29.599
I see soldiers out there.

16:29.702 --> 16:30.999
Whas happening?

16:31.070 --> 16:32.298
They're everywhere...

16:32.371 --> 16:33.338
searching the whole area.

16:33.406 --> 16:34.600
I don't want to cause
trouble for you.

16:34.674 --> 16:35.902
I'll go soon asit's dark.

16:35.975 --> 16:37.374
You've always been
a troublemaker

16:37.443 --> 16:38.603
ever since you could walk.

16:38.678 --> 16:40.737
I've never seen
such a willful child.

16:40.813 --> 16:42.610
But thas what I love
most about you...

16:42.682 --> 16:43.706
your spirit.

16:43.783 --> 16:44.841
Now, don't worry.

16:44.917 --> 16:47.818
When they come through here,
we'll be gone already.

16:47.887 --> 16:51.983
Now, your mother will want
some of her things.

16:54.060 --> 16:57.120
Ah...a pretty dress to wear.

16:58.197 --> 16:59.664
They're only looking for me.

16:59.765 --> 17:01.255
You don't have to get
any more involved

17:01.367 --> 17:02.459
than you already are.

17:02.501 --> 17:04.298
Why, if my precious girl
is involved

17:04.369 --> 17:05.564
then I'm involved, too.

17:14.247 --> 17:15.874
Do you remember this?

17:15.948 --> 17:18.541
She always used to wear it
on special occasions.

17:18.617 --> 17:22.554
I think today
would count...as one.

17:22.688 --> 17:25.680
You know what I think
she would like even more...

17:28.361 --> 17:30.420
is to see you wear it.

17:30.496 --> 17:31.758
I couldn't possibly take it...

17:31.831 --> 17:34.026
Be careful, be careful
this won't heal

17:34.100 --> 17:35.692
if you move around too much.

17:35.768 --> 17:38.100
If you want to help,
tell me about that prison.

17:38.170 --> 17:39.694
What kind of security
do they have?

17:39.772 --> 17:40.796
Are there force fields,

17:40.873 --> 17:42.431
detection grids,
physical barriers?

17:42.508 --> 17:44.476
Yes, all of it.

17:44.543 --> 17:45.510
What about guards?

17:45.578 --> 17:46.875
Lots of guards.

17:46.946 --> 17:49.938
The Mokra make
a big show of it...

17:50.016 --> 17:54.282
always bragging about how no one
has ever escaped.

17:54.353 --> 17:56.287
Listen to me...

17:56.355 --> 17:59.188
I can't bring you
to the prison with me.

17:59.258 --> 18:01.419
lt's too dangerous.

18:04.196 --> 18:05.424
I'm not afraid.

18:05.498 --> 18:07.625
And that could get
both of us killed.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.725
You have to stay here.

18:09.802 --> 18:13.636
If I stay here I can't
bring the letters.

18:13.706 --> 18:15.936
Letters...to the prison?

18:16.008 --> 18:17.339
Letters.

18:17.410 --> 18:19.742
Don't you remember
how we used to write

18:19.812 --> 18:21.336
to her together?

18:28.054 --> 18:30.022
Here they are.

18:30.089 --> 18:31.784
I still write them...

18:31.857 --> 18:33.256
every week
since she's been gone.

18:33.326 --> 18:35.851
I've always known that one day

18:35.928 --> 18:38.726
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.

18:38.798 --> 18:40.698
I've never forgotten.

18:40.766 --> 18:43.132
These are all to your wife?

18:43.202 --> 18:45.261
How long has it been?

18:45.338 --> 18:47.738
My last letter...

18:50.009 --> 18:52.034
my last letter's not...

18:52.111 --> 18:54.102
it's not here.

18:54.180 --> 18:59.812
Oh, I wrote it three days ago,
butit's...is not...

18:59.885 --> 19:03.116
I can't let her think
I've stopped writing...

19:03.222 --> 19:08.182
that I gave up hope only,
only days before...

19:08.227 --> 19:11.355
Huh, I'll write it again.

19:17.169 --> 19:19.103
My hand...

19:19.171 --> 19:21.765
my hand shakes sometimes.

19:21.841 --> 19:23.331
You write it so it looks nice.

19:23.409 --> 19:27.709
I'm very sorry, I have to go
before the soldiers come.

19:27.780 --> 19:32.114
The last one...
the last one was about...

19:34.286 --> 19:37.585
My memory isn't very good.

19:37.690 --> 19:39.590
No, I remember.

19:39.658 --> 19:42.252
I went walking in the morning.

19:42.328 --> 19:46.321
It was...it was very cold.

19:46.399 --> 19:49.300
Tell her I wore my sweater.

19:49.368 --> 19:53.600
She worries
about that sort of...thing.

19:53.672 --> 19:58.541
And...and, uh...

19:58.611 --> 20:01.774
and I, uh, and I what?

20:04.116 --> 20:06.949
And I saw they had torn down
that old building

20:07.019 --> 20:10.819
where you and the other children
used to...to play.

20:10.890 --> 20:15.293
And, uh...what...?

20:15.361 --> 20:19.354
Tell her that it rained
for two and a half days.

20:19.432 --> 20:22.299
I don't know
if she can see the sky...

20:24.603 --> 20:26.503
where they're keeping her.

20:29.942 --> 20:33.378
And...there was more.

20:33.446 --> 20:38.975
There was something
about a friend...I...

20:39.051 --> 20:40.143
Why can't I remember?

20:40.219 --> 20:41.811
I wanted to tell her!

20:45.424 --> 20:49.360
ls all right.
She'll understand.

20:51.730 --> 20:55.291
Yes, yes, you're right.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.096
She will.

21:06.445 --> 21:09.437
Please let me come with you.

21:10.449 --> 21:13.509
I'm sorry;,
thas not possible.

21:13.586 --> 21:14.814
Check this one here!

21:15.788 --> 21:17.085
Is there another way out?

21:17.156 --> 21:18.453
Open up or else!

21:18.524 --> 21:20.424
There.

21:23.796 --> 21:25.354
Open the door!

21:25.431 --> 21:26.921
Open the door now!

21:26.999 --> 21:28.796
Break it down!

22:10.676 --> 22:12.610
This is a waste of time.

22:12.678 --> 22:14.077
We don't need him anyway.

22:14.146 --> 22:15.238
I need him.

22:15.314 --> 22:17.111
If he's a member
of the resistance,

22:17.182 --> 22:19.514
he may be able to help
me contact my ship.

22:22.154 --> 22:24.088
Monster!

22:28.961 --> 22:31.395
He's the one.
He took your mother.

22:31.463 --> 22:32.395
We have to...

22:32.464 --> 22:35.297
They want a fight.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.426
Don't give them one.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.368
What? I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.

22:44.443 --> 22:45.467
Please!

22:45.544 --> 22:46.511
Please...

22:47.212 --> 22:48.509
You look like a helpful citizen.

22:48.581 --> 22:49.513
So, tell me.

22:49.582 --> 22:52.142
You might have seen
some strangers

22:52.217 --> 22:54.447
who were in the marketplace
earlier today.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.988
No, sir.
No, I've seen no one.

22:57.056 --> 22:57.852
Please.

22:57.923 --> 22:58.890
You!

23:07.600 --> 23:10.228
I'm looking for someone,
a woman.

23:10.302 --> 23:12.327
I haven't seen any woman.

23:14.406 --> 23:17.102
There are two right over here.

23:17.176 --> 23:19.610
You see them, don't you?

23:19.678 --> 23:20.702
Yes.

23:20.779 --> 23:23.043
Maybe we should discuss
this elsewhere.

23:26.118 --> 23:27.608
Caylem...

23:30.022 --> 23:30.989
Good morning.

23:33.759 --> 23:35.522
I seem to have lost my hat.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.898
ls about this...this big.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.078
Have you seen my hat?

24:05.090 --> 24:06.785
Run along, old man.

24:06.859 --> 24:09.191
Without my hat?

24:20.139 --> 24:21.197
There you go.

24:48.834 --> 24:53.567
There...is...
is all right now.

24:53.639 --> 24:54.901
They've gone.

25:31.643 --> 25:34.077
The prison is in the northeast
corner of the city.

25:34.146 --> 25:35.078
My sources tell me

25:35.147 --> 25:38.014
is surrounded
by metaphasic shields.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.482
Can we find a way
to beam through them?

25:39.551 --> 25:41.781
The Mokra aren't familiar
with transporter technology.

25:41.854 --> 25:45.654
There is a periodic fluctuation
in the shielďs energy pattern.

25:45.758 --> 25:47.350
I'm working on a way
to take advantage of it.

25:47.426 --> 25:49.018
There's only one problem
with that.

25:49.094 --> 25:51.289
If the Mokra detect us
breaking through their shields,

25:51.363 --> 25:53.354
we'll be surrounded
by soldiers in seconds.

25:53.432 --> 25:54.990
If we could beam in
close enough

25:55.067 --> 25:56.967
to where the away team
is being held,

25:57.035 --> 25:58.059
we might be able to get
in and out of there

25:58.137 --> 25:59.968
before the Mokra
had a chance to react.

26:00.038 --> 26:02.438
We can't locate
the away team from here.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.509
The detention level
is subterranean

26:04.543 --> 26:07.740
and the rock is too dense
for our sensors to penetrate.

26:07.813 --> 26:10.373
You'll have to look for them
after you beam into the prison.

26:10.449 --> 26:11.541
Too dangerous.

26:11.617 --> 26:13.050
We can't risk beaming in.

26:13.118 --> 26:15.746
We'll have to find another way
that the Mokra won't detect.

26:15.821 --> 26:17.880
Sounds like a challenge
for you, Mr. Kim.

26:20.492 --> 26:21.959
You'd be welcome
to use our transmitter

26:22.027 --> 26:23.392
if we still had one.

26:23.462 --> 26:25.157
The Mokra confiscated
it this morning.

26:25.230 --> 26:26.697
Then I'll have to find
my crew members myself.

26:26.765 --> 26:28.528
I know two of them
were arrested.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.589
What about Neelix?

26:29.668 --> 26:30.566
He stayed inside with me,

26:30.636 --> 26:32.069
then got transported
up to your ship.

26:32.137 --> 26:34.799
Good. What can you tell me
about the prison?

26:34.873 --> 26:35.897
I know about the prison.

26:35.974 --> 26:37.373
We need all the information
we can get.

26:37.442 --> 26:38.534
I have to reach my crew.

26:38.610 --> 26:39.941
Don't you think there
are people in there

26:40.012 --> 26:41.001
I'd like to get out?

26:41.079 --> 26:42.876
Any sane person would
tell youit's impossible.

26:42.948 --> 26:44.745
Spoken like a coward.

26:44.817 --> 26:46.250
I've heard about you, old man.

26:46.318 --> 26:47.307
You're the coward!

26:47.386 --> 26:48.614
Enough.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.654
What are you doing
with this lunatic?

26:50.722 --> 26:52.917
Has he been telling you stories
of his brave deeds?

26:52.991 --> 26:53.980
They're just fantasies.

26:54.059 --> 26:55.026
Taking him along

26:55.093 --> 26:56.856
on this rescue mission
of yours is suicide.

26:56.929 --> 26:59.329
He's already saved me
from the Mokra once.

26:59.398 --> 27:01.923
And he saved you from
those soldiers today.

27:02.034 --> 27:03.365
All right, stay with him.

27:03.402 --> 27:05.370
Go off to the prison,
get yourself killed.

27:05.437 --> 27:08.167
I don't have to get killed
if you'll tell me what you know.

27:09.441 --> 27:10.999
There are access tunnels
on the north side.

27:11.076 --> 27:12.338
They'll get you in
a little closer,

27:12.411 --> 27:13.343
but they're guarded.

27:13.412 --> 27:14.504
Then I'll need weapons.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.343
They're not free.

27:16.415 --> 27:18.178
I don't have anything to trade.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.150
Thas worth some weapons.

27:20.219 --> 27:21.846
I can't.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.717
Yes, you can...

27:23.789 --> 27:26.690
if ill help
to bring her back to us.

27:26.758 --> 27:28.555
Thank you.

27:28.627 --> 27:30.891
I can have someone
meet you on the street

27:30.963 --> 27:32.760
in three hours
to make the trade.

27:32.831 --> 27:34.389
He'll be wearing a blue vest.

27:34.466 --> 27:35.455
Watch for him.

27:35.534 --> 27:37.468
We will. Thank you.

27:37.536 --> 27:39.094
I'd wish you luck,

27:39.171 --> 27:41.105
but what you'll need
is a miracle.

27:57.890 --> 28:00.381
He's more than three hours late.

28:00.459 --> 28:02.290
We have to consider
the possibility

28:02.361 --> 28:03.658
that he's been arrested.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.530
You mustn't believe
what he told you about me.

28:08.967 --> 28:10.525
I don't believe it.

28:10.602 --> 28:12.866
You're not a coward.

28:14.706 --> 28:16.264
I had to keep
my little girl safe.

28:16.341 --> 28:18.309
It was just too dangerous
to get involved.

28:18.377 --> 28:20.004
Can you understand?

28:20.078 --> 28:21.705
Your mother wouldn't listen.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.907
She wanted to fight.

28:23.982 --> 28:28.544
She was always...so passionate
about what she believed in.

28:28.654 --> 28:30.485
She didn't care about the risk.

28:31.957 --> 28:33.925
You were proud of her.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.955
I didn't want to lose her.

28:37.029 --> 28:40.294
I didn't want you to grow up
without a mother.

28:40.365 --> 28:43.960
I tried so hard
to change her mind

28:44.036 --> 28:46.368
and finally she changed mine.

28:46.438 --> 28:49.566
She convinced me to go with her.

28:50.909 --> 28:54.777
I said I would meet her...
by the river.

28:54.846 --> 28:59.146
She was leading a raid
against a Mokra supply center.

29:02.387 --> 29:04.048
I said I would meet her...

29:06.425 --> 29:08.723
but I didn't...I couldn't.

29:08.794 --> 29:10.227
I was too afraid.

29:14.399 --> 29:18.631
She was still waiting for me
when they arrested her.

29:18.704 --> 29:21.138
I could never tell you
about this.

29:21.206 --> 29:23.674
I knew you would hate me.

29:23.742 --> 29:25.539
I couldn't bear that.

29:25.610 --> 29:27.908
Please, Ralkana,
if you can ever forgive me...

29:34.353 --> 29:36.082
All right, I'll be right there.

29:46.098 --> 29:47.565
What is it?

29:47.632 --> 29:48.599
A blue vest.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.997
Thenit's time to go.

30:17.796 --> 30:19.661
What happened?

30:19.765 --> 30:22.757
He was wearing military boots
like the Mokra.

30:22.834 --> 30:23.766
It was a trap.

30:23.835 --> 30:25.427
A trap?
And you saw it?

30:25.504 --> 30:26.596
My clever girl.

30:26.671 --> 30:27.365
We'll be all right.

30:27.439 --> 30:28.371
We have each other.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.372
Thas all we'll need.

30:29.441 --> 30:30.430
ls not that simple.

30:30.509 --> 30:33.069
We can't just walk
into the prison without weapons.

30:42.254 --> 30:45.189
Maybe we'll have to try
a different strategy.

30:57.636 --> 31:00.503
We don't have to ask your friend
any more questions

31:00.572 --> 31:02.267
if you give us the answers.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.934
I told you, I don't...

31:19.391 --> 31:21.325
I'm sorry.

31:32.637 --> 31:35.299
I guess I...I always assumed

31:35.373 --> 31:40.208
that Vulcans didn't feel pain
like the rest of us;

31:40.278 --> 31:44.214
that you were able
to block it out somehow

31:44.282 --> 31:45.909
until I heard...

31:47.285 --> 31:49.048
Was that you I heard?

31:51.523 --> 31:55.516
Vulcans are capable
of suppressing

31:55.594 --> 31:59.189
certain levels of physical pain.

31:59.264 --> 32:05.931
Beyond that, we must simply
endure the experience.

32:06.037 --> 32:08.335
How can you say that so calmly?

32:08.373 --> 32:14.573
You must feel some anger
at what they did to you...

32:14.646 --> 32:16.614
some desire to fight back.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.414
Under the circumstances,

32:20.485 --> 32:23.921
physical resistance
is ineffective.

32:23.989 --> 32:28.790
We are...fighting back

32:28.860 --> 32:32.660
by refusing to give
them any information.

32:34.132 --> 32:35.326
Get down there!

32:47.612 --> 32:50.046
Three more hours.

32:51.216 --> 32:53.446
There's nothing
going on around here.

32:53.518 --> 32:55.577
Wake me if the Lieutenant
shows up, will you?

33:14.406 --> 33:17.898
You girls aren't supposed
to come down here anymore.

33:19.077 --> 33:20.635
Do you want me to leave?

33:25.483 --> 33:27.508
I didn't say that.

33:29.521 --> 33:32.012
Then I won't.

33:32.090 --> 33:35.059
If my Lieutenant saw you here,
I'd be in trouble.

33:36.394 --> 33:39.329
Nobody will see us back here.

33:40.899 --> 33:42.799
ls dark...

33:42.867 --> 33:44.232
private.

34:04.656 --> 34:06.021
I like this strategy.

34:24.442 --> 34:25.534
Ready to go?

34:25.610 --> 34:27.804
No...you're not coming with me.

34:27.879 --> 34:29.312
Of course I am.

34:29.380 --> 34:31.610
We settled this.

34:31.716 --> 34:34.184
You told that man, Darod,

34:34.252 --> 34:36.447
how I saved you from the Mokra!

34:36.521 --> 34:37.748
You did save me.

34:37.822 --> 34:39.516
Now I'm returning the favor.

34:43.295 --> 34:46.525
I promise I'll try
to find your wife.

34:48.967 --> 34:50.161
Wait!

34:50.235 --> 34:51.429
Ralkana!

34:51.503 --> 34:53.197
No!

34:57.609 --> 34:59.770
I've been studying
their orbital sensor net.

34:59.844 --> 35:01.334
It surrounds the entire planet.

35:01.446 --> 35:03.914
This is the most sophisticated
system I've ever seen.

35:03.948 --> 35:07.281
It monitors everything we do,
there's no way of disabling

35:07.352 --> 35:08.319
it from orbit.

35:08.386 --> 35:10.115
So much for a surprise attack.

35:10.188 --> 35:11.450
We may still be able
to surprise them

35:11.523 --> 35:12.547
even if they do see us coming.

35:12.624 --> 35:15.787
We could modify
the main deflector

35:15.860 --> 35:17.122
to send out dozens
of radion beams

35:17.195 --> 35:18.822
which should penetrate
the prison shields.

35:18.897 --> 35:20.797
One of them will carry
our transporter signal,

35:20.865 --> 35:24.301
but the sensor net won't be
able to distinguish which one,

35:24.369 --> 35:25.461
so the Mokra won't know

35:25.537 --> 35:27.300
the exact location
we're beaming to.

35:27.372 --> 35:29.340
And they won't know where
to concentrate their defenses.

35:29.407 --> 35:31.034
Thas the best head start
I can give you.

35:31.109 --> 35:32.041
Then ill have to do.

35:32.110 --> 35:34.374
How long will it take to modify
the deflector?

35:34.446 --> 35:35.879
I can do it right now.

35:35.947 --> 35:38.108
Chakotay to Paris.
Is the rescue team ready?

35:38.183 --> 35:39.115
Standing by.

35:39.184 --> 35:40.446
Prepare for transport.

35:40.518 --> 35:42.315
Deflector ready, Commander.

35:42.387 --> 35:43.979
Initiate the radion beams.

35:44.055 --> 35:45.886
Sending out the first volley...

35:45.957 --> 35:47.424
ls working.

35:47.492 --> 35:48.754
They're getting
through the shields.

35:48.827 --> 35:50.089
Begin the transport.

35:50.161 --> 35:51.492
Transporter Room 2,

35:51.563 --> 35:53.588
synchronize
your confinement beams to...

35:55.033 --> 35:56.432
That came from the surface.

35:56.501 --> 35:57.593
Maximum shields.

35:57.669 --> 35:58.465
Damage report.

35:58.536 --> 36:00.003
Shields at 90 percent.

36:00.071 --> 36:03.006
That was a precision hit right
to the source of the beams.

36:03.108 --> 36:05.474
Main deflector is now off-line.

36:06.478 --> 36:08.002
We're being hailed
from the surface.

36:08.079 --> 36:09.307
On screen.

36:11.015 --> 36:13.108
Your attempt
to penetrate our defenses

36:13.184 --> 36:16.347
is a hostile act
against the Mokra Order.

36:16.421 --> 36:19.049
There are now
85 phased- ion cannons

36:19.124 --> 36:20.751
targeted at your ship.

36:20.825 --> 36:24.158
If you don't withdraw
from Mokra space in two minutes,

36:24.229 --> 36:26.527
we will open fire.

37:34.766 --> 37:36.256
Commander.

37:36.334 --> 37:38.234
Give me some good news, Mr. Kim.

37:38.303 --> 37:40.601
There's a disruption in the
shields around the prison.

37:40.672 --> 37:42.105
That qualifies.
Good work.

37:42.173 --> 37:43.538
I wish I could take
credit for it,

37:43.608 --> 37:45.269
butit's coming
from inside the prison.

37:45.343 --> 37:46.332
Can we get through?

37:46.411 --> 37:49.244
Yes, but the Mokra
will detect our transport.

37:49.314 --> 37:51.373
Sounds like they have other
things to worry about right now.

37:51.449 --> 37:54.350
That disruption might
not be accidental.

37:54.419 --> 37:56.614
Someone in there might
be trying to get out.

37:56.688 --> 37:57.814
Thas a big assumption.

37:57.889 --> 38:00.790
Even if our people
didn't cause the problem,

38:00.859 --> 38:02.724
you know they'd take
advantage of it.

38:03.761 --> 38:05.922
This is our best chance
to find them.

38:05.997 --> 38:08.465
In about 30 seconds, the Mokra
are going to open fire.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.694
I don't know how long we'll
be able to wait for you.

38:10.768 --> 38:12.326
Understood.

38:22.614 --> 38:24.206
Darod.

38:26.451 --> 38:28.282
I'm looking for my people.

38:28.353 --> 38:29.684
Back this way.

38:29.754 --> 38:31.221
I'll show you.

38:58.316 --> 39:00.216
Don't move.

39:01.853 --> 39:02.820
There you are.

39:02.887 --> 39:04.218
What are you doing here?

39:04.289 --> 39:06.484
I would do everything
in my power

39:06.624 --> 39:08.819
to protect my only child.

39:14.098 --> 39:16.430
There's a phased- ion charge
coming at us from the planet.

39:16.501 --> 39:18.230
Full power to the shields.

39:18.303 --> 39:22.205
Shields at 60 percent.
Minor damage on Deck 14.

39:22.273 --> 39:23.740
They're firing again.

39:23.808 --> 39:24.775
Modulate the shield frequencies.

39:24.842 --> 39:26.002
Try to throw off their sensors.

39:30.315 --> 39:31.646
No effect.

39:31.716 --> 39:33.343
Direct hit to the port nacelle.

39:33.418 --> 39:35.318
Redirect all warp power
to the shields.

39:36.554 --> 39:38.078
Two more coming in.

39:44.929 --> 39:45.554
Captain.

39:47.599 --> 39:49.590
We've got to get you
back to the ship.

39:49.701 --> 39:50.759
You're hurt.

39:50.835 --> 39:53.201
Ralkana, the other cells
are this way.

39:53.271 --> 39:54.499
We must find your mother.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.175
Follow this passageway

39:58.242 --> 39:59.470
until it dead- ends.

39:59.544 --> 40:00.943
Then you'll see
a smaller passageway.

40:01.012 --> 40:02.536
Captain, what are you doing?

40:02.614 --> 40:04.775
There's one more person
I have to find.

40:04.849 --> 40:05.816
Guards!

40:10.888 --> 40:14.255
After all that time
I spent looking for you,

40:14.325 --> 40:17.192
all I had to do was wait here.

40:21.799 --> 40:22.857
Shields down to 23 percent.

40:22.934 --> 40:25.061
We've got to get out
of their weapons range.

40:25.136 --> 40:27.104
Scan one more time
for the away team.

40:28.072 --> 40:29.937
There's no sign of them.

40:31.409 --> 40:32.569
Prepare to break orbit.

40:33.811 --> 40:37.372
Wait! Set a course
bearing 219 mark 47.

40:37.448 --> 40:39.507
Where are you taking us,
Mr. Kim?

40:40.785 --> 40:43.253
There's a large electrical storm
over the northern magnetic pole.

40:43.321 --> 40:45.152
ls giving our sensors
some trouble.

40:45.223 --> 40:46.190
It should do the same
for theirs.

40:46.257 --> 40:48.191
- A blind spot.
- Exactly.

40:48.259 --> 40:50.659
If we maintain our position
directly above the storm,

40:50.728 --> 40:53.322
their sensor net may not be able
to keep an accurate lock

40:53.398 --> 40:54.330
on our position.

40:54.399 --> 40:55.331
How long do you think
this'll work?

40:55.400 --> 40:56.833
The storm's already dissipating.

40:56.901 --> 40:57.731
A few more minutes?

40:57.835 --> 40:59.268
I'll take every second
I can get.

41:00.938 --> 41:03.964
I must say I'm impressed,
Caylem.

41:04.042 --> 41:06.374
You never made it
this far before.

41:06.444 --> 41:10.608
Every so often, he goes on one
of his missions...

41:10.682 --> 41:13.480
to rescue his wife.

41:13.551 --> 41:15.883
She's been dead for 12 years.

41:15.953 --> 41:17.545
Lies.

41:17.622 --> 41:19.613
Lies...lies!

41:19.691 --> 41:23.457
Sometimes...he gets all
the way up to the front gate.

41:23.528 --> 41:25.894
We send him on his way

41:25.963 --> 41:28.056
and allow him
to serve as a reminder

41:28.132 --> 41:31.260
of just how futile it is
to challenge us.

41:31.335 --> 41:32.927
I thought
you'd learned that lesson

41:33.004 --> 41:34.335
when you lost your daughter.

41:34.405 --> 41:38.273
She made it as far as the
tunnels before she was shot.

41:38.342 --> 41:39.400
No!

41:39.477 --> 41:42.913
So much tragedy
for one man to bear...

41:42.980 --> 41:46.609
and now your foolishness
has condemned

41:46.684 --> 41:48.652
another innocent woman.

41:50.188 --> 41:51.985
Take the others back
for questioning.

41:52.056 --> 41:54.581
I'll interrogate this one
myself.

41:54.659 --> 41:56.286
No! I won't let you hurt her!

42:13.745 --> 42:15.235
Caylem!

42:33.164 --> 42:34.927
Ralkana...

42:37.034 --> 42:39.594
he said you'd been shot.

42:39.670 --> 42:43.970
He was lying to you, Father.

42:44.041 --> 42:45.668
I'm all right.

42:47.078 --> 42:48.773
And your mother?

42:48.846 --> 42:50.370
She's fine.

42:50.448 --> 42:53.474
She was so happy
to get your letters.

42:57.889 --> 43:00.289
She wanted me
to tell you something.

43:00.391 --> 43:02.621
She forgives you.

43:02.660 --> 43:05.026
We both do.

43:15.506 --> 43:17.770
My sweet girl.

43:38.563 --> 43:39.894
Captain.

43:41.699 --> 43:42.859
I'm coming.

43:54.245 --> 43:56.873
No one will forget
what he did here today.

43:56.948 --> 43:58.711
I'll make sure of that.

44:02.553 --> 44:04.043
Chakotay to Transporter Room 2.

44:04.121 --> 44:05.088
Do we have them?

44:05.156 --> 44:06.589
We're all back, Commander.

44:06.657 --> 44:07.589
Take us out of here.

44:07.692 --> 44:10.092
Gladly.

44:10.161 --> 44:11.628
Lieutenant, you heard her.

44:17.902 --> 44:20.166
The warp drive is
functioning normally,

44:20.238 --> 44:24.902
and we'll have the main
deflector back on line tomorrow.

44:26.744 --> 44:28.302
Yes, thank you, Mr. Kim.

44:29.313 --> 44:31.281
Captain, are you all right?

44:31.449 --> 44:32.473
I'm fine.
