00:21.523 --> 00:23.525
<i>Right now, it's about
55 degrees and cloudy,</i>

00:23.692 --> 00:25.568

00:28.947 --> 00:31.324
<i>Peace, Chicago. Let's do this!</i>

00:43.670 --> 00:44.713
<i>Dear Chicago,</i>

00:59.561 --> 01:01.604
<i>And of course, yours truly.</i>

01:01.813 --> 01:04.691
<i>But to me, you're much more than that.</i>

01:05.191 --> 01:07.235
<i>You're the place that raised me,</i>

01:07.402 --> 01:09.028
<i>the place I call home.</i>

01:09.195 --> 01:11.156
<i>And I'll never forget what you gave me.</i>

01:12.490 --> 01:14.159
<i>My first kiss,</i>

01:14.325 --> 01:16.703

<i>My first fight...</i>

01:22.667 --> 01:25.545
<i>And first ass-whooping
from Boobie Monroe.</i>

01:27.672 --> 01:31.009
<i>And of course, my first love,
my wife, Jennifer,</i>

01:31.426 --> 01:35.054
<i>who gave me the greatest gift
a man could ever ask for...</i>

01:35.221 --> 01:37.390
<i>My son, Jalen Palmer.</i>

01:44.647 --> 01:45.648
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:45.815 --> 01:47.817
You know how we do.
South Side Chicago, baby!

01:47.984 --> 01:50.111
South Side, baby.
Yes, sir, 79th Street all day.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.446
- Yes, sir.
- It don't stop.

01:51.613 --> 01:52.757
<i>I just wanna say thank you.</i>

01:52.781 --> 01:53.782
<i>For what?</i>

01:53.948 --> 01:55.108
For introducing me to Rashad.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.510
Ah, y'all gonna be divorced in a minute.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.036
Oh.

01:58.203 --> 02:00.079
No, I'm just playing with you.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.915
<i>Not to mention,</i>

02:02.081 --> 02:03.625
<i>lifelong friendship</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:05.752
<i>and family.</i>

02:07.337 --> 02:09.798
<i>And the birth of a new era.</i>

02:09.964 --> 02:12.383
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

02:12.634 --> 02:15.178
<i>So I hope you know
it's out of love that I say this.</i>

02:15.345 --> 02:16.346
<i>But recently,</i>

02:16.513 --> 02:18.890
<i>things ain't been the same
between me and you.</i>

02:20.475 --> 02:21.702
<i>Lately, you've been out of control.</i>

02:21.726 --> 02:23.895
<i>At least 24 people
were shot and injured.</i>

02:24.270 --> 02:26.731
<i>Police believe most shootings
were gang-related.</i>

02:26.898 --> 02:29.338
<i>And I'm not the only one
that feels this way, Chicago.</i>

02:29.567 --> 02:31.653
We've just gone to a new low.
When you now...

02:31.820 --> 02:33.380
<i>There used to be a day
when there was a code.</i>

02:33.404 --> 02:34.757
<i>You didn't kill children.
You didn't kill mothers.</i>

02:34.781 --> 02:37.534
<i>You didn't kill grandmothers.
There is no boundary.</i>

02:37.742 --> 02:39.577
Children are dying in the street.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.305
We have to stop the violence.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.705
<i>The streets are talking.</i>

02:43.248 --> 02:44.415
<i>They're tired.</i>

02:46.960 --> 02:48.795
<i>They're angry.</i>

02:58.263 --> 03:00.640
<i>WBBM news time, 6:32.</i>

03:00.807 --> 03:02.660
<i>Violence on Chicago's streets</i>

03:02.684 --> 03:04.769
<i>took no holiday for the long weekend.</i>

03:04.936 --> 03:06.938
<i>Police say at least
eight people were killed,</i>

03:07.146 --> 03:09.983
<i>at least 20 others wounded
in shootings since Thursday.</i>

03:10.149 --> 03:12.193
<i>That's an increase over
last year's holiday weekend</i>

03:12.360 --> 03:14.654
<i>that saw five killed and 14 wounded.</i>

03:15.113 --> 03:16.155
Oh, Lord.

03:16.739 --> 03:17.824
Hey, Eddie. What's up, man?

03:18.658 --> 03:20.577
Calvin, I messed up this time, man.

03:20.743 --> 03:21.887
I'm telling you. I did something wrong.

03:21.911 --> 03:22.912
What?

03:23.079 --> 03:25.432
There's a bunch of them Gangster Disciples
down there on the corner,

03:25.456 --> 03:26.851
with their pants hanging
all around their ankles.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.435
And I told them how they was a bunch
of conjugal visits gone bad.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.605
And they're coming down here.
They're coming after me, Calvin.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.047
- I need the strap!
- Strap?

03:33.298 --> 03:34.483
I need the heat! Where's the heater?

03:34.507 --> 03:35.587
Ain't no heat in here, man.

03:35.717 --> 03:36.837
The gun! The gat!

03:36.885 --> 03:38.165
There ain't no gun in this shop.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.637
So we ain't got no gun?

03:39.846 --> 03:41.366
They're about to come in here with AKs

03:41.431 --> 03:42.765
and 47s and Desert Eagles,

03:42.932 --> 03:45.518
and we got nothing but witch hazel!

03:46.227 --> 03:48.646
Eddie. Are you serious?
Because I don't see nobody.

03:48.855 --> 03:50.106
Here they come!

03:50.273 --> 03:51.316
- Where?
- Come on!

03:51.482 --> 03:53.526
Come on, Calvin! Come on!

03:53.985 --> 03:55.361
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

03:55.528 --> 03:57.030
Shit, man.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.465
What are we gonna do?

03:59.991 --> 04:02.327
You know what, I talked my way into this,

04:03.286 --> 04:04.513
maybe I can talk my way out of it.

04:04.537 --> 04:06.473
Man, we can go out the back.
Let's just go out the back!

04:06.497 --> 04:08.374
I can't run, Calvin. I'm old.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.019
- Let's go.
- I'm just gonna talk to them.

04:10.043 --> 04:11.312
They're young boys,
and I'm gonna talk to them.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.338
Listen, you're not going out there!

04:13.546 --> 04:15.006
Let me get something. Just wait.

04:15.173 --> 04:16.673
Calvin! Don't.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.887
There we go.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.680
<i>Let's be reasonable.</i>

04:22.889 --> 04:25.391
<i>Everybody just calm down.
Let me just talk to you.</i>

04:25.725 --> 04:27.685
<i>- Everybody stay cool-headed.</i>
- Shit.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.188
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
<i>- Just give me one of--</i>

04:30.355 --> 04:32.231
Leave that man alone! Black lives matter!

04:32.565 --> 04:34.192
He's old and decrepit!

04:36.694 --> 04:38.696
Pedro, <i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

04:39.155 --> 04:40.198
Eddie.

04:40.365 --> 04:41.366
You want some?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.117
- Man.
- I got you.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.869
I'm tired of this, Eddie.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.043
That sandwich was hand-crafted.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.714
<i>And you should have heard!</i>

04:56.965 --> 04:58.049
"Black lives matter!"

04:58.216 --> 05:00.216
"Eddie, don't go out there,
they're gonna kill ya!"

05:00.385 --> 05:02.971
He was quivering like
Terrence Howard at the Oscars.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.555
See, Eddie, that's your problem.

05:04.722 --> 05:05.932
You play too damn much, man.

05:06.099 --> 05:08.077
One day, somebody gonna be
chasing your ass for real.

05:08.101 --> 05:10.021
You know what I'mma do?
I'mma let them catch you.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.437
Oh, okay, okay.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.232
You know the rules, baby boy.

05:14.399 --> 05:15.692
If you like it, you pay.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.498
If you don't like it,
your ass pay anyway.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.070
Nice. Nice.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.492
Well, Isaac,

05:24.701 --> 05:26.703
it's good running into you again.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.951
Man, she know
she ain't never ran a day in her life.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.584
You gonna call me, right?

05:33.793 --> 05:35.211
Oh, uh-huh.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.421
You crazy.

05:36.629 --> 05:38.589
All right. Ow.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.174
Yes!

05:40.425 --> 05:42.265
All right, Soror.
Girl, I'll talk to you later.

05:42.427 --> 05:43.428
Bye.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.905
You know you my girl and--

05:44.929 --> 05:46.264
<i>All right, baby girl.</i>

05:46.597 --> 05:48.474
See you around.

05:48.808 --> 05:49.809
Damn!

05:50.101 --> 05:52.186
What happened to the barbershop, Calvin?

05:52.353 --> 05:54.033
I used to come here
to get away from women.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.442
Especially the ones I'll never ever
wanna see again as long as I live.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.069
You know you love the ladies,
especially the sisters.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.946
Yeah, it's true, I like the sisters. I do.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.448
Just not that one.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.780
But homegirl in a catsuit,
though, she could get it.

06:05.867 --> 06:06.868
What's good, ma?

06:07.035 --> 06:08.036
Not you, pa.

06:08.828 --> 06:10.788
What them
pockets do, little daddy?

06:10.955 --> 06:12.835
You can come over here
and frisk me if you like.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.926
Now, I'm gonna keep it
real here for a second.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.504
This was a male sanctuary.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.673
This is the original man cave.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.383
<i>And now, it's just a club,</i>

06:22.675 --> 06:24.469
with the lights on, and no drinks.

06:24.635 --> 06:25.803
Oh.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.430
Yo, Isaac. It is what it is, man.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.438
The recession ain't never
left the South Side.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.309
Joining forces saved us both.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.811
- Well, change is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.289
Everyone be well. Good seeing y'all.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.457
- I'll see you around again soon.
- Later.

06:36.481 --> 06:37.482
Bye.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.959
Peace. Good luck with everything.

06:38.983 --> 06:39.984
<i>Send me some pictures.</i>

06:40.151 --> 06:42.320
Guychat. Guybarber. Snapchat.

06:42.487 --> 06:44.739
Hit me up anytime you want.
I'mma see you later.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.365
He swear he cute.

06:46.616 --> 06:48.096
A'ight, don't get nothing on you now.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.471
<i>Look at him. He gonna chase her.</i>

06:50.495 --> 06:52.080
<i>Watch him. Watch him go.</i>

06:52.246 --> 06:53.498
Hey, Aisha!

06:53.664 --> 06:55.541
I told you!

06:56.542 --> 06:57.543
Y'all see that one?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.003
He like them big like that.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.588
Eddie, not cool.

07:00.755 --> 07:03.299
Go on back to your seat,
<i>Poetic Injustice.</i>

07:04.842 --> 07:06.002
- What up?
- What up, pimpin'?

07:06.052 --> 07:07.053
What up, G-ball?

07:07.220 --> 07:08.363
<i>What's hangin', Rashad?</i>

07:08.387 --> 07:09.680
What up, J, Bree, Angie?

07:09.847 --> 07:10.991
- Hey, Rashad.
- Morning, Rashad.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.201
- Hey, yo, boy.
- Cal, what up?

07:12.225 --> 07:13.452
- What's up with you, man?
- You good?

07:13.476 --> 07:14.516
- Good, I'm good.
- A'ight.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.686
<i>Seriously.</i>

07:15.853 --> 07:17.122
Your girl does need to be careful

07:17.146 --> 07:19.357
wearing all of that
red and gold down 79th.

07:19.524 --> 07:21.400
Yeah, man. The Vice Lords don't play that.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.962
You can't just wear their colors
and walk down the street unchecked.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.780
Man, the streets is crazy right now.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.448
I damn near got robbed the other day.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.866
I did get robbed the other day.

07:29.033 --> 07:32.370
What? Man, I got robbed twice
on the same day on the same block.

07:32.662 --> 07:33.996
That ain't shit.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.040
Last week, I got robbed twice

07:36.207 --> 07:38.376
and got my ass beat by the second robber

07:38.543 --> 07:40.169
for giving all my money to the first.

07:41.337 --> 07:42.380
She wasn't playing.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.049
I've been living on
the South Side since '52.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.844
I've been robbed,
been shot, been stabbed.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.887
Hell, been stoned, been groped,

07:50.263 --> 07:51.514
and almost lynched twice.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.683
Nobody tried to lynch your musty ass.

07:53.850 --> 07:56.561
The only reason I'm still here
is because the first time,

07:56.727 --> 07:58.207
they didn't know how to tie the knot.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.939
So I just slipped right out.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.482
<i>And second time,</i>

08:01.649 --> 08:03.401
the tree was too short.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.406
Hey, Calvin, I finished reorganizing
that supply closet.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.883
You want me to sweep before I go?

08:09.907 --> 08:10.950
- No, man.
- You sure?

08:11.117 --> 08:12.451
No. No, go on ahead to school.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.453
- You sure, man?
- Yeah, man, positive.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.181
- Here you go.
- Man, I appreciate that for sure.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.248
I appreciate it, too.

08:17.582 --> 08:19.268
- I'm gonna see you again next week.
- Okay.

08:19.292 --> 08:20.894
- Take care, Angie.
<i>- You be careful out there.</i>

08:20.918 --> 08:22.503
- Bye, Anthony.
- All right, y'all.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.670
- All right, man. Thanks!
- All right, Chris Beige.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.882
Now, don't get robbed.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.049
Oh, you a trip.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.456
<i>Rashad, your son's here!</i>

08:28.593 --> 08:30.033
Hey, what up, everybody? Hey, Angie.

08:30.136 --> 08:31.488
<i>There you go, double trouble.</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:32.832
- What's up, Eddie?
- Good.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.450
Hey, what's up, Dad? How's everything?

08:35.099 --> 08:37.434
Pretty good.
Shouldn't you two be at school by now?

08:37.602 --> 08:38.852
Yeah, we on our way.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.860
I just stopped by because
I need to borrow $20.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.232
Dad, come on, I need it.

08:43.441 --> 08:44.442
Angie, you got 20 bucks?

08:44.609 --> 08:45.610
Oh, yeah, I got 20.

08:45.776 --> 08:49.071
- Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?
- Yes, sir. What up, son?

08:49.238 --> 08:51.032
Does everybody in here that's working...

08:51.199 --> 08:52.283
What up, Dad?

08:52.450 --> 08:53.927
...got at least $20
in their pocket or purse?

08:53.951 --> 08:56.037
- Yeah, I do.
- Indeed, I do.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.748
Uh, I had $20, but I got robbed.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.476
That was serious, I ain't make that up.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.668
That bitch was swole.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.254
Not now, Dante. Not now.

09:05.922 --> 09:07.802
Do you know what all these
people got in common?

09:07.965 --> 09:09.050
They old?

09:09.967 --> 09:11.302
- Hold on now.
- Hey!

09:11.469 --> 09:12.470
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

09:12.637 --> 09:14.781
You know, you ain't too grown
to get your butt whooped.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.766
Cal, you want me to take
care of this for you?

09:16.933 --> 09:18.643
- No, I got this.
- Okay.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.810
Relax, Adrian Peterson.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.646
It's 2016, not 1816.

09:21.812 --> 09:25.024
You can't pull kids pants down and spank
their bottoms until it turns red.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.609
It's illegal and a little creepy.

09:26.776 --> 09:28.754
Ain't nobody talking
about that Catholic school you went to.

09:28.778 --> 09:30.488
Do I look like Father Flanagan?

09:30.988 --> 09:33.407
When I was growing up,
ass whippings were like meals,

09:33.574 --> 09:35.743
<i>- and I was well-fed.
- Hey, Kenny.</i>

09:35.910 --> 09:38.162
So, can we maybe get back to the $20?

09:38.329 --> 09:39.806
Whatever happened to you coming around

09:39.830 --> 09:41.832
after school every now and then
and helping out?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.603
Dad, come on. You know
I'm busy with homework and basketball.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.836
We've been busy with work.

09:46.254 --> 09:47.797
<i>It's a simple equation, son.</i>

09:48.005 --> 09:50.841
<i>You don't work, you don't get paid. Okay?</i>

09:51.008 --> 09:53.728
This ain't <i>The Oprah Show.</i>
You don't just show up and get free gifts.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.680
A'ight.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.158
And I better not find out that
you're late to that school.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.684
Told you, man.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.851
Hey, Kenny.

10:02.061 --> 10:03.062
I seen that.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.355
<i>- Put it back.
- Wow.</i>

10:04.522 --> 10:05.523
<i>I saw you, Kenny.</i>

10:05.690 --> 10:08.442
Those candy bars
are a dollar apiece, if you want one.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.652
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

10:09.819 --> 10:13.281
If not, I'mma assume you took 50
and I'm taking it out your pop's paycheck.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.949
And he don't make that much.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.827
Not to put your business out there,
but Terri does make more.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.371
Put it back.

10:20.746 --> 10:21.747
<i>Busted!</i>

10:22.373 --> 10:24.166
Everybody, check your wallets.

10:25.126 --> 10:26.377
<i>He got sticky fingers.</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:29.505
- Y'all have a blessed day.
- Shut up!

10:29.672 --> 10:30.840
<i>"Have a blessed day"?</i>

10:31.007 --> 10:32.675
He said, "Have a blessed day."

10:33.759 --> 10:36.262
I mean, why your dad's
gotta be so stingy?

10:36.429 --> 10:39.056
Thinking he teaching lessons
and dropping knowledge.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.058
That shit is annoying.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.476
For real, bro.

10:42.935 --> 10:43.936
Him and your dad,

10:44.103 --> 10:46.272
always talkin' out
the sides of their face.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.899
Talking about how they repping 79th,

10:49.066 --> 10:51.193
all that nonsense,
South Side, all that stupid shit.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.403
Stupid shit.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.617
What's up, G?

10:59.368 --> 11:00.578
What size is them Jordans?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.247
They my size. That's what size they are.

11:03.414 --> 11:04.832
You think you got heart, huh?

11:05.166 --> 11:07.352
Well, guess what, little nigga.
Hearts ain't bulletproof.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.812
Hey, why don't y'all just keep moving?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.230
Y'all out of your neighborhood anyway.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.454
Nigga, what you talking about?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.483
Y'all know our crew
run this whole neighborhood.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.800
We run this whole shit.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.802
Hey, yo, shorty, run them kicks.

11:17.762 --> 11:19.722
Man, y'all niggas ain't shit.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.391
Yeah, I said it.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.852
Nigga, this our block. You know that.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.897
Unless you really wanna do it.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.154
We out.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.281
All right.

11:37.448 --> 11:38.488
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:41.118
Yeah, keep it pushing.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.455
Get out of here, man.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.251
<i>Bitch-ass nigga.</i>

11:50.127 --> 11:51.337
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

11:51.504 --> 11:52.546
Ain't nothing.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.423
What's up, J?

11:54.590 --> 11:56.050
Heard you balled out this season.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.677
Hey, you know, trying to do my thing.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.606
Man, Coach already talking about
bumpin' him up to varsity next year.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.808
Word? That's good, man.
Keep putting in work.

12:04.058 --> 12:05.702
<i>You know, that's how you
get to the big leagues,</i>

12:05.726 --> 12:07.144
<i>like D-Rose and D-Wade.</i>

12:07.353 --> 12:09.033
Y'all need anything though?
Y'all straight?

12:10.356 --> 12:11.357
We cool.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.015
I got somethin' for y'all, man.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.195
I know how it be, being a little homie.
You know?

12:16.362 --> 12:18.239
I know y'all cool, be cooler.

12:18.406 --> 12:19.824
Ben Frank style.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.159
Gotta keep the little homies fresh,
you feel me?

12:22.326 --> 12:23.702
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.704
Y'all gonna be family soon anyway, right?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.540
- Fo' sho?
- Yeah.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.625
There's a lot more where that came from.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.752
- So get used to it.
- All right, Yummy.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.046
- I'll holler at you, J.
- All right.

12:35.381 --> 12:36.465
Yo!

12:37.299 --> 12:38.443
Girl, keep the change.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.177
- You like it?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

12:41.512 --> 12:43.764
Damn, I see you
getting that chop over there, girl.

12:43.931 --> 12:44.932
Yes, I am.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.539
How much you charge for them weaves?

12:46.684 --> 12:49.562
Well, it depends.
'Cause if you wanna be basic-ass

12:49.728 --> 12:51.730
<i>No, No, No</i> Destiny's Child Beyoncé,

12:52.148 --> 12:53.732
that's gonna cost you, like, $200.

12:53.983 --> 12:55.943
If you wanna be like,
you know, <i>Cater 2 U</i> Beyoncé,

12:56.026 --> 12:57.403
that's gonna cost you, like, $600.

12:57.736 --> 13:01.031
And if you wanna be
Beyoncé featuring Jay Z...

13:01.198 --> 13:03.659
- Boom, boom.
- Mmm.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.536
That's gonna cost you, like, a stack.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.581
I can't believe y'all
spend all that money on weaves anyway.

13:09.165 --> 13:10.685
Next thing you know, you gonna be just

13:10.749 --> 13:13.794
high-jacking and robbing
Puerto Ricans for their hair.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.524
Eddie, the only hair
getting stolen around here is Indian hair.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.048
It's lush, it's beautiful,

13:18.215 --> 13:20.593
and it's infused with coconut oil
right out the womb, okay?

13:20.926 --> 13:22.178
<i>That's why all y'all want it.</i>

13:22.344 --> 13:25.389
Man, I can't believe
y'all put all that money on your heads,

13:25.556 --> 13:27.683
and then don't be having
no money for your rent.

13:27.892 --> 13:30.102
Excuse you, this is how I pay my rent.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.645
Exactly.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.023
'Cause with this hair and this booty,

13:34.190 --> 13:36.025
it's like walking around
with a black AmEx.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.073
And I never get denied.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.695
I bet you don't.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.906
Y'all in here complaining
about our weaves,

13:42.114 --> 13:43.554
but y'all negroes know good and well

13:43.657 --> 13:46.911
that you'd drop-kick Lupita
to get to Kim Kardashian.

13:47.161 --> 13:48.746
- Even the non-negroes.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.456
Oh, especially the non...

13:52.124 --> 13:53.250
Can I say negroes?

13:53.501 --> 13:55.002
Carefully, very carefully.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.338
Say it slow so we can
hear all the syllables.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.589
Mmm-hmm.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.197
Just be remorseful when you say it.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.092
Cool. Negroes.

14:03.052 --> 14:05.262
As the only non-negro
in the room, I'd like to say,

14:05.429 --> 14:08.182
Lupita's got a Dark Caesar,
and it's one of my most requested cuts.

14:08.349 --> 14:09.391
<i>Lupita?</i>

14:09.558 --> 14:12.394
Man, don't nobody want
no bald head chick in real life.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.606
Even Kanye got rid of Amber
for Kim's sexy ass.

14:15.773 --> 14:19.401
Every day, y'all in here complaining
about fake weaves and fake asses,

14:19.568 --> 14:22.321
but all the girls that
you like on Instagram have exactly that.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.490
Fake weaves and fake asses.

14:24.657 --> 14:26.283
- No offense, Draya.
- None taken, girl.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.910
We winning and y'all ain't.

14:28.077 --> 14:30.397
I mean, but that's what dudes want,
they want that fantasy.

14:30.496 --> 14:33.457
Yeah, a fantasy that you still expect us
real women to live up to.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.519
What? Men are visual, all right?
What's the problem?

14:35.543 --> 14:36.544
Oh, and women aren't?

14:36.710 --> 14:39.964
I mean, you don't think we want some nice,
thick, sexy lips to suck on,

14:40.130 --> 14:42.466
and some nice big broad shoulders,

14:42.633 --> 14:46.303
and a dick print that
you can see from here to the Sears Tower?

14:46.720 --> 14:47.880
Preach.

14:48.556 --> 14:49.557
Mmm.

14:49.807 --> 14:52.476
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Hey! The language!</i>

14:52.726 --> 14:54.566
Watch your mouth in here.
Angie, get your girl.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.313
Oh. Sorry, Mr. Cal.

14:56.522 --> 14:59.733
You know what the
whole problem with your generation is?

14:59.984 --> 15:02.695
You don't know how to do nothing,
need to learn a skill.

15:02.945 --> 15:03.946
Learn how to mop a floor.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.156
You know what I'm saying? Iron.

15:06.407 --> 15:09.493
Your phone die,
you wouldn't know how to spell a sentence.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.289
Smart phone, dumb girls!

15:13.497 --> 15:16.250
Learn how to cook a decent meal,
for goodness' sake.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.752
Look, some of them
don't even know how to microwave.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.796
Had a girl come over
to my house last week,

15:20.963 --> 15:23.007
went into my kitchen,
thought mine was a safe.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.010
I bet that shit was empty.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.511
Ooh.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.471
And I can't believe you, Eddie.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.141
I can't believe that you
expect your visual fantasy

15:32.308 --> 15:36.020
to actually mop and iron
for your old ass?

15:36.186 --> 15:39.523
You come over to my house,
you better know how to clean and iron.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.692
Only thing gonna be
wrinkling around my house

15:41.859 --> 15:44.945
is my forehead when I say,
"Bitch, what?"

15:47.156 --> 15:48.449
You need manners.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.438
<i>- Yeah, Angie.
- Please!</i>

15:50.576 --> 15:55.122
It doesn't matter how much a woman tries
to live up to your fantasies.

15:55.414 --> 15:59.710
Doesn't matter if a woman tries to wash
your crusty-ass drawers every night.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.880
Doesn't matter if she
fixes him a special batch of vegan chili,

16:03.047 --> 16:05.674
even though chili
is supposed to have meat in it!

16:05.841 --> 16:08.385
<i>Everybody knows that chili has meat in it!</i>

16:08.552 --> 16:10.032
That's what it is, it doesn't matter,

16:10.179 --> 16:11.531
because he's still gonna
wake up one morning

16:11.555 --> 16:13.557
and leave your ass
for some chick on Instagram!

16:14.683 --> 16:17.353
Who had sex with you
and didn't appreciate it?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.938
Vegan chili is delicious.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.690
Trust me on this, ladies.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.897
The only man that you can
trust is the one up above.

16:23.942 --> 16:24.985
<i>Come on, Bree.</i>

16:25.194 --> 16:26.874
That dude, Ronnie,
he was just a bad apple.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.912
<i>If you and your man
had something real,</i>

16:29.031 --> 16:31.909
it wouldn't have mattered
how bad the Instagram ho was.

16:32.076 --> 16:34.036
She wouldn't have
been able to come between y'all.

16:34.078 --> 16:36.246
Not even for Jamaicanthickthighs24?

16:36.413 --> 16:37.998
Jerrod.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.848
Ass so fat you can see it from the front.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.294
- Let me see.
- Send me that.

16:42.461 --> 16:43.938
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh, there is a God.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.756
- Smell that.
- It's not scratch-and-sniff.

16:45.923 --> 16:47.299
<i>Ass cheeks so separated...</i>

16:47.549 --> 16:48.634
You know what, ladies?

16:48.884 --> 16:50.719
For years it has been a war,

16:50.928 --> 16:52.429
with the good girls and the hoes,

16:52.596 --> 16:54.431
and the hoes have officially won.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.809
Go, hoes!

16:57.101 --> 16:58.894
Love me some hoes.
I can't live without hoes.

16:59.103 --> 17:00.104
I gotta have them.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.941
Hoes know what to do
and when to do it!

17:04.108 --> 17:05.608
<i>Wait. Wait. Hold up!</i>

17:05.818 --> 17:08.987
You girls keep complaining
about the chauvinistic talk in the shop,

17:09.154 --> 17:11.281
but y'all do the same thing in reverse.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.742
Each one of y'all want a super thug

17:13.951 --> 17:16.619
that can hold his own
on the yard at the Cook County jail,

17:16.787 --> 17:19.707
that's got three degrees from
Harvard and making six figures.

17:19.873 --> 17:20.874
You know it.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.502
Meanwhile, you pass up
corny dudes like Jerrod every day.

17:23.711 --> 17:25.253
<i>Mmm. Exactly.</i>

17:25.421 --> 17:29.216
Don't no woman want no moist
Duncan Hines-ass dude like Jerrod.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.052
- No.
- Jerrod's like boiled okra.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.887
He's just green, stringy,

17:34.054 --> 17:36.432
just completely unappetizing
to the human palate.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.808
<i>Wow.</i>

17:37.975 --> 17:39.577
Such kind words, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.686
<i>Uh. A couple things.</i>

17:40.853 --> 17:43.313
First of all, I'm standing right here.
I can hear you.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.690
And second of all--

17:44.898 --> 17:45.941
Baller alert!

17:46.150 --> 17:47.961
<i>No, he did not just pull up
in a Maserati, girl!</i>

17:47.985 --> 17:49.987
<i>Is that L. Rock from the Bears?
Oh, my God.</i>

17:50.154 --> 17:52.531
<i>He just got a $47 million contract.</i>

17:52.698 --> 17:55.784
Thirty-five guaranteed
and four with incentives.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.764
Craig came by here 20 minutes ago
looking for you.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.108
Okay, thanks, Cal. I'll text him.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.166
Hey, babe.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.227
I need you to pick up Maya
from school today, too.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.938
I just squeezed in another
last-minute appointment and I can't do it.

18:06.962 --> 18:07.963
Yeah, I see.

18:08.464 --> 18:09.506
Come on, babe, please.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.300
I got an appointment, too.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.218
- Can't Kenny do it?
- I asked Kenny.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.225
He said he was too busy,
which is really funny,

18:15.304 --> 18:17.323
because I don't know
what a 15-year-old could be busy doing

18:17.347 --> 18:20.350
other than drinking up all my goddamn
apple juice and dirtying up the house.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.269
Oh, that's easy, they masturbate a lot.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.604
<i>What? They do.</i>

18:24.104 --> 18:25.355
I mean, I was 15.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.816
I was 15 this morning. Am I right, Raja?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.111
Don't touch me with that hand.
Don't touch me in general.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.905
Come here, let me get your beard.

18:33.447 --> 18:34.698
<i>That's all? Whoa. Really?</i>

18:34.865 --> 18:37.868
So you playing celebrity barber
and I'm Mr. Mom now?

18:38.035 --> 18:40.722
You're the one who said you wanted to
spend more time with Maya and Kenny,

18:40.746 --> 18:42.140
- so what's the problem?
- Some time.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.832
Half your clients was mine to start.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.239
<i>Oh, you complaining now?</i>

18:45.375 --> 18:48.229
When Kenny's mom asked if he can spend
the remainder of high school with us,

18:48.253 --> 18:49.254
I was cool with it.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.524
But since he's been with us,
he's done nothing to help out.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.549
Yeah, come on.

18:52.716 --> 18:53.943
It's like we have
two toddlers in the house.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.967
- It's a new situation.
- It's not a new situation.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.864
It's been a year!
You're being too soft on him!

18:57.888 --> 18:59.032
You know how long he was with his mother.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.867
<i>- I understand that.
- All right, y'all.</i>

19:00.891 --> 19:02.971
Yo, Terri and Rashad! Yo!

19:03.227 --> 19:05.038
Do y'all need a minute?
Because we'll all leave.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.772
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.107
It's like <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> reunion in here.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.359
<i>Momma Dee and Lil Scrappy.</i>

19:10.526 --> 19:12.402
Terri, girl, I couldn't help but overhear.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.446
I mean, girl, everybody could hear.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.865
But I wanted to tell you,
and I told Rashad,

19:17.407 --> 19:20.285
I could pick up Maya, like,
whenever you need me to.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.246
So let me know if I can help out, girl.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.790
In any... In any way.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.393
<i>I don't need nothing
but for you to back up a few feet.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:29.753
This is a private discussion
between me and my husband.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.272
I mean, I didn't realize
it was so private

19:31.296 --> 19:33.096
'cause, like I said,
everybody can hear y'all.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.175
But y'all been a little bit overwhelmed,

19:35.342 --> 19:38.428
and let me release some of that stress.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.266
Why don't you help yourself
back to your station, Draya?

19:42.432 --> 19:44.893
Look, Terri. I got you.
I got you, baby. Come here.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.311
My bad, girl.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.118
Don't even get riled up like that, Terri.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.749
- It's all good.
- Stay in your lane.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.942
Come on. Baby, come here, I got you.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.236
I'll go get Maya,
you do what you gotta do.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.643
I know we need the money, so...

19:55.904 --> 19:56.905
Thank you.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.825
Well, you know, when I get home later,

20:00.409 --> 20:01.785
I'll make it up to you.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.287
I'll do that thing you like.

20:03.537 --> 20:04.872
Yeah, okay.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.999
Sure you gonna be burnt out by tonight.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.211
It's all right, though. I'll wait for
the morning for that lazy side booty.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.676
Terri, just out of curiosity,
what is that thing that you do?

20:17.843 --> 20:19.203
Is it something that I can Google?

20:19.303 --> 20:21.471
<i>Yo, Calvin, what's the Wi-Fi password?</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:24.474
Let me get that Lupita.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.562
Excellent choice.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.631
<i>You wanna act grown?</i>

20:30.731 --> 20:32.524
Well, now you got a grown-man haircut.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.736
- Yeah, this gotta be some of my best work.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

20:39.197 --> 20:41.909
- Your friends at school gonna love this.
- Oh!

20:42.117 --> 20:44.661
That's the information
super highway right there.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.163
Let's go.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.248
So you learned your
lesson today, didn't you?

20:48.415 --> 20:51.168
You look good, man!
Nothin' can stop you now.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.837
Tell Weezy I said "hey!"

20:54.212 --> 20:55.255
Eddie...

20:55.422 --> 20:56.715
Tell me that ain't child abuse.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.843
I bet you he won't
be talking back to his mama no more.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.512
Gave him the George Jefferson.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.099
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

21:06.600 --> 21:08.226
Hi. Who are you here to see?

21:08.644 --> 21:09.884
Yeah, I'm here to see One-Stop.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.438
Take a number.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.649
They all here to see One-Stop.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.859
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.195
Right, right.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.906
That's what I said.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.199
Give me a minute, brother.

21:22.366 --> 21:25.118
I need eight 32-inch TVs. No plasma, man.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.925
Just LCDs, brother. You know what I mean?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.747
<i>I got the watches, I got the rings.</i>

21:28.914 --> 21:29.915
I'm doing tailoring,

21:30.082 --> 21:31.476
I'm doing a little bit
of everything now, brother.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.644
<i>Right, right, right, right.</i>

21:32.668 --> 21:33.853
No, I just do the measurements.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.957
I got a little Asian lady
who puts the suit together.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.381
<i>She sews. I don't sew.</i>

21:39.091 --> 21:42.469
Calvin, you really just gonna
let this fool come slidin' up in here

21:42.678 --> 21:44.262
<i>like he run the place?</i>

21:44.554 --> 21:46.556
Eddie, worry about your section.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.893
<i>Pardon me.</i>

21:50.102 --> 21:51.937
Look here, Truck Stop, One-Stop.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.064
Come here, son. This the barber shop.

21:54.231 --> 21:57.025
You gotta get people in and out.
That's what we do.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.820
You got these musty negroes
sitting around here all day,

21:59.987 --> 22:01.405
like it's an unemployment office.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.574
Hey, Eddie, man, look. I pay booth rent
like everybody else does in here.

22:04.741 --> 22:05.742
Besides,

22:05.909 --> 22:08.412
barbers don't provide the full
menu of services that I do.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.622
Off-market medicinal remedies,

22:10.789 --> 22:12.624
alternative documentation,

22:12.791 --> 22:14.751
little emotional service doggies

22:14.918 --> 22:17.063
that lick your face
and make you feel good about yourself.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.898
And they tinkle all over your shirt.

22:18.922 --> 22:21.550
They so happy to see you.
And it makes you feel good inside.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.719
I've been around a long time here, son.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.888
And what all you do is sell fake ID,

22:27.055 --> 22:29.307
nickel bags of weed,
and pit bull puppies.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.786
Talking about a little puppy
gonna lick on somebody's face.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.020
It sounds too freaky for me.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.626
I don't want no puppy licking on me.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.565
It's just not at all African-American.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.525
Sounds very, very Caucasian.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.319
Calvin, you really gonna
let him be up in the shop?

22:41.486 --> 22:43.206
Like, I can't believe
he let you up in here.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.324
Calvin, my man. You're my man, right?

22:46.658 --> 22:49.286
Please tell this man, this ancient being,

22:49.453 --> 22:50.746
this old fogey,

22:50.912 --> 22:52.456
this dinosaur of some sorts.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.623
Oh, keep them coming.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.126
This negro-saurus of a man
walking around here giving us

22:56.293 --> 22:58.879
the damn trailer to <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
every time we walk up in here.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.900
Okay, that was a good one right there.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.594
Please tell this
<i>50 Shades of Grey-</i> looking ass,

23:05.761 --> 23:07.971
am I or am I not

23:08.138 --> 23:10.432
a intricate part of this damn shop?

23:11.266 --> 23:12.309
He got a point, Eddie.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.019
He got...

23:14.227 --> 23:16.938
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.525
You know what? That's it for me.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.092
Hey. But this ain't no free clinic.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.072
I understand. And I did stop doing
the VD screenings last week.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.824
It's done, okay? It's over.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.606
What can I do for you, brother?

23:29.826 --> 23:31.328
Uh. I got a itch

23:31.745 --> 23:32.746
down there.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.122
<i>It's a itch that burns.</i>

23:34.289 --> 23:36.666
Come over here. This is the last one.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.557
<i>This boy burning bad,
I smell it. Come on.</i>

23:38.710 --> 23:40.629
- Hey, everybody!
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

23:40.796 --> 23:42.506
Rashad, I got your sheen spray for you.

23:42.756 --> 23:43.757
<i>Appreciate that.</i>

23:43.924 --> 23:46.635
Angie, this conditioner
should last you for the next two weeks.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.011
<i>Thank you, baby!</i>

23:48.345 --> 23:49.947
Can you help me put
these away in the back?

23:49.971 --> 23:52.516
<i>Hey, who's winning
over here, now? What's goin' on?</i>

23:54.601 --> 23:56.353
By a show of hands, who got a itch?

23:56.645 --> 23:57.854
Who got a burn?

23:58.021 --> 23:59.147
Damn.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.025
<i>So, did you hear
Mr. Harris got shot?</i>

24:02.234 --> 24:03.652
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.114
Are you serious? Is he okay?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.951
I mean, he got shot, so he's not great.

24:11.118 --> 24:12.119
But he's gonna make it.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.370
Oh, no.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.581
I was just in there last week
talking to his wife.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.877
Man. She was so excited
they was getting a second location.

24:21.837 --> 24:22.838
Was she with him?

24:23.004 --> 24:24.381
No, thank God.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.901
You know, he was in there by himself
closing up for the night.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.511
Wouldn't open up the register,
so they shot him.

24:30.178 --> 24:32.305
I don't know what's
happening out there, Calvin.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.307
These kids have lost their damn minds.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.893
Meanwhile, we gotta
raise Jalen in this mess.

24:37.644 --> 24:38.895
It's not cool.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.607
We gotta revisit that conversation.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.068
What conversation?

24:45.986 --> 24:47.445
About moving the shop.

24:48.071 --> 24:51.408
You know, One-Stop found some cool
locations over there on the North Side.

24:51.575 --> 24:54.494
Does One-Stop even know what escrow means?

24:54.661 --> 24:56.413
You'd be surprised what One-Stop know.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.707
And have you discussed it with Angie?

24:58.915 --> 25:02.252
You can't make a decision about the shop
without at least talking to her first.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.273
I wanted to talk to you first because you
know what you're gonna tell me?

25:05.297 --> 25:06.816
"Why did you talk to her first?"

25:06.840 --> 25:08.258
I do not sound like that.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.888
I don't know, Calvin.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.599
Uprooting the shop is a big decision.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.976
You don't think I know that?

25:18.810 --> 25:20.145
But what else we supposed to do?

25:20.312 --> 25:22.152
Just sit here and wait
for somethin' to happen?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.359
We gotta explore all of our options.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.738
Yeah.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.657
<i>I ain't got no money.</i>

25:38.705 --> 25:39.745
<i>Let me talk to you.</i>

25:39.873 --> 25:42.042
<i>- No, I'm good.
- Come on, baby.</i>

25:42.209 --> 25:43.352
<i>Let's holler at you for a little bit.</i>

25:43.376 --> 25:44.520
<i>You hollerin' right now,</i>

25:44.544 --> 25:45.629
<i>I can hear you. I'm good.</i>

25:45.795 --> 25:46.880
<i>Yo, who that?</i>

25:47.047 --> 25:48.298
<i>Hey, what up, J.D.?</i>

25:48.465 --> 25:49.466
Oh, hey!

25:49.633 --> 25:51.843
Hey, I got that tater salad for your mama!

25:52.010 --> 25:53.330
- Come get it!
<i>- All right.</i>

25:54.638 --> 25:56.139
What's going on, hungry black folks?

25:56.348 --> 25:58.850
Huh? Who wants some
non-profit Gangsta Grub?

25:59.017 --> 26:02.020
All right. Soul food to save fools' souls.

26:02.187 --> 26:05.065
Every delicious piece of beef
helps keep a bullet off the street.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.210
I know that's right because
that "Who Smoked Your Okra"

26:07.234 --> 26:08.652
was poppin' on fleek last time.

26:08.818 --> 26:09.903
There you go, Draya.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.613
Did she just say "fleek"?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.323
<i>Don't... Don't just make up words.</i>

26:13.490 --> 26:15.784
There's a whole dictionary full of words.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.494
<i>There's a library down the street.</i>

26:17.702 --> 26:19.996
Webster's Dictionary.
Go in there and flip through it.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.290
You won't see "fleek" in there, nowhere.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.060
Draya, don't worry about that. I got some

26:24.084 --> 26:25.978
"Don't Be So Mean" greens
in there for you today, too.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.146
<i>- You gonna love it.</i>
- Thank you, boo-boo.

26:27.170 --> 26:31.132
They so good, they're gonna make
a Vice Lord give a GD a foot massage.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.218
<i>Nigga!</i>

26:33.426 --> 26:34.844
Oh!

26:35.262 --> 26:37.973
You are like
the Al Sharpton of the fat back.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.140
Okay. Okay.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.660
When are you gonna get
your own show on VH1?

26:40.684 --> 26:42.185
Who knows, man? You know, right now,

26:42.352 --> 26:44.121
I'm just happy
being a pillar of the community,

26:44.145 --> 26:45.265
<i>trying to do something good.</i>

26:45.355 --> 26:49.359
I mean, so, you want us to believe
that you cooked all that food yourself?

26:49.526 --> 26:52.237
My kitchen workforce is
made up of ex-gangbangers,

26:52.404 --> 26:55.532
who, if they didn't have this job,
would be on the street bangin'.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.020
And you donating all the profit?

26:57.158 --> 26:58.702
What's so hard to believe about that?

27:02.122 --> 27:03.331
What is it, Eddie? What is it?

27:03.498 --> 27:05.138
Rashad, you might have
to shut your mouth.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.252
This pie got me dancing a jig over here.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.504
- Mmm-hmm.
- Don't be no sucker, Eddie.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
Oh!

27:10.839 --> 27:11.840
What's that, Rashad?

27:12.007 --> 27:14.050
I got the little peanut butter
and poverty sandwich.

27:14.259 --> 27:17.053
Did Terri cut the edges off the bread
like she does for the baby, too?

27:18.722 --> 27:21.182
Yo, J.D., man. This is on the up and up.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.035
- I'm proud of you, bro.
- Oh, thanks, Calvin.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.394
- But the name...
- What?

27:24.561 --> 27:25.812
I'm a little concerned, man.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.290
The name seems like
you're promoting something.

27:27.314 --> 27:28.732
Man, I'm just promoting food.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.609
Remember the words
of Maya Angelou, man. "Words is power."

27:31.776 --> 27:32.861
Maya Ange-who?

27:34.404 --> 27:35.989
I know who you're talking about.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.076
That big booty bitch
we went to high school with,

27:38.241 --> 27:39.826
with the lopsided titties, I remember.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.033
Calvin, come on, man.
You know I'm just joking, man.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.872
You know I know who Maya Angelou is.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.415
"Still I rise."

27:45.582 --> 27:47.250
<i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</i>

27:47.417 --> 27:50.295
Who is this on the cover?
It looks like Mike Tyson.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.271
<i>Gonna be a double-breasted suit.</i>

27:56.384 --> 27:58.803
Can't win for losing.

28:01.765 --> 28:04.351
Well, there he goes!
Harold Washington, Junior.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.371
- What up, Jimmy?
- What's up, man?

28:07.395 --> 28:08.956
- You're lookin' good.
- Good to see you.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.249
You know, you're the only
one that comes in here

28:10.273 --> 28:11.913
with a suit on that ain't goin' to court.

28:13.985 --> 28:17.280
Everybody ain't tryin' to wear one of
them granny sofa suits you got.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.740
- Guess who's back?
- Hey, Jimmy.

28:18.907 --> 28:19.949
What up, bro?

28:20.617 --> 28:21.761
<i>What bring you around here?</i>

28:21.785 --> 28:24.245
I know you didn't come
all the way over here to the South Side

28:24.412 --> 28:25.413
just for a line up.

28:25.622 --> 28:27.207
Yeah. Where's your camera crew, Jimmy?

28:27.374 --> 28:28.851
Doing a little press opp
for the mayor's office?

28:28.875 --> 28:31.437
What, a man can't check out his old
stomping grounds on his lunch break?

28:31.461 --> 28:32.462
- Hell, nah.
- No.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.297
- No.
- Hell, no.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.965
All right, you got me.

28:36.132 --> 28:39.111
I do want to talk to you all about this
council vote that's coming up next week.

28:39.135 --> 28:40.136
What vote?

28:40.303 --> 28:41.423
The one about the enclosure.

28:41.513 --> 28:42.639
- Closure?
- What enclosure?

28:42.847 --> 28:43.848
What kind of enclosure?

28:44.015 --> 28:45.683
The city plans to gate off 20 blocks,

28:45.850 --> 28:47.828
with this shop essentially
right in the middle of it.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.705
See, the idea is that
if it can control traffic,

28:49.729 --> 28:51.106
you know, one way in, one way out,

28:51.272 --> 28:52.958
<i>it'll help decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

28:52.982 --> 28:55.276
So they're just gonna
build a jail around us?

28:55.443 --> 28:57.671
Do you know what cuttin' off these
streets is gonna do to traffic?

28:57.695 --> 28:59.322
You're right. It might increase traffic.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.175
<i>But it might also decrease
violence in the neighborhood,</i>

29:01.199 --> 29:02.760
which would make
this shop more desirable.

29:02.784 --> 29:03.785
That ain't gonna help us.

29:04.202 --> 29:06.496
<i>We'll just be a non-violent empty shop.</i>

29:06.663 --> 29:10.166
Exactly. And half the businesses on
this block are barely above water.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.418
- Exactly.
- Look, y'all.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.895
I know it's not the most ideal solution.

29:12.919 --> 29:13.920
But you gotta acknowledge

29:14.087 --> 29:15.272
that at least we're trying
to do something.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.673
- No.
- Yeah. No.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.841
Hell, no.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.443
<i>Look, y'all, I share the same concerns,</i>

29:19.467 --> 29:20.861
but something's gotta be done out here.

29:20.885 --> 29:23.322
Do you know how many people get shot on
this block, every single week?

29:23.346 --> 29:24.389
Do you?

29:24.556 --> 29:27.058
'Cause we out here
dodging bullets every day,

29:27.225 --> 29:29.105
while you downtown talkin'
about the South Side,

29:29.227 --> 29:32.897
look like some Middle Eastern,
war-torn country in your $1,000 suit.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.817
You know damn well
them suits ain't $1,000, boyba.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.944
Look, Rashad, we want the same thing, man.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.780
But the council, they're all out of
ideas just like everybody else.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.031
That's right. Put it on us.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.809
<i>That's what politicians do though.</i>

29:43.950 --> 29:45.177
<i>You know, they don't do their job--</i>

29:45.201 --> 29:46.345
All I'm doing is workin', brother.

29:46.369 --> 29:47.555
<i>...but then they want us to do it.</i>

29:47.579 --> 29:48.931
And then you say it's our fault, right?

29:48.955 --> 29:50.555
Like, we the ones that don't wanna work.

29:50.707 --> 29:51.916
- Exactly.
<i>- I told you.</i>

29:52.167 --> 29:53.501
I mentioned this a long time ago.

29:54.043 --> 29:57.380
Government ain't good for nothing
but giving you syphilis and flu shots.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.133
I'm almost sure that's how I got syphilis.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.969
That is not how you got syphilis.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.847
Her name was Josephine.

30:06.055 --> 30:08.308
Would you stop
tellin' everybody's business!

30:08.558 --> 30:11.561
That's funny.
My mom's name is Josephine.

30:11.769 --> 30:12.770
Ah...

30:14.063 --> 30:15.315
Wait. What...

30:17.442 --> 30:19.522
You know, maybe
that's part of the problem. I mean...

30:19.652 --> 30:21.505
Maybe we need to
stop waiting for the government

30:21.529 --> 30:23.929
to step in and save us
and we need to start saving ourselves.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.366
<i>I mean, this is America.</i>

30:25.533 --> 30:27.577
Everybody has equal
opportunity to make it here.

30:27.744 --> 30:28.745
Really?

30:28.912 --> 30:29.913
- What?
- Okay.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.122
- Oh, man.
<i>- Oh...</i>

30:31.289 --> 30:34.042
All right. Baba ghanoush
over here lost his damn mind.

30:34.209 --> 30:35.418
Eddie, that's bullshit.

30:35.585 --> 30:36.905
You wanna know why I'm sarcastic?

30:37.003 --> 30:38.355
Because every time I open my mouth

30:38.379 --> 30:40.259
to say something real,
you gotta make fun of me.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.985
Meanwhile, if I say you're
a watermelon-flavored fried chicken lover,

30:43.009 --> 30:44.010
I'm a racist.

30:44.302 --> 30:45.303
<i>Hell, nah.</i>

30:45.637 --> 30:46.971
You'll get your ass beat.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.598
Rashad, it was hypothetical.

30:48.765 --> 30:50.993
There's no such thing
as watermelon-flavored fried chicken.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.435
Not yet, Raja.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.271
That would be stereotypically delicious.

30:55.438 --> 30:58.441
All I'm saying is, my parents
moved here from India with nothing.

30:58.733 --> 31:00.318
<i>They had no money, no friends.</i>

31:00.485 --> 31:01.765
And their accents were so thick,

31:01.903 --> 31:03.383
they couldn't even get bank accounts.

31:03.446 --> 31:04.590
And somehow they made it happen.

31:04.614 --> 31:06.783
Not to dismiss your argument here, Raja,

31:06.950 --> 31:08.826
because it is... It is riveting.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.788
However, there were
some "setbacks" that black people faced

31:11.955 --> 31:14.035
that really made things
stressful for a minute there.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.543
Slavery being at
the very top of that list.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.628
Exactly. Your ancestors were immigrants.

31:18.795 --> 31:19.796
Ours were imports.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.403
- Big difference.
<i>- Not really.</i>

31:21.464 --> 31:23.344
How do you think
the West Indies happened, okay?

31:23.508 --> 31:25.885
They took Indians,
they took black people from Africa,

31:26.052 --> 31:27.238
they put 'em in the Caribbean,

31:27.262 --> 31:30.139
and 200 years later, Rihanna happened.
You're welcome.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.643
I don't like white people either. Okay?

31:33.810 --> 31:35.970
I'm just saying, maybe y'all
should stop making excuses

31:36.104 --> 31:37.304
and actually pick up the ball.

31:37.355 --> 31:38.475
- Whoa!
- "Pick up the ball"?

31:38.523 --> 31:40.125
- Basketball reference.
- That was racist, right there.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.150
"Pick up the ball"?

31:41.317 --> 31:42.318
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

31:42.485 --> 31:44.737
It got real Fox News-y in here for me.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.740
Well, yeah,
we do be shootin' some hoop.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.343
<i>What are you talkin' about, man?</i>

31:49.367 --> 31:51.167
You think it's
a level playing field out here?

31:51.327 --> 31:53.121
You think racism don't exist no more?

31:53.288 --> 31:55.832
The President of
the United States of America is black.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.501
The most powerful man
on the planet is black.

31:58.668 --> 31:59.669
Just one man.

31:59.836 --> 32:02.964
Meanwhile, only dude I have to look up to
is the guy from <i>Big Bang Theory.</i>

32:03.172 --> 32:05.383
He funny. He make me laugh.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.928
So what does that mean for the average
black dude walking down the street?

32:09.512 --> 32:10.739
Does our president's blackness,

32:10.763 --> 32:14.142
did it stop Trayvon Martin,
or Michael Brown,

32:14.809 --> 32:17.937
or Walter Scott, or Tamir Rice,
or Freddie Gray from being killed?

32:18.104 --> 32:19.105
Hell nah.

32:19.981 --> 32:23.985
A madman walked into a Charleston church
and killed nine innocent people.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.446
<i>Did his blackness stop that?</i>

32:27.363 --> 32:30.992
Eric Garner got killed on tape
and it still didn't matter.

32:32.243 --> 32:34.203
So what are you saying, Raja?

32:34.579 --> 32:36.819
I'm not sayin' that stuff isn't messed up.
Because it is.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.124
What I'm saying is,

32:38.708 --> 32:40.168
there's never been a better time

32:40.335 --> 32:43.254
in this country
to be a black person than right now.

32:43.588 --> 32:44.881
Unless you Bill Cosby.

32:45.048 --> 32:46.168
Uh...

32:48.343 --> 32:49.927
I'm not doin' this school work.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.531
If she thinks I'm really about
to do this homework tonight...

32:52.555 --> 32:54.265
She gave us six packets.

32:54.641 --> 32:55.642
Six packets.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.019
Man, she must be insane.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.482
<i>Yo, there go those dudes
from this morning.</i>

33:18.998 --> 33:20.998
<i>I used to cut
Barack's hair back in the day.</i>

33:21.084 --> 33:23.753
Hell, I'm the one who told
him to marry Michelle.

33:24.212 --> 33:25.814
<i>- Oh!
- He liked some other little girl.</i>

33:25.838 --> 33:26.881
<i>He was gonna tell her--</i>

33:27.048 --> 33:29.008
Thelma Carter. With the big tongue.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.464
Couldn't say his name.
She used to call him "Barath."

33:33.137 --> 33:36.265
Michelle, now, that's different.
She got them childbearing hips.

33:36.599 --> 33:37.850
<i>And she can iron a shirt.</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:40.937
You see them arms right there?

33:42.438 --> 33:44.158
You never touched
a hair on that man's head.

33:44.399 --> 33:45.983
- Not one.
- Are you serious?

33:46.150 --> 33:47.777
Hold on. Okay. All right. Okay.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.465
Who do you think that is?
It's him before his hair turned gray.

33:50.738 --> 33:51.948
Oh, that could be anybody.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.866
Man, you can't tell who that is, man.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.494
It's Barack right there.
You can tell by the ear.

33:56.661 --> 33:58.621
You cannot.

33:58.955 --> 34:00.289
You can't see shit.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.042
You're stupid.

34:03.793 --> 34:05.211
You know what? Forget y'all.

34:05.378 --> 34:06.522
<i>Laugh all you want to.</i>

34:06.546 --> 34:09.257
Y'all better just leave Barack alone.
He's one of ours.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.134
He used to be one of ours.

34:11.300 --> 34:15.804
I mean, when was the last time you seen
Barack Obama do something for us?

34:16.222 --> 34:18.141
And I'm not talkin'
about for the country.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.641
I'm talkin' about for us.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.728
Eddie, even if you don't agree,

34:21.893 --> 34:23.774
you still gotta honor
what she's sayin', though.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.857
Thank you, Rashad.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.568
- I can't take this anymore, man. I'm out.
- All right.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.380
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Thank you, man.

34:30.445 --> 34:32.321
And you need to read a newspaper.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.632
Obama makes sure you
get all that birth control that you need.

34:34.657 --> 34:35.908
Excuse me?

34:36.159 --> 34:39.203
And the rest of y'all,
council vote next week. Don't forget.

34:39.370 --> 34:42.456
<i>Look, I can't let y'all tear
the President down like that. All right.</i>

34:42.623 --> 34:45.835
The man is in an impossible situation.
Know what I'm sayin'?

34:46.002 --> 34:47.202
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

34:47.295 --> 34:49.589
He's not just the president
of black America.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.007
He's the President of
the United States of America.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.052
And personally,
I think he's doin' a great job.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.015
You know what? The two of them just make
me believe in the sanctity of marriage.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.809
I hate to be
the one to say this...

35:03.311 --> 35:04.896
But Barack has definitely got bitches.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.522
Oh, yeah, he does.

35:06.689 --> 35:08.041
No, he has not.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.065
Half these hoes weren't even registered
to vote before he ran for president.

35:11.194 --> 35:12.195
<i>Give me a break!</i>

35:12.361 --> 35:16.324
Every vote... Ass. Ass, ass, ass.
That's what it is.

35:16.616 --> 35:19.243
Oh... You know what?
I hate to agree with Dante,

35:19.410 --> 35:21.329
'cause it's just a bad look.

35:21.496 --> 35:24.040
But every president has a side chick.

35:24.499 --> 35:25.583
<i>It's constitutional.</i>

35:25.750 --> 35:29.378
You know, Thomas Jefferson
had a whole plantation of side chicks.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.881
I bet you Hillary's got a side chick.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.591
Probably thick, too.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.722
- What's up, Terri?
- What up, Quis?

35:45.102 --> 35:47.647
Looks like you're on
the wrong side of town, nigga.

35:48.815 --> 35:51.776
Boy, this whole city is mine.
These are my blocks.

35:52.068 --> 35:54.546
And I don't see nobody out there
strong enough to take it from me.

35:54.570 --> 35:55.571
Shit.

35:55.780 --> 35:56.781
So what are you sayin'?

35:56.948 --> 35:58.091
You tryin' to embarrass yourself

35:58.115 --> 35:59.384
- and get blood on the floor.
- Embarrass myself?

35:59.408 --> 36:00.552
No! Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

36:00.576 --> 36:01.616
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

36:01.744 --> 36:02.784
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

36:02.912 --> 36:03.996
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

36:04.163 --> 36:05.581
Listen! Wait! Listen!

36:05.748 --> 36:07.083
Listen a minute! No! No! Look...

36:07.250 --> 36:08.417
I'll blow your head off, man.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.752
<i>Look, not in here!</i>

36:09.919 --> 36:12.022
Y'all wanna kill each other,
y'all take that shit outside!

36:12.046 --> 36:13.047
Well, let's go outside!

36:13.256 --> 36:14.336
Calvin, what he doing here?

36:14.423 --> 36:15.675
I booked him. I booked him.

36:15.842 --> 36:17.903
He has a standing appointment
with me every other week.

36:17.927 --> 36:19.404
It got messed up when he went to jail

36:19.428 --> 36:20.739
and I didn't know Quis
was gonna be here today.

36:20.763 --> 36:21.764
I'm sorry, y'all.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.171
- Stupid nigga!
- Jay! Jay! Jay!

36:23.224 --> 36:24.624
- That's what I'm doing here!
- Jay!

36:24.725 --> 36:25.869
- Jay! Look at me.
- What you gonna do?

36:25.893 --> 36:27.186
Look at me, Jay!

36:27.770 --> 36:29.063
Come back in an hour.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.273
Come back in an hour.

36:30.523 --> 36:31.524
<i>Please.</i>

36:31.691 --> 36:32.692
<i>Please.</i>

36:32.984 --> 36:34.360
I'll take care of your bill.

36:34.610 --> 36:35.820
On me.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.740
I'll pay for everything,
I'll pay for your hair, man.

36:41.492 --> 36:42.952
That's cool, Calvin.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.831
All right. Thank you!

36:46.998 --> 36:48.457
- You know me, boy.
- Thank you, man!

36:48.624 --> 36:49.625
You a stupid nigga.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.103
<i>- Come on, man.
- I'm telling you!</i>

36:51.127 --> 36:52.295
You know what it is.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.901
<i>In an hour, man. In an hour.</i>

36:56.299 --> 36:57.592
I'm sorry.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.331
- Thanks, Shad.
- It's all right.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.055
Big boy, I'm sorry about that, man.
Misunderstanding.

37:04.473 --> 37:08.102
We usually have that schedule
worked out a little better.

37:08.561 --> 37:09.937
It's all good, Calvin.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.794
You know, I'm gonna have to
get that thing from you.

37:15.818 --> 37:16.819
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

37:23.701 --> 37:24.952
The other one, too.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.914
Oh man, I forgot about that one.

37:30.666 --> 37:31.709
Damn shame.

37:33.044 --> 37:34.754
<i>Can't even go to the barbershop no more</i>

37:34.921 --> 37:37.840
<i>without some knucklehead
bringin' a gun in here.</i>

37:38.382 --> 37:40.718
Barbershop used to be a place of peace.

37:41.177 --> 37:42.678
It's for my protection.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.181
From what? Some clippers?

37:45.681 --> 37:48.517
What the hell you
need to be bringing that in here for?

37:48.893 --> 37:50.353
It's my constitutional right.

37:50.519 --> 37:51.520
Nigga, spell it.

37:52.897 --> 37:54.982
Constitutional right!

37:55.691 --> 37:58.411
You need to worry about why ain't nobody
ever sitting in them chairs.

37:58.527 --> 37:59.862
You probably shot them all.

38:02.573 --> 38:03.616
Yeah, this Calvin.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.576
It might be a better question for you.

38:05.743 --> 38:07.161
- Crazy. Crazy.
- Is he okay?

38:07.370 --> 38:08.621
Wait. Is he okay?

38:08.788 --> 38:10.515
<i>Man. Come on, man.
We all lived out here...</i>

38:10.539 --> 38:11.582
No, I'll be on my way.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.764
I'll be there.
Rashad, handle that for me.

38:13.876 --> 38:14.877
Yo, Cal, what's up?

38:15.044 --> 38:16.253
I got you, no worries.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.589
No! Hell, no, man! He said Rashad.

38:18.756 --> 38:19.942
No, I don't think he said Rashad.

38:19.966 --> 38:20.967
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

38:21.133 --> 38:22.468
Yeah. He said me, Eddie.

38:22.635 --> 38:23.886
Specifically?

38:24.053 --> 38:25.846
He called you by name?

38:35.564 --> 38:38.567
Baby, are you okay? Did anybody hit you?

38:39.026 --> 38:40.146
<i>No, nothing happened.</i>

38:40.236 --> 38:41.838
<i>I was just standing there
and a fight broke out.</i>

38:41.862 --> 38:43.006
Oh, don't worry. We're gonna get this

38:43.030 --> 38:44.383
- all straightened out.
- Mom! I'm fine.

38:44.407 --> 38:46.127
- Let me see your head.
<i>- No, Mom, I'm okay.</i>

38:46.242 --> 38:48.411
My God. It's, like, red right here.

38:48.661 --> 38:49.662
Goodness.

38:50.246 --> 38:51.789
Let me see your face.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.087
<i>So, what happened?</i>

38:58.421 --> 39:00.047
Well, frankly, Mr. Palmer,

39:00.214 --> 39:03.294
we're concerned about the people that
Jalen's been hanging around with lately.

39:03.426 --> 39:04.593
Are you talking about Kenny?

39:05.344 --> 39:06.679
Why would you say that?

39:06.929 --> 39:08.931
'Cause that's who
he's been hanging with every day.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.642
You guys know I can't talk
about anybody else's kids.

39:11.809 --> 39:13.019
But let me just say this.

39:13.269 --> 39:15.855
Jalen has shifted
over these past few weeks.

39:16.022 --> 39:17.148
His behavior is different.

39:17.314 --> 39:18.733
<i>His teachers have noticed it.</i>

39:18.941 --> 39:20.443
<i>His grades have started to slip.</i>

39:20.609 --> 39:21.969
And the fight that happened today,

39:22.069 --> 39:24.947
he was involved in that fight,
which turned out to be gang-related.

39:25.114 --> 39:27.759
What do you mean "involved"?
Are you trying to say Jalen's in a gang?

39:27.783 --> 39:29.618
If he's not already in a gang,

39:30.161 --> 39:32.246
he's strongly considering joining one.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.540
No, no. I'm sorry, Jalen...

39:34.707 --> 39:36.309
He knows better than that.
He wouldn't do that.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.294
I understand why you feel
that way, Mrs. Palmer,

39:38.461 --> 39:41.464
but there's also a reality of what
we face in our communities.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.924
So this year is absolutely
critical for him

39:44.091 --> 39:46.177
to build a foundation
to go off to college.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.554
See? This is what
I've been talking about.

39:48.763 --> 39:50.181
I mean, with Jalen's grades,

39:50.389 --> 39:51.629
his test scores...

39:51.682 --> 39:53.618
No way in the world
we can't get him a scholarship

39:53.642 --> 39:55.936
at the private schools,
or remember Holy Cross

39:56.103 --> 39:57.247
I was telling you, that Catholic School?

39:57.271 --> 39:58.351
We have to talk about this.

39:58.439 --> 39:59.440
I'll talk to their coach.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.150
Mr. Palmer, now hold up.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.569
Hold up.
Now, that's not what I was suggesting.

40:03.736 --> 40:06.405
We want Jalen to be here.
The school needs him here.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.615
For what?

40:07.990 --> 40:09.158
Seem like y'all losing him.

40:09.325 --> 40:10.826
Mr. Palmer, I understand...

40:10.993 --> 40:12.286
I'm supposed to sit here

40:12.453 --> 40:15.456
and we're going to sacrifice
our only son to this system?

40:15.664 --> 40:17.976
There's gotta be something
we can do to work together on this.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.961
Seems like the problem
is bigger than you and me.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.964
So, why are you pointing
the finger at Kenny?

40:24.131 --> 40:27.760
No, look.
I've been skeptical about that kid.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.027
The whole reason he's living with Rashad

40:30.137 --> 40:32.348
is because he got expelled
from school for fighting.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.184
Probably some gang-related shit.

40:35.643 --> 40:37.686
I ain't trying to have
Jalen get caught up,

40:37.853 --> 40:39.730
following behind some
little wannabe thug.

40:40.064 --> 40:42.691
So, you know, maybe we just
talk to him again

40:42.858 --> 40:44.193
or we ground him or something.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.004
I don't know,
but don't you think sending him

40:46.028 --> 40:47.822
to Holy Cross is a little bit extreme?

40:47.988 --> 40:51.117
After what we just heard?
We gotta send him somewhere!

40:51.784 --> 40:54.065
I'm not trying to get that call
in the middle of the night

40:54.161 --> 40:56.205
saying my son is locked up or worse,

40:56.372 --> 40:58.290
because we didn't act
when we had a chance.

41:00.543 --> 41:02.169
Keep your elbow tucked.

41:03.504 --> 41:04.880
Catholic school?

41:05.047 --> 41:07.133
I don't know anybody in Catholic school.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.718
Good. Maybe it's time for you
to meet some Catholics.

41:10.136 --> 41:13.597
And tomorrow, I'm gonna re-introduce you
to the concept of a belt.

41:14.223 --> 41:16.392
Ain't nobody wants to see
your butt cheeks hanging out.

41:16.559 --> 41:17.893
Nobody wears no belts.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.228
They're corny.

41:19.395 --> 41:20.855
Yeah, well, so is getting shot.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.042
When are you going to do something about

41:24.066 --> 41:26.068
that abomination on your head
called locks?

41:26.235 --> 41:27.570
I'm not cutting my locks.

41:27.736 --> 41:29.613
You need to do something with them.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.009
You're the son of a barber,
you can't be walking around here

41:33.033 --> 41:35.273
looking like that girl from
<i>The Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

41:35.828 --> 41:37.228
They're supposed to look like that.

41:37.371 --> 41:38.581
No, they're not.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.833
When you going to wash them things, man?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.586
Walking around smelling like
Flavor Flav's wave cap.

41:43.961 --> 41:46.964
Why are you trying to take
everything I like away from me?

41:51.427 --> 41:53.345
Because I love you, that's why.

41:55.973 --> 41:57.742
So just because you take some
long dramatic pause

41:57.766 --> 41:58.767
before you say something,

41:58.934 --> 42:01.478
I'm supposed to just accept your words?

42:02.605 --> 42:04.064
You're so smart, Jalen.

42:05.608 --> 42:07.735
If you're that smart,
keep your elbow tucked.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.112
My elbow is tucked. My shot is water.

42:12.448 --> 42:13.782
Your shot sucks.

42:14.450 --> 42:15.534
Whose shots suck?

42:16.368 --> 42:17.953
Boy, you better ask somebody.

42:18.746 --> 42:20.122
My shot is butter.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.211
Ew!

42:31.884 --> 42:32.885
What up, broski?

42:34.303 --> 42:35.930
I got your message.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.723
Shorties is wiling, right?

42:37.890 --> 42:39.308
How are you?

42:39.475 --> 42:42.394
Look, I'm going to need you to
keep your son away from mine.

42:42.853 --> 42:44.063
What you talking about?

42:44.271 --> 42:46.191
You know that gang fight
that happened yesterday?

42:46.565 --> 42:48.484
Kenny got Jalen involved in that shit.

42:48.651 --> 42:49.902
No, that ain't what happened.

42:50.069 --> 42:53.239
I talked to Kenny, he said they was
standing there and the fight broke out.

42:54.031 --> 42:55.032
And you believed him?

42:55.449 --> 42:57.701
Yeah, I believe him. He's my son.

42:58.077 --> 42:59.662
You taking Jalen's word for it.

42:59.828 --> 43:00.829
You damn right!

43:00.996 --> 43:03.332
Jalen ain't never got
expelled from school for fighting.

43:04.625 --> 43:05.793
Oh, is it like that?

43:07.086 --> 43:09.088
I tell you something in
confidence, man-to-man,

43:09.255 --> 43:11.423
and now you throwing that shit
back in my face?

43:11.924 --> 43:14.343
I told you that's who Kenny was
when he was with his mother.

43:14.677 --> 43:16.637
He ain't that kid no more, he with me.

43:16.804 --> 43:18.472
I'm happy for you.

43:18.639 --> 43:19.848
Nevertheless,

43:20.015 --> 43:22.893
keep your son away from mine, man,
or we gonna have a problem.

43:25.187 --> 43:28.691
Bruh, we got a problem right now.

43:29.942 --> 43:31.110
<i>Wow!</i>

43:31.443 --> 43:35.531
Two black fathers
bonding in the hood.

43:35.698 --> 43:36.782
It's rare.

43:36.949 --> 43:38.534
It's like catching a unicorn.

43:38.701 --> 43:41.203
You don't see it every day,
is what I'm trying to say. Right?

43:43.122 --> 43:44.581
You want a latte?

43:46.000 --> 43:49.295
"One-Stop's Home and Office Decoration."

43:49.461 --> 43:50.462
Ghetto office.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.673
Ghetto office,
you decorate somebody's shit.

43:55.551 --> 43:56.844
So the dog ate the whole condom?

43:57.011 --> 43:58.012
Yeah.

43:58.178 --> 43:59.680
Frame your face. Shit.

44:01.974 --> 44:04.893
- Okay, Eddie. Come on, man.
- Oh.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.060
You know what, I've happened
to have enough of him.

44:08.856 --> 44:10.616
Lord, they shooting!
They shooting out there!

44:10.733 --> 44:12.067
Eddie, stop playing! Get down!

44:12.234 --> 44:14.486
Hell! It'll take me too long
to get back up.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.453
I ain't getting down there,
it ain't worth it.

44:17.156 --> 44:18.157
It's fine.

44:18.324 --> 44:20.367
This ain't Fallujah. Come on.
Everybody, stand up.

44:23.662 --> 44:24.830
<i>My God. I gotta go.</i>

44:24.997 --> 44:25.998
I can't take it.

44:26.165 --> 44:27.833
Baby, that's a gang out there.

44:28.042 --> 44:29.585
<i>It ain't no ice cream truck.</i>

44:29.752 --> 44:32.152
The idea is stay away from the bullet,
don't go towards them.

44:32.254 --> 44:33.648
I don't think you understand, Eddie.

44:33.672 --> 44:34.952
My car broke down earlier today.

44:35.090 --> 44:38.594
I can't be caught outside with no car
and it's dark and they're shooting...

44:38.761 --> 44:40.572
- Draya, I got you.
<i>- It's crazy right now!</i>

44:40.596 --> 44:42.276
<i>I gotta get Maya anyway.
You're on the way,</i>

44:42.389 --> 44:43.432
so I got you.

44:43.599 --> 44:44.933
Are you serious, Rashad?

44:45.100 --> 44:46.494
<i>Hold on, let me get my stuff.</i>

44:47.770 --> 44:48.896
Thank you.

44:50.105 --> 44:51.505
<i>All right. You good, Eddie?</i>

44:52.024 --> 44:53.359
Yeah, I'm good.

44:54.777 --> 44:56.779
I need to get on out of here anyway.

44:57.613 --> 44:59.281
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

44:59.615 --> 45:01.033
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

45:01.575 --> 45:04.370
With all that ass, she ain't safe nowhere.

45:04.912 --> 45:07.140
The New York Times
<i>broke this down recently.</i>

45:07.164 --> 45:09.833
Okay, let's see.

45:16.965 --> 45:20.302
<i>The second amendment means
we have a right to bear arms.</i>

45:20.469 --> 45:23.639
<i>Should it also mean that
there is no place in our...</i>

45:38.070 --> 45:41.407
I cannot believe that crazy man
came in the store doing that today.

45:41.573 --> 45:42.950
He was wild!

45:43.742 --> 45:45.661
No, he played us all.

45:45.869 --> 45:46.870
He was crazy.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.288
Crazy!

45:52.793 --> 45:54.503
All right, then.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.172
I'll catch you tomorrow.

46:04.972 --> 46:06.348
Are you okay, Rashad?

46:06.807 --> 46:08.350
Like, seriously.

46:08.851 --> 46:11.812
Like, I don't know,
lately you've been so stressed out.

46:12.271 --> 46:13.856
I'm good! I'm good.

46:14.022 --> 46:15.190
You good?

46:15.357 --> 46:16.442
Draya, I'm good.

46:16.692 --> 46:19.611
Well, if you need anything,

46:19.778 --> 46:22.531
even if you just want to talk,
I'm a great listener.

46:24.158 --> 46:26.702
I know you cool. I appreciate that.

46:26.869 --> 46:28.954
I might take you up on that one day.

46:31.039 --> 46:33.000
Well, what time you gotta pick up Maya?

46:34.835 --> 46:38.755
Maybe we can go upstairs
and we could talk now.

46:39.506 --> 46:40.841
Come on, Draya.

46:41.258 --> 46:42.301
What?

46:42.801 --> 46:45.429
You're inviting me to your house
just to come and talk?

46:46.346 --> 46:48.140
As opposed to what?

46:48.307 --> 46:50.684
I mean, I ain't been out
the game that long, Draya.

46:51.351 --> 46:52.728
Are you serious?

46:53.520 --> 46:56.398
A pretty girl tries to comfort you
in your time of stress

46:56.565 --> 46:58.042
and whatever the hell else
you're going through,

46:58.066 --> 46:59.693
and you gonna take it there with me?

47:00.652 --> 47:03.322
Look, my bad.
I thought you was really...

47:03.489 --> 47:06.241
Come on. Just because I'm thick,
it doesn't mean I don't have a soul.

47:06.408 --> 47:08.219
But the way you was talking,
it felt like you wanted to...

47:08.243 --> 47:09.387
You know what? Good night, Rashad.

47:09.411 --> 47:11.246
It felt like... I thought you was...

47:12.039 --> 47:13.040
Good night, Rashad!

47:13.207 --> 47:14.249
<i>Draya, it felt...</i>

47:14.416 --> 47:16.001
Draya! Draya!

47:17.419 --> 47:18.545
Damn!

47:19.546 --> 47:20.839
Damn. Oh.

47:21.882 --> 47:22.966
Oh, man.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.093
Ah, man.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.425
Man, she definitely wanted it.
I know she wanted it!

47:27.554 --> 47:29.848
Hell, yeah! What do you think?

47:30.015 --> 47:32.296
You think I ain't gonna think that?
I mean, she got the...

47:32.434 --> 47:34.603
She sitting there
with it all out like, "Yo."

47:34.770 --> 47:36.438
Leaning over. I mean...

47:36.605 --> 47:39.005
I ain't tripping, right?
I ain't been out the game that long.

47:39.107 --> 47:40.400
You know what I'm saying?

47:40.567 --> 47:44.738
Damn! She said,
"You wanna come inside and talk..."

47:46.198 --> 47:49.451
She definitely wanted it. Right? Right?

47:50.744 --> 47:52.722
Baby, I just wanted you
to know that you were right!

47:52.746 --> 47:54.289
You hit the nail on the head.

47:54.456 --> 47:56.041
- Babe, listen.
<i>- You had the hammer!</i>

47:56.208 --> 47:58.293
We gonna send his heathen ass
to Catholic school!

47:58.460 --> 48:00.462
- Babe, stop it!
<i>- I'm gonna call the Catholics.</i>

48:00.629 --> 48:02.273
I'm gonna call Jesus.
Somebody call some Marys.

48:02.297 --> 48:04.132
- Okay...
<i>- The Holy Cross, we coming!</i>

48:04.424 --> 48:06.134
You and your lady having problems, huh?

48:06.301 --> 48:08.971
I can help.
You know I have counseling services.

48:09.137 --> 48:11.223
I got single, I got couple, I got group.

48:11.557 --> 48:13.976
<i>If you choose groups,
the responsibilities would be</i>

48:14.309 --> 48:15.811
to bring in cookies and, or,

48:15.978 --> 48:17.854
fruit punch every third meeting.

48:19.314 --> 48:22.276
No, thank you, man. I'm good.
We don't need no damn session.

48:22.651 --> 48:24.486
Here, man. Here's the check.

48:24.653 --> 48:25.654
Mmm!

48:25.821 --> 48:27.322
Calvin, before I take that check,

48:27.489 --> 48:29.408
I'm going to tell you,
it's non-refundable.

48:29.783 --> 48:32.160
If I take that check,
that check goes away.

48:32.327 --> 48:35.998
And if you don't have that
remaining balance on Monday,

48:36.164 --> 48:37.165
I promise you,

48:37.332 --> 48:39.835
it is not a homing pigeon,
it does not come back.

48:40.294 --> 48:42.374
You know how Mike Tyson has
those birds on that roof?

48:42.421 --> 48:45.257
He can let those birds go.
"Go, go!" You know?

48:45.632 --> 48:48.677
Birds fly around,
birds come back on his hand.

48:48.844 --> 48:50.012
He looks at that bird.

48:50.220 --> 48:52.014
Right?

48:52.180 --> 48:53.575
That ain't gonna happen. You understand?

48:53.599 --> 48:54.919
I know what non-refundable means.

48:55.017 --> 48:56.351
It's forfeited.

48:56.518 --> 48:58.329
I just wanna let you know.
'Cause you're my man.

48:58.353 --> 49:01.648
Damn, man. Is it One-Stop or non-stop?
Take the check.

49:04.526 --> 49:07.195
Certified check. Nice.

49:07.362 --> 49:09.531
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Calvin.

49:10.490 --> 49:11.930
I'm gonna hold off on that handshake

49:12.034 --> 49:15.829
until you make that remaining
balance payment on Monday.

49:15.996 --> 49:18.790
Just in case you do some nigga shit.

49:19.166 --> 49:20.876
Hey, don't tell nobody.

49:21.835 --> 49:24.379
It's going down
this weekend, y'all!

49:24.546 --> 49:26.024
Jackie, what are you talking about now?

49:26.048 --> 49:28.550
<i>Girl, my husband's
got me all stressed out.</i>

49:28.717 --> 49:31.219
Police got him working
back-to-back double shifts.

49:31.845 --> 49:34.431
Okay. I just need
a little touch up now, Angie.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.724
Oh!

49:35.891 --> 49:37.059
- Touch up?
- Mmm-hmm.

49:37.309 --> 49:41.688
No. No, baby, you got to pull them roots
all the way up like a turnip...

49:41.897 --> 49:43.357
<i>Turn it over, ball it</i>

49:43.523 --> 49:45.692
and then put it back in your head.

49:45.901 --> 49:47.653
Jackie, I mean, no shade,

49:47.819 --> 49:50.530
but, God, you should be ashamed
to walk out the house like this.

49:50.697 --> 49:54.409
Girl, how you gonna say, "No shade,"
and then shade the shit out that lady.

49:55.077 --> 49:56.328
<i>Thank you.</i>

49:56.495 --> 49:58.705
Y'all know the boy
that got shot didn't make it.

49:58.914 --> 50:00.999
- Oh, my God. That's terrible.
- Uh-huh.

50:01.166 --> 50:02.167
No.

50:02.334 --> 50:03.654
Pronounced him dead this morning.

50:04.503 --> 50:06.421
<i>My husband said that
this whole thing started</i>

50:06.588 --> 50:07.589
because of some fight

50:07.756 --> 50:09.476
that happened over there
at the high school.

50:10.926 --> 50:13.637
Y'all know what happened last time
one of their leaders got killed.

50:14.054 --> 50:15.055
It was a bloodbath.

50:15.222 --> 50:16.407
Well, the police chief's planning on

50:16.431 --> 50:18.725
doubling the amount of cops
on the streets this weekend.

50:18.892 --> 50:20.435
Man, I'm so tired of this mess!

50:20.602 --> 50:21.895
<i>Every time I turn around,</i>

50:22.062 --> 50:23.772
somebody is killing somebody over nothing.

50:23.980 --> 50:25.124
<i>And what are we supposed to do?</i>

50:25.148 --> 50:27.109
Lock our doors, don't snitch.

50:27.359 --> 50:29.194
Pretend like this shit is normal?

50:29.403 --> 50:30.946
This is bullshit, this is not normal.

50:31.113 --> 50:32.614
Then we gotta do something about it.

50:33.323 --> 50:36.410
Shorties out here wiling
and that's our fault. That's on us.

50:36.910 --> 50:39.454
Look, if we get people
to come to the shop,

50:39.621 --> 50:42.124
I don't care what neighborhood they from.
They from Chatham,

50:42.290 --> 50:45.293
<i>from Englewood, East Side,
crazy, wherever they from,</i>

50:45.460 --> 50:46.795
we just need people from the city

50:46.962 --> 50:49.423
to come meet up in the shop,
and we just talk.

50:49.631 --> 50:50.911
<i>And give them a chance to speak.</i>

50:51.049 --> 50:52.426
They're gonna come up with ideas.

50:52.592 --> 50:54.219
I think that's a great idea, Rashad.

50:54.803 --> 50:56.805
Really great idea, baby.

50:57.681 --> 50:58.974
Well, I say we do it.

50:59.266 --> 51:00.576
<i>Y'all know we have to do it.</i>

51:00.600 --> 51:02.060
I mean, the gangs have us scared.

51:02.269 --> 51:03.437
They're killing everybody.

51:03.645 --> 51:05.397
<i>We don't wanna walk outside anymore.</i>

51:05.564 --> 51:07.482
Them people downtown,
they aren't moving for us.

51:07.649 --> 51:10.569
I mean, if we don't do something,
no one's gonna save our community.

51:10.777 --> 51:13.238
We gotta take our streets back.

51:24.458 --> 51:25.459
<i>Action, LeShawn!</i>

51:25.625 --> 51:27.270
- Stacia!
<i>- Sorry, action, Stacia!</i>

51:27.294 --> 51:28.614
Stop the violence, y'all!

51:28.670 --> 51:30.505
Exactly. Calvin's Shop.

51:30.672 --> 51:31.816
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

51:31.840 --> 51:33.985
- Oh, come on, man!
<i>- You watch that booty shaking!</i>

51:34.009 --> 51:35.510
- Calvin's Shop...
- Listen, guys!

51:35.677 --> 51:36.863
We know you don't
care about your community,

51:36.887 --> 51:39.264
but you gotta care about this.

51:39.473 --> 51:40.825
<i>Please come down to Calvin's Shop tonight</i>

51:40.849 --> 51:41.933
for the community summit,

51:42.100 --> 51:43.685
because dreams apparently

51:43.852 --> 51:45.687
are being deferred even as we speak.

51:45.854 --> 51:47.689
- Yeah!
- I think we got it.

51:50.192 --> 51:51.276
Okay.

51:56.448 --> 51:58.200
<i>- Move!
- Ow.</i>

51:59.367 --> 52:00.869
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>

52:01.119 --> 52:02.996
<i>You can look, but do not touch.</i>

52:03.205 --> 52:04.372
<i>Look back at it.</i>

52:04.539 --> 52:06.208
<i>- You like that?
- I'm good.</i>

52:06.374 --> 52:07.518
<i>We're out in the street, you know.</i>

52:07.542 --> 52:08.728
<i>This isn't the privacy
of your own bedroom.</i>

52:08.752 --> 52:09.836
<i>Yeah, girl!</i>

52:18.345 --> 52:20.388
<i>We wanna
thank y'all for being here.</i>

52:20.555 --> 52:22.891
There's still seats available
if you need a seat.

52:23.058 --> 52:25.685
It's important that we all are here
because this is our community.

52:25.894 --> 52:29.064
<i>And it's up to us to change it,
so, we wanna hear y'all ideas.</i>

52:29.648 --> 52:31.525
I was thinking more like
a benefit concert.

52:31.691 --> 52:33.193
You know, something for the kids.

52:33.485 --> 52:34.925
<i>I think we should just call up Kanye</i>

52:35.070 --> 52:36.547
and have him come on out and perform.

52:36.571 --> 52:38.156
Yes!

52:39.032 --> 52:41.952
He ain't coming around y'all
broke negroes.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.245
Are you serious right now?

52:43.411 --> 52:45.121
<i>Look, Kanye a Kardashian now.</i>

52:45.413 --> 52:47.082
He wears dresses now.

52:47.249 --> 52:49.084
I seen him on TV, he had a skirt on.

52:49.251 --> 52:50.252
His knees were showing.

52:50.418 --> 52:52.754
All right, all right, all right. Relax!

52:54.172 --> 52:55.173
What about R. Kelly?

52:55.340 --> 52:56.341
What?

52:56.508 --> 52:58.343
R. Kelly? For a kids benefit?

52:58.510 --> 52:59.678
Kelly love the kids.

52:59.845 --> 53:01.725
Yeah, he can teach them
how to make home movies.

53:02.222 --> 53:03.223
No, he didn't.

53:03.390 --> 53:05.767
All right, already! Leave him alone!

53:05.934 --> 53:09.521
Do you realize how much good quality
R&B we'd have missed out on,

53:09.688 --> 53:11.940
because y'all keep bringing up
that same old bull?

53:12.107 --> 53:13.358
<i>The last albums he made,</i>

53:13.525 --> 53:15.861
them albums was made out of pure stress.

53:16.778 --> 53:19.239
Does anybody else have any other ideas?

53:19.573 --> 53:20.782
I'd like to say something.

53:21.408 --> 53:22.868
Look, Eddie, you once said

53:23.118 --> 53:25.096
that the barbershop is
the pillar of the neighborhood.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.246
Damn right!

53:26.413 --> 53:27.539
So we use that, right?

53:27.706 --> 53:30.125
We turn the shop into our
safe space for the weekend.

53:30.375 --> 53:31.769
<i>All right?
Neutral grounds where both sides</i>

53:31.793 --> 53:32.961
can come together peacefully.

53:33.128 --> 53:34.462
- I like that.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

53:34.629 --> 53:36.798
- Turn this place into Switzerland.
- Exactly!

53:36.965 --> 53:38.234
Ain't no way in hell the South Side

53:38.258 --> 53:40.635
is ever going to resemble
any parts of Switzerland.

53:41.052 --> 53:42.637
I don't even know no black Swiss.

53:42.804 --> 53:43.889
I mean, Swizz Beatz.

53:44.055 --> 53:46.266
<i>Is he black? Or is he white?</i>

53:46.433 --> 53:48.143
You know, he is a little beige.

53:48.310 --> 53:50.312
<i>He might be Swiss. I mean...</i>

53:50.478 --> 53:52.981
He named himself to it.
So, he's Swiss. He's Swiss.

53:53.148 --> 53:54.292
<i>Can we get back to it?</i>

53:54.316 --> 53:56.156
We could try to get
both sides to come together

53:56.234 --> 53:57.986
and agree to a ceasefire.

53:58.153 --> 53:59.673
<i>And then we can get the Chicago celebs</i>

53:59.738 --> 54:01.178
to tweet about it and talk about it.

54:01.323 --> 54:02.616
Get them to support.

54:02.782 --> 54:03.950
That's good, Jerrod.

54:04.117 --> 54:05.160
You know what, he's right.

54:05.327 --> 54:07.913
That means that we have
to give them something to see.

54:08.079 --> 54:09.919
Yeah, maybe we could
just give away free gifts.

54:10.081 --> 54:11.249
Like a radio promotion.

54:11.416 --> 54:12.417
Yes!

54:12.584 --> 54:14.228
And who's supposed to pay
for these free gifts?

54:14.252 --> 54:18.256
Draya is right, we need some
incentive to bring people out.

54:18.423 --> 54:21.760
I don't want to state the obvious here,
but this is a barbershop.

54:22.135 --> 54:24.804
We could just do what we already do.
For free.

54:24.971 --> 54:26.306
Free cuts the whole weekend?

54:26.473 --> 54:28.600
You know how much money
we pull in on Saturday alone?

54:28.767 --> 54:31.645
Do you know how much we're gonna
lose if that enclosure happens?

54:31.811 --> 54:33.521
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's a great idea, Calvin.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.106
<i>It is. It is a great idea.</i>

54:35.273 --> 54:36.650
Yeah, a 48-hour ceasefire,

54:36.858 --> 54:39.611
with unlimited free cuts and styling.

54:39.778 --> 54:41.863
I mean, come on,
who could turn that down?

54:42.030 --> 54:45.533
I propose that Gangsta Grub
be the official caterer for this.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.202
Yeah, I bet you would.

54:47.369 --> 54:48.804
Hell, yeah, dude!
You know how much money

54:48.828 --> 54:51.790
I can make out on these streets
in a 48-hour...

54:52.457 --> 54:54.834
To donate to the Boys and Girls Club!

54:55.001 --> 54:56.211
That's R. Kelly's favorite.

54:56.378 --> 54:57.671
<i>Listen here, Bollyhood!</i>

54:58.129 --> 54:59.506
Leave Kels alone, God damn it,

54:59.673 --> 55:01.591
I say, God damn it, leave Kels alone!

55:02.384 --> 55:03.843
Sorry about that, go ahead.

55:04.177 --> 55:06.137
Then I think that we have a plan!

55:12.978 --> 55:15.188
Hold up, hold up.
We've got one little problem.

55:15.897 --> 55:17.524
<i>Y'all know to have a ceasefire,</i>

55:17.691 --> 55:20.068
we got to get the shot callers
to call a truce.

55:20.777 --> 55:22.296
<i>Y'all know what happened the last time</i>

55:22.320 --> 55:24.406
we got Marquis and Jay up in here.

55:24.656 --> 55:25.896
It was damn near World War III.

55:25.991 --> 55:27.242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:29.035 --> 55:31.746
But you know what?
What if we made that mix-up happen again?

55:46.052 --> 55:47.887
<i>This is just a terrible idea.</i>

55:48.054 --> 55:49.454
Yeah. "Let's cause a little mix-up.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.349
"Let's make that mix-up happen again."

55:51.516 --> 55:52.868
That was the dumbest thing you ever said.

55:52.892 --> 55:54.120
Do you know who these people are?

55:54.144 --> 55:55.145
<i>They are murderers.</i>

55:55.311 --> 55:57.081
<i>They don't work at the grocery store,
and if they did,</i>

55:57.105 --> 55:58.898
they would be butchers.

55:59.065 --> 56:00.108
Quiet!

56:00.275 --> 56:03.069
Thank God you wore
a G-Unit bulletproof vest.

56:03.236 --> 56:04.821
Yeah, it worked for 50!

56:05.113 --> 56:08.908
No, it didn't, actually.
He got shot in the face!

56:09.409 --> 56:10.618
He got shot in the face?

56:11.453 --> 56:13.705
Draya! What's up, baby girl?

56:14.748 --> 56:16.225
Hold up, Calvin! What's going on in here?

56:16.249 --> 56:17.792
Is this a set-up?

56:18.084 --> 56:19.961
- Listen to me.
- Jay! Jay!

56:20.128 --> 56:21.171
No, stop!

56:21.337 --> 56:22.523
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

56:22.547 --> 56:24.632
Hold on!

56:24.799 --> 56:26.217
Hold on! Wait a minute!

56:26.384 --> 56:27.635
- I wish you would, boy!
- Jay!

56:27.802 --> 56:30.597
Listen! Now, I've been knowing you guys
for about 20 years, man.

56:30.764 --> 56:32.116
My father used to cut both of your heads!

56:32.140 --> 56:33.433
Come on, bruh.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.720
Out of respect for him
and the shop, man, hear us out.

56:35.769 --> 56:37.562
We're asking y'all for 10 minutes.

56:37.729 --> 56:39.647
<i>That's all we asking for, bruh.</i>

56:42.484 --> 56:45.528
Oh, I need more time, God.
I don't wanna die a virgin.

56:45.904 --> 56:47.155
Come on, Jason.

56:47.322 --> 56:48.615
Come on, G. Come on, man.

56:48.782 --> 56:50.241
<i>Let's do this, man.</i>

56:50.408 --> 56:51.576
Have a seat.

57:00.335 --> 57:01.669
We all good. Come on, big boy.

57:01.836 --> 57:04.631
Sit on down for a second. Get on.

57:18.186 --> 57:19.354
Are we good?

57:22.565 --> 57:24.234
Hey, Rev.

57:24.526 --> 57:26.903
Fifteen fish dinners for bingo night?

57:27.070 --> 57:28.780
Hell, yeah! Ha-ha!

57:28.947 --> 57:30.406
I mean, praise God!

57:30.573 --> 57:32.867
How about some sweet potato pie?
All right.

57:34.077 --> 57:36.329
All right! What's cooking? Daddy's home!

57:36.496 --> 57:38.724
J.D., don't come up in here
with all that shit today, okay?

57:38.748 --> 57:39.892
We don't have time for that shit.

57:39.916 --> 57:41.000
- Okay?
- Mabel.

57:41.167 --> 57:43.711
What did I ask you to do?
More of this. More parsley.

57:43.878 --> 57:45.713
<i>Okay? You? You better hurry it up!</i>

57:45.880 --> 57:47.817
Okay, I don't even know why
he got a goddamn hairnet on.

57:47.841 --> 57:50.051
He don't even have no hair.
You guys are tripping!

57:50.218 --> 57:51.445
- That's good.
<i>- Lord have mercy.</i>

57:51.469 --> 57:53.149
More flour. Put some more.
Don't be scared.

57:53.179 --> 57:54.305
You didn't buy it!

57:54.472 --> 57:55.741
<i>It's gotta be out of here by 2:00.</i>

57:55.765 --> 57:56.766
You have a break yet?

57:56.933 --> 57:58.268
Knead it, knead it! Knead it

57:58.434 --> 58:00.145
like you knead a bitch's ass. Okay?

58:00.311 --> 58:01.813
- Come on! Hmm?
- Mabel.

58:01.980 --> 58:03.374
What happened to us
giving them a break, huh?

58:03.398 --> 58:04.399
For what?

58:04.607 --> 58:06.043
We've got to keep the talent healthy.

58:06.067 --> 58:08.862
- Negro, I'm the talent.
- Oh!

58:09.028 --> 58:11.531
You got me twisted on there,
talking about the talent.

58:11.698 --> 58:13.908
You ain't doing shit out there
worth a damn...

58:14.075 --> 58:16.244
You may be the talent, but I'm the face.

58:16.411 --> 58:17.745
<i>All right?</i>

58:19.747 --> 58:20.748
Look, Nana...

58:20.915 --> 58:25.211
We don't want this gravy train
to stop flowing anytime soon.

58:26.754 --> 58:28.047
Look at that, hmm?

58:29.007 --> 58:30.717
That's just from this morning.

58:31.801 --> 58:33.428
Talent! You all take five.

58:33.595 --> 58:34.637
Go.

58:34.888 --> 58:36.389
Talent, take six.

58:36.848 --> 58:37.849
Hmm?

58:40.476 --> 58:42.103
<i>I know it seems like a lot.</i>

58:42.270 --> 58:43.938
But we just asking for two days.

58:45.106 --> 58:46.774
Two days and no bloodshed.

58:46.983 --> 58:48.151
Exactly, gentlemen.

58:48.318 --> 58:50.361
Not to oversell it,
but what's gonna happen is,

58:50.528 --> 58:51.755
<i>you guys go home for the weekend,</i>

58:51.779 --> 58:53.323
<i>and all your friends on Friday</i>

58:53.489 --> 58:55.283
will still be alive come Monday morning.

58:56.784 --> 58:58.077
It's not a bad deal.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.126
Oh...

59:05.460 --> 59:06.628
Why'd I do that?

59:06.794 --> 59:08.630
Look, all we trying to say, man, is,

59:09.589 --> 59:11.883
<i>we got sons, I know y'all got kids,</i>

59:12.050 --> 59:15.511
and we just trying to make sure
our kids get to their 18th birthday.

59:15.678 --> 59:17.138
And 19th and 20th.

59:17.388 --> 59:19.474
<i>And it gotta start somewhere, man.</i>

59:19.641 --> 59:23.269
And we say it starts here
this weekend for two days.

59:24.062 --> 59:25.480
<i>But we need y'all.</i>

59:26.022 --> 59:27.482
<i>Y'all the shot callers.</i>

59:28.066 --> 59:30.485
We just need y'all to call some shots.

59:51.923 --> 59:53.299
I'm in.

59:54.842 --> 59:56.803
Because of you, Cal.

59:57.887 --> 59:59.389
Appreciate it, man.

01:00:06.062 --> 01:00:07.188
I got you.

01:00:10.817 --> 01:00:11.818
All right, everybody,

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.611
<i>we're good to go this weekend.</i>

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:15.488
All right, there we go.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.782
- Let's get ready.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:20.201
Hey, thanks for taking care
of me earlier, Rashad.

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.662
- I really appreciate it.
- We all good.

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:24.455
And...

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.041
Thanks for giving me
a ride home the other night.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.044
You were a real gentleman, Shady-Shad.

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:37.093
<i>So you took the bitch home.</i>

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:39.679
Look, she needed a ride home
so I gave her a ride home.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:40.930
I'm a good dude.

01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:43.826
It was nighttime, she was by herself.
I wasn't gonna leave her out there.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.619
It's crazy out there.
What else was I supposed to do?

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.061
Draya works in a barbershop.

01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:49.581
There were plenty of other good dudes
who could've taken her home.

01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:50.765
Why'd you have to be the one?

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.025
Because it was on the way.

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:53.192
Bullshit!

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:54.652
I know girls like Draya.

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:57.238
I see through her fake lashes,
and her watermelon ass,

01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:59.240
and her whole damsel-in-distress routine.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:00.825
She wants you, Rashad.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:03.161
Are you dumb enough
to fall into that girl's trap?

01:01:03.328 --> 01:01:04.370
Terri...

01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:06.247
You come home every other night

01:01:06.456 --> 01:01:08.666
from some video shoot
or some athlete's commercial.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.209
Do I ever question it?

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.378
No, because I trust you.

01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:14.714
I know you hold me down,
I'm holding you down.

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:16.841
I don't care, I don't like that bitch.

01:01:17.342 --> 01:01:19.135
Look, I promise you...

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:21.971
I promise you, there's nothing
going on with me and Draya.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.723
I need you to know that, okay?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.727
- Pull your pants down.
- What?

01:01:27.894 --> 01:01:29.079
Pull your pants down, we're doing it.

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:30.414
What the hell are you doing, girl?

01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:32.106
Stepping up my lazy side booty game.

01:01:32.273 --> 01:01:33.353
- Let's go.
- Yo, chill out.

01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:34.641
- Be quiet.
- I am being quiet.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:35.693
You're gonna wake her up.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.421
I don't care, we can be quiet. Let's go.

01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:38.605
Chill out! Chill out! Look...

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:41.313
We ain't having sex on demand,
I ain't no piece of meat.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:42.909
- "Let's go." Look...
- Whatever.

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:45.286
Get up in it.

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:49.123
Get up in it. Now!

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.793
I mean...

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:54.128
I am aroused though, I ain't gonna lie.

01:01:54.629 --> 01:01:56.964
But I got this sofrito sauce
on the stove, I'll be back.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.717
What? You're just proving my point!

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:02.303
And your sofrito sauce
don't taste better than me!

01:02:06.224 --> 01:02:07.642
You're not going nowhere.

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:09.936
Not this weekend.

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:12.730
It's too crazy out there on them streets.

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.792
But, Dad, there's a three-on-three
tournament this weekend!

01:02:14.816 --> 01:02:16.651
I don't care about no basketball.

01:02:16.818 --> 01:02:20.154
Do you know your mama found
gang paraphernalia in your drawer?

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.490
In my house!

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:24.182
Now how am I supposed to trust you?

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:25.827
Man, this ain't fair!

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:28.287
None of my team has gotta deal
with these stupid rules!

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:30.123
You know why? Do you know why?

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:31.833
Because most of those knuckleheads

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.936
ain't even got a father
to look out for them anyway.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.294
But they look out for me.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.131
When I'm at school,
my boys are the ones that got my back.

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:40.425
Who you talking about?
You talking about Kenny?

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.260
You think that's your boy?

01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:44.767
Why you always gotta say
something about Kenny?

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.071
Aren't you and Uncle Shad like brothers?

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:48.808
- Why you always tripping?
- Hey!

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:50.268
You watch your mouth, Jalen!

01:02:50.685 --> 01:02:52.854
Now, I'm not one of your friends, okay?

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:56.190
I don't see why you don't understand
how dangerous it is out there

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:59.193
and that we don't approve of
who you're associating with!

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.839
What? You want me to hang out
with the cornball that cleans the shop?

01:03:01.863 --> 01:03:02.947
What's wrong with Anthony?

01:03:03.114 --> 01:03:05.032
Why is it corny to be smart?

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:07.326
Why is it corny to do what you're asked?

01:03:07.702 --> 01:03:10.037
Why is it corny to handle your business?

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:12.999
That's not corny, son.
That's being a man.

01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:20.006
Look, J... I know you're mad.

01:03:20.173 --> 01:03:21.382
I know you're upset.

01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:23.050
But listen,

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:26.220
you gotta realize how lucky you are
to have two parents

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:28.307
that wanna know where you are,
what you're doing,

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:30.016
who you're associating with.

01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:31.225
That's important.

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:32.894
You're lucky.

01:03:34.145 --> 01:03:35.730
I don't feel lucky.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:39.025
My life would be so much
better if you wasn't in it.

01:03:39.192 --> 01:03:40.401
What? What'd you say? Jalen!

01:03:40.568 --> 01:03:42.212
- Did you hear him?
- Baby, please wait! Hey!

01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:43.321
Hey, boy!

01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:44.572
Did you hear what he said?

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.049
I know, but listen, he didn't mean it!

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:48.242
He's angry and he's 14.

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:50.411
Well, I'm angry and I'm older than 14.

01:03:50.578 --> 01:03:52.330
- Boy, you ain't white!
- Okay, babe...

01:03:52.497 --> 01:03:54.916
Listen, at some point, he's gonna realize

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.002
that we're doing all of this
because we love him.

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.920
- But he's not a tough guy.
- I know.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:01.589
He's trying to act like it.
Boy, you not a tough guy!

01:04:01.756 --> 01:04:03.216
Hey, I know that.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.927
South Side's no place to flex.

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:10.097
You ain't got it like that,
you need to ease back

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.600
'cause the consequences
out here are way too thin.

01:04:12.767 --> 01:04:15.561
I know, but clearly,
he's going through something.

01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:19.106
But you and me? We raised a smart kid.

01:04:19.774 --> 01:04:21.275
He's gonna turn around.

01:04:21.442 --> 01:04:22.568
Trust me.

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:25.947
Hope so.

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:31.118
<i>Unlike New York and LA,
there has been a spike</i>

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.581
<i>in the number of homicides
in Chicago in the last year.</i>

01:04:35.748 --> 01:04:38.209
You think anybody who's not
a regular will show up?

01:04:38.376 --> 01:04:40.461
Yeah, everyone likes free shit.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:43.756
That's not exactly what
we're doing this for though.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:45.609
You really think
the neighborhood's gonna agree

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:47.385
to be peaceful for two days?

01:04:47.552 --> 01:04:49.762
I can't think of the last time
we went two hours

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.973
without gunfire popping off around here.

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:54.141
We gonna make it happen this weekend.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.935
So what? What happens after that?

01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:57.812
The enclosure just magically stops?

01:04:57.979 --> 01:05:01.649
Exactly. It ain't like politicians
really listen to the people anyway.

01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:03.126
<i>So we're gonna make them listen.</i>

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:06.112
The shop staying open
depends on the success of this ceasefire

01:05:06.279 --> 01:05:07.405
and how much press we get.

01:05:07.572 --> 01:05:09.652
Check this out.
I already created a Twitter campaign.

01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:11.409
#BarbershopSavesTheNeighborhood.

01:05:11.576 --> 01:05:13.953
Now, look, we get a few
celebrities to tweet that out,

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.162
we'll go viral in no time.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:16.330
I'll tell you what.

01:05:16.497 --> 01:05:19.125
If you can get this to be
a trending topic on Twitter,

01:05:19.292 --> 01:05:20.602
I'll vote Democrat the next election.

01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:21.627
Deal.

01:05:21.794 --> 01:05:23.671
This just got very interesting.

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.464
- What up, everybody?
- Yo-yo.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.425
- Am I early or late?
- Both.

01:05:27.592 --> 01:05:28.676
My man.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.639
Come on.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:37.351
I don't think we should.
What do you think?

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:39.580
Made him get in the game injured, man.

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:41.522
That's why we
couldn't do nothing last week.

01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:43.858
Head must tilt a certain way.

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:45.192
I'm just fond of shit.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.861
Uh, I like that.

01:05:47.028 --> 01:05:48.904
<i>I'll set that down there.</i>

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:50.215
<i>Thank you! Appreciate it.</i>

01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:52.366
<i>Thank you for the work.
Appreciate it.</i>

01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:07.006
This is low as I can go really.

01:06:07.173 --> 01:06:09.133
I can't go much lower than this now.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:11.510
- Is this decaf?
- Uh, yeah, cold brew's for me.

01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:12.720
Good looking out, A.

01:06:12.887 --> 01:06:14.305
Yeah, no problem.

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:17.350
All right, my man. Thanks for coming.

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:18.796
- Yo, who next?
- I got you, Cal.

01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:28.402
There you go.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.571
<i>How is it out there?</i>

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.032
Streets is quiet, feels good.

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:35.177
It's actually starting to feel
a little normal.

01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:36.577
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:37.953
All right, ma.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.205
Bye, Anthony-Shmanthony.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.502
Girl, I know.

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:47.981
That was probably crazy.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.674
<i>Bitch, we've been in here 17 hours.</i>

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.384
<i>You know, I am half delirious.</i>

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:52.694
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:54.318
<i>So what'd he say?</i>

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.430
Angie, do you wanna get that?

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:00.744
<i>- Stop, Tewana, stop!</i>
- What the fuck?

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.019
I'm the owner today?

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.940
Calvin's shop, Bree speaking.

01:07:06.107 --> 01:07:07.501
<i>May I speak to Calvin, please?</i>

01:07:07.525 --> 01:07:09.276
Yeah, one second. Calvin, it's for you.

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:10.444
Who is it?

01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:12.613
I'm sorry, may I ask who's calling?

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.448
<i>- It's me, girl!</i>
- Oh.

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:17.118
Why you acting all business like?
It's One-Stop.

01:07:19.453 --> 01:07:20.955
I'll answer it in the back.

01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:23.767
Yeah, he's gonna take it in the back.

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:24.792
<i>Oh, it's like that?</i>

01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:26.119
That's gross.

01:07:31.382 --> 01:07:33.634
Yo, Raja, let me get
some of that spray, G.

01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:35.612
I had to get mine in the back,
like everybody else,

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:37.555
so what makes you so special, "G"?

01:07:37.722 --> 01:07:39.522
- You a vic, man.
<i>- Say that to my face.</i>

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:41.368
<i>Come on back and say it to my...
Don't! No, don't.</i>

01:07:41.392 --> 01:07:42.768
No, no, stop being mean, Rashad.

01:07:42.935 --> 01:07:44.145
<i>Stop!</i>

01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:46.147
Oh, shit!

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.315
- Shit! That's dope!
- Yeah!

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:50.526
- Yo, you...
- You hooked it up!

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:53.070
One-Stop, why didn't you just
call me on my phone?

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.799
<i>B, your cell number's
in my old phone. I got a new Galaxy.</i>

01:07:55.823 --> 01:07:57.968
It isn't even out yet, man.
It's not even on the market.

01:07:57.992 --> 01:07:59.076
People don't have it yet.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.470
<i>Has everything on this bad boy...</i>

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:02.496
Satellite radio, holographic video,

01:08:02.663 --> 01:08:04.832
surround sound, 5G.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:06.333
<i>Man, this phone is the only phone</i>

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.061
<i>that's, like, five minutes
ahead of every call.</i>

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:09.646
So, I already talked to your ass already!

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:11.672
- Dude, shut up!
<i>- It's crazy!</i>

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:13.007
Damn. Now what's going on?

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:15.277
Look, I got a Italian couple
here that's hot on this place.

01:08:15.301 --> 01:08:16.301
<i>- They love it!</i>
- Who?

01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.229
They wanna open a yogurt spot
or a yoga spot.

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.139
What's the issue? What'd you call me for?

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:21.307
Are we good or not?

01:08:21.474 --> 01:08:22.908
<i>Because if you're
thinking about backing out...</i>

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:24.327
I'm not thinking about backing out.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.350
Now, I told you,
me and my wife, we want that shop.

01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:29.482
All right, man <i>. Oui, oui.</i>
I'll see you Monday.

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:31.192
And that's French.

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:33.819
Dumbass.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:40.826
Hey, what's up?

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:42.536
What's up?

01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.162
You good?

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:46.540
I'm straight.

01:08:58.219 --> 01:08:59.696
We rolling out
with the rest of the family

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.013
from Holy City tomorrow.

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:03.557
Y'all still down, right?

01:09:03.724 --> 01:09:05.225
<i>- Hell, yeah.</i>
- Yeah, probably.

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:12.899
This nigga said probably?

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:14.734
No, we down for sure.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:20.991
Y'all little niggas better be.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.577
Because if you in this,
you in this for life.

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:26.705
But you know that, though, right, Kenny?

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:29.250
Yeah, I know what's up.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:32.586
Yeah, all right.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.587
We gonna see.

01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:39.877
I'm gonna give you the shake
tomorrow, too, youngster.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.428
That's right.

01:09:49.854 --> 01:09:50.854
I'm not stalking you,

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.482
I'm just getting something for my clients.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.235
Uh, Draya, I want to
talk to you anyway, 'cause...

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.404
You know what? The other night...

01:09:58.571 --> 01:09:59.947
That was my fault.

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.448
I was tripping.

01:10:01.782 --> 01:10:04.118
And I hope we good.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.372
I forgive you, Rashad.

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:13.794
Hey, who wants some chicken wings?

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.463
And I got some homemade banana pudding
from BJ's Market.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:17.756
Nice!

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.885
Is this gluten-free, Terri?

01:10:24.138 --> 01:10:25.264
Hey, what you doing now?

01:10:25.431 --> 01:10:27.975
You're saying no,
but that's not what you mean, Rashad.

01:10:28.142 --> 01:10:29.560
That is what I mean.

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:30.954
I knew I wasn't tripping the other night.

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:32.455
- No, you weren't.
- You tripping right now.

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:33.480
<i>Rashad!</i>

01:10:36.775 --> 01:10:38.152
Shad, you back here?

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:41.572
Shad!

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.492
<i>Babe.</i>

01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:47.578
Shad, you back here?

01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:49.306
- You be quiet.
- You be quiet!

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.331
No, no!

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.791
<i>Where you at?</i>

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:55.252
Oh, man.

01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:56.962
Babe, you in the bathroom?

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:22.363
Hi, Terri.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:24.865
No, baby. I'm tellin' you, we did nothing.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:26.426
- Get off me!
- There was nothing happening!

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.493
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.012
- I need you to listen to me!
- Do not touch me!

01:11:29.036 --> 01:11:31.538
I'm listening, I'll listen!
I'll listen! I'm listening.

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.545
- It ain't what you think...
- Okay, all right!

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:35.542
Hey, what's going on?

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:38.295
<i>Draya, stop!
Calvin, help me on this!</i>

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:39.797
Get off me!

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:42.758
- Wait a minute!
- Let me get at her!

01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:44.009
Get off me!

01:11:44.176 --> 01:11:45.344
- Baby!
- Rashad, get off me!

01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:46.696
<i>Baby, you gotta chill.
Nothing happened.</i>

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.888
Calvin, help me!

01:11:48.055 --> 01:11:49.223
World Star fight!

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:50.557
No, no World Star.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:51.952
I need you
to listen to me for a second.

01:11:51.976 --> 01:11:53.018
Leave me alone!

01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:55.479
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.191
Calm down. I need you to calm down.

01:12:05.698 --> 01:12:07.199
You ain't even worth it.

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:18.919
Go get her.

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:23.590
<i>Cal,</i>

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:26.427
<i>do we still have those cameras
in the back?</i>

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:28.345
I told you not to take those down.

01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:30.764
We could've had the shop's first sex tape.

01:12:31.098 --> 01:12:32.659
<i>- Whatever!
- Terri. Terri, come on.</i>

01:12:32.683 --> 01:12:33.827
- I know what I saw.
- Come on, Terri.

01:12:33.851 --> 01:12:34.995
- Hey, Terri, come on.
- I know what I saw.

01:12:35.019 --> 01:12:36.579
- I need you to talk to me.
- I knew it!

01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:37.872
- Whatever! I knew it.
- You have to listen to me.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:40.733
I knew it. I should've never trusted you
or that skank-ass ho!

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:43.944
Look, why would I mess around with Draya
in the same shop you work at?

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.338
- I'm smarter than that!
- Whatever!

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:46.442
I don't care what happened!

01:12:46.572 --> 01:12:48.049
You should've never let it get that far.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:49.616
You made her think she could!

01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:51.410
Why do you even talk to her anyway?

01:12:51.744 --> 01:12:52.745
I don't know!

01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:54.955
It's because... Look, she talked to me.

01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:56.623
You don't be talking to me, I talk!

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:58.910
She asked me how I'm doing,
she asked what's going on!

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.544
- Where you at?
- Where I'm at!

01:13:00.711 --> 01:13:02.463
I'm working, for us, for our family!

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:04.882
This ain't about work,
I'm talking about us.

01:13:05.049 --> 01:13:06.091
Me and you.

01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:08.469
I'm talking about me and you for real.
Look at me.

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:12.639
Baby, look, look.

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.309
I tell you, you look beautiful every day.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.478
I say that because I mean it,

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.563
and I want you to know that I see it,

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.482
because I love you, I care about you.

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:23.984
You sound like a real bitch right now.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:27.321
Look, I ain't gonna be too many bitches.

01:13:27.905 --> 01:13:28.906
Straight up.

01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:31.837
Now, if you wanna have
a real conversation,

01:13:31.992 --> 01:13:33.577
we have a real conversation.

01:13:35.162 --> 01:13:37.831
But you ain't gonna never
call me a bitch again.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:42.669
I don't have nothing else to say to you.

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:47.424
I'm out.

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:52.304
Go on then.

01:13:56.141 --> 01:13:57.267
Damn.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:59.269
For all that, I should have smashed.

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:06.693
<i>Good afternoon, everybody!</i>

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:08.671
<i>Folks coming home from church
are getting ready</i>

01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:10.197
<i>for their Sunday dinner. Mmm!</i>

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:11.990
<i>It's a lazy quiet day...</i>

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:13.301
<i>It's your girl, Terri. Leave it.</i>

01:14:13.325 --> 01:14:14.511
<i>...and that's a good thing for once.</i>

01:14:14.535 --> 01:14:16.930
<i>Stay with us, I got some of your requests
coming up momentarily.</i>

01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:18.594
<i>All right, I'm good. Thank you!</i>

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.637
You got something you wanna say?

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:35.532
You know what,
women like you are the reason

01:14:35.556 --> 01:14:37.516
why women like me
can't find a decent man.

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:38.684
Excuse me?

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.052
Bree, this is not the time...

01:14:40.102 --> 01:14:41.538
Don't be mad at me because you can't

01:14:41.562 --> 01:14:43.230
- get a man or keep a man!
- Draya...

01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:45.708
With all the single dudes in the world,
you just gotta be a married man's ho?

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:46.876
Is that your thing? Is that what you do?

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.044
Yo, you better get your girl.

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:49.212
You just break up a healthy relationship?

01:14:49.236 --> 01:14:50.380
You gotta get your girl.

01:14:50.404 --> 01:14:51.756
- You better get her now!
- Ladies! Ladies, listen.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.716
<i>- I'm dead serious.</i>
- Don't nobody wanna hear all that!

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.702
Now, if y'all wanna fight, fuss and cuss,
you take it to the back.

01:14:56.869 --> 01:14:58.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Cal, this is not <i>Fight Club.</i>

01:14:58.704 --> 01:15:00.515
You can't send ladies
to the back room to fight.

01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:03.083
You gotta sign a waiver
and a release of liability.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.353
If they start fighting in that
back room and tear shit up,

01:15:05.377 --> 01:15:06.420
<i>I'm telling you, man,</i>

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:08.857
<i>it's gonna come back on your insurance.
That's a deductible.</i>

01:15:08.881 --> 01:15:10.817
And I do dental work, too,
if it gets out of hand.

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:11.842
<i>Okay, come see me.</i>

01:15:12.009 --> 01:15:13.093
Man, shut up, One-Stop.

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.554
Look, I don't wanna take sides here,

01:15:15.721 --> 01:15:17.764
but does anybody else here
see the hypocrisy

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:20.767
in always blaming
the single woman for the affair?

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:23.228
<i>I mean, let's be honest,
she wasn't the one</i>

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:25.939
who swore to be honest and to be faithful

01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:29.109
<i>and not cheat in the back room
of the barbershop</i>

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:31.111
until I'm dead. It was him.

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:33.947
How many times I gotta say
ain't nothing happened?

01:15:34.114 --> 01:15:35.407
Yeah, nothing happened.

01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:37.075
But I'm not gonna spend every day

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:40.871
explaining myself to you, you, or you!

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:44.625
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically, okay?

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:47.711
It is shameful society always
blames the other woman

01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:49.296
when they should be blaming him.

01:15:49.463 --> 01:15:50.631
<i>Listen, doofus...</i>

01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:53.050
Monogamy doesn't run in our DNA.

01:15:53.217 --> 01:15:54.801
- You understand that?
- What?

01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:56.094
You can't defy science.

01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:57.888
That is ridiculous, that is bullshit.

01:15:58.055 --> 01:15:59.556
<i>Women want sex, too.</i>

01:15:59.723 --> 01:16:03.310
And you don't see us lying and cheating,
and going out buying sports cars.

01:16:03.477 --> 01:16:05.312
You're just a weak-ass man, Dante.

01:16:05.479 --> 01:16:06.813
Honestly, it's as simple as that.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.148
Yeah, okay and I'll be that.

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:11.818
A weak-ass man with a sports car
and a gaggle of bitches.

01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:13.445
In real life.

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:15.530
Ew, y'all ain't shit, man.

01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:17.324
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.

01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:19.326
Don't lump us all in there.

01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:21.286
You know,
men aren't just looking to cheat.

01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:24.456
That's like saying every woman
wants a big package.

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:25.999
<i>Because it's just not true.</i>

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.335
They do, they all want a big package.

01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:30.170
I know I do.

01:16:30.337 --> 01:16:31.940
Honestly, I thought
that it was more about

01:16:31.964 --> 01:16:34.341
passion and love, and, like,
how you guys connected...

01:16:34.675 --> 01:16:35.759
<i>I mean, I have...</i>

01:16:36.051 --> 01:16:37.678
I believe he's gay.

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:39.680
Like that? Like that?

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.348
<i>I'm a real man.</i>

01:16:41.515 --> 01:16:42.875
I don't feel like I need to cheat.

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:44.226
Now that's just a lie.

01:16:44.685 --> 01:16:46.496
<i>Because if Halle Berry came
walking in right now</i>

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.040
and offered you them drawers,
you trying to tell me you wouldn't

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:50.833
take her in the back
and just bed her down?

01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:53.193
Hell, no. Halle Berry crazy as hell.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.861
From <i>Monster's Ball?</i>

01:16:55.946 --> 01:16:59.199
"I want you to just make me feel good."

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:00.492
No.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.160
You crazier than she is.

01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.371
I like them crazy.

01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:06.206
Like one-eye open crazy.

01:17:06.373 --> 01:17:08.333
Like gotta hide your wallet crazy.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.668
Solange crazy.

01:17:09.835 --> 01:17:11.503
Kick me, bitch, in the elevator.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.213
- Man, that's...
- Shut up!

01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:21.430
I can't wait to give her this D.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.932
Ooh. He crazy there. This one.

01:17:24.099 --> 01:17:25.183
Now that's dangerous.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:26.910
<i>Well, look, maybe it's just me.</i>

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.437
I'm a romantic.

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:29.883
One woman is good enough for me.

01:17:30.022 --> 01:17:32.783
<i>Yeah, what's going on, everybody?
I wanna send a special shout-out</i>

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:34.085
<i>to Calvin's Barbershop
over on the South Side.</i>

01:17:34.109 --> 01:17:35.110
Hey!

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:37.197
<i>They're right in the midst
of a 48-hour ceasefire</i>

01:17:37.237 --> 01:17:39.031
<i>- to increase the peace.
- Doing it.</i>

01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:41.426
<i>- Keep it going, y'all.
- Hey, did y'all hear that?</i>

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.677
Did y'all hear my name on the radio?

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:44.501
- It's all right.
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:47.659
All right, that's dope, but it's still not
a trending topic on Twitter, okay?

01:17:47.748 --> 01:17:49.082
Don't matter.

01:17:49.249 --> 01:17:51.251
- Because this is my shit.
- Mmm...

01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:52.711
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:52.878 --> 01:17:55.756
I'm dancing, in a non-gay way.

01:18:00.927 --> 01:18:01.928
Turn that up!

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:11.438
Bring it on, Eddie! Bring it on.

01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:15.586
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

01:18:22.449 --> 01:18:23.492
Go, Calvin!

01:18:59.945 --> 01:19:01.279
Rashad, baby!

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:23.510
Hey, what's up, Terrence?

01:19:23.677 --> 01:19:27.055
Did you come to get a cut, man,
or are you here to see Eddie twerk?

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:28.807
- No, no, no, no!
- You don't talk!

01:19:28.974 --> 01:19:30.016
Come on, Eddie! Show him!

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:31.463
You know ain't I do no twerking!

01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:35.188
<i>Eddie, come on, you can twerk.</i>

01:19:36.648 --> 01:19:38.400
Uh, look, listen, guys, um...

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.571
There was a shooting on 26th and King

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:44.457
<i>- just a few minutes ago.</i>
- Oh, man! Really?

01:19:45.866 --> 01:19:47.659
It was Anthony Clark.

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:50.078
- What?
- Wait, our Anthony?

01:19:50.245 --> 01:19:51.413
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:19:57.919 --> 01:19:58.962
What happened?

01:19:59.379 --> 01:20:00.857
He was walking home from the library.

01:20:00.881 --> 01:20:02.048
<i>He died on the scene.</i>

01:20:02.215 --> 01:20:03.925
There was nothing any of us could do.

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:07.345
Oh, God.

01:20:09.389 --> 01:20:10.469
<i>Calvin...</i>

01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.564
<i>I didn't come here to bring
anybody down, okay?</i>

01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:15.598
I'm really proud of the work
you guys are doing here.

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.331
<i>I mean, all the progress
you've made with the shop...</i>

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:18.732
Progress?

01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:21.234
What progress, man?

01:20:22.194 --> 01:20:24.112
I mean, what are you talking about?

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.074
A kid just died.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:29.576
A mother's child...

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:32.245
A father's child is dead.

01:20:32.412 --> 01:20:33.580
One of the best ones we got.

01:20:34.206 --> 01:20:35.248
Yeah.

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:37.918
That ain't no progress.

01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:40.170
That's failure!

01:20:41.546 --> 01:20:43.924
Nothing we've done has worked.

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.009
We just wasting our time.

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:48.386
These kids ain't gonna listen to us.

01:20:48.553 --> 01:20:50.764
These kids, they like to kill each other.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.432
<i>They like that shit.</i>

01:20:52.599 --> 01:20:54.351
<i>We crazy to think that</i>

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:56.436
haircuts can stop bullets.

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.231
Man, this is the fucking South Side.

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:02.067
This ceasefire shit is over. It's over.

01:21:02.234 --> 01:21:03.443
Calvin, come on, now.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.111
It's over, man!

01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:06.404
Calvin.

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.716
Calvin, we made a commitment
to see this thing through.

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.450
I don't give a damn about no commitment!

01:21:10.617 --> 01:21:11.785
What commitment?

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.119
Huh?

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:15.010
The commitment of them
killing each other?

01:21:16.456 --> 01:21:18.083
They ain't got no commitment to us!

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:21.086
Look, I feel terrible about
what happened to Anthony.

01:21:21.253 --> 01:21:22.295
We all do.

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:24.631
That's the reason that
we have to keep going

01:21:24.798 --> 01:21:25.966
now more than ever.

01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:28.885
How can you give up like this?

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:30.303
Because that's what he do.

01:21:31.805 --> 01:21:33.056
He already had planned to

01:21:33.223 --> 01:21:35.141
open up a shop on the North Side.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.628
That's what he put money down on.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:41.189
Is that right, Cal?

01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:43.567
<i>You already plan to leave us behind.</i>

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.486
Calvin.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:51.408
Calvin, is that true?

01:21:53.285 --> 01:21:54.869
Look.

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:56.413
I'm a father first.

01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.581
Oh, my God.

01:21:57.789 --> 01:21:59.666
Y'all gotta realize that. Okay?

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:00.959
I got a son, too, man.

01:22:01.126 --> 01:22:03.169
Okay, you take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:05.839
Now y'all depend on me
to do a few things,

01:22:06.006 --> 01:22:08.091
but Jalen depends on me to do everything.

01:22:08.258 --> 01:22:10.176
And I'm not about to leave him out here

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.345
in these streets
to get hurt for you, you,

01:22:12.512 --> 01:22:13.638
or this damn shop!

01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:16.266
None of us have ever asked you
not to be a father!

01:22:16.433 --> 01:22:17.934
None of us!

01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:21.354
We are here because of fathers
like you and sons like Jalen,

01:22:21.521 --> 01:22:23.023
and you didn't even tell us?

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:26.943
We get up every single day
and we work beside you!

01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:29.487
We're supposed to be your friends!

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:32.866
I am your partner!

01:22:33.033 --> 01:22:34.492
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:36.178
I was gonna say something
after the ceasefire.

01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:38.242
- Man, that's bullshit.
- No, that's some real shit.

01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:39.432
<i>You weren't gonna tell us</i>

01:22:39.456 --> 01:22:40.641
'cause you ain't care
about what we think.

01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:42.500
- What?
- You sold us out, man.

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:45.086
I didn't sell nobody out, man.
I've been here for years!

01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:47.881
Y'all are the only reason
I come to this damn shop!

01:22:48.048 --> 01:22:50.300
I've been wanting
to leave here years ago!

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.552
<i>I'm just trying to do better, man.</i>

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:55.055
That's it! For my family!

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:56.973
If you can't understand that, I'm sorry.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.225
- I'm sorry, but I'm out!
- Wait, Calvin. Come on.

01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:00.786
- Let's talk...
- No. I'm gone. I'm out!

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:02.896
Calvin! Calvin?

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:16.910
Thanks. Appreciate it.

01:23:32.342 --> 01:23:33.843
What do you say, Eugene?

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:35.720
<i>Hey, hey, what's up, Big Eddie?</i>

01:23:35.887 --> 01:23:37.698
Why don't you give me
a double shot of Hennessy?

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:39.766
- You got it, boss.
- Yep.

01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.894
You got some of those wasabi nuts?

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:50.193
Eddie, if you came in here
on some <i>Ol' Man River</i> shit,

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.960
trying to tell me what kind of fool I am

01:23:52.112 --> 01:23:53.446
for moving the shop,

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:54.739
I don't want to hear it.

01:23:55.115 --> 01:23:58.284
Well, I might as well just
take my drink to go then.

01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:00.912
Go on. Put that in a plastic cup.

01:24:02.956 --> 01:24:05.083
I'm gonna be real with you, Cal.

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:07.711
I came in here to say,

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:09.254
thank you.

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:13.258
Now, I ain't want
to say this in front of everybody,

01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:14.592
but you right.

01:24:14.759 --> 01:24:17.971
Selling the shop is the best
thing for your family,

01:24:18.138 --> 01:24:20.598
and the perfect excuse for me to get out.

01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:21.975
Go on and retire.

01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:24.436
Retire? You?

01:24:25.937 --> 01:24:28.148
Thought you'd die before
you left that shop, Eddie.

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:29.441
Yeah.

01:24:29.607 --> 01:24:33.570
I ain't dying in that old
raggedy-ass unisexual shop.

01:24:33.737 --> 01:24:34.821
What...

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:37.073
I can't even recognize
that place no more.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.241
Hell...

01:24:38.408 --> 01:24:40.827
I don't even recognize
the neighborhood no more.

01:24:40.994 --> 01:24:42.328
Yeah.

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:44.914
Got that right.

01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:47.250
All the more reason

01:24:47.584 --> 01:24:50.587
for you to just go on over
there to the North Side.

01:24:58.636 --> 01:24:59.916
I know what you're doing, Eddie.

01:25:01.014 --> 01:25:02.682
It's not easy, man.

01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:05.351
Hell, no, it ain't easy. Hell, no.

01:25:06.186 --> 01:25:08.438
We black. It's hard.

01:25:08.605 --> 01:25:11.316
Hard and us go hand in hand.

01:25:11.858 --> 01:25:13.610
But we ain't never gave up.

01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:15.195
I didn't give up.

01:25:15.779 --> 01:25:17.030
I gave out.

01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:19.324
I'm tired, Eddie.

01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:22.118
I'm tired, too.

01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:24.037
We've been up 38 hours.

01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:35.840
Anthony's gone.

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:40.053
And that hurts like hell.

01:25:40.804 --> 01:25:45.517
But we done lost a whole bunch more
if we didn't do that ceasefire.

01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:47.852
Now we lost one.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:50.063
He was special.

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:54.567
But we probably saved
more lives than we know.

01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:58.571
And for that reason alone is
reason to keep up the fight.

01:26:05.078 --> 01:26:06.830
- What's good, bro?
- Yo.

01:26:08.748 --> 01:26:09.749
I can't do this, man.

01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:10.917
What?

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:12.210
I gotta walk away.

01:26:12.377 --> 01:26:14.188
So you just gonna leave me
out here with Yummy alone?

01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:16.172
I ain't leave you nowhere, man.

01:26:16.339 --> 01:26:17.619
You ain't got to do this either.

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:19.484
Can't believe you doing this to me, yo.

01:26:20.927 --> 01:26:21.928
What?

01:26:22.095 --> 01:26:24.848
Look, my dad let me move
in with him and Terri.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.174
They've been real cool to me.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.559
I don't want to hear that, man.

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:29.102
J, what are you thinking?

01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:31.104
I mean, look at what you have here.

01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:32.939
Everything you need is right here.

01:26:33.106 --> 01:26:35.441
You got a moms, you got a dad.

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:36.943
I'm not doing this.

01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:39.279
If you were smart, you'd do the same.

01:26:58.256 --> 01:26:59.591
Do I need to check the closet?

01:27:00.925 --> 01:27:02.385
You been gone all of this time,

01:27:02.552 --> 01:27:04.470
<i>ain't answered none of my messages</i>

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:06.431
and you come here playing.

01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:12.645
I'm sorry.

01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:15.440
I don't wanna fight.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.486
With everything going on
right now, with Anthony,

01:27:21.154 --> 01:27:22.614
<i>we shouldn't be like this.</i>

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:24.574
I agree.

01:27:27.744 --> 01:27:29.829
And I'm sorry about that Draya mess.

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:31.581
Nothing happened.

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.881
But I shouldn't have
put you in that position.

01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:37.503
I know nothing happened.

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:39.964
You're just an idiot.

01:27:42.008 --> 01:27:43.801
I'm just a man, baby.

01:27:45.178 --> 01:27:46.679
I get it.

01:27:48.014 --> 01:27:50.183
And I know I've been working a lot.

01:27:52.685 --> 01:27:54.771
But I need you to know

01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:58.274
that I see everything you do.

01:27:59.359 --> 01:28:02.028
You're an amazing man, Rashad.

01:28:02.195 --> 01:28:04.197
You're an amazing father to Maya.

01:28:05.114 --> 01:28:07.951
I could never ask for
a better partner than you.

01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:11.537
I guess I just figured

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.707
you knew how I felt.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.376
I do.

01:28:17.377 --> 01:28:19.712
But sometimes a brother needs to hear it.

01:28:22.799 --> 01:28:24.509
One-Stop, can you sign this?

01:28:24.676 --> 01:28:26.386
No doubt.

01:28:26.552 --> 01:28:28.888
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:31.975
<i>Oh, this is crazy, man.</i>

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:34.060
<i>Bree, you wanna sign the card?</i>

01:28:34.227 --> 01:28:35.895
<i>Yo, Jerrod, check it out.</i>

01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:40.066
<i>Hey, what's up, everybody?</i>

01:28:40.233 --> 01:28:42.235
Before y'all pack up your stuff,

01:28:42.402 --> 01:28:44.237
<i>can I talk to you for a minute?</i>

01:28:48.199 --> 01:28:49.742
Just real quick.

01:28:53.913 --> 01:28:56.541
Go on in now, say what you gotta say.

01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:01.254
I was wrong.

01:29:03.423 --> 01:29:05.717
<i>The reason I wanted to end the ceasefire</i>

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:09.512
is the same reason why I
wanted to move the shop to the North Side.

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:13.349
Man, I was hurt.

01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:15.768
Disappointed.

01:29:17.937 --> 01:29:19.605
<i>But y'all know me.</i>

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:22.942
Y'all know I got love for the South Side.

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:28.197
I got love for everybody
in this neighborhood.

01:29:29.741 --> 01:29:32.118
I got love for everybody in here.

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.620
<i>All my customers,</i>

01:29:35.455 --> 01:29:37.915
even the ones that don't know
how to go home.

01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.171
What?

01:29:44.255 --> 01:29:45.715
Are y'all gonna play me like that?

01:29:47.133 --> 01:29:49.135
So after a while, it just...

01:29:49.302 --> 01:29:51.929
It just became easier to just walk away.

01:29:52.722 --> 01:29:54.432
<i>Walk away from all this pain.</i>

01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:56.934
All the hurt.

01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:00.646
That ain't right either.

01:30:01.731 --> 01:30:04.734
<i>If we don't do something for
this neighborhood, who will?</i>

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:07.653
<i>At the end of the day
we can't expect people</i>

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:10.990
who don't know nothing about
what's going on around here,

01:30:11.157 --> 01:30:13.910
to come in here and solve our problems.

01:30:15.995 --> 01:30:18.122
We gotta fix our problems ourself.

01:30:19.957 --> 01:30:21.834
So what are you saying, Calvin?

01:30:22.627 --> 01:30:24.837
I'm saying I wanna continue
what we started.

01:30:25.338 --> 01:30:28.174
<i>I want to put the ceasefire
back on for the neighborhood.</i>

01:30:28.341 --> 01:30:29.801
For Anthony...

01:30:31.469 --> 01:30:32.845
And really for us.

01:30:33.346 --> 01:30:36.516
<i>But I'm only one half
of the leadership here, so,</i>

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:38.851
I'm gonna need the support of my partner

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:41.854
before the ceasefire's
officially back on.

01:30:42.021 --> 01:30:43.815
Calvin, you never lost my support.

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:44.982
You know, I'm here.

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:47.193
<i>I appreciate your vote of confidence,</i>

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.760
but I think Angie is the one you...

01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:50.196
Shh! You're good. You're good.

01:30:50.363 --> 01:30:52.723
- Oh, Angie is the one you're speaking to.
- Now you got it.

01:30:52.782 --> 01:30:54.534
<i>I totally misread the situation.</i>

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:55.743
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:58.204
So what you say, Ange?

01:30:59.539 --> 01:31:00.706
Look...

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:05.586
<i>I just...</i>

01:31:07.213 --> 01:31:10.216
I just can't understand why people
are still standing around

01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:12.718
when my partner just said
the ceasefire is back on.

01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.721
<i>Yes!</i>

01:31:16.389 --> 01:31:17.640
<i>Ooh, bait and switch.</i>

01:31:17.807 --> 01:31:19.267
Thank you so much.

01:31:20.393 --> 01:31:21.769
- All right.
<i>- Let's do this.</i>

01:31:21.978 --> 01:31:22.979
<i>Oh, yes, yes!</i>

01:31:23.146 --> 01:31:26.149
<i>- That's good stuff right there.</i>
- Yes, sir. Good stuff.

01:31:26.315 --> 01:31:27.567
- Sorry about that.
- Nah.

01:31:27.775 --> 01:31:28.985
<i>Let's celebrate!</i>

01:31:29.986 --> 01:31:31.737
Yo. Can a brother get a cut around here?

01:31:32.697 --> 01:31:33.698
Damn!

01:31:33.865 --> 01:31:35.199
Hey, D, what's up, man?

01:31:35.366 --> 01:31:37.446
<i>- How you doing?
- Doing good now.</i>

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.888
I'm Calvin. This is my shop, man.
What can we do for you?

01:31:39.912 --> 01:31:40.952
Playing the Bulls tomorrow

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.040
and got a tweet from somebody
named thottiepimpin

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:45.007
about what y'all are doing
here and everything

01:31:45.084 --> 01:31:46.228
and just came here
to show my support, man.

01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:47.253
Cool.

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.588
Who's thottiepimpin?

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:49.922
That one right there.

01:31:50.089 --> 01:31:51.174
What's up, man?

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.884
- How you doing, man?
- I'm doing.

01:31:53.050 --> 01:31:54.927
- Just a second.
- You all right?

01:31:55.094 --> 01:31:56.429
You okay?

01:31:56.596 --> 01:31:58.431
Sorry, A.D. Sorry. He's got issues.

01:31:58.598 --> 01:31:59.765
This was a mercy hire.

01:31:59.932 --> 01:32:01.267
Just give the man some space.

01:32:01.434 --> 01:32:03.227
- Hey. How ya doing?
- What's up, man?

01:32:03.394 --> 01:32:04.580
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

01:32:04.604 --> 01:32:06.772
- All right, bro. Keep growing.
- High five.

01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:08.524
Okay, come on, young man.

01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:10.610
Sit on down. Come on in here.

01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:12.904
Let me line that unibrow a little.

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:14.113
Give it a soft fade,

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.716
and then I'll cut
right through the middle there

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.782
and open it up for you.

01:32:17.617 --> 01:32:18.951
Nobody's touching my unibrow.

01:32:19.118 --> 01:32:20.286
And no disrespect,

01:32:20.453 --> 01:32:22.014
I'm gonna let my man
Calvin over here hook me up.

01:32:22.038 --> 01:32:23.348
<i>- All right.

01:32:23.372 --> 01:32:24.516

- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Everything all right?

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:27.627
All right. Question...

01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:29.605
- You looking for a roommate?
- No, I'm all good, man.

01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:30.963
- You sure?
- Positive.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.381
I got my stuff. I'm all ready.

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:33.901
<i>We ain't got to make a stop or nothing.</i>

01:32:33.925 --> 01:32:35.569
- All right. Cool, man.

01:32:35.593 --> 01:32:36.969
- You say yes?
- No, I said...

01:32:37.136 --> 01:32:38.447
All right. Okay. All right, okay. Cool.

01:32:38.471 --> 01:32:39.847
Don't do it.

01:32:40.014 --> 01:32:41.200
- Sorry about that, man.
- It's all good, man.

01:32:41.224 --> 01:32:42.451
- You know how they act.
- Yeah.

01:32:42.475 --> 01:32:43.869
Question. You mind if
I get a picture for Twitter?

01:32:43.893 --> 01:32:44.894
Yeah, for sure, man.

01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:46.288
Tag me in it, too, so I can retweet it.

01:32:46.312 --> 01:32:49.232
Man! That would be...
That would be dope, man.

01:32:49.398 --> 01:32:50.399
Hey, man, hurry up.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.526
<i>Hey, Jerrod, get out the man's face.</i>

01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:53.694

Don't worry about nothing, man.
Your unibrow is safe with me.

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:03.858

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:46.278
four, three, two...

01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:47.738
One!

01:37:47.905 --> 01:37:49.615
Yeah!

01:37:53.369 --> 01:37:54.969
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.664
<i>Yeah, baby! All right!</i>

01:38:01.877 --> 01:38:03.420
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:04.773
- Bam!
- Your daddy gonna be proud.

01:38:04.797 --> 01:38:06.117
Your dad will be so proud of you.

01:38:06.257 --> 01:38:07.400
- You did a good job.
- I feel good.

01:38:07.424 --> 01:38:08.467
I feel good.

01:38:09.969 --> 01:38:11.929
Hey, yo, Shad. Hey, man!

01:38:12.137 --> 01:38:14.306
Much love, dude.
I'm sorry about everything.

01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:16.850
- I love you, boy.
- I love you, bro. Love you.

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:18.310
Wow.

01:38:18.519 --> 01:38:20.479
Two black dads getting along.

01:38:30.823 --> 01:38:31.865
Let me ask you something.

01:38:32.074 --> 01:38:35.160
Um, I don't come off as gay, do I?

01:38:35.327 --> 01:38:38.038
I mean, I've heard that,
like, twice already today.

01:38:38.205 --> 01:38:40.374
No.
Now, do I think that you could

01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:43.627
maybe afford to own one less
pastel-colored T-shirt

01:38:43.794 --> 01:38:45.355
and go up a size in the jean department?

01:38:45.379 --> 01:38:46.880
Yes, absolutely.

01:38:47.047 --> 01:38:48.507
But who cares?

01:38:48.674 --> 01:38:50.509
Clothes don't signify someone's sexuality.

01:38:50.676 --> 01:38:52.177
And even if you were gay...

01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:54.888
I'm not. For the record. I'm not.

01:38:55.055 --> 01:38:57.224
It wouldn't matter to me anyway.

01:38:57.391 --> 01:39:00.519
I like who you are and you shouldn't feel
pressured to change for anybody.

01:39:00.728 --> 01:39:02.688
And there's no rules on
how to be a straight dude.

01:39:02.855 --> 01:39:03.856
Look at Miguel.

01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:05.149
Look at Prince.

01:39:05.316 --> 01:39:07.693
Homeboy be rocking
six-inch stilettos and a perm,

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.861
and he can still get it.

01:39:09.028 --> 01:39:10.029
Yes, he can.

01:39:11.238 --> 01:39:13.073
I'm messing with you.
Playing the whole...

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.533
- That's...
- Anyway.

01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:17.786
So, you like my personality?

01:39:19.163 --> 01:39:22.041
What can I say?
I find your neuroses entertaining.

01:39:22.666 --> 01:39:25.711
Your passion for
women's rights liberating.

01:39:26.253 --> 01:39:27.254
And, um...

01:39:29.632 --> 01:39:31.258
I find your nerdiness

01:39:31.425 --> 01:39:33.218
incredibly sexy.

01:39:36.096 --> 01:39:37.181
Wow.

01:39:38.265 --> 01:39:39.892
Talking to me?

01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:41.894
And that's why I like you.

01:39:42.061 --> 01:39:43.062
Because you get me.

01:39:43.562 --> 01:39:46.190
Not a lot of people do,
but you definitely do.

01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:48.734
And just so you know, Ronnie, your ex,

01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:51.403
he was never good enough for you.

01:40:03.415 --> 01:40:04.792
I think I'm in love with you.

01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:07.252
And I want to shout it from the rooftops.

01:40:07.878 --> 01:40:09.588
- Oh... Too soon?
- Yeah.

01:40:09.797 --> 01:40:11.477
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:13.759
I mean... What'd you hear?
You heard that I said

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:15.761
- I was in love with you?
- No.

01:40:16.053 --> 01:40:17.054
Rewind that.

01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:18.365
How about dinner tomorrow night?

01:40:18.389 --> 01:40:19.429
- Okay.
- That makes sense.

01:40:19.556 --> 01:40:20.557
Yeah. That's...

01:40:20.766 --> 01:40:22.366
I went from a broken home,

01:40:22.393 --> 01:40:24.645
- so I give affection very fast.
- Oh, my Lord. My Lord.

01:40:24.812 --> 01:40:26.480
Yeah. Yeah.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.067
You got a lot of nerve showing up here.

01:40:30.609 --> 01:40:32.945
- I came to apologize, Terri.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:40:33.112 --> 01:40:34.738
Well, I wanna say it anyway.

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.868
Listen, I'm really sorry.

01:40:40.577 --> 01:40:42.457
I should have never come
between you and Rashad.

01:40:42.579 --> 01:40:43.914
Damn right.

01:40:44.164 --> 01:40:46.625
It's just that you have your
whole life taken care of,

01:40:46.792 --> 01:40:48.419
and figured out. And...

01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:51.672
I'm like, still trying to figure out
every little thing about mine.

01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:55.008
I made a mistake.

01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:57.803
It'll never, ever happen again.
I promise you that.

01:40:59.096 --> 01:41:00.305
Well...

01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:02.975
I appreciate you saying that.

01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:05.436
Does that mean we're cool?

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:08.355
I guess.

01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:09.648
Come here, girl!

01:41:13.444 --> 01:41:14.445
Anyway...

01:41:14.611 --> 01:41:17.156
I did want to tell you
that if you and Rashad

01:41:17.322 --> 01:41:19.616
was looking for, like,
a third girl to help you out,

01:41:19.783 --> 01:41:21.660
you know, get it poppin'
or anything like that,

01:41:21.827 --> 01:41:23.036
I would be down for that.

01:41:23.287 --> 01:41:24.496
Mull it over.

01:41:24.788 --> 01:41:25.789
- Bye, Draya.
- Hey, hey.

01:41:25.956 --> 01:41:27.040
Hey, hey, hey.

01:41:27.207 --> 01:41:28.876
We need to at least hear her out now.

01:41:29.042 --> 01:41:30.794
I mean, she ain't
come this way for nothing.

01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:32.605
- Hey, Rashad!
<i>- What's good, Draya?</i>

01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:33.669
- Get in the house.
- Baby.

01:41:33.797 --> 01:41:35.597
<i>You think it's funny.
You're not funny.</i>

01:41:35.674 --> 01:41:36.834
Thanks.

01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:40.679
This is not what you think it is.

01:41:41.513 --> 01:41:43.393
This is that bird I talked about.
Remember that?

01:41:43.474 --> 01:41:44.475
It went away.

01:41:46.018 --> 01:41:48.187
It flew away. Let 'em fly.

01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:54.818
Know why I came back?

01:41:54.985 --> 01:41:56.695
- Why?
- Because you my man.

01:41:57.154 --> 01:41:58.238
I came back to you.

01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:00.133
Why don't you just give me the damn check?

01:42:00.157 --> 01:42:01.200
My man.

01:42:01.408 --> 01:42:02.493
That's your section.

01:42:02.659 --> 01:42:04.161
- No booth rent.
- We're clear?

01:42:04.328 --> 01:42:05.329
Do you.

01:42:05.496 --> 01:42:06.936
My man. It's a pleasure, my brother.

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.665
<i>You will do good business, my brother.</i>

01:42:08.832 --> 01:42:10.042
You have a good day!

01:42:10.209 --> 01:42:12.085
Hit these streets. Oh! Hey! Hey!

01:42:12.252 --> 01:42:15.005
I need to talk to you.
You got to sign some paperwork, brother.

01:42:15.172 --> 01:42:16.715
<i>Your wife trying to find you.</i>

01:42:16.882 --> 01:42:18.675
<i>You're gonna run from me, really?</i>

01:42:22.179 --> 01:42:23.597
Yo, man, we closed.

01:42:23.764 --> 01:42:24.890
Come back tomorrow.

01:42:25.057 --> 01:42:26.558
Man, that's too bad.

01:42:29.394 --> 01:42:31.563
I was really hoping you could fit me in.

01:42:33.398 --> 01:42:35.067
I think I got room for one more.

01:42:40.739 --> 01:42:42.241
Have a seat.

01:42:47.246 --> 01:42:49.331
Glad you came, man.

01:42:49.581 --> 01:42:52.751
Just wanted to do something about this
so-called abomination you say.

01:42:54.086 --> 01:42:55.963
I'll hook you up,
don't worry about nothin'.

01:42:56.213 --> 01:42:58.215
Edge you up real quick.

01:42:58.757 --> 01:43:01.093
Uh... I was thinking,

01:43:01.301 --> 01:43:02.761
start off fresh.

01:43:08.267 --> 01:43:09.309
You sure?

01:43:10.561 --> 01:43:11.562
Positive.

01:43:13.438 --> 01:43:14.439
All right.

01:43:14.606 --> 01:43:15.899
Start you off fresh.

01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:19.278
You know, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

01:43:20.279 --> 01:43:22.447
You've always been there
for me for everything,

01:43:22.614 --> 01:43:23.991
and I appreciate it.

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:27.452
Love you, Dad.

01:43:28.453 --> 01:43:29.872
I love you, too, man.

01:43:30.622 --> 01:43:31.999
Always gonna be my guy.

01:43:32.249 --> 01:43:33.333
I swear.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:38.171
All right. Let's see how
we can hook you up here.

01:43:39.172 --> 01:43:40.632
Yeah, okay.

01:43:41.341 --> 01:43:42.509
Now, listen...

01:43:42.968 --> 01:43:44.511
I hear about anything,

01:43:44.678 --> 01:43:46.447
I'm snatching you right up
out of there, you hear me?

01:43:46.471 --> 01:43:48.223
- Yeah, I hear you.
- I'm not playing.

01:43:48.432 --> 01:43:50.142
Be up there quick fast in a hurry.

01:43:50.309 --> 01:43:53.770
I escort you to the bathroom
and everything if I have to.

01:43:56.356 --> 01:43:57.774
Crazy, Dad.

01:43:57.941 --> 01:43:59.610
But I'm fine with that.

01:43:59.776 --> 01:44:02.154
I'm just happy to stay here.
Happy to be home.

01:44:04.197 --> 01:44:05.574
I'm happy you back.

01:44:05.824 --> 01:44:07.492
See me hooping this year, right?

01:44:07.659 --> 01:44:09.661
You got to penetrate more.
Too many jumpers.

01:44:09.828 --> 01:44:10.988
But they go in though.

01:44:11.038 --> 01:44:12.640
Not all
the time, they don't go in.

01:44:12.664 --> 01:44:14.166
Oh, man...

01:44:15.542 --> 01:44:17.687
You don't wanna rock
your dreads like that, man?

01:44:17.711 --> 01:44:20.591
Now if you end up on the Bulls,
your daddy got to go everywhere with you.

01:44:20.714 --> 01:44:22.434
I'm gonna be the team barber.

01:44:22.925 --> 01:44:23.926
Damn, man.

01:44:24.134 --> 01:44:25.427
All right.

01:44:25.802 --> 01:44:26.922
Slow down.

01:44:27.304 --> 01:44:28.305
Hey.

01:44:28.555 --> 01:44:31.516
You ain't comb your hair in six months,
it's a little nappy down there.

01:44:31.683 --> 01:44:34.353
All kind of cucabugs back here. Beebees.

01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:35.896
You gonna be all right.

01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:39.524
Yeah. That's it.

01:44:41.276 --> 01:44:42.277
Oh.

01:44:43.487 --> 01:44:45.030
Look fresh.

01:44:46.198 --> 01:44:48.241
Now you look like my son again.

01:44:48.742 --> 01:44:50.535
I'm getting all the shorties
at school now.

01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:52.371
Yeah.

01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:54.247
Now you can sweep up the hair.

01:44:56.249 --> 01:44:57.751
<i>Dear Chicago,</i>

01:44:57.918 --> 01:45:00.087
<i>I know I was hard on you before,</i>

01:45:00.253 --> 01:45:01.713
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.161
<i>If there's one thing I know about you,</i>

01:45:04.549 --> 01:45:06.760
<i>is that you know how to bounce back.</i>

01:45:07.552 --> 01:45:11.515
<i>And we salute
Chicago's own South Side Champs.</i>

01:45:14.893 --> 01:45:15.936
Chicago, stand up.

01:45:16.103 --> 01:45:17.562
Chicago, stand up.

01:45:17.729 --> 01:45:20.107
We want them to believe in themselves.

01:45:20.273 --> 01:45:22.234
<i>We want them to believe
in their community.</i>

01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:24.569
<i>We want them to believe
that they have a future.</i>

01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:26.947
We are college bound.
We are exceptional.

01:45:27.114 --> 01:45:29.408
Not because we say it,
but because we work hard at it.

01:45:29.574 --> 01:45:31.326
Hey! Congratulations, Miss Paxton.

01:45:35.414 --> 01:45:39.710
<i>You've always taken personal
tragedy and turned it into triumph.</i>

01:45:40.085 --> 01:45:41.128
No, don't do it...

01:45:41.545 --> 01:45:43.088
Give me that!

01:45:43.255 --> 01:45:44.756
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>
- No, no, no!

01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:46.633
- Breaking down like LeBron!
- Oh.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.343
- Know that. Know that.
- Yeah.

01:45:49.428 --> 01:45:51.114
<i>That's why
I'm not giving up on you.</i>

01:45:51.138 --> 01:45:53.015
There we go. This what we running.

01:45:53.724 --> 01:45:56.059
<i>Because you never gave up on me.</i>

01:46:00.439 --> 01:46:01.648
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:02.232 --> 01:46:04.276
- Who won? Who won?
- Boom, every time.

01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:06.236
Mr. Wilson!

01:46:09.823 --> 01:46:12.159
<i>And I know whatever happens,</i>

01:46:12.451 --> 01:46:13.910
<i>eventually,</i>

01:46:14.077 --> 01:46:15.495
<i>Chicago,</i>

01:46:15.829 --> 01:46:18.123
<i>you'll find your way back home.</i>

01:46:18.457 --> 01:46:20.125
<i>You always do.</i>

01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:24.087
What's up?

01:46:27.841 --> 01:46:30.135
Yeah, who won? What's the real story?

01:46:30.302 --> 01:46:31.511
What's the real story?

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:33.346
Who won? Who won?

01:46:34.806 --> 01:46:36.433
<i>Let's just stick to cutting hair, right?</i>

01:46:41.313 --> 01:46:43.774
<i>What can
the people of Chicago take away from this?</i>

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:47.152
It's a reminder that the individual,
or, in this case, individuals,

01:46:47.319 --> 01:46:48.487
can make a big difference.

01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.322
<i>As a former barber in the shop,</i>

01:46:50.489 --> 01:46:52.467
<i>- it's been very inspiring...</i>
- Is that Jimmy James?

01:46:52.491 --> 01:46:53.634
<i>...for me to see the people of community</i>

01:46:53.658 --> 01:46:54.802
<i>come together and show the world</i>

01:46:54.826 --> 01:46:56.506
<i>that there's still hope on the South Side.</i>

01:46:56.661 --> 01:46:58.705
<i>- Mr. James!
- Ms. Cruz.</i>

01:46:58.872 --> 01:47:00.641
<i>In light
of the success of the ceasefire,</i>

01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:02.810
<i>have you personally changed
your mind about the enclosure,</i>

01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:05.670
<i>and do you think it'll have any effect
on the upcoming council vote?</i>

01:47:05.837 --> 01:47:06.880
Go ahead, Jimmy.

01:47:07.047 --> 01:47:08.483
<i>Well, I can't speak for the council,</i>

01:47:08.507 --> 01:47:11.468
<i>but I'd be shocked if they voted yes,
when so many have voted against it.</i>

01:47:12.010 --> 01:47:13.196
<i>See, the whole point of the enclosure</i>

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:14.980
<i>was to decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

01:47:15.013 --> 01:47:16.653
<i>And I think that
Mr. Palmer and Ms. Norris</i>

01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:17.682
Oh!

01:47:17.849 --> 01:47:18.993
<i>and the rest of the team down at the shop</i>

01:47:19.017 --> 01:47:20.685
<i>found a way to do just that.</i>

01:47:21.103 --> 01:47:22.343
<i>- That's right!
- Whoo!</i>

01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:23.811
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:47:27.734 --> 01:47:29.528
Dad! You see this?

01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:32.882
- Man, that's got to...
<i>- No, it ain't.</i>

01:47:32.906 --> 01:47:34.032
Oh! Serious?

01:47:34.199 --> 01:47:35.239
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:47:35.367 --> 01:47:36.701
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:47:36.868 --> 01:47:38.912
- Hey, everybody!
- Hell, no.

01:47:39.079 --> 01:47:40.348
It's good to see you.

01:47:40.372 --> 01:47:41.516
- How are you?
- Mr. President.

01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:42.683
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

01:47:42.707 --> 01:47:43.851
<i>I like that sharp suit.</i>

01:47:43.875 --> 01:47:45.353
- Hey, I'll get you one.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:47:45.377 --> 01:47:46.521
<i>- Gotcha.
- Okay.</i>

01:47:46.545 --> 01:47:48.380
Mr. President, how you doing, sir?

01:47:48.547 --> 01:47:51.424
You know, it's good to be back
where it all started for me.

01:47:51.675 --> 01:47:52.717
The South Side.

01:47:52.884 --> 01:47:54.803
- I told you.
- Hey, Eddie!

01:47:55.554 --> 01:47:57.794
Very good to see you. Good to see you.

01:47:58.056 --> 01:47:59.242
Take that jacket off.

01:47:59.266 --> 01:48:00.725
- Should I say hi?
- Yeah.

01:48:00.892 --> 01:48:02.012
- Hi!
<i>- How you doing?</i>

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.300
Have a seat right there.

01:48:05.021 --> 01:48:06.582
I was telling these kids
how I used to cut

01:48:06.606 --> 01:48:08.584
- your hair back in the day.
- You sure did.

01:48:08.608 --> 01:48:10.168
You was running around here organizing.

01:48:10.235 --> 01:48:11.546
You know, I gotta get a picture of this.

01:48:11.570 --> 01:48:13.047
- Calvin, take this picture.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:48:13.071 --> 01:48:14.406
Bam!

01:48:14.573 --> 01:48:16.950
How you doing, Mr. President?
My name's Calvin.

01:48:17.117 --> 01:48:18.702
I own the shop with Angie right here.

01:48:18.869 --> 01:48:19.870
- I'm Angie. Hi.
- Yeah.

01:48:20.036 --> 01:48:21.180
<i>We appreciate your small business.</i>

01:48:21.204 --> 01:48:23.081
Hey, Mr. President.
New Democrat right here.

01:48:23.248 --> 01:48:24.791
All right! Congratulations!

01:48:26.293 --> 01:48:27.478
Stop acting all nervous, Eddie.

01:48:27.502 --> 01:48:28.938
You know you know what you're doing.
Come on, man.

01:48:28.962 --> 01:48:31.399
I cut the man's hair years ago.
I know what I'm doing right here.

01:48:31.423 --> 01:48:32.424
Um...

01:48:32.591 --> 01:48:34.050
Mr. President, I just want to say,

01:48:34.217 --> 01:48:36.777
you know, I really love what you've done
for the black community.

01:48:36.803 --> 01:48:38.597
<i>All right.
And I'm loving those pants.</i>

01:48:38.763 --> 01:48:40.724
- Oh, thank you.
- Appreciate your patriotism.

01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:42.267
I salute you, too.

01:48:43.935 --> 01:48:45.437
Barry. Come on, now.

01:48:45.604 --> 01:48:46.605
I'm sorry.

01:48:46.771 --> 01:48:49.232
Okay, here we go. Low like you always do?

01:48:49.399 --> 01:48:50.959
Come on, now, hook your man up.

01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:52.944
- Little bit.
- Are you shaking, Eddie?

01:48:53.153 --> 01:48:54.713
Eddie, you got it.

01:48:54.738 --> 01:48:56.281
Come on, Eddie. Represent now.

01:49:02.162 --> 01:49:03.288
<i>Eddie!</i>

01:49:03.622 --> 01:49:05.123
One-Stop,

01:49:06.082 --> 01:49:07.459
you got some salve?

01:49:08.627 --> 01:49:10.253
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.630
<i>Sit back down!</i>

01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:41.071
