WEBVTT

00:01.586 --> 00:06.206
PREVIOUSLY ON "CELEBRITY BIG
BROTHER"!

00:06.241 --> 00:10.241
THE MOMENTS INTO THE GAME
TODRICK, SHANNA, CYNTHIA AND

00:10.275 --> 00:13.827
CARSON FORMED A FOUR SOME.

00:13.862 --> 00:19.206
BUT TODRICK SWITCHED HIS

00:19.241 --> 00:22.068
LOYALTIES TO MIESHA HOH IS A.

00:22.103 --> 00:22.965
MIESHA.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.448
I THINK WE WOULD MAKE A GREAT
FINAL 2.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.551
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

00:26.586 --> 00:31.965
I WILL RIDE THIS THING UNTIL
THE WHEELS FALL OFF.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.137
THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER ROSE TO
POWER AGAIN.

00:34.172 --> 00:35.241
HERE WE GO.

00:35.275 --> 00:38.206
LOOK WHO WON THE SECOND HOH,
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

00:38.241 --> 00:40.137
AND HE IS WANTED TO TAKE
CARSON OUT.

00:40.172 --> 00:43.655
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, CARSON,
AND YOU, CYNTHIA.

00:43.689 --> 00:49.620
CARSON HAS BEEN IN MY SITES
AND I THINK THIS IS THE WEEK I

00:49.655 --> 00:51.551
CAN TAKE TAKE HIM OUT OF THIS
GAME.

00:51.586 --> 00:56.344
IT WAS REINDEER GAMES FOR THE
VETO, AND SHANNA SLADE THE

00:56.379 --> 00:57.241
COMPETITION.

00:57.275 --> 00:57.862
YOU.

00:57.896 --> 00:58.689
SLAYED THE COMPETITION.

00:58.724 --> 01:02.034
YOU WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO.

01:02.068 --> 01:05.206
GUESS WHO WON THEIR SECOND
VETO?

01:05.241 --> 01:06.448
I DID.

01:06.482 --> 01:11.896
WITH KIRKPATRICK AND SHANNA
ALIGNED WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:11.931 --> 01:14.448
HOUSE THEY DECIDED TO DRAW A
LINE IN THE SAND AND SAVE

01:14.482 --> 01:15.275
CARSON.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.206
DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE CARSON
OUT?

01:16.241 --> 01:17.413
YES.

01:17.448 --> 01:20.000
WE COULD PLAY IT SAFE AND
JUST KEEP THE NOMINATION IT IS

01:20.034 --> 01:23.172
SAME, BUT DO WE REALLY WANT TO
DO THAT OR DO WE WANT TO SHAKE

01:23.206 --> 01:24.344
THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT?

01:24.379 --> 01:28.206
SO AT THE VETO MEETING --
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE

01:28.241 --> 01:30.379
POWER OF VETO ON CARSON.

01:30.413 --> 01:32.000
THANK YOU.

01:32.034 --> 01:36.034
THE FORMER MS. USA GAVE
CARSON SOME GOLDS.

01:36.068 --> 01:39.344
I WANT THIS BACK, IT IS ONLY
ON LOAN.

01:39.379 --> 01:42.275
FORCING MIESHA TO PUT A NEW
KID ON THE BLOCK.

01:42.310 --> 01:47.241
I NO, SIR, NOMINATE YOU,
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.517
AT THE LIVE EVICTION THE
HOUSE SAVED CYNTHIA.

01:50.551 --> 01:56.206
BY A VOTE OF 5-0, CHRIS, YOU
ARE EVICTED FROM THE BIG BROTHER

01:56.241 --> 01:57.206
HOUSE.

01:57.241 --> 02:01.482
AND SENT CHRIS TO SAY, HI,
HI, HI TO JULIE.

02:01.517 --> 02:07.862
AND THEN WITH ONLY SEVEN
REMAINING A BATTLE OF ENDURANCE

02:07.896 --> 02:08.689
BEGINS.

02:08.724 --> 02:10.758
WHO WILL TWO FROM POWER TO
POWER?

02:10.793 --> 02:14.793
AND WHICH TWO HOUSE GUESTS WILL
HIT THE BLOCK?

02:14.827 --> 02:18.275
PLUS IT IS SUNDAY NIGHT SUPER
SHOWDOWN YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING

02:18.310 --> 02:19.413
FOR.

02:19.448 --> 02:21.862
PREPARE TO BE BOLD OVER WITH
HARD-HITTING HOUSE DRAMA.

02:21.896 --> 02:23.965
YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED TO
--

02:24.000 --> 02:25.586
WANTED TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS,
ABSOLUTELY.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.862
BUT YOU WERE WORKING WITH US.

02:27.896 --> 02:29.137
IT IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

02:29.172 --> 02:31.620
SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T WANT TO
MISS THIS, NO MATTER WHAT GAME

02:31.655 --> 02:33.379
MIGHT BE ON ANOTHER CHANNEL.

02:33.413 --> 02:39.862
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW, ONLY ON
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER"!

03:36.620 --> 03:41.034
TIME FOR A LITTLE CATCH UP.

03:41.068 --> 03:43.896
THAT HIT IN THE CROTCH!

03:43.931 --> 03:45.517
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE.

03:45.551 --> 03:46.172
IT WENT IN MY MOUTH.

03:46.206 --> 03:52.172
THAT HIT ME IN THE NANIE.

03:52.206 --> 03:53.448
AH!

03:53.482 --> 03:58.034
SO I KNOW THERE IS THIS OTHER
SPORTS THING TODAY WITH A

03:58.068 --> 04:01.068
FABULOUS CONCERT IN THE MIDDLE
BUT THINGS ARE REALLY HEATING UN

04:01.103 --> 04:01.827
HERE.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.310
THERE IS A FULL ON WAR
HAPPENING.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.206
IT IS A HOUSE DIVIDED.

04:05.241 --> 04:10.137
QUEUE HAVE GOT MY TEAM, MIESHA
AND CYNTHIA, VERSUS THE OTHER

04:10.172 --> 04:13.413
TEAM, TODD, TODRICK, MIESHA AND
LAMAR.

04:13.448 --> 04:17.965
I PERSONALLY THINK WE HAVE
BETTER UNIFORMS.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.034
MY RIDER DIED OUT OF THE
HOUSE, I AM REALLY FEELING ALONE

04:22.068 --> 04:23.206
IN THIS GAME.

04:23.241 --> 04:26.275
MIESHA CAN'T COMPETE IN A
COMPETITION, BUT THE MIESHA

04:26.310 --> 04:27.379
MAFIA CAN.

04:27.413 --> 04:30.551
AND I AM NOT COMING OFF THIS
WALL UNTIL THEY GO DOWN.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.896
THERE IS A LIVING NIGHTMARE
FOR ME.

04:33.931 --> 04:38.137
NOT ONLY DID MY PLAN TO GET
CARSON OUT OF THE HOUSE

04:38.172 --> 04:41.517
COMPLETELY BACKFIRE, IT IS LIKE
WHEN I COMPETE, I REALLY NEED

04:41.551 --> 04:46.482
ONE OF MY GUYS FROM THE ALLIANCE
TO PULL THROUGH.

04:46.517 --> 04:54.137
AS LONG AS I WIN, CARSON
WINS, OR SHANNA WINS, I AM GOOD.

04:54.172 --> 04:59.000
NOW, THE THREE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T
WIN THIS THING, LAMAR ODOM,

04:59.034 --> 04:59.862
TODRICK AND TODD.

04:59.896 --> 05:02.965
HELLO, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT DOWN
THERE?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.137
THEY ARE DEFINITELY RIDING
WITH MIESHA.

05:05.172 --> 05:12.413
YOU ARE USED TO SEEING RED
BUT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE PINK.

05:12.448 --> 05:16.206
OH, MY GOD!

05:16.241 --> 05:18.034
NO WAY!

05:18.068 --> 05:18.965
THIS IS MY COLOR.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.620
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

05:22.655 --> 05:27.206
I WON'T LIE, I LOOK GOOD IN
PINK, SOMEBODY GOT THE MEMO BUT

05:27.241 --> 05:31.103
THIS IS SLIPPERY AS WELL AND
MAKING IT REALLY, REALLY HARD

05:31.137 --> 05:33.034
FOR ME TO HOLD ON TO THESE BARS.

05:33.068 --> 05:36.379
I LOOK GOOD IN PINK BUT IT
WON'T BE CUTE AT ALL IF I FALL

05:36.413 --> 05:36.827
OFF.

05:36.862 --> 05:37.275
THAT SUCKED.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.586
IT SURE DID.

05:38.620 --> 05:43.482
GETTING GLAM IS A BIG PART OF
MY LIFE, I HAVE AN AMAZING GLAM

05:43.517 --> 05:46.793
SQUAD, THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF
GLAM.

05:46.827 --> 05:47.517
WITH MY MOUTH.

05:47.551 --> 05:52.482
YOU GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC.

05:52.517 --> 05:55.034
HEY, BRO.

05:55.068 --> 05:57.448
NO, DON'T.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.448
COME ON, GOOD JOB, GUYS.

05:59.482 --> 06:03.206
HOLDING ON TO THIS CHAIR IS
REALLY HARD.

06:03.241 --> 06:06.172
THIS IS MENTAL TORTURE TO ME.

06:06.206 --> 06:10.275
I AM SIX-10 BUT AFRAID OF
HEIGHTS.

06:10.310 --> 06:16.517
LOOK OUT, THEY ARE BACK AND
THEY BROUGHT THE HAIRSPRAY.

06:16.551 --> 06:19.689
OH, SUGAR.

06:19.724 --> 06:25.068
COME ON, LIFT ME UP.

06:25.103 --> 06:27.379
GOOD JOB, LAMAR, THAT WAS

06:27.413 --> 06:28.517
ABOUT GOOD JOB.

06:28.551 --> 06:30.620
LAMAR, IS THE FIRST ONE OUT.

06:30.655 --> 06:33.655
LAMAR DROPPING FIRST REALLY PUTS
A HOLE IN MYSELF.

06:33.689 --> 06:36.482
I WAS HOPING HE COULD HANG ON A
LITTLE LONGER.

06:36.517 --> 06:39.758
NOW I AM BASICALLY DOWN TO TODD
AND TODRICK TO WIN THIS.

06:39.793 --> 06:44.517
WHICH NO OFFENSE, THE I LOVE YOU
TODD BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS WE

06:44.551 --> 06:45.000
ARE DOWN TO TODRICK.

06:45.034 --> 06:45.827
OKAY.

06:45.862 --> 06:47.551
I CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER.

06:47.586 --> 06:50.413
YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT
IT.

06:50.448 --> 06:55.724
I AM HOLDING ON FOR DEAR
LIFE, BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN HOH.

06:55.758 --> 06:59.068
I HAVE PRETTY GOOD LEG STRENGTH
BUT MY ARMS, NOT SO MUCH.

06:59.103 --> 07:02.724
I HAVE GOT TO GO.

07:03.413 --> 07:08.448
OH, AND CYNTHIA IS DOWN.

07:08.482 --> 07:12.413
CYNTHIA IS DOWN BECAUSE SHE
NEVER PUT UP WITH THIS KIND OF

07:12.448 --> 07:15.827
TREATMENT FROM HER GLAM SQUAD SO
THAT MEANS IT IS UP TO ME AND

07:15.862 --> 07:19.482
SHANNA TO GET THIS HOH WIN FOR
OUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

07:19.517 --> 07:21.620
IT IS GO TIME.

07:21.655 --> 07:26.482
HIS NAIL BITER NEEDS MORE
NAIL POLISH.

07:26.517 --> 07:29.689
.. OH!

07:29.724 --> 07:32.482
DANG IT!

07:32.517 --> 07:37.931
OH, GOD!

07:37.965 --> 07:43.482
MY MAKE-UP ARTIST IS FURIOUS
IF SHE THROWS NAIL POLISH ALL

07:43.517 --> 07:47.000
OVER ME AND IT MAKES IT SO
DIFFICULT TO HOLD ON TO THESE

07:47.034 --> 07:47.724
BARS.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.034
IT IS DRINK AND IT IS FREEZING.

07:49.068 --> 07:52.172
I AM LITERALLY JUMPING UP AND
DOWN TO GET MY BODY TEMPERATURE

07:52.206 --> 07:52.793
UP.

07:52.827 --> 07:54.413
IT IS A CRY FOR CARSON.

07:54.448 --> 07:56.448
IT IS HAPPY FRIDAY.

07:56.482 --> 08:04.034
HAPPY --
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO

08:04.068 --> 08:05.758
THAT HAIRSTYLIST BUT THEY ARE
BACK.

08:05.793 --> 08:09.000
OH!

08:09.034 --> 08:16.103
I GOT HIT!

08:16.137 --> 08:20.551
THEY ARE DROPPING HAIR ON ME,
BIG BROTHER, WHERE WERE YOU AT

08:20.586 --> 08:30.551
WHEN I WAS 26?

08:30.586 --> 08:36.517
HOLY SMOKES.

08:36.551 --> 08:40.034
THIS THING IS TILTING LIKE
CRAZY.

08:40.068 --> 08:41.793
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN HANG ON.

08:41.827 --> 08:45.482
I WANT TO WIN THIS THING FOR MY
SHARKS BUT IF, IS MIESHA GOING

08:45.517 --> 08:52.206
TO BUY ME A NEW SHOULDER?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.551
..

08:54.586 --> 08:58.655
THIS IS JUST NOT FUN.

08:58.689 --> 09:03.275
IT IS A SHOCKER OF "CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER" 3, TODD AND LAMAR

09:03.310 --> 09:04.517
HAVE FALLEN.

09:04.551 --> 09:07.655
MOVE OVER, BOYS, I THINK IT
IS ALL DOWN TO ME TO TAKE THIS

09:07.689 --> 09:11.965
COMPETITION AND BRING HOME THE
HOH.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.241
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHANNA, CARSON

09:15.275 --> 09:19.689
AND TODRICK, THE NUMBERS ARE NOT
IN MY FAVOR RIGHT NOW.

09:19.724 --> 09:23.482
WE HAVE HAD THE MOMENTUM ON OUR
SIDE OF THE HOUSE BASICALLY THE

09:23.517 --> 09:27.413
ENTIRE TIME, AND I KNOW THAT THE
SECOND WE GIVE THAT UP THAT I AM

09:27.448 --> 09:29.344
GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE
TARGET.

09:29.379 --> 09:33.068
SO THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
EVER THAT TODRICK COMES THROUGH

09:33.103 --> 09:34.862
AND KEEPS THAT MOMENTUM ON OUR
SIDE.

09:34.896 --> 09:40.517
COME ON, TODRICK, YOU HAVE GOT
THIS.

09:40.551 --> 09:55.241
WE ARE BASICALLY PAALLEL TO

09:55.275 --> 09:56.448
THE GROUND RIGHT NOW.

09:56.482 --> 10:00.551
I WANT TO FALL SO BAD, BUT I
CANNOT UNTIL TODRICK FALLS

10:00.586 --> 10:01.241
FIRST.

10:01.275 --> 10:03.103
EVERY SECOND OF THIS IS AGONY.

10:03.137 --> 10:18.482
MY PALMS, MY WRISTS, MY ELBOWS
ARE ACHING, I AM FREEZING.

10:23.586 --> 10:29.724
IF I FALL IT IS DOWN TO
CARSON AND TODRICK.

10:29.758 --> 10:33.137
IF CARSON WINS, THIS COULD FLIP
THE HOUSE, BUT IF TODRICK WINS,

10:33.172 --> 10:35.724
I AM IN BIG TROUBLE.

10:35.758 --> 10:39.413
I HAVE GOT TO STAY UP HERE
AND WIN THIS THING, BECAUSE WE

10:39.448 --> 10:41.068
CANNOT LET CARSON LIVE ANOTHER
WEEK.

10:41.103 --> 10:45.103
HE IS TOO BIG OF A THREAT IN
THIS HOUSE.

10:45.137 --> 10:48.413
YOU CAN DO IT!

10:48.448 --> 10:49.103
WHOO!

10:49.137 --> 10:54.482
CARSON!

10:54.517 --> 11:00.413
OH, MY LAND, SHANNA HAS NOW
FALLEN DOWN, NOW IT IS ME VERSUS

11:00.448 --> 11:03.206
TODRICK, IF I DON'T WIN THIS I
WILL BE ON THE BLOCK FOR A THIRD

11:03.241 --> 11:05.137
TIME IN A ROW.

11:05.172 --> 11:10.689
SO WE NEED A VICTORY.

11:10.724 --> 11:11.758
COME ON, CARSON.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.068
FIGHT FOR IT, FIGHT FOR IT.

11:33.103 --> 11:37.172
CARSON AND TODRICK ARE LITERALLY
TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE.

11:37.206 --> 11:38.137
THIS IS IT.

11:38.172 --> 11:40.482
THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE TO FLIP
THIS HOUSE.

11:40.517 --> 11:43.172
IF WE ARE GOING TO BEAT THE
OTHER SIDE, THIS IS THE TIME TO

11:43.206 --> 11:44.448
DO IT.

11:44.482 --> 11:48.137
IT TODRICK WINS THIS, CARSON AND
I ARE RIGHT BACK ON THE BLOCK

11:48.172 --> 11:49.379
AND THAT AIN'T WHAT WE WANT.

11:49.413 --> 11:53.655
COME ON, CARSON.

11:53.689 --> 11:58.000
DON'T GIVE UP!

11:58.034 --> 12:01.241
AT THIS POINT, THE WALL IS NOW
LIKE PARALLEL WITH THE GROUND.

12:01.275 --> 12:04.620
IT IS LIKE HANG-GLIDING,
ESSENTIALLY.

12:04.655 --> 12:10.344
ALL OF MY MUSCLES ARE STARTING
TO QUIVER, AND NOT IN A GOOD

12:10.379 --> 12:10.793
WAY.

12:10.827 --> 12:13.931
FIGHT FOR IT.

12:13.965 --> 12:14.655
OH, MY GOD.

12:14.689 --> 12:19.103
IT IS DOWN TO ME AND CARSON.

12:19.137 --> 12:22.344
FITTING THAT THIS IS THE GAYEST
COMPETITION I HAVE SEEN ON BIG

12:22.379 --> 12:25.241
BROTHER BUT I NEED TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION NOT JUST FOR ME BUT

12:25.275 --> 12:27.758
WITH MIESHA, SHE IS WITHOUT A
DOUBT THE BIGGEST TARGET THIS

12:27.793 --> 12:30.620
THIS HOUSE, THEY ARE DEFINITELY
COMING FOR HER.

12:30.655 --> 12:34.862
AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT
WOULD BE EASY FOR A DANCER OF MY

12:34.896 --> 12:38.827
AGE AND PHYSICAL CONDITION TO
BEAT SOMEBODY WHO IS 52 YEARS

12:38.862 --> 12:43.586
OLD, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW CARSON
KRESSLEY.

12:43.620 --> 12:48.275
PERFECT, NEVER BETTER.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.310
I WANT TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION MORE THAN LIFE

12:52.344 --> 12:53.517
ITSELF.

12:53.551 --> 12:55.620
BUT LET ME TELL YOU MANAGER, IT
IS BECOMING REALLY, REALLY

12:55.655 --> 12:59.344
SLIPPERY AND I AM SO NERVOUS I
THINK IT IS TIME TO GET UP MY

12:59.379 --> 13:03.413
OLD FRIEND AND SAY, HEY, LET'S
MAKE A DEAL.

13:03.448 --> 13:07.034
YOU WANT TO MAKE A DEAL OR
NOT?

13:07.068 --> 13:09.827
IS IT TIME, ARE THEY TRYING
TO MAKE A DEAL UP THERE?

13:09.862 --> 13:11.448
TODRICK, YOU DO IT.

13:11.482 --> 13:12.620
HOLD ON.

13:12.655 --> 13:16.413
I NOTICE THAT CARSON AND
TODRICK SEEM TO BE TALKING.

13:16.448 --> 13:18.517
II CAN'T HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAI.

13:18.551 --> 13:22.448
I AM ASSUMING TODRICK IS TRYING
TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL.

13:22.482 --> 13:26.551
MY EGGS ARE ALL IN ONE BASKET, I
JUST NEED TODRICK TO HOLD ON AS

13:26.586 --> 13:27.137
LONG AS HE POSSIBLY CAN.

13:27.172 --> 13:36.379
I CAN MAKE A DEAL.

13:36.413 --> 13:40.000
YEP.

CONGRATULATIONS, CARSON, YOU
ARE THE NEW HOH.

14:21.448 --> 14:24.034
THANK YOU.

14:24.068 --> 14:25.965
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.241
THERE IS A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN,
KIDS.

14:29.275 --> 14:32.724
THINGS ARE GOING TO START
CHANGING AROUND HERE.

14:32.758 --> 14:33.448
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD.

14:33.482 --> 14:35.137
OH, MY GOD.

14:35.172 --> 14:37.137
A WIN.

14:37.172 --> 14:39.034
HEY, HEY, HEY!

14:39.068 --> 14:40.241
WHO HAS THE POWER?

14:40.275 --> 14:41.482
WE GOT THE POWER.

14:41.517 --> 14:42.275
WHO GOT THE POWER?

14:42.310 --> 14:44.241
WE GOT THE POWER.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.137
EVERYTHING JUST CHANGED.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.793
THE GAME HAS CHANGED.

14:48.827 --> 14:49.482
MIESHA, WHO?

14:49.517 --> 14:52.137
WHAT IS HER NAME AGAIN?

14:52.172 --> 14:54.103
I FORGOT HER NAME ALREADY.

14:54.137 --> 14:59.068
I WAS SO CLOSE, THANKFULLY I
WAS ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH

14:59.103 --> 15:04.344
CARSON BUT THE REST OF MY TEAM
COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

15:04.379 --> 15:09.275
AND BY THAT I MEAN THEY ARE
DEFINITELY IN TROUBLE.

15:09.310 --> 15:12.482
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF GOOD.

15:12.517 --> 15:17.586
CARSON WINS HELLO WORSE CASE
SCENARIO, NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:25.931 --> 15:31.137
HA, OH, AND WHAT JUST
HAPPENED?

15:31.172 --> 15:36.068
DID LITTLE OLD ME JUST WIN HOH?

15:36.103 --> 15:39.206
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP,

15:39.241 --> 15:39.896
AMERICA.

15:39.931 --> 15:41.379
HOW DID YOU STAY UP THERE?

15:41.413 --> 15:43.586
I LIKE DIED.

15:43.620 --> 15:45.000
OH, MY GOD.

15:45.034 --> 15:45.379
YOU HIT THE WALL.

15:45.413 --> 15:46.379
I KNOW.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.379
I AM FREAKING OUT THAT CARSON
JUST WENT HOH.

15:49.413 --> 15:53.551
I JUST LOST MY BIGGEST ALLY,
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK LEAVING SO

15:53.586 --> 15:58.620
THAT CARSON WINNING HOH, AH,
MIESHA SIDE OF THE HOUSE I KNOW

15:58.655 --> 16:02.275
IS JUST DESTROYED.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.551
AND IT IS AMAZING.

16:03.586 --> 16:08.344
THANK YOU SO MUCH, THIS IS
BITTERSWEET THE MUSICAL, I FEEL

16:08.379 --> 16:12.000
SAFE AND I TRUST THAT CARSON
WON'T PUT ME UP ON THE BLOCK OR

16:12.034 --> 16:15.655
BACK DOOR ME BUT THERE IS BAD
NEWS FOR MIESHA, THERE IS NOT A

16:15.689 --> 16:18.931
QUESTION IN MY MIND HE WILL PUT
HER UP THIS WEEK, I NEED MIESHA

16:18.965 --> 16:22.827
TO STAY IN THIS GAME FOR MY
SANITY AND EVEN TO HAVE A CHANCE

16:22.862 --> 16:28.551
OF MAKING IT TO THE END OF THIS
COMPETITION.

16:28.586 --> 16:31.034
I WILL NOT BE SURPRISED IF I

16:31.068 --> 16:35.344
AM ON THE BLOCK THIS WEEK, BUT
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS FROM

16:35.379 --> 16:51.310
THIS POINT, I REFUSE TO GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

17:02.310 --> 17:03.448
HOLLA.

17:03.482 --> 17:07.344
THE TWISTERS ARE STAYING
STEALING IT FOR THEMSELVES.

17:07.379 --> 17:10.344
OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS SUCH A
STRESSFUL DAY.

17:10.379 --> 17:13.413
IT IS A MIRACLE, CHRISTMAS
MIRACLE.

17:13.448 --> 17:16.793
I JUST TRIED TO STAY IN THE
ZONE.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.793
I WANTED TO SCREAM, CARSON,
IN AT THE LOSING HIS FOOTING,

17:19.827 --> 17:22.379
BUT I COULDN' DO THAT, SO I WAS
LIKE --

17:22.413 --> 17:26.551
HE ACTUALLY MADE A DEAL WITH
ME AT THE END, IF I FALL OFF

17:26.586 --> 17:27.827
WILL YOU NOT PUT ME?

17:27.862 --> 17:31.965
UP AND HE SAID ABSOLUTELY, THE
BIGGEST THREAT WILL CERTAINLY BE

17:32.000 --> 17:35.310
NOMINATED BECAUSE HE HAD NO
PROBLEMS NOMINATING ME FOR WEEKS

17:35.344 --> 17:36.482
IN A ROW.

17:36.517 --> 17:39.689
YEAH, JUST TO HAVE HER
PICTURE GO UP ON THAT WALL IS

17:39.724 --> 17:43.034
GOING TO BE -- I KNOW.

17:43.068 --> 17:45.068
THE HIGHLIGHT --
I CAN'T WAIT TO QUOTE HER

17:45.103 --> 17:48.965
EXACT WORDS AND SAY, I HAVE TO
PUT YOU UP BECAUSE YOU ARE THE

17:49.000 --> 17:51.034
BIGGEST THREAT.

17:51.068 --> 17:53.344
AND ESPECIALLY TODD.

17:53.379 --> 17:55.275
TODD SHOULD BE.

17:55.310 --> 17:58.275
BECAUSE TODD NECESSARIED WITH MY
WOMAN.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.241
AND HE IS LOYAL AS HELL TO
HER.

18:00.275 --> 18:03.379
THAT'S WHY I AM THINKING IT
IS GOING TO BE THE TWO OF THEM.

18:03.413 --> 18:04.517
YEAH.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.862
AND THEN AT LEAST GET RID OF ONE
BAD APPLE.

18:06.896 --> 18:10.862
YES, YES.

18:10.896 --> 18:15.965
THIS IS JUST WORST SAYS
SCENARIO AND AT THE WORST TIME

18:16.000 --> 18:18.655
IT COULD EVER BE, THERE IS A
PART OF ME THAT TRIED TO

18:18.689 --> 18:21.586
NEGOTIATE A DEAL FOR YOU BUT I
WAS ABOUT TO FALL OFF AND THERE

18:21.620 --> 18:25.862
IS NO WAY HE HE WOULD NEGOTIATE
A DEAL FOR BOTH OF US AND IF I

18:25.896 --> 18:28.655
DON'T GET THIS DEAL BEFORE I
FALL OFF THEN THERE IS A GREAT

18:28.689 --> 18:30.206
CHANCE BOTH OF US WILL BE UP.

18:30.241 --> 18:31.551
YEAH.

18:31.586 --> 18:35.379
I AM REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT
NOW WITH JUST MY TRACK RECORD IN

18:35.413 --> 18:36.448
THIS GAME.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.275
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE WON
SOMETHING BY NOW.

18:39.310 --> 18:45.310
LIKE THERE IS STILL TIME FOR ME
TO REDEEM MYSELF, BUT LIKE IT

18:45.344 --> 18:47.275
NEEDED TO BE TONIGHT.

18:47.310 --> 18:51.172
YOU JUST HAVE BEEN SO LIKE
AMAZING TO WORK WITH AND LIKE

18:51.206 --> 18:54.275
EVEN IN RELATIONSHIPS AND
FRIENDSHIPS I HAVE NEVER BEEN

18:54.310 --> 19:01.103
THE PERSON THAT LIKE DOESN'T
COME THROUGH ON MY END, YOU

19:01.137 --> 19:01.827
KNOW?

19:01.862 --> 19:02.689
I WOULDN'T CHANGE IT, THOUGH.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.793
WHAT?

19:03.827 --> 19:04.896
ANY OF THAT.

19:04.931 --> 19:06.482
CHOOSING YOU.

19:06.517 --> 19:10.551
OH.

19:10.586 --> 19:17.275
I LOVE YOU.

19:17.310 --> 19:23.310
I KNOW BUT -- I AM JUST SO
FRUSTRATED.

19:23.344 --> 19:25.137
I AM SO SORRY.

19:25.172 --> 19:26.137
DON'T BE SORRY.

19:26.172 --> 19:35.034
I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:35.068 --> 19:40.517
YEAH, THE VETO -- WHO IS
GOING TO BE PUT UP WITH THE VETO

19:40.551 --> 19:45.068
IT IS GOING TO BE -- WHOEVER
IS PICKED --

19:45.103 --> 19:46.896
SIN, I CAN'T THEY WON'T PUT
HER UP.

19:46.931 --> 19:52.862
THEY ARE GOING TO GO --
SO WE ARE THE ONLY TWO LEFT.

19:52.896 --> 19:56.103
THIS GAME UP HERE IS A LITTLE
MORE SIMPLE WITH LESS PEOPLE

19:56.137 --> 19:59.068
HERE, BUT STILL SOME THINGS I
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT IN THIS

19:59.103 --> 20:00.344
GAME.

20:00.379 --> 20:04.517
IF ONE OF THEM WINS THE VETO,
THEY WILL TAKE THEMSELVES OFF

20:04.551 --> 20:06.310
WHICH --
OKAY, WON'T PICK ONE OF THEM.

20:06.344 --> 20:10.724
NO, IT IS ONE OF THEM THAT
GOES UP THERE.

20:10.758 --> 20:13.551
AM I --
TRUST ME, I KNOW THE GAME

20:13.586 --> 20:14.862
VERY WELL.

20:14.896 --> 20:19.137
I THINK LAMAR UNDERSTANDS HOW
HALF THE GAME WORKS, BUT I THINK

20:19.172 --> 20:22.827
EVENTUALLY HE WILL UNDERSTAND
HOW THE WHOLE GAME WORKS BUT BY

20:22.862 --> 20:36.172
THEN HE MAY BE AT HOME.

20:36.206 --> 20:46.068
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY HOH --
WE DO, WE DO, YES!

20:46.103 --> 20:50.413
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD.

20:50.448 --> 20:56.413
I AM NOT A FAKE PERSON AND I
AM NOT GOING TO GO UP THERE AND

20:56.448 --> 21:00.137
PLAY KISS ASS AND CELEBRATE WHEN
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT IS LAST

21:00.172 --> 21:03.103
THING THAT I WANTED TO HAPPEN.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.379
IS IT PAINTED DIFFERENT?

21:05.413 --> 21:08.758
MAYBE I ASKED THEM TO REDECORATE
AND PUT IN A SHOE CLOSET, YOU

21:08.793 --> 21:09.275
KNOW,.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.724
OH, MY GOODNESS.

21:12.758 --> 21:16.586
YOU ARE ALL WELCOME ANY TIME.

21:16.620 --> 21:19.137
HERE SHE IS, EVERYBODY.

21:19.172 --> 21:24.344
YAY!

21:24.379 --> 21:25.034
PLEASE COME ANY TIME.

21:25.068 --> 21:26.103
WHO IS THIS?

21:26.137 --> 21:29.206
OH, THAT'S MY NIECE AND MY
SISTER.

21:29.241 --> 21:30.310
OH, WOW.

21:30.344 --> 21:35.310
AND THAT'S MY HORSE BOBO AND ME
AND MY FRIEND TOM.

21:35.344 --> 21:36.241
OHHH!

21:36.275 --> 21:37.448
I LOVE IT.

21:37.482 --> 21:42.172
SO I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE IN
MY HOH SUITE, IT COULD USE

21:42.206 --> 21:45.103
BETTER CLOSET SPACE, I AM NOT
GOING TO LIE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE

21:45.137 --> 21:46.344
IS GREAT.

21:46.379 --> 21:50.896
I HAVE PICTURES OF MY FAMILY AND
MY HORSES AND I HAVE ALWAYS

21:50.931 --> 21:53.034
THOUGHT I WAS A BIT OF A HO.

21:53.068 --> 21:55.344
ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE!

21:55.379 --> 21:57.586
OH, WHERE IS MIESHA?

21:57.620 --> 22:00.310
I NOTICE SHE DIDN'T COME UP FOR
THE PARTY.

22:00.344 --> 22:05.724
SHE MUST BE BUSY.

22:05.758 --> 22:06.344
EATING KALE.

22:23.034 --> 22:24.896
HI.

22:24.931 --> 22:27.034
I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.

22:27.068 --> 22:29.862
AND BE REALLY, REALLY CLEAR AND
HONEST.

22:29.896 --> 22:34.965
I AM GOING TO PUT MIESHA AND
TODD UP.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.310
I WOULD NEVER, EVER BREAK OUR
DEAL BECAUSE WE AGREED THAT I

22:39.344 --> 22:39.862
WOULDN'T PUT YOU UP.

22:39.896 --> 22:41.068
UH-HUH.

22:41.103 --> 22:50.034
BUT IF YOU PLAN TO VETO --
THE NOMINATION IS THE SAME.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.344
THAT'S SO SCARY, OBVIOUSLY.

22:52.379 --> 22:57.827
I KNOW, BUT I THINK THAT IS
KIND OF HOW IT HAS TO BE.

22:57.862 --> 23:02.275
THE FOUR OF US ALL STARTED
OUT TOGETHER AT ONE POINT IN

23:02.310 --> 23:03.793
TIME, YOU KNOW. THIS WAS OUR
ORIGINAL THING.

23:03.827 --> 23:05.827
YEAH.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.517
WOULDN'T THAT BE SO GREAT TO
ALL BE REUNITED.

23:08.551 --> 23:09.482
YEAH.

23:09.517 --> 23:11.034
I THINK THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
TO DO THAT.

23:11.068 --> 23:15.172
NONE OF US HAVE A CHANCE IF
SHE IS UP THERE.

23:15.206 --> 23:18.827
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT IF ONE
OF US COULD WIN.

23:18.862 --> 23:19.758
YEAH.

23:19.793 --> 23:20.172
SORRY.

23:20.206 --> 23:21.137
IT IS OKAY.

23:21.172 --> 23:25.793
I JUST WASN'T --
WE JUST WANT IT TO BE

23:25.827 --> 23:29.724
ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETE THINK
TRANSPARENT, COMPLETELY TRANCE

23:29.758 --> 23:30.896
PARENT.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.310
I ALWAYS HAD A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH TODRICK IF WE

23:33.344 --> 23:36.103
GET HIM BACK IN THE FOLD AND
THAT GETS RID OF MIESHA ALL IS

23:36.137 --> 23:39.137
RIGHT WITH THE WORLD.

23:39.172 --> 23:42.344
MAYBE WE CAN EVEN GO BACK TO
GUCCI.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.862
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

23:43.896 --> 23:48.172
SO IF SHE WERE TO LEAVE, THEN
THE FOUR OF US LEGITIMATE HE

23:48.206 --> 23:53.310
WORK TOGETHER TO GET LAMAR AND
TODD OUT, AND THEN MAY THE BEST

23:53.344 --> 23:54.827
MAN WIN.

23:54.862 --> 23:57.689
WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO BE
WITH US.

23:57.724 --> 24:00.931
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS
COULD BE WHAT IT IS, THEN THIS

24:00.965 --> 24:02.137
IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE.

24:02.172 --> 24:06.413
WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU WORK
WITH US SO WE CAN GET TO THE

24:06.448 --> 24:07.931
FINAL FOUR.

24:07.965 --> 24:10.586
ALL RIGHT.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.068
I CAME INTO THIS GAME TO PLAY
FOR MYSELF.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.724
I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH OF A
CHANCE STANDING NEXT TO MIESHA

24:15.758 --> 24:18.931
IN THE FINAL VOTE TO WIN THIS
GAME, SO IT IS NOT HORRIBLE FOR

24:18.965 --> 24:22.482
MY GAME FOR MIESHA TO BE TAKEN
OUT, BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS

24:22.517 --> 24:26.172
TOO SOON, I ALSO DON'T WANT TO
BE A PART OF THIS FOUR SOME AND

24:26.206 --> 24:31.965
GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER IF I
AM THE FIRST ONE KICKED OUT.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.206
BEFORE I DO THIS, I WANT TO
TALK TO MIESHA.

24:34.241 --> 24:38.620
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO DO THAT,

24:38.655 --> 24:42.034
BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE HIM
SPARED SO HE WILL KEEP THE

24:42.068 --> 24:43.103
NOMINATIONS SAFE.

24:43.137 --> 24:49.172
GIRL, IT HAS BEEN A MORNING
ALREADY.

24:49.206 --> 24:50.482
REALLY?

24:50.517 --> 24:54.000
CARSON AND ALL OF THEM PULLED
ME INTO THEIR ROOM AND BASICALLY

24:54.034 --> 24:57.827
SAID, WE WANT TO OFFER YOU A
DEAL THAT IF YOU PLAY AND YOU

24:57.862 --> 25:01.206
WIN THAT YOU KEEP THE NOMINATION
THE SAME.

25:01.241 --> 25:06.724
AND IN RETURN WE WILL HAVE
LIKE A FINAL FOUR.

25:06.758 --> 25:09.275
I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO YOU THIS
WHOLE TIME AND I DON'T THINK

25:09.310 --> 25:13.068
THERE IS A WORLD WHERE I CAN
LIKE CONSIDER THAT DEAL.

25:13.103 --> 25:17.137
I THINK IT IS REALLY THE FINAL
THREE, WITH THE PLAN OF THEM

25:17.172 --> 25:19.551
GETTING ME OUT FIRST ONCE WE GET
TO FINAL FOUR.

25:19.586 --> 25:23.379
I ALSO WANT TO GO TALK TO
THEM AND BE LIKE, LISTEN, SHANNA

25:23.413 --> 25:25.965
HAS BEEN PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF
THIS HOUSE.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.172
YEAH.

25:27.206 --> 25:29.413
BUT SHE IS FINAL FOUR WITH
US, THE ONLY REASON SHE LIKE

25:29.448 --> 25:35.413
LEFT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE STARTED
LIKE PLANNING SEEDS OF DOUBT

25:35.448 --> 25:37.758
WITH CHRIS.

25:37.793 --> 25:41.758
SHE BEING IN FINAL 3 AFTER THAT,
I WAS HONEST AND SHE WAS NOT,

25:41.793 --> 25:43.068
SHE WAS IN THE FINAL FOUR WITH
US.

25:43.103 --> 25:43.482
YEAH.

25:43.517 --> 25:47.034
THEN WHAT?

25:47.068 --> 25:50.551
THIS IS MY HAIL MARY, I HAVE
TO TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT OFF OF

25:50.586 --> 25:54.137
MIESHA AND PUT IT ON SHANNA SO
THERE IS SOMEHOW A WAY I CAN

25:54.172 --> 25:55.379
STAY IN THIS GAME.

25:55.413 --> 25:57.896
I THINK LEAVING HER AT THIS
POINT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO MY

25:57.931 --> 26:01.344
GAME AND HERS, IF I CAN GET
PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON SOMEBODY ELSE

26:01.379 --> 26:05.034
IN THIS HOUSE, THEN MAYBE MIESHA
AND TODRICK COULD LIVE TO SEE

26:05.068 --> 26:06.206
ANOTHER DAY.

26:06.241 --> 26:08.068
SORRY, SHANNA.

26:08.103 --> 26:11.517
YOU ARE CUTE, BUT I AM ABOUT TO
BLOW YOUR HAND.

26:11.551 --> 26:16.103
GAME ON.

26:16.137 --> 26:21.862
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I
HAVE AND I KNOW THESE

26:21.896 --> 26:24.758
CONVERSATIONS ARE LIKE STRESSFUL
FOR YOU, BUT I WOULD BE REMISS I

26:24.793 --> 26:26.758
SEE IF I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO
--

26:26.793 --> 26:28.034
SHOOT.

26:28.068 --> 26:30.068
YOU KNOW I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHERE I STAND WITH WHATEVER IT

26:30.103 --> 26:30.413
IS.

26:30.448 --> 26:32.103
GREAT.

26:32.137 --> 26:36.172
CYNTHIA IS A HARD NUT TO
CRACK, SHE GIVES ME MIXED

26:36.206 --> 26:40.482
SIGNALS, YOU CAN MAKE SENSE TO
CYNTHIA BAILEY SHE WILL BELIEVE

26:40.517 --> 26:42.896
YOU AND I REALLY NEED TO PAINT
THIS NARRATIVE AND GIVE HER THE

26:42.931 --> 26:46.448
FACTS AND TRY TO DO IT AS
QUICKLY AS I CAN THAT THE PERSON

26:46.482 --> 26:51.137
HE HAS BEEN SLEEPING NEXT TO
MIGHT BE A SNAKE.

26:51.172 --> 26:55.241
WITH BLONDE --
I AM JUST KEEPING IT REAL.

26:55.275 --> 27:04.517
SHANNA IS -- SHE HAS BEEN
SUPPOSE FINAL FOUR WITH US,

27:04.551 --> 27:05.827
KEEPING HER PROTECTED.

27:05.862 --> 27:08.068
SHE HAS BEEN A NUMBER ONE
ADVOCATE OF GETTING CARSON OUT

27:08.103 --> 27:09.344
OF THIS HOUSEHOLD.

27:09.379 --> 27:13.103
AM I EXAGGERATING THIS A TINY
BIT?

27:13.137 --> 27:14.034
ABSOLUTELY.

27:14.068 --> 27:16.068
BUT THAT IS THE WAY BIG BROTHER
IS PLAYED.

27:16.103 --> 27:18.827
IT IS JUST, IT IS NOT RIGHT.

27:18.862 --> 27:21.551
I AM -- I AM IN SHOCK.

27:21.586 --> 27:25.965
LIKE I SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH THIS WOMAN EVERY NIGHT.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.689
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SHANNA WAS
BASICALLY WORKING WITH THE OTHER

27:30.724 --> 27:32.034
SIDE THE ENTIRE TIME.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.310
AND PRETTY MUCH PLAYING CARSON
IN A WAY.

27:34.344 --> 27:36.931
I HEAR YOU.

27:36.965 --> 27:39.862
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO WHAT
MIESHA HAS TO SAY.

27:39.896 --> 27:44.034
CAN YOU --
I BASICALLY TOLD HER ABOUT

27:44.068 --> 27:44.931
SHANNA.

27:44.965 --> 27:48.000
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER?

27:48.034 --> 27:51.655
WHO IS THE ONE PERSON THAT
SHANNA WANTS OUT OF THE HOUSE?

27:51.689 --> 27:52.965
CARSON.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.758
HER CHARACTER AND THE WAY SHE
HAS PLAYED THIS GAME HAS BEEN SO

27:55.793 --> 27:59.034
SHADY, IT IS LIKE SHE DOES NOT
DESERVE TO BE IN THAT FINAL

27:59.068 --> 28:00.172
SPOT.

28:00.206 --> 28:02.448
CYNTHIA IS STARTING TO
BELIEVE ME AND THANK GOD, I

28:02.482 --> 28:04.758
DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE
SOLD THIS TO CARSON, BUT I KNOW

28:04.793 --> 28:08.103
IF THE TWO OF US GO TO CARSON,
HE WILL BELIEVE IT.

28:08.137 --> 28:11.137
BUT I AM NOT GOING TO
SACRIFICE THE ONE PERSON WHO HAS

28:11.172 --> 28:15.551
BEEN LIKE ROOTING FOR ME THE
WHOLE TIME TO HELP PROTECT HER.

28:15.586 --> 28:20.172
I DON'T LIKE TAKING THINGS BY
SECONDHAND.

28:20.206 --> 28:22.034
I NEED TO -- CARSON.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.000
AS FATE SHOULD HAVE IT.

28:24.034 --> 28:26.241
HI.

28:26.275 --> 28:28.620
MS. CARSON COMES STRUTTING
INTO THE BATHROOM.

28:28.655 --> 28:30.862
I WAS GETTING READY TO TALK
TO YOU.

28:30.896 --> 28:34.448
THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU
NEED TO HEAR STRAIGHT FROM THE

28:34.482 --> 28:36.620
HORSE'S MOUTH THAT I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW SO JUST SAY IT.

28:36.655 --> 28:39.620
BASICALLY, SHANNA HAS BEEN
PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE.

28:39.655 --> 28:43.034
SHE WAS IN THE FINAL FOUR WITH
ME, HER AND CHRIS KIRKPATRICK,

28:43.068 --> 28:46.413
THAT'S WHY SHE VOTED -- SHE WAS
A PERSON WHO TOLD US YOU NEEDED

28:46.448 --> 28:47.655
TO GO HOME.

28:47.689 --> 28:50.034
WE AGREED, OBVIOUSLY THAT YOU
WERE A THREAT AND SOMEBODY WE

28:50.068 --> 28:50.517
NEEDED TO TAKE OUT.

28:50.551 --> 28:51.793
RIGHT.

28:51.827 --> 28:55.241
YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW SHE HAS
BEEN SITTING IN YOUR GUYS ROOM

28:55.275 --> 28:58.758
BY NIGHT AND OUR ROOM BY DAY,
AND I AM SURE SHE HAS SOME SORT

28:58.793 --> 29:02.620
OF DEAL WITH YOU GUYS --
I APPRECIATE THAT.

29:02.655 --> 29:08.034
OH, MY OH, MY GOSH, YOU KNOWE
THAT EMOJI WHERE YOUR HEAD IS

29:08.068 --> 29:10.137
BLOWING UP, THAT IS ME RIGHTS
NOW.

29:10.172 --> 29:10.896
BUT WITH A BETTER HAIRDO.

29:10.931 --> 29:12.206
SO, WITH A.

29:12.241 --> 29:16.275
SO APPARENTLY SHANNA HAS BEEN
A DOUBLE AGENT THIS ENTIRE TIME.

29:16.310 --> 29:19.724
IT IS LIKE A SCOOBY DOO
EPISODE, LIKE ALL OF THE CLUES

29:19.758 --> 29:22.689
ARE STARTING TO APPEAR AND I AM
THINKING, HAVE I BEEN PLAYED?

29:22.724 --> 29:25.931
I RESPECT YOU BOTH
TREMENDOUSLY.

29:25.965 --> 29:26.551
YOU KNOW --

29:26.586 --> 29:27.724
THE SAME.

29:27.758 --> 29:30.034
ON THE BLOCK STRAIGHT UP
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU GUYS TO

29:30.068 --> 29:32.793
HAVE THE BEST ODDS TO PUT ME ON
THE BLOCK.

29:32.827 --> 29:36.310
PUT WHOEVER ELSE YOU WANT TO
GUARANTEE WILL BE MAYBE A GOOD

29:36.344 --> 29:37.551
CHANCE TO WIN THE VETO.

29:37.586 --> 29:42.896
WE ALL GO IN ON THIS TOGETHER
AND WE BACK DOOR SHANNA.

29:42.931 --> 29:47.172
I WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU WIN,
YOU WIN, YOU WIN, I WILL BURN

29:47.206 --> 29:49.103
THE HOUSE DOWN IF SHANNA WINS.

29:49.137 --> 29:54.379
I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED MIESHA'S
INTEGRITY.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.758
I DON'T QUESTION HER HONESTY.

29:56.793 --> 30:00.068
TODRICK AND I HAVE WORKED
TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS AND SO

30:00.103 --> 30:03.896
IF WE ARE JUST COMING FROM ONE
PERSON, I WOULD MAYBE DOUBT IT,

30:03.931 --> 30:08.482
BUT COMING FROM BOTH OF THEM, I
THINK I BELIEVE THEM.

30:08.517 --> 30:11.655
I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM SAYING
THIS, I AM TENDING TO BE

30:11.689 --> 30:12.827
BELIEVING THE ENEMY.

30:12.862 --> 30:15.448
TODRICK KNOWS I WOULD PROTECT
HIM.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.862
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME THIS
BUT NOW I HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT

30:17.896 --> 30:19.413
WITH YOU THE WHOLE TIME.

30:19.448 --> 30:21.034
ABSOLUTELY. AND PROTECT YOU
THE SAME TIME.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.000
SAME.

30:22.034 --> 30:23.724
YOU SAY THE SAME FOR HER.

30:23.758 --> 30:26.931
YOU GUYS --
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

30:26.965 --> 30:29.379
BUT --
I AM SO -- I AM PROCESSING

30:29.413 --> 30:29.965
THIS NOW.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.206
OFFERING YOU UP.

30:31.241 --> 30:34.551
I THINK MY STRATEGIC PLAN HAS
WORKED AND THERE MIGHT BE A

30:34.586 --> 30:39.758
FIGHTING CHANCE THAT MIESHA AND
I, WE COULD STAY IN THIS HOUSE,

30:39.793 --> 30:40.965
OH, MY GOD.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.965
I THINK THAT CYNTHIA AND
CARSON ARE GOOD ENOUGH PEOPLE

30:44.000 --> 30:46.655
THAT THEY WOULD MAYBE RATHER
PLAY WITH THE DEVIL THEY KNOW

30:46.689 --> 30:47.896
THAN THE DEVIL THAN THEY DON'T.

30:47.931 --> 30:50.413
I REALLY WANT TO GO TALK TO
HER.

30:50.448 --> 30:51.482
LAKE SERIOUSLY.

30:51.517 --> 30:57.655
WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW --
SO WE CAN DO THAT.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.620
ABSOLUTELY.

30:58.655 --> 30:59.344
IF YOU WANT.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.000
OKAY.

31:00.034 --> 31:01.586
BUT --

31:23.103 --> 31:27.034
WHAT'S UP, MOTHER EARTH.

31:27.068 --> 31:29.413
THE TRUTH IS, THE TRUTH HAS
BEEN REVEALED.

31:29.448 --> 31:33.068
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, TODRICK
JUST EXPOSED SHANNA'S WHOLE GAME

31:33.103 --> 31:34.310
TO US.

31:34.344 --> 31:36.793
I LEARNED THAT SHE HAS BEEN
PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE

31:36.827 --> 31:39.068
AND WAS EVEN TARGETING CARSON.

31:39.103 --> 31:41.931
I AM IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW AND I
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I EVER

31:41.965 --> 31:43.206
TRUSTED HIM.

31:43.241 --> 31:46.551
OH, GIRL I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET CARSON THE WHOLE TIME AND

31:46.586 --> 31:48.862
BEEN PLOTTING.

31:48.896 --> 31:51.448
SHE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH
THEM.

31:51.482 --> 31:52.206
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

31:52.241 --> 31:54.482
NOT WITHOUT CARSON.

31:54.517 --> 31:55.137
OKAY.

31:55.172 --> 31:57.310

HOUSE.

32:12.551 --> 32:17.586
THERE IS STILL A CHANCE FOR
US YET.

32:17.620 --> 32:36.310

32:36.344 --> 32:37.586

32:44.965 --> 32:47.620

PLAYING BOTH SIDES THE WHOLE
TIME.

32:53.758 --> 32:56.344
I TOLD YOU GUYS EVERYTHING.

32:56.379 --> 33:01.241
IN THE BEGINNING, SURE, AND
THEN YOU AND TEDDI WERE VERY

33:01.275 --> 33:03.241

I MEAN I WAS ALWAYS WITH YOU

33:11.448 --> 33:12.689

I NEVER SAID THAT TO THEM.

33:42.275 --> 33:43.655
I NEVER IS SAID THAT.

33:43.689 --> 33:44.758
THEY BOTH SAID THAT.

33:44.793 --> 33:46.000
WELL, THAT IS LIE.

33:46.034 --> 33:50.724

33:52.586 --> 33:54.965
AND HE NEEDS TO GO UP, THAT'S
WHAT THEY BOTH SAID.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.793
THAT'S A LIE.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.620
OH, MY GOSH.

33:57.655 --> 34:00.379
MIESHA -- ARE THE ONES THAT
WANT CARSON OUT.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.965
THEY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT IT
WAS A THREAT AND I AGREED BUT I

34:04.000 --> 34:05.206
WAS NEVER TARGETING CARSON.

34:05.241 --> 34:08.827
THAT IS WHY I DID NOT -- I
ALWAYS SAID YOU ARE A THREAT,

34:08.862 --> 34:11.275
CARSON IS A THREAT, WELL, YEAH,
I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD FEEL

34:11.310 --> 34:16.724
THAT WAY, LIKE I DON'T HAVE ANY

34:16.758 --> 34:19.482
THAT'S, THAT YOU WOULD THINK

34:19.517 --> 34:21.931
THAT, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DO
-- THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THIS --

34:21.965 --> 34:23.965
WHAT ARE THEY NOT
UNDERSTANDING?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.551
YES, I WAS WORKING BOTH SIDES
OF THE HOUSE EARLY IN THE GAME,

34:26.586 --> 34:32.034
BUT WHEN CHRIS WAS HOH, MIESHA
PUSHED US, WE MADE OUR DECISION,

34:32.068 --> 34:37.586
AND DREW A LINE IN THE SAND,
CHRIS TOOK OUT MIRAI AND I USED

34:37.620 --> 34:39.000
THE VETO TO SAVE CARSON.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.965
I SAID CARSON I WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.758
WERE YOU IN THE FINAL FOUR
WITH THEM?

34:42.793 --> 34:44.517
WERE YOU TRYING TO BE IN THE
FINAL FOUR?

34:44.551 --> 34:47.413
I WAS TRYING TO -- AND I WILL
TELL YOU HOW THIS ALL HAPPENED.

34:47.448 --> 34:48.482
YOU HAD CASH.

34:48.517 --> 34:49.965
WHEN DID I HAVE SAFETY?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.620
WHEN YOU HAD THE MON WON
HAND.

34:52.655 --> 34:53.724
RIGHT.

34:53.758 --> 34:58.517
I EVEN TOLD CARSON I WAS UP
HERE AND I TOLD YOU --

34:58.551 --> 35:01.034

35:01.068 --> 35:04.034
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO --
WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT,

35:04.068 --> 35:05.137
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU SHANNA.

35:05.172 --> 35:07.551
SHE COMES DOWN, WE COULD ALL
BE ON THE BLOCK.

35:07.586 --> 35:09.413
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU
PROTECTING YOURSELF.

35:09.448 --> 35:10.551
WHAT DID I DO?

35:10.586 --> 35:13.034
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND YOU

35:13.068 --> 35:13.655
HAVE BEEN PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

35:13.689 --> 35:16.034
WHAT DID I DO?

35:16.068 --> 35:19.620
AND SHE EVEN SAID TO TO TO ME
THIS THE HALLWAY, YOU DREW YOUR

35:19.655 --> 35:22.586
LINE, SO THERE IS NO
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD.

35:22.620 --> 35:30.931
CAN YOU --
SHE IS RIGHT AT THE DOOR.

35:30.965 --> 35:34.482
I WILL LET YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR
PRIVACY IN THE BATHROOM, CAN I

35:34.517 --> 35:39.275

WOULD BE AWESOME AND RESPECTFUL.

35:39.310 --> 35:42.551
YOU WOULDN'T LET US HAVE OUR
PRIVACY, BUT, OKAY.

35:42.586 --> 35:44.758
LIKE WHERE WERE WE?

35:44.793 --> 35:46.551
I HAD TO FLOAT.

35:46.586 --> 35:49.275
BUT THEN YOU WERE TELLING THEM,
OH, CARSON AND CYNTHIA HAVE EACH

35:49.310 --> 35:52.862
OTHER, SO I DON'T FEEL SAFE THEY
ARE NOT TALKING TO ME OR LOOKING

35:52.896 --> 35:53.482
AT ME.

35:53.517 --> 35:54.827
I FELT --
I SAID --

35:54.862 --> 35:56.448
YOU WERE PLAYING WITH THE
OTHER GUYS.

35:56.482 --> 36:00.241

MASTERMIND OF THOUSAND AND

BETTER THAN CARSON AND I DO.

36:04.137 --> 36:04.827
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

36:04.862 --> 36:06.172
I HAVE BEEN GUIDING YOU GUYS.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.448
YEAH, AND WE HAVE BEEN
KEEPING YOU SAVE, IN RETURN.

36:08.482 --> 36:10.758
PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS
LOGICALLY, THEY HAVE BEEN

36:10.793 --> 36:12.000
KEEPING ME SAFE?

36:12.034 --> 36:16.965
I WON TWO VETOES, I TOOK
CARSON OFF THE BLOCK.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.862
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK SACRIFICED HIS
GAME SO WE COULD MOVE FORWARD

36:20.896 --> 36:21.551
TOGETHER.

36:21.586 --> 36:22.862
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:22.896 --> 36:26.310
THIS IS THE -- THEY WANT TO
DO.

36:26.344 --> 36:28.724
THEY ARE NOT -- THEY ARE NOT
GOOD PEOPLE.

36:28.758 --> 36:32.793
EVERY MOVE THAT HAS BEEN MADE
WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN CONCERNED

36:32.827 --> 36:34.827
HAS KEPT YOU SAVE, YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ON THE BLOCK.

36:34.862 --> 36:38.517
YOU ARE JUST SAYING -- I WILL
BE BACK DOWNWARD AND EVERYBODY

36:38.551 --> 36:42.517
HAS BEEN ON THE BLOCK BUT YOU AT
THE END OF THE DAY SO IT ACCEPTS

36:42.551 --> 36:44.034
SEEMS YOU HAVE HAD PROTECTION
OVER THERE.

36:44.068 --> 36:46.172
I ASKED -- GOING UP THERE
NOW.

36:46.206 --> 36:50.310
REALLY IN YOUR HEART YOU
THINK THAT IS REAL AND TRUE?

36:50.344 --> 36:52.344
PUT ME ON THE BLOCK.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.275
I DON'T CARE,.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.827
TELL THEM TO THEIR FACE.

36:55.862 --> 36:58.275
I DID NOT TELL THEM.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.551
WE CAN GO DOWN THERE.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.724
I AM NOT DOING THIS.

37:01.758 --> 37:03.137
I AM NOT --
NO.

37:03.172 --> 37:05.586
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
PUT ME --

37:05.620 --> 37:11.172
ON MY CHILDREN --

37:11.206 --> 37:14.241
YOU WORKED THIS HOUSE LIKE
NOBODY.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.000
OKAY.

37:17.034 --> 37:20.448
WELL PLAYED.

37:20.482 --> 37:25.034
I AM NOT FALLING FOR THAT.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.310
I AM NOT.

37:26.344 --> 37:30.379
IF SHE DIDN'T TELL THEM TO
PUT YOU ON THE BLOCK AND -- YOU

37:30.413 --> 37:32.965
NEED TO SAY IT IN THE FACE
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I

37:33.000 --> 37:34.275
WILL BELIEVE.

37:34.310 --> 37:37.034
IF SHE WASN'T TRYING TO BE IN
THE FINAL FOUR SHE SAY IT IN THE

37:37.068 --> 37:38.275
FACE.

37:38.310 --> 37:40.103
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU
BELIEVE THAT, CARSON AND YOU

37:40.137 --> 37:41.379
BELIEVE THAT.

37:41.413 --> 37:43.241
NO, NO, SAY WHAT YOU SAID IN
FRONT OF THE PEOPLE THAT SAID

37:43.275 --> 37:44.482
YOU SAID IT.

37:44.517 --> 37:46.620
AT THE END OF THE DAY, DID
YOU HAVE A FINAL FOUR WITH ME

37:46.655 --> 37:48.379
AND MIESHA AND CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK?

37:48.413 --> 37:51.137
WE NEVER HAD A SOLID FINAL
FOUR.

37:51.172 --> 37:53.586
THERE DON'T NEED TO BE A
NAME.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.034
I WANTED TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS,
ABSOLUTELY.

37:55.068 --> 37:57.965
BUT YOU WERE WORKING WITH US.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.241

PUT ME ON THE BLOCK, I AM COOL

38:03.482 --> 38:04.586

NOT THE TRUTH OR NOT.

40:28.172 --> 40:34.827
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

40:34.862 --> 40:40.413
I AM NOT A BIG BACK DOOR FAN,
BUT SHANNA SEEMS TO BE THE

40:40.448 --> 40:44.379
TARGET THAT EVERYBODY WANTS OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

40:44.413 --> 40:50.448
BUT IF IT GOES ANOTHER WAY I
STILL HAVE MY ORIGINAL TARGET ON

40:50.482 --> 40:51.655
THE BLOCK.

40:51.689 --> 40:53.758
NOT A BAD DAY AT THE OFFICE.

40:53.793 --> 40:55.344
THIS IS CRAZY.

40:55.379 --> 41:00.793
LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO I FELT
LIKE A DEAD WOMAN WALKING, BUT

41:00.827 --> 41:04.620
TODRICK HAD FLIPPED THE SCRIPT
AND NOW I AM FEELING PRETTY

41:04.655 --> 41:05.896
GOOD.

41:05.931 --> 41:10.448
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, BUT,
TOOT, TOOT, ME AND MIESHA WERE

41:10.482 --> 41:14.137
IN TROUBLE AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
SHANNA WILL BE OUT OF THIS

41:14.172 --> 41:16.758
HOUSE, PAT ON THE BACK, TODRICK,
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE IN

41:16.793 --> 41:18.517
THIS HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO THIS.

41:18.551 --> 41:20.551
THIS IS THE RESUME BUILDER I
NEED.

41:20.586 --> 41:24.241
I AM SO HURT AND SO UPSET BY
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

41:24.275 --> 41:27.758
IF I GET TO PLAY IN THIS VETO
COMPETITION I KNOW THAT I WILL

41:27.793 --> 41:29.551
BE PLAYING FOR MYSELF.

41:29.586 --> 41:33.793
AND THAT GOES FOR THE REST OF
THIS GAME GOING FORWARD.

41:33.827 --> 41:38.931
WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE

41:38.965 --> 41:42.275
EITHER MIESHA OR TODD FROM
EVICTION?

41:42.310 --> 41:44.793
PLUS WHO WILL BE THE NEXT
CELEBRITY SEPTEMBER PACKING?

41:44.827 --> 41:51.793
