23:43.691 --> 23:45.325
I protected you!

23:45.359 --> 23:47.527
Beating him is not protection, Tony.

23:47.561 --> 23:48.795
That's getting payback.

23:48.829 --> 23:52.265
Who protected you when you were
smoking in the backyard, huh?

23:52.299 --> 23:55.501
Who hid your beers and lied for you, huh?

23:55.536 --> 23:58.438
So only protect you from
<i>papi but nobody else?</i>

23:58.472 --> 23:59.706
I beat his ass for you.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.874
Don't you blame me.

24:01.909 --> 24:04.077
And I'll do it again.

24:17.358 --> 24:18.891
[Door opens]

24:18.926 --> 24:21.160
Did he say anything? [Door closes]

24:21.195 --> 24:22.528
He... didn't.

24:22.563 --> 24:26.065
He didn't say anything to you?

24:26.100 --> 24:27.700
Let's just go.

24:33.507 --> 24:34.874
Pastor Bennett: Tom is well?

24:37.211 --> 24:40.646
He's good.

24:40.681 --> 24:42.715
It's hard for him, though,

24:42.750 --> 24:46.419
trying to keep a business
running through all of this.

24:46.453 --> 24:49.222
You know, the bills... They just...

24:49.256 --> 24:51.657
keep pilling up.

24:51.692 --> 24:54.560
Gwen's not even out of the hospital yet.

24:54.595 --> 24:56.696
How is she progressing?

24:56.730 --> 24:59.899
She still has trouble walking.

24:59.933 --> 25:03.736
She's been diagnosed with aphasia.

25:03.771 --> 25:06.105
It's a brain dysfunction.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.907
[Monitor beeping steadily,
woman speaking over P.A.]

25:07.941 --> 25:09.876
Pencil?

25:09.910 --> 25:12.912
Eve: She sees objects.
She knows what they are,

25:12.946 --> 25:15.214
but she can't articulate them.

25:18.652 --> 25:19.752
Horse.

25:19.787 --> 25:22.188
And she has holes in her memory.

25:22.222 --> 25:27.393
She can't remember her husband, drugs,

25:27.428 --> 25:30.730
the other men she was sleeping with.

25:30.764 --> 25:32.932
Your daughter getting better

25:32.966 --> 25:36.869
is what's important, not those other things.

25:36.904 --> 25:39.939
But at some point, they will be.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.474
[Sighs]

25:41.508 --> 25:45.745
How do we move on from something

25:45.779 --> 25:49.749
my daughter can't even remember?

25:49.783 --> 25:51.417
[Sighs]

25:51.452 --> 25:52.652
And...

25:52.686 --> 25:57.557
And if we don't tell Gwen the truth,

25:57.591 --> 26:03.229
are we just living lies all over again?

26:03.263 --> 26:05.631
[Sighs]

26:05.666 --> 26:09.335
You have your daughter back.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.370
Start with that.

26:14.842 --> 26:18.745
I was able to find this picture
on Matt Skokie's Facebook page.

26:18.779 --> 26:21.547
Was this taken when he was in the military?

26:21.582 --> 26:24.384
After. He's dressed for an airsoft game.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.953
I can only assume that's a friend of his

26:26.987 --> 26:29.255
wearing a mask of the president.

26:29.290 --> 26:32.258
You can see the caption.
"Went hunting today."

26:32.293 --> 26:35.094
Matt Skokie had a
complicated Internet history.

26:35.129 --> 26:37.497
From the I.S.P. information I could find,

26:37.531 --> 26:40.233
he visited or posted on various sites

26:40.267 --> 26:42.735
that supported so-called patriot movements

26:42.770 --> 26:44.504
and anti-government groups.

26:44.538 --> 26:46.806
The police found drugs on the property,

26:46.840 --> 26:49.809
but the one detective
they had investigating it

26:49.843 --> 26:52.145
was reassigned... Chris Thompson.

26:52.179 --> 26:53.541
A sister.

26:53.541 --> 26:55.448
I've petitioned the police department

26:55.482 --> 26:56.382
for their deposition

26:56.417 --> 26:59.352
of one of Gwen Skokie's alleged lovers,

26:59.386 --> 27:01.654
which, by the way, my sources say

27:01.689 --> 27:03.356
she had more than a few.

27:03.390 --> 27:06.492
Because it's not directly part of the case,

27:06.527 --> 27:09.429
it's not in discovery. But to this point,

27:09.463 --> 27:12.198
the police have not fully
investigated a theory...

27:12.232 --> 27:16.602
A jealous lover or <i>lovers
could have killed Matt Skokie.</i>

27:16.637 --> 27:19.272
Hi. I'm Colleen Sherrod, deputy mayor.

27:19.306 --> 27:20.373
Aliyah Shadeed.

27:20.407 --> 27:22.108
Attorney Timothy Little.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.376
Nice to meet you.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.611
Come. We'll go talk in my office, okay?

27:25.646 --> 27:28.648
[Phone rings in distance] [Sighs]

27:28.682 --> 27:30.921
It's very provocative reading.

27:31.244 --> 27:32.878
The police mishandled things at every turn,

27:32.912 --> 27:35.680
and the prosecutors are just
adding to their mistakes.

27:35.715 --> 27:36.848
There's no evidence showing

27:36.883 --> 27:39.317
my brother ever touched that woman.

27:39.352 --> 27:41.720
Well, it's not unusual
for charges to be made

27:41.754 --> 27:46.625
in the fog of arrest, and...
Your brother fled jurisdiction.

27:46.659 --> 27:48.360
If you falsely accuse someone

27:48.394 --> 27:51.863
and then put the death penalty
on them, they better run.

27:51.898 --> 27:54.833
And that they're calling
what supposedly happened

27:54.867 --> 27:57.302
a hate crime? That's a slap in the face.

27:57.336 --> 27:58.803
Meanwhile, the victim...

27:58.838 --> 28:00.839
People are calling him a 9/11 hero,

28:00.873 --> 28:03.475
not the anti-government drug dealer he was.

28:03.509 --> 28:05.844
The victim's lifestyle isn't on trial.

28:05.878 --> 28:10.048
What if the way he lived
is why he was murdered?

28:10.082 --> 28:11.816
I'm concerned for Carter.

28:11.851 --> 28:14.319
I'm concerned for his emotional health.

28:14.353 --> 28:16.888
All I'm asking is that the mayor's office

28:16.923 --> 28:20.091
gets the city attorney to
open up an investigation

28:20.126 --> 28:22.861
into how this entire case has been handled.

28:22.895 --> 28:25.830
The charges your brother's facing

28:25.865 --> 28:27.866
are exceptionally serious...

28:27.900 --> 28:30.769
Murder, a hate crime.

28:30.803 --> 28:33.205
They deserve to be heard in court.

28:33.239 --> 28:35.106
And I believe a preliminary examination

28:35.141 --> 28:36.841
has been scheduled, and
your brother's lawyers

28:36.876 --> 28:39.844
will be able to make all the
arguments you brought up.

28:39.879 --> 28:41.413
After that, there'll be a trial.

28:41.447 --> 28:43.248
They'll be opportunities for appeals.

28:43.282 --> 28:48.787
So, sooner or later, the
courts <i>might</i> get it right?

28:48.821 --> 28:51.890
The mayor, all of us in his office,

28:51.924 --> 28:55.927
are informed but objective.

28:55.962 --> 28:58.863
It's the obligation of
your brother's defense

28:58.898 --> 29:01.566
to argue against the new evidence.

29:01.601 --> 29:04.269
What new evidence?

29:04.303 --> 29:05.136
Any relevant information

29:05.171 --> 29:06.972
will be made available to both parties.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.908
This is a county matter, not a city matter.

29:09.942 --> 29:12.777
Other than being sympathetic,
I... I'm not sure

29:12.812 --> 29:15.213
what the mayor's office could do for you.

29:15.248 --> 29:16.881
The right thing.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.356
[Phone ringing in distance]

29:31.931 --> 29:33.431
It's not good.

29:33.466 --> 29:34.833
It's only gonna get worse.

29:34.867 --> 29:37.802
The police found the gun
used to kill Matt Skokie.

29:37.837 --> 29:39.337
When?

29:39.372 --> 29:41.573
They found it, they confirmed it,

29:41.607 --> 29:44.476
and they have testimony that puts the gun

29:44.510 --> 29:45.844
in Carter's hand.

29:45.878 --> 29:47.679
Opportunity is slipping away.

29:47.713 --> 29:50.682
Say whatever you have
to to separate yourself,

29:50.716 --> 29:53.118
to save yourself.

29:57.023 --> 30:00.025
You're my lawyer, right?
You have to do what I say.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.860
I'm an officer of the court.

30:01.894 --> 30:04.896
I have to do what's in the
best interest of my client.

30:08.701 --> 30:11.569
I need you to get this to somebody.

30:15.741 --> 30:18.310
Then I need you to get my family together.

a little overwhelming

30:42.912 --> 30:44.713

And she feels more comfortable
being around Esperanza,

30:48.318 --> 30:50.686
having another woman she can relate to.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.555
She's not a woman. She's a little girl.

30:53.590 --> 30:57.626
She's not such a little
girl anymore, <i>carnal.</i>

30:57.661 --> 31:00.729
And for some reason, she
feels she can't talk to you,

31:00.764 --> 31:02.698
can't talk to Tony.

31:04.968 --> 31:06.702

31:06.736 --> 31:09.071

It all started with
trouble at home, <i>ÿqué no?</i>

31:12.575 --> 31:14.109

she's just gonna run away?

31:14.144 --> 31:16.745
No. She's <i>not</i> running away.

better while I'm here.

Tony needs to figure things out for himself,

31:56.486 --> 31:58.754
and you need to think about Tony.

31:58.788 --> 32:01.657

about both my children.

<i>ÿQuién?</i>

35:32.901 --> 35:34.035
Sibila.

35:34.069 --> 35:36.704
Hector? Hector.

35:36.738 --> 35:39.307
Sibila <i>no está aquí. ÿdónde estás?</i>

35:46.748 --> 35:48.883
You <i>can</i> have a lawyer present.

35:52.054 --> 35:53.254
[Beep]

35:53.288 --> 35:54.622
[Recorder clatters]

35:54.656 --> 35:55.790
I'll tell you what I know,

35:55.824 --> 35:59.360
and I'll tell you what I'd
be willing to say in court.

36:01.129 --> 36:03.231
And this is the truth.

36:03.265 --> 36:05.867
I don't know exactly when
bad things started to happen,

36:05.901 --> 36:08.035
but it was pretty soon after we met.

36:08.070 --> 36:12.306
Bad things? Be more specific.

36:12.341 --> 36:16.544
Sexual, psychological, mental, physical.

36:16.578 --> 36:18.145
Bad things.

36:18.180 --> 36:21.249
I kept telling myself
it's not really abusive.

36:21.283 --> 36:22.450
He loves me.

36:22.484 --> 36:29.223
But, you know, same time, I
was trapped, and he knew that.

36:29.258 --> 36:31.993
He used it to control me.

36:32.027 --> 36:33.828
You know, it all started with fear.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.463
He liked to get me drunk,

36:35.497 --> 36:37.899
said I seemed happier like that.

36:37.933 --> 36:40.401
He liked to make me happy, he said.

36:40.435 --> 36:43.170
He kept me wasted so I couldn't do anything

36:43.205 --> 36:44.839
when his friends came over.

36:44.873 --> 36:50.645
I would get passed around,
and I couldn't defend myself.

36:50.679 --> 36:52.446
I begged for them to stop.

36:56.885 --> 36:58.586
But they covered my mouth

36:58.620 --> 37:00.788
and laughed while they pounded away.

37:03.725 --> 37:05.593
This happened all the time.

37:05.627 --> 37:06.560
Carter got you drunk,

37:06.595 --> 37:09.931
and he and his friends sexually abused you?

37:09.965 --> 37:12.433
Carter didn't abuse me.

37:12.467 --> 37:13.501
He loves me.

37:13.535 --> 37:18.539
He'd never treat me the
way my own brother did.

37:18.573 --> 37:20.708
That's how it happened, right, Brian?

37:20.742 --> 37:22.109
Brian?

37:22.144 --> 37:23.311
You would take me in the garage

37:23.345 --> 37:25.980
and we would camp out behind
dad's car and get hammered.

37:26.014 --> 37:27.868
- No, we... no, we didn't...
- You called your friends over,

37:27.872 --> 37:31.819
and they would play the Aubrey game...
let's do something to Aubrey's ass.

37:31.853 --> 37:34.555
What fits here? What fits there?

37:34.589 --> 37:36.324
I can still smell the grass
coming from that lawn mower

37:36.358 --> 37:39.460
they used to bend me
over. It would take days

37:39.494 --> 37:42.630
to get the grease off my
hands from that filthy floor.

37:42.664 --> 37:45.733
You crazy bitch. That's, uh,
that's not true. She's lying.

37:45.767 --> 37:47.401
You know she's lying!

37:47.436 --> 37:49.403
- Brian. Brian!
- She's a drug addict!

37:49.438 --> 37:50.938
- She's sick, all right?
- Brian! Brian!

37:50.973 --> 37:53.574
Why... why would you even say something
like that? <i>Why?! [Door opens]</i>

37:53.608 --> 37:55.676
- Brian!
- Let's go.

37:55.711 --> 37:56.911
It's not true!

37:56.945 --> 37:58.412
- Get out.
- I swear!

37:58.447 --> 38:00.414
- Ask my friends!
- Brian.

38:00.449 --> 38:02.316
- Call them!
- Brian!

38:02.351 --> 38:03.384
[Door closes]

38:05.420 --> 38:09.056
I am sick. I messed up.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.829
I'm not mentally fit to
testify against anybody.

38:14.863 --> 38:17.531
[Recorder clatters]

38:21.069 --> 38:23.037
[Door closes]

38:23.071 --> 38:26.374
Why would you lie about your brother?

38:26.408 --> 38:29.343
I did it for Carter,

38:29.378 --> 38:31.045
'cause he saved me.

38:31.079 --> 38:33.748
[Door clanks]

38:43.759 --> 38:44.925
[Chuckles softly]

38:51.233 --> 38:53.768
[Door buzzes]

38:57.406 --> 38:58.205
[Door closes]

38:58.240 --> 39:01.776
You look better. How are you feeling?

39:01.810 --> 39:03.611
I heard from Aubrey.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.514
Hmm. [Sighs]

39:07.849 --> 39:09.583
Let me tell you,

39:09.618 --> 39:12.820
I'm going through hell right now.

39:12.854 --> 39:15.423
Everybody in the world is
trying to pull us apart.

39:17.259 --> 39:19.794
You don't know what it means to have some...

39:19.828 --> 39:22.897
Just some little thing to hold on to.

39:22.931 --> 39:25.733
I'm trying to give you something more.

39:25.767 --> 39:26.967
What?

39:27.002 --> 39:30.004
What <i>are</i> you trying to do?

39:30.038 --> 39:32.573
You have to have faith.

39:34.709 --> 39:37.645
<i>You</i> have to have faith.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.747
<i>You</i> got to have it.

39:44.886 --> 39:45.953
For me...

39:45.987 --> 39:49.757
Man, faith is just the crap
that fills up the space

39:49.791 --> 39:52.693
where reality's supposed to live.

39:52.727 --> 39:54.829
You gotta get real, aliyah.

40:00.735 --> 40:02.636
I've tried.

40:05.140 --> 40:06.107
I know.

40:06.141 --> 40:08.676
I've tried to do what I can.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.644
I know.

40:10.679 --> 40:13.080
It's bigger than you.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.417
Bigger than us.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.287
Nothing you <i>can</i> do.

40:26.328 --> 40:30.698
Now I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

40:30.732 --> 40:35.035
We have 15 minutes.

40:35.070 --> 40:37.037
What do you wanna talk about?

40:40.509 --> 40:43.844
I don't know.

40:43.879 --> 40:46.514
Nothing in particular.

41:01.029 --> 41:02.930
[Voice breaking] But I know
if I go back to my cell,

41:02.964 --> 41:04.865
I'm gonna be alone.

41:08.603 --> 41:11.572
I can't take being alone anymore.

41:16.111 --> 41:19.647
Aliyah: Family is something we
constantly take for granted.

41:22.717 --> 41:24.418
I've been around and
around Carter's problems

41:24.452 --> 41:28.689
so much, so long, what I was missing is...

41:28.723 --> 41:31.192
[Sighs]

41:31.226 --> 41:33.727
I started calling him "my cause,"

41:33.762 --> 41:35.462
and he's not just a cause.

41:35.497 --> 41:37.898
He's not just someone to
convert or save or elevate.

41:37.933 --> 41:41.602
He's my brother. That's my brother.

41:41.636 --> 41:44.572
And for my brother, I ask
for the simplest thing...

41:44.606 --> 41:46.307
For people to honor our right to assemble

41:46.341 --> 41:49.210
and call attention to his situation.

41:49.244 --> 41:52.079
I believe it's a right that's
being willfully denied.

41:52.113 --> 41:54.648
So we're going to set up here.

41:54.683 --> 41:56.617
We're going to gather who we can,

41:56.651 --> 41:58.719
and we're going to assemble anyway.

41:58.753 --> 42:00.955
And I know what some people will say.

42:00.989 --> 42:03.958
"They're looking for a fight.
They're looking for trouble."

42:03.992 --> 42:05.125
That's not true.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.262
All I'm trying to do is
speak on my brother's behalf.

42:08.296 --> 42:10.731
If they let us do that peacefully,

42:10.765 --> 42:12.900
then it's all good.

42:12.934 --> 42:15.002
If we're greeted any other way,

42:15.036 --> 42:17.271
then what happens isn't on us.

42:17.305 --> 42:19.139
It's on them.
