[man calling race indistinctly]

10:38.855 --> 10:41.597
[indistinct conversations]

10:52.173 --> 10:55.524
THIS IS SO RIDICULOUS.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.138

HOW MUCH DID YOU BET?50.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.761

11:58.761 --> 12:02.765
JANE, LET'S GO. NOW.I WON THE TRIFECTA.
I GOT A LITTLE CASH TO COLLECT.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.072
COOL. GO AHEAD THEN.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.508
OKAY.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.423

12:08.423 --> 12:09.685
COUGH UP.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.516
THANK YOU.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.344

12:19.216 --> 12:22.263
DO I WANNA KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?UH, NO.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.005
SINCE WHEN DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HORSES?I'M NOT ONE TO BRAG.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.050
HOW'D YOU DO IT?
ANALYZE THE FORM?

12:27.050 --> 12:28.965
AH, I JUST PICKED
THE COOLEST NAMES.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.967
COME ON.
TELL ME HOW YOU WON.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.621
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.492
I HATE IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.413
HOW'D THEY DO IT?

12:42.413 --> 12:43.763
KILL HIM?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.852
BASEBALL BAT TO THE HEAD,
MOST LIKELY.

12:45.852 --> 12:49.203
OH, GOD.

12:49.203 --> 12:52.206
ANY NAMES SPRING TO MIND?
ENEMIES HE MAY HAVE HAD?

12:52.206 --> 12:55.209
WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK INTO
BILL'S FINANCES, BUT WE CAN'T

12:55.209 --> 12:57.820
FIND ANY CREDIT CARDS,
NOT EVEN A BANK ACCOUNT.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.519
NO, BILL WAS FUNNY THAT WAY.
HE JUST... DIDN'T TRUST BANKS.

13:01.519 --> 13:04.131
CASH ONLY.
HAD A SAFE IN HIS CLOSET.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.655
HOW LONG HAD YOU KNOWN HIM?

13:06.655 --> 13:09.310
NOVEMBER 6th WOULD HAVE BEEN
4 YEARS.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.443
WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER
HE HAD LEFT HORSE RACING?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.445
BILL DIDN'T LEAVE HORSE RACING.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.753
THEY SUSPENDED HIM
TWO YEARS AGO.

13:17.753 --> 13:22.976
THERE WAS A-A PILE-UP
GOING INTO A TURN.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.936
THEY SAID IT WAS BILL'S FAULT,
WHICH IT WASN'T.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.982
THEY BANNED HIM FOR A YEAR.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.332
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD ON HIM.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.293
IT WAS A REAL DARK TIME.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.818
YOU KNOW, ALL BILL
EVER WANTED TO DO WAS RIDE.

13:40.515 --> 13:43.257
HE STRUGGLED WITH HIS TEMPER.
THAT'S A FACT.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.651
IS THAT WHY YOU BROKE UP
WITH HIM?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.529
THE, UH...

13:54.529 --> 13:58.272
THE DAY HE GOT THAT JOB
WITH HOLWELL?

13:58.272 --> 14:02.450
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD GO OUT
AND CELEBRATE, YOU KNOW? SUSHI.

14:02.450 --> 14:06.236
EXCEPT WE GOT IN A FENDER BENDER
ON THE WAY, AND, UH,

14:06.236 --> 14:09.413
THE OTHER DRIVER--
HE'S GETTING ALL MACHO

14:09.413 --> 14:11.415
AND TRYING TO INTIMIDATE BILL.

14:11.415 --> 14:14.114
AND BILL JUST WENT AT HIM
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

14:14.114 --> 14:18.205
YOU KNOW,
HE REALLY HURT THE GUY.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.033
BROKE BONES.

14:20.033 --> 14:24.341
AND WHEN I TRIED TO STOP HIM,
HE GOT MAD AT ME.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.649
AND WE WENT HOME,
FOUGHT HALF THE NIGHT,

14:27.649 --> 14:31.392
AND I LEFT THE NEXT DAY.

14:31.392 --> 14:36.527
I'M FROM AN ABUSIVE FAMILY,
SO, UH...

14:36.527 --> 14:39.400
[crying] I SEE THAT COMING,
AND I'M OUT THE DOOR.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.534
YOU CATCH THE GUY'S NAME--
THE GUY HE BEAT UP?NO.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.363
DID YOU SEE WHAT KIND OF CAR
HE WAS DRIVING?

14:46.363 --> 14:53.240
I DON'T KNOW. UH...
SOME KIND OF GOLD MUSCLE CAR.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.677
BLACK STRIPES, MAYBE.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.419
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW BILL?

14:58.419 --> 15:02.902
I NEVER REALLY SAW HIM AGAIN
AFTER I LEFT.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.905
HE TRIED TO TALK TO ME,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.386
WHEN HE DIED, HE HAD A NOTE
FOR YOU IN HIS POCKET.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.387
A NOTE?

15:14.348 --> 15:15.566
[whispers] "FORGIVE ME."

15:17.699 --> 15:18.656
AND THIS...

15:21.529 --> 15:22.965
[gasps]

15:24.880 --> 15:27.317
OHH.

15:27.317 --> 15:30.103
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.628
I SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO H-HELP HIM.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.413
YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU,
OKAY?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.552
[crying]

15:48.860 --> 15:51.863
GUY GETS BEATEN UP THAT BAD,
MAYBE HE HOLDS A GRUDGE,

15:51.863 --> 15:53.778
DECIDES TO GO BACK
FOR ROUND TWO.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.694
GUY GETS BEATEN THAT BADLY,
HE GOES TO THE E.R.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.914
CHECK ADMISSIONS
FROM THAT NIGHT.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.873
ALSO CROSS-CHECK D.M.V. RECORDS
FOR GOLD MUSCLE CARS.YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.876
I CHECKED SUTTON'S APARTMENT.
THAT SAFE IN THE CLOSET'S EMPTY.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.878
NO MONEY ANYWHERE.ALMOST 20 GRAND MISSING.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.271
MM-HMM.20 GRAND IS MOTIVE.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.925
HOLWELL'S RUNNING
CASTOR'S FOLLY

16:09.925 --> 16:12.319
AT THE MONTAGUE PINEAPPLE JUICE
STAKES THIS SUNDAY.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.409
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

16:15.409 --> 16:18.412
WELL, IT'S A BIG RACE.
BIG STEP UP FOR HORSE AND RIDER,

16:18.412 --> 16:21.981
RIDER BEING SAM STARKS.THE APPRENTICE. YOU THINK
GETTING TO RIDE COULD BE MOTIVE?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.852
LET'S ASK HER.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.724
ARE YOU SURE YOU JUST DON'T
WANNA GO TO PLAY THE PONIES?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.770
NO PLAYING.
STRICTLY BUSINESS.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.729
SHEEPDIP.I GREW UP AROUND HORSES.
I COULD COME WITH IF YOU--

16:31.729 --> 16:33.731

16:33.731 --> 16:36.691
WHERE SUTTON GOT SUSPENDED
TWO YEARS AGO? THANK YOU.

16:36.691 --> 16:40.869
[telephone ringing in distance]

16:40.869 --> 16:42.871
GET THE HELL

16:42.871 --> 16:45.482
WHOA, WHOA!WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
ANYWAY?

16:45.482 --> 16:46.831
EASY, COBB, OLD BUDDY.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.877

16:48.877 --> 16:51.097

SNEAKING AROUND MY STABLE
SPYING.SPYING? ON YOURHORSES?

16:52.968 --> 16:57.407
LIKE I'D LEARN SOMETHING.
I WAS JUST BEING NEIGHBORLY.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.758
FRANK LOCKHARDT,
OWNER OF AD ASTRA STABLES.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.935
SAY, AREN'T YOU THAT COP
THAT KNOWS ABOUT HORSES?

17:04.935 --> 17:06.068

JANE.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.290
YEAH, I'VE BEEN HEARING
ABOUT THAT TRICK ALL DAY.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.248
VERY IMPRESSIVE.TRICK? IT'S NO TRICK.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.250
I ACTUALLY LISTEN
TO THE ANIMALS.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.165
THEY'RE VERY EXPRESSIVE BEASTS.

17:17.165 --> 17:20.430
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

17:20.430 --> 17:21.736
DOESN'T LIKE YOUR SUIT.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.609
WELL, HOWEVER YOU DID IT,
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CHOICES.

17:26.609 --> 17:28.612
TWO OF THEM WERE MY HORSES.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.440
IT ONLY TAKES ONE HORSE,
LOCKHARDT.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.356
YOU'LL SEE THAT ON SUNDAY.REALLY? THAT DONKEY?

17:33.356 --> 17:35.532
WITH A LITTLE GIRL

17:35.532 --> 17:37.926
[chuckles] YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO PICK 'EM, COBB.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.972
SUTTON WASN'T ANY GOOD EITHER.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO'D HIRE HIM

17:40.972 --> 17:42.713
WAS HOLWELL HERE.TAKE A HIKE, FRANK.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.367
NO DISRESPECT, COBB.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.326
WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU

17:46.326 --> 17:48.415
I MEAN, WITHOUT FOOLS

17:48.415 --> 17:51.896
WHERE WOULD WE BE? CAN'T HAVE
WINNERS WITHOUT LOSERS, RIGHT?

17:51.896 --> 17:53.898
CASTOR'S FOLLY IS GONNA WIN

17:53.898 --> 17:56.466
PRIDE AND LOVE OF THESE ANIMALS
BEATS YOUR MONEY

17:56.466 --> 17:58.686
AND CORPORATE CHARTS
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.COME ON.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.035

18:00.035 --> 18:02.168

18:02.168 --> 18:04.431
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

18:04.431 --> 18:08.304

18:13.440 --> 18:15.094
WATCH IT! HE'LL KICK.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.009
[whinnying, nickering,
and blustering]

18:18.009 --> 18:20.621
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.232
SORRY, MR. HOLWELL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.061
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
HE'S JUST NOT READY.

18:26.061 --> 18:29.673
[nickers]

18:29.673 --> 18:31.284
IS THAT CASTOR'S FOLLY?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.851
NO, IT'S POLLOCK'S DREAM.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.985
IT'S HIS TWIN.

18:36.985 --> 18:39.379
HIS EVIL TWIN.

18:39.379 --> 18:42.730
BUT WE'LL FIX HIM, EVENTUALLY.
RIGHT, SAM?

18:42.730 --> 18:45.472
YES, MR. HOLWELL.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.562
MS. STARKS, I'D LIKE TO
ASK YOU SOME MORE QUESTIONS.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.564
UM, I DON'T KNOW IF...

18:50.564 --> 18:54.133
NO, GO AHEAD, SAM.
TALK TO THE LADY. I GOT THIS.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.053
TWINS.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.664
THAT'S RARE, HUH?

19:03.664 --> 19:07.450
YEP. TEMPERAMENTS ARE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

19:07.450 --> 19:09.931
BUT EACH LIKE THEIR DAM
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.498
[whinnies]HMM.

19:11.498 --> 19:14.065
SOMEDAY THEY'LL BOTH BE
WINNERS LIKE SHE WAS.

19:14.065 --> 19:17.068
IF THIS BASTARD WILL EVER LET
A RIDER ON HIM, THAT IS.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.419
SO FRANK LOCKHARDT'S WRONG
ABOUT YOUR HORSES.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.377
WELL, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT RACING IS, UH,

19:21.377 --> 19:23.423
THE MORE
THEY UNDERESTIMATE YOU,

19:23.423 --> 19:25.990
THE BETTER THE ODDS ARE
WHEN YOU WIN.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.992
THE MORE MONEY YOU MAKE.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.646
AND WIN WE WILL.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.257
MARK MY WORDS.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.302
IT'S GOTTA BE EXPENSIVE,
THOUGH--

19:33.302 --> 19:36.044
THE UPKEEP ON A HORSE THAT
WON'T LET HIMSELF BE RIDDEN.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.003
WELL, PEOPLE SAY I'M AN OLD FOOL
FOR KEEPING POLL AROUND,

19:39.003 --> 19:41.049
BUT SCREW 'EM.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.443
THE BOYS ARE LIKE MIRROR IMAGES
OF EACH OTHER.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.923
THE FLAWS OF ONE ARE
THE STRENGTHS OF THE OTHER.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.882
KEEP 'EM TOGETHER,
AND THEY'LL RUB OFF

19:47.882 --> 19:51.015
ON EACH OTHER.
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.SO THIS ONE...

19:51.015 --> 19:54.280
[blusters]

19:54.280 --> 19:56.847
KEEPS THIS ONE
FROM GOING CRAZY.[nickers]

19:56.847 --> 19:59.241
AND WHAT DOES THIS ONE
BRING TO THE MIX?

19:59.241 --> 20:01.287
OH, HE RUNS LIKE
THE NORTH WIND.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.984
AH.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.294
HELLO THERE.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.864
[whispering indistinctly]

20:13.864 --> 20:15.301
UH-HUH.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.302
MR. JANE?

20:16.302 --> 20:18.129
SHH.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.827
UH-HUH.

20:19.827 --> 20:20.871
OKAY.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.617
REALLY?

20:27.617 --> 20:30.011
[cell phone rings]OH. OH. EXCUSE ME.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.753
[ring]WE'LL TALK AGAIN SOON.

20:32.753 --> 20:36.409
OKAY. GRACE.
GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.020
I GOT THE SCOOP ON
THAT PILE-UP SUTTON CAUSED.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.936
THREE JOCKEYS WERE INJURED--
ONE OF THEM PRETTY BADLY.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.242
AH, THAT'D BE BARNES.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.809
YEAH. HE HAD
MULTIPLE BROKEN BONES

20:45.809 --> 20:48.508
AND SPENT ALMOST A MONTH
IN THE HOSPITAL.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.336
OUCH.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.556
[indistinct conversations]

20:53.556 --> 20:56.559
WITH SUTTON DEAD, YOU'RE GETTING
A BIG BREAK AS A JOCKEY.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.561
MUST BE PRETTY EXCITING,
HUH?

20:58.561 --> 21:01.869
I GUESS. SURE.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.872
COME ON. YOU HAD TO HAVE
KNOWN WITH SUTTON GONE,

21:04.872 --> 21:07.875
THAT HOLWELL WOULD
PROBABLY GO TO YOU.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.485
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:09.485 --> 21:13.228
BILL WAS THE CLOSEST THING
TO A FAMILY I'VE EVER HAD.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.361
I'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO GET HIM BACK.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.146
BUT I CAN'T.
RIDING'S ALL I HAVE.

DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT?THIS IS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.

TO BELIEVE IT.I STILL DON'T GET THE SCHEME.

WHY DIDN'T HOLWELL JUST RUN
THE FAST HORSE?WELL, THE ODDS ARE NO GOOD
ON A FAST HORSE.

38:14.901 --> 38:17.164
EVERYBODY BETS ON HIM.
IT'S PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR.

OH, YOU DID LET SAM STARKS GO,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:16.963 --> 39:18.965

AN INNOCENT PAWN.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.794

SHE'S FREE AND CLEAR.

39:21.794 --> 39:24.623

39:38.724 --> 39:40.769
I HAD TO COVER
EVERY 3-WAY COMBINATION

39:40.769 --> 39:43.990

COST ME $5,000,

39:43.990 --> 39:47.036

39:47.036 --> 39:49.038
SO... YOU CAN'TREAD HORSES?

39:49.038 --> 39:52.433
OF COURSE NOT. BUT IT'S ALWAYS
A GOOD IDEA TO SEEM LIKE

39:52.433 --> 39:54.348
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT. FOSTERS TRUST.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.785
DOES THAT MEAN YOU PUT GRACE
ON A POTENTIALLY WILD HORSE

39:56.785 --> 39:59.614
WITH NO IDEA OF WHAT
COULD HAPPEN?WELL, I HAD AN IDEA

39:59.614 --> 40:01.964

UNDER THE SADDLE.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.836
VERY OLD SCHOOL TRICK.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.447

AND I WAS.YOU TOOK A TERRIBLE CHANCE.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.626
WELL, I FIGURED THE ODDS
WERE 70-30.

40:11.626 --> 40:14.150
I WAS RIGHT.
I WOULDN'T CALL THAT TERRIBLE.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.152
A BETTING MAN
WOULD CALL THAT RISKY,

40:16.152 --> 40:19.721
BUT CERTAINLY NOT TERRIBLE.
WELL...

40:19.721 --> 40:21.941
