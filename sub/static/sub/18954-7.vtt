'We face each day with expectations.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.910
'If we're lucky, they're met,

00:34.960 --> 00:38.950
'if they're not, we must deal
with events as they unfold,

00:39.000 --> 00:44.840
'making good the disappointments,
looking to bind what wounds we can.'

00:53.720 --> 00:56.000
- Would you like a hand, ma'am?
- Thank you.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.710
'Good humour matters,

01:08.760 --> 01:10.430
'optimism matters,

01:10.480 --> 01:11.750
'but we cannot write

01:11.800 --> 01:14.190
'the rules of life and sometimes

01:14.240 --> 01:16.790
- 'courage and resilience...'
- Afternoon.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.560
'.. will matter most of all.'

01:30.520 --> 01:32.440
Midwife!

01:43.120 --> 01:45.280
Afternoon, ladies, come on in.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.640
Take a seat, I'll be with
you in a minute. Hello.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.510
A textbook heartbeat from a textbook baby.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.350
It doesn't feel like a textbook baby

01:57.400 --> 02:00.070
when it's practising its forward
rolls at three in the morning.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.350
Although it certainly
feels like a lively one.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.310
And your fundal height measures
up perfectly with your dates.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.190
I've never stopped praying
for a healthy baby.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.070
I'm just starting to believe
my prayers are being answered.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.790
Shelagh...

02:13.840 --> 02:16.390
it really is important that you relax

02:16.440 --> 02:19.190
and enjoy these last
few weeks of pregnancy.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.350
I know. I'm just not a very
relaxed sort of person.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.920
Has anyone ever given you this leaflet...

02:27.480 --> 02:30.150
.."Breathe Your Way To Serenity"?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.510
Yes, but I didn't read it.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.920
If I were writing a school
report I'd put, "Could do better".

02:40.680 --> 02:43.070
Ah, hello, Mrs Mullucks.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.710
Aw, and look at little Susan.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.150
My mum said she was coming on a treat.

02:48.200 --> 02:53.790
Give her my regards. I need
to see Dr Turner now, please.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.280
Of course.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.190
I wasn't asking the nursery to take
Susan now -- she's only 18 months.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.590
I was just trying to put her
name down for when she's three,

03:09.640 --> 03:11.990
like I put Belinda's
name down, and Perry's.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.190
And Mrs Bathgate refused point blank?

03:14.240 --> 03:17.830
She said she couldn't
take "sick" children.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.710
But did you explain to
her that Susan isn't ill?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.350
I told Mrs Bathgate to speak to you.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.270
She's going to need an education.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.110
The thalidomide didn't
do anything to her brain.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.790
Knock, knock!

03:29.840 --> 03:32.830
I heard you'd popped
in. Is Susan all right?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.750
She's as well as she's ever been.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.550
But I just wish I could
get the rest of the world

03:36.600 --> 03:38.710
to see her through our eyes.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.950
Are you keeping well, Mrs Turner?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.030
Yes, I am.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.310
What you hoping for, boy or a girl?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.150
I don't mind. We have one of each already.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.040
I remember saying that
when I was having Susan.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.270
It's just not convenient
today, Nurse Crane.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.110
I need to have it on a weekday,

03:58.160 --> 04:00.350
between nine in the
morning and four o'clock

04:00.400 --> 04:02.630
while the kids are at school
and Marcus is down the depot.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.310
It's not too late to consider a
hospital delivery, Mrs Antoine,

04:06.360 --> 04:08.230
or the maternity home.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.790
You'd have some privacy and
a bit of peace and quiet.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.430
No.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.870
I can't be doing with all the
whispering and the stares

04:15.920 --> 04:17.990
or the having to explain.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.870
Is that it?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.630
I've been having them on
and off all afternoon.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.910
I think you're safe for now, Mrs Antoine.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.350
These are just Braxton Hicks contractions.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.310
More generally known as a false alarm.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.270
Mum! Mum! Jerome found a bird's nest!

04:36.320 --> 04:39.470
Hello, Akela! Have you
come to born our baby?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.150
Not today, Wesley.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.350
But if Jerome brings that nest to
Cubs for our Treasures From Home

04:44.400 --> 04:47.550
session next week, he might
earn some points for his Six.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.360
Yes!

04:52.320 --> 04:55.310
I was at school with Carrie
Antoine's sister, June.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.070
She came into assembly with her
eyes bright red from crying one day,

04:58.120 --> 04:59.710
and wouldn't say why.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.110
It was my mum who told me Carrie
was going to marry a black man.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.990
No-one can really choose
who they fall in love with.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.950
I certainly don't like some of the
things I've heard said to those

05:09.000 --> 05:10.830
little Antoine lads at Cubs.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.710
They're only repeating
what they've heard at home,

05:13.760 --> 05:16.270
but I've clamped down nonetheless.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.590
Meanwhile, as we try to discuss
lighter matters during recreation,

05:20.640 --> 05:24.150
perhaps I may ask Nurse Franklin
the purpose of her manicure?

05:24.200 --> 05:28.230
I surmise the puller of teeth
is intended to admire it.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.310
Christopher and I are going
out for dinner tomorrow,

05:31.360 --> 05:34.910
and as I've had the day off
beforehand I thought I'd get ahead.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.390
You must ask him to join us for tea.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.800
Perhaps on Guy Fawkes Night.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.870
Is anything special happening
on Guy Fawkes Night?

05:43.920 --> 05:46.750
Sister Winifred has
baked some gingerbread!

05:46.800 --> 05:49.280
It's not in the shape
of a man or anything.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.080
Yes, it's Mullucks. Thank you. Goodbye.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.550
- What have you got there?
- A bassoon.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.590
When did you start learning the bassoon?

06:01.640 --> 06:04.270
There's going to be a joint
orchestra with the girl's grammar.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.950
The only vacancies were
in the woodwind section.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.070
- There aren't many good tunes for
bassoon, Tim. - No, but I get to

06:11.120 --> 06:14.420
sit next to Caroline Gillespie
while I'm playing them.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.870
Will you test me on my French, Mum?

06:20.920 --> 06:24.710
Once Susan's in bed. You'll be
too good for me to test soon,

06:24.760 --> 06:26.860
those words get harder and harder.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.350
Go on.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.150
Mum, Perry's feeding Susan again!

06:33.200 --> 06:36.750
Perry, you know she's
got to do it herself!

06:36.800 --> 06:39.590
It takes her longer, but she has to learn.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.270
Her dinner's going cold, Mum.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.470
We would have been referring Susan

06:56.520 --> 06:59.670
for artificial limb
fitting in January anyway,

06:59.720 --> 07:04.070
but I spoke to them today and
they were happy to see her sooner.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.910
They can give her
artificial legs, already?

07:06.960 --> 07:10.070
Roehampton's working with a
number of thalidomide children.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.990
None of them that much older than Susan.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.830
I just want her to have what my
other kids have got, Dr Turner.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.830
What every child should have.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.670
Just tell them, "Yes."

07:22.720 --> 07:25.520
I'll explain it all to
Bernie when he gets home.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.150
If the artificial silk is
too clingy over pantyhose,

07:32.200 --> 07:35.150
and the Crimplene shift makes
me look like a librarian --

07:35.200 --> 07:38.950
thank you, Valerie -- then I
really only have the ice blue Lurex

07:39.000 --> 07:40.870
and that's still at the dry cleaners.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.070
You can't wear ice blue Lurex
to a week night supper date.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.150
You'll look like you're trying too hard.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.590
Or like you're trying
to match his sports car.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.270
Christopher's sports car isn't ice blue!

07:51.320 --> 07:55.200
It's a sort of pale
Wedgwood with cream accents.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.430
I shall have to go out in the
morning and buy a whole new outfit.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.310
I don't want Susan going
nowhere. Not to hospital,

08:07.360 --> 08:09.630
not to anywhere where she's
going to be prodded and poked.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.430
We've got to start thinking ahead.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.070
- It's been easy until now, Bernie.
- Easy? You call this easy?

08:16.120 --> 08:19.910
Not for us, but for her, for Susan.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.990
What we going to do when
she needs to go to school?

08:22.040 --> 08:23.310
She doesn't need to go to school.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.710
She doesn't need to go
anywhere where we can't go too.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.160
We've got to grab every chance she gets!

08:31.800 --> 08:34.429
We could finish morning
surgery half an hour early --

08:34.480 --> 08:36.669
we've very few appointments in the book.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.270
Then I don't see why you can't
squeeze in your house calls between

08:39.320 --> 08:43.039
11 and half past 12 and drive
them all to Roehampton after that.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.750
I thought you'd tell me that
I had other responsibilities.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.510
That I shouldn't get involved.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.870
When Susan was born,

08:50.920 --> 08:54.510
you sat up all night with
her, thinking she would die.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.390
And you held her in
your arms, and she lived.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.390
You've been involved ever since.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.680
I was involved before that, Shelagh.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.560
I prescribed the drugs that robbed
that child of every single limb.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.080
Science is meant to help, not harm.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.710
Nurse Dyer, would you
test me on my Highway Code?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.030
Yes!

09:22.080 --> 09:24.870
I've just been trying to
sing The Lord's My Shepherd

09:24.920 --> 09:27.830
and all I could think of was
reversing round a side bend.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.190
Little Mrs Sengupta's water's
broke at four o'clock this morning.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.870
Theory's all very well and good,
Sister, but lately, every time

09:37.920 --> 09:42.190
I've offered you a practice drive,
you've made excuses and refused.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.790
I haven't booked my test yet.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.150
You're dragging your feet and
making it worse for yourself.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.270
Action stations for me, too!
Carrie Antoine's gone into labour.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.430
Oh, I have a soft spot for the Antoines.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.910
Can we swap?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.310
Midwife!

10:07.360 --> 10:09.430
Come in, Nurse.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.830
Come on, lass, face out of that eiderdown.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.670
You'll do much better
breathing in some air.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.430
It's the smell of that fried bread.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.950
He always puts that much
bleeding sauce on it.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.150
Off you pop, Mr Antoine, that
forklift truck won't drive itself.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.990
Can't I stay?

10:27.040 --> 10:30.190
You might need an errand running
or maybe someone to hold her hand.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.800
You will be summoned, Mr
Antoine, should the need arise.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.710
It's like when I used to go away to sea.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.190
Just a breath away.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.360
Just a thought away.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.550
My girl. My brave girl.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.520
Thank you.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.520
So, off we go, then!

11:22.760 --> 11:26.480
That's it, Carrie, put
another one behind you.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.520
It's not working, Nurse!

11:32.920 --> 11:34.950
It's run out, that's all.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.830
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.960
I'll ask your neighbour to
telephone Nonnatus House.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.030
"Darling,

11:45.080 --> 11:48.950
"I'm terribly sorry, but something's
cropped up -- no fun for us tonight!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.790
"Could we meet up same time,
same place, on Thursday?

11:51.840 --> 11:53.710
"Best, Christopher."

11:53.760 --> 11:55.910
This is the third time this has happened!

11:55.960 --> 11:58.110
And it was delivered by hand?

11:58.160 --> 12:00.070
I just found it on the doorstep.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.920
He must've run away.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.470
"Best? Best?" What on Earth is
best supposed to mean. Best wishes?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.390
Best of a bad job? Best steer clear?

12:12.440 --> 12:16.510
Perhaps that's the gentleman in
question. Telephoning to apologise.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.430
I'm afraid he's going to have to.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.270
He does start with the
word, "Darling," Trixie.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.630
Men never say, "Darling," unless
they have quite serious intentions.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.510
I had quite serious
intentions about this hairdo!

12:28.560 --> 12:31.390
I didn't spend five shillings
on setting lotion and two hours

12:31.440 --> 12:34.350
in rollers only to spend the
evening knitting with the nuns.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.110
Nurse Crane needs fresh gas and
air and an extra pair of hands

12:37.160 --> 12:39.460
at Mrs Antoine's. I shall hop on my bike.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.830
Oh!

12:47.880 --> 12:50.430
Oh, sorry, Sister. Routine maintenance.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.550
Can you give me ten minutes?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.990
No, not really. It doesn't matter.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.680
I shall quite enjoy a
trot on Shanks' pony. Bye!

13:07.240 --> 13:09.510
This place has been at the forefront of

13:09.560 --> 13:12.630
so many developments in artificial limbs.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.320
It's been the best in its field
since the First World War.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.080
Did you hear that, Bernie?

13:24.480 --> 13:29.270
Douglas Bader, the pilot, was a
patient here during World War II.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.070
Have you seen Reach For The Sky?

13:31.120 --> 13:33.400
Yes! It's a smashing film!

13:34.520 --> 13:36.550
Philip!

13:36.600 --> 13:40.070
Do you want me to put
reins on you, like a pony?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.870
Sorry! Unbroken colt on the loose.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.710
It's nice to see them running about.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.160
Isn't it? As long as you can keep up!

13:49.160 --> 13:52.190
Well, it looks like another
one for our little gang.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.750
There are children with
other problems here, but...

13:55.800 --> 13:58.430
Well, one knows the type.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.550
Good luck.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.910
Come on, darling, right this way.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.630
Hello. You must be the Mullucks family.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.070
And I imagine this is Susan.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.790
Now, the other children are
having some juice and biscuits,

14:11.840 --> 14:13.600
would you like to join them?

14:16.520 --> 14:19.920
There we are. There we go.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.790
You said someone was coming with more gas.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.030
Oh, a couple more of these champion pushes

14:29.080 --> 14:31.470
and we'll have no need
of it when it arrives.

14:31.520 --> 14:35.350
You'll have had this baby by
then, mop of black curls and all.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.830
Can you really see its head?

14:36.880 --> 14:42.350
It's as good as crowned. We're
on the home straight now, lass.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.470
People call my kid's hair frizzy,
but I think it's beautiful.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.550
It looks dandy under a Cub cap.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.550
Oh, no!

14:51.600 --> 14:53.430
You know what to do, Carrie.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.840
Mouth closed, no noise and
your chin on your chest.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.630
Come on! You can do it!

15:07.680 --> 15:09.320
Come!

15:10.760 --> 15:12.160
Gangway!

15:20.440 --> 15:23.470
- Is it out?
- It most certainly is!

15:23.520 --> 15:24.950
Oh, I'm sorry!

15:25.000 --> 15:27.960
Where've you been with that
gas? Mother was in pain!

15:31.460 --> 15:32.940
Yes!

15:35.440 --> 15:37.230
We got a new baby!

15:37.280 --> 15:39.670
What do you think it
is? Another boy for us?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.430
Or a little girl for your mother?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.030
I don't care! Can I play on my bugle now?

15:45.080 --> 15:47.710
Honestly, you'd be surprised how quickly

15:47.760 --> 15:49.830
the kids get used to the appliances.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.790
The little chap who wears
these is coming on a treat.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.510
He's a corker -- he was
picking up Dinky cars

15:55.560 --> 15:58.270
with his artificial arms on last week.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.070
Do they actually walk on the legs?

16:01.120 --> 16:05.030
I-I mean, do they move them one at a time?

16:05.080 --> 16:08.190
Or is it more like a
seat that they sit on?

16:08.240 --> 16:11.550
Well, most of the thalidomides don't
have normal hip or shoulder joints,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.870
so we make each set specially to fit them.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.190
We'd be taking a full plaster
cast of Susan's body to help us.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.240
Ted, can we introduce
Susan's family to Glyn?

16:22.640 --> 16:26.590
Well, goodness me, you do look smart!

16:26.640 --> 16:30.150
I hope you're going to be allowed
to wear these in the garden later.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.470
So, we'll start Susan off on short
legs like Glyn's to begin with.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.150
We call them rockers.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.400
They help the children learn
to balance, don't they?

16:43.900 --> 16:46.080
Erm... Erm

16:48.560 --> 16:50.550
♪ Happy Birthday to you

16:50.600 --> 16:52.390
♪ Happy Birthday to you

16:52.440 --> 16:54.830
♪ Happy Birthday, dear brother

16:54.880 --> 16:57.600
♪ Happy Birthday to you. ♪

17:01.000 --> 17:03.750
Now then, ladies, can I offer
you a small glass of something,

17:03.800 --> 17:05.470
just to wet the baby's head?

17:05.520 --> 17:08.950
Marcus! There's a time and place
for bandying your rum about,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.069
- but it's not here and it's not now!
- Who said anything about rum?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.950
I got a bottle of sherry in, specially.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.950
Thank you, Mr Antoine,
but tea will suffice.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.950
"The cup that cheers,
but does not inebriate."

17:22.000 --> 17:24.630
If you want tea, you can have tea...

17:24.680 --> 17:28.670
with a sherry on the side, just
so you can catch a sniff of it!

17:28.720 --> 17:31.670
Off you go now, lads. Go
and let off some steam.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.910
But you stay in the play
street, do you hear me?

17:33.960 --> 17:36.190
In the play street, and nowhere else!

17:36.240 --> 17:38.240
And make sure you stick together!

17:41.120 --> 17:43.830
Poor Mrs Antoine suffered
far more than was necessary!

17:43.880 --> 17:46.550
If you'd ever seen a baby born
without recourse to pain relief

17:46.600 --> 17:48.950
you'd be a bit more aware of
the difference it can make,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.630
and you'd have stopped at
nothing to get it there.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.510
It would have taken ten
minutes if I'd had my bike.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.110
And it would have taken five if
you'd been behind a steering wheel!

17:58.160 --> 18:01.160
The sooner you pass your
driving test the better.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.680
Get behind that wheel and
get some practice in!

18:17.840 --> 18:20.110
Rhoda wanted to make
sure you were all right.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.030
All right?

18:22.080 --> 18:25.030
How can anyone be all
right after seeing that?

18:25.080 --> 18:28.070
The appliances are quite hard
to look at, I'll give you that.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.910
Not the appliances. Them.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.710
- The other children?
- Yeah.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.710
Them little lads. One with
nothing in his coat sleeves,

18:37.760 --> 18:41.030
the other one shuffling around
on those little wooden feet,

18:41.080 --> 18:43.350
if you could call them that.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.840
I felt sick when I saw them, and
they're better off than Susan.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.640
Is what I felt in there what other
people feel when they see her?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I recommend you dip your clutch.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.000
That was the accelerator!

19:09.880 --> 19:13.600
- And it's mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
- Did I signal first again?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.040
Relax!

19:29.480 --> 19:33.870
For pity's sake, Sister! How many
months have you been learning?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.830
Out. Now.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.880
Before we both find ourselves
in need of gas and air!

19:44.440 --> 19:47.670
Very well, we are aware of your presence!

19:50.040 --> 19:52.240
Get out of the road!

20:05.080 --> 20:08.790
Above all else, a driver needs
common sense and a cool head,

20:08.840 --> 20:10.680
and you have neither.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.430
Lenny!

20:28.480 --> 20:30.320
Can you hear me?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.550
Lenny?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.560
We need an ambulance!

20:57.040 --> 20:58.550
Run!

20:58.600 --> 21:00.880
I've called for an ambulance, Officer.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.750
What's happened, Nurse?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.350
A child's been hit by a car.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.920
Where's the driver?

21:14.120 --> 21:15.720
It was me.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.950
It's quite common for
parents to feel overwhelmed

21:21.000 --> 21:23.350
on their first visit here, Mrs Mullucks.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.830
How many are there?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.470
Patients in our department?

21:26.520 --> 21:31.230
Children... deformed by these pills.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.830
It seems there could
be thousands worldwide.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.960
So far more than 300 have
been identified in Britain.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.550
How many like Susan?

21:43.600 --> 21:46.870
At the moment we believe
that at least 30 are affected

21:46.920 --> 21:48.750
in all four limbs.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.590
Most of their mothers took Distaval

21:50.640 --> 21:52.710
or other medicines containing thalidomide

21:52.760 --> 21:54.870
during the very early weeks of pregnancy.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.630
But why isn't it in the papers more?

21:57.680 --> 22:01.990
I suppose because it's better
that we all concentrate on doing

22:02.040 --> 22:05.040
what's best for Susan, and for you.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.510
We have an assessment place
available from tomorrow for Susan,

22:09.560 --> 22:11.870
if you want to take it.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.600
Tomorrow?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.500
Do you have your car keys
with you, Nurse Crane?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.120
The Constable took them at the scene.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.150
I'll need to take a statement from you

22:29.200 --> 22:32.270
and assess whether there's a case
to put before the magistrates.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.000
The magistrates?

22:36.040 --> 22:39.480
Take a seat, Nurse Crane, I'll see
if we can get you a cup of tea.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.550
Sergeant! My boy, my boy!
He's been hit by a car!

22:54.600 --> 22:56.710
By the time I get there
the ambulance had gone

22:56.760 --> 23:00.390
- and nobody knows which hospital he went to!
- Oh, Mr Antoine...

23:00.440 --> 23:01.790
It was you?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.750
Would you take her into
the side room, please?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.390
Anything to do with the
sherry you was drinking?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.950
Mr Antoine, I did not imbibe.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.270
I poured you a glass, and you accepted it!

23:11.320 --> 23:14.110
Could you arrange for Nurse Crane
to provide a sample of urine?

23:14.160 --> 23:17.270
It will establish whether there's
any alcohol in your system.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.760
I'm sorry, but we'll need to know.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.000
It's all my fault!

23:48.400 --> 23:52.350
If you weren't behind the
wheel you cannot be to blame.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.990
What condition was Lenny in when
they put him in the ambulance?

23:56.040 --> 23:58.590
He was barely conscious.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.430
And pray, what of our colleague?

24:05.480 --> 24:07.800
Thank you for calling, Sergeant.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.680
My hand did not stint in the
application of the sugar.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.590
Patrick! Patrick, stop!

24:32.640 --> 24:34.230
He'll hear you!

24:34.280 --> 24:36.440
I doubt it, over that racket.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.790
All I can say is, Caroline Gillespie
had better be absolutely gorgeous.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.790
I love to see you laugh after a hard day.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.630
Others have had it harder.

24:49.680 --> 24:54.280
And they'll have it harder
for months, years, decades.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.350
I keep looking at the Mullucks
and wishing I could just

25:00.400 --> 25:05.630
write a prescription for a
pill to make everything better.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.790
And then I remember...

25:08.840 --> 25:10.880
that's where it all started.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.870
I'm afraid I have to report the incident

25:22.920 --> 25:26.070
to the General Nursing Council
and the Central Midwives Board.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.750
And I also feel that, for her own sake,

25:28.800 --> 25:31.830
Nurse Crane should stand
down from duties until

25:31.880 --> 25:34.470
- the situation is resolved.
- Resolved?

25:34.520 --> 25:36.990
The police are investigating the accident

25:37.040 --> 25:40.160
and her car has been impounded
until further notice.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.710
I don't want her going anywhere!
Anywhere out of our sights!

25:45.760 --> 25:47.830
It's a week, Bernie, a week!

25:47.880 --> 25:50.430
That's less than when she went
to that children's hospital for

25:50.480 --> 25:51.750
the sweating she used to have.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.750
When she is at home, she's normal.
When she's with us, she's normal.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.710
When she's with Belinda
and Perry, she's normal.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.950
And I don't want 'em taking
her anywhere where they think

25:59.000 --> 26:00.750
that she's a freak that needs fixing.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.030
But she does need fixing! And if
we don't let them try and mend her,

26:04.080 --> 26:05.870
then her life's over before it's begun!

26:05.920 --> 26:09.720
Well, you should have thought of that before
you started taking those bloody pills!

26:27.400 --> 26:29.710
Phyllis?

26:29.760 --> 26:33.280
Is there anything at all I can do to
make things better for you tonight?

26:38.200 --> 26:41.590
I don't think I can
manage much conversation.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.960
No.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.190
Do me hair, Mum?

26:47.240 --> 26:49.670
I'll have to be quick,
Susan's still in her cot.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.070
Plaits or bunches?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.950
Erm, plaits, please.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.430
Mum, what are Susan's
clothes doing on the table?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.800
I'm taking them to be altered.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.680
Children's ward.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.350
Phyllis? Breakfast is on the table.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.990
It's kippers, but Sister
Winifred has poached you an egg.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.830
Tell her that was very thoughtful,

27:37.880 --> 27:40.920
but I'm busy ordering supplies.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.880
Is there any news of the little lad?

27:47.520 --> 27:52.430
Sister Julienne was able to
telephone the Children's Ward.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.800
He has concussion and a fractured femur.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.590
And your notes tell me
that you weighed 9lbs 6oz!

28:11.640 --> 28:13.760
What a bonny boy you are.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.510
Was he your heaviest baby, Carrie?

28:18.560 --> 28:21.430
Lenny was over ten.

28:21.480 --> 28:23.230
My first and worst.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.430
None of them gave me as much gyp as him.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.990
If I could just see him!

28:29.040 --> 28:32.110
If I could just go to the
hospital... and take him his rabbit,

28:32.160 --> 28:33.430
he's had him since he was born,

28:33.480 --> 28:36.910
and he pretends he doesn't
need him any more, but he does.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.990
Carrie, it isn't 24 hours
since you gave birth

28:40.040 --> 28:43.110
and your blood pressure
isn't quite settled.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.470
It's far better that you rest at home

28:45.520 --> 28:47.680
and try to build your strength up.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.550
I thought I was having a girl.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.400
Do you know why?

28:55.800 --> 28:59.310
I couldn't see myself with four boys.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.400
It was as if, deep down, I knew
I'd only have three of them.

29:05.600 --> 29:10.480
And if Lenny doesn't get better, he
puts me back to where I was before.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.070
Three boys, not four.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.000
Not four of anything.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.800
He needs his rabbit.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.430
Hello!

29:26.480 --> 29:29.790
That lovely GP of yours rang
and said you were on your way.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.350
- Can I help you?
- Oh!

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
Hello, Susan.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.470
I was thinking, Sister,
when she gets her arms,

29:42.520 --> 29:46.590
will she be able to put proper
jumpers and cardigans over them?

29:46.640 --> 29:48.870
Only I've been making
things without sleeves

29:48.920 --> 29:51.790
and I thought perhaps I
ought to get knitting?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.190
You'll have to make them in bigger sizes,

29:54.240 --> 29:56.710
but we can measure her once
she's wearing her appliances.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.710
Would you just sign here, Mrs Mullucks?

29:59.760 --> 30:01.070
Yeah.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.070
I'll leave the two of you to say goodbye

30:03.120 --> 30:05.680
and then I'll take her
to the ward, all right?

30:16.440 --> 30:19.280
I'm sorry, Susan. I'm so very, very sorry.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.230
It was pure silk twill with
a handmade rolled edge.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.950
Not Hermes, but something very like it,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.590
and absolutely drenched in
L'Heure Bleu by Guerlain.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.670
L'Heure Bleu? Is that bad?

31:03.720 --> 31:06.510
Suffice to say it's not a perfume
anybody's maiden aunt would wear.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.230
Did you check it for
blood stains or saliva?

31:10.280 --> 31:13.150
Perhaps he gave a patient a
lift home after an extraction.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.110
This isn't funny, Valerie.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.470
Christopher's obviously
involved with someone else.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.310
Nurse Crane.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.590
Sergeant Noakes just telephoned.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.790
He asked that you call in the
police station with your documents.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.390
I told him that I would accompany you,

31:27.440 --> 31:30.390
and he'd like to speak
to Sister Winifred too.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.080
Thank you, Sister.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.990
Nurse Franklin, what about the rabbit?

31:39.040 --> 31:43.240
- Did you get it to Lenny?
- Yes, Phyllis, I did.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.110
And you passed your driving test in 1935?

31:52.160 --> 31:55.030
As soon as it became compulsory.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.270
I'd been driving two years prior to that,

31:58.320 --> 32:00.830
but I prefer to keep things tidy.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.960
Were you self-taught, Nurse Crane?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.720
It was the usual method in those days.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.590
And your insurance documents
all seem to be in order.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.990
Nurse Crane assures me
she's never made a claim

32:15.040 --> 32:17.150
in almost 30 years of driving

32:17.200 --> 32:19.350
and no-one has ever
made a claim against her.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.550
I accept that, Sister Julienne,

32:21.600 --> 32:24.630
but we're still trying to piece
together what happened yesterday.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.430
And it's still possible that
Nurse Crane may face charges of

32:27.480 --> 32:30.790
reckless driving or driving
without due care and attention.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.950
But I'm a member of the
Institute of Advanced Motorists.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.840
We have to deal with the facts.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.790
Why didn't you let us say goodbye?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.790
Aren't we even allowed to visit her?

32:42.840 --> 32:45.310
Children are only allowed at the weekends.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.750
Everybody's got a lot
to do at that hospital.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.950
They don't need brothers and
sisters cluttering up the place.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.680
Did she cry?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.910
When you left her, did she cry?

32:55.960 --> 32:58.030
It's for her own good, Belinda.

32:58.080 --> 33:01.040
It's so she can lead a
proper life, like you!

33:02.400 --> 33:05.080
Dad's going to kill you when he gets home.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.470
There wasn't a trace of
alcohol in her system,

33:14.520 --> 33:15.950
the tests proved that.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.950
We're often offered a drink
to wet the baby's head

33:18.000 --> 33:20.030
and we're absolutely
forbidden to accept it.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.710
But, Sergeant, I'm convinced Lenny
Antoine ran out in front of the car.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.710
- I'd swear to it in a court of law.
- You may have to, Sister.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.350
Sergeant, I think his
brothers saw the accident.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.390
Their names are Wesley and Jerome.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.710
Well, there's no record of
them being at the scene.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.960
They would've run away,
and I believe I know why.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.590
She's ours, Rhoda! You might've
been the first one to say it,

33:40.640 --> 33:43.310
but we've both been saying it
since the day we brought her home.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.270
She's ours! And that means
you don't just get to do

33:45.320 --> 33:48.390
- whatever you like with her.
- I'll tell you what "ours" means.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.430
It means me wearing holes
in the knees of my nylons

33:51.480 --> 33:54.390
trying to teach her how to shuffle
on her bottom on the floor.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.630
It means me trying to stay one step ahead,

33:56.680 --> 33:59.350
trying to work out how she's
going to balance on a potty,

33:59.400 --> 34:01.590
how she's ever going to
pull her knickers up and down

34:01.640 --> 34:04.150
or how she's going to manage
the stairs or hold a pen.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.030
She'll manage. We'll manage.

34:06.080 --> 34:10.670
You do most of your managing
down the Black Sail, Bernie.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.190
Doesn't mean I don't love her.

34:12.239 --> 34:15.190
It's not enough to love her,
we've got to fight for her.

34:15.239 --> 34:18.909
And I don't know how or who the enemy is.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.070
- I left my maths book on the table.
- Take it in the parlour.

34:22.120 --> 34:26.080
No, do your homework here.
Come on, find the right page.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.630
The thing is, lads, sometimes in life

34:32.679 --> 34:34.750
we're told to do things and we don't.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.909
Or we're told not to do things and we do.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.389
And then when things go wrong,
we can't talk about them

34:40.440 --> 34:43.389
because we're scared
of getting into trouble.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.510
And I think...

34:45.560 --> 34:48.510
I don't know, but I think
that something like that

34:48.560 --> 34:50.510
might've happened to you.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.469
I think that maybe your mum told you

34:52.520 --> 34:54.630
you could only stay in the
play street where it's safe.

34:54.679 --> 34:58.350
I say that to them every day. It's
the only place I'll let them play,

34:58.400 --> 35:00.950
and they have to stick together.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.230
Did you disobey your mum?

35:03.280 --> 35:04.870
Did you see the accident

35:04.920 --> 35:08.510
and run away because you were
scared of getting into trouble?

35:08.560 --> 35:11.030
He just ran out. He didn't look.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.630
Why didn't you stay in
the play street, Wesley?

35:14.680 --> 35:18.070
Cars aren't allowed there.
It's all blocked off.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.910
Children were calling us names.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.110
The point is that I tell you
to walk away when they do that!

35:23.160 --> 35:25.470
Marcus, they did,

35:25.520 --> 35:28.480
and that's how they ended
up on the main road.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.350
I don't want Nurse Crane charged.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.830
I don't believe there's
anything we can charge her with.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.160
Good. You can go and tell her that now.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.760
She's a good woman.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.950
Do you mind if I join you, Nurse Crane?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.590
Not at all.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.550
Though it's not as warm as
your fiancee made it out to be

36:00.600 --> 36:03.750
when she insisted I sit out
here for a breath of air.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.750
I think Barbara's just
concerned about you.

36:06.800 --> 36:11.550
Any concern, in this situation,
should be reserved for others.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.270
Those poor little Antoine lads.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.750
Having to run away from other children

36:16.800 --> 36:19.550
because they're being called names.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.270
Lenny Antoine is going
to make a good recovery.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.990
I was with his family earlier today

36:24.040 --> 36:26.750
and they said he may even
be allowed home this week.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.670
His leg will be in a cast
and he'll be on crutches,

36:30.720 --> 36:35.310
which generally makes life
quite exciting for small boys.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.110
There's no virtue in making light of it.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.390
Whether he ran without looking or not,

36:40.440 --> 36:42.950
my lapse could have cost him his life.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.350
You were adjusting your rear-view mirror.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.600
You were doing what any
responsible motorist would.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.110
Mr Hereward,

36:51.160 --> 36:54.260
we don't come at many things
from much the same angle.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.470
You're fond of your meat,

36:57.520 --> 37:00.350
and our views on God and His existence

37:00.400 --> 37:03.990
are divergent to say the least,

37:04.040 --> 37:07.510
but we both follow vocations.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.070
Vocations which in one way or another

37:10.120 --> 37:12.910
are concerned with taking pain away.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.710
I can't disagree with you on that.

37:14.760 --> 37:21.390
So if you caused harm to someone
else, even inadvertently,

37:21.440 --> 37:24.230
would it not make you
question everything your life

37:24.280 --> 37:25.760
has come to stand for?

37:28.120 --> 37:30.030
I'd certainly need to pray about it.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.080
And there you have it, Mr Hereward.

37:34.320 --> 37:39.520
You, a man of faith, would turn
to the Almighty for advice.

37:40.520 --> 37:45.880
I, a rational woman, have
no-one to question but myself.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.310
I couldn't get through to her, Barbara.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.430
Sometimes cheering people on
from the sidelines doesn't help.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.990
Are we done?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.790
You look absolutely flawless.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.070
Just don't go near any naked flames.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.040
If I'm not back within the hour,
you may take it as a good sign.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.590
Where's she off to?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.440
It's best not to enquire.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.070
I thought a stroll in the fresh air

38:15.120 --> 38:17.510
might perk up our appetites before dinner.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.390
Meanwhile, I thought I'd better
put an Eccles cake in my handbag

38:20.440 --> 38:22.230
in case you didn't turn up.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.750
I'm so sorry about the
other evening, Trixie.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.310
- Something... - "Cropped up," was
the phrase you used the other night

38:29.360 --> 38:32.590
and on the two previous occasions.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.550
You think I'm seeing
another girl, don't you?

38:35.600 --> 38:39.280
A blunt question deserves
a blunt answer. Yes.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.840
Well, then...

38:53.440 --> 38:54.950
.. I am.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.630
She's as blonde as you and as
sweet as you and as funny as you,

38:59.680 --> 39:01.630
and I adore her,

39:01.680 --> 39:05.830
but she's six years old
and she's my daughter.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.870
Your daughter?

39:07.920 --> 39:09.480
I'm divorced.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.950
I see.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.750
I married young. It was never
going to last, and it didn't,

39:17.800 --> 39:20.800
but you divorce a wife,
you don't divorce a child.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.390
Why didn't you tell me, Christopher?

39:25.440 --> 39:28.310
Because I was afraid
of what you would think

39:28.360 --> 39:32.190
and because I wasn't sure if we
were going to become close enough

39:32.240 --> 39:34.750
- for it to even be relevant.
- Oh!

39:34.800 --> 39:38.000
- And is it relevant now,
would you say? - Yes.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.030
Do you want to go for a drink?

39:45.080 --> 39:47.440
We can go somewhere out of this wind.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.270
It appears the wind would be the
least of my problems at the moment.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.560
On second thoughts, it's
starting to make my eyes water.

Mrs Clarke's husband just telephoned.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.990
It looks as though those
twins are on their way,

41:05.040 --> 41:06.590
so we're going out to her together.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.710
And that leaves you first on call.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.280
Very well.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.430
If I were you, I'd just go and
sit with Sister Monica Joan.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.390
She's still unravelling old sweaters
from the charity box to knit up

41:19.440 --> 41:22.480
mittens for the poor.
It's not going very well.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.080
May I join you?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.840
Yes, of course.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.390
I think we met a few days ago.

41:43.440 --> 41:46.190
My son Philip came
careering down the corridor

41:46.240 --> 41:47.710
and almost ran you down.

41:47.760 --> 41:51.070
Oh, I remember, the little boy...

41:51.120 --> 41:55.430
Without any arms, yes. And quite
unabashed by their absence...

41:55.480 --> 41:56.840
so far!

41:58.240 --> 42:01.710
Er, I brew myself some coffee
in the Cona every morning.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.270
They only ever have tea here,

42:03.320 --> 42:05.750
and on the bad days I need
all the help I can get.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.510
Can I tempt you to a cup?

42:07.560 --> 42:09.120
I wouldn't mind.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.240
Every time I do this...

42:13.920 --> 42:15.880
.. I'm proud it isn't gin.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.360
Your little girl's an
absolute doll, by the way.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.920
Can I ask if you took Distaval?

42:34.360 --> 42:37.460
I can hardly even remember
swallowing those pills.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.600
But I'm reminded every
single day that I did.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.270
I'm Lydia.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.000
And I'm Rhoda.

42:52.960 --> 42:57.430
I would sooner pound the
treadmill in the workhouse

42:57.480 --> 42:59.160
or pick oakum...

43:00.920 --> 43:04.760
.. than spend another hour
engaged in labour such as this.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.320
There's many will be glad of
what we make when winter comes.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.110
If you do not repair to the telephone,

43:23.160 --> 43:27.430
I shall find myself obliged
to answer it instead.

43:27.480 --> 43:33.110
And the words, "Nonnatus House,
this is not a midwife speaking,"

43:33.160 --> 43:36.960
are most unlikely to reassure the caller.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.390
Do other women say to you,

43:40.440 --> 43:42.950
"I was prescribed them, but I
flushed them down the lavatory"?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.630
Yes! They do, but why
would they have done that?

43:45.680 --> 43:48.630
Nobody knew those pills
could maim a child, not then.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.830
I was given it in cough mixture.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.190
I'd no idea I was even pregnant.

43:53.240 --> 43:56.870
It can't hurt the baby once
you're about eight weeks,

43:56.920 --> 43:58.910
did you know that?

43:58.960 --> 44:00.670
No, I didn't.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.720
You learn new things all the time
when you're in this wretched club.

44:05.080 --> 44:08.270
The drug was licensed in Germany in 1956

44:08.320 --> 44:11.830
and the first deformed
babies were born in 1957.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.830
But Susan was born in 1961!

44:13.880 --> 44:17.470
And Philip arrived in autumn of '59.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.190
The day Princess Margaret got engaged.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.470
It irritates me dreadfully
that I remember that.

44:23.520 --> 44:29.310
Babies were being born with no
arms, no legs, no palate, no eyes,

44:29.360 --> 44:31.950
and those were the children that lived.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.630
And nothing was said. Nothing was done.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.870
Even now there are people who
think there's no case to answer.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.270
That it should just be kept out of sight.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.190
But why was it allowed to
happen in the first place?

44:44.240 --> 44:47.390
I ask myself that every morning...

44:47.440 --> 44:49.120
the moment I open my eyes.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.630
It is unwise to tarry.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.800
Mrs Downley awaits.

45:09.080 --> 45:12.240
- And her home is not nearby.
- No, it isn't.

45:15.120 --> 45:19.630
I surmise you are
unfamiliar with the route.

45:19.680 --> 45:26.070
In contrast, it is not unknown
to me, so I will accompany you

45:26.120 --> 45:28.240
and provide direction.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.720
Nurse, a mother awaits us.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.000
Hello, Bernie.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.880
- It's just a swift half.
- I don't mind.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.800
- It's something else, isn't it?
Something other than... - Susan?

46:18.800 --> 46:21.800
Everything's going to
be about Susan, Bernie.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.760
It's the way things are.

46:27.120 --> 46:31.230
It's like we've moved to a foreign
country and nobody gave us a map.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.000
We're going to have to stick together...

46:35.680 --> 46:37.800
.. or we're just going to get lost.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.840
I'm sorry.

46:46.880 --> 46:49.310
I'm sorry, Rhoda.

46:49.360 --> 46:52.590
I'm making a new rule.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.350
I'm making it, and we're all
going to have to stick to it.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.440
Look at me, Bernie.

46:59.320 --> 47:04.310
Nobody in our family
ever apologises again.

47:04.360 --> 47:08.310
Not to ourselves, not to each other,

47:08.360 --> 47:12.510
not to our beautiful,
beautiful little girl

47:12.560 --> 47:15.990
because we aren't to blame for this.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.710
Other people made those pills.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.830
Other people sold them.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.870
I'm not going to say their names right now

47:23.920 --> 47:26.400
because right now they don't matter.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.520
And we do.

47:39.840 --> 47:43.990
You will be restored to your
bed in a matter of moments,

47:44.040 --> 47:48.030
and the mattress will
thank us for our attention.

47:48.080 --> 47:51.670
It might give them bed bugs something
less to sink their teeth into.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.310
Come.

47:53.360 --> 47:57.840
Let us settle you against these pillows.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.600
Nurse Crane, your patient awaits.

48:08.200 --> 48:12.190
It is better for the midwife
if you lie on your left side.

48:12.240 --> 48:17.190
We no longer insist on left
lateral, Sister. Times have moved on.

48:17.240 --> 48:19.270
I don't feel as though they have.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.270
It's ten years since I had a baby

48:21.320 --> 48:24.230
and nothing feels any better
than it did the last time!

48:24.280 --> 48:28.510
Come, come. Now is the time for courage.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.950
I haven't got any bloody courage!

48:31.000 --> 48:34.600
Like I haven't got any man
worth mentioning again.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.720
Like I haven't got a clue how
I'm going to bring this baby up.

48:44.320 --> 48:48.990
According to my notes,
your first name is Vera.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.550
Vera, when did you last
have something to eat?

48:52.600 --> 48:56.030
Yesterday morning, about seven.

48:56.080 --> 48:59.640
We'll put that right now,
and the rest will follow.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.990
It's not like you, Trix.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.790
Cheering yourself up with
something hot and fattening.

49:13.840 --> 49:17.750
A pan of custard is hardly
a nutritional crime.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.070
Besides, I'm going to pour
it over this sliced banana,

49:20.120 --> 49:22.160
so vitamin C will be involved.

49:30.920 --> 49:34.070
I'd be prepared to overlook
the fact he had a wife.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.030
I'd be willing to accept the
fact that he has a child.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.030
I just find myself stumbling over the fact

49:39.080 --> 49:41.510
that he didn't tell me about either.

49:41.560 --> 49:44.310
Do you think he might have
been afraid of your reaction?

49:44.360 --> 49:47.630
It's the duplicity that
makes me angry, Valerie.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.750
People who have secrets,
they're usually afraid.

49:51.800 --> 49:56.640
Afraid of being laughed at
or rejected or punished.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.880
Prosecuted, even.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.520
Nobody does it for fun, promise you.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.960
Haven't you got any secrets?

50:10.360 --> 50:12.240
That would be telling.

50:17.440 --> 50:21.390
That last little push has
given us the baby's head, Vera.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.950
Labour rewarded.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.870
Naughty monkey's got the
cord looped round its neck.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.760
Nothing to worry about.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.820
You give me another
push when you're ready.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.470
You have a little girl,

50:41.520 --> 50:43.830
and you have been magnificent.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.360
No, Nurse, you have.

50:54.040 --> 50:56.720
- Susan!
- Did you miss us, Susan?

51:07.040 --> 51:10.870
Watch Perry, Susan. Watch how he
bashes his bucket with the spade.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.120
That's it, lift it off, Perry, go on.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.230
That's for you!

51:18.280 --> 51:20.350
I'd make the most of that, if I were you.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.310
It's a whole new game of soldiers
with their artificial arms.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.230
How's Philip getting on?

51:25.280 --> 51:27.870
Oh, he screams the place
down as soon as he sees them.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.790
And what's worse, they keep running
out of gas and getting jammed,

51:30.840 --> 51:32.990
in the most awkward positions.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.750
Can't wait for our turn, can we, Bernie?

51:35.800 --> 51:40.750
Rhoda, I'm taking Philip home today,
but I'd like to keep in touch.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.510
- We're not on the phone.
- We can write.

51:43.560 --> 51:47.990
And, erm, there's going to be a
meeting, for thalidomide parents.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.830
Only half a dozen people, not
everyone wants to join in,

51:50.880 --> 51:53.590
and probably in some
ghastly hall in London.

51:53.640 --> 51:56.670
But do come, both of you.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.920
As long as you put some of
that coffee in your handbag.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.790
You got my note, then.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.590
I wasn't sure if the summons
for Guy Fawkes tea with the nuns

52:12.640 --> 52:16.750
meant I was forgiven or in
worse trouble than before.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.550
And if that sounds flippant
I beg you to forgive me

52:19.600 --> 52:22.270
because I absolutely did not mean it to.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.200
I know.

52:25.400 --> 52:28.790
You're a very sincere man, it seems to me.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.830
And if I was too quick to mistake
your caution for dishonesty,

52:33.880 --> 52:35.830
then the fault's mine.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.000
I should have told you sooner.

52:39.040 --> 52:42.790
Trust unfolds in a
friendship, Christopher.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.150
And just because a friendship
becomes something else

52:46.200 --> 52:49.400
it doesn't mean the trust
should unfold any faster.

52:58.440 --> 53:02.550
Have you heard of an organisation
called Alcoholics Anonymous?

53:02.600 --> 53:04.950
Yes.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.630
I'm a member and I have
been for two years,

53:08.680 --> 53:12.440
and I didn't want to tell you cos
I was afraid of what you'd think.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.390
I don't think anything,
other than good for you,

53:18.440 --> 53:22.200
and I won't be bringing
champagne on any future dates.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.600
Can I kiss you, Trixie?

53:32.000 --> 53:36.270
I wouldn't advise the intermingling
of lips on this particular doorstep,

53:36.320 --> 53:40.320
but you may write our initials
with a sparkler later on.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.670
What are you doing loitering in the hall?

53:46.720 --> 53:50.150
It's your one day off, you should
be studying for your examination.

53:50.200 --> 53:55.030
- I spotted an obituary for
Patsy's father in The Times. - Oh.

53:55.080 --> 53:57.030
He died a fortnight ago in Hong Kong.

53:57.080 --> 54:00.360
- Has she not been in
touch herself? - No.

54:01.760 --> 54:05.280
I'm sure she'll write personally,
as soon as she's able.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.800
I hope so.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.550
Pack! Pack! Pack!

54:13.600 --> 54:16.400
- Pack! - Pack! - Take a seat, boys.

54:19.760 --> 54:23.030
That's quite sufficient, thank you, Abdul.

54:23.080 --> 54:26.630
Tonight we're going to take it
in turns to step up to the front

54:26.680 --> 54:30.270
and show all the other Cubs
our Treasures From Home.

54:30.320 --> 54:35.590
It's a chance to practise our public
speaking and learn new things.

54:35.640 --> 54:38.270
And we're going to start with

54:38.320 --> 54:41.390
Lenny, Wesley and Jerome Antoine

54:41.440 --> 54:44.280
talking about something very important.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.110
This is our baby brother, Delamare.

54:49.160 --> 54:53.030
He was born last week, and
he has pale brown skin like us

54:53.080 --> 54:56.830
because our mum is from Poplar
and our dad is from Jamaica.

54:56.880 --> 55:00.390
Everybody looks a bit like their
mum and a bit like their dad.

55:00.440 --> 55:03.430
You might have blue eyes
like one of your parents

55:03.480 --> 55:06.350
and blonde or ginger
hair like the other one.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.030
Mostly we think Delamare looks like us.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.670
You can come a bit closer, if you like,

55:11.720 --> 55:15.120
and if you're lucky he
might squeeze your finger.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.920
This is our son, Philip.

55:23.240 --> 55:26.030
He was born without arms.

55:26.080 --> 55:29.470
He's coping well with that and
can feed himself using his feet,

55:29.520 --> 55:31.420
which is quite the party piece.

55:32.920 --> 55:36.670
But he's three and he isn't speaking.

55:36.720 --> 55:39.320
The doctors have just
told us that he's deaf.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.560
This is my little girl, Katie.

55:50.280 --> 55:54.390
I took Distaval for morning
sickness before I'd even vomited.

55:54.440 --> 55:58.270
I was just so sick with my other two,

55:58.320 --> 56:00.670
I thought I'd try it in advance.

56:00.720 --> 56:03.350
And Katie's got no eyes,

56:03.400 --> 56:06.270
and no roof to her mouth,

56:06.320 --> 56:10.430
and when I go to see her in
the home I stroke her hands

56:10.480 --> 56:13.000
in a special way and I think she knows me.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.960
Her hands grow out of her shoulders.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.240
Her father's never even been to visit.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.560
This is our little Susan.

56:31.760 --> 56:34.260
18 months, going on 18 years.

56:35.840 --> 56:39.720
She's as clever as they
come, never misses a trick.

56:42.760 --> 56:45.800
And you can see from the
photograph what it did to her.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.560
She's worse off than
some, but she's ours...

56:52.800 --> 56:54.510
.. and she deserved better.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.060
They all deserve better.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.390
But they have us.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.550
'Thalidomide parents had no expectations,

57:03.600 --> 57:08.030
'but they fought for justice
for more than 50 years.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.430
'That fight remains ongoing,

57:10.480 --> 57:12.870
distinguished by its dignity,

57:12.920 --> 57:16.550
'fuelled by anger and by love

57:16.600 --> 57:19.310
'because children must be loved.

57:19.360 --> 57:23.760
'There's no rule of life
so simple or so true.'

57:31.120 --> 57:33.390
I've watched women becoming mothers

57:33.440 --> 57:36.710
for nigh on 30 years, and midwife or not,

57:36.760 --> 57:38.710
you're no different from the rest.

57:38.760 --> 57:40.990
They don't look much different
to aspirin, do they?

57:41.040 --> 57:42.750
When you think what they can do.

57:42.800 --> 57:46.430
Someone knew who I was once,
but it's as if she's vanished.

57:46.480 --> 57:49.590
We need to have her
transferred to hospital.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.070
You've got your work cut out

57:53.120 --> 57:56.280
getting a wedding together
in just three weeks.
