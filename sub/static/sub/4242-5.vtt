<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

00:02.149 --> 00:03.355
<i>McKinley's doing West Side
Story, and everyone's excited,</i>

00:03.417 --> 00:04.849
<i>especially Coach Beiste
and Emma and Artie,</i>

00:04.860 --> 00:06.390
<i>because they're the directors.
Blaine got the lead,</i>

00:06.435 --> 00:08.111
<i>and so did Rachel, which made
Mercedes quit the glee club</i>

00:08.147 --> 00:09.806
<i>and join Shelby's Troubletones
with Santana and Brittany.</i>

00:09.840 --> 00:11.808
<i>Mike Chang's playing Riff,
even though his dad told him</i>

00:11.842 --> 00:13.510
<i>he can't be a dancer.
Riff is perfect for you.</i>

00:13.526 --> 00:15.541
<i>I think he wants him to go to
doctor college or something.</i>

00:15.568 --> 00:16.844
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:19.524 --> 00:21.487
(school bell ringing)

00:22.361 --> 00:25.417
<i>ARTIE: You see this face?
This is what enlightenment looks like.</i>

00:25.476 --> 00:28.250
<i>It doesn't matter if
he's in prison like Gandhi,</i>

00:28.303 --> 00:30.867
<i>or trapped inside a woman's
body like Chaz Bono,</i>

00:30.895 --> 00:32.468
<i>or stuck in a wheelchair
like me,</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:36.854
<i>when a man finds his calling,
all is right in his world.</i>

00:36.888 --> 00:39.307
<i>I still ve performing,
but thanks to Mr. Shue</i>

00:39.352 --> 00:41.601
<i>and the school musical,
I've finally discovered</i>

00:41.654 --> 00:42.843
<i>my true passion...</i>

00:42.877 --> 00:44.185
<i>bossing everyone around.</i>

00:44.219 --> 00:45.763
<i>I mean directing.</i>

00:45.825 --> 00:47.397
<i>The key to being a director</i>

00:47.441 --> 00:48.996
<i>is having opinions
about everything.</i>

00:49.016 --> 00:50.079
No.

00:50.106 --> 00:51.490
<i>Even stuff you have no id.</i>

00:51.523 --> 00:53.115
No.
I think it's great.

00:53.156 --> 00:54.571
Go.

00:54.616 --> 00:55.998
Definitely.
Really?

00:56.037 --> 00:57.002
That's it.
No.

00:57.035 --> 00:58.442
That's it.

00:58.499 --> 01:00.114

02:08.154 --> 02:09.852
Are you going to cry
every time we sing?

02:09.887 --> 02:11.244
I'm such a girl.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.069
My only note is more teeth.

02:13.102 --> 02:14.835
Can I be honest?

02:14.857 --> 02:16.506
This song is about
sexual awakening,

02:16.535 --> 02:18.832
as is the entire musical.

02:18.862 --> 02:21.325
You two lack passion.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.347
Have either of you two
actually...?

02:25.416 --> 02:27.373
Wow, okay. I have to go.
Because I have...

02:27.416 --> 02:29.131
Those footballs aren't going
to inflate themselves.

02:29.165 --> 02:30.682
I'm out of here.
Let's go.

02:30.709 --> 02:33.254
Look, I remember my
first time with Brittany.

02:33.288 --> 02:35.774
The excitement, the way it
made me feel like a man...

02:35.776 --> 02:39.230
even though she called me
the wrong name like four times,

02:39.276 --> 02:40.718
during and after.

02:40.771 --> 02:42.353
What was it like for you guys?

02:44.905 --> 02:46.787
Um...

02:46.820 --> 02:48.669
I'm, I'm waiting
for the right time.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.106
Yeah. Yeah, me-me, too.

02:50.149 --> 02:51.308
I'm so glad that
you're my Tony.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.736
Look...

02:52.790 --> 02:55.295
as your friend I support
your strange aversion to fun.

02:55.297 --> 02:57.371
But as your director,
I'm concerned.

02:57.404 --> 02:58.785
I'm, I'm sorry,
what do you mean?

02:58.888 --> 03:00.372
Well, how do you expect
to convey

03:00.430 --> 03:01.985
the human perience
to an audience

03:02.019 --> 03:04.506
when you haven't even opened
yourself up to one of humanity's

03:04.540 --> 03:06.235

03:17.929 --> 03:19.419
Um... one over there.
Um...

03:21.759 --> 03:23.092
So, you, um...

03:23.141 --> 03:25.211
you still haven't told me
who you're ving for yet.

03:25.224 --> 03:28.425
Well, I haven't decided.
Kurt's my brother.

03:28.492 --> 03:29.884
It's kind of hard to vote
against your brother.

03:29.903 --> 03:31.774
Well, I mean, you can't do
this with your brother.

03:37.901 --> 03:39.895
Not unless you
live in Kentucky.

03:39.912 --> 03:41.793
(giggles)
What's gotten into you?

03:41.827 --> 03:44.325
Nothing. It's just the
confidence of success.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.369
I mean, I sold out
the April Rhodes Auditorium

03:46.403 --> 03:48.928
for three shows, Jacob Ben
Israel's poll have me in tied

03:48.955 --> 03:50.715
for first place in
the presidential race,

03:50.749 --> 03:52.463
and I have
the hottest guy in school.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.383
I hope that my radiance
isn't too much for you.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.464
It won't be after Friday night.
What's Friday night?

03:56.521 --> 03:57.847
That is the day
that the recruiter

03:57.883 --> 03:59.227
from Ohio State is coming.

03:59.261 --> 04:00.290
They're looking for
a new quarterback.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.212
Really?
That's amazing!

04:02.246 --> 04:04.646
Yeah, I know.
You... you're not pissed?

04:04.697 --> 04:06.477
No. No, of course not.

04:06.541 --> 04:10.290
It's not like NYADA
has a football team.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.027
It's really happening.

04:13.141 --> 04:15.364
You know, our dreams are coming
true, and we're growing up.

04:15.398 --> 04:17.026
I know.

04:17.028 --> 04:18.728
And... hey,
I was thinking.

04:18.778 --> 04:22.323
Um, Burt and my mom are
out canvassing all week

04:22.333 --> 04:23.743
and I have the house to myself.

04:25.551 --> 04:26.689
Maybe you could come over.

04:26.691 --> 04:28.854
To your house?

04:32.602 --> 04:33.863

04:52.608 --> 04:54.690

want to build

04:54.726 --> 04:56.891
a time machine just so
I can go back to the '70s

04:56.949 --> 04:58.615
and give Brian Ferry
a high five.

04:58.648 --> 05:00.603
Do you think I'm boring?
Are you crazy?

05:00.652 --> 05:02.649
You're the single
most interesting kid

05:02.683 --> 05:05.358
in all of Ohio.
I mean, like...

05:05.367 --> 05:06.902
sexually.

05:06.951 --> 05:08.579
I mean, we are playing
it very safe by

05:08.691 --> 05:11.080
not granting our hands visas
to travel south of the equator.

05:11.119 --> 05:13.211
Oh, I-I thought
that's what we wanted.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.252
It is.
I'm just wondering,

05:15.285 --> 05:16.742
have you ever had
the urge just to

05:16.776 --> 05:18.322
rip off each other's clothes
and get dirty?

05:18.356 --> 05:21.214
Uh, yeah. But that's why
they invented masturbation.

05:21.251 --> 05:23.578
It's so hot in this room. Could
we, could we open up a window?

05:23.651 --> 05:27.199
Hey, I'm serious. We're young.
We're in high school.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.706
Yeah, we have urges, but

05:29.718 --> 05:34.342
whatever we do, I want to make
sure that you're comfortable.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.642
So I can be comfortable.

05:36.974 --> 05:38.389
And besides,

05:38.404 --> 05:41.732
tearing off all of your clothes
is sort of a tall order.

05:41.768 --> 05:43.018
Because of the layers?

05:43.052 --> 05:45.398
Because of the layers.

05:51.070 --> 05:52.701
Man, I love to weld.

05:52.735 --> 05:55.216
Clearly.
Coach, I'm concerned.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.138
Why did you run out of
rehearsal the other day

05:57.178 --> 05:58.370
when we started
talking about S-E-X?

05:58.404 --> 06:00.574
Artie, this conversation
is totally inappropriate.

06:00.579 --> 06:02.588
Wait.

06:05.008 --> 06:07.129
Have you never...?

06:07.190 --> 06:08.723
Why? Have you just never
found the right...

06:08.757 --> 06:10.709
person?
Guy. I like guys.

06:10.743 --> 06:13.145
And no, I haven't found him.

06:14.405 --> 06:16.516
All right, I'll play.

06:16.629 --> 06:18.862
There's this
one gentleman.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.416
He's the bee's knees.

06:20.418 --> 06:22.871
His name's Cooter Mankins.

06:22.905 --> 06:24.982
He's a recruiter
for Ohio State.

06:25.035 --> 06:28.480
<i>He's beautiful. He makes me
feel like a girl...</i>

06:28.542 --> 06:29.798
<i>but he's not interested.</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:32.775
You're a hell of a coach, Coach.
So much talent.

06:33.948 --> 06:35.542
I'm famished.
Want to go get some lunch?

06:35.587 --> 06:36.866
Nah.

06:36.903 --> 06:38.878
But you can have
the rest of my chili.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.215
There's nothing left but
gristle and a few beans,

06:41.256 --> 06:42.827
but it eats pretty good.

06:42.871 --> 06:46.084
So, anyway, that's my type.

06:46.118 --> 06:47.509
Not that it matters.

me if you guys could come.

10:15.051 --> 10:17.289
I-I need to ask.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.517
Why did you leave Dalton?

10:18.551 --> 10:22.169
Were you bored with all
the preppies around here?

too many hearts to stay?

10:37.421 --> 10:39.844
¶ Stick to your own kind ¶

10:39.879 --> 10:41.478
(laughs)

10:41.513 --> 10:42.974
Uh, it wasn't like that.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.268
Let's just say that

10:44.316 --> 10:45.485
I miss Dalton every day,

10:45.487 --> 10:48.297
but McKinley is
where my heart is, now.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.885
¶ A boy like that wants
one thing only ¶

10:51.919 --> 10:54.895
¶ And when he's done,
he'll leave you lonely ¶

10:54.929 --> 10:58.652
¶ He'll murder your love;
he murdered mine ¶

10:58.702 --> 11:00.109
¶ Just wait and see ¶

11:00.164 --> 11:01.227
¶ Just wait, Maria ¶

11:01.261 --> 11:04.289
¶ Just wait and see ¶

11:04.318 --> 11:08.954
¶ Oh, no, Anita, no, Anita, no ¶

11:08.992 --> 11:11.749
¶ It isn't true, not for me ¶

11:11.783 --> 11:14.136
¶ It's true for you,
not for me ¶

11:14.173 --> 11:16.842
¶ I hear your words,
and in my head ¶

11:16.899 --> 11:19.096
¶ I know they're smart ¶

11:19.130 --> 11:20.499
¶ But my heart, Anita ¶

11:20.551 --> 11:25.310
¶ But my heart knows
they're wrong ¶

11:25.348 --> 11:27.851
¶ You should know better ¶

11:27.908 --> 11:31.027
¶ You were in love,
or so you said ¶

11:31.229 --> 11:36.594
¶ You should know better. ¶

11:36.628 --> 11:39.413
I have to go
to lacrosse practice,

11:39.415 --> 11:42.036
but could we meet again?

11:42.075 --> 11:45.406
I could really use some more
insights from you, Blaine.

11:46.386 --> 11:49.133
You know, Warbler to Warbler.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.103
Sure.

12:03.875 --> 12:04.879
(bell ringing)

12:04.918 --> 12:06.990
Hey, dude, I got
a question for you.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.009
I thought they were my sneakers.

12:08.038 --> 12:09.008
BOTH:
What?

12:09.033 --> 12:10.848
No, no, look, I figured since

12:10.877 --> 12:13.012
you have some more experience

12:13.046 --> 12:17.330
than I do, you could
recommend a brand of condom.

12:17.734 --> 12:18.796
Are you cheating
on Rachel, dude?

12:18.814 --> 12:19.657
Because if you are,
that is not cool.

12:19.904 --> 12:20.700
And that's coming from me.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.541
No. I want to use them
with Rachel.

12:22.591 --> 12:25.213
Oh. I'm happy for you, dude,
and her.

12:25.271 --> 12:26.725
I always thought it would be me,

12:26.769 --> 12:28.107
but secretly hoped
it'd be you.

12:28.136 --> 12:30.445
As for the condoms,
no idea... never used them.

12:30.476 --> 12:32.033
It's worked out
for me about 99% of the time.

12:32.071 --> 12:34.117
(blows whistle)
Gather round!

12:35.825 --> 12:38.478
You all know Cooter Mankins.
Best eye for talent

12:38.505 --> 12:39.730
in the country if you ask me.

12:39.765 --> 12:42.442
Which is why I spend so much
time with you, Coach.

12:42.486 --> 12:46.509
Hey, are those new
tube socks?

12:46.553 --> 12:49.688
I got a whole new six-pack
if you need to borrow a pair.

12:49.790 --> 12:51.326
(clears throat)

12:51.372 --> 12:53.644
All right,

12:53.702 --> 12:58.786
this Friday night I will be in
the stands watching you play.

12:58.810 --> 13:01.840
And I'm not looking for boys
to play for the Buckeyes.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.323
I'm looking for men.

13:06.713 --> 13:08.676
(bell ringing)

13:08.705 --> 13:10.632
If you see any of Rachel's
campaign posters

13:10.666 --> 13:13.109
feel free to tear
them down.

13:13.141 --> 13:15.729
Do you think we're
too sheltered as artists?

13:15.731 --> 13:17.762
I'm serious.

13:17.822 --> 13:19.748
<i>West Side Story's all about
living outside</i>

13:19.819 --> 13:21.281
of your safe little world.

13:21.315 --> 13:23.900
Don't you want to wake up
every day and be adventurous?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.020
Experience everything
in life you can?

13:26.047 --> 13:28.299
Of course, it's why
I made a bucket list.

13:28.419 --> 13:29.570
Okay, you ready for this?

13:29.571 --> 13:30.138
Okay.

13:30.182 --> 13:30.895
All right, here you go.

13:30.921 --> 13:33.411
Number 87: become CEO of Logo.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.264
Of course.

13:34.308 --> 13:37.891
Number 63: lay a rose at the
birthplace of Noel Coward.

13:37.915 --> 13:38.822
Okay, number five.

13:38.830 --> 13:40.120
All right, this one's
really embarrassing.

13:40.137 --> 13:41.290
I wrote this before
I met you.

13:41.325 --> 13:43.868
Have relations on a dewy meadow
of lilac

13:43.885 --> 13:45.583
with Taylor Lautner
before he gets fat.

13:46.845 --> 13:48.367
Oh, yeah, I know, it's stupid.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.255
No, it's not. It's hot.

13:51.309 --> 13:54.275
Well, anyway,
we're-we're young,

13:54.311 --> 13:57.861
so we've got all the time in
the world to be adventurous.

13:57.862 --> 14:00.773
Don't you think now is the
time to be adventurous

14:01.096 --> 14:03.296
while we're still young?

14:10.486 --> 14:11.568
(bell ringing)

14:11.916 --> 14:14.178
Excuse me, Mr. Cooter,

14:14.277 --> 14:15.649
I'm Artie Abrams.

14:15.684 --> 14:18.023
Could I see you in my office?
It's important.

14:18.035 --> 14:20.707
You don't mean the handicapped
stall, do you?

14:20.756 --> 14:23.549
Uh, no. But that is hilarious.

14:26.873 --> 14:28.902
Holy hell!

14:28.916 --> 14:30.632
What is this, a movie
theatre or something?

14:30.681 --> 14:31.683
You like Coach Beiste, right?

14:31.715 --> 14:32.923
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

14:32.929 --> 14:34.525
She's the best
football coach in the state.

14:34.559 --> 14:36.951
Yeah, but do you like her,
like her?

14:41.864 --> 14:45.033
You know, I've asked her out
about a million times.

14:45.168 --> 14:46.738
She's not interested.
Last week I told her

14:46.842 --> 14:48.770
I had a gift
certificate to Applebee's.

14:48.772 --> 14:50.628
She told me fancy restaurants
make her nervous.

14:50.662 --> 14:51.625
You have to ask her out again.

14:51.659 --> 14:54.068
No way, Andy.
She's gonna blow me off.

14:54.111 --> 14:55.230
Trust me.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.235
You need to ask her out again,

14:58.304 --> 14:59.556
but make it really obvious.

15:01.028 --> 15:03.082
I have the perfect idea
for a date.

15:03.129 --> 15:04.567
I can't believe you asked

15:04.591 --> 15:07.215
for a shot of Courvoisier
in your coffee.

15:07.244 --> 15:08.892
I forget how lame
this town is.

15:09.770 --> 15:10.986
When I lived in Paris,

15:11.039 --> 15:12.905
I drank it like it was
mother's milk.

15:12.939 --> 15:14.283
When...?

15:14.302 --> 15:15.617
Oh, okay, wow.

15:15.638 --> 15:16.183
What?

15:16.191 --> 15:18.123
You're just so, you know,
you're out there.

15:18.154 --> 15:20.809
And your whole bashful
schoolboy thing?

15:20.843 --> 15:22.703
Super hot.

15:22.734 --> 15:25.398
Look, Sebastian,
I have a boyfriend.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.050
Doesn't bother me
if it doesn't bother you.

15:27.071 --> 15:29.565
No, I mean, I really care
about him.

15:29.593 --> 15:30.702
He doesn't need to know.

15:30.736 --> 15:32.081
I'd just never want to mess

15:32.098 --> 15:34.477
my thing up with him in any way.

15:34.524 --> 15:36.194
He's really great.

15:36.225 --> 15:37.058
Who's really great?

15:37.092 --> 15:38.644
You!

15:38.699 --> 15:40.537
We were just talking
about you.

15:40.568 --> 15:44.586
Sebastian, this is Kurt,
my boyfriend, who I was just...

15:44.620 --> 15:46.641
Got it.
Wow. Wow.

15:47.610 --> 15:48.399
Pleasure.

15:49.976 --> 15:52.089
And how do we know
Sebastian?

15:52.113 --> 15:53.337
We met at Dalton.

15:53.385 --> 15:54.591
Was dying to meet Blaine.

15:54.624 --> 15:56.216
Those Warblers just won't
shut up about him.

15:56.277 --> 15:58.177
Didn't think he could
live up to the hype,

15:58.204 --> 15:59.950
but as it turns out...

15:59.983 --> 16:03.382
Yes, he's even more impressive
in the flesh.

16:03.413 --> 16:05.985
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

16:06.019 --> 16:08.380
Well, we're rehearsing
for the school musical.

16:08.405 --> 16:09.853
And then, at bedtime,

16:09.887 --> 16:12.340
we do a rigorous skin-sloughing
regimen over the phone together.

16:12.376 --> 16:15.174
And as sexy as that sounds,

16:15.220 --> 16:17.121
what do you say
we shake things up?

16:17.152 --> 16:18.934
I get you guys
a couple of fake IDs

16:18.936 --> 16:20.561
and we head over
to Scandals in West Lima.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.270
Scandals?
That's the gay bar.

16:22.292 --> 16:23.771
The last time
I was there,

16:23.793 --> 16:26.677
I met the man of my dreams on
the dance floor.

16:26.722 --> 16:27.651
That's so sweet.

16:27.701 --> 16:28.916
And are you two
still together?

16:28.950 --> 16:30.503
Sadly, no.

16:30.515 --> 16:32.676
We broke up about
20 minutes after we met.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.091
Come on, guys.

16:34.122 --> 16:35.094
Live a little.

16:35.116 --> 16:36.699
We would love to,
Sebastian.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.559
Thank you for the offer.
That's very nice of you,

16:39.613 --> 16:42.644
but that just isn't
our kind of thing.

16:42.646 --> 16:43.824
Let's do it.

16:43.858 --> 16:46.810
What? Yeah.
We have a whole bunch of firsts

16:46.836 --> 16:48.521
to start crossing
off our list.

16:48.555 --> 16:49.668
We're in.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.027
Great.

16:51.062 --> 16:52.400
Great.

16:55.274 --> 16:57.626
(Rachel sighs)

16:57.660 --> 16:59.544
That was amazing.

16:59.578 --> 17:02.152
I've never had
meat substitute before

17:02.207 --> 17:03.548
that tastes that
much like real meat.

17:03.735 --> 17:05.659
Of course.
Because you're a vegan,

17:05.693 --> 17:07.554
which I remember because we know
each other so well.

17:07.604 --> 17:08.632
More sparking cider?

17:08.675 --> 17:10.790
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.144
Should we make a toast?

17:12.163 --> 17:13.157
Yeah.
All right.

17:13.198 --> 17:17.348
To four full months
of no fighting

17:17.349 --> 17:19.675
or threats of us breaking up.

17:19.678 --> 17:21.161
Nothing but love, love, love.

17:26.515 --> 17:27.959
BOTH:
Cheers.

17:32.090 --> 17:33.676
Oh, should I go
make dessert?

17:33.710 --> 17:36.029
I've got pound cake.
It's Sara Lee.

17:36.063 --> 17:39.761
Oh, actually I thought maybe we
could just go snuggle

17:39.763 --> 17:41.102
by the fire first.

17:44.788 --> 17:47.201
Okay.

18:06.864 --> 18:08.810
I brought protection.

18:08.812 --> 18:10.071
Me, too.

18:10.142 --> 18:11.483
Every modern girl
comes prepared.

18:16.192 --> 18:17.919
Wait, wait.
Before we do this,

18:17.926 --> 18:20.762
I need to know, why now?

18:20.778 --> 18:23.118
The last time we talked
about this, you said

18:23.120 --> 18:24.696
you wanted to wait
until you won a Tony.

18:24.735 --> 18:26.470
Or any other major award.
Emmy, Golden Globe.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.293
People's Choice would have
gotten you to third base.

18:28.295 --> 18:29.758
But I don't know what changed.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.101
I mean, even the thought

18:32.135 --> 18:33.980
of going to New York a virgin
felt silly to me.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.418
But when and who's gonna feel

18:35.619 --> 18:36.912
more right than you and now?

18:36.914 --> 18:38.759
And I love you.

18:44.826 --> 18:47.219
I just want to make sure this is
special enough for you.

18:47.246 --> 18:48.531
I've been saving up
for a hotel for us.

18:48.664 --> 18:52.014
Someplace nice like a Marriot
or something.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.606
If we wait a couple of weeks,
I could probably...

18:53.712 --> 18:55.049
No, I can't wait
a couple weeks.

18:55.104 --> 18:57.151
I have to get this done before
opening night.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.568
Get this done?

18:59.614 --> 19:03.337
I can't play airl
who has a sexual awakening

19:03.363 --> 19:04.771
if I'm not woken up myself.

19:04.974 --> 19:08.198
So you're doing this
so you can act better?

19:08.239 --> 19:11.045
No! No! I'm doing this
because I love you

19:11.067 --> 19:13.126
<i>and so that I can act better.</i>

19:13.164 --> 19:14.414
But that's
my business, okay?

19:14.448 --> 19:17.979
It has nothing to do
with you, so...

19:18.002 --> 19:19.268
Where are you going?

19:19.302 --> 19:21.827
No, no, I'm-I'm ready.
Please come back.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.210
I-I just need a minute.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.881
I'm gonna make dessert.

19:43.082 --> 19:43.900
When were you
gonna tell me?

19:43.934 --> 19:46.200
- Tell you what?
- That you're doing the school musical.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.638
I overheard your mother
talking about it on the phone.

19:48.672 --> 19:51.292
You lied to me, and you made
a liar out of your mother.

19:51.326 --> 19:53.425
You will quit immediately.

19:53.466 --> 19:55.806
No!
I love being a dancer.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.859
When I was in high school
I wanted to be a tennis player,

19:58.861 --> 20:00.647
but then I had to wake up
and realize that

20:00.681 --> 20:01.774
I wasn't good enough.

20:01.828 --> 20:03.129
Grow up, Michael!

20:03.163 --> 20:04.917
You need to learn the difference

20:05.040 --> 20:06.530
between grown-up dreams
and kid dreams.

20:06.564 --> 20:08.763
I'm not going to be a doctor.

20:10.173 --> 20:12.341
I will be a professional dancer.

20:12.366 --> 20:14.325
I'll pay my own way
through college.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.617
I don't want your money.

20:15.642 --> 20:17.695
As long as you continue
to waste your life

20:17.729 --> 20:19.407
with this silly fantasy,

20:20.841 --> 20:23.850
you will no longer be my son.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.972
Then I guess I don't have
a dad anymore.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.642
(bell ringing)

20:42.000 --> 20:43.250
Need somebody to spot you?

20:43.500 --> 20:44.711
No, I'm good.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.212
I lift big and solo.

20:47.254 --> 20:49.218
You'd be surprised how much
I could bench.

20:49.260 --> 20:50.875
If I got the chance.

20:50.927 --> 20:52.215
Gotcha.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.711
I'll be through
here in a sec,

20:54.836 --> 20:56.982
and then
they're all yours.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.792
Did you need me for something?

20:59.929 --> 21:02.958
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I, uh...

21:03.642 --> 21:05.146
I got these.

21:05.190 --> 21:06.689
Are you going to a graveyard?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.753
No, no, I got them for you.
I'm not sick.

21:08.807 --> 21:11.227
Dang it, Shannon, can you just,
can you drop the weights,

21:11.340 --> 21:13.393
please,
and talk to me for a second?

21:20.891 --> 21:22.362
Man, you ever just have
something

21:22.396 --> 21:23.924
you really wanted to get out,

21:23.958 --> 21:25.820
and you just
couldn't seem to do it?

21:25.859 --> 21:28.357
I had a chigger in
my thigh once.

21:28.391 --> 21:30.325
It was the size of a Tic Tac.

21:30.448 --> 21:32.827
I want to take you out
on a date.

21:32.889 --> 21:36.255
A real honest-to-God sit-down
date where you dress up

21:36.368 --> 21:39.087
like a lady and I dress up
like a gentleman.

21:39.117 --> 21:42.584
Yes or no?

21:42.773 --> 21:44.709
Why are you doing this, Cooter?

21:46.231 --> 21:47.422
Somebody put you up to this?

21:47.446 --> 21:50.135
Geez.

21:50.255 --> 21:52.450
Why don't you get
that I'm attracted to you?

21:52.458 --> 21:53.972
Because you're the kind of man

21:54.042 --> 21:56.363
that could have any pretty girl
he pointed at,

21:56.365 --> 22:01.637
and I don't look the way
pretty girls look.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.726
Well, good...

22:03.760 --> 22:06.626
'cause I don't date girls.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.388
I just date women.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.107
Beautiful women.
Like you.

22:15.271 --> 22:17.151
So, take the flowers.

22:17.329 --> 22:19.139
Go on.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.001
(sighs)

22:24.951 --> 22:27.584
So, Friday...

22:27.618 --> 22:28.822
after the game.

22:30.271 --> 22:31.807
(door opens)

22:31.822 --> 22:33.398
(sniffles)

22:36.983 --> 22:38.603
This emergency meeting is now in
session.

22:38.637 --> 22:40.234
Now I realize that we are a
house divided,

22:40.272 --> 22:41.614
but I need the advice
of my girls.

22:41.648 --> 22:43.914
The last time I called a meeting
like thiwas during

22:43.948 --> 22:46.496
our Madonna lesson, and all of
you were wildly unhelpful.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.914
But it's been two years now,
and we've all grown up,

22:48.958 --> 22:50.424
so I'm optimistic.

22:50.609 --> 22:54.247
Finn and I were...
almost intimate.

22:54.294 --> 22:56.162
Almost? What happened?
He ran out.

22:56.196 --> 22:57.964
I just... I wanted my
performance of Maria

22:57.998 --> 23:00.176
to be as realistic as possible
and when he found out that

23:00.178 --> 23:02.689
that's why I was doing it,
he got really, really hurt.

23:02.722 --> 23:04.620
Of course he was hurt.
Yeah, that's really bad, Rachel.

23:04.654 --> 23:07.630
I know. I know. I feel terribl
And now I realize that I was

23:07.664 --> 23:09.486
just doing it for
all the wrong reasons.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.050
Do you want my advice?

23:11.084 --> 23:12.650
Just wait.
Just wait?

23:12.684 --> 23:15.351
Look what happened to me.
You could've used protection.

23:15.385 --> 23:17.411
I'm not just talking about
getting pregnant, I'm-I'm

23:17.608 --> 23:20.693
talking about losing something
that you can never get back.

23:20.695 --> 23:23.715
It changes you.
It makes everything more complicated.

23:23.731 --> 23:26.043
I also think that
you should wait.

23:26.045 --> 23:28.751
Speaking from experience,
Finn is terrible in bed.

23:28.785 --> 23:30.441
Santana, that is not cool.
Oh, what?

23:30.443 --> 23:33.560
If Rachel wants my sloppy seconds,
she should at least know the truth.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.889
Look, it was like being
smothered by a sweaty,

23:35.923 --> 23:37.497
out-of-breath sack of potatoes

23:37.531 --> 23:38.769
that someone soaked
in body spray.

23:38.933 --> 23:40.712
I lost my virginity at
cheerleading camp.

23:40.716 --> 23:43.719
He just climbed into my tent.
Alien invasion.

23:43.828 --> 23:46.213
Okay, well, then I guess
it's settled.

23:46.231 --> 23:49.041
Obviously, things are heating up
between Finn and I.

23:49.064 --> 23:51.415
But I think we should wait.

23:51.449 --> 23:55.423
Losing my virginity was a great
experience for me...

23:55.457 --> 23:57.183
because I was with
someone I love.

23:57.217 --> 24:02.090
¶ I have a love ¶

24:02.212 --> 24:06.900
¶ And it's all that I have ¶

24:06.924 --> 24:09.727
¶ Right or wrong, what else ¶

24:09.740 --> 24:11.724
¶ Can I do? ¶

24:11.747 --> 24:13.198
<i>TINA:
It happened this summer.</i>

24:13.232 --> 24:15.236
Mike and I had talked
about it for awhile,

24:15.351 --> 24:17.208
because we knew that
the first time was gonna be

24:17.242 --> 24:18.427
something we'd want
to remember forever.

24:18.429 --> 24:21.079
¶ I love him ¶

24:21.114 --> 24:24.438
¶ I'm his ¶

24:24.474 --> 24:28.932
¶ And everything he is ¶

24:28.960 --> 24:32.181
¶ I am, too... ¶

24:32.210 --> 24:34.100
And when that
moment came...

24:34.102 --> 24:35.620
we just knew.

24:35.802 --> 24:36.985
It was right.

24:37.157 --> 24:39.163
It wasn't rushed.

24:39.193 --> 24:40.564
It was amazing.

24:40.598 --> 24:47.439
RACHEL AND SANTANA:
¶ When love comes so strong ¶

24:47.444 --> 24:53.456
¶ There is no right or wrong ¶

24:53.489 --> 24:57.957
¶ Your love is... ¶

24:57.963 --> 24:59.806
He's my first love.

24:59.848 --> 25:01.961
And I'll always look back at
that moment as

25:02.077 --> 25:05.767
absolutely perfect...
no regrets.

25:05.801 --> 25:10.009
¶ Your life... ¶

25:25.905 --> 25:27.607
KURT:
Chazz Donaldsworth?

25:27.661 --> 25:28.838
This doesn't even
look like me.

25:28.852 --> 25:30.667
Don't worry.
Mine says I'm 38.

25:30.788 --> 25:33.006
They'll work.
Okay.

25:33.013 --> 25:36.021
(ABC's "Poison Arrow" plays)

25:40.200 --> 25:41.417
Aloha!

25:44.077 --> 25:46.399
Enjoy.

25:46.469 --> 25:48.683
It's Drag Queen Wednesday.

25:48.700 --> 25:49.743
Great.

25:53.871 --> 25:56.558
It's not very scandalous...

25:56.604 --> 25:58.297
Au contraire.

25:58.335 --> 26:00.325
Look at all the, uh,
glamorous drag queens.

26:00.359 --> 26:04.534
Look, there's uh, Cher and
Tina Turner and, uh, uh...

26:04.536 --> 26:06.754
is that Lucy or Reba?

26:06.811 --> 26:10.382
<i>That is Ginger from
Gilligan's Island.</i>

26:10.437 --> 26:13.216
KURT:
Of course.

26:13.224 --> 26:16.591
¶ Then I say "I love you"
and foul the situation... ¶

26:16.654 --> 26:17.806
I really don't
like that guy.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.872
He's harmless.

26:18.890 --> 26:21.892
A beer for Blaine,

26:21.911 --> 26:25.155
and for Kurt, a Shirley Temple
with extra cherries.

26:25.224 --> 26:27.152
I heard you're the
designated driver.

26:27.189 --> 26:28.329
Like, all the time.

26:28.363 --> 26:29.826
Cheers, boys.

26:29.894 --> 26:31.995
To the glamorous life.

26:32.029 --> 26:35.279
¶ I thought you loved me,
but it seems you don't care ¶

26:35.334 --> 26:40.256
¶ I care enough to know I can
never love you ¶

26:40.281 --> 26:44.755
¶ Who broke my heart?
You did, you did... ¶

26:45.846 --> 26:48.052
You better watch
your boyfriend.

26:48.086 --> 26:50.037
Could I get another
beer, please?

26:50.071 --> 26:53.580
(Thelma Houston's "Don't Leave
Me This Way" plays)

26:53.693 --> 26:55.585
So, how's life
at your new school?

26:55.599 --> 26:58.682
Fine.

27:00.884 --> 27:03.621
Look, I just want to have a
normal senior year and play

27:03.655 --> 27:05.987
football without my teammates
hearing rumors about me.

27:06.051 --> 27:09.604
Just so that you know, I would
have never told anyone.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.532
It's not who I am.

27:14.069 --> 27:16.700
So, you come here
all the time?

27:16.743 --> 27:21.259
People like me here.
I feel accepted.

27:21.293 --> 27:23.179
I'm what they call a bear cub.

27:23.210 --> 27:24.603
Because you look like Yogi?

27:24.637 --> 27:27.621
I don't know, because
I'm burly or something.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.436
So... so is this the point
where you judge me?

27:32.470 --> 27:37.327
No, as long as you're not
beating people up, I am all for

27:37.345 --> 27:39.974
being whoever you have to
be at your own speed.

27:40.096 --> 27:45.178
¶ Oh, baby,
don't leave me this way ¶

27:45.233 --> 27:48.263
Right now, I'm just trying
to get through high school.

27:48.297 --> 27:50.100
¶ I can't exist ¶

27:50.134 --> 27:51.819
¶ I'll surely miss ¶

27:51.821 --> 27:53.528
Here's to baby steps.

27:53.592 --> 27:55.135
¶ Your tender kiss
Baby steps. ¶

27:55.171 --> 27:58.086
¶ Don't leave me this way ¶

27:59.832 --> 28:05.649
¶ Baby, my heart is full of love
and desire for you ¶

28:05.667 --> 28:09.838
¶ Now come on down and do what
you gotta do ¶

28:09.876 --> 28:14.010
¶ You started this fire down in
my soul ¶

28:14.042 --> 28:17.167
¶ Now can't you see it's burning
out of control? ¶

28:17.176 --> 28:19.005
BLAINE: This was the
best night of my life.

28:19.051 --> 28:20.348
Okay. All right.
It's the best night of my life.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.348
I want to live here.
I want to live here.

28:22.387 --> 28:23.889
And I just want to make art

28:23.940 --> 28:25.505
and you know, just help people.

28:25.525 --> 28:28.513
(laughs) You could certainly help
people make fires with your breath.

28:28.521 --> 28:30.283
Hey, come on,
I only h one beer.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.277
Sure, you did.
Hey.

28:31.316 --> 28:32.275
What?
Kiss me. Kiss me.

28:32.317 --> 28:33.789
Oh, no, no, no, no...
Come on...

28:33.815 --> 28:35.695
Come on, you're riding
in the back. Come on.

28:35.738 --> 28:36.906
Lay down.
All right, all right.

28:36.956 --> 28:38.112
You're less likely to
throw up that way.

28:38.152 --> 28:39.283
Get in there.

28:39.324 --> 28:40.790
Whoa, wait! Okay...
(stammering)

28:40.819 --> 28:43.150
All right, Blaine, all right.
Cold hand, cold hand!

28:43.184 --> 28:44.403
Come on, come on.
Hey, Kurt, let's just do it.

28:44.458 --> 28:45.794
I... I want you.
No, no...

28:45.837 --> 28:48.525
I want you so...
No, Blaine, no, just... Stop it...

28:48.548 --> 28:51.427
Hey, listen, I-I know you wanted
to do it in a field of lilacs

28:51.466 --> 28:54.007
with Sting playing in the background and
all that, but who cares where we are?

28:54.041 --> 28:56.344
It's all about us, right?
Right, it's about us.

28:56.378 --> 28:58.346
Which is why I don't want
to do it on a night

28:58.380 --> 29:00.215
that you spent half of
dancing with another guy

29:00.389 --> 29:02.374
and that you're sober enough
to remember it the next day!

29:02.408 --> 29:05.878
Why are you yelling at me? Because I have never
felt less like being intimate with someone

29:05.904 --> 29:08.317
and either you can't tell
or you just don't care.

29:08.358 --> 29:09.844
(sighs)

29:11.120 --> 29:12.040
Where are you going?

29:12.059 --> 29:14.720
I'm sorry if I'm trying to
be spontaneous and fun.

29:19.201 --> 29:21.411
I think I'm just
gonna walk home.

29:22.832 --> 29:23.563
Blaine!

29:25.069 --> 29:26.779
(sighs):
God!

29:39.184 --> 29:41.749
(audience murmuring)

29:45.065 --> 29:47.502
Just so you know, your
Maria has disappointed you.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.438
I'm still a virgin.

29:50.728 --> 29:52.892
And your Tony has
disappointed you.

29:52.901 --> 29:54.437
- Me, too.
- Look, the audience is smart.

29:54.472 --> 29:57.232
The only sensible solution is to
just cancel the show.

29:57.242 --> 30:00.560
I'd rather send everybody home than
give a false, inauthentic performance.

30:00.562 --> 30:02.167
Five minutes!

30:02.190 --> 30:05.729
Rachel, darken your eyebrows.
Blaine, tone down the blush.

30:05.744 --> 30:07.907
My eyebrows are fine.

30:20.765 --> 30:23.704
Artie? Artie, are you okay?
You look upset.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.255
Everything is wrong.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.245
The scenery, the costumes,
the staging.

30:27.256 --> 30:29.240
You know, I thought if I just
pretended like I knew

30:29.291 --> 30:31.012
what I was doing I could lie my
way through it,

30:31.066 --> 30:32.906
but in five minutes that curtain
is going to go up

30:32.940 --> 30:35.612
and everybody is going to know
that I'm a fraud.

30:35.614 --> 30:37.575
Artie, you were brilliant.

30:37.609 --> 30:40.714
Really, this show is absolutely amazing,
and that is all thanks to you.

30:40.917 --> 30:44.702
It's awful.
I let everybody down.

30:44.722 --> 30:46.944
Hey, Artie, some of the cast needs
to talk to you before we go on.

30:48.572 --> 30:50.275
See? It's mutiny.

30:50.311 --> 30:52.444
Dude, we have a problem.

30:52.491 --> 30:56.478
We haven't officially thanked you for
everything that you've done for us.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.122
All of us were so nervous, and we
didn't know what we were doing

31:06.143 --> 31:09.841
and you were like the lighthouse
that lead us to the way.

31:09.903 --> 31:11.713
But I didn't know what I was
doing, either.

31:11.715 --> 31:16.817
When you're in a chair,
it hard to...

31:18.587 --> 31:20.424
ever feel
like you've grown up.

31:20.458 --> 31:24.195
Everyone's always doing stuff
for you,

31:24.237 --> 31:26.339
they get freaked out about
saying the wrong thing,

31:26.399 --> 31:29.222
so... they coddle you.

31:29.266 --> 31:30.686
Sometimes it's hard to ever
picture a life

31:30.800 --> 31:33.422
of being totally
self-sufficient.

31:33.439 --> 31:35.890
But directing you ys,

31:35.990 --> 31:38.233
the way you trusted me,

31:38.283 --> 31:42.582
the way you looked at me
and listened to me,

31:42.635 --> 31:44.627
it was the first time in my life
that I ever...

31:44.661 --> 31:47.007
felt like a grown man.

31:48.293 --> 31:51.486
That's the greatest gift
you can give a guy, so...

31:51.519 --> 31:54.155
So, thank you guys...

31:54.171 --> 31:57.668
for the flowers and for
everything.

31:57.678 --> 31:58.917
All right, show circle.

31:58.956 --> 32:00.151
(relieved laughter)

32:00.172 --> 32:01.322
May I, chief?

32:01.344 --> 32:03.920
Let's kick some ass!

32:04.031 --> 32:05.709
(collective cheer)

32:12.511 --> 32:15.524
When I think about how we came
to America!

32:15.557 --> 32:17.778
Like children! Believing!
Trusting!

32:17.800 --> 32:20.338
Ah, trusting with our hearts
open...

32:20.347 --> 32:21.679
With our arms open...

32:21.715 --> 32:23.387
(Irish accent): You
came with your mouth open.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.303
We gotta work on this
kid's diction.

32:26.337 --> 32:29.660
Without a doubt, the best
musical McKinley's ever done.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.306
We'll see. It's a risky artistic
choice weaving the Jets

32:32.308 --> 32:34.143
into "America,"
but Artie insisted.

32:34.177 --> 32:36.034
(Latin music plays)

32:36.065 --> 32:38.644
I just hope that people go with
it, you know?

32:38.678 --> 32:42.154
¶ Puerto Rico ¶

32:42.188 --> 32:45.319
¶ My heart's devotion ¶

32:45.353 --> 32:49.822

32:51.358 --> 32:56.293
¶ Always the hurricanes
blowing ¶

32:56.327 --> 33:01.500
¶ Always
the population growing ¶

33:01.534 --> 33:04.215

33:04.249 --> 33:07.544

33:07.556 --> 33:10.222
¶ And the natives steaming ¶

33:10.255 --> 33:13.843
¶ I like the island Manhattan ¶

33:13.877 --> 33:15.012
I know you do!

33:15.046 --> 33:17.935
¶ Smoke on your pipe ¶

33:17.979 --> 33:20.715
¶ And put that in ¶

33:24.398 --> 33:26.684
¶ I like to be in America ¶

33:26.718 --> 33:28.988
¶ Okay by me in America ¶

33:29.023 --> 33:31.241
¶ Everything free in America ¶

33:33.525 --> 33:35.394
(all shout)

33:37.275 --> 33:40.033
¶ Lots of new housing
with more space ¶

33:40.067 --> 33:44.085
¶ Lots of doors slamming
in our face ¶

33:44.119 --> 33:46.455
¶ I'll get
a terrace apartmt ¶

33:46.502 --> 33:49.285
¶ Better get rid
of your accent ¶

33:49.337 --> 33:52.256
¶ Life can be bright
in America ¶

33:52.292 --> 33:54.740
BOYS:
¶ If you can fight in America ¶

33:54.759 --> 33:56.873
GIRLS:
¶ Life is so bright in America ¶

33:56.907 --> 34:00.466
¶ If you're all-white
in America ¶

34:03.963 --> 34:06.352
¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

34:06.382 --> 34:08.417
¶ La-la, la-la-la,
America ¶

34:08.436 --> 34:10.639
¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

34:11.471 --> 34:13.780
¶ America! ¶

34:17.228 --> 34:19.761
¶ Here you are free
and you have pride ¶

34:19.775 --> 34:21.980
¶ Long as you stay
on your own side ¶

34:23.599 --> 34:25.230
¶ Free to be anything
you choose ¶

34:25.264 --> 34:27.867
¶ Free to wait tables
and shine shoes ¶

34:29.271 --> 34:31.286
¶ I like to be in America ¶

34:31.322 --> 34:33.703
¶ Okay by me in America ¶

34:33.762 --> 34:35.445
¶ Everything free in America ¶

34:35.472 --> 34:38.576
¶ For a small fee in America ¶

34:38.610 --> 34:40.280
¶ I like to be in America ¶

34:40.293 --> 34:42.447
¶ Okay by me in America ¶

34:42.464 --> 34:45.123
¶ Everything free in America ¶

34:45.149 --> 34:47.000
¶ For a small fee in America ¶

34:47.049 --> 34:49.119
¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

34:49.134 --> 34:51.551
¶ La-la,

¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

34:54.342 --> 34:57.791
¶ La-la,
la-la-la, America! ¶

34:57.793 --> 35:02.486
(cheering, shouting)

35:16.013 --> 35:19.669
How are we, as virgins,
supposed to follow that?

35:21.676 --> 35:24.324
Tony and Maria
were soul mates, okay?

35:24.342 --> 35:27.334
Against all odds,
they found each other.

35:27.382 --> 35:29.656
I know what that's like.

35:29.672 --> 35:31.282
And you do, too.

35:32.707 --> 35:35.104
So we just have
to play that, okay?

35:35.147 --> 35:36.487
We, as actors,

35:36.510 --> 35:37.722
have to tap into that.

35:39.427 --> 35:41.268
Okay?

35:53.221 --> 35:56.107
(quiet whooshing)

36:00.100 --> 36:01.524
Shouldn't you be celebrating?

36:02.224 --> 36:03.809
I'm going over this move.

36:03.863 --> 36:05.051
I messed it up tonight.

36:05.085 --> 36:06.555
I know I can do it better.

36:06.589 --> 36:08.527
Beauty of the stage...

36:08.575 --> 36:10.527
we get to do it all over again
tomorrow night.

36:12.927 --> 36:14.091
Personally, I thought both of
you guys were perfect.

36:14.114 --> 36:16.208
Thank you.

36:16.327 --> 36:17.781
Your Officer Krupke killed.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.718
Brought the house down.

36:19.755 --> 36:22.133
Well, I can't help
but pull focus, sorry.

36:22.135 --> 36:23.451
Don't apologize.

36:23.486 --> 36:25.488
It was great.

36:27.023 --> 36:29.804
All your friends
were here tonight.

36:29.806 --> 36:31.647
The Warblers...
Sebastian...

36:33.501 --> 36:35.972
They were all loving it.

36:35.974 --> 36:37.818
Come here.

36:37.848 --> 36:40.234
Give me your hand.

36:41.985 --> 36:43.515
Hold it to your heart.

36:43.558 --> 36:45.967
Just like the song?
Like the song.

36:47.018 --> 36:49.478
Kurt...

36:49.574 --> 36:53.313
Sebastian doesn't mean
anything to me.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.653
And you were right...

36:56.661 --> 36:58.873
our first time
shouldn't be like that.

36:58.987 --> 37:03.133
I was drunk and... I'm sorry.

37:03.167 --> 37:05.164
Well, sure beats the
last time you were drunk

37:05.204 --> 37:06.375
and made out with Rachel.

37:06.428 --> 37:07.790
(sighs)

37:07.824 --> 37:09.865
(both laughing)

37:09.925 --> 37:11.974
But I'm sorry, too.

37:12.008 --> 37:14.338
I wanted to be your
gay bar superstar but...

37:14.379 --> 37:18.679
try as I might, I'm still
just a silly romantic.

37:18.865 --> 37:20.994
It's not silly.

37:24.502 --> 37:26.298
You take my breath away.

37:26.332 --> 37:28.524
Not just now;
tonight on that stage.

37:28.564 --> 37:30.226
I was so proud
to be with you.

37:30.273 --> 37:32.190
I hope so.

37:33.398 --> 37:35.545
I want you to be.

37:39.204 --> 37:42.977
Um... Artie's having
an after party at Breadstix.

37:42.996 --> 37:45.840
Would you... accompany me?

37:45.874 --> 37:48.050
No.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.774
I want to go to your house.

37:50.814 --> 37:53.089
Okay.

37:53.144 --> 37:55.714
(dogs barking in distance)

38:00.031 --> 38:01.472
(knocking)

38:04.010 --> 38:05.167
Hi.

38:08.291 --> 38:10.254
I got your flowers.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.303
They were beautiful.

38:13.305 --> 38:14.749
You were really good.

38:16.178 --> 38:17.103
Can I come in?

38:17.138 --> 38:18.741
Yeah.

38:24.562 --> 38:26.029
Where is everybody?

38:26.063 --> 38:27.615
Kurt's out with Blaine,

38:27.685 --> 38:30.455
and Burt and Carole left
for Toledo right after the show.

38:30.510 --> 38:32.006
They got some kind of
meet-and-greet in the morning,

38:32.048 --> 38:34.096
so... spending the night.

38:36.447 --> 38:39.081
Why didn't you stay for
the after party?

38:39.203 --> 38:41.575
I mean, I know that you're still
mad at me abouthe other night.

38:41.609 --> 38:43.220
He didn't like me.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.489
What? Who?

38:45.542 --> 38:47.227
The recruiter.

38:47.261 --> 38:48.836
<i>He watched the game and then</i>

38:48.838 --> 38:50.388
<i>I waited like an idiot
for 20 minutes</i>

38:50.422 --> 38:52.622
<i>while he talked to Shane.</i>

38:52.624 --> 38:54.400
<i>I didn't even shower
or change out of my uniform,</i>

38:54.434 --> 38:55.944
<i>because I was afraid
I'd miss him.</i>

38:58.194 --> 39:01.175
So you guys
are going after Shane?

39:01.209 --> 39:02.429
Kid's a monster.

39:03.696 --> 39:05.122
Look, kid,

39:05.154 --> 39:07.348
just 'cause your football career
ends in high school,

39:07.397 --> 39:09.991
it doesn't mean
your life does.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.938
Wait... I don't,
I don't understand

39:11.967 --> 39:14.152
what any of this means.
It means I suck!

39:14.187 --> 39:16.650
It means I'm gonna
be stuck here forever.

39:16.657 --> 39:18.437
Cooter's not
gonna recruit me!

39:18.471 --> 39:20.418
He said I...
I'd reached my ceiling.

39:20.452 --> 39:22.098
There are other colleges.

39:22.132 --> 39:24.638
Like there are other schools
for you besides NYADA?

39:24.665 --> 39:26.065
I'm not good enough!

39:26.117 --> 39:27.292
I'm not a good enough
quarterback

39:27.311 --> 39:29.201
to get a scholarship!

39:29.250 --> 39:30.590
I'm not a good enough singer
to get into NYADA!

39:30.624 --> 39:32.342
It's all over for me!

39:32.344 --> 39:33.296
Stop it!

39:33.307 --> 39:34.894
Finn, look at me.

39:34.928 --> 39:37.830
Your dreams are
not dead, okay?

39:37.864 --> 39:38.711
You've just
grown out of them.

39:38.748 --> 39:40.494
You have to find
new ones now.

39:40.598 --> 39:41.832
I don't know how.

39:41.866 --> 39:43.405
Then we'll figure
it out together.

39:44.530 --> 39:45.458
You're special.

39:45.492 --> 39:47.489
You know how I know that?

39:47.613 --> 39:49.157
Because I'm going
to give you something

39:49.215 --> 39:50.858
that no one else is
ever gonna get.

39:55.432 --> 39:58.372
You... You don't need
to do this, okay?

39:58.374 --> 39:59.654
The play's over.
There's no point.

39:59.656 --> 40:02.838
No, the point is, is that
I was wrong and stupid

40:02.874 --> 40:04.742
and immature, and probably
not for the last time,

40:04.744 --> 40:06.861
lost in my ambition and...

40:06.863 --> 40:07.955
And now?

40:09.658 --> 40:10.995
Now I'm just a girl,

40:11.029 --> 40:14.029
here with a boy
that she loves,

40:14.031 --> 40:16.009
and wanting to
remember this moment

40:16.011 --> 40:18.342
for the rest of her life.

40:26.360 --> 40:29.493
With this ring, I thee wed.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.640
With this ring, I thee wed.
