02:14.735 --> 02:18.206
LIV, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HEARD FROM JESSIE STURGIS?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.940
- JESSIE...

02:19.973 --> 02:21.575
THE SINGLE MOM WHO WAS RAPED
IN THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.377
- YEAH,
THAT WAS LABOR DAY WEEKEND.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.812
THAT STILL HASN'T
GONE TO TRIAL YET, RIGHT?

02:24.845 --> 02:29.583
- THE D.A.'S OFFICE
HATED THAT CASE.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.220
SHE WAS DRUNK,
AND HER STORY WAS A MESS.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.256
- BUT SHE WAS RAPED.
- I'M NOT ARGUING THAT.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.690
- SHE KNEW HER ASSAILANT,
I REMEMBER.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.359
SHE WAS AFRAID THAT
HER BOYFRIEND WOULD FIND OUT.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.261
- OKAY,
HER BOYFRIEND, TOMMY,

02:40.294 --> 02:44.365
LAST NIGHT, JESSIE WAS ARRESTED
FOR KILLING HIM.

02:44.398 --> 02:48.236
A.D.A. BARBA

03:54.535 --> 03:56.737
UNDERNEATH,
SHE'S ALL STEEL.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.507
- SO WHY IS SHE RUSHING
TO CHARGE JESSIE?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.709
I MEAN,
IF JESSIE DID SHOOT TOMMY,

04:01.742 --> 04:02.976
IT HAD TO BE
SELF-DEFENSE.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.512
- HE APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN UNARMED,

04:04.545 --> 04:05.879
AND SHE BROUGHT A GUN
TO THE SCENE.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.981
THAT'S AN ODD SCENARIO
FOR SELF-DEFENSE.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.485
- BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT'S THIS
GOT TO DO WITH OUR RAPE CASE?

04:11.519 --> 04:12.986
- JUST GOING TO ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.655
WALK ME THROUGH IT.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.590
- FOUR MONTHS AGO,

04:16.624 --> 04:19.293
JESSIE STURGIS WAS RAPED
BY A MICHAEL PROVO.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.495
- PROVO'S SIDE,
IT WAS CONSENSUAL SEX,

04:21.529 --> 04:24.498
AND SHE LIED 'CAUSE SHE WAS
AFRAID OF HER BOYFRIEND.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.734
- TOMMY BANDOLCE.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.969
THE GUY THAT JESSIE'S ACCUSED
OF MURDERING LAST NIGHT?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.771
- RIGHT.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.774
- THAT'S WHY MS. JAMES
WANTS TO SEE YOUR CASE.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.310
SHE WANTS BACKGROUND
ON JESSIE.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.612
SHE'S ALSO WORRIED PROVO
WAS FALSELY ACCUSED.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.047
- DID SHE TELL YOU
THAT MICHAEL PROVO

04:40.080 --> 04:42.483
IS A C.I.
FOR THEIR OFFICE,

04:42.516 --> 04:43.717
HELPED MAKE HER THE D.A.?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.453
SHE'S JUST LOOKING TO PROTECT
HER OWN.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.754
- DIDN'T COME UP.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
EITHER WAY, SHE WANTS US
TO OPEN OUR KIMONO.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.591
- EXCUSE ME?
- SHE WANTS TO SEE

04:50.624 --> 04:52.760
ALL OF OUR CASE WORK,
ALL THE D.A.'S FILES.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
- SO SHE CAN BUILD A CASE
AGAINST JESSIE.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.397
I ASSUME
YOU TOLD HER NO.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.532
- DETECTIVE, THERE'S
A PROTOCOL AMONG D.A.s.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.667
I CAN'T JUST SAY NO.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.435
I TOLD HER
I WAS NEW TO THE OFFICE

05:01.469 --> 05:02.836
WHEN THE CASE BROKE,
AND I NEEDED TO GET UP TO SPEED,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.973
SO GET ME UP TO SPEED.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.808
LABOR DAY WEEKEND.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.877
LOCAL PRECINCT
GOT THE FIRST CALL?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.845
- NO, EMS.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.382
JESSIE HAD BEEN OUT PARTYING
WITH HER GIRLFRIENDS,

05:14.415 --> 05:18.018
SHE COLLAPSED ON THE STREET.
SHE WAS TAKEN TO MERCY HOSPITAL.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.520
- WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.889
- THE VIC'S NAME
IS JESSIE STURGIS.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.525
EMS PICKED HER UP,
SEMI-CONSCIOUS ON GANSEVOORT.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.893
- WELL,
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.128
- WELL, SHE WAS PRETTY
OUT OF IT. SHE WAS DRUNK.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.863
SHE TOLD THEM
THAT SHE'D BEEN RAPED.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.367
NOW, I FOUND THIS RECEIPT
IN HER BAG TO BABAR'S DEN,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.068
TIME-STAMPED
TWO HOURS AGO.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.070
FIN AND ROLLINS
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.906

05:50.484 --> 05:52.786
WHO COMES IN HERE,
THINKS SHE CAN DRINK LIKE A MAN.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.954
WINDS UP SCREAMING
"WOO-HOO."

05:53.987 --> 05:57.758
HER FRIENDS STARTED TO HOOK UP,
SHE LEFT.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.627
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DROVE.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.795
- SHE WAS ASSAULTED
AFTER SHE PAID HER TAB.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.631
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CUT HER OFF?

06:03.664 --> 06:06.800
- THIS PLACE IS STRICTLY
BOTTLE SERVICE, AT THE TABLE.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.935
COMPLETELY
OUT OF MY HANDS.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.703
- DID YOU SEE HER
LEAVE WITH ANYONE?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.740
- NAH, BUT SHE WAS
ON HER CELL PHONE WHEN SHE LEFT.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.742
LOOK, I'M SORRY
SHE WAS ASSAULTED,

06:14.775 --> 06:16.043
BUT THAT'S NOT

- NEVER IS, IS IT?

06:19.513 --> 06:22.082
- DETECTIVES? WHY?
I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.051
- JESSIE,
BEFORE YOU PASSED OUT,

06:24.084 --> 06:26.587
YOU TOLD EMS
THAT YOU'D BEEN ASSAULTED,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.423
AND THE RAPE KIT
CONFIRMS TRAUMA.

06:29.457 --> 06:33.861
- RAPE KIT?
I DON'T REMEMBER.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
NEVER MIND,

06:35.763 --> 06:36.864
MATTHEW'S WAITING UP FOR ME.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.733
- MATTHEW,
YOUR LITTLE BOY.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.935
HIS PICTURE'S

06:41.969 --> 06:44.672
- WHY WERE YOU
LOOKING THROUGH MY PHONE?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.740
- WE'RE COPS.
YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.209
WE NEEDED TO FIND
AN EMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBER.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.612
- YOU DIDN'T CALL TOMMY?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.714
- TOMMY?
TOMMY BANDOLCE.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.949
NOW, THAT'S THE NUMBER
THAT YOU HAD LISTED.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.887
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.956
- UH, I GOT TO GO.
IF HE SEES ME LIKE THIS, HE'S--

07:02.990 --> 07:04.191
- OKAY, HOLD ON, JESSIE.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.793
JESSIE,
YOU HAVE A FACE FULL OF BRUISES.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.828
YOU HAVE
INTERNAL INJURIES.

07:07.861 --> 07:11.832
NOW, WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS ALL A BLUR.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.736
- THAT CAN HAPPEN.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.872
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?
WHO YOU WERE WITH?

07:18.906 --> 07:21.975
- UH, YEAH, I--

07:22.009 --> 07:23.944
WELL, TOMMY AND I
HAD A FIGHT TODAY,

07:23.977 --> 07:26.814
SO I WANTED TO HAVE A GIRLS'
NIGHT OUT WITH MY FRIENDS.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.716
- BUT YOU DIDN'T LEAVE
WITH THEM?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.752
- NO,
I WAS BY MYSELF.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.722
BUT, UH--
OH, ACTUALLY, I REMEMBER,

07:34.755 --> 07:39.226
A TOWN CAR PULLED UP,
AND THE DRIVER HAD A GUN,

07:39.259 --> 07:42.496
AND HE MADE ME GET IN.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.065
- OKAY.
WHAT DID THIS DRIVER LOOK LIKE?

07:45.098 --> 07:48.001
- HE, UH...

07:48.035 --> 07:50.704
HE WAS BLACK.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.741
HE ATTACKED ME.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.644
- WAS--RIGHT THERE,
IN FRONT OF THE CLUB?

07:56.677 --> 07:59.212
'CAUSE YOU WERE FOUND
AROUND THE CORNER.

07:59.246 --> 08:05.118
- ALL I REMEMBER
WAS THE GUN.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.788
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT TYPE OF GUN?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.724
- IT WAS LIKE A--
A MACHINE GUN.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.060
- OKAY.
JESSIE, CAN YOU TELL US

08:13.093 --> 08:17.565
WHO YOU CALLED TONIGHT
FROM THE CLUB?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.899
- EXCUSE ME?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.101
- YOU CALLED ANOTHER NUMBER
THREE TIMES,

08:21.134 --> 08:25.906
ONCE
RIGHT BEFORE YOU LEFT.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.709
- JESSIE!
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.211
- TOMMY.
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY, PAL.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.681
- JESSIE. JESSIE, WHAT HAPPENED?
- JUST TAKE ME HOME, TOMMY.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.748

- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, COME ON.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.785
LET'S TAKE
A LITTLE WALK OUTSIDE, HUH?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.252

09:09.049 --> 09:11.852
COUPLE OF ASSAULT CONVICTIONS,
BAR FIGHTS.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.220
- SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE
RESPONDED

09:13.253 --> 09:15.723
TO THREE PRIOR DOMESTICS
AT JESSIE'S HOUSE.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.592
JESSIE NEVER
PRESSED CHARGES.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.960
- THE NUMBER SHE CALLED
THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR,

09:19.993 --> 09:21.194
WHO WAS IT?

09:21.228 --> 09:22.796
- WE TRACED IT
TO MICHAEL PROVO--

09:22.830 --> 09:26.166
YOUR D.A. PAL'S
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.835
- THE NEXT DAY,
FIN AND I DROVE OUT

09:27.868 --> 09:30.137
TO HIS P.I. OFFICE IN ISLIP.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.639
- YOU GUYS
DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THE TRIP.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.140
I COULD'VE COME BY.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.108
I'M IN AND OUT OF THE CITY
ALL THE TIME.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.844
HALF YOUR DEPARTMENT
OWES ME DRINKS.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.979
- HMM.
- SO YOU WERE ON THE JOB?

09:39.012 --> 09:43.851
- FORMER ATF. I'VE BEEN A P.I.
FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.220
SECURITY CONSULTANT,
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.756
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.858
- UH, DO YOU KNOW
A JESSIE STURGIS?

09:50.891 --> 09:53.026
- YES, I KNOW JESSIE.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.129
- SEE HER LAST NIGHT?

09:56.163 --> 09:57.998
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.634
- YOU WORK LAW ENFORCEMENT.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S A YES.

10:00.668 --> 10:04.672
- OKAY. OKAY.
UM, YES, SHE CALLED ME.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.774
SHE HAD TOO MANY DRINKS,
AND SHE ASKED ME TO PICK HER UP.

10:06.807 --> 10:11.645
- SO YOU TWO ARE...
FRIENDS?

10:11.679 --> 10:14.815
- LOOK, WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.
I'M MARRIED.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.950
I'M ALSO SEEING JESSIE.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.952
- WHAT WAS "IT"
LAST NIGHT?

10:18.986 --> 10:23.657
- LIKE I SAID,
SHE WAS DRUNK,

10:23.691 --> 10:26.059
MAD AT TOMMY.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.697
WHEN TOMMY DOES SOMETHING
TO HER, SHE DOES ME.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.299
HER LITTLE WAY
OF GETTING BACK.

10:32.332 --> 10:36.069
- OKAY, SO WAS THAT BEFORE
OR AFTER YOU SMACKED HER AROUND?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.771
- WHOA, WHAT--

10:37.805 --> 10:40.808
IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID?

10:40.841 --> 10:44.111
WAIT, THAT'S TOMMY'S M.O.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.813
- GO ON.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.180
- WE WERE IN THE CAR,
SHE'S ALL OVER ME,

10:47.214 --> 10:48.949
SHE GETS A TEXT FROM TOMMY,
SHE FREAKS OUT,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.751
SHE ASKED ME
TO TAKE HER BACK BY THE CLUB.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.185
IS SHE OKAY?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.954
- OH, SO SHE WAS FINE
WHEN YOU LEFT HER?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.824
- A LITTLE DRUNK,
MAYBE A LITTLE SCARED.

10:56.857 --> 11:00.961
LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU DNA,
PRINTS, EMAILS, VOICEMAIL,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.964
WHATEVER YOU NEED.
I GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.

11:03.997 --> 11:08.101
- HEY, PROVO.
I WAS A BAD GIRL.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.905
I HAD A FEW DRINKS.
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.774
- SO, JESSIE,
ASIDE FROM TOMMY,

11:13.807 --> 11:18.378
YOU WERE ALSO IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH MICHAEL PROVO?

11:18.411 --> 11:21.214
- HE'S SORT OF THERE
WHEN TOMMY ISN'T.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.484
- AND THE BLACK GUNMAN
IN THE TOWN CAR,

11:24.517 --> 11:27.120
HE'S NOT REAL,
IS HE?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.422
- NO, I'M SORRY.
I MADE HIM UP.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.826
I DIDN'T WANT TOMMY
TO KNOW.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.396
- TO KNOW WHAT? THAT YOU
CALLED MICHAEL THREE TIMES?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.465
THAT YOU GOT IN A CAR
WITH HIM?

11:38.498 --> 11:41.068
JESSIE...

11:41.101 --> 11:46.840
YOU WEREN'T RAPED,
WERE YOU?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.777
- I DIDN'T MAKE THAT PART UP,
I WAS RAPED

11:49.810 --> 11:53.046
BY MICHAEL PROVO.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.349
I BEGGED HIM TO STOP.

12:02.489 --> 12:06.026
- SHE SAID HE KEPT SMACKING HER
UNTIL SHE SHUT UP.

12:06.059 --> 12:10.764
- SO JESSIE DRUNK-DIALS PROVO,
SITUATION GOES SOUTH,

12:10.798 --> 12:13.200
AND HE RAPES HER?
- ONE MORE THING.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.337
SHE SAID IF TOMMY FOUND OUT,
HE'D KILL HER.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.974
- AND THEN SHE WINDS UP
SHOOTING HIM.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.278
- LET'S GO BACK
TO LABOR DAY WEEKEND,

12:25.312 --> 12:26.780
THE NIGHT OF THE RAPE.

12:26.814 --> 12:27.480
JESSIE DID NOT WANT
TOMMY BANDOLCE

12:27.514 --> 12:28.949
TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.283
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT HE DID FIND OUT,

12:30.317 --> 12:31.885
AND HE'S THE ONE
WHO ASSAULTED HER?

12:31.919 --> 12:34.387
- THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT,
BUT TOMMY HAD AN ALIBI.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.791
- TURNED OUT HE SPENT LABOR DAY
WEEKEND IN BELLPORT,

12:37.825 --> 12:40.460
ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS
OF A CLIENT'S WIFE.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.495
- HUH.
THE CLIENT'S WIFE CONFIRMED?

12:42.529 --> 12:46.099
- ALONG WITH TOMMY'S E-ZPASS
AND GPS RECORDS.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.436
- OKAY, SO BANDOLCE
DIDN'T RAPE HER...FOR NOW,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.071
BUT JESSIE STILL
COULD HAVE CRIED RAPE

12:51.104 --> 12:53.173
TO COVER UP
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVO.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.408
- AND BEAT HERSELF UP
TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.410
LOOK, JESSIE MAY HAVE LIED
FROM THE START,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.346
BUT ONCE
SHE ACCUSED PROVO,

12:59.379 --> 13:01.849
SHE WAS CONSISTENT
IN ALL OF HER DETAILS.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.851
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TALKED ME
INTO PRESSING CHARGES.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.485
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
ARRESTED HIM YET?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.521
- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THERE AREN'T ANY SURPRISES.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.291
- AM I ON TRIAL,
OR IS HE?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.460
OKAY.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.263
I'LL BE BACK,
SWEETIE.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.331
I'VE BEEN SOBER
SEVEN MONTHS NOW,

13:18.365 --> 13:20.133
BUT TOMMY AND I HAD A FIGHT
THAT NIGHT,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.601
AND I HAD
A LITTLE SLIP.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.036
- WHEN YOU WERE OUT
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS?

13:23.070 --> 13:26.539
- YES, BUT I CAN NEVER
JUST HAVE ONE DRINK.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.608
I'VE GOT
MONSTER MOMENTUM.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.577
WHEN I'M PICKING UP,
I'M PICKING UP.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.412
- SO YOU CALLED MICHAEL.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.514
AND HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN IN THE PICTURE?

13:34.547 --> 13:38.185
- OH, GOSH,
SINCE THE SPRING.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.487
THE LAST TIME
TOMMY AND I BROKE UP.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.422
MICHAEL'S HIS FRIEND.
HE CAME BY TO SAY

13:42.455 --> 13:46.259
HE WAS CHECKING IN ON ME,
AND THEN HE KEPT COMING BY.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.529
- SO HAS MICHAEL EVER
GOTTEN ROUGH WITH YOU BEFORE?

13:49.562 --> 13:54.367
- NO, BUT, UH,
IT WAS MY FAULT HE DID.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.104
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM
TO STOP.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.940
- JESSIE...

13:59.973 --> 14:05.212
YOU CAN SAY NO...
ANYTIME.

14:05.245 --> 14:09.249
- SO...DID YOU?

14:09.282 --> 14:13.453
- WHEN WE WERE GOING AT IT
IN HIS CAR, HE GETS A CALL...

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
FROM HIS WIFE.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.058
- AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS MARRIED.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.559
- NOT TILL I HEAR KIDS CRYING
IN THE BACKGROUND,

14:19.592 --> 14:24.564
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"BABE, BRING ME BABY ASPIRIN."

14:24.597 --> 14:27.267
I WAS LIKE,
"TAKE ME HOME."

14:27.300 --> 14:29.602
- AND HE GOT MAD.

14:29.636 --> 14:34.341
- HE SAID, "BITCH,
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO."

14:34.374 --> 14:36.043
AND THEN,
AFTER HE'S DONE WITH ME,

14:36.076 --> 14:38.445
HE DROPS ME
ON THE STREET,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.181
REMINDS ME HE'S A COP,
AND HE SAYS,

14:41.214 --> 14:46.386
"YOU TELL ANYONE,
YOU'LL REGRET IT."

14:48.989 --> 14:51.458
- PROVO'S NOT A COP.
HE WAS AN ANALYST

14:51.491 --> 14:54.061
FOR ALCOHOL, TOBACCO,
AND FIREARMS SIX YEARS AGO.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.397
- RIGHT, SO EITHER HE'S LYING
TO HER, OR SHE'S LYING TO US.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.932
- WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?
DOES HE HAVE A RECORD?

14:58.966 --> 15:01.634
- NOTHING IN THE NYPD DATABASE,
BUT LOOK AT THIS--

15:01.668 --> 15:04.404
FOUR YEARS AGO,
HE WAS QUESTIONED

15:04.437 --> 15:06.706
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT IN ISLIP--
CONSUELO DIAZ.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.241
- THEY MAKE IT STICK?

15:08.275 --> 15:11.311
- CHARGES WERE NEVER FILED,

15:11.344 --> 15:14.181
BUT THE VICTIM
WAS DEPORTED TO BELIZE...

15:14.214 --> 15:19.086
AFTER IMMIGRATION GOT A TIP
FROM "FORMER FEDERAL AGENT."

15:19.119 --> 15:23.290
- PROVO DROPPED A DIME ON HER.
HE PLAYS ROUGH.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.292
- MR. PROVO,
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.461
JESSIE WON'T MOVE
OFF HER ACCUSATION.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.163
- POOR GIRL'S
GOT STOCKHOLM SYNDROME.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.498
TOMMY'S ABUSED HER
FOR SO LONG,

15:31.531 --> 15:32.599
SHE'S TERRIFIED
OF TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.567
- MAYBE,
BUT HE DIDN'T ASSAULT HER.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.470
HE'S GOT AN ALIBI.
YOU DON'T.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.306
- [sighs]

15:39.339 --> 15:42.475
LOOK, HERE'S THE TRUTH.
JESSIE WAS BOMBED.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.512
SHE'S ALL OVER ME,
AND THEN...

15:45.545 --> 15:48.181
MY WIFE CALLS,
WHICH FREAKED HER OUT.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.483
- YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
TOMMY DIDN'T DO IT.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.419
SOMEBODY
DID A NUMBER ON HER.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.655
- [sighs] LOOK,
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.025
SHE WAS SO MAD AT ME,
SHE JUMPED RIGHT OUT OF MY CAR.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.360
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY
AFTER THAT.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.563
- WHY IS SHE INSISTING
THAT IT WAS YOU?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.165
- I'M HERE OF MY OWN VOLITION,
DETECTIVE.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.566
I KNOW
YOU GOT A JOB TO DO,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.335
BUT YOU'RE HANGING YOUR HAT
ON THE WRONG RACK.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.670
- OKAY, LET'S TRY ANOTHER RACK.
CONSUELO DIAZ.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.205
YOU WERE QUESTIONED
ABOUT RAPING HER.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.007
- THOSE CHARGES
WERE NEVER FILED.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.475
- THEN WHY'D SHE ACCUSE YOU?

16:15.508 --> 16:16.709
- [sighs]
SHE WAS THE FIANCEE

16:16.743 --> 16:18.611
OF A FRIEND OF MINE
FIGHTING DEPORTATION.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.313
SHE THOUGHT SHE'D GET SYMPATHY
BY CRYING RAPE,

16:20.347 --> 16:21.514
THEN SHE THOUGHT BETTER.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.150
- AFTER YOU HAD HER
SENT BACK TO BELIZE?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.052
- WHAT?
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.521
- COUNSELOR DAVID ELIAS
FOR MR. PROVO.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.423
- HE DIDN'T ASK
FOR A LAWYER.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.025
- ACTUALLY, DETECTIVE,
I'M WITH THE SUFFOLK COUNTY

16:32.059 --> 16:33.626
D.A.'S OFFICE.
- DAVID, EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.628
- WE NEED MR. PROVO'S HELP
WITH A CASE.

16:35.662 --> 16:40.033
- [chuckles] I'M SORRY, GUYS.
YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.603
- SORRY TO DRAG YOU IN
ON THIS.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.771
D.A. JUST HAS
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.240
- DID NOT
SEE THAT COMING.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.177
- AND THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW
THIS GUY HAD JUICE.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.712
- OKAY, PROVO'S GOT HOOKS.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.614
- FIRST, WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT
JUST BE A SOURCE FOR THE D.A.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.782
WORKING OFF A CHARGE.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.417
- BUT THEN
WE STARTED LOOKING

16:57.450 --> 16:59.252
AT THE TRIALS
WHERE PROVO TESTIFIED.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.054
WE BACKTRACKED
TO THE CASE FILES,

17:01.088 --> 17:03.723
AND WE FOUND
HIS ANONYMOUS C.I. NUMBER.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.559
- TURNS OUT HE'S BEEN A RAT
SINCE 2008.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.395
- 2008?

17:08.428 --> 17:11.498
THAT'S A YEAR
BEFORE THE CONSUELO DIAZ RAPE.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.632
- MAYBE THAT'S
WHY PAM JAMES

17:12.665 --> 17:14.567
NEVER PRESSED CHARGES
ON THAT CASE.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.304
- IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A D.A.
TO PROTECT HER ASSET.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.705
[cell phone chimes]
- [chuckles]

17:18.738 --> 17:20.273
SHE'S STILL
PROTECTING HIM.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.574
SHE'S ARRAIGNING JESSIE
IN TWO HOURS.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.644
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

17:24.677 --> 17:26.779
- MR. BARBA, I AM DUE IN COURT
IN THREE MINUTES.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.581
WHERE'S THAT CASE FILE?
- I'VE HIT A COUPLE

17:28.615 --> 17:30.350
OF RED FLAGS.
IT TURNS OUT MICHAEL PROVO

17:30.383 --> 17:32.185
WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE
FOUR YEARS AGO.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.620
- IT'S NOT AN ISSUE.
CHARGES WERE NEVER FILED.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.288
- YOU MEAN
YOU NEVER FILED THEM.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.257
YOU WERE THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY ON THAT CASE.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.458
- THIS ISN'T THE CITY.
WE DON'T DRAG

17:38.491 --> 17:40.093
THE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
THROUGH THE MUD.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.694
- ESPECIALLY NOT
IF HE'S YOUR C.I.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.597
- SAVE YOURSELF SOME GRIEF.
DROP YOUR CHARGES AGAINST PROVO.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.467
JESSIE STURGIS IS AN UNSTABLE
WITNESS AND A MURDERER.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.503
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT HER
ON THE STAND.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.507
- THE PEOPLE VERSUS
JESSICA STURGIS.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.875
THE CHARGE
IS MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.577
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.646
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.
I'M INNOCENT.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.880
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.882
- YOUR HONOR,
WE ASK THAT BAIL BE DENIED.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.251
MS. STURGIS REPRESENTS
A FLIGHT RISK.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.518
SHE'S FACING
A MURDER CHARGE.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.886
- MS. STURGIS
WORKS AT A LOCAL PHARMACY

18:06.919 --> 18:08.155
AND HAS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.656
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.424
- EVEN SO, I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
BAIL IS SET
AT $200,000.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.428
- WHAT?
I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.863
NONE OF THIS IS TRUE.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.131
WHAT ABOUT MATTHEW, MY SON?
- MA'AM, CALM DOWN.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.532
- WHO'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM?

18:19.566 --> 18:20.800
- THE COURT WILL BE IN TOUCH
WITH SOCIAL SERVICES.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.469
- DETECTIVE BENSON,
PLEASE TELL HIM!

18:22.502 --> 18:24.304
TELL HIM I DIDN'T DO IT!

18:24.337 --> 18:25.872
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO THIS!
TELL HIM!

18:25.905 --> 18:29.509
- THAT'S ENOUGH, MS. STURGIS.
- PLEASE TELL HIM!

18:29.542 --> 18:32.645
- THINGS SEEM TO BE MOVING
AWFULLY FAST OUT HERE.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.347
- WE'RE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S
COURTHOUSE,

18:34.381 --> 18:36.649
AND IT'S NOT OUR CASE.
SHE'S THEIR DEFENDANT.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.887
- I KNOW,
BUT SHE'S ALSO OUR VICTIM.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.198
- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.200
THEY'RE PUTTING MATTHEW
INTO FOSTER CARE?

18:53.233 --> 18:54.634
I DIDN'T KILL TOMMY!

18:54.667 --> 18:57.904
HE JUST WANTED TO TALK.
HE WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT THERE.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.639
- JESSIE, THE MURDER CHARGE
IS IN THE HANDS

18:59.672 --> 19:00.940
OF THE SUFFOLK COUNTY D.A.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.642
WE CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.944
- WHAT?
- UNLESS YOU THINK

19:04.977 --> 19:08.748
THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SOME BEARING
ON YOUR RAPE CASE.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.184
YOU SAID THAT TOMMY
WAS ANGRY ABOUT IT.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.486
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
HE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU?

19:13.520 --> 19:14.621
- MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.956
HE JUST CALLED ME TWICE,
UPSET,

19:16.989 --> 19:19.292
SAID HE HAD TO SEE ME.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.528
HE HAD ME TO MEET HIM
AT THIS HOUSE AT 8:00.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.796
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU GOT THERE?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.533
- I RANG THE BELL,
BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

19:26.566 --> 19:30.470
THE DOOR WASN'T LOCKED,
SO I WALKED IN.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.973
I SEE HIM LYING THERE
ON THE FLOOR.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.276
HE'D BEEN SHOT
IN THE CHEST,

19:36.309 --> 19:38.978
AND I TRIED
TO STOP THE BLOOD.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.515
WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE
WITH 911, THE POLICE COME.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.217
- HOLD ON.
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

19:44.251 --> 19:46.286
- I HADN'T EVEN GIVEN THEM
THE ADDRESS YET,

19:46.319 --> 19:52.225
AND COP CARS SHOWED UP,
SIRENS GOING.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.327
- OKAY,
AND WHAT TIME WAS THIS?

19:54.361 --> 19:56.363
- RIGHT AT 8:00.
THEY WALK IN, THEY SEE ME,

19:56.396 --> 19:59.599
TOMMY DEAD,
THE GUN ON THE FLOOR.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.901
WASN'T MY GUN.
I'VE NEVER EVEN TOUCHED A GUN,

20:01.934 --> 20:07.240
BUT THEY ARRESTED ME.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.943
- JESSIE...
HAD YOU BEEN DRINKING?

20:10.977 --> 20:14.013
- I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
SINCE THE NIGHT I WAS RAPED.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.316
I SWEAR.

20:19.919 --> 20:24.357
PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.660
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

20:30.363 --> 20:34.934
I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO MY SON.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.969
PLEASE.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.975
- WE NEED TO CHECK THE TIMELINE
ON HER 911 CALL.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.378
- LIV, IF YOU WERE A COP
ON THAT SCENE,

20:45.412 --> 20:46.613
YOU WOULD HAVE
ARRESTED HER TOO.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.748
- LOOK, I GET IT,
IT LOOKS BAD,

20:48.781 --> 20:52.619
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, I BELIEVE
THAT SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.920
I WANT TO SEE
THAT CASE FILE.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.022
- I GOT A COUSIN
ON THE JOB OUT HERE.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.790
I'LL SEE
IF I CAN PULL A FAVOR.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.393
- DETECTIVES,
FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.363
YOU SAVED ME A TRIP TO THE CITY.
- WHAT'S THIS?

21:03.396 --> 21:05.498
- A SUBPOENA TO APPEAR
BEFORE A GRAND JURY

21:05.532 --> 21:06.699
IN JESSIE'S MURDER CASE.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.736
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.042
- DETECTIVE, DIDN'T
JESSIE STURGIS INITIALLY CLAIM

21:16.075 --> 21:17.910
TO HAVE BEEN RAPED
AT MACHINE GUN POINT

21:17.944 --> 21:19.879
BY A STRANGER
IN A TOWN CAR?

21:19.912 --> 21:21.914
- YES, BUT VICTIMS FREQUENTLY--
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.852
DID SHE LIE?
- YES.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.420
- AND DID SHE SAY SHE LIED
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT

21:27.454 --> 21:29.522
HER BOYFRIEND, MR. BANDOLCE,
TO KNOW THE TRUTH--

21:29.556 --> 21:30.890
THAT SHE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.625
- ACTUALLY,
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS--

21:32.659 --> 21:33.926
- YES OR NO,
WAS SHE TRYING TO HIDE

21:33.960 --> 21:35.695
HER AFFAIR
FROM HER BOYFRIEND?

21:35.728 --> 21:36.963
- YES.
- WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

21:36.996 --> 21:38.998
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
AS ACRIMONIOUS?

21:39.031 --> 21:42.001
- I WOULD SAY
THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.970
- AND YET, TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE,
AFTER HE FOUND OUT

21:44.003 --> 21:46.973
ABOUT THE AFFAIR,
DID HE HARM HER IN ANY WAY?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.975
- NO.
- IN FACT, DID MR. BANDOLCE

21:49.008 --> 21:51.978
PICK HER UP FROM THE HOSPITAL
ON THE NIGHT OF THE ALLEGED RAPE

21:52.011 --> 21:53.946
AND TAKE HER HOME?
- YES, BUT--

21:53.980 --> 21:58.985
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.687
- HOW WAS
THE GRAND JURY?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.790
- THEY'LL INDICT HER BY LUNCH.
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.091
- MY COUSIN CAME THROUGH.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.893
WE GOT
THE BANDOLCE MURDER CASE FILE.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.961
- ANYTHING
THAT HELPS JESSIE?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.863
- WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE TIMELINE.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.533
- THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER,
TOMMY BANDOLCE CALLS JESSIE

22:13.566 --> 22:16.503
ONCE AT 7:06,
ONCE AT 7:40.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.371
SHE SAID HE BEGGED HER
TO MEET HER BY 8:00

22:18.405 --> 22:20.373
AT A HOUSE
THAT WAS 15 MINUTES AWAY.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.908
- WHEN SHE CALLED BACK
AT 7:50

22:21.941 --> 22:24.777
TO SAY SHE WAS FIVE MINUTES
AWAY, HE DIDN'T PICK UP.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.614
- WHAT DOESN'T FOLLOW, AT 7:55,
A NEIGHBOR,

22:27.647 --> 22:29.682
LARRY BANKS,
CALLS IN

22:29.716 --> 22:31.918
A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE
AT THAT HOUSE.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.587
- 911.
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

22:34.621 --> 22:36.856
- I'M HEARING THIS COUPLE
FIGHTING, SHE'S SCREAMING.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.392
52 CORMACK COURT,
BABYLON.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.027
- EVEN IF
JESSIE WAS THERE,

22:41.060 --> 22:42.829
I MEAN, THEY GOT INTO
THAT ARGUMENT AWFULLY FAST.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.432
- YEAH, AND THEN,
THREE MINUTES LATER,

22:45.465 --> 22:47.567
A WOMAN DRIVING BY
CALLS.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.168
- 911.
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.670
- HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.439
- YES, MA'AM.
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.774
- I'M DRIVING DOWN CORMACK,
AND I JUST HEARD GUNSHOTS.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.075
- WHO WAS THAT?

22:56.108 --> 22:57.910
- THAT CAME
FROM A NO-NAME PHONE.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.913
SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE ARE TRYING
TO TRACK HER DOWN NOW.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.016
- THEN AT 8:02, JESSIE CALLS
TO SAY SHE FOUND TOMMY.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.885
BY THEN,
THE POLICE HAVE ARRIVED.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.187
THEY SEE HER NEXT TO THE BODY,
THE GUN.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.756
I MEAN,
IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT,

23:09.789 --> 23:10.990
BUT I CAN SEE
WHY THEY CHARGED HER.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.759
- THEY FIND PRINTS ON THE GUN?
- NO.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.761
AND NO RESIDUE
ON JESSIE'S HANDS.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.895
- WERE THEY ABLE
TO TRACE IT?

23:15.928 --> 23:18.965
- YEAH,
REGISTERED TO OWNER...

23:18.998 --> 23:22.001
GORROMINI & SONS
ON FIFTH AVENUE.

23:22.034 --> 23:27.006
IT'S "QUALITY SELLERS
OF FINE CLOTHES AND FIREARMS."

23:27.039 --> 23:28.575
AND WHEN SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE
SPOKE TO HIM,

23:28.608 --> 23:31.010
HE CLAIMED
JESSIE STOLE IT FROM HIM.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.045
- BUT HE DIDN'T
REPORT THE GUN STOLEN

23:33.079 --> 23:35.482
UNTIL THE COPS TALKED TO HIM?
- HMM.

23:35.515 --> 23:39.952
- I SAY
WE FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

23:39.986 --> 23:43.089
- MY FAMILY HAS BEEN
CLOTHIERS AND ARMORERS

23:43.122 --> 23:44.824
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.959
WE HAVE A LICENSE
FOR EVERY RIFLE IN THE STORE.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.495
- THE HANDGUN
USED IN THE MURDER

23:48.528 --> 23:50.897
WAS REGISTERED TO YOU
PERSONALLY, MR. GORROMINI.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.932
- YES, I KNOW.
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.201
I TOLD THE OTHER POLICE
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.770
- TELL US AGAIN.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.071
- LAST JUNE,
SHE CAME INTO THE STORE.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.907
I NOTICED HER
IMMEDIATELY.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.077
SHE HAD A CERTAIN...
SOMETHING.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.046
- SHE SAY
WHY SHE NEEDED A GUN?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.648
- YES, SHE SAID
HER PHARMACY WAS ROBBED,

24:08.681 --> 24:10.517
SHE NEEDED PROTECTION.
I TOLD THAT HER

24:10.550 --> 24:13.820
THAT WE DIDN'T SELL HANDGUNS,
AND NEVER WITHOUT A LICENSE.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.855
- SO YOU JUST
GAVE HER ONE?

24:15.888 --> 24:19.058
- I BELIEVE SHE TOOK THE GUN
FROM MY BEDROOM CLOSET.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.061
THAT NIGHT, I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF SLEEPING WITH HER.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.931
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
REPORT IT STOLEN?

24:24.964 --> 24:28.701
- I DIDN'T NOTICE.

24:28.735 --> 24:31.137
THE--
THE SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE

24:31.170 --> 24:34.741
ASSURED ME THAT
THIS WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM,

24:34.774 --> 24:36.909
SINCE I WAS COOPERATING
WITH THEIR CASE.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.978
- YOU'RE DEALING WITH MANHATTAN
NOW, CHIEF,

24:39.011 --> 24:41.180
SO YOU'RE COMING
WITH US.

24:41.213 --> 24:44.016
- I'M NOT SURE WHY WE'RE HERE.
- YOU'RE NOT?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.018
YOUR CLIENT EITHER
KNOWINGLY PROVIDED A WEAPON

24:46.052 --> 24:48.555
THAT WAS USED IN A MURDER, OR
HE FAILED TO REPORT IT STOLEN.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.990
EITHER WAY,
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.059
- NOT IF YOU GIVE HIM
QUEEN FOR A DAY.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.294
- SOLD.
WE'LL THROW IN A TIARA,

24:55.327 --> 24:57.163
AS LONG AS HE
TELLS US EVERYTHING,

24:57.196 --> 24:59.932
RIGHT NOW, NO HOLDING BACK.
WE WON'T USE IT AGAINST HIM.

24:59.966 --> 25:04.136
YOU'VE LIED TWICE.
LAST CHANCE.

25:07.139 --> 25:10.977
- SAME QUESTION,
HOW DID JESSIE GET THE GUN?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.212
- I'M NOT SURE.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.947
- SO SHE WAS NEVER
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

25:14.981 --> 25:17.083
YOU NEVER SLEPT WITH HER?
- NO.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.587
I NEVER EVEN MET HER.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.722
FRIEND ASKED TO BORROW THE GUN
ON HER BEHALF.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.225
- WHAT FRIEND?
- HIS NAME IS MICHAEL PROVO.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.596
- AND WHEN WAS THIS?
- ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.731
HE SAID
IT WAS A PERSONAL FAVOR.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.902
- THAT'S A BIG FAVOR.
YOU'D RISK YOUR LICENSE FOR HIM?

25:35.935 --> 25:39.538
- THIS QUEEN FOR A DAY
COVERS EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

25:40.707 --> 25:44.010
- [whispering]
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

25:47.346 --> 25:50.817
- PROVO SAVED MY LICENSE
TEN YEARS AGO.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.953
HE TIPPED ME OFF
ABOUT AN ATF STING.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.624
HE CALLED THE OTHER NIGHT, SAID
THE GUN WAS USED IN A CRIME,

25:57.657 --> 26:00.993
SAID HE'D SMOOTH IT OVER
WITH THE D.A.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.062
- AND THE STORY
ABOUT JESSICA STEALING THE GUN?

26:03.095 --> 26:06.766
- THAT CAME FROM PROVO.
EVERY WORD.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.970
- PROVO GOT GORROMINI
TO LIE.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.739
FIND OUT IF HE COERCED
ANY OTHER WITNESSES.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.907
- I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU,
COUNSELOR, AS USUAL.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.043
LARRY BANKS,
WHO MADE THE FIRST 911 CALL

26:17.076 --> 26:18.277
ABOUT A DOMESTIC DISPUTE.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.946
- ANY SUFFOLK COUNTY
POLICE CONTACTS?

26:19.979 --> 26:21.313
- TWO DUIs,
BOTH OF WHICH WERE DROPPED.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.949
- OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.917
WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN
WHO CALLED IN THE GUNSHOTS?

26:24.951 --> 26:26.318
- WELL, THE SUFFOLK COUNTY
POLICE CLAIMS

26:26.352 --> 26:28.020
THAT THEY'RE STILL TRYING
TO TRACE THE CELL PHONE.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.990
BUT OUR WORKING THEORY
IS THAT PROVO HELD A GUN

26:31.023 --> 26:33.660
TO TOMMY'S HEAD,
FORCED HIM TO CALL JESSIE.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.328
- ONCE SHE'S ON HER WAY,
PROVO TRIGGERS THE 911 CALLS,

26:36.362 --> 26:38.197
AND THE POLICE ARRIVE
JUST AFTER JESSIE DOES.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.132
- SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME
FOR A SIT-DOWN

26:40.166 --> 26:41.801
WITH THE SUFFOLK COUNTY D.A.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.736
- OPEN OUR KIMONO?
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.004
THE GUN
CAME FROM MANHATTAN.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.674
WE'RE CLOSING IN
ON A CONSPIRACY.

26:47.707 --> 26:51.978
THIS IS OUR CASE NOW.

26:52.011 --> 26:55.347
- MICHAEL PROVO, NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU PRIVATELY.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.384
- WE'RE ABOUT TO HIT THE ROAD.
GO GET THE DOG.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.319
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
WE HAVE A WARRANT

27:00.352 --> 27:02.221
FOR YOUR ARREST
IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.123
- WHAT FOR?
- BESIDES A RAPE CHARGE,

27:04.156 --> 27:06.759
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR CONSPIRACY AND MURDER.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.160
- YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.363
I SAID GET INSIDE!
CALL PAM JAMES, NOW.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.899
YOU REALLY
HAVE TO DO THAT?

27:12.932 --> 27:14.667
- YOU STILL THINK
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.770
GET IN THE CAR.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.014
[vacuum running]

27:28.047 --> 27:31.050
- MS. JAMES,
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TOWN?

27:31.083 --> 27:33.219
- I WAS HEADING
TO THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDRAISER

27:33.252 --> 27:37.123
WHEN THAT YOUR SVU MINIONS
ARRESTED MR. PROVO IN ISLIP.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.991
- YEAH, THEY SAID TRAFFIC
WAS TERRIBLE COMING BACK.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.459
- I'M MORE
THAN A LITTLE SURPRISED

27:40.492 --> 27:42.194
I DIDN'T GET A HEADS-UP
FROM YOUR OFFICE.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.830
- [chuckles] YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY FORTHCOMING

27:43.863 --> 27:45.197
WHEN YOU CAME
TO ASK ABOUT JESSIE STURGIS.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.365
- AND YOU'RE
PAYING ME BACK

27:46.398 --> 27:48.735
BY TRYING TO BLOW A HOLE
IN MY MURDER CASE.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.703
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT PAYBACK,
AND IT DOESN'T STOP

27:50.737 --> 27:52.805
WITH MICHAEL PROVO
FRAMING JESSIE FOR MURDER.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.207
- MICHAEL PROVO
DID NOT FRAME JESSIE.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.977
- YOU CAN'T ADMIT THAT,
RIGHT?

27:58.010 --> 28:01.180
IF PROVO FRAMED JESSIE,
HE COULD'VE FRAMED ANYONE,

28:01.213 --> 28:02.715
WHICH MEANS
YOU'D HAVE TO REOPEN

28:02.749 --> 28:04.784
EVERY CASE
HE WAS EVER INVOLVED WITH.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.352
YOUR WHOLE OFFICE
COULD BE VULNERABLE HERE.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.221
THIS GUY'S GOT YOU
JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS, PAM.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.490
DROPPING RAPE CHARGES,
DUIs--

28:11.523 --> 28:13.425
- YOU ATTACK
THE INTEGRITY OF MY OFFICE,

28:13.459 --> 28:16.062
YOU'RE IN FOR THE FIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.898
- I NEVER MIND
A LITTLE BLOOD ON THE CANVAS.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.467
YOU GOT AN EVENT TO GET TO?
ENJOY.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.771
I GOT A CASE TO PREPARE.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.242
- SO YOU CAN PROVE IT?

28:30.276 --> 28:32.144
THAT MICHAEL KILLED TOMMY
AND SET THIS WHOLE THING UP?

28:32.178 --> 28:34.480
- OUR D.A.'S ADDING
CONSPIRACY AND MURDER

28:34.513 --> 28:35.782
TO PROVO'S RAPE CHARGE.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.217
- OH, THANK GOD.
CAN I GO HOME TONIGHT?

28:38.250 --> 28:39.752
MY BOY'S
IN FOSTER CARE.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.221
- SEE, JESSIE,
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS,

28:42.254 --> 28:47.026
IS THAT THE SUFFOLK COUNTY D.A.
WON'T DROP THE CHARGES.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.261
- WHY? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
MICHAEL DID IT.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.363
- WE BELIEVE YOU WERE FRAMED.
THEY THINK YOU DID IT.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.133
IT'S TWO SEPARATE COUNTIES,
TWO SEPARATE TRIALS.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.534
- THIS IS INSANE.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.269
HE RAPED ME, KILLED TOMMY,
PUT ME IN HERE.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.239
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU CAN'T GET ME OUT?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.540
WHAT IF THEY CONVICT ME?

29:01.573 --> 29:03.810
- WE'RE BUILDING
YOUR CASE.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.544
WE'RE WORKING
WITH YOUR DEFENSE TEAM.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.114
THE D.A. WILL NOT GIVE UP.
I JUST--

29:08.147 --> 29:11.083
WE JUST NEED YOU TO HANG IN
THERE A LITTLE LONGER, OKAY?

29:11.117 --> 29:13.552
- "JUST HANG IN THERE"?

29:13.585 --> 29:16.555
GET OUT.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.958
LEAVE.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.895
GET OUT!

29:22.929 --> 29:25.531
- GUARD.
[buzzer]

29:30.136 --> 29:33.139
- [sobbing]

29:38.544 --> 29:40.446
- YOUR HONOR, THE GRAND JURY
INDICTED MICHAEL PROVO

29:40.479 --> 29:43.049
FOR RAPE, MURDER,
AND CONSPIRACY.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.383
WE WOULD LIKE TO CONSOLIDATE
THESE CHARGES

29:44.416 --> 29:46.152
TO PROCEED TO TRIAL
TOGETHER.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.154
- AT THE VERY LEAST,
THE CHARGES SHOULD BE SEPARATE.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.957
THERE'S NO LINK BETWEEN THEM.
- THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY LINKED.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.224
WE INTEND TO PROVE
THAT THE DEFENDANT

29:52.258 --> 29:53.425
FRAMED JESSIE STURGIS
FOR MURDER

29:53.459 --> 29:55.461
BECAUSE SHE ACCUSED HIM
OF RAPE.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.462
- MR. BARBA
HAS OVERSTEPPED--

29:56.495 --> 29:59.131
- IT'S A COMPLICATED CASE,

29:59.165 --> 30:01.600
BUT I DO SEE A BASIS
FOR CONSOLIDATING.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.536
DEFENSE MOTION DENIED.
[bangs gavel]

30:04.570 --> 30:05.972
- YOUR HONOR?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.240
- MS. JAMES.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.276
- I KNOW IT'S UNUSUAL, BUT
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COURT.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.277
- OBJECTION.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.278
THE SUFFOLK COUNTY D.A.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.080
IS NOT A PARTY IN THIS CASE.

30:14.113 --> 30:17.249
- THIS MATTER HAS BEARING ON
A CASE SET FOR TRIAL IN ISLIP.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.218
I WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE
OF THAT CONFLICT.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.353
- APPROACH.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.524
WHAT DO YOU HAVE,
MS. JAMES?

30:25.557 --> 30:29.161
- THE ALLEGED VICTIM
IN THIS TRIAL, JESSIE STURGIS,

30:29.195 --> 30:30.496
IS UNDER INDICTMENT
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY

30:30.529 --> 30:32.064
FOR THE SAME MURDER.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.000
WE GO TO TRIAL
ON MONDAY.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.535
I'M ASKING YOU
TO DISMISS THE CHARGES HERE.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.604
- YOUR HONOR, THE LAW CLEARLY
ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS

30:38.637 --> 30:40.339
TO BE TRIED
IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

30:40.372 --> 30:42.508
FOR THE SAME CRIME.
- THANK YOU, MR. BARBA.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.945
I'M AWARE
OF WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.346
AND HE'S RIGHT.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.016
- THEN WE ASK
THAT YOU STAY YOUR CASE

30:50.049 --> 30:51.050
UNTIL OUR TRIAL
IS OVER.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.551
- AND YOUR JURY'S VERDICT

30:52.584 --> 30:54.220
DICTATES
THE COURSE OF OUR TRIAL.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.488
- MS. JAMES,
ALL DUE RESPECT,

30:56.522 --> 30:57.990
I DON'T RUN
THE MANHATTAN COURTROOM

30:58.024 --> 30:59.558
ON SUFFOLK TIME.

30:59.591 --> 31:04.030
YOU TRY YOUR CASE,
MR. BARBA TRIES HIS.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.364
- WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.632
- ARE WE?
- MM-HMM.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.500
- TWO TRIALS
AT THE SAME TIME?

31:08.534 --> 31:10.636
WHAT IF SUFFOLK COUNTY
GOES TO JURY BEFORE US?

31:10.669 --> 31:12.371
- LEAVE THAT FOR OUR ESTEEMED
APPELLATE COURT.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.240
- WHILE JESSIE
ROTS IN HER JAIL CELL

31:14.273 --> 31:17.043
AND PROVO'S OUT ON BAIL.
- DETECTIVE...

31:17.076 --> 31:18.677
YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THIS FASTER?

31:18.710 --> 31:22.414
HELP YOURSELF.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.186
- WE ARE GONNA PROVE,
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,

31:27.219 --> 31:33.059
THAT MS. STURGIS CHEATED
ON HER BOYFRIEND, MR. BANDOLCE.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.128
SHE LIED TO HIM
ABOUT IT,

31:36.162 --> 31:40.199
AND WHEN HE
CONFRONTED HER,

31:40.232 --> 31:42.969
SHE SHOT HIM.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.603
- FORGET
WHAT YOU MAY HAVE READ

31:44.636 --> 31:47.273
OR HEARD ABOUT THE SUFFOLK
COUNTY D.A.'S CASE.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.708
THIS TRIAL IS
ABOUT INJUSTICE COMPOUNDED.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.045
MICHAEL PROVO BRUTALLY RAPED
JESSIE STURGIS,

31:53.079 --> 31:54.680
AND WHEN SHE DARED
TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT,

31:54.713 --> 31:59.485
HE CONSPIRED TO FRAME HER
FOR MURDER.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.488
- WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE,
MR. PROVO.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.990
YOU KNOW THE JURY'S
BEEN INFORMED

32:04.023 --> 32:06.058
THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY
ON TRIAL IN MANHATTAN

32:06.092 --> 32:07.593
FOR THE MURDER
OF MR. BANDOLCE?

32:07.626 --> 32:08.727
- YES,
THAT'S CORRECT.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.729
- DID YOU MURDER
MR. BANDOLCE?

32:10.762 --> 32:13.265
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.401
- BUT YOU WERE INVOLVED
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND,

32:15.434 --> 32:17.403
THE DEFENDANT,
JESSIE STURGIS?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.439
- YES. SHE AND TOMMY WERE...
ROCKY,

32:20.472 --> 32:22.241
I WAS
HER PORT IN THE STORM.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.243
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THE TWO OF YOU TALKED?

32:24.276 --> 32:28.480
- A WEEK
BEFORE THE MURDER.

32:28.514 --> 32:32.318
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO TEACH TOMMY A LESSON.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.354
AND SHE ASKED ME
FOR A GUN.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.992
- MS. STURGIS,
AFTER MICHAEL PROVO RAPED YOU,

32:40.026 --> 32:42.161
WHAT DID HE SAY?

32:42.194 --> 32:44.230
- HE SAID HE WAS A COP,
AND IF I TOLD ANYONE,

32:44.263 --> 32:45.497
I'D REGRET IT.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.366
- AND DID THAT CONCERN YOU?
- YES.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.436
HE'D ALWAYS BRAG TO ME ABOUT
ALL THE CONNECTIONS HE HAD.

32:50.469 --> 32:55.507
HE SAID HE COULD SET UP
ANYONE, ANYTIME.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.277
- SO JESSIE'S DOING FINE?
SHE'LL BE OKAY DURING CROSS?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.312
- I HOPE SO.
YESTERDAY, IN ISLIP,

33:00.346 --> 33:02.414
PROVO CHARMED HIS JURY.

33:02.448 --> 33:06.218
AND HE'S GETTING
A LITTLE HELP FROM D.A. JAMES.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.786
SHE JUST PRODUCED
A NEW WITNESS.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.656
SECOND 911 CALLER,
THE ONE WHO HEARD THE SHOTS,

33:10.689 --> 33:12.524
SHE TESTIFIES
TOMORROW.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.294
- AND SHE COMES FORWARD
TWO DAYS INTO PROVO'S TRIAL?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.528
THEY SANDBAGGED US.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.464
- PROVO GOT THE OTHERS
TO LIE FOR HIM.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.732
FIND OUT
WHAT HE'S GOT ON HER.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.304
[pounding at the door]

33:25.337 --> 33:27.073
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

33:27.106 --> 33:28.274
- LOOKING FOR CAROL MCEWAN.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.675
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HER?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.243
- CAROL, CAN WE SPEAK WITH YOU
PRIVATELY, PLEASE?

33:31.277 --> 33:32.578
- NO.
- WE'RE MARRIED TEN YEARS.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.746
I'M MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH MY HUSBAND HERE.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.748
- OKAY, WE'RE HERE--
- I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.584
MY 911 CALL.
THE D.A. TOLD ME

33:38.617 --> 33:43.355
NOT TO TALK TO ANYONE
BEFORE I TESTIFY, NOT EVEN COPS.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.557
- OKAY, BUT, UH,

33:45.591 --> 33:47.759
YOU LIVE A HALF HOUR
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.296
YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO BE DRIVING BY THAT NIGHT?

33:50.329 --> 33:52.564
- I WAS TAKING A SHORTCUT
TO MEET MY HUSBAND.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.566
IT WAS OUR ANNIVERSARY.
- OKAY?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.435
GOOD-BYE.
GO BACK TO THE CITY.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.603
SHE GOT NOTHING ELSE
TO SAY TO YOU.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.305
- CAROL, PLEASE.
- NO, I'M SORRY.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.341
- IF YOU'RE SCARED
OF MICHAEL PROVO--

34:07.413 --> 34:08.647
- WELL,
THAT WAS A WASTED TRIP.

34:08.680 --> 34:09.848
EITHER OF YOU
FIND ANY CONNECTION

34:09.881 --> 34:12.551
BETWEEN CAROL MCEWAN AND PROVO?
- NOT YET.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.187
HOWEVER HE REACHED HER,
HE COVERED HIS TRACKS.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.855
- SHE MAY NOT BE
THE CONNECTION.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.257
WHAT'D YOU MAKE
OF THE HUSBAND?

34:18.290 --> 34:21.127
- HE WAS PIECE OF CRAP.
- THREE-TIME LOSER.

34:21.160 --> 34:24.296
HE WAS PAROLED LAST JANUARY
AFTER A FIVE-YEAR BID

34:24.330 --> 34:25.864
IN QUEENSBORO CORRECTIONAL.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.668
FELONY, COCAINE SALES.
THE BEST PART--

34:31.570 --> 34:34.873
- THE INFORMANT
WHO SET HIM UP...

34:34.906 --> 34:38.177
TESTIFIED AGAINST HIM--
MICHAEL PROVO.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.148
- WAIT,
SO WHY IS EDDIE

34:42.181 --> 34:46.718
LETTING HIS WIFE
TESTIFY FOR PROVO?

34:46.752 --> 34:48.420
- THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY LAST PAY STUB.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.790
- EDDIE, GOT A MINUTE?

34:51.823 --> 34:53.459
- I TOLD YOU,
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.127
- NO, YOU TOLD US YOUR WIFE
HAD NOTHING TO SAY.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.628
WE WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.465
- YOU GOT NO REASON
TO BE BUSTIN' MY BALLS.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.867
I HAVEN'T BROKEN RECYCLING LAWS
SINCE I BEEN OUT.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.204
- MICHAEL PROVO.
YOU USED TO BE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.872
THAT'S HOW
HE SET YOU UP.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.709
- YEAH, SO-CALLED FRIEND.
STABBED ME IN THE BACK.

35:10.742 --> 35:13.212
EVERY WORD THAT HE EVER SAID
IS A LIE.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.913
- WELL, WHY'S YOUR WIFE
HELPING HIM, EDDIE?

35:14.946 --> 35:18.784
- IF I HAD ANY SAY,
SHE WOULDN'T BE.

35:18.817 --> 35:23.155
OKAY?

35:23.189 --> 35:27.193
- "IF I HAD ANY SAY"?
HE'S GOT CAROL COWED.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.496
- IT'S THE SAME WAY
TOMMY PUSHED JESSIE AROUND.

35:33.199 --> 35:36.935
OH.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.704
- CAROL.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.506
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO YOU.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.274
- SAYS WHO?

35:42.308 --> 35:47.213
YOUR HUSBAND...
OR MICHAEL PROVO?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.614
- YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE CHARGED
WITH PERJURY

35:48.647 --> 35:50.282
FOR LYING
IN FRONT OF A JURY?

35:50.316 --> 35:51.683
- WHO SAID
I WAS GOING TO LIE?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.185
- YOU TOLD US
YOU HEARD SHOTS

35:53.219 --> 35:55.221
ON THE WAY
TO YOUR ANNIVERSARY DINNER,

35:55.254 --> 35:56.922
BUT IT TURNS OUT
YOU TWO ARE COMMON LAW.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.558
- SO WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS A WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.893
- NO, IT WAS
ANOTHER KIND OF ANNIVERSARY.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.631
IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE EDDIE
WAS PAROLED FROM PRISON.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.933
- WHERE MICHAEL PROVO
HELPED TO SEND HIM.

36:07.966 --> 36:11.270
- SO YOU KNOW
WE DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.540
- EXCEPT WE CHECKED,

36:14.573 --> 36:17.243
AND EDDIE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
15 YEARS UPSTATE.

36:17.276 --> 36:20.712
INSTEAD, HE DOES FIVE
IN QUEENSBORO CORRECTIONAL

36:20.746 --> 36:21.913
IN LONG ISLAND CITY.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.250
THAT'S A LOT CLOSER
TO YOUR HOUSE.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.751
- HE GOT TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.753
- YEAH, AFTER MICHAEL PROVO
GOT THE D.A.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.390
TO INTERCEDE
ON HIS BEHALF.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.693
SEE, WE KNOW PROVO'S M.O.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.995
HE WAS HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

36:37.028 --> 36:39.931
WHILE YOUR HUSBAND
WAS AWAY.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.933
- YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.
- CAROL...

36:41.967 --> 36:44.236
IT'S WHAT HE DOES.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.906
HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN
WHO ARE ALREADY IN TROUBLE.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.908
- I LOVE MY HUSBAND.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.245
- DID PROVO THREATEN TO TELL
EDDIE ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR?

36:53.279 --> 36:56.882
- I'M EDDIE'S WHOLE WORLD.
IF HE FINDS OUT, HE'LL KILL ME.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.017
THEN HE'LL KILL HIMSELF.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.354
- AND WE DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO TELL HIM.

37:02.388 --> 37:06.825
BUT THERE'S AN INNOCENT WOMAN
WHO'S LOOKING AT 25 TO LIFE.

37:09.795 --> 37:13.965
- SO YOU'RE GONNA BLACKMAIL ME
INTO DOING WHAT'S RIGHT?

37:13.999 --> 37:18.870
WHO'S TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF WHO NOW?

37:18.904 --> 37:21.440
- WHAT IS GOING ON,
MR. BARBA?

37:21.473 --> 37:24.276
- PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BLINDSIDE YOU.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.512
I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED
THAT JESSIE'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY

37:26.545 --> 37:28.947
IS GONNA RECALL MR. PROVO
TO THE STAND.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.717
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
- NO? YOU SHOULD BE.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.720
- YOUR FRIEND,
GABRIEL GORROMINI,

37:34.753 --> 37:37.423
MISINFORMED
THE SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.525
JESSIE DIDN'T STEAL
THAT GUN FROM HIM.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.794
IN FACT, HE GAVE IT TO YOU,
MR. PROVO.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.330
- HE'S LYING.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.931
WHAT'D YOU DO,
JAM HIM UP ON HIS LICENSE?

37:45.964 --> 37:50.035
- NO. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID,
ACTUALLY.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.338
- OUR OFFICE IS ALREADY
LOOKING INTO THIS.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.072
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
THERE'S LOTS TO LOOK INTO.

37:54.105 --> 37:58.810
LET'S TAKE A WALK,
SHALL WE?

37:58.844 --> 38:00.312
- NOW,
THIS IS LARRY BANKS.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.880
HE WAS
THE FIRST 911 CALLER

38:01.913 --> 38:03.649
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.784
HE NOW ADMITS
THAT THE CALL WAS A FAKE.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.018
IT WAS JUST PAYBACK
TO MR. PROVO

38:07.052 --> 38:09.020
FOR GETTING HIM
OUT OF TWO DUIs.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.956
- I DID NO SUCH THING.
HAND TO GOD.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.958
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S CONTINUE.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.026
YOU REMEMBER
CAROL MCEWAN.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.696
SHE MADE
THE SECOND 911 CALL,

38:17.729 --> 38:20.366
REPORTING GUNSHOTS
THAT NOBODY ELSE HEARD...

38:20.399 --> 38:22.033
[taps on glass]

38:22.067 --> 38:23.902
MOMENTS BEFORE JESSIE
EVEN GOT THERE.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.737
- THIS IS MY WITNESS.
SHE'S ON MY LIST.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.006
- SHE'S ON MINE NOW.
- SHE'S GOING TO TESTIFY

38:28.039 --> 38:30.041
THAT SHE WAS BLACKMAILED
BY PROVO

38:30.075 --> 38:31.943
INTO MAKING
A FALSE REPORT.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.679
- THAT LYING BITCH.

38:33.712 --> 38:36.047
- YOUR FRAME'S COLLAPSING,
HUH, PROVO?

38:36.081 --> 38:38.450
YOU KNOW,
CAROL GAVE EVERYTHING UP.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.353
SHE EVEN SAVED
THE TEXTS THAT YOU SENT HER.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.054
- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW ANGRY
YOU MUST FEEL RIGHT NOW.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.056
YOU CAN SEE WHY I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.792
- DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THIS.
THEY'RE FRAMING ME--

38:46.825 --> 38:49.628
- MICHAEL.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.430
MR. BARBA,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

38:51.463 --> 38:54.099
THESE ALLEGATIONS
COME AS A COMPLETE SHOCK TO ME.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.901
YOU CAN BE ASSURED
THAT MY OFFICE

38:55.934 --> 38:57.603
WILL CONDUCT
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.038
- I'VE NO DOUBT YOU WILL.
- AND IN THE MEANTIME,

39:00.071 --> 39:02.974
ALL YOUR CHARGES AGAINST JESSIE
CAN BE DROPPED.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.743
- DUE DILIGENCE FIRST,
DETECTIVE.

39:04.776 --> 39:09.147
- DUE DILIGENCE?
I'D CALL IT SAVING FACE.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.917
JESSIE STURGIS IS INNOCENT.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.385
SHE HAS A CHILD
IN FOSTER CARE.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.921
- MORE TO THE POINT,
ONCE I GET MR. PROVO

39:15.954 --> 39:18.089
CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY,

39:18.123 --> 39:19.925
EVERY ONE OF YOUR CASES

39:19.958 --> 39:22.060
HE WAS INVOLVED WITH WILL BE
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.929
SO WILL YOUR OFFICE.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.564
- THINK ABOUT
WHAT THAT MEANS, PAM.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.700
- DON'T THREATEN ME.
EITHER OF YOU.

39:28.734 --> 39:32.070
- COUNSELOR...
NO THREAT WAS INTENDED.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.906
YOU AND I,
WE BOTH WANT THE SAME THING.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.008
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.
MISTAKES WERE MADE.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.512
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE BOTH WANT JUSTICE.

39:46.952 --> 39:50.622
- YES, OF COURSE.

39:50.656 --> 39:53.759
LET'S KEEP THIS SIMPLE,
THEN.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.628
TOMMY BANDOLCE
WAS KILLED IN BABYLON.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.964
IF YOU WITHDRAW
ALL CHARGES AGAINST PROVO,

39:58.997 --> 40:02.033
I WILL WITHDRAW
ALL CHARGES AGAINST JESSIE.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.935
- THE HELL YOU WILL.
- AND YOU WILL FILE

40:03.969 --> 40:04.936
MURDER CHARGES AGAINST PROVO
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY?

40:04.970 --> 40:06.171
- ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?

40:06.204 --> 40:08.106
- AND CONDUCT
AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION

40:08.139 --> 40:10.709
INTO ALL CASES
HE WAS INVOLVED IN.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.011
- YOU'D REALLY
SELL ME OUT, PAM?

40:13.044 --> 40:15.213
AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR YOU?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.015
YOU'D STILL BE
PUTTING YOUR TITS ON THE TABLE

40:17.048 --> 40:18.484
FOR TRAFFIC COURT JUDGES
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME!

40:18.517 --> 40:20.018
- GET HIM
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.020
- COME ON.
- OKAY.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.922
IF I'M GOING DOWN,
YOU'RE GOING DOWN TOO.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.726
I WILL BURY YOU!
I WILL BURY YOU!

40:31.029 --> 40:33.865
- OH, MY GOD!
MATTHEW!

40:33.899 --> 40:37.002
HI.
HI, HONEY. OH!

40:37.035 --> 40:39.671
- LOOK,
I LOST ANOTHER TOOTH.

40:39.705 --> 40:43.008
- OH! WELL, WE BETTER LET
THE TOOTH FAIRY KNOW, RIGHT?

40:46.578 --> 40:49.981
IT'S OVER NOW?
THEY CAN'T HURT US ANYMORE?

40:50.015 --> 40:52.984
- PROVO'S GOING AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.522
- WHAT ABOUT THE REST
OF THE CASE?

40:56.555 --> 40:59.658
WHAT MICHAEL DID TO ME?

40:59.691 --> 41:01.527
- HEY, MATTY,
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME

41:01.560 --> 41:04.095
THAT MISSING TOOTH, HUH?

41:04.129 --> 41:08.099
- JESSIE...

41:08.133 --> 41:11.837
WE HAD
TO WITHDRAW CHARGES.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.805
- WHAT?

41:13.839 --> 41:18.076
BUT...HE RAPED ME.
HE BEAT ME.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.045
HE LEFT ME BLEEDING
IN THE STREET.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.148
- BARBA HAD TO MAKE A DEAL
TO GET YOU OUT RIGHT AWAY.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.718
THAT WAS--
THAT WAS THE PRIORITY.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.187
- AND THE RAPE
NEVER HAPPENED?

41:29.220 --> 41:32.490
- LEGALLY, NO.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.699
JESSIE, TAKE MATTHEW HOME.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.102
YOU WON.

41:44.135 --> 41:47.005
- THAT ONE'S LOOSE TOO.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.239
JUST LET IT FALL OUT.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.976
JUST DON'T YANK IT.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.880
- HEY, MATTY.

41:54.913 --> 42:00.251
- RAPED, PUT IN JAIL,
HER KID TAKEN AWAY.

42:00.285 --> 42:05.123
I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE HELD IT TOGETHER.

42:05.156 --> 42:08.727
- SHE DID IT
FOR HER SON.

42:45.330 --> 42:48.299
[wolf howls]
