Watch your spacing. Stay in line!

00:20.488 --> 00:24.124
Music. Music!

00:24.159 --> 00:28.195
Good. Good.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.795
Stop! Stop.

00:48.799 --> 00:53.036
<i>And that is why she's an
understudy and not prima ballerina.</i>

00:53.103 --> 00:55.504
What kind of lazy
entrance was that, Natasha?

00:55.572 --> 00:57.506
I'm sorry Micah. I can do better.

00:57.574 --> 00:59.976
Well what are you waiting
for, an invitation?

00:59.984 --> 01:02.485
Do better, Miss Azarov!

01:02.519 --> 01:04.787
We leave for Singapore in 3
days, if you haven't got it

01:04.855 --> 01:08.623
by now maybe we should
just cancel the whole tour.

01:08.657 --> 01:12.928
Now. Again, from the beginning. Go, go, go.

01:16.966 --> 01:19.101
Thanks for this. Jewel
was supposed to meet me

01:19.168 --> 01:21.103
in the auditorium about an hour ago.

01:21.170 --> 01:23.105
Yeah, she's been known
to keep people waiting.

01:23.139 --> 01:25.107
<i>It's the whole prima ballerina thing</i>

01:25.141 --> 01:28.110
- (whispers) it goes to their heads.
- Oh good, should be fun.

01:28.144 --> 01:29.102
Mrs. Harper? Tia Tremblay, the reporter.

01:29.110 --> 01:31.854
- We were supposed to meet.
- I don't think she's there.

01:31.948 --> 01:33.383
Ok, let me just call.

01:35.187 --> 01:37.188
(phone rings inside room)

01:37.222 --> 01:38.625
Weird. She never goes
anywhere without her phone.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.925
Jewel? Are you in there? Are you ok?

01:40.993 --> 01:42.227
We're coming in, Jewel.

02:02.314 --> 02:04.581
Ah!

02:05.850 --> 02:09.419
Slow down. What are you
trying to break a record there?

02:09.454 --> 02:11.655
What? I'm starving. Haven't
eaten since last night.

02:11.689 --> 02:13.690
I'm so worried about running
into Sandy at the hospital

02:13.725 --> 02:15.793
that I've been avoiding the cafeteria.

02:15.883 --> 02:18.585
Well I thought you guys
ended on good terms?

02:18.619 --> 02:21.020
Ish. I mean, it's still awkward.

02:21.054 --> 02:23.022
It's hard to get over
your ex when you're running

02:23.056 --> 02:25.191
into her everywhere like
the lunchroom, hallways...

02:25.225 --> 02:27.393
The only place I can be sure I
won't see her is the men's room.

02:27.427 --> 02:29.395
Quite frankly people are starting to talk.

02:29.429 --> 02:31.964
You can't avoid her forever, right?

02:31.999 --> 02:35.301
Well I know. Just, um... for
now I'm happy I got this place.

02:35.335 --> 02:37.703
Cheers to that, brother. Good for you.

02:40.807 --> 02:43.009
Hey speaking of
uncomfortable work situations,

02:43.043 --> 02:46.210
- how's the new boss treating ya?
- Ah he doesn't trust me.

02:46.312 --> 02:48.313
Honestly I don't know
if I trust him, either.

02:48.381 --> 02:50.348
I don't know what the
guy's thinking, you know.

02:50.383 --> 02:53.151
You don't know what he's thinking?

02:53.285 --> 02:55.720
Do you realize the irony of that statement?

02:55.754 --> 02:58.723
- I get it.
- Are you gonna tell him 'bout your... ?

02:58.757 --> 03:01.292
What? No. Are you kidding me? I
don't know how he's gonna react.

03:01.327 --> 03:03.362
- You don't think he's going to find out eventually?
- Toby!

03:03.496 --> 03:05.189
- Yeah?
- Something's happened.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.190
You ok?

03:07.199 --> 03:09.531
- The article I was writing...
- Yeah, the ballerina thing.

03:10.463 --> 03:12.430
Jewel told me she had
information that would

03:12.465 --> 03:14.399
bring the entire company
down. When I got there,

03:14.467 --> 03:16.667
her dressing room was completely trashed

03:16.669 --> 03:18.770
- and she's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?

03:19.205 --> 03:21.172
She's disappeared.

03:21.207 --> 03:23.307
And I think someone might
have done something to her.

03:27.279 --> 03:31.140
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:34.911 --> 03:36.879
- Hey.
- Ian, hey.

03:36.946 --> 03:38.565
- Hey Dev.
- Inspector Becker?

03:38.566 --> 03:39.986
Yeah.

03:40.150 --> 03:43.052
Tia Tremblay, Daily Record.
We actually met years ago,

03:43.120 --> 03:45.898
- I covered the Hastings story.
- Yes, yeah.

03:46.022 --> 03:47.056
You and your team did
an amazing job getting

03:47.124 --> 03:49.925
- that kid back home safely.
- Thank you.

03:49.993 --> 03:51.927
I brought Tia in because
she's working on a story

03:51.995 --> 03:53.698
- about the Northern Skies Ballet.
- Stop.

03:53.832 --> 03:56.564
You're not about to pitch me a
case from a reporter, are you?

03:56.684 --> 04:00.168
<i>Jewel Harper, the prima
ballerina, has gone missing.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:02.590
That sounds like a Metro case. Thanks.

04:02.632 --> 04:04.907
They're not lifting a finger for 48 hours.

04:04.974 --> 04:07.531
- That's the procedure.
- Procedure's wrong.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.522
48 hours can be too late.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.279
When Jewel Harper contacted me,

04:11.312 --> 04:13.514
she told me there was
corruption within the company.

04:13.539 --> 04:15.295
and she was scared for her safety.

04:15.484 --> 04:16.985
I show up to do the interview,

04:17.027 --> 04:18.800
and her dressing room's completely trashed,

04:18.815 --> 04:19.968
she's nowhere to be found

04:19.993 --> 04:22.095
and she's left behind her
cellphone and her wallet.

04:22.215 --> 04:23.035
Jewel Harper?

04:23.052 --> 04:25.699
She's married to the artistic
director of the company, right?

04:27.296 --> 04:30.261
What? Guys I used to date a ballerina.

04:30.381 --> 04:31.825
Yeah, Micah Canet, he's...

04:31.841 --> 04:34.010
also the resident choreographer.

04:34.130 --> 04:36.552
So you think someone found
out about the interview

04:36.581 --> 04:38.446
and was afraid you were
going to expose them?

04:38.639 --> 04:41.421
The company leaves for
Singapore in 36 hours.

04:41.541 --> 04:44.547
We can't afford to wait for
Metro to start investigating this.

04:44.791 --> 04:48.312
Solving a high-profile case like this
would be really good for the unit.

04:48.432 --> 04:50.059
Ballerinas.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.303
Ok, solve it.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.370
But solve it fast.

04:56.981 --> 04:58.259
Not so bad.

04:58.379 --> 04:59.788
Yeah.

05:02.897 --> 05:05.267
Jewel may be our star dancer Micah,

05:05.276 --> 05:06.494
but enough is enough.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.192
She's costing me too much
money, too much aggravation.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.494
I agree, but cancel? No.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.124
Natasha will replace Jewel.

05:13.670 --> 05:16.123
Natasha? Jewel will have a fit.

05:16.243 --> 05:17.644
Mr. Canet?

05:17.838 --> 05:19.060
Yes.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.815
We'd like to speak to you
about your wife's disappearance.

05:21.849 --> 05:22.973
Ugh.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.866
Ok excuse me. Can we pick this up later?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.376
Come find me.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.948
Like I told the other
officers, Jewel's a high-strung,

05:30.965 --> 05:32.972
dramatic woman. She's done this before.

05:33.006 --> 05:34.544
She's disappeared before?

05:34.931 --> 05:35.897
Why?

05:36.017 --> 05:37.914
Well she loves the attention.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.630
Feeds on it.

05:39.637 --> 05:41.141
She finds that the police
are looking for her,

05:41.167 --> 05:43.167
she's going to love it
even more. I'm sorry,

05:43.287 --> 05:44.436
she's wasting your time.

05:44.461 --> 05:46.285
And her dressing room being trashed?

05:46.310 --> 05:47.243
I mean how would you explain that?

05:47.251 --> 05:49.553
She's never done that before but it could

05:49.673 --> 05:52.024
very likely have been another
one of her temper tantrums.

05:52.058 --> 05:54.243
And where does she go
during these tantrums?

05:54.260 --> 05:55.327
I don't know.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.815
Maybe you should talk to her friend Alya.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.495
We had someone speak to her.
Jewel didn't show up there.

05:59.857 --> 06:02.202
- Huh.
- So you had rehearsal here,

06:02.322 --> 06:04.723
- yesterday at 5pm?
- I did.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.692
Where were you before that?

06:06.760 --> 06:09.242
I was in and out with meetings.

06:09.277 --> 06:11.134
Who were those meetings with?

06:12.025 --> 06:14.016
I'll have my secretary
email you my schedule.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.361
Should I know something here?

06:15.386 --> 06:17.898
This is starting to feel a
little like an interrogation.

06:18.018 --> 06:20.596
Not at all. We're just trying to
figure out what happened to your wife.

06:20.716 --> 06:22.890
What is your relationship like?

06:23.158 --> 06:25.309
Ah, well.

06:25.429 --> 06:27.074
You know, we're passionate people.

06:27.116 --> 06:29.343
So we have our ups and downs.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.057
You're nothing without me.

06:32.177 --> 06:34.216
I made you.

06:36.426 --> 06:37.948
Is that all?

06:38.191 --> 06:40.990
- What are you insinuating?
- I think that's all for now.

06:41.922 --> 06:43.014
Here's my card.

06:43.039 --> 06:45.468
Please give me a call if you
hear anything from your wife.

06:45.493 --> 06:46.855
I will.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.922
Just see. She'll be back here any second.

06:48.922 --> 06:51.435
This will all just have been
another one of her dramas.

06:53.839 --> 06:55.452
I saw them argue.

06:55.572 --> 06:57.586
He was angry. He was threatening Jewel.

06:57.796 --> 06:59.981
I say we bring him in and
sweat him a little bit.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.569
I don't want to make Becker suspicious

07:01.612 --> 07:04.024
of how we made the leap. We need more.

07:04.671 --> 07:05.755
True.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.569
There's no sign of forced entry.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.880
Yeah. There's some blood over here.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.771
That's a passive spatter.

07:15.225 --> 07:16.603
She cut herself.

07:16.723 --> 07:18.830
Or someone cut her.

07:20.158 --> 07:21.628
On this?

07:22.283 --> 07:24.443
And then the blood smeared over here.

07:24.737 --> 07:28.586
Yes. And someone picked up that vase and...

07:29.435 --> 07:31.645
and threw it towards this mirror.

07:31.678 --> 07:33.031
There's some blood down here.

07:33.151 --> 07:34.956
Those droplets are pretty large.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.376
Tear-drop shaped.

07:36.384 --> 07:38.779
You can't get that from
cutting yourself on glass.

07:38.788 --> 07:41.267
Someone threw something at
her to create that splatter.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.981
Lets test both areas of blood.

07:44.258 --> 07:46.569
I bet we'll get two different sets of DNA.

07:46.689 --> 07:48.258
I bet you're right.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.250
I know I'm right.

07:51.161 --> 07:52.838
(laughter)

07:53.569 --> 07:56.553
Hey. What do you guys have for us?

07:57.032 --> 07:58.906
Well what you see here was

07:58.931 --> 08:01.821
not done by one person. There
were clearly signs of a struggle.

08:01.855 --> 08:03.149
Any witnesses?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.308
Well we've spoken to almost
everyone and no one seems

08:05.317 --> 08:06.443
to have heard or seen anything.

08:06.451 --> 08:08.451
The assistant stage
manager was the last person

08:08.451 --> 08:10.760
to see Jewel and that was just before 9am.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.612
And then it wasn't until Toby's
girlfriend came in at 7:15

08:13.637 --> 08:14.788
that they realized she was gone.

08:14.822 --> 08:17.368
So this could've happened
anytime between 9 and 7.

08:17.394 --> 08:20.183
Dev I need you to check
out Micah Canet's alibi.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.444
He says that he was in
meetings all day yesterday.

08:22.564 --> 08:24.705
- Ok.
- You guys found her cellphone?

08:24.738 --> 08:25.635
Yep.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.688
She texted her friend,
Alya. Said she was scared.

08:29.814 --> 08:32.226
I should be on the list.

08:32.604 --> 08:34.259
Be right back.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.066
- Yeah sorry, I can't...
- You sure?

08:38.100 --> 08:39.486
- Hey!
- No access?

08:40.260 --> 08:41.898
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

08:41.923 --> 08:44.545
My editor's on me. He wants me
to file a story this afternoon.

08:44.665 --> 08:47.671
Look, I can't tell you anything
about this investigation, Tia.

08:47.707 --> 08:50.840
I know. But, I can print
rumours or you know,

08:50.865 --> 08:53.428
you can give me something solid to go off.

08:54.369 --> 08:55.613
Come on, Toby.

08:55.646 --> 08:57.999
Can you just at least confirm
for me that you're mistaken.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.166
Just, something. Just a
little nod of the head.

09:00.286 --> 09:02.646
- Tell me I'm right.
- Honestly, we still don't know.

09:02.839 --> 09:05.805
Call me in a few hours. Maybe
I can give you something then.

09:05.925 --> 09:08.293
But you know what, I have
a question for you actually.

09:08.309 --> 09:10.200
Yeah, nice. I see how
this is going to work.

09:10.629 --> 09:13.402
Did Jewel ever mention
that Micah was abusive?

09:13.915 --> 09:17.503
No. But honestly, wouldn't be surprised.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.123
I've been doing a little digging
around and there was an incident

09:20.133 --> 09:22.429
about a year ago. No charges were laid,

09:22.549 --> 09:24.621
but the police showed up at their house

09:24.638 --> 09:26.697
after a 911 call from
the neighbours describing

09:26.714 --> 09:28.319
what they thought was
a pretty serious fight.

09:28.439 --> 09:30.436
That is very interesting. Thank you.

09:30.556 --> 09:32.461
<i>No, but. Hey!</i>

09:32.797 --> 09:34.738
Ever heard of quid pro quo ?

09:53.312 --> 09:55.344
(phone vibrating)

09:56.411 --> 09:57.882
Ok.

09:58.789 --> 10:01.033
Hey, everything ok?

10:01.050 --> 10:03.597
Yeah, yeah. I just, um,

10:03.639 --> 10:05.009
I missed you guys.

10:05.129 --> 10:06.530
[How's everything going there?]

10:06.580 --> 10:07.900
We're good.

10:08.194 --> 10:10.581
She's asleep, hence the whispering.

10:10.701 --> 10:12.018
I figured.

10:12.138 --> 10:14.598
You know babe, we're ok. You
don't have to worry about us.

10:14.718 --> 10:15.866
Oh I'm...

10:15.986 --> 10:17.791
I'm not worried. I just,

10:17.911 --> 10:20.379
I miss her. Can't I miss her?

10:21.278 --> 10:23.329
Yes. Of course.

10:23.362 --> 10:25.724
- (knocking) She's here.
- Ok.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.388
I gotta go. I'll call you later, ok?

10:28.508 --> 10:30.136
- [Hey Mich?]
- Yeah?

10:30.582 --> 10:32.396
We miss you, too.

10:36.716 --> 10:39.926
We understand this isn't the
first time Jewel has disappeared.

10:40.254 --> 10:43.321
Everyone we've spoken to
says she's a bit of a diva,

10:43.347 --> 10:45.128
that she's done this before.

10:45.248 --> 10:47.818
Like I told the officer
back at the theatre, yes.

10:48.095 --> 10:51.465
Sure, Jewel's demanding,
but she's a professional.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.062
She would never leave so
close to a performance,

10:54.072 --> 10:55.280
let alone a tour.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.549
You weren't concerned when you
received the text messages from her?

10:58.574 --> 11:00.339
Of course I was, but...

11:01.079 --> 11:02.541
I don't know.

11:02.566 --> 11:04.289
Jewel can be dramatic.

11:04.659 --> 11:06.600
"I'm scared, Alya.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.516
I think he's done with me.

11:08.636 --> 11:09.781
They're pushing me out."

11:09.785 --> 11:11.404
What does that mean? Pushing her out?

11:11.524 --> 11:13.146
Jewel was paranoid a younger dancer

11:13.146 --> 11:14.826
was going to come and take her place.

11:15.297 --> 11:16.793
It happens to all of us.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.558
Was that happening to her?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.499
Honestly, um...

11:20.619 --> 11:23.866
Since my early retirement I've
stayed clear of all the rumours.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.953
I'm happy to just teach the
little ballerinas of tomorrow.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.281
Alright well she wrote "I'm scared."

11:29.401 --> 11:31.903
What is she referring
to? Her husband, Micah?

11:32.541 --> 11:33.961
Possibly.

11:34.264 --> 11:35.667
I don't know.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.858
Don't say anything, Alya. Promise?

11:44.111 --> 11:47.086
Did she ever mention if Micah was abusive?

11:48.716 --> 11:50.489
I... I don't know.

11:50.531 --> 11:52.926
Yeah, well. Look, I know this is hard.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.220
She's your friend... She's my best friend.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.027
We grew up together,

11:57.036 --> 11:58.666
we dreamed about dancing together.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.574
Well then you should have
her best interests at heart.

12:01.893 --> 12:03.632
Tell us everything.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.556
Did she have an argument
with anyone yesterday?

12:07.843 --> 12:09.809
Possibly Micah?

12:10.851 --> 12:12.817
It's possible.

12:12.937 --> 12:14.145
Yeah.

12:14.683 --> 12:16.094
But I didn't see anything.

12:16.214 --> 12:18.724
But he has hurt her in the past?

12:20.069 --> 12:21.923
Yeah he has.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.313
And did she call the police?

12:24.582 --> 12:27.599
No. She was embarrassed
to look like a victim.

12:27.719 --> 12:30.064
I mean she'd hate that I
told you guys any of this.

12:30.132 --> 12:31.801
She had too much pride.

12:32.036 --> 12:34.070
- Hm. Well.
- (Knocking)

12:35.044 --> 12:36.843
Oh. I'll be right back.

12:40.474 --> 12:43.499
So it looks like Micah
and Jewel own two cars.

12:43.524 --> 12:45.692
One of which is a black C-class Mercedes

12:45.718 --> 12:48.995
and I got a hit of the license
plate on a 407 traffic cam.

12:49.029 --> 12:49.853
Where?

12:49.895 --> 12:51.105
Well, the car

12:51.147 --> 12:54.087
exited at Wilbur highway
about an hour north.

12:54.088 --> 12:55.457
That was yesterday at 12:30pm.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.020
And when did it come back on?

12:57.259 --> 12:58.340
Well that's the thing.

12:58.365 --> 13:00.012
It didn't get back on the highway.

13:00.801 --> 13:03.507
Well all that's up there are
some cottages and Wilbur Park.

13:03.531 --> 13:05.163
Let's get our people patrolling the area.

13:05.213 --> 13:06.609
I was actually going to go up there myself.

13:06.659 --> 13:07.785
Ok Toby and I are almost done here,

13:07.794 --> 13:08.735
we'll meet you there.

13:12.913 --> 13:14.854
The car's registered to Micah Canet.

13:14.879 --> 13:16.425
There's blood stains there and there.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.770
All four tires were punctured

13:17.770 --> 13:19.887
which more than likely happened
when they tried to enter the park.

13:19.912 --> 13:23.392
Park's closed for the off-season
there's spike barriers at every entrance.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.795
Well that explains why the car
never made it onto the highway.

13:25.795 --> 13:27.005
So how'd the perp get outta here?

13:27.215 --> 13:28.794
Walked? Rode?

13:28.794 --> 13:32.006
Who knows? Maybe they had a
car parked somewhere close by.

13:32.126 --> 13:34.970
Over here you can see a
small, minute blood trail.

13:34.979 --> 13:36.559
That leads up to the river.

13:36.768 --> 13:38.146
These boot prints you see here,

13:38.146 --> 13:40.508
they belong to the perp.
They go off in that direction

13:40.541 --> 13:42.709
- and then they get lost.
- Ok can we get casts made of those?

13:42.726 --> 13:44.634
- Of course. Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:45.222 --> 13:48.466
We found these by the river:

13:48.659 --> 13:50.726
- a piece of clothing.
- And a toque.

13:51.138 --> 13:52.835
They Jewel's?

13:52.861 --> 13:55.423
We won't know until we get
the DNA test results back.

13:55.781 --> 13:57.482
- We're still looking for the body.
- (phone rings)

13:59.658 --> 14:00.852
Becker?

14:00.886 --> 14:02.288
[Tell me you found her McCluskey, ]

14:02.321 --> 14:04.246
because the media's
hounding me for a statement.

14:04.296 --> 14:06.078
[Not yet, sir, but this looks

14:06.103 --> 14:08.448
[like it's more than a
missing person's case.]

14:08.465 --> 14:10.313
I think we have a homicide on our hands.

14:14.548 --> 14:16.060
Rumours are running wild, Toby.

14:16.069 --> 14:17.304
You've gotta give me something.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.976
Tia, I've been ordered
not to speak to the media.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.918
Ok. So then don't say anything.

14:21.934 --> 14:24.346
You can't get in trouble if
you don't say anything. Can you?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.649
Where are you going with this?

14:25.682 --> 14:28.161
I'm going to make a statement.
If I'm right, keep quiet.

14:28.187 --> 14:29.850
Simple. Here we go.

14:30.262 --> 14:32.766
Jewel was abducted from her dressing room.

14:34.397 --> 14:36.052
And...

14:36.657 --> 14:39.657
you found evidence [leading
you to believe she was killed.]

14:39.708 --> 14:42.363
You heard that from an anonymous source.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.703
- You ok?
- [I...

14:46.741 --> 14:49.069
yeah I just feel

14:49.338 --> 14:51.582
somewhat responsible if she died

14:51.607 --> 14:53.414
because she was gonna talk to me.

14:53.534 --> 14:54.372
[Tia, if it wasn't you]

14:54.389 --> 14:56.145
it would have been another reporter.

14:56.338 --> 14:58.296
- [It's not your fault.]
- I know.

14:58.416 --> 14:59.767
[Go follow your story.]

14:59.792 --> 15:01.464
We'll talk later.

15:02.313 --> 15:05.212
The boot print found in
the park is a men's size 10.

15:05.246 --> 15:07.195
I should have the cast
finished in a few hours.

15:07.229 --> 15:08.422
What about the tooth?

15:08.456 --> 15:11.885
A left central incisor
or the top front tooth.

15:11.901 --> 15:14.952
It appears to have been extracted
with a blunt force to the jaw.

15:15.002 --> 15:17.364
You can see the crack
and the chip right here.

15:17.390 --> 15:18.684
Is it Jewel's?

15:18.701 --> 15:21.196
We can't be sure but it does match the DNA

15:21.223 --> 15:23.339
found in the park and in the dressing room.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.701
However, if you remember,

15:24.726 --> 15:27.012
there were two sets of
bloody prints in that room.

15:27.037 --> 15:28.826
And only one of them is a match.

15:28.851 --> 15:30.885
Ok, so if we find out who
was in Jewel's dressing room

15:30.899 --> 15:32.439
maybe we find our killer.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.691
Ok, thanks.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.469
Let's see what we can get out of Micah.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.611
What the hell's going on here?

15:43.678 --> 15:46.238
You ask for a sample of my DNA, I said yes.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.070
You keep me locked in this room?

15:48.190 --> 15:51.801
When I asked for an explanation not
one person can give me an answer.

15:52.044 --> 15:53.977
Mr. Canet, please. Have a seat.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.372
I don't have time for this.

15:55.574 --> 15:57.641
My tour for Singapore is days away.

15:57.674 --> 15:59.952
Now where is my wife? What's going on here?

15:59.952 --> 16:02.079
Mr. Canet you need to calm down.

16:09.999 --> 16:13.007
We believe that your wife was abducted

16:13.881 --> 16:16.814
and there's a chance that
she may have been killed.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.546
What? No, no, no.

16:22.085 --> 16:24.581
Wh... Sh... she was, wh...

16:24.589 --> 16:28.942
Jewel disappeared sometime
between 9am and 7pm yesterday.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.833
Where were you during that time?

16:30.953 --> 16:33.144
I uh. Wh... , I...

16:33.833 --> 16:36.437
I told you, I... I was with a sponsor.

16:36.975 --> 16:39.564
Your assistant gave us your itinerary.

16:39.857 --> 16:44.437
The only thing you had was a
meeting with Mr. Bernard Coss

16:44.479 --> 16:47.428
- at 9am.
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.439
Well we spoke to Mr. Coss and he said

16:49.474 --> 16:51.311
that your meeting ended at 10am.

16:51.572 --> 16:55.000
We know that you were
at the theatre at 5pm.

16:55.025 --> 16:57.546
So where were you between 10 and 5?

16:59.428 --> 17:02.467
I... I had lunch. Um, I did some errands.

17:02.587 --> 17:06.436
Is it possible you were with
Jewel, in her dressing room?

17:13.621 --> 17:16.108
Or maybe you were somewhere
you shouldn't have been?

17:16.394 --> 17:18.578
With someone you shouldn't have been with?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.948
Are you having an affair?

17:22.242 --> 17:23.385
What?

17:23.505 --> 17:26.512
- No. No! Of course not.
- Who's it with?

17:26.632 --> 17:27.980
One of the dancers?

17:28.099 --> 17:30.061
Maybe Jewel's understudy?

17:31.033 --> 17:32.731
- No.
- Natasha.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.546
Is that who it was?

17:34.666 --> 17:36.101
Where did that come from?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.589
- We have sources.
- I want my lawyer.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.000
Now.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.439
Of course.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.488
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

17:45.608 --> 17:47.286
What's your shoe size?

17:47.715 --> 17:48.984
10. Why?

17:49.824 --> 17:52.698
We'll make sure that you
get your lawyer right away.

17:58.998 --> 18:00.317
Nice work.

18:00.437 --> 18:02.830
Just saw his reaction when
you brought up Natasha.

18:02.950 --> 18:04.334
Phew. It's impressive.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.124
Hundreds of dancers and
you got there in 5 seconds.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.158
Yeah well she's someone we should talk to.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.885
Yeah I still think we
should hold onto him though.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.342
His alibi is weak, it's
the right shoe size.

18:13.351 --> 18:15.006
He's our prime suspect.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.024
But we're gonna need a
search warrant for his house.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.049
We need to find those boots.

18:18.082 --> 18:19.742
Ok, I'll start the paperwork.

18:20.242 --> 18:21.730
Ok, great.

18:26.058 --> 18:27.957
I want a copy of this

18:28.007 --> 18:30.192
interrogation video sent to me.

18:30.881 --> 18:32.007
Only me.

18:32.127 --> 18:34.225
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

18:35.973 --> 18:38.519
Natasha, we know that
you are having an affair

18:38.536 --> 18:40.317
with Jewel's husband, Micah.

18:40.645 --> 18:42.040
What?

18:42.485 --> 18:44.006
No. Who told you this?

18:44.126 --> 18:45.981
You saw him yesterday, right?

18:46.863 --> 18:49.242
No, it is not true. I was at the theatre.

18:49.889 --> 18:52.192
Lying is only going to get
yourself into more trouble.

18:52.754 --> 18:55.678
<i>If anyone finds out I
slept with him for the role</i>

18:55.798 --> 18:57.527
<i>it will ruin me.</i>

18:57.930 --> 19:00.190
You've got more than your
reputation to lose here

19:00.207 --> 19:01.669
if you don't cooperate with us.

19:02.594 --> 19:04.552
We know you saw her yesterday.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.844
Come in.

19:14.678 --> 19:15.728
She...

19:16.123 --> 19:18.434
She invited me to her dressing room.

19:18.554 --> 19:19.711
To talk.

19:19.831 --> 19:23.139
Ah! You're trying to steal my whole life!

19:23.921 --> 19:26.467
First my husband, now my career.

19:26.587 --> 19:29.148
Ah! (Panting)

19:30.778 --> 19:32.132
And what time was that?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.106
Around 10:30?

19:34.401 --> 19:36.190
Where'd you get that cut?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.140
Just a scratch from my cat.

19:40.174 --> 19:42.745
So you won't mind giving us
a sample of your DNA, then?

19:43.576 --> 19:44.770
DNA?

19:44.890 --> 19:46.291
Why, what for?

19:46.594 --> 19:49.115
<i>Why did I listen to Micah?</i>

19:49.417 --> 19:51.896
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

19:53.182 --> 19:54.501
No.

19:54.829 --> 19:56.913
I know nothing.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.954
Ok, well I think that's all for now.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.778
- You're free to go.
- Thank you.

20:09.585 --> 20:12.249
I think Micah may have had an accomplice.

20:12.585 --> 20:13.971
Mrs. Gollnow?

20:13.997 --> 20:14.854
Tia Tremblay.

20:14.870 --> 20:16.828
I know as head of the board you
must have your hands full right now,

20:16.837 --> 20:18.618
but I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.

20:18.644 --> 20:20.240
Tia Tremblay.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.475
Someone passed along the online
article you published this afternoon.

20:23.517 --> 20:25.736
You're clearly a fan of sensationalism.

20:25.856 --> 20:28.296
It's the first of a series of
articles I plan on publishing,

20:28.416 --> 20:29.820
until this matter is resolved.

20:29.856 --> 20:31.593
What can I do for you, Ms. Tremblay?

20:32.072 --> 20:34.904
Jewel claimed there was
corruption within the company.

20:35.459 --> 20:37.182
But of course every story has two sides,

20:37.207 --> 20:38.140
I'd love to hear yours.

20:38.173 --> 20:41.240
Jewel is hardly qualified to
imply that the company is corrupt.

20:41.887 --> 20:43.904
Would you care to elaborate?

20:44.367 --> 20:46.543
No. I do not.

20:47.266 --> 20:50.274
But I am truly deeply
saddened, Ms. Tremblay,

20:50.299 --> 20:52.526
by the events that have occurred
in the past couple of days.

20:52.646 --> 20:55.114
We here at the ballet consider
Jewel to be a part of our family

20:55.234 --> 20:56.803
and she will be greatly missed.

20:58.274 --> 21:00.593
It sounds like you've
already decided she's dead.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.383
This interview is over.

21:11.072 --> 21:12.643
So where are we on this?

21:12.920 --> 21:15.660
Well, if the killer dumped
the body in the river,

21:15.710 --> 21:18.971
then it could take months to
recover it underneath all that ice.

21:19.091 --> 21:20.671
What about our suspects?

21:20.739 --> 21:23.458
Well at 11:30pm last night,

21:23.483 --> 21:27.676
Jewel sent texts to her friend
Alya saying that she was scared.

21:27.796 --> 21:31.314
Micah claims to have last seen
her at 7am the next morning.

21:31.365 --> 21:33.012
The assistant stage manager

21:33.037 --> 21:34.903
saw Jewel enter her dressing room at 9am.

21:34.911 --> 21:36.760
At 10:30am Natasha Azarov

21:36.777 --> 21:38.920
went to the same dressing room
where an argument took place.

21:38.936 --> 21:41.776
Yeah Natasha joined the ballet
company about a year and a half ago.

21:41.793 --> 21:44.499
Since then she's worked her way
up to becoming the understudy.

21:44.516 --> 21:47.339
We believe Natasha is having an affair

21:47.348 --> 21:49.818
with the artistic director, Micah Canet.

21:49.844 --> 21:52.264
Who also happens to be Jewel's husband.

21:52.384 --> 21:55.625
We suspect that Natasha
and Micah were together

21:55.745 --> 21:58.482
between the hours of 11am and 5pm.

21:58.524 --> 22:00.634
Which neither will admit to.

22:00.970 --> 22:04.348
So sounds like Micah and
Natasha are each other's alibi.

22:04.592 --> 22:06.659
I mean, did they kill her together?

22:06.779 --> 22:09.903
Well we only found the one set
of male bootprints at the park.

22:09.936 --> 22:13.063
So the likelihood that Natasha
was there is slim at best.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.778
Thank you.

22:16.064 --> 22:18.719
Ok, here we go. As you can see,

22:19.013 --> 22:23.652
the wear marks on the tread are
almost exactly like Micah's boots.

22:23.772 --> 22:25.601
Well that puts Micah at the park.

22:25.668 --> 22:27.651
Well, maybe not.

22:27.771 --> 22:31.197
I made this from the boot
prints that we found in the snow.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.038
It does show the same wear
patterns as Micah Canet's boots.

22:34.077 --> 22:36.954
But the depth of the imprint
tells a different story.

22:36.988 --> 22:39.601
Micah weighs approximately 175lbs.

22:39.643 --> 22:42.551
The person wearing these
boots weighs at most 120.

22:43.147 --> 22:45.324
So Micah didn't make the boot prints.

22:45.444 --> 22:47.357
Someone was framing him.

22:47.912 --> 22:49.425
Could it be Natasha?

22:50.475 --> 22:53.325
Natasha kills Jewel and
then frames her lover?

22:53.329 --> 22:55.055
Why? What's the motive?

22:55.431 --> 22:57.399
Let's bring her in and find out.

22:58.189 --> 22:59.559
Ok.

23:04.211 --> 23:06.917
<i>(Michelle): Your DNA
tests came back, Natasha.</i>

23:07.324 --> 23:10.353
Those scratches on your
arm, they came from Jewel.

23:11.195 --> 23:12.798
Yes.

23:13.579 --> 23:16.266
You didn't just go to
her room to talk, did you?

23:16.386 --> 23:18.184
<i>You wanted to be prima ballerina</i>

23:18.201 --> 23:20.629
- so you killed her to make that happen.
- No.

23:20.655 --> 23:24.504
<i>Oh my God. What if I did?</i>

23:28.017 --> 23:29.992
And then you framed the man
you were having an affair with

23:30.009 --> 23:31.749
because you were afraid he would find out.

23:31.791 --> 23:34.404
- No!
- You can't lie to us.

23:34.690 --> 23:37.597
We're gonna prove that you
dragged her body into that river.

23:38.093 --> 23:39.715
No!

23:47.451 --> 23:50.959
I wouldn't... I wouldn't kill anyone.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.278
I didn't mean to hurt her, please.

23:53.311 --> 23:55.774
I didn't mean to hurt her.

23:55.894 --> 23:59.362
(crying)

24:02.799 --> 24:05.101
So Jewel and Natasha had
a fight in the dressing,

24:05.118 --> 24:07.168
that much we know. But if she killed her,

24:07.288 --> 24:08.781
I don't think it was premeditated.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.747
I mean she practically admitted to it.

24:10.781 --> 24:14.420
Eh, I believe her when
she said she isn't sure,

24:14.540 --> 24:17.303
and when you asked her if she
dumped the body in the river,

24:17.328 --> 24:20.210
I saw confusion and surprise on her face.

24:20.330 --> 24:22.017
You think someone else moved the body?

24:22.059 --> 24:24.268
Well, let's look at the
time frame here. I mean,

24:24.319 --> 24:26.125
let's say it's true that Natasha and Micah

24:26.142 --> 24:27.739
<i>had a rendez-vous that afternoon.</i>

24:27.764 --> 24:31.193
Did she drive up North to dump
the body before or after that?

24:31.313 --> 24:33.268
See I don't think she had
enough time to do it all

24:33.294 --> 24:34.924
and get back for rehearsals.

24:35.044 --> 24:38.336
- Ok, so we keep looking.
- She's our prime suspect right now.

24:38.378 --> 24:40.278
Yeah, I know, we keep
her. But Toby's right.

24:40.286 --> 24:41.488
We're gonna need more.

24:44.588 --> 24:45.647
Ok.

24:45.672 --> 24:47.367
But you're running out of time.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.235
Since your girlfriend's
story was published,

24:49.269 --> 24:50.520
the phone's been ringing off the hook.

24:50.554 --> 24:52.251
Everyone's screaming for a statement.

24:52.885 --> 24:55.015
Can only hold them off so long.

24:55.016 --> 24:56.671
We're on it.

24:58.806 --> 25:02.301
Ok, so what did you see exactly?

25:02.335 --> 25:04.537
I saw a fight in the dressing
room. Jewel went down,

25:04.553 --> 25:05.948
looked like she wasn't moving.

25:05.990 --> 25:07.117
You think she killed her?

25:07.142 --> 25:09.738
I don't know. I saw Natasha
running out of there and...

25:10.091 --> 25:12.713
you know, as for the park, I
don't think Natasha was there.

25:12.833 --> 25:15.887
Ok well the boot casts
take Micah off the table.

25:16.251 --> 25:18.822
Now without him or Natasha,
who does that leave us with?

25:18.839 --> 25:21.360
Another person in the
park weighing under 120lbs.

25:21.377 --> 25:23.797
I think we need to speak to
everyone in that troop again.

25:24.444 --> 25:25.990
When Jewel contacted Tia,

25:26.007 --> 25:27.713
she mentioned something
about corruption, right?

25:27.722 --> 25:29.233
Maybe this goes back to the company.

25:29.243 --> 25:29.997
Yeah.

25:30.117 --> 25:31.545
- I'll speak to Tia.
- Ok.

25:35.931 --> 25:37.033
<i>(Adam): Look Mich,</i>

25:37.153 --> 25:40.335
she's lifting her head for
the first time. Miss you.

25:45.638 --> 25:47.837
Hey. How was your day?

25:48.284 --> 25:50.528
It was ok. What about you? Any,

25:50.721 --> 25:53.828
- any breaks?
- Ah, look.

25:53.948 --> 25:55.795
I know that you brought us the case

25:55.803 --> 25:58.543
and that you have a job to
do just like the rest of us.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.324
But you can't tell me
anything about the case,

26:00.366 --> 26:01.517
I know the drill.

26:01.637 --> 26:04.400
That doesn't mean you can't
tell me if you know something.

26:05.459 --> 26:07.946
Honey, if you want intel
from me, it's gonna cost you.

26:07.980 --> 26:09.526
Honey, are you extorting me?

26:09.560 --> 26:12.467
Well, this is what you get when
you mix business with pleasure babe.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.820
- What do you want?
- An exclusive.

26:14.940 --> 26:15.719
Done.

26:15.839 --> 26:17.862
Only after the case is solved.

26:19.282 --> 26:20.206
Deal.

26:20.475 --> 26:23.879
Ok, I got something. I went
to see Susan Gollnow today.

26:23.929 --> 26:25.845
- The head of the board.
- Mmhm.

26:26.114 --> 26:28.383
It was the way she spoke about Jewel.

26:28.669 --> 26:30.820
Like, she seemed to imply she was dirty.

26:30.940 --> 26:33.274
I don't know but, maybe
you'd want to read her.

26:33.308 --> 26:35.299
'Cause she's definitely hiding something.

26:35.324 --> 26:36.887
That's a good tip.

26:37.089 --> 26:39.190
- Thank you.
- Don't forget.

26:39.310 --> 26:42.156
- Quid pro quo.
- You will get the exclusive.

26:42.871 --> 26:44.359
Good.

26:48.963 --> 26:50.930
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

26:50.955 --> 26:52.576
Ah! No, no problem.

26:52.585 --> 26:53.602
Please sit down.

26:53.652 --> 26:56.257
I just have a few more
questions about Jewel.

26:56.377 --> 26:58.593
There's really nothing I
haven't already told the police.

26:58.635 --> 27:01.476
Well you see, I'm more curious
about your relationship with her.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.278
- Our relationship?
- Mmhm.

27:05.426 --> 27:06.627
Couldn't have been better.

27:06.648 --> 27:09.242
<i>Unless you count the fact
she made my life hell.</i>

27:10.485 --> 27:14.267
See, 'cause I heard that
there's some animosity

27:14.293 --> 27:15.444
between the two of you.

27:15.754 --> 27:18.771
What? Don't believe
everything you hear, Mr. Logan.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.687
Dancers like to talk.

27:22.191 --> 27:24.948
Jewel was a kind, compassionate person.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.536
See that's not consistent
with what I've been told.

27:30.729 --> 27:32.401
I'm not sure what to tell you,

27:32.418 --> 27:33.788
she was loved by everyone.

27:35.603 --> 27:36.843
You get Alya out,

27:36.911 --> 27:40.141
or I'll have you kicked
off the board immediately.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.007
Goodnight!

27:45.965 --> 27:48.477
Then I guess my
information about Alya King,

27:48.597 --> 27:50.326
her best friend, is wrong.

27:50.721 --> 27:52.048
Alya?

27:52.199 --> 27:53.493
What did you hear about her?

27:53.613 --> 27:55.972
Just that Jewel got her pushed out.

27:57.081 --> 27:59.476
No. Not true.

28:01.869 --> 28:04.753
Susan, I understand your hesitation.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.200
We're just trying to find
out what happened to Jewel.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.977
Everything helps.

28:16.650 --> 28:18.267
<i>Alya</i>

28:18.780 --> 28:21.032
had been prima ballerina

28:21.057 --> 28:22.603
for less than a year

28:22.898 --> 28:25.268
and then Jewel forced my hand.

28:25.388 --> 28:27.023
And you just listened to her?

28:27.259 --> 28:29.637
Jewel had the board of
directors in her pocket.

28:29.973 --> 28:32.039
She was going to have
me kicked off the board

28:32.081 --> 28:33.922
if I didn't agree to
make her the lead dancer.

28:34.291 --> 28:37.207
Was Alya aware that Jewel was behind it?

28:38.501 --> 28:41.014
I don't know, Mr. Logan.

28:41.611 --> 28:43.316
Maybe?

28:44.258 --> 28:45.677
Alya King.

28:45.896 --> 28:46.980
Maybe she found out

28:46.988 --> 28:50.064
<i>that Jewel got her removed as
prima ballerina and wanted revenge.</i>

28:50.064 --> 28:51.651
They were best friends, right?

28:51.652 --> 28:54.509
She probably had access
to her car, her home...

28:54.543 --> 28:56.946
Yeah, and guess who just
happens to own a cottage

28:56.980 --> 28:59.165
about 30 minutes away from where
we think the body was dumped?

28:59.450 --> 29:02.064
- Alya King.
- Let's go pick her up.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.475
- Did you find anything?
- Maybe.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.290
This looks pretty fresh. Is that rubber?

29:14.643 --> 29:16.122
Hm.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.631
(chuckles)

29:22.879 --> 29:24.895
It's probably the boot.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.803
What's this?

29:29.836 --> 29:32.778
It's a piece of fabric
from Jewel's costume.

29:35.139 --> 29:37.450
No. I, I know

29:37.467 --> 29:39.820
Jewel and she wouldn't push me out.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.324
It was all Micah, he's
the one who forced me out.

29:42.444 --> 29:44.475
But you still blamed Jewel, didn't you?

29:44.836 --> 29:46.189
No.

29:46.492 --> 29:48.928
We were best friends.

29:48.979 --> 29:51.130
<i>Yes, I was a little bit jealous. But</i>

29:51.180 --> 29:52.710
prima ballerinas come and go.

29:52.718 --> 29:54.760
I had my time and it was over.

29:57.077 --> 29:59.479
Do you spend much time at your cottage?

30:00.105 --> 30:03.549
Sure, it's been in my
family since I was a kid.

30:04.484 --> 30:06.248
What does my cottage
have to do with anything?

30:06.273 --> 30:08.004
We found traces of Jewel's blood

30:08.030 --> 30:10.743
and some of her clothing
burnt in your fireplace.

30:11.029 --> 30:12.458
What are you trying to say?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.248
Did you kill her?

30:15.643 --> 30:16.863
No!

30:16.930 --> 30:19.465
<i>Oh my God they think it's me.</i>

30:19.532 --> 30:21.626
Where were you that day, Alya?

30:21.987 --> 30:24.449
No one at the ballet saw you 'til 3pm.

30:24.483 --> 30:27.606
I w... , I w... , I was at home.

30:27.674 --> 30:29.609
Can anyone confirm that?

30:30.466 --> 30:31.466
No.

30:31.511 --> 30:34.273
<i>I never hurt her. Not ever.</i>

30:34.315 --> 30:36.534
I swear I didn't kill her.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.912
Ok.

30:44.777 --> 30:47.626
Alya is telling the truth,
she didn't kill Jewel.

30:48.442 --> 30:50.128
You're kidding me, right?

30:50.196 --> 30:52.063
She's got the motive.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.921
She's the right weight to make
those footprints in the snow.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.138
She's got no alibi

30:56.172 --> 30:59.743
and the boots and Jewel's clothes
were found burnt at her cottage.

30:59.752 --> 31:02.474
I understand how this looks. But
I've got a feeling that she didn't.

31:02.507 --> 31:04.482
Feelings don't convict criminals.

31:04.602 --> 31:06.256
Evidence does, Logan.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.542
And it's piled up against her.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.130
So make the arrest.

31:10.928 --> 31:12.374
Please.

31:23.945 --> 31:26.592
You know, Tia. I, I love
that our relationship

31:26.609 --> 31:29.037
has gotten to the point
where you feel just like,

31:29.045 --> 31:31.104
super comfortable just setting up shop here

31:31.146 --> 31:34.701
and using my gastro-pub
as your home office,

31:34.740 --> 31:37.231
but you look like you're with
the board of health or something.

31:37.248 --> 31:38.484
You know what I mean?

31:38.604 --> 31:39.752
I know, I'm sorry Oz.

31:39.778 --> 31:42.358
It's just, I'm just trying
to find a break in this story.

31:42.478 --> 31:45.132
She was convinced that the
ballet company was dirty

31:45.149 --> 31:46.535
but I haven't found anything.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.837
Ok well I can't really offer
you a break in the story,

31:48.846 --> 31:50.535
but how 'bout a break from the story?

31:50.543 --> 31:53.141
- Turkish appetizer platter on the house?
- I would love it.

31:53.191 --> 31:54.443
Yeah that's great, make that two.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.871
Hey! Ok but yours, you have to pay for,

31:56.879 --> 31:57.686
- I got bills.
- Whatever,

31:57.711 --> 31:59.753
- Pretty face discount, this one.
- It's fine.

32:00.123 --> 32:02.022
I heard you brought Alya King in.

32:02.527 --> 32:04.131
There's no way she's guilty.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.274
Ok I may not read minds,
but I can tell that

32:06.299 --> 32:07.888
this woman is not a killer.

32:08.008 --> 32:10.467
I know. I read her. She didn't do it.

32:10.942 --> 32:14.011
But without any hard evidence,
I can't convince Becker.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.980
Go back to Micah.

32:16.510 --> 32:19.716
All the research I've done,
it's all pointing towards him.

32:20.442 --> 32:22.694
I got a hold of Jewel's health records.

32:22.814 --> 32:24.888
As soon as Micah and Jewel were married,

32:24.922 --> 32:26.804
her trips to the hospital

32:26.812 --> 32:29.291
went from nonexistent to way too frequent.

32:29.411 --> 32:31.495
Broken fingers, black eye,

32:32.191 --> 32:34.662
she had a cracked rib on her honeymoon.

32:34.695 --> 32:36.485
Well that doesn't prove that he's a killer.

32:36.510 --> 32:38.871
Last month while on tour in Paris,

32:38.921 --> 32:40.300
he knocked her tooth out.

32:40.350 --> 32:41.829
Alya had to take

32:41.949 --> 32:44.039
Jewel to the hospital
for emergency dental work.

32:44.039 --> 32:46.957
Jewel claimed it was because
she had bitten into an apple.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.894
2am, she had bruising all over her neck.

32:49.931 --> 32:52.015
Really? Biting into an apple?

32:52.049 --> 32:53.435
Which tooth?

32:54.015 --> 32:56.746
You're missing the point. She
clearly didn't bite into an apple.

32:56.763 --> 32:59.074
No, Tia. Which tooth?

32:59.924 --> 33:02.023
Um...

33:02.057 --> 33:04.375
The front, top left one. Why?

33:04.495 --> 33:07.157
Hey, Michelle, meet me at the office.

33:07.175 --> 33:08.839
I think I know what happened to Jewel.

33:08.959 --> 33:10.629
Alright, see you there.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.284
Thank you.

33:13.679 --> 33:15.562
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

33:15.587 --> 33:17.621
Wait, did I just give you another tip?

33:26.377 --> 33:27.822
What is this?

33:28.024 --> 33:29.915
You knew Jewel was beaten.

33:30.973 --> 33:33.730
I didn't think it had anything
to do with her disappearing.

33:33.780 --> 33:36.587
You were there the night she got
her tooth knocked out in Paris.

33:36.612 --> 33:38.377
What are you saying?

33:39.192 --> 33:43.679
You stay away from her. It's ok, shh.

33:43.713 --> 33:45.814
We're going to get you to the hospital, ok?

33:47.343 --> 33:49.645
It was her front left tooth.

33:49.765 --> 33:52.233
This is also her front left tooth.

33:52.353 --> 33:55.115
We found this in the backseat
of her car out by the river.

33:55.235 --> 33:56.392
What?

33:57.678 --> 34:00.157
- What are you saying?
- Did you do something to her, Alya?

34:00.182 --> 34:01.687
No.

34:01.980 --> 34:04.569
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:05.780 --> 34:08.174
I can't take it anymore. He's killing me.

34:08.216 --> 34:09.838
I want to be free.

34:10.275 --> 34:13.242
You'd tell us if you knew what
happened to her, wouldn't you?

34:13.511 --> 34:14.940
Yes.

34:15.234 --> 34:16.679
'Course I would.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.116
Ha! Ha! Ha!

34:22.318 --> 34:23.705
Oh, I could live here forever.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.898
Oh, me too! Ha! Ha! Ha!

34:27.873 --> 34:29.369
Ok.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.058
We can't hold you any
longer. You're free to go.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.022
We'll be in touch.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.074
- Better be right about this, Logan.
- I am.

34:53.117 --> 34:55.301
Otherwise we just let a
possible murderer go free.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.620
I'm right.

34:56.739 --> 34:58.914
I know I am.

35:50.369 --> 35:52.033
Why?

35:54.916 --> 35:56.580
How did you find me?

35:57.201 --> 35:59.185
When I figured it out,

35:59.664 --> 36:01.160
what you had done,

36:02.463 --> 36:04.337
I knew you'd come here.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.657
- I, I didn't think you'd remember.
- Ha.

36:10.161 --> 36:12.741
Car broke down just over there, right?

36:13.362 --> 36:16.284
This is the B&B we had to stay
at while they fixed the engine.

36:18.695 --> 36:22.502
And you said "So this is
what freedom feels like."

36:23.015 --> 36:26.367
"To be in a place where nobody
knows or cares who you are."

36:27.358 --> 36:29.221
He was killing me, Lee.

36:29.930 --> 36:32.072
This would be my new beginning.

36:32.282 --> 36:34.560
I stay here until things quiet down

36:34.593 --> 36:36.602
until my face isn't in the news anymore.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.930
And then I make my way down south.

36:38.972 --> 36:40.594
Start my new life.

36:40.714 --> 36:42.115
But throw away everything?

36:42.123 --> 36:45.426
Your career? Your, your friends?

36:46.072 --> 36:48.056
Your entire life?

36:48.176 --> 36:50.199
It wasn't a life, Alya.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.846
So you frame Micah, Natasha,

36:54.966 --> 36:56.704
you even implicated me.

36:56.712 --> 36:58.519
They were never supposed
to suspect you, Lee.

36:58.553 --> 37:00.637
You went to my cottage
to hide the evidence.

37:00.670 --> 37:02.586
Of course they suspected me.

37:02.706 --> 37:05.267
I did what I had to do.

37:05.721 --> 37:07.141
Jewel,

37:08.057 --> 37:11.662
this is crazy. You're never
going to get away with this.

37:11.782 --> 37:13.628
Is that a threat?

37:13.964 --> 37:15.427
Are you going to try to stop me?

37:15.435 --> 37:18.561
Because I won't let you,
Alya. I've come too far.

37:18.681 --> 37:19.838
Hey!

37:20.233 --> 37:22.039
Jewel, stop right there.

37:22.159 --> 37:24.081
- It's over.
- There's nowhere to go.

37:24.098 --> 37:26.385
- We know everything.
- Ha.

37:26.872 --> 37:30.536
- You only know half the story.
- We know about the abuse.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.931
What Micah did to you was horrible,

37:32.956 --> 37:35.233
but there are other
things you could've done.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.376
Like what? Call the police?

37:38.496 --> 37:40.645
He would've sat in jail for a night.

37:40.765 --> 37:43.486
No. He needs to suffer

37:43.519 --> 37:45.990
for what he did to me. For every slap,

37:46.110 --> 37:48.461
- every punch.
- Jewel, I'm so sorry.

37:48.486 --> 37:50.763
- I should have done someth...
- Look what you have done.

37:52.150 --> 37:54.243
No one can help me.

37:54.363 --> 37:57.092
- Whoa.
- Jewel, drop the gun.

37:58.562 --> 38:01.344
You know I bought this to use on Micah.

38:01.974 --> 38:04.848
Jewel, don't do it. Don't
throw your life away.

38:05.427 --> 38:07.915
It's too late. It's too late.

38:07.932 --> 38:09.332
No, no, no. It's not too late.

38:09.344 --> 38:11.831
- It's never too late.
- I've lost everything.

38:11.882 --> 38:12.949
You haven't lost, Jewel.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.496
But if you pull that trigger, Micah wins.

38:15.616 --> 38:17.193
He's not worth it.

38:18.243 --> 38:21.197
You can't let him get away
with what he's done to you.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.934
Put the gun down.

38:27.917 --> 38:30.270
- It's gonna be ok.
- Put the gun down.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.031
So what is that now?

38:47.151 --> 38:49.252
Adultery, innocence, guilt.

38:49.372 --> 38:52.026
Man there's no limit to what you
can read in someone's face, is there?

38:52.791 --> 38:54.959
So what's going to happen to Jewel now?

38:54.959 --> 38:57.387
Well, she's looking at
doing time, that's for sure.

38:57.507 --> 38:58.816
Framing someone for murder

38:58.816 --> 39:00.707
is not your run-of-the-mill fraudulent act.

39:00.827 --> 39:03.354
Well she was in a desperate situation.

39:03.690 --> 39:05.926
I'm sure the courts will take
that situation into account.

39:05.951 --> 39:06.850
Mmhm.

39:06.867 --> 39:09.573
I gave all of the files
about Micah's abuse to Metro,

39:09.598 --> 39:11.739
so he's not going to get off
that easy, either. (Beeping)

39:11.859 --> 39:13.748
Nicely done.

39:13.815 --> 39:15.884
Everyone.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.732
What's this? Everything ok?

39:20.782 --> 39:22.370
Yeah, it's just...

39:22.490 --> 39:26.009
Adam. He keeps sending
me these photos and videos

39:26.026 --> 39:29.236
of Carrie's big milestone moments.

39:29.564 --> 39:31.326
Makes me realize what I'm missing.

39:31.446 --> 39:33.464
So in your ideal, perfect world,

39:33.497 --> 39:36.522
Carrie would only have these
milestone moments on weekends?

39:36.571 --> 39:38.674
- Nights off?
- Exactly.

39:38.691 --> 39:40.623
Ok. Alright.

39:40.959 --> 39:43.060
Thanks for sitting down
with Tia, by the way.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.388
- It's a big story for her.
- 'Course.

39:47.312 --> 39:49.749
(gurgling from phone)

40:00.111 --> 40:01.758
(door closing)

40:07.959 --> 40:09.513
Hi.

40:09.633 --> 40:13.648
- Hey.
- Hey. Didn't hear you come in.

40:14.968 --> 40:16.909
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

40:17.029 --> 40:19.044
Hey, did you get my texts?

40:19.164 --> 40:21.851
I did, yeah.

40:23.297 --> 40:24.869
Um, I need to ask you something.

40:24.911 --> 40:28.247
And I think it's going to
sound silly and selfish, but...

40:28.919 --> 40:30.689
Ok.

40:31.415 --> 40:34.767
Can you stop sending me photos and videos

40:34.794 --> 40:36.439
of Carrie's big moments?

40:36.456 --> 40:39.205
The little stuff and the cute
stuff, that's totally fine.

40:39.222 --> 40:42.398
But the big moments, not so fine.

40:43.003 --> 40:45.130
Just thought you'd want to
see it when it was happening.

40:45.172 --> 40:47.693
I know, I know I'm going
to miss out on some of

40:47.735 --> 40:49.886
her big moments, but seeing it

40:49.903 --> 40:52.886
all on my cellphone for
the first time it just,

40:53.847 --> 40:55.996
you know, kinda breaks my heart.

40:56.116 --> 40:58.728
So maybe when I get home,

40:58.848 --> 41:01.417
I can see it for the first time then.

41:01.468 --> 41:03.518
- Hm.
- Is that ridiculous?

41:03.638 --> 41:04.837
No.

41:05.510 --> 41:06.804
I get it.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.938
- You do?
- Come here.

41:12.611 --> 41:14.897
- I mean I should have known.
- No, no, no, no.

41:14.913 --> 41:17.577
It was a cry for help
and I never saw it coming.

41:17.586 --> 41:19.611
No one could have seen that coming, Tia.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.022
But I should have done my research,
maybe I could have helped her.

41:22.048 --> 41:23.535
Look, she was using you.

41:23.569 --> 41:26.401
Your interview was a part
of her plan to frame Micah.

41:26.594 --> 41:27.931
I just can't,

41:28.141 --> 41:32.746
can't imagine what state of mind she
would have been in to do what she did.

41:33.051 --> 41:34.712
Did you file your story?

41:35.250 --> 41:37.035
My editor already called.

41:37.039 --> 41:38.846
- AP is picking up the story.
- Hey!

41:38.966 --> 41:40.619
Cheers to you. Cheers to that.

41:40.653 --> 41:43.107
<i>Cheers to you for getting me the exclusive.</i>

41:43.116 --> 41:45.502
Mmm. Quid pro quo, right?

41:45.520 --> 41:46.872
We make a pretty good team.

41:46.906 --> 41:48.755
We should do it more
often, don't you think?

41:48.957 --> 41:50.041
Nope.

41:50.161 --> 41:51.982
Don't think. Bad idea.

41:52.208 --> 41:54.461
Working with an
ex-girlfriend or girlfriend?

41:54.486 --> 41:55.839
Not advisable.

41:55.864 --> 41:57.990
You're gonna get your love of
feet back in no time, buddy.

41:58.110 --> 42:00.218
Time shmime. Hey Anastasia.

42:00.243 --> 42:03.024
- No, I'm taking action my friend.
- What'd you do?

42:03.144 --> 42:04.637
- What did I do?
- Yeah.

42:04.671 --> 42:06.898
I took a 6 month leave of
absence from the hospital.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.158
Plunging all my energy into this place.

42:09.278 --> 42:10.662
You serious?

42:11.234 --> 42:13.251
I could not be seriouser, my friend.

42:13.371 --> 42:15.327
- More serious.
- Exactly.

42:15.369 --> 42:18.294
This way I don't have to
see Sandy, it's a win-win.

42:18.311 --> 42:20.537
Well, here's to doing what we love.

42:22.386 --> 42:24.672
<i>(Toby): Natasha? Is that who it was?</i>

42:26.100 --> 42:28.320
<i>(Micah): Where did that come from?</i>

42:28.681 --> 42:30.530
(rewinding)

42:30.650 --> 42:33.361
<i>(Toby): Natasha? Is that who it was?</i>

42:33.765 --> 42:35.991
<i>(Micah): Where did that come from?</i>

42:36.111 --> 42:38.084
(rewinding)

42:38.748 --> 42:40.739
<i>(Toby): Natasha? Is that who it was?</i>

42:41.865 --> 42:43.781
<i>(Micah): Where did that come from?</i>

42:44.167 --> 42:46.293
How the hell does he know that?
