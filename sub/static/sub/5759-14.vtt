Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'I'I'LE LIARS.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.067
WATCH ME MAKE
A GIRL DISAPPEAR.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.067
KISSES, A.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.067
WHERE'S EMILY?

00:07.100 --> 00:08.761
HURRY UP!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.438
TWO OF THEM?

00:10.470 --> 00:13.007
( grunting )

00:14.480 --> 00:15.708
HELP ME!

00:15.740 --> 00:17.549
( screaming )
CECE!

00:19.150 --> 00:20.777
THIS IS WHAT ALI
WANTED US TO SEE.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.084
THERE ARE TWO PAYMENTS
MADE TO CECE DRAKE LAST WEEK.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.678
MAYBE A PAID HER
TO DRESS UP AS RED COAT.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.278
I THINK A IS A GUY.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.652
IT'S LOOK LIKE HE'S FOLLOWED
HER TRAIL TO RAVENSWOOD.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.658
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU
GUYS BEING THERE ALONE.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.590
I'M NOT WAITING FOR TOBY.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.326
YOU NEED TO LEAVE
RAVENSWOOD.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.625
YOU'RE BEING WATCHED.
HE'S HOPING YOU'LL
LEAD HIM TO ALISON.

00:38.670 --> 00:39.796
ALI'S STILL ALIVE?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.400
WE'RE CRASHING A PARTY.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.560
( heavy breathing )

00:48.240 --> 00:50.344
**

00:59.560 --> 01:02.427
Hanna:
WHAT KIND OF TOWN THROWS
A PARTY IN A GRAVEYARD?

01:02.460 --> 01:04.553
Emily:
MUST BE TO HONOR THEIR DEAD.

01:04.590 --> 01:07.457
YEAH, THEY CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT WALKING ALL OVER THEM?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.492
GUYS, WHAT IF WE SEE A
BEFORE WE FIND ALISON?

01:10.530 --> 01:12.691
THERE'S FOUR OF US
THERE'S ONLY ONE OF HIM.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.391
UM, YEAH, BUT THAT HIM MIGHT
BE CARRYING A WEAPON.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.136
ALL WE'VE GOT ARE TH ESE
20-POUND HATS.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.671
WELL, I CAN'T RUN
FROM THE ENEMY.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.678
THIS GIRDLE IS CUTTING
OFF MY AIR SUPPLY.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.302
IT'S A CORSET.
IT'S TORTURE.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.147
PEOPLE REALLY WORE
THIS CRAP?

01:25.180 --> 01:26.841
I'M NEVER COMPLAINING
AGAIN ABOUT A SPORTS BRA.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.848
( exhaling sharply)

01:32.290 --> 01:33.882
WAIT.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.410
I CAN'T DO THIS.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.883
EMILY? WE HAVE TO GET
TO ALISON BEFORE A DOES.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.192
WE CAN'T BACK OFF.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.494
IT'S NOT JUST A
I'M SCARED OF.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.521
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
READY TO SEE ALISON.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.562
EM, WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.231
COME ON.

02:25.570 --> 02:28.698
MAN, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CROAKING
IN THIS TOWN A LONG TIME.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.276
IT HAPPENS.

02:31.650 --> 02:34.539
WHAT ARE THOSE?
ARE THOSE FINGERS?

02:34.580 --> 02:38.414
THEY'RE MUSHROOMS.
ARIA, GET A GRIP.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.887
( laughing and voices
in distance )

02:44.590 --> 02:45.852
HAN NA?

02:45.890 --> 02:47.699
HEY, STAY WITH US.

02:55.770 --> 02:56.964
( phone ringing )

02:57.010 --> 02:58.932
WAIT, HOLD ON.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.574
WAIT, IT'S EZRA.
HE MIGHT BE WORRIED
ABOUT ME.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.271
JUST DON'T TELL HIM
TOO MUCH.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.508
HEY, THERE.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.643
HEY. I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU. WHERE ARE YOU?

03:07.680 --> 03:11.548
UH, LOOK, IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A GREAT TIME TO TALK.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.808
I'M STANDING IN A GRAVEYARD.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.282
Ezra:
YOU'RE WHAT?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.958
I'M IN RAVENSWOOD.
BUT I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
OKAY?

03:16.990 --> 03:19.299
ARIA?
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.924
YEAH, I WILL.
I PROMISE. BYE.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.609
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP *

03:38.950 --> 03:41.373
* IT'S WHERE THIS ONE
YOU SAVE *

03:41.420 --> 03:43.718
* GOT A LOCKET,
IN YOUR POCKET *

03:43.750 --> 03:46.583
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

03:46.620 --> 03:48.713
* EVER SHOW YOU
THAT I KNOW YOU *

03:48.760 --> 03:51.320
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:51.360 --> 03:53.954
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

03:54.000 --> 03:56.525
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:04.310 --> 04:10.601
HEY.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.901
GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

04:11.950 --> 04:14.316
GUM? MINT?
COUGH DROP?

04:14.350 --> 04:16.011
NO.

04:16.050 --> 04:19.679
I MEAN, I DO.
IN MY CAR.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.359
YOU HAVE A CAR?
WHY ARE YOU ON THE BUS?

04:23.990 --> 04:26.356
WHY ARE YOU SITTING
NEXT TO ME?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.992
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
STANDING ROOM ONLY.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.918
WELL, WHEN I GOT ON,
I WENT TO THE BACK.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.996
BUT THE DUDE IN ROW 26
WAS CREEPING ME OUT.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.065
SO, I TRIED SITTING
NEXT TO THE DRIVER,

04:35.100 --> 04:37.898
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FOOD AND I'M STARVING.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.704
SORRY. I DIDN'T
PACK A PICNIC.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.300
I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO BE ON THIS BUS.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.547
YEAH, ME NEITHER.
I HAD TO CHANGE IN HARRISBURG.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.548
THIS FREAK ON THE LAST ONE
WAS SO ANNOYING.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.684
KEPT TELLING ME HE LOOKED
LIKE RYAN GOSLING

04:50.720 --> 04:52.085
IN CERTAIN LIGHT.
AND I'M LIKE,

04:52.120 --> 04:53.849
"DUDE, CARRY THAT
LIGHT WITH YOU,

04:53.890 --> 04:56.085
BECAUSE IN THIS LIGHT,
YOU LOOK LIKE SHREK."

04:56.120 --> 04:58.486
SO,
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.054
RAVENSWOOD.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.024
OH. ME, TOO.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.789
YOU GOT FRIENDS THERE?

05:05.830 --> 05:08.390
NO, UM, FAMILY.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.830
BUT I HAVEN'T MET THEM--
HIM--YET.

05:11.870 --> 05:15.772
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY UNCLE
EXISTED UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.678
YOUR PARENTS NEVER--

05:19.720 --> 05:21.312
THEY'RE GONE.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.008
GONE?

05:24.050 --> 05:25.312
DEAD.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.119
SO, THE CREEP
IN 26 FELL ASLEEP

05:28.160 --> 05:29.582
AND HE HAS A HUGE
BAG OF CHIPS.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.359
DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET
AWAY WITH STEALING THEM?

05:32.660 --> 05:36.027
UH, WELL, UNLESS 60 PEOPLE
GET ON AT THE NEXT STOP...

05:36.060 --> 05:38.790
I'D SAY WE LOOK
PRETTY GOOD FOR IT.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.695
YEAH.

05:41.870 --> 05:45.704
SO, DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE COMING?
YOUR UNCLE?

05:45.740 --> 05:47.435
YEAH, OF COURSE HE DOES.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.801
HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I HAVE.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.909
SO, THEN, WHO'RE YOU
LIVING WITH NOW?

05:51.950 --> 05:54.009
IT'S COM PLICATED.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.109
FOSTER HOME?

05:58.150 --> 05:59.811
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
IT LIKE THAT.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.986
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CATCH SOMETHING BECAUSE

06:01.020 --> 06:02.829
WE'RE SHARING A SEAT.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.489
HEY, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
TO CATCH, I'VE ALREADY GOT IT.

06:06.530 --> 06:10.591
I'VE SPENT SOME TIME
IN A FEW OF THEM MYSELF.

06:10.630 --> 06:14.498
SO, UM, ARE YOU
RUNNING AWAY?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.962
I'M STEALING THOSE CHIPS.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.713
WHY WOULD ALI COME
TO THIS PARTY LIKE THIS?

06:27.750 --> 06:28.774
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE
IT HAS SOMETHING

06:28.820 --> 06:30.185
TO DO WITH MRS. GRUNWALD.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.518
YOU GUYS, LOOK.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.788
RIGHT OVER THERE.
DO YOU SEE HIM?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.014
SEE WHO?

06:35.060 --> 06:37.153
Spencer:
THE DUDE STANDING BY HIMSELF.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.158
HE'S WEARING THAT
VINTAGE UNIFORM.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.919
HAN NA, DON'T STARE!

06:40.960 --> 06:42.461
DO YOU WANT ME
TO LOOK OR NOT?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.060
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT BOARD SHORTS?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.499
Emily:
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.496
WE GO UP THERE AND ASK
THE SCUMBAG IF HE'S A.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.507
All:
HANNA!

06:49.540 --> 06:51.633
WHAT? IT'S CRAZY.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.171
WE'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN HIM BEFORE.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.428
WHY WOULD A TOTAL
STRANGER BE AFTER US?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.902
WHO KNOWS IF HE'S
A STRANGER TO ALISON?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.168
OR MONA? OR JENNA?
OR MELISSA?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.939
HE'S NOT ALONE ANYMORE.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.588
Spencer: YOU GUYS STAY HERE.
I WAN NA HEAR WHAT

07:04.620 --> 07:06.508
THEY'RE SAYING.
KEEP LOOKING FOR ALI.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.788
OKAY.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.050
NAM ES?

07:17.970 --> 07:20.530
IF THAT'S THE CREEP
WHO'S BEEN MESSING WITH
ALI AND THE REST OF US,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.629
WE NEED ANSWERS.
LET'S GO TALK TO HER.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.227
( gasps )

07:43.260 --> 07:44.522
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:44.560 --> 07:47.199
W-WE THOUGHT WE'D TRY
AND FIND OTHER PEOPLE
IN TOWN WHO MIGHT'VE

07:47.230 --> 07:49.528
HAD CONTACT WITH ALI,
OR--
OR WHAT?

07:49.570 --> 07:53.631
YOU NEED TO LEAVE. NOW.
ALL OF YOU.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.762
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:31.810 --> 08:33.107
HE'S A LIGHT SLEEPER.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.712
( sound of twigs snapping
and leaves rustling )

08:58.130 --> 08:59.666
( screaming )

08:59.700 --> 09:02.294
HANNA, WHY AREN'T YOU
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

09:02.340 --> 09:04.763
CALL ME, PLEASE.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.608
WHO'S HAN NA?

09:09.650 --> 09:10.947
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.310
YOU GUYS HAD
SOME KIND OF FIGHT?

09:14.350 --> 09:16.648
NO. I'M...

09:16.690 --> 09:20.786
ANGRY AT MYSELF BECAUSE
I LET HER GO THERE.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.117
GO WHERE?

09:22.160 --> 09:23.650
RAVENSWOOD.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.988
YOU WORRIED SHE'S HOOKING
UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

09:27.230 --> 09:29.926
NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.764
WELL, HEY,
DON'T SWEAT IT.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.961
IF WE GET THERE AND BOTH
GET KICKED TO THE CURB,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.966
WE MEET ON
THE NEXT BUS OUT.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.271
DOES YOUR UNCLE KNOW
YOU'RE COMING?

09:44.180 --> 09:46.273
DID YOU AT LEAST
GIVE HIM A HEADS UP?

09:46.310 --> 09:49.347
WHY? SO HE COULD
SLAM THE DOOR SHUT
BEFORE HE EVEN OPENS IT?

09:51.720 --> 09:54.382
I JUST...
HE MIGHT WANT SOME--

09:54.420 --> 09:57.218
LOOK, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, OKAY?

09:57.260 --> 10:01.026
I HAVE OTHER PLACES TO GO.
JUST WORRY ABOUT HANNA.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.694
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.628
OH, I THINK SO.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.906
DID SOMEBODY PUSH
YOU IN THERE?

10:11.940 --> 10:13.908
THAT GUY THAT
GRABBED YOU INSIDE,
DID HE PUSH YOU IN--

10:13.940 --> 10:15.373
NO. THAT WAS MY COUSIN.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.004
HE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO'S BEHIND THIS.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.074
Man:
LEAH!

10:19.110 --> 10:21.374
WAS IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

10:21.420 --> 10:25.208
SHE FELL. I GUESS.
I WAS JUST HELPING HER OUT.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.239
YOU FELL?

10:26.290 --> 10:27.882
I TOLD YOU
IT WASN'T SAFE HERE.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.293
THANKS, AGAIN.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.393
HOW COULD YOU LOSE
BOTH OF THEM?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.738
I TOLD YOU, I GOT JUMPED
BY MRS. GRUNWALD.

10:42.770 --> 10:43.737
( snapping noise )

10:43.770 --> 10:45.863
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

10:45.910 --> 10:46.877
HEY.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.104
HEY?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:48.140 --> 10:49.698
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE RIGHT BEHIND ME.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.047
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BEHIND ME.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.877
WELL, I WAS BEHIND
TWO LITTLE GIRLS
WHO WERE FREAKING ME OUT.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.239
I STILL HAVEN'T
SEEN THEIR FACES.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.441
CAN WE PLEASE GO BACK
TO THE TENT?

10:56.480 --> 10:59.756
GUYS, I DON'T THINK SCARY
UNIFORM IS BOARD SHORTS.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.280
THAT'S NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND,
THAT'S HIS COUSIN.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.880
THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUSLY
WEIRD GOING ON IN THIS TOWN.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.354
UH, GEE, YOU THINK? THEY'RE
USING HEADSTONES FOR BARSTOOLS.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.322
WHY WERE THEY
WEARING RED COATS?
WHO?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.896
THOSE TWINS.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.034
WHY DO WE CARE? WE'RE HERE
TO FIND ALISON, REMEMBER?

11:13.070 --> 11:14.958
ALI'S WAS THE ONE
WHO TOLD US ABOUT
THAT BLONDE TWIN

11:15.000 --> 11:16.365
WHO STABBED HER SISTER--

11:16.400 --> 11:18.834
CAN WE NOT TELL GHOST
STORIES WHILE WE'RE WALKING
THROUGH A GRAVEYARD?

11:18.870 --> 11:20.098
( gasping )

11:20.140 --> 11:22.199
Spencer:
IS THAT ALI?

11:35.060 --> 11:37.449
WHERE DID SHE GO?
YOU SAW HER, RIGHT?

11:37.490 --> 11:40.095
YEAH, WE ALL DID.
WELL, THEN, WHERE IS SHE?

11:47.870 --> 11:51.806
OKAY, I DON'T GET IT.
WE WERE, WHAT, LIKE
TEN SECONDS BEHIND HER?

11:51.840 --> 11:54.400
HOW DID A GET HER OUT
OF HERE WITHOUT US SEEING IT?

11:54.440 --> 11:56.749
I'M OFFICIALLY LOSING
THIS FLYING SAUCER.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.771
GUYS, LOOK.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.038
THERE'S NO LEAVES THERE.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.715
Hanna:
YEAH.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.956
( stone grinding )

12:30.810 --> 12:33.415
WHERE DOES THIS EVEN GO?

12:33.450 --> 12:36.988
UM... HELL?
JUST A GUESS.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.550
WHO DID THAT?

12:41.590 --> 12:43.251
( grunting )

12:43.290 --> 12:45.781
( knocking )
COME ON,
WE'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.127
HOW?

12:47.160 --> 12:48.388
THIS HAS GOT
TO LEAD SOMEWHERE.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.227
WELL, HOPEFULLY IT
LEADS TO YOUR CAR.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.225
SPENCE,
I WANT TO GO HOME.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.090
OKAY, BREATHE.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.493
Spencer:
WE'LL FIND ANOTHER DOOR.

13:06.150 --> 13:08.015
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE A SIGNAL?

13:08.050 --> 13:10.917
NO. I HAVE
MINUS THREE BARS.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.415
Hanna:
HOW OLD IS THIS PLACE?

13:16.460 --> 13:18.018
( wind blowing )

13:18.060 --> 13:19.925
WHERE'S THAT
WIND COMING FROM?

13:21.930 --> 13:24.899
THERE MUST BE AN
OPEN DOOR SOMEWHERE
KEEP WALKING.

13:24.930 --> 13:29.139
Aria:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:29.170 --> 13:31.035
HOLD ON!
GET AGAINST THE WALL!

13:31.070 --> 13:32.606
( gruntin
OW! g )

13:32.640 --> 13:33.971
HOLD ON,
HOLD ON TO ME.

13:36.910 --> 13:39.049
WHAT IS THAT?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.547
GOD, OW!

13:43.220 --> 13:46.917
( panting )

13:46.960 --> 13:49.019
( wind dies down )

13:56.330 --> 13:57.558
HANNA, ARE YOU--
AH!

14:00.200 --> 14:01.599
Spencer:
WHERE'S HANNA?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.302
SHE WAS RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
WASN'T SHE?

14:04.340 --> 14:06.467
Spencer:
HANNA? HANNA?

14:06.510 --> 14:08.137
WHERE DID SHE GO?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.539
HAN NA?

14:22.660 --> 14:24.924
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.225
I WAS JUST ASKING
ABOUT YOUR UNCLE BECAUSE...

14:29.300 --> 14:30.289
I'VE BEEN THERE.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.628
YOU CRASH INTO SOMEBODY'S
LIFE LIKE A CANNONBALL,

14:32.670 --> 14:34.467
AND THERE MIGHT
BE AN EXPLOSION.

14:37.270 --> 14:38.669
I'VE GOT AN UNCLE, TOO,

14:38.710 --> 14:41.406
WHO TURNED OUT
TO BE MY FATHER.

14:44.250 --> 14:48.016
ARE YOU LIVING
WITH 'I'VIC'J/I NOW?

14:49.650 --> 14:53.950
YOU KNOW, AND IF THAT
IS WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING,
DON'T.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.651
OKAY, GET THE PICKET
FENCE AND THE BEDROOM

14:55.690 --> 14:59.956
WITH YOUR OWN DOOR
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.561
I'D SETTLE FOR SOMEONE
WHO WOULDN'T TOSS MY LAPTOP
INTO A STEAMING BATHTUB.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.522
WERE YOU IN IT?

15:05.570 --> 15:08.994
NO. NOT THAT SHE
WOULD'VE NOTICED.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.305
SHE'S THE KIND WHO OPENS
A BOTTLE OF VODKA
AND TH ROWS AWAY THE CAP.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.329
WELL, THEN THIS WAS
A GOOD CALL.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.545
MAYBE THINGS'LL WORK OUT.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.117
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

15:22.150 --> 15:24.539
YEAH. BACK TO SCRANTON.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.512
RATHER DEAL WITH
THE DEVIL I KNOW.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.420
HEY.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.690
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANNA DO THIS?

15:34.730 --> 15:37.028
I MEAN, YOU ARE
CLOSER TO RAVENSWOOD--

15:37.070 --> 15:38.219
LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.568
BUT HAVE A NICE LIFE.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.103
UM, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.538
CALEB.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.936
MIRANDA.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.105
BYE.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.427
ON SECOND THOUGHT.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.364
Hanna: EMILY!
GOD, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

16:14.370 --> 16:17.305
SPENCE, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:17.340 --> 16:19.035
HELLO?

16:22.810 --> 16:25.677
OH, MY GOD.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.185
( clanging sound )

16:41.160 --> 16:44.288
ALI?
ALI, IS THAT YOU?

16:44.330 --> 16:46.298
( bat flying by)

17:00.550 --> 17:02.711
( rats squeaking )

17:02.750 --> 17:04.149
( screaming )

17:05.150 --> 17:06.617
OH, MY GOD!

17:23.870 --> 17:25.667
( grunting )

17:25.710 --> 17:28.178
COME ON, COME ON.

17:29.410 --> 17:30.775
( grunting )

17:30.810 --> 17:33.244
( bells tinkling )

17:44.260 --> 17:46.387
( piano plays note )

18:02.540 --> 18:05.441
( heavy breathing )

18:10.720 --> 18:11.812
I'VE HEARD OF WHISTLING
PAST THE GRAVEYARD,

18:11.850 --> 18:14.410
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
COULD BRING A BAND.
( chuckles )

18:17.490 --> 18:20.721
GO AHEAD,
FIND YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
I'LL BE OKAY.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.853
YOU KNOW, I CAN WALK YOU
TO YOUR UNCLE'S HOUSE.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.822
THE DRIVER SAID THAT
IT WAS DOWN THAT STREET.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.863
NO, I CAN FIND IT MYSELF.
YOU'RE LATE.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.209
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'D RATHER FACE HIM ALONE.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.777
HOW I'M USED
TO DOING THINGS.
YEAH, WELL,

18:33.810 --> 18:36.574
YOU HAVE MY NUMBER,
SO...

18:36.610 --> 18:39.147
YOU'VE GOT MINE.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.340
LET ME KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.519
YEAH. PROMISE.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.851
WHAT WAS THAT?
KEEPS EVIL SPIRITS AWAY.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.824
NEVER HEARD THAT ONE.

18:50.860 --> 18:54.489
I JUST MADE IT UP.
( both laughing )

18:55.500 --> 18:57.161
SEE YOU 'ROUND
THE BUS STOP.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.236
RIGHT.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.374
( sighing )

19:13.480 --> 19:16.313
( whistling )

19:23.630 --> 19:26.428
( phone beeping )

19:32.730 --> 19:35.528
( clock ringing )
( gasping )

20:15.540 --> 20:17.747
( dial tone )

20:40.900 --> 20:43.403
HANNA! CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:43.440 --> 20:44.930
WHY DID YOU LET
GO OF HER?
I DIDN'T.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.528
I HELD ON TO HER
THE WHOLE TIME.

20:46.570 --> 20:47.571
UNTIL YOU
GRABBED A STATUE.

20:47.610 --> 20:48.838
GUYS, I DIDN'T
LET GO OF HER.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.609
EVEN IF SHE LET GO,
WHY WOULD SHE
JUST LEAVE LIKE THAT?

20:50.650 --> 20:51.901
SHE WOULDN'T.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.645
WHAT IS THAT?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.511
A HAS THE BOTH OF THEM,
DOESN'T HE?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.188
COME ON.

21:04.060 --> 21:07.791
( phone dialing )

21:12.500 --> 21:16.288
( high-pitched static )

21:16.340 --> 21:17.864
STUPID PHONE.

21:23.010 --> 21:25.808
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
THIS IS SERIOUSLY NOT HAPPENING.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.614
( creaking sound )

21:36.090 --> 21:38.388
Hanna:
OH,MYGOD.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.319
( footsteps approaching )

21:44.630 --> 21:46.461
( breathing rapidly)

21:46.500 --> 21:48.536
( footsteps approaching )

21:48.570 --> 21:50.765
OH, MY GOD.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.559
( phone ringing )

22:10.590 --> 22:12.421
HELLO?

22:12.460 --> 22:13.950
LISTEN, I NEED HELP...

22:14.000 --> 22:17.629
( old timey music playing )

22:25.110 --> 22:28.773
( music continues )

22:29.880 --> 22:32.940
( pounding )

22:33.980 --> 22:35.948
( door opening )

22:37.890 --> 22:40.415
HELLO?

23:24.670 --> 23:29.539
( children laughing )

23:36.040 --> 23:37.576
HAN NA?

23:39.510 --> 23:42.616
A DOOR IN A CRYPT THAT
LEADS TO A TUNNEL THAT
COMES UP INSIDE A MANSION.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.045
WHAT KIND OF ZONING LAWS
DOES THIS TOWN HAVE?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.910
IT COULD BE FROM
THE PROHIBITION,

23:47.960 --> 23:50.417
MAYBE EVEN
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.

23:54.630 --> 23:59.090
( liquid dripping )

23:59.130 --> 24:01.439
THAT'S JUST RUSTY WATER,
RIGHT?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.999
( distant screaming )

24:08.110 --> 24:10.135
Woman:
THEY'LL FIND OUT.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.774
MY FRIENDS KNOW I'M HERE.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.141
ALI?

24:19.190 --> 24:20.782
Aria:
WHERE DID SPENCER GO?

24:23.990 --> 24:26.823
( pounding sound )

24:29.000 --> 24:31.525
AH, COME ON!

24:37.740 --> 24:39.162
( distant banging )

24:46.680 --> 24:47.942
( boards creaking )

24:56.560 --> 24:58.585
ALI?

24:58.630 --> 24:59.756
( grunting )

25:25.650 --> 25:27.186
HELLO.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.709
HI.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.620
YOU LIVE HERE?
MY UNCLE DOES.

25:39.670 --> 25:40.591
OR, AT LEAST,
I THINK HE DOES.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.562
THAT'S WHO I WAS LOOKING
FOR WHEN I FOUND YOU.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.807
WHO ELSE LIVES
IN THIS HOUSE?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.899
WELL, THERE WERE PEOPLE
RUNNING IN THE HALL.
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THEM.

25:46.940 --> 25:50.137
THE ONLY PERSON I'VE
MET IN THIS HOUSE IS YOU.
AND YOU ARE?

25:50.180 --> 25:51.943
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?

25:51.980 --> 25:54.016
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO LET YOU OUT
OF THE PHONE BOOTH.

25:54.050 --> 25:56.814
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT THE ONE WHO LOCKED
ME IN THE PHONE BOOTH?

25:56.850 --> 25:58.784
YOU COULD BE FROM HERE,
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KILL ME.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.755
IF I WAS GOING TO KILL YOU,
I'D USE SOMETHING BETTER
THAN A PHONE BOOTH.

26:03.190 --> 26:05.158
MY NAME'S HANNA.

26:05.190 --> 26:08.296
HANNA. I'M MIRANDA.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.025
OKAY, THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND CRAZY,

26:10.060 --> 26:11.869
BUT I'VE GOT ONE FRIEND
IN THIS HOUSE

26:11.900 --> 26:13.026
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE
TRYING TO HURT HER.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.230
AND I'VE GOT SOME
OTHER FRIENDS WHO WERE

26:14.270 --> 26:15.589
TRYING TO SAVE
THE FIRST FRIEND,
BUT THEN WE ALL GOT

26:15.640 --> 26:18.336
SEPARATED IN THE TUNNEL
AND NOW I GOT LOCKED
IN A PHONE BOOTH.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.679
AND WHAT'S THE CRAZY PART?

26:20.710 --> 26:24.009
JUST LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE AND GO
FIND MY FRIENDS.
OKAY.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.948
YOU DO KNOW HOW
TO GET OUT OF HERE,
DON'T YOU?

26:27.980 --> 26:29.675
I MEAN, YOU GOT IN,
YOU CAME THROUGH A DOOR.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.110
I GOT A LITTLE LOST.
CAN'T WE JUST GET OUT
THE WAY YOU CAME IN?

26:33.150 --> 26:34.651
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

26:34.690 --> 26:37.989
WELL, I CAME THIS WAY.
I THINK.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.248
YOU ALWAYS DRESS LIKE
PROM NIGHT ON THE TITANIC?

26:44.430 --> 26:47.319
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS DID
YOU SAY YOUR UNCLE WAS IN?

26:47.370 --> 26:49.258
I DIDN'T.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.732
HENCHLY, TRUMBLE,
AND COLLINS.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.008
THAT'S MY UNCLE.
THE LAST ONE, COLLINS.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.679
COME ON.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.622
MIRANDA, COME ON.
NO WINDOW SHOPPING.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.869
DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
MIRANDA.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.844
NOT NOW.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.417
JUST KNOW,
YOU'LL BE SAFE.

27:37.450 --> 27:40.146
THAT'S WHAT YOUR
PARENTS WANTED.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.057
AND, PLEASE, FORGIVE ME.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.428
HEY.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.995
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.860
I THINK SO.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.901
I TOLD PEOPLE I WASN'T
AT MY PARENTS' FUNERAL

27:59.940 --> 28:02.977
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

28:03.010 --> 28:05.899
I GUESS I SAID IT SO OFTEN,
I STARTED BELIEVING IT MYSELF.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.679
BUT...

28:08.820 --> 28:11.084
I WAS THERE.

28:12.350 --> 28:15.080
AND I REMEMBER A MAN.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.951
I THINK
HE WAS MY UNCLE.

28:18.260 --> 28:21.093
BUT IF HE WAS THERE,
THEN WHY DID HE LEAVE ME?

28:23.030 --> 28:24.190
I DON'T KNOW.

28:25.970 --> 28:29.189
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE,
AND WE FIND HIM,

28:29.240 --> 28:32.960
AND I'LL HOLD HIM DOWN
WHILE YOU ASK HIM. DEAL?

28:33.010 --> 28:35.103
YEAH.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.000
COME ON.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.325
I TOLD YOU
I FELT FRESH AIR.

29:13.010 --> 29:15.774
Emily:
DO YOU REMEMBER
CLIMBING UP ANY STAIRS?

29:15.820 --> 29:17.242
I'M LUCKY I REMEMBER
HOW TO BREATHE.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.879
WE CAN CLIMB
DOWN THE TRELLIS.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.955
WHAT, AND JUST
LEAVE THEM HERE?

29:23.990 --> 29:26.026
NO, AND GET HELP.
LOTS OF HELP.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.084
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL PEOPLE?

29:27.130 --> 29:29.519
THAT A MANIAC HAS OUR DEAD
FRIEND WHO'S REALLY ALIVE,

29:29.560 --> 29:31.869
OR MAYBE WE COULD
COME UP WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE BELIEVABLE,

29:31.900 --> 29:33.527
LIKE WE'RE TRAPPED
IN A HAUNTED HOUSE?

29:33.570 --> 29:35.538
THINK OF A REALLY
GOOD LIE ON THE WAY DOWN.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.805
OKAY, I COULD ALMOST
JUMP FROM HERE.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.901
OKAY.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.168
( window creaking )
Aria: BE CAREFUL.

29:46.210 --> 29:49.008
( distant screaming )

29:49.050 --> 29:50.244
Woman:
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE!

29:51.450 --> 29:54.180
( gasping )

30:03.430 --> 30:05.364
HELLO?

30:07.170 --> 30:09.058
ALI?

30:19.980 --> 30:21.845
OW!

30:21.880 --> 30:23.575
HMM.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.188
( gasping )

30:31.630 --> 30:33.257
( heavy breathing )

30:36.530 --> 30:37.827
( grunting )

31:05.990 --> 31:08.356
( grunting )

31:28.980 --> 31:30.618
Caleb:
MIRANDA?

31:33.520 --> 31:36.455
FOR A GUY WHO'S
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY,
YOU'RE NOT EASY TO FIND.

31:36.490 --> 31:39.982
I DIDN'T KNOW
I NEEDED TO BE.
YOU OKAY?

31:40.030 --> 31:42.498
UM, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT ME AFTER.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.067
BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK
YOUR GIRL NEEDS A HUG.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.906
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL YOU.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.176
HAN NA,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

31:59.210 --> 32:02.270
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.515
I LOST THEM...

32:04.550 --> 32:07.383
AND I THINK A HAS ALI.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.227
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.454
SPENCER, WAKE UP.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.492
SPENCER.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.190
OH, MY GOD.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.530
A'S HERE!
IT'S OKAY, YOU'RE SAFE.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.106
ARE YOU OKAY?

32:25.140 --> 32:26.164
WHERE IS HE?

32:26.210 --> 32:28.132
( distant screaming )

32:29.480 --> 32:32.540
OKAY, I KNOW IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT,
BUT THIS IS A DOOR.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.539
WHY AM I DOING
THIS ALONE?

32:47.490 --> 32:50.323
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE
IN THE RICEEIF PLACE?

32:54.570 --> 32:57.038
MIRANDA? ARE YOU OKAY?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.702
Miranda:
THAT'S ME.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.055
Woman:
HELP ME!

33:18.090 --> 33:20.979
PLEASE.
HE'S GOING TO KILL ME!

33:26.400 --> 33:28.436
Woman ( on tape ):
HELP ME!

33:28.470 --> 33:30.461
PLEASE.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.539
( tape recorder stops )

33:33.570 --> 33:37.074
( door opening
and closing )

33:42.350 --> 33:44.443
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE IN HERE.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.155
YOU FOUND THE TUNNEL.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.290
WE FOLLOWED ALISON.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.366
SO, SHE WAS HERE.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.389
IS THIS--

34:00.430 --> 34:03.433
THE HOUSE IS MY HOME,
IT WILL NEVER BELONG TO ME.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.303
I'M MERELY ITS CARETAKER.

34:06.340 --> 34:10.538
AND THIS ROOM,
IT'S YOUR... OFFICE?

34:10.580 --> 34:14.641
A SPACE WITH NO
DISTRACTIONS OPENS
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.648
SO, THAT WAS ONE
OF YOUR SESSIONS.

34:16.680 --> 34:22.050
SIX MONTHS AGO,
THIS TAPE WAS STOLEN.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.321
WHAT IS IT?

34:27.860 --> 34:29.418
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

34:29.460 --> 34:31.826
IT'S NOT WHAT I SEE...

34:31.870 --> 34:33.724
IT'S WHAT I FEEL.

34:35.770 --> 34:39.160
ONE OF YOU HAS
BEEN TOUCHED

34:39.210 --> 34:44.341
BY THE ONE ALISON
FEARS THE MOST.

34:50.750 --> 34:53.639
Miranda:
I FOUND IT
IN MY UNCLE'S HOUSE.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.580
THERE HAS TO
BE SOME EXPLANATION.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.759
LIKE A BROTHER,
OR SOMETHING.

34:58.790 --> 35:00.678
IT SAID I HAD NO
LIVING RELATIVES.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.526
Hanna: YEAH.
YEAH, WE'LL MEET
YOU AT THE CAR.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.697
HANNA?
ARE THEY OKAY?

35:07.730 --> 35:13.100
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL OKAY,
BUT WE LOST ALI. AGAIN.

35:19.510 --> 35:20.545
( sighing )

35:20.580 --> 35:22.218
( air leaking out of tire )

35:22.250 --> 35:24.787
COULD THIS NIGHT
GET ANY WORSE?

35:24.820 --> 35:26.583
I'LL GET THE SPARE.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.350
ONE OF US KNOWS HOW
TO CHANGE A TIRE,
RIGHT?

35:30.520 --> 35:32.226
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
'CAUSE I'M GAY?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.423
NO. YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE
THE SPORTY ONE.

35:38.730 --> 35:42.769
SO, GUYS, I THINK
I'LL PEE'N8TF HERE.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.700
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE,
YOU CAN COME WITH US.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.300
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BRING HOME STRAYS?

35:47.340 --> 35:49.376
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

35:49.410 --> 35:52.447
THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.777
BEEN DOING IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

35:53.810 --> 35:56.370
CALEB,
HELP ME OUT HERE.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.445
YOU CAN'T LET HER GO
BACK IN THAT HOUSE.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.220
AND I HOPE YOU FIND
THE ONES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.598
COME ON, GUYS.
GET OUTTA HERE ALREADY.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.432
IT'S AN OPEN INVITATION.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.529
YOU CAN ALWAYS
COME TO ROSEWOOD.

36:20.570 --> 36:22.276
THANK YOU.

36:23.580 --> 36:24.706
BYE.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.416
GOD, I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD LET HER STAY HERE.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.810
YOU HEARD HER.
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WANTING ANSWERS,

36:37.860 --> 36:39.725
IT'S ABOUT
NEEDING THEM.

36:43.430 --> 36:45.364
DAMN IT.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.846
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

37:04.890 --> 37:08.018
FOR BEING THE KIND OF GUY
I CAN ASK TO STAY HERE

37:08.050 --> 37:10.359
AND TAKE CARE
OF A GIRL THAT PRETTY.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.448
ARE YOU SURE?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.853
YEAH.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.391
HELP HER GO
FIND HER UNCLE.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.967
THEN FIND ME
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.531
I LOVE YOU,
HANNA MARIN.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.586
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING,
ARE YOU?

37:42.620 --> 37:44.679
NOT TONIGHT.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.764
( distant voices
and laughing )

38:09.120 --> 38:11.941
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.083
THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN
OUT THE SPARE WHEN
MELISSIA AND I

38:14.120 --> 38:15.849
GOT INTO THAT ACCIDENT.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.848
WHERE'S CALEB?

38:19.890 --> 38:22.654
UH, HE'S TAKING
CARE OF A FRIEND.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.089
ALL RIGHT, WELL LET'S JUST
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE HAVE
TO DO TO GET OUT OF HERE,

38:25.130 --> 38:27.360
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO SPEND ANOTHER MINUTE
IN THIS TOWN.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.537
( car approaching )

38:32.010 --> 38:34.706
WHO IS THAT?

38:34.740 --> 38:36.799
( car doors opening )

38:42.620 --> 38:43.712
EZRA?

38:43.750 --> 38:45.547
I'VE BEEN CALLING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.911
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.
HEY.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.053
FLAT TIRE?

38:51.090 --> 38:53.650
YEAH, AND SHE DOESN'T
HAVE THE SPARE.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.794
WELL, IT'S LATE.
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU
GUYS A RIDE HOME?

38:55.830 --> 38:58.526
SOLD.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.128
WELL, COME ON, SPENCER.
WE'LL JUST SEND

39:00.170 --> 39:01.990
SOMEONE FOR YOUR
CAR TOMORROW, OKAY?

39:29.630 --> 39:31.154
( twigs breaking )

39:31.200 --> 39:33.566
ALISON?

40:01.030 --> 40:03.021
ALISON?

40:23.050 --> 40:25.143
DID YOU MISS ME?

40:32.230 --> 40:35.791
IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?
IN RAVENSWOOD.

40:37.830 --> 40:40.196
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.562
IT'S STILL NOT SAFE
FOR ME TO BE HERE.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.136
ALI, DON'T LEAVE AGAIN.

40:44.170 --> 40:48.209
LOOK, I WANNA COME HOME,
BUT YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.038
WHY?
WHO ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

40:52.510 --> 40:55.047
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL, HANNA?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.917
THAT WAS REALLY YOU?

41:06.990 --> 41:09.493
( shushes )

41:13.700 --> 41:15.793
ARIA?

41:26.780 --> 41:28.839
YOU FORGOT YOUR CELL PHONE.

41:48.330 --> 41:51.936
HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW
MANY KIDS ARE BURIED
IN THIS CEMETERY?

41:53.610 --> 41:56.738
CALEB?
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

41:56.780 --> 41:59.908
RIVERS.
WHY?
