WEBVTT

00:01.999 --> 00:05.998
 Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON "SURVIVOR": THIS SEASON--

00:05.998 --> 00:05.998
MEDICAL!

00:05.998 --> 00:08.999
HAS BEEN A TEST OF WILLS.

00:08.999 --> 00:10.833
 IT'S NOT EASY.

00:10.833 --> 00:11.999
 Jeff: WITH PERSEVERANCE, NEAL--

00:11.999 --> 00:12.999
 THE IDOL.

00:12.999 --> 00:14.999
 Jeff: TAI.

00:14.999 --> 00:15.708
 WHOA!

00:15.708 --> 00:19.998
 Jeff: AND JAISON, EACH FOUND AN IDOL.

00:19.998 --> 00:24.998
BUT SCOT WHO HAD TIES WITH TAI AND JAISON.

00:24.998 --> 00:26.998
 IT BECOMES SUPER IDOL.

00:26.998 --> 00:34.999
 Jeff: CHE CHA CHAN LOH TRIBE, THEY WERE TORN ON WHICH WAY TO

00:34.999 --> 00:34.999
GO.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
 DEBBIE WANTS US TO WORK WITH HER.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
 I DON'T THINK WE TRUST DEBBIE.

00:38.999 --> 00:44.999
 Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, GONDOL LOST.

00:44.999 --> 00:48.999
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, TAI, JULIA, AND SCOT HAD A PLAN TO

00:48.999 --> 00:53.999
GET RID OF PETER AND TRIED TO CONVINCE AUBRY TO GO ALONG.

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
 PETER IS USING YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
 Jeff: BUT AUBRY WAS CONFLICTED.

00:57.999 --> 01:01.000
 IF WE TAKE OUT PETER, THEY'RE GOING TO COME AFTER US NEXT.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.125
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, IT'S GOING PLOA BACK AN BITE ME IN THE ASS.

01:07.125 --> 01:11.417
 AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

01:11.417 --> 01:14.998
 ORIGINAL PLAN.

01:14.998 --> 01:18.998
 Jeff: AUBRY WAS STILL SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE VOTE SHE

01:18.998 --> 01:20.998
CHANGED HERS AT THE LAST SECOND.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.709
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT, PETER.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.998
PETER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

01:24.998 --> 01:26.998
AND NOW, EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR.

01:26.998 --> 01:28.834
11 ARE LEFT.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.998
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.998 --> 01:52.998
 WHY IS IT CONFUSING?

01:52.998 --> 01:53.998
WHAT'S THE ORIGINAL PLAN?

01:53.998 --> 01:56.709
THAT'S THE PROBLEM, YOU GUYS DON'T MAKE A DECISION AND STICK

01:56.709 --> 01:59.998
WITH IT, SO I WAS JUST CLEARING IT IT UP FOR JULIA.

01:59.998 --> 02:02.998
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE VOTED THE RIGHT WAY, BUT YOU DIDN'T

02:02.998 --> 02:03.998
VOTE THE RIGHT WAY.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.292
I AM ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE PICKING OFF THE BRAIN TRIBE NOW,

02:06.292 --> 02:08.997
BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF THAT INDECISION, BECAUSE I CAN'T

02:08.997 --> 02:09.834
TRUST THEM.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.998
 YOU STILL VOTED FOR JULIA, AND SO DID JOE.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.998
THAT'S A STRANGE WAY OF BUILDING TRUST.

02:13.998 --> 02:15.709
 I DIDN'T VOTE FOR JULIA.

02:15.709 --> 02:16.998
 YOU WROTE HER NAME DOWN.

02:16.998 --> 02:18.542
 I CROSSED IT OUT.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.998
PETER WENT HOME, WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT

02:20.998 --> 02:23.998
I WENT UP THERE, WROTE JULIA, CROSSED IT OUT AND WROTE PETER,

02:23.998 --> 02:27.998
AND I ENDED UP PUTTING A TARGET ON MY BACK AND ON JOE'S.

02:27.998 --> 02:29.998
SO FUTURE OF THE BRAINS TRIBE, WE'RE DONE.

02:29.998 --> 02:30.998
I THINK THAT'S IT.

02:30.998 --> 02:33.998
AND I THINK IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

02:33.998 --> 02:37.998
 AND YOU GUYS MADE IT INTO SOMETHING IT WASN'T BY VOTING

02:37.998 --> 02:39.125
FOR HER.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.292
IF I HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER TRIBAL, I AM ABSOLUTELY GOING TO

02:42.292 --> 02:46.998
WRITE DOWN AUBRY, JOE, AUBRY, JOE.

02:46.998 --> 02:49.998
AND I'LL JUST CROSS THEM OUT UNTIL I DECIDE WHICH ONE I WANT

02:49.998 --> 02:56.998
TO GO FIRST.

03:05.709 --> 03:10.834
 BOY--  CHICKEN, WIND CHILL INDEXEN.

03:10.834 --> 03:11.998
HE WANTS THAT FOOD.

03:11.998 --> 03:16.998
AUBRY, AFTER YOU DIG THAT OUT, WE CAN JUST-- OH, MY GOSH!

03:16.998 --> 03:18.998
THIS IS PEOPLE FOOD.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.998
YOU GET YOUR SHARE LATER.

03:20.998 --> 03:20.998
STOP!

03:20.998 --> 03:21.998
NO!

03:21.998 --> 03:22.998
 HE WANTS IT, MAN.

03:22.998 --> 03:28.998
 NO, NO, NO!

03:28.998 --> 03:29.542
NO!

03:29.542 --> 03:29.998
GO OVER HERE.

03:29.998 --> 03:31.998
YOU EAT THIS.

03:31.998 --> 03:32.998
YOU CAN PECK AT THIS.

03:32.998 --> 03:35.125
 HE WANTS THE LOOSE FEESES.

03:35.125 --> 03:38.000
TAI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHICKEN IS A FATHER TO A SON, I

03:38.000 --> 03:38.834
THINK.

03:38.834 --> 03:39.998
HE DOES EVERYTHING WITH THE DAMN BIRD.

03:39.998 --> 03:41.998
HE PROBABLY LIKES IT BETTER THAN US.

03:41.998 --> 03:44.998
AFTER TRIBAL, AUBRY AND I, WE'RE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, AND NOW

03:44.998 --> 03:52.998
TAI AND SCOT AND JULIA, THEY'VE GOT A THREE SELLAND TWO BRAINS,

03:52.998 --> 03:53.998
AND BYE-BYE BRAINS.

03:53.998 --> 03:56.959
AUBRY, SHE AT LEAST CHANGED HER VOTE BACK TO PETER.

03:56.959 --> 03:59.998
SO BOOM-BOOM, JOE'S DONE BECAUSE I BROKE RANKS.

03:59.998 --> 04:03.125
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME THAT CHICKEN'S DOING BETTER THAN ME.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.000
HE DOESN'T MISS A TRICK.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.998
 HE DOES NOT MISS A TRICK.

04:05.998 --> 04:06.998
 BOY.

04:06.998 --> 04:07.998
 HE LIKES THE COCONUT.

04:07.998 --> 04:26.999
 YEAH.

04:33.999 --> 04:37.125
 NEAL WAS WALKING AROUND WITH A BIG BULGE IN HIS POCKET, AND

04:37.125 --> 04:38.999
I'M JUST LIKE HMMM.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
I KNOW WHAT THE IDOL LOOKS LIKE.

04:40.999 --> 04:44.999
SO WHEN I SAW THE IMPRINT IN NEAL'S POCKET, I LOOKED AT

04:44.999 --> 04:44.999
JAISON.

04:44.999 --> 04:48.999
I WAS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLUSH THAT BAD BOY OUT.

04:48.999 --> 04:49.999
 WHICH POCKET?

04:49.999 --> 04:49.999
THE LEFT.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
 IN HIS CARGO.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
 HMM-HMM.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
 SO HOW TIE IT IS.

04:55.999 --> 04:59.834
IT'S A LOT HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.125
 IT'S CREEPING UP.

05:01.125 --> 05:01.999
WOW, MORE CRABS.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
 THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE CRAPS.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.125
 WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR POCKET?

05:06.125 --> 05:09.999
NEAL HAS A BULGE IN HIS CARGO POCKET, AND THE REASON I THINK

05:09.999 --> 05:13.999
IT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE THE IDOL IS BECAUSE I HAVE A MATCHING

05:13.999 --> 05:14.125
ONE.

05:14.125 --> 05:18.417
NOW THE TARGET'S REALLY ON HIM BECAUSE THAT MAKES HIM A THREAT

05:18.417 --> 05:19.999
TO EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, BUT I GOT TO WAIT.

05:19.999 --> 05:24.999
I GOT TO PLANT THE SEEDS AND WAIT FOR THE PERFECT TIME TO

05:24.999 --> 05:25.709
SPROUT UP.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.542
I'M AS PLEASED AS PUNCH RIGHT NOW.

05:27.542 --> 05:32.709
I KIND OF HOLD ALL THE POWER.

05:34.999 --> 05:39.292
 GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S HEADED TOWARDS US.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.999
 WHAT ON EARTH?

05:40.999 --> 05:44.999
 SURPRISE, SURPRISED, HUH?

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
 I WAS SITTING ON THE BEACH FEELING PRETTY GOOD, GETTING

05:47.999 --> 05:50.999
READY TO BLINDSIDE NEAL, AND THEN THIS BOAT SHOWS UP.

05:50.999 --> 05:52.959
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.000
CHAN LOH YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTE TO PICK UP EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND

05:55.000 --> 05:56.709
BOARD THIS BOAT.

05:56.709 --> 06:00.999
YOU'RE HEADING TO YOUR NEW HOME AT THE GONDOL CAMP.

06:00.999 --> 06:03.999
 FIVE MINUTES IS NOT A LOT OF TIME.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
 I MADE THE "SURVIVOR" MERGE.

06:05.999 --> 06:06.999
THAT'S CRAZY!

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
IT'S LIKE MY DREAM AS A KID.

06:08.999 --> 06:12.999
BUT, YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS IN A GOOD POSITION AT CHAN

06:12.999 --> 06:13.999
LOH.

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
NOWEG EVERYTHING SHIFTED.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.125
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THAT'S A

06:17.125 --> 06:17.999
SCARY THOUGHT.

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
 I GOT THEM.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.959
I GOT THEM.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.959
I GOT THEM.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.999
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TOUGH SO MAKING THE

06:24.999 --> 06:25.709
MERGE IS HUGE.

06:25.709 --> 06:26.542
I MADE IT.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.999
I NEVER DOUBTED THEY WOULD MAKE IT, HOWEVER.

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
YOU KNOW, THE GAME IS SWITCHED UP AGAIN AND IT'S REALLY GOING

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
TO BE INSANE OUT THERE.

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
I LOVE CHANGE.

06:33.999 --> 06:34.999
I LOVE MIXING IT UP.

06:34.999 --> 06:37.999
I TAKE THE OFFENSE, PULL PEOPLE IN, BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO BE

06:37.999 --> 06:38.999
PULLED IN.

06:38.999 --> 06:39.999
EVERYBODY'S DANGLING.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
I'LL PULL THEM IN.

06:41.999 --> 06:44.999
LOCK THEM DOWN.

07:22.999 --> 07:26.417
 AHOY!

07:26.417 --> 07:31.834
AHOY!

07:31.834 --> 07:32.999
 IT'S THE MERGE!

07:32.999 --> 07:34.125
 OH, MY GOD!

07:34.125 --> 07:37.999
( SCREAMING )  WHAT!

07:37.999 --> 07:41.999
 WE'RE SAVED!

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
 I MADE IT TO THE MERGE!

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
I MADE IT TO THE MERGE ON "SURVIVOR."

07:44.999 --> 07:46.959
THAT IS AWESOME.

07:46.959 --> 07:47.999
IT IS SUCH A HUGE DEAL.

07:47.999 --> 07:52.125
AND AS SOON AS I SAW JAISON AND CYDNEY, I JUST THOUGHT, OH, MAN,

07:52.125 --> 07:52.999
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN THE PLAY-OFFS.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.999
IT'S TIME TO START OVER, REFOCUS.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.999
HOPEFULLY MY TEAM IS STRONG AND READY TO GET A CHAMPIONSHIP.

08:00.999 --> 08:05.125
 I'M HOME!

08:05.125 --> 08:08.999
 AND JUST LIKE THAT, JOE AND I HAVE BEEN SAVED.

08:08.999 --> 08:12.999
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, I FELT LIKE TOTAL CRAP, SO MUCH SO,

08:12.999 --> 08:17.999
THAT I WAS TELLING MYSELF I'M A FREE AGENT.

08:17.999 --> 08:18.417
I'M SEPARATING FROM JOE.

08:18.417 --> 08:18.999
THAT'S IT.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.999
AND THEN TO SEE NEAL AND DEBBIE, I WAS SO RELIEVED.

08:21.999 --> 08:25.999
IT WAS LIKE BEING SEPARATED FROM YOUR WHACKY FAMILY AND THEN

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
SEEING THEM AGAIN.

08:27.999 --> 08:31.542
 I WOULD LOVE SOME SOFT CHEESE.

08:31.542 --> 08:32.999
 WHOSE GOT THE CRACKERS.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
 PASS THE CRACKERS.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
 SO HAIP WITH THE WINE.

08:35.999 --> 08:36.000
 CONGRATULATIONS ON THE MERGE.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.999
 CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY!

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
 EVERYBODY EARNED IT.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
 DOWN THE HATCH.

08:40.999 --> 08:43.999
 BRAINS, BEAUTY AND BRAWN ALL TOGETHER FINALLY, YOU'RE

08:43.999 --> 08:47.999
THINKING NUMBER-- FOUR BEAUTY, FOUR BRAIN, THREE BRAWN.

08:47.999 --> 08:51.999
HOW ARE WE GOING TO LINE UP?

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
IN "SURVIVOR," I HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
SCOT IS THE ONLY ALLY I KNOW AND HE'S THE MOST LOGICAL, SINCE HE

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
KNOWS ABOUT THE IDOL.

08:58.999 --> 09:01.000
 OKAY, NICK I HAVE A FULL CONFESSION.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.999
 NOT NOW.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
 I JUST WANTED TO CUDDLE WITH YOU JUST ONCE.

09:03.999 --> 09:07.999
I'M HAPPILY MARRIED, BUT YOU ARE A VERY GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

09:07.999 --> 09:11.999
( PURRING )  TAI.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
( PURRING ).

09:12.999 --> 09:14.417
 BACK OFF!

09:14.417 --> 09:17.417
 I'M TAKING HIM  NO!

09:17.417 --> 09:19.999
 I'LL SAVE YOU.

09:19.999 --> 09:25.999
 DURING THE MERGE FEAST, PEOPLE WERE GETTING A LITTLE

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
TIPSY, BUT I'M LISTENING LEFT AND RIGHT, SEEING WHO'S GETTING

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
ALONG, SEEING WHAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

09:30.999 --> 09:33.292
AND IT'S OBVIOUS THE BRAWN ARE GOING TO BE ARROGANT, LIKE

09:33.292 --> 09:34.999
THEY'RE IN CHARGE AND NOBODY CAN STOP THEM.

09:34.999 --> 09:38.999
 CYDNEY AND THE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SCOT'S

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
KNOCKED OUT, AND THERE'S A RAT ON HIS SHOULDER.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
AND WE'RE LIKE, WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL HIM.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
 THE BRAINS ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO WORK WITH THAT TYPE OF

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
PERSON BECAUSE THEATRE EXACT OPPOSITE.

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
THEY WANT TO BE IN THE SHADOWS.

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
 I'M GOOD.

09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
I CAN'T EAT ANYMORE.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
 EAT A DAMN COOKIE!

09:52.999 --> 09:56.999
 RIGHT NOW, MY TRUE ALLIANCE IS WITH MICHELE.

09:56.999 --> 10:01.708
WE'RE IN A GREAT SPOT WITHIN THESE TWO TRIBES, BUT I'VE

10:01.708 --> 10:03.958
LEARNED SLOW IT DOWN.

10:03.958 --> 10:04.999
READ THE PEOPLE.

10:04.999 --> 10:08.958
LET THEM KEEP BRINGING YOU INFORMATION, AND THEN YOU JUST

10:08.958 --> 10:10.999
SLICE THEM UP.

10:10.999 --> 10:13.958
 PETER WENT INSANE.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.292
YOU GUYS ARE ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

10:15.292 --> 10:16.999
 NO, YOU'RE IN.

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
I'VE GOT YOUR BARK MAN.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
 ARE YOU AND NEAL STILL GOOD?

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
 ABSOLUTELY.

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
TIGHTER THAN EVER.

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
SALT AND PEPPER.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.833
EBONY AND IVORY.

10:25.833 --> 10:25.999
 OKAY.

10:25.999 --> 10:30.417
TOILT TOILET PAPER AND TOILETS, YEAH.

10:30.417 --> 10:33.999
AUBRY IS A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT THE WAY THINGS PANNED OUT AND

10:33.999 --> 10:34.000
FEELS GUILTY.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.999
SHE HAS NO NEED TO DO WHAT.

10:35.999 --> 10:39.999
I KNOW THE FOUR BRAINS-- MYSELF, AUBRY, NEAL AND JOE-- WE'RE

10:39.999 --> 10:43.999
STILL STRONG.

10:43.999 --> 10:47.000
 SEEMS LIKE THE BRAWN ARE SUPER TIGHT.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.834
THAT'S THREE, RIGHT?

10:49.834 --> 10:49.999
DEFINITELY.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
 I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD BE WILLING TO STICK TOGETHER.

10:53.999 --> 10:54.125
 YEAH?

10:54.125 --> 10:57.959
 THE BRAWN ARE GOING TO BE AN ONGOING PHYSICAL THREAT.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.417
BUT THEY'RE JUST KIND OF BULLIES.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.999
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH A BEAUTY AND BRAIN ALLIANCE.

11:01.999 --> 11:05.999
 DO YOU THINK YOUR BEAUTIES ARE GOING TO STICK TOGETHER AND

11:05.999 --> 11:06.999
HAVE YOUR BACKS.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
 THE BEAUTIES.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.542
 YEAH.

11:08.542 --> 11:08.999
 I DON'T THINK SO.

11:08.999 --> 11:13.999
I'M GETTING THE VIBE THAT TAI IS SUPER TIGHT WITH SCOT NOW, AND

11:13.999 --> 11:17.999
I'M GETTING THE VIBE THAT JULIA WAS SAVED LAST NIGHT BY SCOT.

11:17.999 --> 11:20.999
 WHAT ABOUT MICHELE?

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
MICHELE, I THINK SHE'LL STICK WITH ME.

11:22.999 --> 11:23.999
I HOPE SO.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.999
NEAL AND AUBRY PITCHED THE FACT THAT, HEY, WE JUST NEED TWO MORE

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
OF YOUR BEAUTY.

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
NICK, CAN YOU GET IN MICHELE?

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
YEAH, I CAN PROBABLY GET IN MICHELE.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.999
SO THEY WANTED TO BE THE BRAINS VERSUS THE BRAWN, JUST LIKE I

11:35.999 --> 11:35.999
THOUGHT.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.999
SO HOW MANY VOTES DO WE NEED, THEN?

11:37.999 --> 11:38.999
 SIX TO WIN.

11:38.999 --> 11:39.999
 SIX TO WIN THIS VOTE, OKAY.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.999
AND WE JUST FUT ON ONE OF THE THREE BRONZE.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
DOES IT MATTER WHO?

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
 PREFERABLY ONE THAT HAS AN IDOL.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
 IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH THE BRAINS, BUT IF YOU CORNER

11:49.999 --> 11:52.999
YOURSELF, IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOUR BACK IS

11:52.999 --> 11:58.999
AGAINST THE WALL, THAT'S NOT GOOD "SURVIVOR."

11:58.999 --> 12:00.833
 DO SOME STARS.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.999
 I'M GOING TO START WRITING NAMES.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
 DO YOU WANT TO DO RED?

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
 ISN'T THAT CUTE?

12:04.999 --> 12:05.999
 THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.958
 BEAUTIFUL.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.999
 YEAH, LIKE, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
 I'M SO HAPPY.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
 YOU GUYS HAVE GOTTEN ALONG OVER HERE, THOUGH?

12:12.999 --> 12:16.999
 WELL, TAI AND I ARE... WE'RE GOOD.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
JULIA, I THINK WE HAVE LOYALTY BECAUSE WE SAVED HER LAST NIGHT.

12:19.999 --> 12:22.000
 OH, YEAH, SHE'S INDEBTED TO YOU GUYS.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.999
 SO WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
 IT'S MERGE TIME.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.999
AND THE BRAWN, WE GOT TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.999
SO WE WERE OPEN WITH NICK, BECAUSE WE WANT HIM TO FEEL

12:31.999 --> 12:32.417
COMFORTABLE.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.999
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED HIM FOR THE NUMBERS.

12:33.999 --> 12:37.834
AND I BELIEVE THAT NEAL HAS AN IDOL.

12:37.834 --> 12:40.292
SO NEAL IS THE MAIN FOCUS.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.999
 WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
 I THINK NEAL HAS AN IDOL.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
 SO HOW DO WE GET HIM OUT FIRST?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
 YOU SPLIT IT.

12:47.999 --> 12:48.999
 SPLIT THE VOTE, OKAY.

12:48.999 --> 12:52.999
 YOU GOTTA WONDER IF SCOT AND JAISON HAD TOO MUCH RUM AT THE

12:52.999 --> 12:53.999
MERGE FEAST.

12:53.999 --> 12:58.834
SCOT WELCOMED ME RIGHT AWAY, AND JAISON SAYS, "NEAL HAS AN IDOL."

12:58.834 --> 13:00.999
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME INTO YOUR ALLIANCE.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
YOU'RE SUCH SWEETHEARTS, BOTH OF US.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.999
 THIS IS THE THREE OF US, NOT EVEN CYDNEY.

13:05.999 --> 13:06.999
TAI FOUND AN IDOL.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.292
HE SHOWED IT TO ME.

13:08.292 --> 13:09.958
 HOLY CRAP.

13:09.958 --> 13:10.417
THIS IS UNREAL.

13:10.417 --> 13:13.999
TAI HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE WHEN

13:13.999 --> 13:17.999
YOU TAKE TWO SEPARATE IDOLS, MINE AND EVEN HIS, AND YOU LINK

13:17.999 --> 13:20.999
THEM TOGETHER, NOW WE HAVE A SUPER IDOL THAT WE CAN PLAY

13:20.999 --> 13:26.999
AFTER THE VOTES HAVE BEEN READ, WHICH MEANS WE ARE LITERALLY

13:26.999 --> 13:27.999
UNSTOPPABLE.

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
NOW, ONLY YOU AND TAI KNOW ABOUT TAI'S IDOL.

13:30.999 --> 13:31.999
 NOW YOU TWO.

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

13:32.999 --> 13:35.999
THE ONLY REASON I TOLD YOU IS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE TIGHT.

13:35.999 --> 13:39.999
 I DON'T LIKE SCOT'S AND JAISON'S OVER-CONFIDENCE.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.709
THEY'RE JUST LIKE SCREW EVERYBODY ELSE.

13:41.709 --> 13:42.999
THIS IS OUR GAME.

13:42.999 --> 13:46.999
BUT AS MUCH AS IT ANNOYS ME, THAT'S A GREAT THING FOR ME.

13:46.999 --> 13:47.999
IT REALLY IS.

13:47.999 --> 13:50.292
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO EXPECT A BLINDSIDE ON THEM.

13:50.292 --> 13:51.292
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE IT COMING.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.999
 DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DISGUSTING?

14:15.999 --> 14:19.708
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M TOOIG.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.999
 MY FIREMEN.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
 GOOD MORNING!

14:23.999 --> 14:26.417
 TAI, I REALLY LIKE YOU.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.999
I WANT TO GET IN AN ALLIANCE.

14:29.999 --> 14:30.999
 OKAY.

14:30.999 --> 14:33.542
 WE'D HAVE THE NUMBERS.

14:33.542 --> 14:34.999
 WE'D HAVE THE NUMBERS?

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
 YEP.

14:35.999 --> 14:36.999
 OKAY.

14:36.999 --> 14:40.000
 I SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE HERE THAT PLAYS OFFENSE,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.292
AND I KNOW I NEED SIX TO HAVE THE NUMBERS OVER BRAWN.

14:44.292 --> 14:47.542
IT'S A BATTLE FOR POWER, AND I'M PLAYING TO WIN.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.999
ALL RIGHT.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.959
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.999
 I MEAN, IT'S COMING AS SUCH A SHOCK.

14:56.999 --> 14:59.999
UH--  WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY HERE ON

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
OUT, NOW THAT WE'RE SINGLE.

15:00.999 --> 15:03.999
 WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO GO INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH

15:03.999 --> 15:04.000
SOMEBODY.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.999
 YOU JUST DID.

15:04.999 --> 15:07.999
 I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, I DIDN'T EVEN SIT DOWN, DEBBIE

15:07.999 --> 15:11.958
LIKE TWO SECONDING BEHIND ME, SHE SAY, "HEY, I REALLY LIKE

15:11.958 --> 15:11.999
YOU.

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN OUR ALLIANCE."

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
IT WAS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.

15:14.999 --> 15:15.999
 HE'S IN.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
WE GOT HIM.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
 I'M NOT BUYING HER STORY.

15:19.999 --> 15:21.000
I'M NOT A FOOL.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.999
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH DEBBIE.

15:24.999 --> 15:28.708
 SO, NICK, ARE YOU WITH US?

15:28.708 --> 15:29.999
 NEAL AND YOU?

15:29.999 --> 15:32.999
 AND PROBABLY MICHELE, TOO.

15:32.999 --> 15:38.959
 SO, DEBBIE THINKS THAT SHE HAS MICHELE?

15:38.959 --> 15:44.959
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT GOING HOME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.999
 SHE'S NOT BEING VERY FINESSEY ABOUT THIS.

15:46.999 --> 15:51.999
 AND ZIP IT.

15:51.999 --> 15:53.999
 DEB NEEDS TO COOL HER JETS.

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
SHE IS TRYING TOO HARD.

15:55.999 --> 15:58.292
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAMING PEOPLE ISN'T THE WAY TO GO WHEN YOU'RE

15:58.292 --> 15:59.959
TRYING TO GET THE NUMBERS.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.999
YOU HAVE TO SHOW CONFIDENCE, AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE SHOWING

16:02.999 --> 16:09.999
DESPERATION.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.999
 IF THE BRAWN AND BEAUTY BAND TOGETHER--

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
 THERE'S SO MANY OF US.

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
 WE'RE SEVEN TO FOUR.

16:16.999 --> 16:20.999
 WE'LL MAKE ONE FAMILY AND FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE.

16:20.999 --> 16:23.708
BOUD BUTTY ALWAYS GOES WITH THE JOCK, ALWAYS.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.999
IT'S JUST THE WAY OF THE WORLD.

16:25.999 --> 16:29.999
THE BOUD BUTTIES DON'T DATE THE BRAINIACS.

16:29.999 --> 16:33.542
THEY'RE AT THE DANCE WITH US AND WE'RE SHOVING GEEKS IN LOCKERS

16:33.542 --> 16:33.999
NOW.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
SORRY, BRAIN.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
 NEAL HAS AN IDOL.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.999
 SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF AUBRY.

16:38.999 --> 16:39.999
 THEY WON'T SEE IT COMING.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.999
 WE WANT TO GO AFTER NEAL, BUT WE BELIEVE HE'S HOLDING THE

16:43.999 --> 16:44.959
IDOL.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.125
SO WE TAKE OUT SOMEONE THEY NEVER SEE COMING, AUBRY.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.999
 THEY'RE GOING TO THINK IT'S NEAL, THEN JOE.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
 THEN DEB.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
THEY'LL THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE.

16:53.999 --> 16:53.999
 YEAH.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.417
 I THINK JAISON PROBABLY THINKS THAT HE'S ON TOP.

16:56.417 --> 16:59.999
HE'S THE ONE WHO IS CONSTANTLY GOING, "HEY, THIS IS WHAT'S

16:59.999 --> 17:00.999
GOING ON.

17:00.999 --> 17:01.999
THIS IS WHAT THIS PERSON SAID.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING."

17:03.999 --> 17:06.999
SO IT LOOKS LIKE BRAWN AND BEAUTY ARE KIND OF TOGETHER.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
BUT BRAWN IS WAY TOO CONTROLLING.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
OH, MAN.

17:09.999 --> 17:16.999
AND I NEVER COUNTED OUT WORKING WITH BRAIN.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.999
 SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER TALKED TO YOU BEFORE.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
 I KNOW, RIGHT?

17:20.999 --> 17:23.959
 BUT--  NOT ONE ON ONE.

17:23.959 --> 17:24.125
 YEAH.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.125
I'M ON BOARD WITH THE BRAINS STICKING TOGETHER, BUT SOMEONE

17:27.125 --> 17:30.999
IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR HEAD OUT OF THEIR BUTT AND START

17:30.999 --> 17:33.999
TALKING TO PEOPLE LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
 DEBBIE IS GOING OFF HER ROCKER.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
 YOU CAN'T DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM PEOPLE.

17:37.999 --> 17:38.999
 SHE GOES OFF THE HANDLE.

17:38.999 --> 17:43.999
 I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE ARE IRRITATED BY

17:43.999 --> 17:46.999
DEBBIE, AND IF WE DON'T GET THE BEAUTIES ON OUR SIDE, THE BRAINS

17:46.999 --> 17:47.541
ARE SCREWED.

17:47.541 --> 17:48.999
I MEAN, I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.

17:48.999 --> 17:49.834
 NO, I KNOW.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.999
 YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE--  BUT THE THING SDEBBIE, I'M

17:52.999 --> 17:56.999
TELLING YOU, DEBBIE'S AWFUL.

17:56.999 --> 18:01.999
I'M STILL OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE BRAIN TRIBE, BUT DEBBIE IS

18:01.999 --> 18:02.999
AGGRAVATING ME AT THIS POINT.

18:02.999 --> 18:07.999
SHE ALMOST TAKES STRATEGY IN HER OWN HANDS FOR THE BRAINS TRIBE,

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY HAVING MORE POWER THAN I DO IN THIS

18:09.999 --> 18:17.999
GAME.

18:17.999 --> 18:21.000
 EVERYONE IS TOTALLY FED UP WITH DEBBIE, AND I FEEL LIKE

18:21.000 --> 18:21.999
WE'RE SCREWED BECAUSE OF IT.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.999
 DO YOU THINK NICK IS RUNNING AWAY?

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
 I TALKED TO NICK, AND I THINK HE'S-- YEAH.

18:26.999 --> 18:27.999
I DO.

18:27.999 --> 18:33.999
I THINK FOR HIM, LIKE, JUST GOING BY THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS

18:33.999 --> 18:38.999
IS POSSIBLY MORE APPEALING THAN DEEG DOOELG WITH DEB RIGHT NOW.

18:38.999 --> 18:39.999
IT'S REALLY BAD.

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
 WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET AT LEAST TWO OF THE BEAUTIES ON

18:42.999 --> 18:46.000
BOARD, BUT PEOPLE ARE SO TURNED OFF BY DEBBIE.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.999
IT'S BAD.

18:46.999 --> 18:47.999
WE'RE IN A BAD SITUATION.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.416
 DO YOU HAVE THE IDOL?

18:49.416 --> 18:51.999
 I HAVE ONE FROM THE FIRST CAMP.

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
SO HOW CAN WE TIEWZ TO OUR ADVANTAGE?

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
 SOMEONE HAS TO TELL US WHO'S GETTING VOTED OUT TOMORROW.

18:59.999 --> 19:02.125
AND WE JUST USE IT.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.999
I'M GETTING A GOOD ROLLER COASTER OUT OF "SURVIVOR," MAN.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.959
I WAS THINKING WE'RE SCREWED.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.999
BUT NOW, IT TURNS OUT NEAL HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

19:09.999 --> 19:13.999
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED TO START DOING THINGS.

19:13.999 --> 19:14.999
THE GAME IS ON.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
LET'S GO.

19:29.834 --> 19:41.125
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

19:41.125 --> 19:44.999
ALL RIGHT, SO I WAS TALKING TO MEDICAL, AND THEY SAID YOU GUYS

19:44.999 --> 19:45.999
WERE PRETTY BANGED UP.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.959
TAI, BE HOW IS THIS GROUP DOING PHYSICALLY?

19:47.959 --> 19:52.999
 WE HAVE A LOT OF CUTS, EARLY ON, THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
KNOW THAT NEAL HAS A COUPLE OF INFECTIONES.

19:54.999 --> 19:55.999
 Jeff: A COUPLE OF INFECTIONS?

19:55.999 --> 20:00.959
 I KIND OF HAD THIS LITTLE VOLCANO POP UP IN MY KNEE.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.999
I DUBBED IT "MOUNT SAINT NEAL."

20:03.999 --> 20:04.999
IT FEELS FINE, THOUGH.

20:04.999 --> 20:08.999
 Jeff: SCOT, IS THERE AN AWARENESS THAT INFECTIONS OUT

20:08.999 --> 20:12.999
HERE REALLY CAN BE DEADLY, THAT IT'S FOR-- FOR ALL THE JOKES OF

20:12.999 --> 20:13.999
NAMING IT, THAT IT IS SERIOUS?

20:13.999 --> 20:15.125
 YEAH, I'VE GOT ONE, TOO.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.999
 I'VE GOT ONE, TOO.

20:16.999 --> 20:21.999
 Jeff: WHERE'S YOUR'S AUBRY?

20:21.999 --> 20:24.709
 INSIDE MY LEG.

20:24.709 --> 20:25.416
ANOTHER MOUNTAIN.

20:25.416 --> 20:26.999
 Jeff: ANYBODY ELSE?

20:26.999 --> 20:29.999
 I HAVE TWO BIG ONES.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
I STARTED GETTING A SCAB.

20:31.999 --> 20:34.999
IT WAS SO RAW AND BURNED BUT THIS IS THE BEST I FEEL.

20:34.999 --> 20:38.541
 Jeff: JAISON, IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT REACHES CRITICAL MASS,

20:38.541 --> 20:41.709
IF IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, YOU'RE NOT WORTHY.

20:41.709 --> 20:41.999
 IT'S TRUE.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
THE ELEMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN EASIOUS, BUT WE'VE ALL KIND OF

20:44.999 --> 20:48.999
SOLDIERED ON AND DEALT WITH IT, EMBRACED THE SUCK AND KEPT

20:48.999 --> 20:48.999
GOING.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO KEEP GOING.

20:50.999 --> 20:51.291
 YES!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.834
 YES, WE ARE.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.999
 Jeff: IT IS TIME TO GET TO YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

20:55.999 --> 20:55.999
CHALLENGE.

20:55.999 --> 20:59.999
FIRST THINGS, FIRST, DEBBIE, I'LL TAKE BACK TRIBAL IMMUNITY.

20:59.999 --> 21:00.999
DONE WITH THIS.

21:00.999 --> 21:03.999
GAME NOW SHIFTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL PORTION.

21:03.999 --> 21:06.709

21:06.709 --> 21:08.416
 OOH.

21:08.416 --> 21:08.999
 WOW.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.416
 Jeff: INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

21:10.416 --> 21:12.709

21:12.709 --> 21:13.959
LET'S GET TO IT.

21:13.959 --> 21:16.999
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ON A LOG WHILE

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
BALANCING A BALL ON A WOODEN DISK.

21:18.999 --> 21:23.999
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, WE WILL ADD MORE BALLS, MAKING IT MORE

21:23.999 --> 21:24.834
DIFFICULT.

21:24.834 --> 21:28.416
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF OF YOUR PERCH OR A BALL DROPS,

21:28.416 --> 21:28.999
YOU'RE OUT.

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE

21:31.999 --> 21:33.000
VOTE.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.999
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
AFTER 19 VERY TOUGH DAYS.

21:38.999 --> 21:48.999

22:01.000 --> 22:01.959
SECURE.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR FIRST BALL.

22:03.999 --> 22:08.000
PLACE IT ON YOUR DISK.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.999
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

22:10.999 --> 22:16.999

22:23.291 --> 22:27.999

22:27.999 --> 22:30.999
IF YOUR BALL HITS THE GROUND, YOU'RE OUT.

22:30.999 --> 22:35.999
IF YOU STEP OFF THE PERCH, YOU'RE OUT.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
JOE, FIRST TO STEP OFF.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999

22:52.416 --> 22:57.834
SCOT DOING A NICE JOB OF RECOVERING FROM AN EARLY WAVER.

22:57.834 --> 22:57.999
BIG FEET.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
HARD TO BALANCE ON THAT LITTLE LOG.

23:00.999 --> 23:04.709
SOMETIMES BEING TALL IS AN ADVANTAGE, SOMETIMES NOT.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.541
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.834
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT'S OKAY.

23:09.834 --> 23:11.999
JUST STAY IN CONTROL OF IT.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
THIS FIRST INTERVAL WILL BE FIVE MINUTES.

23:13.999 --> 23:23.999
YOU'RE AT TWO MINUTES.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.000
30 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.999
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

23:27.999 --> 23:34.999
DON'T GET EXCITED.

23:34.999 --> 23:37.000
JAISON CANNOT HANG IN.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.999
10 SECONDS LEFT.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.541
JAISON, THE THIRD PERSON OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.999
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.000
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.999
YOU'RE GOOD.

23:49.999 --> 23:53.999
GET READY FOR ROUND TWO.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
IT'S TIME TO ADD A SECOND BALL.

23:55.999 --> 24:00.999
EVERYBODY PUT TWO BALLS ON YOUR DISK.

24:00.999 --> 24:03.000
AND HERE WE GO IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.999
PULL YOUR HANDS AWAY.

24:04.999 --> 24:08.999
WE ARE LIVE.

24:08.999 --> 24:11.541
AND NOW IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT.

24:11.541 --> 24:12.999
RIGHT AWAY A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.291
MICHELE IS OUT QUICKLY.

24:14.291 --> 24:15.416
NEAL IS OUT.

24:15.416 --> 24:16.999
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

24:16.999 --> 24:20.999
JUST LIKE THAT, SCOT DROPS OUT, AND WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.

24:20.999 --> 24:25.416
IN A MATTER OF 20 SECONDS IN THIS ROUND, THREE PEOPLE ARE

24:25.416 --> 24:25.999
OUT.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
CYDNEY'S OUT.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.

24:28.999 --> 24:32.999
AUBRY IS OUT.

24:32.999 --> 24:37.709
IT IS DOWN TO THREE ORIGINAL BEAUTY MEMBERS.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.999
A LOT CHANGES AT THE MERGE.

24:39.999 --> 24:42.959
OFTEN THE GAME IS REALLY UP IN THE AIR.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.999
YOU WANT TO BE SAFE TONIGHT.

24:45.999 --> 24:48.999
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.

24:48.999 --> 24:56.999
TAI'S BALLS BANGING INTO EACH OTHER, NEVER GOOD.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
NICK WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.000
HIS BALLS DANCING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.999
BUT HE'S GOT THEM BACK STEADY AGAIN.

25:05.999 --> 25:13.416
JULIA LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STEADY, LIKE A STATUE.

25:13.416 --> 25:17.999
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY STEADY RIGHT NOW.

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
TWO MINUTES INTO THIS ROUND.

25:19.999 --> 25:37.999
WE'LL GO FIVE MINUTES AGAIN BEFORE WE ADD ANOTHER BALL.

25:37.999 --> 25:42.416
10 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.

25:42.416 --> 25:46.999
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.000
THIS ROUND IS OVER.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.999
YOU'RE ALL SAFE.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
 NICE JOB!

25:50.999 --> 25:53.416
( APPLAUSE ) NICE JOB, GUYS.

25:53.416 --> 25:57.999
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

25:57.999 --> 26:03.999
TIME NOW TO ADD A THIRD BALL, AND WE WILL NOW GO UNTIL THE

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
END.

26:04.999 --> 26:11.999
GET YOURSELF STEADY.

26:11.999 --> 26:15.999
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

26:15.999 --> 26:20.999
REMOVE YOUR HANDS.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.999
EVERYBODY WITH THREE BALLS, RIGHT AWAY A LOT OF MOVEMENT FOR

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
NICK BUT A NICE RECOVER.

26:27.999 --> 26:28.999
RIGHT BACK IN IT.

26:28.999 --> 26:36.834
JULIA WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.

26:36.834 --> 26:39.999
JULIA, THE MOST STEAD NETHIS CHALLENGE DROPS, LEAVING US WITH

26:39.999 --> 26:44.999
A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN NICK AND TAI.

26:44.999 --> 26:45.999
FOR IMMUNITY.

26:45.999 --> 26:46.999
STARTED WITH 11.

26:46.999 --> 26:57.709
NINE HAVE DROPPED.

26:57.709 --> 26:58.999
NICK WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

26:58.999 --> 26:59.999
A LOT OF MOVEMENT FROM TAI.

26:59.999 --> 27:04.999
CAN HE RECOVER?

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
NO, TAI DROPS.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.999
NICK WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S

27:10.999 --> 27:11.000
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.999
 GOOD JOB.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
 I WISH I COULD SEE YOU OVER THERE.

27:14.999 --> 27:16.999
I WANTED TO LOOK.

27:16.999 --> 27:17.000
 GOOD JOB.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.999
 NICE JOB.

27:18.999 --> 27:27.999
 Jeff: NICK, COME ON OVER.

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
FIRST INDIVIDUAL WIN, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

27:29.999 --> 27:34.999
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 19 CLEARLY DIFFICULT DAYS, SOMEBODY

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.959
IT WON'T BE YOU.

27:37.959 --> 27:37.999
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

27:39.999 --> 27:40.999
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

27:40.999 --> 27:43.999
 TONIGHT IT WILL BE THE FOUR BRAINS GOING UP AGAINST THE

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
BULLIES, AGAINST THE BRAWN.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.999
FORTUNATELY, I HAVE THE IDOL, AND IF I THINK I NEED TO PLAY

27:48.999 --> 27:49.999
IT, I'LL PLAY IT.

27:49.999 --> 27:53.999
I COULD SAVE MYSELF OR MAY PASS IT ON TO AUBRY, AND HOPEFULLY

27:53.999 --> 27:55.999
WE'LL TAKE CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

28:05.999 --> 28:07.999
 GOOD JOB, NICK!

28:07.999 --> 28:11.999
 GOOD JOB, NICK!

28:11.999 --> 28:14.999
 TONIGHT IS THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL AFTER THE MERGE.

28:14.999 --> 28:18.999
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE OF WHERE THE DOMINOES WILL

28:18.999 --> 28:19.709
FALL.

28:19.709 --> 28:24.291
OR SO I BELIEVE.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.125
IT'S BRAWN VERSUS BRAINS, AND I'M IN THE MIDDLE, ALONG WITH

28:27.125 --> 28:27.999
BEAUTY, FOR THE MOST PART.

28:27.999 --> 28:32.416
WE'RE LIKE THE PRETTY GIRL AT THE DANCE-- YOU'RE EITHER GOING

28:32.416 --> 28:35.999
HOME WITH THE QUARTERBACK OR YOU'RE GOING HOME WITH THE

28:35.999 --> 28:36.125
VALEDICTORIAN.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.541
IT'S A FUN POSITION TO BE IN.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.999
IT'S FUN BEING THE PRETTY GIRL.

28:38.999 --> 28:42.000
I NEVER FELT LIKE A PRETTY GIRL BEFORE, BUT NOW I DO.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.999
IT FEELS GREAT.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.000
 SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.999
 YEAH, EVERYBODY'S VOTING FOR AUBRY.

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
 IT'S AN OBVIOUS SEVEN VERSUS FOUR.

28:48.999 --> 28:49.709
 OH, YEAH!

28:49.709 --> 28:50.999
 THE BRAINS ARE SCREWED.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.999
WE'RE GOING TO JUST PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE UNTIL THEY'RE

28:53.999 --> 28:53.999
GONE.

28:53.999 --> 28:57.999
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS NEAL PLAYS AN IDOL BECAUSE HE'S

28:57.999 --> 28:59.125
PARANOID, BUT OCTOBERRY GOES HOME ANYWAY.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.999
 WE'RE JUST GOING LEFT FIELD AND GETTING AUBRY OUT BECAUSE

29:02.999 --> 29:05.125
THEY'LL NEVER SUSPECT IT.

29:05.125 --> 29:08.000
 I FEEL CONFIDENT IN OUR ALLIANCE OF BEAUTY AND BRAWN

29:08.000 --> 29:11.999
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE EVERYBODY SEEMS TO FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE

29:11.999 --> 29:14.291
GOING, "HEY, WHY NOT?

29:14.291 --> 29:15.999
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE BRAINS OUT."

29:15.999 --> 29:19.999
AND ONCE WE GET TO SEVEN, THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, EVEN THOUGH

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
JASON AND I ALREADY HAVE IT FIGURED OUT.

29:22.999 --> 29:25.125
AND WE GO UP FOUR SPOTS IN ABOUT A WEEK.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.999
 AND THEN WE JUST CHOP THEM DOWN ONE BY ONE, RIGHT?

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
 RIGHT.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.999
 RIGHT NOW I'M LEANING TOWARDS BRAWN AND VOTING OUT ONE OF THE

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
BRAINS RIGHT AWAY.

29:32.999 --> 29:36.999
BUT SCOT AND JASON ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE OVER-CONFIDENT, AND

29:36.999 --> 29:43.999
WHEN EVERYBODY FEELS SAFE IS WHEN YOU DO YOUR DAMAGE.

29:43.999 --> 29:47.125
 BECAUSE THE THING IS, IT'S LIKE THOSE THREE THEY'RE GOING

29:47.125 --> 29:50.999
TO BE SUCH A DOMINANT FORTH PHYSICALLY.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.959
 OH, YEAH, THE THREE BRAWN.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.834
 SO THEY'RE JUST GOING TO USE THESE GIRLS FOR THEIR VOTES AND

29:56.834 --> 29:58.999
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO DISPOSE OF THEM AND BE A TOP THREE.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
 YEAH, THEY'RE'S FIRM THREE.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.709
 WITH OUR GROUP, THERE'S A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING

30:03.709 --> 30:03.999
SOME CHALLENGES.

30:03.999 --> 30:06.999
 IF WE HAVE THE SIX, WE'RE GOOD THEN.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.709
 SO I GET MICHELE.

30:08.709 --> 30:11.000
 NICK, I BELIEVE,MENTS TO GO WITH US.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.999
SO NOW WE HAVE TO CONVINCE MICHELE TO COME ON BOARD.

30:13.999 --> 30:17.999
WE NEED TO HAVE SIX, BUT IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION, ALL I

30:17.999 --> 30:22.999
HAVE TO DO IS REACH THE FAMILY JEWELS RA& GRAB OUT IDOL.

30:22.999 --> 30:24.999
I THINK MICHELE IS OUR BEST BET.

30:24.999 --> 30:30.999
 I'LL TALK TO MICHELE.

30:30.999 --> 30:33.999
 ANY CLUES TOO WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
 NOBODY HAS REALLY APPROACHED ME ABOUT AISTITION.

30:35.999 --> 30:38.999
 THEN LET'S MAKE SOMETHING BETWEEN THE THREE OF US AND DO

30:38.999 --> 30:39.000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.999
WE'VE GOT TO PLAY THIS GAME.

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
 I THINK THAT IT'S-- I DON'T KNOW.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
WHAT DO ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

30:44.999 --> 30:45.999
 JASON OR SCOT.

30:45.999 --> 30:45.999
 YEAH.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
 WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS TONIGHT.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE SCOT OR JASON OUT.

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
 I AGREE.

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
TO GAIN POWER IN THIS GAME, THE BRAINS NEED NICK.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.959
THE BRAINS NEED MICHELE.

30:55.959 --> 30:56.999
I WANT A BRAWN GONE.

30:56.999 --> 30:58.999
AND WE HAVE TO START MAKING STUFF HAPPEN.

30:58.999 --> 31:02.709
THE BRAINS DON'T GET NICK AND MICHELE, NEAL AND I ARE PLAYING

31:02.709 --> 31:02.999
THE IDOL.

31:02.999 --> 31:06.999
THEY ARE SO TIGHT, THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER WAY TO BREAK

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
THEM UP.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.999
 AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TOWN ARE THE GAME.

31:09.999 --> 31:13.125
 THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS FOR BEAUTY AND BRAIN TO,

31:13.125 --> 31:15.999
LIKE, MELD AND MESS IT UP, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AS CONCRETE AS

31:15.999 --> 31:16.000
THEM.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.999
 YEAH, I AGREE WITH THAT.

31:17.999 --> 31:24.999
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH AUBRY AND DEBBIE, BUT I'M NOT

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
SURE STRATEGICALLY IT'S MY BEST OPTION.

31:26.999 --> 31:29.999
I THINK I HAVE TO KIND OF ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIPS MORE.

31:29.999 --> 31:34.999
I COULD GO WHICHEVER WAY I WANTED RIGHT NOW, SO I'M

31:34.999 --> 31:38.416
FIGURING OUT WHAT IS BEST FOR ME.

31:38.416 --> 31:41.000
 SO THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.

31:41.000 --> 31:41.999
 YEAH.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.541
 OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

31:43.541 --> 31:46.999
 JASON HAS PISSED ENOUGH PEOPLE OFF WHERE I DON'T THINK

31:46.999 --> 31:47.709
THEY WOULD VOTE FOR HIM.

31:47.709 --> 31:48.999
 NO, NOT AT ALL.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.999
 SCOT, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM EITHER

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
BECAUSE HE HAS THE MONEY.

31:52.999 --> 31:53.999
 RIGHT.

31:53.999 --> 31:57.291
 SO THIS IS MY THINKING.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.999
WE'RE GOING WITH BRAWN.

31:58.999 --> 32:00.999
 AGREED.

32:00.999 --> 32:00.999
ING.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
 YEAH, SO WE'RE GOOD.

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH?

32:04.999 --> 32:05.291
 AUBRY.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.999
 IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH BRAWN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DO

32:07.999 --> 32:10.999
BELIEVE I CAN MANIPULATE THEM JUST LIKE THAT.

32:10.999 --> 32:13.125
AND BEAT THEM IN PUZZLES JUST LIKE THAT.

32:13.125 --> 32:15.999
THEY'RE JUST IDIOTS.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
I LIKE AUBRY.

32:16.999 --> 32:19.999
I WOULD HANG OUT WITH AUBRY MORE THAN ANY OTHER GIRLS HERE.

32:19.999 --> 32:23.959
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, AUBRY'S GOING

32:23.959 --> 32:25.999
HOME.

32:25.999 --> 32:28.999
 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TELL THE BRAINS, OKAY, YEAH, WE

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

32:29.999 --> 32:32.999
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SURPRISE THEM AT TRIBAL COUNCIL AND BE

32:32.999 --> 32:37.000
LIKE WE'RE VOTING ONE OF YOU BRAINS OUT.

32:37.000 --> 32:37.999
WE'RE IN THE SWING POSITION.

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
IT'S ALL WE CAN DO.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
I KNOW HOW BIG OF A DECISION THIS IS.

32:40.999 --> 32:43.999
I THINK I'M MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
I'LL SEE WHEN THE GAME ENDS IF IT IS OR IT ISN'T.

32:46.999 --> 32:46.999
 SOUNDS GOOD.

32:46.999 --> 32:56.999
 GOOD.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.959
 UH-OH.

32:58.959 --> 32:59.541
ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS?

32:59.541 --> 33:00.999
 NO, WHAT'S THIS?

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
JEFF'S HERE?

33:01.999 --> 33:04.999
 GETTING READY FOR TRIBAL TONIGHT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN JEFF

33:04.999 --> 33:05.999
IS COMING.

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
THE DOCTOR IS COMING TO US.

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
IMMEDIATELY, RED FLAGS WENT UP.

33:09.999 --> 33:10.834
JEFF DOESN'T DO THIS.

33:10.834 --> 33:14.999
THE DOCTORS DON'T DO THIS. AT LEAST ONE OF US IS IN SERIOUS

33:14.999 --> 33:15.999
ENOUGH CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD COME TO US.

33:15.999 --> 33:19.999
THIS SEASON OF "SURVIVOR," IT'S TOUGH.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
 WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU MADE HOUSE CALLS.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.291
 Jeff: YOU KNOW, SO MANY OF YOU LOOKED SICK.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.999
YOU UPON, AIRFARE SAW EVERYBODY TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, I WAS A

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
LITTLE CONCERNED.

33:27.999 --> 33:31.999
SO I WANTED TO COME OUT WITH DR. RUPERT AND JUST KIND OF

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
ASSESS WHAT'S GOING ON.

33:32.999 --> 33:36.999
WE JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF YOU THAT SHOWED US THE

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
INFECTIONS AND SEE WHERE WE'RE AT.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.291
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS IT'S A REAL DEAL.

33:40.291 --> 33:41.999
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN CONTAIN IT.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.291
WHO DO YOU WANT TO START WITH?

33:44.291 --> 33:46.834
 START WITH TAI AND HIS THYSELF.

33:46.834 --> 33:52.291
 YEAH, I THINK I CLIMBED THE MAIPGO TREE, THAT LITTLE MANGO.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.999
 Jeff: YOU JUST GOT SCRAPED.

33:53.999 --> 33:57.000
 I COULDN'T MAKE IT AND SLID OUT AND SCRAPED.

33:57.000 --> 33:57.999
 Jeff: MAN!

33:57.999 --> 33:59.125
 IT WAS PAINFUL.

33:59.125 --> 34:02.999
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING MY UNDERWEAR EVERY SINGLE

34:02.999 --> 34:02.999
CHALLENGE.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.999
 Jeff: LET ME HAVE RUPERT TAKE A LOOK TAT.

34:05.999 --> 34:08.541
 I'VE GOT TO SAY THEY'RE HEALING UP REALLY NICELY.

34:08.541 --> 34:09.000
 Jeff: SO THAT'S GOOD.

34:09.000 --> 34:09.998
 THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT.

34:09.998 --> 34:12.998
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED BECAUSE YOU SEE SCABS FORMING.

34:12.998 --> 34:12.998
 ABSOLUTELY.

34:12.998 --> 34:16.998
AND I CAN'T SEE ANY REDNESS OR SWELLING SO I THINK THESE ARE

34:16.998 --> 34:16.998
REALLY GOOD.

34:16.998 --> 34:18.125
I THINK THESE ARE HEALING.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.998
 Jeff: TAI, YOU'RE GOOD.

34:19.998 --> 34:21.125
 I'M FEELING GOOD.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.291
 Jeff: SCOT, YOU HAVE ONE.

34:22.291 --> 34:30.998
 I'VE GOT A COUPLE.

34:30.998 --> 34:34.998
 Jeff: OH, MAN!

34:34.998 --> 34:35.958
 IS IT PAINFUL?

34:35.958 --> 34:37.291
 A LITTLE BIT.

34:37.291 --> 34:39.998
 IT IS QUITE NEWSCASTLY INFECTED.

34:39.998 --> 34:43.998
OUT HERE, SMALL CUTS TURN NASTY VERY QUICKLY.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.998
 Jeff: DO YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AT ALL?

34:45.998 --> 34:47.998
 WE'LL JUST KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

34:47.998 --> 34:48.998
 Jeff: OKAY.

34:48.998 --> 34:50.416
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AUBRY?

34:50.416 --> 34:51.998
YOU HAD A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

34:51.998 --> 34:52.998
 YEAH.

34:52.998 --> 34:55.708
 LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

34:55.708 --> 34:55.998
OH, LOVELY.

34:55.998 --> 34:57.998
 Jeff: WOW!

34:57.998 --> 34:59.998
MAN!

34:59.998 --> 35:01.998
 I CAN FEEL UNDERNEATH IT.

35:01.998 --> 35:02.998
IT'S FIRM UP TO HERE.

35:02.998 --> 35:05.998
 Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING UNDERNEATH THERE IT LOOKS LIKE

35:05.998 --> 35:06.998
IT'S THAT BIG.

35:06.998 --> 35:07.998
 YEAH.

35:07.998 --> 35:09.998
 IT'S BRUTAL.

35:09.998 --> 35:11.000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL OUT HERE.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.708
AND A LITTLE THING BLOWS UP INTO A HUGE DEAL.

35:15.708 --> 35:19.998
IF I LOSE AUBRY TO AN INJURY, THAT CHANGES THE WHOLE BALLGAME

35:19.998 --> 35:19.998
HERE.

35:19.998 --> 35:21.998
 Jeff: SO, WALK ME THROUGH THIS.

35:21.998 --> 35:22.998
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.998
 YEAH, I'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS OUT HERE.

35:25.998 --> 35:31.998
I COULD START HER ON SOME ANTIBIOTICS OR I COULD LANCE,

35:31.998 --> 35:39.998
INCISE IT, DRAIN IT, IF I LANCE, THERE'S ROOM FOR THE PUS TO COME

35:39.998 --> 35:41.998
OUT, BUT THERE'S ALSO ROOM FOR THE INFECTION TO GO IN.

35:41.998 --> 35:47.998
 Jeff: SO WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT?

35:47.998 --> 35:51.998
 MY GUT FEELING FOR THIS IS TO START HER ON ANTIBIOTICES.

35:51.998 --> 35:53.998
 Jeff: OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE CONSERVATIVE

35:53.998 --> 35:57.998
APPROACH, AND IF IT GETS WORSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO STEP TWO.

35:57.998 --> 35:58.998
 EXACTLY.

35:58.998 --> 35:59.998
 Jeff: ANOTHER ALL RIGHT, AUBRY.

35:59.998 --> 36:02.125
SO WE'LL GET AUBRY ON ANTIBIOTICS.

36:02.125 --> 36:06.998
ALL RIGHT, NEAL.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.998
 OKAY.

36:08.998 --> 36:12.998
 MOUNT SAINT NEAL ACTUALLY BLEW ITS LID THIS AFTERNOON AND

36:12.998 --> 36:16.708
A BIG CHUNK OF PUS CAME OUT AND REVEALED THIS GIANT CAVITY

36:16.708 --> 36:17.416
THAT'S NOW KIND OF OPEN.

36:17.416 --> 36:17.998
 OKAY.

36:17.998 --> 36:19.125
THAT'S NOT VERY PLEASANT.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.998
 AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING EVEN GROSS OR MY BACK.

36:21.998 --> 36:23.000
IT DOESN'T HURT THOUGH.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.998
 LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

36:25.998 --> 36:28.998
 Jeff: WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER THE ONE ON YOUR BACK?

36:28.998 --> 36:39.291
 A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

36:42.998 --> 36:46.998
 Jeff: YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE FIND A SPOT THAT'S CLEAN.

36:46.998 --> 36:47.998
 YEAH, YEAH.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.998
 Jeff: SO WE CAN SIT HIM DOWN IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT.

36:50.998 --> 36:54.998
 THE INFECTION ON MY BACK JUST LOOKS REALLY GROSS, BUT I THINK

36:54.998 --> 36:55.998
IT WILL BE FINE.

36:55.998 --> 36:58.998
IF MEDICAL TRIES TO PULL ME FROM THIS GAME, THEY ARE GOING TO

36:58.998 --> 37:00.998
HAVE TO LITERALLY DRAG ME OUT OF HERE.

37:00.998 --> 37:03.998
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT ARE, SO LET'S JUST WALK THROUGH THESE.

37:03.998 --> 37:05.998
HE'S GOT TWO INFECTIONS IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES.

37:05.998 --> 37:06.998
TAKE US THROUGH WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE.

37:06.998 --> 37:07.708
 ABSOLUTELY.

37:07.708 --> 37:08.998
 I FEEL GOOD, THOUGH.

37:08.998 --> 37:10.416
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, LAST NIGHT.

37:10.416 --> 37:11.998
 GOT EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP.

37:11.998 --> 37:12.000
 Jeff: YEAH?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.998
 AND WE HAD A FEAST RECENTLY.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.958
I'M GOING TO WIN SOME REWARD TOMORROW.

37:15.958 --> 37:19.125
 I MEAN, I'M LOOKING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT COULD

37:19.125 --> 37:19.998
POTENTIALLY BECOME.

37:19.998 --> 37:25.998
AND THAT ONE IS IN THE SKIN, BUT THERE'S NOTHING UNDER THERE I

37:25.998 --> 37:27.998
THINK WILL IMMEDIATELY BE DAMAGED.

37:27.998 --> 37:28.998
 Jeff: SO ASSESSMENT ON THIS IS WHAT?

37:28.998 --> 37:33.291
 IT'S A BIG, NASTY SPOT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S LIFE

37:33.291 --> 37:36.998
THREATENING.

37:36.998 --> 37:37.998
 I THINK HE'S OUT.

37:37.998 --> 37:39.998
 YOU THINK?

37:39.998 --> 37:40.708
 NO.

37:40.708 --> 37:42.833
 THAT'S WAY I'M LEANING.

37:42.833 --> 37:44.998
 I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

37:44.998 --> 37:47.708
 Jeff: ANOTHER SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.125
 I'M LESS WORRIED ABOUT THAT ONE.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.998
 Jeff: OKAY, LET'S SPIN BACK AROUND.

37:50.998 --> 37:54.998
AND WALK ME THROUGH THE KNEE AND LET'S SEE WHERE WE'RE AT.

37:54.998 --> 37:58.998
AND BEING CLOSE TO A JOINT LIKE THE KNEE, IS THAT MORE SERIOUS?

37:58.998 --> 37:59.998
 CORRECT.

37:59.998 --> 38:03.998
IF THE INJECTION GOES INTO THE JOINT, AN INFECTION IN A JOINT

38:03.998 --> 38:05.998
CAN DESTROY IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

38:05.998 --> 38:06.998
 Jeff: HOURS?

38:06.998 --> 38:07.125
 YES.

38:07.125 --> 38:07.998
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

38:07.998 --> 38:10.998
 I TRULY BELIEVE THIS WILL BE FINE IN A FEW DAYS.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.125
 Jeff: I BELIEVE YOU BELIEVE THAT.

38:12.125 --> 38:15.998
 BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IF THAT GETS WORSE AND IT GOES INTO YOUR

38:15.998 --> 38:17.998
JOINT, THIS IS FOR LIFE.

38:17.998 --> 38:19.998
YOU KNOW, THESE CAN AFFECT YOU YEARS DOWN THE LINE.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.833
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO RUN AROUND AND DO THIS WHEN YOU'RE

38:23.833 --> 38:23.998
JOE'S AGE.

38:23.998 --> 38:25.833
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.708
I THINK THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GET WORSE.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.998
 I LOVE THIS GAME, JEFF.

38:29.998 --> 38:34.291
 Jeff: NEAL, I CAN SEE YOU ALREADY GETTING EMOTIONAL.

38:34.291 --> 38:37.708
SENSING WHAT HE'S SAYING.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.998
SO, DR. RUPERT, LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR.

38:39.998 --> 38:41.998
ARE YOU PULLING NEAL FROM THE GAME?

38:41.998 --> 38:47.958
 I THINK I HAVE TO.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.998
 Jeff: YOU FOUGHT HARD.

38:49.998 --> 38:50.998
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

38:50.998 --> 38:54.998
YOU JUST PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO IT.

38:54.998 --> 38:56.125
SO WHAT'S THE FEELING?

38:56.125 --> 38:56.998
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAN.

38:56.998 --> 38:58.998
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL TO BE OUT HERE.

38:58.998 --> 39:02.291
 A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK TO COME OUT HERE.

39:02.291 --> 39:06.000
WATCHING THE SHOW IN THE SUMMER OF 2000, I WAS WORKING IN A

39:06.000 --> 39:06.958
CUBICLE.

39:06.958 --> 39:08.998
I WAS THOROUGHLY UNINTERESTING.

39:08.998 --> 39:09.998
I DIDN'T LOVE MY LIFE.

39:09.998 --> 39:12.833
SO I'VE HAD QUITE THE JOURNEY, JUST LIKE YOU HAVE OVER THE LAST

39:12.833 --> 39:16.998
15 YEARS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I CAN NOT ONLY COME OUT TO

39:16.998 --> 39:19.958
"SURVIVOR," BUT I COULD REALLY COMPETE.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.998
BUT IT'S BEEN A GREAT 19 DAYS.

39:21.998 --> 39:24.541
 Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM HERE, GET YOU INTO A

39:24.541 --> 39:24.998
PROPER HOSPITAL.

39:24.998 --> 39:26.998
WE'LL GET THIS FIXED.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.998
YOU COME BACK, YOU'RE A JURY MEMBER.

39:28.998 --> 39:33.416
YOU WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN, BUT YOU WILL HAVE A VOTE TO

39:33.416 --> 39:34.998
DECIDE WHO DOES WIN.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.998
SO I'M GUESSING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO

39:37.998 --> 39:37.998
EVERYBODY.

39:37.998 --> 39:38.541
 YES.

39:38.541 --> 39:45.291
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

39:45.291 --> 39:48.998
 YOU GUYS SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY, BECAUSE

39:48.998 --> 39:50.998
THEY'RE PULLING ME FROM THE GAME.

39:50.998 --> 39:54.998
SO IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY WITH EACH AND

39:54.998 --> 39:56.998
EVERY ONE OF YOU.

39:56.998 --> 39:58.998
 I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

39:58.998 --> 39:59.998
I'M SO SORRY.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.998
I KNOW IT TOOK EVERYTHING WITHIN NEAL NOT TO GET UPSET BECAUSE HE

40:03.998 --> 40:04.998
WANTS TO PLAY SO BADLY.

40:04.998 --> 40:08.125
AND HE JUST TOLD US HOW LUCKY WE WERE TO BE HERE.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.998
AND HE'S RIGHT.

40:09.998 --> 40:13.998
BUT, LIKE, REALLY SIGNAL MY NUMBER ONE ALLY.

40:13.998 --> 40:16.998
GONE.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.291
 BE WELL.

40:19.291 --> 40:23.998
 SO NEAL'S GOING, AND IT'S ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE WHAT ABOUT

40:23.998 --> 40:24.998
THE IDOL?

40:24.998 --> 40:27.958
AND I'M JUST HOPING HE WOULD GIVE MEET IDOL.

40:27.958 --> 40:31.998
 Jeff: SO, NEAL'S BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS.

40:31.998 --> 40:33.998
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.998
NOBODY FROM THIS GROUP GOING HOME.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.998
ONE IN 10 SHOT AT THE GAME.

40:37.998 --> 40:39.998
19 DAYS IN.

40:39.998 --> 40:42.998
ONCE AGAIN, THE GAME HAS CHANGED.

40:42.998 --> 40:44.998
 I FEEL BAD.

40:44.998 --> 40:48.416
 AUBRY WAS GOING HOME, AND THANKS TO SOME LUCKY MEDICAL

40:48.416 --> 40:51.125
EVACUATION, SHE LIVES FOR MAYBE ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

40:51.125 --> 40:52.998
 Jeff: TRY TO STAY HEALTHY.

40:52.998 --> 40:55.998
KEEP YOUR WOUNDS CLEAN.

40:55.998 --> 40:57.958
AND I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.

40:57.958 --> 40:58.291
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK?

40:58.291 --> 41:01.998
 I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE CRYING THIS MUCH ON "SURVIVOR."

41:01.998 --> 41:04.998
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS AND RIGHT WHEN I THOUGHT

41:04.998 --> 41:10.833
THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET SOME TRACTION UNDER US, MY BIGGEST

41:10.833 --> 41:12.291
ALLY IS OUT OF THE GAME.

41:12.291 --> 41:16.998
I GOT A NICE LITTLE BULGE ON MY LEG THAT EVERYONE GOT TO SEE.

41:16.998 --> 41:21.998
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, WITH NEAL GONE, THERE IS NO WAY THE

41:21.998 --> 41:25.125
BEAUTIES JOIN THE BRAIN AND THE IDOL WENT HOME WITH NEAL.

41:25.125 --> 41:28.998
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

41:28.998 --> 41:30.000
REALLY, NEAL LEFT ME HANGING.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.998
BUT "SURVIVOR" IS A PATH.

41:32.998 --> 41:33.998
YOU PAVE YOUR WAY BY YOURSELF.

41:33.998 --> 41:35.998
IT'S LIKE GOING ON THE OREGON TRAIL.

41:35.998 --> 41:36.998
YOU HAVE TO FORD EVERY RIVER.

41:36.998 --> 41:40.998
YOU HAVE TO CAULK EVERY WAG PON YOU HAVE TO GO UP THE HILLS AND

41:40.998 --> 41:44.998
DOWN THE HILLS, AND SOMETIMES YOU GET DYSENTERY AND DIE.

41:44.998 --> 41:50.998
YOU HAVE TO PAVE YOUR OWN WAY.

42:06.998 --> 42:08.998
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON "SURVIVOR," THE BRAINS ARE ON

42:08.998 --> 42:10.998
THE OUTS AND HOPING FOR A MIRACLE.

42:10.998 --> 42:15.958
 THE JOCKS AND THE PRET PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO SIT PRETTY

42:15.958 --> 42:16.998
FOREVER.

42:16.998 --> 42:18.998
IST WANT US TO BE CAREFUL.

42:18.998 --> 42:21.998
PARANOIA IS GOING TO KICK IN AT A CERTAIN POINT.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.541
 Jeff: IT ALL STARTS TO CRUMBLE.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.998
 IRRITATED CYDNEY WILL BLOW THE WHOLE GAME UP.

42:27.998 --> 42:31.833
 I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT TRULY BELIEVES THE JOURNEY IS

42:31.833 --> 42:33.998
THE REWARD, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL

42:33.998 --> 42:38.998
HOLD NEAR AND DEAR AND LOOK BACK WITH MANY SMILES AND MANY

42:38.998 --> 42:40.998
LAUGHS, MAYBE A TEAR OR TWO, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

42:40.998 --> 42:42.541
BUT THAT'S THE GAME.

42:42.541 --> 42:44.998
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST OUTWIT AND OUTPLAY.

42:44.998 --> 42:45.998
YOU HAVE TO OUTLAST.

42:46.305 --> 42:52.912
