00:02.001 --> 00:03.209
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.295 --> 00:04.957
It's the city. They're responding
to my article.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.255
This guy says that he saw DeVoe
at Fifth and Long two days ago.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.331
Yeah.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.541
This means DeVoe can't
hide from us anymore.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.342
<i>The injection of dark matter
from the thinking cap</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:12.635
which overwhelmed my synapses.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.805
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

00:15.891 --> 00:19.009
<i>DeVoe plans to position each
of his five satellites around the globe.</i>

00:19.102 --> 00:20.468
And when the satellites link up...

00:20.562 --> 00:23.805
He'll use that network to emit
a series of dark matter bursts.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.765
That will reboot the prefrontal cortex

00:25.859 --> 00:27.600
of every man, woman and child
on this Earth.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.981
We know we need a tech-free projectile

00:30.113 --> 00:31.445
to stop DeVoe's satellites.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.898
We've been looking for an object

00:32.991 --> 00:35.108
when what we really need is a person.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.318
Amunet.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.575
It will deliver
one savage concussive blow.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.330
But you only get one shot.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.624
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.871
Now, you want to rule it.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.203
I am leaving you, Clifford.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.640
Agent Diggle, good to see you, sir.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.894
- We have the specimen ready...
- The specimen?

01:05.274 --> 01:08.062
That's a man in there
who we are supposed to protect.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.141
Of course, sir.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.649
Our most powerful meta-dampener
is set on the building,

01:11.738 --> 01:12.899
I assure you.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.116
- Elvis Banana.
- Hendrix Spaghetti.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.657
- Eye scan?
- DNA sample, sir.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.408
Central City branch had some trouble

01:21.498 --> 01:23.581
with the transmogrifier
this time last year.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.785
- You're good to go, sir.
- Good.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.039
Now drop the dampener.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.330
Got caught in a blast.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.881
Slugger's microchipped now.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.629
Dampener scrambles the frequency.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.383
<i>Technical, this is Castellan.</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:39.839
<i>Lower the draw-bridge.</i>

01:45.063 --> 01:46.679
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.689
Modern music.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.070
So lacking in the harmonic resources

01:59.161 --> 02:00.948
necessary for expressiveness

02:03.874 --> 02:05.240
or profundity.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.250
The timpani in Handel's orchestra
weighed 140 pounds.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.003
The exact gravitational force
that I'm now exerting

02:14.259 --> 02:15.500
on your lungs.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.803
Music Appreciation 101.

02:23.268 --> 02:28.184
This evening's recital will be
conducted by your beloved professor.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.724
Who's there?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.528
My wife

02:36.406 --> 02:38.068
cared very little for violence.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.273
Stay where you are!

02:39.660 --> 02:40.650
Me...

02:42.371 --> 02:43.907
- Not so much.
- Light him up!

02:48.418 --> 02:49.625
Get him!

03:10.732 --> 03:12.143
Get out of my mind!

03:14.861 --> 03:15.851
Move, move, move.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.824
Man down!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.069
Hey!

04:09.124 --> 04:11.161
Come on. Come on.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.923
"DeVoe coming for Borman."

04:29.728 --> 04:31.060
And God said,

04:31.146 --> 04:33.183
"Let there be light."

04:41.323 --> 04:44.407
Okay, we got eyes on Cape Canaveral,
SpaceX and the Xichang Space Center.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.864
And Blackhawk Island.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.037
That's every launchpad
south of the 39th parallel.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.372
Good man.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.495
Okay, are we sure that DeVoe
is gonna launch

04:53.585 --> 04:54.746
the machine from an airfield?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.249
If he's shooting five satellites
into synchronous orbit,

04:57.339 --> 04:58.625
that's the latitude he needs.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.586
And whether or not he's still
moping around

05:00.675 --> 05:03.133
about his wife ditching him,
he's gonna resurface.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.210
He's gonna do it soon.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.048
When he does,
I whoosh, you whoosh, she bangs.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.136
If I can get there in time.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.559
I mean, I'm still not fast enough

05:11.645 --> 05:13.056
to make it through
DeVoe's pocket dimension.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.387
That's why we split up.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.771
Yeah, each one of us stakes out
a different launchpad.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.398
You're serious?
I mean, you've seen DeVoe in action.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.196
Yeah. The guy's a one-man
Legion of Doom,

05:24.324 --> 05:25.565
so send the Super Friends.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.983
Okay, but we're not at full
super-strength right now.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.569
I mean, Joe's got the baby on the way,

05:29.663 --> 05:31.450
and Caitlin's looking for Killer Frost,

05:31.540 --> 05:32.530
and Harry's...

05:36.837 --> 05:38.169
This chair came out of nowhere.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.167
So, hey, Allen. West-Allen.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.166
- Ramon.
- Cisco.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.588
Cisco Ramon, guys.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.554
Check this out, okay?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.849
Somebody has been blogging
about The Thinker.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.972
About DeVoe and the bus metas,
all of it, okay?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.598
And if we find this blogger,
we can stop The Thinker.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.146
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.394
That's... That's my blog.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.975
Look at the byline.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.062
It's not written by
Iris West-Allen, okay?

06:04.239 --> 06:09.860
It's written by Anonymous
Central City Citizen. Boom.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.910
- Mic drop.
- Hold on to that mic.

06:11.997 --> 06:12.987
It's imaginary.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.574
I asked you to proofread this
for me, remember?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.122
You asked me to proofread this when?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.997
This morning. That's when.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.082
When you said, "Harry.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.172
"Can you proofread?
Will you proofread? Will you read..."

06:28.305 --> 06:29.295
It's...

06:30.056 --> 06:31.922
Let's start by finding him a room
with less chairs.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.474
Okay. Good.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.143
- Powder on the floor?
- It happens.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.848
You have 400,000 new views?
That's amazing.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.182
I know, right?

06:41.276 --> 06:43.188
I mean, people have been
writing in from all over,

06:43.320 --> 06:46.734
sharing their theories
and reporting DeVoe sightings. It's...

06:46.865 --> 06:48.231
- And Marlize sightings?
- Yeah.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.657
I've been trying to track her down
for days.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.201
I know Harry thinks that they split up,

06:52.287 --> 06:53.653
but she's still
just as dangerous as DeVoe.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.329
Right. So what?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.330
Why would we send citizens after her?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.875
I'm all for telling people
the truth, but...

06:59.961 --> 07:02.044
Yeah, I mean, after I convinced you.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.338
Yeah, I don't know if it's the best idea

07:04.424 --> 07:07.007
to send people out there
to do our jobs for us.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.210
No, we're inspiring them, Barry.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.754
I mean, we could be the ones
to show them

07:11.848 --> 07:13.589
how to do the right thing.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.928
- I just got a new lead.
- Hmm.

07:20.982 --> 07:21.972
Fallout.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.487
So you think your psychosis
made a friend of yours disappear?

07:28.990 --> 07:32.154
Yeah, I mean, she's a really
good friend of mine,

07:32.243 --> 07:33.859
almost like a part of me.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.999
So your friend,
is she with us here right now?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.247
Oh, no, I'm not schizophrenic.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.626
Um, she's more like another personality.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.253
Dissociative identity disorder.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.881
That is usually caused by trauma,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.928
and from your history,
you've had quite a bit.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.098
Yeah, I did see my fiancÃ© die, twice.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.517
And then my next boyfriend turned evil.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.971
I actually meant childhood trauma.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.806
Tell me about your father.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.438
My dad? He was the best.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.236
Loving, supportive,
always pushed me to get smarter.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.484
And how did you feel when he passed?

08:13.702 --> 08:14.692
He had ALS.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.244
He was always hiding
his symptoms from us.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.908
He never wanted us to see him suffer.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.909
Sometimes when we're young,
we repress things that scare us.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.120
Oh, I'm not repressing anything
from my childhood.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.464
My missing friend just appeared
a couple of years ago.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.091
It's my adult life
that's got me like this.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.044
I'm so sorry. I have to go. Um...

08:35.222 --> 08:36.509
Do you charge by the hour?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.556
For you and your friends,

08:39.309 --> 08:40.642
the quarter-hour.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.806
I got a tip about Fallout, but it's
been scrambled by Kilg%re's code.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.392
Hmm. Not anymore.
Consider it unscrambled.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.440
Devoe. Where's A.R.G.U.S.
keeping Borman? Do we know?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.692
I can't ping Lyla, but I can try Digg.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.898
I'll just go get him.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.525
- Uh...
- Trash can.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.030
- How about the recycling?
- No.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.072
- No, I got it. I got it.
- Really?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.245
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.206
I'm sorry, man.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.705
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.462
Can we just... I'm sorry.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.464
I hate you. What is this about?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.508
Neil Borman, the man we left
with you, with A.R.G.U.S.,

09:16.598 --> 09:17.634
where are you keeping him?

09:19.309 --> 09:21.392
Barry, that's classified information.
I'm not the director of A.R.G.U.S...

09:21.478 --> 09:23.470
Digg, we don't have time, please.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.227
He's at a place called the Castle.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.942
It's 1,000 miles away from anything.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.232
Please, can you check it?

09:40.288 --> 09:44.328
Okay, looks like everything's fine
in A.R.G.U.S. except for me.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.574
Um...

09:45.668 --> 09:46.954
It says I checked in six hours ago.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.703
DeVoe can shape-shift.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.665
With Melting Point's powers,
he can trick a DNA scanner

09:52.759 --> 09:54.295
and take over the building.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.475
Hey, Diggle. Diggle, Diggle.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.226
Ten thousand rads and climbing.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.852
Borman's body's gone critical already.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.309
We can't save him.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.609
If that chamber hits 100K,

10:12.695 --> 10:14.231
it'll start generating nuclear fusion,

10:14.364 --> 10:16.071
like core-of-the-sun fusion.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.193
Infinite fuel.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.819
He's using Borman's body as a battery.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.693
That's the last piece of the machine.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.537
Wait, a battery? Borman's containment
cell is 10 feet tall.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.034
And DeVoe has the power
to shrink it down.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.034
It'll charge the satellites.
All he'll have to do is launch them.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.460
How long do we have?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.084
At this rate of fusion, we have...

10:34.134 --> 10:36.376
12 hours until the Enlightenment begins.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.098
Okay, Digg's back in Star City.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.429
Now, I'm going after DeVoe.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.389
Don't go storming the Castle just yet.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.977
You're looking at motion-activated
electroshock plates

10:54.112 --> 10:55.569
that A.R.G.U.S. installed
in the facility.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.817
Seventy thousand volts.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.398
You hit one of those,
you'll be knocked out for sure.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.983
So I'll avoid them when I go in.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.739
Okay, genius idea,

11:02.829 --> 11:05.947
if their placement didn't randomize
every couple of hours.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.282
So DeVoe is basically charging
his battery for 12 hours,

11:08.376 --> 11:10.584
completely protected
by A.R.G.U.S. defenses.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.003
And then he'll probably just jump
into a pocket dimension,

11:13.089 --> 11:14.170
and he's out of there.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.548
What if I don't avoid the plates?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.259
What if I hit them? All of them?

11:20.471 --> 11:22.087
I'm serious.
I mean, if I go into Flashtime,

11:22.182 --> 11:25.016
I could you use each plate's
electric current as a fuel source.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.309
Then I'd be fast enough to follow
DeVoe into his pocket dimension.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.303
You would get a serious boost.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.263
Again, another genius idea

11:31.399 --> 11:34.392
if hitting the plates didn't cause
an electrical explosion.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.319
Yeah, but I'd be through the pocket
dimension before the blast wave.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.445
Ready to blow up the satellite
on the other side.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.319
The satellite results came in.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.490
Okay. Oh...

11:45.663 --> 11:46.744
What? What is it?

11:46.873 --> 11:51.208
We got six plates and six heat
signatures above them.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.377
There are A.R.G.U.S. agents
still alive in there.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.795
He has hostages.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.337
You can outrun an electrical explosion.
They can't.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.586
How's he keeping them suspended
like that?

12:02.430 --> 12:03.796
I think I know how.

12:08.269 --> 12:13.981
Do you know what
my favorite thing about teaching is?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.484
Having a captive audience.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.366
I haven't moved from this spot
in three days.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.819
Baby, you're gonna have to carry me
into the hospital.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.496
Okay, so I got snacks.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.746
I got clothes for you.
I got clothes for the baby...

12:33.169 --> 12:34.330
Damn, I forgot something.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.538
Joe, we are not gonna need a katana
at the hospital.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.089
Okay, so you're in my head again,

12:39.175 --> 12:40.711
and it's entirely possible
that we get attacked

12:40.802 --> 12:42.293
by a samurai at the hospital.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.720
You have already repacked that bag
five times.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.968
You've read 10 different books
on birthing methods.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.048
By the way, I love the one about Lamaze.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.132
Yeah...

12:49.227 --> 12:50.889
Damn, where is this boy?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.096
You have already left Wally
a dozen voicemails.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.555
He's literally on a time machine.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.857
So he has no excuse
not to show up on time

12:56.943 --> 12:57.933
to meet his new baby sister.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.111
I'm sorry. It's just nerves.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.484
We have both done this before.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.987
There's not gonna be
any surprises, okay?

13:06.077 --> 13:10.788
- This is gonna be...
- Totally sick.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.539
Sick? Are you feeling sick?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.085
No, brah. No.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.418
This delivery is gonna be sick.

13:20.967 --> 13:26.338
Having this baby
is gonna be like one epic wave.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.176
Are you okay? You're scaring me.

13:29.434 --> 13:33.474
Far out! That's the 'za I ordered.
'Chovies and pineapple. Tubular.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.225
Tubular! Brah!

13:35.398 --> 13:38.436
There's your 'za.
That'll totally be $8.50.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.562
Thanks, brah.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.855
Hey, this house is...

13:40.945 --> 13:42.777
- Bitchin'. Yeah, everybody says that.
- No.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.864
Hard to find.
Those are some gnarly bushes outside.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.613
Let's crush some 'za, brah.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.411
Dude... Dude?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.169
Where is she?

13:59.672 --> 14:00.879
Where is...

14:01.424 --> 14:03.336
Uh... Where is she? I don't see her.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.302
No, Harry, I'm talking about
tracking down Marlize.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.720
If DeVoe has popped back up,
then she might too.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.047
And we need to put her in the pipeline

14:10.141 --> 14:11.632
before she causes any trouble.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.716
How are you tracking her?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.052
Well, my readers have sent in
hundreds of tips.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.138
Plus, there's facial recognition
and credit card checks.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.684
- Facts.
- Right.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.232
- Wrong.
- What?

14:20.318 --> 14:21.559
You're looking at facts.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.609
You should be focusing on feelings.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.939
You remember the Council of Harrisons?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.695
- I do.
- Handsome, but annoying.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.902
Well, they kind of taught me
that you if you wanna...

14:31.037 --> 14:34.201
If you wanna follow DeVoe's actions,
you gotta focus on DeVoe's motives,

14:34.290 --> 14:36.657
which is basically DeVoe's feelings.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.538
And so feelings,

14:38.628 --> 14:43.089
if you're Marlize DeVoe,
where are you gonna feel safe?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.336
So if I dig into her past,

14:45.468 --> 14:48.256
maybe I can figure out where she is now.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.551
Harry, that's really helpful. Thank you.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.675
Thank you, Iris West-Allen,
for saying that.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.767
I don't feel helpful that much anymore.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.726
So thanks.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.475
Hey... Um...

15:04.654 --> 15:06.111
Are you busy, Harry?

15:06.572 --> 15:07.938
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.025
Um... Would you maybe wanna
help me investigate?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.109
Yes.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.448
- Okay, cool.
- Okay, cool.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.997
- When?
- We're gonna... Right now.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.001
Hey, did you guys send an alert?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.421
We did. We think we figured out
how to stop DeVoe

15:24.507 --> 15:26.123
and save the hostages.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.333
What is it?

15:27.969 --> 15:29.380
Us.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.678
You bring us into Flashtime with you.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.395
Look, guys, it's great, you know,
you wanna help,

15:40.481 --> 15:42.063
but we can't split up in A.R.G.U.S.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.436
if I'm holding onto you the whole time.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.268
Well, survey says,

15:47.280 --> 15:48.396
you don't have to.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.856
You guys been researching me?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.533
At first, we thought you were
vibrating your molecules

15:53.619 --> 15:55.702
when we were in Flashtime, but that
didn't explain why we were conscious.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.450
Which gave us this brain blast.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.282
When you run, you don't just
tap into the Speed Force.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.500
You generate Speed Force around you.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.329
It's like you're creating lightning
to protect you from the friction,

16:05.423 --> 16:06.504
like an aura.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.423
So when I bring you into Flashtime,

16:08.509 --> 16:11.252
I'm actually extending my
Speed Force aura to you?

16:11.345 --> 16:14.133
And what if physical touch
just focuses those powers?

16:14.599 --> 16:15.715
I could let go,

16:16.392 --> 16:17.382
share my speed.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.639
We'd only be able to last
a few moments before we burned out,

16:19.729 --> 16:21.686
like 55 milliseconds of real time.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.513
And thanks to relativity, that gives us

16:23.608 --> 16:25.474
just enough time to rescue the hostages

16:25.568 --> 16:27.150
while you chase DeVoe
down the rabbit hole.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.646
Okay, guys, I mean, you know,
everything looks normal to me

16:30.740 --> 16:32.322
when I'm in Flashtime,
but it took me months to learn

16:32.408 --> 16:33.398
how to operate like that.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.779
Exactly.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.486
That's what makes you the perfect
candidate for training.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.196
Train us.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.284
I know it's a leap, Barry,
but we're running out of time,

16:43.377 --> 16:44.868
and I just think it might work.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.132
Okay.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.638
Ready?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.269
One second on the clock.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.306
Go.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.987
Oh, Flashtime, how I've missed thee.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.864
Here we go.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.195
Mmm, is that lightning about to hit me?

17:17.286 --> 17:18.696
You wanted to do this.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.036
It's working.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.163
Thank you, Speed Force.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.293
Okay, here we go.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.917
Just remember, when you're moving
this fast, it's not about

17:34.011 --> 17:36.173
running with your legs,
it's about staying calm,

17:36.264 --> 17:37.471
focused, centered.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.469
Otherwise, you're gonna fall
on your ass at Mach 3.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.051
Yeah, okay, sensei.
I'm just opening a breach.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.934
- You good?
- It's a little harder than I thought.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.640
- Yeah.
- Maybe if I shift my weight...

17:49.402 --> 17:51.689
Hey, you're burning up already.
You okay?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.522
- I can't move my leg.
- What?

17:55.616 --> 17:57.027
- My leg's not working.
- All right, stay calm.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.984
Remember, concentrate.
You're slowing down.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.195
Okay, I can't really concentrate.
I gotta keep it loose.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.996
I gotta keep moving
if I'm gonna breach, I mean...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.243
- You gotta stay calm.
- Okay.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.370
I gotta get the leg to move.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.328
- Now both of my legs are stuck.
- What?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.246
My legs are stuck.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.878
I'm working with two frozen
drumsticks here.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.800
- Okay, just relax.
- What? Okay.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.127
Now, I'm falling.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.632
You okay?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.267
Yep, yep, my legs are just asleep,

18:24.353 --> 18:25.844
but I'm gonna get this.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.304
- I'm telling you.
- Okay.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.356
It's Joe and Cecile.
Do you think I can spare a minute?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.945
I just gotta walk it off. Ah.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.364
We could use a break.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.068
Good news is, you're totally healthy.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.704
- Thank God.
- Oh, no, Caitlin.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.782
Please don't think, "Relax."

18:47.168 --> 18:48.750
If you were nine months pregnant

18:48.836 --> 18:50.953
and you suddenly started craving
Master Kush and Surf,

18:51.088 --> 18:52.204
I don't think that you would relax.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.291
Actually, I was thinking relaxin,
the hormone.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.751
As we get closer to your due date,
your body releases relaxin

18:57.845 --> 18:59.256
to loosen the ligaments

18:59.347 --> 19:00.713
to make it easier to deliver the baby.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.926
It's like you're literally stretching.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.055
So you think this hormone
is stretching her meta-powers?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.637
Yes, I think instead of just reading
people's minds,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.063
she's now inhabiting them.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.983
Great. That's great.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.811
I mean, that's just one more thing
for me to talk about at therapy.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.568
I mean, can you believe
what Dr. Finkel said this morning?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.316
Babe, we didn't see her this morning.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.651
Uh, I did.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.862
She thinks that
I'm repressing something.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.914
I mean, repressing something?
How crazy is that?

19:28.000 --> 19:32.711
Oh, my God, this Erlenmeyer flask
is covered in water spots.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.124
Yeah, she's definitely me.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.956
Uh, here, why don't I give you this?

19:36.050 --> 19:38.417
It'll help you
take some deep breaths and focus.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.844
I'm familiar with an albuterol inhaler.
Thank you.

19:44.809 --> 19:45.799
Oh, my God.

19:45.935 --> 19:46.971
Oh, oh.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.394
- I'm so sorry, Caitlin.
- Don't worry about it.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.937
You're just going off my instincts.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.515
How do we stop this
from happening again?

19:53.609 --> 19:57.068
I don't think we can
until you give birth,

19:57.154 --> 19:59.942
so I think the best thing to do
is actually keep you isolated

20:00.032 --> 20:01.364
and use this.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.862
Come on, we can handle that.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.362
Okay, I'm gonna get back to training.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.947
Thank you, Caitlin.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.283
Uh, hey, Caitlin.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.876
For what it's worth,

20:13.170 --> 20:15.332
when I was you back there
for, like, 20 seconds,

20:15.423 --> 20:17.710
it seemed like you were trying
to ignore something,

20:18.509 --> 20:20.796
something really big.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.468
And if there's anything that I learned

20:22.555 --> 20:23.591
from having these powers,

20:23.681 --> 20:27.049
it's that you cannot hide
from anything forever.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.602
You just be careful, okay?

20:36.527 --> 20:39.645
Marlize Milan, born in Cape Town.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.275
Cape Town.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.481
Summers by the sea.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.483
Picking grapes in a vineyard.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.696
Got a PhD in Inflationary Theory
and Engineering.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.914
Cute, little button nose
always buried in her book.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.783
So nice.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.955
Tenured as a professor
of engineering at Oxford,

20:55.045 --> 20:56.536
where she met Clifford DeVoe.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.667
Where she met her husband-to-be.
Isn't that romantic?

20:58.758 --> 21:02.001
A continent apart, and they find
each other. So romantic.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.756
I mean, it's beautiful
when you think about it.

21:03.971 --> 21:04.961
It's... What?

21:05.055 --> 21:06.717
Beautiful? What is that?
What are you doing?

21:06.807 --> 21:08.298
I'm empathetic. I'm being...

21:08.392 --> 21:10.224
Council says, "Be empathetic."
I'm empathetic.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.722
You know, I'm putting myself
in Marlize's shoes.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.099
I should see if she's got a pair
of shoes, put myself in them.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.934
No, Harry, this,
this is not a love story, okay?

21:18.152 --> 21:19.393
She married a psychopath.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.315
A psychopath now. Not then.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.155
Back then he had feelings.
They loved each other.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.574
He had feelings. She had feelings.
Then he lost the feelings,

21:26.660 --> 21:29.903
and that's why she got out.
That's why she left.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.238
She left.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.250
West-Allen.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.160
We should turn Marlize.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.704
Harry, no, I don't think you
even know what you're saying.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.590
I know what I'm saying.
I know. I have bad days.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.463
Dumb Harry. But I'm not dumb today.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.590
Today's a good day.
We should turn Marlize.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.046
Marlize can help us.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.881
And why would she wanna do that?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.557
To stop the psychopath.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.597
Right? And to protect the man
trapped inside the monster.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.974
Marlize can save everybody.
Marlize is the key.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.522
Harry, we've tried that already.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.353
With Savitar, remember? It didn't work.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.068
You can't save monsters.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.645
Marlize isn't a monster.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.773
And besides,

22:06.450 --> 22:07.611
the clock's ticking.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.943
I mean, 10 hours
before the Enlightenment.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.244
What do we have to lose?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.868
She stabbed me with a katana, Harry.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.915
Our lives are what we have to lose.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.500
We can't save anyone
if we're all dead.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.747
Right.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.376
We are gonna bring her in,
and we're gonna stop her

22:21.465 --> 22:23.548
so she doesn't hurt anyone ever again.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.171
Okay.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.553
I left some of my files at home.
I'll finish my investigation there.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.100
- I'm gonna come with you.
- No, I'm fine, Harry.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.552
- You stay here, okay?
- I'll come with.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.224
- Harry!
- I'll just stay here.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.935
I'll just stay right here.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.611
All right, just remember
to stay calm this time.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.821
- Why are you looking at me?
- I wasn't...

22:50.911 --> 22:52.368
Both of you.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.199
All right. Take two.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.080
- Yes!
- Nice!

23:03.674 --> 23:05.210
A baby breach.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.759
That's right, Barry. A baby breach.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.504
And in time, she'll blossom
into maturity,

23:10.598 --> 23:13.636
but for now in Flashtime,
she's my little breachling.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.841
Okay.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.301
Cait.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.396
Cold gun is still not working,
just like Killer Frost.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.307
We gotta find a way to offset
the friction.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.726
Damn it!

23:25.279 --> 23:27.020
- My leg's stuck.
- All right, just stay calm.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.942
Hey, watch out.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.035
Dad, my leg's stuck.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.746
Caitlin, watch out!

23:37.333 --> 23:39.199
- Caitlin.
- Cait.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.179
- What happened?
- Training.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.927
You came out of Flashtime in mid-air.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.303
I think you got concussed.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.850
Then again, I'm not the team doctor.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.020
I mean, I don't feel nauseous.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.730
Just hand me some acetaminophen,
and we can get back to training.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.806
No, hold on.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.355
We have to talk about what happened.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.853
What do you mean?
You just lost focus, right?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.234
- Yeah.
- No, it was...

24:10.824 --> 24:12.781
I don't know.
Something pulled your focus.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.408
No, I'm fine.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.031
If this were the real thing,
you would have died.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.704
- I'm not a liability.
- I know.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.620
I am. I'm putting you guys in danger
doing this.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.498
I mean, I realize you guys wanna
help, but I gotta stop training you.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.999
Barry, come on, those hostages...

24:26.090 --> 24:27.501
I'll find another way to save them.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.798
You have to let us help you.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.921
I mean, after everything DeVoe
did to us...

24:31.011 --> 24:32.218
Killer Frost.

24:32.346 --> 24:33.587
She's right.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.965
We're running out of time.
It's worth the risk.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.885
I'm not training you guys
just to get you killed.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.561
I'm sorry.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.656
West-Allen!

24:54.785 --> 24:56.367
West-Allen!

24:57.121 --> 24:58.953
- Of course, he followed me home.
- West-Allen!

24:59.039 --> 25:01.326
West-Allen!

25:02.584 --> 25:04.792
- West-Allen!
- Apartment five.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.327
Hi.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.455
Oh, you moved.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.960
- No.
- No, this...

25:11.010 --> 25:12.467
- This is apartment four.
- Four.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.051
- You're in apartment five.
- Yes.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.965
So, look, I just came to say
you were right.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.924
I was trying to put myself
in Marlize's shoes,

25:20.019 --> 25:23.057
and I forgot I should also try
to put myself in your shoes, so...

25:23.772 --> 25:27.140
Thanks. It's very big of you
to admit that you were wrong, Harry.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.728
I don't know if I was the word you
said. It's more like I'm dumb.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.028
I'm dumb now.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.321
- Harry.
- Yeah.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.528
Marlize is not gonna help us
fight her husband out of love.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.031
Love, exactly.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.111
Look, she...

25:40.205 --> 25:43.494
Look, the Enlightenment
was not born out of love.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.662
She's always been an activist.
Look at that.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.166
Even before she met DeVoe,
she was trying to save people.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.254
Yes, her earlier papers
were very optimistic.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.206
She thought that technology
could liberate humanity.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.417
Humanity. Right.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.297
But she's not saving anyone now.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.424
Not according to your perspective.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.557
What about her perspective?
Put yourself in her shoes.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.974
Come in, please.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.561
You know, just put yourself
in her shoes. Okay?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.513
- Harry, take your shoes off.
- Yeah.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.140
Yeah, put on my shoes,
and I'll put on your shoes.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.441
- We'll both trade shoes.
- No, Harry.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.564
I don't wanna try your shoes on.
I want you to take your shoes off.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.271
You're tracking mud all through
my house, please.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.736
Oh. Right. Sorry.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.860
This is kind of more of a loft...

26:20.954 --> 26:22.286
This is my home, okay?

26:22.372 --> 26:24.113
This is the first place
that I've lived in with Barry.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.956
It makes me feel loved and safe.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.784
And so we're gonna keep it nice and...

26:28.670 --> 26:29.660
Clean.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.832
What? What is it?
What are you thinking about?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.339
I think I know where Marlize is hiding.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.630
Apartment four.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.090
No, not apartment four.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.676
Babe?

26:45.854 --> 26:46.935
Babe?

26:49.608 --> 26:50.974
What are you doing?

26:51.068 --> 26:54.812
I gotta get this bag ready.
Uh... I got snacks. I got water.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.817
I got a change of clothes for the baby.

26:57.658 --> 26:58.990
I got a change of clothes for me.

26:59.827 --> 27:00.908
You're me.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.911
It's a whole new level of weird.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.159
Stop. Give me this.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.249
Sit down.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.622
Okay.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.178
Yeah.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.638
Better?

27:26.728 --> 27:28.219
Who the hell are you anyway?

27:28.313 --> 27:29.804
Okay, not better. I'm calling Caitlin.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.184
What are you doing in my house?

27:31.275 --> 27:34.188
- Cecile, this is our house.
- Cecile?

27:34.278 --> 27:35.940
Why do you keep calling me Cecile?
My name is not Cecile.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.154
I'm Joe West.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.489
Um... Okay, Joe. Joe!

27:40.951 --> 27:44.115
Joe, sit down. Sit down.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.281
Okay, I need you to take
a deep breath. In through your nose,

27:48.417 --> 27:50.124
out through the mouth. Close your eyes.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.204
Imagine that you're sitting

27:54.840 --> 27:58.504
in a big, beautiful sea.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.049
The waves are cresting over you.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.130
Back and forth.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.217
Those waves, that's Joe.

28:07.519 --> 28:12.310
Now, look up, it's a big, dark,
beautiful sky

28:12.691 --> 28:15.354
with one shining star.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.402
That star is you, Cecile.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.318
Great.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.567
How do you feel?

28:27.497 --> 28:28.487
Joe?

28:28.916 --> 28:30.373
- Oh, God.
- You pulled me back.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.246
How did you pull me back?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.035
Lamaze?

28:34.129 --> 28:37.088
I had to switch some things
up in my head, but... Hey.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.587
Am I crazy, because you were...

28:40.427 --> 28:44.296
Babe, trust me, there are far worse
heads I could have been stuck in.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.684
I love you.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.056
You figure it out yet?

28:57.653 --> 28:59.360
No, I mean, I shut down the generator.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.025
I could save the hostages,
but DeVoe still gets away.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.322
And then, you know...

29:03.408 --> 29:04.944
Actually, I meant,

29:05.410 --> 29:07.117
have you figured out how come

29:07.746 --> 29:09.533
you lost your damn mind?

29:10.082 --> 29:12.825
Dude, I'm sorry. I'm just...

29:12.918 --> 29:14.625
You're just trying to keep us safe.
I know.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.668
That's starting to sound real
familiar coming out of your mouth.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.293
You're not ready to use Flashtime.
Not like that.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.256
We will be ready if you train us.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.753
It takes more than 10 hours
to learn super speed. Okay?

29:24.846 --> 29:25.927
You guys could die in there.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.051
And if you don't take us,
we'll die anyway.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.009
Our brains get wiped, and that's it,
that's the end of our world.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.890
No, losing both of my best friends

29:32.980 --> 29:35.017
and it being my fault,
that's the end of my world.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.941
You may think it's worth the risk,
but I couldn't live with myself.

29:39.486 --> 29:43.981
Barry, you cannot sideline us
because of what happened to him.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.196
All right, I don't need
another therapist.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.156
Look, we all lost somebody, okay,

29:53.250 --> 29:55.492
but that never gives us an excuse
to shut each other out.

29:55.585 --> 29:56.701
I said drop it, all right?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.502
You think you're the only one
who feels bad about Ralph dying?

29:58.588 --> 29:59.578
Guys.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.460
You know, he came to see me
at Iron Heights?

30:01.550 --> 30:03.507
He told me he was afraid.
He warned me he wasn't ready.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.422
But I pushed him anyway.
I said go back out there

30:05.512 --> 30:07.299
and do my job, my burden.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.467
We made the bus metas.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.471
We gave Ralph his powers.
You wanna talk about burdens?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.182
I started this. I shot that bazooka.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.604
I opened up the Speed Force.

30:16.690 --> 30:17.976
And I didn't do it
so you could stand here

30:18.066 --> 30:19.978
and tell me you're gonna save
the world alone again.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.106
I know that.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.525
And I know we're running out of time.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.607
I can't do this by myself, but...

30:28.994 --> 30:31.202
Everybody I've tried to teach
has ended up worse

30:31.288 --> 30:32.324
than when I found them.

30:32.414 --> 30:35.248
And what about Ralph? Was he worse?

30:36.543 --> 30:39.251
You taught him that when his back
was against the wall,

30:39.338 --> 30:40.624
and the world was ending around him,

30:40.714 --> 30:43.957
he could always make the choice.
Make the choice to be a hero.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.668
We deserve that same choice.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.634
All we need is someone to show us how.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.889
You guys really wanna do this?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.437
It's not a burden
if we shoulder it together.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.903
- We found her.
- You found Marlize?

31:10.118 --> 31:11.575
I think so.

31:12.454 --> 31:13.444
She's in England.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.992
All right. That's our last extrapolator.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.079
You set the coordinates,
it'll breach you there.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.334
We have to stop DeVoe.
By the time you get back...

31:27.427 --> 31:28.713
Hey.

31:31.473 --> 31:32.930
I love you.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.508
Go save the world.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.343
I love you.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.809
Where are we at?

31:41.358 --> 31:43.145
Borman's almost at 100,000 rads.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.102
All right, we gotta go. Come on.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.990
Thank you, subject seven.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.993
Now, your fire will light up the world.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.206
Perimeter's secure.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.383
Once we're inside,
we'll have less than a second.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.131
I'll activate the plates,
draw their charge.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.211
I'll lay the breachlings.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.093
And I'll protect the A.R.G.U.S.
agents from the blast using this...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.216
- Ice shooter.
- Ice shooter.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.300
Do I have to call it an ice shooter?

32:18.395 --> 32:19.931
I thought frost bite sounded good.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.726
Guys, it solves the friction
offset problem by shooting ice.

32:22.816 --> 32:23.806
Therefore it's an ice shooter.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.186
- You call it an ice shooter.
- Relax.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.813
It's just not that hard.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.065
DeVoe must be
shrinking Borman's chamber.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.658
We can do this.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.506
Catch me if you can.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.612
I've got the charge.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.782
Breachling is go.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.406
He's iced.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.328
Five more to go.
Remember, stay focused.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.230
We did it.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.150
"Once upon a time in some remote
corner of that universe,

34:39.244 --> 34:41.281
"there was a star upon which
clever beasts

34:41.371 --> 34:43.829
"invented knowing."

34:44.498 --> 34:46.831
You're quoting Nietzsche at me.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.916
You destroyed a satellite.
Top marks, quick boy.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.379
You can destroy 1,000 more,

34:52.465 --> 34:55.128
and you will still march
closer to the Enlightenment.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.010
I forget what Nietzsche said
about wiping minds.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.587
I must have skipped
philosophy class that day.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.468
Did I teach you nothing this year?

35:01.558 --> 35:03.800
Has nothing pierced your thick cowl?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.598
Think of it. Or rather don't.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.055
You'll just end up hurting yourself,
so let me explain.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.607
A world, enlightened.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.652
Within a day all soldiers
will lay down their arms.

35:14.988 --> 35:18.322
Every nuclear weapon will be disarmed
within six months.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.659
Poverty, famine, disease eradicated.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.953
We will clean up the streets.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.908
People will put down their idiot phones
and become curious again,

35:28.001 --> 35:30.835
and I will be there to teach them.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.506
I, not you, will save this
godforsaken world.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.672
No, you'd just control it.
You wanna take away free will.

35:38.762 --> 35:43.006
A pittance for humanity to pay
to know peace.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.011
But we wouldn't know each other.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.472
Parents wouldn't remember their kids.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.978
Husbands wouldn't remember their wives.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.651
Good. You hit upon precisely the point.

35:56.196 --> 35:59.064
Emotion is the father of all error.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.150
Chemicals in our brain that distract us,

36:02.243 --> 36:03.609
impede progress,

36:04.496 --> 36:08.490
and the most destructive
and ridiculous imbalance of all

36:08.583 --> 36:11.917
is that thing you feebles call "love."

36:13.755 --> 36:16.668
I learned this from experience,
Mr. Allen.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.586
And soon, you will too.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.102
What happened in there?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.149
All that matters
is that you're all safe.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.443
But DeVoe. Where's DeVoe?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.521
Hey. Hey, don't worry.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.738
- The Flash is on it.
- Thank you.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.489
What's wrong?

36:48.665 --> 36:49.781
I need your help.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.830
Back when we were training,
I had this fragment

36:53.920 --> 36:55.001
of a memory.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.668
I think it's something that I've been
repressing for a long time.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.042
I don't remember much,
just that I was young,

37:01.344 --> 37:02.755
and I was terrified.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.514
Caitlin, are you sure you want me
to vibe you there?

37:06.599 --> 37:08.010
I mean, maybe your brain

37:08.101 --> 37:10.058
kept this memory under lock and key
for a reason.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.761
I need to know what it was.

37:11.855 --> 37:12.971
I can handle it.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.814
Then focus on it

37:15.900 --> 37:16.890
and hang on.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.655
Caity. Oh, no! Caity!

37:24.409 --> 37:26.651
Caity, are you okay?
Stay still, we're getting...

37:27.245 --> 37:28.326
That's me.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.654
- Right there.
- What are you doing?

37:29.789 --> 37:31.576
Caity! Honey, don't!

37:37.422 --> 37:40.381
Killer Frost, she was part of you.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.041
Even then.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.218
The particle accelerator
hadn't exploded.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.089
How is that possible?

37:56.733 --> 37:57.723
Empty.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.975
But this is their first place together.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.026
She would come here. I can feel it.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.448
The pot's still warm.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.238
That means...

38:09.245 --> 38:10.952
- We can have tea.
- No.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.660
- Marlize!
- Iris, she's not here.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.158
- Come out.
- Iris.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.994
It's rude to breach
into a person's home uninvited.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.047
And dangerous when that person's
holding a grudge and a katana.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.508
Why are you here?

38:25.929 --> 38:27.090
I got this.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.054
We're here, Marlize...

38:30.225 --> 38:32.842
We're here because of you.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.351
Because we... You...

38:37.857 --> 38:39.143
You've...

38:41.236 --> 38:42.352
I can't.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.981
You can't verbalize it. Not anymore.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.439
Just like we hypothesized,
but never observed before.

38:47.075 --> 38:51.410
You're experiencing the penultimate
stages of the Enlightenment.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.908
Your mind is being rebooted.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.788
Soon you'll be without memories,
without relationships.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.961
Just a blank slate
so that Clifford may reeducate you.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.299
Soon, we'll all be just like you.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.719
Marlize, we have to stop him.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.297
Your husband has gone too far,
and I think you know it,

39:11.391 --> 39:12.677
or you'd be with him right now.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.474
Yes, I left my husband,

39:14.978 --> 39:17.311
but that doesn't change the fact
that he's right.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.648
If anything, his betrayal proves
his very point.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.817
Man corrupts even the best of ideas.

39:24.612 --> 39:29.403
Pessimism isn't smarter than optimism.

39:29.951 --> 39:34.195
"In this life, the bravest thing
you can be is optimistic."

39:34.664 --> 39:35.745
Familiar words.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.949
You said them when you were at Oxford,

39:38.042 --> 39:40.625
two weeks before you met Clifford DeVoe.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.080
I gave a speech on technology

39:44.173 --> 39:45.789
and the elimination of world hunger.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.966
I truly believed it could be done.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.009
He tried to change you, Marlize.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.844
But I think deep down,
you are still an optimist.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.844
You still believe in humanity.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.516
And I believe in you.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.688
You asked me what I was willing
to do for my husband,

40:05.320 --> 40:07.232
and now I'm gonna ask you,

40:07.906 --> 40:09.863
what are you willing to do
for the world?

40:19.292 --> 40:21.079
Barry shot down one of the satellites.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.580
He did it.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.037
DeVoe didn't seem to care.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.791
I'll try and see if I can track...

40:26.382 --> 40:28.465
Uh, I don't like that sound.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.919
It says a S.T.A.R. Labs satellite
has been activated.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.003
It's DeVoe.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.510
He's using our satellite to replace
the one you destroyed.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.841
Well, can you stop him?

40:42.231 --> 40:43.688
He's here.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.397
<i>Hello, Professor DeVoe.</i>

40:48.738 --> 40:50.730
No, no, no. Come on.

40:52.909 --> 40:53.899
Come on.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.653
DeVoe!

40:59.499 --> 41:02.617
<i>DeVoe! DeVoe!</i>

41:03.670 --> 41:05.787
<i>Initiating Enlightenment protocol.</i>

41:06.881 --> 41:08.417
Let there be light.

41:14.764 --> 41:15.925
He did it.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.472
The Enlightenment.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.594
What are we gonna do?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.428
I don't know.

41:23.564 --> 41:27.103
God saw. It was good.
