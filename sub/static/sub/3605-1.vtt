00:08.426 --> 00:11.338
My brother Joseph and I
have had two families.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.298
The first one,

00:14.849 --> 00:18.012
well, let'sjust say
it didn't work out too well.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.761
But over the years,
we made ourselves
a new one.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.973
And it was
to this family,
all of you,

00:26.986 --> 00:28.226
that his heart
really belonged.

00:31.616 --> 00:32.856
You see,

00:33.951 --> 00:37.409
a family is something
that Joseph and I needed.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.575
lt offered us protection
from the outside world,

00:51.761 --> 00:53.717
what makes us
different.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.882
There are others
like us out there,

01:03.940 --> 01:06.807
in the shadows,
in the light,

01:10.529 --> 01:12.656
each grasping for
meaning in a world

01:12.740 --> 01:15.823
that won’t accept them
for who they really are.

01:16.369 --> 01:19.486
They, like us,
are blessed,

01:19.580 --> 01:22.071
gifted with
extraordinary abilities.

01:23.167 --> 01:28.287
And they, like us,
struggle with finding their
place in an ordinary world,

01:31.801 --> 01:33.666
haunted by their past

01:36.180 --> 01:39.718
from those who would
harm them and keep them
from their destiny.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.764
Every one of them
deserves a chance to
be who they really are.

01:45.481 --> 01:48.564
But to what end?
For what purpose?

01:50.820 --> 01:55.234
Here in this place,
we offer salvation.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.448
We offer hope.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.950
We offer redemption.

02:05.584 --> 02:10.795
And one by one,
they will come
to our side,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.134
to our family,

02:15.386 --> 02:18.128
and they will find
their way home.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.183
And all who have gathered
will be strong.

02:27.940 --> 02:32.980
And all who have gathered
will stand in unison.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.821
I say it's time
we found our way
back home again.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.249
Find your way home,
Brother.

04:06.831 --> 04:07.820
You must be
my new roommate.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.871
Yeah, I guess I am.
I'm Claire.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.871
Hi, I'm Annie.
It's nice to finally
meet you, Claire.

04:12.962 --> 04:13.951
You, too.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.128
The school,
they wouldn't release
any information.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.171
OthenNise I would have
friended you on Facebook.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.877
That's my fault. I always
check those little privacy
boxes for some reason.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.628
I did that same thing
with my AP Classmates
profile

04:24.723 --> 04:26.975
after I got a 8+
in AP physics.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.133
Are you on
APClassmates.com?

04:29.228 --> 04:34.063
No, I'm not in
advanced placement.
I got my GED.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.975
It's not because
I dropped out or anything.
I was just traveling.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.685
You got into this school
with a GED?

04:42.074 --> 04:43.154
What do your parents do?

04:44.577 --> 04:48.820
Uh... My mom breeds
championship show dogs

04:50.040 --> 04:52.372
and my dad works
for the government.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.658
So that's how
you got in
with a GED.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.037
No. ljust got
really good scores.

04:58.257 --> 05:02.671
Oh. Well, you'll probably
place in Fenten's linear
algebra class, then, today.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.796
Today?

05:03.888 --> 05:05.219
He only takes
35 students a semester,

05:05.306 --> 05:06.967
and the placement test
is today at 1:00.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.924
You get in and it pretty much
sets the whole dominoes
into motion, you know?

05:10.019 --> 05:12.886
So, what's your plan
for graduate school?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.683
I don't really have one.

05:14.899 --> 05:16.105
Guess that's kind of
why I'm here.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.649
No, you have to go
to college with the plan.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.484
How are you gonna
find your future
without a map?

05:20.571 --> 05:22.186
(LAUGHS) You have
a map of your future?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.608
Yeah.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.698
See, I call this
my trajectory.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.653
This is me in three years,
graduating magna cum laude
in poli-sci pre-law.

the youngest governor
in US history.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.215
Wow, you really
thought that through.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.927
Don't you think it's time
you put childish things
behind you

05:47.056 --> 05:49.889
and thought this through
yourself, Claire?

05:50.392 --> 05:52.929
I mean, don't let GED
be a lifestyle choice.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.013

make your own trajectory.

you and lwill have
a bright future together.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.098

I don't understand.

to take a chance.

we were just talking
in the hall.

58:55.199 --> 58:58.066
The next thing I know,
he's dead and this guy
is on me.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.616
I got lucky.

58:59.704 --> 59:02.036

it just...
lt kicked in on instinct.

59:02.123 --> 59:03.738
What are you
doing here, Tracy?

59:03.833 --> 59:05.824
I wanted you
to leave Danko to me.

59:05.918 --> 59:07.704
I couldn't
just let it go.

59:07.795 --> 59:11.162
I didn't know if
I could trust you
to deal with him.

59:11.257 --> 59:14.749
This is my life.
I needed to know.

59:15.803 --> 59:19.216
When I got here,
I saw that you did
what you promised.

59:20.099 --> 59:21.088
He didn't know me.

59:24.395 --> 59:27.512
So, I figured,
just live and let live.

this guy...

59:29.483 --> 59:30.984

59:31.861 --> 59:35.945
He was fast. Scary fast.
Definitely one of us.

59:38.868 --> 59:39.903
One of me.

59:40.619 --> 59:43.907
You have no idea
why he'd want
to kill Danko?

59:43.998 --> 59:46.910
I think I heard
him say he was
looking for something.

59:47.042 --> 59:49.294
I don't know.
Maybe it was revenge.

59:49.378 --> 59:50.879
Danko made
a lot of enemies.

59:50.963 --> 59:52.794
This wasn't revenge.

59:53.382 --> 59:55.168
Look at the wounds.

They're all
to the stomach.

59:57.595 --> 1:00:01.087
If it were me and l
was looking for revenge,
I'd go for the jugular

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:04.715
or the carotid artery
or the heart.

1:00:05.644 --> 1:00:08.636
No. I think
you heard right.

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:13.808
I think the killer was
looking for something.

1:00:13.903 --> 1:00:15.484
That's personal.

1:00:15.571 --> 1:00:16.651
And I think

1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:19.105
I found it.

What is that?

the right to know. Don't you?

1:09:58.945 --> 1:10:02.187
My life is simple, okay?
I understand it.

1:10:02.282 --> 1:10:04.944
I don't need for things
to get complicated.

1:10:05.452 --> 1:10:06.612
So, why did you
come with me?

1:10:06.745 --> 1:10:09.828
The ability.
lt'll help me do
my job better,

1:10:09.915 --> 1:10:11.951
the one where I actually
save people.

1:10:14.586 --> 1:10:16.702
I guess this is goodbye.

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:19.834
| wish you all the luck
in the world, Peter.

1:10:19.925 --> 1:10:21.290
Thank you, Noah.

1:10:23.220 --> 1:10:24.380
Hey!

Call your mother.

Knight’s Forensic Pathology

1:10:58.630 --> 1:11:01.417
Where did you get those?
The homicide bookstore?

1:11:01.508 --> 1:11:03.339
Is there such a place?

1:11:03.427 --> 1:11:06.169
Don't you think
you're going
a little overboard?

1:11:06.304 --> 1:11:09.011
Don't you want
to prove your roommate
was defenestrated?

1:11:09.516 --> 1:11:13.008
Of course.
And, yes, I know what
"defenestrated" means.

1:11:13.103 --> 1:11:15.765
Well, don't get mad at me
for using it in a sentence.

1:11:15.856 --> 1:11:18.518
Have you ever heard
of the "Jump, Push,
Fall" test?

1:11:18.650 --> 1:11:20.515
The what?
It's when cops
get a dummy

1:11:20.610 --> 1:11:22.601
the approximate size
and weight of the victim

1:11:22.696 --> 1:11:24.857
and they throw it
out of the window
to see how it lands.

1:11:24.990 --> 1:11:26.946
What page is that on?

1:11:27.033 --> 1:11:28.739
Oh. It's not in there.

1:11:28.827 --> 1:11:31.034
I saw it on an episode
of Crossing Jordan.

1:11:31.121 --> 1:11:35.535
Look, if you fail,
you go straight down.

1:11:35.876 --> 1:11:38.367
If you jump,
go a little further.

1:11:38.503 --> 1:11:40.368
But if you're pushed...

1:11:41.715 --> 1:11:43.046
Sorry.

1:11:47.429 --> 1:11:48.714
(MEOWS)

1:11:49.556 --> 1:11:50.636
Cranky.

1:11:50.724 --> 1:11:53.340
All we need is a dummy
the approximate size
and weight of Annie.

1:11:54.352 --> 1:11:55.558
You're not serious.

1:11:56.563 --> 1:11:59.680
Maybe we could
swipe a cadaver from
the medical school.

1:12:01.026 --> 1:12:03.733
What? It's
a victimless crime.

1:12:03.862 --> 1:12:06.148
Let's not get
carried away.

1:12:06.239 --> 1:12:07.570
Why not? This is murder!

1:12:11.453 --> 1:12:14.820
Maybe. But I'm not trying
to be a social pariah
before midterms.

1:12:15.957 --> 1:12:17.367
Ship's already
sailed, Claire.

1:12:19.044 --> 1:12:20.909
So, where do we
getourhands
on a dead body?

1:12:25.425 --> 1:12:26.505
Hi. My name's Matt.

1:12:26.593 --> 1:12:27.799
ALL: Hi, Matt.

1:12:27.886 --> 1:12:34.883
It's been six weeks
since I last used,
and I'm feeling confused.

1:12:39.105 --> 1:12:42.939
When I used,
I was totally selfish.

1:12:43.777 --> 1:12:50.444
I didn't think about
what I did to others and
how I may have hurt them.

1:12:51.117 --> 1:12:52.618
(CHAIR CLATTERS)

1:12:53.954 --> 1:12:56.616
Sorry. You mean like
what you did to me?

1:12:57.916 --> 1:12:59.452
Hi.

1:13:00.627 --> 1:13:02.413
My name is Sylar.

1:13:03.797 --> 1:13:09.133
It's been about six weeks
or so since I've seen
my body, and I want it back.

1:13:10.428 --> 1:13:15.593
Recently, there have
been these ghosts,

1:13:15.850 --> 1:13:20.640
these things have been
popping up from my old life
and haunting me.

1:13:20.772 --> 1:13:22.637
Do you really think
you're gonna stop
using your powers?

1:13:22.774 --> 1:13:24.059
Are you crazy?

1:13:24.150 --> 1:13:28.189
(LAUGHS) I mean,
I bet you couldn't even
make it through a day.

1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:29.816
I can't seem to
get these images
out of my head.

1:13:29.948 --> 1:13:32.815
You're weak.
You're simple-minded.

1:13:34.703 --> 1:13:37.035
I bet I can make you
use your powers.
Go away!

1:13:37.163 --> 1:13:39.540
SYLAR: I could make you
use your powers.

1:13:43.295 --> 1:13:44.705
I'm sorry.

1:13:44.879 --> 1:13:47.006
Hey, buddy, you okay?

1:13:49.801 --> 1:13:52.463
Does this guy look okay?
Seriously?

1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:57.047
(LAUGHS) I mean, he's,
like, 20 pounds ovenNeight,

1:13:57.142 --> 1:13:58.427
blood pressure's
through the roof.

1:13:58.518 --> 1:13:59.678
He's like a heart attack
waiting to happen!

1:13:59.811 --> 1:14:01.972
Stop it. Stop it!

1:14:05.775 --> 1:14:07.106
Um...

1:14:07.193 --> 1:14:10.481
Let's get things
moving along a bit.

1:14:10.572 --> 1:14:12.528

(CHUCKLES)

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:48.913
Let me take
a crack at this guy, see
if I can get him to talk.

1:15:49.003 --> 1:15:50.994
You seemed a little
off today at the meeting.

1:15:51.131 --> 1:15:52.746
No,no,no,no.
I'm good.

1:15:52.841 --> 1:15:56.129
You sure?
I'm good. I'm under control.
It's good.

1:16:00.181 --> 1:16:04.470
Double shot of mocha.
You look like you could
use a little pick-me-up.

1:16:09.274 --> 1:16:12.016
It's okay.
No strings attached.

1:16:12.110 --> 1:16:13.065
Not interested.

1:16:13.153 --> 1:16:14.518
Come on. Let's do
this easy, right?

1:16:14.612 --> 1:16:16.603
Just two guys talking.
Come on.

1:16:16.698 --> 1:16:20.486
| get it.
You are the good cop.
How ironic.

1:16:23.204 --> 1:16:27.197
(SIGHS) So, we need
a name, your supplier.
All right?

1:16:27.292 --> 1:16:29.533
You give us that name,
you keep a clean record.

1:16:29.627 --> 1:16:31.163
He's a liar,
totally lying.

1:16:33.006 --> 1:16:34.621
Why are you looking
at my forehead?

1:16:34.716 --> 1:16:36.547
(CHUCKLES) Does it say
"schmuck" or something?

1:16:36.676 --> 1:16:37.711
I wasn't staring
at your forehead.

1:16:37.844 --> 1:16:40.551
You're not getting
a name, coffee boy.

1:16:40.889 --> 1:16:42.004
Is that all you need,
Matt? A name?

1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:43.129
Seriously? What the hell
are you waiting for?

1:16:43.224 --> 1:16:45.931
It's gotta be floating
around in his comical little
brain somewhere, right?

1:16:46.019 --> 1:16:47.509
I don't do that anymore.

1:16:47.604 --> 1:16:48.593
You don't do what anymore?

1:16:48.688 --> 1:16:49.848
Why is that?
Because you're addicted?

1:16:50.899 --> 1:16:52.355
Leave me alone.
Who are you talking to?

1:16:52.484 --> 1:16:55.692
Just read his mind, Matt.
You know you want to.

1:16:56.529 --> 1:16:59.487
I could help you. I could
take a nice little chunk out
of his skull in the process.

1:16:59.574 --> 1:17:01.405
Stop it.
What's the matter
with you?

1:17:02.410 --> 1:17:03.399
Just give me a name, okay?

1:17:03.536 --> 1:17:05.197
Take it from him.
No!

1:17:05.330 --> 1:17:06.661
"No" what?
Why the hell not?

1:17:06.706 --> 1:17:08.742
Leave me alone.
You are a loser.
Total loser.

1:17:08.875 --> 1:17:10.581
No wonder your wife
is having sex
with the water guy.

1:17:10.710 --> 1:17:11.950
Shut the hell up!
I didn't say anything.

1:17:12.045 --> 1:17:13.034
I'm not talking
to you right now.

1:17:13.171 --> 1:17:15.332
Come on, Matt.
She's cheated on
you once already,

1:17:15.423 --> 1:17:18.836
and we both know
what Janice needs
is a real man.

1:17:18.927 --> 1:17:21.259
Someone who's not
afraid of power,

1:17:21.346 --> 1:17:23.086
someone who knows
what to do with it.

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:26.263
I'm in control here,
not the power.

1:17:26.351 --> 1:17:27.841
And not you,
you son of a bitch!

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:57.207
Oh. Yeah. I'm fine.

1:17:58.007 --> 1:17:59.918
Is that clam chowder?
It is.

1:18:00.051 --> 1:18:01.086
Smells good.
Where'd you get it?

1:18:01.177 --> 1:18:03.919
A place
called Legal Sea Food.
Got one for you.

1:18:04.055 --> 1:18:05.044
Never heard of it.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:06.758
It's up in Boston.

1:18:08.226 --> 1:18:09.762
Boston?
Yeah.

1:18:09.894 --> 1:18:11.179
How'd you get it
down here?

1:18:11.855 --> 1:18:12.935
I know a guy.

1:18:13.690 --> 1:18:15.681

That's the partner
I know and love.

till we're on duty.

1:18:41.634 --> 1:18:42.965
What? What?
What? What?

1:18:43.052 --> 1:18:44.917
(WEAKLY)
They took the compass.

1:18:56.149 --> 1:18:58.231
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

1:19:01.863 --> 1:19:03.694
Hi.
Hey.

1:19:04.657 --> 1:19:06.113
How are you?

1:19:06.492 --> 1:19:08.483
You know,
looks worse
than it feels.

1:19:09.329 --> 1:19:12.196
You called.
I figured I owed it to you.

1:19:12.332 --> 1:19:15.995
Hey, you know that key
inside of Danko?

1:19:16.502 --> 1:19:21.417
Turns out it led me
to a broken old compass.

1:19:22.175 --> 1:19:26.134
Your friend with the knives
just came and took it back,
anyway.

1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:27.676
You gonna go after him?

1:19:27.889 --> 1:19:29.049
I don't know.

1:19:30.350 --> 1:19:33.513
I prefer the old way
of doing business.
One of me, one of you.

1:19:33.603 --> 1:19:38.222
This new way just
feels too dangerous

1:19:38.900 --> 1:19:40.356
to try to stop
them alone.

1:19:42.528 --> 1:19:45.520
Maybe this guy
with the knives
is like me,

1:19:45.949 --> 1:19:50.238
just trying to get
their life back,
keeping what's his.

1:19:51.245 --> 1:19:55.864
Maybe the idea isn't
to stop them but to figure
out a way to help them.

1:19:57.877 --> 1:19:59.458
Yeah, maybe.

1:20:05.551 --> 1:20:08.042
(LAUGHS) So, be honest.
Why did you call?

1:20:08.429 --> 1:20:11.216
You know, I can't
call my wife, my...

1:20:12.225 --> 1:20:15.968
Ex-wife. I didn't
want to worry Claire.
So, ljust...

1:20:18.314 --> 1:20:20.396
I'm not sure...
I get it.

1:20:20.733 --> 1:20:22.109
You don't want
to be alone.

1:20:23.486 --> 1:20:24.566
Yeah, I guess not.

1:20:28.408 --> 1:20:30.319
So, what's in the bag?

1:20:33.246 --> 1:20:36.488
l have no idea.
What is it?
Is that clam chowder?

1:20:36.582 --> 1:20:40.746
It's still warm.
Looks like you have someone
looking out for you.

1:20:42.088 --> 1:20:44.249
You want some?
There's plenty.

1:20:50.805 --> 1:20:52.841
You got an extra spoon?

(LAUGHS) Hey, dude. Hey.

1:21:05.945 --> 1:21:08.607
You don't need
to jam it or else you'll
just bust the coil again.

your own strength.

you out, buddy.

of your own, Roy?

Maybe some day.

1:21:39.812 --> 1:21:40.801
Yeah.

Look, thanks for fixing
the hot water and all,
but...

1:21:43.483 --> 1:21:47.271
My pleasure.
Must be tough out there
for a single mom, right?

1:21:47.361 --> 1:21:50.853
Yeah, yeah.
Look, she's not
single anymore.

Tomorrow you're gonna
ask for a new route

1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:00.242
and you're never gonna
stop by this house again.

1:22:01.209 --> 1:22:03.825
So, I'm starting a new route.
Guess this is goodbye.

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:06.161
Yeah, it is. Bye, Roy.

1:22:09.509 --> 1:22:10.840
Gotcha.

1:23:13.072 --> 1:23:15.734
(PANTS)

1:23:36.804 --> 1:23:39.090
I guess she did
kill herself.

1:24:12.215 --> 1:24:14.001
You had me worried.

1:24:14.508 --> 1:24:17.671
Sorry. Getting the compass
back was a lot harder
than I thought.

1:24:18.971 --> 1:24:20.802
I met an empath.

1:24:25.061 --> 1:24:26.801
You talk to him?

1:24:27.647 --> 1:24:29.137
(LAUGHS)

1:24:29.565 --> 1:24:31.806
Didn't really
get a chance.

1:24:32.985 --> 1:24:37.695
Lydia says you found
another time traveler,
someone to replace Arnold.

1:24:39.325 --> 1:24:41.316
I don't like that word.

1:24:42.995 --> 1:24:45.077
You can't replace family.

1:24:46.666 --> 1:24:48.748
But the Chinese guy...

1:24:48.834 --> 1:24:49.994
Japanese.

1:24:53.339 --> 1:24:55.830
I put him on
a righteous path.

1:24:58.552 --> 1:25:00.679
But he'll come
back to us.

1:25:04.684 --> 1:25:06.220
So, what's next?

1:25:06.686 --> 1:25:08.426
We gather the rest.
