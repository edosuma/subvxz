in her room.

It sounds like
you're taking their side.

You can't blame them
for questioning your story

pulling your hair.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.120

A thing that happened.

But at least it's still
only three more days.

Was it a little risky?

did the talking.

Now we have to paint the mailbox
when we get home.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.150
Sorry.

08:31.150 --> 08:32.490
It just popped into my head

08:32.490 --> 08:35.220
when I saw the statue of liberty
holding that paintbrush.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.690
You know, what she used
to paint freedom in America.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.530
Oh.

Mm-hmm.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.230
Yeah.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.030
The key to a good lie
is keep it simple.

Well, why don't I stop talking

You wouldn't.

He'd love this.

used to call it "jeh-woh"?

I hate that I can't
share this with him.

to fly back for father's day,

09:42.060 --> 09:44.830

canceled our flight.

In spite of your thoughtlessness
and insensitivity.

Okay, those mean the same thing,
but okay.

Look, I just want you to know

15:36.100 --> 15:37.970
I understand
why you took your family's side.

And I am sorry
I put you in that position.

She left me something!
Aww.

Even though
you're stubborn and pigheaded.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.520
Okay, again...
Oh...

Manny's here.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.560
I had to bring him back.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.890
He was driving me crazy
with his googly eyes.

Guys, we have a party going on.
Let's take it over here.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.200
Now, Gloria,
you have admitted yourself

16:12.200 --> 16:13.840
that you have a history
of stealing things

from this one here.

anything right!

16:18.910 --> 16:20.540
You sound just like my father!

16:20.550 --> 16:21.710
Hold on.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.150
Are you saying that all this

16:23.150 --> 16:25.420
is about some weird competition
over your father?

16:25.420 --> 16:27.820
This is why you sabotage
my whole life?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.650
Because Papá loved me more?

16:29.660 --> 16:30.750
Don't love that.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.660
Oh, my god.
I guess so.

But I shouldn't treat you badly
because Papá choose you.

16:42.070 --> 16:44.500
It must have been hard
for a little girl.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.270
When you lose a love like that
at such a young age,

16:47.270 --> 16:49.910
you spend the rest of your life
trying to replace it.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.070

the hot-sauce business,

No, no.
Your jealousy is all I need.

I want to give you something
that is very precious to me.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.450
Not Manny.

It's something
that I should have given you

17:06.359 --> 17:09.290
that is gonna keep you close
to Papá forever.

I'd never get used to you.
