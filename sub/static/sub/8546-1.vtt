04:34.629 --> 04:36.337
<i>Allez avec bon Dieu.</i>

04:47.184 --> 04:48.382
Christophe!

04:54.817 --> 04:55.931
Christophe!

04:58.695 --> 05:00.901
Christophe!

05:02.365 --> 05:04.405
Christophe!

05:22.344 --> 05:26.508
<i>Field notes. Dr Dennis Alan,
Rio Negro Botanical Expedition...</i>

05:26.640 --> 05:29.262
<i>August 15, 1985.</i>

05:29.393 --> 05:31.682
<i>At the clearing of the
shaman An Hango...</i>

05:31.812 --> 05:35.680
<i>regarded as the most powerful
spiritual man in the Amazon.</i>

05:35.816 --> 05:40.230
<i>There's something strange in the air
today. Even my pilot's nervous.</i>

05:40.363 --> 05:44.693
<i>If I were superstitious, I'd say that
something was closing in on me.</i>

05:44.826 --> 05:48.661
<i>The shaman senses it too. He decides,
in his own off-the-wall way...</i>

05:48.697 --> 05:50.535
<i>to show me what it is.</i>

05:51.248 --> 05:54.748
Tell him I'm very appreciative.
Harvard thanks him.

05:54.877 --> 05:59.206
His potions will make a good medicine
that will be helpful for many people.

06:06.389 --> 06:10.055
Now he wants you to drink it. He says
he has something he wants you to see.

06:10.185 --> 06:13.435
You know what you'll see if you
drink that shit? Stars, amigo.

06:13.563 --> 06:16.101
Let's get outta here.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.740
Like I said, for the road.

06:34.544 --> 06:37.414
It's good. It's very good.

06:38.506 --> 06:40.545
Thank you.

07:19.256 --> 07:21.295
Agh!

08:23.321 --> 08:25.444
No! No!

08:26.032 --> 08:28.071
Stop!

09:05.573 --> 09:07.612
Hello?

09:10.870 --> 09:12.412
Julio!

09:35.936 --> 09:40.479
Hey. I thought
you'd taken off without me.

09:40.608 --> 09:43.443
I owe you one, pal.

10:01.004 --> 10:04.455
<i>Something much more evil and powerful
than the shaman or his men...</i>

10:04.591 --> 10:06.833
<i>has killed my pilot.</i>

10:07.969 --> 10:12.678
<i>I know this as clearly as I feel the
darkness and cold closing in on me.</i>

11:23.212 --> 11:25.252
Hey.

11:26.007 --> 11:28.878
Hey! Hey!

11:37.186 --> 11:38.181
Agh!

11:47.196 --> 11:51.241
<i>I'm only home for a week when I get a
call from my old professor and friend...</i>

11:51.367 --> 11:53.407
<i>Earl Schoonbacher.</i>

11:53.578 --> 11:55.986
<i>He's a consultant for a
pharmaceutical company...</i>

11:56.121 --> 11:58.873
<i>and says he has an
interesting job offer.</i>

12:03.545 --> 12:07.709
Ah, Dennis. This is Dr Cassedy,
the head of Boston Biocorp.

12:07.841 --> 12:10.297
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi, how do you do?

12:10.427 --> 12:12.301
Boy, it's a pleasure.

12:12.429 --> 12:16.262
I'm impressed. 200 miles
through the Amazon, on foot, alone?

12:16.601 --> 12:20.385
Not alone. They showed him
his animal spirit, his totem.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.476
The jaguar guided him
back to us, safe and sound.

12:23.608 --> 12:26.443
Well, we here at Boston Biocorp...

12:27.779 --> 12:30.400
we deal in science
and medicine, not magic.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.651
So whether you came by Jaguar
or Mercedes-Benz, who cares?

12:33.785 --> 12:37.450
What I care about is you came back
with plants and native medicines...

12:37.580 --> 12:39.620
that no one has
been able to collect.

12:39.749 --> 12:41.873
What do you know
about zombification?

12:42.002 --> 12:44.493
- Pardon me?
- Zombification?

12:45.506 --> 12:48.127
The process of making zombies.
The living dead.

12:48.259 --> 12:50.464
<i>Just what I've seen
on the Late Show.</i>

12:51.177 --> 12:56.338
This is the death certificate
of Christophe Durand...

12:57.058 --> 12:59.679
and the doctor's report.

12:59.811 --> 13:04.971
Mr. Durand displayed negative pulse,
no heartbeat, no respirations...

13:05.108 --> 13:10.399
no pupil dilation, no brain waves,
no response to pain, and he was buried.

13:11.699 --> 13:14.902
He was put into a coffin...
and buried.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.865
The date on that certificate
is seven years ago.

13:17.997 --> 13:23.287
This photograph was taken one week
ago at a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

13:23.419 --> 13:28.793
That man is Christophe Durand.
The same, and very much alive.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.590
Maybe Durand had a twin.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.178
No.

13:33.305 --> 13:36.009
Hospital error. You know,
right name, wrong corpse.

13:36.141 --> 13:37.090
No.

13:37.559 --> 13:41.508
No, we had it verified by Dr Duchamp -
the one who sent us the photographs.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.475
If you don't like "zombie",
choose another word.

13:44.607 --> 13:47.857
But the fact is that somebody
brought him back from the grave.

13:47.985 --> 13:50.274
And I wanna know...
how they did it.

13:54.241 --> 13:58.489
- You really believe this?
- The Haitians surely do.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.448
A drug.

14:02.584 --> 14:05.336
It has to be a drug then, right?

14:05.462 --> 14:08.035
Anesthesia.
That's what I was thinking.

14:08.173 --> 14:11.174
A new anesthetic that could
revolutionize medicine.

14:11.301 --> 14:13.922
Now, what if this zombie drug
could be discovered?

14:14.054 --> 14:17.220
40-50,000 lives a year
are lost on the operating table...

14:17.349 --> 14:20.634
not because of surgery,
but because of anesthetic shock.

14:20.769 --> 14:25.099
40-50,000 lives a year could be
saved in the US alone, Doctor.

14:25.274 --> 14:28.192
And more worldwide,
if properly marketed.

14:28.778 --> 14:31.316
It could be
more complicated than drugs.

14:31.447 --> 14:34.530
It could be the proof,
perhaps, of the soul.

14:34.950 --> 14:37.867
Come on, Schoonie,
where is the location of the soul?

14:37.994 --> 14:40.568
Under the hood?
Next to the battery?

14:40.705 --> 14:44.074
No, the soul begins
and ends with the brain.

14:44.209 --> 14:47.579
This drug, this is
something totally new.

14:48.339 --> 14:53.084
We don't have anything that can put
somebody in, then back out, of death.

14:53.719 --> 14:56.637
And all we gotta do is...
go and get it.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.474
<i>This is one of the
poorest countries in the world.</i>

15:05.606 --> 15:10.149
<i>It has revolution in the air. It's got
a ruthless dictator in the palace.</i>

15:10.278 --> 15:13.695
<i>So I had expected a certain
sense of oppression.</i>

15:13.824 --> 15:17.275
<i>But I hadn't expected that the
dark presence from the Amazon...</i>

15:17.411 --> 15:19.818
<i>would instantly
come over me here...</i>

15:19.955 --> 15:23.371
<i>as real as a cold hand
falling on my shoulder.</i>

15:23.959 --> 15:27.956
<i>And I also didn't expect
Dr. Duchamp to look like...</i>

15:28.087 --> 15:30.708
<i>Dr Duchamp did.</i>

15:30.840 --> 15:33.247
<i>- Dr Duchamp?
- Bonjour.</i>

15:34.218 --> 15:38.217
<i>- Bonjour, je m'appelle...
- Dennis Alan, I know.</i>

15:38.557 --> 15:41.474
Yes, I guess I am
an easy face in this crowd.

15:41.602 --> 15:44.271
Oh, I would have
known you even in...

15:45.063 --> 15:48.432
- Excuse me?
- It would be better if we talk inside.

15:53.113 --> 15:56.399
Those were the Tontons Macoutes.
They know you are here, of course.

16:06.294 --> 16:08.666
Are you sure handcuffs
are the best idea here?

16:08.796 --> 16:11.881
500 patients,
three doctors, 15 nurses.

16:14.135 --> 16:16.460
A week's supply of Thorazine.

16:17.472 --> 16:22.714
Handcuffs are the only thing Duvalier
makes sure Haiti has enough of.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.342
This is Margrite.

16:26.147 --> 16:29.148
- I was expecting...
- After an illness of three days...

16:29.275 --> 16:31.980
Margrite died and was buried
in a village ceremony.

16:32.111 --> 16:34.947
No death certificate,
but we have witnesses.

16:35.073 --> 16:37.065
That was 15 years ago.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.280
Last August, she was found
wandering in the marketplace.

16:41.412 --> 16:43.950
Her brother identified her
by a birthmark.

16:44.499 --> 16:46.788
A classic zombie.

16:50.713 --> 16:52.458
<i>Bonjour, Margrite.</i>

16:58.013 --> 17:01.714
<i>Est-ce Que Tu Te rappelles
Ce qui t'est arriv√©?</i>

17:13.778 --> 17:16.982
Well, she sure can't
tell us anything.

17:17.116 --> 17:20.900
I understand Christophe Durand,
the man whose death certificate I saw...

17:21.036 --> 17:23.444
he can speak, right?
- Yes.

17:23.580 --> 17:29.251
He even speaks English. Christophe is
unique. Much of his memory is intact.

17:30.004 --> 17:32.329
I'd like to see him right away.

17:35.259 --> 17:38.877
<i>A warning,
that's what I felt in those eyes.</i>

17:39.513 --> 17:43.179
<i>I didn't know of what,
but it chilled me to the bone.</i>

17:51.651 --> 17:56.194
<i>Marielle took me to see a man who was
very powerful in politics and in voodoo.</i>

17:56.323 --> 18:01.565
<i>He's a full voodoo priest, but he
also runs a nightclub for tourists.</i>

18:01.703 --> 18:06.116
<i>In fact, Lucien Celine does a bit of
everything, except give out information.</i>

18:06.249 --> 18:08.289
You've come on a good
night, Monsieur.

18:08.418 --> 18:11.170
Tonight the spirits are happy.

18:13.089 --> 18:16.209
We asked about Christophe Durand.

18:16.343 --> 18:20.590
Lucien, why are you being so difficult?
You have people all over the island.

18:20.722 --> 18:23.047
Someone must have seen
Christophe by now.

18:23.183 --> 18:28.308
Perhaps. But what people see and
what they say are very different matters.

18:29.356 --> 18:32.358
Haiti is full of
contradictions, Dr Alan.

18:32.485 --> 18:37.479
These dancers, for instance, they
don't bleed and they don't burn.

18:43.913 --> 18:48.374
Tonight we are calling down
Erzulie, the goddess of love.

18:48.501 --> 18:51.170
- You will dance tonight?
- No, Lucien, I will not.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.537
- You will.
- No.

18:54.549 --> 18:58.214
- You all right?
- You have business to discuss.

18:58.344 --> 19:02.258
If he won't help, we'll go
to Christophe's village tomorrow.

19:03.432 --> 19:06.517
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.082
Agh!

19:31.003 --> 19:33.291
Yes, he is the one to watch.

19:33.422 --> 19:38.926
<i>Captain Peytraud. He plays at
being a bokor, a black magician.</i>

19:39.803 --> 19:42.638
He is beneath contempt.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.932
He is the Chief of the Tontons
Macoutes, Duvalier's secret police.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.475
You have seen him
before perhaps, hm?

19:50.355 --> 19:53.724
- Yeah, someplace.
- Be careful, my friend.

19:54.401 --> 19:59.193
In Haiti, there are secrets
we keep even from ourselves.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.986
Hey.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.165
- Marielle.
- Yes, favorite of Erzulie.

20:48.122 --> 20:52.369
For Marielle, possession
is as natural as breathing.

21:15.985 --> 21:18.143
Argh!

21:35.838 --> 21:37.877
Watch it.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.425
Are you all right?

21:54.691 --> 21:58.025
<i>Marielle never mentioned what
had happened the night before.</i>

21:58.153 --> 22:02.614
<i>But from what I knew of possession,
she probably didn't even remember it.</i>

22:02.741 --> 22:05.492
<i>Maybe it was just as well.</i>

22:05.619 --> 22:10.197
<i>We asked in Christophe's village, but not
even the voodoo priestess would help.</i>

22:10.332 --> 22:13.286
I told you, he is dead.

22:13.418 --> 22:15.541
What should I know about the dead?

22:15.670 --> 22:19.751
<i>The whereabouts of Christophe remained
a mystery, until his sister found us.</i>

22:19.884 --> 22:22.457
<i>Le cimeti√®re.</i>

22:26.723 --> 22:28.763
Let's go.

22:52.041 --> 22:55.991
What his sister said makes sense.
Christophe is obsessed with death.

22:56.128 --> 22:57.291
<i>We will find him.</i>

22:57.421 --> 23:00.873
That's what you said
about the last three graveyards.

23:11.812 --> 23:13.851
Christophe?

23:17.401 --> 23:19.439
Christophe!

23:21.153 --> 23:23.193
Christophe!

23:35.878 --> 23:37.917
Christophe!

23:51.894 --> 23:55.263
Well, this is ridiculous.
Let's get outta here. A goat...

24:02.113 --> 24:03.691
Oh, shit.

24:03.823 --> 24:05.863
Are you OK?

24:09.078 --> 24:12.197
- They were just graverobbers.
- Graverobbers, huh?

24:12.331 --> 24:15.913
- That makes me feel a lot better.
- You should have seen your face.

24:16.043 --> 24:18.415
You think this is funny?

24:18.545 --> 24:21.796
Hey, let's stop
jacking around, huh?

24:21.925 --> 24:24.842
We won't find Christophe tonight -
if he's even alive.

24:24.969 --> 24:27.507
What do you mean "if"?
You saw the photographs.

24:27.639 --> 24:30.177
For all I know,
they were taken before he died.

24:30.308 --> 24:32.265
What are you trying to say?

24:32.393 --> 24:35.644
OK, you're my only contact
here in Haiti, right?

24:35.772 --> 24:40.683
First you let the evidence go, then
we spend a lotta time getting nowhere.

24:40.818 --> 24:44.069
Do you think I'm doin' this for
my health? I think this is a scam.

24:44.197 --> 24:47.781
I'm not blaming you. I've seen
the clinic. I know you need funds.

24:47.910 --> 24:51.575
But do you think Cassedy's corporation
will shell out money for nothing?

24:51.705 --> 24:54.706
- You think this is about money?
- Yeah.

24:54.833 --> 24:59.330
The way Schoonbacher spoke of you, it
was as though you could walk on water.

24:59.463 --> 25:02.547
Now I know why. Shit floats.

25:04.050 --> 25:06.671
<i>Yeah, well, why the hell
are you getting involved?</i>

25:06.803 --> 25:09.009
- Will you talk to me?
- Christophe!

25:18.983 --> 25:23.063
Christophe, it's me. Dr Duchamp.

25:24.738 --> 25:27.229
You remember me, don't you?

25:29.159 --> 25:31.199
I remember.

25:32.413 --> 25:34.820
This is Dr Alan.

25:34.957 --> 25:37.366
He's here to ask you
some questions.

25:37.961 --> 25:40.000
Christophe.

25:40.797 --> 25:45.424
I need you to remember
what happened before... you died.

25:48.263 --> 25:50.968
You spoke about it once to me.

25:51.099 --> 25:53.720
I remember... it all.

25:53.852 --> 25:57.386
The coffin, the... the burial.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.310
I... I saw it all.

26:02.652 --> 26:04.775
Were you sick?

26:04.905 --> 26:07.230
What was it that you felt?
The symptoms.

26:07.365 --> 26:10.699
I heard the dirt falling,
falling over me.

26:12.621 --> 26:15.028
The darkness pressed me down.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.285
He says the bokor,

26:25.286 --> 26:29.400
the one that made him like this,
beats him with a whip.

26:29.847 --> 26:32.682
<i>The bokor took his soul
and sealed it away.</i>

26:32.808 --> 26:35.560
He makes me do evil things.

26:36.812 --> 26:41.724
I'm no longer free.
He sends me into people's dreams.

26:42.610 --> 26:47.605
I'll need to... run a blood test
and I'd like to get a thumb print.

26:47.740 --> 26:52.236
- No, I cannot take him to the clinic.
- This is my place. Not with the living.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.528
He will find me.

26:54.664 --> 26:57.534
No, Christophe, you're not dead.

26:58.084 --> 27:01.619
Whatever they did to you, they did it
to trick you into thinking that.

27:01.754 --> 27:05.004
You have a good memory.
Tell us what you remember...

27:05.132 --> 27:08.299
<i>so we can stop the bokors
from doing this to anybody else.</i>

27:08.427 --> 27:10.883
Help us, Christophe.

27:12.890 --> 27:15.179
It's a powder.

27:16.186 --> 27:17.562
A poison.

27:18.146 --> 27:21.313
It run through the skin...

27:23.485 --> 27:25.525
to the soul.

27:36.623 --> 27:38.663
Christophe...

27:44.464 --> 27:46.504
Through the skin.

27:47.676 --> 27:49.716
A powder.

28:20.793 --> 28:22.620
<i>H√©, blanc.</i>

29:14.974 --> 29:19.636
Lucien. We need to ask for your help
one more time. We found Christophe.

29:19.770 --> 29:23.354
- He told us about the poison...
- Not another word.

29:24.276 --> 29:26.766
Let's go inside.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.904
If you blunder into this,
my people get hurt.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.735
The world should know
what is happening here.

29:32.867 --> 29:35.358
You see? She is an idealist.

29:35.494 --> 29:39.706
She simply does not understand how
dangerous these times have become.

29:39.832 --> 29:44.458
What I'm after is gonna save too
many lives. I'm not gonna back off.

29:44.837 --> 29:48.041
I know you know the man
that makes the powder.

29:51.303 --> 29:54.339
One name. Just one.

30:08.403 --> 30:11.156
The one in the hat
is our man, I think.

30:14.243 --> 30:17.363
- Louis Mozart?
- This is important?

30:17.496 --> 30:21.493
My friend represents powerful
interests, rich American interests.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.542
- American?
- That's right.

30:24.669 --> 30:28.288
They have an enemy they would like
to turn into a zombie.

30:28.423 --> 30:30.581
A zombie, huh?

30:30.717 --> 30:33.125
- That is all?
- That's all.

30:34.763 --> 30:36.803
$100.

30:41.771 --> 30:46.100
You've come to the right place.
Your enemy is as good as dead.

30:46.234 --> 30:50.730
I will catch his soul like a spider
catches a fly in his web...

30:51.030 --> 30:53.319
<i>and pop it in a canari...</i>

30:55.076 --> 30:56.274
like this one.

30:56.410 --> 30:59.661
You keep the zombie's
soul sealed up.

30:59.789 --> 31:02.660
It makes the flesh your slave.

31:03.627 --> 31:07.755
It gives you power.
You send it into people's dreams.

31:09.716 --> 31:11.673
Whose soul is that?

31:13.386 --> 31:15.628
This place's previous owner.

31:18.683 --> 31:20.759
Is that right?

31:22.520 --> 31:24.559
$100.

31:25.231 --> 31:28.268
<i>I cast a spell,
the coup l'aire, tonight.</i>

31:29.403 --> 31:31.941
It's not the spell that I want.

31:32.072 --> 31:34.693
What I'm after is the powder.

31:35.325 --> 31:37.614
The powder.

31:39.037 --> 31:42.869
Some say there is such a thing.
Some say it.

31:46.712 --> 31:50.128
I guess Celine was wrong. This guy
can't help us out. I'm sorry.

31:50.257 --> 31:53.841
Celine? Lucien Celine?

31:55.930 --> 31:58.338
Well, of course, of course.

31:58.474 --> 32:02.389
Lucien and me, we are like that.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.058
A man should help his friends.

32:06.857 --> 32:09.229
$1,000.

32:10.694 --> 32:12.651
$700.

32:12.779 --> 32:14.819
$400, tops.

32:16.784 --> 32:19.240
For Celine...

32:19.370 --> 32:21.244
$500.

32:22.081 --> 32:24.869
All right. Let's see what you got.

32:27.587 --> 32:30.078
I have some powder
already prepared.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.147
<i>You like it, blanc, huh?
It is beautiful.</i>

32:47.274 --> 32:50.109
Come in.

32:51.028 --> 32:55.322
With this powder,
you must be very careful.

32:55.449 --> 32:59.944
I make it so there
is no second chance.

33:03.456 --> 33:05.994
$500, huh?

33:06.919 --> 33:09.291
How do we know it works?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.912
- You want proof?
- Yeah.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.711
Marie!

33:24.770 --> 33:28.602
Don't worry. You have enough
for ten zombies, huh?

33:38.326 --> 33:40.698
Yes.

33:55.759 --> 33:58.927
You are very beautiful.

33:59.055 --> 34:01.511
Are you looking for work?

34:02.934 --> 34:07.513
He may keep you better,
but I will love you longer.

34:09.482 --> 34:14.358
<i>So you see, blanc?
No second chance. So, the money?</i>

34:14.946 --> 34:16.487
The money?

34:16.614 --> 34:20.992
That you get tomorrow, when I see
you raise the goat from the dead.

34:21.579 --> 34:26.157
I wanna see the goat alive again.
Zombies, remember?

34:28.753 --> 34:33.498
<i>It's too dangerous to wait at the hotel,
so we lose ourselves in the pilgrimage.</i>

34:33.632 --> 34:35.755
<i>And though I came for the powder...</i>

34:35.885 --> 34:38.719
<i>I'm getting into
something much, much more.</i>

34:38.846 --> 34:44.005
You know, I still have a hard time
putting you and all that stuff together.

34:44.141 --> 34:48.271
<i>I was brought up in the faith.
My father was a houngan.</i>

34:48.397 --> 34:51.018
I was dedicated to Erzulie at four.

34:51.150 --> 34:54.601
First ridden - possessed,
if you will - at eight.

34:55.487 --> 35:00.826
- There is beauty and compassion in it.
- Oh, yeah, I can understand that.

35:00.952 --> 35:04.237
- But you're a psychiatrist first.
- There is no conflict...

35:04.372 --> 35:06.614
between my science and my faith.

35:06.749 --> 35:09.703
You can give it whatever words
you will, but in Haiti...

35:09.877 --> 35:12.085
our God is not
just in His heaven.

35:12.214 --> 35:15.499
He's in our bodies, our flesh.

35:17.844 --> 35:20.798
There's something you should see.

35:29.606 --> 35:32.773
What is this ceremony?
Voodoo or Catholic?

35:33.026 --> 35:37.819
Haiti is 85% Catholic,
but 110% voodoo.

35:38.156 --> 35:42.106
For us, Erzulie and the
Virgin Mary are the same.

38:29.831 --> 38:31.872
<i>Blanc.</i>

38:42.678 --> 38:45.004
<i>Blanc.</i>

38:45.723 --> 38:47.929
<i>Blanc.</i>

39:49.622 --> 39:51.662
Are you all right, Dennis?

39:53.042 --> 39:56.991
Yeah. It was just a dream.
I had a bad dream.

40:25.325 --> 40:28.575
<i>She tells me this is one of
the cathedrals of Haiti.</i>

40:28.786 --> 40:32.321
<i>A place not only of great beauty,
but of great spirit as well.</i>

40:34.042 --> 40:36.285
<i>And maybe the place is magic.</i>

40:37.796 --> 40:40.204
These waters are healing.

42:36.917 --> 42:40.083
<i>WWBC in Miami reporting.
The word is official now.</i>

42:40.212 --> 42:42.538
<i>Responding to months
of demonstrations...</i>

42:42.673 --> 42:47.216
<i>the Duvalier government in
Haiti has declared martial law.</i>

42:47.345 --> 42:51.425
<i>Police and military units have imposed a
strict curfew from sundown to sunup...</i>

42:51.557 --> 42:55.804
<i>It was crazy. One minute
to be in such beauty and peace...</i>

42:55.937 --> 42:59.851
<i>the next surrounded by secret
police, the Tontons Macoutes.</i>

42:59.982 --> 43:02.390
<i>Strangest of all,
in the middle of all this...</i>

43:02.526 --> 43:06.146
<i>I couldn't get my mind
off the zombie, Christophe.</i>

43:06.281 --> 43:08.772
<i>Why would they do
such a thing to him?</i>

43:08.909 --> 43:11.578
<i>Why would they make
anybody a zombie?</i>

43:12.204 --> 43:15.407
Christophe was more than a patient
to you. You knew him before.

43:15.541 --> 43:20.499
No, but I knew of him. He was just a
grade-school teacher. No one important.

43:20.629 --> 43:23.334
But he wasn't afraid
to speak out for freedom.

43:23.632 --> 43:27.000
He was very much admired.
That's why they made him what he is.

43:27.134 --> 43:31.049
Instead of inspiring courage,
now he only inspires fear.

43:31.723 --> 43:34.475
Doctor Alan. Come with me, please.

43:37.396 --> 43:41.974
- Doctor Alan, come with me now.
- All right, just take it easy.

43:42.568 --> 43:44.856
I'll be all right.

44:24.027 --> 44:25.936
Ah, Dr Alan.

44:26.112 --> 44:29.066
- That's right.
- Why are you in Haiti, Dr Alan?

44:29.240 --> 44:33.783
Like it says there on the passport,
I'm a tourist. I came to see the sights.

44:34.329 --> 44:38.077
Yes, happy, happy,
happy island people.

44:38.208 --> 44:40.414
Then why visit an insane asylum?

44:41.336 --> 44:43.708
I'm an anthropologist.

44:43.838 --> 44:46.128
It's a tax write-off.

44:46.258 --> 44:49.129
I hope you're not with the IRS.

44:50.971 --> 44:54.803
Did you know this woman,
Marielle Duchamp, is a radical?

44:55.601 --> 44:57.677
So was her father.

44:57.811 --> 45:00.812
He was... misplaced.

45:01.565 --> 45:04.815
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

45:05.319 --> 45:09.815
So is this man...
Christophe Durand.

45:16.747 --> 45:19.831
- Christophe who?
- The man you met in the graveyard.

45:21.335 --> 45:23.493
Graveyard?

45:23.629 --> 45:26.879
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

45:27.174 --> 45:30.211
You're not a very
good liar, Dr Alan.

45:31.387 --> 45:33.426
Look, I'm a tourist.

45:33.973 --> 45:36.643
I haven't done anything wrong.

45:36.768 --> 45:39.093
Do you mind if I go now?

45:50.490 --> 45:54.025
This country lives on
the edge, Dr Alan.

45:54.452 --> 45:59.411
One weakness in the wrong place and
over it goes, back into slavery again...

45:59.541 --> 46:01.784
just like with the French.
- I'm not...

46:01.919 --> 46:06.995
The United States would like
anarchy here, I'm sure.

46:07.299 --> 46:11.083
Well, this isn't Grenada, Dr Alan.

46:11.219 --> 46:13.426
I'm here now.

46:14.014 --> 46:18.759
There are people like me who'd
make sure that doesn't happen.

46:22.105 --> 46:24.477
You remember that.

46:54.598 --> 46:58.760
You don't have to prove anything. It
wasn't a note slipped under the door.

46:58.893 --> 47:01.894
- We'd better wait another day.
- We haven't got another day.

47:02.021 --> 47:03.812
If we're outta the city, we're OK.

47:11.239 --> 47:13.943
Come, come, come, come. Come.

47:14.075 --> 47:18.488
We are celebrating my success!
This good fortune, huh?

47:20.624 --> 47:24.289
- So, how's the goat?
- Oh, business before pleasure, huh?

47:24.419 --> 47:26.459
The American way, no?

47:29.049 --> 47:32.252
You saw it die yourself,
but it walks.

47:41.938 --> 47:43.931
Nice animal.

47:44.065 --> 47:46.603
You like him?
I throw him in, no charge, huh?

47:49.987 --> 47:52.026
Americans.

47:55.784 --> 47:58.489
The money for the powder,
as we agreed.

48:10.425 --> 48:13.960
You see? Even in America,
they know me.

48:14.095 --> 48:16.171
They come for my work.

48:18.975 --> 48:21.976
You're an idiot.

48:28.318 --> 48:32.399
<i>My powders work. Maybe
I cast a spell on you.</i>

48:35.951 --> 48:39.201
You wanna know what
I think of your powders?

48:50.131 --> 48:53.167
<i>Careful, blanc. No second chance.</i>

48:53.635 --> 48:55.674
Dennis!

49:04.271 --> 49:06.311
It's piss.

49:08.359 --> 49:10.814
You're a dead man.

49:19.245 --> 49:23.374
Dennis, just what do you think
you were doing in there?

49:23.500 --> 49:27.996
We gotta stall him for a little time.
What do you know about radiator caps?

49:28.129 --> 49:30.965
What is it? Some macho death wish?

49:31.883 --> 49:34.041
My God,
what if it had been poison?

49:34.176 --> 49:37.794
It was. Rat poison, probably.

49:37.930 --> 49:41.133
Give me your hand. See your palm?

49:42.268 --> 49:45.352
See the coin? And...

49:46.189 --> 49:48.763
poof! Oh!

49:50.652 --> 49:52.858
See the poison he really gave me?

49:53.196 --> 49:55.272
Tricks of the trade.

49:55.407 --> 49:57.530
Here he comes.

49:57.659 --> 49:59.698
Wait in the car.

50:04.583 --> 50:06.955
You are still alive.

50:07.085 --> 50:09.125
Yeah, I noticed.

50:10.755 --> 50:14.339
I can make you it.
The powder you want.

50:14.468 --> 50:20.055
<i>No tricks this time, blanc. $1,000.
The zombie poison. The coup poudre.</i>

50:20.182 --> 50:23.634
- All right.
- But there are rules.

50:23.769 --> 50:26.224
You must make it with me.

50:27.772 --> 50:30.098
There is no other way.

50:46.375 --> 50:49.127
A strong work. Fresh bones.
Quickly.

50:51.339 --> 50:53.378
We work here.

50:56.636 --> 50:58.628
You start.

50:58.763 --> 51:02.133
Don't worry, they never
bury them deep here.

51:02.267 --> 51:05.054
That is why I use this place.

51:08.273 --> 51:12.852
- This isn't a kid, is it?
- No, no, this is not a child.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.069
No, no, no.

51:24.830 --> 51:27.405
A real prize, this one.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.124
A sorceress.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.709
When she lived,
she had great power.

51:35.592 --> 51:39.092
Now... she is just
easier to carry.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.314
Dennis?

51:55.863 --> 51:58.781
- It stinks.
- We will start tomorrow night.

51:58.908 --> 52:01.743
- Now, we get out of here.
- Let's go.

52:11.795 --> 52:14.749
I think I still have
some of my father's old shirts.

52:14.882 --> 52:17.718
- Maybe one will fit you.
- This shirt's fine.

52:17.844 --> 52:19.883
No, it isn't.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.761
Oh! No! No!

52:28.187 --> 52:30.310
Get in the jeep.

52:31.107 --> 52:33.265
Dennis!

53:04.098 --> 53:06.472
You've got a pretty face.

53:09.355 --> 53:11.893
The girls must like it.

53:12.024 --> 53:14.064
Do you like it?

53:16.904 --> 53:19.821
Your pretty white face?

53:20.658 --> 53:23.528
I asked you a question.

53:25.996 --> 53:29.033
Yeah... I like it.

53:31.628 --> 53:33.621
I like it too.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.056
I leave the face.

53:54.776 --> 53:56.816
You made your point.

53:58.488 --> 54:00.896
I'm on the next plane. I swear.

54:01.950 --> 54:05.117
It's not good enough now.
It's too late.

54:06.121 --> 54:08.160
You were warned.

54:08.790 --> 54:10.830
I warned you.

54:12.419 --> 54:15.455
I'm a US citizen.
Think about that.

54:15.839 --> 54:19.172
I don't see the ambassador here.
Do you?

54:22.138 --> 54:24.510
I'm in medical research.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.258
There's a lot of money in it.
There's plenty for you.

54:28.394 --> 54:30.434
I don't want money.

54:31.063 --> 54:33.305
Yeah? What do you want?

54:34.066 --> 54:36.937
I wanna hear you scream.

54:44.660 --> 54:47.033
Oh, no. OK.

54:47.289 --> 54:49.826
OK, OK.

54:50.875 --> 54:53.330
You wanna hear me scream?
I'll scream.

54:59.508 --> 55:01.548
Again.

55:04.972 --> 55:07.298
Not good enough.

55:27.746 --> 55:29.786
Dennis!

55:51.395 --> 55:54.598
<i>For three days, Marielle has
been my guardian angel...</i>

55:54.731 --> 55:57.732
<i>hiding me, nursing
me back to health.</i>

55:58.110 --> 56:01.943
<i>The wound Peytraud inflicted was
struck for fear, not injury.</i>

56:02.073 --> 56:04.481
<i>I'm alive, intact.</i>

56:05.368 --> 56:09.200
<i>She told me this morning that she
wants me to go before they kill me.</i>

56:09.330 --> 56:11.370
<i>But I can't do that.</i>

56:11.958 --> 56:13.832
Agh!

56:13.960 --> 56:17.127
You shouldn't be out here.
You shouldn't even be walking.

56:17.255 --> 56:22.676
Hey, this recipe took a thousand years
to get right. I wanna learn it.

56:24.304 --> 56:26.344
- Oh.
- Rest.

56:28.100 --> 56:32.429
He just went through the scrotum, right?
A little pain, a little terror.

56:35.565 --> 56:37.604
He scared me, OK?

56:43.948 --> 56:46.866
<i>The ingredients of the powder
are terrifically varied.</i>

56:46.993 --> 56:49.745
<i>There is the poisonous sea
toad, Bufo marinus...</i>

56:49.871 --> 56:52.445
<i>the same animal
Lucrezia Borgia used...</i>

56:52.583 --> 56:56.581
<i>made even more toxic by frightening
it with a stinging sea worm.</i>

56:56.712 --> 57:01.125
<i>And the puffer fish, which produces one
of nature's most powerful poisons...</i>

57:01.258 --> 57:03.002
<i>tetrodotoxin.</i>

57:03.135 --> 57:06.053
<i>Plus a whole pharmacy
of herbs, minerals...</i>

57:06.180 --> 57:10.427
<i>charred, then ground and mixed
with a skill that's astonishing.</i>

57:10.559 --> 57:15.435
<i>All this is woven together with a net
of magic beyond anything we know.</i>

57:28.077 --> 57:30.402
<i>The process will take
three days and nights.</i>

57:30.537 --> 57:34.072
<i>Already there is no doubt in my
mind that for all his joking...</i>

57:34.208 --> 57:37.956
<i>Mozart could give any Harvard
PhD a run for his money.</i>

57:42.008 --> 57:46.172
You cannot eat the powder
in food. That would kill completely.

57:46.304 --> 57:49.056
The flesh would never
rise to serve you.

58:07.493 --> 58:11.194
Squeeze. The bones
are brittle. It will come.

58:15.543 --> 58:18.792
This is the last. Soon, it is done.

58:20.255 --> 58:22.544
A good work.

58:26.678 --> 58:29.845
<i>It is a very frightening
thing, blanc.</i>

58:29.973 --> 58:32.809
The first time,
you can't tell good from bad.

58:33.144 --> 58:38.980
Then, after a while, it is
the very thing that sets you free.

58:43.487 --> 58:46.856
It must be buried with her
for one more day.

58:52.997 --> 58:58.289
<i>You want this enemy of yours pretty
badly, to go through such pains, blanc.</i>

58:58.879 --> 59:00.670
I'm all right.

59:00.797 --> 59:03.715
- Did he take your woman or money?
- No.

59:03.842 --> 59:07.887
Then why would you stand up
to a crazy man like Peytraud?

59:08.680 --> 59:11.716
Oh, yes. I hear these things.

59:16.646 --> 59:19.219
The poison's not for him.

59:19.357 --> 59:21.397
The poison's for nobody.

59:23.237 --> 59:28.397
I wanna use the poison for good,
to... help people who are sick.

59:33.497 --> 59:36.581
My poison can be used
in such a way, huh?

59:38.585 --> 59:40.910
Yeah, I think so.

59:41.046 --> 59:43.715
I think it can be known
all over the world.

59:43.840 --> 59:48.634
You will tell them about me? You will
tell them the name of Louis Mozart...

59:48.763 --> 59:52.049
and they will know
my work all over the world, huh?

59:53.935 --> 59:58.561
<i>All right, blanc. Come back in 24 hours
and you will have your powder.</i>

01:00:03.027 --> 01:00:06.810
<i>24 hours usually doesn't
seem like such a long time.</i>

01:00:06.947 --> 01:00:10.695
<i>In more relaxed times,
I've felt a day go by like an hour.</i>

01:00:10.826 --> 01:00:13.033
<i>But, as sweet as Marielle was...</i>

01:00:13.162 --> 01:00:16.662
<i>the day and night at the
beach house lasted a lifetime.</i>

01:01:01.712 --> 01:01:02.957
Dennis.

01:01:03.088 --> 01:01:05.046
Get outta here!

01:01:34.746 --> 01:01:36.786
<i>Dr Alan?</i>

01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:46.087
No!

01:01:49.802 --> 01:01:52.128
No!

01:02:05.443 --> 01:02:07.483
Agh!

01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:31.386
Marielle. Marielle.

01:02:31.512 --> 01:02:34.347
We gotta get outta here.

01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:02.282
Not this time, Doctor,
we're beyond that now.

01:03:19.978 --> 01:03:25.186
<i>These canari hold the souls of those who
were masters in the realm of the spirits.</i>

01:03:25.692 --> 01:03:28.064
Now their spirits serve me.

01:03:30.614 --> 01:03:33.864
She knows I'm telling the truth,
that such things are possible.

01:03:33.992 --> 01:03:36.993
I know the price you will pay
for what you have done.

01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:40.656
The photographs we took today
are quite convincing.

01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:45.418
If you return, you'll be tried for
the murder of Christophe's sister.

01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:50.006
The courts will take your life, but
that will be only the beginning.

01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:53.756
After you're dead...

01:03:53.887 --> 01:03:55.796
I'll take your soul.

01:03:59.394 --> 01:04:02.098
What'll happen to Marielle?

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.184
You go home.

01:04:05.358 --> 01:04:08.809
She's home. She's Haitian.

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:12.148
I have no reason to hurt her
once you're gone.

01:04:12.865 --> 01:04:16.116
Just... leave, Dennis.

01:04:17.328 --> 01:04:19.784
It is the only way.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:28.672
By the way, Dr Alan, what did you
dream about this afternoon?

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.255
The woman in your arms?
The sea at your doorstep?

01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:35.758
No.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.341
You dreamt of me and of the grave.
I know because I was there.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.847
And I can be there
every time you close your eyes.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:48.066
The pain I caused you
in the room upstairs...

01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:52.612
is nothing to the pain
I can cause in your own mind.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.326
Remember that, Dr Alan.

01:05:46.127 --> 01:05:48.797
You promised me $1,000.

01:05:49.923 --> 01:05:52.959
Did you forget your promise?

01:05:59.266 --> 01:06:01.343
No, I haven't got it.

01:06:01.477 --> 01:06:03.517
They took all my money.

01:06:04.272 --> 01:06:06.311
Well...

01:06:10.986 --> 01:06:13.311
take it anyway.

01:06:13.446 --> 01:06:16.198
<i>But you will tell
them about me, blanc.</i>

01:06:16.908 --> 01:06:19.482
You will make them know my name.

01:06:20.662 --> 01:06:22.868
I will.

01:06:23.331 --> 01:06:26.499
I'll let 'em know
you're a man to be trusted.

01:06:31.924 --> 01:06:34.961
On account, huh?

01:06:36.137 --> 01:06:38.176
Fair enough.

01:07:04.749 --> 01:07:07.584
- You used baboon?
- I put the powder in the palms.

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:10.664
It went into the blood.
20 minutes later they were dead.

01:07:10.796 --> 01:07:13.085
Or at least, they looked dead.

01:07:13.215 --> 01:07:15.457
My God, are these
numbers accurate?

01:07:15.593 --> 01:07:17.421
- Oh, yeah.
- The shift seems radical.

01:07:17.554 --> 01:07:22.928
It's triple-checked. These are
typical brain scans from our subjects.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.594
It's very focused. It targets
only certain areas of the brain.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:30.597
Air and vital functions:
Breathing, heart rate.

01:07:30.734 --> 01:07:33.355
Looks like somebody
turned it off with a switch.

01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:38.564
But in the areas controlling sensory
awareness, thoughts and emotions...

01:07:39.159 --> 01:07:41.319
bang.

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:43.910
So the animals know
what's happening to them?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.623
Yeah, the entire time.
A man would, too.

01:07:47.752 --> 01:07:52.628
You'd hear, see,
maybe even feel, think.

01:07:52.757 --> 01:07:56.706
But you couldn't do anything about it.
You'd just lie there, lookin'...

01:07:56.843 --> 01:07:59.797
Dead... and be buried.

01:08:01.223 --> 01:08:03.262
But you'd be alive.

01:08:04.059 --> 01:08:08.473
<i>And, I reminded myself,
the tests revealed the powder wore off...</i>

01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:13.102
<i>after 12 hours or so, leaving the
victim completely normal again.</i>

01:08:13.236 --> 01:08:16.403
<i>Except by then he'd be six feet
under in the airless black...</i>

01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:19.816
<i>clawing and screaming, with
no one to hear his suffocation.</i>

01:08:19.951 --> 01:08:21.990
Thanks.

01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:27.247
It's incredible
how rumor‚Äôs spreading.

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:30.993
It's unbelievable. The company stock
closed up a point and a half today.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:34.125
All based on rumor about
what Dennis brought back.

01:08:34.258 --> 01:08:37.212
- Thank you, darling.
- I'm just glad you got out all right.

01:08:37.344 --> 01:08:40.261
The news says
the whole country is in turmoil.

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.966
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:08:43.434 --> 01:08:45.759
We're kickin' around
a name for the product.

01:08:45.895 --> 01:08:50.555
I can't believe I employ people who
wanna call an anesthetic "Zombanol".

01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.983
I mean...

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:55.517
It's... really good.

01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:59.902
I gotta get some air. I'm sorry.

01:09:00.451 --> 01:09:02.823
Excuse me for a moment.

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.745
I'm sorry.

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:10.874
We need to talk.

01:09:13.212 --> 01:09:16.131
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

01:09:16.258 --> 01:09:19.212
I've been trying to call
for three days. There's no answer.

01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:22.679
- She could be away.
- Yeah. She could be in trouble, too.

01:09:22.807 --> 01:09:25.725
- I gotta go back there.
- Listen to me.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:30.810
There's a door to the mystical,
and you've just walked through it.

01:09:30.941 --> 01:09:35.685
Right now, you are very vulnerable.
I wouldn't go back to Haiti now.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:39.901
You'd be a grade-school boy
in a world of Nobel Prize winners.

01:09:40.033 --> 01:09:43.152
I'd stay as far away
from Haiti as I could.

01:10:03.139 --> 01:10:07.469
What you have done is a major
breakthrough. It's quite mind-boggling.

01:10:08.436 --> 01:10:12.815
The only thing I don't understand
is how did Christophe Durand survive?

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:15.018
How was he able to speak?

01:10:15.987 --> 01:10:17.445
Alex?

01:10:17.572 --> 01:10:22.648
Well, as far as we can tell,
somehow, I don't know how...

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:27.032
someone dug him outta the grave
so no brain damage occurred.

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:42.136
Is something wrong with your soup?

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:47.891
No. No, it's all right, I...

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.804
I'm not hungry.
- Albert?

01:10:52.356 --> 01:10:54.764
Dr Alan is finished with his soup.

01:10:56.694 --> 01:10:59.066
Perhaps monsieur would like
some salad instead?

01:10:59.196 --> 01:11:01.605
No, I, uh...

01:11:01.742 --> 01:11:04.659
I've been having
some stomach problems.

01:11:04.786 --> 01:11:09.164
Occupational hazard -
dysentery, botfly, malaria.

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:13.784
A toast? A toast?

01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:17.081
To Dennis...

01:11:17.215 --> 01:11:20.916
to his adventures,
and to this marvelous discovery.

01:11:23.639 --> 01:11:26.593
He rang to a... a new...

01:11:27.309 --> 01:11:30.226
to a new...
- Debra? Sit down, Debra.

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:52.913
<i>You're going to die.
You've been warned. You're going to die.</i>

01:11:53.795 --> 01:11:57.958
Debra, Debra.

01:12:29.455 --> 01:12:33.239
<i>He's gonna get to me,
wherever I am. I know that now.</i>

01:12:33.376 --> 01:12:36.045
<i>I've stolen his darkest and
most powerful secret.</i>

01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:40.500
<i>He'll want to get even and if he can't
get me, he'll go for Marielle.</i>

01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:46.046
Hey, I'm a US citizen!

01:12:46.223 --> 01:12:48.263
I'm a US citizen! Somebody!

01:12:53.772 --> 01:12:56.263
Hey, somebody!

01:12:59.904 --> 01:13:01.943
Lucien.

01:13:02.698 --> 01:13:06.317
<i>Lucien snatched me from under the
nose of the Tontons Macoutes.</i>

01:13:10.123 --> 01:13:13.538
<i>Marielle was safe. She was guarded
by his men at her clinic, he said.</i>

01:13:13.876 --> 01:13:17.660
<i>But for Mozart and me,
it was a different matter.</i>

01:13:29.016 --> 01:13:31.638
This will give you
some protection, that's all.

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:35.139
Just like your
scientific objectivity.

01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:41.062
In this country, I haven't felt
protected by anything.

01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:44.066
<i>You don't know what
hasn't gotten to you.</i>

01:13:47.244 --> 01:13:49.569
I'm not afraid for myself.

01:13:49.704 --> 01:13:52.374
A good thing. Up.

01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:08.594
Remember, when the battle comes,
it won't be fought in the streets.

01:14:08.723 --> 01:14:12.009
It will be fought
in your mind, in your soul.

01:14:13.979 --> 01:14:17.348
Marielle was right. This must end.

01:14:18.066 --> 01:14:21.816
These people,
Peytraud, Duvalier...

01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:25.948
They're not Haiti,
they are mad dogs.

01:14:26.826 --> 01:14:28.865
The madness must stop.

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:34.414
You're makin' a mistake. The president
and me, we are like this... like this.

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:48.885
Something's wrong, isn't it?

01:15:00.067 --> 01:15:02.985
We are in our spirits' hands now,
you and I.

01:15:04.572 --> 01:15:07.822
Remember, whatever happens...

01:15:08.534 --> 01:15:10.859
death is not the end.

01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:14.827
Lucien.

01:15:37.523 --> 01:15:38.722
Oh, fuck.

01:16:03.883 --> 01:16:06.291
Help me. Please, help me.

01:16:06.427 --> 01:16:08.467
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:58.811
Don't... don't let them bury me.

01:16:59.565 --> 01:17:02.056
I'm not dead.

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:19.500
Anything? Pressure? Pulse?

01:17:19.628 --> 01:17:21.667
Nothing.

01:17:24.966 --> 01:17:27.089
We've lost him.

01:17:30.221 --> 01:17:32.510
Write the time on the tag.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:38.059
- We'll notify the embassy tomorrow.
- No need for that, Doctor.

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.892
I've made all the arrangements.

01:17:43.151 --> 01:17:45.191
Whatever.

01:17:46.988 --> 01:17:52.575
He's dead. I trust somebody on your end
will take care of the proper paperwork?

01:17:56.665 --> 01:18:00.247
No, no, no. No rest.

01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:04.460
You'll see it all. You'll feel it.

01:18:04.589 --> 01:18:07.544
The cold in the coffin...

01:18:07.677 --> 01:18:12.220
it is worse...
much, much worse.

01:18:24.318 --> 01:18:28.013
<i>Lucien Celine, the great houngan...</i>

01:18:28.014 --> 01:18:30.744
<i>He serves me now, too.</i>

01:18:31.659 --> 01:18:35.110
Lucien can't protect you.
I hold him fast!

01:18:35.538 --> 01:18:38.622
Lucien will turn
your blood to worms.

01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:41.786
<i>Oh, yeah? Do you hear me, blanc?</i>

01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:44.707
Her head will be taken
as an offering tonight.

01:18:44.839 --> 01:18:47.164
No, wait.

01:18:55.808 --> 01:18:58.300
To keep you company.

01:19:53.368 --> 01:19:56.986
When you wake up, scream,
Dr Alan. Scream all you want.

01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:59.577
There is no escape from the grave.

01:20:39.373 --> 01:20:42.991
Ohh! Oh, God.

01:20:59.059 --> 01:21:01.682
Here!

01:21:02.647 --> 01:21:05.685
Here! Here!

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:12.229
Agh! Agh!

01:21:13.157 --> 01:21:14.817
Oh, God.

01:21:30.508 --> 01:21:32.548
You're alive.

01:21:33.219 --> 01:21:35.259
You're alive.

01:21:48.944 --> 01:21:51.151
I know it's bad, the poison.

01:21:51.572 --> 01:21:53.944
You see things the
living can't see.

01:22:20.476 --> 01:22:23.311
<i>This is WWBC in Miami reporting.</i>

01:22:23.479 --> 01:22:25.472
<i>We've just received
word from Haiti...</i>

01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:28.975
<i>that "Baby Doc" Duvalier,
his wife Michelle and his family...</i>

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.983
<i>are en route to the airport.</i>

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:33.437
<i>It's happening in the
middle of the night...</i>

01:22:33.572 --> 01:22:36.146
<i>and no one knows
what it means for sure.</i>

01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:41.450
<i>It is confirmed now the
Duvaliers are fleeing.</i>

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:45.365
<i>The scene at the airport was one
of barely controlled panic.</i>

01:22:48.671 --> 01:22:51.506
<i>Word is that revolution is
sweeping the country...</i>

01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:55.464
<i>as news reaches the
smaller towns and villages.</i>

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.645
<i>Libert√©! Libert√©!</i>

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.445
<i>- Libert√©!
- Where is your power now?</i>

01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:01.910
<i>The loas themselves
are having their vengeance.</i>

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.866
<i>Libert√©! Libert√©! Libert√©!</i>

01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:50.743
Your soul is mine.

01:24:54.508 --> 01:24:59.503
Get up, Dr Alan.
I control your thoughts now.

01:24:59.638 --> 01:25:01.678
Get up!

01:25:49.105 --> 01:25:51.976
Dennis! Dennis!

01:25:53.068 --> 01:25:54.859
Help me.

01:25:56.863 --> 01:25:59.069
- Marielle.
- Help me.

01:25:59.658 --> 01:26:02.031
- Help me.
- Marielle.

01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:08.330
Help me.

01:26:11.003 --> 01:26:13.043
Dennis.

01:26:14.298 --> 01:26:16.505
It's your fault.

01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:20.797
- It was your work...
- It was your work...

01:26:20.929 --> 01:26:26.849
that caused this.
- It was your work that caused this.

01:26:27.937 --> 01:26:29.645
Argh!

01:26:30.064 --> 01:26:31.855
Argh!

01:27:18.947 --> 01:27:21.272
Argh!

01:27:46.768 --> 01:27:48.807
Peytraud?

01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:22.132
Peytraud.

01:28:23.388 --> 01:28:25.427
Dennis?

01:28:46.745 --> 01:28:49.746
Argh!

01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:53.158
Argh!

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.371
Peytraud.

01:29:01.468 --> 01:29:03.959
- No.
- Help us, Lucien, please!

01:29:04.096 --> 01:29:05.045
No!

01:30:56.711 --> 01:31:00.839
Hold on a second. I'm not gonna
leave that thing in one piece.

01:31:21.403 --> 01:31:22.981
No rest for you!

01:31:23.155 --> 01:31:26.192
<i>No rest for you, blanc!</i>

01:31:26.326 --> 01:31:28.365
You're coming with me!

01:31:29.746 --> 01:31:31.952
You're coming with me to hell!

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:37.794
Son of a bitch!

01:31:39.254 --> 01:31:41.330
I'm tired of this shit.

01:32:14.207 --> 01:32:18.371
- What do you want?
- I wanna hear you scream.

01:32:25.593 --> 01:32:26.874
No!

01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:28.042
Yes.

01:32:49.535 --> 01:32:50.946
Den?

01:32:51.829 --> 01:32:52.943
Are you all right?

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:58.750
<i>- Libert√©! Libert√©! Libert√©!
- The nightmare is over, Den. It's over.</i>
