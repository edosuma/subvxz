00:05.744 --> 00:07.790
MAN: All right,
everybody on the ground,

00:07.833 --> 00:09.226
face down!

00:09.270 --> 00:12.012
Get your face down!
Are you deaf?

00:12.055 --> 00:15.015
Do you speak English?
Get down! You hear me?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.017
You got to lay down!

00:17.060 --> 00:19.280
Oh, you got a problem, huh?

00:19.323 --> 00:20.716
Get down!

00:22.544 --> 00:27.114
You put a dye pack
in there, Christine,

00:27.157 --> 00:30.117
I will kill your
entire family.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.206
Are we clear?!

00:32.249 --> 00:34.034
Are we clear?!

00:36.384 --> 00:38.255
Good girl.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.825
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:42.868 --> 00:44.131
I'm sorry.
Don't shoot me.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.394
You hit that silent alarm,
didn't you?

00:46.437 --> 00:48.178
Last mistake you'll ever make.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.051
Don't!

00:51.094 --> 00:52.356
Let's go.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.099
Let's get the hell
out of here!

00:56.143 --> 00:58.232
Let's go!

00:58.275 --> 01:00.234
Come on. Let's go!

01:00.277 --> 01:03.715
Start the engine!

01:03.759 --> 01:05.848
Let's go, let's go!

01:05.891 --> 01:07.589
Drive! Drive!

01:07.632 --> 01:10.461
I told you what would happen
if you messed with me!

01:10.505 --> 01:13.203
Relax. No one needs
to get hurt now!

01:18.252 --> 01:20.471
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:20.515 --> 01:23.518
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:23.561 --> 01:26.086

01:44.278 --> 01:46.106
Son of a...

01:46.149 --> 01:47.281
Did I burn the coffee again?

01:47.324 --> 01:48.673
No, it's not the damn coffee.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.110
But you did burn it.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.373
My landlord.
I'm getting evicted, man.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.765
Well, what'd you do?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.027
Why do you assume
I did something?

01:55.071 --> 01:56.203
I'm-I'm playing the odds.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.595
I'm the perfect tenant.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.771
He's turning the building
into condos.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.773
What? They didn't notify you?Claims he did.

02:01.817 --> 02:04.559
I never saw anything.
Now I got a week to vacate.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.735
Well, maybe it's a sign.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.389
What, that I need a good lawyer?No, that you need a change.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.478
You know? I mean, you're always
saying that that place

02:10.521 --> 02:11.783
was too much for one person.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.176
You said that the noise
from the French Quarter

02:13.220 --> 02:14.395
at night was driving you...No.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.918
No, I say a lot of
things, Sebastian.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.398
I don't know,
wouldn't it be nice

02:17.441 --> 02:19.008
to just live somewhere quieter?

02:19.051 --> 02:20.401
Get more sleep.

02:20.444 --> 02:23.708
Be less grumpy,
then everybody wins.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.928
You want your face burned, too?

02:25.971 --> 02:29.279
Whoa. Play nice,
or I'll separate you two.

02:29.323 --> 02:32.369
She started it.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.805
Casual Tuesday at Belle Chasse?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.720
I'm designated hitter

02:35.764 --> 02:37.592
while Hannah spends time
with her family.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.289
Figured you guys
could use some help.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.509
Or a referee.

02:41.552 --> 02:44.294
It's the FBI.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.166
Armed Forces Navy Credit Union
was robbed this morning.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.777
They got a body
to go with it.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.827
Lasalle was first on
the scene with the FBI.

02:55.871 --> 02:58.047
I'll see what he's got.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.875
WADE:
Dwayne.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.878
You're not surprised
to see me, Loretta?

03:02.921 --> 03:04.314
With Hannah out,
I knew you'd

03:04.358 --> 03:06.882
jump at the chance to get back
into the squad room.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.884
Well, it's temporary, but...

03:08.927 --> 03:10.973
Everything in life's temporary.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.236
Sadly, our victim
learned that this morning.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.935
Who is he?It's Assistant Bank
Manager Nelson Deets.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.154
Navy reservist.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.331
Single GSW?

03:21.375 --> 03:22.811
Yes. Nine millimeter.

03:22.854 --> 03:25.335
Went beneath the teres
major muscle.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.167
I'd say he was trying to run.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.995
Yes. Got shot in the back.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.998
King. It's good to have you
back in the field.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.000
Thank you, Christopher.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.960
What do we know?Two-man takedown team

03:42.004 --> 03:43.788
with a getaway driver outside.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.226
FBI pulled the security footage.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.099
Clowns?
GREGORIO: They jumped Deets

03:50.142 --> 03:52.362
while he was unlocking
the rear employee entrance.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.972
Yeah, they got away
with the front house cash.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.191
About 30 grand.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.453
I'm guessing
Deets was killed

03:56.497 --> 03:57.889
when they tried
to raid the vault.

03:57.933 --> 04:01.153
But without the surveillance
footage, can't be sure.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.851
Other cameras weren't working?

04:02.894 --> 04:04.331
SEBASTIAN: Oh, they were,
until the smaller clown

04:04.374 --> 04:05.549
shot 'em all out.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.029
One round per camera.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.813
We're looking for someone
who can shoot.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.163
Well, there's paint
from the security dye pack.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.817
LASALLE: It's probably
what got Deets killed.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.820
He must have steered the robbers
to a specific deposit box.

04:15.864 --> 04:19.215
When they tried to remove the
rigged money from the vault...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.173
Boom. Jackson Pollock.

04:21.217 --> 04:26.266
You know, dye packs explode at
almost 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.311
That's hot enough to
cause severe burns,

04:28.355 --> 04:30.008
even through fabric.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.184
I might be able to pull DNA
from these fibers.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.665
Well, get that to the lab,
Sebastian.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.886
Gregorio, Lasalle,
canvass the area.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.409
Somebody must have seen

04:39.453 --> 04:41.106
that clown car race off.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.717
Let's hunt down this crew.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.979
Find our killer.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.332
I miss something?

04:49.376 --> 04:50.855
Well, you know,
Hannah usually...

04:50.899 --> 04:53.118
She says please when
she gives us orders, but...

04:53.162 --> 04:54.946
Well, get the hell
out of here... please.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.035
Yes. All right.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.475
GREGORIO:
Got it, boss. See you soon.

05:01.518 --> 05:04.216
Pride and the FBI
found the getaway car

05:04.260 --> 05:06.393
in a drainage ditch near Gretna.Any evidence?

05:06.436 --> 05:08.873
FBI techs are looking now,
but the car was torched.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.398
So not likely. The crew didn't
leave anything to chance.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.964
SEBASTIAN:
They left something behind.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.924
Skin cells charred to the
burnt fabric from the bank.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.142
Tell me you got a CODIS hit.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.492
I did, and this clown,

05:18.535 --> 05:20.363
he's less Bozo
and more Pennywise.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.843
Check it out.
John Manning.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.932
Just added to the FBI's
Most Wanted list

05:23.975 --> 05:25.368
three days ago
after he escaped

05:25.412 --> 05:26.978
Riverbend Max
outside of Nashville.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.416
Most of his arrests are
narcotics distribution,

05:29.459 --> 05:30.852
weapons possession.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.375
Armed robbery is outside
his M.O.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.985
Murder's not.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.597
Looks like he killed a C.O.
during his escape

05:36.640 --> 05:38.338
and shot a highway patrolman.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.513
Desperate men
do desperate things.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.123
Maybe Manning and
his accomplices are

05:41.166 --> 05:43.255
trying to score enough cash
to flee the country.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.083
Why come all the way from
Nashville to New Orleans

05:45.127 --> 05:46.607
just to rob a bank?

05:46.650 --> 05:49.827
Maybe money's not the only
reason he came back to town.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.351
I'll check
known associates.

05:51.394 --> 05:55.442
Okay, Manning's ex-fiancée,
Ashley Elwood,

05:55.485 --> 05:58.401
moved to Plaquemines Parish
after he went to prison.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.099
Oh, she got herself
a nice little rap sheet, too.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.319
Multiple arrests,
including narcotics.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.974
Yeah, but the, uh,
case was dismissed.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.019
Well, it looks like
she stayed clean after that.

06:08.063 --> 06:11.980
Started a new life
as Mrs. Ashley Curtis.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.808
Wife of Navy Lieutenant
Preston Curtis.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.115
It doesn't mean she wasn't
involved in the heist.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.726
Old habits die hard,

06:18.769 --> 06:20.945
especially when bad influences
come knocking.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.513
All right, so Manning
escapes prison,

06:23.557 --> 06:25.689
robs a Navy bank
in the same city

06:25.733 --> 06:27.952
where his ex-fiancée,
now a Navy wife,

06:27.996 --> 06:29.258
just happens to live?

06:29.301 --> 06:31.391
Way too many coincidences,
if you ask me.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.655
Well, we need to go see
Ashley Curtis and ask her.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.396
I'll call Pride.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.885
I'm sorry,
just give me a second.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.321
It's the witching hour.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.019
Completely understandable,
Mrs. Curtis.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.805
Uh, kids, backyard, now.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.462
KATIE:
All right, let's go.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.463
ASHLEY:
Hey, it's okay.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.291
Go with Katie, all right?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.467
Oh, my big girl.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
Hey, if you need backup,
I'm right outside.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.949
ASHLEY: Thanks.KATIE: Okay?

07:11.605 --> 07:15.391
Uh... you said this isn't
about my husband?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.479
He's all right?

07:16.523 --> 07:17.785
Yes, ma'am, he's fine.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.353
We're here about John Manning.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.966
John's... in prison.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.315
Actually, he's not.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.535
He escaped a few days ago,

07:28.578 --> 07:32.321
killed a C.O., and headed
down to New Orleans,

07:32.364 --> 07:35.150
where he robbed a Navy
credit union this morning.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.108
Murdered a bank manager, too.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.154
My God.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.678
PRIDE:
Mrs. Curtis?

07:41.722 --> 07:44.159
Has John made any attempt
to contact you?

07:44.202 --> 07:46.117
No, I haven't heard
from that man in five years.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.423
Are you sure?Yeah, I think I'd remember

07:47.467 --> 07:50.513
if my convicted felon ex
came knocking.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.734
LASALLE: Okay,
but it's a real coincidence

07:53.777 --> 07:56.388
that he came all the way
from Nashville

07:56.432 --> 07:57.477
to New Orleans.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.349
John was nothing
but bad news for me.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.483
I walked away clean,
started over.

08:03.526 --> 08:07.095
Preston, my daughter, the Navy.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.879
You made a good life
for yourself.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.228
And I need to keep it good.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.580
No one here knows
about my past.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.670
None of the other wives.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.236
Not even Preston.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.890
LASALLE:
We'll keep it discreet.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.936
Still, we need to ask you

08:21.979 --> 08:24.025
where you were at 8:00
this morning.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.940
At the VFW, setting up
a pancake breakfast

08:25.983 --> 08:27.376
for the Family Readiness Group.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.551
PRIDE: Hosting the
new Navy families

08:28.595 --> 08:30.335
in town?It was our
welcome breakfast.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.034
Got there at 5:00 a.m.,
stayed through two seatings.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.339
Cleanup till 10:00 a.m.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.471
Lots of people saw me there.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.864
I'm sure they did.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.300
Well, I've got to
go back there tonight

08:38.343 --> 08:40.824
for orientation, in case
you want to put a tail on me.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.174
PRIDE:
Mrs. Curtis...

08:43.218 --> 08:45.133
we're not the enemy.

08:47.744 --> 08:52.967
Look, John was the biggest
mistake of my life.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.361
And I've been making up
for it every day since.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.320
If I do happen to
hear from him,

08:58.363 --> 09:01.932
I promise you two will be
the first to know.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
KATIE:
Cammie, get back here.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.241
Oh, and, um,
if you will excuse me,

09:06.284 --> 09:08.548
I think my four-year-old
just got loose.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.945
Cammie, come here.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.599
Think she's telling the truth?

09:16.643 --> 09:20.472
Honestly...
I'm just not sure.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.608
Hey, I interviewed
the entire neighborhood

09:25.652 --> 09:27.392
around the credit union.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.047
No one noticed a car full of
clowns leave the scene.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.440
Still no sign of Manning?

09:31.483 --> 09:32.615
He's disappeared.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.399
Doesn't leave us much to go on.

09:34.443 --> 09:37.402
Well, other than
Ashley Curtis lied to you.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.535
Check out her phone records
for the last 24 hours.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.800
She made at least ten calls
to the same number.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.106
Burner phone?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.412
Stolen phone, taken off
a retiree in City Park.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.415
Manning?Yeah. And the phone
stopped pinging

09:50.459 --> 09:52.287
early this morning,
so he probably trashed it.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.897
But he wasn't able to delete

09:53.941 --> 09:55.333
the cloud-based voice mail.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.858
ASHLEY :
John, don't do this. Please.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.425
There's got to be another way.That's from last night.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.297
GREGORIO: Sounds like Ashley
knew about the robbery.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.125
Why was she covering for him?

10:04.168 --> 10:06.431
Well, we got the voice mail,
let's bring her in and find out.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.564
Circumstantial at best.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.436
She's either scared,
or she's working with him.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.918
Regardless, we don't have
enough to...

10:16.267 --> 10:19.096
...to get her to talk.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.317
You got something else in mind?

10:22.360 --> 10:25.842
We need someone who can
earn her confidence.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.584
What does that mean?

10:31.543 --> 10:34.285
What?

10:40.857 --> 10:43.643
What the hell is Pride thinking?

10:43.686 --> 10:45.557
I don't fit in with these women.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.950
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.822
I think you're really killing
that sweater set.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.433
Thank you.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.700
Got our target. Heading over
to engage right now.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.702
New girl! I need your help.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.662
We've got 15 minutes to turn a
hundred napkins into sailboats.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.664
Oh...

11:07.014 --> 11:09.364
Fold twice.
Triangles, okay?

11:09.407 --> 11:10.626
SEBASTIAN:
This...

11:10.670 --> 11:13.194
is the greatest day of my life.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.337
So after two tours in Okinawa,
I'd had my fill of sushi

11:26.381 --> 11:28.122
and I said to Ted,
"Ted, if you love me,

11:28.165 --> 11:29.297
"you will take me
back stateside,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.907
because I've got a career, too."

11:30.951 --> 11:32.300
Turns out, he loves me,
though I was

11:32.343 --> 11:34.432
really hoping
for a post in Hawaii.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.956
Tell me about your family.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.740
What's that?

11:37.784 --> 11:39.002
Your family.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.569
Oh, yeah.

11:40.612 --> 11:44.007
Um, Randy's
with Sealift Logistics Command.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.227
We were in Naples
for the past six months.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.533
You know, when the Navy
says jump... Right?Mm.

11:48.577 --> 11:51.449
Yeah. Six tours, five cities,
three countries.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.494
Wow.
Kids?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.844
Yeah, one. His name's Sebastian.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.629
He's beyond annoying...I can hear you.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.457
...but we love him.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.329
WOMAN:
Mm. I've got three boys myself.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.028
Always a mess-- and the stains?
Food, dirt, ground-in grass?

12:05.072 --> 12:07.074
Yeah, those grass
stains are...

12:07.117 --> 12:08.684
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, those are easy.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.425
You just pretreat them
with a powder detergent,

12:10.468 --> 12:11.556
and then you switch to liquid.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.690
You know,
I find that pretreating

12:14.734 --> 12:16.039
with powder detergent
before switching

12:16.083 --> 12:18.259
to liquid does the trick.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Do you know those women?

12:22.785 --> 12:23.830
Ashley and...

12:23.873 --> 12:25.309
Katie? Yeah,
I know them.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.747
But I don't know themknow them,
you know?

12:27.790 --> 12:30.358
Not really.They're top kicks
around here.

12:30.401 --> 12:34.536
Kind of a close-knit circle,
but they're nice, for sure.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.320
Cool.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.804
Oh, look, we're done.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.893
Done? I've got a whole 'nother
crate in the other room.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.721
But you sit tight,
'cause I'm gonna go get them.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.941
Okay.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.421
You're doing great, Mama.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.772
I got eyes on Ashley.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.600
I'm moving in.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.385
I am just terrified
of a school search.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.821
Everybody says to find
a good elementary, right?

12:58.865 --> 13:01.345
But they totally leave out
the preschool shuffle.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.782
They won't even consider you
unless you apply

13:02.825 --> 13:04.392
while your child's in utero.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.654
When you finally get in,

13:05.697 --> 13:07.090
they transfer your family
across the country.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.700
Exactly.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.007
We have two strikes against us
because our husbands serve.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.226
I know, I know.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.663
You make it sound so daunting.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.578
Oh, no, sweetie, you just hunker
down and compel the school

13:16.621 --> 13:17.927
you want to accept your kid.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.799
Really?I mean, that's what

13:19.842 --> 13:22.453
my mother-in-law says, but my
son Sebastian's only four, so...

13:22.497 --> 13:23.628
Oh, Ashley has
a four-year-old, too.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.979
Oh.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.719
We should compare notes.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.809
Yeah, maybe we should.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.635
I'm Tammy.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.811
Katie.Hi, Katie.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.116
Ashley.Hi.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.990
Manning's BOLO
was extended statewide.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.600
Still no sign of him.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.210
Could have skipped town already.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.864
I'm not so sure.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.648
Dye packs that banks
use are designed

13:43.692 --> 13:47.174
to stain money and
skin bright red.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.653
Manning got a face
full of the stuff.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.220
He can't just slip away.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.657
Yeah, the minute he stepped out
in public, he'd be noticed.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.616
Yeah, it takes a specific
combination of chemicals

13:54.659 --> 13:56.705
to remove the dye.We track down

13:56.748 --> 13:58.489
where the chemicals
are sold locally,

13:58.533 --> 13:59.926
could put us right on his trail.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.363
It's worth a shot, Christopher.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.323
No, guys, Randy's great,
really, when he's around.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.108
Which is hardly ever.Ever.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.805
Oh, God, it's hard
doing this all on our own.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.980
But we are serving

14:11.024 --> 14:13.765
a higher purpose, ladies.
To the Navy.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.203
To the Navy.Okay, you guys
are joking,

14:16.246 --> 14:18.727
but I'm grateful.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.120
Look,

14:20.163 --> 14:22.600
without Preston, and without

14:22.644 --> 14:26.169
women like you who support me,
I'd be lost.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.345
That is all
thanks to the Navy.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.564
MICHELLE:
Damn straight, Ash.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.087
To the Navy.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.915
To the Navy.To the Navy.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.395
MICHELLE:
And to you ladies.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.571
You pulled off another
incredible event.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.747
Bravo-- hey, I just folded
some napkins.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.314
Uh, Michelle Gardner.Hi.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.837
Chairwoman
of Family Readiness Group.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.535
This is Tammy. She's awesome.

14:44.579 --> 14:48.409
I was assuming awesome Tammy
could speak for herself, Ash.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.627
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, damn.

14:49.671 --> 14:50.846
I think you just met
the queen bee.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.935
Eh, sometimes.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
I'm a little overwhelmed
right now,

14:54.502 --> 14:56.547
I get a little tongue-tied.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.724
Something tells me
you're never tongue-tied.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.857
Right, I guess not.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.772
But I do understand overwhelmed.Yes.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.817
I mean, that is what
we're here for, right, ladies?

15:05.861 --> 15:06.949
Absolutely.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.125
All for one, one for all.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.692
MICHELLE:
We've got options.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.433
Babysitters booked,
cleanup handled.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.087
We can go over
next week's schedule.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.784
Carpool, soccer, potluck...

15:15.827 --> 15:18.830
Or we can say screw it
and get our drink on.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.876
Yeah, I say screw it.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.660
I second that motion.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.314
Hey, I'm happy
to buy another round.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.926
Oh, thanks for that,
but this is where we work.
We're heading out.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.840
Oh, okay.KATIE: All right,
let's do it.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.712
Nice to meet you, Tammy.Yeah, you, too.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.322
Bye, Tammy.Bye.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.456
Hey, um,

15:35.499 --> 15:37.545
thanks for the drink.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.850
Oh, of course.I had a great time.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.461
I hope to see you again.Yeah, thanks for coming.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.810
Oh, God!

15:41.853 --> 15:44.552
: Oh! Oh, Tammy.I'm so sorry.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.728
GREGORIO: I am such a klutz.ASHLEY: No, it's fine.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.383
Hey, uh,

15:49.426 --> 15:50.775
wait here for a sec, okay?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.821
Yeah, sure.Okay.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.955
Hey, would you guys...

15:57.826 --> 16:00.655
Sebastian, Ashley's got
a Comfort Court key card

16:00.698 --> 16:03.223
in her bag.You thinking it's where
John Manning's hiding out?

16:03.266 --> 16:05.355
I'm thinking we need
to find out ASAP.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.878
Yeah, all right,
I'll call Pride and Lasalle.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
All right, meet me
out back in five.MICHELLE: Tammy.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.056
Yeah?

16:10.099 --> 16:12.449
Seems Ashley's kind of
fond of you.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.625
You want to,
you want to come tonight?

16:15.626 --> 16:16.932
Sure.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.021
Yeah, let me text my babysitter.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.936
Ah, first rule of
ladies' night...

16:20.980 --> 16:22.503
Never talk about ladies' night.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.592
Sounds kind of ominous.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.202
You have no idea.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.377
ASHLEY:
Come on.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.162
It'll be really fun.Thanks.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.686
I'm sorry about the
bag. I'm such a...Oh, it's fine.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.863
PRIDE:
Yeah, I'll review

16:34.906 --> 16:36.256
the Q4 budget tonight

16:36.299 --> 16:38.998
and get you some feedback
in the a.m., Steven.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.262
Y-Yes, yeah.
Yeah, just hang tight.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.878
Seem like you got something
on your mind.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.880
I'm trying to figure out

16:51.923 --> 16:56.189
why you're suddenly juggling
two jobs.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.714
Three, if you
count the bar.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.716
Well,

17:01.759 --> 17:05.024
a little multitasking
never hurt anyone.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.203
Work is one thing.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.596
Distraction is another.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.339
What would I be
distracting myself from?

17:18.080 --> 17:20.039
Your father.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.868
No matter

17:23.912 --> 17:25.914
what bad blood existed
between you...

17:25.957 --> 17:27.394
I'm okay.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.183
That's what I said, too.

17:34.227 --> 17:37.056
Then it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

17:38.361 --> 17:41.060
I appreciate you, Christopher.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.195
I appreciate you
looking out for me.

17:49.981 --> 17:54.508
Now, where are we
on finding Manning?

17:56.379 --> 17:58.642
Well, these are
the local vendors

17:58.686 --> 18:01.123
who sell the chemicals
that he needs

18:01.167 --> 18:03.778
to scrub the dye
off his skin.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.781
He'll be long gone by the time
we clear these locations.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.044
Thanks to Gregorio, we
don't have to clear any.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
The motel key card she found?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.135
Comfort Court

18:13.179 --> 18:14.876
has six locations

18:14.919 --> 18:16.486
in greater New Orleans.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.576
But only one of them

18:19.620 --> 18:21.665
is a block away
from everything Manning needs.

18:21.709 --> 18:25.800
Perfect place for him to lay
low until the heat dies down.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.629
Let's go find out.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.940
All right.You got it.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.551
SEBASTIAN: I mean,
I'm not trying to be sexist,

18:37.594 --> 18:40.119
but this is not what I thought
ladies' night was gonna be.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.381
MICHELLE:
All right.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.167
You're up next, Tammy.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.039
ASHLEY: Tammy.KATIE: Tammy.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.482
Oh...

18:57.136 --> 18:59.225
Whoa.Oh, God...

18:59.268 --> 19:00.791
SEBASTIAN:
That was convincingly awful.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.489
Nice work.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.968
I can't do...Relax there, okay?

19:04.012 --> 19:05.796
I can't do it.You're trying too hard.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.233
MICHELLE:
Ease your stance...

19:07.276 --> 19:09.670
Firm grip, two hands.

19:09.713 --> 19:10.975
Okay.
Both eyes open...

19:11.019 --> 19:12.194
KATIE:
Yes, please.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.195
Eyes open, yeah.Eyes open.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.110
MICHELLE:
And then,

19:15.154 --> 19:17.547
simply squeeze the trigger.Okay.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.119
Yeah!

19:24.163 --> 19:26.034
That's great!

19:26.077 --> 19:28.167
See? Just need a
little patience.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.212
Beginner's luck.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.693
Let's see what you got, Ashley.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.042
All right, all right.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.054
MICHELLE:
All right!

19:46.097 --> 19:47.229
SEBASTIAN:
Um...

19:47.273 --> 19:50.189
I think we found
our sharpshooting clown.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.888
Wow.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.760
You're always showing off, Ash.
You used up all our targets.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.719
Oh, I got some extras in my car.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.155
Oh, I'll go get them.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.244
KATIE:
Every time. Every time.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
MICHELLE:
Knock yourself out.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.727
ASHLEY:
Thanks, Tammy.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.946
SEBASTIAN: So, uh,
we got to assume Ashley's

20:08.990 --> 20:10.209
in on the robbery, right?

20:10.252 --> 20:11.949
Why, because she's got good aim?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.473
'Cause she's got good aim
and she was also dating

20:13.516 --> 20:15.170
that sociopath Manning.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.737
Yeah, I'm still not convinced.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.000
She's a dedicated mother,
not a bank robber.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.480
Yeah, well, maybe she's both.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.093
Maybe, Sebastian.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.274
I don't think she's alone.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.233
W-What do you mean?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.017
Found packaging for a clown mask

20:36.060 --> 20:38.367
in Michelle's car.Wait, really?

20:38.411 --> 20:41.152
Yes, really.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.328
Oh, wait-- shh.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.070
Hey.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.116
Got them.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.254
Should we, uh, go back?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.038
These women,

20:57.081 --> 20:59.170
they're not just friends.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.998
Yeah, I can tell you guys
are really tight.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.652
We're not just tight,
we're sisters.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.265
I'd do anything to protect them.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.833
Is this your way of saying
four is a crowd?

21:09.877 --> 21:12.880
I'm just... wondering
what it is you're looking for.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.361
A place to fit in.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.754
Maybe sisters of my own.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.328
Come on.

21:26.372 --> 21:30.158
Targets aren't gonna
set themselves up.

21:37.774 --> 21:41.082
Manager said Manning
was holing up in 219.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.795
Clear.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.841
Manning got the dye
off his face.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.625
That means he could be
100 miles from here now.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.238
Yeah, well...

22:08.675 --> 22:11.721
I don't think he's going
anywhere without this.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.901
Pride, someone's coming.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.824
NCIS, don't move!

23:09.779 --> 23:12.391
PRIDE: Chris, where are you? Over here.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.784
You all right?Yeah.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.917
That way. Went that way.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.681
So Manning is still in the wind,
no sign of him anywhere.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.857
I'm hoping you can tell me
more about our Navy wives.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.685
Well, we know where
they are, at least.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.730
Yeah, school drop-off
at the moment.

23:47.774 --> 23:48.905
Thank you.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.472
But Gregorio's gonna
run into Ashley

23:50.516 --> 23:51.995
at her local
coffee shop after.

23:52.039 --> 23:56.826
So, Katie Fisher, Ashley Curtis
and Michelle Gardner.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.654
All three women were
at the pancake breakfast

23:58.698 --> 24:00.395
at the time
of the credit union robbery.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.831
That doesn't mean
they couldn't

24:01.875 --> 24:04.486
have slipped out; credit union's
only ten minutes away.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.619
Not the smoking gun we need
to build a case.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.272
What do we know
about their backgrounds?

24:08.316 --> 24:10.449
Katie Fisher,
about a dozen parking tickets

24:10.492 --> 24:12.581
in the last three months.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.975
Other than that
and a fairly sick lotto habit,

24:15.018 --> 24:16.411
she's squeaky clean.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.457
That leaves us Ashley Curtis
and Michelle Gardner.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.676
Well, Ashley was engaged
to Manning.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.765
Right. But, turns out,

24:22.809 --> 24:24.985
she wasn't just his fiancée,
she was Bonnie to his Clyde.

24:25.028 --> 24:28.641
According to Nashville PD,
Ashley helped him run drugs.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.513
He refused to testify against
her when she was arrested.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.906
Yeah, he took the fall
for them both.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.864
So Ashley
is indebted to him

24:34.908 --> 24:36.431
for keeping her
out of prison.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.954
What about Michelle?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.303
Michelle was a teller

24:39.347 --> 24:41.784
at the credit union
for the last five years.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.091
Then last year she quit
after her husband was KIA.

24:44.134 --> 24:47.529
So she could be
our inside woman.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.053
She knew how and when
to best hit the bank.SEBASTIAN: Yeah.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.751
I mean, I've seen how close
these women are.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.883
It's not crazy to think
that Ashley recruited Michelle.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.494
Yeah, but why
would Michelle help?

24:55.537 --> 24:57.583
I mean, it's one thing
to do carpool together,

24:57.626 --> 25:00.020
it's another to commit
a felony and murder.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.717
Maybe we can leverage one
of them in interrogation.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.284
Turn on the other.

25:03.327 --> 25:07.418
Unless they're more scared of
Manning than they are us.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.117
So what's our next move?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.163
We still got
our own inside woman.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.948
We turn up
the pressure.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.124
Force Ashley's hand.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.218
Can you pass the
half-and-half?

25:24.261 --> 25:26.568
Hey.
Hey.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.135
How you feeling
this morning?

25:28.178 --> 25:31.442
Other than needing an
IV of coffee, peachy.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.793
It was fun
though, right?
Yeah.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.578
Yeah.
Thanks for
inviting me.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
Of course.

25:38.624 --> 25:42.323
Can I ask you something?Sure.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.543
You don't...

25:44.586 --> 25:46.849
You don't have
a lot of close friends.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.024
Do you?

25:48.068 --> 25:49.809
Um...
Uh,

25:49.852 --> 25:51.680
I'm sorry,
too personal.

25:51.724 --> 25:52.899
No, it's just...

25:52.942 --> 25:54.988
why do you think that?

25:56.076 --> 25:57.512
You seem lonely.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.645
Kind of closed off.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.734
Reminds me of me
a little while ago.

26:01.777 --> 26:05.476
Yeah, well, I've been burned
too many times.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.609
Made me cautious.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.744
Can really only
count on yourself.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.572
Sounds like a bad breakup.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.139
I've been there.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.533
I was with this one guy.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.970
Really bad.
Got in my head.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.232
Almost ruined me.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.756
Almost?

26:23.799 --> 26:26.585
Found the courage to quit him.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.630
Found my strength.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.241
Decided to become
the person I wanted to be.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.156
The person
you are now.
Yeah.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.900
You know, that person was open
to taking chances again.

26:37.944 --> 26:41.077
I met my husband,
found Michelle and Katie.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.905
Everything changed for me.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.820
Good for you.PRIDE: Mrs. Curtis?

26:46.213 --> 26:48.650
Sorry to interrupt.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.957
I need you to come with me.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.828
You have got to be
kidding me with this.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.787
I told NCIS
everything I know.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.310
I don't think you did.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.878
You need to come with me now
and please don't make a scene.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.967
You're the only one
making a scene right now.Tammy, don't.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.229
No, wait a minute.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.057
You come in here
in the middle of a crowd,

27:04.100 --> 27:07.103
trying to embarrass you.It's all right,
I'll go with him.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.670
No, you don't have to
go anywhere, Ash,

27:08.714 --> 27:10.977
unless he has a warrant,
which he doesn't.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.979
Or else the cuffs
would be out.Ma'am.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.067
This does not concern you.

27:14.110 --> 27:17.070
Sir, this does concern me

27:17.113 --> 27:18.506
and every woman in here

27:18.549 --> 27:20.856
who's husband is serving
to make a difference.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.206
You harass one of us,
you harass all of us.

27:24.904 --> 27:28.472
Now put your fancy sunglasses on
and get the hell out of here.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.041
Guess I can't come
with you after all...

27:32.085 --> 27:33.652
Special Agent.

27:36.045 --> 27:39.745
We'll be in touch,
Mrs. Curtis.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.278
LASALLE: Sounds like
that went well.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.975
She was perfect.

27:56.152 --> 27:59.634
I am so humiliated.No, don't be.
He was a jerk.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.157
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.506
You know what?
Let's just--

28:02.550 --> 28:04.117
let's get out of here.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.640
Let's go.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.946
: Okay.Come on.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.124
SEBASTIAN:
You think it worked?

28:11.167 --> 28:12.647
Yeah.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.780
Christopher and I are gonna
keep looking for Manning.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.217
Sebastian, stick close
to Gregorio.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.349
Let's see how this plays out.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.356
Here, sweetie.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.271
Thanks.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.754
We're officially in
"none of my business" territory,

28:32.798 --> 28:35.757
but if you want
to tell me why NCIS

28:35.801 --> 28:37.280
came to see you...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.983
Remember that ex
I was telling you about?

28:44.026 --> 28:45.245
Yeah.

28:45.288 --> 28:48.248
He's also a convicted felon.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.688
Really bad guy;
he escaped prison

28:53.732 --> 28:54.907
and came to see me.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.083
No way.Yeah, he...

28:57.126 --> 28:59.346
he asked me
for my help

28:59.389 --> 29:01.914
and when I said no,
he threatened to hurt me.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.265
Hurt Cammie.
Oh...

29:05.308 --> 29:08.050
What did he ask you to do?

29:09.312 --> 29:10.313
MICHELLE:
Ashley?

29:12.402 --> 29:15.928
I heard about the coffee shop.
Why didn't you call me?Tammy was there.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.802
She had my back.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.631
Well, thank goodness
for Tammy.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.072
LASALLE: Hey, King,
we got a hit on Manning.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.074
Where?

29:32.118 --> 29:34.337
Parking garage security camera
a few miles from the motel.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.124
Stole a car.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.300
Footage is less
than an hour ago.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.130
That's a late-model sedan.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.566
Should have a trackable GPS.

29:45.609 --> 29:49.396
FBI isolated the tags,
I'm working the GPS now.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.268
Car's headed west.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.531
I'll coordinate
with JPSO and NOPD.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.881
We got this guy.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.230
Soon as he's in custody,

29:57.273 --> 30:00.233
have Sebastian scoop up
Ashley and Michelle.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.932
I was so close, Sebastian.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.586
She was about to spill.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.153
You think you can get
Ashley away from Michelle,

30:07.196 --> 30:09.329
get her to keep talking?I don't know.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.417
Come on, T, you got this.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.114
Okay. You're right.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.161
Ashley's starting a load of
laundry, which gives us a moment

30:15.204 --> 30:17.119
for you to tell me
who the hell you are.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.165
You know who I am.

30:19.208 --> 30:22.168
I checked. Tammy Howard
whose husband served

30:22.211 --> 30:24.300
at NSA Naples
doesn't exist.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.346
I want the truth.

30:27.477 --> 30:30.176
You're a cop, right?

30:31.220 --> 30:33.396
I'm NCIS, Michelle.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.181
I know that you
and Ashley

30:35.224 --> 30:36.878
helped John Manning
rob the credit union.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.140
That's...
A fact.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.969
We're minutes away
from an arrest here.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.102
Your best play is being honest.

30:46.235 --> 30:48.237
Ashley's a good person.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.240
If she hadn't
cooperated,

30:51.284 --> 30:53.242
John would've killed her.And you went along with it?

30:53.286 --> 30:55.549
I was trying to help my friend.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.681
No one was supposed to get hurt.GREGORIO: Well, someone did,

30:57.725 --> 30:59.727
Michelle, and you two are in
a lot of trouble.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.207
Do you know where Manning is
right now?

31:01.250 --> 31:05.864
I would tell you if I did.

31:05.907 --> 31:09.258
There's a way out of this.

31:09.302 --> 31:13.262
NCIS can help you both,
but you have to trust me.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.268
JPSO just took down
the stolen car.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.358
Manning wasn't driving.Who was?

31:22.402 --> 31:24.883
Some kid he paid a hundred bucks
to take it out of town.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.972
Manning isn't running,

31:27.015 --> 31:29.931
he just wanted us
to think he was.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.193
Why?

31:31.237 --> 31:32.978
Let's go talk to Ashley.
We'll figure it out.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.327
Okay.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.243
Ashley?

31:37.286 --> 31:39.854
Let's all be really
calm right now.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.770
Have a little chat.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.179
What's your name?!

32:00.222 --> 32:02.833
Tammy Howard.
You must be the ex-boyfriend.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.792
You one of them Navy wives?

32:04.835 --> 32:06.533
Yeah, I'm just one of the girls.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.274
That's funny 'cause
these two swore

32:08.317 --> 32:09.884
they weren't gonna
talk to anyone else!

32:09.928 --> 32:11.625
I can be very persuasive.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.932
Too bad for you.
Let's go!

32:13.975 --> 32:15.498
SEBASTIAN:
Hold on, Gregorio.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.109
Cavalry's coming.No!

32:17.152 --> 32:18.806
Was that a no
to me or to him?

32:18.849 --> 32:20.851
What do you mean no?

32:20.895 --> 32:22.679
Why don't you just leave?
We won't say a word.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.814
PRIDE: Sebastian.Pride, we got a problem.

32:26.857 --> 32:29.860
Cops got my getaway money. Y'all
are gonna help me get more.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.166
Not anymore.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.994
That's funny, you thinking
you have a choice.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.214
You're gonna help me hit that
other bank you told me about.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.650
And then you'll
help me leave town.

32:36.693 --> 32:37.956
We're done helping you.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.480
She's right, John.
You're on your own. Just go!

32:44.919 --> 32:47.878
Pride, you got to get here now.
Shots fired.

32:55.364 --> 32:57.801
I'm not playing around here.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.327
Guess you just earned
a place on the team.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.937
I'm not robbing a bank with you.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.417
You don't have a choice!

33:06.288 --> 33:09.900
You try anything,
I'll kill you both.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.860
And then I'll
find your kid.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.908
Okay. All right.

33:19.867 --> 33:20.999
Let's go.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.176
Come on.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.272
: Help me.

33:40.279 --> 33:42.933
Here, put pressure on the
wound. Okay? Right here.

33:42.977 --> 33:46.285
This is NCIS Agent
Sebastian Lund

33:46.328 --> 33:48.287
requesting an ambulance
to 935 Wisteria.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.811
Victim has a single GSW
to the abdomen.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.073
It's gonna be
all right, okay?

33:52.117 --> 33:53.379
Where is Manning taking them?

33:56.121 --> 33:58.906
I tried to stop him.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.870
PRIDE:
Got it.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.569
Manning just kidnapped
Gregorio and Ashley.

34:09.612 --> 34:10.874
Any idea where he's taking them?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.180
Sebastian says they're
gonna rob another bank.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.486
He doesn't know which one.

34:13.529 --> 34:16.010
Michelle used to work
at another bank,

34:16.054 --> 34:18.404
Crescent City Savings Loan.Well, it's got to be it.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.014
She'd be familiar
with security protocol,

34:20.058 --> 34:21.407
just like at the credit union.

34:30.155 --> 34:33.593
You even think
about leaving,

34:33.636 --> 34:35.160
your friend here is dead.

34:36.465 --> 34:39.077
You're coming with me.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.951
This one's not loaded.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.738
But this one is.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.047
Get down!

34:55.093 --> 34:57.486
You put a dye pack in there,

34:57.530 --> 34:59.706
Christine, I will kill

34:59.749 --> 35:02.404
your entire family.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.624
Are we clear?!

35:04.667 --> 35:06.321
Are we clear?!

35:08.976 --> 35:10.543
Good girl.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.459
Hey!

35:13.502 --> 35:15.287
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

35:15.330 --> 35:16.940
I'm sorry.
Don't shoot me.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.117
You hit that silent alarm,
didn't you?

35:19.160 --> 35:20.944
Last mistake
you'll ever make.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.511
Don't!

35:23.686 --> 35:24.992
Let's go.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.952
Let's get the hell
out of here!

35:28.996 --> 35:30.867
Let's go!

35:30.911 --> 35:32.869
Come on! Let's go!

35:32.913 --> 35:35.089
Start the engine!

35:36.221 --> 35:38.266
Let's go, let's go!

35:38.310 --> 35:40.050
Drive! Drive!

35:40.094 --> 35:43.010
I told you what would happen
if you messed with me!

35:43.053 --> 35:45.055
Relax. No one needs
to get hurt now!

35:59.940 --> 36:01.898
Drive! Drive!

36:01.942 --> 36:04.640
OFFICER:
Out of the car! Hands up!

36:12.953 --> 36:14.389
You're coming with me.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.136
OFFICER:
Get SWAT up here!

36:22.180 --> 36:23.746
NCIS! Don't shoot!

36:23.790 --> 36:25.444
Hands up! On the ground!Don't shoot!

36:25.487 --> 36:27.663
Stand down, Officers,
stand down. She's with us.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.056
Manning has Ashley.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.275
Come on!

36:31.885 --> 36:34.627
Secure the bank.
Make sure everybody's safe.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.586
We've got multiple exits.All right, split up. Go.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.255
Get out of the way!

36:54.299 --> 36:56.866
Manning, let her go!
I'm a federal agent!

36:56.910 --> 36:58.868
Stay back!

36:58.912 --> 37:00.653
Ashley's got nothing
to do with this.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.829
She owes me!
I saved her life!

37:02.872 --> 37:04.787
Doesn't mean it belongs to you.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.835
I'm getting the hell
out of here!No, wait, whoa.

37:08.878 --> 37:13.927
You want to make a deal?
Take me instead.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.276
Okay?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.279
Cop's worth more than she is.
You know I'm right.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.934
I'm the only way
you get what you want.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.504
Drop it, Manning!

37:39.648 --> 37:42.912
It's over, Ashley.
He can't hurt you anymore.

37:50.746 --> 37:54.054
Hey. Good news.

37:54.097 --> 37:57.013
Michelle got out of surgery.
She's gonna pull through.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.277
Where's Cammie?She's with Katie.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.800
She's okay.

38:00.843 --> 38:05.021
Your husband boarded a C130.
He's headed back from Dubai.

38:05.065 --> 38:09.417
How am I gonna
explain this to him?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.898
You were protecting your family.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.943
I was a coward.

38:13.987 --> 38:17.643
I should've
stood up to John.

38:17.686 --> 38:22.212
Yeah, well, you made some
bad choices, Ashley, it's true,

38:22.256 --> 38:24.867
but you made them
for all the right reasons,

38:24.911 --> 38:26.869
and there's nothing
cowardly about that.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.787
But I'm still going to prison.

38:31.831 --> 38:36.966
NCIS is recommending leniency
for extenuating circumstances.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.194
Uh...

38:47.237 --> 38:50.371
I...

38:50.415 --> 38:54.375
I know we were never
really friends...

38:56.029 --> 38:59.815
...but I think in another life
we could be.

39:01.904 --> 39:05.343
Yeah, I think so, too.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.911
Take care, Ash.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.838
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, you made it.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.884
Let's eat.
I'm starving.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.276
Come on now. Hang on.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.061
Gregorio, you know jambalaya
takes time and patience.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.063
Yeah, well,
I've got none of that.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.635
You did good today.

39:36.678 --> 39:37.897
Thanks. For a minute there,

39:37.940 --> 39:39.377
I didn't think
I was gonna survive.

39:39.420 --> 39:40.813
The bank robber
or the housewives?

39:40.856 --> 39:42.292
Both.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.990
I never once doubted you.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.079
LASALLE:
Hey, me neither.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.081
Does that mean someone's
gonna feed me?

39:48.124 --> 39:49.778
All right, Gregorio.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.432
Let's make some plates.
Yes.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.694
Hey.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.392
Yeah?Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:54.435 --> 39:55.480
Yeah, sure.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.092
Um... so I was,

39:59.135 --> 40:00.441
I was kind of thinking,
you know...

40:00.485 --> 40:02.225
Okay.
Um...

40:02.269 --> 40:04.097
If you're cool with it--
obviously, I don't want to...

40:04.140 --> 40:05.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Um...

40:05.664 --> 40:07.405
You know, sometimes...

40:07.448 --> 40:08.928
Sometimes when
two people, uh,

40:08.971 --> 40:11.887
feel certain ways
about where they...

40:11.931 --> 40:14.020
Sebastian.

40:14.063 --> 40:17.110
I would love to move
in your house with you.

40:17.153 --> 40:18.720
How'd you know
I was gonna ask that?

40:18.764 --> 40:20.026
I didn't. I was just hoping.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.288
Yeah?
Yeah.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.333
This is great. Yeah.It's great. Yeah!

40:23.377 --> 40:25.423
I finally got someone I can
binge-watch Doctor Whowith.

40:25.466 --> 40:28.034
And you know what?
Give me a good deal on the rent,

40:28.077 --> 40:29.252
I'll watch
whatever you want.Done.
