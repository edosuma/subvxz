What's your emergency?

00:23.648 --> 00:25.150
- [Man] I, I, I, I
don't, I don't know.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.278
I, I'm, I just got home and
my front door is wide open

00:28.278 --> 00:31.239
and there's, there's,
there's blood everywhere.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.408
Billy, you stay there.
Do not come in here!

00:33.408 --> 00:34.951
- [Operator] Sir, can you
see anyone injured inside?

00:34.951 --> 00:36.786
- [Man] I don't, I don't
know! I don't know!

00:36.786 --> 00:38.997
My, my wife, she's
here, I know she's here,

00:38.997 --> 00:40.290

00:40.290 --> 00:41.499
- [Operator] Sir,
listen carefully.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.834
I need you to leave
the house now.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.003
Do you understand?
Step out of the house.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.465
- [Man] Oh my God. Oh my God.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.259
No, no, no!

00:51.259 --> 00:53.178
- Sir. Sir.
- No!

00:53.178 --> 00:54.554
- [Operator] Emergency
vehicles are on their way.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.139

01:21.748 --> 01:22.582
- No.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.876
No, I didn't talk to him.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.337
Because he was on call today.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.674
No, I don't know his
schedule, you psycho.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.512
(scoffs) Yes, I
know. He's very cute.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.600
Hmm? Mm, not really.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.565
Uh, no. I'm good, actually.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.359
I also have that
pizza in the freezer,

01:49.359 --> 01:50.985
so I can just make that.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.782
Are you serious? I was gonna...

01:55.782 --> 01:57.534
Fine. Fine, I'll
go to the store.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.993
Do you want anything?

01:58.993 --> 02:01.371
(scoffs) Oh, you're not hungry?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.497
Yeah, I wonder why.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.040
Maybe because you ate my pizza.

- Hey.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.636
- How's it going?

05:03.636 --> 05:06.014
- (sighs) Well, I haven't
smashed my laptop yet,

05:06.014 --> 05:07.682
so I feel like it's
a moral victory.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.767
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.477
- (groans) I don't
know, I think maybe

05:11.477 --> 05:13.938
I should stay here this
weekend and work on it.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.189
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.234
- Wait, what? No.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.360
- The deadline is Monday.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.528
- No, forget that.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.697
- I have-
- No, there's no way.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.365
We're going. We're going.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.659

- Uh-huh. (laughs)

05:30.621 --> 05:32.373
How can you tell?

05:32.373 --> 05:33.583
- Well, you know, I'm a doctor.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.625
I'm trained in these matters.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.585
(woman laughs)
I know where

05:35.585 --> 05:36.836
all the parts are.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.256
- (laughs) Do you have
a cure for me, Doctor?

05:40.256 --> 05:43.092
- (laughs) I do.
I do have a cure.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.887
Maybe I'll whip
up a cure for you.

05:45.887 --> 05:49.265
- Ah, okay.
- Let's put you like this.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.933
This is all very scientific

05:50.933 --> 05:54.270
with pressure
points and chakras-

05:54.270 --> 05:56.105
- I see.
- And things like that.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.148
- Uh-huh.
- Feel that?

05:57.148 --> 05:59.817
- Uh-huh.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.154
- Hey, I got you.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.948
- [Blake] Yes. Yes, you have.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.532
- Wasn't sure if I'd reached you

20:42.532 --> 20:44.701
with the shitty cell
service up there.

20:44.701 --> 20:49.164
- Well, lucky me. My
GPS says three miles.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.999
- Oh, wow. You're almost there.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.002
Welcome to Northdale. Really?

20:54.002 --> 20:57.297
Home of the, uh, I don't know
what they're the home of,

20:57.297 --> 20:59.383
but it's ours for the weekend.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.261
- Oh, I can't wait.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.680
I wish you were coming tonight.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.932
- Oh, me, too.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.476
After this fucking week. Brutal.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.063
- Come to me, babe.
I'll make it all better.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.107
- Yeah, I'm aware
of your skillset.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.900
It's what gets me
through the day.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.360
Hey, but look at it this way.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.779
You're gonna have a whole
day to work on the book. Yay!

21:20.779 --> 21:23.073
- Ugh, God, I have no
interest in writing

21:23.073 --> 21:24.741
for three-year-olds anymore.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.703
They're stupid. They lack
all thought and reason.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.914
- Aw, you're gonna make a
wonderful mother someday.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.500
(Blake laughs)

21:34.543 --> 21:37.212
(birds calling)

21:43.593 --> 21:46.305
(insect buzzing)

21:53.395 --> 21:56.023
(ominous music)

22:07.159 --> 22:08.577
You got my message, right?

22:08.577 --> 22:09.870
- Yes. Yes, thank you.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.122
I would've died without wine.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.751
- Wow.
- Stop. You know what I mean.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.836
- I do. You're a
snot-flying drunk.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.505
- Hey, I think I'm here.

22:28.930 --> 22:29.890
- It's nice, right?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.268
- What? The front door is open.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.980
(cell phone crackling)

22:36.980 --> 22:38.148
Jack?
- Hello?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.109
Blake!

22:42.652 --> 22:43.487
- Jack?

22:44.988 --> 22:46.615
Shit.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.284
(ominous music)

23:53.098 --> 23:53.932
Hello?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.063
Is there anybody here?

24:02.941 --> 24:03.775
Hello?

24:07.821 --> 24:10.824
(suspenseful music)

24:14.453 --> 24:15.412
Hello?

24:15.412 --> 24:18.415
(suspenseful music)

25:55.637 --> 25:59.975
Oh. (chuckles)

26:01.184 --> 26:03.186
(sighs)

26:10.318 --> 26:12.988
(ominous music)

26:45.437 --> 26:48.189
(birds chirping)

26:49.983 --> 26:52.652
(ominous music)

26:59.618 --> 27:02.329
(fire crackling)

27:12.255 --> 27:13.089
Mm.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.886
(clicking)

27:17.886 --> 27:20.555
(ominous music)

27:32.400 --> 27:34.694
(clicking)

27:53.296 --> 27:55.924
(clicking)

27:55.924 --> 27:58.927
(suspenseful music)

28:16.778 --> 28:18.988
(scraping)

28:21.282 --> 28:24.285
(suspenseful music)

28:27.580 --> 28:29.833
(scraping)

28:39.843 --> 28:44.556
(sighs) God, get a
grip, Sinclair! Oh.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.266
(glass shatters)
(Blake screams)

28:46.266 --> 28:50.311
(gasping) Who's out there?

28:50.311 --> 28:52.147
Is somebody out there?

28:54.482 --> 28:57.485
(suspenseful music)

30:03.718 --> 30:04.677
(papers slam)
(woman gasps)

30:04.677 --> 30:06.471
- Ah!
- For reals?

30:06.471 --> 30:07.806
- Payback's a bitch.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.642
- You look tired.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.519
- That's because I am.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.395
- ER 8 is open.
Take a quick nap.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.688
- Oh, that sounds so good.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.983
Thank you. Another whole pile.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.778
Um, yeah, that'd be good
because Blake would kill me

30:21.778 --> 30:23.112
if I slept all weekend.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.784
- Oh, that's right.
This is the big weekend.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.078
Nervous?
- No.

30:31.871 --> 30:33.665
Maybe a little.
- Don't be.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.750
You have nothing to worry about.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.043
You're two peas in a pod.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.754
- Oh, that's really corny.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.589
But thank you.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.968
Should probably hang
on to these, Heather.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.719
I have a nap to do.

30:46.719 --> 30:47.637
Wake me in an hour!

30:49.097 --> 30:50.932
- Sure thing.

30:50.932 --> 30:51.766
Why not?

30:53.309 --> 30:56.271
(crickets chirping)

31:12.662 --> 31:15.331
(ominous music)

31:29.637 --> 31:32.640
(suspenseful music)

31:50.909 --> 31:53.661
(tinkling music)

32:38.748 --> 32:41.751
(suspenseful music)

32:45.046 --> 32:47.840
(birds chirping)

33:00.478 --> 33:04.273
(faint background chattering)

33:08.903 --> 33:11.364
(knocking)
- Hmm?

33:11.364 --> 33:12.949
- Some, uh, interesting reading.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.996
- My wife gets 'em, and
then she quizzes me.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.747
- Your secret's
safe with me, sir.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.043
- Is there something
I can help you with?

33:24.043 --> 33:26.879
- It's talking about
this. Just came in.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.926
(ominous music)

33:33.511 --> 33:35.013
- Northdale.
- Yep.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.683
- Isn't that where-
- Uh-huh.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.436
(dramatic music)

33:53.906 --> 33:56.659
(birds chirping)

33:58.995 --> 34:01.456
(mellow music)

34:37.200 --> 34:39.952
(birds chirping)

35:18.616 --> 35:21.285
(ominous music)

35:56.904 --> 36:00.158
(telephone ringing)

36:00.158 --> 36:02.368
- [Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.703
(phone beeps)

36:03.703 --> 36:06.539
- Baby! Hey, I'm on my way.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.959
I gotta make a quick little
stop at the hospital.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.044
I promise I'm in
and out two minutes.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.463
And then I'm coming after you.

36:14.463 --> 36:17.425
Can't wait to see you.
You better not be smoking.

36:18.801 --> 36:21.637
(water trickling)

36:50.708 --> 36:53.377
(ominous music)

37:04.931 --> 37:06.641
(twig snaps)

37:06.641 --> 37:09.310
(ominous music)

37:15.316 --> 37:17.735
(twig snaps)

37:41.259 --> 37:43.928
(ominous music)

38:19.046 --> 38:21.549
(eerie music)

38:38.399 --> 38:43.404
(thudding)
(suspenseful music)

38:44.196 --> 38:46.449
(thudding)

38:49.327 --> 38:52.163
(thudding)
(suspenseful music)

38:52.163 --> 38:54.915
- Hey! Hey, I know that
you're out there, okay?

38:54.915 --> 38:55.916
This isn't funny.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.377
Just leave me alone!

39:01.213 --> 39:03.257
(rock thudding)

39:03.257 --> 39:05.968
(dramatic music)

39:15.436 --> 39:18.105
(Blake screams)

39:21.108 --> 39:22.818
Oh my God! Oh my God!

39:23.694 --> 39:26.447
(dramatic music)

40:12.410 --> 40:15.329
(Blake whimpering)

40:17.164 --> 40:18.499
Hello? Come out!

40:19.834 --> 40:21.585
Help! Is anybody home?

40:21.585 --> 40:23.337
Please? Hello, hello?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.341
Hello? Help, help!

40:29.135 --> 40:31.178
Hello? Anybody?

40:31.178 --> 40:33.097
Hello, is anybody home?

40:34.849 --> 40:37.518
(Blake panting)

40:39.270 --> 40:42.231
(suspenseful music)

40:50.990 --> 40:53.617
(ominous music)

41:13.637 --> 41:16.307
(woman panting)

41:26.901 --> 41:30.279
(Blake panting)

41:30.279 --> 41:33.282
(suspenseful music)

41:55.763 --> 41:56.931
Shit.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.600
(dramatic music)

42:11.278 --> 42:12.112
Okay.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.451
No, no, no! Shit, shit!

42:19.703 --> 42:21.121
Fucking kidding me!

42:21.121 --> 42:23.874
(dramatic music)

42:27.044 --> 42:28.629
Oh.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.130
Excuse me, sir!

42:30.130 --> 42:31.632
Sir, can you help-

42:34.635 --> 42:37.721
(cell phone chiming)

42:44.645 --> 42:47.523
(Blake whimpering)

42:51.277 --> 42:56.240
(ominous music)
(cell phone chiming continues)

43:02.913 --> 43:03.747
- Blake?

43:05.624 --> 43:08.002
Hello? Baby, can you hear me?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.045
Blake? Hello?

43:15.134 --> 43:17.928
(phone ringing)

43:17.928 --> 43:19.597
Hey, baby. I lost you for a-

43:21.807 --> 43:24.393
(man grunting)

43:28.689 --> 43:31.483
(phone ringing)

43:31.483 --> 43:33.861
- [Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.196
(phone beeps)

43:36.196 --> 43:38.866
(ominous music)

43:58.469 --> 43:59.261
- Fuck it.

44:01.221 --> 44:02.723
Call Anza Sheriff's Department.

44:03.724 --> 44:06.393
(phone ringing)

44:07.770 --> 44:08.896
- Oh, no, no.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.566
I'll get it.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.404
Sheriff Logan.

44:17.404 --> 44:20.074
- Hi, this is Dr. Jack Conrad.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.701
I'm calling because I'm
hoping I can get someone

44:22.701 --> 44:24.745
to do a wellness check for me.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.122
- Is this a medical emergency?

44:27.122 --> 44:28.957
- Uh, I don't, I don't know.

44:28.957 --> 44:32.169
Really it's more of a
gut feeling, I guess.

44:33.587 --> 44:35.673
It's, it's, it's my fiance,
well, my, my girlfriend.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.759
Her name's Blake Sinclair,
and she's up there alone,

44:38.759 --> 44:41.387
and I have not been able
to get in touch with her.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.264
- Cell phone service around
here is sketchy at best.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.766
Drives us nuts.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.017
- Oh, no, I know, I get it.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.436
But there's something,
something strange here

44:49.436 --> 44:52.272
because I, I've, I've
called several times

44:52.272 --> 44:54.566
and it's always gone
straight to voicemail.

44:54.566 --> 44:58.362
And the last time I called,
someone picked up the phone.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.072
I mean, I could,
I could hear them.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.408
It was like, someone was there,
I could hear 'em listening,

45:02.408 --> 45:05.661
but no one talked, and
then it disconnected.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.205
I called right back,
and then it sounded like

45:08.205 --> 45:10.833
someone was smashing
the phone or something.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.835
- Okay. What's her location?

45:14.169 --> 45:16.505
- Well, she's up in Northdale
at my family's cabin.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.466
- Northdale?
- Yeah. Yeah.

45:19.466 --> 45:21.844
It's about four
miles out of town

45:21.844 --> 45:24.596
off the Douglas Pine Highway.

45:24.596 --> 45:26.473
- Stand by Doctor.

45:26.473 --> 45:27.307
Talley!

45:28.267 --> 45:29.101
Get in here.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.153
Doctor, what's your address
up there in Northdale?

45:40.154 --> 45:41.947
- [Jack] 31 South Sycamore.

45:41.947 --> 45:43.741
- 31 South Sycamore.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.285
Is this the number
I can reach you on

45:46.285 --> 45:48.120
with the 479 area code?

45:48.120 --> 45:51.331
Yeah, yeah, that's my cell.
I'm on my way up there now.

45:51.331 --> 45:53.625
- We're about an
hour from there.

45:53.625 --> 45:55.961
I'll send a patrol car
up there to take a look.

45:57.087 --> 45:59.590
- (sighs) Thank you.
Appreciate that.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.341
Like I said, I don't know
why this is bugging me.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.136
It's more of a gut
feeling, I guess, but-

46:04.136 --> 46:05.929
- Sometimes those
are the best kind.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.682
Drive carefully.
- [Jack] Thanks.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.645
- Northdale?
- Yeah, Northdale.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.732
- It's a pretty popular
place as of late.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.443
- Yeah, I have to
agree with you on that.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.278
So many things going missing.

46:22.571 --> 46:24.281
Why don't you take a
little ride up there

46:24.281 --> 46:25.699
and poke around a bit?

46:26.784 --> 46:27.659
- Copy that.

46:35.709 --> 46:39.338
(crickets chirping)

46:39.338 --> 46:42.007
(ominous music)

46:49.848 --> 46:52.351
(Blake gasps)

46:53.811 --> 46:56.480
(ominous music)

48:31.450 --> 48:34.453
(suspenseful music)

48:45.130 --> 48:47.799
(ominous music)

49:06.485 --> 49:07.861
(Blake grunts)

49:07.861 --> 49:10.864
(suspenseful music)

49:24.628 --> 49:26.880
(thudding)

49:30.592 --> 49:32.844
(thudding)

49:36.056 --> 49:38.308
(thudding)

49:41.186 --> 49:43.397
(thudding)

49:46.817 --> 49:49.069
(thudding)

49:52.239 --> 49:54.491
(thudding)

49:59.079 --> 50:00.831
(thudding)

50:00.831 --> 50:03.500
(ominous music)

50:06.044 --> 50:07.254
(thudding)

50:07.254 --> 50:09.923
(ominous music)

50:11.341 --> 50:13.468
(thudding)

50:13.468 --> 50:15.429
(door squeaks)

50:15.429 --> 50:18.432
(crickets chirping)
