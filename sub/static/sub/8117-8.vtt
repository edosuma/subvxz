WEBVTT

00:57.858 --> 01:01.061
What have you got for me today?

01:11.805 --> 01:15.443
I'm going to
ask you one more time.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.945
What have you told the Sixers?

01:17.978 --> 01:22.015
We only ever did business
with Mira and her people.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.485
They "quid-ed,"
I "pro quo-ed."

01:24.518 --> 01:26.887
Medical supplies for money,
I never gave them

01:26.920 --> 01:30.158
any information about the inside
workings of the colony.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.125
Where's my son?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.594
I swear I have no idea.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.164
Is he the one helping Mira
communicate with 2149?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.232
I don't know
how she does it!

01:38.266 --> 01:43.204
I don't know anything.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.005
You know more than
you're telling me,

01:45.038 --> 01:46.307
and that's unacceptable,

01:46.340 --> 01:49.009
so you're gonna sit here
and you're gonna rot,

01:49.042 --> 01:51.412
until you're
ready to start

01:51.445 --> 01:54.047
answering questions
to my satisfaction.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.685
Now, what have you told
the Sixers?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.488
Have a seat, Taylor,

02:00.521 --> 02:03.056
because if I have to
tell you everything

02:03.090 --> 02:05.459
I don't know
all over again...

02:05.493 --> 02:08.395
we're gonna be here a while.

02:12.032 --> 02:15.403
You look tired, Tom.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.373
Get some rest.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.677
We'll talk later.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.383
Meantime... sleep tight.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.833
How many of these
do we have left?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.801
A few.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.037
Okay, eight.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.739
Ten.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.141
But it beats digging trenches,
doesn't it?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.452
Cleaning the hair catcher
in your shower

02:55.476 --> 02:56.844
beats digging trenches, Maddy.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.612
You're disgusting.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.348
Well, between trenches,
hair catchers

03:00.381 --> 03:01.682
and pretty lanterns,

03:01.715 --> 03:03.884
I say we celebrate
this Harvest Carnival, huh?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.118
Harvest Festival.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.687
When everybody celebrates
the day.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.956
Commander Taylor came
through the portal.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.292
That's good.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.026
Hey.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.463
Hi. What's all this?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.865
Guess who got the lead
in the Harvest play.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.333
Me!
No!

03:19.367 --> 03:23.203
Yeah! Our daughter's gonna
be playing none other

03:23.237 --> 03:24.805
than Commander Nathaniel Taylor
himself.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.006
How about that!

03:26.039 --> 03:27.140
This is very convincing.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.943
To paint it gray. Going.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.111
Dad, can I talk to you?

03:31.144 --> 03:34.081
Yeah. Uh, you're still grounded.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.283
Good talk, son.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.786
I know. Can I talk to
you in private, please?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.354
Okay.
Good.

03:40.388 --> 03:45.025
Yeah? Can you move?
Can you talk?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.060
It's about Boylan.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.161
Yeah?

03:48.195 --> 03:50.197
Uh, I know
you don't like him.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.599
But the since the bar closed,

03:51.632 --> 03:53.701
no one's heard
from him in a while,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.270
and I was just wondering
if you knew where he was.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.172
He's been detained.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.674
So Taylor's
interrogating him?

04:00.708 --> 04:04.278
Commander Taylor
is questioning him.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.847
You don't think
Boylan's a Sixer, do you?

04:06.880 --> 04:07.948
I don't know.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.118
He's got some pretty big
questions he needs to answer.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.353
I mean, just doing business

04:12.386 --> 04:14.121
with the Sixers
is a big deal.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.055
Yeah, I get that.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.925
But it was just business, Dad.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.293
He's not the first one
to go behind Taylor's...

04:20.327 --> 04:21.495
Commander Taylor's back.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.964
You've done it.
Do you belong in a jail cell?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.634
Josh, this isn't about me.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.737
I know this is all my fault.
None of this would be

04:29.770 --> 04:31.305
happening if I hadn't
stolen the meds.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.440
I'm just asking you

04:32.473 --> 04:35.809
to check on Boylan.
That's all. Please?

04:38.346 --> 04:40.481
I'll see what I can do.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.286
Reynolds, got a two-day drive
to Med outpost Nine.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.221
Mandatory check-in
every hundred klicks,

04:48.255 --> 04:50.090
full contingent report
on arrival.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.992
Yes, sir.

04:53.193 --> 04:56.163
Hey, stay sharp.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.934
Move out!

05:05.406 --> 05:07.875
You closed Boylan's bar.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.909
That I did.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.244
Word is, you've had him
locked up in your compound

05:11.278 --> 05:12.513
for the last two days
straight.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.215
That would be standard
interrogation procedure.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.785
Uh-huh. You making
any progress?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.856
Well, come have a
look for yourself.

05:25.325 --> 05:29.196
Mares eat oats, does eat oats,

05:29.229 --> 05:32.332
and little lambs
eat ivy...

05:32.366 --> 05:35.469
Is he okay?
Fine.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.571
I spiked his food with
something "special."

05:37.605 --> 05:40.508
Thought it might
loosen him up.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.242
Looks like you gave him
a little too much.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.445
Oh, it's not impossible. Mm.

05:44.478 --> 05:48.048
He still won't say how he's
communicating with Mira.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.483
Probably just using

05:49.517 --> 05:51.685
a secure band or network
you don't know about.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.787
I've been monitoring
every magnetic, radio

05:53.821 --> 05:56.356
and all electronic signal
in the sky for months now.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.859
Nah, they're using
something else.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.562
Well, I don't think
you're gonna

06:01.595 --> 06:03.431
get much out of him today.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.833
If not today, tomorrow.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.034
He'll break.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.270
You know, he did shoot a Sixer
and saved your life recently.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.839
You really think
he's working for them?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.774
Even if he's not,
just having him here

06:13.807 --> 06:15.342
might make the real spy
feel safer

06:15.375 --> 06:17.678
maybe even slip up.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.613
But that ain't exactly
grounds to hold him.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.881
Mm. He's got
information.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.651
"Grounds" or not,
he's gonna give it up.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.820
I want the truth, you
hear me?! The truth!

06:26.854 --> 06:30.190
Commander, we've got a situation
with the power grid

06:30.223 --> 06:31.267
at the new housing section.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.727
I'm on my way.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.335
You coming?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.271
I'm just gonna give him
some water.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.606
Flush his system a bit.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.979
Hey, Boylan...

06:52.012 --> 06:56.249
drink this.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.618
It's water.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.254
You all right?

07:01.288 --> 07:04.291
You want the truth, Taylor?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.360
'Cause I know the truth.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.329
Uh... I'm not...

07:09.362 --> 07:14.001
It's buried right where
you left it.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.235
What is?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.369
Right by Pilgrim's Tree.

07:16.403 --> 07:20.073
You-you want to push me?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.909
What's a Pilgrim's Tree?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.878
Then I'm gonna
tell the whole world...

07:24.912 --> 07:29.116
then it's all over for you,
Taylor.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.218
It's all over.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.200
Oh, my God, Jim, what's
that in your eye?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.969
What?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.940
It's a flicker of intelligence.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.107
Who knew?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.678
I'll be out of your three
remaining hairs in a minute.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.288
I'm just looking for something
called Pilgrim's Tree

07:59.312 --> 08:00.714
on the map
of the colony here.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.483
Why are you looking
for Pilgrim's Tree?

08:03.517 --> 08:04.985
Why don't you tell me
where it is,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.154
and we'll wrap
this conversation right up?

08:07.187 --> 08:10.958
Well, it's the large banyan
that Taylor lived in

08:10.991 --> 08:13.260
when he first came
through the portal.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.327
Taylor lived in a tree?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.730
It kept him safe.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.931
Of course, that's the lore.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.567
Sometimes the story's
more important

08:19.600 --> 08:21.034
than the truth, isn't it?

08:21.068 --> 08:24.271
Plus a heroic tale's good for
morale. Sows little seeds...

08:24.304 --> 08:25.539
Malcolm...
Yep?

08:25.573 --> 08:28.609
Just... the tree?

08:33.413 --> 08:35.215
There.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.138
Judging from
the bone structure,

09:31.171 --> 09:32.982
I'd say you have yourself
a middle-aged male...

09:33.006 --> 09:36.276
his right arm missing
below the elbow here.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.146
Can't tell yet if he lost it
before he died or after.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.081
It could've been
carried away by predators.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.417
Can you tell how long
he'd been buried there?

09:44.451 --> 09:45.753
Uh, going off
decomposition,

09:45.786 --> 09:48.388
I'd say
four to six years.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.558
What about a cause
of death?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.726
Well, I can tell you this.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.394
He could have been shot.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.528
That could be a bullet hole

09:55.562 --> 09:57.798
punching through
the rib there

09:57.831 --> 10:01.068
on its way passing
through the body.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.836
Did you tell Taylor
about this yet?

10:02.870 --> 10:05.238
I wasn't planning on it.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.641
Why not?

10:07.675 --> 10:09.977
When Boylan told me
where to find the body,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.712
he thought he was talking
to Taylor.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.915
Well, it seemed like
he was threatening

10:14.948 --> 10:16.850
to use it to expose
Taylor somehow.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.219
Well, you don't think...

10:19.252 --> 10:20.287
Taylor killed him?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.555
I think Taylor would do anything
if he thought it was

10:22.589 --> 10:23.900
in the best interest
of the colony.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.759
Right now I just
need some answers,

10:25.793 --> 10:28.829
starting with
who this was.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.531
Yeah. All right,
I'll do what I can.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.201
Thanks.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.469
Just do it quietly.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.171
Yeah.

10:50.383 --> 10:55.188
Castle, this is Squire One.
Now passing 400 klicks, over.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.591
- Squire One, Castle.
- I copy you at 400.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.928
Talk to you at 500. Out.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.246
We got Sixers!

11:19.279 --> 11:21.148
Incoming!

11:25.285 --> 11:26.653
Whoa! Whoa! Get out!

11:26.686 --> 11:28.221
On the ground!

11:33.560 --> 11:36.029
Don't move.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.934
Come on, come on, come on!

11:52.379 --> 11:54.347
Better?

11:58.685 --> 12:01.054
Why did you send me
to find that body?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.491
What body?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.127
By Pilgrim's Tree.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.629
You told me there
was something there.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.031
I found it.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.600
Logging a little
one-on-one time, Shannon?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.870
Such a beautiful spot.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.906
It's the perfect place for a...

12:18.939 --> 12:20.740
nap in the shade...

12:20.774 --> 12:21.809
What's he going on about?

12:21.842 --> 12:25.078
Oh, no idea.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.890
He's been blabbering like that
for 20 minutes.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.215
Thought maybe the, uh,

12:28.248 --> 12:31.785
good cop-bad cop angle
might yield some results.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.653
Did it?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.188
No.

12:35.222 --> 12:39.960
Well, I guess it's time
the bad cop got a turn.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.299
Lieutenant Washington!

12:46.333 --> 12:47.234
Yes, sir!

12:47.267 --> 12:50.804
Let Hope Plaza know
we're ready to receive!

12:50.838 --> 12:52.873
Hope Plaza, we're
ready to receive.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.007
Okay, good, guys.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.144
Sam, that's your cue.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.516
Sam needs to go
to the bathroom.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.718
Okay. Bathroom break.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.220
Everybody go now, please.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.289
Wash your hands. Zoe!
Zoe, leave the beard.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.590
Come on.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.928
Hey, kids, relax.
It's just a bug.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.430
Are you kidding?
This thing's huge!

13:22.035 --> 13:25.205
Sorry. Thought it might
bite one of the kids.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.774
Guys, you might
want to see this.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.142
What is it?

13:29.176 --> 13:32.279
I don't know. It's got
some sort of microchip on it.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.188
This is how Mira and her spy
have been communicating.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.790
It-It's the Cretaceous
equivalent of a carrier pigeon.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.025
You're telling me the Sixers

13:45.058 --> 13:47.427
have trained a bug to carry
messages back and forth?

13:47.460 --> 13:50.530
Yeah. I mean, insects respond
to powerful attractors...

13:50.563 --> 13:52.232
maybe a specific color,

13:52.265 --> 13:55.869
actually more likely a...
a scent or a sound.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.205
They must've figured
out how to lure it

13:58.238 --> 13:59.515
back and forth
between two locations.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.175
You gotta hand it to them
this is... ingenious.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.344
Well, you don't have to
sound so damn impressed.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.578
Sorry.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.947
This chip it was carrying.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.848
What's on it?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.884
Yeah, it was
damaged beyond repair.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.695
There's no way of knowing
what the message was,

14:12.719 --> 14:13.820
or who it was intended for.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.025
If we release the bug, let it
fly wherever it was going,

14:18.058 --> 14:19.993
wouldn't it take us to the spy?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.195
Yeah. Unfortunately,
the wings are damaged.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.064
Its flying days are over,
I'm afraid.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.937
Damn it, Malcolm, you got
any good news for me?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.867
Commander, we have a problem.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.203
Carry on.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.882
I'd just checked in with
them when they were hit.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.442
Mira?
She was at the lead.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.743
Corporal, report.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.478
They knew everything
about us, sir.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.480
What route we'd take,
what time we'd be there,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.815
how many of us were there.
Never had a chance.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.927
You get yourself
to the infirmary.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.053
Have Dr. Shannon
stitch up that gash.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.955
Check out the rest
of your team, as well.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.889
Yes, sir.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.025
I put that convoy together

14:52.059 --> 14:54.394
after you had Boylan
in the hole.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.998
He couldn't have told
Mira where to hit them.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.801
I don't trust that reptile.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.869
I suppose you're right.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.871
Let him go.
Sir.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.473
Mark!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.708
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.743
Hey. Yeah.
Oh, you're bleeding.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.980
Are you dizzy? You might
have a concussion. No.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.390
Look, you really don't
want to let that slide.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.025
I know, I know that
you might think... I know.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.450
M-M-Maddy. Maddy.
I'm, I'm fine.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.484
Really. Okay?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.258
I'm sorry.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.727
I, uh... I was just
really worried about you.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.163
No, no. D-Don't be sorry.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.865
I was just thinking I, uh...

15:32.899 --> 15:35.302
might like to get
ambushed more often.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.316
Any progress ID-ing
our little friend?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.118
It's a bit of a puzzle,
actually.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.619
His DNA doesn't match anyone

15:52.652 --> 15:55.188
who's come through the portal
since day one.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.290
Okay, so maybe
he's a stowaway.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.002
Someone who managed to
get through a Pilgrimage

15:59.026 --> 16:00.260
without being noticed.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.795
The problem is, he didn't come
through on any known Pilgrimage.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.031
How do you mean?

16:04.064 --> 16:07.034
Time displacement leaves
a molecular signature.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.037
So, everything that passes
through the portal

16:10.070 --> 16:12.539
is left with a sort
of trace imprint.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.708
So our guy doesn't have
a molecular signature?

16:15.742 --> 16:16.976
No, he does.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.680
It's just, it doesn't belong to
any Pilgrimage that's on record.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.715
According to my scans,
he came through the portal

16:22.749 --> 16:26.119
some time between the Second
and the Third Pilgrimages.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.887
How's that possible?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.157
You tell me.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.740
Wow. Love what you've
done with the place.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.741
We're closed.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.078
I gotta clean up the mess
that Taylor's men made

16:51.111 --> 16:52.712
after they ripped up the joint.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.781
I found the body.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.349
Under Pilgrim's Tree.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.988
Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.156
Yeah, well,
you were drugged,

17:03.190 --> 17:04.829
and then you confessed
to killing the guy.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.626
I did not!

17:08.494 --> 17:11.198
You do know what I'm talking
about all of a sudden.

17:16.136 --> 17:20.740
Look, all I did was help
Taylor bury the body.

17:20.772 --> 17:24.577
I have no idea how he got dead
or even who he was.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.486
I'm listening.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.426
Okay.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.397
A few years back, I'm on
patrol duty outside the gates.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.032
This is when you were
in the service, so

17:46.065 --> 17:47.800
that's what, five,
six years ago?

17:47.834 --> 17:48.901
Five.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.903
My last night
on active duty,

17:50.937 --> 17:52.205
and I see a light

17:52.239 --> 17:55.108
out in the jungle,
I hear a noise,

17:55.142 --> 17:56.776
and when I go
to check it out,

17:56.809 --> 17:59.212
Taylor's standing there
over this dead fellow...

17:59.246 --> 18:02.081
The one you dug up...
Wrapped in a blanket,

18:02.115 --> 18:04.451
and he looks up at me
and he goes,

18:04.484 --> 18:05.918
"You got to help me,
Tommy Boy."

18:05.952 --> 18:08.955
Tommy Boy, really?

18:08.988 --> 18:10.032
Well, believe it
or not, Shannon,

18:10.056 --> 18:13.126
the commander and I
used to be mates...

18:13.160 --> 18:14.894
Not so much
after that night, but yeah.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.967
Did Taylor say
what had happened?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.069
Taylor was a madman.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.271
He just kept going on

18:24.304 --> 18:26.038
about how the whole thing
was Lucas's fault.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.640
Lucas... Taylor's son?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.377
Anyway, Taylor
just kept saying.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.281
Lucas called the guy,
that the guy came

18:34.314 --> 18:36.816
through the portal because
Lucas asked him to come.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.794
But how did Taylor's son
play into how the guy died?

18:38.818 --> 18:39.852
I don't know,

18:39.886 --> 18:42.922
but that was the last night
anyone saw Lucas Taylor.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.758
You think the commander had
something to do with that?

18:47.560 --> 18:50.963
Taylor's a complete bastard...
And then some... but

18:50.997 --> 18:52.832
he loved his son.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.735
He, he'd rather slit his
own throat than hurt Lucas.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.070
What do you think
went down that night?

18:58.104 --> 18:59.272
You're the bloody cop

18:59.306 --> 19:02.008
I'm just a bartender.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.143
I mean, how would I know?

19:04.177 --> 19:06.413
You may not be a Sixer spy,

19:06.446 --> 19:08.348
but don't pretend
you don't know a little

19:08.381 --> 19:10.350
about everything
that goes on in this place.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.186
I strong-armed Taylor
into deeding me my bar

19:13.220 --> 19:16.889
in trade for
keeping his secret.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.392
I'm not about to risk that
by playing at guessing.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.194
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

19:21.228 --> 19:24.431
I'm going to go sleep
for about a month.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.576
Malcolm, what
are you doing?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.446
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.915
What is all this?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.884
Work... mine,
not yours.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.919
You have no right
to unlock my work drawer.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.322
I am Chief Science Officer
for all of Terra Nova.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.390
Your work is my work.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.724
Now, what is all this?

19:54.261 --> 19:56.296
Well, I'm performing
an autopsy.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.799
A... on a,
a five-year-old skeleton?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.868
Yes.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.003
Well, where'd it come from?
What happened to it?

20:04.036 --> 20:04.871
I'm working
on it, okay?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.315
Look, I'm sorry, why
do you need to know?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.774
Because
you don't want me to,

20:07.807 --> 20:11.478
and I like having
secrets in my own lab.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.246
Oh, Malcolm, you could
never keep your nose

20:13.280 --> 20:15.382
out of other people's
work, could you?

20:15.415 --> 20:19.185
Have you told
Commander Taylor about this?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.653
I'm waiting till I know more

20:20.687 --> 20:23.556
before I bother
the commander with it.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.058
You still don't understand
much about protocol

20:26.092 --> 20:27.260
around here, do you?

20:27.294 --> 20:29.962
Or are you just
playing dumb?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.202
I'll be back

20:36.235 --> 20:38.438
with Commander Taylor.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.341
I woke up
yesterday morning

20:41.374 --> 20:42.709
to an anonymous
note on my door

20:42.742 --> 20:46.313
saying that there was a body
buried out by Pilgrim's Tree,

20:46.346 --> 20:50.149
so I went to take a
look, and there he was.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.552
I'd like to see the note.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.522
I'll check to see
if I still have it.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.493
Do that.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.462
You say you didn't know
anything about this?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.531
No, not until a
few minutes ago.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.974
I figured he was
just some poor sap...

21:05.998 --> 21:08.868
Wandered outside the gates
and became slasher bait.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.871
Slasher even took his arm
as a souvenir, you know.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.110
Don't think so.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.912
Nah, got to be a Sixer.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.691
I've always thought
at least some of 'em

21:22.715 --> 21:24.283
must have falsified
their DNA labs

21:24.317 --> 21:27.186
to cover up
their criminal records.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.287
Well, that
would explain

21:28.321 --> 21:30.623
why he's not showing
up on the database.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.292
I appreciate the fact
you don't want me distracted

21:33.326 --> 21:35.495
from other things...
Boylan, the Sixers,

21:35.528 --> 21:39.466
whatever... but, you know,
something like this,

21:39.499 --> 21:42.502
you really do need
to be keep me apprised of it.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.974
It won't happen again.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.576
No harm done.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.411
You're still new here,

21:51.444 --> 21:54.581
still got
a few things to learn.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.584
Shannon.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.371
Taylor suspects
we're onto him.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.440
What do you want to do?

22:20.473 --> 22:23.376
I don't even have
an I.D. on the victim,

22:23.410 --> 22:25.778
let alone a motive for
why Taylor killed him.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.947
If Taylor thinks you're
building a case against him,

22:27.980 --> 22:30.216
he's not just going
to take that lying down.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.952
No, he's not.

22:32.985 --> 22:37.256
Okay, let's run
it from the top.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.593
Citizens of the future,

22:40.627 --> 22:45.297
we're here to give humanity
a fresh start,

22:45.331 --> 22:47.767
embracing the principles

22:47.800 --> 22:52.171
of justice, fairness and trust.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.339
You have place your trust

22:53.372 --> 22:57.977
in me, and you have my word,

22:58.010 --> 23:03.950
today and until my final day,
that it's an honor.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.420
I will never betray you.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.659
Malcolm.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.226
Commander, thank
you for coming.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.762
What's on your mind?

23:15.795 --> 23:17.430
I figured out what
the Sixers are using

23:17.464 --> 23:18.507
to draw the dragonfly
back and forward.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.433
It's a sonic signature.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.401
You see, unlike their
modern age cousins,

23:22.435 --> 23:23.836
dragonflies
from this era

23:23.870 --> 23:25.838
have timpanic membranes
on their antennae

23:25.872 --> 23:28.407
capable of hearing sounds
from miles away.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.978
Right. I used
a tuning fork.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.448
I was able to identify
the specific frequency

23:35.482 --> 23:38.350
that the dragonfly is
trained to home in on.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.521
I don't hear anything.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.623
No, 'cause you're
not a dragonfly.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.825
It's a subsonic signature.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.260
Only certain insects are
capable of hearing it.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.162
42.8 Hertz to be precise.

23:50.196 --> 23:53.199
You know, Malcolm, I am all for
the onward march of science,

23:53.232 --> 23:56.703
but I just don't see how this is
going to help me catch a spy.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.571
It seems to me
that whoever it is,

23:58.605 --> 24:01.741
has got to be wondering why they
didn't get their last message, right?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.142
So, it stands to reason

24:03.175 --> 24:06.145
that they're still broadcasting
the homing frequency.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.379
That's a big
assumption.

24:07.413 --> 24:10.583
Look, a lot of people saw Dunham
swat that bug out of the air.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.619
If I'm the spy, I shut
down my transmitter.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.186
If they didn't,

24:14.220 --> 24:17.890
then the dragonfly will lead us
right to the spy's front door.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.492
Just as you suggested yesterday.

24:19.526 --> 24:23.663
If they didn't, and if the dragonfly
could fly, but the fly can't fly.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.065
I saved the best
bit for last.

24:35.107 --> 24:38.678
I managed to surgically
repair its wing.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.818
Malcolm, you're all right.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.054
I don't care
what anybody says.

24:48.087 --> 24:52.859
We're going to release it while
everybody's at the festival.

24:52.892 --> 24:58.965
And you, you're going to take us
right to the spy, aren't you?

25:30.329 --> 25:34.333
Okay, so I put a locator chip
in its leg so we can track it.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.168
We all good?
Bugs away.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.647
Come on, fella.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.481
Fly you stupid bug.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.751
Go to your master.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.194
Okay, got it.
Let's go.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.765
Where'd it go?
Over there, by the probe.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.938
Come on, Reynolds,
you're with us.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.742
Seven years ago, mankind entered

26:15.775 --> 26:18.544
its darkest and most
desperate hour.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.549
Food was scarce,
the air difficult to breathe.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.653
Our world was dying,

26:26.686 --> 26:30.890
and then a rip in time
was discovered,

26:30.923 --> 26:33.960
and a bold new opportunity
loomed for mankind.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.863
But who would lead

26:36.896 --> 26:40.166
this glorious mission?

26:45.537 --> 26:48.340
Commander Nathaniel Taylor.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.442
General Philbrick, sir.

26:50.476 --> 26:51.844
Welcome my old friend.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.612
It's been a long time.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.082
Too long, sir.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.652
We have served side by side
on many missions, my friend,

26:59.686 --> 27:02.088
and now I have the honor

27:02.121 --> 27:04.957
of sending you
on the greatest mission of all.

27:04.991 --> 27:08.227
Philbrick only had one arm.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.939
Are you thinking what
I think you're thinking?

27:10.963 --> 27:14.767
There's a play going on.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.468
Let's talk.
Yeah.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.604
We'll be right back.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.306
Where are you going?

27:33.786 --> 27:35.121
Where'd it go?
Did we lose it?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.691
It says it went
into the house.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.293
Is this the house
I think it is?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.228
Can't be.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.596
The Shannons.

27:44.630 --> 27:48.835
Could that body you found really
be the General Richard Philbrick?

27:48.868 --> 27:51.603
He lost his arm in
Mogadishu, I think it was.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.540
Yeah, but I remember seeing
something on the news a few years ago

27:54.573 --> 27:57.309
about him being killed in
South America or somewhere.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.579
No, he went missing, but I don't
think a body was ever found.

28:00.612 --> 28:01.948
Okay, what if
you're right?

28:01.981 --> 28:03.816
What if it is Philbrick?

28:03.850 --> 28:07.887
Who sent him here, and
why all the secrecy?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.688
Philbrick was Taylor's
commanding officer.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.390
The only reason I can think of

28:11.423 --> 28:14.727
for why anyone would
send him back here would be

28:14.761 --> 28:15.771
to relieve Taylor
of his command.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.197
James Shannon.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.167
I'm placing you under arrest.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.102
I'm charging you
with conspiracy

28:23.135 --> 28:25.237
and endangering the welfare
of this colony.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.906
What? We found
evidence in your house

28:26.939 --> 28:29.608
that proves you've been
communicating with the Sixers.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.643
You're working
for Mira.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.145
You're the spy, Shannon.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.247
This is absurd.
Where's the evidence?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.315
Take him.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.585
Well... Jim. You
got to be kidding me.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.921
Let him go!
What the...

28:42.688 --> 28:43.990
Shannon, I suggest

28:44.023 --> 28:46.058
we do this quietly, peacefully.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.060
Let's not ruin
the festivities for everyone.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.362
This is wrong.
You're lying.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.764
Elisabeth.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.232
Take him away, Reynolds.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.390
We got ourselves a
situation here, Shannon.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.393
Damn it, Taylor,
I am not the Sixer spy,

29:21.427 --> 29:22.795
and you know it.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.965
You know what
I think, Shannon.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.300
I think that
there might be

29:28.334 --> 29:30.202
a perfectly
reasonable and innocent

29:30.236 --> 29:32.204
explanation to the how and why.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.841
Mira's dragonfly ended up
on your doorstep.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.775
Now, if that should
prove to be the case,

29:36.809 --> 29:38.777
I'm happy to move on,

29:38.811 --> 29:40.880
find myself the real spy.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.549
Preferably with your help.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.217
So, in other words,

29:45.251 --> 29:48.888
if I drop my investigation,
we're all good.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.024
Do we have an
understanding?

29:52.624 --> 29:55.127
Sorry.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.065
So am I.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.302
I'm not letting this go
till I get to the truth.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.503
You want to stop me,

30:04.536 --> 30:07.039
you lock that door
and throw away the key.

30:08.774 --> 30:11.043
Why'd you kill
General Philbrick?

30:19.718 --> 30:22.354
If I hadn't, he would
have killed me.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.923
Why?

30:23.956 --> 30:26.125
'Cause you refused
to step down?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.827
Refused to let him
relieve you of your command?

30:28.861 --> 30:32.031
Damn right I refused.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.666
The people who sent Philbrick
are the same people

30:34.700 --> 30:36.768
who sent the Sixers.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.670
They want me out.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.739
They want me dead.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.841
'Cause I got onto
what they're planning.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.776
Which is what exactly?

30:44.810 --> 30:47.279
These people,
these vile people...

30:47.313 --> 30:51.850
They don't see Terra Nova
as a second chance for humanity.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.252
To them, it's another place

30:53.285 --> 30:55.955
to strip and plunder
for all it's worth.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.024
A commodity,

30:58.057 --> 31:02.861
an infinite pipeline to pump
precious resources into 2149

31:02.895 --> 31:05.431
to line their own
filthy pockets,

31:05.464 --> 31:07.266
to squeeze

31:07.299 --> 31:10.302
till Terra Nova gives up
its last breath of life.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.971
But the pipeline

31:12.004 --> 31:14.306
doesn't go from here to there.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.743
The fracture only goes one way.

31:17.776 --> 31:20.947
If my son has anything
to say about it,

31:20.980 --> 31:22.982
that's going to change.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.551
What has Lucas got to do

31:25.584 --> 31:27.253
with all of this?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.656
He came in
on the Second Pilgrimage.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.625
About the proudest day
of my life.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.628
My boy.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.397
Father and son

31:38.430 --> 31:42.868
gonna fight to build a
brave, new world together.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.404
But what I didn't know was...

31:47.106 --> 31:49.708
...he was on the other side,

31:49.741 --> 31:52.344
on their side from the get-go.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.280
He was working on calculations

31:54.313 --> 31:57.116
to make the portal go
both ways.

31:58.985 --> 32:02.121
When I found out
what he was doing...

32:04.223 --> 32:08.160
...I destroyed all his work.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.135
He hated me
from that minute on.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.871
Two days later,
he went OTG.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.974
I followed him.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.911
Lucas, what are you doing here?

32:25.944 --> 32:29.681
I'm, uh, waiting for a friend.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.650
What friend?

32:33.919 --> 32:36.522
And there,

32:36.555 --> 32:38.991
impossibly...

32:39.025 --> 32:41.960
There was
General Richard Philbrick.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.702
What the hell's going on here?

32:50.736 --> 32:52.604
Consider it a palace coup.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.406
General?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.442
I'm here to replace you,
soldier.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.112
I'm in command
of Terra Nova now.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.181
Over my dead body, sir.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.449
Hope Plaza assured...

33:03.482 --> 33:05.317
Hope Plaza has nothing
to do with it.

33:05.351 --> 33:08.954
They're not in charge of
Terra Nova, never have been.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.322
What are you talking about?

33:10.356 --> 33:11.933
There are bigger players
involved here, son.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.025
Best you just step down

33:13.059 --> 33:14.993
graciously, Nathaniel.

33:15.027 --> 33:18.730
And the good General tried
to relieve me

33:18.764 --> 33:20.899
then and there
of my duty.

33:20.932 --> 33:22.434
And I refused,

33:22.468 --> 33:24.570
and the General
tried to kill me.

33:24.603 --> 33:29.241
And so I found myself having
to kill my mentor.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.721
And as if

33:42.754 --> 33:47.259
that wasn't bad enough,
I still to deal with my son.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.313
Ah, go ahead, kill me.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.551
You're my son.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.255
I won't do it.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.193
You're a traitor.

34:21.226 --> 34:25.364
There's no place in Terra Nova
for you.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.766
I never want to see
your face again.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.572
You'll see me
again, Commander.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.678
Just hope I show you
the kindness you showed me.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.687
And that's the last time
I saw of him.

34:50.054 --> 34:53.725
That was five years ago.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.429
He never stopped working
on those calculations.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.631
He'd write them on rocks
for me to find.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.434
Almost like he was
taunting me.

35:04.836 --> 35:11.677
And... you've kept this
to yourself this whole time?

35:11.710 --> 35:13.721
If the people of Terra Nova knew
that all the blood,

35:13.745 --> 35:16.715
sweat and tears they've put
into building this place

35:16.748 --> 35:17.683
was built on a lie,

35:17.716 --> 35:19.518
and would probably come
to absolutely nothing,

35:19.551 --> 35:22.354
well, they might as well
lay down and die

35:22.388 --> 35:26.124
and forget the whole damn thing.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.126
I won't allow that to happen.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.996
I'll fight with
everything I've got

35:31.029 --> 35:34.300
even if I have to do it alone.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.346
You're free to go.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.656
You know, uh,

35:57.689 --> 36:00.759
you really didn't have
to take it this far.

36:00.792 --> 36:04.763
You have to forgive me
for playing rough, Jim,

36:04.796 --> 36:08.200
but then again,
we are talking about the fate

36:08.234 --> 36:10.168
of the human race here.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.170
My own son is out there
formulating

36:12.204 --> 36:13.972
an equation that'll allow

36:14.005 --> 36:18.176
his friends on the other side
to have their way with our home.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.078
If you were in my place,

36:20.111 --> 36:22.113
would you bow,

36:22.147 --> 36:25.016
would you let those people

36:25.050 --> 36:26.218
do here in Terra Nova

36:26.252 --> 36:30.889
what they did to the Earth
we left behind?

36:30.922 --> 36:32.658
Or would you fight?

36:36.127 --> 36:39.531
I would fight.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.804
I will fight.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.020
Jim?

37:02.053 --> 37:04.122
It's okay. I'm okay.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.924
Mr. Shannon is free to go.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.994
I thought you said that
he was a Sixer spy, sir.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.161
I was mistaken.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.697
Our spy's still
out there somewhere.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.366
But the dragonfly led us
straight to his place.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.835
It followed
a specific frequency.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.513
Apparently, the very same
frequency emitted

37:18.537 --> 37:21.507
by Shannon's pistol charger.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.576
Wash, you and Reynolds
are dismissed.

37:24.610 --> 37:25.677
Sir.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.982
My apologies
for the misunderstanding.

37:31.016 --> 37:34.986
Even here in paradise,
we're victimized by technology.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.425
Enjoy your evening.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.860
Okay.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.368
My dragonfly did not follow
the frequency

37:49.401 --> 37:51.069
of a bloody pistol charger.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.103
Your dragonfly?

37:52.137 --> 37:53.605
What did you do,

37:53.639 --> 37:56.908
plant an emitter broadcasting
at 32.8 in his house?

37:56.942 --> 37:59.445
And if I did?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.549
Then I'd ask you why.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.887
Enjoy the festival,
Malcolm.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.295
Taylor's son was behind
the whole thing.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.831
I know. I couldn't
believe it either.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.033
We got an uphill
battle ahead of us.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.268
Did you see,
did you see?!

38:23.301 --> 38:26.137
Yeah, baby I did,
and you were terrific!

38:26.171 --> 38:27.105
Incredible.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.074
Mark, did you see?

38:29.107 --> 38:30.342
Commander Taylor, sir!

38:30.376 --> 38:32.611
It's me.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.246
Zoe? I could've sworn that
you were Commander Taylor.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.315
He's silly.
Yeah.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.884
He is silly.
You know why?

38:38.917 --> 38:41.286
Because Commander
Taylor's nowhere near

38:41.319 --> 38:43.188
as cute as you.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.457
Mr. Shannon, sir,
would you mind

38:45.491 --> 38:47.225
if I stole your daughter
away for a dance?

38:49.961 --> 38:51.497
Knock yourselves out.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.504
Go on.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.039
Zoe.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.187
Welcome to the Harvest Festival.

39:20.959 --> 39:26.832
Today we make the time
to take a reckoning

39:26.865 --> 39:29.635
of everything
that we've accomplished together

39:29.668 --> 39:32.438
and to give thanks
for everything we have.

39:32.471 --> 39:36.842
And today, we welcome
our newest Terra Novan...

39:36.875 --> 39:42.280
Paul and Bea Duncan have added
a baby boy to our community.

39:44.716 --> 39:50.622
Say hello to Alexander
Nathaniel Duncan.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.790
Oh, me?

39:53.525 --> 39:55.160
Come on.
I got ya.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.803
This is what Terra Nova's
all about.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.105
Oh, oh, here, go to Mama.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.313
About good friends and family
and loved ones.

40:15.346 --> 40:18.750
We're all in this together.

40:18.784 --> 40:23.722
Without all of you,
I'd have nothing.

40:23.755 --> 40:31.597
You're my friends, my family,
my loved ones.

40:35.166 --> 40:39.070
And today I give thanks
for each and every one of you.
