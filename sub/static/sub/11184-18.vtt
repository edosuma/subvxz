00:02.870 --> 00:04.144
What's your favorite game?

00:04.204 --> 00:06.844
Stay up late and do anything I want.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.727
Ground control has taken over.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.797
Word is getting out that you
are losing control of her.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.945
Look, swing around to starboard.
I'll get a better angle.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.911
Yeah, this is just the shot Mr. Desoto wants.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.600
No! Not that one, Rox.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.534
Hey Dom, something's wrong.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.669
Get some altitude so we
can see what's going on.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.735
You got it.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.280
Roxy!

03:56.403 --> 03:59.782
- Get somebody over here.
- Hey, you okay? You hurt?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.285
- What happened?
- You all right?

04:01.341 --> 04:05.847
I'll tell you what happened. You used the
mike stand instead of the rubber wand.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.485
Wand?

04:07.547 --> 04:09.083
Yeah, the rubber wand.

04:09.149 --> 04:13.962
The UFO picks up an electrostatic charge
from the chopper blades, remember?

04:15.489 --> 04:17.992
You grounded yourself with the mike stand.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.964
Okay, okay, okay.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.098
- Look, how many times do we have to
rehearse this?
- That's why we do rehearsals.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.268
We'll do it one more time, she'll get it…

04:25.332 --> 04:27.141
Nick, I'm going back to the hotel.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.510
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's
just finish it. Do the rehearsal…

04:30.570 --> 04:33.642
You finish it, Nick. And you tell this
toadie-roadie to get it straight,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.709
otherwise, I'm not doing the concert.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.518
Oh absolutely, Miss Roxy.

04:38.578 --> 04:42.458
I'll be glad to change the laws of
physics for you. You just say the word!

04:42.516 --> 04:46.726
Don't talk to her like that! Now
she's a superstar. You respect her.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.466
Come on.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.574
Santini, come in.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.806
Pick up Miss Roxy and take
her back to the hotel.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.779
You pick her up, String. Cate and
me’ll go back to the hangar.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.409
With pleasure.

05:09.709 --> 05:13.156
Nick, I know he told me to use
the wand. It's just that I was so…

05:13.213 --> 05:16.353
You’re tired. You’re tired. I understand.

05:16.583 --> 05:20.053
But you're a pro. You'll
come through. You always have.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.926
I know.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.494
But sometimes I wonder
who I'm do’n these shows for.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.735
Am I doing it for them, for
me, for you, for your 20%?

05:30.797 --> 05:35.075
Don't take shots at me, Roxy. That
20% doesn't make up for losing you,

05:35.168 --> 05:37.478
and I'd give it back in a minute.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.246
Stay with me tonight.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.310
Oh Nick, please don't start that again.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.348
What do ya want?

05:47.547 --> 05:51.461
I'm standing by to take her back to her
hotel if you're done with your rehearsal.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.763
Okay.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.569
Take Roxy back to the hotel.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.769
Take it easy.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.203
Special handling, all right?

06:05.265 --> 06:08.735
And this time, will you stay up in the
sky until I tell you to come down

06:08.802 --> 06:10.975
like nice flyboys, okay?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.246
That's what us flyboys do best.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.389
I'll be ready to go in a minute.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.321
I'll wait for you outside.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.413
Ya’ll set?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.126
What's that in the back? Is that a camera?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.729
We're gonna shoot some footage for the concert.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.827
Gonna make me look good?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.340
Wouldn't have to do much
to make you look good.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.705
Thank you.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.904
I saw your concert last year.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.275
You looked good even from the last row.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.646
What were you do’n in the last row?

07:18.705 --> 07:21.743
Don't even ask. The thing was a sell-out, so…

07:21.808 --> 07:24.084
I had to buy some scalper's tickets.

07:24.144 --> 07:29.253
Cost me, but I just had to
hear you sing “Curse of Love.”

07:30.617 --> 07:32.324
That old thing?

07:33.186 --> 07:36.963
It's the first thing Nick
and I ever did. I was 18.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.264
Are you gonna record another album soon?

07:39.326 --> 07:42.102
I will if I stay with Nick Desoto.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.267
He's gotta be on the charts all the time.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.072
Hey listen, I'm sorry if I
interrupted anything personal.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.272
Oh no, no, you didn't.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.715
Nick and I have that discussion
about 8 or 9 times a week.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.886
You see, we're divorced, but both of
our names are on the business contract.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.924
So it's just like we're married.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.620
It gets pretty confusing,
and I know it's got to change,

08:02.682 --> 08:05.788
but that's the “Curse of Love.”

08:33.413 --> 08:35.289
Hi, how ya'll doing?

08:36.383 --> 08:38.328
Hawke, how did they get up here?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.029
Come on, I'll help you out.

08:44.991 --> 08:48.700
Excuse us please. Come on, guys,
let the lady through. Excuse me.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.905
Come on in, Hawke.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.350
These aren't bad, as far as hotels go.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.851
And believe me, I know a lot about hotels.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.252
Where do you live?

09:08.314 --> 09:09.315
Hotels.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.256
I'm sorry. Make yourself
a drink if you want one.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.660
2 more weeks.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.136
2 more weeks, and then what?

09:25.165 --> 09:28.874
Well, then the tour is over. The
recording sessions are done

09:29.269 --> 09:31.875
and then it's Roxy's time to play.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.916
Play? What's your favorite game?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.578
It's called superstar in Paris.

09:38.144 --> 09:42.615
I shop, go to the clubs, stay
up late and do anyth’n I want.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.996
And live in hotels.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.503
And what do you do, Mr. Hawke?
I mean, to relax.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.437
I've got a cabin up in the mountains.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.036
I'm go’n up there tomorrow.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.542
What are you, some kinda hermit?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.053
No, I've got a couple of friends go’n with me.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.489
I'll be back in time for
your technical rehearsal.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.655
And I was think’n…

10:16.883 --> 10:18.692
well, it is a 4-place chopper.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.004
Hello.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.910
Yes, I'll tell him.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.008
I know. They want me to get
my machine off the roof, huh?

10:42.575 --> 10:44.577
Just kind of lost track of time.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.589
I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.024
Maybe.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.960
Maybe sooner.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.603
Look, I don't know what to
tell you, pal. He's not here.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.274
It's not worth breaking
you in half to find out.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.511
Just remind Desoto about his weekend in Vegas.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.585
He lost.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.545
And he owes.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.861
1, 2, 3… can you hear that okay?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.495
Those guys don't scare me.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.170
Not your hide they're after.

11:39.732 --> 11:43.111
$100,000? Easy off the next album's budget.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.479
Rusty, she's flak’n out on us.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.075
She may not do the album or anymore shows.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.779
Well then, you've gotta get
control of her again, Nick.

11:49.842 --> 11:53.187
I know that. I've been trying
everything I can think. Nothing works.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.350
I've gotta talk to her.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.140
Look at me.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.701
I'm less worried about getting
my legs broke than losing her.

12:13.766 --> 12:14.904
Nick,

12:15.235 --> 12:19.684
suppose I could guarantee her co-operation,
at least as far as finish’n the tour?

12:20.006 --> 12:21.144
How?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.220
Just something I saw on
television. It might work.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.922
Try it.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.678
What? Are you sure?

13:26.606 --> 13:29.018
I can't believe it!

13:29.075 --> 13:30.281
Nick.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.280
Rusty, she split.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.987
She flew off to the woods with
those jerks from Santini Air.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.530
I mean, I can't believe
she would do that to me.

13:39.585 --> 13:43.863
It doesn't matter. It's okay.
It's gonna work out.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.164
Watch. Come on in.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.012
Amazing.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.009
And the audience will never know.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.186
Might work.

14:07.714 --> 14:11.287
You remind me of someone I used to need.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.183
Boy, when you said mountains
you weren't kidding, were you?

14:42.281 --> 14:43.282
No.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.326
It's worth it, coming up here.

14:49.989 --> 14:54.096
I saw a pregnant doe when I was here
last week. It might have foaled by now.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.840
When are we going to see someth’n?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.936
Well, sometimes we come up here
and we don't see anything at all.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.677
Are you bored?

15:06.472 --> 15:08.076
I don't know what I am.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.114
It's the first time in 5 years
that I've been away from Nick.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.054
Boy, you wouldn't catch him
doing something like this.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.753
Everything he does is fast and furious.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.129
Yeah, well, you can't keep a
pace like that up forever.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.168
Try telling Nick that.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.601
Have you ever tried telling Nick that?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.409
We climbed to the top together.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.036
It's hard to forget that.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.047
Even when the love is gone.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.579
You were right.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.639
Anybody else want some more of this coffee?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.404
No, thanks.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.336
That was the best meal I've ever had.

16:09.402 --> 16:13.179
Well you see, the fresh air
titillates the taste buds.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.378
Especially with fresh caught fish.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.388
Not to mention my skill
with the cast iron skillet.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.856
Ho, ho, ho. Let's not forget.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.159
Silence.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.593
It's a pretty strange sound.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.602
That's how you tell good friends.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.071
When you can be quiet together.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.143
I keep hearing the echo of cheering fans.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.977
A couple of weeks out of the
city, you can hear the crickets.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.017
Might take a lot longer in my case.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.983
I've got a lot of noise to forget.

16:51.744 --> 16:55.783
Oh, well, I've had it. Good night.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.920
Yeah, me too. Listen, you
guys bring in the coffee pot.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.926
Good night.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.433
Hasta la noche.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.468
This is so beautiful.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.605
Where have I been all my life?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.746
Where have you been?

17:16.301 --> 17:18.373
Back in the last row, scalping tickets.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.993
Hawke, I'm not going back there.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.298
Nick is through.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.798
What are you going to do
about your last concert?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.931
Let the scalpers take the loss.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.891
See you later.

18:07.186 --> 18:11.760
Nick Desoto, Mickey, Sal. I've
used them before. They're good.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.061
Did you explain the job?

18:15.361 --> 18:18.638
If you give the word,
we'll detain the lady for you.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.441
I don't want her hurt, and it's
got to be done discretely.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.345
Discrete is the only way
we do kidnapping, mister,

18:25.404 --> 18:27.213
see’n as how it's a felony.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.151
It may never come to that,

18:32.011 --> 18:35.515
but this, this is standby money.

18:52.498 --> 18:56.378
That was wonderful. I've never
seen so much open country before.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.083
Get ready for some of the best soul
food home cook’n you've ever had.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.480
That's Roxanne Marvel.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.882
Yeah, I'm tell’n you. That's Roxanne Marvel.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.527
I'm gonna go… I'm gonna go check it out.

19:12.518 --> 19:16.364
Hawke, I don't want a mob scene.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.700
Can we get out of here?

19:18.758 --> 19:23.104
Roxanne Marvel. I knew it. I knew it.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.768
That's right. How you doing?

19:25.865 --> 19:28.436
How am I doing? You kidding me?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.846
With Roxy Marvel in my
favorite little honky-tonk?

19:31.904 --> 19:36.819
Hey girl, you ever dance a
2-step with a real mountain man?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.651
- No, I don't think…
- Come on, come on with me.

19:41.747 --> 19:45.285
Don't you think you're just be’n
a little rude with the lady?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.194
I think you're mak’n a big mistake.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.401
Look it, cowboy, I don't
want any trouble with you.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.801
Stop.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.472
Please stop, stop.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.718
I'm sorry about my friend. He's drunk.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.455
He should've known better.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.638
Look.

20:31.363 --> 20:35.175
You see? You are respected and you're admired.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.982
They want a piece of me.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.251
Everybody wants a piece of me.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.984
You give them a piece of you
every time you sing a song.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.053
Roxanne, it's your life.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.629
But you have a different kind of life.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.189
You have a professional and a personal life,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.462
and they have to be separated.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.673
It's in your blood, isn't it? Singing.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.834
I know it's in my blood.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.201
Singing is my first love.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.072
But I'm just burned out

21:13.773 --> 21:17.118
from overdo’n it, from
hav’n Nick push me too hard.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.912
Like I said, it's your life.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.688
If it were me,

21:23.949 --> 21:26.930
I'd finish the tour, and I'd fire Desoto.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.393
Of course, you're always welcome

21:30.823 --> 21:33.133
to come back up to the cabin
and stay as long as you want.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.309
But you have to go out like a pro.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.647
Hey Dom, it looks like they're gonna
start the technical rehearsal.

22:19.705 --> 22:23.949
Holy cats! We better hightail it back to
the hangar and pick up that other camera.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.080
They want film of all the rehearsals.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.022
I forgot it was at 2:00 today.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.855
Come on String, let's go.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.369
Nick?

22:46.098 --> 22:48.009
Hello, Ms. Marvel.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.684
Sally, would you wait outside
for a moment please?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.316
Okay.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.584
Nick, what the hell is going on here?

23:05.284 --> 23:07.924
Won't you ever learn to knock?

23:16.896 --> 23:17.966
Nick?

23:22.201 --> 23:24.704
Okay. Watch your step. Watch the wires.

23:24.770 --> 23:28.513
- Would you get ready for some playback for
me, Rusty?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.485
“Out of the Sky,” all right?

23:30.676 --> 23:33.054
Here's your microphone,
sweetheart, right there…

23:33.112 --> 23:34.614
Oh, don't hold it by the antenna.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.752
Hold it right here. Hey Rusty,
let's have some playback.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.456
Okay?

23:39.518 --> 23:41.555
Okay. Playback coming up.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.833
Okay, back up.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.233
That's it.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.297
Here we go!

23:50.529 --> 23:52.531
That's it. Just a little bit.
Just be comfortable.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.771
Just move the way you want to. That's it!

23:55.467 --> 23:59.313
Just make sure you keep the microphone
in front of your lips all the time.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.648
That way if you don't know the words,
they won't know the difference. Go!

24:03.809 --> 24:05.220
You have to keep it in front of your mouth.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.679
♪ …Moline. ♪

24:06.745 --> 24:08.088
That's it, big smile!

24:08.147 --> 24:09.148
That's right.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.454
That's it, now. Cover your mouth.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.623
I don't know if this is gonna work.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.927
You're do’n great. You're
do’n great. Believe me.

24:15.988 --> 24:19.401
Do that. That's it. That's it.
You're gonna be great!

24:24.430 --> 24:26.876
All right Cate, stand by.
We're com’n into position.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.002
Okay.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.947
Drop down 100 feet String,
so I can get a lower angle.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.482
All right, make your run.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.951
Start your camera roll’n.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.284
We can't fly over the crowd. I'll
swing around the other side.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.657
Hold her steady, String.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.638
Stay on the stage area, Cate.

24:54.793 --> 24:55.794
Great.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.205
She really shines down there.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.142
Oh, wait.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.628
I say zoom in at the end of the
verse. Cut to the musicians.

25:24.857 --> 25:25.961
Okay?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.561
Okay, yeah, I think we got it.

25:27.626 --> 25:28.832
Cut!

25:28.961 --> 25:29.962
Great.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.201
Hey, you're gonna be great. Take
a bow for your millions of fans.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.939
Big bow. Keep your face up.
That's it. Big bow!

25:37.002 --> 25:39.573
All right, Roxy!

25:41.206 --> 25:42.276
Come on.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.422
Okay, go ahead and roll that thing, Dom.
Let's have a look at these test shots.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.022
We're gonna have to watch our
f-stop when we're film’n tonight

25:56.088 --> 25:58.159
or we'll end up underexposed.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.904
Hey, not bad, huh?

26:00.993 --> 26:03.269
Yeah, that's fine. It'll work real good.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.275
Hey, good stuff, Cate.
It's gonna make a great video.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.070
You know, she's really very photogenic.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.214
What was… Hawke, I think I saw something.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.086
Hey Dom, roll it back.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.089
Hey, look at those 2 guys.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.089
Yeah, what are they doing?

26:29.154 --> 26:31.293
Looks like they're hassling somebody.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.773
Freeze the frame.

26:40.199 --> 26:44.113
You know, Dom, I must have taken this when I
leaned back on the camera to talk to you.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.807
Can anybody make out that license number?

26:45.871 --> 26:47.748
That's Roxanne!

26:47.806 --> 26:50.218
They kidnapped Roxanne!

26:50.843 --> 26:54.586
Oh, they couldn't have. She was
on the stage all the time.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.184
- Who is it?
- It's Hawke.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.201
Here you go.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.569
Well…

27:08.627 --> 27:11.836
well, it's like I told you before,
I'm not after an autograph.

27:12.531 --> 27:16.673
Look, you're all dolls and I love ya, but…

27:16.735 --> 27:18.772
I got a show to do, okay?

27:19.371 --> 27:20.907
Listen,

27:20.973 --> 27:24.978
I'd just like to know if Desoto's
giving you trouble or not.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.715
You want me to call Security?

27:33.986 --> 27:38.230
I guess she's still got the sound of
those cheering fans ring’n in her ears.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.229
Hey, what are you people doing back here?

27:42.294 --> 27:43.773
We came to see Roxanne.

27:45.364 --> 27:49.471
I'm sorry, nobody backstage.
Mr. Desoto's orders.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.977
Yeah, you know, I'd like to talk to Mr. Desoto.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.343
Do you understand English? Nobody backstage.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.984
Come on String, it's not
worth it. Come on, come on.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.695
You can't be serious.

28:13.692 --> 28:18.368
It was $100,000, not $125,000.

28:18.997 --> 28:23.002
That is the problem with borrowing
from our institution, Nicky,

28:23.068 --> 28:25.639
the interest rates float.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.644
Well, I'll need some more time.

28:28.774 --> 28:32.745
Look, the way we figure it,
you got only one asset.

28:32.811 --> 28:37.226
And the word is gett’n out that you
are losing control of her. You fix it

28:37.449 --> 28:40.692
so that one asset stays put.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.858
Either that, or liquidate it.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.059
Liquidate it?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.563
What the hell are you talking about?

28:49.628 --> 28:53.599
Hey, you are the man with a dozen hits.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.406
You figure it out.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.421
How did those guys get in? Where have you been?

29:06.478 --> 29:09.823
Those guys from Santini Air
have been snooping around.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.019
Damn!

29:11.083 --> 29:15.930
Hey, I told you. I got a chopper license.
I should be flying that UFO.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.733
Who's gonna film the concert?

29:20.792 --> 29:21.930
I don't know.

29:21.994 --> 29:26.943
Videos are important to album sales.
We gotta stick with Santini now.

29:32.471 --> 29:36.146
Those guys just walk right on in here.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.984
We gotta have some kind
of protection around here.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.984
Mickey and Sal got a little sideline going.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.754
Mickey and Sal?

29:43.815 --> 29:46.659
Arms for the serious investor,
if you know what I mean.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.356
What kind of stuff?

29:49.788 --> 29:52.860
Heavy enough to bring down a
chopper, if it comes to that.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.885
I'll admit there's something fishy back there,

30:19.951 --> 30:22.295
but I don't see what you hope to
find out there in the desert.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.664
It looks like the limo
was headed toward Barstow.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.838
There's been noth’n but high winds and
sandstorms out here for the last week.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.699
You won't find anything.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.874
Let's kick in that matrix scanner.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.813
Coming on.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.707
Is that gonna work?

30:41.773 --> 30:46.051
Hey, if the space shuttle can spot 1,000-year-
old river beds using this technique,

30:46.144 --> 30:48.647
we ought to be able to… ah, bingo!

30:48.714 --> 30:50.660
There's a cluster of old miner's shacks.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.754
A mill settlement? The last miner
pulled outta there 30 years ago.

30:53.819 --> 30:57.528
You probably couldn't even find a
lizard mov’n down there right now.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.635
I've got an abandoned vehicle down there, Dom.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.071
Hey, it's an old Lasalle.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.439
My uncle had one just like that before the war.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.670
Which war?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.177
We're coming up on that DC-3.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.774
Boy, what a haul that would
make for an old desert rat.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.961
Huh, me and my big mouth. There it is.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.856
Hey, it's got the same license number.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.787
Yeah, but where's Roxanne?

32:01.019 --> 32:05.092
There's no tracks lead’n away from that limo.
They could be anywhere, in any direction.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.777
You want something to drink, honey?

32:15.567 --> 32:18.104
We're gonna be spend’n a lot of time together.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.147
Come on, honey.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.319
Hey, don't do that!

32:23.375 --> 32:26.015
We just want to party with the famous star.

32:27.446 --> 32:32.327
We even got one of your records
here. Let's give it a spin.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.290
See what it sounds like.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.613
Your biggest fan is here to see you.

33:10.188 --> 33:11.667
Give me a minute.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.741
My biggest fan.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.866
I am.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.946
I always have been.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.306
How many ways can I tell you, Roxy? I still…

33:27.372 --> 33:30.910
You still love me? You just had me kidnapped!

33:31.209 --> 33:34.656
Listen, damn it! For one time, just listen.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.956
We can go back.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.753
It's not too late.

33:40.919 --> 33:44.731
It can all be like it was
in those first years, Roxy.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.935
I still care about you.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.897
But I just want out.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.172
If you cared about me, you wouldn't
just leave me flat like this!

33:55.267 --> 33:57.645
Nick Desoto will never be flat.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.704
You'll rebound.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.217
You made me and you can do it again.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.618
With another Roxanne Marvel, a better one!

34:08.213 --> 34:09.886
I won't rebound, Rox.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.260
I'm broke.

34:24.563 --> 34:28.476
And I owe gambling debts.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.911
Maybe I can help you out.

34:30.969 --> 34:35.509
I don't want your damn charity! I
just want a share in what's mine!

34:35.574 --> 34:37.053
You do share, Nick!

34:37.108 --> 34:41.112
20% of everything goes to you. It's
not my fault if you gamble it away!

34:41.179 --> 34:44.717
20% of the old songs is 20% of nothing!

34:44.783 --> 34:46.126
They're hits!

34:46.184 --> 34:48.858
They're oldies. Oldies!

34:53.224 --> 34:55.864
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.338
I'll slit my wrists.

34:57.395 --> 35:02.310
I'll go off to country heaven with Elvis
and Hank and then your 20% will be gone!

35:02.367 --> 35:03.937
Shut up!

35:28.793 --> 35:30.363
Sal.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.234
Mickey!

35:36.368 --> 35:38.473
Get in here, you guys!

35:41.039 --> 35:42.416
Did you see her?

35:42.474 --> 35:45.182
What are you talking about? She was with you.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.813
She must have gone out back.

35:50.548 --> 35:52.926
I don't wanna see her again!

36:04.062 --> 36:07.305
I've picked up a mobile telephone on VHF.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.867
Dom, let's check it out.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.215
Rusty, I just said
goodbye to my ex-wife.

36:17.575 --> 36:18.952
We got a whole new plan.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.423
I got the firepower if those
Vegas creeps come around.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.893
Forget them. They're as good as paid off.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.232
It came in over a dirt road.

36:33.358 --> 36:37.067
Yeah but look, it breaks up
and goes all over the canyon.

36:37.128 --> 36:40.666
Well, the heat source from his car
engine says it was that one right there.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.084
We got gunfire bearing 085.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.090
Combat mode.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.693
Combat mode.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.684
He tried to kill me.

39:07.478 --> 39:10.755
He thought if I died, that my
recordings would become classics.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.593
You know, you've got a double back
at the concert. Dead ringer for ya.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.892
Yeah, I saw her.

39:19.157 --> 39:22.036
If you die in public, it would
be an even bigger splash.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.483
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.576
No one is allowed to use flash cameras,

39:36.641 --> 39:40.020
video recording devices or
any audio recording devices.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.554
The guys from Santini Air never showed.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.658
Just as well.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.091
We don't need any stray film of the accident.

39:52.156 --> 39:55.603
You fly the copter. I'll be there
with you. I'll run the cable.

39:55.660 --> 40:00.541
I only trusted myself with my ex-wife's safety

40:00.598 --> 40:02.509
and look what happened.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.069
Ha! Tragic.

40:07.038 --> 40:11.817
Oh! Honey, tonight you are the star.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.247
Well, I'll try to do my best.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.996
You can't just take over.
My boss leased that chopper.

40:26.057 --> 40:30.403
Yeah, and my boss is his boss so
pack it up and go home, lady.

40:30.461 --> 40:33.340
No way. It's a tricky stunt,
and I'm gonna do it.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.854
Don't go too far away.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.427
No, we'll be real close by.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.158
You call Security and you stay in your room.

41:31.456 --> 41:36.269
Hello Security, this is Roxanne Marvel, I…

41:37.929 --> 41:40.409
I need an escort to the concert.

41:44.235 --> 41:45.873
We're approaching the concert.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.581
Hey, but who's flying the UFO?

41:48.639 --> 41:49.640
It's gotta be Caitlin.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.847
Caitlin, this is Hawke. I'm about
a mile east of the concert area.

41:54.912 --> 41:57.688
You copy? Caitlin?

41:57.749 --> 42:00.059
Hey, that's Hawke and Santini.
They're nearby, man.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.496

42:36.387 --> 42:39.300
String, I've got Caitlin on a walkie-talkie.

Nick, it's not going to work.
Come on, let's get out of here!

44:22.693 --> 44:25.674
I'll drop this thing right in the
middle of a shopping center.

44:25.730 --> 44:28.006
That snake, he'd do it, too.

44:28.065 --> 44:31.842
Dom, we've gotta cut that saucer
loose. It's full of explosives.

44:31.903 --> 44:35.851
Hey, wait! If we do it now, we'll
take out a whole city block.

44:35.907 --> 44:38.183

44:41.812 --> 44:44.156
Hey, you told me to get
some heavy artillery, man.

44:45.883 --> 44:47.260
You're out of your mind?

44:47.318 --> 44:50.128
Hey, we're out of time.
Blow ‘em out of the sky.

45:04.101 --> 45:05.705
Hey, we gotta do someth’n.

45:05.770 --> 45:08.114
Every one of those rockets
is doing damage below.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.174
But there's no place to take ‘em out.

45:10.241 --> 45:12.983
It's all city as far as the eye can see.

45:13.778 --> 45:16.657
Wait! Straight ahead.

45:17.381 --> 45:18.883
There's a big city park.
