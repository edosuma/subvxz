00:06.300 --> 00:07.800
      Anybody seen my gum?      

00:07.800 --> 00:09.200
        Left it around          
          here somewhere.       

00:09.300 --> 00:10.800
                 What'd you take
            your gum out for?   

00:10.900 --> 00:13.800
    To give my mouth a rest,    
        you know.               

00:13.900 --> 00:18.300
Dear Diary, today               
it finally happened.            

00:20.600 --> 00:22.000
Wood, can I have another... Oh! 

00:22.100 --> 00:24.700
             Cliff,             

00:24.700 --> 00:28.200
                 I think I found
                    your gum.   

00:28.200 --> 00:30.700
This is a new jacket, too, man. 

00:30.800 --> 00:32.400
  Well, Norm, might I suggest   
        that you ice it         

00:32.500 --> 00:35.300
and then try to scrape the bulk 
 of it off with a razor blade,  

00:35.400 --> 00:37.100
    and maybe that way          
        you can save it.        

00:37.100 --> 00:38.500
 Oh, no, that's okay, Frasier.  

00:38.600 --> 00:40.500
    I was about to get          
      a new piece anyway.       

00:43.000 --> 00:45.600
Sounds like a lot of work,      
     Frasier, I don't know.     

00:45.700 --> 00:48.200
      Well, alternatively,      
  you could wait several years  

00:48.200 --> 00:49.500
 for the resins to break down,  

00:49.500 --> 00:51.900
    the gum to harden           
    and fall off by itself.     

00:59.500 --> 01:02.400
         I seem to have         
my full range of movement.      

01:02.500 --> 01:04.099
          I can wait.           

01:06.600 --> 01:09.900

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
             Whoo!              

02:19.100 --> 02:20.700
        Boy, did it just        
    get warm in here?           

02:20.700 --> 02:22.100
I hate Indian summers.          

02:22.100 --> 02:25.500
You never know what to wear     
to work in the morning.         

02:25.500 --> 02:28.100
  I mean, it's gonna get cold,  
      it should stay cold.      

02:29.500 --> 02:32.200
Then, who am I                  
to question the Lord?           

02:39.800 --> 02:41.000
                     What's with
                      the getup?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.600
    It's Indian summer, Sam.    

02:42.600 --> 02:45.300
      I need these clothes      
        for protection.         

02:45.400 --> 02:46.600
        Protection from what?   

02:46.600 --> 02:48.300
        The eyes of men.        

02:49.500 --> 02:51.100
                    What are you
                  talking about?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.400
Every time I've conceived a kid 
it's been during Indian Summer. 

02:54.500 --> 02:56.900
That's when I'm at my most      
        fertile, Sammy.         

02:56.900 --> 03:00.800
 I cannot let any man touch me, 
     talk to me or see me,      

03:00.800 --> 03:03.400
  or I'll be shooting out kids  
     like a Pez dispenser.      

03:06.800 --> 03:08.100
Oh, come on.                    

03:08.100 --> 03:09.800
                I'm not kidding,
                          Sammy.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.200
 I've-I've gone over two years  
now without having a kid.       

03:12.300 --> 03:14.000
  Now that's a record for me.   

03:14.100 --> 03:15.800
                  I'm not taking
                    any chances.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.600
          I was gonna stay home,
            turn off the lights,

03:18.600 --> 03:22.500
             lie down... but the
        cable man's coming over.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.800
Sweetheart, I promise you,      

03:24.900 --> 03:26.900
I won't let anybody             
put the moves on you, okay?     

03:27.000 --> 03:28.300
            Oh, no, you don't   
              understand, Sammy.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.500
                  It's not them,
                        it's me.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.700
    When the mercury hits 95,   

03:31.700 --> 03:34.300
          I can't be responsible
                 for my actions.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.300
    Oh.                         

03:35.400 --> 03:36.500
              Oh!               

03:36.600 --> 03:38.100
  Who is that hunk over there   

03:38.200 --> 03:40.400
         in the uniform         
      with the cute buns?       

03:41.900 --> 03:44.400
    Oh, my God, it's Clavin!    

03:47.200 --> 03:51.600
            Oh, this is, this is
        worse than I thought.   

03:51.600 --> 03:53.300
            Has he always had   
                  that mustache?

03:55.900 --> 03:57.600
                Iced coffee will
                cool me down.   

03:57.600 --> 03:59.300
                        REBECCA:
                  Hey, you guys,
                 listen to this.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.600
 "Rumor has it that the reason

     But so far our little caged

04:11.000 --> 04:14.300
 Boy, that writer really paints 
     a picture, doesn't he?     

04:14.300 --> 04:18.200
  You know, I can just picture  
     Mister Colcord sitting     

04:18.300 --> 04:20.200
 on his little perch in a cage, 

04:20.200 --> 04:23.200
      sharpening his beak       
    on a cuttlebone...          

04:23.300 --> 04:25.500
              Woody. Woody.     

04:25.600 --> 04:27.300
Pecking away                    
at a little bell                

04:27.400 --> 04:28.500
made out                        
of sesame seeds.                

04:28.600 --> 04:30.200
    Yeah!                       
                  Sam!          

04:30.200 --> 04:33.100
        Rebecca, this is kind   
         of a rip-off, isn't it?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.800
    I mean, they don't even     
    mention your name.          

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
And don't think                 
I'm not grateful.               

04:36.100 --> 04:36.800
    What do you mean?           

04:36.900 --> 04:38.100
  You could have been famous.   

04:38.300 --> 04:39.800
        Yeah, s-someday         
I would like to be famous,      

04:39.800 --> 04:41.800
  but not because I'm involved  
        with a rich man.        

04:41.900 --> 04:43.300
I mean, I would                 
like to be known                

04:43.300 --> 04:44.700
for some real                   
achievement.                    

04:44.700 --> 04:47.600
    Oh, yeah. How's that cure   
    for leprosy coming along?   

04:47.600 --> 04:49.300
     You know what I mean.      

04:49.400 --> 04:52.500
  You know how the girlfriends  
      of rich millionaires      

04:52.500 --> 04:55.800
are treated by the press;       
    like cheap sluts.           

04:55.800 --> 04:57.900
You know, I think it stems      
         from the envy          

04:58.000 --> 04:59.400
     that the public feels      
         towards people         

04:59.500 --> 05:01.700
  who achieve a certain level   
         of notoriety.          

05:01.700 --> 05:04.400
Well, also the fact that most of
  those women have posed nude   

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
  in popular men's magazines.   

05:06.200 --> 05:07.600
    But, you know, frankly,     

05:07.600 --> 05:09.800
I wouldn't waste my money       
on publications like that.      

05:09.900 --> 05:12.500
     I mean, those letters      
         are not real.          

05:14.700 --> 05:16.500
I just hope the rag             
magazines don't find out        

05:16.600 --> 05:18.800
that I am                       
the mystery woman.              

05:18.800 --> 05:20.500
Who am I kidding?               

05:20.600 --> 05:23.400
Those bloodhounds               
will ferret me out              

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
the first chance                
they get.                       

05:25.500 --> 05:28.200
But at least I have my dignity. 

05:28.300 --> 05:30.200
         Well, I'm off to change
                  the blue stuff

05:30.300 --> 05:31.500
      in the toilet bowls.      

05:33.400 --> 05:35.800
            (sighs)             

05:35.900 --> 05:37.700
        What's the matter, Wood?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.300
I don't get <i>The Far Side.</i>       

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
        Woody, come on.         
    Hand it over here.          

05:46.100 --> 05:47.300
            Come on.            
    Let's have a look.          

05:48.600 --> 05:53.000
Okay, Wood, now you see         
here in the first panel,        

05:53.100 --> 05:55.300
the cows are standing           
on their hind legs, right?      

05:56.700 --> 05:58.400
The second panel,               
when the car goes by,           

05:58.500 --> 06:00.700
they're acting like             
normal cows.                    

06:02.600 --> 06:06.400
          See, the idea here is,
    Wood, that, uh, you know,   

06:06.500 --> 06:09.300
         cows only act like cows
        when, when we're around.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.300
            Other times they act
                    like people.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.800
                  Now does that,
              does that help you

06:12.800 --> 06:14.400
                     clear it up
        a little bit for you?   

06:14.500 --> 06:16.800
          I just meant          
    I don't get <i>The Far Side</i>    

06:16.800 --> 06:18.200
    in my newspaper at home,    

06:18.200 --> 06:20.700
but thanks for treating me      
      like a one-year-old.      

06:29.100 --> 06:30.300
Oh, every time we turn on       

06:30.300 --> 06:32.100
 Robert Vaughn's                
 <i>Amazing Discoveries,</i>           

06:32.100 --> 06:34.200
we always get                   
the hair-loss episode.          

06:34.300 --> 06:36.100
I mean, it's like they,         
they never did any others.      

06:36.200 --> 06:38.600
     Well, listen, we don't have
        to watch an infomercial.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.300
                We can choose   
                  from any of 60

06:40.300 --> 06:42.400
                 wonderful cable
                  stations here.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.100
At the very least it's....      

06:44.200 --> 06:46.800
  Well, there's Lyle Waggoner   
    talking about impotence.    

06:46.800 --> 06:50.500
     Oh, people trying to whiten
             their yellow teeth.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.000
         <i>Singing in the Rain.</i>   

06:52.100 --> 06:54.200
      Oh, how to buy real estate
             with no money down.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.800
Wait, wait, wait,               
you just passed by              

06:55.900 --> 06:57.500
one of the all-time             
classics, Frasier.              

06:57.600 --> 07:01.000
Put it back on                  
the yellow teeth one.           

07:01.100 --> 07:02.400
                     Wait, wait,
                        go back.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.100
             There was a picture
            of Robin Colcord.   

07:04.200 --> 07:05.900
     Sources have confirmed     
          the identity          

07:06.000 --> 07:07.400
  of Colcord's mystery woman.   

07:07.400 --> 07:09.600
  Oh, God! They found me out!   

07:09.700 --> 07:11.300
     Colcord's secret lover     
        revealed herself        

07:11.400 --> 07:15.300
  in a press conference today   
  to be Jeanne Marie Beaulier,  

07:15.500 --> 07:17.100
    Charges d'Affaires          
for the French Consulate.       

07:17.100 --> 07:20.200
        Miss Beaulier...        
        Excuse me?              

07:20.200 --> 07:20.800
I thought Robin dumped          

07:21.000 --> 07:22.400
that French babe                
for you weeks ago.              

07:22.400 --> 07:24.300
                Well, he did!   

07:24.300 --> 07:26.300
            The nerve of that   
        cheap slut pretending   

07:26.300 --> 07:28.500
            like Robin turned   
             himself in for her!

07:28.500 --> 07:31.600
                    Don't worry,
                        Rebecca.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.900
        Your friends know who   
         the real cheap slut is.

07:37.100 --> 07:40.700
Thank you, Norm.                

07:40.800 --> 07:42.300
         Well, Rebecca,         
        don't be upset.         

07:42.400 --> 07:44.100
     I mean, she's actually     
    doing you a favor.          

07:44.100 --> 07:45.500
      You're off the hook.      

07:45.500 --> 07:47.000
The press is going              
to tear her apart               

07:47.100 --> 07:50.100
and leave your relationship     
with Robin unsullied.           

07:50.200 --> 07:51.900
        I guess you're right.   

07:52.000 --> 07:54.900
I mean, the only thing that     
really does matter is that,     

07:55.000 --> 07:56.800
that I am Robin's true love.    

07:56.800 --> 07:58.200
And it actually                 
makes it more romantic          

07:58.300 --> 08:00.200
because we're                   
the only ones who know.         

08:00.300 --> 08:01.500
            Yeah, except for us.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.300
And I kind of told my mom       
          in Hanover.           

08:05.400 --> 08:06.600
You know what I mean.           

08:06.600 --> 08:08.500
It's sort of like               
a secret valentine              

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
between me and Robin.           

08:09.600 --> 08:10.700
                    And us.     

08:10.700 --> 08:12.200
    And my mom.                 

08:12.300 --> 08:15.000
            Woody, who cares    
         if your mother knows?  

08:15.100 --> 08:17.100
          I mean, who is she    
            going to tell?      

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
Are you serious?                

08:18.300 --> 08:21.000
She has choir practice tonight. 

08:21.100 --> 08:22.200
Once she gets                   
a cup                           

08:22.300 --> 08:23.400
    of coffee in her,           

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
    those old biddies           
will bleed it out of her.       

08:25.600 --> 08:27.900
    For a moist crumb cake,     

08:27.900 --> 08:29.900
      she'll tell anybody       
    why you never see           

08:30.000 --> 08:32.799
Uncle Willie and Aunt May       
        in the same room        

08:32.900 --> 08:34.600
    at the same time.           

08:34.700 --> 08:38.900
              Why, uh, why would
                  that be, Wood?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.200
  I don't see any crumb cake.   

08:45.000 --> 08:48.600
        (phone ringing)         

08:48.700 --> 08:49.900
            Cheers.             

08:50.000 --> 08:52.100
          Oh, hi, Mom!          

08:52.200 --> 08:54.900
It's for me.                    

08:54.900 --> 08:57.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw the news, 

08:57.700 --> 08:59.600
  but don't believe everything  
         you see on TV.         

08:59.700 --> 09:04.000
That French lady, Jeanne Marie, 
was telling a big whopper.      

09:04.100 --> 09:07.100
    It was really Miss Howe     
    who was having...           

09:07.200 --> 09:10.900
        well, you know,         
      with Mister Colcord.      

09:11.000 --> 09:14.700
         Oh, all right.         
    I'm sorry. I will.          

09:18.000 --> 09:19.600
                    Where're you
                    going, Wood?

09:19.700 --> 09:23.100
    I have to go wash           
    my mouth out with soap.     

09:23.100 --> 09:25.900
          I'm sorry, Woody.     

09:25.900 --> 09:27.400
  Yeah, well, maybe next time   

09:27.400 --> 09:30.000
     you'll think about the     
 consequences of your actions.  

09:37.800 --> 09:40.500
        REPORTER:               
    Looks like no end           
 to the heat wave is in sight.  

09:40.600 --> 09:42.100
    Today may actually break    
        a hundred.              

09:42.200 --> 09:43.600
            Oh, man!            

09:43.700 --> 09:47.400
  I'd better get the crib out   
         of the garage.         

09:47.400 --> 09:49.900
         Hi, everybody.         
      I brought doughnuts.      

09:49.900 --> 09:51.600
                             Oh!

09:51.700 --> 09:53.200
     Gee, I haven't dunked      
      a doughnut in years.      

09:53.300 --> 09:54.800
  Wood, give me another beer,   
        will you?               

09:54.800 --> 09:57.400
          Oh, hey, did you see  
         the <i>Midnight Tattler?</i>  

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
                        What?   

09:58.500 --> 10:00.100
              Seems that, uh,   
                Jeanne Marie    

10:00.200 --> 10:01.800
        sold her love letters   
                from Robin.     

10:01.800 --> 10:03.500
                  Yeah? Whoo-ee!

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
                Look at the legs
                 on this chick!!

10:05.700 --> 10:07.300
Hey, hey, guys?                 
Guys, guys.                     

10:07.400 --> 10:09.200
Rebecca's standing              
right here.                     

10:09.200 --> 10:10.800
Try and to be                   
a little more polite.           

10:10.800 --> 10:12.600
              Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
             Thank you very much

10:12.700 --> 10:13.900
              for the doughnuts,
                        Rebecca.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.800
                Look at the legs
                on this babe!   

10:15.800 --> 10:18.100
        Are they continued on   
         the next page or what?!

10:18.200 --> 10:19.700
Don't bother, Sam.              
I've seen the article.          

10:19.800 --> 10:22.100
It's just a stupid,             
pitiable act                    

10:22.200 --> 10:23.500
of a desperate woman.           

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
Those letters                   
are not real.                   

10:25.600 --> 10:27.900
        They never are.         

10:31.100 --> 10:33.900
Robin did not type              
those letters.                  

10:33.900 --> 10:34.900
I have seen his typewriter.     

10:35.000 --> 10:37.400
He doesn't even use             
that font.                      

10:37.500 --> 10:39.400
        (phone ringing)         

10:39.500 --> 10:41.400
                  Cheers.       

10:41.500 --> 10:43.900
            Oh, hi, Mom.        

10:44.000 --> 10:45.100
              It's for me.      

10:46.900 --> 10:49.700
            Um, yeah, yeah,     
          I-I saw the article.  

10:49.800 --> 10:52.900
             Miss Howe says     
        it's not even his font. 

10:53.000 --> 10:54.400
                 What?          

10:54.500 --> 10:59.000
            No, Mom, font       
          isn't a bad word.     

10:59.000 --> 11:00.400
            No, it's not...     

11:00.400 --> 11:02.500
            All right. Okay.    

11:11.500 --> 11:13.800
    Thanks a lot, Miss Howe.    

11:13.800 --> 11:17.600
CLIFF:                          
Hey, Sammy, how about           
turning up the sound?           

11:17.600 --> 11:18.800
         Don't you care         
    about any of this?          

11:18.900 --> 11:20.300
     I mean, it's got to be     
  bothering you a little bit.   

11:20.400 --> 11:21.500
I wouldn't be human             

11:21.600 --> 11:23.400
if it didn't bother me          
a little bit.                   

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
But, I mean, what does          
it really amount to?            

11:25.500 --> 11:26.700
I have Robin's love             

11:26.700 --> 11:29.100
and she has a couple of blurbs  
in a cheap tabloid.             

11:29.200 --> 11:31.100
And it's not like she's some    
national celebrity.             

11:31.100 --> 11:33.200
         ARSENIO HALL:          
  Join me tonight as the stage  
     sizzles with my guests     

11:33.300 --> 11:34.400
Michael Caine, M.C. Hammer      

11:34.500 --> 11:36.400
  and the woman Robin Colcord   
        gave it up for,         

11:36.500 --> 11:40.100
  and I mean really gave it up  
  for, Jeanne Marie Beaulieu.   

11:40.200 --> 11:42.900
    Watch her kick it           
 on the next <i>Arsenio Hall Show.</i> 

11:43.000 --> 11:45.300
              Hey!              

11:45.400 --> 11:47.700
I'm the one who should be       
          kickin' it!           

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
    Hey.                        

12:00.600 --> 12:02.700
This is getting                 
very serious.                   

12:02.800 --> 12:04.800
Thank you for your concern, Sam.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.000
 Do you have any idea how much  
         that TV costs?         

12:07.100 --> 12:08.300
                    What?       

12:08.400 --> 12:10.300
 The corporation owns this bar  
        for three years,        

12:10.300 --> 12:11.400
you don't break anything.       

12:11.500 --> 12:13.000
I have it for three weeks,      

12:13.100 --> 12:14.800
     you yank my television     
         off the wall.          

12:14.900 --> 12:17.000
        I'm sorry.              
  I shouldn't have done that.   

12:17.100 --> 12:18.200
                  It's just that
                 I didn't expect

12:18.200 --> 12:20.500
          this thing with Jeanne
        Marie to go this far.   

12:20.600 --> 12:23.000
             Before, nobody even
              took it seriously.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.400
    And all of a sudden she's   
     getting national attention.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
             Tonight she's going
            to be on <i>Arsenio.</i>   

12:27.600 --> 12:30.400
Yeah, I know.                   
And thanks to you,              
I can't watch it.               

12:30.400 --> 12:33.700
  Why hasn't Robin spoken out?  

12:33.800 --> 12:35.500
I mean, why hasn't              
he denied this?                 

12:35.600 --> 12:38.900
What if... what if he really    
does love Jeanne Marie?         

12:38.900 --> 12:40.000
What would I do?                

12:40.100 --> 12:41.800
                    Hey. I know.
    What?                       

12:41.800 --> 12:44.300
            I'll get my landlady
                to tape <i>Arsenio.</i>

12:44.400 --> 12:46.900
No, Sam.                        
    No, no, no, you're right,   
     you're right, you're right.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.100
          Then I'd be obligated.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.000
    Sam!                        

12:50.000 --> 12:51.300
You're not listening to me.     

12:51.400 --> 12:52.600
                Well, all right,
            I'm listening. What?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.300
  I mean I cannot just ask him  
    if he loves Jeanne Marie    

12:54.300 --> 12:55.900
because then he will think      
    that I don't trust him.     

12:56.000 --> 12:56.900
                     You don't. 

12:57.000 --> 12:58.400
I know, but I should.           

12:58.500 --> 13:00.400
    But if I ask him,           
  "Do you love Jeanne Marie?"   

13:00.500 --> 13:02.900
and he says "Yes," I don't think
that I could handle that.       

13:03.000 --> 13:05.600
And if I ask him if he loved me 
    and he said "Yes,"          

13:05.600 --> 13:07.700
    then he would know          
that I did not trust him.       

13:07.700 --> 13:10.100
  And trusting him is the one   
 thing that I really should do  

13:10.200 --> 13:11.800
        since he gave up        
     his fortune for me...      

13:11.800 --> 13:13.600
        if he really did        
    give it up for me,          

13:13.700 --> 13:16.300
     which I can never know     
      because I can't ask.      

13:17.900 --> 13:21.300
             Let me see if I can
    put this in a nutshell...   

13:21.300 --> 13:24.600
                What?           

13:24.700 --> 13:28.200
 Sam, would you ask him for me? 

13:28.300 --> 13:30.100
         No. No, no. No, I don't
                want to do that.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.300
I've never been to prison.      

13:31.300 --> 13:32.800
              Oh, well, it's not
        really a real prison.   

13:32.900 --> 13:34.000
          I...                  
                  No it's like a

13:34.000 --> 13:35.100
          minimum-security deal.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.400
          It's like summer camp,

13:36.500 --> 13:40.800
         only Robin has to spend
     seven to ten summers there.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.700
    No, really, and when you,   
            when you see him,   

13:45.800 --> 13:47.800
             don't tell him that
        I told you to ask, okay?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.600
            I mean, just make it
        sound like, you know,   

13:49.700 --> 13:51.100
             you just dropped by
            prison, you know,   

13:51.100 --> 13:53.800
        it's just like a real   
            casual deal for you.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.500
            Uh, no.             
    No, Rebecca, I'm sorry.     

13:56.600 --> 13:59.300
                    Okay.       

13:59.300 --> 14:01.900
                      Forget it.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.300
        It's just that, um...   

14:05.300 --> 14:07.100
                whenever I think

14:07.200 --> 14:10.300
        that Robin might love   
         Jeanne Marie, you know,

14:10.400 --> 14:14.400
I just get so darned mad,       
        you know?               

14:14.400 --> 14:17.700
 Just feel like I could just... 

14:25.800 --> 14:27.500
  Okay. Okay.                   

14:27.600 --> 14:31.500
I guess I can...                
swing by the prison,            

14:31.500 --> 14:34.800
on my way to the billiards      
         supply store.          

14:37.000 --> 14:39.400
        Carla, uh, watch the bar
            for me, will you?   

14:39.500 --> 14:41.700
             I've got to go down
         to prison for a minute.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.300
                         Prison?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.500
      Isn't that where they keep
        all the bad, lonely men?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.400
Now, come on, Carla.            
Don't.                          

14:48.500 --> 14:51.400
    Oh, Sammy, take me          
    with you, please?           
                             No.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.600
Smuggle me in                   
in your pants.                  
                     No!        

14:53.700 --> 14:56.500
            Please?             
     I need a tattooed man!     

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
         Please, Sammy.         

14:57.600 --> 14:58.900
Carla, no!                      

15:15.900 --> 15:17.200
          Ah, yeah, there he is.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.200
             Thanks very much.  

15:18.300 --> 15:19.400
          Hey, Robin.           

15:19.500 --> 15:21.200
Robin. Hey.                     

15:21.300 --> 15:22.400
        Hey, Sam.               

15:22.500 --> 15:23.600
    What are you doing here?    

15:23.700 --> 15:25.500
             I, uh,             

15:25.600 --> 15:27.400
     I need to talk to you      
         for a minute.          

15:27.500 --> 15:28.900
      Oh, yeah, certainly.      

15:28.900 --> 15:30.300
         Grab a racket.         

15:30.300 --> 15:32.100
Oh, well, all right.            

15:35.400 --> 15:36.700
Yes, I'd stop to talk, only...  

15:36.800 --> 15:38.900
I just get three hours          
a week on the court.            

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
    Prison, you know.           

15:47.800 --> 15:49.000
Excuse me, Sam,                 

15:49.100 --> 15:50.500
          weren't you           
    a professional athlete?     

15:50.600 --> 15:52.900
  Well, yeah, I was a pitcher   
    for the American League,    

15:52.900 --> 15:56.800
      but I never actually      
      had to hit anything.      

15:56.900 --> 16:00.100
I see, so basically you just did
  what this machine is doing.   

16:00.100 --> 16:01.800
  Yeah, but my arm got tired.   

16:01.800 --> 16:03.900
     So, Sam, what have you     
    got on your mind?           

16:04.000 --> 16:06.600
     I want to talk to you      
about your ex-girlfriend.       

16:06.600 --> 16:09.600
 Can you be, uh, more specific? 

16:09.800 --> 16:12.700
The one you were running around 
  with behind Rebecca's back.   

16:14.900 --> 16:16.300
Can you be more specific?       

16:16.400 --> 16:17.600
         Jeanne Marie.          

16:17.700 --> 16:18.500
              Oh!               

16:18.700 --> 16:20.000
     Oh, dear Jeanne Marie.     

16:20.100 --> 16:22.700
 Yes, I do hope her little game 
         with the press         

16:22.700 --> 16:23.900
    isn't troubling Rebecca.    

16:24.000 --> 16:24.900
            Yeah, well...       

16:25.900 --> 16:28.200
        Yeah, it is actually.   

16:28.300 --> 16:30.700
              You know this girl
            is running around   

16:30.800 --> 16:32.300
            getting exploited   
             all over the place,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.200
                 but we all know
            that it's Rebecca   

16:34.300 --> 16:35.800
                that deserves   
                to be exploited.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.700
  Hey, these things are coming  
          pretty fast.          

16:38.800 --> 16:40.200
          Can we slow them down?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.600
Oh no, if they went any slower  
they wouldn't remain airborne.  

16:44.200 --> 16:45.300
Yeah, yeah, Sam, look,          

16:45.400 --> 16:47.100
if Rebecca is really            
getting troubled by this,       

16:47.100 --> 16:49.000
why didn't she make             
mention of it to me?            

16:49.100 --> 16:51.300
             Well, I don't know,
                    actually.   

16:51.400 --> 16:54.800
    She, uh, tried to explain   
        that to me, but I, uh...

16:54.900 --> 16:57.100
Yes, enough said.               

16:57.200 --> 16:58.200
    Poor Rebecca.               

17:00.100 --> 17:03.100
Her insecurities have finally   
got the better of her.          

17:03.200 --> 17:04.500
Well, perhaps I should, uh,     

17:04.500 --> 17:06.599
make an end of Jeanne           
Marie's little charade          

17:06.599 --> 17:10.300
and go to the press             
and tell them the truth.        

17:10.400 --> 17:11.500
          Do you think          
      that would help her?      

17:11.599 --> 17:13.300
                     Sure, yeah.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.700
     Say, is your arm sore?     

17:14.700 --> 17:16.400
What?                           
                  My arm's sore.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.900
                  Right here.   
Oh, yes.                        

17:18.000 --> 17:19.599
Well, we can take               
a break if you like.            

17:19.700 --> 17:21.400
                      All right.
    Maurice!                    

17:21.500 --> 17:23.099
                Thanks, Maurice.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.200
                    Whoo!       

17:29.200 --> 17:30.300
Hey, Robin.                     

17:30.400 --> 17:32.200
Excuse me, are you through      
with the court yet?             

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
              Yes, Sherman.     
             It's all yours.    

17:33.300 --> 17:34.400
    Thanks.                     

17:34.500 --> 17:35.800
                 Maurice!       

17:35.800 --> 17:38.200
      Hey, I voted for that guy.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.800
          Okay, guys, we got it.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.600
You know, I think               
Rebecca did us a favor          

17:51.700 --> 17:52.900
by breaking that old TV.        

17:53.000 --> 17:54.200
                    Yeah, I like
                     this new TV

17:54.200 --> 17:55.700
                    a lot better
            than the old one.   

17:55.800 --> 17:56.900
We're not talking TV here.      

17:56.900 --> 17:58.400
    This is the latest          
      in video technology.      

17:58.500 --> 18:01.600
     We've got Dolby sound,     
 black matrix, high resolution. 

18:01.700 --> 18:03.200
     I mean, look at that.      

18:03.200 --> 18:06.000
 It's almost as if Deputy Dog's 
right in the room with us.      

18:06.100 --> 18:07.500
        Yeah.                   
                         Yeah.  

18:11.600 --> 18:13.000
            My God.             

18:13.100 --> 18:16.500
It's another scorcher out there.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.000
      I am sick and tired       

18:18.000 --> 18:21.800
      of peeling patients       
    off of my leather couch.    

18:21.800 --> 18:23.700
         I'll tell you,         
    the ones in shorts          

18:23.800 --> 18:27.700
scream like banshees            
when I get them up fast.        

18:27.700 --> 18:30.200
    Well, fortunately,          
I'm a trained psychiatrist      

18:30.300 --> 18:33.900
  and I've learned to tune out  
        cries for help.         

18:37.300 --> 18:39.100
      Say, where's Carla?       

18:39.100 --> 18:40.800
    She asked us to lock her    
         in the office          

18:40.900 --> 18:42.400
  until the heat wave breaks.   

18:42.500 --> 18:44.100
      For goodness sakes.       

18:44.200 --> 18:45.800
    I mean this has gone on     
          long enough.          

18:45.900 --> 18:48.500
 The human female doesn't have  
    an estrous cycle.           

18:48.600 --> 18:50.600
 Someone is gonna have to tell  
      her that the weather      

18:50.700 --> 18:52.500
cannot affect human beings      
        this way.               

18:52.600 --> 18:54.800
    Carla! May I have a word    
    with you, please?           

18:56.500 --> 18:57.600
              Oh!               

19:05.900 --> 19:07.300
    How is she, Fras?           

19:07.300 --> 19:10.400
        Be afraid.              

19:10.500 --> 19:14.200
        Be very afraid.         

19:14.300 --> 19:17.100
Has anyone seen                 
an afternoon paper?             

19:17.200 --> 19:18.900
                Uh, what are you
                    looking for?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.600
Well, because                   
Robin's statement               

19:20.700 --> 19:22.400
         about me being his true
                love is supposed

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
to be in the late edition.      

19:23.400 --> 19:25.100
I sent Woody out                
for it hours ago.               

19:25.200 --> 19:26.600
 You, you sent Woody out there? 

19:26.600 --> 19:28.200
    It's a hundred degrees.     

19:33.700 --> 19:35.300
     I'm sorry, Miss Howe.      

19:35.300 --> 19:36.500
 I would have been here sooner, 

19:36.600 --> 19:39.400
but I think I passed out between
    the newsstand and here.     

19:41.100 --> 19:42.800
Woody, man,                     
are you all right?              

19:42.900 --> 19:45.600
            Yes, he's all right.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.100
I bet I'm on the cover.         

19:47.100 --> 19:48.800
                      Heat wave,
                    heat wave...

19:48.900 --> 19:50.300
                      heat wave.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.600
         children in sprinklers,
            heat wave...        

19:52.600 --> 19:54.400
So it's a little warm out.      

19:54.400 --> 19:56.600
                  Grandma?      

19:58.600 --> 20:00.400
        Is that you, Grandma?   

20:02.200 --> 20:05.100
             Thank you, Grandma.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.300
                 Here it is.    

20:07.300 --> 20:09.100
"Millionaire Robin Colcord says 

20:09.100 --> 20:11.900
     that his true love         
is some Boston bar manager."    

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
         What?                  

20:13.000 --> 20:14.200
        That's it?!             

20:14.300 --> 20:17.100
  I thought I was gonna         
    be big news.                

20:17.200 --> 20:19.600
     Such is the transitory     
        nature of fame.         

20:19.600 --> 20:21.700
        You have missed         
    your moment in the sun.     

20:21.700 --> 20:24.500
 I had three hours in the sun.  

20:24.600 --> 20:26.300
Would somebody shut him up?     

20:27.500 --> 20:30.600
        This just isn't fair.   

20:30.600 --> 20:32.400
    Robin gave it up for me.    

20:32.400 --> 20:34.100
     Me, not Jeanne Marie.      

20:34.200 --> 20:35.400
Well, hey,                      

20:35.400 --> 20:37.200
             I wouldn't worry so
        much about Jeanne Marie.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.900
                    She's washed
                        up, too.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.500
         Look where they put her
        on <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>   

20:40.600 --> 20:42.500
                  Center bottom.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.300
                  Nobody's gonna
              call on her there.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.200
             She might as well  
                be a Gabor.     

20:48.300 --> 20:50.600
              MAN:              
I'll take Robin Colcord's       
        lover to block.         

20:52.000 --> 20:52.900
             No, no, whoa, whoa!

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
                  Come on, guys,
             switch the channel.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.300
  Put a game on or something.   

20:55.300 --> 20:56.400
I'm trying, Sammy.              

20:56.500 --> 20:57.900
How do you work                 
this damned remote?             

20:57.900 --> 21:00.000
         Oh, wait, you need this
        one to work that one.   

21:04.100 --> 21:05.300
      Damn!                     
                Relax. Relax.   

21:05.400 --> 21:07.300
No, it was my turn, Sam!        

21:07.300 --> 21:09.000
Everybody in the world was      
    supposed to know that...    

21:09.000 --> 21:11.400
    that I was Robin's          
         mystery femme.         

21:11.500 --> 21:13.900
  I was supposed to be famous.  

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
            You know, that's not
        what you said before.   

21:15.100 --> 21:16.100
         You said the only thing
                that mattered   

21:16.200 --> 21:17.200
    was that Robin loves you.   

21:17.300 --> 21:18.800
Yeah, yeah, well...             

21:18.800 --> 21:20.700
that was back when              
I thought Jeanne Marie          

21:20.700 --> 21:22.200
was gonna be laughed at.        

21:22.300 --> 21:24.300
But now, I didn't know          
that she was gonna become       

21:24.400 --> 21:26.000
America's little sweetheart     
and I was gonna become          

21:26.100 --> 21:29.900
America's little                
stupid idiot nobody.            

21:29.900 --> 21:31.900
         Honey, listen, from the
      outside, fame looks great.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.100
        But when you actually   
              have it, it's not,

21:34.100 --> 21:36.000
            it's not all that   
          it's cracked up to be.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.300
    Oh, how would you know?     

21:37.300 --> 21:40.500
Well, I had a little bit        
of fame, once upon a time.      

21:40.600 --> 21:43.300
  Oh, yeah, right, that time you
almost got hit by that truck.   

21:43.400 --> 21:44.600
        No.                     

21:44.700 --> 21:46.900
No, no, no, come on.            

21:47.000 --> 21:48.500
When I was pitching             
for the Sox.                    

21:48.600 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, sure,                     

21:50.100 --> 21:51.400
      fame has its perks.       

21:51.500 --> 21:53.800
I mean, you don't have to stand 
    in line at restaurants.     

21:53.800 --> 21:54.900
    That's very nice.           

21:55.000 --> 21:58.300
And cops let you slide          
on a few traffic tickets.       

21:58.300 --> 22:00.400
  That's... that's very nice.   

22:00.500 --> 22:02.700
Autographs, I mean, that's cool 
        and all of that.        

22:02.800 --> 22:04.100
        But, basically,         
      it's just a hassle.       

22:04.200 --> 22:05.400
            Really?             

22:05.500 --> 22:06.100
          Yeah, sure.           

22:06.300 --> 22:08.400
        Not being famous        
      is ten times better.      

22:08.500 --> 22:09.600
            Really?             
Yeah.                           

22:09.700 --> 22:11.600
Yeah, you get treated           
just like everybody else.       

22:11.700 --> 22:13.700
You can go to the               
supermarket in peace.           

22:13.800 --> 22:16.400
Nobody crowds around you.       

22:16.500 --> 22:17.800
As a matter of fact,            

22:17.800 --> 22:20.300
they don't pay any              
attention to you at all.        

22:20.400 --> 22:23.200
No, they certainly don't        
let you cut ahead of them       

22:23.200 --> 22:24.800
in the ten-items-or-less line.  

22:24.900 --> 22:26.900
    No, no, no, no, no, no.     

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
    You have to wait behind     
      all the old ladies.       

22:29.000 --> 22:31.500
    Some of them have           
     way beyond ten items.      

22:31.500 --> 22:33.200
'Cause believe me, you've got   
all the time in the world       

22:33.300 --> 22:36.000
to count every little can,      
  every little loaf of bread.   

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
             Sam...             

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
By the time you get to the front
          of the line,          

22:39.100 --> 22:41.000
     they're only too happy     
  to cut up your credit cards   

22:41.100 --> 22:42.800
  right in front of your face   
    because you're nothing!     

22:42.900 --> 22:43.900
                          Sam...

22:43.900 --> 22:46.600
         Sam, are you all right?

22:46.700 --> 22:49.900
I miss it so much, Rebecca.     

22:50.000 --> 22:51.500
        Oh...                   

22:51.600 --> 22:52.700
                  I know you do.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.900
        But we're both better   
            off without it, Sam.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.100
Do you remember, remember       
all the attention I got         

22:57.200 --> 23:00.100
when that truck almost hit me?  

23:02.900 --> 23:04.700
     Well, there's no break     
    in this heat wave.          

23:04.800 --> 23:07.900
 As a matter of fact, tomorrow  
  is going to be even hotter.   

23:07.900 --> 23:09.400
         Let's look now         
      at the satellite...       

23:09.400 --> 23:10.600
        (rumbling)              

23:10.700 --> 23:12.400
          Oh, my God!           

23:12.400 --> 23:13.600
     Clear out, everybody!      

23:13.600 --> 23:14.900
    She's gonna blow!           

23:18.200 --> 23:19.700
        (rumbling)
