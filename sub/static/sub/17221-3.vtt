AND THEN I CHOKED HIM,
AND THEN HE PASSED OUT,

01:43.904 --> 01:46.174

THAT'S WHERE WE LEFT IT.

UH, THANK YOU
FOR THE INVITATION, BUT, NO.

IT WOULD'VE HURT HIS FEELINGS.

UNETHICAL, AND YOU KNOW IT, TOM.

A VERY DETAILED DIARY.

RESPONDED TO HER SUMMONS.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.257
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU NEED THAT TESTIMONY.

- I KNOW, BUT I THINK THE OWNER,
CHAD FORBES,

03:11.292 --> 03:12.593
IS PAYING HER NOT TO TALK.

08:26.607 --> 08:30.243
YOUR HONOR, I PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.145
THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.114
- AND THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING

08:34.147 --> 08:37.017
THAT YOU WERE,
IN FACT, INDULGED...

08:37.050 --> 08:38.986
MIGHTILY.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.054
COUNSELOR, YOUR FIRST WITNESS.

08:41.088 --> 08:45.092
- YOUR HONOR, THE STATE
WOULD LIKE TO CALL HANNAH JAM...

08:45.125 --> 08:46.293
REAL NAME.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.196
TAKE YOUR TIME.
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.298
- NO, I JUST HAD SOMETHING
IN MY EYE.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.567
- NO, IT'S--
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

08:53.601 --> 08:57.037
MISS JAM, IN YOUR TIME WORKING
AS A KNOCKERS GIRL,

08:57.070 --> 09:00.007
DID YOU EXPERIENCE
UNWANTED ADVANCES?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.074
- WELL, SURE.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.876
WHEN CUSTOMERS ORDERED
THE "SLAP MY BUNS" BURGER,

09:02.910 --> 09:05.746
THEY TYPICALLY EXPECTED
TO SLAP MY BUNS.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.281
- BUT WOULD YOU
CHARACTERIZE BJ KNOCKERS

09:08.315 --> 09:10.984
AS A HOSTILE WORKING
ENVIRONMENT?

09:11.018 --> 09:12.886
- OBJECTION.
- APPROACH.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.822
- YOUR HONOR, IT'S POLICY
AT BJ KNOCKERS

09:14.855 --> 09:16.924
TO HAVE ALL THEIR SERVERS
SIGN CONSENT FORMS.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.091
SHE WAS FULLY AWARE
SHE'D BE WORKING

09:18.125 --> 09:19.693
IN A SEXUALLY CHARGED
ENVIRONMENT.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.830
- THE COURT ACKNOWLEDGES
EXHIBIT "A," JUDY.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.031
- [squeals softly]

09:24.064 --> 09:26.099
- CAN YOU TELL THE COURT
WHAT THIS IS?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.802
- IT'S MY CONSENT FORM
TO BE A KNOCKERS GIRL.

09:28.836 --> 09:29.903
WE ALL HAD TO SIGN IT.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.907
- MISS JAM, TO WHAT WERE YOU
CONSENTING IN THIS FORM?

09:33.941 --> 09:36.243
- I GUESS THAT I KNEW
WHAT I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.811
- AH.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.312
- ALL RIGHT, THE JURY
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

09:39.346 --> 09:40.814
THAT IS MISS JAM'S SIGNATURE...

09:40.848 --> 09:42.115
- I'D REALLY PREFER "HANNAH."

09:42.149 --> 09:43.951
- ON THE CONSENT FORM,

09:43.984 --> 09:45.986
BUT I'M SORRY, DEFENSE.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.656
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ACTUAL LAW.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.391
SO LET IT BE KNOWN
THAT AT ALL TIMES,

09:51.424 --> 09:54.294
MISS JAM DID RETAIN
HER LEGAL RIGHT

09:54.327 --> 09:56.930
TO NOT GET HER BUTT SLAPPED.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.231
GOT IT?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.833
RECESS, ONE HOUR.

10:05.773 --> 10:05.973
.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.074
- DID YOU LOSE SOMETHING?
- YEAH, MY DANISH EYE MASK.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.645
IT REDUCES THE APPEARANCE
OF FINE LINES AND WRINKLES

10:11.679 --> 10:12.412
WHILST I NAP.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.214
- PERHAPS YOUR NAP COULD WAIT.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.415
- NO, SIR, IT'S A $100 MASK,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.250
AND IT MAKES ME LOOK
A MONTH YOUNGER.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.120
- THERE IS
A LIFE-SIZE FIREFIGHTER

10:20.153 --> 10:22.122
CALLING YOUR NAME OUT
ON THE STEPS OF THE COURTHOUSE.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.423
WOULD YOU PLEASE ADDRESS IT?
- I KNOW.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.125
SIR, CAN'T YOU ASK SECURITY
TO DO IT?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.126
I MEAN, ALL THEY'RE DOING

10:26.159 --> 10:27.795
IS SITTING AROUND
PLAYING CANDY CRUSH

10:27.828 --> 10:30.297
AND SWAPPING LINKS TO PORN SITES
ON THEIR PHONES.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.165
- HEY, TIGER EYES--
THAT IS VERY NICE.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.834
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
LOWER YOUR CHAKRAS?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.670
HEY, JUDGE.
NO? NOTHING?

10:36.704 --> 10:38.305
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SAME AS YOU.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.740
NOTHING--YOU GET NOTHING
OUT OF THAT GUY.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.441
SILENCE IS GOLDEN.
HE IS GOOD AT THAT.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.443
BY THE WAY,
THERE'S A FIREFIGHTER

10:43.476 --> 10:45.145
ROAMING THE HALLS
LOOKING FOR YOU,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.446
LOOKING LIKE HE JUST FELL
OUT OF A CALENDAR,

10:46.479 --> 10:49.316
SO YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY HANDLE THAT.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.218
- REBECCA?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.720
REBECCA?

10:52.753 --> 10:56.289
[elevator music]

10:56.323 --> 10:58.425
- [clears throat]

10:58.458 --> 11:01.695
*

11:01.729 --> 11:04.965
[elevator bell dings]

11:04.998 --> 11:06.466
- REBECCA?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.837
REBECCA?

11:09.870 --> 11:10.971
- REBECCA!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.405
[elevator bell dings]

11:12.439 --> 11:13.406
- REBECCA, HOLD UP!

11:13.440 --> 11:16.243
- [grunting]

11:16.276 --> 11:18.812
*

11:18.846 --> 11:22.816
- DID I INVITE YOU
TO THE FIREMAN'S BALL?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
- OH, UM, I COULD STAND
IN THE CORNER

11:24.517 --> 11:26.386
AND SING A DRAKE SONG TO MYSELF,
IF YOU GUYS WANT--

11:26.419 --> 11:28.722
- NO, NO, NO. NO. THIS ISN'T
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.490
HE JUST WONDERED IF HE ASKED ME
TO THE FIREMAN'S BALL.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.292
YOU DID.
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.160
- YEAH.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.128
BUT THEN WHEN I WOKE UP,
YOU WERE GONE,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.197
AND I'M TRYING, BUT I CAN'T
REMEMBER YOUR ANSWER.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.300
- YEAH, I--WELL, I DIDN'T SAY,
BECAUSE, UM--

11:40.333 --> 11:43.070
WELL, I WAS WAITING--
TEDWARD HAS MY CALENDAR, SO...

11:43.103 --> 11:44.805
- OH, COOL.
I'LL FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR OFFICE.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.807
- UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M GOING CAR SHOPPING NOW.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.809
- WELL, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT CARS.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.078
- YEAH, ME TOO.
I REPLACE MY SPARK PLUGS.

11:51.111 --> 11:54.181
- I REBUILT MY TRANSMISSION.
- YEAH? I REBUILT MY ENGINE.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.149
- I LIFTED A CABRIOLET
OFF A FAMILY OF FIVE

11:56.183 --> 11:58.318
WHILE IT WAS ON FIRE.
- WOW.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.820
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT WILL HELP ME.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.156
BUT, YEAH, OKAY, COME WITH.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:03.190 --> 12:07.094
- ALL RIGHT, JUDGE, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU LIKE ANYTHING.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.428
- OKAY, THANKS, LENNY.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.429
- I'LL SET IT ASIDE FOR YOU
BEFORE THE AUCTION.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.364
- HEY, SAY "HEY"
TO YOUR WIFE FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.166
- SHE LEFT ME LAST MONTH
FOR ANOTHER GUY.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.034
- SLUT!

12:14.067 --> 12:15.535
- SHE'S STILL THE MOTHER
OF MY CHILDREN.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.805
- SLUT...
AND AN ANGEL.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.440
- [laughs] NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.110
- HEY, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.012
- OKAY, WILL DO.
THANKS, LENNY.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.113
- REBECCA?
- HMM?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.081
- YOU SURE THIS IS WHERE YOU
WANT TO SHOP FOR A CAR?

12:28.115 --> 12:30.217
- OH, COME ON, THIS IS THE
PERFECT PLACE TO SHOP FOR A CAR.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.451
THEY'RE BASICALLY ALL ON SALE.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.387
- YEAH, BECAUSE THEY WERE OWNED
BY KILLERS AND DRUG DEALERS.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
- DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE CAR
OF A DRUG DEALER?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.125
YOU KNOW, CROOKS
DON'T DRIVE WAGONS, OKAY?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.993
OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S A HUMAN FOOT.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.561
- WHAT?
- GOTCHA!

12:41.594 --> 12:45.298
[laughing] COME ON, I'M JOKING!
LIGHTEN UP!

12:45.332 --> 12:47.334
THESE ARE LIKE
NORMAL-PEOPLE CARS, THOUGH--

12:47.367 --> 12:49.202
MOST OF THEM ANYWAY, YOU KNOW?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.839
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS THING.
ACTUALLY, THIS TRUCK IS--

12:51.872 --> 12:53.140
THIS IS IN REALLY NICE SHAPE,

12:53.173 --> 12:57.510
PROBABLY SOME OLD RETIRED GUY
KEEPING IT UP.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.180
- YEAH, CHECK OUT
THE LICENSE PLATE.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.150
- "COKE KING."

13:03.183 --> 13:05.318
IT'S A LITTLE ON THE NOSE.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.488
GET IT? "ON THE NOSE."
- NO.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.325
YOU KNOW, REBECCA,
I, UM...

13:12.359 --> 13:14.494
I PICK UP ON THINGS.
- YOU DO?

13:14.527 --> 13:17.497
- YEAH. AND YOU MAY CALL ME
CRAZY, BUT...

13:17.530 --> 13:19.166
I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
AVOIDING ME ALL WEEK.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.400
- NO.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.336
- I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW...

13:23.370 --> 13:25.338
I GET IT.
- YOU DO?

13:25.372 --> 13:28.341
GOING OUT IN PUBLIC TOGETHER--
IT'S A BIG STEP.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.544
THESE LEGS--
THEY'RE LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE IT.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.847
SEE?
SEE HOW LONG THEY ARE?

13:33.881 --> 13:35.082
HUH?
[chuckles]

13:35.115 --> 13:37.117
- UH-HUH.
[engine turning over]

13:40.020 --> 13:41.989
REBECCA?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.324
REBECCA?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.295
- HANNAH, DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.163
- YEAH.
THAT'S MY ROOMMATE'S DIARY.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.999
- AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR ROOMMATE WROTE ABOUT

13:52.032 --> 13:53.633
IN THIS DIARY?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.336
- WELL, WE WERE TAKING
A LOT OF CRAP AT KNOCKERS,

13:56.369 --> 13:59.339
AND SHE DECIDED TO DOCUMENT
ALL THE STUFF THAT WAS GOING ON.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.574
- TELL US, WHAT HAPPENED?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.476
- WELL, IT STARTED
BECAUSE CHAD--

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
I MEAN MR. FORBES--
HE WOULD DO THINGS

14:05.545 --> 14:08.015
LIKE HALTER-TOP INSPECTIONS
IN HIS OFFICE,

14:08.048 --> 14:10.183
ON HIS BOAT, ON HIS LAP,

14:10.217 --> 14:12.185
OR SOMETIMES
HE WOULD JUST UNTIE IT

14:12.219 --> 14:13.921
WHILE WE WERE HOLDING
A TRAY OF DRINKS.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.256
HE GOT OFF ON STUFF LIKE THAT.
- OBJECTION.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.159
YOUR HONOR, SHE'S SPECULATING
AS TO MY CLIENT'S STATE OF MIND.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.228
EVERYTHING HE DOES IS
IN THE INTEREST OF HIS BUSINESS.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.630
- OVERRULED, COUNSELOR.
THAT'S A BIG SWING.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.199
- CHAD HAS A BIG SWING
IN HIS OFFICE.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.501
HE USED TO MAKE US
PUSH THE NEW GIRLS

14:28.535 --> 14:30.070
AND POUR WATER ON THEM.

14:30.103 --> 14:30.971
- MM.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.176
- I THINK WE'RE DONE--
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.412
- WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT
THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.514
- OF COURSE.
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.051
- [clears throat]
MR. FORBES...

14:44.084 --> 14:45.418
- CALL ME CHAD.
- MAYBE I WILL.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.686
- THAT'D BE GREAT.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.021
- IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER
FOR ME ANYWAY.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.222
- GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.559
- SO, CHAD, LET'S TALK
ABOUT BJ KNOCKERS.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.527
WHAT IS THAT--
A, UH, FAMILY NAME?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.664
[chuckles]
- [laughs] NO, NO.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.000
IT'S JUST
SOMETHING I CAME UP WITH.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.601
YOU KNOW, KNOCKERS
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY,

15:01.634 --> 15:03.703
AND BJ--
WELL, IT'S KIND OF A NO-BRAINER.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.871
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE IN 8TH GRADE.

15:04.904 --> 15:10.110
- AND, UH, CHAD, WHAT TYPE
OF GIRL IS A KNOCKERS GIRL?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.578
- GOOD PERSONALITY.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.247
- I'LL REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE
UNDER OATH, SIR.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.450
- SO JUST GOOD PERSONALITY?
THAT'S IT?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.652
- MAYBE I SAID IT WRONG.
UM...

15:19.686 --> 15:22.455
A BJ KNOCKERS GIRL
HAS TO BE A GOOD SPORT,

15:22.489 --> 15:24.157
OTHERWISE SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO CUT IT.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.994
- A GOOD SPORT--
LIKE ON DECEMBER 21ST,

15:27.027 --> 15:29.496
WHEN SANDY ADAMS WAS SUPPOSED
TO WORK ON CHRISTMAS

15:29.529 --> 15:32.532
AND YOU LET HER OFF
IN EXCHANGE FOR A FOOT RUB.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.567
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
- HONESTLY, I DON'T.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.170
BUT I MAKE LOTS OF DEALS
WITH LOTS OF GIRLS.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.438
BUT IF IT'S IN THAT DIARY,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.073
I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT
THAT IT'S TRUE.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.541
- WELL, IT'S IN THE DIARY.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.011
- OH, GOOD.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.746
- DID THESE GIRLS THAT WORK
FOR YOU OBJECT?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.581
- NOT VERY OFTEN.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.485
IT WAS ALL IN GOOD FUN.
I'M A GOOD BOSS.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.488
I LOVE MY GIRLS.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.557
I PROTECT MY GIRLS.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.427
LOOK, I WON'T LIE.
WE GET SOME CREEPS IN THERE--

16:00.460 --> 16:03.030
FRAT BOYS, ATHLETES...

16:03.063 --> 16:05.465
COUPLE GUYS WHO KEEP PRETENDING
TO BE BLIND.

16:05.498 --> 16:10.370
BUT IF YOU TOUCH ONE OF MY GIRLS
IN A WAY THEY DON'T LIKE,

16:10.403 --> 16:13.173
I WILL TAKE YOU OUT TO SEA
AND DUMP YOU.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.409
- WELL, THERE ARE A LOT
OF INSTANCES IN THIS DIARY

16:16.443 --> 16:20.113
OF YOUR GIRLS BEING TREATED
IN A WAY THEY DIDN'T LIKE.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.616
- BREAKS MY HEART.
REALLY DOES.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.191
.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.259
- HOW DO I DEFEND CHAD FORBES,
FOUNDER OF BJ KNOCKERS?

16:34.794 --> 16:40.033
THE EVENTS DESCRIBED
IN THIS DIARY ARE INDEFENSIBLE.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.568
IN FACT, THE DEFENSE CONCEDES

16:41.601 --> 16:43.570
THAT ALL OF THE EVENTS
IN THIS DIARY

16:43.603 --> 16:46.239
WARRANT EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF OUR CHARGES.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.807
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE THROWING
A CURVEBALL, COUNSELOR.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.808
GET TO IT.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.278
- WITHOUT THE SWORN TESTIMONY
OF THE OWNER,

16:51.311 --> 16:52.412
THIS IS NOTHING BUT HEARSAY.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.715
WE MOVE THAT THIS DIARY
NOT BE ALLOWED INTO EVIDENCE.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.584
- I SEE YOUR POINT,
BUT THE COURT FEELS

16:57.617 --> 17:01.121
THAT THE DIARY CORROBORATES
MISS JAM'S TESTIMONY.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.489
MOTION DENIED.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.224
- AND IN ANTICIPATION
OF YOUR HONOR'S RULING,

17:04.257 --> 17:07.560
I HAVE ALREADY FILED
AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.397
- GREAT.
I LOVE INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.099
I ALSO LOVE LONG WALKS
ON THE BEACH.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.733
LUCKY FOR ME, I WORK IN A COURT,

17:13.766 --> 17:15.735
AND I LIVE PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE OCEAN,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.338
SO THE MORE "LOCUTORY,"
THE BETTER.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.339
I STAND BY MY RULING.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.274
- YOUR HONOR, WE BELIEVE
THE DIARY IS HEARSAY.

17:21.308 --> 17:21.974
I'VE CITED PRECEDENCE.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.344
- BUTTON YOUR SHIRT, COUNSELOR.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.514
- NOT YOU, HER.
- WHAT?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.249
- IF IT'S
IN THE ROOMMATE'S DIARY,

17:29.282 --> 17:31.618
WHY ISN'T SHE TESTIFYING?
IS THERE A REASON?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.187
- YES, BECAUSE SHE IS
ON A BEACH IN HER NEW CAR

17:34.221 --> 17:36.789
WITH A BAG OF DIAMONDS,
COUNTING HER HUSH MONEY.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.358
- EASY, TIGER--
DEFAMATION.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.427
- YOU'LL HAVE MY RULING
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.229
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.796
- GRACIAS.
- GRACIAS? REALLY?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.299
- MM-HMM.
- GROSS-IAS.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.270
- ALL RISE. THE HONORABLE--
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.305
PLEASE BE SEATED.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.242
JUDGE HERNANDEZ HAS RULED
THAT WITHOUT ITS AUTHOR PRESENT

17:55.275 --> 17:57.477
TO TESTIFY TO ITS VERACITY,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.579
THE DIARY IS INADMISSIBLE.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.714
SO, WHILE THE DEFENDANT
HIMSELF SAYS,

18:01.748 --> 18:04.317
"IF IT'S IN THE DIARY,
IT MUST BE TRUE,"

18:04.351 --> 18:05.585
THE ONLY THING THAT'S TRUE

18:05.618 --> 18:07.887
IS THAT EVEN HIS ADMISSIONS
ARE INADMISSIBLE.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.458
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO DISMISS THIS CASE.

18:11.491 --> 18:15.295
MR. FORBES, ON THE OTHER HAND,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.530
I HAVE A FEELING THE GREAT STATE
OF CALIFORNIA'S GONNA TAKE

18:17.564 --> 18:19.266
ANOTHER CRACK AT YOU.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.633
- IS THAT SO?
- YEAH, THAT'S SO.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.502
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS,

18:22.535 --> 18:25.838
AND I HAD BOSSES LIKE YOU,
AND I HAD CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.308
AND THE WORST OF THE WORST
JUST GOT A SLAP ON THE HAND

18:28.341 --> 18:30.477
OR A FINE EQUIVALENT
TO A CAR PAYMENT.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.346
BUT NOW WE TAKE THIS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.748
SO YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR BJ KNOCKERS,

18:35.782 --> 18:36.749
AND ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE

18:36.783 --> 18:40.653
IS ONE PAT ON THE ASS
AND ONE BRAVE WAITRESS--

18:40.687 --> 18:41.888
NOT THAT ONE, UNFORTUNATELY--

18:41.921 --> 18:43.590
AND YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.626
CASE DISMISSED.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.295
- OKAY, POINT IS, I THOUGHT
WE HAD HIM, GUYS, DIDN'T YOU?

18:48.328 --> 18:51.564
- NO, THEY'RE ATHLETES, MAN.
THEY WERE TRAINING FOR THIS.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.900
- REBECCA, WAIT UP!
- "REBECCA"?

18:53.933 --> 18:56.303
- HE CONTINUES TO BE
INCREDIBLY PRESUMPTUOUS.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.103
- HEY.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.272
- OH, GOD, YOU ARE
SO PREDICTABLE.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.308
- STEP AWAY FROM THE JUDGE.
- DON'T WORRY, TEDWARD.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.244
HE POSES ZERO THREAT TO ME.
- "ZERO THREAT"?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.878
- MR. FORBES, PLEASE.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.680
- HEY, HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.282
OH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
OOH, NICE GUN.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.617
WHAT, DO YOU SHOOT THAT
ONCE A YEAR ON THE RANGE?

19:10.650 --> 19:11.651
NO, DON'T PULL IT OUT.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.186
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP GIGGLING.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.787
CAN YOU COME HERE?
- NO, NO, I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.257
EXCEPT THAT THIS IS GOING TO END
BADLY FOR YOU.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.892
IT'S SIMPLE MATH.
- NO, I LIKE MATH.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.663
COME HERE, YOU LITTLE TEASE.
- OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.732
- OH!
- AAH!

19:28.335 --> 19:30.270
YES!

19:30.303 --> 19:32.905
THANK YOU,
BILLY WITH THE CHILI!

19:32.939 --> 19:35.442
ANY OF YOU GUYS WANT TO KICK
HIM IN THE NUTS,

19:35.475 --> 19:36.909
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.278
CA-CAW!

19:38.311 --> 19:39.812
- CA-CAW!

19:41.314 --> 19:42.449
- BOOM!
- [chuckles]

19:42.482 --> 19:43.750
- BILLY, I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.585
THANKS TO YOU, I MEAN...

19:45.618 --> 19:49.589
KNOCKING OUT CHAD FORBES WAS ONE
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.890
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.459
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I'D HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN

19:52.492 --> 19:54.294
AFTER YOU LEFT ME
IN THE IMPOUND LOT.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.395
- YEAH, I KNOW.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.997
I MEAN, THAT TRUCK--
IT JUST WANTS TO GO, YOU KNOW?

19:58.030 --> 19:58.998
- HEY, I WANTED TO MENTION--

19:59.031 --> 20:01.234
I STARTED READING ANOTHER BOOK
BECAUSE OF YOU.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
- THAT'S GREAT!

20:02.269 --> 20:04.003
- YEAH, THE TITLE'S BAD.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT A MOCKINGBIRD,

20:05.238 --> 20:07.307
BUT SO FAR, IT'S JUST ABOUT
A LITTLE GIRL IN THE SOUTH.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.309
I HOPE IT BECOMES ABOUT BIRDS.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.843
I LIKE ANIMAL STORIES.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.013
- BILLY, I CAN'T GO
TO THE FIREMAN'S BALL WITH YOU.

20:14.046 --> 20:14.881
- WELL, WE CAN GO DUTCH,

20:14.914 --> 20:16.683
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.618
I KNOW HOW INDEPENDENT YOU ARE.
- NO.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.788
NO, I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE THERE'S A, UM...

20:21.821 --> 20:23.290
THING BETWEEN--

20:23.323 --> 20:24.857
YOU'VE READ ONE BOOK.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.359
I--

20:26.393 --> 20:29.028
I'VE READ, LIKE,
1,000 OR MORE BOOKS.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.631
- [laughs]
YEAH.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.633
I AM SO RELIEVED.
- YEAH?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.001
- THE TRUTH IS,

20:35.034 --> 20:37.003
I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOU.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.739
I WAS FEELING BAD JUST SLEEPING
WITH YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE HOT.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.641
- OKAY.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.676
- BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

20:43.710 --> 20:46.446
IF YOU EVER
START READING LESS...

20:46.479 --> 20:50.417
GIVE ME A CALL, HUH?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.419
- SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
PROUD OF YOU.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.420
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.454
- I'M KIND OF ON A ROLL.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.788
I GOT BILLY CHECKED OFF
THE LIST.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.724
I GOT A CAR, AND I KNOW
THE STENOGRAPHER'S NAME.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.327
- AND WHAT'S HER--
WHAT'S HER NAME?
