WEBVTT

00:47.120 --> 00:52.480
It is my heartfelt pleasure and my greatest honour

00:47.120 --> 00:52.480
to claim this land,

00:52.520 --> 00:54.400
this island, on behalf of France,

00:55.560 --> 00:58.040
and call her Saint Marie!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.400
<i>Vive la France!</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:06.200
-Ryan! -Sorry!

01:06.240 --> 01:09.160
Okay, come on, guys, let's keep it together.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.160
We're nearly there!

01:09.200 --> 01:14.080
Good! So, erm, all right, come on, come on,

01:09.200 --> 01:14.080
come on, come on.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.880
Uh... <i> Vive la France!</i> <i>Vive le Roi!</i>

01:16.920 --> 01:19.920
ALL: <i>Vive la France! Vive le Roi!</i>

01:19.960 --> 01:23.040
Maybe one more rehearsal, we'll be fine tomorrow.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.000
No, look, if we've any chance of sticking to schedule,

01:25.040 --> 01:26.680
we'd best crack on with the food.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.800
You know how quick we lose the light

01:26.720 --> 01:28.800
this time of year.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.240
All right, well, no need to panic,

01:31.280 --> 01:32.880
plenty of time for foraging.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.280
Right, yes, uh, fact sheets, everybody.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.120
And don't forget we're rehearsing your speech

01:35.320 --> 01:38.120
straight after dinner.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.640
Well, I haven't even finished it yet.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.560
Right, I'm striking out this way.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.600
I've had enough of this! Who are you?

02:11.280 --> 02:12.960
If you've got something to say to me,

02:13.000 --> 02:14.520
say it to my face!

02:20.880 --> 02:22.960
Yes, Detective Inspector Goodman.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.480
Humphrey?

02:24.520 --> 02:25.760
Look it's Francis Davison,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.680
President of the Saint Marie Heritage Society.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.080
Look, I need to talk to you about something.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.600
Right, what do you think?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.680
<i>It's lovely.</i> <i>Really, really lovely.</i>

02:39.720 --> 02:41.440
No-one's forcing you to eat it.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.440
I think it's delicious, Imke.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.080
-IMKE: Thank you. -Well done for finding

02:43.480 --> 02:46.080
the recipe.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.920
Mmm, yeah. Imagine what we could've

02:46.120 --> 02:48.920
been eating if you hadn't.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.320
You going to give us a little flavour of your speech?

02:54.360 --> 02:55.680
Uh-uh! -Yeah, come on.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.040
-Go on! -ALL: Yeah, come on.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.280
Um... All right.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.840
Go on, Dad.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.840
Something along these lines.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.680
Uh...

03:12.160 --> 03:14.040
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:14.080 --> 03:17.640
on this weekend celebrating our island's history,

03:17.680 --> 03:20.720
welcome to the Saint Marie Heritage Society's tribute

03:21.920 --> 03:24.760
to those brave European men and women

03:24.800 --> 03:27.680
who risked life and limb crossing the ocean

03:27.720 --> 03:30.880
to discover our beautiful isle.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.200
MAN: Any numbness, loss of feeling?

03:45.880 --> 03:48.040
Excuse me. What's wrong,

03:45.880 --> 03:48.040
what's happening?

03:48.080 --> 03:49.440
Food poisoning, I think.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.400
Um, is Francis around

03:53.440 --> 03:56.320
He was here, he must be in his tent.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.200
Francis? It's Humphrey Goodman.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.840
We spoke earlier?

04:08.280 --> 04:09.400
HUMPHREY: Francis?

04:22.520 --> 04:23.960
Francis...

04:25.320 --> 04:26.600
Francis?

05:00.920 --> 05:02.800
So, it's been 461 years

05:02.840 --> 05:05.520
since the French first arrived on the island.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.480
So, how comes only a small band of ex-pats

05:07.520 --> 05:09.200
were the only ones celebrating it?

05:09.240 --> 05:11.080
Do the Brits celebrate the Romans invading them

05:11.120 --> 05:13.040
-We mark it.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.720
So, what's happened?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.880
Well, the Saint Marie Heritage Society had been

05:16.920 --> 05:19.920
rehearsing for tomorrow's re-enactment

05:16.920 --> 05:19.920
of the French landing.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.720
But half an hour after their evening meal,

05:21.760 --> 05:24.560
they all started to complain about stomach-ache.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.960
The victim, Francis Davison, came for a lie down.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.280
They all seem to have been hit by what looks

05:27.000 --> 05:30.280
like food poisoning.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.520
So, they've all eaten this stew. They've all been ill.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.240
Francis had a particularly bad reaction.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.160
Nothing suspicious in that.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.240
But, if I told you that no more than an hour ago,

05:40.280 --> 05:42.720
Francis called me, telling me that he

05:42.760 --> 05:45.960
thought someone was trying to kill him,

05:42.760 --> 05:45.960
what would you say then?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.600
Coincidence?

05:47.640 --> 05:51.680
I've got a feeling that if I say yes, you're going

05:47.640 --> 05:51.680
to say no.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.080
And I would say, what was that guy

05:51.720 --> 05:54.080
doing with your number?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.600
Yeah, well, um, yes, well, I, I considered joining them.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.440
It seemed a great way to meet new people.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.480
But then I got to know you lot and suddenly I realised

05:58.480 --> 06:01.480
I didn't need to.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.920
Anyway, can we move on?

06:03.960 --> 06:05.840
I don't think this is a coincidence.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.680
-Mmm-hmm.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.480
And let's get all the food and drink bagged up

06:09.520 --> 06:12.280
and sent to the lab for analysis.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.280
Any idea where Camille is?

06:12.320 --> 06:14.400
She said something about getting an early night.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.160
Oh, uh, no problem.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.640
Um, yes, well, there's not much

06:16.200 --> 06:18.640
more we can do

06:18.680 --> 06:19.920
until tomorrow anyway with this light.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.200
Um, yes, no problem at all.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.000
We'll get the tent sealed off, and maintain a police presence

06:26.040 --> 06:27.920
until daylight, to preserve the scene.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.320
Good, um... Yes.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.520
Thank you.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.920
Uh, look, Camille...

06:42.960 --> 06:46.400
Um, I know this is going to sound a little out

06:42.960 --> 06:46.400
of the blue.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.120
But I have been thinking long and hard about this.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.680
I, I go to sleep thinking about it,

06:51.720 --> 06:55.680
I, I wake up thinking about it, about you.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.920
Can't stop thinking about you.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.840
Do you have to do that?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.840
-Hey! -Ah.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.200
Just rehearsing my speech.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.560
You're giving a speech, for who?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.600
Oh, uh, no-one.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.840
Just in case I'm ever asked.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.000
Be prepared. Scout motto. Dib, dib, dib.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.560
-I'll be in the Jeep. -Yes.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.800
Not a word.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.600
Dwayne, how come you can spend all night on a beach

07:39.640 --> 07:41.080
and still look smarter than I do?

07:41.120 --> 07:43.400
-Practise. -Right.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.240
Ah, look at this. All this effort for nothing.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.400
Today's anniversary will pass and hardly anyone will notice.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.520
Okay. Tonight. You and me.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.200
I'll show you how the island really marks the anniversary.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.560
Oh, yes, I'd like that, Dwayne.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.440
Watch out.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.680
Right, so what have we got?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.960
Our victim sat down for his evening meal.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.840
They all complained of stomach pain.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.120
Francis came in here, lay down...

08:11.440 --> 08:12.960
-And died. -Yes.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.800
DWAYNE: No sign of a struggle.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.040
So, we have a change of clothes,

08:19.080 --> 08:21.960
the key to his Jeep, phone,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.840
wallet containing cards and cash.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.440
Now according to Francis's son,

08:23.880 --> 08:27.440
his journal is missing.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.200
Apparently, he relied quite heavily on it.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.920
It's what he wrote his notes and dates in.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.880
You think someone's stolen it

08:33.920 --> 08:37.000
Someone wanted to get hold of whatever's in the journal?

08:33.920 --> 08:37.000
Possibly.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.640
Maybe the answer's in that. Anything else?

08:39.680 --> 08:42.800
They had an authentic 16th-century recipe

08:39.680 --> 08:42.800
for the evening meal.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.960
I don't recognise any of these ingredients.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.920
Obviously, the post-mortem will confirm

08:46.960 --> 08:49.760
but that means it's looking unlikely Francis

08:46.960 --> 08:49.760
had a particularly

08:49.800 --> 08:51.720
severe reaction to the poison.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.520
The medics cleared at 4:30 in the morning.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.720
They were satisfied that the rest of the Society

08:53.560 --> 08:56.720
weren't in any danger,

08:56.760 --> 08:58.360
so they sent them home after treatment.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.400
Good.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.560
I've arranged to meet them at Catherine's bar.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.160
Any particular reason?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.240
It's where the Society meet each week.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.720
Yes, that's quite a good reason. Right.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.760
The boy is Ryan Davison, Francis's son.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.920
Someone's looking after him, I take it?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.960
Teresa Gower's looking after him

09:20.960 --> 09:22.960
for the time being.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.640
-His mother passed away some years ago.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.640
-Right.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.640
-Morning. -ALL: Good morning.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.040
I'm DI Goodman, this is DS Bordey.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.560
Thank you for agreeing to talk to us at what I know

09:31.080 --> 09:34.560
is a very difficult time.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.840
Could I start by taking your names, please?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.840
Oh, well, I'm Teresa Gower, Club Secretary.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.880
Uh, this is Henri Garon. Imke Sandt.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.760
And Ryan Davison.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.600
I'm really sorry for your loss, Ryan.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.920
Uh, so, could you talk me through

09:49.000 --> 09:51.920
what happened yesterday?

09:51.960 --> 09:56.400
Well, it was the final rehearsal

09:51.960 --> 09:56.400
for our re-enactment today.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.040
And we got to the beach, what, about ten?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.880
-Ten. -Yeah.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.040
Uh, set up the camp, rehearsed, and then

09:59.920 --> 10:03.040
prepared our evening meal.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.560
Right. So who was it who made the decision to serve stew?

10:06.600 --> 10:09.360
We were following an authentic recipe I found.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.080
Francis was very keen for us

10:11.120 --> 10:14.440
to relive the experience of the original settlers.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.600
Yeah. We all helped prepare it

10:16.640 --> 10:19.040
and foraged for other ingredients.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.960
-For the herbs.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.080
IMKE: <i> Teresa made</i> <i>a fact sheet for us</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:26.040
<i>and we foraged</i> <i>in the woods by the beach.</i>

10:27.440 --> 10:29.120
And once the stew was cooking,

10:29.160 --> 10:31.680
was there someone in attendance at all times?

10:31.720 --> 10:35.480
More or less. I mean, it was simmering for quite some time

10:35.520 --> 10:37.440
but we were never away for too long.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.160
And you didn't see anyone tamper with that?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.840
-Oh, no. No. -No.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.920
Oh, excuse me. Were you using that yesterday?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.920
Uh, yes. For Society archives.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.680
Well, maybe you caught something on it.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.440
Would it be possible to borrow it?

10:50.720 --> 10:53.440
With the memory cards?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.840
Yes, sure.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.760
Thank you.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.080
So, who was it who served up the stew,

11:00.120 --> 11:01.560
and how much did you have?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.480
We helped ourselves, we had a couple of bowls each.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.760
It's lovely. Really, really lovely.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.080
IMKE: No-one's forcing you to eat it.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.680
And Francis had the same?

11:12.720 --> 11:13.840
-Yes. -Yes.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.720
What can you tell me about Francis?

11:15.760 --> 11:19.560
He came to the island a year ago, with Ryan.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.680
Took over as President of the Society

11:19.600 --> 11:22.680
two months back.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.120
Everything you'd want your leader to be,

11:25.160 --> 11:28.320
enthusiastic, passionate,

11:28.360 --> 11:29.840
exactly about the same things as we are.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.040
How do you mean?

11:32.080 --> 11:34.320
Well, anything to do with the island, really.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.960
Loved the Society, too.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
We were like a little family, weren't we?

11:40.040 --> 11:43.680
Yes, um,  forgive me for asking

11:43.720 --> 11:47.440
but can you think of anyone who might have wanted

11:43.720 --> 11:47.440
to harm Francis?

11:47.480 --> 11:49.280
IMKE: No. HENRI: He was a popular man.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.880
I got your text.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.840
It's awful, it's just awful.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.400
Alan Butler.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.360
DI Goodman. You obviously knew Francis.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.320
Our paths crossed at the Society

12:03.360 --> 12:05.520
but I haven't set eyes on him since I left.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.800
-ALAN: About two months ago.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.680
Right, which would explain why you weren't on the beach.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.640
I was at home.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.960
-All afternoon.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.160
You see, because just before he died,

12:18.240 --> 12:19.640
Francis called me,

12:22.520 --> 12:24.640
saying, he was being threatened by someone.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.760
I think I'm being followed.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.360
Yeah, somebody's out to get me, I know it.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.320
Ryan, did your dad mention this at all?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.080
He said someone was threatening him?

12:37.360 --> 12:38.760
You think someone killed him?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.320
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.960
So, how come you didn't join the Society?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.840
Well, it was all prancing about the countryside,

12:54.880 --> 12:57.440
Didn't appeal?

12:57.480 --> 12:59.280
-No, I just don't have the legs for it.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.400
Hang on a sec...

13:01.440 --> 13:03.760
-We found a set of keys

13:01.440 --> 13:03.760
for a Jeep

13:03.800 --> 13:06.480
in Francis's belongings at the campsite.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.600
-Well, it wasn't parked

13:06.520 --> 13:08.600
at the beach,

13:09.840 --> 13:11.080
it isn't here.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.160
So where is it?

13:25.120 --> 13:28.800
Captain Howarth's Chronicles, major 18th-century explorer

13:28.840 --> 13:30.400
and biological archivist.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.600
Knocks Darwin into a cocked hat,

13:30.440 --> 13:33.600
in my humble.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.120
Yes, yes, I'm, I'm working.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.160
-Yes, yes, yes, yes...

13:51.120 --> 13:54.080
Ah, the Heritage Society accounts book.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.600
Mmm.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.880
Ah!

13:58.920 --> 14:01.560
Francis said he was receiving threatening letters

13:58.920 --> 14:01.560
when he called me.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.120
Interesting.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.280
What?

14:11.320 --> 14:13.160
Unless I'm not reading this properly,

14:13.200 --> 14:18.160
it looks like the Society is $4,000 out of a pocket.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.760
Yes, it's, um... Out of pocket.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.840
-Out of... -I've got it!

14:24.880 --> 14:25.960
Okay.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.560
Dwayne, they'll need checking for fingerprints.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.560
Also we need to contact Ryan, ask him if he knows

14:32.600 --> 14:35.560
where his dad's Jeep is.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.760
-Too young, he's only 16.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.400
We found the Society accounts book

14:42.440 --> 14:44.960
and it looks like they are 4k in the red.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.520
If we find out why, it could help

14:45.000 --> 14:48.520
with the investigation.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.240
I'll request financial checks.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.000
And Dwayne's made a start on Francis Davison's e-mails.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.680
Mmm-hmm. Right.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.360
So, President of the Saint Marie

14:54.720 --> 14:57.360
Heritage Society,

14:57.400 --> 14:58.920
Francis Davison. He came here two years ago.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.360
He tutors private pupils in Caribbean history.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.720
He's also writing a book about the history

15:03.400 --> 15:05.720
of Saint Marie

15:05.760 --> 15:07.240
while he's here.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.360
And running the Heritage Society.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.360
Busy man. Henri Garon.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.480
Single. Moved to the island 18 months ago

15:10.400 --> 15:14.480
from his hometown of Antibes.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.640
He's an accountant at the Three Sails Hotel.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.440
Member of various clubs, scuba diving, yacht club.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.640
A social butterfly.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.200
Quite. Imke Sandt.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.800
Dutch national. Single, no children.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.480
She worked as a primary school teacher for eight years,

15:28.520 --> 15:30.480
then gave it up to become a travel rep.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.920
Teresa Gower?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.360
Secretary for the Society. Unmarried.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.120
Moved here six years ago,

15:36.160 --> 15:39.200
following the death of her father

15:36.160 --> 15:39.200
back in the UK.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.640
Librarian at the Port Royal Library.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.000
Ryan Davison?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.720
16, moved here with his dad.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.840
His mother passed away some years ago.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.680
Straight-A student back in the UK.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.080
Which, just leaves Alan Butler,

15:52.120 --> 15:54.240
ex-member of the Society.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.880
He moved here following early retirement.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.280
Middle management for 25 years at

15:59.080 --> 16:02.280
the Hertfordshire Water Board.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
Sergeant in the Territorial Army.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.680
Where are my... My notes?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.000
Inside left.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.440
Inside left... Ah, yes. Well done, Florence.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.360
So...

16:15.400 --> 16:17.960
Five people gather ingredients for an evening meal,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.840
prepare it, cook it and help themselves.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.280
They eat the same food, they drink the same drink,

16:23.320 --> 16:26.800
they all suffer food poisoning and one dies.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.760
To all intents and purposes, it's a terrible accident.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.840
Except that one hour before his death, the victim calls me

16:33.880 --> 16:35.960
and confesses that he fears for his life.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.680
And his journal's gone missing from the campsite.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.640
Indeed it has. The journal has

16:37.720 --> 16:40.640
to be significant.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.440
All of which means that his death is much more likely

16:40.680 --> 16:43.440
to have been murder

16:43.480 --> 16:45.040
than some awful coincidence.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.040
-Path and lab results are in.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.480
Francis died from eating a large amount

16:50.520 --> 16:52.320
of the poison water hemlock.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.840
Water hemlock?

16:53.880 --> 16:57.120
It's found only in woodland areas

16:53.880 --> 16:57.120
near the coast.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.160
FLORENCE: Fast acting, in a highly

16:57.160 --> 17:00.160
concentrated dosage.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.560
Death would occur within 30 minutes.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.680
It would seem somehow he had a much larger

17:04.720 --> 17:07.640
amount of the poison in his system

17:04.720 --> 17:07.640
than anybody else.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.560
And did the lab say where the poison was?

17:09.600 --> 17:12.360
Only in the stew, everything else was clear.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.840
Not a trace showed up in any of the water or wine.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.400
Well, then, how did Francis consume

17:17.440 --> 17:19.800
more poison than any of the others?

17:19.840 --> 17:21.640
I don't know, he ate more stew?

17:21.680 --> 17:23.600
No, they all ate the same.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.680
Could the poison be more concentrated

17:25.720 --> 17:28.320
in one part of the stew than the other?

17:28.360 --> 17:30.440
Then how did the killer ensure that it was Francis

17:30.480 --> 17:32.520
who got that particular portion?

17:32.560 --> 17:34.400
Especially when they served themselves.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.480
It's all too random.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.080
It's a bit like a Christmas pudding.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.080
-Christmas pudding.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.960
It's an old tradition in the UK,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.520
hide a silver sixpence in the pud.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.960
If you got it in your portion, you kept it.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.080
Let me see, then.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.640
No.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.240
No water hemlock in the Society fact sheet

17:51.680 --> 17:55.240
Teresa handed out.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.680
Here's what it looks like.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.440
Looks quite similar to this herb,

18:01.480 --> 18:05.440
the Society should have been foraging for,

18:01.480 --> 18:05.440
pound-cake bush.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.000
Could have been picked up accidentally,

18:07.040 --> 18:10.000
and thrown in the stew. It looks almost identical.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.240
Yes, uh, Dwayne, if you can get down

18:10.040 --> 18:12.240
to the woods near the beach,

18:12.280 --> 18:15.440
-see if this water hemlock actually grows there.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.440
-Chief.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.560
I'll look through the camcorder footage,

18:17.600 --> 18:19.920
see if that sheds any light on who may have put something

18:17.600 --> 18:19.920
in the stew.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.040
Mmm-hmm.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.880
I think I have something on the $4,000 mystery.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.560
E-mail exchanges between Francis and Teresa.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.920
Looks like she was the Society's treasurer

18:28.600 --> 18:31.920
as well as the secretary.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.560
She never mentioned that when we spoke.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.880
Hardly surprising. Francis was on to her.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.560
He knew it was her who'd put the Society in debt.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.840
And get this, they agreed to sort it out

18:41.880 --> 18:44.480
on the morning of the rehearsal.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.360
The morning of the day he died.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
-Hello again. -Oh, hello.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.400
We thought we may as well get on with it,

18:55.440 --> 18:59.400
sooner rather than later.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.120
Hopefully keep his mind off things, bless him.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.800
Could we have a quiet word?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.600
Of course. Um, Ryan, darling, could you carry on without me?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Okay.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.680
Oh, by the way, Ryan,

19:11.720 --> 19:14.040
do you have any idea where your dad's Jeep is?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.720
Is it not at the house?

19:15.760 --> 19:16.920
Doesn't look like it.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.920
I'm sure it'll turn up.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.720
Teresa, um, we're looking into possible motives

19:29.760 --> 19:31.480
people may have had to kill Francis.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.760
Was there anyone he'd fallen out with?

19:31.520 --> 19:33.760
Any issues he had?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.760
Uh, none that I know of.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.080
And how did you get on?

19:39.120 --> 19:42.040
Uh, well. Good. I liked him.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.880
Right, so how did he react

19:43.920 --> 19:46.520
when he discovered that you'd taken

19:43.920 --> 19:46.520
the Society bank account

19:46.560 --> 19:48.520
into the red and used the cash for your own use?

19:53.120 --> 19:56.240
I... I was stupid.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.240
Desperate.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.760
He was furious. Quite rightly.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.600
-No.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.720
Just asked that I repay the money. And quick.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.480
The only way I could raise the cash would be

20:08.760 --> 20:11.480
to sell up here, go home.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.720
And I love it. I love it so much.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.200
Most of the other members of the Society

20:18.240 --> 20:19.840
ended up on Saint Marie through their work.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.160
What brought you here?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.080
Well, I saw the island on a documentary.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.080
Fell in love immediately.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.400
Promised myself that one day I...

20:31.680 --> 20:34.920
This was the one thing that kept me going

20:31.680 --> 20:34.920
when my dad was ill.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.560
I was his sole carer and it was...

20:42.400 --> 20:44.640
Pretty lonely at times.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.440
Yes, that's not too difficult to understand.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.400
It didn't work out quite as I'd planned.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.040
Why is that?

20:51.080 --> 20:53.880
Oh, I arrived with a lot less in the bank

20:51.080 --> 20:53.880
than I anticipated.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.600
Most of what my dad was going to leave me in his will

20:55.640 --> 20:59.520
had been spent on his health care.

20:55.640 --> 20:59.520
Then the funeral.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.120
But I was determined to start again.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.680
With Francis dead, your secret's safe,

21:04.720 --> 21:06.960
no-one would ever know what you'd done.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.520
Actually, um, he talked me out of it.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.560
I was determined to sell, pay back what I owe and go.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.000
But, Francis very kindly said

21:15.040 --> 21:16.840
I could pay off what I'd taken in instalments.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.240
When did he say that?

21:18.280 --> 21:21.680
Well, I went round to his place

21:18.280 --> 21:21.680
the morning he died.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.760
TERESA GOWER: <i> I thought</i> <i>I'd be walking into</i>

21:21.720 --> 21:24.760
<i>some huge barney,</i>

21:24.800 --> 21:28.320
<i>but, um, he was so gentle.</i> <i>So understanding.</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:34.440
Teresa, where do these go?

21:34.480 --> 21:37.640
Oh, big box in my car, love. Look, I'll help you.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.400
-Yes, of course.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.840
-Oh, nothing to worry

21:42.400 --> 21:44.840
your head about, sweetheart.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.480
Just asking about your dad.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.120
You think she's telling the truth?

21:55.160 --> 21:57.680
You think $4,000 is worth killing someone for?

21:57.720 --> 21:59.520
People have died for far less.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.680
And what if Francis wasn't quite as understanding

22:01.720 --> 22:03.320
as Teresa's making out?

22:10.200 --> 22:14.400
Oh, this brings it all back.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.520
Disco in the village hall. Slow dances. Young love.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.040
What was her name?

22:21.480 --> 22:23.960
Your young love. They say you never forget.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.240
Ah, um, Gillian Ratcliffe.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.280
She wasn't mine, friend's girl.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.160
I was holding his coat until the dance had finished.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.560
Great song, though.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.080
Could never be written by an Englishman,

22:38.120 --> 22:39.680
far too direct. What would an Englishman sing?

22:41.320 --> 22:45.440
Uh, dunno. Beatles, <i> She Loves You.</i>

22:45.480 --> 22:48.240
Not I love you, but she loves you.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.520
Fella concerned couldn't probably

22:48.280 --> 22:50.520
bring himself to say it.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.560
Say what?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.400
I love you.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.840
Well, I have no patience for a man like that.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.320
Got something to say, say it.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.440
It's not that easy sometimes.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.000
And what if she didn't feel the same?

23:07.040 --> 23:09.400
He'd be emotionally repressed, high maintenance.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.760
What woman would go for a man like that?

23:11.800 --> 23:14.040
Yeah. Quite.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.920
Oh!

23:53.520 --> 23:55.400
Dwayne, where are you?

23:55.440 --> 23:57.280
DWAYNE: <i> I'm in the woods.</i>

23:57.320 --> 23:59.360
Okay. I need you to do something for me.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.400
<i>There's an opening,</i> <i>leading to the beach.</i>

24:02.400 --> 24:04.120
Ah, got it.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.520
Head towards it but stop maybe

24:06.560 --> 24:09.760
ten metres away, so that the opening

24:06.560 --> 24:09.760
is directly in front of you.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.760
I've stopped.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.400
You're hiding in the trees, aren't you?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.240
This is going to end up on one of those TV shows,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.560
where you scare the life out of me and get $250, eh?

24:19.600 --> 24:23.000
Dwayne, please concentrate. Three metres to your left,

24:23.040 --> 24:25.360
there should be a small clearing.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.280
Yes.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.280
Are there any discarded cigarettes?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.120
No.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.600
Yes.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.000
Great! Bag them!

24:38.040 --> 24:41.000
How did you know that

24:41.040 --> 24:42.600
Just bag them, Dwayne.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.560
All right,

24:44.600 --> 24:46.160
I'm bagging, I'm bagging!

24:50.720 --> 24:53.640
Water hemlock. Found exactly where we thought it would be.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.040
In the wood near the campsite.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.840
It's so similar to the rest of the herbs

24:56.880 --> 25:00.240
someone must have picked it, put it in the pot and <i> voila.</i>

24:56.880 --> 25:00.240
Big mistake.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.120
Yes, possibly. But it still doesn't explain

25:02.160 --> 25:05.480
how an excess of the same poison

25:02.160 --> 25:05.480
ended up in Francis's system.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.240
Uh, I don't suppose you came across his journal

25:07.280 --> 25:08.720
lying about in the woods, did you?

25:08.760 --> 25:12.080
-No, Chief. -I'm convinced

25:08.760 --> 25:12.080
it's significant.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.760
I spoke to Ryan about his father's Jeep,

25:14.800 --> 25:16.880
he's no idea where it is.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.400
Dwayne, could you put the feelers out?

25:18.440 --> 25:21.840
Um.. Garages, second-hand dealers,

25:18.440 --> 25:21.840
scrapyards...

25:21.880 --> 25:25.360
Thieves, scoundrels... Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, Chief,

25:21.880 --> 25:25.360
leave it with me.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.600
Got you!

25:28.640 --> 25:31.040
This is footage from the woods near the beach.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.080
See? Just here. A silhouette.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.320
Difficult to see. Male or female?

25:36.360 --> 25:39.000
Can't tell. But, fast forward an hour...

25:40.160 --> 25:42.120
He or she, is still there.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.760
What's that? That's a spark of light.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.480
Oh! Well done, team. Get them to the lab,

25:52.520 --> 25:54.560
get the saliva tested for the DNA.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.520
Ah, we may not need to. I found this.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.600
This is on the Heritage Society

26:00.000 --> 26:02.600
blog page.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.240
Alan is the only one smoking.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.120
And the brand, the pack before him

26:08.160 --> 26:10.440
on the table is Black Strand.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.560
Snap!

26:12.240 --> 26:13.480
Oh, well done, Florence.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.160
-Yeah. -Sterling work.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.880
-Yes, and you, Dwayne.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.400
So, Alan was lying.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.520
He was in the wood, near the Society camp.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.040
Yes, and if it was him, then he'd have had

26:23.080 --> 26:25.160
the perfect opportunity to poison the stew.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.720
Sorry to disturb you.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.800
30 lengths a day, keeps the doctor away.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.320
-Yeah. -Uh...

26:53.360 --> 26:57.360
So, you're the ex-President of the Saint Marie

26:53.360 --> 26:57.360
Heritage Society?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.200
Guilty as charged.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.200
Any particular reason you left?

27:01.240 --> 27:03.120
Well, I'd been at the helm ten years.

27:03.160 --> 27:06.280
Decided to take a back seat, give someone else a chance

27:03.160 --> 27:06.280
at the wheel.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.280
That someone being Francis Davison.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.960
Yes, we've seen the Society's blog page.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.880
Looks like you all had some good times.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.640
Fantastic group of people.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.480
Enthusiastic, cultured, very friendly.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.440
Then why resign?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.920
My wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.720
I'm sorry.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.040
I resigned from the Society so we could spend

27:29.080 --> 27:31.800
what little time she had left together.

27:31.840 --> 27:36.200
Then, when she died, I decided not to go back.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.200
Hmm, right, well, then how come

27:36.240 --> 27:39.200
you spent a number of hours

27:39.240 --> 27:43.040
watching the group from the woods, on the day

27:39.240 --> 27:43.040
of the re

27:43.080 --> 27:45.680
You go to the camp, acquire some water hemlock

27:45.720 --> 27:47.680
and when the Society members aren't looking,

27:47.720 --> 27:49.760
slip it into the stew and leave unnoticed.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.000
You think I killed Francis? That's preposterous.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.920
We can prove you were at the woods. But why?

27:56.320 --> 27:57.600
Revenge?

28:05.880 --> 28:07.840
HUMPHREY: Ah, the journal at last.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.440
It belonged to Francis.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.480
Everything he did or was going to do

28:09.480 --> 28:13.480
with the Society,

28:13.520 --> 28:16.800
including the speech he was meant to give today,

28:13.520 --> 28:16.800
is in there.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.800
ALAN: <i>I thought, if I took it...</i>

28:24.840 --> 28:26.880
Today's celebrations would fall apart.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.600
I wanted him humiliated. To feel a little

28:30.800 --> 28:32.480
of what I felt.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.320
Why did the two of you fall out?

28:37.360 --> 28:40.240
We clashed over several events on the Society's calendar.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.600
Every year, we commemorate the British invasion

28:40.280 --> 28:43.600
of the island.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.520
But Francis arrives and suddenly,

28:45.560 --> 28:49.280
the whole thing apparently possesses a very dark tone,

28:49.320 --> 28:50.800
it's too colonial,

28:50.840 --> 28:53.000
celebrates thuggery over the islanders.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.320
Yes, I imagine there is a sensitivity required.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.640
We just waved a few flags, sang <i> God Save The Queen,</i>

28:57.680 --> 28:59.960
and marched up Main Street in military uniform,

29:02.720 --> 29:05.200
What's wrong with a bit of old

29:06.120 --> 29:07.880
You argued with Francis?

29:08.400 --> 29:10.120
All the time.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.280
The last straw was when he cancelled the celebration

29:12.320 --> 29:15.200
and replaced it with what should have

29:12.320 --> 29:15.200
happened today.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.760
Oh, the arrival of the first European settlers

29:15.240 --> 29:18.760
on the island.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.120
How does that differ from the Brits landing?

29:21.160 --> 29:24.040
How is one invading force better than another?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.920
So, Francis insults you by changing

29:24.080 --> 29:26.920
the Society calendar,

29:26.960 --> 29:29.160
making it almost impossible for you to stay.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.840
In a nutshell.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.280
And puts you under pressure at the very time

29:30.880 --> 29:34.280
you needed his help.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.680
When your wife was ill.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.560
HUMPHREY: Yes, I can't imagine how you must have felt.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.800
Your wife desperately ill, Francis putting you

29:40.840 --> 29:42.680
under enormous strain.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.440
I don't think I'd blame you if you wanted revenge.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.560
Look, Inspector. I admit it! I didn't like the man.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.440
But I swear, I didn't want him dead.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.520
Yes, indeed, yes.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.880
So, it turns out Alan Butler stole Francis's journal

29:58.920 --> 30:00.760
but claims he didn't kill him for it.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.400
so It'd be good to know what's in it. Would you mind,

30:00.800 --> 30:03.400
Florence? Thank you.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.200
So, yesterday, the Saint Marie Heritage Society

30:06.240 --> 30:08.160
sat down for their meal.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.920
One of them, or this man,

30:09.960 --> 30:13.240
managed to get some poisonous water hemlock into the stew.

30:13.280 --> 30:17.480
Somehow, Francis ingested more of the poison

30:13.280 --> 30:17.480
than anybody else,

30:17.520 --> 30:20.080
despite the fact that we know that all of the other

30:20.120 --> 30:23.400
consumables at the camp contained no trace

30:20.120 --> 30:23.400
of the poison.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.960
So how did that happen?

30:26.000 --> 30:29.720
How did our killer ensure that it was Francis who died?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.800
No, we're not getting anywhere here.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.800
So, let's sleep on it and come at it fresh

30:34.840 --> 30:36.800
in the morning.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.320
Right, Dwayne, meet you in an hour.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.000
You and me, suits and boots.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.120
Yes... But maybe in something a little less formal,

30:42.040 --> 30:46.120
eh, Chief?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.040
Good night, Florence.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.680
Good night, sir. Have fun.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.880
Yes, and you.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.640
Okay, Chief, you're about to witness

31:07.680 --> 31:09.840
the best thing the Brits brought with them

31:07.680 --> 31:09.840
when they invaded.

31:09.880 --> 31:12.920
The humble British pub, without the fighting.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.120
Wow. This place is amazing, Dwayne!

31:37.360 --> 31:40.480
-Crikey! -Indeed, and plenty of it.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.560
Marco?

31:44.120 --> 31:45.880
Yes...we need...

31:49.960 --> 31:51.160
Camille!

31:53.960 --> 31:55.080
Camille!

31:55.800 --> 31:57.480
Oh! I'm terribly sorry!

31:57.840 --> 31:59.040
Yes...

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
Whoo!

32:08.680 --> 32:10.520
It's always the quiet ones, eh?

32:11.640 --> 32:12.800
Two beers, large.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.560
And two rums, larger!

32:23.200 --> 32:25.680
-To Francis! -ALL: To Francis!

32:25.720 --> 32:27.640
So... Going anywhere nice?

32:27.680 --> 32:30.320
If you're angling for information...

32:30.360 --> 32:33.920
This is your second date in as many days.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.280
-Good night, Maman. -Tell me his name at least,

32:33.960 --> 32:36.280
Camille!

32:36.320 --> 32:37.600
Uh-uh!

32:38.560 --> 32:40.320
Oh, ah, Monsieur Garon.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.920
No, Henri, please.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.000
Will it be possible to get my camera back soon?

32:45.040 --> 32:48.120
Well, I'm sorry, it's still part of

32:45.040 --> 32:48.120
an ongoing investigation.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.320
Oh. I see.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.280
Well, then, have a very nice evening.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.800
Thank you.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.600
<i>-Vive la France!</i> -Yes! <i> Vive la France!</i>

32:59.640 --> 33:01.680
So, what about you

33:02.760 --> 33:04.840
You know what, Dwayne? I have.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.680
Not here, though. Somewhere else.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.840
So, why you here getting drunk with me?

33:11.880 --> 33:13.520
Shouldn't you be wherever she is?

33:13.560 --> 33:17.080
Well, we haven't really, sort of, um, got round to,

33:13.560 --> 33:17.080
kind of,

33:17.120 --> 33:19.280
talking about it.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.360
-Well, I'm building up to it,

33:21.400 --> 33:23.880
just trying to find the right moment.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.920
There never is a right moment. Just get in there, the man!

33:26.960 --> 33:28.560
You think?

33:28.600 --> 33:30.760
Look, when things aren't quite going the way I want them to,

33:30.800 --> 33:32.040
I have this little trick.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.280
-It works every time. -I'm all ears. All ears.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.400
Women need a hero, so be that hero.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.080
Sweep her off her feet. Let her fall into your arms.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.640
Yes, but how?

33:44.680 --> 33:46.280
Contrive a little mishap.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.760
And before any real danger occurs,

33:47.800 --> 33:50.000
you just sweep in there and save the day.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.480
After that, she'll be like putty in your hands. Trust me.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.120
I can see that working for you, Dwayne,

33:56.160 --> 33:58.960
but, you see, I'm not really the action hero type.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.120
If you don't try, you'll never know.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.240
Uh-huh.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.560
Whoo! Ah!

34:09.600 --> 34:12.120
-You, sir, are a gent and a scholar.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.560
Night-night, Dwayne, and thanks.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.240
I'll see you bright and early, Chief.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.200
Ah...

34:22.360 --> 34:24.600
Maybe not so bright and maybe not so early.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.640
Cami...

35:00.960 --> 35:02.120
-Good morning. -Good morning.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.040
-Brilliant.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.720
Quite inebriated, actually, painted the town red,

35:04.080 --> 35:06.720
eh, Dwayne?

35:06.760 --> 35:08.360
And quite a few other colours, too.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.360
Good night, yourself?

35:11.400 --> 35:13.680
-Yes, sure. Quiet. -Mmm-hmm.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.480
-Um, this is the video from the Heritage Society again.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.840
<i>You going to give us</i> <i>a little flavour</i>

35:16.520 --> 35:18.840
<i>of your speech?</i>

35:18.880 --> 35:22.920
I bumped into Henri and he mentioned

35:18.880 --> 35:22.920
getting his camera back.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.560
There is something not right.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.720
Anything show in Francis's journal?

35:26.760 --> 35:28.960
Notes on the re-enactment, his speech,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.120
but nothing of any significance.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.720
Apart from a mobile phone number

35:32.760 --> 35:34.920
and the initials, GO, beside it.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.760
It was one of the last entries.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.760
I've left a message for them to get back to me.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.240
Okay.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.680
Chief? I just had a call from Honest Eddie.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.200
He's one of my contacts.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.360
He said a Jeep has just been seen at the lock-ups

35:45.240 --> 35:48.360
down on the coast.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.160
And it matches the description of the missing Jeep?

35:50.200 --> 35:52.720
Perfectly. Apart from the windows.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.360
They've been broken, apparently.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.160
-Yes.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
Okay.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.440
<i>Uh...</i>

36:00.480 --> 36:01.720
Nothing?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.360
<i>-Ladies and gentlemen...</i> -No.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
Maybe he really did just want his camera back.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.440
FRANCIS:  <i>Welcome to</i>

36:07.360 --> 36:09.440
<i>the Saint Marie Heritage...</i>

36:11.560 --> 36:14.440
I think you might need to rename Honest Eddie.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.800
Lying Eddie?

36:16.840 --> 36:18.800
At the very least, Mistaken Eddie.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.640
Look, if he said he saw it, he saw it.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.120
Dwayne, there must be a thousand Jeeps like...

36:23.160 --> 36:24.320
That one. Hey!

36:28.720 --> 36:29.800
Head him off!

36:41.440 --> 36:42.680
Stop!

36:43.680 --> 36:44.840
Come on!

36:46.240 --> 36:47.520
Let's go!

36:50.240 --> 36:52.160
What's wrong?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.760
Dwayne, if you could search Ryan's bedroom?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.000
Ryan, what's happened?

37:03.720 --> 37:07.000
What were you doing with the Jeep, Ryan?

37:07.040 --> 37:09.520
Just wanted to get out of here. Get away.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.280
We told you, your Dad's Jeep was missing,

37:11.320 --> 37:13.120
you said you didn't know anything about it.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.120
Why was that?

37:15.480 --> 37:17.160
Why were the windows smashed?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.640
Why were you trying to set fire to it?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.640
Trying to destroy evidence?

37:22.760 --> 37:24.280
Open on his desk.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
HUMPHREY: Ah.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.000
You need to talk.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.400
You sent your father threatening letters,

37:28.040 --> 37:31.400
you poisoned him.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.880
No! Okay, I sent the letters, yes, and the Jeep,

37:34.920 --> 37:36.840
I smashed the windows but I didn't poison him.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.920
I just wanted to scare him,

37:39.960 --> 37:42.280
I just wanted him to...

37:42.320 --> 37:44.000
I don't know, just notice that I was there.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.800
It was great when we first arrived.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.120
I thought we'd be fine.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.040
But it's, it's hard to make friends, you know,

37:51.160 --> 37:54.040
it takes time.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.800
And he was always so busy. Throwing himself

37:54.080 --> 37:56.800
into everything.

37:56.840 --> 38:00.360
Teaching, writing, the Society...

38:00.400 --> 38:03.720
<i>I even started going</i> <i>to the meetings myself,</i>

38:00.400 --> 38:03.720
<i>to spend time with him.</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
<i>He hardly even noticed</i> <i>I was there.</i>

38:07.040 --> 38:09.680
<i>Teresa saw what he was like.</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:12.200
I'm going to get another drink.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.200
Do you want one?

38:12.240 --> 38:14.560
He was just so passionate about everything.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.600
I'm sorry.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.920
I know it was wrong but I just lashed out.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.120
Just wanted a dad.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.400
Yes, well, you should have told us.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.360
Is there anything else, Ryan?

38:29.400 --> 38:32.560
Anything that can help us find out who did this

38:29.400 --> 38:32.560
to your father?

38:32.600 --> 38:34.560
Well, I... I heard Dad arguing on the phone.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.320
Who with?

38:36.360 --> 38:39.200
I don't know. But Dad sounded pretty angry.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.320
Look, we've talked about this, it ends here, it ends now.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.960
Do you understand?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.960
When was this?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.320
Three nights ago.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.600
Camille, the list of members' phone numbers

38:55.640 --> 38:57.960
from the Heritage Society, please.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.880
So. Three days ago...

39:02.120 --> 39:03.600
No calls after 6:30,

39:03.640 --> 39:06.280
until this one here at 9:00, about the time Ryan said,

39:07.600 --> 39:09.080
and another two.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.640
Number belongs to Imke Sandt.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.720
Right.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.360
Grab yourselves a drink and meet me back at the coach,

39:18.400 --> 39:20.320
okay? <i> Merci!</i>

39:22.280 --> 39:25.360
-Yes.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.080
We looked through Francis's call record

39:25.400 --> 39:28.080
on his mobile.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.640
You made three calls to him on the same night. Why?

39:32.600 --> 39:34.200
I'm sorry, I...

39:36.520 --> 39:38.320
You see, the night before he died,

39:38.360 --> 39:40.600
his son heard Francis arguing with someone

39:40.640 --> 39:43.640
on the phone, around the same time as you called him.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.920
You were heard arguing and the next day he was dead.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.000
Ryan said he heard Francis saying,

39:46.960 --> 39:50.000
"This has to end here."

39:52.760 --> 39:54.960
Were you having a relationship with Francis?

39:56.160 --> 39:58.560
I was so tired of this...

39:58.600 --> 40:01.320
Knowing people for no more than

39:58.600 --> 40:01.320
the length of their holiday,

40:01.360 --> 40:05.000
then they'd be off and replaced with

40:01.360 --> 40:05.000
a new coach-load of people

40:05.040 --> 40:06.400
you'd never see again.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.640
You mean men?

40:09.760 --> 40:11.320
Yeah.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.720
It's not the ideal place to start a relationship.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.880
So, what did Francis offer?

40:16.560 --> 40:18.200
Stability.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.880
He had the house, the kid.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.960
For the first time in my life, he made that kind of thing

40:21.920 --> 40:25.960
seem attractive.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.360
But he ended it?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.160
I thought things were going well between us.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.000
But I guess I got it wrong. He didn't feel the same.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.320
So you called him?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.360
I didn't want to believe it was over.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.000
I pleaded with him not to end it.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.760
It's not the most attractive thing to do, is it?

40:46.440 --> 40:49.040
Beg someone to stay.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.400
But I guess you do stupid things

40:49.080 --> 40:51.400
when you're in love.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.480
Thank you.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.440
Thank you.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.080
It's funny, isn't it?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.960
You can live in paradise

41:09.000 --> 41:11.160
and yet still have exactly the same troubles

41:09.000 --> 41:11.160
as if you were living in,

41:11.200 --> 41:12.800
oh, I dunno, Grimsby... Ooh.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.160
Not that there's anything wrong with Grimsby.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.840
We're all under the same sky. If you're not loved,

41:18.200 --> 41:20.840
you're not loved.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.960
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

41:38.000 --> 41:40.200
What did you think you were doing?

41:40.240 --> 41:42.480
I, I just saw the bloody chicken man,

41:40.240 --> 41:42.480
I just thought...

41:43.240 --> 41:44.720
Hang on, I'll save you.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.760
Save me? Oh, don't you dare! I'm perfectly capable

41:46.800 --> 41:48.800
of doing this on my own!

41:52.480 --> 41:53.520
Idiot!

41:58.000 --> 41:59.200
Don't go there!

42:07.640 --> 42:09.520
Well, we now know that Francis

42:09.560 --> 42:11.960
wasn't actually being victimised,

42:09.560 --> 42:11.960
it was just his son

42:12.000 --> 42:14.480
trying desperately to get his father's attention.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.080
If Ryan is to be believed,

42:16.120 --> 42:18.240
the threatening letters have nothing to do with the murder.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.280
Maybe this was just a tragic accident.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.440
Thank you.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.480
HUMPHREY: But the levels of toxin in Francis

42:24.520 --> 42:27.120
were too high to be accidental.

42:27.160 --> 42:30.600
Sir, I think we're getting somewhere.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.760
The number I found earlier in Francis's journal.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.880
It belonged to a Guillaume Orme,

42:32.800 --> 42:35.880
he's an accountant.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.640
According to him, Francis contacted him

42:37.680 --> 42:39.440
on the morning of the re-enactment,

42:39.480 --> 42:42.680
asking him to block Teresa's access to the Society's

42:39.480 --> 42:42.680
bank account.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.640
Well, who can blame him for that?

42:44.680 --> 42:48.400
Guillaume also told me he'd advised Francis to insist

42:44.680 --> 42:48.400
Teresa leaves the Society.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.120
-Francis said he'd already

42:48.440 --> 42:51.120
done it that morning.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.560
She never mentioned that.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.280
I wonder what else she's been lying about.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.160
FLORENCE: What's that noise?

42:59.240 --> 43:00.960
I thought that had finished.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.280
Must be an earlier recording.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.720
<i>I mean, no, no, we've got</i> <i>to try and do the two things,</i>

43:04.120 --> 43:06.720
<i>I think...</i>

43:06.760 --> 43:08.480
ALAN: <i> Why do we have to</i> <i>always move on?</i>

43:08.520 --> 43:10.680
<i>I think it's important</i> <i>to have the two...</i>

43:10.720 --> 43:13.640
Mmm. Looks like she's got a bit of a fan.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.040
Big smile! <i>-Cheers.</i>

43:17.840 --> 43:19.200
Yes, a very big fan.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.440
Huh.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.480
You were right to be suspicious, Camille.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.520
No wonder Henri wanted his camcorder back in a hurry.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.720
So, the camera belongs to Henri.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.360
Who loves Imke.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.960
Who loves Francis.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.240
Who's dead.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.320
That's very kind of you to bring it.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.240
I could have picked it up at the station.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.720
You shot that footage. Yes?

43:49.760 --> 43:51.840
Without Imke's knowledge, obviously.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.720
Or Francis's.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.920
This isn't how it looks.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.960
Well, it looks like you've been stalking her.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.560
I know...

43:59.600 --> 44:00.920
You're infatuated with a woman

44:00.960 --> 44:02.800
who had a relationship with a man who's now dead.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.120
You wanted him out of the way, so you could move in?

44:09.240 --> 44:12.600
That night was the first I knew about her and Francis.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.640
I found myself outside her place,

44:14.680 --> 44:17.360
camera in hand, thinking, "Henri, what are you doing?

44:17.400 --> 44:19.800
"Do you have any idea how ridiculous this makes you?"

44:22.520 --> 44:24.840
Uh, when I realised that she loved him,

44:24.880 --> 44:26.800
I knew there was no chance for me.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.400
Is this how you behave when you're in love?

44:29.480 --> 44:30.560
Stupid?

44:31.600 --> 44:32.760
I know that now.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.400
I wanted to tell her. I should have told her.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.840
Why didn't you?

44:39.880 --> 44:42.040
She didn't see me in that way.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.000
I guess I knew that all along. But...

44:45.640 --> 44:47.320
You must think me a fool.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.320
Well, yes, well, it's, certainly, um...

44:49.360 --> 44:51.920
An unorthodox method of courtship.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.120
It got out of control.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.920
I became a little obsessed, I admit.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.360
But I didn't kill Francis.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.400
Keeping this.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.200
What did he say?

45:13.240 --> 45:15.160
He admitted he was in love with Imke

45:15.200 --> 45:18.080
but denied any involvement

45:15.200 --> 45:18.080
in Francis's death.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.400
Come on, the answer has to be here somewhere.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.320
Who is our most convincing killer?

45:25.360 --> 45:26.760
Alan!

45:26.800 --> 45:27.880
He'd been ousted from the presidency

45:27.920 --> 45:29.160
and he was under terrible pressure,

45:29.200 --> 45:31.120
because he'd just lost his wife.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.720
Henri. In love with Imke,

45:32.760 --> 45:35.000
knew about her relationship with Francis.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.640
Imke. In love with Francis

45:36.680 --> 45:38.160
but he rejected her.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.640
Ryan. A star student back in the UK,

45:40.680 --> 45:42.240
Dad forces move here,

45:42.280 --> 45:45.360
his grades suffer, he's lonely, thinks his dad

45:42.280 --> 45:45.360
doesn't care.

45:45.400 --> 45:48.320
Teresa. Stole cash and Francis caught her.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.520
Like you said, it could be any of them.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.000
How did the killer make sure that it was Francis that got

45:53.040 --> 45:55.200
the metaphorical silver sixpence

45:55.240 --> 45:57.920
from the metaphorical Christmas pud?

45:59.360 --> 46:00.920
Your pen is leaking.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.080
Hmm?

46:02.120 --> 46:03.440
Oh, yes, so it is.

46:04.200 --> 46:05.880
Thank you.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.720
It's always leaking, this pen! I'll just be a minute

46:05.920 --> 46:08.720
to clean...

46:14.200 --> 46:16.600
Only in the stew, everything else was clear.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.120
TERESA: <i> He was so gentle,</i> <i>so understanding.</i>

46:20.800 --> 46:22.000
It belonged to Francis.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.600
We were following an authentic recipe I found.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.840
Just wanted a dad.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.480
You know who did it, don't you?

46:34.640 --> 46:35.720
Yes, I do.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.560
And how.

46:37.600 --> 46:38.640
And why!

46:40.800 --> 46:42.360
Shall I call all the suspects now

46:42.400 --> 46:44.160
and tell them to meet us at Catherine's bar?

46:45.120 --> 46:46.440
You're a fast learner, Florence.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.000
HUMPHREY: Thank you all for joining us.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.680
Francis's death was designed to look accidental.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.880
An innocent mistake.

47:06.920 --> 47:11.480
A terrible reaction to a poisonous herb

47:06.920 --> 47:11.480
mistakenly added to a stew.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.760
What the killer didn't know was that not an hour

47:11.520 --> 47:14.760
before Francis

47:14.800 --> 47:18.560
tucked into that fateful meal, he called me,

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
saying that he thought someone was trying to kill him.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.520
It was for that reason and that reason alone,

47:24.560 --> 47:28.000
we decided that Francis's death

47:24.560 --> 47:28.000
wasn't an accident at all.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.800
It was murder, plain and simple.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.360
But...

47:35.520 --> 47:37.720
And this is what kept stumping us.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.240
How did the killer manage to deliver a fatal dosage of

47:37.760 --> 47:42.240
the poison to just one person?

47:42.280 --> 47:45.000
I mean, you all ate exactly the same amount of food,

47:45.040 --> 47:46.360
so why did Francis die,

47:48.160 --> 47:49.640
while the rest of you were merely ill?

47:51.920 --> 47:54.160
Apart from you, Alan.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.800
See, by your own admission, your departure

47:54.200 --> 47:56.800
from the Society

47:56.840 --> 47:58.400
had been humiliating.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.520
Your wife was ill and this other man

48:00.400 --> 48:03.520
just swept in,

48:03.560 --> 48:06.440
changed everything and did it without your consultation

48:03.560 --> 48:06.440
or approval.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.840
Like you just didn't matter.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.320
CAMILLE: <i>You, more than anyone else,</i>

48:10.360 --> 48:13.000
<i>had the opportunity to poison</i> <i>the stew unnoticed.</i>

48:13.840 --> 48:15.120
I know how it looks.

48:16.800 --> 48:17.960
But I didn't kill him.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.360
Believe me.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.440
I do.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.920
And, Imke. You loved Francis.

48:28.040 --> 48:30.520
At last, you'd found a man you could rely on.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.680
CAMILLE: <i> It was you</i> <i>who chose the recipe</i>

48:30.560 --> 48:34.680
<i>for the rehearsal dinner.</i>

48:34.720 --> 48:38.360
Maybe you selected it with the sole aim of using it

48:34.720 --> 48:38.360
to poison your ex-lover.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.640
No.

48:40.680 --> 48:43.840
Henri. You also had motive.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.320
<i>You were in love</i> <i>with the woman</i>

48:43.880 --> 48:46.320
<i>Francis was seeing.</i>

48:50.800 --> 48:52.240
I swear to God, I didn't do it.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.000
Ryan, your dad brought you halfway round the world,

48:57.040 --> 49:00.000
away from everything and everyone you'd known.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.320
All you wanted was for him to acknowledge you.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.320
But he didn't. But I genuinely believe

49:03.360 --> 49:06.640
the last thing you wanted was for your dad to die.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.560
Which makes this murder all the more tragic.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.240
Just leaves us with you, Teresa.

49:18.360 --> 49:19.640
You killed Francis Davison.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.480
What?

49:23.920 --> 49:25.880
But that... That's ridiculous!

49:25.920 --> 49:28.920
You see, as Heritage Society Secretary,

49:28.960 --> 49:31.520
you'd been at the heart of organising the events

49:28.960 --> 49:31.520
to celebrate

49:31.560 --> 49:33.800
the first European settlers landing on the island.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.760
And knowing that part of the day's

49:35.360 --> 49:37.760
activities involved

49:37.800 --> 49:41.640
foraging for the ingredients to be used in that

49:37.800 --> 49:41.640
evening's meal,

49:41.680 --> 49:44.480
you realised you could contrive

49:41.680 --> 49:44.480
for Francis's murder

49:44.520 --> 49:47.040
to look like a tragic accident.

49:47.080 --> 49:50.600
Once Imke had found the recipe,

49:47.080 --> 49:50.600
you would be cooking from,

49:50.640 --> 49:53.320
you prepared a fact sheet outlining all the herbs

49:53.360 --> 49:55.360
the Society would be foraging for.

49:55.400 --> 49:59.680
All you then had to do, was find a poisonous plant

49:55.400 --> 49:59.680
similar to any one of them.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.760
As a librarian, I'm sure it wouldn't have been

49:59.720 --> 50:01.760
too hard to find

50:01.800 --> 50:05.200
the necessary botanical books you needed.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.680
<i>Then it was just</i> <i>a quick recce to the beach</i>

50:06.720 --> 50:08.360
<i>where the rehearsal</i> <i>was happening</i>

50:08.400 --> 50:10.640
<i>to make sure that both plants</i> <i>were indeed growing there.</i>

50:10.680 --> 50:13.080
<i>And everything</i> <i>was in its place.</i>

50:14.440 --> 50:15.640
<i>When the day</i> <i>of the rehearsal came,</i>

50:15.680 --> 50:18.360
<i>all you had to do was hand out</i> <i>the fact sheets.</i>

50:18.400 --> 50:21.440
<i>And instead of picking</i> <i>the harmless pound-cake bush,</i>

50:21.480 --> 50:24.920
<i>you knowingly picked</i> <i>the poisonous water hemlock.</i>

50:24.960 --> 50:27.200
<i>You put it</i> <i>with the rest of the herbs</i>

50:24.960 --> 50:27.200
<i>to be used in the stew.</i>

50:28.520 --> 50:30.440
It was then just a matter of sitting back

50:30.480 --> 50:32.280
and letting the poison take its course.

50:33.520 --> 50:35.960
<i>You knew you would</i> <i>have to suffer as well.</i>

50:36.000 --> 50:39.040
<i>But it was a small price</i> <i>to pay to get the result</i>

50:36.000 --> 50:39.040
<i>you wanted.</i>

50:39.800 --> 50:41.480
<i>Francis's death.</i>

50:41.520 --> 50:43.360
Which brings us back to the question,

50:43.400 --> 50:45.520
how did you manage to kill only Francis,

50:45.560 --> 50:48.760
while everyone else, yourself included,

50:45.560 --> 50:48.760
were left just feeling unwell?

50:50.240 --> 50:53.920
Well, it was a leaky pen that solved it for me.

50:57.520 --> 51:01.640
It was then I realised that it wasn't just the stew

50:57.520 --> 51:01.640
that was poisoned.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.640
We'd already checked the other consumables from the beach.

51:04.680 --> 51:07.200
The wine, fruit juice, water.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.440
Not one contained any hint of the poison.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.480
So where was the extra poison secreted?

51:15.560 --> 51:18.480
Part of Francis's presidential duties

51:18.520 --> 51:22.280
was to make a speech on behalf of the Heritage

51:18.520 --> 51:22.280
Society at the re-enactment.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.360
And it seems, Teresa,

51:25.400 --> 51:27.840
that you'd been the one encouraging him

51:25.400 --> 51:27.840
to rehearse it.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.720
You going to give us a little flavour

51:27.880 --> 51:30.720
of your speech?

51:30.760 --> 51:32.000
-Come on! -Oh, go on!

51:32.040 --> 51:33.440
Yeah, come on!

51:33.480 --> 51:36.880
He'd only just finished writing the speech

51:33.480 --> 51:36.880
before dinner.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.800
Writing it in the one thing he took with him everywhere.

51:41.160 --> 51:43.440
His journal.

51:43.480 --> 51:47.760
That's how Francis ended up consuming

51:43.480 --> 51:47.760
more poison than anyone else.

51:47.800 --> 51:51.400
Because the edges of the pages of his journal

51:47.800 --> 51:51.400
that contained his speech

51:51.440 --> 51:55.360
had been saturated with a lethal concentration

51:51.440 --> 51:55.360
of poison.

51:55.400 --> 51:59.200
You knew you only needed tiny amounts of water hemlock

51:59.240 --> 52:01.160
in the stew to make everyone sick.

52:01.200 --> 52:05.840
But to kill, you'd need to administer

52:01.200 --> 52:05.840
a much bigger dose.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.080
HUMPHREY: <i>Having sourced the poisonous</i>

52:05.880 --> 52:08.080
<i>herb a few days earlier,</i>

52:08.120 --> 52:12.240
<i>you then reduced it down</i> <i>to its most toxic and lethal</i>

52:08.120 --> 52:12.240
<i>concentration.</i>

52:12.280 --> 52:14.080
<i>You then contacted Francis,</i> <i>arranging to meet</i>

52:14.120 --> 52:15.840
<i>to talk about</i> <i>your money troubles.</i>

52:15.880 --> 52:18.400
<i>And I assume that when</i> <i>the opportunity</i>

52:15.880 --> 52:18.400
<i>presented itself,</i>

52:18.440 --> 52:20.280
<i>you seized it.</i>

52:20.320 --> 52:22.000
<i>You knew</i> <i>in its concentrated form</i>

52:22.040 --> 52:23.960
<i>it would only take a few licks</i> <i>of poison to kill him.</i>

52:28.880 --> 52:31.240
See, you knew Francis's habit.

52:31.280 --> 52:34.600
Knew he'd need his journal, how much he relied on it.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.640
And as he licked his fingers to turn the page,

52:38.360 --> 52:39.760
his fate was sealed.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.160
MAN: <i> Francis!</i>

52:48.880 --> 52:51.320
See, the answer was in the journal, after all.

52:51.360 --> 52:54.640
You popped the silver sixpence in his mouth. You killed him.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.240
I've no idea what you're talking about.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.880
Why would I do that?

52:59.920 --> 53:02.120
Because you'd spent the best part of the last 35 years

53:02.160 --> 53:04.120
looking after your father and when he died,

53:05.920 --> 53:07.120
apart from a dwindling inheritance,

53:07.160 --> 53:08.560
you found yourself with nothing.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.760
No husband. No children.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.280
You took what little cash you had left

53:13.320 --> 53:15.440
and you came out here to start again.

53:15.480 --> 53:18.200
You joined the Heritage Society

53:15.480 --> 53:18.200
to find friendship

53:18.240 --> 53:20.080
and you found the family you'd never had.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.480
And the child you'd never had.

53:22.840 --> 53:24.720
You killed Francis

53:24.760 --> 53:27.320
because you were about to lose the one person

53:24.760 --> 53:27.320
that mattered the most to you.

53:28.960 --> 53:30.520
You were about to lose Ryan. It's nonsense.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.320
You saw how unhappy he was on Saint Marie.

53:36.360 --> 53:38.160
Miles from home. No friends.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.280
<i>His father not giving him</i> <i>any time or attention.</i>

53:41.120 --> 53:43.400
<i>But you did, didn't you?</i>

53:43.440 --> 53:46.560
You loved him as though he were your own son.

53:46.600 --> 53:49.000
And since Francis died, you've been constantly

53:46.600 --> 53:49.000
by his side.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.320
Wherever Ryan goes, you go.

53:52.360 --> 53:55.400
So when Francis found out about your misuse

53:52.360 --> 53:55.400
of Society funds

53:55.440 --> 53:56.640
and told you to leave,

53:56.680 --> 53:58.440
you realised you were about to lose everything

53:59.280 --> 54:00.640
and most of all, Ryan.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.600
For the first time, your life had a purpose,

54:04.640 --> 54:06.880
you'd become a mother by default.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.680
If Francis had lost all trust in you,

54:08.720 --> 54:10.480
why would he allow you anywhere near Ryan?

54:12.640 --> 54:14.840
You'd lose your son.

54:14.880 --> 54:17.120
You couldn't let that happen. Wouldn't.

54:17.160 --> 54:18.960
Your love for Ryan was so strong,

54:20.440 --> 54:22.440
you were willing to kill to keep him.

54:24.880 --> 54:27.320
So Francis had to die.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.440
You deserved so much better.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.840
You deserved to be loved.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.360
Sweetheart...

54:35.400 --> 54:36.480
Take her away.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.680
Please!

55:01.200 --> 55:03.320
It's a sorry affair, if you ask me, Chief.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.960
Yes, it is. A boy's lost his father.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.280
But I can't help but feel some pity for Teresa.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.240
Thank you for all your hard work,

55:10.480 --> 55:12.240
everyone.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.520
We did a good job.

55:15.760 --> 55:17.240
Well. Night, sir. HUMPHREY:

55:17.280 --> 55:18.760
Night, Florence. Dwayne.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.320
Uh, sir.

55:26.520 --> 55:27.840
I wanted to apologise.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.400
No, I should be apologising. I threw you in the sea.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.680
Yes, but, um,

55:32.720 --> 55:35.200
the way I spoke to you was entirely wrong.

55:35.240 --> 55:36.440
You're my superior officer.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.280
And a friend.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.760
And as a friend, there's something

55:41.560 --> 55:44.760
I need to tell you.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.320
-Things have been... -I'm sorry, I...

55:47.360 --> 55:49.360
Okay, you first. -No, please.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.320
Right.

55:54.360 --> 55:57.600
For the past few days, your attitude, your behaviour.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.560
You've been a little odd.

56:01.160 --> 56:03.000
Odd?

56:03.040 --> 56:06.360
Maybe the wrong word. Um, distracted.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.240
Preoccupied. Like you have something on your mind.

56:11.720 --> 56:12.960
You're right. I have.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.040
Something I've been wanting to talk to you...

56:16.080 --> 56:17.720
Yeah. Which was annoying me.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.440
And then I realised why.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.240
I was feeling the same.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.480
Yes?

56:27.520 --> 56:30.520
Yeah. I think, to be fair,

56:31.520 --> 56:33.040
you've probably picked up on it.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.160
Felt the vibes.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.680
In my head, I've talked this through a million times

56:42.720 --> 56:45.240
and it's never come out right, so I'm just going to say it...

56:45.280 --> 56:47.400
No, no, no, no, I need to go first

56:45.280 --> 56:47.400
or I'll burst.

56:48.880 --> 56:49.920
I...

56:52.600 --> 56:55.200
I've been offered a job in Paris.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.960
One of the inspectors flew in a few days back

56:58.000 --> 57:01.280
and I had dinner with him a couple of times

56:58.000 --> 57:01.280
to discuss the offer.

57:01.320 --> 57:03.600
I'd be going back to my roots,

57:03.640 --> 57:04.840
undercover work.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.560
They approached me.

57:06.600 --> 57:10.680
It's a bit of a shock but it's a once-in-a-lifetime

57:06.600 --> 57:10.680
opportunity.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.440
I haven't said yes yet. I need to think about it.

57:15.880 --> 57:17.440
But say you're pleased for me?

57:18.120 --> 57:19.360
Please.

57:21.600 --> 57:22.920
I'm delighted.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.600
-Really, really,

57:22.960 --> 57:24.600
really delighted.

57:25.760 --> 57:26.960
It...

57:28.040 --> 57:30.640
Such an exciting change you need.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.880
-Yes. -Yeah.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.720
You know... You know what,

57:32.920 --> 57:34.720
we should celebrate.

57:34.760 --> 57:36.400
-This is a champagne occasion!

57:37.440 --> 57:39.000
Champagne at your mother's bar!

57:39.040 --> 57:41.480
Okay. Well, I need to freshen up first

57:41.520 --> 57:43.360
but I'll meet you at the bar.

57:43.760 --> 57:44.760
Mmm-hmm.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.600
Thank you for being so understanding.

57:49.520 --> 57:50.600
I'll meet you there.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.480
Yes, see you there.

58:10.400 --> 58:13.040
I've got the best bridesmaids ever.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.120
Jenny!

58:14.160 --> 58:15.280
Stop! That's it!

58:16.680 --> 58:18.840
How can I go to Paris? You wouldn't survive a week.

58:18.880 --> 58:21.200
Dwayne, how do you know so much about handles?

58:21.240 --> 58:24.120
A great magician never reveals his secrets.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.800
She can't go unless we agree to the transfer.

58:26.840 --> 58:27.920
She'd hate me.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.760
It would be in complete confidence.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.080
I think it's time I was honest with you.
