What's for b-fast, Jake?

00:48.423 --> 00:50.175
Everything burrito.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.395
I love you, everything burrito.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.406
Aw, man.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.905
I think someone wants to
eat Everything Burrito.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.225
I won't let them get you, baby!

01:09.987 --> 01:10.988
Jake, come on!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.118
Get ready!

01:12.197 --> 01:13.665
Ready!

01:13.740 --> 01:15.367
Yaah!

01:16.618 --> 01:17.414
Peep.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.416
So cute!

01:18.495 --> 01:20.247
Look at their little faces!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.129
We're not cute. We're evil!

01:23.208 --> 01:25.085
And we're here to dominate <i>you!</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:26.966
Get the camera, Jake.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.171
I can't.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.098
I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!

01:30.173 --> 01:31.846
Beemo! Beemo! Beemo!

01:31.925 --> 01:32.767
Beemo!

01:32.843 --> 01:34.561
What? What? What? What?

01:34.636 --> 01:35.979
Beemo, get the camera!

01:36.054 --> 01:38.056
Beemo is camera.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.613
Enough!

01:45.689 --> 01:46.815
Now...

01:46.898 --> 01:52.155
Bow down to me, Cute King,
and my legion of cuties!

01:53.905 --> 01:55.657
Great shot, Beemo!

01:55.741 --> 02:00.463
Since you won't take us
seriously, we will kill you!

02:00.537 --> 02:04.758
Until then, enjoy
your burrito, Jake.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.130
Huh?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.016
My burrito!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.889
It's perfectly fine!

02:14.968 --> 02:16.220
No, Finn.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.976
They probably poisoned it!

02:18.055 --> 02:19.147
Naaaw.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.895
They knew my name.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.772
They knew about the burrito.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.025
Man, you're letting your brain
dial turn your fear volume up.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.447
You'll see.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.866
Those cuties are nothin' but
an afternoon's delight.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.372
Jake? What are you
doing in my bed?

02:43.455 --> 02:46.800
Oh, nothin' much, you
know, just chillin'.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.252
Wait a second.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.305
Are you still messed up
about those little guys?

02:51.380 --> 02:52.677
A little.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.680
Look, man, what do you say
tomorrow morning we go track

02:55.759 --> 02:58.478
those little guys down and find
out just what their deal is?

02:58.553 --> 02:59.395
Sound good, buddy?

02:59.471 --> 03:00.471
Yeah.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.939
Thanks, buddy.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.065
Man, you sound just
like mom sometimes.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.521
Yeah. Good old mom.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.777
She always knew
just what to say.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.028
Yeah.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.576
Good night, brotha.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.244
Good night.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.573
Finn! Finn!

03:17.656 --> 03:18.748
Finn, wake up, man!

03:18.824 --> 03:19.871
Wha?! Huh?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.248
I think someone's in the house.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.789
For real, man!

03:25.872 --> 03:29.672
Shh. Listen.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.627
Uh...

03:30.711 --> 03:32.008
I swear, man.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.384
I really heard something.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.303
Finn!

03:35.382 --> 03:36.508
I heard.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.060
Okay. Who's out there?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.567
What the?!

03:45.642 --> 03:47.144
That's my sword!

03:47.227 --> 03:49.696
What do they want
with my sword, man?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.951
It came from downstairs!

03:54.025 --> 03:56.244
All right. That's it.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.912
Where are you going?

03:57.988 --> 04:01.834
I'm gonna go manhandle
those guys' banandles.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.582
What?

04:04.661 --> 04:08.757
Well, they broke a window,
but I don't see any of 'em.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.300
I guess they left.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.627
Oh, no!

04:11.710 --> 04:12.710
Oh, oh, no!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.721
Jake, what is it?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.798
Oh, no!

04:16.882 --> 04:18.600
It's a dead goat, man!

04:18.675 --> 04:21.019
Its guts are all over the place!

04:21.094 --> 04:24.314
It's all chopped up and
spread around and...

04:24.389 --> 04:25.265
Oh, no, wait.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.348
It's just a blanket.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.189
I think I left it
here this morning.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.896
Jake! Finn!

04:30.979 --> 04:33.949
This is the voice of your mom!

04:34.024 --> 04:38.530
I've come back to tell you
how dumb you always are!

04:38.612 --> 04:43.334
I hate you guys so much!

04:43.408 --> 04:44.910
Oh!

04:44.993 --> 04:45.869
Get him, Jake!

04:45.952 --> 04:47.625
Aah! Aah!

04:48.997 --> 04:50.044
Blauwgh!

04:53.919 --> 04:55.796
Jake, I got him!

04:55.879 --> 04:57.506
He's freakin' out, man!

04:57.589 --> 04:59.011
- What do I do?!
- Shake him!

04:59.090 --> 05:00.012
What?!

05:00.091 --> 05:01.843
Shake him around till he stops!

05:01.927 --> 05:02.927
Okay-

05:07.015 --> 05:08.016
They stopped.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.271
Okay-

05:09.351 --> 05:11.353
Now tell 'em not to
talk about our mom.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.905
How do you even
know about our mom?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.402
We've been watching you.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.200
Learning your weaknesses.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.572
What?! Why?!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.325
For tomorrow morning.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.907
When our army comes
and kills you both.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.333
You think we're so cute,

05:25.408 --> 05:27.911
when actually we're
the opposite of that!

05:28.912 --> 05:29.708
Waah!

05:29.788 --> 05:31.040
Hold him!

05:38.046 --> 05:39.093
Oh, gross!

05:39.172 --> 05:40.094
Well?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.050
Do you believe me now, Finn?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.259
I...

05:43.343 --> 05:45.516
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.847
Well, that's close enough.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.773
Let's start settin'
up some barricades.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.116
There's got to be
a thousand of em!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.163
Wait. Jake, look!

06:20.005 --> 06:21.928
These guys aren't a
threat to anyone.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.385
These guys are a
threat to themselves.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.682
Ow!

06:27.804 --> 06:29.272
Oh, hey, it's what's his face.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.725
No! My men!

06:31.808 --> 06:32.900
Quickly, men!

06:32.976 --> 06:35.274
Pick yourselves up
before the enemy sees!

06:35.353 --> 06:37.447
Come on, now.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.569
That's it.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.865
Easy does it.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.941
Ow.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.995
Bravest warriors, I ask you,

06:47.073 --> 06:51.544
must we have our butts handed
to us by everyone we meet?!

06:51.620 --> 06:54.749
How will we ever splash around
in the brains of our enemies if

06:54.831 --> 06:58.711
you guys can't take two
steps without exploding?!

06:58.793 --> 07:00.420
Bliblob, I'm lookin' at you!

07:02.172 --> 07:07.474
Can I <i>please</i> just get one victory...
once?!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.682
Now, don't start that!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.312
Don't you do it!

07:22.692 --> 07:24.035
You want to just smash 'em all?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.157
What?!

07:25.236 --> 07:26.909
No, man, look, these guys aren't

07:26.988 --> 07:28.581
gonna quit until
they win or die.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.954
And they're not gonna win.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.660
So what if we let 'em win?

07:31.743 --> 07:32.744
Just this once?

07:32.827 --> 07:33.827
What?!

07:33.870 --> 07:35.087
<i>And mess up my stats?!</i>

07:35.163 --> 07:38.337
No, we'd be winning by
helping them to win.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.416
That's a win.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.800
And then they'll be happy
and leave us alone.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.677
All right.

07:44.756 --> 07:45.973
Yesss!

07:46.049 --> 07:48.893
Now let's rally an army so
we can look intimidating!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.016
Who are we gonna call?

07:50.095 --> 07:52.348
All of our friends.

07:54.099 --> 07:57.979
My army of friends, today
we will lose this battle.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.234
But we will also win it!

08:02.148 --> 08:05.652
When the enemy charges,
crumble like a cookie.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.954
When you feel their
puny punches,

08:08.029 --> 08:13.286
fade like a flower and
writhe in your own blood!

08:13.368 --> 08:17.373
But... but... how are we to
bleed if none of this is real?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.128
With faith, Milady.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.379
And ketchup.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.128
Ketchup is delicious
and deceiving!

08:23.211 --> 08:26.681
And, hey, guys, let's
keep the acting subtle.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.848
Less is more!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.346
No way.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.786
First, I'm gonna fall in love
with one of those little guys.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.268
And then I'm gonna
fall out of love.

08:34.347 --> 08:39.352
And then I'm gonna totally fake
die of a fake heart attack!

08:39.436 --> 08:41.279
Oh! My heart!

08:41.354 --> 08:46.406
My heart hurts because
I fell out of love!

08:46.484 --> 08:48.361
And now I have to die!

08:48.445 --> 08:50.994
Ohhhhhhh!

08:55.744 --> 08:57.087
Get ready, y'all.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.415
Together, we fall!

08:59.497 --> 09:00.419
Unh!

09:00.498 --> 09:01.750
Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!

09:09.257 --> 09:10.600
Yaah!

09:10.675 --> 09:12.143
Whoa!

09:15.805 --> 09:20.106
Oh, no! My bloooood!

09:20.185 --> 09:21.903
Whooooa!

09:23.688 --> 09:26.612
Hey!

09:26.691 --> 09:30.366
One last kiss before
dying, my love.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.077
Farewell forever!

09:33.156 --> 09:34.954
Oh! Oh, my heart!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.660
Aah!

09:36.743 --> 09:38.165
I'm dead!

09:38.244 --> 09:41.919
Victory is ours!

09:42.916 --> 09:44.213
Finally...

09:44.292 --> 09:46.215

No!

10:04.312 --> 10:07.737
This is ketchup?!

10:07.816 --> 10:08.988
It tastes better than blood.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.284
Or does it?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.505
Hey, Finn, you think blood
tastes better than ketchup'?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.406
Jake, look.

Aw, nuts.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.503
It doesn't matter now.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.884
No one will ever
fear our strength.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.591
But strength isn't
your strength.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.551
Adorable cuteness is!

Can I use it to control others?

Yeah, sure!
