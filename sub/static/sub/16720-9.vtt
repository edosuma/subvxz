Are they the cutest couple
on TV or what, Gene?

00:38.449 --> 00:40.204
Yeah, if you like white people.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.724
Now look away, Mom.

00:41.754 --> 00:44.037
What? Why?
Dad's hogging the bathroom

00:44.067 --> 00:46.599
so I'm using the guest bathroom!
Ugh, Gene.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.283
Come on, you've let me
do it before!

00:48.313 --> 00:49.697
Fine. But move the dishes.

Aw, Gene!
That's my spot!

That's funny.
It smells like my spot.

We want to talk to you.

Also, want to be part of
our new cooking segment?

If you're a local chef,
send us a tape!

(GASPS) Oh, my God... B-Bob!

01:09.214 --> 01:11.267
Get in here!
What? What is it?

01:11.297 --> 01:12.671
You got to make an audition tape

01:12.701 --> 01:14.654
to do a cooking segment
for <i>Get On Up!</i>

01:14.684 --> 01:16.521
Oh, no. I don't...
I don't think so.

01:16.551 --> 01:18.206
Oh, come on, Bob.
You'd be great!

01:18.236 --> 01:20.024
No, no, that's...
that's not for me.

01:20.054 --> 01:22.535
I mean, sure, it'd be fun
to be a celebrity chef, but...

01:22.565 --> 01:24.039
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. What?

01:24.069 --> 01:26.671
When did a cooking segment turn
into being a celebrity chef?

01:26.712 --> 01:28.020
That's not what I meant.

01:28.050 --> 01:29.625
I meant cooking segment.
Forget it.

01:29.655 --> 01:32.133

01:32.163 --> 01:34.106
Stop it. Go to school. Fine!

01:34.136 --> 01:36.714
As long as we're giving orders,
put some clothes on!

01:36.744 --> 01:39.246
Leave something to the
imagination, for God's sakes!

01:46.759 --> 01:49.872
Is no one going to comment
on my Sasquatch mask?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.276
Middle child.

01:51.306 --> 01:52.966
Anything for attention.

01:52.996 --> 01:55.088
Where'd you get the mask from? No.
No. No!

01:55.118 --> 01:56.475
Thanks for asking.
Peter Pescadero.

01:56.505 --> 01:57.847
He said he'd give it to me

01:57.877 --> 01:59.275
if I taught him
how to pop and lock.

01:59.305 --> 02:01.158
Lucy Lock-it lost her Pop-it.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.530
Now you.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.054
Lucy Lock-it lost her...

02:05.084 --> 02:07.394
What kind of a god
would give you those legs

02:07.424 --> 02:09.183
and no rhythm?!

02:09.213 --> 02:11.725
This mask is gonna
make me the new "it" kid.

02:11.755 --> 02:13.062
As in, "What is it?"

02:13.092 --> 02:14.450

Hello, Gene.
You look intriguing today, son.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.511
Why, thank you, Mother!

02:34.995 --> 02:37.172
Okay. So, uh, I am preparing

02:37.202 --> 02:39.848
the Onion-tended
Consequences burger.

02:39.878 --> 02:43.057
Now, first you have
to caramelise the onions.

02:43.087 --> 02:44.854
And no, I don't mean add caramel.

02:44.926 --> 02:46.602
Ha!
Heh.

02:46.632 --> 02:48.876
Then you add some fresh thyme,
which I have right here.

02:48.906 --> 02:52.219
Then it's time to add
the goat cheese.

02:52.249 --> 02:53.892
And voilÃ Â¡.

Take what off?
This is me now!

03:05.575 --> 03:06.749
Heard that before.

03:06.779 --> 03:08.187
This is me now!

03:24.886 --> 03:26.127
Ohh!
Bring the whole family?

03:26.157 --> 03:27.274
Woo!
Um, sure.

03:27.344 --> 03:28.853

03:36.306 --> 03:38.149

I mean, it's um, you know,

03:38.179 --> 03:39.753
it's gonna be good
for the restaurant.

03:39.783 --> 03:41.592
Yeah.
That's the important thing.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.048
But we can still jump up and down!

03:44.465 --> 03:45.973
Oh, my God. Woo! Yay.

Hi, you must be Bob.
I'm Kevin.

03:57.289 --> 03:58.898
Let's introduce you
to Chuck and Pam.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.485
Don't ask them
any questions, obviously.

04:00.515 --> 04:01.899
And don't touch them,

04:01.970 --> 04:03.712
but also don't make
too much eye contact.

04:03.742 --> 04:06.060
Everybody's friendly...

04:06.133 --> 04:07.508
Bob!

04:07.538 --> 04:08.739
We just loved your tape.

04:08.808 --> 04:10.735
Well, some of us did.

04:10.765 --> 04:12.190
Oh, hello.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.296
Are you a little bunny?

04:17.101 --> 04:18.877
Okay. I don't like that one.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.214
So, Bob, you'll stand over here,

04:20.245 --> 04:22.221
and then we'll put Gene here.

04:22.251 --> 04:24.147
Huh? What? CHUCK: Yeah.
Exactly like in the tape.

04:24.177 --> 04:25.734
I knew it! I mean,
I had no idea, but...

04:25.764 --> 04:27.463
yes!
No, no, no, no, no.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.974
It's great. It's like when they
got a chimp on <i>The Today Show.</i>

04:30.004 --> 04:31.317
Yeah, that was in the '50s,

04:31.347 --> 04:33.282
but sure, let's base all
our decisions on that.

04:33.319 --> 04:35.229
I think it could go viral!

04:35.259 --> 04:36.934

04:36.964 --> 04:40.412

you, Pam, but that is certainly</i>

footage I've ever seen.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.013
Oh.

04:46.043 --> 04:48.555
So I'll do all the talking
and you just nod, all right?

04:48.585 --> 04:49.892
Yes. Check.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.999
And entertain the crap
out of everybody.

04:52.029 --> 04:54.406
No, no, no, not that. Okay, just...
Blow their minds. Got it.

04:54.436 --> 04:56.345
Gene, stop it. Don't do that.
I got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.133
Okay, and now it is time
for our new segment,

04:58.163 --> 04:59.723
"Hey, Good Cookin'."

04:59.753 --> 05:02.833
And today's chef is
Bob of Bob's Burgers.

05:02.863 --> 05:04.271
And who is this furry fella?

05:04.301 --> 05:06.579
I'm... the Sasquatch Kid!

05:06.609 --> 05:08.150
No wait, Burgerfoot!

05:08.180 --> 05:11.115
No, Beefsquatch!

05:13.129 --> 05:14.972
Right. Um...

05:15.002 --> 05:16.944
And today, uh...

05:16.974 --> 05:19.085
we're making the
Bruschetta Bout It Burger.

05:19.115 --> 05:20.874
So we start with some
fresh mozzarella,

05:20.904 --> 05:22.227
and some basil...

05:22.257 --> 05:24.000
Mm, mm, mm.
Gene. Stop it.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.885
Pop-it-lock-it-pop-it-lock-it.
And then we, uh,

05:25.915 --> 05:27.513
add some oil and vinegar
to these, and...

05:27.543 --> 05:28.715
I want beef!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.646
Oh.

05:46.351 --> 05:49.937
Oh, boy.
Beefsquatch!

05:52.454 --> 05:55.130
So they want Bob and Gene
back next week.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.437
They said it got the most
response of any segment

05:57.467 --> 05:59.310
since they showed Pam
getting her tubes tied.

05:59.340 --> 06:01.603
The fallopians on that woman!
Eh...

06:01.647 --> 06:03.255
Bob, you excited or what?

06:03.285 --> 06:05.362
Bobby?
No, Teddy. I'm not.

06:05.392 --> 06:07.469
Why not?
He's just mad 'cause he thinks Gene

06:07.499 --> 06:09.308
Beefsquatched all over
his special moment.

06:09.338 --> 06:11.181
Don't, Lin. Don't use
that as a verb.

06:11.211 --> 06:13.187
It's just... it's not
what I envisioned, Teddy.

06:13.217 --> 06:14.437
'Cause it was horrible.

06:14.488 --> 06:16.330
It was great!

06:16.360 --> 06:18.203
I knew this mask was powerful!

06:18.233 --> 06:20.142
So, who wants to touch
and/or be touched

06:20.172 --> 06:21.848
by a famous person?

06:21.878 --> 06:24.205
Can I please have my mask back? No!

06:24.235 --> 06:26.412
I explicitly said
no backsies, Peter.

06:26.442 --> 06:28.803
In this country,
no backsies means something!

06:28.833 --> 06:30.283
Now go pop and lock!

06:30.354 --> 06:31.711
But I don't want to do it anymore.

06:31.741 --> 06:32.659
Go!

06:41.741 --> 06:43.148
BOB: Gene. Hmm?

06:43.178 --> 06:45.489
I need you to do something
for me. It's... It's important.

06:45.519 --> 06:47.958
I'm not pulling out your long
eyebrow hairs again, Dad.

06:48.027 --> 06:50.037
No, it's not...
Wait, are they back?

06:50.067 --> 06:51.708
Oh, yeah.
Yeesh, that is bad.

06:51.738 --> 06:53.114
Anyway, I was thinking maybe, um,

06:53.144 --> 06:54.982
could you, uh, tone it down
out there a little?

06:55.012 --> 06:57.226
Like, uh, let me
explain the recipe?

06:57.256 --> 06:58.831
Try to entertain 'em a little?

06:58.861 --> 07:01.172
Sounds crazy,
but you got it, Dad. Great.

07:01.202 --> 07:03.446
I'll just wait for you to
succeed or fail. Thanks.

07:03.476 --> 07:05.764
Could go great, could be
a disaster... Okay. I got it.

07:05.817 --> 07:08.135
Psst. <i>Psst.</i>

07:08.207 --> 07:10.167
Hi.
Hi.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.474
My mom lets me come
to all the show tapings,

07:12.504 --> 07:14.548
as long as it doesn't interfere
with school work.

07:14.578 --> 07:16.620
It does.
Okay.

07:16.650 --> 07:17.958
You're a VIP, right?

07:17.988 --> 07:19.514
Did you get to meet Pam?

07:19.544 --> 07:21.453
Who, the host lady? Yeah.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.242
(MOANING)

07:23.272 --> 07:25.198
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

07:25.228 --> 07:26.636
So did you, like, I don't know,

07:26.666 --> 07:28.140
taste her hair or anything?

07:28.170 --> 07:29.579
No. I didn't think of that.

07:29.609 --> 07:31.117
I guess I could have.

07:31.147 --> 07:32.471
(MOANING)

07:32.501 --> 07:33.992

her hair all around.

we have some feta cheese...

Yum.

were freshly laid

07:50.859 --> 07:52.769
Anyway, so with these...

07:52.799 --> 07:54.356
Uh, Pam, why don't you
give the audience

07:54.386 --> 07:56.832
a chance to get the joke.
Chickenplant.

07:56.862 --> 07:58.420
(LAUGHS POLITELY) (CLEARS THROAT)

07:58.450 --> 08:00.962
(HUMS)

08:00.992 --> 08:03.209
Oop, I think this one's
hatching right now.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.295
(HUMS NERVOUSLY)

08:06.325 --> 08:07.725
I'll save you, boring cook!

08:08.615 --> 08:10.859
(LAUGHING)

08:10.889 --> 08:12.080
Beefsquatch!

08:12.110 --> 08:13.811
(LAUGHS)

08:15.186 --> 08:18.032
Okay, okay, that'll be $5.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.020
Throw in another five
and he'll burp in your face.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.744
Wow! Look at all these people

08:21.774 --> 08:23.984
that came 'cause of the show,
Bobby! Uh-huh.

08:24.014 --> 08:25.756
Oh, my God, it's great
for the restaurant,

08:25.786 --> 08:27.495
just like you wanted!

08:27.525 --> 08:29.393
Yeah, it's all just how
I wanted it. Mm-hmm.

08:31.037 --> 08:32.779
Hey. Nice dish tub.

08:32.808 --> 08:34.417
Thanks.
You want to go out?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.457
Wow, you must really
like dish tubs.

08:36.486 --> 08:38.155
Are you that boy from
the studio audience?

08:38.225 --> 08:39.851
Shh-shh-shh.

08:39.881 --> 08:41.679
Look, there's something here.
We both know it.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.126
Let's just take it and run with it.

08:43.158 --> 08:45.288
Um... Okay.
Could be worse.

08:45.332 --> 08:46.572
"Could be worse."

08:46.602 --> 08:48.444
(FAKE LAUGH)

08:48.474 --> 08:50.551
Guess who's gonna get
an arm put around them? Me?

08:50.581 --> 08:52.686
(BOTH LAUGH AWKWARDLY)

08:52.755 --> 08:54.714
Can I get your autograph?

08:54.744 --> 08:56.370
There you go, Toots.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.125
Beefsquatch signed it.
Oh, my God!

08:58.155 --> 08:59.982
I'll sign it.
Ow!

09:00.012 --> 09:02.717
"Keep sizzling. Bob."

09:02.753 --> 09:04.212
There you go.

09:04.242 --> 09:05.515
Who are you?
Who are <i>you,</i> huh?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.090
Old man freak.
You idiot kid.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.804
LINDA: <i>Oh, my God, I can't believe</i>

09:09.876 --> 09:11.384
we were invited to
Chuck's pool party.

09:11.414 --> 09:12.688
(LAUGHS)

09:12.718 --> 09:14.310
It'll be swarming with celebrities!

09:14.340 --> 09:16.734
Remember, they're just normal
people like you and me.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.760
Oh, my God, it's local
weatherman Scott Bags!

09:19.790 --> 09:22.041
Scott! Say "cold front!"
Say "cold front!"

09:22.114 --> 09:24.124
Linda. Stop it.
Cold front!

09:24.154 --> 09:25.562
What? He's the weatherman!

09:25.592 --> 09:26.749
Last one in the pool is Tina!

09:26.779 --> 09:28.454
Ah!

09:28.484 --> 09:30.244
Hey... Oh.

09:30.274 --> 09:31.916
Hey, hey!
You guys made it!

09:31.946 --> 09:34.207
Come on, Linda.
Let's get tanked! Yeah.

09:34.237 --> 09:36.363
Uh, thanks for, uh,
inviting us, Chuck.

09:36.393 --> 09:37.784
You're in the inner circle, Bob.

09:37.814 --> 09:40.226
Think of us as your family now.
Okay.

09:40.256 --> 09:42.733
So, you and Linda swing?
Uh, no.

09:42.763 --> 09:44.689
(CHUCKLING): Okay.
I'll take that as a yes.

09:44.719 --> 09:45.876
Wink.
No, I...

09:45.906 --> 09:47.147
Steve's wife! You likey?

09:47.177 --> 09:48.417
Um.
No? Why not?

09:48.447 --> 09:49.622
Body? Face?
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:49.652 --> 09:50.976
Both. Okay.

09:51.006 --> 09:53.150
Hey, Steve, you likey?
Um, Chuck...

09:53.180 --> 09:55.691
Hey, be open to it. Be open to it.
I really don't think this...

09:55.721 --> 09:57.330
I thought I told you
you were in the inner circle.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.951
Right. And the only
rule in the inner circle

09:58.981 --> 10:00.756
is that you're open to it,
so if Steve's in...

10:00.786 --> 10:02.624
Oop, Steve's not interested
anyway, never mind.

10:02.654 --> 10:03.733
We're divorced, you know.

10:03.763 --> 10:05.572
What?
Mm-hmm.

10:05.602 --> 10:07.880
(GASPS) Oh, my God, you're divor...
I can't believe that.

10:07.910 --> 10:10.187
Yeah, we are.
You two look so happy on TV.

10:10.217 --> 10:11.525
Ugh.
What happened?

10:11.555 --> 10:12.955
Fame!
No.

10:13.026 --> 10:13.892
Yes.
No.

10:13.962 --> 10:15.963
Yes.
Fame's great, I thought.

10:16.035 --> 10:18.430
Fame tears families apart.
No.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.603
What?
That, and the fact that

10:20.633 --> 10:23.211
I refuse to live in a house
with low-flush toilets.

10:23.241 --> 10:25.619
I deserve the full flush, Linda.

10:25.649 --> 10:27.659
Of course you do, honey.

10:27.689 --> 10:29.064
Thank you.
Yeah.

10:29.094 --> 10:31.136
(TOILET FLUSHES)

10:31.166 --> 10:32.239
BOB: Damn it.

10:32.269 --> 10:34.146
(FLUSHES AGAIN)

10:34.176 --> 10:36.570
Stupid toilet.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.576
I'm Bob from Bob's Burgers.

10:38.606 --> 10:40.834
Eggplants come from chickenplants.

10:40.864 --> 10:43.048
(LAUGHS AS BEEFSQUATCH)

10:43.121 --> 10:44.227
Hilarious!
That's so Bob!

10:44.257 --> 10:45.800
Nailed it, Beefsquatch!

10:45.830 --> 10:47.772
Hey. Are you making fun of me? No.

10:47.802 --> 10:49.779
No, Dad. No.

10:49.809 --> 10:52.287
That mask has turned you
into a real jerk, Gene!

10:52.317 --> 10:55.072
I think you mean megastar.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.522
Oh, my God, they're making a scene.

10:56.552 --> 10:57.804
You two stop it!

10:57.834 --> 10:59.477
No. Let them fight.

10:59.507 --> 11:01.399
Everybody look that way.

11:01.429 --> 11:02.600
There she goes.
(VOMITING)

11:02.666 --> 11:04.475
Maybe I should just quit.

11:04.505 --> 11:06.816
Do it! Leave the entertaining
to the pros... meaning me

11:06.846 --> 11:08.621
and other people with masks!

11:08.651 --> 11:10.127
No, you know what?

11:10.157 --> 11:12.919
It's time for you
to learn a lesson.

11:12.949 --> 11:14.357
Watch your back, Beefsquatch.

11:14.387 --> 11:16.229
Why don't you watch it for me?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.403
'Cause I'll be shaking it
right in your face!

11:18.433 --> 11:19.767
And it'll look like this!

11:19.837 --> 11:21.705
Ba-baba-Bo-Bo-eh-eh...

11:21.777 --> 11:24.672
(LAUGHS)

11:24.702 --> 11:26.077
It's not funny, Chuck!

11:26.107 --> 11:27.774
It's pretty funny!

11:31.779 --> 11:34.781
I'm gonna make this show
a living nightmare for you.

11:34.813 --> 11:36.347
You're gonna wish
you'd never been born,

11:36.377 --> 11:38.211
meaning I wouldn't be born!

11:38.300 --> 11:40.528
What can I get my favourite
father-son team?

11:40.558 --> 11:41.864
Separate dressing rooms.
Separate dressing rooms.

11:41.894 --> 11:44.055
And a piÃ±ata and large
satin pillows. Now!

11:44.085 --> 11:45.559
And Greek yoghurt.

11:45.589 --> 11:47.015
Two-percent for me.

11:47.045 --> 11:49.329
Just the plain is fine
for both of us!

11:49.402 --> 11:52.464
Louise! Psst! Come here!

11:52.494 --> 11:53.851
I'm trying to sabotage Beefsquatch

11:53.881 --> 11:54.949
and I need your help.

11:55.020 --> 11:56.654
Well, first of all,
I'm flattered...

11:56.725 --> 11:59.084
Shush. Is there anything I can
do to throw him off his game?

11:59.114 --> 12:00.339
Dynamite in the burger.

12:00.369 --> 12:01.310
More subtle.

12:01.340 --> 12:02.580
C4.
Move off explosives.

12:02.610 --> 12:04.126
Habanero peppers.
A lot of them.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.256
Yes! You're a genius!

12:05.319 --> 12:06.093
Oh, stop.

12:06.155 --> 12:07.496
Get me habanero peppers!

12:07.526 --> 12:09.000
I'll call my guy.
Ring, ring.

12:09.030 --> 12:10.539
Let me talk to him.

12:10.569 --> 12:12.478
That's a fake phone.
I don't care.

12:12.508 --> 12:14.401
What's your name?
I don't speak Spanish.

12:14.431 --> 12:18.146
I do. <i>Hola, combre Se hombre,</i>
habanero pepper.

12:18.176 --> 12:21.189
Caw, caw, caw!

12:21.219 --> 12:23.647
Caw! I get it.
I'm in your dressing room.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.369
Oh. Listen, I need you

12:25.399 --> 12:27.967
to help me sabotage Dad
on the show. What a day!

12:28.040 --> 12:30.953
I was thinking, what if I
mislabelled Dad's utensils?

12:30.983 --> 12:32.959
Write, like, "eggbeater"
on the spatula,

12:32.989 --> 12:34.940
and "oven" on the cutting board.
Hmm?

12:35.013 --> 12:37.139
Or what if you put superglue
on them?

12:37.169 --> 12:38.510
Yes! But can you do it?

12:38.540 --> 12:40.416
The last time I used superglue,

12:40.446 --> 12:43.414
I accidentally glued my wiener
to my remote control helicopter.

12:43.456 --> 12:47.676
Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh, oh...!

12:47.753 --> 12:49.921
Accidentally on purpose.

12:51.564 --> 12:52.539
Hello, my lady.

12:52.569 --> 12:54.136
Hello, my boyfriend Nathan.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.685
So, how about we take this
to the next level?

12:56.715 --> 12:58.323
You wanna make out?
Okay, on three.

12:58.353 --> 13:00.363
One... Ah...

13:00.393 --> 13:03.038
No. I mean, take me
backstage to meet Pam.

13:03.068 --> 13:05.513
Wait, are you only going out
with me to get to Pam?

13:05.543 --> 13:07.177
Don't tell me how to love you!

13:07.248 --> 13:09.325
Nathan, you might be in this
for the wrong reasons.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.596
I think we should break up.

13:10.626 --> 13:12.000
Fine. Throw away the best thing

13:12.030 --> 13:13.538
that's ever happened to you.

13:13.568 --> 13:15.427
I don't really think
this is the best...

13:15.457 --> 13:18.203
But know this!
I will taste Pam's hair!

13:18.233 --> 13:21.413
And there's nothing you can do
to stop me! Let's stay friends.

13:21.443 --> 13:23.522
It smells like it's time
for our favourite segment...

13:23.552 --> 13:25.401
"Hey, Good Cookin'"!

13:25.472 --> 13:27.783
So, whatcha got cookin' up
today, Bob?

13:27.813 --> 13:30.132
Well, Chuck, it's the "I'm
Gonna Get You Succotash Burger."

13:30.162 --> 13:31.695
(CHUCKLES) That's rich.

13:31.725 --> 13:33.523
So I'm just chopping up
some tomatoes. Mm-hmm.

13:33.553 --> 13:35.373
And then I'm going to, uh...

13:35.403 --> 13:36.946
You all right there?
Yeah.

13:36.976 --> 13:37.748
Mm-hmm.
That's funny.

13:37.778 --> 13:39.503
I'll hold onto that.

13:39.533 --> 13:42.295
Well, why don't we just
get the burger on the bun?

13:42.325 --> 13:43.566
How 'bout that, Chuck?
Okay.

13:43.596 --> 13:45.372
Gene!

13:45.402 --> 13:47.119
ALL: Beefsquatch!
Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch!

13:47.158 --> 13:50.605
Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch!
Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch!

13:50.635 --> 13:52.812
Well if it isn't
Mr. Spatula Knife Hands!

13:52.842 --> 13:54.116
Oh, hi, Beefsquatch.

13:54.146 --> 13:55.554
Go ahead.
Have a burger.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.285
Don't mind if I do!

13:58.828 --> 14:01.630
(GRUNTS, SCREAMING)

14:01.703 --> 14:04.205
(LAUGHING) I put peppers in it!

14:04.278 --> 14:08.195
You bastard!
I'm gonna get you for this!

14:08.225 --> 14:09.592
Bring it on, Beefcrotch!

14:11.284 --> 14:12.284
(SCREAMS)

14:13.123 --> 14:14.573
(SCREAMS)

14:20.142 --> 14:21.595
(LAUGHTER)

14:25.662 --> 14:27.497
(SPITTING): Kitty litter!

14:44.740 --> 14:47.017
What a crazy couple weeks, huh?

14:47.047 --> 14:49.023
Anyone want to talk about it?

14:49.087 --> 14:50.829
I just got out
of a serious relationship.

14:50.859 --> 14:51.732
Tina, shush.

14:51.762 --> 14:53.270
Well, I am doing great!

14:53.300 --> 14:56.180
How about you, son?
Great here, Dad.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.704
Why don't you give me a big hug!
Love to.

14:58.734 --> 15:00.175
That would be great.

15:00.205 --> 15:02.282
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:02.312 --> 15:03.813
LINDA: Oh, bullhonk!

15:03.867 --> 15:06.235
Pam warned me about this
when she was binge-drinking.

15:06.309 --> 15:08.210
She said fame destroys families.

15:08.281 --> 15:10.391
And this family's going
right in the crapper.

15:10.421 --> 15:12.163
So that is why...

15:12.193 --> 15:14.478
I think you two
should quit the show.

15:14.551 --> 15:16.160
Tell him to quit.
Tell him to quit.

15:16.190 --> 15:16.989
Him!
Him!

15:17.059 --> 15:18.534
Well, I quit!

15:18.564 --> 15:20.071
The dirty tricks department
is closed!

15:20.101 --> 15:21.627
What are you talking about?

15:21.657 --> 15:23.131
Nothing.
Forget it.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.787
Hey, we had some good times,
didn't we?

15:24.817 --> 15:26.494
Were you helping him?
Were you helping him?

15:26.524 --> 15:27.495
Jinx.
Yeah, I'm out!

15:27.525 --> 15:29.702
I'm sick of your dark,
twisted games.

15:29.732 --> 15:31.274
I'm going to go take a shower.

15:31.304 --> 15:32.771
Wash this filth off me.

15:32.842 --> 15:34.250
Filthy!
Filthy!

15:34.280 --> 15:35.822
Look, if you guys
aren't gonna quit,

15:35.852 --> 15:37.928
then I'm gonna go talk
to Chuck and Pam myself!

15:37.958 --> 15:40.402
Pam and I are tight!
She'll put an end to this.

15:40.432 --> 15:41.623
No.
What?

15:41.653 --> 15:43.412
But what about all that stuff
you said

15:43.442 --> 15:44.943
about fame destroying
relationships?

15:45.014 --> 15:46.924
That's just something
famous people say.

15:46.954 --> 15:49.130
Look, we've struck gold here,
and I will be damned

15:49.160 --> 15:51.973
if I'm gonna let some mama bear
come in here and ruin it!

15:52.003 --> 15:54.314
So unless you work
for the network or the affiliate

15:54.344 --> 15:56.788
or the FCC, I can legally
pretend that you don't exist.

15:56.818 --> 15:57.959
Well, you're not getting rid

15:57.989 --> 15:59.212
of this mama bear so easy!

15:59.242 --> 16:00.417
Yes, I am. Security.

16:00.463 --> 16:03.465
Hey! Oh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh!

16:06.354 --> 16:09.361
CHUCK: <i>Hey,
you see those guys over there</i>

16:09.391 --> 16:12.193
with the untucked dress shirts?
I'll go tuck 'em in.

16:12.266 --> 16:13.809
No, no.
They hate that.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.637
That's the VP and assistant VP
of programming.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.119
They're talking about a spin-off.

16:17.149 --> 16:18.991
A spin-off? Your own show,
guys, with me producing.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.463
It could be bigger than <i>Get On Up.</i>

16:20.493 --> 16:21.900
Well, bigger than <i>Get On Down,</i>

16:21.930 --> 16:23.768
which is the midnight
rebroadcast of <i>Get On Up.</i>

16:23.798 --> 16:25.630
We're gonna be moderately wealthy!

16:25.660 --> 16:27.451
I could date someone half my age...

16:27.481 --> 16:29.425
five-and-a-half-year-old starlet.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.996
Yeah, so it would really seal
the deal

16:31.026 --> 16:32.484
if you guys would, you know,

16:32.514 --> 16:34.553
physically attack each other
a little bit. Or a lot.

16:34.583 --> 16:35.761
Interesting.

16:35.791 --> 16:36.832
Sure.
Mm-hmm.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.203
Makes perfect sense, right?

16:38.233 --> 16:39.540
It's a cooking segment, so, yeah.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.513
Great! And physical violence
on three.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.828
I'm not doing it.
One, two, three.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.338
Physical violence!
Physical violence!

16:45.375 --> 16:46.922
Have you seen my mom anywhere?

16:46.959 --> 16:48.802
Yeah, I threw her out.
But that's funny.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.521
I just let you go backstage
a second ago.

16:51.564 --> 16:53.632
Huh.
I wonder where I was going?

16:53.715 --> 16:55.676
NATHAN: Just let me taste it!

16:55.715 --> 16:57.375
Get off of me!

16:57.413 --> 16:58.753
Hey, Tina, check out Tina.

16:58.790 --> 16:59.898
Nathan! No!

16:59.933 --> 17:01.567
No, no, no.

17:01.648 --> 17:02.855
What is going on?!

17:02.891 --> 17:03.814
Let me go!

17:03.849 --> 17:04.898
I don't think that...

17:04.974 --> 17:06.025
we can stay friends.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.742
Security!

17:07.781 --> 17:08.555
Hey, Mom.

17:08.588 --> 17:10.489
What the...?

17:10.571 --> 17:13.352
Oh, sorry. This is
my ex-boyfriend, Nathan.

17:13.396 --> 17:14.963
Aw, you two couldn't make it work?

17:15.041 --> 17:16.576
No, we couldn't make it work.
No.

17:16.655 --> 17:19.603
And eight, and nine, and ten...

17:19.646 --> 17:21.457
PAM: Oh, wow!

17:21.496 --> 17:23.174
CHUCK: Looking mazel-tough,
Exercise Rabbi.

17:23.212 --> 17:26.724
PAM: Call the fire department
'cause my buns are burning!

17:26.771 --> 17:28.583
Speaking of buns,
I think I can smell some.

17:28.622 --> 17:30.940
And it must be time for...
"Hey, Good Cookin'"!

17:31.024 --> 17:33.036
So, what's cookin', Bob?
Well, Chuck,

17:33.075 --> 17:35.153
it's the Every Breath
You Tikka Masala Burger.

17:35.193 --> 17:37.237
(CHUCKLES) We start with
a little coconut milk.

17:37.277 --> 17:38.719
Mm-hmm. Right? There it is.

17:38.756 --> 17:40.398
There's the coconut milk.
No one cares.

17:40.436 --> 17:41.778
And then, some curry paste...

17:41.814 --> 17:43.491
You want me to even pick it up

17:43.529 --> 17:45.004
'cause no one's listening?

17:45.041 --> 17:46.559
Whatever, whatever.
Just move it along.

17:46.596 --> 17:48.163
So, yeah, that's curry paste.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.843
GENE: I'm bored up here!

17:49.881 --> 17:52.016
Yeah, should I go to the next
ingredient or just...?

17:52.099 --> 17:53.040
Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch!

17:53.108 --> 17:54.174
Beefsquatch!

17:54.217 --> 17:55.267
Beefsquatch!

17:55.326 --> 17:56.360
More scotch.

17:56.436 --> 17:57.292
Beefsquatch!

17:57.326 --> 17:59.354
GENE: My ears are burning!

17:59.394 --> 18:02.846
Beefsquatch took you down!
That's it!

18:02.957 --> 18:04.590
Beef fight! Beef fight!
Beef fight!

18:04.654 --> 18:05.828
Come here, beef boy!

18:05.864 --> 18:06.947
(GENE YELLING)

18:09.410 --> 18:10.869
No matter what, don't stop rolling.

18:10.906 --> 18:11.729
(BOTH GRUNTING)

18:11.763 --> 18:13.247
Oh, my God!

18:13.342 --> 18:15.443
They're gonna kill each other!
On TV!

18:16.989 --> 18:19.474
Are you not entertained?!

18:19.561 --> 18:21.295
No... a little.
Not you!

18:23.488 --> 18:24.705
Oh, stop it! Stop it!

18:24.781 --> 18:26.508
Oh, Louise, Tina, Boy-Tina,

18:26.546 --> 18:28.808
we got to get in there!

18:28.849 --> 18:31.723
Anyone want to help me
throw this through the window?

18:31.806 --> 18:34.219
You're a bad, bad boy!

18:34.260 --> 18:35.860
It stinks in here!

18:37.722 --> 18:39.462
Bob, Gene, look at yourselves!

18:39.537 --> 18:41.146
You're father and son!

18:41.184 --> 18:43.384
You're supposed to love each
other, not kill each other.

18:43.424 --> 18:45.113
This isn't the Bible!

18:45.151 --> 18:48.483
This show has torn my mily
apart long enough! It ends now!

18:48.529 --> 18:52.145
Kids, cover your ears.
FCC, here comes Linda!

18:52.192 --> 18:56.712
Dagnabbit, pee popper,
nuts to poppa, stinka boob taka,

18:56.764 --> 18:58.631
momma kaga, poopa daddy!

18:58.696 --> 19:00.138
What was that?

19:00.175 --> 19:01.843
I'm cursing on live TV!

19:01.922 --> 19:03.799
Uh, those aren't curse words.
Not even close.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.485
Okay.
Well, how 'bout this?

19:06.528 --> 19:07.878
No, no!
No nudity! No nudity!

19:07.956 --> 19:08.722
(SCREAMS)

19:08.797 --> 19:09.797
Aw, sick!

19:09.872 --> 19:12.117
This is to save my family!

19:12.158 --> 19:14.059
A-boobity-boobity-boobity-boo!

19:14.141 --> 19:14.574
Wow.

19:14.645 --> 19:15.278
Whoa!

19:15.350 --> 19:15.917
Whoa.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.290
DVR! DVR!

19:17.367 --> 19:19.412
You said to keep rolling.
We're done. We're done.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.178
Yeah, by the way,
the same thing happened

19:21.216 --> 19:22.534
with the chimp on <i>The Today Show.</i>

19:22.570 --> 19:23.802
Shut your mouth!

19:23.838 --> 19:24.828
You have a smart mouth.
You have a smart mouth.

19:24.863 --> 19:25.943
Oh, you shut that.
Shove it!

19:26.006 --> 19:27.581
Wow.
Yeah, no kidding.

19:27.619 --> 19:30.617
I can't believe
she did that... for us.

19:30.661 --> 19:33.592
Yeah, milk, saving families.
What can't breasts do?

19:33.636 --> 19:35.487
Milking the cow!
Milking the cow!

19:35.585 --> 19:38.015
Listen, I'm sorry, Gene,
about everything.

19:38.056 --> 19:40.669
I let the whole TV thing
go to my head.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.254
No, I'm sorry.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.486
This thing turned me
into a monster!

19:44.527 --> 19:47.562
But I'm not a monster!
I'm a real boy!

19:47.635 --> 19:49.980
Come on, Dad! Solidarity!

19:50.022 --> 19:51.380
Oh, God.
(CHUCKLES)

19:51.417 --> 19:53.143
Gene, you have let yourself go.

19:53.182 --> 19:55.108
Bobida-boobida-bop-bop-bop-Ba!

19:55.147 --> 19:56.843
Ah, okay, well, now,
now we stopped rolling.

19:56.881 --> 19:58.069
So there's no need for you...

19:58.108 --> 19:59.046
Ah, what the hell.

19:59.081 --> 20:01.137
Boobity-boobity-Ba-bida-Ba.

20:01.181 --> 20:02.069
Ha-ha!

20:02.122 --> 20:03.631
I love you, Dad!

20:03.668 --> 20:07.084
I love you, too, son!
I love you, Pam!

20:07.131 --> 20:09.676
REPORTER: And so,
facing major fines from the FCC,

20:09.719 --> 20:13.670
this long-running talk show
may have had its last word.

20:13.719 --> 20:15.853
Just a little too (CHUCKLES)
titillating.

20:15.937 --> 20:18.617
Well, you two may be regular,
unfamous schmucks now,

20:18.660 --> 20:20.861
but at least
this family's back to normal.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.020
Amen!
You said it!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.780
Single and ready to mingle.

20:23.819 --> 20:25.978
Yeah. And thanks, Lin, for
showing us some perspective.

20:26.019 --> 20:28.316
Among other things.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.224
Show's over, Teddy.
Come on.

20:30.306 --> 20:33.555
Sorry, Lin. It's just, ah, you
imagine something for so long,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.912
and then what you thought
was pink is brown,

20:35.953 --> 20:37.964
and what you thought
was symmetrical is not.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.084
It's just unsettling.
Teddy, please.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.797
Gene, what'd you do with your mask?

20:41.835 --> 20:43.712
Did you throw it in a volcano?

20:43.751 --> 20:45.829
Nah. I gave it back
to Peter Pescadero.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.281
I promised him he would
pop and lock his way

20:48.323 --> 20:50.065
to a better life,
and I did not deliver.

20:50.104 --> 20:51.913
Another child left behind.

20:51.952 --> 20:54.197
Well, it's certainly nice
to have the old Gene back.

20:54.238 --> 20:55.412
(FARTING SOUND) What?

20:55.448 --> 20:57.693
I said it's nice to have the old...

20:57.733 --> 20:59.209
(FARTING SOUND) It's nice...

20:59.246 --> 21:01.013
Okay, I'm done talking to you.
