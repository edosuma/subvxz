If anything turns up,
contact me immediately

00:03.097 --> 00:04.496
Yes, I will

00:07.735 --> 00:11.501
It's nice to see
you working hard

00:11.839 --> 00:14.967
Keep up the good work,
and ask if you need help

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.593 --> 00:34.083
Do you know this woman?

00:36.163 --> 00:38.154
LEE Ji-hyun, or
LEE Jeong-hyun?

00:38.332 --> 00:39.856
So you do know

00:41.669 --> 00:43.261
Where is she?

00:45.773 --> 00:47.673
She's the one.
Where is she?

00:48.409 --> 00:50.070
She didn't do this

00:52.446 --> 00:54.209
It's not a human who did it

00:54.381 --> 00:58.647
Sure, then who did?
Huh? Answer me!

00:58.719 --> 01:01.415
Ji-hyun believes her
dead sister is taking revenge

01:01.956 --> 01:04.550
- If this store...
- Do you really believe that?

01:04.992 --> 01:08.223
She was a mental patient.
Did you know that?

01:12.166 --> 01:13.656
Look

01:13.768 --> 01:17.864
This is her doing, for not
receiving any compensation

01:31.519 --> 01:33.578
Where is the chairman?

01:35.623 --> 01:38.751
I devoted my whole life to
this store, and now what?

01:39.260 --> 01:41.228
Give up my management rights?

01:42.229 --> 01:47.292
Damn stockholders sit at their
desks, scheming all day

01:56.076 --> 01:58.135
The keys... in the waiting room

02:00.214 --> 02:02.011
Hurry up!

02:50.965 --> 02:52.557
Where's my sister?

02:52.633 --> 02:56.034
Save her! Save my sister!

02:58.772 --> 03:01.502
If we don't find
my sister soon,

03:01.842 --> 03:04.174
something awful will happen

03:06.413 --> 03:08.506
Oh, really?

03:09.717 --> 03:14.154
Where could she be?
We'd like to know, too

03:15.823 --> 03:19.156
You mean your sister
inside the mirror?

03:22.263 --> 03:24.561
If she won't talk,
she should write it down,

03:24.632 --> 03:28.068
or at least gesture
with her hands or feet!

03:29.670 --> 03:31.297
Look here, Ji-hyun!

03:31.672 --> 03:35.199
I know some shady transactions
took place in General Affairs

03:35.276 --> 03:37.574
Your hospital bills all
came from there too

03:38.412 --> 03:40.539
You had tons of cash
in your account

03:40.648 --> 03:42.377
Did your sister ever
tell you about that money?

03:43.784 --> 03:46.378
Somebody used her
and then killed her

03:47.521 --> 03:49.455
If we don't find
my sister soon,

03:49.657 --> 03:51.887
something awful
is going to happen

03:57.998 --> 04:01.263
Shit! I'm going crazy!

04:04.672 --> 04:06.970
As Chief of Security here,

04:07.107 --> 04:10.599
you can't even protect
the company's top administrator?

04:12.046 --> 04:14.537
Today HA Hyun-su
caught the criminal

04:15.382 --> 04:17.178
And saved my life

04:18.851 --> 04:23.152
From today, you should
give up your transferal here

04:25.726 --> 04:28.024
I'm ashamed that
you're my nephew

04:30.965 --> 04:33.229
You're the man, Detective Ha!

04:34.134 --> 04:36.659
I don't know.
I really don't

04:36.737 --> 04:38.432
What do you mean?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.700
Everyone agrees that it's her

04:42.176 --> 04:45.577
There's no hard evidence... shit!

04:45.813 --> 04:49.340
She was caught attempting
murder who needs evidence?

04:50.351 --> 04:52.478
And we have witnesses

04:52.886 --> 04:55.013
People said they
saw ghosts, right?

04:55.089 --> 04:57.853
I'm sure it was her
that they saw

05:09.003 --> 05:14.464
Um, Chairman JEON
asked me to give this

05:15.943 --> 05:17.604
It's for you

05:47.007 --> 05:50.909
Oh, good evening,
Detective HA Hyun-su!

05:56.717 --> 05:58.947
How did this happen?

05:59.787 --> 06:01.982
You're not allowed in here

06:05.392 --> 06:10.056
I mean, you caught a serial
killer with no evidence

06:12.166 --> 06:17.035
What kind of fucked-up
circumstance is that?

06:18.238 --> 06:20.900
The store will open on
schedule in two days

06:21.675 --> 06:26.203
The killer caught, the store
re-opens. Need anything else?

06:30.250 --> 06:33.378
Who said she's the killer?

06:34.555 --> 06:36.580
Where's the evidence?

06:37.591 --> 06:41.254
She's unbalanced anyway.
She'll be sent to the mental

06:41.328 --> 06:42.818
You're not making sense!

06:48.836 --> 06:51.327
Who's the one not
making sense here?

06:57.811 --> 07:00.780
Look, Detective HA Hyun-su...

07:03.083 --> 07:06.382
However much you
want a promotion,

07:06.854 --> 07:10.346
don't go locking up just anyone

07:11.058 --> 07:14.084
What? You bastard!

07:14.728 --> 07:17.196
Getting drunk and coming
here talking nonsense

07:18.165 --> 07:21.464
Be grateful I didn't lock you up

07:23.537 --> 07:26.734
Going around shooting when
your partner's held hostage

07:30.577 --> 07:32.340
He was my partner

07:34.214 --> 07:35.909
He was my friend

07:38.752 --> 07:40.413
Stupid asshole!

07:43.190 --> 07:44.714
You shithead!

07:45.425 --> 07:49.794
Yeah? You want to go at it?
You're drunk again, aren't you?

07:49.897 --> 07:53.060
Shit! Firing away when
your partner's being held?

07:53.167 --> 07:56.136
Now you're propped up by
your uncle. Chief of Security?

07:56.236 --> 07:59.569
Is life such a joke for you?

07:59.907 --> 08:03.001
What else can an irresponsible
bastard like you do?

08:03.076 --> 08:06.637
Irresponsible? That's well said

08:06.947 --> 08:09.609
Did you forget what you said
when you became inspector?

08:09.683 --> 08:13.642
Now the higher-ups are slipping
you cash to wrap it up quickly

08:13.720 --> 08:17.315
You nervous about
not getting promoted?

08:18.192 --> 08:21.684
Even without all that,
I'll never live like you

08:21.728 --> 08:23.889
I won't live like you, bastard!

08:24.064 --> 08:26.032
What the hell do you
know about me?

08:26.500 --> 08:30.732
How can a pampered, spoon-fed
bastard like you understand me?

08:32.639 --> 08:35.164
Try living like me once!

08:35.542 --> 08:37.635
Self-centered bastard

08:52.626 --> 08:57.256
Last Tuesday was a year since
Young-ho's death. Remember?

08:58.732 --> 09:00.996
Don't you feel sorry for his wife?

09:04.104 --> 09:08.768
You asshole! You asshole!

09:32.299 --> 09:34.460
Where did it go?

09:35.068 --> 09:37.127
See you later

09:37.237 --> 09:38.932
Bye now

10:23.483 --> 10:26.509
How did you end up like this?

10:30.290 --> 10:33.919
Why did this have to happen?

10:54.047 --> 10:56.038
Sorry

11:01.088 --> 11:03.113
I'm sorry

11:07.461 --> 11:10.453
I'm sorry, I really am

12:43.290 --> 12:45.190
CHOI Mi-jeong

12:48.562 --> 12:51.292
631-2683

12:53.333 --> 12:55.267
BAEK Jin-su

12:58.071 --> 13:00.471
631-268

13:02.042 --> 13:03.703
Hey, hurry up!

13:03.810 --> 13:05.744
Detective HA! Take a look at...

13:05.879 --> 13:08.313
I said hurry up!
IM Jun-seok is dead!

13:08.381 --> 13:10.906
What?

14:04.604 --> 14:06.663
LEE, Ji-Hyun

14:06.806 --> 14:10.640
She was hospitalized in Bucheon,
I thought you might know her

14:10.744 --> 14:12.473
Right

14:16.016 --> 14:17.745
Detective HA!

14:30.997 --> 14:32.931
Have it tested for fingerprints

14:38.738 --> 14:42.538
Ji-hyun had a deep admiration
and attachment for her sister

14:42.642 --> 14:47.136
After they separated,
she suffered a nervous breakdown

14:47.480 --> 14:49.948
Then her sister died last year,

14:50.016 --> 14:52.382
and with no guardian,
she was discharged

14:52.519 --> 14:54.953
Excuse me, but...
what are these lockers?

14:56.890 --> 15:01.918
These used to be
in the General Ward

15:02.195 --> 15:05.062
They were going to be
discarded, so we took them

15:05.565 --> 15:09.729
By any chance,
is there a locker #805?

15:11.338 --> 15:13.932
Well, there were three wards

15:14.040 --> 15:17.840
so the numbers
only went up to 399

15:18.578 --> 15:22.912
Blood Type: AB

15:24.250 --> 15:28.584
We've removed all the furniture
and articles that were here

15:36.496 --> 15:38.088
Thank you

15:39.532 --> 15:41.625
The mirror is still here

15:43.870 --> 15:48.000
Ji-hyun's sister
requested this for her

15:48.241 --> 15:51.972
Ji-hyun used to feel
nervous without a mirror

15:54.180 --> 15:56.273
Did her sister come often to visit?

15:56.349 --> 15:57.714
No

15:57.784 --> 16:01.220
Instead, she called
Ji-hyun every night

16:01.721 --> 16:05.919
It wasn't allowed, but there was
something special between them

16:06.693 --> 16:08.558
We couldn't stop them

16:10.296 --> 16:17.566
Oh, the last time she visited
was the day before she died

16:35.088 --> 16:38.922
Wait, there must be a #208

16:39.492 --> 16:40.959
What?

16:43.029 --> 16:44.690
The locker number

16:58.912 --> 17:00.709
I know that painting

17:00.847 --> 17:02.314
You recognize this?

17:02.449 --> 17:06.010
Sure, look in the mirror there

17:06.853 --> 17:11.153
You can see the figure of
the artist painting. Amazing, huh?

17:12.125 --> 17:15.424
This here... what is that?
Is it writing?

17:15.994 --> 17:17.791
Oh, what was it?

17:18.164 --> 17:21.361
"I was here..."

17:21.768 --> 17:25.499
I think that's what it meant.
I don't remember...

17:40.353 --> 17:42.685
So you were here?

18:04.911 --> 18:06.378
What?

18:06.913 --> 18:09.905
How can CS Trade Co. Expect
to buy out our company?

18:10.150 --> 18:11.811
Chairman JEON!

18:12.952 --> 18:15.716
Haven't you done enough?

18:16.189 --> 18:18.248
Wouldn't you like to rest awhile?

18:18.358 --> 18:19.825
Director CHOI!

18:19.959 --> 18:22.359
Don't speak so lightly of
other people's business

18:22.929 --> 18:26.160
You've gotten where you are
due to this department store?

18:26.366 --> 18:29.631
If it weren't for me,
you'd be a village police chief!

18:39.746 --> 18:43.580
This picture... look at this picture

18:44.250 --> 18:46.309
Who took it?

18:53.893 --> 18:55.952
You drew this, right?

18:56.429 --> 18:58.363
You saw it too?

18:59.566 --> 19:01.796
What your sister
wanted to tell?

19:02.468 --> 19:04.561
If your sister was murdered,

19:05.071 --> 19:08.131
she'd tell you who did it? Right?

19:10.844 --> 19:12.744
Who was it?

19:14.347 --> 19:17.111
It was someone my sister met

19:18.418 --> 19:20.443
I think they met at work

19:21.287 --> 19:23.255
She said, Director CHOI...

19:26.693 --> 19:30.026
CHOI... Director CHOI Sang-ki?

19:31.564 --> 19:34.226
He asked for my
sister's account book

19:34.567 --> 19:38.628
Even after the accident,
he took care of me

19:40.974 --> 19:42.601
Just a minute

19:43.743 --> 19:47.577
Detective HA, they
identified the fingerprints

19:54.721 --> 19:56.848
I know who killed
LEE Jeong-hyun

20:02.795 --> 20:04.387
Chief Woo!

20:06.466 --> 20:08.866
I arrest you for
IM Jun-seok's murder

20:12.038 --> 20:13.630
IM Jun-seok?

20:14.474 --> 20:16.374
Something's wrong

20:16.476 --> 20:18.239
What is this?

20:18.678 --> 20:21.078
It's Director CHOI
who killed LEE Jeong-hyun

20:25.351 --> 20:27.819
You expect me
to believe that?

20:29.289 --> 20:31.519
Where is the evidence?

20:32.058 --> 20:34.549
Will you take that crazy
bitch's words for evidence?

20:36.296 --> 20:38.230
Investigate Director CHOI

20:38.932 --> 20:42.663
LEE Jeong-hyun did not die
in the fire. Check the body!

20:53.780 --> 20:55.543
There will be evidence, okay?

20:56.115 --> 20:57.742
There will be evidence

21:10.697 --> 21:12.528
Where are you going?

21:22.442 --> 21:24.273
Detective HA Hyun-su?

21:24.377 --> 21:25.867
Yes, that's me

21:26.679 --> 21:28.374
- Come this way
- Yes

21:33.419 --> 21:36.320
I looked for
the data you requested

21:38.191 --> 21:40.625
LEE Jeong-hyun...

21:42.095 --> 21:44.655
her body was identified
by some co-workers

21:45.031 --> 21:49.195
But actually, it was so burned
it was totally unrecognizable

21:50.103 --> 21:51.934
Then how did you identify it?

21:52.438 --> 21:55.601
Well, she didn't
appear afterwards,

21:55.641 --> 21:57.541
so we assumed it was her

21:57.643 --> 22:01.272
The co-workers came
and said it was her, so...

22:02.148 --> 22:05.276
But didn't you have
to do an autopsy?

22:05.351 --> 22:07.478
Blood Type: B

22:07.520 --> 22:08.509
They probably
gave it a quick look

22:15.828 --> 22:18.490
Can identical twins have
different blood types?

22:20.133 --> 22:26.902
Sir! It's not just blood type,
their DNA is exactly the same

22:28.241 --> 22:30.641
She had a twin?

22:32.912 --> 22:36.575
Isn't it scary to work here?

22:37.116 --> 22:38.708
With the corpses?

22:39.652 --> 22:44.180
I heard you can see
dead people in the mirror

22:46.626 --> 22:49.322
That's why there are no mirrors
in the body storage room

22:51.364 --> 22:55.596
Funny? Still, before that a few
people went crazy and quit

22:56.235 --> 22:58.829
A lot of strange
things happen here

23:00.006 --> 23:02.907
You may not believe it,
but I've experienced it too

23:03.609 --> 23:05.873
On my first day working here

23:07.080 --> 23:09.310
Was it last year?

23:10.116 --> 23:13.643
A man shot in
a hostage incident came in

23:14.053 --> 23:16.351
After the autopsy, I was
applying cosmetics

23:17.690 --> 23:21.592
Just before, I had taken
the corpse from the freezer

23:22.028 --> 23:25.623
In the door's reflection,
I saw a hole in his head

23:26.766 --> 23:29.496
A perfectly placed
bullet in his forehead

23:30.369 --> 23:32.337
The real corpse had none

23:33.272 --> 23:36.400
I really saw it.
No one believes me

24:05.471 --> 24:06.472
CS Trade to Buy Out Dreampia

24:06.472 --> 24:10.465
"SecuZone" assists in securing
management rights

24:16.816 --> 24:21.219
I may have seen her at work,
but I don't know anything

24:21.921 --> 24:23.616
Nothing for me to know

24:24.357 --> 24:27.724
Anyway, I feel bad
about Chief Woo

24:31.264 --> 24:34.722
Well, congratulations Director
CHOI... No, Chairman CHOI

24:37.203 --> 24:41.071
Anyway, when will you
acquire Dreampia?

24:42.308 --> 24:46.438
If I'd known, I'd have
bought some stock myself

24:47.747 --> 24:51.148
Don't you need to
be working someplace?

24:51.450 --> 24:55.284
You're right. Just need
to tidy things up now

24:57.690 --> 24:59.055
Very well

25:03.362 --> 25:09.028
Oh, by the way. How do
you know Chief Woo?

25:15.374 --> 25:18.366
Welcome to Dreampia!

25:29.789 --> 25:31.689
Detective HA, let's go back

25:33.693 --> 25:35.991
Everyone's too scared to go in

25:36.729 --> 25:38.720
I wouldn't go if they paid me

25:43.469 --> 25:45.164
It's money!

26:03.256 --> 26:04.780
DREAMPIA.
Designer Fashion Show in B1 Event Hall

27:37.883 --> 27:39.578
What's going on?

27:54.066 --> 27:58.025
There's nothing wrong!
Please calm down!

28:14.053 --> 28:15.987
Chairman CHOI Intends
Change of Business for Dreampia

28:18.257 --> 28:20.851
Open the door!
You are in danger

28:23.596 --> 28:25.860
What's so dangerous here?

28:26.499 --> 28:29.900
This is my home.
It's my home

28:29.969 --> 28:33.166
Please open the door.
Come out quickly

28:34.907 --> 28:37.603
Get out of my home!

28:38.878 --> 28:40.505
Get out!

28:41.847 --> 28:43.712
We can't end it like this

28:44.283 --> 28:46.683
Let me re-investigate
from last year's fire

28:47.853 --> 28:49.844
Detective HA,
this isn't like you

28:49.955 --> 28:51.513
It's over

28:51.690 --> 28:54.454
- There's no point in continuing
- Chief!

28:55.494 --> 28:58.327
And have you been
keeping in line?

29:00.399 --> 29:02.367
You've been passed
over for promotion

30:36.529 --> 30:38.087
What about the re-opening?

30:40.399 --> 30:42.299
As you wished,
it was cancelled

30:47.206 --> 30:48.867
Let me out

30:50.876 --> 30:53.709
Jeong-hyun is in that store.
If we don't find her...

30:53.846 --> 30:55.871
I don't believe in ghosts

30:55.981 --> 30:58.347
And the evidence
on Director CHOI?

30:58.417 --> 31:00.351
You'll need evidence

31:04.390 --> 31:06.187
You know too?

31:07.927 --> 31:09.758
You know too, right?

31:17.503 --> 31:21.030
No, I don't know
what you're talking about

31:27.780 --> 31:30.578
- Officer Kim! Follow me
- Yes!

31:39.858 --> 31:42.691
Yes, I've discovered something
about LEE Jeong-hyun

31:43.462 --> 31:45.054
Yes

31:47.166 --> 31:49.760
I think I need to
see you, Director CHOI

31:51.770 --> 31:53.362
Yes

31:55.240 --> 31:57.708
Come here to Dreampia now

31:59.612 --> 32:03.639
Yes, yes. I understand

32:21.934 --> 32:23.492
Hello?

32:23.802 --> 32:25.599
Oh, yes. Hello...

32:25.838 --> 32:27.362
Yes

32:27.473 --> 32:30.965
Thank you for remembering
my husband's one-year memorial

32:31.844 --> 32:34.642
That day was so busy,
I couldn't see you off

32:34.747 --> 32:36.442
No, don't mention it

32:36.515 --> 32:38.574
Of course, I had to come

32:39.084 --> 32:43.521
I'm not in touch with Young-min
lately... I heard you see him

32:44.690 --> 32:49.389
This time too he came
alone to tend to the grave.

32:51.296 --> 32:54.026
Tell him many thanks...

32:54.133 --> 32:55.657
Oh, yes

32:55.801 --> 32:58.361
I'll tell him

32:58.871 --> 33:01.066
Yes, goodbye

33:19.158 --> 33:20.716
Young-ho

33:27.499 --> 33:30.491
BAEK, CHOI received calls from
same number just before death.

33:45.451 --> 33:48.147
This is Director CHOI.
Please leave a message

34:42.274 --> 34:44.400
Why are you still here?

34:45.177 --> 34:47.145
I'm sorry, Young-min

34:47.513 --> 34:49.139
Chairman!

34:49.715 --> 34:51.444
Go now

34:54.485 --> 34:56.112
Uncle!

35:29.621 --> 35:31.088
Uncle!

35:55.180 --> 35:57.444
I can't find my sister

36:21.974 --> 36:23.669
Why is that ringing now?

36:26.311 --> 36:31.715
It's the time when my sister
always called to the hospital

36:49.368 --> 36:52.826
It's my sister

36:54.306 --> 36:55.967
It's a mirror

37:32.277 --> 37:33.767
Jeong-hyun

37:54.599 --> 37:56.567
You finally found her

38:13.685 --> 38:15.846
I was a bit concerned about that,

38:17.856 --> 38:21.383
but I waited, figuring
it'd be my store soon

38:26.999 --> 38:28.557
Where is it?

38:35.207 --> 38:38.904
She didn't make idle threats

38:39.511 --> 38:41.138
Why did you kill her?

38:47.953 --> 38:49.978
What do you care?

38:52.524 --> 38:55.152
Everything about you is
recorded in here in detail

38:55.761 --> 39:00.323
If this makes it to the police
or the press, you're finished

39:02.234 --> 39:03.929
Why did you kill her?

39:05.904 --> 39:10.898
I paid a lot of money to
General Affairs to facilitate a buyout

39:11.376 --> 39:14.504
Jeong-hyun, that bitch,
betrayed me halfway through

39:15.347 --> 39:18.282
She said that she'd
expose everything

39:18.383 --> 39:21.250
Do I pass up a once in
a lifetime chance because of her?

39:21.853 --> 39:24.219
Such opportunities
come only once

39:24.990 --> 39:28.892
Let it go, and you
regret it always

39:30.796 --> 39:33.458
So you made it seem
she died in the fire?

39:33.632 --> 39:35.827
The General Affairs
people took care of it

39:37.169 --> 39:41.868
So she murdered the
people in General Affairs

39:42.007 --> 39:43.565
LEE Jeong-hyun?

39:43.809 --> 39:45.868
A dead woman taking revenge?

39:46.278 --> 39:48.803
Anyone seen it?

39:49.181 --> 39:53.015
I don't believe
what I don't see

39:53.118 --> 39:56.019
With no courage to live on,
they killed themselves

39:56.288 --> 39:58.848
Bastards had no right to
live anyway, just like you

40:11.069 --> 40:14.732
If you hadn't come snooping,
this would've ended quietly

40:15.107 --> 40:19.009
I thought I'd make use of
a guy with a failed life

40:19.811 --> 40:23.770
I never guessed
you'd betray me so well

40:26.618 --> 40:32.454
Still, stupid people
follow orders well

40:33.024 --> 40:34.992
Thanks for calling me

40:36.628 --> 40:38.562
See you later

40:44.136 --> 40:46.104
What's the hell?

40:49.474 --> 40:51.704
Not everything's as it seems

40:52.577 --> 40:54.909
There never was anything there

40:57.282 --> 40:59.750
Damn bastards!

41:06.691 --> 41:08.784
Drop the gun, CHOI Sang-ki!

41:18.537 --> 41:22.303
CHOI Sang-ki, I hereby arrest you

41:22.340 --> 41:25.434
for the illegal buyout of
Dreampia through bribery,

41:25.544 --> 41:27.239
murder, and the concealment
of a dead body

41:27.412 --> 41:30.813
Die, bastard! Die!

41:39.391 --> 41:42.827
So, you want to tidy
things up now?

41:48.967 --> 41:50.935
Drop the gun, Young-min!

41:51.102 --> 41:53.036
Oh, shit!

41:53.171 --> 41:55.196
Want to screw up again?

41:55.340 --> 41:58.207
Is it Detective HA's turn now?

42:26.538 --> 42:28.938
You want to make
the same mistake again?

42:30.809 --> 42:32.674
I made no mistake

42:33.144 --> 42:34.702
You can't do it

42:35.714 --> 42:37.773
This is your image

42:38.250 --> 42:41.378
The image of
someone living in fear

42:44.089 --> 42:46.284
Lower your gun, Young-min

42:47.425 --> 42:49.359
I'm not you

43:02.307 --> 43:04.366
Go prove yourself, idiot!

43:27.732 --> 43:30.132
Drop the gun, Young-min!

43:33.638 --> 43:36.038
You can't do it

43:36.174 --> 43:38.267
It isn't possible

43:59.464 --> 44:01.432
Young-min!

44:02.567 --> 44:04.262
Fire!

44:09.641 --> 44:11.438
Crazy bastard

45:11.069 --> 45:12.696
Where's the account book?

45:12.804 --> 45:14.396
Tell me!

45:15.240 --> 45:17.674
I'll kill you

45:20.378 --> 45:22.369
No!

45:39.030 --> 45:41.624
So the sister's just as ruthless

45:41.933 --> 45:44.231
Blood never lies

46:05.223 --> 46:07.384
Stop it, CHOI Sang-ki

46:07.492 --> 46:09.960
It's all over now

46:17.902 --> 46:20.029
LEE Jeong-hyun?

48:01.539 --> 48:03.837
Chief Woo, are you okay?

48:03.908 --> 48:08.242
Mister, my uncle
is still in there

48:08.413 --> 48:11.712
- What?
- Quick, go in and find him

48:12.617 --> 48:14.949
Get a hold of yourself!

48:15.086 --> 48:20.080
This afternoon, he jumped
out his office window

48:20.458 --> 48:22.517
He killed himself

48:42.747 --> 48:47.514
Dreampia Dept. Store, scene of
a suicide and related deaths,

48:47.652 --> 48:52.282
re-opened today after resolving
families' compensation demands

48:52.590 --> 48:56.082
In addition, the team from
the Seoul Violent Crimes Division...

48:56.227 --> 48:58.889
were all granted a special
promotion in reward

48:59.364 --> 49:01.059
For our next story...

49:08.706 --> 49:11.300
Oh, how did you?

49:18.616 --> 49:20.311
Thank you

49:22.987 --> 49:24.682
Your sister?

49:37.001 --> 49:39.162
What will you do now?

49:42.240 --> 49:44.902
Thinking of taking up photography

49:45.143 --> 49:49.170
Your sister taught me
how to look at photos

50:00.958 --> 50:02.755
Just a moment

50:07.298 --> 50:09.528
Please sign your
discharge papers

50:11.903 --> 50:13.666
Here

50:42.467 --> 50:45.265
This patient signs
his name backwards!

51:06.390 --> 51:09.188
Self-hatred, triggered
by a mental shock,

51:09.260 --> 51:11.353
causes a personality to split,

51:11.829 --> 51:15.560
and you perceive two worlds,
inside and outside the mirror

51:20.471 --> 51:23.599
The world is divided into
two symmetrical worlds,

51:23.941 --> 51:27.775
that is, the person is
psychologically divided in two

51:31.482 --> 51:33.507
If you die outside the mirror

51:33.651 --> 51:36.950
you can still be living within

51:37.555 --> 51:40.683
Also, if the you
in the mirror dies,

51:40.792 --> 51:42.919
you see no reflection

52:01.879 --> 52:04.473
Do you see someone
else in the mirror too?
