WEBVTT

00:15.473 --> 00:16.558
[woman] Found it.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.101
Looks like y'all are ready for Halloween.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.854
Oh, it is my favorite. [chuckles]

00:21.604 --> 00:25.442
I use dry ice to make the house
extra spooky for the young 'uns.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.611
-Not from around here, are you?
-What was my tell?

00:28.695 --> 00:31.573
-Well, that accent, for one. [chuckles]
-Guilty.

00:31.656 --> 00:34.451
-What brings you to Pikeville?
-Oh, I'm just passing through.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.829
Funny how a town
I've spent my entire life in

00:37.912 --> 00:39.998
is just a rest stop for most.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.167
Have a nice day, now.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.002
Thank you.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.104
[Tom] <i>Hannah Wells...</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:08.568
saved this country and my own life

01:09.736 --> 01:12.530
more times than should ever
have been necessary.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.243
And given everything that I owed her,
I have to be honest.

01:19.537 --> 01:22.332
Personally, I can't tell you
that I knew her very well.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.752
I always figured...

01:27.837 --> 01:29.464
there would be time for that.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.260
But as I stand here today,
I can tell you what I do know.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.515
She served this country
with a kind of passion and commitment

01:38.598 --> 01:40.767
that is unparalleled in my eyes.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.522
The kind of commitment that led her
to make the ultimate sacrifice.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.068
She will be missed...

01:52.070 --> 01:55.949
by me, her friends and her family.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.707
<i>Ave atque vale, </i>Agent Wells.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.127
I salute you.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.462
[sighs]

02:13.424 --> 02:15.093
I am so sorry for your loss.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.809
Sir.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.688
Deputy Director Lewis,

02:26.771 --> 02:29.899
I understand that POTUS put you in charge
of the Momberg investigation.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.987
I'm heading up a fusion center
coordinating a dozen warring agencies.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.947
No one else wanted the job.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.576
I want you to meet that bioweapons expert
I told you about, Dr. Mays.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.870
OPM set him up
with a temporary appointment.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.038
Our people out of Quantico
deal with germ warfare.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.291
Actually, it's bioterrorism, sir.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.835
Nothing like warfare.
Nothing like anyone's dealt with before.

02:48.918 --> 02:49.878
All right, talk to me.

02:49.961 --> 02:53.631
Wouter Momberg,
a South African apartheid-era scientist,

02:53.715 --> 02:56.050
is taking advantage of breakthroughs
in gene editing

02:56.134 --> 02:58.011
to accomplish
what he couldn't back in the '80s.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.556
He's CRISPR'ed together a virus targeting
people with dark-skin pigmentation:

03:01.639 --> 03:03.016
blacks, Arabs, Latinos.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.685
We sent his picture to every
law enforcement agency in the country.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.313
And I've put out feelers
to do-it-yourself labs across the US.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.316
So we're looking for a mad scientist
with genocidal intent.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.901
We have no idea where he is.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.402
I checked Genetical's records,

03:14.485 --> 03:18.031
the company that supplied Momberg
with the DNA he was using. It turns out...

03:18.114 --> 03:20.825
[Aaron] There was an attempted delivery
of genetic material to the brewery

03:20.909 --> 03:21.868
the day after it burned down.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.202
How does that help us?

03:23.286 --> 03:26.331
This morning, another company
delivered the same genetic sequence

03:26.414 --> 03:28.333
to a post office in Pikeville, Tennessee.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.960
-Did we pick up his trail?
-It took too long to mobilize.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.212
The Tennessee Highway Patrol
had a bad reaction

03:33.296 --> 03:34.505
to the feds telling them what to do.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.883
And the turf wars begin. God damn it.

03:36.966 --> 03:40.470
-This genetic sequence, what does it do?
-It's hard to know without more context.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.930
Get me some context now.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.308
The fact that he's willing to risk
getting caught by picking up a package

03:45.391 --> 03:47.268
suggests that he is not going underground.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.021
Which means we have to be prepared
for the possibility

03:50.104 --> 03:52.607
of a very real, very imminent
bioterrorist attack.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.068
-What's the playbook for this?
-We're writing it.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.821
We do have contingency plans in place
for conventional bio attacks,

03:58.905 --> 04:02.325
but the threat of rogue biologists
creating incurable designer diseases--

04:02.408 --> 04:04.118
Is something
we've never had to deal with before.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.162
-The technology didn't exist.
-[Aaron] Until now.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.413
For a couple of thousand bucks,

04:07.497 --> 04:11.376
an amateur scientist can produce a plague
that could wipe out all of humanity.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.254
Except this son of a bitch
isn't going after all of humanity.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
Just the swarthier set.
Who do we need to tell?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.591
-The fewer the better.
-[Tom] Not necessarily.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.095
This threat is gonna require
massive interagency cooperation.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.390
I've relieved Dianne Lewis
of her responsibilities at the CIA

04:25.473 --> 04:27.809
so she can help us coordinate a response
from the Situation Room.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.893
Should we tell the press?

04:28.977 --> 04:32.105
We don't know what Momberg's gonna do,
and he doesn't know what we know.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.815
We can't have them broadcasting that.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.734
I'll have Lorraine cancel
all the campaign obligations.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.821
No, I think we need to proceed
as if everything is normal.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.782
I have my major TV endorsement
from the unions later today.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.909
If I don't attend that, that'll be noted.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.703
That's all for now. Thank you, everyone.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.080
Aaron.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.041
[sighs]

04:53.751 --> 04:56.754
-Are we gonna catch this guy?
-Sooner or later.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.506
But in time to stop him?

04:58.589 --> 05:02.010
And I thought averting
last week's nuclear threat was a triumph.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.054
Makes me long for the days
of mutually assured destruction.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.473
At least then we knew
who our enemies were.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.642
Now anyone
with a little bit of scientific knowledge

05:09.726 --> 05:10.893
can unleash Armageddon.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.687
It's hard not to be afraid, sir.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.025
You'd be a fool not to be. Thank you.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.443
Sir.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.867
[theme music playing]

05:36.794 --> 05:39.881
Ten days before the election, I'm busier
than a whorehouse on nickel night.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.007
This better be good.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.176
-Got a heads-up from a reporter.
-[Lorraine] Mmm-hmm.

05:43.259 --> 05:47.305
There's gonna be a story tonight
that implicates Moss.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.682
Okay, and?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.727
When Garrett Detwiler
was Moss' FDA commissioner,

05:52.810 --> 05:56.481
he rubber-stamped the approval
of FlagKind's prescription painkiller.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.482
So what?

05:57.565 --> 06:01.069
FlagKind and the FDA knew
how addictive it was,

06:01.152 --> 06:02.862
and they pushed it through anyway.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.031
-Where did you get this?
-Does it matter?

06:05.114 --> 06:07.617
You don't usually color
outside the lines, Mars.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.287
But when you do, God damn it,
[whispers] it's sort of arousing.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.497
Fuckers had it coming.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.751
Did Moss know about the FDA
pushing the opioid through?

06:16.834 --> 06:17.710
Who cares?

06:17.794 --> 06:20.254
If it happens under your administration,
it's your problem.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.800
You should care, because you took
the president to Detwiler's fundraiser

06:23.883 --> 06:25.593
and encouraged him to take dark money.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.136
Or have we forgotten that tiny detail?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.598
No, that money was used to pay
striking teachers' salaries.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.726
The Moss administration uncorked
the opioid epidemic.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.021
He is as good as guilty,
so I need these new ads to just...

06:37.105 --> 06:39.982
[grunts] grab him
by the nut sack and twist.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.275
Not a visual I needed.

06:41.359 --> 06:45.196
And I want them running everywhere
right up until the polls close,

06:45.279 --> 06:46.656
online and on television,

06:46.739 --> 06:50.326
especially in the Rust Belt,
where opioid addiction is just rampant.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.620
We gotta turn
some of these red states gold.

06:52.703 --> 06:53.913
I'll assign it to Dontae and his team.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.374
Meanwhile, the latest data from the GOTV

06:56.457 --> 06:59.001
says that West Virginia
is definitely still going to Moss.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.505
Yeah, but now we've got a chance
at Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.174
I think there's a real chance
that we flip New York.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.759
We got a home-court advantage.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.887
Okay, but we really need Florida
if we even want a chance.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.390
[Lorraine] Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.308
I can't imagine it gets any crazier.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.644
[Lorraine] Emily, I've been wondering...

07:16.727 --> 07:19.272
You ever think
about what you're gonna do next?

07:19.355 --> 07:20.398
After November 5th?

07:20.481 --> 07:24.152
Take care of my mom, sleep.
Travel, maybe. Who knows?

07:24.235 --> 07:26.779
I'll be sipping a Miami Vice
on a Caribbean island.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.239
Sounds lovely.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.907
If we can pull off this win,

07:29.991 --> 07:33.161
maybe I should take
a cushy corporate consulting gig,

07:33.244 --> 07:35.455
leave my career in politics on top.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.039
I don't buy that for a second.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.042
-You get off on this.
-Yeah, you're right. I do.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.753
Winning, it's everything. It's my life.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.673
I think you get off on it, too.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.800
Have you ever considered
staying in the game?

07:47.884 --> 07:51.596
An interesting special senatorial election
is coming up in Virginia.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.389
You should think about it.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.144
Sixteen intelligence agencies.
How do we get them all on the same page?

07:58.227 --> 08:01.481
Secretary Wolenick from Homeland
will coordinate the FBI response.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.982
Good, they're not happy with me.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.902
The director of National Intelligence
doesn't want ownership.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.321
It's too politically charged
this close to the election.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.198
-You'll wrangle the Security Council.
-[Aaron] Done.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.909
What about the Office of Terrorism
and Financial Intelligence?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.827
An operation like this
would need major funding.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.913
I'll communicate with Treasury,
work on the money flow.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.539
I need you to brief the gang of eight.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.916
I don't know if that's a good idea.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.083
We have a responsibility here.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.294
I don't want Congress
hearing about this after the fact.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.046
-I need you to do it.
-Yes, sir.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.883
Anybody gives you any resistance,
send them to me. Let's get moving.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.636
[Emily] We need people
currently suffering from opioid addiction

08:31.719 --> 08:33.387
and those in recovery.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.431
All ages, races and economic classes.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.892
This is all a little crass, no?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.687
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.691
Oh, Lorraine asked me
what my plans for the future are.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.692
So?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.986
Between taking care of my mom
and working on the campaign,

08:49.070 --> 08:51.822
I haven't even thought
about what comes next.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.117
Which is insane, because two years ago,
all I thought about was the future.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.412
I'll either be back at the EEOB
dreaming about hashtags,

08:58.496 --> 09:00.540
or at the unemployment line.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.458
That's not true. The president likes you,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
and he's seen how instrumental
you've been to the campaign.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.795
He'll take care of you.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.046
[chuckles]

09:07.129 --> 09:09.799
How's everything else?
I haven't heard much about Troy lately.

09:09.882 --> 09:10.883
Fire still burning?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.220
Things are complicated.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.430
Welcome to my world.
All the good ones are.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.224
-[phone ringing]
-I need those right away, please.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.393
[phone beeps]

09:22.853 --> 09:24.438
[door opens]

09:24.522 --> 09:26.148
[liquids gurgling]

09:26.983 --> 09:28.568
Oh. Uh, hi.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.571
Hello, miss. Beautiful morning, isn't it?

09:32.947 --> 09:36.534
Sorry, uh, I'm just used to having
the place to myself this early.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.827
[typing]

09:37.910 --> 09:40.705
-You at Ole Miss?
-Visiting researcher from Rochester.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.540
I didn't know
we had an exchange with them.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.791
I'm the first.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.252
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.714
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.715
[continues typing]

09:51.674 --> 09:54.969
My desk is over there,
so, uh, I'm gonna go.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.096
Okay. Yeah.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.910
So the problem we're having
making an accurate risk assessment

10:19.994 --> 10:20.995
is identifying his targets.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.164
Sir, we've gamed out these scenarios.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.791
If we get a clearer idea
of what the virus is,

10:25.875 --> 10:27.877
we can distribute treatment
through postal workers.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.754
We'd have to develop a treatment first.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.298
What's the plan to evacuate people
from infected areas?

10:32.381 --> 10:33.799
There is no plan, sir.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
[scoffs] Shouldn't that be
our first priority?

10:36.218 --> 10:38.721
In the case of a nuclear
or chemical attack, yes.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.223
But when a disease
is introduced into the population,

10:41.307 --> 10:44.143
the infected become
a vector of transmission.

10:45.102 --> 10:48.105
They're weaponized,
and we'll have to quarantine them.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.359
So you're saying if this disease hits,
one that targets people of color,

10:51.442 --> 10:53.194
I'll be condemning the infected to death?

10:53.277 --> 10:54.195
Yeah.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.578
What is that? Is that algae?

11:04.538 --> 11:05.706
Good eyes.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.834
OMG, I wish I understood genetics.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.922
I just don't have the head for it.
I'm a chem girl all the way.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.256
[chuckling] Okay.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.593
I'm gonna grab a coffee. Do you want one?

11:17.676 --> 11:18.969
Oh, no, thank you.

11:19.929 --> 11:20.846
Okay.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.238
[line rings]

11:37.321 --> 11:39.740
<i>-You have reached the voice-mail box of...</i>
-Come on.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.783
[Eli] <i>Eli Mays.</i>

11:40.866 --> 11:44.995
Eli, that guy you posted about is here.
He's doing biosynth.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.457
From what I could tell, something to do
with a segment of norovirus.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.584
And you know my thesis.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.670
I... I...

11:52.753 --> 11:56.340
Wait, I think he might have left.
But you can track him--

11:57.007 --> 11:59.593
Hey! Get off me.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.096
[grunting]

12:03.889 --> 12:05.766
[Tom] The FBI playing nice
with Homeland Security?

12:05.850 --> 12:09.145
Barely. I'm directing the NSA
to sift through highway cam footage.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.604
[man] Dr. Mays has some information.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.942
We have a lead.
Our DIY guy just got a call

12:15.025 --> 12:18.446
placing Momberg at a lab in Oxford,
Mississippi, near the university.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.198
This DIY scientist with all the intel,
why the hell isn't he here?

12:21.282 --> 12:23.576
-There was a question of clearance, sir.
-[Tom] I don't give a shit.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.411
Get him in here now.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.874
You can't expect Congress to keep quiet
about a threat like this, Mars.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.794
With all due respect, Speaker,
Title 50 requires that you do just that.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.589
This is a stunt to postpone the election.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.966
I assure you, Senator,
this is no such thing.

12:39.049 --> 12:43.262
POTUS wanted to inform you, so that you,
as congressional leadership,

12:43.345 --> 12:47.141
can coordinate a calm, measured response
when the time comes.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.393
What is the calm, measured response
for bioterrorism?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.146
-Anything but this.
-So what are we telling the public?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.481
We say nothing for now.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.399
All information flows
from the White House.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.568
I have a duty to inform my caucus.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.694
[Mars] This gets out,

12:58.777 --> 13:02.740
people are gonna start panicking
every time someone coughs at a Starbucks.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.408
We say nothing.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.535
I have an election in ten days.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.747
If the press found out I knew
and didn't say anything...

13:09.830 --> 13:12.666
You go public with this,
then I go public with the fact

13:12.750 --> 13:16.170
that your first thought
in the face of a terrorist threat

13:16.253 --> 13:19.882
was your reelection,
not the safety of your constituents.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.759
You leak, I plug you.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.514
-Mr. President, Dr. Eli Mays.
-Dr. Mays, what have you got for us?

13:26.597 --> 13:29.517
A colleague out of Mississippi
said she saw Momberg at her lab.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.353
-He was doing something with norovirus.
-Why norovirus?

13:32.436 --> 13:35.147
He needs to infect as many people
as quickly as possible.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.566
Airborne delivery doesn't reach
enough people fast enough,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.485
but norovirus can survive in water.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.861
[Dianne] The only reason for him to use it

13:40.945 --> 13:43.239
would be to hit
an entire population center at once.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.908
What provisions do we have in place
if he attacks a water supply?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.618
We could trigger an asset protection plan.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.829
Reach out to the National Guard
to protect reservoirs, treatment plants,

13:50.913 --> 13:53.791
coordinate with first responders
on the ground to check for contaminants.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.960
One call, we could mobilize
by the end of day.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.169
Show me.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.967
Any of those reservoirs
could be his target.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.345
Or none of them. What routes
could he have taken from the brewery?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.556
To Pikeville to Oxford, Mississippi.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.605
What's your call, Mr. President?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.989
It's about time.
Do you have anything for me?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.407
[door closes]

14:26.490 --> 14:29.451
Good afternoon. I'm doing great.
Thanks for asking.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.371
Okay, there's no time
for pleasantries, Myles.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.915
Is there anything about FlagKind?

14:34.999 --> 14:38.335
Well, after I spent hours
scrubbing through recordings

14:38.419 --> 14:42.631
from Moss' computer and cell phone,
I found it, yes.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.386
[Phil] <i>Cornelius, we can spin this. </i>

14:47.469 --> 14:49.889
<i>I'm sure the FDA under Kirkman</i>
<i>has some skeletons of their own.</i>

14:49.972 --> 14:51.557
<i>-We just have to dig them up.</i>
-[chuckling]

14:52.141 --> 14:53.058
Yeah.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.520
He wants to infect
as many people as possible.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.982
If we move to protect Mississippi
and we're wrong,

15:00.065 --> 15:01.817
our mobilization will tip him off.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.319
He'll just move somewhere else and strike.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.862
But he is in Mississippi now,

15:04.945 --> 15:07.031
a state that's nearly
40% African-American.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.491
I don't think it's his final destination.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.785
Nashville, Memphis, they're too small.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.205
That leaves New Orleans,
Houston, possibly Dallas.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.166
Mr. President, every minute we wait

15:17.249 --> 15:19.043
raises the chances
there'll be a death toll.

15:22.129 --> 15:26.175
I want the FBI monitoring assets
here, here and here.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.762
Get your first responders to every
major water source along that route.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.764
-Have them start testing for contaminants.
-On it.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.183
How do we get fresh water to people
if they need it?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.727
Isabel's office specializes
in clean water initiatives.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.853
Tell her we need help.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.856
Sir, now that we know
there could be something in the water,

15:40.940 --> 15:41.941
should we alert the public?

15:42.024 --> 15:45.444
No, I don't want to create mass hysteria.
Not when we're this close to finding him.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.154
I know the chance I'm taking.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.908
[police siren blaring]

15:53.327 --> 15:55.245
[Lorraine] There you are.
I was getting worried.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.958
AFL-CIO has been waiting for 20 minutes.
Are you ready?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.626
As ready as I'll ever be.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.630
Oh, brother. Get your head in the game, K.
Ten days until the election.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.424
We need labor
to get their members to turn out,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.843
which means wooing them with this speech.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.553
[Tom] Got it. Ready to woo.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.056
[Lorraine] Good,
there's a lot riding on this.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.642
Also, there's an article
coming out tonight

16:16.725 --> 16:21.689
about an unethical FDA opioid approval,
and it implicates Moss.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.023
Any risk for us?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.275
Oh, no, on the contrary,

16:25.359 --> 16:28.612
I think this is gonna give us
a really big boost in the polls.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.614
[Tom] Okay, good. Keep me informed.

16:30.698 --> 16:35.077
You know what?
Your excitement is just blowing my mind.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.453
[announcer] Ladies and gentleman,

16:36.537 --> 16:39.039
the president
of the United States of America.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.582
[crowd cheering]

16:42.584 --> 16:43.794
[exhales heavily]

16:44.670 --> 16:46.005
Let's get this over with.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.676
[crowd continues cheering]

16:50.759 --> 16:53.053
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a pleasure to be here.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.764
[knock on door]

16:58.475 --> 17:00.602
If you're here to beg for my forgiveness,
save it.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.272
-I'm here on official NSC business.
-Of course you are.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.484
I'm confused.
Do you want me to be here to beg?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.736
What do you need, Aaron?

17:09.653 --> 17:14.241
If drinking water were to be contaminated,
say with some kind of virus,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.119
what additional resources
would you have available?

17:17.202 --> 17:19.705
-We could give out LifeStraws.
-LifeStraws?

17:19.788 --> 17:24.001
Yeah, they filter out bacteria,
parasites and some viruses from water.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.211
We used them in the Congo
during the Ebola outbreak.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.296
And you can get these quickly?

17:27.379 --> 17:29.089
We could get about 10,000
with one phone call.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.007
How many would you need?

17:31.216 --> 17:32.217
Ten million.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.221
-You're shitting me.
-No.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.058
-What the fuck is going on, Aaron?
-I can't discuss it.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.734
Is that it?

17:50.611 --> 17:51.528
Okay.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.202
-Where are you staying?
-None of your business.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.370
So that's it?
You're just gonna pack up and leave?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.206
We're not even gonna try
to work through this?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.917
I will work on finding
ten million LifeStraws.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.044
You can shut the door behind you.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.094
[door closes]

18:18.639 --> 18:21.225
The lab in Mississippi turned up
nothing but a dead body.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.478
-No joy from the highway cams in the area.
-He's smarter than that.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.231
The press is hounding me.
They've picked up chatter from DIY--

18:27.314 --> 18:29.483
Seth, not right now.
Please, just handle it.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.529
I'm sorry about your friend.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.698
I knew her from conferences.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.161
She worked in nanorobotics,

18:41.745 --> 18:45.916
these crazy little machines
small enough to enter a cell.

18:47.835 --> 18:48.836
Her thesis.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.755
We can track him.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.676
My friend did her thesis at MIT
on smart dust,

18:55.759 --> 18:59.847
tiny nanites that can be tracked
via radio-frequency identification.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.974
I think she managed
to plant some on Momberg.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.183
Why do you think that?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.769
Her voice mail.
She said we could track him.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.062
I'll have our people check the lab.

19:07.980 --> 19:12.067
If she managed to put smart dust
on Momberg, we could set up trackers,

19:12.151 --> 19:16.905
tap into existing RFID devices,
antitheft sensors, toll booths.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.032
The radius would be limited,
but it's something.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
-What would it take?
-[Dianne] We have agents in the field,

19:20.909 --> 19:22.703
but we're talking
hundreds of thousands of trackers.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.706
If we were to focus all of our energy
on New Orleans, Houston and Dallas,

19:25.789 --> 19:27.416
would we have the resources to do this?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.668
If that's where he's heading.
And that's a big "if."

19:29.751 --> 19:32.421
-Would we have the resources?
-Yes, sir.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.339
Then, do it.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.553
[sighs]

19:44.558 --> 19:46.059
What the hell am I doing here?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.686
The best you can, sir.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.980
[sighs] I was walking backstage
at that union event

19:50.063 --> 19:53.525
and Lorraine was going on about some
opioid article that she was thrilled with,

19:53.609 --> 19:55.944
and all I could think about
was this madman

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
running around staging a genetic genocide.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.533
We've come a long way
from pressure-cooker bombs in backpacks.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.661
I'm just pretending like I know
what I'm doing.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.955
The truth is, I don't have a clue.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.293
Choosing not to notify the public,
not to engage law enforcement...

20:11.877 --> 20:15.380
I am guessing here.
And what if the smart dust doesn't work?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.257
This guy could strike anytime, anywhere.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.427
You're concerned about making
the wrong decisions.

20:20.510 --> 20:23.096
Any leader worth a damn would be.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.015
This is more than being concerned.

20:25.891 --> 20:30.270
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna have
the blood of thousands on my hands.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.898
There's nothing more we can do here.

20:37.027 --> 20:41.240
In the meantime, you need to get some rest
while you still have the opportunity.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.753
<i>My four-year-old and I</i>
<i>came home from church, </i>

20:55.712 --> 20:59.258
<i>and my husband was dead in the bathroom</i>
<i>of a heroin overdose.</i>

20:59.341 --> 21:00.384
[Troy] You working late?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.223
If your plan is to pretend
like nothing happened,

21:06.306 --> 21:07.474
you need a better plan.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.484
[Troy] Look, I don't have a plan.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.779
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.074
Okay.

21:24.157 --> 21:28.328
You know, after you told me,
I ran to get tested.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.914
I was freaking out.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.335
And my very gruff and very gay doctor

21:36.044 --> 21:38.755
told me there was no chance
that I was infected.

21:40.132 --> 21:44.761
There was no reason for me
to react like I did.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.721
I told you that.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.974
I understand all that,
but I'm still afraid.

21:50.767 --> 21:55.564
And I'm still upset that you didn't
trust me enough to be upfront.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.691
But you could've brought it up.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.110
You're right.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.779
That's on me.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.490
Look, I am sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.994
When I think about everything
you have to go through,

22:10.370 --> 22:13.665
how people treat you, how I treated you,

22:13.749 --> 22:16.293
why did I think
that you owed me an explanation?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.128
I get it, though.

22:20.464 --> 22:24.426
You think I'm not scared,
having a disease that's killed millions?

22:24.509 --> 22:27.471
You are gonna lead a long and happy life.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.639
No, you don't know that.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.394
I told you that first night...

22:36.229 --> 22:38.106
I'm not done kissing you yet.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.526
And my doctor...

22:42.819 --> 22:46.281
gave me a prescription for PrEP.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.493
So what? You want, like, a gold star?

22:50.285 --> 22:52.621
Maybe just a second chance.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.921
You know,

23:02.464 --> 23:06.843
you never did get to try
my mama's hot-water cornbread.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.096
You baked for me?

23:09.179 --> 23:12.474
-You fry it, city mouse, in a skillet.
-[chuckles]

23:12.557 --> 23:13.517
[chuckles]

23:33.161 --> 23:35.330
Who knows what tomorrow brings?

23:37.332 --> 23:42.754
But I know I don't want
to waste my time being afraid.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.559
How you doing, Mom?

23:55.642 --> 23:58.895
How do you think I'm feeling?
I'm waiting for the Grim Reaper.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.355
Don't say that.

24:00.438 --> 24:04.860
Okay. I'm waiting to walk
into a great beam of light

24:04.943 --> 24:07.237
at the Pearly Gates. Better?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.073
Are you hungry?
Can I make you something to eat?

24:10.157 --> 24:12.576
-No.
-You have to keep your strength up.

24:12.659 --> 24:17.414
Emily, I'm dying.
Don't be so stubborn about this.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.708
I am trying, Mom, but it is...

24:20.584 --> 24:22.085
It's not easy. And I...

24:24.129 --> 24:26.381
I just... [sighs]
I keep thinking that...

24:26.965 --> 24:29.885
You know, what if I'd gone
to the NIH sooner?

24:29.968 --> 24:33.805
[voice breaking] Or what if I didn't
come back and work on the campaign?

24:33.889 --> 24:37.017
-Things would be different. You would--
-Just stop.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.768
[crying]

24:40.979 --> 24:42.772
None of this is your fault.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.568
There isn't anything
you could've done to prevent it.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.988
And I need you to support me on this.

24:50.947 --> 24:55.160
And I need to know you're gonna be okay,
that you'll survive when I'm gone.

24:55.243 --> 24:59.331
[voice breaking] You have to promise
you will hold my hand...

25:01.166 --> 25:02.667
and you will let me go.

25:03.793 --> 25:04.794
[crying]

25:08.298 --> 25:10.050
I promise. [sniffles]

[reporter on TV] <i>Was this</i>
<i>a dirty campaign trick</i>

25:15.180 --> 25:16.932
<i>-from President Kirkman's camp?</i>
-No.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.058
<i>It's no coincidence</i>

25:18.141 --> 25:21.770
<i>this years-old information came out</i>

25:21.853 --> 25:22.938
[reporter] <i>It's alarming, nonetheless.</i>

25:23.021 --> 25:25.899
<i>We all believed former President Moss</i>

<i>Either he turned a blind eye</i>

25:29.194 --> 25:30.695

25:30.779 --> 25:32.572
<i>Neither sounds presidential to me.</i>

25:32.656 --> 25:34.658
That is so fucking true.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.619
[exhales] And...

25:39.037 --> 25:43.250
another marriage down the drain.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.257
[sighs]

25:51.633 --> 25:53.218
That stellar of a day?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.428
You can't even imagine.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.265
Can you talk about it?

25:58.932 --> 26:02.394
Or is it one of those "I can't discuss
White House business" things?

26:02.477 --> 26:03.687
[sighs]

26:03.770 --> 26:07.691
There's a huge threat
to national security.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.318
A lot of people could get hurt.

26:11.194 --> 26:16.032
I haven't a clue as to what to advise
the president to do about it.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.452
I'm scared out of my mind.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.914
Well, if there's one thing
I know about you,

26:22.998 --> 26:24.791
it's that you always come through.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.086
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.629
This will be no different.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.591
I'm glad you're home.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.724
It was you, wasn't it?

26:41.683 --> 26:45.270
The high-ranking government official
who leaked to the press.

26:49.274 --> 26:53.445
I almost lost you, Lynn.
I had to do something about it.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.947
So you risked your job?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.199
It was the right thing to do.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.081
Besides, you know how easy it is
to leak from within the swamp.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.421
Thank you, for doing this,
for letting me in.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.006
It's a nice change.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.218
And it's kind of a turn-on.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.904
-[Sasha] Hi.
-Hey.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.072
Rough day?

28:20.573 --> 28:24.994
Worst kind, where every decision you make
could lead to an incredible disaster.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.622
Isn't that every day for the president?

28:28.665 --> 28:31.000
Not all disasters are created equal.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.211
You wouldn't know it
from how people in this town react

28:33.294 --> 28:35.130
when someone wears a tan suit.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.297
[Tom chuckles]

28:40.760 --> 28:43.054
For me, the worst thing
about being president...

28:44.889 --> 28:47.976
It doesn't matter how many
great advisors you have around you.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.269
At the end of the day...

28:50.061 --> 28:51.855
[sighs] it's down to you.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.442
And when you're done, you come back here,

28:55.525 --> 28:58.778
to this place
that's supposed to be a home.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.782
And I still...

29:04.409 --> 29:07.412
You still expect
to find Alex waiting for you.

29:08.288 --> 29:13.042
Every goddamn day.
And all I get is this empty room.

29:13.960 --> 29:18.631
That emptiness never goes away.
I feel it, too.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.595
I know I'm not my sister.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.056
God knows I don't have her patience.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.560
Or her ability to pull off
a pantsuit. [chuckles]

29:31.269 --> 29:32.270
[chuckles]

29:33.354 --> 29:35.190
But I'm here for you, Tom.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.278
Thank you, Sasha. I mean it, thank you.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.993
Okay, good night.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.003
Hello? Anyone in there?

29:59.047 --> 30:00.131
[Seth] What are you doing?

30:01.341 --> 30:02.425
[Isabel] I'm trying to get in.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.178
I think it's safe to say
there's nobody in there.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.638
Nice stilettos, by the way.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.307
Shut up. They're pumps.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.559
And I didn't think anyone else
would be here this early.

30:12.143 --> 30:16.773
The GSA is usually here by now.
I cannot be reduced to taking a ho bath.

30:16.856 --> 30:17.816
"A ho bath"?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.153
You stay in the West Wing
with Aaron last night?

30:25.698 --> 30:27.116
You guys got into a fight.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.161
We broke up.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.832
Oh, shit. What did he do?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.542
I don't wanna get into it.

30:36.417 --> 30:40.255
I moved out, and into my office.
Temporarily.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.675
You've taken up residency in the EEOB?
That's crazy.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.177
I have a couch
that feels like a cumulus cloud.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.847
-You'll stay with me.
-No, I can't.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.849
-[keys jingling]
-Finally.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.644
You can and you will.
It'll be like a middle-school sleepover.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.480
You had girls coming over
to your sleepover in middle school?

31:10.618 --> 31:13.288
<i>It's heroin.</i>
<i>Of course the manufacturers know that.</i>

31:13.371 --> 31:15.498

<i>They just need so much more love.</i>

-[sighs] So what'd you think?
-It's good. Release it.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.998
Add a photo of Moss' ugly mug
to the next one.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.541
And I want a voice-over that says,

31:58.625 --> 32:01.920
"His name is Cornelius Moss,
and he approved this drug."

32:02.003 --> 32:05.006
-Wow. Not pulling any punches.
-We need to be ready with the big guns.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.716
I have a feeling that Moss' team

32:06.799 --> 32:09.344
is gonna go through FDA approvals
under Kirkman.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.803
Why would you think that?

32:10.887 --> 32:12.722
It's called gaming the possibilities,
sweetie.

32:12.805 --> 32:16.225
I've been doing this a long time.
It's what I would do if I were them.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.187
Let's find anything questionable
and prepare statements.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.773
-I'll reach out to the FDA.
-Get Isabel's help.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.404

from a hard drive

32:37.580 --> 32:39.499
recovered after the brewery fire.

32:39.582 --> 32:43.920
They confirmed that Momberg was
working with our trail of dead scientists.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.089
He's the mastermind.

32:46.172 --> 32:49.092
It looks that way,
except Treasury found huge sums

32:49.175 --> 32:53.096
wired to the brewery over the past year
from a shell corp in Delaware.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.514
Is this a mercenary job?

32:54.597 --> 32:58.184
No, this is his life's work.
He has a patron.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.186
A wealthy American, by the look of it.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.730
I'm heading to the Situation Room.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.316
Aaron, come with me.
Mars, hold down the fort.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.776
[Seth] Sir, I spoke to the CDC.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.569
They said the more information
the public has

33:08.653 --> 33:10.113
before something happens, the better.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.532
Well, I'm sorry,
we don't have any information.

33:12.615 --> 33:15.368
I could put out some guidance
under the guise of flu prevention.

Coughing into your elbow,
frequent handwashing.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.789
Seth, water might be
how this thing spreads.

33:19.872 --> 33:23.042
Okay, so not that, but we have to say
something, Mr. President.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.503
I'm sorry, it's too soon.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.214
Sir, maybe if you and your kids
were being targeted,

33:28.297 --> 33:30.925
-you might feel differently.
-[Mars] You're out of line.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.469
No, say what you've gotta say.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.348
Momberg's plan doesn't target
anyone in this room except me.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.601
And from where I stand,
I'm sorry, sir, I...

33:41.352 --> 33:43.688
I can't help but wonder
if maybe it's easier

33:43.771 --> 33:47.066
taking a chance on someone's life
when they don't look like you.

33:48.192 --> 33:52.238
Seth, I understand how you might think
I'm taking this less personally than you,

33:52.321 --> 33:56.200
but I am responsible for the safety
and security of every American citizen.

33:56.284 --> 33:59.412
I took an oath to that effect,
and I didn't take it lightly.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.831
We don't know
what we're dealing with here.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.792
We don't know if hand sanitizer
helps this stuff grow

34:04.876 --> 34:07.545
or if it has an affinity
for the cotton in breathing masks.

34:07.628 --> 34:11.466
The only chance we've got
is to capture this monster,

34:11.549 --> 34:13.301

-This better not be about water.
-Water? No, uh...

Lorraine wants me
to look into FDA drug approvals

34:46.709 --> 34:48.127
under the president's governance.

34:48.211 --> 34:51.297
-That sounds like a campaign issue.
-Technically, it is.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.466
But if the Moss campaign
gets this information before we do,

34:53.549 --> 34:55.468
it could also be
attacking the administration.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.054
So you want me to violate the Hatch Act

34:58.137 --> 35:01.265
to help you and Lorraine
beat Moss at his own game?

35:01.349 --> 35:02.934
In simple terms, yes.

35:03.017 --> 35:05.812
-Well, in simple terms, no.
-Is something wrong?

35:08.314 --> 35:11.943
Emily, you can drop the pretense.
I know what's up.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.361
Excuse me?

35:14.070 --> 35:16.114
Don't fucking bullshit me.

I just drove two hours

35:34.632 --> 35:37.260

were monitoring our video chat.

I have no time for drinks

35:39.762 --> 35:40.763
Okay.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.474
I had a visitor in my lab last year.

35:43.558 --> 35:47.478
He was very Waspy.
Skinny legs, painful sting.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.690

35:50.773 --> 35:52.942

population subgroups.

35:53.025 --> 35:55.027
And this wasn't a red flag how?

35:55.111 --> 35:56.404
I said no, obviously.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.282
Pretty bananas, the sum of money
he was offering.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.033
-Did you catch his name?
-He never told me.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.245
My point is that even though I said no,
doesn't mean everyone else will.

36:04.912 --> 36:08.207
Momberg? He's on this guy's payroll?

36:08.291 --> 36:11.127
An exiled scientist
doesn't have the dough to pull this off.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.588
Not without help from someone
higher up in the food chain.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.594
Can you believe the campaign wants me
to dig through Kirkman's FDA approvals?

36:19.677 --> 36:21.387
-Do it.
-I'm sorry, what?

36:21.470 --> 36:23.723
Looking into the president
doesn't defy the Hatch Act.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.516
Collaborate with the campaign on this one.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.977
Due respect, sir, but why are you
suddenly being so accommodating?

36:28.060 --> 36:30.938
FlagKind is exactly
what pharma shouldn't be.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.065
They're worse
than the dealers on the corner,

36:33.149 --> 36:35.193
disguising addiction as healing.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.487
-So this is about your wife?
-I have an axe to grind, yes.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.698
And I wanna put it
right through their fucking heads.

36:40.781 --> 36:41.699
Understood.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.368
I'm glad someone's finally bringing
companies like this down,

36:44.452 --> 36:46.204
but it's a little messed up,
don't you think?

36:46.287 --> 36:47.205
Which part?

36:47.288 --> 36:50.124
People of color have been
battling addiction for decades.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.002
All we get is the war on drugs
and a prison sentence.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.963
It isn't until white folks start dying
that things change.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.132
No offense.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.301
You're right.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.595
I like working with you.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.889
You say what you mean
and you mean what you say.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.934
That is a good quality in this game.
Don't lose it.

37:10.811 --> 37:13.397
He's in Houston.
We got a ping on the smart dust.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.566
I've coordinated with the local PD,

37:15.650 --> 37:17.944
and they're tapping into RFID sensors
all across the city.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.112
The whole town is one big detection grid.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.531
-What did you tell them?
-We're searching for a child kidnapper.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.493
Aaron, inform the governor
and the mayor on the situation.

37:25.576 --> 37:29.205
Texas is a Republican stronghold
and Moss' home state.

37:29.288 --> 37:32.041
Whatever we tell the governor,
it's going to come back to him.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.709
Then we beat them to the punch.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.295
We brief the Moss and Porter campaign
as well.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.838
They're not gonna mess with us here.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.299
This isn't political.
This is a national emergency.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.722
Felix? Yeah, get Phil Brunton
and Sophia Chase

37:46.806 --> 37:49.225
from the Moss and Porter campaign
in immediately.

37:49.308 --> 37:52.228
Seth, set up that press conference
you've been waiting for.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.814
We're gonna catch this bastard.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.655
[alarm blaring]

38:10.913 --> 38:13.916
Sorry about that, sir.
It's been malfunctioning all day.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.210
I can get you checked in right over here.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.962
-Thank you, son.
-Of course.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.673
Nearly scared an old man half to death.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.466
[chuckles]

38:24.302 --> 38:25.720
[clears throat]

38:26.762 --> 38:28.764
[operator] <i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

38:28.848 --> 38:31.392
So you're telling us there's
a credible bioterrorism threat

38:31.475 --> 38:32.852
in the nation's fourth-largest city?

38:32.935 --> 38:34.186
More than credible, yes.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.355
And we're not allowed
to say anything about it?

38:36.439 --> 38:39.942
This is not a political issue, Sophia.
It is national security.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.569
[Sophia] So Porter's supposed
to sit on his hands

38:41.652 --> 38:44.030
while you go in with guns blazing
and save the world?

38:44.113 --> 38:46.532
That's page one
out of the reelection handbook.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.200
President Kirkman
doesn't play by the book.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.744
They all play by the book.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.245
Phil, what do you think?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.165
I think we should give them
the benefit of the doubt.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.338
You'll have plenty of time to spin this
when it's all over.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.797
Provided we're still here.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.591
Thank you.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.094
I didn't expect you to be so reasonable.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.013
Doesn't exactly fit your reputation.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.389
Country before party.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.357
-What did the governor say?
-See for yourself, sir.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.526
<i>We were made aware of the threat</i>
<i>only moments ago,</i>

39:22.610 --> 39:24.779
<i>and we were told to keep our mouths shut.</i>

39:24.862 --> 39:27.156
<i>But unlike President Kirkman</i>
<i>and his cronies, </i>

39:27.239 --> 39:30.743
<i>I believe our constituents have a right</i>
<i>to know when their lives are in danger.</i>

39:30.826 --> 39:34.580
<i>So in consultation with President Moss,</i>
<i>I decided to inform the public.</i>

39:34.663 --> 39:35.831
Are you kidding me?

39:35.915 --> 39:38.626
Get me the governor and the mayor
back on the line now.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.294
[phone beeps]

39:50.304 --> 39:51.514
Governor, what the hell were you thinking?

39:51.597 --> 39:53.224
Do you have any idea what you've done?

39:53.307 --> 39:54.642
<i>I was well within my rights.</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:56.143
No, sir, you were not!

39:56.227 --> 40:00.147
That was classified information
I gave you out of respect to your office.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.859
That political stunt that you just pulled
may have tipped off our suspect

40:03.943 --> 40:06.278
and will cause widespread panic
across your state.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.406
<i>-We have it under control.</i>
-No, sir, you don't.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.075
What you're gonna have
is riots in the street over bottled water,

40:11.158 --> 40:12.118
you son of a bitch.

40:12.201 --> 40:15.204
<i>Mr. President, what's the plan here?</i>
<i>My city's in danger.</i>

40:15.287 --> 40:18.374
The plan was to capture the guy.
If we fail to do that now,

40:18.457 --> 40:20.543
we have measures in place
to quarantine your city.

40:20.626 --> 40:23.254
<i>Quarantine a city</i>
<i>of six and a half million?</i>

40:23.337 --> 40:25.256
We have the National Guard standing by.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.925
<i>Like hell you do.</i>
<i>I command the National Guard in my state.</i>

40:28.008 --> 40:29.218
No, you don't, Governor.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.512
My authority supersedes yours
in this matter.

40:31.595 --> 40:35.099
And because of what you've done,
we have to consider invoking martial law.

40:35.182 --> 40:38.978
<i>"Martial law"? You can't be serious.</i>
<i>It's been 100 years since--</i>

40:39.061 --> 40:41.689
<i>You are the poster boy</i>
<i>for government overreach.</i>

40:41.772 --> 40:43.023
<i>-We will fight you on this.</i>
-[Dianne] Mr. President.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.316
Excuse me.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.238
We're closing in on him.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.799
[agent] Sir, come with me please.
This way.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.025
-[agent 1] Freeze!
-[agent 2] Drop the bag!

41:27.485 --> 41:28.736
Drop the bag.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.073
I said drop the bag now!

41:33.157 --> 41:36.160
Fifty years of working
for the betterment of mankind,

41:36.243 --> 41:40.915
only to meet an ignoble end
in some cheap hotel

41:40.998 --> 41:43.417
at the hands of lesser men.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.793
But don't worry.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.546
My work will go on.

41:47.630 --> 41:48.631
I said drop it!

41:49.757 --> 41:51.133
[Momberg] Your days are numbered.

41:51.759 --> 41:56.764
Pandora's box is open, and her demons
will reshape the face of this earth,

41:56.847 --> 42:00.142
and I will forever be known
as the one who unleashed them.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.228
[coughing]

42:05.689 --> 42:06.690
Cyanide.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.402
Won't be long now.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.616
[agent 2] Let's get a medic!

42:18.077 --> 42:20.454
[agent 3 over phone] <i>Subject is down,</i>
<i>medic attending.</i>

42:20.538 --> 42:21.872
<i>The subject is unresponsive.</i>

42:21.956 --> 42:23.374
We got him. He's dead.

42:25.751 --> 42:26.752
Great work.

42:27.962 --> 42:28.963
Great work.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.055
Madam Mayor,
it is with honor that I tell you

42:38.138 --> 42:40.474
that the threat to your city
has been neutralized.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.309
<i>Mr. President, I demand to know--</i>

42:42.893 --> 42:45.854
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>
<i>Houston is in your debt.</i>

42:49.733 --> 42:50.943
[sighs]

43:02.329 --> 43:04.456
Got an update on FDA approvals?

43:04.540 --> 43:06.834
Isabel and I couldn't find
a single contentious decision.

43:06.917 --> 43:10.337
FlagKind's gonna have to give away
their new drug free of cost.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.632
-That's mighty specific.
-What else are they gonna do? Apologize?

43:13.716 --> 43:14.842
They could pay a fine.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.636
I've never heard of a Big Pharma company
giving away their drugs for free.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.471
Sweetheart, I'm inside Moss' head.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.806
-[cell phone chimes]
-This could be the breaking point

43:20.889 --> 43:23.183
for our Republican voters
that are leaning to the center.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.603
A new poll shows Porter is still ahead
in New York by four points.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.355
We cannot let this election
slip through our fingers.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.567
Go scrub through all the old footage
we have for new spots.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.653
We're gonna keep rolling 'em out. Go. Go.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.450
I think Lorraine has a mole
in the Moss campaign.

43:40.534 --> 43:41.535
No way.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.958
[inaudible]

43:49.960 --> 43:52.588
That was an operation
for the history books.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.633
-I got lucky.
-This is no time for modesty.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.552
You saved a lot of lives today,
Mr. President.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.639
That's not gonna stop me
from mourning the ones I didn't.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.099
Which is the reason why
you're the right man for this job.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.561
Could you imagine a corporate shill
like Porter at the helm today?

44:07.645 --> 44:09.271
Or a petty dictator like Moss?

44:09.355 --> 44:12.816
They don't care about service,
country, the American people.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.319
They care about power.

44:15.944 --> 44:18.822
-But I'm the one losing.
-You're gonna beat Porter.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.950
But Moss does ignite
a portion of this country

44:22.034 --> 44:26.330
that many of us like to forget exists,
which is why you have to beat him.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.415
Today proved that.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.210
Mr. President, Deputy Director Lewis.

44:31.293 --> 44:32.586
The heroes of the hour.

44:34.129 --> 44:37.716
Mr. President, I'm afraid Dr. Mays
has some disturbing news.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.219
I was taking down my posts about Momberg,

44:40.302 --> 44:43.847
and I came across instructions
to make his nightmare virus online.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.474
How is that possible?

44:45.557 --> 44:47.101
[Dianne] Before Momberg killed himself,

44:47.184 --> 44:50.646
he uploaded his methodology
to a public DIY forum.

44:50.729 --> 44:53.857
They've scrubbed it, but it's already been
downloaded at least a dozen times.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.568
So you're telling me that anyone
can access this information and use it?

44:56.652 --> 45:00.030
Not anyone. It's an insanely
difficult piece of genetic engineering,

45:00.114 --> 45:01.490
and there's no way to know for sure

45:01.573 --> 45:03.325
if it would have been lethal
without testing it.

45:03.409 --> 45:06.286
-Quantico's running a sample.
-What can we do about this?

45:06.370 --> 45:09.289
Start controlling the sale
of genetic material.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.042
Make lethal sequences hard,
if not impossible, to get.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.879
And, if Agent Wells taught me anything,

45:15.963 --> 45:18.841
get people like me, scientists,
to advise you.

45:18.924 --> 45:21.885
-And if this happens again?
-Not "if," sir, "when."

45:22.511 --> 45:25.389
This wasn't the first time.
It won't be the last.
