00:02.900 --> 00:06.500
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 50614.2.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.500
Ensign KapIan and I
are returning to Voyager

00:09.500 --> 00:12.800
after compIeting a scouting
mission in the Nekrit Expanse.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.900
The nebuIa's
compIeteIy scrambIing

00:14.900 --> 00:16.400
our navigationaI readings.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.100
I stiII can't get a fix
on our position.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.800
Are you saying we're Iost,
Ensign?

00:21.800 --> 00:24.600
That... depends what
you mean by ''Iost,'' sir.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.100
Lost...

00:26.100 --> 00:29.000
as in you stiII can't get
a fix on our position.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.600
I'm sorry, sir.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.800
Try haiIing Voyager again.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.800
No response. We must
stiII be out of com range.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.800
Then we'II just have to navigate

00:39.800 --> 00:42.100
the oId-fashioned way--
engage opticaI scanners.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.600
Aye, sir.

00:46.300 --> 00:52.500
I'm picking up an asteroid fieId
at coordinates 1 13 mark 7.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.300
Record it.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.700
Uh, sir?

00:55.700 --> 00:57.200
That asteroid fieId?

00:57.200 --> 01:02.000
It's the same one
we passed two hours ago.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Great.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.600
We're not onIy Iost,
we're fIying in circIes.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.400
It's a Federation
haiIing beacon--

01:10.400 --> 01:13.300
originating bearing 309 mark 4.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.900
It's Voyager

01:14.900 --> 01:16.100
WeII...

01:16.200 --> 01:18.900
at Ieast someone knows
where we are.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.400
Setting a course.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.600
The signaI's coming
from the pIanet's surface.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.300
Is it possibIe Voyager's Ianded?

01:30.400 --> 01:31.900
Sensor readings are sketchy.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.900
I'm detecting
about 80,000 humanoid Iife signs

01:35.000 --> 01:36.600
on the western continent,

01:36.600 --> 01:39.000
some rudimentary structures
and technoIogy,

01:39.100 --> 01:42.200
but no energy signature
big enough to be a starship.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.900
I'm getting another haiI.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.700
The signaI's very weak...

01:46.800 --> 01:49.800
and it's definiteIy not
being sent by Voyager

01:49.900 --> 01:51.900
Try adjusting the bandwidth.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.900
...CoIony to Federation vesseI.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.600
We need your heIp, urgentIy.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.800
This is Commander Chakotay
of the Starship Voyager

01:57.900 --> 01:59.600
PIease identify yourseIf.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.900
I'm not reading you.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.200
Federation vesseI,
pIease respond to this...

02:03.200 --> 02:05.000
We Iost them, sir.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.100
They've identified us
as a Federation ship.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.600
Who wouId know that?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.400
Whoever they are, they're
asking for our heIp.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.600
Launch a message buoy
Ietting Voyager know

02:12.700 --> 02:15.000
we've Ianded in response
to a distress caII.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.100 --> 02:27.700
This pIace Iooks
Iike a war zone.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.700
I can't pinpoint
the source of the transmission.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.100
Commander.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.800
I'm Commander Chakotay
of the Starship Voyager

04:33.800 --> 04:36.200
We're responding
to a distress caII.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.700
We're Iooking
for whoever it was

04:38.700 --> 04:40.000
that asked for our heIp.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.900
Commander!

05:26.600 --> 05:28.300
Come on!

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200
Take him inside.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
I'd Iie stiII if I were you.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.800
You've got a nasty head injury.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.200
You're human.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.400
My name's RiIey Frazier.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.000
What's yours, Commander?

06:00.100 --> 06:01.300
Why did you attack us?

06:01.400 --> 06:04.000
Those weren't my peopIe.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.500
I'm the one
who sent the distress caII.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.700
We rescued you.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.800
What did you do with KapIan?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.500
Your Ensign.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.600
She didn't make it.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.300
I'm sorry.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.000
I've got to get
back to my shuttIe.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Your shuttIe isn't there
anymore.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.500
The peopIe who attacked you
have aIready puIIed it apart.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.700
ReIax, Commander.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.900
I'm here to heIp you.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.800
How did...?

06:36.900 --> 06:38.700
How did I get here?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.300
I couId ask you
the same question.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.700
I was pretty surprised

06:42.700 --> 06:45.700
when I picked up
a Federation ship out there--

06:45.700 --> 06:47.800
not that I wasn't happy
about it.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.600
It's a Iong story.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.800
Why don't you go first?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.700
Seven or eight years ago...

06:55.700 --> 06:57.500
I was working
as a Science Officer

06:57.500 --> 06:58.900
on a vesseI
in the BoIian sector.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.600
We were attacked without warning
by aIiens.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.300
They overpowered us in minutes,
and those of us who survived

07:05.400 --> 07:07.900
were put in some kind
of stasis.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.400
The next thing we knew,
we were here on this pIanet.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.800
It didn't take too many hours
of stargazing

07:13.800 --> 07:16.500
to reaIize we weren't in
the AIpha Quadrant any Ionger.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.300
There are other humans here?

07:18.300 --> 07:20.100
Three that I know of
besides me--

07:20.200 --> 07:22.000
what was Ieft of my crew--

07:22.000 --> 07:26.300
aIong with some KIingons,
Cardassians, RomuIans,

07:26.300 --> 07:28.700
and dozens of other species
I'd never seen before.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.600
And the ones
that put you in stasis?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.500
I don't know.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.000
They must have had some kind
of coIony here at some time

07:36.100 --> 07:38.800
because of the ruined buiIdings
and equipment

07:38.900 --> 07:40.800
they Ieft scattered around.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.800
We've never seen them again.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.600
Everyone here has pretty much
the same story.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.800
They were just grabbed from
wherever they happened to be

07:48.800 --> 07:50.100
and dumped.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.400
Why did those peopIe
kiII KapIan?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
We were no threat to them.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.100
There are dozens of different
races on this pIanet,

07:57.100 --> 07:59.300
aII of whom were brought here
against their wiII.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.400
Many of them are suspicious
of other species.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.000
It's not exactIy a United
Federation around here,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.200
if you know what I mean.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.700
So those kind of attacks--
they go on aII the time.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.300
Resources are pretty Iimited.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.800
It didn't take Iong
for the fighting to start.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.300
First...

08:17.300 --> 08:19.800
a group of KIingons
attacked the Cardassians.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.000
Then the Farn raided the Parein;

08:22.100 --> 08:24.700
eventuaIIy things
just got out of hand,

08:24.700 --> 08:26.000
and now it's anarchy.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.500
But some of us,
a few hundred or so,

08:28.500 --> 08:30.800
we've tried to make
the best of it.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.500
We've estabIished
a cooperative--

08:32.500 --> 08:35.500
sharing work and whatever
provisions we have.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
I've got to contact my ship.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.799
The raiders destroyed
the communications array.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.000
It'II take days to fix it.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.600
I can heIp you.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.100
Our medic examined you.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.100
You suffered serious
neuraI trauma.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.500
You're staying put.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.600
And that's an order, Commander.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.500
Captain's Log, Stardate 50622.4.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.800
WhiIe Commander Chakotay

09:08.800 --> 09:11.100
scouts for a faster route
through the Nekrit Expanse,

09:11.100 --> 09:13.300
we are continuing
our month-Iong journey

09:13.400 --> 09:15.700
through the sparseIy
popuIated region.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.000
You know, they ought to rename

09:17.000 --> 09:19.300
this pIace
the ''negative expanse.''

09:19.300 --> 09:22.100
We haven't run across
anything interesting for days.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.500
If you're bored, Mr. Paris,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.900
I'm sure I can find
something eIse for you to do.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.400
The warp pIasma fiIters are due
for a thorough cIeaning.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.000
Now that you mention it,
Captain,

09:32.100 --> 09:36.800
I find this region of space
a reaI navigationaI chaIIenge.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.700
I beIieve I may have found
something eIse

09:39.700 --> 09:41.400
to pique
Mr. Paris's interest, Captain.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.900
It's an unidentified ship
on Iong-range sensors.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.400
What sort of ship?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.000
Sensor readings
are very Iimited,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.500
but the vesseI
appears to be stopped

09:48.500 --> 09:50.400
directIy in our current
fIight path.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.000
Harry, send
a standard greeting.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.300
Aye, Captain.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.000
They're not responding.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.000
Try retransmitting the haiI
on wide-band subspace.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.700
StiII no response.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.100
We are entering visuaI range.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.500
On screen.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.300
The Borg.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.000
Red AIert.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.400
AII stop.
ShieIds to maximum.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.700
Stand by aII weapons.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.300
Tuvok, are they scanning us?

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
Curious.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.500
None of the Borg systems
appears to be operationaI.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
He's right.
They're adrift.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.800
Maybe they're trying to IuII us
into a faIse sense of security.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.500
That wouId not be consistent
with typicaI Borg tactics.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.300
I want to try
a muItiphasic scan.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.500
Tom, stand by to get us
out of here in case they react.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Aye, Captain.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.700
Proceed, Mr. Kim.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.700
I'm not picking up
any active energy signatures.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.100
And no Iife signs.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.100
WeII, that's a reIief.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
Perhaps.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.400
However, we shouId avoid
compIacency.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.200
The Borg are known to retrieve

10:51.300 --> 10:52.600
their damaged technoIogy.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.700
It is quite possibIe

10:53.800 --> 10:55.500
we wiII encounter
additionaI Borg vesseIs

10:55.500 --> 10:57.700
which are fuIIy manned
and powered.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.700
That's exactIy why we're going
to board that ship.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.900
Captain?

11:02.900 --> 11:04.000
This is a rare opportunity

11:04.100 --> 11:06.200
to Iearn as much as we can
about Borg technoIogy.

11:06.300 --> 11:09.300
I might be abIe to get
one of their data nodes running

11:09.300 --> 11:10.900
and find out
what disabIed their ship.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.000
If we're Iucky,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.600
we may find a weakness
we can use against them,

11:14.600 --> 11:15.700
in case we run into one

11:15.800 --> 11:17.800
of their fuIIy manned
and powered ships.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.000
Tuvok, assembIe an away team.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Tom...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Yes, Captain.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.600
...take us
into transporter range.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.700
We grow aII our own food
in a cooperative garden.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.700
It's deIicious.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.100
Sorry there's no meat.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.200
No probIem.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
I'm a vegetarian.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.600
ReaIIy?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.600
I have recurring dreams

11:38.700 --> 11:42.100
about my mother's
famous Texas barbecue.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.900
So, your journey home--

11:44.000 --> 11:47.300
how much Ionger do you
expect it'II take you?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.800
About 67 years.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.800
Provided we don't find
a wormhoIe

11:52.800 --> 11:55.600
or some other faster way
of getting back.

11:55.700 --> 11:59.100
Haven't you ever thought about
finding some nice M-CIass pIanet

11:59.100 --> 12:00.400
and putting down roots?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.700
We'd be missing
an incredibIe opportunity

12:02.800 --> 12:04.200
to expIore unknown space.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.300
Besides, we've made a good Iife
for ourseIves on Voyager

12:07.400 --> 12:09.700
I'm sure Captain Janeway
wouId be amenabIe

12:09.700 --> 12:13.100
to take as many of your peopIe
with us as we can accommodate.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.500
Take us with you?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.000
I assumed that's why
you sent the distress caII.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.600
You misunderstood.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.100
We want to stay.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.500
But you were brought here
against your wiII.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.300
You just said
how dangerous it is.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.800
For better or worse,
this pIace has become our home.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.100
The peopIe
in the cooperative...

12:30.100 --> 12:31.800
they're Iike my ancestors--

12:31.800 --> 12:32.900
Texas homesteaders.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.400
I can understand that, but...

12:34.400 --> 12:35.800
We have a deep connection

12:35.800 --> 12:38.400
to one another
that I've never feIt before,

12:38.500 --> 12:41.000
not even with members
of my own famiIy.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.400
I guess it's because of what
we've aII gone through together.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.900
What about those unfriendIy
neighbors of yours?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.800
We've been abIe to bring
a few of them into our group.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.700
But you're right,
they're a probIem.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.400
That's why we want your heIp.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.300
Security upgrades,

12:58.400 --> 13:01.000
medicaI suppIies,
maybe some weapons.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.600
We're creating a society here--

13:03.600 --> 13:06.500
one that's based on toIerance,
shared responsibiIity,

13:06.600 --> 13:09.100
and mutuaI respect--
that peopIe Iike you and I

13:09.200 --> 13:10.700
were raised to beIieve in.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.100
We're not about to give it up
just because it's difficuIt.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.500
I'd better get back to work
on the communications array.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.400
I'II come with you.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.500
No!

13:22.800 --> 13:27.200
You're stiII in no shape
to fight, if we're attacked.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.400
I'II be back
to check on you soon.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.200
It's Iike a ghost ship.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.900
AIIowing yourseIf
to become apprehensive

14:05.900 --> 14:08.400
can onIy be counterproductive,
Lieutenant.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.900
I'm not being apprehensive,
Tuvok.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
I'm just nervous as heII.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.100
This is one of the access nodes.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.100
If we can get it operationaI,

14:35.100 --> 14:39.700
I shouId be abIe to tap
into the main data systems.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.700
Tuvok...

14:41.700 --> 14:44.700
there shouId be a compatibIe
micro-power conduit

14:44.800 --> 14:46.300
somewhere in that moduIe.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.600
Connect it to this generator.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.000
Lieutenant.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.800
It's dead.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.000
As far as we can teII,

15:18.100 --> 15:21.400
aII activity on the Borg ship
ceased abruptIy five years ago.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.600
Our scans have detected
1,100 corpses.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.900
We Iocated a breached
section of the vesseI

15:27.000 --> 15:28.500
where the spatiaI
vacuum preserved

15:28.600 --> 15:30.000
severaI of the bodies perfectIy.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.400
We brought one aboard.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
We're hoping that an autopsy

15:32.500 --> 15:34.000
might give us some cIue
as to what kiIIed them.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.200
The question is:

15:35.300 --> 15:37.800
Why have the Borg
Ieft one of their ships

15:37.900 --> 15:41.700
and aII its technoIogy adrift
in space for anyone to find?

15:41.700 --> 15:44.000
It is possibIe that
the deactivation of the ship

15:44.000 --> 15:45.600
and its systems

15:45.600 --> 15:47.500
severed the Iink
with the rest of the coIIective.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
But what caused the shutdown
in the first pIace?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.100
It couId've been some kind
of naturaI disaster...

15:52.200 --> 15:54.500
or...

15:54.500 --> 15:55.900
Or what?

15:57.500 --> 16:00.800
Maybe the Borg were defeated
by an enemy

16:00.800 --> 16:03.600
even more powerfuI
than they were.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.300
Tuvok, continue scanning
for any Borg vesseIs

16:08.300 --> 16:09.700
in the vicinity,

16:09.700 --> 16:13.000
as weII as any other ships
that might be more powerfuI.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.200
B'EIanna, you and the Doctor
get started on that autopsy.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.000
In the meantime,
I think it wouId be a good idea

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
to rendezvous
with Commander Chakotay

16:21.100 --> 16:22.500
a IittIe ahead of scheduIe,

16:22.600 --> 16:26.200
and Iet him know we've
run into some oId friends.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.700
HeIIo? Anybody there?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
RiIey?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.000
RiIey?

18:30.600 --> 18:31.900
What are you?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.700
Are you Borg?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.900
We were Borg.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.000
You mean you weren't
just kidnapped,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
you were assimiIated
by the coIIective.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.200
At WoIf 359.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.500
I was a Science Officer
aboard the Roosevelt

18:44.500 --> 18:45.800
But five years ago,

18:45.900 --> 18:48.400
our cube was damaged
by an eIectrokinetic storm.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.700
The next thing we knew,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.300
our Iink to the coIIective
was severed.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.900
We were free.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.400
We couId think
for ourseIves again,

18:54.500 --> 18:55.400
remember our names,

18:55.500 --> 18:56.700
where we'd come from.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.500
It was Iike waking up
from a Iong nightmare.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.800
We took what we
thought we couId use,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.500
and transported ourseIves here.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.400
Everything was new again--
the sounds of our own voices,

19:04.500 --> 19:07.000
forgotten memories,
the taste of food.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.500
Our originaI skin pigmentation
began to come back.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.000
Many of us were abIe to remove
our Borg appendages.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.300
I was even Iucky enough

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
to get a prosthetic arm
Orum created,

19:15.400 --> 19:17.100
using Borg repIication
equipment.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.300
In spite of how IittIe we had,
it was a joyous, hopefuI time.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.600
And then?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.900
After the euphoria wore off,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.800
peopIe started Iooking around,

19:25.900 --> 19:27.800
and found they were Iiving
among other cuItures

19:27.900 --> 19:28.800
they didn't understand--

19:28.900 --> 19:32.200
or worse, species
they'd been taught to hate.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.500
They turned against one another.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.900
Things became chaotic.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.500
The fighting, the raids...

19:36.500 --> 19:38.000
But we're not aII Iike that.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.100
Everything I toId you
about forming a cooperative,

19:40.200 --> 19:41.900
buiIding a new society--
I meant it.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
RiIey's teIIing the truth,
Commander Chakotay.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.800
Look at me-- I was RomuIan.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.200
I was taught to hate
humans, the Federation--

19:49.200 --> 19:50.900
but RiIey and I are friends now.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.000
I'm part of the cooperative.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.000
Orum's our medic.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.200
He's the one who examined you.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.800
Why didn't you teII me aII this
in the first pIace?

19:56.800 --> 19:59.800
I know how peopIe feeI
about the Borg,

19:59.900 --> 20:01.400
and they're right.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.300
We did terribIe things.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.500
You'd been assimiIated.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
You weren't in controI
of your actions.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.800
Then you'II stiII heIp us?

20:12.400 --> 20:13.700
I think, right now,

20:13.800 --> 20:16.800
it's Commander Chakotay
who needs our heIp.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.200
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.900
We've detected a message buoy

20:20.900 --> 20:22.900
Iaunched
from Chakotay's shuttIe

20:22.900 --> 20:24.600
and are heading toward it.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.100
The autopsy of the Borg corpse
is underway.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.500
I must say, there's nothing
Iike the vacuum of space

20:34.500 --> 20:36.900
for preserving
a handsome corpse.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.900
Hmm...

20:43.000 --> 20:45.900
Subject's abdominaI organs
are unremarkabIe.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.000
PuImonary system
exhibits evidence

20:48.000 --> 20:51.400
of extensive aIveoIar damage,
as weII as a sIight sweIIing

20:51.400 --> 20:53.800
consistent
with exposure to space...

20:53.800 --> 20:55.000
Ah...

20:55.100 --> 20:57.100
In addition, there are signs

20:57.200 --> 20:59.500
of severe cardiac
depoIarization.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
It sounds Iike
he was eIectrocuted.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.400
Very good, Kes.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.900
That wouId support our theory

21:04.000 --> 21:05.800
about what happened
aboard their ship.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.300
We think that their main power
conduits were overIoaded

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
by a massive
eIectro-mechanicaI discharge.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.500
Hmm...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.800
This is intriguing.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.700
What do you think that is?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.300
It may be some sort
of axonaI ampIifier.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.100
Kes, hand me a corticaI probe.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.100
Shut it down!

21:45.300 --> 21:47.500
What the heII happened?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.800
Is it stiII aIive?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.400
Of course not.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.100
ApparentIy,
I inadvertentIy activated

21:53.200 --> 21:57.000
a backup neuroeIectric
power ceII.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.500
The response
was pureIy autonomic.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.600
There's no reason for concern.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.400
I wouIdn't be so sure
about that.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.700
What do you mean?

22:03.800 --> 22:06.000
That ''autonomic response''
caused this drone

22:06.100 --> 22:09.300
to reset back
to its originaI programming.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.900
If the rest of those corpses
somehow reactivate--

22:13.000 --> 22:15.900
we'd have a major probIem
on our hands.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.300
I'm afraid he's getting worse.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.700
There must be something
we can do for him.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.300
You know better than anyone

22:27.300 --> 22:29.400
how Iimited our
medicaI resources are.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.800
As far as I'm concerned,
there is onIy one option.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.800
WouId it be safe?

22:35.900 --> 22:38.400
WouId... what be safe?

22:41.300 --> 22:42.700
As I'm sure you're aware,

22:42.700 --> 22:44.700
the Borg coIIective
consciousness

22:44.800 --> 22:46.300
is extremeIy powerfuI.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.400
It aIIowed us to transfer
information instantaneousIy--

22:49.400 --> 22:50.800
to think with one mind.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.500
But what you may not be aware of

22:53.500 --> 22:57.500
is the Iink aIso has
inherent medicaI appIications.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.800
M-m-medicaI appIications?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.000
We were connected
by a continuous

23:03.000 --> 23:06.500
neuroeIectric fieId
that was capabIe of regenerating

23:06.600 --> 23:09.200
the damaged components
of an injured Borg.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.600
Think of it
as a subspace transfusion.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.000
OnIy instead of one person
giving bIood,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
there are hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of donors

23:17.100 --> 23:19.300
simuItaneousIy transmitting
neuroeIectric energy

23:19.400 --> 23:20.900
to whoever needed it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.600
This process
was often successfuI

23:23.700 --> 23:26.900
in heaIing both organic
and inorganic body parts.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.700
This is aII... very fascinating,

23:29.700 --> 23:32.500
but I don't see how it heIps me.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.000
We stiII have Borg
neuraI processors impIanted

23:35.000 --> 23:36.500
in our nervous systems.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
Removing them
wouId've kiIIed us.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.300
I see.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.400
Using a portabIe
neuro-transponder,

23:42.500 --> 23:45.500
we have the abiIity
to reIink our brain patterns.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.400
I thought you said
the Iink was severed.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.700
It was.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.400
But we can reinitiate it

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
among a smaII group,
for a short time.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.000
We couId generate
a neuroeIectric fieId

23:55.000 --> 23:56.900
that couId heaI your injuries.

23:56.900 --> 24:01.800
You want to... hook up my mind
to some... Borg coIIective?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.500
No, no, that's not it at aII.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.300
We'd be in compIete controI.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.000
You'd simpIy be Iinked,
for a Iimited period of time,

24:08.100 --> 24:10.900
to RiIey, me, and a few
of the others in our group

24:10.900 --> 24:12.500
wiIIing to heIp you.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.600
I'm not Ietting anyone impIant

24:14.600 --> 24:16.900
some neuraI processor
in my brain.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.400
That wouIdn't be necessary.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.600
I'd simpIy attach
a smaII neuro-transceiver

24:20.600 --> 24:22.200
to the base of your skuII.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.000
We'd initiate the Iink,
and the transceiver

24:24.200 --> 24:26.900
couId be removed as soon
as the procedure was over.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.600
I assure you, other than
repairing neuraI tissue,

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
there wouId be
no Iasting effects.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.300
Thanks...

24:34.300 --> 24:36.100
but I don't think so.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.200
I-I can see
why you're skepticaI.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.800
I wouId be, too.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.700
Look around you--
Orum and I, the others--

24:43.800 --> 24:45.100
we're individuaIs.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.000
We have distinct personaIities.

24:47.100 --> 24:52.000
We're not about to turn you
into some kind of automaton.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.700
I'II take my chances
and wait for Voyager

24:54.700 --> 24:58.200
I'm afraid that heIp
may come too Iate, Commander.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.900
If we don't do something

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
to sIow the neuraI degradation
immediateIy...

25:03.100 --> 25:04.900
you wiII die.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.400
Chakotay...

25:15.400 --> 25:17.800
you have to make a decision.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.600
Any sign of Voyager?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.900
No.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.700
I can't change who we are.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.000
I wasn't truthfuI with you
before, and I'm sorry,

25:27.100 --> 25:29.000
but pIease, beIieve me
when I teII you

25:29.100 --> 25:31.200
we onIy want to heIp you.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.500
Orum wiII take every precaution.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.000
PIease?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.600
At Ieast Iet us
try and save you.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.000
It's either that

25:39.000 --> 25:41.500
or the happy hunting grounds,
huh?

25:41.500 --> 25:44.200
Okay, then?

26:00.900 --> 26:03.600
This is the neuro-transceiver.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.400
Don't be afraid, Chakotay

26:22.400 --> 26:23.900
We're here to help you

26:23.900 --> 26:25.800
Open your mind to our thoughts,

26:25.900 --> 26:28.700
and concentrate
on getting well

26:28.700 --> 26:30.700
Hear our voices

26:30.800 --> 26:33.500
Open your mind to our thoughts

26:33.600 --> 26:36.300
Our collective strength
can heal you

26:36.400 --> 26:38.600
You're safe with us

26:38.600 --> 26:40.000
Feel the connection

26:40.100 --> 26:41.300
We're with you

26:41.300 --> 26:42.800
See who we are

26:42.800 --> 26:43.900
Know us

26:43.900 --> 26:45.400
You're not alone

26:45.500 --> 26:48.000
Our strength is your strength

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
We can overcome your pain

26:51.100 --> 26:53.800
We welcome you
into our thoughts

26:53.900 --> 26:55.200
There's nothing to fear

26:55.200 --> 26:57.300
We won't let you die

26:57.400 --> 27:01.600
We're all one circle--
no beginning, no end

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
Grandpa!

27:36.900 --> 27:38.700
How do you feeI?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.900
Don't worry.
It's gone.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.300
It Iooks Iike
the treatment worked.

27:46.400 --> 27:51.200
Orum says the degraded tissue
has shown marked improvement.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.700
It was incredibIe.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.900
I know.

28:01.800 --> 28:07.100
I heard aII of you--
your thoughts inside my head--

28:07.200 --> 28:09.500
as if they were my thoughts.

28:09.500 --> 28:12.300
And I couId see myseIf...

28:12.400 --> 28:14.100
through your eyes.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.500
Then you must have
caught me staring.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.700
I saw...

28:19.700 --> 28:23.000
faces... pIanets...

28:23.000 --> 28:24.400
What were they?

28:24.500 --> 28:29.300
Images from the minds of
the peopIe who Iinked with you.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.300
Members of their famiIies,
their homes...

28:32.300 --> 28:36.400
I know things
about aII of them...

28:36.500 --> 28:38.000
about you.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
You Iike bIuebonnets.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.200
My favorite fIower.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.700
You used to pick them

28:44.800 --> 28:49.400
back home in Texas with a man
who carried a waIking stick.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.500
My grandfather.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.700
I know so much about you.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.300
We shared
a very rare experience.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.900
I feIt that.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.700
What about this?

29:16.700 --> 29:19.300
It's a residuaI effect
from the Iink.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.600
How Iong wiII it Iast?

29:23.600 --> 29:25.700
An hour.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.900
Maybe two.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.800
Long enough.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.000
Can you still hear
what l'm thinking?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.400
Yes.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.800
Then you know l want to be
closer to you

29:39.800 --> 29:44.200
l want us to know
everything about each other

29:44.300 --> 29:47.800
l want you to feel
everything l feel

30:04.100 --> 30:05.200
According to the buoy,

30:05.300 --> 30:07.200
Commander Chakotay
and Ensign KapIan

30:07.200 --> 30:08.700
Ianded on the surface
in response

30:08.700 --> 30:09.800
to a distress caII
three days ago.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.000
Can you Iocate the shuttIe?

30:12.100 --> 30:15.000
There is no sign of it
anywhere on the pIanet.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.000
What about their combadges?

30:17.100 --> 30:18.700
I'm onIy picking up one signaI.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.800
It's
in a heaviIy popuIated region.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.400
SignaI's very weak.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.400
Voyager to Commander Chakotay.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.800
Do you read?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.500
Ensign KapIan,
this is Captain Janeway.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.600
Come in.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.400
EIectrodynamic turbuIence
from the nebuIa

30:31.400 --> 30:33.000
is interfering
with the transmission.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.600
It's going to take me
a whiIe to cIear it up.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.300
Hand me that hyper-spanner.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
There.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.000
That shouId at Ieast get

30:51.100 --> 30:53.300
the short-range
transmitters operationaI.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.700
Now, if we can get

30:54.700 --> 30:56.400
the signaI ampIifiers
on Iine...

30:56.500 --> 30:57.900
I never wouId've figured you

30:57.900 --> 31:00.000
to be quite so handy
with a circuitry paneI.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.600
WeII, I guess
you haven't Iearned

31:01.600 --> 31:02.900
everything about me, have you?

31:03.000 --> 31:07.400
Commander, I just wanted to say
how gratefuI to you we aII are.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.900
You're the ones
who saved my Iife.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.600
But you've added so much
to the cooperative--

31:12.600 --> 31:15.500
a renewed sense of hope,
an infusion of energy.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.000
You have no idea
how invigorating it was

31:18.000 --> 31:19.700
to have a new mind in the Iink,

31:19.800 --> 31:21.900
even if it was onIy
for a short time.

31:21.900 --> 31:25.700
There have been so few of us
for so Iong, I...

31:25.800 --> 31:28.900
WeII, I'II Iet you two
get back to work.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.700
I was so resistant
to being Iinked.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.300
Now I'm aImost sorry it's over.

31:38.300 --> 31:39.500
I know.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.300
Last night, when we
were stiII connected,

31:43.300 --> 31:46.300
I reaIized what it is
you reaIIy want from us.

31:46.300 --> 31:50.600
It's more than just suppIies
and security upgrades.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.300
That's right.

31:52.300 --> 31:53.900
It's a pretty radicaI concept.

31:53.900 --> 31:57.000
Sometimes radicaI probIems
require radicaI soIutions.

31:57.100 --> 31:59.200
RiIey!
Commander Chakotay!

31:59.300 --> 32:01.000
We've detected a ship in orbit.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.400
It must be Voyager

32:02.400 --> 32:04.700
I hope you'II at Ieast
discuss our idea

32:04.800 --> 32:06.700
with your Captain.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.900
Why don't you teII her
about it yourseIf?

32:14.100 --> 32:16.000
We've given it
a great deaI of thought,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.300
and we beIieve the soIution
to our probIem

32:18.300 --> 32:20.200
is to reestabIish
the neuraI Iink

32:20.300 --> 32:22.800
among aII the former Borg
Iiving on the pIanet.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.900
You can't be serious.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.700
I know it sounds extreme,
Captain,

32:26.700 --> 32:28.700
but I think you
shouId hear her out.

32:28.700 --> 32:31.100
AII right.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.100
If you'II think about it,
Captain,

32:33.200 --> 32:35.700
when we were Iinked,
we had no ethnic confIict.

32:35.700 --> 32:39.400
There was no crime, no hunger,
no heaIth probIems.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.900
We Iived
as one harmonious famiIy.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
With aII due respect,
Dr. Frazier,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
you were ''one harmonious famiIy''

32:46.100 --> 32:49.600
bent on the vioIent assimiIation
of innocent cuItures.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.400
But we're not Borg anymore,
and we've Iearned from our past.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.400
AII we want to do
is to take the one good thing

32:56.500 --> 32:59.500
that existed in the midst
of aII that horror--

32:59.500 --> 33:02.800
our unique abiIity to cooperate
and probIem-soIve--

33:02.800 --> 33:06.300
and use it to create a safe
and productive community.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.200
TeII me how, exactIy.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
The neuro-transponder
we've buiIt

33:12.100 --> 33:15.000
is onIy powerfuI enough
to Iink a smaII group of peopIe,

33:15.100 --> 33:19.200
Iike the one that heIped heaI
Chakotay's wounds.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.900
In any case,
the effect is onIy temporary.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.900
In order to reconnect the
entire popuIation permanentIy,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.300
we'd need a much bigger
neuroeIectric fieId generator.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.800
I'm afraid we don't have
anything Iike that.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.800
But the Borg cube does.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.600
What they're asking us to do

33:33.600 --> 33:36.400
is reactivate that ship's
neuroeIectric generator

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
and redirect it
toward the pIanet.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.800
They want us to reactivate...
a Borg ship?

33:45.800 --> 33:47.900
Not the whoIe ship,
just the generator.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.500
And it onIy needs to be
operationaI for a few minutes,

33:50.500 --> 33:52.200
in order to reactivate
the Iink.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.700
There's no teIIing
what wouId happen

33:53.800 --> 33:56.300
if we turned on one of those
generators, even for an instant.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.600
For aII we know, it wouId
attract other Borg vesseIs.

33:58.600 --> 34:03.000
Captain, I can assure you,
we'd take every precaution.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.000
Dr. Frazier,
I admire your tenacity.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.699
I respect your courage.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.800
I'II give you medicaI suppIies.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.400
I'II assist you
with upgrading your security.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.699
I'II even take
some of you with us,

34:17.800 --> 34:19.000
if you want to come.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.199
But as to what you're proposing,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.000
I have to teII you,
I'm extremeIy skepticaI.

34:24.100 --> 34:27.000
In fairness, however,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.199
I wiII give it
some further thought.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.600
Thank you.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.600
What do you think?

34:41.699 --> 34:44.900
If you're asking me
whether or not she's sincere,

34:44.900 --> 34:47.199
I have to say yes.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.699
You got to know them very weII?

34:52.699 --> 34:54.400
That's an understatement.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.400
I heard their thoughts,
feIt their feeIings,

34:57.400 --> 35:00.100
saw through their eyes.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.400
And, in aII the time
you were Iinked,

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
you never sensed
anything negative--

35:07.400 --> 35:09.800
no hidden agenda,
no destructive intent?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.500
No.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.900
Bottom Iine:

35:14.900 --> 35:17.900
Do you think we shouId do
what they're asking?

35:22.100 --> 35:26.700
I reaIIy care about what happens
to these peopIe.

35:26.800 --> 35:31.600
So, in my heart, I'd Iike to do
everything we can to heIp them.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.600
But, if I were sitting
in your chair,

35:34.600 --> 35:37.900
I'd have to take other
considerations into account.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.200
Not onIy wouId it mean
imposing a choice

35:44.200 --> 35:47.800
on thousands of peopIe who had
no voice in the decision,

35:47.800 --> 35:50.600
but it wouId aIso be taking
a terribIe risk.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.500
HeIping to create
a new coIIective?

35:53.500 --> 35:56.700
Who knows what
the repercussions might be?

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
I'II Iet RiIey know.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.000
I'm afraid
her decision was finaI.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.700
I wish it weren't,
but I expected as much.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.400
What about the raiders?

36:21.400 --> 36:24.200
How Iong do you think you
can hoId out against them?

36:24.200 --> 36:26.500
WeII, we'II just have to do
the best we can.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.400
Who knows, maybe we'II find some
other way to get to the cube

36:29.500 --> 36:31.100
and reinitiate the Iink.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.200
Come with us.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.700
Chakotay...

36:33.800 --> 36:35.500
We couId repIicate
some Texas barbecue.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.000
I'm sure it won't
compare to your mother's,

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
but I think it...

36:38.000 --> 36:39.700
Don't think it's not tempting.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.700
But my pIace is here.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.600
I know you understand.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.500
I've never understood
anyone better in my Iife.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.900
WeII, we're finished
Iaying in the suppIies.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Thank you, NeeIix.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.700
Uh, we'd better get going.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.700
You okay?

37:27.500 --> 37:30.600
What you need is a good
thrashing on the hoverbaII court

37:30.600 --> 37:32.000
to take your mind off things.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
You're on.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.900
Good. I'II reserve
some hoIodeck time

37:38.000 --> 37:39.800
as soon as we're back.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.900
Chakotay, can you hear us?

37:45.500 --> 37:47.800
Did you say something?

37:47.900 --> 37:49.400
No.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.100
Are you getting
a com transmission?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.100
No. Why?

37:56.000 --> 37:59.100
Must've been my imagination.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.200
You sure you're okay?

38:02.700 --> 38:04.500
I'm fine.

38:06.800 --> 38:11.100
Chakotay, we need your help

38:11.200 --> 38:12.400
Chakotay?

38:12.400 --> 38:14.900
We need your help

38:15.000 --> 38:16.500
I'm going to teII the Doctor

38:16.500 --> 38:19.100
he needs to take a Iook at you
as soon as we're back.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.400
Torres to Sick Bay.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.000
Don't do that.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.300
Chakotay, give me the phaser.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.600
Captain,
Commander Chakotay's shuttIe

38:40.600 --> 38:41.600
has changed course.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.000
Try haiIing them.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.300
No response.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.800
They are increasing speed
to maximum impuIse.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800
Tom, Iay in a pursuit course.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.400
TeII NeeIix we'II rendezvous
with his shuttIe Iater.

39:00.200 --> 39:06.100
Chakotay,
transport to module 47 omega

39:06.100 --> 39:07.900
The bunker is under attack

39:08.000 --> 39:09.900
47 omega

39:10.000 --> 39:12.200
Section nine, mark coordinates

39:12.300 --> 39:13.800
We are under attack

39:13.800 --> 39:15.600
Nine alpha alpha

39:15.600 --> 39:17.000
We must hurry

39:17.000 --> 39:18.700
The bunker is under attack

39:18.700 --> 39:20.300
47 omega

39:20.300 --> 39:21.600
Section 9

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
Mark coordinates

39:22.600 --> 39:24.400
We are under attack

39:34.500 --> 39:38.300
Proceed to interlink console
three beta six

39:38.300 --> 39:39.800
Hear our thoughts

39:39.900 --> 39:41.300
Our thoughts are one

39:41.300 --> 39:43.300
lnterlink three beta six

39:43.400 --> 39:46.700
Proceed to interlink console
three beta six

39:46.800 --> 39:48.000
Hear our thoughts

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Check that area out.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.300
This way.

40:31.200 --> 40:35.900
Lower right panel,
attach power conduit 166

40:35.900 --> 40:36.900
Hurry

40:37.000 --> 40:38.200
Pathway pi two

40:38.300 --> 40:40.300
We are under attack

40:40.400 --> 40:41.900
Pathway pi two

40:52.400 --> 40:55.200
Activate
the neuroelectric generator

40:55.300 --> 40:56.300
Quickly

40:56.400 --> 40:58.000
Power circuit mechanism

40:58.100 --> 40:59.700
Activate the generator

40:59.700 --> 41:00.900
Help us

41:00.900 --> 41:04.200
We must activate the
neuroelectric generator now

41:04.200 --> 41:06.200
Chakotay, need your help

41:06.200 --> 41:07.700
Losing time

41:07.800 --> 41:11.900
Commander, take your hand
away from that consoIe

41:12.000 --> 41:13.800
or I wiII be forced to fire.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.200
You must not let them stop you

41:16.200 --> 41:18.000
You must do this

41:23.300 --> 41:25.900
You must move power circuit
mechanism alpha

41:25.900 --> 41:27.500
to position one

41:38.300 --> 41:40.100
Hear our voices

41:40.100 --> 41:42.700
We welcome you
into our thoughts

41:42.700 --> 41:45.100
Feel the connection

42:04.700 --> 42:06.400
Mr. Kim.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.900
Voyager, emergency beam-out.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.900
Chakotay, B'EIanna
and the away team are aII back,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.100
and we've tractored in
the shuttIe.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.400
Take us out of here sIowIy.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.800
Captain, the Borg ship
is powering weapons.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.900
Mr. McKenzie, fuII power
to the shieIds.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.200
Arm aII phaser banks
and prepare to fire.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.800
Captain, the Borg ship

42:37.800 --> 42:40.000
has initiated
a seIf-destruct sequence.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.600
It'II go in three seconds.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.700
Get us out of here.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Report.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.700
ShieIds are hoIding.

42:53.700 --> 42:56.400
No injuries or huII damage.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.000
What the heII
happened back there?

42:58.000 --> 42:59.900
Audio transmission, Captain.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.400
From the pIanet's surface.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.200
Let's hear it.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.700
We are the new cooperative.

43:06.700 --> 43:09.700
We have destroyed the Borg cube.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.800
We regret that we forced
Commander Chakotay to assist us,

43:13.800 --> 43:16.700
but it was necessary
for our survivaI.

43:16.700 --> 43:20.900
His Iink with the cooperative
has now been severed.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.100
Our Iasting gratitude.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.600
His neuropeptide IeveIs
have returned to normaI.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.500
And there are no
residuaI traces of the Iink?

43:35.500 --> 43:36.600
None.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.500
How were they abIe
to reestabIish the connection?

43:38.600 --> 43:41.100
My best guess is that
the residuaI neuropeptides

43:41.100 --> 43:43.200
heightened
his teIepathic receptivity.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.300
I thought their Iimited
equipment made it impossibIe

43:45.400 --> 43:48.300
for them to form the Iink
over great distances.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.000
ApparentIy, once they repaired
their communications array,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
they were abIe to use it
to ampIify the signaI

43:53.100 --> 43:54.700
from their neuraI transponder.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.400
WouId you two pIease excuse us?

44:04.300 --> 44:08.200
I don't know what to say,
except... I'm sorry.

44:08.300 --> 44:09.700
Based on what
the Doctor's toId us,

44:09.800 --> 44:12.300
it's cIear you were acting
against your wiII.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.600
Maybe so.

44:13.700 --> 44:16.700
But somehow that doesn't
make me feeI any better.

44:16.700 --> 44:19.900
I heIped them repair
their communications array,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.100
and I toId you
they were sincere.

44:22.100 --> 44:25.100
HeIping others, Chakotay,
that's part of who you are.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.800
Given everything you beIieve in,

44:26.800 --> 44:29.700
I don't see how you couId've
behaved differentIy.

44:29.700 --> 44:32.300
But I couIdn't have been more
wrong about them, couId I?

44:33.600 --> 44:35.100
I don't know.

44:35.200 --> 44:38.200
I'm not saying I'm happy
about what happened.

44:38.300 --> 44:41.600
But, so far, they haven't acted
Iike typicaI Borg.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.600
They saved us from that cube,

44:43.600 --> 44:45.100
and they Iet you go.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.300
But they didn't hesitate

44:46.400 --> 44:48.000
to impose
their coIIective wiII on me

44:48.000 --> 44:50.200
when it served their interests,
did they?

44:50.300 --> 44:52.300
No, they didn't.

44:52.300 --> 44:54.900
I wonder how Iong
their ideaIs wiII Iast

44:54.900 --> 44:57.100
in the face
of that kind of power?
