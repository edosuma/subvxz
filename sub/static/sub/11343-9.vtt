00:01.617 --> 00:03.335
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.377 --> 00:06.971
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous,

00:07.017 --> 00:11.010
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:11.057 --> 00:14.572
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.617 --> 00:16.608
'These are their stories,'

00:18.177 --> 00:22.136
Sex Crimes? Take a look at this.

00:22.177 --> 00:25.214
Girl hanged herself from the bed.
Name's Layla Briggs.

00:25.257 --> 00:28.488
Neighbours said she was a good tenant.

00:28.537 --> 00:31.893
- Looks like she killed herself.
- Anything she didn't pierce?

00:31.937 --> 00:35.213
- She must set off metal detectors.
- And burn marks.

00:35.257 --> 00:39.330
We got reasons to believe
this is anything other than a suicide?

00:39.377 --> 00:41.891
Yeah. The robe was tied
over her folded arms.

00:41.937 --> 00:46.249
That's not impossible.
I'm no Houdini, but how hard is that?

00:46.297 --> 00:48.686
The robe was open. Did you open it?

00:48.737 --> 00:52.047
I was told it was a suicide.
I examined the body.

00:52.097 --> 00:55.407
- Did your men disturb the body?
- My first instinct was suicide.

00:55.457 --> 00:58.210
The second I thought different.
I called you guys.

01:48.297 --> 01:52.495
I don't get S&M, 'Hurt me,
that turns me on,' What's up with that?

01:52.537 --> 01:54.493
It starts with the tattoos.

01:54.537 --> 01:57.734
It's a matter of time
before you beg to be spanked.

01:57.777 --> 02:00.496
Tattoos are a gateway to sexual dark side.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.971
You've finally figured me out.

02:03.017 --> 02:05.815
Did you get off on the pin pricks of pain?

02:05.857 --> 02:08.417
- I get that working with you.
- Please.

02:08.457 --> 02:12.609
Benson, your prelim on Briggs,
you omitted a cause of incident.

02:12.657 --> 02:15.046
The first COD was death by hanging,

02:15.097 --> 02:18.487
but there were irregularities.
We want to talk to the ME.

02:18.537 --> 02:21.654
- Homicide or suicide?
- We need more information.

02:21.697 --> 02:24.655
The baby ME at the scene
disrobed the body.

02:24.697 --> 02:27.006
Where do they get these people?

02:27.057 --> 02:31.096
The vic had self-inflicted wounds
or willingly endured wounds.

02:31.137 --> 02:35.096
Which raises the possibility
this is neither suicide nor homicide.

02:35.137 --> 02:39.335
Rough sex gone awry? You get that
explanation from defence attorneys.

02:39.377 --> 02:43.575
This girl was into paraphilia.
She was pierced from head to toe.

02:43.617 --> 02:46.893
- And she works on Wall Street?
- Investment analyst.

02:46.937 --> 02:49.371
Those two worlds overlap.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.806
What worlds? S&M and high finance?

02:51.857 --> 02:55.850
Yeah. The all-consuming obsession
to destroy political competitors

02:55.897 --> 02:59.526
is no different than the compulsion
to harm one's fellow man.

02:59.577 --> 03:01.568
Or woman.

03:02.577 --> 03:06.252
Talk to the family.
Munch, Cassidy, find out where she worked.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.891
What does Special Victims Unit mean?

03:12.937 --> 03:15.735
We investigate sexually based offences.

03:15.777 --> 03:18.211
What happened to Layla?

03:18.257 --> 03:20.817
We're hoping that you can help us.

03:22.177 --> 03:24.566
I have no idea.

03:24.617 --> 03:28.053
Mrs Briggs, you probably knew her
better than anyone.

03:28.097 --> 03:31.885
- If you tell us about that aspect...
- What aspect?

03:31.937 --> 03:36.806
The piercings, scars on her body.
They threw up a red flag for us.

03:36.857 --> 03:40.133
She kept me at arm's length
about those things.

03:40.177 --> 03:42.452
Her father died when she was 15

03:42.497 --> 03:45.375
and after that, she and I drifted apart.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.885
When was the last time you two spoke?

03:47.937 --> 03:51.088
A week ago.
She was chipper and upbeat.

03:51.137 --> 03:55.096
- Any signs of depression?
- No. Certainly not suicidal.

03:55.137 --> 03:57.446
She was happy with her job.

03:57.497 --> 04:01.775
Was there anything that you noticed?
Any changes in her behaviour?

04:01.817 --> 04:04.934
We didn't talk about anything personal.

04:04.977 --> 04:07.889
- Maybe that was wrong.
- You do what you can.

04:07.937 --> 04:11.327
You can't stop a child
from doing what she's gonna do.

04:11.377 --> 04:14.813
When she was in 10th grade,
she was in the shower once.

04:14.857 --> 04:17.370
I was bringing her fresh towels

04:17.416 --> 04:19.976
and I saw it.

04:20.017 --> 04:22.212
Saw what?

04:22.257 --> 04:24.725
Metal rings through her nipples.

04:24.777 --> 04:27.496
- That's when it began.
- What did you say?

04:27.537 --> 04:31.496
I thought if I pitched a fit,
it would only encourage her,

04:31.537 --> 04:34.005
give her something to rebel against.

04:34.057 --> 04:36.730
Maybe make it worse.

04:39.417 --> 04:42.409
I guess nothing worse can happen now.

04:46.057 --> 04:49.652
Layla was the analyst
for our derivative financial instruments.

04:49.697 --> 04:53.212
Let's pretend this is economics.
We're not majors, OK?

04:53.257 --> 04:55.976
Insurance companies collect premiums.

04:56.017 --> 04:59.805
Some money pays claims,
other money is held in a cash reserve.

04:59.857 --> 05:02.212
Layla invests the rest.

05:02.257 --> 05:04.976
- How much is that?
- Billions.

05:05.017 --> 05:08.805
- Did that create enemies for Layla?
- No, why would it?

05:08.857 --> 05:12.054
We're talking about
the concentration of power.

05:12.097 --> 05:15.726
My insurer's renters' cheque
joins another and another

05:15.777 --> 05:19.406
until that trickle becomes a flood.
That wealth is a threat

05:19.457 --> 05:23.245
to the people that want you to stay in line.
That can create enemies.

05:23.297 --> 05:26.972
First, that's not how it works
and second, Layla was well liked.

05:27.017 --> 05:30.134
We're more
interested in Layla's state of mind.

05:30.177 --> 05:32.975
- Was there a crisis in her life?
- Not that I saw.

05:33.017 --> 05:34.973
What do you do here?

05:35.017 --> 05:38.327
Manage the office.
My boyfriend, Mr Martin, owns the company.

05:38.377 --> 05:40.572
Did he have contact with Layla?

05:40.617 --> 05:42.733
- Very little.
- Who did?

05:42.777 --> 05:46.850
Our head of finance, Sho-Ling Fu.
But she's not in today.

05:46.897 --> 05:50.526
- We'll need her number.
- We frown on incoming calls.

05:50.577 --> 05:52.807
They distract from the task at hand.

05:52.857 --> 05:55.690
We frown on obstruction of justice.

05:56.977 --> 06:00.413
COD is asphyxiation
from a ligature around the neck.

06:00.457 --> 06:04.086
- Just as it appeared.
- Straightforward cause of death.

06:04.137 --> 06:08.415
A cause isn't always an explanation.
Homicide, suicide or accident?

06:08.457 --> 06:12.132
I'm not gonna declare
until I have more information from you.

06:12.177 --> 06:16.136
- Was she sexually assaulted?
- Assault is hard to determine.

06:16.177 --> 06:19.806
She was penetrated
but we've recovered no bodily fluids.

06:19.857 --> 06:23.372
Also, the scarring and sexual injury
she endured for years

06:23.417 --> 06:26.056
would send someone
to prison except for one thing.

06:26.097 --> 06:28.452
- It was self-inflicted.
- Perhaps.

06:28.497 --> 06:31.295
Maybe the terminal injury was self-inflicted.

06:31.337 --> 06:33.771
An auto-erotic fatality?

06:33.817 --> 06:37.332
Well, I could see that, but look at this.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.931
- It's the robe she was wearing.
- Yeah.

06:40.977 --> 06:43.969
Perfectly clean. No sweat, no soiling.

06:44.017 --> 06:46.531
Someone redressed her?

06:46.577 --> 06:48.727
Remorseful killer?

06:48.777 --> 06:51.769
Sometimes family members
clean up the scene.

06:51.817 --> 06:55.332
Layla may have been
experimenting sexually.

06:55.377 --> 06:58.733
We'll spare you the details,
but if that's the case,

06:58.777 --> 07:02.133
it means that it wasn't a suicide.
It was an accident.

07:02.177 --> 07:04.293
Layla was a good girl.

07:04.337 --> 07:07.135
This doesn't mean she wasn't a good girl.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.613
But if you know something more,
you gotta help us out.

07:10.657 --> 07:14.252
Help us find out
what really did happen to Layla.

07:15.257 --> 07:17.407
I was bringing her a cake.

07:17.457 --> 07:20.574
I didn't wanna be nosy.
She didn't like that.

07:20.617 --> 07:23.085
I was just gonna let myself out.

07:24.817 --> 07:26.887
And then...

07:26.937 --> 07:29.405
And then you walked into her room.

07:31.657 --> 07:35.206
You think it can't be true when you see it.

07:35.257 --> 07:38.215
I felt dizzy, I laid down on the floor.

07:38.257 --> 07:41.249
I didn't know what to do.

07:41.297 --> 07:44.369
I wanted to call someone, l-l...

07:44.417 --> 07:46.612
I thought I should call my minister,

07:46.657 --> 07:50.616
but I didn't want him to see her like that.
Then everyone would know.

07:50.657 --> 07:54.366
You were embarrassed for her.
We understand that.

07:54.417 --> 07:58.569
She was wearing this weird leather thing
and other things.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.847
I don't even know what they are.

08:00.897 --> 08:06.654
I got rid of all that, I put a robe
over her shoulders and called the police.

08:06.697 --> 08:10.246
Where did you put the things
you found in her bedroom?

08:10.297 --> 08:14.085
In a blue plastic bag.
I threw all that filth in a dumpster.

08:14.977 --> 08:18.936
The best I can tell, this is
the outfit she wore when she died.

08:18.977 --> 08:22.447
Bodily fluids in all the right places
- hers and a man's.

08:22.497 --> 08:25.489
- I sent semen traces out for DNA.
- She had a partner.

08:25.537 --> 08:29.974
She's got a whipping boy for some
rough sex and he gets carried away?

08:30.017 --> 08:33.373
Or it's a homicide meant to look like that.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.885
So, the whipper boiled over.

08:35.937 --> 08:40.054
Except no one got whipped.
I tested this for epidermal traces.

08:40.097 --> 08:44.727
It came back negative.
It's in as-new condition and it rattles.

08:44.777 --> 08:49.692
That's odd. Let's open it up,
see what's making that sound.

09:23.457 --> 09:28.292
They're pinning this on
auto-erotic asphyxiation. Terminal sex.

09:28.337 --> 09:31.568
Yeah, except auto-erotic
implies one person.

09:31.617 --> 09:33.687
- And?
- She wasn't alone.

09:33.737 --> 09:38.686
We recovered the outfit she was wearing.
Seminal fluid was found on it.

09:38.737 --> 09:42.525
And we found a whip
filled with $500,000 worth of diamonds.

09:42.577 --> 09:45.728
You'll be able to find out
where they came from.

09:45.777 --> 09:48.575
Show her photo around the diamond district.

09:48.617 --> 09:52.656
We have her credit card records.
She frequented sex and fetish shops.

09:52.697 --> 09:56.576
See if you can get the names
of any of her sex partners.

10:00.457 --> 10:04.245
I know her but we try to protect
the privacy of our customers

10:04.297 --> 10:07.175
The world can be judgmental
of human behaviour.

10:07.217 --> 10:09.333
We leave that to the prosecutors.

10:09.377 --> 10:12.175
- What was your sense of Layla?
- My sense?

10:12.217 --> 10:15.334
First timer, she's a little shy.

10:15.377 --> 10:17.891
A yuppie with a wild streak. Why?

10:17.937 --> 10:20.895
We found her dead,
trussed up like a latex turkey.

10:20.937 --> 10:26.091
My God! We talked about code words,
safe-play techniques and so on.

10:26.137 --> 10:28.810
That lesson didn't stick so well, did it?

10:28.857 --> 10:31.052
Did you know any of her partners?

10:32.057 --> 10:35.174
She came in one time
with her boss's girlfriend.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.254
- A big redhead?
- No, brunette. Why?

10:38.297 --> 10:40.765
We met a different girlfriend,

10:47.617 --> 10:50.529
Pretty girl, but I've never seen her.

10:50.577 --> 10:54.172
She purchased about
$500,000 worth of diamonds.

10:54.217 --> 10:57.846
The only people dealing
with those quantities are crooks

10:57.897 --> 11:00.092
or professional diamond dealers.

11:00.137 --> 11:03.174
I'd never sell that much
to someone I didn't know.

11:03.217 --> 11:06.493
- Reputation is everything.
- Would that hurt your reputation?

11:06.537 --> 11:09.574
Diamonds are the traveller's cheques
of the underworld.

11:09.617 --> 11:12.370
They're valuable, impossible to trace.

11:12.417 --> 11:15.966
Once you sell to one creep,
all the rest come to your door.

11:16.017 --> 11:18.736
Do you know anyone
who's less scrupulous?

11:18.777 --> 11:21.610
There's one man, he will sell to anyone.

11:21.657 --> 11:25.366
Large, small quantities,
he doesn't care, David McKuin.

11:25.417 --> 11:29.490
He's in the same building. Suite 505.

11:29.537 --> 11:32.973
Layla Briggs. Sure, big buyer.
Came in two weeks ago.

11:33.017 --> 11:36.487
- She's dead.
- What happened?

11:36.537 --> 11:40.052
We're trying to find out.
Did she buy diamonds from you?

11:40.097 --> 11:42.133
- A big order.
- How big?

11:42.177 --> 11:47.888
$9,416,000. She wanted 10 million.
I couldn't come up with it,

11:47.937 --> 11:51.247
$9,500,000 worth of diamonds. Wow.
What were they for?

11:51.297 --> 11:55.893
She said it was for her work.
High finance, I don't understand it.

11:55.937 --> 11:59.407
You don't ask questions
when you can make a quick buck.

11:59.457 --> 12:04.133
- I resent that.
- Resent a stolen property enquiry?

12:04.177 --> 12:06.213
I didn't steal anything.

12:06.257 --> 12:09.294
That doesn't mean
they can't scare away dealers.

12:09.337 --> 12:13.330
So tell us whether she bought
any diamonds for personal use.

12:13.377 --> 12:17.689
No. It was for her business.
She even paid with a corporate cheque.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.127
- Can I get a copy of that cheque?
- Sure.

12:21.177 --> 12:25.011
If I were ripping off my company,
I'd want this jeweller as my guy.

12:25.057 --> 12:27.525
Think that's what she was doing?

12:27.577 --> 12:32.014
- Maybe. And someone wanted a cut.
- Still have to cash them out.

12:32.057 --> 12:34.855
There.
Cheque's from Martin Global Fund.

12:34.897 --> 12:37.457
Signed by her supervisor,
Sho-Ling Fu.

12:37.497 --> 12:41.206
OK. Someone might wanna try
and fence these same diamonds.

12:41.257 --> 12:44.772
If they come in wanting to move
a large amount, call us.

12:44.817 --> 12:47.536
- Yes, I'll call.
- Thanks.

12:52.177 --> 12:54.896
Yeah, I got it, I understand.

12:54.937 --> 12:57.167
A redhead and a brunette.

12:57.217 --> 12:59.936
Thanks for the razor-sharp description.

12:59.977 --> 13:03.447
Munch says this Martin guy
has two stunning girlfriends.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.647
Keeping his options open, I guess.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.291
We have many accounts
in many currencies.

13:08.337 --> 13:11.647
It's nearly $10m and you don't remember it?

13:11.697 --> 13:15.610
I sign a transaction that big several
times a week. What was it for?

13:15.657 --> 13:17.932
Layla used it to purchase diamonds.

13:17.977 --> 13:19.968
She did some commodities hedging.

13:20.017 --> 13:23.327
Once in a while,
you take a delivery of actual goods.

13:23.377 --> 13:27.006
Warren Buffet has four London vaults
filled with silver.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.810
- So, where are they?
- How would I know?

13:29.857 --> 13:33.088
Cos you're in charge of finances.

13:33.137 --> 13:37.608
And we're investigating a murder.
Mr Martin's office is where?

13:39.377 --> 13:42.289
Down the hall. It's marked.

13:42.337 --> 13:44.567
Thank you.

13:48.097 --> 13:51.806
- We're looking for Frank Martin.
- Who are you?

13:51.857 --> 13:54.417
We're detectives, Benson and Stabler.

13:54.457 --> 13:58.086
Sorry, I was just fixing
one of the computers. It crashed.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.935
But better the machine than the market.

14:00.977 --> 14:05.175
Computers will always break down,
but the most important equipment

14:05.217 --> 14:08.289
- is the nut behind the keyboard.
- Mr Martin,

14:08.337 --> 14:11.966
I started this company in my garage
on this same computer.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.611
Now it's a multi-billion dollar empire.

14:14.657 --> 14:19.333
US capital markets are the greatest
wealth-creation engines ever.

14:19.377 --> 14:22.449
The power of the bull market
is a force of nature

14:22.497 --> 14:24.772
and I have surfed it successfully.

14:24.817 --> 14:28.207
I keep that computer
to remind me of where I started.

14:28.257 --> 14:30.566
How long did Layla Briggs work here?

14:30.617 --> 14:32.926
Two years. Shame what happened.

14:32.977 --> 14:35.013
Were you aware of her personal life?

14:35.057 --> 14:38.493
- You mean the sex stuff?
- Yes, the sex stuff.

14:38.537 --> 14:42.769
Her predilections were well-known
but she kept it out of the office.

14:42.817 --> 14:45.206
You ever have a problem with theft?

14:45.257 --> 14:49.853
- I've had to fight off hackers.
- No, I meant Layla.

14:49.897 --> 14:54.254
She purchased thousands of dollars
of sex gear on your credit cards.

14:54.297 --> 14:59.371
Oh, that. What's the difference
between paying for a golf membership

14:59.417 --> 15:01.692
and paying for her habits?

15:01.737 --> 15:04.615
Jack Nicklaus never died from playing golf.

15:04.657 --> 15:08.889
You're right and I wanna help you guys
find out what happened to her.

15:08.937 --> 15:11.974
Layla purchased
nearly $10m worth of diamonds

15:12.017 --> 15:15.487
- two weeks before her death.
- That was a financial move.

15:15.537 --> 15:18.734
We were betting on diamond futures
going up.

15:18.777 --> 15:21.530
- Was that common knowledge?
- Diamond futures?

15:21.577 --> 15:25.286
- That she took care of the goods.
- It's in the financial report.

15:25.337 --> 15:28.249
Anyone could tell that she had the jewels.

15:28.297 --> 15:30.413
What's the distribution list?

15:30.457 --> 15:33.893
Everybody here
and the board of directors of the charity

15:33.937 --> 15:37.725
- get a weekly report.
- Charity on Wall Street.

15:37.777 --> 15:41.736
We're not all vultures. We invest a large
fund for the New Vision Endowment.

15:41.777 --> 15:45.326
They give eye glasses to poor children.

15:46.897 --> 15:49.457
When was the last time you saw Layla?

15:49.497 --> 15:52.614
Last week.
She brought by the quarterly reports.

15:52.657 --> 15:55.808
- They were stellar.
- What did she do for you?

15:55.857 --> 15:59.327
- She managed our endowment.
- And what did that entail?

15:59.377 --> 16:03.734
Non-profit charities like ours,
we don't spend all the money at once.

16:03.777 --> 16:06.610
An endowment keeps us going
from year to year.

16:06.657 --> 16:08.613
Like an investment pool.

16:08.657 --> 16:12.445
Yes. The better the returns,
the more money we can put to work.

16:12.497 --> 16:16.854
- Layla made our money work hard.
- Did she ever mention diamonds?

16:16.897 --> 16:20.253
No, but she made
some exotic financial returns.

16:20.297 --> 16:23.494
- They paid off.
- Exotic puts your endowment at risk.

16:23.537 --> 16:25.926
I didn't know what Layla was doing.

16:25.977 --> 16:29.890
Hedge funds, futures, I didn't care
as long as it brought in the funds.

16:29.937 --> 16:33.612
- You risked the endowment.
- Her company got power of attorney.

16:33.657 --> 16:35.534
- Who?
- Frank Martin.

16:35.577 --> 16:39.855
He guaranteed that if anything went south,
he would bail us out.

16:39.897 --> 16:43.810
It was a financial move based on
the flow of the commodities market,

16:43.857 --> 16:47.645
$500,000 worth of diamonds
was found with Layla's body.

16:47.697 --> 16:53.613
Layla had some strange habits but she
was honest. She had no need to steal.

16:53.657 --> 16:57.332
Could she have afforded those jewels
on her own?

16:57.377 --> 17:00.687
Sure. Many times over.
She made millions here.

17:00.737 --> 17:04.127
Sometimes it's not about money.
Was she angry at you?

17:04.176 --> 17:07.692
- No, we had a good relationship.
- Was it ever sexual?

17:07.737 --> 17:11.570
No. There's a fine line between
tolerating sexual behaviour

17:11.617 --> 17:14.336
and encouraging it,

17:14.377 --> 17:17.210
The Hang Seng opened up 49 points.

17:17.257 --> 17:19.691
Yes! Er, if you'll excuse me.

17:19.737 --> 17:22.854
The Hang Seng can hang.
Who was Layla dating?

17:22.896 --> 17:25.694
- I don't know.
- You must have some idea.

17:25.737 --> 17:28.615
If you ask those questions
in the workplace,

17:28.657 --> 17:32.650
you set yourself up for a big fat
lawsuit nowadays, so I don't ask,

17:34.777 --> 17:39.851
- Where are you on the Briggs case?
- Looks like high finance and low urges.

17:39.897 --> 17:42.809
She bought the kinky stuff
with corporate credit cards

17:42.857 --> 17:46.247
and everyone she works with
seems to know about it.

17:46.297 --> 17:49.972
She was a financial whizz.
She managed a charity fund.

17:50.017 --> 17:53.487
Charity begins at home.
90 cents of every dollar in the can,

17:53.537 --> 17:57.576
- ends up in someone's pocket.
- Well, that's cynical.

17:57.617 --> 18:01.769
That's life. The records of
a non-profit are public information.

18:01.817 --> 18:04.854
Let's find out what they were really doing.

18:04.897 --> 18:07.172
What's that?

18:07.217 --> 18:10.095
The financial records for your foundation.

18:10.137 --> 18:14.255
It seems out of the $18 million
you took in, less than one million

18:14.297 --> 18:18.415
- went for charitable works.
- No, no, you're reading it wrong.

18:18.457 --> 18:23.531
Here, look. Fourteen million for glasses.

18:23.577 --> 18:25.932
Anyone can print up a report.

18:25.977 --> 18:30.971
We talked to the bank. There is no account.
They've never heard of you.

18:31.017 --> 18:35.727
- What are you saying?
- You and Layla had a scam going.

18:35.777 --> 18:40.214
She embezzles money, you sign off
on the reports, but she gets greedy.

18:40.257 --> 18:42.930
Are you suggesting that I killed Layla?

18:45.737 --> 18:49.889
That's not what happened.
I knew about the financial irregularities

18:49.937 --> 18:52.212
but I never benefited.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.488
- Oh, come on, please.
- It's true.

18:55.537 --> 18:58.176
At least not financially.

19:00.217 --> 19:02.811
Layla would make certain donations.

19:02.857 --> 19:06.247
I would then invest the proceeds
with her company.

19:06.297 --> 19:09.653
Martin laundered money.
Layla was his bag man.

19:09.697 --> 19:13.133
I presume. All I had to do
was look the other way.

19:13.177 --> 19:17.614
Why did you allow her to use your charity?
What was in it for you?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.854
We shared certain compulsions.

19:22.657 --> 19:26.252
I tried but I was never able
to relieve myself of them.

19:27.657 --> 19:31.889
Layla knew me as the human ashtray.
We met on the circuit.

19:33.617 --> 19:37.496
The non-profit world
is very concerned with appearances.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.926
And she threatened to expose you.

19:39.977 --> 19:44.129
Unless I helped her. I did once.
That was the thin edge of the wedge.

19:44.177 --> 19:47.328
- What's the circuit?
- Various people.

19:47.377 --> 19:51.609
- The regular gig is Anna Faust.
- Did she know Layla?

19:51.657 --> 19:55.206
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
she knew Layla very well.

19:55.257 --> 19:57.851
I haven't seen Layla for four months.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.650
- But she was part of the circuit?
- The circuit?

20:00.697 --> 20:05.248
- The underground bondage scene,
- She came to my parties.

20:05.297 --> 20:08.255
- Until she was banished.
- What did she do?

20:08.297 --> 20:11.607
It wasn't what she did.
She was a submissive.

20:11.657 --> 20:13.852
Her master violated my rules,

20:13.897 --> 20:17.253
so both were informed
they were no longer welcome.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.288
And this master was...?

20:19.337 --> 20:22.090
A Wall Street financier
with a mean streak.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.855
His name is Frank Martin.

20:23.897 --> 20:26.092
We know him. How did he cross you?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.014
He hurt one of my girls.

20:28.057 --> 20:30.855
- What's her name?
- If I tell you,

20:30.897 --> 20:34.367
do you promise to give him
the punishment he deserves?

20:34.417 --> 20:36.772
Sure, that's what we hope to do.

20:36.817 --> 20:38.853
Good boy.

20:46.657 --> 20:48.295
Are you with Immigration?

20:48.337 --> 20:50.214
No, no.

20:50.257 --> 20:54.728
I don't care about that. I just want
you to tell me about Frank Martin.

20:58.457 --> 21:03.656
I met him at a party
where I was a... a paid submissive.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.655
He asked if I enjoyed air games.

21:08.057 --> 21:11.254
You mean, er, high-risk sex?

21:13.057 --> 21:17.448
That's what he wanted.
I told him, 'No, I don't do that,'

21:17.497 --> 21:20.057
But two days later, I get a call.

21:20.097 --> 21:22.611
He says he knows I'm here illegally.

21:23.457 --> 21:27.052
He says if I like living in New York.

21:27.097 --> 21:29.452
I should meet him for some games.

21:29.497 --> 21:34.332
And if I don't,
I'll get a free trip back to Vietnam.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.687
Meaning he would turn you over
to Immigration.

21:37.737 --> 21:43.255
I said I would do anything, anything,
if he would not send me back.

21:45.057 --> 21:47.048
What did he do?

21:48.457 --> 21:50.334
He wants to try choking me.

21:51.057 --> 21:53.252
I didn't understand at first.

21:53.297 --> 21:55.253
I was scared.

21:56.457 --> 22:00.086
But he promised it would be OK,

22:00.137 --> 22:05.052
so he took me
and put a belt around my neck.

22:06.017 --> 22:07.814
I blacked out.

22:07.857 --> 22:10.815
When I woke up, he was gone.

22:12.057 --> 22:13.854
I see,

22:30.257 --> 22:34.045
A shredding party,
a page out of the Oliver North playbook.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.656
Feds don't give a damn
about the dead girl.

22:38.697 --> 22:40.653
The financial fraud got 'em going.

22:40.697 --> 22:44.053
The powers-that-be protect themselves.
The FBI are hired guns.

22:44.097 --> 22:47.055
Fronting for the trilateral council
and the Mansons.

22:47.097 --> 22:50.055
Masons. It's still homicide.
Martin is our top guy.

22:50.097 --> 22:53.248
- So how do we go about finding him?
- Follow the money.

22:53.297 --> 22:56.448
- What little is left.
- Little. Nine million is little.

22:56.497 --> 22:59.853
Nine million in diamonds
is an albatross if you can't cash 'em.

22:59.897 --> 23:03.446
- Canvass the diamond dealers.
- I pulled some strings.

23:03.497 --> 23:06.853
A woman whose case I worked
is at the state insurance company.

23:06.897 --> 23:09.650
When I told her what this jerk did,
she unloaded.

23:09.697 --> 23:12.052
We're not alone in investigating him.

23:12.097 --> 23:15.851
The Tennessee Department of Commerce
was all over him like a cheap suit.

23:15.897 --> 23:19.253
- Did you get a number?
- Better. I got an address.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.811
They were so sceptical of this guy Martin

23:21.857 --> 23:25.452
- they sent an auditor 4 months ago.
- Yeah.

23:28.057 --> 23:31.208
Martin Global Fund
had a controlling interest

23:31.257 --> 23:34.408
in the Tennessee Valley
Teachers' Retirement Fund.

23:34.457 --> 23:37.051
Third quarter financial
showed irregularities

23:37.097 --> 23:38.849
so I went to perform an audit.

23:38.897 --> 23:41.855
- What d'you find?
- It's what they didn't find

23:41.897 --> 23:45.856
that made 'em send me to New York.
Irregular investments in oil fields,

23:45.897 --> 23:48.855
which might or might not have been
outside the charter.

23:48.897 --> 23:53.049
- Which is it?
- Aggressive but not illegal.

23:53.097 --> 23:56.646
I checked into the assets.
They were right on the line.

23:56.697 --> 23:59.495
You see, if they default...

23:59.537 --> 24:02.529
- Then Tennessee is on the hook.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:02.577 --> 24:05.535
The obligation is such
that I'm after some legal reason

24:05.577 --> 24:09.172
- to have the state take it over.
- Frank Martin is missing.

24:09.217 --> 24:13.654
We thought you may have
found something to help us find him.

24:13.697 --> 24:16.655
Man's a weasel.
I've been in this city five months.

24:16.697 --> 24:20.451
I know he's dirty.
I still can't find the smoking gun,

24:20.497 --> 24:23.409
Benson.

24:23.457 --> 24:27.848
Any associates you met through
your audits who might be sheltering him?

24:27.897 --> 24:30.650
Everything he does is barely legitimate.

24:30.697 --> 24:33.450
I gave you one address.
I'd have to give you 50.

24:33.497 --> 24:35.567
I tell you what. Why not give us 50?

24:35.617 --> 24:39.849
You got it. I've been trying
to nail Martin down for five months.

24:39.897 --> 24:43.856
When you catch him,
you give me a few minutes with him.

24:45.057 --> 24:46.854
- Ready for this?
- Go.

24:46.897 --> 24:49.491
That was Munch.
McKuin got a call from a woman

24:49.537 --> 24:52.256
wanting to sell a large quantity of diamonds.

24:52.297 --> 24:55.846
One thing Martin has going for him
is women that do his bidding,

25:01.457 --> 25:04.051
- Where's McKuin?
- Who are you?

25:05.577 --> 25:09.411
Sho-Ling Fu. Now answer my question.
Where's McKuin?

25:09.457 --> 25:11.049
I sent him on an errand.

25:11.097 --> 25:14.009
- McKuin runs errands?
- He does what I tell him.

25:14.057 --> 25:16.287
Most people in the industry do.

25:16.337 --> 25:20.046
- What industry?
- You never heard of John DeMunch?

25:21.457 --> 25:24.051
- You're John DeMunch?
- Let me put it this way.

25:24.097 --> 25:27.055
I could call Johannesburg,
release so many diamonds

25:27.097 --> 25:30.567
that whatever you're carrying
wouldn't be worth a pack of gum.

25:32.257 --> 25:35.454
- How do I know I can trust you?
- I'm a businessman.

25:35.497 --> 25:40.048
I don't think anyone has ever trusted me.
Your move.

25:40.097 --> 25:43.328
Hell of a job you've got.
What is it exactly that you do?

25:43.377 --> 25:45.049
I manage Martin Global.

25:45.097 --> 25:48.009
A multi-billion dollar
investment powerhouse.

25:48.057 --> 25:50.446
And before that you did what exactly?

25:50.497 --> 25:52.453
None of your business.

25:52.497 --> 25:55.648
You work there a year,
now you're a wizard of Wall Street.

25:55.697 --> 25:58.450
- I'm a fast study.
- We're not financial guys.

25:58.497 --> 26:02.046
We don't care about your scams.
I can't balance my cheque book.

26:02.097 --> 26:06.090
- Just tell us where Frank Martin is.
- I told you I don't know.

26:06.137 --> 26:09.447
There were diamonds with Layla's body.
This looks bad.

26:09.497 --> 26:11.294
They were a gift from a friend.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.055
Care to mention a name?

26:13.097 --> 26:15.691
James Bond. There's a name.

26:15.737 --> 26:19.889
- You're treading on thin ice here.
- We're gonna visit your friends.

26:19.937 --> 26:24.215
When we find the one who was
so generous, we'll pass on a thank you.

26:24.257 --> 26:26.725
- 'Lunch, David,'
- Give that back!

26:26.777 --> 26:30.247
'Dinner, David, David, David, David,
David Kelp,'

26:30.297 --> 26:32.652
That charity, the New Vision Endowment,

26:32.697 --> 26:35.370
nominal purchasers
of $9m worth of diamonds?

26:35.417 --> 26:37.885
He's not a good friend of yours, is he?

26:38.657 --> 26:43.731
- Last chance to talk.
- OK. Your coffee sucks.

26:43.777 --> 26:45.847
Bye, Sho-Ling.

26:48.897 --> 26:50.853
Sho-Ling didn't have much to say

26:50.897 --> 26:53.457
but her daybook did some talking for her.

26:54.857 --> 26:58.645
David Kelp, the charity guy.

26:58.697 --> 27:01.655
The diamond-hedge charity guy's
her boyfriend.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.294
You gonna pick him up?

27:04.337 --> 27:06.771
Can I beg off?
I gotta meet my phrenologist.

27:06.817 --> 27:10.856
- Your phrenologist?
- Yeah. Like feng shui for the head.

27:10.897 --> 27:14.526
- Takes seven months to get in.
- Wouldn't want you to miss that.

27:14.577 --> 27:17.250
- Me neither.
- Thanks, guys.

27:18.057 --> 27:20.446
Martin's employers are pawns
in this con.

27:20.497 --> 27:23.773
Kelp gives
the shady diamond purchase legitimacy

27:23.817 --> 27:26.012
by helping the poor and downtrodden.

27:26.057 --> 27:28.651
Who did Layla cross?

27:28.697 --> 27:30.653
Everybody?

27:44.057 --> 27:46.855
- Kelp!
- Kelp, we've got some questions.

27:54.057 --> 27:57.208
Keep me here any longer,
I'll strap a lawsuit on the city

27:57.257 --> 28:00.647
- to bring you down with it.
- Oh, we're stalling.

28:00.697 --> 28:05.851
We're frustrated cos we wanted David Kelp
to be a witness at your trial.

28:05.897 --> 28:09.128
The bullet through his forehead
put a damper on that.

28:11.257 --> 28:14.249
- What?
- He's dead,

28:19.657 --> 28:22.251
He did it.

28:22.297 --> 28:25.289
Frank Martin?

28:25.337 --> 28:27.851
Frank Martin never followed through

28:27.897 --> 28:30.650
on one thing in his entire life
until now.

28:30.697 --> 28:33.450
You're saying Frank Martin
killed David Kelp?

28:33.497 --> 28:36.170
He told me if I ran

28:36.217 --> 28:39.607
or if I went to the cops,
he would kill my boyfriend.

28:39.657 --> 28:42.296
What else did Frank Martin tell you?

28:44.457 --> 28:49.451
Frank came to me four hours ago
carrying a bag.

28:49.497 --> 28:54.173
Only this clear plastic bag
was full of diamonds.

28:54.217 --> 28:56.173
He told me to cash them out.

28:56.217 --> 29:00.574
Martin trusts you enough
to have you cash out his diamonds?

29:00.617 --> 29:02.687
No, Frank doesn't trust anyone.

29:04.857 --> 29:07.371
He knew David and I were close.

29:07.417 --> 29:10.887
- So he threatened David.
- Yeah.

29:10.937 --> 29:13.849
He asked for a favour
and in the same breath

29:13.897 --> 29:16.047
he threatened someone's life.

29:17.457 --> 29:20.847
- Classic Martin.
- Sounds like you know him well.

29:20.897 --> 29:25.049
When I first met Frank,
I was dancing in a cage

29:25.097 --> 29:28.055
with fluorescent green paint
all over me.

29:30.657 --> 29:33.217
He liked me,

29:33.257 --> 29:36.249
even though my name
was Angela Torres then.

29:36.297 --> 29:39.050
It was his idea to change it to Sho-Ling.

29:40.497 --> 29:42.647
That's what he gave me -

29:42.697 --> 29:45.291
an exotic ideal.

29:48.457 --> 29:52.052
Tell us where you were planning
to meet up with Frank.

29:55.537 --> 29:57.653
- Police!
- Freeze!

30:00.817 --> 30:02.773
Tucker?

30:02.817 --> 30:04.808
Evenin'.

30:11.857 --> 30:13.848
- Where's Frank Martin?
- Don't know.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.649
- Who was in your bed?
- I was.

30:15.697 --> 30:18.052
- Who was sleeping in the other bed?
- I was.

30:18.097 --> 30:20.657
- What does that mean?
- I always get two beds.

30:20.697 --> 30:23.006
Better chance of a decent mattress.

30:23.057 --> 30:26.447
Layla's death is at your feet
unless we get Frank.

30:29.257 --> 30:32.294
It's not a pretty life. It's dark all the time.

30:32.337 --> 30:34.453
And the mattresses suck.

30:35.257 --> 30:38.647
- He left an hour before you knocked.
- Where'd he go?

30:38.697 --> 30:40.847
- I don't know.
- What happened to Layla?

30:40.897 --> 30:43.855
- I don't know.
- You do know!

30:43.897 --> 30:45.853
Not... specifics.

30:46.657 --> 30:50.047
He called me after.
When I got there, he had her strung up.

30:50.097 --> 30:54.056
- What did Martin say when he called?
- Told me to go to Layla's apartment.

30:54.097 --> 30:56.247
- Did he give you directions?
- No.

30:57.057 --> 30:59.048
So you'd been there before.

31:00.457 --> 31:03.893
Layla was one of the best.
That's what I was expecting.

31:04.657 --> 31:08.730
Wait. You expected to have sex
with Layla with Frank there?

31:08.777 --> 31:12.133
Frank... helped her do things.

31:12.177 --> 31:14.247
Do things right.

31:15.057 --> 31:17.651
That's how he got me the first time.

31:17.697 --> 31:20.211
- When?
- Same time as the audit.

31:21.257 --> 31:23.054
Coincidence, right?

31:23.697 --> 31:27.451
Look, he gave me a taste of life
I never had before.

31:27.497 --> 31:30.648
What, a chance to hang out
with the popular kids?

31:33.257 --> 31:34.849
No.

31:37.857 --> 31:39.654
Wasn't that.

31:41.657 --> 31:45.616
It was the look on the face of
the first woman he introduced me to.

31:45.657 --> 31:47.648
She wanted me.

31:48.857 --> 31:50.734
That's a powerful feeling.

31:54.257 --> 31:56.248
And that was enough.

31:58.057 --> 32:00.048
That and the money.

32:01.857 --> 32:03.654
Look, I...

32:04.657 --> 32:07.091
I'm not very good around women.

32:07.137 --> 32:10.971
See, I'm awkward. My pits sweat.

32:11.017 --> 32:14.407
I chew my lower lip.
The women Frank introduced me to

32:14.457 --> 32:18.848
were not beautiful...
Well, y'know, they were beautiful...

32:18.897 --> 32:20.853
What about the money?

32:21.657 --> 32:23.852
Cash. Cars. Free time.

32:23.897 --> 32:25.853
I'd go back home

32:25.897 --> 32:28.457
and life was D-U-L-L.

32:30.097 --> 32:31.928
Layla was anything but.

32:31.977 --> 32:34.445
And when you entered her apartment?

32:34.497 --> 32:39.366
When I saw she was dead,
I hightailed it out of there.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.454
You didn't try to help Martin cover it up?

32:42.497 --> 32:45.250
- No.
- Why didn't you leave town?

32:46.057 --> 32:48.048
There was some money.

32:48.097 --> 32:49.928
Hush money.

32:49.977 --> 32:51.968
The diamonds.

32:54.017 --> 32:55.211
Yeah.

32:55.257 --> 32:58.294
Guess what? We have them.

33:02.057 --> 33:04.048
Where did Martin go?

33:09.657 --> 33:13.252
He didn't have a penny on him.
He hated being without money.

33:13.297 --> 33:15.970
Reminded him of when he was growing up.

33:16.017 --> 33:19.612
He's broke, he's a fugitive,
who would he turn to?

33:21.657 --> 33:23.568
Someone he could trust, Amy.

33:23.617 --> 33:27.576
Amy... whatshername. He still trusted her.

33:27.617 --> 33:29.369
Amy, the office manager?

33:31.057 --> 33:32.649
That's she.

33:36.857 --> 33:39.246
- Amy, who did this to you?
- Frank.

33:39.297 --> 33:42.846
- What happened?
- Frank came in all sweet,

33:42.897 --> 33:44.615
asked to borrow money.

33:44.657 --> 33:47.854
I said, 'I don't have any,
just the cards you gave me,'

33:47.897 --> 33:51.287
He exploded, said I owed him.
I was terrified.

33:51.337 --> 33:53.851
He hit me and he tore the place up.

33:55.337 --> 33:59.489
Then he finds some old unused
airline ticket, he got real crazy.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.052
- Crazy how?
- He holds me down

34:03.097 --> 34:06.533
and calls the airline desk in some hotel.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.408
Gets me to say I'm an invalid,

34:08.456 --> 34:11.415
that I'm sending my friend
to change the ticket.

34:11.456 --> 34:13.254
- They say OK.
- When was that?

34:13.297 --> 34:15.253
Not long ago.

34:15.297 --> 34:17.128
Frankie went too far.

34:17.857 --> 34:20.451
He finally went too far.

34:21.657 --> 34:25.445
Still having trouble with your card.
You might try a cheaper class.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.250
- Business class is very nice.
- Whatever.

34:28.297 --> 34:31.652
- Get me on the next plane.
- Need a lift?

34:31.697 --> 34:34.688
- Would you?
- Sure.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.614
What time are you due
at your brother's office?

34:37.657 --> 34:39.648
Whenever. Once we wrap this up.

34:39.697 --> 34:41.688
What line of work's your brother in?

34:41.737 --> 34:43.853
Stocks, bonds, this and that.

34:43.897 --> 34:46.206
I'd be happy to give him a few pointers.

34:46.257 --> 34:50.933
Great. We just need to verify
that you can use these credit cards.

34:50.976 --> 34:54.094
Which we assume you are
since it is Martin Global.

34:54.137 --> 34:56.856
Well, was. That was just an S-Corp.

34:56.897 --> 35:00.048
But the ex is still running up charges on it.

35:00.097 --> 35:03.851
These days, who knows who's getting
into your personal finances?

35:03.897 --> 35:05.774
Do you want a sparkling water?

35:05.817 --> 35:07.773
Bubbles give me gas.

35:07.817 --> 35:09.409
Maybe a cappuccino?

35:09.457 --> 35:12.415
- You got a machine?
- No, but we could order out.

35:12.457 --> 35:16.769
We're not beat cops, Mr Martin.
We're more like, erm, what?

35:16.817 --> 35:18.853
Erm, investigative bean counters.

35:21.217 --> 35:23.208
It's like that thing with Layla,

35:23.257 --> 35:25.213
that's out of our wheel house.

35:25.257 --> 35:28.374
We came in cos
there was a financial twist there.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.373
Because of the diamonds. Y'know.

35:30.417 --> 35:34.126
By the way, your friend Tucker
has some crazy story about you.

35:35.737 --> 35:37.489
Me? What?

35:37.537 --> 35:40.210
Nothing. Southerners, great storytellers.

35:40.257 --> 35:42.566
Yeah. Freddie's a born liar.

35:42.617 --> 35:44.608
Can I make a phone call?

35:44.657 --> 35:49.128
- I'll get you an outside line.
- No, that's OK. Look, can I go now?

35:49.177 --> 35:53.170
We're just waiting for the computer
to pull up your platinum card.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.048
- What time did you call?
- Who?

35:55.097 --> 35:58.567
Your friend, Freddie the liar.
You called him to Layla's.

35:58.617 --> 36:00.653
- When?
- That night.

36:00.697 --> 36:02.972
What night?

36:03.017 --> 36:05.611
Who? When? What?
We should hire this guy,

36:07.697 --> 36:10.086
I need to call my lawyer.

36:10.137 --> 36:13.015
They said I wouldn't get trouble
if I told the truth.

36:13.057 --> 36:14.649
Amy was the go-to gal

36:14.697 --> 36:18.167
when the Martin interplanetary folk
were short of mad money.

36:19.857 --> 36:22.769
I'll see to it that you're given full immunity.

36:24.057 --> 36:26.855
I met Frank at Maxwell's one happy hour.

36:26.897 --> 36:30.014
Businessmen hung there till their trains left,

36:30.057 --> 36:33.254
so me and my friends
would go there for free drinks,

36:33.297 --> 36:36.812
try to score a job
from some sloshed executive.

36:36.857 --> 36:39.087
- Was Martin sloshed?
- No.

36:39.137 --> 36:42.049
He was always in control.

36:42.097 --> 36:43.894
Little did I know.

36:43.937 --> 36:47.247
He got off on eroto-asphyxiation.

36:47.297 --> 36:49.128
Strangling girls for kicks.

36:49.177 --> 36:53.056
- Did he ever try that with you?
- Hell, no.

36:53.097 --> 36:57.932
See... I don't mind
a little recreational spankies,

36:57.977 --> 37:00.047
tying up, playful stuff,

37:00.097 --> 37:02.930
so he quickly lost interest in me.

37:05.057 --> 37:10.051
He liked the thrill of controlling women
who struggled against him,

37:10.097 --> 37:11.735
the sick bastard.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.655
He said that he and his homeboy, Tucker,

37:15.697 --> 37:18.848
used to tie farm girls to trees

37:19.857 --> 37:22.735
and then sit in the woods just laughing,

37:22.777 --> 37:25.530
getting off on watching them struggle.

37:26.657 --> 37:29.455
- Martin was from Tennessee too.
- Yeah.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.853
But they never got into trouble
because they were minors.

37:32.897 --> 37:36.048
And, as he says,
'They were only coloured girls,'

37:36.097 --> 37:38.770
The chivalry part comes in
where they let them go

37:38.817 --> 37:41.968
rather than let them die
of exposure and humiliation.

37:42.817 --> 37:44.808
I know this is hard for you.

37:44.857 --> 37:47.576
But it doesn't help
with the murder of Layla Briggs.

37:47.617 --> 37:49.608
This will.

37:54.697 --> 37:57.894
- No, Frank, you called Tucker.
- He called me.

37:57.937 --> 38:01.168
No, Frank, you called.
8:22. You called him.

38:01.217 --> 38:05.256
I told you, that was about a problem
with the Tennessee regulators.

38:05.297 --> 38:07.128
As soon as I got to the office,

38:07.177 --> 38:10.453
I had my executive page Mr Tucker
to set up a meeting.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.965
Do you think we're from Pea Patch, Frank?

38:13.017 --> 38:17.215
Cos this isn't a farm but you are
in some pretty deep horse manure.

38:17.257 --> 38:22.377
The call that we're talking about
is at 8:22pm, Frank, not am.

38:22.417 --> 38:26.251
8:22 in the evening, New York City time.

38:26.297 --> 38:28.447
Like I say, my assistant will verify...

38:28.497 --> 38:31.807
Frank, stop with the CEO routine.
We're all plain folks.

38:31.857 --> 38:35.930
- Hey, you don't have to get nasty.
- Nasty?

38:37.817 --> 38:42.095
Nasty is putting out your cigarette
on your assistant's thigh.

38:42.137 --> 38:45.652
Nasty is cheating old ladies
from Tennessee out of their savings.

38:46.737 --> 38:49.809
And choking the air
out of Layla Briggs' windpipe,

38:49.857 --> 38:53.736
then leaving her corpse for
her mother to find, that's nasty.

38:53.777 --> 38:57.133
I will not participate any further
until I see my lawyer.

38:58.057 --> 39:02.016
You called him three hours ago.
He hasn't returned your call.

39:02.057 --> 39:04.446
You think he checked your credit?

39:04.737 --> 39:06.693
Sho-Ling has turned you in.

39:06.737 --> 39:09.205
Amy has turned you in.

39:09.257 --> 39:12.055
Looks like the rats have jumped ship, Frank.

39:12.097 --> 39:16.249
- You choked her, didn't you?
- No! I didn't choke her, Tucker did.

39:16.297 --> 39:20.210
- Because of the stolen diamonds?
- No, we didn't even know about that.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.725
It was strictly for kicks.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.127
For kicks?

39:26.177 --> 39:28.054
Yeah. I was doing her

39:28.857 --> 39:33.851
and Tucker started squeezing her throat,
just massaging it really.

39:34.457 --> 39:37.767
She liked it but then her eyes said stop.

39:37.817 --> 39:41.412
- Stop? So why didn't he?
- Er. I don...

39:41.457 --> 39:44.733
Oh, I don't know.
He'll claim it was for my benefit.

39:44.777 --> 39:46.768
But the truth,

39:48.097 --> 39:50.816
the truth is,
that was the biggest turn-on for him.

39:50.857 --> 39:53.451
Not the sex part,

39:53.497 --> 39:56.057
the seeing how far you can go.

39:56.097 --> 39:58.372
And he went all the way.

39:58.417 --> 40:01.454
- 'That's not what we heard,'
- 'What did you hear?'

40:01.497 --> 40:04.648
'Stuff about you
tying up the ladies down home,'

40:04.697 --> 40:06.608
' That was nothing,'

40:09.857 --> 40:11.609
Nothing?

40:11.657 --> 40:13.454
We were kids.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.453
15, 16.

40:15.497 --> 40:18.534
- You and Frankie?
- Minors.

40:18.577 --> 40:22.650
Besides, it's just the way it was then.
Down there.

40:23.457 --> 40:27.211
It's just a cultural difference,
torturing women?

40:27.257 --> 40:29.134
Torturing? Where d'you get that?

40:29.177 --> 40:32.647
With pleasure. They must've liked
being left out in the woods.

40:32.697 --> 40:35.211
The solitude, the mosquitoes.

40:35.257 --> 40:37.009
Broke the boredom.

40:38.057 --> 40:41.766
The boredom of sitting on a porch
eating watermelon and having babies?

40:43.817 --> 40:45.773
You're not a public defender.

40:45.817 --> 40:47.853
No.

40:47.897 --> 40:50.252
I'm Detective Jeffries.

40:50.297 --> 40:54.495
I only came in to see the redneck
under the facade of the New South.

40:56.417 --> 40:58.612
Now I'm kinda sorry I did.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.730
Oh, Martin rolled on him.

41:05.737 --> 41:08.854
- What did she mean?
- Sit down.

41:09.857 --> 41:12.849
- What the hell's that mean?
- You've been mirandised.

41:12.897 --> 41:16.606
If you write a statement,
it might help in mitigating your sentence,

41:16.657 --> 41:19.854
depending on whether the DA's office
will even entertain

41:19.897 --> 41:22.855
the option of a plea bargain,
which I doubt.

41:23.457 --> 41:26.096
What the hell is he talking about, son?

41:33.857 --> 41:36.291
That means you and Frank are gonna hang,

41:37.305 --> 41:43.396
