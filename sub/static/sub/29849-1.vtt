00:33.897 --> 00:35.665
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.737
The Producers of this picture
thought it would be only fair

00:41.171 --> 00:46.375
To give you ample warning of
what you are about to witness

00:46.943 --> 00:50.947
This motion picture contains
elements of horror,

00:51.014 --> 00:52.115
Terror,

00:52.182 --> 00:53.883
and.... Demonic possession.

00:55.784 --> 01:00.823
So, if you are of a weak
disposition or easily offended,

01:00.890 --> 01:03.592
please leave this screening at
once.

01:03.926 --> 01:09.064
The management will be more than
happy to refund your tickets.

01:13.936 --> 01:17.672
Have they gone?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.441
Good.

01:21.076 --> 01:25.780
Those of you who are brave
enough to stay

01:26.081 --> 01:28.950
You have been warned.

01:31.019 --> 01:33.087
So, without any further ado

01:33.154 --> 01:34.956
It is my pleasure,

01:35.023 --> 01:37.558
Or should I say displeasure?

01:37.625 --> 01:41.628
To present our feature
presentation...

03:26.864 --> 03:28.365
Have we passed Westwood Station?

03:28.432 --> 03:31.735
Oh, no, no, two more stops.

03:37.740 --> 03:42.545
No need to fret, pilgrim, just a
force of habit is all.

03:43.213 --> 03:46.283
Care for a gut warmer?

03:49.685 --> 03:51.888
Woah! Strong stuff!

03:51.954 --> 03:55.291
Takes some getting used to I
guess.

03:55.358 --> 03:57.794
George Walker

03:57.860 --> 03:59.362
Oh! George Walker?

03:59.429 --> 04:02.231
Not THE George Walker, the
American oil tycoon?

04:02.298 --> 04:05.001
I would have had you as being
much older.

04:05.068 --> 04:07.203
You're thinking of my Pa.

04:07.270 --> 04:09.072
Ah... so you are

04:09.138 --> 04:11.773
A Junior.

04:12.375 --> 04:14.910
I don't think I got your name.

04:14.976 --> 04:16.312
Jeffrey Bank.

04:16.379 --> 04:17.745
Pleasure, I'm sure.

04:17.813 --> 04:21.950
So, what's a Yank oil man doing
in this part of the world?

04:22.017 --> 04:24.319
I'm visiting an old friend from
my Oxford days

04:24.386 --> 04:29.157
He just acquired a 'Westwood
Manor'

04:29.224 --> 04:32.394
What? You didn't have me pegged
for an Oxford scholar?

04:32.461 --> 04:35.197
No no no... it's just Westwood
Manor

04:35.263 --> 04:37.199
Now that is interesting.

04:37.265 --> 04:38.699
Interesting how?

04:38.766 --> 04:41.236
Oh no its just... local gossip

04:41.303 --> 04:44.772
I wouldn't want to waste your
time with all that nonsense

04:44.839 --> 04:48.042
Well, until this train pulls
into Westwood Station

04:48.109 --> 04:50.211
I got all the time in the world

04:50.277 --> 04:53.080
Spin me your nonsense.

04:53.147 --> 04:54.482
Well then... I mean

04:54.548 --> 04:59.353
Westwood Manor has stood empty
for most of it's life

04:59.420 --> 05:00.720
People have come and gone

05:00.788 --> 05:03.823
But they've never stayed more
than a year or two.

05:03.890 --> 05:09.062
Then a few winters back a strange
individual took up residency

05:09.130 --> 05:10.697
He never went into the village

05:10.763 --> 05:12.799
He was something of a hermit

05:12.866 --> 05:14.267
And then, ah, well,

05:14.335 --> 05:16.703
The noises started

05:16.769 --> 05:19.706
And every night the noises got
louder,

05:19.772 --> 05:21.875
and more terrifying

05:21.941 --> 05:27.180
The villagers wouldn't even
leave their homes after nightfall

05:27.247 --> 05:29.115
And then, just as suddenly

05:29.182 --> 05:31.117
The noises stopped

05:31.184 --> 05:35.121
And the house stood silent and
empty once more.

05:35.188 --> 05:37.190
And the hermit? What became of
him?

05:37.257 --> 05:38.857
Well no one knows

05:38.924 --> 05:41.294
But the villagers were so
terrified...

05:41.361 --> 05:47.432
Even the bravest will not enter
that house to this day

05:47.500 --> 05:48.734
You can't try frightening me,

05:48.800 --> 05:53.438
You English folk are as slow as
a Sunday afternoon

05:53.505 --> 05:55.374
My station's just coming up

05:55.440 --> 06:00.811
It's been very nice passing a
bit of time with you.

06:00.878 --> 06:04.982
And, ah...

06:05.049 --> 06:07.752
Tread carefully, Mr Walker

06:07.818 --> 06:11.822
You're not in Texas any longer.

06:24.101 --> 06:25.802
Must you drive so fast?

06:25.870 --> 06:29.040
Cars are built for speed.

06:29.373 --> 06:31.875
No point driving if you're gonna
go slow.

06:31.942 --> 06:34.512
But you know that it makes me
nervous.

06:34.579 --> 06:36.380
We're all going to die,
Elizabeth

06:36.447 --> 06:40.116
The one thing we can choose is
if we do it with style.

06:40.183 --> 06:44.187
And crashing into a ditch is
with style?

06:45.623 --> 06:47.724
Very well

06:49.326 --> 06:51.127
Thank you.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.333
What's the matter?

06:56.399 --> 06:59.169
You've barely spoken since we
left London

06:59.236 --> 07:01.804
Nothing, I'm fine

07:01.870 --> 07:06.108
You're a terrible liar, you know
that?

07:06.543 --> 07:10.346
I wish we weren't coming this
weekend.

07:10.412 --> 07:12.982
Why?

07:13.048 --> 07:15.150
What are you afraid of?

07:15.217 --> 07:18.153
What if nobody likes me?

07:18.220 --> 07:20.389
How could anyone dislike you?

07:20.456 --> 07:22.591
You're simply charming.

07:22.658 --> 07:24.260
Well I'm not exactly...

07:24.326 --> 07:27.329
Not exactly what?

07:27.529 --> 07:30.499
I'm just a solicitor's secretary

07:30.566 --> 07:34.002
I'm not in the oil business,
or...

07:34.068 --> 07:37.205
A famous tennis player

07:37.573 --> 07:41.509
A famous tennis player who hasn't won
a match in the last two tournaments

07:41.577 --> 07:43.211
At that rate my dear

07:43.278 --> 07:47.915
You're far more successful than
me.

08:27.521 --> 08:29.289
Christine.

08:29.356 --> 08:31.391
Hello George.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.393
I didn't see you board the train
at Paddington

08:34.460 --> 08:36.195
Been some time.

08:36.261 --> 08:38.097
Hasn't it?

08:38.164 --> 08:40.265
How have you been keeping?

08:40.332 --> 08:42.902
Just fine, thank you.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.338
Well you look as pretty as a pie
supper

08:45.404 --> 08:46.939
How are you?

08:47.006 --> 08:49.008
Better now.

08:49.075 --> 08:50.443
Shall we head inside?

08:50.509 --> 08:52.678
Inquire about a car?

08:52.745 --> 08:54.447
After you.

08:54.513 --> 08:55.481
Let me take your bags.

08:55.548 --> 08:58.149
I'm sure I'll manage.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.503
It's magnificent

09:18.570 --> 09:20.538
And it's all Victor's?

09:20.605 --> 09:24.542
Yes, his father was a very rich
man

09:24.609 --> 09:26.511
They despised each other.

09:26.578 --> 09:27.645
Why?

09:27.712 --> 09:30.080
He disagreed with Victor's
lifestyle

09:30.147 --> 09:32.082
Too much time in restaurants and
clubs

09:32.149 --> 09:34.618
And not in libraries and
university

09:34.686 --> 09:36.086
But then he died

09:36.153 --> 09:39.022
And left Victor a small fortune.

09:39.089 --> 09:41.225
Can't say he's been spending it
wisely

09:41.291 --> 09:42.393
What do you mean?

09:42.459 --> 09:44.395
Victor is a creature of appetite

09:44.461 --> 09:47.231
But he also has a very short
attention span.

09:47.297 --> 09:49.433
Fads come and go.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.602
A few months ago it was all
about Polo

09:51.668 --> 09:53.970
Then it was hot-air
ballooning...

09:54.036 --> 09:56.507
And now it's this house.

09:56.573 --> 09:59.375
God knows what will be next.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.178
It's rather sinister isn't it?

10:36.244 --> 10:39.147
Yes... I suppose it is.

10:39.214 --> 10:43.218
Come. Let's go find our host.

11:14.415 --> 11:16.182
Hello??

11:16.249 --> 11:18.786
Freddie, old boy!!

11:18.853 --> 11:20.521
Well, what do you think?!

11:20.588 --> 11:22.656
I love what you've done with the
place

11:22.723 --> 11:24.692
You know you really should put
me in touch with a decorator

11:24.758 --> 11:27.260
My apartment has far too many
upright walls.

11:27.327 --> 11:29.128
Ha ha! Oh very funny

11:29.195 --> 11:30.230
How are we?

11:30.296 --> 11:31.564
Oh much better now that you're
here

11:31.631 --> 11:33.266
And this must be... Elizabeth

11:33.333 --> 11:34.234
Elizabeth Barton

11:34.300 --> 11:35.001
How do you do?

11:35.068 --> 11:36.269
Very good to see you!

11:36.336 --> 11:37.237
This house is...

11:37.303 --> 11:38.338
Terrible.

11:38.404 --> 11:40.507
What on earth possessed you to
buy it?

11:40.573 --> 11:41.541
All in good time, but first

11:41.608 --> 11:44.209
Let me show you to your
quarters.

11:44.276 --> 11:46.144
Then we can crack on with some
serious drinking

11:46.211 --> 11:49.348
Don't mind if I do!

11:59.525 --> 12:02.628
The Master Bedroom!

12:03.428 --> 12:05.364
How cosy.

12:05.430 --> 12:06.698
It's a little run down

12:06.765 --> 12:08.600
But the bed seems to be in
perfectly good order.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.669
Thank you.

12:10.736 --> 12:12.371
Well, we'll leave you in peace!

12:12.437 --> 12:14.105
Freddie, I'll show you your room

12:14.171 --> 12:16.475
Drinks in about... half an hour.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.678
Just this way, Freddie

13:11.995 --> 13:14.463
George! You big American
bastard!

13:14.531 --> 13:15.865
Wonderful to see you again!

13:15.932 --> 13:17.834
You too.

13:17.901 --> 13:20.202
What the hell happened here?

13:20.269 --> 13:22.237
It's a work in progress old boy.

13:22.304 --> 13:25.174
And my dear sister... how are
we?

13:25.240 --> 13:26.308
Vicky.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.278
Um, is something wrong with my
hand?

13:29.345 --> 13:31.246
Oh my god you're right!

13:31.313 --> 13:33.415
Drinks in ten minutes everyone.

13:33.482 --> 13:36.485
Let me show you to your quarters

13:36.552 --> 13:39.655
Mind the, uh, debris...

13:48.262 --> 13:49.230
Not ready yet?

13:49.297 --> 13:50.431
Oh! You startled me

13:50.498 --> 13:53.735
I'm sorry... need help with my
cufflinks.

13:53.801 --> 13:56.404
Rather silly, a grown man who
still can't do his own.

13:56.471 --> 13:58.306
Luckily you have me to help.

13:58.373 --> 14:00.608
Yes... about that.

14:00.675 --> 14:03.578
I was wondering if you'd always
like to help me with my cufflinks.

14:03.645 --> 14:05.345
What do you mean?

14:05.413 --> 14:08.816
I'm asking you to marry me you
little fool.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.685
Really?

14:10.752 --> 14:12.352
Yes. Not the most romantic way
to ask, I know

14:12.419 --> 14:14.756
But there you go.

14:14.822 --> 14:16.858
Well?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.825
I don't know what to say...

14:18.893 --> 14:21.294
Well... yes of course

14:21.361 --> 14:22.929
Yes!

14:22.997 --> 14:24.297
Good girl.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.633
Now that's settled you should
really get changed.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.570
Victor hates to be kept waiting.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.420
Here we are.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.587
Thank you

14:48.654 --> 14:51.657
And Bourbon, no junk for our...

14:51.724 --> 14:52.992
Transatlantic friend

14:53.059 --> 14:54.460
Now you're talking!

14:54.527 --> 14:55.995
Where's Freddie?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.430
Is he late?

14:57.496 --> 15:00.298
I believe he's changing

15:01.367 --> 15:03.536
I heard he's got a new pet

15:03.602 --> 15:06.371
Now now Christine we must not -

15:06.438 --> 15:08.674
Ah, speak of the devil!

15:08.741 --> 15:09.742
Look what the cat dragged in!

15:09.809 --> 15:11.710
Hello old boy, it's been a
while.

15:11.777 --> 15:13.846
Ain't it just

15:13.913 --> 15:15.714
Christine... a pleasure

15:15.780 --> 15:20.385
I'm afraid I'm simply too weary
from my journey to stand.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.520
Of course, how rude of me

15:22.587 --> 15:24.055
This is Elizabeth Barton

15:24.122 --> 15:27.859
Elizabeth, this is George
Walker, Junior

15:27.926 --> 15:29.994
Pleasure to meet you little lady

15:30.061 --> 15:31.696
And allow me to introduce

15:31.763 --> 15:34.531
my darling sister, Christine.

15:34.599 --> 15:35.767
How do you do?

15:35.834 --> 15:39.369
I'll be right as rain as soon as
I finish this

15:39.436 --> 15:40.437
And Elizabeth...?

15:40.504 --> 15:41.472
Oh, no thank you

15:41.538 --> 15:44.976
I don't drink.

15:47.511 --> 15:50.347
How very proper.

15:52.716 --> 15:54.485
Well isn't this nice!

15:54.551 --> 15:55.986
All of us, back together again

15:56.053 --> 15:58.088
Like the good old days!

15:58.155 --> 16:01.759
Here's to a weekend in the
country

16:01.825 --> 16:04.427
Cheers!

16:16.773 --> 16:18.107
Is this safe to eat?

16:18.175 --> 16:21.611
Haven't had the chance to hire
any staff I'm afraid.

16:21.677 --> 16:26.381
This is the product of my
afternoon in the kitchen

16:26.449 --> 16:29.351
Oh god, well in that case this
is a miracle.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.787
Well Victor

16:30.853 --> 16:32.021
You may have let us down in the
kitchen

16:32.088 --> 16:34.356
But you certainly made up for it
in the cellar

16:34.422 --> 16:37.894
This 1895 Chateaux Palmer is a
wonderful wine

16:37.960 --> 16:39.095
Well drink up everyone

16:39.162 --> 16:42.731
there's plenty more where that
came from.

16:42.798 --> 16:46.368
Oh, I am sorry there wasn't
anything apart from water for you.

16:46.434 --> 16:48.837
Water's fine, thank you.

16:48.904 --> 16:49.905
I must say, Elizabeth

16:49.971 --> 16:52.040
It's a pleasure to finally meet
you.

16:52.107 --> 16:54.643
Freddie's normally so shy about
introducing us to his friends.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.511
Well I've been so busy with
practice lately

16:56.578 --> 16:58.814
I've hardly been off the court.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.715
You know I think there's a
tennis court

17:00.782 --> 17:02.117
somewhere on the grounds

17:02.184 --> 17:04.451
Maybe we could have a game
tomorrow

17:04.518 --> 17:08.521
By the sounds of it you need all
the practice you can get!

17:09.957 --> 17:11.724
To hell with you.

17:11.791 --> 17:13.694
So how did you two meet?

17:13.761 --> 17:16.396
Arthur Brown's Christmas party
drinks.

17:16.463 --> 17:18.933
You've been keeping her hidden
since Christmas?!

17:18.999 --> 17:20.134
Poor show.

17:20.201 --> 17:21.602
Well, didn't want to give you
any ideas

17:21.669 --> 17:23.637
Did I, old boy?

17:23.704 --> 17:25.940
And what do you do?

17:26.006 --> 17:27.040
Christine.

17:27.107 --> 17:29.710
What? Can't I ask her anything?

17:29.777 --> 17:30.476
A secretary.

17:30.543 --> 17:31.812
A mute one, no doubt?

17:31.879 --> 17:34.581
For a solicitor.

17:35.515 --> 17:39.485
And what does being a
solicitor's secretary involve?

17:39.853 --> 17:42.856
Mostly arranging meetings,

17:42.922 --> 17:46.926
and typing letters. That sort of
thing.

17:50.730 --> 17:53.700
But my real passion is writing

17:53.766 --> 17:55.567
Well what sort of writing?

17:55.635 --> 17:58.171
Are we in the presence of the
next Jane Austen?

17:58.238 --> 17:59.605
No I don't think so

17:59.671 --> 18:00.639
More Shelley than Austen

18:00.706 --> 18:02.108
Oh please...

18:02.175 --> 18:04.143
Well come on, tell us more!

18:04.210 --> 18:05.844
It's not very interesting

18:05.911 --> 18:09.047
Oh no it sounds simply
fascinating

18:09.115 --> 18:11.850
We all wanna know!

18:12.918 --> 18:15.988
Well... it's a ghost story of
sorts

18:16.054 --> 18:20.826
And what happens in this ghost
story of sorts?

18:20.893 --> 18:23.695
It's about a girl.

18:23.762 --> 18:26.530
A little girl who is raised in
an orphanage

18:26.597 --> 18:29.567
And she's haunted by ghosts

18:29.634 --> 18:33.171
Only as she grows up, and the
story continues

18:33.238 --> 18:37.074
She realises that ghosts aren't
the ones to fear.

18:38.277 --> 18:42.480
Well what are the ones to fear?

18:44.215 --> 18:47.652
The humans.

18:51.621 --> 18:54.624
Oh! I am so sorry
Elizabeth!

18:54.691 --> 18:55.558
Oh no it's fine!! No don't
worry...

18:55.625 --> 18:58.895
No don't... don't!

19:00.298 --> 19:01.498
Don't worry Victor

19:01.564 --> 19:04.434
It was only a cheap dress.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.755
Is everything alright Elizabeth?

19:26.822 --> 19:29.159
I'm... I'm fine

19:29.225 --> 19:33.128
It was an honest accident

19:35.597 --> 19:39.601
Just let me clean myself up.

19:53.614 --> 19:54.882
...eventually we reached the
summit

19:54.950 --> 19:59.188
Even though we walked downhill -

20:00.088 --> 20:03.325
Elizabeth, I am so sorry for
before

20:03.392 --> 20:06.060
Not to worry

20:07.295 --> 20:10.098
So... Christine

20:10.164 --> 20:12.133
I don't think I heard

20:12.200 --> 20:14.969
What is it that you do exactly?

20:16.371 --> 20:17.972
Do??

20:18.039 --> 20:21.842
Well darling, I do this!

20:22.210 --> 20:24.611
And you do it better than anyone
else could!

20:24.678 --> 20:26.713
Oh you're too kind

20:26.780 --> 20:28.915
How very... rewarding

20:28.982 --> 20:30.351
I'm sure.

20:30.418 --> 20:33.253
Oooh! Christine you better watch
out

20:33.321 --> 20:37.591
This one's got claws!

20:37.657 --> 20:40.560
Shut up Victor.

20:41.428 --> 20:43.330
If I may be so bold

20:43.397 --> 20:45.631
I'd like to make a toast.

20:45.698 --> 20:49.835
Oh, everyone, charge your
glasses!

21:03.149 --> 21:04.383
Proceed.

21:04.451 --> 21:07.119
Well I wasn't planning on saying
anything just yet

21:07.186 --> 21:08.788
But, why not?

21:08.854 --> 21:10.856
Seeing as we're all here

21:10.923 --> 21:14.226
And maybe this wine has got the
better of my senses

21:14.293 --> 21:16.896
But we're engaged

21:16.962 --> 21:18.830
We are to be married

21:18.897 --> 21:20.166
I say!

21:20.232 --> 21:21.766
Congratulations

21:21.833 --> 21:23.001
Congratulations

21:23.068 --> 21:24.936
Thank you

21:25.003 --> 21:28.106
Congratulations.

21:40.852 --> 21:41.419
Christine.

21:41.486 --> 21:43.188
Hello again.

21:43.254 --> 21:44.389
Did you receive my letters?

21:44.456 --> 21:45.656
Yes...

21:45.722 --> 21:46.924
Well I didn't get a reply

21:46.991 --> 21:49.394
No. I thought it would be
kindest that way.

21:49.461 --> 21:50.528
Kindest?

21:50.627 --> 21:53.198
What would you know about
kindness?

21:53.264 --> 21:55.099
Well the last time we saw each
other

21:55.165 --> 21:57.301
You were telling me you never
wanted to see me again

21:57.368 --> 22:00.938
Can't a man change his mind?

22:01.004 --> 22:02.873
I must say...

22:02.940 --> 22:04.274
When I read your first letter

22:04.341 --> 22:06.076
I was very surprised when I got
to the end

22:06.143 --> 22:07.311
and saw it was from you.

22:07.377 --> 22:09.712
Why? Who else would it be from?

22:09.780 --> 22:10.780
Does it matter?

22:10.848 --> 22:11.548
They were all signed

22:11.614 --> 22:15.718
George Walker Junior.

22:16.886 --> 22:20.823
Don't call me Junior.

22:20.890 --> 22:22.459
I must say, George

22:22.526 --> 22:24.760
That's a very big knife.

22:24.827 --> 22:29.298
I do hope you're not trying to
compensate for something.

22:32.468 --> 22:35.104
How about a game of bridge?

22:35.171 --> 22:36.705
No no...

22:36.772 --> 22:41.043
I have specially arranged
entertainment for us this evening.

22:42.911 --> 22:44.447
What time is it?

22:44.514 --> 22:47.150
Nine twenty-five

22:47.216 --> 22:49.485
Good. She should be here soon
then.

22:49.552 --> 22:51.119
Who should be here soon?

22:51.186 --> 22:54.222
All will be explained shortly.

22:54.289 --> 22:59.794
Yes... but let us retire to the
games room!

23:10.105 --> 23:11.173
Well, sit, sit

23:11.239 --> 23:13.375
Make yourselves comfortable.

23:13.441 --> 23:15.510
Oh, would anyone like a drink?

23:15.577 --> 23:17.912
Whiskey, neat.

23:17.978 --> 23:19.747
I'll have one too, with ice.

23:19.813 --> 23:21.516
I think we have some sherry...

23:21.583 --> 23:22.750
Sherry?

23:22.816 --> 23:23.451
Sherry.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.152
Sherry... Sherry?

23:25.219 --> 23:26.754
Sherry? No I...

23:26.820 --> 23:29.123
Elizabeth doesn't drink,
remember?

23:29.190 --> 23:31.158
Of course, how silly of me

23:31.225 --> 23:34.228
I'll just fetch you some water.

23:35.828 --> 23:37.431
Whiskey, no junk.

23:37.498 --> 23:41.368
So old boy. Save the
theatrics...

23:41.435 --> 23:43.002
What's this all about?

23:43.069 --> 23:44.704
Well...

23:48.841 --> 23:52.845
If you're so determined to ruin
my fun

23:55.381 --> 23:59.319
This is no ordinary house.

23:59.385 --> 24:05.158
This house was owned by

24:05.225 --> 24:08.394
Ichabod Quinn!

24:10.996 --> 24:13.765
Who?

24:15.867 --> 24:19.972
I'm not sure how much you know
about the world of the paranormal

24:20.038 --> 24:22.241
But over the past few months
I've become

24:22.307 --> 24:24.209
quite fascinated by it

24:24.276 --> 24:27.479
What, ghosts and monsters? That
sort of nonsense?

24:27.546 --> 24:29.248
Exactly.

24:29.314 --> 24:31.516
But I wouldn't call it nonsense.

24:31.583 --> 24:36.221
What's all this got to do with
this Ichabod character?

24:36.288 --> 24:38.557
Mr Quinn was one of the greatest
occultists

24:38.624 --> 24:39.991
who ever lived.

24:40.057 --> 24:45.096
He pushed the boundaries of
magic to its utmost limit

24:45.162 --> 24:49.967
Going further than anyone else
before

24:52.436 --> 24:55.506
He was also a painter

24:55.573 --> 25:00.311
He would take various substances in
order to connect with the other side

25:00.378 --> 25:03.381
Once in a trance-like state, he
would begin

25:03.447 --> 25:05.683
to paint what he saw.

25:05.750 --> 25:13.957
But when he fell gravely ill, he wrote to his mentor
that he was close to acheiving his life's work

25:14.024 --> 25:23.133
"After years of searching... my
quest has come to an end...

25:23.199 --> 25:30.540
I have found the birthplace...
of desire and destruction

25:30.607 --> 25:35.645
Tonight, under the eye of the
moon

25:35.712 --> 25:41.418
I will pull back the veil of
this world

25:41.484 --> 25:48.223
And go to the utter blackness

25:48.290 --> 25:53.495
I am close, so very close.

25:54.563 --> 25:59.168
Close to what?

25:59.234 --> 26:03.037
A gateway to the other side

26:03.104 --> 26:05.574
Then one day he vanished

26:05.641 --> 26:08.076
Never to be seen again

26:08.142 --> 26:10.945
Legend has it that if a séance
is conducted

26:11.012 --> 26:14.315
one can raise his tormented
soul.

26:14.382 --> 26:15.651
Are you suggesting we...

26:15.718 --> 26:17.352
Yes!

26:17.418 --> 26:21.556
That we perform a séance tonight,
and we make contact with Mr Quinn.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.925
But why would anyone do such a
thing?

26:24.992 --> 26:27.061
Why? Why not?

26:27.128 --> 26:29.163
Beats bridge at any rate.

26:29.230 --> 26:32.933
Do you even know how to conduct
one?

26:32.999 --> 26:37.104
No... not exactly. But from what I
read it's not as hard as one may think.

26:37.170 --> 26:39.474
All we require is a medium.

26:39.540 --> 26:40.907
A what now?

26:40.974 --> 26:44.945
Someone who has the power to
communicate with the dead.

26:45.011 --> 26:47.013
Very shrewd Elizabeth.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.315
A medium will soon be joining
us,

26:48.382 --> 26:51.084
one that has been personally
recommended to me.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.586
Well, who is this medium?

26:52.652 --> 26:54.987
She's supposed to be very good,
in fact

26:55.055 --> 26:57.990
She put old Percy King in touch
with his deceased father

26:58.057 --> 27:02.261
in order to get the combination
to his safe.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.196
I assume it worked?

27:04.263 --> 27:07.133
Take a look at his new mansion

27:11.705 --> 27:14.006
If I'm not very much mistaken

27:14.073 --> 27:17.309
That will be her now.

27:22.681 --> 27:25.217
You're looking a little uneasy,
George.

27:25.284 --> 27:27.353
Another drink? Settle your
nerves?

27:27.420 --> 27:28.621
Please

27:28.687 --> 27:31.590
George Walker Junior, afraid?

27:31.657 --> 27:35.226
Now that is a first.

27:35.293 --> 27:37.596
I just think its dumb as dirt to
go messing with things

27:37.663 --> 27:40.331
we don't know diddly-squat
about.

27:40.398 --> 27:44.402
Well I think it's a ripping
idea.

27:46.204 --> 27:49.207
Here's to the paranormal.

27:52.343 --> 27:54.479
Ladies and Gentlemen...

27:54.546 --> 27:58.683
Madame Bellrose!

27:59.818 --> 28:02.019
Good evening!

28:02.085 --> 28:03.420
Let me introduce you to -

28:03.488 --> 28:06.791
Mr Turner, the tennis player

28:06.858 --> 28:08.091
Ah, yes...

28:08.158 --> 28:12.529
And you must be Mr Walker
Junior, the oil man

28:12.596 --> 28:14.531
Yeah, but don't call me
Junior...

28:14.598 --> 28:15.699
Ms Hall

28:15.766 --> 28:17.601
And Ms Barton, I presume

28:17.668 --> 28:19.236
Wrong way round

28:19.303 --> 28:21.405
Ah well, can't get them all
right.

28:21.472 --> 28:23.607
How do you already know our
names?

28:23.674 --> 28:27.678
Oh... a name is a name is a
name...

28:33.149 --> 28:35.051
Curious...

28:35.117 --> 28:36.219
What's curious?

28:36.285 --> 28:39.722
Is everything alright Madame
Bellrose?

28:39.790 --> 28:41.724
Oh yes, perfectly fine

28:41.791 --> 28:43.759
Just... a feeling.

28:43.826 --> 28:45.695
What kind of feeling?

28:45.761 --> 28:48.164
Oh, probably nothing

28:48.231 --> 28:52.602
These old houses are full of
stories and lives

28:52.668 --> 28:55.070
Would you like a drink Madame
Bellrose?

28:55.136 --> 28:58.273
Well, if you offered me a dry
martini...

28:58.340 --> 28:59.742
I'd have a dry martini!

28:59.809 --> 29:03.679
Of course.

29:14.589 --> 29:19.261
So, Ms Bellrose, tell us

29:19.327 --> 29:23.665
When did you realise you had
these... remarkable powers?

29:23.732 --> 29:28.703
Well, it was on my sixth birthday,
and I was playing hide and seek

29:28.770 --> 29:31.238
with some other children in the
woods

29:31.305 --> 29:34.475
And I'd just found a rather good
hiding place

29:34.542 --> 29:36.777
in an old oak tree.

29:36.845 --> 29:40.648
Little did I know that this
particular tree was home

29:40.714 --> 29:45.118
to a surprisingly aggressive
magpie

29:45.185 --> 29:48.355
Well, on his return he was very
displeased

29:48.422 --> 29:52.560
to see a grubby six year-old
hiding in his tree.

29:52.626 --> 29:55.428
And this beastly bird started
pecking me

29:55.496 --> 29:56.830
and attacking me

29:56.897 --> 29:59.265
and I misplaced my footing

29:59.332 --> 30:02.335
and down I fell, crashing to the
ground.

30:02.402 --> 30:05.405
The next thing I knew, I was in
bed

30:05.471 --> 30:06.806
with a bandage round my head

30:06.873 --> 30:09.542
sporting two missing teeth,

30:09.609 --> 30:13.246
and the ability to speak to the
dead!

30:16.616 --> 30:19.519
What a fascinating tale!

30:19.586 --> 30:23.155
And does anybody else in your
family possess these abilities?

30:23.221 --> 30:25.490
Second sight is not like curly
hair my dear

30:25.557 --> 30:28.895
It's not hereditary.

30:28.962 --> 30:32.731
Is there any chance... I mean
could it be dangerous

30:32.798 --> 30:35.734
to meddle with these sorts of
powers?

30:35.801 --> 30:40.172
I do not consider myself a
meddler!

30:40.238 --> 30:42.240
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
offend.

30:42.307 --> 30:45.477
Ah don't worry, don't apologise.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.349
Oh, I congratulate you on your
dry martini!

30:51.415 --> 30:53.785
Thank you.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.187
Well like anything exciting,

30:56.253 --> 30:58.456
there's always a degree of
danger.

30:58.522 --> 31:00.725
But, no more so than...

31:00.791 --> 31:02.460
slipping on ice,

31:02.526 --> 31:05.763
or burning yourself with a
match.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.467
So you've never had a bad
experience?

31:09.533 --> 31:13.537
I've slipped, but never fallen.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.576
There you are George. There's
nothing to fear.

31:18.643 --> 31:21.712
Forgive me, Victor, but this is
an enormous stick-up,

31:21.779 --> 31:23.146
ain't it?

31:23.213 --> 31:25.750
You know you actually had me
going for a second there.

31:25.816 --> 31:27.885
Pardon?

31:27.952 --> 31:30.487
You can't really be buying this?

31:30.553 --> 31:32.656
This... what?

31:32.722 --> 31:35.258
This... Hogwash!

31:35.325 --> 31:39.329
Do you think you know the world
so well, Mr Walker?

31:39.396 --> 31:40.664
Just 'cos a chicken's got wings

31:40.730 --> 31:42.632
don't mean it can fly.

31:42.699 --> 31:44.501
What on earth does that mean?

31:44.567 --> 31:48.905
It means, I ain't taking part in
this sham any longer

31:48.972 --> 31:51.240
It's fine, Mr Walker

31:51.306 --> 31:54.343
to be a little afraid.

31:55.577 --> 31:58.280
I ain't yella

31:58.347 --> 31:59.915
Oh do pipe down George,

31:59.983 --> 32:03.385
you're ruining all our fun.

32:04.687 --> 32:07.790
Well I'm game. If everyone else
is.

32:07.856 --> 32:10.492
Great show! Christine?

32:10.559 --> 32:13.294
Oh why not...

32:13.361 --> 32:15.463
Elizabeth?

32:15.531 --> 32:18.366
I can't say I'm not a little
nervous about the idea...

32:18.433 --> 32:19.835
But what about your novel?

32:19.902 --> 32:23.671
You're writing a ghost story.
Simply think of this as...

32:23.738 --> 32:25.007
research.

32:25.074 --> 32:28.476
Yes... and I thought the ghosts
weren't the ones to fear

32:28.543 --> 32:31.913
Remember?

32:31.979 --> 32:35.383
Come on, it's just a bit of fun.

32:38.019 --> 32:39.420
Very well.

32:39.487 --> 32:41.689
Splendiferous!

32:41.756 --> 32:45.760
Well... just you then George.

32:49.130 --> 32:53.333
Fine! Why the hell not?

32:55.368 --> 32:58.305
I'm in the minority here
anyways.

32:58.371 --> 33:00.440
Let's get this over and done
with.

33:00.507 --> 33:02.309
Aha! What a riot!

33:02.375 --> 33:04.845
Madame Bellrose, is there
anything else you need

33:04.911 --> 33:06.580
which I haven't already laid
out?

33:06.646 --> 33:12.586
No, Mr Hall, you've done very
well at following my instructions.

33:12.652 --> 33:18.390
Now, if you wouldn't mind taking
your places

33:39.578 --> 33:45.885
Now, place your hands on the
table, like so.

33:45.951 --> 33:49.521
Make sure your fingers are
touching

33:49.587 --> 33:50.755
Very good.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.791
Now I ask you do not speak

33:52.857 --> 33:55.460
or make any sudden movements,

33:55.527 --> 33:59.764
and try to clear your mind of
any thoughts.

33:59.831 --> 34:02.033
You want us to think of nothing?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.035
Should be easy for you, Victor.

34:04.102 --> 34:08.106
Yes, clear your mind, it makes
for a better connection.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.708
Is it likely that we'll make
contact?

34:10.775 --> 34:13.744
I can't promise anything...

34:13.812 --> 34:17.380
but if we do, I ask you do not
break the circle.

34:17.447 --> 34:19.550
Do you understand?

34:19.616 --> 34:22.452
Yes

34:22.518 --> 34:26.657
Right, we're ready.

34:26.723 --> 34:33.063
Spirits, we bring you gifts from
life into death.

34:33.130 --> 34:38.400
Commune with us! And move
amongst us.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.172
Is that rotten bread?

34:42.239 --> 34:44.607
Yes, my dear, it enhances the
flavour

34:44.674 --> 34:47.077
Spirits have very weakened taste
buds.

34:47.143 --> 34:49.846
Now don't interrupt again.

34:52.181 --> 34:57.085
Spirits, we bring you gifts from
life into death.

34:57.153 --> 35:01.423
Commune with us, and move
amongst us.

35:03.192 --> 35:06.929
Maybe they've got food
poisoning...

35:06.996 --> 35:09.431
Do you see us, beloved one?

35:12.001 --> 35:15.004
Spirits, can you hear us?

35:22.744 --> 35:25.914
Is there anyone here who wishes
to make contact

35:25.981 --> 35:28.583
with someone from the other
side?

35:28.650 --> 35:30.451
Yes

35:30.517 --> 35:36.590
I wish to make contact with Mr
Ichabod Quinn.

35:36.657 --> 35:41.129
Spirits of the past, move
amongst us

35:41.196 --> 35:45.133
Mr Ichabod Quinn, be guided by
the light of this world

35:45.200 --> 35:49.703
and visit upon us.

35:56.810 --> 36:00.814
Is that you, Mr Quinn?

36:03.650 --> 36:06.653
Can you see him?

36:06.719 --> 36:08.956
I can't see anyone.

36:09.023 --> 36:13.160
Look closely, can't you see?

36:17.864 --> 36:20.934
I can see clearly...

36:21.000 --> 36:24.671
A pale man, in a black suit

36:24.737 --> 36:28.274
headed towards us.

36:28.341 --> 36:32.544
He's coming this way.

36:34.247 --> 36:37.116
Is that you, Mr Quinn?

36:37.183 --> 36:38.817
This is all just -

36:38.884 --> 36:43.522
Don't break the circle!

36:43.588 --> 36:47.592
Come! Come again!

36:49.795 --> 36:54.566
Come forward...

36:54.633 --> 36:57.069
Oh!

36:58.636 --> 37:02.807
But your eyes!

37:02.874 --> 37:06.811
What's happened to your eyes!?

37:06.877 --> 37:10.815
No!! No no no!! Go back!

37:10.881 --> 37:14.885
Go back!!

37:29.300 --> 37:31.668
Madame Bellrose?

37:33.903 --> 37:35.638
What on earth is going on?

37:35.705 --> 37:39.142
Is she alright?

37:39.843 --> 37:45.882
This house... will become your
tomb.

37:45.949 --> 37:50.653
Your flesh will be torn, your
bones crushed to dust

37:50.720 --> 37:57.293
and your souls extracted to a
painful and terrifying eternity

37:57.360 --> 37:59.095
What the hell is she talking
about?

37:59.162 --> 38:01.064
When the dawn breaks

38:01.131 --> 38:04.666
The twelve kings and twelve
dukes of Hell will be released

38:04.733 --> 38:08.670
upon this earth.

38:08.737 --> 38:12.341
Flames will engulf you

38:12.409 --> 38:16.145
and the great beast will rip you
limb from limb

38:16.211 --> 38:20.049
for all of time.

38:20.115 --> 38:23.751
They will sit upon the throne of
blood...

38:23.819 --> 38:29.124
in an Eden of pain!

38:47.108 --> 38:49.576
Careful!

38:57.151 --> 39:01.222
HERE COMES HELL!!

39:01.289 --> 39:03.590
My god!!

39:06.860 --> 39:10.864
Well I think another drink is in
order?

39:32.918 --> 39:35.221
She's still kicking.

39:35.287 --> 39:37.756
What happened to her?

39:37.823 --> 39:40.025
She must be having some kind of
seizure...

39:40.092 --> 39:42.228
or attack of the brain.

39:42.294 --> 39:45.231
She seemed to get stronger!?

39:45.297 --> 39:47.867
Is that even possible?

39:47.933 --> 39:50.702
Strong as a bull!

39:50.768 --> 39:53.938
So what do we do with her now?

39:54.006 --> 39:56.108
We should call for a doctor.

39:56.175 --> 39:58.910
This house has no line.

39:58.977 --> 40:02.981
We should drive to the village
then.

40:06.217 --> 40:10.221
I think she's trying to say say
something.

40:35.547 --> 40:37.915
My god!!!

40:47.823 --> 40:49.792
Freddie!!

40:49.859 --> 40:53.963
Quick! Put pressure on the
wound!

40:55.399 --> 40:57.800
George you just shot my guest!

40:57.867 --> 40:59.702
Whiskey!

41:03.105 --> 41:04.874
Deep breath, deep breath

41:04.941 --> 41:06.375
calm down.

41:06.442 --> 41:07.510
Drink that.

41:07.577 --> 41:08.945
You're going to be fine

41:09.011 --> 41:11.113
My serving arm!!

41:11.180 --> 41:16.885
Do you always bring a gun to a
dinner party!!??

41:27.929 --> 41:31.933
I think it might be time we made
ourselves scarce.

41:43.245 --> 41:44.379
It won't budge!

41:44.446 --> 41:47.982
Stand back!!

41:49.517 --> 41:51.219
Is there another way out?

41:51.286 --> 41:55.457
Yes, the rear door. This way!

41:58.993 --> 42:00.127
It can't be!

42:00.194 --> 42:06.000
I told you not to mess with this
paranormal shit!

42:08.535 --> 42:13.307
She can't see us... move back,
quietly

42:26.953 --> 42:30.356
Sorry!

42:48.574 --> 42:51.411
Don't mess with Texas.

42:51.477 --> 42:55.581
How much ammunition did you
bring?!

42:57.949 --> 43:00.652
Flee!!!!

43:00.720 --> 43:02.321
Freddie!!

43:05.624 --> 43:11.163
Drink! I need a drink.

43:11.229 --> 43:15.567
Just something to... take the
edge off.

43:26.310 --> 43:29.180
Christ!!

43:47.230 --> 43:50.367
Who's there?

43:55.538 --> 43:59.042
Please!

43:59.109 --> 44:00.577
Come on....

44:16.726 --> 44:19.629
Father?

44:20.663 --> 44:23.098
Father, is that really you?

44:23.165 --> 44:27.669
You have disappointed me, my
son.

44:27.736 --> 44:34.443
All my fortune I have worked so
hard for my entire life

44:34.510 --> 44:38.647
You are throwing my life's work
to the wind.

44:38.714 --> 44:45.987
On boat trips, and pony girls,
and holidays to India!

44:46.053 --> 44:48.990
And vintage champagne.

44:49.056 --> 44:52.460
What has become of your
potential?

44:52.527 --> 44:55.730
Father I'm sorry! I'm sorry...

44:55.797 --> 44:59.033
Ha ha ha!

44:59.100 --> 45:03.337
You cannot escape!!

45:03.404 --> 45:05.071
You will burn!!!

45:05.138 --> 45:08.208
Father, no!!!

45:24.724 --> 45:28.728
What kind of bloody house is
this!?

45:30.230 --> 45:32.064
Let me see your hand!

45:32.131 --> 45:33.700
It's nothing, stop fussing!

45:33.767 --> 45:36.235
Let me!

45:37.537 --> 45:39.238
We need to cut it off.

45:39.305 --> 45:43.509
Don't be stupid. It's just a
little infected.

45:45.846 --> 45:48.314
Dear God!!

45:54.553 --> 45:56.522
Freddie!!

46:58.382 --> 47:01.818
What... what's happening to me?

47:01.885 --> 47:03.554
What's happening to me?

47:03.620 --> 47:05.656
No, I'm shrinking! Victor I'm
shrinking!

47:05.722 --> 47:07.824
Victor, help me! I'm shrinking!

47:07.891 --> 47:10.293
Freddie!! George?? I'm
shrinking!!

47:10.359 --> 47:12.562
Why am I shrinking? Help!

47:12.628 --> 47:14.530
Help me! Why aren't you
helping!?

47:14.597 --> 47:20.269
Victor!!

47:20.336 --> 47:25.140
Why can't you hear me!? Victor!?
Freddie??

47:25.206 --> 47:27.710
Come on George, I know you can
hear me!

47:27.777 --> 47:30.880
Can't you hear me, George!?

47:30.947 --> 47:34.182
Please, please help! I'm down
here!!

47:34.249 --> 47:35.250
Can't you hear me!!??

47:35.317 --> 47:36.518
Please!!

47:36.585 --> 47:38.821
George I know you can hear me!
Any of you...

47:38.888 --> 47:39.755
Please!

47:45.794 --> 47:47.162
Elizabeth!! Please!

47:47.228 --> 47:48.863
Please will you help me?!

47:49.664 --> 47:51.333
Christine??

47:51.800 --> 47:53.668
What are you doing down there?

47:53.735 --> 47:56.236
Elizabeth please will you help??

47:56.303 --> 48:00.307
Elizabeth? Elizabeth... no!!

48:04.411 --> 48:07.381
Look everyone, I found
Christine!

48:07.448 --> 48:09.516
Gosh, she's so small!

48:09.583 --> 48:10.952
I didn't even notice she'd gone.

48:11.019 --> 48:12.486
What's she saying?

48:12.553 --> 48:14.755
I'm still here!

48:14.822 --> 48:16.757
So insignificant!

48:16.824 --> 48:17.858
Get rid of her!

48:17.925 --> 48:21.295
Yes... squash her!!

48:21.362 --> 48:24.531
Don't squash me, please, I'm not
insignificant!

48:26.000 --> 48:28.769
Squash her!!

49:02.902 --> 49:05.604
George?

49:05.671 --> 49:06.638
Christine?

49:06.705 --> 49:08.507
Thank god, you're safe.

49:08.573 --> 49:10.575
I've started to see things.

49:10.642 --> 49:12.778
I'm so afraid... will you protect
me?

49:12.844 --> 49:15.580
Of course I will, you know I
always will.

49:15.647 --> 49:17.849
Oh George, you're so kind.

49:17.916 --> 49:20.519
I was such a fool to ever give
you the ring back.

49:20.585 --> 49:23.254
God I can be so cruel...

49:23.320 --> 49:27.425
Every day this past year I've
regretted that decision.

49:28.492 --> 49:30.695
I've always loved you.

49:31.328 --> 49:33.932
I...

49:35.566 --> 49:37.702
Fuck me!!

49:46.877 --> 49:49.747
Kiss me George!!!

49:51.882 --> 49:55.552
Don't you love me, George!??

50:09.532 --> 50:11.968
So much for compensating for
something.

51:23.871 --> 51:26.908
This way.

51:37.517 --> 51:37.951
Christine!

51:38.018 --> 51:38.852
Victor!

51:38.919 --> 51:39.686
You scared the life out of me!

51:39.753 --> 51:40.153
God you gave me a fright!

51:40.220 --> 51:40.620
Shut up!

51:40.687 --> 51:42.856
In here!

51:45.457 --> 51:47.828
Quick, into the games room!

51:53.166 --> 51:54.867
It seems to be all-

51:55.901 --> 51:57.636
George!

51:57.703 --> 52:00.706
Stay back!

52:00.773 --> 52:02.675
What the bloody hell do you
think you're doing?!

52:02.741 --> 52:04.643
Stop talking and do as I say

52:04.710 --> 52:08.379
Or I will gun you down like a
dog in the street.

52:09.181 --> 52:11.016
Sit.

52:23.728 --> 52:25.830
What's gotten into you?

52:25.897 --> 52:28.167
Ain't a question of what's
gotten into me.

52:28.234 --> 52:31.436
It's a question of what may have
gotten into you.

52:31.502 --> 52:35.073
These spirits, or whatever you
want to call them

52:35.139 --> 52:37.175
Can take on the form of us.

52:37.242 --> 52:39.978
We're not evil spirits, George,
we're human.

52:40.044 --> 52:41.579
Now whatever the hell this is,

52:41.646 --> 52:43.580
it's trying to play games with
us.

52:43.647 --> 52:45.850
It wants to beat us.

52:45.917 --> 52:48.752
You have to believe me.

52:50.154 --> 52:52.589
Maybe you're telling the truth.

52:52.656 --> 52:54.424
Maybe you aint.

52:54.491 --> 52:58.896
Until I am one hundred percent sure
that you are who you say you are...

52:58.962 --> 53:01.999
I'm gonna keep my gun trained on
you.

53:02.065 --> 53:05.636
Is that crystal clear?

53:10.908 --> 53:14.912
Now, where's Freddie?

53:16.812 --> 53:19.482
Dead.

53:19.548 --> 53:23.019
What?

53:23.086 --> 53:25.488
He's dead.

53:25.554 --> 53:29.158
How?

53:29.225 --> 53:31.961
I killed him.

53:32.028 --> 53:34.096
Why? Why!?

53:34.163 --> 53:36.699
Hold up there.

53:42.305 --> 53:44.839
Now I've got the gun.

53:44.907 --> 53:46.875
So let's just calm down -

54:10.799 --> 54:14.802
George!

54:17.604 --> 54:19.673
Look at me! Look at me...

54:19.740 --> 54:22.576
Everything's going to be
alright!

54:22.643 --> 54:24.211
Oh god!!

54:24.279 --> 54:27.014
Everything's going to be fine...
everything's going to be just fine

54:27.081 --> 54:31.218
George!!

54:33.020 --> 54:35.956
It's gonna be fine... just
fine...

54:36.023 --> 54:40.160
George? George?

54:47.267 --> 54:51.271
George?

54:56.709 --> 55:00.613
Oh George, you poor fool...

55:05.284 --> 55:10.223
What have you done, Vicky?

55:10.289 --> 55:16.061
I'm sorry... it was just a
mistake

55:16.128 --> 55:17.863
It just went off...

55:17.929 --> 55:22.234
Oh god... why is this happening?

55:22.300 --> 55:24.636
We haven't done anything we just-

55:24.703 --> 55:29.941
Performed a séance. We wanted to
make contact with Ichabod Quinn

55:30.008 --> 55:32.010
and we did.

55:32.077 --> 55:37.882
And now he's back and he wants
to finish his life's work.

55:37.949 --> 55:41.952
We've opened Hell.

55:45.357 --> 55:49.394
George was right.

55:49.461 --> 55:53.564
We shouldn't have meddled with
this.

55:55.866 --> 56:00.171
This is all your fault! You made
us do that bloody séance...

56:00.237 --> 56:02.840
Don't blame me!

56:02.907 --> 56:05.109
All of this was just meant to be
a bit of fun!

56:05.176 --> 56:08.312
You've damned us all you fucking
idiot!!

56:08.379 --> 56:11.848
Try and calm down you're being
hysterical!

56:12.982 --> 56:15.051
That's enough!

56:15.118 --> 56:17.720
There's no use in pointing
fingers now.

56:17.787 --> 56:20.757
We're all in the same boat. If
we want to get out of here alive

56:20.824 --> 56:24.260
we're going to have to start
working together.

56:24.327 --> 56:26.029
What can we do?

56:26.096 --> 56:28.331
Remember what Madame Bellrose
said?

56:28.398 --> 56:32.168
At dawn, the moon will consume
the sun.

56:32.235 --> 56:36.239
We need to end this now, or God
knows what will happen.

56:36.306 --> 56:38.208
But how?

56:38.274 --> 56:43.379
We need to find the gateway to
Hell and close it for good.

56:44.746 --> 56:48.283
The basement. That's where Ichabod
would conduct his ceremonies

56:48.350 --> 56:51.753
to contact the other side, at
the lowest point of the house.

56:51.820 --> 56:56.024
That's where we saw that thing,
Madame Bellrose, heading.

56:59.161 --> 57:03.165
The party's over.

57:39.933 --> 57:41.268
Whiskey?

57:41.334 --> 57:44.838
She doesn't drink, remember?

57:44.905 --> 57:47.207
Chin chin.

57:58.451 --> 58:01.221
Coast is clear.

58:07.494 --> 58:11.230
It's faster if we cut through
here.

58:12.097 --> 58:13.132
Where do we go now?

58:13.199 --> 58:16.435
Through this door, then turn
right.

58:27.446 --> 58:31.049
Much too slow, Christine!

59:04.147 --> 59:05.148
Damn!

59:05.215 --> 59:06.484
Let me see!

59:06.551 --> 59:08.919
No, don't bother. I'm done for!

59:08.986 --> 59:10.487
No, no you're not!

59:10.555 --> 59:14.124
I don't want to turn into one of
them!

59:14.191 --> 59:15.959
Don't let me!

59:16.026 --> 59:17.928
No, no you can't! Please!

59:17.995 --> 59:22.965
It's the only way! Don't worry
about me,

59:23.033 --> 59:26.169
darling sister.

59:29.406 --> 59:33.809
Sorry again for spilling wine on
your dress...

59:41.183 --> 59:45.888
Let's get this over with.

59:50.925 --> 59:56.465
No, I'll do it.

01:00:05.974 --> 01:00:11.246
Some party, hey?

01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:15.317
A real one to remember.

01:00:30.532 --> 01:00:32.966
Come on.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:35.903
We have to go now.

01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:45.346
There's the staircase to the
basement.

01:00:47.147 --> 01:00:50.284
I can't! I can't take it any
more.

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:53.654
First George, and now... and now
poor Victor.

01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:56.989
Look at me! You need to stay
strong, I need your help

01:00:57.056 --> 01:00:59.058
I can't do this on my own!

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.394
I can't... I can't take it.

01:01:01.461 --> 01:01:03.396
Yes you can! And you have to!

01:01:03.463 --> 01:01:06.466
It's the only way! When we end
this,

01:01:06.532 --> 01:01:08.534
maybe they'll all come back, all
of them.

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:10.403
Will they?

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:14.140
I won't stop until I see the
real Freddie again.

01:01:14.207 --> 01:01:16.409
Don't you want to see your
brother again?

01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:17.943
And George...

01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:20.011
But how do you know?

01:01:20.078 --> 01:01:24.883
I don't. But there's only one
way to find out.

01:01:26.385 --> 01:01:29.221
Let's end this, once and for
all.

01:01:29.287 --> 01:01:33.291
You and me.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:40.089
Victor... kills!

01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:36.677
What is it?

01:03:37.678 --> 01:03:40.548
It's George!

01:03:41.415 --> 01:03:43.216
Wait!

01:03:43.283 --> 01:03:47.287
It might not really be him.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:01.034
I have to be sure.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:07.774
Christine!

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:32.364
Christine! Come back!

01:04:32.431 --> 01:04:34.400
Christine!

01:04:54.719 --> 01:04:58.623
George?

01:05:28.018 --> 01:05:32.221
Is it really you?

01:05:34.524 --> 01:05:37.393
Please?

01:06:37.584 --> 01:06:40.487
Bye Vicky.

01:06:47.661 --> 01:06:48.529
Thank you.

01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:50.798
Don't mention it.

01:06:54.368 --> 01:06:57.571
We must be getting closer.

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:21.327
And the dragon sat on the rock
and the rock was the moon

01:07:21.394 --> 01:07:25.665
and the moon consumed the sun and
out of the night came the blackness

01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:29.367
and from the blackness came the
dawn...

01:07:29.434 --> 01:07:30.603
Now what?

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:34.807
Let's kill the bitch.

01:07:36.743 --> 01:07:40.312
...comes fear, and fear spawns
power...

01:07:40.378 --> 01:07:44.050
Clever little girls to get so far,
but I'm afraid it will be of no use.

01:07:44.117 --> 01:07:45.450
The gate is opened!

01:07:45.517 --> 01:07:50.555
And it will remain open until
all Hell is set free.

01:07:50.622 --> 01:07:52.724
Shoot it Elizabeth!

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:55.093
Christine!

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.997
My darling. I'm so glad you came
to me my love.

01:07:59.064 --> 01:08:00.866
I knew you would.

01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:03.567
I'm ready to be together
properly now.

01:08:03.634 --> 01:08:05.703
No more fooling around.

01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:08.539
No more toying with other
lovers.

01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:11.009
Now we can be together for an
eternity.

01:08:11.076 --> 01:08:14.745
We'll never be apart again.

01:08:14.812 --> 01:08:18.549
You're the love of my life,
Christine.

01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:21.719
Don't listen to him, Elizabeth!

01:08:21.786 --> 01:08:23.687
Is it true?

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:33.429
Oh, Elizabeth. Did you really think
I marry someone as small as you?

01:08:33.496 --> 01:08:37.033
How pathetic of you to even say
yes when I asked.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.703
We were only together for a few
mere months.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:44.573
Were you really that desperate?

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.379
I was only with you to make
Christine mad with jealousy.

01:08:50.446 --> 01:08:54.448
And it worked.

01:08:56.719 --> 01:08:58.822
Is it true?

01:08:58.888 --> 01:09:00.089
Elizabeth you have to listen to
me -

01:09:00.156 --> 01:09:05.694
Just answer the question.

01:09:05.761 --> 01:09:08.831
Yes.

01:09:10.465 --> 01:09:13.535
So is that why you were so awful
to me?

01:09:13.602 --> 01:09:15.037
I was a fool to behave the way I
did

01:09:15.103 --> 01:09:18.140
you have to believe me, I was
just in love with the wrong man!

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:21.176
Yes... poor George.

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:25.513
He's down there now, burning for
eternity.

01:09:27.216 --> 01:09:28.716
I'm bored of this now.

01:09:28.783 --> 01:09:29.952
Christine, my love.

01:09:30.018 --> 01:09:32.087
Let's be together forever!

01:09:32.154 --> 01:09:35.622
Elizabeth!! Elizabeth please!!

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:38.826
She's far too feeble to do
anything.

01:09:38.893 --> 01:09:40.761
I'm so sorry Elizabeth!

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:43.798
Elizabeth, please!!

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.918
You fucking bitches!!!

01:10:17.864 --> 01:10:19.866
Help!! No!!

01:10:19.933 --> 01:10:21.600
Christine!!

01:10:21.668 --> 01:10:24.436
Elizabeth!!

01:10:27.007 --> 01:10:27.740
Elizabeth!!

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:31.144
Hold on!!

01:10:44.123 --> 01:10:49.560
No!!

01:13:17.516 --> 01:13:22.516
