00:00.968 --> 00:02.303
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:14.615 --> 00:16.550
* Previously on Gunsmoke... *

00:51.285 --> 00:53.121
(typing)

01:04.165 --> 01:06.634
Oh, I like him.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.102
You do?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.870
Yeah, the new intern.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.872
Jewish kid, right?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.141
Hey, Gary, are you Jewish?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.208
Half-Jewish.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.443
What happened to the other half?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.278
(laughs)

01:17.311 --> 01:20.114
But, seriously, I'm a friend
of the Jewish people.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.550
I swam in the Red Sea, I
touched the cobblestones

01:22.583 --> 01:24.185
where our Lord
and savior knelt.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.187
Have you met my
chief of staff Gareth?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.122
Yes.
I mean, no.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.324
Well, Gary the
Intern, meet Gareth.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.659
Gareth, Gary, Gary, Gareth.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.261
It's a good thing

01:33.294 --> 01:35.263
he's not afraid
of the rumors, huh?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.664
I-- what rumors?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.300
All the interns in my
office dying horribly.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.635
It's all just a
bad coincidence.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.171
I'm sure you'll
break the curse.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
Hey, it's good to
have you on board.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.341
Let's give them hell.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.911
Senator, do you want me to work
up a statement on the war vote?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.346
No.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.148
What do you mean?

01:54.182 --> 01:55.483
About losing the war vote.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.151
We've been getting
calls for a statement.

01:57.185 --> 02:00.388
(chuckles) We didn't lose
the war vote, buddy.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.722
We didn't?
No.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.824
We just need to redefine
"winning."

02:03.857 --> 02:06.494
What happened was winning.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.728
It was?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.197
Ah.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.499
Go to Room SRB-54, all right?

02:11.532 --> 02:12.900
It's downstairs.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.769
That's the room you were
upset about for a while.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.238
I want you to pick up something.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.241
Tell them...
we're ready to release it.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.212
Release what?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.380
It.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.881
And, uh, set up
a press conference

02:27.915 --> 02:29.783
for me for tomorrow.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.420
Senator,

02:32.453 --> 02:33.721
do you still trust me?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.859
Do I...?
Of course I do.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.594
Why?
You just seem
to be making moves

02:40.628 --> 02:42.330
that I don't understand.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.932
Gareth, buddy.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.568
You... you are my tonic.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.271
Y-You are my ballast.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.407
Whenever I go too far,
I look to you

02:53.441 --> 02:54.708
to help straighten me out.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.378
That's trust.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.480
Let's get crackin'.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.782
All right?
The world needs saving.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.298
RED:
You are so cute.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.466
Yes, you are.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.606
(chuckles)
You know you are.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.341
Yeah.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.411
Oh, what a bad girl you are.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.679
Okay.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.749
You want, you want
some flowers?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.451
Here you go.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.320
All right, come on.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.788
Come on, push.
(squishing and popping)

03:40.821 --> 03:42.556
You can do it, baby.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.759
Push, push.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.661
Oh, yes.

04:18.726 --> 04:19.960
For Red Wheatus?

04:25.499 --> 04:28.636
This is a bipartisan budget.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.872
As many around Washington
were pointing fingers,

04:31.905 --> 04:33.707
we pulled up our shirt sleeves.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.443
And this is the result.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.612
We have the agreement
of Majority Leader Amarant

04:38.646 --> 04:42.450
to bring this to a committee
vote in 48 hours.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.617
We can get things done
in Washington.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.586
You're kidding me.
48 hours?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.488
I can't be seen
as an obstructionist.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.624
This was negotiated by one
of yours and one of mine.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.360
Yes, Ella, but they're
in bed together.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.094
What?
No, not literally.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.663
Political bed together.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.964
Don't you see what
they've done?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.566
They've brought together
the extreme left

04:58.599 --> 05:00.534
and the extreme right.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.736
They negotiated this in secret.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
Who knows what the hell's in it?
Oh, you know what's in it.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.074
It's the same thing
that's always in it-- pork.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.510
She gave him military.
He gave her health care.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.979
And we're all gonna
be unhappy and happy

05:12.012 --> 05:14.582
in the same proportion.
God is in the details, Senator.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.484
God is always in the details.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.885
Now, push this vote off.
I can't.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.488
I got friggin'
One Wayers at my door.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.424
Look, if you find something
objectionable in here,

05:23.457 --> 05:24.658
I'll delay the vote.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.860
There's always something
objectionable.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.862
You have 48 hours.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.565
(phone slams)

05:31.599 --> 05:34.602
What do you need?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.737
Everyone.
Now?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.706
Yes, now!
I need everyone now!

05:41.642 --> 05:42.876
You okay?

05:42.910 --> 05:45.446
Yeah, just sick of it.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.581
What?
The gamesmanship.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.050
The stupid moronic tribalism
of congress.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.919
The dirty tricks.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.423
You can't take one step forward
without taking ten steps back.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.124
You're helping people.
No, I'm not!

05:57.157 --> 05:59.927
I'd do better opening
a lemonade stand.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.530
(chuckles, sighs)

06:04.998 --> 06:06.400
It's okay.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.668
Go.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.703
Get everyone.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.507
Listen up!

06:13.541 --> 06:14.975
This is not a budget.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.177
This is a field
of land mines.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.679
Now, we don't know
how many there are.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.548
But we do know they are there.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.683
Or they would have sent out
a searchable PDF.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.884
They're hiding something,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.152
and they don't
want us to find it.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.721
So here's your mission.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.957
You have 48 hours
to cross this field

06:29.990 --> 06:32.125
and find those land mines.

06:32.159 --> 06:36.664
And you're doing it
the old-fashioned way.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.898
This is for team number one.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.800
Page one through 368.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.201
Michael, you take charge of it.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.837
Read every word, sentence,
and paragraph.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.873
You have 48 hours.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.741
This is for team number two.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.678
Page 369 to 712.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.846
Laurel, you take charge of it.
Keep me up to date.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.749
Now, I don't want just
a-a superficial look.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.551
I want a...

07:00.554 --> 07:03.056
(clears throat)
Okay.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.658
You guys split up the rest
of the budget.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.726
And get going.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.562
Go!
(all clamoring)

07:12.165 --> 07:15.168
(indistinct chatter)

07:17.104 --> 07:18.071
You're running an excellent
campaign, gentlemen.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.707
Good convention.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.642
Thank you.
MAN:
That's why we're here.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.677
We need to count our chickens
before they're hatched.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.079
Oh, makes sense.
What chickens?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.616
We're pre-vetting candidates
for the next administration.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.484
You understand
we have to start early,

07:30.518 --> 07:32.252
what with polls being
what they are,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.187
and we don't want
to be presumptuous,

07:34.221 --> 07:36.256
but we have to know

07:36.289 --> 07:38.959
the talent can clear
the advise-and-consent hurdle.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.628
You're asking me
for suggestions?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.663
No, we want you to
consider being vetted.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.798
For?

07:44.832 --> 07:48.001
Director of the CIA.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.807
Y-You want me?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.509
We want to vet you, yeah.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.044
You have been very impressive

07:57.077 --> 07:58.512
on the Select
Intelligence Committee.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.581
Thank you.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.715
KLEIN:
No, thank you.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.717
For your service
to the country.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.787
Now, if you agree, we'll need
to vet you fairly quickly.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.855
Candidate needs viable names

08:07.888 --> 08:09.790
by the end of the week.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.093
(clears throat)

08:13.126 --> 08:15.729
Well, for the good
of the country

08:15.763 --> 08:17.698
and our party,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.232
yes, I agree.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.835
Good.
Then we'll be expediting this.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.937
Please keep it
completely confidential.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.673
The last thing
that the campaign needs

08:25.706 --> 08:28.075
is an accusation
of being presumptuous.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.977
Good.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.112
Thank you, gentlemen.
KLEIN:
Thank you.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.747
Thank you.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.016
(door opens)

08:41.989 --> 08:43.591
(muffled):
Yeah!

08:43.624 --> 08:48.796
(whispering):
They want me to head up the CIA.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.665
They... what?

08:51.699 --> 08:53.967
I know.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.235
Wait, who does?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.838
The campaign.
If they win.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.106
They were with

08:59.139 --> 09:01.008
the transition team.
Oh, my God.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.342
I know.
It's amazing.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.777
Congratulations.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.813
Oh, it's not done yet.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.147
Like, I'm worried
about the vetting process.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.082
I have a lot of enemies
out there.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.684
Yeah, but most of your
enemies would be happy

09:10.718 --> 09:11.719
to get you out of the senate.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.887
That's a good point.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.589
Yeah, but they won't know
what the vetting's for.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.257
No one's supposed to know.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.860
No one's supposed to know
about the CIA offer?
Right.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.729
Yeah, they don't want to be seen
as presumptuous.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.597
But you just told me.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.734
Yeah, but you're my sister.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.768
You can't be telling
me this, Luke,

09:27.801 --> 09:30.337
That's kind of the bare minimum.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.739
Don't tell anyone else, okay?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.608
(both laugh, phone rings)

09:34.642 --> 09:36.076
Hello?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.245
Hi. Are you all right?
You sound...

09:38.278 --> 09:39.713
GARETH:
Yeah.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.881
What are you doing right now?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.315
Nothing.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.351
Can I meet you?
Sure, where?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.186
(door opens)

09:46.219 --> 09:48.789
Yeah, this is good,
but, uh, shorter words.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.790
I'll call you back.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.858
You make me sound

09:50.891 --> 09:53.060
like a Harvard grad.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.294
Was that your girlfriend?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.763
On the phone?
No.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.264
I-I mean, she's
not my girlfriend.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.833
(inhales)
Go ahead.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.371
Gareth, how are you today?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.740
You're looking ill.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.677
No, I'm good.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.818
You're a little warm.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.853
You sure?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.256
It's the summer heat, Senator.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.259
Ah, right.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.963
Are we still rowing
together, buddy?

10:31.198 --> 10:34.935
I think we are, Senator.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.003
Really?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.144
Good!
Again,

10:44.177 --> 10:45.412
good speech,
(clears throat)

10:45.445 --> 10:46.847
but I want punchy words.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.982
You and I know what
"transactional" is,

10:49.016 --> 10:50.718
but nobody else does.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.985
Okay?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.887
Let's get on it.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.090
(door closes)

10:57.124 --> 10:59.159
(Gareth sighs)

11:00.160 --> 11:02.262
*

11:13.941 --> 11:15.743
LAUREL:
Hi.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.977
Hi.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.445
I'm glad you called.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.113
Can I ask you a question?

11:20.147 --> 11:22.883
(exhaling):
You can ask me
anything you want.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.051
No, I'm sorry. Y-You first.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.019
No, no. You go.
Mine's...

11:26.053 --> 11:27.888
too weird.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.257
Okay.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.892
What's your boss doing
with this budget?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.427
I don't know.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.896
What do you mean?
Should I be aware

11:35.929 --> 11:36.964
of something hidden in it?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.900
I don't know.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.934
Maybe.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.837
I don't know. I...

11:43.871 --> 11:44.938
(sighs)

11:44.972 --> 11:46.206
(scoffs)

11:46.239 --> 11:48.041
Okay.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.442
Your turn. What is it?

11:49.476 --> 11:51.144
(chuckles wryly)

11:51.178 --> 11:52.445
I, uh...

11:54.982 --> 11:56.483
This bug stuff.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.484
Tell me more about it.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.718
Why?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.024
Because I saw something.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.096
*

12:21.541 --> 12:23.176
I didn't see this.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.913
You told me there were bugs
in people's heads.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.514
Yeah, but not these bugs.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.082
Are...

12:29.116 --> 12:30.350
are you sure you saw this?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.785
I don't know.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.086
I'm not sure what...

12:35.989 --> 12:38.291
(quietly):
I'm not sure what I saw anymore.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.492
And how big was it?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.395
Seriously?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.797
Yeah.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.800
And that went in Red's head?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.802
Yeah.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.103
This is insane.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.905
(insect buzzing)
I don't like things

12:51.939 --> 12:53.440
that are this insane.
(buzzing stops)

12:53.473 --> 12:54.975
Yeah, I know,
you'll get used to it.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.810
I just thought
this was some kind of

12:56.844 --> 12:58.445
charming bohemian affectation
of yours, you know?

12:58.478 --> 12:59.913
You seeing bugs.

12:59.947 --> 13:00.981
I didn't want it to be

13:01.014 --> 13:02.883
a charming affectation of...
mine.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.486
This is much bigger
than any of the bugs

13:06.519 --> 13:07.888
I've seen.
You know, it was smaller

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
once it dropped its eggs.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.892
Its eggs?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.994
Yeah.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.228
That's what it looked like.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.864
Let's go.
Why?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.365
We have to show
this to someone.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.900
What is this about again?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.501
Uh, security clearance,

13:21.534 --> 13:22.870
just for his work on
the Intelligence Committee.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.471
KLEIN:
Uh, was Senator Healy
a tough boss?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.006
Luke?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.307
Not really.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.476
I mean, he never hit me

13:29.509 --> 13:31.044
or called me names.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.914
What about his managerial style?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.548
Was he responsive to his staff?

13:35.582 --> 13:36.850
Oh, yeah.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.085
He's responsive.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.887
Luke really listens.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.021
When I used
our safe word--

13:41.054 --> 13:42.055
and believe me, there were

13:42.089 --> 13:43.423
plenty of times I had to--

13:43.456 --> 13:45.092
I only had
to say it once.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.927
GERMAINE:
Oh.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.529
I thought you were gonna ask
about all the affairs.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.865
What affairs?

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
Well, just so you know,

13:53.934 --> 13:55.936
I've come to accept Luke
for who he is.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.006
Yes, there were
the years of lying,

13:59.039 --> 14:00.573
but I just wish...

14:00.607 --> 14:02.042
(crying)

14:02.075 --> 14:03.176
Would you excuse me?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.048
Affairs.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.449
That's gonna make
a hearing a nightmare.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.884
I know.

14:10.918 --> 14:11.985
Let's talk to Healy again.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.286
We need to hear his side.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.489
GUSTAV:
It's the queen, isn't it?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.925
WU:
I don't know.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.526
Where did you see it?

14:19.559 --> 14:23.363
Okay, let me just
say something here:

14:23.396 --> 14:26.466
I'm not completely sure
that I saw what I saw.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.901
GUSTAV:
Come on.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.036
You told us that you saw it.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.470
It's the queen bug, isn't it?

14:30.503 --> 14:33.040
I don't know, but this part

14:33.073 --> 14:34.274
looks like the egg sac.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.943
That's where the eggs came out?

14:37.978 --> 14:40.080
GUSTAV:
It's the queen.
We found the queen.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.548
And why is that a good thing?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.350
Well, if it's like
other hives...
Kill the queen,

14:43.383 --> 14:44.551
you kill the hive.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.186
WU:
That's a bit simplistic,
but yes.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.155
If it's anything like a beehive,

14:48.188 --> 14:50.357
the workers all die
if the queen dies.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.658
ROCHELLE:
That's one way
to attack it, then.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.394
We just need
to kill one bug.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.029
Not thousands.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.664
Yes.
If it acts like hive.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.066
Do we know where
this queen is now?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.468
I think I'd better go.
No. Wait. Why?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.303
Because you're going
to want to know how to get

15:03.336 --> 15:04.972
a large bug out of my boss'
head, and I don't think

15:05.005 --> 15:06.239
I have the patience
for that conversation.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.942
It's in Senator Wheatus' head?

15:08.976 --> 15:09.476
We should kill him.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.011
LAUREL: What? No.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.079
ROCHELLE:
We can't kill a senator,

15:12.112 --> 15:13.480
Gustav,
that's ridiculous.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.948
GUSTAV:
I'm just saying
that if it saves

15:14.982 --> 15:16.283
the human race, is it wrong?

15:16.316 --> 15:18.551
Yes, it's wrong.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.020
Human race?

15:22.990 --> 15:25.292
When did we start talking
about "human race"?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.426
You didn't tell him
everything.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.128
No, I-I don't think

15:28.161 --> 15:30.263
it's really a good
idea to get into...

15:30.297 --> 15:33.033
What?

15:33.066 --> 15:35.002
What is "everything"?

15:35.035 --> 15:37.237
They're not of this world.
Gustav.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.472
I'm going.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.308
It was good talking.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.510
(Laurel exhales)

15:43.543 --> 15:46.113
We're not sure about that part.
It's-it's just a theory.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.348
It's just a theory that the
bugs come from another planet?

15:48.381 --> 15:49.616
You don't have
to believe that

15:49.649 --> 15:51.151
to know that something
weird is going on.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.020
There's always
something weird going on.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.454
This is insane.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.089
I'm not disagreeing.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.358
Okay.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.627
I just... I have
to get back to work.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.196
Well, call me, okay?

16:03.230 --> 16:06.199
Or am I... too insane?

16:12.272 --> 16:13.540
I'll call.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.378
*

16:26.219 --> 16:28.588
Hey, Mom, how are you guys?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.058
Oh, honey!
Hey, it's Gareth.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.459
It's the middle of the day.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.094
NORA: What's wrong, honey?
Nothing.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.262
I just wanted
to hear how you guys were.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.429
Oh, we're good.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.631
Your father's home
between shifts.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.602
He's just fixing the toaster
for the 15th time

16:42.635 --> 16:44.471
instead of just
buying a new one.
It's perfectly good.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.473
I'm happy to hear
nothing's changed.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.308
Honey, you sound funny.
What is it?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.443
Are things crazy there?
No, I'm good. How's Kathy?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.145
Oh, she's good.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.546
We're trying a new medication.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.483
So far, so good,
so she's happy.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.651
You know who dropped by?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.787
Don't tell him about that.
Why not?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.055
Because he'll be
poisoned against her,

17:02.089 --> 17:03.490
because you brought her up.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.724
Wait, what's Dad saying?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.825
NORA:
Nothing.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.095
He wanted me
not to mention

17:08.128 --> 17:09.696
that Mary Anne dropped by
to see how you were doing.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.697
Oh, my God.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.199
She's pre-med now.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.200
Okay, I'm hanging up.
Wait, why?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.735
She... she just wanted
to see how you were doing.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.237
I love you, Mom. Good-bye.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.239
See? I told you.
Your dad's saying

17:19.272 --> 17:21.208
"I told you."
I love you, Mom.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.642
I just have to go.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.744
Give Mary Anne a call, okay?

17:24.777 --> 17:27.180
She still wonders
why you broke up.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.515
Okay. I will.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.283
Bye. Gotta go.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.193
Hello.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.761
Fiber. They don't count fiber.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.196
Excuse me?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.831
These energy bars
in your drawer?

17:44.864 --> 17:46.266
You'd be better off
eating two Hostess cupcakes.

17:46.299 --> 17:50.270
Fiber increases
the calorie intake by 20%.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.405
And this, here:
"Made with natural ingredients."

17:52.439 --> 17:55.208
Everything is natural.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.177
It could have human hair in it;
it would still be natural.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.678
You need to look for "organic."

17:58.711 --> 18:00.280
There's a legal definition
for "organic."

18:01.714 --> 18:03.250
Why were you in my desk?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.352
I was bored.
I couldn't find the budget.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.293
Ah. I should've looked
in the credenza, there.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.663
Or you could've waited
in reception for me to return.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.166
Who are you?
Cole Stockwell.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.600
Sorry, I don't shake hands;
it's not personal.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.235
And why are you here?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.303
The senator told me
to help you.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.837
I used to write budgets.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.373
I used to translate
human language into this.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.641
He hired me
to do the reverse:

18:28.675 --> 18:30.210
translate this back
into human language.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.278
Ah.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.680
Great.
Can I see the collar here?

18:33.713 --> 18:34.647
Why?

18:34.681 --> 18:35.782
It's just something I do.

18:35.815 --> 18:36.583
Okay.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.553
(chuckles)

18:40.587 --> 18:41.488
Sorry.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.490
Just... "40% cotton."

18:43.523 --> 18:44.724
That always makes me laugh.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.193
(laughing)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
(phone ringing)
Do you mind?

18:48.261 --> 18:49.362
No, no. Don't mind me.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.331
I'll just... Ha.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.566
Laurel Healy.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.834
Miss Healy,
this is Senator Red Wheatus.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.169
Do you recognize my voice?

18:56.203 --> 18:57.870
I do.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.872
Would you like to speak
to my brother, Senator?

18:59.906 --> 19:02.642
Mm, no, no,
I want to speak to you.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.411
I have something
I need to show you.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.778
You do?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.247
And what is that?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.249
Well, I could tell you,

19:09.282 --> 19:10.450
but that would hurt
the surprise.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.252
"Spending for
means-tested entitlements

19:12.285 --> 19:13.653
"other than Medicaid

19:13.686 --> 19:16.556
enacted at 1.3% GDP."
Love it.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.191
I'm a little busy,
Senator.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.292
Come to my office.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.927
This'll only take 20 minutes.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.230
No, let's... do it
someplace public.

19:23.263 --> 19:27.500
Lana, I have some oppo research
here to present to you.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.802
You're not gonna want
to be in public for this.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.638
I'll call you back.
Lana, no, you can't just...

19:33.506 --> 19:35.642
It's beautiful.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.843
Oh, my God.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.811
I spend my life writing laws

19:38.845 --> 19:41.348
in a way nobody can
figure out what they mean.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.815
I know every trick
in the book.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.984
I invented some of them,
but this...

19:45.017 --> 19:45.985
this is like

19:46.018 --> 19:47.754
the Picasso of legislation.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.290
I just have
to tip my hat and cry.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.658
Hey, it's me.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.326
Red Wheatus just called me.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.427
He did? Why?

19:54.461 --> 19:55.662
He wants to meet.
Who is it?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.929
With-with who? You?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.698
Yes.
Red Wheatus just called Laurel.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.333
He wants to meet.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.302
Yes, definitely.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.603
This is an opportunity.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.705
We need to find a way
to draw the queen out.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.274
WU:
From my hymenoptera books--

20:07.307 --> 20:10.377
all with queens.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.712
Will you be safe
if you meet with him?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.314
I don't know, I guess.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.348
Okay, then we think
you should do it.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.449
But be careful.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.884
I will.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.286
I'll call you.
You know
the weird thing?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.553
This budget is going
out of its way

20:20.587 --> 20:22.322
to offer something for everyone?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.291
Then why are they hiding it all
in gobbledygook?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.393
Why do they hide Waldo?
Because it's fun to find him.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.961
It's talking to me.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.698
This budget...

20:31.731 --> 20:33.533
it wants me to find Waldo.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.967
They said that?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.337
In so many words.
And a few gestures.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.272
So it's all about sex.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.873
I thought we were past that.
We're never past that.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.575
POHL:
Senator, you have
a lot going for you.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.644
We cannot have a Petraeus
problem on our hands.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.479
So? What do we do about it?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.481
Well, for starters,

20:48.515 --> 20:50.317
you provide us
with a complete list

20:50.350 --> 20:51.918
of all the women
you've had relations with

20:51.951 --> 20:53.353
and then we go from there.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.724
Hmm.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.327
You know,
I just became a father.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.329
And... when I looked into

21:02.362 --> 21:04.431
my daughter's face
for the first time,

21:04.464 --> 21:07.834
I thought, "My God,
all the clichés are true."

21:07.867 --> 21:11.471
I knew, right then,
I had to be a better man.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.972
I made a commitment.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.375
I went to all the women
you're asking about

21:15.408 --> 21:16.609
and I told them it was over.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.478
And I meant it.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.313
I haven't spoken
to any of them since

21:20.347 --> 21:21.348
and I don't even think about it.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.982
But even if I hadn't,

21:23.015 --> 21:24.784
are you really suggesting
I can't do my job

21:24.817 --> 21:27.320
because I'm a failed
human being?

21:27.354 --> 21:30.557
Does your candidate really want
to be suggesting that?

21:39.499 --> 21:41.968
(creaking)

21:52.645 --> 21:55.047
(faint buzzing)

22:07.159 --> 22:09.462
(buzzing continues)

22:15.402 --> 22:17.404
(phone rings)

22:22.475 --> 22:25.445
(phone rings)

22:25.478 --> 22:26.446
Hello.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.947
Hey, it's me.

22:27.980 --> 22:28.981
Is it too late?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.583
I...

22:30.617 --> 22:32.151
(chuckles)
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.620
I'm here. What's up?

22:33.653 --> 22:36.155
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.156
Are you?

22:37.189 --> 22:40.092
I am. I'm just, um...

22:42.429 --> 22:44.564
(sighs)

22:44.597 --> 22:45.932
What are you doing?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.609
You don't have to do this.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.978
Shut up.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.013
It's not just an excuse
to have you come over...

23:01.047 --> 23:02.549
Gareth.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.650
I don't even know
if I believe this.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.684
I know.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.153
We can have sex if you want.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.622
No. Shh, it's okay.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.495
What is happening
in the world?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.997
Same thing as usual.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.433
Disruption.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.101
People don't like normal.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.537
I like normal.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.906
That's why I like you.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.479
You'll keep the bugs away?

23:32.512 --> 23:34.146
Yes.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.625
We're wrapping up our vetting of
Senator Healy, and moving on to

23:45.658 --> 23:47.059
a closer look into his family.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.461
I understand you
had some interaction

23:48.495 --> 23:50.630
with Senator Healy's sister,
Laurel.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.231
Laurel Healy was brought in

23:52.264 --> 23:53.733
for over 12 hours
of intensive questioning

23:53.766 --> 23:55.935
under an Appendix Q scenario,

23:55.968 --> 23:57.570
regarding her possible
connection

23:57.604 --> 23:59.506
to a terrorist group in Syria.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.940
Still an open file, actually.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.542
Her involvement?

24:02.575 --> 24:04.511
She had
some pretty radical ideas

24:04.544 --> 24:06.546
to explain
the catastrophic head injuries.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.147
How radical?

24:08.180 --> 24:10.650
STOCKWELL:
"An expected default

24:10.683 --> 24:13.786
"by the Postal Service
on required contributions

24:13.820 --> 24:16.889
to the Postal Service retiree
health benefits fund..."

24:16.923 --> 24:18.825
Can you stop talking?

24:18.858 --> 24:21.027
It's kind of
making my head explode.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.695
STOCKWELL:
It just means...

24:22.729 --> 24:24.531
One second, Stockwell.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.066
How are you doing?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.235
Fine.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.671
Metadata.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.639
I'm sorry, what?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.240
Metadata.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.208
I went through the Word
document on Red's laptop.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.510
The budget.

24:37.544 --> 24:38.545
It shows all
the corrections

24:38.578 --> 24:39.846
that he made
in the budget.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.214
And?
There were no alterations

24:42.248 --> 24:43.516
or corrections
anywhere else,

24:43.550 --> 24:44.817
except for one area.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.653
There were two
dozen corrections

24:46.686 --> 24:48.588
in one section
of the budget.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.690
Which section?

24:50.723 --> 24:51.924
The farm bill.

24:52.925 --> 24:53.993
The farm bill?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.562
Yeah.
Everything Red cares about

24:55.595 --> 24:56.696
is in the farm bill.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.631
All the corrections
were there.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.233
I have to go.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.703
Thank you.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.274
Look in the farm bill section.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.076
Why? What's in it?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.878
I don't know, but look.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.915
Ms. Healy?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.316
Hello, I'm wondering
if you have

25:17.349 --> 25:19.151
a minute to talk
about your brother?

25:19.185 --> 25:21.621
As part of
the vetting process,

25:21.654 --> 25:23.322
we have to dive deep
into family history,

25:23.355 --> 25:26.158
checking into any
potential liabilities.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.794
Okay, great.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.662
What do you think
about bugs?

25:32.031 --> 25:32.999
Excuse me?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.667
Bugs.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.802
What do you
think of 'em?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.937
H-Have you been, uh,

25:37.970 --> 25:39.739
noticing a larger
amount of them

25:39.772 --> 25:40.773
than usual in D.C.?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.275
I don't understand.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.645
We talked to
an FBI agent...

25:45.678 --> 25:46.846
Anthony Onofrio?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.682
Why do you say that name?

25:49.716 --> 25:50.617
I broke up with him

25:50.650 --> 25:52.018
and he didn't handle it well.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.655
So he abused his position and

25:55.688 --> 25:57.089
interrogated me
at an FBI black site.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.325
Is that true?

25:59.358 --> 26:01.127
It is.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.197
So, you-you never said
anything, uh, like...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.266
"Bugs are eating half
the brains of senators

26:07.299 --> 26:09.836
and turning them
into zombies"?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.777
(laughs)

26:17.810 --> 26:19.946
(chuckles)

26:19.979 --> 26:21.147
(laughs)

26:21.180 --> 26:22.381
Seriously?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.315
I know.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.652
(whoops, laughs)

26:25.685 --> 26:26.919
Bugs?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.254
(laughs)
Ha.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.656
(all laughing)

26:29.689 --> 26:30.923
Okay, monkey brains.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.258
That's how we get the bugs

26:32.291 --> 26:34.994
out of Red's head.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.929
Bad time?

26:38.030 --> 26:39.098
GUSTAV:
Sorry, I didn't

26:39.131 --> 26:40.232
know that you were
in a meeting.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.233
What is this?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.069
Monkey brains.
Excuse me?

26:43.102 --> 26:44.804
Brains from a monkey.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.806
I got 'em down in Chinatown.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.675
Take them into
the Red meeting.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.242
It's the carrot to
draw out the queen bug.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.644
Oh, God, they smell.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.979
I know.
(inhales sharply)

26:53.012 --> 26:54.180
I tried to hide it with cologne.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.682
Are you serious?
If we're not gonna

26:55.715 --> 26:57.784
kill Red, we need
to draw out the queen bug.

26:57.817 --> 26:58.484
You know, let's just

26:58.517 --> 27:00.687
put it in here.
Oh, my God.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.922
I actually think you
secretly like this.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.991
No, actually, no.
This is my face

27:05.024 --> 27:06.625
when I don't like something.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.763
Hey, what happened
at your interview with Pohl?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.198
What do you mean?

27:12.231 --> 27:13.966
I got a call
that it didn't go well.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.706
I think I'm out of contention.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.940
It was about the affairs,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.209
right?
No, I don't think so.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.911
You don't?
What do you mean?

27:24.944 --> 27:29.081
They had everything from
the black site interrogation.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.718
I think they think I'm... crazy.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.721
Oh, my God,
this about the bugs?

27:34.754 --> 27:35.688
Let me handle it.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.389
Laurel, you can't cost me this.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.792
I'll handle it.
Just let me handle it.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.030
(Melanesian choir music playing)

27:44.063 --> 27:46.065
(knocking)
Come on in.

27:46.098 --> 27:50.069
(Melanesian choir music
continues)

27:53.105 --> 27:55.875
Yeah, you like it?

27:55.908 --> 27:58.310
I just found it on iTunes.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.913
Melanesian choir.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.782
"Jisas, Masta Mi Save."

28:02.815 --> 28:04.817
Yeah, I think so.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.453
Top 20.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.056
(humming along)

28:16.428 --> 28:18.965
What do you need, Senator?

28:18.998 --> 28:20.767
Well...
(music stops)

28:20.800 --> 28:23.169
it might be what you need.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.039
You've slept with 24
different guys, haven't you?

28:27.073 --> 28:28.507
Ah, oppo research.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.476
And one of those guys

28:30.509 --> 28:32.078
ended up murdering his mom

28:32.111 --> 28:33.479
for her Social Security money.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.914
Really? Which one?

28:34.947 --> 28:36.182
Uh...

28:36.215 --> 28:37.349
Pavlov Whinship.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.318
Seriously?

28:39.351 --> 28:40.419
Oh, my God, I liked him.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.921
(chuckles):
Yeah.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.857
Well, there are
other unsavory aspects

28:44.891 --> 28:45.892
to your history here.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.026
Fistfight with a cab driver?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.094
(chuckling):
Yeah.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.862
So here's the key, Laurel.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.030
Hey, you got my name right.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.198
I've got a stick.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.365
And I've got a carrot.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.201
You've heard the stick.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.869
Oppo research.

28:56.903 --> 28:57.904
But...

28:58.971 --> 29:00.239
What's that smell?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.874
I don't know.
Do you smell something?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.810
I do.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.311
The carrot?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.179
R-Right. Right, right.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.815
Well,
(music resumes)

29:08.848 --> 29:11.317
I like this music.
I've been

29:11.350 --> 29:13.119
listening to it all afternoon.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.154
I wouldn't mind seeing
a documentary about it.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.889
I wonder if you know

29:16.923 --> 29:18.024
of someone

29:18.057 --> 29:19.358
who might be
interested.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.962
My caucus has a $2 million fund

29:22.995 --> 29:25.497
to invest in such a documentary.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.799
You wouldn't do that.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.801
Why wouldn't I?

29:28.835 --> 29:31.170
Because you don't care
about the Solomon Islands.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.371
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.473
I love this part.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.910
(singing along)

29:42.849 --> 29:43.916
(music stops)

29:43.950 --> 29:46.318
Here's what I do care about:

29:48.020 --> 29:49.455
Getting rid of you.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.891
You'd pay me $2 million
to get rid of me?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.225
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.797
Well, look at this.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.935
What kind of brains are those?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.203
Monkey.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.873
What's in the farm bill?

30:09.041 --> 30:11.010
I'm a little busy right now.

30:11.043 --> 30:14.180
Why don't you take your
Tupperware of monkey brains

30:14.213 --> 30:18.217
and, uh, think about whether
you want to make documentaries.

30:18.250 --> 30:22.521
And, yes, that's the first time
I've used that sentence.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.223
$2 million?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.224
Yep.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.927
You can make a pretty good
documentary with that.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.929
Think about it.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.364
On second thought,

30:32.398 --> 30:34.400
I'm gonna keep this.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.617
Thank you for coming back,
Mr. Pohl.

30:51.650 --> 30:54.987
I just wanted to clarify
our previous misunderstanding.

30:55.021 --> 30:55.988
Are you familiar with

30:56.022 --> 30:57.623
the auteur theory?

30:57.656 --> 30:58.657
See, I'm a filmmaker,

30:58.690 --> 30:59.992
and as a filmmaker,

31:00.026 --> 31:02.628
I use the language of metaphor.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.931
This...

31:04.964 --> 31:06.933
is my most recent work.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.434
Not with tanks,

31:08.467 --> 31:11.470
but with an infection.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.471
(shouting indistinctly)

31:12.504 --> 31:14.506
An infection of extremism.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.279
See, here I use "infection"
to represent revolution.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.149
And you made that documentary?

31:23.182 --> 31:24.583
I did.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.219
So, all the bug stuff you heard

31:27.253 --> 31:29.021
was just my way of talking about

31:29.055 --> 31:30.489
extremism in Washington.

31:30.522 --> 31:34.626
As an artist,
I use metaphors a lot.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.063
Probably too much.
I... (chuckles)

31:37.096 --> 31:38.197
I love metaphors.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.101
(laughing):
Come on, Ms. Healy.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.569
Bugs as
metaphor?

31:43.602 --> 31:44.603
Well, there's
a long history.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.705
I mean, Kafka's cockroach.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.241
Nabokov's butterflies.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.077
Carlo Collodi's Jiminy Cricket.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.712
I always loved him.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.016
Me, too.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.185
John, this budget bill
is a train wreck.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.053
We can't let them derail us
with it.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.054
Tell me I have your vote.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.189
RECEPTIONIST:
Senator,

32:03.222 --> 32:05.958
it's Agent Roarty
from the CIA.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.194
John? John,
I'll have to call you back.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.364
(exhales deeply)

32:12.398 --> 32:14.633
Agent Roarty,
what can I do for you?

32:16.402 --> 32:17.669
Yes.

32:17.703 --> 32:18.737
I-I'd be happy to come in

32:18.770 --> 32:21.040
for a briefing
with the director.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.575
Understood.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.544
All security measures
will be taken

32:25.577 --> 32:27.746
and are acceptable.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.248
I will see you then.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.520
(grunts)

32:34.553 --> 32:37.990
I have now successfully
translated the farm bill section

32:38.024 --> 32:39.758
into layman's legalese.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.295
No easy feat, let me tell you.
These guys are masters.

32:43.329 --> 32:46.298
And? What does it do?
It provides

32:46.332 --> 32:49.635
the usual subsidies to various
well-connected agribusinesses.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.572
Plus, one little oddity
even I can't explain.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.474
Which is?
$300 million

32:55.507 --> 32:57.009
for a construction project,

32:57.043 --> 32:59.778
located in 80 small towns
across the country.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.048
They're not known
for growing anything.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.083
What are the towns?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.753
"Dove Creek, Hotchkiss,

33:07.786 --> 33:10.056
"Lemon Cove,
Peetz Hill,

33:10.089 --> 33:12.224
and Ribera."

33:12.258 --> 33:13.225
What?

33:13.259 --> 33:15.594
They sound familiar. Why...?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.735
Do you want me to wait here?
Hello?

33:28.374 --> 33:31.110
These are
the same towns.
Okay.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.811
And these are
blueprints for...

33:32.844 --> 33:34.113
Internment camps.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.815
Internment camps for whom?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.317
I don't know.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.319
But why bury the budget
for internment camps

33:40.352 --> 33:42.621
in a farming bill?

33:48.127 --> 33:50.096
(air conditioner humming)

33:56.135 --> 33:58.570
(air conditioner stops)

34:14.653 --> 34:16.188
It's the heat.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.090
I'm sorry, what?

34:18.124 --> 34:20.459
The air-conditioning in the
Russell Building is on a timer.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.762
It shuts off
at exactly 10:30 p.m.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.099
Bugs need a temperature between
85 and 95 degrees to spawn.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.101
How do you know that?

34:29.135 --> 34:31.870
It's true. I don't know
why it's important,

34:31.903 --> 34:33.672
but it's true.

34:33.705 --> 34:34.306
Hmm.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.179
(sighs) All I've done for the
last 24 hours is Google bugs.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.548
They need 85 degrees to spawn,
and the Russell Building

34:42.581 --> 34:45.217
only hits that temperature
after the A/C shuts down.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.686
When did you see the queen
bug spawn the last time?

34:47.719 --> 34:48.754
11:00 p.m.

34:48.787 --> 34:52.258
So the queen will
come out again.
After 10:30.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.827
(exhales)

34:57.429 --> 34:58.864
It's official.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.098
I'm insane.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.774
RED: Since when has idealism
become a dirty word, Senator?

35:08.807 --> 35:11.710
I'm an idealist and proud of...
(crackling)

35:11.743 --> 35:13.879
(grunts, moans)

35:13.912 --> 35:15.714
One second, baby.

35:15.747 --> 35:19.318
One second. Patience.
Patience.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.220
Uh-huh.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.890
Then join us.

35:24.923 --> 35:28.927
What you call moderation
I call not giving a crap.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.297
All right. All right.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.564
All right, bye. Bye.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.401
Uh, I'm getting them.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.235
(chuckling):
I'm getting...

35:36.268 --> 35:40.172
(soft grunting)

35:40.206 --> 35:42.374
Where are the cherry blossoms?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.609
The flowers there?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.177
Yeah. The flowers there.
Where are they?

35:45.211 --> 35:46.712
They were dying, Senator.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.347
I threw them out.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.815
Cherry blossom season
is almost over...

35:49.848 --> 35:51.550
I don't want a dissertation,
I want cherry bl...

35:51.583 --> 35:52.951
(chuckles)
Not yet.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.620
No... not yet.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.222
You might try the other room?

36:03.762 --> 36:06.365
Good enough.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.370
Oh, good. You found them.
I-I wasn't sure...

36:14.440 --> 36:15.441
(grunting)

36:15.474 --> 36:17.476
(trilling)

36:20.379 --> 36:22.348
Uh, sorry.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.716
I cut that one a little close,
didn't I?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.485
Senator, good evening.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.354
What...?
What are you doing?

36:28.387 --> 36:30.589
Just came by to talk
about my documentary.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.892
Not now.
I need you out of my office.

36:33.925 --> 36:34.760
Or?

36:34.793 --> 36:37.229
Wh-What?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.931
You said you need me out
of your office. Or...?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.500
Th-There is no "or."

36:41.533 --> 36:43.735
I am a senator,
and you are nothing.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.305
Who were you
talking to before?
It's none of your business.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.873
Let me see.
No, no, no, no.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.875
There's the door.
I need you to leave.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.843
Go on. Don't
treat my office

36:51.877 --> 36:54.012
like some bus station
waiting room.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.347
He's blocking it.
It's out.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.516
Hurry! Hurry, they're coming!
Hurry!

36:57.549 --> 36:59.785
(grunting)

36:59.818 --> 37:01.353
Get off me!

37:01.387 --> 37:03.255
ROCHELLE:
Where is it?
His desk. There!

37:03.289 --> 37:04.456
LAUREL:
It's going for his ear!

37:04.490 --> 37:05.757
Watch-watch it! Watch it!

37:05.791 --> 37:07.459
I got him. Go!

37:07.493 --> 37:09.027
LAUREL:
There it goes!

37:09.060 --> 37:10.629
GUSTAV:
Under the couch!

37:14.500 --> 37:16.535
Okay.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.005
Don't you dare hurt her!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.280
Damn.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.349
There! There!

37:30.382 --> 37:31.683
There!
Oh!

37:31.717 --> 37:33.385
Aah!

37:34.653 --> 37:37.022
(clattering)

37:38.824 --> 37:39.891
Gary!
Shh!

37:44.496 --> 37:46.532
(Red screaming)

37:46.565 --> 37:48.500
Did you need me, Senator?

37:48.534 --> 37:49.868
(screaming)

37:49.901 --> 37:52.371
Senator? Senator?

37:52.404 --> 37:55.006
No! Hey! No!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.975
Hey, hey! Hey!
You get your hands...

37:57.008 --> 37:58.744
(indistinct struggling)

38:00.946 --> 38:02.080
(gasps)

38:02.113 --> 38:03.849
Get out of here now.

38:03.882 --> 38:04.883
You lost.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.552
Get out!

38:06.585 --> 38:09.821
Gary the Intern, get
the Capitol Police on the line.

38:09.855 --> 38:10.689
Yes, Senator.

38:13.459 --> 38:17.463
If you don't want to be
arrested, I'd go right now.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.737
MAN:
Senator Healy.

38:25.771 --> 38:29.441
I'm Bob Isenstadt.
You probably don't know me.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.976
I'm the director's director.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.512
"The director's director"?
Is that an official title?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.647
(chuckling):
No, more like an honorific.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.483
I'm here for continuity.

38:37.516 --> 38:41.753
CIA directors come and go,
but I stay, just like crabgrass.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.022
(both chuckle)
You're the Hoover of the CIA?

38:44.055 --> 38:46.892
(laughing):
We're gonna get along fine.
Why don't you come on back?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.495
Sit on down, Senator.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.796
Congratulations.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.499
You're the top choice
for CIA director.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.468
And now comes
the fun part.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.136
(chuckles)
Is there a fun part?

38:58.169 --> 38:59.671
The security briefing.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.707
Just as the presidential
candidates are given

39:01.740 --> 39:04.976
a classified briefing on
ongoing programs and dilemmas,

39:05.010 --> 39:08.580
the CIA directors
get the same.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.616
So, here we are.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.385
Well, I am ready.

39:13.419 --> 39:16.622
Uh, just a few preliminaries,
if you don't mind.

39:16.655 --> 39:20.626
This will be my 21st briefing
of a CIA director,

39:20.659 --> 39:23.495
but they
never get old.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.398
The presidential
candidates have been told

39:26.432 --> 39:27.733
what I'm about
to tell you.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.402
But no one else.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.870
And you're
to tell no one.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.972
Or discuss
with anyone.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.607
You understand?

39:36.642 --> 39:37.809
Yes.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.645
Good.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.116
Two months ago, a meteor
from the constellation Draco

39:45.150 --> 39:48.086
landed in the Russian province
of Chelyabinsk.

39:48.119 --> 39:53.124
Inside this meteor
were flesh-eating bugs.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.496
Now, we don't have
a name for them yet,

39:57.529 --> 40:00.532
but these bugs appear to enter
through the eardrum of humans,

40:00.566 --> 40:04.436
and consume about 40%
of the cerebral hemisphere.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.805
The corpus callosum.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.942
The resulting victim

40:10.976 --> 40:14.480
undergoes several alterations
of character.

40:14.513 --> 40:18.149
They become angrier,
more directed,

40:18.183 --> 40:20.952
and whatever biases
they had before,

40:20.986 --> 40:22.854
whether political
or cultural,

40:22.888 --> 40:25.857
become more aggravated.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.959
Until recently,
we did not know

40:27.993 --> 40:30.529
the reason
for this parasite,

40:30.562 --> 40:32.931
but now we believe

40:32.964 --> 40:36.535
it is part of an
intelligent outside plan

40:36.568 --> 40:39.505
to keep mankind
struggling with itself.

40:39.538 --> 40:43.542
I know this
sounds incredible.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.545
And as of two weeks ago,
I probably would've laughed

40:46.578 --> 40:48.814
such a story out
of my office, but...

40:48.847 --> 40:50.982
this is real.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.918
Do you understand?

40:55.053 --> 41:00.025
I, uh...
I-I heard something like this.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.561
Yes, we're
aware of that.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.196
We need to ask something
of you, Senator.

41:05.230 --> 41:09.801
We need you and your sister
to stand down.

41:09.835 --> 41:13.204
My sister?
Well, yeah.
She was one of the first

41:13.238 --> 41:16.608
to discover this attack, and
she stumbled across our path,

41:16.642 --> 41:19.110
preventing us from
moving on the ringleaders.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.112
Just last night,
we were attempting

41:21.146 --> 41:22.981
to take Red Wheatus
into custody,

41:23.014 --> 41:25.817
but your sister and her friends
prevented us

41:25.851 --> 41:27.786
from executing our operation.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.657
The CIA respects amateurs,
but we're...

41:31.690 --> 41:33.592
(chuckling):
also wary of them!

41:33.625 --> 41:36.628
They tend to make
our lives difficult.

41:36.662 --> 41:42.300
We have a plan to battle this...

41:42.333 --> 41:44.903
invasion-- yes,
I'll call it that-- but...

41:44.936 --> 41:48.974
we need you and your sister
to stand down.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.009
You understand?

41:54.312 --> 41:57.949
I... Yes, uh...

41:57.983 --> 42:00.719
th-this is so bizarre.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.790
Yes, it is.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.826
But still, it's nothing
like Fallujah.

42:07.859 --> 42:11.663
Well, thank you
for, uh, coming in.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.031
(clears throat quietly)

42:13.064 --> 42:15.066
We'll be in touch.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.137
Yes, uh... thank you. I, uh...

42:22.808 --> 42:25.076
Thank you.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.148
*

42:40.826 --> 42:42.828
What do you think?

42:45.631 --> 42:48.834
I think it worked.
