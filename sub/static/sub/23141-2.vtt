WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.804
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.874
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.309
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.046 --> 00:13.214
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.548
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.683
Only on Fox.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.061
What are we looking at?

00:27.095 --> 00:29.663
Unattended bag. We're debating
how long it has to be there

00:29.697 --> 00:30.864
before it's
considered suspicious.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.366
The only thing suspicious
about that bag

00:32.400 --> 00:33.834
is why someone would buy it.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.003
It's not dangerous.
It's probably just some girl's.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.072
Some tacky girl's.
She's better off without it.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.673
I don't know.
It's not that bad.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.375
You know whose it is?
I bet it's Nichole's.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.177
She doesn't need
a bag that size.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.512
She goes to Vegas just to strip.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.846
All her clothes
fit in her wallet.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.848
Oh, it could be Artem's, though.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.683
He could've won it
off another gambler.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.419
BERNARD: No, he stopped
accepting luggage as payment

00:51.452 --> 00:53.254
ever since that duffle bag
gave him bedbugs.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.055
I think it's beds
that get Artem bugs.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.857
Well, it's got to be somebody.
Probably that Brit.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.592
What's his name, your make out
buddy from the bathroom?

00:58.626 --> 01:00.027
-Colin.
-I bet it's him.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.097
-British men are basically
American women. -BERNARD: No.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.733
That bag is way too expensive
on a professor's salary.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.436
This is dumb. We can't stand
here all day staring at a bag.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.770
I'm gonna call security.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.373
They'll take it away
or explode it or whatever.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.408
Ronnie, don't.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.444
-It's my bag.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.712
I've been looking for it for
20 minutes, and I come back here

01:18.746 --> 01:20.448
and you guys are talking about
how it's ugly and a girl's bag.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.549
-It's both.
-Sorry.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.217
I was waiting for you
to leave to pick it up,

01:23.251 --> 01:24.452
but you know what?
I am not ashamed.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.221
I am a modern man.
I do not subscribe to labels.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.557
I can own whatever bag I want.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.394
I am Captain Dave, and I am
proud to own a pink tote.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.229
Hot saleslady sold it to you,
didn't she?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.265
Ugh, she was so hot, Bernie.
I was trying to impress her.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.766
I haggled her up.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.072
-Mm-hmm.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.608
Ronnie is winner!

01:47.641 --> 01:49.277
Drinks are on me tonight!

01:49.310 --> 01:50.811
-All right!

01:50.844 --> 01:51.979
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.914
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.917
*

02:09.497 --> 02:12.166
Don't you worry. She's here.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.001
-Ronnie.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.270
That's the one you're
desperately looking for, yes?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.005
Nope. I was just sitting here

02:18.038 --> 02:20.841
studying up for my weekend
fatherhood duties.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.943
It's like a 48-hour test
every week,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.679
and I won't know how I did
for 20 years.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.515
Don't lie to me.
I'm a professional gambler.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.982
I read people.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.618
I'm just trying to read my book.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.320
A book. Hey.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.124
You know what book I like?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.126
That one about
the girl who's gone

02:39.159 --> 02:41.462
and Ben Affleck
had to look for her.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.297
Did you ever watch that book?

02:43.331 --> 02:46.634
"No" feels like the quickest way
to end this conversation.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.869
Hi, Ronnie.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.707
See? Desperately,
your head was like...

02:53.741 --> 02:57.211
What just fell out of your hair?
Are those muffin crumbs?

02:57.245 --> 03:01.048
"No" feels like the quickest way
to end this conversation.

03:04.518 --> 03:08.222
Oh, God, I would love
for today to just be easy.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.325
I'd settle for one flight
without any fighting, vomiting,

03:11.359 --> 03:13.026
or fake emotional
support animals.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.229
Hey, Darryl isn't just
some duck in a vest.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.697
He's helped a lot of people.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.999
No, I know. He has. I'm sorry.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.336
I'm just, I'm in a weird mood.
I had a date last night.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.737
And it didn't go well?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.739
I wouldn't know.
I didn't actually show up.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.174
I bailed ten minutes before,

03:27.207 --> 03:29.243
then hid my phone
in a box of Kashi GOLEAN

03:29.277 --> 03:30.411
in case he texted back.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.679
Really? Kashi GO...

03:31.712 --> 03:33.381
Okay, it was
an empty box of wine.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.716
Can we just focus
on my almost dating, please?

03:35.749 --> 03:37.685
I'm sure you had
a good reason for not going.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.288
Yes. And that reason is
I'm a terrible person.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.923
Hello, friends and colleagues.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.925
Guess who has
two thumbs, nine toes,

03:44.958 --> 03:47.761
and just nailed an interview
with Aviator Magazine.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.597
That's right, this guy.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.700
Favorite part of flying?
Easy, the rush.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.269
If I had one wish?
More wishes.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.906
Personal hero? Latinos.
They've been through so mucho.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.908
Yup. It appears
old Captain Dave Pratman here

04:00.941 --> 04:03.611
has been named
one of Aviator Magazine's

04:03.644 --> 04:06.580
top ten pilots to watch.
So keep your eyes open, kids.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.549
But don't stare for too long,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.751
because this superstar
burns bright.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.888
Well, it sounds like
the straight white guy's

04:14.922 --> 04:18.792
doing great, so at least there's
some justice in the world.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.605
This seat's open.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.909
Oh, these?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.912
They're just coupons for the
club I dance at, Grapefruits.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.781
Free fruit salad
with every lap dance.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.983
-Oh...

04:43.016 --> 04:45.252
I didn't realize you were sick.
Um, that's fine.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.821
You can still come to the club.
Just ask for Danielle.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.923
She can take it.
She beat super gonorrhea.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.792
Is there a coupon
to make you stop talking?

04:54.362 --> 04:55.663
Ah, long time no see.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.264
Hey. Hi.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.468
Ah, before I forget,
I have something for you.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.302
It's the key lime pie
from Foundry.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.271
Well, since you never
showed up to try it,

05:04.304 --> 05:05.806
I thought you might
like a piece.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.975
You are
the spurned rendezvous.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
Oh, that's good. People know.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.812
I was worried it wouldn't be
embarrassing enough.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.682
-There's nothing in here.
-Yeah, that's right.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.850
The key lime pie actually
texted at the last minute

05:16.884 --> 05:19.186
-to say it couldn't make it.
-I'm sorry.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.021
I know that I should've
texted you earlier...

05:21.054 --> 05:23.323
It wasn't just the timing,
it was the content.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.626
All you said was,
"I just can't."

05:25.659 --> 05:28.996
That's not an explanation.
That's a clue on Dateline.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.464
"Her last text was,
'I just can't.'

05:30.498 --> 05:34.034
Then they found her hand buried
in a Dumpster in Jacksonville."

05:34.067 --> 05:37.304
Isn't all of Jacksonville
a Dumpster?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.006
No

05:39.039 --> 05:42.042
I just don't understand, Ronnie.
We spoke every day.

05:42.075 --> 05:46.013
There was flirting and chemistry
and... suggestive emojis.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.716
That wasn't suggestive. I really
was washing an eggplant.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.385
At least finish the text for me.
You just can't what?

05:51.419 --> 05:54.154
You can't find parking?
You can't pick an outfit?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.189
-I just can't this.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.225
You want to know why
I canceled, Colin?

05:58.258 --> 06:00.160
Because you
freaked me out, okay?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.729
You freaked me out.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.031
-Excuse me.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.202
What kind?
-Symbolic key lime.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.505
Oh, I like coconut cream.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.874
-That's nice for you.
-No, it's not.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.910
I'm allergic to coconut.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.550
Uh... Shalom, guys.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.519
-One large beer, please.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.589
13, but I'm a man
tomorrow, so...

06:28.622 --> 06:30.924
-Well, give me a ding
in eight years. -I can't.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.193
Men and women can't be alone
together unless they're married.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.395
Wow. That actually sounds
really good to me right now.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.864
Maybe I should convert.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.567
Well, we're always looking
for girls like you.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.873
This is your captain--

06:45.906 --> 06:48.942
and one of Aviator Magazine's
top ten pilots to watch--

06:48.976 --> 06:51.278
here to give you
a little reminder.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.946
Just because you pay for sex

06:52.980 --> 06:54.948
doesn't mean
you have to pay a lot.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.416
So do what I do.

06:56.450 --> 07:00.220
Go to Madame Kitty's Ranch
off the 6.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.955
Because you deserve
to get a hando

07:01.989 --> 07:03.724
without paying an arm and a leg.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.559
Ten pilots to watch.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.760
Can you believe it?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.729
Lot of big names
have been on that list.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.466
-Sully, Travolta, Chewbacca.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.102
No, the hairy Austrian
that flies for Delta.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.904
And you know who's
never been on that list?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.272
Stupid Captain Steve.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.742
-Catalog model.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.812
And this isn't about him.
This is about me.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.981
I tell you, Alan,
this article is the thing

07:28.015 --> 07:32.085
that's finally gonna
make my career take off.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.763
-Uh... yeah.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.632
That was... that was nothing.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.600
I think it was your fault.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
-I'm not touching anything.
-Well, maybe you should've been!

07:52.005 --> 07:54.842
Because everyone believes
that Ben Affleck killed her,

07:54.875 --> 07:57.177
so he has to go
to Madea for help.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.479
Turns out the girl is not gone.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.949
No, she is at
Doogie Howser's house.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.617
I thought she was at Barney

08:03.651 --> 08:05.152
from How I Met
Your Mother's house.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.988
You read it, too?
What about you my friend?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.326
Hello, friend, are you okay?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.663
Hello?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.303
Oh, no.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.372
Yeah. No.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.974
I think he's Gone Girl.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.209
BOTH:
Ronnie!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.382
-I don't know.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.885
Bernard took the emergency
manual; he's checking.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.690
Yep, he's super dead.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.491
I never had anyone die
on my watch before.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.893
We should cover him
with something.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.661
We could cover him
with my Hogwarts cloak.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.897
Damn it, Alan, no one cares
about Star Trek.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.399
Even if we wanted to use
Alan's gross cloak, we can't.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.568
Airline protocol says we can't
officially acknowledge death

08:54.602 --> 08:56.870
on the plane;
we have to wait until we land.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.538
Then he's pronounced dead
on the tarmac.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.041
-That's how I want to go.
-It's probably best not to draw

09:01.074 --> 09:02.576
any more attention
to him anyway.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.911
We don't want any of
the other passengers

09:03.944 --> 09:05.713
to start freaking out.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.553
It was the Ruth Bader Ginsburg
comment, wasn't it?

09:13.587 --> 09:15.756
That's what freaked you out.
I was joking.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.191
Of course I believe
she has legs under that robe.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.760
I can't even describe
how not the time this is.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.528
You can't just tell somebody
they freaked you out

09:21.561 --> 09:23.396
and then drop it--
it lacks couth.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.767
-You lack couth.
-I have a buttload of couth!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.202
You were just
so damn intense, okay?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.204
Like when we were
planning the dinner.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.607
It should be pretty simple,
right? I counted.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.743
You sent me 14 Yelp pages,
five different menus,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.577
and one article
about how L.A. is

09:37.611 --> 09:39.212
in the middle of a pickle boom?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.615
Renaissance.
Pickle renaissance.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.786
Hi. Um, I think
my button's broken.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.457
Nichole,
did you need something?

09:50.490 --> 09:53.060
Um, yeah.
Look, I don't want to be a pain,

09:53.093 --> 09:55.462
but is there anything
you can do about, um...

09:55.495 --> 09:58.899
I'm sorry. It's a full flight.
There's nowhere to put him.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.567
And we're trying to be discreet,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.570
but I do have something
I think will help.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.074
These were in
the lost and found.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
"YOLO." So true.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.912
:
Um, okay.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.814
There's got to be
something you can do

10:13.847 --> 10:15.949
to make me feel better
about this.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.151
-Well, like, in college,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.087
if your roommate dies,
you get straight A's

10:20.120 --> 10:21.789
for the rest of the semester.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.091
I would know because my roommate
actually tried to kill herself,

10:24.124 --> 10:25.793
but totally blew it
at the last second.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.461
It got me so upset, I don't even
want to talk about it.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.131
Wait, were you upset because she
tried or because it didn't work?

10:31.164 --> 10:33.100
No, Ronnie, because she broke
the ceiling fan.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.169
Look, all I'm saying is that
some people might say

10:36.203 --> 10:41.608
that a dead seatmate is way more
traumatic than a dead roommate.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.844
Fine. How about I start
counting strippers

10:43.877 --> 10:46.179
as military
for early boarding purposes?

10:46.213 --> 10:49.482
Great. People are always
thanking me for my service.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.191
Landing.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.460
Landing. No problem.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.965
Done it a million times before.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.136
Why do you keep paying
so much attention to me?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.505
: No.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.342
-This is the back of the plane.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.644
Well, Captain Dave said I was
getting a little too worked up,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.646
-so I needed a juice time-out.
-Oh, fine. Here.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.815
Just dilute it with water
so you don't go hyper again.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.817
: Oh.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.652
Okay. So Nichole seems
to be under control.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.889
-Well...

11:28.922 --> 11:30.357
I feel so guilty.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.826
Do you know my first thought
when I saw he's dead?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.728
"I should've made
airplane death pool."

11:34.762 --> 11:36.764
I'm a terrible person.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.202
-I feel no better.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.005
This duck is broken.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.174
He'll be fine.
Darryl's a pro.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.708
Call me crazy, but I think

11:48.742 --> 11:50.744
we're actually gonna
get away with this.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.250
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.853
Everything's okay.
The dead guy's alive.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.389
That's not the dead guy.
This is the dead guy.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.095
And that, everyone,

12:08.128 --> 12:10.864
is why you should always
turn off your cell phones.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.232
So true.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.738
To anyone feeling uneasy,
don't worry,

12:18.772 --> 12:20.908
we'll be starting our descent
any moment.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.043
And for the rest of you, I can't
believe I have to say this,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.545
please stop taking selfies
with the body.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.416
-You look bummed.
-Yeah.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.286
A man's death forces you
to consider your own legacy.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.756
And for me, that legacy
is a black-hearted coward,

12:36.790 --> 12:40.627
confused with the films
of Ben Affleck.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.096
Well, there's still time
to change that.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.566
The Talmud says a man's legacy
is not sealed upon his death,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.936
but upon every moment
which he lives.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.770
-Oh, that's comforting.
-Yeah.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.440
-I don't know.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.409
People listen to you more
when you say the Talmud says it.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.279
No one's actually read it,
so no one can call you out.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.748
Thank you. I feel much better.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.782
-Yeah.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.784
Hey, uh, can you get me a beer?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.653
No, you cannot trick me,
little policeman.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.458
-Yeah.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.660
Hi. Um, since the secret's out,

13:13.693 --> 13:15.795
could you do something
about this?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.297
Just hang tight, okay?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.832
We're gonna be landing
any minute.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.433
Just be normal!

13:20.467 --> 13:21.935
Can you please just move him?

13:21.969 --> 13:25.272
I can suppress anything, but
even I'm reaching my limit here.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.307
Okay.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.612
Ooh. You want to play a game?
Heads or tails?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.015
Heads?

13:35.048 --> 13:38.351
Yeah, I'm not sure
this game had a winner.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.953
I'm sorry
you're stuck doing this.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.355
I asked Bernard for help,
but he just reminded me

13:42.389 --> 13:44.657
how much his hand cream cost,
then walked away.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.959
It's quite all right.
In many ways,

13:45.993 --> 13:47.660
this is the perfect metaphor
for us.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.696
Oh. Pretty quippy for a guy
holding a dead body.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.331
I am pretending he is a rug.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.166
I'm pretending
I've never done this before.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.305
All right, what's going on?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.806
Nothing.
What are you talking about?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.808
Tell me. Or I'll tell everyone
what happened

14:01.841 --> 14:04.811
-the night we were grounded
in Billings. -You wouldn't.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.647
We both agreed
Billings was a mistake.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.816
Okay, look.
When I was in high school,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.886
I was a star football player,
big man on campus.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.488
Hands down,
the best punter in the district.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.657
In fact, it was my punt
that got us

14:17.690 --> 14:19.492
into the state
championship game.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.828
-That sounds wrong.
-It was right after that game

14:21.861 --> 14:26.033
that I got a... I got a hitch
in my-my kicking motion.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.001
Almost like a...
like a stutter kick.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.736
You're talking about the yips.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.005
It was the most challenging
time of my life.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.740
That was the most challenging
time of your life?

14:33.773 --> 14:35.342
I watched my neighbor drown.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.377
The point is, the same thing's
happening to me right now.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.847
Every time I grab my yoke...
my hands go crazy.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.216
I can't land this thing.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.087
Well, if we're gonna die,
I'm gonna have some carbs.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.365
Ugh! God.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.866
Thank you.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.369
And I am sorry for canceling.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.037
In retrospect,
I should've just said

15:04.071 --> 15:06.739
"Let's bang one out
and hit the pancake house."

15:06.773 --> 15:10.577
I like pancake's house.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.213
Look, Colin,
we're just too different.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.415
I really did us a favor
by not showing up.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.385
It's like when you know
a massive storm is rolling in.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.053
You don't fly into it.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.889
They cancel, and you go
get drunk at the airport bar.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.292
Out of curiosity,
how many of your analogies end

15:25.325 --> 15:27.894
with "and get drunk
in the airport bar"?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.762
Ronnie, we have a problem.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.466
And it's not even that.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.735
-Would everyone please

15:35.768 --> 15:37.437
stop saying that word?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.272
I-I have dead body
all over my hands.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.108
I will use whatever word I want.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.243
Why don't you just
let Alan land the plane?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.578
Because Aviator Magazine named
me a top ten pilot to watch.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.781
The only list Alan is on is the
top ten people who can suck it.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.950
Ew. God...

15:50.984 --> 15:52.852
Alan.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.323
We need you, buddy. You're up.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.758
Me?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.793
Yeah.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.662
*

16:09.136 --> 16:10.303
-RONNIE: Oh, my God!

16:10.337 --> 16:12.139
BERNARD:
Out of the way, out of the way!

16:15.142 --> 16:16.776
It's okay, everyone.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.146
According to the manual,
he's still alive.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.353
Just curious,
how terrified should we be

16:26.386 --> 16:27.787
about all of this?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.689
Depends.
You know how to cure the yips?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.124
Wait, my friend Krystal
had that.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.459
Her fingers kept locking up

16:32.492 --> 16:34.327
every time she tried
to unsnap her bra.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.663
She had to stop dancing, but now
she runs the club's day care,

16:36.696 --> 16:38.498
Little Grapefruits.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.168
I still can't believe they got
approved as a Montessori.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.404
-Oh, God.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.709
All right.
We're landing this plane.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.512
-Oh, you can fly. Thank God.
-No, but you can.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.647
And I am going
to help you through it.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.184
This all started with
the magazine article, right?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.985
That's good.
That means it's all mental.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.553
Just like your high school
football thing.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.190
So how did you get over it
when you were a punter?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.158
I quit the team,
transferred schools,

17:05.192 --> 17:08.161
and now can't go near a football
without having a panic attack.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.662
Okay. That's not helpful.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.998
I guess the best way to get
over this is to quit Jackpot,

17:12.031 --> 17:14.033
switch careers
and become a train conductor.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.735
Conductor Dave.
Yeah, that sounds good.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.404
I'll be one of
Railroad Magazine's

17:17.437 --> 17:19.739
top ten conductors to watch.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.842
Oh, God, the pressure.
I can't land this train!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
Oh, my God.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.880
BERNARD:
This is the most depressing

17:27.914 --> 17:31.351
travel experience I've ever had,
and I was on the Titanic.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.221
Movie set.
Billy Zane has some demons.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.189
I'd never seen
a dead body before.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.358
In Britain, you try to die
like a cat:

17:38.391 --> 17:41.060
in a quiet corner,
burdening no one.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.263
Yeah, listen up, everybody.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.897
Enough sadness.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.367
This man is dead,
but we are not.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.704
And if I have learned anything
from this tiny rabbi here today,

17:51.738 --> 17:56.243
it is that we must make
most of life while we have it!

17:57.744 --> 17:59.946
So come, let us all celebrate

17:59.979 --> 18:02.749
that we're not dead, or Alan.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.553
No. Let us rejoice.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.259
* Hava nagila? *

18:13.660 --> 18:17.897
* Hava nagila... *

18:17.930 --> 18:20.800
* Ve-nis'mecha *

18:20.833 --> 18:22.635
-Yeah! * Hava... *
-* Hava *

18:22.669 --> 18:25.405
* Nagila, hava nagila *

18:25.438 --> 18:29.142
* Hava nagila *

18:29.176 --> 18:30.643
* Ve-nis'mecha *

18:30.677 --> 18:35.148
* Hava neranena,
hava neranena... *

18:35.182 --> 18:39.286
Look, I know this whole top ten
thing has gotten to your head.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.089
But that's not pressure.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.326
Real pressure is safely flying
a plane full of people

18:46.359 --> 18:50.597
who are all counting on you
to get them to their jobs.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.765
To get them to their families.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.668
To get them to the people
they're going to help.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.340
And you already do that
every day.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.343
So put aside the what-ifs

19:03.376 --> 19:07.280
and all the ways this could
go wrong, and just do it.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.782
WOMAN : Jackpot 320,
you are cleared to land.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.019
So what do you think, Captain?
You want to land this thing?

19:16.389 --> 19:20.360
Las Vegas tower,
this is Jackpot 3-2-0.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.695
Mark her inbound.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.198
Ready to land.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.866
Ah!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.338
Yeah! We did it!

19:31.371 --> 19:34.341
We're going to Vegas!

19:35.908 --> 19:37.877
DAVE:
Hello, passengers.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.879
Sorry for the delay;
wasn't my fault.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.481
Welcome to Las Vegas.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.051
It's called Grapefruits,
and yeah,

19:45.084 --> 19:46.853
as long as you have
a letter from a rabbi

19:46.886 --> 19:49.489
saying you're a man,
they'll totally let you in.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.823
-* Hello, hello, Vegas *

19:50.857 --> 19:52.659
* We are here to play *

19:52.692 --> 19:54.527
* Hello, hello, Vegas *

19:54.561 --> 19:56.028
* Gold will come our way *

19:56.062 --> 19:57.564
* Hey! *

19:59.366 --> 20:01.334
Colin. Colin, hi.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.003
Hey, um, I've been thinking.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.205
Let's do it. You and me.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.241
Let's put aside
all the what-ifs

20:08.275 --> 20:10.209
and all things
that could go wrong,

20:10.243 --> 20:12.178
and the public arguments
in restaurants,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.747
the breakups, the makeups,
the pregnancy scares,

20:14.781 --> 20:17.517
so many pregnancy scares.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.519
So I say let's fly
into the storm,

20:19.552 --> 20:23.590
let it tear the plane apart,
and see if we both survive.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.725
What do you think?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.927
You want to do this thing?

20:27.960 --> 20:31.864
No. That sounds awful.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.033
Why would we put ourselves
through any of that?

20:34.066 --> 20:37.203
Up till now, our relationship
has been 90% fighting,

20:37.236 --> 20:40.039
seven percent
holding a dead body,

20:40.072 --> 20:42.409
and three percent making out
in a tiny bathroom.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.711
This isn't gonna work.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.379
Yeah.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.947
-Yep. Yeah, you're right.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.716
Uh, you're totally right.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.219
I think I was just coming off
a high from landing the plane,

20:53.252 --> 20:56.723
uh, but now that you say it,
it makes sense.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.592
Well, okay.
I will see you Sunday.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.897
Hello. This is
Captain Dave Pratman,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.566
top ten pilot to watch,
returning a call

21:06.599 --> 21:07.967
about a photo shoot tomorrow.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.236
Just want to confirm
that it's not a practical joke.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.605
I've been burned before.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.906
Great.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.811
* You don't get it *

21:18.845 --> 21:22.915
* You don't get it,
you don't get it... *

21:22.949 --> 21:25.852
I like it dirty.
And I don't mean the martini.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.823
This is the smoking section.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.659
Boom.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.662
* You don't get it,
you don't get it... *

You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.270
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.140
It's time we fly
this old bird.

21:48.174 --> 21:51.110
* It feels good *

21:51.143 --> 21:54.013
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

21:54.046 --> 21:54.847
I can help you.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.816
* It feels good *

21:56.849 --> 21:58.451
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

21:58.485 --> 21:59.819
No, you never
touch this.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.621
* You know it feels good *

22:01.654 --> 22:03.289
-* It feels good *

22:03.322 --> 22:05.191
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:05.224 --> 22:07.293
Let's do it.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.662
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.666
Unbelievable.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.334
* It feels good *
