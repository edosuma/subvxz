Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:05.010 --> 00:06.440
Can you tell us
the child's sex?

00:06.480 --> 00:07.990
It's a boy.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.360
We're gonna have
a son. [laughs]

00:09.360 --> 00:11.360
[panting]

00:11.590 --> 00:16.230
[Ihab] <i>Abu Omar tortures,
slaughters innocent civilians.</i>

00:16.260 --> 00:18.630
What kind of person does
these things?

00:18.670 --> 00:20.080
I could.

00:20.110 --> 00:23.660
[Jamal] I've appointed a new commander
of our armed forces.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.670
<i>General Said has
already been conferring</i>

00:26.710 --> 00:28.380
<i>with top military advisors</i>

00:28.420 --> 00:31.440
<i>and readying
for our counteroffensive</i>

00:31.470 --> 00:33.350
<i>against the invaders.</i>

00:33.380 --> 00:35.280
The terms
of the trust specify

00:35.310 --> 00:37.680
that the money passes
along the male line.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.770
<i>Samuel has inherited
$100 million.</i>

00:40.810 --> 00:41.820
Looking for Yaser.

00:41.860 --> 00:45.110
During the fighting in Ma'an,
nine men took refuge

00:45.150 --> 00:46.710
in a closed nightclub.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.920
The Caliphate
found them.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.790
Abdul? Was he one of the
men in... in the nightclub?

00:50.830 --> 00:51.760
He was.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.470
You belong
to Abu Omar now.

00:53.510 --> 00:54.810
You will obey him,

00:54.850 --> 00:57.670
do what he wants
whenever he wants it.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.840
[guns firing]
[people screaming]

00:59.870 --> 01:02.030
Ghani needs Daliyah.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.410
Find her.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.769
Promise me.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.610
I'll find her.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.480
I swear.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.820
â™ª

01:35.170 --> 01:36.490
[guard] This way.

01:43.610 --> 01:45.610
Right here.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.320
[breathing anxiously]

01:52.320 --> 01:54.320
[door opens]

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
[door closes]

02:13.040 --> 02:15.040
You've made
some changes.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.240
Mm-hmm.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.250
It's nice of
you to notice.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.420
I take it you
and my son speak.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.350
He arranged this visit?

02:29.190 --> 02:32.590
Ahmed and I are
still friends.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.430
I came to see my uncle.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.990
Your uncle is the president.
He doesn't see visitors.

02:37.030 --> 02:39.000
Family.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.100
Happy to wait.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.610
I think you've misinterpreted
our kindness

02:51.650 --> 02:54.640
in letting you remain here.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.650
You're not completely free
to come and go as you please.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.330
Well, this is Abuddin.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.380
No one assumes that.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.520
This is not how
I remember you.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.360
It's nice of you
to notice.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.330
No.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.900
It's not how I was.

03:14.930 --> 03:17.900
My father's dead now,
so I've had to...

03:17.930 --> 03:19.930
You know.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.550
Can you tell my uncle that
I'm here, please, [sighs] Aunt Leila?

03:33.010 --> 03:35.120
I already did.

03:37.270 --> 03:39.490
[Nusrat] You look nice.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.720
It suits you.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.590
- You think so?
- Yeah.

03:42.620 --> 03:46.190
I always worry I look like I'm
dressing for a costume party.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.190
[laughs]

03:50.430 --> 03:52.320
Why aren't you moving?

03:52.350 --> 03:53.820
Don't know.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.440
I don't feel so good.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.440
Baby thing?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.440
Probably.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.870
What's this
all about anyway?

04:01.060 --> 04:04.010
[exhales] Something about Dad and
Rami wanting to make a fuss

04:04.040 --> 04:06.190
over our new troops.

04:06.230 --> 04:08.010
I suppose
it's good for morale.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.300
It's not good
for mine.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.230
Do you mind if I stay
in bed and skip it?

04:12.230 --> 04:14.930
[watchband clicks]

04:15.910 --> 04:17.870
Don't do that to me.

04:17.910 --> 04:20.350
I'm trying to make a go
at being good at my job.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.060
I know.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.510
That's what you
wanted, right?

04:23.540 --> 04:26.780
No more begging off,
making excuses?

04:26.780 --> 04:28.050
[Nusrat exhales]

04:28.050 --> 04:29.520
Well...

04:29.570 --> 04:31.910
we're a team,
aren't we?

04:32.060 --> 04:34.060
[both laugh]

04:34.060 --> 04:36.560
[door opens]

04:36.560 --> 04:38.360
Sammy.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.960
[door closes]
What's this about?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.730
Family reunion?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.920
I'm asking you
as an Al Fayeed

04:44.960 --> 04:47.530
for the money
that my grandfather left to me.

04:47.570 --> 04:50.840
Well, the court will
decide that, not me.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.110
Uncle, the court waits
for you. I know that.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.840
Be careful
what you say to me.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.060
I'm not afraid of you.

05:02.090 --> 05:06.070
In my mind,
you're the uncle...

05:06.100 --> 05:08.330
who took me sailing,
taught me how to fish,

05:08.360 --> 05:09.950
even though I never got
the hang of that,

05:09.980 --> 05:10.940
went to Disneyland with.

05:10.990 --> 05:14.990
You are my crazy
Uncle Jamal, my favorite.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.840
And you're not punishing
my father. He's dead.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.280
You're punishing me.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.930
It's more complicated
than you think.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.940
Okay.

05:26.970 --> 05:30.170
Would you want Ahmed
to pay for your mistakes?

05:30.210 --> 05:34.030
I'm trying to figure out exactly
how I fit into all of this

05:34.060 --> 05:37.010
and I'm thinking that maybe
you're my family. Am I wrong?

05:41.220 --> 05:45.090
I will arrange to transfer money
to you from a Swiss account.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.090
Not $100 million.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.120
Not all at once.
$10 million.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.660
Then you go. You leave, Sammy,
and don't come back again.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.140
Over the next
few months

05:56.170 --> 05:57.870
we'll make
arrangement for

05:57.900 --> 06:00.170
the balance of the estate.
Okay?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.340
Okay.

06:03.370 --> 06:06.410
Good. Very good.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.440
Good.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.810
[sighs]

06:10.810 --> 06:13.500
You were my favorite, too.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.120
[door opens]

06:24.230 --> 06:26.880
They have locked down
the city, block by block,

06:26.910 --> 06:28.600
in response to
the prison break.

06:28.630 --> 06:31.560
Every day we wait, it gets
harder for us to move around.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.300
Or rally support.
Even with Halima's stories

06:34.330 --> 06:36.370
of Abu Khalil
and the Red Hand.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.330
You've exploded
on social media.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.200
Ihab Rashid has become very good
at the carrot and the stick.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.680
Oppose us
and we'll kill you.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.300
Join us and we'll
give you a job.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.780
Half the population
is living better

06:45.820 --> 06:47.080
than they did under
the Al Fayeeds.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.650
The men, maybe.
Not the women.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.130
The Christians are nervous.
For good reason.

06:51.170 --> 06:52.660
We might find
some support there.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.690
And with
the Banu Isa, we...

06:53.690 --> 06:54.820
No, there's
always been tension

06:54.850 --> 06:55.990
between us and the Banu Isa.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.440
Which you will need
to set aside.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.690
We have to reach out
to every potential ally.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.730
- We need weapons.
- That, too.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.130
[phone rings]

07:04.160 --> 07:05.800
Munir?

07:05.840 --> 07:08.320
[whispers] I found Daliyah.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.200
[Munir] It's over here.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.700
The refinery
manager's old house.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.880
That's where they're
holding Daliyah.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.500
I think.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.680
What?

07:20.710 --> 07:22.980
It's the best I can do.
I haven't been inside.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.820
It's their
main compound.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.960
Abu Omar lives here.
And Ihab bin Rashid.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.220
They're all together.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.480
We don't have the resources
to penetrate that.

07:31.510 --> 07:32.990
Tonight Omar's
brother,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.760
the emir, arrives
from Aleppo.

07:34.790 --> 07:37.460
There's a meeting
at the Hamra Hotel.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.050
And a dinner.
Till morning.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.230
No one at the compound

07:41.270 --> 07:42.770
but a few guards.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.410
I've got to get back
before they miss me.

07:47.410 --> 07:51.810
Okay. Be careful.
Thank you.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.110
Mr. President.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.650
These are
your weapons.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.400
The officers of your army,
the first and second battalions.

08:01.430 --> 08:03.900
Your air forces' elite
flying squadron,

08:03.940 --> 08:07.610
the al-Nusur, who will lead the
first forays over Ma'an City.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.520
Air force, present arms!
[footsteps thump]

08:10.560 --> 08:13.260
Orders arm.
[footsteps thump]

08:25.910 --> 08:29.110
Sons of this soil,

08:29.140 --> 08:32.610
I put my faith in you

08:32.650 --> 08:35.630
as the finest
fighting force

08:35.669 --> 08:38.380
Abuddin has ever known.

08:38.419 --> 08:41.980
Side by side with compatriots

08:42.010 --> 08:44.020
from across the globe...

08:45.060 --> 08:47.690
you have
one purpose:

08:47.730 --> 08:50.300
to rid this country

08:50.330 --> 08:52.330
- of the invaders...
- Ahmed.

08:52.370 --> 08:53.770
[Jamal] ...who would
subvert Islam

08:53.800 --> 08:56.130
- [Jamal] and enslave our people.
- Ahmed, I'm bleeding.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.770
- What?
- I'm bleeding.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.470
[Jamal] They have come on
a wave of terror,

09:01.510 --> 09:02.910
but we will
push them back...

09:02.940 --> 09:04.580
- Oh! Oh...
- Nusrat... Nusrat!

09:04.610 --> 09:06.280
What's happening?
[people murmuring]

09:06.280 --> 09:09.000
It's okay, just stay calm.
[people murmuring]

09:09.030 --> 09:09.950
[whimpering]

09:09.980 --> 09:11.020
[indistinct chatter]

09:13.420 --> 09:15.150
[Leila] Get an
ambulance.

09:15.190 --> 09:17.120
Everybody
give her room.

10:03.950 --> 10:08.800
Tyrant S02E07

10:09.850 --> 10:19.050
Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

10:24.280 --> 10:28.170
- To Sammy.
- Really? We're doing the toasting again?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.940
Yeah. He did a hell
of a thing today. [glasses clink]

10:29.970 --> 10:31.620
Yeah, he did.
To Sammy.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.160
To Sammy.
[low hum of chat in background]

10:33.160 --> 10:34.180
[low hum of chat in background]

10:34.180 --> 10:37.950
Did you even know
about Abdul

10:37.990 --> 10:40.120
before we got here?

10:40.150 --> 10:41.190
No.

10:41.220 --> 10:43.580
I don't think this was just
about Abdul or ransom.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.530
I think this is Sammy staking
a claim to who he really is.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.300
Well, I think
that's wonderful.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.760
Yeah.
It's kind of amazing.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.570
So you let him go
to the club tonight?

10:54.600 --> 10:55.930
I didn't want to.
Trust me.

10:55.970 --> 10:57.970
I don't care
how grown up he is.

10:58.010 --> 11:00.270
But I couldn't...

11:00.310 --> 11:02.980
I don't know what
the rules are anymore.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.710
Hey, tell me about it.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.350
Alice and I were
really strict parents.

11:07.380 --> 11:11.020
- Really?
- I know, me? Hard to believe.

11:11.050 --> 11:14.970
After she died, [sighs]
Leslie came to me...

11:14.970 --> 11:16.520
14 years old,
mind you...

11:16.560 --> 11:18.400
and asked
if she could get

11:18.400 --> 11:21.230
a tiny tattoo
on her ankle.

11:21.260 --> 11:24.800
And I... I thought...

11:24.850 --> 11:27.600
who the hell cares?

11:29.100 --> 11:31.960
Then she asked me
if I'd get one with her.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.520
Do you have a very tiny

11:35.560 --> 11:37.410
matching tattoo
on your ankle?

11:37.440 --> 11:39.180
A red rose.

11:39.210 --> 11:40.910
With the words "Born Dead."

11:40.940 --> 11:42.180
Oh, no!

11:42.180 --> 11:43.610
[chuckles]

11:43.610 --> 11:45.880
I made you laugh.

11:47.550 --> 11:50.600
One of the many things
you've done for me.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.960
Heaven and Earth, Molly.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.960
[people speak indistinctly in background]

11:57.490 --> 11:58.590
[waiter] Here you go.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.630
Thank you.

12:02.370 --> 12:06.140
Her placenta has separated
from the wall of her uterus.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.140
That's what's
causing her to bleed.

12:08.170 --> 12:10.330
It happens
in about

12:10.360 --> 12:12.610
one in 200
deliveries.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.610
Just bad luck.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.340
I'm afraid so.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.980
I'm going to have to operate
and deliver the baby

12:19.020 --> 12:20.350
in order to stop
the bleeding.

12:20.390 --> 12:21.520
Isn't that too soon?

12:21.550 --> 12:23.280
The fetus is at 24 weeks.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.090
What are the chances
of survival at that age?

12:26.130 --> 12:26.920
In general,

12:26.950 --> 12:28.960
between 40% and 70%.

12:28.990 --> 12:31.590
[sighs] Ooh.

12:31.630 --> 12:33.630
But if I don't deliver
right now,

12:33.700 --> 12:37.090
Nusrat's chances of survival
are much, much less.

12:38.060 --> 12:40.360
I'll be in touch as soon
as we have some news.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.740
Try and stay positive.

12:44.870 --> 12:48.370
She clearly
doesn't know the family.

12:48.410 --> 12:50.880
[indistinct conversations]

12:55.050 --> 12:56.420
Remember me?

12:56.450 --> 12:58.420
I remember.

12:58.450 --> 12:59.920
What do you want?

12:59.950 --> 13:01.980
You know how we talked
about raising money

13:02.010 --> 13:03.370
to ransom
the Ma'an Nine?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.420
Forget about it.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.620
Well...

13:05.660 --> 13:08.930
I know I may have seemed crazy
at the time, but...

13:08.960 --> 13:10.160
I got it.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.500
They're dead.

13:14.930 --> 13:16.170
What?

13:16.200 --> 13:18.060
They're dead.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.930
There's no ransoming
dead people.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.640
You're too late.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.690
You told me the trial
wouldn't be for days.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.880
I'll show you the videotape
if you want.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.810
They blindfolded them all,

13:29.850 --> 13:32.460
they took them
to the top of a building,

13:32.500 --> 13:34.220
they tied them to chairs

13:34.250 --> 13:36.050
and threw them off.

13:36.090 --> 13:38.620
They're all gone.

13:40.590 --> 13:41.920
All of them?

13:41.960 --> 13:44.190
Yes.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.460
What?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.430
You lost a friend,
did you, hmm?

13:51.470 --> 13:53.340
An exotic crush?

13:53.370 --> 13:56.270
I lost six friends.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.610
I lost a lover.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.710
His partner.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.750
20 years.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.050
Don't mind Yaser.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.620
Not tonight.

14:08.650 --> 14:11.890
There's a memorial
in the square for them

14:11.920 --> 14:13.520
in about an hour.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.890
You should come.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.680
For your friend.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.530
[soft thud]

14:43.520 --> 14:44.720
Daliyah.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.190
Kh... Khalil?

14:49.860 --> 14:51.660
What...
What are you...?

14:51.690 --> 14:52.690
Is there a key?

14:52.730 --> 14:54.560
With Abu Omar, yes.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.400
[panting]

14:56.430 --> 14:58.460
I...
[clanging]

14:58.500 --> 15:00.300
I can't believe
you're actually here.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.400
You know what I thought
this whole time?

15:01.440 --> 15:03.090
I thought,
"I can't be wrong about him,

15:03.130 --> 15:04.560
it's not possible."

15:04.560 --> 15:06.560
[shattering]
[hinges squeaking]

15:07.170 --> 15:09.340
- [Daliyah gasps]
- [Bassam] Mmm.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.740
I have excellent
intuition.

15:13.810 --> 15:15.810
[Daliyah breaths heavily]

15:15.810 --> 15:17.780
What happened
to my family?

15:17.820 --> 15:18.780
You have to tell me.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.650
I'll tell you after.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.020
We need to get out of here.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.170
No. Now.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.200
Ghani...

15:24.230 --> 15:24.900
Ghani's fine.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.360
He's safe in Tal Jiza.

15:26.390 --> 15:27.860
And Ahmos?

15:31.610 --> 15:34.300
Daliyah, I'm sorry.
We have to go.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.730
[Samira] What
are you doing?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.500
Answer me, Bakru.

15:38.540 --> 15:42.380
- [Daliyah whimpers]
- Why have you left your post?

15:42.410 --> 15:43.420
Abu Omar told me

15:43.460 --> 15:46.670
to bring her
to him.

15:46.670 --> 15:47.850
[Samira] I don't believe you.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.250
Turn around.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.510
[gun cocks]

15:51.550 --> 15:52.720
Bakru.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.270
I have
a weapon, Bakru.

15:54.310 --> 15:56.550
Don't be stupid.
Turn around and face me.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.330
You're not Bakru.
Who are you?

16:06.360 --> 16:08.230
No one.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.540
Put the gun down,
let us walk out of here

16:10.570 --> 16:11.630
and I won't hurt you.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.800
Very funny.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
I'm better at this
than you think.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.010
You look...

16:20.040 --> 16:21.710
Show me your face.

16:22.740 --> 16:23.910
Now!

16:23.940 --> 16:25.510
Do as I say!

16:26.710 --> 16:28.720
[exhales]

16:30.620 --> 16:31.980
What?

16:33.920 --> 16:37.190
I know you, but...

16:37.220 --> 16:39.560
No, it's not,
it's not possible.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.560
Bassam Al Fayeed.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.370
What?

16:46.400 --> 16:47.600
I don't...

16:47.630 --> 16:48.530
You didn't know?

16:48.570 --> 16:49.590
No.

16:49.630 --> 16:50.230
I'll tell you everything.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.670
It's a long story.

16:55.170 --> 16:57.740
What are you doing
here, Samira?

17:04.220 --> 17:06.750
[Barry] So I ended up
back in Ma'an.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.319
[Samira] What
a cosmic joke.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.819
Everything went to shit
after you died, you know that?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.859
Put it on the floor.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.859
[knife clangs]

17:16.859 --> 17:18.430
So... [exhales deeply]

17:18.460 --> 17:21.170
you came here
to rescue her.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.930
Are you in love
with her?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.839
You should get in line.

17:26.869 --> 17:28.140
I'm married.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.840
I came here
to take my country back.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.610
You should get in line.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.180
So what now?

17:36.220 --> 17:38.650
What are you doing here
by yourself, anyway?

17:38.690 --> 17:41.220
Oh, I screwed up your plans,
did I?

17:41.250 --> 17:42.930
I wasn't feeling well.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.230
I begged off tonight
at the last minute.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.430
Are you going to kill us?

17:48.470 --> 17:49.560
No.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.560
No, uh,

17:51.700 --> 17:52.670
I'm going to keep you here

17:52.670 --> 17:55.370
until my husband and Abu Omar
return in a few minutes.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.670
Longer than
a few minutes.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.910
It's a big meeting and dinner
that you're missing.

17:59.940 --> 18:01.810
There's not going to be anyone
back here till morning.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.090
They'll come back
when I call them on the phone.

18:04.130 --> 18:04.920
[Barry] What phone?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.710
There are no land lines
left in the city

18:06.750 --> 18:07.530
and you don't have

18:07.560 --> 18:08.600
a cell phone
anymore.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.160
You joined a movement
that thinks

18:10.160 --> 18:11.840
a woman having
a phone should be

18:11.880 --> 18:14.120
- punishable by death.
- You should shut up.

18:14.150 --> 18:16.290
Samira, please.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.290
Just... come with us.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.300
[laughs]

18:19.330 --> 18:21.360
Your father sent me
baby pictures of you.

18:21.390 --> 18:23.680
We're not meant to be enemies.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.330
Would you kill Ihab tomorrow,

18:29.370 --> 18:31.510
if you had the chance?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.170
Okay, then.

18:36.210 --> 18:39.820
Who's to say
what we're meant to be, Khalil?

18:41.440 --> 18:43.680
Go sit over there
on the floor.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.170
Both of you!

18:56.890 --> 18:59.130
We will wait
until they come back.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.300
I can't let that happen.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.980
Just so you know.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.190
I won't be a hostage.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.970
[sighs]

19:09.000 --> 19:11.900
I'll shoot her
if you move.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.900
[Daliyah shivering]

19:19.750 --> 19:21.280
[chuckles]

19:21.310 --> 19:25.280
Catastrophe helps take
one's mind off tragedy.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.050
Come on. Spit it out.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.860
My only option today
is an air attack.

19:30.890 --> 19:34.560
But if I move too quickly,
with too little information,

19:34.590 --> 19:36.860
I'm just as likely
to hit civilians as the enemy.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.900
The world is watching, Rami.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.730
- I know.
- All of us.

19:40.770 --> 19:43.320
And me in particular.
They're watching,

19:43.360 --> 19:46.250
looking for clues to whether
we are going to survive.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.850
Right now all they see is
that we have lost control

19:49.880 --> 19:52.100
over our second
largest city.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.950
I need you
to pick up the pace.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.320
[clanking on phone keyborad]

20:00.320 --> 20:02.690
Solomon.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.240
I need you
to double the number

20:04.270 --> 20:06.090
of reconnaissance flights
over Ma'an.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.830
No. Day and night.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.830
I know.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.560
I'll take that risk.

20:18.870 --> 20:21.940
You're under stress, Father.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.940
I understand.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.680
Today is
a terrible day,

20:26.710 --> 20:29.580
not a day to make decisions
that you'll regret later.

20:39.890 --> 20:43.080
[Molly] <i>You know what, let me just...
I'm just gonna</i>

20:43.110 --> 20:44.770
go make sure he's

20:44.800 --> 20:46.470
- back and that's he's okay.
- No, just leave him alone.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.110
- No, no, no, no, no. Just let me...
- No. Hey, hey, hey.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.090
He'll appreciate
the confidence.

20:50.130 --> 20:52.600
[sighs] Okay.

20:53.630 --> 20:56.100
[both] Okay.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.040
Okay.

20:57.070 --> 20:59.470
So, that's...

21:01.480 --> 21:04.940
- [James chuckles]
- [Molly chuckles] Yeah.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.850
This is kind of
a clichÃ©.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.180
- Really?
- Hmm.

21:08.210 --> 21:11.320
[chuckles] Yeah.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.830
James.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.670
[sighs]

21:29.700 --> 21:33.040
It's too soon.

21:33.070 --> 21:36.140
It's too soon.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.140
I mean, I can't. I...

21:39.180 --> 21:40.640
I can't.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.620
What, move on?

21:43.660 --> 21:45.240
You're not moving on.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.750
You never move on.

21:46.790 --> 21:49.150
Believe me.

21:49.190 --> 21:52.890
You're just trying to remember
what it feels like to be happy.

21:58.090 --> 22:02.770
I haven't kissed anyone else
in almost 20 years.

22:14.910 --> 22:18.110
[moans softly]

22:25.090 --> 22:28.520
When did you last talk
to your father?

22:32.530 --> 22:35.430
- Samira?
- What?

22:35.460 --> 22:37.430
What good will that do?

22:37.470 --> 22:40.840
My father is irrelevant to
what's going on in his home.

22:40.870 --> 22:43.300
Words don't matter
anymore.

22:43.340 --> 22:46.210
You didn't walk in here
with a pen.

22:51.140 --> 22:55.110
Her dad and I were
best friends.

22:55.150 --> 22:56.600
She was his pride
and joy.

22:56.630 --> 22:57.620
Knock it off.

22:57.650 --> 22:59.650
It's true.

22:59.690 --> 23:01.550
First in her class.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.420
[Daliyah] Really?

23:03.460 --> 23:07.830
I never made it past
the fifth grade.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.830
I had lots of school.

23:10.860 --> 23:14.000
Nearly 20 years of school.

23:14.030 --> 23:17.470
To be a lawyer.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.300
That's nice.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.510
Oh, yeah.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.060
It's a very optimistic thing,

23:22.100 --> 23:25.280
to spend so many years
in school.

23:25.310 --> 23:27.880
Preparing for the future.

23:27.910 --> 23:30.720
Still,

23:30.750 --> 23:33.300
I would have liked
the chance,

23:33.340 --> 23:34.850
believe me.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.890
Hmm.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.190
When I was 12,

23:43.230 --> 23:46.400
they picked eight of us...

23:46.430 --> 23:49.930
girls, all from Ma'an...

23:49.970 --> 23:54.800
to be...
a kind of model debate team.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.770
They showed us off,

23:58.810 --> 24:00.780
took us everywhere,

24:00.810 --> 24:03.150
even to Lebanon.

24:04.550 --> 24:06.980
We beat everyone.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.850
My friend Karima and I were
the best of all.

24:12.890 --> 24:15.370
Eight of us,

24:15.400 --> 24:16.960
just...

24:16.990 --> 24:22.000
[chuckles] going
through puberty.

24:22.030 --> 24:26.330
And the boys had no idea
what to make of us.

24:26.370 --> 24:29.570
They wanted to flirt,

24:29.600 --> 24:33.360
to slide by us too close

24:33.390 --> 24:36.820
and brush
against our breasts.

24:38.780 --> 24:42.520
But when we debated,

24:42.550 --> 24:45.950
they didn't know
what hit them.

24:48.220 --> 24:51.220
We were invincible.

24:53.630 --> 24:55.630
Ten years ago.

24:57.770 --> 24:59.770
[Samira sighs deeply]

24:59.770 --> 25:02.870
Ask me where
we all are now.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.980
Karima is dead.

25:08.910 --> 25:12.380
Gassed with
her entire family.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.280
Jadwah, too.

25:15.310 --> 25:17.020
Both dead.

25:17.050 --> 25:19.780
Two more have fled...

25:19.820 --> 25:22.450
somewhere... to some

25:22.490 --> 25:24.450
refugee camp

25:24.490 --> 25:27.220
where they can watch
their children...

25:27.260 --> 25:29.390
bloat...

25:29.430 --> 25:31.830
and starve.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.600
And then there's me.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.310
So... [exhales deeply]

25:43.310 --> 25:45.570
there it is.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.010
[clicks lips] My generation.

25:50.510 --> 25:51.980
Samira...

25:52.020 --> 25:53.180
[clears throat] What?

25:53.220 --> 25:56.050
I'm... long-winded.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.050
[Daliyah sniffles]

25:58.290 --> 26:00.590
[sighs heavily] You need to pee?

26:00.620 --> 26:02.390
Yes.

26:02.420 --> 26:03.890
May I?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.590
No.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.160
You can go in your pants.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.600
I'll go
in my pants.

26:12.630 --> 26:15.940
We can all go in our pants.

26:15.970 --> 26:19.440
You think it's degrading?

26:19.470 --> 26:22.660
Try being gassed.

26:22.690 --> 26:24.510
You shit
in your pants, too.

26:28.450 --> 26:31.250
There's nothing below us
anymore.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.290
[cell phone buzzes]

26:33.320 --> 26:34.620
You have a phone.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.290
Who is it?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.660
It'll be the guy
who's waiting for me

26:37.690 --> 26:39.490
downstairs standing guard.

26:39.530 --> 26:40.840
He will come up here

26:40.870 --> 26:42.530
to find out
what's taking so long

26:42.560 --> 26:44.230
unless I call him.

26:44.260 --> 26:46.530
Maybe.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.530
Or maybe it's not
and you just want

26:48.570 --> 26:50.000
the chance
to call for help.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.140
I promise you I won't.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.170
No, put the phone down.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.210
Put it down!

26:55.510 --> 26:56.640
[cell phone buzzes]

26:56.680 --> 26:58.340
Ignore it.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.690
Samira, I'm telling you...

27:00.720 --> 27:01.550
What?!

27:01.590 --> 27:03.210
The truth?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.450
Oh, you're on my side,
are you?

27:05.480 --> 27:07.890
Yes, sort of.

27:09.050 --> 27:11.720
No one's on my side.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.460
Throw me the phone.

27:14.460 --> 27:15.740
I'm going to
call my husband.

27:15.740 --> 27:16.560
There's no time for that.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.060
Give me the phone!

27:18.090 --> 27:19.200
Wait! Wait! Wait!

27:19.230 --> 27:20.800
[Daliyah screaming]
[gunshots]

27:20.830 --> 27:23.230
[Daliyah gasping]
[body thuds]

27:25.070 --> 27:27.770
Stay there!

27:32.080 --> 27:34.080
[breathing anxiously]

27:34.080 --> 27:36.050
We have to...

27:36.080 --> 27:38.180
He's dead.

27:38.180 --> 27:41.180
[Daliyah shivering]

27:41.180 --> 27:43.180
[sniffles]

27:44.720 --> 27:47.360
You ever kill
anyone before?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.960
[cell phone screen shattering]

28:02.960 --> 28:07.960
[footsteps approaching]

28:07.960 --> 28:09.760
What?

28:10.190 --> 28:11.750
Your wife is fine.

28:11.780 --> 28:14.250
[deep breath, exhales]

28:14.290 --> 28:17.840
The baby didn't make it.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.650
And we had to perform
a hysterectomy

28:22.680 --> 28:24.630
to stop the bleeding.

28:24.660 --> 28:27.030
No more children?

28:28.560 --> 28:32.140
Not that
she can carry, no.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.280
Thank you.

28:37.310 --> 28:39.440
Thank you
for taking care of her.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.450
May I see her?

28:41.480 --> 28:43.450
Not quite yet.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.560
She's still
very out of it.

28:46.590 --> 28:48.140
In recovery.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.860
I'll let you know.

28:51.890 --> 28:54.420
I'm sorry.

29:06.420 --> 29:08.420
[sobbing]

29:11.340 --> 29:13.550
[Mustafa] Hosni
would have said...

29:13.590 --> 29:15.400
we should have a big
feast in his honor.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.510
[chuckles]

29:16.550 --> 29:18.480
Lots of knafeh.

29:18.510 --> 29:21.680
That's how he got fat.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.090
Anyway...

29:24.120 --> 29:27.690
that's all, who cares?

29:27.720 --> 29:31.230
Food.

29:31.260 --> 29:33.730
Okay, uh,

29:33.760 --> 29:35.530
how about, uh...

29:35.560 --> 29:37.760
Abdul?

29:37.800 --> 29:40.230
Who would like
to say a few words?

29:45.210 --> 29:47.440
[man] I didn't know him
very well.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.840
Abdul.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.340
He was very shy.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.750
In the closet
for a long time, I think.

29:52.780 --> 29:56.770
Only recently he was able to
admit to us who he really was.

29:56.810 --> 29:58.080
I don't know.

29:58.110 --> 29:59.300
As I said...

29:59.330 --> 30:01.350
[Sammy] It was hard
for him.

30:03.290 --> 30:06.090
Uh, he had
a hard time

30:06.130 --> 30:08.790
not caring what other people
thought about him.

30:08.830 --> 30:12.230
But that's because he wanted
to be perceived a certain way.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.100
He...

30:13.130 --> 30:15.230
was determined...

30:15.270 --> 30:18.740
wanted to be important,
but he understood that that...

30:18.770 --> 30:21.310
wasn't gonna happen if...

30:21.340 --> 30:23.340
if he was gay.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.930
So he made a choice
that may seem weak,

30:28.970 --> 30:30.750
but he was...

30:30.780 --> 30:32.780
he was brave.

30:35.270 --> 30:38.390
I know he went to Ma'an
to get the job

30:38.420 --> 30:40.890
to make money
 to go to America.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.890
He said he could be
whatever he wanted there.

30:43.930 --> 30:47.730
He said, "America was
where his heart was."

30:51.940 --> 30:53.660
[Yaser breaths deeply] Uh...

30:53.690 --> 30:57.140
why don't we bow
our heads and, uh,

30:57.180 --> 30:58.870
let's remember them.

30:58.910 --> 31:02.040
[all] Arfan...

31:02.080 --> 31:04.610
Safar,

31:04.640 --> 31:07.210
Yasir Abbas,

31:07.250 --> 31:09.400
Hosni al-Fariq,

31:09.430 --> 31:11.430
Fikri Tammam,

31:11.470 --> 31:14.590
Abdul-Fattah al Mazen...

31:14.620 --> 31:15.820
[mourners continue reciting names]

31:15.860 --> 31:17.830
I need to talk to you.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.430
I can help you.

31:25.070 --> 31:27.540
What time
 is it? [sighs heavily]

31:27.570 --> 31:30.000
What?

31:30.040 --> 31:32.000
[sniffs, sighs]

31:32.040 --> 31:33.610
Uh...

31:33.640 --> 31:35.880
3:00 am.

31:35.910 --> 31:38.310
They'll be back soon.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.650
I doubt it.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.020
Ihab often comes back early
to read before he prays.

31:47.060 --> 31:49.590
What kind of prayer
 can you pray

31:49.620 --> 31:51.890
when he does
 the things he does?

31:51.920 --> 31:54.830
You'd have to ask him
 yourself.

31:54.860 --> 31:57.130
I don't speak for Ihab.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.170
What about you?

32:00.200 --> 32:03.670
Do you believe in
what the Caliphate is doing?

32:03.700 --> 32:06.200
What, the killing,
 you mean?

32:07.710 --> 32:09.310
No.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.780
[breaths deeply] But I don't give
 a shit anymore.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.320
I don't actually care...

32:21.350 --> 32:23.650
what they do [sighs]

32:23.690 --> 32:25.990
or what
 Abu Omar wants...

32:26.020 --> 32:28.160
or what he believes.

32:28.190 --> 32:30.990
I only care about
what he can give me.

32:31.030 --> 32:33.660
What is that?

32:33.700 --> 32:37.230
Revenge...

32:37.270 --> 32:40.770
for everything the Al Fayeeds
have taken from me.

32:43.010 --> 32:46.750
I used to think the world
is a very complicated place.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.480
But that's not true.

32:49.510 --> 32:52.010
[sniffles] You either

32:52.050 --> 32:55.780
win... or you lose.

32:55.820 --> 32:59.050
You're either human,

32:59.080 --> 33:01.920
or you're a dog.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.590
You're either
 inside the cage,

33:04.630 --> 33:06.790
or you're out.

33:06.830 --> 33:09.460
And I'm out right now,

33:09.500 --> 33:13.630
and I'm never,
<i>never</i> going back in.

33:13.670 --> 33:16.740
And I don't care

33:16.770 --> 33:20.340
if Abu Omar and his men
have to kill

33:20.370 --> 33:23.210
in order for me
 to stay here.

33:24.250 --> 33:28.350
I don't even care
if they have to kill you.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.220
I don't believe you.

33:34.820 --> 33:37.190
I know you, Samira.

33:37.220 --> 33:40.360
No.

33:40.390 --> 33:42.160
No.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.630
[sniffles] No.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.900
[clears her throat] Look...

33:45.930 --> 33:48.260
[sighs]

33:48.300 --> 33:50.770
You and I...

33:50.800 --> 33:53.670
we're both here, yes.

33:53.710 --> 33:56.510
But you're not
Bassam anymore,

33:56.510 --> 33:58.910
and I'm not Samira.

34:00.610 --> 34:02.310
[sniffles]

34:02.350 --> 34:04.550
Those people are dead.

34:04.580 --> 34:09.350
And the country they
lived in is gone.

34:09.389 --> 34:11.790
And this...

34:14.190 --> 34:16.590
This is what is left.

34:25.139 --> 34:27.270
[footsteps approaching]

34:37.770 --> 34:41.100
We should go home, get some
rest, come back in the morning.

34:41.139 --> 34:43.139
[sighs]

34:43.139 --> 34:45.639
Do you know why
I can't sleep?

34:46.870 --> 34:49.409
'Cause every time
I close my eyes,

34:49.449 --> 34:53.280
I see his face...
Bassam's face...

34:53.320 --> 34:56.790
with a sad smile,
saying to me,

34:56.820 --> 34:58.990
"I warned you.

34:59.020 --> 35:02.960
This is what happens when
a man wounds his own brother.

35:02.990 --> 35:05.330
He loses everything.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.740
His country,

35:07.780 --> 35:11.270
his grandson, himself."

35:11.300 --> 35:16.170
All this bad news,
blow after blow.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.870
One on the heels
 of the other.

35:18.910 --> 35:21.410
Haven't you wondered why?

35:21.440 --> 35:23.380
No.

35:23.410 --> 35:26.750
Things happen,
and we'll get through them.

35:26.780 --> 35:29.720
I don't think so.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.250
Something isn't right.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.460
Maybe it's punishment.

35:35.490 --> 35:37.990
You made difficult choices.

35:38.030 --> 35:41.300
That's what it means
to be a leader.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.760
This is...

35:46.100 --> 35:49.990
Time will pass, and
victories will come again.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.380
And what about Nusrat

35:51.410 --> 35:52.740
and our grandson?

35:52.770 --> 35:55.310
He should have been
a... a blessing.

35:55.340 --> 35:57.490
We're human.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.560
Sometimes we get sick,
and sometimes we die.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.350
It is nothing that you did.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.990
I wouldn't be so sure.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.800
Ma'an is an hour from here
as the crow flies.

36:22.830 --> 36:24.170
I'm sorry. I...

36:24.210 --> 36:25.930
Your reconnaissance flights.

36:25.970 --> 36:27.910
They must have returned
 by now.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.840
You have your
 bombing targets?

36:29.870 --> 36:31.740
I assume you're just asking
out of curiosity.

36:31.780 --> 36:33.340
I wouldn't assume that.

36:33.380 --> 36:36.450
We need more time
to analyze the data.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.150
You don't have more time.

36:38.180 --> 36:39.850
This country needs
a victory now.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.620
- I think you mean your husband.
- My husband is this country.

36:42.650 --> 36:45.360
If he fails, it fails.

36:45.390 --> 36:46.990
I'm telling you, I know him.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.910
You need to act now.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.190
The president and I will...

36:50.230 --> 36:52.630
The president is dealing
with family matters.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.030
I'm telling you.

36:58.230 --> 37:00.740
<i>I'm</i> telling you.

37:07.010 --> 37:11.860
So, I have a friend, Halima,
who was imprisoned

37:11.900 --> 37:15.080
in Ma'an for speaking out
against the Caliphate.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.150
She says that there's
a growing insurgency

37:18.190 --> 37:19.490
called the Red Hand.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.660
They're doing
amazing things.

37:21.660 --> 37:22.860
And they have a leader,
 Khalil,

37:22.890 --> 37:24.920
- who isn't afraid to...
- Why are you telling me this?

37:26.160 --> 37:29.430
Yaser told me
 what you offered.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.170
They need money.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.750
No. I... I know.
I know. I know

37:34.790 --> 37:38.010
it wouldn't save your friend,

37:38.040 --> 37:42.280
but it would punish the people
who did this to him.

37:42.310 --> 37:45.540
I'm not a political person,
all right?

37:45.880 --> 37:47.820
I have a pretty
 good reason

37:47.860 --> 37:50.680
to hate every side
in this country.

37:50.720 --> 37:54.380
And, anyways, I'm not looking
to invest my money.

37:54.420 --> 37:55.950
This was just personal.

37:55.990 --> 37:59.350
So I'm sorry,
 but I... I got to go.

38:00.350 --> 38:04.350
[low hum of chat]

38:06.830 --> 38:08.830
[shouting, screaming]

38:11.370 --> 38:14.140
[sniffles]

38:14.170 --> 38:16.140
[groans]

38:16.170 --> 38:18.680
[panting]

38:18.710 --> 38:22.850
Hosni was a cousin.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.780
It's personal
for me, too.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.920
Stopping
these people.

38:36.950 --> 38:38.690
4:30.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.460
Don't ask again.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.970
Samira?

38:44.010 --> 38:45.550
- What?
- Why can't we help

38:45.580 --> 38:47.200
each other?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.980
We're both stuck, right?

38:48.980 --> 38:51.010
Which is crazy,
because we want the same thing.

38:51.010 --> 38:52.280
We both want
 the same country.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.840
You can't help me!

38:53.880 --> 38:56.680
Why don't you try?

38:56.710 --> 38:59.180
Because he's still
an Al Fayeed.

38:59.220 --> 39:01.180
And if you win this war,

39:01.220 --> 39:04.810
whatever noble intentions
you might have,

39:04.850 --> 39:07.340
your brother wins, too.

39:07.380 --> 39:08.860
And I lose.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.000
It's more complicated.

39:10.030 --> 39:12.260
No. Mm-mm.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.160
We're enemies now.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.950
And, anyway,

39:18.980 --> 39:20.990
it's too late.

39:27.170 --> 39:28.910
- What are you doing?
- I told you,

39:28.940 --> 39:31.880
I won't be captured.
You can kill me or let me go.

39:31.910 --> 39:32.650
Stand up.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.250
No, Bassam,
 don't be stupid.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.900
Don't give me a reason to kill you.
I don't want to do that.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.170
- Listen to me. Stay behind me.
- I can't let you leave.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.190
- [Barry] This will show you where to go.
- Bassam!

39:40.220 --> 39:41.820
You said it yourself,
it's too late.

39:41.860 --> 39:44.390
- Start walking. Start walking.
- No. Don't test me. I'm not

39:44.420 --> 39:46.240
your best friend's little girl
anymore.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.910
Please!
 I'm warning you! Stop!

39:48.940 --> 39:50.860
[gunshot]
[Bassam shouts]

39:50.890 --> 39:53.170
I warned you.
 I'll kill her.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.870
I... [grunts]

39:54.900 --> 39:55.770
Oh, my... 
Oh, my God.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.040
Oh, my God.

39:57.070 --> 39:59.040
Oh, my God.

39:59.070 --> 40:00.600
[Samira panting]

40:00.640 --> 40:02.770
[Daliyah] Oh, my God.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.810
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.210
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Let me help you.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.210
- [Samira panting]
- [Daliyah] Let me help you.

40:10.210 --> 40:12.870
- [Samira panting]
- Let me... Let me help you.

40:12.910 --> 40:17.490
[moaning]

40:20.930 --> 40:24.930
[panting and sobbing]

40:24.930 --> 40:26.600
- We have to take her with us.
- [Samira moaning]

40:26.600 --> 40:29.010
- Find a, uh... a... a curtain or a sheet
- [Samira monaning]

40:29.040 --> 40:32.040
or something I can wrap her
with. Hurry!

40:32.080 --> 40:34.650
You can't take her with us.
It'll be light

40:34.680 --> 40:37.440
in 20 minutes.
You can't carry

40:37.470 --> 40:40.070
a dying woman
through the streets of Ma'an,

40:40.110 --> 40:42.550
- with Caliphate soldiers...
- I'll figure it out.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.370
- How? Expl...
- I'll figure it out!

40:46.550 --> 40:48.280
- Come on.
- [Samira shouts]

40:48.320 --> 40:51.990
[crying]

40:52.020 --> 40:54.660
And do you have blood
to replace hers?

40:54.690 --> 40:56.220
Or antibiotics

40:56.260 --> 40:58.890
or clean needles and thread?
Can you actually

40:58.920 --> 41:00.060
save her?

41:00.100 --> 41:03.330
Or are you trying
to save yourself?

41:03.370 --> 41:05.270
[crying softly]

41:05.300 --> 41:07.300
[Bassam sighs]

41:07.340 --> 41:09.740
[shuddering breaths]

41:13.740 --> 41:16.080
I'm sorry.

41:17.150 --> 41:20.150
I can't fix this.

41:20.150 --> 41:22.880
[Samira shivering]

41:22.880 --> 41:24.850
I can't stay.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.950
But I'm not gonna leave
like this.

41:28.990 --> 41:31.790
Listen to me,

41:31.820 --> 41:34.690
Samira,

41:34.730 --> 41:39.590
your father
loves you so much.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.770
He loves you
so much.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.410
I'm gonna
make this

41:47.440 --> 41:51.120
the place you and your friend
dreamed of when you were 12.

41:51.150 --> 41:53.250
I promise you.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.240
[sniffles] I promise you.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.290
For other girls,
not for you.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.990
[Samira gasps]

42:06.020 --> 42:08.990
[shuddering inhale, exhales]

42:09.030 --> 42:12.030
[Bassam crying]

42:15.800 --> 42:17.530
[voice breaking] No more pain.

42:17.570 --> 42:21.300
No more pain.
No more pain.

42:23.310 --> 42:27.740
[sobbing]

42:30.380 --> 42:32.750
[Daliyah] Bassam?

42:32.780 --> 42:34.750
Bassam.

42:34.780 --> 42:37.750
We have to go.

42:44.650 --> 42:46.970
[crying]

42:52.090 --> 42:54.090
[sobbing]

42:54.090 --> 42:56.660
[screams]

42:56.700 --> 42:59.720
[steady beeping]

43:03.170 --> 43:05.040
Hey, you.

43:08.170 --> 43:10.170
[exhales deeply]

43:10.170 --> 43:13.600
I know.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.610
I know about our baby.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.640
The doctor,

43:18.680 --> 43:20.640
she told me.

43:20.670 --> 43:23.350
It's okay. It's okay.

43:23.380 --> 43:26.520
We'll talk
 about it later.

43:26.550 --> 43:29.150
I'm sorry.

43:29.190 --> 43:32.420
What are you
 sorry about?

43:32.460 --> 43:36.530
You don't have to apologize.
It's not your fault.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.530
If anything,

43:38.560 --> 43:40.910
I should apologize
for asking you to come

43:40.950 --> 43:43.500
to the ceremony.

43:43.530 --> 43:46.340
I love you.

43:46.370 --> 43:48.480
And you're here.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.370
And that's all
 that matters.

43:56.410 --> 43:59.480
The baby was
 keeping me alive.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.650
What?

44:01.680 --> 44:04.090
The baby...

44:04.120 --> 44:08.760
was keeping me alive.

44:08.790 --> 44:11.330
I don't know
 what that means.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.060
- No. No.
- Shh.

44:13.090 --> 44:14.060
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

44:14.100 --> 44:15.600
- Please. I...
- Shh.

44:15.630 --> 44:19.050
Shh, shh, shh.
You're sleepy.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.370
You need
to rest.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.840
We'll talk about it later.

44:25.510 --> 44:26.870
[Rami]You heard me
 right.

44:26.910 --> 44:27.940
When?

44:27.980 --> 44:29.540
Now. Dawn.

44:29.580 --> 44:31.710
You want to give us
 our targets.

44:31.750 --> 44:33.830
We have not had time
to fully analyze

44:33.870 --> 44:36.120
- the reconnaissance data yet.
- The outskirts of the city.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.880
Somewhere where you're sure
no one is.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.850
[chuckles] Genius.

44:40.890 --> 44:42.510
I don't care if we don't kill a
single member of the Caliphate.

44:42.540 --> 44:45.020
I do not want reports of civilian deaths,
do you understand?

44:45.020 --> 44:46.750
We'll claim victory
whether it is one or not.

44:46.790 --> 44:47.830
That's...

44:47.860 --> 44:49.660
Well... [sighs]

44:49.700 --> 44:51.160
it's insane.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.400
Yeah. [chuckles]

44:52.430 --> 44:55.300
The inmates
are loose around here.

45:00.270 --> 45:02.240
[scoffs] I'm sorry.

45:02.270 --> 45:06.110
If that was...
too cruel.

45:06.110 --> 45:08.820
Listen, they're, uh...
they're closing up,

45:08.850 --> 45:10.480
so we have to get going.

45:10.510 --> 45:12.420
I'm not an idiot.

45:12.450 --> 45:14.050
All right?

45:14.090 --> 45:17.390
I'm not gonna just give
my money to some stranger

45:17.420 --> 45:19.890
on the promise
that he's gonna deliver it

45:19.920 --> 45:22.210
to some
 mysterious insurgency

45:22.240 --> 45:24.630
just 'cause
 he asks for it.

45:24.660 --> 45:25.900
Right.

45:25.930 --> 45:27.560
Right. Okay.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.230
Fair enough.

45:30.270 --> 45:32.230
What do you want?

45:32.270 --> 45:36.240
If the insurgency
 needs money,

45:36.270 --> 45:39.180
you take me to them

45:39.210 --> 45:42.980
and let them tell me that
themselves.

45:43.010 --> 45:45.460
Go to Ma'an? No.

45:45.490 --> 45:47.920
[scoffing] No.
 Too dangerous.

45:47.950 --> 45:50.250
Fine.

45:50.290 --> 45:52.650
I'm going home.

45:54.390 --> 45:55.690
Okay.

45:57.530 --> 45:59.930
[scoffs] Okay.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.030
I'll get you there.

46:04.300 --> 46:06.060
Shit.

46:31.460 --> 46:33.460
[indistinct conversation]

46:33.460 --> 46:36.630
I won't post anything
about what happened,

46:36.660 --> 46:40.800
out of respect
for the woman who died.

46:40.830 --> 46:44.170
I'm glad you're both back safe,
though. We were really worried.

46:47.780 --> 46:49.780
[Daliyah sniffles]

46:49.780 --> 46:51.740
I'm sorry.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.410
[crying softly]

46:53.450 --> 46:54.910
Daliyah.

46:54.950 --> 46:57.760
What? I'm okay.

46:59.380 --> 47:02.050
You're in mourning, too.
Don't worry about me.

47:02.090 --> 47:04.420
[sniffles]

47:04.460 --> 47:07.860
I do worry about you.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.070
Ahmos was
a very special man.

47:17.100 --> 47:20.900
It took us
 some time, but...

47:20.940 --> 47:25.810
we both came
to trust each other.

47:25.850 --> 47:29.750
He loved you
and Ghani.

47:34.680 --> 47:38.460
I didn't love him
when I married him.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.950
But you can come
to love a person

47:41.990 --> 47:43.690
just because
 they're good.

47:46.630 --> 47:49.420
I'm just very sad
 right now.

47:50.670 --> 47:53.630
I'm very, very...

47:53.670 --> 47:56.470
very sad.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.440
For everyone.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.480
I didn't have any choice.

48:06.510 --> 48:09.180
I know.

48:13.180 --> 48:17.180
[crying softly]

48:17.180 --> 48:19.730
[rocket whistles]

48:19.730 --> 48:22.680
[explosion, people shouting]
What's happening?

48:22.720 --> 48:25.140
- Who is attacking us?
- I don't know, I don't know.

48:25.140 --> 48:28.000

[Daliyah gasping]

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
[people shouting continues]

48:30.070 --> 48:32.530
It's okay.
It's okay.

48:32.570 --> 48:35.040
I'm gonna protect you.
I'm gonna protect you.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.090
[booming]

48:37.120 --> 48:39.420
[reporter] ...bombing relief efforts.
The UN says

48:39.450 --> 48:42.260
it's a full-blown
humanitarian crisis,

48:42.300 --> 48:43.840
while in neighboring
 Abuddin,

48:43.840 --> 48:45.450
air strikes
 by government forces

48:45.480 --> 48:48.470
began today in the campaign
to take back Ma'an City

48:48.510 --> 48:49.590
from the Caliphate.

48:49.620 --> 48:51.570
The enemy suffered
substantial losses,

48:51.600 --> 48:55.210
and President Al Fayeed,
who is in mourning, said,

48:55.240 --> 48:58.250
Today we start a fight
for freedom, the end of which

48:58.290 --> 49:00.000
my grandson will not see,

49:00.030 --> 49:01.890
but it is for all the children

49:01.920 --> 49:04.030
and grandchildren
 of Abuddin."

You see?

49:06.340 --> 49:09.450
Good news.
