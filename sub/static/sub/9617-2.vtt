WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:05.804
Maya:
HOW LONG ARE WE
AVOIDING THIS?

00:05.806 --> 00:07.172
Riley:
NOT AVOIDING
NOTHING.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.024
JUST LIFE
MOVING ON BEYOND

00:09.025 --> 00:10.875
THAT THING THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND LUCAS.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.945
(kissing noises)

00:12.947 --> 00:15.881
I KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
FISH-FACE AT ME.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.550
(kissing noises continue)

00:20.454 --> 00:22.621
MAYA, OTHER THINGS
ARE HAPPENING.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.590
LIFE GOT OVER IT.
WHY CAN'T YOU?

00:24.592 --> 00:26.859
LIFE ISN'T OVER IT.
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED
EVERYTHING STOPPED?

00:26.861 --> 00:27.893
NOTHING IS
HAPPENING.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.628
EVERYTHING'S
HAPPENING!

00:34.468 --> 00:36.201
RILEY, UNTIL
WE TALK ABOUT

00:36.203 --> 00:37.803
(kissing noise),
NOTHING'S EVER
HAPPENING AGAIN.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.205
OH, THAT'S THE
TALK OF A KOOK.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.679
(sighs)

00:49.683 --> 00:50.949
LADIES.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.485
YAY!

00:53.487 --> 00:54.620
WELL THAT'S
SETTLED THEN.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.555
ARE YOU HERE FOR
A REASON, FARKLE?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.424
I'VE GOT TWO
TICKETS TO A CONCERT

00:58.426 --> 00:59.825
BUT THERE'S
THREE OF US.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.794
SO WHO DO I TAKE?

01:03.297 --> 01:04.663
YOU SEE, THAT
RIGHT THERE

01:04.665 --> 01:07.266
IS A VERY
ORIGINAL
SITUATION.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.901
THERE WILL BE MANY
TWISTS AND TURNS

01:08.903 --> 01:10.636
THAT NO ONE
WILL SEE COMING.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.272
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU HUGGED ME, RILEY.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.006
I'M TAKING YOU.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.410
I DID NOT SEE
THAT COMING.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.511
SO WE'RE BACK.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.246
SUBWAY CAR,
YOU LOCK EYES,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.282
YOU FALL INTO HIS LAP,
YOU GRAB LUCAS BY THE FACE.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.416
YOU START MOVING
TOWARD HIM AND--

01:24.418 --> 01:25.951
-RILEY!
-YAY!

01:25.953 --> 01:27.636
DID I DO
SOMETHING?

01:27.637 --> 01:29.320
AM I GROUNDED?
DOES SHE HAVE
TO LEAVE?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.256
YOU HAVE
TO LEAVE.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.341
NO WE'RE GLAD
YOU'RE BOTH HERE.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.425
WE NEED YOU
TO BABYSIT AUGGIE.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.727
THEY NEED US
TO BABYSIT AUGGIE.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.762
BEEN THERE
DONE THAT.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.731
THINGS COULD
HAPPEN TWICE.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.867
UNLESS IT'S AN
EMERGENCY, WE
DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.936
WHAT COULD HAPPEN?
I'LL TELL YA.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.638
WE'LL PUT
TOO MUCH SOAP
IN THE WASHING MACHINE,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.707
AND THEN WE'LL
FIND A PUPPY AND SAY,

01:48.709 --> 01:49.775
"CAN WE
KEEP HIM?"

01:49.777 --> 01:51.477
AND THEN HIS
OWNER WILL SHOW UP.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.279
IT WILL BE
THIS HOT GUY THAT
MAYA WILL TOTALLY LIKE.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.547
YAY!

01:56.784 --> 01:58.050
BUT THEN HE
WILL MOVE AWAY

01:58.052 --> 01:59.885
BECAUSE MAYA CAN
NEVER BE HAPPY.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.353
BOO!

02:02.089 --> 02:04.590
YOU SEE, WE HAVE
A LOT GOING ON TODAY.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.624
TOMORROW.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.792
HUH?

02:06.794 --> 02:09.027
YEAH, WE NEED
YOU TO BABYSIT
TOMORROW.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.429
TODAY WE
GOT NOTHING.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.033
SO, YOU GOT
LUCAS BY THE FACE AND...

02:15.035 --> 02:16.735
HELP ME!

02:16.737 --> 02:19.605
YAY! AUGGIE,
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS

02:19.607 --> 02:21.340
THAT I CAN
HELP YOU WITH?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.809
WELL, I MADE
A NEW FRIEND
AT SCHOOL

02:23.811 --> 02:25.511
WHAT IF MOM
DOESN'T LIKE HIM?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.713
WHAT IF SHE PICKS
HIM UP AND PUTS
HIM IN THE HALLWAY?

02:27.715 --> 02:30.015
LIKE AVA!

02:30.016 --> 02:32.316
WHAT IF NO ONE IS
EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR
MOMMY'S LITTLE BOY?

02:34.388 --> 02:35.787
THIS IS A THING.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.991
EH, NOT A WHOLE THING.
WE CHECK BACK ON THIS
TWICE TOPS.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.627
I WOULD BE
INVOLVED IN IT.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.362
COMPLETELY YOUR
MOTHER'S THING.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.465
YEAH, SCRAM.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.601
MOM?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.910
SO THAT'S EVERYBODY
WE KNOW, HUH?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.444
NOT QUITE, YOU
GOT ONE MORE FRIEND

02:59.446 --> 03:01.013
THAT HAS A PROBLEM
YOU COULD GET INVOLVED IN.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.648
I DO? WHO?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.350
OH YEAH.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.386
MY TROUBLED,
MISUNDERSTOOD FRIEND.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.887
PEOPLE LOVE
YOUR PROBLEMS.

03:08.889 --> 03:09.988
YOU'RE A MESS!

03:12.393 --> 03:13.592
THANKS.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.093
MY PROBLEM IS THAT
I HAVE A BEST FRIEND

03:15.095 --> 03:16.478
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT

03:16.479 --> 03:17.862
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING GOING ON
IN HER LIFE,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.765
AND I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.099
CAN YOU HELP
ME PLEASE?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.371
I KISSED LUCAS.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.006
YOU DON'T SAY?

03:29.510 --> 03:31.510
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.072
IN A CERTAIN PLACE

04:34.074 --> 04:36.174
TRAVEL TO A NEW LAND

04:36.176 --> 04:37.209
OF NEW FEELINGS

04:37.211 --> 04:39.444
AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.715
HAVING NO IDEA HOW TO BEHAVE
IN THIS BRAND NEW SOCIETY.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.450
LUCAS, WHAT DID
YOU TELL HIM?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.519
NOTHING, I AM
ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.224
-WAIT, MR. MATTHEWS DOESN'T
KNOW RILEY KISSED LUCAS?
-NO.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.226
SO EVERYTHING HE
SAYS IS MAKING
THEM UNCOMFORTABLE?

04:54.228 --> 04:55.460
UH-HUH.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.228
SHALL WE TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS?

04:56.230 --> 04:57.562
HOW COULD WE NOT?

04:57.564 --> 04:58.864
I WILL BEGIN.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.932
SO, MR. MATTHEWS,
TELL ME,

05:00.934 --> 05:02.167
AFTER YOU'VE HAD
THE COURAGE

05:02.169 --> 05:03.268
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES

05:03.270 --> 05:04.603
AND TAKE THE FACE OF
THE NEW WORLD

05:04.605 --> 05:06.505
IN YOUR TREMBLING HANDS...

05:06.507 --> 05:07.906
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY, FARKLE?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.474
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
A COUPLE NEXT?

05:09.476 --> 05:10.509
-OR WHAT?
-HUH?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.110
-WHAT?
-HUH?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.912
OH, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MY QUESTION?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.013
PERHAPS MY DEAR FRIEND

05:15.015 --> 05:16.048
MISS MAYA PENELOPE HART

05:16.050 --> 05:17.683
COULD HELP ME OUT.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.485
PENELOPE.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.304
FARKLE...

05:22.305 --> 05:24.122
IT CAME OUT. IT JUST CAME OUT.
IT CAME OUT. IT JUST CAME OUT.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.674
PENELOPE?

05:25.675 --> 05:27.225
REALLY, HUCKLEBERRY?
YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME RIGHT NOW?

05:27.227 --> 05:30.562
-NO.
-'CAUSE YOU'VE DONE QUITE
ENOUGH, HAVEN'T YOU?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.165
MAYA!

05:33.167 --> 05:34.232
MAYA!

05:34.234 --> 05:35.534
MR. MATTHEWS,

05:35.536 --> 05:37.269
I THINK WHAT FARKLE
IS TRYING TO SAY

05:37.271 --> 05:39.004
IS ONCE YOU'VE KISSED...

05:39.006 --> 05:40.072
YEEP!

05:40.074 --> 05:42.007
...THE SHORES
OF THIS NEW WORLD

05:42.009 --> 05:43.608
I BET YOUR FRIENDS
FROM THE OLD WORLD

05:43.610 --> 05:45.243
WOULD WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT HOW
THE NEW WORLD IS,

05:45.245 --> 05:47.579
AND IF YOU DON'T
TELL THEM, WELL
THAT'S JUST SELFISH.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.148
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, PENELOPE?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.551
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
A COUPLE NEXT, OR WHAT?

05:52.553 --> 05:54.720
ALRIGHT, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, GUYS?

05:54.722 --> 05:58.523
NOTHING! COULD WE
JUST PLEASE, FOR ONCE,
READ FROM THE BOOK?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.225
"THE BOY AND
THE GIRL HAD NO IDEA

06:00.227 --> 06:02.194
"OF THE CHANGES
THEY WOULD SOON
BE FACING.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.729
"EVERYTHING WAS
DIFFERENT

06:03.731 --> 06:05.997
"INCLUDING THEIR
OWN BODIES..."
WHAT THE...

06:07.301 --> 06:08.967
YOU'RE READING
YOUR HEALTH BOOK.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.769
WORD OF WARNING
PAGE 73.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.570
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
IT LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.308
RILEY, WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.243
FARKLE KISSED MY HAND.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.711
-YOU DID?
-IT WAS GLORIOUS.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.614
IT WAS. I WENT HOME AND
QUESTIONED EVERYTHING.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.883
OKAY, AND WHERE
WERE YOU WHILE
ALL OF THIS

06:24.885 --> 06:26.318
HAND KISSING
WAS GOING ON?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.719
NOWHERE,
WITH NO ONE

06:27.721 --> 06:29.588
DOIN' NOTHING
WITH NOBODY.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.172
AUGGIE NOW.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.141
I DON'T SEE WHERE
ELSE WE CAN GO.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.918
SORRY I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO BUY YOU SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU CAME OVER.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.220
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
BUY ME SOMETHING.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.855
WHY ELSE WOULD
YOU COME OVER?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.057
I CAME TO PLAY
WITH YOU.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.192
AUGGIE

07:07.194 --> 07:08.727
WHO IS YOUR NICE,
NORMAL FRIEND

07:08.729 --> 07:10.328
WHO ISN'T AVA AND
DOESN'T NEED GIFTS

07:10.330 --> 07:11.596
TO COME OVER
AND PLAY WITH YOU?

07:11.598 --> 07:12.764
DOY!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.266
EXCUSE ME?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.802
LEAVE IT ALONE, MOM.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.721
OKAY, WAIT A
MINUTE THOUGH

07:19.722 --> 07:21.238
YOUR NAME AGAIN,
WILL YOU JUST SPELL
THAT FOR ME?

07:21.241 --> 07:24.142
D-E-W-E-Y, DOY.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.979
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.714
THE "W" IS SILENT.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.684
LET IT BE SILENT.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.085
HE'S MY FIRST BRO.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.089
OKAY, BUT SEE, HONEY,

07:38.091 --> 07:39.658
THE "W" IS ACTUALLY

07:39.660 --> 07:40.992
NOT SILENT.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.060
NO!

07:42.062 --> 07:43.094
YES.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.629
DOY!

07:44.631 --> 07:46.698
LET HIM BE RIGHT, MOM

07:47.634 --> 07:49.134
EXCEPT, HE'S
NOT RIGHT.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.369
NO, SEE, HIS NAME
IS NOT "DOY"

07:51.371 --> 07:53.205
NO, IT'S "DEWEY."

07:53.207 --> 07:55.240
WITH A "W"
THAT YOU SAY.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.676
(sobbing)

07:57.678 --> 07:59.077
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.146
(crying)

08:01.148 --> 08:02.781
(screaming)

08:08.255 --> 08:09.821
YOU RUINED
MY PLAYDATE.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.791
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY, DEWEY.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.860
DOY!

08:16.730 --> 08:18.396
WHAT THE--
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO DOY?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.199
ARE YOU KIDDING
ME, CORY?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.902
IT'S "COY".
AROUND HIM,
IT'S "COY".

08:25.072 --> 08:26.705
COME TO COY, DOY!

08:29.276 --> 08:30.942
CAN WE GO TO
AUGGIE'S ROOM?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.078
YES, I'LL GO AND
READ YOU A STOY.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.428
EVERYBODY STOP
LOOKING AT ME.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.964
-TELL US.
-I DON'T KISS AND TELL.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.199
-DID YOU KISS?
-YES.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.201
-TELL.
-AND TAKE YOUR TIME.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.205
NOTHING HAPPENED.
BACK ME UP, MAYA.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.477
THAT'S INACCURATE.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.413
(kissing noises)

09:09.750 --> 09:10.949
YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY GOOD.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.486
SO, WHAT'S THE
NEXT THING YOU GUYS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO?

09:14.488 --> 09:16.755
SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT ARE THERE? RULES?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.890
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW
YOU CAN JUST KISS SOMEONE

09:18.892 --> 09:20.091
AND NOT BE WITH
THEM AFTER.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.259
I ONLY KISSED
MAYA'S HAND,

09:21.261 --> 09:22.727
AND THEN I GOT HER
THIS ENGAGEMENT RING

09:22.729 --> 09:23.962
RIGHT AFTER WE GOT
OFF THE SUBWAY.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.832
OH MY GOSH, FARKLE,
HOW MUCH WAS THAT?

09:27.834 --> 09:29.401
$78,000.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.069
-BUT, I GOT IT FOR FREE.
-HOW?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.805
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RING
MY MOM KEEPS THROWING
AT MY FATHER.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.142
SHE USUALLY WANTS
IT BACK BY THURSDAY.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.476
SO I GOT TO
WORK FAST.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.479
SO ARE YOU GUYS
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND NOW?

09:41.481 --> 09:43.148
-WHAT ARE YOU?
-WHAT ARE YOU?

09:43.149 --> 09:44.816
I DON'T KNOW.
DO WE HAVE TO BE
SOMETHING?

09:44.818 --> 09:45.884
WELL YOU DID
KISS HIM.

09:45.886 --> 09:46.918
WHAT ARE YA?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.386
LOOK, IT JUST
HAPPENED.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.322
SHE'S NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT IT ALL MEANS YET.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.023
YOU GUYS ARE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.325
LIKE ME AND YOGI!

09:53.327 --> 09:54.893
YOGLES!

09:56.997 --> 09:59.230
WILL LUCAS AND I
EVER HAVE WHAT
THEY HAVE?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.398
BOY, I HOPE NOT.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.402
BUT YOU KNOW, RILES,
THEY DO HAVE A POINT.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.437
I MEAN, YOU LIKE HIM.
HE LIKES YOU. THERE
WAS A KISS.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.540
I WILL NOT ACT
UNDER PEER PRESSURE.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.008
UNLESS YOU THINK
I SHOULD.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.812
I WILL NOT GIVE
INTO PEER PRESSURE.

10:13.814 --> 10:14.813
WHAT IF WE
CARRY YOU?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.081
I'D LIKE TO
SEE YOU TRY.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.215
DARBY.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.152
HEY, STOP.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.455
WHAT ARE YOU?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.857
WHAT ARE WE?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.525
ARE WE BOYFRIEND
AND GIRLFRIEND?

10:27.527 --> 10:29.861
ARE WE?

10:29.863 --> 10:30.929
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU WANNA?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.399
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU THINK, MAYBE?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.068
WANNA?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.504
ARE THEY WEIRD,
OR ADORABLE?

10:39.506 --> 10:40.538
NO.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.008
ME AND YOGI ARE WEIRD.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.909
THEY'RE ADORABLE.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.878
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.813
DO I HAVE MY
FIRST BOYFRIEND?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.316
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

10:51.318 --> 10:55.053
I DON'T KNOW.
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.469
OKAY, HERE WE ARE.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.371
WHAT DO WE
DO NOW?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.373
YOU GO ON A
DATE AFTER SCHOOL.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.876
YOU SIT THERE AND
LOOK AT EACH OTHER
ALL STUPID.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.477
LIKE THIS.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.883
STOP. NOBODY'S
TELLING US WHAT TO DO.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.885
WE'RE NOT YOU.
YOU'RE YOU.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.220
WE'RE US. WE DO
WHAT WE DO.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.923
YEAH, WE DO
WHAT WE DO.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.025
WHAT DO WE DO?

11:46.440 --> 11:49.074
WHAT IS IT IN YOU
THAT MAKES YOU DO THIS?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.642
HIS NAME IS DEWEY.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.011
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHAT HIS NAME IS?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.579
HE SAYS HIS
NAME IS "DOY,"

11:54.581 --> 11:56.414
AND HE WANTS TO
BE CALLED "DOY,"

11:56.415 --> 11:58.248
SO WE CALL HIM "DOY"
BECAUSE HE SAYS HIS
NAME IS "DOY."

11:58.251 --> 12:00.185
AND DOY IS A GUEST
IN OUR HOUSE.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.687
SO WILL YOU PLEASE LET GO
OF YOUR NEED TO BE
RIGHT ALL THE TIME,

12:02.689 --> 12:04.622
AND WE JUST CALL
THE KID "DOY"?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.424
DOY?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.129
CAN I PLEASE TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

12:12.666 --> 12:14.933
I WOULDN'T.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.334
I WOULDN'T EITHER.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.070
COME HERE.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.441
COME ON.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.646
COME ON.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.253
AH!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.588
OKAY.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.957
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN NEXT.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.202
ONE SMOOTHIE,
TWO STRAWS.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.272
YOU TWO NEW
AT THIS?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.707
DON'T WORRY,
IT GETS HARDER.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.700
WE'RE JUST
SITTING HERE.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.718
YEAH, WE HAVEN'T
TALKED TO EACH OTHER
MUCH AT ALL.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.723
IT'S TOO BAD,
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
MY FAVORITE PEOPLE TO TALK TO.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.663
I THINK YOUR MOM
DID A REALLY GOOD
JOB ON THIS PLACE.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.300
YEAH, GOING TO BE
A GREAT HANG OUT,
ISN'T IT?

13:22.302 --> 13:25.436
YEAH, LOOK AT ALL
THESE NYU STUDENTS.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.704
SMILING...

13:26.706 --> 13:27.739
TALKING...

13:27.741 --> 13:28.973
LOOKING REAL...

13:28.975 --> 13:30.675
COMFORTABLE WITH
EACH OTHER, YEAH.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.564
YEAH.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.015
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT'S SO HARD FOR US
TO TALK ALL OF A SUDDEN.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.516
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'VE CHANGED.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.752
WE'RE BOYFRIEND
AND GIRLFRIEND NOW.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.720
YEAH BUT THOSE ARE
JUST WORDS, RILEY.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.022
WORDS DON'T
CHANGE PEOPLE.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.260
MRS. FARKLE MINKUS.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.231
YOU SAID YES?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.033
GOOD-BYE MAYA
PENELOPE HART,

13:55.035 --> 13:57.068
HELLO, MRS.
FARKLE MINKUS.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.070
ALL THIS TIME, I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO LOVE
AND APPRECIATE HER,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.672
BUT ALL IT TOOK
WAS THIS BIG,
HUNKING ROCK.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.741
MAKE A NOTE, RILEY.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.109
THEY PUT ONE OF THESE
IN FRONT OF OUR FACE,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.611
AND WE GET
HYPNOTIZED BY
THE SPARKLES.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.213
WAIT, YOU ONLY
SAID YES BECAUSE
OF THE RING?

14:08.215 --> 14:09.815
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME?

14:09.816 --> 14:11.416
THAT WOULD BE
PRETTY SHALLOW
OF ME, WOULDN'T IT?

14:11.418 --> 14:12.684
I DON'T CARE.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.521
ALL RIGHT, FARKLE,
YOU'RE A SCIENTIST,

14:16.523 --> 14:17.622
LET'S DO AN
EXPERIMENT.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.756
ASK ME WITHOUT
THE RING.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.791
WOULD YOU
MARRY ME?

14:19.793 --> 14:21.593
DIE. NOW ASK
ME WITH THE RING.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.061
WOULD YOU
MARRY ME?

14:23.797 --> 14:25.396
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.065
I BELIEVE YOU.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.667
HYPNOTIZED, RILEY.
YOU NEED TO PROTECT ME.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.369
PROTECT YOU
FROM WHAT, MAYA?

14:31.371 --> 14:34.038
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT TWO PEOPLE

14:34.040 --> 14:36.541
WHO MAKE THE CHOICE
TO COME TOGETHER
BY THEMSELVES.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.142
OF THEIR OWN
FREE WILL

14:38.144 --> 14:39.544
AT THE RIGHT
POINT IN TIME.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.379
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH--

14:42.582 --> 14:45.049
HOW DO THEY GET
THESE THINGS SO
SPARKLY, FARKLEY?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.252
PRESSURE.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.120
THIS DIAMOND USED
TO JUST BE A
PIECE OF COAL

14:49.122 --> 14:50.221
THAT WAS PUT UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.522
YEAH, I'M KEEPING IT.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.790
GOOD. I COME
WITH IT.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.126
HUH, WELL,
I REALLY LOVE YOU
AND EVERYTHING.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.594
-WHY, THANK YOU.
-I WAS TALKING TO THE RING.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.346
OH.

14:58.347 --> 15:00.097
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THE ONLY WAY WE COULD BE HAPPY

15:00.100 --> 15:01.699
IS IF I SELL YOU,
GET A NICE HOUSE

15:01.701 --> 15:03.534
AND THE TWO OF US
WOULD JUST BE HAPPY
WITH EACH OTHER.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.802
-JUST ME AND YOU?
-JUST ME AND THE RING.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.504
-WAIT YOU'RE SELLING ME?
-I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLEAR?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.439
FINE. COME ON LUCAS,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.774
OH, WELL I WAS GOING
TO WALK RILEY HOME.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.076
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.444
NO, I THINK
I SHOULD.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.479
TRY AGAIN.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.847
I WANT TO
VERY MUCH.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.082
WAIT, THAT MEANS
I'M WALKING HOME
WITH FARKLE?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.083
YOU'RE WEARING
MY RING.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.052
BOY, THE STUFF
YOU GOT TO DO.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.792
I'M NOT SURE IT'S
GOING TO WORK OUT
WITH THEM.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.127
YOU THINK?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.596
SO YOU'RE WALKING
ME HOME?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.268
YEAH.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.837
HOLD HANDS?

15:39.839 --> 15:41.806
I GUESS WE SHOULD.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.174
TRY AGAIN.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.411
I WANT TO
VERY MUCH.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.354
OOH!

15:57.324 --> 15:59.490
YEAH THIS ISN'T
GOING TO BE
WEIRD AT ALL.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.837
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
MY NAME IS CALLED?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.639
AUGGIE'S MOMMY.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.808
TOPANGA.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.177
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.579
YOU THINK YOU
HAVE A FUNNY NAME?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.181
I HAVE A FUNNY
NAME TOO.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.615
AND WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL,

16:24.617 --> 16:27.418
I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY
MY PARENTS WOULD DO THAT TO ME.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.220
I KNOW, RIGHT?

16:30.790 --> 16:32.574
BUT THEN,

16:32.575 --> 16:34.359
I FOUND OUT
THAT THEY LOVE ME VERY MUCH.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.362
AND THEY GAVE ME
A NAME THAT WAS
IMPORTANT TO THEM.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.163
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR NAME MEANS?

16:40.900 --> 16:43.201
EVERY MORNING,
BEFORE THE SUN
COMES UP,

16:43.203 --> 16:44.602
THE GROUND
IS WET.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.805
AND THAT WATER
IS A GIFT FOR THE
FLOWERS AND THE GRASS.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.374
SO THAT THEY CAN GROW.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.243
AND THEY CAN MAKE
THE WORLD MORE BEAUTIFUL.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.745
YOU WERE GIVEN
YOUR NAME

16:53.747 --> 16:56.881
BECAUSE YOU MAKE
YOUR PARENTS' WORLD
MORE BEAUTIFUL.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.182
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND ME?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.386
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT WATER IS CALLED

17:01.388 --> 17:02.420
THAT'S THERE
FOR THE GRASS

17:02.422 --> 17:03.955
EVERY MORNING
BEFORE YOU WAKE UP?

17:03.957 --> 17:05.189
YES.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.457
WHAT IS IT?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.393
MORNING DOY.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.599
OKAY, GET OUT
OF HERE, DOY.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.900
Auggie and Doy:
YAY!

17:21.908 --> 17:22.940
HE BROKE YA.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.475
YEAH, HE DID.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.211
YOU KNOW,
TOPANGA,

17:27.213 --> 17:28.646
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I'VE LEARNED

17:28.648 --> 17:30.281
FROM BEING
A TEACHER

17:30.283 --> 17:34.285
IS THAT SOMETIMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET
KIDS LIVE.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.291
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, LUCAS.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.926
I HAD A
WONDERFUL TIME.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.779
YOU'RE WELCOME, RILEY.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.296
I ALSO HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME AS WELL.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.600
UH, WHAT ARE
YOU KIDS DOING?

17:49.602 --> 17:51.569
YOU GUYS LOOK
REALLY AWKWARD AND STIFF.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.838
IS THIS ABOUT
THAT KISS I HEARD ABOUT?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.406
WHAT?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.876
EVERYBODY PRESSURING
YOU TO BE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.430
NOT READY!

18:02.431 --> 18:03.480
PLEASE, STOP
HOLDING HANDS.
YOU LOOK CRAZY!

18:05.251 --> 18:06.634
YOU TWO ARE
A PART

18:06.635 --> 18:08.018
OF THE BEST GROUP
OF FRIENDS I HAVE
EVER SEEN.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.654
AND IF YOU'RE GOING
TO LET SOME STUPID,

18:09.656 --> 18:11.456
OUTSIDE PRESSURE
HURT THAT,

18:11.457 --> 18:13.257
THEN YOU'RE NOT
ANYWHERE NEAR AS
SMART AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.594
BUT SOMETIMES
THE RIGHT PRESSURE
CAN TURN INTO A DIAMOND.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.464
YEAH, AND THE WRONG
PRESSURE TURNS YOU
INTO DUST.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.965
DO YOU WANT
TO BE DUST?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.502
I DON'T WANT
TO BE DUST.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.536
LUCAS?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.004
I REALLY LIKE
YOU, RILEY.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.973
WE ALWAYS HAVE
SUCH A GREAT TIME
TOGETHER.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.675
WE SHOULD
BREAK UP.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.313
WE SHOULD BREAK UP
RIGHT NOW.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.448
THIS HAS BEEN
MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIP.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.751
HEY RILEY,
DO YOU HAVE TO BE HOME?

18:43.389 --> 18:45.723
NO, WE COULD
GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.892
I'D LIKE THAT.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.060
YEAH, LIKE YOU USED TO
WHEN IT WAS EASY.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.633
LET THE KIDS
LIVE, HUH?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.301
LET THE KIDS
LIVE, HUH?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.337
HA! DEWEY!

18:59.339 --> 19:01.572
GET BACK HERE.
WE'RE NOT DONE, DEWEY!

19:04.310 --> 19:05.743
RUN, DOY!

19:13.786 --> 19:15.786
ALRIGHT, SO THE
PRESSURE'S OFF.
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.421
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

19:17.423 --> 19:20.391
WHAT DO YOU TALK
ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.492
WELL, WHEN I'M
WITH MY FRIENDS,

19:21.494 --> 19:22.760
WE USUALLY TALK
ABOUT SPORTS.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.829
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SPORTS?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.030
NO?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.683
ANY SPORTS?
LIKE...

19:28.684 --> 19:30.401
WHAT ABOUT BASKETBALL?
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BASKETBALL?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.702
YEAH...

19:31.704 --> 19:34.105
-YEAH?
-YEAH.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.339
MAYBE?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.807
WELL, WE'RE IN NEW YORK,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.676
SO OBVIOUSLY,
MY FAVORITE TEAM ARE THE KNICKS.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.645
AND YOU KNOW,
THIS MAY NOT BE OUR BEST YEAR

19:40.647 --> 19:42.664
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER

19:42.665 --> 19:44.682
BECAUSE WE HAVE MELO,
AND WE HAVE PHIL JACKSON,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.517
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRADED J.R. SMITH!

19:46.518 --> 19:48.351
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT
OUR BEST SEASON.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.555
WE HAVE A TERRIBLE RECORD,
WE'RE THE WORST IN THE NBA!

19:50.557 --> 19:53.457
I AM AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,
I SEE ALL THESE FAKE FANS

19:53.459 --> 19:57.094
JUST JUMPING ONTO BANDWAGONS
LIKE THE HEAT OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.564
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS NOT WHAT A TRUE FAN IS!

19:59.566 --> 20:02.133
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE GARDEN, YOU BETTER
REPRESENT THE KNICKS!

20:08.141 --> 20:10.041
I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH
OBVIOUSLY.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.411
I REALLY LIKE YOU, RILEY.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.058
HEY, LUCAS AND I ARE FRIENDS.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.261
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE,
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

20:30.262 --> 20:33.463
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO HURT
THAT BECAUSE YOU GUYS WANT US
TO BE SOMETHING WE'RE NOT.

20:33.466 --> 20:38.135
SO, GO BACK TO YOUR OWN LIVES
BECAUSE NOBODY IS MOVING
TOO FAST HERE.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.041
'SUP.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.157
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.026
I'VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.262
HI, MY NAME'S TOPANGA,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.464
DOY.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.999
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS DOING TODAY?

21:08.001 --> 21:10.901
I WAS MAKING A 400-POUND MAN
CONFESS TO HIS CRIMES.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.670
YOU THINK I CAN'T HANDLE YOU?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.939
DOY!

21:14.941 --> 21:17.208
TOPANGA, LET THE KID
GO TO SLEEP.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.745
I'M FINE, MR. MATTHEWS.
I GOT THIS.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.315
OKAY.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.149
YOU CAN GO TO SLEEP
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.086
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY ONE
LITTLE WORD.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.521
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT WORD IS, KID?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.622
DOY!

21:32.792 --> 21:35.026
DOY, DOY, DOY, DOY,
DOY-DOY-DOY-DOY-DOY!
