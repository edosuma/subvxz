Last season on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:02.663 --> 00:04.393
I will kill your wife,

00:04.546 --> 00:06.791
I will kill your
infant daughter.

00:06.958 --> 00:09.581
- Skyler White sent you?
- Just checking writing times.

00:10.387 --> 00:11.715
Brock... how is he doing?

00:11.885 --> 00:13.425
He just keeps getting worse.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.299
He's not safe.
He was poisoned.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.894
It wasn't the ricine.
It was the lily of the valley.

00:21.473 --> 00:22.652
What about Mike?

00:22.767 --> 00:24.779
With this injury?
No travel.

00:28.387 --> 00:29.950
We've got work to do.

00:32.497 --> 00:33.832
Here you go.

01:03.527 --> 01:04.995
What happened there?

01:07.864 --> 01:09.265
It's my birthday.

01:09.299 --> 01:11.300
Yeah? Well,
Happy Birthday.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.937
Birthday meals are
free at Denny's.

01:14.972 --> 01:16.505
All you gotta show
is a valid ID.

01:16.539 --> 01:18.441
I'm good. Thanks.

01:18.475 --> 01:22.278
Really? Free meal.
Free is good.

01:22.312 --> 01:25.146
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

01:28.117 --> 01:29.284
Okay.

01:36.325 --> 01:39.693
New Hampshire. You're
a long way from home.

01:39.727 --> 01:40.927
How long a drive is that?

01:40.928 --> 01:44.507
About 30 hours
before you stop for gas.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.600
Wow. You headed
to California?

01:46.634 --> 01:49.836
No. Here.

01:52.607 --> 01:54.708
So what's here?

02:00.981 --> 02:02.482
Business.

02:02.516 --> 02:04.050
You know, I was in Boston once,

02:04.084 --> 02:06.452
Boston and a little town
called Swampscott,

02:06.487 --> 02:08.488
which is right
outside of Boston.

02:08.521 --> 02:10.256
That's kind of near
New Hampshire, right?

02:11.690 --> 02:13.225
Uh...

02:13.259 --> 02:15.560
Yeah. More or less.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.997
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

02:19.032 --> 02:21.833
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

02:21.867 --> 02:24.436
Yeah.
Great science museum there.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.173
Excuse me.

02:31.510 --> 02:34.311
Hi. My name's Lucy.
I'll be your server.

02:53.364 --> 02:56.599
I get to worry this one would
end up crossing the border?

02:58.635 --> 03:00.902
It's never leaving town.

03:00.937 --> 03:05.874
Is there a... a manual?
Instruction manual?

03:05.908 --> 03:07.742
I pulled something
off the internet.

03:07.777 --> 03:09.445
It's in there.

03:12.648 --> 03:14.550
Good luck, I guess.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.019
Happy Birthday,
Mr. Lambert.

05:07.963 --> 05:10.765
Jesus, Walt, the news here...

05:10.799 --> 05:12.433
Gus Fring is dead.

05:12.468 --> 05:16.674
He was blown up along with some
person from some Mexican cartel,

05:16.786 --> 05:19.826
and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

05:20.776 --> 05:22.410
Do you know about this?

05:24.312 --> 05:25.579
Walt?

05:27.848 --> 05:31.652
- Walt, I need you to...
- It's over.

05:33.854 --> 05:35.088
<i>We're safe.</i>

05:50.504 --> 05:52.104
Was this you?

05:56.542 --> 05:58.276
<i>What happened?</i>

06:00.079 --> 06:01.613
I won.

07:15.383 --> 07:16.783
Oh, God.

07:45.578 --> 07:47.445
Dad.

07:48.847 --> 07:50.815
- Dad.
- Hey.

07:50.849 --> 07:53.250
Hey.

07:53.285 --> 07:56.287
You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

07:56.322 --> 07:59.290
Uh, no, sorry, I...
No...

07:59.325 --> 08:01.726
You didn't tell him
about Mr. Fring?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.827
Um, he knows.

08:03.861 --> 08:04.828
I...

08:04.862 --> 08:05.829
Welcome home.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.831
Jesus, dad, it...

08:07.865 --> 08:10.334
It's all they're talking about.

08:10.368 --> 08:13.036
They... they haven't
said it on TV yet,

08:13.070 --> 08:16.473
but Uncle Hank says he was this,
major, major drug dealer.

08:16.507 --> 08:19.642
I mean, like, holy shit.

08:19.676 --> 08:23.312
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

08:23.347 --> 08:25.981
Uncle Hank was
after this guy all along.

08:26.015 --> 08:28.217
He didn't tell us, but he was.

08:28.251 --> 08:30.820
He even took me
to his restaurant one time,

08:30.854 --> 08:34.188
just, like, totally toying
with the guy,

08:34.224 --> 08:37.092
just like "I got my eye
on you," like that.

08:37.126 --> 08:40.062
They figure
Mr. Fring is the one

08:40.096 --> 08:42.063
who put the hit out
on Uncle Hank.

08:42.097 --> 08:44.366
Just somebody got to him first.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.367
Wow.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.202
Yeah, wow.

08:47.237 --> 08:51.939
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.
She didn't want us to leave.

08:51.974 --> 08:54.876
But mom figured it was time.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.477
Huh.

08:56.511 --> 08:58.712
There's still some agents
over there,

08:58.747 --> 09:02.049
but they figure it's over.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.818
Like, when this hits the news,

09:04.853 --> 09:07.088
Uncle Hank
is going to be a hero.

09:07.122 --> 09:08.155
Yeah.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.223
I mean, even more so
than before.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.526
Seriously.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.728
See... See if it's on TV.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.229
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

09:16.264 --> 09:28.974
Just... just give me
a couple minutes, huh?

09:31.211 --> 09:33.446
Hi.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.814
Hi.

09:39.686 --> 09:41.453
Hi, sweet pea.

09:41.487 --> 09:43.855
Oh, daddy missed you so much.

09:46.225 --> 09:48.026
Yes, he did.

09:48.060 --> 09:51.797
I know.
I missed you, too.

09:57.536 --> 10:00.571
Well, don't you think
I rate a "hello," at least?

10:04.009 --> 10:05.176
Hello.

10:07.379 --> 10:08.612
Hello.

10:11.383 --> 10:12.716
Hello to you, too.

10:17.121 --> 10:19.489
So are you gonna talk
to me here?

10:21.092 --> 10:21.891
Are you gonna...

10:21.926 --> 10:24.761
You gonna show some kind of...

10:26.331 --> 10:28.798
I don't know...
Some kind of mild relief

10:28.833 --> 10:30.399
that I'm alive?

10:32.336 --> 10:34.070
I am relieved, Walt.

10:36.139 --> 10:37.506
And scared.

10:39.509 --> 10:40.709
Scared?

10:41.744 --> 10:43.279
Scared of what?

10:47.016 --> 10:48.249
You.

10:55.924 --> 10:57.292
Hey.

11:01.229 --> 11:02.629
Hi.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.056
Oh, shit.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.534
Jesus, just say it already.

12:53.569 --> 12:55.335
Tell me "I told you so."

12:55.369 --> 12:56.570
Get it out of your system

12:56.605 --> 12:59.339
before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

12:59.373 --> 13:01.875
It's exactly like
Boetticher's drawings.

13:03.912 --> 13:09.149
- Where were the two bodies?
- Over the fright elevator, over there.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.186
No idea who they were?

13:14.221 --> 13:15.888
Nah, not much left.

13:15.923 --> 13:19.158
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot,

13:19.192 --> 13:20.927
so they tell me.

13:20.961 --> 13:23.496
Whoever torched it,
did it up right.

13:29.436 --> 13:31.703
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

13:42.314 --> 13:45.617
Huh. What do you
figure that was?

13:45.651 --> 13:56.093
I don't know. Some kind
of lab equipment?

13:56.128 --> 13:57.662
Maybe a camera?

14:12.943 --> 14:17.012
Come on. Be nice.
Just be nice.

14:19.383 --> 14:21.050
You be nice. Just be nice.

14:21.084 --> 14:22.418
Let Wendell in there.

14:23.587 --> 14:26.656
If Wendell doesn't eat,
nobody eats.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.123
Yeah.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.325
Are you sure?
Are you completely sure?

14:30.359 --> 14:35.397
And what about...?
Yes, I will tell him. Yes, I will tell him.

14:39.935 --> 14:41.703
It's Gustavo.

14:43.639 --> 14:44.939
He's dead.

15:20.473 --> 15:22.441
Son of a bitch.

15:24.043 --> 15:26.010
Son of a bitch.

15:26.045 --> 15:27.578
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hold up! Hold up!

15:27.613 --> 15:29.013
Get out of my way, kid.

15:29.048 --> 15:30.448
Mike, wait a minute,
all right? Let him talk.

15:30.482 --> 15:31.883
"Let him talk." I am done

15:31.917 --> 15:33.918
listening to this asshole talk.

15:33.953 --> 15:35.620
Now get out of my way.

15:35.654 --> 15:37.922
He's got something
you need to hear, all right?

15:37.923 --> 15:39.557
What did you do, Jesse?

15:39.591 --> 15:40.891
Do you even know?

15:40.925 --> 15:44.427
- Do you even know what you've done?
- Yeah, he saved his own life...

15:44.462 --> 15:45.695
One more word...

15:45.730 --> 15:47.497
Mike. Mike.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.466
If you kill him, you're
going to have to kill me.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.135
Come on.

15:53.104 --> 15:55.838
Oh, Jesse.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.573
Jesus.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.210
What is it with you guys?

16:01.245 --> 16:03.146
Honest to God.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.415
May I?

16:08.385 --> 16:12.587
Look. Whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

16:12.621 --> 16:15.090
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.826
Bigger fish.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.427
The video cameras.

16:19.461 --> 16:22.330
Gus kept cameras on us
at the lab,

16:22.364 --> 16:24.800
at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.234
And, of course,
when I say "us,"

16:26.269 --> 16:27.568
including you.

16:27.603 --> 16:28.903
Mike.

16:30.205 --> 16:32.506
Mike, if he taped
all that shit...

16:32.540 --> 16:35.276
Us cooking, you picking up...

16:35.310 --> 16:38.913
If Gus had a record of that and the
police get to it before we do...

16:38.947 --> 16:41.816
- You son of a bitch.
- Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,

16:41.850 --> 16:44.483
or a hard drive.

16:44.518 --> 16:45.985
Where?

16:46.020 --> 16:47.420
Where did he keep it?

16:50.590 --> 16:55.895
He had a laptop in his office.
He kept it at the back of the restaurant.

16:57.264 --> 16:59.365
It all fed straight to there.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.040
What?

17:09.075 --> 17:10.976
Keys, scumbag.

17:11.010 --> 17:14.112
It's the universal symbol
for keys.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.229
<i>Meter fraud.</i>

17:45.263 --> 17:47.699
Yes, yes, it's a big deal.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.702
Guy rigs his meter
so he's paying two cents less

17:50.736 --> 17:52.570
for first-class postage.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.304
I'm here to tell you

17:54.338 --> 17:57.240
that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

17:57.274 --> 18:01.311
It's money out of your pocket.
It's money out of my pocket.

18:01.345 --> 18:04.915
I was hoping...
Now, look, sarge.

18:04.949 --> 18:07.017
Do you think we could work
together on this thing?

18:07.051 --> 18:08.652
You folks have it over there?

18:08.686 --> 18:10.519
Could you tell me that,
at least?

18:13.957 --> 18:15.057
Yeah.

18:16.059 --> 18:17.326
Yeah.

18:19.129 --> 18:20.963
Well, thanks for your help.

18:20.964 --> 18:23.465
Uh, Inspector Clark,
Inspector Dave Clark,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.267
like the Dave Clark Five?

18:26.268 --> 18:28.503
Oh, before your time.

18:28.537 --> 18:31.906
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

18:31.941 --> 18:36.911
Yes, sir.
No, you as well.

18:39.448 --> 18:40.815
Oh, yeah.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.817
We're boned.

18:47.488 --> 18:48.588
Well...

18:50.692 --> 18:52.259
You know how they say

18:52.293 --> 18:54.061
"it's been a pleasure"?

18:55.296 --> 18:56.664
It hasn't.

18:57.898 --> 19:00.099
Are you going to tell us
about the laptop?

19:00.134 --> 19:04.037
- Where you going?
- I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid,

19:04.071 --> 19:05.337
and so should you.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.106
It's just a matter of time.

19:07.141 --> 19:08.708
Mike,

19:08.742 --> 19:10.609
where is the laptop?

19:10.644 --> 19:11.944
What the hell difference
does it make?

19:11.979 --> 19:13.712
They got it. End of story.

19:20.687 --> 19:24.489
APD, Northwest area command,
on 2nd.

19:24.523 --> 19:26.524
They tagged it, they filed it,

19:26.559 --> 19:28.093
it's in the system,

19:28.127 --> 19:30.427
and they locked it
in their evidence room.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.463
All right.

19:33.498 --> 19:37.668
All right. So...
Describe the building.

19:37.703 --> 19:40.071
Describe the...

19:40.105 --> 19:42.106
How about I describe Fort Knox?

19:42.140 --> 19:43.741
And what are you going to do?

19:43.775 --> 19:47.777
Are you going to put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a close line?

19:47.812 --> 19:50.479
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

19:50.514 --> 19:53.583
And why in the hell
am I talking to you?

19:53.617 --> 19:56.252
Mike, we gotta do something.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.723
I am doing something.

19:59.757 --> 20:02.124
He's good with this stuff.
Just give him a chance.

20:02.158 --> 20:04.292
Now, you look.

20:04.327 --> 20:07.495
That laptop might as well
be on the Moon.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.164
They build these evidence rooms

20:09.199 --> 20:11.900
like bank vaults
because guess what.

20:11.935 --> 20:14.970
Lunatics like you
want to break into them.

20:15.004 --> 20:20.815
But unlike a bank vault this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day

20:20.843 --> 20:22.676
by the police.

20:22.711 --> 20:25.113
There's no way you're
getting it out of there.

20:25.147 --> 20:32.153
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

20:32.187 --> 20:34.788
We just need to destroy
what's on it.

20:34.789 --> 20:37.590
Oh, so now you want
to blow up a police station.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.525
I don't believe
I said that, no.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.462
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

20:42.496 --> 20:43.830
Now you want to kill
a bunch of cops.

20:43.865 --> 20:46.332
I've never said anything
about killing anybody.

20:46.367 --> 20:49.469
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

20:49.503 --> 20:51.771
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

20:51.805 --> 20:54.974
Say this device
gets filed into evidence.

20:55.008 --> 20:56.575
Now, it is inside that room.

20:56.609 --> 20:57.977
What about a magnet?

20:58.011 --> 20:59.245
You want to commit
a whole other crime

20:59.279 --> 21:01.180
just to get this bomb
of yours into evidence.

21:01.214 --> 21:03.282
Who said bomb?
I said a device.

21:03.316 --> 21:05.550
- Yo, what about, like, a magnet?
- An incendiary device.

21:05.585 --> 21:07.385
One quick fire
is all it would take.

21:07.419 --> 21:09.053
You don't think they have
fire suppression?

21:09.088 --> 21:10.255
I'm not talking
about sprinklers.

21:10.289 --> 21:13.590
I'm talking about halon, because
halon doesn't destroy evidence.

21:13.624 --> 21:15.259
- A magnet, though, maybe like...
- All right, so a bomb, then.

21:15.293 --> 21:17.627
Maybe we plant a bomb outside.

21:17.662 --> 21:19.963
Oh, actually I knew
a crew out of Fort Worth

21:19.998 --> 21:22.432
that tried to blow up an
evidence room from outside.

21:22.466 --> 21:24.902
About all they did was
take out a couple of hedges.

21:24.936 --> 21:27.304
You are probably talking
about 2 feet

21:27.338 --> 21:29.005
of reinforced concrete.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.639
Or what about a magnet?

21:30.674 --> 21:33.009
What magnet?
What about it?

21:33.043 --> 21:35.845
You know, just a...

21:50.426 --> 21:53.829
So what do you think?

21:53.863 --> 21:54.996
Expensive.

21:55.031 --> 21:57.332
Leaving aside engineering,

21:57.366 --> 22:00.302
rigging some kind of
alternate power source,

22:00.336 --> 22:04.338
my primary sticking point
is I actually need the thing,

22:04.372 --> 22:05.906
as you gentlemen can see,

22:05.941 --> 22:07.374
it's paying the bills.

22:07.408 --> 22:10.945
But I mean it's
feasible, doable?

22:10.979 --> 22:12.379
Hey, we're living in a time

22:12.413 --> 22:15.216
of, uh, string theories
and God particles.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.351
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

22:18.385 --> 22:19.719
Expensive.

22:21.455 --> 22:28.161
What would you put it in?

22:28.195 --> 22:31.064
What about that?
Does it run?

22:31.098 --> 22:33.298
We can get it running.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.767
What's the box made of?

22:35.801 --> 22:37.769
Plywood and aluminum...
just what you need.

22:39.973 --> 22:42.374
All right,
so you want to talk money?

22:44.543 --> 22:45.878
Step into my office.

22:50.349 --> 22:52.316
Hey, listen. Um...

22:53.919 --> 22:56.053
I don't actually have
any money right now.

22:57.455 --> 23:01.425
My wife... There's
an IRS issue anyway.

23:01.459 --> 23:03.694
I'd appreciate it if you
could spot me my share.

23:03.728 --> 23:07.430
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, whatever.

23:07.464 --> 23:08.765
Right.

23:11.535 --> 23:12.802
You coming?

23:14.005 --> 23:15.205
If you have any brains,

23:15.239 --> 23:16.773
you'll take that money you save

23:16.807 --> 23:19.009
and you'll skip town...

23:19.043 --> 23:20.877
Today. Right now.

23:22.379 --> 23:23.946
You don't think this can work?

23:23.980 --> 23:26.515
Is that a serious question?

23:26.549 --> 23:28.650
Mike,
this is a three-man job.

23:28.684 --> 23:30.485
The only way I know
it won't work for sure

23:30.520 --> 23:32.087
is if we don't have you.

24:05.619 --> 24:07.354
Come in.

24:09.723 --> 24:11.123
Oh. Get in.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.092
Close the door.

24:13.126 --> 24:15.895
What did we
say about you coming here?

24:15.930 --> 24:18.965
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up,

24:18.999 --> 24:21.768
uh, the police...They may call.

24:21.802 --> 24:23.436
Let me...
let me back up a little.

24:23.471 --> 24:25.871
Can I s... can I sit down?
I'm going to sit down.

24:25.905 --> 24:28.907
Okay, w-w-why are
the police going to call?

24:28.942 --> 24:31.844
May call you. Distant,
outside possibility.

24:31.878 --> 24:35.046
But on the off chance I want you
thinking one thought...

24:35.081 --> 24:36.782
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

24:36.816 --> 24:38.951
Sergeant Schultz.
Do you remember Sergeant Schultz?

24:38.985 --> 24:41.052
"I know nothing.
I see nothing."

24:41.087 --> 24:43.754
Do you remember how he...
I want you like that.

24:43.789 --> 24:47.358
- Okay, Saul, why are the police...
- There was a incident, with Beneke...

24:47.392 --> 24:49.059
Oh, God.

24:49.094 --> 24:51.863
- And it's...
- Oh, Jesus. What incident?

24:51.897 --> 24:53.397
An act of God.

24:53.431 --> 24:54.999
There's no right.
There's no wrong.

24:55.033 --> 24:58.034
I mean, it just...
that's the best phrase.

24:58.068 --> 25:02.038
It fits, but we got a problem.

25:06.477 --> 25:07.911
Ted's dead.

25:09.714 --> 25:10.680
Sorry?

25:10.715 --> 25:12.949
Ted is dead?

25:12.984 --> 25:15.651
No. No, no.

25:15.685 --> 25:18.053
He just woke up.

25:24.014 --> 25:26.750
Right-o, that should do 'er.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.818
All right, watches off

25:28.853 --> 25:32.723
necklaces, earrings,
rings, bracelets...

25:32.757 --> 25:34.324
Gold.
These are non-ferrous.

25:34.359 --> 25:35.659
Better hope.

25:35.693 --> 25:37.293
What about that stuff
you young guys wear

25:37.294 --> 25:38.494
on the end or your pricks?

25:38.528 --> 25:41.597
Speak now
or forever sing soprano.

25:41.598 --> 25:43.332
What's up with that,
by the way?

25:43.367 --> 25:45.134
Why would anybody
wanna put a metal ring

25:45.168 --> 25:46.502
through the end of the prick?

25:48.538 --> 25:50.038
What are you looking at me for?

25:51.141 --> 25:54.342
All right, uh, guns, knives,

25:54.377 --> 25:57.412
tools, keys, plates
in your head,

25:57.446 --> 25:59.414
artificial hips.

25:59.515 --> 26:01.793
Check your pockets one
more time, please.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.153
Oh, uh, credit cards.

26:05.187 --> 26:08.955
You want that plastic working,
come Miller Time.

26:08.990 --> 26:13.294
You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing,

26:13.328 --> 26:16.463
and not a single one of them
involves Miller Time.

26:16.498 --> 26:18.499
P.M.A.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.634
Positive mental attitude.

26:20.669 --> 26:23.003
Uh, okay, I think
we're good to go.

26:24.105 --> 26:26.539
All right, where do you
want me with this?

26:26.573 --> 26:27.840
Start 40 feet out.

26:27.874 --> 26:29.509
That's more than
the length of the room.

26:29.543 --> 26:31.277
- Who's doing the honors?
- Me.

26:31.312 --> 26:33.279
Flip that switch, turns it on.

26:33.314 --> 26:35.515
Twist this here.
That's your power control.

26:35.549 --> 26:37.149
- All right.
- Everybody ready?

26:37.184 --> 26:38.984
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:39.019 --> 26:40.952
Fire in the hole!

26:44.457 --> 26:46.090
All right, you ready?

26:59.538 --> 27:02.239
Fingers crossed it don't
yank the drive shaft

27:02.273 --> 27:03.407
through the floor.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.722
Anything?

27:23.259 --> 27:25.160
No. Still working.

27:26.162 --> 27:28.797
All right, start walking.

27:39.641 --> 27:41.075
Whoa. Whoa-whoa.

27:41.109 --> 27:42.677
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

27:42.711 --> 27:44.211
Yeah. That did it.

27:47.282 --> 27:49.350
Yes.

27:49.385 --> 27:50.817
Whoa.

27:55.523 --> 27:57.491
Yeah, bitch!

27:57.525 --> 27:59.893
Magnets! Oh!

28:02.430 --> 28:04.531
How many batteries is this?

28:04.565 --> 28:07.165
That there's 21,
wired in series,

28:07.200 --> 28:11.203
so 21 times 12, 252 volts.

28:11.237 --> 28:13.873
Can you add 21 more,
wired in parallel?

28:13.907 --> 28:16.041
Up the amperage?

28:22.515 --> 28:24.849
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room,

28:24.884 --> 28:27.118
it's gonna make
one hell of a noise,

28:27.152 --> 28:29.020
and there goes your
element of surprise.

28:30.022 --> 28:31.756
Won't matter.

28:31.791 --> 28:33.825
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.584
Hi. Who are you looking for?

29:01.618 --> 29:04.219
Um, Ted Beneke.
I'm a friend of his.

29:04.254 --> 29:06.322
But if it's not a good time,
I could...

29:06.356 --> 29:08.157
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up.

29:08.191 --> 29:09.391
Come on in.

29:22.705 --> 29:24.038
Hey, Ted.

29:27.008 --> 29:28.642
I tell you,
he's been a real champ.

29:28.677 --> 29:31.211
His color's better,
and his blood pressure's up.

29:31.245 --> 29:32.446
We are going to have you

29:32.481 --> 29:34.348
eating solid food
in a day or two.

29:34.382 --> 29:35.950
I bet you money.

29:36.952 --> 29:38.385
That's wonderful.

29:40.188 --> 29:42.089
All right,
I'm just down the hall.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.467
Ted.

29:54.568 --> 29:57.563
Can you hear me?

30:01.875 --> 30:03.141
Yes.

30:06.913 --> 30:08.446
Ted, I just...

30:13.185 --> 30:15.953
Skyler...

30:15.988 --> 30:18.589
I haven't said anything...

30:20.792 --> 30:22.326
to anyone.

30:25.631 --> 30:28.198
I told them it was an accident.

30:29.701 --> 30:33.803
I tripped and fell.

30:33.838 --> 30:35.271
That is all they know.

30:38.342 --> 30:39.676
I just...

30:42.680 --> 30:45.248
I've... I've got children.

30:47.150 --> 30:48.551
Family.

30:50.453 --> 30:51.887
I swear to you.

30:54.257 --> 30:55.724
Please.

30:57.961 --> 30:59.094
I just...

31:04.266 --> 31:05.366
I...

31:06.835 --> 31:10.137
will never breathe...

31:11.506 --> 31:15.176
one word of this.

31:24.686 --> 31:25.919
Good.

32:46.328 --> 32:50.098
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

32:50.133 --> 32:51.900
We'll do a loop and come
around the other side.

32:51.934 --> 32:53.101
Turn here.

33:05.547 --> 33:07.447
Right up there.

33:07.482 --> 33:09.616
That's the wall.

33:09.651 --> 33:11.017
Oh, what the hell is this?

33:11.052 --> 33:13.186
There's some big-ass hump
in the way.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.889
So just drive over it.

33:15.923 --> 33:17.891
- All right.
- You can do it.

33:17.925 --> 33:20.326
Take it easy. Take it easy.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.729
You got it.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.204
Cut it.

33:33.206 --> 33:34.506
It's, like, 8 feet away.

33:34.540 --> 33:36.474
Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

33:36.509 --> 33:38.143
It'll work.

34:59.187 --> 35:00.554
Mr. White, let's go.

35:00.589 --> 35:02.657
Hang on.

35:02.691 --> 35:04.457
- Let's just go!
- Hang on.

35:04.492 --> 35:07.194
Mr. White,
let's get out of here.

35:07.228 --> 35:08.528
Just...

35:08.562 --> 35:11.331
one minute.

35:17.839 --> 35:20.039
Whoops.
Turn it off!

35:20.073 --> 35:21.274
Turn it off.

35:26.847 --> 35:28.514
Jacocks, you okay?

35:29.616 --> 35:31.050
Outside! Outside!

35:50.469 --> 35:51.936
Oh!

35:51.970 --> 35:53.938
Yes! Bitch!

35:53.972 --> 35:56.040
- Shut up.
- Oh. Yeah.

35:56.074 --> 35:57.975
What exactly
are you celebrating?

35:58.009 --> 35:59.210
You left the truck behind.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.444
So what?

36:00.478 --> 36:01.912
So what?

36:01.947 --> 36:03.547
So what if they find prints?

36:03.581 --> 36:06.851
And what if they trace it
back to the wrecking yard?

36:06.885 --> 36:08.751
They won't.

36:08.785 --> 36:10.720
There's no prints.
I made sure of that.

36:10.754 --> 36:12.788
There's no paperwork
on the truck,

36:12.823 --> 36:14.557
the magnet, or the batteries.

36:14.591 --> 36:17.460
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

36:17.494 --> 36:19.562
I made sure of that, too.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.164
Well, you got all the answers,

36:21.198 --> 36:22.866
so you tell me, answer man,

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
did all that
even work just now?

36:24.934 --> 36:27.837
Yes. It worked.

36:27.871 --> 36:30.573
I'm supposed to
take that on faith?

36:30.607 --> 36:32.375
Yeah?

36:32.409 --> 36:33.676
Why?

36:33.710 --> 36:36.846
How do we know?

36:36.880 --> 36:38.347
Because I say so.

37:06.772 --> 37:10.141
07-66-26432.

37:10.175 --> 37:11.909
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

37:11.944 --> 37:13.276
Roofing hammer.

37:14.345 --> 37:16.579
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

37:22.654 --> 37:25.889
11-58-73321.

37:25.923 --> 37:27.490
Fring, Gustavo.

37:27.525 --> 37:29.458
Samsung laptop computer.

37:29.492 --> 37:32.828
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

37:32.863 --> 37:34.396
Bag still sealed.

37:42.906 --> 37:46.508
11-58-73317.

37:46.543 --> 37:47.976
Fring, Gustavo.

37:48.010 --> 37:49.545
Framed photograph of two men.

37:49.579 --> 37:50.812
Damaged.

37:50.846 --> 37:53.081
The glass is broken,

37:53.115 --> 37:55.284
and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

37:55.318 --> 37:58.820
Bag appears to be slightly
punctured by broken glass.

37:59.989 --> 38:02.523
Hm. Check it out.

38:04.726 --> 38:06.093
That's not on the manifest.

38:07.796 --> 38:09.330
All right, so first off,

38:09.364 --> 38:11.031
I'm not a marriage counselor.

38:11.066 --> 38:12.633
Nor do I takes sides
in this thing.

38:12.668 --> 38:17.171
And, not taking sides, mind you, but
you did put her in charge of your money,

38:17.206 --> 38:20.207
which I advised against,
if you'll recall,

38:20.241 --> 38:23.243
all of which is not to be
construed as an "I told you so".

38:23.277 --> 38:25.913
I'm just walking you
through my mental process,

38:25.947 --> 38:27.848
so to speak.

38:31.485 --> 38:33.486
So she comes to me
with a problem.

38:33.521 --> 38:35.154
She's been cooking
Beneke's books,

38:35.189 --> 38:36.723
he's in Dutch with the IRS,

38:36.757 --> 38:38.057
and once they audit,

38:38.092 --> 38:40.093
it's "Rio de caca"
for the both of them,

38:40.127 --> 38:44.597
to which I say "hey, let's involve
Walt in this discussion,"

38:44.631 --> 38:47.700
to which she says, "no,
let's cut Beneke a check

38:47.735 --> 38:49.702
so's he can pay off the IRS."

38:49.736 --> 38:51.636
Again, not taking sides,

38:51.670 --> 38:53.905
but she really was
trying to protect you.

38:57.143 --> 38:59.477
A little feedback here
might be nice.

39:01.547 --> 39:04.716
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

39:04.751 --> 39:06.416
Yeah, that's what I told her.

39:06.451 --> 39:07.852
She said no.

39:07.886 --> 39:10.187
And you didn't argue the point.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.256
You didn't think to contact me.

39:14.525 --> 39:16.093
You were a tad preoccupied

39:16.128 --> 39:18.528
at the time, if you'll recall.

39:18.563 --> 39:23.266
Okay. So you took it
upon yourself

39:23.300 --> 39:28.171
to give away $622,000
of my money

39:28.205 --> 39:31.707
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

39:31.742 --> 39:35.879
She's my client, same as you.

39:35.913 --> 39:38.847
Does this arrangement get
a little tricky at times?

39:38.882 --> 39:43.351
Absolutely. But I try my best,
you know, ethically, my duty...

39:43.386 --> 39:48.456
Ethically? I'm sorry, I must be
hearing things.

39:48.491 --> 39:53.428
Did you actually just use the
word "ethically" in a sentence?

39:53.462 --> 39:55.930
You're not Clarence Darrow,
Saul.

39:55.964 --> 39:58.532
You're a two-bit
bus-bench lawyer,

39:58.566 --> 40:00.201
and you work for me.

40:00.235 --> 40:02.603
Yeah, well, Clarence didn't ever
have a client like you

40:02.637 --> 40:04.605
ask him for something...

40:06.275 --> 40:07.374
like this.

40:07.409 --> 40:10.777
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

40:10.812 --> 40:12.445
Huell, too. Huh?

40:12.479 --> 40:14.080
He's got fingers like hotdogs.

40:14.115 --> 40:15.849
He could've easily busted
this in two

40:15.883 --> 40:19.186
and killed everyone in the
office, but do I complain?

40:19.220 --> 40:22.022
No. Beg, borrow, or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

40:22.056 --> 40:24.925
I go the extra mile.

40:24.959 --> 40:29.295
Only you never told me that the kid
would wind up in the hospital.

40:29.329 --> 40:31.396
You know...

40:31.431 --> 40:33.899
Take that thing and get
the hell out of here.

40:33.934 --> 40:35.367
You and me, we're done.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.785
Come on. Hey.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.120
Hey.

40:58.556 --> 40:59.689
H...

41:01.392 --> 41:03.126
We're done

41:03.161 --> 41:05.462
when I say we're done.

41:56.045 --> 41:57.578
I heard what happened to Ted.

42:00.249 --> 42:02.183
He's not going to talk.

42:02.218 --> 42:03.717
Yeah.

42:29.243 --> 42:30.843
I forgive you.
