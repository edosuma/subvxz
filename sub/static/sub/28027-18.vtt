00:31.244 --> 00:34.604
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:34.764 --> 00:37.124
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:37.284 --> 00:41.363
We are back, and just time
for a quick recap of the week...

00:41.523 --> 00:44.043
a week that saw North Korea
resuming missile launches,

00:44.203 --> 00:47.363
Robert Mueller somehow managing
to irritate all of Congress,

00:47.523 --> 00:50.723
and the president threatening France
with tariffs on their wines

00:50.882 --> 00:53.202
in the dumbest possible way.

00:53.362 --> 00:57.242
I've always liked American wines
better than French wines.

00:57.402 --> 01:02.082
Even though I don't drink wine.
I just like the way they look.

01:02.242 --> 01:05.321
I mean, look,
on one hand, yes, that is stupid.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.921
On the other hand, judging things

01:07.081 --> 01:09.801
purely on their looks is
extremely on-brand for Trump.

01:09.961 --> 01:11.321
He may as well have said,

01:11.481 --> 01:13.401
"I need my wine to be
at least a double D."

01:13.561 --> 01:16.321
It would have made exactly
as much sense as that.

01:16.481 --> 01:18.320
But instead of dwelling
on the president,

01:18.480 --> 01:22.440
let's instead turn to Puerto Rico...
objectively the best island

01:22.600 --> 01:24.520
after, of course, Temptation,

01:24.680 --> 01:26.360
Love, and kitchen.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.999
Sorry, Hawaii, until you can display a
knife block and a decorative fruit bowl

01:31.159 --> 01:34.039
while also having hidden storage,
you're not even on my list.

01:34.199 --> 01:36.879
Daddy needs his feng shui.

01:37.039 --> 01:40.799
There was... there was big news
out of Puerto Rico this week.

01:40.959 --> 01:44.758
<i>The embattled governor of Puerto Rico</i>
<i>finally gives in and steps down.</i>

01:44.918 --> 01:47.478
<i>Protests turn into celebration</i>
<i>in the streets.</i>

01:47.638 --> 01:50.958
<i>After hours of delay,</i>
<i>Rosselló finally said the words</i>

01:51.118 --> 01:54.238
<i>these people had been waiting</i>
<i>12 days to hear:</i>

01:54.398 --> 01:56.237
<i>"I will be resigning."</i>

01:59.757 --> 02:04.157
Holy shit. It does not bode well
for your political career

02:04.317 --> 02:06.317
when people are reacting
to your resignation

02:06.477 --> 02:08.556
like Oprah just gave them a car.

02:08.717 --> 02:11.236
"You get a new governor!
You get a new governor!

02:11.396 --> 02:14.476
Everybody gets a new governor!"

02:14.636 --> 02:17.356
And look, it is hard to overstate

02:17.516 --> 02:19.516
just how historic a moment this was.

02:19.676 --> 02:22.835
Puerto Rico has endured decades
of systemic corruption,

02:22.995 --> 02:25.955
a massive debt crisis,
crippling austerity measures,

02:26.115 --> 02:28.395
an inadequate response
to Hurricane Maria,

02:28.555 --> 02:30.835
and most recently,
a high-profile probe

02:30.995 --> 02:34.275
that saw two former top officials
arrested earlier this month.

02:34.435 --> 02:36.954
But the last straw was this.

02:37.114 --> 02:39.834
<i>Governor Ricardo Rosselló</i>
<i>has been under fire</i>

02:39.994 --> 02:42.594
<i>since nearly 900 pages</i>
<i>of a private group chat</i>

02:42.754 --> 02:44.114
<i>were leaked and published</i>

02:44.274 --> 02:47.034
<i>by the Center for Investigative</i>
<i>Journalism in Puerto Rico.</i>

02:47.194 --> 02:49.033
<i>The reported messages</i>
<i>between Rosselló</i>

02:49.193 --> 02:53.073
<i>and several close aides include</i>
<i>personal attacks on rival politicians,</i>

02:53.233 --> 02:56.273
<i>sexist comments,</i>
<i>and anti-gay slurs.</i>

02:56.433 --> 02:58.113
Yeah, that's not good.

02:58.273 --> 03:01.312
Nobody leaks 900 pages
from a group chat

03:01.472 --> 03:03.712
unless there's something
terrible in it,

03:03.872 --> 03:06.352
because otherwise
all group chats are the same.

03:06.512 --> 03:08.992
There's the girl who writes
in full paragraphs,

03:09.152 --> 03:10.832
the guy who says "K,"

03:10.992 --> 03:13.592
and inevitably,
the one person apologizing

03:13.752 --> 03:16.471
because they thought this was
the chat Danielle wasn't in,

03:16.631 --> 03:19.351
but it turns out it's the group chat
that Danielle was in,

03:19.511 --> 03:21.831
and now she knows McKenna
thinks that she's basic.

03:21.991 --> 03:25.271
I mean, Danielle is basic,
but that's not really the point, is it?

03:25.431 --> 03:27.510
And Rosselló's group chat

03:27.670 --> 03:29.870
was very, very, very bad.

03:30.030 --> 03:33.350
It featured the governor calling one
female adversary a "whore"

03:33.510 --> 03:35.110
and an associate of his saying
he was

03:35.270 --> 03:37.270
"salivating to shoot"
the mayor of San Juan,

03:37.430 --> 03:40.629
to which the governor responded,
"You'd be doing me a grand favor."

03:40.789 --> 03:43.029
But perhaps the most
devastating text

03:43.189 --> 03:45.829
was a joke about
the dead bodies accumulating

03:45.989 --> 03:49.109
during and after Hurricane Maria
at an understaffed morgue.

03:49.269 --> 03:52.389
So it's frankly understandable
that people wanted him gone,

03:52.549 --> 03:55.948
but I don't think anyone
said it better than this protestor.

03:56.108 --> 03:57.868
After the hurricane,

03:58.028 --> 04:00.668
I was hungry.
I didn't have water.

04:00.828 --> 04:02.548
Like, I didn't have anything.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.308
And then this guy was living it up?

04:04.468 --> 04:07.587
No, bruh, you're not fit
to be governor. Out.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.387
Wow. Well, I mean,
she is not wrong there.

04:11.547 --> 04:13.107
I know this isn't the point,

04:13.267 --> 04:16.387
but someone needs to make that woman
the next Bachelorette,

04:16.547 --> 04:19.346
because I would tune in every week

04:19.505 --> 04:21.666
just to watch her look Luke
in the eye and say,

04:21.826 --> 04:25.946
"You wanna know what I'm doing in the
fantasy suite? Nah, bruh, you're out.

04:26.106 --> 04:27.546
"You're out.

04:27.706 --> 04:29.866
No, bruh... no."

04:30.026 --> 04:31.346
The...

04:31.506 --> 04:34.185
the protests against Rosselló
were enormous,

04:34.345 --> 04:36.745
with hundreds of thousands
of people on the streets,

04:36.905 --> 04:39.065
some on bicycles,
some underwater,

04:39.225 --> 04:42.425
and some even on horseback,
which does seem unfair,

04:42.585 --> 04:46.264
since we don't technically know
who the horses support for governor.

04:46.424 --> 04:48.944
You assume you know
what side horses are on,

04:49.104 --> 04:51.104
but you meet one
at a party with a MAGA hat,

04:51.264 --> 04:55.064
and you realize, "Whoa! Maybe I don't
know them as well as I thought I did."

04:55.224 --> 04:57.344
Then the horse stops
because you said "whoa,"

04:57.504 --> 04:59.783
and you have to say,
"I didn't mean that 'whoa,'"

04:59.943 --> 05:01.863
but you're still
judging him for the hat.

05:02.023 --> 05:03.903
And yet incredibly,

05:04.063 --> 05:07.103
Rosselló refused to step down
for over a week,

05:07.263 --> 05:10.383
even trying to stand his ground
during this testy interview

05:10.543 --> 05:12.342
with Fox News's Shep Smith.

05:12.502 --> 05:15.982
Governor, who's come forward to support
you in the middle of this chaos?

05:17.622 --> 05:21.142
-There are folks who supported me.
-Who, specifically, is supporting you?

05:21.302 --> 05:23.862
There are folks that support
the rule of law.

05:24.022 --> 05:26.221
-There are people.
-Could you give me one name?

05:26.381 --> 05:28.581
I see them out there;
there is a protest.

05:28.741 --> 05:30.741
Well, it's... I've talked to people...

05:30.901 --> 05:33.581
-Just one name, Governor.
-From different groups.

05:33.741 --> 05:35.581
A lot of people
from the administration.

05:35.741 --> 05:37.301
Governor, you can't
give me the name

05:37.460 --> 05:39.660
of one person in Puerto Rico
who supports you...

05:39.820 --> 05:43.220
Continuing as governor?
Is that correct?

05:43.380 --> 05:47.900
I can. So the mayor of San Sebastián,
for example, supported this effort.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.179
-Whose name is?
-Uh, from different municipalities.

05:51.339 --> 05:53.459
Javier Jiménez, for example.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.659
That was excruciating.

05:56.819 --> 05:58.939
He took so long
to come up with a name,

05:59.099 --> 06:02.099
you might even be thinking that
he just made Javier Jiménez up.

06:02.259 --> 06:04.098
Well, in fairness to the governor,

06:04.258 --> 06:07.418
I should say Javier Jiménez is in fact
the mayor of San Sebastián,

06:07.578 --> 06:09.338
but there is one problem,

06:09.498 --> 06:12.218
and I think you can
probably guess it.

06:12.378 --> 06:15.298
<i>We spoke to Javier Jiménez</i>
<i>last night via Facetime,</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:18.377
<i>and he says he doesn't support</i>
<i>the governor at all.</i>

06:20.217 --> 06:22.537
<i>I am not supporting him.</i>
<i>Of course not.</i>

06:22.697 --> 06:24.097
<i>That is totally incorrect.</i>

06:24.257 --> 06:25.697
Wow.

06:25.857 --> 06:29.736
So the one name Rosselló
came up with was bullshit,

06:29.896 --> 06:31.936
which is such a stupid mistake.

06:32.096 --> 06:35.016
Why give him a name
they can check in seconds?

06:35.176 --> 06:38.696
When 14-year-olds lie about
having a Canadian girlfriend,

06:38.856 --> 06:41.936
they know to keep the details
vague and untraceable.

06:42.096 --> 06:44.215
They don't say she's Celine Dion

06:44.375 --> 06:47.455
because they'll get found out
immediately.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.935
But finally, on Wednesday,
Governor Rosselló

06:50.095 --> 06:51.935
did announce
he'd leave office next week,

06:52.095 --> 06:53.855
but it's not clear
what happens next.

06:54.015 --> 06:56.014
The next in line was
the secretary of state.

06:56.174 --> 06:58.734
He was also in the group chat
and has already resigned.

06:58.894 --> 07:01.614
The person in line after that
is the secretary of justice,

07:01.774 --> 07:03.814
who protestors think
is too close to Rosselló

07:03.974 --> 07:05.974
and just announced
she doesn't want the job.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.133
So Puerto Rico's future is unclear,
although I will say this.

07:09.293 --> 07:11.613
People there seem
incredibly optimistic.

07:11.773 --> 07:14.773
In fact, Rosselló may have been
a terrible governor,

07:14.933 --> 07:18.453
but he may have inadvertently
accomplished something here.

07:18.613 --> 07:22.892
Thank you, Governor,
because you united one island.

07:23.052 --> 07:26.132
The people in Puerto Rico
altogether were able

07:26.292 --> 07:29.252
to get him out of the seat
that he was in.

07:29.412 --> 07:31.692
The things that we can do
together now

07:31.852 --> 07:34.811
as a whole, you know,
it's totally amazing.

07:34.971 --> 07:36.851
Yeah, it is amazing,

07:37.011 --> 07:40.291
because in a way, by being
such a spectacular shithead,

07:40.451 --> 07:44.331
Rosselló ended up uniting
Puerto Rico in hating him,

07:44.491 --> 07:46.131
and that's an incredible
achievement.

07:46.291 --> 07:50.250
But before he thinks for even a second
that what I said constitutes praise,

07:50.410 --> 07:52.130
I'd like to remind you of the words

07:52.290 --> 07:54.730
of one of his island's
greatest philosophers.

07:54.890 --> 07:58.210
No, bruh, you're not fit
to be governor. Out.

07:58.370 --> 08:02.289
Exactly.
And now, this.

08:02.449 --> 08:08.169
<i>And now, the not-so-secret sadness</i>
<i>of Fox 10 Phoenix's Cory McCloskey.</i>

08:08.329 --> 08:11.809
When we were kids, Troy,
it was fun to climb up on a barn

08:11.969 --> 08:14.968
and then jump off into a wagon
full of maybe hay

08:15.128 --> 08:16.608
or garbage... whatever.

08:16.768 --> 08:20.048
When I was a kid, we always had
to bust these things in half.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.768
I never got a whole popsicle.

08:21.928 --> 08:23.248
-Never?
-No, never.

08:23.408 --> 08:25.248
This is my whole youth:

08:25.408 --> 08:27.487
being whacked in the face
by a snowball.

08:27.647 --> 08:29.407
I grew up in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

08:29.567 --> 08:32.687
-Really?
-Yeah. Small town called Kennett Square.

08:32.847 --> 08:35.006
Kennett Square?
Aw, I lived out that way.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.006
I had to live
on the Jersey side, though.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.246
Not a lot of cooking went on
in our house.

08:39.407 --> 08:40.726
We prepared meals,

08:40.885 --> 08:43.765
but I wouldn't say that my mom
was really a chef.

08:43.926 --> 08:46.726
We all grew up with Crayola,
of course,

08:46.886 --> 08:48.926
and, man, you know who
I always envied?

08:49.086 --> 08:51.926
The kids who had the box
with the sharpener.

08:52.086 --> 08:54.525
I was always reduced
to getting a paring knife out

08:54.685 --> 08:57.005
to try to shave something
into a point.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.445
I grew up with the world's
smallest bounce houses

08:59.605 --> 09:01.725
at the carnivals
where I used to live,

09:01.885 --> 09:03.445
and they always smelled like...

09:03.605 --> 09:07.444
like a combination
of corn chips and feet.

09:07.604 --> 09:10.484
This is all different.
It's out in the open air.

09:10.644 --> 09:12.044
Nothing can hurt you here.

09:15.484 --> 09:17.164
Moving on.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.043
Our main story tonight

09:19.203 --> 09:21.163
concerns the United Kingdom,

09:21.323 --> 09:22.883
home of fascinating wildlife,

09:23.043 --> 09:25.643
like the fearless
mating foxes of Kent,

09:25.803 --> 09:28.443
and beautiful mountains
that go largely unexplored

09:28.603 --> 09:31.003
by the carefree
mating foxes of Kent.

09:31.163 --> 09:33.882
It's also home to some of the world's
most gifted artists,

09:34.042 --> 09:38.242
like whomever took this picture
of the stoic mating foxes of Kent.

09:38.402 --> 09:41.522
Unfortunately, the UK is about
to be completely fucked,

09:41.682 --> 09:45.841
in a way not unlike
the resigned mating foxes of Kent,

09:46.001 --> 09:48.601
and the reason for that
is that this week

09:48.761 --> 09:51.441
the UK had some very big news.

09:51.601 --> 09:53.641
The UK has a new prime minister.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.681
Boris Johnson took over today
from Theresa May,

09:56.841 --> 09:58.320
sealing the transition of power

09:58.480 --> 10:00.120
<i>in a handshake with the queen.</i>

10:00.280 --> 10:02.680
<i>He bowed, then broke the rules</i>

10:02.840 --> 10:05.600
<i>by telling his news staff</i>
<i>what she said.</i>

10:05.760 --> 10:09.840
Exactly, and it was apparently,
and I quote, "Deez nuts."

10:10.000 --> 10:13.119
It's true. She's said it to every
prime minister since Churchill,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.919
and she won't say why.

10:15.079 --> 10:17.679
But yes, incredibly,

10:17.839 --> 10:20.239
Britain's new prime minister
is Boris Johnson.

10:20.399 --> 10:22.639
Even if you know nothing
about British politics,

10:22.799 --> 10:24.838
you're probably already
vaguely aware of him.

10:24.998 --> 10:27.598
As mayor of London, he famously
got stuck on a zip line

10:27.758 --> 10:30.238
while promoting the 2012 Olympics.

10:30.398 --> 10:33.438
And if you've seen a photo of him,
you'll probably remember it,

10:33.598 --> 10:36.958
because it's hard to find one
where he doesn't look ridiculous.

10:37.118 --> 10:40.077
In fact,
everything about his appearance

10:40.237 --> 10:42.757
is consistently, immaculately wrong.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.357
Here he is wearing a bike helmet

10:45.517 --> 10:48.877
that's somehow both too small
and too big for his head.

10:49.037 --> 10:50.516
That's not easy to do.

10:50.676 --> 10:52.556
Here he is looking
like what would happen

10:52.716 --> 10:56.036
if an egg could be both
hairy and sad.

10:56.196 --> 10:57.876
Even his childhood pictures
are funny,

10:58.036 --> 11:01.276
because here he is looking
more like a young Anna Wintour

11:01.436 --> 11:03.915
than I'm guessing she did
at that age.

11:04.075 --> 11:06.755
You may even have seen this clip
that went viral recently

11:06.915 --> 11:10.475
of Boris's endearingly weird answer
to a very simple question

11:10.635 --> 11:13.275
about what he does to relax.

11:13.435 --> 11:17.194
I have a thing
where I make models of...

11:17.354 --> 11:21.114
I mean, realizing that we're mayor of
London, we build beautiful... I make...

11:21.274 --> 11:22.634
Buses.

11:22.794 --> 11:24.514
-You make models of buses?
-I do.

11:24.674 --> 11:25.994
So in Downing Street...

11:26.154 --> 11:29.713
So what I do... no, I didn't mean models
of buses. What I make is...

11:29.873 --> 11:34.713
I get... I get old, um...
I don't know, wooden crates.

11:34.873 --> 11:36.233
-Yeah.
-Right?

11:36.393 --> 11:37.713
And then I paint them.

11:37.873 --> 11:40.873
You make cardboard buses.
That's what you do to enjoy yourself.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.752
No, I paint the passengers
enjoying themselves...

11:43.912 --> 11:47.872
-Okay, great.
-On the wonderful bus.

11:48.032 --> 11:50.912
Okay. Okay, so... so three things
about that.

11:51.072 --> 11:52.792
One, yes, it's magnificent.

11:52.952 --> 11:54.752
Two, there's just no way
that's true.

11:54.912 --> 11:56.591
But three, if it were true,

11:56.751 --> 11:58.511
I now want nothing more than to see

11:58.671 --> 12:00.391
one of those fucking buses,

12:00.551 --> 12:03.271
because if they're terrible,
that's weird.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.191
But if they're impressive,
that's somehow weirder.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.590
The very idea
of the new prime minister

12:09.750 --> 12:13.070
painting crate buses
in his spare time to relax

12:13.230 --> 12:15.750
is just endlessly fascinating.

12:15.910 --> 12:18.030
But Boris is so much more

12:18.190 --> 12:22.069
than the potential Michelangelo
of vehicular crafts.

12:22.229 --> 12:25.469
He was an absolutely crucial leader
in the Brexit campaign,

12:25.629 --> 12:29.229
famously riding around
in a gigantic, red, non-crate bus

12:29.389 --> 12:32.229
with a complete lie
splashed across the side of it.

12:32.389 --> 12:35.508
And now, he is prime minster
and has to face the challenge

12:35.668 --> 12:39.308
of finalizing a Brexit withdrawal deal
by October 31st,

12:39.468 --> 12:41.748
which is less than 100 days
from now.

12:41.908 --> 12:44.148
And the consequences
of messing that up

12:44.308 --> 12:46.108
could have catastrophic
ramifications

12:46.268 --> 12:48.427
for Britain, Europe, and the world.

12:48.587 --> 12:53.387
So we thought it might be helpful
to explain who exactly Boris Johnson is.

12:53.547 --> 12:56.787
And let's start with the fact that
given that Britain's new leader

12:56.947 --> 12:59.627
is a clownish figure
with silly hair

12:59.787 --> 13:01.786
and a passing relationship
with the truth,

13:01.946 --> 13:05.306
you may already be thinking
of the person you're almost always

13:05.466 --> 13:06.906
thinking about anyway.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.866
And you are not alone in that.

13:09.026 --> 13:12.706
There have been countless headlines
comparing Boris to Donald Trump,

13:12.866 --> 13:15.545
and just this week,
Trump did it himself.

13:15.705 --> 13:18.225
They're calling him "Britain Trump",

13:18.385 --> 13:21.745
and people are saying that's good,
that they like me over there.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.305
No, they don't.
Nope, they... they don't.

13:24.465 --> 13:25.785
They absolutely do not.

13:25.945 --> 13:30.504
They don't like you over there,
and no one ever says "Britain Trump"

13:30.664 --> 13:32.744
unless it's in the context
of a sentence like,

13:32.904 --> 13:37.104
"I'm getting the fuck out of Britain;
Trump is coming to visit this weekend."

13:37.264 --> 13:41.623
But to call Boris Johnson
"Britain Trump"

13:41.783 --> 13:45.303
is neither exactly wrong
nor exactly right.

13:45.463 --> 13:48.023
Johnson is actually
a lot more complex than Trump

13:48.183 --> 13:49.503
in a number of important ways.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.742
For one, while Trump tells you
he has "the best words" but doesn't,

13:53.902 --> 13:57.022
Johnson is more than happy
to show you how erudite he is.

13:57.182 --> 13:59.862
Just watch him charmingly drop
some sporting trivia

14:00.022 --> 14:01.742
ahead of the London Olympics.

14:01.902 --> 14:05.741
Ping-pong was invented on
the dining tables of England,

14:05.901 --> 14:07.941
ladies and gentlemen,
in the 19th century.

14:08.101 --> 14:10.861
It was, and it was called
"whiff-whaff."

14:11.021 --> 14:12.941
And there you have
the essential difference

14:13.101 --> 14:14.701
between us
and the rest of the world.

14:14.861 --> 14:17.301
Other nations, the French,
looked at a dining table

14:17.461 --> 14:19.660
and saw an opportunity
to have dinner.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.260
We looked at a dining table

14:21.420 --> 14:24.180
and saw an opportunity
to play whiff-whaff.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.020
Look, look, yes.

14:26.180 --> 14:28.380
I will admit
that is objectively funny,

14:28.540 --> 14:31.380
although I'm not sure
that that whiff-whaff anecdote

14:31.540 --> 14:33.259
reflects quite as well
on the British

14:33.419 --> 14:34.739
as he's implying there.

14:34.899 --> 14:37.139
The French looked to the dining table
as a canvas

14:37.299 --> 14:39.219
upon which to create
exceptional cuisine,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.739
and the British saw a way to
basically invent mouse tennis.

14:42.899 --> 14:46.818
And look, Johnson is more than happy
to look ridiculous.

14:46.978 --> 14:51.498
It's enabled him to not just survive
when he fucks up, but actually benefit.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.738
That absurd zip line photo
from the Olympics

14:53.898 --> 14:56.338
would have killed
most politicians' careers,

14:56.498 --> 15:00.057
but Boris found a way to laugh
at himself and charm everyone.

15:00.217 --> 15:02.817
Just watch how it got covered
on the news at the time.

15:02.977 --> 15:04.297
<i>Isn't that fantastic?</i>

15:04.457 --> 15:08.017
<i>This is a man who some are tipping</i>
<i>as a future prime minister.</i>

15:08.177 --> 15:10.697
<i>Look, I think if anyone</i>
<i>has won the Olympics,</i>

15:10.856 --> 15:12.896
<i>I would say it's Boris Johnson.</i>

15:13.056 --> 15:14.976
Hold on.
Hold on there.

15:15.136 --> 15:17.256
"If" anyone won the Olympics?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.216
To be clear, people definitely
won the Olympics,

15:20.376 --> 15:21.936
specifically the winners.

15:22.096 --> 15:24.495
The winners won the Olympics.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.175
And in a nutshell,

15:26.335 --> 15:28.615
that has been the root
of Boris's appeal...

15:28.775 --> 15:31.015
a loveable mess weathering adversity

15:31.175 --> 15:32.815
with humor and good cheer.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.735
But the truth is,

15:34.895 --> 15:37.134
there may be a great deal
more calculation

15:37.294 --> 15:39.134
behind that image
than first appears,

15:39.294 --> 15:40.894
because Boris learned
at an early age

15:41.054 --> 15:43.534
the benefits of making yourself
the butt of the joke,

15:43.694 --> 15:45.814
as his own sister remembers.

15:45.974 --> 15:48.254
<i>He discovered he could</i>
<i>make people laugh.</i>

15:48.414 --> 15:50.653
When he was in a French play,

15:50.813 --> 15:54.013
he had to recite Molière and he hadn't
bothered to learn his lines,

15:54.173 --> 15:56.173
and he hid behind a pillow
reading them out,

15:56.333 --> 15:59.653
which was obviously much funnier
than if he'd learnt them perfectly

15:59.813 --> 16:03.332
and had stood on the stage
and declaimed them.

16:03.492 --> 16:05.612
Yeah, obviously.

16:05.772 --> 16:08.212
It's always funnier
when things go wrong,

16:08.372 --> 16:12.212
like in this photo of Johnson shaking
hands with the queen... Oh, no.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.972
Oh, what an embarrassing mistake.

16:15.132 --> 16:17.051
See? Objectively funnier.

16:17.211 --> 16:21.811
And by the way, how are neither
of you into this?

16:21.971 --> 16:26.651
Boris... Boris actually learned
a great deal from that incident

16:26.811 --> 16:28.611
as he himself will admit.

16:28.771 --> 16:31.690
Do you think that you learnt
something for later life

16:31.850 --> 16:33.610
from acting in plays at Eton?

16:33.770 --> 16:35.450
You could actually get more laughs

16:35.610 --> 16:37.970
by looking as if
you don't know your lines

16:38.130 --> 16:40.410
than actually remembering them.

16:40.570 --> 16:42.449
Well, I certainly think that

16:42.609 --> 16:45.289
as a general tactic in life,

16:45.449 --> 16:47.529
if that's what you're driving at,

16:47.689 --> 16:51.809
it is often useful...

16:51.969 --> 16:54.329
to give the slight impression

16:54.489 --> 16:58.328
that you are deliberately pretending
not to know what is going on.

16:58.488 --> 17:01.128
The reality may be that you
don't know what is going on,

17:01.288 --> 17:02.968
but people can't tell the difference.

17:03.128 --> 17:07.488
And that, right there,
is the key to Boris Johnson,

17:07.647 --> 17:10.686
presenting his own lack
of preparation so charmingly

17:10.847 --> 17:13.166
that you actually doubt
he's unprepared,

17:13.327 --> 17:15.207
but he is.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.887
It's an incredibly powerful trick,
and incidentally, it's clips like that

17:19.047 --> 17:22.406
that are one major reason
why Boris is not the Britain Trump,

17:22.566 --> 17:26.445
because can you imagine Trump
having that level of self-reflection?

17:26.606 --> 17:30.726
"Look, with 'covfefe,'
the tactic was to present myself

17:30.886 --> 17:32.806
"as a kind of sub-literate clown

17:32.966 --> 17:36.445
"and to distract you from the fact
that I'm a mound of skin

17:36.605 --> 17:38.645
"tautly stretched
across the howling chasm

17:38.805 --> 17:40.525
of the space
where a soul should be."

17:40.685 --> 17:45.725
That's... it's a very useful tool
when deployed well.

17:45.885 --> 17:47.284
The point here is, though,

17:47.444 --> 17:50.724
Johnson's bumbling persona
is a carefully calibrated act.

17:50.884 --> 17:55.924
Take his hair. Multiple people have said
he actually messes it up on purpose.

17:56.084 --> 17:57.444
A BBC producer tweeted

17:57.604 --> 17:59.044
that "he'd always ruffle it

17:59.204 --> 18:01.043
right before the camera
started rolling,"

18:01.203 --> 18:02.883
which kind of makes sense,
doesn't it?

18:03.043 --> 18:05.283
He's been on TV hundreds of times,

18:05.443 --> 18:07.603
and he always looks like a mess.

18:07.763 --> 18:10.883
What were the chances that
before every one of those appearances,

18:11.043 --> 18:14.642
he combed, gelled,
and carefully part his hair

18:14.802 --> 18:17.962
only to then be hit in the face
by a goose

18:18.122 --> 18:19.762
right as they started filming?

18:19.922 --> 18:23.282
No, he looks like that
because he wants to.

18:23.442 --> 18:27.841
Or take his clothing. He's often seen
outside in eccentric, chaotic outfits,

18:28.001 --> 18:29.881
but he knows how to dress.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.641
He just also knows that
that is a more relatable image

18:32.801 --> 18:35.841
than this one from when he was
in the notoriously elite

18:36.001 --> 18:38.241
Bullingdon Club at Oxford University

18:38.401 --> 18:40.000
with his friend David Cameron.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.680
Now, that photo was
a huge liability for Cameron

18:43.840 --> 18:45.240
but not for Johnson,

18:45.400 --> 18:47.360
because he's cleverly
inoculated himself

18:47.520 --> 18:49.760
against that image
of astonishing privilege

18:49.920 --> 18:52.679
by presenting himself
as a cartoon Englishman

18:52.839 --> 18:54.799
who dresses like a raccoon
who just emerged

18:54.959 --> 18:57.559
from David Foster Wallace's trash.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.719
And once you realize what he is doing,
it makes you question everything

19:01.879 --> 19:04.119
that you previously found
charming about him.

19:04.279 --> 19:07.158
Remember that clip where he's
talking about painting buses?

19:07.318 --> 19:08.678
Undeniably funny,

19:08.838 --> 19:12.358
but some in Britain have pointed out
that it might have been an attempt

19:12.518 --> 19:14.838
to change the Google search results
people receive

19:14.998 --> 19:17.638
when they looked for something like
"Boris Johnson bus,"

19:17.798 --> 19:20.117
meaning that people would see
that delightful clip

19:20.277 --> 19:23.237
rather than this significantly
less delightful bullshit.

19:23.397 --> 19:25.477
Now, was that actually
his intention?

19:25.637 --> 19:29.517
It's impossible to know,
but you can't rule it out either.

19:29.677 --> 19:31.556
And once you see the possibility

19:31.716 --> 19:34.676
that his gaffes are in fact
calculated manipulations,

19:34.836 --> 19:36.516
you can't unsee it.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.716
It's like looking at the FedEx logo
and finally noticing the arrow.

19:40.876 --> 19:42.196
Or...

19:42.356 --> 19:44.076
Or looking at the Starbucks logo

19:44.236 --> 19:46.515
and finally noticing
Robert De Niro's face.

19:46.675 --> 19:51.555
You can never look at it
in quite the same way again.

19:51.715 --> 19:54.035
And beneath all of
Boris's surface charm

19:54.195 --> 19:56.435
are some truly nasty elements.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.474
For one thing, he is a liar.

19:58.634 --> 20:00.834
He was fired from his first job
as a journalist,

20:00.994 --> 20:04.034
at "The Times" of London
for completely making up a quote.

20:04.194 --> 20:08.034
In fact, his editor claims
Johnson was the "single worst employee"

20:08.194 --> 20:09.634
he's ever had,

20:09.794 --> 20:13.993
"and skipped many work days to hang out
with his best friend, Jeffrey Epstein,"

20:14.153 --> 20:15.593
which is terrible.

20:15.753 --> 20:18.753
It's not true;
I just made that quote up.

20:18.913 --> 20:22.233
But now, you can see
just how irresponsible it is

20:22.393 --> 20:24.432
to fabricate them.

20:24.592 --> 20:28.432
And from there, Johnson failed upwards
to a job at "The Daily Telegraph,"

20:28.592 --> 20:31.592
where he built a following
on a series of flagrant falsehoods

20:31.752 --> 20:34.472
about the European Union
as their Brussels correspondent...

20:34.632 --> 20:36.991
falsehoods that would help
lay the groundwork

20:37.151 --> 20:39.351
for the Brexit vote decades later.

20:39.511 --> 20:42.791
Johnson even admits that he had
something called a "save-get."

20:42.951 --> 20:46.591
It's a key command like a copy-paste
of a phrase that he liked to use

20:46.751 --> 20:49.271
to paint a caricature of the EU.

20:49.431 --> 20:53.550
I had a sort of "save-get."
Do you still have "save-get" keys?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.310
A "save-get" kind of intro,

20:55.470 --> 21:00.150
which was "Britain stood alone
last night as..."

21:00.310 --> 21:04.149
and then I'd fill in whatever it was,
"As Europe proceeded with plans

21:04.309 --> 21:06.629
to abolish the prawn cocktail
flavor crisp,"

21:06.789 --> 21:08.909
or... or whatever.

21:09.069 --> 21:12.029
Okay.
So, first, for those unfamiliar,

21:12.189 --> 21:14.029
prawn cocktail crisps are real.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.068
They shouldn't be, but they are.

21:16.228 --> 21:18.828
And to explain,
it's what happens when a country

21:18.988 --> 21:21.868
looks at a dining table
and foregoes food

21:22.028 --> 21:25.988
in favor of playing whiff-whaff,
but Johnson...

21:26.148 --> 21:29.387
Johnson actually did write
a series of columns

21:29.547 --> 21:32.627
claiming Europe was attempting to ban
the prawn cocktail crisp,

21:32.787 --> 21:34.507
which was a complete lie.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.867
Europe was never planning
to abolish them,

21:37.027 --> 21:39.227
and they immediately
pointed that out.

21:39.387 --> 21:42.826
But Boris's allegation
spread like wildfire

21:42.986 --> 21:45.786
and became a popular example
of an out-of-control EU,

21:45.946 --> 21:48.026
and as recently as 2016,

21:48.186 --> 21:52.706
a full 25 years after his bullshit
was completely debunked,

21:52.866 --> 21:55.025
Boris actually cited "the great war

21:55.185 --> 21:57.345
against the British
prawn cocktail crisp"

21:57.505 --> 21:59.185
as part of his case for Brexit.

21:59.345 --> 22:01.865
And by the way,
if there ever is a great war

22:02.025 --> 22:05.145
against the prawn cocktail crisp,
there will be no winners.

22:05.305 --> 22:07.305
Believe me, because...

22:07.465 --> 22:10.024
I will say this.
Eating them...

22:12.144 --> 22:15.944
It's... it's like eating
a cremated mermaid.

22:16.104 --> 22:18.824
But... but in a bad way.

22:18.984 --> 22:20.704
And...

22:20.863 --> 22:23.183
Oh, that's bad.
And look, look...

22:24.943 --> 22:29.703
Look, look, it would be bad enough
if Boris were just a liar.

22:29.863 --> 22:33.862
He's also been more than willing to tap
into outright bigotry to get ahead.

22:34.022 --> 22:36.222
He's made repeated references
to some immigrants

22:36.382 --> 22:38.542
as people that want
to "leech off the state,"

22:38.702 --> 22:41.422
and over the years he's made
references to "piccaninnies."

22:41.582 --> 22:44.662
He said the people of Congo
had "watermelon smiles,"

22:44.822 --> 22:47.821
he's called gay men
"tank-topped bumboys,"

22:47.981 --> 22:50.661
and just last year, there was this.

22:50.821 --> 22:52.581
<i>"They look like letterboxes,"</i>

22:52.741 --> 22:54.581
<i>Boris Johnson wrote on Monday.</i>

22:54.741 --> 22:56.821
<i>He even compared women who wear them</i>

22:56.981 --> 22:58.461
<i>to bank robbers.</i>

22:58.621 --> 23:01.020
That is an appalling comment

23:01.180 --> 23:03.980
that leaves a truly disgusting
taste in your mouth,

23:04.140 --> 23:06.820
much like the shrimp crisp dust

23:06.980 --> 23:11.700
that has very much voted
to remain on my fucking tongue.

23:11.860 --> 23:14.819
And look, when reporters camped
outside Johnson's house,

23:14.979 --> 23:18.419
he really turned the cartoon
version of himself up to 11,

23:18.579 --> 23:21.539
ruffling up his hair,
donning an absurd outfit,

23:21.699 --> 23:23.179
and waddling out to charm them,

23:23.339 --> 23:25.978
and just watch how
depressingly effective

23:26.138 --> 23:27.658
it winds up being.

23:27.818 --> 23:30.498
-Do you apologize for what...
-Will you have a cup of tea?

23:30.658 --> 23:32.698
-Will you apologize...
-Would you like a cup?

23:32.858 --> 23:34.418
-Yeah, sure.
-Go on. Have a cuppa.

23:34.578 --> 23:36.738
Thank you, thank you.
Do you regret...

23:36.898 --> 23:39.257
-Would you like a cup?
-Do you regret your comment?

23:39.417 --> 23:41.977
-Do you regret your comment?
-Go on, have a cup of tea.

23:42.137 --> 23:44.337
-Thank you very much.
-There you go.

23:44.497 --> 23:46.497
-There you go.
-Do you regret your comment?

23:46.657 --> 23:48.337
I want you
to have a cup of tea.

23:48.497 --> 23:50.897
If I have a cup of tea,
will you answer my question?

23:51.057 --> 23:54.296
No, I'm here solely
on a humanitarian mission.

23:54.456 --> 23:57.296
You've been here all day,
and you've been incredibly patient

23:57.456 --> 23:59.136
and incredibly...
I feel sorry for you,

23:59.296 --> 24:02.336
'cause I have nothing to say,
except offer you some tea!

24:02.496 --> 24:04.376
-Okay.
-Okay? Go on.

24:04.536 --> 24:06.855
-Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.
-Go on.

24:07.015 --> 24:08.535
No!

24:08.695 --> 24:10.215
Don't take the tea,

24:10.375 --> 24:12.015
and do not thank him for it!

24:12.175 --> 24:14.295
Because think about
what just happened there.

24:14.455 --> 24:16.895
He referred to Muslim women
as letterboxes,

24:17.055 --> 24:18.734
and in the space of 30 seconds,

24:18.894 --> 24:20.494
he had them laughing along
with them.

24:20.654 --> 24:23.134
He was in trouble,
he put on full Brit face,

24:23.294 --> 24:25.374
and those journalists
fucking fell for it.

24:25.534 --> 24:27.654
And for the record,
I can say Brit face.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.174
You can't.

24:29.334 --> 24:31.693
I can definitely say it.

24:31.853 --> 24:34.053
We can say it together;
you can't say it at all.

24:34.213 --> 24:35.613
That's the rule.

24:35.773 --> 24:38.733
But unfortunately,
Boris the prime minister

24:38.893 --> 24:41.573
may have hit the limits
of where that charm can take him,

24:41.733 --> 24:45.252
because crucially,
he now has less than 100 days

24:45.412 --> 24:46.852
to negotiate a Brexit deal.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.932
And his well-engineered,
clumsy Brit persona

24:50.092 --> 24:52.012
does not necessarily travel well.

24:52.172 --> 24:54.412
We saw that during his time
as foreign secretary.

24:54.572 --> 24:57.771
In 2017, he was in Myanmar,
where for some reason

24:57.931 --> 24:59.851
he kept muttering Rudyard Kipling's

25:00.011 --> 25:03.211
colonialist poem "Mandalay"
to himself.

25:16.450 --> 25:17.970
Oh, yeah.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.890
<i>The ambassador is quick to spot</i>

25:20.050 --> 25:22.530
<i>that reminding their hosts</i>
<i>of British rule</i>

25:22.690 --> 25:24.689
<i>might not be wise.</i>

25:35.169 --> 25:38.408
Is it good stuff?
Or is that actually bad stuff?

25:38.568 --> 25:40.808
'Cause I'd argue,
as a foreign secretary,

25:40.968 --> 25:42.488
it's best not to remind people

25:42.648 --> 25:45.968
of when your country subjugated theirs
for more than a century.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.688
It honestly would've been
more diplomatic at that point

25:48.848 --> 25:53.327
to recite the lyrics to
"My neck, My Back", by Khia.

25:53.487 --> 25:55.047
"My neck, my back,

25:55.207 --> 25:57.207
lick my pussy and my crack."

25:57.367 --> 25:59.407
Good stuff, good stuff.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.687
And look, that...

26:01.847 --> 26:03.526
that wasn't a one-off.

26:03.686 --> 26:06.966
Johnson's time in the foreign office
was littered with gaffes,

26:07.126 --> 26:10.406
as this journalist explains
with the help of a visual aid.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.126
I've spoken to one figure

26:12.286 --> 26:14.406
who said that working
with Boris Johnson

26:14.566 --> 26:17.525
is like walking a few feet
behind a horse

26:17.685 --> 26:19.445
shoveling its shit.

26:21.125 --> 26:24.245
Wow. That is a striking quote,

26:24.405 --> 26:26.605
although I'm not really sure
why that journalist

26:26.765 --> 26:29.484
felt the need to be
next to a horse to deliver it.

26:29.644 --> 26:31.524
How do you pitch that
to the stable owner?

26:31.684 --> 26:35.204
"Look, I'm just worried that people
have forgotten what horses look like,

26:35.364 --> 26:39.644
"so please stand aside while I humiliate
your animal on the news."

26:39.804 --> 26:43.363
And the problem is, if Johnson messes up
the Brexit negotiation,

26:43.523 --> 26:46.603
the pile-up of shit
could be considerable here,

26:46.763 --> 26:49.123
as most economists believe
a no-deal Brexit

26:49.283 --> 26:50.883
would cause a deep recession.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.482
And the EU may be extra immune
to Boris's charms.

26:54.642 --> 26:57.602
Remember, he was a key figure
in the Brexit campaign

26:57.762 --> 27:01.202
and has lied about them for decades
in his newspaper columns,

27:01.362 --> 27:04.642
on top of which he has privately
referred to the French as "turds"

27:04.802 --> 27:07.561
and publicly compared
the EU to Hitler.

27:07.721 --> 27:09.161
So he's not working

27:09.321 --> 27:11.281
with a lot of goodwill
at this point.

27:11.441 --> 27:14.641
And Boris has made extravagant,
unkeepable promises,

27:14.801 --> 27:17.041
including that he will somehow
devise a way

27:17.201 --> 27:19.561
to sever northern Ireland
from the EU

27:19.721 --> 27:22.160
without creating a hard border
with Ireland.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.840
But his suggestions cannot work,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.760
and EU Commissioner
Jean-Claude Juncker

27:26.920 --> 27:29.480
has responded
pretty clearly to them.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.160
<i>Juncker reiterated</i>
<i>that "the EU's position</i>

27:32.320 --> 27:36.799
<i>"that the Withdrawal Agreement is</i>
<i>the best and only agreement possible."</i>

27:36.959 --> 27:39.439
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>Juncker said no to Johnson.</i>

27:39.599 --> 27:41.359
Yeah, of course he did,

27:41.519 --> 27:44.039
so Johnson is shit out of luck
at this point.

27:44.199 --> 27:47.998
His bumbling charm may work wonders
in low-stakes situations,

27:48.158 --> 27:49.878
but that's not where he is now.

27:50.038 --> 27:54.558
Think of it like this. Hugh Grant is
delightful in romantic comedies...

27:54.718 --> 27:56.518
the stammering, the hesitation,

27:56.678 --> 27:58.918
the inability to relate
to his surroundings

27:59.078 --> 28:01.077
with any level of competence.

28:01.237 --> 28:04.397
You want to see Hugh Grant in
"Four Weddings and a Funeral,"

28:04.557 --> 28:07.797
but no one wants to see him
in "United 93,"

28:07.957 --> 28:11.597
because the context would make
his character a lot less charming.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.436
"Sorry, I just... um, well,

28:13.596 --> 28:15.796
"ah, this is a...
really a stupid question,

28:15.956 --> 28:18.956
"Particularly
in view of your recent jihad,

28:19.116 --> 28:23.036
"but I just wondered if by any chance,
in the words of David Cassidy,

28:23.196 --> 28:25.356
"when he was still with
'The Partridge Family,'

28:25.516 --> 28:27.395
"I believe, uh,
you might be persuaded to,

28:27.555 --> 28:29.435
should Allah will it, obviously..."

28:29.595 --> 28:33.595
"Land-land-land this plane. Um...

28:33.755 --> 28:36.955
Allahu, as I believe
you say it, Akbar."

28:37.115 --> 28:40.674
Because...
yeah, it's less good.

28:40.834 --> 28:44.794
It's less good in a situation
that matters,

28:44.954 --> 28:49.114
because Johnson cannot get what
he wants or has promised here,

28:49.274 --> 28:51.953
and his only hope of avoiding
complete catastrophe

28:52.113 --> 28:54.753
is through focus, discipline,
and detail.

28:54.913 --> 28:58.153
But those are three Achilles heels
of his. I'll show you.

28:58.313 --> 29:02.473
One of his great plans for mitigating
the potentially catastrophic effects

29:02.633 --> 29:07.032
of a no-deal Brexit is to suggest that
if the UK misses that October deadline,

29:07.192 --> 29:11.952
it could simply trade freely with the EU
under Article 24, paragraph 5B

29:12.112 --> 29:13.992
of this existing trade agreement,

29:14.152 --> 29:17.032
but... and you do not need
to know the details of this...

29:17.192 --> 29:19.791
the very next paragraph, 5C,

29:19.951 --> 29:22.191
makes it clear that
that is simply not possible.

29:22.351 --> 29:25.151
And just watch as a journalist
who actually understood that

29:25.311 --> 29:26.951
challenged Johnson on it.

29:27.111 --> 29:30.151
You talk about Article 5B
in paragraph 24.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.950
Paragraph 5B. Article 24.

29:32.110 --> 29:34.430
-Get the detail right, Andrew.
-Article 5...

29:34.590 --> 29:36.670
It's Article 24, paragraph 5B.

29:36.830 --> 29:39.950
And how would you handle
paragraph 5C?

29:40.110 --> 29:45.069
I would... I would confide entirely
in paragraph 5B, because that is...

29:45.229 --> 29:47.229
But how would you get around
what's in 5C?

29:47.389 --> 29:50.829
I'd confide entirely in paragraph 5B,
which is enough for our purposes.

29:50.989 --> 29:52.789
-Do you know what's in 5C?
-No.

29:54.149 --> 29:57.548
Oh, for fuck's sake!

29:57.708 --> 30:00.228
That "no" was delivered
with the confidence of a man

30:00.388 --> 30:03.828
who doesn't know what he's talking
about, but thinks it doesn't matter.

30:03.988 --> 30:06.948
It's a "no" that says, "Yeah,
I'm full of shit. So what?

30:07.108 --> 30:11.467
"Just walk a few feet behind me
and clean it up with a shovel."

30:11.627 --> 30:16.387
But that lack of attention to detail
for a process that has the potential

30:16.547 --> 30:19.387
to impact millions of people
is really alarming,

30:19.547 --> 30:21.947
and there is no reason
for much hope here,

30:22.107 --> 30:25.626
because all the skills that have helped
Johnson to become prime minister

30:25.786 --> 30:28.066
will not paper over
all of the deficits

30:28.226 --> 30:30.546
that are going to make him
terrible at that job.

30:30.706 --> 30:32.546
Johnson has backed himself
into a corner,

30:32.706 --> 30:34.866
because Parliament has rejected
the EU's deal;

30:35.026 --> 30:37.665
the EU says there is
no better deal to be had.

30:37.825 --> 30:40.105
There is really no good way
out of this,

30:40.265 --> 30:42.185
meaning that
he's pretty much stranded...

30:42.345 --> 30:44.025
and not the charming kind
of stranded

30:44.185 --> 30:47.065
that means you've somehow
won the Olympics,

30:47.225 --> 30:50.944
because this time that zip line
isn't over Olympic spectators.

30:51.104 --> 30:52.464
It's over a volcano.

30:52.624 --> 30:55.024
It's set to erupt
in three months' time,

30:55.184 --> 30:57.224
and the only people
who can help get him down

30:57.384 --> 31:00.224
are the same people he's accused
of being turds and Hitlers.

31:00.384 --> 31:03.383
And unfortunately for Johnson,
Britain, Europe, and the world,

31:03.543 --> 31:08.303
I just don't think he's gonna be able
to whiff-whaff his way out of this one.

31:08.463 --> 31:10.543
And now, this.

31:10.703 --> 31:15.902
<i>And now, CNBC's Joe Kernen</i>
<i>irritates his co-workers.</i>

31:16.062 --> 31:18.702
Rami Malek's teeth... those fake teeth

31:18.862 --> 31:21.662
actually won Best Actor, I think.

31:21.822 --> 31:24.062
Did they not, or...?

31:24.222 --> 31:26.182
Uh, no, I think they did not.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.902
-You're not a baby powder guy?
-No.

31:28.061 --> 31:29.941
Baby skin.
If you get a little bit older...

31:30.101 --> 31:31.901
-I have it already.
-Get a bit older,

31:32.061 --> 31:34.341
-...gravity takes over.
-The baby powder...

31:34.501 --> 31:36.421
-Gravity takes over?
-Eventually.

31:36.581 --> 31:38.941
Is that what you want to tell
Americans at 6:08?

31:39.101 --> 31:40.781
It's just a fact, right, Mac?

31:40.941 --> 31:42.820
There are big...
specific type of sweat...

31:42.980 --> 31:46.860
-Ugh. So gross.
-Glands in your ear canal, Andrew.

31:47.020 --> 31:49.100
-Really...
-Active. Active ones.

31:49.260 --> 31:50.580
-It's spectacular.
-It's fast.

31:50.740 --> 31:53.620
It's real. They're real,
and they're spectacular.
