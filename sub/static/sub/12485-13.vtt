I can't believe
Halloween is in
three days.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.651
(GIGGLES) I know!

00:20.651 --> 00:22.253
I know.
It seems like
only yesterday

00:22.253 --> 00:24.225
Halloween was
in four days.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.627
This is definitely
my favorite holiday.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.261
This is the one day a year
we mutants don't
stick out like sore thumbs.

00:30.261 --> 00:31.202
Especially Tom.

00:38.109 --> 00:40.241
Hey, Big Brain.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.673
So, want to go to
the Halloween party
with me on Friday?

00:42.673 --> 00:44.545
Angus, the only way
I'd go with you

00:44.545 --> 00:45.546
is if you were the
last boy on Earth!

00:47.418 --> 00:48.349

02:05.826 --> 02:08.229
for all your Frankenstein
and frankfurter needs.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.132
We're looking for
human costumes.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.766
Something that will
make us look hideous
and misshapen.

02:15.766 --> 02:17.137
You know, like you.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.871
I didn't achieve this
with a costume.

02:20.871 --> 02:23.644
It took years
of poor diet
and improper hygiene.

02:28.379 --> 02:30.551
Okay, here's the
mask for your costume.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.484
Do you have
any other questions?

02:33.484 --> 02:35.886
Yeah.
The weird guy
in the litter box,

02:35.886 --> 02:37.458
is he okay?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.789
Is someone
coming to get him?

02:41.392 --> 02:43.394
No, I meant
important questions,

my phone number,

may be the man

you could get me

mean to complain

there were two of me.

Just make sure
she writes my paper
and doesn't leave this room,

08:02.813 --> 08:05.586
or your next meal
will be your own foot!

to stay inside

out with me.

have one option.

and run into the arms
of the nearest vampire?

a better idea.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.691
I am one of those humans.

Therefore,
I will have toast.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.067

before I came.

we should eat
here anyway.

saw a mouse.

the party on Friday,

11:41.271 --> 11:43.003

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
it'd be fun for us
to do a two-person
costume together.

I have it set on "shock."

I'm at work.

finish the paper?

I didn't think of
a homework clone before.

Here's my new
calculus assignment.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.765

go with this one.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.175
You sure? It's so hot,

13:25.175 --> 13:28.108
I feel like I'm
wearing two costumes,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.240
which I'm
obviously not, because

13:30.240 --> 13:32.082
that would be ridiculous.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.897
All right,
I'm spying on
Chyna on her date.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.060
He stole my girl.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.103
How does he look at
himself in the mirror?

13:53.103 --> 13:54.965
Seriously, I'd like to know.
Is there a trick
or something? I mean...

14:03.043 --> 14:04.474
Chyna?

14:04.474 --> 14:06.346
That girl is not Chyna.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.448
It is.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.020
She doesn't want him
to know she's a mutant,

14:10.020 --> 14:11.481
so she's pretending
to be a human.

14:11.481 --> 14:14.154
She's not being
very convincing.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.255
She's not even
eating toast.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.859
Well, it would
be a shame

to find out the

Holland, it's time
for you to see
the real Chyna!

14:40.410 --> 14:42.052
Sorry. Let me
try that again.

Holland, it's time
for you to see
the real Chyna!

Oh, come on!

Holland, it's time
for you to see
the real Chyna!

14:58.468 --> 15:00.130
Hello, fellow human.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.932
How about that
weather and/or politics
we're having?

15:07.938 --> 15:11.181
This is the real Chyna!
She's a mutant!

15:11.181 --> 15:12.612
She's joking, right?

Thanks,
but I could've gotten
out of the tree myself.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.448
I took Chyna's head off
and Holland still doesn't
notice how beautiful I am!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.650
I could tell him
about all the beauty
pageants I've won,

15:50.650 --> 15:52.322
but I don't want
to sound braggy.

15:52.322 --> 15:54.684
So I just wore this.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.992
You're trying
too hard, sweetie.

16:01.992 --> 16:04.134

I'll save it for dessert.

16:19.079 --> 16:23.313
So, any chance
you'll reconsider being
my date to the party?

16:23.313 --> 16:26.686
A party?
I've heard about
these things called parties.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.687
Sure, I'd love to go!

16:27.687 --> 16:30.060
Really?
 Mmm-hmm.

16:30.060 --> 16:32.322
You're not just pulling
my leg, are you?

16:32.322 --> 16:34.994
Because this one
is rotting and if you do,
it'll fall right off.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.306
Huh.

16:46.306 --> 16:50.110
I thought
I saw my clone
out in the hallway...

16:50.110 --> 16:52.512
That's impossible, sir.

and it's been in here

your Spanish homework.

17:05.055 --> 17:06.296
Huh.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.728
I must've just
imagined seeing it.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.030
(STAMMERING)
Because you're
stressed out.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.204
You know what would
help you relax, sir? Yoga.

You're right. Good idea.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.308
Yoga!

Olive, I need
your help to solve this
situation with Holland.

the ultimate sacrifice.

ultimate sacrifice.

turn me human so me and
Holland can be together.

Can you do that?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.614
Sure. I mean,
if that's what
you want.

turn you human,
it can clone you,

a fun carnival game.

she pays me.

give you a ride, Tom.

No, no, look,
I was wrong.

18:54.564 --> 18:59.709
So you're a monster.
But you're also sweet,
and kind, and funny.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.611
I don't care
what you look like,

19:01.611 --> 19:03.443
so you can
take off that costume.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.175
(CHUCKLES)

19:05.175 --> 19:08.218
That's the best part.
This isn't a costume.

into a human so we
could be together!

you're kidding.

like this look?

a costume either.

me into a monster,
so we could be together.

me for one minute?

Holland into a monster?

the entire point
of turning me human!

into a monster.

then who did?

to be with Chyna.

being gruesome.

hear your life story.
