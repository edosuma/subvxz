00:03.699 --> 00:06.441
- So as y'all know, my dad
has been hounding us

00:06.484 --> 00:10.053
for the last couple
of years to have a baby.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.663
- From you for my birthday
is to hear,

00:11.707 --> 00:15.058
"Hey, Dad, you're going to be
a grandfather again."

00:15.102 --> 00:18.366
Wanted to make sure that you
were up on, you know, babies

00:18.409 --> 00:20.803
and how to make them stuff
like that and cool with that.

00:20.846 --> 00:24.241

- No, no, no, human babies.

it was supposed to happen

00:26.026 --> 00:27.331
the night of the wedding.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.768
- Do I need to explain
how babies are made

00:29.812 --> 00:31.161
and where they come from?

00:31.205 --> 00:34.034
- No, I know.
I'm--I'm fully aware.

your grandma involved.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.783

which is really embarrassing.

09:14.423 --> 09:17.295

to visualize ideas.

So what do I do with it?

09:22.779 --> 09:24.128

what your vision is.

to get pregnant.

maybe moving to Texas
